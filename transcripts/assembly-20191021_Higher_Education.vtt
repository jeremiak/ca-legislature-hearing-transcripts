00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:07.505
THIS HEARING IS TIMELY. IT WAS

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:09.207

CS USE QUANTITATIVE REASONING

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.946
ADMISSION PROPOSAL. WHEN. I

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.715
FIRST LEARNED OF THE PROPOSAL I

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:20.752
WAS VERY SURPRISED. WHY AND I

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:21.620
AS CHAIR OF THE HIGHER

EDUCATION COMMITTEE BEEN MADE

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:27.592
AWARE OF THE PROPOSAL BY CSU.

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.228
THEN I FOUND OUT. OF FROM MY

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:33.365
COLLEAGUES THAT MOST OF THEM

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:33.999
WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:38.603
EITHER. WELL THERE BEEN A FEW

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.506
OTHER IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT I

I THINK THAT IT'S SIMPLY THAT

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:58.189
IMPORTANT. THE GOAL OF THIS

00:25:58.256 --> 00:25:59.491
HEARING IS TO LEARN DIRECTLY

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:02.427

PROPOSAL HAS NOT NECESSARILY

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:18.977
BEEN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.478
BETWEEN THE CSU AND STAKEHOLDER

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.781

COURSES FOR GRADUATION AND

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.947
ULTIMATELY FOR PREPARATION. AND

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:31.182
THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT WE THINK

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.584
OF TODAY'S ATG. WAS IN SOME

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.952
SENSE EVEN MORE SPECIFIC BACK

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:36.354
THAT THE IN ITS FIRST THEN THE

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.955
FIRST VERY ITERATIONS. SO

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.624
RATHER THAN THE GENERAL THINGS

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:40.625
THAT WE THINK ABOUT TODAY THE

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.593
UNIVERSITY SAID YOU MUST HAVE

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.128
COMPLETED LADY OF THE LAKE.

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:45.897
MERCHANT OF VENICE PLUTARCH'S

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:48.066
LIVES. ARITHMETIC INCLUDING THE

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.001
METRIC SYSTEM BUT NOT

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:51.336
NECESSARILY PROFIT LOSS IN

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.871
TAXES. QUADRATIC EQUATIONS BUT

00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:54.706
NOT THE MEASUREMENT OF A

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:57.008
CIRCLE. GEOGRAPHY AT LEAST AS

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.710
IT'S USED IN THE FIRST GRADE.

00:32:58.776 --> 00:32:59.977
LOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT LOTS AND

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:01.612
LOTS OF LATIN. PHYSICS BUT ONLY

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:04.382
TALKS VERY MENTALLY L. ALONG

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:05.283
WITH CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.118
TRIGONOMETRY PHYSIOLOGY OR IF

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:08.986
NONE OF THOSE FREE DRAWING. SO

00:33:09.053 --> 00:33:09.854
THE LEGISLATURE AT THE

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.055
UNIVERSITY FROM THE VERY

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.523
BEGINNING HAS BEEN VERY

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.425
INVOLVED IN DETERMINING. THE

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:17.128
CURRICULUM A NOT JUST OF THE

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:19.030
SCHOOLS BUT OF THE CLASSES

00:33:19.097 --> 00:33:20.965
THEMSELVES OF DATING BACK TO

00:33:21.032 --> 00:33:22.133
THE TURN OF THE- TWENTIETH

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.369
CENTURY. BUT I'M AND CONTINUED

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:24.969
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME IN THE

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:25.436
NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:26.871
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BEGAN

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:28.473
WHAT WHAT WAS THE EIGHT AFTER

CORMAN'S AND STATE AS A TO F.

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:31.809
FOR DECADES AND DECADES AND

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.910
DECADES UNTIL BECOMING A TO G.

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:33.778
AT THE LATTER PART OF THE LAST

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:35.913
CENTURY. AND THOSE EIGHT EVER

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.781
COURTS HAVE LARGELY STAYED THE

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.483
SAME FROM THAT FROM THAT

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.652
PERIOD. AND ALTHOUGH. WE MAY

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:42.420
NOT THINK ABOUT THE OF THE

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:44.689
LEVEL OF RIGOR OF SCIENCE IN

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:45.757
EVANS BACK THAT THERE WERE

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.058
QUITE A FEW DISSERTATIONS AND

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:48.426
STUDIES DONE BY THE-

ACADEMIC SENATE AND- KILLER AT

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:56.734
THE TIME. OF THE RELATIVE.

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:57.468
VALUE OF SUCH COURSES FIRST.

00:33:57.535 --> 00:34:03.007
AID VERSUS OTHER WAYS OF.

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.909
ADMISSION OTHER WERE NO TESTS.

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:05.443
STANDARDIZED TESTS AT THAT

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:05.977
POINT THOSE WERE TO COME

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:06.477
RELATIVELY SOON. BUT THE

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:07.078
SUBJECT MATTER COURSES CAME

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:07.578
ABOUT SHORTLY AFTER THE

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:08.079
ACADEMIC SENATE BECAME

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:08.613
RECOGNIZED AS THE PRIMARY

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.180
SOURCE OF GOVERNANCE AROUND

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:09.781
ADMISSIONS. NOW TODAY WE TAKE

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:10.415
THAT LARGELY FOR GRANTED BUT IN

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.783
IT WAS A NIGHT IT WAS IN THE

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:12.450
NINETEEN TWENTIES BUT

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:13.684
SPECIFICALLY IN ABOUT NINETEEN

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.952
TWENTY. THAT THE BERKELEY

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.788
REVOLUTION CREATED WHAT TODAY

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.855
IS OUR MODEL OF ECONOMIC SHARED

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:19.757
GOVERNANCE IN CALIFORNIA. IN

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.259
EDUCATION POLICY IN ADMISSIONS

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.860
WERE SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:23.895
THE UNIVERSITY TO THE YOUR

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:25.430
ACCOUNT FOR HIS ACADEMIC SENATE

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:26.798
AT THAT PERIOD. ABOUT THAT TIME

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.166
IS WHEN THE CSU STARTED TO

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:29.901
CONGEAL AS A STATE COLLEGES

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.769
UNDER THE STATE BOARD. AS WELL

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:32.804
BUT DID NOT HAVE THE SAME

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.439
STRUCTURE BACK IN OF ACADEMIC

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:35.440
OF SHARED GOVERNANCE AT THAT AT

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:37.408
THAT POINT. AND THROUGH THAT

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.410
PERIOD. BOTH THE CONSTITUTION

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.812
OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.079
ALL OF THE STATUTES THAT SET UP

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.781
SEE IT'S OF THE STATE COLLEGES

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:45.750
ALL WERE INSISTENT THAT THERE

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:46.484
SHALL BE NO POLITICAL OR

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:49.220
SECTARIAN INFLUENCE. ON THE TO

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.188
CALIFORNIA OR THE CALIFORNIA

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.189
STATE UNIVERSITY THE LANGUAGE

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.523
IS MOSTLY THE SAME IT'S JUST

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.591
UC'S LANGUAGES IN THE

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.326
CONSTITUTION. BUT THE NOTION

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:57.595
AROUND AUTONOMY OF THE SYSTEMS

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:58.763
AND THE THEY'RE SETTING OF

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.531
ACADEMIC MATTERS IN ADMISSIONS

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:01.833
WAS LARGELY DELEGATED EVEN AT

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.234
THAT STAGE TO THE TO THE

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:05.136
INSTITUTIONS. I'M THEMSELVES

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.070
AND THEN BEGINNING IN THE

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:06.604
NINETEEN TWENTIES TO THE

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.506
ACADEMIC SENATE. BY THE TIME

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.274
THAT THE MASTER PLAN CAME

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:12.210
AROUND. THAT SYSTEM WAS

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.511
STARTING TO BURST SCHOOLS WERE

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.546
SAYING IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THE

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.881
UNIVERSITY TO BE ACCREDITING US

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:17.982
WE DO OTHER THINGS AND JUST

00:35:18.049 --> 00:35:19.817
SENSE OF FOLKS UP TO COLLEGE.

00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:21.853
WATCH ACCREDITATION WAS CREATED

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:22.920
ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.589
MASTER PLAN ITSELF I'M IN THE

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.456
EARLY PART OF THE NINETEEN

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:26.324
SIXTIES OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.526
THEMSELVES WITH A CREDIT EACH

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:29.760
OTHER. AS OPPOSED TO THE TO THE

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:31.662
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.097
OTHERS ARE SAYING IF YOU FINISH

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.432
A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE A HIGH

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:35.433
SCHOOL DIPLOMA CALIFORNIA

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.335
SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO GOON TO

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.536
THE UNIVERSITY. AS A PET JUST

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.705
AS A MATTER OF POLICY. SO THE

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.607
MASTER PLAN CAME ABOUT IN THE

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.242
QUIRK OF HISTORY AS IT HAD CAME

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:45.943
ABOUT RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.211
TIDAL WAVE. AND SO OF THE

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.579
FOUNDING DOCUMENTS ESSENTIALLY

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:49.113
OF THE KEEP POLICIES IT'LL

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.915
DRIVE ADMISSIONS TODAY WERE SET

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:55.887
UP IN A PERIOD OF IMMENSE.

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:56.454
GROWTH AND A HIGH DEGREE OF

00:35:56.521 --> 00:36:01.659
PROJECT. SCARCITY RIGHT SO IT'S

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.260
IMPORTANT JUST REMEMBER THAT

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:02.894
THOSE CONDITIONS ARE WHAT WHAT

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.461
FRAME EVERYTHING. THAT HAS

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.061
HAPPENED SINCE THAT TIME. SO

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:05.162
THE MASTER PLAN. SET THE

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:05.930
ELIGIBILITY POOLS OF ONE THIRD

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:06.531
FOR CSU AND TWELVE AND A HALF

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:07.098
PERCENT OR ONE EIGHT FOR THE

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:08.032
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:10.535
WERE REDUCTIONS FROM THE FROM

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:12.503
THE POOLS FROM WHICH THE IN THE

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.471
TWO UNIVERSITIES WERE ADMITTING

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:14.805
STUDENTS PRIOR TO THE MASTER

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:15.973
PLAN. SO THE MASTER PLAN THAT

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.375
TODAY WE LARGELY CELEBRATE AS

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.043
A- THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS GRAND

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.478
GLOBAL A STEP FORWARD FOR

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:22.413
ACCESS AND EXCELLENCE. ITS

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.282
PRINCIPAL FEATURE WAS TO REDUCE

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.716
ACCESS TO THE TO PUBLIC

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:26.984
UNIVERSITIES IN IN THE CREATION

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:28.319
OF THE COMMITTEE CALLED SYSTEM

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.154
SO. CSU ELIGIBILITY WAS ABOUT

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:32.523
FORTY PERCENT. AT THAT 45% AT

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:33.457
THAT TIME AND YOU SEE

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:34.959
ELIGIBILITY WAS A FIFTEEN IN

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:35.927
THE MASTER PLAN TURN THOSE

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.762
NUMBERS DOWN AND SAID. BECAUSE

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.330
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE AND BECAUSE

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.332
WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:42.466
OR THE ELITE NATURE OF THESE

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:43.701
INSTITUTIONS DEPENDING ON YOUR

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:46.003
POINT OF VIEW. WE'RE GOING TO

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:46.971
RE DIRECT STUDENTS TO THE

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.773
COMMITTEE COLLEGES WITH THE

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.374
IRON CLAD PROMISE IN THE MASTER

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:50.875
PLAN THAT THERE WILL BE.

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:52.743
SEAMLESS EASY SIMPLE TRANSFER

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:53.878
SYSTEM. THAT WILL MAKE IT AS

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.379
THOUGH NOBODY IS A AS A WE

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:57.148
CHANGE NOTHING IT'S SIMPLY THAT

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.616
WILL BE A- MORE COST EFFECTIVE

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.718
INSTITUTION. SO THAT WAS THE

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.853
PROMISE. OF THE MASTER PLAN AND

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.989
THESE ELIGIBILITY INDEXES. TO

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:05.590
KEEP THINGS TO REMEMBER FROM

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:06.757
THE MASTER PLAN THAT ONE IT

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:07.825
NONE OF THIS WAS WRITTEN IN THE

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.226
STATUTE. EVERYTHING OF MOST

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:10.828
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE IN THE

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.630
MASTER PLAN IS IN THE STATE LAW

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:14.532
IT WAS CONTAINED IN THE DOT AND

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.399
DOT AND THE DON HOW ACT ENACTED

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:17.335
BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GREAT

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:20.838
ACCLAIM. BUT REALLY SOME WAYS

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:21.372
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:23.507
FEATURES OF MASTER PLAN WAS

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:27.111
NEVER CAUGHT UP. NOT ACCIDENT

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:28.746
THE LEGISLATORS HAD MANY MANY

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:34.251
DANCERS AND- SEVERAL REVIEWS OF

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:39.957
THEM. TO PLAN AND- IT EVER.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:40.791
PARTICULARLY IN CANADA I'M

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:44.362

PRESS AND SALAS IN. TWO

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:50.201
THOUSAND AND TWO PLAN BY STE.

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.403
FROM THAT POOL. IT'S ONLY BEEN

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.871
A CULTURAL CHANGE SINCE THAT

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.940
TIME THAT WEEK WE INTERPRET NOW

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:56.941
IT'LL ELIGIBILITY MEAN YOU'RE

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:59.343
GUARANTEED. NOT LEGALLY BUT

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.277
YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.746
GO TO THESE INSTITUTIONS IF YOU

ARE IN THE TOP ONE THIRD IN THE

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.849
TOP ONE EIGHT THAT WASN'T A

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:05.983
FEATURE OF THE ORIGINAL MASTER

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.318
PLAN. A MATCH BUT WAS ALSO

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:08.686
BEING CONSTRUCTED AT ABOUT THE

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:09.854
TIME THAT THE STANDARDIZED TEST

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.522
MOVEMENT WAS HAPPENING ACROSS

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:14.692
THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:16.327
BOTH THE YOU SEE AND THE

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:18.229
CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGES WERE

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:19.163
LARGELY REJECTING THE TEST

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.298
APPROACH THEY BOTH BELIEVED

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:23.968
THAT THEIR COURSE REQUIREMENTS

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.036
FOR YOU SEE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:26.904
THIS EIGHT F. EIGHT A. G.

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:27.505
COURSE SEQUENCE THAT YOU'RE

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:28.973
STILL TALKING ABOUT TODAY. FOR

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.840
CSU WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:32.143
BUT CLOSE THEY BELIEVE THAT

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:32.610
THOSE WERE THAT THEIR

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.211
REQUIREMENTS AND GRADES FROM

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.446
HIGH SCHOOL WHERE A NOT FOR AND

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:37.281
THAT THEY WERE CORRELATED. A

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.016
WHAT THEY CORRELATED WELL WITH

00:38:39.083 --> 00:38:39.583
STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN THE

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.619
FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARS.

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.387
BUT THE TENSION AND BECAME HOW

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.922
DO YOU ACHIEVE THESE REDUCED

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.925
ELIGIBILITY POOLS AND THERE ARE

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.360
THREE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS TO

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:50.728
THAT A ONE OF WHICH SHE IS YOU.

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:51.696
KNOW MORE OF ONE COMBINATION OF

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:54.098
WHICH CSU INVENTED SO THE FIRST

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.834
IS THE IS THE TEST SCORE AND

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:59.236
THE GPA REQUIREMENT WHICH- WE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.604
NOW WE NOW IT'S TAKEN FOR

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:02.039
GRANTED THAT THAT'S AND IT'S AN

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:05.109
INDEX. TO FEED IN IN A GRADE

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:05.810
AND YOU'VE DONE YOUR GPA AND

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:07.144
YOUR FEET IN YOUR TEST SCORE

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:07.611
AND THE INDEX OF THAT

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.579
DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:11.282
YOU'RE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. THAT'S

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.918
NOT FROM THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:14.952
THE MATCH POINT IT SPECIFY HOW

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.787
ELIGIBILITY WAS TO BE.

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.122
CALCULATED BUT THAT CA

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.156
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:21.358
CREATED THAT INDEX ITSELF AND

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.193
YOU SEE FOLLOWED SHORTLY.

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:23.794
SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND THE

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:24.795
OTHER REQUIREMENTS SEPARATE

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.831
FROM THE INDEX IS THE COURSE

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:30.601
PAT REQUIRE THAT YOU MUST

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:31.168
COMPLETED THE WORD THAT THE

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:34.405
COURT SCHOOLS COURSE. AND THEN

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.940
WERE EIGHT EVAN TODAY. EIGHT A

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:37.007
G. AND THEY ARE INDEED.

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.476
DETERMINANTS OF ELIGIBLE SHE

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.511
BOTH OF THAT IN ORDER TO BE

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:42.313
ELIGIBLE. THE REASON WHY THIS

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:50.788
IS IMPORTANT. DO YOU THINK WHEN

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:58.796
I GET TO THE WRAP UP IS THAT.

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.998
INCREASING THE TEST SCORE

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.867
VERSES INCREASINGTHE GPA

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:04.401
REQUIREMENT SO IF YOU HAVE A-

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:05.002
JUST A NOTE SUPPORT BUT WE'LL

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.836
GET PRACTICE QUANTITATIVE

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.204
REASONING HERE. IF YOU HAVE TO

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.105
MEET IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.941
A 33% TARGET. AND YOU'RE

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.810
CURRENTLY AT THIRTY FOUR THIRTY

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.378
FIVE OR THIRTY EIGHT OR 40% IN

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.080
ORDER TO. REDUCE THAT THE THREE

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:16.981
TOOLS THAT WE HAVE HAD OUR TO

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:19.350
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COURSES.

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:20.818
INCREASE THE GPA REQUIRED OR

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:21.852
INCREASE THE TEST SCORE

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:24.922
REQUIRED. AND SO AT A IF THAT

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.490
EQUATION IS GOING TO STAY THE

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.192
SAME THEN YOU DON'T HAVE FOUR

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.960
DEGREES OF FREEDOM. YOU CANNOT

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:31.562
PICK AN ELIGIBILITY TARGET PLUS

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:33.030
A TEST SCORE TARGET PLAZA. GPA

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.431
TARGET PLUS OF COURSE START

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.299
EVEN SOMETHING HAS TO VERY BE

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:38.569
VARIABLE. AND SO THIS IS BEEN

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:40.437
THE CONSTANT DEBATE SINCE THE

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:41.572
NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND IN THE

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.840
STATE IS ONE OF THE REASONS

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:45.376
WHY. ABOUT THE- UC AND THEN AND

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:46.210
LATER ON SEE IF YOU JUST

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.077
DETERMINE TO MOVE WITH THE

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.412
SUBJECT COURSE PATTERN AT THE

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.181
WEIGHT IN THE WAY THAT IT IS.

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.949
IS THAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:52.783
UNIVERSITY MINISTRY. AND

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.218
LEGISLATORS ALL AGREED THAT IT

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.020
POLITICALLY EASIER TO DO THAT

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:58.022
THAN TO RACE THE TEST SCORE

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:58.889
REQUIREMENT OR THE GPA REPORT

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.758
OR THE GPA. CUT OFF SUPPORT.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:01.926
AND SO THAT THIS THIS THIS

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.327
TENSION BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.929
FORMS OF ELIGIBILITY WAS BAKED

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:06.630
INTO THAT PLAN. BUT REMEMBER

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.798
IT'S BASIC MAKING THAT PLAN

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:09.400
BECAUSE THE PLAN. A FIRM REALLY

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:10.901
WHICH WAS INTENDED WHICH HE OF

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.803
A REDUCTION IN TOTAL IN TOTAL

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.038
OUT AND TOTAL ACCESS TO THE TO

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:16.540
THE SYSTEM. NOW FROM THAT FROM

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:17.875
FROM THE POINT OF THE

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.743
ACCREDITATION BY THE

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.446
UNIVERSITY. THE TWO PUBLIC

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:27.852
UNIVERSITY. OF HIGH SCHOOLS THE

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:28.385
TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OF AT

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:33.657
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THE CARD

00:41:33.724 --> 00:41:34.325
LIMóN EXPECTATIONS OF THE CAKE

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.593
SYSTEM AND AT EACH POINT WHEN.

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.394
THE SUBJECT MATTER PATTERN WAS

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:37.962
CREATED. ALTHOUGH IT AT THAT

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:38.529
TIME IT WILL. WELCOME BY K.

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.296
TWELVE EDUCATION BECAUSE IT WAS

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.564
AT LEAST LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.065
LADY OF THE LAKE IN THE

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:41.665
MERCHANT OF VENICE AND NOT NOT

00:41:41.732 --> 00:41:42.299
TEACHING THE- CIRCUMFERENCE OF

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:42.800
THE CIRCLE. SO IT WAS A

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.001
RELAXATION OF THE OF THE- OF

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:44.969
THE HEAVY HANDED. CURRICULUM

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:45.502
AND INTERFERENCE OF THE

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:46.070
NIVERSITY AT THAT TIME. BUT

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:47.171
SINCE THAT POINT THAT THE

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.038
DEBATE HAS BEEN ABOUT ADDING

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:50.040
ADDITIONAL COURSES. AND ITS

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.909
IMPACT ON THE ON THE ABILITY OF

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:53.544
KATE WILL TO DELIVER. ON THE

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.145
ADVISABILITY OF WHETHER CABLE

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:56.814
SHOULD CHOOSE THAT PATTERN. AND

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.883
WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS CAN CAN

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:01.785
CAN COOK. COMPLETED AND- AND SO

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.120
THAT THIS HAS BEEN THAT THE

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.722
DEBATE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:05.689
EVERY TIME WHEN THE WHEN THE-

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:06.690
WHEN THE- UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.559
AND SEE IF. THE DOCTOR THE

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.094
ELIGIBILITY INDEX THAT CSU HAD

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.296
PIONEERED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:13.564
VASCONCELOS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:14.832
ASSEMBLY ONE TREATY HUGHES IS

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:18.302
THE CHAIR OF. THIS COMMITTEE.

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.638
HELD A LOT OF HEARINGS ON THAT

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:21.906
TOPIC SAYING THAT THE

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:22.539
ELIGIBILITY INDEX ITSELF THAT

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:24.541
COMBINATION. SCORES AND GPA WAS

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:27.144
GOING TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE.

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.346
ACCESS FOR UNDER REPRESENTED

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.916
STUDENTS. AT THAT TIME AND THEN

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:32.483
THEY HELP THE ANOTHER SET A

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.918
LEGISLATOR HELD AN EQUIVALENT

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:35.619
HEARING THE FOLLOWING DECADE

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:38.055
WHEN CSU TURN THOSE. MARMOTS

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:41.325
UP. AND K. TWELVE A AND YOU'LL

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.359
HEAR A LOT. OF DEBATE

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.961
IMPERFECTIONS IN. CASCADE WILD.

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:45.029
IN GENERAL I HAVE TO MOST OF

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:46.463
THE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH OVERTIME.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.532
AND SO HAVE STUDENTS A PART OF

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:49.300
THE PART OF THE POLICY QUESTION

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:51.035
THAT THAT YOU FACE IS. WHETHER

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:52.369
NOT THEY SHOULD. AND WHERE

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:53.203
THAT'S ADVISABLE. I THINK I

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.105
POINT OUT IT WHICH IS OFTEN

00:42:55.172 --> 00:42:55.673
LOST IN THIS DISCUSSION IS

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.373
THAT. IT HAS WORKED IN THE

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.177
REVERSE TO. SO WHEN THE WHEN

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.812
THE K. TWELVE SAYS WHEN KATE

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.113
TWELVE DETERMINE. THEIR IN THE

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.381
FORTHCOMING CORD DROPPED THE

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:05.316
DROP FOR THE ELEVENTH GRADE

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:08.686
ASSESSMENT. THE CS USE ABILITY

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:09.653
TO OFFER THE EARLY. DEMOCRATS

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.289
OUT. ALSO DISAPPEARED SORT OF

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.991
UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM. AT AT THE

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:23.701
LAST. MOMENT THE ADOPTION OF

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:24.335
THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:30.040
EXAM WHICH HAD. TAX EVASION

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:30.474
RATES ALSO AFFECTED

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.608
ELIGIBILITY. NOW WHY BECAUSE

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.943
WHEN YOU WHENEVER YOU WERE YOU

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:33.510
AFFECT THE GRADUATION RATE.

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:34.712
YOUR AFFECTING THE L. BECAUSE

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:35.379
THE ELDERLY RATE IS JUST IT IS

00:43:35.446 --> 00:43:36.013
A RATE. WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.647
ELIGIBILITY BEING ABOUT A GROUP

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.181
OF PEOPLE. WHICH IT IS OF

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.549
COURSE BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE

00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:39.350
NOMINATOR OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:39.950
GRADUATION RATE. IT'S OF THEIR

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:40.517
FEWER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.219
BECAUSE OF MORE PEOPLE CANNOT

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:42.987
GET TO THE DIPLOMA DUE TO THE-

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:45.689
HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM. A LARGER

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.358
SHARE OF THEM ARE LIKE ARE

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:48.926
GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR THE

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:49.960
ADOPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:51.261
EXIT EXAM WHICH WAS NOT A

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.963
COLLABORATION AMONG EDUCATION

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.764
VERY FEW THINGS EVER ARE

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.466
BETWEEN K. TWELVE HIGHER ED.

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:57.935
AFFECT DROVE UP THE ELIGIBILITY

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.069
RATE WHICH THEN FORCED YOU SEEN

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.404
SEATS YOU TO THINK ABOUT

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:01.739
WHETHER OR NOT. THEY NEED TO

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:02.506
INCREASE THEIR ADMISSION

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:03.173
STANDARDS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.641
THAT. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:05.709
OF THOSE DRAMATICALLY CUT

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:07.411
AFFECTED. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.345
IN THE ELIGIBILITY PULLS BUT IT

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:09.613
IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.949
BETWEEN. THE SIZE OF THE POOL

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.250
AND THE RATE THE NUMBER THAT IT

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:16.353
IS RELATIVE TO THAT. 33% THAT

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.621
IS IN THAT IS IN THE MASTER

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:20.124
PLAN. SO THAT THAT THAT THAT'S

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.859
COME BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:23.227
BETWEEN THIS AND EVEN THE H. AG

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:24.995
FOR ALL MOVEMENT. ON THAT

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:26.330
THAT'S WHAT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:29.199
THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. HAS

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:29.800
THAT SAME EFFECT TO THE EXTENT

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.302
THAT EVERY STUDENT IN SAN JOSE.

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.638
OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.708
IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETE. A TO

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:39.276
G. CORRECT I'M FOR YOU TO SEE

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.078
AN FOR CSU. THAT IF EVERYONE

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.347
DOES AT THE GRADUATE THEN

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:47.084
BECOMES NO LONGER A SORT

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:53.424
MACINNES. FOR L. ELIGIBLE.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.926
DETERMINAR GREAT I BY. A AND

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.694
SCORES. SO I BET BYE BACK NOT

00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:58.228
GIVING YOU ANY ANSWER. TO

00:44:58.295 --> 00:44:58.829
SIMPLY TO POINT OUT THIS THIS

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.763
FUNDAMENTAL TENSION THAT EXISTS

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.764
ON TWO LEVELS ONE IS BETWEEN.

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:03.333
BETWEEN GPA TEST SCORES AND THE

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:03.934
SUBJECT PATTERN AND THE SECOND

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.135
IS THE TENSION BETWEEN. ACCESS

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.303
AND THE ELIGIBILITY THE IDEA OF

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:07.471
THE ELIGIBILITY POOLS AS A

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.072
STATE POLICY UNCODIFIED STATE

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.273
POLICY REDUCES THE TOTAL AMOUNT

00:45:09.339 --> 00:45:10.274
OF ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.508
SAID THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.444
IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNANCE

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.679
ISSUES HAVE ALSO CHANGED SO IN

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.381
THE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:18.182
DURING THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.483
IT WAS THE TWO ACADEMIC

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.517
SENATE'S OF THE INSTRUCTIONS

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.785
THAT STILL HAD PRIMACY OVER

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.787
ADMISSIONS POLICY. THAT'S ONE

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:24.388
OF THE REASONS WHY THE

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:25.589
ELIGIBILITY POLLS WERE NOT PUT

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.658
INTO STATUTE WAS THERE WAS A

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.093
RECOGNITION BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:32.429
AND BY. THE BOARDS OF THE

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:33.030
REGIONS IN THE TRUSTEES THAT

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.665
THAT THAT EL ADMISSIONS WHAT'S

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.200
FUNDAMENTALLY AN ACADEMIC

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.468
POLICY MATTER AND THEREFORE

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:41.038
SHOULD BE IS A SHOULD BE

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:41.672
PROTECTED AGAINST INTERFERENCE

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:44.775
BY. THE BY THE PLEASURE IN THE

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.543
IN THE SEVENTIES HOWEVER AS

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.145
MORE CAMPUS IT BECAME IMPACTED

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.546
ACADEMIC SENATE'S COULD NO

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:50.814
LONGER CONDUCT ALL OF

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.683
ADMISSIONS POLICY PRACTICE BY

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:54.351
THEMSELVES. AND SO DID THE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:56.386
DELEGATION OF DECISIONS ABOUT

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:57.454
WHO TO SELECT FROM THE

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:58.388
ELIGIBILITY POOL AT BERKELEY OR

00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.357
UCLA OR AT SAN DIEGO STATE

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.326
BEGAN TO BE DELEGATED FROM. THE

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:04.194
ACADEMIC SENATE STATEWIDE DOWN

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.863
TWO CAMPUSES AND THE ROLE OF

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.330
THE ADMINISTRATION IN

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.698
ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.200
IMPLEMENTATION STARTED TO RISE

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:12.236
AND SO THAT TODAY IT'S A MIX OF

00:46:12.302 --> 00:46:13.737
BOTH THE SENATE'S PLAY A

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.039
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN. THE IN THE

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.608
BROAD POLICY OF ADMISSIONS BUT

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:18.642
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:21.145
ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE IN IN IN IN

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.113
IN IN IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.415
AND THE CHOICES THAT ARE MADE.

00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:26.416
THE SECOND THING THAT OCCURRED

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:27.317
TO THE SECOND AB PATTERN THAT

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:29.019
OCCURRED WAS IN THE SEVENTIES

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:31.221
AND EIGHTIES A STRONG EFFORT BY

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.724
MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURE TO IT TO

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.125
ENCOURAGE DIVERSIFICATION OF

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:37.194
THE MISSIONS POOL. THAT WAS AN

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:37.895
ISSUE IN NINETEEN IN THE

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.596
SIXTIES BUT BUT RELATIVELY

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:40.898
RELATIVELY MODEST IN THE

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:42.332
SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES IT

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:43.167
BECAME A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THE

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.802
LEGISLATURE PASSED. A

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:47.171
CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS AND ONE

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:49.806
STATUTE SORT OF ESTABLISHING

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:50.440
THAT IT WAS THE GOAL THAT THIS

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:52.776
THAT THE TWO UNIVERSITIES

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:55.212
SHOULD STRIVE TO APPROXIMATE A

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:57.514
REFLECT ON THE POPULATION OF

00:46:57.581 --> 00:46:58.081
CALIFORNIA POPULATION HIGH

00:46:58.148 --> 00:47:02.352
SCHOOL GRADUATES. IT AT

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:02.953
DIFFERENT TIMES THEY THEY DID

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:09.426
NOT CHOOSE. TO PASS A LAW

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:09.993
MANDATING A SPECIFIC SET OF

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:10.594
ADMISSIONS POLICIES BUT THEY

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.528
SAID. THAT AS A AS AN IMPORTANT

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.029
WAS THE FIRST TIME THE

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:12.663
LEGISLATURE HAD SERIOUSLY BEEN

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.298
INVOLVED IN ADMISSIONS POLICY.

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:14.932
IN QUITE A LONG TIME AND THEN

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:15.532
MORE PERHAPS MORE NOTORIOUSLY

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:16.633
AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.335
WHEN. IF THE REGION'S A

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:19.670
PARTICULAR SB ONE THE READ WHEN

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:20.737
THE REGION'S ADOPTED THEIR

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:22.139
POLICY TO ESSENTIALLY TO REVOKE

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.540
ALL OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:25.742
POLICIES. IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:26.643
BY THE GOV BY GOVERNOR WILSON

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.711
AT THAT TIME ESSENTIALLY

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:29.947
ORDERING HIGHER EDUCATION TO

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.582
STOP USING RACE AS A FACTOR IN

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.117
ADMISSIONS. CAUSED OTHER TO BE

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.185
BOTH SIGNIFICAN ABOUT PUT WHAT

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:36.353
WHAT THE CONSTRUCTION MIKE

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.354
CONTEMPLATED POLITICAL

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.489
INTERFERENCE IN EMISSIONS BUT

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:40.757
ALSO A LOT OF PUSH BACK ABOUT

00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:41.358
THAT IT THAT THAT QUESTION AS

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.126
WELLSO. THE LESSON AROUND GOOD

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:44.728
GOVERNANCE IS THAT THE ECONOMIC

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:45.929
SENATE'S AND FACULTY OF

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.297
TRADITIONALLY HAD THAT RESPOND

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.665
TO BE THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO.

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:50.500
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ON ALL

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.502
SIDES OF THIS OF THIS QUESTION

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:53.070
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. SOME

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.738
ABRASIONS AROUND THE EDGES SO

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.073
IF. I COULD JUST LEAVE IT THAT

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.174
THAT THAT THAT THINK THINK

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:59.610
THINK THE TO KEEP POLICY

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.177
QUESTIONS I THINK THAT THAT

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.445
THAT OUR THAT OUR HEAD OF YOU

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.580
BRIT LARGE AGAIN I'M I'M NOT AN

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:04.648
EXPERT ON THAT YOUR ISSUE AT

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:07.484
ALL. ONE IS THERE THE ROLE OF

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:10.354
THE UNIVERSITIES IN. THE

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.089
GUIDANCE OF K. TWELVE UP BOTH

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.690
DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS BUT ALSO

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:14.791
STUDENTS AND EXPERIENCES IN THE

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:15.792
CHOICES THAT THEY ARE MAKING IN

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:17.294
K. TWELVE. AND THE THERE THE

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.997
RECORD IS. IS NEXT AND POSITIVE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:20.864
AND NEGATIVE ALL THE WAY

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.065
THROUGH HISTORY BUT THERE'S BUT

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:23.900
THIS IS A POLICY CHOICE FOR THE

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.035
LEGISLATURE TO BE CONSIDERING.

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:27.371
AND THE SECOND IS. IS THE ARE

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:28.372
THE ELIGIBILITY PULLS

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:31.208
THEMSELVES AND- WE HAVE AS WITH

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.676
WE'VE TAKEN AS THE AS THE

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.211
GOSPEL BUT NOT GOSPEL ENOUGH TO

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:36.480
WRITE THE STATUTE. THAT NO

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:38.348
MATTER WHAT WE WILL ALWAYS BE

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.617
SETTING THE POOL OF BY A YOUNG

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:41.852
BE OF YOUNG PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:42.953
THAT CAN GOING TO THE TO

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.856
UNIVERSITIES BASED ON. A FIXED

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:47.024
PROPORTION OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:47.624
GRADUATES NO MATTER HOW WELL

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:50.127
PREPARED THEY ARE. NO NO MATTER

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:51.595
HOW MUCH MORE ADVANCED THEY

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:52.729
MIGHT BE FROM A GENERATION AGO

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.197
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THIS

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.533
FIXED LIMITATION FROM THE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.134
TWELVE AND HAVE IN THE THIRD.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.402
BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES

00:48:58.468 --> 00:49:04.608
TREES USE KERRY. LEGISLATION TO

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.175
CHANGE THE TWELVE AND A HALF

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:11.181
215% AND. 33% OF THE TO THIRTY

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:11.982
FIVE. THE LEGISLATURE IS DOLLY

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:12.783
WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE BUT THE

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:13.350
COST IMPLICATIONS ARE NOT.

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:13.884
TRIVIAL EITHER AND SO. THE

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:14.951
POLICY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:15.952
REALLY IS. THAT FUNDAMENTAL IS

00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:16.586
ONE OF THEM IS THIS FUNDAMENTAL

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:17.187
QUESTION ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:17.754
POOLS BECAUSE WE DON'T DEAL

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:18.288
WITH THEM. THEN YOU WILL

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:18.855
CONSTANTLY DEALING WITH WELL

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.489
WHAT ARE THE RATIONING

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:20.123
MECHANISMS WHAT ARE THE SORTING

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.625
MECHANISMS IF IT'S NOT SUBJECT

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.635
COLLEGE DEGREE. DOCTOR GO BALD

00:50:05.702 --> 00:50:06.903
AND DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.272
ROOM AND CSU TO ACCEPT MORE

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:11.742
STUDENTS. AND IF SO IS THERE A

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:13.977
WAY THAT WE CAN CREATIVELY

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.213
UPDATE THE MASTER PLAN TO

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.214
CHANGE THE NEEDS FOR THIS

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.449
CENTURY AND THE DIVERSE

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:20.050
POPULATION OF STUDENTS WE NOW

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:23.387
HAVE. THE ADDICT WHAT WHAT WE

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:24.321
WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:25.155
NATIONAL IMPAIRED AND SENSES

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:27.391
THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE SCALABLE

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.326
I'M AT THE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:31.261
INTO THE WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:33.163
CREATE MORE SAN DIEGO STATES IN

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.997
UCLA'S STRESSED OUT OF WITH THE

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.365
SNAP OF FINGERS IS A- THAT'S A

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.333
DIFFERENT QUESTION. BUT IN

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.334
TERMS OF THE ELIGIBLE IT'S

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.436
SERVING THE ELIGIBLE GRADUATES

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.238
IN CALIFORNIA IN SOME WAY THE

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:42.439
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS THE

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.241
STATE AND THE SYSTEMS HAVE HAVE

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:45.409
PROVEN THAT THEY CAN'T SCALE.

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:48.011
AND IN THE IN THE TIDAL WAVE TO

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.813
WHEN THAT WAS APPROACHING AND

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.947
THE LEGISLATURE'S GRAPPLING

00:50:51.014 --> 00:50:52.549
WITH EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUES AS

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:53.683
I SAID CENTER ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.818
HUGHES DID CARRY LEGISLATION TO

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.486
EXPAND ELIGIBILITY POLLS AND AT

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:57.854
THAT TIME BOTH THE UNIVERSITY

00:50:57.921 --> 00:50:59.089
CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA.

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:00.290
STATE UNIVERSITY CAME FORWARD

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:02.159
WITH WITH BURKE WITH PLANS TO

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.560
CONSTRUCT MANY MORE CAMPUSES

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.729
YOU SEE THREE AT ONCE IN THE IN

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:06.897
THE NINETEEN NINETIES NOT THAT

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.031
ALL RIGHT GOT REDUCED AND

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.367
MERCED. BUT THE POINT IS THAT

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:12.035
THE POLICY CONVERSATION

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.069
WHIZZING WAS FULLY ENGAGED

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.971
BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENT AND

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.773
THE TO UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ABOUT

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.742
THEIR ABILITY TO SCALE TO THINK

00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:20.143
ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.579
THE MAGIC ARBITRARINESS OF THE

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:26.950
OF. THE OF THE 33% ELIGIBILITY.

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:31.188
FOR NINETEEN SIXTY. AND ONE

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:31.788
MORE QUESTION I WAS A HISTORY

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:32.355
TEACHER. AT THE AT THE HIGH

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.391
SCHOOL. AND AS I LOOK AT UNITED

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:35.692
STATES HISTORY. AS IT PERTAINS

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:40.697
TO THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN THE IN

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.599
THE UNITED STATES IT HAS BEEN A

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:45.902
MOVEMENT FROM VERY LIMITED. TO

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.838
EXPAND IN THE RIGHT TO VOTE

00:51:47.904 --> 00:51:49.773
RIGHT GOING FROM JUST PROPERTY

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.242
OWNERS WHITE PROPERTY MAIL

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:55.111
OWNERS OF PROPERTY. RIGHT TO

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.614
GIVING AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.016
WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:03.019
EXPANDING THAT RIGHT I HAVE

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.622
SEEN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.524
UNITED STATES THE SAME KIND OF

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:10.627
TRAJECTORY. IN WHO DO WE THINK

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:11.194
WOULD BENEFIT FROM GOING TO

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:14.397
COLLEGE. RIGHT WHEN COLLEGES

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:16.833
WERE FIRST CREATED. WE HAD YOU

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.736
KNOW HARVARD IN THE IVY LEAGUE

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.372
IN PRINCETON WHERE IT WAS.

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:25.108
BASICALLY WEALTHY MAN WHAT THE

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.244
AGAIN WEALTHY WHITE MEN GOING

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.145
TO COLLEGE WE'VE EXPANDED THAT

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.581
AND WE'VE DONE THAT

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:32.048
HISTORICALLY. THE SAME

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:35.952
PROJECTOR. EXCEPT FOR THE YOU

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:37.320
KNOW MAYBE THAT THAT AS YOU

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.922
POINTED OUT THAT TIME IN

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.423
CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WHERE WE

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.527
WENT BACK ON DIVERSITY WITH THE

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:46.129
BACCHAE DECISION AND PROP TWO

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:46.730
OH NINE. IT'S BEEN A MOVEMENT

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:49.766
THAT DIRECTION. WOULD YOU LIKE

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.568
TO WAY AND COULD YOU WEIGH IN

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:53.803
ON WHAT YOU THINK THIS A

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.039
PROPOSAL BY CSU WHICH WAY DOES

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:59.843
THAT MOVES. NO I DEFINITELY

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.280
WOULD NOT LIKE TO WAIT. WAIT

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:04.414
WAIT WAIT IN ON ON ON THAT

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.782
POINT BUT IF YOU YOU KNOW I

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:06.816
MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK THAT

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.852
IF EVERYONE IN SAN JOSE OR LA

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.053
OR THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.288
ADOPTED A TO G. FOR ALL IF

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.923
EVERYONE COMPLETES A TO G. AND

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:15.592
GRADUATES AND ACHIEVE THAT GPA.

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:18.094
AND TEST SCORE STAYED THE SAME

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:20.363
THEN WHAT IS THE POLICY BASIS

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.798
FOR SAYING THAT I'D SMALLER

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:23.567
PERCENTAGE OF THEM SHOULD NOT

00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:24.534
BE GOING ON TO UNIVERSITY I

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.603
THINK THAT'S THAT IN OTHER THAN

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.372
THE PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OF

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:30.140
NINETEEN FIFTY NINE IN NINETEEN

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:30.707
SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA TERMS OF

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.709
TAXATION AND- THE WAR AND

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.077
EVERYTHING ELSE WHAT OTHER

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:35.712
REASON IS THERE. OF FOR DOING

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:36.346
THAT SO IT I THINK IN SOME SUCH

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:38.548
AS IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:39.950
YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN THAT IN

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:40.917
THAT STUDENTS HAVE BEEN

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.452
STUDENTS FROM THE FROM THESE

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:44.254
VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS IN PLACES

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:44.788
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:47.357
ACHIEVING AT LEVELS THAT. ARE

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:49.159
TWENTY OR THIRTY OR FORTY OR

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:50.560
SIXTY YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:52.495
SEEN AS NICK NICK YOU KNOW NEAR

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:54.431
GENIUS ACHIEVEMENTS THE LEVEL

00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:55.165
OF BOTH SUBJECT MATTER

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:57.634
COMPLETION GRADES AND TEST

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.868
SCORES. AND YET WE HAVE

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.570
PRODUCED IN WITH KEPT UP WE'VE

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:01.538
ARTIFICER MARK ARBITRARILY KEPT

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:06.443
DOWN THE TOTAL NUMBER SO WHAT.

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.010
YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WHILE

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:10.981
ACHIEVEMENT HAS GONE UP. THE

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:11.848
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.249
ELIGIBLE AS REMAIN SOMEWHAT

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:14.184
CONSTANT. YES THAT BUT BY

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.118
DEFINITION IT'S IF YOU IF YOU

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:16.720
LOOK AT THE AT AND I'M I'M

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:17.654
SORRY I DON'T HAVE A WHITE

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.222
BOARD BUT- I MEAN IF YOU LOOK

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.290
AT THAT AND MA'AM I'M SURE

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.024
SOMEBODY ELSE BY THE TESTIMONY

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.425
LATER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:23.526
TRAJECTORY OF STUDENT

00:54:23.593 --> 00:54:25.996
ELIGIBILITY OVERTIME. WELL I

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.697
MEAN WHAT YOU SEE IS THERE IS A

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:28.965
RISE AS STUDENT AT SCHOOLS AND

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.467
STUDENTS ACHIEVE. HIGHER AND

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:33.203
HIGHER LEVELS OF EXPECTATIONS.

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.471
SCORES GRADES AND COURSE

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:36.673
COMPLETIONS. RISING AND GETS

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:39.209
ABOVE 33% OF THE THIRTY FIVE IS

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:40.276
A THIRTY SIX. AND THEN OF

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.378
POLICY THAN A SOMETHING CHANGES

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:43.046
EITHER THE INDEX GOES UP TEST

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.714
SCORES AND GPA OR OF COURSE

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:46.483
GETS OR OR TWO OR THREE GETS

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.551
ADDED. AND IT IMPLEMENTS. AND

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.820
IT'S OUR STRIDES BACK AGAIN.

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.956
AND THEN IT HAS TO BE KEPT

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.591
UNDER CONTROL THAT IMPLEMENTS

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:55.558
AGAIN IT'S A THIS IS THE STORY

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.161
OF. OF ADMISSIONS. IN SOME

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.663
SENSE IT'S A ADDS THAT HAPPENED

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:00.897
A BOTH UC AND CSU BUT IT'S A

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.633
STARKER PICTURE AT CSU. BECAUSE

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.001
WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:06.936
THAT STUDENTS. STERN TO SCHOOLS

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.438
HAVE DONE HAVE HAVE RESPONDED

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:09.906
BETTER TO SEE IF YOU. THAT THAT

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.007
THEIR LEVEL THEIR RATES OF

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.009
IMPROVEMENT. IN IN A TREATMENT

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.277
ALONG WITH MANY OF THESE

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:15.445
INDICATORS HAVE BEEN BETTER

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.180
THAN YOU SEE AND SO. SEE IF YOU

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.782
EVERY TIME THEY'VE MADE ONE OF

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:20.250
THESE CHANGES STUDENTS HAVE.

00:55:20.316 --> 00:55:21.584
FIRST DECLINE IN THE REBOUND

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.520
AND GOD EVEN FARTHER WHERE'S

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.454
THE UC LINE IS MUCH MORE SMOOTH

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:27.223
WITH OTHER OVERTIME. YEAH THERE

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.857
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:29.592
IN IN IN IN ACHIEVEMENT MARRIED

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:30.827
WITH CHANGING THE DEMOGRAPHY OF

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.796
CALIFORNIA. THAT TOGETHER WOULD

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:35.265
HAVE PRODUCED A MUCH LOW IF YOU

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:38.902
SAID HERE'S THE STANDARD THE

00:55:38.968 --> 00:55:40.236
STANDARD OF ACADEMIC SUCCESS NO

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:42.205
PREPARATION. NINETY STATE THAT.

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.740
TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN MANY MANY

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:44.774
MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:46.443
STUDENTS WHO WOULD BE WHO WOULD

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:54.751
MEET THAT STANDARD. BUT. NOT

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:55.385
ELIGIBLE BE IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL.

00:55:55.452 --> 00:56:02.692
IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL REYES. YEAH

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:03.660
I KNOW CAN GO FOR THIS FOR. A

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:04.194
COUPLE HOURS THAT BUT I'M

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.794
INTEREST THE NEXT POINT BUT I

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:05.962
GUESS THIS REALLY IS THE KEY

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.030
QUESTION IS THAT. IS POINT.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:07.630
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.832
AWAY TO RATION ACCESS. OR IS IT

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:09.799
REALLY. A TOOL TO HELP THE

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:10.567
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO CSU.

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:11.768
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. HAVE A

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:12.969
REALIZATION WITH THE ECONOMIC

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.170
NEEDS OF OUR GRADUATES BUT HE

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:15.371
HAS NOT LOST UPON YOU THAT THAT

00:56:15.438 --> 00:56:16.506
REPORT THAT I THINK SEE IF THEY

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:19.442
GIVE US A COUPLE. YEARS AGO

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.043
TALKING ABOUT. AT A TIME WHEN

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.612
THE UNIVERSITY IN OUR- STUDENTS

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.481
ARE ARE THE MOST DIVERSE EVER

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.282
IS THIS TIME WORST SCHOOL IS.

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.417
YOU KNOW THE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:29.285
THAN EVER. IT'S MORE MORE

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.521
DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:34.224
UNIVERSITY SETTING. BUT BUT I

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.358
THINK THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:38.027
THE DEGREE. GAP WHERE WE NEED

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:39.262
MORE MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.231
AND MORE AND MORE STUDENTS ARE

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.766
GRADUATING THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:44.300
WITH THEIR A TO G. REQUIREMENTS

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:47.036
IT IT IT TALKS ABOUT. YOU KNOW

00:56:47.103 --> 00:56:48.138
DO WE NEED TO RE LOOK AT OUR

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:51.007
THOSE 33% NUMBERS. ARBITRARY

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.041
AND I THINK THAT WHAT WHAT THIS

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:54.077
PROPOSAL SOME WOULD SAY IS THIS

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:56.179
JUST A WAY. TO MANAGE WITHIN

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.314
THE 33% RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.283
IF YOU HAD IF THE IF THE CAT IF

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.252
A WHAT IF WE IF WE WERE. HAD

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:04.120
MONEY TO ACCEPT ALL ELIGIBLE

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:05.488
STUDENTS AND HAD A POLICY THE

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:09.893
DICK THAT ACCEPTED. THE TOP 50%

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:10.460
WOULD BE REALLY BECOMING FOR

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:13.730
WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND I GUESS

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:16.966

YOU WANT TO FIND UPON THAT YEAH

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:19.369
I MEAN I THINK THAT THE END OF

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:20.737
IT THAT IS A PART OF THE

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:21.271
QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THE

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:21.905

HAVE COMPLETED OVER THE LAST

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.897
TWO YEARS WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:38.999
ELEVEN TEN. AND IT HAS MADE A

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.769
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:42.403
OF HOW STUDENTS ARE PROGRESSING

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:45.706
TOWARD THEIR DEGREE. HOWEVER IT

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:47.475
WAS NEVER CONCEIVED TO BE A

01:35:47.541 --> 01:35:49.944
LONG TERM COUNTER BALANCE FOR

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.979
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ARRIVE

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:55.049
INTO COLLEGE AND PREPARE. RIGHT

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:57.952
SOUL THE IDEA IS THAT. SO

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.386
THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:02.056
WOULD SAY EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:03.524
STUDENTS WHO ARRIVE FULLY

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.192
PREPARED AND THOSE WHO ARE NOW

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.560
GOING TO CALL REQUISITE

01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:08.129
COURSES. THERE ARE STILL PRETTY

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:11.465
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.501
THOSE STUDENTS THE IMPACTS ARE

01:36:13.567 --> 01:36:14.668
NOT AS HARSH FOR STUDENTS WHO

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.837
ARRIVE UNDER PREPARED TODAY AS

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.273
THEY WERE JUST A YEAR AGO BUT

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:19.840
THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENCES

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:22.276
BETWEEN THOSE STUDENTS WE WITH

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:23.911
SOME OF US HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:26.113
OF GOING TO COMMENCEMENT

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.681
CEREMONIES AND- AND WHEN YOU'RE

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:29.984
THERE AND THE SCIENCE. SCHOOL

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:31.685
OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

01:36:31.752 --> 01:36:33.120
STANDS UP. THERE PRETTY CLEAR

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.955
DESPAIR ISN'T AS OF WHO'S

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:37.424
GRADUATING WITH STEM DEGREES

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.059
AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAS ON

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.728
OUR OUR FUTURE WORK FORCE AND

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:41.729
THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC

01:36:41.795 --> 01:36:43.664
MOBILITY OF MANY STUDENTS. SO

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.232
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT BUT

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.201
BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE HALF OF THE

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:48.869
EQUATION THE SECOND HALF IS

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:50.538
THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A

01:36:50.604 --> 01:36:52.940
WAY TO ENCOURAGE AND TO INVITE

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:53.807
OUR STUDENTS TO BE BETTER

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:56.443
PREPARED UPON ARRIVAL. AND WHEN

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:57.711
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE

01:36:57.778 --> 01:37:00.014
HAVE PROVIDED FOR YOU STUDENTS

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.715
WHO ARRIVE WITH THREE YEARS OF

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.484
MATH OR QUANTITATIVE REASONING

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.352
COMPARE TO FOR IT'S PRETTY

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:07.388
CLEAR. NOT ONLY STE WHY

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:09.490
STUDENTS ASIAN STUDENTS AFRICAN

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:10.925
AMERICAN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:14.595
ACROSS THE BOARD. THE LEVEL OF

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:19.967
PREPARATION MATTERS. IF NEARLY

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:21.735
EVERY STUDENT IS ALREADY MEDIAN

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:23.370
THE REQUIREMENT AS STATED IN

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.272
THE DOCUMENTS FOR C. ISSUES

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:27.107
AUGUST HEARING HOW WOULD THE

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:29.143
PROPOSED POLICY CHANGE AND

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:31.912
IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. I

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.814
THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:35.015
BELIEVE THAT EVERY STUDENT

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.450
MATTERS AND FOR THE REASONS YOU

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:38.886
JUST HEARD DR MINOR DESCRIBING

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:41.655
THE IMPACT NOT ON JUST ACADEMIC

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:43.023
PREPARATION WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:45.159
FIRST YEAR AND THE OUTCOMES OF

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:46.260
THOSE CHANGES THE FIRST YEAR

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:47.995
COURSES. BUT THOSE

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:48.862
OPPORTUNITIES TO STEM

01:37:48.929 --> 01:37:50.998
DISCIPLINES TO BUSINESS THE

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:52.399
OTHER QUANTITATIVELY BASED

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:54.335
COURSES NURSING ARE OFTEN CUT

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:55.769
OFF BEFORE STUDENTS ARRIVE AND

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.438
SO AS I YOUR SHARE WE BELIEVE

01:37:57.504 --> 01:37:59.640
THAT YES WALL WE'RE VERY PROUD

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:01.041
THAT 91% OF OUR STUDENTS. ARE

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:02.710
ACHIEVING THAT LEVEL THIS IS

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:04.078
INTENDED TO MAKE SYSTEMIC

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:05.179
CHANGE SO THAT ALL STUDENTS

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.981
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IN CHOICE

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.316
OF MAJOR AND CHOICE TO PURSUE A

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:10.818
FIELD OF STUDY THAT BEST

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:12.486
POSITION THEM FOR THE FUTURE

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:13.420
AND WE BELIEVE THAT TO THE

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:16.857
POINT THAT JAMES MADE. ACADEMIC

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:17.424
PREPARATION MATTERS IN THIS

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:17.958
WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP IN

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:20.227
ADDRESSING. IF THE GOAL IS TO

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.963
INCREASE STEM OUTCOMES. WHY

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.865
DOES THE REQUIREMENT INCLUDE

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:26.600
NON STEM QUANTITATIVE REASONING

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:28.769
COURSES IS THERE CONCERN THAT

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.070
INCLUDING THESE COURSES COULD

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.305
ACTUALLY DECREASE THE

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:36.777
PROPORTION OF STUDENTS TAKING

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.978
I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER TO

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.780
THAT IS NOW I THINK ONE OF THE

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:41.982
REASONS YOU SEE THE INCLUSIVE

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:43.484
RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.085
COURSES AS A DOES A COMEDY

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.920
STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT CHOOSE TO

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:49.490
PURSUE A STEM MAJOR BUT WAS

01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:50.924
STILL BENEFIT FROM QUANTITATIVE

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:53.761
REASONING. PREPARATION AS I

01:38:53.827 --> 01:38:55.129
MENTIONED JUST PREVIOUSLY THE

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.097
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:58.432
WHO ARRIVE WITH THREE YEARS

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.601
COMPARED TO FOR ARE NOT ONLY

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:03.871
THE PRESENT ACROSS EVERY ETHNIC

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:06.674
GROUP OR ETHNICITY IT'S ALSO

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.376
PRESENT ACROSS EVERY MAJOR SO

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.512
EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT NON STEM

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:12.813
MAJORS AND YOU TAKE THOSE WHO

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.214
COME WITH THREE YEARS A

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.182
QUANTITATIVE PREPARATION.

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:17.418
COMPARED TO FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:19.653
TAKEN FOUR YEARS PERFORM BETTER

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.189
WHEN THEY ARE IN COLLEGE SO WE

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:24.191
WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THE BROAD

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:25.492
RANGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.127
TO ARRIVE TO THE C. ISSUE THIS

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:29.129
PROPOSAL STUDENTS WHO COMMON

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:30.731
THEY'RE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:31.965
FACT THAT THEY WANT TO BE ESTá

01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:33.467
MAJOR MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.035
ARE RIDE IN WITH THAT LEVEL OF

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:37.071
PREPARATION. BUT A STUDENT WHO

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:39.306
WE HAVE NOT ASKED TO DO THAT

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:41.041
WHO MAY WANT TO BE ESTA MAJOR

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:43.210
BUT CURRENTLY THE REQUIREMENTS

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:45.412
ONLY REQUIRE THAT STUDENTS TAKE

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:45.879
THREE YEARS OF MATH A

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:46.714
QUANTITATIVE REASONING THAT

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:50.184
STUDENTS. ARE ALMOST BY DEFAULT

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.919
IS ELIMINATED FROM BEING A STAY

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:53.787
MAJOR BEFORE THEY ARE ROLE IN

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:55.823
THEIR FIRST COLLEGE COURSE SO

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.358
THE IDEAL IS NATHAN IS MENTION

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.026
IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY RAISE THE

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:00.794
LEVEL OF PREPARATION FOR ALL

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:01.895
STUDENTS SO THAT THEY HAVE

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:04.631
REASONABLE CHOICES ABOUT THE

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:07.868
MAJOR CHOICE THAT THEY WANT TO

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:11.739
PURSUE STEM OR NOT STEM.

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:12.973
THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN RECENT

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:13.741
YEARS AN INCREASING I WOULD.

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:14.808
ELIGIBILITY RATES ESPECIALLY

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.310
AMONG LATINO STUDENTS. WHAT

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:19.213
RESEARCH HAS CSU DONE TO EXCESS

01:40:19.279 --> 01:40:21.281
THE IMPACT THAT THIS CHANGE

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:24.785
WOULD HAVE AN ELIGIBILITY. SO

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:27.321
AS YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:28.655
THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR YOUR

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:30.357
SHEET HERE WE SHOWED SORT OF

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.359
THE IMPACT OF OUTCOMES FOR

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:34.728
INCOMING STUDENTS WE'VE ALSO

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:37.231
APPLIED THAT TO OUR ANNUAL IN

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:38.298
ROLLED NEW STUDENTS AND

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:40.634
ADMITTED STUDENTS AND LOOKED AT

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.369
SORT OF TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:44.605
BASED ON CD E. DATA. FOR THE

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.774
FUTURE STUDENT POPULATIONS AND

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.975
AS WAS MENTIONED DURING THE

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.010
PRESENTATION WITH WE DO NOT

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:51.512
EXPECT ANY CHANGE IN

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:53.714
COMPOSITION ETHNICALLY RACIALLY

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:55.349
OF STUDENT POPULATIONS BASED ON

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.618
THIS CHANGE GIVEN WHAT WE SEE

01:40:57.684 --> 01:40:58.752
OCCURRING TODAY IS STUDENTS

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:00.320
ARRIVING AND TO THE

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:01.188
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE'VE

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.956
OUTLINED THAT WERE DESCRIBED IN

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:05.559
THE TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:06.160
BUILDING THAT ACT. ADDITIONAL

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:08.328
CAPACITY WHERE IT'S NEEDED. SO

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:09.963
WHAT IS CSU STRATEGY FOR

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:13.367
ENSURING. THAT THIS PROPOSAL IF

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.002
IMPLEMENTED DOES NOT REVERSE

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:17.838
THE TREND. LEADING AND LEADS TO

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:19.973
DECLINE OF ELIGIBILITY AMONG

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.075
LATINO AFRICAN MERICAN AND

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:26.146
OTHER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. WHO

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:26.780
CAN WE HOLD RESPONSIBLE IF THAT

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:30.150
HAPPENS. AND HOW DO YOU SUGGEST

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:32.219
THAT WE HOLD CSU RESPONSIBLE

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:34.188
SHOULD WE PROPOSED TO WITHHOLD

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:37.257
FUNDS FROM CSU JUST LIKE YOU'RE

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:38.859
PROPOSING TO WITHHOLD ADMISSION

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.061
FROM A STUDENT WHO DOES NOT

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:44.231
MEET THIS NEW HIGHER STANDARD.

01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:47.568
SO LET ME JUST SAY NO TO THE

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:51.305
POLLS PROPOSAL OF WITHHOLDING

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:55.576
FUNDS FROM THE C. ISSUE I. I

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:57.377
WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION

01:41:57.444 --> 01:42:00.881
SERIOUSLY I A THERE'S NOTHING

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.449
IN THE DATA ANALYSIS THAT WE

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:05.619
HAVE CONDUCTED HISTORICALLY OR

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:07.154
IN REAL TIME THAT WOULD SUGGEST

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:08.755
THAT THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:10.624
DECLINES OF STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.293
OR ELIGIBILITY FROM UNDERSERVED

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.629
COMMUNITIES IF THIS PROPOSAL

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:18.599
WERE ADOPTED EVERY MARCH THE

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:21.034
OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR GOALS

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:22.436
TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.738
MAKES A PART OUR PRESENTATION.

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:27.040
ON ACADEMIC PREPARATION WHICH

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:29.877
PROFILES INCOMING STUDENTS AND

01:42:29.943 --> 01:42:31.345
THEIR TRANS AND HOW THE

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.347
COMPOSITION OF INCOMING COURTS

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:36.416
LOOK COMPARED TO PREVIOUS YEARS

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.384
AND I THINK WE WOULD HAVE AN

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:40.120
ANNUAL WINDOW. IN TERMS OF HOW

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.722
THE COMPOSITION BOTH IN TERMS

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:44.191
OF GENDER ETHNICITY INCOME

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:46.159
LEVELS AND LEVELS OF

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:47.528
PREPARATION ARE CHANGING YEAR

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:48.996
OVER YEAR AND SO THERE'S AN

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.264
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BOARD

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.665
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.066
OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR WITH

01:42:53.133 --> 01:42:55.369
OUTBOARD ACTION IN SOME CASES.

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:57.437
ON TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IF

01:42:57.504 --> 01:42:59.473
FOR WHATEVER REASON WE SEE THAT

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.575
THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE TRANS

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:03.410
OF OUR INCOMING STUDENTS AGAIN

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.712
THE C. ISSUE IS NEVER BANK MORE

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.548
COMMITTED TO NOT ONLY ACCESS

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:11.084
BUT ALSO EQUITY. AND

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.920
MAINTAINING ITS RICH AND

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.187
DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:16.723
AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS NOT

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.625
INTENDED NOR THE WE THINK THAT

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:19.927
THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PROPOSAL

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:24.865
WILL HAVE NEGATIVE. EFFECTS ON

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:25.499
THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INCOMING

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:31.939
CLASS. IT'S BEEN MORE THAN

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:32.806
TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THE

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:33.507
LAST CHANGE DECEIT USE SEE

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:35.642
ISSUES ADMISSIONS. WE KNOW THAT

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.110
MANY HIGH SCHOOLS DO NOT

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:40.013
REQUIRE THE EXISTING AG EIGHT

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:40.581
THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:44.017
MISSION. WHY IS THAT THE CASE

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.986
AND HOW WOULD YOU HOW WOULD

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:46.520
THIS PROPOSAL AFFECT THAT

01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:50.490
SITUATION. SALT LET ME JUST SAY

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:51.825
WELL OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:54.194
MONTHS THAT WE'VE HAD LOTS A

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.529
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:57.731
PROPOSAL I HAVE MADE THE CASE

01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:00.233
THAT THE PROPOSAL. PERHAPS

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.569
UNFAIRLY BEARS THE BURDEN OF

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:04.037
MANY CHALLENGES IN PUBLIC

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:07.541
EDUCATION THE SCOPE OF THIS

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:08.108
PROPOSAL IS NOT INTENDED TO

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:12.212
SOLVE. EVERY PROBLEM IN PUBLIC

01:44:12.279 --> 01:44:13.780
EDUCATION WHO ARE ALL LET ME

01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:16.717
JUST BE VERY CLEAR THE PROPOSAL

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:19.386
ASK SIMPLY AMONG C. ISSUE BOUND

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:21.455
STUDENTS IS IT REASONABLE TO

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:23.357
ASK THEM TO TAKE ONE ADDITIONAL

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:24.725
COURSE IN QUANTITATIVE REASON

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.093
AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

FOR WHATEVER REASONS MANY OF

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.969
THEM ARE HORRIFIC I'M HORRIFIED

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:37.337
BY THE FACT THAT MANY STUDENTS

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:42.075
STILL A PATH FOR THOSE STUDENTS

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:44.144
TO THE CSU. HALF OF C. ISSUE

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:45.646
STUDENTS TODAY ARRIVE FROM

01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:47.614
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.383
SOLD THE PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY

COMMITTING TO DOUBLING THE

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:06.493
NUMBER OF MATH AND SCIENCE IN

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.861
COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS THAT

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:10.430
WE PREPARE WITH THIS ADDITIONAL

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:14.434
FUNDING. AND WE'RE. DEVELOPING

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:14.968
AN IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENT TO

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:17.037
IMPLEMENT WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:20.407
OUT HOW TO DO IT. OVER THE OVER

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:22.709
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS WE

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:24.144
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE MATH

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.545
AND SCIENCE TEACHER INITIATIVE

01:46:25.612 --> 01:46:27.380
SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND SO

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:30.617
WE KNOW THE STRATEGIES WE ALSO

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:33.854
KNOW WE NEED TO. INCREASE

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.424
PRODUCTION TO BETTER MEET THE

NEEDS AND AS I WAS IT MENTIONED

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:41.094
EARLIER WE'VE IDENTIFIED SCHOOL

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:43.230
DISTRICTS WERE GOING TO START

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:45.232
SO THAT THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:46:45.298 --> 01:46:46.933
THAT APPEAR TO HAVE

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.069
INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY OR

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:50.904
SCHOOLS WHERE THE COURTS TAKING

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:52.372
PATTERNS OF STUDENTS ARE NOT

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:54.441
ALLOWING THEM OR ENCOURAGING

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:56.243
THEM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL MATH

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:58.011
SCIENCE OR QUANTITATIVE

01:46:58.078 --> 01:46:58.645
REASONING COURSES THAT'S WHAT

01:46:58.712 --> 01:46:59.179
WE'RE GOING TO START OUR

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:01.648
EFFORTS. LUCIUS WHO HAS A LONG

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:02.949
HISTORY OF PARTNERING WITH OUR

DEPARTMENTS A COUNTY OFFICES OF

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:06.386
EDUCATION TO THE TO DO THIS

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:07.921
WORK SO THAT'S WHAT WE INTEND

01:47:07.988 --> 01:47:09.723
TO DO. YOU MENTIONED THE TEN

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.292
MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING. SO MY

01:47:12.359 --> 01:47:14.127
QUESTION IS WHERE IS THAT TEN

01:47:14.194 --> 01:47:15.395
MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING COMING

01:47:15.462 --> 01:47:17.330
FROM AND FROM WHAT OTHER

01:47:17.397 --> 01:47:19.099
PURPOSES ARE THE FUNDS BEING

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.967
SHIFTED TO SUPPORT THIS

01:47:21.034 --> 01:47:22.736
INITIATIVE SO THAT TEN MILLION

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.604
IS WAS PART OF A YOU MAY RECALL

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:27.741
IN THE- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OUR

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:28.708
STATE BUDGET. ON THE STATE

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.911
ALLOCATED A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:32.579
MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS FOR

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:33.780
ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO THE C.

01:47:33.847 --> 01:47:36.216
ISSUE THAT WAS TO BE SPREAD

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:39.719
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS OVER A

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:44.157
FOUR YEAR PERIOD IN THE- CSU.

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.258
PROVIDED A PLAN BACK TO THE

01:47:45.325 --> 01:47:45.859
STATE OVER AND WHAT WOULD BE

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:46.426
pDONE WITH THAT THESE DOLLARS

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:47.460
ARE TAKEN FROM THE ENROLLMENT

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:48.094
GROWTH THAT ONE TIME ENROLLMENT

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.330
GROWTH FUNDING. AT CHALLENGE

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:51.565
WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS THAT

01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:53.233
IT IS A WELL THAT THAT'S A ONE

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.602
TIME. ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:57.170
TO AN ONGOING COMMITMENT BUT

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:58.605
OUR PROGRAM PROGRAMS LIKE

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.306
TEACHER EDUCATION THAT ARE

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.308
OFTEN COMPLETED WITHIN ONE YEAR

01:48:01.374 --> 01:48:03.310
OF POST SECONDARY WORK OR THAT

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:06.079
CAN INCREASE CAPACITY. IN OUR

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:07.147
INTEGRATED TEACHER EDUCATION

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:08.782
PROGRAMS ARE A PERFECT USE OF

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:09.950
AND ONE TIME IN ROMAN DOLLARS

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:12.619
SO THEY COME FROM. THAT

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:13.153
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.355
ALLOCATION ONE ONE TIME DOLLARS

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:15.956
FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH THIS THE

01:48:16.022 --> 01:48:18.491
ISSUE. SO WHAT IS THE ISSUE

01:48:18.558 --> 01:48:19.926
DOING NOW TO ENSURE THAT IS

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.962
GRADUATES. GOING TO TEACH IN

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:23.864
ALL AREAS OF THE STATE.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.298
INCLUDING AREAS LIKE MY OWN

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:27.234
INLAND EMPIRE. AND THE CENTRAL

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.502
VALLEY WHERE STUDENTS TYPICALLY

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:32.472
HAVE LESS ACCESS TO QUALIFIED

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:35.275
STEM TEACHERS AND STEM COURSES.

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.910
AGAIN THIS WORK BUILDS UPON THE

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:38.211
MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHER

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.412
INITIALLY BORK THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:40.714
ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST

SEVERAL DECADES. AND WE ARE

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:44.885
REDOUBLING OUR EFFORTS TO WORK

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.419
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOL

01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:47.520
DISTRICT PARTNERS AND COUNTY

OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:51.458
THAT WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:53.393
SUPPLY OF MATH SCIENCE AND

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:56.897
COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS. TO

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:57.397
MEET THIS THESE AREAS OF

01:48:57.464 --> 01:49:02.736
SHORTAGE. SO I SEE THE ROLE

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:04.471
THAT SHE IS YOU AND THE PRINT

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.573
THIS PROPOSAL ENSURING MARK

STUDENTS AND GRADUATES HAVE A

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:25.659
STRONGER STEM FOUNDATION. BUT

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.694
WHY NOT JUST PURSUE CAPACITY

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:29.763
BUILDING ON THE PART OF THE CSU

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:32.232

WITH INCREASING ADMISSION

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.972
REQUIREMENTS. IN OTHER WORDS

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:41.942
WHY NOT JUST IT CONTINUED TO

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.443
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STEM

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:48.682
TEACHERS. WITHOUT. IT'S TWO IN

01:49:59.559 --> 01:50:00.593
I WOULD JUST SAY QUICKLY

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.195
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT I THINK

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:05.065
RATHER THAN EVEN EITHER OR WE

01:50:05.131 --> 01:50:08.268
PREFER BOTH AND A FEW WEEKS AGO

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:10.270
THE C. ISSUE HOSTS A COUNSELOR

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:12.906
CONFERENCE HIGH SCHOOL

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:13.540
COUNSELORS ALL ACROSS THE STATE

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:16.076
OF CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF THEM

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:16.643
HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:21.281
PROPOSAL. AND MANY OF THEM

01:50:21.348 --> 01:50:22.482
AGREE WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT

01:50:22.549 --> 01:50:24.117
HERE'S WHAT STRUCK ME IN SOME

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:29.422
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:30.857
ALTHOUGH THERE COULD BE A

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:32.525
COMMITMENT IN IS A COMMITMENT

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:33.593
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:36.262
TEACHERS WHAT WE REQUIRE AND

01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:37.797
OUR EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:39.766
MATTERS THE NUMBER OF HIGH

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:41.167
SCHOOL COUNSELORS WHO SAID TO

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:43.737
ME JAMES YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:44.237
THE NUMBER STUDENTS WERE

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:46.539
LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL AT NOON.%

01:50:46.606 --> 01:50:47.941
BECAUSE THEY FOR FEEL THE HIGH

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:50.110
SCHOOL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS

01:50:50.176 --> 01:50:51.444
AND THEY'VE ALREADY MET THE CSU

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.413
ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS AND

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.048
BECAUSE WE DON'T ASK THEM TO DO

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:58.184
ANYTHING MORE THEY DON'T. THEY

01:50:58.251 --> 01:51:01.087
DON'T. AND SO I THINK IT IT IS

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:02.589
A POSSIBLE YES WE NEED TO

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:03.723

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:09.262
A HIGH NEED AREAS BUT I THINK

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:10.897
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:13.066
REQUIRE WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:51:13.133 --> 01:51:14.534
STUDENTS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:16.703
UPON ARRIVAL. AS I THINK YOU

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:17.303

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:11.891
YOU. GOT HOLD SOLD PROFESSING

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:15.895
SO LET ME JUST. ANSWER MORE

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:16.796
DIRECTLY I THINK YOU HEARD IN

01:57:16.863 --> 01:57:17.830
THE FIRST TESTIMONY THAT WHEN

01:57:17.897 --> 01:57:18.398
THESE CHANGES OCCUR. SCHOOLS

01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:19.799
DISTRICTS. AND SCHOOLS AND

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.467
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES A JEST.

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.368
THE SECOND THING I WOULD I

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:23.503
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT. YOU

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:25.271
KNOW I DON'T WANT US TO OVER

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:27.540
ESTIMATE WHAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED

01:57:27.607 --> 01:57:28.341
FOR STUDENTS TO MEET THIS

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:30.710
REQUIREMENT. AGAIN VIRTUALLY

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:32.311
EVERY COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL

01:57:32.378 --> 01:57:34.080
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:36.449
COURSES IN PLACE TO DAY. THAT

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:38.818
WOULD MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. A

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:39.919
NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.721
YOU HEARD NAY TH AND SAID AS A-

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.623
BY PRODUCT OF GRADUATING THE

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:44.857
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE MET THIS

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:46.793
REQUIREMENT. AND SO I JUST WANT

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:48.661
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT THE

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:50.396
LEFTY AS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:53.633
TO GO FROM FIFTEEN COURSES TO

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.701
SIXTEEN COURSES OVER SIX OR

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:56.536
SEVEN YEAR PERIOD YOU'RE SAYING

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:58.438
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF LIFE. I

01:57:58.504 --> 01:57:59.372
JUST DON'T THINK IT'S

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:00.940
INSURMOUNTABLE WHAT ARE SCHOOL

01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:01.841
DISTRICTS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:03.776
SOME CHANGES. ARE TOUGH CHOICES

01:58:03.843 --> 01:58:05.111
AND BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS FOR

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:06.612
COLLEGE YES ADAM ALREADY HAVE

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:07.847
THOSE COURSES AND THEY'RE NOT

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.348
BEING. UTILIZED BY STUDENTS

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:10.883
GOING WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.185
THAT WE HAVE NOT REQUIRE

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:15.121
STUDENTS TO TAKE. THE LEVEL OF

01:58:15.188 --> 01:58:16.689
PREPARATION REQUIRE FOR THEM TO

01:58:16.756 --> 01:58:19.225
BE SUCCESSFUL UPON ENTRY OKAY.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:21.694
AND THEN AS FAR AS THE BUT MAY

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:23.963
I MAY I MORE DIRECTLY OR IN A

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.765
IN A PERHAPS. A DIFFERENT WAY

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:30.503
ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:34.941
MANNER ASSEMBLYMEMBER CART. WE

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:35.741
COMMIT TO CONTINUING OUR

01:58:35.808 --> 01:58:36.309
COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH OUR

01:58:36.375 --> 01:58:36.943
SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS AND SO

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:37.743
THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OUR

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.245
E. R. W. C. COURSE. AND SO

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:42.114
RIGHT NOW WE ARE AND WE HAVE AN

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:44.083
MRI WC COURSE OF THIS IS A

01:58:44.150 --> 01:58:45.251
FOCUS ON MATHEMATICAL

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:47.854
REASONING. THAT WE WILL USE THE

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.723
SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF THE R. WC.

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.492
WHICH IS BEING DISTRIBUTED

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:53.759
THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES OF

01:58:53.826 --> 01:58:55.461
EDUCATION AND OFFER THIS COURSE

01:58:55.528 --> 01:58:56.896
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE HIGH

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:59.765
SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION TO WORKING

01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:02.134
WITH THEM TO DEVELOP AND

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:04.403
IDENTIFY EXISTING Q. R. COURSES

01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:05.204
THAT ARE IN THEIR COURSE

01:59:05.271 --> 01:59:07.640
SCHEDULE RIGHT NOW SO. SO

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:09.075
THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT WE

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.776
WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IS TO

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.311
PARTNER WITH OUR SCHOOL

01:59:12.378 --> 01:59:13.246
DISTRICTS TO BUILD THIS

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:15.081
CAPACITY OVERTIME GOTCHA. AND

01:59:15.147 --> 01:59:17.350
AS FAR AS THE EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:18.851
THE STUDENTS THAT THAT WAS ONE

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:20.553
OF MY- CONCERNS I DIDN'T QUITE

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.255
UNDERSTAND THE POLICY YOU'RE

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.222
SAYING THAT. IF YOU'RE A

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:25.591
STUDENT. WHO AND YOUR AT A

01:59:25.658 --> 01:59:26.893
SCHOOL WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:28.594
OPTION FOR YOUR FOURTH YEAR.

01:59:28.661 --> 01:59:31.664
YOUR EXEMPTED BUT IT'S AN

01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:33.299
AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION OFF TO DO A

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.767
SUPPLEMENTAL APPLICATIONS

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:35.902
CORRECT SO IT DOESN'T GET ALL

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.169
ON THE STOOD ON THE STUDENT OF

01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:38.538
THE FAMILY MEMBER THAT'S A KEY

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.306
QUESTION NEXT PANEL AND WHAT'S

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:40.873
THE BIG DEAL IF YOU ALREADY

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:43.376
HAVE THIS. AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:46.012
IN THERE AND THEN AS FAR AS

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:47.313
IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING THE

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.347
NORMALLY YOU WOULD THINK THAT

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:50.249
THAT YOU SEE WHAT HAVE THE

01:59:50.316 --> 01:59:53.352
HIGHER STANDARD SO WITH. CSU

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:55.488
COMING BEFORE YOU SEE. AS

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:57.990
SOMEWHAT ODD TO ME AND SO MEYER

01:59:58.057 --> 01:59:59.825
SETTING IS THE LAST TIME WE DID

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.460
THE A THREE G. CHANGES THEY

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:04.263
KIND OF CAME. AS A PACKAGE AND

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:06.365
THIS ONE'S KIND OF A ONE OFF.

02:00:06.432 --> 02:00:08.501
AND YOU WOULD THINK. THAT THE

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:10.369
UC ONE WOULD COME FIRST NOT THE

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:12.138
CSU NOT KNOCKING THIS IS YOU OF

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:14.240
COURSE I'M CSU GRADUATE THANK

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:16.342
YOU. BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TOUCH

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:19.412
ON THAT. SO LET ME JUST SAY

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:21.147
QUICKLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:23.616
ADDRESS AND I DON'T WORK FOR

02:00:23.683 --> 02:00:25.718
THE UC SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

02:00:25.785 --> 02:00:31.390
UC. BUT WHAT I NOW AND THEN. WE

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:32.024
DO IT ALL THE TIME I'M NOT WELL

02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:32.525
WELL MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:38.497
LIBERTY HERE. BUT WHAT WE KNOW

02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:39.532
ABOUT THE COMPOSITION AND THE

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:40.132
PROFILE OF THEIR INCOME IS

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.267
STUDENTS IS PROBABLY 99% OF

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:43.102
THEM. ARRIVE WITH FOUR OR MORE

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:44.470
YEARS OF MATH OF QUANTITATIVE

02:00:44.537 --> 02:00:45.104
NINE SIX YARDS A NOMINATION FOR

02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:47.106
THAT SECTOR. OKAY AND THAT

02:00:47.173 --> 02:00:47.773
LEADS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION SO

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.375
YOU TALKED ABOUT WHICH I WAS

02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:52.945
INTERESTED THAT 91% OF YOUR

02:00:53.012 --> 02:00:58.718
STUDENTS A ROLE THAT CSU HAVE

02:00:58.784 --> 02:01:01.587
TAKEN FOR MORE COURSES RIGHT.

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:04.857
NOT 91% OF INCOMING STUDENTS

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:06.492
WOULD HAVE MET THIS REQUIRE YET

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:09.428
ONCE YOU ADD AREA SEE AREA DE

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.297
AN AREA SHE COURSES THAT'S KIND

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:12.665
OF WHEN I MET BUT YES MUCH

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:15.534
BETTER. SO OUT OF THIS OTHER

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:19.071
STUDENTS. THAT THAT. IT DIDN'T

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:21.374

YOU SAY THAT THAT THEY'RE

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:31.183
DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:32.685
STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T HAVE THESE

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:34.954
COURSES ABSOLUTELY YEAH.

ABSOLUTELY IT'S A STUDENTS WHO

02:01:37.023 --> 02:01:38.491
ARE BEHIND THE REASON THERE BE

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:39.592
ASK IF THE MISTER ENOS QUESTION

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:41.627
THE WRITTEN THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

UNEQUIVOCALLY. LET'S LET'S

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:45.431
START START RIGHT HERE THIS IS

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:46.565
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY SO

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:47.733
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE STUDENTS

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.036
WHO ARE BEHIND WHEN THEY ENTER

CSU NEED REMARK REMEDIATION.

02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:53.406
THEIR DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.174
STUDENTS WHO HAD THREE OR FEWER

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:56.709
OF THESE COURSES AND SO THEY

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.210
JUST THERE. THEY START BEHIND

02:01:58.277 --> 02:02:00.713
THE STAY BEHIND ABSOLUTELY AND

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:02.715
HOW HOW HOW CAN YOU. BE SO

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.116
CONFIDENT CAN YOU WALK THROUGHS

02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:06.085
NUMBER WELL WHAT WE DO WE CAN

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:08.287
LOOK AT THE PROFILE OF INCOMING

02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:09.555
STUDENTS AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:10.823
PROFILE OF STUDENTS AND

02:02:10.890 --> 02:02:13.159
PREVIOUS CALL COURTS WHO WERE

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:15.695
REQUIRED. TO TAKE DEVELOPMENTAL

02:02:15.761 --> 02:02:16.729
EDUCATION COURSES OR WOULD

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:18.931
DEEMED UNDERPREPARED YEAH AND

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:22.735
DISPROPORTIONATELY. THOSE

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:27.339
STUDENTS ARE STUDENTS OF COLOR.

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:27.840
THOSE STUDENTS ARE FIRST

02:02:27.907 --> 02:02:28.407
GENERATION STUDENTS AND ALL

02:02:28.474 --> 02:02:29.141
STUDENTS HAVE LIMITED

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:30.576
PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:31.210
REASONING A MATHEMATICS TO VERY

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:34.080
CLEAR. AND ONE THING THAT'S

02:02:34.146 --> 02:02:34.714
INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK AT AT

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:37.917
CSU YOU'RE MUCH MORE DIVERSE

02:02:37.983 --> 02:02:39.852
THAN THE THAN THE UC SO IF THIS

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.554
WAS A CHANGE THAT YOU SEE

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:42.955
ADDING A. B. GREATER CONCERN

02:02:43.022 --> 02:02:44.790
BECAUSE- UNDERREPRESENTED

02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:46.525
STUDENTS THAT YOU SEE IN CS AT

02:02:46.592 --> 02:02:49.261
UC ART ARE ALREADY HAVING A

02:02:49.328 --> 02:02:51.297
TOUGH TIME. MEETING THE NUMBERS

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:53.766
ARE AT BUT THE PIPELINE OF HIGH

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:57.436
SCHOOL GRADUATES. IS VERY

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:58.037
DIVERSE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO

02:02:58.104 --> 02:03:00.473
THE NUMBERS FOR CSU. THE

02:03:00.539 --> 02:03:02.208
MAJORITY OF CS USE OUR HISPANIC

02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:03.542
SERVING INSTITUTIONS YEAH

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.144
BECAUSE 50% OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:06.779
KIDS. REAP REFLECT THAT

02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:08.547
POPULATION. AFTER AMERICAN

02:03:08.614 --> 02:03:11.016
POPULATION I THINK IS PRETTY ON

02:03:11.083 --> 02:03:13.519
PAR WITH HIGH SCHOOL GRAD RATES

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:16.255
AT CSU IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. SO

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:17.890
IF THIS POLICY WENT INTO A

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:19.492
FACT. WOULD YOU HAVE ANY

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:21.327
CONCERN THAT THE DIVERSITY

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:24.396
NUMBERS WOULD CHANGE OR THEY

02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:25.030
WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AS FAR AS

02:03:25.097 --> 02:03:27.900
YOUR INCOMING. CLASS I OR

02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:29.802
PRESIDENT TRANSFER STUDENTS I

02:03:29.869 --> 02:03:31.971
DON'T I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:32.905
REMEMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:35.941
TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AND I THINK

02:03:36.008 --> 02:03:36.709
FOR CURRENT MIDDLE SCHOOLERS

02:03:36.776 --> 02:03:40.312
TODAY IF IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE

02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:41.914
BORE WAS TO ADOPT THIS POLICY

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:43.749
THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR ONE

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:44.617
ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE

02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:47.620
REASONING COURSE. WAS REQUIRED

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:48.954
FOR MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY FOR THE

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:52.424
C. ISSUE THIS IS A REASONABLE

02:03:52.491 --> 02:03:54.226
ASKED TO STRENGTHEN THE

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:55.194
PREPARATION OF INCOMING

02:03:55.261 --> 02:03:57.429
STUDENTS. THEN WE ASK ABOUT

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.698
CAPACITY AND CAPACITY BUILDING

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.567
OVER THE SEVEN YEAR PERIOD

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:03.302
THERE'S NOTHING IN OUR ANALYSIS

02:04:03.369 --> 02:04:05.271
THIS SUGGESTS THAT THIS WOULD

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:07.840
ALTER CURTAIL ACCESS FOR

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:09.308
HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:11.911
POPULATIONS THERE JUST ISN'T.

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.479
THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.880
IS THAT MANY MORE OF THEM

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:17.783
BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE UC. BY

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.151
WAY OF STRENGTHENED IN THEIR

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:24.190
PREPARATION SO I'D I DON'T WANT

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:29.929
US TO BE. I DON'T WANT US TO A

02:04:29.995 --> 02:04:32.598
TO EXAGGERATE THE PROPOSITION

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:35.000
THAT SOMEHOW THIS BE A STUDENTS

02:04:35.067 --> 02:04:36.836
ARE NOT GOING TO RESPOND TO

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:37.436
THIS AND THEREFORE WE'RE GOING

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:39.371
TO HAVE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES.

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:42.942
AND AN ELIGIBILITY OR THE

02:04:43.008 --> 02:04:43.475
RACIAL COMPOSITION OF OUR

02:04:43.542 --> 02:04:46.512
INCOMING CLASS YEAH. OKAY AND

02:04:46.579 --> 02:04:47.079
THEN LASTLY BEFORE IT'S THE

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:51.884
NEXT. LOOKS LIKE. YEAH I

02:04:51.951 --> 02:04:53.085
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THEIR

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:54.954
EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS ARE

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:57.256
CHANGING THE THAT NEED FOR MORE

02:04:57.323 --> 02:04:59.091
STEM THE ECONOMIC CHANGES FOR

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:01.760
WHAT BUT GRADUATES ARE SO YOU

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:02.795
KNOW YOU YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:05.164
AS TWO WAYS YOU CAN BE LIKE. AS

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:08.434
AS THEY ARE. SIR CONSULTANT

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:11.503
OUTLINED EARLIER. IN THAT

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:13.572
RATIONING OF ACCESS SO HE SAID

02:05:13.639 --> 02:05:14.106
THIS KIND OF THE WE TALKED

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:17.209
ABOUT THERE IS THAT. FOR

02:05:17.276 --> 02:05:18.577
WHATEVER REASONS THEY ONLY HAVE

02:05:18.644 --> 02:05:19.678
TWENTY THREE CAMPUS AREAS WERE

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:21.847
IMPACTED WE HAVE MORE MORE HIGH

02:05:21.914 --> 02:05:23.148
SCHOOL GRADUATING STUDENTS THE

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.516
STATE'S BY GIVING IT UP ENOUGH

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:27.353
MONEY TO FIND ON ROMAN SO YOU

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:28.320
NEED TO HAVE SOME. THING AND

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:30.322
THERE TO LIKE THROW A WET

02:05:30.389 --> 02:05:33.158
BLANKET ON THE EXPECTATIONS OF

02:05:33.225 --> 02:05:34.226
STUDENTS TRYING TO GO TO

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:37.630
COLLEGE. BUT OF THE FLIP SIDE

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:38.364
OF COURSE IS YEARS YOU'RE

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:41.000
SAYING. THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:42.434
THE REALITY FOR WHAT STUDENTS

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:45.271
NEED TO SUCCEED AT CSU AND NOT

02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:48.207
BEING REMEDIATION. AND MEET THE

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:49.975
REQUIREMENTS FOR BUT A COLLEGE

02:05:50.042 --> 02:05:53.012
GRADUATE NEEDS IN THIS IN THIS

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:56.849
ECONOMY. SO. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:58.183
ONE MORE TIME TO. INDIVIDUALS

02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:59.251
WHO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS AT THIS

02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:01.921
WOULD. LIMIT ACCESS FOR

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:03.989
STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN

02:06:04.056 --> 02:06:05.991
THIS BUSINESS I WOULD THINK TO

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:08.294
AND THE CSU. TO LIMIT ACCESS TO

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.929
CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY YOU EXIST

02:06:09.995 --> 02:06:12.564
IN SO. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO

02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:14.500
THAT. THE GOOD THAT HELD THE

02:06:14.566 --> 02:06:17.336
LESSONS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:18.437
GROUPS AT ARKANSAS ALL BEGAN

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:20.839
AND ALL ALL TURN MY COLLEAGUES

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:23.108
TO ROUND OUT A RESPONSE. YOU

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.610
WON'T WHEN WE EVEN THOUGH AS

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:25.811
HAS BEEN CHAIRED THIS

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:27.713
CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ONGOING

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:30.382
SENSE OF OUR ACADEMIC SENATE

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.084
CREATED THEIR TASK FORCE ON

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:34.253
THIS TOPIC IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:34.787
WITH A REPORT IN TWENTY

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:37.356
SIXTEEN. ALONG THAT SAME TIME

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:38.590
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PRIOR

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:40.159
SPEAKER THE STATE CONDUCTED AN

02:06:40.225 --> 02:06:41.360
ELIGIBILITY STUDY WHICH

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:42.895
ULTIMATELY FOUND THE BASED ON

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:45.531
THE GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY

02:06:45.597 --> 02:06:46.031
FIFTEEN OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:50.669
STUDENTS. BUT THE C. ISSUES.

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:51.203
CURRENT CRITERIA CAPTURING

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:55.407
ABOUT 41% OF THE STUDENTS. AT

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:56.475
THAT POINT OUR TRUSTEES OUR

02:06:56.542 --> 02:06:59.011
SYSTEM EXAMINE THAT DATA AND

02:06:59.078 --> 02:06:59.812
MADE A DECISION TO MAKE NO

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:00.446
CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY IT THE

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:02.414
CSU REINFORCED ITS COMMITMENT

02:07:02.481 --> 02:07:04.683
TO ACCESS THIS CONVERSATION WAS

02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:05.951
BORN OUT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:08.020
ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND WHAT

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.121
REALLY IS IMPORTANT FOR

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.689
STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

02:07:10.756 --> 02:07:12.524
OUR INSTITUTION AND ALSO TO BE

02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:14.026
SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA IN THE

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:15.427
FUTURE IN THE FACE OF SORT OF

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:17.396
CHANGING WORKFORCE AND SOCIETAL

02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:18.697
NEEDS WHETHER THAT BE IN STEM

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:20.699
DISCIPLINES WHETHER BEING JUST

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.234
UNDERSTANDING BASIC INFORMATION

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:23.535
SCIENCE BEING ABLE TO.

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:25.304
UNDERSTAND POLITICAL POLLING

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:27.039
AND DATA COMING OUT THEM ON A

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.607
DAY TO DAY BASIS I'M IT REALLY

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:30.476
BEGAN IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:31.810
WHAT WAS NECESSARY AND THE

02:07:31.877 --> 02:07:33.645
NECESSARY ACADEMIC PREPARATION

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:35.447
SO THERE WAS AN EASIER CHANGE

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.349
TO MAKE IF IT REALLY WAS ABOUT

02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:39.184
CURTAILING ACCESS BASED ON THAT

02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:41.420
ELIGIBILITY STUDY FROM TWENTY

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.021
FIFTEEN THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS

02:07:42.087 --> 02:07:43.489
CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT IT

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.024
REALLY WAS ABOUT WHAT IS THE

02:07:45.090 --> 02:07:47.326
BEST PREPARATION NECESSARY TO

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:48.827
ADDRESS EQUITY AND MAKE SURE

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:50.329
ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:07:50.396 --> 02:07:53.599
COMPETITIVE. FOR CSU STUDENTS

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:54.166
AND IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN.

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:58.337
LASTLY WE. WHAT'S WHEN IS THE

02:07:58.404 --> 02:08:00.639
PROPOSED HEARING. AND THE VOTE

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:01.173
FOR THIS AT THE CSU BOARD

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.641
JUSTICE THIS WILL BE ON THE-

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:04.676
BOARD AGENDA FOR THEIR NOVEMBER

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:05.944
BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING WHICH

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:06.412
I BELIEVE IS NOVEMBER

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:08.647
NINETEENTH AND TWENTY OKAY

02:08:08.714 --> 02:08:09.281
COMING UP. ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:12.484
MICHAEL. THANK YOU MISTER MEDIA

THANK YOU. PERHAPS COMMENTS

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:20.592
RATHER THAN QUESTIONS SINCE WE

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:23.128
HAD THE DISCUSSION HERE IN THIS

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:24.163
COMMITTEE AND WE SAW THE

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:26.298
LEGISLATION BOTH FOR COMMUNITY

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:29.334
COLLEGE AND CSU TO GET RID OF

02:08:29.401 --> 02:08:31.970
REMEDIAL CLASSES I VERY MUCH

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:33.705
GET THE THRUST OF THAT HAVING

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:35.374
BEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.309
INSTRUCTOR HAVING BEEN

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:39.812
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHRISTY. YOU

02:08:39.878 --> 02:08:42.247
KNOW I KNOW VERY WELL THAT BOTH

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:44.516
AT THE CSU AND AT THE COMMUNITY

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:45.884
COLLEGE WHEN STUDENTS WERE

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:47.820
STOCK AND HAVING TO TAKE

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:50.522
REMEDIATION IN A MATH AND

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:52.558
ENGLISH AND I HAD MORE

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.560
EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMMUNITY

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:57.229
COLLEGE THEY WOULD NEVER GET TO

02:08:57.296 --> 02:09:00.365
COLLEGE LEVEL MATH OR ENGLISH

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:02.568
AND SO IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:05.804
TO. GET AN A DEGREE OR A FOUR

02:09:05.871 --> 02:09:06.939
YEAR DEGREE IF YOU'RE ALWAYS

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:08.874
STUCK AND REMEDIATION I THINK

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:11.510
THAT WAS THE THRUST OF BOTH THE

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:14.046
LEGISLATION FOR A COMMUNITY

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:17.516
COLLEGE AND THE CSU AND THEN I

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:21.353
SAW IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AT

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:25.657
STANFORD AND DINO. A CSU CAL

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:27.092
STATE SALMON A DINO WITH THE

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:30.229
BRIDGE PROGRAM I'D BRING IN AND

02:09:30.295 --> 02:09:32.531
SOME STUDENTS OVER THE SUMMER

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:35.567
TO DO VERY FAST BRINGING THEM

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:39.104
UP TO SPEED BUT DURING THE

02:09:39.171 --> 02:09:39.671
SUMMER AND CONTINUING DURING

02:09:39.738 --> 02:09:43.308
THE ACADEMIC YEAR. BUT THIS

02:09:43.375 --> 02:09:44.143
PROPOSAL SEEMS TO ME TO BE

02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:45.844
SOMEWHAT OF A REVERSE OF COURSE

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:48.514

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.202
MAKE IT HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO

APPLY TO CAL STATE ESPECIALLY

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:14.439
BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS SO

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:17.142
THIS SEEMS TO ME A REVERSAL OF

02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:19.378
STAKING STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE

02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:21.914

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:24.356
TO CLOSE THE STUBBORN RACIAL

STATE. WE ARE RELENTLESSLY

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.762

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:46.778
HANDOUTS THAT I WANTED TO

QUICKLY GO THROUGH. ON PAGE TWO

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:53.685
OF THE HAND OUTS YOU CAN SEE

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:54.352
WHY WE CARE ABOUT RACIAL EQUITY

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:54.986
AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HAS

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:56.087
BECOME MORE AND MORE DIVERSE.

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:57.789
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:14:57.856 --> 02:14:59.758
ADULTS IN OUR STATE ONLY 12% OF

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:01.760
LAST NEXT ADULTS HAVE A

02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:03.929
BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THAT

02:15:03.995 --> 02:15:06.364
COMPARES 232% OF ALL

02:15:06.431 --> 02:15:08.567
CALIFORNIANS BUT IN THAT GRAPH

02:15:08.633 --> 02:15:10.735
YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERYBODY

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:13.205
TRAILS WHITE AND ASIAN AMERICAN

02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:15.040
STUDENTS IN OUR STATE AND THAT

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.508
SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO ALL

02:15:16.575 --> 02:15:18.610
OF US. OF COURSE THE CSU PLAYS

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:20.278
A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:22.314
CALIFORNIA HAS THE EDUCATED

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.149
POPULACE THAT WE NEED AND THAT

02:15:24.216 --> 02:15:26.918
WE MEET WORKFORCE DEMAND. BY

02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:27.552
TWENTY THIRTY ALL OF YOU KNOW

02:15:27.619 --> 02:15:30.222
THAT 60% OF ADULTS WILL NEED TO

02:15:30.288 --> 02:15:31.723
HAVE SOME POST SECONDARY

02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:33.592
EDUCATION. THAT MEANS THAT WE

02:15:33.658 --> 02:15:35.260
NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS NOT

02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:37.696
CONSTRAIN IT AND ESPECIALLY

02:15:37.762 --> 02:15:38.797
NEED TO INCREASE THAT FOR BLACK

02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:41.032
IN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS WE HAVE

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:42.968
FOUGHT ALONGSIDE THE CSU EVERY

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:45.003
YEAR WITH THEM. DURING THE

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.705
STATE BUDGET SEASON TO INCREASE

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:48.139
THE NUMBER OF SPOTS AVAILABLE

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.741
FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND FOR

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.409
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN EFFORTS

02:15:51.476 --> 02:15:53.645
LIKE THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE.

02:15:53.712 --> 02:15:55.080
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE WORKED

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:57.749
AND SUPPORTED CAMPUSES IN ORDER

02:15:57.816 --> 02:15:59.184
TO STAVE OFF DECLARING

02:15:59.251 --> 02:16:01.286
IMPACTION. BUT THIS PROPOSED

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:02.454
CHANGE TO ELIGIBILITY

02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:03.989
REQUIREMENTS THREATENS COLLEGE

02:16:04.055 --> 02:16:05.857
OPPORTUNITY BY MAKING CSU MORE

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:08.460
SELECTIVE THAN EVER BEFORE. AND

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.795
THAT UNFOUNDED SELECTIVITY

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:15.267
THREATENS OUR STATE. INSIDE

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:15.901
THREE YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:16.468
NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS THAT

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:18.069
WE'VE OUTLINED AND WILL SPEAK

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:23.241
PARTICULAR THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:25.844
RED FLAGS THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS.

02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:27.379
FIRST THE CSU CONTINUES TO

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:28.480
RAISE THE BAR FOR ADMISSIONS

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:30.582
HIGHER AND HIGHER SUCH THAT IT

02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:31.416
IS BECOMING OUT OF REACH FOR

02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:33.318
FAR TOO MANY STUDENTS

PARTICULARLY BLACK LIGHT NEXT A

TIME OUR STUDENTS REACH THE NEW

02:16:38.356 --> 02:16:40.792
ADMISSION BAR THE CSU SETS. THE

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.594
MOVE IT OUT FURTHER THAT IS

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:44.729
WHAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD DO.

02:16:44.796 --> 02:16:45.730
THE MOVING OF THE BAR IS

02:16:45.797 --> 02:16:47.465
DIRECTLY TIED TO MANAGING

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:48.500
ENROLLMENT AND IMPROVING

HAPPENS WHEN STUDENTS ARE AT

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:56.241
THE CSU IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.777
TALKING ABOUT NOT RAISING THE

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:01.246
BAR ON THE STUDENTS THAT GET IN.

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:03.014
SECOND THE CSU PROPOSAL IS

02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:04.482

QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSE.

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:16.828
IF THE CSU IS SERIOUS ABOUT

02:17:16.895 --> 02:17:17.696
THIS PROPOSAL THEY SHOULD BE

02:17:17.762 --> 02:17:19.764

LEGISLATURE. IT THREATENS TO

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:40.352
MISALIGNED COLLEGE READINESS

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:42.253

KEY REGIONS OF THE STATE. WE

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:56.268
CANNOT PUT A POLICY IN PLACE

02:17:56.334 --> 02:17:57.769
NOTING THAT IT WILL HAVE A

02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:00.271
DISPARITY IMPACT IT IS

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:02.941
IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNACCEPTABLE.

A THREE G. THEY FAR EXCEED IT.

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:34.072
THE RESULT OF IMPACTION. HAS

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:35.774
MEANT STUDENTS MUST MEET A MUCH

HIGHER BAR FOR ADMISSION HERE

02:18:38.009 --> 02:18:38.910
YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE HIGH

02:18:38.977 --> 02:18:40.979
SCHOOL GPA ENROLLED STUDENTS AT

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.814
FULLY IMPACTED CAMPUSES HAVE TO

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:45.417
MEET. BUT LOOKING ACROSS ALL

02:18:45.483 --> 02:18:46.551
TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES THE

02:18:46.618 --> 02:18:48.386
AVERAGE HIGH SCHOOL GPA OF

02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:49.888
ENROLLING FRESHMAN IS NEAR A

POINT OH IN A THROUGH G. THEY

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:57.729
WOULD NEED AT THIRTEEN FIFTY S.

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.497
A. T. TO MEET MINIMUM

02:18:59.564 --> 02:19:02.667
ELIGIBILITY AT THE CSU. AT

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:03.301
THIRTEEN FIFTY FOR THOSE OF YOU

02:19:03.368 --> 02:19:04.903
WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE STUDENTS

02:19:04.969 --> 02:19:07.439
THAT ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL TODAY

02:19:07.505 --> 02:19:08.073
CAN GET YOU INTO ALMOST ANY IVY

02:19:08.139 --> 02:19:10.842
LEAGUE IN THE COUNTRY. THE BAR

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:12.777
HAS ALREADY BEEN RAISED AND

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:13.511
STUDENTS ARE PROVING TIME AND

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:14.946
TIME AGAIN THAT THEY'RE

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:18.183
QUALIFIED. IN THE NEXT SLIDE. I

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:19.718
WANT TO JUST POINT OUT A FEW

02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:22.320
MORE THINGS. 40% OF CALIFORNIA

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:24.022
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND

02:19:24.089 --> 02:19:24.756
GRADUATES ARE CURRENTLY

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:26.925
ELIGIBLE FOR THE CSU. AND THE

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:28.960
STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY COMPLETED

02:19:29.027 --> 02:19:29.994
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.196
QUANTITATIVE REASONING COURSES

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:33.364
THAT'S THREE YEARS OF MATH TWO

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.365
YEARS OF A LAB SCIENCE AND HALF

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:36.701
A SEMESTER OF ECONOMICS. AND

02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:37.902
LET ME BE CLEAR FIVE AND A HALF

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:39.804
YEARS IS JUST THE MINIMUM CSU

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:41.539
ESTIMATES THAT INCOME INCOMING

02:19:41.606 --> 02:19:43.608
STUDENTS AVERAGE APPROXIMATELY

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.477
TWENTY ONE A THREE G. COURSES

02:19:45.543 --> 02:19:48.346
WHEN SIXTEEN. ARE REQUIRED. SO

02:19:48.413 --> 02:19:50.348
STUDENTS ARE LIKELY STUDENTS

02:19:50.415 --> 02:19:51.783
ARE VERY LIKELY TAKING MUCH

02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:53.284
MORE QUANTITATIVE REASONING

02:19:53.351 --> 02:19:54.819
PRIOR TO CSU THAN JUST THE FIVE

02:19:54.886 --> 02:19:56.621
AND A HALF YEARS. THAT MEANS

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:57.856
THAT DESPITE YEARS OF

02:19:57.922 --> 02:19:59.224
PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE

02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:00.925
REASONING CSU IS STILL DOING AN

02:20:00.992 --> 02:20:02.260
INSUFFICIENT JOB AT GRADUATING

02:20:02.327 --> 02:20:04.229
THE STUDENTS IF THEY'RE SAYING

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:05.897
THE REASON FOR THIS IS TO

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:09.801
IMPROVE THEIR GRADUATION RATES.

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:10.668
CS USE OWN DATA SHOWS THAT ONLY

02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:11.636
TWENTY FOR WORK 24% OF STUDENTS

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:12.737
WITH AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:14.038
QUANTITATIVE REASONING.

02:20:14.105 --> 02:20:16.307
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. AND

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:19.344
ONLY SEVENTEEN AND 18% OF BLACK

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:21.579
AND WHITE NEXT STUDENTS. WHO'VE

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:22.947
TAKEN THE ADDITIONAL YEAR OF Q.

02:20:23.014 --> 02:20:25.116
R. GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. THE

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:26.751
Q. R. PROPOSAL IS HARDLY THE

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:28.653
SILVER BULLET FOR IMPROVED

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:31.489
GRADUATION AT THE CSU. INSTEAD

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:34.459
IT WILL BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:35.059
USING MATH AS A FILTER TO KEEP

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:38.196
STUDENTS OUT. ON THE NEXT SLIDE

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.665
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. TEACHERS

02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:42.433
AND QUALITY AND THE NUMBER OF

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:43.601
QUALIFIED TEACHERS BECAUSE I

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:45.403
KNOW THAT'S A CONCERN. THAT

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:48.273
MANY OF US SHARE. SO INSIDE SIX

02:20:48.339 --> 02:20:49.741
YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ADDED

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:51.810
INEQUITIES IN A THREE G. ACCESS

02:20:51.876 --> 02:20:54.112
ALREADY EXIST AT OUR SCHOOLS.

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:55.847
ESPECIALLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:57.982
UNDER RESOURCE RACIALLY

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:59.184
STRATIFIED AND OVERWHELMINGLY

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:01.920
LOW INCOME. ARGUMENTS ABOUT A

02:21:01.986 --> 02:21:03.855
LACK OF CAPACITY QUALIFIED

02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:05.857
TEACHERS AND GREATER INVESTMENT

02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:07.125
TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF Q.

02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:10.395
R. EQUITABLY HAS FALLEN ON DEAF

02:21:10.461 --> 02:21:12.931
EARS AT THE CSU. STUDENTS

02:21:12.997 --> 02:21:14.599
HAILING FROM LOW INCOME AREAS

02:21:14.666 --> 02:21:15.767
ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:19.070
UNQUALIFIED TEACHERS IN MATH

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:19.637
AND SCIENCE THAN STUDENTS IN

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:22.841
HIGHER INCOME AREAS. THERE'S

02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:23.708
PLENTY OF DATA ANDRESEARCH ON

02:21:23.775 --> 02:21:25.743
THAT COURSE AVAILABILITY AT A

02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:27.912
CAMPUS WHICH IS YOU KNOW AN

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:29.614
ASSESSMENT THAT CSU HAS DONE

02:21:29.681 --> 02:21:31.382
ARGUING THAT THESE COURSES ARE

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:32.750
ALREADY AVAILABLE AT MOST

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.752
CAMPUSES. DOESN'T MEAN EVERY

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:38.356
KID GETS A SEAT. IN FACT I'LL

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:40.225
SHOW YOU A SLIDE ON A THREE G.

02:21:40.291 --> 02:21:43.161
COMPLETION BY RACE IN THE NEXT.

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:45.230
HAND OUT YOU CAN SEE THAT MORE

02:21:45.296 --> 02:21:47.198
THAN 60% OF BLACK AND WHITE

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:48.666
NEXT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:51.202
ALREADY IN ELIGIBLE FOR THE COW

02:21:51.269 --> 02:21:54.038
STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THAT

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:57.342
IS TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT. THE

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:58.843
NEXT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE A

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:01.212
THROUGH G. COMPLETION BY REGION

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.214
AND THAT VARIES TO WITH SAN

IN INLAND EMPIRE AND THE NORTH

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:18.630
COAST HAVING SOME OF THE WORST.

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.832
THIS IS WHY SEVERAL PROMINENT

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.767
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE EXPRESSED

02:22:22.834 --> 02:22:25.536
THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS EFFORT.

02:22:25.603 --> 02:22:27.205
YOU HAVE A LIST OF FOLKS

02:22:27.272 --> 02:22:29.173
OPPOSED INCLUDING LA UNIFIED

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:37.115
UNIFIED. THEY REPRESENT ALMOST

02:22:37.181 --> 02:22:39.250
14% OR SIX POINT ONE MILLION OF

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:40.718
ALL K. TWELVE STUDENTS IN

02:22:40.785 --> 02:22:42.186
CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE OPPOSED

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:45.723
TO THIS POLICY TO. IN THE NEXT

02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:47.358

THROUGH G. COMPLETION BY INCOME.

02:22:51.029 --> 02:22:51.963
SO THAT WE CAN JUST BE CLEAR IN

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:53.731
ON THE SAME PAGE THAT

02:22:53.798 --> 02:22:57.735
ESSENTIALLY. IF YOU'RE HIGHER

02:22:57.802 --> 02:23:00.571
INCOME STUDENT YOU'RE MUCH MORE

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:01.172
LIKELY TO COMPLETE THE A THREE

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:05.043
G. WE HAVE YET TO SEE EVIDENCE

02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:06.477
FROM THE C. S. USED TO

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:07.812
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CLAIM THAT

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.080
THIS PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD NOT

02:23:09.147 --> 02:23:10.415
HAVE DESPAIRED IMPACT ON

02:23:10.481 --> 02:23:11.716
STUDENTS SEEKING ACCESS TO THE

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:14.352
CSU. NO ELIGIBILITY STUDY HAS

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:16.487
BEEN DONE SO TOGETHER WITH OUR

02:23:16.554 --> 02:23:18.256
COLLEAGUES AT JUST EQUATIONS

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:19.424
AND AT TRUSTS WEST WE

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.626
COMMISSIONED RTI INTERNATIONAL

02:23:21.693 --> 02:23:22.627

STATE'S LAST ELIGIBILITY STUDY

02:23:25.330 --> 02:23:26.831
TO EXAMINE HOW INCREASING

02:23:26.898 --> 02:23:27.865
REQUIREMENTS WITH AN ADDITIONAL

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:29.701
YEAR OF MATHEMATICS OR SCIENCE

02:23:29.767 --> 02:23:32.036
WOULD IMPACT ELIGIBILITY RATES.

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:33.671
USING DATA FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.573
GRADUATING CLASS OF TWENTY

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:36.507
FIFTEEN THESE REQUIREMENTS

02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:38.676
WOULD HAVE REDUCED ELIGIBILITY

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.678
FROM FORTY ONE TO THIRTY FOUR

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:42.313
PERCENT. THIS CHANGE WOULD

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:45.683
RENDER NEARLY 80% OF BLACK HIGH

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:46.317

ELEVEN. WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE

02:23:53.791 --> 02:23:56.594
EFFECT THAT ARE TI MODELED BY

02:23:56.661 --> 02:23:58.830
REGION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN

02:23:58.896 --> 02:23:59.998
GROWING REGIONS LIKE THE

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:01.899
CENTRAL VALLEY ELIGIBILITY

02:24:01.966 --> 02:24:06.337
RATES WOULD GO FROM 34% 227% TO

02:24:06.404 --> 02:24:07.839
BE CLEAR WE WOULD LOSE AS MANY

02:24:07.905 --> 02:24:10.108
AS ONE FIFTH OF OUR PREVIOUSLY

02:24:10.174 --> 02:24:10.641
ELIGIBLE STUDENTS FROM THE

CENTRAL VALLEY. INSIDE TWELVE

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:16.180
YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT ON BLACK

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:18.416
STUDENTS NEARLY A QUARTER OF

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:19.450
BLACK STUDENTS PREVIOUSLY

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:21.119
ELIGIBLE WOULD NO LONGER BE

02:24:21.185 --> 02:24:23.721
ELIGIBLE UNDER THE NEW CRITERIA.

02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:25.456
AN IN FLIGHT THIRTEEN YOU CAN

02:24:25.523 --> 02:24:26.057
SEE THE IMPACT FOR LIGHT NEXT

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:29.394
STUDENTS. THE NUMBER OF LACKEY

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.496
LET NEXT STUDENTS WHO ARE CSU

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:33.264
ELIGIBLE WOULD DROP BY ABOUT

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:35.700
20% THAT'S OVER FIVE THOUSAND

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:39.337
LET NEXT STUDENTS EVERY YEAR.

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:41.239
PP I SEE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A

02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:42.407
PIECE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

02:24:42.473 --> 02:24:44.175
CHANGING QUANTITATIVE REASONING

02:24:44.242 --> 02:24:45.643
REQUIREMENTS EMPHASIZING THAT

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:46.978
IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE MORE

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:49.047
CONFUSION FOR STUDENTS AND SOME

02:24:49.113 --> 02:24:51.449
STUDENTS. WHO QUALIFY FOR THE

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:54.185
UC MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR THE CSU.

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:55.620
THE CSU CLAIMS THAT IF WE USE

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:57.422
IF THE UC ADDS AN ADDITIONAL

02:24:57.488 --> 02:24:58.723
YEAR SCIENCE TO ITS ADMISSIONS

02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:59.924
REQUIREMENTS THERE WOULD BE

02:24:59.991 --> 02:25:01.259
OVERLAP FOR STUDENTS WHO WOULD

02:25:01.325 --> 02:25:02.260
WANT TO APPLY TO THE TWO

02:25:02.326 --> 02:25:04.262
SYSTEMS. BUT YOU SEE IS STILL

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:05.329
CONDUCTING A RIGOROUS

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:07.131
INDEPENDENT STUDY ON THE

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:10.334

APPROVED AND MAY NOT EVEN OCCUR.

02:25:13.371 --> 02:25:15.640
SO HOW CAN WE MOVE FORWARD. YOU

02:25:15.706 --> 02:25:17.008
HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A LIST OF

02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:18.543

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:30.014
SIGNIFICANT BACKLASH THIS

PROPOSAL IS RECEIVING A

02:26:31.549 --> 02:26:32.683
SYMPTOMATIC OF A LARGER ISSUE

02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:35.219
FACING CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:35.987
THE LACK OF A COORDINATING

02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:38.222
ENTITY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WE

02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:39.457
PROUDLY SUPPORTED THE

02:26:39.524 --> 02:26:40.992
LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT TO

02:26:41.058 --> 02:26:42.059
ESTABLISH A COORDINATING AND TO

TV AB ONE THIRTY WHICH WAS

02:26:44.362 --> 02:26:46.230
RECENTLY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:47.765
HOWEVER IT IS THIS TYPE OF

02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:49.300
ENTITY THAT IS BOTH INDEPENDENT

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:50.968
OF THE SYSTEMS BUT HAS THE

02:26:51.035 --> 02:26:52.370
AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE

02:26:52.436 --> 02:26:53.804
SYSTEMS TO ALIGN WITH EACH

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:56.207
OTHER TO WORK TOGETHER WITH K.

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:57.141
TWELVE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR

02:26:57.208 --> 02:26:59.377
STATE THAT WE NEED TO REVIEW

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:01.212
WHAT IS COLLEGE READINESS. IN

02:27:01.279 --> 02:27:04.282
RELATION TO OUR DEMANDS WHAT

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:04.916
MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF FUNDING

02:27:04.982 --> 02:27:07.785
FOR THE STATE. WE URGE YOU TO

02:27:07.852 --> 02:27:09.520
APPOINT A TASK FORCE THAT CAN

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:11.022
ASSESS COLLEGE READINESS ACROSS

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.690
THE STATE AND CONDUCT AN IMPACT

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:13.891
STUDY TO ASSESS THESE

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:16.060
ELIGIBILITY. CHANGES ONE THAT

02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:18.429
IS INDEPENDENT AND TRANSPARENT

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:21.666
FROM EACH OF THE SEGMENTS. WE.

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:23.301
THE CSU MUST FOSTER GREATER K.

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:26.504
TWELVE COLLABORATION. K. TWELVE

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:27.538
COLLABORATION HAS BEEN AN

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:29.373
AFTERTHOUGHT WITH K. TWELVE

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.575
ONLY BEING BROUGHT IN WITHIN

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:31.342
THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS FOR

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:32.843
PROPOSAL THAT HAS HUGE

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:35.680
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SYSTEM

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:36.681
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND ONCE

02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:39.217
AGAIN IT RESPONSIBLE. THE CSU

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:41.886
SHOULDN'T KICK THE CAN TO K.

02:27:41.953 --> 02:27:42.386
TWELVE TO IMPROVE THEIR

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:44.488
GRADUATE GRADUATION RATES.

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:44.989
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS

02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:48.392
PROPOSAL WILL DO. FINALLY ANY

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:50.194
CHANGES THAT EVENTUALLY OCCUR

02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:51.596
WITHIN ADMISSIONS MUST BE

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:52.964
RIGOROUSLY MONITORED BY THE

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.066
LEGISLATURE WE URGE THE

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.601
LEGISLATURE TO SET THE STANDARD

02:27:56.667 --> 02:27:58.336
BY WHICH CSU REPORTS ON ITS

02:27:58.402 --> 02:27:59.604
PROGRESS OF ANY ADMISSION

02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:01.606
CHANGES SUCH THAT THE OUTCOMES

02:28:01.672 --> 02:28:05.009
ARE TRANSPARENT AND REGULAR AND

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:05.610
SUCH THAT WE INSURE THAT THERE

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:08.112
ISN'T TO SPIRIT IMPACT. WE

02:28:08.179 --> 02:28:10.147
CONTINUE TO STAND WITH THE CSU

02:28:10.214 --> 02:28:11.449
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:12.683
WHETHER OR NOT THE CSU NEEDS

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:14.252
MORE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO EXPAND

02:28:14.318 --> 02:28:15.720
CAPACITY THEY DO AND WE URGE

02:28:15.786 --> 02:28:18.522
YOU TO PROVIDE IT. WE ARE

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:20.124
TURNING AWAY TOO MANY ELIGIBLE

02:28:20.191 --> 02:28:21.993
STUDENTS AT A TIME WHEN OUR

02:28:22.059 --> 02:28:22.827
ECONOMY IS DEMANDING A MORE

02:28:22.893 --> 02:28:25.129
EDUCATED POPULACE. WE STAND

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:26.564
WITH THE CSU AND ENSURING

02:28:26.631 --> 02:28:28.099
FUNDING FOR THE GRADUATION

02:28:28.165 --> 02:28:29.667
INITIATIVE AND EFFORTS LIKE

02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:31.269
REMOVING THE REMEDIAL EDUCATION

02:28:31.335 --> 02:28:33.337
BARRIER POLICIES THAT LOOK AT

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:34.572
HOW CS USE OWN INTERNAL

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:36.274
POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:39.543
HINDERING STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT

02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:41.279
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:43.547
STAND FOR STUDENTS FIRST AND

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:44.181
THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PUT THEM

02:28:44.248 --> 02:28:47.985
FIRST. I WANT TO JUST CLOSE BY

02:28:48.052 --> 02:28:49.020
SHARING A FEW THINGS IN

02:28:49.086 --> 02:28:51.255
RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS PANELIST

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:53.291
AND REMARKS THIS IS ABOUT

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:57.361
MANAGING ENROLLMENT. IT IS

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:58.696
ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE AN

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:00.831
OUTCOME OF A NEW ADMISSIONS

02:29:00.898 --> 02:29:03.067
REQUIREMENTS IT IS RATIONING

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:06.837
AND SORTING THAT'S WHAT IT DOES.

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:09.040
IT IS AS CSU DECLARES ABOUT

02:29:09.106 --> 02:29:12.343
STUDENT SUCCESS. BUT IT FOCUSES

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:14.211
ON THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND

02:29:14.278 --> 02:29:16.047
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:22.153
WHAT STUDENTS THE CS. I OFTEN

02:29:22.219 --> 02:29:23.621
SAY THAT IT WOULD BE A MUCH

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:26.057
MORE HELPFUL CONVERSATION FOR

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:27.925
COLLEGES TO STOP TALKING ABOUT

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:29.760
STUDENTS BEING COLLEGE READY

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:31.762
AND FOR THEM TO LOOK IN THE

02:29:31.829 --> 02:29:32.363
MIRROR AND ASK THEMSELVES ARE

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:36.067
THEY STUDENT READY. I URGE YOU

02:29:36.133 --> 02:29:37.435
TO JOIN CIVIL RIGHTS AND

02:29:37.501 --> 02:29:38.769
EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE

02:29:38.836 --> 02:29:40.504
STATE TO EXPRESS YOUR STRONG

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:43.374
CONCERN TO THIS PROPOSAL. I

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:45.309
ALSO WANT TO ADD IT'S ONLY BEEN

02:29:45.376 --> 02:29:48.379
TWO YEARS SINCE EXECUTIVE ORDER

02:29:48.446 --> 02:29:49.680
ELEVEN HUNDRED AND ELEVEN TEN

02:29:49.747 --> 02:29:50.815
WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:52.983
CSU. BUT APPARENTLY MEMORIES

02:29:53.050 --> 02:29:55.553
ARE SHORT. THE CAMPAIGN FOR

02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:56.754
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY CIVIL

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.155
RIGHTS LEADERS EDUCATION

02:29:58.222 --> 02:30:01.158
LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE. MUCH

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:03.361
SUPPORTED THAT PROPOSAL IN FACT

02:30:03.427 --> 02:30:05.730
WE WERE CHAMPIONING IT WITH THE

02:30:05.796 --> 02:30:07.631
MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT

02:30:07.698 --> 02:30:09.133
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BY

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:11.469
STUDENTS. IT WAS A GOOD POLICY

02:30:11.535 --> 02:30:15.039
FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. SO I

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:17.007
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF ON BRIDGE

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:17.641
AT SAYING THAT FOLKS ARE AFRAID

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:21.078
OF CHANGE. WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF

02:30:21.145 --> 02:30:22.813
CHANGE. NEITHER ARE OUR

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:25.583
STUDENTS IN FACT THEY KEEP

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:27.885
MEETING THE BAR EVERY TIME YOU

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:28.452
RAISE IT. WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR

02:30:28.519 --> 02:30:31.622
CHANGE. EVERY YEAR FOR OUR

02:30:31.689 --> 02:30:36.727
STUDENTS. SO THAT GRADUATION

02:30:36.794 --> 02:30:38.362
AND ACCESS TO COLLEGE WOULD BE

02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:40.765
POSSIBLE SO THAT GETTING THAT

02:30:40.831 --> 02:30:43.167
DEGREE AND WALKING ACROSS THE

02:30:43.234 --> 02:30:43.701
STAGE WOULDN'T JUST BE AN

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:48.272
ILLUSION. BUT THIS POLICY

02:30:48.339 --> 02:30:51.108
PROPOSAL THIS PROPOSED CHANGE

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.843
DOES NOT MEET THE ONLY BAR THAT

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.812
MATTERS IT IS NOT GOOD FOR

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:56.480
STUDENTS AND IT IS NOT GOOD FOR

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.382
EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA SO I HOPE

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:00.084
YOU EXPRESS YOUR STRONG

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:01.685
CONCERNS TO THE CAL STATE

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:07.825

02:33:34.905 --> 02:33:38.342
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR NATE

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:38.909
THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF

02:33:38.976 --> 02:33:41.779
EDUCATION PROGRESS HOW SHOULD

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:43.781
ONE DECIDE WHAT IS BASIC WHAT

02:33:43.847 --> 02:33:49.620
IS PROFICIENT. ARE AT CENTER.

02:33:49.687 --> 02:33:50.187
AND FINALLY I JUST FINISHED

02:33:50.254 --> 02:33:54.024
SHARING. A COMMITTEE THAT WAS

02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:56.393
CHARGED WITH DESIGNING A

02:33:56.460 --> 02:33:59.930
NATIONAL SYSTEM OF INDICATORS

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:02.032
FOR EDUCATION EQUITY IN K.

02:34:02.099 --> 02:34:09.273
TWELVE. ALL RIGHT THAT'S ME. I.

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:10.374
I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:11.475
POLITICAL WITH THE POLITICAL

02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:12.977
FORCES LINED UP BUT I THINK

02:34:13.043 --> 02:34:14.979
MICHELLE READ YOU A VERY

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:16.580
IMPRESSIVE LIST OF WHO HAS

02:34:16.647 --> 02:34:18.882
WEIGHED IN ON IT I'D VENTURE TO

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:20.718
SAY THAT ALMOST ALL OF THE

02:34:20.784 --> 02:34:24.355
ORGANIZATIONS ON HER LIST KNOW

02:34:24.421 --> 02:34:27.758
MORE ABOUT HIGH SCHOOLS. AND K.

02:34:27.825 --> 02:34:29.693
TWELVE CURRICULUM. THEN THE

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:36.033
ACADEMIC SENATE OF CSU. SECOND.

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:39.603
WHATEVER CSU DECIDES TO DO. IT

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:42.039
IS A BUILDING ON THE EXISTING

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:44.808
SYSTEM AND THE INEQUITIES THAT

02:34:44.875 --> 02:34:45.342
ARE ALREADY BAKED INTO THE

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:47.745
EXISTING SYSTEM. MOST

02:34:47.811 --> 02:34:50.414
IMPORTANTLY FOR OUR PURPOSES

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:53.550
THE CAPACITY ISSUES AND MOST

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:54.051
IMPORTANT ABOUT CAPACITY

02:34:54.118 --> 02:34:57.287
TEACHERS. EFFECTIVE QUALIFIED

02:34:57.354 --> 02:35:05.029
TEACHERS. WE KNOW. THAT SCHOOLS

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.363
THAT HAVE HIGHER MINORITY

02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:08.232
ENROLLMENTS HIGHER ENROLLMENTS

02:35:08.298 --> 02:35:11.001
OF POOR CHILDREN. ARE MORE

02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:13.737
LIKELY TO HAVE HAVE TEACHER

02:35:13.804 --> 02:35:19.043
SHORTAGES IN STEM AND MATH. 80%

02:35:19.109 --> 02:35:21.912
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS 80% OF

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:23.981
SCHOOL DISTRICT CURRENTLY

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:24.581
REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE TEACHER

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:29.219
SHORTAGES. STEM AND SPECIAL ED

02:35:29.286 --> 02:35:34.525
ARE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES. THE

02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:36.326
EXISTENCE OF A COURSE IN A HIGH

02:35:36.393 --> 02:35:41.298
SCHOOL. DOES NOT MEAN THAT.

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:43.600
EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO TAKE IT

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:44.201
WILL BE ABLETO TAKE. AND THAT

02:35:44.268 --> 02:35:47.137
IS A CRITICAL POINT. I YOU

02:35:47.204 --> 02:35:48.972
CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE COURSE

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:53.343
CATALOG AND ASSUME THAT. IT

02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:58.449
MEANS GENUINE ACCESS ODD TO.

02:35:58.515 --> 02:35:59.683
FOUR YEARS OF MATH AND

02:35:59.750 --> 02:36:03.353
QUANTITATIVE REASONING. BOB

02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:08.292
NUMBER THREE. THE CORE

02:36:08.358 --> 02:36:12.062
CONCEPTUAL ISSUE HERE IS TO ME

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:14.164
I WHO SHOULD BE MAKING THE

02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:17.601
POLICY ABOUT WHAT. THE ACADEMIC

02:36:17.668 --> 02:36:19.636
RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR

02:36:19.703 --> 02:36:20.137
CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGH

02:36:20.204 --> 02:36:26.810
SCHOOLS. THIS IS NOT THE

02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:28.245
NINETEEN TWENTIES WHEN A

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:30.314
THROUGH F. WAS ADOPTED BY STE

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:33.617
BY CSU AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:36.286
THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY. IN

02:36:36.353 --> 02:36:38.155
FACT IT'S NOT EVEN NINETEEN

02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:40.858
SIXTIES SINCE THE MASTER PLAN.

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:43.527
THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED NOT

02:36:43.594 --> 02:36:46.430
ONLY A DIFFERENT SET OF

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:49.299
GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS FOR K.

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:50.100
TWELVE BUT A COMPLETELY

02:36:50.167 --> 02:36:52.069
DIFFERENT FINANCING STRUCTURE

02:36:52.136 --> 02:36:54.204
MORE STATE MONEY THAN THERE WAS

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:56.673
BEFORE THE MASTER PLAN OPS MORE

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:59.343
STATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR K.

02:36:59.409 --> 02:37:02.212
TWELVE THAN THERE USED TO BE. I

02:37:02.279 --> 02:37:07.084
AND MUCH MORE. SO I THINK THAT

02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:08.519
THE TRADITION OF HAVING THE

02:37:08.585 --> 02:37:13.423
FACULTIES OF CSU AND YOU SEE.

02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:14.491
STEER THE HIGH SCHOOL

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:19.429
CURRICULUM BOAT. IS OUTDATED.

02:37:19.496 --> 02:37:20.664
THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT X.

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.834
EXPERTISE. AND IT SHOULD BE

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:29.072
ABOUT LEGITIMACY. BUT THE

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:34.378
DEEPER PROBLEM EVEN TO THAT. IS

02:37:34.444 --> 02:37:34.978
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE AS POLICY

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:40.017
MAKERS THAT PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS

02:37:40.083 --> 02:37:42.686
SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH PUBLIC.

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:48.025
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I IT

02:37:48.091 --> 02:37:48.725
TOO TWO OF THE PREVIOUS

02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:51.361
SPEAKERS HAVE SAID THAT CSU

02:37:51.428 --> 02:37:52.963
TAKES IT BELIEVES ITS

02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:54.832
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MEET

02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:57.467
STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE. WELL

02:37:57.534 --> 02:38:01.972
WHERE THEY ARE. IS NOT FOUR

02:38:02.039 --> 02:38:03.740
YEARS OF MATH A QUANTITATIVE

02:38:03.807 --> 02:38:08.278
REASONING. THE BATTLE NOW IS

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:10.547
OVER WHETHER IT'S THE

02:38:10.614 --> 02:38:11.148
RESPONSIBILITY OF UNDER FUNDED

02:38:11.215 --> 02:38:12.883
HIGH SCHOOLS. BY THAT EXTRA

02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:18.355
PREPARATION. FOUR TWO FOUR TO

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:20.591
REQUIRE THAT ARE COLLEGES ARE

02:38:20.657 --> 02:38:24.895
UNDER FUNDED COLLEGES. PROVIDE

02:38:24.962 --> 02:38:29.700
FOR THAT EXTRA PREPARATION. I

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:31.735
ALSO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT

02:38:31.802 --> 02:38:34.504
WHAT AN ACADEMIC SET ACADEMIC.

02:38:34.571 --> 02:38:38.809
SENATE SAYS ABOUT. REQUIREMENTS

02:38:38.876 --> 02:38:42.279
AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. IS

02:38:42.346 --> 02:38:43.647
RARELY IF EVER BASED ON

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:46.283
EVIDENCE IT'S MOSTLY BASED AND

02:38:46.350 --> 02:38:48.051
I SAY THIS AS A LONG TIME

02:38:48.118 --> 02:38:49.953
ACADEMIC IT'S MOSTLY BASED ON

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:52.189
FACULTY POLITICS. AND IT'S

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:57.961
BASED ON. SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS.

02:38:58.028 --> 02:38:59.696
FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:02.499
VALIDITY CHECKS. GREEK AND

02:39:02.566 --> 02:39:11.375
LATIN. WORK IN PART. A SENSE OF

02:39:11.441 --> 02:39:11.975
COLLEGE PROFESSORS OF WHAT IT

02:39:12.042 --> 02:39:14.478
MEANS TO BE EDUCATED. THERE'S

02:39:14.544 --> 02:39:16.914
NO EVIDENCE ABOUT THEIR UTILITY

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.982
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE ABOUT HOW

02:39:19.049 --> 02:39:19.549
IT WOULD PREDICT SUCCESS IN

02:39:19.616 --> 02:39:23.887
COLLEGE. SIMILARLY I THINK WHAT

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:26.690
WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT TO

02:39:26.757 --> 02:39:27.791
PROMOTE COLLEGE SUCCESS. MORE

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:32.229
MAPS. MORE MATH WHY NOT MORE

02:39:32.296 --> 02:39:40.137
WRITING. I. MORE WRITING WOULD

02:39:40.203 --> 02:39:40.671
BE MORE USEFUL IN THE REAL

02:39:40.737 --> 02:39:44.775
WORLD. THERE IS NO EXTERNAL

02:39:44.841 --> 02:39:46.343
VALIDITY STUDY BE OFFERED BY CS

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:49.746
YOU AS TO WHY ADDITIONAL MATH

02:39:49.813 --> 02:39:50.347
AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING OUR

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:54.484
REPORT. TO SAY THAT THEY ARE

02:39:54.551 --> 02:39:55.986
CORRELATED WITH HIGHER

02:39:56.053 --> 02:39:57.721
COMPLETION RATES AND HIGHER

02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:58.755
PERSISTENCE IN HIGHER

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:01.758
EDUCATION. IS TO ME RATHER FAIR

02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:04.962
NONSENSICAL. IT'S THERE IS NO

02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:07.998
THEORY THAT MAKES IT A CAUSAL

02:40:08.065 --> 02:40:09.633
CONNECTION IT'S ONLY A

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.803
CORRELATION MOREOVER. IT MAY

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:14.538
NOT BE THE BEST CORRELATION IT

02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:16.239
MAY NOT BE THE BEST PREDICTOR

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:20.310
OF IMPROVED. POST SECONDARY

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:24.147
OUTCOMES. I AS COMPARED WITH

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:28.318
FOR EXAMPLE GPA OR SCORES ON

02:40:28.385 --> 02:40:34.658
THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT.

02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:35.258
FOR IF I CAN BE IRONIC FAMILY

02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:39.796
INCOME. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:42.599
LOOKING AT EXPOSURE TO MATH WE

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:44.334
KNOW THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.603
QUALITY MATH IS CORRELATED WITH

02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:48.605
SOCIAL WITH WITH POVERTY AND

02:40:48.672 --> 02:40:52.442
WITH THE RACE. IF YOU PUT MORE

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:53.944
EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF MATH

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:56.947
PREPARATION. THEN YOU'RE

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:58.281
PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON

02:40:58.348 --> 02:41:06.156
WHITENESS. AND HI INCOME. I

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:10.127
THINK THAT'S AN EQUITY ISSUE.

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:10.660
AND I DON'T THINK THE CSU

02:41:10.727 --> 02:41:15.565
FACULTY. IS THE SOURCE OF.

02:41:15.632 --> 02:41:19.269
DECISION MAKING ON. HOW MUCH

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:22.139
INEQUITY IS TOO MUCH I THINK

02:41:22.205 --> 02:41:25.776
PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE. A WORD

02:41:25.842 --> 02:41:26.376
ABOUT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:32.315
THIS. BOB. THE END OF THE

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:34.551
CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION'S

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:39.523
EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. A

02:41:39.589 --> 02:41:41.591
DISPARATE IMPACT OF A POLICY

02:41:41.658 --> 02:41:43.560
MAKES IT A CRIME OFFICIALLY

02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:44.127
CASE FOR VIOLATION OF EQUAL

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:48.999
PROTECTION. I BELIEVE THE

02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:50.333
EVIDENCE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.668
THERE WILL BE A DISPARATE

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:54.671
RACIAL IMPACT FROM ADOPTING

02:41:54.738 --> 02:41:56.773
THIS AS THINGS CURRENTLY STAY

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:59.409
AT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:01.511
ABOUT WHO'S TAKING THESE

02:42:01.578 --> 02:42:02.112
COURSES WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS

02:42:02.179 --> 02:42:06.883
COURSE. IF THAT IS TRUE THEN WE

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:08.185
HAVE TO ASK WHETHER THERE IS

02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:09.386
WHAT STATE YOU HAVE TO

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.888
ESTABLISH. WE'LL HAVE TO

02:42:11.955 --> 02:42:13.023
ESTABLISH BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF

02:42:13.090 --> 02:42:15.325
THEY ADOPT THIS POLICY IT WILL

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:18.662
VERY QUICKLY UP BE LITIGATED.

02:42:18.728 --> 02:42:22.632
BY CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEYS. CS

02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:24.334
YOU WILL HAVE THE BURDEN OF

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:24.835
SHOWING THAT THEY HAVE A

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:27.471
COMPELLING INTEREST. AT THAT

02:42:27.537 --> 02:42:29.339
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE POLICY

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:32.342
THAT THEY COULD ADOPT. THAT.

02:42:32.409 --> 02:42:33.977
WOULD SERVE THAT INTEREST WITH

02:42:34.044 --> 02:42:39.416
LESS. DISPARATE IMPACT. BUT WE

02:42:39.483 --> 02:42:42.285
KNOW THE GPA AT THE RESEARCH

02:42:42.352 --> 02:42:46.123
SHOWS US THAT BOTH GPA AND THE

02:42:46.189 --> 02:42:48.091
SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT ARE

02:42:48.158 --> 02:42:50.560
VERY GOOD PREDICTORS OF

02:42:50.627 --> 02:42:54.064
POSTSECONDARY SUCCESS I SO

02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:59.269
FOCUSING ON. YEARS OF MATH. IS

02:42:59.336 --> 02:43:01.004
PROBLEMATIC FROM THE

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:07.744
PERSPECTIVE OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAW.

02:43:07.811 --> 02:43:11.414
POLITICS IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED

02:43:11.481 --> 02:43:13.283
THAT POLITICS SHOULD NOT PLAY A

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:18.488
PART IN DECISIONS OF THIS SORT.

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:21.124
OP FRANKLY AS SOMEONE WHO

02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:23.860
TEACHES AT THE INTERSECTION OF

02:43:23.927 --> 02:43:28.498
RULE OF LAW AND POLITICS. I

02:43:28.565 --> 02:43:30.700
FIND THAT A LITTLE NONSENSICAL.

02:43:30.767 --> 02:43:36.773
IF. POLITICS MEANS THAT ELECTED

02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.377
OFFICIALS HAVE A VOICE. THEN

02:43:40.443 --> 02:43:44.648
YOU'RE SAYING. DEMOCRACY ISN'T

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:47.651
SUCH A GOOD IDEA. FOR MAKING

02:43:47.717 --> 02:43:51.087
DECISIONS ABOUT THE POWER

02:43:51.154 --> 02:43:54.724
DYNAMICS IN EDUCATION POLICY.

02:43:54.791 --> 02:43:58.261
OR DECISIONS ABOUT EQUITY.

02:43:58.328 --> 02:44:01.998
THERE MUST BE POLITICS. BUT I

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:02.599
DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.834
POLITICS OF AN ACADEMIC SENATE

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:07.003
THAT'S DRIVING CHOICES OF SENSE

02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:08.972
OF THIS SORT I THINK THE

02:44:09.039 --> 02:44:11.608
LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH IN AT

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:12.209
A MINIMUM BUT YOU SHOULD WEIGH

02:44:12.275 --> 02:44:14.311
IN INFORMALLY. BUT YOU SHOULD

02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:17.747
ALSO CONSIDER. THAT THE CIVIL

02:44:17.814 --> 02:44:18.348
RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE THE EQUITY

02:44:18.415 --> 02:44:21.384
PERSPECTIVE. IS ABSOLUTELY YOUR

02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:25.088
RESPONSIBILITY ABSOLUTELY YOUR

02:44:25.155 --> 02:44:26.456
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:29.659
STATE CONSTITUTION. MAKES THAT

02:44:29.726 --> 02:44:30.193
AN OBLIGATION OF THE STATE

02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:38.535
GOVERNMENT. DIRECTLY. FINALLY

02:44:38.602 --> 02:44:39.903
LET ME JUST SAY THAT I LOVE

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:48.745
MATH. I THINK THAT MATH IS. THE

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:51.648
BEST EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE

02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:57.287
OF GOD OR SOMETHING. I WAS THE

02:44:57.354 --> 02:44:59.789
UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR IN

02:44:59.856 --> 02:45:00.290
MATHEMATICS AND BRIEFLY

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:00.690
CONSIDERED BEING A

02:45:00.757 --> 02:45:03.393
MATHEMATICIAN. IF I COULD MAKE

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:07.330
THE CHOICE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE.

02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:09.766
TEN OR ELEVEN MATH COURSES IN

02:45:09.833 --> 02:45:10.367
HIGH SCHOOL. JUST BECAUSE IT'S

02:45:10.433 --> 02:45:13.069
SO BEAUTIFUL. BUT IT'S NOT MY

02:45:13.136 --> 02:45:18.541
CHOICE I. BUT YOU SHOULD BE

02:45:18.608 --> 02:45:22.879
INVOLVED IN THE CHOICE. THE

02:45:22.946 --> 02:45:25.582
IDEA OF A WAIVER FOR AN

02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:30.620
EXEMPTION. FOR SCHOOLS AND

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:34.724
STUDENTS THAT DON'T. MAKE THE

02:45:34.791 --> 02:45:36.326
Q. R. COURSE READILY AVAILABLE.

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:41.564
I. IS OKAY IF YOU FIRST

02:45:41.631 --> 02:45:44.401
DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS FOURTH

02:45:44.467 --> 02:45:46.636
YEAR IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE

02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:52.442
CS USE. OBJECTIVES OF IMPROVING

02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:56.246
IMPROVING ACADEMIC OUTCOMES.

02:45:56.313 --> 02:45:59.683
BUT EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST WAY.

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:03.019
EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST WAY. THE

02:46:03.086 --> 02:46:04.988
EXEMPTION THAT CSU IS

02:46:05.055 --> 02:46:08.425
CONSIDERING. FIRST OF ALL HAS

02:46:08.491 --> 02:46:10.360
NOT BEEN DEFINED SO WE KNOW

02:46:10.427 --> 02:46:10.894
WHAT IT REALLY IS WHAT THE

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:13.897
STANDARD WOULD BE. SECONDLY

02:46:13.963 --> 02:46:15.265
IT'S NOT IN THE FORMAL

02:46:15.332 --> 02:46:18.301
PROPOSAL. FOR WHAT WILL BE THE

02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:21.037
CHANGE IN THE REGULATIONS. IT'S

02:46:21.104 --> 02:46:24.641
MENTIONED IN STAFF MEMOS. AND

02:46:24.708 --> 02:46:25.275
THIRD IF THERE'S GOING TO BE AN

02:46:25.342 --> 02:46:29.112
EXEMPTION. IT SHOULD BE C. D.

02:46:29.179 --> 02:46:31.381
E. THAT DECIDES THAT MAKES THE

02:46:31.448 --> 02:46:33.917
JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:36.353
COURSE AVAILABILITY IN HIGH

02:46:36.419 --> 02:46:41.124
SCHOOLS. IS SATISFACTORY. LET

02:46:41.191 --> 02:46:42.792
ME STOP THERE I HAVE SOME IDEAS

02:46:42.859 --> 02:46:43.893
ABOUT WHAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:47.564
DO I AND PERHAPS THE BE A

02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:48.131
CHANCE FOR ME TO. TALK ABOUT

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:51.634
THOSE IN THE QUEUE IN A. THIS

02:46:51.701 --> 02:46:52.168
MCCARTY QUESTIONS COMMENTS

02:46:52.235 --> 02:46:56.139
THANK YOU. WELL FIRST THE SOUL

02:46:56.206 --> 02:46:58.908
MATH CHOICE I'M I'M JUST BLOWN

02:46:58.975 --> 02:46:59.542
AWAY BY THAT AND I WANT TO GET

02:46:59.609 --> 02:47:02.278
SIDETRACKED HERE BUT I'M

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:04.814
LOOKING AT THE CSU SHEET HERE

02:47:04.881 --> 02:47:08.284
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT. MY

02:47:08.351 --> 02:47:10.620
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I ONLY

02:47:10.687 --> 02:47:11.221
WENT UP TO PRE ALGEBRA IN HIGH

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:13.823
SCHOOL. AND YOU GOT NO WHERE

02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:17.360
AND I'M- WE'RE OBVIOUSLY BUT

02:47:17.427 --> 02:47:19.229
DON'T TELL ANYBODY BUT I RIGHT

02:47:19.295 --> 02:47:20.397
SHARE HALF OF THE BUDGET FOR

02:47:20.463 --> 02:47:22.265
THE CALIFORNIA THAT EXPLAINS A

02:47:22.332 --> 02:47:23.600
LOT ABOUT THE BUDGET BUT I'M

02:47:23.666 --> 02:47:25.435
REALLY GOOD AT DOING ON THE FLY

02:47:25.502 --> 02:47:28.304
MATHEMATICS WITH MY BASEBALL

02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:28.905
BATTING AVERAGE AND STUFF LIKE

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:31.341
THAT. BUT IT DOES WORK OUT FOR

02:47:31.408 --> 02:47:33.843
SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT I WAS

02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:35.845
GETTING THAT THAT THIS IS A BIG

02:47:35.912 --> 02:47:37.881
ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW. THAT THAT

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:39.682
WAS AN ALLY OF COURSE AND THE

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:41.151
REALITY OF STUDENTS TODAY'S IS

02:47:41.217 --> 02:47:42.485
MUCH MUCH DIFFERENT BUT- THEY

02:47:42.552 --> 02:47:43.820
WOULD JUST ASK YOU JUST BIG

02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:45.855
QUESTION. BIG PICTURE QUESTION

02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:49.192
WHY DO YOU THINK. CSU IS

02:47:49.259 --> 02:47:51.928
PROPOSING THIS INTERVIEW. I

02:47:51.995 --> 02:47:52.729
ASSUME THAT YOU DON'T THINK

02:47:52.796 --> 02:47:54.531
THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE. AND THAT

02:47:54.597 --> 02:47:55.765
THERE HAVE ILL INTENTIONS OF

02:47:55.832 --> 02:47:59.202
HARMING. THE NEXT GENERATION OF

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:00.437
COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WHY DO YOU

02:48:00.503 --> 02:48:02.071
THINK THEY- AND THEIR ACADEMIC

02:48:02.138 --> 02:48:08.178
SENATE. IN THIS POLICY. WELL

02:48:08.244 --> 02:48:09.946
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A COMBINATION OF

02:48:10.013 --> 02:48:11.714
REASONS AND A COMBINATION OF

02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:15.652
MOTIVES AT AT WORK. I'M UP

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:17.320
SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF A

02:48:17.387 --> 02:48:20.323
SENTIMENT THAT'S VERY FAMILIAR

02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:23.760
FOR ACADEMICS FOR FACULTY IS. I

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:26.095
CAN I CAN HAVE MUCH BETTER

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:28.731
STUDENT OUTCOMES IF YOU JUST

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:29.899
GIVE ME BETTER STUDENTS CLEAR.

02:48:29.966 --> 02:48:36.906
SO. THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S

02:48:36.973 --> 02:48:40.610
DRIVING THEIR THEIR JUDGMENT.

02:48:40.677 --> 02:48:41.611
OUR AND IT'S NOT MY

02:48:41.678 --> 02:48:43.480
RESPONSIBILITY AS YOUR UNIVERSE

02:48:43.546 --> 02:48:46.282
TIRED OF DOING REMEDIATION AND

02:48:46.349 --> 02:48:47.250
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S RIGHT OR

02:48:47.317 --> 02:48:49.752
CREATING OTHER COURSES. NOT TO

02:48:49.819 --> 02:48:52.489
MENTION JUST THE QUESTION OF.

02:48:52.555 --> 02:48:54.023
WHO ACTUALLY SHOULD CARRY THE

02:48:54.090 --> 02:48:55.859
BURDEN OF DOING THESE THINGS

02:48:55.925 --> 02:48:58.862
WHICH EACH THINGS IN HIGH

02:48:58.928 --> 02:48:59.395
SCHOOL NOW THAT USED TO BE

02:48:59.462 --> 02:49:01.664
TAUGHT THE COLLEGE. BECAUSE WE

02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:04.334
MADE A JUDGMENT THAT WAS OKAY.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.902
FOR COLLEGES TO SHED THAT

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:06.936
RESPONSIBILITY IF GIVEN THE

02:49:07.003 --> 02:49:09.439
HIGH SCHOOLS. THAT'S ALSO PART

02:49:09.506 --> 02:49:10.640
OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE

02:49:10.707 --> 02:49:12.575
MAKING CLEAR THAT THAT

02:49:12.642 --> 02:49:14.544
ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE TO

02:49:14.611 --> 02:49:16.779
QUANTITATIVE REASONING OR MATH.

02:49:16.846 --> 02:49:18.081
HAVE TO COME FROM HIGH SCHOOLS

02:49:18.147 --> 02:49:19.782
RATHER THAN FROM THE COLLEGES

02:49:19.849 --> 02:49:22.852
AND UNIVERSITIES. I KNOW WHERE

02:49:22.919 --> 02:49:25.188
IS IT WRITTEN IN STONE. WHAT

02:49:25.255 --> 02:49:26.990
THE ENTRY LEVEL CREDIT COURSE

02:49:27.056 --> 02:49:33.496
NEEDS TO BE. I'M. THE THIRD BIG

02:49:33.563 --> 02:49:35.632
THING ABOUT THEIR WHAT THEY'RE

02:49:35.698 --> 02:49:36.232
DOING I THINK IS THAT THEY'RE

02:49:36.299 --> 02:49:38.501
TAKING A SIMPLE CORRELATION.

02:49:38.568 --> 02:49:41.037
NGUYEN EXPOSURE TO MATH. AND

02:49:41.104 --> 02:49:47.343
STUDENT OUTCOMES. REALLY FOR

02:49:47.410 --> 02:49:51.114
PEOPLE MAJOR IN ENGLISH. FOR

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:57.787
PEOPLE WHO MAJOR IN HISTORY. IF

02:49:57.854 --> 02:49:59.455
THERE IS A CORRELATION FACT

02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:04.561
SIMPLY PROVES. THAT MATH TAKING

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:06.829
IS RELATED TO OTHER KINDS OF

02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:08.665
ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:12.235
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THOSE

02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:12.802
OF THE REAL THINGS THAT ARE

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:16.673
DRIVING. THE SUCCESS RATES

02:50:16.739 --> 02:50:18.541
ASSOCIATED WITH MATH

02:50:18.608 --> 02:50:23.580
PREPARATION. YOU WITH ME AS I

02:50:23.646 --> 02:50:26.883
SAID BEFORE. MAP CORPORATION

02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:31.020
FIGHT BUT INCOME AND RACE AND

02:50:31.087 --> 02:50:33.423
GEOGRAPHY OUR FOR MORE FAR MORE

02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:38.895
POWERFUL DRIVERS. I'M. FULL

02:50:38.962 --> 02:50:40.863
STOP OKAY DID YOU EVER AS FOR

02:50:40.930 --> 02:50:42.599
THE CLASS OF FOLLOW UPS BUT

02:50:42.665 --> 02:50:45.668
YEAH I A YEAR I MEAN I AGREE I

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:46.769
WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK IF

02:50:46.836 --> 02:50:49.539
THE LEGISLATURE FUNDED ANOTHER

02:50:49.606 --> 02:50:50.840
FIFTY THOUSAND SPOTS IN THE CAL

02:50:50.907 --> 02:50:52.141
STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I DOUBT

02:50:52.208 --> 02:50:54.210
WE WOULD BE HERE TESTIFYING IN

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:56.679
FRONT OF YOU AROUND AN

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:57.213
ADMISSIONS PROPOSAL THAT'S

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:57.847
CLEARLY GOING TO LEAVE STUDENTS

02:50:57.914 --> 02:51:01.484
OUT. BUT THAT ANSWER LEADS ME

02:51:01.551 --> 02:51:02.118
TO MY NEXT QUESTION FOR BOTH OF

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:04.721
YOU IS THAT. BUT THAT WAS THE

02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:06.723
CASE YOU WOULD YOU COULD SAY

02:51:06.789 --> 02:51:08.057
THAT MAYBE THE STUDENTS WOULD

02:51:08.124 --> 02:51:09.626
ALSO HAVE CHALLENGES WITH

02:51:09.692 --> 02:51:12.562
REMEDIATION. AND STEPPING UP

02:51:12.629 --> 02:51:15.465
NOT BEING ILL PREPARED TO. TAKE

02:51:15.531 --> 02:51:16.165
THE COURSES ARE THERE IN

02:51:16.232 --> 02:51:18.635
FRESHMAN WHICH LEADS TO THREE

02:51:18.701 --> 02:51:22.138
OR FOUR. INCOMES THAT THREE OR

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:22.739
FOUR FOR SIX YEARS AS FAR AS

02:51:22.805 --> 02:51:24.207
THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE

02:51:24.273 --> 02:51:26.442
AND- YOU KNOW STUDENTS THERE'S

02:51:26.509 --> 02:51:27.310
THIS THERE'S A SEVERE

02:51:27.377 --> 02:51:29.245
CONSEQUENCE NOT TALK TO PRESENT

02:51:29.312 --> 02:51:30.346
ALSO ALSO TIME HE TELLS HIS

02:51:30.413 --> 02:51:31.180
INCOMING FRESHMEN THEIR

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:34.050
FAMILIES. WHO WANTS A CHECK FOR

02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:37.520
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALMOST

02:51:37.587 --> 02:51:38.154
FAMILIES RAISE THEIR HAND OKAY

02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:39.589
WELL TO CHOICE IS EASY. YOU

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:40.390
TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS A SEMESTER

02:51:40.456 --> 02:51:42.191
AND NOT TWELVE LIKE YOUR-

02:51:42.258 --> 02:51:43.693
FINANCIAL AID CAL GRANT ADVISER

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.595
TELLS YOU DO. YOU WILL GETA

02:51:45.662 --> 02:51:47.463
CHECK FOR TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND

02:51:47.530 --> 02:51:48.097
DOLLARS ARE CONVERSING OFF TO

02:51:48.164 --> 02:51:49.065
PAY THAT CHECK IN YOUR FAMILY

02:51:49.132 --> 02:51:51.067
YEAR WITH. TUITION HOUSING

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.669
COSTS AND THAT'S A REALITY

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:55.104
ITSELF STUDENTS WHO. AREN'T

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:57.940
THERE MORE THAN LIKELY. GO ON

02:51:58.007 --> 02:52:00.376
NAFTA SPEND MORE TIME IN THE

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:03.179
CSU SYSTEM. SO THE ISSUE THAT I

02:52:03.246 --> 02:52:05.448
ASK THE CSU EARLIER ABOUT THEY

02:52:05.515 --> 02:52:06.582
SAID THAT 91% OF THEIR

02:52:06.649 --> 02:52:10.153
STUDENTS. RT TAKE THE FOR THE

02:52:10.219 --> 02:52:11.788
FOUR YEARS. AND THAT IT'S THE

02:52:11.854 --> 02:52:14.624
IT'S THE- NOT NINE. NINE THE

02:52:14.691 --> 02:52:17.894
STUDENTS ARE ON CAMPUS. WITH

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:18.494
THAT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE ON

02:52:18.561 --> 02:52:19.729
CAMPUS STUDENTS WHO WERE

02:52:19.796 --> 02:52:21.931
ADMITTED TODAY RIGHT CORRECT

02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:23.433
BUT THAT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:25.168
POOL YEAH AND IT SAYS NOTHING

02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:26.736
ABOUT WHO'S IN HIGH SCHOOL I

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:27.603
GUESS TO GO BECAUSE YOU'RE

02:52:27.670 --> 02:52:28.571
ARGUING TWO THINGS YOU'RE

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:29.939
YOU'RE I MEAN YOUR ARGUMENT IS

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:31.507
NOT JUST WHO IS THERE BUT WE

02:52:31.574 --> 02:52:32.675
WANT TO GET MORE STUDENTS

02:52:32.742 --> 02:52:33.342
THERE. WHICH IS YOUR WHOLE

02:52:33.409 --> 02:52:34.744
CAMPAIGN WHICH I GET THAT BUT

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:35.745
LET'S JUST FOCUS STUDENTS TO

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:37.280
SHOW UP ON DAY ONE SO THEY'RE

02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:38.448
SAYING THAT THAT THERE'S NINE

02:52:38.514 --> 02:52:41.417
PERCENT. THAT HADN'T TAKEN

02:52:41.484 --> 02:52:42.618
THOSE FOUR YEARS OF MATH OR

02:52:42.685 --> 02:52:45.955
ADDITIONAL Q. R. COURSES THERE

02:52:46.022 --> 02:52:47.824
DISPROPORTIONATELY IN ENROLLED

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:50.326
IN REMEDIAL OR NEED REMEDIATION

02:52:50.393 --> 02:52:51.494
GRANTED THE REMEDIATION THINGS

02:52:51.561 --> 02:52:53.629
CHANGED. DO YOU DISAGREE WITH

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:57.066
THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT

02:52:57.133 --> 02:52:57.633
THERE'S NO CORRELATION THERE

02:52:57.700 --> 02:53:00.269
SAYING THAT THERE IS. WHAT I'M

02:53:00.336 --> 02:53:02.572
SAYING IS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

02:53:02.638 --> 02:53:04.807
BEING PRESENTED AT THAT THE

02:53:04.874 --> 02:53:07.543
CORRELATION BETWEEN TAKING MATH.

02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:11.814
AND BEING SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE.

02:53:11.881 --> 02:53:18.054
IS CALL VOTE. THE THEORY WOULD

02:53:18.121 --> 02:53:21.057
SUGGEST THAT WHAT CAUSES THE

02:53:21.124 --> 02:53:23.459
IMPACT OF MATH TAKING IS THAT

02:53:23.526 --> 02:53:25.762
IN HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE THERE'S

02:53:25.828 --> 02:53:27.897
BOTH THE AVAILABILITY AND THE

02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:30.099
CULTURE I SUPPORTING MATH

02:53:30.166 --> 02:53:34.137
TAKING. I HAVE LOTS OF OTHER

02:53:34.203 --> 02:53:35.972
BENEFITS I'S GOING TO BE WELL

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:37.940
OVER SOURCED IT'S GOING TO HAVE

02:53:38.007 --> 02:53:41.110
EFFECTIVE TEACHERS I IT'S GOING

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:44.981
TO HAVE LESS. LESS POVERTY IT'S

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:45.515
GOING TO HAVE LESS RACIAL

02:53:45.581 --> 02:53:50.086
ISOLATION. I JUST DON'T THINK

02:53:50.153 --> 02:53:53.122
IT'S THE QUADRATIC EQUATION. I

02:53:53.189 --> 02:53:56.893
THAT IS. LINKED IT CAUSATION

02:53:56.959 --> 02:54:02.665
TERMS. OR THEORETICALLY. I TO

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:06.435
POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. OKAY

02:54:06.502 --> 02:54:07.637
TO SEND YOU TO AN OBJECT RIGHT

02:54:07.703 --> 02:54:09.138
NOW YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU'RE

02:54:09.205 --> 02:54:11.607
SAYING THAT CAUSATION VERSUS

02:54:11.674 --> 02:54:12.175
CORRELATION AND BY GIVEN AT

02:54:12.241 --> 02:54:15.845
FAMILY. WHO'S HAS LIMITED

02:54:15.912 --> 02:54:17.280
RESOURCES A HUNDRED BUCKS LIKE

02:54:17.346 --> 02:54:18.181
TO MAKE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:54:18.247 --> 02:54:18.815
THAT FAMILY THAT KID LITERATE

02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:20.850
BECAUSE COULD HAVE HUNDRED

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:21.450
BUCKS IS THE- PARENT IS GOING

02:54:21.517 --> 02:54:22.084
TO READ THE BOOKS AND ALL THESE

02:54:22.151 --> 02:54:25.488
OTHER. THINGS ARE IN FACT SO I

02:54:25.555 --> 02:54:27.256
GET YOUR- ARGUMENT THERE. IN

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:29.392
YOUR ANALYSIS. MAYBE MY DID

02:54:29.458 --> 02:54:30.393
MAKE SENSE BUT- I THINK YOU

02:54:30.459 --> 02:54:31.694
DON'T I'M TRYING TO SAY. I DID

02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:34.230
OKAY. SO THE WHOLE OPTING OUT

02:54:34.297 --> 02:54:38.167
THING. WHY ONE THAT WORK IF

02:54:38.234 --> 02:54:40.436
THERE IF SEIZE YOU SAYING WE

02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:42.471
GET THE S. THE MAYBE SOME.

02:54:42.538 --> 02:54:44.774
DISTRICTS DONNA PICK ONE

02:54:44.841 --> 02:54:46.375
ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA JUST FOR

02:54:46.442 --> 02:54:48.678
WHATEVER REASON DOESN'T HAVE.

02:54:48.744 --> 02:54:50.012
THE COURSE OFFERINGS WE DON'T

02:54:50.079 --> 02:54:51.881
WANNA HARM THAT STUDENT THEY

02:54:51.948 --> 02:54:53.549
CAN OPT OUT AND THEY'RE SAYING

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:55.751
THE ONLY AFTER ASKED OPT OUT AS

02:54:55.818 --> 02:54:57.854
AN AUTOMATIC OPT OUT. I WANT

02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:00.122
THAT SUFFICE THE OPPOSITION IN

02:55:00.189 --> 02:55:02.725
YOUR ARGUMENTS OF THIS WILL.

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:06.329
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT. A

02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:06.796
CERTAIN STUDENTS AND

02:55:06.863 --> 02:55:07.430
COMMUNITIES UP BECAUSE THE CSU

02:55:07.496 --> 02:55:09.332
HAS FAILED TO BE EXPLICIT ABOUT

02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:10.766
WHAT THIS WAIVER WOULD LOOK

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:12.702
LIKE IT'S NOT. ANYTHING THAT

02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:14.904
WE'VE SEEN IN DETAILED STATUE

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.105
AS THE PROPOSAL IS BEING

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:17.707
FORWARD WERE SUPPOSED TO TRUST

02:55:17.773 --> 02:55:19.108
THAT THE WAIVER IS GOING TO

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.643
WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:23.679
SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY. DON'T DO

02:55:23.746 --> 02:55:25.314
A GREAT JOB AT PROVIDING

02:55:25.381 --> 02:55:27.717
SUFFICIENT ACCESS COUNSELING

02:55:27.783 --> 02:55:29.785
PREPARATION SUPPORT FOR

02:55:29.852 --> 02:55:31.287
STUDENTS TO COMPLETE A THROUGH

02:55:31.354 --> 02:55:34.991
G. COURSES AS IS.

02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:36.893
CLARITY WOULD BE ALL VERY YOU

02:55:36.959 --> 02:55:39.161
KNOW VERY HELPFUL BUT I ALSO

02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:39.896
FEEL LIKE WE'RE HAVING A

02:55:39.962 --> 02:55:42.565
CONVERSATION ABOUT A WAIVER.

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:43.733
WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION

02:55:43.799 --> 02:55:46.469
ABOUT WHETHER IT THIS IS

02:55:46.535 --> 02:55:48.671
CAUSATION OR CORRELATION SO

02:55:48.738 --> 02:55:50.006
ESSENTIALLY WE'RE PUTTING THE

02:55:50.072 --> 02:55:51.574
CART BEFORE THE HORSE I GET

02:55:51.641 --> 02:55:52.742
THAT BUT THERE'S A WILL THERE

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:54.911
WAS AN OPT OUT WHICH YOU THINK

02:55:54.977 --> 02:55:56.479
WAS. A FACT DEVON WHICH WOULD

02:55:56.545 --> 02:55:59.982
BE FAIR WOULD THAT MEAN YOU

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:00.583
WOULDN'T HAVE CONCERNS OF THIS

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:04.520
POLICY. I HAVE CONCERNS WITH

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:05.621
THE POLICY FOR A LOT OF REASONS

02:56:05.688 --> 02:56:07.356
FIRST BECAUSE THERE ISN'T PROOF

02:56:07.423 --> 02:56:08.624
AS CHRIS AT LEE HAS ACTUALLY

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:11.260
UPDATED. THE OPT OUT WITH THE

02:56:11.327 --> 02:56:12.495
OPT OUT IS NOT DEFINED I DON'T

02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:14.430
KNOW LESS AND LESS THE ASSEMBLY

02:56:14.497 --> 02:56:15.464
MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED MORE

02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:17.566
INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAIVER.

02:56:17.633 --> 02:56:20.002
AND IT BEING AUTOMATIC SO THAT

02:56:20.069 --> 02:56:21.337
THEY HAD A CS ON BY NOW SHARED

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:23.105
A LIKE IF THERE IF YOU COULD

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:24.674
CRAFT THE PERFECT OPT OUT

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:27.009
POLICY. WITH THAT MITIGATE THE

02:56:27.076 --> 02:56:29.045
MAJORITY OF THE- YOUR PROBABLY

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:30.613
PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE I DO

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:31.480
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.449
RATIONING AND SORTING TOOL. AND

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:36.052
SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN OPT OUT

02:56:36.118 --> 02:56:37.320
SO IN IT IMAGINE HOW DO YOU

02:56:37.386 --> 02:56:40.389
GUARANTEE THAT. THAT STUDENTS

02:56:40.456 --> 02:56:41.824
TO GET THE WAIVER AN OPT OUT

02:56:41.891 --> 02:56:43.893
AREN'T ACTUALLY IMPACTED BY THE

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.695
POLICY WHEN THERE CONTINUES TO

02:56:45.761 --> 02:56:47.096
BE THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE

02:56:47.163 --> 02:56:49.231
GROWING ELIGIBILITY. RIGHT

02:56:49.298 --> 02:56:49.832
BECAUSE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW

02:56:49.899 --> 02:56:51.133
THAT THEY HAVE TO GET A FOUR

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:54.603
YEAR DEGREE. AND THEY CONTINUE

02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:56.272
TO MEET THE RAISE THE BAR OF A

02:56:56.339 --> 02:56:57.873
THREE G. ACCESSING COMPLETION

02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:00.643
SO. SO NO I WOULD NOT BE

02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:07.149
SATISFIED. OKAY AND THEN WHAT.

02:57:07.216 --> 02:57:07.717
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE REFER

02:57:07.783 --> 02:57:11.153
THEM TO PROVIDE YEAH. I

02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:14.190
APOLOGIZE FOR I'M- I DON'T KNOW

02:57:14.256 --> 02:57:14.790
HOW TO DESIGN. A WAIVER OR AN

02:57:14.857 --> 02:57:19.929
OPT OUT I'M. GOOD AT FINDING

02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:20.563
PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE EXPERT THAN

02:57:20.629 --> 02:57:24.433
I AM. AND I WOULDN'T LOOK TO

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:25.568
SEE AS YOU FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO

02:57:25.634 --> 02:57:27.703
SEE D. E. AND I'D LOOK TO

02:57:27.770 --> 02:57:30.439
INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS. SO NOT

02:57:30.506 --> 02:57:32.975
ONLY DO WE HAVE NO REAL

02:57:33.042 --> 02:57:36.212
CONTENT. TO WHAT THE CRITERION

02:57:36.278 --> 02:57:38.180
WILL BE FOR DECIDING THAT A

02:57:38.247 --> 02:57:41.317
SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T. HAVE

02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:43.019
CAPACITY HAVE THE MEASURE THAT

02:57:43.085 --> 02:57:47.923
OUT BUT. THE WRONG BODY THE

02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:50.960
WRONG PEOPLE ARE DEFINING THAT

02:57:51.027 --> 02:57:54.497
AND IMPLEMENTING IT. I SO AT A

02:57:54.563 --> 02:57:56.365
MINIMUM AT THE SHOULD BE

02:57:56.432 --> 02:58:00.136
SOMETHING IN WHICH I C. D. BABY

02:58:00.202 --> 02:58:02.738
THERE NEED TO BE. WARD

02:58:02.805 --> 02:58:04.807
STANDARDS SHOULD BE MAKING THE

02:58:04.874 --> 02:58:05.941
JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:08.377
SUFFICIENT CAPACITY OKAY AND

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:11.113
THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:12.848
THE DISTRICTS ARE DOING THIS

02:58:12.915 --> 02:58:14.116
AND STAND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:16.652
PANEL IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM MY

02:58:16.719 --> 02:58:19.155
LOCAL DISTRICT IN MY ASSEMBLY

02:58:19.221 --> 02:58:20.689
DISTRICT SUPER EXCITED TO SEE

02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:22.291
HER COME UP HERE. AND I'M NOT

02:58:22.358 --> 02:58:23.726
SURE WHERE SHE'S GONNA COME IN

02:58:23.793 --> 02:58:25.861
ON THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:58:25.928 --> 02:58:28.064
DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING THIS

02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:31.600
AND SOME THAT ARE NOT SO THE

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:32.735
CSU REPRESENTATIVE SAID

02:58:32.802 --> 02:58:34.637
ESSENTIALLY IT'S NOT THAT BIG

02:58:34.703 --> 02:58:36.005
OF A DEAL WITH WHAT THEY

02:58:36.072 --> 02:58:38.941
CURRENTLY HAVE IN THEIR

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:39.508
RESOURCES KNOWING YOU HAVE.

02:58:39.575 --> 02:58:44.246
EIGHT YEARS. TO ROLL THIS OUT

02:58:44.313 --> 02:58:44.880
THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS TO. AND

02:58:44.947 --> 02:58:45.981
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS LOCALLY

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:47.249
STUDENTS WHO ARE IN TWELFTH

02:58:47.316 --> 02:58:48.751
GRADE. AND THEY'VE KEPT

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:49.652
COULDN'T COMPLETED THEIR-

02:58:49.718 --> 02:58:51.520
COMPLETED THEIR OB. GRADUATION

02:58:51.587 --> 02:58:53.923
REQUIREMENTS THEY YOU KNOW THEY

02:58:53.989 --> 02:58:58.360
HAVE HALF DAYS. HOW DO YOU. HOW

02:58:58.427 --> 02:59:00.296
DO YOU RECONCILE THAT THAT SOME

02:59:00.362 --> 02:59:02.031
OF THE LARGER DISTRICTS IN

02:59:02.098 --> 02:59:04.633
CALIFORNIA LARGE POPULATIONS

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:07.236
ARE ARE DOING IT AND IT HASN'T.

02:59:07.303 --> 02:59:09.038
UPSET THE APPLE CART TOO MUCH

02:59:09.105 --> 02:59:11.173
AT ALL OR DO YOU THINK THAT

02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:12.908
THERE ARE HARMS IN THOSE

02:59:12.975 --> 02:59:14.210
DISTRICTS FIRST FOR CERTAIN

02:59:14.276 --> 02:59:15.711
STUDENTS YEAH THANK YOU THAT'S

02:59:15.778 --> 02:59:17.046
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION YOU KNOW

02:59:17.113 --> 02:59:19.348
I'M CERTAINLY NOT A K. TWELVE

02:59:19.415 --> 02:59:20.749
EXPERT BUT I TRUST WHEN I

02:59:20.816 --> 02:59:21.984
TALKED TO SUPERINTENDENT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:24.153
CáC A LOT OF SACRAMENTO. I

02:59:24.220 --> 02:59:25.955
TRUST WHEN I TALKED TO SCHOOL

02:59:26.021 --> 02:59:27.957
BOARD MEMBER AND SCHOOL BOARD

02:59:28.023 --> 02:59:29.325
FORMER SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT

02:59:29.391 --> 02:59:32.128
MONICA GARCIA AND LA AND THEY

02:59:32.194 --> 02:59:34.063
TELL ME ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS

02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:35.364
AROUND THE AVAILABILITY OF MATH

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:37.266
AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. THAT THEY

02:59:37.333 --> 02:59:39.702
ALREADY HAVE TOO MANY POSITIONS

02:59:39.768 --> 02:59:41.971
THAT THEY CAN'T FILL I'M

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:43.506
CONCERNED WHEN THE FIRST TIME

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:44.874
THEY'VE HEARD OF THIS PROPOSAL

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:46.742
IS BECAUSE I'VE TALKED TO THEM

02:59:46.809 --> 02:59:48.777
ABOUT IT OR BECAUSE WE HAVE AS

02:59:48.844 --> 02:59:50.513
A COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS

02:59:50.579 --> 02:59:51.480
ADVOCATES HAVE GONE OUT AND

02:59:51.547 --> 02:59:52.748
TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT. I DON'T

02:59:52.815 --> 02:59:54.783
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY GOOD

02:59:54.850 --> 02:59:56.018
COLLABORATION POLICY THAT LOOK

02:59:56.085 --> 02:59:58.020

RESPECTFULLY EARLIER THEY THEY

03:00:00.456 --> 03:00:01.457

CAPACITY AND PHILANTHROPIC

03:00:27.049 --> 03:00:29.118
SUPPORT. THAT LONG BEACH WAS

03:00:29.185 --> 03:00:31.287
ABLE TO GET IN ORDER TO ELEVATE

03:00:31.353 --> 03:00:33.289
THIS REQUIREMENT FOR AND

03:00:33.355 --> 03:00:34.657
PROVIDE REAL ACCESS TO ALL

03:00:34.723 --> 03:00:37.059

OUT HOW THEY'RE DOING IT. AND

03:00:59.915 --> 03:01:01.350
WHAT WOULD WORK WHEN. THE

03:01:01.417 --> 03:01:01.817
CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE

03:01:01.884 --> 03:01:03.118
ARTICULATING HAVEN'T BEEN HAVE

MEANT VALENTYN THOSE. EXAMPLE

03:01:04.053 --> 03:01:04.887
WELL I THINK THEY'VE BEEN FOUND%

03:01:04.954 --> 03:01:07.289

THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THAT

03:01:24.573 --> 03:01:27.977
FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND A 100%

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:29.345
OF THEIR GRADUATES ARE STILL

03:01:29.411 --> 03:01:31.046
NOT ELIGIBLE SO I THINK

03:01:31.113 --> 03:01:33.249
ASSEMBLY MINUTES SPEAKS TO THE

03:01:33.315 --> 03:01:35.451
VERY REALITY THAT SCHOOL

03:01:35.517 --> 03:01:37.920
DISTRICTS FACE IN TERMS OF

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:40.055
PROVIDING TRUE EQUITABLE ACCESS

03:01:40.122 --> 03:01:41.790
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE COMMITTED TO

03:01:41.857 --> 03:01:43.592
IN A THROUGH G. DEFAULT POLICY.

03:01:43.659 --> 03:01:45.561

TO GO AROUND IN. A CAMPAIGN TO

03:01:49.231 --> 03:01:51.166
RID ELEVATE THIS ISSUE TO

03:01:51.233 --> 03:01:53.469
ARTICULATED THIS IS NOT GOOD

03:01:53.535 --> 03:01:54.870
FOR CERTAIN POPULATION AND

03:01:54.937 --> 03:01:57.072
THERE ARE. A TO BRING BACK UP

03:01:57.139 --> 03:01:59.475
HERE WITH A LISTED QUITE A FEW

03:01:59.541 --> 03:02:00.609
DISTRICTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:02.077
POPULATION I WOULD THINK IT'S

03:02:02.144 --> 03:02:04.246
A- GREAT NUMBER OF THAT.

03:02:04.313 --> 03:02:06.482
OVERALL PUBLISHED IN CALIFORNIA

03:02:06.548 --> 03:02:07.516
THEY FIGURED IT AND WE MISSING

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:10.252
SOMETHING. OR OR IS THIS FEAR

03:02:10.319 --> 03:02:11.420
LIKE YOU SAID THE CHANGE I MEAN

03:02:11.487 --> 03:02:12.888
HE SAID PEOPLE ARE AFRAID I

03:02:12.955 --> 03:02:14.623
LOOK ABOUT CHANGED THIS TO

03:02:14.690 --> 03:02:17.526
PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE AGAINST IT.

03:02:17.593 --> 03:02:20.529
ARE A 100% CERTAIN THE DOWNFALL

03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:22.031
PEOPLE ARE FOR CHANGE ARE

03:02:22.097 --> 03:02:24.066
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THE

03:02:24.133 --> 03:02:27.936
UPSIDE SO WHY WHAT IS CHANGE

03:02:28.003 --> 03:02:28.504
ALWAYS LISTEN WELL FIRST IT

03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:32.207
STATE THAT THAT. THAT'S NOT MY

03:02:32.274 --> 03:02:34.777
POSITION. MY POSITION IS NO

03:02:34.843 --> 03:02:35.411
MORE BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION

03:02:35.477 --> 03:02:39.214
OKAY. SO THAT'S MY LAST

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:39.848
QUESTION ACTUALLY RIGHT HERE NO

03:02:39.915 --> 03:02:40.416
MORE BE SO THERE'S- I COULD

03:02:40.482 --> 03:02:43.452
GIVE YOU FIFTEEN. EMPIRICAL

03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:45.054
QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:47.289
ANSWERED BEFORE POLICY WITH

03:02:47.356 --> 03:02:52.294
THESE HIGH STAKES RISKS. IS SET

03:02:52.361 --> 03:02:55.731
IN AND OUT THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:02:55.798 --> 03:02:56.298
THINGS THAT I WOULD HOPE THE

03:02:56.365 --> 03:03:00.069
COMMITTEE. LET ME AS A MATTER

03:03:00.135 --> 03:03:00.536
OF I HAVE THAT I DON'T

03:03:00.602 --> 03:03:01.203
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW MISTER

03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:02.604
MEDINA HAS SOME QUESTIONS WE

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:04.073
HAVE ONE MORE PANEL THEN PUBLIC

03:03:04.139 --> 03:03:05.574
COMMENT. AND IT'S ALREADY

03:03:05.641 --> 03:03:07.309
GETTING LATE. AND SO MY

03:03:07.376 --> 03:03:11.113
QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT

03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:13.515
THIS IS. A CAB. DO YOU THINK

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:16.318
THIS POLICY. HAS HAS MERIT IT'S

03:03:16.385 --> 03:03:18.420
ABOUT TIMING. COULD YOU TALK

03:03:18.487 --> 03:03:20.789
ABOUT THE ROLLOUT LACK OF

03:03:20.856 --> 03:03:21.657
INFORMATION THE LACK OF K.

03:03:21.724 --> 03:03:25.327
TWELVE. ENGAGE MEN BUILT IN A

03:03:25.394 --> 03:03:28.263
SILO THAT'S ALL GOBBLEDYGOOK

03:03:28.330 --> 03:03:29.765
FOR YOU NOW JUST DO IT NEXT

03:03:29.832 --> 03:03:31.834
YEAR GIVE US TIME AND WE HEAR

03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:33.035
THAT ALL THE TIME UP HERE OR DO

03:03:33.102 --> 03:03:34.069
YOU THINK THIS IS SUCH A

03:03:34.136 --> 03:03:35.771
FATALLY FLAWED PROPOSAL ON THE

03:03:35.838 --> 03:03:37.473
IDEA. THAT WE SHOULD NEVER

03:03:37.539 --> 03:03:39.208
HAPPEN AND THAT IT'S HARD FOR

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:39.808
ME TO GET THAT BECAUSE KNOWING

03:03:39.875 --> 03:03:42.511
THAT. THERE'S OTHER DISTRICTS

03:03:42.578 --> 03:03:44.613
THAT HAVE DONE THIS AND THAT

03:03:44.680 --> 03:03:46.882
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE. HAVING

03:03:46.949 --> 03:03:48.417
CHALLENGES WITH REMEDIAL

03:03:48.484 --> 03:03:50.119
EDUCATION AND THE NEED IF THE

03:03:50.185 --> 03:03:53.956
SAYS AT. AT ELEMENT DECADE

03:03:54.022 --> 03:03:56.125
RECTIFY THAT I WISH WE WERE

03:03:56.191 --> 03:03:57.426
HAVING A CONVERSATION IN

03:03:57.493 --> 03:03:58.761
HEARING FROM THE CSU TO TALK

03:03:58.827 --> 03:04:00.262
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

03:04:00.329 --> 03:04:01.630
INTERNALLY TO IMPROVE

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.265
GRADUATION RATES AND SUPPORT

03:04:03.332 --> 03:04:04.666
THEIR STUDENTS AND THERE'S A

03:04:04.733 --> 03:04:05.467
LOT OF GREAT WORK THAT'S

03:04:05.534 --> 03:04:06.869
HAPPENING AT CAMPUSES TO DO

03:04:06.935 --> 03:04:08.670
THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE

03:04:08.737 --> 03:04:09.671
WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MUCH MORE

03:04:09.738 --> 03:04:11.673
OF OUR TIME AND ENERGY INSTEAD

03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:14.176
OF KICKING THE CAN TO K. TWELVE

03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:15.344
AND SAYING THEY SHOULD DELIVER

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:17.346
BETTER STUDENTS BETTER STUDENTS

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:19.448
BEING VERY SUBJECTIVE TO GET TO

03:04:19.515 --> 03:04:21.583
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION I DON'T

03:04:21.650 --> 03:04:23.752
BELIEVE THAT THIS POLICY. IS

03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:25.421
THE RIGHT POLICY BECAUSE THEY

03:04:25.487 --> 03:04:27.256
HAVEN'T PROVIDED SUFFICIENT

03:04:27.322 --> 03:04:28.490
EVIDENCE IN A PUBLICLY

03:04:28.557 --> 03:04:30.526
TRANSPARENT WAY THAT IT

03:04:30.592 --> 03:04:32.461
ACTUALLY WILL CAUSE THE RESULT

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:34.463
THAT THEY WANT THAT'S ASSUMING

03:04:34.530 --> 03:04:35.964
THAT THE RESULT THAT THEY WANT

03:04:36.031 --> 03:04:37.332
WHICH IS IMPROVED GRADUATION

03:04:37.399 --> 03:04:41.370
RATES. WILL IT THE ONLY WAY OR

03:04:41.437 --> 03:04:42.438
THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS

03:04:42.504 --> 03:04:45.007
THROUGH THIS POLICY AND WITHOUT

03:04:45.073 --> 03:04:47.075
ANY PROOF THAT IT ISN'T GONNA

03:04:47.142 --> 03:04:48.410
HAVE DESPAIRED IMPACT FOR

03:04:48.477 --> 03:04:50.245
STUDENTS OF COLOR AND FOR LOW

03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:51.613
INCOME STUDENTS AND FOR

03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:52.748
STUDENTS IN REGIONS THAT ARE

03:04:52.815 --> 03:04:54.716
ALREADY HAVING A VERY HARD

03:04:54.783 --> 03:04:56.785
TIME. MEETING COLLEGE

03:04:56.852 --> 03:04:58.754
PREPARATION EIGHT THREE G.

03:04:58.821 --> 03:05:03.358
ACCESS FOR OUR STUDENTS. I

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:06.028
THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT.

03:05:06.094 --> 03:05:07.529
CAPACITY PROBLEMS UP AND THEIR

03:05:07.596 --> 03:05:09.198
RELATIONSHIP TO POVERTY AND

03:05:09.264 --> 03:05:13.035
REYES I TO STATE THAT THERE IS

03:05:13.101 --> 03:05:14.436
EVIDENCE THAT THIS KIND OF

03:05:14.503 --> 03:05:16.505
POLICY THAT WOULD CREATE A

03:05:16.572 --> 03:05:19.007
DISPARATE IMPACT BUT WE DON'T

03:05:19.074 --> 03:05:20.175
WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL IT'S

03:05:20.242 --> 03:05:21.810
BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS

03:05:21.877 --> 03:05:23.479
BUT THERE BUT THERE IS RESEARCH

03:05:23.545 --> 03:05:26.415
RIGHT NOW THAT SUGGESTS THAT

03:05:26.482 --> 03:05:28.450
IT'S LIKELY. HAVE A DISPARATE

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:31.920
IMPACT IT IT. I SO THAT REALLY

03:05:31.987 --> 03:05:33.522
DOES MEAN THAT THE BURDEN

03:05:33.589 --> 03:05:37.493
SHOULD BE ON CSU. EITHER

03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:37.926
DEMONSTRATE NOT WITH

03:05:37.993 --> 03:05:40.529
SPECULATION THAT IT WON'T. BUT

03:05:40.596 --> 03:05:42.431
ALSO TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE

03:05:42.498 --> 03:05:47.903
ARE ALTERNATIVE. WAYS TO.

03:05:47.970 --> 03:05:51.874
INCREASED PREPARATION THAT

03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:55.577
DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF. RACIAL

03:05:55.644 --> 03:06:00.215
AND CLASS. ACT THAT MATHEMATICS

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:03.519
DIES BECAUSE OF THE INEQUITIES

03:06:03.585 --> 03:06:04.219
THAT CURRENTLY EXISTING K.

03:06:04.286 --> 03:06:08.891
TWELVE. SO I KNOW THAT'S THOSE

03:06:08.957 --> 03:06:09.758
MY LAST QUESTION BUT YOU YOU'RE

03:06:09.825 --> 03:06:10.592
WATCHING THEM TO YOUR

03:06:10.659 --> 03:06:11.727
CONVEYANCE THAT THERE'S GOING

03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:13.896
TO BE THIS DESPERATE DISPARATE

03:06:13.962 --> 03:06:16.999
IMPACT. AND THAT'S A LEGAL TERM

03:06:17.065 --> 03:06:18.400
AN OBVIOUS YEAR AT BUT YOU KNOW

03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:19.535
WHAT I'M NOT I YEAH I

03:06:19.601 --> 03:06:20.502
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

03:06:20.569 --> 03:06:24.673
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RIGHT RIGHT

03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:29.511
SO IF THE 91% WE SHOP THE CSU

03:06:29.578 --> 03:06:30.646
WITH FOR YEARS ALREADY ARE THE

03:06:30.712 --> 03:06:31.246
SAME ETHNIC BREAK GROUND AS A

03:06:31.313 --> 03:06:33.882
9% BUT HOW DID ABBOTT NEGATIVE

03:06:33.949 --> 03:06:38.053
IMPACT. TO LOOK AT THE CSU

03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:40.255
INCOMING CLASS IT'S VERY VERY

03:06:40.322 --> 03:06:42.224
DIVERSE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND

03:06:42.291 --> 03:06:44.159
ASSUMING THAT THOSE ARE

03:06:44.226 --> 03:06:46.895
DIFFERENT THOSE TWO POPULATIONS.

03:06:46.962 --> 03:06:48.530
HOW IT NEGATIVELY IMPACT IF

03:06:48.597 --> 03:06:49.431
THERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:06:49.498 --> 03:06:51.967
GETTING IN ARE JUST AS BROWN

03:06:52.034 --> 03:06:53.769
AND BLACK AS THE 9% TO GET IN

03:06:53.835 --> 03:06:56.738
AND WHO. HAVE DIFFICULT TIME

03:06:56.805 --> 03:06:58.307
WITH THE REMEDIATION AT THE

03:06:58.373 --> 03:06:59.775
GATE AND THEY NOW HAVE TO IN

03:06:59.841 --> 03:07:01.443
THE YOUNGER THE LITTLE BROTHERS

03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:03.078
AND SISTERS AFTER TAKE THESE

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:03.679
FOURTH FOURTH. HERE OF COURSE

03:07:03.745 --> 03:07:08.984
IS NOT. BOB I THINK THAT IS

03:07:09.051 --> 03:07:12.220
EVIDENCE THAT. IT'S SOME

03:07:12.287 --> 03:07:13.989
EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS NOT A

03:07:14.056 --> 03:07:15.924
DISPARATE IMPACT BUT I THINK

03:07:15.991 --> 03:07:19.361
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG.

03:07:19.428 --> 03:07:19.962
ISSUE WITH THIS IS FOCUSED ON

03:07:20.028 --> 03:07:26.001
ELIGIBILITY. I THEY COULD USING

03:07:26.068 --> 03:07:29.071
WHOLE FILE REVIEW OF MAKE UP

03:07:29.137 --> 03:07:31.506
FOR US Q. IN THE ELIGIBLE

03:07:31.573 --> 03:07:35.210
ELIGIBILITY POOL OF. BASED ON

03:07:35.277 --> 03:07:42.818
THE SUBTLER SUCH MORE SUBTLE HI.

03:07:42.884 --> 03:07:47.556
SCREENING AND. NOT TECHNIQUES

03:07:47.623 --> 03:07:48.757
THAT THEY USED TO BE MORE STOOD

03:07:48.824 --> 03:07:50.726
TO BE TO BE SELECT THAT'S

03:07:50.792 --> 03:07:51.693
THAT'S A HYPOTHESIS WE DON'T

03:07:51.760 --> 03:07:54.129
REALLY KNOW NO NUMBERS THAT'S

03:07:54.196 --> 03:07:56.131
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THAT IS

03:07:56.198 --> 03:07:58.667
WHAT IS PROBLEMATIC WE DON'T

03:07:58.734 --> 03:08:01.103
KNOW THE NUMBERS. AND BEFORE

03:08:01.169 --> 03:08:02.971
THAT FOR MY PURPOSES A

03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:04.573
DESPERATE DESPERATE IMPACT.

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:06.575
ABOUT WHAT THE OUTCOME WELL WE

03:08:06.642 --> 03:08:08.910
KNOW THAT THERE IS A DISPARITY

03:08:08.977 --> 03:08:12.180
ALREADY IN CAPACITY. THAT'S

03:08:12.247 --> 03:08:14.916
RELATED TO POVERTY AND RACE WE

03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:16.418
KNOW THAT ALREADY THAT'S

03:08:16.485 --> 03:08:17.019
EVIDENT THAT'S RESEARCH THAT'S

03:08:17.085 --> 03:08:20.288
BEEN DONE. SO THE MOST LOGICAL

03:08:20.355 --> 03:08:23.492
THING TO BELIEVE AND WE ALSO

03:08:23.558 --> 03:08:23.992
KNOW THAT UNDER RESOURCE

03:08:24.059 --> 03:08:27.429
DISTRICTS. I HAVE MORE TROUBLE

03:08:27.496 --> 03:08:30.966
WITH IMPLEMENTATION. AS A

03:08:31.033 --> 03:08:33.201
GENERAL IMPLEMENTING DOING THE

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:34.803
RIGHT THING WITHOUT CFF

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:35.404
IMPLEMENTING EL CAP I MEAN YOU

03:08:35.470 --> 03:08:38.006
NAME IT. UNDER RESOURCE

03:08:38.073 --> 03:08:40.409
DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY HAVE MORE

03:08:40.475 --> 03:08:45.814
TROUBLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION SO.

03:08:45.881 --> 03:08:46.548
SO WE KNOW THAT IF THE

03:08:46.615 --> 03:08:50.318
ELIGIBILITY POOL. PIGGY BACKS

03:08:50.385 --> 03:08:54.122
OFF OF A SET OF. IT SORT OF

03:08:54.189 --> 03:08:57.459
INEQUITABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. ARE

03:08:57.526 --> 03:08:59.528
I THINK IT IS A VERY REASONABLE

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:01.997
INFERENCE NOT SPECULATION I

03:09:02.064 --> 03:09:04.900
THAT. IT'LL BE TAINTED IN THE

03:09:04.966 --> 03:09:09.004
SAME WAY. AGAIN IF WE'RE

03:09:09.071 --> 03:09:09.604
TALKING ABOUT ELIGIBILITY YOU

03:09:09.671 --> 03:09:12.541
CAN CLEAN IT UP. TO A DEGREE

03:09:12.607 --> 03:09:15.544
WITH WHOLE FILE REVIEW. OKAY

03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:22.651
THANK YOU THANK YOU. A COUPLE

03:09:22.718 --> 03:09:23.785
OF COMMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:26.288
OF QUESTIONS I THINK I HEARD

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:28.090
MISTER MCCARTY SAY THAT HE HAD

03:09:28.156 --> 03:09:28.657
THREE YEARS OF MATH. IN HIGH

03:09:28.724 --> 03:09:33.295
SCHOOL. SOUNDED LIKE ONE POINT

03:09:33.361 --> 03:09:35.430
ONE. THINK ABOUT WHAT ONE OF MY

03:09:35.497 --> 03:09:37.332
LEAST I'VE WON AT LEAST ONE AT

03:09:37.399 --> 03:09:39.134
LEAST ONE. MAYBE YOU MAY WANT

03:09:39.201 --> 03:09:42.871
TO MAYBE TWO MAYBE TWO MAYBE TO

03:09:42.938 --> 03:09:43.438
SOME OF THE FIVE PERCENTER.

03:09:43.505 --> 03:09:47.175
ONLY 5% PEOPLE HAD THAT.

03:09:47.242 --> 03:09:49.344
BACKGROUND SO I WAS THE CALL

03:09:49.411 --> 03:09:49.945
RIGHT THERE WITH YOU OKAY GOOD

03:09:50.011 --> 03:09:52.347
RIGHT TWO OF US. ALGEBRA ONE

03:09:52.414 --> 03:09:56.518
GEOMETRY. THAT WAS IT AS OUR

03:09:56.585 --> 03:09:57.886
FANCY CLASSES FOR ESTIMATES

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.588
THAT WAS IT THAT WAS IT AND

03:09:59.654 --> 03:10:00.922
STILL I WAS ACCEPTED INORDER

03:10:00.989 --> 03:10:02.390
DAME UNIVERSITY PURDUE

03:10:02.457 --> 03:10:04.793
UNIVERSITY AND I'M A GRADUATE

03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:06.795
OF UC RIVERSIDE AND HAVE A

03:10:06.862 --> 03:10:11.099
MASTERS IN HISTORY FROM UC

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:11.700
RIVERSIDE. WITH ONLY THOSE TWO

03:10:11.767 --> 03:10:14.836
YEARS OF MATH. SO I THINK IT IS

03:10:14.903 --> 03:10:17.272
A POINT WELL TAKEN THAT THAT

03:10:17.339 --> 03:10:18.473
FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT GOING

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:22.577
INTO. ENGINEERING SCIENCE YOU

03:10:22.644 --> 03:10:27.082
KNOW. AB THREE YEARS OF MATH

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:29.284
MAY BE ENOUGH AND CERTAINLY MR

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:31.052
MCCARTY AND I DID OKAY WITH

03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:34.589
ONLY. TWO YEARS OF MATH SO I'M

03:10:34.656 --> 03:10:35.891
JUST POINTING THAT OUT I ALSO

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:37.626
WANT TO SHARE YOUR COUPLE

03:10:37.692 --> 03:10:40.662
LETTERS THAT I HAVE ONE IN

03:10:40.729 --> 03:10:42.697
FRONT OF ME HERE FROM THE

03:10:42.764 --> 03:10:43.932
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK

03:10:43.999 --> 03:10:46.301
CAUCUS THE IT SAYS HERE IT'S

03:10:46.368 --> 03:10:47.035
SUBMIT THIS LETTER IN

03:10:47.102 --> 03:10:50.205
OPPOSITION TO CSU PROPOSAL TO

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:51.006
INCREASE ADMISSION

03:10:51.072 --> 03:10:55.110
REQUIREMENTS. SECOND LETTER

03:10:55.177 --> 03:10:56.678
PATRICK O'DONNELL THE CHAIR OF

03:10:56.745 --> 03:10:58.547
EDUCATION HE SAYS I AM

03:10:58.613 --> 03:10:59.714
CONCERNED THAT OUR PUBLIC

03:10:59.781 --> 03:11:01.316
SCHOOLS CURRENTLY LACK THE

03:11:01.383 --> 03:11:04.152
FISCAL AND STAFF RESOURCES TO

03:11:04.219 --> 03:11:05.453
IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED

03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.856
REQUIREMENT. I DO THINK THAT IT

03:11:07.923 --> 03:11:11.459
IS A QUESTION OF INFORMATION

03:11:11.526 --> 03:11:16.264
AND DATA AND CSU. TO MY WAY OF

03:11:16.331 --> 03:11:16.798
LOOKING AT THINGS HAS NOT

03:11:16.865 --> 03:11:20.302
DEMONSTRATED. THAT THIS

03:11:20.368 --> 03:11:23.505
PROPOSAL. IS ONE NEEDED AND I

03:11:23.572 --> 03:11:27.576
THINK TO DOCTOR LEE IS AS YOU

03:11:27.642 --> 03:11:30.846
HAVE INDICATED. THAT THERE

03:11:30.912 --> 03:11:32.180
REALLY IS A CONNECTION ONE BIT

03:11:32.247 --> 03:11:33.415
BETWEEN THE OTHER AND THAT IT

03:11:33.481 --> 03:11:36.852
REALLY IS THAT FORTY YEAR OF

03:11:36.918 --> 03:11:37.385
MAP THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE

03:11:37.452 --> 03:11:37.986
DIFFERENCE THAT IS NOT

03:11:38.053 --> 03:11:41.022
SOMETHING ELSE. SO THANK YOU

03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:42.324
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION A COUPLE

03:11:42.390 --> 03:11:45.260
QUESTIONS IF YOU HAD ANY

03:11:45.327 --> 03:11:48.063
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PROPOSAL

03:11:48.129 --> 03:11:50.565
WHAT WOULD THEY BE TO MAKE IT

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:55.871
MORE ACCEPTABLE. TO YOU IF ANY.

03:11:55.937 --> 03:11:56.404
WHY I THINK OUR OUR BROAD

03:11:56.471 --> 03:11:57.672
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE

03:11:57.739 --> 03:11:59.007
SHOULD HAVE BE WE SHOULD BE

03:11:59.074 --> 03:12:00.609
HAVING A BROADER CONVERSATION

03:12:00.675 --> 03:12:01.676
AROUND COLLEGE AGILE

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:03.812
ELIGIBILITY I THINK DATA

03:12:03.879 --> 03:12:06.214
TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN RAISED

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:08.617
SEVERAL TIMES. INDEPENDENT DATA

03:12:08.683 --> 03:12:11.052
TRANSPARENCY TO REALLY ANALYZE

03:12:11.119 --> 03:12:12.854
A DESPAIRED IMPACT AND REAL

03:12:12.921 --> 03:12:16.524
COORDINATION WITH K. TWELVE TO

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:18.560
INSURE THE POSSIBILITY THAT

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:21.930
EVEN SIX YEARS IS AN

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:22.464
APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME FOR

03:12:22.530 --> 03:12:26.301
IMPLEMENTATION. THE NEXT

03:12:26.368 --> 03:12:26.868
QUESTION AND I ONLY HAVE A

03:12:26.935 --> 03:12:28.570
COUPLE MORE DO YOU THINK THE

03:12:28.637 --> 03:12:30.005
pSTATE SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH

03:12:30.071 --> 03:12:32.207
THE LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

03:12:32.274 --> 03:12:32.774
WHO WERE ONLY TAKING TWO OR

03:12:32.841 --> 03:12:35.577
THREE YEARS OF MATH. AND IF NOT

03:12:35.644 --> 03:12:38.613
HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS. THE

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:39.147
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

03:12:39.214 --> 03:12:41.216
TAKING TWO OR THREE YEARS OF

03:12:41.283 --> 03:12:41.816
MATH. OTHER THAN THE PROPOSAL

03:12:41.883 --> 03:12:46.421
THAT THERE. PROPOSING. IF THIS

03:12:46.488 --> 03:12:49.658
WERE GOING TO GO FORWARD. I

03:12:49.724 --> 03:12:51.493
THINK IT SHOULD BE CSU

03:12:51.559 --> 03:12:53.428
PERSUADING THE STATE BOARD OF

03:12:53.495 --> 03:12:53.828
EDUCATION AND THE

03:12:53.895 --> 03:12:58.867
SUPERINTENDENT. TO CHANGE HIGH

03:12:58.934 --> 03:12:59.334
SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND

03:12:59.401 --> 03:13:02.671
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S

03:13:02.737 --> 03:13:03.238
THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THIS IF

03:13:03.305 --> 03:13:07.142
IT'S GOING TO BE DOT. IT STILL

03:13:07.208 --> 03:13:07.776
DOESN'T ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF

03:13:07.842 --> 03:13:13.882
WHETHER. QUANTITATIVE REASONING

03:13:13.949 --> 03:13:14.416
IS THE BEST WAY TO IMPROVE

03:13:14.482 --> 03:13:16.818
STUDENT OUTCOMES. THEY OUGHT TO

03:13:16.885 --> 03:13:22.457
LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES. I AM NOT.

03:13:22.524 --> 03:13:25.293
MR BUT JUST LET ME LET LET LET

03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:26.328
ME LET ME STOP THERE. SO I

03:13:26.394 --> 03:13:30.198
WOULD. SO THE MAIN CHANGE I

03:13:30.265 --> 03:13:32.400
WOULD MAKE IN THE IN THE IN THE

03:13:32.467 --> 03:13:34.402
PROPOSAL AS IT'S WRITTEN AND IT

03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:36.805
MAY BE ON THE LEGISLATION COULD

03:13:36.871 --> 03:13:40.842
ACCOMPLISH THIS IS REQUIRE THAT

03:13:40.909 --> 03:13:46.181
THE- EXEMPTION. BE DEFINED AND

03:13:46.247 --> 03:13:49.617
IMPLEMENTED BY CD. RATHER THAN

03:13:49.684 --> 03:13:51.152
THE CSU ACADEMIC FACULTY.

03:13:51.219 --> 03:13:55.023
ACADEMICS AND. AND MY LAST

03:13:55.090 --> 03:13:58.426
QUESTION TO MICHELLE. IN NOT

03:13:58.493 --> 03:14:02.097
SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL. WHAT

03:14:02.163 --> 03:14:04.265
ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE THE CSU

03:14:04.332 --> 03:14:07.802
TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES.

03:14:07.869 --> 03:14:10.505
WELL I THINK OF YOU KNOW CS USE

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:14.042
GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS BEEN

03:14:14.109 --> 03:14:17.278
A REALLY EXCELLENT NORTHSTAR IT

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:19.114
HAS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT

03:14:19.180 --> 03:14:20.715
BY THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE AND

03:14:20.782 --> 03:14:22.717
THEIR LEADERSHIP AT THE VALUE

03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:24.052
OF IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES

03:14:24.119 --> 03:14:25.353
AND I THINK MOST OF YOU SAW

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:26.988
THAT YOU KNOW WONDERFUL NEWS

03:14:27.055 --> 03:14:28.356
THAT THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION

03:14:28.423 --> 03:14:30.358
RATE HAS INCREASED AS HAS THE

03:14:30.425 --> 03:14:32.427
SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. I

03:14:32.494 --> 03:14:33.962
THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY

03:14:34.029 --> 03:14:36.031
TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VERY

03:14:36.097 --> 03:14:37.499
REAL REALITY AROUND COUNSELING

03:14:37.565 --> 03:14:39.467
AND GUIDANCE RIGHT ENSURING

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:40.535
THAT STUDENTS KNOW THAT FULL

03:14:40.602 --> 03:14:42.504
TIME ENROLLMENT TO GRADUATE IN

03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:44.472
FOUR YEARS IS FIFTEEN AND NOT

03:14:44.539 --> 03:14:45.740
TWELVE EVEN THOUGH YOU GET FULL

03:14:45.807 --> 03:14:47.509
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGING AT

03:14:47.575 --> 03:14:49.210
TWELVE UNITS. WE KNOW THAT

03:14:49.277 --> 03:14:50.979
SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAMS AT CAL

03:14:51.046 --> 03:14:52.047
STATE SAN BERNARDINO ARE

03:14:52.113 --> 03:14:54.282
INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE WE KNOW

03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:55.283
THAT THE ELIMINATION OF

03:14:55.350 --> 03:14:57.052
REMEDIAL AT COURSES HAS HAD

03:14:57.118 --> 03:14:58.586
HUGE SUCCESS WITH STUDENTS WHO

03:14:58.653 --> 03:15:01.489
WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED REMEDIAL

03:15:01.556 --> 03:15:02.891
WE ALSO KNOW THE CAL STATE

03:15:02.957 --> 03:15:04.325
DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS DONE A GOOD

03:15:04.392 --> 03:15:07.629
JOB OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO STEM

03:15:07.695 --> 03:15:09.731
ART COURSES FOR STUDENTS OF

03:15:09.798 --> 03:15:11.099
COLOR AND GETTING THEM TO

03:15:11.166 --> 03:15:13.101
SUCCEED IN THOSE PATHWAYS. I

03:15:13.168 --> 03:15:14.769
THINK THE CSU PROBABLY IS A

03:15:14.836 --> 03:15:16.938
BETTER EXPERT AT A LOT OF THE

03:15:17.005 --> 03:15:19.074
DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT THEY

03:15:19.140 --> 03:15:21.009
ARE ALREADY PUTTING INTO PLACE

03:15:21.076 --> 03:15:23.878
I WOULD MY ADVICE TO THE CSU IS

03:15:23.945 --> 03:15:25.980
TO FOCUS AND DOUBLE DOWN ON ALL

03:15:26.047 --> 03:15:27.215
OF THOSE EFFORTS AND

03:15:27.282 --> 03:15:30.285
INITIATIVES THE IDEA. THAT WE

03:15:30.351 --> 03:15:35.390
SHOULD. THE IDEA THAT THE

03:15:35.457 --> 03:15:37.225
BIGGEST SOLUTION SHOULD BE

03:15:37.292 --> 03:15:39.994
AROUND THE INCOMING STUDENTS.

03:15:40.061 --> 03:15:42.797
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON WHAT THE

03:15:42.864 --> 03:15:44.365
INSTITUTION CAN CONTROL AND

03:15:44.432 --> 03:15:45.834
SHOULD DO TO BETTER SERVE ITS

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:48.236
STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO

03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:51.506
SEE GRADUATION NUMBERS GO UP

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:52.707
BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF

03:15:52.774 --> 03:15:54.242
CONTINUING TO LEAVE MORE

03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:55.977
STUDENTS BEHIND AND LEAVE THEM

03:15:56.044 --> 03:15:57.679
OUT. ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE

03:15:57.745 --> 03:15:59.581
STUDENTS TYPICALLY TEND TO BE

03:15:59.647 --> 03:16:02.584

CAREFUL DEMOGRAPHICS I THINK IT

03:19:16.044 --> 03:19:18.112
WILL HELP PAINT A KIND OF. A

03:19:18.179 --> 03:19:19.580

UNDER REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION.

03:19:38.299 --> 03:19:40.068
FOR MY COLLEAGUES IS HOW DO WE

03:19:40.134 --> 03:19:41.369
HAVE TO MAINTAIN. A HIGH

03:19:41.436 --> 03:19:42.837
COLLEGE GOING CULTURES WHILE

03:19:42.904 --> 03:19:45.039
SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING THAT

03:19:45.106 --> 03:19:47.742
ENTRY INTO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE

03:19:47.809 --> 03:19:48.309
SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL

03:19:48.376 --> 03:19:50.712
CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS. THIS IS

03:19:50.778 --> 03:19:52.447
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN TITLE

03:19:52.513 --> 03:19:53.014
ONE ARE HIGH POVERTY SCHOOL

03:19:53.081 --> 03:19:56.617
DISTRICTS. THE COLLEGE GOING

03:19:56.684 --> 03:19:58.119
FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN MADE AYE

03:19:58.186 --> 03:19:59.754
BUNDLING CLEAR WITH THE

03:19:59.821 --> 03:20:02.357
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD.

03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:03.725
WHICH IS CALIFORNIANS NEW

03:20:03.791 --> 03:20:05.093
DISTRICT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

03:20:05.159 --> 03:20:06.227
AND I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE

03:20:06.294 --> 03:20:08.162
OF THAT BUT AFTER HIGHLIGHTS

03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:09.497
AND TRACKS PROGRESS MADE BY

03:20:09.564 --> 03:20:10.898
DISTRICTS TOWARDS COLLEGE AND

03:20:10.965 --> 03:20:12.233
CAREER READINESS. AND WE'VE

03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:14.535
USED THE A TO G. REQUIREMENT AS

03:20:14.602 --> 03:20:18.206
THAT TRACKING ADVICE AS WELL AS

03:20:18.272 --> 03:20:18.773
ENTRY COMPLETION OF COLLAGEN

03:20:18.840 --> 03:20:22.443
GRIP PATHWAYS. HEALTHY OF OUR

03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:23.511
STATURE DRIVER REQUIRES THAT WE

03:20:23.578 --> 03:20:25.046
CONTINUOUSLY WORK TOWARDS

03:20:25.113 --> 03:20:26.314
CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:29.283
BETWEEN SUB GROUPS. AND TO

03:20:29.350 --> 03:20:29.851
ENSURE EQUITY FOR ALL THINGS

03:20:29.917 --> 03:20:32.720
WITHIN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM.

03:20:32.787 --> 03:20:34.122
NEW TO THIS ACCOUNT A FRAMEWORK

03:20:34.188 --> 03:20:34.689
AS IDENTIFICATION SINCE IN

03:20:34.756 --> 03:20:36.224
FOSTER CARE AT THE SUB GROUP A

03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:37.625
GROUP THAT I BELIEVE WILL MAY

03:20:37.692 --> 03:20:38.893
BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE

03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:40.795
CSU PROPOSAL. I ALSO AM

03:20:40.862 --> 03:20:41.562
CONCERNED THAT STUDENTS WITH

03:20:41.629 --> 03:20:43.231
SIMILAR DEMOGRAPHICS AS FOSTER

03:20:43.297 --> 03:20:45.433
YOUTH WILL SUFFER THE SAME

03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:47.635
CHALLENGES AS MENTIONED EARLIER.

03:20:47.702 --> 03:20:49.337
IT CONCERNS ME THAT THIS NEW

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:49.804
PROPOSAL WILL FURTHER

03:20:49.871 --> 03:20:51.839
EXACERBATE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

03:20:51.906 --> 03:20:53.508
AND POSSIBLY UNDERMINE CURRENT

03:20:53.574 --> 03:20:54.709
EFFORTS TOWARDS TOWARDS

03:20:54.776 --> 03:20:56.644
EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. WHICH AGAIN

03:20:56.711 --> 03:20:58.312
AS A DRIVER OF OUR STATUTORY

03:20:58.379 --> 03:21:01.382
OBLIGATIONS TO OUR SIX POINT

03:21:01.449 --> 03:21:01.883
TWO SIX SIX SIX ONE FOUR

03:21:01.949 --> 03:21:04.485
MILLION STUDENTS. THE OTHER

03:21:04.552 --> 03:21:05.620
QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:21:05.686 --> 03:21:07.054
UNPACKED IS WHETHER SOLELY IT

03:21:07.121 --> 03:21:08.389
ADDING A YEAR A QUANTITATIVE

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:10.024
REASONING IS REALLY GOING TO

03:21:10.091 --> 03:21:12.326
ENSURE MATRICULATION A

03:21:12.393 --> 03:21:12.960
GRADUATION AND HIRING AD WHICH

03:21:13.027 --> 03:21:14.829
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE. A

03:21:14.896 --> 03:21:15.730
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR

03:21:15.797 --> 03:21:16.631
STUDENTS WHO COME FROM

03:21:16.697 --> 03:21:17.832
DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS

03:21:17.899 --> 03:21:20.334
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED FALL

03:21:20.401 --> 03:21:20.935
STREET HOMELESS YOUTH SPECIAL

03:21:21.002 --> 03:21:22.937
NEEDS STUDENTS AND OTHERS. IF

03:21:23.004 --> 03:21:23.805
YOU DON'T MIND I'M GONNA TAKE A

03:21:23.871 --> 03:21:25.139
LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THE

03:21:25.206 --> 03:21:27.241
DATA. FROM AT THAT YOU CAN DATE

03:21:27.308 --> 03:21:28.643
OF STUDENTS IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:21:28.709 --> 03:21:29.544
OUTLINE THE WORK THE CABLE

03:21:29.610 --> 03:21:31.479
SYSTEMS HAVE TO DO TO ACTUALLY.

03:21:31.546 --> 03:21:33.014
MEET THE GOALS OF THE DASHBOARD

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:34.649
AND THE INTENTIONS OF THE LOCAL

03:21:34.715 --> 03:21:35.716
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AGAIN

03:21:35.783 --> 03:21:37.819
OUR STATUTORY DRIVERS. THE HELP

03:21:37.885 --> 03:21:40.988
CLOSE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. ARE

03:21:41.055 --> 03:21:44.659
THE EDUCATIONAL EQUITY GAP. SO

03:21:44.725 --> 03:21:45.393
DO THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES AND

03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:46.260
FROM MY EXPERIENCE TO STUDENTS

03:21:46.327 --> 03:21:47.395
IN FOSTER CARE OFTEN AT AND ON

03:21:47.462 --> 03:21:49.864
AN ACADEMIC AND DISADVANTAGED.

03:21:49.931 --> 03:21:51.632
WHICH IS OFTEN EXACERBATED BY

03:21:51.699 --> 03:21:52.200
THE EXTREMELY HIGH SCHOOL

03:21:52.266 --> 03:21:54.402
MOBILITY OR TRANSFER RATES.

03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:55.770
THEY ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY

03:21:55.837 --> 03:21:57.672
AFTER TO TRANSFER SCHOOLS OF AN

03:21:57.738 --> 03:22:00.007
ACADEMIC YEAR COMPARED TO THEIR

03:22:00.074 --> 03:22:03.444
PEERS. ACROSS THE AND ACROSS

03:22:03.511 --> 03:22:04.078
THE BOARD THEY ARE STILL IN THE

03:22:04.145 --> 03:22:05.079
RED CATEGORY AND ACADEMIC

03:22:05.146 --> 03:22:07.615
ACHIEVEMENT. MEANING THAT THEY

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:08.115
ARE FAR FROM STANDARD IN

03:22:08.182 --> 03:22:10.518
ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH.

03:22:10.585 --> 03:22:12.186
FOR MATH SPECIFICALLY THEY ARE

03:22:12.253 --> 03:22:13.387
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POINTS

03:22:13.454 --> 03:22:15.323
BELOW STANDARD. SO AGAIN IT

03:22:15.389 --> 03:22:16.958
PAINS KIND OF THE WORK THAT WE

03:22:17.024 --> 03:22:18.960
HAVE TO DO AN AN LVF POSSE THAT

03:22:19.026 --> 03:22:21.362
IDENTIFIED SUBGROUP. AND WE

03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.963
HAVE A STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO

03:22:22.029 --> 03:22:25.166
THEM. THEY ARE THE THEY ARE THE

03:22:25.233 --> 03:22:26.167
LOWEST BUT THEY HAVE THE LOWEST

03:22:26.234 --> 03:22:27.802
PERFORMANCE IN MEETING COLLEGE

03:22:27.869 --> 03:22:28.803
AND CAREER READY AS INDICATORS

03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:31.272
AT ONLY TEN POINT FOUR PERCENT.

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:32.073
OF THEIR STUDENT POPULATION

03:22:32.139 --> 03:22:33.040
THAT ACTUALLY MEET THAT

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:35.142
INDICATOR. ONLY BE TO BE BEAT

03:22:35.209 --> 03:22:38.045
BY. SAYS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL

03:22:38.112 --> 03:22:43.384
NEEDS AT NINE POINT 2% SO ALL

03:22:43.451 --> 03:22:44.952
ALL OTHER STUDENTS ARE AT FORTY

03:22:45.019 --> 03:22:46.320
TWO POINT 2% PREPARED. THAT

03:22:46.387 --> 03:22:47.722
MEANS THAT STUDENT FOSTER'S

03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:49.023
FOUR TIMES LESS LIKELY THAN

03:22:49.090 --> 03:22:51.359
THEIR NON FOSTER COMFORT TO

03:22:51.425 --> 03:22:51.959
MEET THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR

03:22:52.026 --> 03:22:56.497
COLLEGE. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS

03:22:56.564 --> 03:22:57.431
THAT THERE IS A STRONGER

03:22:57.498 --> 03:22:58.733
LIKELIHOOD THAT FOSTER IT WAS

03:22:58.799 --> 03:23:01.969
RECEIVED A DEGREE IF THEY'D A

03:23:02.036 --> 03:23:02.537
DIRECTLY AND ROLL AND A FOUR

03:23:02.603 --> 03:23:03.104
YEAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY.

03:23:03.170 --> 03:23:07.074
RIGHT. ADDING THIS ADDITIONAL

03:23:07.141 --> 03:23:08.543
YEAR OF MATH AND QUANTITATIVE

03:23:08.609 --> 03:23:09.944
REASONING DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE

03:23:10.011 --> 03:23:11.078
THE CHALLENGES THAT STUDENTS IN

03:23:11.145 --> 03:23:12.146
THESE SITUATIONS HAVE TO

03:23:12.213 --> 03:23:13.281
OVERCOME TO JUST MEET THE

03:23:13.347 --> 03:23:15.583
CURRENT REQUIREMENTS AND HOW IT

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:17.184
IMPACTS ACCESSIBILITY FOR

03:23:17.251 --> 03:23:18.119
STUDENTS TO WHOM THE STATE HAS

03:23:18.185 --> 03:23:19.887
THE UNIQUE OBLIGATION HAVING

03:23:19.954 --> 03:23:22.590
REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES

03:23:22.657 --> 03:23:23.124
AND FOR WHOM THE STATE HAS

03:23:23.190 --> 03:23:23.524
TAKEN ON PARENTAL

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:26.160
RESPONSIBILITIES. THANKS AFFECT

03:23:26.227 --> 03:23:27.328
THE SUCCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION

03:23:27.395 --> 03:23:28.863
GRADUATION IS OFTEN DUE TO THE

03:23:28.930 --> 03:23:30.331
SUPPORTS PROVIDED VIA TARGETED

03:23:30.398 --> 03:23:33.134
STAMP PROGRAMS LIKE ETHIOPIA.

03:23:33.200 --> 03:23:34.835
E. O. APS GUARDIANS COLLARS AND

03:23:34.902 --> 03:23:36.671
THE LIKE. THIS RESEARCH

03:23:36.737 --> 03:23:38.339
INDICATES THAT THESE TYPES OF

03:23:38.406 --> 03:23:39.340
TARGETED STUDENT SUPPORT

03:23:39.407 --> 03:23:40.207
PROGRAMS HAVE ALLOWED HIM TO

03:23:40.274 --> 03:23:43.578
PROSPER AND OTHER STUDENTS WITH

03:23:43.644 --> 03:23:44.111
SOME EXPENSE TO THRIVE IN

03:23:44.178 --> 03:23:46.581
HIGHER EDUCATION AND COMPLETE.

03:23:46.647 --> 03:23:47.615
DEGREES NOW THAT ASIDE THEY'RE

03:23:47.682 --> 03:23:49.250
ACTUALLY LARGER CONCERNS THAT

03:23:49.317 --> 03:23:50.785
ARE BROUGHT TO LIGHT WITH

03:23:50.851 --> 03:23:51.719
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT AND

03:23:51.786 --> 03:23:53.754
ALTHOUGH DISTRICT LIKE OURS.

03:23:53.821 --> 03:23:55.222
HAS TWENTY NINE COURSES WHO

03:23:55.289 --> 03:23:58.259
COULD MEET THIS OTHERS DO NOT.

03:23:58.326 --> 03:24:03.431
FROM. HOW DOES NOT HAVE

03:24:03.497 --> 03:24:05.032
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OFTEN NOT

03:24:05.099 --> 03:24:07.935
REQUIRED TACTIC SHIFT RESOURCES

03:24:08.002 --> 03:24:08.536
EVEN OPEN THE LAID EMPLOYMENT

03:24:08.603 --> 03:24:10.171
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE.

03:24:10.237 --> 03:24:11.872
SPECIFICALLY WITH AN INEVITABLE

03:24:11.939 --> 03:24:13.207
RECESSION ON THE HORIZON AS

03:24:13.274 --> 03:24:15.309
INDICATED BY THE ECONOMIC

03:24:15.376 --> 03:24:17.411
INDICATOR SHARED BY THE LA JOH

03:24:17.478 --> 03:24:19.780
INVERTED YIELD SCORES LOW GDP.

03:24:19.847 --> 03:24:21.382
THE BUSINESS CYCLE ABOUT TO END

03:24:21.449 --> 03:24:21.983
RIGHT AND THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

03:24:22.049 --> 03:24:25.353
SORRY. AS SOMEONE MCCARTY

03:24:25.419 --> 03:24:28.456
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHAIR THIS.

03:24:28.522 --> 03:24:30.625
HOW IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW

03:24:30.691 --> 03:24:31.826
AND WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:24:31.892 --> 03:24:33.794
DISTRICTS WILL FIND THE

03:24:33.861 --> 03:24:34.328
FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ADD

03:24:34.395 --> 03:24:36.897
ADDITIONAL COURSES. THIS IS

03:24:36.964 --> 03:24:38.432
ESPECIALLY TRUE OF SMALL WORLD

03:24:38.499 --> 03:24:40.668
OF STRENGTH WHO HAVE LIMITED

03:24:40.735 --> 03:24:41.569
TEACHING FACULTY TO MEET THE

03:24:41.636 --> 03:24:43.471
CURRENT CSU REQUIREMENTS.

03:24:43.537 --> 03:24:45.172
ALTHOUGH WAIVER PROPOSAL HAS

03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:45.973
BEEN PUT FORTH FOR

03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:47.742
CONSIDERATION THIS WAIVER

03:24:47.808 --> 03:24:49.076
PROCESS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL

03:24:49.143 --> 03:24:49.977
BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGES BOTH

03:24:50.044 --> 03:24:51.646
FOR K. TWELVE OUR ADVISORS AND

03:24:51.712 --> 03:24:53.247
I MATCH IN THE CSU SYSTEM IF IT

03:24:53.314 --> 03:24:54.348
ISN'T REALLY STREAMLINED AN%

03:24:54.415 --> 03:24:56.484
AUTOMATIC. IT SEEMS THAT THE

03:24:56.550 --> 03:24:57.752
WAIVER WOULD ALSO CREATE A

03:24:57.818 --> 03:25:00.254
MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF

03:25:00.321 --> 03:25:00.821
ELIGIBILITY WHICH COULD. BE

03:25:00.888 --> 03:25:04.325
PROBLEMATIC. ALTHOUGH CSU HAS

03:25:04.392 --> 03:25:05.259
COMMITTED ONE TIME TEN MILLION

03:25:05.326 --> 03:25:05.760
OVER THREE YEARS TO HELP

03:25:05.826 --> 03:25:06.227
BOLSTER THE SHRINKING

03:25:06.293 --> 03:25:08.462
POPULATION OF K. TWELVE. STEM

03:25:08.529 --> 03:25:09.930
TEACHERS IT IS UNLIKE IT IS

03:25:09.997 --> 03:25:11.365
LIKELY NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO

03:25:11.432 --> 03:25:12.566
ADDRESS ADDRESS THE GAP THAT IS

03:25:12.633 --> 03:25:14.368
REQUIRED TO MEET THE CURRENT

03:25:14.435 --> 03:25:15.703
CURRICULUM NEEDS. MUCH LESS TO

03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:17.038
BUY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF

03:25:17.104 --> 03:25:20.341
QUANTITATIVE REASONING AND OVER

03:25:20.408 --> 03:25:20.941
THIRTEEN HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS

03:25:21.008 --> 03:25:21.542
AND SEVEN HUNDRED ALTERNATIVE

03:25:21.609 --> 03:25:23.611
EDUCATION SCHOOLS. AS I

03:25:23.678 --> 03:25:24.712
DISCUSSED THIS WITH SEVERAL

03:25:24.779 --> 03:25:25.780
COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

03:25:25.846 --> 03:25:27.248
THEY ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS

03:25:27.314 --> 03:25:28.482
WAS HAPPENING SO THE SHOCK TO A

03:25:28.549 --> 03:25:30.384
LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES BOARD

03:25:30.451 --> 03:25:33.421
MEMBERS SUPERINTENDENTS. THEY

03:25:33.487 --> 03:25:38.292
WERE. THE REASON FOR THE KEY

03:25:38.359 --> 03:25:39.660
QUANTITY REASON PROPOSAL IS

03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:41.529
UNCLEAR IF THERE IS A BELIEF

03:25:41.595 --> 03:25:43.998
THAT Q. R. IS WHAT CAN INCREASE

03:25:44.065 --> 03:25:46.333
MATRICULATION GRADUATION THEN

03:25:46.400 --> 03:25:47.368
WHY COULD VENN COULD

03:25:47.435 --> 03:25:49.837
QUANTITATIVE REASONING THE ONE

03:25:49.904 --> 03:25:52.740
OF THE OPTIONAL MATH OR SCIENCE

03:25:52.807 --> 03:25:53.374
REQUIREMENTS. ADOPTED IN WITHIN

03:25:53.441 --> 03:25:55.710
THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK. AS I

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:56.477
UNDERSTAND IT FROM COLLEAGUES

03:25:56.544 --> 03:25:57.845
WHO ARE IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT

03:25:57.912 --> 03:25:59.313
HIGH SCHOOL MATH ACTUALLY NOT

03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:00.848
SEQUENTIAL WRITE SO DOESN'T GO

03:26:00.915 --> 03:26:03.184
FROM. ALGEBRA ALGEBRA TO

03:26:03.250 --> 03:26:04.752
GEOMETRY TO TRICK YOU CAN

03:26:04.819 --> 03:26:06.487
ACTUALLY FOLD IN A QUANTITATIVE

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:08.756
REASONING COURSE AND SO IT'S

03:26:08.823 --> 03:26:09.323
NOT SEQUENTIAL AND THAT AND

03:26:09.390 --> 03:26:13.994
THAT METHOD. THAT THAT OPTION

03:26:14.061 --> 03:26:15.996
WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE RESOLVED

03:26:16.063 --> 03:26:16.964
IN ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH

03:26:17.031 --> 03:26:18.632
SEEM TO BE A BIT LIMITED IN

03:26:18.699 --> 03:26:20.067
SCOPE. ONLY FOCUSING ON MATH

03:26:20.134 --> 03:26:21.368
AND QUANTITATIVE REASONING WELL

03:26:21.435 --> 03:26:23.137
THEY COULD BE THERE COULD BE

03:26:23.204 --> 03:26:24.371
OTHER SEEN BEHAVIORS THAT MAY

03:26:24.438 --> 03:26:25.873
HAVE ALSO SHOWN HYBRID

03:26:25.940 --> 03:26:27.842
MATRICULATION GRADUATION RATES.

03:26:27.908 --> 03:26:29.176
I A PERHAPS COMPLETION OF

03:26:29.243 --> 03:26:31.645
ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES OR

03:26:31.712 --> 03:26:32.213
ANYTHING ELSE WITH THAT WAS

03:26:32.279 --> 03:26:35.683
MENTIONED BY DOCTOR LEE. OR FOR

03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:36.517
EXAMPLE OTHER RESEARCH THAT HAS

03:26:36.584 --> 03:26:38.319
IDENTIFIED STRONG SEEN SUPPORT

03:26:38.385 --> 03:26:40.588
SYSTEMS AND HIRED AT AS AS A-

03:26:40.654 --> 03:26:43.157
AS A WAY FOR DISADVANTAGED

03:26:43.224 --> 03:26:43.758
STUDENTS ACTUALLY COMPLETE AND

03:26:43.824 --> 03:26:46.594
SUCCEED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. IN

03:26:46.660 --> 03:26:47.795
CLOSING WHAT THIS PROPOSAL HAVE

03:26:47.862 --> 03:26:49.029
HIGHLIGHTS THE ME AND A NUMBER

03:26:49.096 --> 03:26:50.231
OF MY COLLEAGUES AS A THAT

03:26:50.297 --> 03:26:51.332
THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF STRONG

03:26:51.398 --> 03:26:52.500
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE CABLE

03:26:52.566 --> 03:26:54.335
SYSTEM AND SEE IF YOU TO INSURE

03:26:54.401 --> 03:26:55.302
THAT THERE IS A CLEAR AND

03:26:55.369 --> 03:26:57.772
CONSISTENT ARTICULATION. AND

03:26:57.838 --> 03:26:58.305
EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH FAR

03:26:58.372 --> 03:27:01.041
HIGHER AT. IT WOULD BENEFIT ALL

03:27:01.108 --> 03:27:01.976
PARTIES A STRONGER AUTHENTIC

03:27:02.042 --> 03:27:03.277
PARTNERSHIP. INCREASE

03:27:03.344 --> 03:27:05.246
CURRICULUM DESIGN AND UPLAND

03:27:05.312 --> 03:27:05.846
IMPLEMENTATION EXISTED BETWEEN

03:27:05.913 --> 03:27:08.149
THE TWO. INDEED THERE ARE

03:27:08.215 --> 03:27:09.483
POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE SUCH AS

03:27:09.550 --> 03:27:10.751
LONG BEACH BUT WE ALSO MUST

03:27:10.818 --> 03:27:11.685
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LONG BEACH

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:13.287
UNIFIED HAS HAD MANY FACTORS

03:27:13.354 --> 03:27:14.288
THAT HAVE CREATED LONGEVITY

03:27:14.355 --> 03:27:16.357
LEADERSHIP. WHICH INCLUDES

03:27:16.423 --> 03:27:17.358
STRONG PRIVATE FOUNDATION

03:27:17.424 --> 03:27:19.360
FUNDING EITHER DIRECTLY OR

03:27:19.426 --> 03:27:20.561
THROUGH TO TREAT STRATEGIC

03:27:20.628 --> 03:27:23.097
PLANNING THAT WILL LIKELY NOT

03:27:23.164 --> 03:27:23.597
BE AVAILABLE TO ALL ONE

03:27:23.664 --> 03:27:24.198
THOUSAND PLUS HIGH SCHOOLS IN

03:27:24.265 --> 03:27:27.001
THE STATE. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW

03:27:27.067 --> 03:27:27.768
IN FISCAL RECEIVED RESOURCES

03:27:27.835 --> 03:27:29.270
AND A LOOMING RECESSION ON THE

03:27:29.336 --> 03:27:31.505
HORIZON. IS IT WISE TO IMPOSE

03:27:31.572 --> 03:27:33.140
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE

03:27:33.207 --> 03:27:33.841
CABLE SYSTEM WHEN MANY

03:27:33.908 --> 03:27:35.176
DISTRICTS ARE STILL TRYING TO

03:27:35.242 --> 03:27:36.644
JUST MEET. THE CURRENT

03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:38.779
REQUIREMENTS AND THE LOCAL

03:27:38.846 --> 03:27:39.346
CONTENT COAT LOCAL CONTROL

03:27:39.413 --> 03:27:41.315
FUNDING FORMULA MANDATES.

03:27:41.382 --> 03:27:42.750
AVAILABLE RESOURCES WOULD BE

03:27:42.817 --> 03:27:44.518
LIKELY BETTER SPENT ON HOW K.

03:27:44.585 --> 03:27:45.753
TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND WORK

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:47.254
TOGETHER TO CREATE LEARNING

03:27:47.321 --> 03:27:54.361
ENVIRONMENTS THAT. UBER IS ONLY

03:27:54.428 --> 03:27:56.330
ONE FACTOR THAT PREPARES K.

03:27:56.397 --> 03:27:56.931
TWELVE STUDENTS AT FOR SUCCESS

03:27:56.997 --> 03:27:59.633
IN THE CSU SYSTEM. THANK YOU

03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:00.935
THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY

03:28:01.001 --> 03:28:03.971
QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE BILL

03:28:04.038 --> 03:28:05.306
ISN'T JUST WANT WHAT QUESTIONS

03:28:05.372 --> 03:28:07.875
I KNOW YOU YEAH THANK TASK YEAR

03:28:07.942 --> 03:28:09.210
ONE DISTRICT AS A THOUSAND HAVE

03:28:09.276 --> 03:28:13.547
YOU SO THAT CSPA ASSOCIATION

03:28:13.614 --> 03:28:15.883
ARE THEY ENGAGED IN THIS ONE OR

03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:16.517
THE OTHER THERE OPPOSE THEY'VE

03:28:16.584 --> 03:28:17.985
COMMITTED A LOT ARE LOOK AT

03:28:18.052 --> 03:28:20.588
THIS AND I HAPPEN TO BE ALSO

03:28:20.654 --> 03:28:21.956
ONE OF THE CSPA. DELEGATES IF

03:28:22.022 --> 03:28:26.760
YOU ADD AOL AND. WHAT TO SOME

03:28:26.827 --> 03:28:27.394
OF THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THIS

03:28:27.461 --> 03:28:30.698
REQUIREMENT. WHAT ARE THEY HAVE

03:28:30.764 --> 03:28:31.498
A TEST A DISSENTING VOICE IN IT

03:28:31.565 --> 03:28:32.600
IN MATTER OF THE SUPPORT OF THE

03:28:32.666 --> 03:28:34.735
CSU POLICY I THINK THEY

03:28:34.802 --> 03:28:36.437
UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF

03:28:36.503 --> 03:28:37.438
THE COLLEAGUES IN TERMS OF

03:28:37.504 --> 03:28:38.639
FISCAL AND FISCAL

03:28:38.706 --> 03:28:40.674
RESPONSIBILITY AND- I THINK

03:28:40.741 --> 03:28:42.643
THAT THE LARGER ISSUE AT HAND

03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:43.711
IS. WHETHER NOT WE WERE ENGAGED

03:28:43.777 --> 03:28:45.880
FROM THE BEGINNING. RIGHT TO

03:28:45.946 --> 03:28:47.281
MAKE SURE IS THAT SIX YEARS IS

03:28:47.348 --> 03:28:48.549
THAT FOR YEARS AS A THREE YEARS

03:28:48.616 --> 03:28:50.618
IN TERMS OF. IS THIS IT DOES

03:28:50.684 --> 03:28:52.486
THIS MEET THEN TENTACLES OF CSU

03:28:52.553 --> 03:28:54.121
AND HOW WHAT IS THE ROLE K.

03:28:54.188 --> 03:28:56.023
TWELVE IN US. RIGHT SO THAT THE

03:28:56.090 --> 03:28:57.424
BIGGER QUESTION AMONG CALL A

03:28:57.491 --> 03:29:01.795
MONTH COLLEGE IS. HOW ARE WE

03:29:01.862 --> 03:29:02.296
ACTUALLY ENGAGING SCHOOL

03:29:02.363 --> 03:29:04.565
DISTRICT IN K. TWELVE. HELPFUL

03:29:04.632 --> 03:29:08.235
THANK YOU. EXTENT THEM AND

03:29:08.302 --> 03:29:09.470
THAT'S WHAT MY ONLY QUESTION

03:37:29.436 --> 03:37:31.605
ADOPTED COMMON CORE IN

03:37:31.671 --> 03:37:33.740
CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TEN. AN

03:37:33.807 --> 03:37:36.410
OLD MATH CLASSES YOU WERE ASKED

03:37:36.476 --> 03:37:36.910
TO MEASURE THE AREA OF A

03:37:36.977 --> 03:37:40.914
TRAPEZOID. AND COMMON CORE YOU

03:37:40.981 --> 03:37:43.850
ARE ASKED TO SHARE THREE WAYS

03:37:43.917 --> 03:37:44.551
TO FIND THE AREA OF A

03:37:44.618 --> 03:37:47.454
TRAPEZOID. TO EXPLAIN WHICH WAY

03:37:47.521 --> 03:37:50.624
IS BEST AND WHY. THIS IS AN

03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:53.427
EXPONENTIALLY DIFFERENT LEVEL

03:37:53.493 --> 03:37:56.062
OF QUANTITATIVE REASONING WE

03:37:56.129 --> 03:37:57.664
HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE

03:37:57.731 --> 03:37:59.833
THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING COMMON

03:37:59.900 --> 03:38:02.803
CORE AND ITS IMPACT ON A COHORT

03:38:02.869 --> 03:38:03.804
OF STUDENTS THAT HAS COMPLETED

03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:06.139
THE ENTIRE K. TWELVE MATH

03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:08.008
CURRICULUM WE WILL NOT HAVE

03:38:08.074 --> 03:38:09.810
THEIR GROUP OF STUDENTS INITIAL

03:38:09.876 --> 03:38:10.844
TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THAT'S

03:38:10.911 --> 03:38:12.412
THE EARLIEST POINT AT WHICH WE

03:38:12.479 --> 03:38:15.048
WOULD HAVE DATA SO THE CSU HAS

03:38:15.115 --> 03:38:16.450
DATA BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE

03:38:16.516 --> 03:38:18.051
RIGHT DATA. THE CHANCELLOR'S

03:38:18.118 --> 03:38:19.953
OFFICE SHOULD SLOW DOWN IT

03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:20.854
SHOULD CONSIDER ALL THE

INTENDED AND UNINTENDED

03:38:22.255 --> 03:38:23.890
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POLICY

03:38:23.957 --> 03:38:25.859
SHIFT AND WE SHOULD WORK

03:38:25.926 --> 03:38:26.960
TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:38:27.027 --> 03:38:29.463

TWELVE DISTRICTS WITH CSU

03:38:30.864 --> 03:38:32.966
FACULTY PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO

03:38:33.033 --> 03:38:34.468
PREPARE THE MATH INSTRUCTORS

03:38:34.534 --> 03:38:36.970
TOGETHER DATA. ANALYZE THE DATA

03:38:37.037 --> 03:38:39.039
MAKE SURE IT'S THE RIGHT DATA

03:38:39.105 --> 03:38:39.606
AND PERFORM MEANINGFUL AN IN

03:38:39.673 --> 03:38:42.008
DEPTH ANALYSIS REGARDING. THE

03:38:42.075 --> 03:38:43.443
POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:45.612
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POLICY WE

03:38:45.679 --> 03:38:47.981
SHOULD ONLY IMPLEMENTED WHEN

03:38:48.048 --> 03:38:49.349
ALL OF THESE CONCERNS ARE

03:38:49.416 --> 03:38:49.916
ADDRESSED AND THE NEGATIVE

03:38:49.983 --> 03:38:51.418
CONSEQUENCES THAT YOU'VE

03:38:51.485 --> 03:38:52.652

TRANSFER STUDENTS IN THIS

03:39:11.171 --> 03:39:14.774
PROPOSAL UP TO NOW THE PROPOSAL

03:39:14.841 --> 03:39:16.343
HAS BEEN SILENT ON THAT POINT

03:39:16.409 --> 03:39:19.279
AND AS YOU HEARD FROM A MISTER

03:39:19.346 --> 03:39:21.114
EVANS DISCUSSION IT HE ASSERTED

03:39:21.181 --> 03:39:22.616
THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF

03:39:25.852 --> 03:39:27.988
THINK TO HELP CLARIFY THIS

03:39:28.054 --> 03:39:31.691
POINT IT SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY

03:39:31.758 --> 03:39:33.260
STATED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF

03:39:33.326 --> 03:39:35.228
A PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THAT

03:39:42.702 --> 03:39:43.937
UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION

03:39:44.004 --> 03:39:46.206
