SHE PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY TWO BUT HER LEGACY OF WORK TO IMPROVE TEACHING AND MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE FOR STUDENTS INDOORS.

EQUITY WAS HER FOCAL POINT ESPECIALLY FOR BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS WHO WERE NOT BEING GIVEN ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS. HER PHILOSOPHY WAS THAT EVERY STUDENT NO MATTER THEIR BACKGROUND CAN SUCCEED. HER REACHING IMPACT WAS VAST EVIDENCED BY NOT ONLY THE LEGACY SHE LEAVES IN OUR SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY.
