LAST NIGHT. AT TEN PM LAST NIGHT BUT EVEN OF TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO REVIEW THESE AMENDMENTS AS I WILL DESCRIBE MY STATEMENT. IV AMENDMENTS OF THE COMMISSION IS ADOPTED IF VISSER RATE THE BILL IT'S NO LONGER A REAL NET NEUTRALITY BELL -- AND IT IS ASTOUNDING TO ME THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD AND THAT YOU WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE ABOUT BOW. BEFORE HEARING MY PRESENTATION BEFORE HEARING PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE HEARING SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ISSUED. ARE A PRODUCT LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS AGO ON SO I WILL STATE FOR THE RECORD I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED. IT WAS I THINK IT WAS A VIOLATION OF ASSEMBLY RULES BUT EVEN IF IT WASN'T. FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. SO COLLEAGUES THAT MYSTERY NAM ALSO DISAPPOINT THAT WE COULD NOT -- COME TO A CONCLUSION -- AND THAT I THINK THIS IS JUST A STARTING POINT TO A CONVERSATION. I DON'T SEE THIS ISN'T INTO CONVERSATION I DON'T -- AND IT'S YOU KNOW I'VE DISCUSSED BACK AND FORTH IN WITHOUT A VIGOROUS DEBATE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT WE BOTH BELIEVE A NET NEUTRALITY BILL* OUT WE BOTH BELIEVE. WERE AIMING AT THE SAME DIRECTION -- IN THE INTEREST IN THIS COMMITTEE ARE WE CAN CONTINUE OUR DEBATE OUTSIDE OF THE OF THE SITE COMMITTEE ROOM. I DO ONE ESTABLISH SOME RULES UP FOR PRESENTATION. WHAT WE'RE GONNA PROCEED AS YOU DO THIRTY MINUTES ON EACH SIDE -- AND TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS. THEREAFTER WILL PROCEED WITH THE FOREIGN AGAINST AND FOLKS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO STATE THEIR NAME. AND THEIR POSITION. I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THEM ETCETERA THIRTY MINUTES TOTAL ON EACH SIDE SO WILL ALLOW THIRTY MINUTES FOR THE FOR THIRTY MINUTES FOR THE AGAINST. AND WILL DO TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS -- HERE SO EACH SIDE COULD BREAK THEM UP AUTHOR AND A TWO MINUTE SEGMENTS. AFTER THAT WHEN WE GO THROUGH THE SUPPORTERS IN IN THE OPPOSITION. I'D PEOPLE ALWAYS TO BE ABLE TO STATE THEIR NAME AND THE POSITION. AFTER THIRTY MINUTES IS A COMBINATION OF MY PRESENTATION AND OUR WITNESS AND YOU WITNESSES YES. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT'S TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS. BUT IT'S THIRTY MINUTES TOTAL. THAT'S JUST A COMEDY AS MANY WINS AS POSSIBLE THIRTY MINUTES OF OKAY. NOW COLLEAGUES I AM ASSUMING -- LITTLE ALLERGY ISSUE. I'M COLLEAGUES I'D NINE DAYS AGO NET NEUTRALITY ENDED AND THE UNITED STATES. IT ENDED BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP'S FCC. I ERASED ESSENTIALLY ALL FEDERAL NET NEUTRALITY REGULATIONS. ON TOP OF THAT LAST WEEK THAT SAW THE ASTOUNDING APPROVAL OF E. TNT'S ACQUISITION. OF TIME WARNER. FOR EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. A MASSIVE CONSOLIDATION OF INTERNET ACCESS -- WITH MEDIA CONTENT. COMCAST HAS NOW INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS. TO ACQUIRE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOX FOR SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF IS THE SAME COMPANIES WHO ARE TELLING YOU THAT IF THEY CAN'T CHARGE INTERCONNECTION THIEVES TO ALLOW ACCESS -- IF THEY CAN'T BLOCKING THROTTLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE POOR AND NOT BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THEIR NETWORK EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ACQUISITION. THIS MEANS THAT A TNT COMCAST AND OTHER INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. CANAL DECIDE THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE CERTAIN APPS OR VISIT CERTAIN WEBSITES ON YOUR PHONE THAT'S THE STATE OF THE WORLD TODAY THEY CAN BLOCK. THROTTLE MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO THE SIDE YOU CAN ONLY GO TO THESE WEBSITES YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE OUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I AND THEY CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BASED PURELY ON THEIR BOTTOM LINE WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM MORE MONEY. BASED ON WHO IS PAYING THEM MORE BIG WEBSITE BIG SERVICE COMPEL LOT OF MONEY. ANYONE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A START UP FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WHETHER YOU ARE THE TEA PARTY OR WHETHER YOU ARE THE COURAGE CAMPAIGN. ARE YOU CAN BE BLOCKED OR THROTTLED IF THE ISP DOESN'T LIKE YOU WERE NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH -- YOUR INTERNET MORE AND MORE WILL START TO LOOK LIKE CABLE TV. WHERE YOU PAY A BIG MONTHLY FEE? AYE AYE AND THEY TELL YOU HERE ARE THE TOP YOU GO. TO AND YOU DON'T EVEN SEE THE ONES THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TO PRISON NOT PAYING THEM ENOUGH MONEY. AND CONTRARY TO THE CLAIMS FROM SOME OF THE BILL'S OPPONENTS THESE NET NEUTRALITY VIOLATIONS ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN. WE SAW IT WHEN A TNT BLOCKED SKYPE AND FACETIME YOUR MEMBER THAT. WENT EIGHTEEN TO SPRINT AND VERIZON ALL BLOCKED GOOGLE WALLET BECAUSE IT WAS A COMPETITOR. WHEN A CANADIAN ISP BLOCK THE ORGANIZING WEBSITE THAT ITS WORKERS WERE USING THE FORM A LABOR UNION? CALIFORNIA COLLEAGUES HAS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY. OUGHT TO SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE YET AGAIN THAT WE ARE A PROGRESSIVE LEADER NATIONALLY. THAT STRONG PUBLIC POLICY STARTS HEARING CALIFORNIA. OR WE CAN PASS A WE'RE COMPELLED TO PASS A STRONG THAT NEUTRALITY BILL WE CAN PASS -- A WEEK NET NEUTRALITY BILL SUCH AS THE ONE THAT IS NOW AMENDED BEFORE YOU. SPEND SOME A POWERFUL NEGATIVE MESSAGE. AFTERALL HOW CAN WE EXPECT CONGRESS TO PASS REBUTS NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS. IF CALIFORNIA CAN'T EVEN GET IT TOGETHER TO DO SO. WE WOULD ALL PREFER ONE STRONG UNIFORM NET NEUTRALITY STANDARDS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL -- BUT THE REALITY WE FACE IS THERE ARE NO FEDERAL PROTECTIONS IT IS NOW UP TO THE STATES TO ACT. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING THE NEUTRALITY IS THAT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS DON'T GET TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS ON THE INTERNET. THEY DON'T GET TO THE SIDE WHERE WE CAN GO OR WHERE WE CAN'T GO. THEY DON'T GET TO DECIDE WHICH MEDIA HE'D OR FAIL. WITHOUT CLEAR PROTECTIONS THE INTERNET IS A DRAMATIC RISK OF LOSING ITS STATUS AS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WERE ALL OF US CAN GO WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND USE WHATEVER SERVICES WE WANT TO USE -- IT'LL BE CHANGED TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE FORCED OR MANIPULATED TO GO ONLY WHERE THE BIG TELECOM AND CABLE COMPANIES WANT US TO GO. BASED ON WHERE THEY MAKE MORE MONEY. I AM PROUD TO PARTNER WITH SENATOR KEVIN DE LEóN IN THIS EFFORT. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IN COMBINATION WITH SENATOR DALY OWNS SP FOUR SIXTY WILL SET THE GOLD STANDARD NATIONALLY FOR NET NEUTRALITY. LAST THURSDAY SENATOR DE LEóN AND I REACH AGREEMENT ON NOT HAVING TO COMPETING BILLS BUT MAKING THEM JOINED AND COMPLIMENTARY -- WE SUBMITTED AMENDMENTS -- TO THE COMMITTEE -- TO DO THAT AND THE COMMITTEE DECLINES -- TO CROSS THOSE AMENDMENTS. I S. B. TWENTY TWO IS AYE STANDARDS BROADLY PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY THEY PROHIBIT ISPS FROM BLOCKING OR THROTTLING WEBSITES. FROM CREATING FAST LANES AND SLOW LANES OF FROM CHARGING TO SPEED UP TRAFFIC. S. B. A TWENTY TWO DOZEN JUSTIN SHORE NET NEUTRALITY ON THE I. S. P.'S OWN NETWORK. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT AYE IT'S PLEASE DON'T LEVERAGE WHERE OTHER NETWORKS FEED INTO THOSE NETWORKS WHAT'S CALLED INNER CONNECTION. TO AVOID NET NEUTRALITY. IF YOU ARE PROTECTING THAT NEUTRALITY ONLY ON THE ISPS NETWORK BUT NOT AT THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION WHICH IS WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS DO. THERE'S NO NET NEUTRALITY BECAUSE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS BLOCK OR THROTTLE OR SLOW YOU DOWN AT THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION AND YOU HAVE NO NINETY TRIAL IT. I S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO ALSO BANS CORPORATE SELF DEALING -- SOMETIMES CALLED ZERO RATING THAT IS HIGHLY ANTI COMPETITIVE AND ANTI CONSUMER AND AS A WAY FOR THE EYES PEAS TO FORCE POOR PEOPLE TO USE ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF WEBSITES -- THESE TYPES ZERO RATING -- PLANS ARE -- THEY THEY ARE HIGHLY HIGHLY. SO WHO IS SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING. OUR VERSION OF A TWENTY TWO NOT THE MUTILATED VERSION NOW PENDING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. BUT WHO'S SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING SB TWENTY TWO SP TWENTY TWO IS SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA NET NEUTRALITY ORDER. INCLUDING OBAMA'S FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER WHO SUPPORTS SB TWENTY TWO OTHER COMMISSIONERS. AS WELL WHO'S OPPOSING IT. THE SAME CORPORATIONS THAT GOD DONALD TRUMP'S FCC TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY A TNT COMCAST VERIZON ETCETERA THAT IS THE FIELD HERE. AYE IT DOES AS YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW SP TWENTY TWO IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER NANCY PELOSI WHO SENT THE CHAIRMAN A LETTER A FEW DAYS AGO. ASKING HIM NOT TO DO WITH THIS COMMITTEE JUST DEAD TO GOT THE BILL. ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY ARE BUT SARA SUPPORTS IT A BROAD LABOR COALITION LED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. A HUGE LIST OF OUR ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE ACLU THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY NEXT GEN COLOR OF CHANGE THE LA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FEDERATION AND ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ALL SUPPORT THE VERSION. OF THE BILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE JUST MUTILATED. THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY PORTENTS REALITY -- AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT. IN THE U. S. SENATE EVEN THE ONES WHO ARE IN JEOPARDY OF NOT BEING REELECTED PLUS THREE REPUBLICANS VOTED TO RESTORE THE STRONG THAT NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS FROM THE OBAMA ORDER WHICH ARE INCLUDED. IN THE ARBORS INVESTED TWENTY TWO BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AMANDA. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- IF HISTORY THE BILL. AND ELIMINATE CORNET ACTUALITY PROTECTIONS. ARE THE AMENDMENTS I TURNED THIS BILL INTO A BILL THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY. IT IS NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS A FAKE NET NEUTRALITY BILL -- THE AMENDMENTS CHERRY PICK. CHERRY PICK FROM THE OBAMA TWENTY FIFTEEN NET NEUTRALITY ORDER -- AND AND THIS IS A ORDER WAS HUNDREDS OF PAGES LONG. AND BASICALLY TAKE TWO PAGES AND SAY THIS IS ALL WE'RE DOING. AND IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE. THE OBAMA ORDER. DETECTIVE THAT NEUTRALITY AT THE POINT OF INNER. FOR EXAMPLE. PROHIBITED FEEDS TO ACCESS AN ICE PLEASE CUSTOMERS. THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS STRIP ALL OF THAT OUT THESE AMENDMENTS. MAKE THIS BILL FALL FAR SHORT. OF THE OBAMA TWENTY FIFTEEN NET NEUTRALITY ORDER DESPITE WHAT A TNT AND OTHERS ARE SAYING AND INTENSELY LOBBYING THIS COMMITTEE THAT IS NOT TRUE. THIS BILL IS NOW FAR SHORT OF WHERE THE OBAMA ORDER WAS. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I DO NOT STOP. OR PREVENT ISPS FROM BLOCKING THROTTLING OR SLOWING DOWN WEBSITES BEGINS AS DO THAT NOW AT THE POINT OF INTERCONNECTION -- AND THIS DOES NOT -- AND THIS HAS THE SAME AND READ WE HAD NO BILL AT ALL. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALLOW THE ICE PIECE TO CREATE FAST LANES TO ENHANCE OR SPEED UP FAVORED WEBSITES TO PAY MORE. WHILE RELEGATING EVERYONE ELSE. TO A SLOWER TRAFFIC LANES. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR PASSING LANES FOR FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL ALLOW -- EIGHTEEN T. AND OTHER ISPS TO THROTTLE AN ENTIRE CLASS OF APPLICATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE E. TNT COULD DECIDE THAT IT IS GOING TO THROTTLE. ALL TELEPHONY APPLICATIONS LIKE SKYPE REMINDED BECAUSE THOSE ARE COMPETING AGAINST EIGHTEEN TEETH TELEPHONY SERVICES. THEN AMENDMENTS DO NOT PROHIBIT THAT. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WILL THEY'LL. THE EIGHTEEN T. TO ENGAGE IN CORPORATE SELF DEALING. BY FAVORING ITS MASSIVE TIME WARNER MEDIA SITES OVER COMPETITORS SITES BY SAYING HEY VIEWS MY MEDIA SITES IT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST YOUR DATA IF YOU USE MY COMPETITORS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY DATA. I V. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE BILLS PROHIBITION ON QUOTES ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE OR MISLEADING MARKETING PRACTICES THAT MISREPRESENT THE TREATMENT OF INTERNET TRAFFIC. DOW WAS DELETED IN THE AMENDMENTS THESE US ADOPTED. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALLOW ISPS TO CHARGE WEBSITE GATEKEEPER FEES FOR ACCESS THE ISP CUSTOMERS AND IF THEY DON'T PAY. THOSE WEBSITE TO BECOME INVISIBLE TO CONSUMERS. AGAIN THE WHOLE POINT IN THAT NEUTRALITY IS THAT WE GET TO THE SIDE WHERE WE GO. BUT THE INNER ICE CUBES ARE NOT THE ONES TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS. YEAH DOT IS EXACTLY WHAT BE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL. THAT THIS COMMITTEE JUST VOTED TO ADOPT BEFORE EVEN HEARING THE BILL WILL DO. I COLLEAGUES WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO STAND UP FOR AN OPEN INTERNET. AND FOR THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RELY ON IT FOR AN INCREASING ARRAY OF NEEDS. FOR THE BUSINESSES WHETHER NONPROFITS LARGE COMPANIES START UPS BRICK AND MORTAR SMALL BUSINESSES. I CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT FAIR INTERNET ACCESS FOR THE OUT TICKETS TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE. AND PLAY SUCH AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. FOR THE LABOR UNIONS WHO WORK TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR WORKING PEOPLE. FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO INCREASINGLY RELY ON THE INTERNET TO DELIVER CARE. AND SO FORTH OUGHT AND YET FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU JUST ADOPTED BEFORE EVEN HEARING THE BILL -- IF DISARRAY THOSE PROTECTIONS WILL NOT ACTUALLY. APPLY NEUTRALITY YOU CAN LABEL THAT CHARLIE BILL IT'S NOT WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS -- SO COLLEAGUES I HOPE YOU WILL RESEND THOSE AMENDMENTS AND PASS AN ACTUAL NET NEUTRALITY BILL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I'D TO REITERATE I DO NOT ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS -- AND THE BILL IS. I I DON'T SUPPORT THAT OF THE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL. WITH ME TODAY ARE TO WIN THIS IS A BARBER BANSHEE BECK WHO IS A LAW PROFESSOR AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY -- WITH A PEACHY INVOLVED A NEUTRALITY FOR MANY YEARS AND PAUL GOODMAN FROM THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. MY NAME IS BARBARA FRENCHIE VIC I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT STANFORD LAW SCHOOL AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INTERNET AND SOCIETY THERE. I'VE A PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND A LAW DEGREE. I'M HERE AS AN INDEPENDENT ACADEMIC WHO HAS WORKED ON NET NEUTRALITY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. THE F. C. C.'S TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN OPEN INTERNET RULES RELY HEAVILY ON MY WORK. AS DID THE INDIAN AND CANADIAN RULES ON ZERO RATING AND THE E. USENET NEUTRALITY GUIDELINES. TODAY YOU ARE FACING A CHOP AT STARK CHOICE YOU CAN PAUSE S. B. A TWENTY TWO BRING MAGNITUDE CELTIC TO CALIFORNIA AND RESTORE THE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS THE FCC VOTED TO REPEAL IN DECEMBER INSTEAD. YOU JUST VOTED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY GOT THE BILL AND LEAVE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. WHEN I I THE TIME WITH THESE PROTECTIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER? LAST WEEK NET NEUTRALITY AND IT EIGHTEEN TEAM WHICH WAS TIME WORN OUT WITHOUT ANY PROTECTIONS ADOPTED FOR THE DEAL. AND CON BECAUSE OFFER TO BUY A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOX. THAT MEANS THAT THE MEGA CORPORATIONS LIKE AGENCY OR COMCAST THAT OWN THE CONTENT NOW ALSO OWN THE PIPES THAT DELIVER THAT CONTENT. AND WITHOUT NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS. THE SIZE PIECE HAVE THE MEANS MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY. TOLD THE INTERNET IN THEIR FAVOR. AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE FROM STARTUPS AND SMALL BUSINESSES TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. S. B. A TWENTY TWO IS CAREFULLY DRAFTED TO PREVENT OUT BY INCORPORATING BOTH. THE TWENTY FIFTEEN RULES AND THE IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FROM THE TEXT OF THE ORDER. THAT'S WHY IT'S WIDELY VIEWED AS A NET NEUTRALITY MODEL BILL. THAT WOULD SET THE STANDARD FOR OTHER STATES AND ULTIMATELY THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND THAT'S WHY FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER THE GUY WHO LITERALLY WROTE THE ORDER. PORTS SP A TWENTY TWO IT'S THE ONLY STATE LEVEL BILL HE SUPPORTS THAT SHOULD TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING [inaudible] BY CONTRAST THE CHAIRS AMENDMENTS THAT YOU JUST ACCEPT IT. OUR A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON NET NEUTRALITY MAKE NO MISTAKE THE SUN NOT SOME MODIFICATIONS AROUND THE EDGES. ANY BILL THAT AFTER THESE AMENDMENTS ICE PIECE ON NOW FREE TO CHARGE WEBSITES FOR ACCESS TO THE CUSTOMERS AND WE TALK. MISTER WINNER. TWENTY VICE IT IT'S TWO MINUTES YOU MAY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE BUT I I SAID I WOULD ADVISE. YES YOU MAY WISH TO CONTINUE YEAH. BUT I WANTED BY SOME AFTER THE EAST AFTER THESE AMENDMENTS ICE CUBES ARE NOW FREE TO BLOCK EVERY WHAT TO CHARGE EVERY WEBSITE A FEW FOR ACCESS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND BLOCK EVERY WEBSITE THAT DOESN'T PAY THEM A FEW. THAT MEANS IF YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL HASN'T PAID YOUR I SP YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO YOUR SCHOOL'S WEBSITE. AFTER THESE AMENDMENTS ICE PIECE CAN NOW BLOCK SLOW DOWN WATCH HOT FOOT TRAFFIC AT THE POINT WHERE DATA AND TEST THE NETWORK BECAUSE YOU GOT IT. THE PROTECTIONS AGAINST CIRCUMVENTING THE RULES AT THE POINT WHERE DATA AND HAS THE NETWORK. AFTER THE AMENDMENTS ICED HE'S ON ALL FREE TO SLOW DOWN HALL CLASSES OF TRAFFIC [inaudible] SPEED UP. INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS ALL WHOLE CLASSES OF APPLICATION. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO ICON IMAGINE THAT THAT'S THE INTENT OF YOUR AMENDMENTS. AND AFTER THE AMEND VANCE AT AND HE CAN COUNT EVERY WEEK VIDEO ON THE INTERNET AGAINST USE US ARTIFICIALLY LOW. DATA CAPS WHILE EXEMPTING THE CONTENT IT OWNS ITSELF. A BILL THAT ALLOWS BIASED PIECE TO DO ALL THESE THINGS IS NOT NET NEUTRALITY. SO TODAY THE INTERNET AS A SPACE WHERE EVERY CALIFORNIAN NO MATTER THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OF THE SIZE OF THE WALLETS. HAS AN EQUAL CHANCE OF REACHING PEOPLE ONLINE. IT'S IS SPACE WHERE WE THE PEOPLE NOT AYE IS PEACE DETERMINE WHAT SUCCEEDS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. OUR CULTURE AND OUR ECONOMY. BY CONFERENCING RESTORING THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PROTECTIONS SBA TWENTY TWO WOULD KEEP IT THAT WAY. AS SENATOR MARKEY SAID YESTERDAY ALL EYES ON CALIFORNIA. I URGE YOU TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THIS GREAT STATE AND LEAD THE NATION. AND RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION AND PAUSE SP AB TWENTY TWO WITHOUT THAT YES AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PAUL GIVEN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND THE CENTER FOR MEDIA JUSTICE. BUT ASK THE COMMITTEE. TO EXCEPT AS BE EIGHT TWENTY TWO WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT JUST SIGNIFICANT WE CAN THE BELL. AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO JOIN SB A TWENTY TWO WITH SP. A FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH GREEN LINING GREEN LINE IS A PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR INCOME IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS THE SAME ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AS THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. NET NEUTRALITY IS A KEY PART OF OUR WORK. FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS I'VE REPRESENTED GREEN LIGHTING ON TELECOMMUNICATION ANTITRUST ISSUES AND PRIOR TO JOINING GREEN LIGHTING I WORKED ON THAT EACH CHILD ISSUES FOR THE BROADBAND INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA. I CURRENTLY SERVE ON THE ASK FEDERAL COMMUNICATION COMMISSIONS CONSUMER ADVISORY COMMITTEE [inaudible] OF FIRST. I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT A AND THE FCC'S LATEST. RULING ON NET NEUTRALITY IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THAT THAT COMMISSION MADE THE DECISION TO LOCK THE PUBLIC. OUT OF THE DISCUSSION BY DECIDED TO IGNORE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I AM PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DECIDED DO THE SAME. BY VOTING ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WITHOUT ANY IMPLIED BOB. BUT I'M HERE SPECIFICALLY TODAY TO TALK ADDRESS INDUSTRY CLAIMS A STRONG NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS SOMEHOW HARM COMMITTEES OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES I'M HERE SAY THOSE CLAIMS ARE NEITHER GENUINE MARK TRUE. IT'S DEEPLY FRUSTRATING TO SEE ISPS STUMBLING ALL OVER THEMSELVES TO PRAY TRADE THEMSELVES IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT A COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AS THIS COMMITTEE IS NO DOUBT AWARE AYE LAST WEEK CAL INNOVATES RELEASED A STUNNINGLY DISINGENUOUS THREE PAGE DOCUMENT. I'M MAKING THE UNDERPLAYED SUPPORT A CLAIM THAT STRONG NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS THAT HARM COMMITTEES CALLER AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES BY INCREASING THE COST OF MOBILE DATA SERVICES BY AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. I'VE WORKED FOR REMAINING OVER AS A SET FOR SEVEN YEARS ABOUT THAT THE CPUC AND THE FCC WORKING ON MATTERS -- AS VARIED AS MERGER OF YOU LOW INCOME PROGRAMS PRIVACY ISSUES AND NET NEUTRALITY. OVER THOSE SEVEN YEARS I HAVE CONSISTENTLY ASKED AYE AYES PIECE DIVIDE ME DATA ABOUT HOW THEIR BUSINESS DECISIONS HOW THEIR BUSINESS MODELS AFFECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND IF THERE'S ANY DISPARATE TREATMENT I'VE RECEIVED THREE RESPONSES. ONE WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. TWO WE DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO COLLECT THAT DATA ANALYZE THAT DATA AND THREE AYE IF WE DID COLLECT THAT DATA ANALYZE THAT DATA THAT LEAVE US OPEN TO A LAWSUIT FOR DISCRIMINATION SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR YET TODAY. THESE BROADBAND PROVIDERS HAVE RACKED THE COME UP OF ANALYSIS AND NOW SAYS OH ZERO RATING. OF THAT IS SOMEHOW GOING TO HARM COMMUNITIES. CONTRARY TO I SP CLAIMS THE WEAKER WATER DOWN THAT METALLIC PROTECTIONS ACTUALLY THREATEN TO HARM COMMITTEES OF COLOR. THAT STRONG ZERO RATING BANDS ON DISCRIMINATORY ZERO RATING. OF SPEAKERS AND TRADERS OF COLOR. WHO CAN'T PAY FOR INTERNET FAST LANES OR ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE PICKED BY HIGHEST FEES TO BE? ZERO RATED IT'S GOING BE HARDER FOR THEM TO PRODUCE I OR OR PRODUCE OR PROFIT FROM. THEIR OWN CREATIONS. ADDITIONALLY AS THEIR RATING INCENTIVIZE ISP'S TO KEEP DATA CAPS LOW IN ORDER TO MOTIVATE WEBSITES TO PAY FOR ZERO RATING AND THOSE ARTIFICIALLY LOW CAPS WILL HIT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE HARDEST. FINALLY WEEK NET NEUTRALITY PROTECTIONS WITHOUT PRINT PROHIBITIONS ON PAID PRIORITIZATION ZERO RATING ROLE WILL RESULT IN TWO KINDS OF INTERNET SERVICES. HIGH SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE FOR THAT CONNECTS THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT AND SECOND CLASS SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL BROADBAND SERVICE FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR OWN STORIES WITHOUT I SP GATEKEEPERS DECIDING WHETHER THOSE VOICES ARE PROFITABLE ENOUGH TO BE HEARD. I HAVE ONE FINAL POINT. AND THAT'S OF THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WILL DO ANYTHING TO STOP THIS BODY FROM ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO AN OPEN INTERNET. I TO LIMIT NOT DEVELOP TEXANS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ICE PIECE OF THE SITE THEMSELVES. WITH AN ADMINISTRATION AS PARTICULARLY. PERSISTENTLY ATTACKED AND THAT MEANS OUR FRIENDS COMMUNITIES AND LOVED ONES OF COLOR. I ONE OPPONENT EIGHTEEN T.

YOU HAVE THIRTY MINUTES HAVE RECOMMEND TWO MINUTES PER PRESENTATION BUT YOU CAN USE THEM AS YOU WISH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL DIVINE AND I REPRESENT A T. AND T.. A TNT SUPPORTS AN OPEN INTERNET. WE DO NOT BLOCK WEBSITES WE DO NOT CENSOR ONLINE CONTENT AND WE DO NOT DEGRADE INTERNET TRAFFIC. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE. THERE ARE ENFORCEABLE BY THE FCC THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. I AM HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE A NET NEUTRALITY LEGISLATION AND SPECIFICALLY S. B.. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WHICH GOES BEYOND [inaudible] OBAMA'S FCC ORDER. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATION SENATOR WIENER IS PROPOSING WILL HARM CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND DAMAGE THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE INTERNET HAS BEEN THE MAJOR ENGINE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THE INDUSTRY INVESTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. IN INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTING IN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO VIRTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIA. AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. WE ARE ON THE THRESHOLD OF A SECOND TECHNOLOGY WAVE WITH THE INVENTION AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. GIGABIT SPEEDS OVER FIBER. AND THE INTERNET OF THINKS. WE OPPOSE EIGHTEEN EIGHT TWENTY TWO BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT BECOME IT WILL BECOME A BARRIER TO DEPLOYING THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. EIGHT TWENTY TWO DOES NOT REINSTATE THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA FCC RULES RATHER IT GOES FAR BEYOND. LET ME HIGHLIGHT A NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES. EARLIER YOU HEARD CONVERSATION ABOUT INNER CONNECTION S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WOULD BAN LONG STANDING COMMERCIALLY NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS BETWEEN ISPS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS AND REYES CONSUMER PRICES. S. B. A TWENTY TWO WOULD SHIFT THESE CALLS FROM MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CONTENT COMPANIES. TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. HERE'S WHAT THE OBAMA FCC SAID ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I QUOTE. THIS ORDER DOES NOT APPLY THE OPEN INTERNET RULES TO INNER CONNECTION UNQUOTE. THE FCC WORK ON TO WRITE AGAIN A QUOTE WE CONCLUDE THAT IT WOULD BE PREMATURE. TO ADOPT PRESCRIPTIVE RULES TO ADDRESS ANY PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN OR MAY ARISE UNQUOTE. MEMBERS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THE OBAMA FCC DID NOT PROHIBIT ISPS LONGSTANDING INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. ZERO RATINGS A SECOND ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO WOULD AND POPULAR CONSUMER DRIVEN ZERO RATING PROGRAMS. ENDING FREE DATA INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMERS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ESPECIALLY POPULAR WITH YOUNG MINORITY AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. A RECENT STUDY WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD DISCUSSED. HAS IDENTIFIED THAT AT LEAST THREE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA USERS [inaudible] ENJOY. FREE DATA ZERO RATING AND THEY ARE SAVING UPWARDS OF THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. WITH THESE THREE DATA PROGRAMS IF YOU WERE TO PASS SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO IT WOULD BAN ZERO RATING AND THREE POINT SIX MILLION CUSTOMERS WHAT EITHER CHANGE THEIR VIEWING PRACTICES OR SEE A PRICE INCREASE IN THEIR BILLS. IN JANUARY. THE OBAMA FCC LOOKED CLOSELY AT THIS ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND SPECIFICALLY DID NOT PROHIBIT. ZERO RATING. PROCUREMENT IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS IN BOTH BILLS. THE OBAMA NET NEUTRALITY RULES DID NOT INCLUDE FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL PROCUREMENT [inaudible] PERIOD. REQUIRING STATE AGENCY TO INCLUDE NET NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHAT HAD COMPLEXITY. AND LITIGATION TO AN ALREADY SLOW AND CUMBERSOME PROCESS. THE RESULT WILL BE ADDITIONAL DELAY IN DEPLOYING THE MOST ADVANCED INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WHO SERVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS? AND FINALLY THERE IS THE ISSUE AND THE CONFUSION THAT IS BEING SOLD ON PREEMPTION. BOTH THE OBAMA TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDER. AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FCC ORDER INCLUDED FEDERAL PREEMPTION. IN THEIR NET NEUTRALITY ORDER. EVEN FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER WHO SOMEONE SPOKE OF EARLIER RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A NATIONAL POLICY. HE READ HE RECOGNIZED THE INTERNIST INTERNET IS AN INTERSTATE SERVICE. IN THE COMMISSION'S ORDER AND I QUOTE. HE WANTS TO REAFFIRM THE COMMISSION'S LONG STANDING CONCLUSIONS THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE IS JURISDICTION ONLY INTERSTATE. FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF THE FCC CHAIRED BY TOM WHEELER. SO MEMBERS IN CONCLUSION. THIS BILL S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO IS TOO EXTREME. IT GOES FAR BEYOND THE FCC'S TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDER UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO PRESENTATION OF ANY EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM. I ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN SURFING ON THE WEB YOUR OWN ENQUIRIES IN THE INTERNET YOU'RE NOT BLOCKED YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE. ANYTIME ON THE INTERNET AND GATHER ANY INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO LOOK AT WE BELIEVE A TWENTY TWO IS IT ANTI CONSUMER AND WILL DRIVE UP THE COST. SERVICE FOR INTERNET SERVICE EIGHT TWENTY TO CREATE A REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND LITIGATION. ENVIRONMENT THAT HARMS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND WEEKENDS WEEKENDS CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP. IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION GOING FORWARD. WE WOULD URGE THE MEMBERS TO VOTE NO ON NET NEUTRALITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE AND BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS IN PLANT. HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AND WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY GIVEN THE ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE FCC IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHERE THEY MOVED TO REPLACE THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FCC ORDER. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AT FIRST OF ALL. ALL OF MY MEMBER COMPANIES ADHERE TO THE POLICIES AND THE PRINCIPLES OF AN OPEN INTERNET. BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT WITHOUT REGULATORY STRUCTURE AT THIS POINT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT GOVERNS OUR ACTIVITIES ON THE INTERNET. IS THE SAME REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE AND WHY THAN PLACE UP UNTIL. TWENTY FIFTEEN IT IS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER WE BROWN AND THRIVE AND BECOME THE TOOL THAT WE KNOW IT TO BE TODAY. SO WE DON'T SEE A NEED TO HAVE STATES IMPOSING ADDITIONAL REGULATION HERE ON A SERVICES MISTER DEVINE POINTED OUT THAT IS IN INTERSTATE SERVICE AND SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY ONE SET OF REGULATIONS AND THE FRAMEWORK. THAT IS IN FACT CURRENTLY IN PLACE WE BELIEVE THE STATE'S ARE PREEMPTED IN THIS SPACE THERE WILL LIKELY RESULT IN. SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION AND THAT TOO WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE OPERATIONS OF OUR INTERNET IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS WRITTEN THE BILL WOULD ALLOW NOT ONLY BE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT IT WOULD ALLOW FIFTY EIGHT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. CITY ATTORNEYS AND JOHN DOE CITIZENS TO BRING LAWSUITS. ALL OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THESE PROHIBITIONS ARE IN THIS BILL SUBJECTING US. TO VARIOUS TYPES OF AB I HAVE AB PROSECUTIONS I AM. BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF WHOEVER HAPPENS TO BE IN CHARGE. LASTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT S. B. EIGHT TWO TWO WAS IN FACT ATTEMPTING TO RE CODIFY THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. IT WAS NOT A GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER IN FACT IN ITS CURRENT VERSION IT STILL GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER BY HAVING SO MANY ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND BY INCLUDING THE PROHIBITIONS. ON PROCUREMENT I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY RECTAL CANCER IS A PARTNER WITH THE LAW FIRM OF WELCOME THING BAKER AND OUR HE HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNICATION SPACE AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE FCC. BUT MORE RECENTLY HE WAS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE NET NEUTRALITY PROCEEDINGS THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE FCC. ON THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER AND THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ORDER AFTER ABOUT. NUMBER OKAY CAN ORDER OKAY AND THAT AND THAT. TWENTY THOU THOU I BASS MISTER HOUSER HERE TODAY TO JOIN ME SO THAT HE CAN ACTUALLY SPEAK TO THE PROVISIONS HAVE EIGHT TO TWO THAT WERE NOT. A PART ADD THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FCC ORDER SO IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO HAND OFF TO MISTER HOW YOU ANSWER. YOU CAN USE YOUR THIRTY MINUTES OF THE WAY YOU WANT AMBER I RECOMMEND TWO MINUTES HOWEVER USING HOW YOU WANT. THINK WE'RE GONNA GO. I THAT THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CAROLYN AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. SAW SO THE DAY THIS IS THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FCC ORDER WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AYE THE DAY CAME OUT HAVING WORKED ON YOU ON A FOR VARIOUS KINDS OF PRINT IT OUT. I LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR OF MY OFFICE AND TO COVER POP PROBABLY FOR THE TWO YEARS AFTER THAT I THAT WASN'T TOO DAY THAT WENT BY WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSULT IT. AYE AYE. YOU KNOW IT'S NO IT'S NO FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S OF WORK I KNOW WELL -- THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF I SP EIGHT TWENTY TWO WENT WELL BEYOND WHAT THIS ORDER SAID I WANT TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THEM THAT THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. SO I'LL START WITH YOUR RATING. THERE ARE TWO WAYS IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL BILL WENT BEYOND. THE FCC'S TWENTY FIFTEEN DECISION WITH REGARD TO YOUR RATING. FIRST BY ADOPTING PACIFIC SUBSTANTIVE MANDATE WHEN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER REFUSED TO DO THAT AND SECOND BY FOR BIDDING ACTUAL ACTIVITY THAT EVEN THE WHEELER A BOMB FCC DID NOT THAT DID NOT BAN. SO FIRST THE THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL ADOPTED A RULE SETTING OUT A SUBSTANTIVE STANDARD WITH RESPECT IS YOUR RATING. THAT IS WHAT IS ALLOWED WHAT'S NOT ALLOWED WHEN THE FCC HAD EXPRESSLY REFUSED TO DO SO. IT HELD A PARAGRAPH ONE FIFTY ONE OF THIS ORDER THAT THE RECORD REFLECTED MIXED VIEWS ABOUT YOUR RATING AND SPONSOR DATA PLANS. IF RECOGNIZE RECORD EVIDENCE THAT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS QUOTE MAY IN SOME INSTANCES PROVIDE BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS CITING ARGUMENTS THAT THESE BUSINESS MODELS INCREASE CHOICE AND LOWER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. GIVEN THE MIX EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD THE FCC EXPLICITLY DECLINED TO ADOPT A RULE. I INDEED IN A TWENTY SIXTEEN INTERVIEW WITH THE ONLINE PUBLICATION THE VERGE CHAIRMAN WHEELER SAID WE ARE QUITE SPECIFIC IN THE OPEN INTERNET ORDER ARE SAYING WE WEREN'T GOING TO ADDRESS YOUR RATING. BECAUSE WE COULD ARGUE IT BOTH WAYS YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT'S HELPFUL IF IT REDUCES COST INCREASES CHOICE THOSE WERE CHAIRMAN WHEELERS WORDS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER REFUSED TO DOT JUST SIT. RUINS YOUR RATING -- AT PARAGRAPH ONE FIFTY TWO OF YOUR EMPHASIZE THAT WOULD LOOK AT AN ASSESSMENT PRACTICES UNDER WHAT IT CALLED THE NO ONE REASONABLE INTERFERENCE OR DISADVANTAGE STANDARD. WHAT'S SOMETIMES CALLED THE GENERAL CONDUCT STANDARD -- THAT'S STANDARD STATES THAT NICE PIECE ON NOT UNREASONABLY INTERFERE WITH RUN REASONABLY DISADVANTAGE AND USERS ABILITY TO SELECT ACCESS AND USE BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE -- TERRORISTS HAD OUR OUT WERE EDGE PROVIDERS ABILITY TO MAKE LAWFUL CONTENT APPLICATIONS ARE DEVICES SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ALL END USERS. WHAT'S CRITICAL HERE IS THAT SECTION ONE SEVEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX EIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL SB -- SEVEN SB TWENTY TWO IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT FCC RULE THAT IS IF YOU WANTED A BILL THAT WOULD MATCH WITH THE FCC DID ON YOUR RATING WHAT YOU DO IS ADOPT A BILL THAT HAD. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX EIGHT THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT BILL OR AS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED DID INSTEAD IT WENT FURTHER ADOPTED A SPECIFIC SUB DIFFERENT PART ON TOP OF THAT. BY DEFINITION IT WENT FARTHER. THE SECOND WAY IN WHICH A TWENTY TWO WENT BEYOND THE FCC DECISION IS THAT EXPRESSLY PRECLUDES SOME ACTIVITY THAT THE OBAMA ERA FCC. UNDER CHAIRMAN WHEELER DID NOT FAR SO I'LL OFFER A VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLE S. B. TWENTY TWO YOU ARE AS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED COMPLETELY BARRED YOUR RATING OF A CONTEMPLATED OFFERINGS. IF THE CONTENT PROVIDER PAID THE I. S. P. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT YOU'RE RATING. THAT'S A PRACTICE THAT'S KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY IS SPONSORED DATA THE IDEA IS ESSENTIALLY HEY IF I'M A KIND TO PROVIDER I WANT PEOPLE TO USE MY STUFF. I'M GONNA OFFSET YOUR COSTS FOR DATA I'M GONNA POTENTIALLY PAID OF CONTEMPT THAT THE EYES INSTEAD OF YOU -- IS A RELATIVELY ELLIPSES AT LEAST NOT AN UNCOMMON PRACTICE THE FCC TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER EXPRESSLY REFUSED TO BAR SPONSOR DATA ARRANGEMENTS AGAIN A PARAGRAPH ONE FIFTY ONE IT'S SAID THAT THOSE. DATE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS INCREASED CHOICE AND LOWER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS -- SO SO WHEN IT IS SO IN SUMMARY ON THAT -- THIS A TWENTY TWO IS REALLY PLANTED BARRED THE THING THAT THE FCC SAID IT WANTED OF YOU IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS OKAY. NO RETURNED INTERCONNECTION I'M. ALSO KNOWN AS TRAFFIC EXCHANGE SO THAT WE FIRST THE HANDOFF OF TRAFFICKING OF DEEP INSIDE THE INTERNET NOT THE LAST MILE PIPES THAT THE THE EYES PEAS OPERATE ITEM WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU BUY BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE FROM THEM BUT UPSTREAM TO WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF IS KIND OF THE LARGER ARTERIES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE INTERNET? I'M HERE TO THE BILL SETS FORTH THE BILL'S ORIGINALLY PRESENTED AS WRITTEN SET FORTH A SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SIX I WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL FOR HIGHEST PEATED ENGAGE IN PRACTICE WITH RESPECT. TO RELATED TO IT ISP TRAFFIC TO CHANGE THE HAVE THE PER. THE FCC IN CONTRAST EXPRESSLY DECLINED TO ADOPT SUCH ARBITRARY REQUIREMENT IN FACT CHAIRMAN WHEELERS ORDER I SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WOULD NOT ADOPT THAT IT'S HAD A PARAGRAPH ONE NINETY FIVE SAYING THAT WE CONCLUDE THAT APPLICATION OF OUR RULES HERE. I WOULD BE WOOD IS NOT WARRANTED WITH RESPECT INTERNET TRAFFIC CHANGED ITS OTHER PARAGRAPH TWO OH TWO SAYING IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE OR NECESSARY TO SUBJECT ARRANGEMENTS FOR IN THAT TRAFFIC IT CHANGED. TO THE OPEN INTERNET RULES IT SENATOR PARAGRAPH TO A SIX AGAIN TO BE CLEAR WE ARE NOT APPLYING THE OPEN INTERNET RULES WE DOT TODAY TO INTERNET TRAFFIC EXCHANGE. SO THERE'S A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REGIME IN WHICH THE REGULATOR MERELY ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY AS THE FCC DIDN'T TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ONE THAT ESTABLISHES SUBSTANTIVE RULES THAT THE FCC. I IN FACT NEVER EXERCISED IN THE TWO YEARS DURING WHICH THAT ORDER WHAT WAS IN EFFECT I'M. I'VE ALSO SEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT ON THIS POINT THAT THE ACT THAT THE FCC WAS GOING TO REVIEW EVERY INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT CASE BY CASE. THAT'S JUST NOT SO HOT WHAT IT SAID IT WAS A MEAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO REVIEW DISPUTES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO IT BY PARTIES. AGAIN THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REGULAR THAT SITS AND LOOKS AT EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE OF AN AGREEMENT COMES YOU FOR IT. PROBABLY NOT PRACTICAL IT ANYWAY IN ANY CASE AND EVERY GENE WHICH THE FCC SAID WILL BE A JUDGE OF SOMEONE HAS HAS A PROBLEM -- WITH THAT I WIL -- SEE THE FLOOR AND WAIT FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON. YEAH THE WIRELESS. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE A FIFTEEN MINUTES THANK YOU. WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE COMMITTEE THAT NOT ONLY DO WE OPPOSE HAS BE EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS WRITTEN. WE OPPOSE AS BE A TWENTY TWO AS AMENDED TODAY. BUTTONS NOT A SUGGESTION THAT WE BELIEVE WELL AS SOME OF THE WITNESSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE SAYS OF HISTORY TO NET NEUTRALITY FAR BEYOND THAT WE BELIEVE THE BILL EVEN AS AMENDED. GOES BEYOND THE TWENTY FIFTEEN A BOMB ORDER AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OF THE STATE BY STATE REGULATION OF THE INTERNET. IS INAPPROPRIATE -- AND THE THE ROOM RARELY DO THAT -- THE FALLACY AT THE HEART OF S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO OR EVEN THE BILL AS AMENDED. UP IS THE FALSE PRESUMPTION THAT ONE SIDE OF NET NEUTRALITY DEBATE ACTUALLY OPPOSES AND OPEN INTERNET. THAT IS FALSE -- THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE TWENTY FIFTEEN OBAMA ORDER WHICH IS. SIMILAR TO BUT NOT IDENTICAL TO THE BILL AS AS AMENDED THIS MORNING. BECAUSE THE MOBILE BROADBAND INDUSTRY. TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT IN MOBILE BROADBAND BY SIX POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY [inaudible] THAT'S BILLION. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY -- THESE THE RULES THAT ARE WE BELIEVE ARE NECESSARY -- WE TALKED ABOUT MISTER WHEELER RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A SINGLE NATIONAL REGULATORY MODEL -- BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE. THE FEAR OF UNREALIZED HARM. BE THE BASIS FOR ENACTING LAWS THAT WILL CURB THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. AS BE A TWENTY TWO IN ITS ORIGINAL FORMAT DO THAT AND BY THE WAY WE BELIEVE. S. B. EIGHT TWENTY TWO AS AMENDED WILL STILL DO THAT -- BROADBAND PROVIDERS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN ALMOST EVERY STAKEHOLDER HAVE COMMITTED TO RESPECTING AND PROTECTING THE OPEN INTERNET. ALARMIST SPECULATION TO THE CONTRARY AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALARMIST SPECULATION TO THE CONTRARY. DOESN'T SUPPORT A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM THE TRENCH TRADITIONAL LIKE REGULATORY APPROACH. THE FACTS ARE CLEAR OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE PUBLICLY COMMITTED NOT TO BLOCK THROTTLE OR AND COMPETITIVELY. PRIORITIZE INTERNET TRAFFIC WHILE ACTING WITH TRANSPARENCY IN WHAT THEY DO. PLEASE DO NOT LET RHETORIC AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE RHETORIC IN TERMS OF HARM THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY. TRIUMPH OVER REALITY. THE ONLY TANGIBLE COST WILL BE TO THE PEOPLE AND INNOVATORS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL OF WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. KEVIN WILL CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY ACTION FUND CAME HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILLBUT NOW MUST OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE THE OUTRAGEOUS AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE IS ADDED TO IT. ANGELA BANG WITH ASIA RESOURCES INCORPORATED WE OPPOSE SP FOUR SIXTY AND SB. EIGHTY TWO I THINK AT THIS POINT TIME WE UNLESS THERE'S ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- IT WOULD BE I AM GOING TO GO TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN START -- I'M WITHDRAWING THE BILL FROM COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION IN THIS HEARING I DON'T WANT TO VOTE TODAY ON THIS BILL. OP MORE OF A STATEMENT YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE AS A VERY POLITICIZED ISSUE. AND I JUST WANTED TO TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT. WHAT NET NEUTRALITY IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE DO A DISSERVICE TO THE ISSUE IF WE DON'T? A TAKE A NON EMOTIONAL INTELLECTUAL APPROACH TO DEBATE. I WHEN WE USE EMOTIONALLY LOADED TERMS LIKE -- WOULD NEUTRALITY IS A GOOD ONE BUT AN OPEN FREE INTERNET WHO WOULD BE AGAINST THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL CHARGE BUT ALSO. IN OUR PRESENTATIONS HERE WE'VE HEARD SOME VERY PROVOCATIVE THINGS AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYONE. IS TALKING ABOUT -- OF SCHOOL HAVING TO PAY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER SO THAT PARENTS COULD GO ONLINE TO GET THEIR CHILDREN'S. ACADEMIC RECORDS I MEAN I I REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THAT WAS AGAINST THE LAW. ANY INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER THE TRIED TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE A WHOLESALE DEFECTION OF THEIR ENTIRE CUSTOMER BASE AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT DOING THAT. SO WHEN MY CONSTITUENTS COME TO BE AN ASK TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY I USE A METAPHOR AND MAYBE BE HELPFUL. SO WHAT I TALK ABOUT IS A VILLAGE BESIDE A RIVER AND A A BRIDGE OPERATOR BUILDS A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER TO THE VILLAGE WHICH IS GREATLY BENEFICIAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. BUT TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF CONSTRUCTING THE BRIDGE IN OPERATING THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE OPERATOR INSTITUTE TOLLS ON THAT BRIDGE. SO THE QUESTION IS. IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER OVER THE BRIDGE SHOULD THEY PAY THE SAME TOLL AS A HONDA CIVIC. AND IF YOU THINK THAT THEY SHOULD THEN YOU'RE. A PROPONENT OF BRIDGE NEUTRALITY RIGHT YOU THINK ALL TRAFFIC SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME. HEALTH PRETEND FURTHER THAT THE BRIDGE OPERATOR WANTS TO CREATE A ARE A FAST TRACK CLEAN. WHERE YOU CAN PAY? TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS LANGUAGE BY THE WAY BENEFITS ALL THE USERS OF THE BRIDGE BECAUSE DIVERT TRAFFIC AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY THAT HIGHER TOLL THAT'S THAT'S PAID PRIORITIZATION. CAPE SO. I WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THAT I I'VE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SPENT FOR HAVE A HARD TIME. JUSTIFYING WHY THAT'S NOT AN OKAY THING TO DO. AND THE ONLY ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT THAT RESONATES TO ME. IS THAT MAYBE IT GIVES THE BRIDGE OPERATOR. AN UNFAIR AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT GOES INTO THE VILLAGE RIGHT OF THE BRIDGE OPERATOR DID SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS LIKE. PROHIBITING TRUCKS THAT HAD BEEN AND AS IN THEM. WE COULD SAY LEGITIMATELY WHILE IT'S NOT FAIR FOR THE BRIDGE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EAT [inaudible] OKAY. WHICH IS AGENDA SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID IN AND IN THIS DEBATE. BUT THE ONLY THING THAT'S REQUIRED. TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. IS MORE BRIDGES. THERE'S A BRIDGE A MILE DOWN THE RIVER. THAN ANYONE HAS BEEN AND AS IN THEIR TRUCK IF THEY WERE TO DO SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS LIKE THAT THEY WOULD GO USE A DIFFERENT BRIDGE. AND HERE'S THE BIG PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH WITH. THIS ISSUE IN GENERAL NET NEUTRALITY IN GENERAL IS THAT THE MORE. OPPRESSIVE REGULATION THAT WE LATER ON INDUSTRY THE LAST BRIDGES THAT WE GET. AND OF MORE BRIDGES IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO OUR SOCIETY THAT SOLVES A WHOLE HOST OF PROBLEMS INCLUDING A LOT OF THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP. IN DEBATE TODAY BUT ONE IMPORTANT ONE THAT HASN'T AND THAT IS FAIR PRICING. YOU GET FAIR PRICING FOR FREE IF YOU HAVE LOTS OF BRIDGES. AND THAT'S WHY. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AN INTELLECTUAL WAY I CAN'T BE A SUPPORTER OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BILL TODAY EVEN AS AMENDED? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. HM I DID JUST MAKE A STATEMENT BEFORE ABOUT WITHDRAWING THE BILL CONSIDERATION -- TODAY AT THIS HEARING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. I'D. MADE A REQUIRED JUST INDICATED THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING THE BILL FROM CONSIDERATION OF TODAY'S HEARING. I'M DISAPPOINTED -- BUT YOU'RE DOING THIS -- YOU AND I HAVE GONE BACK AND FORTH ON US. AND WE STAYED UP EXTREMELY LATE. AND STARTED VERY EARLY THIS MORNING [inaudible] AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOT A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ANY DEBATE. AND TO PUT FORTH. AMENDMENTS TO A COMMITTEE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE'S INPUT. IT'S A BIT UNFAIR -- OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. WERE THE EXACT [inaudible] TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OBAMA RULE. AS AS WRITTEN. BUT BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. VERY VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. AND THAT WOULD SET A FOUNDATION. FOR A CONVERSATION. TO CONTINUE. FOR I MEAN THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IT'S ABOUT A DEBATE. IT'S ABOUT GIVE AND TAKE. IT'S ABOUT COMING. TO A PRODUCT. THAT DOES WHAT WE THINK IT SHOULD DO. NOW YOU KNOW I BOTH AGREE. THAT WE NEED A NOT ENTIRELY NEUTRALITY BILL. AND I WANT A NET NEUTRALITY BILL BUT PUT FORTH. A FEW PAGES. AND SAY THIS MIRRORS. FOUR HUNDRED PAGES. OF WHAT I INTERPRET. AS AN FCC RULE. IT'S A BIT UNFAIR TO WILL COMMITTEE. BECAUSE WE NEED THE BENEFIT THE ALSO [inaudible] START THIS [inaudible] THIS CONVERSATION. I'M WILLING TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. BUT I THINK IT'S A BIT UNFAIR. TO ASSUME THAT THIS COMMITTEE I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT NOW. I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. AND I THINK YOU SHOULD. AT THE PLATFORM TO JUST BEGIN THIS CONVERSATION. NOW WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT OF THE CLASS -- WHEW THE PAST MIDNIGHT AND WE STARTED PRETTY EARLY -- AND LET'S BE CLEAR. WE HAVE FOUGHT IN PUSH BACK ON INDUSTRY. TO GET A NET NEUTRALITY BILL AND EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. I CAN'T SPEAK THE REPUBLICANS EXPECT FOR THE DEMOCRATS ARE COMMITTED. THE GETTING OUT INTO TO IT NEXT HOLIDAY BILL AND WORKING WITH YOU [inaudible] BUT WE BOTH UNDERSTAND. HOW THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS AMENDMENTS? NOT THE MEMBERS COMING TO A COMMITTEE [inaudible] NOW. HAVING SAID THAT I THINK YOU STILL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. YOU CAN CHOOSE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION OR YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING A CONVERSATION. AND IT'S BUT IT'S FOR THAT REASON ONLY THAT I WOULD I WOULD ASK FOR A MOTION. AND A SECOND THE MOVE THE BILL AND WE CAN CONTINUE. HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. WE ARE UP AGAINST CERTAIN DEADLINES. THIS BILL IS DOUBLE REFERRED. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO CONTINUE EIGHT NET NEUTRALITY CONVERSATION. THAT LEADS CALIFORNIA. AGAINST WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE. IT'S TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. RATHER THAN TO BECOME A MARTYR. WITH NO BILL. SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK IF THERE WAS THE FIRST IN A SECOND YOU CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AFTER THIS AND WE COULD DEBATE. MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING A MARTYR. THIS IS ABOUT. ACTUALLY PROTECTING NET NEUTRALITY I AND I WILL SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED AS WELL. I REVIEW IT YOU AND I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND I CONSIDER YOUR FRIENDS AND WE OF WORK AND WE ARE FRIENDS AND WE'RE WORKING ON THREE OR FOUR OTHER ISSUES TOGETHER AND I AND AND WE ARE. WE ARE WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS HOUSING AND WILL CONTINUE AND EVERY OTHER ISSUE I THINK WE AGREE. ON BUT THE REALITY IS AYE THAT WE DID INDICATE A WILLINGNESS TO TO GIVE ON SOME AREAS OF THE BILL AND UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS THAT CAME FORWARD. ARE REMOVE KEY PROTECTIONS THAT WILL ALLOW THE ICE PEEVES TO ENGAGE AND THEN THAT IS HOW YOU VIOLATIONS THAT THEY HAVE ENGAGED IN THE PAST AND SO. I INDICATED THE BEGINNING THAT WE COULDN'T ACCEPT APPOINTED THAT THE COMMITTEE CHOSE EVEN BEFORE HEARING THE BILL. TO ABOUT THOSE AMENDMENTS I I'VE I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN HERE AS LONG AS SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE I GUESS TALKING BEFORE. IT SEEMS ARE REALLY IRREGULAR TO ME FOR A COMMITTED TO THAT BUT I'VE. I'VE SAID MY PIECE WE'VE ALWAYS COMPLEX AMONG THIS BILL -- IDEA I GAVE UP PARTS OF THE BILL AND SENATE ENERGY -- I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS GIVEN TAKE. BUT THE AMENDMENTS AT THIS COMMITTEE. IMPOSED THAT WERE ISSUED LAST NIGHT AND THAT WERE IMPOSED BEFORE HEARING TODAY ARE EXTREME AMENDMENTS AND GOT THE BILL AND THAT'S WHY COULDN'T. SO INCIDENT BE SENATOR I ITEM. I WANTED TO READ SOME POINTS IT CAME IN AT THE LAST OUR FROM SOME OF OUR RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. REGARDING THE CONCERNS OF THE BILL A HANDFUL OF FOLK BOTH SUPPORTING THE BILL AS YOU PRESENTED FROM MY DISTRICT AND A HANDFUL OF FOLKS OPPOSING IT. AS PRESENTED I'D I I DID WANT TO TO READ SOME OF THAT TO YOU GIVEN OPPORTUNITY THAT'S THE QUESTION. I'M LOOK I I AM INTERESTED IN CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU MAY NO LONGER WANT TO CARRY THIS BILL -- I'D BE HAPPY TO AND I DON'T KNOW THEIR THE COLLEAGUES ON THIS BIAS THAT WOULD JOIN ME IN TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS ISSUE -- TO FURTHER THE CONVERSE BECAUSE I THINK LIKE THE CHAIRMAN HAS STATED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. A NET NEUTRALITY -- DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ARE CONTINUING TO MOVE IN THE PROCESS AND SO I'D MAKE. A MOTION TO AMEND THE BILL AND AS AS AMENDED -- TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION FORWARD MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT IT'S WITH YOU -- AND NOT -- WITHOUT RIGHT BUT I'M WILLING -- TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE PUT MY NAME ON THE BILL AND CARRY FORWARD THE CONVERSATION -- AS IT. BEGINS HERE -- WE HAVE A SECOND THAT MOTION. THOUGHT WHAT'S THE MOTION. SO MY MOTION WOULD BE -- TO MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED AND I KNOW YOU -- FOR YOU'VE SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD I'M MORE THAN WILLING -- TO AT CARRY THE CONVERSATION FROM THIS POINT FORWARD WITH YOU I HOPE OR OR HOW OR WITHOUT THAT HAVE BECAUSE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A NET NEUTRALITY. DEBATE AND DISCUSSION CONTINUING TO MOVE I'M NOT GONNA GO. YET THE QUESTION IT BUT YES IN. I'LL LET YOU RESPOND TO THAT BUT IT'S ALSO UNFAIR FOR ME TO GO BACK. AND TELL COMMITTEE RIGHT BEFORE A COMMITTEE HEARING HEY LOOK AT ALL THE ALL THE BACK AND FORTH AND MAKE A DECISION RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ON OUR SIDE. IT'S ON IT WOULD BE UNFAIR FOR ME TO WALK A PIECE OF PAPER OVER YOU RIGHT NOW AND SAY. MAKE A DECISION. IT'S UNFAIR FOR ME TO NOW TO COME BACK TOWARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS POINT IN AND SAY AND MAKE A DECISION ON THIS. YOU MAY VIEW THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THROUGH YOUR LANDS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE SIMPLY. TO MOVE A CONVERSATION. FOR AND TO AND TO HAVE. STRONG NET NEUTRALITY BILL. YOU MAY YOU MAY ANSWER HIS QUESTION I WOULD PREFER NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH THAT FOUGHT BACK AND FORTH DEBATE FOR THE DECORUM OF THE HOUSE. A BIT YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT IF YOU MIGHT RESTATE YOUR QUESTION MISTER GARCIA DOWN THE QUESTION SO MY FIRST. THE HARMONIES THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL [inaudible] AS AMENDED. I WOULD ALSO. PUT ON THE TABLE WRITE THAT DOWN. IF YOU NO LONGER WANT TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD AS THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO PUT MY NAME ON THE BILL. AND WE HOPE THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION AS WELL. SO THAT KIND OF A SITE. POINT THAT I'M MAKING AN AND I DID WANT TO JUST READ OFF SOME OF THE LETTERS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM. RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE MARDIN'S EFFORTS QUESTION YES YES NO THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY I'VE INDICATED WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HOP AND THE COMMITTEE WILL DO IT'S GOING TO DO -- I'M ALWAYS ONE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS I'M YOU KNOW I AS YOU AND I HAVE HAD OF LIVE UP WITH MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. SO I'M NOT ONE THAT SAYS YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR ALL WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE CONVERSATIONS -- SO THAT DOTSON NEVER GOING TO BE AN ISSUE -- BUT I'M SORRY THAT. BUT MR LOW HER QUESTION THE COMMENT. YOU KNOW IF. THEY THINK YOU VERY MUCH MS CHAIR -- I WOULD JUST A SECOND THIS MOTION BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN HERE IS THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS THAT. I OFTENTIMES WHEN THERE IS A CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO POLICY IT APPEARS THAT. YOU HAVE BOTH SIDES IN IN IN UNIFORM AND IN UNISON AND OPPOSITION. TO THE MUST BE A SWEET SPOT. TO WHAT WE SEE HERE BEFORE US [inaudible] AND MY APOLOGIES I WAS PRESENTING IN SENATE ANY GOVERNMENT FINANCE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF THIS BILL DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD AS IS TODAY THAT WITH THEIR IS NO NET NEUTRALITY BILL. MOVING FORWARD IN THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE MISTER. CORRECT -- DELEON DID NOT PRESENT HIS BILL AND I CANNOT SPEAK FOR HIM WHETHER HE WOULD CONTINUE OR NOT CONTINUE SURE SO IT HAVING SAID THAT GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF ANY VEHICLE MOVING FORWARD WITH RESPECT IN NET NEUTRALITY. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE OF THE CITY STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKE A POSITION -- IN THIS FRAMEWORK AND WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY ON BOTH SIDES -- ABOUT THE POLICY RAMIFICATIONS OF INTERSTATE. I WAS OF THE AYE I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I THINK IT'S OUR OBLIGATION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STRONG POSITION IN THIS FRAMEWORK. I UNDERSTAND THE SENATOR WINNER YOUR PASSION ON THIS ISSUE BUT I WOULD IMPLORE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD. GIVEN THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT THEY'RE STILL ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AS TIMES MOVE FORWARD. TO ALLOW FOR THAT CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE TO OCCUR SO I ECHO THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE ABSENCE THE VEHICLE THAT PRET THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE US THERE WILL BE NO NET NEUTRALITY BILL. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS TO% CONSIDER IN THE GREATLY DESIRE AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF US IN ARKANSAS. HE'S ALSO WANT TO SEE THE SAME THING. AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE ALL WANT -- A STRONG THAT NEUTRALITY BILL TO MOVE FOR THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS MENTALITY AND AS WE RECEIVED OUR YOU KNOW IN OUR LETTER FROM. LEADER PELOSI AND ALSO FROM CONGRESSWOMAN AS TO FROM YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS ARE OR NEARBY AT LEAST ON THAT THEY ARE. DOING THIS BILL INCLUDING THE SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS OF THE OF COMMITTEE REMOVED IS VERY IMPORTANT -- I ALSO I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT CHAIRMAN AND I HAD WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST. A NUMBER OF WEEKS I AND WHEN -- THE CHAIR SHARED WITH US OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OUR LAST NIGHT. NO WE SPENT HOURS YOU KNOW QUICKLY GOING THROUGH AND SAYING WE CAN AGREE TO THIS WE CAN AGREE TO THAT WE CAN AGREE TO THIS WE CAN'T READ ABOUT SO WE HAVE. ABSOLUTELY BEEN WILLING TO HAVE THAT BACK AND FORTH I ALWAYS DO THAT ON AS HAVE WE YET -- ADD AND BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEY COMMITTEE YOU KNOW AMENDMENTS WERE AS PROPOSED AND AND THAT'S SORT OF WHERE WE ARE BUT WERE. YOU KNOW CONVERSATION IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING -- BUT I I BY SO TO MAKE CLEAR MY POSITION ON WHAT HAPPENS IF I MISS HIM AT MIDNIGHT ONE FINAL COME IT'S IT'S JUST AGAIN AS AN ARENA AYE. AS AND OFTENTIMES WE WE IT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T DEAL IN ABSOLUTES AND WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US NOW. IS EITHER AT IF YOU WITHDRAW YOUR BILL THERE IS NOTHING. BUT AT LEAST MOVING FORWARD WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE HAVE SOMETHING TO LEASE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. IN THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEES AND ALSO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND SO I JUST I'M GLAD MY LAST COMES IS JUST OUT OF EMPLOYER YOU TO HELP. TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT THEY IMPORTANCE OF AND I WITH WITH ONLY A FEW EXCEPTION ISSUES. LIKE -- PER INTO OUR COMMUNITY OR TWO WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE ETCETERA I IDEAL IN VERY FEW ABSOLUTES YOU CAN ALWAYS. OF WORK OUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORK I'VE DONE -- AND THE BILLS I PASSED -- WE'VE NEGOTIATED ON MANY MANY MANY BILLS AND I DON'T HAVE TAKE A PURIST POSITION AND SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT I'M NOT TAKING A PURIST POSITION A TWENTY TWO WE MADE CHANGES. WE'VE INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE MORE CHANGES -- BUT THESE AMENDMENTS GO FAR SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING A PURIST BECAUSE THAT REALLY WORKS. BUT MR SHIPP AYE I THINK I'D BUY A HAVE A DUTY HERE TOO TUBES BREED WITH YOUR PERMISSION SOME OF THE RURAL CONSTITUENTS THAT OF IMPARTED OUR OFFICE OVER THE LAST TO BE TWO HOURS AND IT WITH PERMISSION CHAIRMAN OF REACH AND THINGS OF RESPOND. TO QUESTION AS A IS A COMPLETE IS A CENTER OF US GOT WIENER FROM SAN FRANCISCO DOES NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE AND WORK IN RURAL CALIFORNIA WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS -- NO EMAIL WILL STREAMING NO GPS NO ONLINE ACCESS TO JOBS COMMERCE HEALTH CARE PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES EDUCATION AND AND THE WORLD. THE GENERAL RIGHTS -- THESE HAVE JUST THE SENATOR SAYS HE WANTS TO PROTECT FOR EVERYBODY BUT IN MANY PARTS OF RURAL CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE NO INTERNET ACCESS [inaudible] PROTECT. IT SAYS ARE YOU KNOW GET TO THE SAP. FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA IT WOULD ADD TO THE ALREADY HIGH COST TO PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS WERE COST TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE ARE EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER. THAN IN URBAN AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. WE ALSO KNOW THAT NETWORK OPERATIONS A REMOTE ROUGH TERRAIN ARE MORE COMPLEX AND THE COST ADDRESSED THE NEW NORMAL FIRE DANGER. LARGELY IN ROW AREAS INCREASE EACH DAY -- MOREOVER SP EIGHT POINT TWO WILL HARM CONSUMERS WILL ALREADY HAVE ACCESS BY TAKING AWAY POPULAR FREE DATA SERVICE PLANS THE MAKE STREAMING ANOTHER DEALER USES AFFORDABLE. FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS -- WITHOUT FREE DATA PLANS CUSTOMER BILLS COULD RISE BY AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THOSE ARE OF STATEMENTS FROM A ORGANIZATIONS BOTH FOR MORE MUSICIANS WILL BE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. ARE AND OTHER RULE ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR DISTRICT THESE ARE SOME OF THE LETTERS THAT CAME IN OVER THE LAST IN TWO HOURS AYE I THINK IT IT IT DEV MERITS YOU KNOW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO RESPOND. I APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON AND AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I FLORA TERMS OF YOUR BILL THAT YOU DID WITH ON THE ASSEMBLY. MEMBER AYE WE ARE CURRY IN AND OUT AND OTHERS OF YOU BIPARTISAN BILL TO TRY TO WITH THE TNC TO TRY TO EXPAND RURAL INTERNET ACCESS DIED IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY. CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL ON HOW THAT ACCESS -- IS UNACCEPTABLE I'VE THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO GET THAT ACCESS WHAT IT DOES MEAN FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW. DIED THE MORE RURAL YOU GET THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU HAVE. ONE INTERNET OPTION. I I HAVE FRIENDS WHO LIVE EVEN ENOUGH UNINCORPORATED PART OF CINEMA COUNTY WHICH I I WOULD I WOULD NOT CONSIDER TO BE CLASSIC WORLD IT'S STILL IN A VERY OR CLOSE TO ORGANIZE THEIR AND THEY ONLY HAVE ONE OPTION. AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WE'RE GETTING OUT INTO THE MORE AND MORE RURAL AREAS ONE OPTION AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OPTION AND THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER HAS THE POWER WITHOUT ANY TRILOGY TO SAY. YOU CAN GO HERE BUT YOU CAN'T GO THERE THAT DOTSON EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM NO TOADIES IN A BIGGER PROBLEM WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE. A COMPETITION NAM I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT HIGHER COSTS AND HARMING CONSUMERS OF FREE DATA AND I AM NOT IN ANYWAY COMMENTING ON THE BIG THE PEOPLE OR GROUPS TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU I KNOWN. NOTHING ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM OR WHAT IF. HEARING -- THIS HAPPENING ON THE ICE PIECE HAVE BEEN -- FUNDING BILL VERY WELL FUNDED CAMPAIGN IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING I KNOW I EACH OF YOU HAS BEEN TARGETED WITH TWITTER ADS AND FACEBOOK GUIDES. FROM A GROUP CALLED CAL INNOVATES Y. WHICH IS FUNDED BY A TNT. ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS GOING TO HARM CONSUMERS THIS IS TERRIBLE. JOHN AND I WOULD ALSO HAD A SENIOR CITIZENS WHO WERE BEING USED EITHER WROBEL CALLED HER PHONE BANKS -- SAYING -- YOUR BILLS ARE GONNA GO UP. YOUR BILLS ARE GONNA GO OUT WHICH IS FALSE. I AND IN TERMS OF THESE FREE DATA PLANS ARE THE FREE DATA PLANS CALLED ZERO RATING -- WHICH I HOPE IT'S ALSO IT'S CORPORATE SELF DEALING IT'S BASICALLY -- COMCAST OR AT INTO YOUR VERIZON SAYING IF YOU USE MY SERVICE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY. A DOZEN COUNTING INSERTED A COP IF YOU USE MY COMPETITORS SERVICE ACCOUNTS AGAINST YOU DID A COP IT'S A WAY OF PUSHING PEOPLE TO FAVORITE SERVICES. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE THESE PREDICT FUNDS ARE NOT TRULY FREE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. ZERO RATING ONLY HAS VALUE IF YOU KEEP THE DATA CAP LOW. IF YOU HIGH DATA COPS IF YOU UNLIMITED DATA PLANS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE PEOPLE NO ONE NEEDS PREDATE APPLIANCES YOU HAVE ALL THE DATA YOU NEED. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RESTRICTED OFF THESE ARE ZERO RATING PLANS. DATA CAPS OF GOING UP UNLIMITED DATA PLANS HAVE BECOME CHEAPER AND CONSUMERS GET TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE LOW DATA COPS AND ZERO RATING -- DAN DE A PARTICULAR FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS YOU IF I IF YOU IF I CAN AFFORD UNLIMITED A PLAN I CAN GO WHEREVER I WANT. IF I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY I HAVE TO PAY CAP AND THEY TELL ME. YOU CAN USE THESE PRODUCTS BUT NOT OTHERS AND WE HAVE ON THE WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY COLORS OF CHANGES CENTER FOR MEDIA AYE JUSTICE OUR WIDE ARRAY OF GROUPS THAT ADVOCATE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE PER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THAT HAD BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT ZERO RATING HARMS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS -- SO YOU KNOW THAT DIED IS SO DO I THINK THE REALITY OF WHERE WE ARE BUT I I DO RESPECT OTHERS USE OF YOUR CONCERTS I THINK FOR THOSE REASONS RIGHT THAT THAT YOU'VE JUST. RESPONDED AND FOR THOSE THAT I STATED FROM OXYGEN SO THIS CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE WE WE HAVE A FIRST WHAT IS IT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. WE HAVE A FIRST AND SECOND TO PASS THE BILL AS AMENDED -- THE CHAIRS RECCO IS AN AYE BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING. I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK INTO MASS CITY.

HE MEASURES ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BUT I'M GOING TO PRESENT THIRTEEN TWENTY SIX I AM SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S DISABLED CITIZENS. HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES SERVICES WHERE NO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION ALMOST ALWAYS BENEFITS THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THIS HAS BEEN TRUE OF THE TNC IS WHICH HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO DEAF AND BLIND PERSONS AS WELL AS ELDERLY. NEEDING EXTRA ASSISTANCE BUT WHEELCHAIR USERS ESPECIALLY NOT UNFOLDING MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR USERS HAVE NOTED A CLEAR LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SERVICES OF TNC PROVIDERS. MANY LOCALITIES LIKE SEATTLE AND CHICAGO HAVE ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY BY ASSESSING THE SURCHARGE ON TNC USED TO HELP PAY FOR ACCESSIBLE TRANSIT OPTIONS. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW STATES TO REGULATE TNC IS STATEWIDE THAT'S THE SOLUTION TO TNC DISABILITY ACCESS UNAVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE STATEWIDE COORDINATION. S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX MANDATES THE P. YOU SEE DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR TNC ACCESSIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING SS IN A FEE ON TNC USED TO FUND. ON DEMAND WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE SERVICES COLLEGE DISABILITY ACCESS. TO THE DNC'S SHOULD BE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY I HAVE WITNESSES AT SPEAKING SUPPORT WHICH CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND MY UP THE UPPER CHIN DUE TO SPEAK. I'M JOINT EFFORT WILL BE WAS A SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR'S OFFICE AND DISABILITY WHICH IS ACTUALLY EASY ABA COMPLIANCE OFFICE. FOR THIS CD OF SET AT SAN FRANCISCO. I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE A SELF FUNDED PROGRAM IN A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY -- HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ON DEMAND -- THAT ARE NOT LONGER AVAILABLE TO FOLKS USING NON FOLDING MOBILITY DEVICES SUCH AN ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR SCOOTERS. WHEN I FIRST COME WHEN I CAME TO SACRAMENTO JUST THIS MORNING? I HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY CHEN -- EVEN THOUGH THE WHERE EITHER. YOU KNOW -- ACCESSIBLE -- BY SAYS -- BAD DIGITAL TIMING I DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO TAP MY APP AND BE ABLE TO GET HERE IN RECORD TIME. THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT NEARLY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO WAS STILL ALLOW A CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED OF EQUAL UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION IN ACCESS TO SERVICES OF THIS SAME QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY HAS THE GENERAL POPULATION? NO MORE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL. I'M TRANSPORTATION IMMOBILITY AND OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO WHAT'S MEETINGS THAT AND AND IT'S THE WAY WEEKLY BARRACKS WERE ABLE. TO THRIVE IN OUR LIVES. FOR MANY OF THE HAS OF THE EXISTING THE EXISTING WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE NOT ADEQUATE AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT EQUIVALENT ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THE GOOD PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. DOESN'T WORK SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NOW I'M GONNA TELL A SHARE MY PERSONAL STORY. I'M IN THE EXPERIENCE OF ALSO HAD THEIR WHEELCHAIR USERS -- WHICH NO UNFOLDED. NON FOLDABLE WHEELCHAIRS IN OUR SUITS AND MANY OF US AND WORKING PROFESSIONALS WE FREQUENTLY EXTEND WORK MEETINGS ON SCHEDULES PROTECT ENTERED OUT WHAT ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. FOREVER ACCEPTABLE TRANSPORT A IS NOT AVAILABLE OR VIABLE -- THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE INTENTION BEING THURMOND WHETHER IMAGINE HAVING TO WAIT AT THE BUS STOP BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ADD TO YOUR ONLY OPTION. IS TO ACTUALLY TAKE A BUS THAT TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE IN THE RIGHT -- STILL AS A RESULT -- AS A RESULT -- WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IS THAT LAWSUIT IF THERE IS A COST OF TIME? PRODUCTIVITY MISSED OPPORTUNITY PERSON MUST STAMINA. HEALTH AND ALSO SOME GAMES REPUTATIONS AS PROFESSIONALS AND EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OUR NON DISABLED COLLEAGUES OR DOESN'T DOESN'T LAST -- WHAT NOT USING A NON FOLDABLE CRACKS DOWN WORK AT TEN A WORKING LUNCH AND THEN COME BACK -- TO THEIR MEETING -- WELL WOULD TRADE -- TO HAIL A RAMPED VEHICLE USING THE TNC OUT. OF THERE ARE NO WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLES ARE GONNA EVER AVAILABLE ON WEEKENDS CLOSE DESCENDS SO THERE IS NO SATURATION OR AVAILABILITY OF OF THE SERVICE. AS A HOUSE SO I AM A MOTHER AND THE MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG CHILDREN SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN ONE OF THEM WAS SPECIAL NEEDS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET TO THEM QUICKLY. OUT BECAUSE OF A SCHOOL EMERGENCY OR ELEMENTS AND FRANKLY THAT IS ONE OF THE TIMES I AM THAT I AM. MOSTLY ANGERED -- AND FRUSTRATED. I'M EITHER LOVE LAST MYSELF INCLUDED. POPPED OUT OF SOCIAL ACTIVITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENINGS AFTER DARK EITHER BECAUSE PUBLIC TRANSPORT HE'S NOT AVAILABLE -- LAWYER BECAUSE THEY OF SAFETY ISSUES. MANY OF US IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY SAID TO MYSELF COVER LEARN TO COMPENSATE ARE FOR THIS DAILY CHALLENGES AND PRE PLANNED AND THE AMOUNT OF PRE PLANNING. THAT GOES ON REALLY CREATES. A SENSUAL MENTAL HEALTH HAZARDS. THE POINT IS THAT NO INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE TO DO THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE EMULATE. S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS WE SEE STATEWIDE. TO ADDRESS THIS IN EQUITY. IN CALIFORNIA -- BY PROVIDING A VERY SPECIFIC FUNDING MECHANISM AND SOLUTIONS I AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A MANDATE FOR COMPLETE AND TIMELY RESULTS. I'M AND I KNOW THAT HAVE BROUGHT US BACK TO THE EIGHT THE A ON THE BED REALLY THIS IS WHAT WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO MAYBE CUT THAT DOWN AND GOES CONTINUE TO THE NEXT ON WITNESSES AND BE BRIEF ABOUT IT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT. EXTRA TIME BECAUSE IT WAS UNSETTLED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THINK. GOOD MORNING JOHN ROSS ON BEHALF OF LEFT -- WE OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING AT A COMMITTEE TODAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CENTER STAFF. HAD COUPLE MECHANICAL ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OUT I THINK WE'VE GOT CONCEPTUAL AGREEMENT ON THAT NOTHING -- EARTHSHAKING BUT I APPRECIATE THE SENATOR'S WILLINGNESS TO KEEP WORKING WITH US TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE SOME POSITION THAT IT WORKS CORRECTLY THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING AUSTIN A WITH WITH UBER -- WILL ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR COUNTERPARTS HERE SPIN OUT FANTASTIC WORK ON THE CENTERS OFFICE AND I THINK WE'VE GOT A PACKAGE OF AMENDMENTS THAT IS -- WORK WELL FOR US AND WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL TO SEE THOSE YOU KNOW CARRIED OUT AFTER UP WITH TO THE COMMITTEE PROCESS -- I'LL BE BRIEF BUT JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE -- EXPANDING ACCESS TO WILL CHECKS AS WELL VEHICLES THE CHALLENGE THAT MANY CITIES AND STATES I'VE STRUGGLE WITH STRUGGLE ADDRESS FOR DECADES AS TRANSLATION PROVIDERS. THAT USE ONDEMAND RIGHT TRAPS LIKE YOU WERE AT BECOME MORE UBIQUITOUS THE SAME CHALLENGES REMAIN HAS BEEN NOTED BY -- THAT WHEN THIS FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- WE TAKE ACCESSIBILITY SERIOUSLY AND ACOSTA WORKING UNABLE TO INCREASE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THIS IS INCLUDED. IMPLEMENTING TACKLING VOICEOVER AND TALK BACK. TO DRIVERS OR DEATH. WE ALSO PILOTING WITH PROGRAMS IN CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND OF MONEY POLICIES RUN NONDISCRIMINATION ACCESSIBILITY. UBER WAVE OPTION ENABLES WRITERS WHO USE NON FOLDING MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS TO REQUEST A RIDE FOR DRIVERS IN WAVES THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH RAMPS ARE LAUGHS. AND ALL DRIVERS ARE PARTNERING WITH UBER AGREED TO TRANSPORT WRITERS TO TRACK WHO TRAVEL WITH SERVICE ANIMALS THEY'RE ALSO EXPECTED TO ACCOMMODATE FOLDING WHEELCHAIRS WALKERS ANOTHER SYSTEM DEVICES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT FEASIBLE. REGARDING SPECIALLY EQUIPPED WAVES THE OBSTACLE HERE WITH THIS ISSUE IS THAT -- UBER LEFT CANNOT OWN VEHICLES USED BY DRIVERS AND DRIVERS INDIVIDUALLY DETERMINE WHEN WHERE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DRIVE. AS A RESULT WE NEED TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS -- TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE VEHICLES AND ACCESS THE WILL OF THE TO THOSE WAVES FOR DRIVERS WHO. WON PROVIDE RIDES INTO PERHAPS. I WOULD SECOND. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OF SUPPORT YET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBINSON WAS SHOT HERE IT'S WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRADES ASSOCIATION.

AND ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DAVID YOU HAVE MISTER CHAIR JUST -- I AM IN VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I JUST WANT TO MAKE A A POINT OF OBSERVATION THAT EVER EVEN WHEN I RECALL MY EXPERIENCE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- WE WOULD HAVE PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED PARA TRANSIT -- AND TRANSFUSION SERVICES THAT. EVEN WITH THAT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY WE HAD INADEQUATE SERVICES FOR THAT THIS DISABILITY AND AND DISABLED COMMUNITIES AND WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES ARE RELATIVELY NEWER. A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION WE SEE THE CHALLENGES THAT EXIST AND SO I THINK A RECOGNIZING THAT PATIENCE IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS -- BUT YET WE MUST CONTINUE TO MOVE TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE I WOULD MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THINK THINK THE COMMENTS OF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND AND HE'S ACTUALLY CORRECT IN. IN MY GOAL AND I THINK THE THE GOAL OF THIS ENTIRE EFFORT IS IN WHICH WE HAVE. EVERYONE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION EVERYONE THAT THAT AND THAT ARE PASSED TO MAKE IT WORK AT THE END OF THE DAY WHICH IS THE KEY WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE VIA INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. THE EQUIPMENT IN PLACE TO MAKE IT WORK BUT EVERYONE HAS TO BE -- IN AGREEMENT AND WE WILL BE WORKING TO MAKE TO GET TO THAT POINT I RESPECTFULLY ASK AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- NAM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX MOTION IS TO PASTA COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION. SANTIAGO AYE SANTIAGO AYE OBERNOLTE BONTA CERVANTES EDUARDO GARCIA HOLDEN KAMLAGER-DOVE. LOW AYE LOW AYE MAIENSCHEIN MATHIS PATTERSON QUIRK SILVA RODRIGUEZ. BOB BALL THAT MICHELLE A FUTURE THEY COMMIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER -- YOU MAY PROCEED ON S. B.. TEN FOURTEEN THANK YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS SP -- TEN FOURTEEN BEFORE I GET INTO WHAT SIMPLE WE START MATT MASK YOU IF YOU WOULD ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA OPEN WITH I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT'S IT ARTICULATED ME ANALYSIS. REMOVES THE HOW 2% GOAL -- SO NOW ALL GET INTO THE CONTENT OF THE BILL -- IT. TNC EASE OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES OR MOST OF US REFERRED IS RIDE HAILING SERVICE'S ARE GREATLY CONVENIENT AND MOST OF US UTILIZED THEM WE IT'S BENEFICIAL FOR SO MANY PURPOSES -- AND AS A RESULT MORE AND MORE FOLKS ARE USING THEM WHICH IS A GREAT THING AND WE HAVE COMMUNITIES. THAT. WHERE A INCREASING NUMBER OF THE VEHICLE MILES WITH? THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE DUE TO BUY. VEHICLES DEPLOYED BY OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES NO THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME WHERE FOSSIL FUEL VEHICLES ARE STILL THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE. OF AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS AND GREENHOUSE GAS TAILPIPE EMISSIONS. AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON HAVING VERY STRONG BOTH AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE PROTECTION GOALS SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS BASICALLY. ENGAGES OUR TNC COMPANIES AS PARTNERS IN HELPING CALIFORNIA MEET ARE VERY. LEGITIMATE GOALS FOR BOTH AIR QUALITY SO CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE PROTECTION -- MISTER BILL HOLD FOR ONE SECOND CERTAINLY WANT TO LIFT THE CALL AND HE TO TO SORT. I SB A TWO TO THE CHAIR WAS I S. B. EIGHT TWO TWO MOTION IS DEPOSITS AMENDED. TO COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION CERVANTES CERVANTES AYE. MEASURES SOME CALL YOU MAY CONTINUE I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU CHAIR. SO WHAT S. B. TEN FOURTEEN DOES IS IT ESTABLISHES A CLEAN MILES STANDARD. AND AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE P. YOU SEE. THE CPUC WHICH OBVIOUSLY HAS ALREADY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULATE OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES SO IT DOESN'T ESTABLISH ANY NEW THE THE PEW CRT HAS THAT AUTHORITY -- I'VE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY WITH OUR TNC COMPANIES AND BASED ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE TAKEN SOME SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE PART TARGETS. AND REPLACE. WITH A PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE WITH THE PC AND SETTING IN DETERMINING FAIR TARGETS BOTH THE PC AND THE OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD -- NOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT'S RAISED OCCASIONALLY IS THE FACT THAT THE TNC STONE OWN VEHICLES. AND THEY THE DRIVERS WHO UNIT WHO ARE IN EFFECT I'D DEPLOYED THROUGH THEIR PLATFORMS ARE NOT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SUCH ALL OF THIS IS TRUE -- BUT WE ALREADY S. A STATE HAVE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE WE ARE SUPPORTING AND SUBSIDIZING WHICH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MONEY TO SUPPORT CHARGING PUBLIC CHARGING THROUGHOUT THE STATES OR CHARGING OF VEHICLES THAT THIS WOULD. THIS BILL WOULD PROMOTE AND ADDITIONALLY REBATES. AND OUR REBATE PROGRAM INTO THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM. SPECIFIES THAT 25% OF THAT REBATE WOULD GO TO LOW INCOME DRIVERS NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. ARE -- WHILE TEN FOURTEEN MY BILL DOES NOT PUT THIS ONUS ON THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES TO ASSIST THE DRIVERS ON THEIR PLATFORM. UBER HAS JUST ANNOUNCED PILOTS IN SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO PAY A DRIVERS. OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT ARE DEPLOYED ON THEIR PLATFORM ONE DOLLAR TWO DOLLARS FIFTY MORE PER RIDE. SO THAT'S A PILOT THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE ALREADY ENGAGED IN. I'M. WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE TNC COMPANIES ON FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WE MIGHT TAKE IN ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION SO WE MEET READ REGULARLY WITH THEM. BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WILL MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND AS I SAID GLADLY TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD LIKE MY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT TO NOW TESTIFIED. I'M JUST WE COULD BE AMENDED SHOULD BE TAKEN TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE S. AND WE WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE THE BILL THE MOVE FORWARD SIMPLY BECAUSE WE MISSED DEADLINES IF WE DON'T YES. BAG GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS QUIBBLE SOME HALF OF VALLEY CLEAN AIR NOW WE ARE A NONPROFIT THAT ADMINISTERS THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM -- IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT SINCE LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE HELPED LOW INCOME RESIDENTS LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES REPLACE OVER A THOUSAND OLDER HIGH POLLUTING VEHICLES. WITH MORE EFFICIENT OR ZERO MISSION ONCE -- CLEAN CARS FOR ALL YOU KNOW HELPS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS ACCESS ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- BY PROVIDING UP TO NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR -- STAY INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO SCRAP THEIR OLDER CAR AND TO PURCHASE A A CLEANER ALTERNATIVE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD ABOUT. FUNDING THIS PROGRAM CONSISTENTLY YEAR AFTER YEAR GIVEN THE BENEFITS IT PROVIDES TO LOW INCOME FOLKS. AND GIVEN THE RISE OF POPULARITY WITH TNC ISN'T THAT'S THE RISE OF THE ENTITIES WE DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THIS INDUSTRY TO PLAY IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND HELPING US ACHIEVE OUR AIR QUALITY IN CLIMATE GOALS -- THE CLEAN BECAUSE FOR ALL PROGRAM REALLY IS AN EXISTING TOOL AS A MISS SKINNER WAS REFERRING -- TO THAT CAN HELP ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE GOALS. OF THIS BILL. AND YOU KNOW THESE INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT HELPING -- ATTRACTING LOW INCOME DRIVERS TO EVE HE'S IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE THINK IT CAN BE M. A PRETTY EFFECTIVE TOOL ACTUALLY HELPING. LOOK MORE LOW INCOME DRIVERS REPLACE OLDER VEHICLES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY QUALIFY FOR USE -- ON THE TNC PLATFORM AND DOES GIVE THEM A VEHICLE THAT WILL QUALIFY AND GIVE MORE LIT LOW INCOME FOLKS BETTER ACCESS -- TO IN OF DRIVING FOR SO PRACTICALLY SPEAKING WE THINK THE TOOLS ARE THERE FOR THE STATE TO USE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT WHAT IS BEING OUTLINED IN S. B. TEN FOURTEEN AND THAT'S WHAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE. VOTE. JULIE MOUNT ASK BOBBY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION ACTUALLY TO BUILD ON WHAT MISTER BLISS JUST SAID -- EDUCATION AND AWARENESS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS WE HAVE TO REACH IN OURS HAVE GOALS AND WHAT BETTER POSITION ARE TNC DRIVERS AND TO BUILD THAT EDUCATION AWARENESS WHEN A DRIVER GETS IN A CAR. THAT IS A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE IT IS SEEN THAT IT'S PRACTICAL IT COULD BE USED FOR THEIR EVERYDAY PURPOSES AS WELL. SO WE WOULD SAY ALL THE STATE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY INVESTED IN THE ONES THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THEY ACTUALLY WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN EDUCATION AWARENESS IS ACTUALLY A PART OF THE THE PROGRAM. THAT WE SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE AND SUPPORT NAME AFFILIATION IMPOSITION ONLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN WHITE WITH THE CLEAN POWER CAMPAIGN WE SUPPORT THE BILL. HI WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION pCATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING CINEMA CLEAN POWER AND SUPPLY. JASON VARGAS WITH A UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS IN SUPPORT. ARIEL HAMEL ON BEHALF CAL START ME ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. STILL THE ASSEMBLY SHAMI HAVE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND ON BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY INSTRUCTS. CATHERINE GARCIA WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. I CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO MEMBERS -- AWESOME HE WITH UBER -- WE'RE IN AN OPPOSE LET'S AMENDED POSITION AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- WHILE WE SUPPORT THE EXPANDED USE OF UAVS AND AGREE RIDE SHARING HAS STRONG POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS TOWARDS MORE SHARED ELECTRIC MOBILITY. WOULDLEAVE THE BILL IMPRINT ONE UNNECESSARILY HARM RIGHT SHARING AND WRITE YOUR DRIVER'S WHICH ARE SIMPLY A SUBSET OF OVERALL ROAD USERS WITHOUT MAKING INTENDED PROGRESS TOWARDS THE INTENDED. VARMA OUTCOMES WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE BILL NOW HAS A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT BETTER CAPTURES TNC IS CLIMATE IMPACT. THROUGH WHICH TRANSITION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES A CORE COMPONENT. HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN IT SIGNIFICANCE EARNS A REMAIN AS BE TEN FOURTEEN SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON INCENTIVIZING AND CLEARING OBSTACLES FOR THE DESIRED OUTCOME. MORE SHARED ELECTRIC MILES AND LOWER EMISSIONS THE WRITER SECTOR. THESE OBSTACLES INCLUDE THE FACT THAT EVEN THE TNC TRAVIS TODAY ARE OFTEN WERE SOFTER TO RANGE LIMITATIONS. DOWNTIME WAITING TO CHARGE THEIR VEHICLES AND THE LACK OF PUBLIC PASSED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AMONG OTHERS. WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT MAKE YOU THESE MORE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE DRIVERS OF POTENTIALLY EARN LESS THAN ANY OF THE COLLECTIVELY IMPROVING THESE ISSUES WILL NATURALLY DO MORE EASE ONTO PAN LEFT. ANY REASON BECOMING MORE COMPETITIVE CHOICE. THE CURRENT BILL TARGETS ONLY TEENS EVE SEE VEHICLES WITHOUT FAILING TO LEVERAGE ANY POLICIES THAT WOULD CAPITALIZE ON THE POTENTIAL RIDE SHARING OFFERS. I CENTER SKINNER MENTIONED UBER ANNOUNCED A NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INVOLVING FOUR MAJOR CALIFORNIA CITIES IN WHICH UBER EVEY DRIVERS. WILL RECEIVE INCENTIVES FOR TRIPS COMPLETED ANY OF THESE ADDITIONALLY MILLIONS OF WRITERS WILL BE PROVIDED EDUCATION MATERIAL IN ONLINE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BENEFITS OFFERED BY YOU HE'S DEVELOP BY LEADING EXPERTS. WE'RE LEVERAGING A PLATFORM TO DO THE BIGGEST TV WRITING DRIVE OVER THE NEXT YEAR WITH THE GOAL OF COMPLETING FIVE MILLION TV TRIPS. WE'RE DOING THIS TO LEARN WHAT WORKS AND BOOST EDUCATION AWARENESS AS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS WITNESS -- RIGHT TRAIN HAS AN ABSOLUTE ROLE TO PLAY HERE AT ALONG THE LINES OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S GOAL OF GETTING TO FIVE MILLIONS AS BY TWENTY THIRTY IN THE RAMP UP TOWARDS THAT. CAN HAVE A LOT GREATER IMPACT AN OFFSET MORE MISSIONS IF WE INVITE AND INVOLVE MORE PEOPLE AT THOSE ADS ARE USING TO SHARE CAPACITY -- BASIC IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THE TNC TODAY ACCORDING TO PIECE YEAR PORT CANNOT THE CAME ON APRIL ARE STILL LISTEN 2% OF YOUNG TEEN CALIFORNIA AND LESS THAN 1% LESS THAN HALF A PERCENT OF OVERALL EMISSIONS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR -- SO IN ADDITION TO THE AMENDMENT REFERENCE IN THE HOUSES WERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR HOPING TO SEE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THESE GOALS. DEVELOP BY CARBON THE P. YOU SEE ARE TIED RELATED MARKING CONDITIONS ARE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. AND DIRECT ONGOING STATE PLANNING EFFORTS AND FUNDING PROGRAMS ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THIS BILL. ENCOURAGE PARTNERSHIPS ROUTINES USING UTILITIES AND CHARGING AND CHARGING PROVIDERS THAT WILL HELP LINE. BUT NOT AS WELL WITH WITH THE GOALS OF THIS BILL. AND LASTLY ENSURE THESE PROVISIONS ALSO PLAYED A CURRENT FUTURE RIGHT ENTRANCE AND THE WRITER SPACE AS THE MARK AS THE INDUSTRY ITSELF IS RAPIDLY CHANGING. SO LOOK FORWARD WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE IMPROVE THIS PROPOSAL AND SET A PATH A RIGHT TURN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CALIFORNIA ELECTION FAKE ELECTRIFICATION GOALS THANK YOU. THE SHERMAN MEMBERS DON'T INFECTIOUS REPRESENTING LEFT-- ECHO AUSTIN'S -- COMMENTS ONE I THINK THE SENATOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL WE SHARE MANY OF THE GOALS -- IT IT EMBODIED IN THE BILL. WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A WAY TO GO PRINCIPALLY AROUND THE LANDING. INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT MANY OF THE FOLKS TALK ABOUT TODAY -- VARIOUS POTS OF MONEY TO LINE THEM WITH. T. IN SEASON HOW WE ULTIMATELY GET THERE WE WANT TO BE WE WANNA PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN THIS WHERE WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I'M WE WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO A WHAT WERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. I LIKE TO OPEN THE OPEN THE ROLE ON EIGHT TWO TWO S. B.. EIGHT TO TWO HOLD FOR A SECOND. S. B. EIGHT TO TO DUE PROCESS AMENDED TO PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION [inaudible] BONTA [inaudible] HOLDEN [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE I RODRIGUEZ. SEVEN TWO MEASURES UP. JERRY SANTIAGO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS UNTIL KELLY ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION THE NATION NOT WIDE NETWORK OF STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADVANCE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. WERE TESTIFYING TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO SB TEN FOURTEEN WELL WE APPRECIATE EFFORTS TO SPUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION IN THE STATE S. B. TEN FOURTEEN DOES LITTLE IN THE WAY OF HELPING HARDWORKING CALIFORNIANS MAKE ENDS MEET. INSTEAD IT PLEASES UNREALISTIC DEMANDS ON DRIVERS ESPECIALLY THOSE OF MODEST MEANS AND THREATENS TO UP AND THE FLEXIBLE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WRITERS HAVE PROVIDED. 50% OF DRIVERS ON THE LEFT PLATFORM OUR LOW INCOME 93% DRIVE FEWER THAN TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK THERE ALSO TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES TO THE AIMS OF S. B.. TEN FOURTEEN POOR VEHICLE RANGE LACK OF TV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ALL MAKE IT HE'S IMPRACTICAL FOR RIDE SHARE DRIVERS WHO CANNOT PREDICT WHERE THEIR NEXT RIDES WILL TAKE THEM -- OVER OR UNDER IT UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO SPEND THE ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIRED TO RECHARGE DURING THEIR DRIVE RIGHT CHIANG TIME -- AS WE TEN FOURTEEN UNFAIRLY PENALIZES HARDWORKING TNC DRIVERS POTENTIALLY PUSHING THE VAST MAJORITY WHO DO NOT HAVING CANNOT AFFORD AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE OFF THE PLATFORM. AND HITTING LOW INCOME MINORITY GROUPS THE HARDEST WE HUMBLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ONCE AGAIN NAME AFFILIATION POSITIONALLY. HI MY NAME IS ALICIA GONZALEZ ON THE PROWL DRIVE FOR LIFT AND I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. LET'S SEPARATE REPRESENTING THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN OPPOSITION. LARA BUT IT WITH TECHNICALLY THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED PETITION. WE S. OR THORN CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED. KEVIN MCKINLEY WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED [inaudible] BOB. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO LOOK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF AN A FIRST US ALL THIS BILL I WAS ACTUALLY QUITE DELIGHTED -- WITH THE THE CONCEPTUAL NATURE OF WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND AS YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE DISTINCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER FOR HIGHER TRANSPORTATION ALSO TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF TWO AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE POLICIES IN PLACE FOR THAT SIMILAR TYPE OF INCENTIVES -- CAN YOU GIVE A SENSE ON THE FROM AS THE AUTHOR THE LET'S ENDING THAT. DISCREPANCY IN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF TNC EASE AND ENSURING THAT WE WANT. TO GET TO A CERTAIN GOAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT THE INCENTIVES ARE IN PLACE FOR SIMILAR OTHER FOR HIGHER TRANSPORT. SO A COUPLE SPECIFICS ONE THE BILL IS NOT THE IS WRITTEN TO ON MILES SO IT WOULD NOT. NECESSARILY AFFECT ALL DRIVERS ON THE PLATFORM OR ALL VEHICLES ON THE PLATFORM THE REAL. POINT IN A FOR THINKING OF IT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW WAS CERTAINLY THE THE STATE HAS. A VERY AMBITIOUS FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE CALL AND IF WE ARE JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT THERE WOULD ONE AFFECT ALL VEHICLES AND ALL DRIVERS ON THE PLATFORM. BUT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO BALANCE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SOME DRIVERS THAT YOU KNOW REALLY ONLY USE ONLY DRIVE -- FOR TNC VERY FEW HOURS A WEEK AND PROBABLY VERY FEW MILES AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHY DO WE HAVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOAL BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT TAILPIPE EMISSIONS SO WHERE WE GETTING THE MOST TAILPIPE EMISSIONS. FROM THE VEHICLES THAT ARE DRIVING THE MOST MILES SO THAT'S WHY I'VE DESIGNED THE BILL TO BE TARGETED TOWARDS MILES SO WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT ONLY THOSE DRIVERS WHO ARE REALLY. USING THEIR VEHICLE IT FROM MANY MORE HOURS AND MANY MORE MILES ON A TNC PLATFORM NOW ADDITIONALLY. BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY RECENT -- ADVANCES IN TERMS OF SOME MODELS WITH GREAT RANGE AND IT'S A LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE OLD VERSION NEED THESE THAT HAS VERY LIMITED RANGE IT REALLY DOES PUT YOU AT A DISADVANTAGE. BUT THE BILL HAS THESE MILES TARGETS AS VERY GRADUAL AND IS NOW DESIGNED TO ALLOW BOTH THEY ARE BEING P. YOU SEE DE DETERMINED. WHAT IF TO FACTOR IN THINGS LIKE THE AVAILABILITY OF VEHICLES WITH A WIDE RANGE SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THE MARKET CONDITIONS ARE SUCH? THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THE GOALS THEN THEY WILL BE DELAYED OR THEY WILL BE MODIFIED SO I'VE STRIPPED WHAT THE SPECIFIC GOALS ARE TO ALLOW. TO FACTOR IN THOSE MARKET CONDITIONS ADDITIONALLY THE BILL AND YOU DIDN'T ASK THIS QUESTION IF YOU TURN TO NINE PAGE NINE OF THE BILL. IT SPECIFIES THAT THE DAY WILL NEED TO ENSURE A MINIMAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME DRIVERS SO AGAIN. THAT THIS NOTION THAT THIS BILL WOULD UNFAIRLY HARM THE LOW INCOME DRIVERS IT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO FACTOR THAT. AND AS I INDICATED BEFORE OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS WHERE THE STATE HAS INVESTED TO HELP MEET OUR GOALS. TARGET SPECIFICALLY. LOW INCOME DRIVERS TO HAVE THEM BENEFIT MOST SO. I THINK HOPEFULLY THOSE HER ADDRESSING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU RACED. YES SIR OF A MY MISTER TO A PART OF THE CHALLENGE I THINK AGAIN THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OF FOR HIRE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES. OTHER NUANCES BETWEEN THEM AND UNDERSTANDING THE POLICIES DON'T NECESSARILY FIT IN -- AND WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT THAT YOU HAVE I DO THINK THAT'S MERITS FURTHER CONVERSATION TO MOVE FORWARD AND I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I DO. APPRECIATE THE INTENT BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL. SAYS TO IDENTIFY THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THAT OF THE INCENTIVES IN TRYING TO MAKE IT ALSO WORK OF IT BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE THESE TREACHEROUS NETWORK COMPANIES ALSO COMPLY AND ALSO JOIN US IN OUR IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS -- SO I I AM I AM HOPEFUL THAT YOU'LL STAY COMMITTED -- IN THE GOOD FAITH TO THAT AS WELL SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE THE BILL. FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. MEMBERS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP. SENATOR OF SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL -- I'M WONDERING FIRST DO WE PUT A SIMILAR REQUIREMENT ON THE COMPANIES THAT THESE TNC EASE COMPETE WITH LIKE TAXI COMPANIES OF LOS. I'M WE THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS NOW AND FLEET OWNERS. I IN FACT I CARRIED A BILL FOR WITH THAT WHERE THE A ARE BEING NOW BOTH THE STATE FLEET MUST MEET A CERTAIN PERCENT OF THESE ZAPS. AND ARB IS NOW IN POWER TO IMPOSE THAT ON PRIVATE SECTOR FLEETS THEY'VE NOT DONE THE REGULATORY ACTIONS YET BUT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. AND TAXIS IN MANY CASES ARE CONSIDERED A FLEET SO WE HAVE THAT FOR FLEETS AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. THAT HAVE IMPOSED EVEN STRONGER GOALS THE NO WHAT'S IN THIS BILL ON THEIR TAXI FLEETS BUT AS WE KNOW FOR ITS JUST FOCUS ON TAXIS FOR THE MOMENT. THEY ARE A SHRINKING PORTION OF OF SO FOR RELIEF TRYING TO DEAL WITH -- WHAT ARE THE LARGEST GROWTH OF VMT IN OUR COMMUNITIES OTHER THAN JUST YOU AND I INDIVIDUALLY DRIVING -- THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY PRIVATE SECTOR FLEETS AND AND IN SOME CASES TNC SO THERE IS NOW IN STATUTE THE ABILITY. FOR A ARE BE TO IMPOSE AT SIMILAR THINGS AND WILL BUT WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF RULE MAKING THE DO OKAY THE IT'S I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE NEVER PUT ITS FINGER ON THE SCALE OF OF ONE AND NOT OTHERS WHICH IS WHY I READ THE BILL'S REGARDING FLEETS LAST YEAR AND A PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. SURE WYOMING OUT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS THAT IF IT WERE. A AFFECTING THE ABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A SOMETHING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING -- I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN BECAUSE AND TO ME THAT THE TNC IS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW BECAUSE THEY'RE THE VEHICLES DON'T BELONG TO THEM THEY'RE NOT REALLY FLEET OPERATORS THERE. THOSE VEHICLES BELONG TO THE DRIVER'S WEAPON TO APPLY TO BE -- DRIVERS FOR THE TNC AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE FROM MY OWN HOMETOWN -- I THINK WE HAVE. ONE TNC DRIVER. AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A LIFT OR A COOPER YOU ARE JUST AT THE MERCY OF WHETHER NOT HE'S GOT HIS APPLICATION OPEN RIGHT. AND I I REPRESENT ARE I MEAN I THE SECOND LARGEST DISTRICT IN THE STATE I I I HAVE A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXACTLY THAT SAME SITUATION AND MY FEAR IS THAT BY. IMPOSING THIS REQUIREMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT. THE ABILITY OF THOSE DRIVERS STEPHEN DRIVE FOR THE TNC CAN TNC MIGHT HAVE TO TELL THOSE DRIVERS OF THEY DON'T HAPPEN TO OWN A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO TELL THOSE DRIVERS I'M SORRY. WERE ALREADY AT OUR LIMIT AND YEAH YOU CAN'T DRIVE FOR US SO BUT THAT'S WHILE AFTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. ANY FOR THE QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS.
