AND THAT.

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:43.827
LIKELY WILL HAVE THE RESULT OF

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:51.354
IS THE FACT THAT.

IN ONE YEAR ALONE.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.075
THIS BILL IGNORES ANY

CONSIDERATION OF REVENUE.

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.346
WE WOULD REQUEST THAT.

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.448
THERE BE SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.450

OF OF STARTING --

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.604
BUT THAT PROGRAM ALSO.

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:43.439
DIVIDE COST BASED ON VOLUME NOT

ON REVENUE.

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.745
GENERICS ARE 90% OF WHAT IS

[inaudible]

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.115
AND NATIONALLY.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:54.884

GENERIC MANUFACTURERS.

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.973
IN THE ANALYSIS THIS BILL COULD

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.175
YOU TAKE ABOUT ONE MORE MINUTE

JUST ABOUT DONE OKAY --

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:23.780
ONE I IN THE ANALYSIS OF THIS

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.748
BILL IT TALKS ABOUT THE

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.784
INCREASING COST OF DRUGS --

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.386
AS ONE OF THE SCOPES OF NEED FOR

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:31.521
THIS BILL.

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.756
OUGHT TO SHOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.191
DRUGS OUT THERE ARE GOING UP.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:36.726
YET THE BILL COMPLETELY IGNORES

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.494
THE COST OF DRUGS.

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:42.065
AND THE LOWER COST DRUGS NGUYEN.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.698
THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING ASKED THE

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.400
PAID.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:45.301
FOR THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.203
ACHIEVING SOME THIS [inaudible]

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.105
EDUCATION.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:51.040
OF BOTH PRESCRIBERS AND PATIENTS

WELL I I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT IT

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.708
SHOULD BE THE MANUFACTURE

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.276
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING SOME OF

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.911
THESE MEDICATIONS AREN'T.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:05.280
MADE HERE AND TO GO AFTER THEM

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.349
IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT IN A PART

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.485

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.529
TO OR MAY STILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.064
DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.832
THE COST SHARE BURDENS ON

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.200
DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.602

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:30.706
HOPE THAT AS THIS.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.708
AS THIS MOVES FORWARD AND WE SEE

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.710
HOW THIS ALL COMES TOGETHER THAT

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.411
THERE BE THAT SENSE OF EQUITY

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:37.312
AND THERE BE THAT SENSE OF

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.248
RESPONSIBILITY ME WE ARE TRUE

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.750
THIS IS TRULY A TRANSFORMATIVE.

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.719
UP BILL ON DEALING WITH

01:13:43.786 --> 01:13:45.454
PHARMACEUTICALS AND SHARKS I

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:46.321
MEAN THAT THERE IS NEVER BEEN

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.991
ANYTHING LIKE THIS SO WE ARE WE

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.993
HAVE TRIED TO ANTICIPATE A LOT

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.561
OF THOSE PROBLEMS.

01:13:52.628 --> 01:13:55.130
AYE AND A RESPONDBUT THAT

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.231
DOESN'T MEAN WE FIGURED IT ALL

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.167
OUT AND WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS

01:13:58.233 --> 01:13:59.935
KEEP IT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SO THAT

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.371
WE CAN COME BACK AS NECESSARY.

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:03.705
TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS I

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.140
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE COST TO

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:07.576
THE GENERIC THE CAUSES PROGRAM'S

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.178
REALLY MINUSCULE --

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:11.313
RECOGNIZING THAT THE THAT THE

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.015
PROFIT MARGIN ON GENERICS IS

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:15.083
LESS THAT IT DOES RELATIVELY

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:17.019
IMPACT THEM A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.721
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT --

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.623
TO LESS THAN HALF A PENNY PER

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.759
EVERY PRESCRIPTION --

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.260
SO -- AFFAIR

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.461
EVERY PRESCRIPTION DOLLAR I

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:28.497
SHOULD SAY SO IT'S IT'S A VERY

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.566
SMALL AMOUNT BUT WE WERE TRYING

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.434
TO GET THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:34.102
THE WHOLE PRODUCTION LINE. TO

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:36.972
RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ONLY.

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.340
PROVIDING ACCESS TO THESE

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.409
MEDICATIONS IN THESE AYE

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:41.643
INSTRUMENTS THEY HAVE TO TAKE

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:42.878
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY'VE GOT

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:43.979
A WHEN THEY'RE DONE WITH THEIR

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.347
USEFUL LIFE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.348
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.817
AND THEY ARE DANGER.

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:52.287
ALRIGHT WELL I IT LIKE LIKE

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.755
EVERYONE'S BEEN SAYING I I THINK

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:54.756
THE KEY HERE --

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.693
THE IS THAT WE ARE MOVING GO.

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:58.894

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:17.539
IN THE BILL IT IS LEFT UP TO

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:18.907

THAT WORKS OR THEY CAN --

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.981
THERE'S ROOM FOR THEM TO COMPLY

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:27.649
THEM INDIVIDUALLY --

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.851
THERE IS EXISTING PRECEDENT

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:32.020

UP IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:48.136

COST ALLOCATION SHOULD BE --

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.286
SO ALL THE COMPANIES AS WE WOULD

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.068
THE COMPANIES.

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:21.770

THAT'LL BE THE SAME AGREEMENT

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:24.339
WHEN WE GO TO THE STATE WHY

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:39.855
HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE SO IT IT

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.056

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:43.492
THE BILL ASIDE THE BILL IS

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:46.795
SILENT SO IF PEOPLE.

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.196
SO THERE'S NINE PROGRAMS NOW

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:49.698
ENDING NOW A STATEWIDE PROGRAM

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:52.200
THAT COULD BE NEW NEGOTIATIONS

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.770
