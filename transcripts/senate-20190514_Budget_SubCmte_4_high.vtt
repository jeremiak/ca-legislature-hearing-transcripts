00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.233
SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.468
DETERMINE WHAT WHICH OF THOSE

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.170
USES ARE GOING TO BE ANALYZED NO

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.005
JUDGE CARTER HAS.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.241
SOME IDEAS THE COUNTY HAS SOME

BEFORE YOU TODAY IS JUST.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.022
TO ANALYZE THE SITE.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:45.391
SO YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY SIMILAR

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.359
ITS FIRST STEP THAT WE TOOK WITH

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:47.059
CINNAMON WHERE BEFORE YOU CAN

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:49.896
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:50.563
POSSIBLE YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.863
IT.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.064
SO WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE SITE

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.432
WHAT IS THE CONDITION THE

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.233
BUILDINGS WHERE THE

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.801
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT ARE THE

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:57.970
HAZARDS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.405
MEAN WOMEN.

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:00.239
AND SOME IS ACTUALLY GREAT CASE

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:02.041
STUDY IN THE THINGS WE FOUND THE

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.042
WAY TO DECIDE ASSESSMENT THAT

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:03.376
HELP INFORM.

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.677

ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.586
SO THIS FIRST STEP IS REALLY

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:15.321
DETERMINE WHAT.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.356
CURRENT SITE CONDITIONS ARE

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:17.657
WHICH WOULD.

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.225
FORM THAT YOU TO DISCUSS ABOUT

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:20.226

ABOUT WHAT MAY EXIST IN THE

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.100
FUTURE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.770
FOR EXAMPLE THE THE SOIL --

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:34.140
BUILDING THAT KIND OF THING.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.575
YES I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.244

WOULD BE THINGS LIKE A

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:44.550
REASONABLE DEAL -- GEOLOGICAL

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:47.019
SURVEY TERM IN NOW IF THERE'S A

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.288

KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE IT WILL

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:04.337
BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THAT

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:05.438

BECAME CLEAR.

00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:46.271
ARE HOW MIGHT THESE FUNDS BE

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:48.172

APPROPRIATION -- THERE WERE

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:05.657
DELAYS AND THAT WAS IN LARGE

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:06.224
PART BECAUSE OUR AGENCY WAS

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.859
GOING TO THE PROCESS OF DISCOUNT

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:09.427
AND IMITATION WHICH HAS --

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.829
BROUGHT AND A SLOWDOWN TO EVERY

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:15.166
ASPECT OF ALL OF OUR OFFICE IN --

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:16.567
GENERATING CONTRACTS

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:19.404
IMPLEMENTING CONTRACTS SAID THE

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.605
WHOLE SPECTRUM OF IT.

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:22.507
THESE A REIMBURSEMENT BASED

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:24.509
CONTRACTS SO THEY BE THE

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.311
COUNTIES GET CONTRACTS THEY GO

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.479
THROUGH THEIR BOARD PROCESS AND

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.981
THEN THE IMPACT BUT SO. FOR US

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.450
TO GET HIM OUT THE DOOR WAS SLOW

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:32.917
BECAUSE OF OUR FISCAL

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.218
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:35.520
THEN ONCE WE GET INTO THE COUNTY

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:36.654
IS THE COUNTIES THEN HAVE TO GO

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.056
TO THEIR BOARDS AND GET THEIR

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.258
APPROVAL AND AND GO THROUGH

00:32:40.325 --> 00:32:41.426
THEIR MACHEN ASIANS AND THEN

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:42.393
THEY SEND IT BACK TO US.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:48.166
SO WE DO HAVE I BELIEVE -- FIFTY

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.068
OF THE FIFTY EIGHT M. CONTRACTS

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:50.968
RETURNS.

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:53.604
WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING REQUESTS

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:55.373
FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM THIS

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.408
COUNTY IS AN REQUEST THAT HAVE

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.876
BEEN MADE IN APPROVED BY OFFICE

00:32:58.943 --> 00:32:59.410
OUR OFFICE.

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:01.546
THOSE THEN GO TO THE STATE

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.714
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHICH THEN

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.948
HAS THEIR OWN PROCESS FOR

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.483
ACTUALLY USING THOSE.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:06.951
AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.386
WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING LOTS OF

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.754
REQUESTS FROM COUNTERED AT

00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:12.023
QUESTIONS FROM COUNTIES ABOUT.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.725
HOW THE REQUESTED?

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:14.258
THEY'VE BEEN VOICING THEIR

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:14.859
CONCERN ABOUT THE FIFTY FIFTY

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:16.194
MATCH IN THERE.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.296
THE RETICENCE ON SOME OTHER

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.565
BOARDS TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:21.165
BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.200
MONEY SO I THINK.

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:24.836
THIS ALLOCATION AND THE CHANGE

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:28.139
OF THE MATCH FOR A FIFTY FIFTY

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:28.773
TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WILL

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.876
REALLY SPEED UP.

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:34.579
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE THE OR

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.047
CERTAIN COUNTIES.

00:33:36.114 --> 00:33:37.248
WHOSE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:38.316
FINANCIAL.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:41.786
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY EXPLAIN --

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.187
YOU WILL SPEED UP WITH THE

00:33:43.254 --> 00:33:44.255
COUNTY THROUGH DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:46.357
FINANCIAL ISSUE AS FAR AS BEING

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:46.557
ABLE.

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:48.760
TO MAP.

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:49.761
OR FISCAL ALL THAT THE SLOW DOWN

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:50.561
BECAUSE OF THIS GAL.

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:52.563
WELL THE NON.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.265
THE COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:58.336
THE FINANCING TO BE ABLE TO DO.

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:00.171
THE MEADOW THERE'S A COUPLE

00:34:00.238 --> 00:34:00.805
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS IN THIS SO

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.874
THERE'S THAT IT BY TAKING UP A

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.209
FIFTY FIFTY MATCH TO A SEVENTY

00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:05.743
FIVE TWENTY FIVE MATCH IT

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.512
REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF THAT THEY

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:07.912
HAVE TO COME UP.

00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:09.013
AS A MATTER.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.947
THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER PROVISION

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.716
IN THIS THAT FOR THOSE COUNTIES

00:34:11.783 --> 00:34:13.184
THAT HAVE FIFTY OR FEWER

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.385
PRECINCTS.

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:16.621
THERE'S NO MATCH SO THAT I THINK

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:17.722
GOES A LONG WAYS FOR THOSE

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.891
SMALLER COUNTIES THAT REALLY ARE

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.159
GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:22.727
COMING UP WITH ANY ANY MATCH.

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.128
I'M AS I SAID OUR GOOD WE DO

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.798
HAVE CONTRACTS BACK FOR FIFTY OF

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:29.033
THEM -- AND HAVING THOSE IN

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.269
PLACE NOW MAKES THE

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.236
REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS.

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:33.971
AND MUCH.

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:35.606
NOW IS IT CAN BE DONE MORE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:41.546
EXPEDITED. FIFTY EIGHT OF THE

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:42.013
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.215
YOU HAVE A CONTRACT.

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:45.516

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.351
REIMBURSEMENTS.

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:48.486
WE HAVE THEIR CONTRACTORS IN DID

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.288
IT WITHOUT.

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:53.558
ON THE BASIS OF THE MATCH IT NOT

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:54.859
ON THE BASIS OF THE SEVENTY FIVE

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.461
TWENTY WRAPPED.

00:34:56.527 --> 00:35:00.565
SO WHY DO YOU NEED. SEVENTY FIVE

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:02.366
TWENTY FIVE YEAH [inaudible]

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:05.303
ALREADY AGREED.

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:06.704
ITS IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT THE

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.272
FIFTY FIFTY IN ALLOCATION THE

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:08.873
HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR WAS IN A

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.174
SUFFICIENT MATH IT WASN'T

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:11.576
SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THEM.

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:14.212
AND WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR THE

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.814
WHOLE ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE

ABOUT ON IT.

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.420
SO THIS MAKES A CONSISTENT WITH

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:25.523
OUR PREVIOUS REQUEST -- FOR THE

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:32.163
FULL AMOUNT OF AT A 7525% MATCH

GOSH THIS FIFTY FIFTY MATCH

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.470
WASN'T ENOUGH AND IT WITH ITS

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:40.471
WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:45.176
DO -- THEY NOT THEY ENTERED INTO

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.277
IT BUT KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING

WERE WORKING AT IDENTIFYING

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.714
REALLY WHAT THEIR SPECIFIC PLANS

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.349
ARE REMOVING HOW THEY'RE GOING

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:20.117
TO DO IT AND WHAT THE CHALLENGES

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.485
ARE.

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:22.553
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE CONCERNS

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.320
ABOUT AT LEAST TWO COUNTIES IT

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.789

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.857

THEY WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.932
WORST CASE NUYS TO OF THAT --

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.634
HAVEN'T TAKEN THE STEPS

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.103
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SYSTEM

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.539
WITH A THAT CERTIFIED IN TO THE

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.574
NEW VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS.

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.278
IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION CORRECT

THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN'T

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.418
REMEMBER IF THIS SOUNDS LIKE A

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:56.320
BIG DEAL.

IT IS THIS ENOUGH TIME JUST AS

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:07.531
WELL AS IT IS IT ENOUGH TIME FOR

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:10.734
THOSE TWO COUNTIES TO GET THERE.

00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:13.904
I THINK THERE'S A YOU KNOW

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.873
THERE'S ANY OTHER CHALLENGES

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.174
IMPLEMENTATION NO IT'S NOT LOS

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.676
ANGELES IS IT HAS BEEN MOVING

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.678

THAT TO THEIR ONE OF THE ONES

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.585
THAT HAD SUBMITTED A REQUEST FOR

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.453

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.054
I'M.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.423
IT'S I THINK YES A YEAR OUT --

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:33.090
THERE'S CHALLENGES IN ANY

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.024
PROCUREMENT AS I SAID.

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.759
I'M AND I THINK THAT ALLOWING IT

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.361
THEY WOULDN'T BE USING

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.062
DECERTIFIED EQUIPMENT MAY BE

00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:40.064
USING WE WOULD BE EXTENDING.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.000
OUR APPROVAL FOR USE FOR THOSE

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:45.870
CAN'T THE SPECIFIC COUNTY CITY.

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:48.305
WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PEACE?

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:48.973
WITH THE BACKDROP OF YEAH RIGHT.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:49.974
ALSO IT IF THERE'S CHALLENGES

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.608
AND I WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH

00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:53.477
THEM. TO TO AGAIN I DON'T BUY

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:54.612
THEIR ISSUES WITH THEIR PENS

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.780
POINTS ARE WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:57.548
REALLY.

00:41:57.615 --> 00:42:00.784
AM NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO TO MOVE

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.386
FORWARD.

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:03.888
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE IN

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.289
THAT SITUATION KNOWN RIGHT OR

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.056
ANY COUNTY [inaudible]

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.459
NOW.

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:12.329
DOESN'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW.

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:14.331
THE ISSUE IS TAKEN CARE OF WELL

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:15.966
IN ADVANCE TO GIVE TRUST TO THE

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:18.002
PUBLIC AND TO THE VOTE.

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.503
HI THIS IS GENERALLY NINETY

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.372
ELECT DIVISION A SECTOR STATE

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.940
OFFICE.

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:25.943
AND THESE ARE TOO SMALL COUNTY I

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.244
CAN REMEMBER THE NAMES I THERE.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.579
TWO SMALL CAN USE IT DIDN'T HAVE

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.213
THE FUNDING OF THE MONEY THAT

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.381
THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO PURCHASE

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:30.915
NEW SYSTEM.

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.750
SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GO A LONG

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.485
WAY IN ASSISTING THEM MONEY IN
