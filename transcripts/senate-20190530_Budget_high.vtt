AND THEREFORE.

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:08.561
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:10.763
LEGISLATURE THINK ABOUT THIS AS

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.765
SOMEWHAT OF A RARE OPPORTUNITY

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.801
TO CONTINUE PREPARING THE STATE

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.136
FOR THE FUTURE -- PREPARING THE

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.137
STATE TO ACCOMMODATE

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:20.006
UNANTICIPATED COSTS THAT CAN

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:21.574
ARISE.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.276
BOTH FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.645
BUT ALSO NATURAL DISASTERS OR

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:26.846
OTHER KIND OF EENTS.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.215
AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THERE

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.950
IS LIKELY TO BE ANOTHER

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.218
RECESSION IN THE FUTURE IT'S

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.520
DIFFICULT FOR ANYONE TO PREDICT

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:37.723
EXACTLY WHEN BUT NO MOST MOST

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.192
EVERYONE AGREES THAT THERE WILL

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:42.028
BE ANOTHER RECESSION SO.

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:44.597
WITH THAT LET ME TURN TO THE

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.032
FIRST PAGE AND HERE.

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:47.733
I WOULD ACTUALLY ECHO SENATOR

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.535
MITCHELL'S -- OPENING COMMENTS

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:50.837
IN THAT.

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.271
THIS SLIDE COMPARES THE GENERAL

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:54.407
FUND CONDITION UNDER THE THREE

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:57.109
DIFFERENT PLANS AND WHAT YOU

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:58.444
WOULD FIND WHAT WE WHAT THE YOU

00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.712
KNOW THE POINT I WOULD WANT TO

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.047
MAKE HERE IS JUST THAT.

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.515
LOOKING AT ALL THREE PLANS YOU

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.317
SEE VERY SIMILAR GENERAL FUND

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.352
CONDITION AT THAT THE HIGH LEVEL

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.220
AT LEAST.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.921
THIS REFLECTS THE ALL THREE

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.324
PLANS ADOPTED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.859
FINANCE REVENUE ESTIMATES.

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:14.560
AND ALL THREE PLANS HAVE ADOPTED

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.362
THE SAME LEVEL OF PROPOSITION

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:17.697
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND SO WITH

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:20.700
THOSE TWO VARIABLES IN SYNC.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.034
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT AT

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:26.739
LEAST AT A HIGH LEVEL THE BUDGET

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.907
CONDITION LOOKS VERY SIMILAR.

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:28.741
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:29.976
DIFFERENCES IN SOME OF THE

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.178
DIFFERENCES -- STEM FROM FAIRLY

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.580
SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHOICES THAT

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.749
DIFFER AMONG THE THREE DIFFERENT --

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:37.917
PLANS.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.919
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:41.153
REVENUES.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.622
THERE ARE HIGHER REVENUES.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.590
AND THEN THE OTHER THAN THE

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.992
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLANS AND

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:46.926
THAT.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.527
PRIMARILY REFLECTS THAT THE

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:50.229
GOVERNOR'S PLAN.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.398
ASSUMES SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.200
FROM THE ADOPTION OF TAX

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:55.968
CONFORMITY MEASURES CONFORMING

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.803
THE STATE TAX CODE WITH THE

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.672
FEDERAL TAX CODE.

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.207
AND THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:03.242
PLANS -- DO NOT MAKE THAT

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.278
ASSUMPTION UP FRONT.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.346
THE HOWEVER THE SENATE AND

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.748
ASSEMBLY PLANTS GENERATE A

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.549
SIMILAR LEVEL OF ADDITIONAL

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.251
GENERAL FUND CAPACITY MORE ON

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.420
THE EXPENDITURE SIDE BY ASSUMING

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:16.322
AN EXTENSION OF THE MANAGED CARE

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.357
ORGANIZATION TAX PACKAGE THEM CO

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.560
TAX THAT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.194
AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.496
YEAR.

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:24.096
AND THEN THE OTHER.

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:25.498
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON THIS

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:26.966
PAGE THAT I WOULD JUST TRY YOUR

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.434
ATTENTION TO IS THAT THE

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.337
ASSEMBLY ENDS WITH A NEARLY

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.171
THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.773
A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.475
UNCERTAINTIES RESERVE BALANCE --

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.312
WHICH IS MATERIALLY HIGHER THAN

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:42.381
THE OTHER TWO PLANS ON THE PAGE.

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.250
SO MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE I

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.017
THINK THAT KIND OF LEADS ME INTO

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:47.620
THE DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT TOTAL

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:50.122
COMPARING TOTAL RESERVE BALANCES.

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.024
AND THE WHEN YOU KNOW AGAIN I

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:53.993
THINK I CAN SAY THAT ALL THREE

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.429
PLANS HAVE FROM CANNABIS

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:57.930
HISTORIC STANDPOINT ALL THREE

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.532
PLAN SHOW VERY HIGH TOTAL

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.233
RESERVES AT THE END OF THE

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.134
BUDGET YEAR.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:06.505
SO THAT SAYS THERE'S IN BROAD

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.106
TERMS THERE'S AGREEMENT ABOUT

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:07.506
THAT.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.109
ALL THREE PLANS INCLUDE A SEVEN

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:11.744
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.280
INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:15.982
A WITH THE SENATE ACTUALLY

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.683
PUTTING AN ADDITIONAL SIX

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.551
HUNDRED MILLION INTO THE SAFETY

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:19.785
NET RESERVE WHICH BRINGS ITS

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.988
BALANCE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.823
TWO TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.257
ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS I WAS

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.493
JUST SAYING A MOMENT AGO THE SFE

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.462
YOU BALANCE IS NOTABLY HIGHER

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:30.963
THAN THE OTHER TWO PLANS A THREE

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.531
POINT SEVEN BILLION.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.799
THAT PROVIDES THE STATE WITH

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:34.934
SOME.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.202
YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL FISCAL

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:39.972
FLEXIBILITY TO CERTAINLY COVER --

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.175
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY BUT ALSO

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.710
BECAUSE IT'S A TO SERVE A

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.612
FLEXIBLE -- RESERVE OTHER TYPES

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.714
OF UNANTICIPATED COSTS THAT

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.349
COULD ARISE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.551
THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:53.853
JUST MENTION ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:56.055
RESERVES.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.091
IS THAT IT'S THE ONE FIGURE HERE

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.327
THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL RESERVE

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.562
BALANCE INTO THE LOWER END OF

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.298
THE RANGE OF TWENTY TO FORTY

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.466
BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT OUR

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:10.002
OFFICE HAS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED.

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.738
WOULD BE THE AMOUNT NECESSARY

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.207
FOR THE STATE TO WITHSTAND.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.476
THE FFECTS OF A A RECESSION THE

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:19.111
MILD OR MODERATE RECESSION

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:20.513
WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE SOME

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.214
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS LIKE TAX

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:24.750
INCREASES OR SPENDING REDUCTIONS

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.053
WERE -- YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.655
COST SHIFT MOOD MANEUVER.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.724
SO THE ASSEMBLY PLANT IS NOTABLE

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.626
FOR BRINGING TOTAL RESERVES INTO

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:36.195
THAT -- LEVEL THAT WE HAVE SAID

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:36.962
WOULD BE.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:41.267
HELPFUL AND IN THAT SCENARIO.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.601
MOVING.

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:46.872
TO THE NEXT PAGE -- SO -- FEAR

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.407
NOT I WON'T GO THROUGH THIS

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:50.609
ENTIRE SLIGHT IT'S A FULL SLIDE

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:51.944
COVERING.

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.346
A LOT OF A LETTER THE MAJOR

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.848
PROGRAMMATIC GENERAL FUND

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.584
SPENDING CONFERENCE ITEMS AND

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.052
THE THE REASON IT'S A FULL SITE

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:01.353
IS REALLY JUST BECAUSE WE WANTED

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.056
TO PROVIDE FOR YOU SORT OF A ALL

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.991
IN NE PLACE A SUMMARY OF SOME

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.828
OF THE MAJOR POLICY ITEMS THAT

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:09.962
YOU'LL BE CARRYING.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:11.597
IN CONFERENCE AND A BRIEF

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:12.298
DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:16.302
DIFFERENCES IN THE IN THE PLANS --

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.870
AND SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF A

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.205
REFERENCE FOR YOU.

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:20.940
HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO JUST

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:22.408
MENTION A COUPLE THERE ARE SOME

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:24.677
DIFFERENCES TO NOTE -- IN THE

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.245
STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AREA THE

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.013
SENATE INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.982
TEN MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING --

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.217
FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:33.652
PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS NOT IN

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.054
EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO PLANS.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:37.022
AND THE SENATE PLAN ALSO

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.592
INCLUDES -- FUNDING FOR THE

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.727
ACCESS TO JUSTICE PACKAGE AND

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:43.162
THE PRISON TO COMMUNITY PIPELINE

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:45.364
PACKAGE SO THOSE ARE DIFFERENCES

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.966
THAT YOU'LL BE ADDRESSING IN THE

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.367
IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.935
AND ALSO WE DON'T HAVE ON HERE

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.204
THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS --

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.539
AND PROPOSALS.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.940
MOSTLY BECAUSE THESE ARE.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.809
WHAT YOU EAT WHEN WE WENT

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.410
THROUGH THAT THERE'S A GENERAL

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.513
CONCEPTUALIZATION MEANT ABOUT

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:00.946
THOSE?

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:03.215
AND SO -- AND SOME OF THE

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.316
DETAILS WILL BE.

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:05.885
ALSO SORTED OUT IN CONFERENCE

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:07.520
COMMITTEE BUT THAT'S WHY THAT'S

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:10.556
NOT ON HERE AND I WANT TO GO AND

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.590
GET IT KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'LL BE

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:12.625
DEALING WITH THE SAFE AND

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.693
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ISSUE

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.129
WHICH HAS -- POTENTIALLY SOME

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.430
GENERAL FUND IMPLICATION.

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:19.932
WE DID NOT PUT THAT ON HERE

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:22.568
MOSTLY -- IN THE INTEREST OF A

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:26.372
THE LENGTH OF WHAT WE HAVE ON

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.175
THE TABLE.

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:30.109
AND THEN THE OTHER JUST

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.043
OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE IS THAT

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.844
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN.

00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:34.547
INCLUDES SOME FUNDING THAT WOULD

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.415
BE SCHEDULED UNDER HIS MULTI

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:39.285
YEAR PLAN TO SUNSET AFTER A

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.553
COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:43.022
THE THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY --

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.523
BOTH DO NOT INCLUDE THOSE

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.159
SUNSETS IN THEIR PLAN AND

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:50.229
BECAUSE THE FUNDING PERTAINS TO

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.897
PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.532
ONGOING IN NATURE.

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:56.001
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I HSS --

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:58.370
RATES.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.206
WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:01.840
TREATING THEM AS AN ON GOING

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.676
RECOGNIZING THE ONGOING COSTS

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.212
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PROGRAMS

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.814
IS IS MORE -- APPROPRIATE IN THE

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:13.185
IN THE MULTI YEAR PLAN.

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:17.323
SO THEN MOVING TO THE NEXT PAGE.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.525
HERE WE HAVE A SIDE BY SIDE

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:22.127
COMPARISON OF HOW OF THE THREE

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:22.795
PLANS [inaudible]

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:24.697
ROACH.

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:26.332
MAKING SUPPLEMENTAL DEBT AND

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:28.234
LIABILITY PAYMENTS IN THE BUDGET

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.201
YEAR.

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.536
AND AGAIN ALL THREE PLANS

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.838
ALLOCATE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:34.039
TO PAYING DOWN DEBT AND WHY IT

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:37.876
THE STATE'S DEAD IN LIABILITIES --

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:40.546
THING -- IT YOU KNOW I CAN YOU

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.114
CAN SEE THIS PEARL OF DRY YOUR

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.616
ATTENTION TO SOME KEY

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:44.283
DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.150
PLANS.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:46.218
FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.620
ACTUALLY PAYS DOWN MORE DEBT

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.021
THAN THE OTHER TWO PLANS

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.257
PRIMARILY BECAUSE UNDER HIS PLAN

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.525
HE MAKES A UP FRONT THREE THREE

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:54.860
BILLION DOLLAR.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.362
SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.130
STATE'S CALPERS UNFUNDED

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.498
LIABILITY.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:04.270
AND THE GOVERNOR ALSO INCLUDES

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.105
ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION.

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.173
FOR I'M DOING -- CERTAIN BUDGET.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.942
DEFERRALS THAT THE STATE IS

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:12.177
CONTENT HELD HIS STILL CARRYING

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:12.878
THAT ARE KIND OF A HOLD OVER

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.213
FROM THE WRIST.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.681
THE LAST RECESSION.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:17.082
THE SENATE DIFFERS FROM THE

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.350
GOVERNOR'S PLAN IN THAT ON AT

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.219
LEAST UP FRONT IT INCLUDES --

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:22.221
SMALLER ONE POINT ONE BILLION

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.322
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:25.190
CALPERS.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.759
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.961
AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE WOULD

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.963
BE -- THERE IS A KIND OF A PLACE

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.132
HOLDER FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:34.400
THE FUTURE.

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:38.737
IF IF -- TAX CONFORMITY REVENUES

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:39.338
BECOME AVAILABLE LATER IN THE

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.105
YEAR.

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:42.074
ARE THE ASSEMBLY DIFFERS IN THAT

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.744
IT PUTS A ONE POINT TWO BILLION

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:48.380
DOLLAR -- CONTRIBUTION TO THE

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:51.450
CALPERS CAL CALPERS.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.951
LIABILITY BUT IT'S THE CALPERS

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.153
LIABILITY OF THE SCHOOL

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:56.088
DISTRICTS ON BEHALF OF THAT ARE

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.456
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:59.858
NOW ONE THING ON THE PREVIOUS

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:01.593
PAGE THAT I SHOULD ALSO POINT

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.961
OUT IS JUST THAT.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.731
THERE IS ALL THREE PLANS INCLUDE

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.566
MAKING A THE PENSION

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.069
CONTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF SCHOOL

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.804
DISTRICTS FOR TEACHERS THE

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.205
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PLAN WOULD

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.274
MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS IN ADDITION

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.775
TO THAT ON BEHALF OF THEIR

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:20.112
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. TO CALPERS.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.548
NOW -- THE KEY THING ABOUT THESE

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:24.550
CONTRIBUTIONS IS THAT THEY

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.719
SUPPLANT WHERE THEY ARE IN

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.854
DESIGNED TO BE IN PLACE OF THE

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.589
DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE THE

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:31.790
CONTRIBUTIONS THE DISTRICTS

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:33.192
WOULD OTHERWISE BE MAKING ON

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.193
THEIR OWN SO IT DOESN'T

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.662
REPRESENT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.197
TO THE PENSION SYSTEMS.

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:39.698
AND IT DOES NOT.

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:40.999
REALLY ALTER THE LONG TERM

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:43.202
TRAJECTORY OF THOSE LIABILITIES

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:44.303
BUT IT DOES PROVIDE SOME

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.539
TEMPORARY TEMPORARY RELIEF TO TO

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:48.841
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- FOR TWO

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.643
YEARS IN THAT AREA SO IF YOU

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.045
LOOK AT THE ASSEMBLY CUT BACK ON

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:54.913
THE DECK PAGE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.085
ASSEMBLY I HAVE ONE POINT. ONE

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:01.720
FIVE BILLION FOR THE CALPERS

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:02.020
[inaudible]

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:02.654
YOU KNOW.

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:03.288
CONTRIBUTION BUT THAT'S BECAUSE

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:04.189
THIS IS ADDRESSING THE LONG TERM

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.992
LIABILITY NOT JUST -- US A

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.094
PLANTATION OF THE NEXT TWO YEAR

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.797
CONTRIBUTIONS -- PARTIAL SO

00:17:11.864 --> 00:17:14.199
PLANTATION I SHOULD SAY.

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.502
SO THEN THE OTHER FINAL POINT

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:17.970
I'LL MAKE ON THISSLIDE IS JUST

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.338
YOU'LL NOTE THAT NEITHER THE

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.240
SENATE NOR THE ASSEMBLY PLANS

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.575
INCLUDE FUNDS THAT.

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:25.778
ARE ALLOCATED FOR UNDOING SOME

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.446
OF THE BUDGET LIABILITIES THAT

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:28.947
THE GOVERNOR INCLUDES THE ONE

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:30.416
POINT SEVEN BILLION.

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:32.418
AND WE THINK THIS IS REASONABLE

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.486
BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE IDEAS

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.255
BEHIND ON DOING THE DEFERRALS IS

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:37.623
THAT THOSE ARE ACTIONS THAT THE

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:38.891
STATE COULD TAKE AGAIN IF IT

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:41.326
ENCOUNTERS FISCAL STRESS IN THE

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.227
FUTURE.

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:44.696
WE JUST THINK -- OUR OFFICE HAS

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:46.532
BEEN ON RECORD THAT YOU KNOW

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.767
THOSE RESOURCES PROBABLY WOULD

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:50.803
BE BETTER ALLOCATED TO BUILDING

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.440
HIGHER RESERVES OR ALTERNATIVELY

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:55.474
PAIN DOWN.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.845
LONGER TERM DEBT WITH KIND OF

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:00.312
MORE.

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:00.946
WE JUST THINK THERE'S A BETTER

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.281
RETURN ON PAIN DOWN LONGER TERM

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:05.417
DEBT AND DIRECTING THOSE FUNDS

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.085
TO UNDOING THE DEFERRALS.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.688
BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:14.493
THERE -- SO THAT TAKES US HERE

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.061
TO THE TO THE FINAL.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:18.063
PAGE IN THIS SLIDE DECK.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.499
THEN AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO STEP

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.301
BACK AND POINT OUT THE YOU KNOW

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:24.770
AT THIS MOMENT THE STATE HAS A

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:25.971
VERY LARGE ROUTE.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.407
BUDGETARY SURPLUS HEALTHY

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.843
RESERVES AND BUT IT'S NOT LIKELY

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:32.611
TO BE A SITUATION THAT WILL

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:35.214
PERSIST ON A RECURRING BASIS.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.949
AND SO ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:39.051
IS THAT THE BEST WAY FOR THE

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:42.855
STATE -- TO AIR FOR THE FUTURE

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:45.157
IS TO BUILD LARGER RESERVES NOW

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:45.757
THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:47.860
RECOMMENDED IN THAT AREA WE

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:49.761
THINK THE ASSEMBLY -- GOES THE

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.464
FURTHEST AND THEN WE ALSO THINK

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.600
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING --

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.401
SUPPLEMENTAL DEBT PAYMENTS.

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:59.872
THE TARGETING THOSE MORE TOWARD --

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:03.075
DEBTS THAT WOULD HAVE A TWO MORE

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:04.810
DAYS PREPARE THE STATE FOR THE

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:05.978
FUTURE PROBABLY.

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:09.014
A BETTER USE OF THOSE RESOURCES.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:12.184
AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE WHEN I

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.519
THINK ABOUT THE POSITION THAT

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:18.023
THE STATE IS AND IT IS.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.291
KIND OF ONE ONE WAY TO SAY IT IS

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.526
THAT.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.828
D. ACTIONS THAT THE STATE TAKES

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.897
NOW WITH THIS HEALTHY SURPLUS

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:27.165
WILL IN MANY WAYS TO FIND ITS

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.567
EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE NEXT

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:30.035
DOWNTURN.

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.770
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.139
LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES AVOIDING

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.708
HAVING TO MAKE AS MANY DIFFICULT

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.143
DECISIONS IN THE NEXT DOWNTURN.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.712
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE STRONG A

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:43.048
SURPLUS POSITION NOW TO SET

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:45.017
ASIDE SOME OF THAT FOR RESERVES

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:45.851
WOULD LESSEN THAT.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.920
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THIS

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:49.888
IS A POLICY CHOICE AND TO THE

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.323
EXTENT THE MEMBERS.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.659
WOULD PREFER TO BE IN A POSITION

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:54.960
WHERE YOU.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.795
BE WILLING TO MAKE MORE --

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.698
POLICY CHANGES TO RESPOND TO A

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.199
RECESSIONARY SITUATION.

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:01.800
YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.101
TRADE OFF.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.470
AND SO ARE OUR RECOMMENDATION OF

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.973
COURSE IS TO DO THE RESERVES A

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.209
LITTLE BIT HIGHER AND AND TO PAY

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:13.779
DOWN MORE OF THE LONG TERM DEBTS.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.748
SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

00:20:16.815 --> 00:20:18.050
ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.384
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.253
QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.522
YOUR FROM FINANCE CENTER MORLOCK.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:25.190
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:27.392
WELCOME.

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:28.727
THANK YOU SENATOR WE HAVE

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.862
CROSSED PATHS BEFORE.

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.531
THAT'S RIGHT IT'S GOOD TO SEE

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:34.800
YOU IN THIS POSITION.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.435
I KNOW THAT TERM.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.370
SOME LONG STANDING INSTITUTIONAL

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:42.407
POLICIES DON'T DIE EASILY.

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:43.942
BUT I'M WONDERING COULD WE STOP

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.410
PUTTING PARENTHESES AROUND

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:47.079
SUBTITLES.

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.680
BRING TO A FINAL STOP DOING THAT

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.816
THIS.

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:54.052
THE CPA JUST GONE NUTS.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.621
I AM.

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:59.825
I HAVE TO SAY IT SENATORS.

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:00.258
ARE LAUGHING YEAH.

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:01.193
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:01.960
REALIZED THAT IT WAS ONE

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:05.063
QUESTION THAT I COULD PROBABLY

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:09.468
PREPARE MYSELF FOR FROM

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:09.768
[inaudible]

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:12.104
BUT WE HAVE A WORKING GROUP

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.939
THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO LOOK

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.274
AT THAT ISSUE.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.572
THE FOR SAME QUESTION FINANCE

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:59.110
WHEN THEY COME UP SENATOR NELSON

00:27:59.177 --> 00:27:59.411
[inaudible]

00:27:59.477 --> 00:28:02.981
STATE CONTEXT -- MORLOCK TALKED

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:03.915
BRIEFLY ABOUT THE LOCAL

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.950
EXPERIENCE AND NOW THAT

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:08.286
TRANSLATES TO WHAT WE DO HERE.

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:12.724
BUT A FEW YEARS AGO WE ADAM.

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.459
BIG SURPLUS TO NOT AS GREAT AS

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.361
THIS.

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:19.564
ONE THE GOT SPENT.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.699
SPENT IN THE COMBINATION OF NEW

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:24.502
PROGRAMS BASED BUILDING.

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:28.540
AND EVEN SOME TAX DECREASES

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:28.840
[inaudible]

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:31.643
AND THEY DID NOT.

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:32.944
PROVED TO BE A FORMULA FOR THE

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:34.979
FUTURE.

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.381
THIS VERY QUICKLY.

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.483
THE ECONOMY SOFTENED.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.351
I THINK WE STARTED WHEN I CAME

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:43.755
BACK IN OLD AGE WE WERE. FIFTEEN

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.490
BILLION IN THE RED. ONE UP TO

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:48.159
TWENTY FIVE BILLION.

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:48.793
SHOWS HOW QUICKLY THAT CAN COME

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.995
AROUND.

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:55.200
AND WE ARE VERY DEPENDENT.

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:57.836
TO ON THE WEALTH OF THE TECH.

00:28:57.902 --> 00:29:02.507
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.341
I AM NOT A COMMUNIST AND I DON'T

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:05.577
SPEAK WITH ANY PARTICULAR DATA

00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:07.779
BUT I'M FEARFUL THAT THAT'S

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:10.081
GOING TO SOFTEN AS WELL

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:10.381
[inaudible]

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:11.950
AND SO.

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:13.852
WHAT I HAVE SUGGESTED AS TO THIS

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.087
BUDGET?

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.122
THE WE CONTINUE TO BE

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:17.422
[inaudible]

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.791
PRUDENT.

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:22.293
PRUDENT IN TERMS OF LONG TERM

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.596
BASE BUILDING [inaudible]

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.998
OBLIGATIONS.

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:28.333
I BELIEVE YOU'RE CAUTIONING US

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:31.169
IN THE SAME MANNER.

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:34.205
AM I CORRECT IN THAT.

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.440
YEAH IS IT BUT I THINK THAT SAYS

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.977
SOMETHING WE DO AGREE WITH YES.

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.945
ANOTHER SUBTLE THING.

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:42.814
AND AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE DATA

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.150
BILL BY BILL.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:49.087
BUT I DO READ A LOT OF THE BILLS.

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.956
AND OVER RECENT YEARS.

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.558
PARTICULAR LAST TWO YEARS IT

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.626
SEEMS TO BECOME MORE OF A HABIT

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:57.295
HERE.

00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:00.031
OF PUTTING IN A GIVEN SPENDING

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:04.002
BILL FOR A CERTAIN IDEA.

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:06.638
SUBJECT TO FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS.

00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:08.907
OF THE LEGISLATURE.

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.242
NOW THAT ISN'T.

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.344
NECESSARILY OF BINDING THING ONE

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:16.381
LEGISLATURE CAN'T BIND A FUTURE.

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:18.082
ONE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.651
BUILDING.

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:23.354
PROGRAMS BASED ON FUTURE

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:25.623
EXPENDITURES.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.792
VOTE BY FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:30.061
WHAT THAT DOES IS PUT PRESSURE

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.664
ON THOSE FUTURE LEGISLATORS TO

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.365
EMBRACE THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.800
THERE IF YOU WILL WAITING IN THE

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:38.803
WINGS.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.171
THAT IS NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION.

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:42.340
BUT AS AN OBSERVATION OF

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:44.342
SOMETHING THAT WOULD WAX FOR

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:47.412
QUESTION HERE MMHM MMHM.

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:50.348
YOU SIR MISTER MCCARTY

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:50.648
[inaudible]

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:52.750
THANK YOU.

00:30:52.817 --> 00:30:53.685
THIS I THINK WILL BE ADDRESSED

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.153
IN OUR EDUCATION PIECE IN A

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.488
LITTLE BIT BUT I CONCUR THAT.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.457
SCHOOLS ARE STRAPPED IN BUT

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:00.992
CENTER MORE LIKE SAID.

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.493
ANYMORE WE COULD PUT INTO THAT

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.996
CAL STIRS OUR CALPERS PAYMENTS

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:05.597
ARE DISTRICTS CERTAINLY HELPS

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.966
THEM WITH THEIR ONGOING.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.835
EXPENDITURES AND THE REALITY

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:13.137
THAT EVEN THE WORST SPENDING

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.205
CHáVEZ MODELS.

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.273
THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STILL

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.207
STRAPPED RIGHT HERE IN

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.175
SACRAMENTO LA IN OAKLAND.

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:20.111
SO AS WHEN I GO BACK TO WHAT YOU

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:21.613
SAID AT THE LA ON THE YOU SAID

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:24.315
THE MAYBE YOU PREFER THAT WE

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:24.949
HAVE A HIGHER [inaudible]

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.584
RESERVE AMOUNTS.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.454
THAT SAID ACCURATE.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.623
IF THAT'S THE CASE IT WILL YEAH

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:33.591
HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO THAT.

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:36.094
WELL MOSTLY I THINK.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.198
WHAT WE ARE -- OUR POINT IS THAT

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.600
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD --

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.302
SHOULD CONSIDER ADOPTING A

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.671
HIGHER LEVEL OF OVERALL RESERVES

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.306
THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED.

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.475
AND ACTUALLY BOTH THE SENATE AND

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:52.443
THE ASSEMBLY PLANS ARE HIGHER

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.346
THE ASSEMBLY BY A SOMEWHAT MORE

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:57.415
THAN THAN THE SENATE BUT SO.

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.851
I MEAN.

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.686
WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY --

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.589
SPELLING OUT A DEFINITIVE -- A

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:05.890
PRECISE NUMBER I THINK IT'S A

00:32:05.957 --> 00:32:07.625
IT'S A DIFFICULT TO SETTLE ON

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:08.860
WHAT THE EXACT.

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:11.362
RIGHT LEVEL SHOULD BE BUT WE

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:13.998
THINK THAT THE HIGHER LEVELS

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:15.767
INCLUDED IN BOTH THE SENATE AND

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:18.036
ASSEMBLY PLANTS IN PARTICULAR

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.837
ASSEMBLY PLANTS.

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:22.640
ARE GETTING INTO THE RANGE THAT

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:26.778
WE THINK IS PRUDENT.

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:29.113
OKAY AND THEN AGAIN WHAT WE'RE

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.548
GONNA GET TO EDUCATION A BET.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.550
BUT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS JANUARY

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:33.051
BUDGET.

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:34.719
THAT PUT INTO TO BUY DOWN SOME

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.488
THAT RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.891
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND BOTH HOUSES

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.693
WHAT A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:42.694
I SIMPLY THINK THAT SUCH A

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.896
PRUDENT APPROACH AND AND DO YOU

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:45.530
THINK IS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.498
DO.

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:48.499
EVEN MORE KNOWING THAT.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.767
IS SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP OUR

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.336
STRAPS SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:53.271
ABSENCE OF INCREASED LCF THAT

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.206
PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY.

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:57.108
YES WE DO THINK IT'S HELPFUL --

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:59.310
IN PARTICULAR WE THINK THE

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.579
SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:04.182
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WILL

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:08.286
HAVE A SORT OF A LONGER TERM

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:10.321
BENEFIT -- SO THERE'S SORT OF A

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:12.590
TRADE OFF IF YOU PUT IF YOU MAKE.

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:14.792
A LARGER CONTRIBUTION THAN IS

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.828
REQUIRED TO THE PENSION SYSTEMS

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:20.998
NOW. FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:24.035
YOU HAVE A AN ABILITY.

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:26.671
TO INCREMENTALLY LOWER THE

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.973
ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.742
BE NECESSARY GOING FORWARD.

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.176
IN A ANOTHER THING THAT THE

00:33:32.243 --> 00:33:35.113
STATE CAN DO IS SIMPLY GIVE

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.415
MONEY UP FRONT TO PAY.

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.750
A PORTION OF THE PENSION

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:41.252
CONTRIBUTIONS IN A SPECIFIC YEAR

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.421
NOT ADDING TO WHAT IS OTHERWISE

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.056
PAID BUT JUST PAIN PART OF THE

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:47.158
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS ON THEIR

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:47.625
BEHALF.

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.961
AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO INCLUDED

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:51.896
IN ALL THREE PLANS.

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.531
AND IT DOES PROVIDE.

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:56.167
SIGNIFICANT FISCAL RELIEF FOR

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:57.802
THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.971
WE WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:00.905
YOU KNOW.

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:02.540
OUR POINT IS JUST THAT THAT IS A

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.842
FORM OF TEMPORARY FISCAL RELIEF

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.577
IN IN THAT AREA.

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.212
VERSUS THE OTHER BUT IT'S LARGER

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.548
IT'S LARGER UP FRONT TEMPORARY

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:12.150
FISCAL RELIEF THEN THE THE OTHER

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.551
OPTION OF PUTTING.

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.486
A LARGE CONTRIBUTION INTO THE

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:18.222
UNFUNDED LIABILITY INTO THE

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:21.292
SYSTEM YES I I HEAR POINTS

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.727
ACTUALLY IS LIKE.

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:23.261
PAYING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:23.928
PAYMENT FOR A FEW MONTHS VERSUS

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.430
BUYING DOWN THE PRINCIPLE OF

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:26.798
THEIR LOAN THAT'S THE ANALOGY I

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.766
USED WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:31.235
OTHER DAY OKAY THERE YOU GO.

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:33.037
SO AT IT ONCE MAYOR NOT BE MORE

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:34.172
RESPONSIBLE THAN THE OTHERS ARE

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:37.375
YOU RECOMMENDING A COMBINATION

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.343
OF THOSE OR HURT.

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:40.678
UNDER THE LOWER JUST WERE A CAST

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:43.481
THE THING WERE WERE RECOMMENDED

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.750
TO POINT OUT IS THAT.

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:46.551
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FISCAL

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:47.118
PRESSURES THAT MANY SCHOOL

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:48.920
DISTRICTS ARE UNDER RIGHT NOW

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.788
THEY'RE ACTUALLY AT A LEVEL

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:51.556
WHERE.

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:52.857
IN A NON RECESSIONARY

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.792
ENVIRONMENT THE PROPOSITION

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.861
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVEL IS.

00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:00.164
IS -- HI AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.532
PROVIDING THEM FISCAL RIVER YOU

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.700
KNOW THE THESE PLANS WOULD

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.136
PROVIDE FISCAL RELIEF AT A TIME

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.338
WHEN.

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:08.473
YOU KNOW THE THE REVENUES ARE

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:10.908
ARGUABLY AT A AT A HIGHER POINT.

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:14.812
AND SO IN THE FUTURE -- IN A IN

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:15.580
A WEAKER CLIMATE [inaudible]

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:18.583
YOU KNOW. ONE IDEA THAT WE HAD

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.084
EARLIER IN THE YEAR WAS THAT YOU

00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:23.254
COULD -- SET ASIDE THESE FUNDS.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.356
TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF TO THE

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:26.958
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.726
SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR A TIME WHEN

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:31.162
THE BROADER STATE BUDGET IS IN A

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:34.665
MORE STRESSED SITUATION.

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.534
OF COURSE THE THE AND FOR YOU

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:37.768
KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WITH THAT

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:38.903
YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING FISCAL

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.105
RELIEF -- RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:42.573
THERE'S SOME DISTRICTS AS PEOPLE

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.708
HAVE MENTIONED THAT ARE.

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:45.643
THAT ARE -- ALREADY IN FISCAL

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.044
PRESSURE SO I MEAN I THINK WE

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:48.713
REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS YOU KNOW

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.381
KIND OF AT A CERTAIN POINT IT

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:52.216
BECOMES A CHOICE -- ON PART OF

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:53.651
THE LEGISLATURE WHICH HOW YOU

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:56.120
WANT TO PROCEED WITH THIS

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:57.321
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE EVEN WITH A

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.390
LARGE SURPLUS THE RESOURCES ARE

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:00.725
FINITE AND YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE OF

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:03.961
ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THEM SO

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:04.262
[inaudible]

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:05.663
THANK YOU.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.864
THANK YOU MANAGER YOU'RE VERY

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.132
WELCOME SIR [inaudible]

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.668
MR OBERNOLTE.

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.402
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT'S AN

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:12.970
HONOR TO BE SERVING WITH YOU

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.405
ONCE AGAIN ON THE CONFERENCE

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.606
COMMITTEE.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.542
I JUST WANT TO CHIME IN HERE

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.310
BECAUSE I THOUGHT OF THE ANALOGY

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:20.778
OF MAKING SOMEONE'S MORTGAGE

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.580
PAYMENT FOR THEM IS AN

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:25.249
INTERESTING AN APT ONE BUT JUST

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.517
LIKE THAT ANALOGY.

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:27.852
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.353
AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO PRINCIPLE

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.154
IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.522
INTEREST AND THE FACT OF THE

00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:32.557
MATTER IS WHEN WE MAKE A

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:34.058
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE LONG

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:36.294
TERM PERSON STIRS LIABILITIES.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.329
FOR PAYING DOWN A LOT MORE OF

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.031
FUTURE PAYMENTS THEN WE ARE IF

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:42.366
WE JUST ALLOW THEM. TO HELP US

00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:44.001
MAKE THE PAYMENT THIS YEAR

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:46.437
INSTEAD OF THEM SO -- HI.

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:49.240
IF I GOT MY WAY IT WOULD ALL BE

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:50.174
A LIEU GOING TOWARDS LONG TERM

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.242
LIABILITIES BECAUSE I THINK

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.977
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAXIMIZE

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.278
THE IMPACT OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.581
WE'RE INVESTING.

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:59.283
THAT WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THAT.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.885
YEAH A AGREE WITH THE

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.987
MATHEMATICS THAT YOUR SKETCHING

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.723
OUT THE THE THE TRADE OFF IS

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.392
THAT IT'S OVER THE LONGER TERM

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:09.694
YEAR AFTER YEAR IT'S GONNA IT

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.662
WILL REPRESENT A LESS NOTICEABLE

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.364
DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ANNUAL

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:14.599
CONTRIBUTION THEN.

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.900
YOU KNOW IT'S VERY NOTICEABLE

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.802
WHEN THE CONTRIBUTION RATES

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:20.771
DECLINED TO SIXTEENTH FROM 18%

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:25.376
216% BY -- PROVIDING THIS --

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.545
JULES SO PLANTATION IN THESE TWO

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.180
YEARS SO.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:30.748
A I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:33.651
DIFFERENCE SIR I AGREE WITH YOU.

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:34.518
HOWEVER I THINK WE KIND OF

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.886
KICKED THE CAN BIND DOWN THE

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.188
ROAD IF WE MAKE THE PAYMENTS

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.322
THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE'RE JUST

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.423
GOING TO MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.658
DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO THOSE

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.626
HIGHER PAYMENTS.

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:42.660
NEXT YEAR BECAUSE NO ONE

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:44.462
PRETENDS THAT THE RATE AT THE

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.731
THE PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO GO

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.366
DOWN ANY TIME SOON.

00:37:48.432 --> 00:37:49.567
YEAH I MEAN THESE ARE THIS IS

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.135
THESE ARE THE TRADE OFFS THAT

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.503
WE'VE TRIED TO SKETCH OUT AND I

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.006
I JUST THINK THAT.

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:58.376
pKNOW ONCE WE'VE PUT THEM BEFORE

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:01.646
YOU THEN IT'LL BE A DECISION OF

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.013
THE LEGISLATURE.

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:02.680
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:06.017
THANK YOU.

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:09.754
WE WANT TO FINANCE.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.123
FINANCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:12.823
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.225
COVERED A NUMBER OF THE KEY

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.027
DIFFERENCES SO I JUST WANT TO

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:18.629
MAKE THREE GENERAL POINTS ABOUT

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:19.997
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.999
THE FIRST IS A POINT THAT I KNOW

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:24.035
WE ALL APPRECIATE IS THE FACT

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:25.970
THAT WE ARE -- CREATING THIS

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:27.872
BUDGET IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF A

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:29.407
HEALTHY SURPLUS BUT ALSO GROWING

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.675
RISKS.

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.243
AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:34.178
TRADE WAR WITH CHINA WHICH IS ON

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:34.812
GOING FROM THE FEDERAL

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.580
GOVERNMENT WE TALKED ABOUT THE

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.149
FACT THAT WERE TEN YEARS INTO AN

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:39.817
ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHICH WILL BE

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.085
THIS SUMMER.

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.120
THE LONGEST SINCE WORLD WAR TWO

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:44.221
AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.556
ENVIRONMENT OF SLOWING GLOBAL

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:48.159
GROWTH AND IN ADDITION TO THAT

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.427
IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:52.063
HAS SENATOR MORE WALK MENTIONED --

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:52.830
WE'VE SEEN AN INVERSION OF THE

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.532
YIELD CURVE IN WHICH RATES ON

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:56.033
THE TEN YEAR TREASURY NOTE OR

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.035
ACTUALLY LOWER THAN RATES ARE ON

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.537
A ONE MONTH TREASURY NOTE

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:00.438
MEANING THAT.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.406
INVESTORS ARE DEMANDING LAST ON

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:03.874
AN ANALYZED BASIS TO LOCK UP

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:05.576
THEIR MONEY FOR TEN YEARS AND

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.078
THEY ARE FOR ONE MONTH BECAUSE

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:07.845
THEY ARE.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.480
PROJECTING THAT RATES WILL BE

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:12.149
LOWER IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:12.817
FEDERAL RESERVE MAY HAVE TO CUT

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:13.617
THEM.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:14.785
IN A RECESSION SO THESE ARE

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:16.020
THINGS THAT WE'RE ALL PAYING

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.755
VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AT

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.156
FINANCE AND I KNOW TO ROUTE

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.491
STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.026
THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:24.061
I WAS REMINDED OF AN OLD SAYING

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:25.563
BY JAMES CARVILLE WHO WAS.

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.363
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.532
CAMPAIGN MANAGER IN NINETEEN

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.133
NINETY TWO AND WORKING IN THE

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.568
WHITE HOUSE HE SAID AFTER THAT

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:31.969
HE SAID YOU KNOW I ALWAYS

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:32.770
THOUGHT IF THERE WERE

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:33.738
REINCARNATION.

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.372
I'D WANT TO COME BACK AS THE

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:36.674
PRESIDENT OR MAYBE A BATTING

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.275
AVERAGE OF FOUR HUNDRED HALL OF

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:39.510
FAMER IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES BUT

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:40.311
HE SAID.

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.712
NOW SEEING THIS I WANT TO COME

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.114
BACK AS THE BOND MARKET BECAUSE

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:48.219
THAT'S HOW YOU REALLY INTIMIDATE

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:48.953
EVERYBODY.

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:49.920
SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:51.789
THAT WE WANT TO WATCH VERY

00:39:51.856 --> 00:39:52.556
CLOSELY WE'RE NOT -- PROJECTING

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:53.591
A RECESSION BUT WE ARE PLANNING

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.625
FOR IT.

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.960
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:57.628
IS AS A RESULT OF THAT THE

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:58.696
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING A

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.498
BUDGET RESILIENCY AND I KNOW WE

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.232
ARE HAVINGAN IMPORTANT

00:40:01.298 --> 00:40:02.600
DISCUSSION TODAY AND OVER THE

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:03.901
NEXT COUPLE DAYS.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.337
ABOUT RESERVES -- BUT I ALSO

00:40:06.403 --> 00:40:07.104
WANT TO MAKE A RECORD THE

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.706
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.541
WE WANT TO BUILD RESERVES WE

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:11.842
WANT TO PAY DOWN UNFUNDED

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.211
LIABILITIES AND WE WANT TO GET

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:16.213
RID OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.615
CAME UP OVER THE FROM THE LAST

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.550
RECESSION THAT WE ARE STILL

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:19.950
DIGGING OUR WAY.

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:21.318
OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.554
MAINTAINS A VERY FIRM POSITION

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.122
ON FINALLY PAYING DOWN THAT WALL

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.758
TAX WHICH AT ONE POINT WAS OVER

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:29.160
THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS AND THE

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:30.828
DEBTS AND DEFERRALS -- THAT WERE

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:32.797
BEING DISCUSSED ARE PART OF THAT

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.564
SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:35.466
ADMINISTRATION COMMITMENT WE

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.768
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT A

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.370
REQUISITE AMOUNT NOT JUST INTO

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:40.437
RESERVES BUT INTO PAYING DOWN

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:42.206
OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES BECAUSE

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.641
THOSE PAYMENTS NOT ONLY HELP US

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:44.809
NEXT YEAR.

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:47.711
BUT IN THE YEAR AFTER THAT AFTER

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:48.879
THAT AND AFTER THAT.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.114
AND MOST OF ALL WE WANT TO PUT A

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.282
REAL EMPHASIS ON STRUCTURAL

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:53.951
BALANCE NOT ONLY -- IN ACTING A

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:55.619
BALANCED BUDGET THIS YEAR BUT

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.888
ALSO LOOKING OVER THE NEXT THREE

00:40:57.955 --> 00:40:59.023
YEARS AFTER DAYS IN OUR MULTI

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.724
YEAR FORECAST MAKING SURE THAT

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.393
WE ARE MATCHING ON GOING

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:02.993
SPENDING.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.495
WITH ONGOING REVENUES IN MAKING

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:05.696
SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPERATING

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.598
SURPLUS IN EVERY YEAR BECAUSE AS

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.633
ALL OF US KNOW IF WE END UP

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.402
OVERSHOOTING THE MARK AND HAVING

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.336
MORE RESERVES AT THE END OF A

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:13.904
GIVEN YEAR OVER THAT MULTI YEAR

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:14.438
PERIOD.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.740
DAN WE EXPECTED WE CAN ALWAYS

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:18.209
SPEND THAT MONEY AT THAT TIME

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.177
BUT IF WE END UP HAVING LESS

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:21.779
MONEY AND GO INTO AN OPERATING

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:22.646
TO DEFICIT.

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:23.581
THEN WE'LL BE BACK AT THE TABLE

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.482
FIGURING OUT WHICH EXPANSIONS

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.851
WILL HAVE TO ROLL BACK.

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:27.952
AND SO ALONG WITH THAT WERE

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.987
HOPING THAT ALL MAJOR -- FISCAL

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.422
ISSUES THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.357
THIS YEAR WILL BE CONSIDERED AS

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:35.292
PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND I

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.327
KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.162
DISCUSSION AROUND SUNSETS AND

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.330
THAT HAS TO DO WITH MAKING SURE

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.564
THAT WERE BALANCED AND OUT YEARS

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.432
AS WELL.

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:42.533
AND HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.904
PART OF THIS PROCESS AS WELL.

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:47.538
AND THEN THE LAST THING I WANT

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.606
TO MENTION VERY BRIEFLY -- WE

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:49.340
WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT BUT

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.976
THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE USED --

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.711
RELIED ON DEAL LESS REVENUES --

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:54.778
TO PUT TOGETHER THEIR BUDGETS

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:56.213
AND WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.148
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON AND

00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:00.050
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.452
TAKES PLACE WE KNOW THAT IN A

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:02.753
DEMOCRACY PUTTING TOGETHER A

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.955
BUDGET IS A POLITICAL PROCESS AS

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:05.856
IT SHOULD BE.

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.258
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REVENUES IN

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:09.326
PROJECTIONS OTHER PROFESSIONALS

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.060
AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TAKE

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.996
THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND THOSE

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:12.897
ARE COMPLETED BEFORE THE

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.732
GOVERNOR MAKES ANY MAJOR

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.100
DECISIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET.

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.168
SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT WE DO

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.170
BELIEVE IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:21.071
THE NUMBERS WORK AND ACHIEVE

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:23.474
STRUCTURAL BALANCE OVER THE LONG

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:23.941
TERM.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.076
WE DO RELY ON A TAX CONFORMITY

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.912
PACKAGE TO RAISE REVENUES TO PAY

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.813
FOR EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.582
CREDIT WE DO THINK THERE ARE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:33.083
SOME ISSUES -- IF THE

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.020
LEGISLATURE CHOOSES NOT TO ADOPT

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:38.722
THAT TAX CONFORMITY PACKAGE BUT

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.090
TO FUND THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.225
EIGHT GUARANTEE AT THE LEVEL THE

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:42.826
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.061
I'M SO HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SOME

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.996
OF THOSE DETAILS BUT WE BELIEVE

00:42:46.063 --> 00:42:47.464
THAT INCLUDING THE TAX CUT FROM

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.732
THE PACKAGE WHAT THE HIGHER

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:49.967
REVENUES THAT RESULTS AND

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.936
INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:53.637
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE.

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.706
IS THE BEST WAY TO GO HERE WE

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:58.008
ALSO BELIEVE THAT AN MCO TAX --

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.310
BECAUSE THOSE REVENUES ARE NOT

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.844
CERTAIN AND RELY ON APPROVAL

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.313
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.013
WANT TO WORK WITH THE

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.281
LEGISLATURE ON THE BEST PATH

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.849
FORWARD BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:06.884
THAT THOSE REVENUES.

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.185
SHOULD BE ALLOCATED AS PART OF

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.787
THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE AS

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:12.056
PART OF THIS PROCESS WE DO WANT

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:12.656
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REVENUE

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.224
THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.059
GOVERNOR ARE COMMITTED TO

00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:16.160
SPENDING.

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.461
IS ACTUALLY REVENUE THAT WE DO

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.862
HAVE IN HAND -- AND THEN THE

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.097
LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE WHICH

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:21.598
WE CAN TALK ABOUT EITHER TODAY

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:22.566
OR WHEN HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:23.834
SERVICES COMES OUT.

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.169
I KNOW THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:26.804
ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE GROWTH

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.404
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.206
SPENDING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.507
YEARS AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:43:30.574 --> 00:43:32.443
IMPORTANT TO GET THAT RIGHT

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:34.011
BECAUSE IF WE UNDER SHOOT THERE

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.412
THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:36.313
CONSEQUENCES SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.081
THAT.

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:38.115
WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT AS

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:40.217
WELL AND SO OVERALL YOU KNOW

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.052
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:46.991
PROCESS AND A THE BUDGET

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:47.558
CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:48.692
HAVING WITH YOU MEMBERS OF YOUR

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:50.160
STAFF -- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.295
BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:51.895
WHICH I KNOW SOMETHING WE ALL

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:52.896
AGREE ON REALLY IS THAT PREDATOR

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:53.564
TO EXPANDING PROGRAMS AND MAKING

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.398
A BUDGET THAT NOT ONLY WE CAN

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.833
STAND BEHIND THIS YEAR.

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:57.101
BUT IN THE YEARS TO COME AND SO

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.902
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.071
THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR.

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.339

COMMITTEES GREAT GREAT TO HAVE

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.412
YOU WE GOT USED TO HAVING A ME

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:09.913
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS SO IT'S

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.384
NICE TO HAVE. TO CHANGE IT UP A

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.052
LITTLE BIT.

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.487
QUICK QUESTIONS ON JUST TO

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:18.055
FOLLOW UP ON MY QUESTION --

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:20.524
TALLY HO WAS REGARDING THE

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.893
DECISION TO SUNSET WHAT WE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.527
PERCEIVE AS ONGOING.

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.728
PROGRAMS DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:27.431
IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES -- JUST

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.399
ONE UNDERSTAND WHY.

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:32.669
pTO ASSISTANCE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:35.572
DISINGENUOUS TO FUND THE PROGRAM

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:36.373
HOW.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.709
TO HIRE PEOPLE FOR TWO YEARS AND

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:39.243
THEN.

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.377
LAY THEM OFF SO I JUST TRY TO

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:41.345
UNDERSTAND.

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:43.280
WHAT YOUR THINKING WAS AROUND

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:45.416
THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE FOR US WE

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:48.419
WOULD RATHER NOT DO IT IF YOU'RE

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:49.486
GONNA ST?

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:54.625
SUNSET IT IN TWO YEARS THEN WHY

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.192
EVEN PUT IT IN THE BUDGET TO

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.226
BEGIN WITH.

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.061
YEAH SO THAT WAS NOT AN EASY

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:57.995
DECISION AS PART OF THAT NAY

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:58.595
REVISION WHEN THE GOVERNOR WAS

00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.096
THINKING THROUGH IT AND

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.831
BASICALLY FOR TWO REASONS ONE

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.599
MAJORITY KNOWLEDGE DAYS --

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:03.400
TRYING TO CREATE A STRUCTURAL

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:04.468
BALANCE IN THE OUT YEARS SO WE

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.970
FELT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.572
TO EXTEND THIS BE ON TWENTY

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.540
TWENTY ONE AND WE SIMPLY DON'T

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:11.408
HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.509
THAT I ACCEPT AND ONCE REVENUES

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:13.644
CHANGER THE WHOLE BUDGET

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.079
ARCHITECTURE CHANGES IN SOME WAY

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:16.313
WHICH IS A CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.214
LEGISLATURE.

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.816
AND THEN THE SECOND THING IN

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.418
THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS -- AND YOU

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:22.152
KNOW IT CAN BE EASY TO LOOK AT

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:23.053
THIS AND SAY THIS IS ALWAYS

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.154
GOING TO BE THIS WAY BUT WE TO

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:25.522
BELIEVE WHEN IT COMES TO

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.790
HEALTHCARE GENERALLY.

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.592
AND DDS MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.160
THE RATE STUDY THERE ARE A LOT

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.762
OF CHANGES IN A LOT OF REFORM

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:33.230
EFFORTS THAT ARE ON GOING SO WE

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.265
BELIEVE BY THE END OF TWENTY

00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:35.899
TWENTY ONE THAT'S MORE THAN TWO

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.367
YEARS FROM NOW -- THOSE

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.002
CONVERSATIONS WILL OF ADVANCED

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.871
AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:44.074
BE ABLE TO DELIVER A GREATER

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:47.044
LEVEL OF SERVICE WITH LESS COST.

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:49.246
SUE SO YOU'RE NOT ENVISIONING

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:50.080
THE THE WAY YOUR BUDGET

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.882
STRUCTURED YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:55.953
AND THEN LAY THEM OFF IN. TWENTY

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:56.587
TWENTY TWO YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:56.987
NOT WHERE YOU'RE.

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:58.055
ENVISIONED.

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:58.822
OVER IN BEIJING AT SUNSET RIGHT

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.524
NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT YOU

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:01.158
KNOW ONCE THOSE REFORM EFFORTS

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:02.526
HAVE TAKEN PLACE WHAT THOSE

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.160
EFFORTS WILL LOOK LIKE AT THAT

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.561
TIME BUT TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.063
QUESTION AND IF WE DON'T HAVE

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.699
THE MONEY -- WE HAVE TO FIND

00:46:08.765 --> 00:46:12.169
ANOTHER WAY TO GET THE MONEY.

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:12.836
SENATE FOR THESE ONGOING

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:15.639
PROGRAMS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING.

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.007
ABOUT.

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.842
YOU TO YOU'RE TALKING. TO TO TWO

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.077
FORMER HEADS OF NONPROFIT SO AS

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.145
FORMER HEADS OF NON PROFITS YOU

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.346
YOU'RE GIVEN MONEY.

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:24.148
FROM GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO HIRE

00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:26.116
PEOPLE TO DELIVER THE SERVICE

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.718
THAT YOU PROMISED TO GO.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:28.585
DELIVER.

00:46:28.652 --> 00:46:29.920
ANY BE HARD FOR US IN THIS

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:32.756
ECONOMY TO HIRE PEOPLE AND THEN

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.791
TELL THEM YOU CAN.

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:35.259
WHEN ARE YOU BUT ONLY

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.194
[inaudible] FOR TWO YEARS.

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.395
SAID THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:39.763
POSITION RIGHT NOW IS BEYOND

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.665
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE ON GOING

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.200
REVENUE TO FUND THOSE PROGRAMS

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.501
BEYOND THAT DATE.

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:47.204
AT THIS TIME SO WHY ARE THE IN

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.639
THE BUDGET WENT UP JUST HAVE

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.874
REAL ONE TIME.

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.009
EXPENDITURES INSTEAD OF HAVING

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:52.643
THESE THESE TWO THINGS IN THE

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:53.210
BUDGET.

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:54.611
I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS WE

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:56.246
SEE IT WE UNDERSTAND THOSE NEEDS

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:57.548
RIGHT NOW THIS RATE STUDY HAS

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:59.283
BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR A COUPLE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.552
OF YEARS -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.020
MEDICAID SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:04.655
TO INCREASE ACCESS WE WANT TO

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:06.957
INCREASE THOSE FOR PROPOSITION

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.059
FIFTY SIX FUNDING SOWE ENVISION

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.827
THIS AS A BRIDGE WHERE WE ARE

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:11.728
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE RE

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.130
GETTING A GREATER LEVEL SERVICE

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.498
WHICH AS YOU NOTED.

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.099
THERE IS THE DEMAND OUT THERE

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.735
WHILE WE WORK TOWARD A SOLUTION

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:22.606
THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IT IS A

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:24.274
DIFFICULT TO TO THE CAN ARE YOU

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.176
DOING. TO PROVIDING THIS HIGH

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:27.778
LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY TO TO THE

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:29.346
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.981
OUR STATE.

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.983
NO IT WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.351
TO INCLUDE THE SUNSET AND AS AS

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.619
YOU NOTED IT WAS NOT IN THE

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.954
JANUARY BUDGET IT IS SIMPLY

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.522
BECAUSE OUR REVENUE PICTURE FOR

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.625
THE OUT YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:42.226
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND AGAIN

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.393
THIS IS A PROCESS AS MENTIONED

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:43.594
THAT.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.028
WITH IT HAPPENS BEFORE THE

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.163
GOVERNOR MAKES ANY DECISIONS

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.831
ACTUALLY CAME IN AT ONE POINT

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:49.299
SIX BILLION DOLLARS LOWER THAN

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.534
WE PROJECTED.

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:51.969
AND SO THEY'RE SIMPLY -- GOIG

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.804
BACK TO THE PRINCIPLE MATCHING

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:54.771
ON GOING SPENDING WITH ON GOING

00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.473
REVENUE THERE SIMPLY WASN'T THE

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.342
ABILITY TO PUT THAT ON GOING

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.410
SPENDING AND BEYOND THAT YEAR.

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:01.812
PROGRAM WHICH WE WHICH WE TO

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:02.646
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THEN I WHAT

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:05.449
I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHY I WAS

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:08.418
EVEN IN THE BUDGET THAT.

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:08.986
WHY WAS IT WHY THE TWO YEAR

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:09.720
PROCESS BECAUSE WE DO WE DO

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:10.654
THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS

00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.822
TO DO AND SO IN ONE OF THE

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:12.723
THINGS WE ALWAYS DO WHEN THE

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:13.857
GOVERNOR'S AND ALL OF YOU?

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.192
MAKING YOUR DECISIONS THERE ARE

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:15.892
A LOT OF PIECES THAT ARE

00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:16.827
IMPORTANT AND WE'RE TRYING TO

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:17.394
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THEM

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.463
TOGETHER AND SO WE FELT WITH

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.932
THESE PIECES WHAT'S AT LEAST TRY

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.567
TO DO WHAT WE CAN WITH THESE TEN

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:24.134
MORE.

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:24.768
TO REVENUES ARE NOW MORE

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:25.402
TEMPORARY THAN WE THOUGHT THEY

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.437
WERE BEFORE EXPAND ACCESS NOW

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:29.206
AND HOPE WE CAN WORK TOWARD SOME

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:30.707
SOLUTION AND THAT'S WISHING TO

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:31.575
TAKE A NUMBER OF FORMS AT OUR

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.310
COMBINATION A COULD TAKE SOME

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.011
REFORM.

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.279
THERE COULD BE NEW REVENUES

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:36.647
EITHER IN THE LEGISLATURE THERE

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:37.648
CONTINUE REVENUES ON THE BALLOT

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:38.582
THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.883
COULD CHANGE BETWEEN NOW.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.551
AND THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:43.053
WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL THAT THE

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.921
REVENUE PICTURE COULD IMPROVE

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:45.589
YOU KNOW I KNOW WE'RE ALL

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.556
TALKING ABOUT DOOM AND GLOOM UP

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:47.157
HERE WITH THE INVERTED YIELD

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:48.325
CURVE BUT A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.593
COULD HAPPEN SO.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.361
IF THERE IS A WAY TO ENGAGE IN

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:52.596
THOSE REFORM EFFORTS AND

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.264
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN EQUAL OR

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.432
EVEN GREATER LEVEL OF SERVICE TO

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:57.467
PEOPLE WE DO WANT TO FIND A WAY

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.669
TO TO THAT.

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:01.138
BUT LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THEY-AMOUNT OF ONE TIME VERSUS I'M

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:01.905
GOING SPENDING THAT WE HAVE

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.774
RIGHT NOW WE SIMPLY WERE NOT

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.475
ABLE TO BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER AN

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:06.476
HONEST BUDGET THAT WE COULD

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:07.911
PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.113
EXTEND THOSE PROGRAMS BEYOND AND

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.750
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU.

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:15.986
TO QUESTION ON MCO TAX THAT THAT

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:16.787
WAS SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE THE

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.088
SENATE VERSION IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.556
VERSION INCLUDING -- JUST WANT

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.757
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.592
WHY THAT WAS INCLUDED.

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:23.894
I THINK I'LL SPEAK FOR OUR HOUSE

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.262
WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.631
REASONABLE PROPOSAL TO PUT IN

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:30.434
SPECIALLY SENSE -- MANY OF US.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.202
WHO HAVE BEEN HERE ACTUALLY

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.503
VOTED TO SUPPORT THAT?

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.139
TAX WITH INDUSTRY SUPPORT ALSO

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:37.674
GIVEN THE THE GOVERNOR'S HIGH

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.243
PRIORITY REGARDING HEALTH CARE

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:40.977
SMOKER.

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.846
OF SMART WAY TO FIND SOME OF THE

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.848
IMPORTANT HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:45.849
HE WAS PUTTING FORWARD SO JUST

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:46.416
WANNA.

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:48.385
GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHY

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:49.886
DOT TOSSING LIKE THE EASIEST OF

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:51.922
ALL THE DIFFERENT TAX PROPOSALS

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:52.923
PUT FORWARD.

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:53.690
THIS IS JUST ONE UNDERSTAND WHY

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:55.992
THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:56.526
BUDGET.

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:57.594
YEAH SO THE MAIN REASON WE WE

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:58.895
PUT TOGETHER BUDGET THAT FUNDED

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:00.731
THE ADMINISTRATION'S KEEP

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:01.698
PROPOSALS WITHOUT READ THAT

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:02.933
REVENUE WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:12.042
THE LEGISLATURE ON GETTING THAT

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.710
PACKAGE PASSED AND HOPEFULLY

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:14.277
GETTING FEDERAL APPROVAL BUT

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:15.345
IT'S SIMPLY NOT GUARANTEED AND

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:16.713
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS. ONE THING

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.314
HARDER THAN PREDICTING WHETHER

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:17.881
RECESSION WILL HAPPEN IT'S

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:18.515
PREDICTING WHAT'S GOING TO COME

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:19.116
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ON ANY

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:19.416
GIVEN DAY.

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:20.984
SO I THINK WE FELT THAT LET'S

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:21.618
GET TO THE BUDGET WHERE WE KNOW

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.320
BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS THAT

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:24.688
THESE REVENUES TO DATE THE BEST

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:25.856
CHANCE OF COMING IN.

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:26.590
AND THEN HEN IT COMES TO AN MCO

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.124
PACKAGE WERE APPROVAL IS

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.126
UNCERTAIN WE CAN WORK ON

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.394
CRAFTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.628
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.829
FROM THE LAST TIME OF THIS GO

00:50:32.896 --> 00:50:33.330
AROUND.

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.598
THESE MTO TAX PACKAGES ARE VERY

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:36.533
COMPLICATED I EVEN GOVERNOR

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:37.868
BROWN WHO HAS SOME EXPERIENCE IN

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:38.902
SACRAMENTO CLAIMS HE DIDN'T

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.270
UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF SO WE

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.872
REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.206
GET THE PARAMETERS EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.641
SO THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.777
OF APPROVAL IN DC AND WE KNOW

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:49.379
THAT THEY APPROVED A TAX IN OHIO

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.881
AND MOST RECENTLY IN MICHIGAN --

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:51.815
BUT WE JUST WANT TO DO

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:53.417
EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVE AND

00:50:53.483 --> 00:50:54.084
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.519
THAT NEEDS NO EXPLANATION TO

00:50:55.585 --> 00:50:56.286
MAKE SURE.

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:57.487
THAT WE ARE IN THE STRONGEST

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.623
POSSIBLE POSITION AND AS PART OF

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:01.425
THAT CONVERSATION -- GOVERNOR

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.759
WANTS TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:03.693
THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.228
ALLOCATE THOSE REVENUES -- BUT

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.730
WITH WE TO PUT IT IN THE BUDGET

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.498
PACKAGE AND FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:09.566
THOSE REVENUES DON'T COME

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:10.934
THROUGH IN THE WAY THAT WE INTO

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.269
ANTICIPATE.

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:14.104
AND WE HAD A NINE OR TEN SPEAKER

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:18.975
HOLE IN OUR BUDGET THAT WILL

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.311
HAVE TO PLUG LATER. TO TRULY%

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:22.412
APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND I

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:23.480
THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.248
THINK SOMEONE SHAMELESSLY WAS

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:25.782
QUOTED THAT HEALTHCARE IS

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.117
COMPLICATED.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.585
SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.686
THAT -- HAVE THE SAID THAT THIS

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.454
IS THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:32.088
REALLY NEEDS TO BE SOMEWHAT

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:32.923
ADMINISTRATION GLAD.

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:33.557
I KNOW THAT WHEN WE HAD REACHED

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.025
OUT TO THE MINISTRATION IN

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.960
JANUARY -- FOR ASSISTANCE IN

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:38.728
PARTICULAR FROM DH CS -- WE'RE

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:41.198
WERE UNABLE TO GET ASSISTANCE.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.999
SO WE WOULD REALLY HOPE THAT

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.301
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:46.036
DEPARTMENT PARTICULAR COULD WORK

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.537
WITH US ON THAT THERE SEEM TO BE

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:50.006
SIGNIFICANT MATTER RETICENCE TO

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:53.210
ACTUALLY ENGAGE WITH WASHINGTON.

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:54.444
YOU KNOW IN IN THIS IN THIS LINE

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:55.011
OF WORK IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:56.713
DON'T GET AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.914
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ASK -- WE'RE

00:51:57.981 --> 00:51:59.549
NOT GETTING AND THEN THE OTHER

00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.617
PIECE OF IT IS HIS YEAH I I

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:06.389
THINK THERE DEFINITELY IS A WAY.

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:09.092
TO AGAIN -- PROPOSAL ATTACKS BUT

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.060
THAT ALSO WE COULD SET ASIDE ALL

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.695
THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT WE

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.797
WERE FUNDING SO THAT IF WE CAN.

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:14.397
THEY DIDN'T COME TO FRUITION

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:14.931
THEY WOULD JUST END UP IN

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:17.400
RESERVE WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BE

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:20.303
FISCALLY PRUDENT WAY TO TACKLE

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.672

THERE'S AN ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:46.429
FOR OVERALL.

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.664
AND THEN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:48.832
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:51.301
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SO --

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:53.003
FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.104
AROUND THE CONCERN ON THE NCL

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:59.776
TAX AND AND AND OUR SUCCESS RATE

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:00.577
WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:01.177
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:02.112
THOSE.

00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:02.979
TWO IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:05.415
WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY YES

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:08.618
OKAY ALL RIGHT SENATOR NELSON.

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.220
YOU MENTIONED THE A BIT AGO

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:13.189
ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS AND USE

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:14.791
TEAM THE GOVERNOR SEEMS TO BE.

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:17.861
SENSITIVE TO THAT X. EXPANDED

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.596
ACCESS IN SOME AREAS.

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:20.697
AND THAT WOULD CARRY OVER I

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.165
TRUST.

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.533
TO POLICY BILLS THAT ARE MOVING

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.468
ALONG TO THERE ARE SOME THAT

00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:28.271
WOULD BE THE CREATING VERY HUGE

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:30.507
FUTURE OBLIGATIONS.

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.242
ALL I WOULD SAY IS I COMMEND

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.411
YOUR SENSITIVITY TO THAT AS YOU

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:36.880
EXPAND ACCESS IN YOUR BUILDING

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:39.282
THE BASE FOR THE FUTURE AGAIN

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.384
THAT'S A QUESTION.

00:53:41.451 --> 00:53:43.753
ABOUT MOVING AHEAD IN THE FUTURE.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.422
AND THE SAME WOULD HOLD TRUE TO

00:53:45.488 --> 00:53:47.390
WATCH WE JUST HAD A LITTLE BIT

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:48.692
OF DISCUSSION ABOUT.

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.060
PERSONNEL YEARSAND BEING

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:54.164
TEMPORARY OR LONG TERM POSITIONS.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.865
IT'S LONG BEEN A DEFLECTION IN

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:57.367
OUR BUDGET.

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.904
THE AGENCIES -- WELL THEY GET

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.273
HUNGRY FOR MORE PERSONNEL.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.674
AND THEIR ANSWER TO EVERY

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.644
PROBLEM IS MORE P. WEISS -- IT

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.746
ANOTHER AREA THAT DOES REQUIRE I

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:12.115
BELIEVE ATTENTION.

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:14.084
AND WITHIN THAT CONTEXT ANOTHER

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.852
AREA THAT WE'VE LET GET OUT OF

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.821
CONTROL IT IS NOT BEEN A BUDGET

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.356
BUSTER BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:21.424
BUDGET PRESSURE.

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:25.295
IS ALLOWING ACCRUED ANNUAL LEAVE.

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:28.098
THAT IS CASHED OUT.

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:29.799
THE BEEN ATTEMPTS.

00:54:29.866 --> 00:54:31.835
TO THE DOPE CURTAIL THAT A BET.

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:33.837
ON THE PAST BUT ALL OF WHICH

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:36.039
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL -- THIS IS

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:38.341
AGAIN JUST A PRECAUTION AS WE

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.643
BUILD OUR BUDGET AND AS WE'VE

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.746
EVEN HAD THESE VERY DIFFICULT

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:47.183
TIMES IN CALIFORNIA DOWN VERY

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.586

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IS AN

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:52.722
EXAMPLE.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.091
SO WE DO HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.527
THESE P. WEISS INCREMENTALLY

00:54:57.594 --> 00:54:59.429
THEY CAN BE COME BIG PROBLEMS

00:54:59.496 --> 00:55:04.000
DOWN THE WAY.

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:07.470
AND SENATOR MORE LOCK.

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:10.473

SEE WHAT THE LATEST IS -- AND OF

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:19.242
COURSE THAT IS SOMETHING

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.977
ULTIMATELY THAT IS UP TO THE

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.346
STATE COMPTROLLER BUT OUR FOLKS

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.714
ARE IN VERY CLOSE TOUCH WITH

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:25.181

FOR LAST YEAR HAD AN

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:32.388
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:33.022
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:33.957
BILLION.

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:37.360
AND IF WE ADD TO THAT -- EIGHTY

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:37.961
SIX TO NINETY ONE BILLION IN

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:39.996
UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL WE'RE

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:40.530
GETTING CLOSE TO A QUARTER

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:41.931
TRILLION.

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.600
DOLLARS SO IT'S KIND OF ONE

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.435
THING TO TALK ABOUT A SURPLUS OF

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.337
TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.238
BUT WE LOOK AT THE BALANCE SHEET

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:50.039
IT'S LIKE.

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.708
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A LONG WAYS

00:56:51.775 --> 00:56:53.076

ADDRESSING THE RETIREE MEDICAL

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:56.546
AN INADEQUATE [inaudible]

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:58.748
FASHION.

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:00.383
SO YES THE STATE DOES HAVE ABOUT

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.584
PLANS TO PAY DOWN ALL THOSE

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.286
LIABILITIES ON THE LONG TERM OF

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:04.053
COURSE.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.356
ALL YOU CAN DO IS STAY AS CLOSE

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:07.590
TO THAT PLAN AS POSSIBLE YEAR TO

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:08.992
YEAR AND WHEN YOU DO HAVE AN

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:10.360
OPPORTUNITY TO DO.

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:12.328
EVEN MORE WHEN THE PLAN CALLS

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:13.763
FOR BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW AS A CPA

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.665
THESE DISCOUNT RATES THE ACTUAL

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:17.567
RATE OF RETURN CAN FLCTUATE

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:17.867
OVER TIME.

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:18.868
SO WHEN YOU DO HAVE AN

00:57:18.935 --> 00:57:21.004
OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE THAN

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.005
EIGHTY GIVES YOU TO TAKE THE

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.506
OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PUT IN

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:24.407
MORE AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:26.042
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES SO

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.210
SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.711
OUR THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:29.712
TO CALPERS.

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.681
AND ALSO TO CAL STIRS AT THE

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:32.715
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S WAS

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:33.917
TALKING ABOUT THE PAYMENTS ON

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.518
BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:37.053
BUT THEY'RE ALSO PAYMENTS THAT

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.987
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:38.521
TO MAKE.

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:40.123
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BECAUSE

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.658
THE STATE PORTION OF THE CAL

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.026
STIRS LIABILITY IS IN THE

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.260
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY FIVE

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:45.628
BILLION DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:46.563
LIABILITY.

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.198
SO WE'RE PROPOSING ONE POINT ONE

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:49.599
BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSITION

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.100
TWO PAYMENTS IN THIS BUDGET PLUS

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.702
AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.370
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE OUT YEARS

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:55.638
AND I BELIEVE THAT ONE POINT ONE

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:56.139
BILLION IN.

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:57.373

WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE VERY

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:02.846
IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.914

AT THAT UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:07.984
BUT WE DO THINK THAT STEPS LIKE

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:10.086
THIS AND I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:12.255

AFTER WE FINISH THE BUDGET WHEN

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.685

THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:24.093
THAT'S I WANT TO SAY BEING

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.595
HIDDEN BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:27.163

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:35.638
LIKE TO ECHO.

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.941
SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MR

00:59:38.007 --> 00:59:40.109
TANG MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATIN WITH

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:41.611
THEADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WAS

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:42.879
THE CHARACTERIZATION.

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:45.915
OF MANY OF THE EXPENDITURES AS

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:47.216
ONE TIME WHEN THEY WERE CLEARLY

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:48.518
ONGOING.

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:49.118
AND I JUST THINK DON'T THINK

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:51.487
THAT THAT'S A TRANSPARENT WAY OF

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:52.355
APPROACHING.

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.556
BUDGETING A MISTER TING ASK YOU

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.757
ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMMATIC

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:56.426
ELEMENTS THAT COULD BE

00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:57.694
CHARACTERIZED THAT WAY.

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.828
YEAH I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME OF THE

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.830
NONPROFIT PROGRAMMATIC ONES FOR

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:01.097
EXAMPLE.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.933
OF THE ELIMINATION OF SALES TAX

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.369
ON FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS AND

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.671
DIAPERS I USED TO QUé BUT A

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:09.639
SUNSET ON THAT.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.273
NOW THERE'S A SUNSET ON H. OR

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.774
SAYS READ PROVIDER RATE

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:12.542
INCREASES.

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.043
I DON'T THINK EITHER OF THOSE

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.312
ARE THINGS THAT ARE LIKELY IN

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:18.681
TWO YEARS TO BE ROLLED BACK SO I

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.016
WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:25.421
WHY YOU CHARACTERIZE THOSE AS

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:27.357
ONE TIME INSTEAD OF ON GOING.

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.825
SO FOR THE AYE HSS -- THAT

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:29.726
SIMILAR TO SOME THE OTHER

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.326
PROGRAMS TALKED ABOUT WITH MR

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:30.827
TANKS AND A WE HAD THAT

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:31.761
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THE

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.029
FISCAL SITUATION WILL LOOK LIKE

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.697
IN TWO YEARS AND WHETHER THERE

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:35.498
WILL BE.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.133
ANY SORTS OF REFORM EFFORTS IN

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.434
THIS AREA BY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.036
WHEN IT COMES TO SPECIFICALLY

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.371
THE FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:42.805
AND A DIAPER AT SALES TAX

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.040
EXEMPTION.

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.308
THESE ARE NEW MEMBER NEW

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.409
MEASURES UP PROPOSED BY THE

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.778
GOVERNOR SO -- NUMBER ONE AND WE

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:50.079
WILL ASSESS THE IMPACT OVER THE

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.714
UPCOMING YEARS BUT NUMBER TWO WE

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.216
SELL TO THAT IF WE ARE IN A

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.951
POSITION WHERE ADD TO THE

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:55.952
DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:56.953
A MEASURES THAT ARE VERY

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.454
IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.622
INCLUDING MEMBER THE

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.657
ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR ARE

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.893
BEING SUNSET AID DâN AT NEW

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.594
MEASURES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING BY.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.995
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:07.296
HAVE THE ON GOING BROKE MAN

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.732
BECAUSE GIVEN THE UPDATED MULTI

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.200
YOUR FORECAST -- UNDER OUR

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:12.802
PROJECTIONS WE WEREN'T CONFIDENT

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:13.603
THAT WE HAD THE ROOM TO INCLUDE

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:15.371
THOSE AS WELL WE THOUGHT LET'S

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.206
DO IT FOR TWO YEARS THIS IS AN

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:17.774
IMPORTANT POLICY SOMETHING

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.375
OFFICE CARE ABOUT.

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:20.877
BUT WE CAN REVISIT IT AT THAT

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:23.012
TIME IN THAT BUDGET CYCLE.

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:24.914
OKAY WELL I MEAN I I THINK THAT.

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:26.849
OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.419
THAT THOSE WILL BE ROLLED BACK

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.019
IN FUTURE LEADER YEARS IS VERY

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:30.420
LOW.

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:31.421
WHO MAYBE A LITTLE POLITICAL

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.488
FEASIBILITY?

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:34.924
I WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.692
CHARACTERIZING THAT SO.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:37.593
I THINK IT'S MORE ON IS JUST TO

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.795
SAY THIS IS THIS IS AN ONGOING

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.129
EXPENSES NOT A ONE TIME EXPENSE

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.197
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.598
MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:44.634
ADJUSTMENTS IN.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.469
FUTURE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.337
OUR BALANCE OUR BUDGET CONTINUES

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.072
TO BE BALANCED I THINK THAT

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.440
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.507
DO SO SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:52.842
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.444
ADMINISTRATION ON THAT AND

01:01:54.510 --> 01:02:01.851
HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK THAT OUT

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.953
AS OUR HEARINGS OR CONTINUE.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.021
THANK YOU I WOULD JUST ADD TO

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:07.090
THAT -- EACH IN TERMS OF THE

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.491
APPROPRIATENESS OF A PROGRAM TO

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:09.959
SUNSET SOME OF THE MEDI CAL

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:10.393
OPTIONAL BENEFITS.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.294
THAT WE'VE TRIED FOR A COUPLE

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.995
YEARS NOW TO GET KIND OF BACK IN

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:16.432
THE MIX ONE OF THEM IS OPTICAL --

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.668
AND I SHARE THE CONCERNS

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.269
EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.238
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE THAT.

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:22.805
IF WE'RE GOING TO START TO

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.173
PROVIDE OPTICAL THAT I WOULD NOT

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.575
WANT TO BE A SITTING MEMBER OF

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:27.376

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:27.977
AGAIN.

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.079
IT'S SO DEEPLY OFFENSIVE TO ME

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.582
THAT WE COVER OPTOMETRY WE TELL

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.817

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.403
MR MCCARTY FOLLOWED BY MR

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.205
OBERNOLTE JUST A QUICK QUESTION

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.539
IN IN FOLLOWING UP ON MISTER

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:02.311
MORLOCKS POINT -- FOR IT'S MY

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:03.612
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S UNCLEAR

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:04.947
BASED ON THE PROPOSITION WHETHER

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.749
OR NOT THESE FUNDS -- MAY BE

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:10.819
PROGRAM TO THE BUDGET PROCESS --

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:11.754
DO YOU.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.288
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION OR FEEL

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:15.124
DIFFERENTLY.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.291
SO THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:17.860
CITY ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.795
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE'S A

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.096
LOT OF DETAIL ON THE ACTUAL

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.565
LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:24.166
FOUR IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:24.700
NOW.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.101
IT HAPPENS A DECADE OR SO DOWN

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:28.570
THE ROAD BUT RIGHT NOW -- THE

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:29.872
ADMINISTRATION'S INTERPRETATION

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.607
OF THE PROPOSITION IS THAT WE

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:34.076
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM BE

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.744
SPECIFIC FUNDS -- SO LONG AS IT

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:38.547
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:39.081
THE PROPOSITION AS WE WERE

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:40.415
DISCUSSING.

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.751
THOUGHT MOVEMENT IN THIS INTO

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:43.352
THE TABLES WOULD LIKE TO HEAR

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:44.153
FROM THE LA -- AS WELL HI HOW

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:44.787
INTERESTING AT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:45.854
ANALYST'S OFFICE SO OUR

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:46.855
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.657
SOME LACK OF CLARITY ON EXACTLY

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:50.192
HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.260
DIRECT THESE TO THE FUNDS.

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:52.361
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.662
WHY THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE ONE

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:54.363
IS THAT THE FUNDS ARE

01:13:54.429 --> 01:13:56.165
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.366
CERTAIN DEPARTMENTS THERE'S ALSO

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.201
SOME LANGUAGE IN THE MEASURE

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.637
THAT -- THAT THAT -- LMITS THE

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:04.039
AUTHORITY POTENTIALLY -- OF THE

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.941
LEGISLATURE TO ADJUST

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:08.544
ALLOCATIONS TO PROGRAMS -- UP

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.978
THROUGH THE NEXT ABOUT ROUGHLY

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.914
ALMOST TEN YEARS -- AND EXACTLY

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.115
WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK THERE'S

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.650
A LACK OF CLARITY SO WHAT IS AN

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.318
ALLOCATION TO A PROGRAM IS THAT

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.587
HAVE SPECIFIC IS THAT -- AND I

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:19.354
THINK THAT'S PART OF WHERE

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.690
pLEGAL GRAY AREA SO IT'S

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.292
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.227
COULD CERTAINLY -- CONCERT TO

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.328
CONSULT WITH COUNSEL ON IF

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.030
THEY'RE FURTHER QUESTIONS BUT I

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.464
THINK THAT'S WHERE WHERE THERE'S

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.265
POTENTIALLY SOME LEGAL

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:31.366
UNCERTAINTY THAT'S VERY

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.568
DIFFERENT FROM OUR EXPERIENCE

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:33.869
WITH PROP TEN FOR EXAMPLE

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.337
ANOTHER IS THAT THAT WE WERE

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:41.677
VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAD --

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:42.544
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY.

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.345
YEAH I THINK THERE'S LESS

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:43.946
CLARITY HERE THAN IN IN SOME

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.414
OTHER AREAS BECAUSE OF THAT BUT

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.048
CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:46.915
THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.717
EXPLORE AND WE THINK THERE'S A

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.452
STRONG ROLE FOR OVERSIGHT.

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:51.253
AND CERTAINLY FOR THE

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.421
ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH THE

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:54.323
LEGISLATURE ON THESE ALLOCATIONS

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:56.091
REGARDLESS.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.961
THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:00.829
THANK YOU I I THINK THERE'S A

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.699
LOT OF PIECES HERE RIGHT PEOPLE

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:06.101
WITH THE AFTER SCHOOL PIECE --

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.903
AND I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE IS

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.771
THAT THE JANUARY BUDGET DIDN'T

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.607
FOCUS ON CHILD CARE SO MUCH HAD

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.108
PRESCHOOL ACCESS AND SO.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.810
PLEASE AT THE MAY REVISE IN THE

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.478
SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY ALL

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.513
PRIORITIZE INCREASING CHILD CARE

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.582
ACCESS SO THAT'S A BIG POSITIVE

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.951
AND IT'S AN FOR SAID THEY WERE

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:25.287
KIND OF PITTING AFTER SCHOOL

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:25.821
VERSES.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:27.656
CHILD CARE BUT I THINK THE FIRST

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:29.224
THING IS THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.460
APPROACH TO ADDRESS TO TO SUMMER

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:33.328
MITCHELL SO THE FIRST PRPOSAL.

01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.030
IT WAS BROUGHT AS FAR AS WHAT

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.065
THE SIXTY SIXTY FOUR MONTHS AGO

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:37.666
TO AND THEN YOU CLARIFY THAT

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:38.967
WOULD GO.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.369
TO THAT THE VOUCHER PROGRAM AND

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:45.040
YOU'RE SAYING ZERO THREE

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:45.674
THIRTEEN BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.442
MOST KIDS.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.610
MOST MOST MOST THE VOUCHER

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:49.578
PROGRAM THE DOCTOR PROGRAM WOULD

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:49.912
GO [inaudible]

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.914
TO YOUNGER KIDS. ZERO THREE FIVE

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.284
RIGHT.

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.218
THAT IS NOT A THAT IS NOT

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:56.852
CORRECT FOR ALL OF OUR VOUCHER

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.320
PROGRAM SO IT REALLY DEPENDS

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.389
UPON THE THE AGE RANGE OF THE

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:01.823
CHILDREN SERVE REALLY DEPENDS

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.126
UPON -- EITHER THE CAL WORKS

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.762
STAGE THAT THEY'RE IN -- OR

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.163
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE IN A CAL

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.265
WORKS VOUCHER PROGRAM -- MY

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:11.967
UNDERSTANDING IS FOR LIKE OUR

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.970
STAGE THREE PROGRAMS AND OUR ARE

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:17.406
A P. PROGRAM -- THERE ACTUALLY

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:19.074
ARE QUITE A LARGE PORTION OF THE

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:21.743
POPULATION THAT'S BEING SERVED

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.145
THAT IS AGES SIX TO THIRTEEN

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.012
OKAY MYBE A LARGE BUT IT ARE

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:27.316
THERE MORE THAT ARE BELOW. FIVE

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:28.383
FOR EXAMPLE FIVE NO THAT'S NOT

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.818
MY UNDERSTANDING I I CAN PULL UP

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.119
IN PROVIDER OFFICE WITH THE

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.355
EXACT PERCENTAGES BASED ON OUR

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.356
MOST RECENT INFORMATION FOR THE

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:34.990
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I DON'T

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.191
HAVE THAT WITH YOU RIGHT NOW BUT

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.526
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:39.127
MAJORITY OF CHILDREN SERVED AT

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:39.361
LEAST.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.363
IN THOSE PROGRAMS -- ARE OF THE

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.597
SCHOOL AGE OKAY I WITH MY

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:47.903
EXPERIENCE TO RUN IN ONE THAT

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.438
THEIR YOUNGER NOW.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.273
AND THEN -- WILL EITHER WAY ALL

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.475
HOUSES ABOUT TWO HOUSES IN THE

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.077
GOVERNOR WENT TO PRIORITIZE

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:55.944
ABOUT JUST LOTS OF THAT THAT'S A

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.379
GIVEN AND TO THE HOUSES ONE OF

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.548
FOCUS ON AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:00.449
LATER ON I I THINK IT'S CLEAR

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.049
THAT.

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:02.751
WE CAN YOU KNOW GO BACK AND WORK

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.853
BUT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT YOUR

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.188
HONORING THE WILL OF OTHERS.

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.723
IS VERY CLEAR WHEN THEY WROTE

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.858
THIS PROP SIXTY FOUR THE WITH BY

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.793
THE GOVERNOR IN THE BALLOT

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:14.529

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:16.098
TAX REGULATE.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:16.932
MARIJUANA CAN USE THAT MONEY IS

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.900
TO FOCUS ON PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.402
SCHOOL PROGRAMS THEY DID MENTION

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.903
CHILD CARE PROGRAMS WERE PLAYING

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.505
IN THE GENERAL FUND.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:24.006
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR TV

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:24.573
COMMERCIAL [inaudible]

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:27.342

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:42.457
THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND I

01:17:42.524 --> 01:17:44.259
THINK THIS IS BEING YOU KNOW TOO

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.527
CUTE BY HALF.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.229
A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS MEASURE

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.097
IS FINALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED SO

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:50.332
WE SHOULD KEEP THAT.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.366
IN CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:54.936
ALONG THE PROCESS [inaudible]

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.606
THIRTY NIELSEN [inaudible]

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:58.640
RUSSIAN ANALYST.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:17:59.975
CANNABIS REBEL TAX REVENUES OF

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:03.879
THE NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT WAS

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:04.846
EXPECTED.

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.348
OF A LOT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.649
SOUGHT THE GRAVY TRAIN WAS

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:09.584
COMING.

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.119
AND IT APPEARS THAT TO AN AWFUL

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.487
LOT OF THOSE TAXES ARE BEING

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:14.423
AVOIDED.

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:16.391
ISN'T THAT OCCURRED TO ME THE

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:17.592
CONCERNED WHEN I FIRST READ THIS

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.561
I SAID WHAT WE'RE BASING THIS ON

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:23.031
THESE REVENUES BUT SO FAR.

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.399
IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:26.435
THAT SIXTY FIVE WE'VE NOT SEEN

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.236
THE THE BONANZA THAT WAS

01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:30.605
EXPECTED FROM TAXES FROM.

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:33.642
MARIJUANA HAVE WE SO I THINK

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.210
THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:36.545
LACK OF CERTAINTY ON WHAT THESE

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.046
REVENUES WOULD BE PARTICULARLY

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.581
IN THE EARLY YEARS AND THAT'S

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.550
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- OUR

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.685
OFFICE IS NOTED -- IN THE PAST

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:45.120
IS THAT SUCH A WITH A NEW

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.322
INDUSTRY THAT'S RAMPING UP --

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.723
THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.059
UNCERTAINTY ON REVENUE SO YES --

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.160
I YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.361
THE REVENUE TO COME AND I'M

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:55.230
SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THAN THE

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:56.865
ADMINISTRATION ORIGINALLY.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:19:00.102
ANTICIPATED -- BUT IT'S I THINK

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.470
UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHERE WE THINK

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.605
THAT THAT ONE I THINK THAT THAT

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:04.673
ESTIMATES THAT THE

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:05.540
ADMINISTRATION'S COME FORWARD

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.609
WITH ARE PROBABLY IN THE

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:10.078
REASONABLE RANGE ON AND TWO I

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.246
THINK THAT THERE'S A LACK OF

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.481
CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.149
ULTIMATE REVENUES MIGHT BE AND

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.350
CERTAINLY THEY MAY.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.953
WILL GROW OVER TIME -- SO I

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:22.090
THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST A VERY

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:24.326
DIFFICULT THING TO PROTECT.

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:24.926
HI CLINT COME DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:27.796
FINANCE I JUST TO CLARIFY TO WE

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.464
ESTIMATED -- TO THIS EIGHTY

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.733
MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO

TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.106
DOLLARS OF TAX REVENUE BEING --

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:41.176
RECEIVED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:42.777

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.613
QUARTER TAX PAYENT THAT IS

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:45.480
TRAINING IN LINE WITH OUR

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.715
ESTIMATE AND ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:48.350
ABOVE SO WE DO HAVE SOME

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:49.217
EVIDENCE THAT.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:52.420
THIS SHOULD BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:55.157
AMOUNT.

THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TELL

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:09.771
VOTERS ONE THING AND THEY

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:10.739

APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.175
IN -- MONEY.

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:47.943
FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:48.743
SOMETHING THAT HAVE BEEN VERY

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.912
MUCH OF A BIG FAN OF I THINK ONE

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:51.513
THING.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.582
THAT -- SORT OF CHANGE AT LEAST

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:54.616
ON MY THINKING WAS ALEJO'S

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.219
TESTIMONY AND SENT TO THIS YEAR.

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.320
REGARDING.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.521
WHAT DISTRICTS HAD ACTUALLY USED

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.256
THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.724
FUNDING AND ALSO WHAT DISTRICTS?

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.992
NEED KINDERGARTEN FACILITY

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:07.362
FUNDING AS WELL AS WHICH

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.496
DISTRICTS HAVE FULL DAY

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:09.564
KINDERGARTEN WHICH ONES DON'T

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:12.901
AND I THINK MY ASSUMPTION BEFORE

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:14.236
A GO IN THIS PRESENTATION WAS

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:15.503
THAT MANY OF THE DISTRICTS IN

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:18.240
NEED WERE THE ONES THAT -- HAD

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.975
NOT MOVE TOWARD FULL DAY

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.576
KINDERGARTEN WHERE HE WAS.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:22.811
BASED ON THE LA ANALYSIS THAT

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.412
ACTUALLY HE WAS IN FACT THE

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:26.748
OPPOSITE WHERE.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.350
DISTRICTS THAT WERE IN THE MORE

01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.919
AFFLUENT AREAS WERE THE ONES WHO

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:32.721
PURPOSELY DECIDED THEY DIDN'T

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:33.288
WANT FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.490
BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE PEOPLE

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.592
PICK UP THEIR KIDS AT NOON --

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.261
UNLIKE OTHER OTHER AREAS WHERE

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.562
YOU HAD TO GET A WORKING

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.998
FAMILIES WHO REALLY NEEDED --

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:43.732
FULL DAY.

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:45.433
SCHOOL SO -- THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.901
REASONS WE ENDED UP.

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.370
DOING CUTTING THAT NUMBER A

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:50.839
PARTICULAR -- BECAUSE WE FELT

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:53.141
THAT -- THERE WASN'T AS MUCH OF

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.609
A NEED AS WE HAD THOUGHT.

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:56.244
AND PUTTING SOME OF THAT MONEY

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.813
MORE TOWARD ONGOING SLOT SUCH AS

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.614
WANTING FELLOW COULD JUST AGAIN

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.016
SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:04.185
THAT ANALYSIS THEY DID REGARDING --

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:07.289
THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES AND

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.157
WHERE THE MONEY IT WAS GOING AS

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.693
WELL AS HER THAT THE NEED.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:22.804
BEHIND -- WHO ACTUALLY?

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.339
MAKE CHOICES AROUND FOR THE

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:27.175
KINDERGARTEN VERSUS VERSUS NOT

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:27.475
[inaudible]

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:34.215
FOLKS CAMILLA [inaudible]

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.884
WHAT?

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.052
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE I'M

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.353
SO WE DO JUST WANT TO REMIND THE

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.888
COMMITTEE THAT WE WILL BE

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:40.755
SPEAKING ON FULL DAY

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:45.193
KINDERGARTEN ON ISSUE.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.761
NINE BUT FOR THE TIME BEING.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.396
WOULD YOU MIND JUST READ THE

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:50.198
QUESTION REALLY QUICKLY SURE

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:50.398
JUST.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:52.033
I THOUGHT THE THE PRESENTATION

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.936
YOU MADE IN SUBCOMMITTEE WAS I

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.371
THINK THEY'RE INTERESTING WHAT

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.740
ONE OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS GOING

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.342
INTO THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.409
AS WAS GOING IN THIS YEAR'S

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:04.179
BUDGET WAS -- ONE OF THE MAIN

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.180
REASONS WE HAVE SUCH A DIFFICULT

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.382
TASK WITH PRESCHOOL SLOTS.

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.551
IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WAS REALLY

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.885
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FACILITIES

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:12.921
WE HOPE THAT HAVING MORE

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.956
CONSTRUCTION OF KINDERGARTEN

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:16.524
CLASSROOMS AND ALSO ASSISTED THE

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:17.692
PRESCHOOL UPTICK.

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:19.027
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE WE'VE ALWAYS

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:20.829
BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.263
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.466
YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT DISTRICTS

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:25.633
ACTUALLY.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.801
DIDN'T HAVE FULL DAY

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.036
KINDERGARTEN AND WHAT WHAT

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:29.637
DISTRICTS I'M MORE SORT OF

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:31.706
ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:34.142
KINDERGARTEN FACILITY MONEY WAS

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.176
I THINK YOU KNOW VERY

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.445
INTERESTING AND AND ALSO CHANGE

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:38.813
OUR THINKING.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.848
AROUND THIS WHICH IS WHY WE

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.616
ENDED P LOWERING THE GOVERNOR'S

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:46.888
NUMBER A LITTLE BIT AND PUTTING

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.990
SOME MORE MONEY TOWARDS SLOTS.

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:49.624
SO IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF GO

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:49.958
THROUGH WHAT.

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.226
A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU FOUND.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.861
IN TERMS OF WHO.

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.561
WHAT?

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:54.863
WHO'S NOT PARTICIPATING IN FOR

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.664
THE KINDERGARTEN -- WHO IS

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.900
ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.703
KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES --

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.905
GRANTSGET AGAIN WE ONE MILLION

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.273
SO PRESCRIBED.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.609
BUT THEN ALSO -- IDENTIFYING

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.778
WHETHER OR NOT THE MOST NEEDY

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:11.179
DISTRICTS ARE IN FACT TAKING

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:16.217
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE FUNDS SURE OF

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.052
COURSE.

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:18.820
I THINK YOUR MOSTLY REFERENCING

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.054
THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:21.456
THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR FULL DAY

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:22.557
KINDERGARTEN THOUGHT.

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.526
I FOR KINDERGARTEN FACILITY

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:25.794
GRANTS LAST YEAR -- SOONER

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:26.761
UNDERSTANDING HAVE WITH THEIR

01:24:26.828 --> 01:24:29.130
FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS.

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:30.165
EIGHT BECAUSE OF HOW THEIR

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:32.000
PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED A LOT OF

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.234
THE GRANTS AND IT'S GOING TO

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.335
DISTRICTS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:35.236
RUNNING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.572
AND I'M IN TERMS OF TARGETING

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:39.541
THOSE GRANTS TOWARDS.

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:40.141
LOW INCOME DISTRICT THAT ARE

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.342
RUNNING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN WE

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:43.178
FOUND THAT MOST OF THE DISTRICTS

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.979
RUNNING PART DAY KINDERGARTEN IN

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.448
THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:49.717
BIT HIGHER INCOME -- IN SO WAY

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:50.185
THAT STRESS PART OF

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:55.623
CONSIDERATION AS A LEGISLATURE

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.659
DECIDES -- TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.626
IT WENT TO STRUCTURE THE GRANT

01:24:58.693 --> 01:24:59.227
PROGRAM MOVING ON I THINK THE

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:00.061
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:02.964
FOUND WHERE THEY WERE SEVERAL --

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:05.333
OTHER CONSTRAINTS DISTRICTS FACE

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.235
WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO RUN PER

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:12.907
DAY VERSUS FULL DAY KINDERGARTN

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:13.475
AND MOST OF THOSE WERE NOT

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.375
NECESSARILY RELATED TO FACILITY

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.177
CONSTRAINTS -- WE FOUND THAT

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.079
FIRST.

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.113
OUR FRIENDS PLAYED INTO THE

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.014
DECISION AS TO WHAT DISTRICTS

01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:22.116
WOULD RUN SOME PARENTS JUST HAVE

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:22.917
FOR THEIR CHILD'S ATTEND A

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:23.751
SHORTER DAY PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:24.919
BELIEVE.

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.387
THAT A LONGER PROGRAM IS NOT A

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.889
SUIT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:28.790
THAT YOUNG.

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:31.493
A SECOND -- PART OF THIS WAS

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:32.694
TEACHER PREFERENCE SO SOME

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.195
TEACHERS JUST PREFERRED HAVE

01:25:34.262 --> 01:25:35.630
PART DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:38.766
AND THESE TEACHERS MAY GO ON TO

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.768
PROVIDE OTHER AND SECTION ON AN

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:41.669
INJECTION DURING OTHER PARTS OF

01:25:41.736 --> 01:25:44.539
THE DAY SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:45.240
MIGHT TEACH SCIENCE.

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:46.441
OR MATH TWO OLDER KIDS OR THEY

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:49.511
MIGHT BE PULLING STUDENTS OUT

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:50.378
FROM OTHER CLASSROOMS FOR

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.579
INTENSIVE READING --

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:52.580
INTERVENTIONS AND THEN A THIRD

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.815
ISSUE THAT WE FOUND WAS SOME

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:54.949
DISTRICTS HAD CHALLENGES FINDING

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:57.352
A ON GOING SOURCE FOR STAFF

01:25:57.418 --> 01:25:58.653
FUNDING IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.421
STAFF THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. TO

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:01.856
CONVERT AND RUN FULL DAY

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:04.259
PROGRAMS AND SO AN OVERALL WE

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.627
FOUND THAT.

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:06.961
WHEN HE CAME?

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.630
TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE RUNNING

01:26:08.696 --> 01:26:09.197
PART DAY KINDERGARTEN THAT

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.598
PICTURE IS REALLY JUST A LITTLE

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:15.270
BIT MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.939
FACILITIES ALONE.

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.675
THANK YOU SO CELLS LIKE.

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:21.242
WITH THAT ANALYSIS IT WASN'T

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:21.776
THAT.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:25.013
DISTRICTS WHO WERE -- NOT DOING

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:26.414
DISTRICTS WERE DOING PART TIME

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:28.383
CAN CARDS HAS LIKE A LOT THAT

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:28.883
WAS BY CHOICE IT WASN'T

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:29.217
NECESSARILY.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.251
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RESOURCES

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.520
OR CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.989
THAT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:37.492
WELL THANK YOU.

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:40.695
THANK YOU -- I I I THINK THE

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:42.130
LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED AFTER

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.865
SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I'VE ALWAYS

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:44.699

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:46.701
FELT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE WHEN WE

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.803
ALLOWED ONE GROUP ONE SERVICE

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:49.604
OFFERING TO BE PITTED AGAINST

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.105

THE PROP -- SIXTY FOUR

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.878
PROPONENTS ADVERTISE AN AFTER

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.780
SCHOOL BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.114
GET CAUGHT UP IN SEMANTICS

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:01.749
THERE'S A WHOLE POPULATION OF

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.685
WORKING PARENTS WHO DON'T HAVE

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:05.053
THE LUXURY OF PICKING THEIR

BENEFIT OF THE A. P. SLOT

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.393
PROGRAM IS THOSE ARE AFTER

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.462

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.757
THAT I WOULD THINK THAT PART OF

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:57.658
THE CONCERN THAT THAT WE HAD

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:58.593
WITH THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW THE

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:00.394
THE WAY THAT THE PRESCHOOL

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.049
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THIS PROGRAM

TO BE LARGER OR LONGER DURING

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:23.951
THE DAY I THINK THE WAY THAT WE

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.019
ARE AT THE STATE.

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:25.520

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.023
ENOUGH FUNDING FOR ALL ELIGIBLE

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.591
CHILDREN IS TO SAY LOW INCOME

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:31.526
FAMILIES.

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:34.061
WHERE -- WHERE THERE IS SOMEBODY

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:35.096
AVAILABLE FOR CARE YOU CAN USE

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:37.131
THOSE THE PARTY PROGRAM IF YOU

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.599
HAVE PARENTS WORKING OR IN

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.133
SCHOOL AND THERE'S NOBODY

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.034
AVAILABLE FOR CAN YOU CAN BE

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.269
ELIGIBLE FOR THE FULL DAY?

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:42.203
WE THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:44.705
REASONABLE WAY TO PRIORITIZE THE

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:46.507
WAY THAT WE USE OUR FUNDING TO

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:47.809
MAKE SURE THAT WORKING PARENTS

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.443
STILL HAVE ARE ARE ABLE TO PUT

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:50.278
THEIR CHILD IN A PRESCHOOL

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.380
PROGRAM THAT ALSO PROVIDES

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.015
CHILDCARE THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.616
BUT OUR CONCERN WITH WITH MOVING

01:30:55.683 --> 01:31:00.354
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.223
HAS PROPOSED.

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:03.191
SO MAYBE IF I GIVE YOU AN

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:06.093
EXAMPLE -- I'M I'M A STUDENT SO

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.361
I NEED.

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.229
MY CHILD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.063
I'M ONLY IN CLASS IN THE MORNING

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:09.697
BUT I I NEED THE AFTERNOON TO DO

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:10.865
THE READING OF THE WRITING AND

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:12.066
GET BY.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.201
ASSIGNMENTS DONE SO I STILL

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:13.768
COULD USE FROM CHILD CARE IS

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:14.936
THAT.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:19.073
WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.608
I'M JUST GONNA DEPARTMENT OF

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:23.511
FINANCE SO THE PURPOSE BEHIND

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:25.179
ELIMINATING THE WORK REQUIREMENT

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.848
I THINK IS IS SEVERAL FOLD SO

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:29.116
FIRST IT'S DEFINITELY A PRIORITY

01:31:29.183 --> 01:31:30.651
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

01:31:30.718 --> 01:31:34.055
TO INSURE -- ACCESS TO A LONGER --

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.490
PRESCHOOL DAY -- AS WE ARE

01:31:36.557 --> 01:31:38.626
EXPANDING -- AND WORKING TOWARDS

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:39.727
THE GOAL THIS ADMINISTRATION

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.028
WHICH IS EVENTUALLY UNIVERSAL

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:43.497
PRESCHOOL -- WE FIND THAT THERE

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.266
ARE MANY DEVELOPMENTAL BENEFITS

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.634
TO A LONGER PRESCHOOL DAY I

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:48.569
THINK THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:50.137
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS. TO

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:52.740
THE EXTENT THAT -- YOU KNOW WE

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:54.508
HAVE A LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:56.043
ARE TRYING TO ACCESS THE STATE

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.211
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:59.680
IT CAN BE A BARRIER -- TO HAVE

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.182
ONLY A THREE HOUR PROGRAM FOR

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:02.583
THOSE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IF

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:03.951
TRANSPORTATION IS AN ISSUE.

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.820
SO I THINK THATONE OF OUR

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:08.322
CONCERNS IS OPENING UP -- TO OF

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.992
A FULL DAY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE --

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.327
YOU KNOW MORE ACCESS TO FAMILIES

01:32:13.394 --> 01:32:16.530
WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE.

01:32:16.597 --> 01:32:20.468
TO TO UTILIZE THESE PROGRAMS.

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:20.668
WHO?

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:22.870
CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A PROGRAM

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.272
THAT'S ONLY THREE HOURS A DAY.

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:27.208
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:27.508
[inaudible]

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.977
THAT'S WEBER.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.913
YES I I AM I APPRECIATE THE

01:32:31.979 --> 01:32:33.581
COMMENTS AND I THINK --

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.616
ELIMINATE THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRES

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.251
IS POINTING UP TO ELIMINATE SOME

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:38.886
OF THE WORK REQUIREMENTS REALLY

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:40.955
REST ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THE

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:41.756
CHILD.

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.324
MUCH MORE THAN WHAT'S BEST FOR

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.759
ALWAYS THE ADULT AND OF COURSE

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:45.726
WE FEEL A LOT OF THE NEEDS OF

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:47.261
THE ADULTS BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.262
TALK ABOUT WHAT EVERY CHILD IN

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:49.630
CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND WE'RE

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.866
PROBABLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT --

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:52.833
WORKING TOWARD A PRESCHOOL FOR

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.234
ALL.

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.568
AND AND IT WOULD NOT BE

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:55.803
CONTINGENT UPON WHETHER ANYONE

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.171
HAD A JOB WITH WHAT THE NEEDS

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.472
ARE OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE

01:32:58.539 --> 01:32:59.607
TRYING TO SERVE.

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:00.508
AND I THINK THAT BECOMES

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:02.143
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IF WE'RE

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:04.545
LOOKING AT OUR PRESCHOOL EFFORTS.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.746
I'M PLEASED THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:33:05.813 --> 01:33:07.448
AT THE IDEA THAT ANYONE WHO

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:08.382
LIVES IN THAT LOW INCOME

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:10.584
COMMUNITY ALSO HAS ACCESS TO IT

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.820
BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.355
FACED A FEW YEARS AGO WAS THAT

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.723
MANY OF US HAD EMPLOYEES WHO

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.658
WORK FOR US.

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:19.193
WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TOP HERE

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.027
WHO COULD NOT AFFORD PRESCHOOL

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.629
IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE ANNE AND

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.931
THEY WERE PEOPLE MAKING FIFTY

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:24.999
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR?

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.434
BUT WHEN YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.302
PAY A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:30.171
FOR CHILDCARE FOR PRESCHOOL

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:31.138
THAT'S IT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE SO I

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:33.374
HAVE STAFF WHO COULD NOT AFFORD.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.608
TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO DECENT

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:36.177
PRESCHOOLS AND THAT'S

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.378
UNFRTUNATE BECAUSE WE WORKING

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.879
ON ALL THE PRESCHOOL EFFORTS WE

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:39.680
COULD DO IT.

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.916
GETTING SLOTS FOR THOSE WITHOUT

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:44.185
A INCOME AND SO IF WE COULD GO

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:45.486
SO IT WAS ALMOST A DISINCENTIVE

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:47.722
FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:49.023
THEY COULDN'T FOR PRESCHOOL.

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:50.825
AND SO I THINK CHANGING THOSE

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.026
ELIGIBILITY SO THOSE WHO LIVE IN

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:53.294
THAT COMMUNITY MAKING IT

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.428
AVAILABLE TO THEM WILL IT MAKES

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:56.263
AVAILABLE TO TO ALMOST NOT

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.732
EVERYONE BUT SURELY OF A LARGE

01:33:57.798 --> 01:33:59.066
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS.

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.435
WHO WE THINK WE'RE FUNDING BUT

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.103
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT BECAUSE OF

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:02.737
THE LOWER?

01:34:02.803 --> 01:34:04.005
INCOME REQUIREMENT THAT WAS

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.639
THERE AND SO THOSE FAMILIES WHO

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.074
LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES MANY

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:09.377
OF THEM THE WORKING POOR COULD

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:10.611
NOT AFFORD TO SEND THEIR

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:11.579
CHILDREN TO A DECENT PRESCHOOL.

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.080
AND I THINK THAT IN ITSELF WAS A

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.849
TRAGEDY WITH ALL THE EFFORTS WE

01:34:14.915 --> 01:34:16.183
WERE DOING AB ONE MEMBER OF MY

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:18.185
STAFF WAS A STRONG DVOCATE THE

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:19.887
PRESCHOOL AND HE WAS AT ALL THE

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:20.821
MEETINGS AND HELPING US

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.256
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.

01:34:22.323 --> 01:34:24.492
AND SHE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE OF FOR

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.494
ANY SUPPORT TO PUT A KID THERE

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:33.734
AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO SEND A

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.569
CHILD TO DECENT PRESCHOOL.

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:36.303
THAT WAS TRAGIC INSIDE I'M

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.238
PLEASE IT WOULD LOOKING AT THIS

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:38.472
WHOLE IDEA OF THE 80% IN TERMS

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:39.473
OF BILLS IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:39.974
MAKING THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:40.908
ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:41.876
IMPORTANT.

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:44.078
SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:45.246
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THIRTY

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.213
NIELSEN I APPRECIATED YOUR

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.282
RESPONSE AND THE LOGIC I WILLING

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.551
TO ENTERTAIN SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.219
IT BUT WITH A CAUTION.

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.854
WHEN THIS CHILD CARE THING

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.356
BECAME A BIG DEAL IN THE

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.291
EIGHTIES WITH THE ADVENT OF THE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.326
GAIN PROGRAM WHICH THEN BECAME

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:01.362
CAL WORKS? ONE OF THE

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:02.430
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.731
PREMISES.

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:05.699
IT WAS THAT.

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:06.867
THE INDIVIDUAL ON THIS WOULD BE

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:09.103
THE PARENT.

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:11.405
WAS ON THE TRACK TOWARDS

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.274
IMPROVING EMPLOYABILITY IT

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:15.676
WASN'T WORK FOR IT WASN'T GET A

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:18.212
JOB IT WAS AND PROVE YOUR

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.314
WORKING SKILLS.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.183
AND I'D HATE TO SEE THAT KIND OF

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:24.852
DYNAMIC REMOVED FROM ANYTHING

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.987
THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD AND IT

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:27.621
WOULD SEEM TO ME THIS THIS MAY

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:29.857
BE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.392
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORK YOU

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.393
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.128
OBLIGATION AND I WOULD SAY NOT

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.664
JUST WORK BUT BE ATTENDING SOME

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:39.433
KIND OF UP THE SCHOOLING.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.236
OR CAREER TECH SKILLS TO DEVELOP

01:35:42.303 --> 01:35:44.705
YOUR EMPLOYABILITY THAT DOES

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:46.073
NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND.

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:48.709
AM JUST CLARIFICATION AND YOU

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:49.310
KNOW ALL NO I'M NOT GOING TO

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:50.911
THIS THE WHOLE -- CONFERENCE

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:54.381
COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS A THOUGHT

01:35:54.448 --> 01:35:57.818
MY NORMAL FROM ABOUT -- THAT'S

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:58.586
THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM TO JIM

01:35:58.652 --> 01:35:59.620
NIELSEN YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.588
HELP YOU KNOW IT IS DIRECTLY

01:36:00.654 --> 01:36:02.156
CONNECTED TO WORK REQUIREMENTS

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:04.325
JOB REQUIREMENTS IN SCHOOL --

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.227
STATE PRESCHOOL HAS A HISTORY

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:08.529
LONGER THAN THAN THE GAME

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.297
PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW THE THE

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:12.032
STATE GOT INVOLVED IN THE CHILD

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:12.967
CARE BUSINESS WHEN THE

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:14.835
GOVERNMENT ASKED WOMEN TO GO TO

01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:16.103
WORK IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:18.772
AND SO THE AP PROGRAM AND AND

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:20.040
STATE PRESCHOOL DATES BACK THERE

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:21.575
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ASKED WOMEN

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:22.643
TO GO TO WORK AND SO IT'S A

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.211
LITTLE DIFFERENT THE PROGRAM

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:24.912
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL HIT

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.013
LATER.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.781
IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHERE

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:29.717
THOSE -- HOURS IN ELIGIBILITY

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:33.420
STILL DIRECTLY LINKED TO YOUR

THERE.

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:10.951

SOURCE HERE ARE YOU WORK ARE YOU

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:20.127

THE INTENT FOR HOW THE FUNDING --

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:25.566
WOULD GO OUT -- TO TO INDIVIDUAL

GRANTEES YEAH WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.002
BOTH UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.938
THAT IT WOULD GO OUT UNDER THE

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:33.473
PRIOR RULES THE REVOLVING.

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:36.343
LOAN FUND WHICH HAS HAD LIMITED

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:37.678
SUCCESS RIGHT.

THANK YOU SO -- NO THIS IS NOT

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.816
INTENDED THAT THE ONE TIME --

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.351
FACILITIES INVESTMENTS IS NOT

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:46.420
INTENDED TO MERE -- THE EXISTING

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:49.289

APPRECIATE -- THE AT THE THOUGHT

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.930
BY THE ASSEMBLY -- TO ELIMINATE

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.732
THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND AND MOVE

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.267
THOSE FUNDS INTO THIS PROGRAM

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:01.101
I'M CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.502
CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSTRAINT

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:03.804
UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM I

01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.439
THINK THE ONLY CONCERNS WE HAVE

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.574
ABOUT -- THAT MOVING SHIFTING

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.076

IS THAT.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.448
THE THE FEASIBILITY OF IT IS A

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:15.482
LITTLE BIT QUESTIONABLE JUST

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:16.416
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE LOAN

01:44:16.483 --> 01:44:17.985
REPAYMENTS BEING MADE INTO THAT

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:20.420
PROGRAM -- AND IN ADDITION --

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:21.989
THAT PROGRAM ALSO HAS A

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:23.490
COMPONENT THAT PROVIDES NO

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:25.292
INTEREST LOANS.

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.360
FOR THINGS LIKE HEALTH AND

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:29.563
SAFETY -- RENOVATIONS AND SO

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.632

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:35.802
INTENT BEHIND -- THAT THAT MOVE

01:44:35.869 --> 01:44:37.504
AT THIS TIME OKAY.

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:25.919
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ON HOW TO

OPERATE SMALL BUSINESSES THE

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:29.356
ASSEMBLY SPECIFIES THAT STIPENDS

STATE'S QUALITY RATING SYSTEM.

PLANNING COUNCILS TO ADMINISTER-THE GRANTS ON THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:38.298 --> 01:45:39.633
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER -- THESE

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.867
FUNDS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:42.402
SPEED OF THE STATE SPENDING ON

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:43.537
OTHER WORK FIRST TRAINING

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:44.938
ACTIVITIES A STATE CURRENTLY

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:45.906
SPENDS ABOUT FIFTY MILLION

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:46.907
ANNUALLY ON PROFESSIONAL

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:48.642
DEVELOPMENT TRAINING FOR

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:50.844
PRESCHOOL -- CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:53.580
PROVIDERS. ONE QUESTION I HAD A

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:54.915
THE ADMINISTRATION -- IT IT

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:57.951
APPEARS TO US THAT THE LANGUAGE --

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:58.785
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:00.087
LEGISLATURE PLAYED LEGISLATURE

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:02.589
HAS AN OVERSIGHT ROLE WITH

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:03.623
REGARD TO HOW THE FUNDS ARE

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:07.227
SPENT -- AND AND REALLY LIMITS

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:08.729
OUR ENGAGEMENT.

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:11.498
A IS THERE A CONCERN WITH THE

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:13.433
APPROACH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.801
HAVE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO OUR

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:16.770
ENGAGEMENT.

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.171
SAID THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:19.806
IT IS SUPPOSED TO THAT LANGUAGE --

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:22.409
MAINLY BECAUSE THE MASTER PLAN

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:23.710
FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE WE

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:25.212
REALLY WANT THAT TO BE A KEY

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:26.713
VEHICLES TO INCORPORATE SOME OF

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.448
THESE LONG RANGE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:29.716
AND SO WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:46:29.783 --> 01:46:32.052
LACK OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:32.652
WOULD HAVE IF THAT LANGUAGE IS

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.121
ADOPTED.

01:46:34.187 --> 01:46:35.789
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:37.290
I SHOULD POINT OUT ALSO ON A

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:38.492
SEPARATE ISSUE THAT THE

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:39.626
ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THE

01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.528
SENATE CLARIFICATION TO SUPPORT

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:42.996
A BROADER RANGE OF PROVIDERS AND

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:44.131
LEARNING NEEDS -- INCLUDING IN

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.766
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS SO

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.267
ON THAT SPECIFIC ITEM THE

01:46:47.334 --> 01:46:49.669
ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THAT

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.037
THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION.

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:54.241
WHAT'S YOUR TIME FRAME -- AROUND

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:57.778
THIS YET ONE MORE ENGAGEMENT AND

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:59.479
STUDY ABOUT THE EARLY CARE AND

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:01.748
EDUCATION SYSTEM I THINK I'VE

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.483
LIVED THROUGH ADULT I'VE LOST

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:06.153
COUNT -- AND IT'S WHAT YOUR TIME

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:08.522
FRAME IN TERMS TO YOUR

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:10.023
EXPECTATIONS WHEN DEAL.

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:11.358
HAVE A CLEAR DIRECTION AND A

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:13.460
ROADMAP YES SO -- WE KNOW THAT

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:15.829
THERE IS -- A PROPOSAL FOR MONEY

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:17.631
IN THE BUDGET -- FOR TO FUND

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:19.299
THIS MASTER PLAN AND SO ASSUMING

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:20.834
THAT THAT GOES FORWARD -- RIGHT

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.269
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS AIMING

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:24.037
FOR NEXT YEAR FALL -- TO REALLY

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:26.273
DO A ROBUST EFFORT AND LOOK AT

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:28.275
ALL OF THIS AND THE REPORT READY

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:29.709
BY NEXT FALL AND I SHOULD.

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.344
EMPHASIZE THAT WE KNOW THAT

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.212
THERE ARE A LOT OF PRIORITIES

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.313
AND IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.781
EVERY ISSUE BEING A PRIORITY BUT

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.349
FOR THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THE

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.818
CHIEF OF STAFF AND LERI THIS IS

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:39.519
REALLY HER LIFE'S WORK AND SO

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:41.054
THIS WILL BE A PRIORITY OF THE

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:41.454
MINISTRY.

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:42.856
AND I WOULD JUST PASS OF THE TWO

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:45.225
OF THEM THAT THAT WE NOT START

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.560
FROM GROUND.

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.295
ZERO THAT THERE HAS BEEN YEARS

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:52.365
OF WORK IN TERMS OF SIMILAR

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:55.168
EFFORTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:57.070
BOTTOM OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:59.206
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SO THAT

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:00.373
WE NOT START AS IF WE HAVE A

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:01.775
CLEAN SLATE BECAUSE WE REALLY

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:02.008
DON'T.

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.176
AND SO I HOPE THE BLUE RIBBON

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:04.444
COMMISSION FROM THE ASSEMBLY

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.245
FROM JUST LAST YEAR AND AND

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.813
OTHER SIMILAR EFFORTS WILL BE

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.148
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YES I DON'T

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:11.184
EXPECT TO POINTS ON THAT NUMBER --

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:11.952
ONE IN SPECIFICALLY THE BLUE

01:48:12.018 --> 01:48:12.986
RIBBON COMMISSION WE ARE VERY

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.521
GRATEFUL FOR THE PREVIOUS

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:16.389
EFFORTS OF CALM AND FOLKS ARE

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:17.757
READING THEM AND LOOKING INTO

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:18.391
THEM AND SO THAT WILL PROVIDE A

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:19.459
BIG BASS FOR WHAT THE

01:48:19.526 --> 01:48:20.760
ADMINISTRATION.

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:21.828
DIES -- AND THEN THE SECOND

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:22.929
THING IS I KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:48:22.996 --> 01:48:24.698
CONVERSATION AROUND HERE WHETHER

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.066
IT WAS FOR THESE AFTER SCHOOL

01:48:26.132 --> 01:48:27.634
SLOTS WHETHER WAS RELEASED

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.768
PRESCHOOL SLOTS.

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:29.936
IS AROUND FUNDING AND WE KNOW

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:31.304
IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFICULT

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:32.606
CONVERSATION TO HAVE IN TERMS OF

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:33.773
WHERE NEW REVENUE MAY COME FROM

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.609
BUT THAT IS WITHIN THE PURVIEW

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:36.943
OF THE PROPOSED MASTER PLAN FOR

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.245
EARLY LEARNING AND CARE THAT THE

01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:39.145
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PUT

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:39.713
TOGETHER.

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.615
EXCELLENT WE APPRECIATE THE

01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.383
PRIORITIZATION THE FOCUS

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:51.958
ATTENTION MOVIE NOT DOCTOR WEBER.

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:54.294
NEXT YEAR -- ONE OF THE

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:56.029
CHALLENGES I I SEE HERE -- THAT

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:57.464
THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE IN THE

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.698
LANGUAGE THEY FOCUS ON ENGLISH

01:48:58.765 --> 01:49:01.301
AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AS AS A AS

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:02.535
A AB. ONE OF THE SERVER

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:03.603
POPULATIONS WHERE ENGLISH AS A

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:04.738
SECOND LANGUAGE AND YET WE KNOW.

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:05.872
THAT THAT ITSELF IS SOMEWHAT

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:07.007
NERO BECAUSE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:08.341
IS A MUCH BROADER CHALLENGE OF

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:09.342
FOR THESE COMMUNITIES AND ALL

01:49:09.409 --> 01:49:10.777
AND OFTENTIMES THOSE ARE THOSE

01:49:10.844 --> 01:49:12.445
CHILDREN END UP ENTERING.

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:15.215
OF SCHOOL WITH A LOW ENGLISH

01:49:15.282 --> 01:49:17.250
PROFICIENCY -- WHO ARE ENGLISH

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:18.551
WHO SPEAK ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:19.819
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ENGLISH IN

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:25.492
TERMS OF VOCABULARY -- BUT

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:26.993
CHALLENGE SO THAT WHEN WE LOOK

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.828
AT LATER ON I'M LOOKING AT

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:30.597
TESTING AND REFINING THAT.

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:32.132
KIDS IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AS

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:34.935
OUR SCHOOLING SO LOW IN ENGLISH --

01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:36.369
AND LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S MAINLY

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:38.438
BE ENGLISH PROFICIENCY MUCH MORE

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:39.406
THAN ENGLISH AS A SECOND

01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:42.008
LANGUAGE AND SO I I THINK WE

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.276
HAVE TO BROADEN OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:44.244
OR AT LEAST ENHANCE OUR

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:46.212
PERSPECTIVE WITH REGARDS TO WHAT

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:47.681
WE'RE DOING IN PRESCHOOL.

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:49.716
AND CHILDCARE BECAUSE MANY FOLKS

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:50.183
WHO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:52.018
PROFICIENCY -- SO THAT THOSE

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:53.620
CHILDREN WHO ARE WHOSE PARENTS

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:54.988
MAY SPEAK ENGLISH BUT DON'T

01:49:55.055 --> 01:49:57.090
SPEAK IT IN A MANNER THAT ALLOWS

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.158
THE STUDENTS TO BE PROFICIENT IN

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:58.491
IT.

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:00.427
ARE OFTEN IGNORED IN TERMS OF

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:02.028
THEIR LIVES THE EFFORTS TO

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.063
IMPROVE THEIR THEIR ENGLISH

01:50:03.129 --> 01:50:05.498
LANGUAGE -- AND AS A RESULT THE

01:50:05.565 --> 01:50:07.634
END UP WITH LOWER VOCABULARY

01:50:07.701 --> 01:50:08.601
DOING VERY POORLY AT THE

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:09.836
BEGINNING AND SEEM TO NEVER

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:12.172
CATCH UP AS WE'RE FINDING WITH

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:13.907
OUR LCF DATA SO.

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:14.841
WE CAN ACTUALLY BE PUSHING THIS

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.509
ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IN YET EVERY

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:17.510
TIME I TURN AROUND LENDS IT

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:19.512
COMES IN SECOND LANGUAGE SECOND

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:20.347
LANGUAGE READ ENGLISH

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.115
PROFICIENCY WHICH COVERS MORE

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:23.950
THAN JUST SECOND LANGUAGE.

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:25.819
AND INCLUDING COMPASSES EIGHT A

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:27.454
HUGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.855
PARTICULAR POOR CHILDREN.

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:29.923
A MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:31.725
WERE IN GREAT NEED OF ENGLISH

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:33.593
PROFICIENCY.

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.462
EARLY ON SO THAT THEY THEY

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:38.198
DEVELOP EIGHT EIGHT AM. EIGHT

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.099
EIGHT A USE OF THE ENGLISH

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:40.433
LANGUAGE THAT THE END IS THE USE

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.801
OF KNOWLEDGE REALLY THE LANGUAGE

01:50:41.868 --> 01:50:43.636
OF KNOWLEDGE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:44.704
THEN DO EXTREMELY WELL SO I

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.806
WOULD URGE EVERYONE TO LOOK AT

01:50:46.873 --> 01:50:47.774
THE SECOND LANGUAGE.

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:49.609
CONCEPT AND BASICALLY MOVE

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:51.044
OURSELVES TO ENGLISH PROFICIENCY

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:54.814
WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER CONCEPT

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.483
STUDY AT UCLA.

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:57.217
THAT SHOW THAT LA VETTING

01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:59.386
SUFFICIENCY IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE

01:50:59.452 --> 01:51:01.087
AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:02.188
THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.923
STARTED BECAUSE THEN.

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.824
YOU COULD MOVE ON TO ADD THAT

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.092
WHEN THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN AND

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:14.367
THEY'RE MUCH BETTER OFF IN A

01:51:14.434 --> 01:51:15.969
MUCH FURTHER HIT.

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.037
AND SEVEN MINISTRATION

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:17.670
DEFINITELY WANTS TO WORK WITH A

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:18.238
NOTE THE SENATE LANGUAGE AND

01:51:18.304 --> 01:51:18.838
WORK WITH ALL THE ON THAT AND

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:19.139
ONE POINT.

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:19.706
I SHOULD MAKE ABOUT THIS IS

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:20.907
BECAUSE THIS IS FOR TRAINING

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:21.808
SPECIFICALLY SO DIFFERENT FROM

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:23.009
SOME THE FORMULAS WE SEE FOR THE

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:23.543
HOUSE YET THAT FOR EXAMPLE

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:24.411
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:25.578
COULD FOR TRAINING ACCOMPLISH

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:26.946
BOTH OF THOSE PURPOSES RIGHT AND

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.281
AND AND AND AND AND I THINK

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:28.581
THAT'S TRUE.

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:29.949
BU AND BUT IT HAS TO BE IN THE

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.351
IN THE LANGUAGE HERE.

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:33.753
IN ORDER FOR IT TO EVER GET TO

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.555

DIMINISHED PROFICIENCY.

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:50.904

IT'S ACTUALLY ONE TIME OVER FIVE

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:37.383
YEARS SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE PIECE

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.285
OF IT -- I THINK THE OTHER

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:41.688
PIECES THIS IS A CONVERSATION

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.623
THAT I THINK HAS BEEN ONGOING

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:44.757
FOR MORE YEARS THAN I'VE BEEN ON

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:45.825
THIS ASSIGNMENT.

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.360
ABOUT HOW WE IMPROVE OVERALL

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:50.163
QUALITY -- AND PROFESSIONAL EYES

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:51.664
ARE CHILD CARE WORK FORCE.

01:52:51.731 --> 01:52:53.600
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:52:53.666 --> 01:52:55.568
BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION -- AT

01:52:55.635 --> 01:52:58.138
POINTED OUT IN ITS IN ITS --

01:52:58.204 --> 01:53:00.807
REPORT AS WELL AS A SENATOR

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:01.841
MITCHELL POINTED OUT THAT THERE

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.343
ARE MANY OTHER REPORTS INCLUDING

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:05.478
OUR STATE ADVISORY COUNCIL HAS --

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:07.313
HAS REPORTS ON THIS ON THEIR

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.548
MANY NONPROFIT SAID REPORTS ON

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:12.218
THIS -- THAT OUR OUR CHILD CARE

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:13.853
IT NEEDS TO ALSO BE

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.722
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE --

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:19.025
AND LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.460
SHOULD WE INCREASE OUR

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.629
REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLKS TO DO

01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:23.963
PROVIDE THIS CARE.

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:25.431
AND I THINK THAT WE SEE THIS AS

01:53:25.498 --> 01:53:26.900
PART OF A LARGER CONVERSATION

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:28.501
AROUND THE ENTIRE CHILD CARE

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.769
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:30.970
LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THAT YOU

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:31.638
ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE

01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:33.573
RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.075
HOW YOU ARE -- PROVIDING AT A

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.644
SALARY FOR THE FOLKS WHO HAVE

01:53:37.710 --> 01:53:39.946
THIS HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL --

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:41.281
AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT

01:53:41.347 --> 01:53:43.082
FIT INTO THE SCHOOL READING THIS

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:44.484
CONVERSATION AND HOW YOU

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:45.952
INCREASE ACCESS TO THE TARGETED

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:47.720
WAY THAT REALLY PROVIDES THE

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:48.321
GREATEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT FOR

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:49.022
STUDENTS.

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:53.826
SO THE VISION IS THAT THIS IS A

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:54.928
PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER --

01:53:54.994 --> 01:53:55.762
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW OUR

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:56.462
CURRENT HEALTHCARE

01:53:56.529 --> 01:53:57.764
INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS I THINK IS

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.699
WHY IT'S SO MPORTANT FOR US TO

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:00.667
AS ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE IN

01:54:00.733 --> 01:54:02.869
THAT -- IMPORTANT MASTER PLAN

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:05.171
PLANNING PROCESS BECAUSE WE TALK

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:06.439
ALL THE TIME AND AND THE CHILD

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:08.041
CARE WORLD ABOUT THE THREE LIKE

01:54:08.107 --> 01:54:09.008
IT'S STILL CHILD CARE YOU KNOW

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:09.442
SLOTS.

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:12.278
ARE ACCESS RATES IN QUALITY.

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:14.047
AND I THINK THAT -- IN OUR

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.215
CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE WE KIND

01:54:15.281 --> 01:54:16.249
OF HAD SOME VERY YEARS WITHOUT

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:17.383
AND SO WE WANT TO BE REALLY

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.085
CAREFUL AND STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:19.586
WE MAKE.

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:20.620
INVESTMENTS MOVING INTO THE

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:21.721
FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

BRINGING UP ALL OF THOSE ALL

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:24.490
THOSE BUCKETS ARE RISING IN A

01:54:24.557 --> 01:54:26.893
WAY THAT IS ALSO A FISCALLY

01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:28.027

LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:45.785
FIRST THE TWO HOUSES TARGET THE

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:47.153
GRANTS RATHER DIFFERENTLY.

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:48.287
THE SENATE TARGETS THE GRANT

SPECIFICALLY TO LOW INCOME

02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:51.557

AND ELIGIBILITY RULES IN THE

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:14.480
SENATE PLAN MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:16.115
WITH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:16.682
INTEREST IN THESE FACILITY

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:18.384
GRANTS WHICH WAS BASED ON A

02:04:18.450 --> 02:04:19.919
RECENT SURVEY THAT WE SENT TO

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:24.857
LOW INCOME DISTRICTS CURRENTLY

02:04:24.924 --> 02:04:25.424

THIRD THE SENATE PURPLES

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:29.195
PROPOSAL IS COORDINATED WITH THE

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:30.529
STATE'S MAIN SCHOOL FACILITY

UNDER THE SENATE PLAN AT NEW

02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:34.333
CLASSROOMS BUILT UNDER THESE

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:34.967
THREE THESE GRANTS WOULD FACTOR

02:04:35.034 --> 02:04:36.602
INTO DISTRICTS ELIGIBILITY --

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.070
FOR OTHERS STATE FUNDING FOR

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:39.705
SCHOOL FACILITIES IN CONTRAST

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.373
THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WOULD NOT

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.675
FACTOR IN ANY OF THESE NEW

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:44.610
CLASSROOMS INTO DISTRICTS

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:46.178
ELIGIBILITY.

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:47.780
LASTLY WE KNOW THAT THIS FAMILY

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:49.381
ADOPTS A BROADER ELIGIBILITY

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:51.250
RULES BY ALL ONLY PROVIDES FIFTY

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:53.018
MILLION MORE THAN THE SENATE WE

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:54.453
BELIEVE THIS MAY RESULT IN THE

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:56.121
ASSEMBLY PLAN BEING OVER

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:56.989
SUSPECTS SUBSCRIBED.

ASSEMBLY IS APPROACH WE

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:01.160
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER HOW

02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:01.994
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRIORITIZE

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:04.830
FUNDING MIKE'S POTENTIAL

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:05.130
APPLICANTS.

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:10.369
THANK YOU. THREE MORE LOT.

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:12.004
MADAM CHAIR I'M WONDERING IF I

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:15.207
COULD ASK SENATOR REID QUESTION.

02:05:15.274 --> 02:05:16.809
OF COURSE YOU MAY THIRD A RAW

02:05:16.876 --> 02:05:19.245
FOOD ARE YOU OPEN TO RECEIVING A

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:20.646
QUESTION.

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:23.749
CERTAINLY OPEN TO THE LOWER PART

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:25.818
OF THE ANSWER.

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.019
YOU'RE THE CHAIR OF SUB ONE AND

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:27.353
SO.

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:28.354
THE GOVERNOR WANTS SIX HUNDRED

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:28.921
MILLION AND YOU'RE SAYING A

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:29.722
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:30.923
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.258
HOW THAT DISCUSSION WENT TEN WHY

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:33.592
YOU'RE WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:39.798
THE GOVERNOR?

02:05:39.865 --> 02:05:42.401
A LOADED QUESTION.

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:44.270
A LOADED QUESTION.

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:47.239
I THINK I CAN WIN AND THAT IF

02:05:47.306 --> 02:06:04.123
YOU DON'T NO NO NO NO I ONE MORE

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:06.458
EXPERIENCE CALLING FROM THE

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:12.331
ASSEMBLY MY LA ON AND GO OVER TO

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:19.538
THE SURE IF I MAY UM OUR

02:06:19.605 --> 02:06:20.506
ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED

02:06:20.572 --> 02:06:22.942
MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE

02:06:23.008 --> 02:06:24.276
ADMINISTRATION.

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:25.778
WE SURVEYED -- DISTRICTS ARE LOW

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:26.879
INCOME AND PROVIDING PARTY

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:28.314
KINDERGARTEN TO SEE IF THERE WAS

02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.214
INTEREST IN THESE GRANTS AND OUR

02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:30.215
RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS NOT

02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:31.216
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:06:31.283 --> 02:06:32.017
WORTH OF INTEREST AND SO.

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.152
THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY BOTH

02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:33.786
DECREASE THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:36.588
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE THINK

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:37.089
THAT MOVES IN THE RIGHT

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.724
DIRECTION.

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:39.959
DOES THAT.

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:41.727
IN AMERICA THAT'S GREAT SO MR

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:42.895
Và SPOTIFY UNDEAD.

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:44.697
DO YOU WANT TO REBUT.

02:06:44.763 --> 02:06:45.597
YES SIR THE THE FIRST THING I'LL

02:06:45.664 --> 02:06:46.265
SAY IS AND IT IS TRUE FOR ALL OF

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:46.932
US BUT FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN IS

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:48.100
A REAL PRIORITY FOR THIS

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:48.834
ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW WITH

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:49.902
SO MUCH DO FOR PRESCHOOL AND

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:50.936
CHILDCARE BUT IF MOVING UP THE

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:52.972
WAGE LADDER -- FOLKS WHO REALLY

02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:53.806
DO WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:54.406
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN DO NOT

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.207
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WE THINK

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:56.375
THAT'S A REAL ISSUE SO THAT'S

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:58.711
WHY WE PUT IN. SIX HUNDRED NINE

02:06:58.777 --> 02:06:59.345
DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION --

02:06:59.411 --> 02:07:00.379
WHEN IT SPECIFICALLY COMES TO

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:01.380
DEMAND THE TRUTH IS YOU KNOW

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.315
WE'RE ALL FOR CASTING WE DON'T

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:04.516
KNOW WHAT TO MANDATE WILL BELIKE?

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:06.852
BUT IF MORE THAN HALF FOR

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:08.754
EXAMPLE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:11.290
CURRENTLY HAS PARTAKEN REGARDING

02:07:11.357 --> 02:07:12.024
DO APPLY FOR FULL DAY

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:13.792
KINDERGARTEN WE ANTICIPATE THAT

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:16.161
THAT BY ITSELF WILL EXCEED THE

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.096
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:19.098
THAT WE'VE MADE AVAILABLE AND IF

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:21.066
IT TURNS OUT THE DEMAND IS LOWER

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:23.002
THAN WE FORECASTED OBVIOUSLY

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:24.470
THAT MONEY DOES NOT GO AWAY IT

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:25.270
GETS SWEPT BACK RIGHT INTO THE

02:07:25.337 --> 02:07:26.839
BUDGET CAN BE USED FOR OTHER

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:27.873
PURPOSES WHETHER FOR EARLY

02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:28.507
MORNING.

02:07:28.574 --> 02:07:30.476
OR OTHERS AND I'LL MAKE ONE

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:34.980
POINT ALSO ON WHEN IT COMES TO

02:07:35.047 --> 02:07:36.248
LOW INCOME.

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:36.982
SCHOOLS VERSUS OTHER SCHOOLS SO

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:37.649
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT NEEDS TO

02:07:37.716 --> 02:07:38.617
BE A PRIORITY AND IT IS A

02:07:38.684 --> 02:07:40.352
PRIORITY IN OUR PROPOSAL AT THE

02:07:40.419 --> 02:07:42.821
SAME TIME -- OR FOCUS REALLY IS

02:07:42.888 --> 02:07:44.890
ON CONVERTING PART DAY TO FULL

02:07:44.957 --> 02:07:46.091
DAY US BUSINESS ESPECIALLY FOR

02:07:46.158 --> 02:07:47.259
THE FIRST YEAR THE PROGRAM

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:48.727
ACROSS ALL SCHOOL SO WHAT WE

02:07:48.794 --> 02:07:49.928
WANT TO PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:51.563
SCHOOLS WE THINK THAT OTHER

02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:52.998
SCHOOLS THAT MAY NOT FIT

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:54.433
SPECIFICALLY WITH THAT WITHIN

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:55.667
THAT INCOME BRACKETS.

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:56.668
BUT WE'RE QUE -- PARENTS ALSO DO

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:57.870
NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.004
THEIR KIDS TO A FULL DAY

02:07:59.071 --> 02:08:00.773
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SHOULD BE

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.975
ABLE TO APPLY FOR STATE FUNDING

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.810
AS WELL.

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:05.544
SO.

02:08:05.611 --> 02:08:06.712
A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:08.047
FINDING IT'S DIFFERENT.

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:08.781
THIS YEAR FROM PRIOR YEARS IS

02:08:08.847 --> 02:08:10.215
THAT.

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:12.017
GOVERNOR BROWN WOULD ISSUE A

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:15.154
BUDGET AND YOU KNOW IT IS.

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:16.688
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THE

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.023
LEGISLATURE WOULD PUSH HIM A

02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:19.491
LITTLE FURTHER OUT SAY WANT TO

02:08:19.558 --> 02:08:21.827
SPEND MORE.

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.629
AND YOUR BOSS IS SORT OF GONE

02:08:23.695 --> 02:08:24.863
WAY OUT AND I'M KIND OF THINKING

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:25.964
WHO PUSHES.

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:27.232
BACK.

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.934
IN SO I SEE THIS IS MAYBE ONE OF

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:31.703
THOSE EXAMPLES OF SAYING WE'RE

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:32.304
GOING TO PUSH IT BACK A LITTLE

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:33.238
BIT.

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:34.873
AND SO I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN IT

02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.442
OCCURS AND WE'LL FIND OUT AS WE

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:37.643
GO THROUGH.

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:39.745
THIS PROCESS BUT I FIND IT

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:42.514
ENCOURAGING THAT IS THE THE I

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:44.149
MEAN THE VIRUS SENATOR ROBB I

02:08:44.216 --> 02:08:45.684
JUST THOUGHT.

02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:47.820
I WOULD GIVE THEM AN ATTA BOY.

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:48.487
PERCENT OKAY THIS IS GREAT WE'VE

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:49.955
GOT SOME HONEST DEBATE AND IT

02:08:50.022 --> 02:08:51.590
ISN'T JUST GOING TO BE.

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:53.892
THE MAX AMOUNT SO I APPRECIATE

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.461
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ANSWER THOSE

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.162
QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM.

WANNA ADD TO CENTS SURE WELL TO

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:01.967
BE HONEST IT'S NOT LIKE WE TOOK

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:02.901
THE DIFFERENCE AND PUT IT IN THE

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:04.536
RESERVE WHICH YOU PROBABLY WOULD

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.972
HAVE LIKELY RE PRIORITIZE IT.

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:08.640
FOR OTHER EARLY LEARNING

02:09:08.707 --> 02:09:09.942
PRIORITIES BUT I THINK MISTER

02:09:10.008 --> 02:09:11.143
TEEING MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:12.111
WHILE AGO.

02:09:12.177 --> 02:09:17.616
THERE'S BEEN TWO REPORTS NOW.

02:09:17.683 --> 02:09:18.617
THAT TALKED ABOUT WHILE FULL DAY

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:20.953
KINDERGARTEN IS IS A GREAT

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:22.121
QUESTION WE SHOULD BE DOING IT.

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:23.889
WE STARTED LAST YEAR AND JUST

02:09:23.956 --> 02:09:25.891
pTHAT AND THE DEMAND WASN'T THERE

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.459
WITH THE WITH THE AMOUNTS THAT

02:09:27.526 --> 02:09:29.161
WAS APPROPRIATE LAST YEAR NOR

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:30.562
THIS YAR'S SO.

02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:31.763
THAT WE THINK IT WAS JUST AN

02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.832
APPROPRIATE LOWERING THE AMOUNT

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:35.400
TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE REAL NEEDS

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:37.703
ARE -- THE ASSEMBLY ONCE A

02:09:37.769 --> 02:09:38.871
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:40.973
FOCUS NOT JUST ON KINDERGARTEN

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:43.208
FACILITIES BUT PRE K. FACILITIES

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:45.144
AS WELL WE WE HAVE HEARD FROM

02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:47.179
THE OTHER -- ISSUE WE HEARD FROM

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:48.380
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:49.781
THESE PROGRAMS ARE THREE LEGGED

02:09:49.848 --> 02:09:52.317
STOOL THERE'S THERE'S LOTS AND

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:53.919
RATES AND QUALITY.

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:57.055
AND THE THAT THE FACILITIES ON

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:58.624
THE RATES PEAS ARE GO HAND IN

02:09:58.690 --> 02:10:00.325
HAND SO IF YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.961
THE FACILITIES YOU SOMETIMES

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.630
HAVE TO TURN BACK MONEY AND SO.

02:10:04.696 --> 02:10:06.298
MAKING SOME OF THESE -- SCHOOL

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:07.933
SITES AND DID NOT JUST FULL DAY

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.568
KINDERGARTEN BUT FULL DAY

02:10:09.635 --> 02:10:15.107
PRESCHOOL -- PROGRAMS WOULD ALSO

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:15.707
BE A GOOD USE OF THAT ONE TIME

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:17.509
MONEY.

02:10:17.576 --> 02:10:18.243
PAYMENT YOU'RE JUST TO TRY TO

FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:21.480
QUESTION -- YOU KNOW BUDGETING

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:23.315
IS A BALANCING A PRIORITIES IN

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:25.217

02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:31.924
VERSUS.

THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MENTAL

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:35.727
HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS.

OPERATIONS AND SO.

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:44.002
THE MONEY THAT WE DID REMOVE

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:45.103
FROM THIS PARTICULAR LINE ITEM

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.505

FOUR OF YOUR ANALYSIS.

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:54.213
WAS MOVED INTO THE SENATE'S

02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:10.395

02:11:16.902 --> 02:11:20.072
KAHUNA.

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:22.574

SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:34.186
THANK YOU.

02:11:34.253 --> 02:11:35.821
I THINK YOU KIND OF COUPON WITH

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:37.456
THE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:38.523
SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT'S

02:11:38.590 --> 02:11:39.625
IN YOUR BINDERS OVERVIEW OF

02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:40.892
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT K.

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.628
TWELVE ISSUES.

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:43.495
STARTING WITH PAGE ONE OF THAT

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:45.197
HANDLE BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:46.832
SMALLEY REVENUE PACKAGES FROM

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:47.599
THE GOVERNOR.

02:11:47.666 --> 02:11:49.101
OF THOSE REVENUES LOWER REVENUES

02:11:49.167 --> 02:11:51.603
TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:52.471
YOUR WITH THE STATE IS REQUIRED

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:53.739
TO ALLOCATE TO SCHOOLS AND

02:11:53.805 --> 02:11:56.008
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO MEET THE

02:11:56.074 --> 02:11:56.541
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:58.043
GUARANTEE -- BUT RATHER THAN

02:11:58.110 --> 02:11:59.711
REDUCE FUNDING TO THAT MINIMUM

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:01.446
LEVEL BOTH HOUSES UP TO PROVIDE

02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:03.448
THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS THE

02:12:03.515 --> 02:12:04.182
GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE MAY

02:12:04.249 --> 02:12:04.983
REVISION.

02:12:05.050 --> 02:12:06.518
UNDER ALL THREE PLANS TOTAL

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:07.819
GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL PROPERTY

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:09.254
TAX REVENUE FOR SCHOOLS AND

02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.322
COLLEGES.

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.291
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY

02:12:12.357 --> 02:12:13.992
IS EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:15.460
AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT NINE

02:12:15.527 --> 02:12:18.597
BILLION OVER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:20.065
LEVEL.

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:20.699
BY TURNING TO PAGE TWO ALTHOUGH

02:12:20.766 --> 02:12:22.034
THE PLANS ALL HAVE THE SAME

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:24.102
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THEY DIFFER IN

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:25.270
A COUPLE KEY WAY IS.

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:26.805
A FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN

02:12:26.872 --> 02:12:28.473
INCLUDES -- DEPOSIT INTO THE

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.608
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SCHOOL

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.876
RESERVE OF THREE HUNDRED AND

02:12:30.942 --> 02:12:32.644
EIGHTY NINE MILLION THAT'S THE

02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:34.680
LARGEST OF THE THREE PLANS --

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:35.981
THE SENATE DEPOSITS NINETY

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:38.250
MILLION AND THE ASSEMBLY HAS NO

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:39.151
DEPOSIT.

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:40.585
OUT THE LOWER DEPOSITS UNDER THE

02:12:40.652 --> 02:12:42.254
TWO HOUSES PLAN I PRIMARILY

02:12:42.321 --> 02:12:45.357
BECAUSE THE HOUSES HAVE THOSE

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.858
SMALLER REVENUE PACKAGES.

02:12:46.925 --> 02:12:47.459
THE PLANS ALSO MAKE DIFFERENT

02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:49.428
CHOICES ABOUT THE MIX OF ONE

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:50.529
TIME AND I'M GOING SPENDING.

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:52.564
THE SENATE PLAN SPENDS ABOUT A

02:12:52.631 --> 02:12:53.999
HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION LESS

02:12:54.066 --> 02:12:55.600
ON ON GOING PROGRAMS THAT HAS

02:12:55.667 --> 02:12:56.501
AVAILABLE AND I'M GOING

02:12:56.568 --> 02:12:57.669
RESOURCES.

02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.338
SO THAT GIVES THE PLAN A SMALL

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:01.773
OPERATING SURPLUS MOVING FORWARD.

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:02.974
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS FAIRLY

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:04.710
CLOSE TO THE SENATE AS FAR AS

02:13:04.776 --> 02:13:05.644
THAT MIX.

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:06.912
BY THE ASSEMBLY PLANTS SPENDS

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.347
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION MORE

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.915
AN ON GOING PROGRAMS THAN IT HAS

02:13:09.981 --> 02:13:12.851
AVAILABLE IN ONGOING RESOURCES

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:13.585
AND SO THAT CREATES A SMALL

02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:16.488
DEFICIT MOVING INTO NEXT YEAR'S

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:17.289
BUDGET CYCLE.

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:20.058
UNDER ANY OF THE THREE PLANS.

02:13:20.125 --> 02:13:21.760
BOB RATHER SMALL BUDGET CUSHION

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.228
A MUCH SMALLER THAN YOU HAD IN

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:25.364
PREVIOUS YEARS AND THAT'S

02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:27.265
IMPORTANT TO YOU BECAUSE WHEN

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:28.233
YOU HAVE THAT SMALLER CHRISTIAN

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:29.468
ONGOING PROGRAMS AND MORE

02:13:29.534 --> 02:13:31.169
VULNERABLE TO REDUCTIONS THAT

02:13:31.236 --> 02:13:32.537
MIGHT HAPPEN.

02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:33.171
DURING THE NEXT ECONOMIC

02:13:33.238 --> 02:13:35.107
DOWNTURN SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.408
CONSIDER BUILDING A LARGER

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:37.843
BUDGET QUESTION I YOU COULD DO

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.444
THAT BY MAKING ELECTED DEPOSIT

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:41.380
INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:13:41.446 --> 02:13:42.114
EIGHT SCHOOL RESERVE.

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:46.151
OR ALLOCATING MORE PROPOSITION

02:13:46.218 --> 02:13:46.718
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR ONE

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:47.786
TIME ACTIVITIES.

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:49.888
FINALLY THE ASSEMBLY -- BUT NOT

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:51.089
THE GOVERNOR THE SENATE UP TO

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:51.923
EIGHTEEN SOMETHING KNOWN AS THE

02:13:51.990 --> 02:13:53.191
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TRIP

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.226
ACCOUNT.

02:13:54.292 --> 02:13:55.660
THIS IS A MECHANISM THE STATE

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:57.662
CREATED LAST YEAR TO ADJUST

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.030
SCHOOL FUNDING AND RESPONSES IN

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:00.599
RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:01.733
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.168
GUARANTEED THAT HAPPENED ONCE

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:04.035
THE YEAR IS OVER.

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:05.270
WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY

02:14:05.337 --> 02:14:07.239
SECTION BECAUSE WE THINK THE

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:08.306
TRIP ACCOUNT WITH SOME STEPS

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:10.909
WITHOUT FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS OVER

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.377
TIME.

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:13.745
I TURNING TO PAGE THREE ON SOME

02:14:13.812 --> 02:14:14.546
OF THE SPECIFIC K. TWELVE

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:15.480
PROPOSALS THE LARGEST

02:14:15.547 --> 02:14:16.148
AUGMENTATION UNDER ALL THREE

02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:17.916
PLANS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL

02:14:17.983 --> 02:14:19.718
FUNDING FORMULA.

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:20.952
GOVERNOR IN THE SENATE EACH

02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:21.820
PROVIDE TWO BILLION TO FUND THE

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:23.488
STATUTORY COST OF LIVING

02:14:23.555 --> 02:14:24.322
ADJUSTMENT.

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:25.857
THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES AN

02:14:25.924 --> 02:14:26.591
ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:27.859
SEVENTY MILLION ON TOP OF THAT

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:31.129
AMOUNT WE THINK THE EMPHASIS ON

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:32.631
ON L. CFF UNDER ALL THREE PLANS

02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:33.498
MAKE SENSE.

02:14:33.565 --> 02:14:34.833
THAT'S GOING TO GIVE SCHOOLS A

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:35.700
LITTLE BIT MORE ABILITY TO

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:37.102
PURSUE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS

02:14:37.169 --> 02:14:41.473
AND FLEXIBLE IN STRATEGIC WAYS.

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:42.841
THE NEXT LARGEST ITEM A SPECIAL

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:43.141
EDUCATION.

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:43.909
BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:45.210
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:47.012
NEW SIX HUNDRED NINETY SIX

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.246
MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM.

02:14:48.313 --> 02:14:50.282
INSTEAD THE HOUSES UP TO

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:51.450
EQUALIZE EXISTING SPECIAL

02:14:51.516 --> 02:14:53.084
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES

02:14:53.151 --> 02:14:54.553
AND TO PROVIDE NEW ONGOING

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.621
FUNDING. FOR PRESCHOOL AGE

02:14:56.688 --> 02:14:58.657
CHILDREN WHO HAVE DISABILITIES.

02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:00.659
WE THINK THE HOUSES TAKE A MUCH

02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:01.626
MORE PROMISING APPROACH FROM THE

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:03.295
GOVERNOR AND WE RECOMMEND YOU

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:04.896
MAINTAIN -- HOUSES APPROACH IN

02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:07.399
YOUR FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE.

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:08.700
THERE ARE TWO OTHER NOTABLE

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:11.069
DIFFERENCES THE SENATE HAS TWO

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:12.003
HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:13.738
ONE TIME TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES

02:15:13.805 --> 02:15:14.873
THAT ARE.

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.007
INTENDED TO INCREASE COLLEGE

02:15:16.074 --> 02:15:17.476
PREPARATION AND COLLEGE

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:18.643
ATTENDANCE RATES AMONG LOW

INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:23.882
AND FOSTER YOUTH.

02:15:23.949 --> 02:15:24.749
I THE ASSEMBLY HAS AN ACTION TO

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:25.517
SHIFT SOME FUNDING FOR CREEK

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:26.918
TECHNICAL EDUCATION FROM A

02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:29.120
PROGRAM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY

02:15:29.187 --> 02:15:30.689
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO A

02:15:30.755 --> 02:15:31.690
DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAT'S

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.325
ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.960
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

02:15:35.026 --> 02:15:36.428
WE THINK THAT SHIFT CREATES MORE

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:38.063
COHERENT APPROACH TO CREATE

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:40.432
TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WOULD

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.400

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:45.804
DIFFERENCES THAT ARE IN

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:47.405
CONFERENCE SO PAGE FOR A SHOWING

02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:49.207
YOU THE DIFFERENCES AN ONGOING

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:49.741

WILL COVER ALL OF THESE ITEMS

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:57.716
AND LATER AGENDA ITEMS.

02:15:57.782 --> 02:15:58.850
BY TURNING TO PAGE SIX AND THE

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:00.318
COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF THE

02:16:00.385 --> 02:16:02.387
GOVERNOR PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:04.189
TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA THAT

YEAR.

02:16:06.324 --> 02:16:07.425
EACH HOUSE THEN WENT ON TO ADOPT

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:08.927
SOME OF ITS OWN MODIFICATIONS TO

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:09.895
THE FORMULA.

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:11.263
I BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES WE

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.631
THINK THE SENATE PLAN WOULD

02:16:12.697 --> 02:16:14.299
REDUCE SOME OF THE VOLATILITY IN

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:15.767
THE FORMULA WILL STILL PROVIDING

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:17.636
STRONG INCENTIVES -- FOR

02:16:17.702 --> 02:16:20.138
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO MAKE

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:22.240
IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES.

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:23.508
BOTH HOUSES ALSO PROVIDE MORE ON

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:24.943
GOING FUNDING FOR FACULTY -- BUT

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:26.177
THEY HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES IN

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:27.812
THE AMOUNT APPROVED.

02:16:27.879 --> 02:16:29.381
AND FINALLY THE HOUSES TAKE

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:30.815
DIFFERENT ACTIONS FOR SOME ST'S

02:16:30.882 --> 02:16:32.584
SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAMS FOR

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.185

IS ANSWERED HOUSING PROGRAMS.

02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:38.123
PAGE SEVEN SHOWS YOU THE KEY

02:16:38.189 --> 02:16:39.124
DIFFERENCE IS AN ONGOING

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:40.525
SPENDING FOR THE COMMUNITY

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.627
COLLEGES AND PAGE IT SHOWS YOU

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:45.230
THE DIFFERENCES AND ONE TIME

02:16:45.297 --> 02:16:47.666
SPENDING.

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:48.967

[inaudible]

02:16:54.339 --> 02:16:57.842
OF COURSE.

02:16:57.909 --> 02:17:00.211
SURE -- ON PAGE TWO THE SIZE OF

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:01.613
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:02.647

BUT HOUSE THE RAINY DAY FUND

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:11.656
HOUSE AT CALCULATED.

02:17:11.723 --> 02:17:13.425
SO THE SIZE OF THE DEPOSIT INTO

02:17:13.491 --> 02:17:15.694
THE RAINY DAY FUND IS DRIVEN BY --

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:17.028
SOME FORMALISM THE CONSTITUTION.

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:18.530
THAT WERE PART OF PROPOSITION

02:17:18.597 --> 02:17:21.600
TWO THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED IN.

02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:22.334
TWENTY FOURTEEN I AT A HIGH

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.568
LEVEL ARE THOSE FROM LESS

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:25.070
REQUIRED DEPOSITS WHEN THE

02:17:25.136 --> 02:17:26.671
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:27.472
GUARANTEE.

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:29.608
IS GOING FASTER THERE IS SWEETLY

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:30.709
ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.577
LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN

02:17:32.644 --> 02:17:33.945
STUDENT ATTENDANCE AN INFLATION

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:35.246
FACTOR.

02:17:35.313 --> 02:17:36.414
SO THE MORE REVENUE THAT YOU

02:17:36.481 --> 02:17:38.016
HAVE GENERALLY THE LIGHT TO

02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:39.284
DEPOSIT THAT'S REQUIRED THE

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.186
LOWER DEPOSITS UNDER THE HOUSES

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.420
PLANNER BECAUSE ARE MAINLY

02:17:42.487 --> 02:17:45.457
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOWER REVENUE

02:17:45.523 --> 02:17:46.891
ESTIMATES.

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:47.859
AND WHO WAS THE GOVERNOR'S.

02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:48.927
RECOMMENDATION CALCULATED

02:17:48.994 --> 02:17:50.862
ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA.

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.197
YES SO THE ADMINISTRATION

02:17:52.263 --> 02:17:53.932
PROPOSED MAKING THE DEPOSIT THAT

02:17:53.999 --> 02:17:56.368
WAS REQUIRED UNDER THEIR REVENUE

02:17:56.434 --> 02:17:57.869
PACKAGE.

02:17:57.936 --> 02:17:59.537
WE DO NOTE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE

02:17:59.604 --> 02:18:00.905
THE OPTION OF MAKING A LARGE

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:02.340
DEPOSIT THEN THAT AND THEN WHAT

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:03.441
IS REQUIRED.

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.076
BEGIN OPTIONAL DEPOSIT -- BUT

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.378
THE ADMINISTRATION A PROPOSED

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:07.779
MAKING THE CONSTITUTIONALLY

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:10.048
REQUIRED DEPOSIT UNDER THEIR

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:11.416
REVENUE ANOTHER ASSUMPTIONS

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:13.718
WHAT'S THE CURRENT BALANCE IN

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.120
THE RAINY DAY FUND -- CURRENTLY

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:15.954
IT HAS A ZERO BALANCE THE STATE

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.455
HAS YET TO MAKE A DEPOSIT INTO

02:18:17.522 --> 02:18:18.890
THE REST ARE PROPOSITION NINETY

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:21.393
EIGHT RESERVE.

02:18:21.459 --> 02:18:22.794
SO WE HAVE.

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:24.029
ZERO WITH GET THE GOVERNOR

02:18:24.095 --> 02:18:25.530
RECOMMENDING.

02:18:25.597 --> 02:18:26.998
THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED

02:18:27.065 --> 02:18:29.367
AMOUNT BUT WE HAVE BOTH HOUSES.

02:18:29.434 --> 02:18:32.504
BUT LOWER MATH.

02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:33.304
OKAY.

02:18:33.371 --> 02:18:36.808
NEXT QUESTION IS ON PAGE --

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.977
THREE ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.679
FUNDING THAT WAS.

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:42.013
WHY ONE OF THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:43.548
AT THE MAY REVISED?

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:45.450
WAS FOR THE GOVERNOR TO PUT MORE

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:47.986
FUNDING IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION --

02:18:48.053 --> 02:18:49.220
AND NOW THERE'S PUSH BACK IN YOU

02:18:49.287 --> 02:18:49.988
AGREE WITH THE PUSH BACK SO I'M

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:51.056
JUST WONDERING WAS HIS

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:51.956
ANNOUNCEMENT.

02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:54.426
WAS IT NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT OF

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.695
PREMATURELY WITH.

02:18:56.761 --> 02:18:58.463
I TINK WE HAD SOME OF THE SAME

02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:01.032
CONCERNS THAT WE HAD IN JANUARY --

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:01.933
THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.802
CHANGE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:05.904
PROGRAM IN MAY IT WAS BUT A MUCH

02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:07.906
LIGHTER DOLLAR AMOUNT -- SOME OF

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:08.873
THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.375
INCENTIVES THAT THE PROGRAM

02:19:10.442 --> 02:19:11.810
WOULD CREATE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD.

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:12.977
PENALIZE DISTRICTS THAT WERE%

02:19:13.044 --> 02:19:15.280
MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS REDUCING

02:19:15.346 --> 02:19:15.980
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:17.749
DISABILITIES -- WE ALSO THOUGHT

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:18.917
THERE WERE BETTER WAYS TO

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:20.118
DISTRIBUTE THAT FUNDING --

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.352
FOCUSING ON SOMETHING LIKE

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.755
EQUALIZATION COULD DISTRIBUTE

02:19:23.822 --> 02:19:24.389
THAT FUNDING A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:25.857
BROADLY -- THE GOVERNOR'S

02:19:25.924 --> 02:19:26.691
PROPOSAL ATTRACTED FUNDING

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:29.694
PRETTY NEARLY TO A SUBSET OF

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:31.696
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE.

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:32.297
OKAY -- WHICH HAS BEEN ONE OF

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:34.833
THE BAKER CRIES HAVING SERVED ON

02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:36.768
SUB ONE THAT TO GET MORE MONEY

02:19:36.835 --> 02:19:40.305
FOR A FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND

02:19:40.371 --> 02:19:41.573
SO THE GOVERNOR'S DURING THAT

02:19:41.639 --> 02:19:41.773
TIME.

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:42.907
ABOUT TRYING TO ADJUST THAT LAST

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:45.143
QUESTION ON PAGE FOR THE CT

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:47.345
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM WE'VE

02:19:47.412 --> 02:19:49.047
BEEN TRYING. TO ENCOURAGE --

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:50.582
MORE FUNDING FOR CAREER TRAINING

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:52.083
EDUCATION AND I'M JUST WONDERING

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:53.985
WHY IT'S IT'S ZERO ACROSS THE

02:19:54.052 --> 02:20:00.425
BOARD.

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:03.027
SURE SO FOR THAT THAT -- ONE

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:04.095
IT'S REALLY THE PROPOSAL IS

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:05.497
REALLY A SHIFT OF FUNDING SO

02:20:05.563 --> 02:20:07.499
IT'S MORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.567
TO FIND AT THE KICKOFF STRONG

02:20:09.634 --> 02:20:11.269
WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:12.937
OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.372
OR YOU WANT TO FIND THE CITY AND

02:20:14.439 --> 02:20:17.242
SOME OF GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:19.544
MORE OF A A COMPETITIVE GRANT

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:20.211
BASED PROGRAM THAT'S FROM OUT OF

02:20:20.278 --> 02:20:20.779
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:22.814
EDUCATION SO THAT'S REALLY THE

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:24.849
ISSUE THAT'S IN CONFERENCE.

02:20:24.916 --> 02:20:27.318
THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:20:27.385 --> 02:20:28.486

RESPOND AT ALL.

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:30.789
I'LL MAKE A COUPLE VERY BRIEF

02:20:30.855 --> 02:20:32.056
COMMENTS -- FIRST AND MOST

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.992
IMPORTANT ON THE PROPOSITION

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:35.326
NINETY EIGHT LEVEL -- THE

02:20:35.393 --> 02:20:36.094
ADMINISTRATION OF COURSE

02:20:36.161 --> 02:20:37.462
SUPPORTS OUR MAY REVISION

02:20:37.529 --> 02:20:38.897
REVENUES COMPLETE WITH THAT TAX

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:40.231
CONFORMITY PACKAGE WHICH WE

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:42.233
BELIEVE IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY

02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:43.835
AND ALSO PROVIDES MORE REVENUE.

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:45.370
ACOSTA BUDGET BUT I DO WANT TO

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:46.738

CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- ONE

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:50.575
IMPORTANT TO KNOW IF WE IF THAT

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:52.343
COMMITTEE ADOPTS A LOWER REVENUE

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:54.479
TARGET BUT OVER PROPERTY TO

ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED.

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.617
REVISION AND THEN -- BECAUSE AS

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:01.152

REVENUES NOT ESTIMATED REVENUES

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:06.925
SO REVENUES DO CON AND ABOVE --

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:07.892
WHAT THE LEGISLATOR IS

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:09.527
PROJECTION -- OVER THE UPCOMING

02:21:09.594 --> 02:21:11.529

THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:21.039
RATHER THAN BEING GOING DIRECTLY

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:22.073
TO SCHOOLS AT ALL AS THE

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:23.274
LEGISLATURE IS PROJECTING.

02:21:23.341 --> 02:21:24.442
SAID THAT COULD CREATE A WHOLE

02:21:24.509 --> 02:21:26.211
OF POSSIBLY SEVERAL HUNDRED

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:27.779
MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:32.350
PACKAGE IF THE LEGISLATURE MOVES

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:34.285

INCENTIVE GRANTS -- THEN IT WAS

02:22:44.822 --> 02:22:47.058
ASSEMBLY REMEMBER WHAT THE LOGIC

02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:50.461
WOULD THAT BE SHOWN PARTY.

02:22:50.528 --> 02:22:52.063
SURE THAT SYMPATHY WITH IT BUT I

LARGER ADVOCATES FOR C. T. AND

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:21.993
THE ASSEMBLY FELT IT WAS BETTER

TO KEEP IT IN OR THE EXISTING.

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:27.465
K. TWELVE CT PROGRAM AND THAT

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:33.071
THEY HAVE THE THE CENTER

SUPPORT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL SO

02:23:39.777 --> 02:23:43.081
WAS JUST A GOOD SOLID IN UNDER.

02:23:43.147 --> 02:23:44.582
ONE WELL AS AS A DADDY THE

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:46.351

MAYBE FOR NOW THE WHOLE

02:23:52.123 --> 02:23:54.125
INCENTIVE GRANT WAS WIPED OUT.

02:23:54.192 --> 02:23:55.326

AT A HIGHER LEVEL MR MCCARTY AND

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:24.015
I HAVE A BILL ALONG WITH

02:25:24.082 --> 02:25:25.183
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO CHEAT IT

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:26.517
EXPRESSES THE INTENT OF THE

02:25:26.584 --> 02:25:27.852
LEGISLATURE.

02:25:27.919 --> 02:25:28.920
TO GET.

02:25:28.986 --> 02:25:30.721
TO THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AMONG

02:25:30.788 --> 02:25:31.756

THAT WERE SENT OVER TO THE

02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:33.758
SENATE BUT NOT NOT THAT'S JUST

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:34.926
INTENT LANGUAGE THAT THE

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.427
DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THAT

02:25:36.494 --> 02:25:37.995
HAPPENED HERE.

02:25:38.062 --> 02:25:39.664
EVERY YEAR AND I'VE BEEN ON

02:25:39.730 --> 02:25:41.332
CONFERENCE DOWN THREE YEARS AND

02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:42.667
EVERY YEAR WE TALK ABOUT WANTING

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:44.302
TO FUND K. TWELVE EDUCATION AT A

02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:47.705
HIGHER LEVEL I THINK IF YOU LOOK

02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:49.073
AT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:50.575
K. TWELVE IN CALIFORNIA A LOT OF

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:51.542
THEM.

02:25:51.609 --> 02:25:54.045
STEM DIRECTLY FROM THE FACT THAT.

02:25:54.112 --> 02:25:55.813
WE DON'T FUNDED AN PPROPRIATE

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.515
LEVEL SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT

02:25:57.582 --> 02:25:58.983
THE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:25:59.050 --> 02:26:00.485
PLAN IS ON THIS.

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:01.219
AND THE REASON WHY I'M

02:26:01.285 --> 02:26:01.853
FRUSTRATED I MEAN I KNOW WE CAN

02:26:01.919 --> 02:26:03.421
POUND THE TABLE SO WE WANT MORE

02:26:03.488 --> 02:26:04.055
MONEY AND THERE IS MORE MONEY

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.356
BUT EERY TIME WE MAKE A

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:06.991
DECISION TO FIND.

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:08.326
ANOTHER PROGRAM AND I THERE'S

02:26:08.392 --> 02:26:09.861
LOTS OF NEEDS OUT THERE AND IT

02:26:09.927 --> 02:26:11.129
TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS EVERY

02:26:11.195 --> 02:26:12.864
TIME WE WE TALK ABOUT -- EARLY

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:15.266
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION OR

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:16.767
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OR

02:26:16.834 --> 02:26:18.236
AFTER SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW THAT

02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:19.604
THESE ARE ALL CERTAINLY GOOD.

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:21.105
PROGRAMS BUT EVERY TIME WE SPEND

02:26:21.172 --> 02:26:21.973
A DOLLAR IN ONE OF THOSE IT'S A

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:23.574
DOLLAR THAT WE COULD HAVE SPENT

02:26:23.641 --> 02:26:26.043
ON K. TWELVE AND I JUST KIND OF

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.310
FEEL LIKE.

02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:26.577
WE NEED.

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.312
TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT. TWO

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:30.081
EXCELLENTK. TWELVE EDUCATION

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:33.618
BEFORE WE DIVERSIFY SO. TO PUT

02:26:33.684 --> 02:26:35.186
IT BACK ON THE THE DEPARTMENT

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:36.654
FINANCES THEIR PLAN HERE YOU

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:38.489
KNOW YOUR EVERYYEAR TO GET TO A

02:26:38.556 --> 02:26:39.757
POINT WHERE WERE.

02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:41.893
NOT IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:43.794
PER CAPITA STUDENT FUNDING AND

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:45.029
FOR K. TWELVE AMONG STATES.

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.664
SO WE CERTAINLY SHARE THAT GOAL

02:26:46.731 --> 02:26:47.865
OF WANTING TO INVEST MORE IN OUR

02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:49.233
SCHOOLS THAT IS A PRIORITY OF

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.601
THE GOVERNOR AND SO THE FIRST

02:26:50.668 --> 02:26:51.602
POINT AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:53.137
BUT THIS HAPPENS YEAR BY YEAR

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:55.206
AND SO WE ARE NOW TO PROPOSITION

02:26:55.273 --> 02:26:55.773
NINETY EIGHT LEVEL.

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.708
LESS THAN A DECADE AGO WAS FORTY

02:26:57.775 --> 02:26:59.177
SEVEN BILLION NOW WE'RE

02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:00.845
PROPOSING ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:02.513
SO THAT'S OVER ABOUT FIVE

02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:03.614
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.249
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:27:05.316 --> 02:27:07.251
SO WOULD YOU THINK THAT IS WE

02:27:07.318 --> 02:27:08.586
ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION --

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:10.021
AND THEN THE SECOND POINT I WANT

02:27:10.087 --> 02:27:11.489
TO MAKE IS THAT THERE IS A

02:27:11.556 --> 02:27:13.124
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT HOW

02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:14.125
WE CAN INVEST EVEN MORE IN THE

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:15.693
YEARS TO COME CONSISTENT WITH

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:16.527
OTHER PRESSURES ON THE GENERAL

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:17.528
FUND.

02:27:17.595 --> 02:27:18.696
BUT I WILL POINT OUT IN THIS

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.731
BUDGET ALTHOUGH PROP PROPOSITION

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:21.299
NINETY EIGHT IS THE PRIMARY

02:27:21.365 --> 02:27:23.167
VEHICLE FOR SENDING MONEY TO

02:27:23.234 --> 02:27:24.435
SCHOOLS THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:25.002
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:26.437
TAKING THAT REALLY DO MAKE A BIG

02:27:26.504 --> 02:27:27.672
DIFFERENCE AND WE HAD A

02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:29.574
CONVERSATION ABOUT CAL STARS

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:30.374
BEFORE.

02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:31.008
THAT BY ITSELF THE

02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:32.076
ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:33.711
PROPOSALS OVER THREE BILLION

02:27:33.778 --> 02:27:35.246
DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO CAL

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.415
STARS -- ON BEHALF OF SCHOOLS WE

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:38.983
ALSO HAVE YOU MEASURES IN OUR

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:40.518
BUDGET FOR TEACHER TRAINING WERE

02:27:40.585 --> 02:27:41.586
ACTUALLY RE BENCHING THE

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:42.587
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:27:42.653 --> 02:27:44.188
GUARANTEEING PULLING OUT SOME

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:45.790
NON ELLIE A PRE CASE LOTS WE'RE

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.124
ADDING NEW PRE K. SLOT SO I

02:27:47.191 --> 02:27:48.526
THINK WHEN YOU ADD UPALL THESE

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:49.560
MEASURES TOGETHER.

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:50.728
IT IS A PRETTYSIGNIFICANT

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:52.630
PACKAGE RESPECTING THE FACT AS

02:27:52.697 --> 02:27:55.266
YOU STARTED THAT WE DO HAVE MORE

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.567
TO GO FROM HERE OKAY WELL.

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:58.002
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND I I

02:27:58.069 --> 02:27:58.936
THINK THAT.

02:27:59.003 --> 02:28:00.304
A LOT OF THE STATISTICS THAT I

02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:02.907
QUOTED DON'T INCLUDE EFFORTS

02:28:02.974 --> 02:28:03.474
INCLUDING THE ONES THAT YOU

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:05.343
MENTION IN OUR FACILITIES

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:12.483
FUNDING -- AND OUR BOND FUND AND

02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:14.385
THEN ANOTHER.

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:15.586
THAT WERE TAKING BUT I JUST

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:16.220
THINK WE ALL NEED TO BE MINDFUL

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:18.522
OF THE FACT THAT PROP.

02:28:18.589 --> 02:28:19.523
NINETY EIGHT IT IS COMPLETELY IN

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:20.424
A SEPARATE.

02:28:20.491 --> 02:28:21.058
CONSIDERATION THEY ON THE LEVEL

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:21.659
AT WHICH WE SHOULD BE FUNDING

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:22.260
EDUCATION AND I THINK WE GET

02:28:22.326 --> 02:28:22.960
CAUGHT UP.

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:26.631
IN THIS IDEA THAT PROP NINETY

02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:27.198
EIGHT HE SHOULD BE THE LEVEL

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:28.065
THAT WE FIND.

02:28:28.132 --> 02:28:29.634
K. TWELVE EDUCATION AT YOU KNOW

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:30.568
AND THEN WE MOVE ON TO OTHER

02:28:30.635 --> 02:28:31.769
THINGS AND IT'S KIND OF THIS

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:32.737
ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT I THINK

02:28:32.803 --> 02:28:34.205
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:36.207
LOOK AT WHAT OUR MISSION IS

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:37.675
SUPPOSED TO BE IN FUNDING K.

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:38.709
TWELVE FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:39.477
APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL FOR

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:39.677
THAT.

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.212
IS AND THEN JUST MAKE SURE

02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.881
THAT'S ABOVE WHAT PROP NINETY

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:45.016
EIGHT OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:46.484
PUTS ON WHICH WILL BE.

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:47.285
SO SO IN OTHER WORDS I MEAN I

02:28:47.351 --> 02:28:48.252
THINK THE PERSON WE'RE LOOKING

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:49.553
AT PROP NINETY EIGHT IS KIND OF

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:50.921
THE CEILING AND IT SHOULD BE THE

02:28:50.988 --> 02:28:52.023
FLOOR.

02:28:52.089 --> 02:28:53.758
AND I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU

02:28:53.824 --> 02:28:55.626
IN FUTURE YEARS TO YOU KNOW TO

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:56.827
BE MINDFUL OF THAT BECAUSE I

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:59.297
WANT TO BE SITTING HERE ANOTHER

02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:02.300
THREE YEARS FROM NOW HAVING THIS

02:29:02.366 --> 02:29:06.404
THE SAME DISCUSSION ABOUT IT

02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:06.704
[inaudible]

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:08.939
THE GARAGE.

02:29:09.006 --> 02:29:10.107
THANK YOU MISTER FISHER -- I

02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:13.044
JUST WANTED.

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.378
COME BACK TO THE STRONG WORK

02:29:14.445 --> 02:29:16.414
FORCE PROGRAM AND CREW TECH

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:17.948
EDUCATION CENTER BRIDGES FOR A

02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:19.216
MOMENT JUST.

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:21.552
TO INDICATE THAT I I HOPE WE CAN

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:22.887
CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE.

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:24.522
ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS I

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:26.257
UNDERSTAND THE K. TWELVE STRONG

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:27.358
WORK FORCE PROGRAM.

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:30.261
IT IS DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:31.929
REGIONAL WORK FORCE NEEDS.

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:34.732
PUTTING TRAINING FOLKS BOTH

02:29:34.799 --> 02:29:36.667
YOUNG AND SOME NOT SO YOUNG. FOR

02:29:36.734 --> 02:29:38.336
THE JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:40.404
A REGION.

02:29:40.471 --> 02:29:42.673
AND THAT THE CAREER TECH EDUCATE.

02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:45.109
EDUCATION SAID OF RIP PROGRAM IS

02:29:45.176 --> 02:29:46.544
MORE ALIGNED WITH GIVING.

02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:50.114
FOLKS SORT OF A A JOB EXPERIENCE

02:29:50.181 --> 02:29:51.582
IN TERMS OF WHAT'S OUT THERE.

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:52.616
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I HAVE THE

02:29:52.683 --> 02:29:53.818
RIGHT SIDE PICTURE ON IT THAT'S

02:29:53.884 --> 02:29:54.752
WHY I HOPE WE GET TO HAVE A

02:29:54.819 --> 02:29:56.287
DIALOGUE ON IT BUT IF THAT'S THE

02:29:56.354 --> 02:29:57.388
CASE.

02:29:57.455 --> 02:29:59.223
THEN FOR AREAS SUCH AS THE

02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:01.292
CENTRAL VALLEY IN FOR IN ONE

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:02.360
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:03.494
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S VERY

02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:06.097
IMPORTANT TO FUND PROGRAMS THAT

02:30:06.163 --> 02:30:07.498
ACTUALLY IDENTIFY.

02:30:07.565 --> 02:30:09.233
WHAT THE SKILLS ARE IN THE JOBS

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:10.935
ARE IN THE REGION?

02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:14.004
AND GIVE FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.740
TO TRAIN UP FOR THOSE JOBS SO

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:17.908
THEY ACTUALLY CAN SECURE.

02:30:17.975 --> 02:30:19.310
A GOOD SOLID.

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:21.712
WELL PAYING A POSITION AT THE

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:23.881
END OF THE OF THE PIPELINE AND

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:25.850
SO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:26.984
THAT IN MAY AND I DON'T FRANKLY

02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:28.753
CARE WHO RUNS IT COMMUNITY

02:30:28.819 --> 02:30:30.354
COLLEGE K. THROUGH TWELVE THAT'S

02:30:30.421 --> 02:30:31.822
I'M AGNOSTIC ON THAT.

02:30:31.889 --> 02:30:33.357
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

02:30:33.424 --> 02:30:34.492
CONVERSATION.

02:30:34.558 --> 02:30:36.894
ABOUT THAT -- BEFORE WE

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:38.396
ELIMINATE ONE PROGRAM -- IN

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:39.697
FAVOR OF ANOTHER ONE TO MAKE

02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:40.965
SURE THAT THE ONE WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:42.233
GOING TO THIS GOING TO BE THE

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:43.501
SURVIVOR.

02:30:43.567 --> 02:30:45.903
IS GOING TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH.

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:48.072
THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:49.273
OBJECTIVE AT LEAST FROM MY

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:50.841
PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO SAY

02:30:50.908 --> 02:30:51.842
THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A

02:30:51.909 --> 02:30:53.644
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT AS WE MOVE

02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:54.478
FORWARD.

02:30:54.545 --> 02:30:56.914
THANK YOU OF STRUCTURE WILL SAY --

02:30:56.981 --> 02:30:57.548
FROM FINANCE AND A BRIEF WE TURN

02:30:57.615 --> 02:30:59.150
INTO MY COLLEAGUE BUT THAT IS A

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:00.084
PERSPECTIVE THAT THE

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:01.619
ADMINISTRATION SHARES I THINK

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.187
THE GOAL OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:04.789
CREATE TECHNOLOGIC ASIAN

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:05.423
SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US CARE

02:31:05.489 --> 02:31:07.525
ABOUT BUT THAT SPECIFIC EMPHASIS

02:31:07.591 --> 02:31:09.059
ON REGIONAL COORDINATION

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:10.895
REGIONAL ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS.

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.263
AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS ACOSTA

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:14.465
INSTITUTIONS IN A SPECIFIC AREA

02:31:14.532 --> 02:31:15.666
IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE

02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:19.003
ADMINISTRATION MADE THE PROPOSAL

02:31:19.069 --> 02:31:21.071
THAT IT'D.

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:21.939
BUT MAY JUST FOLLOW UP I I DON'T

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:22.807
KNOW I ASSUME THERE'S SOME.

02:31:22.873 --> 02:31:24.608
STUDY YOUR REVIEW THAT AT SOME

02:31:24.675 --> 02:31:26.377
POINT WILL GO ON TO WHICH YOU

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:28.312
HAVE TO PROGRAMS IT ESSENTIALLY

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:29.480
DO THE SAME.

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:31.649
THAT SOMEWHAT DO THE SAME THING

02:31:31.715 --> 02:31:33.250
THAT WE CAN DETERMINE WHICH ONE

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:34.518
IS MORE.

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:35.920
EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING THE

02:31:35.986 --> 02:31:37.655
OBJECTIVE MAYBE THEY BOTH ARE

02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:38.823
AND IF THEY BOTH ARE MAYBE THEY

02:31:38.889 --> 02:31:40.524
MERGE AND IF THEY'RE NOT MAYBE

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:41.592
WE SHOULD JUST.

02:31:41.659 --> 02:31:42.993
ELIMINATE ONE OR THE OTHER

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.496
WHETHER IT'S STRONG WORKFORCE

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.364
WHETHER ITS CREW TECH -- IN SAID

02:31:47.431 --> 02:31:50.134
EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT I

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:51.335
DON'T KNOW.

02:31:51.402 --> 02:31:52.436
AMBER ALEXANDER WITH DEPARTMENT

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.237
OF FINANCE AND SENATOR ROTH

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:54.305
YOU'VE YOU'VE HAD ON THAT ONE OF

02:31:54.371 --> 02:31:55.773
THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

02:31:55.840 --> 02:31:57.007
K. TWELVE COMPONENT OF THE

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.542
STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM IN THE

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.110
C. T. E. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM.

02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:01.645
AND REALLY THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:04.315
WHY BOTH PROGRAMS EXIST AND WERE

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.549
ENACTED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:05.916
BUDGET.

02:32:05.983 --> 02:32:06.951
ON THE CAGE WALL FROM WORK FIRST

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:09.320
PROGRAM REALLY IS ALIGNED WITH

02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:11.722
REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS -- THE

02:32:11.789 --> 02:32:12.590
EIGHT REGIONS THAT ADMINISTER

02:32:12.656 --> 02:32:14.191
THE PROGRAMS DEVELOPED LOCAL

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:16.360
PLANS AND THAT IDENTIFIES THE

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:18.929
KEY PRIORITY INDUSTRY AREAS IN

02:32:18.996 --> 02:32:20.364
THEIR IN THEIR REGIONS.

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:22.233
AND THEN THE CITY PROGRAMS THAT

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:23.567
ARE AWARDED FUNDING UNDER THE

02:32:23.634 --> 02:32:25.936
GRANT PROGRAM HAVE TO ALIGN WITH

02:32:26.003 --> 02:32:27.204
THOSE IDENTIFIED REGION

02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:28.939
IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY PRIORITIES

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:31.909
THAT HAVE BEEN -- LOCALLY

02:32:31.976 --> 02:32:33.744
DETERMINED.

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:34.478
WE WILL THERE BE SOME ULTIMATE

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:37.147
REVIEWED TO DETERMINE.

02:32:37.214 --> 02:32:38.782
WHETHER ONE OR THE OTHER IT

02:32:38.849 --> 02:32:40.751
BETTER ACCOMPLISHES THE GOALS OF

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:42.253
WHETHER BOTH ACCOMPLISH VERY

02:32:42.319 --> 02:32:43.921
VERY IMPORTANT GOALS COMING TO

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:45.189
THE SAME.

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:47.892
POINT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:49.026
AND AND THATIS -- A DISCUSSION

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.628
THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE

02:32:50.694 --> 02:32:52.296
LAST YEAR I THINK THE DIFFERENCE

02:32:52.363 --> 02:32:53.430
BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS HAS

02:32:53.497 --> 02:32:55.032
REALLY THEIR OBJECTIVE THE

02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:56.000
CAREFUL STRONG WORK FORCE

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:57.735
PROGRAM IS IS MORE WORK FOR

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:58.536
STRIPPING.

02:32:58.602 --> 02:33:00.070

YOU KNOW TO INCENTIVIZE CITY

02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:04.608
PROGRAMS LOCALLY BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:06.810
NECESSARILY ALIGNED TO WORK

02:33:06.877 --> 02:33:08.679
FORCE NEEDS IN THE REGIONS -- SO

02:33:08.746 --> 02:33:09.914
THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:10.881
HAPPENING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT

02:33:10.948 --> 02:33:11.849
OF EDUCATION AND THE

02:33:11.916 --> 02:33:13.584
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ON HOW THE

02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:14.652
TWO PROGRAMS CAN COMPLEMENT EACH

02:33:14.718 --> 02:33:15.386
OTHER.

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.221
AND HOW -- ELEAZAR APPLYING FOR

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:18.622
BOTH PROGRAMS CAN LEVERAGE THAT

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:21.191
FUNDING TO REALLY PROMOTE CTP --

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:25.229

02:33:25.296 --> 02:33:26.363

02:33:27.264 --> 02:33:27.965
THIS I JUST WANTED.

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:29.266
TO INDICATE THAT I'D LIKE TO

02:33:29.333 --> 02:33:30.935
CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

02:33:31.001 --> 02:33:33.203
ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE ELIMINATE

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:34.838
ONE PROGRAM OVER ANOTHER.

02:33:34.905 --> 02:33:36.607

CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION --

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:12.309
THERE ARE A COUPLE SMALLER ITEMS

02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:14.011
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:15.813
HERE THE SENATE PROVIDED ONE

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:17.548
MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME

02:34:17.615 --> 02:34:19.249
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING.

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:20.217
TO A SCENE OF A COMMUNITY

02:34:20.284 --> 02:34:22.553
COLLEGE FOR CONSTRUCTION TRADES

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:23.287
PROGRAM.

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.888
AND THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED ONE

COLLEGES IN SIX DIFFERENT

02:34:28.258 --> 02:34:31.462
COUNTIES -- THE LARGEST ISSUE AS

02:34:31.528 --> 02:34:33.464
WE JUST DISCUSSED IN THE LAST --

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.431
ISSUE.

02:34:34.498 --> 02:34:36.600
IS THE ASSEMBLY SECTION TO

02:34:36.667 --> 02:34:40.404
CONSOLIDATE K..

02:34:40.471 --> 02:34:41.038
TWELVE TECHNICAL EDUCATION

02:34:41.105 --> 02:34:42.840
PROGRAMS UNDER THE EXISTING CITY

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:44.141
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM

02:34:44.208 --> 02:34:45.542
ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT

02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:47.011
OF EDUCATION.

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:48.479
AND AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE ARE

02:34:48.545 --> 02:34:49.980
RECOMMENDING THE ASSEMBLY IS

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:51.081
ACTION ON THIS.

02:34:51.148 --> 02:34:51.649
THING.

02:34:51.715 --> 02:34:53.183
WE ALL OF ALREADY HAD A

02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:54.752
PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS I WON'T

02:34:54.818 --> 02:34:56.420
BELABOR THESE POINTS.

02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:58.722
HELLO JUST NOTE THAT -- WHAT

02:34:58.789 --> 02:35:00.658
WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD IS

02:35:00.724 --> 02:35:01.425
THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.093
ABOUT WHAT WAS THE STATE'S

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.695
INTENSE AND SETTING UP THESE TWO

02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:07.431
PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH THERE IS --

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:08.866
THIS DIFFERENCE IN SCOPE THAT'S

02:35:08.932 --> 02:35:10.300
BEEN DISCUSSED ABOUT THE

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:14.171
ALIGNMENT WITH REGIONAL

02:35:14.238 --> 02:35:15.172
WORKFORCE NEEDS [inaudible]

02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:17.875
THAT'S NOT -- TAKING

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:19.810
CONTRADICTORY OF WITH THE GOALS

02:35:19.877 --> 02:35:21.045
OF THE SEATING INCENTIVE GRANT

02:35:21.111 --> 02:35:24.081
PROGRAM MOM MANY PROGRAMS ARE.

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:25.349
LOOKING AT BOTH OF THESE AS

02:35:25.416 --> 02:35:27.484
POTENTIAL SOURCES OF OF FUNDING

02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:29.253
AND SO THERE'S UNNECESSARY

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:31.522
DUPLICATION OF EFFORT IN TERMS

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:33.023
OF APPLICATIONS.

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:35.192
AND MAKING THESE DECISIONS ABOUT

02:35:35.259 --> 02:35:36.727
WHICH IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:38.395
FUNDS FOR US WE WE THINK.

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:39.830
THESE ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:41.565
BY CONSOLIDATING UNDER SINGLE

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:44.868
AGENCY CD DOES. TO OUR MIND

02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:45.736
APPEAR TO BE THE MOST

02:35:45.803 --> 02:35:47.538
APPROPRIATE AGENCY GIVEN THEIR

02:35:47.604 --> 02:35:49.206
HISTORY WORKING WITH K. TWELVE

02:35:49.273 --> 02:35:50.507
CT PROGRAMS.

02:35:50.574 --> 02:35:51.108
AND WE THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE

02:35:51.175 --> 02:35:52.843
DISCUSSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.344
REVISIT THE SCOPE OF THE C. T.

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:56.280
INCENTIVE GRANT IN MAKING THIS

02:35:56.346 --> 02:35:59.883
DECISION TO CONSOLIDATE UNDER

02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:04.788
THAT AGENCY [inaudible] THIRTY

02:36:04.855 --> 02:36:07.224
SKINNER.

02:36:07.291 --> 02:36:08.759
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

02:36:08.826 --> 02:36:11.328
LA -- IN IN.

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:12.429
MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION

02:36:12.496 --> 02:36:14.098
ASSESSED.

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.899
THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE THAT --

02:36:15.966 --> 02:36:22.773
GENERAL ROTH POINTED OUT OF THE

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.808
AT LEAST FROM WHAT THE MATERIALS

02:36:24.875 --> 02:36:27.444
I'VE READ ABOUT THE CITY.

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:28.545
PROGRAM WHICH I'M VERY

02:36:28.612 --> 02:36:30.581
SUPPORTIVE OF BUT IT IS NOT

02:36:30.647 --> 02:36:36.353
NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON THE JOB

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.721
SKILL DEVELOPMENT UNIQUE TO A

02:36:37.788 --> 02:36:41.592
PARTICULAR REGION -- SO IF YOU

02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:43.594
COULD ADDRESS THAT.

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:48.432
YEAH AS WAS DISCUSSED A LITTLE

02:36:48.499 --> 02:36:49.867
BIT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL.

02:36:49.933 --> 02:36:51.635
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:53.137
A SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:54.872
BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS IT

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:57.207
WOULD BE THE FOCUS THAT THE

02:36:57.274 --> 02:36:58.575
STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HAS.

02:36:58.642 --> 02:37:01.445
ON REGIONAL JOB SKILLS AND

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.380
CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS A

02:37:03.447 --> 02:37:06.350
REASONABLE INTEREST IN ST --

02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:08.118
THAT THAT POLICY OBJECTIVE IS

02:37:08.185 --> 02:37:11.255
INCLUDED AND THEIR K. TWELVE CT

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.422
PROGRAMS.

02:37:12.489 --> 02:37:14.958
WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- RATHER

02:37:15.025 --> 02:37:16.994
THAN CONTINUING THESE TWO

02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:19.196
PROGRAMS THAT ARE LARGELY

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:22.900
DUPLICATIVE WITH THIS -- THE

02:37:22.966 --> 02:37:25.102
SLIGHTLY NUANCED DIFFERENCE IN

02:37:25.169 --> 02:37:26.236
SCOPE.

02:37:26.303 --> 02:37:27.538
AB TO REVISIT THE SCOPE OF THE

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.206
C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM TO

02:37:29.273 --> 02:37:30.808
MAKE SURE THAT IT INCLUDES THAT

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:32.342
CONCERN IF THAT IS SOMETHING

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:32.709
THAT.

02:37:32.776 --> 02:37:33.877
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO BE

02:37:33.944 --> 02:37:39.716
A PRIORITY [inaudible]

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:43.020
SENATE ROTH.

02:37:43.086 --> 02:37:44.655
WELL I'M DO I'M JUST CURIOUS AND

02:37:44.721 --> 02:37:46.156

TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:49.626
SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTION AND GO

02:37:51.562 --> 02:37:53.463
WELL BUT IN THE IN THE X. CAREER

02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:55.065
TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTER GRANT

02:37:55.132 --> 02:37:56.433
PROGRAM IT'S ADMINISTERED BY

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:59.136
CITY.

02:37:59.203 --> 02:38:00.404
THAT'S CORRECT THE SOLE OF MY

UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO

02:38:01.471 --> 02:38:02.639
THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM

02:38:02.706 --> 02:38:04.341
IT'S SORT OF A REGIONAL CLEVER

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.243
TELL US I'M SORRY THAT SIXTEEN

02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.377
SENATE GRANT PROGRAM IS

02:38:07.444 --> 02:38:09.479
ADMINISTERED BY CDC THIS STRONG

02:38:09.546 --> 02:38:11.014
WORK FORCES MINISTERED BY.

02:38:11.081 --> 02:38:12.516
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RIGHT MY

02:38:12.583 --> 02:38:14.184
UNDERSTANDING ON THE STRONG WORK

02:38:14.251 --> 02:38:16.019
FORCE PROGRAM HOWEVER IT'S A

02:38:16.086 --> 02:38:16.687
IT'S A IT'S A REGIONAL

02:38:16.753 --> 02:38:18.388
CLEVERNESS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:21.358
BOARD'S EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS.

02:38:21.425 --> 02:38:26.330
A COMMUNITY COLLEGES K. THROUGH

02:38:26.396 --> 02:38:27.898
TWELVE ELEAZAR K.. TO TWELVE TO

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.233
TRY TO IDENTIFY JOB SKILLS AND

02:38:29.299 --> 02:38:31.134
THEN K. AS IN FOR IN TERMS OF SO

02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:33.070
THAT'S THE DEMAND SIDE WHICH

02:38:33.136 --> 02:38:34.605
FRANKLY I THINK WE NEED.

02:38:34.671 --> 02:38:36.240
TO IMPROVE BUT THAT'S THE DEMAND

02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:37.941
SIDE IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:39.576
SKILLS AND JOB NEEDS.

02:38:39.643 --> 02:38:41.578
AND THEN THE EDUCATIONAL A

02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:44.314
COLLABORATION DECIDES TO HOW TO

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:46.083
DESIGN THE THE EDUCATION AND

02:38:46.149 --> 02:38:48.185
TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO MEET THOSE

02:38:48.252 --> 02:38:49.786

WHETHER IT'S AT THE COMMUNITY

02:38:51.255 --> 02:38:53.423

EDUCATION CENTER GRANT PROCESS.

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:04.434
IN COMPASS THAT SAME TYPE OF OF

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:06.103
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

02:39:06.169 --> 02:39:07.905
BUT NOT ON A REGIONAL BASIS NOW

02:39:07.971 --> 02:39:08.205
[inaudible]

02:39:08.272 --> 02:39:10.274
OKAY.

THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible]

02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:16.446
QUESTIONS.

02:39:16.513 --> 02:39:17.047
I JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT FROM

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:18.482
PLEASE -- SO I KNOW WE'VE TALKED

02:39:18.548 --> 02:39:19.583
ABOUT THE STRONG WORK FORCE

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:22.019
VERSUS C. T. -- SPECIFICALLY ON

02:39:22.085 --> 02:39:23.754
THE INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:26.490
COLLEGES -- THE ADMINISTRATION --

02:39:26.556 --> 02:39:28.091
SUPPORTS ITS OWN PROPOSAL AND

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:28.558
DOES NOT SUPPORT THOSE

02:39:28.625 --> 02:39:30.093
AUGMENTATIONS -- NOT BECAUSE

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:31.495
THEY'RE NOT WORTHY PROGRAMS BUT

02:39:31.561 --> 02:39:32.863
BECAUSE THEY FALL WITHIN THAT

02:39:32.930 --> 02:39:34.097
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:39:34.164 --> 02:39:34.998

PAYING DOWN THE PRINCIPAL OF OF

02:41:11.595 --> 02:41:12.729

THE SENATE PROVIDES ONE POINT

APART FROM THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:36.787
THERE REALLY TWO MAJOR

02:41:36.853 --> 02:41:38.455
DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PLANS.

02:41:38.522 --> 02:41:39.556
FIRST THE GOVERNOR PROVIDES

02:41:39.623 --> 02:41:41.358
RELIEF SPECIFICALLY FOR TEACHERS

02:41:41.425 --> 02:41:42.726
AND OTHER EMPLOYEES COVERED BY

02:41:42.793 --> 02:41:44.594
CAL STAR IS WHEREAS BOTH HOUSES

02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:46.363
PROVIDE RELIEF FOR EMPLOYEES

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:49.066
COVERED -- FOR BY EITHER PENSION

02:41:49.132 --> 02:41:50.133
SYSTEM.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.168
THE GOVERNOR IN THE ASSEMBLY

02:41:51.234 --> 02:41:53.503
ALSO PROPOSED TO PAY FOR ALL OF

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:55.939
THAT RELIEF NOW AS PART OF THE

02:41:56.006 --> 02:41:56.940
NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET.

02:41:57.007 --> 02:41:58.375
WHERE IS THE SENATE DIFFERS SOME

02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:01.745
OF THOSE COSTS TO NEXT YEAR'S

02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:03.180
BUDGET?

02:42:03.246 --> 02:42:03.713
TURNING TO THE LONG TERM

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:04.481
PROPOSALS AT THE GOVERNOR AND

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.916
BOTH HOUSES MAKE A PAYMENT OF

02:42:05.982 --> 02:42:07.184
TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO

02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:08.351
REDUCE.

02:42:08.418 --> 02:42:10.120
THE SCHOOL SHARE OF UNFUNDED

02:42:10.187 --> 02:42:11.421
LIABILITIES THAT CAL STAR IS.

02:42:11.488 --> 02:42:12.989
BY THE ASSEMBLY MAKES THAT

02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:15.525
PAYMENT BUT ALSO HAS ANOTHER

02:42:15.592 --> 02:42:17.294
PAYMENT OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION --

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:19.529
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE POOL OF

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:20.931
FUNDS -- THAT'S USED TO

02:42:20.997 --> 02:42:23.467
ADMINISTER BENEFITS -- FOR

02:42:23.533 --> 02:42:26.837

PAYMENT TO CAL CALPERS --

02:42:29.106 --> 02:42:29.873
TURNING TO PAGE.

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.374
THREE WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:34.511
PLANS HAVE A BOTH SHORT TERM AND

02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:36.613
LONG TERM RELATE RATE RELEASE ON

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:37.848
THAT SIDE WAS A KEY PART OF ALL

02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:38.715
THREE PACKAGES.

02:42:38.782 --> 02:42:40.717
BUT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES BEFORE

02:42:40.784 --> 02:42:43.487
YOU IS ON THE MARGIN HOW MUCH

02:42:43.553 --> 02:42:45.388
FUNDING YOU ONE ALLOCATE NOW TO

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:46.590
SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:47.591
RELEASE.

02:42:47.657 --> 02:42:49.226
AND AND MAKING THAT DECISION WE

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:52.095
WOULD URGE YOU TO PRIORITIZE THE

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:54.931
LONG TERM RELIEF. ONE REASON IS

02:42:54.998 --> 02:42:55.499
THAT THAT GETS YOU AGREE TO

02:42:55.565 --> 02:42:56.433
RETURN. FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU PUT

02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.601
IN THE SHORT TERM RELEASED A

02:42:57.667 --> 02:42:59.870
SCHOOL SAVE A DOLLAR OVER THE

02:42:59.936 --> 02:43:01.371
COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS --%

02:43:01.438 --> 02:43:02.506
BUT FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU PUT

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:04.441
INTO LONG TERM RELIEF A SCHOOL

02:43:04.508 --> 02:43:06.443
SAVE TWO TO THREE DOLLARS OVER

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:07.777
THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

02:43:07.844 --> 02:43:09.546
ANOTHER REASON IS THAT THE LONG

02:43:09.613 --> 02:43:11.815
TERM RELIEF PROVIDES -- SORT OF

02:43:11.882 --> 02:43:13.216
BUDGET HELP FOR DISTRICTS ON

02:43:13.283 --> 02:43:15.185
MORE OF A SUSTAINED BASIS SO

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:15.886
RATHER THAN JUST HELPING

02:43:15.952 --> 02:43:17.654
DISTRICTS BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS

02:43:17.721 --> 02:43:19.089
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS -- THAT

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:20.223
COULD HELP SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT

02:43:20.290 --> 02:43:22.125
THE ECONOMIC UPS AND DOWNS THAT

02:43:22.192 --> 02:43:24.928
LIE AHEAD.

02:43:24.995 --> 02:43:31.201
A HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:43:31.268 --> 02:43:35.539

02:43:40.377 --> 02:43:43.446
I'M SORRY BELIEVE FOR AN ISSUE.

02:43:43.513 --> 02:43:47.317

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:56.899
PROPOSAL -- WHICH YES AS NOTED

02:52:56.966 --> 02:52:58.801
EARLIER -- HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE

02:52:58.868 --> 02:53:01.571
JANUARY -- WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:04.040
ON ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RATHER

02:53:04.107 --> 02:53:05.775
SUCH OCCASION IN AREAS OF THE

02:53:05.842 --> 02:53:07.610
STATE WHERE THERE ARE -- LAYERS

02:53:07.677 --> 02:53:10.480
OF CHALLENGES SO OUR FOCUS IS ON

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:11.547
AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

02:53:11.614 --> 02:53:13.149
HIGH PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS

02:53:13.216 --> 02:53:14.484
WITH DISABILITIES.

02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:16.819
AS WELL AS HIGH PERCENTAGES OF

02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:18.387
STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME --

02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:19.589
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.624
USE IN FOSTER CARE WHAT WE'RE

02:53:21.691 --> 02:53:22.191
TRYING TO GET OUT WITH OUR

02:53:22.258 --> 02:53:24.060
PROPOSAL -- IS THE UNIQUE

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:25.328
CHALLENGES FACED BY THE KEEP BY

02:53:25.394 --> 02:53:27.897
THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THESE.

02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:31.267
CONCENTRATIONS OF POPULATIONS --

02:53:31.334 --> 02:53:34.637
THAT ARE IN AND IN THE SCHOOLS --

02:53:34.704 --> 02:53:37.106
AND I I I I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:38.908
THAT -- THERE IS SOME CONCERN

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:42.278
AROUND -- THE NUMBER OF SCHOOLS

02:53:42.345 --> 02:53:43.312
THAT ARE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

02:53:43.379 --> 02:53:43.846
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE

02:53:43.913 --> 02:53:45.114
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING

02:53:45.181 --> 02:53:47.116
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

02:53:47.183 --> 02:53:47.750
WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS AND

02:53:47.817 --> 02:53:48.417
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.

02:53:48.484 --> 02:53:50.153
TARGETING THE FUNDING -- IN

02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:52.588
REGARDS TO THE TWO PROPOSALS --

02:53:52.655 --> 02:53:53.856
PROVIDED BY BOTH THE SENATE AND

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:55.291
THE ASSEMBLY I THINK OUR MAJOR

02:53:55.358 --> 02:53:57.927
CONCERNS ON THE EARLY EDUCATION

02:53:57.994 --> 02:54:00.663
PIECE -- ARE JUST THE AS THE

02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:01.964
NATURE OF HOW THE FUNDING IS

02:54:02.031 --> 02:54:03.366
PROVIDED ON AN EIGHTY A BASE

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:04.300
MODEL.

02:54:04.367 --> 02:54:05.902
WHICH MAY GROW IN THE OUT YEARS

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:06.869
AT A GREATER RATE THAN THE

02:54:06.936 --> 02:54:07.837
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:08.504
GUARANTEE GROSSED WE ARE

02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:09.806
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FISCAL

02:54:09.872 --> 02:54:10.973
IMPACTS OF THAT.

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:11.974
OF AN ADDITIONAL THE SENATE'S

02:54:12.041 --> 02:54:15.178
PROPOSAL AND THE PROVISION OF

02:54:15.244 --> 02:54:16.279
EARLY TRANSIT OR THE EXTENSION

02:54:16.345 --> 02:54:17.346
OF REALLY TRANSITIONAL

02:54:17.413 --> 02:54:19.782
KINDERGARTEN TO INCLUDE --

02:54:19.849 --> 02:54:20.950
CHILDREN WITH IT PEACEFUL WE WE

02:54:21.017 --> 02:54:22.318
DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY

02:54:22.385 --> 02:54:23.686
WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT.

02:54:23.753 --> 02:54:25.855
GIVEN THE NATURE OF PROP NINETY

02:54:25.922 --> 02:54:27.523
EIGHT IN THE ON GOING A PICTURE

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:29.559
THAT -- HERE WE MAKE WE MAY FREE

02:54:29.625 --> 02:54:31.060
UP SOME FUNDS IN THE BUDGET

02:54:31.127 --> 02:54:32.261
YOU'RE FOR THAT BUT THAT THE

02:54:32.328 --> 02:54:33.996
GUARANTEE DOESN'T NECESSARILY

02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:39.769
GROW IN THE OUT YEARS. TO

02:54:39.836 --> 02:54:40.369
ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASED COST

02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:41.838
OF THAT [inaudible]

02:54:41.904 --> 02:54:43.439
MESSAGING.

02:54:43.506 --> 02:54:44.974
ARE DISCUSSED EARLIER COMMENT ON

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:47.410
THE COMMISSION POLLS.

02:54:47.476 --> 02:54:50.246
HERE WE WE WE COMMENDED

02:54:50.313 --> 02:54:51.013
REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:53.149
PROPOSAL AND WE HAD SEVERAL

02:54:53.216 --> 02:54:54.383
MAJOR CONCERNS WITH IT.

02:54:54.450 --> 02:54:56.552
OUR OUR IRST MAJOR CONCERN WAS

02:54:56.619 --> 02:55:00.223
THAT A ADOPTED THE INAPPROPRIATE

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:02.859
AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FISCAL

02:55:02.925 --> 02:55:04.694
INCENTIVES FOR THE SCHOOL

02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:07.997
DISTRICTS WOULD BE RECEIVING THE

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:10.233
FUNDING -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:12.335
PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE THAT.

02:55:12.401 --> 02:55:14.203
EACH ELIGIBLE CHILD WOULD

02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:16.405
GENERATE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND

02:55:16.472 --> 02:55:19.242
DOLLARS AND ON GOING FUNDING.

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:20.476
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE

02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:22.044
BENEFITING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:23.212
PROPOSAL.

02:55:23.279 --> 02:55:27.416
BY CONTRAST THE AVERAGE STUDENT

02:55:27.483 --> 02:55:28.618
WAS SPECIAL EDUCATED.

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:30.119
RECEIVING SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:55:30.186 --> 02:55:31.921
SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVES

02:55:31.988 --> 02:55:33.389
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:35.491
SERVICES FROM LOCAL FUNDING

02:55:35.558 --> 02:55:36.359
SOURCES.

02:55:36.425 --> 02:55:37.593
THIS INDICATES THAT THERE'S A

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.662
VERY STRONG INCENTIVE NOT ONLY

02:55:39.729 --> 02:55:41.831
TO NOT REDUCE SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:43.466
IDENTIFICATION RATES IN THOSE

02:55:43.532 --> 02:55:44.767
DISTRICTS PUT ACTUALLY TO

02:55:44.834 --> 02:55:47.937
INCREASE THEM IN ORDER TO SECURE

02:55:48.004 --> 02:55:48.704
ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

02:55:48.771 --> 02:55:50.106
IN ADDITION WE ARE CONCERNED

02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:51.540
ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDING

02:55:51.607 --> 02:55:53.276
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS

02:55:53.342 --> 02:55:54.510
HAS BEEN NOTED.

02:55:54.577 --> 02:55:56.579
OF RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF

02:55:56.646 --> 02:55:57.813
DISTRICTS WOULD QUALIFY FOR

02:55:57.880 --> 02:55:59.448
FUNDING ABOUT A QUARTER OF

02:55:59.515 --> 02:56:00.616
DISTRICTS WOULD RECEIVE ANY

02:56:00.683 --> 02:56:02.351
FUNDING.

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:03.986
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

02:56:04.053 --> 02:56:06.455
AND LOOKING AT THE COLLECTION OF

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:07.890
DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT WE

02:56:07.957 --> 02:56:09.659
WE DON'T SEE A PARTICULAR RHYME

02:56:09.725 --> 02:56:10.493
OR REASON.

02:56:10.559 --> 02:56:11.761
THERE'S NO STRONG CORRELATION

02:56:11.827 --> 02:56:12.828
BETWEEN THE LIST OF

02:56:12.895 --> 02:56:14.196
BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE

02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:17.166
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND LISTED --

02:56:17.233 --> 02:56:19.068
AND SELF REPORTED SPECIAL

02:56:19.135 --> 02:56:20.536
EDUCATION EXPENDITURES THERE ARE

02:56:20.603 --> 02:56:22.438
MANYDISTRICTS THAT HAVE VERY

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:23.506
HIGH SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:56:23.572 --> 02:56:24.507
EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD RECEIVE

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:25.775
NOTHING.

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:27.176
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:56:27.243 --> 02:56:28.611
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTRICTS

02:56:28.678 --> 02:56:30.479
THAT HAVE -- BELOW AVERAGE

02:56:30.546 --> 02:56:31.948
SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES

02:56:32.014 --> 02:56:34.016
THAT WOULD RECEIVE A QUITE A LOT

02:56:34.083 --> 02:56:36.118
OF FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:56:36.185 --> 02:56:38.354
PROPOSAL.

02:56:38.421 --> 02:56:39.722
JUST A FALL TWO MINISTRATION

02:56:39.789 --> 02:56:41.958
COULD YOU COMMENT AS TO WHY.

02:56:42.024 --> 02:56:45.494
ONLY TWENTY FIVE WHY WHY YOU

02:56:45.561 --> 02:56:46.095
CHOSE TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

02:56:46.162 --> 02:56:46.963
ONLY.

02:56:47.029 --> 02:56:48.798
REALLY BENEFIT 25% OF THE

02:56:48.864 --> 02:56:50.333
DISTRICTS IN A TIME WHEN THE

02:56:50.399 --> 02:56:52.668
POPULATION ACROSS THE STATE'S

02:56:52.735 --> 02:56:53.903
GROWING.

02:56:53.970 --> 02:56:55.538
CERTAINLY SO I I WOULD REFER

02:56:55.604 --> 02:56:57.073
BACK TO MY COMMENTS FROM EARLIER

02:56:57.139 --> 02:56:59.375
ABOUT -- WANTING TO TARGET THESE

02:56:59.442 --> 02:57:01.877

02:57:01.944 --> 02:57:04.547
THAT HAVE -- THIS SORT OF A

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:06.282
GREAT NUMBER GREATEST NUMBER OF

02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:08.351

02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:11.020
POPULATION OF STUDENTS THAT MAY

02:57:11.087 --> 02:57:12.955
HAVE IN ADDITION TO NEEDING

02:57:13.022 --> 02:57:14.890

WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE

02:57:28.237 --> 02:57:29.739

02:57:31.540 --> 02:57:32.942
OF GREAT INTEREST FOR THIS

02:57:33.009 --> 02:57:34.510
GOVERNOR AND I THINK REGARDLESS

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.112
OF THE OUTCOME OF THIS

02:57:36.178 --> 02:57:38.080

THAT ARE CURRENTLY INHERENT IN

02:57:52.061 --> 02:57:53.195
OUR EIGHTY SIX OH TWO FORMULA

02:57:57.767 --> 02:58:00.002
SO.

02:58:00.069 --> 02:58:02.338
I HAVE SOME BASIC CONCERNS ABOUT

02:58:02.405 --> 02:58:04.006
THE CONCENTRATION GRANT ANYWAY.

02:58:04.073 --> 02:58:04.540
WHERE YOU HAVE TO SCHOOL

02:58:04.607 --> 02:58:07.109
DISTRICT LINED UP SIDE BY SIDE?

02:58:07.176 --> 02:58:08.844
SCHOOLS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE

02:58:08.911 --> 02:58:11.747
LINE ONE DISTRICT OVER 55% FREE

02:58:11.814 --> 02:58:12.982
AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH

02:58:13.049 --> 02:58:14.517
LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER KIDS

02:58:14.583 --> 02:58:18.054
THE OTHER ONE WAS LESS THAN 55% --

02:58:18.120 --> 02:58:19.855
BUT BOTH HAVE AS A DISTRICT BUT

02:58:19.922 --> 02:58:23.159
BOTH HAVE 70%.

02:58:23.225 --> 02:58:24.660
IN THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS.

02:58:24.727 --> 02:58:27.496
FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH

02:58:27.563 --> 02:58:29.565

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:30.666
ONE DISTRICT GETS A

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:33.069
CONCENTRATION GRANT RIGHT.

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:35.371
THE OTHER DISTRICT DOESN'T.

02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:37.373
BUT THE PERCENTAGES IN THE

02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:39.075
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL SITES.

02:58:39.141 --> 02:58:42.278
ARE THE SAME.

02:58:42.344 --> 02:58:44.046
IT DOESN'T COST ANY LESS IN THE

02:58:44.113 --> 02:58:46.282
ONE DISTRICT TO EDUCATE THE KIDS.

02:58:46.348 --> 02:58:48.117
THEN IN THE OTHER THE MONEY GOES

02:58:48.184 --> 02:58:50.219
THROUGH THE DISTRICT NOT BE

02:58:50.286 --> 02:58:51.520
BASED ON THE SCHOOL SITE RIGHT.

02:58:51.587 --> 02:58:53.355
TO UNDERSTAND MY POINT YES I I

02:58:53.422 --> 02:58:54.690
THINK I'M I MAY BE

02:58:54.757 --> 02:58:56.258
MISUNDERSTANDING YOU SO --

02:58:56.325 --> 02:58:58.561
ACCORDING TO OUR FORMULAS THE S.

02:58:58.627 --> 02:59:00.529
ANY SCHOOL THAT HAS -- AND

02:59:00.596 --> 02:59:01.864
DUPLICATED -- CFF PERCENTAGE

02:59:01.931 --> 02:59:04.066
ABOVE 55% SO I I BELIEVE IN BOTH

02:59:04.133 --> 02:59:05.534
QUé IN THIS CASE BOTH OF THE

02:59:05.601 --> 02:59:06.168
SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE TALKING

02:59:06.235 --> 02:59:09.238
ABOUT -- COOL SITE IS SUPPOSED

02:59:09.305 --> 02:59:12.875
TO DISTRICT NO SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:59:12.942 --> 02:59:14.343
I'M TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL SITES.

02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:15.111
TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH THEN

02:59:15.177 --> 02:59:18.514
ALLOCATE FUNDS -- FOR AT ALL ALL

02:59:18.581 --> 02:59:19.682
STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL SITE

02:59:19.748 --> 02:59:21.083
BASED ON THEIR LOCAL CONTROL

02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:22.384
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. ONE

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:24.086
DISTRICT GETS CONCENTRATION

02:59:24.153 --> 02:59:25.621
GRANT AND THE OTHER DOESN'T

02:59:25.688 --> 02:59:27.857
CORRECT -- I BELIEVE THAT BOTH

02:59:27.923 --> 02:59:28.858
OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UNDER

02:59:28.924 --> 02:59:30.092
YOUR EXAMPLE WOULD RECEIVE

02:59:30.159 --> 02:59:31.227
FUNDING FOR CONCENTRATION IF

02:59:31.293 --> 02:59:32.928
THEY HAD A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE

02:59:32.995 --> 02:59:33.729
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS A

02:59:33.796 --> 02:59:35.131
DISABILITY RETIREMENT

02:59:35.197 --> 02:59:36.699
DISABILITIES NOW.

02:59:36.765 --> 02:59:38.300
ON TOP OF MY BASIC PROBLEM WITH

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:39.902
CONCENTRATION GRANTS.

02:59:39.969 --> 02:59:41.237
SO THAT I'LL GET TO MY QUESTION

02:59:41.303 --> 02:59:45.074
WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN.

02:59:45.141 --> 02:59:46.041
FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH

02:59:46.108 --> 02:59:47.376
LANGUAGE LEARNER AND FOSTER

02:59:47.443 --> 02:59:47.676
[inaudible]

02:59:47.743 --> 02:59:49.245
CHILD.

02:59:49.311 --> 02:59:50.980
PERCENTAGES IN A DISTRICT AND

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:53.315
EDUCATING SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS

02:59:53.382 --> 02:59:56.185
BECAUSE THE DISTRICT FORTY GETS

02:59:56.252 --> 02:59:58.020
CONCENTRATION GRANT MONEY. TO

02:59:58.087 --> 02:59:59.555
EDUCATE THE FREE AND REDUCED

02:59:59.622 --> 03:00:01.790
LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

03:00:01.857 --> 03:00:03.058
AND FOSTER KIDS.

03:00:03.125 --> 03:00:04.426
WE'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT SPECIAL

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:06.262
NEEDS.

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:08.364
YOUNG FOLKS AND THE EXTRA MONEY

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:09.899
THAT IT TAKES TO EDUCATE THEM SO

03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:11.667
WHAT'S THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:13.802
CONCENTRATION GRANT PEAS.

03:00:13.869 --> 03:00:16.205
AND FUNDING SPECIAL EDUCATION

03:00:16.272 --> 03:00:18.274
AND THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:19.708
AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

03:00:19.775 --> 03:00:21.377
SO YOU CAN CORRECT ME THAT'S MY

03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:22.778
PROBLEM IS THE GOVERNOR'S

03:00:22.845 --> 03:00:24.480
PROPOSAL.

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:25.514
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE

03:00:25.581 --> 03:00:26.415
CLARIFICATION I THINK I

03:00:26.482 --> 03:00:27.683
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NOW SO

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:29.818
WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:33.322
PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE --

03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:35.724
AS I'D IDENTIFIES AND DUPLICATED

03:00:35.791 --> 03:00:37.026
FOR THE PURPOSES OF ELSE EFF.

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:38.961
ON THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS --

03:00:39.028 --> 03:00:40.829
WITH DISABILITIES WHO IDENTIFIED

03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:43.799
FOR LC FF -- WERE HIGHER THAN

03:00:43.866 --> 03:00:44.266
THE STUDENTS WITHOUT

03:00:44.333 --> 03:00:45.901
DISABILITIES WHO ALSO QUALIFIED

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:47.203
AS AN DUPLICATED FOR THE

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:48.470
PURPOSES OF L. CFF.

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:49.505
AND THAT CONCENTRATION WAS

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:51.073
SPECIFICALLY STRONGER AMONG

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:52.575
FOSTER YOUTH AND ENGLISH

03:00:52.641 --> 03:00:55.477
LANGUAGE LEARNERS -- FOSTER USE

03:00:55.544 --> 03:00:57.079
HAD AS MANY MAGNITUDES OF

03:00:57.146 --> 03:00:58.814
INCREASE FOR LIKELIHOOD OF BE

03:00:58.881 --> 03:01:02.418
IDENTIFIED -- FOR HAVING IT AS A

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:04.453
NEED FOR AN IEP -- SO THERE IS A

03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:06.121
CORRELATION BETWEEN BEING A

03:01:06.188 --> 03:01:10.426
DUPLICATED STUDENT AND HAVING A

03:01:10.492 --> 03:01:11.860
DISABILITY.

03:01:11.927 --> 03:01:12.461
WELL YOU KNOW THE PRICE AS I

03:01:12.528 --> 03:01:13.095
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND THIS

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:13.996
IS MY FIRST YEAR.

03:01:14.063 --> 03:01:15.831
AT THIS RODEO IN EDUCATION BUT

03:01:15.898 --> 03:01:18.200
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE COST OF

03:01:18.267 --> 03:01:20.469
EDUCATING SPECIAL NEEDS YOUNG

03:01:20.536 --> 03:01:21.604
FOLKS.

03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:24.840
IS SO GREAT -- WAS THAT THE

03:01:24.907 --> 03:01:26.275
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY

03:01:26.342 --> 03:01:28.210
CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS IN --

03:01:28.277 --> 03:01:29.745
SPECIAL ED ARENA DOESN'T IT I

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:30.813
MEAN SOME.

03:01:30.879 --> 03:01:32.448
DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO GET MORE

03:01:32.514 --> 03:01:34.483
MONEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE OF

03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:36.619
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ENGLISH

03:01:36.685 --> 03:01:37.219
LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER KIDS

03:01:37.286 --> 03:01:39.388
AND AND FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.090
AND OTHER DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO

03:01:41.156 --> 03:01:43.592
BE LEFT WITH WHAT THEY GET UNDER

03:01:43.659 --> 03:01:44.660
THE NORMAL.

03:01:44.727 --> 03:01:46.662
SPECIAL NEEDS FUNDING ALLOCATION

03:01:46.729 --> 03:01:49.298
FORMULA WHICH IS CERTAINLY

03:01:49.365 --> 03:01:51.233
INSUFFICIENT EVEN AT THE HIGHEST

03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:52.167
LEVEL.

03:01:52.234 --> 03:01:54.837
WHAT IS NET FOUR HUNDRED AND

03:01:54.903 --> 03:01:55.337
NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR

03:01:55.404 --> 03:01:56.405
SOMETHING?

03:01:56.472 --> 03:01:58.674
SO -- I THINK THAT ONE THING I'D

03:01:58.741 --> 03:01:59.675
LIKE TO KIND OF GO BACK ON HIS

03:01:59.742 --> 03:02:01.043
EARLY COMMENT I MADE ABOUT YOU

03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:02.077
THIS WE SEE THIS IS SORT OF A

03:02:02.144 --> 03:02:03.479
FIRST STEP AND AGAIN THIS IS A

03:02:03.545 --> 03:02:05.514
TARGET APPROACH FOR THE DOLLARS

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:07.149
THAT WE'RE PROPOSING -- ON A

03:02:07.216 --> 03:02:08.717
MULTI YEAR PROCESS IN WHICH WE

03:02:08.784 --> 03:02:10.452
LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF HOW WE

03:02:10.519 --> 03:02:12.554
FUND ON SPECIAL EDUCATION THE

03:02:12.621 --> 03:02:13.455
STATE.

03:02:13.522 --> 03:02:15.958
ANDSO SO WE SEE THIS AS SORT OF

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:17.426
STEP ONE BUT RECOGNIZING THAT

03:02:17.493 --> 03:02:18.527
YES THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS

03:02:18.594 --> 03:02:20.496
ON THINGS LIKE EQUALIZATION OF

03:02:20.562 --> 03:02:22.965
BASE RATES -- EXTREMELY HIGH

03:02:23.032 --> 03:02:24.433
COST LOW INCIDENCE A STUDENTS IN

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:25.401
THE COST OF CARE FOR THOSE

03:02:25.467 --> 03:02:26.802
STUDENTS WE RECOGNIZE THOSE

03:02:26.869 --> 03:02:28.203
THINGS AND WE AND WE DEFINITELY

03:02:28.270 --> 03:02:29.238
WANT TO HAVE.

03:02:29.305 --> 03:02:30.773
MORE LONG TERM DISCUSSIONS WITH

03:02:30.839 --> 03:02:31.540
THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO

03:02:31.607 --> 03:02:32.775
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES I'LL JUST

03:02:32.841 --> 03:02:34.209
MAKE ONE POINT ON THAT AS

03:02:34.276 --> 03:02:35.311
JESSICA MENTIONED.

03:02:35.377 --> 03:02:36.779
THE END GOAL IS REALLY TO GET

03:02:36.845 --> 03:02:38.280
MORE RESOURCES ACROSS AS WE WERE

03:02:38.347 --> 03:02:40.349
DISCUSSING FOR THIS SPECIFIC --

03:02:40.416 --> 03:02:41.884
AND YOU POINTED OUT THE NEXUS

03:02:41.950 --> 03:02:43.285
THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE

03:02:43.352 --> 03:02:45.354
ADMINISTRATION THAT -- SCHOOLS

03:02:45.421 --> 03:02:46.955
WITH UNDER LOCATED PEOPLES.

03:02:47.022 --> 03:02:48.457
WHO ALSO HAVE KIDS WITH SPECIAL

03:02:48.524 --> 03:02:50.392
NEEDS -- SOLVING BOTH OF THOSE

03:02:50.459 --> 03:02:52.428
TOGETHER CREATES ADDITIONAL

03:02:52.494 --> 03:02:53.962
CHALLENGES COMPARED TO SOLVING

03:02:54.029 --> 03:02:55.431
ONE OR THE OTHER AND THEIR

03:02:55.497 --> 03:02:56.398
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE

03:02:56.465 --> 03:02:58.367
NEEDED SO FOR THIS AUGMENTATION

03:02:58.434 --> 03:03:02.371
WE WANT TO TARGET THAT NEXUS

03:03:02.438 --> 03:03:04.573
THAT YOU MENTION.

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:05.574
OKAY THANK YOU.

03:03:05.641 --> 03:03:07.242
IF I MAY CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE OUR

03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:08.010
OFFICES DONE SOME WORK ON THE

03:03:08.077 --> 03:03:10.279
OVERLAP BETWEEN.

03:03:10.346 --> 03:03:11.647
THOSE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS INDIAN

03:03:11.714 --> 03:03:13.515
DUPLICATE ACCOUNT INSTANCE WITH

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:16.285
DISABILITIES-- WE WOULD AGREE

03:03:16.352 --> 03:03:19.388
WITH FINANCE THE THERE IS --

03:03:19.455 --> 03:03:21.590
OVERLAP AND IT DOES VERY BASED

03:03:21.657 --> 03:03:22.858
ON THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.

03:03:22.925 --> 03:03:24.760
IN PARTICULAR FOSTER YOUTH ARE

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:27.396
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DISABILITIES

03:03:27.463 --> 03:03:28.864
AND FOR THAT SPECIFIC REASON --

03:03:28.931 --> 03:03:30.699
THE STATE'S CURRENT K. TWELVE

03:03:30.766 --> 03:03:32.134
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING

03:03:32.201 --> 03:03:36.071
PROGRAM -- INCLUDES ME OUT OF

03:03:36.138 --> 03:03:37.973
HOME CARE -- FUNDING FORMULA

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.508
WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING

03:03:39.575 --> 03:03:41.810
SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE AREAS THAT

03:03:41.877 --> 03:03:44.079
SERVE MORE FOSTER CHILDREN MORE

03:03:44.146 --> 03:03:44.913
SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FOR

03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:45.481
THEM.

03:03:45.547 --> 03:03:49.518
THE ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE MORE

03:03:49.585 --> 03:03:51.253
COMPLICATED.

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:52.454
BASED ON THE LITERATURE ITS

03:03:52.521 --> 03:03:53.922
SUCCESS THAT IS LARGELY.

03:03:53.989 --> 03:03:55.724
REFLECTIVE OF INAPPROPRIATE

03:03:55.791 --> 03:03:59.628
DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES THAT -- OR

03:03:59.695 --> 03:04:01.964
OR INEFFECTIVE TREATMENT

03:04:02.030 --> 03:04:04.333
PROCEDURES WHERE -- WHEN A CHILD

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.169
HAS BOTH -- ENGLISH LANGUAGE

03:04:07.236 --> 03:04:09.204
PROFICIENCY DIFFICULTIES AND A

03:04:09.271 --> 03:04:11.340
DISABILITY IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

03:04:11.407 --> 03:04:12.641
TO IDENTIFY THAT DISABILITY

03:04:12.708 --> 03:04:15.411
DISENTANGLE IT AND PROVIDE THEM --

03:04:15.477 --> 03:04:16.512
APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS AND

03:04:16.578 --> 03:04:18.347
RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS

03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:21.016
MADE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THAT

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:23.318
DIAGNOSIS OF A PROBLEM AND

03:04:23.385 --> 03:04:25.954
DEVELOPING A NEW MANUAL THROUGH

03:04:26.021 --> 03:04:27.189
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

03:04:27.256 --> 03:04:28.824
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT ISSUE WHEN

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:30.392
IT COMES TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:33.729
THIS IS LARGELY WHAT IS DRIVING.

03:04:33.796 --> 03:04:34.997
THE STATE'S ARE AT THE

03:04:35.063 --> 03:04:36.632
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SPECIAL

03:04:36.698 --> 03:04:38.000
EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS

03:04:38.066 --> 03:04:39.601
PROPOSAL IS THE NUMBER OF LOW

03:04:39.668 --> 03:04:40.969
INCOME STUDENTS AND WE JUST

03:04:41.036 --> 03:04:42.604
DON'T FIND A STRONG CORRELATION

03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:44.373
BETWEEN THAT POPULATION INSTANCE

03:04:44.440 --> 03:04:45.340
WITH DISABILITIES.

03:04:45.407 --> 03:04:46.775
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LITERATURE

03:04:46.842 --> 03:04:48.243
THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS AND

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:50.112
SOME STUDIES FIND A POSITIVE

03:04:50.179 --> 03:04:51.180
CORRELATION BUT MANY OF THEM

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:52.147
DON'T.

03:04:52.214 --> 03:04:53.816
AND LARGELY THE ONES THAT DON'T

03:04:53.882 --> 03:04:55.984
FIND THAT CORRELATION USE AT

03:04:56.051 --> 03:04:57.986
FOUR PM AS THEIR MEASUREMENT.

03:04:58.053 --> 03:05:00.055
OF STUDENT POVERTY THAT JUST

03:05:00.122 --> 03:05:01.824
TENDS NOT TO SHOW A STRONG

03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:03.292
CORRELATION WITH STUDENTS WITH

03:05:03.358 --> 03:05:04.460
DISABILITIES.

03:05:04.526 --> 03:05:06.228
AND MY AND MY ONE OF MY PROBLEMS

03:05:06.295 --> 03:05:07.095
IS.

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:09.731
A DISTRICT THAT HAS 51%.

03:05:09.798 --> 03:05:11.366
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS FREE

03:05:11.433 --> 03:05:16.572
AND REDUCED LUNCH FOSTER KIDS

03:05:16.638 --> 03:05:17.406
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL [inaudible]

03:05:17.473 --> 03:05:18.974
GETS.

03:05:19.041 --> 03:05:19.575
AND NOW FUNDING NOTHING UNDER

03:05:19.641 --> 03:05:22.144
THIS NEW PROPOSAL OTHER THAN

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:22.811
WHAT THE DISTRICT WOULD NORMALLY

03:05:22.878 --> 03:05:25.113
GET SOONER WILL SPECIAL

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.482
EDUCATION FUND ON OCCASION RIGHT.

CORRECT SO THE DIFFERENCE OF

03:05:30.385 --> 03:05:31.954
FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS MAKES A

03:05:32.020 --> 03:05:33.222
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GETTING EXTRA

03:05:33.288 --> 03:05:34.623
MONEY.

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:36.625
AND NO MONEY.

03:05:36.692 --> 03:05:38.527
IN AN ARENA WHERE NOBODY GETS

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:41.163
ENOUGH MONEY. TO COVER THE COST

03:05:41.230 --> 03:05:42.698
OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SO WHAT

03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:43.799
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SORT THIS

03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:44.766
OT I APPRECIATE THE

03:05:44.833 --> 03:05:46.502
ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO TRY

03:05:46.568 --> 03:05:49.404
TO DO THIS AND I'M NOT GOING TO

03:05:49.471 --> 03:05:51.073
BELABOR ANYMORE THANK YOU

03:05:51.139 --> 03:05:51.373

THIS -- THIS THIS PLAN.

03:06:01.950 --> 03:06:03.285
HAS.

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:04.820
A COUPLE BIG WINNERS.

03:06:04.887 --> 03:06:06.455
LARGELY THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN

03:06:06.522 --> 03:06:08.457
LARGELY -- LA UNIFIED SCHOOL

03:06:08.524 --> 03:06:10.659
DISTRICT WHICH IS A BIG DISTRICT

03:06:10.726 --> 03:06:12.160
AND NEEDS HELP HAS A BIG ISSUE

03:06:12.227 --> 03:06:13.195
WITH.

03:06:13.262 --> 03:06:14.530
WHAT SPECIAL AT POPULATION BUT

03:06:14.596 --> 03:06:16.164
THIS IS THE ISSUE AND ALL OF OUR

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:18.100
DISTRICTS AND ACTUALLY THE

03:06:18.166 --> 03:06:19.401
PROPOSAL FOR LA THAT WOULD HAVE

03:06:19.468 --> 03:06:21.236
HELPED LA HELP HELP SACRAMENTO A

03:06:21.303 --> 03:06:22.704
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

03:06:22.771 --> 03:06:23.772
EQUALIZATION BUT?

03:06:23.839 --> 03:06:26.074
IT JUST IT THAT WAS AN A FAIR.

03:06:26.141 --> 03:06:27.910
PLANNED FOR THE OTHER SIX

03:06:27.976 --> 03:06:30.579
DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT AND THE

03:06:30.646 --> 03:06:31.380
THOUSAND DISTRICTS ACROSS

03:06:31.446 --> 03:06:33.015
CALIFORNIA SO.

03:06:33.081 --> 03:06:34.483
I THINK THE THE SENATE AND

03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:36.385
ASSEMBLY -- GOT A RIGHT HERE

03:06:36.451 --> 03:06:38.120
RECOGNIZING THERE IS A NEED BUT

03:06:38.186 --> 03:06:39.888
THERE IS THERE IS A A FAIR WAY

03:06:39.955 --> 03:06:43.292
TO ALLOCATE.

03:06:43.358 --> 03:06:44.459
THE RESOURCES THANK YOU.

03:06:44.526 --> 03:06:45.861
THANK YOU AND MISS SKINNER

03:06:45.928 --> 03:06:46.161
[inaudible]

03:06:46.228 --> 03:06:47.229
THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:06:47.296 --> 03:06:49.398
SEVERAL.

03:06:49.464 --> 03:06:52.401
WORKED WHERE I'M.

03:06:52.467 --> 03:06:53.368
SORT OF HAVING TROUBLE AS WELL.

03:06:53.435 --> 03:06:55.304
IN GENERAL WE DO NOT FIND

03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:58.173
SPECIAL EDUCATION ADEQUATELY AND

03:06:58.240 --> 03:07:00.776
WELL ALL THREE PROPOSALS ARE A

03:07:00.842 --> 03:07:01.910
STEP.

03:07:01.977 --> 03:07:03.812
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH YOU

03:07:03.879 --> 03:07:05.581
KNOW VARIOUS PROS AND CONS.

03:07:05.647 --> 03:07:06.548
WOULD PROBABLY STILL DON'T GET

03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:09.051
IT AT GET USOUT WHAT WE NEED

03:07:09.117 --> 03:07:09.551
WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN

03:07:09.618 --> 03:07:13.021
ACKNOWLEDGED -- BUT ON THE

03:07:13.088 --> 03:07:14.256
ALEJO'S POINT WELL THERE.

03:07:14.323 --> 03:07:16.191
WHILE THE RESEARCH MAY NOT SHOW

03:07:16.258 --> 03:07:18.594
A CORRELATION BETWEEN A HIGHER

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:22.097
NUMBER OF SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS AND

03:07:22.164 --> 03:07:24.166
INCOME IN OTHER WORDS THAT.

03:07:24.232 --> 03:07:28.503
I WONDER IF WE HAVE ANY DATA ON

03:07:28.570 --> 03:07:33.408
THE THE HOW WELL.

03:07:33.475 --> 03:07:35.377
THE CHILDREN.

03:07:35.444 --> 03:07:37.346
IN OUR LOWER INCOME SCHOOL

03:07:37.412 --> 03:07:39.848
DISTRICTS.

03:07:39.915 --> 03:07:41.550
ARE IDENTIFIED.

03:07:41.617 --> 03:07:43.685
WITH A SPECIAL NEED OR NOT IN

03:07:43.752 --> 03:07:43.986
OTHER WORDS.

03:07:44.052 --> 03:07:45.487
IT.

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:47.122
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.

03:07:47.189 --> 03:07:49.391
OR I COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE'S

03:07:49.458 --> 03:07:51.059
FACTORS THAT.

03:07:51.126 --> 03:07:53.362
CONTRIBUTE TO A LITTLE LOWER

03:07:53.428 --> 03:07:54.830
DETECTION RATE.

03:07:54.896 --> 03:07:56.932
PARTLY THE SCHOOL ITSELF.

03:07:56.999 --> 03:07:58.500
GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY

03:07:58.567 --> 03:08:02.437
FIND -- SPECIAL NEEDS THAT IT'S

03:08:02.504 --> 03:08:04.539
NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SCHOOL

03:08:04.606 --> 03:08:06.308
DISTRICT'S INTERESTS AND I'M NOT

03:08:06.375 --> 03:08:07.876
SAYING THAT IN YOUR PURPOSE WE

03:08:07.943 --> 03:08:09.411
TRYING TO DO IT BUT THIS IS NOT

03:08:09.478 --> 03:08:11.079
NECESSARILY IN THEIR INTERESTS

03:08:11.146 --> 03:08:12.247
TO IDENTIFY.

03:08:12.314 --> 03:08:13.582
WHAT'S OF KIDS WHO NEED ARE YOU

03:08:13.649 --> 03:08:16.251
PIECE -- SO THAT MAY BE A FACTOR

03:08:16.318 --> 03:08:20.355
ADDITIONALLY -- DEPENDING ON THE

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:22.190
OTHER PRESSURES THE PARENT OR

03:08:22.257 --> 03:08:24.359
PARENTS OF THE LOWER INCOME

03:08:24.426 --> 03:08:26.828
CHILD MAY HAVE IS OR EVEN THEIR

03:08:26.895 --> 03:08:29.564
ACCESS TO OTHER -- HEALTH CARE

03:08:29.631 --> 03:08:30.832
THAT MIGHT.

03:08:30.899 --> 03:08:33.502
IDENTIFY THAT SPECIAL NEEDS THAT

03:08:33.568 --> 03:08:34.836
I WOULD GUESS THAT THERE WOULD

03:08:34.903 --> 03:08:37.039
BE DATA THAT INDICATES THAT ARE

03:08:37.105 --> 03:08:38.540
MIDDLE INCOME IN HIGHER INCOME

03:08:38.607 --> 03:08:40.809
SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROBABLY HAVE A

03:08:40.876 --> 03:08:42.277
HIGHER IDENTIFICATION.

03:08:42.344 --> 03:08:46.615
OF KIDS IF WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:47.983
I GUESS WHAT.

03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:49.451
I WHAT I EAT.

03:08:49.518 --> 03:08:51.486
ON THE ONE HAND I SEE THE LOCAL

03:08:51.553 --> 03:08:53.588
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

03:08:53.655 --> 03:08:56.491
TRYING TO GET AT IF THAT IF WHAT

03:08:56.558 --> 03:08:58.126
I'M DESCRIBING IS REAL.

03:08:58.193 --> 03:09:00.328
MORE FINDING TO THE LOWER INCOME

03:09:00.395 --> 03:09:02.064
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRY TO HELP

03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:04.700
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE PROPER

03:09:04.766 --> 03:09:06.668
VALUATION AND IF THERE ARE KIDS

03:09:06.735 --> 03:09:09.037
WITH -- I EP NEEDS WE CAN GET

03:09:09.104 --> 03:09:09.971
THEM THE AP.

03:09:10.038 --> 03:09:11.106
ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT YOU'VE

03:09:11.173 --> 03:09:12.507
RAISED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A

03:09:12.574 --> 03:09:14.042
PERVERSE.

03:09:14.109 --> 03:09:15.544
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS.

03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:18.680
BUT HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE.

03:09:18.747 --> 03:09:24.953
A I MEAN WE WANT EVERY KID WHO

03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:26.021
IS ACTUALLY.

03:09:26.088 --> 03:09:28.190
IN NEED OF AN I. E. P. M. THEIR

03:09:28.256 --> 03:09:29.257
APPROPRIATE SPECIAL NEEDS --

03:09:29.324 --> 03:09:32.961
FINDING TO GET THAT SO.

03:09:33.028 --> 03:09:34.629
WHAT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE I THINK

03:09:34.696 --> 03:09:36.198
THAT'S REALLY FOR ME THE

03:09:36.264 --> 03:09:37.766
CHALLENGE HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH

03:09:37.833 --> 03:09:40.869
THAT?

03:09:40.936 --> 03:09:42.704
THINK IT SAID.

03:09:42.771 --> 03:09:46.241
VERY PERSONAL QUESTION -- IT'S A

03:09:46.308 --> 03:09:48.643
FIRST TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:51.513
UNDERLYING MECHANISMS FOR THE

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:54.216
CORRELATION BETWEEN INCOME AND

03:09:54.282 --> 03:09:57.152
DISABILITY WHICH I MENTIONED

03:09:57.219 --> 03:09:57.886
BRIEFLY EARLIER.

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.454
THERE ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING

03:09:59.521 --> 03:10:01.923
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT --

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:04.860
CAUSAL MECHANISMS FIRST THERE IS

03:10:04.926 --> 03:10:06.995
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT -- POOR

03:10:07.062 --> 03:10:08.697
MATERNAL HEALTH AND IN

03:10:08.764 --> 03:10:10.031
PARTICULAR PORT MATERNAL

03:10:10.098 --> 03:10:11.733
NUTRITION WHICH IS ASSOCIATED

03:10:11.800 --> 03:10:13.401
WITH THE INCOME.

03:10:13.468 --> 03:10:14.369
IS LINKED WITH LOWER BIRTH

03:10:14.436 --> 03:10:16.071
THROUGH WEIGHTS WHICH ARE LINKED

03:10:16.138 --> 03:10:18.039
WITH THE INCIDENCE OF SPECIFIC

03:10:18.106 --> 03:10:19.775
LEARNING DIABILITIES WHICH ARE

03:10:19.841 --> 03:10:21.676
BOTH THE MOST COMMON.

03:10:21.743 --> 03:10:23.845
SOURCE OF DISABILITY AMONG K.

03:10:23.912 --> 03:10:26.014
TWELVE STUDENTS AND THE LARGEST

03:10:26.081 --> 03:10:27.315
SOURCE OF VARIABILITY BETWEEN

03:10:27.382 --> 03:10:29.684
IDENTIFICATION RATES BETWEEN

03:10:29.751 --> 03:10:30.786
DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

03:10:30.852 --> 03:10:32.320
NO COUNTRVAILING THIS AND THIS

03:10:32.387 --> 03:10:34.256
IS MORE OF AN ANECDOTAL POINT IS

03:10:34.322 --> 03:10:35.824
SOMETHING.

03:10:35.891 --> 03:10:37.425
THAT I THINK YOU WERE GETTING AT

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:38.660
THIS IDEA THAT.

03:10:38.727 --> 03:10:40.729
IN MORE AFFLUENT AREAS WHERE

03:10:40.796 --> 03:10:42.297
THERE ARE MORE CUT THROAT

03:10:42.364 --> 03:10:43.698
PARENTS WERE WHO ARE THINKING

03:10:43.765 --> 03:10:44.566
ABOUT.

03:10:44.633 --> 03:10:46.601
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND WHAT NOT

03:10:46.668 --> 03:10:48.904
THAT THERE IS IN SOME CASES IF

03:10:48.970 --> 03:10:50.572
YOU IF YOUR CHILD THE STRUGGLING

03:10:50.639 --> 03:10:52.274
THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN.

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:53.275
GET THEM AND I A P. AND THAT

03:10:53.341 --> 03:10:54.810
WILL GIVE THEM ADDITIONAL

03:10:54.876 --> 03:10:56.478
ACADEMIC SUPPORT WHICH WILL

03:10:56.545 --> 03:10:59.548
ULTIMATELY -- A SYSTEM GOING ON

03:10:59.614 --> 03:11:00.649
I WOULD SAY I AM NOT SEEN

03:11:00.715 --> 03:11:02.317
RIGOROUS DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT

03:11:02.384 --> 03:11:04.386
IS IN FACT HAPPENING I HAVE

03:11:04.452 --> 03:11:05.353
HEARD IT FROM THE FIELD.

03:11:05.420 --> 03:11:07.255
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS

03:11:07.322 --> 03:11:09.257
COMBINATION OF FACTORS WHICH

03:11:09.324 --> 03:11:10.725
INDICATE THAT BOTH LOW INCOME

03:11:10.792 --> 03:11:12.160
AND HIGH INCOME SHOULD BE

03:11:12.227 --> 03:11:14.462
ASSOCIATED WITH DISABILITIES IS

03:11:14.529 --> 03:11:14.996
ONE REASON WHY THE LEISURE

03:11:15.063 --> 03:11:15.897
DOESN'T SHOW.

03:11:15.964 --> 03:11:17.899
A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN

03:11:17.966 --> 03:11:19.434
INCOME.

03:11:19.501 --> 03:11:21.303
AND DISABILITY RATES.

03:11:21.369 --> 03:11:22.470
NOW.

03:11:22.537 --> 03:11:24.239
IT'S CERTAINLY JUST BRIEFLY

03:11:24.306 --> 03:11:29.845
EARLIER DOESN'T SHOW THAT

03:11:29.911 --> 03:11:31.079
CORRELATION BUT WHAT ABOUT.

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:32.480
X. SO THAT'S JUST FLAT WHETHER

03:11:32.547 --> 03:11:32.781
THEY EXIST.

03:11:32.848 --> 03:11:35.050
THAT -- SPECIAL NEED EXISTS OR

03:11:35.116 --> 03:11:36.184
NOT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL

03:11:36.251 --> 03:11:38.286
IDENTIFICATION OF THE NEED.

03:11:38.353 --> 03:11:43.458
YES SO I THINK THAT IS A VERY --

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:45.293
CURRENT OF OBSERVATION AND

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:46.962
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AN ON

03:11:47.028 --> 03:11:48.597
GOING POLICY CONCERN OF COURSE

03:11:48.663 --> 03:11:50.866
THE INTENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS

03:11:50.932 --> 03:11:52.334
WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:54.302
IS THAT ALL STUDENTS WITH

03:11:54.369 --> 03:11:56.037
SPECIAL NEEDS WILL BE IDENTIFIED

03:11:56.104 --> 03:11:57.339
IN WILL BE PROVIDED WITH

03:11:57.405 --> 03:11:59.040
APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALIZED

03:11:59.107 --> 03:12:00.876
SUPPORT.

03:12:00.942 --> 03:12:02.544
THAT GOAL IS.

03:12:02.611 --> 03:12:06.147
NOT BEING REALIZED I THINK IS A

03:12:06.214 --> 03:12:09.918
FAIR STATEMENT -- BY THE THE

03:12:09.985 --> 03:12:10.919
QUESTION BàN HOW DO WE

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:12.320
RECOGNIZE IN EVERY SINGLE

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:14.089
INSTANCE FOR EVERY STUDENT

03:12:14.155 --> 03:12:16.758
WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GIVE

03:12:16.825 --> 03:12:18.660
THEM AN AYE A PEER.

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:19.895
NINE I THINK THE LITERATURE

03:12:19.961 --> 03:12:21.096
WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE'S SOME

03:12:21.162 --> 03:12:22.497
DANGER IN TRYING TO ANSWER THAT

03:12:22.564 --> 03:12:24.099
QUESTION THROUGH YOUR FUNDING

03:12:24.165 --> 03:12:25.133
MECHANISM.

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:28.603
THAT THE MORE LIKELY RESULT OF

03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:30.305
TRYING.

03:12:30.372 --> 03:12:30.839
TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE THE

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:33.241
IDENTIFICATION THROUGH THE VERY

03:12:33.308 --> 03:12:34.843
BLUNT INSTRUMENT OF PROVIDING

03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:36.311
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH MORE OR

03:12:36.378 --> 03:12:38.513
LESS FUNDING OFTEN JUST RESULTS

03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:39.848
AND CHILDREN BEING

03:12:39.915 --> 03:12:42.050
INAPPROPRIATELY OVER IDENTIFIED

03:12:42.117 --> 03:12:43.885
WITH DISABILITIES.

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:45.453
AND SO PERHAPS.

03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:48.390
FINDING THE MORE NUANCED ANSWER

03:12:48.456 --> 03:12:49.491
TO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

03:12:49.557 --> 03:12:51.226
EVERY CHILD WHO HAS SPECIAL

03:12:51.293 --> 03:12:52.127
NEEDS.

03:12:52.193 --> 03:12:53.762
IS BEING SO IDENTIFIED PERHAPS

03:12:53.828 --> 03:12:55.964
WE SHOULD LOOK AT OTHER POLICY

03:12:56.031 --> 03:13:00.902
TOOLS RATHER THAN FUNDING.

03:13:00.969 --> 03:13:01.770
THANK YOU HAVE A COUPLE

03:13:01.836 --> 03:13:04.773
CONVERSATION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

03:13:04.839 --> 03:13:05.373
BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

03:14:40.035 --> 03:14:41.569
RECENTLY FLAGS FOR TECHNICAL

03:14:41.636 --> 03:14:43.271
ASSISTANCE SOLELY BASED ON POOR

03:14:43.338 --> 03:14:44.172
PERFORMANCE.

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:45.340
FROM THEIR STUDENTS WITH

03:14:45.407 --> 03:14:48.743

LOWEST PERFORMING INDIVIDUALS

03:15:07.028 --> 03:15:09.197
ARE AND SO I THINK OF JUST

03:15:09.264 --> 03:15:10.265
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T JUST

03:15:10.331 --> 03:15:11.833
SIMPLY TARGET ENGLISH LANGUAGE

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:13.234
LEARNERS ONLY BUT THE ENGLISH

03:15:13.301 --> 03:15:14.369
PROFICIENCY.

03:15:14.436 --> 03:15:15.770
IS OBVIOUSLY A GREAT NEED

03:15:15.837 --> 03:15:17.472
BECAUSE ALL THE PHOTOS OF THE

03:15:17.539 --> 03:15:18.706
FOLKS THAT REALLY AT THE BOTTOM

03:15:18.773 --> 03:15:20.075
BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT

YOU'VE JUST GIVEN US SO.

03:15:21.209 --> 03:15:22.410
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO STAFF

03:15:22.477 --> 03:15:23.945
DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING WE NEED

03:15:24.012 --> 03:15:25.346
TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE GREATEST

03:15:25.413 --> 03:15:27.182
NEED IS IN TERMS OF THE GAS AND

03:15:27.248 --> 03:15:28.950
WE SEE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

03:15:29.017 --> 03:15:30.452
TERMS OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

03:15:30.518 --> 03:15:32.087
AND THOSE AREAS OF THE AREAS

03:15:32.153 --> 03:15:33.822
WHERE WE GET THE LEAST AMOUNT OF

03:15:33.888 --> 03:15:35.890
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

03:15:35.957 --> 03:15:37.292
NOT THAT WE DO AN AWFUL LOT WE

03:15:37.358 --> 03:15:39.194

IN THE DISTRICTS BUT WE DO VERY

03:15:45.767 --> 03:15:46.901
LITTLE TRAINING ON ENGLISH

03:15:46.968 --> 03:15:48.169
PROFICIENCY.

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:50.271
AND THAT CUTS ACROSS ALL OF THE

03:15:50.338 --> 03:15:52.340
AREAS WHERE OUR STUDENTS ARE NOT

03:15:52.407 --> 03:15:53.842
PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH WITH THIS

03:15:53.908 --> 03:15:56.277
WRITTEN OR ORAL LANGUAGE AND

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:57.479

TRAINING AND ADMINISTRATORS GET

03:16:05.253 --> 03:16:06.421
MY TRAINING SO THAT THEY

03:16:06.488 --> 03:16:07.522

PROFICIENCY IS.

DEAL WITH THE STUDENTS WHO ARE

03:16:12.760 --> 03:16:13.928

03:19:23.017 --> 03:19:26.921
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT IS

03:19:26.988 --> 03:19:28.489
THE RIGHT APPROACH.

03:19:28.556 --> 03:19:29.023

THE ROOT MOST THAT PREVIOUS

03:23:56.357 --> 03:23:57.458
ISSUE WE BELIEVE THAT DISTRICTS

CAN APPROACH THAT FOR LCS FAST

03:23:59.927 --> 03:24:00.795

STILL LOOKING AT THE DATA AND

03:24:02.396 --> 03:24:04.732
IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR THAT

03:24:04.799 --> 03:24:05.499

03:24:05.566 --> 03:24:06.133
EVERYTHING.

03:24:14.508 --> 03:24:15.276
FUNDING IS A LITTLE BIT

03:24:15.343 --> 03:24:16.677
PREMATURE IN THE SENSE OF WE'RE

03:24:16.744 --> 03:24:18.245

IF YOU EIGHTEEN CONSISTS OF TWO

03:24:36.130 --> 03:24:37.898
PROPOSALS THE MOST NOTABLE ISSUE

03:24:37.965 --> 03:24:39.000
IS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND

03:24:39.066 --> 03:24:41.068

SPECIFICITY CONCERNING?

03:24:56.317 --> 03:24:57.485
HOW THE STATE WOULD MEASURE THE

NEED FOR IMPROVED CONNECTIVITY

03:24:59.387 --> 03:25:00.788

03:25:02.490 --> 03:25:03.758
CONNECTIVITY?

03:25:03.824 --> 03:25:04.859

03:25:39.927 --> 03:25:41.328
TO ALIGN WITH THE FEDERAL GRANTS

03:25:41.395 --> 03:25:42.763
AND AVAILABLE FUNDING.

03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:43.831
THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WOULD

03:25:43.898 --> 03:25:45.299
REDUCE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FOR

03:25:45.366 --> 03:25:46.634
HOMELESS STUDENT SERVICES IN

03:25:46.701 --> 03:25:48.536
ORDER TO FIND THREE ADDITIONAL

STATEWIDE COULDN'T COORDINATORS

03:25:50.638 --> 03:25:52.740
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS.

03:25:52.807 --> 03:25:54.108
ONE WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE

03:25:54.175 --> 03:25:55.710
TO CONSIDER WHETHER THESE FUNDS

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:57.945
ARE BEST BET AUGMENTING LOCAL OP

03:25:58.012 --> 03:26:02.817
ASSISTANCE OR STATE OPERATIONS

03:26:02.883 --> 03:26:05.186
THANK YOU.

03:26:05.252 --> 03:26:05.820
THANK YOU MISS FRICTION OF ALL

03:26:05.886 --> 03:26:06.654
SAY JUST VERY BRIEFLY ON THE

03:26:06.721 --> 03:26:07.321
BROADBAND AT THAT IS A IMPORTANT

03:26:07.388 --> 03:26:08.255
PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND

03:26:08.322 --> 03:26:09.757
REALLY FOCUSED ON RESOURCES THAT.

03:26:09.824 --> 03:26:10.958
DO NOT SIMPLY ALLOW FOR COMPUTER

03:26:11.025 --> 03:26:13.561
BASED ASSESSMENTS BUT ACTUAL.

03:26:13.627 --> 03:26:14.929
GIVING MORE ACCESS TO DIGITAL

03:26:14.995 --> 03:26:15.529
LEARNING SO WE THINK THIS IS

03:26:15.596 --> 03:26:17.198
IMPORTANT OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS

03:26:17.264 --> 03:26:18.766
ON THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT BUT

03:26:18.833 --> 03:26:21.402
WE BELIEVE THAT FIFTY MILLION

03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:25.072
DOLLARS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY.

03:26:25.139 --> 03:26:27.575
QUESTION FOR MEMBERS.

03:26:27.641 --> 03:26:28.142
THOROUGH.

03:26:28.209 --> 03:26:29.910
WITH RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND

03:26:29.977 --> 03:26:31.612
INFRASTRUCTURE I'M CERTAINLY

03:26:31.679 --> 03:26:32.813
NINE OF SUPPORTIVE OF MAKING

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:35.015
SURE SCHOOLS -- HAVE THAT SORT

03:26:35.082 --> 03:26:36.684
OF CONNECTIVITY WHAT DID WAS

03:26:36.751 --> 03:26:37.818
THERE ANY SORT OF ASSESSMENT AS

03:26:37.885 --> 03:26:39.887
TO WHAT THE NEED.

03:26:39.954 --> 03:26:43.124
WAS OR IS.

03:26:43.190 --> 03:26:44.658
YES SO SO THERE ARE -- A FEW

03:26:44.725 --> 03:26:46.026
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT

03:26:46.093 --> 03:26:49.830
HAVE LOOKED AT WHAT THE THE

03:26:49.897 --> 03:26:51.332
DIFFERENT A SCHOOL DISTRICT

03:26:51.398 --> 03:26:53.200
ABILITIES TO ACCESS WHAT WOULD

03:26:53.267 --> 03:26:54.568
PUT ONE COULD CONSIDER HIGH

03:26:54.635 --> 03:26:55.669
SPEED INTERNET ARE ACROSS THE

03:26:55.736 --> 03:26:56.971
STATE AND IT REALLY.

03:26:57.037 --> 03:26:59.940
DEPENDS UPON HOW YOU DEFINE --

03:27:00.007 --> 03:27:02.009
WHAT HIGH SPEED IS -- WE KNOW

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:04.278
THAT FOR MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS

03:27:04.345 --> 03:27:05.546
WE RECENTLY HAD YOU KNOW FUNDING

03:27:05.613 --> 03:27:08.215
GO OUT THROUGH OUR BIG PROGRAM

03:27:08.282 --> 03:27:09.717
BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM --

03:27:09.784 --> 03:27:10.618
THAT WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

03:27:10.684 --> 03:27:12.019
ENSURING THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

03:27:12.086 --> 03:27:14.555
COULD ADMINISTER THE THE ASPECT

03:27:14.622 --> 03:27:16.223
THAT THE COMPUTER BASED

03:27:16.290 --> 03:27:17.858
ASSESSMENTS OUR STATE -- AND WE

03:27:17.925 --> 03:27:19.760
KNOW FROM THAT WORK THAT THERE

03:27:19.827 --> 03:27:23.164
ARE MANY WHO HAD -- AS TEMPORARY

03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:26.033
SOLUTIONS PUT IN PLACE TO ACCESS --

03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:27.334
THE INTERNET AT A SPEED THAT A

03:27:27.401 --> 03:27:28.936
LOT FOR THOSE ASSESSMENTS -- BUT

03:27:29.003 --> 03:27:30.471
THAT THERE IS SOME NEED TO GO

03:27:30.538 --> 03:27:31.405
BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE AGAIN AND

03:27:31.472 --> 03:27:33.507
SEE IF -- AN OPTION LIKE FIBER

03:27:33.574 --> 03:27:34.441
COULD BE IS THE REASON I BRING

03:27:34.508 --> 03:27:37.011
UP FIBERS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR

03:27:37.077 --> 03:27:39.647
SCALING UP OF INTERNET SPEED --

03:27:39.713 --> 03:27:42.783
AS AS CAPACITY GROWS -- I THINK

03:27:42.850 --> 03:27:46.020
WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN -- AT

03:27:46.086 --> 03:27:47.855
ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT -- YOU

03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:49.356
KNOW DEPENDING AGAIN ON WHICH

03:27:49.423 --> 03:27:50.858
MEASURE YOU LOOK AT AND THERE

03:27:50.925 --> 03:27:51.659
ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

03:27:51.725 --> 03:27:54.628
VERY LOW ACCESS SPEEDS -- IN

03:27:54.695 --> 03:27:56.096
COMPARISON TO OTHER DISTRICTS

03:27:56.163 --> 03:27:57.665
AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT LIMITS A

03:27:57.731 --> 03:27:59.633
STUDENT'S ABILITY -- TO TO

03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:01.435
ACCESS OR DIGITAL LEARNING TYPE

03:28:01.502 --> 03:28:02.970
pOF ENVIRONMENT AS OPPOSED TO

03:28:03.037 --> 03:28:08.843
JUST HAVING ACCESS TO THE STATE

03:28:08.909 --> 03:28:11.478
ASSESSMENTS.

03:28:11.545 --> 03:28:12.413
IS THE REASON I ASK MY QUESTION

03:28:12.479 --> 03:28:13.347
IS OF YOU KNOW WHY FIFTEEN

03:28:13.414 --> 03:28:14.114
MILLION IS SUPPOSED TO THIRTY

03:28:14.181 --> 03:28:15.382
WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE

03:28:15.449 --> 03:28:16.650
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IF IF IT'S

03:28:16.717 --> 03:28:18.385
IMPORTANT TO US AND TO THE

03:28:18.452 --> 03:28:20.054
ASSEMBLY US ON THE SENATE SIDE

03:28:20.120 --> 03:28:21.889
THE ASSEMBLY. TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:28:21.956 --> 03:28:24.325
SCHOOLS ARE HAVE CONNECTIITY.

03:28:24.391 --> 03:28:25.826
AND IT'S A ONE HUNDRED MILLION

03:28:25.893 --> 03:28:27.428
DOLLAR PROBLEM THEN MAYBE WE

03:28:27.494 --> 03:28:29.496
NEED TO FIND ONE HUNDRED MILLION

03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:31.298
DOLLARS AND FIX THE PROBLEM.

03:28:31.365 --> 03:28:32.766
I'M JUST TRYING.

03:28:32.833 --> 03:28:35.569
TO UNDERSTAND FIFTEEN THE REGIS

03:28:35.636 --> 03:28:37.671
PICK A NUMBER OR WAS IT BASED ON

03:28:37.738 --> 03:28:40.341
SOME.

03:28:40.407 --> 03:28:41.442
ECHO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE END

03:28:41.508 --> 03:28:44.778
HERE. FOR YES THE QUESTION HOW

03:28:44.845 --> 03:28:47.081
DID WE GET -- TO FIFTEEN THERE

03:28:47.147 --> 03:28:48.515
IS NO SECRET IN THE SAUCE ON

03:28:48.582 --> 03:28:49.783
THIS ONE I THINK WHAT WE'RE

03:28:49.850 --> 03:28:51.418
LOOKING AT THIS AS HIS INITIAL

03:28:51.485 --> 03:28:52.753
INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF

03:28:52.820 --> 03:28:54.455
THE THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE

03:28:54.521 --> 03:28:55.789
FARTHEST BEHIND.

03:28:55.856 --> 03:28:57.524

THROUGHOUT FIRST ALL OUR SCHOOL

03:29:04.865 --> 03:29:07.534

WHAT I GUESS IT DEPENDS?

03:33:04.271 --> 03:33:05.706
ON A MONTH PERSPECTIVE I THINK

03:33:05.772 --> 03:33:07.007
IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE LAST

03:33:07.074 --> 03:33:07.608

MAKES TO POLICY CHANGES ONE IS

03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:34.394
TO CALCULATE THAT PORTION BASED

ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE

03:39:35.862 --> 03:39:37.464
JUST TWO NOW COMES TO SMOOTH OUT

THE COSTS.

03:39:38.798 --> 03:39:41.101
AND THEN SECOND -- PROVIDED

OF FUNDING FORMULA RATES OF THAT

03:40:03.890 --> 03:40:05.525
MOVING FORWARD ONLY 10% OF THE

03:40:05.592 --> 03:40:06.927
FORMULA WOULD.

03:40:06.993 --> 03:40:09.362
BE BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES --

03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:10.597

PERSONAL FORMULA THE ASSEMBLY

03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:21.675
THE KEY CHANGES.

03:40:21.741 --> 03:40:22.542
TO LOCK IN PLACE THE PORTION THE

03:40:22.609 --> 03:40:24.010
FRONT OF THE FUNDING FORMULA

03:40:24.077 --> 03:40:25.845
BASED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES.

03:40:25.912 --> 03:40:27.581

WITH SOME OF THE DATA BY --

03:40:33.153 --> 03:40:36.089
CREATING A MUCH MUCH MORE -- A

03:40:36.156 --> 03:40:37.390
SMOOTHER BUT YOUR YOUR CHANGE IN

03:40:37.457 --> 03:40:39.125
THAT IN FUNDING BY USING A THREE

03:40:39.192 --> 03:40:40.093
YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE.

03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:41.394
AND BY USING ONLY THE HIGHEST

03:40:41.461 --> 03:40:43.029
DEGREE EARNED WOULD AVOID SOME

03:40:43.096 --> 03:40:44.464
OF THE CONCERNS THAT FROM --

03:40:44.531 --> 03:40:45.565

ONLY AT ONE POINT WHICH IS THAT

03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:58.778

WE BELIEVE IN A REVISION IS THE

03:41:04.017 --> 03:41:05.151
BEST APPROACH.

03:41:05.218 --> 03:41:09.789

ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN ONE TIME

03:41:35.482 --> 03:41:37.384
FUNDING THAT COULD BE SPENT OVER

03:41:37.450 --> 03:41:38.284
SEVEN YEARS.

03:41:38.351 --> 03:41:40.320
AND IN ADDITION WAS OPERATE WITH

03:41:40.387 --> 03:41:41.755
TWENTY MILLION THAT IT WOULD

03:41:41.821 --> 03:41:43.023
RECEIVE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

03:41:43.089 --> 03:41:45.659
THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IS. TO TWO

03:41:45.725 --> 03:41:46.993
PIECES FIRST IT'S TO REDUCE THE

ONGOING FUNDING ABOUT FROM

03:41:49.562 --> 03:41:51.097
TWENTY MILLION TO FIVE MILLION.

03:41:51.164 --> 03:41:52.265
AND THEN IT WOULD BE TOOK THE

03:41:52.332 --> 03:41:54.100
SECOND OPTION WOULD BE TO TAKE

03:41:54.167 --> 03:41:55.035
FIFTY MILLION OF THE HUNDRED

03:41:55.101 --> 03:41:56.636
MILLION PROVIDED A ONE TIME

03:41:56.703 --> 03:42:01.641
FUNDING LAST YEAR -- AND USE IT

03:42:01.708 --> 03:42:02.208
FOR OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:42:02.275 --> 03:42:03.476
PURPOSES.

03:42:03.543 --> 03:42:04.678
AND I'LL ADD THAT DAIS ONLINE

03:42:04.744 --> 03:42:05.445
COLLEGES RAMPING UP ITS

03:42:05.512 --> 03:42:06.780
OPERATIONS IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN

03:42:06.846 --> 03:42:07.681
ENROLLING STUDENTS THIS FALL SO

03:42:07.747 --> 03:42:08.915
THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES THAT WE

03:42:08.982 --> 03:42:10.517
SHOULD NOT BE REDUCING FUNDING

03:42:10.583 --> 03:42:12.686
AT THIS TIME.

03:42:12.752 --> 03:42:14.788
THANK YOU IN THE QUESTIONS OR

03:42:14.854 --> 03:42:15.889
COMMENTS [inaudible]

03:42:15.955 --> 03:42:17.457
THOROUGH.

03:42:17.524 --> 03:42:18.825
BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT

03:42:18.892 --> 03:42:20.126
WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF

03:42:20.193 --> 03:42:21.861
FIFTH OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE

03:42:21.928 --> 03:42:24.698
TIME WAS TO BE USED FOR START UP

03:42:24.764 --> 03:42:26.399
OVER SIXTY SEVEN YEARS. SEVEN

03:42:26.466 --> 03:42:28.501
YEARS WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT

03:42:28.568 --> 03:42:30.437
OF TAKING FIFTY MILLION.

03:42:30.503 --> 03:42:33.473
AWAY FROM THAT OF BUCKET -- TO

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:35.475
USE FOR OTHER PURPOSES DURING

03:42:35.542 --> 03:42:37.110
THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR.

03:42:37.177 --> 03:42:38.712
PERHAPS WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF

03:42:38.778 --> 03:42:40.180
WHAT THE ONLINE COMMUNITY

03:42:40.246 --> 03:42:41.948
COLLEGES DOING.

03:42:42.015 --> 03:42:44.117
IN THE IN OUR RUN UP TO THE

03:42:44.184 --> 03:42:46.019
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET.

03:42:46.086 --> 03:42:47.721
AND MAKING FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS

03:42:47.787 --> 03:42:49.456
IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION YES AND

03:42:49.522 --> 03:42:50.557
WE DON'T SO IN TERMS OF THE

03:42:50.623 --> 03:42:51.891
SHORT TERM WE DON'T THINK THAT

03:42:51.958 --> 03:42:53.526
WOULD BE A LOT OF IMMEDIATE

03:42:53.593 --> 03:42:56.629
EFFECTS -- THE AND THE FOLKS FOR

03:42:56.696 --> 03:42:59.132
THE ONLY COMMITTEE CALLED

03:42:59.199 --> 03:43:00.834
PROVIDED SOME INFORMATION AND

03:43:00.900 --> 03:43:01.935
NONE OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING

03:43:02.001 --> 03:43:03.036
ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT I THINK WHEN

03:43:03.103 --> 03:43:04.270
WE ARE.

03:43:04.337 --> 03:43:05.171
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM IN MARCH --

03:43:05.238 --> 03:43:07.040
ARE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE

03:43:07.107 --> 03:43:08.241
LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS OF

03:43:08.308 --> 03:43:08.842
THE ONGOING FUNDING HAD BEEN

03:43:08.908 --> 03:43:09.809
SPENT.

03:43:09.876 --> 03:43:11.511
AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BAD

03:43:11.578 --> 03:43:13.113
LEVERAGE SOME OF PHILANTHROPY

03:43:13.179 --> 03:43:14.581
DOLLARS TO HAVE TO START SOME OF

03:43:14.647 --> 03:43:15.749
THESE ACTIVITIES SO THAT'S

03:43:15.815 --> 03:43:16.983
MOSTLY WHAT EXPENDITURES HAVE

03:43:17.050 --> 03:43:18.485
BEEN THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS

03:43:18.551 --> 03:43:19.853
AVAILABLE WE DON'T THINK IT HAS

03:43:19.919 --> 03:43:21.254
AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON THEIR ON

03:43:21.321 --> 03:43:23.189
THEIR ACTIVITIES.

03:43:23.256 --> 03:43:23.990
BUT THAT BEING SAID TO BE THEY

03:43:24.057 --> 03:43:24.891
ARE EXPECTED THEY WOULD HAVE

03:43:24.958 --> 03:43:27.193
THIS FUNDING FOR SEVEN YEARS AND

03:43:27.260 --> 03:43:28.962
IF YOU'RE REDUCING THAT AMOUNT

03:43:29.028 --> 03:43:29.662
AND HALF AND THAT DOES MEAN THAT

03:43:29.729 --> 03:43:30.897
THEY'RE LIKELY THEY WILL LIKELY

03:43:30.964 --> 03:43:32.132
NEED TO CHANGE WITH OUR LONG

03:43:32.198 --> 03:43:34.134
TERM PLAN IS IN TERMS OF WHAT.

03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:34.734
WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE PILING ON

03:43:34.801 --> 03:43:35.368
SPENDING?

03:43:35.435 --> 03:43:36.870
AT THIS POINT WE HADN'T RECEIVED

03:43:36.936 --> 03:43:38.505
THE SPECIFIC DETAIL PLAN ON HOW

03:43:38.571 --> 03:43:39.405
THAT HUNDRED MILLION WAS TO BE

03:43:39.472 --> 03:43:40.774
SPENT WE CAN GIVE YOU ANY

03:43:40.840 --> 03:43:42.842
SPECIFICITY IN TERMS OF WITH

03:43:42.909 --> 03:43:43.443
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES WOULD BE

03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:48.047
REMOVED.

03:43:48.114 --> 03:43:49.549
BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE.

03:43:49.616 --> 03:43:50.717
THERE ARE THREE ONLINE COLLEGE

03:43:50.784 --> 03:43:53.019
pGOING TO ROLL OUT.

03:43:53.086 --> 03:43:55.355
IN AUGUST WITH CLASSES BEGINNING

03:43:55.421 --> 03:43:58.224
IN OCTOBER I GATHER THEN THAT

03:43:58.291 --> 03:44:01.161
REDUCING THE ONE TIME BUCKET

03:44:01.227 --> 03:44:02.929
FROM A HUNDRED TO FIFTY MILLION

03:44:02.996 --> 03:44:04.264
IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO IMPACT

03:44:04.330 --> 03:44:06.699
THOSE THREE ONLINE PROGRAMS.

03:44:06.766 --> 03:44:08.301
THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE OUR

03:44:08.368 --> 03:44:09.636
THAT WOULD BE OUR EXPECTATION IT

03:44:09.702 --> 03:44:10.470
IS MOVING FORWARD AT OTHER

03:44:10.537 --> 03:44:11.938
PROGRAMS RAMPING UP WITH THE

03:44:12.005 --> 03:44:12.839
CHANGES WOULD BE.

03:44:12.906 --> 03:44:16.609
DID DID THEY DID THE ONLINE.

03:44:16.676 --> 03:44:17.577
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

03:44:17.644 --> 03:44:18.945
ADMINISTRATORS GIVE YOU ANY IDEA

03:44:19.012 --> 03:44:21.014
OF WHAT THEY EARN NEXT WITH THE

03:44:21.080 --> 03:44:22.482
FOLLOW UP PLANS ARE FOLLOWING

03:44:22.549 --> 03:44:25.819
PLANS ARE FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS.

03:44:25.885 --> 03:44:27.320
GIVE ME IN REGARDS TO THE THE

03:44:27.387 --> 03:44:28.621
REDUCTION OF THE FIFTY NINE

03:44:28.688 --> 03:44:29.656
DOLLAR NO BEYOND THE THREE

03:44:29.722 --> 03:44:31.057
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE APPARENTLY

03:44:31.124 --> 03:44:34.694
GOING TO START IN OCTOBER AMMAR.

03:44:34.761 --> 03:44:36.196
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF IT SPECIFIC

03:44:36.262 --> 03:44:37.463
I KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN --

03:44:37.530 --> 03:44:38.231
LOOKING INTO POTENTIAL WHAT

03:44:38.298 --> 03:44:39.098
THROUGH THOSE OTHER PATHWAYS

03:44:39.165 --> 03:44:39.933
WOULD BE I KNOW THAT THEY ARE

03:44:39.999 --> 03:44:41.968
EXPECTED TO I BELIEVE GET TO UP

03:44:42.035 --> 03:44:42.635
TO TEN PATHWAYS THAT THEY WOULD

03:44:42.702 --> 03:44:47.207
BE DEVELOPING -- BUT WE HAVE NOT

03:44:47.273 --> 03:44:48.942
HEARD OF ANY SPECIFIC.

03:44:49.008 --> 03:44:49.976
JUST THAT THEY ARE STILL LOOKING

03:44:50.043 --> 03:44:50.910
INTO WHAT UP WITH THOSE PAST

03:44:50.977 --> 03:44:51.544
MIGHT BE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE

03:44:51.611 --> 03:44:52.378
BEST.

03:44:52.445 --> 03:44:53.213
OPTIONS THAT MIGHT THAT THEY

03:44:53.279 --> 03:44:54.347
COULD CONNECT EMPLOYERS IN THIS

03:44:54.414 --> 03:44:55.648
INSTANCE WITH.

03:44:55.715 --> 03:44:57.317
AND MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS FERGUSON

03:44:57.383 --> 03:44:58.017
HAS SOME COMMENTS AS WELL

03:44:58.084 --> 03:44:59.118
CERTAINLY I THINK WHAT YOU WOULD

03:44:59.185 --> 03:44:59.919
EXPECT IF YOU WERE TO REDUCE

03:44:59.986 --> 03:45:00.887
THAT FIFTY MILLION IT STARTS TO

03:45:00.954 --> 03:45:01.688
CHANGE.

03:45:01.754 --> 03:45:03.590
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STUDENT

03:45:03.656 --> 03:45:04.657
SUPPORT SERVICE TOOL FOR WILL BE

03:45:04.724 --> 03:45:06.092
WOULD BE CREATED AND PROVIDED TO

03:45:06.159 --> 03:45:07.260
THE STUDENTS.

03:45:07.327 --> 03:45:08.828
IT WOULD IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT

03:45:08.895 --> 03:45:11.397
OF ADDITIONAL -- PATHWAYS MOVING

03:45:11.464 --> 03:45:13.833
FORWARD SO CERTAINLY I THINK.

03:45:13.900 --> 03:45:15.768
YOU KNOW I JUST LIKE TO TAKE IT

03:45:15.835 --> 03:45:17.270
BACK TO REALLY THE UP THE

03:45:17.337 --> 03:45:18.872
FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THE

03:45:18.938 --> 03:45:20.306
ONLINE COLLEGE AND THAT IS WE

03:45:20.373 --> 03:45:21.274
KNOW THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

03:45:21.341 --> 03:45:23.610
AMOUNT OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE

03:45:23.676 --> 03:45:24.911
SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE.

03:45:24.978 --> 03:45:26.846
IT'S IN THE MILLIONS WE KNOW

03:45:26.913 --> 03:45:28.481
THAT THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM

03:45:28.548 --> 03:45:30.817
THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- AND

03:45:30.884 --> 03:45:32.218
OUR GOAL IS TO TRY AND IMPROVE

03:45:32.285 --> 03:45:33.953
ECONOMIC MOBILITY THROUGH THESE

03:45:34.020 --> 03:45:35.588
PROGRAMS SO TO THE EXTENT YOU

03:45:35.655 --> 03:45:36.189
WERE.

03:45:36.256 --> 03:45:37.523
TO PRODUCE FOR RE DIRECT THOSE

03:45:37.590 --> 03:45:39.792
RESOURCES TOWARDS OTHER PURPOSES --

03:45:39.859 --> 03:45:44.097
IT WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERMINE

03:45:44.163 --> 03:45:45.465
THAT BROUGHT GOAL.

03:45:45.531 --> 03:45:46.699
WELL I MEAN MY GUESS THE REASON

03:45:46.766 --> 03:45:48.034
I'M ASKED WE SENATE HAD NO

03:45:48.101 --> 03:45:48.568
PROPOSAL ON THIS BUT I'M.

03:45:48.635 --> 03:45:49.435
REVIEWING THE ASSEMBLY IS

03:45:49.502 --> 03:45:50.703
PROPOSAL AND I'M TRYING. TO TO

03:45:50.770 --> 03:45:52.772
SORT OF NOODLE THIS OUT -- THIS

03:45:52.839 --> 03:45:53.273
ONE HUNDRED MILLION WAS

03:45:53.339 --> 03:45:54.674
APPROPRIATED IN THE LAST BUDGET

03:45:54.741 --> 03:45:55.808
PROCESS.

03:45:55.875 --> 03:45:58.878
AND IF ONE MILLION OF THE ONE

03:45:58.945 --> 03:46:00.580
HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT --

03:46:00.647 --> 03:46:02.148
AND WE'RE MOVING INTO THE NEXT

03:46:02.215 --> 03:46:03.483
BUDGET YEAR.

03:46:03.549 --> 03:46:04.584
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE PRETTY

03:46:04.651 --> 03:46:06.686
QUICKLY AND INCREASED THE BURN

03:46:06.753 --> 03:46:07.687
RATE.

03:46:07.754 --> 03:46:09.155
BETTER PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RATE

03:46:09.222 --> 03:46:10.823
OF TO TO BURN THROUGH FIFTY

03:46:10.890 --> 03:46:12.225
MILLION LET ALONE ONE HUNDRED

03:46:12.292 --> 03:46:13.726
MILLION IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR

03:46:13.793 --> 03:46:15.028
AND OF COURSE BUDGET.

03:46:15.094 --> 03:46:16.296
BEING OF MATTER BALANCING

03:46:16.362 --> 03:46:17.997
PRIORITIES WHICH YOU WILL DO ALL

03:46:18.064 --> 03:46:20.667
THE TIME AND WE TRY TO PLAY IN

03:46:20.733 --> 03:46:21.501
THAT GAME.

03:46:21.567 --> 03:46:23.336
OF IF THERE'S ANOTHER USE FOR

03:46:23.403 --> 03:46:24.837
THE MONEY TEMPORARILY WE MADE I

03:46:24.904 --> 03:46:26.773
WANT TO PUT THAT TO A DIFFERENT

03:46:26.839 --> 03:46:28.374
USE.

03:46:28.441 --> 03:46:29.976
I THINK I I UNDERSTAND WHERE

03:46:30.043 --> 03:46:30.810
YOU'RE COMING FROM A NOTE THAT

03:46:30.877 --> 03:46:33.079
THE ONLINE COLLEGES BUDGET WAS

03:46:33.146 --> 03:46:37.417
RECENTLY -- TAKEN BEFORE THE THE

03:46:37.483 --> 03:46:38.885
ONLINE CULTURES BORDER YEAH I

03:46:38.952 --> 03:46:40.553
BELIEVE IT HAD BROOKLEY FORTY

03:46:40.620 --> 03:46:41.421
EIGHT MILLION AND PLANNED

03:46:41.487 --> 03:46:42.655
EXPENDITURES FOR THE UPCOMING

03:46:42.722 --> 03:46:44.457
YEAR SO THERE CERTAINLY WORKING

03:46:44.524 --> 03:46:45.925
TOWARDS EXPENDING THESE.

03:46:45.992 --> 03:46:47.527
RESOURCES I THINK I WOULD

03:46:47.593 --> 03:46:49.696
APPLAUD THEM IN BEING PRUDENT IN

03:46:49.762 --> 03:46:51.431
THEIR USE OF THESE RESOURCES --

03:46:51.497 --> 03:46:54.534
AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

03:46:54.600 --> 03:46:55.134
GETTING THE BEST VALUE FOR OUR

03:46:55.201 --> 03:46:56.469
DOLLAR.

03:46:56.536 --> 03:46:57.770
OKAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU

03:46:57.837 --> 03:46:59.739
VENTURE THANK YOU MISS SKINNER

03:46:59.806 --> 03:47:00.773
FOLLOWED BY MR TING.

03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:02.141
DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY THAT

03:47:02.208 --> 03:47:05.111
YOU JUST SAID THEY PLAN TO SPEND

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:07.113
FORTY EIGHT MILLION JUST NEXT

03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:10.583
YEAR. FOR MORE MONEY AFTER THE

03:47:10.650 --> 03:47:11.684
FOR YES SAID AT THE GOAL OF THAT

03:47:11.751 --> 03:47:14.420
IS BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING

03:47:14.487 --> 03:47:16.189
EXPENDITURES TO DEVELOP AND

03:47:16.255 --> 03:47:18.658
ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY. TO I

03:47:18.725 --> 03:47:19.993
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'VE ONLY

03:47:20.059 --> 03:47:21.661
ALRIGHT THIS WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED

03:47:21.728 --> 03:47:22.495
LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED MILLION

03:47:22.562 --> 03:47:24.364
ON YOU KNOW OVER THE SEVEN YEARS

03:47:24.430 --> 03:47:26.099
AND TWENTY MILLION OPERATIONAL

03:47:26.165 --> 03:47:27.867
IF THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND FORTY

03:47:27.934 --> 03:47:29.268
EIGHT MILLION OF IN ONE YEAR.

03:47:29.335 --> 03:47:31.270
THEN IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THEY'RE

03:47:31.337 --> 03:47:33.306
EXPECTING US TO GIVE THEM QUITE

03:47:33.373 --> 03:47:34.774
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY

03:47:34.841 --> 03:47:37.410
STARTING IN THE FOLLOWING FISCAL

03:47:37.477 --> 03:47:38.644
YEAR.

03:47:38.711 --> 03:47:40.880
BUT THAT SEEMS PRETTY BIG LEAP.

03:47:40.947 --> 03:47:41.714
WELL I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT

03:47:41.781 --> 03:47:44.283
IS ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER OF THE

03:47:44.350 --> 03:47:44.884
HUNDRED MILLION IN THE FIRST

03:47:44.951 --> 03:47:45.752
YEAR AND YOU WOULD.

03:47:45.818 --> 03:47:47.887
LIKE TO SEE THE BIGGEST EXPENSES

03:47:47.954 --> 03:47:54.127
IN THAT FIRST YEAR -- SO THE

03:47:54.193 --> 03:47:57.530
THIS PROGRAM OR RATHER.

03:47:57.597 --> 03:47:59.098
ONLINE COURSES WAS NOT

03:47:59.165 --> 03:48:01.601
CONTROVERSIAL.

03:48:01.667 --> 03:48:03.236
IN THE DISCUSSIONS.

03:48:03.302 --> 03:48:05.705
AROUND -- IN FACT MANY OF OUR

03:48:05.772 --> 03:48:07.373
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND

03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:08.908
DISTRICTS DO OFFER ONLINE

03:48:08.975 --> 03:48:10.510
COURSES AND THERE WAS A LOT OF

03:48:10.576 --> 03:48:14.213
SENTIMENT -- TO THAT THE

03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:15.815
LEGISLATURE SHOULD TAKE THE

03:48:15.882 --> 03:48:34.467
APPROACH OF SUPPORTING THE

03:49:03.663 --> 03:49:06.132
PROPOSAL POINTED OUT SUCH THINGS

03:49:06.199 --> 03:49:07.533
AS THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE

03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:09.335
ACCREDITATION OF THIS A

03:49:09.402 --> 03:49:13.739
CENTRALIZED ONLINE PROPOSAL --

03:49:13.806 --> 03:49:16.943
COLLEGE AND FOR YEARS AND THAT

03:49:17.009 --> 03:49:18.544
THERE WAS EXISTENCE OF THESE

03:49:18.611 --> 03:49:20.279
PROGRAMMES ELSEWHERE AND THERE

03:49:20.346 --> 03:49:23.416
COULD BE -- YOU KNOW WE COULD

03:49:23.483 --> 03:49:25.284
EITHER DISTRIBUTE -- FUNDS

03:49:25.351 --> 03:49:27.386
ACROSS THE STATE OR PICK CERTAIN

03:49:27.453 --> 03:49:30.790
REGIONS THAT YOU KNOW MY EITHER.

03:49:30.857 --> 03:49:33.259
HAVE MOST APPETITE FOR IT --

03:49:33.326 --> 03:49:34.894
HIGHEST NEED -- BUT THE

03:49:34.961 --> 03:49:36.329
ADMINISTRATION.

03:49:36.395 --> 03:49:38.531
WAS VERY -- SET.

03:49:38.598 --> 03:49:42.468
ON THIS PROPOSAL AND AS I

03:49:42.535 --> 03:49:44.070
INDICATE THERE WA A IT WAS VERY

03:49:44.137 --> 03:49:45.138
CONTROVERSIAL.

03:49:45.204 --> 03:49:48.341
AND SO I WONDER GIVEN THAT.

03:49:48.407 --> 03:49:51.410
THE THE PROGRAM IS ONLY SPENT

03:49:51.477 --> 03:49:52.378
HIS IS INDICATED.

03:49:52.445 --> 03:49:53.846
THAT.

03:49:53.913 --> 03:49:56.149
A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DATE

03:49:56.215 --> 03:49:57.450
AND EVEN IF THEY PLAN TO SPEND

03:49:57.517 --> 03:49:58.951
ANOTHER FORTY MILLION WHICH

03:49:59.018 --> 03:50:00.419
SEEMS PRETTY.

03:50:00.486 --> 03:50:02.155
DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE IN THE

03:50:02.221 --> 03:50:05.358
FIRST YEAR -- WHETHER WE ARE

03:50:05.424 --> 03:50:08.294
WISER RE VISITING THAT CONCEPT

03:50:08.361 --> 03:50:12.265
OF STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF

03:50:12.331 --> 03:50:13.733
OUR COMMUNITY CALL EXISTING

03:50:13.799 --> 03:50:15.434
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THAT

03:50:15.501 --> 03:50:17.236
HAPPENED PREDATION. TO BE ABLE

03:50:17.303 --> 03:50:20.907
TO PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES.

03:50:20.973 --> 03:50:23.910
END OF THESE PATHWAYS COULD NOT

03:50:23.976 --> 03:50:27.013
BE FULFILLED THROUGH THAT.

03:50:27.079 --> 03:50:28.147
SO I WOULD NOT THE LAST YEAR'S

03:50:28.214 --> 03:50:29.382
BUDGET DID INCLUDE SOME ONE TIME

03:50:29.448 --> 03:50:30.716
FUNDING I THINK GOES THROUGH THE

03:50:30.783 --> 03:50:31.450
ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE.

03:50:31.517 --> 03:50:33.186
THAT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE

03:50:33.252 --> 03:50:36.455
FUNDING -- THAT WOULD GO OUT ITS

03:50:36.522 --> 03:50:41.460
GRANTS -- TO THE FOR TRADITIONAL

03:50:41.527 --> 03:50:42.061
CAM YOU COLLEGES SO THAT THEY

03:50:42.128 --> 03:50:43.663
COULD DEVELOP THEM ONLINE

03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:45.064
PROGRAMS BUT THOSE PROGRAMS WE

03:50:45.131 --> 03:50:46.566
COULD POTENTIALLY ALIGNED WITH.

03:50:46.632 --> 03:50:47.934
SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE

03:50:48.000 --> 03:51:04.217
ONLINE COLLEGE

03:52:55.261 --> 03:52:56.028
EVEN IF THERE ISN'T

03:52:56.095 --> 03:52:58.197
AN ACCREDITATION -- OR AN

03:52:58.264 --> 03:52:59.465
ACCREDITATION AUTHORITY THAT HAS

03:52:59.532 --> 03:53:00.933
ACCREDITED THE PROGRAM THAT

03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:02.968
EMPLOYERS WILL I KNOW THE

03:53:03.035 --> 03:53:03.903
PROGRAM WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY

03:53:03.969 --> 03:53:06.305
WILL HAVE BUT THEY WILL BE --

03:53:06.372 --> 03:53:10.676
WILLING TO HIRE -- INDIVIDUALS

03:53:10.743 --> 03:53:12.244
TO COMPLETE THOSE PROGRAMS

03:53:12.311 --> 03:53:12.545
[inaudible]

03:53:12.611 --> 03:53:17.383
THE NIGHTMARE.

03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:19.318
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

03:53:19.385 --> 03:53:21.954

RECOMMENDATION THIS IS.

03:53:25.424 --> 03:53:29.128
THIS IS REALLY COOL -- THIS WAS

03:53:29.195 --> 03:53:31.030
A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ITEM LAST

03:53:31.097 --> 03:53:33.032
YEAR.

03:53:33.099 --> 03:53:35.401

PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY.

03:53:48.581 --> 03:53:52.985
TO GET THIS THING OFF THE GROUND --

03:53:53.052 --> 03:53:55.588
SERVICE ONE OF THE VINE AND THEN

03:53:55.654 --> 03:53:57.323
CHOOSE ME -- THE COMMUNITY

03:53:57.390 --> 03:54:01.060

03:54:21.380 --> 03:54:22.448
BENEFITS.

03:54:22.515 --> 03:54:24.183
AND I DOUBT THEY HAVE A PROGRAM

03:54:24.250 --> 03:54:25.217
TO START PAYING THAT DOWN LIKE

03:54:25.284 --> 03:54:28.988

03:54:34.293 --> 03:54:35.694
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUB TO

03:54:35.761 --> 03:54:37.163
NICKELS TOGETHER TO START.

03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:38.464
ATTACKING.

03:54:38.531 --> 03:54:40.533
THIS PROBLEM THIS FINANCIAL

03:54:40.599 --> 03:54:42.201
PROBLEMS LIKE I I SIT HERE I I

03:54:42.268 --> 03:54:44.069
SAY WHY DO WE START A NEW

03:54:44.136 --> 03:54:45.404
PROGRAM.

03:54:45.471 --> 03:54:47.072
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SEVENTY TWO

03:54:47.139 --> 03:54:50.242
AND A?

03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.843
SEVEN TWO SEVENTY ONE SEVENTY

03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:52.211
TWO DISTRICTS.

03:54:52.278 --> 03:54:52.778
HUNDRED FORTY FOUR CAMPUS I

03:54:52.845 --> 03:54:55.047
SHOULD AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE

03:54:55.114 --> 03:54:56.115
NUMBERS MEMORIES BUT WHY ARE WE

03:54:56.182 --> 03:54:57.249
DOING SOMETHING NEW AND

03:54:57.316 --> 03:54:58.350
INNOVATIVE IN EXPENSIVE WHEN

03:54:58.417 --> 03:55:00.453
WHEN WE'VE GOT.

03:55:00.519 --> 03:55:01.287
STAGGERING NUMBERS SOME

03:55:01.353 --> 03:55:05.157
STAGGERING NUMBERS TO LOOK AT

03:55:05.224 --> 03:55:06.892
AND SO IT KIND OF GIVES ME THAT

03:55:06.959 --> 03:55:11.330
LET'S GET REAL MOMENT.

03:55:11.397 --> 03:55:14.400
BY COULD STEAL A PHRASE -- BUT

03:55:14.467 --> 03:55:15.034
THE I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:16.735
FINANCE SHOULD REALLY REEVALUATE.

03:55:16.802 --> 03:55:18.404
THIS WHOLE ENDEAVOR.

03:55:18.471 --> 03:55:21.774
I'M.

03:55:21.841 --> 03:55:22.374
YOU ALREADY LOOKED AT A COUPLE

03:55:22.441 --> 03:55:23.509
OF OTHER.

03:55:23.576 --> 03:55:24.577
INITIATIVES BY OUR FORMER

03:55:24.643 --> 03:55:26.445
GOVERNOR A GOVERNOR BROWN AND I

03:55:26.512 --> 03:55:27.413
I THINK.

03:55:27.480 --> 03:55:28.614
HE WOULD DO THE CITIZENS A

03:55:28.681 --> 03:55:30.883
SERVICE BY TAKING A HARD LOOK AT

03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:32.618
THIS ONE AS WELL.

03:55:32.685 --> 03:55:35.421
THANK YOU MANAGER.

03:55:35.488 --> 03:55:36.388
I'LL MAKE YOU VERY -- BRIEF

03:55:36.455 --> 03:55:38.891
COMMENTS -- AND DON'T WHATEVER

03:55:38.958 --> 03:55:39.558
HURTS THE DEBATE THAT I KNOW ALL

03:55:39.625 --> 03:55:40.793
THE PARTS SPENT LAST YEAR BUT

03:55:40.860 --> 03:55:42.127
JUST TWO QUICK THINGS I THINK.

03:55:42.194 --> 03:55:44.697
FIRST IS THAT -- FOR SAYS WITH

03:55:44.763 --> 03:55:46.398
GOVERNOR BROWN THIS PROPOSAL WAS

03:55:46.465 --> 03:55:47.800
SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT

03:55:47.867 --> 03:55:49.969
INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORK FORCE

03:55:50.035 --> 03:55:51.537
YOU DON'T HAVE A CREDENTIAL AND

03:55:51.604 --> 03:55:53.606
WHO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT

03:55:53.672 --> 03:55:54.507
I KNOW YOU'VE DISCUSSED OF MIND

03:55:54.573 --> 03:55:56.008
ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS

03:55:56.075 --> 03:55:58.677
OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO WE DIED --

03:55:58.744 --> 03:56:00.112
I GUESS GOVERNOR BROWN DODD AND

03:56:00.179 --> 03:56:02.114
GOT THIRTY SOME AGREES -- WE TO

03:56:02.181 --> 03:56:03.015
FIND ANOTHER WAY TO REACH THEM --

03:56:03.082 --> 03:56:04.383
AND THEN THE SECOND POINT TO

03:56:04.450 --> 03:56:06.552
YOUR POINT ABOUT COST PRESSURES

03:56:06.619 --> 03:56:08.654
IS THAT ANY NEW INITIATIVE

03:56:08.721 --> 03:56:10.956
REQUIRES SOME START UP COSTS BUT

03:56:11.023 --> 03:56:12.858
WE BELIEVE THAT INITIATIVE LIKE

03:56:12.925 --> 03:56:13.058
THIS.

03:56:13.125 --> 03:56:14.293
IF RUN WHILE WILL SERVE THE

03:56:14.360 --> 03:56:17.630
STUDENTS POSSIBLY AT A LOWER

03:56:17.696 --> 03:56:19.899
COST.

03:56:19.965 --> 03:56:21.300
AND I I I UNDERSTAND IT'S A

03:56:21.367 --> 03:56:22.535
NOBLE CONCEPT.

03:56:22.601 --> 03:56:24.403
NOBLE CAUSE.

03:56:24.470 --> 03:56:25.504
BUT I I'M NOT GOING TO BUY MY

03:56:25.571 --> 03:56:26.105
WIFE A DIAMOND RING WHEN I'VE

03:56:26.171 --> 03:56:27.473
GOT. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:56:27.540 --> 03:56:39.285
DOLLARS IN CREDIT CARD DEBT.

03:56:39.351 --> 03:56:41.153
A LITTLE MORE DEAD COME ON NOW.

03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:42.254
I'M JUST SAYING I'M JUST SAYING

03:56:42.321 --> 03:56:45.291
IN.

03:56:45.357 --> 03:56:47.459
IF IF IF OUR HOUSE ISN'T IN

03:56:47.526 --> 03:56:53.866
ORDER. ONE GRADUAL LIKE THAT --

03:56:53.933 --> 03:56:55.601
YEAH.

03:56:57.770 --> 03:56:59.271
THIRTY NINE YEARS BABY AND I

03:56:59.338 --> 03:57:03.642
HAVE BEEN REALLY BLESSED.

03:57:03.709 --> 03:57:05.044
THANK YOU KNOW THE POINT I'M

03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:06.745
TRYING TO MAKE AN THAT IS YOU

SIR AT THIS POINT THE COMMUNITY

03:57:57.096 --> 03:57:58.097
COLLEGES HAS BEEN A MILLION.

03:57:58.163 --> 03:58:00.265
AND IT'SONE MILLION OUT OF THE

03:58:00.332 --> 03:58:03.335
TWENTY MILLION ON GOING.

03:58:03.402 --> 03:58:04.703
THAT WAS THAT WAS OUR OUR

03:58:04.770 --> 03:58:05.671
UNDERSTANDING IT I THINK THIS

03:58:05.738 --> 03:58:07.706
INFORMATION IS FROM FROM MARCH

03:58:07.773 --> 03:58:09.508
OR APRIL SO IT'S OKAY IT COULD

03:58:09.575 --> 03:58:10.242
CHANGE THAT WAS OUR

03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:11.076
UNDERSTANDING AT THAT TIME BUT

03:58:11.143 --> 03:58:12.144
BUT ROUGHLY IN THE KNOWN AS OF

03:58:12.211 --> 03:58:13.779
MARCH OR APRIL IS A MILLION OUT

03:58:13.846 --> 03:58:14.780
OF THE TWENTY MILLION ON GOING.

03:58:14.847 --> 03:58:17.282
PLUS THERE IS THE OTHER.

03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:19.718
HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME.

03:58:19.785 --> 03:58:21.286
IS THAT CORRECT RESEARCH ONE

03:58:21.353 --> 03:58:22.655
MILLION OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND

03:58:22.721 --> 03:58:23.222
TWENTY NINE SO IT'S I GUESS

03:58:23.288 --> 03:58:24.757
GOING BACK.

03:58:24.823 --> 03:58:26.558
TO FINANCE WHY NOT.

03:58:26.625 --> 03:58:27.493
AGAIN.

03:58:27.559 --> 03:58:28.127
IF THE MONEY'S NOT GETTING SPEND

03:58:28.193 --> 03:58:28.360
WHY NT.

03:58:28.427 --> 03:58:29.762
SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY OR HALF

03:58:29.828 --> 03:58:31.730
THE MONEY THIS YEAR ANOTHER ONE

03:58:31.797 --> 03:58:32.598
TIME THINGS WE'VE LISTED OFF.

03:58:32.665 --> 03:58:34.299
DAD CAPITAL ITEMS THAT REALLY

03:58:34.366 --> 03:58:35.334
COULD BE USED INSTEAD OF KEEPING

03:58:35.401 --> 03:58:36.602
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES --

03:58:36.669 --> 03:58:38.637
BANK ACCOUNT SINCE.

03:58:38.704 --> 03:58:41.740
THEY THEY SAY THEY HAVE A PLAN

03:58:41.807 --> 03:58:43.342
BEEN BEEN FAIRLY.

03:58:43.409 --> 03:58:43.942
HAVE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

03:58:44.009 --> 03:58:46.712
EXECUTING.

03:58:46.779 --> 03:58:47.446
BUT I WOULD SAY IS THEY HAVE A

03:58:47.513 --> 03:58:48.881
PLAN TO RAMP UP AND THEY ARE

03:58:48.947 --> 03:58:49.548
RAMPING UP IN THEIR HIRING STAFF.

03:58:49.615 --> 03:58:50.382
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE MOVING DOWN

03:58:50.449 --> 03:58:51.817
THAT PATHWAY AND THAT TAKES TIME --

03:58:51.884 --> 03:58:52.751
BUT CERTAINLY I THINK.

03:58:52.818 --> 03:58:53.385
WE THINK THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE

03:58:53.452 --> 03:58:55.521
BEEN ALLOCATED WILL BE NECESSARY

03:58:55.587 --> 03:58:56.989
OVER THAT SEVEN YEAR PERIOD TO

03:58:57.056 --> 03:58:58.924
SUPPORT THE COLLEGE TO SUPPORT

03:58:58.991 --> 03:59:00.092
THE STUDENT.

03:59:00.159 --> 03:59:01.460
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S

03:59:01.527 --> 03:59:03.162
THAT GOAL RIGHT OF SERVING THOSE

03:59:03.228 --> 03:59:04.730
STUDENTS WHILE WE THINK THOSE

03:59:04.797 --> 03:59:06.665
RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO DO

03:59:06.732 --> 03:59:08.233
THAT.

03:59:08.300 --> 03:59:10.102
RIGHT BUT AS AS WOULD BE TYPICAL

03:59:10.169 --> 03:59:11.303
WE WOULD NOT.

03:59:11.370 --> 03:59:12.604
TRADITIONAL PREPARATION IS

03:59:12.671 --> 03:59:14.273
APPROPRIATIONS SPENT OVER TWO

03:59:14.339 --> 03:59:16.942
YEARS WE WE DON'T APPROPRIATE IN

03:59:17.009 --> 03:59:17.776
GENERAL UNLESS FOR DOING

03:59:17.843 --> 03:59:18.944
CONTAINS APPROPRIATION WITH THE

03:59:19.011 --> 03:59:20.379
IDEA THAT WE'RE SPENDING

03:59:20.446 --> 03:59:22.347
SOMETHING SEVEN YEARS.

03:59:22.414 --> 03:59:24.116
DOWN THE LINE SO WHY.

03:59:24.183 --> 03:59:28.287
WHY WHY IS IT SO IMPERATIVE? FOR

03:59:28.353 --> 03:59:29.788
HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION

03:59:29.855 --> 03:59:31.290
DOLLARS TO BE SITTING IN THE

03:59:31.356 --> 03:59:31.957
CHANCELLOR'S BANK ACCOUNT RATHER

03:59:32.024 --> 03:59:32.825
THAN.

03:59:32.891 --> 03:59:34.693
BEING USED BY THE STATE FOR DEBT

03:59:34.760 --> 03:59:35.761
REPAYMENTS ARE THE CAPITAL

03:59:35.828 --> 03:59:38.330
EXPENDITURES.

03:59:38.397 --> 03:59:40.399
AGAIN I THINK I JUST GO BACK --

03:59:40.466 --> 03:59:42.801
TO THEY WERE SET ASIDE TO WHAT

03:59:42.868 --> 03:59:44.536
THE A PLAN IN MIND TO EXPAND

03:59:44.603 --> 03:59:46.305
THEM ON THAT COLLEGE ON THE

03:59:46.371 --> 03:59:48.373
FRONT AND SO CERTAINLY IF WE'RE

03:59:48.440 --> 03:59:49.775
THINKING ABOUT BUDGET RESILIENCY

03:59:49.842 --> 03:59:52.377
BY HAVING THOSE PROGRAM TODAY --

03:59:52.444 --> 03:59:54.713
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE FUTURE

03:59:54.780 --> 03:59:56.582
EXPENSES PROGRAM TOMORROW.

03:59:56.648 --> 03:59:58.016
UNDERSTOOD THE JUST ECHOING MY

03:59:58.083 --> 04:00:00.619
PLACE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES THAT

04:00:00.686 --> 04:00:02.354
HAD DIFFICULT TIME.

04:00:02.421 --> 04:00:03.889
EXECUTING AND AND SPENDING THAT

04:00:03.956 --> 04:00:06.992
MONEY SO -- AT WHAT POINT DO WE

04:00:07.059 --> 04:00:10.863
SAY PERHAPS -- THESE ARE.

04:00:10.929 --> 04:00:12.431
NICE PLANS BUT THEY'RE NOT

04:00:12.498 --> 04:00:13.832
GETTING DONE AND WE WANT THE

04:00:13.899 --> 04:00:16.034
MONEY BACK BECAUSE WE WE JUST

04:00:16.101 --> 04:00:17.703
WENT THROUGH YOU KNOW THREE

04:00:17.770 --> 04:00:19.371
THREE PLUS HOURS ON K. TWELVE AN

04:00:19.438 --> 04:00:21.440
AFTER SCHOOL AND WE STARTED WITH

04:00:21.507 --> 04:00:24.042
THE VERVIEW AND THE DDS.

04:00:24.109 --> 04:00:25.410
THE ITEM FROM CENTS FIFTY YOU

04:00:25.477 --> 04:00:27.112
KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF

04:00:27.179 --> 04:00:28.480
THINGS WHICH ARE.

04:00:28.547 --> 04:00:30.182
PRIORITIES RIGHT THESE ARE NOT

04:00:30.249 --> 04:00:30.816
THESE ARE NOT BECAUSE YOU KNOW

04:00:30.883 --> 04:00:31.383
SO.

04:00:31.450 --> 04:00:33.685
SO WHILE THE CHANCELLOR'S GOT A

04:00:33.752 --> 04:00:34.319
HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS

04:00:34.386 --> 04:00:35.687
IN HIS ACCOUNT WE'RE GONNA TELL

04:00:35.754 --> 04:00:37.222
SENIORS AND DISABLED FAMILIES

04:00:37.289 --> 04:00:41.760
SORRY WE'RE GONNA SUNSET YOUR

04:00:41.827 --> 04:00:44.429
SERVICES IN TWO YEARS.

04:00:44.496 --> 04:00:46.198
SO I THINK. TO THAT UP FRONT I

04:00:46.265 --> 04:00:46.665
THINK WE'D HAVE TO TO

04:00:46.732 --> 04:00:48.300
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PROPOSITION

04:00:48.367 --> 04:00:49.368
NINETY EIGHT AND NON PROPOSITION

04:00:49.434 --> 04:00:50.202
I NAY TO THESE ARE WITHIN THE

04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:51.336
GUARANTEED TO CERTAINLY THEY

04:00:51.403 --> 04:00:51.737
COULDN'T SUPPORT.

04:00:51.804 --> 04:00:53.438
ON THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS -- BUT

04:00:53.505 --> 04:00:55.174
WE DO HAVE A A PLAN THAT THE

04:00:55.240 --> 04:00:57.509
ONLINE COLLEGE HAS HE PLANNED TO

04:00:57.576 --> 04:00:58.811
SPEND THOSE RESOURCES IN SUPPORT

04:00:58.877 --> 04:01:01.647
OF STUDENTS TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS --

04:01:01.713 --> 04:01:03.482
AND TO SEE THAT THOSE STUDENTS

04:01:03.549 --> 04:01:05.050
ARE ABLE TO IMPROVE THEIR

04:01:05.117 --> 04:01:07.653
ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR FORGET TO

04:01:07.719 --> 04:01:08.420
WRITE THANKS FOR THE

04:01:08.487 --> 04:01:09.888
CLARIFICATION PROP NINETY IS

04:01:09.955 --> 04:01:11.256
HALL ALL SWITCHED ANALOGY SO.

04:01:11.323 --> 04:01:12.057
RIGHT NOW AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE

04:01:12.124 --> 04:01:14.793
DOUBLED EDUCATION SPENDING FROM

04:01:14.860 --> 04:01:16.228
FORTY BILLION TO EIGHTY BILLION --

04:01:16.295 --> 04:01:19.431
WE HAD THREE MAJOR SCHOOL

04:01:19.498 --> 04:01:20.499
DISTRICTS GO ON STRIKE.

04:01:20.566 --> 04:01:21.700
WE HAVE ANOTHER THREATENING TO

04:01:21.767 --> 04:01:24.803
GO ON STRIKE WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW

04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:26.271
HOW LAST COUNT ROUGHLY HALF HAVE

04:01:26.338 --> 04:01:31.710
TO DISTRICTS IN THE STATE.

04:01:31.777 --> 04:01:33.612
CONCERNED WHY WHY ARE WE SITTING

04:01:33.679 --> 04:01:34.780
ON THIS MONEY AND HAVING IT IN

04:01:34.847 --> 04:01:35.647
THE BANK ACCOUNT RATHER THAN.

04:01:35.714 --> 04:01:36.582
PUTTING IT IN CAL STARS PUTTING

04:01:36.648 --> 04:01:37.716
ANY CALPERS DOING SOMETHING THAT

04:01:37.783 --> 04:01:38.717
COULD REALLY.

04:01:38.784 --> 04:01:40.352
ASSIST THESE -- DISTRICTS.

04:01:40.419 --> 04:01:42.221
SO I THINK -- THE KEY POINT IS

04:01:42.287 --> 04:01:43.255
THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:01:43.322 --> 04:01:44.690
SPEND THIS MONEY UNLESS THERE IS

04:01:44.756 --> 04:01:46.458
A SHARP SHIFT IN DIRECTION ON

04:01:46.525 --> 04:01:48.360
THIS COLLEGE IT IS PART OF OUR

04:01:48.427 --> 04:01:49.728
PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE IT'S

04:01:49.795 --> 04:01:51.864
PART OF THE CAPITAL PLAN.

04:01:51.930 --> 04:01:53.498
SO -- AND THE MONEY IS SITTING

04:01:53.565 --> 04:01:54.132
THERE BUT IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW

04:01:54.199 --> 04:01:55.467
WITH LIKE YOU MENTIONED A NUMBER

04:01:55.534 --> 04:01:57.269
OF EXPENDITURES -- OFTEN TAKE A

04:01:57.336 --> 04:01:58.737
COUPLE OF YEARS DEPENDING ON

04:01:58.804 --> 04:01:59.671
LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNOR

04:01:59.738 --> 04:02:01.740
DIRECTION SO -- YOU KNOW IF IF

04:02:01.807 --> 04:02:03.876
IF THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO BE

04:02:03.942 --> 04:02:05.077
RENEGOTIATING SUMS ARE MORE

04:02:05.143 --> 04:02:06.511
SIGNIFICANT WAY IF WE'RE NOT

04:02:06.578 --> 04:02:08.180
ACTUALLY GOING FORWARD THAT'S A

04:02:08.247 --> 04:02:09.281
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

04:02:09.348 --> 04:02:10.749
BUT WITH WITH THE PROJECT GOING

04:02:10.816 --> 04:02:12.117
FORWARD WE DID WANT TO SET ASIDE

04:02:12.184 --> 04:02:14.052
THIS MONEY IT IS ONE TIME MONEY

04:02:14.119 --> 04:02:15.587
IT IS FOR START UP COSTS THIS IS

04:02:15.654 --> 04:02:16.555
A NEW INITIATIVE.

04:02:16.622 --> 04:02:18.190
SO WE THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO

04:02:18.257 --> 04:02:19.825
PUT THAT ASIDE AND I BELIEVE I

04:02:19.892 --> 04:02:20.959
CAN CONFIRM WITH MY COLLEAGUES

04:02:21.026 --> 04:02:22.694
BUT IT IS PROBABLY EARNING MONEY

04:02:22.761 --> 04:02:28.934
ATTHE NORMAL BANK DEPOSIT RATE.

04:02:29.001 --> 04:02:32.137
WHICH IS WHAT.

04:02:32.204 --> 04:02:33.405
YOU KNOW THE MONIES CAN SPEND

04:02:33.472 --> 04:02:34.139
YOU AND I'LL CHECK ON THE NEXT

04:02:34.206 --> 04:02:35.941
PLANE GO TO VEGAS BECAUSE

04:02:36.008 --> 04:02:36.341
CLEARLY.

04:02:36.408 --> 04:02:38.944
IT'S I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT

04:02:39.011 --> 04:02:39.544
WILL CLEARLY IT'S NOT GETTING

04:02:39.611 --> 04:02:40.012
SPENT.

04:02:40.078 --> 04:02:42.447
AND AND CLEARLY WHATEVER PLAN IS

04:02:42.514 --> 04:02:45.484
BEING PUT TOGETHER.

04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:47.452
REALLY HAS AN AMOUNT TO HASN'T

04:02:47.519 --> 04:02:48.520
AMOUNTED TO VERY MUCH I THINK

04:02:48.587 --> 04:02:49.821
THAT'S THE CHALLENGES WHEN.

04:02:49.888 --> 04:02:52.391
THE THE CHANCELLOR THE NEW CEO'S

04:02:52.457 --> 04:02:55.193
BUT HOUSE FOR ARTICULATION OF

04:02:55.260 --> 04:02:59.831
PLANS IT'S NOT BEEN VERY CLEAR --

04:02:59.898 --> 04:03:01.400
NOT BEEN VERY CONVINCING SAID

04:03:01.466 --> 04:03:05.637
WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY WE TOOK IN

04:03:05.704 --> 04:03:07.606
ASSEMBLY ACTION THIS YEAR.

04:03:07.673 --> 04:03:07.906
AND GIVEN.

04:03:07.973 --> 04:03:08.941
THAT ARM WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

04:03:09.007 --> 04:03:10.075
PRIORITIES WE REALLY WOULD URGE

04:03:10.142 --> 04:03:11.376
ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE A HARDER

04:03:11.443 --> 04:03:12.611
LOOK AT REALLY WHAT DOES.

04:03:12.678 --> 04:03:14.413
THIS PROGRAM NEED IN THE NEXT

04:03:14.479 --> 04:03:15.280
YEAR TO WHICH I THINK MAKES

04:03:15.347 --> 04:03:17.482
SENSE WHAT REALISTICALLY COULD

04:03:17.549 --> 04:03:19.151
BE SPENT AND AND FRANKLY THAN

04:03:19.217 --> 04:03:20.986
THE REST SHOULD BE.

04:03:21.053 --> 04:03:22.721

04:04:16.141 --> 04:04:17.876
THE DAY -- THAT THAT IS NOT THE

04:04:17.943 --> 04:04:19.544

COMMITTEE CALLS DISTRICT.

04:04:25.417 --> 04:04:26.485
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:04:26.551 --> 04:04:27.319
HAVE THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM IN

04:04:27.386 --> 04:04:28.353
OUT WHILE I WOULD LOVE TO SAY

04:04:28.420 --> 04:04:30.088
THISA LUXURY ITEM -- I DON'T

04:04:30.155 --> 04:04:31.556
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A LUXURY

04:04:31.623 --> 04:04:32.190
ITEM -- BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU

04:04:32.257 --> 04:04:34.192
THAT A FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP

WITH THE NETWORK NEVER HAD THE

04:04:35.660 --> 04:04:36.895
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO GO ON

04:04:36.962 --> 04:04:38.897
TO COLLEGE BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T

04:04:38.964 --> 04:04:39.965
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE

04:04:40.032 --> 04:04:41.800
ABLE TO GO AWAY BECAUSE THEY HAD.

04:04:41.867 --> 04:04:43.101
TO A TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND SO I

04:04:43.168 --> 04:04:45.137
FEAR I JUST FEAR THAT THE

04:04:45.203 --> 04:04:47.139

MONEY AS QUICKLY AS A NEED TO BE

04:05:15.233 --> 04:05:16.268
SPENDING MONEY THEY HAVEN'T --

04:05:16.334 --> 04:05:17.436
SUBMITTED PLANS LIKE THE NEED TO

WE'RE NOT PROVIDING FOR THEM AND

04:05:27.779 --> 04:05:31.850
THEY NEED TO GET ON WITH IT IF

04:05:31.917 --> 04:05:33.985
THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY.

04:05:34.052 --> 04:05:36.088

OBJECTION TO ONLINE COURSES AND

04:05:48.733 --> 04:05:50.435
I WANT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

04:05:50.502 --> 04:05:52.003
SYSTEM TO PROVIDE ONLINE COURSES

04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:53.638
AND I AM CONVINCED.

04:05:53.705 --> 04:05:55.974
THAT IT ABSOLUTELY IS A NEED

04:05:56.041 --> 04:05:57.943
BECAUSE WE HAVE MANY YOU'RE ONE

04:05:58.009 --> 04:05:59.678
OF THE DISADVANTAGES STILL OF

04:05:59.744 --> 04:06:00.879
OUR COMMUNICABLE **** IS

04:06:00.946 --> 04:06:03.281
ORIENTATION TOWARDS THE FULL

04:06:03.348 --> 04:06:04.616
TIME STUDENT.

04:06:04.683 --> 04:06:06.985
WHO IS AVAILABLE YOU NINE FIVE

04:06:07.052 --> 04:06:08.386
TO GO TO SCHOOL WHEN WE KNOW SO

04:06:08.453 --> 04:06:09.621
MANY PEOPLE?

04:06:09.688 --> 04:06:11.623
ARE HAVING TO WORK AND THEN TRY

04:06:11.690 --> 04:06:13.191
TO FIT THEIR EDUCATION AND AND

04:06:13.258 --> 04:06:14.693
THAT'S EVEN STUDENTS TO WRITE

04:06:14.759 --> 04:06:16.228
OFF A HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEN WE

04:06:16.294 --> 04:06:18.096
ALSO HAVE STUDENTS.

04:06:18.163 --> 04:06:20.499
THAT NEED TO COME BACK AND WHO

04:06:20.565 --> 04:06:21.800
ARE WHO ARE IN MIDDLE OF A

04:06:21.867 --> 04:06:23.335
CAREER CHANGER NEED NEW SKILL

04:06:23.401 --> 04:06:26.605
SET OR WHATEVER SO I WANT.

04:06:26.671 --> 04:06:28.874
MORE ONLINE COURSES THE ISSUE

04:06:28.940 --> 04:06:30.642
AND THE CONTROVERSY LAST YEAR

04:06:30.709 --> 04:06:32.077
AND I THINK IT'S BEING WELL

04:06:32.144 --> 04:06:36.181
POINTED OUT AGAIN TODAY IS THAT.

04:06:36.248 --> 04:06:37.249
WE'RE NOW HAPPY TO SET SOMETHING

04:06:37.315 --> 04:06:38.950
UP THAT IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS

04:06:39.017 --> 04:06:40.485
TO REALLY BE OPERATIONAL WHEN

04:06:40.552 --> 04:06:42.587
THE NEED IS NOW AND WHEN WE HAD

04:06:42.654 --> 04:06:44.356
DISTRICTS IN COLLEGES UP AND

04:06:44.422 --> 04:06:45.590
DOWN THE STATE.

04:06:45.657 --> 04:06:47.325
WHO SHOWED A DESIRE AND A

04:06:47.392 --> 04:06:48.994
WILLINGNESS TO FULFILL THE NEED

04:06:49.060 --> 04:06:50.562
AND WHO ARE ALREADY ACCREDITED

04:06:50.629 --> 04:06:52.230
AND WHO ALREADY HAVE CURRICULUM

04:06:52.297 --> 04:06:53.598
SO THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO

04:06:53.665 --> 04:06:55.033
DEVELOP CURRICULA?

04:06:55.100 --> 04:06:56.601
AND THEY ALSO CAN PROVIDE THE

04:06:56.668 --> 04:06:58.637
SUPPORT FOR THOSE STUDENTS TO

04:06:58.703 --> 04:07:00.906
TAKE THE CLASS ONLINE BUT MADE

04:07:00.972 --> 04:07:02.440
THEN NEED THE IN PERSON.

04:07:02.507 --> 04:07:05.110
SO I ROMANTICALLY THIS COLLEGE

04:07:05.177 --> 04:07:08.413
NEW DISTRICT IS LOCATED RIGHT BY

04:07:08.480 --> 04:07:10.782
OWN DISTRICT RIGHT IN OAKLAND --

04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:12.751
NOW I DOUBT -- FOR EXAMPLE

04:07:12.817 --> 04:07:14.452
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES THAT IF

04:07:14.519 --> 04:07:16.488
THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS IN YOUR

04:07:16.555 --> 04:07:18.523
AREA WHO DECIDE TO TAKE THE

04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:20.158
ONLINE COURSES FROM THIS.

04:07:20.225 --> 04:07:21.459
THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO

04:07:21.526 --> 04:07:25.230
OAKLAND TO GET THE SUPPORT SO IF.

04:07:25.297 --> 04:07:26.765
THE IF THE OAKLAND BASED

04:07:26.831 --> 04:07:28.433
DISTRICT HAS IN MIND THAT

04:07:28.500 --> 04:07:29.267
THEY'RE GOING TO SET UP

04:07:29.334 --> 04:07:30.902
SATELLITE SPOCK'S AROUND THE

04:07:30.969 --> 04:07:32.304
STATE TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT

04:07:32.370 --> 04:07:33.371
AND I DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE

04:07:33.438 --> 04:07:34.873
THAT'S WHY THE NEED TO SPEND

04:07:34.940 --> 04:07:36.374
FORTY EIGHT MILLION I DON'T KNOW

04:07:36.441 --> 04:07:38.376
BUT THAT SEEMS TO ME.

04:07:38.443 --> 04:07:40.111
A REAL DUPLICATE TO EFFORT GIVEN

04:07:40.178 --> 04:07:42.380
THAT WE HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

04:07:42.447 --> 04:07:43.815
UP AND DOWN THE STATE.

04:07:43.882 --> 04:07:47.252
SO MY ISSUE IS MUCH MORE.

04:07:47.319 --> 04:07:50.956
HOW DO WE BEST TO LIVE FOR ON?

04:07:51.022 --> 04:07:53.592
COURSES AND ONLINE TEACHING MOST

04:07:53.658 --> 04:07:56.561
COST EFFECTIVELY AND MOST

04:07:56.628 --> 04:07:58.730
EDUCATIONALLY EFFECTIVELY.

04:07:58.797 --> 04:08:02.634
AND I THE LAKE BEEN THE LAST

04:08:02.701 --> 04:08:04.736
YEAR'S DISCUSSION WAS EVEN LA --

04:08:04.803 --> 04:08:06.871
THAT RAISED THAT THE USE OF

04:08:06.938 --> 04:08:08.974
EXISTING ACCREDITED.

04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:10.475
LOCATIONS WHO ALREADY HAVE

04:08:10.542 --> 04:08:12.777
CURRICULA MAY BE A WISER COURSE.

04:08:12.844 --> 04:08:14.012
BUT IT WAS OUR THE

04:08:14.079 --> 04:08:15.313
ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR IN THE

04:08:15.380 --> 04:08:17.382
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT WAS BE

04:08:17.449 --> 04:08:20.085
RESET ON THIS -- PROPOSAL BUT

04:08:20.151 --> 04:08:22.320
LASTLY -- JUST POINT OUT AND I

04:08:22.387 --> 04:08:22.821
WOULD ASK.

04:08:22.887 --> 04:08:29.060
I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER.

04:08:29.127 --> 04:08:30.295
THING THAT WE IN PROP NINETY

04:08:30.362 --> 04:08:30.929
EIGHT THAT WE'VE GUARANTEED FOR

04:08:30.996 --> 04:08:31.263
SEVEN YEARS.

04:08:31.329 --> 04:08:32.197
THIS IS THE ONLY PROP NINETY

04:08:32.264 --> 04:08:33.431
EIGHT EXPENDITURES THAT I CAN

04:08:33.498 --> 04:08:35.567
THINK OF THAT WE SAID OKAY YES

04:08:35.634 --> 04:08:36.935
WE'RE GOING TO SET THIS ASIDE

04:08:37.002 --> 04:08:40.472
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

04:08:40.538 --> 04:08:42.274
FINANCIAL LIKE TO SPAWN BEFORE

04:08:42.340 --> 04:08:43.842
GOING TO THE DIGITAL MEMBERS OR

04:08:43.908 --> 04:08:45.477
I THINK AT THE SET ASIDE IS TIED

04:08:45.543 --> 04:08:46.711
UP WITH THE FACT THIS IS A BRAND

04:08:46.778 --> 04:08:47.712
NEW.

04:08:47.779 --> 04:08:49.214
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SAID THAT IS

04:08:49.281 --> 04:08:50.715
IT IS DIFFERENT BUT IT'S

04:08:50.782 --> 04:08:52.250
DIFFERENT FOR THAT REASON.

04:08:52.317 --> 04:08:54.119
MR MCCARTY NOT LINKED IS NOT

04:08:54.185 --> 04:08:55.487
CALLED THE CAPITAL BUT THAT'S

04:08:55.553 --> 04:08:55.920
OKAY.

04:08:55.987 --> 04:08:58.323
HELLO BUT IT'S FOR START UP

04:08:58.390 --> 04:09:00.025
COSTS YES.

04:09:00.091 --> 04:09:02.460
YEAH A FEW -- THOUGHTS ON THIS

04:09:02.527 --> 04:09:04.696
SO WE WE DID SPEND QUITE A BIT

04:09:04.763 --> 04:09:06.064
TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS.

04:09:06.131 --> 04:09:07.699
IN JUST TO GET THE CONCLUSION

04:09:07.766 --> 04:09:09.834
AFTER THIS DISCUSSION WE HAD

04:09:09.901 --> 04:09:11.069
STUDENTS IN THE AUDIENCE WERE

04:09:11.136 --> 04:09:12.637
TALKING ABOUT.

04:09:12.704 --> 04:09:14.272
BEING HUNGRY.

04:09:14.339 --> 04:09:15.607
AND VETERANS ONE OF THE GOOD

04:09:15.674 --> 04:09:17.242
GUYS RESOURCE CENTERS APPS BOOKS

04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:18.576
ADVOCATING.

04:09:18.643 --> 04:09:35.694
FOR THE THE POINT A PROGRAM IN

04:09:42.033 --> 04:09:43.201
THE EMOJI PROGRAM AND SO WE JUST

04:09:43.268 --> 04:09:44.069
THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE

04:09:44.135 --> 04:09:45.503
OTHER NEEDS TODAY.

04:09:45.570 --> 04:09:46.805
IT DOESN'T MEAN THIS PROGRAM

04:09:46.871 --> 04:09:47.672
SHOULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY SO

04:09:47.739 --> 04:09:48.840
LET'S LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK THE

04:09:48.907 --> 04:09:49.474
WHOLE PROGRAM SO.

04:09:49.541 --> 04:09:51.943
YEAH THERE THERE IS A BIG NEED --

04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:53.878
TO EDUCATE -- CALLED ADULTS WHO

04:09:53.945 --> 04:09:55.046
DON'T HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION OR

04:09:55.113 --> 04:09:55.580
EVEN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA

04:09:55.647 --> 04:09:56.581
BECAUSE HE JOBS OF TODAY AND

04:09:56.648 --> 04:10:00.952
TOMORROW ACQUIRE DOING ONLINE

04:10:01.019 --> 04:10:02.921
PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW -- WE HOPE

04:10:02.987 --> 04:10:04.289
NOT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK

04:10:04.356 --> 04:10:04.889
THERE'S AN ARRANGEMENT THIS

04:10:04.956 --> 04:10:06.257
SHOULD BE STUFF IT'S DIFFERENT

04:10:06.324 --> 04:10:07.592
WE'RE NOT GOING.

04:10:07.659 --> 04:10:09.327
TO COMPETE BUT THE BIG PICTURE

04:10:09.394 --> 04:10:11.730
IS -- THESE PROGRAMS ARE GONNA

04:10:11.796 --> 04:10:12.831
GET APPORTIONMENT WHICH YOU KNOW

04:10:12.897 --> 04:10:14.199
EQUIVALENT OF EIGHTY EIGHT SO

04:10:14.265 --> 04:10:15.700
THEY'RE GONNA GET MONEY PER

04:10:15.767 --> 04:10:18.269
STUDENT PER SLOT AS YOU

04:10:18.336 --> 04:10:19.304
MENTIONED EARLIER PER SEAT.

04:10:19.371 --> 04:10:21.539
SO DO THEY NEED A HUNDRED AND

04:10:21.606 --> 04:10:22.073
TWENTY THREE HUNDRED FORTY

04:10:22.140 --> 04:10:23.742
MILLION.

04:10:23.808 --> 04:10:25.110
BECAUSE IS A HUNDRED ONE TIME.

04:10:25.176 --> 04:10:26.544
THERE'S TWENTY ON GOING AND

04:10:26.611 --> 04:10:27.479
TWENTY ON GOING AGAIN WE'RE

04:10:27.545 --> 04:10:29.114

04:10:29.180 --> 04:10:30.682
MILLION AND THEY'VE SPENT NOT

04:10:30.749 --> 04:10:32.517
ONE MILLION. SEVEN HUNDRED

04:10:32.584 --> 04:10:33.785
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

04:10:33.852 --> 04:10:36.154
SO I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT

04:10:36.221 --> 04:10:38.957
YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM CAN EXIST.

04:10:39.023 --> 04:10:41.092
BUT DO THEY NEED THIS SLUSH FUND

RIGHT NOW WHEN WE CAN REEVALUATE

04:10:43.261 --> 04:10:45.830
IT EVERY YEAR.

04:10:45.897 --> 04:10:47.399
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE ARE --

04:10:47.465 --> 04:10:49.801

04:10:49.868 --> 04:10:51.436

04:10:51.503 --> 04:10:53.538
FUTURE AND OUR PRIORITIES FOR

OUR STUDENTS TODAY I KNOW --

04:10:56.374 --> 04:10:57.876

04:10:59.711 --> 04:11:01.279
PURSE BUT OUR PLAN TALKED ABOUT --

04:11:01.346 --> 04:11:03.415
INC IN INCREASING FUNDING FOR

04:11:03.481 --> 04:11:05.717
VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS ON

04:11:05.784 --> 04:11:08.920

04:11:14.125 --> 04:11:16.861
HUNGER FREE CAMPUSES TO MAKE

04:11:16.928 --> 04:11:17.362
SURE WE DEALING WITH OUR

04:11:17.429 --> 04:11:18.029
STUDENTS.

04:11:18.096 --> 04:11:20.665
BASIC NEEDS ISSUES -- AND I

04:11:20.732 --> 04:11:21.966
THINK YOU KNOW THOSE ARE REAL

04:11:22.033 --> 04:11:23.768
PRIORITIES FOR FOR OUR TWO

04:11:23.835 --> 04:11:25.503
MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGES TODAY.

04:11:25.570 --> 04:11:26.671
AND SO THIS IS JUST ABOUT

04:11:26.738 --> 04:11:28.173
PRIORITIES AND SELL I DON'T

04:11:28.239 --> 04:11:29.507

ROLLED OUT THIS IS A BUSINESS

04:11:38.883 --> 04:11:39.617
MAYBE THEY NEED A LITTLE START

04:11:39.684 --> 04:11:40.385
UP MONEY.

04:11:40.452 --> 04:11:44.122
BUT I THINK WE TOOK A GAS LAST

04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:45.757
YEAR ON THE START UP AND WE OVER

04:11:45.824 --> 04:11:47.692

04:11:47.759 --> 04:11:48.560
THIS IS.

04:11:48.626 --> 04:11:49.961

04:11:58.470 --> 04:11:59.871

COMMUNICABLE CHOSE.

04:12:08.480 --> 04:12:09.914
SO WHAT HAPPENED A NUMBER OF

04:12:09.981 --> 04:12:11.816
YEARS AGO -- WE WORK WITH

04:12:11.883 --> 04:12:12.750

04:12:57.161 --> 04:12:58.363
CAMPUS.

04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:59.264
OUR FEA WAS THAT IT WOULD

COMPLETELY DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

04:13:05.003 --> 04:13:06.538

04:13:06.604 --> 04:13:08.673

NEW.

04:13:52.584 --> 04:13:54.519
PROGRAM -- AS I THINK ALL THE

04:13:54.586 --> 04:13:55.587
COLLEAGUES HAVE SORT OF TALKED

04:13:55.653 --> 04:13:57.088
ABOUT THAT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS

04:13:57.155 --> 04:13:57.989
WITH LAST YEAR.

04:13:58.056 --> 04:14:00.925
AND WE CONTINUE CONCERNED HOW TO

04:14:00.992 --> 04:14:02.126
CASF CONCERNS WITH THIS YEAR AND

04:14:02.193 --> 04:14:05.430
I THINK WE WE WANT TO GIVE THE

NEW CHANCE A CHANCE -- FOR CLEAN

04:14:09.267 --> 04:14:10.034
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL.

04:14:10.101 --> 04:14:11.002
HAVING SAID THAT WE DO BELIEVE

04:14:11.069 --> 04:14:13.304
THAT HE HAS EVEN UNDER OUR

04:14:13.371 --> 04:14:14.472
ASSEMBLY PREPARATION WHICH AGAIN

04:14:14.539 --> 04:14:16.841
IS FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

04:14:16.908 --> 04:14:18.343
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME

04:14:18.409 --> 04:14:19.911
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING

04:14:19.978 --> 04:14:20.778
MORE.

04:14:20.845 --> 04:14:22.347
THAN ENOUGH MONEY OVER EVEN THE

04:14:22.413 --> 04:14:24.349
NEXT TWO YEARS TO REALLY DO

04:14:24.415 --> 04:14:26.084
SOMETHING.

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:28.252
VERY INTERESTING AND AGAIN GIVES

04:14:28.319 --> 04:14:30.588
US THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO BE

04:14:30.655 --> 04:14:31.089

04:14:31.155 --> 04:14:31.656

ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY

04:14:35.994 --> 04:14:38.596
COLLEGES. TO KEEP MOVING ONLINE

04:14:38.663 --> 04:14:42.500
SO THAT THAT REALLY WAS THE IDEA

04:14:42.567 --> 04:14:45.803
BEHIND THE THICK [inaudible]

04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:49.073
DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible]

04:14:49.140 --> 04:14:51.309
YES CLUB.

04:14:51.376 --> 04:14:53.044
AS I LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATION

04:14:53.111 --> 04:14:55.279
AT YOU KNOW I I'VE FIRST BEING

04:14:55.346 --> 04:14:56.881
VERY HONEST I'VE NEVER BEEN

04:14:56.948 --> 04:14:58.249
FAVOR THIS PROPOSAL.

04:14:58.316 --> 04:14:59.851
ONLINE COLLEGE I I THINK IT'S A

04:14:59.917 --> 04:15:00.785
WASTE OF RESOURCES AND I DON'T

04:15:00.852 --> 04:15:01.552
AND BEING AN EDUCATOR I DON'T

04:15:01.619 --> 04:15:03.021
THINK IS THE BEST WAY FOR US TO

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:04.055
REALLY BE ENGAGED IN.

04:15:04.122 --> 04:15:05.490
ONLINE EDUCATION -- BECAUSE WE

04:15:05.556 --> 04:15:06.691
HAVE ALREADY THE INFRASTRUCTURE

04:15:06.758 --> 04:15:08.559
IN PLACE IT REQUIRES A LOT OF

04:15:08.626 --> 04:15:10.662
TECHNOLOGY TO DO ONLINE

04:15:10.728 --> 04:15:12.964
INSTRUCTION AND TO DO IT WELL

04:15:13.031 --> 04:15:13.631
OKAY.

04:15:13.698 --> 04:15:17.335
SO -- AND GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY

04:15:17.402 --> 04:15:18.369
AS WELL AS THE THE BROAD.

04:15:18.436 --> 04:15:19.137
SWEEP OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE

04:15:19.203 --> 04:15:21.673
HAVE IN CALIFORNIA ALL OVER THE

04:15:21.739 --> 04:15:24.342
STATE AND AND AND AND I'VE I'VE

04:15:24.409 --> 04:15:26.344
BEEN A PART OF AND SEEN A LOT OF

04:15:26.411 --> 04:15:27.812
THE ONLINE INSTRUCTION.

04:15:27.879 --> 04:15:29.447
I MEAN IT'S AN AMAZING THING AND

04:15:29.514 --> 04:15:30.481
AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN WE

04:15:30.548 --> 04:15:32.216
CAN DO WHAT WE CAN DELIVER

04:15:32.283 --> 04:15:33.251
ALMOST ANY CURRICULUM THAT WE

04:15:33.317 --> 04:15:33.885
WANT.

04:15:33.951 --> 04:15:35.253
ACROSS THE STATE TO SET UP A

04:15:35.319 --> 04:15:36.654
WHOLE COLLEGE IT DOES NOTHING

04:15:36.721 --> 04:15:38.089
BUT ONLINE INSTRUCTION.

04:15:38.156 --> 04:15:39.924
I THINK LIMITS WHAT WHAT'S GOING

04:15:39.991 --> 04:15:41.426
TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF ONLINE

04:15:41.492 --> 04:15:43.361
INSTRUCTION BECAUSE YOU ALREADY

04:15:43.428 --> 04:15:45.730
HAVE AN AMAZING INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:15:45.797 --> 04:15:47.131
THAT HAVING BEEN SAID -- YOU

04:15:47.198 --> 04:15:48.733
KNOW AYE AYES I STILL GET THE

04:15:48.800 --> 04:15:51.069
SENSE THAT THAT THE THE SENATE

04:15:51.135 --> 04:15:52.170
AND ASSEMBLY ARE.

04:15:52.236 --> 04:15:54.205
ARE ARE BASICALLY HIT HESITANT

04:15:54.272 --> 04:15:55.973
ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL OF OF ONLINE

04:15:56.040 --> 04:15:57.608
INSTRUCTION WHICH I THINK IS IS

04:15:57.675 --> 04:15:59.343
THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN

04:15:59.410 --> 04:16:01.179
WHEN YOU TRYING TO DEVELOP A NEW

04:16:01.245 --> 04:16:02.013
ENTITY.

04:16:02.080 --> 04:16:02.747
YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO

04:16:02.814 --> 04:16:03.981
DEVELOP A COLLEGE WHEN WE DECIDE

04:16:04.048 --> 04:16:05.616
WE'RE GONNA DO YOU SEE YOU SEE

04:16:05.683 --> 04:16:06.951
MERCED A WHERE WE'RE GOING TO DO

04:16:07.018 --> 04:16:08.820
IT WE SET ASIDE WHICH IS TRUE.

04:16:08.886 --> 04:16:11.022
A CHUNK OF MONEY TO HANDLE IT SO

04:16:11.089 --> 04:16:11.589
WE'RE GOING TO REALLY DO A

04:16:11.656 --> 04:16:13.157
COLLEGE YOU HAVE TO SET ASIDE A

04:16:13.224 --> 04:16:14.859
CHUNK OF MONEY BECAUSE THOSE WHO

04:16:14.926 --> 04:16:16.561
ARE PLANNING CAN'T WAIT EVERY

04:16:16.627 --> 04:16:18.162
YEAR FOR AN ALLOCATION BECAUSE

04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:19.630
THAT HINDERS.

04:16:19.697 --> 04:16:21.632
THE THE NEW PROJECTS ARE YOU IF

04:16:21.699 --> 04:16:23.134
YOU GO TO A NEW COLLEGE OR NEW

04:16:23.201 --> 04:16:24.035
WHAT WE'VE DONE NEW COLLEGES IN

04:16:24.102 --> 04:16:26.304
AT THE UNIVERSITY -- WE HAVE TO

04:16:26.370 --> 04:16:27.805
SET ASIDE MONEY IT'S SOMETIMES

04:16:27.872 --> 04:16:29.674
PAINFUL TO DO BUT YOU HAVE TO DO

04:16:29.741 --> 04:16:31.008
IT BECAUSE INVESTMENT HAS TO BE

04:16:31.075 --> 04:16:32.376
TO IT TO TRY TO RECRUIT.

04:16:32.443 --> 04:16:35.413
FACULTY AND AND AND BY HARDWARE

04:16:35.480 --> 04:16:36.013
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU

04:16:36.080 --> 04:16:37.782
HAVE TO DO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:39.684
TO HAVE MONEY THIS SET ASIDE SO.

04:16:39.751 --> 04:16:41.352
IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE

04:16:41.419 --> 04:16:42.453
TO DO THAT.

04:16:42.520 --> 04:16:44.288
IT'S ALSO AS I LISTEN TO US TALK

04:16:44.355 --> 04:16:45.757
SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS BECAUSE AT

04:16:45.823 --> 04:16:47.425
SOME POINT IT SAYS TO PEOPLE WE

04:16:47.492 --> 04:16:48.392
GIVE YOU MONEY BETTER SPENT

04:16:48.459 --> 04:16:49.627
RIGHT AWAY EVEN IF YOU HAVE A

04:16:49.694 --> 04:16:50.828
GOOD REASON SPENT.

04:16:50.895 --> 04:16:52.096
BECAUSE IF NOT WE WILL COME BACK

04:16:52.163 --> 04:16:53.798
AND GET T AND THAT'S WHAT

04:16:53.865 --> 04:16:55.166
HAPPENS A PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN

04:16:55.233 --> 04:16:56.467
THEY DON'T ALLOW YOU ROLL MONEY

04:16:56.534 --> 04:16:58.469
OVER THEY JUMP UP IN THE LAST

04:16:58.536 --> 04:17:00.304
THREE WEEKS IT START BY AND ALL

04:17:00.371 --> 04:17:01.572
KIND OF SUFF THE TITLE ONE AND

04:17:01.639 --> 04:17:02.840
STUFF THEY MAY NEVER USED IS.

04:17:02.907 --> 04:17:05.042
STORED SOMEWHERE AND MAYBE IT'S

04:17:05.109 --> 04:17:06.711
YOU KNOW GET EATEN BY RATS OR

04:17:06.778 --> 04:17:08.346
WHATEVER BUT THE BUT THEY USE

04:17:08.412 --> 04:17:09.080
THE MONEY BECAUSE THAT THEY

04:17:09.147 --> 04:17:10.782
DON'T THERE'S A DISTRICT WE COME

04:17:10.848 --> 04:17:12.784
BACK AND SAY ALL WE CAN TAKE

04:17:12.850 --> 04:17:13.484
THAT BACK FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU

04:17:13.551 --> 04:17:14.018
DIDN'T USE IT.

04:17:14.085 --> 04:17:23.561
SO EVERYBODY GOT SMART STAR USES

04:17:23.628 --> 04:17:25.596
STEPH SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

04:17:25.663 --> 04:17:26.397
WE START TELLING PEOPLE YOU ONLY

04:17:26.464 --> 04:17:27.465
SPEND A LITTLE BIT SO WE DON'T

04:17:27.532 --> 04:17:28.332
TAKE IT FROM YOU.

04:17:28.399 --> 04:17:29.333
SO THEREFORE THE NEXT GROUP THAT

04:17:29.400 --> 04:17:30.568
COMES ALONG THE WORD IS CLEAR

04:17:30.635 --> 04:17:32.970
SPEND YOUR STUFF EVEN IF YOU

04:17:33.037 --> 04:17:33.271
DON'T NEED.

04:17:33.337 --> 04:17:34.872
TO SO.

04:17:34.939 --> 04:17:36.107
I'M IN A WEIRD POSITION WITH

04:17:36.174 --> 04:17:37.241
REGARD TO THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT

04:17:37.308 --> 04:17:38.242
AN ADVOCATE OF THIS AT ALL --

04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:39.944
AND I WOULD PROBABLY TAKE ALL

04:17:40.011 --> 04:17:41.145
THE MONEY AND SAY WELL THIS KIND

04:17:41.212 --> 04:17:42.480
OF AS A SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR

04:17:42.547 --> 04:17:43.748
LOSS AND MOVE ON AW AND IF

04:17:43.815 --> 04:17:44.382
THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO WE NEED

04:17:44.448 --> 04:17:44.649
TO DO IT.

04:17:44.715 --> 04:17:45.483
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT

04:17:45.550 --> 04:17:47.318
BEFORE THEY GET TO THE FORTY

04:17:47.385 --> 04:17:47.919
THREE MILLION THAT YOU TALKING

04:17:47.985 --> 04:17:48.553
ABOUT -- THEN WE NEED TO MAKE A

04:17:48.619 --> 04:17:50.521
COMMITMENT TO IT BUT I'M NOT

04:17:50.588 --> 04:17:51.956

INTO THIS BECAUSE I THINK.

04:17:54.792 --> 04:17:56.527
THE AND I TOLD I TOLD THE LAST

04:17:56.594 --> 04:17:57.695
GOVERNOR THAT THAT WHAT HE

04:17:57.762 --> 04:17:58.896
WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH COULD

04:17:58.963 --> 04:18:00.498
EASILY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE

04:18:00.565 --> 04:18:02.133
CURRENT STRUCTURE OF

04:18:02.200 --> 04:18:03.901
CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER IT'S SYSTEM.

04:18:03.968 --> 04:18:05.369
WOULD MORE RESOURCE IS GOING TO

04:18:05.436 --> 04:18:06.771

EXPERIENCE AND TARGETING THOSE

04:18:10.875 --> 04:18:12.677
THINGS AND THEN WITH THOSE YOU

04:18:12.743 --> 04:18:13.711
CAN YOU KNOW THEY CAN HOOK UP

04:18:13.778 --> 04:18:15.213
ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

04:18:15.279 --> 04:18:16.447
AS WELL AS MANY BY SEE ISSUES

04:18:16.514 --> 04:18:18.616
DOMINGUEZ HILLS AS THE GREATEST

04:18:18.683 --> 04:18:20.852
KIND OF THING WE ARE DO A WHOLE

04:18:20.918 --> 04:18:22.753
A WHOLE LIBRARY DEGREE IN A IS

04:18:22.820 --> 04:18:24.789
ONLINE RIGHT NOW FOR THE WHOLE

04:18:24.856 --> 04:18:26.591
STATE -- A GUN TO EPPING SAN

04:18:26.657 --> 04:18:28.159
JOSE AND UP AND THEY GET

04:18:28.226 --> 04:18:29.193
TOGETHER MAYBE EVERY THREE OR

04:18:29.260 --> 04:18:30.928
FOUR MONTHS OR WHATEVER FOR ONE

04:18:30.995 --> 04:18:32.730

ONLINE BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED.

04:18:37.401 --> 04:18:38.202
FOR ONE PROGRAM IN ONE SECTION

04:18:38.269 --> 04:18:40.638
SO ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT IF WE

04:18:40.705 --> 04:18:42.874
DON'T DO IT WE NEED TO DO IT

04:18:42.940 --> 04:18:44.275
GIVEN THE HUNDRED TWENTY BECAUSE

04:18:44.342 --> 04:18:45.443
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME IF THEY

04:18:45.509 --> 04:18:46.911
REALLY WANT TO PLAN ABOUT.

04:18:46.978 --> 04:18:48.412
OUR CHANCES SHOULD COME HERE AND

04:18:48.479 --> 04:18:49.013
TELL US WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH

04:18:49.080 --> 04:18:49.680
THE MONEY THOUGH COULD YOU JUST

04:18:49.747 --> 04:18:51.816
DON'T GIVE A PERSON  HUNDRED

04:18:51.883 --> 04:18:52.450
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MILLION

04:18:52.516 --> 04:18:53.651
DOLLARS AND SAY GOAL GO FORTH

04:18:53.718 --> 04:18:55.820
AND BE GOOD -- THEY NEED TO TELL

04:18:55.887 --> 04:18:57.054
WHAT THEY WILL DO BUT OTHERWISE

04:18:57.121 --> 04:18:58.155
IF WE WE START TAKING A PROBLEM

04:18:58.222 --> 04:18:59.991
TELL YOU THE WORD TO GET AROUND

04:19:00.057 --> 04:19:00.925
REAL QUICK IN THE STATE.

04:19:00.992 --> 04:19:02.393
THAT IF THE IF THEY GIVE YOU

04:19:02.460 --> 04:19:03.427
SOME MONEY.

04:19:03.494 --> 04:19:04.862
YOU BETTER USE IT BECAUSE

04:19:04.929 --> 04:19:06.130
OTHERWISE I'LL COME BACK AND

04:19:06.197 --> 04:19:07.899
TAKE IT FROM ME.

04:19:07.965 --> 04:19:17.174
EXACTLY.

04:19:17.241 --> 04:19:19.210
SO.

04:19:19.277 --> 04:19:20.278
IF I JUST MIGHT ADD I DON'T WANT

04:19:20.344 --> 04:19:20.778
TO REPEAT WHAT'S BEEN

04:19:20.845 --> 04:19:22.313
ARTICULATED BY ALL OF MY

04:19:22.380 --> 04:19:23.848
COLLEAGUES -- BUT BUT BUT I

04:19:23.915 --> 04:19:24.815
CLEARLY RECALL OUR EXPERIENCE

04:19:24.882 --> 04:19:26.384
LAST YEAR AND ONE CHALLENGE WAS --

04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:30.621
THE CONCEPT WAS IT -- COMPLETELY

04:19:30.688 --> 04:19:31.589
THAT IT IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL --

04:19:31.656 --> 04:19:32.890
WE WERE TOLD ONE THING WE WERE

04:19:32.957 --> 04:19:33.457
TOLD THAT THE WITH GOING TO

04:19:33.524 --> 04:19:35.326
OFFER CERTIFICATES AND A. A.'S

04:19:35.393 --> 04:19:36.427
THAT DIDN'T CHANGE WIN THE

04:19:36.494 --> 04:19:37.762
CHANCE OF THEN CAME BACK BEFORE

04:19:37.828 --> 04:19:38.329
US.%

04:19:38.396 --> 04:19:39.664
AND SO IT WAS CLEAR TO US THAT

04:19:39.730 --> 04:19:43.401
IT WAS A MOVING TARGET.

04:19:43.467 --> 04:19:44.268
I CONTRADICT THAT TO THE

04:19:44.335 --> 04:19:44.902
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THIS YEAR

04:19:44.969 --> 04:19:47.071
WERE HE'S GOT PLANNING DOLLARS

04:19:47.138 --> 04:19:49.540
TO LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF A

04:19:49.607 --> 04:19:50.574
NEW C. ISSUE.

04:19:50.641 --> 04:19:52.243
IN STOCKTON.

04:19:52.310 --> 04:19:53.945
SO WHAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SET

04:19:54.011 --> 04:19:55.880
MUCH BETTER WITH ALL OF US LAST

04:19:55.947 --> 04:19:56.580
YEAR.

04:19:56.647 --> 04:19:58.082
IS IF YOU'D COME FOR IT WITH THE

04:19:58.149 --> 04:20:00.217
CONCEPT AND ASK FOR PLANNING

04:20:00.284 --> 04:20:02.954
DOLLARS RESOURCES -- THEN WE

04:20:03.020 --> 04:20:03.654
COULD.

04:20:03.721 --> 04:20:05.256
COME BACK THIS YEAR LOOK AT A

04:20:05.323 --> 04:20:08.292
PLAN AND BE BETTER POLLS -- TO

04:20:08.359 --> 04:20:10.661
SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR QUEST TO

04:20:10.728 --> 04:20:12.196
FULLY FUND WHATEVER THE TIME IT

04:20:12.263 --> 04:20:13.164
WAS.

04:20:13.230 --> 04:20:16.200
JUST SEEMS -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO

04:20:16.267 --> 04:20:17.435
FOLLOW EIGHT EIGHT CONSISTENT

04:20:17.501 --> 04:20:19.370
OUT LINE OF THOUGHT THAT FOR ONE

04:20:19.437 --> 04:20:21.772
INSTITUTION REQUIRES PLANNING

04:20:21.839 --> 04:20:22.573
AND INVESTMENT.

04:20:22.640 --> 04:20:23.541
AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

04:20:23.607 --> 04:20:24.775
INVESTMENT FOR PLANNING TO

04:20:24.842 --> 04:20:26.010
DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ITS

04:20:26.077 --> 04:20:27.678
VALUE.

04:20:27.745 --> 04:20:30.648
VERSUS AN IDEA THAT THAT THAT

04:20:30.715 --> 04:20:32.450
CHANGED MIDSTREAM IN TERMS OF

04:20:32.516 --> 04:20:35.353
WHAT.

04:20:35.419 --> 04:20:36.854
THE ULTIMATE.

04:20:36.921 --> 04:20:38.723
GOAL WOULD BE FIRST WE WERE TOLD.

04:20:38.789 --> 04:20:39.991
A A THE CERTIFICATE THAT WE WERE

04:20:40.057 --> 04:20:41.659
TOLD NO -- AS I RECALL S. CI YOU

04:20:41.726 --> 04:20:43.527
CAME IN SUPPORT ME AND WE WERE

04:20:43.594 --> 04:20:45.129
CLEAR THAT WAS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

04:20:45.196 --> 04:20:46.564
KIND OF ELEVATED THEIR CURRENT

04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:49.367
POSITION SO SEAD YOU TALKED

04:20:49.433 --> 04:20:53.337
ABOUT OF WE HAVE YOU KNOW --

04:20:53.404 --> 04:20:54.605
CLERK TYPIST.

04:20:54.672 --> 04:20:55.539
TO AND THEN YOU WANT TO BE A

04:20:55.606 --> 04:20:56.407
CLERK TYPIST WNDER IF YOU COULD

04:20:56.474 --> 04:20:58.142
TAKE THIS TRAINING ONLINE AND

04:20:58.209 --> 04:20:59.043
MOVE UP.

04:20:59.110 --> 04:21:00.578
AND SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO WHAT

04:21:00.644 --> 04:21:01.879
WE ARE EXPERIENCING REMEMBER

04:21:01.946 --> 04:21:03.247
LAST YEAR IT APPEARED TO BE A

04:21:03.314 --> 04:21:04.749
MOVING TARGET AND NOW WE'RE

04:21:04.815 --> 04:21:05.750
HEARING.

04:21:05.816 --> 04:21:08.252
THAT YOU SPENT ONE TENTH OF THE

04:21:08.319 --> 04:21:09.587
DOLLARS ALLOCATED.

04:21:09.653 --> 04:21:12.456
IN A CLIMATE IN WHICH WE HAVE

04:21:12.523 --> 04:21:13.858
MORE IN THE THE WE HAVE

04:21:13.924 --> 04:21:17.261
RESOURCES I THINK THAT.

04:21:17.328 --> 04:21:18.362
THE ONE PIECE THAT WOULD ADD TO

04:21:18.429 --> 04:21:20.231
WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SHARED ON

04:21:20.297 --> 04:21:22.299
AND I THINK IT'S REFLECTED -- IN

04:21:22.366 --> 04:21:23.768
BOTH THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE

04:21:23.834 --> 04:21:26.604
ASSEMBLY AND THE QUESTIONS MY

04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:28.305
SENATE SUB ONE SURE ASK IN TERMS

04:21:28.372 --> 04:21:31.842
OF WILL YOU INDEED BE CRIPPLED

04:21:31.909 --> 04:21:33.411
BY HAVING THE BUDGET CUT AT

04:21:33.477 --> 04:21:35.246
LEAST FOR THE NEXT YEAR.

04:21:35.312 --> 04:21:35.746
IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER

04:21:35.813 --> 04:21:37.648
QUESTIONS.

04:21:37.715 --> 04:21:38.849
MR OBERNOLTE.

04:21:38.916 --> 04:21:41.018
ALL WAY AND QUICKLY MADAM

04:21:41.085 --> 04:21:42.586
CHAIRMAN.

04:21:42.653 --> 04:21:43.754
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO

04:21:43.821 --> 04:21:44.822
THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH

04:21:44.889 --> 04:21:46.357
WATER HERE.

04:21:46.424 --> 04:21:48.025
IF YOU FAST FORWARD A HUNDRED

04:21:48.092 --> 04:21:49.193
YEARS FROM NOW.

04:21:49.260 --> 04:21:50.528
I THINK NO ONE WOULD DISPUTE THE

04:21:50.594 --> 04:21:52.696
FACT THAT MOST EDUCATION WILL BE

04:21:52.763 --> 04:21:53.898
ONLINE.

04:21:53.964 --> 04:21:56.600
IN A WITH PERIODIC VISITS TO AN

04:21:56.667 --> 04:21:58.002
IN PERSON FACILITY.

04:21:58.069 --> 04:21:59.770
AND HOW WE GET FROM HERE TO

04:21:59.837 --> 04:22:01.072
THERE IS THE QUESTION NOW

04:22:01.138 --> 04:22:02.339
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEST

04:22:02.406 --> 04:22:02.840
ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE

04:22:02.907 --> 04:22:03.707
TRADITIONAL.

04:22:03.774 --> 04:22:05.042
COMMUNITY OLLEGE SYSTEM OR IF

04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:06.677
IF IT REQUIRES A NEW ONLINE

04:22:06.744 --> 04:22:08.512
INSTITUTION I'VE GOT TO RECENT

04:22:08.579 --> 04:22:10.047
EXPERIENCE ON THIS LAST YEAR I

04:22:10.114 --> 04:22:11.682
WENT BACK TO GRADUATE SCHOOL

04:22:11.749 --> 04:22:12.883
OBVIOUSLY I DID IT.

04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:13.818
THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING

04:22:13.884 --> 04:22:15.152
PROGRAM BECAUSE I GOT TO BE IN

04:22:15.219 --> 04:22:16.420
SACRAMENTO EVERY DAY.

04:22:16.487 --> 04:22:19.523
BUT I DO REALLY GAVE ME AN

04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:20.157
APPRECIATION.

04:22:20.224 --> 04:22:21.158
FOR HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO DO

04:22:21.225 --> 04:22:22.560
ONLINE EDUCATION WHILE IT'S NOT

04:22:22.626 --> 04:22:24.061
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN JUST

04:22:24.128 --> 04:22:25.463
THROW TOGETHER ON A WEBSITE AND

04:22:25.529 --> 04:22:27.231
EXPECT PEOPLE TO LEARN IN A WAY

04:22:27.298 --> 04:22:29.100
THAT SUPERIOR TO DOING IT IN

04:22:29.166 --> 04:22:30.968
PERSON SO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE

04:22:31.035 --> 04:22:31.869
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE

04:22:31.936 --> 04:22:33.904
FOCUSING ON THE LONG TERM HERE

04:22:33.971 --> 04:22:35.072
FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT IT'S

04:22:35.139 --> 04:22:37.108
NOT GOING TO BE A AN EASY LEFT.

04:22:37.174 --> 04:22:39.043
TO GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND

04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:40.444
RUNNING AND AND I'V I'M OF THE

04:22:40.511 --> 04:22:41.545
OPINION THAT WE OUGHT TO GIVE

04:22:41.612 --> 04:22:42.513
THEM THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

04:22:42.580 --> 04:22:44.048
NEED. TO TO DO THE JOB THAT

04:22:44.115 --> 04:22:45.649
WE'VE GIVEN THEM EVEN IF IT'S

04:22:45.716 --> 04:22:48.018
TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO ROLL

04:22:48.085 --> 04:22:51.055
OUT THAN WE EXPECTED.

04:22:51.122 --> 04:22:53.491
TO TO AND THE SENATOR OFF.

04:22:53.557 --> 04:22:55.359
YOU KNOW I GUESS I HELP START

04:22:55.426 --> 04:22:56.760
THIS DISCUSSION SO.

04:22:56.827 --> 04:22:58.395
I PROBABLY SHOULD TRY TO FINISH

04:22:58.462 --> 04:22:58.829
THE TERM.

04:22:58.896 --> 04:23:00.698
I HAD SOME RESERVATIONS -- MINE

04:23:00.764 --> 04:23:02.433
THIS PROPOSAL WAS FIRST BROUGHT

04:23:02.500 --> 04:23:05.569
TO WAS SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT --

04:23:05.636 --> 04:23:07.204
CREATING A NEW ENTITY HIRING A

04:23:07.271 --> 04:23:08.672
NEW PRESIDENT AND A WHOLE BUNCH

04:23:08.739 --> 04:23:10.374
OF IT EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENTS

04:23:10.441 --> 04:23:11.675
AND CREATING A BRIDGE

04:23:11.742 --> 04:23:14.845
BUREAUCRACY WITHOUT -- REALLY.

04:23:14.912 --> 04:23:16.614
HITTING THE MARK ON OF THE FIRST

04:23:16.680 --> 04:23:18.449
MARK ON THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

04:23:18.516 --> 04:23:20.351
THAT ARE SET OUT BUT I WAS

04:23:20.417 --> 04:23:21.919
CONVINCED THAT -- REALLY IN

04:23:21.986 --> 04:23:24.922
ORDER TO GET SOME DECENT METRICS.

04:23:24.989 --> 04:23:27.124
INSTEAD OF SPREADING A LITTLE

04:23:27.191 --> 04:23:28.759
BROTHER LIMITED.

04:23:28.826 --> 04:23:29.460
EARLY SPEAKING LIMITED AMOUNT OF

04:23:29.527 --> 04:23:30.494
MONEY OVER.

04:23:30.561 --> 04:23:32.163
BUT ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN OR

04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:34.398
SO COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WE WE

04:23:34.465 --> 04:23:35.866
REALLY OUT OF FOCUS THIS EFFORT

04:23:35.933 --> 04:23:38.435
AND ONE SO WE COULD SET SOME

04:23:38.502 --> 04:23:40.271
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND OBTAIN

04:23:40.337 --> 04:23:43.407
SOME MEASUREMENTS -- I THINK THE

04:23:43.474 --> 04:23:44.909
DIFFICULTY THAT I HAVE AND OF

04:23:44.975 --> 04:23:45.876
COURSE WE DIDN'T TAKE UP WE

04:23:45.943 --> 04:23:46.844
DIDN'T HAVE A PROPOSAL IN THIS

04:23:46.911 --> 04:23:48.012
SO WE DON'T HAVE A HEARING ON IT

04:23:48.078 --> 04:23:49.513
I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES

04:23:49.580 --> 04:23:50.614
THAT I HAVE.

04:23:50.681 --> 04:23:52.783
IS UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT

04:23:52.850 --> 04:23:55.786
OF TAKING FIFTY MILLION AWAY

04:23:55.853 --> 04:23:58.522
FROM ONE HUNDRED MILLION WE'VE

04:23:58.589 --> 04:23:59.723
HEARD THAT THE A OF THE BOARD

04:23:59.790 --> 04:24:01.058

WHICH I ASSUME IS FOR THIS NEXT

04:24:03.561 --> 04:24:05.629
BUDGET YEAR -- AND I I GUESS I

04:24:05.696 --> 04:24:06.997
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN I DON'T

04:24:07.064 --> 04:24:08.465
KNOW HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION.

04:24:08.532 --> 04:24:10.301
IN LEARNING WHAT THAT WHAT THE

04:24:10.367 --> 04:24:11.268
NEXT BUDGET YEAR.

04:24:11.335 --> 04:24:14.605
IS LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT DO THEY

04:24:14.672 --> 04:24:16.207
IN FACT NEED THAT IN ORDER TO

04:24:16.273 --> 04:24:18.275

APPROVED THIS THING.

04:24:22.546 --> 04:24:25.783
WHETHER WITHOUT RESERVATIONS WE

04:24:25.849 --> 04:24:27.885
OUGHT TO GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY --

04:24:27.952 --> 04:24:29.820

04:24:32.690 --> 04:24:33.824
ARE.

04:24:33.891 --> 04:24:34.858
AND SEE WHAT THE MEASUREMENTS

04:24:34.925 --> 04:24:36.660
ARE AND WHETHER IN FACT HITS THE

04:24:36.727 --> 04:24:38.762

THE GOVERNOR HAD NO SPECIFIC

04:30:47.230 --> 04:30:49.366

USED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE

04:31:06.216 --> 04:31:08.051

THE ASSEMBLY DID ALSO --

04:31:24.768 --> 04:31:25.636
HABITABLE LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES

04:31:25.702 --> 04:31:27.004
COLLEGES TO USE EQUAL

WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE.

04:34:56.313 --> 04:34:58.248
THIS IS A PROGRAM THE LEGAL

04:34:58.315 --> 04:34:59.249
SERVICES ON RECEIVE TEN MILLION

04:34:59.316 --> 04:35:00.383

04:35:00.450 --> 04:35:01.384
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

04:35:01.451 --> 04:35:02.252
THAT THE PROGRAM BEING

04:35:02.319 --> 04:35:03.687
ADMINISTERED BY DSS AS PART OF

04:35:03.753 --> 04:35:10.360
ITS LARGER IMMIGRATION SERVICES

04:35:10.427 --> 04:35:12.329
FUNDING PROGRAM.

04:35:12.395 --> 04:35:12.863
WHERE THEY CONTRACT WITH

04:35:12.929 --> 04:35:13.396
NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES

04:35:13.463 --> 04:35:14.664
PROVIDERS IN OUR CONVERSATIONS

04:35:14.731 --> 04:35:15.599
WITH THE SST INDICATED THAT NONE

04:35:15.665 --> 04:35:17.367
OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING HAVE

04:35:17.434 --> 04:35:18.969
BEEN PROVIDED PART SORRY?

04:35:19.035 --> 04:35:20.036
ANOTHER ONE COMPANY HAD BEEN

04:35:20.103 --> 04:35:22.472
SPENT IN IN -- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

04:35:22.539 --> 04:35:23.073
SO WE THINK THAT THAT FUNDING

04:35:23.139 --> 04:35:24.441
CAN BE REPURPOSED TO COVER THE

04:35:24.507 --> 04:35:25.375
NINETEEN TWENTY COSTS IF THERE

04:35:25.442 --> 04:35:26.409
IS AN INTERESTING FUNDING THE

04:35:26.476 --> 04:35:28.979
PROGRAM ONE TIME AND THAT COULD

04:35:29.045 --> 04:35:31.514
BE PROVIDED IN.

04:35:31.581 --> 04:35:32.082
TWENTY TWENTY ONE FINANCE.

04:35:32.148 --> 04:35:32.682
I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THAT

04:35:32.749 --> 04:35:33.250
LAST POINT REGARDING THE TEN

04:35:33.316 --> 04:35:35.819
MILLION FUNDING SO WE BELIEVE --

04:35:35.886 --> 04:35:37.120
BUT CONVERSATIONS WITH DSS THAT

04:35:37.187 --> 04:35:38.455
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT

04:35:38.521 --> 04:35:39.489
SPENDING.

04:35:39.556 --> 04:35:40.857
OF THAT MONEY WILL BE SPENT IN

04:35:40.924 --> 04:35:42.525
THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO WE

04:35:42.592 --> 04:35:43.693
BELIEVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

04:35:43.760 --> 04:35:45.262
COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET FOR

04:35:45.328 --> 04:35:46.796
IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES WE'VE

04:35:46.863 --> 04:35:47.898
ALREADY REACHED OUT TO US SENATE

04:35:47.964 --> 04:35:49.399
STAFF ON THIS AND HAPPY TO

04:35:49.466 --> 04:35:51.334
CONTINUE TO ADDRESS.

04:35:51.401 --> 04:35:51.902
ANY CONCERNS IN THE UPCOMING

04:35:51.968 --> 04:35:52.836

04:35:52.903 --> 04:35:55.138
THANK YOU.

04:35:55.205 --> 04:35:56.573
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

04:35:56.640 --> 04:35:58.575
CETERA WHAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT

04:35:58.642 --> 04:35:59.910
TEN MILLION HASN'T BEEN SPENT

04:35:59.976 --> 04:36:01.444
THAT WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR

04:36:01.511 --> 04:36:03.380
DO YOU BELIEVE THE NEED TO BE

04:36:03.446 --> 04:36:04.648
TWENTY MILLION ASSURES THAT WHAT

04:36:04.714 --> 04:36:05.649
I UNDERSTAND.

04:36:05.715 --> 04:36:07.284
SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS AT TEN

04:36:07.350 --> 04:36:08.718
MILLION ONE TIME APPROPRIATION

04:36:08.785 --> 04:36:10.554
AND THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING

04:36:10.620 --> 04:36:11.888
APPROPRIATIONS.

04:36:11.955 --> 04:36:13.356
THAT'S CORRECT SO IT WAS TEN

04:36:13.423 --> 04:36:15.091
MILLION ONE TIME THE TWENTY

04:36:15.158 --> 04:36:15.859
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND

04:36:15.926 --> 04:36:17.627
WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION

04:36:17.694 --> 04:36:18.962
ONGOING I THINK.

04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:20.196
FOR WHAT WE'RE SIGNALLING IS WE

04:36:20.263 --> 04:36:23.900
WILL HAVE A CONTINUE DISCUSSION

04:36:23.967 --> 04:36:25.568
WITH THE STAFF.

04:36:25.635 --> 04:36:26.670
I MEAN IF THERE'S A DO WE KNOW

04:36:26.736 --> 04:36:28.338
WHAT THE NEED IS.

04:36:28.405 --> 04:36:29.806
I THINK IT I THANK YOU THAT'S

04:36:29.873 --> 04:36:31.775
THE HARDSHIP THAT DSS HAS PUT

04:36:31.841 --> 04:36:33.176
FORWARD I THE WE KNOW HOW MANY

04:36:33.243 --> 04:36:34.911
STUDENTS ARE IN THE SYSTEM WE

04:36:34.978 --> 04:36:37.080
KNOW THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT

04:36:37.147 --> 04:36:39.182
THEY WILL LIKELY NEED -- BUT

04:36:39.249 --> 04:36:40.750
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS

04:36:40.817 --> 04:36:42.552
TIME TO KNOW HOW MANY WILL AVAIL

04:36:42.619 --> 04:36:44.454
THEM THEMSELVES OF THIS SERVICE.

04:36:44.521 --> 04:36:47.123
AND WHETHER THAT WILL RAMP UP

04:36:47.190 --> 04:36:48.591
OVER TIME BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW

04:36:48.658 --> 04:36:49.859
THERE'S A NEED FOR APROPOS OF

04:36:49.926 --> 04:36:51.695
OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION ABOUT

04:36:51.761 --> 04:36:53.363
WHETHER TO BANK MONEY HERE TO

04:36:53.430 --> 04:36:54.764
APPROPRIATED AS NEEDED.

04:36:54.831 --> 04:36:55.899
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S TEN

04:36:55.966 --> 04:36:57.100
MILLION DOLLARS SITTING THERE WE

04:36:57.167 --> 04:36:59.302
COULD USE A TEN MILLION DOLLARS

04:36:59.369 --> 04:37:00.837
IT HAS NOT BEEN.

04:37:00.904 --> 04:37:03.239
COMMITTED RIGHT HANDED TO THE

04:37:03.306 --> 04:37:05.608
EXTENT WE ALL WANT TO TAKE CARE

04:37:05.675 --> 04:37:07.344
OF IMMIGRANT LEGAL SERVICES. TO

04:37:07.410 --> 04:37:08.645
THE EXTENT THAT THEN THE NEED

04:37:08.712 --> 04:37:10.380
EXCEEDS TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS

04:37:10.447 --> 04:37:11.414
DURING THE BUDGET YOU'RE THE I

04:37:11.481 --> 04:37:13.650
ASSUME THAT CAN BE A BUDGET

04:37:13.717 --> 04:37:14.851
ADJUSTMENT CORRECT.

04:37:14.918 --> 04:37:16.786
SO IT IS WITHIN PROPOSITION

04:37:16.853 --> 04:37:17.320
NINETY EIGHT SO THERE IS A

04:37:17.387 --> 04:37:19.556
TRADEOFF.

04:37:19.622 --> 04:37:21.024
YES SIR I THINK WHAT WE'RE

04:37:21.091 --> 04:37:22.125
SAYING IS.

04:37:22.192 --> 04:37:23.393
YEAH YEAH IT'S SUBJECT TO

04:37:23.460 --> 04:37:24.427
DISCUSSION OF WHAT'S INCLUDED

04:37:24.494 --> 04:37:26.129
WITHIN THE GUARANTEE BUT YES YOU

04:37:26.196 --> 04:37:27.564

OBERNOLTE.

04:37:34.571 --> 04:37:35.538
THIS IS WHY THE TOPIC OF LAW

04:37:35.605 --> 04:37:36.139
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADJUSTMENTS

04:37:36.206 --> 04:37:37.207
I'D LIKE TO RAISE AN ISSUE THAT

04:37:37.273 --> 04:37:39.376
I THINK NEEDS ATENTION AND THIS

04:37:39.442 --> 04:37:40.410
IS REGARDING SOMETHING THAT.

04:37:40.477 --> 04:37:41.411
APPLE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE

04:37:41.478 --> 04:37:42.645
SENATE GREED ON THE START OF

04:37:42.712 --> 04:37:44.214
THIS YEAR WHICH WAS THE

04:37:44.280 --> 04:37:46.316
EXTENSION OF THE CALIFORNIA --

04:37:46.383 --> 04:37:48.385
COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM TO THE

04:37:48.451 --> 04:37:49.285
SECOND FOR YOUR COMMUNITY

04:37:49.352 --> 04:37:50.854
COLLEGE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

04:37:50.920 --> 04:37:51.955
I VERY MUCH SUPPORT.

04:37:52.022 --> 04:37:54.357
HOWEVER NONE OF THE COLLEGE

04:37:54.424 --> 04:37:54.958
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MY

04:37:55.025 --> 04:37:56.426
DISTRICT WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE

04:37:56.493 --> 04:37:58.161
ADVANTAGE OF THAT THE WAY THAT

04:37:58.228 --> 04:37:59.262
THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY WORDED.

04:37:59.329 --> 04:38:01.131
THE END OF THAT IS BECAUSE THAT

04:38:01.197 --> 04:38:02.932
FUNDING HIM FOR THE FIRST YEAR

04:38:02.999 --> 04:38:04.701
AMENDED ITS AND FAIRNESS THIS IS

04:38:04.768 --> 04:38:06.536
A A PROBLEM WITH -- THE PROGRAM

04:38:06.603 --> 04:38:07.237
LAST YEAR.

04:38:07.303 --> 04:38:08.872
THAT REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES%

04:38:08.938 --> 04:38:10.840
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL

04:38:10.907 --> 04:38:12.208
DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM.

04:38:12.275 --> 04:38:13.643
AS A CONDITION FOR GETTING THAT

04:38:13.710 --> 04:38:15.612
FUNDING AND THE REASON WHY MY

04:38:15.679 --> 04:38:16.980
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAMPER

04:38:17.047 --> 04:38:17.914
DISSIPATE IN THAT FUNDING IN

04:38:17.981 --> 04:38:19.282
THAT PROGRAM IS THAT.

04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:20.950
IF YOU PARTICIPATE IN YOUR

04:38:21.017 --> 04:38:22.552
DEFAULT RATE ON THOSE STUDENT

04:38:22.619 --> 04:38:24.988
LOANS IS TOO HIGH THEN YOU LOSE

04:38:25.055 --> 04:38:25.822
YOUR PELL GRANTS AND MY

04:38:25.889 --> 04:38:27.123
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN'T AFFORD

04:38:27.190 --> 04:38:28.391
TO LOSE THEIR PROGRAMS.

04:38:28.458 --> 04:38:30.193
AND SO NONE OF THEM CAN

04:38:30.260 --> 04:38:32.128
PARTICIPATE AS AND THERE ARE.

04:38:32.195 --> 04:38:33.797
A BUNCH OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES

04:38:33.863 --> 04:38:36.166
AND IS EXACTLY THIS SAME

04:38:36.232 --> 04:38:37.400
OPPOSITION MOST OF THEM IN THE

04:38:37.467 --> 04:38:38.234
INLAND EMPIRE.

04:38:38.301 --> 04:38:40.003
AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S

04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.804
EQUITABLE SO I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE

04:38:40.870 --> 04:38:42.038

04:38:42.105 --> 04:38:43.840
COLLEGE FOR ALL I REALLY THINK.

04:38:43.907 --> 04:38:45.175
THAT WHEN WE WRITE THAT THAT

04:38:45.241 --> 04:38:46.709
INTO THE BUDGET I WOULD REQUEST

04:38:46.776 --> 04:38:48.545
THAT WE WE GET RID OF THAT

04:38:48.611 --> 04:38:49.846
STRING BEING ATTACHED TO IT

04:38:49.913 --> 04:38:51.681
BECAUSE I WOULD BE REALLY NICE

04:38:51.748 --> 04:38:53.616
IF MY CONSTITUENTS GOT FREE

04:38:53.683 --> 04:38:59.689
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

SEE EMPLOYEES SO THAT'S THE

04:46:48.291 --> 04:46:49.859
ABOUT THE UNIVERSE OF OF

04:46:49.926 --> 04:46:52.128
INDIVIDUALS TO BE AFFECTED BY --

04:46:52.194 --> 04:46:53.796
THIS PROPOSAL THE REMAINING YOU

FINANCE LIKE ONE POINT HERE

04:47:03.172 --> 04:47:04.807
WHICH IS THAT THE GOVERNOR --

04:47:04.874 --> 04:47:05.608
INCLUDED THIS IN THE NAY

04:47:05.675 --> 04:47:07.443
REVISION TO REDUCE THE UNFUNDED

04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:09.178
LIABILITY OF THE UC RETIREMENT

04:47:09.245 --> 04:47:10.713
PROGRAMS AND DOESN'T BELIEVE IT

04:47:10.780 --> 04:47:11.847
SHOULD BE TIED TO ANY OTHER

04:47:11.914 --> 04:47:13.382
CONSIDERATIONS PARTICULARLY

04:47:13.449 --> 04:47:15.318
THOSE THAT ARE BETTER ADDRESSED

04:47:15.384 --> 04:47:16.919
THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

04:47:16.986 --> 04:47:18.354

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST A

04:47:22.325 --> 04:47:24.360
FEW THOUGHTS ON A OFFERING A

04:47:24.427 --> 04:47:25.895
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION DOES

04:47:25.962 --> 04:47:28.664
NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT.

04:47:28.731 --> 04:47:30.533
ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF THE

04:47:30.600 --> 04:47:32.101
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN SOMETHING

04:47:32.168 --> 04:47:34.203
IT IS TO BE RESEARCH BY THE BY

04:47:34.270 --> 04:47:35.271
THE SENATE REQUESTED THAT.

04:47:35.338 --> 04:47:36.072
I WOULD JUST SAY THE DEFINED

04:47:36.138 --> 04:47:37.673
BENEFIT PLAN IS NOT A PYRAMID

04:47:37.740 --> 04:47:38.741
SCHEME IT'S NOT RICK.

04:47:38.808 --> 04:47:40.309
BUT DEPEND ON NEW EMPLOYEES

04:47:40.376 --> 04:47:43.512
COMING IN. TO TO PROP IT UP WILL

04:47:43.579 --> 04:47:45.047
ALSO SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY

04:47:45.114 --> 04:47:46.349
CALIFORNIA HAS AN UNRESTRICTED

04:47:46.415 --> 04:47:49.085
NET DEFICIT OF NINETEEN BILLION

04:47:49.151 --> 04:47:50.620
DOLLARS IT'S ALSO.

04:47:50.686 --> 04:47:51.487
A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO TO

04:47:51.554 --> 04:47:54.523
LOOK AT BUT THE DC PLAN A

04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:55.691
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN THAT

04:47:55.758 --> 04:47:57.760
WAS NEGOTIATED WITH JANET NEPAL

04:47:57.827 --> 04:47:59.362
TANO AND JERRY BROWN WAS.

04:47:59.428 --> 04:48:00.229
GOING TO BE PROBABLY ONE OF THE

04:48:00.296 --> 04:48:01.697
FINEST COMPONENTS OF THEIR

04:48:01.764 --> 04:48:03.399
LEGACY.

04:48:03.466 --> 04:48:05.434
AND AND SO I GET NERVOUS OR I

04:48:05.501 --> 04:48:07.503
GET REALLY CONCERNED WHEN IDEAS

04:48:07.570 --> 04:48:09.505
OF MODIFYING.

04:48:09.572 --> 04:48:10.873
OF THAT.

04:48:10.940 --> 04:48:14.610
STRATEGY ARE ARE BROACHED --

04:48:14.677 --> 04:48:17.179
DECADES AGO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

04:48:17.246 --> 04:48:19.081
TRANSITION DATA DEFINED BENEFIT

04:48:19.148 --> 04:48:20.416
PLANS BECAUSE THEY COULD FORDHAM

04:48:20.483 --> 04:48:22.051
AND WE'RE IN A DEFINED

04:48:22.118 --> 04:48:23.152
CONTRIBUTION WORLD IN THE

04:48:23.219 --> 04:48:23.986
PRIVATE SECTOR.

04:48:24.053 --> 04:48:26.455
AND IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WITH

04:48:26.522 --> 04:48:27.757
BEEF THEM UP.

04:48:27.823 --> 04:48:29.558
WHICH IS SORT OF

04:48:29.625 --> 04:48:32.662
COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT GOING

04:48:32.728 --> 04:48:34.764
TOWARDS A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION.

04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:36.932
PLAN IT IS THE PROPER STRATEGY

04:48:36.999 --> 04:48:38.300
FOR ACHIEVING BETTER FINANCIAL

04:48:38.367 --> 04:48:40.202
SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FUTURE FOR

04:48:40.269 --> 04:48:40.803
GONNA DIG OUT OF THIS WHOLE WE

04:48:40.870 --> 04:48:43.105
GOT A START PROVIDING MORE

04:48:43.172 --> 04:48:45.174
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

04:48:45.241 --> 04:48:46.375
BECAUSE IF THE ECONOMY TANKS

04:48:46.442 --> 04:48:47.777
THEN THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

04:48:47.843 --> 04:48:49.679
PLAN TENG'S AND THEN THE PENSION

04:48:49.745 --> 04:48:51.714
CONTRIBUTIONS GO UP WHEN WERE

04:48:51.781 --> 04:48:53.049
CUT THE BUDGET I MEAN IT'S JUST.

04:48:53.115 --> 04:48:55.184
A CONVERGENCE OF TWO TRENDS THAT

04:48:55.251 --> 04:48:58.454
ARE CHEST -- NASTY AND AND A

04:48:58.521 --> 04:49:00.222
BEEN THERE DONE THAT.

04:49:00.289 --> 04:49:01.257
SO CURRENTLY.

04:49:01.323 --> 04:49:03.826
LISA THE LAST NUMBERS I'VE SEEN

04:49:03.893 --> 04:49:04.960
37% OF NEW.

04:49:05.027 --> 04:49:07.463
UC EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING THE DC

04:49:07.530 --> 04:49:08.464
OPTION.

04:49:08.531 --> 04:49:09.832
AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT PERHAPS

04:49:09.899 --> 04:49:10.866
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE

04:49:10.933 --> 04:49:12.234
MILLENNIALS SO THEY HAVE THE

04:49:12.301 --> 04:49:13.703
ABILITY.

04:49:13.769 --> 04:49:15.137
TO TRANSPORT THEM THAT THEY'RE

04:49:15.204 --> 04:49:17.273
THEY'RE THEY'RE PORTABLE SO WHEN

04:49:17.339 --> 04:49:18.274
THEY LEAVE THEY GET THEIR MONEY

04:49:18.340 --> 04:49:19.475
MAKE THE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT

04:49:19.542 --> 04:49:23.112
IN A ROLLOVER IRA.

04:49:23.179 --> 04:49:24.580
WORK OR WHATEVER.

04:49:24.647 --> 04:49:26.015
SENATOR GLAZER ROD.

04:49:26.082 --> 04:49:27.216
PROPOSED A BILL LAST YEAR TO TO

04:49:27.283 --> 04:49:28.451
ALLOW ALL STATE EMPLOYEES TO

04:49:28.517 --> 04:49:29.552
HAVE THE OPTION YOU WANT TO BE A

04:49:29.618 --> 04:49:32.154
DC OR D. B..

04:49:32.221 --> 04:49:35.057
AND THAT BILL FAILED BUT THAT IS

04:49:35.124 --> 04:49:36.792
GOING TO BE I THINK IN THE

04:49:36.859 --> 04:49:37.493
FUTURE THE DIRECTION WE SHOULD

04:49:37.560 --> 04:49:38.394
BE GOING.

04:49:38.461 --> 04:49:39.962
ESPECIALLY FOR FOCUS ON

04:49:40.029 --> 04:49:41.897
FINANCIAL VIABILITY SO SO PLEASE

04:49:41.964 --> 04:49:43.399
PLEASE WE SHOULDN'T BE GOING

04:49:43.466 --> 04:49:45.000
BACK TO ADJUST THE BE FOR

04:49:45.067 --> 04:49:47.069
EVERYBODY -- YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE

04:49:47.136 --> 04:49:48.437
GOT SOMETHING THAT'S WORKING AT

04:49:48.504 --> 04:49:50.606
UC AND IT'S A MODEL.

04:49:50.673 --> 04:49:52.007
FOR THE REST OF THE STATE.

04:49:52.074 --> 04:49:53.109
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS MADAM

04:49:53.175 --> 04:49:54.510
CHAIR THANK YOU AND WE

04:49:54.577 --> 04:49:58.347
APPRECIATE THEM SENATOR ROBB.

04:49:58.414 --> 04:49:59.915
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE

04:49:59.982 --> 04:50:04.954
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- ONE MOVE

04:50:05.020 --> 04:50:06.489
YOUR DECISION HERE.

04:50:06.555 --> 04:50:10.226
OF THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS --

04:50:10.292 --> 04:50:11.427
TO MAKE THE FUNDING CONTINGENT

04:50:11.494 --> 04:50:14.830
ON ELIMINATING THE DEFINED

04:50:14.897 --> 04:50:17.233
CONTRIBUTION OPTION A SENATOR

04:50:17.299 --> 04:50:20.503
AND IT OCCURRED TO US TO ME THAT.

04:50:20.569 --> 04:50:22.471
THE ONLY REASON -- TO DO THAT

04:50:22.538 --> 04:50:24.106
WOULD BE IF THE DEFINED

04:50:24.173 --> 04:50:25.541
CONTRIBUTION PLAN.

04:50:25.608 --> 04:50:27.510
AND THE PARTICIPATION HAD SOME

04:50:27.576 --> 04:50:29.645
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DEFINED

04:50:29.712 --> 04:50:32.181
BENEFIT PLAN BY CAUSING

04:50:32.248 --> 04:50:34.550
EMPLOYEES WHO -- WOULD OTHERWISE

04:50:34.617 --> 04:50:36.719
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PLAN TO FLIP

04:50:36.786 --> 04:50:38.187
TO A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

04:50:38.254 --> 04:50:39.989
SOMEHOW IMPACTING THE DEFINED

04:50:40.055 --> 04:50:42.458
BENEFIT PLAN IF IN FACT IT DID.

04:50:42.525 --> 04:50:44.794
AND SO -- WHAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE

04:50:44.860 --> 04:50:47.830
DECIDED TO DO WAS CONDITION THE --

04:50:47.897 --> 04:50:50.366
THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO A

04:50:50.432 --> 04:50:51.834
DETERMINATION THAT IN FACT THERE

04:50:51.901 --> 04:50:54.203
WOULD BE NO IMPACT ON THE

04:50:54.270 --> 04:50:55.771
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.

04:50:55.838 --> 04:50:57.306
FROM CONTINUING TO DEFINED

04:50:57.373 --> 04:50:59.008
CONTRIBUTION PLAN OPTIONS SO

04:50:59.074 --> 04:51:00.476
THAT'S WHY THIS LANGUAGE WAS

04:51:00.543 --> 04:51:03.045
PREPARED THE WAY IT WAS NOT TO

04:51:03.112 --> 04:51:04.446
PRESUME THAT THERE WAS ANY.

04:51:04.513 --> 04:51:06.849
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DEFINED

04:51:06.916 --> 04:51:07.349
BENEFIT PLAN [inaudible]

04:51:07.416 --> 04:51:09.952
BUT TO SET THE CONDITION FOR THE

04:51:10.019 --> 04:51:11.287
FLOW OF THE MONEY.

04:51:11.353 --> 04:51:13.355
AS OPPOSED TO THE CONDITION

04:51:13.422 --> 04:51:15.057
BEING THE COMPLETE ELIMINATION

04:51:15.124 --> 04:51:15.624
OF THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

04:51:15.691 --> 04:51:17.660
OPTION.

04:51:17.726 --> 04:51:20.262
MAY I RESPOND MADAM CHAIR.

NINE TEN YEARS AGO.

04:51:26.802 --> 04:51:29.705
A CALIFORNIA'S NEGOTIATED -- A

04:51:29.772 --> 04:51:32.508
NEW FEAR FOR ITS EMPLOYEES.

04:51:32.575 --> 04:51:34.276
AND WHO WE SAID YOU KNOW YOU CAN

04:51:34.343 --> 04:51:35.511
HAVE A LOWER.

04:51:35.578 --> 04:51:38.280
FORMULA AND WILL HAVE A DEFINED

04:51:38.347 --> 04:51:40.716

INTO PERCENT WILL PUT INTO

04:51:44.353 --> 04:51:46.522
PERCENT AND AND AND SO WAS A

04:51:46.589 --> 04:51:47.723
HYBRID.

04:51:47.790 --> 04:51:49.725
AND SO THAT THAT WAS AGREED TO

04:51:49.792 --> 04:51:51.560
BY THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS

04:51:51.627 --> 04:51:53.128

BUT WE ALSO NEGOTIATED THAT YOU

04:51:55.831 --> 04:51:57.433
COULD.

04:51:57.500 --> 04:51:58.767
GO OUT OF THE D. B. PLAN INTO

04:51:58.834 --> 04:52:02.004
THE DC PLAN IF YOU IF YOU WANTED.

04:52:02.071 --> 04:52:02.538
TO WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

04:52:02.605 --> 04:52:04.440
REQUEST.

04:52:04.506 --> 04:52:06.375
THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT WE RAN INTO

04:52:06.442 --> 04:52:08.611
INTERNAL REVENUE.

04:52:08.677 --> 04:52:10.946
SERVICE REV RULING TWO THOUSAND

04:52:11.013 --> 04:52:12.681
SIX HIGH FROM.

04:52:12.748 --> 04:52:13.449
FORTY THREE WHICH SAID THAT.

04:52:13.515 --> 04:52:15.417
YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T MOVE INTO

04:52:15.484 --> 04:52:17.419
ANOTHER CLAN.

04:52:17.486 --> 04:52:19.755
YOU ONLY GET ONE CHOICE NOT TO

04:52:19.822 --> 04:52:21.490
AND IF YOU HAVE A SECOND CHOICE

04:52:21.557 --> 04:52:23.259
YOU JEOPARDIZE THE TAX.

04:52:23.325 --> 04:52:25.761
EXEMPT STATUS OF THE DB PLAN.

04:52:25.828 --> 04:52:28.764
AND SO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

04:52:28.831 --> 04:52:30.599
CHANGE THAT REPRESENT. TEN YEARS

04:52:30.666 --> 04:52:33.869
LATER -- THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE

04:52:33.936 --> 04:52:36.472
UNIONS LIKE ASK ME AND S. CI YOU

04:52:36.538 --> 04:52:37.573
AND AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL HAVE

04:52:37.640 --> 04:52:39.108
BEEN PRETTY PERSUASIVE WITH THE

04:52:39.174 --> 04:52:40.242
US TREASURY.

04:52:40.309 --> 04:52:42.444
DEPARTMENT AND THE IRS TO NOT

04:52:42.511 --> 04:52:44.446
CHANGE THAT RECRUIT SO SO RIGHT

04:52:44.513 --> 04:52:45.614
NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN DO THAT

04:52:45.681 --> 04:52:47.917
UNLESS WE HAVE A A MAJOR CHANGE

04:52:47.983 --> 04:52:50.119
IN FEDERAL LAW.

04:52:50.185 --> 04:52:50.753
SO I COULD SAVE YOU A LITTLE BIT

04:52:50.819 --> 04:52:51.687
OF TIME.

04:52:51.754 --> 04:52:52.655
IN DOING A STUDY.

04:52:52.721 --> 04:52:55.491
BASED ON JUST THE THE FUND WE'VE

04:52:55.557 --> 04:52:57.092
HAD AN ORANGE COUNTY.

04:52:57.159 --> 04:52:58.594
MAYBE I STAND I THOUGHT THE THE

04:52:58.661 --> 04:52:59.929
PROPOSAL WAS TO ELIMINATE THE

04:52:59.995 --> 04:53:01.931
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION.

04:53:01.997 --> 04:53:03.832
PLAN OPTION FOR EMPLOYEES RIGHT

04:53:03.899 --> 04:53:05.134
RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST IT'S

04:53:05.200 --> 04:53:06.235
OPTIONAL.

04:53:06.302 --> 04:53:07.770
SO WHEN YOU BECOME AN EMPLOYEE

04:53:07.836 --> 04:53:09.338
OF THE UC SYSTEM YOU CAN SAY DO

04:53:09.405 --> 04:53:10.439
I WON'T BE IN THE DB PLAN OR THE

04:53:10.506 --> 04:53:14.209
DC PLAN RIGHT AND 37% FROM SAID

04:53:14.276 --> 04:53:14.643
WILL TAKE THE DEATH.

04:53:14.710 --> 04:53:15.911
THE CITY.

04:53:15.978 --> 04:53:16.745
BUT IT DOESN'T ELIMINATED THE BE

04:53:16.812 --> 04:53:26.121
PLAN.

04:53:26.188 --> 04:53:27.690
PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE I

04:53:27.756 --> 04:53:29.892
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL I

04:53:29.959 --> 04:53:31.327
THOUGHT THE PROPOSAL WAS

04:53:31.393 --> 04:53:35.030
[inaudible] TO TO NOT INSIST

04:53:35.097 --> 04:53:36.598
THAT A DEFINED BENEFIT DOT

04:53:36.665 --> 04:53:37.733
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN BE

04:53:37.800 --> 04:53:41.503
OFFERED TO REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES.

04:53:41.570 --> 04:53:42.671
YEAH RIGHT YEAH THAT THAT THE

04:53:42.738 --> 04:53:43.539
TICKET HERE THEY WANT TO

04:53:43.605 --> 04:53:45.741
ELIMINATE THE WHOLE PROPOSITION

04:53:45.808 --> 04:53:46.608
WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S A

04:53:46.675 --> 04:53:49.111
WITHOUT A GOOD FISCAL MOVE I

04:53:49.178 --> 04:53:50.846
THINK WE'RE SAYING THE SAME

04:53:50.913 --> 04:53:52.781
THING.

04:53:52.848 --> 04:53:54.183
AND WHAT I SAID WAS I WAS NOT

04:53:54.249 --> 04:53:55.985
PREPARED TO DO THAT.

04:53:56.051 --> 04:53:57.486
UNLESS THERE WAS SOME ADVERSE

04:53:57.553 --> 04:54:00.389
IMPACT ON A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN.

04:54:00.456 --> 04:54:01.357
AND TO MY NEEDS TO SAY THAT

04:54:01.423 --> 04:54:03.425
THERE'S NOT YOU SAY THERE WILL

04:54:03.492 --> 04:54:06.562

EMPLOYEES WHO MOVE IN WHO MOVE

04:54:08.364 --> 04:54:09.665
OUT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN

04:54:09.732 --> 04:54:11.266
BEFORE VESTING.

04:54:11.333 --> 04:54:12.267
USED TO BE THEY HAD TO LEAVE THE

04:54:12.334 --> 04:54:13.769
MONEY IN THE PLAN IS THAT STILL

04:54:13.836 --> 04:54:15.871
THE CASE -- IT DEPENDS ON HOW

04:54:15.938 --> 04:54:17.639
IT'S WORDED BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY

04:54:17.706 --> 04:54:19.308
IF YOU WERE THERE FOR FIVE YEARS

04:54:19.375 --> 04:54:20.376

YOU WOULD YOU WOULD -- LOSE THE

04:54:22.411 --> 04:54:24.279
CONTRIBUTION THAT WAS MADE BY

04:54:24.346 --> 04:54:25.881
THE EMPLOYER BUT YOU WOULD BE

04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:27.816
REIMBURSED FOR THE HIGH FISHING

04:54:27.883 --> 04:54:28.617
YOU MADE SO YOU RUN OUT OF

04:54:28.684 --> 04:54:30.352
POCKET RIGHT AND SO WITH A

04:54:30.419 --> 04:54:32.221
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN.

04:54:32.287 --> 04:54:33.589
IF EMPLOYEES MOVED TO THAT

04:54:33.655 --> 04:54:35.257
INSTEAD OF A DEFINED BENEFIT

04:54:35.324 --> 04:54:37.159
PLAN AND THEY LEAVE.

04:54:37.226 --> 04:54:38.660
BEFORE THE NORMAL FASTING YOU

04:54:38.727 --> 04:54:40.195
LOSE THAT COMPONENT OF THE

04:54:40.262 --> 04:54:42.131
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT'S LEFT

04:54:42.197 --> 04:54:43.165
IN THE PLAN.

04:54:43.232 --> 04:54:47.036
THAT WOULD BE AN ACTUARIAL RIGHT

04:54:47.102 --> 04:54:48.404
I'M XIN CÃM THAT'S WHY WE

04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.604
LET'S.

04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:49.271
THAT'S WHERE WHO HOW MANY PEOPLE

04:54:49.338 --> 04:54:53.842
LEAVE BEFORE THE FIVE YEARS.

04:54:53.909 --> 04:54:55.077
THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE'RE

04:54:55.144 --> 04:54:57.379
CALLING FOR NATURAL NOTICES.

04:54:57.446 --> 04:54:59.848
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.

FROM THE LEGEND WHO'S WHO'S NOW

04:55:20.402 --> 04:55:21.270
AT THE TIME WAS A SUPERVISOR

04:55:21.336 --> 04:55:22.538
DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T

04:55:22.604 --> 04:55:24.706
THINK WE IN A SETTING UP THAT

04:55:24.773 --> 04:55:25.941
MEETING BUT ANYWAY JUST FROM.

04:55:26.008 --> 04:55:28.043
REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE CENTER

04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:31.547
MORE LOCK WAS IT AN EXPERT -- IN

04:55:31.613 --> 04:55:33.082
IN THESE MATTERS.

04:55:33.148 --> 04:55:33.649
IT'S INTERESTING THOUGH I'VE

04:55:33.715 --> 04:55:35.017
GOTTEN AT THE TIME I WAS

04:55:35.084 --> 04:55:35.884
ACTUALLY I WAS A FINANCIAL

04:55:35.951 --> 04:55:37.419
ADVISER ONE POINT TIME IN MY

04:55:37.486 --> 04:55:38.087
LIFE I'M A LITTLE RUSTY ON THAT.

04:55:38.153 --> 04:55:40.189
ON THOSE THINGS NOW BY THE TIME

04:55:40.255 --> 04:55:42.224
I WAS NOT A FAN OF THE DB PLAN

04:55:42.291 --> 04:55:44.460
AT ALL -- IN FACT I WANTED ALL

04:55:44.526 --> 04:55:45.761
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO GO TO A TO

04:55:45.828 --> 04:55:49.264
DC PLAN AND I REMEMBER -- SHUT

04:55:49.331 --> 04:55:50.499
SHALL I DARE SAY THAT WHEN I WAS

04:55:50.566 --> 04:55:51.667
CAMPAIGNING I WAS REMINDED OF

04:55:51.733 --> 04:55:53.235
THAT -- FROM A FEW FROM A FEW

04:55:53.302 --> 04:55:55.170
FOLKS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

04:55:55.237 --> 04:55:57.506
THOUGH I'M NOT OPPOSED TO A TO A

04:55:57.573 --> 04:55:59.675
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN -- THE

04:55:59.741 --> 04:56:01.276
SEMINAL COUNTY IS A THIRTY SEVEN

04:56:01.343 --> 04:56:03.579
ACT COUNTY HAS -- SB SIR AND I

04:56:03.645 --> 04:56:07.182
LEARNED IT OFF A LOT ABOUT DB

04:56:07.249 --> 04:56:09.017
PLANS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

04:56:09.084 --> 04:56:09.952
I LEARNED AND I WANT TO MAKE

04:56:10.018 --> 04:56:10.452
SURE THAT THERE'S SOME

04:56:10.519 --> 04:56:11.120
CLARIFICATION MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN

04:56:11.186 --> 04:56:11.753
HELP ME BECAUSE ON THE SENATE

04:56:11.820 --> 04:56:12.754
PROPOSALTHAT FIRST QUESTION

04:56:12.821 --> 04:56:13.655
THAT'S THERE.

04:56:13.722 --> 04:56:15.457
THAT SAYS TO SUBMIT AN ACTUARIAL

04:56:15.524 --> 04:56:16.525
ANALYSIS VERIFYING THAT OFFERING

04:56:16.592 --> 04:56:18.093
A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OPTION

04:56:18.160 --> 04:56:19.695
DOES NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT

04:56:19.761 --> 04:56:20.395
ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THE

04:56:20.462 --> 04:56:21.897
DEFINED.

04:56:21.964 --> 04:56:23.565
BENEFIT PLAN.

04:56:23.632 --> 04:56:26.502
AND I I THINK IF I IF I HEARD --

04:56:26.568 --> 04:56:28.804
OUT MY MY THE THE LEGEND -- AT

04:56:28.871 --> 04:56:31.673
TALK SAYING THAT -- THAT -- NEW

04:56:31.740 --> 04:56:34.042
EMPLOYEES IT WOULDN'T IT

04:56:34.109 --> 04:56:35.043
WOULDN'T BE HURTFUL BUT BUT IN

04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:37.880
IT IN ACTUALITY WHEN WHEN A WHEN

04:56:37.946 --> 04:56:39.548
THEY'RE WHEN A DEFINED BENEFIT

04:56:39.615 --> 04:56:41.016
PLAN ISN'T PROPERLY FUNDED.

04:56:41.083 --> 04:56:42.651
IN ESSENCE THE EXISTING

04:56:42.718 --> 04:56:45.120
EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY PAYING

04:56:45.187 --> 04:56:47.589
FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE RETIREES

04:56:47.656 --> 04:56:48.457
THE ONLY WAY.

04:56:48.524 --> 04:56:50.025
I'M NOT SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE

04:56:50.092 --> 04:56:51.326
HOW THIS WORKS BETWEEN BUT WITH

04:56:51.393 --> 04:56:52.828
THIS NEW PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE

04:56:52.895 --> 04:56:54.596
HAS AND HOW YOU'RE MOVING PEOPLE

04:56:54.663 --> 04:56:57.633
FROM A DB PLAN OVER TO DC PLAN.

04:56:57.699 --> 04:56:59.034
THAT COULD END UP HAVING A

04:56:59.101 --> 04:57:02.204
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE DB PLAN

04:57:02.271 --> 04:57:03.172
OUT OF YOU CAN CAN HELP ME WITH

04:57:03.238 --> 04:57:05.040
THAT -- CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY TO

04:57:05.107 --> 04:57:07.543
THAT -- FIRST -- WITH REGARDS TO

04:57:07.609 --> 04:57:08.810
THE LEGEND -- I JUST SAY THAT

04:57:08.877 --> 04:57:09.912
WHEN I WAS IN.

04:57:09.978 --> 04:57:10.546
BUSINESS SCHOOL WE DIDN'T DO A

04:57:10.612 --> 04:57:16.618
CASE STUDY ON SENATOR MORLOCK

04:57:16.685 --> 04:57:17.085
BUT WE DID ONE ON HIS

04:57:17.152 --> 04:57:19.888
PREDECESSOR.

04:57:19.955 --> 04:57:22.024
IRAN AGAINST YES.

04:57:22.090 --> 04:57:23.725
READ TO ME -- TO ON THE SPECIFIC

04:57:23.792 --> 04:57:24.593
ISSUE I THINK THE POINT SENATOR

04:57:24.660 --> 04:57:25.460
MORE LIKE IT'S MAKING IS WHEN A

04:57:25.527 --> 04:57:27.396
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IS FUNDED

04:57:27.462 --> 04:57:28.664
PROPERLY -- ANY BENEFIT THAT A

04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:29.631
CRUISE IN THAT YEAR SHOULD BE

04:57:29.698 --> 04:57:31.333
FUNDED IN THAT YEAR AND THEN

04:57:31.400 --> 04:57:32.067
EVERYTHING ELSE BEYOND THAT

04:57:32.134 --> 04:57:33.202
SHOULD BE THROUGH A VEST AND

04:57:33.268 --> 04:57:33.902
RETURNS.

04:57:33.969 --> 04:57:35.604
ON IN PRACTICE -- SOMETIMES WITH

04:57:35.671 --> 04:57:36.605
THE SYSTEMS WE SEEN ON UNFUNDED

04:57:36.672 --> 04:57:38.407
LIABILITY IN IN THE PAST TWENTY

04:57:38.473 --> 04:57:39.775
YEARS AGO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

04:57:39.841 --> 04:57:40.976
OVER FUNDED IN THAT HAS

04:57:41.043 --> 04:57:42.978
FLUCTUATED -- I GUESS I'LL MAKE

04:57:43.045 --> 04:57:44.179
TWO POINTS THOUGH I THINK THE

04:57:44.246 --> 04:57:45.280
FIRST IS THAT.

04:57:45.347 --> 04:57:46.949
WHEN IT COMES TO A SYSTEM THAT

04:57:47.015 --> 04:57:49.718
IS UNFUNDED USUALLY IT'S THE

04:57:49.785 --> 04:57:51.720
EMPLOYER THAT -- STEPS UP AND

04:57:51.787 --> 04:57:53.288
FEELS THAT ACTUARIAL UNFUNDED

04:57:53.355 --> 04:57:55.023
LIABILITY -- AND WE'RE SEEING

04:57:55.090 --> 04:57:56.124
THAT IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE

04:57:56.191 --> 04:57:57.726
HAD I GUESS A COUPLE HOURS AGO

04:57:57.793 --> 04:57:58.961
WHEN IT CAME TO SOME OF THE

04:57:59.027 --> 04:58:00.095
SUPPLEMENTAL CALPERS

04:58:00.162 --> 04:58:01.763
CONTRIBUTIONS THOSE ARE COMING

04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:03.699
FROM -- FUTURE EMPLOYEES THOSE

04:58:03.765 --> 04:58:04.633
ARE ACTUALLY COMING FROM THE

04:58:04.700 --> 04:58:06.401
STATE OR THE EMPLOYER IN THIS

04:58:06.468 --> 04:58:08.337
CASE -- WHEN IT COMES MORE

04:58:08.403 --> 04:58:10.606
SPECIFICALLY TO MONEY IN THE

04:58:10.672 --> 04:58:12.107
SYSTEM AND WHETHER PEOPLE ARE

04:58:12.174 --> 04:58:13.809
LEAVING IT THERE THOSE ARE THE

04:58:13.875 --> 04:58:14.476
TYPES OF THINGS WHERE THERE

04:58:14.543 --> 04:58:16.311
MIGHT BE SOME FLUCTUATIONS BASED

04:58:16.378 --> 04:58:18.046
ON WHETHER THE SYSTEM ALLOWS THE

04:58:18.113 --> 04:58:18.747
MONEY TO BE WATCHED THEIR?

04:58:18.814 --> 04:58:20.015
WHETHER PEOPLE TAKE THE MONEY

04:58:20.082 --> 04:58:21.717
WITH THEM WHAT INTEREST RATE

04:58:21.783 --> 04:58:23.318
YOU'RE SETTING ON PEOPLE WHO

04:58:23.385 --> 04:58:24.820
HAVE INVESTED YET BUT I

04:58:24.886 --> 04:58:25.821
CONTINUES TO ACCUMULATE IN THE

04:58:25.887 --> 04:58:26.622
SYSTEM SO.

04:58:26.688 --> 04:58:27.723
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

04:58:27.789 --> 04:58:29.024
THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME

04:58:29.091 --> 04:58:30.792
STUDY -- BUT THE BROADER POINT

04:58:30.859 --> 04:58:32.361
AND I ENJOYED THIS DISCUSSION AS

04:58:32.427 --> 04:58:33.729
WELL BUT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

04:58:33.795 --> 04:58:35.464
THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

04:58:35.530 --> 04:58:36.598
WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

04:58:36.665 --> 04:58:39.935
MAKE THIS CONTRIBUTION WITHOUT

04:58:40.002 --> 04:58:41.236
WAITING INTO THIS WHOLE DEBATE.

04:58:41.303 --> 04:58:42.804
MANAGER IF I CAN.

04:58:42.871 --> 04:58:43.572
JUST DO USUALLY IN AGAIN I'M A

04:58:43.639 --> 04:58:45.007
LITTLE RUSTY WITH THESE THINGS

04:58:45.073 --> 04:58:46.742
BUT THERE'S THAT FIVE YEAR

04:58:46.808 --> 04:58:48.810
AVERAGE -- AND YEAH WITH THE

04:58:48.877 --> 04:58:51.146
DISCOUNT RATE IS IS DROPPED BY

04:58:51.213 --> 04:58:53.248
THE SYSTEM USUALLY EMPLOYER

04:58:53.315 --> 04:58:54.883
INCREASES THEIR THEIR AND CAUGHT

04:58:54.950 --> 04:58:56.918
THE CONTRIBUTIONS BASED UPON.

04:58:56.985 --> 04:58:58.654
THEM THE EXISTING EMPLOYEES THAT

04:58:58.720 --> 04:59:00.022
THEY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SO I

04:59:00.088 --> 04:59:01.790
GUESS THAT WOULD BE TO ME ONE OF

04:59:01.857 --> 04:59:03.458
THOSE THINGS THAT WOULD BE.

04:59:03.525 --> 04:59:05.093
INTERESTING TO LOOK AT IS IS IS

04:59:05.160 --> 04:59:06.662
WHAT THE THE IMPACT THAT THAT

04:59:06.728 --> 04:59:08.730
WOULD HAVE A BY BY MOVING PEOPLE

04:59:08.797 --> 04:59:10.232
OVER BETWEEN FROM THE DB PLAN

04:59:10.299 --> 04:59:12.434
OVER OVER TO THE DC PLAN IS THAT

04:59:12.501 --> 04:59:13.735
NOT IS THAT NOT TRUE.

04:59:13.802 --> 04:59:14.703
SO I I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:59:14.770 --> 04:59:21.643
YOU'RE SAYING AND SO I THINK

04:59:21.710 --> 04:59:22.277
THERE'S TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT

04:59:22.344 --> 04:59:24.146
FIRST IS WHEN THERE IS AN

04:59:24.212 --> 04:59:24.579
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

04:59:24.646 --> 04:59:25.814
THOSE ARE FOR YEARS THAT HAVE

04:59:25.881 --> 04:59:26.481
ALREADY BEEN WORKED RIGHT IN THE

04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:27.382
PAST AND SO THE WAY THE SYSTEMS

04:59:27.449 --> 04:59:28.317
OFTEN ACCOUNT FOR THAT IS BASED

04:59:28.383 --> 04:59:29.451
ON THEIR PRESENT EMPLOYEES.

04:59:29.518 --> 04:59:30.419
THEY SAID A RATE -- AND THEN THE

04:59:30.485 --> 04:59:31.520
ALLOCATED ON AND YOU SEE THAT ON

04:59:31.586 --> 04:59:32.587
YOUR PAGE ON YOUR PAYCHECK OR

04:59:32.654 --> 04:59:33.955
YOUR PAYSTUB WHEN YOU GET IT.

04:59:34.022 --> 04:59:35.357
BUT THE FACT IS IF YOU HAD FEWER

04:59:35.424 --> 04:59:36.858
EMPLOYEES IT WOULD JUST BE

04:59:36.925 --> 04:59:38.193
BIGGER PER EMPLOYEE SO THAT

04:59:38.260 --> 04:59:40.262
RESPONSIBILITY IS STILL ON THE

04:59:40.329 --> 04:59:41.963
EMPLOYER NO MATTER HOW MANY

04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:43.398
EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE SO.

04:59:43.465 --> 04:59:44.766
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING

04:59:44.833 --> 04:59:46.268
THAT AMOUNT AND IT DOESN'T

04:59:46.335 --> 04:59:48.136
ACTUALLY FLUCTUATE AGAIN THESE

04:59:48.203 --> 04:59:49.338
ARE ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES IF

04:59:49.404 --> 04:59:50.205
YOU KNOW FOR HOW THE PROGRAM

04:59:50.272 --> 04:59:50.639
WORKS.

04:59:50.706 --> 04:59:52.040
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN

04:59:52.107 --> 04:59:53.575
THE PROGRAM -- IT MIGHT BE

04:59:53.642 --> 04:59:55.644
DIFFERENT FOR NEW EMPLOYEES FOR

04:59:55.711 --> 04:59:57.045
OUT IT IS FOR THE STATE FOR

04:59:57.112 --> 04:59:58.647
PEOPLE BEGUN AFTER TWENTY

04:59:58.714 --> 04:59:59.548
THIRTEEN BECAUSE THEY'RE YOUR

04:59:59.614 --> 05:00:01.383
NORMAL COST -- THE RATE IS NOT

05:00:01.450 --> 05:00:03.652
SECTOR BARGAINING BUT FLUCTUATES

05:00:03.719 --> 05:00:04.953
FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE

05:00:05.020 --> 05:00:07.622
EMPLOYEE SO -- IN THAT CASE WHEN

05:00:07.689 --> 05:00:09.224
THE DISCOUNT RATE TO YOUR POINT

05:00:09.291 --> 05:00:10.625
FLUCTUATES THAN BOTH PEOPLE'S

05:00:10.692 --> 05:00:13.228
COST FLUCTUATE BUT THOSE ARE NOT

05:00:13.295 --> 05:00:14.830
FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THOSE

05:00:14.896 --> 05:00:18.700
ARE FOR BENEFITS THAT ACCRUE.

05:00:18.767 --> 05:00:20.135
IN THE PRESENT HERE [inaudible]

05:00:20.202 --> 05:00:22.904
OKAY.

05:00:22.971 --> 05:00:24.706
YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO FUND OF

05:00:24.773 --> 05:00:25.974
THE BENEFIT TOUCH ISN'T THAT

05:00:26.041 --> 05:00:27.376
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING CORRECT YES.

05:00:27.442 --> 05:00:29.244
IT'S A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN SO

05:00:29.311 --> 05:00:31.179
YOU GUARANTEE A BENEFIT TO

05:00:31.246 --> 05:00:32.080
SOMEBODY.

05:00:32.147 --> 05:00:34.282
BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AT THE

05:00:34.349 --> 05:00:36.017
END OF THE RAINBOW YES AND YOU

05:00:36.084 --> 05:00:37.252
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE

05:00:37.319 --> 05:00:38.887
ENOUGH MONEY.

05:00:38.954 --> 05:00:43.125
IN THE BUCKET TO PAY THOSEBENEFITS YES SO YOU FUND TO THE

05:00:43.191 --> 05:00:43.925
BENEFIT.

05:00:43.992 --> 05:00:45.460
SO THAT'S WHY IF THE MARKET

05:00:45.527 --> 05:00:46.895
TANKS.

05:00:46.962 --> 05:00:48.797
IF YOU THE EMPLOYER.

05:00:48.864 --> 05:00:50.399
YOU GET YOUR CHECKBOOK OUT.

05:00:50.465 --> 05:00:52.667
AND FUNDED THE BENEFIT.

05:00:52.734 --> 05:00:54.503
NOW I'M NOT THE CPA NOR MY AN

05:00:54.569 --> 05:00:56.138
ACTUARY BUT THERE THERE'S A WAY

05:00:56.204 --> 05:00:57.806
THEY CALCULATE THAT.

05:00:57.873 --> 05:01:00.342
AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS RIGHT

05:01:00.409 --> 05:01:00.642
[inaudible]

05:01:00.709 --> 05:01:02.043
YEAH.

05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:03.145
NO THAT'S THAT THAT WAS MY

05:01:03.211 --> 05:01:05.580
UNDERSTANDING BUT THAT'S NOT BUT

05:01:05.647 --> 05:01:07.449
I THOUGHT I HEARD SO WHAT AT

05:01:07.516 --> 05:01:07.949
THIS.

05:01:08.016 --> 05:01:09.251
SENATOR ROBB I THINK ACTUALLY --

05:01:09.317 --> 05:01:10.652
IF IF WHAT HE JUST SAID IS

05:01:10.719 --> 05:01:12.120
ACCURATE THEN YES WE'VE ANSWERED

05:01:12.187 --> 05:01:14.790
MY QUESTION THIS MY

05:01:14.856 --> 05:01:15.991
UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU.

05:01:16.057 --> 05:01:17.058
THE FRONT YOU PAY YOU PAY THE

05:01:17.125 --> 05:01:17.626
BENEFIT OUT THE BENEFIT I A

05:01:17.692 --> 05:01:18.860
DEFINED BENEFIT SO WHATEVER IS

05:01:18.927 --> 05:01:20.362
HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY UNDER

05:01:20.429 --> 05:01:22.397
CALIFORNIA LAW IS PRESENTLY

05:01:22.464 --> 05:01:23.732
INTERPRETED THAT IS.

05:01:23.799 --> 05:01:25.167
THAT BENEFIT IS PAID OUT TO BE

05:01:25.233 --> 05:01:27.135
READ TO THE RETIREE I THINK

05:01:27.202 --> 05:01:27.669
YOU'RE MAKING AT SOME A

05:01:27.736 --> 05:01:29.471
DIFFERENT POINT ALSO WHICH IS

05:01:29.538 --> 05:01:30.939
THAT.

05:01:31.006 --> 05:01:32.340
IT'S ALL BEING PAID OUT OF THAT

05:01:32.407 --> 05:01:34.209
YOU KNOW CALPERS HAS THREE

05:01:34.276 --> 05:01:35.043
HUNDRED AND SOME ODD BILLION

05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:36.611
DOLLARS AND THAT LEVEL WAS

05:01:36.678 --> 05:01:38.013
FLUCTUATING BASED ON THE MARKET.

05:01:38.079 --> 05:01:39.748
IT'S ALSO FLUCTUATING BASED ON

05:01:39.815 --> 05:01:41.049
HOW MANY PEOPLE AE PAYING AND

05:01:41.116 --> 05:01:42.851
PAYING OUT SO THERE ARE

05:01:42.918 --> 05:01:43.685
DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT

05:01:43.752 --> 05:01:45.754
SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT MORE

05:01:45.821 --> 05:01:46.988
PEOPLE ARE PAYING INTO CALPERS

05:01:47.055 --> 05:01:48.490
THAN YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THERE IS

05:01:48.557 --> 05:01:50.792
MORE MONEY IN THAT FUND AND SO

05:01:50.859 --> 05:01:52.494
MONIES GOING OUT IN MONIES GOING

05:01:52.561 --> 05:01:53.562
AND BUT SENATOR MORE LIKE IS

05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:54.496
ALSO.

05:01:54.563 --> 05:01:56.298
CORRECT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

05:01:56.364 --> 05:01:58.400
PAYING AND MONEY IF THE DISCOUNT

05:01:58.467 --> 05:02:00.135
RATE IS SET APPROPRIATELY THEY

05:02:00.202 --> 05:02:02.037
ARE FINDING THEIR OWN RETIREMENT

05:02:02.103 --> 05:02:05.507
AND NOT NECESSARILY OTHERS

05:02:05.574 --> 05:02:07.209
RETIREMENT.

05:02:07.275 --> 05:02:08.443
MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN ASK THIS

05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:09.744
ONE OF COURSE THE CURRENT FUNDED --

05:02:09.811 --> 05:02:14.483
RATIO FOR THE UC SYSTEM.

05:02:14.549 --> 05:02:16.051
EACH OF OCT WE HAVE THESE.

05:02:16.117 --> 05:02:17.252
KURT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT

05:02:17.319 --> 05:02:17.886

05:02:21.389 --> 05:02:22.324
FUNDED.

05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:24.860
WHICH IS GOOD LEAVING AT TEN

05:02:24.926 --> 05:02:29.431
BILLION DOLLAR OF TAX LIABILITY

05:02:29.498 --> 05:02:29.731
FAIRLY GOOD.

05:02:29.798 --> 05:02:31.199

THAT'S A REGION TOLD YOU KNOW

05:02:50.685 --> 05:02:52.420
DISCUSSION.

05:02:52.487 --> 05:02:54.456
ON HEALTHCARE BENEFITS.

05:03:10.505 --> 05:03:11.273
MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME

SEISMIC RENOVATIONS AT THE UC.

05:03:16.344 --> 05:03:18.313
ALL THE WAY THIS WOULD WORK IS --

05:03:18.380 --> 05:03:20.048
THE CAMPUS AT CAMPUSES RIVER

05:03:20.115 --> 05:03:22.083
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE

05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.651
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THERE

05:03:22.717 --> 05:03:24.653
WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION OF A OF

05:03:24.719 --> 05:03:30.559
A MATCH WITH NON STATE FUNDING --

05:03:30.625 --> 05:03:31.426
THAT ACCORDING TO STAFFTHE

05:03:31.493 --> 05:03:32.694
INTENTION OF THE PROPOSAL IS --

05:03:32.761 --> 05:03:34.296

IT'S A GREAT EVASIONS ARE

05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:42.771
REASONABLE USE OF ONE TIME

05:03:42.837 --> 05:03:43.805
FUNDING THAT SAID WE RAISE TWO

05:03:43.872 --> 05:03:45.473
ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

05:03:45.540 --> 05:03:46.541
CONSIDER IS IT'S WEIGHING THIS

05:03:46.608 --> 05:03:49.077
PROPOSAL AGAINST OTHER ONE TIME

05:03:49.144 --> 05:03:50.178

THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE HAS --

05:03:51.212 --> 05:03:52.280

ON TO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

05:04:05.126 --> 05:04:05.994
TO UNDERSTAND HOW HOW THIS NEW

PILOT WOULD INTERACT WITH THOSE

05:04:08.630 --> 05:04:10.398
EXISTING PROCESSES.

05:04:10.465 --> 05:04:11.967
AND SECOND WE KNOW THAT AND SOME

05:04:12.033 --> 05:04:13.735
CASES CAMPUSES DO ALREADY MATCH

05:04:13.802 --> 05:04:14.469
STATE FUNDING WITH NON STATE

05:04:14.536 --> 05:04:16.538

SEISMIC RENOVATIONS SO FOR

05:04:27.749 --> 05:04:28.783
EXAMPLE IN THIS YEAR THE STATE

PROJECT WOULD BE FUNDED WITH IN

05:04:38.360 --> 05:04:39.127
THIS EXISTING PRACTICE FROM A

05:04:39.194 --> 05:04:40.962
LEGIT LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

05:04:41.029 --> 05:04:42.130
CONSIDER WHAT ADDITIONAL.

05:04:42.197 --> 05:04:44.633

05:05:32.981 --> 05:05:33.982
DE.

05:05:34.049 --> 05:05:36.384
WHEN ELLIE -- RESPONSE THAT THE

05:05:36.451 --> 05:05:39.888

THE UC BUILDINGS THAT ARE NOT UP

05:05:56.604 --> 05:05:58.206
TO ASSIST THE THE SEISMIC CODE

05:05:58.273 --> 05:06:02.410
THAT WE WOULD EXPECT TODAY -- IS

05:06:02.477 --> 05:06:05.547
BEYOND ANYTHING THAT WE EITHER

05:06:05.613 --> 05:06:07.415
HAVE BONDS OR CAPITAL AT LEE AND

05:06:07.482 --> 05:06:10.118
IN FACT THE AS A LEGISLATURE WE

05:06:10.185 --> 05:06:13.021
HAVE NOT PROVIDED YOU SEE VERY

05:06:13.088 --> 05:06:17.726
MUCH CAPITAL MONIES -- SO I MEAN

05:06:17.792 --> 05:06:18.693
IT.

YEAH WE MAY HAVE SOME MECHANISMS

05:06:20.595 --> 05:06:21.996
BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T BEEN.

CAPITAL NEEDS AT ANY RATE THAT

05:06:28.503 --> 05:06:31.639
IS NEEDED. FOR YEARS AND FOR THE

05:06:31.706 --> 05:06:36.177
SEISMIC NEED -- WE HAVE I'M SURE

05:06:36.244 --> 05:06:37.545
MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW

05:06:37.612 --> 05:06:39.914
CAMPUSES THAT ARE DIRECTLY ON

05:06:39.981 --> 05:06:41.349
FAULTS I MEAN LITERALLY THE

05:06:41.416 --> 05:06:43.017
HAYWARD FAULT RUNS THROUGH THE

MANY OF OUR OTHER UC CAMPUSES --

05:07:07.776 --> 05:07:15.917

05:07:19.554 --> 05:07:21.089
REQUEST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN

05:07:21.156 --> 05:07:23.091
ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD BE ABLE

05:07:23.158 --> 05:07:24.926

I MIGHT HAVE SOME MINUTES

05:07:34.202 --> 05:07:35.436
EARLIER MISSION JUST TO HELP --

05:07:35.503 --> 05:07:36.671
YEAH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

05:07:36.738 --> 05:07:38.039
WERE RAISED THE FIRST WITH

05:07:38.106 --> 05:07:38.640
QUESTION WAS JUST ON GENERAL

05:07:38.706 --> 05:07:39.407
NEED.

05:07:39.474 --> 05:07:41.209
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK OF

05:07:41.276 --> 05:07:42.710
THIS I I DON'T I HAVEN'T SEEN

05:07:42.777 --> 05:07:43.745
THE LANGUAGE -- BUT IF IT'S IF

05:07:43.812 --> 05:07:45.213
THAT'S ASSUMING THERE'S A ONE TO

05:07:45.280 --> 05:07:45.814
ONE MATCH YOU'RE LOOKING AT

05:07:45.880 --> 05:07:48.049
MAYBE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

05:07:48.116 --> 05:07:49.584
IN TOTAL THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE.

05:07:49.651 --> 05:07:50.819
FOR SEISMIC RENOVATIONS NOT

05:07:50.885 --> 05:07:52.287
GETTING ABOUT IT'S ABOUT FIVE TO

05:07:52.353 --> 05:07:54.756
MAYBE TEN PROJECTS -- IN THE

05:07:54.823 --> 05:07:56.191
UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY STUDYING

05:07:56.257 --> 05:07:57.425
AT SEISMIC NEEDS ITS

05:07:57.492 --> 05:07:59.160
IMPLEMENTING KIND OF A A STUDY

05:07:59.227 --> 05:08:01.529
THAT IT'S ABOUT 70% DONE WITH

05:08:01.596 --> 05:08:02.831
AND SO ONCE IT'S COME CONCLUDED

05:08:02.897 --> 05:08:03.631
WITH THAT STUDY WOULD MIGHT AND

05:08:03.698 --> 05:08:04.866
WE MAY HAVE A KIND OF BROADER

05:08:04.933 --> 05:08:06.935
SENSE OF THE OVERALL NEED ACROSS

05:08:07.001 --> 05:08:07.769
THE SYSTEM.

05:08:07.836 --> 05:08:08.369
BOTH HOUSES ALSO ADOPT

05:08:08.436 --> 05:08:10.171
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE

05:08:10.238 --> 05:08:11.573
THAT WOULD HAVE A REQUIRE UNIT

05:08:11.639 --> 05:08:13.041
YOU UNIVERSITY TO STUDY AT

05:08:13.107 --> 05:08:14.642
SEISMIC NEEDS SO THE LEGISLATURE

05:08:14.709 --> 05:08:16.110
IS EXPECTING THE UNIVERSITY TO

05:08:16.177 --> 05:08:16.778
COME BACK WITH THE FULLER

05:08:16.845 --> 05:08:18.713
ASSESSMENT OF THOSE NEEDS ACROSS

05:08:18.780 --> 05:08:19.380
THE SYSTEM.

05:08:19.447 --> 05:08:20.281
AND THEN JUST TO THAT A SECOND

05:08:20.348 --> 05:08:21.216
QUESTION ABOUT THE EXISTING

05:08:21.282 --> 05:08:22.617
PROCESS THE WITH EXISTING

05:08:22.684 --> 05:08:24.485
PROCESS WORKS AS THE UNIVERSITY

05:08:24.552 --> 05:08:25.720
RAISES BONTA USES THE GENERAL

05:08:25.787 --> 05:08:27.255
FUND TO PAY BACK THE ASSOCIATED

05:08:27.322 --> 05:08:28.156
DEBT.

05:08:28.223 --> 05:08:29.624
ON THE UNIVERSITY CURRENTLY USES

05:08:29.691 --> 05:08:31.025
THOSE BONDS FOR WRITING PROJECTS

05:08:31.092 --> 05:08:32.193
INCLUDE NEW BUILDINGS AND THEY

05:08:32.260 --> 05:08:33.795
ALSO INCLUDE SEISMIC RENOVATIONS%

05:08:33.862 --> 05:08:39.701
ANOTHER SORT OF SORTS OF THINGS

05:08:39.767 --> 05:08:40.301
LIKE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR

05:08:40.368 --> 05:08:42.637
EXAMPLE. ONE ISSUE THAT -- IT IS

05:08:42.704 --> 05:08:43.204
RAISED EACH YEAR IS HOW THE

05:08:43.271 --> 05:08:44.405
UNIVERSITY PRIORITIZES ALL THESE

05:08:44.472 --> 05:08:45.506
DIFFERENT NEEDS AND ROMAN GROWTH

05:08:45.573 --> 05:08:46.541
SEISMIC NEEDS -- AND UNIVERSITY

05:08:46.608 --> 05:08:47.308
RIGHT NOW TRIES TO WORK WITH THE

05:08:47.375 --> 05:08:48.009
CAMPUS IS TO IDENTIFY THEIR

05:08:48.076 --> 05:08:49.611
HIGHEST NEEDS AND SOMETIMES THAT

05:08:49.677 --> 05:08:50.478
MEANS THAT.

05:08:50.545 --> 05:08:51.479
THEY FIND ENROLLMENT GROWTH

05:08:51.546 --> 05:08:53.081
ANOTHER YEARS IT WILL PROJECTS

05:08:53.147 --> 05:08:53.948
THAT SUPPORTED WOMAN GROWTH A

05:08:54.015 --> 05:08:55.183
NEW FACILITY SOMETIMES THAT

05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:56.384
MEANS THERE SEISMIC RENOVATIONS

05:08:56.451 --> 05:08:57.986
IT KIND OF VARIES BY CAMPUS SO

05:08:58.052 --> 05:08:58.653
THERE HAVE BEEN.

05:08:58.720 --> 05:09:00.288
A SOME SEISMIC PROJECTS OVERALL

05:09:00.355 --> 05:09:01.689
BUT THERE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT

05:09:01.756 --> 05:09:03.691
THEY'VE ADDRESSED -- THAT FULLY

05:09:03.758 --> 05:09:04.692
MEDIA ESPECIALLY IN OLDER

05:09:04.759 --> 05:09:08.062
CAMPUSES WERE YOU HAVE -- OLDER

05:09:08.129 --> 05:09:09.764
FACILITIES.

I MEAN WE HEARD.

05:09:13.635 --> 05:09:14.669
WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF

05:09:14.736 --> 05:09:16.437
DISCUSSION ABOUT DEFERRED

05:09:16.504 --> 05:09:18.706
MAINTENANCE AND AS I RECALL IN

05:09:18.773 --> 05:09:20.041
THE UC SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT A

05:09:20.108 --> 05:09:21.109
LITTLE OVER FOUR BILLION OR

05:09:21.175 --> 05:09:23.011
SOMETHING IN THE CSU SYSTEM IT'S

05:09:23.077 --> 05:09:25.046
A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE OVER

05:09:25.113 --> 05:09:26.447
FOUR BILLION SO IT'S TOTAL

05:09:26.514 --> 05:09:28.349
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE

05:09:28.416 --> 05:09:29.851
BILLION DOLLARS. FOR DEFERRED

05:09:29.918 --> 05:09:30.518
MAINTENANCE AND WHEN I ASKED THE

05:09:30.585 --> 05:09:31.386
QUESTION.

05:09:31.452 --> 05:09:32.420
AS TO WHETHER SEISMIC WAS

05:09:32.487 --> 05:09:34.689
INCLUDED IN THAT -- AS I RECALL

05:09:34.756 --> 05:09:37.292
THE ANSWER WAS NOT -- HENCE THE

05:09:37.358 --> 05:09:38.927
NEED FOR THE STUDY IN MY

05:09:38.993 --> 05:09:40.895
REQUESTED.

05:09:40.962 --> 05:09:41.863
TO INSTEAD OF TWENTY THIRTY THAT

05:09:41.930 --> 05:09:43.298
IT SPEED UP A LITTLE BIT AND WE

05:09:43.364 --> 05:09:45.066
GET AN IDEA AND A HANDLE ON WHAT

05:09:45.133 --> 05:09:47.568
THE TOTAL SEISMIC NEED IS SO WE

05:09:47.635 --> 05:09:48.970
CAN ADD THAT TO THE EIGHT OR

05:09:49.037 --> 05:09:51.539
NINE BILLION AND THEN FIGURE OUT

05:09:51.606 --> 05:09:53.207
HOW WE'RE GOING TO FUND IT.

05:09:53.274 --> 05:09:54.342
AS A STATE SO THIS SOUNDS LIKE

05:09:54.409 --> 05:09:55.810
THIS IS A PRETTY OOD START BUT

05:09:55.877 --> 05:09:57.178
WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO WHEN

SELECTING REGION'S LARGEST STUDY

05:13:57.018 --> 05:13:58.753

NEED EXISTS FOR A NEW CAMPUS FOR

05:14:05.259 --> 05:14:06.727
EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

05:14:06.794 --> 05:14:08.596
LOOK AT FACTORS SUCH AS LOW

05:14:08.663 --> 05:14:11.132

AS FACTORS THE LEGISLATURE COULD

05:14:16.604 --> 05:14:18.239
THEN DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S

LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO GO WITH

05:14:31.085 --> 05:14:32.486
THE REGIONAL STUDY APPROACH --

05:14:32.553 --> 05:14:34.155
STATEWIDE APPROACH WE WOULD JUST

05:14:34.222 --> 05:14:35.823
NOTE THAT EVEN ONE CAMPUS WOULD

05:14:35.890 --> 05:14:38.726
INCREASE CONSIDERABLY BE OUT

YOUR COSTS ARE YOU HAPPY. ONE

05:14:40.828 --> 05:14:44.465

TO OPERATE A CAMPUS WHICH ARE

05:14:46.400 --> 05:14:48.970
QUITE A BIT HIGHER -- FOR YOU

05:14:49.036 --> 05:14:51.205
CAMPUS AS OPPOSED -- TO EXISTING

HIGHER COSTS RIGHT NO QUESTION.

05:15:00.615 --> 05:15:01.382

05:15:01.449 --> 05:15:02.450
THEY SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

05:15:02.516 --> 05:15:04.452
FOCUSES ON SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY

05:15:04.518 --> 05:15:06.320
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOCAL LEADERS

05:15:06.387 --> 05:15:07.321
IN THE STOCKTON AREA WHO ARE

05:15:07.388 --> 05:15:09.056
REALLY INVESTED.

05:15:09.123 --> 05:15:10.725
IN THIS STUDY AND SO THE

05:15:10.791 --> 05:15:12.260
GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:15:12.326 --> 05:15:17.498
THAT DOES HAVE AN EMPHASIS.

05:15:17.565 --> 05:15:20.368
THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

ORANGE COUNTY -- ONE OF THE

05:15:24.272 --> 05:15:24.705
THINGS THAT WE INITIATED

05:15:24.772 --> 05:15:26.007
SUBSEQUENT TO THE BANKRUPTCY

05:15:26.073 --> 05:15:26.874
FILING WAS A TEN YEAR STRATEGIC

05:15:26.941 --> 05:15:27.908
FINANCIAL PLAN.

05:15:27.975 --> 05:15:30.778
SO WE COULD SEE WERE GOING WHAT

05:15:30.845 --> 05:15:32.980
WHAT WHAT A DECISION TODAY.

05:15:33.047 --> 05:15:33.614
HOW WOULD IT IMPACT IS TEN YEARS

05:15:33.681 --> 05:15:34.882
OUT?

05:15:34.949 --> 05:15:36.284
AND SO.

05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:39.186

ARE NOT GONNA DO THAT FOR YOU.

05:15:52.566 --> 05:15:53.267
SO IT'S A LITTLE INTERESTING

05:15:53.334 --> 05:15:54.368
THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK

05:15:54.435 --> 05:15:56.103
AT A NEW CAMPUS BUT WE DON'T

05:15:56.170 --> 05:15:57.938
EVEN HAVE A TEN YEAR.

05:15:58.005 --> 05:15:59.340

OTHERWISE WE'RE LOOKING AT

05:16:25.733 --> 05:16:27.735
MASSIVE TUITION INCREASES RIGHT

05:16:27.802 --> 05:16:29.603
WHICH ARE UNTENABLE SO I'M.

05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:31.972
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

05:16:32.039 --> 05:16:34.075

05:17:05.973 --> 05:17:08.609
WHAT'S THE TEN YEAR PLAN IS NOT

05:17:08.676 --> 05:17:11.178
THAT LONG -- IN IN SO -- BUT I

05:17:11.245 --> 05:17:12.046
JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD

05:17:12.113 --> 05:17:12.646
THAT WE NEED TO START DOING A

05:17:12.713 --> 05:17:14.048
LITTLE MORE.

05:17:14.115 --> 05:17:15.583
THINKING AHEAD ON HOW IT ALL

05:17:15.649 --> 05:17:17.385
FITS IN AND SO WE DON'T LEAVE A

05:17:17.451 --> 05:17:20.054
MESS TO THOSE TO SUCCEED IS

05:17:20.121 --> 05:17:20.354
[inaudible]

05:17:20.421 --> 05:17:22.823
MR MAYES.

05:17:22.890 --> 05:17:25.092
REALLY LOVE THE ASSEMBLY MAP OF

05:17:25.159 --> 05:17:27.595
A PLAN -- HERE COULD BE -- THAT

05:17:27.661 --> 05:17:29.330
THERE IS A THE PALM DESERT IS IN

05:17:29.397 --> 05:17:31.832
HERE -- I DO KNOW ON OUR SIDE

05:17:31.899 --> 05:17:34.235
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF US MEMBERS --

05:17:34.301 --> 05:17:36.670
WHO HAVE THIS AMBITION OF HAVING

05:17:36.737 --> 05:17:39.673
FULL FLEDGED CAMPUSES?

05:17:39.740 --> 05:17:42.276
BUT TO CENTER MORE LOCKS POINT

05:17:42.343 --> 05:17:44.378
WE REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE THIS --

05:17:44.445 --> 05:17:46.747
THIS GOAL IN THIS PLAN FOR ALL

05:17:46.814 --> 05:17:48.682
OVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE FOUR AND

05:17:48.749 --> 05:17:49.683
A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN THE

05:17:49.750 --> 05:17:50.785
INLAND EMPIRE.

05:17:50.851 --> 05:17:52.319
WE DO HAVE ARE YOU SEE WE ALSO

05:17:52.386 --> 05:17:54.622
HAVE CAL STATE MAKES SENSE FOR

05:17:54.688 --> 05:17:56.056
THERE TO BE ONE AND IN PALM

05:17:56.123 --> 05:17:58.192
DESERT YET IF YOU LOOK AT THIS

05:17:58.259 --> 05:17:59.794
SHOULD NOT BE WANTED TO THIS --

05:17:59.860 --> 05:18:01.562
NOT ONE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY OF

05:18:01.629 --> 05:18:03.831
COURSE THE ONE THAT I KNOW THAT --

05:18:03.898 --> 05:18:05.065
DOCTOR AGAIN IS LOOKING -- FOR

05:18:05.132 --> 05:18:07.067
IN IN IN STOCKTON AND SO THIS

05:18:07.134 --> 05:18:08.836
IDEA OF DOING A COMPREHENSIVE A

05:18:08.903 --> 05:18:11.839
PLAN OF WHERE THOSE NEXT --

05:18:11.906 --> 05:18:13.674
BUSINESS NEXT THE FULL

05:18:13.741 --> 05:18:14.542
INDEPENDENT ACCOUNT STATES ARE

05:18:14.608 --> 05:18:16.143
GOING TO BE I THINK MAKES AN

05:18:16.210 --> 05:18:18.879
AWFUL LOT AS A LOT OF SENSE.

05:18:18.946 --> 05:18:20.448
THE REASON IM I LIKE THE

05:18:20.514 --> 05:18:22.450
SPELLING OUT WHERE THE BOAT

05:18:22.516 --> 05:18:23.083
WE'RE GONNA DO THE STUDYING IS

05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:24.351
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE CAL

05:18:24.418 --> 05:18:25.820
STATE SYSTEM HAS THEIR OWN

05:18:25.886 --> 05:18:26.454
CONSTITUENCY.

05:18:26.520 --> 05:18:27.655
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLITICAL

05:18:27.721 --> 05:18:30.191
DYNAMICS AND AND THEY THEY

05:18:30.257 --> 05:18:31.959
OFTENTIMES WANT TO KEEP

05:18:32.026 --> 05:18:32.893
EVERYTHING ON THEIR CAR WHERE

05:18:32.960 --> 05:18:33.961
THEIR CURRENT CAMPUSES ARE OUT

05:18:34.028 --> 05:18:35.930
THEY DON'T WANT EXPAND JUST FOR

05:18:35.996 --> 05:18:36.664
THOSE REASONS THEY GOT LIMITED

05:18:36.730 --> 05:18:38.966
RESOURCES THEY GOT BIG AMBITIONS.

05:18:39.033 --> 05:18:40.568
TO TO SPEND MONEY THERE I THINK

05:18:40.634 --> 05:18:41.669
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE

05:18:41.735 --> 05:18:42.870
TO LOOK AT TO LIST THESE AND I

05:18:42.937 --> 05:18:44.405
THINK IT MAKES SENSE. FOR US TO

05:18:44.472 --> 05:18:53.414
CONSIDER THOSE FOUR SITES THANK

05:18:53.481 --> 05:18:57.017
YOU BACK TO WHEREVER I WAS -- IT

05:18:57.084 --> 05:18:58.052
OUGHT. TO LIVE THIS IS DOWN

05:18:58.118 --> 05:18:58.719
THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY'VE GIVEN

05:18:58.786 --> 05:19:02.223
THE GAS ALMOST. THREE HUNDRED

05:19:02.289 --> 05:19:02.790
THREE HUNDRED BEGIN ACRES OF

05:19:02.857 --> 05:19:03.858
LAND TO BUILD THE CAMPUS FREE TO

05:19:03.924 --> 05:19:06.494
STATE SO ANALYSTS AT BEAUTIFUL

05:19:06.560 --> 05:19:06.827
AND IN FACT.

05:19:06.894 --> 05:19:08.262
BUT THE ARE CHALLENGES CONTINUES

05:19:08.329 --> 05:19:08.863
TO BE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

05:19:08.929 --> 05:19:09.063
PLAN.

05:19:09.129 --> 05:19:09.964
AND WE DON'T AND SO THERE FOR

05:19:10.030 --> 05:19:11.098
EVERYBODY WHO WANTS SOMETHING

05:19:11.165 --> 05:19:12.333
HAS A TENDENCY TO THROW IN TO

05:19:12.399 --> 05:19:13.300
TRY TO GET IT AND AND TO KIND OF

05:19:13.367 --> 05:19:14.168
PUSH FOURTH.

05:19:14.235 --> 05:19:15.236
WE NEED A HIGHER IT COMMISSION

05:19:15.302 --> 05:19:17.338
THAT LIKE WE USED TO HAVE THAT

05:19:17.404 --> 05:19:18.205
WOULD DEAL WITH THE SOMETIMES

05:19:18.272 --> 05:19:19.507
THE PLANET MASS THAT WOULD WRITE

05:19:19.573 --> 05:19:21.775
THE MASTER PLAN TO DEAL WITH AND

05:19:21.842 --> 05:19:23.077
ROLL MY CHANGES AND ALL THE

05:19:23.143 --> 05:19:24.545
STUFF WE TRIED WE TRIED IT FOR

05:19:24.612 --> 05:19:26.146
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

05:19:26.213 --> 05:19:28.849
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PROPOSAL

05:19:28.916 --> 05:19:31.118
TO HAD TO DO SEE PACKING YET AND

05:19:31.185 --> 05:19:32.987
BOB PAST GOVERNOR ALWAYS VETOED

05:19:33.053 --> 05:19:34.221
IT BECAUSE HE GOT RID OF IT AND

05:19:34.288 --> 05:19:35.689
DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK.

05:19:35.756 --> 05:19:37.591
BUT I THINK THERE MAY BE ONE OR

05:19:37.658 --> 05:19:39.093
TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION

05:19:39.159 --> 05:19:40.694
FLOATING AROUND NOW HOPEFULLY

05:19:40.761 --> 05:19:41.862
THAT MAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S

05:19:41.929 --> 05:19:43.497
DESK THAT MAY ONCE AGAIN

05:19:43.564 --> 05:19:45.065
ESTABLISHED THIS HIGHER IT

05:19:45.132 --> 05:19:45.666
COMMISSION.

05:19:45.733 --> 05:19:46.967
THAT WHOSE JOB WOULD BE TO DO

05:19:47.034 --> 05:19:48.569
THAT AND THEREFORE YOU TAKE A

05:19:48.636 --> 05:19:50.170
LOT OF THE POLITICS OUT OF IT.

05:19:50.237 --> 05:19:51.438
BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT

05:19:51.505 --> 05:19:53.707
ENROLLMENT TRANS CURRICULUM WHAT

05:19:53.774 --> 05:19:55.376
KINDS OF DEGREES UNNECESSARY SO

05:19:55.442 --> 05:19:56.844
FORTH AND SO ON WERE YOU GOING

05:19:56.911 --> 05:19:58.178
TO FIND IT WHERE YOU LOCATED AND

05:19:58.245 --> 05:19:59.413
THAT'S HOW YOU.

05:19:59.480 --> 05:20:00.614
YOU DEVELOP A PLAN THAT'S HOW

05:20:00.681 --> 05:20:02.449
YOU GET ON THE LIST BUT TEN

05:20:02.516 --> 05:20:04.251
YEARS TO GET SAN MARCOS SO WHERE

05:20:04.318 --> 05:20:05.352
PEOPLE OR WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING

05:20:05.419 --> 05:20:07.087
TO BE BUT IT JUST TAKES A

05:20:07.154 --> 05:20:08.789
POLITICS OUT OF IT AND AS A

05:20:08.856 --> 05:20:10.558
RESULT IT FOCUSES ON WHERE THE

05:20:10.624 --> 05:20:10.858
NEEDS ARE.

05:20:10.925 --> 05:20:12.993
WITH THE ENROLLMENT IS YOU KNOW

05:20:13.060 --> 05:20:13.794
WITH THE GROWTH MAY BE IN EVEN

05:20:13.861 --> 05:20:16.130
IN AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A

05:20:16.196 --> 05:20:19.767
CAMPUS LIKE -- IN COACHELLA YOU

05:20:19.833 --> 05:20:21.101
KNOW THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS

05:20:21.168 --> 05:20:23.037
THAT THE DATA SHOW THAT PROBABLY

05:20:23.103 --> 05:20:24.605
THERE'S NOT POPULATION ENOUGH TO

05:20:24.672 --> 05:20:26.073
TO HAVE A CAMPUS -- THEY DO NEED

05:20:26.140 --> 05:20:27.374
TO COMMUNICATE ALLEGE THAT THEY

05:20:27.441 --> 05:20:29.043
DO NEED SOME OTHER KINDS OF

05:20:29.109 --> 05:20:29.810
THEORIES SAID THIS SO.

05:20:29.877 --> 05:20:30.711
YOU KNOW BUT I JUST THINK --

05:20:30.778 --> 05:20:31.845
HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET SOMETHING

05:20:31.912 --> 05:20:33.714
THAT WILL GIVE US MORE THAN JUST

05:20:33.781 --> 05:20:35.683
EVERY NOW AND THEN WE CAN GET

05:20:35.749 --> 05:20:36.917
TWO MILLION DOLLARS A BILL STUDY

05:20:36.984 --> 05:20:37.351
TOGETHER.

05:20:37.418 --> 05:20:39.553
AND AND THEN MAKE A DECISION

05:20:39.620 --> 05:20:41.488
MAYBE -- THAT SOMETHING MIGHT

05:20:41.555 --> 05:20:43.857
HAPPEN -- BUT WE NEED AN ONGOING

05:20:43.924 --> 05:20:45.726
DISCUSSION WE HAVE A HUGE SYSTEM.

05:20:45.793 --> 05:20:58.606
ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE

05:20:58.672 --> 05:21:00.074
ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE THAT REALLY

05:21:00.140 --> 05:21:00.975
NEEDS THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT

05:21:01.041 --> 05:21:02.209
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FROM A

05:21:02.276 --> 05:21:02.843
CITIZEN COMMISSION THAT WOULD

05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:04.745
REALLY BE LOOKING AT THE TRANS.

05:21:04.812 --> 05:21:05.379
I JUST NEED TO TO TO MAKE SURE

05:21:05.446 --> 05:21:07.047
TO CORRECT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE --

05:21:07.114 --> 05:21:08.649
BUT CAL STATE WE HAVE A CAMPUS

05:21:08.716 --> 05:21:09.817
OF COUSE EXAMINED YOU KNOW IN

05:21:09.883 --> 05:21:10.985
PALM DESERT THERE ARE FOUR OR

05:21:11.051 --> 05:21:11.585
FIVE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS THAT

05:21:11.652 --> 05:21:11.885
ARE THERE.

05:21:11.952 --> 05:21:12.453
IN TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF A

05:21:12.519 --> 05:21:13.087
RESOURCES THAT THE COMMUNITIES

05:21:13.153 --> 05:21:14.588
JUST WANTS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE TO

05:21:14.655 --> 05:21:15.723
BE ABLE TO TO BEGIN TO TO THE

05:21:15.789 --> 05:21:16.757
BILL THAT OUT.

05:21:16.824 --> 05:21:18.025
THEY NEED A PLAN -- AND IT ALSO

05:21:18.092 --> 05:21:18.626
NEED TO BE PART OF THE OVERALL

05:21:18.692 --> 05:21:19.560
SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S

05:21:19.627 --> 05:21:21.228
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO TO DO

05:21:21.295 --> 05:21:23.030
THIS WORK AND AGAIN IT'S NOT

05:21:23.097 --> 05:21:23.931
FAIR TO SAY YEAH I JUST NEED TO

TO DO NEEDS BECAUSE STATEWIDE --

05:21:30.104 --> 05:21:33.340
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THESE SITES

05:21:33.407 --> 05:21:34.208
ARE SO IMPORTANT [inaudible]

05:21:34.274 --> 05:21:35.876
IRAQ.

05:21:35.943 --> 05:21:37.244

BELIAU.

05:27:13.880 --> 05:27:15.682
GREAT SO AS NOTED THAT THE ISSUE

05:27:15.749 --> 05:27:17.084
BEFORE YOU INVOLVES ENROLLMENT.

05:27:17.150 --> 05:27:18.418

KEY ISSUES FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

THE FIRST ISSUE HERE REPORT

05:27:26.393 --> 05:27:27.494
PERTAINS TO UNDERGRADUATE

05:27:27.561 --> 05:27:30.430
ENROLLMENT AT CSU AND YOU SEE.

05:27:30.497 --> 05:27:33.367
FOR CSU THE SENATE PROVIDED MORE

05:27:33.433 --> 05:27:34.768
THAN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FOR

05:27:34.835 --> 05:27:36.036
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE ASSEMBLY

05:27:36.103 --> 05:27:37.771
ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

05:27:37.838 --> 05:27:39.773
LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH. FOR

05:27:39.840 --> 05:27:40.707
YOU SEE.

05:27:40.774 --> 05:27:42.509
THEY BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED MORE

05:27:42.576 --> 05:27:43.643
MOMENT GROSS THAN WHAT THE

05:27:43.710 --> 05:27:45.112
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WITH THE

05:27:45.178 --> 05:27:46.480
ASSEMBLY PROVIDING MORE THAN THE

05:27:46.546 --> 05:27:48.782
SENATE.

05:27:48.849 --> 05:27:50.217
WITH REGARD TO UNDERGRADUATE

05:27:50.283 --> 05:27:51.585
ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE ARE GOING

05:27:51.651 --> 05:27:53.020
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMENTS

05:27:53.086 --> 05:27:54.154
THAT WE'VE MADE THROUGHOUT THE

05:27:54.221 --> 05:27:56.590
THE BUDGET PROCESS AS YOU THINK

05:27:56.656 --> 05:27:58.058
ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

05:27:58.125 --> 05:28:00.160
ON THE ONE HAND -- IF YOU LOOK

05:28:00.227 --> 05:28:01.595
AT TWO FIFTY FACTORS OF THE

05:28:01.661 --> 05:28:02.796
LEGISLATURE HISTORICALLY HAS

05:28:02.863 --> 05:28:03.997
LOOKED AT TO DETERMINE

05:28:04.064 --> 05:28:05.899
ENROLLMENT LEVELS -- HIGH SCHOOL

05:28:05.966 --> 05:28:07.367
GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO

05:28:07.434 --> 05:28:09.469
DECLINE VERY SLIGHTLY ON THE

05:28:09.536 --> 05:28:10.837
UPCOMING YEAR.

05:28:10.904 --> 05:28:12.973
AND BOTH -- SYSTEMS ARE DRAWING

05:28:13.040 --> 05:28:14.374
FROM BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL

05:28:14.441 --> 05:28:15.642
FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY POOLS.

05:28:15.709 --> 05:28:16.877
THOSE TWO FACTORS MIGHT SUGGEST

05:28:16.943 --> 05:28:18.678
THAT YOU COULD GO WITH THE LOWER

05:28:18.745 --> 05:28:20.514
AMOUNTS BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.

05:28:20.580 --> 05:28:22.549
ON THE OTHER HAND BOB STUDENTS

05:28:22.616 --> 05:28:25.185
AT BOTH SEGMENTS -- ARE MADE

05:28:25.252 --> 05:28:26.586
MANY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE NOT.

05:28:26.653 --> 05:28:28.055
ACCOMMODATED TO THEIR CAMPUS A

05:28:28.121 --> 05:28:29.489
CHOICE AND IN A CASE OF YOU SEE

05:28:29.556 --> 05:28:31.858
ARE REDIRECTED TO CAMPUS IS LIKE

05:28:31.925 --> 05:28:32.659
YOU SEE MERCED END UP NOT A

05:28:32.726 --> 05:28:34.061
ROLLING BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE

05:28:34.127 --> 05:28:35.796
CAMPUS THAT THEY PREFER TO GO.

05:28:35.862 --> 05:28:36.696
TO PROVIDING MORE ENROLLMENT

05:28:36.763 --> 05:28:38.465
GROWTH COULD ACCOMMODATE SOME OF

05:28:38.532 --> 05:28:39.433
THOSE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS AND IF

05:28:39.499 --> 05:28:40.667
THE FOR THAT WERE HIGH PRIORITY

05:28:40.734 --> 05:28:41.268
YOU COULD GO WITH THE HIGHER

05:28:41.334 --> 05:28:42.803
AMOUNTS SO IT'S GOING TO FALL

05:28:42.869 --> 05:28:44.538
DOWN TO WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE FOR

05:28:44.604 --> 05:28:45.806
A MOMENT AT THE TWO SYSTEMS.

05:28:45.872 --> 05:28:49.609
AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF

05:28:49.676 --> 05:28:51.812
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT.

05:28:51.878 --> 05:28:53.313
REGARDING GRADUATE ENROLLMENT OF

05:28:53.380 --> 05:28:54.281
THIS CITY THE SECOND ISSUE IS

05:28:54.347 --> 05:28:54.848
FOR GRADUATE ROLE MEANT THE

05:28:54.915 --> 05:28:55.482
SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T

05:28:55.549 --> 05:28:56.616
PROVIDE FUNDING EXPLICITLY FOR

05:28:56.683 --> 05:28:57.984
GRADUATE ROMAN GROSS THE

05:28:58.051 --> 05:28:59.986
ASSEMBLY DID.

05:29:00.053 --> 05:29:01.254
AND HERE WE WILL KNOW THAT THE

05:29:01.321 --> 05:29:03.123
STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND

05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:04.758
OF LONG STANDING UP POLICY

05:29:04.825 --> 05:29:05.992
GUIDELINES DRIVING GRADUATE

05:29:06.059 --> 05:29:07.594
MOMENT THAT IT DOES

05:29:07.661 --> 05:29:09.196
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT.

05:29:09.262 --> 05:29:11.231
ON THE UNIVERSITY HAS.

05:29:11.298 --> 05:29:12.966
LONG ARGUED THAT IT I WOULD LIKE

05:29:13.033 --> 05:29:14.401
TO GROW GRADUATE MOMENT IN

05:29:14.468 --> 05:29:15.669
CONCERT WITH UNDERGRADUATE REAL

05:29:15.735 --> 05:29:17.137
MEN AND THE OBJECTIVE THERE IS

05:29:17.204 --> 05:29:18.638
TO IT ADD MORE DISCUSSION

05:29:18.705 --> 05:29:20.140
SESSIONS AND AND ADD MORE T.

05:29:20.207 --> 05:29:21.241
A.'S.

05:29:21.308 --> 05:29:23.643
AYE TO ACCOMMODATE THE SORT OF

05:29:23.710 --> 05:29:24.177
HIGHER LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT

05:29:24.244 --> 05:29:25.278
GROWTH.

05:29:25.345 --> 05:29:26.313
I'M THE ROUGH RULE OF THUMB THE

05:29:26.379 --> 05:29:27.781
UNIVERSITY RULES ABOUT FOR

05:29:27.848 --> 05:29:28.815
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FOR EVERY

05:29:28.882 --> 05:29:30.217
GRADUATE STUDENT SO IF YOU

05:29:30.283 --> 05:29:31.418
WANTED TO KEEP THE PROPORTION

05:29:31.485 --> 05:29:33.086
ROUGHLY THE SAME AS IT IS IN IN

05:29:33.153 --> 05:29:34.588
THE CURRENT YEAR.

05:29:34.654 --> 05:29:35.188
ARE YOU COULD USE THAT ROUGH

05:29:35.255 --> 05:29:36.656
RULE OF THUMB SO FOR EXAMPLE

05:29:36.723 --> 05:29:38.558
UNDER THE SENATE PROPOSAL OF

05:29:38.625 --> 05:29:39.459
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

05:29:39.526 --> 05:29:41.428
THAT WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

05:29:41.495 --> 05:29:42.462
GRADUATE STUDENTS.

05:29:42.529 --> 05:29:47.067
AND OTHERS UNDER THE I'M SORRY

05:29:47.134 --> 05:29:47.934
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY UNDER TWO

05:29:48.001 --> 05:29:48.502
HUNDRED AND FIFTY UNDER THE

05:29:48.568 --> 05:29:50.370
SENATE PACKAGE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

05:29:50.437 --> 05:29:50.971
TWENTY FIVE GRADUATE STUDENTS

05:29:51.037 --> 05:29:52.239
UNDER THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE

05:29:52.305 --> 05:29:54.141
EXCUSE ME THERE.

05:29:54.207 --> 05:29:55.542
AND FINALLY THE THIRD ISSUE FOR

05:29:55.609 --> 05:29:57.144
YOU TO CONSIDER IS THE PER

05:29:57.210 --> 05:29:58.979
STUDENT FUNDING RATE -- THAT YOU

05:29:59.045 --> 05:30:00.413
SEE BETWEEN THE HOUSES THE HOUSE

05:30:00.480 --> 05:30:01.681
IS DIFFERENT HERE WITH THE

05:30:01.748 --> 05:30:03.583
SENATE PROVIDING A LOWER RATE

05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:04.317
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT

05:30:04.384 --> 05:30:05.385
IN THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDING A

05:30:05.452 --> 05:30:08.155
HIGHER RATE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE

05:30:08.221 --> 05:30:08.755
HUNDRED AND TWELVE DOLLARS PER

05:30:08.822 --> 05:30:09.022
STUDENT.

05:30:09.089 --> 05:30:09.990
AFFECTED LEE THE FUNDAMENTAL

05:30:10.056 --> 05:30:11.725
DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT THE

05:30:11.791 --> 05:30:13.026
SENATE OF FOCUSES ON

05:30:13.093 --> 05:30:14.261
UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT THE

05:30:14.327 --> 05:30:15.695
ASSEMBLY PROVIDES GROWTH FOR

05:30:15.762 --> 05:30:17.130
BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE

05:30:17.197 --> 05:30:18.965
ENROLLMENT UNDERGRADUATE MOMENT

05:30:19.032 --> 05:30:19.733
LIKELY.

05:30:19.799 --> 05:30:21.067
IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN GRADUATE

05:30:21.134 --> 05:30:23.436
ENROLLMENT AND SO THAT IS THAT

05:30:23.503 --> 05:30:24.538
THE FACTOR BEHIND THE TWO

05:30:24.604 --> 05:30:25.772
DIFFERENT RATES THERE WE THINK

05:30:25.839 --> 05:30:26.940
IT'S REASONABLE THAT IF YOU JUST

05:30:27.007 --> 05:30:28.542
FOCUS ON UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS

05:30:28.608 --> 05:30:29.576
YOU COULD GO WITH A A SENATE

05:30:29.643 --> 05:30:30.210
RATE.

05:30:30.277 --> 05:30:31.511
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE GROWTH

05:30:31.578 --> 05:30:32.412
FOR BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND

05:30:32.479 --> 05:30:34.514
GRADUATE ROLE THAT YOU COULD GO

05:30:34.581 --> 05:30:34.981
WITH THE ASSEMBLY RATE

05:30:35.048 --> 05:30:35.282
[inaudible]

05:30:35.348 --> 05:30:38.552
THANK YOU.

05:30:38.618 --> 05:30:40.387
THANK YOU ARE FINANCE. TO

05:30:40.453 --> 05:30:41.988
CERTAINLY ON NEITHER OF THESE
