APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE AND I I'M REALLY PLEASED TO WELCOME EVERYBODY TO THE FIRST SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE HEARING OF TWO THOUSAND. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR HEARING FROM OUR SPEAKERS HERE TODAY IN MY GOOD COLLEAGUE CENTER WILK IS NOW HERE. HOW WE WANT TO THANK OUR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS FOR COMING FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO SHARE YOUR EXPERTISE ACTUALLY HAS SOME FOLKS COMING FROM OUT OF STATE. AS WELL SO AND- WERE WE'RE GOING TO BE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY FULL HEARING TODAY SOME ACUMEN. BRIEF BUT- WE BUT THIS IS OF AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IT DEALS WITH CHALLENGES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- DEALING WITH THE NEW NORMAL IN OUR STATE WE OBVIOUSLY- HAVE. HAVE AS AS THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES SAYS IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL GO ASK A FIREFIGHTER- THE YEAH WE HAVE SEEN DESTRUCTIVE REPERCUSSIONS INTENSIFIED BY THE CLIMATE. CRISIS AND THE COMPLETE DEVASTATION OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT I WAS ABLE TO. YOU KNOW I GOOD SPIRITS TO MYSELF IN MY OWN DISTRICT THIS LAST YEAR AND WALKED AND WALKED THE BURN AREA AND I AND IN THE IN THE GETTY FIRE. AND IT WAS REALLY- INTENSE AND DISTRESSING AND YET I WAS ALSO IMPRESSED BY THE- REALLY HARD WORK OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS YOU COORDINATED FROM ALL OVER THE STATE IN SOME CASES THE GROUNDS AROUND THE NATION. TO ADDRESS THE FIRE IS THERE. ARE YOU KNOW NOT COURSE ARE A LOT OF OTHER CHALLENGES ASSOCIATE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THAT- WE STARTED TO SEE- WE'VE WE'VE ALSO JUST GOT NATURAL DISASTERS. IT ON THE NATURAL HEARING CALIFORNIA THE REST EARTHQUAKES BUT WE SEEMED. TSUNAMI HURRICANES FLOODING. AND MORE. AND SO THE WHOLE FIGHT HERE IS WHAT CAN WE LEARN ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY AND DRONES TO HELP WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR TESTIMONY FROM THE ASSOCIATION FOR UNMANNED VEHICLE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL WHICH IS DEDICATED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF UNMANNED SYSTEMS AND ROBOTICS EIGHTEEN TEASE GONNA. TALK TO US ABOUT THE USE OF DRONES IN RESTORING COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES NATURAL DISASTER AREAS. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HEAR FROM LOCAL STATE AGENCIES AND FOLKS FROM FIRE. AND OTHERS WHO WILL TESTIFY ON THE DRUM PROGRAMMING PROCEDURES THAT ARE USED IN WHILE FIRE FIGHTING AND OTHER EMERGENCIES SO. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND- AND THINK ABOUT AND LOOK AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE USING DRONES IMMERSE IMAGINE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED. AND ULTIMATELY PART OF THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN SOME THINGS THAT WILL HELP US AS WE THINKING ABOUT AS WE THINK ABOUT POLICY. EITHER ON C. PRIVACY ISSUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED ABOUT DRONES IS ISSUES SERVICES. WITH FOR OAKS VIGILANTE SO DECIDE TO. YOU KNOW TO OUT DRONES OR YOU THEIR OWN PRIVATE BECAUSE THEY WERE. FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT SOMETIMES GET THE WAY OF A RUMOR SEEM WE'RE GONNA LEARN A THAT TO SO WITH THAT I'D LOVE TO ALLOW OKAY IF MY OTHER CALL WANTS TO MAKE ANY WERE BUT I TO WE SHOULD ALWAYS OPEN HEARING. AND WE'LL START SO LET'S START WITH ARE. ARE YOU CAN START ART IS AT THE- STUDENTS ARE PREGGO ARE. FROM TO THE EIGHTEEN T. FOR DRUM PROGRAM TO. AND TIME AGAIN AROUND TIME GO. OUR SENIOR BY PRESIDENT FOR ADVERTISING. REALLY AT A YOU V. S. I. AND I DO ALSO TO JUST GIVE US A SHOUT. YOU A- WILL BROKE HIS WAY TO CRAP HARD SHE'S ARE. FOR THIS CAN. WORKS OUT OF LOS BUT IS REALLY WERE HARD TO PULL TOGETHER WHAT THINK AND I KNOW WILL BE A REALLY. HEARING WE WANT TO YOU FOR A HARDWARE. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO TOM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN AND SENT. WILL CONSIDER JONES THANK YOU FOR REAPED. STAYS HE- MY NAME IS TOM. I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND HAVE. AT A U. V. ASIDE. IF YOU MENTIONED A UV SIZE USES. FOR I'M VEHICLES. IN A- THE WORLD THE WORLD'S. NOT OR- DEVOTED. TO ADVANCING ON SYSTEM AND- AVS BIT OF AN- TO IN THE AIR. GROUND AND MAY. DO FOR FIVE YEARS AND AT A- ON MANTA. SYSTEMS ALL KNOWN AS YOU A. S. AND DRAW. A UPS AS MORE THIRTY LOCAL. ARE THE WORLD INCLUDING THREE HERE AND- THE CHANNEL ISLANDS SAN DIEGO LINDBERGH AND SILICON VALLEY CHAPTERS PROVIDE NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. INVOLVEMENT IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS STEM EDUCATION AND MUCH MORE. A U. V. AS I MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LEADING THE WAY TO DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO ADVANCE UNMANNED SYSTEMS. HAS COMPANIES ACROSS THE STATE INCREASINGLY UC'S PLATFORMS FOR THEIR WORK. IN ADDITION TO THEIR MANY BENEFITS FOR COMMERCIAL USE IN INDUSTRIES RANGING FROM REAL ESTATE. PLEASE INSPECTION TO AGRICULTURE. UNMANNED SYSTEMS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE GREATER GOOD. SUPPORTING MISSIONS FROM CHESTER RELIEF TO HUMANITARIAN AID TO CONSERVATION. CALIFORNIA IS NO EXCEPTION. IT PLAN FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. OTHER AGENCIES ARE ALL USING. OF CRIME AND HAND PUBLIC SAY. URGING AND RAPIDLY BALL TECH WILL BE DESCRIBED MY FELLOW A TODAY'S HE ARE HELPING TO SAVE LIVES AND- BY ALLOWING FOR RESPOND TO THEIR MORE IF. EFFECTIVELY THE MOST IMPORTANT SAFELY. HOWEVER WE REGULATION TO THE FED AND STATE LEVEL ARE IMPORTANT FOR FOSTERING THE SAFE ADOPTION OF UNMANNED SYSTEMS WHEN GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT SACRIFICING INNOVATION OR SAFETY BOTH PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS CAN FLOURISH. MOST RECENT REPERTORY DEVELOPMENT WAS IN DECEMBER WHEN THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION RELEASED ITS NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON ABOUT IT HAITIAN YOU A S. REMOTE UBER LAW ENFORCEMENT WE INSTANT TRACK KEEP THE TO JUST ALL. YOU A. S. FROM THOSE IT MAY PAY A THREAT. WHAT ID WILL ALSO BECAUSE OF A U. S. TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SO OR YOU T. M. WHICH IS PRIMARILY BEING DEVELOPED BY NASA THE F. RIGHT IN CAL. OVER MY OFFICE. IT WORKS ALONGSIDE EXISTING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR UNMANNED AIRCRAFT ETIAM ALSO REDUCE BARRIERS TO INNOVATION AND IMPROVE SAFETY AND SECURITY FOR ALL AIRCRAFT OUR SKIES BOTH MANNED. AND UNMANNED THE FAA IS CURRENTLY SOLICITING PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED REMOTE ID RULE AND A FINAL RULE IS ANTICIPATED AFTER THE AGENCIES REVIEW. REMOTE IDEAS ALSO NEEDED TO PERMIT EXPANDED OPERATIONS SUCH AS BEYOND VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT AND FLIGHTS OVER PEOPLE. WHICH CAN BENEFIT PUBLIC SAFETY OF WIDESPREAD EVENTS ARE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS LIKE WILD FIRES. THESE EXPANDED OPERATIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS ARE NECESSARY TO IMPROVE PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WELL THE FAA HAS SOLE AUTHORITY OVER THE AIR SPACE THERE ARE IMPORTANT ROLES FOR STATE GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING DRONE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO APPLYING TO EXISTING STATE LAWS- FOR PRIVACY WITH YOU A. S. SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SENATE. DID WITH LEGISLATION PASSED DURING THE LAST SESSION CONGRESS HAS ESTABLISH A POLICY FOR STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE FAA TO KEEP HIS GUYS IN YOUR COMMUNITY SAFE. SECTION TWO TWO FOUR NINE OF THE FAA EXTENSION SAFETY IN SECURITY OF TWENTY SIX. DIRECTED THE F. TO US A PROCESS FOR LOW AND TRY GOVERNMENTS TO PETITION THE FAA TO RESTRICT YOU A. S. OPERATIONS A CLOSED. IS TO FIX IT'S LIKE. SUCH AS CRITICAL. WELL THE F. PLANS TO IN A- PROPOSAL SOON REGARDING OPERATIONS- OVER THESE FACILITIES WITH INPUT FROM ST CITIES COUNTIES AND TRY. THE SECTION TO OH NINE PER WILL. THE FAA'S AUTHORITY THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE. AND PROVIDE A UNIFORM REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR U. S. OPERATORS TO FOLLOW. THE FAA IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONDUCTING A U. S. INTEGRATION PILOT PROGRAM TO HELP ACCELERATE SAFE DRONE INTEGRATION INTO THE AIRSPACE AND ALLOW STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL SHELLS TO RECOMMEND PER THE RIGHT PATIENTS. NINE KEEP PEACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN. SAN DIEGO ARE YOU IN CRITICAL RESEARCH CHEATING. MINE IN MAKING ROOM IDEA AND YOU TO MARIA. WHILE ALSO FEEDBACK TO THE A. A. R. FUTURE MAKING ENABLE A- SUCH AS PAC DELIVERY. ANY PERSONAL TRANCE. ALSO KNOWN AS URBAN AIR MOBILE. WELL THEN OPERATIONS AS THESE ARE VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF DRONE INTO. WE MUST ALSO IN THAT THE COLLECTED TO READ. TRANSMITTED AND SHARE. AFTER FLIGHT OPERATIONS IS SECURE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION CONVENE REPRESENTATIVES FROM GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY. AND CIVIL LIBERTY GROUPS TO DEVELOP A SET OF BEST PRACTICES FOR U. S. PRIVACY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. TO ENSURE THAT U. S. OPERATORS ARE FLYING RESPONSIBLY. A YOU THE S. I PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS AND THE RESULTING BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE CLEAR CHITONS FOR OPERATORS FOR BEST TO COLLECT OR HOW TO BEST COLLECTED AND STORED SECURE DATA. FINALLY WE CANNOT IGNORE THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN DETERRING CARELESS CLUELESS AND CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. LEGIONS OF NEW U. S. OPERATORS MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE FAA REGULATIONS THAT DETERMINE WHERE THEY CAN AND CANNOT FLY. A U. V. S. I THE ACADEMY. AND EXIT THE FAA PART TO LAUNCH THE KNOW BEFORE YOU FLY PER. TO FOUR TO PROVIDE THESE NEW. WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OPERATING. INCOME OF APPLE AND GUIDELINES. THE CALIFORNIA SENATE RECORD A NOBLE YOU FLY CAMPAIGN ARREST. HERE OFFICIAL SOURCES SAY AND YOU. FOR AN ACTIVE OP. OF UNMANNED AIR SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA LEE THE NATION THE NUMBER OF DRONE OP. AND CRITICAL FOR THESE BE. IN KNOW THE RULE. BY ENCOURAGING AND CHECK WITH THE- YOU. THE CALIFORNIA IS HELP TO ROADS SAFETY OF AIRSPACE. MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO IF IN THE OF ON SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE- AND INDUSTRY HAVE BANDED TO ADVANCE THE OPERATIONS THIS BILL. FOR USE BY PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. BY CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER WE CAN DEVELOP HOLISTIC POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT GIVE US THE FRAMEWORK TO KEEP THE SKIES SAFE AND SECURE. WHILE ALLOWING THE U. S. INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA TO TRULY TAKE OFF. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY TO LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE. I'M GONNA BE ON A WELCOME AND SAID GALGIANI SEE. I ART MOVE NOW GONNA PRESENT FROM EIGHTEEN TO. YES THANK YOU SO I'D LIKE TO IN YOU TO WHAT WE CALL OUR FOR CAN. CAO STAN FOR SO ON WE- THIS IS A- SALUTE THAT WE HAVE FOR PROVIDE CONNECT. TO FIRST RESPONDER UP SAFETY. AND TO THE CHEN PUBLIC AFTER DISASTER THIS IS BASICALLY A DRONE- THAT THAT HAS CELL TOWER EQUIPMENT ON IT SO IT'S OFFLINE CELL TOWER. A FEW KEY TAKE TAKE AWAYS FROM THE SOLUTION- IT'S VERY RESILIENT A FLEXIBLE ADAPTABLE QUICK TO DEPLOY- WE CAN FLY IT. AT ALTITUDES AT FOUR HUNDRED FEET AND WE CAN FLY FOR IT THAT WITH A VERY SOLUTIONS FROM DAYS TO WEEKS TO MONTHS AT A TIME WITHOUT LANDING- AT FOUR HUNDRED FEET WE CAN PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY. TO UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SQUARE MILES- SO THAT'S A VERY LARGE COVERAGE AREA THAT WE CAN COVER WITH A SINGLE ROUND UP. TO SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIMULTANEOUS CONNECTED USERS. HER PER DRONES SO IT'S FLEX VERY DOWN. CAN SAYS A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME OVER A WIDE COVERAGE AREA WE FLY THESE DRONES THROUGH A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR FIRST NET PROGRAM AND THROUGH OUR NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAM FIRST THAT. THAT'S A NETWORK THAT SAID- BUILT DESIGNED BUILT- A DEDICATED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES FOR FIRST RESPONDERS- THERE'S OVER TEN THOUSAND OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THAT ARE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THAT THIS PROGRAM. OVER A MILLION ACTIVE CONNECTIONS. ON ON THIS NETWORK THAT'S DEDICATED TO FIRST RESPONDERS- EIGHTEEN T. IS PUT IN OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT INTO THIS NETWORK. AND THE IMPORTANT THING HERE FOR DRONES IS THERE SEVENTY SIX DEDICATED DEPLOYABLE FOR THE MOST PART THESE ARE VEHICLES LIKE THE ONE ON THE SLIDE. THAT WE CAN RAPIDLY DEPLOYED TO RESTORE COMMUNICATIONS- OR PROVIDE COMMUNICATIONS TO FIRST RESPONDERS BUT WE ALSO HAVE DRONES- FLYING HOUSE THAT I JUST MENTIONED. AS PART OF THESE DEPLOYABLE SO- IN OUR NETWORK DISASTER RECOVERY PROGRAM THIS IS WHERE WE- PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC'S AFTER A THAT MAJOR DISASTER WE QUICKLY RESTORE THE NETWORK WE THIS IS A TEMPORARY. NETWORK THAT WE PUT UP THERE THIS IS REPRESENTS OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN EIGHTEEN T. TO. COOPER AFTER AFTER DISASTERS AGAIN WE HAVE DRAWN AS PART OF THIS PRO AS WELL. THIS ESSENTIALLY HOW ARE STILL WORK WITH A DRONE UP IN THE AIR YES SIR. OF. OKAY WE WERE DRAWN UP ON THEIR ON A TETHER IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AND THEN THAT WE PROVIDE POWER THAT WE CAN USE EITHER JOE WITH HERE POWER WE CAN USE SOLAR. AND A THE ENTIRE SO THROUGH PANEL THE SIGNAL YOUR HAND TO THE DOWN TO THE BASE BAND UNIT THEN GO INTO WHATEVER OF BACK CALL WE WOULD WE DEFAULT TO SETTLE OF NOTHING ELSE IS OF A BUT WE HAVE MULTI FORMS OF FACT WE CAN. YOU HAVE IS ON DISPLAY TODAY THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE HERE BUT WE WILL BE COMING BACK IN A IN A MONTH SO WE'LL HAVE IT WILL HAVE A DRAW HERE ON THE ON THIS SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT AT ONE OF THE THAT THIS. RIGHT HERE. I. THE FELT LAB. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- IN IN A DESERT AREA AND THE DRONE WAS WAS AT FOUR HUNDRED FEET AND WE GOT- JUST UNDER NINE MILES OF LATERAL COVERAGE ADEQUATE TO TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SQUARE MILES OF COVERAGE WITH STRONG SIGNAL STRENGTH AND THEN TO THE RIGHT YEAH THERE'S A COUPLE OF AND SETS- THAT. COVERAGE SHOWING IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA A TRADITIONAL CELL TOWER AT SIXTY FEET VERSES THAT THE GRAPHIC RIGHT BELOW IT A DRONE AT FOUR HUNDRED FEET YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN AND COVERAGE AREA SO TREMENDOUS CAPABILITIES FROM FROM THESE DRONES WE HAVE VARIOUS TYPES. OF DRONE SOLUTIONS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WE DEPLOY WHATEVER TYPE OF DROWNED IT TAKES FOR THE THAT PARTICULAR. DISASTER EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING WE HAVE- TRADITIONAL MULTI ROTOR DRONES WE HAVE HELICOPTERS THAT CAN CARRY ADDITIONAL WEIGHT WE HAVE AN ALL WEATHER DROWNED. THAT CAN FLY IN A TROPICAL STORM HER CYCLONE IT'S PHONE AND FIFTY SEVEN MILE AN HOUR WINDS- THIS PARTICULAR JOHN- WHAT WAS USED TO- RECORD IN THE GAME OF THRONES- MOVIE FOR HBO IF YOU SAW THE SCENES NORTH OF THE WALL- THIS THIS WAS TO DRAW. A LINE IN ICELAND FOR THAT- THERE'S ALSO WE HAVE A V. TOLL SOLUTION TAKES OFF VERTICALLY LIKE A HELICOPTER TRANSITIONS COLLATERAL FLIGHT. THAT WAY WE DON'T NEED A TETHER IF WHERE ARE OUR OVER FLY AND IT'S RESISTANT AND- YES SIR. THE SAID THAT THE DRAW WE CAN FLY SIXTEEN HOURS PROVIDING CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY AT THE END OF THE SIXTEEN HOURS WE LAUNCH A SECOND ROUND AND THEN JUST JUST KEEP ROTATING THEM WE HAVE AEROSTATS BLIMPS SIX OF FIFTY SIX FOOT BLIMP THAT WE CAN PUT IN THE AIR FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITHOUT LANDING WITH MACRO CELL TOWER EQUIPMENT ON SO THE SAME EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE ON OUR CELL TOWERS WE HAVE ON BLANKS- WITH THE END OF TWO WEEKS IN. TOWN TOPPED OFF WITH ADDITIONAL HELIUM PUT IT UP ANOTHER WEEKS WE CAN ALSO DIED TURN TRADITIONAL AIRPLANES INTO SELF LINE CELL TOWERS AS WELL BY PUTTING THE EQUIPMENT. ON THEIR- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE THAT TETHER ON THE GROUND- THE NUMBER THREE IS A SOLUTION I PREVIOUSLY SHOWED YOU. OF THAT- THAT THAT THAT SOLUTIONS VERY MOBILE WE CAN PUT IT ON THE BACK OF AN ATV- AND THAT THAT THE TOP LEFT IS A SOLAR PANELS VEHICLES SO WE CAN DRIVE THAT ON SITE. OPEN UP THE SOLAR PANELS AND THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH POWER FOR THE ENTIRE. TIRE SOLUTION- THE TOP RIGHT IS OUR FIRST NET. A SOLUTION SO THESE TRAILERS WE LAUNCHED THE DRONES FROM THE TRAILERS THEY ALSO HAVE THE SATELLITE. COMMUNICATIONS BUILT INTO THE TRAILERS AS WELL SO IT'S ALL SELF CONTAINED UNITS. THE BOTTOM LEFT IS AN ALL TERRAIN- TRAILER THAT THAT'S WHAT W DEPLOYED TO- TO PORTO RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA TO RESTORE SERVICES THERE. BACK CALL WE DEFAULT TO SATELLITE BUT THAT'S NOT OUR ONLY OPTION. WE CAN USE A MICROWAVE TO GET THE SIGNAL BACK INTO OUR NETWORK FREE SPACE OPTICAL- ETHERNET FIBRE IF THE IF THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE CASE OF- REPORTER RICO- WE DEPLOYED IN A- WALMART PARKING LOT. AND THERE WAS AN ACTIVE- FIBERLINK AND IN THAT WALMART A WAREHOUSE SO WE PULLED IT OUT INTO THE PARKING LOT AND USE THAT FOR BACK ALL INTERESTS SUPPORTED. HIM THOUSANDS OF USERS THROUGH THROUGH THAT THROUGH THAT CONNECTION. THIS SHOWS. THAT AN AREA THAT THAT'S A- WHERE IT IS A- HEAVILY DENIED AREAS SO THERE'S NO POWER NO- INFRASTRUCTURE WHATSOEVER AND YOU CAN SEE HOW WE CAN PUT UP A PRETTY ROUGH ROBUST NETWORK WITH THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SOLUTIONS. THIS IS AN OPERATIONAL SOLUTION WE HAVE DEPLOYED AT- OF- MANY TIMES SINCE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN- SO IT CAN SUPPORT- EARTHQUAKES LISTEN ARMIES- ANY TYPE OF. OF URBAN ENVIRONMENT- WHICH DAY AFTER ST PATRICK'S DAY PARADE WE PROVIDED AND CONNECTIVE ITTY THERE THERE'S A SEARCH AND RESCUE EXERCISE WE RECENTLY CONDUCTED. A IN THE SAN JOSE AREA AND THE IN THE MOUNTAINS- SO AND ALSO EVEN PGA OF EVENT THAT'S ALSO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WE SUPPORTED WITH THE SOLUTION WE CAN PUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADDITIONAL- ATTACHMENTS TO THESE DRONES WHILE THEY'RE PROVIDING CONNECTIVITY THAT CAN PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES AS WELL. IN DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE AN AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE WHERE WE CAN LAUNCH THE DRUMS FROM INTERVIEWS VEHICLES SO IF THERE'S A FLOODED AREA AREAS THAT ARE. HARD TO GET TO WE CAN WE CAN ACCESS SOMEWHAT WITH THIS VEHICLE WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON A SOLAR POWERED. UP PLATFORM THIS IS A THIRTY THREE FOOT WING SPAN IT CAN FLY- FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT A TIME WITHOUT LANDING FOR PROVIDING HACK CONNECTIVITY. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE ARE WE OPERATE AT SCALE YOU CAN SEE FOR THESE VARIOUS EVENTS A NUMBER OF DRONES THAT WE DEPLOYED THIS IS TO DO DAMAGE ASSESSMENT- SO IF SAY IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE IN A. LARGE URBAN AREA WE CAN DEPLOY HI. OF DRONES TO HELP RESTORE THE NETWORK WE'VE EVEN PULLED FIBER- WITH DRONES ACROSS RIVERS AND LAKES TO HELP RESTORE SERVICE. WE ALSO HAVE A MEDICAL A- MEDICINE DELIVERING SOLUTIONS EIGHTEEN T. PROPRIETARY A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN MONITOR THE TEMPERATURES OF THE OF THE MEDICINE IN ROUTE- WHETHER IT'S BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND THAT'S AVAILABLE AS WELL. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH. MIKE FLORIDA THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE SAID CAST CAN FLY RIGHT THIS IS. THOSE THOSE- IT'S A VERY VERY IT'S OBSERVE GOOD GOOD TO SEE THAT WORK. DO YOU FEEL WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU AND- TO TELL ME JUST GIVES A BETTER SENSE OF EXACTLY HOW THESE ARE USED WE WHICH WHICH THE FIRES WITH. WHAT WAS IT WE WHICH OF THE FIRES OF THE FLYING CAL USED IN CALIFORNIA RECENTLY WE USE TRADITIONAL SAT CALLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FIRES WE DID WE DIDN'T DEPLOY BUT THE DRONES WE THEY WERE AVAILABLE THERE ON STAND BY BUT- THERE WASN'T A NEED FOR THEM IN THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION AS TO WHICH SO IT'S USUALLY BASED ON COVERAGE SO A TRADITIONAL SAT CALLED HAS A TELESCOPING ANTENNA MAST- IT'LL GO TO SIXTY. FEET AND IF THAT PROVIDE OF COVERAGE HERE GO WITH THAT. WIDER COVERAGE FOR IN MORTGAGE. TERRAIN TO ACCESS THEN WE WOULD SEND AN- OF FLYING COW FOR EXAMPLE THE PGA EVENT I MENTIONED THERE'S TWO EIGHTEEN HOLE GOLF COURSES THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT. IT TOOK THREE TRADITIONAL. SAT CALLS TO COVER THAT AREA OVER THAT TERRAIN- BUT INSTEAD WE DEPLOYED A SINGLE DRONE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO AREAS WE'RE ABLE TO COVER THE ENTIRE AREA WITH WITH ONE DRAWN SO IT'S BUT IT'S BASED ON ON THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND ARE YOU DO YOU TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS AND CAL FIRE AND OTHERS WHEN YOU'RE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. IS THERE IS OUR COORDINATION OR IS IT- SO OUR FIRST MET. TEAM THERE'S A IT'S BY A INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES OF PUBLIC SAFETY SAYS I NEED CONNECTIVITY AT THIS LOCATION. THEN THE THAT TEAM WORKS INTERNALLY WITHIN EIGHTEEN T. TO DETERMINE HOW WE MEET THAT NEED- THEY THEY AGAIN THEY THEY GO TO SAT CULTS FIRST IF THAT'S NOT. A VIABLE OPTION AND THEN DOWN THE CONTACT- THE DRONE TEAM AND WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY RIVER BRIT RESPONSE THAT WE HAVE A- SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT WE HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS THAT WE NEED TO BE ON STATION PROVIDING CONNECTIVITY. SO THERE'S A PROCESS TO DETERMINE- FROM WHEN THE CALL COMES IN WHICH TYPE OF SOLUTION IS BEING DEPLOYED. HOW DOES THE COMPENSATION WORKERS USE OF A KIND OF CONTRACT. YES SO FIRST MET. THROUGH THE FIRST NET AUTHORITY THAT THAT'S A DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE SO IT'S A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM THESE-DEPLOYABLE SEARCH NO COST TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ARE COVERS. CORRECT OKAY. SO THE IT'S A TWENTY FIVE YEAR CONTRACT SO AS AGENCIES SIGN UP FOR THAT THAT'S A SERVICE. THEN OUR BOB. IS ENSURE THAT THAT SERVICES ALWAYS ALWAYS AVAILABLE SO WE- FORMULA BY WHICH THEY PAY. THERE'S I BUILT A GUY I'M NOT UNFORTUNATE TEAMS WHAT I BELIEVE THAT THEY THEY- PAY A CERTAIN A SUBSCRIPTION FOR SO MANY ACCOUNTS SERVED OF DEVICES- IS SO. I OKAY. JUST OKAY QUESTIONS EMERGENCY CENTER BOOK. ARE YOU FROM WITH WHAT P. S. P. S. IS ANOTHER OKAY I WALK YOU THROUGH IT SO WE HAVE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THIS STATE AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS THING CALLED P. S. P. S. WHICH IS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. I CAUGHT B. S. P. S. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY NEED TO DO IT. AND I KNOW- IN IN ADDISON WHICH IS MY REGION ONLY TO ONLY 2% OF THEIR TERRITORY WAS SHUT DOWN BUT IT WAS MY DISTRICT. AND PEOPLE LOST HOMES SO IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA IN YOUR PARA GETS SHUT OFF. NO POWER NO WATER COULD YOU COULD YOU POP AND NO NO CELL COVERAGE SO ARE THESE COWS ARE JUST SOMETHING THAT COULD BE- IT. DEPLOYED IN AREAS IF WE'RE IF WE'RE EXPERIENCING A P. S. P. S. SITUATION. IF THERE'S NO CONNECTIVITY AND THEN IT IT CAN BE TO DEPLOY TO RESTORE THAT CONNECTED YOU HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH ANY OF THE I. O. USE- REGARDING. DOING THIS I HAVE NOT I I'M I'M ON THAT THE DRONE SIDE SO WHAT HAPPENS IS I GET CALLS IN. SANTA PLAN THAT MEETS OTHERS EXTERNALLY FACING ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD WOULD MEET WITH AND OUR- INTERFACE WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THAT'S VIABLE THAT WOULD THEM IF IT. CORRECT IS DEFINITELY VIABLE GUESSER OKAY. VERY GOOD CAN I ASK QUESTIONS OF THE GERMAN. HOW DO WE BALANCE. NOT STIFLING INNOVATION BUT ALSO PROTECTING YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S YOU KNOW PRIVACY YOU WANT IT I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF OPEN ENDED AT LEADING GO WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO WE WILL BE A WHAT'S THE PROPER BALANCE ON THAT AND THEN TO ARE WE BETTER OFF. ADOPTING A FEDERAL- PLATFORM SO IT'S NOT PATCHWORK OR I JUST YOUR YOUR GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THAT RIGHT PUBLIC CENTER- WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY IS AN ISSUE THAT THE INDUSTRY TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE WE WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS WANT TO ENSURE THEIR INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY'S. BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE INDUSTRY AND THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION AGENCY WHICH IS PART OF THE PART OF COMMERCE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND ALSO CIVIL LIBERTY GROUPS GOT TOGETHER WITH A BEST PRACTICES FOR YOU A. S. PRIVACY AND I PUT THAT INFORMATION YOUR PACKAGE TODAY. AS WE FOR ALL OF US TO GET TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT. GIVE ME WHAT PROCEDURE SHOULD WE TAKE IN ORDER TO ENSURE INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY WHEN. WHEN OUR WHAT OUR MEMBERS THERE'S ARE OPERATING THE DRONES AND SO- THERE'S GUIDELINES IN THERE ABOUT. HOW TO- WHEN YOU'RE GATHERING THE DATA HOW YOU GO ABOUT GATHERING DATA BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PROTECTION THAT DATA AND SECURING THAT DATA AND KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT DATA AND WHEN YOU'RE NOT. USING THAT DATA ANY LONGER TO DISPOSE OF THAT DATA- BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER USUALLY YOU ARE TO YOUR OPERATIONS OF THE AIRCRAFT- BUT- WE DO AND I KNOW OF MANY THE AGENCIES REPRESENTED HERE TODAY AND MANY OF. COMPANIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OPERATIONS STRONG DELIVER. ARE DOING SIR THE NEIGHBORLY THING BY GOING OUT AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT ONCE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE BENEFITS GOING TO PROVIDE. IS MORE STEP THE- WAY JUST AT ENDING AT FOUR. OPERATING WHAT THE SERVICES WILL BE PER THE AND- PEOPLE. THEY CAN OF YOUR- THE- DATA. GAP OF WHAT. THIS IS TO GATHER. GOING TO USE THAT. IT COMES TO TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THE POLITICIAN FOR ALL UNDER TREAT OUR PERSPECTIVE TO DO THAT A FEDERAL LEVEL THE AIRSPACE TO DO OF THE FAA AND THEY DETERMINE WHERE ERIC WHETHER IT'S MANDER MANTA THEY CAN FOR AND THEIR THE MESSAGE TO THOUGH THINGS QUIRK VERY CLOSE WITH THE F. ON SOME REAL MAKING GOING ON RIGHT NOW KALRA I. AND AT NAY TO HAVE A RADIO NON PORTED DRONE SO LAUNCH OR OTHER AUTHORITIES WHO NEED TO KNOW WHO'S OPERATING THAT DRONE WERE THEY OPERATING IT WILL GET THAT INFORMATION AND AGAIN IT'S ON A MOVE FOR SECURITY BUT DOWN THE LINE IT WILL BE USED FOR THIS- UNMANNED SYSTEMS TRAFFIC MANAGER PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED TO HELP WITH NAVIGATION FOR DRONES OVER LONG DISTANCES AND HELPING IN PLACES LIKE FOR EIGHTEEN T. IS OPERATING. SO THEY CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT THAT ARE IN THAT SITUATION AREA. FIVE YEARS FROM NOW HELP FORGET HOW PERVASIVE ARE ARE JONES GOING TO BE AND WHAT OTHER APPLICATIONS. THAT YOU FOR C. OCCURRING FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY HAPPENING. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE FAA'S OWN FORECAST RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE LICENSED TO COMMERCIALLY FLY DRONES WHETHER THEY WERE DOING IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES OR CIVIL PURPOSES LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PUBLIC SAFETY. THEY PROJECT THAT THERE WILL BE THREE TIMES A NUMBER OF PILOTS WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND LICENSE PILOTS BIRD FLY UNMANNED SYSTEMS. IN UNITED STATES. SO THERE'S A GREAT DEMAND FOR IT AS YOU SEE. COMPANIES LIKE EIGHTEEN T. ANOTHER UTILITIES ARE USING IT FOR INSPECTIONS. I THINK YOU GO TO SEE A REALLY- BIG GROWTH IN THAT AREA JUST BECAUSE- AGAIN THE EFFICIENCIES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DOING THOSE PUBLIC SAFETY OF THOSE PUBLIC UTILITY INSPECTIONS. AND ALSO THE SAFETY ASPECT OF IT AS WELL. BUT YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE COVERAGE WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A DRONE DOWN A WIDE. RIGHT OF WAY THEN YOU CAN DRIVING A BUCKET TRUCK DOWN THAT SAME RIGHT AWAY. THE TIME EFFICIENCIES THERE ALONE ARE A LOT GREATER. ALSO I THINK YOU TO SEE AN INCREASE IN PACKAGE DELIVERY- PACKAGE DELIVERY NOW IS JUST- PRE NASCENT INDUSTRY. IS JUST STARTING PLACES LIKE VIRGINIA NORTH CAROLINA. THAT WE HAVE ONE PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY HERE FROM CALIFORNIA TODAY U. S. O. G. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THE ONLY PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY IN. CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK WE'LL JUST SEE MORE OF THAT AS THE FAA COMES UP WITH REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE ON HOW TO OP. THAT SYSTEM. Q. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ABOVE OUR PALACE AGREE RESPECT ON FRIDAY SECTOR ENGAGEMENT THIS AREA WERE NEXT CAN HEAR FROM- COUPLE VOICES FROM TE LOCAL LEVEL WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH WITH- WITH YOUR PRODUCTS- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SENATOR SO OUR NEXT PANEL AND- INCLUDES CATHARINE GIFFORD IS FROM SACRAMENTO MUCH FUN FIRE DISTRICT AND THEN ALSO COMMANDER TIME MATT AGAIN. WHO'S WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND WE'LL START WITH YOU KATHY GIFFORD. THANK YOU. GET MY STUFF HERE OR WHEN YOU WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. AS CENTERS OF MONEY TRYING DIFFERENT I'M A CAPTAIN WITH SEGMENT MUCH FALLEN FIRE DISTRICT HERE IN SUFFOLK COUNTY I'M ALSO YOU AB PROGRAM MANAGER FOR OUR AGENCY WE STARTED A ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO BEEN ACTUALLY FLYING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS- UNDER TWO DIFFERENT FAA SHIFT ITS AUTHORIZATION AND PART ONE OF SEVEN AUTHORIZATION METROPARK COVERS ABOUT THREE FIFTY SQUARE MILES. THE GREATER PART OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY ON A FORTY STATIONS- COVER PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING FROM. LIGHT INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL URBAN RURAL AND ABOUT NINE MILES A SEGMENT OF RIVER- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEASURE FIRING ABOUT NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND CALLS FOR SERVICE FOR YOU THAT YOU GUYS ARE A COUNTY. TO WEAR SPECIAL DISTRICT BUT WE ARE EFFECTIVELY A COUNTY AGENCY WHERE WHERE SPECIAL FIRED ISSUE BECAUSE WE COVER MORE THAN- JUST SECOND COUNTY WE ALSO PUSHING THE PLASTER- SO LIKE TO ORDER HOW WOULD YOU. OKAY THIS. INCLUDES CITY SACRAMENTO AS WELL NO SEGMENT OF OUR DEPARTMENT IS ETERNITY- BUT IT DOES INCLUDE THE CITIES OF CITRUS HEIGHTS FAIR OAKS- AREAS IN CARMICHAEL ARDEN. BASED AND IN MOST OF THE- SO YOU DOWN THEY'LL- AND PUSH OUT CITY SOME HAS INVITED. AND THEN UP TO CITY ROSE. AND THAT WE DO HAVE AN AREA PLASTIC AS WELL THAT COVERAGE WHY THIS BY DISTRICT. TOM ARE YOU YOU PROGRAM. HAS ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PILOTS IN SOME LEVEL OF TRAINING FROM BRAND NEW ALL THE WAY UP TO YOU FULLY QUALIFIED AND- AND FLYING LIGHT MISSIONS. WE FIND OUT SIXTEEN AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY. A DIFFERENT- MODELS. AND WE ARE JUST UNDER A THOUSAND MISSIONS THAT WE'VE FLOWN IN THE PAST- THREE YEARS SINCE WE'VE BEEN FLYING ACTIVELY- COUPLE OTHER THINGS WERE INVOLVED WITH BESIDES MATTER FIRES. YEAR THE PROGRAM- WE ALSO COORDINATE THE SACRAMENTO- REGIONAL UAV OPERATORS GROUP WHICH IS. TWENTY EIGHT LONG FIRE AGENCIES IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA THAT IT BASICALLY FORMA SOCIAIS XIN TO TRADE BEST PRACTICES AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER TRAIN EACH OTHER WE JUST HAD A- AND DATE. THE SECOND. IS THE OTHER DAY. I'M WE'RE ALSO INVOLVED WITH FIRE SCOPE FOR. HIM FAMILIAR FIRES AS FAR SCOPE IS A- POTS AND PRACTICES GROUP THAT WAS FORMED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES- FROM SOME. BAD FATAL FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EFFECTIVELY A FIRE SCOPE IS GROUPING OF. AND FIRE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE GET TOGETHER IN DIFFERENT COMMITTEES TO FIVE TO FORM POLICY MISS PRACTICE THAT'S HOW WE GET ALL THAT INFORMATION PUT TOGETHER AND PUT OUT SO THAT. WHEN THERE'S A LARGE FIRE THAT'S HELD FIRE ENGINES FROM UP HERE GO TO THE SOUTH OR FROM THE SOUTH AND COMMITTEE HELICOPTERS. UNIT TYPING PERSONAL TYPING ALL THE OTHER PARTS AND PIECES TO GO ALONG WITH THAT A FIRE SCOPE HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT LOT OF THINGS HAVE COME OUT FIRES A COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL PHONE IS A COMMAND SYSTEM. AS ADOPTED BY NATIONAL LEVEL AS NAMES- NATIONALISM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S A DIRECT COPY OF THIS SYSTEM IS BUILT BY FIRE UP THROUGH CALIFORNIA- SO WE SAID ON THE U. S. SUB COMMITTEE TO AIR OPERATIONS SPECIALLY GROUP FOR FIRES WERE ON THE TO TRYING BUILD UPON. WHAT STATE LEVEL LOOKS TO GET YOU A THE ASSET AND DOWN THIS IN TIME OF MAJOR NOT JUST QUALIFY AND WE'LL SEE A SHORT HERE THAT ONCE THE FANS BUT- IN A SENSE OF EMERGENCIES STATE WHY. OUR SCOPE ROSS INVOLVED WITH GROUP CALLED JONES PONDERS IS NOT LEVEL. MATTER EXPERT GROUP THAT'S- TO. TRYING TO FIND. BE TRAIN DEPLOY THAT. WHAT SOME OF THE STUFF NEEDS TO BE REGIONALIZED A LOT OF IT NEEDS TO BE FEDERALIZED IN TERMS OF IT'S A NATIONAL STANDARD OR IT'S A NATIONAL UNDERSTANDING HOW IT'S BEST TO BE DEPLOYED- THAT'S HOW EMERGENCY SERVICES WORKS WE DO OUR WORK IN A REGION. BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WE WERE ALL IN THIS PRACTICE WITH EACH OTHER- WE ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SIT ON NASA'S STEREO GROUP WHICH IS. A SCALABLE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT FROM BURNS RESPONSE OPERATION STEREO IS- BUILDING A MANTRA MANS PROGRAM WHICH WAS SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. BASICALLY A SYSTEM SIMILAR TWENTY AFTER CONTROL DOES FOR MANNED AIRCRAFT BUT IT DOESN'T FOR UAVS THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES TO THAT BUT IT BECOMES A- TRACKING SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY INTERESTING FOR- LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE BECAUSE IT LETS US KNOW WHERE OUR ASSETS ARE. AS WELL AS MANNED ASSETS. SO THAT'S KIND OF WE COME FROM- OUR IN OUR AGENCY WERE. FORTUNATE DEEPLY INVOLVED- I'M BASICALLY GOING TO GO OVER THE TOP OF THE- HILL AND JUST SOME BACKGROUND ON WHAT WE'VE DONE. IN THE GO. TO SEE IN PUBLIC SAVE HAS IN EVERY RECENT IT'S REALLY IN WONDER WHY IT GIVES US THE ABILITY SEE THAT COULDN'T SEE THE TO GO WE HADN'T BEEN IN TO GO BEFORE THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN LIMITED BECAUSE OF COST OR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS SO YOU AB USER ARE COMMON ENOUGH SAYING NOW IN THE FIRE SERVICE IN THEIR SMALL ENOUGH AND PORTABLE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GET THEM ANYWHERE. PREDOMINATELY WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN. RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN USE ON WATER LAND- INCIDENTS WILDFIRES AND THEY THEY SURE GREAT PROMISE FOR THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY SEE MORE OF IN THE STATE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. JUST THE ABILITY TO GET THIS TYPE OF YOU FOR AN INCIDENT COMMANDER- IN IN THE INITIAL STAGE OF FIRE THIS MIGHT BE BEFORE MAJOR RESOURCES GET THEIR- IS PRETTY EPIC. THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION- THIS IS A LIVE FIRE. THIS IS ONE OF OUR PILOTS OVER FLYING A UNIT THAT WAS BEING RE DIRECTED BY THE INCIDENT COMMANDER IN SICK MAN WAS USING THE FOOTAGE COMING. BACK THE A LIVE STREAM. TO GET THAT ENGINE TO TURN LEFT THERE WHEN THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GET TO THE SPOT FIRE THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE UP HERE IN SUPPORT ANOTHER UNIT THAT WAS ACTIVELY WORKING. AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS LOOK LIKE IT'S TOUGH TO SEE FROM THE GROUND. BUT THE ABILITY TO PUT A- LIGHT AIRCRAFT OVERHEAD AND BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY HAVE THAT INFORMATION. AND PUSH IT BACK TO AN INCIDENT COMMANDER- IS HUGE IN THE FUTURE- WE CURRENTLY USE VIDEO STREAMING TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO BASICALLY PUSH OUR IMAGES TO ANY. OF OUR AUTHORIZED FOLKS ANYBODY CAN SEE IT IN THE FUTURE. PUSHING IT TO INDIVIDUAL AND COMPANIES BECOMES A VERY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE AS WELL INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MILITARY DOESN'T CASES. THIS IS A- FOR CONSTRUCTION FIRE. LIMITING TO CYCLIC HELP. BUYING A- HOT OF THE GROUP WERE ABLE TO LOCATE. SO BY JUMPING OVER THE TOP OF THIS AND USING FOR IMAGING WORKING IT WERE IN TO. GET THEM WHERE THEY NEED BE. THAT'S A FAIRLY SENSE. MEASURE FAR COVERS. NOW MILES AND- RIVER AND- WE A LOT OF TIME ON THE RIVER THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM REST CALLS A ON EVERY YEAR IT'S A VERY. HOT RIVER IT'S HEAVILY USED- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE TO SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRIES WE SPEND A LOT TIME OVER WATER- WHETHER IT BE. SEARCH AND RESCUE IDENTIFICATION OR OVERSIGHT AS THIS IS HERE'S HIS TRAINING WITH- FAMOUS CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE SEVEN OVER THE RIVER- GIVING THE INCIDENT COMMANDER OF THE CREWS ON THE GROUND A BETTER VIEW OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO. IS A PRETTY HUGE PART OF WHAT THE CAMERA SYSTEMS ALLOW- SPECIALLY WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THE COST OF THE CAMERAS BEING RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE FOR THOSE IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE CLARITY THAT THEY'RE BRINGING- THESE AIRCRAFT CAN BE WASTED OFF IN A VERY SAFE LOCATION. AND STILL GIVE YOU PRETTY IMPRESSIVE IMAGERY- THIS AIRCRAFT IS PROBABLY A LINEAR DISTANCE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AWAY. AND THAT'S- THE TAX INFORMATION WE CAN PULL BACK FOR A SICK MATTER. TECHNICAL SEARCH AND RESCUE SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DIFFICULTY IN THE FIRE SERVICE IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IT'S UNIQUE. A NOT A SELDOM USED SKILLED WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE IN- EMPLOYED IT'S KIND OF THE ONLY THING. MORE THE ONLY SEES TO IT SO. THE USE OF YOUR VISA CRAFT TO JUMP OVER THE TOP OF A COLLAPSE THIS IS COLLAPSE DOWN AND BEAR TO IMAGERY AND TO PUT THAT A MAJOR ON A REAL FOR OUR SEARCHERS TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE SEARCHING WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE IT ALSO HELPS US TO PUT AYE AYES INTO A SITUATION THAT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO PUT OUR PEOPLE INTO THE WE CAN LOOK IN. THE WHOLE LAST THING THAT OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T. A TECHNICAL RESCUE- ONE OF THE INTERESTING PARTS OF TECHNICAL RESCUE IS THAT IT HAPPENS ABOVE AND BELOW GRADE SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY ON LEVEL- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE USES WHERE BEING ABLE TO STAND BACK AND GIVES THE RESCUE TEAMS INCOMING RESCUE TEAMS ARE INCIDENT COMMANDERS VIEWS OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. ALLOWS IN THE PRE PLAN AND PRE DEPLOY THEIR RESOURCES IT'S REALLY HARD ON TECHNICAL RESCUE CALLS TO GET THE HARDWARE THAT YOU NEED IN POSITION FINALLY MANNER BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT- KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO AHEAD OF TIME LETS YOU PREPAY AND THAT SO WE'RE FLYING ON THE BACK. OF THE CHIEFS RIDE. AND BASICALLY GIVING THE INCOMING TEAM OF YOU OF WHAT THE OUTCOME TEAM WAS DOING I'VE ALSO DONE TRAINING RECENTLY WITH- FLYING THE LINES OF THE TOP OF OPTICAL SO INSTEAD OF PUSHING A LINE OUT WITH A LINE DOWN WE CAN DO IT NOW WITH AIRCRAFT AS MATERIALS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE WE SEEN HUGE INCREASE OVER THE STATE ARE OVER THE COUNTRY. ESPECIALLY IN THE EAST COAST. BEING ABLE TO PUT AN AIRCRAFT IN POSITION WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT PEOPLE AND GIVE- THE HAZMAT TEAMS OF YOU. OF PERHAPS AERIAL GAS MONITORING WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THERE WERE FLYING GAS MONITORS THROUGH A PLUME AND ALLOWING RESOURCES ON THE GROUND SEE WHERE THAT PLANE IS. MODEL IT FIGURE OUT HOW FAR IT'S GOING TO STRETCH OUT. IS A REALLY INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR USE. BECAUSE IT DOES. FLOOD HERE WE DO FLOOD OPERATIONS AS WELL THE OVER FLAT FLAT OPERATIONS IS A FAIRLY. MAJOR USE CASE FOR US WHEN IT'S RAINING. GETTING AHEAD OF A FLOODED AREA BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND LOOK AT AREAS THAT ARE CURENTLY FLOOD AND SEE WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT OUR ACCESS AND EGRESS TO THAT AREA. IS A HUGE PORTION OF GETTING US IN POSITION TO MAKE EFFECTIVE RESCUES WHEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY IT'S PRE PLANNING GETTING OUT WHEN IT'S FLOODED BEING ABLE TO LOOK OVER THE TOP OF A GIVE ARE BOTH COMPANIES AND OUR GROUND CREWS IN VIEW. OF WHAT'S GOING ON CURRENTLY SO THAT IN TWO HOURS IF THEY GET A CALL FOR ASSISTANCE THEY KNOW KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT ALREADY- THIS IS A LIVE. MISSION THIS IS A RESCUE MISSION FOR A DRIVER WHO DROVE THROUGH SOME CLOTHES ROAD SIGNS AND ENDED UP FLOODING IS VEHICLE OUT. WE ARE ABLE TO OVERFLY THIS EVEN WITH THOSE TREES AND GET A VIEW FOR OUR- FOR OUR RESCUE TEAM BEFORE THEY WALKED IN SO THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE WALKING INTO WE ALSO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO PAYLOAD DELIVERY. SO WE CAN RELEASE PFDS ON- PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES. ON TO PEOPLE WHO MAY BE STRANDED ON THE RIVER- OR IN A FLOOD SITUATION AS WE KEEP THEM SAFE. THIS IS MERRY. RIVER WHERE PEOPLE REASON LIKE TO PUT. IN EVERY COOPER STREET IS AN ACTIVE SCENES ARE BOTH CREWS WILL GO OUT AND TRY TO MAKE CONTACT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOBODY INSIDE THAT VEHICLE. THE OVERSTATE THE- BE ERICA. OVER THE HEAD AND GIVES. CREW A GREAT VIEW OF WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO BEFORE THEY GET THERE. SO THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE USES. WE FOUND FOR OUR CRAFTING WE SEE THAT USE REALLY REGION WIDE BETWEEN LINE FIRE- THE FUTURE THAT IS MORE. IN DEPTH AND COMPLICATED SENSORS ARTISTS A LOT OF SENSE IS BEING USED ANOTHER VERTICALS AGRICULTURE IN INDUSTRY THAT WILL END UP BEING ADOPTED IN AS WELL AS RAPID MAPPING- AND SEVERAL OTHER USES. TYPICAL INTERESTING THANK YOU THIRTY GOTTEN WILL. NEXT HEAR FROM- A BAY AREA PERSPECTIVE COMMANDER. MATT AGAIN FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. IT'S THE WORK ORDER I NEED TO GET TO THE SCREEN. ALL RIGHT SEE HERE. THE NOW THAT THAT CAR THAT WE SAW THE KIND OF A GHOST WHEN WAS WAS THAT. ONLY THE PEOPLE GOT OUT. WORD YEAH THERE IS NOBODY INSIDE OF THAT THAT'S A SECTION RIVER WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE KIDS LIKE TO PUSH CARS INTO THE RIVER. I DON'T LITTLE PUSH THEM IN THEIR FAST AND THEN WE GO. TO GO OVER THE EDGE SEARCHES AND FAIRLY TECHNICAL- SEARCH AND RESCUE TECH KIND OF OPERATIONS- HAPPENS AT NIGHT FAIRMOUNT TO AND AN ACTIVE AND IT WASN'T COMING. I GUESS KIDS BEING KIDS SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO IT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE TREAT ALL OF THEM IS. POTENTIALLY FIVE WERE IN THAT CASE NOT LIVE REPLIED THE RECOVERY BUT LIVE RESCUE TYPE KIND OF MISSIONS. SO YEAH THAT'S IT'S A USE. THANK YOU. THERE ARE. WHAT'S AT THE- USUALLY THEY GET BUT WE CAN AND LEFT IN PLACE UNTIL THE WEATHER IS STABLE ENOUGH AND THEN THE EITHER BRING IN BARGES SAID IT'LL BE CONTRACTOR BRINGING BARGES ARE BRING IN TOW VEHICLES DEPENDING ON WHERE IT IS A PROBLEM OUT BUT THERE'S MOVIES OUT THERE FOR CARS THAT ARE GONNA GET PULLED DOWN BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T- THEY KEEP VOTERS AWAY FROM. THE SO THE THANK YOU CENTERS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND WE'RE WE'RE HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THE PRESENTATION IS ON THE SCREEN BUT IT'S NOT UP THERE SO I WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU YOU FOLKS GET THE LINKS TO WHAT I AND HAD INTENDED TO SHOW TODAY- MY NAME'S TOM AT ECONOMIC COMMANDER WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE DOWN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA I WORK FOR AND- SHARE FAYE HEARN. W WERE EARLY ADOPTERS OF THE US TECH NOT. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST AGENCIES EVER TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY US TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE- INTER TWINED U. S. OPERATIONS INTO. ALL THE BUSINESS WE DO- OUR SHARE OF HIS IN MUTUALLY COORDINATOR FOR REGION TWO SO WE HAVE IT'S MOST ACTIVE MUTUAL AID REGION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE DEPLOYED PEOPLE ALL P AND DOWN THE CITY CALIFORNIA TO ASSIST WITH- A DANGER TO TUITIONS WHETHER IT BE A NATURAL DISASTER ALONG. RELATED EVENT. I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING. AS A DOT. SAY THE STATE INTEGRATION OF YOU A OF AN AIR THE THERE IS THERE IS HIGHWAY IN THE SKY AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FLY THE SINGS IN A SAFE MANNER SO WE NEVER HAVE ANY INCIDENT INVOLVING A MANNED AIRCRAFT AND UNMANNED AIRCRAFT IN IN SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT WERE WERE PEOPLE GET HARMED- TO THAT AND I WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA- WHO IS. ALLOWED US ACCESS TO FLY YOU A. S. IN THEIR TEETH FAR AS IN THEIR TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS DURING SOME DISASTERS IN IN GRADED SAFE AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANCE TO BE ABLE TO- UAVS IN MY OPINION- REALLY COOL MEN. THE WORK DEMAND. IF THERE. FULL CORDON FULL MANNER THE BE DONE NOW WE USE YOU A OP ROUTE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA IN VERY COMPLEX AIR SPACE IN IN COORDINATION WITH- WITH MANNED AIRCRAFT THEM WHERE THEY'RE TALKING EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT ALTITUDE THAT THERE AT WHAT THE WHAT FOR FLIGHT PARAMETERS WE HAVEN'T SO THAT'S JUST REALLY AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THINKS IT IS TO BE MADE. AND OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND WHAT I HAD INTENDED SHOW YOU AND WE'LL SEND YOU LINKS IS. WE FIRST. STARTED USING YOU AS IN% DISASTER SCENES ON BACK AT THE TRAGIC GO SHIP FIRED OAKLAND WHERE- THIRTY SIX PEOPLE TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LIVES. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE REALIZE THE U. S. COULD ADD VALUE TO THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS IN SEARCH AND RESCUE PEOPLE ARE DOING. IN TERMS OF LOOKING FOR VICTIMS THERMAL IMAGING FOR HOT SPOTS PRIOR TO SENDING PEOPLE INTO DANGEROUS AREA. AS VERY IMPORTANT STUFF SO WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT TRAGIC INCIDENT AND THAT THE FIRES IN THE NOMA CAME ABOUT IN COFFEE PARK THE TRAGEDY IN COFFEE PARK AND I HAD A MAP HERE TO SHOW YOU OF THAT. WHERE WE TO THOUSAND BASS LOW LEVEL AND STITCH THEM TO. INTO NOR OF MUSIC MATT. SO THE CITIZENS LIVE THERE BUT COULDN'T BACK IN COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP. DOWN TO STREET. IN A ONE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR- SEE WITH HAVING TO GO INTO SO. THAT MAPPING REAL AND AS PART OF A INTO GRAY AMBER MAY STRATEGY FAST FORWARD TO THE FIRES IN IN REDDING WE DID SOME MORE MAPPING OUT THERE BUT THEN WE ALSO LEARNED THAT A SMALL DRONE CAN CAN BE SET UP IN THE SKY AT A HUNDRED FEET TWO HUNDRED FEET OR WHATEVER CAL FIRE ALLOW. AND TAKE A QUICK SERIES OF SNAPSHOTS IN STITCH TOGETHER IN INDIAN ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY- A MODEL OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH STAND CAN BE UPLOADED TO THE COUNTY OR CITY'S WEBSITE AND RESIDENTS CAN CLICK ON IT AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD- FAST FORWARD TO BUTTE COUNTY. A YEAR AFTER THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO GO UP WITH THE TEAM A TEAM OF THE UAV OPERATORS FIFTEEN DIFFERENT EAMS. WITH THE PERMISSION OF CALIFORNIA THE TO IN A COORDINATED MANNER- TAKE. SEVENTY THOUSAND PHOTOGRAPHS OVER FIVE HUNDRED FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF HERE FOR YOU IN TWO DAYS AND STITCH THOSE TOGETHER WHERE- PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT THE DAMAGE THEIR PROPERTY. AND THEN WE USE A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED- SURVEY WHERE WE ENTER WE OVERLAID VIDEOS WERE NOT ONLY COULD YOU SEE YOUR YOUR PROPERTY BUT YOU COULD SEE A VIDEO FLY THROUGH OF YOUR PROPERTY. SO I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE MAPPING IS CRITICAL FOR DISASTER ZONES- IN IN IS THE FIFTH AT THE FEET COULD BE INTERRELATE OVER A SERIES OF DIFFERENT LAYERS YOU KNOW THERE'S MAPPING LAYERS. IN THIS U. S. DATA. CAN BE THEM LATE INTO THAT. ALSO IN TERMS OF URGENCY RESPONSE. I CAN'T COME. OVER TO MADE THE THERMAL IMAGING CAPABILITY- IN SO NO MY COUNTY WHEN PEOPLE WERE UNACCOUNTED FOR AND THE AUTHORITIES HAD LIKELY AREAS WHERE THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE. TO SEND A UAV AN AUNT AND GET A THERMAL IMAGE A THERMAL READING BEFORE SENDING A SEARCH AND RESCUE PERSON BEFORE STANDING CANINE IN THERE TO AREAS ARE STILL HOT. REALLY IN OR TECHNOLOGY AND ALL DIFFERS THE SCENE. YOU KNOW TO TAKE AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH AND PRESERVE THE SCENE. SO A WHOLE WHOLE CLOTHES ARE MAKE SURE YOU GET THE LINKS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMITTEE SEE THIS DATA- AND JUST IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY. I'M FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK OF IT ALL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD UTILIZE UHS TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE IT CAN HELP THEM DETECT DANGERS THEY COULD OTHERWISE NOT SEE AND KEEP THEM SAFE- AND MAY NEED TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE WORK THAT THEY DO EVERY DAY SO WHATEVER BARRIERS YOU FOLKS. CAN REMOVE TO HELP THEM GET PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUMMIT SINCE. BECAUSE THE PULSE HELLO. CAN'T USE A TECH. THAT CAN THEIR FI. AND OFFICERS FROM FROM LOSING THEIR LIVES. AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME OUT THANK YOU COMMUTER I LOVED IT JUST- FOLLOW UP ON THAT LAST COMMENT I'M YOU REPRESENT AND POLITICALLY ACTIVE COUNTY YES- ALAMEDA COUNTY- IT CAN YOU CAN YOU WEEK WE MENTION POLITICS WHAT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHICH I MIGHT. PRIVACY ACTIVISTS OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FOLKS ARE JUST KIND OF SKEPTICAL ON FORCE MANNER OR WELL SOON SO WHERE EVER I STILL REMEMBEREDTHE FIRST BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEETING AND- GIVE A PRESENTATION AS CHAIR OF THE- PRINTER. THE CHRONICLE ROAD OR THE A COVER STORY EAST BAY AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE- BAIT AND HOW. THE PEOPLE SHOWED UP. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. SPOKE AND TRY TO DO EVERYTHING HUNDRED SPOKE AGAINST WHAT WAS THEIR ARGUMENT. PRICE CAN IT WAS MAINLY PRIVACY CONCERNS. AND SO WE COMMITTED TO BE TRANSPARENT TO THE PROCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU FIVE YEARS LATER THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS WE HAVE RECEIVED NOT ONE SINGLE COMPLAIN. ABOUT INFRINGING UPON ANYBODY'S PRIVACY NOT A SINGLE ONE. AND SO- YOU KNOW THERE'S LOCAL AGENCIES WHERE A U. S. COULD ADD VALUE BUT THEY'RE HESITANT TO BRING IT IN BECAUSE OF THE BACKLASH ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SO BUT FROM WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAD ALL THIS. KIND OF FEAR CONCERN IN ITALY YES WE TOOK STEPS TO IMPLEMENT STRICT. PRIVACY PROTECTING PROTOCOLS MINUTES AS A RESULT. IN SPITE OF. ALL THAT NEGATIVE ENERGY THOSE OUT THERE IT'S YOU'RE NOT FACING CRITICISM NOT NOT AND NOT ANY AND SO THE ROBUST PUBLIC OUTRAGE SUMMERS. YOUR MODEL MAY BE A INSPIRATION OR SOMETHING TO BUILD UPON ELSEWHERE STATE YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE. LEARN FROM OUR PART BUT- IN SOME STATES TO DO ONE OF THEM HI BUT HELL. REYES TECHNO. WELL AT AM I. THINK THE IT'S A MIXED MY NO. ALUM COUNTY. WE WERE THE ONLY U. S. TEAM AND NOW I'D SAY AT LEAST HALF OF THE POLICE AGENCIES AND HALF OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE. THEY RECOGNIZE THE VALUE AND THE VALUE IS IT IS GETTING THEM THERE THE MAPPING YOU KNOW THAT CAN BE DONE AFTER THE FACT BUT THE LIFE THREATENING EVENT IT'S TRANSPIRING RIGHT NOW. IS WHERE IT IN REAL TIME IS WHERE THE TRUTH TRULY ADD VALUE- THEY THEY HAVE TO BE THERE IN A TIMELY MANNER- YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT. WE'RE LOOKING AT A BAY AREA IS WE A LOT OF MANNED AVIATION ASSETS SO IF IT THE HELICOPTER GETS THERE FIRST. FROM WHAT THE UAVS IN ROUTE ONCE ONCE THE UAV TEAM IS THERE IF YOU HAVE A DEFINED INSTANT PROMOTER TO ME IT IT IT. CAN BE DONE WITH THE U. S. A LOT CHEAPER AND JUST AS IF MORE FAT THAN A COPPER SO COPTER CAN BE ON WHAT'S NEXT AND THEN THE US. TEAM IS THERE. WORK PROBLEM FOR DOWN IN A STAGGERED MAN TO IT SIX ABOVE THE GROUND THE U. WILL NOT GO THAN A AND FIFTY FEET IT'S CHOREOGRAPHED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OF THE SAFETY ISSUES SO ACTION AND NATIONAL WILD FIRE CORNING GROUP- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS DONE A GREAT JOB OF BUILDING A PROGRAM OUT THAT ALLOW FOR MAN AND MAN IMMIGRATION IN A VERY SIMPLISTIC AND STRAIGHTFORWARD- AND IT'S WHAT WE USED ON THE FAR SIDE. TO INTEGRATE ACROSS LINES WE'VE WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN OUR REGION IN WORKING WITH BOTH- LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE HELICOPTERS AND KEEPING EVERYBODY WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN TO BE SAFE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOKED AT TO ADOPT AT THE STATE LEVEL TO MAKE THIS. A WILL PEACE THERE'S NO IT'S A IT'S A FOOT RAY EVERYBODY ON. THIS TRYING TO BUILD PROGRAM- I'VE HELPED A COUPLE DIFFERENT REGIONS BILL REGIONAL OPERATING GROUPS. AND MY FIRST DATE WITH THEM IS YOU'RE NOT ALONE YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH TRYING TO DO THIS I GUARANTEE YOU JUST SEND AN EMAIL TO EVERYBODY AROUND YOU ALL ALONG FIRE AGENCIES. AND ASK IF THEY WANT TO COME TO A MEETING. AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED WHO SHOWS UP. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THAT AND THAT COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION AND THAT THAT REGIONAL LAST THAT REGIONAL GROUPING MODEL. IS THAT IT HELPS ADMINISTRATORS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT ONE OF THINGS THAT CAME UP WAS THE IDEA OF WHERE'S WHERE'S THE PUSH BACK IS IT IS A- PUBLIC SIDE IS IT ON THE- MISTER SIDE AND- AT. HIM DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ADMINISTRATORS TO WALK DIVE LONG TO PER LIKE THIS. YOURSELF OUT THERE IS A LOT OF SCRUTINY IT'S CAL. THERE'S PUBLIC- LOT OF PUBLIC PROTECTION IN PLACE. BY HAVING MULTIPLE AGENCIES. ALREADY WORKING WITH AN ORIGINAL OPERATING GROUP GIVES AS ADMINISTRATOR SOMETHING TO LOOK AT TO GO OKAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO DOING THAT. THERE ARE. PRACTICES ARE THERE ARE OTHER AGENCIES LEAN ON TED HEY WHAT'S WORK FOR YOU WHAT HASN'T. AND WITH WITHIN THEIR OWN CIRCLES THEY- BOB DUFF AND- THAT'S- I KNOW THAT'S PROOF. IN OUR AREA. THE HILL IN THE- CONTRACT REGION WHERE THEY- REGIONAL. GROUP AND I WOULD JUST. AS WELL HELPFUL WE WANT TO GO THIS ALONE IN A- AS A MINISTRY YOU HAVE. BEEN RESPONSE. AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT. RIGHT THE SENSE. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU COMMANDER CAPTAIN FOR SHOULD PROCEED ALL THE HARD WORK THAT GOES BEHIND YOUR PRESENTATIONS TO. ALRIGHT LET'S LET'S NOW WE'RE GONNA WE WENT FROM THE LOCAL NOW WE'RE GONNA JUMP UP TO THE STATE LEVEL- WE'RE TALK ABOUT STATE USE OF REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES. IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CALLOW YESTER ACTOR MARK YOUR DO CHEAP. CHIEF TOM PORTER FROM CAL FIRE AND THEN MAJOR GENERAL BALDWIN. FROM CAL GUARD AND- WE'LL START WITH YOU DIRECTOR. NICE ONES GET THE NAME PLATES. FIXED THE COMMUTER. OKAY OUR REGION ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING PART OF ITALY'S YOUR NAME FROM- NORTHERN ITALY LOOK AT LOOK AT OF YEAH HAVE YOU BEEN HALF **** BRIDGE. WALL BACK WORLD CITY YEAH. WELL GOOD MORNING AND- MEASURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REALLY HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND TALK A LITTLE ABOUT- THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'VE JUST BEEN SEEN SOME GREAT PRESENTATIONS ON ANDREALLY PHENOMENAL- EXPLANATION ON THE USE AND HOW ARE OUR BOTH OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE USING THESE WERE- REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT OR ALSO KNOW MAYBE AS UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE OR DROWNED- YOU'LL HEAR FROM MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY OF A LEADER CALIFORNIA THAT. WE REMAIN REALLY KIND OF A NATIONAL LEADER IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR WHILE FIRE DETECTION AND VALIDATION A RESPONSE IT IS CONSTANTLY AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY SEEKING INNOVATION AND EMERGENCY MANAGED TO BETTER PREVENT MITIGATE AND RECOVER FROM ALL SORTS OF DISASTERS. CLOSE THE TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE USE OF A DROP INS AND THE PRINCIPAL BENEFITS OF THESE SYSTEMS IS THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY CAN BE DEPLOYED FOLLOWING AN INCIDENT AT THE ABILITY TO COLLECT I FORGET ON THE INTELLIGENCE IN A COST OF. MANNER ARE DRUGS CAN BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN DISASTER PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS THEY CAN BE USED TO MAP IS IN OF STORMS AND OTHER NAY DISASTER. IF I KEY A THAT ARE GOAL OR MIGHT BE DOES. IF AND THE MATH CONDEMNED AVAILABLE TO FOR RESPONDERS EMERGENCY MANAGER FOR FUTURE EVENTS. BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PRIMARY- PRIMARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT FOLLOWING DISASTERS. AND IN THE SET ESSENTIAL STEP. TOWARDS POTENTIALLY QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOLLOWING DISASTER EVENTS IN FACT- YES USED- A DRONE- KEY. DRONES FOR COUNTY THE NUMBER OF DAMAGED HOMES FOLLOWING THE WILDFIRES AND FLOODING EVENTS- WE'RE STANDING WATER WAS PRESENT AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE NORTH BAY FIRES. CALORIE AS YOU LAST DRUGS TO EXPEDITE. ASSESSMENT IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA IN ORDER TO MOVE. BUT THE STATE'S. PRESIDENTIAL MAJOR DOES DE. OF THE- OF THE MISSION MAN. ITSELF TENDS MILLIONS DOLLARS. STATE LOCAL RESPONSIBLE COVERAGE EFFORTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS WHAT IT NEEDED TO ALWAYS VERY VERY INSTRUMENTAL THEIR DRAW PAUL'S AND IN. AS WELL AFTER HURRICANE AS YOU HEARD FOR NAY AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT. HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET AROUND- GROUND UNITS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. DOZENS OF DRUGS WERE USED IN RESPONSE TO HURRICANE HARVEY IN HOUSTON AFTER HURRICANE IRMA IN FLORIDA. JONES CAN IDENTIFY STRANDED PEOPLE MORE RAPIDLY. AND AT LOWER RESEARCH BIRDS HE PERSONNEL- THEN GROUND UNITS AND THEY CAN DLIVER WATER MEDICAL SUPPLIES RESCUE EQUIPMENT. AND OTHER NECESSITIES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT BRANCH FOR EXAMPLE HAS COURTED SEARCHER SQ OPERATIONS USING- NATIONAL GUARD. ADDRESS BALLING TALK IN A FEW MINUTES THEY'VE BEEN YOU TO A FIVE LOS HIKERS THE DRUGS HAVE HIGH POWERED CAMERAS THAT CAN ALLOW CLEAR IMAGE IMAGES FROM A GOOD HEIGHT AND THERMAL IMAGING SAYS. IMAGING SENSORS THAT DETECT HEAT MAKING THAT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE AT NIGHT- THE DATA FROM THE DRUGS CAN BE. PROCESS IN REAL TIME AND SOME DRONE SOFTWARE CAN DISCERN A PERSON AN ANIMAL OR VEHICLE FROM JUST A HANDFUL OF PIXELS RECOGNITION SOFTWARE CAN BE OPERATED THROUGH A MOBILE PHONE MAKING A VERY COST EFFECTIVE TOOL TO THE RESPOND OR ON THE GROUND. HELLO YES ALSO WORKING WITH CAL FIRE IN THE U. S. FOR SERVICE EMPLOYEE DRONES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. TOGETHER INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT OF TREE MORTALITY IN WALL AND AREAS DURING THE DROUGHT HELPING TO ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL FUEL FOR WILDFIRES. ARIES APPEAL INFESTATION- IN DEAD AND DYING TREES AND SITES MOST NEEDED IN AND A NEED OF HAZARD ME THROUGH TRUE. AS OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE BRANCH IS EQUIPPED TO USE DRONES WITH VIDEO AND STILL IMAGE RECORDING CAPABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS INSPECTING POWER INTO. INTENT LAW AND DID HIS FOR FOURTEEN MAINTENANCE OR DAMAGED AFTER BASS. SURVEY MIKE. FOR OBSTRUCTION. OF. LEAGUE WE'RE HELPING TO DEVELOP STATEWIDE- INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS A GREATER INTEGRATION UP OUR PA TECHNOLOGY BUT WE ARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FIRE SCOPE OUR EARLIER THAT'S IS ON THE FAR SIDE WERE ALSO WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT COUNTERPARTS. IN FOR THE BUILD OUT OF REGIONAL CAPABILITIES. AND OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION BRAD'S AS A BUILD UP THE NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WERE PROVIDING- IP CONNECTIONS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO TRANSMIT VIDEO AND OTHER INFORMATION FROM A DRONE. AS WE COMPLETE THE FIRST THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR EIGHT NINE ONE ONE. WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT STATEWIDE COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH AND DATA SHARING OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE. USED TO HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSFER VIDEO AND DATA FROM A DRONE MUCH LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU HEARD OUR OUR INITIAL PRESENT AT THE PRESENT PRESENTERS TALKING ABOUT- THE IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGY WILL REQUIRE- AND INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT PROTOCOLS AND SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THE DRUGS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND DRONE USE DOES NOT THREATEN LIVES SAFETY PROPERTY PRIVACY RIGHTS. OR EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AS THE STATE'S HOMEMADE SECURITY AGENCY WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON SECURITY CONCERNS CREATED BY DRONE USE IN THE STATE. SUCH AS CHINESE DEVELOP DRONES COUNTER INTELLIGENCE AND THE THREAT OF CONTRABAND TO PRISONS CALIFORNIA IS AT RISK. TO THE UNAUTHORIZED AND MALICIOUS USE OF DRONES DUE TO AN ABUNDANCE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE. AND THE STATE'S EXTENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE PORTFOLIO. THE STATE A THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER HAS ASSESSED THE CALIFORNIA. WAS THE NATION WIDE LEADER IN TWO THREE NINETEEN FOR ON AUTHORIZE. ON IN. THIRD CONSECUTIVE. CAL TO EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD. BEFORE OF THE WAY THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ON A- OWN ENCOUNTERS MOST WHICH OCCURRED IN LOS. THE THAT THE IS GOING INTO EITHER RESTRICTED AIRSPACE OR- COMING A CONTACT CLOSE CONTACT WITH A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER. THOSE ARE THOSE MOSTLY ENTHUSIASTS YEAH RIGHT SUMMER MEDIA DRIVEN AND SOME ARE- SOME ARE. PRIVATE PHOTOGRAPHERS MY TO GET GET PHOTOS- REALLY DELAYED BECAUSE THAT'S MOST PEOPLE ARE YEAH I JUST OF DENSITY POPULATION AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THE MEDIA MARKET IN LA IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SO THEY A LOT OF THOSE- JONES HAVE. AND CITED AT AIRPORTS STADIUMS CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AMUSEMENT PARKS POLITICAL EVENTS. AND OTHER HIGH COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC SITUATIONS MAKING DRONE USE AN OBVIOUS SECURITY CONCERN FOR THE STATE AND YOU KNOW IT'S A- KEY CONCERN ON THE SECURITY FRONT LIKE WHEN WE HAVE. A MAJOR SPORTING EVENT LIKE THE SUPERBOWL OR EVEN JUST. AN LA RAMS GAME OF FLYING DRONES OVER THE STADIUM AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DROPPING. CERTAIN KINDS OF. BIO HAZARD OR OTHER KINDS OF THING THE COULD COULD IMPACT PUBLIC IN RECENT YEARS THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN STATE ALL MY SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE WORKED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF- DRONE COUNTERMEASURES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF. OF DRUNK COUNTERMEASURES ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SIZE OF THE DRONE THE DISTANCE OF THE DRONE. WHO CONTROLS THE DEVICE AND WHETHER THE DRONE IS LOCATED IN U. S. TERRITORY. COUNTER DRONE DETECTION AND TRACKING SYSTEMS ARE AVAILABLE IN A VARIETY OF FORMS INCLUDING A RADAR. RADIO FREQUENCY ELECTRO OPTICAL INFRARED ACOUSTIC AND COMBINE SENSORS- THE COUNTER- DRONE TECHNOLOGIES USED ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TARGET. AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY AUTHORITIES REGARDING DRONES COUNTERMEASURES RESIDE ONLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CURRENTLY. AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE AUTHORITIES EXTENDED DOWN THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL IS THE PROTECT. CAPABILITIES OF FOLKS CAL FIRE WHICH MIGHT OF FIGHT FIRES IN A CAMP BECAUSE THE TOP ARE BEING. IMPACTED THE BROWN. SO WHETHER STABBING IN THIS ASK AREA DATA FOR MY RECEIPT RESCUER. THE OF AUTHORIZED ONCE. PHONE AND ON TO MEASURES IN A- THE BILL TO ENHANCE CAL OF THE PLAN PREPARE WE TO AND RECOVER THREATS AND HAS THROUGHOUT STATE AND SO IT FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES A LOT ABOUT THIS WHOLE TECHNOLOGY- TO NEW AND- YOU KNOW- WERE BIG STICK A LOT OF ACTIVITY GOING ON. THE ONLY STATE THIS THE BEAM STATES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ROUTE THE UNITED ARE REALLY DEVELOPING A CAPABILITY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OUR NEXT CENSUS YOU ORDER. THANK YOU CHAIR A AND MAY OF THIS COMMITTEE- FOR HAVING THE A CHANCE TO ADDRESS YOU AND GIVE YOU KIND OF A BRIEFING ON WHAT KIND OF USES WE ARE- CURRENTLY SEEING. FROM CAL FIRE- AND IN THE WHILE IN FRONT OR WANT TO GET ANY FEEDBACK GIVE THAT BACK. AND AGAIN TO A COUPLE THINGS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'M AWARE OF USING- THIS- REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT KIND OF SYSTEMS FOR OUR OWN USE- AT CAL FIRE- WAS WAS- ACTUALLY- FATAL ACCIDENT ONE OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS- WAS HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY. AND KILLED- WE OUR OUR- SAFETY- FOLKS IN RIVERSIDE UNIT HAD A CAMERA MOUNTED ON A ON A SMALL REMOTELY POWER- PILOTED AIRCRAFT AND WERE ABLE TO AGREED THE AREA AND WE USE THAT FOOTAGE FOR- FOR OUR SERIOUS ACCIDENT REVIEW VERY KEY- TO HAVE THAT VIEW AND THAT CAPABILITY. IN THAT KIND OF TYPE OF- SCENARIO SO THE FIRST TIME THOSE TWO THOUSAND TEN. AFTER THAT ANALOGY I'M GONNA GET MORE INTO WILD FIRE WHAT WHAT WAS THE WILD FIRE KIND OF A SETTING FOR THIS THE SMALL REMOTELY- BISLETT AIRCRAFT ARE ARE GOOD FOR SMALL AREAS OR AS YOU CAN STAY AS WE HEARD IN- THE PREVIOUS- TESTIMONY. THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD FOR SEEING CERTAIN PARTS OF FIRES BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS- WE WENT INTO A PERIOD- AROUND 200-013-1213 WHERE WE ARE STARTING TO HAVE MASSIVE WILDFIRES. MIGHT HAPPEN EARLIER THAN THAT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT TECHNOLOGY HADN'T CAUGHT UP. SO WHERE WE ARE- IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IS THE RIM FIRE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES JUST APPEARED STANISLAUS NOW NATIONAL FOREST. AND WE USED- AT THAT TIME- CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD M. Q. NINE- PREDATOR TYPE. ASSISTANT VIEWING OF THE FIRE TO WATCH WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE GROUNDS TO IDENTIFY PERIMETER IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS IDENTIFY- SPOTS OVER LINES AND LOOK AT THE PROGRESSION AND WHERE THE FIRE WAS. LIKELY TO IMPACT BOTH OUR OUR CREWS ON THE GROUND BUT ALSO- OR- COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THAT WAS THAT WAS THE FIRST LARGE SCALE USE- AND IT WAS VERY TELLING AS TO WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY WAS GONNA TAKE US. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONSUME IT IN THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONSUME IT AND WE ARE STARTING TO CONSUME IT CURRENTLY. WE COULD SEE THINGS BUT WE COULDN'T COMMUNICATE TO THE GROUND TROOPS WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THEIR LOCATION THAT WE COULD SEE- FROM A DISTANCE. SO MOVING- AND DIRECTOR GIL DUDE SHE MENTIONED- USE OF AGAIN AM TO NINE TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES- AS A- TIME SORRY SORRY COMMANDER MATT AGAIN- MENTIONED IN THE- THE NORTH BAY FIRES WE USE THAT DURING FIRE ACTIVITY AS WELL AS POST FIRE FOR DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND- NEIGHBORHOOD KIND OF- INFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES- VERY- IMPORTANT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO. WITH M. Q. NINE AND HOT A HIGH LEVEL OF- AND- KIND OF OFF IN THE DISTANCE PERSISTENT LOOKING IS WE WERE ABLE TO WATCH WHAT THE FIRE WAS DOING. AROUND AND ABOVE- YON PHIL- THE VETERANS HOME WHICH WAS WAS- THREATENS THROUGHOUT THAT THAT- PERIOD AND VERY MUCH OF A CONCERN WE NEVER HAD TO EVACUATE. ALL OF THE YOUR BILL SILLY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO WATCH AND SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND MAKE REAL TIME DETERMINATION THAT THAT WAS NOT GOING TO BE A THREAT. SO WORD WE'VE USED- AGAIN AM TO NINE AND OTHER- NATIONAL GUARD TECHNOLOGIES- WITH- THE CAMPFIRE WOLSEY- THE HILL FIRE MENDOCINO COMPLEX THE CAR FIRE FERGUSON ALL OF THESE FIRES WERE JUST IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE. AND WE BEND CONTINUALLY DEPLOYING A AND REQUESTING- BOTH THROUGH- CALLOW YES MISSION TASKING BUT ALSO A DIRECT- REQUEST TO THE GUARD WHICH WE HAVE. AUTHORIZATION TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY WERE THE ONLY CAL OR ALMOST ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT CAN DO THAT. FOR EMERGENCIES RELATED TO WILDFIRE- WE CAN DEPLOY- THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS FOR OUR USE. A VERY IMPORTANT INTERESTINGLY AS WELL WE'VE WE'VE ENGAGED- WITH- NOT ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT- BUT ALSO PRIVATE VENDORS- WE USED A PRIVATE VENDOR FOR- THE CAMPFIRE ORIGIN DETERMINATION SO WE CAN GET A VIEW OF THE AND A VERY ARTICULATED- AND FINE GRAIN VIEW OF THE SITE WHERE THE CAMPFIRE ACTUALLY START. VERY IMPORTANT FOR WORK. YOU CAN SEE HOW I AM I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO ALL OF THOSE OTHER- USES A CAL FIRE IS THE SINGLE LARGEST FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND WE USE- TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY JUST AS CAPTAIN GIFFORD- MENTIONED AND SHOWED WE GET WE CAN AND WILL NEED TO DO MORE OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS HIS TESTIMONY- FROM THE FIRE PERSPECTIVE AND WE SUPPORT THAT FOR ALL OF THE FIRE SERVICES- ON FIRE USES THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO- CAL FIRE. OR FIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS MAKING SURE THAT THE ARE ARE LOOKING AT ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES. EIGHT ORIGIN AND BECAUSE I ALREADY MENTIONED ALL OF THAT I VERY IMPORTANT- THE ALL HAZARD- USES THAT THAT- CAPTAIN GIFFORD MENTIONED. BUT ONE THAT THAT IS A LITTLE MORE UNIQUE TO- CAL FIRE MISSION WHICH IS TO OUR OFFICES STATE FIRE MARSHAL IS. A HAZARDOUS- LIQUIDS PIPELINES AND THE ASSESSMENT OF- ISSUES RELATED TO THOSE- BOTH ON THE INSPECTION SIDE BUT ALSO- DETERMINING WHERE THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES. THOSE LINES LEAKING AND OTHER OTHERWISE- THE A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS AS DIRECTOR GIL DUDE SHE MENTIONED VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR OUR- RESOURCE OUR OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT- NEEDS AND RESILIENCE. OF OUR FOREST AND MONITORING THAT THE- APPLICATION FOR LOOKING AT ALL ANY OF OUR FACILITIES AND- REMOTELY DETERMINING WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME SOME ISSUES OF MAINTENANCE OR OTHERWISE. KEY IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THIS RPA ARE. SOMETHING THE CALIFORNIA- NEEDS AND WILL USE- GOING FORWARD FOR BOTH WILD FIRE AND ON FOR AWHILE FIRE OPERATIONS- WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO- AND APPRECIATIVE OF OUR ABILITY TO WORK WITH- CALLOW YES AND- CAL GUARD IN DEPLOYING THESE RESOURCES TO MEET THE MISSION OF OUR DEPARTMENT TO SAFE ARE THE PUBLIC. AND MITIGATE- IT'S- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD ANY QUESTIONS WHEN. TIME ALLOWS EASY FOR HER WE'RE NEXT TO HEAR FROM ME GENERAL BALL WHEN HE'S GOT A VERY IMPRESSIVE. THE RIBBONS IN MY PENS HIS WE WOULD ARE YOU MOST PROUD ON YOUR UNIFIED AMERICA. MOST OF OUR JUST FOR SHOWING UP TO WORK THAT. THE ESPECIALLY PROUD OF THE KID I'M DAVE I'M THE BALDWIN THE ENGINE GENERAL CALL WHICH I CAN THEE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD AND OUR OWN STATE CARD AS MENTIONED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- YES AND CAL FIRE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE PIONEERED THE FIRST USE OF LARGE MILITARY DRONES- FOR DOMESTIC SUPPORT LOW FORTIES SINCE THEN WE'VE MATURED INVOLVED ARE PROCESS SEES SO NOW WE ROUTINELY USE BOTH ARE LARGE. NATIONAL GUARD DRONES AS WELL AS OUR ARMY NATIONAL GROWTH CARD DRONES TO CAL FIRE WITH FIRE MAPPING ASSIST- YES WITH DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND WE BEEN DONE SIR. USE WE FOR THE SURVIVOR BECAUSE OF THE A CAPABILITIES OF THE DRAW AIRCRAFT PUT UP. ON A WEAK TO MATURE. OUR TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES AND DOING THIS AND QUIRK CONCERT MAINLY WITH CAL FIRE AND OUR INTELLIGENCE ANALYSTS AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE WITH OUR DRONES TO TEAM THEM WITH SPACE SPACE SYSTEMS. PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED SYSTEMS THAT WE CAN NOW USE TO GET BETTER IMAGERY AND TWO Q. AND TO DETECT RAPIDLY OF FIRE STARTS ON OFTEN BEFORE SOMEONE SEES A RECALLS NINE ONE ONE WE CAN QUEUE THAT. GET THAT OVER TO CAL FIRE DISPATCHERS GET A DROPPER HAD THEY'RE ABLE TO- PUT THOSE FIRES OUT VERY QUICKLY- THE LATEST THING WE'RE WORKING UP IS INCORPORATING- THE DEPARTMENT OF. SOCIAL CAL ABILITY TO. EVEN MORE LEAVE THE USE COMPUTERS. TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT AND ANALYZE FAR STARTS AND POTENTIAL THREATS- OUR NUMBER ONE. PRIORITY THIS YEAR TO THE US KHAN IS EXPAND OUR DRAW FLEET BY ADDING- CORRECT EAGLE AIRCRAFT WHICH IS AN ARMY NOW GUARD LARGE DRUM SYSTEM. WHICH WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DRONE WE HAVE. CALIFORNIA SAN. MORE BILL. YOU CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE THE WE FACE IN DEALING WITH REMOTELY PIE AIRCRAFT AND DRUM MAKE HAS TO DO WITH FORTIES THE FIRST IS DIRECTOR GIL DO SHE MENTIONED IS THE AUTHORITY TO DEPLOY A CAT ARE YOU A US SYSTEMS SO THAT WE CAN- EITHER TAKE CONTROL OR DENY THE USE OF POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES OR JUST. PEOPLE THEY'RE GOOD FOR AROUND THE GET IN THE WAY OF FIRE OR CONTRABAND INTO PRISON SMUGGLE STUFF ACROSS THE BORDER WE EVEN HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE. OUT A WEEK SOMEONE WAS FLYING A DRONE OVER OUR ALERT F. FIFTEEN FIGHTER JETS. AT OUR BASE IN FRESNO THEY'RE FULLY ARMED AIRCRAFT- NOW WE THINK THAT WAS JUST AN ENTHUSIAST BUT A CRISPIN SOMEONE THE MENTAL HARM. TAKE THAT DOWN WE DON'T THERE ARE FAA RESTRICTIONS AGAINST IT NOR DO WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY. SO WE DON'T YET HAVE FIELDED IN THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD OR THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD FOR YOU WORK WITH THE FAA TO TRY TO GET TO ADDRESS THE WORK OF THE FAA AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH YOU. TO DEVELOP AND PROCURE ASSIST THAT WOULD REALLY AND BUS TO. A DEFEAT DRONES THAT WE DON'T WANT FLY AROUND WE WOULD MAINLY USE AND SUPPORT CAL FIRE AND CORRECTIONS. HERE IN THE STATE. THE OTHER AREA THAT WE HAVE CHAPTERS IS JUST WITH THE AUTHORITY TO USE. THE AUTHORITY TO USE LARGE- YOU AS OR REMOTELY PILOTED SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW THE ONLY ITEM IN IN THE INVENTORY THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD THAT- THE GOVERNOR OR I CANNOT DIRECT IN ROME OR FORTY TO USE IN SUPPORT OF. CAL FIRE SEATS PEER ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR- YES THESE ARE LARGE DRONES THAT AUTHORITY REMAINS RESIDENT WITH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SO EVERY TIME WE USE A DRONE WHY USE IT A LARGE STRONG WE HAVE TO GO TO THE PORTION OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE. TO GET PERMISSION OUR GOVERNOR PERSONALLY INTERVENE IN THE PAST YEARS AND WAS ABLE TO GET BLANK FORTY. FOR A YEAR AT A TIME. THE TO ENABLE US TO VALUE CLOSEST FOR AWHILE. BUT WE CAN'T USE THEM WITH GOING THROUGH. RATHER CUMBERSOME. FIRST GRAY RESPONSE FOR.
