MAKING THE MONEY FOR THE OWNERS

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:27.926
SHOULD BE INCREASED THE

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:45.911
IT IS MENTIONED EARLIER THE

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:49.548
READING INJURY SO MUCH HIGHER-

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.684
FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS. THREE

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.587
TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:56.121
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING IN A

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:57.690
WAREHOUSE AND FOR THOSE WORKING

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:01.660
IN AMAZON WERE HOUSES EVEN. AND

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.662
IT'S JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID

00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:05.664
BECAUSE OF THE TIMELINE. WISE

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.533
IS LOOKING INTO GETTING

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.702
AUTOMATIC NOTICES NOT EVEN

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.704
HUMAN CONTACT. THE COMPUTERS

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:12.338
TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT WORKING

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.972
FAST ENOUGH YOU HAVEN'T DONE

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.841
ENOUGH BOXES AND NOW YOU NEED

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.843
TO STEP IT UP AND THEN YOU'VE

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.912
GOT TO GET SENT TO RETRAINING

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:21.947
AND YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW YOU YOU

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:25.784
MIGHT BE FIRED. WITHOUT HUMAN

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:26.285
BEING EVER TALKING TO.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:29.722
SOMETHING THE WRONG ABOUT THAT.

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.890
BUT FOR ME HONESTLY THE BIGGEST

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:33.926
ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS THE HUMAN

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:37.863
IMPACT. KNOWING THAT NOT JUST

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.132
ALL WORK IT'S ALSO ALL OF THOSE

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:45.938
AROUND. FOR AMAZON MAYBE IT WAS

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.973
VERY VOCAL AND JOIN WITH MANY

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.109
LABOR AND- NOT EVERYBODY LABELS

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:52.244
IN THE GREEN. WE STILL LOVE ALL

PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE LABOR.

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:03.956
THE ISRAEL. WE HAVE TO FIND

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.991
BETTER WAYS TO THIS IS THE

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:08.026
INDUSTRY'S. IT'S GOING TO BE

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:12.197
FOUND. THEY HAVE TO BE A BETTER

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.999
WAY TO. WHETHER YOU TO

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:17.936
ELECTRIFY COMING IN AND THEY'RE

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.072
COMING. OR ONE OF THE MOST

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:23.976
IMPORTANT THING. THOSE WERE

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.646
LONG LABOR BUT ONE OF THE MOST

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.982
IMPORTANT THING. TO MAKE SURE.

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:32.050
SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FIGHT.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:37.990

ALSO PRESSURED TO WORK VERY

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:44.329
VERY FAST- PRESSURE TO MAKE

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.464

AMAZON WAREHOUSES OR FACE

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:50.335
TERMINATION THIS IS. VERY VERY

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.570
STRESSFUL IN THIS ALSO PUT

00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:54.539
PRESSURE ON THEM. TO NOT FOLLOW

00:27:54.606 --> 00:27:56.374
THE SAFETY PROCEDURES RIGHT

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.376
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T. THEY

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:00.779
THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RATE OR

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:02.380
THEY MIGHT GET. FROM THESE WORK

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:02.914
RATES ARE REALLY REALLY

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:04.649
STRINGENT VERY HIGH AND THEY

OFTEN SEEM TO BE GOING UP. THEY

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.255
ARE ALSO BEING- SURVEILLED

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.490
ELECTRONICALLY IN TERMS OF NOT

ERROR RATE. TIME ON. TASK ALL.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.465
YEAH THIS PRESSURE ON THEM NOT

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:22.400
TO USE THE BATHROOM NOT TO

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:24.335
FOLLOW SAFETY PROCEDURES. SO

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.271
THIS IS TAKING A REAL HOLE

00:28:26.337 --> 00:28:26.938
RIGHT ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:28.640
THE WORK BREAKS ARE OFTEN

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.442
INSUFFICIENT GIVEN THE SIZE OF

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.076
THE FACILITIES AND HOW LONG IT

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:32.710
TAKES TO GET. THE BREAK ROOM OR

THE AUTOMATED WE'RE HOUSES.

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:56.401

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:58.503
THE RATES. EVEN HIGHER WITH

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE JOB

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:51.209
QUALITY IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAN

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:56.614
JOB LONG. RIGHT THIS AREA ABOUT.

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.650
THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.518
MOST FACILITIES IS NOT ALONE

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.720
AUTOMATION PARTIAL AUTOMATION

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:04.622
AND LABOR AUGMENTATION WITH

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:05.189
POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:10.495
JOBS. SO RATHER THAN WIDESPREAD

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.864
AUTOMATION IN THE NEAR TERM AND

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.532
WE'RE TALKING THE NEXT DECADE.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.133
THIS IS IN THE PIECE OF WORK

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:16.934
PROCESS AND DISTILLING JOBS. IN

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:18.836

MANAGEMENT VOICE UNDERMINE

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.807
LOOKING. THAT'S THE NEXT

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.575
WORKERS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:25.143
THE WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.611
WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY BEAR

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.579
THE BRUNT OF THE CHANGE. AND

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.548
THE LEADING EDGE IS DRIVEN BY.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.717

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.519

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.187
THIS CHART IS IMPORTANT-

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:11.022
RESEARCH SHOWS EMPLOYMENT IN

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:14.659
RED AND WE JUST MOVED IN

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.694
200-012-2018 THE THING TO NOTE

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.663
HERE IS THAT INFLATION ADJUSTED

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:19.197
WAGES IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:20.898
ACTUALLY FALLEN TWO THOUSAND

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:22.867
ONE IT'S OTHER MOST RAPID

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.669
DECLINE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:25.269
AT THE SAME TIME EMPLOYMENT

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:26.938
ROSE SHARPLY THIS IS COUNTER

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:28.906
INTUITIVE. ARE AT WHEN

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:30.808
EMPLOYMENT DEMAND RISES CLASSIC

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.777
ECONOMIC MODELS PREDICT THAT

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.879
WAGES WILL RISE TO THE TAKE

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:35.513
AWAY IN WAREHOUSING IS THAT WE

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.048
JUST HAS STAGNATED FOR NEARLY

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.883
TWO DECADES THEY'RE FALLING NOW

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:44.689
AND THEY ARE THE LOWEST POINT.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:45.289
TWO THOUSAND ONE. WHEN HOUSING

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:45.757
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:46.758
EFFICIENT OPERATION OF THE

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:47.358
PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION SO

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:49.093
SUPPLY AND DEMAND. NEEDS IN A

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.895

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:52.697
COMPONENT OF FIRMS COMPETITIVE

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:53.264
STRATEGIES. BUT IT'S BEEN A

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.932
LAGGARD IN TERMS OF

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:56.801
TECHNOLOGICAL ADOPTION FOR A

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.970
FEW REASONS. ONE VERY NARROW

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.705
MARGIN NEED THAT THE INDUSTRY

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.807
IS HIGHLY COST SENSITIVE. THIS

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.642
BAND FINANCIAL CONSERVATISM

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.744
RESULT IN RISK OF VERSION FOUR

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:07.378
FIRMS TRY TO AVOID TAKING ON

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.113
RISK FOR SHIFTED TO ON TO OTHER

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.982
COMPANIES. LIKE SUBCONTRACTORS

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.084
AND TEMP AGENCIES. AND BECAUSE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.952
OF THIS OUTSOURCING IS A

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:16.621
PREVALENT PRACTICING WAREHOUSE.

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:17.188
OUTSOURCING DYNAMICS HAVE

00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.023
TENDED TO SLOW THE PROCESS OF

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.858
INNOVATION. FINALLY THE

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.994
INDUSTRIES IS IN THE MIDST OF A

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.629
PEOPLE ROBBED BY YOU COMMERCE.

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:26.798

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:29.100

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:30.701
LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS OF

SUPPORTERS. AND ON THE OTHER

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.639
HAND YOU HAVE ROOMS COMPETING

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:35.173
WITH AMAZON'S ABILITY TO

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.643
DELIVER QUICKLY WHICH IS SHAPED

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:39.277
CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS CROSS THE

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.812
BORDER. AMAZON IS HAVING

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.713
WIDESPREAD EFFECT ACROSS THE

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.684
RETAIL AND LOGISTICS SECTORS.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.986
WE'RE HEADING TOWARD CHANGES IN

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:49.487
THE QUALITY OF JOBS IN

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:52.757
WAREHOUSES FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:53.291
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE WORK

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.026
INTENSIFICATION. ROSE WITH HIS

00:34:55.092 --> 00:34:56.627
HEART ON BODIES AS WE'VE HEARD.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.197
THAT THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL

00:34:59.263 --> 00:34:59.797
TO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.065
REDUCE- THE MOST ARDUOUS

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:03.034
ACTIVITIES LIKE TWISTING AND

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.002
LIFTING. HOWEVER OUR RESEARCH

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.771
FOUND THAT THOSE GAINS MAY BE

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.840
CANCELED OUT. INCREASES IN

00:35:08.906 --> 00:35:10.875
WORKLOAD AND PIECE OF WORK. ONE

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:11.476
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A HANGING

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.044
BAG OVER. EACH BAG HOLDS

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.946
TOGETHER KIND OF ITEM IS

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:17.114
DELIVERED TO WORK STATION YOU

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.783
SEE HERE THE WORKERS. THIS IS

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.317
THE RULES WALKING AND CAN

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:21.219
REDUCE EXPOSURE TO OTHER ORGANS

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.920
ARE GOING ON THE WRIST. BUT IT

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.789
ALSO SERVES TO CLOSELY TRACK

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:25.423
THE PRODUCTIVITY OF WORKERS AND

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.225
PIECES THEIR WORK I CONSTANTLY

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.093
DELIVERING PACKAGES TO THE

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.897
WORKER ADDED TO FIND ME. THE

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.832
SECOND CHANGE IS DE SKILLING

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:35.333
WHICH IS THE PROCESS OF

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.801
BREAKING UP A JOB INTO SMALLER

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.970
TASKS. AND FIGURING OUT WHICH

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:39.570
ACTIVITIES TO SIMPLIFY SCIENCE

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.807
TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO PROVIDE

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:43.374
TASK TO EXPAND THE POTENTIAL

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.176
WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.811
BE ABLE TO HIRE TEMPORARY

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.880
WORKERS BECAUSE YOU REMOVE THE

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:49.480
NEED FOR ANY FAMILIARITY WITH

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:51.115
THE WAREHOUSE. IT ALSO SHORTENS

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:53.050
TRAINING TIME AND REDUCES YOUR

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:53.584
TURN OVER FIVE. DIFFERENT

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:56.754
PLAYERS IT'S A WIN. FOR WORKERS

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.823
IT COULD MEAN LOWER WAGES AND

00:35:58.890 --> 00:35:59.457
MORE CHURNING THROUGH TEMPORARY

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:01.325
JOB. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:03.127
FOLLOW ME ON A MOBILE ROBOT

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:05.062
SHOWN HERE. IT LEADS WORKERS

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:07.131
ACROSS THE WAREHOUSE FACING

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:08.766
THEM AS THEY WALK AND PICK

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.935
BORDERS IT SIMPLIFIES THE ORDER

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.737
OF SELECTION PROCESS. THE

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:13.304
SYSTEM REMOVES ALL DECISION

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:14.872
MAKING BY THE WORKERS AND SET

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.941
THE WATER SPEED AND ROUTE. BY

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.809
SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS ANY

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:19.410
PLAYER COULD BRING SOMEONE IN

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.245
OFF THE STREET VIRTUALLY TETHER

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:23.147
THEM TO THIS CARD. IN A WAY

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:25.149
THEY- THE FINAL BUDGET OF

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:27.084
CHANGE IS SURVEILLANCE AN

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.886
ALGORITHMIC MANAGEMENT. I WOULD

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.022
MAKE MANAGEMENT INTRODUCES NEW

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:32.757
FORMS OF WORKPLACE CONTROL

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:33.357
WHERE THE REGULATION OF WITH

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:36.761
THIS PERFORMANCE IS GRANULAR.

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:37.261
SCALABLE AND POTENTIALLY

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.863
REMEMBER. THIS IS NEW I

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.932
VISIBILITY TO MONITOR WITH THIS

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.767
PRECISE MOVEMENTS AT DALY

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:43.401
SOMETHING'S NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.236
BEFORE. THERE'S VERY LITTLE

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:47.171
TRANSPARENCY INTO WHAT DATA IS

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.873
BEING COLLECTED FOR WHAT

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.540
PURPOSE AND HOW IT'S BEING USED

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.142
AND STORED. AND THERE'S NO

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.210
TRANSPARENCY INTO THE SOFTWARE

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:55.112
RULES THAT ARE MANAGING AND

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:57.014
GOVERNING WORK PLACES. THERE

00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:59.183
ARE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ON

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.985
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:01.586
COULD RESULT SMALL. EMPLOYEE

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.321
MORALE COULD BE DAMAGED. TURN

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.323
OVER FIFTY INCREASE OVER WORK

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.325
AND BURN OUT. THE MOST ALARMING

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:09.327
ARE THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AND

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.195
SAFETY IMPACT. THE WORKERS ARE

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.030
AT AN ELEVATED RISK OF INJURY

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:14.899
BUT WHEN YOU ADD INCREASED

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:15.466
WORKLOAD AND SPEED UP TO THE

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.335
MIX. ATTENTION FOR HEALTH AND

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:19.070
SAFETY RISK INCREASE. THE LONG

HUMANS CREATE TECHNOLOGY WE

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.215
BAKE OUR BIASES IN ON THE FRONT

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:33.017
HAND AND WE MAKE CHOICES ABOUT

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:33.618
HOW TO GET IMPLEMENTED ON THE

A LOT BETTER DEVELOP. I TALKED

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:56.566
TO DOING. THERE WERE NO REPORTS

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:57.133
OF REALLY TRY TAKE THE HIGH

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.436
ROAD GALLIMORE MORE MORE THAN

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:04.240
THIS AMOUNT. RESIDENTS REALLY

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:06.276
APPRECIATE IT DONALD TRUMP.

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.478
BEHIND US ON THAT AS WELL BEEN

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:14.484
ON. SHOT ON YALL RESIDENTS WE

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.252
CAN HANDLE NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:22.225
AMAZING IF THEY'RE NOT GOING.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.661
THE SOME OF THE OWNERS. SOME OF

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:28.464
LOS. I'VE BEEN HEARING CERTAIN

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:30.533
INDIVIDUALS. SAY THAT THEY KNOW

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.370
THAT. THEY KIND OF GOTTEN AWAY

00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:36.272
WITH THAT LAST YEAR. THEY

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:40.410
HAVEN'T DONE. AND I THINK IT'S

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:58.227
TIME WE ALL SIT DOWN.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.354
LEAD UP

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:02.358
TO THE QUESTION WHAT. VERY VERY

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:02.959
SPECIFICALLY MAYBE A ONE HERE

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.594
TO THERE WHAT OTHER THINGS

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.462
LEGISLATURE CAN DO VERY. VERY

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:10.500
GOOD. THIS SITE THIS IS THE

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.535
NEXT SESSION ACTUALLY START TO

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.737
IMPACT THE ISSUES OF. BUT I

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.739
SAFETY AND HOW TECHNOLOGIES

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.474
BEING USED IN THIS CASE. IT

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.610
SEEMS LIKE TO. INCREASE THE

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:24.414
NUMBER OF INJURIES RATHER THAN.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.482
SO I DIDN'T JUMP IN BUT- JUST

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:27.116
WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IN

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.751
TERMS OF SPECIFIC LEGISLATION

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.686
OUR IDEAS ARE FALSE IDEAS THAT

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:34.323
YOU THINK WOULD ACTUALLY BE A

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:40.296
BACK TO THE NOT JUST WITH.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.698
FIRST OF ALL I WILL SAY. THIS

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:44.534
IS LIKE WE ARE JUST AT THE

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.636
FRONT EDGE OF. RIGHT AS I THE

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.571
ONE THING WE NEED IS GATHERING.

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:54.310
OF FOLKS LIKE THIS- TO HASH OUT

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.312
WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.448
FOR. THAT SAID I THINK- IT IS

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.683
CAL OSHA. RESPONSIBILITIES TO

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.518
BE TRACKING THESE AND SO THE

01:02:02.585 --> 01:02:04.620
MORE THAT CAL OSHA CAN GET

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.589
INVOLVED IN THIS THAT. THAT THE

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.658
TRACKING OF INJURY RATES AND

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:10.460
THEN TRIGGER INVEST IN THE

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.495
PARTICULAR FACILITIES. AND THEN

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.464
YOU ANALYZE THE PATTERNS ACROSS

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.031
THOSE FACILITIES AND START

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.632
GETTING AT THE ROOT CAUSES. OF

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.668
INJURY RATES- AND START TO

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:20.703
DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.638
FROM THERE I WOULD SAY I JUST

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:23.239
WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER THING I

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.607
ALWAYS WANT TO TRADE THE

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.509
ATTENTION NOT ONLY ON THE

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:27.176
PHYSICAL. HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.811
MENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WE

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:30.813
KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT'S

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.715
HAPPENING HERE AND I THINK THE

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.584
LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.586
ARE GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE-

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.120
FIRST AND FOREMOST BY THE

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.721
INLAND EMPIRE. I'M SO I THINK

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.590
STARTING TO DEVELOP WAYS OF

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.625
TRACKING THAT VERY NEW- BUT

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:46.462
STARTING TO. FORCE FORCE-

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.698
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT IS

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.766
ABSOLUTELY PUT. THANK YOU. THE

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.702
OTHER ABOUT MORE TO BE DONE IN

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:54.504
THE SHORT TERM TO BE.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.606
DESTRUCTIVE DRESS. YEAH I

01:02:56.672 --> 01:03:00.676
THINK- INVESTIGATION OF INJURY

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.745
RATES AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.614
WHERE THESE CASES OF- WITH

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.181
THESE WITH THESE RATES OF

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:06.849
OPERATION PRODUCTION OR COMING

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.885
FROM AND WHY YOU KNOW WHY THEY

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.820
SAID IT IS OUR STANDARD THAT

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.688
STORY'S WORKERS AND SAY YOU

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.256
KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING FOUR

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.891
BOXES PER MINUTE BEFORE AND

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.626
THEN ONE DAY THEY JUST TOLD US

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:18.594
SIX. AND THEY DIDN'T TELL US

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.496
WHY AND IT'S NOT ARBITRARY

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:21.097
THERE'S DEFINITELY RESEARCH

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:22.832
HAPPENING AROUND WHY THEY'RE

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:23.499
DOING THIS IN THERE SAYING THIS

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:26.469
IS HOW FAST WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE-

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.069
IN CERTAIN IN AMAZON THEY HAVE

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:28.871
SOMETHING CALLED THE POWER OUR

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.773
FOR THE BASE TO TAKE AN HOUR

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.575
THEY SAY WHOEVER MOVES THE

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.677
FASTEST THIS HOUR YOU GET A

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.512
FIVE DOLLAR GIFT CARD THE

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.113
PEOPLE THIS RUSH JUST AS FAST

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.848
AS THEY CAN TO YEAH THERE I GOT

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.716
BORED OF DO IT OKAY ALWAYS GOES

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.585
OUT SO I CAN. ANY BASE A TRYING

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.487
TO HELP THEY CAN MOVE THE AND

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.121
HOW FAST THEY CAN PUSH PEOPLE I

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:46.622
THINK THAT'S POINT ABOUT

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:50.426
PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT AS WELL ON

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.027
WE HAD WORKERS TO COME TO SAY

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.530
WHAT'S THE BIG ISSUE HERE LOOK

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:58.601
WORRIED ABOUT ACTED. UPON WAS

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:02.505
THAT. WE'RE SO STRESSED OUT

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:03.139
PEOPLE FREAK OUT BUG OUT IN WE

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.574
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.742
IN WITH NO WE KNOW THERE'S A

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:07.410
LOT OF FISHING ROOM HEALTH VERY

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:08.778
COMPLICATED WE THINK THAT THIS

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.546
IS PUSHING PEOPLE ALL THESE

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.113
DIFFERENT WAYS. SO WE THAT

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.782
THERE TO BE KIND OF COPPER IN

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.450
ELSE BUT I AGAIN WHAT WE SEE

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.452
ENOUGH FROM THE RESEARCH AND

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.521
FROM WORKERS AND STUFF IS PLACE

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.423
OF WORK IS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:20.957
YOU KNOW THE KELLERS SHE'S

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.825
WORKING ON SKINNER YOU KNOW GOT

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.527
IT FOR. FIFTEEN YEARS NOW THERE

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.896
HAS TO BE IN A PLAN TO REBUILD

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.531
LIKE WHAT IS THIS NEW WHERE

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:34.804
WERE THESE YEAH. I WOULD ALSO

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:36.973
AGREE THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.741
MORE MONITORING OF WHAT'S

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.610
HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AND-

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:42.645
YOU KNOW THERE'S- LABOR LAW

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.947
VIOLATIONS IF YOU KNOW HAVE THE

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:46.782
HEALTH AND SAFETY. VIOLATIONS

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.884
BUT ALSO IN. WE HEAR REPORTS TO

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:51.053
ABOUT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.089
IS. ABOUT YOU KNOW INSUFFICIENT

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:54.857
WORK BREAKS AS WELL WHICH I

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.726
THINK IS ALSO RELATED TO. TO

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.594
SOME OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.763
OF. ISSUES THAT. WE WERE

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.765
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER- YOU KNOW

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.767
THAT THE SIZE OF THESE

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.736
FACILITIES IS ENORMOUS RIGHT SO

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:08.638
GETTING TO THE BREAK ROOM. AND

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.873
THE RESTROOMS- ON TOP OF THE

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.507
FACT THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.908
GO THROUGH. THE SECURITY AND

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.977
THAT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.812
THROUGH THE SECURITY TO GET TO

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.614
THE BREAK ROOM. RIGHT AND YEAH

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:20.683
IT TAKES A TOLL. PHYSICALLY AND

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.752
IN TERMS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.620
AS WELL THE JUST THE STRESS

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:26.989
LEVELS- I THINK WHATEVER THE

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:28.691
STATE CAN DO TO. TO KIND OF

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.626
HELP LOW THEY OWN YOU KNOW THE-
