BASED ON OUR PRACTICE ACT

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
WHENEVER A PHYSICAL THERAPIST

FOR THAT EVALUATION.

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:46.283 region:rollup2

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:48.779 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL THERAPIST FOR FORTY

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:50.514 region:rollup2
FIVE DAYS OR TWELVE VISITS.

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.849 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WROTE THAT IN NONE OF US

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:53.250 region:rollup2
WERE CONTEMPLATING WHAT WAS

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:54.952 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THE SCHOOLS FOR

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.321 region:rollup2
OVER THREE DECADES.

00:50:54.952 --> 00:50:58.923 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS

00:50:57.321 --> 00:51:00.291 region:rollup2
BILLS TRIED TO EXEMPT OUT AND

00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.158 region:rollup2
GET THAT SERVICE RIGHT BACK TO

00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:02.726 region:rollup2
WHERE IT WAS PART US MESSING

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:04.562 region:rollup2
AROUND.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:07.331 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER ISSUE AND SO

00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:08.832 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING IN. THAT REALM

00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:09.366 region:rollup2
TODAY WITH HIS EXISTENCE

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.335 region:rollup2
THE PAST THIRTY FIVE OR SO

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:11.936 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:12.703 region:rollup2
WERE ANY PROBLEMS OF EVER COME

00:51:11.936 --> 00:51:15.406 region:rollup2
UP.

00:51:12.703 --> 00:51:16.040 region:rollup2
AND PATIENTS ARE STUDENTS ARE

00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:17.441 region:rollup2
PURPLE THERE FOR WHEN THEY NEED

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.310 region:rollup2
TO BE.

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:20.377 region:rollup2
BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IN THE

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.646 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT UNDER FEDERAL

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:24.114 region:rollup2

LEARNING.

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:28.218 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO AS A

00:51:26.517 --> 00:51:30.621 region:rollup2
HOLD UP IN THE SERVICES THE KIDS

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:32.022 region:rollup2

FULLY? AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

00:51:34.358 --> 00:51:38.162 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW WHAT WERE I THINK

00:51:36.193 --> 00:51:38.762 region:rollup2

WHATEVER THESE NEW ISSUES ARE

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:46.870 region:rollup2

IF IT'S A FEW KIDS AND THEY

00:52:29.847 --> 00:52:33.083 region:rollup2

DIAGNOSIS I WOULD I I DON'T KNOW

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:36.487 region:rollup2
WHY WE WOULD OPPOSE MAKING SURE

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:38.555 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. ARE GOING TO AT LEAST

00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:40.024 region:rollup2

THAT'S LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T

00:52:51.802 --> 00:52:53.470 region:rollup2
SOUND LIKE IT'S EVEN BEEN WORKED

OPPOSE MAKING SURE THERE'S A

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:10.587 region:rollup2

HEALTH AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:08.445 region:rollup2
THEIR KID ACCESSING THE SCHOOL

00:54:07.144 --> 00:54:09.847 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS GENERALLY IN AS FULLY

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.281 region:rollup2
AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

00:54:09.847 --> 00:54:12.182 region:rollup2
IN THE HOPES THAT THEY HAVE OFF

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.618 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS THE FULL

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:17.521 region:rollup2

00:55:47.044 --> 00:55:50.647 region:rollup2
THERE'S PHYSICIANS INVOLVED IN

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:52.216 region:rollup2
CREATION OF THE IEP PHYSICIANS

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.783 region:rollup2
ARE INVOLVED IN PART OF THE TEAM

00:55:52.216 --> 00:55:53.817 region:rollup2
AND SIGNING OFF ON TREATMENT

00:55:52.783 --> 00:55:55.419 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:57.254 region:rollup2
THAT'S GREAT IF WE CAN CRAFT

00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:59.423 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE JUST AND GIVES US

00:55:57.254 --> 00:56:00.057 region:rollup2
COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE'RE NOT.

00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:02.025 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:03.527 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIALLY LIMITING KIDS

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:05.629 region:rollup2
ACCESS AYE PROGRAMS BUT THE SAME

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:06.930 region:rollup2
TIME THERE MAY BE AND I AGREE

00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:09.299 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT MIGHT BE THE

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:11.101 region:rollup2
RAINBOW UNICORN CHILD. BUT THERE

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:12.436 region:rollup2
THEORETICALLY COULD BE A KID

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:14.571 region:rollup2
BASED ON THIS EXEMPTION.

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:15.072 region:rollup2
WHO GOES TO AN IEP PROGRAM WHO

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:17.174 region:rollup2
IS TREATED BY PHYSICAL

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:18.942 region:rollup2
THERAPISTS WHO CAN HOLD A PENCIL

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:20.744 region:rollup2
PROPERLY? PHYSICAL THERAPY

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:22.779 region:rollup2
EXERCISE ON A KID WHO CAN WILL

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:24.748 region:rollup2
PENCIL PROPER PROPERLY IS NOT

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:25.983 region:rollup2
GOING TO HELP THAT CHILD IF THE

00:56:24.748 --> 00:56:27.050 region:rollup2
CHILD IS THE ROCK. OR SOMETHING

00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:28.752 region:rollup2
TO THAT EFFECT.

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:31.355 region:rollup2
THAT THE MANDATORY.

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:32.322 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT PHYSICAL THERAPIST

00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:33.156 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MERELY REFERS

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:34.558 region:rollup2
SOMETHING'S OUTSIDE OF THEIR

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.892 region:rollup2
SCOPE OF PRACTICE.

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:37.394 region:rollup2
IS IS EXCELLENT AND WE

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:39.129 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS BUT

00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:40.731 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A KID THAT

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:42.866 region:rollup2
DOESN'T OF A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.

00:56:40.731 --> 00:56:43.867 region:rollup2
THE KID ISN'T WELL YOU KNOW YOU

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:45.435 region:rollup2
GET IN THAT SITUATION IS IF IT'S

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:48.772 region:rollup2
LATE ONSET SOMETHING WE JUST

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:49.940 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOR

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.908 region:rollup2
SHE WAS EYEBALL.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.742 region:rollup2
AT THAT AND THAT SOUNDS

00:56:50.908 --> 00:56:52.442 region:rollup2
REASONABLE TO ME I'M I ALSO

00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:54.278 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM I HAVE TO

00:56:52.442 --> 00:56:56.113 region:rollup2
STOP THEIR IP.

00:56:54.278 --> 00:56:57.514 region:rollup2
WELL WELL SOMETHING IS PENDING I

00:56:56.113 --> 00:56:59.750 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT

00:56:57.514 --> 00:57:00.817 region:rollup2
AND I'M. VERY SYMPATHETIC TO ARE

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.486 region:rollup2

MONKEY WRENCHES THAT. THIS

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:08.792 region:rollup2
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHERE

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.160 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT YET

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:11.595 region:rollup2
IN FOLKS ARE WORKING HARD ON IT.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.063 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:14.298 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS

00:57:13.063 --> 00:57:15.732 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS MY CHANCE TO SEE

00:57:14.298 --> 00:57:15.932 region:rollup2
IT AND IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:18.135 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:20.237 region:rollup2
.

00:57:18.135 --> 00:57:21.538 region:rollup2

AND.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:28.211 region:rollup2
THINGS AND SO ON WHAT WE'RE

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.680 region:rollup2
GOING TO US IN THE RECENT

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:32.816 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.885 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR. OF JUST LOOK I HEARD

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:36.386 region:rollup2
THE COMMENT ABOUT THAT THE

00:57:34.885 --> 00:57:38.622 region:rollup2
UNICORN RAINBOW CHILD.

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:40.424 region:rollup2
WHOEVER THAT MAY BE THE

00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:41.391 region:rollup2
QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT HOW

00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:43.427 region:rollup2
MANY.

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.961 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEW GAVE A

00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:45.262 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF ABOUT THREE

00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:47.164 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:47.831 region:rollup2
OUT OF THAT THREE PERCENT HOW

00:57:47.164 --> 00:57:51.101 region:rollup2
MANY.

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:52.836 region:rollup2
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE

00:57:51.101 --> 00:57:55.372 region:rollup2
GETTING THROUGH WITHOUT A

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:57.975 region:rollup2
MEETING OF POSITION.

00:57:55.372 --> 00:57:58.842 region:rollup2
OR BEING BEING REVIEW AT I DON'T

00:57:57.975 --> 00:58:00.210 region:rollup2
HAVE A. IT.

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:01.645 region:rollup2
AN ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.080 region:rollup2
SHORT THAT LET ME JUST CLARIFY

00:58:01.645 --> 00:58:05.015 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE POINTS THAT WERE

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.049 region:rollup2
MADE IN CONTEXT OF THAT QUESTION

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:08.251 region:rollup2
IF I MAY NUMBER ONE IS.

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:10.487 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:12.889 region:rollup2
ICD NINE BEING CONVERTED ICD TEN

00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:13.523 region:rollup2
WE'VE GONE FROM. ROUGHLY TEN

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.191 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DIFFERENT COATS TO NOW

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.258 region:rollup2
OVER SIX

00:58:14.191 --> 00:58:17.194 region:rollup2
THE FIVE THOUSAND CODES IS A LOT

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
OF COMEDY IN THE INTO.

00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:21.365 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CODE FOR ABOUT LEFT

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:24.368 region:rollup2
ARM INJURY ORCA.

00:58:21.365 --> 00:58:25.802 region:rollup2
NON ACUTE RIGHT SO THERE'S A

00:58:24.368 --> 00:58:27.337 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS FOR EVERYTHING

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:29.106 region:rollup2
SO THIS CONCEPT OF US MAKING AN

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:30.006 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL DELINEATION BETWEEN

00:58:29.106 --> 00:58:31.908 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING SEEN THE PHYSICIAN

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.409 region:rollup2
VERSUS NOT HAVING A MEDICAL

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS IS THAT IT'S

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:35.645 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL.

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:38.682 region:rollup2
THE KEY IS IS THAT THESE FOLKS

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:40.150 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE SEEN AND THAT. NOT

00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:41.451 region:rollup2
JUST GIVEN THE DIAGNOSIS BUT

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.353 region:rollup2
HAVING A DIAGNOSIS RULED OUT

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.920 region:rollup2
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.155 region:rollup2
I'LL GIVE YOU A STORY ABOUT

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.590 region:rollup2
MYSELF.

00:58:45.155 --> 00:58:47.724 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS SIX SEVEN EIGHT YEARS

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.325 region:rollup2
OLD I WAS NOT PARTICULAR

00:58:47.724 --> 00:58:49.960 region:rollup2
COORDINATED HOW BECAME A HAND

00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:52.429 region:rollup2
SURGEON.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.830 region:rollup2
ANYONE'S GUESS I AM WHEN I RAN.

00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:55.465 region:rollup2
THE OTHER KIDS PARENTS WILL MY

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.033 region:rollup2
MOM ASIDE AND SAID YOU SHOULD

00:58:55.465 --> 00:58:57.134 region:rollup2
GET HIM CHECKED OUT FOR SURE

00:58:56.033 --> 00:58:58.702 region:rollup2
BILL PALSY.

00:58:57.134 --> 00:58:59.603 region:rollup2
NOW LUCKILY MY MOTHER WAS A

00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:00.904 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIAN AND I DIDN'T HAVE

00:58:59.603 --> 00:59:02.072 region:rollup2
CEREBRAL PALSY BUT THAT'S

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:04.608 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE KIND OF KID WE DON'T

00:59:02.072 --> 00:59:05.742 region:rollup2
WANT TO LEAVE.

00:59:04.608 --> 00:59:07.110 region:rollup2
A KID WHO PRESENTS WHAT SOME

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.612 region:rollup2
LACK OF COORDINATION AND THEY'RE

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:09.880 region:rollup2
GETTING TREATMENT.

00:59:08.612 --> 00:59:11.748 region:rollup2
BEFORE EITHER A DIAGNOSIS OR

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.150 region:rollup2
RULE OUT OF DARKNESS.

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:13.717 region:rollup2
I CAN'T GIVE YOU PERCENTAGES BUT

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.887 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO LOSE EVEN ONE OF

00:59:13.717 --> 00:59:18.188 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:19.356 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN IF I MAY HAVE JUST

00:59:18.188 --> 00:59:20.991 region:rollup2
COULD RESPONSE THAT I MEAN IT

00:59:19.356 --> 00:59:22.325 region:rollup2
JUST REMINDED ME HERE THAT. THIS

00:59:20.991 --> 00:59:24.327 region:rollup2
IS GOING ON FOR THIRTY FIVE

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:25.729 region:rollup2
FORTY YEARS PRIOR WE

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:27.764 region:rollup2
INADVERTENTLY CREATIVE PROBLEM

00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:29.633 region:rollup2
IN THE EDUCATIONS.

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:30.567 region:rollup2
FOR KIDS GETTING IP SERVICES AND

00:59:29.633 --> 00:59:32.636 region:rollup2
FOR KIDS GETTING EARLY

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:33.703 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION SERVICES.

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:35.672 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A LEGISLATIVE

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:37.007 region:rollup2
SOLUTION AROUND.

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:39.242 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL THERAPY INTERVENTION

00:59:37.007 --> 00:59:39.810 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME KIND OF

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:41.278 region:rollup2
INJURY AND GO SEEK PHYSICAL

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.546 region:rollup2
THERAPY TREE.

00:59:41.278 --> 00:59:43.680 region:rollup2
NONE OF US CONTEMPLATED THE

00:59:42.546 --> 00:59:44.815 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BASED SERVICES THAT WERE

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.084 region:rollup2
GOING ON AT THAT TIME

00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:48.885 region:rollup2
OR EARLY INTERVENTION.

00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:50.353 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO HISTORY OR EVIDENCE

00:59:48.885 --> 00:59:52.389 region:rollup2
WHATSOEVER.

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:54.257 region:rollup2
OF ANY KIND OF ISSUE OR LACK OF

00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:55.358 region:rollup2
REFERRAL BY PHYSICIANS.

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.793 region:rollup2
WHEN ANY OF THESE KINDS OF KIDS

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:57.360 region:rollup2
COME OUT AND WE'RE BOUND IF YOU

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.428 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE BILL IN FRONT OF

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.629 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.565 region:rollup2
SUBSECTION A ONE WAS JUST

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:03.266 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW.

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:06.102 region:rollup2
BYNES PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO THE

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:07.571 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY MUST REFER

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.839 region:rollup2
IF THEY SEE THINGS AGO OUTSIDE

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:10.140 region:rollup2
THEIR SCOPE WHERE THEY NEED

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:11.908 region:rollup2
FURTHER CONTEMPLATION BY

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.376 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL. THAT EXCEEDS WHAT

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:14.144 region:rollup2
THEY OFFER WAS DIFFERENT FROM

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.579 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY OFFER.

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:16.613 region:rollup2
THIS EXEMPTION THAT WE HAVE DOES

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:18.949 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:20.684 region:rollup2
ALLOW US AN EXEMPTION FROM A ONE

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:22.119 region:rollup2
IT ONLY ALLOWS US AN EXEMPTION

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.520 region:rollup2
FROM A FOR.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:24.721 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE SECTION THAT DEALS

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.022 region:rollup2
WITH THE FORTY FIVE DAY TWELVE

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.290 region:rollup2
DOES IT.

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:29.059 region:rollup2
THINGS WERE WERE LITERALLY

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:30.060 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SATISFY.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.161 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND THE EARLY

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.829 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION SERVICES PROBLEM

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:34.030 region:rollup2
THAT WE CREATED.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.832 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ARE CONTEMPLATING

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.367 region:rollup2
PATIENTS GOING IN AND GETTING

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.668 region:rollup2
HURT PLAYING SOFTBALL OR DOING

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.137 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEY ARE GOING TO SEE A

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.171 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL THERAPIST SO YEARS SO

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.273 region:rollup2
IT'S MEN I MEAN WE HAVE

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:44.708 region:rollup2
LITERALLY IF THIRTY FIVE FORTY

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:46.042 region:rollup2
YEAR TRACK RECORD.

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:48.111 region:rollup2
A PHYSICAL THERAPIST DOING

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:49.779 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT GOES ON IN THE

WHO.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:20.644 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MESS WE WOULD KNOW

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:22.579 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE WE ARE MISSING

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:24.147 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW WE WOULD GET SUED

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:29.452 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE OUR LIABILITY TRACK

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:31.922 region:rollup2

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:44.167 region:rollup2
FEW ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:44.901 region:rollup2
ADMIT THIS POINT A DOCTOR

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:46.102 region:rollup2
ARAMBULA.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:47.504 region:rollup2
.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.805 region:rollup2
I'M CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL AND

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:50.640 region:rollup2
I REALLY FEEL THAT I MUST SHARE

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:52.075 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT FOR THE GOOD OF THIS.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.109 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BUT ALSO FOR THE

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:54.945 region:rollup2
AUTHOR.

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:56.446 region:rollup2
RESPECT THAT YOU BRING THIS BILL

01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.514 region:rollup2
FORWARD YOU IT SEEMS LIKE THE

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:59.249 region:rollup2
SPONSORS ARE REALLY ATTEMPTING

01:01:57.514 --> 01:02:00.684 region:rollup2
TO FIX UP.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:02.252 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT IS BROUGHT FORWARD

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:04.187 region:rollup2
BY THE PASSAGE

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:05.655 region:rollup2
OF AB ONE THOUSAND BUT AB ONE

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:07.524 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IS THE LAW FOR THE

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:10.160 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:12.796 region:rollup2
AND SO I LOOK TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.431 region:rollup2
THE NEXT LAWS WERE PASSING ARE

01:02:12.796 --> 01:02:16.233 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FIXING A.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:18.134 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE IN A CORRECT WAY

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.803 region:rollup2
AND MY COMMENTARY IF I CAN JUST

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.804 region:rollup2
FROM HEARING THE DELIBERATION OF

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.405 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE IS IT'S NOT QUITE

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:23.440 region:rollup2
COOKED YET.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:25.875 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.844 region:rollup2
GET TO A PLACE BUT I FEEL I NEED

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.845 region:rollup2
TO SHARE THE FACT THAT I'M NOT

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.213 region:rollup2
IN A VOTE FOR THIS TODAY NOT

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:31.314 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:33.283 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:35.251 region:rollup2
IT WITHIN HIS HEART TO FIX

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:37.887 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BUT. WE HAVEN'T REACHED

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:39.356 region:rollup2
AN END POINT THAT NEEDS ALL OF

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:42.258 region:rollup2
OUR NEEDS AND.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:43.860 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M HEARING IS?

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.394 region:rollup2
THE SUPPORTERS SAY THEY BATTED

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.695 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND FOR THIRTY FIVE

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:47.264 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.898 region:rollup2
AND I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.734 region:rollup2
ON ITS FACE.

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:52.702 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE GONE EVERY ISSUE

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:55.405 region:rollup2
ALWAYS PERFECT.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:58.308 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WONDER IS WHAT ROLE

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:59.843 region:rollup2
WE S.. CAN PLAY IN.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:01.378 region:rollup2
IN THIS INTERFACE IN IS THERE AN

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:03.179 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:05.515 region:rollup2
TO BE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT FROM

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:07.717 region:rollup2
PLACE TO HELP TO MAKE SURE.

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:10.086 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE CATCHING EVERYTHING.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:11.221 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:13.423 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR PHYSICAL THERAPIST

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:15.225 region:rollup2
TO DO THEIR JOB WELL.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'VE DONE IT WELL.

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:17.327 region:rollup2
BUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:19.162 region:rollup2
HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT.

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:21.097 region:rollup2
AND.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:23.333 region:rollup2
I.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:25.502 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO ADD MY TWO CENTS

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:28.338 region:rollup2
IN MY COMMENTS FOR WHERE I AM

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:30.807 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET THIS

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:32.275 region:rollup2
BILL TO A PLACE WITH AMENDMENTS.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.910 region:rollup2
I CAN SEE MYSELF VOTING FOR THIS

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.978 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.880 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:38.114 region:rollup2
CONTINUE DIALOGUE AND WOULD LIKE

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.716 region:rollup2

THERE IS A.

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:59.202 region:rollup2
SORT OF A DISCONNECT ON IN TERMS

01:03:56.933 --> 01:04:00.904 region:rollup2
OF HOW. WE'RE OPERATING UNDER

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.339 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAWS AND THEN OF COURSE

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:03.606 region:rollup2
UNDER OUR STATE LOSS TO TRY TO

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:06.009 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE NEEDS.

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:07.043 region:rollup2
OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WE ARE

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.445 region:rollup2
TRYING HARD TO MAKE SURE DO NOT

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:09.946 region:rollup2
FALL.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.980 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE CRACKS IN THAT THEY

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:13.116 region:rollup2
ARE ABLE TO GET. A PROPER

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:15.318 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:17.220 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO THIS

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:18.488 region:rollup2
POINT. WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.123 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:22.092 region:rollup2
AND WITH THOSE WHO WERE IN

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:22.959 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION ONE PARTY HAS REMOVED

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.494 region:rollup2
THEIR OPPOSITION ALTHOUGH

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:26.663 region:rollup2

TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:38.074 region:rollup2

REALLY TAKE SOME CORRECTIVE.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:49.252 region:rollup2
ACTIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:51.488 region:rollup2
SHARPEN. OF THE POINTS THAT I

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:52.655 region:rollup2
THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE MADE AND TO

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:53.656 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ISSUES TO THE BEST

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:55.592 region:rollup2

CONTINUE TO. OF FIND WAYS THAT.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:04.501 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF REFERRALS AND

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.936 region:rollup2
GRAMMY.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:08.972 region:rollup2
EXPANDING OR INCLUDING AS MANY

VOICES.

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:13.576 region:rollup2
AND THE TRIALS OF DEVELOPMENT

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:15.111 region:rollup2
ARE CAN BE MADE AS POSSIBLE.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.679 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO WERE OPERATING

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:19.382 region:rollup2
UNDER.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:20.583 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LIMITATIONS THAT ALLOWS.

TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THESE

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:20.296 region:rollup2
TESTS SINCE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES

PRACTICE THE SKILLS THAT THEY

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.709 region:rollup2

TECHNOLOGISTS IN THIS STATE OVER

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.930 region:rollup2
A DECADE AGO. OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:03.532 region:rollup2
WISELY PASSED

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.867 region:rollup2
A LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:06.902 region:rollup2
FOR A SECONDARY CATEGORY OF

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:08.404 region:rollup2
LICENSURE FOR OUR LABORATORIES

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:10.572 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE MLP. A LICENSING

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:12.274 region:rollup2
CATEGORY UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:14.009 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE OF THEIR

SCOPE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE IN

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:17.680 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATION HAS LED TO A

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:19.915 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH LABORATORIES BEING

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.316 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HIRE. AND RETAIN THESE

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:22.751 region:rollup2
ARE INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:24.553 region:rollup2
LABORATORIES ARE JUST

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:26.355 region:rollup2
TOO MANY LARGE VOLUME TESTS THAT

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:26.822 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:27.923 region:rollup2

AND WE ARE NOW TURNING OUT AND

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:40.102 region:rollup2
THEY'LL TEASE. MOST OF THOSE ARE

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:41.870 region:rollup2
GOING OUT OF STATE TO PRACTICE

01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:43.105 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:44.807 region:rollup2

STAFF FOR. BEING OPEN TO MEETING

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:25.541 region:rollup2
WITH US IN HEARING OUR CONCERNS

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:27.576 region:rollup2
I'M WE FEEL THAT BLOOD SMEARS

01:22:25.541 --> 01:22:29.711 region:rollup2
URINALYSIS IN HBO ARE EACH

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:31.780 region:rollup2
TESTING. WHICH ARE ALL COMPLEX

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:33.582 region:rollup2
OR MODERATELY COMPLEX INVOLVE A

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.583 region:rollup2
DISCRETIONARY COMPONENT MEANING

01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:36.685 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR BEST LEFT IN THE

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:38.487 region:rollup2
HANDS OF CLINICAL LAB SCIENTIST

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:40.088 region:rollup2
YOU ARE BETTER TRAINED AND

EDUCATED TO PERFORM THEM.

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:44.193 region:rollup2
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:46.462 region:rollup2
CREATES POTENTIAL ON PATIENT

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:48.263 region:rollup2
HEALTH RISKS AS BLOOD SMEARS ARE

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.465 region:rollup2
USED IN THE DIAGNOSIS. UP

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:51.066 region:rollup2
SERIOUS CONDITIONS SUCH AS

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:53.402 region:rollup2
LYMPHOMA AND LEUKEMIA AND THEN

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:55.337 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A FAULTY BLOOD

01:22:53.402 --> 01:22:57.973 region:rollup2
TRANSFUSION AND WOOD. COULD BE

01:22:55.337 --> 01:23:01.276 region:rollup2
DEADLY I'M WE WE DO AGREE

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:05.047 region:rollup2
I SPEAKING ABOUT WE WE THINK

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.281 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE A SHORTAGE OF

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:06.815 region:rollup2

STATE.

01:23:08.617 --> 01:23:12.187 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE THINK THAT WE NEED

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.655 region:rollup2
MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS NOT TO

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:15.757 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME OF THAT THAT.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.992 region:rollup2
.

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:18.527 region:rollup2

MEDICAL LAB TAX.

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:24.032 region:rollup2
ON WE DON'T THINK THAT MEDICAL
