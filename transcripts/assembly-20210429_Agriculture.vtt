THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.001

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.702
CHOICES BETWEEN WHICH PATIENTS

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.371

RAN A REGULATED THE STATE OF

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.106
NEW YORK'S BLOOD SUPPLY. AT THE

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.408
TIME OF THE AIDS CRISIS I WAS

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.776
WELL AWARE AT THAT TIME THAT WE

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.344
NEED TO HAVE SIMILAR BLOOD

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.779
BANKS FOR ANIMALS THAT TOOK

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.582
INTO CONSIDERATION. THE HEALTH.

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.283
AND THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF THE

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.352
DONORS BUT ALSO OF THE

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:32.255
RECIPIENTS. IN ADDITION TO OUR

00:56:32.322 --> 00:56:35.525
WRITTEN. TESTIMONY ABOUT AB ONE

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:37.060
TWO EIGHT TWO- WHERE WE NEED TO

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:38.394
HAVE ANIMALS OF A PARTICULAR

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:42.565
SIZE A PARTICULAR- AGE AND ALSO

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.868
TRACTABLE. COMMUNITY DONORS

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:47.337
OKAY THAT'S CLEAR. BUT MOST

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:49.205
IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO DEAL

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:52.008
WITH THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.676
POTENTIAL OF THESE COMMUNITY

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:55.912
DONORS. SO EVEN THOUGH THESE

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:58.114
ANIMALS MAY BE HEALTHY AND MAY

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.983
BE SCREENED OCCASIONALLY FOR

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:01.417
INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT COULD

00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.086
BE TRANSMITTED BY BLOOD. THEY

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.088
NEED TO BE TESTED THE BLOOD

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.356
FROM THOSE ANIMALS NEEDS TO BE

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:08.391
TESTED EVERY TIME THEY PROVIDE

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.661
A DONATION WHETHER IT BE TWO

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:12.228
THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR.

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.330
THAT'S BECAUSE HEALTHY ANIMALS

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.633
CAN CARRY INFECTIOUS VIRUSES

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:20.203
FOR EXAMPLE. DEBILITATED OR ILL

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.372
PATIENT COULD SUCCUMB TO SHOULD

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:25.375
THEY BE TRANSMITTED INCLUDING

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:25.909
THINGS LIKE EVEN HEARTWORM

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.777
DISEASE. SO WE NEED TO MAKE

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.646
SURE THAT THE BLOOD IS CHECKED

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:38.488
THAT THE DON'T RESPECT. THEY

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:40.156
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.939
BEHALF OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK-

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.775
THE OTHER BLOOD BANK LICENSED

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:34.777
IN CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE BLOOD.

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.345
WHITE THE PROPONENTS AND OUR

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.414
FELLOW BLOOD BANK WE SHARE THE

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.917
GOAL OF OPENING UP THE MARKET

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.752
TO COMMUNITY BLOOD FOR AS LONG

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.387
AS THERE HAVE BEEN BLOOD BANKS

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:46.389
THE DEMAND FOR BLOOD HAS

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.658
EXCEEDED THE SUPPLY- THAT HAS

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.293
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COLONY

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.728
BLOOD BANK- MODEL IN FACT

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:54.130
CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.431
QUALITY AND MOST ABUNDANT

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.033
SUPPLY OF BLOOD ANYWHERE ON THE

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.669
PLANET. AND IT'S BECAUSE OF-

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.037
THE LICENSING AND REGULATIONS

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.639
THAT EXIST NONETHELESS WE ARE

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:04.507
SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL OF THE

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.943
BILL WE DO HAVE TWO CONCERNS

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.544
THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THEIR

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.646
BOTH RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THE

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.548
FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.350
TRIGGER WHEN YOU WOULD BEGIN TO

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:17.820
WIND DOWN PROCESS OF COLONY

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.088
BASED PRODUCTION- AS THE BILL

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.390
IS. DRAFTED BAPTIST NUMBER SO

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:22.825
WHETHER IT BE ONE TEN OR A

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.660
HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW- IF

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:27.697
COMMUNITY BLOOD HITS THAT

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.999
TRIGGER AMOUNT- WHICH WOULD AT

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.434
THAT POINT ONLY BE HALF OF THE

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.269
TOTAL BLOOD IN THE MARKET. THE

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:34.837
TRIGGER LANGUAGE WOULD HAVE

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.906
QUALITY BASED PRODUCTION AND

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.741
TWELVE MONTHS LATER- THAT'S A

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.776
RECIPE FOR DISASTER WE THINK

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.945
THAT THE TRIGGER AMOUNT NEEDS

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:45.548
TO BE A DYNAMIC NUMBER- BASED

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.350
ON A ROLLING AVERAGE OF PRIOR

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:49.518
YEARS. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.621
ONCE THE TRIGGER IS PULLED THAT

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.755
THE RAMP DOWN NEEDS TO BE

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:56.626
GRADUAL AND NOT- MEDIA. SO THAT

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:57.727
THERE'S A CHANCE FOR COMMUNITY

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.495
BLOOD PRODUCTION TO GROW TO

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.430
REPLACE THE REDUCTION. THE

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.532
OTHER ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.067
STANDARDS FOR PRODUCING FAKE

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:08.404
BLOOD AND- WE SEE NO REASON TO

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:11.173
REFERENCE AB H. TM- WE HAVE

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.241
AGREED TO THE EXISTING

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.876
CONSENSUS STATEMENT BUT THE

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.211
FACT IS IF YOU'RE FINDING A

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.412
POSITION THAT THE VETERINARY

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:17.980
MEDICAL BOARD TO ESTABLISH BEST

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:20.683
PRACTICES. THAT PERSON CAN LOOK

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.952
AT WHATEVER'S AVAILABLE AND

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.687
MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.355
BEST PRACTICES THE STATE OUGHT

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:28.257
NOT TO BE DELEGATING AUTHORITY

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:31.027
OVER- BLOOD BANKING PRACTICES

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.028

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AS LONG

01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:32.501
AS IT'S AN ACCURATE DEPICTION

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:34.670
OF WHAT'S TRANSPIRED HERE THAT

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:35.938
THERE WAS A PREVIOUS VERSIONS

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.040
THIS BILL THAT WENT FURTHER

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:38.974
INTO MARCH IS BANNING THE

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.745
PRACTICE IS THAT RIGHT NOW WAS

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:43.279
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR OR

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.681
UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. I

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:47.483
DON'T WANT TO MISREPRESENT THE

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:52.855
DETAILS OF THAT BILL- BUT I

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:54.056
OKAY WELL THAT I BELIEVE THE

01:09:54.123 --> 01:09:55.457
VERSION THAT WENT TO THE

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:56.825
GOVERNOR'S DESK DID AND THE

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:59.028
GOVERNOR IN HIS VETO MESSAGE

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.162
SUPPORTED THE INTENTION OF THAT

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:03.732
BILL- WHILE THE DOING IT. SO I

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:05.201
GUESS WHAT OCCURS TO ME IS THAT

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.936
THE FINAL ISSUE HERE THERE ARE

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:07.636
ISSUES THAT THERE IS

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.172
FACILITIES- WE HAVE SOME

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:13.475
WITNESSES HERE TODAY SUGGESTING

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.977
THAT THESE FACILITIES ARE- LESS

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.713
THAN APPROPRIATE OR UNSAFE FOR.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.182
OR HAVE SOME POOR TREATMENT. OF

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:20.649
THE ANIMALS IN THOSE

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.518
FACILITIES. I DON'T HAVE FIRST

01:10:22.585 --> 01:10:24.186
HAND KNOWLEDGE. THAT THAT'S

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.155
TRUE OR NOT TRUE- BUT THAT'S

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:29.458
CERTAINLY THE ASSERTION. CALL

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:32.328
PLEASE HANG UP AND TRY AGAIN.

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:35.764
MISTER BLOOM BETTER WITH. THAT

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:39.234
WAS DIRECTED AT YOU SIR SHOULD.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:42.037
AND THE- I GUESS CHRISTMAS WHAT

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.872
DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME IS IF

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.040
WE'RE GOING TO DO THESE KIND OF

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.609
COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS OPERATED

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.510
BY YOUR LOCAL VETERINARIANS.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.012
WHICH DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.314
REASONABLE SOLUTION THEN MOVING

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.250
FORWARD WITH AUTHORIZING THAT

01:10:54.316 --> 01:10:56.619
ACTIVITY AND ALLOWING THOSE

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:59.021
COMMITTEE BLOOD TO. OCCUR AND

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.022
THEN HOPEFULLY GROW RIGHT

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.624
BECAUSE I AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:02.358
THE ONE OF THE REASONS THE

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.759
GOVERNOR VETOED THE ORIGINAL

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.995
PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.997
THERE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:09.164
IF WE MOVED TO COMMITTEE BLOOD

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.833
BANKS WITHOUT THESE FACILITIES

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:14.103
THAT THERE MIGHT BE. A SHORTAGE

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.004
OF SUPPLY- I THINK THAT'S

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.606
EVERYONE'S CONCERN OBVIOUSLY WE

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:20.109
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SHORTAGE

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:22.244
OF BLOOD AND THAT'S WHY-

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.213
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS BROUGHT

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.981
UP THE ISSUE OF WHAT THE-

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.783
TRIGGERS WOULD BE AND THAT IS

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.852
ISSUE IS. CONTINUING TO BE

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.620
UNDER DISCUSSION OF LANGUAGE IN

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.756
THE BILL AND OUT ITALY WILL BE

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.958
MODIFIED AND- HOPEFULLY IN

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:37.393
KEEPING WITH A CONSENSUS THAT

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:40.362
CAN BE. REACHED ON- WHAT ARE

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:42.498
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:44.299
WE CAN TRANSITION OUT OF THE-

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.902
CURRENT LARGELY CLOSE TO

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.139
QUALITY SYSTEM. TO THE

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.074
COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK A MODEL.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.976
WHY IS THAT NO GETS RIGHT TO

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:54.843
THE HEART OF THE ISSUE FOR ME

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.512
IS I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:57.913
WE HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.983
VERSION OF THE BILL- TRIGGERS

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.219
AND- AUTHORIZATION. TO SHUT

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:06.055
DOWN THESE FACILITIES RATHER

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:06.955
THAN APPROACHING THE PROBLEM

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.224
FROM LET'S CREATE THE

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.459
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:13.595
BLOOD BANKS. LET'S TAKE THE

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.731
PROPER STEPS TO- YOU KNOW GET

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.666
PUBLICITY AND SUPPORT TO THOSE

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.334
EFFORTS IN THE HOPES THAT

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.503
PEOPLE WILL UTILIZE THEM. AND

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:22.671
THAT THOSE WILL BECOME SELF

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.406
SUSTAINING WON'T NEED THESE

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:25.107
OTHER SELLERS THAT'LL MAKE

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.676
SENSE. THEN IN A SUBSEQUENT

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.378
SESSION IF WE WANT TO COME BACK

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:30.779
AND LOOK AT PHASING OUT THOSE

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.147
FACILITIES THAT SEEMS LIKE AN

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:33.282
APPROPRIATE QUESTION AT THAT

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:35.417
TIME. BUT TO DO IT HERE IN THE

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:38.821
WAY- WERE KIND OF POINTING. OUT

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.289
TO THE AGENCIES AND- AND

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.490
SENDING ALL THIS WITHOUT HAVING

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:42.758
ALL THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.026
US BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW YOU

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.494
HADN'T HAVE INCLUDING YOUR BILL

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.628
COLLECTION OF QUITE A BIT OF

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:47.763
INFORMATION THAT SEEMS

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.999
APPROPRIATE AND HELPFUL- SO I

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.267
GUESS. WHAT I'M DRIVING AT HERE

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:56.271
IS IF YOU WERE TO REMOVE THE-

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.073
WHAT WHAT WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.776
THE PREMATURE- ELIMINATION OF

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.277
THESE FACILITIES FROM THE BILL

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.947
AND JUST FOCUS ON THE COMMITTEE

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.616
BLOOD BANKS AND THE- REPORTING

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.051
REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAKE A TON

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.953
OF SENSE. I FEEL LIKE I COULD

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.421
SUPPORT THE BILL BUT WITH THE

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.790
OTHER PROVISION IN THERE- IT

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:18.060
LEAVES ME WITH SOME CONCERN-

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:18.761
REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:21.430
BLOOD SUPPLY AND YOU KNOW IT.

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.766
REMINDS ME OF WHAT CENTER RIGHT

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.000
RIGHT USED TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.469
LOOKING AT A BILL THE FIRST

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.537
QUESTION IS THERE A PROBLEM.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:31.106
WELL I WOULD ARGUE MAYBE MAYBE

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:31.707
THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE I'M NOT

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:34.009
TOTALLY CONVINCED. DOES THIS

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.511
LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF US

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.279
OFFER A SOLUTION. I THINK

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:38.881
PARTIALLY IT OFFERS A SOLUTION

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:40.415
CERTAINLY SETS SOME OF THE

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:41.683
PIECES IN PLACE AND THEN THE

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.452
THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION IS A

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:43.952
SOLUTION WORSE THAN THE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.989
ORIGINAL PROBLEM. AND THE

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:48.757
JURY'S OUT ON THAT IF WE'RE

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.259
GOING TO INCLUDE- THIS

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:53.996
PROVISION. TO DISCONTINUE THESE

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:57.900
FACILITIES- PREMATURELY- SO

01:13:57.966 --> 01:13:58.534
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE AN

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.970
AMENDMENT TO. TAKE THAT OUT-

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.505
WORK ON THESE OTHER PIECES NO

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:05.941
WE WOULD NOT AND TO- THE REASON

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:08.177
FOR THAT IS THAT- THE BILL IS

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:11.213
FOCUSED ON TWO GOALS- ONE GOAL

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.450
IS TO SHIFT TO A MORE HUMANE-

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:18.787
BLOOD. DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT TO

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.924
OF- AT THAT IS THE COMMUNITY

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.660
BLOOD DONOR MODEL- AT THE SAME

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:27.696
TIME IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:28.697
CURRENT SYSTEM THE CLOSE

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:33.101
QUALITY MODEL- IS. A FAR LESS

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:35.237
THAN IDEAL FOR THE ANIMALS WHO

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.939
WERE INVOLVED AND SO THE

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:38.473
IMPORTANCE OF SHIFTING OUT OF

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.042
THAT MODEL UNDER THE PROPER

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.643
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S WHY

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:42.644
THERE IS DETAIL IN THE BILL

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.780
THAT. LAYS OUT WHAT THOSE

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.148
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE AND

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:48.550
THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING GUN-

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:50.252
IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE- THAT

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.387
THE TRIGGER LANGUAGE THAT'S WHY

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:53.889
THAT PART OF THE BILLS IN THERE

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.757
BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AND THE

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.860
BILL RECOGNIZES IT'S IMPORTANT

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:59.661
TO ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE GOALS

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.864
NOT JUST ONE IF WE- WEEK. DO

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.332
KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN PRIOR

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.367
VERSIONS OF THIS BILL- THAT

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:08.170
WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL THAT- THAT

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:11.206
DID SPLIT OFF THESE ISSUES- BUT

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.941
BY SPLITTING OFF THE ISSUE

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:16.144
YOU'RE REALLY DELAYING- AN

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.580
ISSUE REGARDING THE WELL BEING

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.949
AND THE HEALTH. OF FOLK OF

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.985
THESE ANIMALS. IN THE CLOSE

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.720
CALL IN THE SYSTEM I UNDERSTAND

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:25.988
THERE WAS TESTIMONY THAT

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.923
THERE'S NO PROBLEM THERE BUT

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.992
THERE'S NO DENYING THE FACT

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:30.559
THAT THE CLOSE CALL IN THE

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:34.196
SYSTEM. REQUIRES DOGS TO BE

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:36.598
KEPT IN CONFINEMENT- ON

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.367
PREMISES THAT'S THE WAY THE

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.035
SYSTEM WORKS AND WE WANT TO

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:41.703
MOVE AWAY FROM THAT MODEL AT

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.171
THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME AND

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.806
NOT PUT THAT OFF TO SOME-

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:48.977
DISTANT DATE. IN THE FUTURE

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:49.745
THAT'S ON CERTAIN. SHE THAT

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:50.779
INFORMATION HAVE VISIT THE CALL

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.381
TO. ARE AND THE PAPERS THAT I

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:56.752
HAVE NOT YOU HAVE NOT. BUT WE

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.053
KNOW WHAT THE FACT YOU KNOW

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.488
THERE THERE IS DISAGREEMENT

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:02.791
OVER. WHETHER DOGS ARE TREATED

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.760
HUMANELY ARE NOT ON PROMISES

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:06.662
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT SYSTEM

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:09.164
AND IS IRREFUTABLE IS THAT DOGS

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.800
ARE KEPT IN CAPTIVITY FOR YEARS

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:15.270
ON END. THAT'S THE PART OF THE

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:15.871
SYSTEM THAT IS MOST CRUCIAL TO

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:21.209
ADD. I'M NOT SURE WERE ARE. ONE

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:22.277
HUNDRED PERCENT- IN AGREEMENT

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.612
THERE BUT- IF YOU'RE NOT

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:24.613
WILLING TO TAKE THE MEMBER I

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.447
DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:27.115
SUPPORTING- THE BILL THIS

TRUST IN YOU AS A COLLEAGUE AND

01:16:32.654 --> 01:16:34.656
KNOW THAT YOU DO GOOD WORK BUT

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:37.192
THE- UNFORTUNATE BAD HABIT THIS

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.194
INSTITUTION. HAS DEVELOPED IN

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.530
RECENT YEARS AS WE- OPERATE A

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:42.731
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH LIKE A BILL

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.666
FACTORY JUST MOVE BILLS ALONG

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.068
ONE WE'VE IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:46.635
WE DON'T RESOLVE THEM WHEN

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.503
THEY'RE IN FRONT OF US I AM IN

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:49.838

ADVANTAGE TO MOVE IT TO THE

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.615
NEXT STEP- RATHER THAN FACE THE

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:01.850
MUSIC IN A PARTICULAR COMMITTEE

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.819

PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF YOUR BILL

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:29.077
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNED WITH-

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.446

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.181
MUCH FURTHER IN ACKNOWLEDGING

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.449

TALK ABOUT THE TRIGGER IS THAT

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.590
ONE HALF THE SUPPLY. IS

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:44.326
FURNISHED BY THESE COMMUNITY-

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:46.728

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.163
START AND I YOU KNOW I'M JUST

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.898

ACTUAL TRIGGER IS IT LIKE THAT

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:52.367
