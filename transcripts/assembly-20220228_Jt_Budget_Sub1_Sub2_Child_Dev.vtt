00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:43.314
MUCH LARGER. AND I CAN TELL YOU

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.049
AS A AS A SUB DURING THE FALL

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:48.252
AND MANY COULD RUN A SCHOOL- FOR

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.787
BEING QUARANTINED EXETER. MANY

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.021
OTHER CLASSES OR MAYBE TWENTY

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:52.156
TWO KIDS IN THE TELL YOU THAT

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.758
SETS A DIFFERENT TONE.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.459
ESPECIALLY AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.862
LEVEL WHERE I WAS. SO I HOPE

00:39:57.928 --> 00:40:00.030
THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CAN

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:03.934
PRY PRIORITIZE- CLASS SIZE

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.803
REDUCTION COUNSELORS- IN AND

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.405
ENABLING DISTRICTS TO. TACKLE

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:09.874
THE NEEDS THAT ARE IN THEIR

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.641
DISTRICT BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE

00:40:10.708 --> 00:40:12.676
ONE UNIFORM. CHALLENGE ACROSS

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.412
THE STATE. AND I LOOK OF IF I

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.313
LOOK AT THE PROPOSED BUDGET THAT

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.848
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IT THERE'S A

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.818
SMALL AD ON CALL A FIVE POINT

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.186
THREE THREE PERCENT. YET FOR

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.487
DISTRICTS JUST TO TASTE STATIC

00:40:23.554 --> 00:40:26.757
WITH EXPENSES CPI IS AT SEVEN

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.959
POINT 5% RIGHT. PERSON STIRS

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:32.129
AVERAGE ABOUT BY TWO POINT 35%

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:33.063
AND THERE'S ABOUT 4% OTHER

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.065
COSTS. THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SCHOOL

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:36.801
DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART OF THE

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:39.603
CPI THAT THEY'RE GOING TO- THAT

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.571
THEY ARE FACING SOTHAT'S AT

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:42.173
WORK THIRTEEN POINT EIGHTY FIVE

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.708
PER. THIRTEEN POINT 85% JUST FOR

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.143
DISTRICTS TO SAY STATIC. I'M

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.245
WITH LAST YEAR YEAH WE'VE GOT A

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:50.181
PROPOSED COLA IN THE BUDGET ONLY

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:52.516
OF ONLY FIVE POINT 33% OF WE

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:53.651
WANT DISTRICTS TO LOWER CLASS

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.352
SIZES. WHICH I THINK IS A NO

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:56.954
BRAINER FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.289
BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO STUDENT

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.424
HEALTH. IT ALSO SPEAKS TO

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.792
TEACHER HEALTH. YOU WANT TO

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.728
RECRUIT. MORE TEACHERS IN THE

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:05.729
CLASSROOM YOU WANT TEACHERS TO

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.898
STAY HEALTHY. LOWER THE NUMBER

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:09.233
OF CLIENTS THEY HAVE FOR LACK OF

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.936
A BETTER WORD HEY LIGHTEN THE

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.304
CASELOADS THAT CAN REALLY GET TO

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.705
KNOW THEIR STUDENTS AND REALLY

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.140
ADDRESS OUR ECONOMIC ACADEMIC

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:18.843
NEEDS. BUT ALSO YOUR SOCIAL AND

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:21.278
EMOTIONAL HEALTH NEEDS SO I HOPE

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.546
GOING FORWARD YOU CAN I CAN YOU

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:24.415
AND I CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:26.250
CONVERSATIONS AS THE BUDGET

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:27.484
MOVES DOWN THE LINE FOR THIS

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.687
YEAR WE CONTINUE CAN CONTINUE

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:32.523
TO- TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.725
TO. TO MEET LOCAL DISTRICTS NEED

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:37.061
SENT TO ME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.762
THAT CERTAINLY MEANS. ADDING ON

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.065
TO THE BASE ALLOCATION A GOOD A

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.366
GOOD AMOUNT HEALTHY AMOUNTS OF

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:43.434
THE DISTRICTS WILL HAVE THE

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.936
FUNDS THE REVENUE. THEY NEED TO

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.071
LOWER CLASS SIZES TO HIRE

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.939
COUNSELORS AND TACKLE SOME OF

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:49.573
THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT OUR

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.243
SCHOOL SITES SO WITH THAT ALL

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.710

APPRECIATE YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.048
COMMENTS TONIGHT I WAS THINKING

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:59.216
THAT THERE'S A TIME WHEN WE

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.417
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TWENTY

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.152
TWO STUDENTS WAS ACTUALLY. WAS A

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.387
SMALL CLASS SIZE AND UNDER THE

00:42:03.454 --> 00:42:05.022
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE EXPERIENCE

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:07.057
THE INTENSITY THAT WE EXPERIENCE

00:42:07.124 --> 00:42:08.626
WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.560
STUDENTSNEED A LOT MORE

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:11.061
INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT. A ONE TO ONE

00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:13.464
SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC-

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.499
IT'S SAD TO SEE TO NOTE THE

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.601
NUMBER OF- YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.470
GONE TO A HOSPITALIZATION FOR

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.839
EMERGENCIES IT'S UP IT'S UP SOME

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.307
42% FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE

00:42:23.374 --> 00:42:24.875
AGES OF THIRTEEN AND TWENTY ONE

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.443
SO. IT'S VERY MUCH WITHIN THAT

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.545
AGE RANGE AND GRADE SPAN THAT

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:30.047
YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS A

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.949
MIDDLE SCHOOL IN OF WHAT WE DO

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:33.550
AROUND HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:34.685
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE WORKFORCE

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.987
CHALLENGES ARE SIGNIFICANT WEVE

00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.422
EXPERIENCED THEM. THIS WHAT THIS

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:39.924
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN GENEROUS IN

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.926
SAYING THAT THEY CAN BE A NURSE

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.361
CONSULTANT AND WE CAN BUILD A

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:44.995
SMALL HELP OFFICE AT THE

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.397
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HEY

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:47.932
WE'RE FINDING TO THAT IT IS

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:48.766
DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT THESE

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.467
POSITIONS AND THAT WE HAVE TO

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:52.836
HAVE VERY- LIKE OUR SCHOOLS WE

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:53.304
HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.672
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.607
COMPENSATION AND TRAINING AND

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:57.875
BUILDING A PATHWAY TO BUILD THAT

00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.410
THAT WORKFORCE AND OF COURSE

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:01.011
HAVING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.379
WHETHER IT'S ADDED TO THE BASE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.781
OR RECOGNIZING THE COST OF

00:43:03.847 --> 00:43:05.616
EDUCATION ALL THESE THINGS WILL.

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:07.251
HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO THAT

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.452
BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:09.286
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:12.923
WITH- AS WE SPEAK AND- WE'VE

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.491
CREATED A WORK FORCE ON A WORK

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.560
GROUP THAT'S FOCUS ON- HOW TO

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:18.062
ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.263
WORKING WITH A LOT OF PARTNERS

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.297
IN THE FIRST THING THAT COMES

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.533
UP. IS COMPENSATION- THE AND WE

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:24.401
LOOK AT THE DATA TO SEE WHERE

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:26.870
PEOPLE- HAVE LEFT JOBS IN OUR

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:28.405
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND THEY'VE

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.207
LEFT AND THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.575
AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL KINDS

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:33.477
OF CONVERSATION. CLASS SIZE HAS

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.112
TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:39.817
IT CERTAINLY TO REVENUE TO HELP. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCREASE

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:42.219
COP AND A- TRAINING PRO. WILL BE

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.020

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:58.635
WE OFTEN ALIGN OUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:48:58.702 --> 00:48:59.936
PROGRAMS WITH SOME OF THE

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:01.104
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TO SERVE

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.674
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND-

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.242
THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT AREA

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.410
GOING BACK TO THE START OF THE

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:08.445
PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT. SPECIAL

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:09.613
EDUCATION WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.248
DELIVERED TO DISTRICTS LEARNING

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.816
AND SO THAT MEANT A LOT OF

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:13.417
FAMILIES COULDN'T GET

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:14.818
ASSESSMENTS AND THINGS THAT THEY

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.820
NEEDED VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:17.587
AGAIN I WANT TO COMMEND THE

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.056
EDUCATORS AND THE FAMILIES AND

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:19.623
THE STUDENTS FOR THEIR

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.758
RESILIENCE. AND AS YOU POINT OUT

00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:23.527
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE

00:49:23.593 --> 00:49:25.462
SEEN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITS

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:28.231
IN- OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AS A

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:32.135
STATE- SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS ONE

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:34.071
ONE AIDES IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:35.572
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT OFTEN WHY

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.007
PEOPLE LEAVE THE FIELD IS

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.508
WORKING CONDITIONS. ARE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.543
EDUCATORS WERE READY

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.078
EXPERIENCING THE MOST DIFFICULT

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.846
WORKING CONDITIONS EVEN BEFORE

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.781
THE PANDEMIC AND SO IF WE'RE

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.717
GOING TO FIND WAYS TO HAVE THE

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.751
SPEECH PATHOLOGIST IN THE ONE

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.519

NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS WE ARE

00:49:53.323 --> 00:49:55.158
GOING TO HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.793
ABOUT TRAINING AND COMPENSATION

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.495
IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS.

00:49:58.562 --> 00:50:00.297
LOWERING CASELOADS I THINK YOUR

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.399
YOUR POINT SIR- VERY SIMILAR TO

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:03.467
THE POINTS THAT WE HEARD FROM

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:05.235
COLLEAGUES OF LONG BEACH YOU

EDUCATION AND IT IS SO

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:17.881
DIFFICULT. IT IS THE COMBINATION

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:20.283
OF THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDS OF

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.118
STUDENTS WITH THE LACK OF THE

SUPPORT- THAT ARE OFTEN NEEDED

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:25.188
AND THE LITIGIOUS NATURE THAT

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:27.023
MANY OF OUR- DISTRICTS HAVE

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:28.392
TAKEN OFF AND MANY OF OUR

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:29.926
DISTRICTS HAVE STARTED TO JUST

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:32.129
SAY NO TO SERVICES BECAUSE OF

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:34.898
COST. YEAH AND- YOU KNOW I'M I'M

BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:40.203
HAVE TO DO WHAT'S IN THE

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.304

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.328
SHE WAS A HEALTH CARE

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:22.331
ASSISTANCE- AND NURSED- BUT YOU

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:24.066

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.801
A VOLUNTEER IN THE CLASSROOM SHE

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:27.569
WAS A VOLUNTEER MY CLASSROOM AND

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.238
NOT OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER TO

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.906
WORK FOR A DISTRICT TO BE WITH

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.508

AND WE KNOW THAT PARENTS OR KIDS

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.878
IN THE CHILD'S FIRST EDUCATOR

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:37.546
THE OTHER FOR OUR FIRST TEACHER

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:41.550
AND I THINK COALBED. HAS REALLY

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:43.919
REALLY. MADE PARENTS MORE AWARE

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:44.820
OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:47.456

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.106
PARENTS NEED THE TOOLS AND THE

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.307
RESOURCES TO GET THEIR CHILDREN

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:06.608

BEHAVIORS NOT JUST IN THE

CLASSROOM BUT AT HOME. I THINK

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:11.814
THAT PARENTS ARE VERY TICKED

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.516

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:15.484
SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL BOARD

YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A GREAT

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.166
PLACE FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK

ABOUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF-

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.359

THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.278
THIS WORK. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

SCHOOL- BUT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:24.392

IF WE DON'T PARTNER WITH

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.705
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:37.772
THAT'S NOT A CONTRACTING OUT

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.241
STATEMENT OR DOING IN AND AROUND

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.775

IT IMPACTS OUR BABIES. FOR MANY

01:57:32.145 --> 01:57:33.646
DECADES WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.114
THE OVER EXPOSURE OF BLACK

CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND EARLY

01:57:57.837 --> 01:58:00.173
LEARNING SPACES. BECAUSE WE'RE

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:01.974
TALKING ABOUT OUR BABIES. THIS

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:05.745
IS A MORAL ISSUE. IF WE DAMAGE

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:07.647
THESE YOUNG MINDS EARLY THAN WE

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.115

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:36.843
THEN THE QUESTION BY NECESSITY

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:39.312

BABIES. AND OUR CHILDREN.

01:59:52.485 --> 01:59:53.886

02:35:13.037 --> 02:35:14.805
WE FOCUSING AT ALL OF OUR

02:35:14.872 --> 02:35:17.007
ATTENTION AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:17.908
WE'RE DEALING WITH KIDS THAT

02:35:17.975 --> 02:35:20.944
HAVE. ARE REACTING TO SOMETHING

02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:23.347

THOSE THINGS. THE MORE WE CAN.

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:37.928

TRYING TO IN AG I CAN USE AN

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:42.733
EXAMPLE ESSENTIALLY WHEN I WENT

02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:44.668

BUDGET IN MIND. TO IMPLEMENT ALL

02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:15.685
OF THIS AND SO YOU KNOW GIVEN

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:19.122
THAT WE HAVE A FOUR BILLION

02:43:19.189 --> 02:43:19.756
DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY HERE. BASED

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:21.625
OFF OF YOUR PLAN TO DO THIS.

02:43:21.691 --> 02:43:24.227
WHAT AMOUNT DO YOU NEED TO KIND

02:43:24.294 --> 02:43:27.464
OF GET THIS OFF AND RUNNING. I

02:43:27.531 --> 02:43:28.765
THINK IT'S A QUESTION GERMANS

02:43:28.832 --> 02:43:32.435
HOUSE I. I THINK THAT THE

02:43:32.502 --> 02:43:33.670
CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:43:33.737 --> 02:43:37.307
INITIATIVE IS. I AM. IN THINKING

02:43:37.374 --> 02:43:39.910
ABOUT THIS ECOSYSTEM IS FOCUSED

02:43:39.976 --> 02:43:41.978
ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS

02:43:42.045 --> 02:43:43.680
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE

02:43:43.747 --> 02:43:45.515
USE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH.

02:43:45.582 --> 02:43:48.285
AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME

02:43:48.351 --> 02:43:50.220
CHILDREN THAT HAVE THOSE NEEDS

02:43:50.287 --> 02:43:52.289
HAVE OTHER NEEDS AS WELL. AND

02:43:52.355 --> 02:43:54.157
IT'S STILL PART OF THE WORK OF

02:43:54.224 --> 02:43:55.792
THE INITIATIVE EVEN THOSE SOME

02:43:55.859 --> 02:43:57.294
OF THOSE OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT

02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:59.362
NECESSARILY DIRECTLY IN THE

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:01.364
CONTEXT OF THE INITIATIVE. THAT

02:44:01.431 --> 02:44:03.967
PART OF OUR WORK IS FIGURING OUT

02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:05.702
WHERE THOSE CONNECTION POINTS

02:44:05.769 --> 02:44:08.405
ARE SO THAT IS WE ARE DESIGNING

02:44:08.471 --> 02:44:10.440
THE ECOSYSTEM WE ARE REALLY

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:13.443
BUILDING UP MORE OF THAT AND-

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.378
CONNECT THEIR COACH FAMILIES IN

02:44:15.445 --> 02:44:17.414
WHICH THEIR NEEDS ARE CENTERED

02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:19.649
IN THE PROCESS. SO IT THIS

02:44:19.716 --> 02:44:21.318
INITIATIVE DOES NOT NECESSARILY

02:44:21.384 --> 02:44:24.254
TAKE ON DIRECTLY ALL OF THOSE

02:44:24.321 --> 02:44:25.956
OTHER ISSUES BUT WE ARE VERY

02:44:26.022 --> 02:44:28.158
COMMITTED TO BEING CONNECTED TO

02:44:28.225 --> 02:44:29.159
OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE

02:44:29.226 --> 02:44:30.860
ADDRESSING. OTHER NEEDS THAT

02:44:30.927 --> 02:44:32.562
CHILDREN AND YOUTH THEY HAVE SO

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:33.763
THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CREEK

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:38.301
NEEDED APPROACH WERE. CHILDREN

02:44:38.368 --> 02:44:39.436
YOUTH AND FAMILIES. I UNDERSTAND

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:40.604
AND SO IN THE SEACOAST. THAT

02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:41.705
YOU'RE DEVELOPING AND OBVIOUSLY

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:44.975
IT'S A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS BUT-

02:44:45.041 --> 02:44:46.476
HOW MUCH ARE WE HOW MUCH IS CAL

02:44:46.543 --> 02:44:49.279
HSS FOCUSING ON THE ZERO TO FIVE

02:44:49.346 --> 02:44:51.181
POPULATION AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:44:51.248 --> 02:44:52.782
REST OF THE POPULATION. FOR THE

02:44:52.849 --> 02:44:55.619
INITIATIVE. OKAY THE QUESTION

02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:58.188
AND SO AS WAS NOTED EARLIER

02:44:58.255 --> 02:45:00.123
THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS

02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:02.259
THAT INCLUDE ZERO TO FIVE AS

02:45:02.325 --> 02:45:04.661
PART OF THE OVERALL WORK BUT

02:45:04.728 --> 02:45:05.462
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY FIND

02:45:05.528 --> 02:45:06.329
YOUR MARK I EACH OF THOSE

02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:08.431
COMPONENTS. WERE THAT SPECIFIC

02:45:08.498 --> 02:45:10.934
AGE GROUP. THAT ZERO TO FIVE

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:12.602
POPULATION AND THEIR AND THEIR

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:14.704
PARENTS WILL BE A REALLY

02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:16.506
IMPORTANT PART OF THINKING ABOUT

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:18.108
SOME OF THE WORK YOU HEARD IN

02:45:18.174 --> 02:45:19.643
TERMS OF THAT I'M SCHOOLING

02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:21.378

MARCH FINDS PER SE BUT THERE IS-

02:45:30.787 --> 02:45:37.594
INCLUSION OF ZERO TO FIVE IN THE. A RANGE OF THE COMPONENTS

02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:39.229
WITH- YEAH AND I THINK IT WAS

02:45:39.296 --> 02:45:40.497
MEANT TO THERE WAS A FIVE

02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:41.631
HUNDRED. BILL EARMARKED. THE

02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:43.933
OTHER END BUT NOT THE LAW THE

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:45.268
ZERO TO FIVE AND SO. I GUESS AS

02:45:45.335 --> 02:45:46.536
WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE

02:45:46.603 --> 02:45:48.271
BUDGET PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO

02:45:48.338 --> 02:45:51.174

QUEER IDENTITY. AND ALSO CHRONIC

02:52:08.751 --> 02:52:11.120
ANXIETY BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY

02:52:11.187 --> 02:52:12.755
IN FEAR IN TRYING TO HIDE

02:52:12.822 --> 02:52:15.491
ASPECTS OF MYSELF AND SO AT THIS

02:52:15.558 --> 02:52:16.559
TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO

02:52:16.626 --> 02:52:19.162

OUTREACH DONE BY MY SCHOOL. AND

02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:36.279
SO I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS

02:52:36.345 --> 02:52:37.380
SUPPORT OUT THERE I DIDN'T KNOW

02:52:37.447 --> 02:52:38.481
THAT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE

02:52:38.548 --> 02:52:39.415
GOING THROUGH THE SAME

02:52:39.482 --> 02:52:41.384
CHALLENGES AS MYSELF I THOUGHT

02:52:41.451 --> 02:52:42.452
SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME SO I

02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:44.487
TRIED TO HIDE THESE THINGS AND I

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:45.221
INTERNALIZED ALL OF THESE

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:48.224

ON TO OTHER STUDENTS WHO WERE

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:58.568
SELLING THEM. AND SO I STARTED

02:52:58.634 --> 02:52:59.969
TO STRUGGLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE

02:53:00.036 --> 02:53:03.372

AVAILABLE TO ME- AND WHAT I SAW

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:12.348
OTHER PEOPLE DOING. AND SO NOT

02:53:12.415 --> 02:53:13.549

WORKING ON YOUTH DROP IN

03:41:43.890 --> 03:41:46.226
STRATEGIES. AND THOSE TWO

ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS.

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:14.454
THE IDEA IS TO BUILD OUT A

03:42:14.521 --> 03:42:16.489
CONTINUOUS SYSTEM OF CARE THIS

03:42:16.556 --> 03:42:18.124
STARTS IN THE SCHOOLS MOVED INTO

FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS BUT

03:42:26.566 --> 03:42:28.501
THE BASE OF THIS. IS REALLY TO

03:42:28.568 --> 03:42:29.903
BUILD OUT THE PREVENTION AND

03:42:29.969 --> 03:42:31.905
EARLY INTERVENTION THROUGH

03:42:31.971 --> 03:42:32.472

03:42:44.651 --> 03:42:46.486
SOME OF THE OLDER POPULATIONS.

03:42:46.553 --> 03:42:48.722
WHERE'S THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT

03:42:48.788 --> 03:42:50.623
THIS POPULATION IS MOST AT RISK

03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:52.392
FOR CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT

03:42:52.459 --> 03:42:53.827
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE CAN DO

03:42:53.893 --> 03:42:54.694
MORE IN TERMS OF PREVENTION OR

03:42:54.761 --> 03:42:56.763

03:43:08.475 --> 03:43:09.976
NEEDS DON'T ESCALATE OVER TIME.

TO SECURE THEIR FIREARMS.

03:43:49.549 --> 03:43:52.318
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE USED.

03:43:52.385 --> 03:43:53.820

THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING IT SETS

03:52:30.236 --> 03:52:30.670
TWENTY FIFTEEN IS THAT

03:52:30.736 --> 03:52:32.071
DEFINITELY WHEN SCHOOLS PUT A

03:52:32.138 --> 03:52:34.206
MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS.

03:52:34.273 --> 03:52:35.908

WE SEE DECREASES. IN SUSPENSION

03:52:38.377 --> 03:52:40.279

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:43.749
GRADUATION RATES AND A DECREASE

03:52:44.317 --> 03:52:48.354
EDUCATION. THAT IS A BIG AND-

03:52:48.421 --> 03:52:50.423
QUITE A DATA POINT TO LOOK AT IS

03:52:50.489 --> 03:52:51.791
OUR DECREASES AND REFERRALS TO

03:52:51.857 --> 03:52:53.292
SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE

03:52:53.359 --> 03:52:54.727
WITHOUT A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF

03:52:54.794 --> 03:52:57.229
SUPPORT MANY STUDENTS WHO JUST

03:52:57.296 --> 03:52:59.065
NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS OUTSIDE

03:52:59.131 --> 03:53:01.334
OF THE ERROR PREVENTION TIER ONE

03:53:01.400 --> 03:53:04.003
LEVEL AND COULD BE MITIGATED

03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:05.805
THROUGH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AND

03:53:05.871 --> 03:53:07.606

SPECIAL EDUCATION NORMALLY

03:53:10.509 --> 03:53:11.677
STUDENTS ARE REFERRED TO SPECIAL

03:53:11.744 --> 03:53:13.212
EDUCATION SO THEY CAN GET

03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:14.880
ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS BECAUSE

03:53:14.947 --> 03:53:17.316
TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATORS DO

03:53:17.383 --> 03:53:19.418
NOT KNOW HOW TO ACCESS SUPPORTS

03:53:19.485 --> 03:53:20.820
AND SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS

03:53:20.886 --> 03:53:22.188
WE SEE OVER AND OVER IN THE

03:53:22.254 --> 03:53:23.956

UP WITH THE NEEDS THAT NEED TO

03:53:43.175 --> 03:53:44.377
BE ADDRESSED THAT DAY WITHOUT

03:53:44.443 --> 03:53:46.145
HAVING TO GO THROUGH A STUDENT

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:47.513
STUDY TEAM PROCESS OR ANYTHING

03:53:47.580 --> 03:53:49.682

SUPPORT. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:53:59.892 --> 03:54:01.026
A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT

03:54:01.093 --> 03:54:02.828
JUST A REFRESHER AT TIER ONE IS

03:54:02.895 --> 03:54:05.030

TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

IF WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO THAT.

04:03:19.318 --> 04:03:20.886
WHAT THIS ALSO MEANS IS THAT

04:03:20.953 --> 04:03:22.187
EVEN IF WE DOUBLE THE NUMBER

04:03:22.254 --> 04:03:23.288

MOST OTHER STATES IN THE NATION.

04:03:31.463 --> 04:03:33.298
IN PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT ONE

04:03:33.365 --> 04:03:35.233
OF THE THINGS SINCE WE HAVEN'T.

04:03:35.300 --> 04:03:37.069
REALLY EXPERIENCED THESE FOLKS

04:03:37.135 --> 04:03:39.171
IT'S LIKE GIVING A TEACHER ONE

04:03:39.237 --> 04:03:40.439
TEXTBOOK AND THEN SAYING THE

04:03:40.505 --> 04:03:42.274

EXPERIENCE WITH REGARDS TO THESE

04:03:47.079 --> 04:03:48.313
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

04:03:48.380 --> 04:03:50.949
CALIFORNIA. SOUTH BUT IT'S ONE

04:03:51.016 --> 04:03:52.784
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

04:03:52.851 --> 04:03:54.219
THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD

04:03:54.286 --> 04:03:56.955
TRY TO HONE IN ON IS THE WORD

TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SAFETY FIRST

04:15:33.885 --> 04:15:35.086
IS IN THE- OF HARD REDUCTION

04:15:35.153 --> 04:15:36.587
WHICH DISCOURAGES YOUNG PEOPLE

04:15:36.654 --> 04:15:37.722
FROM USING ALCOHOL AND OTHER

04:15:37.789 --> 04:15:39.891
DRUGS. BUT IT OFFERS MORE THAN

04:15:39.957 --> 04:15:41.492
ABSTINENCE ONLY APPROACH BECAUSE

04:15:41.559 --> 04:15:43.294
IT ALSO PROVIDES TEENAGERS WITH

04:15:43.361 --> 04:15:45.830
INFORMATION TO KEEP THEMSELVES

04:15:45.897 --> 04:15:47.098
AND THEIR FRIENDS SAY IF AND

04:15:47.165 --> 04:15:50.468
WHEN. THEY TO. IF AND WHEN THEY

04:15:50.535 --> 04:15:52.303
DO ENCOUNTER THESE SUBSTANCES.

04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:53.805
FOR EXAMPLE ABSTINENCE ONLY

04:15:53.871 --> 04:15:55.573
EDUCATION MIL MAY TELL YOUNG

04:15:55.640 --> 04:15:57.709
PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD REFRAIN

04:15:57.775 --> 04:15:59.310
FROM USING DRUGS BECAUSE THEY

04:15:59.377 --> 04:16:01.345
COULD OVERDOSE. HARM REDUCTION

04:16:01.412 --> 04:16:04.015
EDUCATION HOWEVER EXPLAINS HOW

04:16:04.082 --> 04:16:05.316
TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF DRUG

04:16:05.383 --> 04:16:07.919
OVERDOSES HOW TO RESPOND AND HOW

04:16:07.985 --> 04:16:09.921
TO GET HELP IF THEY FEAR THAT A

04:16:09.987 --> 04:16:12.056
FRIEND IS OVERDOSING. IN

04:16:12.123 --> 04:16:13.991
ADDITION TO REVEAL FACT WE

04:16:14.058 --> 04:16:15.159
STRUCK EDUCATION FOR

04:16:15.226 --> 04:16:16.961
CALIFORNIA'S YEAR WE ALSO

04:16:17.028 --> 04:16:18.763
RECOMMEND THAT INCREASE ACCESS

04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:20.465
TO SUBSTANCE TREATMENT THAT

04:16:20.531 --> 04:16:22.233
INCLUDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND

04:16:22.300 --> 04:16:24.001
MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT IS

04:16:24.068 --> 04:16:25.770
NEEDED. THIS MUST BE DONE

04:16:25.837 --> 04:16:27.672
HOWEVER WITH THE RACIAL EQUITY

04:16:27.739 --> 04:16:30.208
PERSPECTIVE IN RECENT NATIONAL

04:16:30.274 --> 04:16:31.909
STUDY FOUND THAT BLACK TEENS

04:16:31.976 --> 04:16:34.579
WERE 85% LESS LIKELY TO BE

04:16:34.645 --> 04:16:36.114
PRESCRIBED THIS LIFESAVING

04:16:36.180 --> 04:16:37.915
TREATMENT AFTER AN OVERDOSE.

04:16:37.982 --> 04:16:39.350
THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS

04:16:39.417 --> 04:16:41.385
AND FOR LATINOS THIS NUMBER IS

04:16:41.452 --> 04:16:43.321
EVEN HIGHER THESE RACIAL

04:16:43.387 --> 04:16:46.390
DISPARITIES EXIST RESULTS AS

04:16:46.457 --> 04:16:49.694

04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:54.499
CRIMINALIZATION AND

04:16:54.565 --> 04:16:56.400
STIGMATIZATION DOES NOT PROVIDE

04:16:56.467 --> 04:16:58.035
YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE PROPER

04:16:58.102 --> 04:16:59.904

INVESTING AND SUSTAINABLE

04:26:02.246 --> 04:26:04.682
STRATEGY STRATEGIES LIKE KIDS

04:26:04.748 --> 04:26:06.750
GUNS. DO COMMUNITIES SCHOOL

04:26:06.817 --> 04:26:08.886
INITIATIVES THE STATE APPEARS TO

04:26:08.952 --> 04:26:11.155
BE PURSUING A STUDENT CENTER

04:26:11.221 --> 04:26:13.490
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. BUT WHY

04:26:13.557 --> 04:26:15.659
STOP THERE SO THE NEXT QUESTION

04:26:15.726 --> 04:26:17.061
TO ASK SO WHAT WILL THE STATE

04:26:17.127 --> 04:26:19.963
DUE TO INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE

04:26:20.030 --> 04:26:20.531
STUDENT CENTERED INITIATIVES

NEW CRISIS LINE AND A MEMBER OF

04:27:08.379 --> 04:27:09.546
A LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED

04:27:09.613 --> 04:27:11.281
ORGANIZATION THAT PARTNERS WITH

04:27:11.348 --> 04:27:13.183
MY SCHOOL TO ASSESS STUDENT

04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:15.252
MENTAL HEALTH AND IN RESPONSE

CAMPUS THE ANSWER TO THE NEEDS

04:27:19.390 --> 04:27:21.625
OF STUDENTS. SO ADDING ON TO MIA

04:27:21.692 --> 04:27:23.727
ANOTHER BENEFIT OF PEER TO PEER

04:27:23.794 --> 04:27:25.329
PROGRAMS AND SOMETHING THAT IS

04:27:25.396 --> 04:27:26.430
PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THIS

04:27:26.497 --> 04:27:28.232
COMMITTEE. IS THAT PEER TO PEER

04:27:28.298 --> 04:27:30.100
PROGRAMS AREN'T LOW COST AND

04:27:30.167 --> 04:27:32.703
HIGH EFFICIENCY. IT'S CHEAPER TO

04:27:32.770 --> 04:27:34.805
PAY STIPENDS FOR STUDENTS THAN

04:27:34.872 --> 04:27:36.807
FULL SALARIES OR OTHER EXPENSES

04:27:36.874 --> 04:27:38.776
AND EFFICIENCY COMES FROM YOU

04:27:38.842 --> 04:27:40.644
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

04:27:40.711 --> 04:27:42.079
GROW UP IN AN ERA OF SOCIAL

04:27:42.146 --> 04:27:44.481
MEDIA THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER NEW

04:27:44.548 --> 04:27:46.350
DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOPMENTS WHICH

04:27:46.417 --> 04:27:48.285
MAKE YOUTH MORE LIKELY TO TURN

04:27:48.352 --> 04:27:50.587
TO OTHER YOUTH FOR HELP. KRISTAN

04:27:50.654 --> 04:27:51.855
EMERGE WITH THE ALLIANCE

04:27:51.922 --> 04:27:53.991
MENTIONED BEFORE SB EIGHT OH

04:27:54.057 --> 04:27:54.858
THREE WHICH IS A GREAT STEP

04:27:54.925 --> 04:27:55.959
FORWARD IN THE PEER TO PEER

04:27:56.026 --> 04:27:58.061
WORLD BUT NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED

04:27:58.128 --> 04:27:59.897
UP WITH MORE LEGISLATION. THAT

04:27:59.963 --> 04:28:02.433
INCLUDES YOUTH UNDER EIGHTEEN AT

04:28:02.499 --> 04:28:04.768
THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE. THING ELSE

04:28:04.835 --> 04:28:06.637
I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THAT AT

04:28:06.703 --> 04:28:07.671
MY SCHOOL AND I'M SURE MANY

04:28:07.738 --> 04:28:10.007
OTHERS AWARENESS IS NOT THE

04:28:10.073 --> 04:28:12.209
PROBLEM. WE GENERALLY KNOW WHAT

04:28:12.276 --> 04:28:13.844
MENTAL HEALTH IS AND HOW TO

04:28:13.911 --> 04:28:16.079
IDENTIFY WHEN WE NEED HELP BUT

04:28:16.146 --> 04:28:17.981
THE PROBLEM IS THAT HELP DOESN'T

04:28:18.048 --> 04:28:20.083
EXIST DIRECTLY ON CAMPUS. SOME

04:28:20.150 --> 04:28:22.152
OF MY FRIENDS SEE THERAPIST

04:28:22.219 --> 04:28:24.054
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT

04:28:24.121 --> 04:28:26.123
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THERE P.

04:28:26.190 --> 04:28:28.258
IS EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE AND

04:28:28.325 --> 04:28:29.927
A LOT OF MY PARENTS HAVE A LOT

04:28:29.993 --> 04:28:31.795
OF MY FRIENDS HAVE PARENTS THAT

04:28:31.862 --> 04:28:33.564
DON'T BELIEVE MENTAL HEALTH IS

04:28:33.630 --> 04:28:35.265
AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF CULTURAL

04:28:35.332 --> 04:28:37.267
STIGMA. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE

04:28:37.334 --> 04:28:39.036
PEER TO PEER IS ONE OF THE BEST

04:28:39.102 --> 04:28:40.537
SOLUTIONS WHEN WE'RE TALKING

04:28:40.604 --> 04:28:42.272
ABOUT PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS I

04:28:42.339 --> 04:28:44.007
AND MANY OF MY PEERS. THAT I'VE

04:28:44.074 --> 04:28:46.276
TALKED TO ENVISION A STUDENT

04:28:46.343 --> 04:28:47.711
STRUGGLING WITH LET'S SAY THE

04:28:47.778 --> 04:28:49.146
PANDEMIC CREATING A LOT OF

04:28:49.213 --> 04:28:51.215
ANXIETY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO

04:28:51.281 --> 04:28:53.517
UNCOMMON RIGHT NOW. THAT STUDENT

04:28:53.584 --> 04:28:55.319
CAN WALK INTO A DESIGNATED ROOM

04:28:55.385 --> 04:28:57.754
DIRECTLY ON THEIR CAMPUS. INSIDE

04:28:57.821 --> 04:28:59.523
THE ROOM WOULD BE SEVERAL CARE

04:28:59.590 --> 04:29:00.924
COUNSELORS WERE JUST OTHER

04:29:00.991 --> 04:29:02.793
STUDENTS FROM THAT SCHOOL WHO'VE

04:29:02.860 --> 04:29:04.661
UNDERGONE RIGOROUS TRAINING IN

04:29:04.728 --> 04:29:06.296
MENTAL HEALTH. THE STRUGGLING

04:29:06.363 --> 04:29:08.031
STUDENT CAN TALK TO ANY OF THE

04:29:08.098 --> 04:29:09.366
PEER COUNSELORS IN A

04:29:09.433 --> 04:29:11.702
CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION. ONE

04:29:11.768 --> 04:29:13.136
MODEL THAT WE FOUND PARTICULARLY

04:29:13.203 --> 04:29:14.705
EFFECTIVE IS FROM AN

04:29:14.771 --> 04:29:15.839
ORGANIZATION CALLED SOURCES OF

04:29:15.906 --> 04:29:17.674
STRENGTH WHICH TRAINS THE PEER

04:29:17.741 --> 04:29:19.443
COUNSELORS TO SUGGEST RELEVANT

04:29:19.510 --> 04:29:21.011
RESOURCES AND HEALTHY COPING

04:29:21.078 --> 04:29:22.546
METHODS TO THE STRUGGLING

04:29:22.613 --> 04:29:24.982
STUDENTS. I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING

04:29:25.048 --> 04:29:26.617
THIS CORRECTLY BUT AS ASSEMBLY

04:29:26.683 --> 04:29:28.719
MAN SEYARTO TOUCHED ON IT'S

04:29:28.785 --> 04:29:30.420
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER MORE

04:29:30.487 --> 04:29:32.422
PREVENTION BASED PROGRAMS. WHICH

04:29:32.489 --> 04:29:33.891
IS ANOTHER REASON PEER TO PEER

04:29:33.957 --> 04:29:35.993
IS SO EFFECTIVE. SINCE CAN COME

04:29:36.059 --> 04:29:38.195
IN FOR WHAT THEY SEE AS MINOR

04:29:38.262 --> 04:29:39.997
PROBLEMS JUST TO TALK IT OUT.

04:29:40.063 --> 04:29:41.465
SINCE MOST MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

04:29:41.532 --> 04:29:43.467
DON'T DEVELOP AT FULL SEVERITY

04:29:43.534 --> 04:29:45.035
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE WHEN

04:29:45.102 --> 04:29:45.836
YOUTH ARE GOING THROUGH

04:29:45.903 --> 04:29:47.938
CHALLENGES IN THEIR

04:29:48.005 --> 04:29:48.839
DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS IN HIGH

04:29:48.906 --> 04:29:50.607
SCHOOL. GRAMS CAN TACKLE THE

04:29:50.674 --> 04:29:52.676
ISSUE BEFORE IT BECOMES CRITICAL

04:29:52.743 --> 04:29:54.278
SO WE'RE NOT CHASING THE PROBLEM

04:29:54.344 --> 04:29:56.179
AFTER THE FACT. IT'S ALL

04:29:56.246 --> 04:29:57.781
RESPONSIBILITIES TO SET UP THE

04:29:57.848 --> 04:29:59.550
NEXT GENERATION WITH THE MENTAL

04:29:59.616 --> 04:30:01.585
HEALTH RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

04:30:01.652 --> 04:30:04.054
SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND IN THEIR

04:30:04.121 --> 04:30:07.057
PERSONAL LIVES. THE END I AND

04:30:07.124 --> 04:30:08.559
MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE FIRMLY

04:30:08.625 --> 04:30:09.693
BELIEVE PEER TO PEER PROGRAM

04:30:09.760 --> 04:30:11.461
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FUTURE

04:30:11.528 --> 04:30:13.397
BUDGET AND IN FUTURE CALIFORNIA

04:30:13.463 --> 04:30:14.998
LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

04:30:15.065 --> 04:30:18.435
TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I

04:30:18.502 --> 04:30:21.138
AGAIN WANT TO EXTEND A SPECIAL

04:30:21.204 --> 04:30:23.040
APPRECIATION TO THE YOUTH

04:30:23.106 --> 04:30:25.943
SPEAKERS BOTH TO DNIA AND-

04:30:26.009 --> 04:30:28.512
SHARIAH IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:30:28.579 --> 04:30:30.547
CENTER OURSELVES AROUND. THE

04:30:30.614 --> 04:30:32.316
STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:35.519
LIVED EXPERIENCES AND APPRECIATE

04:30:35.586 --> 04:30:36.420
THE VOICE THEY HAVE HELPED TO

04:30:36.486 --> 04:30:38.322
BRING HERE TODAY. AS THIS IS THE

04:30:38.388 --> 04:30:39.923
CONCLUSION OF PANEL THREE I WILL

04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:41.825
BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR TO ASK

04:30:41.892 --> 04:30:44.194
A FEW QUESTIONS AND PARDON THE

04:30:44.261 --> 04:30:45.729
LATE HOUR BUT IT IS OUR

04:30:45.796 --> 04:30:47.998
OPPORTUNITY TO DIG INTO A LITTLE

04:30:48.065 --> 04:30:50.067
BIT OF DETAILS. AND SO I'D LIKE

04:30:50.133 --> 04:30:52.035
TO BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR

04:30:52.102 --> 04:30:53.537

JONES AS WELL AS JC COOPER.

04:30:56.206 --> 04:30:57.941
BECAUSE YOU WERE REALLY CLEAR

04:30:58.008 --> 04:30:59.576
ABOUT SAYING THAT WE NEEDED TO

04:30:59.643 --> 04:31:02.079
DEFINE GOALS AND TO STAND THEM

04:31:02.145 --> 04:31:05.115
UP OVER TIME AND BE INTENTIONAL

04:31:05.182 --> 04:31:06.650
THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND AT

04:31:06.717 --> 04:31:08.986
THE OUTSET WHICH METRICS WE WILL

04:31:09.052 --> 04:31:11.054
BE EVALUATING THE CHILDREN AND

04:31:11.121 --> 04:31:11.688
YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:31:11.755 --> 04:31:16.326
INITIATIVE. HOW AND WHEN WILL WE

04:31:16.393 --> 04:31:18.662
BE ABLE TO MEASURE THIS PROGRESS

04:31:18.729 --> 04:31:20.297
. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- MELISSA

04:31:20.364 --> 04:31:23.700
STAFFORD JONES. AND SO WE ARE

04:31:23.767 --> 04:31:26.003
IT. IT'S A SORT OF A STAGE

04:31:26.069 --> 04:31:29.239
PROCESS SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO

04:31:29.306 --> 04:31:31.775
DEFINE THE OUTCOME AREAS THROUGH

04:31:31.842 --> 04:31:32.709
THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

04:31:32.776 --> 04:31:34.711
PROCESS THAT I DESCRIBED. AND

04:31:34.778 --> 04:31:35.779
THEN YOU ARE CORRECT THE NEXT

04:31:35.846 --> 04:31:37.547
STEP AFTER THAT ONCE WE DEFINE

04:31:37.614 --> 04:31:40.083
THE AREAS OF OUTCOMES WHERE WE

04:31:40.150 --> 04:31:42.919
ARE. VIV'S TURN DESIGNATE BASED

04:31:42.986 --> 04:31:44.488
ON ENGAGEMENT WITH A RANGE OF

04:31:44.554 --> 04:31:45.722
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CHILDREN

04:31:45.789 --> 04:31:46.690
YOUTH AND FAMILIES WILL BE THE

04:31:46.757 --> 04:31:48.258
FOCUS FOR WHAT WE HOPE TO

04:31:48.325 --> 04:31:49.960
ACCOMPLISH OVER THE FIVE YEARS.

04:31:50.027 --> 04:31:51.261
YOU'RE RIGHT WE WILL THEN NEED

04:31:51.328 --> 04:31:53.463
TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC METRICS THAT

04:31:53.530 --> 04:31:55.098
BUILT THOSE OUT SO WE CAN TAKE A

04:31:55.165 --> 04:31:56.633
RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY

04:31:56.700 --> 04:31:58.935
APPROACH SO OUR OUR TENTATIVE

04:31:59.002 --> 04:32:00.771
PLAN IS TO ESTABLISH SORT OF

04:32:00.837 --> 04:32:02.939
BAD. A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ONCE

04:32:03.006 --> 04:32:04.574
WE HAVE THOSE OUT CUTS AREAS

04:32:04.641 --> 04:32:06.043
BETTER DEFINED TO STAKEHOLDER

04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:09.746
ENGAGEMENT. WHO ARE. AND WHAT

04:32:09.813 --> 04:32:11.782
SPECIFIC METRICS WE SHOULD USE

04:32:11.848 --> 04:32:13.150
THE ALSO AS I MENTIONED HAVE A

04:32:13.216 --> 04:32:14.818
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT AN

04:32:14.885 --> 04:32:17.421
EVALUATION AND WE WILL BE

04:32:17.487 --> 04:32:19.256

04:32:19.322 --> 04:32:21.725
WITH EXPERTISE IN BATH. AND

04:32:21.792 --> 04:32:23.694
EVALUATION AND SO WE WILL ALSO

04:32:23.760 --> 04:32:26.329
BE INTO THEIR EXPERTISE TO HELP

04:32:26.396 --> 04:32:28.365
US FINALISE WHAT THOSE SPECIFIC

04:32:28.432 --> 04:32:30.634
METRICS EVEN IF THEY ARE TRULY

04:32:30.701 --> 04:32:33.170
THINGS THAT WE CAN MEASURE OVER

04:32:33.236 --> 04:32:34.237
TIME. THANK YOU FOR ANSWER I

04:32:34.304 --> 04:32:36.773
LOOK FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATURE-

04:32:36.840 --> 04:32:37.841
ALSO WORKING WITH THE

04:32:37.908 --> 04:32:39.342
ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT

04:32:39.409 --> 04:32:43.580
THE METRICS ARE- WE AGREE UPON

04:32:43.647 --> 04:32:45.782
WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE MEASURE.

04:32:45.849 --> 04:32:46.983
I'D LIKE TO ASK THE NEXT

04:32:47.050 --> 04:32:49.219
QUESTION OF GC COOPER AS HE WENT

04:32:49.286 --> 04:32:51.722
THROUGH SEVERAL- TIMELINES AND

04:32:51.788 --> 04:32:53.757
DATES BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO

04:32:53.824 --> 04:32:55.392
FOCUS ON THAT HE CALLED

04:32:55.459 --> 04:32:58.528
COUNSELED. PLATFORM THAT WAS

04:32:58.595 --> 04:33:00.430
MENTIONED AS AN INITIATIVE. AS

04:33:00.497 --> 04:33:02.799
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE

04:33:02.866 --> 04:33:04.668
CAN REASONABLY EXPECT FOR

04:33:04.735 --> 04:33:06.837
STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GET

04:33:06.903 --> 04:33:08.305
ONLINE AND ACCESS SERVICES.

04:36:47.324 --> 04:36:48.959
DOLLARS SUPPORTING THIS

04:36:49.025 --> 04:36:53.930
INITIATIVE. AND IF NOT WHY NOT.

04:36:53.997 --> 04:36:55.865
ALSO KERN- THE WORK THAT WE ARE

04:36:55.932 --> 04:36:56.933

PRIVATE PAYERS AND MEDICARE

04:37:08.812 --> 04:37:10.647
MANAGED CARE PLANS. THEY WILL BE

04:37:10.714 --> 04:37:12.816

HIGHER EDUCATION. SO THEY WOULD

04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:21.758
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR

04:37:21.825 --> 04:37:23.193
THOSE SERVICES HOWEVER AT THIS

04:37:23.259 --> 04:37:25.528

THE MODEL OUT OF AUSTRALIA THE

04:41:07.584 --> 04:41:09.852
HEAD SPACE MODEL THAT THAT ALL

04:41:09.919 --> 04:41:11.621
COMES BUILT OFF OF. IT THE

04:41:11.688 --> 04:41:14.090
UNIQUENESS ISN'T THAT CONNECTS

04:41:14.157 --> 04:41:15.491
IT INTO THE SERVICES THAT ARE

04:41:15.558 --> 04:41:17.193
THERE THE UNIQUENESS IS THE

04:41:17.260 --> 04:41:19.462
DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. THAT IS

04:41:19.529 --> 04:41:22.298
DESIGNED TO BE A LOW BARRIER OR

04:41:22.365 --> 04:41:24.367
IDEALLY NO BARRIER ACCESS TO

04:41:24.434 --> 04:41:25.401
CARE WHAT WE SEE WITH YOUNG

04:41:25.468 --> 04:41:28.571
PEOPLE. IS THERE NOT ROUTINELY

IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

04:41:31.541 --> 04:41:33.610
PSYCHOSIS OR OTHER KINDS OF

04:41:33.676 --> 04:41:36.112
CHALLENGES. SO BY REMOVING

04:41:36.179 --> 04:41:40.283
BARRIERS MUST INCLUDE. CREATING

04:41:40.350 --> 04:41:42.652
SIMPLE WAYS TO PAY FOR THE

04:41:42.719 --> 04:41:44.954
SERVICE THAT DON'T REQUIRE. THE

04:41:45.021 --> 04:41:47.790
INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING TO WALK

04:41:47.857 --> 04:41:48.958
THROUGH IT YOU KNOW AN

04:41:49.025 --> 04:41:51.294
ENROLLMENT PROCESS. RIGHT AND

04:41:51.361 --> 04:41:54.030
SO. SO THE ISSUE ISN'T SO MUCH

04:41:54.097 --> 04:41:56.299
AROUND. HOW CAN WE TAKE AN

04:41:56.366 --> 04:41:58.334
EXISTING MEDICARE L. FUNDING

04:41:58.401 --> 04:42:00.837
STREAM AND TEACH PROVIDERS TO

04:42:00.903 --> 04:42:02.672
BILL MEDICARE I'LL THE QUESTION

04:42:02.739 --> 04:42:06.309
IS HOW CAN WE- DESIGN A STRATEGY

04:42:06.376 --> 04:42:07.810
WHERE MEDIC HAL COMMERCIAL

04:42:07.877 --> 04:42:10.680
INSURANCE MANAGED CARE PLANS.

04:42:10.747 --> 04:42:13.116
ALLOW PROVIDERS TO REALLY

04:42:13.182 --> 04:42:15.118
PRIORITIZE SERVICES FOR THE

04:42:15.184 --> 04:42:16.819
PEOPLE THAT WERE THAT WERE

04:42:16.886 --> 04:42:17.687
SERVING WE SEE THIS IN

04:42:17.754 --> 04:42:20.223
CONVERSATIONS. IN THE IN THE

04:42:20.290 --> 04:42:22.158
DEEPER INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH

04:42:22.225 --> 04:42:23.293
SYSTEM. I L. A. COUNTY DIRECTOR

04:42:23.359 --> 04:42:25.428
JOHN SHARON TALKS ABOUT. IF I

04:42:25.495 --> 04:42:26.963
COULD SPEND MORE TIME SERVING

04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:28.965
PEOPLE AND LESS TIME WORRYING

04:42:29.032 --> 04:42:30.700
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN

04:42:30.767 --> 04:42:32.669
WE COULD DO A FUNDAMENTALLY

04:42:32.735 --> 04:42:34.804
BETTER JOB AT A LOWER COST FOR

04:42:34.871 --> 04:42:35.471
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO

04:42:35.538 --> 04:42:38.241
SIR. SO WITH ALL CO WE'RE

04:42:38.308 --> 04:42:40.143
ALREADY EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES

04:42:40.209 --> 04:42:42.211
WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHO ARE

04:42:42.278 --> 04:42:44.947
STRUGGLING TO DESIGN. TO IT TO

04:42:45.014 --> 04:42:47.250
HAVE FIDELITY TO THE MODEL. THAT

04:42:47.317 --> 04:42:49.018
WHEN A YOUNG PERSON WALKS IN

04:42:49.085 --> 04:42:51.587
WHETHER IT'S A SORE KNEE. A

04:42:51.654 --> 04:42:53.589
VACCINE FOR DEALING WITH

04:42:53.656 --> 04:42:54.924
DEPRESSION THAT THEY GET THE

04:42:54.991 --> 04:42:57.160
SERVICE ON THE SPOT IT ISN'T A

04:42:57.226 --> 04:42:58.861
REFERRAL COME IN I CAN DEAL WITH

04:42:58.928 --> 04:43:00.930
A SORE KNEE. BUT THE DEPRESSION

04:43:00.997 --> 04:43:02.065
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT THREE

04:43:02.131 --> 04:43:04.133
WEEKS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE

04:43:04.200 --> 04:43:06.102
SENT TO THE SHOP DOWN THE

04:43:06.169 --> 04:43:07.704
STREET. IT'S THE IDEA OF

04:43:07.770 --> 04:43:10.106
BUILDING A SITE THAT IS.

04:43:10.173 --> 04:43:11.674
IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE DOUBLE TO

04:43:11.741 --> 04:43:14.077
A YOUNG PERSON AS DESIGNED FOR

04:43:14.143 --> 04:43:17.547

04:43:17.613 --> 04:43:18.948
RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS

04:43:19.015 --> 04:43:20.783
REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PARRIS

04:43:20.850 --> 04:43:24.620

THIS PROJECT IS DOING IS REALLY

04:43:29.792 --> 04:43:31.627
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING TO

04:43:31.694 --> 04:43:33.596
TAKE FOR US T BE ABLE TO DESIGN

04:43:33.663 --> 04:43:35.531
SERVICES AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS

04:43:35.598 --> 04:43:37.333
THAT WILL BE RESPONSIVE NOT JUST

04:43:37.400 --> 04:43:38.334
IN THE COMMUNITY BUT IN THE

04:43:38.401 --> 04:43:40.670
SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THE YOUNG THE

04:43:40.737 --> 04:43:41.471
BECAUSE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

04:43:41.537 --> 04:43:43.139
BOTH IN THE SCHOOLS AND IN THE

04:43:43.206 --> 04:43:45.375
COMMUNITY AND SO I'M THE GOOD

04:43:45.441 --> 04:43:48.211
NEWS IS WE HAVE A FEW YEARS OF-

04:43:48.277 --> 04:43:50.913
INCENTIVE FUNDS FROM THE STATE

04:43:50.980 --> 04:43:53.516
AND WE'RE- WE'RE- VERY EXCITED

TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

04:43:54.684 --> 04:43:56.085
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AROUND

EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE FUNDS TO

04:43:57.120 --> 04:43:59.155
UNDERSTAND. HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE

04:43:59.222 --> 04:44:00.189
TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO BRING

04:44:00.256 --> 04:44:02.892
PEOPLE TOGETHER AND PART OF THAT

04:44:02.959 --> 04:44:06.095
IS RECOGNIZING HOW THE ALL CO

04:44:06.162 --> 04:44:08.064
GET DROP IN SERVICES MAY

04:44:08.131 --> 04:44:10.166
ACTUALLY REDUCE LOWER REDUCE THE

04:44:10.233 --> 04:44:12.335
OVERALL COST OF CARE TO BOTH

04:44:12.402 --> 04:44:13.936
MEDICARE L. AND PRIVATE

04:44:14.003 --> 04:44:16.205
INSURANCE IN WAYS THAT WE CAN

04:44:16.272 --> 04:44:19.142
BEGIN TO BUILD IN. IN THE FISCAL

04:44:19.208 --> 04:44:21.544
INCENTIVES INTO THE MODEL ITSELF

04:44:21.611 --> 04:44:23.379
SO THAT THOSE PAYMENT SYSTEMS

04:44:23.446 --> 04:44:25.515
ARE RESPONSIVE IN WAYS THAT-

04:44:25.581 --> 04:44:28.985
AGAIN IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS EASY

04:44:29.051 --> 04:44:30.119
TO DO IT WON'T SCALE. THAT WE

04:44:30.186 --> 04:44:31.187
HAVE TO GET TO IN TERMS OF

04:44:31.254 --> 04:44:33.189
FINANCING I HOPE THAT WAS A

04:44:33.256 --> 04:44:33.990
LITTLE RAMBLING BUT DOES CLEAR

04:44:34.056 --> 04:44:35.958
UP. ALONG THOSE LINES AND

04:44:36.025 --> 04:44:38.728
FOCUSING ON SCALING CAN WE

IS THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASON

04:45:01.284 --> 04:45:02.552
FOR WHY THE SITES THAT WE

FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

04:48:07.637 --> 04:48:10.740
DOLLARS. COULD BE USED TO EXPAND

04:48:10.806 --> 04:48:11.807
THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS THAT ARE

PUBLIC HEALTH. I BELIEVE MARIA A

04:48:19.415 --> 04:48:22.885
CHOLA- YOU HAD STATED THAT THE

04:48:22.952 --> 04:48:24.854
TARGET FOR THE OVERDOSE CAMPAIGN

04:48:24.920 --> 04:48:27.056
IS SIXTEEN YEARS AND OLDER AND

04:48:27.123 --> 04:48:28.357
FOR THE FUNCTIONAL CAMPAIGN

04:48:28.424 --> 04:48:31.260
IT'S- TWENTY ONE YEARS AND OLDER

04:48:31.327 --> 04:48:33.863
AND YET. FROM THE DPA EARLIER

04:48:33.929 --> 04:48:39.168
TODAY. WE HEARD THAT 14% WERE-

04:48:39.235 --> 04:48:42.071
USING BY SEVENTH GRADE AND 30%

04:48:42.138 --> 04:48:44.306
BY NINTH GRADE THAT I'D LIKE TO

04:48:44.373 --> 04:48:47.943
TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF I CAN. IS

04:48:48.010 --> 04:48:49.845
THERE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT

04:48:49.912 --> 04:48:51.447
WE NEED TO START WITH YOUNGER

04:48:51.514 --> 04:48:52.848
KIDS WHO ARE ENGAGING IN

04:48:52.915 --> 04:48:54.550
SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHO ARE

04:48:54.617 --> 04:48:57.186
EXPERIENCING OVERDOSES AND-

04:48:57.253 --> 04:48:58.821
USING FENTANYL WITHOUT KNOWING

04:48:58.888 --> 04:49:02.224
IT AND- SHOULDN'T. OUR CAMPAIGNS

04:49:02.291 --> 04:49:04.126
THAN BE FOCUSED ON A YOUNGER AGE

04:49:04.193 --> 04:49:08.197
THAN WE HAVE THUS FAR. SO IT MAY

04:49:08.264 --> 04:49:09.498
DIFFER TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES

04:49:09.565 --> 04:49:11.333
ON THIS BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

04:49:11.400 --> 04:49:13.035
THAT PART OF THESE CAMPAIGNS WE

04:49:13.102 --> 04:49:15.104
WILL BE USING AND- AS I

04:49:15.171 --> 04:49:16.072
MENTIONED WILL BE USING A

04:49:16.138 --> 04:49:17.440
CONTRACTOR TO COME IN AND

04:49:17.506 --> 04:49:18.974
EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND

04:49:19.041 --> 04:49:21.610
IN THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT GAPS.

04:49:21.677 --> 04:49:24.246
AB BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ROBIN

04:49:24.313 --> 04:49:26.048

04:49:26.115 --> 04:49:28.718
STACY INFORMATION OUT ON THIS

04:49:28.784 --> 04:49:31.320
ONE. I THIS IS ROBIN

CHRISTIANSEN WITH THE SUBSTANCE

04:49:32.722 --> 04:49:34.123
AN ADDICTION PREVENTION BRANCH

04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:35.825
AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

04:49:35.891 --> 04:49:37.326

04:49:40.229 --> 04:49:41.997
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE HAVE THE

04:49:42.064 --> 04:49:43.432
DATA WE HAVE THE SAME DATA

04:49:43.499 --> 04:49:45.134
REPORTED FROM THE NATIONAL

04:49:45.201 --> 04:49:47.636
INSTITUTES ON. DRUG ABUSE AROUND

04:49:47.703 --> 04:49:50.573
AGE OF ONSET OF SUBSTANCE USE

04:49:50.639 --> 04:49:52.007
AND THAT RANGES ACROSS A NUMBER

04:49:52.074 --> 04:49:53.776

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OPIOIDS

04:49:58.581 --> 04:50:00.783
SO ONE OF THE TARGETS OF THIS

04:50:00.850 --> 04:50:03.219
CAMPAIGN IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND

04:50:03.285 --> 04:50:05.387
OPIOID USE AND ALSO BETTER KNOWN

04:50:05.454 --> 04:50:06.655
THAT IS DUE IN PART TO THE

04:50:06.722 --> 04:50:09.558
SOURCE OF THE FUNDING WHICH THEY

04:50:09.625 --> 04:50:10.559
OPEN RIGHT SETTLEMENT FUNDS.

04:50:10.626 --> 04:50:11.727
BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE LOOKED

04:50:11.794 --> 04:50:13.963
AT BOTH THE BURDEN OF OVERDOSE

04:50:14.029 --> 04:50:16.432
DEATHS AND THE MORBIDITY AND

04:50:16.499 --> 04:50:18.367
MORTALITY AND THOSE NUMBERS WERE

04:50:18.434 --> 04:50:20.035
USED TO HELP TO FORM THE BASIS

04:50:20.102 --> 04:50:22.037
OF THOSE NUMBERS. I ALSO WANT TO

04:50:22.104 --> 04:50:24.406
ECHO WHAT MARIA HAS SAID THERE

04:50:24.473 --> 04:50:25.875
WILL BE A STAGE OF FORMATIVE

04:50:25.941 --> 04:50:29.245
RESEARCH IN WHICH WE WILL BE.

04:50:29.311 --> 04:50:31.313
CITING DEEPLY INTO BOTH THE DATA

04:50:31.380 --> 04:50:33.115

SURVEY DATA AND ALSO INFORMATION

04:50:35.818 --> 04:50:37.686
THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM FOCUS

04:50:37.753 --> 04:50:39.221
GROUPS SURVEY INFORMATION

04:50:39.288 --> 04:50:40.689
OUTSIDE IRAQ THAT WILL HELP TO

04:50:40.756 --> 04:50:43.993
INFORM THE AGE RANGE THAT WE

04:50:44.059 --> 04:50:45.027
WILL BE TARGETING WITH THE

04:50:45.094 --> 04:50:46.662
CAMPAIGNS. THANK YOU FOR THAT

04:50:46.729 --> 04:50:48.364
AND IF I HAVEN'T DONE ONE GIVEN

04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:50.332
HOW FIVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR

04:50:50.399 --> 04:50:51.901
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THIS

04:50:58.274 --> 04:51:01.310
PROPOSAL AND ONE UNDERSTAND WHY

04:51:01.377 --> 04:51:03.212
SO FEW HOSPITALS CURRENTLY ARE

04:51:03.279 --> 04:51:07.583
PARTICIPATING. AND REPORTING OF

04:51:07.650 --> 04:51:10.986
THE REPORTING DATA. ARE THEY NOW

04:51:11.053 --> 04:51:13.289
OR WILL THEY BE REQUIRED TO

PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION. THAT

04:51:24.433 --> 04:51:25.801
IS A TOUGH QUESTION AND I'M NOT

04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:28.137
EQUIPPED TO ANSWER MUCH OF THAT

04:51:28.204 --> 04:51:29.872
I CANNOT SPEAK FOR WHY HOSPITALS

04:51:29.939 --> 04:51:32.374
HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO ADOPT THE

04:51:32.441 --> 04:51:34.109
BIOSENSOR ASTON GERMAN

04:51:34.176 --> 04:51:36.045
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM I PROBABLY I

04:51:36.111 --> 04:51:37.513
WILL SAY THAT CALIFORNIA DOES

04:51:37.580 --> 04:51:38.914
HAVE MANDATORY MANDATED

04:51:38.981 --> 04:51:40.749

MANDATED PROGRAM IT IS SOMETHING

04:51:44.353 --> 04:51:45.855
THAT IS OPTIONAL THE HOSPITALS

04:51:45.921 --> 04:51:48.123
CAN OPT INTO AND CALIFORNIA IS A

04:51:48.190 --> 04:51:49.725
LARGE STATE WITH A NUMBER OF

04:51:49.792 --> 04:51:51.026
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS IN A

04:51:51.093 --> 04:51:51.961
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HEALTH

OUR HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY

04:51:56.232 --> 04:51:58.367
DEPARTMENTS I WOULD SAY IT IS A

04:51:58.434 --> 04:51:59.168
BIT EASIER FOR SOME STATES TO

04:51:59.235 --> 04:52:00.936
ONBOARD ON TO THE CLASS AND

04:52:01.003 --> 04:52:04.306
SYSTEM THAT IT IS FOR CALIFORNIA

04:52:04.373 --> 04:52:05.541
. WHAT ARE AND- BUT MY

04:52:05.608 --> 04:52:07.810
UNDERSTANDING IS CALIFORNIA'S

04:52:07.877 --> 04:52:10.846
THE LAST STATE TO. IMPLEMENT AND

04:52:10.913 --> 04:52:12.715
GET ON TO BIOSENSING THAT

04:52:12.781 --> 04:52:15.251
CURRENTLY. WORK LESS THAN FIFTY

04:52:15.317 --> 04:52:17.686
HOSPITALS OUT OF OVER THREE

04:52:17.753 --> 04:52:18.854
HUNDRED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN

DEPARTMENTS. AS I BELIEVE IT

04:52:31.634 --> 04:52:33.469
WILL THEN ALLOW US TO BE MORE

04:52:33.535 --> 04:52:36.605

THERE IS A HIDDEN GEM HERE FOR

04:53:08.037 --> 04:53:10.639
US TO BE FOCUSING ON. AS WE PARK

04:53:10.706 --> 04:53:12.174
HEARD ABOUT THE NEED FOR

WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS. THEY

04:53:14.410 --> 04:53:17.279
SPOKE TO THE ABILITY FOR US TO

LOOK TOWARDS A LOW COST AND HIGH

04:53:19.048 --> 04:53:20.916

IMPORTANCE OF PEER SPECIALISTS.

04:53:26.055 --> 04:53:27.489
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:53:27.556 --> 04:53:29.058
LOOK TOWARDS ARE YOU TO LOOK

04:53:29.124 --> 04:53:30.392
TOWARDS THOSE WITH LIVED

EXPERIENCED AND TURN IT INTO

04:53:36.598 --> 04:53:37.933
LEARNING BROTHER STUDENTS

04:53:38.000 --> 04:53:40.235
EMPOWERS THEM. IT ALLOWS OTHER

I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT

04:53:57.686 --> 04:53:59.989
FOR US AS A STATE TO DO TO MAKE

04:54:00.055 --> 04:54:00.756

QUESTION OF ACCESSIBILITY IS

05:13:02.597 --> 05:13:06.234
STILL AN ISSUE- I THINK BACK TO

05:13:06.300 --> 05:13:07.135
TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

ALONE TO FEND FOR MYSELF THE

05:13:33.761 --> 05:13:34.729
PROBLEM WASN'T THAT MY SCHOOL

05:13:34.795 --> 05:13:36.664
DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT BUT IT WAS

05:13:36.731 --> 05:13:37.899
THAT THEY CAN OFFER THE SERVICES

05:13:37.965 --> 05:13:39.233
THEY NEEDED BECAUSE OF FUNDING

05:13:39.300 --> 05:13:40.902

BODY AND SOUL. FOR MY FAMILY WAS

05:13:50.945 --> 05:13:52.180
ALL OF THE ABOVE AND I REMEMBER

05:13:52.246 --> 05:13:55.650
FALLING. INTO DEPRESSION BEING

05:13:55.716 --> 05:13:56.584

ATTEMPTS AND SUICIDAL IDEATION.

05:17:04.905 --> 05:17:06.307

05:17:10.077 --> 05:17:12.113
WONDERFUL COUNSELOR WHO EVEN

WITHOUT ME EXPLICITLY SAYING SO

05:17:13.714 --> 05:17:15.282

THE TREATMENT INSIDE THOSE

05:23:08.769 --> 05:23:11.538
FACILITIES. IS DEHUMANIZING. AND

05:23:11.605 --> 05:23:14.675
ABUSIVE. I'M IN NO CHILD NO

THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SUICIDAL

05:23:26.787 --> 05:23:29.256
THOUGHTS. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID

05:23:29.323 --> 05:23:30.290
OF BEING PLACED UNDER FIFTY ONE

05:23:30.357 --> 05:23:31.959

AFRAID OF EXPERIENCING. YOU KNOW

05:23:34.061 --> 05:23:37.064
THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT

OCCURS INSIDE THOSE FACILITIES.

05:23:38.198 --> 05:23:39.299
WE NEED A TRANSITION TO

05:23:39.366 --> 05:23:41.568
COMMUNITY BASED CARE TO NOT ONLY

05:23:41.635 --> 05:23:44.071
REDUCE THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT-

05:23:44.138 --> 05:23:46.106

HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS

NEED TO BE ESSENTIAL NODES IN

06:07:55.353 --> 06:07:56.921
THAT SYSTEM SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

06:07:56.988 --> 06:07:59.424
AREN'T HAVING TO NAVIGATE. A

06:07:59.490 --> 06:08:00.391

THEY LIVE IN SAN DIEGO. THEY'RE

06:08:07.031 --> 06:08:09.434

06:08:09.500 --> 06:08:10.701
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE

06:08:10.768 --> 06:08:13.004
SEAMLESS CARE THAT IS INTEGRATED

06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:15.139
AND COORDINATED REGARDLESS IF

THEY'RE ON CAMPUS OR AT HOME.

06:08:16.941 --> 06:08:17.909
TRANSITIONING BETWEEN WHAT'S

06:08:17.975 --> 06:08:20.912

POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS IN THAT

06:08:24.482 --> 06:08:26.484
REGARD BUT THE PANDEMIC AND

06:08:26.551 --> 06:08:28.219
OTHER CHALLENGES REALLY HAVE

06:08:28.286 --> 06:08:30.288
SHORT CIRCUITED THE OPPORTUNITY

06:08:30.354 --> 06:08:31.389
TO SIT DOWN WITH OUR SYSTEM

06:08:31.456 --> 06:08:32.890
PARTNERS. AND OUR COUNTY

06:08:32.957 --> 06:08:34.258
PARTNERS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO

06:08:34.325 --> 06:08:36.427
CREATE THAT SEAMLESS SYSTEM.

06:08:36.494 --> 06:08:37.528
THAT BEGINS WITH THE NEEDS OF

06:08:37.595 --> 06:08:40.865
OUR STUDENTS. N. AND RECOGNIZES

ENVIRONMENT AND THAT THE COLLEGE

06:08:45.203 --> 06:08:47.705
IS A POINT IN TIME. IN THE IN

06:08:47.772 --> 06:08:49.540
THE LIFESPAN OF A STUDENT. AND

06:08:49.607 --> 06:08:51.209
SO A YOUNG PERSON WHO SERVED IN

06:08:51.275 --> 06:08:52.376
A COUNTY THAT MOVES ON TO A

06:08:52.443 --> 06:08:54.378
CAMPUS PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE OF

06:08:54.445 --> 06:08:55.213
THEIR COUNTY SHOULD HAVE A

06:08:55.279 --> 06:08:56.614
CONTINUITY OF CARE AND WHEN THEY

06:08:56.681 --> 06:08:58.950

THAT THAT CARE DOES ISN'T

06:09:01.919 --> 06:09:03.888
DROPPED. AND THEN RESTARTED BUT

06:09:03.955 --> 06:09:06.090
IT'S THAT SEAMLESS FLOW THROUGH

06:09:06.157 --> 06:09:08.159
A PUBLIC SYSTEM OR WITH SUPPORT

06:09:08.226 --> 06:09:09.961
FROM THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. THAT IS

06:09:10.027 --> 06:09:12.230

RISK FOR NEGATIVE OUTCOMES.

06:13:06.363 --> 06:13:08.132
BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF ALL AN HSA

06:13:08.199 --> 06:13:09.934
FUNDING IS TARGETED TO SUPPORT

06:13:10.000 --> 06:13:12.670

COUNTIES ARE PROUD OF THE WORK

06:13:18.242 --> 06:13:19.477
WE'VE DONE TO BUILD OUT A

06:13:19.543 --> 06:13:20.711
NETWORK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS

06:13:20.778 --> 06:13:22.279
SPECIALTY CARE PROGRAMS

06:13:22.346 --> 06:13:24.715
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PRIMARILY

06:13:24.782 --> 06:13:25.983
FUNDED THROUGH AN HSA

06:13:26.050 --> 06:13:27.818

A PROGRAM HAS BEEN SET UP IT CAN

06:13:31.989 --> 06:13:33.624
SUBSEQUENTLY BE SUPPORTED TO

06:13:33.691 --> 06:13:35.426
SOME DEGREE WITH MEDIC HOW

06:13:35.493 --> 06:13:38.028
FEDERAL MATCH AS WELL. ALTHOUGH

06:13:38.095 --> 06:13:40.097
NEEDS TO GO FAR BEYOND OUT I'M

06:13:40.164 --> 06:13:42.433
SIGNIFICANT GAPS DO ACTUALLY

06:13:42.500 --> 06:13:43.968
EXIST IN MOST COUNTIES FOR

06:13:44.034 --> 06:13:45.069
INDIVIDUAL WITH COMMERCIAL

06:13:45.136 --> 06:13:47.571
COVERAGE SO PARITY CONTINUES TO

06:13:47.638 --> 06:13:49.507
BE AN ISSUE. COUNTIES MAYES

06:13:49.573 --> 06:13:51.142
CIRCLES INDIVIDUALS IF FUNDING

06:13:51.208 --> 06:13:52.710
IS AVAILABLE BUT WITH THE MANY

06:13:52.777 --> 06:13:54.678
COMPETING PRIORITIES HIGHLIGHTED

06:13:54.745 --> 06:13:56.647
TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR

06:13:56.714 --> 06:13:58.616
COMMERCIAL PLAN PARTNERS ALSO

06:13:58.682 --> 06:14:00.451
INVEST THEIR RESOURCES IN

06:14:00.518 --> 06:14:02.086
BUILDING UP THESE PROGRAMS. SO

06:14:02.153 --> 06:14:03.554
TODAY MORE THAN THIRTY COUNTIES

06:14:03.621 --> 06:14:05.389
HOW BUILT OUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS

06:14:05.456 --> 06:14:07.391
PROGRAMS ON THE REASONS THAT WE

06:14:07.458 --> 06:14:09.226
DO NOT YET HAVE EARLY PSYCHOSIS

06:14:09.293 --> 06:14:11.562
PROGRAMS IN EVERY COUNTY IS THAT

06:14:11.629 --> 06:14:13.030
THESE PROGRAMS REALLY ARE HIGHLY

06:14:13.097 --> 06:14:15.032
SPECIALIZED. AND AS WITH

06:14:15.099 --> 06:14:16.433
SPECIALTY CARE AND PHYSICAL

06:14:16.500 --> 06:14:18.469
HEALTH IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO

06:14:18.536 --> 06:14:20.638
BUILD OUT SPECIALTY PROGRAMS IN

06:14:20.704 --> 06:14:23.007
SPARSELY POPULATED COMMUNITIES

06:14:23.073 --> 06:14:24.675
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST AND THE

06:14:24.742 --> 06:14:26.377
NEED TO ATTACK ATTRACT THE RIGHT

06:14:26.443 --> 06:14:28.312
KIND OF WORK WORK FORCE TO RURAL

06:14:28.379 --> 06:14:30.214
COMMUNITIES. OR REGIONS WITH

06:14:30.281 --> 06:14:32.883
SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES

06:14:32.950 --> 06:14:36.387
I'M FOR EXAMPLE THE LOWER SAN

06:14:36.453 --> 06:14:37.388
JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION OF OUR

06:14:37.454 --> 06:14:38.422
STATE. THAT SAID OUR WORLD

06:14:38.489 --> 06:14:40.124
COUNTIES DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN

06:14:40.191 --> 06:14:42.393
BUILDING OUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS

06:14:42.459 --> 06:14:44.662
PROGRAMS IF THEY CAN BE ADAPTED

06:14:44.728 --> 06:14:47.164
TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. I DO

06:14:47.231 --> 06:14:48.899
WANNA MENTION TELEHEALTH HAS

06:14:48.966 --> 06:14:50.434
BEEN A CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR

06:14:50.501 --> 06:14:52.136
THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE

06:14:52.203 --> 06:14:54.572

TELEHEALTH. IT IS HOWEVER A

06:14:57.474 --> 06:14:59.777
COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT ALL

06:14:59.844 --> 06:15:02.146
YOU CAN OR WANT TO ENGAGE VIA

06:15:02.213 --> 06:15:03.681
TELEHEALTH. WELL IT IS

06:15:03.747 --> 06:15:06.517
ABSOLUTELY AN IMPORTANT TOOL IS

06:15:06.584 --> 06:15:07.651
ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS

06:15:07.718 --> 06:15:09.687
NOT TO OVERSTATE. IF YOU

06:15:09.753 --> 06:15:12.223
CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE

06:15:12.289 --> 06:15:14.225

06:15:16.427 --> 06:15:17.661
WOULD LIKELY HEAR A STRONGER

06:15:17.728 --> 06:15:19.663
PREFERENCE FOR TELEHEALTH. BUT

06:15:19.730 --> 06:15:20.564
THE VOICE OF YOUTH WITH

06:15:20.631 --> 06:15:22.466
ALTERNATE PREFERENCES WOULD BE

06:15:22.533 --> 06:15:25.703

FUNDING SOURCES SINCE SO MUCH OF

THE FUNDING OF THE CHILDREN YOU

06:29:55.138 --> 06:29:56.172
HAVE A HEALTH ISSUE IS BILLY

06:29:56.239 --> 06:29:58.108
CATALYTIC IN TERMS OF BUILDING.

06:29:58.174 --> 06:30:00.577
A SYSTEM I THINK WE'RE IN THE

06:30:00.643 --> 06:30:03.913
PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER

06:30:03.980 --> 06:30:05.615

FOLLOW UP IN AND THIS MAY GO TO

06:30:07.884 --> 06:30:10.520
A J. C. COOPER. WE HEARD FROM A

06:30:10.587 --> 06:30:12.188
FEW PANELISTS REGARDING E. P. S.

06:30:12.255 --> 06:30:14.491
D. T. WHICH STOPS AT TWENTY ONE

06:30:14.557 --> 06:30:15.525
AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE

06:30:15.592 --> 06:30:18.228
ADMINISTRATION. FOR EXTENDING

06:30:18.294 --> 06:30:19.395
THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH

06:30:19.462 --> 06:30:21.131
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE UP

06:30:21.197 --> 06:30:23.199
TO THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE. BUT

06:30:23.266 --> 06:30:24.868
I'D LIKE TO GET THE

06:30:24.934 --> 06:30:26.970
ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ON.

06:30:27.036 --> 06:30:29.706
THAT SUGGESTION OF INCREASING IT

06:30:29.773 --> 06:30:31.508
UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE.

06:30:31.574 --> 06:30:33.510
FIRST SO I THINK THE REAL REASON

06:30:33.576 --> 06:30:35.645
WHY THE INITIATIVE WAS EXTENDED

06:30:35.712 --> 06:30:36.579
TO TWENTY FIVE IS BECAUSE

06:30:36.646 --> 06:30:39.215
INDIVIDUALS CAN BE ON THERE- YOU

06:30:39.282 --> 06:30:41.584
KNOW. HELP COVERAGE IT INTEL

06:30:41.651 --> 06:30:42.952
ESSENTIALLY THAT TIME PERIOD SO

06:30:43.019 --> 06:30:45.021
MAKING SURE THAT- WHERE THE

HEALTH COVERAGE IS. EXTENDED YOU

06:30:48.124 --> 06:30:50.026
KNOW ALL THE WAY TO THE AGE OF

06:30:50.093 --> 06:30:50.560
TWENTY SIX I THINK THAT'S

06:30:50.627 --> 06:30:52.162
ULTIMATELY WHY WE ENDED UP TYING

06:30:52.228 --> 06:30:54.330
TO THE TWENTY FIVE- INSTEAD OF

06:30:54.397 --> 06:30:57.033
JUST TWENTY ONE- THERE ARECLEAR

06:30:57.100 --> 06:30:58.635
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES FOR

06:30:58.701 --> 06:31:00.270
WHERE THE CUT OFF IS RIGHT

06:31:00.336 --> 06:31:01.171
DEPENDING ON WHICH AGES THAT

06:31:01.237 --> 06:31:02.672
YOU'RE LOOKING AT- AND JUST A

06:31:02.739 --> 06:31:05.141
REMINDER EEST T. ONLY APPLIES TO

06:31:05.208 --> 06:31:07.744
THE MEDICAID POPULATION. AND

06:31:07.811 --> 06:31:11.815
THIS INITIATIVE IS FOR I. ZERO

06:31:11.881 --> 06:31:12.582
TO TWENTY FIVE FOR ALL PAYERS

06:31:12.649 --> 06:31:13.850
AND SO DIDN'T WANTED TO

06:31:13.917 --> 06:31:15.185
NECESSARILY BE BUILT AROUND JUST

06:31:15.251 --> 06:31:17.253
THE MEDICAID. PROGRAM BUT ALSO

06:31:17.320 --> 06:31:18.888
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING

06:31:18.955 --> 06:31:20.223
ACROSS THE BROAD HEALTHCARE

06:31:20.290 --> 06:31:22.392
COVERAGE- TRIGGER POINT SINCE

06:31:22.458 --> 06:31:24.093

OTHER QUESTIONS OFFLINE IF I CAN

ACCESSIBLE TO. HIGHER EDUCATION

06:31:41.311 --> 06:31:44.180
STUDENTS BOTH WITHIN THE UC CSU

06:31:44.247 --> 06:31:46.683
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HAVE

06:31:46.749 --> 06:31:49.552
THEIR FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND

06:31:49.619 --> 06:31:52.722
WILL KNOW WHO IS. QUALIFIED FOR

06:31:52.789 --> 06:31:55.124

THE POINT I'M TRYING TO. MAKE IS

06:32:23.119 --> 06:32:24.754
THAT WE OFTENTIMES USE THOSE

06:32:24.821 --> 06:32:27.156
FORMULAS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM

06:32:27.223 --> 06:32:29.359
