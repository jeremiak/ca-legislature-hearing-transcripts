MYSELF TO REDUCE RISKS AT

SHORTENING THE PERIOD OF TIME.

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:30.120

BROKERS TO DO BOTH OF THOSE

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.260
THINGS. BY ALLOWING BIKE RIDERS

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.595
TO RETAIN A MODEST AMOUNT OF

TO MOVING AND STATIONARY

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.942
OBJECTS AND IT'S ALSO EASIER.

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.777
FOR DRIVERS TO SEE THINGS

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:54.678
BETTER FOR THEM THAN ON THEIR

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:57.114
SIDE. BIKE RIDERS ALSO REDUCE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:57.848
THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL TIME

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:59.450

FIRST CONSIDER THIS LAW YEARS

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.287

IDAHO STOP AND OUR MOTIVATION

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:22.092
WAS PROBABLY SIMILAR TO THEIRS

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.327
AT THE TIME WHEN THEY

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:25.195
INTRODUCED IT TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.230
YOU COULD SAY THOSE ARE

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.998
CONSERVATIVE VALUES LET'S GET.

MAKE THEIR OWN COMMON SENSE AND

SAFE DECISIONS. BUT AS WE DUG

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.876
DEEPER THIS YEAR WE CONSIDERED

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.978

EVERYONE TAKING THEIR TURN AT

THE INTERSECTION. BUT WHEN WE

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.152
DISCOVERED HOW THIS WILL

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:49.853
IMPROVE SAFETY WE CALL IT THE

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.588
SAFETY STUFF. AND THAT'S WHAT

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.956
IT'S CALLED ALL OVER THE

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.358

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.395

I HONESTLY EXPECTED JUST TO SEE

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.938
NO. MORE DANGER I EXPECTED IT

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.374
TO STAY THE SAME. AND IN FACT

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.341
EVERYWHERE THIS LAW HAS BEEN

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.310
PASSED. THERE'S NO SAFETY

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.312

CRASHES WE HAVE AT THE

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.884
SEVERE. THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.652
AND THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.721
PEOPLE ARE BOLDLY GOING OUT

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:26.857
THROUGH THE STOP SIGN. WITHOUT

TRAFFIC COMING. WE ARE HAVE

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:36.566
HUNDREDS OF BICYCLE FATALITIES

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:38.201

BRAIN INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.710
THIS BILL WILL INCREASE THE

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:47.911
NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.513
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN CHILDREN

ARE NOT EXPERIENCED AT. HOW FAR

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:54.451
A CAR HAS TO BE AWAY BEFORE WE

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.485
GET TOO OLD WHEN THEY GO

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.287
THROUGH A STOP SIGN. THE

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:59.089
REALITY IS THAT SOME PEOPLE

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:01.224
WILL SLOW UP AS THE AUTHOR HAS

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.226
SAID. AND LOOK AND MAKE SURE

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:05.695
IT'S SAFE. BUT THE REALITY IS

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:07.497
THAT THERE'S MILLIONS OF

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.065

DELIVERY TRUCKS FIRST

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.107
RESPONDERS. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:19.910
THAT. BICYCLE RIDERS THAT WANT

00:51:19.976 --> 00:51:21.511
TO JUST GO THROUGH THE STOP

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.647
SIGN WILL BE FEEL EMBOLDENED.

DO THAT IT IS- SPECIALLY NOT

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:33.223
SAFE FOR CHILDREN. IF THIS BILL

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.058
IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.127
CHILDREN SHOULD BE REMOVED IF

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.162
WE WANT ADULTS TO TRY TO

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:42.065
EXERCISE THIS. THAT'S ONE THING

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.767
BUT ASKING CHILDREN WHO HAVE

TRAFFIC WE SPENT MILLIONS OF

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.440
DOLLARS TEACHING THEM HOW TO.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.843
BE SAFE IN TRAFFIC AND THEN TO

RETINA HD WHEN I'VE SPOKEN AT

YOU'RE AWARE I WAS A SKEPTIC-

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:28.618

SERIOUSLY MR BARROW- AND THE

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.426
PHYSICIANS COMMENTS AND

00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.761
CONCERNS ABOUT CHILDREN WHICH

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.596
WOULD YOU MIND SPEAKING. TO

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:41.898
THEIR CONCERN AND YOU KNOW TO

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.099
THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING A

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.001
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN-

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.636
CHILDREN OR UNDER EIGHTEEN

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:50.340
BICYCLISTS AND THOSE WHO ARE

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:51.975
ADULTS. SURE- I THINK MY

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:53.777
BIGGEST POINT IS THE DATA THAT

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.212
WE'VE HAD. AND ESPECIALLY FROM

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:57.413
DELAWARE SO EVERY SEAT IS

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.748
COLLECTED DATA THE MOST ROBUST

00:56:58.815 --> 00:56:59.883
DATA WE HAVE IS FROM DELAWARE

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:02.552
AND THAT SHOWS A 23% REDUCTION

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.087
BETWEEN BIKE CAR COLLISIONS AT

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:07.290
STOP SIGNS WHEN. LAW LIKE

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:08.458
EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS.

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:12.061
ENACTED AND I AS A MOTHER WOULD

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:12.929
LIKE TO KEEP MY CHILDREN SAFE

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:14.597
TO. AND SO I'VE TAUGHT MY

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.166
CHILDREN MY SON HAS BEEN BIKING

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:17.333
SINCE HE WAS THREE YEARS OLD

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.301
HE'S BEEN BACK INTO SCHOOL

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.336
SINCE HE'S FIVE CROSSING. STOP

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:22.505
SIGNS AT INTERSECTIONS CHILDREN

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:24.140
ARE THEY HERE LEARN YIELDING

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.775
FROM THE TIME WE WOULD TEACH

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:26.476
THEM TO LOOK BOTH WAYS AND

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:28.244
CROSS THE ROAD. THAT'S WHAT WE

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:30.146
DO AS PARENTS WE TEACH THEM TO

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.582
BE SAFE YEAH SO WHEN AS WE GO

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.651
THROUGH. AND WE LOOK AT THIS

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:36.986
YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT IS AN

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:37.620
EIGHTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE OTHER

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:38.688
STATES HAVE NOT DONE AS WE HAVE

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.123
THIS VERY ROBUST STUDY THAT

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.624
WILL COME BACK. THAT WILL SHOW

00:57:41.691 --> 00:57:44.327
US- WHAT THE DATA ON THE SAFETY

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.095
IS BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.597
THAT CHILDREN ARE LESS SAFE AT

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:49.966
INTERSECTIONS. BUT YIELDING

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:50.500
THAN STOPPING AND THERE'S

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:52.402
NOTHING FROM RECRUITING PARENTS

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:53.269
FROM TELLING THEIR CHILDREN

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:54.270
THAT THEY SHOULD STOP RATHER

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:56.039
THAN YIELD RIGHT WE'RE TALKING

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.440
ABOUT MINORS IT'S A PARENTAL

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:58.408
RESPONSIBILITY THE THINK IS

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:00.243
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND EVERY KID

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.412
IS DIFFERENT MY SON ADAM HAS

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:03.346
BEEN READY SINCE HE WAS THREE

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.614
MY DAUGHTER STARTED WRITING

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:05.715
WHEN SHE WAS FIVE. BOTH OF THEM

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:07.317
BUT I CAN BIKE AND WALK TO

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:08.985
SCHOOL. AND THEY GO THROUGH A

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.887
STOP SIGN. AND I'VE TAUGHT MY

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:12.789
CHILDREN TO YIELD BECAUSE WHEN

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.157
THEY'RE ON THE BIKE THEY'RE

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.058
TALLER THEY'RE BIGGER THEY'RE

00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:16.993
MORE VISIBLE WHEN THEY GOT OFF

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.228
THEIR BIKES. THEY ARE NOT

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.630
VISIBLE NEXT TO A CAR. AND SO

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.599
THE SLOW AND THEY EVALUATE THE

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.267
INTERSECTION AND THESE KIDS ARE

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.169
ON THE ROLLED ROAD ANYWAYS. YOU

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:27.737
KNOW THE IDEA THAT KIDS KEEP

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:30.240
KIDS ARE BIKING UNDER SIXTEEN.

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:32.175
I CAN'T FOLLOW TRAFFIC RULES IS

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.810
THAT THE FAULT OF THE PARENTS

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.011
WHO HAVEN'T TAUGHT THEM HOW TO

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.546
STAY SAFE. SO I DO THINK THAT

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.548
IS A PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:40.617
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN EIGHTY

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.251
ONE TWENTY TWO THAT WOULD MAKE

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:42.752
CHILDREN LESS SAFE IN FACT IT

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.754
MAKES THEM SAFER. AND I

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:45.688
APPRECIATE THAT I WOULD JUST

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.090
ADD FOR THE RECORD THAT BY THE

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.458
FIVE YEAR OLD SHE HAS NO COMMON

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:51.527
SENSE WHATSOEVER. SHE SHOULD BE

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:53.263
BACK TO SCHOOL. MAYBE SHOULD

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:55.999
HAVE BETTER BETTER PARENTING- I

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:56.933

WAY INTERSECTION. HOW DOES THIS

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.722

ONE OF THOSE BIKES MUST YIELD

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:23.192
THEY CANNOT BLOW THROUGH AS

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.828

NOW ASSISTANCE TO THE SAFETY

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:05.001
STOP DOES NOT CHANGE THE NUMBER

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:05.568
YOUR RULES OF GILDING

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:07.103

KNOW EVIDENCE AND OTHER STATES

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.319
SHOWS THAT THIS INCREASES

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.221
SAFETY. I MEAN WHAT ARE OUR

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.423

SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.300
CHAIR- I ALSO. WANT TO EXPRESS

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:38.534
MY CONCERN SO YOU KNOW I'VE

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.203
BEEN. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:41.838
AUTHOR ABOUT MY CONCERNS THAT

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.272
SAFETY CONCERNS FOR CHILDREN

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:46.142
AND I ALREADY- YOU KNOW I WANT

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.343
TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:49.445
HERE I BELIEVE MR- REQUEST

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.414
SOMEONE THAT EXPRESSED MY

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.784
CONCERNS. ARE NO MORE LINES WAY

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:58.855
BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AND EVEN

01:00:58.921 --> 01:00:59.689
COMING TO THE FLOOR HAD

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.257
CONCERNS AND I HAD TO EXPRESS

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.959
THEM TO THE AUTHOR BUT WHEN I

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.594
HEAR COMMENTS LIKE YOU KNOW

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.329
IT'S PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:07.663
IT'S THE PARENTS FAULT IF THEY

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:10.767
DON'T KNOW HOW TO. CROSS I

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.235
THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT HERE

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:13.436
BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.038
ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY CHILD

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.105
GROWS UP WITH THE BICYCLE AND

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.007
THEY DON'T THAT EVERY PARENT IS

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.742
OUT BICYCLING WITH THEIR

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.245
CHILDREN ARE AVID BICYCLIST AND

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.680
THAT'S NOT THE REALITY THERE'S

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.082
SOME HOMES WHERE CHILDREN HAVE

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.950
NEVER SEEN A BIKE AND THEY'RE

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.919
ONLY ABLE TO USE IT OUTSIDE

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:32.055
WHEN THERE'S FRIENDS AND- AGAIN

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:32.955
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.457
DISCONNECT HERE BECAUSE NOT

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.658
EVERY CHILD HAS A BIKE NOT

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.293
EVERY CHILD CAN AFFORD A BIKE.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.362
AND NOT EVERY PARENT IS OFTEN

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.396
ENOUGH TO HAVE A BIKE AND

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.331
BICYCLE EVERYTHING- IF WE CAN

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:44.434
WITH THEIR CHILDREN SO I DO

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.602
WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.838
CONSIDER WHAT SOME AT THE

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.973
OPPOSITIONIST SAYING ABOUT THE

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.143
YOUNGER CHILDREN PERHAPS NOT

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.978
EIGHTEEN BUT YOU KNOW FOURTEEN

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.447
OR LESS FIFTEEN OR LESS I THINK

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:58.948
THAT THERE IS A REAL CONCERN

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:01.217

SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.053
RESERVATIONS BECAUSE I KNOW

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.924
THIS BUT IT IS VALID I DO WANT

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.125

THOSE HAD SPOKE IN OPPOSITION

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.894

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.663
CONCERNS AND I KNOW THAT IT

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:14.597
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:15.765
THE PROCESS AND I HOPE THAT

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.467

AUTHOR IS TRYING TO MAKE IT A

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.878
SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR CYCLISTS

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:32.381
OUT THERE. BUT I. DO HAVE GREAT

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:36.018
CONCERN ABOUT. CHILDREN IN THIS

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.020
REGARD- AND I KNOW THAT

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.789
ASSEMBLYWOMAN YOU HAVE STATED

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.657
THAT YOU TEACH YOUR CHILDREN

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:42.959
THE RIGHT WAY TO RIDE A BIKE

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.194
AND HOW TO OBEY. THE RULES OF

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:49.265
THE ROAD OUT THERE BUT IF-

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:50.633
FIRST OF ALL NOT EVERY PARENT

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.701
IS TEACHING THEIR KIDS THEIR

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.603
SIN EVEN THOUGH WE MAY SAY WELL

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:54.770
THAT'S BAD PARENTING THAT'S NOT

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.072
GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.073
THEY MAY GET KILLED OUT THERE

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.642
BECAUSE- THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THE

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:01.444
RULES OF THE ROAD SECONDLY. YOU

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:02.912
KNOW IT JUST GET ON TECH TALK

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.113
AND YOU WILL SEE A VARIETY OF

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.781
WAYS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE NOT

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:06.716
DOING THE THINGS THAT THEIR

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:10.186
PARENTS. HAVE TAUGHT THEM SO

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.454
KIDS ARE JUST YOU KNOW THEIR

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:14.690
KIDS THEY'RE NOT AS MATURE. IN

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.292
THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:19.529
SEES AS ADULTS ARE IN A NIGHT.

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.630
I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:22.732
FACT THAT. ANY KID OF ANY AGE

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.433
OUT THERE IN A BICYCLE WE'LL BE

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.601
ABLE TO DO THIS AND THAT WE ARE

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.670
EXPECTING THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.972
DISCERN. WHAT'S SAFE AND WHAT

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:32.775
ISN'T SAFE IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.378
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CARS THAT.

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:37.413
EIGHT I MEAN. THESE KIDS ARE

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.915
GONNA GET KILLED IF THEY DON'T

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.316
MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION AN

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.318
APPARENT ISN'T THERE TO GUIDE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.886
THEM SO IT WOULD BE MY

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:46.455
PREFERENCE IF THE BILL HAD IS

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:47.990
SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW AGE

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:50.459
MINIMUM FOR WHICH TO OBEY THESE

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:51.460
PARTICULAR ROLES I STILL THINK

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:54.230
IT'S- LARGELY CAN BE UNSAFE FOR

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.765
ADULTS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:56.699
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CARS

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:57.900
ARE GOING TO DO IN THE ONCOMING

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.468
TRAFFIC BUT I LEAST THINK WOULD

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:02.972
BE SAFER. IF WE RESTRICTED IT

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.740
TO A CERTAIN AGE RATHER THAN.

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.409
HANGING OUT IN CHILDREN AS

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.644
YOUNG AS THREE APPARENTLY OF

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:10.713
SOME OF HIM WHO ARE ON BICYCLES

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.615
SO I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.717
TRYING TO DO BUT AGAIN SOME OF

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.786
THE STATES THAT WERE USED AS A

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:17.420

CONTRACTED CONGESTION AND I

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:30.066
DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.034
COMPARISON. TO COMPARE IT TO A

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.970
STATE LIKE IDAHO OR SOUTH

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:36.539

GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.767
WHY YOU LOSE YOUR PRIVATE

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.602

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:33.242
ORIGINALLY WAS TAKEN FROM THE

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:36.345
PRIVATE. OWNERS IT WAS DESIGNED

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.080
IT WAS USED FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:41.049
I BELIEVE- AND THAT THAT RIGT

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:43.418
IS JUSTIFIED BUT WE WOULDN'T GO

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:44.520

LANDOWNERS SHOULD HAVE THE

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.140
OPTION TO GET THEIR LAND BACK

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:08.377
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. NOT USED FOR

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.345

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.269
UNDERSTAND THE COMMON SOUNDS

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:35.804
ARE GREAT SENATOR JUST MADE

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.039
ABOUT GIVING IT BACK TO THE

IN MY AREA WE'VE HAD LAND

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.010
THAT'S BEEN SITTING THERE. FOR

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:44.112
R. TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS ON

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:46.114
AND THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO

EXTEND FOR EXAMPLE A FREEWAY

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.818

FAMILIES AROUND THERE HAD

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:52.421
OPPOSITION TO THE FREEWAY SO

PEOPLE THAT NEED HOUSING SO I

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.440
THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO

HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BUILD

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.376

MORE ON REDUCING FINES THAT'S

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:13.153

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I

EXPRESSED HERE ALREADY. BUT I

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.220
YOU KNOW I DO BELIEVE THIS BILL

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.789
IS GOOD INTENTIONS AND I CAN

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:24.658
SEE- BASED ON THE A WITNESS I

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:26.393
SPOKE. OF THE HOMELESS

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.428
GENTLEMAN WHO SAIDTHAT IT

DRIVER'S LICENSE I DO BELIEVE

01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:32.032
THAT. YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD NOT

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:33.200
BE THE CASE WE SHOULD FIGURE

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.468
OUT A WAY WHERE DOES AN IMPACT

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.803
ON SIBLEY TEND TO GET A

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.137
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND DRIVING

GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE-

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.108
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. WE

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:42.943
SHOULD FOCUS ON HAVING SOME

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.179
KIND OF METRICS THAT SAYS. YOU

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:45.946
KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS THE

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.614
ABILITY TO PAY COMPAY AND THOSE

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:48.382
THAT DON'T THERE SHOULD BE

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:51.285
OPTIONS. ARE OUT ON HOW O TAKE

01:39:51.352 --> 01:39:52.853
CARE OF THAT INFECTION WITHOUT.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.455
REALLY HAVING TO BE BOGGED DOWN

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:55.789
WITH DAD WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.191
THAT I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:57.858
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I DO

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:00.594
BELIEVE THAT. IT WILL BE.

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:02.663
EXTREMELY CONFUSING TO ARE YOU

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.631
SENT AGAIN I HAVE TO COME FROM

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:07.668
THE TEACHER PERSPECTIVE AND-

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:08.836
YOU KNOW SYSTEM PRINCIPAL RICE

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.771
ALL SHOWS OF OUR CHILDREN

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.339
CROSSING THE STREETS AT ANY

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:14.074
GIVEN TIME AND YOU KNOW I WAS

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.543
HAVING TO. MONITOR AND I'VE

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:17.644
SEEN MANY COLLISIONS OCCUR

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.980
EVEN. WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO BE

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:22.249
SAFE SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:24.618
WILL SEND MIXED SIGNALS IT'S

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:25.886
REALLY DIFFICULT TO TEACH A

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:28.021
CHILD. YOU KNOW THIS IS BASED

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:29.556
ON WHAT THE BILL STATES I

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:30.791
BELIEVE YOU KNOW I WOULD BE IN

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:31.725
A FRACTION OF THERE'S IMMEDIATE

01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:34.094
HAZARD. VERSUS NOT AND I THINK

01:40:34.161 --> 01:40:35.796
THAT THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR A

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.698
CHILD TO BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND.

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:39.066
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT WE'VE

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:40.768
BEEN TEACHING ALL ALONG YOU

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:41.935
KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO A

01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:44.972
CROSSWALK AND BE SAFE. SO I

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.740
AGAIN AS A TEACHER WHAT I'VE

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:49.143
SEEN IN ALL THE- NEAR MISSES I

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:51.011
THINK THAT THIS IS JUST GOING

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:52.012
TO CONFUSE OUR YOUTH AND I

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:54.081
STILL HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR. OUR

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.450
CHILDREN THAT DON'T HAVE- THE

01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:57.551
MENTAL CAPACITY OF TAKING THE

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:58.619
ONES THAT ARE REALLY YOUNG TO

01:40:58.685 --> 01:40:59.353
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:00.721
DIFFERENCE. SO FOR THOSE

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:02.523
REASONS AT THIS POINT I WILL

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.825

ARE OFTEN LACKLUSTER IN

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.915
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THESE

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.016
ARE THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.918
ARE BEING CONTACTED BY POLICE.

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:33.020
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ISSUES

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.588
OF JAY WALKING. WHERE THEY

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.790
MAYBE WALKING SAFELY IN AN

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:39.927
INTERSECTION. AT TEN. AGAIN

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:41.495
MAKE NO MISTAKE SAFETY IS FIRST

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:42.496
HERE AS AS THE AUTHOR

MENTIONED. THERE IS HARD

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:45.632

BUT THERE'S NO REAL HARD

01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:02.316
EVIDENCE THAT JAY WALKING IS

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:03.884
ATTRIBUTED. TO PEDESTRIAN

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:05.619
INJURIES AND FATALITIES WE
