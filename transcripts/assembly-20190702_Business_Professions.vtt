TO BREAST FEED ARE RIGHT NOW FAR

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.863
TOO MANY WOMEN -- PARTICULARLY --

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.333
OF NEW MOTHERS WHO ARE -- LOWER

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.537
INCOME -- AND DO NOT HAVE SORT

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:28.705

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:31.541

WHERE DO I CONTINUE TO BREAST

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.382
FEED MY CHILD AND DELAY

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:40.284
RETURNING TO WORK -- EITHER ONE

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.118

ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:45.155

THE CHILD.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.425
AND THIS IS A FALSE CHOICE SO

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.394
WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.362
PROVIDES SOME VERY BASIC AND

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.164
STRAIGHTFORWARD REQUIREMENTS --

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.166
TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE ABLE TO

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.702
EXPRESS MILK AT WORK -- THAT

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.604
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IN A

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.205
RESTROOM WHICH IS EXISTING LAW.

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.308
BY EVEN IF WE'RE NOT REQUIRING

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.275
THEM TO IN A RESTROOM SHOULD

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:07.444
NEVER HAVE TO DO -- WE ALSO

00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:09.813
DON'T WANT -- WOMEN TO HAVE TO

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.548
GO AND EXPRESS GOLD IN A BROOM

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.717
CLOSET FOR EXAMPLE SO THE THE

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:16.753
BILL REQUIRES THAT THE EMPLOYER

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.155
PROVIDE A PRIVATE SPACE.

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.589
WE CAN BE A ROOM FOR EMPLOYERS

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.325
WERE ROOM DOESN'T WORK EITHER IS

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:23.160
NO ROOM YOU CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.928
STRUCTURE IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE AND

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.563
HOW THAT IS LAID OUT.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.066
WITH A TABLE WITH A CHAIR --

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.767
WITH AN OUTLET -- AND WITH

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:33.070
NEARBY ACCESS TO REFRIGERATION

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.971
AND RUNNING WATER -- THIS IS NOT

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:37.741
AN EXTREME -- REQUIREMENT -- I

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:40.744
THINK IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO --

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.012
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE -- BRINGING

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.980
FORTH THE NEXT GENERATION OF

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.816
HUMANKIND -- TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:49.786
THEY CAN -- BOTH WORK AND BREAST

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:50.754
FEED.

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:51.588
NOW WE KNOW THAT BREAST FEEDING

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:54.558
HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS --

00:49:54.624 --> 00:50:01.198
FOR FOR BABIES -- AND WE ALSO

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.733
KNOW THAT WHEN WE MAKE IT HARD

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:03.767
FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO WORK

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:06.336
AFTER GIVING BIRTH -- DIED IT

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:07.270
SETS THEM BACK ON WE LOOK AT

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:08.572
DISPARITIES IN PAY AND ALL THE

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:09.573
INEQUITIES GENDER INEQUITIES IN

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:09.940
THE WORKPLACE.

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.608
PART OF THAT IS THAT WE MAKE IT

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:12.909
HARD FOR WOMEN.

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:15.312
AND MOTHERS TO RETURN TO WORK

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:17.247
AND IT HAS A PERMANENT IMPACT

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.282
AND SO THIS WILL HELP TO REDUCE

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.385
THOSE DISPARITIES -- SO I

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:22.986

I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:15.679
I THINK THE AUTHOR SAID CURRENT

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:17.313
LAWS A RESTROOM.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.581
IN THE LAW LAST YEAR SAID THE

LACTATION SPACE HAS TO BE OTHER

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.252

THE BILL LOCATED IN THE LABOR

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.027
CODE AND THE DUPLICATION.

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:32.896
AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION THAT

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:35.465
THOSE -- PROVISIONS COULD CREATE --

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.500
ALL LIMIT MY TESTIMONY TODAY TO

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:37.967
THE BUILDING STANDARDS

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:40.270
REQUIREMENTS -- WE ARE CONCERNED

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:41.604
THAT THE NEW BUILDING STANDARDS

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.972
REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.240
EXPERIENCE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:45.709
ORDINANCE WOULD RESULT IN

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:48.311
BETWEEN THIRTY AND A HUNDRED AND

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:48.912

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:50.947
AND WHILE THE BILL ELIMINATED

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:53.149
THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IT

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.184
SAYS THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.318
ORDINANCE IS THE STARTING POINT

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.553
AND SO WE THINK THAT'S

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:57.654
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.922

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.554
DOES IT HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.957
OTHER.

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:58.428

SPACE AND YOUR AND AND THAT'S

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.227
WHY WE MADE THE BILL FOR THOSE

THERE'S NO BUT WE DIDN'T THERE'S

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.277
NO SPACE IN HERE FOR ANYONE TO
