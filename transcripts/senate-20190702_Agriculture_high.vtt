CONCERNS ABOUT OW LAW

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.427
ENFORCEMENT FEELS ABOUT THIS AND

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:55.628
HOW.

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:56.629
HOW IT'S INTEGRATED WITH THE

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.930
EXISTING SYSTEM AND AND WHETHER

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:58.430
IT?

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.032
PERHAPS OVERWHELMS THE CLIENT

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.400
SYSTEM OR IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.301
THEY'RE ACTUALLY WANTING THAT

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.402
THEY BELIEVE WILL.

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:07.206
STREAMLINE AND HELP I I'M NOT AS

00:15:07.273 --> 00:15:08.874
FAMILIAR WITH HOW THIS WOULD.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.809
WOULD WORK IN A PRACTICAL MATTER

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.778
COULD YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:14.947
ET STARTED TO WHERE YOU'RE

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.249
SAYING THAT A DELIVERY TRUCK.

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:21.287
PERHAPS GETS STOPPED AND IF THE

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:24.556
LOAD MATCHES.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.991
THE LOADED SEND THE SYSTEM THAN

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:26.659
THEY THAT PERSON CAN MOVE ON IS

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:27.693
IT THAT EVERY TIME THERE'S A

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.794
LOAD [inaudible]

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:30.896
THAT IS.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.631
HELLO DIANA PLANS DELIVERY THEN

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.099
THAT WOULD BE IN THE CLASS

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.268
SYSTEM OTHERS ALREADY

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.037
REQUIREMENT THAT DAY.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:38.904
THAT THEY HAVE THE DELIVERY

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.772
LEDGER [inaudible]

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.274
ARM.

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.276
BUT WE HAVE IN FORCE ASSISTANT

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.778
INCORPORATES OFFICERS OUT ON THE

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.279
ROAD CREWS IN ABOUT.

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:50.549
THEY CAN TRACK IT DOWN

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:50.849
[inaudible]

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.687
BUT BUT KNOWING WHAT'S ON THE

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.388
VEHICLE DOES BECOME IMPORTANT OF

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:58.590
POLICING ACCOUNTABILITY AS IT'S

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:00.526
MOVING AROUND THE STATE.

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:08.434
SO WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF A LOT.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.769
I GUESS I THINK.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.671
IT'S SORT OF A GAP IN THE IN THE

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.540
SYSTEM.

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.041
SAY WE WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.710
THERE TO MAKE SURE THE DELIVERY

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:18.277
THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WORKING

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:26.952
WELL -- IT SUPPORTS COMMUNITIES

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.020
TO KNOW THAT WHAT.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.688
IN ON MARIJUANA TRAVéS THEIR

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:30.956
COMMITTEE IS IS UNDER SYSTEM AND

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:35.260
ACCOUNTABILITY -- I DON'T THINK

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.630
THAT THE BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:42.000
CENTER I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.203
ABILITY TO ACCESS.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:47.272
THE DELIVERY DRIVERS OF LEDGER

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.040
SO THEY CAN MATCH UP IF THEY

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.108
HAVE A STOP.

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.709
WE'VE NOT HEARD THAT THAT'S A

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:51.844
PROBLEM NATIONAL FUNDING OF

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.278
PATIENTS.

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:58.250
OUT THERE AVAILABLE -- THERE'S A

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.018
YEAR TO IMPLEMENT.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.954
A YEAH I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HEARD

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.822
ANYTHING FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:05.057
OBJECTING TO IT.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.759
AND I THINK THE COMPELLING IDEA

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.260
IS IT JUST SUPPORTS.

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:10.028
LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY HAVE A

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.463
STOPPING ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.631
THIS IS.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.433
THE LOTUS REPRESENTATIVES BEING

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.335
OUT THERE ON THE STREET AND

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:18.070
THEY'RE OFTEN ON YOUR WAY.

00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:18.604
BUT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.005
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:23.041
FROM DOWN TIME TRYING TO FIGURE

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:23.375
OUT.

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:25.677
DO YOU HAVE WHAT YOU SHOULD.

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:26.945
AB WHAT YOU'VE REPRESENTATIVES.

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.981
THE OBLIGATION TO HAVE A DELIVER

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.117
LEDGER IS ALREADY ON THE CASE.

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:34.052
SO WHAT'S IT THAT'S NOT NEW IT'S

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.454
JUST SUPPORTING THE BILL OF LONG

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.023
FORCE ACCESS.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.793
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A HE KEREN

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:43.262
SO THE NAP BUT WE WE WE'VE NOT

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:44.062
HEARD ANY PROBLEM [inaudible]

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:49.234
AND AS THE CENTER LOSE HAVE BEEN

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:51.203
INVOLVED IN THE MARIJUANA

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.505
DISCUSSION SINCE FIFTEEN SINCE

HE YEAH I HAD I HAVEN'T HEARD OF

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.980
OBJECTION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.816
AND I APPRECIATE YOU BEING AHEAD

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.317
OF OF THIS SAND BEFORE BECOMES A

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.219
PROBLEM AND AND SUGGESTING THIS

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:08.086
PROPOSAL.

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:10.055
I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO BETTER

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.590
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD WORK IN

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:12.925
A WITHIN THE SYSTEM I KNOW FOR

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.660
MYSELF.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.794
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH MISSING

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:18.864
PERSONS CASES AND HAVE HAVE DONE

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:19.798
SOME LEGISLATION DEALING WITH

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:20.933
BACK AND I KNOW THAT WHEN

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.068
SOMEONE GOES MISSING IT GOES

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:26.238
INTO -- A SYSTEM AND THEN IT IS

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.307
ALSO TRANSMITTED TO THE CLASS

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:30.042
SYSTEM WHEN WHEN THERE'S A HIT

00:18:30.108 --> 00:18:31.310
ON SEPT.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:34.680
OR LEAD ON SOMEBODY THAT MAY.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.682
BE MISSING WHO POTENTIALLY IS

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:39.284
FOUND THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:40.452
SUBMITTED TO THE CLASS.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.254
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.389
PROBLEMS WITH -- OLDER MISSING

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.391
PERSONS CASES FOR EXAMPLE WHERE

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.927
THEY WERE NOT PUT INTO THE

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:52.264
SYSTEM AT ALL -- AND SO THERE'S

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.533
SAID.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.767
A GAP N..

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:56.835
OLDER CASES.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.337
NOT BEING IN THE SYSTEMAND

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.439
NEWER CASES BEING IN THE SYSTEM

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:00.706
AND ALSO.

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:02.641
THERE WERE [inaudible]

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.843
REQUIREMENTS THAT.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.178
REQUIRED IN CERTAIN CASES AND

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.679
NOT IN OTHERS AND SO FORTH SO

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.449
IT'S NOT A 1100% GUARANTEED

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.618
SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN RELY ON

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.187
SOMEBODY WHO'S MISSING BEING IN

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:15.521
THAT SYSTEM.

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:17.356
SO WITH THOSE PROBLEMS THAT

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.459
EXIST IT MAKES ME WONDER -- IS

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:21.927
THIS.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.529
TRULY THE PLACE BUT WE SHOULD BE

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.464
TRACKING THIS KIND OF THING AND

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:26.665
I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH.

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.300
ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY END OF OF

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:30.402
WEATHER.

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.438
THAT ACTUALLY IS WORKABLE AND DO

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:34.873
A FULLER WITH CREATING ANOTHER

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.074
SET OF PROBLEMS WELL.

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:40.379
I GUESS THE OVERALL THE RESPONSE

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.080
I HAVE.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:45.684
YOU KNOW I OFTEN.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.319
IT'S FUNNY IS A LAWYER WHEN I

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.555
SIT DOWN AND DRAFT A BILL.

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.623
I DO MY BUILD DRAFT AND I HANDED

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.560
TO PEOPLE LOOK AT BECAUSE IN OUR

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:55.193
BUSINESS BILLS GALLON HAVE TO BE

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.595
BACK.

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.096
IN MY VIEW IS ALWAYS BEEN WELL.

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.232
I'LL TAKE MY DRAFT.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:00.866
AND I LIKE THE WAY I'M DOING IT

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.868
WRONG -- THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT

00:20:02.935 --> 00:20:05.037
NOT AT ALL.

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.104
SOME IS GONNA TAKE A WHACK AT IT

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.639
GOT TO PUT AN IDEA OUT THERE I

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:08.340
THINK.

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:10.375
WE DEFINITELY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.010
THE LEAGUE.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.545
MARKET PLACE.

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.347
LEGAL MARKET PLACE.

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.716
IS THE CONCURRENT EXISTENCE OF

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.585
AN ILLEGAL MARK [inaudible]

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:23.088
AND WE THE GREAT VENTURE OF

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.957
TRYING TO BRING RECREATIONAL

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:26.325
MARIJUANA TO THE MASSES IN

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:27.826
CALIFORNIA.

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.328
IS VERY DEPENDENT UPON HAVING

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:32.297
THE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT LEGAL.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:33.365
AND SORT OF STAMPED DOWN ON

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.934
ILLEGAL.

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.036
AND THE SYSTEM RELIES UPON THE

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:39.504
MOVEMENT OF MARIJUANA AROUND TO

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.706
VENDORS OTHER [inaudible]

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.240
CHANNELS [inaudible]

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.875
SO.

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:45.844
THAT MOVEMENT AND MAKING SURE IT

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.480
IS OF THE LEGAL PRODUCT.

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:49.881
IS ACTUALLY ESSENTIAL TO

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:52.618
CALIFORNIA TRANSITIONING TO A

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.219
HEALTHY MARKET PLACE.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.655
IT TIES INTO TAX REVENUES.

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:59.391
AND NOT HAVING LEAKAGE --

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.425
ILLEGAL.

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:02.561
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF PUBLIC

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:05.130
INTEREST THE CONVERGES UPON.

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.465
THE MOVIE TO MARIJUANA TO THE

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:07.299
SYSTEM.

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.934
AND SUPPORTING [inaudible]

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.902
RELIGION OPERATORS.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:12.904
AND DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL.

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.574
SO I FEEL LIKE.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:17.142
PUT IN A TOOL.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:20.045
IN THE TOOL KIT.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.481
WHICH IS THE ESPECIAL THIS BILL.

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:24.683
ALONG OR SEND REAL TIME.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.984
THEY STOPPED THE VEHICLE TO HAVE

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.419
THE POTENTIAL LOOK UP TO SEE

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:28.587
WHAT TO EXPECT TO FIND IN THIS

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:29.521
VEHICLE.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:31.323
WHAT DO I SEE HERE?

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.424
WHAT DELIVERS HAVE ALREADY MADE

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.159

AS RUNNING ELSE.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.766
IT WILL ALLOW FOR TRAFFIC STOPS

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:42.501
TO BE SEATED MORE PATIENT MANNER.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:46.338
AND ANYBODY WHO'S IN BUSINESS AS

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:47.005

TIME.

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.176

I THINK ULTIMATELY IT UP HOLDS

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.563
THE PUBLIC VALUES OF REGULATED
