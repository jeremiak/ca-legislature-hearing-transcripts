TO I NEED TO ANNOUNCE THAT AB FIFTEEN NINETY ONE BY COOLEY WILL NOT BE HERE TODAY WILL BE HEARD ON JUNE. TWENTY SIX AND I SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE MISTER CALDERON WITH US BUT I SEE MISS WEBER IF WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US. AND BEFORE WE PROCEED I LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT AB TEN SIXTY FIVE BY MISTER BERMAN HAS ALSO BEEN PULLED. AND WILL BE CONSIDERED AT A LATER TIME THANK YOU. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR WEBER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU AND THE THANK YOU FOR HEARING THE BILL. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THEY I HAVE THE PLEASURE PRESENTING A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH CODIFIES AN EXISTING BEST PRACTICE IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY. I CLARIFYING A CONSUMERS RIGHT TO CHOOSE EITHER A CASH PAYMENT OR TO REPAIR THEIR VEHICLE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS FOUND THAT A SMALL HANDFUL OF INSURERS HAVE A QUOTE NO CASH OUT PROVISION IN THEIR CONTRACTS. IF A CONSUMER IS IN AN ACCIDENT THAT CAUSES MODERATE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE THAT CAUSES TWENTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT IT WAS MY MISTAKE I NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM AT THIS TIME SUCH AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND WE WILL. OF KALRA WHEN WE DO HAVE A FULL FORM THANK YOU SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION A PROBLEM NO PROBLEM. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SURE IS A SOUND THAT A SMALL HANDFUL OF INSURERS HAVE A QUOTE NO CASH OUT PROVISION IN THEIR CONTRACT. IF A CONSUMER IS IN AN ACCIDENT CAUSES MODERATE CHANGE TO THE VEHICLE IT COSTS TWO THOUSAND TO REPAIR AND THE CONSUMER HAS A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. THESE INSURANCE WHAT THEY'VE CALLED NO CASH OUT PROVISION REFUSED TO ISSUE THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT IT OWED TO THE CONSUMER UNLESS THEY SHOW PROOF THAT THE REPAIRS ARE BEING MADE -- FORCING SUPPORTING A FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED CONSUMER TO CHOOSE BETWEEN REPAIRING THEIR VEHICLE AND NOT COLLECTING ANY CLAIM PAYMENT AT ALL IS UNFAIR. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING FOR LOW INCOME DRIVERS WHO HAVE DUTIFULLY PAY THEIR PREMIUMS ON TIME WE NOW HAVE THE FUNDS TO COVER THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT A FIRST PARTY AUTOMOBILE PHYSICAL DAMAGE PAYMENT MAY OPT TO RECEIVE A MONETARY PAYMENT BASED ON VALUE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE. IN LIEU OF HAVING THE VEHICLE REPAIR. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND HERE TO SPEAK AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND AB FIFTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS MICHAEL MARTINEZ THE SENIOR. DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. THIS BILL HAS NO HAS RECEIVED NO -- NO VOTES AND HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT'S A MARTINEZ TO SHOOT. WAS THE COMMENT YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. AND THINK THE THE ASSEMBLY ONE FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND AUTHORING THIS MEASURE AND COMMISSIONER LARA IS VERY PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE AND AND ABSOLUTELY WITH BUT THE AUTHOR HAD STATED ABOUT THE BILL. OF SOLDIERS. SUMMER IS IN THIS WAY THAT IT DOES. THERE IS AN EXISTING ENSURE PRACTICE ABOUT WHICH THE NINETY EIGHT POINT 5% OF INSURERS THAT CURRENTLY TO PROVIDE. GIVE CONSUMERS THE OPTION TO CASH OUT THEIR CLAIMS AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HELP TO ENSURE. FOR VERY SMALL HANDFUL OF INSURERS AGAIN LESS ABOUT 2%. THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THESE NO CASH OUT PROVISIONS IN THEIR CONTRACTS. TO TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THE SODA THIS A PRACTICE FOR AGAIN FOR THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF OF INSURANCE THAT ARE PART OF THAT 2%. AND SO WE FEEL ECHOES A LONG WAY IT FOR AN EXISTING BEST PRACTICE. THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THE SET OF AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WITHIN GO A LONG WAY IN HELPING TO ENSURE. DATA A RESTORED PAYMENT IN CASES OF SUSPECTED FRAUD THERE'S ALSO -- ALLOWS ENSURE TO INCLUDE THE LOST PAY OR LIEN HOLDER AS AN ADDITIONAL PAY HE ON THE CONSUMERS CLAIM PAYMENT AS WELL AS A THIRD SET OF AMENDMENTS. THAT TO MAKE CLEAR THA INSURERS CAN REQUIRE A DAMAGED VEHICLE TO BE REPAIRED. IN CASES WHERE THE VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES THAT ARE PART OF VEHICLES OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED TO FILL THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AS WELL. ALL AROUND AND SO WITHOUT ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SOME. CAN YOU GET TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SCENE NINE IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. HEY SEE [inaudible] NINE IS -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYBODY WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS. WE DO HAVE. OKAY SEE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS ON THIRTY WEBER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE REALLY WHAT IT JUST SIMPLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WE'RE LISTENING TO US TODAY AND BILL TO A SIGNIFICANT. POPULATION NOT ALWAYS THE LARGEST POPULATION BUT IT'S A FAIR AND HONEST BILL THAT THIS SHOULD BE OFFERED TO INDIVIDUALS AND AS POINTED OUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN MAKE IT EVEN STRONGER AND FAIRFIELD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE BUT WHEN YOU GET A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT BALANCES. PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS AS WELL AS TAKE THE INDUSTRY INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S PROTECTION FOR FRAUD. AS YOU CAN SEE WERE STILL LACKING A QUORUM SO WE'LL PUT THIS PHONE CALL AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE'LL EMAIL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE YOU FOR BEING HERE. MISTER CALDERON HERE. SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE A REALLY SHORT RECESS UNFORTUNATELY I SEE MR STEINBERG CALDERON HERE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO BILL AB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALDERON WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TAKE THE SUGGEST A COMMITTEE MEMON CINEMA THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING ME MY OFFICE -- IN TWENTY THIRTY IS PROJECTED THAT CALIFORNIANS OVER THE A. SIXTY FIVE WILL BECOME A LARGER SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN CHILDREN. UNDER EIGHTEEN MORE THAN HALF OF THIS POPULATION WILL NEED LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AT SOME POINT YET THERE IS NO SUSTAINABLE. OPTION FOR SENIORS. WITH AND AND WITH SENIORS WITH COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND THERE'S NO REAL OPTION FOR THEM TO OBTAIN A FORMAL LONG TERM CARE SERVICES -- MIDDLE CLASS SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO SPEND ON THEIR ASSETS IN ORDER TO PAY. FOR OR EXHAUST THEIR PERSONAL AFTER THE ASSETS AND PAYING DRIVING EXPERIENCE WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE HAD ALZHEIMER'S LIKELY YOU KNOW SHE WAS A RIVETER -- DURING YOU KNOW THE WAR AND AND SO SHE STICKS. ARE SAVED A LOT OF HER MONEY WAS ABLE TO HELP IN THOSE IN PAYING FOR THOSE COSTS BUT WAS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. BECAUSE OF THIS AND I'M OFFERING THIS BILL -- TO ESTABLISH A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TASK FORCE CONVENED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER NOW EVER SINCE I GOT ELECTED I'VE WORKED A LOT ON THESE ISSUES. WHEN IT COMES A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE I'VE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE I VERY MUCH SEEN LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE? I LONG TERM SURE A CARE -- NOW SERVICES AS BEING A MILLENNIAL ISSUE AND THE REASON WHY IS THAT MY PARENTS MY AND MY PARENTS GENERATION MY GENERATION'S PARENTS ARE THE ONES THAT SUFFERED THROUGH THE RECESSION AND SO FOR EXAMPLE MY MOTHER MY STEPFATHER BUSINESS OWNERS. THEY LOST EVERYTHING NOT ONLY DID THEY LOSE OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OF THE RECESSION ALSO LOST THEIR HOME. AND IN THAT PROCESS TRYING TO KEEP THE BUSINESS ALIVE THEY SPEND DOWN ALL THEIR ASSETS ALL THE RETIREMENT. ABSOLUTELY EVERY SINGLE PENNY THEY HAD BECAUSE THERE WAS NO IT WASN'T CLEAR HOW LONG THE RECESSION IS GOING TO LAST SO THAT THAT THEY COULD PROP IT UP. AND RECOUP THAT MONEY LATER ON BUT THE RECESSION WAS SO LONG THAT THEY ENDED UP LOSING EVERYTHING -- ACTUALLY OTHER. YOUR THEIR SENATOR. CENTER BATES AND SO. YOU KNOW THE TIME. WE LOST PROVIDERS FOR LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE OVER A HUNDRED PROVIDERS A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH WOULD HELP. MITIGATE THE COST OF IT NOW THERE'S TEN PROVIDERS OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE ENERGY ATTENDED. TWELVE SO THE COSTS ARE HIGHER IT'S AND ALTERNATELY THE PROBLEM IN THE REASON WHY CHARACTERIZES IS VERY MUCH MILLENNIAL ISSUE IS THAT THOSE COSTS IN THOSE BURNS ARE GONNA FALL UPON ME IN MY GENERATION. WHEN WORD WE HAVE MOUNTAINS OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT EVEN WHEN WE GO TO COLLEGE ARE STILL ONLY GREAT GETTING A MINIMUM WAGE JOBS NOT BEING ABLE TO REALLY COVER ON COSTS? HAVING MOVED BACK IN WITH THOSE PARENTS WERE REALLY NOT SUITABLE SUITED TO TAKE ON THOSE COSTS. OF PROVIDING SERVICES IN IN THE EVENT THAT ONE OF OUR PARENTS ARE GONNA NEED THOSE SERVICES AND SELL. I WANT TO SET UP THIS TASK FORCE. THAT IT IS CONVENE BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO PROVIDE EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSION OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR ON COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM. IN CALIFORNIA -- SO GIVEN YOU KNOW THE GROWING RECOGNITION OF CALIFORNIA'S DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS. IT'S WE SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO TRY TO SUCCESSFUL PATH TO LONG TERM CARE. STABILITY THAT SOME OF THE MOTIVATION THIS WILL. DO IS JUST TRYING TO ESTABLISH A WAY THAT WE CAN CAN I GET THIS. ARE GOING ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S RELIABILITY ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR MOVING FORWARD WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. WITH WE CREATE A PROGRAM WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE -- AND I THINK A TASK FORCE IS WHERE WE NEED TO START BECAUSE HOW CAN WE MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDING AN ISSUEAND THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS DELORES AROUND FLOOR AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IT ALL COME IN THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR NUMBERS AGAIN I'M TO LARA STRAND FLORES WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. AND WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE SIX SEVEN TRAGEDY CAN STRIKE AT ANY TIME AND ANYONE CAN FIND THEM SEE THEIR SELVES INDEED OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH CAN BE DEVASTATING FINANCIALLY. THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS A BIG CONCERN FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AND OTHER WORKING FAMILIES -- MY MEMBERS EARN ON AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FULL TIME WORK AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR PART TIME WORK. AFTER PAYING FOR BASIC LIVING EXPENSES AND HEALTH CARE INSURANCE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS SIMPLY OUT OF REACH FOR THEM [inaudible] ALMOST. THE MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERS LONG TERM CARE. WHEN WORKERS AND THEIR LOVED ONES CAN NO LONGER CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND ARE EXPOSED TO THE HIGH COST OF NURSING CARE THEIR SHOT? AND THEY'RE AFRAID. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TO EXCEED SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO PAY NOT EVEN FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS WITHOUT WIPING OUT THEIR SAVINGS. AND OTHER ASSETS. AFTER THEY HAVE NOTHING IN THEIR SAVINGS THEY SELL THEIR HOME THEY SELL THEIR CAR. THEY'RE FORCED TO RELY ON THE STATE. AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR CARE. THIS IS WRONG THIS IS UNFAIR IT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER IN LAW AS WELL. AS SEVERAL THOUSAND EVERY MONTH. AND AFTER THREE MONTHS SHE WAS OUT OF ALL OF HER MONEY -- HAD SHE SURVIVED WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DISPOSE OF ALL OF HER ASSETS TO PAY FOR HER LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND WE THINK AB FIVE SIX SEVEN IS A NECESSARY STEP IN THIS PROCESS WE ARE DR. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL MARTINEZ FROM BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND WANT TO THANK. THE ASSEMBLYMAN FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS IS -- A GROWING CONCERN FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. HE'S BEEN TAKING AS THE INCREASING THE AMOUNT. MORE TIME IN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE CAN BE IN. SIX MONTHS AND TO INTO THE POSITION. THAT. HE IS LOOKING AT TO AND BECOMING AN INCREASING CONCERN WITH THE WITH THE HIGH COST OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE RATES ON ON CONSUMERS. AND CLEARLY WHEN WE'VE HEARD -- THE THE THE EXAMPLES OF OF OF THE FROM THE SOME WOMEN AND FROM -- THE PREVIOUS WITNESS THAT TO THE THE PERSONAL IMPACTS THAT THAT TO AND ONE OF MANY TOO MANY STORIES THAT ARE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND NATION. AND SO IT'S IT REALLY IS TODAY CONSUMERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD THESE INCREASE PREMIUMS AND FIND THEMSELVES LEFT WITH TWO CHOICES THAT CAN EITHER. DROP THE POLICY EFFECTIVELY THROWING AWAY YEARS THE PREMIUMS PAID AD POTENTIALLY TURNED A GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID MEDICARE IN CALIFORNIA OR THEY CAN ACCEPT. YOUR BENEFITS. WHICH AMOUNTS TO PAYING MORE FOR LESS NEITHER OPTION HE BELIEVES IS PALATABLE AND SO. THE THE THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT -- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SOMEONE CALDERON NOW IS THE TIME TO TURN THE SISTER AROUND. AND THINK AHEAD BY CREATING PROGRAMS AND PRODUCTS THAT DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF LONG TERM CARE THAT PROVIDES QUALITY CARE. YEARS AND HE BELIEVES THIS TASK FORCE ENVISIONED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE A STRONG FIRST STEP TOWARD BUILDING IN EXPLORING A ROBUST STATEWIDE. PUBLIC LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS ANOTHER NOTE TO A CUT TO THE COMMISSIONER JUST RETURNED FROM A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS MEETING JUST LAST WEEK. ABOUT LTC IN THE WHOLE BULK OF IT WAS LOOKING AT ALL TO SEE ADEQUACY RATES WOULD WE DO WITH ALL OF THESE -- NOW CLOSE BLOCKS WHICH ARE A TERM THAT'S USED -- FOR LTC POLICIES OF POLICIES THAT ARE NO LONGER SOLD. BUT THEY'RE STILL ON THE BOOKS AND THERE IS A A THOUSANDS OF POLICY HOLDER STILL THAT ARE STARTING OUR CONTINUE TO SEE. IS DOUBLE DIGIT DIGIT INCREASES AND SO. IT IS A HUGE QUANDARY NATIONWIDE FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS ABOUT THE NATION OF WHAT TO DO WITH THESE CLOTHES BOX A BUSINESSES WELL AS TO CONTINUE BECAUSE UNDER THIS COMMISSIONER HE CERTAINLY WANTS. TO TO INCENTIVIZE AND HAVE OF REVIEW AND APPROVE NEWER PRODUCTS FOR PLACEMENT ON THE MARKET AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE. MORE LONG TERM CARE. PRODUCTS THAT HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TO PROVIDE SO AGAIN BRINGING BACK TO THIS BILL. IS THAT TO THE COMMISSION IS VERY PROUD AND SUPPORTING THIS BILL IT INSTANTLY WILL GO A LONG WAY. I'M AND ALSO VERY -- REMISS IF I DID ALSO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN. FOR ACCEPTING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THAT WE THOUGHT TO FURTHER WHITE IN THE TENT. OF ADDITIONAL LONG TERM CARE PROVIDERS -- THAT PROVIDE REALLY VALUABLE SERVICE IN THE LONG TERM CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM TODAY SO WITH THAT ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. OKAY MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS YES MISTER BURGESS. IF YOU'RE A WOMAN THIS MORE OF A KIND OF A HOUSEKEEPING PROCEDURAL QUESTION. SO THIS WOULD CREATE THIS. STUDY AND I GUESS MY QUESTION MAYBE. SB DOES TO YOU. WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THROUGH THE INSURANCE HARTMAN. TO HAVE INITIATED THE STUDY ON ITS OWN. RATHER THAN GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAD. TRY TO FIGURE OUT. IS A COMMON FOR US. TO DEL OF DIRECTLY INTO THESE APARTMENTS IN THIS FASHION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I I I I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT. FROM I THERE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN BILLS PREVIOUSLY -- PERTAIN TO JUST ANY ISSUE -- WHERE CREE HELPING AND PARTNER WITH THE MINISTRATION THIS CASE ITS OWN STAND? ALONE -- STATEWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER -- WHETHER ADMINISTRATIVE OR THROUGH A BILL. FOR THIS CASE THE COMMISSIONER SUPPORTS THIS BILL BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A PARTNERSHIP AND IT DOES PROVIDE THIS -- THIS OPEN DIALOGUE AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS I NEED TO BE A PARTNERSHIP HE BELIEVES AND SO. THE CHRISTIAN CREATING THIS THIS TASK FORCE IN THE STATUTORY CONSTRUCT OR REPAIR BILL. HELPS PROVIDE A CAN BUT FOR THE THAT THAT THAT PARTNERSHIP FROM DAY. ONE AND AS YOU KNOW. FORMER SENATOR LOTT AYE HE COMES FROM AND AND HE REALLY DOES SEE IN HIS ROLE AS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER PARTNERING WITH THE WALL AND SO HE DOES. BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A A A A A A A VERY GOOD. FOR STOP AND HAVING A BILL I AND AND BEING ABLE TO CAN PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN AND ASSEMBLYMAN AND SENATE APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AT I'VE I'VE AUTHORED A COUPLE OF THESE BILLS IN THE PAST I MEAN I JUST PASSED GOT A BILL PASSED LAST YEAR THE SORT OF WORKING. GROUP TO TO TO REALLY EXAMINE -- BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IN ITS EVERYDAY USES IN OUR EVERYDAY LIFE INCOMES ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE AND SO GENERALLY LEGISLATURE. THESE TYPES OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF THE BENEFIT OF IT BEING. COMING IS COMING FROM US IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF US AS AS WELL AND ALLOWING US TO HAVE A A ROLE IN WHAT ENDS UP. COMING GOING INTO THE COMMISSION AND WHAT COMES OUT OF THE COMMISSION AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON EVER SINCE THE NEW CLASS OF MEMBERS EXTRA TWELVE YEARS. IS YOU KNOW THERE WAS A WHAT WE BELIEVE AN APPLICATION OF A LOT OF AUTHORITY -- TO DIFFERENT -- WHETHER IT'S STATE BUREAUCRACIES ARE OTHER AREAS AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY. TO SERVE AN OVERSIGHT ROLE AND AND HAVE WHATEVER WE END UP DOING COME BACK TO US SO THAT WE CAN. WEIGH IN ON WHAT THAT PROCESS IS AND IF THEY'RE IN OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS BUY IN FROM THE BEGINNING. IT ALLOWS US AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO HAVE MORE OF ANY INTEREST IN PASSING SOMETHING LATER ON WHENEVER WE HEAR BACK FROM THE COMMISSION AND WHATEVER THIS IS ESTABLISHED AND WE GET THE REPORT BACK FROM THIS COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND LEGISLATURE HAS BY AND HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONE THAT IS ESTABLISHED AT THE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. THAT'S RIGHT TO LET IN THE MISTAKES. AT THROUGH THE TASK FORCE. AND I CAN ENVISION BRING IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TOGETHER. AND CREATING -- PLAN STATEWIDE PLANS THAT WOULD OPEN UP DOORS FOR THOSE ARE BECOMING SENIORS THOSE WITH DISABILITIES -- THOSE ARE LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME ALONG CARE A LONG TERM CARE -- SO IS ARE YOU LOOKING ALSO THE SET DOWN RATES THAN AND TERMS CONDITIONS IT IS A TASK FORCE CAN BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE MOVING FORWARD WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL. A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHAT THE SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE DIFFERENT AVENUES SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS OKAY. ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL WHAT CAN WE DO. ESTABLISH SOME TYPE OF A PROGRAM WHAT WHAT IS THAT'S PRO PROGRAM GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE COSTS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. YOU KNOW IT WILL FOR GONNA BE ESTABLISHING RATES WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE GET TALK TO THE INDUSTRY WHAT CAN THEY DO WHAT BE THE IMPLEMENTOR OF THE PROGRAM SO. I MEAN AT THE POINT OF THE TASK FORCE IS THE ANSWER ALL THAT ALL THOSE QUESTIONS AND THAT'S REASON WHY I'M RUNNING THIS BILL RIGHT NOW. RATHER THAN A BILL TO ESTABLISH -- WHAT A PROGRAM ACTUALLY WOULD LOOK LIKE JUST BECAUSE I COULDN'T ANSWER THAT AND AND AND I AND I AND I NEED MORE INFORMATION OR TO TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY INFORMATION IS POWER? MENTION THERE'S ONLY TEN OR TWELVE I GUESS THE GOAL OF THE GROW AT ONCE AGAIN. TO REACH THAT NUMBER OF EIGHTY NINETY HUNDRED THAT'LL BE PARTICIPATING WITH THE NEW. IMPLEMENTATION OF OF OF WHATEVER WE CAN PUT TOGETHER. ON THE TABLE THAT WILL SHOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN TODAY'S WORLD. YEAH I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU CENTER. BEFORE I GO TO MISS BATES WE DO HAVE A QUORUM NOW. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. RUBIO. YOUR WITH YOUR PRESENT JONES. ARCHULETA ARCHULETA PRESENT. EIGHT IT'S PRESENT BRIDGES. IS PRESENT DODD GALGIANI. GALGIANI PRESENT CLOSURE HUESO MITCHELL MORE LOCK PORTANTINO. PORTANTINO PRESENT ROTH. SORRY DOT. DOT PRESENT. NOW WE HAVE A QUORUM. ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. THANK YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR FOR SHOWING UP -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO OUT CENTER BATES YOUR NEXT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON -- FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE HERE BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW SAID NO ON THE LAST ROUND. THIS IS FOR THAT I THINK WERE OF CONCERN AND CERTAINLY LEGITIMIZING. ARE THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT THE ABILITY OF A PROGRAM THAT GIVES. AYE INITIATED THAT THAT'S TOTALLY GOVERNMENT. SO GIVE ME SOME RESPONSES AS YOU GO FORWARD. HOW YOU WOULD ARE YOU ON THE AGENDA FOR THIS TASK FORCE WOULD DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE THERE ON SOMETHING THAT'S MORE NOT JUST PUBLIC INSURANCE WITH MAYBE A PRIVATE? PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP I SEE THAT AS A SOLUTION. OF BECAUSE THE NEW PAYROLL TAX ON TOP OF PAYROLL TAXES IF OUT THAT'S THE WAY WE SUPPORT. A GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT STARTS TO BE A DIMINISHING. OF BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO SEE AB THE YOUNGER AGE YOURS THE MONEY GOING OUT. AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY -- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO NEED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE? WE HAVE IT IT IS CERTAINLY LESS THAN WHAT IT COST YOU. R. E. N. NOW -- LONG TERM CARE MY MOTHER WAS AND THAT IT WAS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH BUT BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF YOU KNOW TENSIONS THAT SHE HAD AND WHAT MY DAD PROVIDED FOR WE WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT. MIGHT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE RIGHT NOW RUNS ABOUT TWO TO IT'S NOT [inaudible] TWO THOUSAND OUR PERSON. AND THAT IS CERTAINLY LESS THAN THE COST OF LONG TERM CARE IF THAT'S GONNA KICK IN THAT IT HAS A IT'S BASICALLY LIMITED IN TERMS OF HOW LONG IT. YOU KNOW IS TO ALL THOSE THINGS THE DIMENSIONS THE COMPONENTS OF THIS TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S A VERY NOBLE CAUSE. BILL QUESTION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT THE AGENDA FOR THIS-TASK FORCE. X. THEN A WHOLE -- VETERAN OF OPPORTUNITY AND IDEAS TO ENSURE THAT A PROGRAM IS. GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND WE KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TALKED IT OUT OF THE CA BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SUSTAINABILITY THEY BELIEVE FOR A NATIONWIDE GOVERNMENT. RUN PROGRAM THAT HAS TO BE PART OF IT AND KNOWING OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND JOB I HAD A VERY -- INTERESTING CONVERSATION GOOD CONVERSATION WITH HIM TODAY OF HOW HE'S REALLY ENJOYING. MOVING AROUND THE STATE IN HEARING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND THE NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND HOW WE MEET THEM IN TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF INSURANCE THAT EVERY. ACTUALLY EVERY DIMENSION EVERY LEVEL OF OUR LIVES SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO TODAY THAT'S KIND OF A STATEMENT AND A QUESTION. I DID VOTE NO LAST TIME AND I'M NOT VOTING NO THIS TIME BUT I'M GONNA LAY OFF BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE. YOU TO SPEND SOME TIME. ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW. A CHEN DIES THEN HOW YOU RESPOND TO WHAT. OF THE OUR GOVERNOR BROWN SAID IN HI VETO MESSAGE WILL START WITHOUT ISSUE BROUGHT IT BACK. YOU DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM IN IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. SO WHAT DO YOU SEE IS THE NEW WAY TO APPROACH THIS THAT. OUR ANSWERS HIS CONCERN AND CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL. ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ME I MEAN. MY THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE FACT THAT. IT'S AN UNSUSTAINABLE SOLUTION WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE THEY NEED NAY IN A POSITION WHERE THEY NEED LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE OTHER SPENDING DOWN THEIR ASSETS IN ORDER. TO QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL AND I I JUST. THAT IS IN A SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD I ASSUME NOTHING IN THE THE CREATION OF THIS TASK FORCE I DON'T. I'M NOT POINTING IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION FOR THIS TO GO WHAT I'M TRYINGTO DO IS PUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT COLLECTION OF PEOPLE ON A TASK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO END UP WITH THE BEST PRODUCT. I DON'T HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN WHAT THAT PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THE SUGGESTIONS ARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ON IS. THE MOST UP TO DATE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD TAKING ALL OF THOSE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION TAKING COST INDIVIDUAL. CIRCUMSTANCES AND ISSUES THE PRIVATE SECTOR IMPACT PUBLIC SECTOR IMPACT I MEAN IF. IT'S GONNA BE THE ANSWER IF IT'S IT IS PRIVATE IF IT'S JOINT THEN IT IS JOINT I I I AM NOT MARRIED. AT ANY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO ANY SPECIFIC OUTCOME I JUST WANT THE BEST OUTCOME BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT MY JOB TO SAY I WANT SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY. IT'S MY JOB TO BE GET GET THE RIGHT ANSWER AND THEN. TRY TO CONVINCE YOU OF THAT THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO MOVING FORWARD. THE SENATOR IS SENATOR GALGIANI. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO ME LIKE ADOPTED PARENTS AND THEY'RE GOING TO THIS RIGHT NOW WHERE WE'RE TRYING. TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR THEM IN SIX MONTHS AND WHILE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES IS A WONDERFUL -- SERVICE TO HAVE IT DOESN'T WORK ALL THE TIME FOR ALL STAGES FOR EVERYONE AND JUSTIN IN STOCKTON FOR EXAMPLE FOR A A TWO BEDROOM INDEPENDENT LIVING PLACE IT'S THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED A MONTH. PLUS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND PERSONAND WHILE THAT INCLUDES ALL YOUR MEALS IT'S CLEARLY. OUT OF REACH FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHEN IT'S MORE OF AN INDEPENDENT LIVING SITUATION AS OPPOSED TO NEEDING ASSISTED LIVING WITH. WITH MEDIC. AND THEN AND DRESSING AND BATHING AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I REALLY THANK YOU FOR PURSUING THIS I THINK THAT -- WE NEED TO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOW FOR INDIVIDUALS WE NEED. TO THINK IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE INDEPENDENT LIVING SITUATIONS FOR SENIORS. AND WE HAVE A BABY BOOMER GENERATION WHO IS AGING OUT TO BE WELL. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PLACES. FOR THEM TO GO AND RECEIVE. THE CARE THAT THEY NEED SO THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE A PIECE OF OF WHAT THIS TASK FORCE LOOKS LIKE AND I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. THANK YOU ARE MOVED BY MISTRUST LETTER BUT BEFORE WE DO I WANT TO JUST -- MAKE COMMENTS ON IT I THINK YOU KNOW AS TO MISTER MARTINEZ MENTION IT'S A GREAT FOR STAFF. AND I REALLY DO -- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE TAKING SUGGESTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME JUST INITIALLY. NOT I'M A BIG CONCERN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BOARD MAKE UP THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE STATE. YOUR FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS I AM AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS I HEAR A LOT IS THAT SOMETIMES WE TEND. TO FILL THOSE SLOTS WITH EITHER NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN AND THEN WE HAVE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT GETS LEFT OUT STILL. IN PEOPLE FROM EVERY SECTOR EVERY SINGLE OUT GEOGRAPHIC. AREA FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN WHEREVER IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERYONE DEALS WITH DIFFERENT ISSUES DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY'RE AT AND SO JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER THAT MOVIE FOR MAKING SURE WE AT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA TO BE REPRESENTED I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AND IN A MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR AND AND YOUR STAFF TO FIND THE PROPER LANGUAGE TO STRESS THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU END UP MISTER TO THEM WITH THE BILL THESE [inaudible] I'M SORRY. MR -- CALDERON WHICH YOU WISH TO CLOSE I I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE.

CAPACITY IN THE RIGHT KIND OF MEMBERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES TO DO SO -- AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO START WORKING ON IT. TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP TO START WORKING ON AN ISSUE THAT IS ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND GET WORSE -- AND SO THE TIME IS NOW TO ACT.
