00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:20.356
QUESTION IS WAS THERE. THIS

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:22.525
THIS PROBLEM EXIST PRIOR THAT

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.535
THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:36.172
BACKLOG- A STANDARD. THAT IS

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:36.773
ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:39.409
OF LABOR. I THINK THE BACKLOG

00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:41.511
ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:44.147

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.515
CONSIDERED TO BE BEYOND THAT IS

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:48.584
NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN THE PAST.

00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:51.821
EDG HAD A PERCENTAGE OF 8%

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:55.725

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.808
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.744

OF. THE TUNNEL PROBABLY AT THE

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:52.601
END OF JUNE. R. BUT I WANT TO

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.303
REITERATE A LARGE PART OF THE

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.705
SEARCH HAS COME FROM PEOPLE WHO

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:59.675
HAVE HIT THEIR BENEFIT YEAR AND.

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:00.209
AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:03.345
EXAMPLE SO YOU KNOW OF. NOBODY

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:04.780
CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED ME

ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WERE

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:08.851
THEY GONNA DO THEY GOT THEY GOT

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.052
THEIR LAST CHECK THEY WERE

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:12.921
WAITING FOR A CHECK. THE CHECK

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:13.889

DON'T NECESSARILY PAY ATTENTION

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:27.069
TO EVERYTHING. SO I COMPLETELY

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.604
UNDERSTOOD WHY THE GENTLEMAN

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.206
WAS ASKED ME GOOD SO I SAID IF

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:34.409

CHECKED YOUR EMAIL BUT IT

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:37.980
REALLY SHOULD BE ON YOUR CHECK.

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.915
LATER I SILENCE YES IT WAS ON

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:41.950

PEOPLE ARE NOT- SAVVY ABOUT.

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.330
HOW TO DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT AND

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:56.298
HAVE A LOOK AT HOW TO WORK WITH

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:59.434
FORMS ARE OR THEY THEY JUST

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.503
I'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO WHO WROTE

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:05.641
IT SAID. BOB I GOT A MESSAGE

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:08.076
FROM EDT THAT SAYS I DON'T HAVE

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.211
TO DO ANYTHING AND I WILL BE

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:12.281
PAID AND MY BACK PAYMENT WILL

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:15.484
BE MADE TO ME. IN WICKS. WHAT

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:21.657
DOES THIS MEAN. EIGHT WHAT ARE

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.158
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:26.461
RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:14:26.528 --> 01:14:28.163
IT'S HARD TO GET IN WITH PEOPLE

SOMETIMES ARE OUT FOR THEIR

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:31.834
BEST FOR THEIR OWN BEST

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.102
INEREST I THINK THAT THE SURGE

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:36.405
IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:37.139
DIFFICULTIES OF PEOPLE

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.675

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.279
WHY DO I HAVE TO CERTIFY EVERY

LOOKED AT AREAS WHERE WE CAN

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:00.229
AUTOMATE. OUR SOME OF OUR

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.697
MANUAL PROCESSES AND WE'VE DONE

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:04.166

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.970

SERVING OUR DISTRICT AND THE

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.366
REALITY IS THAT WITH OUR

01:52:20.433 --> 01:52:21.634
DISTRICT STAFF MOST OF THE

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:24.337
TIME. DEALING WITH EDT CASES

01:52:24.404 --> 01:52:25.705
THAT'S NOT IN THEIR JOB PER

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:28.074
VIEW FOR THE PAST YEAR A LOT OF

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:29.442
OTHER THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:31.978
BE FOCUSED ON- ISN'T GETTING

SMALL BUSINESSES WE'VE DONE A

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:38.284
LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE THAT A

01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:40.453
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO BE

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.589
ABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR RENT A

01:52:42.655 --> 01:52:45.692
LOT OF- A GOLDEN STIMULUS.

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:47.427
AGENDA ITEMS THAT WE HAVE MOVED

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:48.595
FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.330
COMMUNITIES ARE THRIVING BUT

01:52:50.396 --> 01:52:51.264
THAT ALSO MEANS THAT OUR

01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:53.700
DISTRICT STAFF IN OUR DISTRICT

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:56.169
TEAMS. ARMS HAVING THE

01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:57.670
OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REACH

01:52:57.737 --> 01:52:59.172
OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AS THEY

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:00.440
NORMALLY WOULD BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:02.509
WORKING ON VERY IMPORTANT EDT

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:03.977
CASES. WHICH IS NOT

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:06.312
TRADITIONALLY THEIR JOB SO WE

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:07.614
STILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:08.815
OUR OFFICE THAT WE NEED TO

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:11.184
ENSURE GET TAKEN CARE OF. AND

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:13.153
THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT

01:53:13.219 --> 01:53:14.687
GETTING THE PRIORITY THAT IT

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.656
DESERVES. BECAUSE OUR STAFFS

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:19.792
ARE WORKING ON EDT CASES. SO I

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:20.760
WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:22.829

MEMBERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:28.535
BECAUSE THE LIAISONS ARE NOT

01:53:28.601 --> 01:53:30.103
ENOUGH. IT'S A PART TIME

01:53:30.170 --> 01:53:32.605
POSITION AND THE REALITY IS

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:33.640
THAT IT'S OUR DISTRICT STAFF

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:34.841
THAT CONTINUES TO DO THE WORK

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:35.942
OF EDT AND THAT'S NOT

01:53:36.009 --> 01:53:37.043
ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE AT THIS

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:38.978
POINT. SO WE REALLY NEED TO

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.446
FIGURE THIS OUT IN A REAL WAY.

01:53:40.513 --> 01:53:42.515

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.810
NUMBERS AS WE GET TO THAT PAGE

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:01.012
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:02.781
ON GETTING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:04.649

THE YEARS DUE TO ALL OF THE NEW

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:16.795
LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:19.164
SUPPORTIVE ON MAKING SURE THAT

02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:23.969
THE COUNTIES ARE FUNDED. FOR

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:24.569
THE ELECTION THAT MAY NEED TO

BE CALLED. THANK YOU- IS THERE

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:29.941
SOMEONE FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE.

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:33.478
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:34.846
WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S

02:17:34.913 --> 02:17:37.382
BEEN SAID SO FAR IN TERMS OF

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:38.750
THE FACT THAT ELECTION BECAUSE

02:17:38.817 --> 02:17:40.151
SEVEN INCREASING OVER TIME IT'S

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:41.953
LARGELY DUE BECAUSE HOW PEOPLE

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.089

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:46.725
TIME AS WELL AS THE- MANDATES

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:48.927
THAT BEEN ESTABLISHED THE ONE

02:17:48.994 --> 02:17:51.696
THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:53.765
THE ASSOCIATION'S ESTIMATES

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:55.834
WERE BASED ON THAT NOVEMBER

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.836
TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AND SO.

02:17:57.902 --> 02:18:00.672
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT

02:18:00.739 --> 02:18:02.207
TO WHICH A RECALL ELECTION

02:18:02.273 --> 02:18:04.009
WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION

02:18:04.075 --> 02:18:05.277
ADDS THAT NOVEMBER RECALL

02:18:05.343 --> 02:18:07.245
NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION WILL

02:18:07.312 --> 02:18:08.513
DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S COSTS

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:09.781
ACTUALLY REFLECTED THE NOVEMBER

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:11.516
ELECTION SO I REALLY JUST DON'T

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.351
KNOW WHAT A RECALL ELECTION

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:15.286
MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT DEPENDS ON

02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:16.988
THE LENGTH OF THE BALLOT. IT

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.223
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF PUBLIC

02:18:18.289 --> 02:18:19.924
HEALTH ORDERS ARE IN EFFECT AT

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:21.893
THE TIME OR THAT THE REGISTERS

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.195
PREPARE FOR- IN ADVANCE FOR

02:18:24.262 --> 02:18:27.098

VOTING OR FOR EARLY VOTING- AND

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:33.571
THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD

02:18:33.638 --> 02:18:35.707
LIKE TO ADD IS. THAT AS THE

02:18:35.774 --> 02:18:37.509
LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD AND

02:18:37.575 --> 02:18:41.646
CONSIDERING WHAT IF ANY- STATE

02:18:41.713 --> 02:18:44.949
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED- TO ASSIST

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:47.452
COUNTIES. IN ANY RECALL

02:18:47.519 --> 02:18:50.622
ELECTION WOULD BE TO EXPLORE TO

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:52.390
WHAT EXTENT OF THE STATE'S

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:54.659
FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:57.662
PAY FOR THE COVETED RELATED

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:59.764
EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH THE A.

02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:08.239
R. P. AND THE STATE HAS A

02:19:08.306 --> 02:19:09.741
FAIRLY WIDE DISCRETION HOW TO

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:11.876
USE THAT MONEY THAT BEING SAID.

02:19:11.943 --> 02:19:14.112

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.749
SPECIFICS OF HOW THE FUNDS CAN

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:20.518
BE USED- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE

02:19:20.585 --> 02:19:22.320
FUNDS COULD BE USED TO OFFSET

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:24.222
AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE COSTS

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:26.257

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:27.392

TIME FRAME TO PRINT AND MAIL.

02:21:37.288 --> 02:21:39.057
TRANSFORMATION GUIDE WE ARE

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:40.725
UNAWARE THAT THE STATE OF

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:42.694
REIMBURSED THE COUNTY FOR THE

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.095
CONDUCT OF THE TWO THOUSAND

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:45.363
THREE OR ELECTION.

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:47.365
UNFORTUNATELY BY SEVERAL OF US

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:50.501
FOLKS HERE WERE NOT CONDUCTING

02:21:50.568 --> 02:21:58.843
ELECTIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND

02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.444
THREE SO WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE

02:21:59.510 --> 02:22:00.011
RECORDS INTO. WHERE WHAT THE

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:01.679
RECORD BECAUSE- WHERE OR THEY

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:04.315
ARE I KNOW. A MAN I DO KNOW

02:22:04.382 --> 02:22:05.183
THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.719
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO.

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:09.687
DETERMINE THE COST THAT WERE IN

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:10.855
TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND WE

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:12.457
WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:14.158
THAT QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO

02:22:14.225 --> 02:22:16.027
SAY I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:16.961
ADDRESSED THIS AND I DON'T WANT

02:22:17.028 --> 02:22:19.530
TO. BELABOR THE FACT BUT WE DO

02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:22.634
UNDERSTAND THAT LEAD CURRENT OF

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.902
POTENTIAL RECALL WOULD BE

02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:26.037
CONDUCTED AT OF WITH EVERY

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:28.339
REGARDING A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:29.240
WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

02:22:29.307 --> 02:22:32.043
INCREASE ANY ELECTION CALL AND

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:33.912
ALSO THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:35.947
MODEL OF OPENING EARLY VOTING

02:22:36.014 --> 02:22:36.948
SITES AT THE L. A. YOU KNOW THE

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:38.516
CAPTAIN AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS

02:22:38.583 --> 02:22:40.551
HAVE SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE.

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:42.353
SO I DO BELIEVE WE WOULD BE

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.188
COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:46.491
EXACTLY THAT AT ELECTION WAS

02:22:46.557 --> 02:22:48.059
CONDUCTED MANY MANY YEARS AGO

02:22:48.126 --> 02:22:49.894
AND I THOUGHT I WA WITH

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:51.863
EIGHTEEN AKSAKOV HAVE GONE.

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:53.898
SIGNIFICANTLY AT OVER THE LAST

02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:56.768
SEVERAL YEARS I THINK THE ONE

02:22:56.834 --> 02:22:58.102
HOUR LECTURE THAT WE COULD LOOK

02:22:58.169 --> 02:22:59.404
TO ALTHOUGH IT WOULD DEFINITELY

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:01.372
NOT BE A COMPARISON WOULD BE

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:03.541
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NEWMAN

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:06.210
RECALL ACTION THIS ELECTION WAS

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:08.146
CONDUCTED ON THESE CURRENT- WE

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:10.248
CONTACT YOU. HOWEVER THIS

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:11.749
ELECTION WAS ONLY CONDUCTED AND

02:23:11.816 --> 02:23:13.685
WITH THREE COUNTY LOS ANGELES

02:23:13.751 --> 02:23:16.888
ORANGE AND SAMPOERNA DINO- IF

02:23:16.955 --> 02:23:17.956
THEIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

02:23:18.022 --> 02:23:19.357
WORKED WITH THESE THREE

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:20.925
COUNTIES TO ESTIMATE THAT A

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:22.427
STANDALONE ELECTION WOULD COST

02:23:22.493 --> 02:23:24.228
ABOUT TWO POINT SIX MILLION

02:23:24.295 --> 02:23:25.897
VOTERS IN MARCH TWO POINT SIX

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:27.532
MILLION DOLLARS- I NEED TO LOOK

02:23:27.598 --> 02:23:28.599
AT HOW MANY VOTERS THAT

02:23:28.666 --> 02:23:31.035
ENTAILED BUT- JUST BELOW THAT

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:32.603
OF THE- SENATE- COMMITTEE IS

02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:34.372
AWARE. THAT THIS ELECTION WAS

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:37.375
CONSOLIDATED WITH THE JUNE

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:37.875
TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIMARY

02:23:37.942 --> 02:23:39.310
ELECTION SO THE ESTIMATED COST

02:23:39.377 --> 02:23:49.821
WOULD CLOSER. TO NINE HUNDRED

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:50.455
THOUSAND. THANK YOU FOR THAT I

02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:51.589
AM- THE INFORMATION THAT IT'S

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:52.924
NOT THE SAME. I'D SAY LIKE TO

02:23:52.991 --> 02:23:54.926
KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST WHAT IS

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:56.928
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO

02:23:56.995 --> 02:23:58.162
THOUSAND THREE RECALL OF A

02:23:58.229 --> 02:23:59.530
GOVERNOR AND THIS POTENTIAL

WHEN THEY ACCESS STATE SYSTEMS

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:39.229
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THOSE SYSTEMS

ARE BUILT AND MAINTAINED IN

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:43.067
DEPARTMENTS INDEPENDENTLY. THAT

02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:44.168
LEVEL OF EITHER USER

BY DEPARTMENT WHICH LEADS TO

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:51.709
VERY DIFFERENT USER EXPERIENCE

02:35:51.775 --> 02:35:52.810

02:36:13.731 --> 02:36:15.032
ACTUALLY LESS SECURE AND LESS

02:36:15.099 --> 02:36:16.867

LOOK TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:29.847
