RIGHT SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING SO IT WORKS THERE WAS A PROVISION THAT SAID THAT -- THE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN SHALL SET A BILL FOR HEARING AND THAT'S BEEN CHANGED TO MAY -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A FUNDAMENTALLY FISSILE PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT WITH BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HEAR ANY BILL THAT HAS BEEN AUTHORED BY A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING CUSTOMER PRACTICE.

YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO SO. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE FORTY NINE ASSEMBLY BILL NINE FORTY NINE WILL PROHIBIT THE INSTALLATION OF UNSAFE TIRES. ON CARS WHILE MAINTAINING THE ABILITY OF RETAILERS TO SELL THEM FOR OTHER USES. CONSUMERS PRIDGEN SEEING USED TIRES FOR USE ON THE ROAD. ARE OFTEN NOT AWARE OF THE TRUE CONDITION. ESPECIALLY THERE'S NO VISIBLE DAMAGE. LYSONS AUTOMATED REPAIR DEALERS ARE MORE EDUCATED THAN CONSUMERS AND ARE IN A BETTER POSITION. TO JUDGE THE SAFETY. OF THE USED TIRES FOR INSTALLATION. AB NINE FORTY NINE IS IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL. IN FACT IT IS SIMILAR TO VERSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED IN COLORADO OHIO AND NEW JERSEY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY IS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL JEFF CYBER IS REPRESENTING THE UNITED STATES TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OFFERS WHEN HIS PLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE JEFF SIEVERS ON BEHALF OF US TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION THIS IS THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE TWELVE U. S. -- TIRE MANUFACTURERS IN THE COUNTRY. THEY MAKE ROUGHLY 80% OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION TIRES OUT -- THIS IS SIMPLE BILL BASS HE TRYING TO SAY THAT -- AN AUTO REPAIR TECHNICIAN DEALER CAN'T INSTALL AN UNSAFE USED TIRE AND THEN DEFINES WHAT AN UNSAFE USED TIRES. THIS ACTUALLY STATURE IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED IN SEVERAL DECADES IN FACT WE'RE STILL USING THE OLD ONE THIRTY SECOND STANDARD -- LÃ  EVERYBODY ELSE THE COUNTRY'S GONE ON FOR THE ONES. I'M. SO YOU KNOW SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY -- YET SOME CONSUMERS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO REPLACING -- UNDER TIRES SEEK MORE AFFORDABLE REMEDIES AND SOMETIMES THE GOVERNOR TO VALUES TIRES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY DO THAT THE TIRE THEY'RE BUYING A SAFE -- NHTSA HAS IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW THAT UNSAFE USED TIRES ARE ONE OF THE MOST -- PROBLEMATIC ISSUES ON IN WHEN THERE ARE HAPPEN TO BE ACCIDENTS SO WE WANT TO AVOID THAT AT ALL COSTS. AND YOU KNOW USED TIRES THAT CLEARLY UNSAFE CONDITIONS SHOULDN'T BE ONS INSTALLING CARS HOWEVER WHEN CONSUMERS GO THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THAT INFORMATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO IT -- TIRE DEALER SHOP THEY'RE BUYING SOME USED TIRES OF THE ONES ARE GETTING ARE SAFE AND SHOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE ROAD. THAT OTHER CRITICAL COMPONENT IS ONLY PART OF THE CAR THAT ACTUALLY TOUCHES THE ROAD -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE DRIVING ON THEY ARE SAFE SELF -- PROHIBITING THE INSULATION UNSAFE USED TIRES MAKES COMMON SENSE AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE HOUSE THE FORT. PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF. GREG HUNTER ON BEHALF OF TRIPLE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON JACK PAULA DONOVAN BEHALF OF THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCILS CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COALITION AND THE CALIFORNIA TIRE DEALERS ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS A CONCEPT WERE WORKING WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR ON SOME CLARA FIND IN TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. UNLIKE FLANIGAN LE AYE LES SCHWAB TIRE CENTERS -- THAT -- BUT JACK MALL DONNA JUST SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MUCH. SEEING NO OTHER SUPPORTERS OF OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON UP. I DON'T SEE ANY LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COME IS MISTER WHEN GO AHEAD -- THANK YOU FOR CARING THIS BILL AND I AM GOING TO BE OF SUPPORTING BUT I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IN SUBSECTION BE IT NOTES THAT UNSAFE TIRES. THAT ARE REMOVED AND REINSTALLED ARE NOT -- INCLUDED AND I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANT. TO FORCE ANYBODY TO PURCHASE NEW TIRES BUT IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE THE OWNER OF THE CARS WARRANT THAT THE TIRES ARE UNSAFE. SO -- ORIGINALLY THAT SECTION WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED FOR YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ROADSIDE SERVICE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE THAT NEEDED SO -- THAT WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY THE ROLE BUT WHEN THEY DO GO AND THERE IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER A ARBY'S -- CHECK A PLATE PROGRAM SO IF YOU BRING IT IN BY LAW THE ENTIRE TWO YEARS ARE REQUIRED TO INFLATE CHECK THE TIRE INFLATED. IF IT'S UNSAFE THEY ARE REQUIRED O NOT INFLATED AND TELL THE CONSUMER WHY. SO THAT IS THAT IS ALREADY IN EXISTING LAW RIGHT JUST WANTED TO CHECK OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH MISTER OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MR MEDIA THANKS FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. HI TECH ALSO QUESTION ABOUT SUBSECTION BE OF THE BILL THEN I'LL READ IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THAT I'M ASKING ABOUT ITSAYS. THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO A TIRE MOUNTED ON A WHEEL OR RIM THAT IS TEMPORARY WORK TEMPORARILY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND REINSTALLED IN THE SAME VEHICLE. SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING -- TO EXEMPT PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAD THE TIRE ON A ROOM WE'RE TAKING THE ROOM OFF FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T WORK ON THE THE BREAK OR SOMETHING AND PUTTING IT BACK ON SO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT MY POINT IS THAT. IT'S AMBIGUOUS WHETHER OR NOT. THAT EXEMPTION APPLIES. TO THE TIRE FOR THE RAM SO IT SAYS. DOES NOT APPLY TO A TIRE A RAM TEMPORARILY REMOVED THE VEHICLE SO YOU COULD INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN IF YOU TEMPORARILY REMOVED THE RAM. CHANGE THE TIRE BUT PUT THE SAME RAN BACK ON THE VEHICLE THAT THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT WHICH I'M SURE IS NOT YOUR INTENTION SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS A BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK THAT LANGUAGE NEEDS TO BE TIED UP. THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT BY THE TIRE DEALERS AND THAT'S WHEN THE TECHNICAL CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS FOR WORKING. I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EDITION OF COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS A MEASURE THIS IS A VERY GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE. AND I THINK IT MAKES SENSE ALSO TO SHIFT PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM A LAY PERSON TO SOMEBODY WITH THE EXPERTISE AND YOU KNOW WHO WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY. A ONE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWENTY TWO AND A THIRTY SECOND OR SECOND THIRTY SECONDS. HI I'M REAL CONFUSED HEY. WE ARE JUST THE LATELY PEOPLE SO IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT SO -- HOT SO MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO SUPPORT AND THE BILL WILL GO -- TO APPROPRIATIONS NECK SO WITH THAT DOES HE KNOW THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS FEDERATION OR SOME SAM. MOTION IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO PLEASE PROCEED. TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; HI SO I FONG BY FONG AYE&lt;/c&gt; BAUER QUE HAN [inaudible] BERMAN. WEBER. WEBER AYE MULLIN [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN [inaudible] I'M SORRY. IRWIN I OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH. SMITH I WEEKS WHICH ARE THE BILL SO THAT BILL IS OUT ON A TWO ZERO VOTE THAT WILL LEAVE THE ROAD OPEN FOR AT ADD ONS LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE HE HAS A. B. ELEVEN THIRTY WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE MISTER LEVINE. AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB ELEVEN THIRTY SPONSORED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR TO SERRA WOULD REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS. WHENEVER THEIR GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OR BIOMETRIC INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED IN A DATA BREACH. IT ALSO REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THESE TWO CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM BREACH OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO CALIFORNIA BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST STATES. TO ENACT A LAW THAT REQUIRES BUSINESSES BUSINESSES TO NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHEN EVER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED IN A DATA BREACH. CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SAME TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH CURRENTLY INCLUDES A PERSON'S SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE OR ID CARD. CREDIT CARD NUMBER MEDICAL INFORMATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE INFORMATION WHEN COMBINED WITH THE PERSON'S NAME IS THE EXISTING LAW DOES NOT HOWEVER APPLY THESE REQUIREMENTS TO OTHER GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID NUMBERS LIKE A PASSPORT NUMBER. OR TO A PERSON'S BIOMETRIC INFORMATION IN THE CASE OF PASSPORT NUMBERS. THIS LOOPHOLE WAS STARKLY EXPOSED BY THE MASSIVE MATH -- MARRIOTT DATA BREACH LAST YEAR OF THE CUSTOMER'S RECORDS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. I WOULD NOTE THAT THIRTEEN STATES ALREADY HAVE LAWS THAT APPLY TO PASSPORTS IN GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID NUMBERS THERE ARE TWELVE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LAWS PERTAINING. TO BIOMETRIC INFORMATION DISCLOSURE IN SHORT AB ELEVEN THIRTY AN AXE COMMONSENSE CHANGES THAT WILL HELP CLOSE A SIGNIFICANT GAP. IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND ENSURE THAT OUR STATE REMAINS A LEADER IN PROTECTING THE PERSONAL DATA OF CONSUMERS. REQUIRING NOTIFICATION TO CONSUMERS IN CASES OF DATA BREACH AND AND AND YOU KNOW. AT LAST NOTE I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAMBER THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH BOTH MY OFFICE AND WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF. ON NEGOTIATING -- LANGUAGE FOR THIS BILL AND WE ARE VERY HOPE THAT WILL GET INTO A REALLY GOOD LANDING -- SPOT. WITH THIS AT THAT AT THIS POINT LET ME INTRODUCE STACEY STRUCTURE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SLASH AXING I'M GONNA YOUR SIGN. BRIEFLY THING I'M ANTHONY LEE WEALTH WITH DO JANE AND INTO ANY GENERAL'S GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL TO IMPROVE OUR STATES DATABASE NOTIFICATION LARA. AND BETTER PROTECT THE PERSONAL DATA OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS -- AND AGAIN WE ON OUR SIDE OR ENGAGE WITH THE CHAMBER AND DISCUSSIONS ON AMENDMENTS. TO DEFINITIONS AND SO FORTH AND WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING PROGRESS -- WORKING WITH THEM AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. AND THE IMPETUS OF THIS BILL REALLY CAME FROM. WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SIMILAR POSITION ONE OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THERE MIGHT BE A MERRY AT SIZE BREACH OF BIOMETRIC INFORMATION OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE. AND CALIFORNIA HAD NO LAW ON THE BOOKS TO REQUIRE IT TO BE REASONABLY PROTECTED. BY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE CHOSEN TO COLLECTED SO WE WANT TO STAY. YOU KNOW ON A CURVE AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN THIS AREA AND I'M GONNA NOW THAT STACY. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BUT THE THING. THANK YOU AGAIN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID NUMBERS SUCH AS YOUR PASSPORT NUMBER AND YOUR BIOMETRIC INFORMATION ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE AND HISTORICALLY. HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE LAW AND AND BOTH OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IN THE DATA BREACH ON VACATION LÃ  AND THE REASONABLE DATA SECURITY LAW. THIS IS DATA THAT IS USED AS AN IDENTIFIER BUT ALSO AS A FORM OF IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I GO TO A CREDITOR AND THEY SAY. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT SPECIES AFTER I GIVE THEM MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER? IN SOMECASES I VERIFY MY IDENTITY BY TELLING THEM WHAT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER IS OR MY PASSPORT INFORMATION. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS WHAT SOMEONE CAN ALSO USED TO STEAL MY IDENTITY AND COMMIT FRAUD AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT COMPANIES NUMBER ONE PROTECT AT AND NUMBER TWO TELL ME IF THEY'VE BEEN BREACH SO I CAN TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT MYSELF. WE KNOW THAT THIS TYPE OF IDENTITY VERIFICATION OR RELYING ON IDENTIFYING NUMBERS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SECRET. BUT SOMETIMES ARE ACTUALLY KNOWN TO MANY IS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE BUT THIS IS THE METHOD THAT STILL USE AND SO WHY SECURITY AND IDENTITY VERIFICATION ARE IMPROVING FROM THINGS THAT WE HAVE. LIKE PHYSICAL OBJECTS SUCH AS CREDIT CARDS OR THINGS THAT WE KNOW SUCH AS PASSPORTS AND NUMBERS. THERE ARE ALSO A BALDING TWO THINGS THAT WE ARE SUCH AS OUR BIOMETRIC DATA. THIS IS WHY RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO WORK TO PROTECT ALL OF IT. AMENDING THE STATUTE IS CRITICAL BOTH BECAUSE OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE THE BEEN POINTED OUT REGARDING THE STAR WOULD PREACH AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WHERE. TECHNOLOGY IS GOING. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS THAT BOTH STATUES REMAINS CONSISTENT PLACE THE AND IT PLACES. AN OBLIGATION ON BUSINESSES TO PROACTIVELY PROTECT THESE DATA POINTS WITH REASONABLE SECURITY AS WELL AS IF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE DATA IS BREACHED NOTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS SO PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIKE. MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON AT THE CORBIN ON BEHALF OF A STILL YOU EFF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE -- CONCEPTUALLY OF I AND COMMONSENSE MEET EXCUSE ME WERE SUPPORTIVE CONCEPTUALLY THE BILL -- IN FACT PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE ACTUALLY DID A NATIONAL STUDY JUST LAST YEAR CALIFORNIANS BY TO BEING THE FIRST NATION TO PASS DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS HAS IN FACT FALLING BEHIND IN A NUMBER OF AREAS THIS IS ONE OF THEM -- AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING FORWARD ON THIS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AND HAVE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRICS -- AND THE THE NATURE OF OUR CONCERNS HINGES IN PARTICULAR ON THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRICS IN THE C. C. P. A. ITSELF PASSED LAST YEAR -- AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE THE BILL AMENDED ADD TO BE ALIGNED WITH THAT STATUTE BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. HI THIS IS MORE IN MONEY WITH CONSUMER PRICE AND I WOULD JUST SECOND THE STATEMENTS MADE BY SAMANTHA JUST NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE SEEING NONE LET'S INVITE THE OPPOSITION TO THE TABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SERRA BOOT AND I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- WONDERING REITERATE WHAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH MISTER LEVINE AND HIS STAFF AND WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER FIRSTLY WE JUST RAN OUT OF TIME BEFORE THIS HEARING I AM VERY HOPEFUL WE'RE GONNA. BE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THESE AMENDMENTS AND COME TO A POSITION AND REMOVE OUR OPPOSE LAST MINUTE POSITION -- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR SCHOOL YOU TURN THE GENERAL SCHOOL TO ENSURE. NOTIFICATION OF DATA BREACHES OF PASSPORTS AND BIOMETRIC DATA IF IT'S MORE PRECISELY DEFINED -- BUT RIGHT NOW OUR CONCERN IS THE LANGUAGE OF AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS OVER BROAD IN IT THIS BILL CERTAINLY GOES BEYOND REACH NOTIFICATION -- IT CREATES ADDITIONAL LIABILITY TO BUSINESSES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACTS ONEROUS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH MEANS THE ANY BREACH OR DISCLOSURE OF THE STATE WILL LEAD TO A LAWSUIT WERE IN PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANY INJURY. AND SIGNIFICANT MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES CAN BE AWARDED -- WE DON'T OBJECT TO THE NOTION THAT THIS TYPE OF DATA SHOULD HAVE REASONABLE SECURITY BUT WE OBJECT TO THIS SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PLACED. ON FOR EXAMPLE BIOMETRIC DATA UNDER THE C. P. AND AND WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS IF WE DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISCOURAGE THE USE OF BIOMETRIC DATA AS AN AUTHENTICATOR IT IS A SAFER WAY TO AUTHENTICATE IDENTITY THAN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. UNLIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BIOMETRIC DATA IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IDENTIFIER THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF BIOMETRIC DATA NOT ONE AND SO THEREFORE THE BREACH OF ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF THAT DATA DOES NOT CREATE. THE SIGNIFICANT RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD BUT ADDING IT TO THE LIST OF ITEMS FOR WHICH A COMPANY CAN BE SUED WITH NO PROOF OF INJURY -- WOULD STRONGLY DISCOURAGE THAT EFFECTIVE PRO PRIVACY SECURITY MEASURE. MORE IMPORTANTLY THE LANGUAGE DEFINING -- BIOMETRIC DATA UNDER AB ELEVEN THIRTY IS OVERLY BROAD. REFERENCE TO ANY UNIQUE PHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OR DIGITAL REPRESENTATION OF BIOMETRIC DATA COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE PHOTOS OUR BEHAVIORAL DATA IT COULD INCLUDE SHOE SIZE OR CLOTHING SIZE. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF STATE DID REACH NOTIFICATION LAWS RECOGNIZE THAT BIO METRIC DATA USED TO AUTHENTICATE AN INDIVIDUAL IS THE TYPE OF BIOMETRIC DATA THAT CREATES THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD WHICH IS WHAT THE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LÃ  WAS DESIGNED TO COMBAT. WITHOUT THIS LIMITING ELEMENT TO THAT DEFINITION IT WOULD INCLUDE OTHER TYPES OF MEASUREMENTS AGAIN LIKE THAT A CLOTHING STORE AN OPTOMETRIST MIGHT HAVE THAT WOULD NOT POSE A RISK OF HARM -- AND FINALLY -- RIGHT NOW AB ELEVEN THIRTY WOULD ADD ALL GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS TO THIS LIST -- AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT'S OVERLY BROAD IT'S GONNA I MEAN THAT WOULD BE ANY GOVERNMENT ISSUED I'D ANY GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION CASE NUMBER FROM ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. EVEN IF IT DOESN'T POSE A RISK OF HARM LIKE A FISHING LICENSE OR PROFESSIONAL LICENSE NUMBER WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE NARROWED AS WELL -- BUT AGAIN. VERY HELPFUL BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE NEEDED OFFICE AND AND AND GET TO A PLACE GREEMENT ON THIS VERY HELPFUL FOR THAT AND WE THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU MATCHING NEXT WITNESS PLEASE SHARE MEMBERS BUT HAVING COME AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM WE NEED TO RESPECT OUR POSE UNLESS AMENDED. PART OF THE CAL CHAMBER COALITION WE HAVE SOME PARTICULAR CONCERNS BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE IN ILLINOIS. WE'VE SEEN A FLOOD OF LITIGATION UNDER THE ILLINOIS STATUTE RELATED TO THE USE OF BIOMETRIC TIME CLOCKS -- INCLUDING ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SHARING OF DATA FROM THOSE TIME CLOCKS TO PAYROLL PROCESSORS CONSTITUTES A BREACH. AND SO WE TALK TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE. THE COMMITTEE STAFF WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS OF TO SEE IF WE CAN CLARIFY THAT ISSUE GOING FORWARD -- IN ILLINOIS SINCE MID TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE'VE SEEN A HUNDRED FIFTY CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED UNDER THE ILLINOIS STATUTE. ABOUT 90% OF THEM HAVE ARISEN OUT OF THE USE OF BIOMETRIC TIME CLOCKS SO WE'D LIKE TO GET AHEAD OF THIS ISSUE AND SEE IF WE CAN CLARIFY ISSUES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANNA ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION PLEASE STEP FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON KEVIN KELLY I'M HAVE INTERNET ASSOCIATION -- ECHO THE CHECK THE CHAMBERS COMMENTS -- AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED A SPONSOR ON HONING IN THE DEFINITIONS A LITTLE BIT -- SPECIALLY TO REFLECT THE FOCUS ON DATA THAT CAN BE USED AUTHENTICATE THAT THE DOJ WERE. TALKED ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. HI KELLY HAD ON BEHALF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CAL CHAMBER AND REPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACCORDING JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECH MATT ECHO THE COMMENTS THE CHAMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU. EXPLAINS MARGARET GLAD OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AT ECHO THE COMMENTS OF JAMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING ALL THE COMMENTS ARE. QUESTIONS LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER GALLAGHER GO AHEAD. YES - THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THE BILL IT IN OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CREATE THOSE PROTECTIONS -- FOR THE SENSITIVE DATA -- THE ISSUE OF THE BIOMETRIC DATA I MEAN I GUESS MAYBE THE MOST PREVALENT ONE WOULD BE A FINGERPRINT. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S COLLECTED -- WHAT EIGHT ONE WHAT IN YOUR AS YOU UNDERSTAND THIS BILL WHAT ELSE THIS BIOMETRIC DATA INCLUDE WHAT OTHER KITE TYPES OF THINGS? THOROUGH BIOMETRIC DATA. I HAVE TO LIST. THEM FOR EXAMPLE THE THE DEFINITION OF IT -- IT CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE FINGERPRINT YOUR DNA FACE RECOGNITION PALM PRINTS. IRIS RECOGNITION YOUR HAND GEOMETRY -- YOUR IN SOME CASES D. ANALYSIS -- YOUR VOICE THESE ARE ALL. THINGS THAT ARE HUMAN BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN BE USED AS A DATA POINT TO IDENTIFY AUTHENTICATE AND VERIFY THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE. AND SO THESE ARE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ARE REQUIRE SOME LEVEL OF PROCESSING SOME TECHNICAL PROCESSING WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE DEFINITION -- AND THAT IS WHAT WHAT IS SEEK TO ENCOMPASS IN IN IN TERMS OF ADDING THIS NEW POINT. RED BUT IN A VACUUM SOME OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT NOT IDENTIFY YOU LIKE. YOU KNOW SOMEONE MIGHT GET A COPY OF MY FINGERPRINT RIGHT BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S MINE RIGHT ABSENT SOMETHING THAT CONNECTS IT. RIGHT THAT RIGHT SO IS IS THE BREACH IF YOU WILL UNDER THIS LEGISLATION [inaudible] JUST. THAT THING IN ITSELF FOR ONLY IF IT SOMEHOW. CAN BE TRACED BACK TO SOMEBODY I'M SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND A QUESTION THE STATUTE DOES SPEAK TO THAT SO IN TERMS OF HOW THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS UNDER THE THE FRAMEWORK. IT'S YOUR NAME PLUS THE UNIQUE BIOMETRIC DATA OKAY. BUT THERE THE MAN MAYBE TO MISS BIT THIS. YOUR YOUR ISSUE IS THAT WERE. THIS IS PRETTY BROAD IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED BIOMETRIC DATA AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT MORE TIGHTENED DOES THAT EXACTLY WE WE'D LIKE IT TO BE TIGHTENED TO THE TYPE OF BIOMETRIC DATA LIKE -- RETINAL SCAN YOU KNOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF BY MUCH OF DATA THAT'S USED TO IDENTIFY A PERSON NOT LIKE BROWN HAIR NINE MY SHOE SIZE MY SERVING SIZE LIKE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. NOT A PHOTOGRAPH. YOU KNOW SOMEONE SPACE UNLESS IT'S LIKE -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE SCANNED PHOTO LIKE WHERE THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF IMAGING OF YOUR FACE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING WHERE THEY'RE USING IT TO SCAN YOUR FACE AND IDENTIFY YOU NATURAL PICTURE OF SOMEONE LIKE WE DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE BIOMETRIC DATA OKAY. IN AND THEN GOOD WELL I JUST WANT. TO POINT OUT THAT MICHELLE SURE DID HAVE A RESPONSE OKAY POINT IF YOU IF YOU LIKE SURE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS AND TAKE TAKE ON THAT A SHOE SIZE OR CLOTHING SIZE THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED BIOMETRIC DATA LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. I'M GOING TO JUST USE MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE. I AM A SIZE NINE SHOE AND NINE WEST BUT I'M A NINE AND A HALF SHE WHEN CLARKSON SO WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW THAT BY THE SIZE OF MY FOOT. THAT THAT THAT'S EASY RIGHT THERE AND SO THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC DATA -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S PERMANENT OR UNIQUE OR COLLECTIBLE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD WOULD VERY BASED ON YOU KNOW THE BRAND OF THE SHOE SIZE OF THE BRAND OF THE SHOE AND AND WHATNOT SO. THE TYPE OF DATA YOU KNOW IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IS IS DEEPLY UNIQUE AN INTRINSIC TO THE PERSON AS OPPOSED. TO SOMETHING THAT IS -- MUTABLE IN IN THE IS FASCINATING -- AS IT IS TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE SOME PERSONAL CONNECTION TO WHAT WHAT IS OUR BODY YOU AND YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY TALK AT GREAT LENGTH. ABOUT. AS MUCH AS WERE NEGOTIATING OR TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT HERE AT THIS TABLE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE NEGOTIATING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LAND -- OUGHT WITH APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE AND I'VE GOT GREAT FAITH IN THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CHAMBER THAT WHILE WE MISSED THE HIGH FIVE GOING BY EACH OTHER THE FIRST TIME WE'RE GONNA GET BACK. AND AND HIT THAT HIGH FIVE ON THAT SECOND SECOND TRY -- WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE? IF YOU DO VIOLATE THIS. AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT UNDER THIS LEGISLATION WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE FOR SOMEONE THAT DID -- SO THEY HAVE THIS BREACH IN YEAH SO IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE CURRENT DATA BREACH OF VACATION LÃ . BUSINESSES NEED TO HAVE REASONABLE PROTECTIONS. AND SO THAT IS THAT IS MERELY WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE COLLECTING. GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS OR BIOMETRIC DATA THAT YOU USE THIS VERY SAME REASONABLE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING. FOR HEALTH INSURANCE INFORMATION THAT'S WITH YOUR NAME FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS THE THE BASIS OF WHAT ANYONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND SO LONG AS THEY'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE REASONABLY. TRYING TO PRACTICE INFORMATION THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT THERE'S A SUPPOSED TO ALONG WITH THE NOTIFICATION OF COURSE AND THAT'S I WILL CREDIT IN AMERICA READ BUT WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT OF THEY DID. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION -- IN THE THE SAME RECOURSE UNDER THE DATA BREACH OF HAITIAN LAW SO -- AND I'LL AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. THE DEPUTY SUPERVISING ATTORNEY GENERAL ANSWER THAT IF -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET MORE INTO THAT BUT IT'S IT'S A PRETTY. MUCH USING THE EXISTING LAW FROM TWO THOUSAND TWO AND JUST UPDATING WHAT PEOPLE ARE COLLECTING ABOUT SHOW. SO IN TERMS OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW IN THE CAN FOR COMPETITION LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TO BE BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR CITY ATTORNEYS ARE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IF THERE'S A VIOLATION OF A LOT OF CONSTITUTE UNLAWFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE AND SUBJECT. A COMPANY -- FOR TO CIVIL PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -- AND SO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A VIOLATION IF IF IF FOR EXAMPLE BUSINESS WAS NOT RECENTLY PROTECTING BIOMETRIC DATA DATA OR GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDENTIFIER -- FOR IT YOU KNOW THEY WERE FOUND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DELAY AND AFTER SUFFERING A BRIDGE AND THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED AND NOTIFYING THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED. THAT COULD CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR FINDING THAT THERE WAS AN UNLAWFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION IT'S BROUGHT BY. MY OFFICE OR BY MY LOCAL COUNTERPARTS -- WITH THAT WOULD INCLUDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. THE IT'S NOT WITHIN THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE ITSELF BUT THERE IS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITHIN CCPA -- THAT DOESN'T REFERENCE ONE ONE STATUE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AMENDED LEGISLATION TODAY RIGHT SO I MEAN. JUST IF WE CAN GET DOWN TO THAT SO COULD SOMEONE BRING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR A VIOLATION OF IF WE PASS THIS BILL INTO LAW COULD SOMEONE BRING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THIS KIND OF REACH. UNDERSEA CPA YES OKAY BUT IF THAT'S IT BUT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT THRESHOLD QUESTION THAT YOU WOULD IT'S NOT JUST A VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE THEY WOULD HAVE TO SHOW WITH THE CPA REQUIRES IN ORDER TO SUCCEED AND ON THAT WHEN I REASONABLE YOU DIDN'T HAVE REASONABLE PROTECT YOU. YOU CAN'T JUST SU AND THEN WHEN LIKE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVE THAT THEY DIDN'T PROTECT YOUR WRITING ON THIS AND I REALIZE THAT I'M MISSING. AT THAT REMEDY THAT OKAY FINAL QUESTION IS REALLY MORE FOR THE G. -- ONE THING THAT DOES CONCERN ME ABOUT SOME OF THIS IS WHAT WE'RE REQUIRE IN THIS OF BUSINESSES I THINK WE SHOULD. BUT YOU KNOW HAS A LOT OF GOVERNMENT ISSUED INFORMATION AND BIOMETRIC DATA. THE GOVERNMENT. RIGHT. SO WHEN THEY BLEAK DAY ARE SOMEHOW. NEO GET DATA OUT THERE ARE MAYBE. ACCIDENTALLY GIVE OUT PURCHASE PRIVATE INFORMATION -- TWO GROUPS. SHOULD THE SAME RECOURSE BE THERE AGAINST GOVERNMENT. FOR THIS AS WELL AND I DON'T SEE THAT IN THIS BILL BUT MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER I MEAN. I WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER AS THEY SAY RIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES ALSO REQUIRE THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT TWENTY NINE BE AMENDED SO THAT DOES APPLY. TO WHEN IN THE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THERE BUT LIKE SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE AND SPEAKING IN CODE. FOR THAT REQUIRES THAT SEVENTY NINE TWENTY NINE SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT pREQUIRES THAT WHEN A STATE AGENCY THAT HOLDS THE SAME DATA POINTS. HAS SUFFERED A BREACH THAT THEY MAY MUST ALSO PROVIDE NOTICE. READ THAT SECTION ONE OF THE BILL SO WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT SECTION ONE OF THE BILL SO FAR WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SECOND TO IN SECTION THIRTEEN BUT SO IS A STATE AGENCY THAT THAT DOES SUFFER A DATA BREACH. ALSO HAS THE SAME OBLIGATIONS. UNDER THE STATUTE TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THAT DATA BREACH OKAY AND IF THEY DEL. THE CONSEQUENCE IS. SO THAT I AM IN THE DOJ BRING PENALTIES AGAINST ITSELF -- THAT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION THAT I'VE NOT BAD DID NOT PREPARE FOR BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT I NEED TO FILE A CLAIM THE GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. THING BEFORE RIGHT AND I HAVE A PROBLEM DAM LEAD INTO THAT. BUT I WOULD EXPECT THE ANYBODY'S BEEN PAID YET SO. BUT LOOK I MEAN I THINK THIS IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE THE FUTURE IS LIKE A WERE REQUIRING THIS OF ALL THESE BUSINESSES BUT WE SHOULD REQUIRE THE SAME. OF GOVERNMENT AND THERE SHOULD BE REAL PENALTIES AND CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT THE GOVERNMENT. PREACHES THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS JUST IS JUST AS MUCH OF A RISK. MAYBE MAYBE IN SOME CASES GREATER. I'M WRITING IT DOWN THINKING. ON IT'S GOOD OF MISTER OBERNOLTE AND ENOUGH FOLLOWED BY MISS WICKS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MR LEVINE MINE ANALYSIS HAS A OPPOSE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS I DISAGREE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED AN IMPORTANT POINT. AND THE POINT A TO RAISING IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OF DATA THAT HAVE UNIQUE POTENTIAL TO BE USED FOR IDENTITY THEFT AND THOSE DESERVE TO BE HELD. TO A HIGHER STANDARD PROTECTION THAN OTHER KINDS OF DATA AND I I TOOK COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT AND SO I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT BUT I'M ALSO SYMPATHETIC. TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AT IN PARTICULAR. THE ISSUE THAT -- THE BILL IS SO BROAD THAT IT INCLUDES A LOT OF DATA THAT DOESN'T FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. AND IN PARTICULARLY PARTICULAR AYE AYE I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRIC DATA BECAUSE FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT BY MATTER DATE AS ANYTHING THAT I COLLECT. YEAH IN AN AUTOMATED WAY. FROM A HUMAN USER SO OFTEN FOR EXAMPLE MY WATCH KNOWS WHAT MY RESTING HEART RATE WAS AND HOW FAST MY FASTEST MILE WAS THIS WEEK. WHICH WAS NOT VERY FAST AMEND THE SUSPENSE. BUT I MEAN THAT DATA IS NOT USEFUL TO SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO STEAL MY IDENTIFICATION. IN. A SIMILARLY GOVERNMENT ISSUED ID IS -- AS THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED. A PASSPORT A NUMBER WAS CERTAINLY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE ELSE. HOWEVER A FISHING LICENSE NUMBER YOU KNOW IF I TRY TO OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT WITHOUT YOU KNOW REALLY NOT SO MUCH THAT'S THAT'S NOT IS IT IS DAMAGING SO -- I'M I GUESS I'M ASKING WHAT IS YOUR COMMITMENT LEVEL TO WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL YEAH I'LL REPEAT THE THE METAPHOR I USED EARLIER LIKE WE'VE LITERALLY ALMOST HIGH FIVES ON AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK. FOR A SECOND ROUND OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE DEFINITIONS IN PLACE THAT -- I THINK WE'LL. DIED DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITIONS CONCERNS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY I FEEL -- I'M ALSO GRATEFUL NOT JUST FOR THEIR LEVEL OF INTERACTION BUT ALSO FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF AS WELL -- THERE IS A LOT OF STAFF TIME -- TO MATCH THE CHAMBERS INTEREST AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. AND AND SO MY COMMITMENT IS THERE. OKAY WELL THANK YOU WITH THAT I'M GONNA MAKE SURE YOU THAT WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS AND WE AND WE'RE I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HUNTING LICENCES A FISHING LICENSE AND THAT KIND OF THING EITHER BECAUSE DEFINITELY NOT YOUR LIBRARY DON'T. SEE THEM AS IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF THE MATTER HERE SO WE'RE TRYING REAL HARD THIS. IN A SWEET SPOT THAT LANGUAGE IT GETS IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND NOT DOCUMENTS THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE PRESIDENTE MAKING. ALL RIGHT WELL SO WITH A COMMITMENT -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE THIS AGAIN APPROPRIATIONS OF NOT BEFORE SO -- ALLSTATE TODAY AND HOPE THAT YOU GET TO A PLACE WHERE WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT'S IN ON A PRO APPROPRIATE BLIND. THANKS FOR THE WORK ON THIS THOUGH. THANK YOU MUCH I WAS GOING TO MISS WICKS FOLLOWED BY MR FONG. YEAH AND JUST I KNOW THAT REPRESENTATIVE WHO'S REPRESENTING ACLU IN COMMONSENSE BEING OTHERS REYES -- CONCERN AROUND OR WANTED TO REQUEST AMENDMENTS ARE ON THE BIOMETRIC DATA AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE. YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION AND WOULD BE LISTING THEM HAVING THEM AT THE TABLE -- COMPLY EVERYONE'S GOT A SEAT AT THE TABLE IT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT CONCERNS FROM THE CHAMBER THAT WANT A NARROWING AND THEN THE WE HAVE CONCERNS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT WANT A BROADENING. AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE. AND TAKE ALL OF THAT INPUT TO TO GET TO THAT POINT. MS FUNK AHEAD. I JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- I AND I KNOW TO THIS THE SECOND INDIVIDUAL THE TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION -- INDICATED SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM ILLINOIS WHERE THERE WAS A RISE IN A AND LAWSUITS A BASED ON A LOT THEY PASS I WAS WONDERING HOW SIMILAR IS THIS -- BILL TO WHAT EXISTS IN ILLINOIS AND MAYBE THE GENERAL CAN COME BACK UP AND KIND OF SHED SOME LIGHT IN TERMS OF THE ILLINOIS EXPERIENCE. I APOLOGIZE FOR BRING BACK UP. TO MY UNDERSTANDING THE ILLINOIS LAW IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT REQUIRES -- BUSINESSES TO DISCLOSE AND OBTAIN CONSENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN BIOMETRIC DATA AND USE BIOMETRIC DATA. THIS IS JUST THE DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION LAW HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN LAWSUITS -- IN ILLINOIS ALLEGING THAT THE MERE. EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER AND A THIRD PARTY SUCH AS THE USE OF A BIOMETRIC TIME CLOCKS. SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH THE PAYROLL COMPANY IN PROCESS PAYROLL CONSIDERED AN AUTHORIZED BREACH. OKAY NOT A CONCERT AND ARE THERE SIMILARITIES THE BILL IN QUESTION TO THE ILLINOIS LAW. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR -- THE ILLINOIS LAW AS I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW. HAD HAD HAD JUST NOTED THAT THE DEFINITE THE ILLINOIS COURT -- FOUND THAT THERE WAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THAT CASE AS WELL AND THERE WAS -- IT WAS UP HELL TO THE PRIVATE ACTION WAS UPHELD BECAUSE THE COURT FOUND THAT THE VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE OF THE PRIVACY INTERESTS WAS SO SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT NOTICED BEFORE -- THE BIOMETRIC DATA WAS TAKEN AND SO THE THE STATUTE THERE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAT IS THAT IS A STATUTE THAT IS PROTECTING -- THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE NOTIFIED BEFORE BIOMETRIC DATA IS IS. IS USED IN THIS CASE IT WAS LIKE A A MINOR WAS ATTENDING AN AMUSEMENT PARK AND THAT A SCAN OF THEIR I THINK IT WAS THERE THAT THEIR FACE OR THEIR FINGERPRINT WAS TAKEN. IN ORDER TO GAIN ENTRY AND SO THERE WAS NO NOTICE TO THE TO THE PARENTS UP TO THE MINOR'S PARENT -- BUT IMPORTANTLY THERE THE THE REQUIREMENT IN THE ILLINOIS A LOT WAS THAT BEFORE BIOMETRIC DATA IS TAKEN BUT IT IN ADDITION TO THE CONSENT PROVISION. THEIR REQUIREMENT IS ALSO THAT THE BIOMETRIC DATA IS SAFEGUARDED AND SO THAT IS SIMILAR TO SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT ONE POINT FIVE WHICH REQUIRES REASONABLE SAFEGUARDS HERE. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE AS WELL AND THAT WAS UP HELD BY THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT AS IN IN TERMS OF THE THE THE LOBBYING PRESERVED. SURE COMMENT ON THAT JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ILLINOIS LOT ALL I JUST MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT DID INCLUDE OR DOES INCLUDE PHOTOGRAPHS. AND THAT IS A CONCERN OF OURS THAT THAT WOULD BE WAY TOO BROAD BECAUSE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE BRINGING IN. CONTENT ON THE WEB SECURITY CAMERAS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT HAS A PICTURE OF A PERSON NOW IS BIOMETRIC DATA AND WE'RE JUST WORRIED THAT'S ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT ADDING NOT ONLY REDUCE WHAT REGIONAL SECURITY BUT THEN THE VERY SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY DAMAGES NO PROOF OF INJURY LIABILITY WITH THE C. C. PA THAT IS TIED TO THAT SECTION. BUT IT'S JUST YOU'RE GONNA BE OR WHAT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU INCLUDED PHOTOGRAPHS BUT I THINK IT INCLUDED FEAST GEOMETRY THAT WAS GLEANED FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH SO IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH ITSELF IT'S NOT LIKE THE THE PICTURE IT'S WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY. DOES WHEN IT'S PROCESSING THE THE THE FACIAL GEOMETRY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT RIGHT NOW -- INVOLVING A CAN OF AT THAT THAT QUESTION I I DID MINISTER OF A BACK AND FORTH BUT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT NO NO AND I AND AT THAT THE THE INFORMATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK MY BROADER POINT IS THAT SINCE OTHER STATES HAVE UNDERTAKEN SIMILAR EFFORTS THAT WE TAKE THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS AND WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED POSTS. AB IMITATION OF A NUMBER THESE LAWS SO THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES -- OR CAUSE ANY UNNECESSARY LITIGATION OR OR OR HARM. TO THE TO THE ONLY THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE BUT TO THE CONSUMERS AT LARGE SO I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THERE ARE TWELVE STATES AB TWELVE OR I'M SORRY. YOUR TWELVE STATES THAT CURRENTLY COVER BIOMETRIC DATA IN THEIR BREACH NOTIFICATION LAWS AND WITH THAT. EIGHT IN TERMS OF THE TWELVE STATES DO WE MODEL THIS BILL AFTER SPECIFIC STATES ARE WE TAKE PICK AND CHOOSE THE THE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE STATE WE DID WE TRY TO HARMONIZE THE DEFINITION WITH THOSE OTHER STATE THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT DON'T EVEN DEFINED BIOMETRIC DATA AND THEIR STATUTE. THEY JUST SIMPLY SAY BIOMETRIC DATA AND SO WE CHOSE TO USE A LITTLE BIT MORE LANGUAGE FOR PURPOSES OF OF CLARITY BUT YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SURE AND AS AS THIS DEVELOP SOME I'M SURE WE'LL GET MORE. AT WILL GET MORE SPECIFICS AS IT AS IT INVOLVES BUT I PROJECT INFORMATION THANK YOU. I SEE NO OTHER MISTER I WENT AHEAD -- YES TODAY I AM GOING TO BE OF STANDING ON YOUR BILL AYE I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT BIOMETRIC AND AND INFORMATION LIKE PASSPORT NUMBERS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE C. C. P. A PA AND I WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT. UNDO THE COMPROMISE THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR. AND BE REALLY DELIVERED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA BE SUBJECT TO THE P. R. A. -- WITHIN CCPA AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT ALL BY MEAN AYE I REALLY THINK A LOT OF THESE DEFINITIONS HAVE TO BE -- TIGHTENED UP AND I HOPE THAT. THE SPONSOR AND AN AUTHOR WILL WORK WITH AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TIGHTEN UP THOSE. OF DEFINITIONS AND AND CERTAINLY -- IF YOU COME TO A CONSENSUS I'M -- WILLING TO VOTE FOR THIS ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS METHOD. AND I THINK THE AUTHOR AND AND THE SPONSOR FOR YOUR INFORMATION TODAY AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I JUST ECHO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE VERY BROAD. DEFINITIONS PRESENTED HERE WHICH I THINK -- OUR OWNER IS ON BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- THOSE THE ISSUE ID'S THAT MIGHT FALL IN THIS PURVIEW PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF STATE AGENCIES I'M THINKING SPECIFICALLY THE DMV CURRENTLY TASKED WITH THE RESOURCES AT HAND IN DELIVERING THE SERVICES NECESSARY THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT THEY HAVE ON THAT END. SO ENSURING THAT WE REALLY REFINE THESE DEFINITIONS TO A PLACE WHERE THIS IS A MANAGEABLE I THINK IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND AND I TO PLAN TO SIT THIS ONE OUT. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE ITSELF LET ME LET ME ON I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE DISCUSSION AND I'M I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT THE PARTIES ARE COMMUNICATING IN NEGOTIATING. AND SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SO THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. AND ONE OF WHICH IS THE ARE -- TO RECONCILE THE DEFINITION OF BIOMETRICS -- BETWEEN YOUR BILL OF MISTER LEVINE AND A C. C. P. A.'S DEFINITION OF BIOMETRICS. AT ITSELF NO QUESTION THAT THE THE THERE'S AN UPTICK IN THE A NUMBER OF THE FREQUENCY AND ALSO THE MAGNITUDE OF DATA BREACHES -- NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ACROSS THE NATION AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I AND I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AT NOW IS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. OUR AS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL CCPA ARE I AM VERY ALSO ALL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE THE THE ISSUE OF EXPANDING. OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT A DIRECT EXPANSION OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE AUSSIE CPA ALSO PROTECTS PASSPORT AS WELL AS MY MAJOR INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH WE NEED TO LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE NEED TO RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCE THE THE DEFINITION AND INFO. FOR BILL FOR LEGISLATION. AND DOT SO I YOU KNOW WITH THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH A STAKEHOLDERS I FEEL COMFORTABLE. ALL LEADING THE BILL HALL AND IN SUPPORTING IT TODAY AS WELL BUT I DO ENCOURAGE ALL THE PARTIES SO BASICALLY ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUE WORKING. ON NON NARROWING IT DEFINITION AND ALSO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BILL -- SO TO WITHOUT AYE AYE I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY MR LEVINE. AND DAVE I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR CAUGHT A QUESTIONS AND I'M GONNA HOUSE -- FOR A MOTION. THE BILL HASN'T BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL S. AUTOMOTIVE -- TECHNOLOGY HAS -- PROGRESS THE INDUSTRY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN MOBILIZING AND INTEGRATING ADVANCED COMPUTER HARDWARE INTO EVEN THE MOST BASIC AUTOMOBILES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN CLEANER. RUNNING MORE EFFICIENT MORE RELIABLE AND PERHAPS MORE NOTICEABLY MORE COMFORTABLE VEHICLES TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD TO CONSUMERS. THESE ADVANCEMENTS HOWEVER HAVE OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW AVENUES OF RISK AND RISK ASSESSMENTS. THE HARDWARE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED FOR THE SAID ADVANCEMENTS ARE FAR MORE CAN TO THE CAPABILITIES FOUND IN HIGH POWER HOME PC OR SMARTPHONE. IN ANY VEHICLE MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH. AND BRING WITH THEM ALL THE SAME DANGERS FOR EXPLOITATION. A BAD ACTOR MAY ACCESS THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS ARE TO DOWNLOAD A RECORD OF THE VEHICLES LOCATION FOR EXAMPLE THEY CAN ALSO UTILIZE THE VEHICLES ONBOARD MICROPHONE. TO SPY ON UNSUSPECTING OCCUPANTS OR THEY MAY UTILIZED VEHICLES WIRELESS SERVICE AREAS. TO SIMPLY STEELED OF YOU CALL TOGETHER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF STREAMING FILE ITEM THREE MISTER CHAIRMAN A BEAST. NINE SEVEN SIX PRETTY WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN OUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SO. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OR A AYE HAS AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO CREATE A GLOBAL PARADIGM. SHIFT THAT MAY PROPEL SOCIETY INTO A AUTO AUTOMATION AGE AND PROPOSED UNIQUE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST PROBLEMS. ITS APPLICATION MAY SOON BECOME IMMERSED IN EVERY MAJOR AREA OF OUR WORK AND PERSONALIZE. SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION COMMUNICATIONS FINANCE HEALTH CARE SERVICES EMERGENCY RESPONSE SERVICES EDUCATION. COMMUNITY PLANNING CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND ALSO ENTERTAINMENT JUST TO NAME A FEW. WHILE THIS -- EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES IT ALSO COMES WITH ITS OWN CHALLENGES INCLUDING POTENTIALLY DISPLACING WORKERS. LOSS OF PRIVACY OR REINFORCING INSTITUTIONAL BIASES AMONG OTHER THINGS. THESE LEGAL AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES WILL DEFINITELY REQUIRE INVOLVEMENT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS. ALL AND AS A RESULT WE TO LEGISLATORS PSALMIST FACILITATE OUT DIALOGUE TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR STATE'S POPULATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DRIVING INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY AS A LEADER. IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. ALL THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO BEGIN DOES -- NECESSARY CONVERSATIONS BY ESTABLISHING THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN STATE GOVERNMENT SERVICES COMMISSION. OUR TO GATHER INPUT ON HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA SCIENCE COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE STATE SERVICES. ON JOINING ME TODAY TO SO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF BILL IS THAT THE MARKET FOSTER FROM THE CALIFORNIA LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SEE WHEN READ. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TAMARA FOSTER I'M A SENIOR PROJECT MANAGER WITH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. OUR COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY -- BASED ON OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT -- HOPEFULLY ALL RECEIVED A COPY OF THIS -- IT'S CALLED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A ROAD MAP FOR CALIFORNIA. WE SUPPORT CREATING IN AN A. I. IN STATE GOVERNMENT SERVICES COMMISSION ASK DETAILED IN AB. NINE SEVEN SIX OUR REPORT WAS DEVELOPED FOLLOWING ELEVEN MONTHS OF STUDY THAT INCLUDED ONE PUBLIC HEARING AND TO ADVISORY MEDIANS IT WAS INFORMED BY CONVERSATIONS WITH NUMEROUS EXPERTS -- IN OUR REVIEW OF THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO USE A AYE FOR ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOOD. FOR EXAMPLE A I MIGHT HELP EMERGENCY RESPONDERS PROTECT RARE FIRES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR -- IN OUR PURVIEW WE ALSO FOUND THAT SOME STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS. BUT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE NOT PREPARING FOR AN A I. WORLD FOR PLANNING FOR WAYS TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY. TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF THEIR OWN PROGRAMS OR SERVICES. OUR STUDY PRODUCED SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE ONE MOST RELEVANT TODAY OF COURSE IS THE CREATION OF THE A. I. COMMISSION. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT WE NEED EXPERTS TO HELP US PLAN FOR THESE INEVITABLE CHANGES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A AYE. SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE THINKING REFLECTS THE COLLABORATION OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS UNIONS AND ACADEMIA. WE NEED TO DEVELOP A AYE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT PILOT HOW TO APPLY A AYE TO CRITICAL STATE SERVICES. AND WE NEED TO COLLECT DATA AND LEARN FROM THESE PROJECTS SO THAT WE CAN ULTIMATELY GROW THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE AB NINE SEVEN SIX SHARES THESE CALLS THE COMMISSION SUPPORTS THIS MEASURE AND URGES DRIVE UP TODAY. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEE SEE NINE AT BOAT. BOB THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS MUCH LIGHTER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE JUST WANTED. TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS AND WORKER PROTECTIONS ARE ACTION ADEQUATELY INCLUDED. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAN REALLY ROSENBERG RESERVES EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE NOTICE BUT WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION -- AS NOT BY MY COLLEAGUE WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE A LEADER ON THIS ISSUE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO ADDRESSING IT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR. HAS A PROPOSAL OF HIS OWN THERE'S ANOTHER BILL IN THE SENATE AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD WE DO IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE. AND THOUGHTFUL WAY -- THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT THOUGHTFULLY -- AND WITHOUT HE'S BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF IMPACT ON OUR CITIZENS IT HAS -- A I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SHOW BIAS DISCRIMINATION -- AND GENDER ISSUES SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE ALL ADDRESS NOT THOUGHTFUL WAY AS WELL AS LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THE WORK FORCE IS PROTECTED THANK YOU. I THINK IT WAS MORE NEUTRAL BUT OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN NO LONGER SO IN SUPPORT OR NEUTRAL. OKAY AND THEN ANYONE IS IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE[inaudible] WICKS -- I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF FOLKS FROM SCA YOU INTO THE LABOR FED -- AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE WORK WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE THIS HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR WORK FORCE AND JUST REALLY ENSURING THAT LABOR IS REALLY FRONT CENTER IN THE CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE AND HELPING TO THINK FOR SOME THESE POLICIES IS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME SO. I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM GOOD CHARLOTTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHERUB PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED WITH YOU YOU ON THIS I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT WE RECEIVED THIS MORNING [inaudible] UP. EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION WE HAVE THESE CONCERNS THE SURFACE FROM -- PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISPLACED AND ACCOUNT OF THIS CALL THAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNEMPLOYMENT AND GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE FOR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION WITH A LOT OF ITS SPRING THE TEXTILE MILLS IN NINETEENTH CENTURY ENGLAND BUT EVERY TIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE. BOB THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THE WORKPLACE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHAT WE SEE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS FROM DISPLACEMENT. THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT ARE CREATED AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKERS FAR EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF JOBS THAT ARE DISPLACED SO. I MEAN I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO FACE THAT STARK REALITY IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUT NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED FEAR NECESSARILY. AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT -- THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE BILL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BEING MINDFUL ABOUT THE FATE OF THE WORKERS WHO WILL BE DISPLACED IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT THERE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE COMMISSION IS TO MAKE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF LABOR AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WORKERS IT'S MUCH BETTER TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IN A SETTING LIKE THE COMMISSION DOWN. IT IS JUST TO LET A I TO YOU KNOW IN THE WORKPLACE -- RUN ITS COURSE AND THEN BE REACTIVE LATER SO I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR WITHOUT THAT WITHOUT -- ON THE BILL AND CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING WORKING WITH USABLE FORWARDS. THANK YOU MUCH. I THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. I MISS BEST. I APPRECIATE -- THE AUTHORS -- TAKE ON THIS BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY EVEN ON OUR NATIONAL ELECTIONS THE USE OF A AYE DATA IN THE SENSE OF MEDI DATA BEING CLEANED AND THEN I'M USED AND MANIPULATED -- IS KIND OF STARTLING AND I THINK TAKING A REALLY BROAD LOOK AT THIS ACROSS THE STATE AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE WANT TO MANAGE NOT ONLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEFINE. A AYE IN LEGISLATION GOING FORWARD BUT ALSO I'M BEING HEAD ON THIS ISSUE IS -- PARTICULARLY PRESSION HAVE YOU SO I THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THIS. THANKS VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. A SINGING NUN WE'RE LOOKING FOR MOTION AS SECOND. MOTION AND SECOND MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE AMOUNTS AFTER A PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAU I SHOW AYE FONG. FUNG I BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] BERMAN. AND I WEBER. WEBER AYE MULLIN [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I OR NGUYEN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE? OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH. SMITH HI WEEKS. WICKS I BILLS. BILLS OUT. HELLO THE VOTE OPEN -- CONTINUING THE ED CHAU CHAU -- FONDER -- FIVE AB TWELVE OH TWO WELL IT HERE IT IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AB TWELVE OH TWO IS A STRAIGHT FOR BILL TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT IF THAT AFFECTS EVERY CONSUMER. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS THE BUYING AND SELLING OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION LAST YEAR BY ENACTING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THIS LEGISLATURE GAVE CALIFORNIANS. MANY OF THE NECESSARY TOOLS. TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION STARTING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. TO MONITOR AND CONTROL HOW THE DATA IS BEING USE SOLD OR OTHERWISE EXCHANGED. THESE RIGHTS HOWEVER ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE CONSUMERS POWER TO ENFORCE THEM. A KEY COMPONENT OF TAKING CHARGE IS SIMPLY KNOWING WHAT BUSINESSES ARE HOLDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO THAT END THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT DATA BROKERS DEFINED GENERALLY AS BUSINESSES THAT ARE BUYING AND OR SELLING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CONSUMERS. WITH WHOM THEY HAVE NO DIRECT. RELATIONSHIP. TO REGISTER WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD THEN BE REQUIRED TO CREATE A REGISTRY AND HOST THAT INFORMATION ON THAT. ON THEIR WEBSITE. THIS REGISTRY WILL PROVIDE AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCESSIBLE RESOURCE FOR CALIFORNIANS. WHO WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION THE REGISTRY MAY ALSO SERVE TO BENEFIT DATA BROKERS WHO HAVE SPECIFIC DUTIES ON THE TO CC PA? THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SATISFIED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP A WITH CONSUMERS. BY RECORDING DATA BROKERS TO REGISTER WITH THE STATE WE CAN TAKE A SMALL LEGISLATIVE STEP. THAT IMPOSES MINIMAL ARE BURDENS ON THE BUSINESSES WHO BENEFIT FROM THE EXCHANGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND AT THE SAME TIME EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU -- ANYWAY ASSISTANCE OF SPEAKING IN SUPPORT HI -- PROGRAM PRESENT A COALITION. OF COMPANIES TO PROVIDE PEOPLE SEARCH SERVICES WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THIS BILL PARTICULARLY SINCE IT WILL FACILITATE. CONSUMER OPT OUT OPT OUT RIGHTS ARE COMPANIES REGISTERED VERMONT WE'RE GLAD TO BE REGISTER HERE CALIFORNIA. AT THE SAME TIME THAT SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN. EXPRESSED ABOUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES POSSIBLE OVER OVER BREATH -- WE HAVE A VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND GLAD TO CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS ARE CONSUMER PRIVACY PLACE TO BE IN SUPPORT. I THANK YOU SEEN OTHER WHO AS MEMBERS. OF THE PUBLIC WANTS BECAUSE FOR ANY MEMBERS OF OTHERWISE PICKING OPPOSITION. MAY I PLEASE PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON-- REPRESENT THE ASSOCIATION OF NATIONAL ADVERTISERS -- BE HAVE A COALITION OF THE ADVERTISING TRADES AND I WOULD HATE IT WHEN I'M THE ONLY -- ONE BUT HERE I AM [inaudible] THE ASSOCIATION NATIONAL ADVERTISERS -- THE HELP GENERATE A SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND GENERATES TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION JOBS ANNUALLY. A CONVERSATION EARLIER -- ON A PREVIOUS BILL -- I THINK IS -- SET A RELEVANT TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE -- THE CCPA WHICH HAS IS TO YOU KNOW INCREDIBLY AMBITIOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED A AND NUMBER OF NUMBER FOLKS HERE -- ON THE ON THE DAY US ARE ALSO AUTHORS OF BILLS TO TRY TO FIX -- PARTS OF IT INCLUDING INCLUDING THE CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. THIS BILL WOULD. AT THE CITY WOULD CREATE A I THINK AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE WORKING ON ALL THE OTHER CCPA STUFF. CERTAINLY ANOTHER LEVEL OF I THINK COMPLICATION THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST. PERHAPS WAIT UNTIL WOULD GO THROUGH ALL THE C. C. P. A. RELATED RELATED THINGS. WE BELIEVE THAT BEFORE AN ACTING ADDITIONAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS THAT TIME FIRST BE GIVEN TO THE AG IS IN THE PROCESS OF ISSUING REGULATIONS -- THEY'VE HAD FIVE PUBLIC FORUMS FOR FIVE OR SIX THE REGULATIONS ARE DUE OUT IN THE FALL. BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER LEGISLATION -- RELATED TO THE C. CPA. THAT IS STILL BEING DEALT WITH -- AND IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED THAT HAVE THE REGULATIONS ON GOING AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE DEALING WITH C. C. P. A. ISSUES. IS SORT OF LIKE PLAYING THREE DIMENSIONAL CHESS AND IT'S REALLY TRUE -- TWELVE OH TWO A. B. TWELVE A TWO WE THINK WILL WILL ADD TO THAT LEVEL OF COMPLICATION WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND -- OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET AFTER I THINK WE WE WOULD ASK THAT MAYBE WE SLOW THINGS DOWN AND ALLOW. ONE THING AT A TIME TO HAPPEN AS WE TRY TO PUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS TOGETHER -- THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT WE DOES DOES NOT BELIEVE PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH NEWER HELPFUL INFORMATION AND COULD RESULT IN SOME CONSUMER CONFUSIONS. WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH OPT OUT PROVISIONS OF SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS THAT IT BE DONE IN IN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. NOT A SEPARATE. BILL -- GIVEN THE RECENT PASSAGE OF CC GIVE BE A WHICH WILL CREATE STILL UNFORESEEN CHANGES TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. AND WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED THROUGH RULE MAKING IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE STATE'S INFORMATION PRIVACY LAWS ARE CAREFULLY CRAFTED. TO WORK WITH AND INTEROPERABLE SCHEME. OF FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE WOULD ASK THAT MAYBE SLOW THINGS DOWN KINDA LOOK AT ALL THIS IT'S SORT OF COMPREHENSIVELY WITHIN THE CC PA -- AND IF WE FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- THAT MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT IT LATER BUT RIGHT NOW WE WOULD -- WE WOULD ASK THAT -- THE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO STAY POST. I THANK FOR MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL. A WITNESSES IN ORDER INDIVIDUALS BEGIN OPPOSITION. BRIEFLY -- SERRA BOOT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER I'M HERE TO TESTIFY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- AS ALWAYS WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THIS AUTHOR AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH YOUR OFFICE BUT OUR CONCERNS UNFORTUNATELY WERE ABLE TO GET OUR POSITION. LINED UP BY THE LETTER DEADLINES WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- WE ALSO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT -- IN THE INTENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THE AUTHOR CALLS OUT THE MANY POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DATA BROKERS MAKE TO OUR MODERN ECONOMY AND TO ENABLE CRUCIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO MOVE FORWARD. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT A LOT -- JUST OUR MAIN CONCERNS ARE THAT -- THE BILL I HAVE REFERENCES SOME OF THE BROAD DEFINITIONS IN THE C. C. K. WHICH COULD LEAD TO WERE CONCERNED -- MORE BUSINESSES REGISTERING IS DATA BROKERS AND ACTUALLY ARE WHICH COULD LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION AND THERE'S JUST SOME LANGUAGE SECONDLY IN THE BILL THAT WERE WORRIED COULD -- COULD BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE OBLIGATIONS OF DATA BROKERS THAT CONFLICT WITH OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SEA CPA I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT AT ALL AND WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR SOME CLARIFICATION OUT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. CAN WITH YOUR OFFICE THE VERY MUCH. I ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK AND WE HAVE TO CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. HOW WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSE BASED UPON THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED THANK YOU? I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE NO OTHER SPEAKERS OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THROWING OUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL MISTER JOHN -- MAYBE YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS SO THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO IMPOSE A FEE. ON DATA BROKERS. NOT TO EXCEED THE REASONABLE COST OF REGULATION BUT THAT'S ALL IT SAYS. AND DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY COST OF REGULATION TO ME THE COST OF JUST MAINTAINING THE REGISTRY AND THE WEBSITE. THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER YOUR BILL OR DO YOU MEAN -- SO THE INVESTIGATION THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD DO INVOLVING DATA BROKERS TO ENFORCE OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIA LAW INCLUDING THE CCPA. ON WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AG DOESN'T INCUR ANY COSTS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE. TO RECOVER SO IN ESSENCE I THINK OF IT -- IT'S AN UBER WHO'S YOU KNOW REFERENCE IS THE THE THE COST THAT'S GONNA INCUR BY THE AG SO TO MAINTAIN THAT WEBSITE AND THEN TO MAINTAIN. OUR YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY FOR THE REGISTRY ITSELF WHATEVER TO REGISTRY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE AG'S GONNA. ARE HOPEFULLY RECOVER OKAY WELL WHAT ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS BY THE A. G. M. TWO PRACTICES BY DATA BROKERS THAT VIOLATE OTHER THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED VIOLATE OTHER USE OF CALIFORNIA STATE LAWS THE COST. OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS RECOVERABLE. UNDER YOU KNOW INCLUDING IS THAT INCLUDED IN THE COST OF REGULATION THAT'S NOT BEING MENTIONED IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK IF THE AG HAS. TO CONDUCT ANY INVESTIGATION ARE YOU KNOW PURSUANT TO ANY PORTION OF THE LAW THEN THERE'S PROBABLY ARE A PROVISION THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR THAT WHICH I COULD LOOK INTO THAT WOULD BE MORE BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T PROVIDE. FOR FOR THAT BECAUSE THE RECOVERY OKAY WELL IN THAT MY PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT IT DOESN'T. I THINK THAT. STE -- SOMEONE THAT WAS CREATIVE YOU KNOW IN THE SOME FUTURE DATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE COULD CLAIM THAT THEY THEY COULD ALSO RECOVER THOSE COSTS AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY MINDFUL WHEN WE PUT LANGUAGE LIKE THAT IN A BILL -- YOU KNOW WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF THERE WERE SOME KIND OF REASONABLE MAXIMUM SAID IN THERE WHICH THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR AND MANY OTHERS ARE AREAS OF STATE LARGER. AWARE YOU KNOW NOT TO EXCEED A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD GIVE ME SOME MORE COMFORT SO I'LL BE OPPOSING TODAY BUT YOU KNOW HOPEFUL HOPEFUL TO SEE -- MY MIND CHANGE THE FUTURE THAT'S A GOOD SUGGESTION WILL MAKE SURE WE CLARIFIED THE LANGUAGE MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T REALLY. COVER ANY INVESTIGATIVE CALL SO IT CARE INC OF IDG THANK YOU. A BUT THE FOR THAT M. AS IN MERRY SMITH. I AM THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE BILL IN A BUT I SHARE THE CONCERNS OUTLOOK ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM DECEMBER DINO AYE I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY AROUND THAT COST. A RECOUP [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR WAS THAT CLOSE I'M SURE -- I JUST THE LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR IDOL -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW OF THE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE FOR ME. TO RESPOND TO THE THE ASSERTION BROUGHT BY THE OPPOSITION BUT IF NOT THEN I'LL JUST LEAVE IT. TO FIND THAT'S FINE. RIGHT. WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. MOTION SECONDED THE MOTION IS TO DO PASS APPROPRIATIONS MM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. NOW I KNOW I FONG NO. PHONE NO [inaudible] BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] BERMAN. BERMAN I WEBER. HOWEVER I MULLIN [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I'D IRWIN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE? OBERNOLTE NO SMITH. SMITH I WICKS. WITH. THE BILL. BILLS OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AVAILABLE OPEN FOR OF ABSENT MEMBERS AL AND LAST ITEM ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN -- IN MEMBERS. OUR I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH UPDATE THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE. AND ALSO RESTRUCTURING THE PENALTY PROVISIONS. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WOULD INFORM CONSUMERS WITH A POSTED SIGN IF HE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OR F. R. T.. ON IN SHORT WHICH IS THE APPLICATION OF BIOMETRICS SOFTWARE USED TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL FROM A DIGITAL IMAGE OR VIDEO FRAMES. ARM THE TECHNOLOGY IS BECOMING EVER MORE -- PRESENT THROUGHOUT BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND CONCERNS OF PRIVACY AND USE OF THE INFORMATION ARE INCREASING. IN FACT A NEW STUDY ALSO RAISES BROADER QUESTIONS OF FAIRNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGARDS THE TO THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF F. R. T. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN INVESTMENT IN AND ADOPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS RACING AHEAD. FOR EXAMPLE A TWENTY EIGHTEEN TESTS OF R. F. R. T. SHOWS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IN CORRECTLY IDENTIFY TWENTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. AS PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. THE RECENT PUBLICATION DETAIL HOW THE SECURITY MEASURES OF ONE POP STAR INCLUDE FRT TO CAPTURE THE PICTURES OF CONCERTGOERS IN ORDER TO TRACK DOWN STALKERS. ADDITIONALLY THE EXTENT AND PREVALENCE OF RETAIL STORES USING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR INCREASED MARKETABILITY IS DISTURBING. IT APPEARS THAT IN BOTH CASES -- INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT INFORMED THAT F. R. T. WAS BEING USED ON THEM. NOR WOULD THEY KNOW HOW LONG THE INFORMATION IS HELD AND HOW. IT WILL BE USED AB -- TWELVE TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WAS SIMPLY. MAKE CONSUMERS AWARE OF WHICH BUSINESSES ARE YOU USING A FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. ARM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I WILL. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. THE PUBLIC. HAS SEEN NINE ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BURGER GLAD SHE ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION -- WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS AND HAVE A GREAT CONCERNS WE ARE OPPOSED TO IT IN LESS AMENDED YOU HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT ANOTHER MATTER HE TECH -- WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE LATE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR A RETAILER -- HAVING ANY LAW GOING TO FACT ON JANUARY ONE AFTER THE BUSY SEASON OF THE YEAR FOR US IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SO WE APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. FOR THAT AMENDMENT -- WE DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE NEW AMENDMENT THAT THE CHAIR JUST A BECAUSE AT SORRY WITH THAT THE AUTHOR JUST ACCEPTED -- THE PENALTY THAT GOES UP 21% OF A COMPANY'S NET INCOME FOUR EIGHT INTERNATIONALLY TRADED COMPANY OR INTERNATIONALLY OPERATING COMPANY COULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND FOR MANY LARGE RETAILERS COULD BE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FOR FAILURE TO POST A SIGN SO WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON A POTENTIAL PENALTY PROVISION -- WE HAD. TO I JUST LIKE TO FOR REFERENCE FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO POINT OUT. TO THE COMMITTEE WHAT THE VIOLATION IS FOR FAILURE FOR SALE IT SORRY FOR SELLING CIGARETTES TO MINORS -- EACH TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST INSTANT OFFENSE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND OFFENSE AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE THIRD OFFENSE -- WE THINK THAT IS. A STARTING POINT TO WORK BACK FROM BECAUSE CANDIDLY WE THINK FAILURE TO POST A SIGN. DOESN'T REACH THE SAME LEVEL OF HARM AS SELLING CIGARETTES TO MINORS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON A PENALTY PROVISION AND SEE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A REASONABLE COMPROMISE THAT. FURTHERS HIS GOAL OF MAKING SURE THE SIGNS ARE POSTED BUT DOESN'T HARM A COMPANY WHO RUNS AFOUL OF THE LAW BECAUSE SOMEBODY GRAB TO SIGN IT TAKES IT DOWN OR ONE DOOR IS INADVERTENTLY NOT MARKED APPROPRIATELY SO WE CAN TAKE TO WORK WITH HIM BUT FOR NOW OPPOSE UNLESS. AMENDED. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN A POSITION. THEIR BOOT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER WE WOULD A LINER AB. POSITION WITH THAT OF THE RETAILERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OH SORRY MY APOLOGIES. THERE WILL BE A QUICK TODAY. ACTUALLY -- MY APOLOGIES MISTER CHAIR OF KEVIN BACON FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT YET HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME. WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONCERN FOR THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS INFORMATION IT'S LIKE DNA IT'S LIKE FINGERPRINT SUCH A UNIQUE. A BIOMETRIC IDENTIFIER WHEN THEY TAKE A FACE PRINT OF YOU. WE WE WOULD URGE THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER PERHAPS OBSTRUCTING THE BILL WHEN WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT A SIGN IS NECESSARILY THE MOST PROTECTIVE. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GIVE FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO EXPRESS CONSENT TO OPT IN TO TO THAT MEASURE YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THESE PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE SIGNS THAT WE WE ALMOST DON'T SEE ANYMORE RIGHT AND IF WE DO SEE WE WE KIND OF JUST REGARD BECAUSE REALLY WHAT. CAN WE DO -- SO WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO KIND OF STRENGTH AND THE PROTECTION FOR THIS VERY SENSITIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC OR FROM THE COMMITTEE -- A MEASURE OBERNOLTE. WELL MISTER GALLAGHER. I WOULD I MEAN JUST IN LOOKING IS A ONE THING NAY COME OCCURS TO ME AS WELL ONE THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THIS FACIAL RASH -- RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IS QUITE ON THE ANALYSIS IS MAKES A LOT OF ERRORS RIGHT I THINK IT WAS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT WERE MISIDENTIFIED -- IN IN ONE CASE -- HOWEVER I MEAN I JUST YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL WITH THE SIGN A REALLY ONLY APPLY TO LIKE A BRICK AND MORTAR. STORE SOMETHING IN OUR OFFICE YOU'RE GOING INTO IT I I JUST I WONDER IF. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GOING OUT IN PUBLIC IN YOU'RE GOING INTO A PLACE THAT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC IS YOUR IS YOUR FACE REALLY. A PRIVATE THING WHEN YOU'RE GOING IN THERE I MEAN WE HAVE CAMERAS WE HAVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AND A LOT OF CONVENIENCE STORES I MEAN. IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF A POSTING YOU KNOW AND AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT DOESN'T APPLY TO SAY. YEAH YOU GOT FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ON FACEBOOK GRAD I DON'T GO INTO A STORE BUT YOU KNOW I'VE. ACTUALLY JUST LAST WEEK I POSTED A PICTURE OF ME AND MY WIFE AND SHE WAS MISIDENTIFIED AS MY SISTER IN LAW. IN ON THÃ NH FACE. AND I HAD TO CORRECT MYSELF SO I MEAN THIS IS -- YOU KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS IS ONLY TEN POINT IN ONE AREA AND AN AREA WHERE I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF PRIVACY CONCERNS. MAYBE COULD SPEAK TO THAT YEAH I LET ME -- KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACT THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS NOT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. OF BILLS ARE AS AS FAR AS OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. ALL IN ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR IS -- TO YOU KNOW PROBABLY BUILT ON IT -- I MEAN I SOME DEFINITELY OPEN. TO LOOKING AT IT -- FROM THAT ANGLE AND I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT -- IT IS IN THE MOST. ACCURATE TECHNOLOGY ARE AND YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT THE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. BUT YEAH I THINK THIS IS THIS BILL IS A A KIND OF SMALL STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. ARE YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN PRIVACY ALL IN ALL SOUL ON BUSINESS INTERESTS FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T AT THE YOU KNOW ON ONE HAND WE DON'T WANT TO REALLY -- DO NOTHING ON THE OTHER HAND WE DON'T WANT TO OVERBURDEN THE BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY THE SMALL BUSINESSES -- YOU KNOW STILL. GIVING NOTICE MAY NOT BE THEM. MAY ONLY BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK AT LEAST GET IT STARTED -- SO ON SO THAT'S WERE WERE WE GOING WITH IT -- I'M DEFINITELY OPEN LIKE IT'S AT TO FOR THE DISCUSSION AND HOW WE CAN FIND TO THE BILL -- TO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH IT AND ALSO BE VERY EFFECTIVE. SO -- BUT THIS IS LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. THANK YOU MISTER ABILITY. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO FOLLOWING UP ON THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING. I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ARE JOB ON THIS COMMITTEE IS TO BALANCE. THE OUR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST -- OUR OBLIGATION TO PROMOTE FREEDOM AND YOUR FOUGHT TO FIND THE FULCRUM -- AND THAT BALLOTS. I'M WONDERING IN THIS CASE. WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING CONSUMERS TO DO WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL AND I WAS IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT THIS WEEKEND? AND I SAW PROP SIXTY FIVE NOTICE THAT MENTION A CHEMICAL THAT I'D NEVER HEARD OF AND I WONDERED WHAT I WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO TURN AROUND AND WALK OUT. BECAUSE THIS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER IN MIGHT BE PRESENT IN THAT RESTAURANT I DON'T THINK. THAT ANY CONSUMER WOULD ACTUALLY DO THAT AND I'M MORE I'M WONDERING THE SAME THING ABOUT THIS BILL IF IT SO IF YOUR WALK IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW AND YOU'RE WALKING INTO. A BUSINESS AND THERE'S A SIGN THAT SAYS THEY USE FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HOUSE THAT USEFUL TO ME AS A CONSUMER I THINK IT'S A IT'S A STEP ABOUT TO RAISE AWARENESS OF IN THE MINDS OF THE CONSUMER THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT -- TRYING TO CAPTURE SOMEBODY'S IMAGES AND AND I THINK IT HAS TO PROBABLY COMBINED WITH. FURTHER ACTION FOR EXAMPLE EDUCATION BEING A SECOND ONE OUGHT AND I THINK HE IS. I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A ISSUE AS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO REALLY TACKLE -- YOU KNOW IT AS WE GO FORWARD ALONG WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING TECH INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE AND AND BUSINESS OWNERS AS WELL. SO. YOU KNOW I SEE THIS AS AN ONGOING KIND OF A A PROJECT I MEAN I THINK LIKE I SAID I YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WE WANT TO TAKE AN ATTEMPT. OF TO BRING AWARENESS ON OF THIS PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY TO CONSUMERS AT A DAY WHEN THEY WALK INTO A STORE THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE BEING ON YOU KNOW THEIR IMAGES OF BEING CAPTURE. UP WITH TECHNOLOGY ARM AND YOU KNOW AND THEN PERHAPS EDUCATION WOULD BE A SECOND NOW. IN A SECOND AREA OF VEHICLE OKAY WELL IT'S JUST NOT IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THAT INFORMATION IS ANY IS IS USE WHAT ALL TO ME AS A CONSUMER. JUST THE SAME WAY THAT THAT PROP SIXTY FIVE NOTICE IN THE RESTAURANT WASN'T USEFUL TO ME BECAUSE UNLESS IT ALTERS MY BEHAVIOR. FOR PROTECTS ME IN SOME WAY THAT IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT BE THERE AND I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH MR GALLAGHER WERE. I'M NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY OVER OUR FACE IF WE CHOOSE TO LOSE OUR WE ARE FACE EXPOSED FOR IN A PUBLIC PLACE. WHERE WE LIVE IN AN ERA AND I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF IT? WHERE THERE COULD BE A DRONE A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE US THE WITH THE CAMERA AND THEN OF THAT THAT JUST THAT JUST A FACT OF LIVING IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO -- I IT'S IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TO SEE HOW THIS IS A USEFUL TOOL. WELL I THINK ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK OUT TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT -- I FIRST OF ALL ON MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSUMER IS A WHERE. ARE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN NUMBER TWO ALL PERHAPS IF THAT CONSUMER DOESN'T WANT. TO OF THE CAPTURE ODD NOTED IN A BY THESE MACHINES AND HE OR SHE COULD PROBABLY SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE. OR YOU KNOW BRING BRING THAT -- TO THE ATTENTION OF THIS TO THE STORE OWNER -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED WHETHER OR NOT WE WANTED TO OPT IN AS AS OPPOSED TO OPT OUT. SO CURRENTLY IT'S OPT OUT BASICALLY SO IF THE CONSUMERS FULLY AWARE OF THAT -- TECHNOLOGY THEN HE CAN -- TALK TO THE MANAGER I WON MY INFORMATION TO BE THE DELETED. SO THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF CONSEQUENCE OF ALL OF US SOMETHING LIKE THIS I MEAN I THINK. GIVES BRINGS AWARENESS AND THEN SECONDARILY IT TO ALSO GIVES THAT CONSUMER CHOICE OF NOT SHOPPING AT THAT PARTICULAR STORE FOR EXAMPLE. OKAY WELL MY COMFORT LEVEL BE HIGHER IF I SAW. A USEFULNESS TO IT BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANYMORE YOU STAY ON THE PROP SIXTY FIVE NOTICED IT SO -- BUT BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS OF HER. AT THE VERY MUCH A CENTER WEBER. ASSEMBLY SIDE APPRECIATE -- THE COMMENTS IN THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE HAVING HERE OF WE LIVE IN A VERY LITIGIOUS SOCIETY AND MOST OF THE SIGNS ARE DESIGNED TO PREVENT LAWSUITS TO BE VERY HONEST ABOUT IT. IF YOU WALK INTO A STORE AND THERE'S A SIGN YOU CONTINUE IN THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOON BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY WHATEVER. THAT IS IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THE SAME WAY YOU PREVENTS LAWSUIT SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT INFORMATION IT'S VERY HELPFUL FOR THOSE WHO ARE REALLY INTO IT. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT LIKE MOST OF US YOU WALK INTO THE HOSPITAL THEIR SIGNS ABOUT WHAT DO YOU BEING EXPOSED TO IN SOMEWHERE ELSE. REALLY IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT YOU FROM SUING SOMEBODY THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND SO YOU GET THE INFORMATION IF YOU GO TO RESPOND TO TO DO. IF YOU DON'T. YOU YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY BUT BASICALLY IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT ALL OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MASSIVE LAWSUITS WE HAD AND MOST SIGNS RESULT AS A RESULT OF SOME. CLASS ACTION SUIT THAT WAS TAKEN SO YOU KNOW HATE TO BE THE SENATE BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHY WE HAVE THE SO MANY SIGNS TO KEEP US FROM SUING EVERYBODY. I'M OF THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. A SECOND MISTER CHAIR WITH THE CLOTHES I LIKE TO NOTIFY EVERYONE THAT WE ARE ALL ON CAMERA RIGHT NOW SO JUST A LOT OF THIS CLOSE THAT.
