WHICH IS S. B. FOUR EIGHTY SIX FORTY FOUR BY SENATOR ARCHULETA. AND CENTER ARE TO LEAD AGAIN WE'RE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES I'LL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHATEVER YOU READY GOOD WELL A MIXTURE BEFORE BEGAN TO BE HALF THE SENATE HAD DIVERSITY SEVEN AMID BLOOM I BRING THAT MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE. HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HERE TO REPRESENT SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR REGARDED LICENSE PLUMBING CONTRACTOR REPAIR EXEMPTION UNDER CURRENT LAW PLUMBING CONTRACTORS ARE LICENSED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD AND ARE CERTIFIED TO PERFORM SURE LATERAL INSPECTION AND MAKE REPAIRS BASED ON THEIR INSPECTIONS. A HOME INSPECTION IS A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF A HOME INCLUDED BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOME PLUMBING SYSTEMS ELECTRICAL HEATING AND GENERAL MAINTENANCE PERFORMED FOR A FREE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF REAL ESTATE IN A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT PART OF A TRADITIONAL HOME INSPECTIONS SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SEWER LEAKS ARE REQUIRED BY MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES AT THE TIME OF THE HOMES SOLD. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS A HOME INSPECTOR A HOME INSPECTION COMPANY OR EMPLOYEES OF A HOME INSPECTION COMPANY FOR PERFORMING WORK ON ANY HOME WHICH THEY HAVE INSPECTED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THESE PROHIBITIONS ARE IN LAW BECAUSE HOME INSPECTORS ARE NOT LICENSE HOWEVER PLUMBER'S LICENSE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LICENSING BOARDS ARE ALLOWED TO INSPECT AND REPAIR SEWER LATERALS. CURRENTLY IT IS CONSIDERED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE FOR A PLUMBING CONTRACTOR TO DO BOTH THE SEWER INSPECTION AND THE SEWER REPAIR. IF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO- CONDUCTED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY. SB FORTY FOUR CORRECTS THIS PROBLEM ALLOWS CONSUMERS MORE CHOICES AND ALLOWS THEM TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY. SB FORTY FOUR CLARIFIES THAT A LICENSED PLUMBER AND CONTRACTOR CAN MAKE REPAIRS TO A SEWER LATERA PIPE. THEY HAVE INSPECTED EVEN IF THE A OR THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY. I IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY SEVEN CHIU. PROVIDED AN EXEMPTION FOR LICENSE REVOKED INSPECTORS SB FORTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION FOR THESE SPECIALIST LICENSED PLUMBERS. AND WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS TRENT SMITH REPRESENTING OUR BILL SPONSORED HOME GUARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TRENT SMITH ON BEHALF OF HOME GUARD AGAIN THE BILL'S IS TRYING TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT IN TWO BODIES OF LAW THE PLUMBING CODE AND THE HOME INSPECTION LAW- THERE IS- NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

AND AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE TO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NUMBERING THE CONVERSATION TO HIM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. BEGIN WITH A SUMMER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATE ARE TO LIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY HOWEVER- I THINK- JUST THE FACT THAT WE'RE BRINGING EXCEPTIONS UP. IS POSSIBLY A SIGN THAT THERE ARE SOME- ISSUES- IN CURRENT STATUTE LAW THAT NEED- NEED A DEEPER ATTENTION. FOR INSTANCE- WHAT IS THAT THAT DID THAT THE DEFINITION AND THE ROLE THE LANE IN WHICH A HOME INSPECTOR OPERATES VERSES A CONTRACTOR- POSSIBLY ONE WITH THE C. THIRTY SIX OR EVEN A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. IS THERE A DIFFERENCE AND DOES- DOES STATUTE. PUT THAT DEFINITION OUT THERE IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ROLE OF A HOME INSPECTOR WHO IS NOT LICENSED. VERSUS WHO IS INSPECTING A HOME VERSUS A CONTRACTOR WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN CALLED OUT TO DIAGNOSE A PROBLEM. AND SO- THE- YEP GO HEAD AND THEN I'LL HAVE FOR THE COMMENTS OKAY- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE AT THE ANSWER IS EXPERTISE PROFESSIONALISM AND A LICENSE THAT IS THE ANSWER REMEMBER THE HOME INSPECTOR- DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE THE CONTRACTOR THE PLUMBING CONTRACTOR DOES HAVE A LICENSE. AND THE FACT IS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE HOMEOWNER NOW THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO EITHER HIRE THAT PARTICULAR- PLUMBER FROM THAT. COMPANY OR THEY CAN GO OUTSIDE CALL WHOMEVER THEY WISH BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE COUNTY OR THE CITY WHO REQUIRES IT STILL HAS TO HAVE IT CERTIFIED BY A LICENSED PLUMBER. THERE'S THE ISSUES RIGHT THERE. I THINK IF I IF I AM MAY I THINK THE WORK THAT. IS DONE HAS TO BE DONE BASED ON A STATE LAW HAS TO BE DONE BY A LICENSED CONTRACTOR FOR INSTANCE ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES. ARE THEY A HOME INSPECTION GROUP THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS A LOT OF RUMORS LICENSE SO THAT THEY CAN. INSPECT THE HOME AND THEN TURN AROUND AND ACTUALLY DO THE WORK AS A LICENSE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WELL THAT'S WHAT THE LAW WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO THE UMBRELLA COMPANY THE HOME INSPECTION COMPANY. WILL NOW EMPLOYS LICENSE CONTRACTORS THEY CAN USE THEM- TO GO AHEAD AND DO THE WORK. AND AS STANDS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T BECAUSE IF THEY DID THE INSPECTION THEY CAN'T DO THE WORK IF THEY DID OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS SO THIS CLARIFIES IT IT IT MAKES IT MUCH BETTER FOR THE HOMEOWNER. HI MAKE AND RECEIVE- THE SERVICE THEY DESERVE SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I THINK THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL. LAW THAT DROVE- THAT DREW A LINE BETWEEN THE HOME INSPECTION AN INSPECTOR AND A CONTRACTOR NOW WE'RE HIRING CONTRACTORS TO WORK FOR THAT HOME INSPECTOR. AND SO THAT CONTRACTORS SIMPLY GONNA FOLLOW FALL FALL IN LINE WITH WHAT THAT HOME INSPECTOR SAYS RATHER THAN THERE BEING A CHECKS AND BALANCE TYPE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE SO AGAIN I'M SUPPORTING YOUR BILL- BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO. TRYING TO- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S LICENSING HOME INSPECTORS OR WHETHER IT'S MAKING UP A CLEAR DEFINITION. BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM YOU DON'T CALL HOME INSPECTOR WHEN YOU HAVE A PLUMBING PROBLEM AND YOU DON'T CALL HOME INSPECTOR YOU CALL ELECT FISHIN SO WHEN THAT ELECTRICITY COMES OUT ARE THEY INSPECTING OR THEY DIAGNOSIS. AND DO THEY REALLY NEED THIS EXEMPTION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT NEVERTHELESS I DIGRESS AND I JUST- WILL AGAIN WILL BE SUPPORTING UP BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING TO FIND CLARITY WHERE AMBIGUITY IS- IN IS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EMIGRATION AND ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLUE WHAT AT THIS BILL HAVING TO DO WITH SEWER LATERALS IS A REAL STINKER.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT SB THREE TEN. A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP SAVE SO MANY LIVES. OF CANCER PATIENTS ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. THIS BILL CREATES A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW CANCER PATIENTS TO DONATE THEIR BYING USE MEDICATIONS TO PATIENTS. WITH GREAT NEED THROUGH THEIR CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN. TRAGICALLY A RECENT STUDY SHOWS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED KNOWING OF AT LEAST ONE FRIEND. OR FAMILY MEMBER IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WHO DIED AFTER NOT RECEIVING THE MUCH NEEDED MEDICATION AND TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT. WE KNOW PATIENTS HAVE DIED THAT'S CLEAR. AND IT'S REALLY SAD TO ME THAT THESE PATIENTS HAVE PERISHED BECAUSE- NOT HAVING ENOUGH FUNDING TO PAY FOR MEDICATION AT LEAST FOURTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY SIMILAR PROGRAMS OPERATING AND WORKING AND WE NEED CALIFORNIA. TO CATCH UP MEMBERS THIS MEASURE IS A CRITICAL MEASURE THAT MAKES SENSE AND IT HELPS THE MOST. NEEDY OF PATIENCE I WILL END WITH THIS BILL. HAS UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS IS HOW IMPORTANT THIS BILL THIS TODAY WITH ME I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE TO WITNESS THIS. FIRST TO TESTIFY HERE WITH ME IN PERSON IS AT. SHF WHO IS HERE TO TELL HIS PERSONAL STORY AND ON THE PHONE I ALSO HAVE DR STEVE LEVY WHO WILL ALSO BE TESTIFYING REMOTELY IF I MAKE AND BITE HIM UP TO SPEAK. PLEASE BUT AT. IS IT IS JUST A EDGE MISTER KIT THIS IS AT YES GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A PLEASE HAVE WELCOMED THAT WITH YOUR PUP PUBLIC TESTIMONY IF YOU COULD KINDLY LIMIT YOUR TEST NINETEEN NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER READY. HEY GOOD MORNING. ON MAY THIRTEENTH OF THIS YEAR MY WIFE MAGGIE PASSED AWAY DUE TO COMPLICATIONS FROM BREAST CANCER. FINANCIALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SHE'S BEEN CANCER FREE FOR FIVE YEARS. WHEN THE DISEASE RETURNED IN THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FLOWED BEGAN BUILDING UP IN HER ABDOMINAL CAVITY A CONDITION KNOWN AS A SOCIETY'S. AND MALIGNANT BREAST CANCER CELLS WERE FOUND THAT FLUID THEREBY DEFINING HER CONDITION AS MALIGNANT ASCITES HE'S- ORDING TO THE WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY THE AVERAGE SURVIVAL TIME. FOR PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT ASIDE EASE SOME TWENTY WEEKS. HER ONCOLOGIST PUT MAGGIE ON A PROGRAM OF HORMONE SUPPRESSANTS AN ATYPICAL CHEMOTHERAPY DRUG CALLED CHEMOTHERAPY DRUG CALLED PUBLIC CICHLID MARKETED BY PFIZER. A NAME I BROWN'S. IS AN ORAL TEAM MEDICATION TAKEN AT HOME THUS AVOIDING REGULAR VISITS. TO AN INFUSION CENTER AS WELL AS THE TYPICALLY DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY. INSTEAD OF TWENTY WEEKS MAGGIE LIVED ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF YEARS. SUCH EFFECTIVENESS COMES AT A PRICE. WITHOUT INSURANCE A MONTHLY DOSE OF I BROWN'S TWENTY ONE TABLETS. WHAT'S A COUPON DISCOUNT AT THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ONE IS UNINSURED THE NOMINAL LIST PRICES CLOSER TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THE PATIENT IS INSURED AND VIBRANCE IS IN IN IN THAT INTEREST FROM FORMULAR THE MONTHLY COPAY IS OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. IMAGINE IF YOU WILL. OF SKILLED TRADES PERSON HARD WORKING SKILLED TRADES PERSON. IF THAT PERSON DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR A PROGRAM- THE FIZER RUNS QUALIFIES RUN QUALITY TOGETHER WITH N'GOLO KANTE THRESHOLD OF. LESS THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO TYPICALLY IS SKILLED TRADES PERSON MIGHT BE MAKING MORE THAN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FACED WITH A PAYMENT FOR A LIFESAVING. MEDICINE IT'S A QUOTE FROM THEIR MONTHLY MORTGAGE THAT OF COURSE IS A FINANCIAL DISASTER. IT HAPPENED THAT MAGGIE'S LAST MONTH WITH PRESCRIPTION OF IRAN'S ARRIVAL SHE WAS ALREADY IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. THE BOX IS UNOPENED SEALED BY A PATCH OF TAPE. AND WITH THE MEDICATION INSIDE SEALED IN A BLISTER PACK IT IS PRISTINE. IT IS AT PRESENT ALSO TOTALLY USELESS. SHORTLY AFTER MAGGIE DIED. I BEGAN SEARCHING FOR A WAY TO DONATE THE ON UNUSED UNOPENED MEDICINE. DURING THE SEARCH I DID NOT ENCOUNTER A SINGLE PERSON. WE DO NOT WANT TO HELP. BUT EVERY PERSON I CONTACTED HAD TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY COULD NOT HELP. THE ONLY VICE ANYWHERE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT OF DISPOSAL LOCATIONS. FOR MY PART I FIND IT ASTOUNDING INTOLERABLE THAT SOMETHING SO VERY VALUABLE SHOULD SIMPLY BE DESTROYED. THE FACT IT HAS BEEN IN THE PERSONAL POSSESSION OF ANYONE OTHER THAN A PRESCRIBING FACILITY EXCLUDES IT FROM ANY SORT OF DONATION UNDER CURRENT LAW. MAGGIE'S MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I BROWN'S BOX HAS A MAY TWENTY TWENTY TWO EXPIRATION DATE ON IT. I URGE THAT THIS MEGA MET THIS LEGISLATION BE ADVANCED WITH ALL THE SPEED THE DILIGENCE ALLOWS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMPELLING TESTIMONY. WHEN I MOVE ON TO DOCTOR LEE. HI GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS DEEPLY I'M A MEDICAL ONCOLOGIST IN OAKLAND AND I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TEN. LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND NOT AT THE REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT. MY EMPLOYER. ALLOWS ONCOLOGISTS WITHIN STRICT GUIDELINES TO TAKE BACK OUR PATIENTS ON USED-CANCER MEDICINES AND PROVIDE THEM TO PATIENTS IN NEED. A SAFE CANCER MEDICINE DONATION PROGRAM DRIVEN BY CALIFORNIA PATIENTS AND ONCOLOGISTS CAN ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE. REDUCE HEALTHCARE WASTE AND PROVIDE TIMELY TREATMENT TO UNDERSERVED PEOPLE. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WORKED IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SOME OF MY PATIENTS HAD A SPECIFIC TYPE OF STAGE FOR LUNG CANCER THAT CAN EFFICIENTLY BE TREATED WITH THE PILL. AS OPPOSED TO TALK THE CHEMOTHERAPY. HOWEVER DUE TO DELAYS RELATED TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THEY HAD UNNECESSARILY UNDER UNDERGO. ROUND OF TOXIC CHEMO TO HOLD BACK THE CANCER WHILE THE PILLS ARE BEING PROCESSED. ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE OFTEN LEFTOVER PILLS AT THE END OF THERAPY EITHER DUE TO INTOLERANCE OR INEFFECTIVENESS. THESE PILLS ARE THROWN AWAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO SYSTEM TO REPURPOSE THEM FOR MY PATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS. THIS BILL HAD SPECIFIC PATIENT PROTECTIONS BECAUSE PATIENT SAFETY IS THE FIRST OBLIGATION. WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE SAFEGUARDS ENSURE WE PROTECT PATIENTS WELL WE STRIVE TO GET THEM TIMELY ACCESS TO THE BEST TREATMENT. FINALLY A TWENTY SIXTEEN MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING STUDY FOUND THAT NEARLY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF CANCER DRUGS. WAS BEING THROWN AWAY EACH YEAR. EAST EACH WASTED MEDICATION REPRESENT AN EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA PATIENT AND A LOST OPPORTUNITY OR FOR APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY TREATMENT. OTHER STATES HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROGRAMS SINCE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND IF THAT HELPS PATIENT AND HAVE FAITH. THEIR STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK TO BRING THIS INNOVATIVE PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA ON. BEHALF OF OUR PATIENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MEDICARE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE TEN.

AND AT THIS TIME IF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE UP TO THE LINE FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN. OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SB THREE TEN. PUSH PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER. IN PLACE YOU BACK INTO THE QUEUE. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. OF SB THREE TEN. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW. AND AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN THEM IN THAT CONVERSATION BACK TEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. DR WEBER. THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO FOR THIS- MUCH MUCH NEEDED BELL AND I WE WILL DEFINITELY BE SUPPORTING IT. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- MORE ABOUT THE VISION AND KIND OF LIKE. HOW THIS WILL UNFOLD- I KNOW THAT- YOU HAD SB SIX FIFTY- WHICH- UNFORTUNATELY WITH HOLDEN APPROPRIATIONS- BECAUSE I THINK THAT CREATING. THE CANCER MEDICATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH THAT BILL WAS DOING. WOULD HAVE- INVESTIGATED AND ANSWERED MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE AS FAR AS THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY CREATING SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS DEALS WITH THE FIFTY- PARTICIPANT CAP WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT STAY NOW THAT THE- CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD IS OUT. BUT MY QUESTION IS WHAT EXACTLY IS- THE PARTICIPATING PRACTITIONR IS THAT. ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT APPLIES AND IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. OR IS THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT APPLIES. ON BEHALF OF THEIR FACILITY. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES N. THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS- YOU'LL HAVE ONE PARTICULAR PROVIDER IN A CLINIC OR A HOSPITAL THAT WILL GO TO THE TRAINING APPLY FOR WHATEVER AND THAT PERSON IS ON RECORD FOR THAT ENTIRE CLINIC OR FACILITY SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO THAT ONE. PROVIDER THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. SO ARE WE SAYING ONE OF PROVIDER OF ONE PERSON OR ONE PROVIDER IS GOOD FOR THAT SPECIFIC CLINIC OR THAT SPECIFIC HOSPITAL. HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS YES OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE FIFTY CAP CAME FROM US TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE COST. ON WHEN THE NETWORK WAS GOING TO BE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM BUT WE FOUND ANOTHER. MORE INEXPENSIVE WAY OF DOING THIS CELLS SO WE MAKE CONSIDERING MOVING THE CAP AND I TO HAPPINESS THAT HERE WITH US FOR AT TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF. IF SHE MAKE THANK YOU. CHIEF JUSTICE FOR. SHORT WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONCOLOGIST THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR WEBER- WE ARE INTENT IS TO HAVE IT BE EVERY OTHER PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BE REGISTERED- AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY SIGNED ALL THE PAPERWORK AND THE KIND OF APPRECIATE THE RULES THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT FOR HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE IF YOU HAVE. OTHER IDEAS GIVEN YOUR UNIQUE ROLE HERE AND WE'RE WELCOME HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL A LANGUAGE THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO INCLUDE BUT ARE INTENDED FOR IT TO BE EVERY PHYSICIAN- MUST BE REGISTERED. OKAY YEAH I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS THAT FURTHER BECAUSE THAT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE BIRD AND SOME- AND PHYSICIANS KIND OF COME AND GO AND SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PATIENTS AND ALL FACILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS- PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD- HAS TO DO WITH THE SELECTION CRITERIA I WASREADING- IN THE ANALYSIS. AND YOU KNOW I A I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW BUT BOTH MY BROTHER AND FATHER HAD CANCER AT THE SAME TIME MY BROTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NON HODGKINS LYMPHOMA AND THEN A MONTH LATER MY DAD MY DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH- MULTIPLE MYELOMA AND IT WAS NECESSARY VERY CRITICAL TO START TREATMENT VERY QUICKLY- FOR BOTH OF THEM AND I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WAS STATED- IN HERE FOR IN SUPPORT OF THIS PARTICULAR BELL. BUT I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE GET SELECTED- ARE WE FOCUSING ON ANYBODY IS THERE A SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER UNDERINSURED OR WITHOUT ANY INSURANCE HAVE SPECIALIZED PREFERENCE OR IS IT JUST BASED OFF OF WHO HAS THE DIAGNOSIS EVEN IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE BUT YOU MAY HAVE A DELAY IN YOUR INSURANCE- ACTUALLY AUTHORIZING THE MEDICATION IS THERE ANY KIND OF SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THIS PROGRAM. WHAT WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND THE HIGHEST NEED THAT URGENT NEED BUT I'M GONNA LET THE SAID ANSWER OUT FURTHER. THE SET. WE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES PROGRAMS TO ASSESS IF BASS SELECT. KIND OF AT A STATE LEVEL THE SELECTION CRITERION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA MANY OTHER STATES LEAVE IT TO THE SPECIFIC OFFICE- BASED ON THEIR PATIENT POPULATION AND THE NEED THAT THEY SEE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I'M I BELIEVE THE AUTHORS TAKING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR IN THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT EACH- A PROVIDER IN EACH OFFICE HAS TO CREATE. AROUND THIS PROGRAM THAT THEY MUST CREATE THEIR OWN ELIGIBILITY- AND DISTRIBUTION CRITERIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS KIND OF WELL THOUGHT OUT AND- DOCUMENTED- PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF THE PROGRAM. SO THAT WOULD SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE SELECTION CRITERIA WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THAT PARTICULAR CLINIC OR HOSPITAL. YES OKAY SO. ONE PARTICULAR CLINIC MAY CHOOSE TO- HAVE A SELECTION CRITERIA THAT WOULD REALLY SERVE THE UNDERSERVED AND SELF I AM IN THAT AREA THEN YOU KNOW AND I DON'T HAVE INSURANCE THAT I WOULD HAVE A GREATER BENEFIT FOR THAT HOSPITAL BUT ANOTHER PERSON IN ANOTHER AREA IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SELECTION CRITERIA THAN THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERSERVED WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GET THAT SAME. BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT CRITERIA BASED ON THE HOSPITAL. WELL WHAT I WILL SAY THIS- AGAIN GIVING YOUR BACKGROUND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE OPENED TODAY TO DISCUSS- INITIALLY WE REALLY FOCUS ON THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENT FIRST WE WANTED A PATIENT. PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP OR THE PHYSICIAN GETS TO DECIDE BUT LIKE I SAID THAT URGENCY FACTOR AND- AND WE'RE STILL EXPLAIN FURTHER IF YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO MEET THE BILL TO TRY AND REMOVE THE CAP OF FIFTY TO INCLUDE TO REMOVE THE MET PORTS SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT. YOU WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH ME ABOUT WE CAN DEFINITELY TO YOUR THOUGHTS IN THIS WE WANT THIS TO BE EFFECTIVE WE WANT THIS TO SAVE LIVES AND WE WANTED TO DO IT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE MANNER- AGAIN I KNOW THERE'S A REAL HUMAN FACTOR TO THIS SAYS YOU KNOW MIGHT WITNESS STATED. YOU KNOW WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER FAMILIES HOLDING ON TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MEDICATION SO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SAID JASSIM RAINFOREST WERE STILL MANY IN THE BILL WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND INCLUDE WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE. TO MEET YOUR CONCERNS. WHAT YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU MY OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO CONTACT YOUR OFFICE ON BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK.

SB TWO FORTY ONE BY SENATOR UMBERG. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I PLEASE PRESENT SB TWO FORTY ONE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA COURT EFFICIENCY ACT IT HAS TO PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST IS. TAKING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC WITH RESPECT TO COURT EFFICIENCY IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT IF TWO PARTIES STIPULATE THAT A WITNESS MAY APPEAR REMOTELY THAT WITNESS MAY THEN APPEAR VIRTUALLY IF THE COURT HAS THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO PERMIT THAT- IF THEY ON'T STIPULATE AND ONE PARTY MOVES. IN THE COURT FOUR BECAUSE A LAWS OF TO SPEND TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY- THEY CAN DO SO- THERE ARE MANY CRITERIA THOUGH THAT GO INTO THE EVALUATION AS TO WHETHER WITNESS CAN APPEAR REMOTELY- THIS SAVES. TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY BOTH FOR LITIGANTS AS WELL AS THE PARTIES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS WHO WOULD BE REALLY A MINISTERIAL WITNESS MAY NOT ACTUALLY SHOW UP AND WAIT TO TESTIFY. THEY COULD DO SO FROM THEIR OFFICE IN THE SAME THING GOES WITH RESPECT TO PRO SE LITIGANTS A RATHER THAN COMING TO COURT PARTICULARLY FOR. A PRO FORMA HEARINGS THEY CAN DO SO EITHER ELECTRONICALLY FROM THEIR HOME OR THEY CAN GO TO FOR EXAMPLE LEGAL AID AND CONNECT THROUGH LEGAL AID THAT'S PART ONE OF THE BILL PART TWO OF THE BILL- SIMPLY ALLOWS- CLEARS UP BASICALLY. WHAT OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTERS CAN DO. IN TERMS OF TRANSCRIBING DEPOSITIONS IT'LL BE USED IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDES THAT THEY'LL BE A LOCAL COURT REPORTING FIRM THEY'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUT OF STATE COURT REPORTING FIRM IT'S ANALOGOUS TO LOCAL ATTORNEYS BEING ASSOCIATED IN A CASE WHERE YOU'RE OUT OF STATE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE HANDLING PRIMARY PRINCIPAL SPONSOR ABILITIES. ARJAN I VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER AMBER WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I SEE THAT THERE ARE TWO IF YOU COULD KINDLY LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES EACH. WILL BEGIN WITH THE FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AND HE SAID THAT THAT WE HAVE THE CHAIR FROM THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD. MORNING I'M ROBIN SON SHE'S CHAIR OF THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD THANK YOU SHARE LOW ONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT AN- UNCOMPLICATED. WELL THAT IT FISCALLY SMART SOLUTION IN SB TWO FORTY ONE. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS OF COURT REPORTING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED WHETHER THEY SECURE THOSE SERVICES THROUGH A FIRM OWNED BY LICENSEE. OR CORPORATION KNOCKED DOWN BY A LICENSEE. IT ISN'T THAT SIMPLE THIS IS ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION. THE COURT REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT IS AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE TRIAL. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURES LEGISLATORS HAVE PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED LAWS TO INCLUDE DETAILS. AND SPECIFICITY ON EXACTLY HOW THE RECORD SHOULD BE HANDLED TO UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY OF COURT REPORTING IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WE ARE HERE BEFORE YOU BECAUSE THE BOARD'S ABILITY TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY NOT BEING ABLE TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS WITH FIRMS OWNED BY A NON LICENSING. COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY THE BOARD INCLUDING BILLING IRREGULARITIES AND TRANSCRIPT MISCONDUCT IN ALLOWING ONE SIDE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A TRANSCRIPT BEFORE THE OTHER. HEREBY GIVING THEM AN ADVANTAGE OF PREPARING FOR LITIGATION. THE BORDERS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT ARM AT THE BOARD FOR THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION TO pREPORTING SERVICES. TO THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE NO MATTER WHERE THEIR HOME TATE IS LOCATED. SB TWO FORTY ONE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO KNOW THEY HAVE SOMEONE TO TURN TO. NAMELY THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD SHOULD THEY EXPERIENCE AN ETHICAL ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR BY A COURT REPORTER. OR A COURT REPORTING FIRM. THE BOARD WELCOMES DIVERSE BUSINESSES BECAUSE COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER. ITS FIRST HEALTHY BUSINESS RAISES THE QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE LOWERS PRICES AND EXPAND. ACCESS TO GOODS AND SERVICES WHAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE CAN IS TO HAVE THE UNABLE TO SEE IN FOR THE LAW. THAT WERE GIVEN IT TO YOU GIVEN TO IT BY THE LEGISLATURE. WE THANK SENATOR- BURKE AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US. ON AMENDMENTS TO THE REPORTING PORTION OF THE BILL. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT SB TWO FORTY ONE FOR EQUAL PROTECTION OF ALL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THANK YOU.

EVEN IF THE LINE HAUL OF THE COURT TO WAITING A DAY OR TAKING AN ENTIRE DAY OFF OF WORK. ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT PRIMARY WITNESS IN THE CASE.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LED THE SANTOS ON BEHALF OF AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER DEPLOYED BY THE COURTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY ONE POINT THAT WAS MADE BY THE PROPONENTS WITNESS THAT THIS BILL IS LIMITED. TO WITNESS APPEARANCES THAT ARE NON PRIMARY THERE IS NO. LIMITATION THAT SPELL ALL WITNESSES INCLUDING EVIDENTIARY AND TESTIMONIAL WITNESSES COULD APPEAR. REMOTELY PURSUANT TO THIS MEASURE. REPORTER ATTACK WITH PUTTING THE FAIR OF OFFICIAL VERBATIM IN CORPUS. THIS IS AN ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT DURING THE PANDEMIC THE COURT REPORTERS HAVE BEEN FACED WITH THE SAME TECHNOLOGICAL AN OPERATOR IN OUR PROBLEMS WE'VE ALL SEEN THIS YEAR FROM DROPPED LINES TO WAR BLIER UNDEFINABLE SPEAKERS. TO SPEAKERS NOT KNOWING HOW TO MUTE OR UNMUTE THEMSELVES THE COURT REPORTERS THEMSELVES BEING MUTED AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO ALERT THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO AN UNVIABLE TRANSCRIPT. THIS HADN'T EVEN BEEN THE WORST OF IT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED ATTEMPTED WITNESS TAMPERING INCLUDING MINOR CHILDREN JUDGES ADVISING THEM TO JUST PUT IN AUDIBLE OR UNINTELLIGIBLE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NO SUCH AUTHORITY UNDER THEIR LICENSES FOR THE HEARTBREAK OF A DESPERATELY POOR PARENTS. HAVING THEIR MINUTES RUN OUT ON THE PHONE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR TESTIMONY DURING A CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDING. UNLIKE ALL OF WHOM SUCH TECHNOLOGICAL OR OPERATOR ERROR PROBLEMS MIGHT NEARLY BE OUR COME MY COURT REPORTERS LICENSES ONLINE AND THAT'S NOT JUST HYPOTHETICAL THERE ARE CURRENTLY FILINGS BEFORE THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD. ALLEGING PROBLEMS WITH TRANSCRIPT ONE NO SUCH. PROBLEMS OCCURRED. THIS ISN'T THE ABOUT MY CORPORATE. IT IS ABOUT LEADING ARE THE PUT OF THE MEASURE MAY I KNOWING BE A- TO DIFFERENT. THEMSELVES ON THE ALL THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIRE UNDER THIS BILL THAT BOTH PARTIES THE RAPPER. OR EVEN A- OF THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF A GREEN HAVE A WITNESS APPEAR REMOTELY WE'RE TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS ARISE. THE LACK OF PROTECTIONS UNDER THE SPELL MAKE THE BILL'S REQUIREMENT THAT BOTH PARTIES AGREE ALL BUT OBLIGATORY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT UNDER THIS BILL THAN THE FEDERAL COURT REPORTER EMPLOYED BY THE COURT. BE PRESENT DURING THE PROCEEDINGS WERE WITNESSES APPEAR REMOTELY EVEN THE COURT REPORTERS MUST BE PROVIDED TO INDIGENT LITIGANTS PERCENTAGE ANISE AND DEDUCT THAT GIVEN THE DRAMATIC DISPARITY BETWEEN REPRESENTED AND UNREPRESENTED PARTIES AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCEEDINGS.

IN THE ABILITY OF THE COURT REPORTER TO SHARE THE TESTIMONY. AND CELEBRATION CAPTAIN THROWN OUT AND START ALL OVER AGAIN AND THIS. TYPE OF PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN HEARING IT REPEATEDLY. FROM OUR COURT REPORTERS IN MOST COUNTIES IN THE STATE IS JUST MOVING TOO QUICKLY TOO SOON WITHOUT PROPER ASSESSMENT.

IN OUR EXPERTISE HAS RESULTED IN UP AGAIN A FIND THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL. IF YOU LIVE ON STATUTES THAT WERE CRAFTED SPECIFICALLY FOR LICENSING.

WHEN I MOVE THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MET MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEGIN WITH MISTER GIPSON FILED BY MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. OF I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OFF OF THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- BUT I JUST HAVE CONCERNS- I THINK THIS BILL IS. IS A DOUBLE I DON'T OF THE BILL OF OVER FOR- LET ME JUST OFF BY SIMPLY SAY- THIS PANDEMIC IS CERTAINLY HAS. HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF ISSUES- THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING TO REYES SPECIALLY HEALTH DISPARITIES OF PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO. HEALTH CARE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR ME WHO REPRESENT THE SIX BOARDS THERE'S A GOOD STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REALIZING THAT KIDS DOING DISTANCE LEARNING I HAD KIDS IN MY IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET SERVICES- BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND SAID A BLOCK WALLS THAT SIGNAL CANNOT PENETRATE. AND I'M I'M GOING SOMEWHERE WITH THIS- AND LOOKING AT BROADBAND SERVICES AND I KNOW INTO LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PEPLE WHO ARE ALREADY SPOKE. ONE PERSON SAID- SOMEONE TO TURN TO WELL I'M GONNA USE THAT PHRASE IN MY IN MY COMMENTS. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ONE TO TURN TO. IN MY COMMUNITY AND ALL OVER THE CALIFORNIA TERMS ACCESS TO KEEP ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT. TRY TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR JUSTICE IN THE COURT ROOM WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BARRIERS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE THERE IF THEY IF THEY HAVE INTERNET ACCESS THE AT HOME. THEY THEY HAVE AT THE TO AT HOME THEY HAVE NO ONE TO TRY TO LEAST COACH THEM POLICE TELL THEM WHAT TO SAY OR HAVING LANGUAGE OR MATERIALS THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND TO BE TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND THEY'RE ON ON TV OR INTERNET AND TRYING TO GET THAT COMMUNICATION THAT DIALOGUE WHICH IS A VERY- FOR THEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ACCESS. WHO HAVE NO INTERNET ACCESS TO BROADBAND SERVICES AND YOU STILL LOOKING AT A CERTAINLY A BERRIER WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THAT- AND- IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW- IS COMPLICATED. AND WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO STAND BEFORE WHERE THE WITNESSES OR OR OR TESTIFYING WHATEVER- IT IS JUST IS NOT SUPPORTED LESS THEY ACTUALLY IN A COURT ROOM AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT ABILITY- TO HAVE THAT KIND OF LEVEL. PLAYING GIVEN TO UP AND IT TO THAT. HAVING UMBILICAL KIND OF WAY N TERMS OF. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A STATE THIS VERY ROBUST WE HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL HERE BUT I'M HEARING THAT WE- DEAL WITH PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW I CANNOT FEED MY NEIGHBOR'S KIDS INVOLVED KIDS GOING HUNGRY WITH THAT SIMPLY MEAN IS. THAT CALIFORNIA'S COME FIRST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS WORK AND WE SHOULD NOT BE RELYING ON OUT OF STATE- PEOPLE TO DO THE KIND OF WORK THAT CALIFORNIA'S CAN STAND UP. AND CERTAINLY DO IN A VERY QUALIFIED MATTER SO I WOULD. JUST ASK THE- AUTHOR ONE- ARE THEY AMENDMENTS THAT'S GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO COME TO A MEDIUM- A MEDIUM GROUND SO THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH AND PASSES BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS COME BEFORE OUR HOUSE AND- AND ACTUALLY BE VOTED. OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SO TO- IF IN FACT DO YOU THINK THAT- SOME OF THE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT YOU CAN ADDRESS AROUND BROADBAND AND THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET ACCESS- BECAUSE AT THIS POINT ABOUT THE LAY OFF OF THIS MY FIRST TIME ACTUALLY LAYING OFF OF. OF THE BILL- AND LOOKING AT AMENDMENT SO IF THE- KIND SENATOR CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE I'LL BE HAPPY TO. LISTEN THANK YOU SENATOR PER JUST BEFOREHAND JUST ON TO. DRINK THE MEMBER FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS AND JUST TO REAFFIRM THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE THE BILL BEFORE US RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO STAY IN OUR LANE WITH RESPECT TO. BEING P. AS THIS IS DOUBLE EFFORT AS WELL TO JUDICIARY SO IT AGAIN AS WE HAVE THE BILL BEFORE US WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO STAY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE VISIT OF PROFESSIONS CODE SPECIFICALLY NONETHELESS THAT IS A- VALID OKAY- ISSUE THAT YOU'VE ALSO ADDRESSED MISTER GIBSON SO SENATOR AMBER DO YOU WISH TO ADDRESS. SETTING GIPSON QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- ON SEVERAL LEVELS FIRST OF ALL. CONCERNING COURT REPORTERS COURT REPORTERS. PROVIDE A VERY VERY VALUABLE FUNCTION IN- AND- MY OWN PER TRIAL PRACTICE THEY'VE BEEN HELPFUL TELLING ME WHEN I'M- NOT BEING CLEAR TELLING ME WHEN I'M GARGLING MY WORDS. SO THAT THE RECORD IS ACCURATE UP THIS BILL AND WE CAN MAKE IT EVEN MORE SPECIFIC. DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT A COURT REPORTER BE IN THE COURTROOM WHENEVER TESTIMONY IS BEING AKEN. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO CONTACT THE JUDGES YOU KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT THE CONTACT FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY IS THAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR DISTRICT. BECAUSE WITH RESPECT TO SOMEONE WHO IS INDIGENT. LET'S JUST LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION. AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION IF YOU ARE BEING- POTENTIALLY EVICTED AND FOR EXAMPLE- YOU OR- YOUR OPPONENT WISHES TO HAVE A CONTINUANCE YOU CAN GO TO COURT THERE IS NOTHING HERE THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM GOING TO THE COURTHOUSE. WHAT IT DOES DO THOUGH IS FOR A HEARING THAT WILL PROBABLY LAST LESS THAN THREE MINUTES YOU CAN DO SO FROM YOUR HOME IF YOU HAVE CONNECTIVITY OR FROM A LIBRARY IF YOU HAVE CONNECTIVE ITTY. OR FROM LEGAL AID OFFICE. OR YOU CAN WAIT FOR A DAY AND GO TO COURT MISS A DAY OF WORK. AND DO THAT. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT IT SIMPLY CREATES EFFICIENCIES AND IT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO MISS A DAY OF WORK TO THOSE WHO CAN'T MISS A DAY WORK SO THAT THEY CAN PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. IT ALSO CUTS DOWN IF YOU ARE A LITIGANT IF YOU ARE A LITIGANT AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT NEEDS TO IDENTIFY RECORDS YOU CAN EITHER. HAVE THEM COME IN HANG AROUND FOR A DAY OR YOU CAN HAVE THEM TESTIFY REMOTELY. IT'S VERY SIMPLE WE HAVE BEEN DOING REMOTE TESTIMONY COURT CALL FOR THIRTY YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I REALIZE THAT THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT TECHNOLOGY ENCROACHING ON COURT REPORTERS RESPONSIBILITIES. OUT WE WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT A COURT REPORTER HAS TO BE IN THE COURTROOM. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN COURT PROCEEDINGS YOU KNOW COURT REPORTER SIMPLY RAISES HIS OR HER HAND. AND THE JUDGE WAS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECORD STOPS THE PROCEEDINGS AND SAYS TO THE WITNESS I'M SORRY YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO REPEAT YOUR ANSWER FOR YOU CAN'T SPEAK ON TOP ONE OF. THE SAME IS TRUE IN A REMOTE HEARING COURT REPORTER COULD DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING SO I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT THIS ISSUE IS ONE THAT- WILL CERTAINLY BE ADDRESSED. IN CLEAR FORM OF ITS NOT CLEAR NOW CONSIDER A COURT REPORTER BEING PRESENT COURTROOM. ASSEMBLY GIPSON DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL FALTER OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SUMMER CUNNINGHAM. YEAH I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL AND ADD JUST SOME PERSPECTIVE- THAT I HAVE FROM BEING A PRACTITIONER IN A COUNTY OF. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE PRIMARILY- OUR COURTS ARE SO IMPACTED RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE A SAYING IN THE LAW JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED AND IT AFFECTS EVERY SINGLE. FACET OF THE COURT SYSTEM FAMILY LAW CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS CIVIL PROCEEDINGS UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS GOING DOWN THE LIST. IN MY COUNTY RIGHT NOW I FILED THE A PETITION TO FOR DISMISSAL OF THE CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR FORMER CLIENT. MISDEMEANOR D. Y. IT WAS FINAL PROBATION SERVICE PROBATION TERM NO PROBLEMS THE STATUTE ITSELF SAYS IT IS TO BE GRANTED AS A MATTER OF RIGHT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. MY COURTS BEEN SITTING ON THAT FOR NINETY DAYS. NINETY DAYS THIS PARTICULAR CLIENT IS TRYING HE'S HE'S IN INDIA HE'S A PERMANENT RESIDENT. WANTS TO GO BACK AND SEE HIS FAMILY IN INDIA WHERE HIS PARENTS LIVE AND HE CAN'T GET ON A PLANE UNTIL THIS IS DONE. AND I'M THE FREAKING ELECTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO PRACTICES IN THIS. IT'S SO IMPACTED RIGHT NOW. I THINK. WHAT THE CENTER IS TRYING TO DO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS ABOUT EFFICIENCY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE ELECTRONICALLY VIA ZOOM OUR COURTS HAVE MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET THAT THE SYSTEM SET UP AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S WORKED WHAT HASN'T WORKED. A BUT UNLESS WE TAKE SOME STEPS TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY IN THE SYSTEM. YEAH THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE OF THAT IMPACT IT'S THE PETITIONS FOR EXPUNGING CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE GETTING HURT IT'S THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS ARE GETTING HURT IT'S I MEAN YOU NAME IT AT THIS POINT IN TIME RIGHT NOW AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY OR THE TWO COUNTIES I PRACTICE IN. THE ONLY TRIAL YOU CAN EVEN GET ON A CALENDAR. IS A CRIMINAL TRIAL WITHOUT A TIME WITH. ANYTHING ELSE YOU'RE BEING PUT OUT. MONTHS IF NOT YEARS. WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE WANT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AND SETTLE ISSUES AND WE'VE GOT TO DO IT EFFICIENTLY. AND IF WE DON'T. THE INJUSTICE FALLS HARDEST ON THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE LEAST ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. BY HIRING EXPENSIVE LAWYERS TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK FOR THEM. IF THEY CAN EVEN MAKE THEM WORK. IF THEY CAN EVEN MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK. SO I JUST WANT TO OFFER THAT PERSPECTIVE THE IMPACT ON OUR COURT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS REAL. THE DELAY. THAT EVERYBODY'S FACING ISRAEL. AND I'VE I THINK THIS MEASURE WILL WILL DO SOMETHING TO HELP ALLEVIATE THAT AND MOVE TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFICIENCY. AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE WITH THE COURT REPORTER I THINK WE'VE HEARD IS COMMITMENT. TO WORKING THAT OUT OVER TIME AND I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE. AND YES THE SAME PROCESS CAN BE. EMPLOYED AND HIM. HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. NOBODY IS BEING FORCED TO DO ELECTRONIC THINGS YOU CAN STILL ORDER THIS BILL IF NOT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. YOU CAN STILL COME INTO COURT. IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE TO DOWNTOWN LA FROM HER YOU HAVE FOR WHEREVER YOUR- YOUR THINGS VENUE DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT OPTION SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. I HOPE IT PASSES BECAUSE WE. WE DEFINITELY NEED SOME HELP IN THE COURT SYSTEM. THANK VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA FOLLOWED BY SOME IMMIGRATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I REPRESENT RIVERSIDE SO VERY AWARE. OF THE- CLOGGING OF OUR COURTS. ABOUT IT BUT I THINK- ONE ISSUE ON THAT WOULD BE- MORE JUDGES. ESPECIALLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT I HEARD. FROM ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM LA HERE. ON I'LL JUST THE INEFFICIENCY. OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT WE'VE SEEN IT HERE. OF FIRST HAND ON THIS FLOOR- IN IN OUR HEARINGS WERE. THINGS GO OUT- AS AN EDUCATOR. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT HAD BEEN FOR STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS A TO DO DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE FAILURE. OF THE TECHNOLOGY SO WHEN I HEARD COURT REPORTERS SAYING. THE DAY FACED THOSE SAME CHALLENGES- I'M SYMPATHETIC AND JUST WONDERING IF THE SENATOR JUST MIGHT. WANT TO ADDRESS AGAIN- YOUR RESPONSE TO THE COURT REPORTERS WHO SAY THAT THAT IT'S A FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT MAKES THEIR JOB IS COURT REPORTERS- ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO I KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. SURE THROUGH THE CHAIR. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LET ME LET ME CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS. IT TECHNOLOGY FAILS THE JUDGE IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE COURTROOM AND ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSCRIPT TO LAWYERS. TWO OR MORE LAWYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO REPRESENT THEIR INDIVIDUAL PARTIES AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS NOT AN ACCURATE RECORD THEY HAVE A- INTEREST IN MAKING SURE IT'S ACCURATE IF TECHNOLOGY FAILS. WHEN IT FAILS OCCASIONALLY THEN THEY STOP AND THEY SAY OKAY EVERYBODY'S GOT TO COME IN IF THAT'S THE CASE WELL WE'VE GOT TO WAIT TILL IT GETS FIXED. TO SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK IN TIME TO A TIME LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO. LITERALLY A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO WHERE EVERYONE HAS TO BE IN COURT INCLUDING THE CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS INCLUDING MINISTER WITNESSES INCLUDING EVERYBODY WHO HAS. A TWO MINUTE APPEARANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE GOING BACK TO UNLAWFUL DETAINERS. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO. EVEN IF WE HAVE MORE JUDGES WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE. THE CRISIS THAT ALREADY EXISTS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SAFEGUARDS TO LAWYERS HAVE TO STIPULATE BY THE WAY. TO THE PARENTS OF A WITNESS IF THEY DON'T STIPULATE AND ONE BELIEVES THAT SOMEHOW THAT WITNESSES SIMPLY MINISTERIAL THEY CAN MAKE A MOTION THE JUDGE BUT THE JUDGE HAS A NUMBER OF CRITERIA TO GO THROUGH. AND IF THE JUDGE IS WRONG THEN THERE'S AN ISSUE ON APPEAL. THERE ARE A NUMBER PROTECTIONS HERE- I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT ENCROACH UPON COURT RISK RECORDABLE RESPONSIBILITIES OUR PRESENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SIMILAR GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO WANNA LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES- BOTH FROM THE BACKLOGS IN THE COURTS- TO THE CONCERNS OF THE COURT REPORTERS. AND BASED ON THE PER VIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- BUT I DO KNOW- BEING REFERRED TO- ANOTHER COMMITTEE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF IT AND IT MAY BE THAT TECHNOLOGY FAILS BUT IT ONLY FAILS ON ONE PARTY'S PART AND SO IT'S MAYBE NOT KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE PARTY- WHO HAPPENS TO BE ON THAT CALL OUR- WORD DEPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY TO GET- THE TESTIMONY THROUGH.
