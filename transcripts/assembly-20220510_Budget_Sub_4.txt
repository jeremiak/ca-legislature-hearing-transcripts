I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS NICK THOMAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMICS A NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THEREFORE THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES- FLEXIBILITY TO THOSE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY BY ALLOWING THEM TO DELAY THEIR TAX PAYMENTS AND NOT INCUR INTEREST OR PENALTIES RELATED TO LATE FILING AND PAYMENT. IT WOULD BE OPERABLE FOR TAX YEARS TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BECAUSE PAYMENT DUE DATES RELATED TO THOSE YEARS WERE AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. I'M SPECIFICALLY SINGLE TAXPAYERS EARNING LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND MARRIED FILING JOINTLY HOUSEHOLDS. EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD HAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH I TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO PAY THEIR TAXES. ARE FOR THOSE TAXES. INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED- WOULD BEGIN TO ACCRUE A NEW AS OF OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ON ANY UNPAID BALANCE LASTLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE AN ELIGIBLE TAXPAYER HAS ALREADY MADE A LATE PAYMENT. I'M OR THOSE ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS AND PAID A LATE PAYMENT ON. A LATE PENALTY OR INTEREST- THE FTV WILL AUTOMATICALLY REFUND. OF THE PENALTY AND INTEREST PAYMENTS. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LOL HAVE NO ISSUES ON THE TRAILER BILL. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS THIS A COUPLE ON ON MY END- THIS PROGRAM BENEFITS THE GOOD ACTORS IN THE BACK ACTORS AS THEIR- GENUINELY. IMPACTED BY COAL BETTER THOSE WHO FAIL TO PAY. THEIR TAXES ON TIME. THE- OF THE PROPOSAL SETS LIMITS FOR BASED ON ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME AND THAT WAS BASED ON TARGETING THOSE TAXPAYERS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE CLOSER TO THE MIKE PLACE. THAT WAS- TO A FAST START OVER I'M SO THE PROPOSAL SETS. LIMITS ON ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME I'M BASED ON TAXPAYERS THAT WE KNOW WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. I AM AND THAT'S IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS AS STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE AND AS TAXPAYER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE. YES HI. I DIDN'T HAVE MY GYNECOLOGIST DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY. FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT ONE MILLION I CANNOT TO BE ELIGIBLE IN EACH TAX YEAR. THERE WOULD BE SOME OVERLAP- FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOLLOW UP IT WAS THERE A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK DURING THE CODED. AS TWO YEARS VERSES THAT THREE YEARS. THE THREE TAX YEARS PRECEDING IT. OUT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF AN UPTICK BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. DATA IS PARTICULARLY EASY TO COME BY. THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON THANK YOU GENTLEMEN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. THESE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF MAKE SURE MICROPHONES ON THANK YOU. BRIAN RUTLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF- I GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT I'M FORMER FINANCE I ALMOST SAID FINANCE. MY APOLOGIES OF THIS IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT WHERE THERE'S AN EXISTING POSITION IN GOVERNMENT CODE FOR THE STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION WE'RE JUST MAKING CLARIFYING CHANGES HERE TO ALIGN WHAT THE ROLE CURRENTLY IS DOING AND TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND STATUTES. WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WEBER BARBARA FINE IT'S NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES ON THE LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY ON THE DIRECTOR ALTHOUGH WE DO WE JUST REITERATED CONCERN YOU RAISED PREVIOUSLY ON THE BROADER PROPOSAL WITHIN GOBIZ. IF YOU PUT CREATE A KIND OF IMMIGRANT FOCUSED POSITION WITHIN GO VISIBLE COORDINATE WITH THE DIRECTOR- WE REMAIN UNCLEAR ON WHAT NEW SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT POSITION WOULD BE UNDERTAKING THAT ARE NOT ALREADY. COVERED BY THE DEPARTMENTS MANY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AND SO WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOME OF THAT DETAIL IN THIS IN THIS TRAILER BILL OR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND- THAT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO US. THANK YOU FOR THAT. CHECK CHECK THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK- I HAVE VERY SIMILAR QUESTIONS AND WONDERING IF YOU CAN PLEASE EXPAND. WHAT IT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A DIRECTOR'S ROLE MOVING FORWARD AND WHY SPECIFICALLY UNDERGO THIS. SO I ALL JUST A BACK UP FOR ONE SECOND BECAUSE I THINK IT'LL HELP CLARIFY THAT. GOBIZ CURRENTLY HAS A TWO PROPOSALS RELATED TO IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION WE HAVE THIS TRAILER BILL HERE. AND THERE'S AN EXISTING POSITION BASED ON STATUTE THAT'S WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SO THIS STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF AN IMMIGRANT IMMIGRATION- WHAT ARE IMMIGRATION INTEGRATION APOLOGIES. WOULD NOT MOVE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO THE ROLE WOULD STAY THERE. ARE THERE'S A SECOND PROPOSAL THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ALLEY- IS. IS MENTIONING WERE PROPOSING- SOME FUNDING FOR A GRANT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS WITH THE- WITH SUPPORT TO DEVELOP IMMIGRANT SUPPORT SERVICES AND SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A FORTHCOMING WITH MAY REVISE WHAT WE'LL SEE MORE DETAILS THERE. ARE THAT INCLUDED AS PART OF THAT PROPOSAL A NEW POSITION AGO BUSINESS I THINK THERE IS SOME CONFUSION. OTHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE JUST TO CLARIFY IS AN EXISTING POSITION AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHEREAS THE GRANT PROPOSAL COMES WITHOUT A POSITION AT GOMEZ. CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A ONE POSITION WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WHERE IS THE YES- CURRENTLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS HOME TO THE STATE WIDE IT'S IN STATUTE THE TITLE IS STATEWIDE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE TITLE OR THE LOCATION WE'RE JUST CLARIFYING THE ROLE. THE ROLE WILL ESSENTIALLY BE BROADLY THE SAME WE'RE JUST ARE SIGNALING FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOCIAL INCLUSION AND ECONOMIC INCLUSION IS GONNA BE. A FOCUS THAT'S ALREADY A FOCUS OF THE DIRECTOR'S ROLE BUT THE STATUTORY CHANGES JUST HELP CLARIFY THAT. THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR THANK YOU. SWITCHES ONE MOMENT. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH ISSUE NUMBER THREE AGAIN THANK YOU GERMAN TO THE LAST PANEL THIS IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ATTAINABILITY FUND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. IS BEGIN. I'M GONNA NAIL THIS TIME BRIAN RUTLEDGE BUDGET OFFICER GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU FOR LETTING US UPDATE YOU ON THE TRAILER BILL FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET SUSTAINABILITY FUND. JUST STEP BACK RESTATE OUR GOAL HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN HIGH POVERTY AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AREAS. TO TRANSITION TO A MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA'S TRANSITION WHERE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS A CARBON NEUTRAL. ECONOMY IS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES ACROSS THE STATE. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY IDENTIFY SOME CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT REVENUE CAPACITY TO DO A SPECIFIC PROJECTS THESE FUNDS WOULD HELP THEM. DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY AND HELP CREATE MULTIPLIER EFFECTS- THAT WOULD BE. VERY BENEFICIAL NOT JUST TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY BUT TO THE STATE. THE OVERALL BIG PICTURE IS THIS HELPS US MOVE TOWARDS. CARBON NEUTRAL I ECONOMY WHICH- I OVER TIME IF WE DO THIS SO. WE'RE A. WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT YOU CAN- WE LOOK FOR TO GETTING YOUR INPUT QUESTIONS. AS PART OF FINANCE. AND WEBER TERMINA FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. WELL THAT'S WHEN THIS ITEM IS HEARD BEFORE WE RAISED A FEW ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSAL- FIRST WAS HOW IT WOULD RELATE TO A RECENTLY ENACTED AND STILL BEING DEVELOPED- RELATED INITIATIVES THAT WOULD PROMOTE LOCAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION- AND WE ALSO NOTED THAT- THE PROPOSAL THE PARAMETERS ON THE PROGRAM MORE QUITE BROAD AND VAGUE AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT OBJECTIVES AND WHAT THEY WOULD BE GETTING FROM ALLOCATING FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAMME. OF THE TRAILER BILL IS PUT SOME ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS ON THE PROGRAM BUT IN OUR VIEW THE LANGUAGE IS STILL A VERY BROAD- IT STILL PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DISCRETIN TO GOBIZ TO THAT THE CRITERIA FOR THE GRANTS- DETERMINE WHO WOULD GET THEM WHAT THEY WOULD BEFORE- AND SO GIVEN THOSE FACTORS AND THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T ALLOCATE FUNDING INTEL TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR DOESN'T ALLOCATE ANY MONEY IN THE BUDGET YEAR ARE WE THINK IT COULD BE WARRANTED FOR OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DELAY ANY KIND OF APPROVAL ON THIS PROGRAM AS THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK WITH. MORE OF CONCRETE OBJECTIVES AND PROJECTS HERE THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE CLEAR ON WHAT THEY WOULD BE GETTING FOR FUNDING FOR THIS INITIATIVE. THANK YOU SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THAT'S CORRECT TO THE REQUEST IS FOR ONE MILLION OR ONE HUNDRED MILLION BEGINNING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR ONE TIME ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND THEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. BUT THE PROPOSAL HERE FOR THE TRAILER BILL IS TO ENACT THIS- AS WRITTEN TO GET THE PROGRAM ON THE BOOKS HERE. AND WHAT FEEDBACK HAS THE ADMINISTRATION RECEIVED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR OR THE FUNDS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS WRITTEN THE TRAILER BILL WOULD MAKE TEN COUNTIES ELIGIBLE. AND OF THOSE TEN WE'VE SPOKEN AT THIS POINT TO ABOUT FOUR FIVE. ONE OF THE BIG REQUESTS FROM COUNTIES HAS BEEN TO MAKE A TO MAKE THIS A DIRECT REVENUE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. THAT IS NOT A THE INTENT HERE- WE'RE WE ARE TRYING TO HELP MOVE TOWARDS A BIGGER. A BIGGER PICTURE VISION WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOSING X. Y. Z. DOLLARS ON SOME EXISTING SERVICE AND WE'RE GONNA BACK FILL YOU. IN FACT THIS IS DESIGNED TO HELP OUR MOVE TOWARDS PLANNING FOR ABOUT TRANSITION WHERE YOU HAVE A MORE DIVERSE ECONOMY. YOU HAVE A MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY AND SO THIS IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE- THE DIRECT REVENUE REPLACEMENT HOWEVER. IT VERY MUCH RESPONSE TO IF YOU ARE MAXED OUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE REVENUE TO PURSUE A PROJECT. THAT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL THAT MIGHT PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY OR DIVERSIFYING YOUR LOCAL INDUSTRIES THIS IS WHERE THIS WOULD COME IN SO IT IS- WE'RE TRYING TO RESPOND TO. SOME REVENUE LIMITS THAT LOCALS MIGHT HAVE. WHAT IS THE FIRM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DIVERSIFY A LOCAL INITIATIVE. WHAT WOULD BE THE- I GUESS THE IMPACT OR ACCOUNTABILITY OF SUCCESS ON WHICH PROJECTS GET SELECTED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO AS BILL WITH PROPOSED IT DOES SAY THAT GO BIZ CAN DETERMINE THE CRITERIA. WE'VE TRIED TO FILTER IT OUT AT A AT A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL AND LEAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY HERE. I'LL SAY THAT THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE'RE TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE AND NOT PREDETERMINED WITH. WITH A. B. C. AND D. REQUIREMENTS UP FRONT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MEET THE LOCALS WHERE THEY ARE. SO EACH OF THE COUNTIES IS GOING TO BE IN A DIFFERENT SPOT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE EXISTING INDUSTRY INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE- WHERE THEY MIGHT NEED TO GO ARE ONCE AGO AND SO. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT WE DRAFTED THIS WAY WE WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT WE ARE OPEN TO INPUT. ON THE LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL SO WE LOOK FORWARD ANYTHING- THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. MY ONLY CONCERN AROUND THAT WOULD BE JUST THE BROAD DISCRETION FOR GOBIZ CAN CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN WHICH- PROPOSALS AREN'T LOOKED EQUALLY OR DEPENDING ON WHO IS MAKING THE PROPOSAL- HOW OLD. GO BIZ IS. I GUESS HOW GOBIZ WOULD EVENTUALLY JUST DECIDE. WHICH ONE SMALL FORWARD AND WITH WHICH COUNTY. I TAKE THAT AND IF ALL NOTED OUR BIGGEST A FILTER THAT EXISTS IN THE TRAILER BILL AND SPECIFYING ELIGIBILITY IS THAT A IT COUNTY IS ONLY ELIGIBLE IF IT'S IN A HIGH POVERTY OR HIGH EMPLOYMENT AREA. SO THAT BASICALLY LIMITS IT DOWN TO AT THIS POINT TEN COUNTIES SO FROM ARGUE THAT IS A BIG MITIGATING AGAINST THE CONCERN YOU'RE RAISING BUT WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. AND WHAT HAPPENED FINAL QUESTIONS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE STABLE OF A CIVILIZATION FUNDS ARE GONE. I WILL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE ABLE TO. CONTINUE OR FUNCTION AT THAT POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT SO THE- THE IDEA IS THAT. THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS- FROM. WORKING TOWARDS APPLYING APPLYING AND THEN. PURSUING A PROJECT THAT'S GRANT FUNDED HERE WE WOULD BE THINK VERY CLOSE ATTENTION WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES- SO WE DO ANTICIPATE WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING AND WHEN WE'RE WORKING OUT OF THIS IS A FINAL PROJECT THAT- HAVING A PLANT THAT'S REASONABLE AND FEASIBLE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY- AFTER THE FUNDING. FALLS OFF WOULD BE A CRITICAL PART. THANK YOU FOR THAT IF THEREARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT ISSUE AND HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. I WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE FISCAL SPRING FISCAL. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MERRIAM BARCELONA ENGINEER- AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING US TODAY IN OUR SPRING FINANCE- LETTERS. TODAY F. THIS CALLOUS ASKING FOR THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. FIFTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING. AND SIXTY FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS ACROSS THREE SPECIFIC- REQUESTS. THE FIRST IS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROLS AND COMPLIANCE UNIT. AND THE FISCAL SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL SYSTEMS- IN IN THE WORLD. AND IS CONSIDERED CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THERE'S SOME DOES JUST ADD ADDITIONAL BELTS AND SUSPENDERS TO OUR SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE IT IS A SECURE. I'M SYSTEM THAT SECOND SPRING WATER- TRANSITIONS CONSULTANT WORKLOAD. I HAD TO STATE STAFF AND STARTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE WORKLOAD WORKLOAD BACKLOG THAT WE HAVE- ACCRUED OVER THE YEARS OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT. AND THE THIRD AND FINAL SPRING FINANCE LETTER IS TO ON BOARD- TWO OF THE TEN DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS- AND START THE ON BOARDING OF THE THIRD ONE TO START THOSE CONVERSATIONS- AS THE COMMITTEE MAY RECALL THERE WERE TEN DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS. THAT HAD MODERN ERP ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHEN WE WERE DEPLOYING THE FISCAL SYSTEM AND THEY WERE DEFERRED UNTIL THE END OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF THOSE SYSTEMS AND SO THERE'S A LAPSE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE ON BOARDING OF. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TO BE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STARTING THE WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. CALTRANS AND THEN IN THAT LAST B. C. P. WE ARE ALSO ASKING FOR. SOME SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTED RESOURCES TO ASSIST US IN WORKING WITH BOTH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF THEIR- THAT HUMAN CAP THAT CS PS THE PAYROLL SYSTEM. AND THE HR MODERNIZATION EFFORTS AND THEY ARE WORKING WITH AGAIN THE I ONE OF THE LARGEST EXPENDITURE ITEMS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CAPTURED IS CURRENTLY CAPTURED IN OUR- ACCOUNTING SYSTEM OF COURSE IS PAYROLL- SO THAT WILL BE. THOSE ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS NEED TO TRANSITION. I'M I THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE L. A. O. FOR THEIR ON GOING WORK WITH US OVER THE YEARS. IT HAS BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY TO GET FISCAL TO WHERE IT IS TODAY LAST YEAR WE DID THREE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS A BANKING TRANSACTIONS IN OUR SYSTEM. IN NEARLY A HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS IN ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS THROUGH THE FISCAL SYSTEM. SO IT IS A- QUITE A QUITE A FEAT THAT WE HAVEN'T ACHIEVED ALLEN WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH WITH- BOTH LIKE I SAID DOOR STAFF AS WELL AS- THE L. A. O. TO ADDRESS THE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND HOW TO MOVE US ULTIMATELY TO ON THAT BOOK OF RECORD AND TO AND STATE AND MAKING SURE. THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DEPLOYED. IS MAINTAINS TO THE CURRENT LEVEL STAYS MODERN- AND SECURE. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. THANK YOU A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I BELIEVE A IS WROTE. BERMAN OF FINANCES NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME. L. A. L. BRIAN MINSKER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR ANALYSIS OF FISCAL SPRING FINANCE LETTERS ARE INCLUDED IN TODAY'S AGENDA SO WE'LL TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF- IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS STARTING IN EARNEST LATER THIS MONTH. THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE TWO IMPORTANT DECISIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THEIR AFTER SUCH AS IF AND WHEN FISCAL WILL BECOME THE STATE'S BOOK OF RECORD. SO THESE DECISIONS MADE BY THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE CLEARLY COMMUNICATED TO THE LEGISLATURE TO INFORMANTS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FUTURE BUDGET ACTIONS AND POLICY DIRECTION. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE CLEAR ON WHAT WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE WHAT DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN PROJECT PARTNERS MUST BE ADDRESSED. AND WHAT DECISIONS MUST BE MADE TO FINISH THE PROJECT AS ENVISIONED. TO ENSURE THIS REPORT IS DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY A CERTAIN DATE THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO ADOPT PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WITHHOLD SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR USER REQUESTED SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS. UNTIL THE REPORT IS SUBMITTED. ALSO WE HAVE REVIEWED THE STAFF COMMENTS IN THE AGENDA ON POSSIBLE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO RESPOND TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROJECT INCLUDING SOME RAISED IN OUR ANALYSIS. AND THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR FISCO TO BEGIN ONBOARDING ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS IF POSSIBLE. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE ELEMENTS PROPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HAVE MERIT BUT WHAT ARE MORE QUESTIONS BUT- ASIAN AND THE LEGISLATURE. ARE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE RECOMMENDATION IS INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE BOTH UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS AND WORKLOAD THAT REMAIN. IN COULD INFORM FUTURE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DISCUSSIONS. SIMILARLY WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE BUT I UNDERSTAND THE MERITS OF POSSIBLE FUNDING TO ON BOARD ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENT SOONER. WHERE THE SUB COMMITTEE TO AGREE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL BALLOT BILL LANGUAGE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ON. BUDGET TRAILER BILLS. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE WE HEARD ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON MARCH FIRST WHEN WE DISCUSS THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AUDIT ON THE FISCAL SYSTEM STAFF CRAFTED THIS RECOMMENDATION TO RESPOND TO THE LACK OF CERTAINTY AROUND. CASH FUNCTIONS OF THE CONTROLLER THE GOAL OF THE TRAILER BILL IS TO HAVE CLEAR DEADLINES FOR THESE REMAINING ROJECT ACTIVITIES.

SO PROPER STAFFING FOR THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND TO DO THESE THINGS THAT IN SOME CASES IN JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER MINUTE MEDICARE IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY. COST THE COUNTY'S MONEY. FOR THEM TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IT HELPS THE STATE ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IS VERY IMPORTANT EXAMPLE AND LOSING MONEY IS LARGE SCALE SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ENJOYS A PROPERTY TAX EXLUSION THAT EXCLUSION IS CURRENTLY COSTING KERN COUNTY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.
