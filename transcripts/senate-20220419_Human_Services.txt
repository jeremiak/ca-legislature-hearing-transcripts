US SENATOR TITLE HE'S PRESENTING SENATE BILL TEN NINETY TWO. CENTER TIED UP THANK YOU. SO GOOD ARE GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT SB TEN NINETY TO THE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES ACT CHANGES AIMED AT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PARTICULAR PEOPLE OF COLOR. CAN MANY FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS ABOUT THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVE AND IN HEARINGS ABOUT THOSE SERVICES. REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE ETHNICITY ENGLISH PROFICIENCY OR ABILITY TO AFFORD LEGAL COUNSEL DISABILITY SERVICES ACT PROVIDES INDIVIDUALS WITH. AN ENTITLEMENT A RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUAL REQUIRES TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THE REALITY OF THE SYSTEM. IS HAT MANY INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES FACE CHALLENGES IN ACCESSING THOSE NEEDED SERVICES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CONSUMERS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH ACCESS TO NECESSARY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THREE KEY AREAS THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLAN PROCESS INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION MEDIATION. AND FAIR HEARINGS. THESE CHANGES ARE PROPOSED IN RESPONSE TO A NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT PUBLISHED BY DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DISABILITY VOICES UNITED THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE AND THE STANFORD INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES LONG POLICY PROJECT THAT FOUND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES ENCOUNTER NUMEROUS BARRIERS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE. THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAN TO ENACT. THROUGH THESE CHANGES WE SEEK TO MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IT SERVES INCREASING ACCESS TO SERVICES AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. WHILE ALSO WORKING TO INCREASE UNDERSTANDING IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND REESTABLISH TRUST BETWEEN THE SYSTEM AND THOSE AT THE FOR. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDED LETTERS OF SUPPORT ANALYSIS AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE INDIVIDUAL SHARED THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THROUGH EMAILS PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEES EMAIL ACCOUNT. THIS SUPPORT PRIMARILY FROM CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THOSE FOR THE FOR THESE PROPOSED REFORMS. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY PRIMARY WITNESSES. TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH A DISABILITY SERVICES SYSTEM AND THEIR EXPERTISE ON THESE ISSUES ARE LIZABETH ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL MYSTIC OUT CO FOUNDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INTEGRATED COMMITTEE COLLABORATIVE WAS ALSO THE MOTHER OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WITH DOWN SYNDROME WHO SERVED. THROUGH THE WESTERN REGIONAL CENTER IN LOS ANGELES. AND VIVIAN HOLLEY SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WAS ALSO A CIVIL INTERBRED WITH AUTISM WHO IS SERVED TO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. IF WE CAN HAVE OUR WITNESSES COME FORWARD THAT ARE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT. OF SB TEN NINETY TWO THEY'LL EACH HAVE- TEN MINUTES AND IF YOU CAN RESTATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. AND YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH GOMES AND I AM THE PROUD MOTHER OF A SON WITH DOWN SYNDROME. I AM ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE. WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS LED BY PARENTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS AS WELL AS SELF ADVOCATES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE HER TESTIMONY TODAY. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR. FOR BEING THE CHAMPION OF OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU FROM FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS TODAY ABOUT WHAT IT'S BEEN IN OUR HEARTS FOR MANY YEARS AND TODAY IS THERE IS THERE IS A GREAT DAY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS OKAYED IT FOR THOUSANDS OF LATINO FAMILIES. WE WORK PEER TO PEER AS WE TRY TO NAVIGATE THE ROADBLOCKS AND BARRIERS FOUND WITHIN THE COMPLEX REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. WE CAN BEAR WITNESS TO THE CHALLENGES AND RESISTANCE FAMILIES OFTEN FACE. MANY FEEL HELPLESS AND VOICELESS AFTER BEING DENIED A SERVICE BY A GHOST COMMITTEE USUALLY KNOWN BY THE POS FOR THE CLINICAL TEAM THOSE ARE THE COMMITTEES. THEY FEEL LIKE THE AUTOMATIC RESPONSE FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER WHEN MAKING A REQUEST IS MOST ALWAYS TO START WITH THEIR WELL KNOWN CULTURE OF KNOWN. WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE CULTURE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THAN IT DOES WITH THE CULTURAL COMMUNITY. THE CULTURE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. USUALLY THIS HAS FAMILIES FACE A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY AND POLICY WHICH OFTEN GETS IN THE WAY OF INDIVIDUALS OBTAINING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THE END FOR PROCESS MAKES FAMILIES HAVE TO VILIFY THEIR LOVED ONES. AND MANY TIMES INFORMATION SHARING COLLECTED IS LATER USED AGAINST THEM. THE PROCESS IS NOT ONLY INTIMIDATING BUT HUMILIATING AND MANY FAMILIES HERE THAT THEY HAVE TO BEG FOR SERVICES THAT THEIR CHILDREN NEED. PERSONALLY WHEN FAMILIES FIND THEMSELVES CONFRONTED BY AN ATTORNEY THAT WAS HIGHER BY THE REGIONAL CENTER AND PAID BY TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THESE HEARINGS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT HAVING AN ATTORNEY OF THEIR OWN. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MOST OF US CAN AFFORD. WHAT I SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS A REALITY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT REGIONAL CENTERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER AS PARTNERS NOT WORKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. HE WAS DECISIONS MAKING SUPPOSED TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE ROADBLOCKS MANY HAVE JUST GIVEN UP AND PURSUED THE SERVICES. OR STOP PURSUING THE SERVICES THAT THEIR LOVED ONE'S NEEDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS HOPE WE BELIEVE IN SENATE BILL TEN NINETY TWO AND WE BELIEVE THAT HE WILL ENSURE. THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY HAS A VOICE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS OUR LIVES. WE BELIEVE THAT HE WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT FOR. ANY MANY REGIONAL CENTER MEETINGS THAT ADDRESSES THEIR SERVICES. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS MAKE A BETTER EFFORT TO RESOLVE% DISPUTES INFORMALLY WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL HEARING. SB TEN NINETY TWO IS ABOUT EQUITY. I STRONGLY URGE TO SUPPORT SB TEN NINETY TWO AND I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY TESTIMONY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. YOU CAN STATE YOUR NAME AND OF AN ASSOCIATION AND YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HER TADO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS VIVIAN HAN I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO THE SIBLING OF A PERSON WITH AUTISM MY BROTHER IS SERVED BY THE EAST LOS ANGELES REGIONAL CENTER. SENATE TEN NINETY TWO IS ABOUT CHANGING THE WAY THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WORKS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY FELT THE LEAST EMPOWERED IN IT. TOO MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FEEL OVERWHELMED WHEN THEY DISAGREE WITH THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND ARE USHERED INTO A COMPLICATED QUILES I JUDICIAL HEARING PROCESS THAT FEELS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. WHICH MOST PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE PUBLIC BENEFITS ME CANNOT AFFORD IN CALIFORNIA LIKE I HSS OR CALFRESH NOT ONLY RECOGNIZE THIS FACT THEY HAVE DONE A FAR BETTER JOB OF DESIGNING THEIR DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND HEARING SYSTEMS AROUND IT. AND THE FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION FOR PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY. MEANING THE PLACE MUCH MORE EMPHASIS ON WORKING OUT PROBLEMS INFORMALLY. THEY'RE HEARING OFFICERS DON'T JUST DECIDE CASES. THEY HOPE SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTORNEYS TO REPRESENT THEM BY WALKING THEM STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE LEGAL PROCESS. AND THEY HAVE ADVISORY COMMITTEES WHERE PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN GIVE FORMAL INPUT ON HOW THE HEARING PROCESS CAN WORK BETTER FOR THEM. CURRENTLY NONE OF THESE FEATURES EXIST IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. SENATE BILL TEN NINETY YOU WOULD CHANGE THAT BY ADDING THESE AND OTHER REFORMS TO THE LANHAM ACT. LOOTING ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AND TO HAVE A VOICE IN ANY MEETING WITH DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR SERVICES ARE BEING MADE. AND REQUIRING HERE IT APPEARS TO BE TRAINED ON RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WITH TRAININGS BEING COLD LED BY PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE THANK PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS THIS SENTUL TO ACHIEVING EQUITY. SENATE BILL TEN NINETY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE A MEANINGFUL VOICE IN THE DECISIONS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT AFFECT THEIR LIVES WE URGE AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL TODAY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD- LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IF POSSIBLE I'D LOVE TO SIGN ON AS A CO AUTHOR- AND ALSO TO MOVE THE DATE THAT I SAY THAT MOVED ABILITY APPROPRIATE YOU CAN DOWN OKAY I'D LIKE TO DO THAT- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK- ALL OF THE ADVOCATES FOR MAKING THEIR WAY TO SACRAMENTO FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT. HEARING I TO WANT TO RECOGNIZE MISS GOMEZ I HAVE PARTISAN NEEDED- IN ICC'S IS ETHOS ON A FEW OCCASIONS. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A GROUP OF ADVOCATES THAT. KNOW THEIR RIGHTS. LOVE THEIR CHILDREN AND ARE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT SEES THEM BOTH THE CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IS WORKING REALLY DILIGENTLY TO MOVE US TO- THE FULLEST. UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT SELF THE TEMPERAMENT NATION MEANS FOR OUR FAMILIES AND THIS IS WHAT I TEN NINETY TWO IS ABOUT. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEIR CLIENTS CAN OFTENTIMES TURN ADVERSARIAL. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ABOUT HEARINGS IS DUE PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS FAIR THAT IS OBJECTIVE THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AND THAT MAKES ROOM AT THE TABLE FOR CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE- AND HOW CLIENTS ARE LIVING. AND I THINK THIS IS THE END AND BEHIND THIS BILL WHICH IS WHY I SUPPORTED SO I'M AND I THINK THIS IS ALSO A COMMUNITY THAT REMAINS ON THE MARGINS. THE I. D. D. COMMUNITY REMAINS ON THE MARGINS AND WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO MOVE THEM TO THE CENTER. SO I JUST WANNA SELL BE DISORDER SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU SIR COMMERCENTRE PAN. THANK YOU I TO WANT TO THANK CENTER TADO FOR LEADERSHIP AND IN OFFERING THIS BILL- OF ACTUALLY- WE'VE- PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TOGETHER I ACTUALLY- CHAIRED THAT SUB. AND EVEN BEFORE THAT AND- AND ACTUALLY WON THE PERSISTENT CHALLENGES WE FACE- IN TERMS OF OUR OVERSIGHT IN THAT COMMITTEE. HAS BEEN ACTUALLY- RACIAL DISPARITIES OTHER DISPARITIES THAT WE SAW IN THE- THE SYSTEM THAT WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND FACT UP NO OTHER LEGISLATORS HAVE. WORK TO CARRY BILLS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- I KNOW THAT THE- DEPARTMENT SERVICES AS ALSO- WORKED ON THIS ISSUE TO AND YOU KNOW WE HAD- YES SIR HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE DIRECTOR ABOUT IT AND- SO FORTH. BUT I THINK ALSO HEARD THOUGH IN IN THOSE HEARINGS- FROM- I'M NOT JUST ADVOCATES BUT FROM PEOPLE RECEIVING SERVICES IS THAT- D. A DE FAIRE HEARING PROCESS. WAS HELD IT WAS NOT WHAT WAS NOT WORKING AND IN FACT DOES SEEM TO BE JUST A THE AGE OF THE CALL. IN THE- FAMILY COMES AND SALAS WHO GETTING SERVE AND HE WASN'T SERVED SO FOR. SO IT IS SO I DO PER OUR TO YOU KNOW- THAT TO THE NEEDED AND I AM THAT. SELF HAS BUT IT IS IT'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT- CAN APPRECIATE THAT THE LEADERS OF OUR- SAID LOOK WE PUT- THIS FULL. I JUST FOR AND IN AND PUSH THE INDUSTRY INTO THE PART TO THIS FORWARD. WELL THINGS WOULD MAKE NOTE AND I THINK DALLAS IS A POINTS OUT- THAT- IN THIS PROPOSAL- THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT IT ACTUALLY IN THIS PUT THIS BILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY ASK THE PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES INSTEAD OF- H. TO. ACTUALLY- TO HELP HOLD. AND I HOPE THAT AND I DO IS THE WE HAVE. THE CIVIL MORE LEE. APPROACH A MORE CONSUMER DRIVEN PROCESS NOT DURING THE WHOLE DISCUSSION EVENTUAL FIGURE OUT LIKE YOU KNOW WHICH- WHICH BOX. NOTE THAT THIS THE SERIES WILL FINALLY LAND IN BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE TRY NOT TO SET UP AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONS THE PURPOSE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS THE PURPOSE OF THE VOTE NOW THAT THAT THE DDS IS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND HOW TO FIGHT WITH THEM. AND SO I IS SO- I HOPE IS THIS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD IS. PROBABLY THE L. ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS IN THIS BILL YOU KNOW IT'S THE DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN AND EVENTUALLY WE COME TOGETHER. THAT WE DO MAKE A PROCESS THAT. WORKS BETTER FOR FAMILIES. AND ALSO IS MORE EQUITABLE BECAUSE CLEARLY WE HAVE SEEN YEAR AFTER YEAR AND I KNOW BROUGHT IT UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN I WAS. IS ON BUDGETS OF THREE. THAT WE SEE THE OUTCOMES ARE NOT EQUITABLE. THAT THE SERVICES ARE NOT ACTIVELY- A GROUP DELIVERED OR ARE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS TO ITSELF. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED- OUR STATION THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE ANYONE'S REALLY LOOK YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WENT FOR THE HEARING PROCESS ITSELF. SO WE'VE WE HAVE DONE OTHER THINGS TO TRY TO SEND OF ICE BUT I THINK IT'S TIME TO DO THIS AND- ALEX DOUBLE BE SUPPORTING. BILL ON MY THE BILL. THE AUTHOR. AND I KNOW MY GOOD FRIEND READY SECONDED IT I'D LIKE TO SECOND OR THIRD IT. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE COMMENTS FROM THE- COMMITTEE. SIMILAR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE ALL POSITIVE COMMENTS IN SUPPORT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YES I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE IT THAT'S OKAY- IT YOUR DURING THE TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS ARE PROVIDED. FOR THIS BILL I HEARD TWO THINGS. ONE IS A SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE THAT IS NOT WORKING WE KNOW WE KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU ALL VERY WELL KNOW THAT MORE THAN US AND PEOPLE ON THE NOT THE SECOND THING IS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER- WITH THE REGIONAL SALES THAT WE ALL WANT TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK WORK FOR EVERYBODY AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD. HERE TODAY. AND I WOULD. IN ALL SAY THAT THIS REMINDS ME OF. OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REMARKS AT THE SUMMIT FOR DEMOCRACY. AND AT IT AND IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO SHOW THAT BECAUSE IT IT. THOSE REMARKS REALLY INSPIRED AND THE WORK THAT I DO BUT- BUT I THINK THAT UP. THE TESTIMONY IN THE COMMENTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY YOU ALL TODAY. ALSO VERY MUCH INSPIRED ME. AND SO ARE. DURING THE SUMMIT HE SAID THAT- AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY WARREN OF ALMOST WORRYING OF ALL BY INCREASING THE DISSATISFACTION OF PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD WITH. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT THEY FEEL THEY'RE FEELING TOO LITTLE FOR THEIR NEEDS. IN MY VIEW THIS IS A DEFINING CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME. DEMOCRACY GOVERNMENT. OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. FOR THE PEOPLE CAN AT TIMES BE FRAGILE. BUT IT IS ALSO INHERENTLY RESILIENT IT'S CAPABLE OF SELF CORRECTION AND IT'S CAPABLE OF SELF IMPROVEMENT. YES THE MARCUS IS HARD WE ALL KNOW THAT IT WORKS BEST WITH CONSENSUS AND COOPERATION. WHEN PEOPLE AND PARTIES THAT MIGHT HAVE OPPOSING VIEWS SIT DOWN AND FIVE FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER THINGS BEGIN TO WORK. AND IT'S THE BEST WAY TO UNLEASH HUMAN POTENTIAL AND DEFEND HUMAN DIGNITY. AND SOLVE BIG PROBLEMS AND IT'S UP TO US TO PROVE THAT. AND QUOTE. I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT I HEARD HERE TODAY PEOPLE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME HERE TO WORKING WITH US TO WORKING WITH YOU OUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE SO WORKS. FOR US ALL. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN WHICH IS BEST. ALL SPORTS. WE NEED. FOR THE MULTIPLE THAT EVERY NEED I A COMIC THAT.

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED IN THAT HISTORY IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE HAS AN IDEA YOU GIVEN CREDIT. AND THE CREDIT GOES TO THE TREASURE THE CITY CALIFORNIA FIONA MARC. SHE CAME UP WITH A PRETTY BRILLIANT IDEA. THAT DOES PRETTY NIFTY. IT IMPROVES A PROCESS AND SAVES MONEY. AND SAVE MONEY. WE GET THAT OPPORTUNITY CONSIDER THAT HERE TODAY AS A RESULT OF S. B. A NINE. A SEVENTY THREE NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS MEASURE DIRECTS MORE REVENUE TO S. S. I. N. S.'S P. RECIPIENTS BY CUTTING TIES WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEY'RE COSTLY BUREAUCRACY AND METHOD OF ISSUING S. S. P. BENEFITS. YOU CURRENTLY CONTRACT WITH GOVERNMENT CITY CALIFORNIA CONTRACTS DEVELOPMENT. AND WE PAY ONE THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTEEN CENTS PER PAYMENT THAT'S WHAT OUR OVERHEAD COST IS OKAY. THAT TRANSLATES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHAT WE'RE SPENDING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE BEHALF A LOT OF MONEY. IN THIS NUMBER WILL CONTINUE TO GROW YOUR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE THE THIRTEEN DOLLAR MINISTRY TO FEE IS TIED TO A CPI CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. YOU'RE TALKING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY IN TODAY'S WORLD IS BUDGET DOES. BUT IN FIVE YEARS TO BILLION DOLLARS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ARE MILLION DOLLARS IS. A LOT OF MONEY OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS SPENDING THE MONEY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. R. O. S. S. I. S. IS P. BENEFITS USERS STRUGGLING MORE THAN EVER TO MAKE ENDS MEET INFLATION COSTS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW. AND FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT ARE DEALING WITH PARTICULARLY HOUSING COSTS. SO THIS MEASURE OFFERS A RATHER. CLEVER APPROACH THAT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE CAME UP WITH. THE DIRECT MORE DOLLARS TOWARD THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BY. ALLOWING DSS THE CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER GOVERNMENT VENDOR TO ADMINISTER THE S. S. P. PROGRAM AT A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE. THIS VENDOR WOULD WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH CALIFORNIA TO. TO THEN BRING THE PROCESS OF ISSUING PAYMENTS IN STATE. THEREBY RESULTING IN EVEN MORE GENERAL. REASON CREATING CALIPH MORE CALIFORNIA JOBS. BY ADMINISTERING THE PAYMENTS OF THEIR OWN WE COULD ULTIMATELY SAVE AS I SUGGESTED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THIS MEASURE ISN'T JUST RIGHTEOUS IT'S COMMONSENSE AND IT'S ABOUT. GOOD GOVERNMENT AS IT GETS CASEY O'CONNOR VERY BRILLIANT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR OUR GREAT STATE TREASURES HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT AND TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A CENTER HERTZBERG STATED I AM CASEY O'CONNOR STATE TREASURE LAWS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR THE TREASURES PROUD TO SPONSOR SB NINE SEVENTY THREE. AND WE KIND OF CAME TO THIS BILL AS THE TREASURER IS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ACHIEVING A BETTER LIFE EXPERIENCE ALSO KNOWN AS CAL ABLE BOARD. THAT IS A NATIONAL NETWORK FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION STATE TREASURES AS WELL THAT'S WERE ABLE STARTED WITH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SHE ALSO CHAIRS THE FEDERAL COMMITTEE WHICH IS NOW THE FEDERAL NETWORK SO IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE ALL KNOW THAT A LOT OF THOSE. THAT ARE CAL ABLE AND A LOOKOUT HOLDERS THEY ARE SSI PAYMENT RECIPIENTS AND SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEIR FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED AND IS ALREADY A GROUP OF FOLKS. WHO HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE SAVING MONEY THERE SOMETHING TOM SOMETIMES UNINTENDED TAX TREATMENT TO THE MONEY THEY SAY. THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED IT OUT FINANCIAL LIMBO SO TO SPEAK SO AT THESE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE TREASURES CONFERENCES WE SPEAK WITH THE FIDUCIARY LEADERS FROM OTHER STATES THERE'S FORTY EIGHT STATE TREASURES WERE PART OF THIS NATIONAL NETWORK IT'S BIPARTISAN THEY'RE ALL FIDUCIARY LEADERS. AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS SO IN OUR CAR AND OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND BEST PRACTICES THE DISCUSSION HELP US COME UP WITH UNIQUE SOLUTION TO THIS TO POTENTIALLY CUT DOWN ON LOWER LOWER GOVERNMENT SPENDING. AND LEARN FROM THOSE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO CUT DOWN THESE COSTS FOR THEIR STATES. REALLOCATE THE MONEY SAVED DIRECTLY TO THOSE IT'S INTENDED TO SERVE AND WE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT RAISING TAXES OR BEEN HIT TO THE GENERAL FUND. SB NINE SEVENTY THREE AS IS NOT REQUIRED. S. S. TO CONTRACT WITH EITHER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION HAS SSA OR ANOTHER STATE THAT IS ABLE TO WILLING TO ADMINISTER THE STATE'S SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAM. THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO DIRECT MORE RESOURCES TOWARD THOSE MOST IN NEED BY REDUCING THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE S. S. P. FOR THE AGED BLIND AND DISABLED. AS A SENATOR NOTED IF WE CAN CUT THESE COSTS IN HALF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THEN TO HAVE THOSE THOSE COSTS. GOING TO THE- AT A RATE OF UP. TO THIS BILL CREATE THE- I STATE. TO SEE WHO CAN PERFORM THIS FOR US IMMEDIATELY TO START SAVING MONEY IMMEDIATELY AND HOUSE WHILE TEACHING US HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL PERMANENTLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE APPRECIATE ON THE WORK IN THE CONSIDERATION THE COMMITTEE. AND WE EXPECT THE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OKAY THIS BILL DOES HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- BUT ARE THERE. ANY TO WE HAVE NO LEAD WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO WE HAVE ANY.

PROMOTER I CAN'T FIGHT YEAH I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS LOCAL PLACES BELONG CALL THANK YOU. OKAY UP NEXT WE HAVE A FIVE SENATE BILL NINE NINE SIX. BY SENATOR COM LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB NINE SIX SIX THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE COW WORKS PROGRAM IS TO MOVE FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY AND TOWARDS. I SHOULD. EIGHT THOSE LAWS I AM CARRYING SB NINE SIX SIX WHICH WOULD HELP IN TWO WAYS IT WOULD REPEAL LIMITATIONS ON ASSETS WITH REGARDS TO CAO WORKS ELIGIBILITY AND IT WOULD REPEAL THE ONE HUNDRED OUR STANDARD USED HERMAN AT THAT PROVISION OF PARENTAL SUPPORT DUE TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT OF THEIR PARENT. ASSET UNFAIRLY COURAGE CALIFORNIA FROM SAVING FINANCIALLY. RECIPIENTS FEAR SAVING BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF EMERGENCY SAVINGS WILL MAKE THEM APPEAR LESS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. BUT AS A RULE. BLACK THIS IS NEEDED TO COPE COMMA FINANCIAL SETBACKS SUCH AS GETTING A CAR FIXED OR MEDICAL EMERGENCY. THE MAJORITY OF CHARACTER KANSEN RECIPIENTS NEVER COME CLOSE TO EXCEEDING THE ASSET LIMIT LESS THAN 1% OF TOTAL COWARDS CASES ARE DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE THEY IF HE'D CAN. VEHICLE AT LIMIT. ARE MORE LIKELY GET STRUCK BY. THAN TO BE- DISQUALIFIED STILL COUNTY WORKERS ARE REQUIRED TO SCREEN ALL APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS TO VERIFY THEIR ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE RULE. IS AT MATED THAT ELIMINATING SAID TEST COULD RESULT IN SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS. SB NINE NINE SIX WOULD ALSO REMOVE THE CAL WORKS ONE HUNDRED OUR ROLE IN THE PAST STAYS WERE BARRED FEDERALLY FROM PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO HOUSEHOLDS UNLESS IT OUT IN THE HOME WAS DEPRIVED OF PARENTAL SUPPORT. NO MATTER HOW IN THE FAMILY IS. UNDER THIS NOW DEFUNCT FEDERAL RULE TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WERE DEFINED UNEMPLOYED IF BOTH PARENTS WORK LESS ONE HUNDRED HOURS IN THE MONTH. UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FEDERAL LAW STATES WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO RETAIN A LOT MANY REPEAL IT. WE DID NOT. THE DEPRIVATION TEST IS ESTIMATED TO IMPACT THOUSANDS OF POOR TWO PARENT WORKING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THIS. DENYING THEM CAL WORKS ASSISTANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PRIMARY WAGE EARNER WORKED TOO MANY HOURS. SO YOU WORK TOO MANY HOURS TO MEAN YOUR PORCH IS MEAN YOU WORK TOO MANY HOURS. SB NINE NINE SIX WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WHOSE PRIMARY WAGER. IS WORKING FOR A LOW. BY ALLOWING THESE FAMILIES TO QUALIFY FOR CAL WORKS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY HOURS THEY WORK IF THEIR INCOME IS BELOW THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLDS. THESE OUTDATED AND UNNECESSARY CAL WORKS RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTRARY TO THE STATED GOALS OF THE PROGRAM WHICH ENCOURAGES WORK AND FAMILY UNITY. AS WELL AS MAINTAINING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON POVERTY.

AND THIS COMMITTEE ARM FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO HAS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF REMOVING A BUNCH BE ABLE TO LIVE FOR ASSISTANCE BEING ABLE TO GET ON ASSISTANCE THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED- THE ASSET TEST IS REALLY A NEW. ASSET EXAMPLE THE PAPER CHASE THAT THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH WHEN WE ALL KNOW OF THESE CLIENTSCOME IN THE DOOR. HAVE THE ASSETS SO WE'RE- IN GOVERNMENT SINCE. THAT COULD BE UTILIZED. ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE TEND TO QUE IN. THE KIND OF ISSUES AND BEAR THEY HAVE A THEIR LIVES BUT- WERE TRYING TO DOWN YOU. THAT'S THE.

FIND THAT PERSON TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING CAL WORKS. IS NOT VERY EFFICIENT USE OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS I'D ALSO POINT OUT THAT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT. IT'S AMAZING THAT IN A PROGRAM CALLED CAL WORKS WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO WORK BY PUTTING AN HOUR LIMIT ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN WORK.

B. ELEVEN FORTY ONE IS THE REPLACEMENT OF ELECTRONIC BENEFIT. THEFT OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE EBT CARDS. I SUBJECT THE SAME KIND OF STUFF THAT OTHERS ARE THIS- AGE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THIS BILL SIMPLY. ALLOWS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM OF THEFT- AS TO THEIR EBT CARD TO BASICALLY I HAVE THAT AMOUNT REPLACED- AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IF YOU'RE THE VICTIM OF A CRIME. ME TODAY MY CURLED WITH THE WEST THERE ARE A LOT OF POVERTY AND ANDREW BECAUSE IRAQIS WITH THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES. WHAT SIR. THANK YOU CENTER MADAM CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW POVERTY HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- THIS IS A CASE THAT THE BILL THAT REALLY INNATE ANIMAL OUT OF A LAWSUIT THAT WE DID WITH THE- THEY FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES AND I LET MY COLLEAGUE FOR LAUGHS THIS BETTER MORE RETAILERS. BUT FOR MANY YEARS- WE HAVEN'T I CONTINUE THE NUMBER OF THE CAR BROWN CALIFORNIA- AND WHAT THAT'S WHAT. A SOMEWHERE TO GET THIS ISSUE IS STILL UP AND CODIFY THE LOS. TO READ THE WAY IT USED TO HENCE THE NEED FOR THE BILL- BUT THE PROBLEM OF BENEFIT THEFT IS AN ONGOING AND SERIOUS ONE WE HEAR ABOUT THESE REPORTS STATEWIDE ON A REGULAR BASIS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE A. G. ACTUALLY ARRESTED SOMEBODY WHO STOLE. FIRST ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE. WAS ANY. IT'S ALL. I THINK THE- OVER HUNDRED GOT. WAIT SO THE NEED FOR OF IN THIS IS REALLY IN IN AND SOMETHING WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT- AT ELEVEN. TONIGHT AND WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM THE WILL TRUMP- LEGALLY FOUNDATION NOW. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE THE FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON. THESE AGAIN HI GOOD AFTERNOON. HAVE A POLITICS GOOD AFTERNOON NONE OF A PROVIDER MARK THE COMMITTEE BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FORTY WHICH I. SUPPORT OF ONE I THINK SENATOR ROBERT FOR INTRODUCING. MY NAME IS JESSICA DOCKET AND ON THE TOP THIRTY WITH LAUGHABLE M. AS PART OF THE TEAM RETURN ALONG WITH WESTERN CENTER WHO BROUGHT THE ORTEGA V. JOHN CASE. WHICH HELD THAT LONG OVERLOOKED STATE REGULATIONS. BUT APART. TWENTY BOB MIGHT THE TOP MANY SKIMMING OF THE YEARS AND SEEN HOW PAINFUL IS FOR LOW INCOME HOW. WHICH INCLUDE YOUNG CHILDREN BEING OR PEOPLE LIVING WITH. IN THE HACKERS WERE GREATLY FEEL EACH ACCOUNT INFORMATION. WAIT UNTIL THE DATE THAT BENEFITS ARE LOADED ONTO THE ACCOUNT AND THEN DURING THE FAMILY'S ENTIRE FOOD ALLOTMENT FOR THE MONTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. ORTEGA'S JOHNSON THE DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO RESTORE THE STOLEN COULD BENEFIT BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE STATUTE. ONLY EXPRESSLY REQUIRES SKIN CASH BENEFITS TO BE RESTORED NOT FOOD. MY CLIENTS WOULD ASK ME. FOR THE CREDIT CARDS AND DEBIT CARDS YOU GET HACKED GET THEIR MONEY BACK IN A FEW DAYS BUT I CAN'T GET MY FOOD STAMPS BACK WHAT I NEED. SO I CAN EAT- THERE WAS NO GOOD ANSWER FOR THE COMMONSENSE QUESTION WHICH IS WHY SB ELEVEN FORTY IT'S SUCH NECESSARY LEGISLATION. THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST WEAKENING UNDER STATUTORY LAW NOT JUST STATE REGULATION. URBAN REGIONALLY DIDN'T WANT TO FOLLOW AND THEY CAN BE EASILY REMOVED BY FUTURE REGULATORY ABOUT. THIS BILL BUT ALSO CRUCIALLY MAKER REPORTING PROCESS SIMPLER FOR EVERYONE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE CLAIMS PROPERTIES FOR STOLEN CASH AND FOOD WITH SEPARATE ELIGIBILITY AND TIGHTENING RULES AND IT. RELATES BACK TO THE FACT THAT. ONE TRACK COMES FROM THE OTHER COMES REGULATION SO JUST KIND OF A RANDOM ANOMALY. MYSTIFICATION CREATES CONFUSION WITH COUNTY WORKERS TIME AND CREATES A HEADACHE FOR VICTIMS WHO ARE ALREADY STRAPPED OUT AFTER BEING ROBBED THE BENEFITS. ENOUGH NOW TO GET YOU SET UP YOUR CREDIT RULES. AND BECAUSE THE DEADLINE TO REPORT FOOD THEFT IS MUCH SHORTER FOR STERLING CACHET- I'M SORRY IT. IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN FILLING CASCADE MANY HOUSEHOLDS STILL CAN'T GET THEIR FOOD BENEFITS BACK EVEN NOW. THIS BILL WOULD BE EVERYONE A FAVOR BY UNIFIED THE UNIFYING ALL ELECTRONIC STUFF PLAN TO THINK PROCEDURE WITH A SINGLE REASONABLE TIME FRAME. AND FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THE SCHOOL THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE HERE IN THIS ROOM. KEVIN AS A CHORISTER CALIFORNIA OVER RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TO HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS WINNING OKAY AND HERE IN THIS ROOM. THREE NINE WILL MOVE ON TO TELL FROM PUBLIC COMMENT LINE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. IF YOU ARE IN. SB ELEVEN FORTY EIGHT IS ONE THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR PHONE. THAT IS IN SUPPORT AT E. ONE ONE FOUR ZERO. AND WE HAVE LINE NUMBER NINETY NINE. YOUR CALL FROM NURSE CALIFORNIANS FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE IN Q. MADAM CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE NO KNOWN OPPOSITION WITNESS BUT WILL TAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT OFFICE THIS BILL BEGINNING IN THIS ROOM. SEEN NONE. OF ONTO THE TELEPHONE PUBLIC COMMON LINE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. YOUR IN OPPOSITION OF ACT II ELEVEN FORTY ONE NINE ZERO I FOUND. THAT'S OPPOSITION SB ELEVEN FORTY. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYBODY IN HERE MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WHAT I DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON ON THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE JUST HAVE A QUESTION TO THE ALTERNATE THIS THIS IS AN AREA THAT I THINK. IT'S KIND OF. THE FUTURE RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL FACE WITHIN THE STATE AND THAT'S HAKKINEN. AND AS A WAY TO CREATE MORE MORE TENSION WITHIN OUR COMMUTE TO. IT FOLDABLE COMMUNITIES STRUGGLE EVEN MORE I. WAS WONDERING I KNOW THERE'S- THERE'S THE REPORTING PIECE ON FROM THE INDIVIDUAL BUT- WE DO TO YOU KNOW TO. FOURTEEN OF CAN INCIDENTS FROM ITALY LIKE DOES THE DEPARTMENT. IT REPORT THAT TO ANYBODY OR IS THAT JUST KIND OF GOES NO WHERE WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT- LET ME. FIRST TAKE A CRACK AND THEN DEFERRED MY WITNESSES OKAY- THE ANSWER IS YES IS PREVALENT- AS TO. THE PREVALENCE- AND IT'S BECOME A LARGER LARGER ISSUE AS FOLKS BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED- IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ACQUIRE THINGS THAT DON'T BELONG TO THEM ELECTRONICALLY. AND THEN IN TERMS OF REPORTING YES I BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY ARE REPORTING THAT WHEN THIS. IS FOUND IT IS REPORTED LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT LET ME LET ME ASK- HERALD OR OTHERS WHO ARE PRESENT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. FROM EACH OF THESE CASES HAS TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF BEING APPROVED BY THE COUNTY NOW SO- IF CDSS WANTED TO TALLY UP ALL. THE DIRT BETTER. PROCESS VENUS BY THE CAN'T BY THE COUNTIES WE GET DETERMINE NUMBER I'M NOT AWARE THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED TO DATE- BUT I THINK AS WE BOTH OF THE TWO WITNESSES FOR THE BILL THAT. IS A GROWING PROBLEM WE'RE SEEING IT IN A OFFICES- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE WERE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE PEOPLE GOT RID OFF. EIGHTEEN IS A FAIR NUMBER OF PEOPLE THIS IS. TO AYE THINK YOU'RE POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN MADAM CHAIR THAT THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD REALLY KEEP AN EYE ON AS WE GO FORWARD. AND MAY WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF TO COME BACK AND REPORT ON THE DATA. THANK YOU FOR THAT ACTUALLY- BUT THE REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE I DO HAVE A CYBER SECURITY BILL. BUT THE FOCUS IS ON. WATER AND FOOD SLASH AGRICULTURE BUT IT DOESN'T. I'M NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT. ACTUALLY EXTENDS TO. YOUR THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND I THINK THAT. THE BILL SHOULD. ACTUALLY BE EXPANDED TO ARE CRITICAL. AS FIFTY OF SEX. I MEANT TO. HAPPEN REAL UNDERSTANDING OF. WHAT HOW BAD IT IS AND WHAT MORE WE NEED TO DO TO DO RIGHT BECAUSE I I'M I'M ASSUMING IT'S AT MINIMUM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE THAT WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE ANYMORE AND SO I REALLY PPQ- BRING IN THIS TO BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND HAPPY TO. BID THAT YOU BROUGHT FORTH FALL I'LL DEVELOP TWENTY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE PAN. BUT THANK YOU AND THE SERVER OF THE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- THERE WAS A COMMENT IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS- THAT AND IT IS IT'S ROUND I GUESS THE TERM ELECTRONIC BENEFITS WHETHER THERE'S CLEARLY IN THAT VERSES THAT THE USING CASH AND FOOD BENEFITS I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO JUST CLARIFY THAT. IT'S NOT JUST PLEASE VISIT CASH. BUT I THINK IT WAS ALSO THE CONSOLE AT LEAST IN THEIR HOUSES THEY RAISE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE TERM ELECTRONIC BENEFITS IS CLEAR ENOUGH FOR WHAT WE HAVE TO BETTER DEFINE THAT OR USE ANOTHER TERMINOLOGY SO. I'M THE END OF THE- DRESS THAT AS AND CERTAINLY GIVE ME SUPPORTING THE BILL AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT YOU'LL FIX AS IT MOVES FORWARD BUT AND NOBODY HAD ANY. COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AT THIS POINT CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE BILLS TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT THAT IS. LESSENED BY VIRTUE OF ANOTHER- TAKING THAT BENEFIT. THEN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S REPLENISH ACTUALLY SO WHATEVER TERMINOLOGY. ACCOMPLISHES THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND IF WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR WILL DO SO. OKAY YEAH IT DOES MAKE NOTE. ANALYSIS AND I. AGAINST SUPPORT THE INTENT TO YOUR BILL- SOUNDS LIKE. I WISH THE BUDGET OR- AT IS THE THREE SAID TO GO TO COURT THAT THE STATION ACTUALLY HAD TO INTERPRET THE LATEST SO NARAL. THAT WITH DID NOT ALLOW. FOR THEM FOR THE ADDRESS AND TO TAKE SHOW COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEE NINE OKAY WE HAVE. AMOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD US SENATOR UMBERG WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THE THANK YOU A MANAGER YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE AND IF IT'S NOT THE CASE. THEN IT SHOULD BE THE CASE AND EITHER THROUGH YOUR BILL THIS BILL- THAT IN ADDITION TO REPLENISHING THE BENEFITS WE WANT TO. HEAD AND IDENTIFY AND- SEEK EITHER RESTITUTION OR PERHAPS BOTH OF SOME PUNISHMENT. FROM THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY PREYING UPON THOSE WITH EBT CARDS. SO IF THAT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT THEN WE WILL CONSIDER MAKING. BUT WITH THAT AND I WILL. OKAY CONTROL TO CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THIS MEASURE.

NOT SEEN BEFORE AND IT HAS IT BEEN HAS BEEN. A SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BUT- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALLOW ALONE- THE DROUGHT BECAUSE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT COSTS TO THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IN THE LOSS OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED JOBS SEE NOW ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A LONG AND ARDUOUS PROCESS.

WELL GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WILL WORK TO ALLEVIATE THE HOMELESS CRISIS BY PLANNING FUNDING AND ACCELERATING SALTER FIRST. PROJECTS FROM FRESNO TO SAN DIEGO THERE'S NOT A COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS GONE UNTOUCHED BY THE HOMELESS CRISIS SWEEPING THE STATE SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS ALLEVIATION INITIATIVES THROUGH FIFTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS FIFTEEN STATE ENTITIES. WHAT WE HAVE BROUGHT OVERWHELMING FINANCIAL FIRE POWER TO THE PROBLEM DO NOT. EXCEED SOURCE IN FIRST INTENSE OR OUTSIDE. SIMPLY PUT THIS IS JUST NOT RIGHT THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS HAS REACHED SUCH A MAGNITUDE AND THE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE TRIED HAVE FAILED AT SUCH A SCALE WE NEED AND ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO OFFER FRESH ALTERNATIVES. AS YOU MAY KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED THE HOUSING FIRST ONLY MODEL FOR ALL PROJECTS WITH STATE FUNDING WHILE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME CASES WHERE HOUSING FIRST IS NECESSARY AND VERY BENEFICIAL. PRIORITIZING PERMANENT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THAT WON'T BE USABLE UNTIL THE NEXT DECADE AT THE EXPENSE OF CREATING OPERATING AN EXISTING SHELTERS AND NONPROFITS WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT CAMPUS RIPPING INTO ACTION TODAY. IS NOT HUMANE CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE ARE DIVERSE AND CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS POPULATION IS EQUALLY DIVERSE WE MUST PROVIDE THE PALETTE OF OPTIONS REPRESENTS THE SAME. SOLUTIONS ON EVERY PERSON PROGRAMS AND SHELTERS THAT REQUIRE PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMMING AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM THIS NEW ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS HAVE FAILED. BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN CARL MORE. WITH BIPARTISAN- EXEMPTED MOTEL TELLS IN HOSTELS FROM SEACOR IF THE PROJECT CREATED SUPPORTIVE OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING SB FOUR FIFTY HELP TO ACCELERATE SHELTER CONSTRUCTION CUT RED TAPE AND GOT CALIFORNIA'S OFF THE STREETS UNFORTUNATELY THAT EXEMPTION RUNS OUT AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE BARRIERS TO SHELTER FIRST PROJECTS AND ALLOW THEM TO APPLY FOR STATE FUNDING AND ALSO EXTEND THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR SUPPORTIVE AND TRANSITIONAL HOW PLEASED TO HAVE MICHELLE STEVE AS A WITNESS FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS HE RAN ST JOHN'S PROGRAM FOR REAL CHANGE IN SACRAMENTO AND TRANSFORMED AN ORDINARY THIRTY DAY EMERGENCY SHELTER INTO A ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE EIGHTEEN MONTH THEM HELPING HOMELESS WOMEN AND CHILDREN HE HAS ALSO DONE RESEARCH INTO THE EFFECTIVENESS. FIRST SHE WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPEAK TO WHY A BROADER APPROACH TO PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO SERVICES IF NEEDED AND HUMANE. DO WE HAVE THE EXPERT WITNESS. YES I. LERI TOWARDS FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WITH THANK YOU SENATOR BATES FOR INVITING ME TO BE WITH YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF RESCUE TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. AND THE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS TODAY. LET THAT TAKE A MOMENT REFER BACK TO FIRST GRADE WHEN OUR TEACHERS ASKED US WHAT WE WANTED TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP. I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT NONE OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND RAISE THEIR HANDS TO SAY THEY WANTED TO BE HOMELESS. HOWEVER THIS IS THEIR REALITY A REALITY THAT LED TO THE NEED FOR SB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. HOUSING IS A CRUCIAL PIECE TO SOLVING HOMELESSNESS. YEAH YOU'LL SEE FROM THE CHART IN FRONT OF YOU CREEK COVE ED HIGH DATA INDICATES THAT DESPITE A HOUSING UNITS. THIS IS THE HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA. ALMOST DID NOT DECLINE. IN FACT WITH THE FURY. SIXTEEN LANE CAL WOULD THAT AS IT CALIFORNIA HAS WHEN TELLING ME I GOT HOUSING FOR A ONE FITS APPROACH THE- TO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AGAIN CREEK HELD. CALIFORNIANS AND SHELTERED. ROSE BY FORTY SEVEN POINT 1% DESPITE A 101% INCREASE IN SPENDING OVER THAT PERIOD AND RELATIVELY FAST ECONOMY. IF ENDING HOMELESS LEN MATT OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA COLLECTIVE POPULAR WOULD HAVE DECREASED GIVEN THE 333% INCREASE IN PERMANENT HOUSING UNITS. AND THANK CREEK LET I'M SHELTERBOX AS I SAID BY FORTY POINT ONE PERCENT. AND BY THIRTY THREE POINT 8% IN THE OVERALL POPULATION AGAIN THIS IS HOT A HIGHER WHICH IS THE ANNUAL RECORD THAT'S THAT REPORT DATA. RIGHT TO THE- IN BUILDING AND RUNNING ST JOHN'S ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST PROGRAMS FOR WOMEN INTERRUPTED RIGHT STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS. A PROGRAM THAT LED THOUSANDS OF SINGLE MOTHERS TO EMPLOYMENT ITSELF THE SCALABILITY AND FOR MANY TO HOMEOWNERS YEAH. THAT HOUSING IS BUT ONE PIECE ONE CRITICAL PIECE BUT ONE PIECE OF A COMPLEX PUZZLE TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. OTHER CRUCIAL PIECES INCLUDE NUMBER ONE SERVICES THEY DRIVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS. NUMBER TWO SERVICES TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE DISORDER. AND NUMBER THREE SERVICES TO ADDRESS TRAUMA ESPECIALLY THOSE HAVING INJURED THE PILOT. 78% OF TE MOTHERS WE SERVED AT ST JOHN STRUGGLED WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. 70% WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 70% WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE UCLA POLICY LAB FOUND THAT AREN'T SHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION FACES SIMILAR UNDERLYING ISSUES. AND 75% WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. HOWEVER PROGRAMS LIKE THINK JOHN PROGRAMS THAT COMBINE HOUSING WHICH REQUIREMENTS THAT ADDRESS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT PROPEL AN INDIVIDUAL AND A HOMELESSNESS. THESE PROGRAMS WERE RENDERED INELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING BECAUSE UNDER HOUSING FIRST. OUR CONSIDER AREA. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO IMAGINE RAISING CHILDREN WITHOUT AREA. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO IMAGINE THE KINGS GAME WHERE TWO TEAMS PLAYED ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT BARRIERS. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO IMAGINE BEING OPERATED ON BY A DOCTOR WHO GRADUATED FROM AND NO BARRIERS MEDICAL SCHOOL. EACH SCENARIO PRESENTS A NIGHTMARE. SB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR IS CRUCIAL TO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF TOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TOOLBOX BEYOND THE HOUSING FIRST TOOL TO REVERSE MANAGE CARRYING CRACK. UNDER A ONE TOOL SYSTEM THE ARRAY OF OPTIONS ONCE AVAILABLE TO THOSE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS HAVE BEEN ALL BUT ELIMINATED. AND THE INNOVATION AND THE HOMELESS SYSTEMS HAS BEEN DECIMATED. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN DO TO HELP THE HOMELESS ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL I ASK YOU TO REFLECT ON THAT FIRST GRADER THAT HUMAN BEINGS THAT NEVER INVENTION NEVER ENVISIONED THAT FOR HIS OR HER LIFE. SB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR IT'S CRUCIAL TO EXPANDING THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR HIM OR HER AS WELL AS THE REINSTATEMENT OF DESPERATELY NEEDED SYSTEM INNOVATION AND OPTIONS.

FOR THESE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL UNLESS THE BILL IS AMENDED TO STRIP THE HOUSING FIRST OPERA FROM BILL. THANK YOU ARE SO MUCH AND- NOW WILL BEGIN PUBLIC COMMON OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. ANY ADDITIONAL- IN THIS IN THIS ROOM OKAY ARE CAN WE MOVE TO THE TELEPHONE PUBLIC COMMENT LEVINE BILL PRESS ONE THEN ZERO YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. WE HAVE NOBODY THAT HAVE QUEUED UP FOR OPPOSITION. OKAY WHAT ARE HAVE BEEN I HEARD FROM OP ALL OPPOSITION AND ALL THOSE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT I'LL OPEN IT UP TO- COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND- MISPRICED. PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MA'AM SHIRTS CENTER BATES I- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL AND LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITE AND I THINK THERE'S A FALSE. BINARY CHOICE BEING. BY THE OPPOSITION AND IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING FIRST- BY YOUR BILL BECAUSE IT IS FAR AS I KNOW IT IS SILENT REGARDING% HOUSING FIRST CERTAINLY DOESN'T CAN DO THIS PLUS HOUSING FIRST IS THAT CORRECT. THE END OF B. R. FOR SOME FUNDING ARE THAT DON'T USE THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE OP. AND THE STATE HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS WITH THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND HAVING SERVED ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT THE REFEREE SERVICES PART OF THE PROBE THAT WE HAD FOR REUNIFICATION OF FAMILIES THE A. WELL COULD BE. GRAHAM THAT TRIP WITHOUT FOR ENTRY IN PROGRAMS IN YOUR FROM MISS. HOW SHE RAN THE ST JOHN'S PROGRAM HERE SACRAMENTO AND I WAS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WHEN ARE WE HAD A HEARING ON THAT AND THREE YOUNG WOMEN THAT CAME FORWARD. AND SPOKE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAD GOALS TO MEET WITHIN THAT PROGRAM I TO STAY SOBER AND THAT THE WAY THEY GOT SKILLS EDUCATE. SEARCH AND SO THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF HELPING PEOPLE ARE OUT OF ADDICTION AND CERTAINLY I INTO A PRODUCTIVE LIFE AND SOUL WHY WE'RE ELIMINATING THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY. WE'RE COMING IN WITH. THEIR BE A COMPETITION IT SHOULD ALL IS BE REALLY A CONTINUE ON A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT ARE THERE WERE- ANY AND ALL WHO CHOOSE THE VOLUNTARY APPROACH WHERE DOES NOT HAVE MORE RESTRICTIONS ON AND GO. AFTER LIKE IN IT YEAH TO DIE PRO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE IT EVERY CANNOT THINK THAT SENT HIM TO DO. THE ASTLEY THEY WERE GIVEN A COUPLE CHANCES BUT KEEPING YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER- KEEP YOUR CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY CURBING YOUR ADDICTION AND THINGS THE LIFE SKILLS THAT YOU ARE. OUT OF THAT WERE HADN'T. CRITICALLY AND TO MAKING IT A BIGGER DANTE AND ARE HOMELESS ISSUE ESPECIALLY WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ADDICTION PROBLEMS AND ALL ABOUT THAT'S WHY I AM VERY HIGH ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT'S PERTINENT THAT THINGS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS IS IN A COMPETITION. THAT THESE PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE TO LIVE AND I EAT I THINK IT'S A VERY POINT IN AND AROUND. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE AT A POINT CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- HERE EVEN IT MIGHT- RAW A- EACH ISSUE WITH HOMELESSNESS- EVERYWHERE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF THE NUMBER IS ACCURATE THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT. PEOPLE CALIFORNIA AT. WILLIAM DOLLARS IMPACT THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP AND THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY TO SPEND LET'S HAVE AS MANY TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AS WE CAN HAVE WE CAN'T ONE SIDE IT'S ALL AND- ALLOW. FOR THE CREATIVITY IN AS YOU MENTIONED THE COUNTIES ARE KIND OF THE ON THE STREET LEVEL DEALING WITH THIS WE MESSAGE CAN IN MY IN MY CORRECT OUT. IT AT BETWEEN AT TWO INCORPORATED CITIES THERE IS ABOUT A MILE STRETCH OF ROAD IT'S UNINCORPORATED. WELL BOTH THE INCORPORATED CITIES HAVE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM PUSH TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION ONTO THIS- UNINCORPORATED. OR PORTION OF THE ROAD AND NOW THEY THE COUNTIES TRYING TO END THE TWO CITIES ARE YOU'RE ALL TRYING TO ARM WRESTLE ON WHOSE PROMISES YOU KNOW IT'S IS PROP IS NOT TO INCORPORATE THESE AND- THE COUNTY OR THE COUNTIES IT'S EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM. AND I THINK IT JUST GOES BACK TO. THIS COMMITTEE ALL OF US JUST LEADERS NEED TO. ALLOW AS MUCH CREATIVITY AS CAN BE BROUGHT TO US TO IMPACT- THIS POPULATION AND HAVE A POSITIVE REASON. FOR A FRUSTRATING. THE THESE THIS HOMELESS POPULATION THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS THESE ARE PEOPLE THESE ARE SOMEBODY'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS SOMEBODY'S BROTHER AND SISTER. SOMEBODY MOP. AT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO OUR ARGUE. OVER DETAILS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO WORK I THINK WE'RE DROPPING THE BALL AND WE'RE COUPLE WILL NOW IN IN OUR MIND THAT TO HAPPEN AND- WE NEED TO ALLOW AS MUCH RESOURCE TAKE. THERE FOR. THANK ON MY HEALTHY TRACK- TO SURVIVE NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT WHATEVER AND I THINK THIS MOVES IN THAT DIRECTION SO THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY. I'M I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKING FOR CLARITY ON THIS ON THE BILL STILL- MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANT TO. TWO ONE SIX WHERE I'M AT ON ON THE SUIT THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING AND IN CENTER JONES JUST DISCUSSING UP. THIS BY WAY OF BACKGROUND FOR A MOMENT. I ALSO COME FROM THE BACKGROUND WORKING ON A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE BIG CITY CITY COUNCIL BEFORE AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE SCHEME. HELLO OR- I'M- OR THOR THINGS SORT OF SORT OF BECOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ALONG THE WAY- I SPREE SUPPORT HOUSING FIRST AS A PER PART OF HOUSING STRATEGY. I'M MY EXPERIENCE IN OUR COUNTY IS WE- THE PASS IN AND I CULTURE THE CAMPAIGN A NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BOND JUST COME UP WITH ENOUGH MONEY. SINCE THAT DEFINITION OF HEALTH. ORDER HOUSING FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME APPLICANTS TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT FORTY HUNDRED UNITS. THE TICKET IN WELL. TO THIS DAY IN IN A THE CAREER I JUST SPOKE OF GOES BACK TWENTY YEARS- WE- BUCKET OF MY- HIS. OF IT THIS PROBLEM IS WHEN I FIRST WITH BILL I THOUGHT WHAT IT WAS TRYING TO DO IS SAY DON'T APPLY FOR PRINT OKAY. WHEN YOU DO THAT YOUR FIRST WITH STAR. THE ABILITY OF GETTING SHELTER BEDS CREATED- BUT IN A POINT INCREASE IN THE THROUGH MY STUFF AND- WHATEVER EXIT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN REPRESENTED TO ME IT'S BEEN REPRESENTATIVES HOUSING FIRST JUST NEEDS TO BE ELIMINATED FROM. CALIFORNIA POLICY IS A STANDARD- IN AND I THINK IT'S- CLOSER JUST. THAT IF IS BECOME. BEGIN THE STRATEGY FOR TRYING TO EXCEL REPURPOSE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHETHER IT'S LIKE IN MY COUNTY OR IN THE BAY AREA SERVICES CANNELLA METERS OR EFFORTS. TO THIS ONE SURE ABSOLUTELY IF YOU HAD. TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND UNITS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY TODAY- THAT WE'RE STUDIO APARTMENTS THAT HAD WRAPAROUND SERVICES. THERE PROBABLY IS A STRATEGY WE CAN GET PEOPLE OUT OF CREEKS AND RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND UNDER OUT FROM UNDER OVERCAST DIRECTLY THIS YEAR TO. BUT WITHOUT FOR THE FORTY TWO HUNDRED. WE'VE TWENTY SIXTEEN TENURE RICIN FOR GOOD REASON YOU DON'T BUILD STUDIO APARTMENTS. R. O. EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY IT'S SO. IN THE INTERIM. OUR SHELTER PROGRAM SIX AND RIPARIAN CORRIDORS AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE THAT ALL YOU DO IS FLY INTO SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. HELLO NINE THE MILLION BAHT PLUS THE CITY ITSELF HASN'T. REALLY YOUR VEHICLE AIRPORT YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL SEE OUR SHELTER PROGRAM IS CALLED THE GUADALUPE. TENCENT TENCENT TENCENT TENCENT TENTS IN IN SO. I THINK. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE HERE IN MY EXPERIENCE TO WORK. THE POLICY TO WHAT'S HAPPENED ON THE EAST COAST FOR EXAMPLE IN IN HAVING TROUBLE TO NEW YORK CITY. THE PERSONALLY VIEW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THERE AND SOME OF THIS IS DEFINITIONAL IT'S DEFINITIONAL TELL YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SHELTER IN NEW YORK CITY IS. STUDIO APARTMENTS OR DORM LIKE FACILITIES THAT'LL HAVE SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE INDIVIDUALS IN IN THEM FOR NINETY DAYS OR HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS UNTIL THE TRANSITION TO PERMIT SUPPORTERS SEEN. THOSE IN NEW YORK FOR YEARS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS THEY'RE IN SHELTER. IN SO. I RESIDENTIAL MINISTRATION GO THE MARCHERS STARTED GET FOLKS OUT OF THESE WAREHOUSE LIKE FACILITIES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN STAYING IN FOR LONGER THAN NINETY- AND WE DO WE NEED EMPHASIZE HOUSING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR BERMAN HOW. PORTION TWENTY BANCSHARES INC AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY NO PURSUIT THE HUD FUNDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR. S. TWELVE. IN I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WAREHOUSE IN SHORT SHELTER WE HAVE PEOPLE OUTSIDE- WE HAVE A WE HAVE ARE HOMELESS OUTSIDE. THERE THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM OF GETTING THE OF. SHELTERS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THERE'S A PROBLEM OF GETTING THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY RIGHT NOW WHILE WE'RE BUILDING. HOUSING WE WERE WAY BEHIND ON IN THIS- BROUGHT TO SOME OTHER TO THIS SO I THINK WE ARE BEHIND I DO THINK THIS CRAP TERMS OF ONE GOES UP IN THE OTHER ONE WENT DOWN. BUT I DON'T GET IT THAT THE- ALSO WHAT I'M CERTAIN ABOUT IT IT DOES IN APPRECIATED CENTER JONES STARRING THE QUESTION OFFICE THIS IS THIS A BOTH AND OR IS IT. YOU KNOW SAYS ASSEMBLY TRYING TO AT LEAST THE WAY THE BILL'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET RID OF. BOTH OF HOUSING FIRST AS A PRINT. IT IN IF IT IS THEN I CAN'T SUPPORTED I WOULD STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY BUT I AM ONE OF YOUR IF AT SOME POINT- THE- OF THE AUTHORS READ BOOKS TO THE- LISTING FOR TO. THE FIRST HERE. YOUR WHICH WILL TAKE HIS THINK USE THAT KERR SAID. I'D LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS- FOR PLAY. SO IT IS NOT. UNTIL THE ROLE PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT OUT THERE. TO HAVE. PROGRAM AND WE NEED WE KNOW THAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR BUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I WANT TO BE IN A FACILITY THAT WILL THAT GOAL. THAT I COULD. MY A LOT OF THE- COURT. CHILDREN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ABUSE OR NEGLECT SOMETIMES IT'S BASICALLY NEGLECT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SERIOUS ADDICTION PROBLEMS THEN YOU'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF YOUR CHILDREN BUT THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME IT'S REALLY APPROVED GEN MORE. THE FLOWER. BUT A LOT STEEP ALL RIGHT NUMBER OF YEARS HERE AND- IN SECOND SO THEY REALLY THE MÀ HERE IF WE NEED TO. A DIFFERENT SORT OF LANGUAGE THERE TO IT OR OFFICE DO- SPEAKER I. THE COMPONENTS OF THE NOTHING WRONG WITH ANYONE OF THESE SIX THE FIRST ONE THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T HAVE MADDIE- REQUIREMENTS IN A HOUSING OF THE XIN YOU'RE PLACING A MOMENT OF LET'S SAY GETTING A VOUCHER FOR YOU CAN. IT GET THE AND THEN. VISIONS SWAPPING LIKE MISS. RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS EXTREMELY- IMPRESSIVE OF THE RECIDIVISM WITH- OVER THE YEARS THERE WERE PEOPLE LINED UP I THINK SHE HAD THREE HAD AWAITING A POINT. RECIDIVISM OF PEOPLE WHO GET HOUSING FIRST AND THEN DON'T KEEP THE HOUSE WHY DON'T BACK ON THE STREET LOSE THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY ARE BACK IN THEIR ADDICTION OR WHATEVER. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT HAVE TO COME HOME. UP LUCIEN AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN MISSING AND I DO BELIEVE CONGRESS IS ABOUT TO SING FOR. WHAT IS BUS YOU'LL HAVE. TO WONDER THE- AND NOT TO DENY THEM A HOUSING FIRST WITHOUT THE PROGRAMMATIC- PROGRAMS THAT ARE THERE BUT NOT TO DENY PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFERING THAT GIVES SOME FUNDING TO EXPAND THAT. TO YOU OUT OF OUR EIGHT- AND I THINK OUR TREATMENTS FOR ESPECIALLY THOSE I THINK I'M THINKING FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR SENATOR KIRSTEN IS THE BECAUSE THOSE ARE. THE SUFFERING LIVE IN THERE INTEL'S CHILLED. THEN THE CHILDREN ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM BECAUSE WITHOUT THE TRY TO GET HIM BACK MEANWHILE ARE THE RISKS THIS FROM IT FAILED BEING REUNITED AND THAT AND FORTH. BEING UNITED AND FOR. EDGE INDIVIDUAL. ABOUT THE FOSTER PARENTS IN A- TRIALED AND GUESTS WOULD HAVE CHILD AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF THEIR SCOTTISH AT SIX EIGHTEEN BECOME IT ADDICT AND THE CHILDREN AHA TWO CHILDREN OUT OF WEDLOCK. MORE IF THE- WE ALL READ TO THAT FULLER US NOT ALLOW THE FOR THAT IS WHAT THE BILL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT IS NOT TO. ENOUGH OF HOUSING TO. OPPORTUNITY TO IN THE- FULL I WOULD TELL YOU I USED TO BE AN END- SUPERVISE AND IT WAS REAL VERY TROUBLING TO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT. DIGITAL'S YOUNG TINA. TWO OR THREE CHILDREN NO PLACE TO GO IN IN THOSE DAYS SO DO HAVE A- HARD FOR THE- I HAVE A PARA. I THEY'RE STILL THAT WE HAVE LOOK AT SO DO CENTONZE BE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE WONDERFUL SESSION WITH SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL TIME IN ENERGY. FIRST ONE IS THE- THAT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT WAS THE BUT HERE WE ARE NOW AND I HAVEN'T HAD A TO SENATOR MITCH I SHOULD PAY HOW DOES NOT. LET'S SEE PUTTING THEIR WE HAVE THESE WERE BOUNCER SAYS. COUNTY PER. ALSO OUT FOR THE KIND OF THE- CORE OF MY- YOU KNOW. MY UP THREE THE POOR. MY CORPORATE LANTERNS THAT LEFT TAKE A LOOK I THINK THERE'S A DEFINITE AND YOU KNOW KEEP THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS DO WE GET CAUGHT UP BECAUSE WE GET MARRIED TO THE ALL WAY AND- WELL. BECAUSE THAT'S CORRECT IS ABOUT ALL REACT TO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH HOUSING FIRST ONLY IN SUMMER GOING TO VERY SUCCESSFUL IF WE HAVE HOUSING. AND ENOUGH THAT. TO ENSURE THAT THE WHAT IT IS- RELATING AND I'M DOUBTS THE OF. THE BEST TIME ALLEN HAPPY TO NOT TAKE A VOTE TODAY TAKE IT BACK AND YOU KNOW WORKS SOME AND TALK TO YOU- CENTRIC COURTESY BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE BEEN THERE AND YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE FROM ABOUT THE GAP THAT MAY BE THE- FIFTH. EIGHT THROUGH THE CHURCH LET ME JUST SAY THAT IS PROBABLY NOT FOR ME TO DO- AND- IT WOULD HAVE TO. YOU KNOW REFER. YOU KNOW A CINNAMON WELL ON MY PART BACK TO THE JUROR IN TERMS OF. OF THIS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE VOTES ON THE COMMITTEE TODAY I AM AT LEAST FOR MY PART I WOULD SAY THIS. IT AGAIN I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO CRITICIZE HOUSING FIRST BILL YEARS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IF BECAUSE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES IN HIM YOU KNOW I'VE AS I SAID IN MY OPINION IS IT'S WORTH INVESTING IN IT'S IN MY COUNTY IT'S NOT BURKE. WITH FISH ISSUE OF DURING. TODAY IS HERE TWO TWO TAKE A BOTH AND I THINK THAT THAT WITH REGARD TO JONES IS COMMENTS WELL WOULD SAY AS A COURTESY TO- FOR MY PART AS TO WHAT I'M CENTER HERE TO DO TO ALLOW THE UPPER. TO AMENDED MADE CLEAR GOING FORWARD- YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD CAST AN AYE VOTE TODAY BUT IT'S ENOUGH NOT TO SEVEN TO A MEAN SPIRITED ALL ABOUT THIS BUT IT THE TO KNOW. WHERE IT IS IN THE- WHAT'S GOING. FOR YOU. NEED TO HOUSING FOR. THE NIGHT AT A- NOBLE- BUT AN ANALYSIS THAT COMES INSTANCE THIS MAY HOUSING ALONE IN A- DIRECTS THE STATE AUGMENT HIS EFFORTS ARE ON A SHORT TERM SHALL IN THE MEAN- I'M ALL THAT SO. OF LEAVE IT AT THAT AND TURN IT BACK OVER THE- OR VERY QUICK RESPONSE I DON'T THINK WE THIS A CAR AND IF OF HOW FOR. TWO HOME LOOK AT A CHART. ARE YOU COULD TAKE THAT AS WITH WHAT WOULD IT SAYING IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT SO VERY VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM. BECAUSE ALL DIVERT BE THAT'S- OUTSIDE THEIR WITH OUR- POPULATION. STATES SO TO. PUT YOU KNOW YOUR CONCERN ON THAT TO REST. THANK YOU AND- THE SURVEY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- YOUR EXPERIENCE AND- AS AS A SOCIAL WORKER HAVING BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES. I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- FOR- COOLEY. HOUSING UP YEAH ACTUALLY. SO YOU HEARD SOME OF THE DISCUSSION GOING ON- AND I KNOW YOU PRESENTED AND- GARCIA WAS POLISHED. BY THE AND TELL YEAH HOUSING FIRST- AND- THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE SOME IMPLICATION THAT UNDER HOUSING FIRST YOU CAN ACTUALLY BEAT STRUCTURE AND- THEN AND SELF. FOR PEOPLE OR THEIR CELL. PERHAPS MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT- WELL FIRST OF ALL TO YOU AND A USER TOUCHED ON THIS BUT- TO WHAT THE- BASED. HOUSING STE AND- ALSO- TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. WHAT WHAT IS AND ISN'T HOUSING FIRST SO BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A SENSE THAT WHILE HOUSING FIRST MEANS WE CAN SIMPLY GIVE SOMEONE AND CAN'T PUT. YES FINAL- IT L. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- THAT ALSO WHEN I. WAS A PROGRAM SUCCESS OR NOT I YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SAY WELL WHAT'S THE BEGINNING POPULATION. CAPTAIN ANYMORE IT'S LIKE WELL ACTUALLY NO YOU GUYS DON'T SEEM POPULATION SO WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE STUCK IN THE STREET BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T KEEP IT WHATEVER DAYS OUT THAT DOESN'T THAT'S A SUCCESS RATE. WHAT YOU'RE A SIX. YOU CAN UPLOAD THE EVIDENCE AND ALSO THE OUTCOMES OF HOUSING FIRST VERSES THE OP YOU KNOWWHAT WE USED TO DO I GUESS- AND THEN- MAYBE TO TALK ABOUT YEAH WELL. AT THE TOP. ME IS THAT RIGHT. WE HAVE PROGRAM THAT SAY LOOKING PROVIDES ITSELF THIS THAT ACTUALLY SOME WE CAN'T IN HOUSING FIRST THE CASE SOME OF THOSE THINGS. I WILL DO MY BEST- I THINK. YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE STATE IS REALLY AND WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS WAS AROUND HAPPEN. SO I BECAME. I'M NOT THEMED. PERIOD OF THE CHART SHOW LISTENERS GO UP LIKE WHAT'S HALF WITH AVERAGE RENTAL COSTS DURING THAT TIME AND WHAT HAPPENED. WAIT IN INCOME DURING THAT TIME IS NOT INCREASING AT THE SAME RATE AS THE INCREASE IN HOUSING. THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE- IN HOMELESSNESS. AND HOUSING HEALTH THAT'S REALLY SORT OF NORTH. IS THAT EVIDENCE SHOWS ACROSS THE- THAT. IN CHRIST THE BEST. A CALL HOUSING COSTS. HOUSING THE PRO CHOICE- OUR STATE DE FUND AGENCY SHELTER. THERE REQUIRE. UNDER SORT OF IN. WITH HOUSING FOR LAW EMERGE SHELTER HAVE FOLLOW LOW BAY. GUY. AND I. CAN IN THE PROGRAM. AT AS WITH WITNESS SPOKE ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE SORT OF WRAP AROUND GOAL SETTING SO YOU ST- THERE CAN BE SUBSTANCE USE TE. FOR PER. AT THAT SOMEONE CAN'T BE KICKED OF THAT HOUSING BECAUSE THEY DON'T PART OR IF THEY REALLY RIGHT RELY THE PART OF RIGHT THREE AND I WHAT IF SOME CAN PROVE THAT. MORE LIKE THE- IF THEY YOU KNOW REMOVED. FOR A FAMILY TO SORT OF SEE THAT THE FOR THEIR RECOVERY FOR THEIR HOUSING OUTCOME DOZEN GET BETTER BIKE OUT OF A PROGRAM IF THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE IN SURVEY. IF THEY ARE- INDICATE USE LAPSED. THE NATIONAL LINE TO END HOMELESS- RATHER THAN SPEAK TO SPECIFIC STUDIES THOUGH I THINK IN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER WE REFER TO A COUPLE OF. UP BUT INVOLVED. IS WHAT FAIL PUTS ABOUT THE STATE THAT SOME THAT FOR MODEL A AGAIN REALLY AT ITS CORE IS HOW IS THE- OF. LAYING OF. COMES OF ALL DIFFERENT THINGS AND- THE FIRST BUT IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT THE ONLY PEACE AND PEOPLE WERE NEEDED TO SERVE ON TOP THAT. GAIL ON THE SCALE ARE STILL IS THAT IMPORTANT FIRST MODEL. AND YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER SIDE- STUDIES THAT DON'T SUPPORT THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AND THE SCALE OF. SO IT'S ON. HOUSING FOR SO THERE'S REALLY EVIDENCE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE SUBSTANCE USERS FOR SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS THE FAMILIES THAT THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL- HAVE BETTER OUT IT. PASSED AROUND. AROUND TYPES. HERBAL LIKE HOW EDUCATION MENTAL ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS- YOU HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN THERE SO THERE'S ANY THAT I CAN BUT I KNOW IT'S ON THAT I. YEAH THE- SO WE HEARD ABOUT HOUSING FIRST PLUS BUT WHAT DOES THE PLUS IT'S A HOT HOT SO I GUESS YOU KNOW- SO IT WAS IMPLIED THAT IF YOU'RE A HOUSING FIRST MODEL YOU CAN'T DO CLASS THERE'S TELL THE FIRST. CLOSE THE ROOM. THANK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN SERVICES- MORE BECAUSE THEY RELAPSE YOU KNOW IDEALLY THERE COULD BE A CHOICE AND IF THERE TRULY WAS A CHOICE BETWEEN A PRO RECORD SOBRE ONE THAT DIDN'T. PERSON RELAPSE THEY WERE IN TWO TO BE PLACED IN ANOTHER HARM REDUCTION MODEL- YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE MAYBE EVAN. A SORT OF HIGH HOUSING FIRST. BUT I THINK AS OF RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW OUR STATE HAS A CONTINUUM OF OPTIONS WE HAVE SHELTERS HAVE SANCTION. YES WE PERMIT PORT OF HOUSING WE HAVE RENTAL SUBSIDY WITH SOME WRAPAROUND. WE REALLY DO HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS BUT THE PRACTICE OF THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE PEOPLE OUT. ONCE THAN IT IT SAID IN. ALL OF SHELTER OR IN HOUSING SHOULD BE SEEKING HELP ME. MS THAT ESSENTIALLY DON'T ADOPT THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY MEANS REMOVING I FROM I UNDERSTAND THIS. THAT REMOVE SOME IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW SO MILLARD YOU CAN START STRUCTURE YOU CAN SAY YOU HAVE CONSERVE IT WOULD PICK ONE CONST ROUTE. RIGHT BASICALLY SYING WE'RE TAKING YOUR DROWNED STREET IT'S- SO- WOULD IN YOUR BILL IF SOMEONE DECIDED TO YOU KNOW WE SAY WELL THERE'S A PROGRAM AND YOU GO IN THERE THAT LEAVES ALL THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY. REMOVE SOLDIERS- REMOVE THEM FROM THAT PROGRAM THEY WOULD HAVE TO FIND THEM ANOTHER SHELTER CAN'T JUST SIMPLY COME OUT ONTO THE STREET RIGHT LIKE OH WELL YOU DO THIS OR- RELATED. OR WHATEVER WE'RE GONNA CHARGE YOU THAT YOU ACTUALLY TO HAVE THE PERSON I MEAN IDEALLY I MEAN THAT THE DIRT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE BASICALLY CHARGE OUT ON TO THE- BUT- STRUCTURE WHATEVER THAT. MIGHT ALERT IF YOU'RE EATING A TAKE SOMEONE IN YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BEING SURE THAT THEY- CONTINUE TO SHELTER INSPECTION. DO YOU END UP REMOVING THE SHELF FROM THE- PHILIP IS THAT SOMETHING. CHOIR FOR HI YES DOCTOR AYE BELIEVE THAT THE PRO THAT ARE STRUCTURE THAT WAY DO YOU HAVE THEIR OWN RULES A- YOU GET ANSWERS SURE YOU KNOW EXACTLY I BELIEVE IT NOW MISTY THANK IN THE IN TOWN. ON THE WAY. OUT OF THE PICTURE. YEAH YOU FELT YOUR THREE TO THE IT'S ARE YOU IS THAT IT'S PROGRAM THEN IF THEY SAY WELL OKAY YOU FEELS THREE SAN WERE GOING TO MOVE FROM OUR PER. IS THAT PROGRAM I'LL TO FIND THEM. IT'S NOT JUST LIKE OH OKAY WE'LL FIND YOU A TEMPORARY BED SOMEWHERE AND THEN NOW WE JUST ABANDON YOU THEIR CELL NUMBERS OR SOME OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO BUT IF YOU'RE NOT TO TAKE A SHOT AT THAT TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE DO THE STATE'S JOB. IT JUST BY THE WATER SO LIVING HOMES AND RESIDENTS TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT'S WHERE ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE WITH ADDICTION IN TREATMENT FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY DID VIOLATE YOU KNOW STAYING SOBER OR NOT YOU KNOW SHOOTING UP OR NOT BRING DRUGS INTO FACILITY THE WORKING ABOUT NEED I THINK DONT. M. AND YET THERE REFER TO THAT OVER AND THERE AT THE ACTUALLY WE CAN YOU THEY ACTUALLY SIGN IN FULL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT VOLUNTEER IT'S A BOB AND IS THE COMMITMENT LETTER HELLO TERRY ENTRANCE AND BECOMING THE PROGRAM AND I THINK IT. I THINK THEY'RE- A BELIEVE- BUT I GUESS THE THAT THE BIGGEST FOR ME. IT WOULD THERE BE AN OBLIGATION FOR THE FUNDING RIGHT SO WHICHEVER YEAH AT YOU COULD BELIEVE THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE TO ASSURE. THE FULL PROGRAM. THAT COULD JUST THIS CHARGE SO OUT INTO THIS YOU KNOW TODAY WOULD HAVE TO. HAVE SOME SORT OF SHELTER THAT FLOW GRAHAM WOULD HAVE TO GO TO BUT YOU CAN'T THOSE DETAILED THEIR DRUG YOU CAN'T JUST SIMPLY OKAY WELL YOU FAILED OUT HERE. YOU WEIRD THAT THAT PROGRAM. ARE IN ANOTHER PLACE FOR THAT PERSON TO LIVE NOT THE STREET OR THE- STRAIGHT IT'S NOT IN THE OFFICE HAD AIR FRANCE ELSE AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY WERE RECEIVING STATE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT OF THE PROGRAM CORRECT. I DON'T JUST. PROGRAMS LIKE THAT I AM HOMELESS LAND HOUSING OF FIRST PLUS AND THEN SOMEHOW THEY DON'T AGREE TO THE CONTRACT THAT THAT KEEP THEY CAME IN. PUBLIC JIM WOOD BE AND HOW.

BUSH IS VERY MUCH IN IT WITH THE- THAT WE'VE HAD. YOU KNOW AS SORT SHORT AS IT'S BEEN. THE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EVEN THE LEGISLATURE IN WHICH IS STANDING UP LAST YEAR'S PROGRAM- ON THE- OF FOSTER IN PREGNANT WOMEN- UPI OR OR GUARANTEED INCOME. IN THAT IN THAT CASE IS BEING ADMINISTERED THROUGH- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THIS. OF THE DISCUSSIONS US FOR. PRODUCTIVE BEEN WITH BOTH OF THE PARCEL SERVICES AND CALIFORNIA PARDON EDUCATION. BT CARD IS BEEN PU OUT THERE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS IT'S LIKELY BECAUSE HE'S OUR WAS MICKEY MANTLE FAMILIES THAT THERE. THERE'S SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THAT- TOOL- BUT IT MAY STILL WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH- WITH CITY ADMINISTRATION TO WERE JUST TRYING TO PUSH THAT OUT. OF THE PIECE THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING I THINK IS CRITICAL- THE BILL. HAS PROVISIONS IN IT. BECAUSE OF. I'M NOT. GOOD FIGHT OF NATION AND IN OTHER WORDS TO MAKE IN KIND CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROGRAM YEAH I THINK THAT WHERE THAT'S IMPORTANT IS IN FINANCIAL LITERACY BUT ALSO WRITTEN. EVEN IN IN MORE CONCRETE AREAS LIKE. SEE THE LEVEL OF WHERE THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM IS FROM PILOTED CREDIT UNIONS FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT NAMING ANYONE SPECIFICALLY- STEPPING UP STEPPING FORWARD AND SAYING YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HELP IN BOTH AREAS BUT TERMS OF FINANCIAL BUT IN IF WITH IF THE PROGRAM MINISTRATIONS GOING TO USE- ELECTRONIC TRAVEL OR OR DEBIT CARD TO MAKE SURE THAT. ALL THE PROTECTIONS. THE CARDS ETCETERA ETCETERA- JUST SORT OF NOWADAYS BUILT INTO TO THOSE INSTRUMENTS SO- ALL THAT IS CRITICAL- AS WE MOVE ALONG WE- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT WE CAN PUT. CORPORATELY PUT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS YOU KNOW IN A IN A LEGISLATIVE BILL HAPPY TO DO THAT- HAPPY YOU KNOW TRYING TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT. HOW THE MONEY'S ACTUALLY USED AS FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL REASONS THAT YOU HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T BE PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF. PATIENT DETAILS OF THE BANKING AND SECURE TRANSACTIONS NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN NOTE THAT SO THE NET TRIPLANE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FUNDS BUT ALSO BECAUSE THIS IS YOU SAID THE TARGET POPULATION OF THE SENIORS WHO HOPEFULLY WE DON'T HAVE A MELT THE GOAT SERRA AND THEN MAYBE EVEN IN MY IN RIGHT SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE INSTRUMENTS NON THEM ITSELF HERE'S AN IF NEEDED WHATEVER BUT ALSO THE TOOL. WHAT MONEY THEY THEM- TRANSIT WHO ARE BETTER OFF THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESSENTIALLY HOPEFULLY ZERO COST BUT YOU KNOW THROUGH. I THINK YOU AGAIN FURTHER ENHANCE. YOUR PROGRAM AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WERE BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE HOPE IS THAT THEY BECOME SCUTTLED ACTUALLY MAKE MORE MONEY RIGHT SO WHAT WE IN THE- AND I COULD. START AND SO FAR THROUGH THE CASE AND SO FORTH THAT THEY CAN DO THAT WILL REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TO DO I KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME DETAILS TO WORK OUT IN. WITH THE GIVE. I DON'T ANY OF ANY QUESTIONS BUT THERE'S A MOTION. ON THIS MEASURE AND JOB. CENTRE QUARTERS HE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE.

THREE MEN SHARE LIKE ALL OF US I THINK AMONG MULTIPLE COMMITTEES TODAY AND- COVERING I'M GETTING ALL MY STEPS IN TODAY I THINK AS A ALL OF US ARE. I TODAY I SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY THREE AND IT WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY THE STATE AND LOCALITIES ON HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM EXPENDITURES AND OUTCOMES THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REPORTS TO CALIFORNIA ENTRY ACCOUNT THE CIVIC INFORMATION. OUR MISSION AS WELL. BUT OUR HOPE IS PRO FOR THE JURORS BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE HOMELESS POPULATION INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED WILL INCLUDE DATA SUCH AS AGE GENDER CRIMINAL JUSTICE HISTORY STATUS OF SHELTER FOR DEATHS OF HOMELESS PERSONS FOSTER YOUTH. HOW THEY TO BE LESS WHAT RESIDED PRIOR TO BEING HOMELESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME OF BEING HOMELESS. FOR EXPENDITURE INFORMATION LOCAL AGENCIES MUST PROVIDE EITHER ONE INFORMATION TO STATE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. THREE STE THE PROVIDING. TO DO BURDEN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INCLUDING AN ESTIMATE FOR HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST FOR THEM TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION. THE COUNCIL COLLECTED INFORMATION THANK AND DATA DRIVEN ASSESSMENT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- NINE BY. FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX. MEMBERS PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION AND I THINK WE EVEN. EARLIER I RECENTLY LAUNCHED HOMES DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM H. T. I. S. WHICH GATHERS INFORMATION ABOUT HOMELESS PERSONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND POSTS ON ITS WEBSITE AS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THE INFORMATION IS STILL LACKING. IN INFORMATION IS LIMITED UNFORTUNATELY PROGRESS IS MAKING IN THE REDUCTION OF THE HOME COPULATE. FROM FROM TO NINETY EIGHT TWENTY WE SITES POINT 8% INCREASE. FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SAW A 7% INCREASE IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION. THIS BILL IS A STEP FURTHER INTO THE DIRECTION THAT OTHER STATES A- YOUR LIVE. IN TEN. HOMELESS DESPITE IN THE- FROM FUNDING SOURCE TRY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS WHICH WILL FOCUS GREATER EFFORTS THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED BY THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF TWO STATE OPS LAST YEAR STATE REPORTS TWENTY TWENTY DASH ONE SIXTEEN FOUND THAT THE STATE DOES NOT REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES THAT DESCRIBE WHETHER ITS ACTIONS WERE LIVING REDUCE THE NOT VIDEO. OUR HOME RIGHT RIGHT THIS QUOTE. TWENTY YEAH WELL.

REIST MEMBERS AUTHOR WILL RECOVER FROM AN INJURY HE X. THAT HE IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO A OR CAN. YOU PUT EFFORTS. RISING FROM COLLECTION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS OFFICES HAD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS WHO OVER THE LAST WEEK SUBMITTED LETTERS OF OPPOSITION WITH ME THIS MORNING BY NEUTRAL I WITNESSED MONIES OF THE SENIOR EDITOR WITH THE STATE- IS OFFICE INCREASE WILL.

ALL OF THE PROVIDERS THAT WORK WITH COMPETING STUFF HERE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY. IN THE- STATE AGENCIES ALSO ADMINISTER MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS AND SERVICES TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

IN MY SYSTEM FOR THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF DATA THE AVI FOR DOUBLE BACK COMPREHENSIVE DATA REGARDING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO OF THAT COURT OVER OFFICE ALSO ISSUED ANOTHER REPORT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN THAT REPORT WE SPECIFICALLY RAISED THE CONCERN THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HAVE NOT COLLECTED IN. OR RECORDED DATA USING OUTCOME MEASURES FOR ANY OF ITS HOMELESS PROGRAMS. WE BELIEVE THAT MEASURING OUTCOMES IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW WELL THE STATE SPENDING.

PAN AND JUST TO RESPOND BRIEFLY- OUR SERVER OF SUCH LITERATURE IS HERE- TAKING NOTES IN AND FOR THE SENATE CENTERS ACTUALLY ON HIS WAY UP TO SACRAMENTO IN A WEEK- HE IS. I THINK ACTUALLY I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE COPS- I WOULDN'T EVEN CALL IT OPPOSITION AT THIS POINT TIME IT'S LIKE- THE AUTHOR AND THE AND THE- INTEREST SIR. ARE HAVING A POSITIVE DIALOGUE- IT IS I CENTER WILTED WHAT MANAGED TO SHARE THAT HE IS CONTINUING TO WORK HE REALIZES THERE'S ROBOT. AB AND THERE ARE LOTS OF IT- AT WEARING IN THERE TERREL TAILORED TOWARDS THE AUDITORS- CONCERNS. SENATE QUARTERS THANK YOU YEAH I JUST I WANNA SURE CONCERNED ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW THE QUANTITY THE BREATH AND THE DETAILED INFORMATION THE IT'S AGAIN A LITTLE IRONIC FOR ME TO SAY THAT- BASE A MILE CAL ME EXPERIENCED THIS IN OUR COUNTY. THE BIG MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE JUST READ ATTACK. ACTUALLY TEAM TO DO A COST STUDY IN THE GENERATE ALL THIS INFORMATION IF YOU WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN MAIL IT IN TO EVERY OFFICE IN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S NOT HARD ONCE YOU HAVE IT I'M SURE I ALSO LOSE ALL TWENTY COLLEGES. TO GET. WELL IT WILL YOU KNOW COME UP WITH BILL IS ASKING REALLY INTO. AND EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THIS INFORMATION COUNTY BY COUNTY WHAT COUNTY BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE COUNTY SAID JUST SIMPLY COULDN'T AFFORD. IT TO PULL THAT OFF AND THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES. THE HAVE SORT OF DISPARATE INFORMATION. WHAT HAPPENS THEN SO. THAT MEANS WORK- IN THE A PHARMACY BE A HUGE APPROPRIATIONS ISSUE TO ASK THE STATE TO PAY FOR. THOSE KIND OF INDEPENDENT STUDIES OF PF COUNTY SO. I THINK. THERE'S PROBABLY INFORMATION EACH AND EVERY COUNTY ALREADY HOUSE. I WOULDN'T CREE A BIGGER CORPORATION PROBLEMS TO JUST SAY YOU NEED TO THE FINAL THAT INFORMATION UP HERE YOU KNOW FAIR KEEPING IT IN FIFTY EIGHT SILOS WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AS WAS LOOK MORE SUPPORTABLE BILL LATER ON TO THE ROAD BUT- HEARING THAT FOLKS ARE TRYING TO WORK. IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT ALSO. OKAY TODAY- BUT WITH A COPY OF THAT. I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HELP THOSE RESERVATIONS LATER SURE AND I THINK YOU CAN. GET ON THE ONE OF THE POINTS A DOCTOR CAN MEET AS WELL AS- YOUR THE POINT TIME COUNT. YOU KNOW MOST OF COUNTIES ARE PARTICIPATING THAT THAT INFORMATION CERTAINLY SHOULD BE AVAILABLE THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW CERTAINLY MOVE UP TO THE STATE THIS POINT TIME. THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT ITERATION- DOES ACCOUNT FOR- WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT- ORDERS JURISDICTIONS AND JUST SAY THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT- THIS STATE OF AND THEN SEND THE STATE AN- ESTIMATE OF WHY YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST THEM TO DO IT. AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW CAN STATE HELP SO- WERE MOVED ACT AS IF THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE. AND THE- AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO. ACTION THAT- DRESSES OF CANCER. IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHURCH'S SAY AND NOT GET PARTISAN AT ALL BUT IT WAS- I WAS ON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT HAD. OR DO. I'M A REPUBLICAN MEMBER THE PURSUE THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE COST BENEFIT WOULD BE A PUTTING PEOPLE PERMITS FOR HOUSING SO THE COSTS THAT HE CAME BACK INTO THIS COST YOU EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS ALL THESE THINGS LISTED IN THIS BILL A RISK ASSESSMENT IN.

THOUGHT ABOUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO FEEL RANDOM BUT BUMBLE MOVE THE BILL'S ACCOUNT WORK ON WE HAVE A MOTION CONSULTED YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS THE PAST BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS HURTADO AYE HURTADO AYE JONES HI JONES I CRITICALLY CRITICIZED HIM FIVE AND- GALLAGHER. VOTERS FOUR ZERO THE VOTE WAS FOUR ZERO NOT BILL IS OUT. SHE RECALED TO. WE HAVE- WITH BOTH OTHERS. WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE UP NEXT WE HAVE AGENDA ITEM THIRTEEN I THINK IT SIMPLE CHOIR YOUR FAULT OF THE PRESENT BELIEVE THIS BILL HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SO. WITH BETTER CHAIRED MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OR MAKE AT THE STATEMENT BRIEF AND WE DO HAVE A TWO WITNESSES WHO WERE ON THE LINE AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND HARD WORK ON THE HEALTH BOTTOM LINE IS THIS AT. FOURTEEN THIRTY IT'S CRITICAL IT SPAIN SUFFICIENT BENEFITS FOR NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN HOW FRESH SOLELY BECAUSE THEY ALREADY UTILIZED A USDA FOOD PROGRAM. EXCLUDE SENATE CONFIRMED. THE FOOD DIVISION PROGRAM ON RESIDENTS- BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IF I AM NOT HAPPY IF I'M A SNAP CAL FRESH RECIPIENT. ON A MONTHLY BASIS I AM RECEIVING RECEIVING A PROXY HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS TWENTY EIGHT CENTS OF. IF I AM ON THE AT FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS ALSO KNOWN AS FDPIR I'M RECEIVING ABOUT NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS A MONTH THREE DOLLARS EVERY MONTH WHICH IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IF YOU'RE LIVING IN POVERTY. WHAT WE KNOW IS THERE ONE IN THREE. FAMILIES ACROSS THE NOT BELOW THE POVERTY LINE THE KLAMATH RIVER BASIN AT WHICH IS UP ON THE NORTH COAST SURVEY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES 92% 92% OF ALL TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE. IN A REGION WHERE FOOD IS SCARCE IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD. SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW IT AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO ARE RECEIVING FDPIR TO ALSO RECEIVE THE DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE PASS THIS THIS WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR SO MANY NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES TODAY WE HAVE A PLAYER- CRUISER WITH US TODAY IS POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COVER TRAVEL FAMILIES COALITION. ALSO GRATEFUL THAT WE THURMOND JOE JANES IN THE YUROK TRIBE WITH THIS TODAY I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR HELP AND I DON'T. I PLEASED. WE HAVE A WITH EARLY WITNESS NUMBER ONE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CLEAR CRUISER I'M A MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF VALLEY TRIED AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA TRIBAL. COALITION THE CALIFORNIA TRIBAL FAMILIES COALITION IS ATTRACTIVELY LED MEMBERSHIP ORGANISATION FOCUSED ON SYSTEMIC CHANGE TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF TRIBAL CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHICH ARE INHERENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS AND ARE AT THE CORE OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. OUR COALITION REPRESENTS NEARLY HALF OF ALL ONE HUNDRED AND NINE TRIBAL NATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. A TESTAMENT TO JUST HOW IMPORTANT TRIED SPEAK ISSUES CONCERNING OUR NEXT GENERATION. FOR THE PAST DECADE I HAVE WORKED WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN TRIBAL SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF A TRIBALLY RUN FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM ON INDIAN RESERVATIONS. I AM ON INDIAN. AS THE- FUNDED USDA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PROVIDING PRE PACKAGED FOOD BOXES TO INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON OR NEAR RESERVATIONS AND ADMINISTERED BY EITHER TRY INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS OR AGENCIES IN STATE GOVERNMENT. DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS PROVIDE IMPORTANT BENEFITS. INCLUDING EASIER ACCESS TO FOOD IN AREAS WHERE GROCERY STORES ARE LACKING IN TRANSPORTATION TO THOSE STORES ONE AVAILABLE. IN MY EXPERIENCE FAMILIES OFTEN FACE DIFFICULT CHOICES AND MUST NAVIGATE COMPLEX ELIGIBILITY STRUCTURES TO GAIN ACCESS TO NEEDED ASSISTANCE. IT'S DIFFICULTY I HAVE IN FAMILIES FACE IS WHETHER OR NOT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM A FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM OR TO RECEIVE CALFRESH BENEFITS BECAUSE BOTH ARE NOT AN OPTION. FAMILIES WILL OFTEN OPT TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM BECAUSE THE FOOD IS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THEM. BY INDIVIDUAL THING- FROM THE COMMUNITY. YET THIS DIFFICULT DECISION HAVE GREAT IMPACT ON CAMPUS. PROVIDED BY FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS ANNOUNCED TO APPROXIMATELY TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTY CENTS LESS PER DAY COMPARED TO THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS RECEIVING CALFRESH. SB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN SPEAKS THE REMEDY THAT AND EQUITY IN ASSISTANCE FOR TRIBAL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN AN AMOUNT THAT WOULD MAKE THE TOTAL BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND THE FAT PROGRAM ECLIPSE AND THOSE. RECEIVING CALFRESH ASSISTANT. FILLING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SMALL GAP IN SERVICES WILLHAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON TRIBAL CHILDREN FAMILIES AND ELDER TO FACE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF POVERTY. AND FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS THE STATE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE COALITION SUPPORT SB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN AND AFTER THAT THE COMMITTEE DO THE SAME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU I'M THIS.
