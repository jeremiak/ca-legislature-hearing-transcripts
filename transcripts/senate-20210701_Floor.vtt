00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.250
COUNTY TOOK A DIFFERENT PATH

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:45.951
AND WE HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.819
COUNTIES. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.488
THAT I REPRESENTS WITHIN FIRST

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:52.190
THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.860
LAW BEING PASSED. WAS ABLE TO

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.995
APPROVE EIGHT HUNDRED DIFFERENT

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.096
LICENSES IN THE FIRST FOUR

00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.731
MONTHS- AND THAT IS HOW WE

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.166
ENDED UP BEING A COUNTY THAT

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.235
HAD SO MANY OF THE LICENSES.

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:06.038
AND ON THIS FLOOR IN THIS BODY

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.806
HAS TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT THE

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.875
IMPORTANCE. OF ALLOWING FOR

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:12.544
SMALL GROWERS SMALL CULTIVATORS

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.113
AT TO HAVE A STAKE IN THE GAME-

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.016
TO ENSURE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.685
ONE THAT SUPPORTS ALSO. UNDER

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:21.086
REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.654
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.423
REALITY IS THAT FOUR YEARS

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.525
LATER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.126
WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR DISTRICT

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.194
AND I THINK THAT THIS TRAILER

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.495
BILL ADDRESSES IT IT'S

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.131
SOMETHING- RELATED TO STACKED

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:37.202
LICENSES. BUT CONCEPT THAT MANY

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.572
BIG GROWERS HAVE MULTIPLE SMALL

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:44.543
LICENSES- IN ORDER TO GET NINE

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.712
HUNDRED ACRES A HUNDRED AND

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:47.446
SEVETY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:50.215
SEVEN ACRES NINETY ACRES BIG.

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:53.085
ACREAGE FOR THEM NOW THE BALLOT

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.686
INITIATIVE TO TRY TO PREVENT

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:56.421
THIS TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:20:56.488 --> 00:20:57.823
WOULD HAVE SOME OF THE SMALL

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:59.891
GROWERS BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.727
AND SO FOR THESE REASONS AT

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:03.328
THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL AS

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:04.563
IT RELATES TO THE SMALL

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.065
LICENSES- AND IN THE STACKED

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:08.767
LICENSES SPECIFICALLY PUTS A

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.870
LIMIT ON THIS WE HAD FOR YEARS-

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.105
FOR FOLKS TO COMPLETE THE

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.272
PROCESS BOTH AT THE LOCAL

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.174
JURISDICTION. AND AT THE STATE

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.543
LEVEL AND THE COULD THE IDEA

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.512
WAS NEVER THAT BIG COMPANIES

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.648
WOULD SWEEP UP THE LITTLE ONES

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:24.850
IT WAS NEVER THAT IDEA BUT THE

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.818
REALITY AND THE DATA SHOW THAT

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.787
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING- WHICH

00:21:28.854 --> 00:21:30.589
COULD COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.124
BEEN VERY GENEROUS FOR WE HAVE

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.358
TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:36.094
IMPLEMENT THE LAW AND SO I WANT

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.095
TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE I

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:37.963
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.232
DISCUSSION AND I THINK THAT NOW

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.133
THIS BODY HAS A DIFFERENT

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.568
DILEMMA. THE DILEMMA OF NOT

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:44.569
JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WE

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:48.607
MOVE. FROM THE UNLICENSED- E.

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:50.542
NO COMMUNITY TO GET THEM TO BE

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.144
LICENSE BUT ALSO HOW WE DO

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.880
RIGHT FOR ALL LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.015
IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:59.651
IDEA BEHIND. THIS BALLOT

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.153
INITIATIVE TO ALLOW A

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:03.455
COMPETITIVE FIELD AMONG ALL

00:22:03.522 --> 00:22:07.025
PRODUCERS GROWERS- THE- EASE IS

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.493
ACTIVE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.828
WHAT WE'RE SEEN SO I KNOW THAT

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:10.729
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:22:10.796 --> 00:22:11.930
DISCUSSION IN THIS BODY AND I

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.131
WANTED TO THE SPECIFICALLY

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:15.701
RAISES. BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.135
THAT HAPPENED IN ONE COUNTY ARE

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.237
NOT THE SAME- IN OTHER COUNTIES

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.073
SO WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:22.774
FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES-

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:25.343
WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:26.011
DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD. ABOUT

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:28.380
HOW WE ENSURE- THE BALANCE

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:29.548
BETWEEN THE COUNTIES THAT WE

00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:31.049
DON'T WANT TO PROVE ANYTHING

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.251
BUT ALSO THE COUNTIES- WHO HAVE

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:35.220
BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY GENEROUS AND

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:37.022
ARE NOW SEEN THAT THE SPIRIT OF

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:39.424
THE VOTERS- IS IN JEOPARDY.

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.626
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:44.262
HOW TO GO AROUND SOME OF THE

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.397
PROCESS SEASON I WANT TO SAY

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.798
THAT AS IT RELATES TO SEEK

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:48.300
WELL. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.635
DECIDED TO DO- A PROGRAMMATIC

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:52.938
ER BECAUSE IT'S FASTER

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:55.107
IT WOULDN'T BE THAT PLACE AND

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.042
EVEN WITH THOSE. ELEMENTS IN

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:58.443
PLACE OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.945
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS FASTER

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:02.214
WE'VE HAD THESE CHALLENGES SO I

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.115
WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.016
THAT WITH FOLKS- AND ENCOURAGED

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:07.052
AS DISCUSSIONS MOVE FORWARD. WE

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:09.421
TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.389
THAT ALL KEY FIFTY EIGHT

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:13.725
COUNTIES- WE DEAL WITH IT I

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.626
THINK THE UNINTENDED

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.428
REPERCUSSIONS. OF THE BALLOT

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.730
INITIATIVE. FOR FIFTY DIFFERENT

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:19.664
COUNTIES WHICH I KNOW IS VERY

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.568
DIFFICULT SO- WITH THAT TIME I

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:24.536
WILL BE SUPPORTING AT THIS.

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:26.772
PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL AND I

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.272
LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:31.576

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.119
SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:42.487
FROM THE LAST SPEAKER I'M THE

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.456
ONLY FARMER I BELIEVE LIKE. ON

SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:11.683
HERE I THINK WE SHOULD SLOW

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.385
DOWN AND WE SHOULD DO THIS TRY

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:14.186
TO DO THIS RIGHT IS NOT GOING

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:17.556
TO BE PERFECT. ANYWAY I HAVE.

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.924

POSSIBLY DEAL WITH THE ILLEGAL

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:40.846
GROWS THAT ARE HAPPENING SO

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.047
THEY'RE COMPETING AGAINST THOSE

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.049
LEGAL GROWS. THAT YOU HAVE IN

00:24:44.115 --> 00:24:46.051

FARMER YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAY IN

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.291
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ALL THE

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:54.926
REGULATORY LAWS THAT ARE

00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:58.029
PASSED. IN THIS BODY SO FOR ME

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.030

REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WE SET

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.546
UP. HE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.615
ILLEGAL PRODUCT THAT'S COMING

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.617
ALL OVER CALIFORNIA SO. I'M

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:20.051
GONNA LAY OFF AYE I SUGGEST

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:21.786

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.255
TO HURRY ON THIS WE NEED TO.

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.090

THE DETAILS AND LOOK YES T'S

00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:34.399
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE OF PROP

00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:35.500
SIXTY FOUR IS NOT EASY AND

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:36.701
YOU'RE RIGHT. EVERY COUNTY DOES

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:38.103
SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT UTIL

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:39.938

NEVER GONNA GET THERE AND THESE

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.975
LEGAL PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GIVE

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.543
UP. THE CENTER FROM THE NORTH

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.478
COAST BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.013
GREAT POINTS AND TRUST ME.

TRYING TO BECOME LEGAL AND DO

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:59.624
IT IN A REGULATED MARKET INTEL

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:01.126
WE SLOW DOWN AND DO IT RIGHT

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:01.726
WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH THE

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:03.261
SAME EXACT THING AND WE'RE NOT
