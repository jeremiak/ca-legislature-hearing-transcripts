ABOUT FOUR YEARS.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.734
SO FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.869
WHEN YOU ADD UP AND YOU LOOK AT

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.905

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.748
BEING ADDED TO OUR ECONOMY.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.917
EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S MORE THAN

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:26.952
WHAT IS IN MEDI CAL IN TERMS OF

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.756
ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THE CAREGIVER.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:32.725
SO WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU FACE

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:33.359
SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY MENTION

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.094
IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW FROM YOUR

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.962
OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.864
THAT THERE ARE HEALTH IMPACTS

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.766
FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.735
OF WHERE WE CAN THEY GET

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.837
MUSCULAR DISEASE THAT IS THEY

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.805
HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS ONE

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:49.174
OF THE OF PREVAILING THINGS THAT

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:52.745
WE SEE A LOT IS DEPRESSION AMONG

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:53.112
OUR CAREGIVERS.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.813
CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND HIGH

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.849
SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION WHICH

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.951
REALLY LOWERS YOUR ENERGY AND

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:00.786
THINKING ABILITY.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.654
I ALSO HAVE A IN SOME

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:03.255
POPULATIONS RESEARCHES EVEN

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.990
POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S A

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.859
HIGHER MORTALITY RATE FOR FAMILY

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.827
CAREGIVERS ARE CARING FOR

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:09.328
SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.796
PARTICULARLY MALE CARE GIVERS.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:14.666
THE FISCAL IMPACT OF CAREGIVING

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:16.668
IS THERE IS A HIGH OUT OF POCKET

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.971
COST IN GENERAL AND THAT'S WHERE

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.806
THINGS THAT ARE NOT COVERED.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.741
BY OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES WE

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.676
HAVE A LOT OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS

00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:25.043
ON EMPLOYMENT.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.680
OF THE SIDES ABSENTEEISM WE HAVE

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:29.348
A LOT OF PRESS ANTI ISM SO FOR

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:32.684
OUR EMPLOYERS THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:35.120
FOURTH THAT SOMETIMES IS THERE

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:38.724
BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS PRESENT.

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:39.324
WE ALSO HAVE REDUCE SAVINGS

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.726
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.694
UP FOR ALL OF THE CAREGIVERS

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:44.763
THAT ARE THERE SO THAT IN THE

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.397
LONG RUN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.132
THE IMPACT DOWN THE LINE ON

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.268
THEIR OWN RETIREMENT ABILITIES.

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.236
AND WE HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF

00:17:51.303 --> 00:17:53.205
POVERTY BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.973
CARE GIVER MIGHT --

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.975
BE LIVING WITH THE OLDER ADULT

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.144
ARE WITH THE FAMILY RELATIVE AND

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.846
THEN WHEN THE RELATIVE PASSES

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.015
AWAY AND THEY DON'T HAVE

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:03.649
ANYWHERE TO GO AND THEY CAN END

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:05.017
UP EVEN HOMELESS.

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:05.684
AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT WITH THEIR

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:06.919
CAREGIVERS [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.754
SO.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.354
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.724
ABOUT WHAT WE DID OVER THE LAST

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:14.927
TWO YEARS BESIDES EAT VERY GOOD

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.762
LUNCHES AND HER.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:20.766
ALMOST WITH XENA YEAH.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.801
AND THERE'S A LOT WE ALSO HAD WE

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:23.435
ACTUALLY HAD A PROCESS OF DOING

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:24.870
THINGS.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:25.437
I WAS SO WE STARTED WITH

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:28.740
PRIORITY AREAS THAT WHERE I AM

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.642
PRESENTED IN OUR INTERIM REPORT

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.878
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SO WHAT

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:33.445
WE DID IS WE LOOKED AT AN

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:34.680
INTEGRATED APPROACH.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.782
TO CARE MANAGEMENT.

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.750
AND WE REVIEWED INFORMATION

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.786
ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY A

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.921
CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THERE ARE

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:43.355
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.023
WE'D LOOK AT CARE GIVER

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.760
COMPENSATION IN THAT REPORT AND

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.963
THE DATA ON OUR CARE GIVERS AND

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.530
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.998
ALONG WITH EDUCATION AND

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.000
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS TO

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:56.702
SERVICES.

00:18:56.768 --> 00:18:59.037
SO OUR FIRST REPORT REALLY

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.839
TRIBUTE OF VERY GOOD INVENTORY

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:03.008
AND TRY TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:04.776
KIND OF WHAT COULD WE DO TOWARDS

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.678
DEVELOPING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.714
WE REVIEWED ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.682
WE'VE THEN I'M USED A VERY

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:11.283
RESEARCH DRIVEN BECAUSE GUESS

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.018
WHAT WE'RE IN A RESEARCH

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.720
INSTITUTION.

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:16.955
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY WE REALLY

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.957
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THINGS BY

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.959
DOING SURVEYS LOOKING AT THE

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.995
RESEARCH AND SO WE DID A REAL

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:24.796
COMPILATION OF WHAT OTHER STATE

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:25.097
TASK FORCE.

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.032
THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.934
OF WHAT THEY ARE AND THERE'S A

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.836
WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GO AND SEE

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:33.038
WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.973
DOING IN TERMS OF TASK FORCE WE

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.009
DID A SURVEY OF AGENCIES IN

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.744
CALIFORNIA.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.411
FINDING OUT HOW THEY ARE WORKING

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.779
WITH --

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.081
CURRENTLY WITH CAREGIVERS AND

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.950
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.785
PRACTICES THAT ARE SUGGESTED AND

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.820
WE DID LOOK AT THE BEST

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.354
PRACTICES AND POLICIES.

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:52.791
THERE ARE WITHIN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:53.425
ALSO ACROSS THE NATION SO THAT

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.260
WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:57.229
DO WE WANT TO INNOVATE HERE IN

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.997
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.766
GENERALLY THE INNOVATIVE STATE.

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.768
AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE.

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:04.770
SO.

00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.905
THE VALUES AND THIS IS SOMETHING

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.740
THAT -- WE

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:10.809
FELT THAT THIS IS AS WE DID OUR

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.480
RECOMMENDATIONS SO EVEN IF YOU

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.082
DON'T HEAR THESE WORDS.

THESE ARE ALWAYS PART OF OUR

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:20.986
UNDERSTANDING IN VALUES THAT WE

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.021
FEEL SHOULD BE PART OF ANY

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:25.057

LEGISLATION TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.924
THERE HAS TO BE A WORK LIFE

00:20:58.991 --> 00:20:59.491
BALANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:00.792
AVERAGE AGE.

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.894
THESE ARE STILL WORKING AND

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:05.263
PEOPLE AND SO THE CAREGIVERS ARE

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:06.898
GENERALLY WORKING AT BUT YOU

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:07.466
HAVE TO HAVE THAT WORK LIFE

AND WE WANT CHOICE AND OPTIONS

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.804
FOR CAREGIVERS CARE GIVER DOWN

IS SOMETHING THAT SOMETIMES

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.107
YOU'RE.

GENERALLY IT COMES FROM THE

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.881
HEART BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE

00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:24.750
THE OPTION OF SAYING.

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:28.754
MAYBE I'M NOT THE BEST PERSON.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.756
TO SO.

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:32.724
GIVEN THOSE ARE I USE THAT WE

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:33.358
WANT TO HAVE ACROSS ALL OF THE

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.926
RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLEASE

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:35.427
REMEMBER THIS FOR FUTURE

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.762
LEGISLATION.

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:39.097
OF I'M GONNA GO OVER SOME OF THE

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:40.866
RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE FIRST

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:42.934
RECOMMENDATION AT THEIR NOT IN

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.770
ANY PARTICULAR ORDER.

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:47.172
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT AND HIS

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:50.742
OLDEST CFO'S IF IT PLEASE DON'T

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.410
TAKE THIS LIKE ALL THAT'S NUMBER.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.844
ONE OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT IN ANY

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.880
ORDER BUT OUR FIRST THING WAS TO

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:55.347
LOOK AT OF OUR FIRST

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:57.015
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TASK

00:21:57.082 --> 00:21:58.817
FORCE CAME OUT TO SUPPORT THE

00:21:58.884 --> 00:21:59.317
FINANCIAL WELL BEING.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.786
OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:04.756
AND LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:05.323
THIS ROLE CONTRIBUTES TO AN

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.794
INCREASED RISK OF POVERTY.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.294
AND LONG TERM FINANCIAL

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.696
INSECURITY.

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.998
SO HOW MIGHT YOU GO ABOUT DOING

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.766
THAT IS A LEGISLATOR

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:15.067
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:17.135
WELL. ONE THING WE FELT AND I

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.171
APOLOGIZE FOR THE LITTLE PICTURE

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.806
ON THE SIDE OF THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:22:20.872 --> 00:22:23.208
A YES VOTE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.110
THAT'S FUZZY BUT YOU HAVE THIS

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:25.477
IN YOUR PACKET.

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:27.045
IS JUST FOR COLOR [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:30.716
BOB.

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:33.018
SO HOW CAN YOU GO ABOUT ME OF

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:34.853
MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION TO

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.888
REALITY WE HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.857
WOULD BE A TAX CREDIT. FOR THE

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.026
HIGH OUT OF POCKET COST OF CARE

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:43.128
GIVERS IN SO SOME WAY LOOKING AT

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:43.328
THAT.

00:22:43.395 --> 00:22:45.163
PERHAPS IT COULD BE A STIPEND OR

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.700
SIMILAR PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CARE

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:50.702
GIVERS WITH THE COST OF

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:52.738
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES.

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:55.006
AND THIRDLY AND THEIR MANY MORE

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:56.875
THEY CAN GO FOR BUT THESE ARE

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:57.275
LIKE OUR TOP THREE

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:58.744
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.946
AND BUILD ON OUR FAMILY MEDICAL

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:03.048
LEAVE ACT AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:05.117
LAWS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

00:23:05.183 --> 00:23:07.052
CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN REALLY

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.754
AND ONE WAY IS JUST.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.822
VERY SIMPLY WORKING WITH

00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:11.423
INCREASING AWARENESS OF THESE

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.860
EXISTING PROGRAMS OF AND SO

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:15.093
CLOSER.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.028
OUR FIRST LETTERS OF

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.930
RECOMMENDATIONS NOW SOME OF THE

00:23:18.997 --> 00:23:20.899
THINGS PARTICULARLY FOR THIS

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:23.068
LAST OF THE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:24.770
LAWS WE JUST WANT TO POINT OUT.

00:23:24.836 --> 00:23:27.205
THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:28.907
THE CURRENT LEAVE LAWS WHERE WE

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.909
HAVE ABOUT 40% OF WORKERS WHO

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.211
ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR LEAVE LAW

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:35.080
SO WE CAN LOOK AT THAT

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.782
LEGISLATIVELY.

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:37.449
AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:40.752
VERY HIGH LACK OF AWARENESS

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.721
AMONG HR PROFESSIONALS AND

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:43.021
EMPLOYERS.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.257
ABOUT THE LEAVE LAWS SO THAT WE

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:48.794
HAVE A ONLY ABOUT 10% OF THE

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.096
CURRENT CLAIMS ARE BEING USED BY

00:23:51.163 --> 00:23:53.031
PAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHERE THE

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:55.267
BULK OF THE CLAIMS FOR OF PAID

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.902
FAMILY LEAVE.

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:58.703
ARE AROUND MATERNITY LEAVE.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.206
AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR MORE CARE

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:02.974
GIVERS AND THAT 10% REFLECTS WHO

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.810
ARE WORKING.

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:06.945
THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:08.747
TASK FORCE IS TO MODERNIZE AND

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:10.882
STANDARDIZE CARE GIVER

00:24:10.949 --> 00:24:12.751
ASSESSMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. TO

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.820
SUPPORT INDIVIDUALIZATION OF

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.721
SERVICES.

00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.857
REDUCE SERVICE FRAGMENTATION AND

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.859
INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF WHO AMONG

00:24:20.926 --> 00:24:22.727
CARE GIVERS.

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.763
I IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USE

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.230
OUR SKIRTS SERVICES.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:28.700
SO WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION WHAT

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.802
WE REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE

00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:32.704
IS THAT THAT INDIVIDUALIZATION

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:34.773
BECAUSE IF YOU'VE MET ONE

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.340
CAREGIVER YOU HAVE MET ONE

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:36.741
CAREGIVER.

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.910
AND SO YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:39.511
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:40.779
THAT.

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:43.114
HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT THIS

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:45.083
LEGISLATIVELY WELL SOME OF THE

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.118
SUGGESTIONS WE WOULD MAKE WOULD

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:49.020
BE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:50.689
STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT?

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.891
TO OF THEY COULD BE USED ACROSS

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.826
THE STATE INCREASED FUNDING FOR

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.862
ANY TYPE OF CARE GIVER

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:58.830
ASSESSMENT USUALLY THE

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.832
ASSESSMENT PIECE MAY NOT EVEN BE

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:01.299
PAID FOR WITH THE END.

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.801
OF A SYSTEM.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.669
WE COULD COLLECT REPRESENTATIVE

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.038
SURVEY DATA ON CARE GIVERS IN

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:08.807
CALIFORNIA.

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.775
AND WE CAN REMOVE BARRIERS

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.944
ACROSS AGENCIES THAT INHIBITS

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:15.080
SAFE RETURN OF PEOPLE WITH AN

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.048
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY OR

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:18.783
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT WHICH

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.919
ALLOWS THE CARE GIVER THE KID

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:22.721
THEY FAMILY.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.689
TO FIND THAT PERSON AND AND

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.825
CONTINUE THEIR CARE EASIER.

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:28.793
THE LAST RECOMMENDATION THAT

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.862
I'LL BE ON PRESENTING AND THEN

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:32.697
I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SANDY.

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:34.833
IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE WE FEEL

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.735
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:38.937
CREATE A STATEWIDE ADVISORY

00:25:39.004 --> 00:25:40.839
COUNCIL.

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:41.406
ON MATTERS AFFECTING FAMILY

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:42.741
CAREGIVERS.

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.876
THAT PROVIDES ADVICE ON

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:46.845
INTEGRATING CAREGIVER ISSUES

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:47.245
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:50.749
DEPARTMENT'S SERVICES.

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:53.118
INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS AND

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.020
PROVIDE POLICY EXPERTISE TO THE

00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:56.755
LEGISLATOR.

00:25:56.821 --> 00:26:00.926
SO I LEGISLATION SO THAT MONEY

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:01.092
IS.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.729
AS THEIR WAY FOR US TO CONTINUE

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.765
TO HAVE A REAL FOCUS.

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.034
ON CAREGIVING IN THE STATE OF

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.902
CALIFORNIA WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.938
HAVE THAT PASSION AND DEDICATION

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:15.006
AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL ON EVEN

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.775
WITH AN AGENCY.

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:19.144
AND THE OTHER THING I DID WANT

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.112
TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHAT WE DO

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:22.781
WILL BE ANTICIPATING.

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:24.749
IS THAT WE WILL BE PUTTING

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:25.050
TOGETHER --

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.985
WE'VE DECIDED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.887
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE USUALLY

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:29.487
FINISHED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:30.956
LITTLE MORE TIME.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.891
AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:33.358
BE PUTTING TOGETHER A

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.793
LEGISLATIVE PACKET.

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.895
WITH ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.830
LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES THAT WE

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:40.799
WILL INTRODUCE TO THE

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.934
LEGISLATION THIS FALL AFTER OUR

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:44.703
STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION.

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:46.905

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:01.079
DIAGNOSIS THAT A PERSON MAY HAVE

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.914
THAT REQUIRES THEM TO USE A

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.214

THOUSAND NINE LEVEL.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.287
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER SIX

00:35:23.354 --> 00:35:25.223
INCREASE FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA'S

EXPAND RESPITE CARE VIA

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:49.413
RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE EARLIER.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.182
PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED EDUCATION

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:52.817

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.819
SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF

INNOVATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE

00:35:55.486 --> 00:36:00.791
PROGRAMS.

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:03.060
AS I WIND UP AND WE COMPLETE THE

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:04.996
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S A GOOD

00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:06.697
LAUNDRY LIST.

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.933

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:49.000
EVERYONE WHO TAKES ON THE

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.868
CAREGIVING ROLE DOES IT OUT OF

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.837
LOVE MOST PEOPLE DO IT OUT OF

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:54.672
LOVE ADAM AND THEY WANT THE BEST

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:58.676
CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER --

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.778
AND THIS CUTS ACROSS ALL RACES

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:03.047
ALL ETHNICITIES PRETTY MUCH ALL

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.815
SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION.

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:07.018
BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:09.253
FACT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT ARE

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.022
SHOWING THAT LATINOS SPEND MORE

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.823
TIME.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.491
IN CAREGIVING THAN ALL THE OTHER

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:16.694
GROUPS --

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.929
LGBT INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.731
TO BECOME CAREGIVERS MAN.

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:23.034
SOMETIMES BY DEFAULT BECAUSE

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.102
THEY DON'T HAVE CHILDREN AND

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.937
THEREFORE IT'S ASSUME THAT

00:38:27.004 --> 00:38:28.706
YOU'LL BE THE CAREGIVER FOR MOM

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:29.006
AND DAD --

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:32.777
AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.779
DELAY SEEKING OUT SERVICES DUE

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:36.847
TO DISCRIMINATION OR FEAR OF

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.749
DISCRIMINATION.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.851
WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT AFRICAN

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:42.753
AMERICANS AND LATINOS SPEND A

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.320
HIGHER PROPORTION OF THEIR

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:46.757
INCOME ON OUT OF POCKET CARE.

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.726
THAN WHITES IN CAUCASIAN AND OF

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:50.861
WHITES AND ASIANS SO 44% VERSUS

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.930
34% [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:56.667
I'M.

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.903
I THINK THE YOU KNOW AND EVEN

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:02.640
THOSE WHO ARE FINANCIALLY ABLE

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:03.174
TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.009
ONE IT IS EXTREMELY COST

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:07.111
PROHIBITIVE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.979
THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE SAW WHICH

00:39:09.046 --> 00:39:10.981
IS TO LOOK AT ON THE FINANCIAL

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:12.983
COST OF CARE GIVING. ONE OF THE

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.819
OTHER THINGS THAT --

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:15.219
YOU'RE ONE OF THE

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:16.887
RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO EQUIP

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:18.956
CAREGIVERS WITH EARLY ACCESSIBLE

00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:21.058
INFORMATION AND TRAINING --

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.294
AND YOU KNOW CARE GIVERS ARE AT

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.664
RISK OF BURNOUT AND DEPRESSION

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:27.164
AS WAS ALLUDED EARLIER.

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:30.735
AND IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.703
CAREGIVERS WHO ARE OF A

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.672
PARTICULAR UNDER REPRESENTED

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.741
GROUPS TO LOOK FOR SERVICES TO

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.843
SEEK OUT INFORMATION AND SO

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:41.112
MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER FOR

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.847
THEM TO ACTUALLY ACCESS SERVICES

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.749
THAT MAY BE READILY AVAILABLE.

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:45.449
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.151
LOOK OR IT THAT INFORMATION IS

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.953
NOT AVAILABLE THE FOR EXAMPLE

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.288
THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT IF

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.124
THERE'S INFORMATION ABOUT IT AT

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.725
THEIR WORKPLACE.

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:55.359
BUT IT'S NOT IN SPANISH THEY

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.194
HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY CAN

00:39:57.261 --> 00:40:00.731
ACTUALLY ACCESS THIS PARTICULAR.

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.733
ITEM PROGRAM.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.267
LIKEWISE IF SOMEONE HAS A

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:04.769
PARTICULAR --

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.971
CONDITION AND THEY DON'T KNOW

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.873
HOW TO PROVIDE CARE FOR THAT

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:09.540
CONDITION OF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:12.710
IN LANGUAGE OR IN SOME WAY THAT

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:13.377
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT IT MAKES

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:16.747
IT THAT MUCH HARDER.

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.716
I AM SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:20.718
THAT ANY SERVICES WE PROVIDE DO

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:21.285
IT DOES HAVE THAT CULTURAL

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.053
RELEVANCE TO IT AND THERE ARE

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.055
SOME PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.757
DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING.

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.793
SERVICES THAT ARE TAILORED IN

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:30.895
SUCH A WAY BUT WE NEED MORE OF

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:31.529
THAT AND WE NEED MORE MATERIALS

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:36.634
IN IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES --

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.738
I OTHERS CAN HAVE GIVES SOME

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.740
REAL LIFE EXAMPLES --

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:43.440
YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I TALKED WITH

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.742
THE LEGISLATIVE AIDE WHO WAS --

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.144
ACTUALLY TALKING TO US ABOUT HER

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.913
OWN FATHER WHO HAD A DEMENTIA

00:40:48.979 --> 00:40:51.148
AND SHE WAS WONDERING WHAT

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.883
SERVICES ARE OUT THERE AND SHE

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.685
HAD EXPLORED ALL THE SERVICES.

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.754
BUT ULTIMATELY SHE DECIDED THAT

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:57.321
YOU KNOW THE BEST THING IS

00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.089
PROBABLY FOR ME TO SEND MY

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.858
FATHER BACK TO KOREA.

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.960
NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:04.962
SERVICES THERE BUT BECAUSE SHE

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.997
KNEW THAT HE WOULD AT LEAST BE

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.732
AROUND PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.701
CULTURE AND THE LANGUAGE.

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:12.803
AND THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO MANY

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.674
MANY CAREGIVERS IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.676
MAY END UP SENDING THEIR LOVED

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.276
ONE BACK TO THEIR COUNTRY OF

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:22.680
ORIGIN FOR THIS VERY REASON --

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.682
AND SIMILARLY --

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.684
YOU KNOW CHARLES CHO WHO WAS

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.884
THAT.

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.786
NOBEL PRIZE WINNER --

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:31.055
THEY LIVED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW UP

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.957
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:36.794
ARE YOU KNOW THE WIFE DID AS

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:37.461
BEST AS SHE COULD TO PROVIDE THE

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:39.029
CARE BUT AND LOOKED AT ALL THE

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.764
SERVICES AROUND.

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:41.398
IT WAS REALLY HARD THEY COULD

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:43.200
AFFORD THE CARE BUT IT WAS VERY

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:43.734
HARD FOR THEM TO LOOK FOR

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:46.804
SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY THEY TO

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:48.772
DECIDE TO MOVE BACK TO HONG KONG.

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.808
AGAIN NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.810
THERE BETTER SERVICES THERE FOR

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:54.912
ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA BUT AGAIN

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:56.747
BECAUSE OF THAT CULTURAL NATURE

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:56.981
OF IT.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:58.816
SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.985
CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW ALL THE

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.820
INNOVATION AND THE

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.788
PROGRESSIVENESS WE HAVE HERE.

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.757
A CAN CERTAINLY BE A SINKHOLE

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.659
FOR CAREGIVERS EMOTIONALLY

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.794
FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY.

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:13.097

YEARS IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.273
ON ALL THE KIDS WENT TO COLLEGE

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.108
THEY WERE ALL VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:52.843
FERNANDO SAID SOMETHING I

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.477
THOUGHT WAS REALLY COMPELLING

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:56.947
WHICH IS. ONE MOM RAISE THOSE

00:46:57.014 --> 00:47:00.717
NINE KIDS BUT WHEN THE MOMMY TO

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:02.653
CAREGIVING IN A AND THEY CAME

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.755
FROM ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEY

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:05.389
REARRANGED WORK AND THEY THEY

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:06.790
SCHEDULED.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.926
AND HE SAID THAT NINE KIDS HAD A

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.694
REALLY HARD TIME.

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.030
TRYING TO MANAGE THE CAREGIVING

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:13.430
FOR THE ONE MOM.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:15.199
AND I THINK THAT THAT REALLY

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:17.000
SHOWS THE STRUGGLES THAT

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.735
FAMILIES --

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.704
MAKE.

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.773
THIS IS THE COMMUNITY CENTER

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.675
BECAUSE FERNANDO'S MOM ALSO

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.677
AFTER SHE RAISE THE NINE KIDS

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:27.377
GAVE BACK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.712
THE COMMUNITY.

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.681
AND THEY RECOGNIZED HER BY

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:32.716
NAMING A COMMUNITY CENTER AFTER.

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:35.152
I'M NO ONE OR MANY OF US DON'T

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:37.054
EXPECT TO BE A CAREGIVER AND

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.089
WHILE OF THE TASK FORCE WAS

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.024
DOING ITS WORK I UNEXPECTEDLY.

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:43.026
BECAME A CAREGIVER FOR MY

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:44.728
HUSBAND.

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:45.028
WHO -- WAS

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.964
DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.832
ILLNESS.

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:51.068
AND I HAD EVERY POSSIBLE GOOD

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:53.003
CAREGIVING SUPPORT THAT YOU

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.738
COULD HAVE FLEXIBLE WORK.

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:57.174
ON FAMILY MEMBERS WILLING TO

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.911
FILL IN REALLY GREAT OF PEOPLE

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:02.946
THAT I WORK WITH ADEQUATE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:04.748
FINANCIAL.

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:05.382
RESOURCES AND THIS CAREGIVING

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.750
TIME WAS A GIFT.

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:10.754
AND IT WAS REALLY REALLY HARD.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.823
AND IT SORT OF THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:16.727
ARM ANY UNEXPECTED THINGS SO.

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:17.361
ONE OF THE THINGS IS YOU DON'T

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.829
MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAID

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:19.396
EVERYTHING THAT HE DID AND I

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.764
ALWAYS LIKE.

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.431
BUT IT TURNS OUT ALL THE THINGS

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:24.768
HE DID FROM THE ERRANDS TO THE

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.903
SHOPPING TO CHANGING THE KITTY

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.006
LITTER TO OPENING JARS THAT WAS

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:29.406
ALWAYS A PROBLEM.

00:48:29.473 --> 00:48:32.709
AND THEN THAT ALL GOES AWAY ON

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.711
AND THEN --

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:35.379
TO TAKE ON ALL THAT YOU TAKE ON

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:36.780
THE ROLE.

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:40.784
AND MY HUSBAND WAS VERY.

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:44.688
FAVORITE SPORTS WERE FOOTBALL.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.690
AND PAIRS SKATING.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.291
SORT OF A STRANGE COMBINATION

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:48.692
NOT.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:52.896
BUT BUT ONE OF FOR ME I DID

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.798
MEDICAL STOP FAN AND OF

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.700
TELEHEALTH.

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:57.367
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:59.136
THE HARDEST WAS TRANSFERRING IN

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:00.804
A COUPLE OF NEAR MISSES.

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.906
AND SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:04.775
TRANSFERRING AN OLYMPIC LIKE

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.843
PAIRS SKATING ACTIVITY IN WHICH

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.112
WE WOULD PLAN AND THEN WE WOULD

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.747
RATE OURSELVES SO.

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.716
I'M NOT.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.918
I HAVE TO SAY THIS DID NOT

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:17.020
HAPPEN WE HAD A COUPLE OF THE

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:18.855
NURSES.

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.456
BUT I THINK THERE'S SO MANY

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.090
THINGS AN ECHO EFFECT CAREGIVING

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:20.824
ROLE.

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:23.126
AND AND AS YOU SAID YOU'VE SEEN

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.761
ONE CAREGIVER YOU SEEN ONE

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.830
CAREGIVER AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE.

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.564
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM US

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.099
SOON DIFFERENT STORIES BUT I

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.901
THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.736
WHAT IF?

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:36.740
ON I WERE AN HOURLY WORKER AND I

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:37.407
HAD TO PUT IN THOSE HOURS TO GET

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.775
PAID.

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.877
I OR IF I HAD NO BENEFITS OR IF

00:49:40.944 --> 00:49:43.013
I HAD TO BALANCE IN MY GOING TO

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.015
PAY THE RENT OR DO SOME OF THE

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.117
OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT NEED TO

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.785
HAPPEN.

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:51.154
OR TRADING OFF SOME OF THE CARE

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.123
FOR HELPING MY KIDS WITH COLLEGE

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.192
NONE OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME.

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:57.027
IN MY CHOICES BUT YOU THINK

00:49:57.094 --> 00:49:58.795
ABOUT THE HARD CHOICES AND THE

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:00.697
SACRIFICES AND WHAT PEOPLE.

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.799
HAVE TO DO.

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.768
AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT AND

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:05.435
SEVERAL PEOPLE SAID TO ME WELL

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.037
YOU COULD DO NURSING HOME

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:08.705
PLACEMENT.

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:10.774
I AM AND AGAIN AND KNOWING WHAT

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.876
I KNOW IF IT WAS SHOCKING TO ME

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.377
THAT THEY SAID IT BUT I

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.945
UNDERSTAND AND I UNDERSTAND WHY

00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.813
FAMILIES HAVE TO DO IT.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.782
PARTICULARLY IF YOU DON'T GET

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.118
CAL WHEN YOU'RE GIVING CARE IN

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:23.153
THE HOME BUT YOU DO GET IT IN

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.821
THE FACILITY.

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:26.857
AND FACILITIES WHO ARE ABOUT TWO

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:28.692
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY SO

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.292
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MATTER CAL

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:32.729
BECAUSE FOR PLACEMENT.

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:36.800
HUGE AND ONE OF THE MAJOR --

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.702
HOLDING THE FORT AGAINST THOSE

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:39.236
PLACEMENTS ARE THE FAMILY

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:42.706
CAREGIVERS --

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.941
I'VE SEEN FAMILIES GET REPORTED

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.843
TO A PS.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.812
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T QUITE

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:49.446
PATCHED TOGETHER ALL THE HOURS

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.148
AND MOM DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:52.749
NURSING HOME.

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.918
I'VE SEEN A WORKER RUSH HOME

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:57.120
FROM HER HAIR SALON BECAUSE SHE

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.822
COULDN'T FIND MOM.

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.091
ON THE A OF THE MONITOR THAT HER

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:04.928
HER APT MONITOR AND SO SHE WAS

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:05.195
WORRIED.

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:07.130
ON MY SEEN AS YOU'VE HEARD

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:09.065
CAREGIVER SACRIFICE THEIR OWN

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:10.767
HEALTH.

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:12.769
I TRY TO CONTINUE THE CAREGIVING.

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:15.305
I'M SO WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:17.107
A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPELLING

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:18.775
ISSUE.

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:19.342
AND THEY'RE HELPING SUPPORT

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:22.779
FAMILY CAREGIVERS HELP SUPPORT.

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:25.081
ALL OF US AND SUPPORT THAT STATE

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:25.315
BUDGET.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.184
I'M SO THINKING ABOUT A NEXT

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.785
DOUBTS.

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:32.756
WE ARE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.758
WITH THAT AARP --

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:38.862
RECOMMENDATIONS ARM BUT I ALSO

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.831
WANTED -- TO

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.966
SUGGEST [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.801
THAT ALONE.

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:47.070
CONTINUING THE WORK OF THE TASK

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:49.206
FORCE AND PEOPLE IS SAID MAYBE

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.809
AND AGENCY OR SOMETHING THAT CAN.

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.878
PROVIDE SOME ONGOING INPUT SOME

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.813
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.115
ON CAREGIVERS ARE EVERYWHERE BUT

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.851
THEIR VOICES ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.853
ONE OF THE REASONS IS THEY'RE SO

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:03.453
BUSY AND THEY'RE SO EXHAUSTED

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.121
AND THEY ALSO THINK FAMILIES

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.923
THINK THIS IS OUR JOB.

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.925
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.727
DO.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.361
AND I THINK THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:13.163
THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.396
DO IT.

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:15.298
ALONE SO FAMILIES WILL DO BETTER

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:18.702
CARE GIVING AND FOR LONGER AND

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:20.704
WITH FEWER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.739
IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT.

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:23.240
THAT WAS IN THE POLICY

00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:24.841
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:27.177
AND I THINK TO CONTINUE TO HEAR

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.145
THE VOICE OF THE CAREGIVERS WILL

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.181
REALLY BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:32.883
PEOPLE IN DISABILITY COMMUNITY

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:34.818
SAY NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:35.452
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.822
THING HERE --

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:39.456
I WAS FORTUNATE RECENTLY TO GO

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.991
TO EUROPE TO LOOK AT AGE

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.959
FRIENDLY CITIES AND WHAT WE

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:43.660
COULD LEARN FROM THEM AND ONE OF

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.061
THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WAS THIS

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.763
NOTION OF CO PRODUCTION.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:50.734
WHICH IS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.368
WERE LIVING THE EXPERIENCE IN

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.769
DEVELOPING.

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:55.105
THE POLICIES IN THE PROGRAMS AND

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.907
ADVANCING THINGS FORWARD.

00:52:56.973 --> 00:53:00.977
AND BECOMING CHAMPIONS OF

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.946
BECOMING THE CHANGE THAT THEY

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.748
WANTED TO SEE AND I LOVE THAT

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:05.181
NOTION I THINK THAT

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.783
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.654
ALSO LEAD TO THAT SO I THINK WE

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.656
HAVE THIS ISSUE IT'S COMPELLING

00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:14.658
BUT ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.225
IT IS THE GREATEST I THINK

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.726
ACHIEVEMENT --

00:53:16.793 --> 00:53:18.895
IN THE TWENTIETH TWENTY FIRST

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.797
CENTURY WHICH IS LONGEVITY.

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.966
SO WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.068
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AND I

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:25.735
THINK WE CAN MAKE IT EVEN BETTER

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:28.805
THANK YOU.

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:29.439
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR DOCTOR

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:32.842

WANNA.

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:36.846

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.749
CAREGIVERS.

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.316
AND EXPANDING RESPITE CARE

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.218
OPTIONS CERTAINLY THE CAREGIVER

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:25.053
RESOURCE CENTERS WOULD BE.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.122
ON TOP OF MIND THERE ARE OTHER

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.157
RESTED OPTIONS THAT WE'D LIKE TO

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:31.159

DOZENS OF TIMES A DAY.

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.342
BUT WAIT I THOUGHT MEDICARE

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:50.912
COVERED THAT AND WE HAVE TO

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.847
EDUCATE SOMEBODY IN CRISIS ABOUT

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:55.016
THE LIMITATIONS OF MEDICARE.

THIS REALLY COINCIDE WITH THAT

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:50.705
BECAUSE WE RECENTLY --

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:51.339
INDUCTED ON OF ANTENNAS ON OUR

AND WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:07.188
ON CARE GIVERS BECAUSE THERE'S

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.757

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:15.063
TASK FORCE HAS LAID OUT SOME

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:15.397
REALLY GREAT.

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.032
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE ARE ALSO

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:19.000
DOING A STUDY FOCUSING IN ON

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.069
PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND HOW THAT

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.871
WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK.

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:25.006
FOR OUR CAREGIVERS AND WHAT ELSE

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.908
PEOPLE NEED BECAUSE SOMETIMES

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:27.509
IT'S BAILEY'S SOMETIMES IT'S

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.777
LIKE.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:29.411
YOU KNOW A PREDICTABLE SCHEDULE

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:32.814
ARE THINGS YOU KNOW THAT HOW

01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:33.381
PEOPLE BALANCE THEIR LIFE.

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.216
I'M SO YOU KNOWS PEOPLE KNOW

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.751
THAT CARE GIVING IS REALLY

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:37.419
EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING AND

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:38.787
EXHAUSTING.

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.989
IN I'M WORKING WITH HUMAN IMPACT

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.957
PARTNERS ON THE STUDY FOCUSED ON

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:43.591
CARE GIVERS AND WHY THEY'RE NOT

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.026
TAKING PAID LEAVE --

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:47.062
ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:49.030
RIGHT AWAY EVEN IN JUST DURING

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.665
THE OUTREACH IS HOW IT

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.701
INCREDIBLY EXHAUSTED.

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.969
BOB PEOPLE ARE AND I'VE BEEN

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:56.805
HEARING STORIES WHERE AT THE

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:57.339
BEGINNING OF A CARE GIVER

01:22:57.405 --> 01:22:59.140
JOURNEY IS ALSO THE BEGINNING OF

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:02.777
OFTEN A SPIRALING INTO POVERTY

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:03.445
THEY CAN REALLY TURN INTO LONG

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.080
TERM FINANCIAL INSECURITY.

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:10.752
OF I WAS ON A PANEL EARLIER THIS --

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.854
BEN BARTLETT AND HE TOLD HIS

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.889
STORY OF HIS MOTHER LOSING A JOB

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:16.725
BECAUSE OF BECOMING A CARE GIVER.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.960
AND HOW HE REMEMBERS THAT AS

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.862
JUST THAT EVERYTHING CHANGED FOR

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:21.196
HIS FAMILY --

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:23.164
INCLUDING EVEN HOMELESS SAYS

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:23.765
LIVING WITH DIFFERENT FAMILY

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.166
MEMBERS THIS IS NOT EVEN AN

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.168
UNUSUAL STORY ESPECIALLY IN

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.737
CALIFORNIA WHERE.

01:23:28.803 --> 01:23:29.070
EVERYBODY --

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.172
IS FACING SUCH A HOUSING

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.108
EVICTION CRISIS IN OTHERS YOU

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.110
NAME IT AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:37.045
I'M DOING COALITION WORK BECAUSE

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:38.813
WE'RE VERY FOCUSED IN ON

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.280
WORKPLACE POLICIES.

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:41.249
BUT WE ARE PRETTY DIVERSE IN THE

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:44.953
SENSE OF LGBTQ NEW EMIGRANTS

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.888
ARMED THEM YOU KNOW ANTI

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:47.455
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GROUPS.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.324
SO WE ARE A LOT OF GROUPS THAT

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.059
DON'T JUST FOCUS ON THIS BUT

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.994
REALLY BORING HOW DOES THIS

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:55.029
AFFECT OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE

01:23:55.096 --> 01:23:56.765
EVERYBODY.

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:57.399
IS AFFECTED BY CARE GIVING AND

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.134
IT'S YOU KNOW SUCH A KEY.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.169
ISSUE I'M SO JUST AS A QUICK

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:03.138
QUICK REFRESHER ON PAID LEAVE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.773
WHICH IS.

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.908
THE A LOT OF PROGRESS TOGETHER

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.910
IN THE COALITION WE FOUND WAS

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.745
VERY HISTORICALLY PASSED PAID

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:12.781
LEAVE IN.

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.381
TWO THOUSAND TWO AND A LOT OF

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:13.948
THE GROUPS WHERE CHILDCARE I

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:14.916
THINK I MET --

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:17.185
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ERICA I'M LIKE A

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.887
DOVE AT THAT TIME.

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:19.287
A LONG TIME AGO.

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.222
IT WAS THAT YOU KNOW REALLY

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:22.991
GREAT GROUP CAME TOGETHER WE

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.993
PASS IT WAS HISTORIC PEOPLE USED

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.162
TO SAY I MEMBER ON WEST WING

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:28.763
SOME EPISODES SOMEBODY BECAUSE A

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:29.397
HUG THEM WILL HAVE PAID FAMILY

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:29.631
LEAVE.

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.099
LIKE THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.967
EVER IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:33.635
WHAT WE'RE TALKING WE JUST HAD A

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.136
SENATE HEARING TALKING ABOUT

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.071
DOING AND WE HOPE THE RIGHT WAY

01:24:37.138 --> 01:24:39.040
NOT EATING INTO SOCIAL SECURITY.

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:41.276
THE WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING AND

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:41.810
THAT'S A LINE THAT SEEMS

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:43.211
IMMINENT THAT AT SOME POINT SOON

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.979
AS WE WELL.

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:46.881
ARM IN MEANWHILE YOU KNOW SEVEN

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:47.582
DIFFERENT STATES HAVE IT SO HE

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.451
LEAVING CALIFORNIA THAT WAS JUST

01:24:49.517 --> 01:24:51.152
A BENEFIT IT IS NOT A RIGHT THAT

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.021
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.823
PROVIDES A WAGE REPLACEMENT.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:56.991
WHEN YOU GO OUT SO WHAT DONNA

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.027
TOUCHED ON EARLIER IN THAT 40%

01:24:59.093 --> 01:25:01.062
OF PEOPLE CAN BE LEFT OUT THAT

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.797
MEANS YOU CAN LITERALLY PAY INTO

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:02.997
THIS?

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:06.801
STI YOU COVERED BY PAID LEAVE

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:07.368
FOR EITHER CARE GIVING OR

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:08.837
BONDING WITH A NEW CHILD BUT NOT

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:11.005
BE COVERED BY ONE OF THE LAWS

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:12.841
THAT PROTECT YOUR JOB.

01:25:12.907 --> 01:25:14.809
THIS IS BEEN LIKE WE HAVE

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.711
INTRODUCED AND RELIGIOUS ARENA

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:17.312
TRUTH LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:20.715
EXTEND OUR PROTECTION TO PARENTS

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.416
AND CAREGIVERS OR WE SPLIT THEM

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:22.917
UP OR WE PUT THEM TOGETHER AGAIN

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:23.418
IN A JUST TRYING IT.

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.019
ALL DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HAS HAD

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:26.988
A HUGE AMOUNT OF JUST LAST YEAR

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:28.990
ACTUALLY PATH. FOR THE FIRST

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.226
TIME I'M MORE JOB PROTECTION FOR

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.994
PARENT NEW PARENTS WE REALLY OF

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:35.196
NO FROM ALL THE STUDIES THAT

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:36.764
CAME OUT.

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.833
I SIX YEARS SEVEN YEARS AFTER

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.400
PAVE THE PAST WE LEARNED.

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.169
FROM RUTH MILKMAN AND EILEEN

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:43.071
APPLEBAUM I'M A STUDY ON PAY

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.939
LEAVING CALIFORNIA HOW IMMENSE

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.774
THE BENEFITS WERE.

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:48.743
LONGER BREASTFEEDING --

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.912
MORE DADS TAKING BONDING TIME OF

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.014
ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR THE PEOPLE

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.749
WHO TOOK IT BUT THAT SAME

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:55.416
STUDIES SHOWED US THAT IT DOES

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.252
NOT WORK FOR EVERYBODY EQUALLY.

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.020
AND THAT'S OUR PROBLEM IN

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.822
CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME NEW

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.824
IMMIGRANT LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.792
SOME REASON SUPER LOW AWARENESS.

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.995
ALL WE DID A A FIELD POLL THAT

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:10.765
SHOWED 36% AND EVEN LOWER AMONG

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.800
THE GROUPS I JUST MENTIONED.

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:14.669
SO THEY'RE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:15.236
STUDIES THAT RANGE BETWEEN

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:16.971
THIRTY SIX OR 46% BUT THAT'S

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.706
PRETTY LOW FOR ABOUT YOU KNOWS A

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:18.940
FUNDS.

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.042
THE MOST OF US PAN TO WHO SO ONE

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:23.177
OF OUR FIRST HOUSE IN THE

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.879
COALITION WAS. TO GET ON SOME

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:27.115
FUNDING IN YOU KNOW WITH EASY DO

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:27.315
SOME.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.183
EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WE THINK

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.152
THAT HOUSE THAT THAT'S BEEN A

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.754
REALLY GREAT START BUT IT HAS TO

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:33.054
GO FURTHER.

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:34.956
INTO SOME OF THE I'M IN A KIND

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.758
OF MORE COMMUNITY OUTREACH THE

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.860
OTHER ISSUE IS A FEAR OF

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:39.193
RETALIATION.

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.029
LOSING YOUR JOB WE REALLY NEED

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:43.131
TO EXTEND JOB PROTECTION --

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:45.066
TO CAREGIVERS WHEN THEY TAKE

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.801
TIME OFF BECAUSE HEAPING YOUR

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.101
JOB -- FOR

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:50.805
WORKING CAREGIVERS IS THAT HE

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.974
LOSING EVERYTHING OUT SO WE'RE

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:53.408
VERY MUCH WITH THE

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:56.711
RECOMMENDATION OF ALL OF THE

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:57.211
SUPPORT THAT WOULD MAKE

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.780
PAINFULLY WORK BETTER --

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.715
WE'VE DONE SOME THINGS LIKE

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.784
EXTEND THE WAGE REPLACEMENT WE

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:03.484
WANT TO SEE IF THAT'S WORKING IS

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.053
THAT ENOUGH IS THE NEED TO BE

01:27:05.119 --> 01:27:05.253
MORE.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.188
A COUPLE OF CITIES HAVE IT MADE

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:09.023
FULLY PAID PAID LEAVE WE'RE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.959
HOPING BERKELEY EVEN IF IT'S

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:11.359
JUST AN EXAMPLE.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:13.061
WILL DO THIS FOR CAREGIVERS TO

01:27:13.127 --> 01:27:15.029
SO WE CAN SEE HOW DOES THAT HELP

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.731
WHEN PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR FULL

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:16.898
PAY.

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.766
SOME.

01:27:18.833 --> 01:27:20.735
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:21.035
THAT -- ONE

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:22.971

FORCE IN SOME WAY --

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:37.118
SO THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:38.886
ARE HEARD BY THE THE THE BECAUSE

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.099
OF CAREGIVERS AND PARENTS ON THE

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:52.900
RIGHTS OF THE OTHER THING TOO IS

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:54.769
THAT HE LEAVES HAVING A REALLY

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:55.069
BIG MOMENT.

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:55.637
AND WE NEED TO REALLY TAKE

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:57.105
ADVANTAGE OF THAT IT'S IN THE

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.806
PRESS.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:00.842
RUBIO IS INTRODUCING A BILL BUT

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:03.011
WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO TAKE THIS

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.912
MOMENT AND STAND FOR THE

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:06.814
STRONGEST BEST MOST INCLUSIVE.

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:08.850
HAY LEAVE THAT WE CAN AND NOT IT

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.152

THAT PARENTS ARE NEEDED.

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.856
TO AND NOT BENEFIT THEM VERY

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:15.456
WELL THINK THE GROOVY A BILL

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:17.125
THAT WOULD ALSO CUTTING INTO

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:18.860
SOCIAL SECURITY WHICH IS

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:20.828
FOUNDATIONAL.

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:21.195
TO EVERYTHING.

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.864

THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IT STILL

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:25.006
FACES CHALLENGES ALL THE TIME

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.841
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GROWING AND

THE NEEDS ARE JUST GONNA

AND AND AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:46.861
IS A LITTLE BIT OF A PUSH TO

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:48.696

01:32:59.240 --> 01:32:59.573
RAPID RATE SO.

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.409
THERE'S EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:05.313
NINE MILLION I'M PEOPLE OVER

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:07.114
SIXTY FIVE BENEATH ME SO WILL

SOME TYPE OF LONG TERM CARE.

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:13.654
SO ON MEAN IF THE HOME CARE

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:17.291
INDUSTRY WORD EXPANDED OVER ALL

01:33:17.358 --> 01:33:17.959
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SOME SORT

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:19.493
OF CARE LIMITATION FOR THOSE

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.729

THOUSAND UNITS AND AS MUCH AS

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.038
THREE MEN AND ADDITIONAL HOME

CARE WORKERS DINNERS BY TWELVE

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.775
THIRTY TO MEET THAT THAT DEMAND.

01:33:34.842 --> 01:33:36.811
AND AND RIGHT NOW THE THE

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.946
INDUSTRY IS JUST NOT ATTRACTING

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.982
WORKERS BECAUSE THE WAGES AND

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:42.950
THE BENEFITS THAT'S A VERY HARD

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:44.852
JOB IT'S A VERY DEMANDING JOB.

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:47.154

OTHER ON PEOPLE ON THESE PANELS

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.225
THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE LEAVING

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.160
THEIR FULL TIME JOB ARE THERE

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.196
OTHER LUCRATIVE ABOUT WORK TO

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:57.264
TAKE CARE SOMEONE ELSE AND THEN

01:33:57.331 --> 01:34:00.968
IT PUTS THEM AND YOU KNOW ABOUT

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:02.803
FINANCIAL SUCH.

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.872
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.841
COME COME ALONG WITH TAKING ON

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:07.141
THIS ROLE.

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:10.778
SO ON THIS --

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:12.813
WASN'T SO.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.915
DOES THIS STATUS FROM TWENTY

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.984
FIFTEEN SO ON ITS LITTLE BIT

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:17.518
OUTDATED BUT THIS IS JUST

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.086
HIGHLIGHTING THE THE LOW WAGES

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:21.555
THAT HOME CARE WORKERS.

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:25.192
ARE FACING COMPARED TO OTHER ON

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:27.128
EMPLOYEES OPPORTUNITIES AND A

01:34:27.194 --> 01:34:32.767
LOT OF HOME CARE WORKERS ARE ARE

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:34.735
THAN THAT SO.

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:36.804
EITHER LIVING AND BLOWING THEM

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.706
HOUSEHOLDERS RECEIVING PUBLIC

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.841
ASSISTANCE THAT SOUTH NOT ONLY A

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:41.308
BOUTIQUE AIRSOFT GUN.

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.777
THAT IS ON MEDI CAL OR AND IS

01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:43.477
RELYING ON THESE PROGRAMS BUT AS

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:44.845
A HOME CARE WORKER MANY OF THEM

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:47.048
ARE ALSO RELYING ON THOSE ON

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:49.016
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:54.755
GET BY.

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.757
SO THOSE IDEA THE NEXT SLIDE.

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:59.126
SO YOUR VISITORS GOING INTO MORE

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:01.062
OF THE ODD ON IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:01.128 --> 01:35:04.732
ABOUT 22% OF HOME CARE WORKERS

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.767
ARE RELYING ON FOOD STAMPS.

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.969
AND 22% ARE LIVING OUT OUR BELOW

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:10.771
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.074
SO THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.844
AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF HOME CARE

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:18.913
WORKERS ARE ARE AT MINIMUM WAGE --

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.981
A LOT OF THEM DON'T RECEIVE

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:22.883
HEALTH INSURANCE.

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.852
AND ON IT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.987
DIFFICULT AND IT'S IT'S A VERY

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:30.758
DIFFICULT HOME PROGRAM AND A GUN

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:32.827
YOU KNOW WE AS A UNION WE WE

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.762
BARGAIN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:35.329
THERE'S FIFTY SIX COUNTIES

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.864
THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO EACH

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:37.498
COUNTY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.133
ANOTHER ON AND HOW WILLING.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.068
THEY ARE TO INVEST IN I JUST US

01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:44.972
AND HOME CARE WORK ARMS SO YOU

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:45.573
KNOW IT'S HARD TO REALLY GET

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:46.874
THIS WORKFORCE TO BE RECOGNIZES

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.976
A PROFESSIONAL REALLY VALUED.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:52.880
AND GROUP OF WORKERS THINK

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.782
THERE'S THIS PERCEPTION THAT'S

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:55.382
MAYBE STARTING TO CHANGE NOW

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:56.817
THAT.

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.686
HOME CARE WORKERS ARE JUST

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:00.788
ALMOST LIKE A HOUSE KEEPER DOING

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:03.090
HOME HOMEMAKING WORK AND THAT'S

01:36:03.157 --> 01:36:05.059
JUST NOT TRUE ON THEIR DOING SO

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:05.659
MUCH MORE THAN THAT THEY'RE

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.094
KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE IN THEIR

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:08.996
HOMES I'M A LOT OF THEM ARE

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.798
DOING MEDICAL TASK SO.

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.933
I THINK WE HAVE TO GET TO THE

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:13.567
POINT WHERE THIS PROFESSION IS

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.169
REALLY RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:18.772
AND THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS TO

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:19.340
OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:22.943
DISABILITY.

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:26.814
SO JUST GOING INTO THAT --

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.716
THERE'S SOME STATS THAT SAY AND

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:29.450
I JUST US THE ANNUAL TURNOVER IS

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:32.953
AS HIGH AS 33% WHICH MEANS THAT.

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.855
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:37.291
THOUSAND CONSUMERS ARE OR

01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:37.892

CARE HAVE TO FIND A NEW PROVIDER.

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.264
EVERY YEAR.

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:44.965

DEMAND AND WHAT THE THERE AND

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:55.409
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CARE THAT

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:56.944

LITERALLY NO PRODUCT OF BRAIN

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.079
LACK OF VALUE OF THIS TYPE OF

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:21.215
LABOR HISTORICALLY [INAUDIBLE]

LABOR WAS DONE I'M PAID

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:30.991
UNRECOGNIZED AT HOME.

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:34.862
AND I WAS SIMPLY NOT A TOPIC OF

PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND WAS SIMPLY

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.799

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:47.374
DIFFERENT WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:49.009
LIVING LONGER AND FOLKS DELUDE

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.911
WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME.

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:53.080
AND WE HAVE A CRISIS BECAUSE HOW

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:54.848
DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT HOW DO YOU

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.750
HAVE A SYSTEM.

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.952
WHERE NON CURRENTLY EXISTS

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.788
EXCEPT FOR THIS INFORMAL --

01:41:00.854 --> 01:41:02.756
SYSTEM OR NON SYSTEM.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.758
SO.

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:06.727
OUT OF CHAOS WE NEED TO BIRTH

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:08.796
SOMETHING NEW AND WE HAVE AN

01:41:08.862 --> 01:41:09.430
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING NEW

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.931
BECAUSE REVENUE GOVERNOR.

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:11.565
AND THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:16.770
GOVERNOR WE CONSTELLATION OF OF

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:18.705
FACTORS WE'VE GOT THE THREAT OF

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:19.373
LOSING MEDICAID FUNDING WHICH IS

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.709
JUST A QUESTION OF TIME AND ALL

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:23.310
OF THIS IS FUNDED BY MEDICAID

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:23.610
[INAUDIBLE]

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:24.778
WE'VE GOT.

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:28.849
THE CRISIS WITHIN IHS US ITSELF

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.818
WHICH IS THAT THEY COUNTIES THE

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:33.187
SHARING OF COSTS OF I JUST AS IF

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.055
YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WORKS AT THE

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:36.790
COUNTY LEVEL.

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:37.357
THEY WILL TELL YOU THERE'S A

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:41.061
HUGE PROBLEM WITH COUNTY IS NOT --

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:42.796
GETTING.

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:44.932
ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE STATE TO

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.900
COVER THE COSTS IN ITS JUST AS

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:49.102
ONGOING OUR PROBLEM THAT IS A

01:41:49.169 --> 01:41:50.971
GROUP REACHING WHAT I WOULD SAY

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:52.840
A PAX RIGHT NOW --

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:55.108
AND WE'VE GOT THIS LACK OF

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.144
WORKERS IT AS AMENDED JUST THAT

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.112
PEOPLE NEED TO BE RECRUITED TO

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:01.148
DO THIS WORK BUT WHY SHOULD THEY

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.783
DO THAT WHEN THEY COULD GO WORK

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:03.116
AT MCDONALDS.

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.885
AND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:07.087
STRESS AND GET PAID THE SAME

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:07.488
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:09.156
SO WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM BUT OUT

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:11.158
OF PROBLEM IS OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:13.126
SOMETHING NEW AND SIGNIFICANT

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:14.895
AND DIFFERENT [INAUDIBLE]

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:17.264
AND FOR THE SPEAKING ON BEHALF

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:20.801
OF YOU W. WE SEE THE ONLY

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.836
SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS BEING.

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:23.337
THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:27.040
INSURANCE MODEL BECAUSE WHAT

01:42:27.107 --> 01:42:28.709
WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH STUDYING

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:30.711
PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:31.011
INSURANCE.

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:33.113
IS THAT IT IS SIMPLY NOT A

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.015
PROFITABLE PRODUCT NOT ENOUGH

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:37.084
PEOPLE BUY THE PRODUCT TO OFFSET

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:39.219
THE RISK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.754
IT.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.823
SO FROM INSURANCE PERSPECTIVE

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:44.958
UNLESS YOU MANDATE BUT EVERYBODY

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:47.094
BY IT AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.729
HAPPENED WITH THAT EXPERIMENT

01:42:48.795 --> 01:42:49.096
BICU YEARS AGO.

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:52.733
OF OR RECENTLY OF YOU MANDATE

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:53.333
EITHER YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.035
MANDATING EVERYBODY BY THE

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:57.137
INSURANCE OR YOU'RE APPROACHING

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:58.906
IT FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:42:58.972 --> 01:42:59.439
ANGLE WHICH IS A SOCIAL

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:00.974
INSURANCE MODEL WHICH I WOULD

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.776
ARGUE IS BEHIND.

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:05.012
THE SUCCESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:06.947
THAT WE DO HAVE LIKE SOCIAL

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.782
SECURITY AND MEDICARE PEOPLE.

01:43:08.849 --> 01:43:10.884
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN REALIZE

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.920
THEY'RE PAYING INTO IT THERE IS

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.855
NOW A SOCIETAL EXPECTATION THAT

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.957
THIS IS WHAT YOU WORK TOWARD AN

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:19.092
URN AND HAVE. TO EXPECT AS YOU

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:21.194
GET OLDER AND WE NEED TO SEE THE

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.196
SAME THING HAPPENED IN THIS

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:25.165
ARENA AND FRANKLY LIKE SUSAN

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:27.200
SAID MOST PEOPLE THINK IT'S

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:27.768
ALREADY THE CASE IT'S JUST

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:28.802
ACTUALLY NOT.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:30.704
SO WE'VE GOT TO FIX THAT.

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:34.841
AND IF THIS IS AN OVERWHELMING --

01:43:34.908 --> 01:43:36.877
ISSUE DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:37.544
NOT LIKE THERE'S THIS YOU KNOW

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:39.046
THERE'S LIKE ONE PAGE HERE'S THE

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.881
ANSWER WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:41.415
FIGURE IT OUT AND WARY.

01:43:41.481 --> 01:43:43.283
NO WORKING WITH A LOT OF FOLKS

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.118
IN THE ROOM ON ON DOING THE HARD

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.920
WORK OF THAT.

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.889
SO I THINK OUT OF CRISIS COMES

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:50.691
OPPORTUNITY AND THIS COMMITTEE

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:53.060
CAN PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:55.062
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A SEXY ISSUE.

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:55.696
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE

01:43:55.762 --> 01:44:00.701
PARKING A I IT IT'S A CRISIS

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:02.703
THAT GOES IN ISOLATION IN ON

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.005
RECOGNIZED AND FRANKLY I'M

01:44:05.072 --> 01:44:05.439
SHOCKED THAT MORE.

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.274
A PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:09.142
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE I

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:10.744
WOULD THINK THIS CROSSES EVERY.

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:13.080
DAM AGE GROUP DEMOGRAPHIC YOU

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:14.948
NAME IT PEOPLE NEED TO START

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:16.750
TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:18.952
AND SO LET ME JUST LEAVE IT WITH

01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:21.021
THIS WE BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:23.090
IS THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:24.758
INSURANCE MODEL.

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:25.292
WE WANT TO WORK WITH --

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:28.929
ALL OUR LEGISLATIVE A CHAMPIONS

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.998
TO DO THIS AND WITH OUR OTHER

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:32.766
STAKEHOLDERS TO DO THIS.

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:34.868
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY I WOULD

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.737
SAY ONCE IN A GENERATION RIGHT

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:38.805
NOW TO DO WE HAVE A WINDOW OF

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:39.439
OPPORTUNITY AND AND IF WE DON'T

01:44:39.506 --> 01:44:40.774
THEN.

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:42.776
SHAME ON US.

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.911
MAY I ALSO JUST SAY ONE LAST

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:45.512
THING THE ONE THING THAT THE

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:47.180
STATE CAN DO LEGISLATIVELY TO

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:48.782
ADDRESS.

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:49.316
THE WRECK IT ONE OF THE

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:51.018
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S IN THE

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.986
TASK FORCE REPORT.

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:55.322
IS THE FACT THAT PARENT AND

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:56.790
SPOUSE.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:45:00.827
I JUST AS PROVIDERS SAID THIS IS

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:02.996
PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR THE CHILD

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.698
OR A SPOUSE.

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:08.735
ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:10.737
MEDICARE OR SOCIAL SECURITY OR

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.173
DO NOT AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:14.808
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT IS

01:45:14.875 --> 01:45:16.810
AN IMMEDIATE.

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:19.112
POLICY PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:45:19.179 --> 01:45:21.081
ADDRESSED BECAUSE YOU COULD

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:23.183
LITERALLY WORK YOUR WHOLE ADULT

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:25.018
LIFE AND I JUST SAYS.

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:28.989
AND HAVE ZERO WHEN YOU RETIRE

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:30.957
AND WE ALL KNOW SOCIAL SECURITY

01:45:31.024 --> 01:45:32.959
IS NOT MUCH TO BEGIN WITH BUT

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:33.493
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT.

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.928
AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:37.030
PREVENTING THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.099
CAREGIVERS FAMILY CARRIERS THAT

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:42.703
IS THE NUMBER ONE POLICY

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:43.336
PERSCRIPTION THAT I WOULD OFFER

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.938
THE PROBLEM IS.

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:47.107
THAT THE MEDICARE SOCIAL

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:48.942
SECURITY ISSUES A FEDERAL ISSUE

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:51.111
SO THE CHANCES OF THAT GETTING

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:51.344
FIXED.

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:54.715
OUR ABOUT AS GOOD AS MY CHANCE

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.750
OF FLOATING OUT OF THIS ROOM.

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.785
BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE TRUE FOR

01:45:58.852 --> 01:45:59.419
ALL WAYS IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:01.221
INSURANCE ISSUE ACTUALLY CAN BE

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:03.190
ADDRESS ON THE STATE LEVEL SO WE

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:05.158
DO WANT TO WORK WITH OTHER

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:07.060
ADVOCATES AND WITH THE COMMITTEE

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:08.995
ON THAT AS WELL SO LET ME JUST

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:09.396
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:09.796

INTRODUCES AND PASSES AND SIGNS

01:51:38.925 --> 01:51:41.061

PREPARED BUT WE CAN'T GO

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:55.160
BACKWARDS.

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:56.962

OVERWORKED THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:37.169
PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY TO

EVEN APPROVED [INAUDIBLE]

02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:46.945
HEALTH AND THE PERSON THAT OWNED

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:49.014
THE FACILITY GOT IT THROUGH

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.782
BANKRUPTCY.

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:52.751
AND IT WASN'T EVEN AUTHORIZED

02:09:52.818 --> 02:09:56.788
AND THIS PERSON.

02:09:56.855 --> 02:09:57.289
IS GETTING A LOT OF HIS

02:09:57.356 --> 02:10:00.792

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:01.326
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:01.727
DELEON [INAUDIBLE]

02:10:01.793 --> 02:10:04.796
VERBIAGE.

02:10:04.863 --> 02:10:06.765
THE CERTIFIED I BELIEVE THEY'RE

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:07.432
TAKING THE FACILITIES AWAY FROM

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.234
HIM BECAUSE OF DEFICIENCIES THAT

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:10.802
WERE.

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:11.403

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:12.704
ACTED UPON IT.

02:10:12.771 --> 02:10:14.940
SO YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A MATTER

02:10:15.007 --> 02:10:16.775
OF PUT PUTTING THE PEOPLE FIRST

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:18.810
MAYBE HAVING TO SOCIALIZE.

02:10:18.877 --> 02:10:21.113
AND I KNOW WITH US WAS TUGWELL

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.781
SOCIALISM BUT A SOCIALISTIC

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:24.750
DEMAGOGUE DEMOCRACY BUT

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:25.284
SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN.

02:10:46.905 --> 02:10:48.974
SHE WAS OF YOUR CARE CAREGIVER

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.776
FOR MY GRANDPARENTS --

02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:52.711
NOW'S A CAREGIVER FOR MY FATHER

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:53.278
I'M I'M A STUDENT AT JOHNS

02:10:53.345 --> 02:10:55.047
HOPKINS UNIVERSITY AND THIS IS A

02:10:55.113 --> 02:10:56.782
GREAT CONVERSATION --

02:10:56.848 --> 02:11:00.719

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.721
ANY CONSIDERATIONS TAKEN --

02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:03.322
INTO TAPPING INTO THE STUDENT

02:11:03.388 --> 02:11:04.756
DEBT.

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:07.159

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:08.994
TAP INTO THE STUDENT DEBT AND

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:09.628

INTO THE STATE.

02:11:10.929 --> 02:11:12.731
I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:14.866
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BECAUSE

02:11:14.933 --> 02:11:16.802
THERE'S A FINANCIAL BURDEN --

02:11:16.868 --> 02:11:18.770
WITH CAREGIVING AND AS LONG.

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:22.741
DO NOT TAKE --

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.743
MAJOR SUCH AS HEALTHCARE INTO

02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:26.745
ACCOUNT SO IF THAT'S POSSIBLE

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:27.412

ORIGINALLY FROM CALIFORNIA BUT

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.820
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT --

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:35.287
THEY HAVE TAKEN INTO

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:36.989
CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY AS

THEY ARE.

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:57.276
NOT KNOWN ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE

02:11:57.342 --> 02:11:59.011
UNTIL JUST YESTERDAY I WAS AT A

02:11:59.077 --> 02:12:01.179
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COME LATER DUBS --

02:12:01.246 --> 02:12:03.015
OPEN HOUSE BUT I'M I'M A

02:12:03.081 --> 02:12:06.818
FINANCIAL PLANNER AND I EDUCATE

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:08.820
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ABOUT LONG

02:12:08.887 --> 02:12:10.922
TERM CARE PLANNING BECAUSE IT'S

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:12.891
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PITFALLS --

02:12:12.958 --> 02:12:14.860
IN DOING A RETIREMENT PLAN.

02:12:14.926 --> 02:12:16.895
AND LOT OF PEOPLE AS THE PANEL

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:18.764
BEEPED OR SAYING.

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:20.732
DON'T REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:21.266
COVERED BY THEIR MEDICAL

02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:22.901
INSURANCE IS NOT COVERED BY

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:23.168
MEDICARE.

02:12:23.235 --> 02:12:25.170
AND THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY HAVE

02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:27.139
A SAFETY NET IS WHAT THE STATE

02:12:27.205 --> 02:12:28.874
OF CALIFORNIA FOR A CALIFORNIAN.

02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:31.109
AND THIS IS A HUGE TICKING

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:34.780
FINANCIAL FISCAL TIME BOMB.

02:12:34.846 --> 02:12:36.748
AND LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE IT BUT

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:39.217
I AS ONE OF THE OTHER PANEL

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:40.852
MEMBERS MENTIONED --

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:43.021

IN THE COUNTRY HAVE LONG TERM

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:44.890
CARE INSURANCE.

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:48.760
SO THAT MEANS 95% OF THE PEOPLE

02:12:48.827 --> 02:12:49.361
THAT DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND

02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:50.896
DON'T HAVE ASSETS.

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:53.065

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.966
THE STATE ASSISTANCE THERE'S NO

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:56.868

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:29.101
OF PLANNING NOW IT DOESN'T MEAN

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:30.869
YOU HAVE TO BUY INSURANCE BUT

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:31.436
YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:31.636
