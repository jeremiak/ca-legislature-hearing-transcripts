FAMILY DETENTION AT OUR BORDER.

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:10.621 region:rollup2

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:16.160 region:rollup2
SIMPLY ACT IN A HUMANE MANNER.

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:17.728 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE WITNESSED IN RECENT

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.328 region:rollup2
MONTHS?

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:20.564 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY PERSONAL TO MANY OF

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:21.065 region:rollup2
US.

00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.332 region:rollup2
BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE

00:53:21.065 --> 00:53:24.535 region:rollup2
PERSONAL.

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:26.537 region:rollup2
TO ALMOST ALL OF US.

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:27.971 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS NEARLY ALL

00:53:26.537 --> 00:53:29.807 region:rollup2
OF OUR ANCESTORS AT ONE POINT

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:30.941 region:rollup2

AND MANY TIMES.

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.617 region:rollup2
THE STORY WASN'T ALWAYS SO

00:53:38.482 --> 00:53:42.152 region:rollup2
CLEAN.

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:44.955 region:rollup2
I THINK THOSE OF US WHOSE

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:46.724 region:rollup2
ANCESTORS CAME MOST RECENTLY.

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:47.658 region:rollup2
MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY

00:53:46.724 --> 00:53:49.626 region:rollup2
OF THEIR STORIES IN A DIFFERENT

00:53:47.658 --> 00:53:51.361 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:52.296 region:rollup2
I KNOW PERSONALLY.

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:54.231 region:rollup2
HOW MY FATHER CAME TO THIS

00:53:52.296 --> 00:53:55.532 region:rollup2
COUNTRY?

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:56.934 region:rollup2
AND I'M LIKE SO MANY OF THE

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:59.503 region:rollup2
REFUGEES THAT ARE COMING TODAY

00:53:56.934 --> 00:54:01.271 region:rollup2
HE DIDN'T COME.

00:53:59.503 --> 00:54:04.541 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:06.210 region:rollup2
HE CAME FOR A BETTER LIFE.

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:07.544 region:rollup2
BUT I'LL ALSO KNOW IS COMPLEX HE

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.413 region:rollup2
CAME RIGHT WHEN THE BRASS SADDLE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.747 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WAS ENDING.

00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:12.716 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO REELS LINE TO STAND

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:14.451 region:rollup2
DOWN.

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:16.186 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT THE WE CAN A NOD.

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:18.722 region:rollup2
AND GROWERS WHO DESPERATELY

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:19.923 region:rollup2
NEEDED CHEAP LABOR.

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:22.126 region:rollup2
FOLKS COULD CROSS THE BORDER

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:24.328 region:rollup2
HERE TO WORK [inaudible]

00:54:22.126 --> 00:54:25.362 region:rollup2
WAS COMPLICATED.

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:27.998 region:rollup2
THE LEGALITY OF IT IS

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:30.334 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED.

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:33.370 region:rollup2
AND EVEN TODAY WE TRY TO CLEAN

00:54:30.334 --> 00:54:35.172 region:rollup2
UP THE WAY IN WHICH HE GOT HERE.

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.907 region:rollup2
PICKED OUR FOOD.

00:54:35.172 --> 00:54:39.710 region:rollup2
PACKED OUR FOOD.

STARTED A BUSINESS PAID TAXES

SEND HIS KIDS TO COLLEGE.

00:54:41.712 --> 00:54:46.250 region:rollup2
INSTILL STRUGGLES TO TRY TO

00:54:42.713 --> 00:54:47.317 region:rollup2
BECOME A CITIZEN.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.520 region:rollup2
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE ALWAYS

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:51.421 region:rollup2
BEEN COMPLEX.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.923 region:rollup2
BUT SO MANY OF US WHO KNOW THOSE

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:55.259 region:rollup2
STORIES OF OUR PARENTS OR

00:54:52.923 --> 00:54:56.393 region:rollup2
GRANDPARENTS OR MAYBE OURSELVES.

00:54:55.259 --> 00:54:58.162 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED AT THE

00:54:56.393 --> 00:55:00.898 region:rollup2
BORDER TODAY AND REALIZE THAT

00:54:58.162 --> 00:55:03.500 region:rollup2
COULD SO EASILY BE US.

00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:06.370 region:rollup2
I'M HONEST ABOUT MY FAMILY.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:08.906 region:rollup2
WHO'VE COME FROM MEXICO.

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:10.240 region:rollup2
ALL WITH DIFFERENT STATUS.

00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:12.442 region:rollup2
SOME CAME ON A VISA THAT THEY

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.411 region:rollup2
OVERSTATED.

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
SOME SIMPLY CAME HERE WITHOUT

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:18.248 region:rollup2
ANY DOCUMENTATION.

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:19.883 region:rollup2
SOME CAME IN WHAT THEY'RE

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:22.252 region:rollup2
CALLING CHAIN MIGRATION AND

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:23.587 region:rollup2
MARRIED SOMEBODY.

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:25.122 region:rollup2
BUT NONE OF THEM HAD A FORMAL

00:55:23.587 --> 00:55:27.591 region:rollup2
PASSED.

00:55:25.122 --> 00:55:29.226 region:rollup2
A LEGAL PATH.

00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:30.661 region:rollup2
NOT OF A MORE FACING ATROCITIES

00:55:29.226 --> 00:55:32.129 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE COMING

00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:33.030 region:rollup2
TODAY FROM THESE COUNTRIES WHERE

00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:35.566 region:rollup2
THERE TED.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.134 region:rollup2
WEEKLY FLEEING FOR THEIR LIFE.

00:55:35.566 --> 00:55:38.001 region:rollup2
MOST OF MY RELATIVES DIDN'T COME

00:55:37.134 --> 00:55:39.603 region:rollup2
WITH CHILDREN THAT THEY HAD TO

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:42.706 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT BEING SEPARATED FROM

00:55:39.603 --> 00:55:44.208 region:rollup2
THEY CAME HERE AND HAD CHILDREN.

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:46.777 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:48.712 region:rollup2
TODAY I'D BE A HYPOCRITE. TO NOT

00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:50.847 region:rollup2
STAND UP.

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:53.083 region:rollup2
AND SAY HOW WRONG IT IS.

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:54.384 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SEE CHILDREN CRYING FOR

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.787 region:rollup2
THEIR PARENTS AND PARENTS CRYING

00:55:54.384 --> 00:55:58.288 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR CHILDREN?

00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SEE THE POSSIBILITY

00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:00.791 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:04.661 region:rollup2
A FAMILIES.

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:07.097 region:rollup2
LIVING TOGETHER INCARCERATED.

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:08.432 region:rollup2
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:10.634 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO THINK THAT WE'RE A

00:56:08.432 --> 00:56:11.969 region:rollup2
BETTER COUNTRY THAN NOT.

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:15.572 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NO MATTER IF YOU KNOW

00:56:11.969 --> 00:56:17.140 region:rollup2
YOUR IMMIGRANT HISTORY. FOR THE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:18.208 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF US WHO.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.676 region:rollup2
WHO SOMEHOW HAVE AN IMMIGRANT

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:21.345 region:rollup2
HISTORY?

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:22.646 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER YOU SIMPLY LIVE IN

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:24.948 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THERE IS ONE THING

00:56:22.646 --> 00:56:26.383 region:rollup2
THAT'S CLEAR.

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:27.985 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALL BENEFITED FROM THE

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:29.152 region:rollup2
HARD WORK.

00:56:27.985 --> 00:56:31.622 region:rollup2
OF THOSE WHO CAME HERE WITHOUT

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:32.823 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION.

00:56:31.622 --> 00:56:35.292 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A POPULAR THING TO SEE

00:56:32.823 --> 00:56:36.627 region:rollup2
OR TALK ABOUT.

00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:38.729 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE HAD OUR CHILDREN

00:56:36.627 --> 00:56:40.797 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF WE HAD OUR

00:56:38.729 --> 00:56:43.634 region:rollup2
BATHROOMS CLEANED.

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:45.335 region:rollup2
WE HAD OUR LANDSCAPED DONE.

00:56:43.634 --> 00:56:47.137 region:rollup2
WE HAD OUR TABLES BUST OUR FOOD

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:49.172 region:rollup2
COOKED.

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:50.374 region:rollup2
AN EVEN IF YOU WANT TO DENY ANY

00:56:49.172 --> 00:56:52.042 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU'VE NEVER

00:56:50.374 --> 00:56:53.910 region:rollup2
BEEN EATEN OUT AT A RESTAURANT

00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:54.745 region:rollup2
OR EATING OUT AT A RESTAURANT OR

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.679 region:rollup2
IN A HOTEL.

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:59.316 region:rollup2
HAVING SOMEONE CLEAN UP AFTER

00:56:55.679 --> 00:57:00.150 region:rollup2
YOU I GUARANTEE YOU THIS.

00:56:59.316 --> 00:57:01.818 region:rollup2
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN FOOD.

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:04.521 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PICKED [inaudible]

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:06.723 region:rollup2
IMPACT BY SOMEBODY WHO'S HERE

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
ILLEGALLY.

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:10.093 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS ALWAYS IN OUR BEST

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:12.429 region:rollup2
INTERESTS TO TURN A BLIND EYE

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:14.731 region:rollup2
BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE.

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:16.133 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN'T ON ONE HAND.

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:18.602 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FRUITS OF THE LABOR OF

00:57:16.133 --> 00:57:20.437 region:rollup2
HARD WORKING FOLKS IN THE STATE.

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:22.139 region:rollup2
AND ON THE OTHER HAND LOOK AT

00:57:20.437 --> 00:57:26.176 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT OUR BORDER.

00:57:22.139 --> 00:57:27.878 region:rollup2
THAT IT JUSTIFIES HUMANITY AND

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:30.080 region:rollup2
NOT STAND UP AND SAY.

00:57:27.878 --> 00:57:31.448 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH US

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:34.217 region:rollup2
THIRTY SECONDS WHAT WE CAN'T

00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:36.186 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPEN BORDER.

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:38.989 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:40.324 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE TO HAVE RULES.

00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:41.692 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE RULES CAN TREAT PEOPLE

00:57:40.324 --> 00:57:43.060 region:rollup2
IN A MORE HUMANE WAY.

00:57:41.692 --> 00:57:45.629 region:rollup2
AND OUR IMMIGRATION POLICIES CAN

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.564 region:rollup2
BE FIXED WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:49.032 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.433 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:52.035 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:57:49.433 --> 00:57:52.803 region:rollup2
NOT ANIMALS.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:55.172 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EYE ON

00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:56.707 region:rollup2
THIS RESOLUTION.

FORTY SIX I WAS SIXTH WHEN I WAS

I DO ME NO QUIET IS IS ONE OF

00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:16.360 region:rollup2
THE MOST DANGEROUS CITIES IN THE

00:58:15.092 --> 00:58:17.928 region:rollup2
WORLD.

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.596 region:rollup2
MY FATHER HAD BEEN PART OF THE

00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:21.465 region:rollup2
BETH HAD A PROGRAM.

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:23.367 region:rollup2

BUT DAVID DETAINED MY DAD.

00:58:28.105 --> 00:58:30.407 region:rollup2
HE HAD BEEN WORKING IN

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:31.775 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

00:58:30.407 --> 00:58:34.077 region:rollup2
WE WERE UP IN A PARK IN WINNIE

00:58:31.775 --> 00:58:35.145 region:rollup2
TEXAS.

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:36.680 region:rollup2
AND I REMEMBER MEN IN UNIFORM.

00:58:35.145 --> 00:58:39.149 region:rollup2
TALKING WITH HIM.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.716 region:rollup2
I WAS SCARED.

00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:42.219 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE US AN

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:42.819 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO GATHER OUR THINGS

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:46.623 region:rollup2
BEFORE SENDING US BACK TO WHAT

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:47.257 region:rollup2
IT. FOR A LONG TIME.

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.325 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS AFFECTED AT

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.893 region:rollup2
ALL [inaudible]

00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:52.129 region:rollup2
OR MUCH.

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:53.864 region:rollup2
BY THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:58:52.129 --> 00:58:54.965 region:rollup2
BUT BUILT FRIGHTENING MEMORIES.

00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:57.868 region:rollup2
CAME RUSHING BACK.

00:58:54.965 --> 00:58:58.702 region:rollup2
AS I WATCH IMMIGRANT FAMILIES

00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:00.670 region:rollup2
BEING SEPARATED AND CHILDREN

00:58:58.702 --> 00:59:02.939 region:rollup2
CAGED.

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:05.742 region:rollup2
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:06.243 region:rollup2
MY SISTERS AND MY BROTHERS.

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.612 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT OF MY OWN TWO

00:59:06.243 --> 00:59:10.747 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:59:08.612 --> 00:59:12.149 region:rollup2
WHAT IF IT HAD BEEN THEM?

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:13.884 region:rollup2
NOT KNOWING.

00:59:12.149 --> 00:59:16.720 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE COLD OR HUNGRY.

00:59:13.884 --> 00:59:18.488 region:rollup2
OR IN DANGER.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.724 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT A I WAS UNABLE

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:21.725 region:rollup2
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:59:20.724 --> 00:59:25.562 region:rollup2
THIS IS HORRIFYING AND THEN

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:26.797 region:rollup2
HUMANE.

00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:29.232 region:rollup2
MY PARENTS ONLY WANTED A BETTER

00:59:26.797 --> 00:59:31.068 region:rollup2

WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN.

00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:35.906 region:rollup2

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:38.809 region:rollup2
CITIZEN.

00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:41.144 region:rollup2
MY LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY. FOR

FOR ELECTED OFFICE.

00:59:44.014 --> 00:59:47.284 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY STORY.

00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:48.852 region:rollup2

SEEKING FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY.

PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE

00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:57.961 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ADMIRED AMERICA. FOR ITS

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:59.696 region:rollup2
COMPASSION AND OPENNESS TO

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:01.631 region:rollup2
EMIGRATE TO IMMIGRANTS.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:03.133 region:rollup2

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:09.539 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.774 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO DEMONIZED IMMIGRANTS.

THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WILL BE

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup2
TRAUMATIZED FOR EVER.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:29.593 region:rollup2
THIS IS WRONG.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:32.295 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:33.196 region:rollup2

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:07.490 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT AMERICA.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:08.458 region:rollup2
AND IS NOT AMERICAN.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.293 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DO THIS WE'RE BETTER

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
THAN THIS.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:14.531 region:rollup2

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:16.766 region:rollup2
MOST OF US.

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:18.435 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS NOT NO THIS IS NOT

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.971 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:22.872 region:rollup2
A EVEN THOUGH I'VE READ ABOUT IT

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:24.774 region:rollup2
AND PEOPLE TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.909 region:rollup2
A I CAN ONLY [inaudible]

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:27.177 region:rollup2
IMAGINE [inaudible]

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.511 region:rollup2
WHAT [inaudible]

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:30.347 region:rollup2
AFRICANS [inaudible]

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:31.414 region:rollup2
WENT THROUGH.

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:33.183 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TO BE PULLED FROM THEIR

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:34.918 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:37.554 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO BEING PLACED.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.722 region:rollup2
IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:41.324 region:rollup2
AND THEN TO HAVE THE FATHER SOLD

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:43.326 region:rollup2
OFF.

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:45.895 region:rollup2
AND THE MOTHER SOLD OFF AND ALSO

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:46.196 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN SEPARATED

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:47.497 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:50.467 region:rollup2
THE FEAR.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:52.102 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COSTS AND SOME OF

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:53.837 region:rollup2
THESE CHILDREN WILL NEVER.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:57.641 region:rollup2
BE REUNITED.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:58.942 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL PARENTS.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:01.077 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.945 region:rollup2
WITH THIS POLICY.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:03.246 region:rollup2

WEEKS AGO I STOOD TO SPEAK ON ON

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:29.706 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY AND EVEN A FEW WEEKS

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:32.309 region:rollup2
AGO WE HAD LITTLE INDICATION.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:34.778 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.745 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RECEIVED A WHICH HAS

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:38.314 region:rollup2
BEEN SO.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:40.917 region:rollup2
HORRIFYING IN STARTLING THAT I

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:42.886 region:rollup2
THINK MANY OF US HAVE HIGH I HAD

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.287 region:rollup2
A HARD TIME PROCESSING AT US

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
THIS LAST WEEK AND THERE WERE

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:47.390 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS THAT MARCHED ACROSS

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.826 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:52.462 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYING WE NEED TO KEEP

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:55.699 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TOGETHER THIS AGAIN IS

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:58.168 region:rollup2
NOT A REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT ISSUE.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:04:00.470 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN AMERICAN ISSUE.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:03.073 region:rollup2
AND I STAND AGAIN AS A MOTHER IN

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:04.974 region:rollup2
AS AN EDUCATOR.

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.710 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO MAKE SOME SENSE OF THE

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:09.612 region:rollup2
US AND I KNOW WE HAVE THE

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:11.181 region:rollup2
DADDIES CAUCUS HERE OF COURSE

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:12.449 region:rollup2
THE MOMMIES COCCUS AND

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.983 region:rollup2
GRANDMOTHERS AND GRAHAM.

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:15.251 region:rollup2
LAWYERS AND AID IN I JUST THE

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:17.454 region:rollup2
PICTURE I PAINTED LEARNING I

01:04:15.251 --> 01:04:18.421 region:rollup2
HAVE FOUR OF MY OWN GROWING

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:19.556 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:24.127 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ABOUT ONE OF MY

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:25.562 region:rollup2
DAUGHTERS WHO I I FEEL LIKE IT

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I'D PUT HER TO SLEEP I

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:28.498 region:rollup2
HAD TO CAREFULLY PUT HER IN THE

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:30.367 region:rollup2
CRIB.

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:32.168 region:rollup2
I HAVE WITH HER BLANKET AFTER

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:34.104 region:rollup2
SHE WAS ASLEEP.

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:36.139 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE YOU'D WAKE UP IN CRY

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:38.408 region:rollup2
AND CRY AND I THINK OF ALL OF

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:40.744 region:rollup2
THE WAYS MOTHERS AND FATHERS PUT

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:42.212 region:rollup2
THEIR KIDS TO SLEEP. FOR MANY OF

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:44.414 region:rollup2
I'M THERE'S A SPECIAL TOY

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:46.850 region:rollup2
THERE'S MUSIC OR WHATEVER IT IS

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:48.585 region:rollup2
THEY USE AND IT WITHIN A MOMENT

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:51.154 region:rollup2
TO BE TORN AWAY FROM YOUR MOTHER

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:53.256 region:rollup2
OR FATHER OR CAREGIVER.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:55.692 region:rollup2
AND BE LEFT ALONE WITHOUT ALL OF

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.860 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THOSE THINGS THAT SU TH

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:59.496 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:01.464 region:rollup2
I ALSO THINK ABOUT AS KIDS GET

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:03.032 region:rollup2
OLDER FOR SO MANY PARENTS RIGHT

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:04.267 region:rollup2
HERE IN THIS ROOM --

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:06.069 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GET TO SIXTH GRADE

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:08.538 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM GO OFF TO FOR THE

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME TO CAMP?

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:12.075 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL ON

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.010 region:rollup2
THEIR BAGS ARE PACKED IN YET

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:16.179 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE NERVOUS IN LETTERS

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:17.914 region:rollup2
ARE WRITTEN AND AND TEARS.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:19.048 region:rollup2
AND YET THEY KNOW THEIR PARENTS

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.550 region:rollup2
ARE COMING BACK IN THE GOING TO

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.818 region:rollup2
SEE A MENU AND IT'S VERY

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.653 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL.

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:25.855 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN TO THINK ABOUT HAVING

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:27.624 region:rollup2
A CHILD RIPPED AWAY FROM YOU AND

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:28.825 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:30.527 region:rollup2
SEE HIM AGAIN.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:32.495 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE YOUNG

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:34.430 region:rollup2
BABIES WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:36.900 region:rollup2
TO SPEAK YET HOPING THAT MAYBE

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:38.501 region:rollup2
THEY DID TAKE OF I FINGERPRINT

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.904 region:rollup2
SO THEY COULD BEREUNITED.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:42.872 region:rollup2
AND THEN AGAIN NOW TO SEE SOME

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:45.074 region:rollup2
OF THOSE REUNIONS AND JUST SEE

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:46.409 region:rollup2
THE SOBBING AND SOBBING AND NO

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:48.111 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:50.613 region:rollup2
SO WHICHEVER WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:52.749 region:rollup2
A POLICY WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.551 region:rollup2
POLICY IS NOT RIGHT AND WE HAVE

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:56.686 region:rollup2
TO DIG DEEP AND WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:57.821 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR HEARTS TO SAY THAT WE

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.589 region:rollup2
CAN DO BETTER.

01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:05.495 region:rollup2
WE CAN FIX WHAT IS NOT WRONG

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:09.032 region:rollup2

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:46.436 region:rollup2
MY GRANDPARENTS WE'RE IMMIGRANTS

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2

GRANDMOTHER CAME HERE.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.980 region:rollup2
AND SHE ESSENTIALLY AS A

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.581 region:rollup2
TEENAGER I CLEAN PEOPLE'S

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.517 region:rollup2
BATHROOMS --

MY AUNTIES --

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:05.655 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM WERE LOW PAID --

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.490 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE ASSISTANCE WHO WOULD

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:09.158 region:rollup2
BAY SOMEONE OR CHANGED NOW MORE

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:11.694 region:rollup2

THEIR PHYSICAL NEEDS MIGHT BE.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:15.732 region:rollup2
AND WHILE MY FAMILY.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:17.667 region:rollup2
WAS NEVER SPLIT UP BECAUSE OF

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:19.402 region:rollup2
DEPORTATION OR IMMIGRATION

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:21.671 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES UP MY HEART GOES

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:22.472 region:rollup2
OUT TO THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.172 region:rollup2
BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:24.374 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.242 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.077 region:rollup2
SCIENTIST TO KNOW THAT ANY

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:29.312 region:rollup2
SEPARATION FROM A CHILD CAN BE

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:31.781 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING YOU CAN HAVE

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:33.249 region:rollup2
LIFELONG IMPACTS FOR THEM.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:35.184 region:rollup2
I I NOTICED LIKE TO BE SEPARATED

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:37.420 region:rollup2
FROM FAMILY THOUGH WHILE IT WAS

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:38.988 region:rollup2
NOT RELATED TO IMMIGRATION --

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:41.190 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I LOST

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:42.258 region:rollup2
MY FAMILY AND AT A VERY EARLY

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.760 region:rollup2
AGE -- WHEN

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:45.595 region:rollup2
I WAS SIX YEARS OLD I LOST MY

MOTHER TO CANCER MY FATHER WAS

01:07:45.595 --> 01:07:51.000 region:rollup2
NOT IN MY LIFE?

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:52.468 region:rollup2
AND I GOT SENT [inaudible] TO

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.636 region:rollup2
FOR AND I DO NOT SEE MOST OF MY

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:55.238 region:rollup2
SIBLINGS FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS.

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2

I WAS SENT TO LIVE WITH WAS A

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.811 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER --

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:03.646 region:rollup2
ALBEIT A COUSIN WHO I NEVER MET

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:05.448 region:rollup2
TO I SHOWED UP ON HER DOORSTEP

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:07.183 region:rollup2
IT WAS STILL DIFFICULT.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:08.818 region:rollup2
IT WAS DIFFICULT AS A CHILD TO

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:09.886 region:rollup2
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR MOTHER

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.754 region:rollup2
IS NOT COMING BACK TO NOT

01:08:09.886 --> 01:08:13.289 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE TO NOT

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:15.058 region:rollup2

TAKING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:22.111 region:rollup2

WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN.

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:10.152 region:rollup2

UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.398 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE TRYING

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.868 region:rollup2
TO FLEE TO SAVE THE LIVES.

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:27.536 region:rollup2

LAST NIGHT WITH MY WIFE --

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.774 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN US AWHILE BUT

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.943 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SHOWS THAT WE WATCHES

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:36.378 region:rollup2
HANDMAID'S TALE AND AND AND

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:37.913 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE MADE YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:39.481 region:rollup2
HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT.

01:23:37.913 --> 01:23:41.016 region:rollup2
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER ON THIS

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:42.284 region:rollup2
FLOOR I'M MAYBE POTENTIAL

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.253 region:rollup2
PARALLELS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:46.622 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DIFFICULT WAS THAT IN

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:47.422 region:rollup2
THIS LAST EPISODE WAS UP EPISODE

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:48.023 region:rollup2
ELEVEN IT'S ENOUGH THICKNESS

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:48.724 region:rollup2
WHILE BECAUSE OF HOW HEAVY THE

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:51.159 region:rollup2
SHOW IS --

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:53.395 region:rollup2
WAS THE MAIN AUTHOR OF THE MAIN

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.897 region:rollup2
CHARACTER WAS GOT A MOMENT TO

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:57.1000 region:rollup2
SEE HER CHILD WHO HAD SHE HAD

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:59.835 region:rollup2
BEEN TURNED OUT TORN AWAY FROM.

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:01.570 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT MOMENT THE CHILD

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:02.437 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS HER MOTHER

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.672 region:rollup2
BUT WAS STILL SCARED OF HER

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:06.775 region:rollup2
MOTHER -- IT

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:08.543 region:rollup2
SEEMS BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:10.279 region:rollup2
WASN'T SCARED OF HER MOTHER.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:11.647 region:rollup2
SHE WAS UPSET WITH HER MOTHER

01:24:10.279 --> 01:24:13.148 region:rollup2
AND MESSAGE WAS WHY DIDN'T YOU

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:14.950 region:rollup2
FIGHT HARDER.

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:17.152 region:rollup2
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY HARDER TO

01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:19.454 region:rollup2
FIND THE TO COME AFTER ME TO

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:20.956 region:rollup2
BRING ME BACK TO YOU INTO BACK

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:22.024 region:rollup2
TO DAD AND IT WAS BEYOND HER

01:24:20.956 --> 01:24:23.559 region:rollup2
CONTROL SHE'S A SLAVE?

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:25.761 region:rollup2
IT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL BUT

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:27.462 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE NOW PUTTING

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:28.063 region:rollup2
THESE KIDS.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.431 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE POSITION THAT WE'RE

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.866 region:rollup2
PUTTING THEM IN AND WE HAVE TO

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:32.234 region:rollup2
THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT THAT

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:33.335 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT BEING A

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:34.403 region:rollup2
DEMOCRAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT BEING

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:36.438 region:rollup2
A REPUBLICAN.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:38.106 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT BEING US AS HUMAN

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:40.309 region:rollup2
BEINGS AS AMERICANS AND WHAT WE

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:42.544 region:rollup2
STAND FOR AND WHAT IS VALUABLE

01:24:40.309 --> 01:24:42.744 region:rollup2
TO US AND WHETHER WE NOT WE WE

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:46.114 region:rollup2
VALUE.

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:47.249 region:rollup2
OUR HUMAN VALUES OR NOT AND I

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:48.684 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE ABOUT A

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:49.318 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:24:48.684 --> 01:24:50.953 region:rollup2
IT BECOMES ABOUT DEMOCRAT VERSUS

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:52.287 region:rollup2
REPUBLICAN.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:54.022 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.923 region:rollup2
A BALLOT SHOULD BE ABOUT WHO WE

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:56.959 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:58.794 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS RIGHT AS

01:24:56.959 --> 01:25:00.062 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS AS PARENTS AS

01:24:58.794 --> 01:25:02.164 region:rollup2
BROTHERS AND SISTERS SO ON AND

01:25:00.062 --> 01:25:02.864 region:rollup2
SO FORTH BECAUSE I DON'T CARE IF

01:25:02.164 --> 01:25:04.766 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IS A DIFFERENT

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:06.101 region:rollup2
POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THAN ME.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.269 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IN SOMEBODY BECAUSE

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:08.537 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AMERICAN I KNOW THAT

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:10.272 region:rollup2
DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF A WE MAY

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:12.174 region:rollup2
DISAGREE POLITICALLY WE STILL

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:14.109 region:rollup2
SHARE THE SAME VALUES AS TO WHAT

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.876 region:rollup2
IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.478 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS RESOLUTION

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:18.647 region:rollup2
IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT RESIDENT

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:20.382 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT SHOWING THAT OUR

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:22.084 region:rollup2
VOICE AS THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:25:20.382 --> 01:25:24.019 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AS A REALLY

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:25.387 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STATE TO THIS.

01:25:24.019 --> 01:25:26.588 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ECONOMY AND TO THIS

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:28.190 region:rollup2
NATION.

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:30.359 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:31.760 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT IS INHUMANE BECAUSE

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:33.562 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD DISTANT RATIONALES US

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.897 region:rollup2
WHY THIS POLICY EXISTS EITHER

01:25:33.562 --> 01:25:37.566 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE USED

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:39.601 region:rollup2
AS LEVERAGE TO TRY TO GET SOME

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:40.202 region:rollup2
I'M I'M AT THE OTHER POLITICAL

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.737 region:rollup2
SIDE TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:43.372 region:rollup2
WANT -- OR

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:45.040 region:rollup2
ITS TO DETER OTHER PEOPLE FROM

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:46.541 region:rollup2
COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.477 region:rollup2
BOTH AT RATIONALIZATIONS ARE IN

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.945 region:rollup2
HUMANE BOTH ARE WRONG.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:51.113 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.

01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:52.247 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS

01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:53.248 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A PARTISAN ISSUE

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:55.817 region:rollup2
THIS JUST NEEDS TO BE ABOUT AN

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:56.818 region:rollup2
ISSUE ARE WERE INDIVIDUALS NOT

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:57.819 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS THAT ARE LABELED

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.854 region:rollup2
WITH THE DEER ON OUR THAT'S NOT

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.454 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:01.223 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WHERE

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:02.624 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THAT WE CARE ABOUT

01:26:01.223 --> 01:26:03.592 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE FROM OTHER PLACES

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:06.228 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT SHOULD MATTER TO US

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:07.496 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HAS MATTER TO US

01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:08.430 region:rollup2
THATS WHY WERE THE GREATEST

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:09.498 region:rollup2
NATION IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:10.732 region:rollup2
OUR NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND WE

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:13.101 region:rollup2
SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT.

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:13.702 region:rollup2
SO I REALLY THINK THE AUTHOR UP

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:15.404 region:rollup2

THOSE NINE MONTHS.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:43.138 region:rollup2
THAT MY FATHER WAS DETAINED THAT

THAT CHRISTMAS.

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:00.889 region:rollup2
OF NOT HAVING OUR FATHER THERE

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:03.058 region:rollup2
WAS OF THE FACT I REMEMBER.

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:04.492 region:rollup2
THAT DUSTY OLD COUCH WHERE I WAS

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:06.194 region:rollup2
SITTING AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE WHILE

LUNGS.

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:20.775 region:rollup2
NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT THAT

WAS GONNA COME BACK OR NOT NOT.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:26.081 region:rollup2
CARING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:28.483 region:rollup2

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:54.102 region:rollup2
LOSING YOUR PARENT TO A

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:56.037 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT IS DEFINED.

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:58.173 region:rollup2
BY A FENCE [inaudible]

01:32:56.037 --> 01:33:00.041 region:rollup2

01:32:58.173 --> 01:33:02.877 region:rollup2

AND THE EMOTIONAL.

01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:15.190 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF ALL THAT I I

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:17.792 region:rollup2
THOUGHT I'D RISE TO SHARE THAT

01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:18.092 region:rollup2

RIGHT.

01:33:29.137 --> 01:33:32.173 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THERE'S A

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:33.908 region:rollup2
LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM ALL OF

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:35.977 region:rollup2

ANTI TRUMP THIS IS ANTI A POLICY

01:35:46.341 --> 01:35:49.644 region:rollup2
A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THAT

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:51.179 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ALIGN ITSELF.

01:35:49.644 --> 01:35:54.983 region:rollup2
WITH OUR COUNTRY.

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:56.584 region:rollup2
AND IN PRACTICE IS NOT FEASIBLE.

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:58.219 region:rollup2
AS A WAY TO ENACT IMMIGRATION

01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:00.755 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:35:58.219 --> 01:36:02.123 region:rollup2

AND I DON'T WANNA PUT MY

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:13.368 region:rollup2
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN A BAD

AN ADD ON TO MAKE THIS A TRULY

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:31.452 region:rollup2
BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION.

01:36:29.684 --> 01:36:33.054 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN REALITY THE VERY

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:34.222 region:rollup2
SIMPLE FACT OF HAVING AN

01:36:33.054 --> 01:36:36.257 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT SAYS

01:36:34.222 --> 01:36:38.226 region:rollup2
ZERO TOLERANCE.

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:39.761 region:rollup2
CUTS OFF A VERY LEGAL PRACTICE

01:36:38.226 --> 01:36:40.495 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF PEOPLE FLEEING

01:36:39.761 --> 01:36:42.430 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:44.465 region:rollup2
WAR TORN COUNTRIES.

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.600 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN WE CREATED

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:47.101 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION BY WHICH THEY HAVE

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.302 region:rollup2

A PRACTICE THAT HAS.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:56.811 region:rollup2
BEEN ACCEPTED FOR GENERATIONS.

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:58.513 region:rollup2
AND A PULL PEOPLE EN IMAGEN PART

01:36:56.811 --> 01:37:00.214 region:rollup2
OF AMERICA.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:02.116 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:04.419 region:rollup2
THESE PARENTS WITHOUT

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:06.087 region:rollup2
INCARCERATING THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

01:37:04.419 --> 01:37:07.121 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AND I

01:37:06.087 --> 01:37:09.090 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN ONLY DO BETTER IF

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:10.224 region:rollup2
