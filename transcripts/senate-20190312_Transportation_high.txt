THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOUR INDULGENCE TO ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY HERE BEFORE YOU AND THE COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE I AM INDEED CHAIR IN THE CAL IT'S COMMITTEE AND IT TOOK A LITTLE BREAK FOR LUNCH SO HOPEFULLY. I'LL BE BACK WITH THEM IN GOOD TIME TO FINISH UP. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SENATORS AND MEMBERS SALAS -- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY AND FOR ACCOMMODATING AGAIN MY SCHEDULE. AS YOU KNOW IN EARLY JANUARY GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM APPOINTED ME TO LEAD. A DMB STRIKE TEAM THE GOAL OF WHICH WAS TO REINVENT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THE STRIKE TEAM WAS GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO BEGIN. THIS WORK AND WHILE WE ALL KNOW THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WILL TAKE LONGER I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS DONE IN ITS FIRST WEEKS. AND WHERE WE ARE HEADED. I BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS THE DMB WILL BE ON A PATH OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND INDEED REINVENTION. FIRST LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE MISSION OF THE STRIKE TEAM IS WE WANT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE DMV OF THE FUTURE. THE STRIKE TEAMS OBJECTIVE IS TO BEGIN THE WORK OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND REINVENTION FOR THIS IMPORTANT PUBLIC FACING STATE AGENCY. IN ORDER TO CREATE THE DMV OF THE FUTURE THE STRIKE TEAM IS ALREADY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS DELIVERING SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE WAY THEY WANT THEM. EASY AFFECTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE. WE ALL KNOW THE DMB IS GRAPPLING WITH TO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES REAL ID AND MOTOR VOTER. REAL ID HAS A FAST APPROACHING DEADLINE EVERY CALIFORNIANS WHO NEEDS TO FLY OR ENTER A SECURE FEDERAL FACILITY OR MILITARY BASE. AND DOES NOT HAVE A VALID PASSPORT MUST HAVE A REAL ID BY OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY GETTING A REAL ID REQUIRES A VISIT TO A DMV FIELD OFFICE AND WHILE THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT VISIT WE ARE ALREADY WORKING ON SEVERAL EFFORTS WHICH I WILL DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT. TO GET AS MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO KNEW OR THE DEADLINE WITHOUT INCREASING FIELD OFFICE WAIT TIMES. MOTOR VOTER IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE WE BELIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES ARE WITHIN REACH AS THE DMB IMPROVES ITS TRAINING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY. AS WITH ANYTHING ONE CHANGE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THERE NEEDS TO ME MANY SILVER POINTS THE STRIKE TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING ON A SERIES OF ACTIONS TOGETHER. I BELIEVE WHICH WILL BRING NEW WAYS OF OPERATING BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY TO THE DMV. THESE MAY START WITH ONE FOCUS BUT WILL THEN BE ABLE TO BE CARRIED THROUGH ALL CORNERS OF THE ORGANIZATION. THE FIRST ACTION OF THE STRIKE TEAM WAS TO MEET WITH SENIOR LEADERS OF THE DMV TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR WORK AND THEIR CHALLENGES. WE ALSO CREATED AN ONLINE INTAKE FORM. EXCUSE ME ON THE GOV UPS WEBSITE FOR DIEM BE EMPLOYEES AND ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO AT THEIR DISCRETION PROVIDE INPUT AND SHARE IDEAS WITH THE STRIKE TEAM. WE'VE BEEN GATHERING THAT INFORMATION AND PASSING ON TO THE DMV WHERE APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THE STRIKE TEAM ALSO REVIEWED THE DEPARTMENT'S IT CAPACITY TO ASSESS THE READINESS OF THE DMV'S ENVIRONMENT TO SUCCESSFULLY MODERNIZE THEIR DELIVERY OF SERVICES. THE STRIKE TEAM IS STARTING THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT TO BUILD A CULTURE OF EMPLOYEE EMPOWERED CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS WILL INCLUDE BUILDING THE IT CAPACITY WITH AN EMPHASIS ON HUMAN AND TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOCUSED ON SERVICE DELIVERY. SECURITY AND RELIABILITY. WE WERE ALSO CONFRONTED WITH SEVERAL VACANCIES AND I'M PLEASED THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOME APPOINTED KATHLEEN WEB AS THE ACTING DIRECTOR YOU WILL HEAR FROM HER SHORTLY. KATHLEEN WAS THE DIRECTOR OF PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT AT GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY AND HAS A RICH BACKGROUND IN RISK MANAGEMENT LEAN PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE STRIKE TEAM THAT THE STRIKE TEAM IS ACTION ORIENTED WE HAVE HAD MANY MEETINGS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND ARE NOW CREATING RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS. I'M GONNA START WITH CREDIT CARDS IN THE FIELD OFFICES SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR SPOKE ABOUT IN HIS BUDGET ROLLOUT. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR NO SENSE THAT IN AN ERA WHERE I CAN USE MY CREDIT CARD. AT A GIRL SCOUT COOKIE BOOTH BUT I CAN'T USE IT A DMV FIELD OFFICE. TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE WE'VE HAD MANY MEETINGS BOTH WITH OUTSIDE ENTITIES AND WITH THE DMV TEAM AND BELIEVE THE ISSUES THAT PREVIOUSLY SEEMED TO BLOCK THIS ACTION. ARE NOT OBSTACLES THAT WE CAN'T OVERCOME WE ARE LOOKING ON A PATH WE ARE WORKING ON A PATH FORWARD AND EXPECT THE GOVERNOR'S CHARGE. OF HAVING A CREDIT CARD OR CREDIT CARD USE IN THE FIELD OFFICES BY THE END OF THE YEAR TO BE REALIZED. ONE OF OUR KEY EFFORTS IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICES IF THEY DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. THAT MEANS INCREASING THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT A DMB BUSINESS AT OTHER LOCATIONS WHETHER IT IS ONLINE OR AT A KIOSK OR WITH A BUSINESS PARTNER. WE KNOW IN TODAY'S WORLD THE FIRST PLACE PEOPLE GO TO GET INFORMATION IS THE INTERNET. THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DMV WEBSITE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN EASILY FIND THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. SOME IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE LAST SUMMER BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE WE LEARNED THAT THE DMV WEBSITE HAS ELEVEN THOUSAND PAGES. THAT'S HARDLY USER FRIENDLY. A FULL WEBSITE OVER OVER HALL WILL TAKE TIME BUT WE ARE WORKING ON SHORT SHORT TERM IMPROVEMENTS. IF YOU CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON A WEBSITE THE NEXT STEP IS YOU PICK UP THE PHONE. WELL THAT EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO BEEN FRUSTRATING TO DMB CUSTOMERS THE STRIKE TEAM BROUGHT IN THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF DMV'S CALL CENTER PRACTICES. AND SHARED BEST PRACTICES FTD STAFF. HAVE YOU EVALUATED THE PROCESSES OF THE SACRAMENTO'S CALL CENTER AND HAD HAVE VISITS SCHEDULED THIS MONTH TO THE RIVER SIDE IN THE FRESNO FACILITIES. THESE REVIEW AND SHARED -- SEIZURES WILL HELP THE DMV IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS AND LOWER HOLD TIMES ADDITIONALLY WE HOPE TO ADD MORE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS CHAT BOTS LIVE CHAT. AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO PROCESS MORE RE TREAT ROUTINE TRANSACTIONS BY THE TELEPHONE TREND -- TECHNICIANS. IN ADDITION WE ARE PLANNING TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF SELF SERVICE TERMINALS OR KIOSKS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND ADDING NEW SERVICES TO THOSE KIOSKS THE FIRST FIX IS TO ADD MORE LANGUAGES TO THE KIOSK WHICH WAS PLANNED PREVIOUSLY -- TO THE STRIKE TEAM WE ALSO HOPE TO ADD A HUNDRED SELF SERVICE TERMINALS AT KEY LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY THIS SUMMER AND ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED BY THE END OF THE YEAR CURRENTLY KIOSKS PROCESS VEHICLE REGISTRATION RENEWALS BUT WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THEY DOOM MANY MORE FUNCTIONS AND OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY. OF CHAOS TO ISSUE A REPLACEMENT DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD SAVE THOUSANDS OF VISITS. TO THE FIELD OFFICES AS OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO CALIFORNIANS LOSE THEIR LICENSES ANNUALLY AND HAVE TO GO INTO A FIELD OFFICE. TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT AS I HAVE SAID ONE OF OUR MAIN GOALS IS TO REDUCE AVOIDABLE VISITS TO THE FIELD OFFICE AS PART OF THE STRATEGY THE STRIKE TEAM IS WORKING WITH A PILOT TO BRING THE DMV TO MAJOR COMPANIES. IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES GET A REAL ID THIS POP UP DMV IDEA IS DESIGNED TO HELP OUR STATE'S BUSINESS TRAVELERS. WITH ADVANCE NOTICE AND COORDINATION EMPLOYERS COULD PREPARE EMPLOYEES TO PULL TOGETHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS AND BRING THEM TO WORK ON A DESIGNATED DAY ENABLING THEM PLACE TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PROCESS. AT THEIR WORK LOCATION WE HAVE THE FIRST PILOT SCHEDULED FOR THE FIRST WEEK IN APRIL AND IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL WE HOPE TO HAVE MANY MORE THAT ARE LARGE CORPORATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO EXAMINE THE COMMUNICATIONS AROUND RELY DE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE COMING TO FIELD OFFICES FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DOCUMENTATION THAT THEY NEED AND THAT EVERYONE WHO FILES KNOWS THAT. THEY SHOULD ANY WHEN THAT FLIES KNOWS. TWENTY TWENTY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A VALID PASSPORT. THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE ROLLING OUT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCES WITH THE DMV BUT AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING. ON OF OUR OF OUR TESTIMONY OUR GOAL IS NOT TO IMPROVE WAIT TIMES AND MOVE ON WE BELIEVE THERE MUST BE A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE IN HOW DMB WORKS. THE STRIKE TEAM IS STARTING WITH PROCESSES SURROUNDING REAL ID WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THESE CONVENTICLES BANDED TO OTHER KEY DMV FUNCTIONS. AT THE STRIKE TEAMS REQUEST THE DMV HAS ISSUED A REQUEST FOR OFFER OUR F. O. FOR CONSULTING SERVICES WITH THE GOAL OF STREAMLINING THE ISSUANCE OF RELY DIS. BASED ON USER RESEARCH THE CONSULTANT WILL UNDERTAKE A SERIES OF DESIGNS SPRINTS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING COMMUNICATIONS AROUND REAL ID IMPROVING TRAINING TO PREPARE FIELD OFFICE TECHNICIANS AND DEVELOPING BETTER FIELD CUSTOMER SERVICE FLOW. IN EACH SPRINT THE CONSULTANT WILL ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENT IDEAS THAN PLAN AND PROTOTYPE NEW APPROACHES FOR IMPROVED RESULTS THE CONSULTANT WORKING WITH DIEM THE STAFF WILL INTEGRATE LEARNINGS FROM THE SPRINTS. INTO A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR MEETING GREATER DEMAND FOR REAL ID'S WITHOUT INCREASING WAIT TIMES. THIS FIVE MONTH CONTRACT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN THIS MONTH AND WE EXPECT IT TO DELIVER RESULTS STARTING IN JUNE. I HOPE THAT THIS IS GIVING YOU AN IDEA OF THE WORK THE STRIKE TEAM HAS UNDERTAKEN WELL WE ARE LESS THAN TEN WEEKS IN. I BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS PROGRESS AND I AND WE ARE ON A PATH TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AND BEGIN THE WORK. OF INDEED THE DMV OF THE FUTURE AND OF COURSE MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M VERY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU AND THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU WE HADN'T A FEW MEMBERS -- ARRIVE. THANK YOU. FOR SPENDING SOMETIME I I WHEN -- WE LOOK AT THE DMV AND COMPARES TO OTHER STATES. WE SEE THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING THINGS THAT WE DON'T DO. AS BECAUSE IT'S NEVER BEEN -- LOOK THERE ARE IN THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE STRIKE TEAM. SO. I TAKE THE JOB. WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER STATES I SEE THINGS LIKE MULTI YEAR REGISTRATION? OF REGISTRATION AT THE SMOG CHECK LOCATIONS SO. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE KEYS THE SHOES SOCKS AT WHATEVER THE SCHOOLS UNIVERSITIES. THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES ARE YOU ARE YOU -- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE BIGGER? YOU KNOW LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL HERE IN SOME CASES -- ON TECHNOLOGY OR HOW DO YOU SAY -- GOOD IDEAS OTHER STATES ARE USING. EFFECTIVE IDEAS SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE IS LOOKING PROMISING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE CONSOLE LOOK INTO. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE -- LOOKED EXTENSIVELY IN MANY STATES THERE SOME GREAT EXAMPLES INDIANA IS ONE NEW YORK IS ONE HAWAII COLORADO FLORIDA. AND THE A LOT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. MANY OF THE SAME VENDORS THAT SERVICE CALIFORNIA DMV ALSO PROVIDES SERVICES TO THOSE DMV'S I'LL TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE KIOSK VENDOR -- I TI THEY SERVICE -- INDIANA HAWAIIAN COLORADO SO WE'VE MET WITH THEM. SEVERAL TIMES AND AND HAVE JUST OFFER KNOWING WHAT THEY OFFER BY GOING ON THE WEBSITE TO THE OF THE STATE'S AND INDEED WE HAVE EVEN I'VE EVEN BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH -- INDIANA -- AND IT THERE WE ARE INVESTIGATING AND CERTAINLY AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY WILL -- HOPEFULLY HAVE EIGHT EXTENSIVE MORE SERVICES AT ON OUR CHAOS JUST AS THEY DO AN INDIAN AND THE OTHER STATES. YOU'RE RIGHT IN IN INDIANA THEY MOVED -- VEHICLE REGISTRATION OUT OF THEIR FIELD OFFICES QUITE SOMETIME AGO AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME AT SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT STRIKING. THEIR LONGER TERM IN OPERATIONAL CHANGES. BUT IF WE COULD AS I MENTIONED IF WE COULD JUST HAVE A REPLACEMENT OF DRIVER'S LICENSES DONE THROUGH THE KIOSK -- ONLINE WHICH THEY DO IN OTHER STATES THAT WOULD KEEP A MILLION -- FOLKS OUT OF THE DMV FIELD OFFICES ANNUALLY. SO THERE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT STATES ARE DOING WITH REAL ID TO I WILL SAY MANY ARE STRUGGLING ARE SEEN CHALLENGES AS WE ARE OUR VOLUME OF COURSE IS MUCH LARGER THAN MOST STATES. BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN FROM SOME OF THE THINGS AND HAVE -- THAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE AREAS OF MARKETING AND COMMUNICATING MORE THOROUGHLY SOMERS LAST LAST FALL I BROUGHT UP THE MALL TO YOUR REGISTRATION -- I I BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN TODAY HOUSE THAT BEING LOOKED ON SIR I'M GOING TO ASK THAT -- THE ACTING DIRECTOR KATHLEEN WEB ADDRESS. AGAIN THAT'S MORE OF I THINK AN OPERATIONAL ISSUE -- BUT CERTAINLY THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT OKAY -- WE ALSO WE ALSO -- FIND THAT -- SOME OF OUR TECHNOLOGY -- LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SHORT TERM O SAYS YOU CAN DO BUT REALLY LONG TERM THE TECHNOLOGY IS PRETTY ANTIQUATED THE DMV -- CAN YOU GIVE US SORT OF OVERVIEW OF HOW WE CAN HAVE A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGY. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S YOUR VISION. TO GO LONG TERM SAY WE'RE WORKING ON A FIVE YEAR TIME CYCLE -- TO GETTING PASTOR REAL ID PERIOD AND RUNNING -- DESERTION TEAM THANK YOU THE STRIKE TEAM -- UNDERTOOK A COMPLETE PORTFOLIO REVIEW OF THE I. T. PROCESSES AT DMV CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. AND IN THAT WE LEARNED THAT AS YOU WELL KNOW -- THERE IS INSTABILITY -- AND IN IN THE IN THE STACK IF YOU WILL FROM THE DMV A DATABASE THROUGH AN UP TO THE FRONT INTERIOR OF TECHNOLOGY AND THAT STACK I NEEDS TO BE STABILIZED. AND WE WILL BE UNDERTAKING -- IMMEDIATELY -- THE THE MIDDLE TIER IF I MAY DESCRIBE IT THAT WAY IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE PROPRIETARY. NATURE OF OF THE CODE WORK THIS -- EXISTED OVER THE YEARS NEEDS TO BE STABILIZED IMMEDIATELY AND THE STRIKE TEAM -- WORKING WITH THIS CD T. N. DMV WILL BE UNDERTAKING THAT RIGHT AWAY SO THEN YOU CAN. LOOK AT MORE MODERNIZING OF TECHNOLOGY PROCESSES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT I THINK WAS A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR A LONG TIME AT THE DMV. FOR CREDIT CARD USE IN THE FIELD OFFICES. WAS ON SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE FIELD OFFICES AND HEADQUARTERS AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT THE I. T. SYSTEMS COULD. PROPERLY DO RECONCILIATION IN REAL TIME OR EVEN ONCE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS MOST OF THAT KIND OF WORK TODAY IS DONE MY CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES. SO IF WE CAN AND I HAVE MET. WITH ALMOST ALL OF CAN ASSURE YOU -- IF WE CAN OFF LOAD THAT RISK IF YOU WILL AS MAJOR RETAILERS DUE. TO THE CARD PROCESS TRULY ARE GOING THROUGH A REVOLUTION OF THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THEIR ADOPTING EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SQUARE YOU HAVE SO MANY CUTTING EDGE -- COMPANIES THAT EXISTS THAT CAN TAKE THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES AND THE RECONCILIATION ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR DMV I THINK WE CAN. OFF LOAD THAT RISK TO THE CARD PROCESSING COMPANIES. THE AND WE'RE REALLY WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW THE KIND OF THINGS -- YOU MIGHT HAVE A GIRL SCOUT ON YOUR STRIKE TEAM. IT'S LIKE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THERE'S NO KNOWS NO AGE RULE RIGHT GIRL SCOUT LEADER YEAH WELL THERE WE GO WE GOT TO HAVE -- WE'LL GET SOME OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE THEY PROBABLY WOULD KNOW HOW TO DO THIS -- AND HUESO SO I I TAKE -- OF ONE OF ONE OF THE HERE IS THE LEGISLATURE. PAYS A LOT ATTENTION TO ON ON OUR SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC. IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE -- WITH LANGUAGE ISSUES OR DISABILITIES OR ARE ELDERLY -- ARE TREATED -- WELL [inaudible] AND PROBABLY MORE THAN WELL WE WANT TO TREAT THEM WITH EXTRA RESPECT. AND I I THINK THE STRIKE TEAM SHOULD LOOK AT HOW WE PROVIDE SERVICES BETTER FOR THOSE. THOSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE -- HER THAT HAVE OUR LANGUAGE ISSUES SO. AND YOU TALKED ABOUT GOING TO THE COMPANY'S -- TO DO THE REGISTRATION YOU CAN PROBABLY LOOK AT SOME KIND OF WAY OF GOING TO THE SENIOR CENTERS. OF WHERE THE SENIORS ARE SERIF THERE'S SENIOR HOUSING -- PROGRAMS. FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE DISABILITIES THAT WANT TO TRAVEL -- AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. THAT ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN TERMS OF PROCESSING. OF THESE APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSES WITHOUT SOME ASSISTANCE SO. I THINK -- I THINK DOES. I ALWAYS HAVE TO BRING THAT UP IT'S KIND OF MY A YOU KNOW TWELVE YEARS AS A THIRTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN -- OF I CONSERVE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT. IN RAISING THE ISSUE FOR THE DISABLED. ABOUT TREATMENT BY THE GOVERNMENTAL SERVICES WITH A VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- ISSUES SO I I APPRECIATE YOU BROUGHT IT UP AGAIN TODAY THERE ARE CONTINUE TO BRING IT UP AS LONG AS I AM -- LEGISLATOR I I THINK THAT -- I THINK THAT -- THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE THE DMV DOES -- I FOUND OUT. I KNOW THE MEMBERS KNOW THIS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS OF THE PENAL CODE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ACTUALLY PUNISH PEOPLE BY TAKING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE AWAY FROM THEM. IF THEY'RE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN CRIMES ARE ALLOWED JUDGES TO DO THAT [inaudible] AND I THINK. PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR CRIME AND HAVING -- CONVICTED IF THEY'RE GUILTY IS IMPORTANT. I THINK PUNISH THEM BY TAKING AWAY THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. IS A IS A WAY OF JUST MAKING OR DMV HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. SO I THINK -- I BETTER DO SOME BILLS ON NOT CHANGING THAT AND MAYBE. ST WELL WILL YOU KNOW WITHOUT CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE PENAL CODE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A MISDEMEANOR PHONE OR ANY OF THAT KIND OF STUFF. WHICH IS SAYING. WE DON'T WANT TO USE THE PENAL CODE. AND AND AND AND ALLOW THE DMV TO BE BURDEN WITH US. IMPLEMENTING THE PENAL CODE I DON'T KNOW WITH PEOPLE. HAVE EVEN NOTICE THIS ISSUE BUT BUT I FOUND THAT. IT'S LITERALLY IN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE THIS PROCESS -- AS PART OF THEIR PUNISHMENT WHEN THEY COMMIT A CRIME WHETHER IT'S A MISDEMEANOR OR SOME OTHER KIND OF CRIME. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DO YOU -- OR ANYTHING INVOLVING AN AUTOMOBILE. TALKING ABOUT NON AUTOMOBILE. BASIC CRIMES IN ON THAT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DRIVING A CAR USING A CAR AND HE THAT. THAT SERVICE THANKS SO. SO I THINK -- I THINK -- OF THOSE THOSE THINGS WILL BE LOOKED AT IN OUR LEGISLATION I LIKE YOUR COOPERATION WORKING ON THAT CERTAINLY. BECAUSE AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO WE HAVE TO STRIP AWAY SOME OF THE ADDED. ASSIGNMENTS OF YOU WANT TO CALL THAT THE SOCIAL SERVICE COLLECTION AGENCY -- LIKE THEY ONLY BECOME THAT WE COULD LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS RIGHT I AGREE -- AND I THINK THAT -- THEY REQUIRE MORE STAFF MORE TIME I THINK -- OF IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH NOW I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT I MEAN WE'RE REALISTICALLY MAKE THE DUTY OF THE FOCUS ON ITS. CORE MISSION. OF OF HELPING PEOPLE DRIVE SUCCESSFULLY IN GETTING THERE -- THAN ANY. FOR OUR TRAVEL THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THEM HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE ALL OVER THE WORLD SO. SO -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS -- SENATOR BATES IS HERE. INTERNAL -- JUST FINE NOW I'M. ACTUALLY OUT ON TO WHAT SENATOR BAIL SAID ABOUT CHILD ACCOMMODATING THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS PARTICULAR. I'M GONNA PUT A SHOUT OUT IN THERE FOR THE SENIOR COMMUNITY WHEN I GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE I WAS WITH A COUPLE SENIORS WHO WERE OUT THE THE COMPUTER ON STATIONS AND THEY WERE TOTALLY CONFUSED OF HOW TO FILL OUT. SO I MAYBE THEY'RE ALREADY ANSEL AND PAPER. THAT THE GENTLEMAN THAT STANDING NEXT TO ME HE JUST WALKED AWAY SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN I NEED TO GO TAKE A COMPUTER CLASS WAS. IN SO I TRIED TO HELP HIM THROUGH ON THAT BUT I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL BE FEW OF THOSE PROBABLY. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND MAYBE THERE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF EXPIRATION ESPECIALLY UP A SENIOR AGE. THE WORRY ABOUT WHETHER YOU'LL QUALIFY TO TO GET YOUR LICENSE RENEWED I THINK OF IN PARTICULAR ON A GROUP IN A LARGER GROUP POSSIBLY AS THE AS IT GOES HERE CALIFORNIA TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. CERTAINLY THAT KIANA KIOSK I'M ASSUMING THAT'S GOING TO BE MORE ON COMPUTER BASED THAT JOB. THE INTUITIVE YEAH PRETTY INTUITIVE AND TELL ME THE LOVELY MUCH MORE INTUITIVE THAN THE REAL ID MOTOR VOTER -- PROCESS WITH THAT YET OUT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND THEN THANK YOU WILL WORK WITH THE ACTING DIRECTOR WEB ON THAT. AND THEN ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS LIKE TRIPLE A THE I DON'T LOVES YES AND THEY DO HAVE FACILITIES THAT PROBABLY WOULD ACCOMMODATE THESE. OFFSITE LOCATIONS THEY DO AND I HAVE MET WITH BOTH THE NORTHERN CLUBS IN THE SOUTHERN CLUBS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE EAGER TO DO MORE WORK FRANKLY -- AND WE'RE EAGER TO HAVE MORE KIOSK AND THAT'S UNDER WAY WITH WITH THE STRIKE FORCE VERY GOOD WELL THANK YOU THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS THANK YOU SENATOR BATES -- I HAD A CONSTITUENT -- WHO IS? NINETY TWO WENT TO THE DAY IN THE OFFICE AND STOOD. FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS AND THEN LEFT BECAUSE SHE'S TOO TIRED. CALL ME UP AND YOU KNOW I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT INDIRECTLY AT AND HAVE FROM HER BUT SHE WHEN. SHE GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF THE BUT WITHOUT MY ASSISTANCE OF POINT OUT HOW. MY MOTHER. WELL SHE NEVER COMPLAINS ABOUT ANYTHING. SHE'S PROBABLY WATCHING US A LOVE YOU MAMA -- BUT BUT SHE'S ALWAYS WATCHING THIS ON TV AND EVERYTHING ALL THOSE ALL THOSE MEETINGS SHE MAKES COMMENTS ON ALL YOU PEOPLE. ALL THE MEMBERSHIPS THAT ONLY VERY KIND COMMENTS I WELL SHE SHE SHE SHE THE GROUP BOTH THE CORRECTION SHE MAKES TOWARDS MAYOR. PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD ME IN A MOMENT AND TEN KIDS. SO I GOT A POINT FROM HER TODAY BRINGING. BUT I TAKE -- I TAKE WORKING WITH THE SENIORS. IF THERE'S A GOOD WAY TO DO A AND AND THE CENTER AGENCIES ARE REALLY GOOD AT ANY KIND OF THING WE CAN DO TO ASSIST THE SENIORS. AND THEY DO IT AND ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT AREAS LIKE A HEALTH INSURANCE WE HAVE A WHOLE SYSTEM. FOR HEALTH INSURANCE TO GET THEM SIGNED UP -- FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AFTER THE THE MEDICARE SYSTEM. AND ALL OUT THERE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE THAT ASSISTANCE SENIORS AT THE SENIOR CENTER IS A SENIOR PROGRAMS. SO -- I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS IMPORTANT PRIORITY THAT WE WORK. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF RUDY -- SALAS SAYS OR OR CENTER NUMBER GO AHEAD. IT'S A RUDY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOU BEING HERE -- I TRY TO FOLLOW UP BECAUSE OF YOUR TESTIMONY TO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE STRIKE FORCE AND HAVING THE REPORT AND HOPEFULLY BY JUNE. YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED WEATHER'S FOR SENIORS ARE DISABLED YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO IN TERMS OF I THINK YOU MENTIONED LIKE THE ONLINE PRESENCE MAKING IT MORE ROBUST TO ME THAT MEANS. YOU KNOW LIKE VIRTUAL CHECK IN LINES YOU KNOW I CAN DO IT FOR MY HAIR CUT WHAT CAN I DO IT FOR DMV -- YOU KNOW MAYBE GETTING SOME ANSWERS THAT WAY BUT ALSO EVEN THE THE KIOSKS THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TRIPLE A I KNOW MY FATHER AS WELL USES TRIPLE A ALL THE TIME BECAUSE LIKE LOOK THERE'S NO LINE I CAN GET IT. IN AND OUT WITHIN THE HOUR. YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES WE'VE BEEN HEARING THROUGH THE BE. BUT WHAT I WANTED TO JUST ASK IS IT ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE PROCESS SEES I THINK IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC AND IT'S GREAT ESPECIALLY WITH. REAL LADY AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES WE'RE GONNA HAVE MOVING FORWARD. IS IN THAT REPORT HE HAS BEEN OUTLINED THE PROCESSES OF WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THESE THINGS ARE WILL. THE ADMINISTRATION JUST AUTOMATICALLY -- MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STRIKE FORCED SO LIKE YOU KNOW I CAN. AFTER THE REPORT COMES OUT MAYBE I CAN LOG IN AND DO THE VIRTUAL CHECK IN OR DO THE ONLINE CHAT IT. OR TRY TO DO ALL THE SERVICES THAT I NEED RIGHT AWAY OR THOSE THINGS YOU CAN ACT I WOULD IMAGINE THE MORE EXPENSIVE STUFF YOU COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO GET A BUDGET. ALLOCATION FOR IT BUT I'M JUST WONDERING FOR LIKE THE THIRD PARTY VENDORS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN THE CREDIT CARD USE. YOU KNOW ARE THOSE THINGS THAT THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY IMPLEMENT. NUMBER SALAS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- WHEN WE ARE ACTING AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IMMEDIATELY WE'RE NOT WRITING A REPORT THAT WILL THEN GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND THEN THEY'LL TAKE ACTION AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN? WE I MEET WEEKLY. AND ALMOST DAILY REPORT TO LAKE -- AND WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS IN REAL TIME SO IT WON'T WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR A REPORT THAT WE'RE GONNA RIGHT -- ADD THE POP UP A DMV THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT WE HAVE MADE A DECISION ABOUT AND WERE WORKING FOR THOSE KIOSKS -- WE MADE A DECISION THAT WE NEEDED A HUNDRED MORE IN THE FIELD THERE THERE I'M GOING TO BE IN THE FIELD NOW AFTER THE BUDGET. IS APPROVED HOPEFULLY -- THERE WILL BE -- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN APPROPRIATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PUT A HUNDRED MORE IN THE FIELD. BY THE END OF THE YEAR BUT TO FULLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE -- RECOMMENDING ON A REGULAR BASIS IN REAL TIME AS A STRIKE TEAM WILL INDEED TAKE -- APPROPRIATION AND WILL INDEED TAKE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION BUT SOME ARE NOT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW LIKE I MENTIONED THE REQUEST FOR OFFER THAT WE PUT OUT ON THE STREET. THREE WEEKS AGO HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED -- A VENDOR WITH WHO WILL START NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S ON A READ -- PROCESS RE ENGINEERING OF A FIELD ASSESSES BUT FROM THOSE PROCESSES WE WILL THEN -- RE ENGINEERED FIELD OFFICES -- FOR A BETTER FASTER -- METHOD OF PROCESSING ID'S AND DEALS THE DRIVER'S LICENSE SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TAKING ACTION RIGHT AWAY. AND YES SOME OF THE ACTION WILL NEED -- WILL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN RECOMMENDATION. TO YOU ALL THROUGH THE APPROPRIATION PROCESS. BUT SOME WERE UNDERTAKING RIGHT AWAY RIGHT NOW OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK THAT WE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW WANT TO IDENTIFY AN ISSUE THAT. AND YOU SEE -- POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS SOMETHING TO HELP WITH THE WAIT TIMES AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU GUYS ARE MOVING ON THAT'LL BE NICE AT LEAST MOVING ON AND THEN I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD ASK YOU WERE BABY THE DECKS PANEL. BUT IN TERMS OF THE THIRD PARTY PROCESSORS LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT TRIPLE A BUT HE DOES HAVE YOU GUYS LOOK AT MAYBE EVEN EXPANDING THAT TO OTHER -- GOVERNMENT OFFICES OR LIKE SAY TO THE LIBRARIES OF THE KIOSK FOR INSTANCE WORKS FANTASTIC. MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED TO GO TO THE DMV BUT MAYBE YOU FIND IT IN ANOTHER COUNTY OR CITY. OFTEN LOOKING SIR IT PUTTING THE KIOSKS AND OTHER TO RETHINK OR SINK MORE THOROUGHLY OR MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE USED TO PLACE THE A KIOSK BECAUSE OF BETTER IN THE FIELD NOW. AND WE ARE DOING THAT SO SOME OF THEM AND THEY WERE VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL IN AS YOU HAVE BEEN I'M SURE NOW YOU SOME OF THOSE ARE IN GROCERY STORES. AND SOME OF THE BEST LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY NEAR DMV OFFICES SO YES WE'RE LOOKING AT THE METHODOLOGIES OF PLACEMENT OF KIOSKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING. THE BEST VALUE OUT OF THEM AND AS I SAID I'VE MET WITH THE AUTO CLUB'S AND THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING MORE KIOSKS AND ALSO IN THE WALL SERVICES -- SAID LIKE THE ATM THAT WE'RE ALL USED TO USING -- SO WE'RE EXPLORING THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR NUMBER COMMON MODE. THANK YOU MISTER OF DISPATCHER FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR TAKING ON THIS CHALLENGE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE DIFFICULT OR CHALLENGING SITUATIONS OR THANKLESS. CHALLENGES THAN THE ONE YOU'VE ACCEPTED -- COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE YOU TRIED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT DMV -- I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY -- I AM. NO I HAVE NOT NOT NOT AT THAT ONE OF THE FIELD OFFICES I HAVE. CERTAINLY IT SINCE I'VE TAKEN ON THIS. ASSIGNMENT I'VE TALKED. TO I WANT TO SAY HUNDREDS MAYBE IT'S ON HUNDREDS BUT SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE I'VE HEARD THE EXPERIENCES WE WITNESSED THEM IN SOME OF THE FIELD OFFICES IS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SO AND I I THINK I HAVE A THIS IS LIKE. BUT AND I'LL SPARE YOU MIGHT PERSONALLY IN ADULTS WITH ANECDOTES OF FOLKS HAVE COME TO US -- LET ME JUST ENCOURAGE YOU EVERY SIX MONTHS OR SO AS A METHOD OF QUALITY CONTROL JUST TO TRY TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND THEN IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL ACTUALLY SHOWING UP FOR THAT APPOINTMENT IN AND I REALIZE THAT THIS. INCREDIBLY TIME CONSUMING BUT I THINK IT MAY GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AND WHAT FRUSTRATIONS ARE BEING FELT BY THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN. I DO THIS WITH OTHER AGENCIES AS WELLJUST AS A YOU KNOW JOHN Q. WERE TOM Q. CITIZEN TRIED TO DO THAT -- INSTANCE THERE'S GOING TO BE IMPROVEMENTS HERE THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS MAY BE AN INTERESTING WAY FOR YOU TO PERSONALLY EXPERIENCE THE PROGRESS THAT THAT WILL BE MADE JUST JUST A THOUGHT. NO I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD THOUGHT -- I HAVE ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STRIKE TEAM ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WORKS AT GOV OPTION IS A MEMBER OF THE STRIKE TEAM. SHE DID -- LAST WEEK I BELIEVE IT WAS HE MADE AN APPOINTMENT SHE MADE THEY MIGHT POINT IN SEVERAL WEEKS AGO BUT SHE WENT.

AS THE NEW ACTING DIRECTOR I AM EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MODERNIZE THE DMV OPERATIONS TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. AS SECRETARY BADGER STATE IN HER OPENING REMARKS THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS. FOCUSED UPON DELIVERING SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO RECEIVE THEM. AS I SURE WAS STAFF WE ARE ON A JOURNEY TO CREATE THE DMV THE BEST SERVICE OUR CHILDREN AND THIS WILL REQUIRE A COMMITMENT FROM THE WHOLE TEAM. TO MAKE THIS A REALITY. I AM ALSO VERY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY STRIKE TEAM. AND THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE THUS FAR TO ENSURE WE ARE DELIVERING THE SERVICES. AND TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. THE DMV OF THE FUTURE IS AN ACHIEVABLE DESTINATION WE CAN GET THERE TOGETHER IN TIME. IN A MOVING TOWARDS THAT DESTINATION THE DMV IS VERY COMMITTED TO REDUCING WAIT TIMES FOR CUSTOMERS OFFERING MORE SELF SERVICE TRANSACTIONS. TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR FIELD OFFICE VISITS. I WISH TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY SINCE OCTOBER WHEN YOU LAST HAD A HEARING ON THE ISSUE. FOR NON APPOINTMENT CUSTOMER PLEASE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WAIT TIME HAS NOT EXCEEDED ONE HOUR. THE MONTHLY AVERAGE FOR APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES IS NOT EXCEEDED FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE PREVIOUS FOUR MONTHS. AND UPON INITIAL REVIEW FEBRUARY'S WAIT TIME DATA IS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM JANUARY. LAST AUGUST DMV SET A YEAR END GOAL OF REDUCING Q. WAIT TIMES TO AN AVERAGE OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES. FOR NON APPOINTMENT CUSTOMERS AND FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR CUSTOMERS WITH APPOINTMENTS. FOR PRE Q. WAIT TIMES THE GOAL FOR NON APPOINTMENT CUSTOMERS WAITING IS NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES AVERAGE. AND FOR APPOINTMENT CUSTOMERS TO WAIT NO MORE THAN THREE MINUTES AVERAGE. DMV HAS ACHIEVED THE OVERALL WEIGHT CALL TIMES FOR THE PAST FIVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS SINCE OCTOBER. AND ALTHOUGH WE'VE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IT DOES NOT MEAN OUR WORK IS DONE. DEAR WE WILL CONTINUE PROVIDING EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES. ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE A DMV FIELD OFFICES AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR ADDED CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE. OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL OFFICE. OUR SUCCESS REDUCING WAIT TIMES IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES THAT SOME SINCE SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH EMERGENCY APPOINTMENTS AND LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. TRIAGE IN CUSTOMERS WAITING TO IMPROVE AND EXPEDITE THE HANDLING OF TRANSACTIONS. USING SMART TABLETS TO CHECK CUSTOMERS INTO THE QUEUE FASTER AND TO ALSO ASSIST WITH ASSESSING ONLINE SERVICES OR TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. PROVIDING AN EXPEDITE LINE FOR EASIER TRANSACTIONS LIKE OBTAINING A DRIVING RECORD OR PICKING UP LICENSE PLATES OR DISABLE PLACARDS. PROVIDING TEXT MESSAGE NOTIFICATIONS TO CUSTOMERS SO THEY CAN HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO LEAVE THE DMV OFFICE. IN RETURN WHEN THEIR QUEUE NUMBERS ABOUT TO BE CALLED. IMPROVED INTEGRATION OF OUR DRIVERS LICENSE APPLICATION PROCESS. NOW REFER TO IT AS EASE SO CUSTOMERS SPEND LESS TIME IN A TECHNICIAN WINDOW. ADDITIONAL SERVICE HOURS WE ARE PART TIME IN SIXTEEN OFFICES AND SATURDAY SERVICES IN SIXTY TWO OFFICES FROM EIGHT AM TO FIVE PM. ENHANCING OFFICE PERFORMANCE INEFFICIENCIES IN SOME OFFICES FOR CUSTOMERS WAITING THROUGH PRE SCREENING THEIR DOCUMENTS. MONITORING FIELD OFFICE WAIT TIMES A REAL TIME THROUGH THE DMV COMMAND CENTER. AND OFFERING ONLINE SERVICES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE VISITING A FIELD OFFICE. THE DMV REMAINS COMMITTED TO REFINING EXISTING STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING NEW ONES TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO SUSTAIN IMPROVE THESE WAIT TIME LEVELS. AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED THE INPUT MADE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REAL ID ACT IS. A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE LONG WAITS AND WE DO ANTICIPATE. MORE CUSTOMERS ARRIVING AT OUR FIELD OFFICES AS WE APPROACH OCTOBER. ONE TWENTY TWENTY AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY EVERY CUSTOMER WANTING A FEDERALLY COMPLIANT LICENSE OR IDENTIFICATION CARD MUST VISIT A DMV FIELD OFFICE. WITH VALID PROOF OF IDENTITY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND RESIDENCY ALTERNATIVELY SOME CUSTER'S MAY CHOOSE TO USE A PASSPORT OR MILITARY ID FOR REAL ID PURPOSES. AND NOT REQUIRE A DMV ISSUED RELY TEAM. FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE'VE ISSUED A PROCESS WE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY ONE REAL ID'S. AND DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THROUGH FEBRUARY. DMV IS ISSUED A PARTIALLY TWO POINT THREE MILLION REAL ID'S AND AS OF FEBRUARY WE'VE ISSUE. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN FOR A TOTAL OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION REAL ID'S ISSUE TODAY. DMV IS WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON REVISING ARE FORECASTING. AND THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR HOPEFULLY IDENTIFY RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS TO ADDRESS THIS FORECAST. CUSTOMER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION IS A KEY COMPONENT TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS. THIS HELPS ENSURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS COME ALL THE DOCUMENTS NEEDED TO APPLY FOR A REAL ID. AS PART OF THAT EFFORT THE DMV IS ESTABLISHED A SPEAKERS BUREAU TO PROVIDE PRESENTATIONS FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THEIR CONSTITUENTS. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EVENTS YOU HOST FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT DMV IN OUR VARIOUS SERVICES INCLUDING REAL ID. FOR ALSO WHERE THAT MEMBERS OF ACTUALLY REACHED OUT pALREADY TO ARRANGE THESE -- EVENTS. IMPLEMENTING REAL ID CONTINUES TO POSE A CHALLENGE BUT TO BE VERY HONEST. DMV IS MORE PREPARED NOW TO RECEIVE CUSTOMERS THAT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. IN ORDER TO MEET REAL ID DEMANDS WE ARE ENSURING THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES AVAILABLE AND FIELD OFFICE IS OPEN TO SERVE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. OUR GOALS CONTINUE TO BE ENSURE THAT SERVICE WINDOWS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. TRIAGE CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE WE MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCIES AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE. MAINTAIN STRIKE TEAMS TO ADDRESS AREAS THAT NEED SPECIAL FOCS. MONITOR THE WAIT TIMES AT ALL FIELD OFFICES THROUGH OUR HEADQUARTERS COMMAND CENTER. EVALUATE EXPANSE ARSES THAT MAY BE POVIDED ONLINE. ASSESS THE NEED FOR OFFICE -- ADDED OFFICE HOURS REVIEW AND IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PERFORMANCE AUDIT. AND THE GOV OPS REINVENTION STRIKE TEAM TO USE TO RE DIRECT CUSTOMERS TO OTHERS SERVICE CHANNELS. A SECRETARY BATRA DISCUSSED IN HER OPENING REMARKS WE WANT TO EXPAND TRANSACTIONS THAT CUSTOMERS CAN COMPLETE.% WITHOUT VISITING FIELD OFFICES INCLUDING BY AUGUST. THIRTY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN ADDING THE D. ADDING TO THE DMV WEBSITE THE ABILITY FOR CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN A DUPLICATE REGISTRATION CARD OR DUPLICATE VEHICLE REGISTRATION STICKERS. AND BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN ADDING FOR NEW SERVICES TO SELF SERVICE TERMINALS. SO CUSTOMERS MAY RECEIVE A COPY OF A DRIVING RECORD OF VEHICLE RECORD. REPLACEMENT REGISTRATION AND REPLACEMENT VEHICLE REGISTRATION STICKER. DMV WILL CONTINUE WITH THE FRONT END APPLICATIONS SUSTAINABILITY PROJECT TO MODERNIZE ITS VEHICLE REGISTRATION CONTROL KASHER. BUSINESS APPLICATIONS IN ENSURE THE SYSTEM'S ARCHITECTURAL LINES WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND STATES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIC DIRECTION. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THESE GOALS WE ENSURE WE PROVIDE OUR EMPLOYEES THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS SO THEY CAN PROVIDE. SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE OFTEN UNDER VERY DEMANDING SITUATIONS SUCH AS WORKING SIX DAYS A WEEK AND SOME OF OUR OFFICES. LAST OCTOBER DMV SHARED WITH THIS COMMITTEE THEIR ABSENTEEISM RATE WAS CLOSE 230%. THAT NUMBER WAS ALARMINGLY HIGH WHICH THE COMMITTEE FOUND VERY CONCERNING AND I CAN KERN. HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THIS INFRMATION. AT THE TIME THE ABSENT HE IS A TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MULTIPLE FACTORS SUCH AS APPROVED TIME OFF. MATERNITY OR PATERNITY LEAVE CIVIC OR MILITARY DUTY AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF AN OFFICE ROSTER HAD TEN EMPLOYEES SCHEDULED TO WORK THAT DAY BUT ONLY EIGHT EMPLOYEES WERE PRESENT. THEN THE ABSENTEEISM RATE WAS THIS WAS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE ABSENCE WAS SCHEDULED OR UNSCHEDULED. BECAUSE OF THIS METHODOLOGY THE DEPARTMENT REPORTED A VERY HIGH ABSENTEES ARRAY AND WE WERE ASKED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN OUR EVALUATION OF OTHER ABSENTEEISM METHODOLOGIES WE DETERMINE AS MORE APPROPRIATE TO REDEFINE ABSENTEEISM WITH THE METRIC SIMILAR TO THAT USED BY THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL BUREAU OF LABOR STANDARDS. WHICH IS BASED ON ON SCHEDULED ABSENCES. TOWARDS THAT END THE DMV'S FIELD OPERATIONS DIVISION BEGAN GATHERING DATA UTILIZING THIS ABSENTEEISM METRIC. STARTING OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND OF SINCE THEN THE AVERAGE ABSENTEEISM RATE HAS BEEN SIX POINT 2%. IN COMPARISON 230%. THE SIX POINT 2% ABSENTEES ARRAY PROVIDES BOTH RELIEF AND REASSURANCE FOR DMV TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH THE ABSENT TO USE A RAKE CAN BE LOWERED. WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE HEALTHY. AND THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT IS PRODUCTIVE. TO HELP PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT FROM BOYS THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED CONVENE THE WELLNESS COMMITTEE. IDENTIFIED WELLNESS BOOSTERS AT EACH WORK LOCATION TO DEVELOP IN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS SERVING. D. REDISTRIBUTE THE ALL EMPLOYEE WELLNESS SERVING ON JANUARY THIRTIETH. TWENTY NINETEEN WITH FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES RESPONDING AS OF FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. THE DMV ANTICIPATES THE SURVEY RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT PARTICIPATE IN A HEALTH ENHANCEMENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION SURVEY WHICH DESIGNED TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CULTURE OF HEALTH AT THE WORK SITE. AND ASSIST IN DETERMINING CONDITIONS OF SUPPORT WELLNESS FOR IMPROVEMENT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT IS THE CURRENT EXTERNAL EVALUATIONS TAKING PLACE WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING ADDITIONAL INPUTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT IN THE STRIKE TEAMS RECOMMENDATIONS. THE DMV CAN IMPLEMENT TO HELP IMPROVE A MODERNIZE OUR ORGANIZATION. AND ENSURE WE ARE PROVIDING SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH REASONABLE WAIT TIMES. THE DEPARTMENT STILL HAS A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF IT. BUT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS AND ALL THE ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON. INCLUDING PROVIDING THE COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATED WORK PLAN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I WANT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS OUR EFFORTS AND WE ARE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- IN TERMS OF THE REAL STATUS OF THE OF THE REAL ID. I'M INTERESTED IN. LOOKING OUT HOW MANY ADDITIONAL REAL ID'S YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ISSUE AN IS THAT IS IT CLIMBING. ON A PER MONTHLY BASIS. AND HOW HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ACCOMMODATE -- WITH YOUR PLANNING THAT YOU HAVE. TO MEET THE DEADLINE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN IN MY SHORT TIME HERE A DMV IN THE DATA THAT I'VE LOOKED AT YES WE CAN SEE AN UP TECH AND I THINK -- ROBBIE CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THE PRIOR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE FORECASTING THAT WE'VE DONE. WELL I'M LOOKING AT LIKE OKAY GOT SOMEBODY DONE. AND THEN YOU HAVE -- HOW MANY MORE THAT ARE ON THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO? AND ARE YOU GONNA DO BETWEEN NOW AND THE DEADLINE HOW MANY ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE TO DO MORE. OF WORK PER MONTH. THEN YOU'RE DONE IN THE PAST. YEAH I WOULD ANTICIPATE BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AS MORE PEOPLE BECOME AWARE THAT THEY NEED TO REALIZE JEAN AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE DEADLINE. WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN PEOPLE COMING TO THE OFFICE -- IN SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS WERE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND FORECASTING THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FROM A RESOURCE STANDPOINT OR TO ADDRESS THAT INCREASE ARE YOU EXPECTING A SURGE RIGHT AT THE END LIKE. PROCRASTINATOR IS OR LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT EXPECT. THE EIGHTY MODERN FROM HEAVEN OR SOME KIND OF THING THAT CREATES -- AN EASIER PROCESS OR SOME KIND OF WAY OF GETTING AROUND THE REQUIREMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT. ALWAYS HAVE EXCUSES FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING TO WRITE THE END. ARE YOU EXPECTING -- A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT TO CORRER OR EXPECTED TO CALIFORNIA'S TO COME INTO THE OFFICE. ON A STEADY STREAM -- IN TERMS OF THE RELY DAY WHICH ONE ARE YOU EXPECTING. WELL I THINK IF WE LOOK AT THE TRENDS AND ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT THE DMV ACTUALLY HANDLES. WE ALWAYS HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN CLOSE TO THE VERY I THINK NEXUS OF THEIR DEADLINE -- WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NON APPOINTMENT ACTIVITY THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS -- THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE ARE PUTTING OUT WHAT I CALL FULL COURT EFFORT TO REALLY RAISE AWARENESS REMIND PEOPLE. OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR THEM TO HAVE IT IF THEY'RE GOING TO TRAVEL CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE A PASSPORT THEY CAN CERTAINLY TRAVEL WITH THEIR CURRENT DRIVER'S LICENSE AND A PASSPORT -- PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE THAT THAT'S NOT A WAY THAT THEY WANT TO TRAVEL AFTER THEY START DOING THAT SO WE ANTICIPATE. PEOPLE MAY CHANGE THEIR IDEA OF TRAVELING WITH BOTH DOCUMENTS TO YOUR POINT WE'RE TRYING TO ANTICIPATE WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW FROM A KIND OF A HUMAN TRENDING STANDPOINT WITH OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE HANDLE -- WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE THAT WILL PLAN AHEAD AND THEN-THERE WILL BE THOSE ARE PROBABLY PUSH IT TO THE VERY LAST MINUTE. AND ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE THAT I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SEARCHES I THINK CALLING CAN SPEAK TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN -- AS FAR AS SEASONAL SURGES WE KNOW THAT SUMMER MONTHS ACTUALLY BRING SURGES AND SO WE'RE ANTICIPATING A SUMMER SURGE OF PEOPLE COMING TO OUR OFFICES AND WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT BRINGING IN THE OUTSIDE RESOURCES ARE WORKING WITH OUR FELLOW DEPARTMENTS TO COME IN AND HELP WITH. HELP US IN THE SAME MANNER THEY HELPED US OVER THE SUMMER SOMEBODY -- PEOPLE PER MONTH HAVE YOU BEEN DOING IN TERMS OF WHAT'S YOUR AVERAGE PER MONTH TO TO HANDLE. TERMS OF YOU HAVE A REAL ID OR LIGHT. THAT'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND A MONTH THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND A MONTH. IF YOU KEPT OUT RATE HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE REGISTERED BY THE TIME THE DEADLINE. FOR A SUBSTANTIAL NOW WE DO ENVISION ALMOST LIKE WHAT'S THE NUMBER -- IF YOU IF YOU DID THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND A MONTH. LIKE FROM NOW TO THE DEADLINE HOW MONEY -- ROUGHLY FIVE MILLION A YEAR SO HOW WE ENVISION AS EARLY TO FROM THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WITH LIKE A HYBRID OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. IS WE THINK THAT THEY'LL BE A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE COMMON PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE BUT WE DO ENVISIONED A BE A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT COME IN AFTER THE DEADLINE ON THEIR NORMAL CYCLE. THAT DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A REAL ID AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME AND SO WHERE THEY WOULD BE -- BETWEEN NOW AND THE ADDED INTO THE REAL ID DEADLINE WOULD YOU EXPECT A MONTH AND IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORTH IT WAS ROUGHLY RIGHT AROUND FOURTEEN MILLION THAT WAS -- ANTICIPATED TO GO I'M PRIOR TO OCTOBER. TWENTY TWENTY HOW MANY A MONTH. WOULD YOU EXPECT -- HACER MANY TIMES AS I WANT YOU KNOW I'M HERE. CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE SO. I'M GIVING YOU A QUESTION ABOUT STE SIX TIMES NOW. HOW MANY MONTHS TO WOULD YOU EXPECT? I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX NINE THOUSAND MONTH OKAY ARE YOU -- YOU SO OU THINK THAT IF YOU HAD FIVE OR 600-060-01000 A MONTH. YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FINISH ALL THE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THE ONES BEFORE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SO IN A PROPOSAL I PROPOSALS ON THE ONE THAT WILL PUT IN FRONT OF THE THE LEGISLATURE AS IT RELATES TO HAS A MULTI YEAR SO GOES AFTER. THAT -- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY SAY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH A MALL BY OCTOBER THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS NOT A YEAR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THAT AS OF RIGHT NOW TO WHERE YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FINISH -- IT'S NORMALLY PROBABLY ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW TO GIVE ME A NUMBER YOU'RE ASKING YOUR QUESTION FOUR TO SIX MILLION PROBABLY ORDER SIX MILLION SO. SO HOT WHAT PERCENTAGES THAT OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REMAINING. MMHM SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CLOSE TO TWENTY SEVEN MILLION LICENSED DRIVERS YEAH. AND SO. I THINK THE LAST NUMBERS ON THROUGH ON HOW MANY YEARS SO. FOR FOR AND WE'VE DONE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS MILLION SO FAR -- WE ALSO KNOW OF THAT NUMBER -- THERE'S BEEN AN INDICATION ABOUT HOLD PASSPORTS. YEAH -- SO IF YOU BACK THAT NUMBER OUT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT MAYBE. IT AGAIN THE QUESTION IS IF YOUR PASSPORT HOLDER DO YOU STILL WANT TO DO A REAL IDE A LOT OF THIS IS SOMEWHAT SPECULATION OF GUESSING -- WE ANTICIPATE NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO COME AND GET A REAL ID THAT'S BEEN THE WHOLE FORECASTING BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO USE ALTERNATIVE. METHODS FOR TRAVEL -- SO I THINK LEAVE EVERYBODY WORE. NO IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT. OBSERVE THE FOUR TO SIX MILLION THAT WON'T ALBUM BY THE TIME. YOU -- IT THE DEADLINE RIGHT. SO YOU SENT. I'M IN THE OUT FISCAL YEARS CORRECT. SO SO YOU FINISH THE REST OF THEM. BY OCTOBER -- TWENTY TWENTY IDEALLY THAT WOULD BE THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SCORES OF THAT ERA. THE NUMBERS -- JUNE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. MINUS THREE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT'S TWENTY FOUR BILLION MINUS. SIX THE H. EIGHTEEN MILLION. I'M DOING MY REFER TO CARE. THERE IS THERE TO DO IT RIGHT WHEN I'M DOING IT RIGHT RIGHT. WELL I GOT I GOT A I'M JUST HOUSE NEWS CHRIS OR EIGHTEEN MILLION. SO HOW MANY MONTHS YOU HAVE LEFT. THROUGH OCTOBER ARE THROUGH THE END OF YOUR TO THE DEADLINE. HOW MUCH YOU HAVE LEFT NOW WELL. EIGHT EIGHTEEN MONTHS SIXTEEN NATO YOU'RE TALKING A MILLION A MONTH YOU HAVE TO DO RIGHT. IF YOU WANT TO FINISH A MALL IF YOU'RE INTO THE MALL. BY SUBTRACTED SIX OUT. SO EIGHTEEN YEAR MILLION A MONTH YOU SAY YOU'RE. ABLE TO DO FROM FIVE HONORED. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SO YOU STILL SHORT. FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND A MONTH. A THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET A SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO CLOSE THAT GAP THEM. THAT'S THE QUESTION RIGHT. TO AN ARITHMETIC HERE. ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO CLOSE THE GAP THIS IS THE QUESTION. WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES ARE LEADS TO THE NEXT FUNDING REQUEST AS YOU MAY BE AWARE IT'S ALWAYS A HOUSES FOR MORE MONEY OKAY. WHAT OTHER THINGS YOU'RE GONNA? YOURASSIST FOR MONEY GOOD WITH OTHER THINGS. I THINK YOU'RE GONNA DO ONLY ONE TYPE OF DEFICIENCIES YEAH I I'VE YEAH I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A NUMBER I I THINK SECRETARY BACHELOR ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THINGS I HAVE TO TAKE PLACE. ONE HOW DO WE MAKE THE REAL ID PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT -- HOW DO WE TAKE LESS TIME OFF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE TO PROCESS THE REAL ID WE'RE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVES TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW? I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY. INSURE THAT THE TRANSACTIONS GOING ON IN THE FIELD OFFICE ARE FOR WHEN A CALL COMPLICATED OR IN PERSON TRANSACTIONS. AND MOVE AS MANY SIMPLIFIED TRANS. EITHER A KIOSK ENVIRONMENT OR A MUCH IMPROVED WEBSITE ENVIRONMENT -- CITY YOUR POINT YOU KNOW I THINK. I DON'T KNOW IF CALLING YOU JUST MADE A ON TRANSACTIONS I'M I'M A GET CONFUSING Là. NUMBER. OKAY CAN YOU PREPARE FOR ME A ONE PIECE OF PAPER. THE ARITHMETIC ON HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO GET THIS. HOW MANY PEOPLE MONSTER TO PLAY DO WHAT YOUR PLAN IS SO I CAN JUST? WE CAN DO THAT. AND THEN WHAT YOUR PLAN TO YOU SAID DID YOU HAVE A PLAN NOW TO DO. FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND A MINDSET OF THE MAX YOU KNOW BUILDING UP FROM. RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A MONTH IN THE PAST SO YOU'RE BUILDING UP TO DO. FOUR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CORRECT. A MONTH SO YOU'RE GONNA DO MORE. BECAUSE OF ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS FOR MAKING BUT THEN YOU STILL HAVE A GAP TO CLOSE. WE ARE NOT. SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CLOSE THAT GAP IS. ONE TRYING TO GET OUT I MEAN I'M I'M I'M I'M. THIS IS KIND OF WHAT THE PUBLIC WANTS TO KNOW THEY WANT TO KNOW. LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE SO THE KIND OF LIKE LOOK AT IT. THIS IN THE WAY I AM THEY LOOK AT A KIND OF THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. ARE YOU GOING TO CLOSE THE GAP I MEAN WE WE APPRECIATE THE YOU KNOW THAT'S A STEADY IMPROVEMENT DENTURE [inaudible] MAKING [inaudible] BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE FACING IN TERMS OF THE REAL IDEA AND MAYBE SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS. HOW WE GONNA GET BEYOND THAT AND DO MORE? SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF REALLY DEAL DWELL ON IT THE REALITY SENSE THAT WE HAVE ON THIS OKAY SO.

WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE WOULD WE BE ABLE TO USE THE KIOSK FOR THE REALLY I WILL SAY I'LL GO ON THE RECORD SAYING YES THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE HAS TO BE IN PERSON PER TE FEDERAL LAW. OKAY MEMORY THINGS COULD BE DONE. SOME PLUMERI THINGS FOR THE REAR BEFORE YOU [inaudible] APPEAR PERSONALLY. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND WE DO HAVE ELECTRONIC DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATION AND THAT OUR CUSTOMERS CAN LOG ON FILL THAT OUT AHEAD OF TIME AND BRING THOSE ORIGINAL THOSE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS YOU KNOW THE OFFICE. READ ON TO PULL THAT DOWN IT JUST BE OUR TRANSACTION TIME. AND AND TO BE PREPARED AS WE SAID LOOK AT OUR INTERNET I KNOW THAT SECRETARY ABOUT HER AND AND A STRIKE TEAM ARE REALLY LOOKING AT HOW TO REINVENT NOT TO MAKE IT MORE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. THAN WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR INFORMATION I CAN FIND THAT RIGHT AWAY. OKAY I WOULD I WOULD OFFER TO IS WITH THE OROVILLE THAT SECRETARY BACHELOR SPOKE ABOUT ON THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS FOCUSED ON THE REAL ID PROCESS IN THE OFFICE AND AND THROUGH THAT ASSESSMENT WE ALSO HOPE TO IDENTIFY SOME OTHER INNOVATIONS THAT WE CAN INTRODUCE THE DMV OFFICE. TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. OKAY GIVEN THAT THE I WAS WONDERING HOW I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS BACK YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I THINK WAS DEALING WITH -- A BACKLOG OF LIKE PASSPORTS AND SOME ISSUES LIKE THAT HAVE WE LOOKED AT THE DMV MAYBE BRINGING -- ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FROM OTHER AGENCIES ARE HIRING A BUNCH OF FELLOWS TO ACTUALLY -- HELP WITH THE REAL LADY PROBLEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS GOING TO RAMP UP. AT THE CLOSER YOU GET TO THE DEADLINE I WOULD IMAGINE MORE PEOPLE OR THEN. HAVE MORE OF AN URGENCY TO GO GET THIS DONE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT TRAVEL. RIGHT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE USED YOU'LL NEED IT AT EVERY DOMESTIC AIRPORT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD BUT HAS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT THAT ARE WE WAITING FOR THE STRIKE TEAM TO LOOK AT THAT AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION OR OR SOMETHING TO HELP GET AT THIS. GROWING GAP THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS AT THE THE REAL ID. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION MEMBERS SALAS -- AND ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT HAVE ROBBIE SPEAK TO SOME OF THE STAFFING NUMBERS THEY'RE A PART OF OUR OWN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE ALSO HAVE REACHED OUT TO OUR FELLOW DEPARTMENTS -- THAT WAS PART OF THE COST WE PAID FOR FOR THE SUMMER SURGE -- COOLEY SOLOMON I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PREPARING FOR THE NEXT SUMMER'S SURGEON WORKING WITH OUR FELLOW DEPARTMENTS TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHERE THE DEMANDS ARE THERE. YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN WE HAVE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FIELD OFFICES WE HAVE UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- THOSE DEMANDS ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT IN EVERY FIELD OFFICE AND SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL AREAS THE DEMANDS WE CAN CERTAINLY HANDLE TYPICALLY WITH THE STAFF WE HAVE ON WHEN WE GET OUR MORE METROPOLITAN AREAS. WE OFTENTIMES SEE A HIGHER A NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND NEEDING ASSISTANCE SO IT'S ALSO PREPARING REGIONALLY AND BY OFFICE FOR THOSE DEMANDS WE ANTICIPATE COMING AND PROBABLY DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT AN INSOLENT CHIME IN REGARDS TO WHEN WE WERE DOING BEFORE THE FUNDING REQUEST FOR REAL. ID AND IT WAS ONLY FUNDED FOR TWO YEARS SO AS LAST FISCAL YEAR IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND ANOTHER FUNDING REQUEST IS GOING TO GO IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE. AS PART OF THE THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN IT WAS A PLACE HOLDER PROPOSAL AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PUT FORWARD A REQUEST THAT WOULD HAVE RESOURCES FOR THE REMAINING FISCAL YEARS. OKAY SO YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK AT IT GETTING SOME OF THE HEARING A RAMP UP. OR YOU CAN -- AT HAND IS THAT UNDER HE SAID WE'VE ALREADY FUNDED THAT FOR THESE LAST -- TWO FISCAL CYCLES. SO THEN GOING TO SENATOR BELL'S COMMENT SO COME MADE JUNE SHOULD WE EXPECT. THERE WILL BE ANOTHER BUDGET AUGMENTATION REQUESTS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER FUNDING REQUEST AS IT RELATES TO FOR THE REMAINING FISCAL YEARS. WE PUT A THOUSAND HOW MANY HOW% MANY IN THE LAST I RUN A THOUSAND ONE RIGHT NOW HOUSE AND WORKERS WE PROVED ALREADY. GOOD SUCH MORE. BASICALLY. BUT IT MARK OKAY AND THEN HAVE TWO OTHER QUESTIONS. TWO OTHER QUESTIONS -- BECAUSE YOU GUYS WERE GETTING READY FOR THIS AND OBVIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW ANECDOTALLY WE'LL HEAR ABOUT DMV AND SOME OF THE ISSUES BACK HOME. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A RED. I THINK I AM PROUD ABOUT -- LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE -- TO THAT ISSUE GET CORRECTED IS THAT COMPLETELY DONE WAS THE SOURCE IDENTIFIED IN OUR WE MOVING FORWARD IN CORRECTING THAT BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW IF WE CAN GET THAT RIGHT HOW READING AT THE REAL ID THING RIGHT. IF YOU COULD JUST COMMENT ON SOME OF THAT PLEASE THAT THAT MATTER HAS BEEN RESOLVED -- THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT WAS ACTUALLY DATING BACK TO SOME OF OUR OLD CODING INFORMATION THAT THE SECRETARY SPOKE ABOUT -- I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FOR THE DMV THAT DATES BACK TO PROBABLY THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES -- I DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ALWAYS FULLY KNOW ALL THE CODES AND SO ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED WAS A C THAT WAS EMBEDDED. IN OUR DRIVER'S LICENSE RENEWAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND SO THAT TRIGGERED -- SOME ISSUES FOR US FROM A PROCESSING STANDPOINT WE'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT AFTER WE DID SOME RECALLS ANALYSIS. WE'VE ACTUALLY FIX THAT ISSUE AND WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY FOLKS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY IT AND AS OF LAST WEEK WE ACTUALLY HAD RESOLVED ALL OF THOSE DRIVERS LICENSE ISSUES AND HAVE MAILED OFF FOLKS ON DRIVER'S LICENSE -- I THINK YOU KNOW AS FAR AS YOUR CONCERNED DOES THIS HAPPEN AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE'RE STRIVING TO DO IS RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE TESTING WHEN WE MAKE CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CATCHING. SOME OF THE CODING ISSUES THAT -- FRANKLY STAFF WHO WERE OF ALL THE CODING HAVE RETIRED OR NOT PART OF THE STAFF ANYMORE -- AND DO WE HAVE THROUGH THE TEN CHOOSE AS THAT. BUT THAT'S REALLY PART O THE OVERALL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERTAKE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL RELYING ON KOBOL CODES IN THE SUMMER CODES IT'S A VERY OLD AND DATED SYSTEM. AND WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT TRANSFORMING THE DMV SYSTEM SO IT CAN BE MORE AGILE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE DMV. I WAS THE ENVY MOVING TO THE WHOLE FIRST CAL. OUR SYSTEM AS WELL OR NO. WHERE ARE WE ON THE SCHEDULE FOR THE NETWORK WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE DEFERRED DEPARTMENT FROM THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE? FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE MOVING TOWARDS. WE HAVE AN ORACLE ADMINISTRATIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM SOME WORMS CAL STARS OR THEIR CUSTOMERS OKAY BUT I JUST THE ONE MORE QUESTION ON A DIFFERENT ASPECT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP YOUR TESTIMONY THE THE WELLNESS PROGRAM AD THE EMPLOYEES OF TURN UNDERSTAND. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CULTURE DMV. YOU KNOW OUR WE HAVE A HUGE WORKLOAD BEFORE US WE SEE THAT COMING THERE'S BEEN ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ALONG THE WAY WE HAVE A STRIKE TEAM NOW -- YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE SAY WE GRANTED ADDITIONAL JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE WE GRANT AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION IN THE BUDGET BUT YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE. WANTING TO DO THIS AND TACKLE THIS OR IS THERE A SENSE OF FEELING OVERWORKED AND IT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER BARRIER FOR US GETTING ALL THIS WERE COMPLETED. A TREMENDOUS AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CULTURE DMV IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT OFFICES AND AND THE TASK AHEAD OF US. SO I CAN ONLY COMMENT ON MY OBSERVATIONS THE LAST SIX WEEKS BUT WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU IS MY IMPRESSION OF THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION THE DMV EMPLOYEES IT'S IT REALLY IS AMAZING AND IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE EVEN UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND SOMETIMES VERY CRITICAL. REVIEWS OF THE DMV THESE FOLKS COME TO WORK EVERY DAY REALLY FOCUSED ON THE PURPOSE OF THEIR JOB AND WANTING TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE VERY BEST LEVELS THAT THEY CAN. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO GIVEN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND THE TOOLS SO THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THAT JOB BECAUSE THEIR HEART IS THERE. IT'S GIVING THEM I THINK THE SKILLS AND THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER ON THAT MISSION. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO COME -- AND REALLY CELEBRATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT ALSO REALLY MAKE SURE WE'RE WORKING TO IMPROVE HOW WE SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND AS I SAID EARLIER IT'S REALLY ABOUT BUILDING THAT FUTURE DMV THAT BETTER SERVES OUR CHILDREN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. BUT I WANTED THE DMV STAFF TO GET EXCITED ABOUT THAT FUTURE VISION AND LAYING THAT OUT IS REALLY CREATED KIND OF A RALLY CRY TO SAY HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN HOW CAN WE BE PART OF A AND IF I CAN ADD TO THAT. IS WHILE. TALKING TRACK FIELD OFFICE STAFF DAILY TO SEE THEIR ENTHUSIASM IN THE SUMMERTIME IS THAT A TOUGH TIME FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. HE GREW THROUGH THAT AND THEY HAVE A DEDICATED HEART AND SOUL TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T LIKE LONG WAIT LINES JUST AS MUCH AS OUR CUSTOMERS DON'T LIKE IT FROM A FROM A STANCE WHEN THEY'RE SEEING THAT. SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO REALLY AND SO PART OF THE CHANGE AND PART OF THE PROCESS AND THEY WELCOME THE SUPPORT. OF OUR NEW AND AT G. DIRECTOR AS WELL AS THE STRAIGHT TEAM AND THE PUBLIC AS WELL. AND AND THEY'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CHALLENGE AND I'M EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE EFFORTS THAT THEY PUT FORTH THUS FAR. AND I'M IS ENGAGING THEM AND WE'RE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THEM AND COMMUNICATE [inaudible] GALGIANI -- I JUST WANTED TO CALL SOMETHING TO YOUR ATTENTION AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ATTENTION ALSO WE'RE GETTING CALLS IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE THAT -- FOR MEMBERS OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE WHEN THEY GO TO GET REAL ID. AND THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE MOST TIMES WILL INCLUDE THEIR LAST NAME IS THEIR MOTHER'S LAST NAME AND THEN THE FATHER'S LAST NAME. AND THEN WHEN THEY PROVIDE OTHER DOCUMENTATION IT'S NOT MATCHING AND A SOME WONDERING IF IF YOU RECALL EXPERIENCING THAT AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO DO. TOO HELP THAT PROCESS ALONG. I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT DIRECTLY OR HEARD OF THAT DIRECTLY FROM OUR STAFF I CAN CHALLENGE -- DEFINITELY I THINK WHAT WE CAN DO IS GO BACK AND AND TOUCHES FOR OUR STAFF AND FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE THAT BETTER -- WHETHER IT'S ON THE INTERNET WORKING WITH OUR STAFF. I'M HAPPY TO TO SPEAK WITH YOU OR YOUR STAFF AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IT'S A COMMON THING THAT HAPPENS YES. OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS ORDER QUESTIONS. WE SHOULD DO. BEEN HERE WILL HAVE THE NEXT TO LAST. ANALYSTS TO COME FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT. I NEEDED A NEW LEE IS THE PRINCIPAL FISCAL POLICY ANALYST. FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SHE IS GOING TO PRESENT THE REPORT TO US SO WELCOME. THE NEED A AND YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THAT AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US ON THE SERGEANTS ARE CURRENTLY PASSING OUT A HANDOUT THAT WILL BE USING -- TO GUIDE OUR COMMENTS TODAY WILL REALLY BE FOCUSING ON KIND OF WHERE WE ARE NOW AND ISSUES ON THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD -- WE'RE GONNA -- ON CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE ALL GET OVER THAT BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD OF IT AT LENGTH IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS. YES. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE'RE GOING TO SKIP OVER THIS PAGE THIS GENERALLY PROVIDES. INFORMATION ON REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION AND THE IMPACT ON DMV OPERATIONS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED SO FAR AND I THINK THIS THIS PAGE I'LL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPTH ON AND SO -- GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE WORKLOAD THE STATE DID PROVIDE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR TWO YEARS AND SPECIFICALLY IT WAS TWENTY THREE MILLION FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN POSITIONS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FORTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION TO SUPPORT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POSITIONS. IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON TOP OF THAT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET INCLUDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT PROVIDED DMV NO SOONER THAN THIRTY DAYS NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND THE TWO REQUESTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED -- UNDER THAT AUTHORITY ONE HAS BEEN APPROVED AND ONE IS STILL PENDING. THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED WITH THE SUBMITTED AND APPROVED IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS FOR SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POSITIONS SO IN TOTAL THAT BRINGS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALLOCATION TO DMB TO SIXTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION TO SUPPORT SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY POSITIONS. THE SECOND AMOUNT WHICH IS PENDING -- WAS SUBMITTED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IN THAT REQUEST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INDICATES THAT IT INTENDS TO PROVIDE DMV WITH AN ADDITIONAL FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. NO SOONER THAN APRIL THIRTIETH. EIGHTEEN AND THE DMV INDICATED THAT THIS FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POSITIONS AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED TO DATE TO BRING THE WAIT TIMES DOWN. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. WHEN WAS THAT SUBMITTED? THE THE FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION WAS SUBMITTED IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO IT'S STILL OUTSTANDING NOW [inaudible] GOOD. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT THIS PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE VARIOUS -- COMPONENTS RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET THAT IMPACTS THE DMV. SO THE FIRST AS THE DEPARTMENT REFERENCED THERE IS A PLACE HOLDER BUDGET REQUEST FOR SIXTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO SUPPORT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS WHICH IS THE AMOUNT THAT WE'VE PROVIDED SO FAR. IN THE CURRENT YEAR. HOWEVER THEY'VE CLEARLY INDICATED THAT THIS REQUEST WILL BE UPDATED AS DMV'S OPERATIONS AND PROCESSES ARE EVALUATED. AND THERE THEY ARE LOOKING TO HAVE TWO EVALUATIONS INFORM THAT ONE IS THE DMB REINFECTION STRIKING WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT THE FIRST PANEL. BUT THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE PERFORMANCE AUDIT THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES OFFICE OF AUDITS AND EVALUATION. AND THAT WAS STARTED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND IT'S EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF MARCH. THE FINAL -- THING THAT WE WOULD BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTUALLY INCLUDES A NEW PROPOSAL FOR A NEW OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION WHICH WOULD BE HOUSED WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. AND THIS OFFICE IS REALLY TASKED WITH -- REQUIREMENTS FOR A DIP AS FOR DEPARTMENTS TO REASSESS THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL TO LOOK AT RE ENGINEERING CUSTOMER SERVICE DELIVERY AND ALSO TO LEVERAGE -- KIND OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THAT'S AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE CONSIDERING AS PART OF ITS BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. AND THEY DID INDICATE THE DMB WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE IF IT WAS APPROVED. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT -- IN EVALUATING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS WE DID IDENTIFIES THREE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. AND SO THE FIRST IS THAT A NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MAY BE FLAGGED IN THESE HAVE VALUATIONS COULD GENERATE LONG TERM SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THE STATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT DMV OPERATES MORE EFFICIENTLY OR IMPROVES ITS CUSTOMER SERVICES HOWEVER SOME OF THESE CHANGES MAY TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND TIME TO ACTUALLY REALIZE ALL OF THE BENEFIT. AS THE LEGISLATURE MAY REALLY WANT TO CONSIDER FOCUSING ON CHANGES THAT CAN GENERATE MORE IMMEDIATE IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE COMING IN. WHICH WILL LIKELY MEAN THAT DMV'S WORK A LEVELS ARE AT LEAST SIMILAR IF NOT HIGHER AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER THEIR HEART. YES FOR MONTHS PLEASE I WAS TRYING TO GET THAT NUMBER. LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE HIGHER. YES AND SO AN EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD GIVE HERE IS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL OR IMPROVED OUTREACH EFFORTS COULD REALLY IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE FIELD OFFICES WITH ALL OF THEIR PAPERWORK. COMPLETED ALL NECESSARY PAPERWORK COMING IN WITH THEM AND I WOULD REALLY REDUCE THE OVERALL TRANSACTION TIME PER INDIVIDUAL. THE SECOND ISSUE OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER IS REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE DMV REINVENTION STRIKE TEAM TO REPORT IN THE SPRING AT HEARINGS. ON ALL OF THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND CHANGES THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED STATE AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE AND EXAMINE ALL OF THEM NOT JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUSION IN. THE UPDATED BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER WHICH OF THESE -- OR OTHERS IT WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVING THE PENDING INSOLVENCY OF THE MOTOR EHICLE COUNT WHICH SUPPORTS BOTH DMV AS WELL AS A CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. AND FINALLY REGARDLESS OF HOWEVER MUCH MONEY IS PROVIDED -- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IT'S INTERESTED IN AND SO FOR EXAMPLE. I AM I REFERENCE THE PENDING. FORTY REQUEST THAT'S OUTSTANDING WHEN THAT REQUEST CAME IN IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DMV INDICATED THAT A PORTION OF THE FUNDING THAT THEY WERE REQUESTING HAD ALREADY BEEN SPENT. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO ACTUALLY SEEK SPENDING OR INCREASING COSTS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN DETERMINE THE REASONS FOR THOSE COSTS INCREASE AND AND WHAT ACTIONS IF ANY. THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO TAKE MOVING FORWARD. AND SO WITHOUT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WHAT WOULD BE THE NORMAL PROCESS FOR THEM TO REQUEST A BUDGET [inaudible] OF ADDITION. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THEY START SPEND THE MONEY AND THEN THEY COME IN AFTERWARDS AND ASKED FOR IT. OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NORMAL PROCEDURE. SO THERE ARE -- SIDE THERE'S LANGUAGE IN TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE BUDGET BILL WHICH WE CALL -- CONTROL SECTIONS AND SO THERE'S A SECTION LETTER PROCESS. FOR WHICH REQUESTS CAN BE SUBMITTED USUALLY -- DEPARTMENTS MAY SAY THERE'S AN UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES ETCETERA -- THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO BUILD IN LANGUAGE AS PART OF THE BUDGET AND SO THE TO REQUEST THAT I TALKED ABOUT ARE ACTUALLY PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WAS BUILT IN AS PART OF DMV'S BUDGETARY ALLOCATION THE FOR THE RULES THIS TIME OR WAS IT -- GRAY LINE. WAS THE RULES FAULT. BUDGET RULES. SO I'VE THAT SO IN TERMS OF THE FIRST ONE THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION THAT -- ONE KIND OF WENT THROUGH THE ROUTINE PROCESS AND IT WAS APPROVED THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS -- THAT WERE RAISED TO JUST IN TERMS OF JUST FORWARD WHAT ACTIONS WERE BEING TAKEN -- OVERSIGHT ABOUT WAIT TIMES EXCITE OR A ON THE SECOND ONE IT'S A IT'S A MUCH LARGER REQUEST IT'S FORTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- I THINK THAT THERE'S LESS CONCERNED ABOUT PROCESS -- IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED I THINK THERE IS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN AS WE INDICATED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK MOVING FORWARD. ABOUT WHAT STAGE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE DEPARTMENT THOSE WHO COME FORWARD OR RELIEVE THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WHEN THEY SUBMITTED THE REQUEST THAT WAS THE ONE WHERE A PORTION OF IT THEY HAD ALREADY SPENT THE DOLLARS TO SO. I WOULD SAY APPROXIMATELY HALF OF IT HAD BEEN SPENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS SPENT ABOUT TWENTY MILLION A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT YEAH. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. I IT IS GAS SO THAT THE DATE IS APRIL THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN WHICH ACTION WE NEED TO BE TAKEN AS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANOTHER ONE ANTICIPATED IN THIS FISCAL YEAR. THAT IS A QUESTION THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENTS THEY CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION. YEAH BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THEIR INTENTION IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY PLAN ON SUBMITTING WHILE WORKING WITH THE PART IN A FINANCED OR TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS. YOU KNOW EVERY THREE MONTHS ASKING FOR MONEY THING THAT'S GOING ON HERE SO SO. AND HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY. AND THEN WHAT IS THE OVER YOU KNOW LIKE OVERALL BUDGET REQUEST I THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A CLEARER PICTURE ON THE SUBJECT. ABOUT WHAT THE MONEY SITUATION AS WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS IT'S PRETTY. CLEAR FOR US -- WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST TO KNOW IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY. YES I AM AS PART OF OUR BUDGET WORKLOAD APRIL AND MAY WHICH WHICH YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH. WE WILL EVALUATE THE UPDATED PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IS CLEARLY INDICATED THERE'S AN UPDATED PROPOSAL COMING. AND SO WE WOULD EVALUATE THAT ALONG WITH WHAT CHANGES -- THE DEPARTMENT OR THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IN MIND THAT A COMPANIES THAT REQUEST YOU THINK THAT THE THAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF DONE SO FAR. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE REAL ID APPLICATIONS. ARE BY THE DEADLINE. IN THE UPDATED REQUESTS TO WE WOULD LOOK AT THEIR FORECASTING METHODOLOGY I THINK FROM THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN REVISITING THAT -- AND SO WE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THEM AND SO AT THAT POINT WE WOULD BE. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER ADVISE YOU. IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES IWOULD READ THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING -- IS THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE -- SUCH A LARGE GAP. THAT IT MAY BE A VERY COSTLY REQUEST. AND I THINK HAVING A SURPRISE LAKE -- TWO WEEKS BEFORE I APPROVAL OF A HUNDRED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WOULD NOT BE A VERY NICE THING TO DO THAT THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE. OF WHAT THE REQUEST MIGHT BE -- I TRIED TO GET THE INFORMATION -- WILL TRY TO GET IT MORE BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR OPINION AS WHAT SCOPE AND MAGNITUDE YOU THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THERE'S REALLY TWO LEVERS THAT YOU POLL -- THERE IS THE THE THE SALARY AND EMPLOYEES IN TERMS OF HERE'S THE WORKLOAD WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ELSE THIS IS WHERE WE'RE OPERATING -- HERE'S A LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED -- I THINK FROM THE DISCUSSION TODAY THERE'S CLEAR RECOGNITION THAT THE SECOND LEVER WHICH NEEDS TO BE CHANGED WHICH IS THIS ISSUE OF EFFICIENCY IS AN OPERATIONAL CHANGES. AND THAT WILL LIKELY NEED ON THAT OTHER SIDE IN TERMS OF EMPLOYEES AND STAFF I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE IN PROGRESS WE'VE HEARD OF THINGS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL -- BUT REALLY THAT KIND OF LEADS TO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE POTENTIALLY CONSIDER WHICH IS. WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE CHANGES WHAT CHANGES -- HOW WILL HAVE KIND OF IMMEDIATE IMPACT BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THIS LOOMING DEADLINE OF OCTOBER? TWENTY TWENTY AND WHAT WERE YOU KNOW IN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT THE EXACTION NUMBERS WE DO KNOW THAT GIVEN TO DATE. WHETHER IT'S TWO POINT FIVE OR THREE MILLION INDIVIDUALS WHO COME FORWARD YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE A NUMBER. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL COME FORTH BEYOND YOU JUST THE NORMAL CYCLE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DOING RENEWALS THE REASON I'M ASKING THESE QUESTIONS IS YOU. I THINK WHICH IS FOCUS ON THE MEDIA TRY. TO DEAL WITH -- WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOING TO BE A STEADY. NUMBER OR SOMETHING IS GONNA SEARCH AT THE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE PROBABILITY THAT WILL. BE HAPPENING. UP TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE GONNA. WANT TO HAVE THE REAL ID'S. BUT THEN FIND THAT -- THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET AT THE END BECAUSE OF A JUST -- BREAK DOWN BECAUSE OF THE HUGE SURGE THAT TAKES PLACE. THAT'S BY. pTHINK THAT -- WE WANT. TO TRY THE PLAN -- APPROPRIATELY AND DO WITH THAT -- BY BOTH MONEY SOLUTION WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EFFICIENCY SOLUTION. FOR THAT AND OF I THINK. WE NEED YOUR HELP IN IDENTIFYING THE THE SOLUTIONS -- TO BE TARGETED. THE COULD SAVE US THE MOST MONEY AND TIME FOR THE PROCESSING AND SO FORTH. I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT -- BUT ALSO ON A LONG TERM BASIS SO. YOU HAVE REACHED LEAST A REPORT OR OR ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND CORRECT. CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA A REPORT JUST A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT THE REPORT SAID. SHORT OF MORE OF A MEDIUM TERM. SURE -- SO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. RECEIVES A VARIETY OF FEES INCLUDING -- SOME OF THE FEES THAT ARE CHARGED BY DMV SO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEE -- YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE WE ACCEPT OUR A AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN OPERATIONAL SHORTFALLS IN RECENT YEARS AND KIND OF LOOKING TOWARDS THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- IT'S PROJECTED TO BECOME POTENTIAL SO -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDED A FEW ACTIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THAT INSOLVENCY PROFOUNDLY RELATED -- TO DELAYING FOR EXAMPLE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS ETCETERA. INS AND IN OUR REPORT WE DID PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FOR THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT INSOLVENCY. ANSWER SOME OF THOSE THINGS INCLUDE -- THERE'S CURRENTLY AT A LOAN THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED RELATED TO A SUPPLEMENTAL PETE. IT'S NOT REALLY LAUNCH -- IT'S IT'S A PAYMENT SCHEDULE REPAYMENT SCHEDULE RELATED TO A SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT PLAN THAT WAS MADE AND IT'S THE REPAYMENT HAS TO COME FROM THE VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS AND S ONE SOLUTION IS TO KIND OF DELAY OR CHANGE. ON THAT SCHEDULE FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT. THE OTHER ONE IS TO POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE THIS GENERAL FUND TRANSFER THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING MADE FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT INTEREST ENDING THAT TRANSFER. ANOTHER ONE IS A TRANSFER FUNDS. IT'S A TRANSFER FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO THE GENERAL FUND ONE WAS. WITH THE USE OF FOR WELL WHEN IT'S THAT THEY GIVE A PURPOSE SERVICES GENERALLY JUST DONE IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE GENERAL FUND. FOR LEGISLATIVE PURPOSES OKAY MY COLLEAGUE. THE QUESTION I HAVE IS LIKE WAS THERE. SOMEBODY SOMEBODY CAME UP AND SAID WHAT WE WANT TO TRANSFER -- THIS MONEY AND THEN SOMEBODY ASKED THE QUESTION WHY OKAY LOW THAT'S THE IN. QUESTION I WOULD HAVE WELL WHY WAS IT TRANSFER. THERE WAS A REASON. OKAY WE GOT ANOTHER HEALTHCARE ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM THE LA OKAY HE STARTED BEGINNING IN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN AND IT REALLY WAS SORT OF A ONE TIME THE FIRST YEAR. BECAUSE THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION AT THE TIME IN THESE ARE. REVENUES THAT ARE RESTRICTED BY THE CONSTITUTION UNLIKE THE REGISTRATION FEES TWITTER FOR WHEN YOU'RE THERE WITH A DIFFERENT ANOTHER ONE TIME BASIS BUT IDEA WAS IT WAS POSSIBLY TEMPORARY. BUT AFTER A WHILE WE JUST THAT ARE DOING ON ONGOING BY BUDGET AXES TO DO THIS FOR YOU HOW THE FUNDS REMAIN IN THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. THAT WITHOUT HELP THE SOLVENCY ISSUE. IT WILL COMPLETELY SOBER BUT IT WILL HELP. OKAY SO SO IF THERE'S A FURTHER BUDGET REQUEST OTHER THAN THIS. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE COMING THIS FISCAL YEAR MAYBE AND THEN -- THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. WITH THOSE -- WITH THAT COME OUT OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE FINER HOW WOULD THAT WITH THOSE -- REQUEST BEFORE CORRECT -- LIKE -- MISLI MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES HAVE A PLACE HOLDER FOR THE WRITING WAIT TIMES THE EXTENT ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT LEVEL. THAT WILL COME FROM IN VA. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SECRETARY ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS HAVING MORE KIOSK HAVING MORE STAFF THAT'S ALL GOING TO COME FROM BECAUSE OF THE MV UNLESS YOU FIND SOME OF THE FUND SOURCE? I WOULD ALSO NOT EVEN THE IDEA OF USING CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS CURRENTLY WHEN WE DO WHEN -- PORT CERVICAL ONLINE WITH A CREDIT CARD AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT PRACTICE AND ALLOW CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AND FILLED OFFICE. IN THE STATE PICKED UP THE TRANSACTION BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER HIT TO THEM VIA TO THE EXTENT IT'S PAID FOR FROM THE MPA. JUST JUST -- MY FILL ALL PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH OF FOCUSING THE DMV ON CORE SERVICES ONLY. AND GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE STUFF LIKE I SAID THE PENAL CODE IN MAYBE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING SOME OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT THE DMV DOES. FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICE SOMEBODY SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS BUT WE HEARD THAT TODAY -- THE QUESTION WOULD BE CAN YOU. IN YOUR ANALYSIS BEFORE WEEKS RECEIVE THESE REQUESTS FOR BUDGET -- GIVE US A PROJECTION OF HOW THEY'RE GOING. TO MEET THE DEADLINE FOR THE REAL ID AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND AFTER THAT. IS THERE ARE GOING TO BE. MORE THE THE THE THE THEY IMPLY THAT THERE WILL BE SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL APPLY FOR THIS MONEY AFTER. THE DEADLINE FOR THE DMV IS THAT MEAN THAT THEY'RE GOING. TO CONTINUE TO DRAW DOWN THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND FOR THE REAL LIKE THE COST -- SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I WANT A NEED SOME. CLARIFICATION ON IN TERMS OF THIS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTS ITS UPDATED PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES? WE WILL KIND OF EVALUATE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS SO AS YOU'RE SAYING THE ESTIMATES QUESTIONS FOR THE YES SO THE ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBERS THAT ARE COMING IN EXETER AT AN AS PART OF THAT -- AND AS WELL AS ANY OTHER SPRING BUDGET REQUEST THAT MAY COME FORWARD -- WE WOULD KIND OF SEE WHAT THAT IMPACT WAS ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT LOOK AT THAT FINE CONDITION AND SO WE WOULD EVALUATE FOLLOW. YOU VALUE WITH THE ANY. OF THE POTENTIAL FISH THAT'S YEAH AND AND THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND MONEY OF THAT THAT THAT'S AND THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO BALANCE THE FOR WE'RE GOING AND DEFAULT ON THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND WE HAVE TO KIND OF WE'RE YOU KNOW SAVE SOME MONEY SOMEWHERE. SO EVENTULLY FOR THOSE THAT THINGS WILL LOOK AT ALSO THING FROM THE LECTURES OVERSIGHT WHEN THEY MINISTRY SINCE COME FOR WITH ANY EFFICIENCIES WHETHER IT'S ENCOURAGING MORE PREFERRED ONLINE. I SHOULD ASK THEM HOW IS THAT GOING TO HOUSE A SECOND SAVE MONEY WITHOUT HAVING SOME TO GO IN THE FIELD OFFICE PART OF THEIR TRANSACTION IS GOING TO BE LESS WORK LOW SO WHAT IS THAT FREE UP. CAN ONLY DO ONE LOOK AT THE COST OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT ALSO WHAT ARE THE SAVINGS THEY EXPECT TO GENERATE THAT COULD BE. REDIRECTED TO OTHER THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE TO REGISTER CARVE A YEAR THAT'S ANOTHER ONE I MEAN THE THE OTHER OTHER IDEAS FOR THE WE SHOULD HAVE LIKE -- AN EVALUATION OF ALL THOSE IDEAS -- AND IF WE PUSH THOSE EFFICIENCY IDEAS OFTEN. I THINK IT IT CREATES A PROBABILITY THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SURGE THAT WILL ALL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH. THAT'S THAT'S MY OPINION. I THINK WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT NOW. COME UP WITH EFFICIENCIES NOW DOT WAIT GET IT GOING. IT'S OF THESE IDEAS MOVING ALONG I HOPE THE STRIKE FORCE -- IS ABLE. TO A TAKE THE SENSE OF URGENCY. FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE FUND'S SOLVENCY AND THE MEETING THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE -- CALIFORNIANS HAVE ALL THEIR REAL ID -- DONE BY THE DEADLINE.
