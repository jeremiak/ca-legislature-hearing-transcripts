LEYVA MCGUIRE [inaudible] MONNING [inaudible] HERE. MORE LUCK. MORRELL [inaudible] CAN [inaudible] ROTH [inaudible] SKINNER. STERN STONE. NUMBER. WHY KASKI? THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM --GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES MISTER THIS ONE IS ON THIS LIST ONE OFTENI FIT IT PERFECTLY BEFORE I GAVEL DOWN. THE PRESSURE OF YOU ALL BEING HERE WATCHING ME. AND BEING ON CAMERA MAKES ME SCREW IT UP MR THIS ONE OFF AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TWO TRAILER BILLS. AB ONE HUNDRED SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND AB ONE ALL -- THREE WHICH IS OUR HEALTH. TRAILER BILL NUMBER. TWO THESE BILLS ALONG WITH FIVE OTHER BILLS THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER HE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO TAKE UP ON THE FLOOR THIS AFTERNOON. I WOULD NOTE THAT AB ONE OH ONE THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TRAILER BILL -- WE WILL NOT BE HEARING TODAY AND MAY BE BACK IN COMMITTEE LATER THIS WEEK FOR DISCUSSION. MISTER VICE CHAIR IN THE COMMENTS FOR ME BEFORE WE GET STARTED OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL HERE AB ONE HUNDRED FINANCE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO THE FIRST BILL BEFORE YOU AB -- ONE HUNDRED ESTABLISHES THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS GRATEFUL FOR MANY THE LEGISLATORS HERE FURTHER WE SHIP I SEE SENATOR MINING HERE. ON THE COMMITTEE SO THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE SEVEN FOUR DOUBLE DRINKING WATER FIND -- UNDER THE PROGRAM ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT THAT WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATUREAND COMMITTEE STAFF -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR THERE WOULD BE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AS WELL AS THIRTY NINE DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE THREE YEARS AFTER THAT THERE WOULD BE A 5% CONTINUES APPROPRIATION FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. UP TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IN THE YEARS AFTER THAT BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY THERE WOULD BE A HUNDRED THIRTY NINE DOLLARS DEVOTED TO THE PROGRAM AND ITS TOP WEREN'T COMPLETELY FILLED BY THE 5% CONTINUES APPROPRIATION. THERE WOULD BE ATTACK FELL FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO REACH THAT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE DOLLARS LEVEL. I'M AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THERE ABOUT ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER SO THE WAY THIS TRAILER BILL STRUCTURED IS TO MEET THAT GOAL -- PROVIDING WATER TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED THAT'S TRUE THE CONSOLIDATION -- WATER SOURCES IT'S THREE EXTENSION OF THOSE WHAT CLEAN WATER SOURCES -- THROUGH A SET AT SUPPORT FOR OPERATION AND WITH A REAL FOCUSED ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE COMMITTEES WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE WATER GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES -- SPECIFIC -- REPORTING LANGUAGE FROM THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE FUND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND SO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO NOT ONLY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER THAT PLAN. REPORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW THEY'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER AND WHAT METRICS THAT WE'RE MEETING A YEAR TO YEAR. AND SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN PROVISIONS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS. SEVEN TO NIELSEN. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE NO THEN TAX INCREASES IT AT ALL IN HERE'S STRICTLY GENERAL FUND AND GREENHOUSE GAS CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THIS IS A MAJORITY VOTE BILL. SEVEN TO WORK OWSKI ON THE UNIVERSE -- ON PAGE. THIRTEEN OF THE BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMALL. OUR STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS OUR SYSTEM SAID HAVE UP TO FOURTEEN HOOKUPS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OF THE MILLION PEOPLE THAT YOU REFERENCE ABOUT HALF OF THEM. MEET THAT JURISDICTION AND THE OTHER HALF ARE OUTSIDE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES. CONTROL BOARD IS THAT CORRECT. A THIRD I GOT THE PART OF FINANCE SO I'M NOT SURE THE PACIFIC BREAK OUT BETWEEN THE SMALLS AND THE LARGER COMMUTERS AND WE COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE THAT -- INFORMATION AFTERWARDS. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THESE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IF THE STATE. MORTARBOARD DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OF WITH. PEOPLE'S WELLS FOR PEOPLE THAT-HAVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE LESS THAN FOURTEEN HOOK UPS. WE'RE STILL POINT TO PROVIDE THOSE PEOPLE WITH ASSISTANCE. EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THEM. BASED ON THE LAW THE NEW LANGUAGE I JUST SAW. YES SO -- THIS LANGUAGE DOES PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE WATER BOARD TO HAPPEN TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS INTO THE VENTURE COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY WHICH IS WHERE -- SOME OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE LIES -- THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT REGULATORY POWER OVER THEM A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES DO SUFFER FROM NOT HAVING -- SAFE DRINKING WATER SO THIS FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOWABLE YOU SOURCE OF SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES. SEC THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD HAS HAD TROUBLES GETTING. SMALL SYSTEMS WITH FOURTEEN OR MORE TO DO PROPER OPERATIONS TO DO PROPER INVESTMENT TO DO THE PROPER CONSOLIDATION WHEN WE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THEM BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY WE GAVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AUTHORITY TO FORCE CONSOLIDATION WITH THIS FEELING WATER SYSTEMS. ADMITTEDLY THAT MAY BE IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THESE OTHER -- SMALL EVEN MY NEW SYSTEMS WHAT TWELVE OR TEN HOOK UPS WE DON'T HAVE ANY MUSCLE. TO FORCE THEM TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN GIVE THEM THE MONEY. HOW WOULD THAT OCCUR SO WHEN THE WATER BOARD IT LOOK FAT -- DIFFERENT WAYS TO SUPPORT OF THESE SYSTEMS ONE OF THE FIRST -- METHODS OF SUPPORT IS LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY ARE ALGO FOR CONSOLIDATION OR EXTENSION OF SERVICE SITES CAN WANT ONE OF THE PRIMARY -- WAVE TO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE WATER BOARD CONSIDERS BEFORE THEY WOULD CONSIDER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE CORRECT BUT THAT'S FOR I GET THAT I I I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE FOURTEEN HOOK UPS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEVEN OR EIGHT HOOK UPS OR SOMEBODY WHO JUST AS A WELL. THAT ADMITTEDLY HAS POOR GROUND WATER AND IS NOT POSSIBLE THEY THE THEY FALL INTO THIS MILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM TO ANYTHING. BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT WERE TAKING GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS IN MAKING I'M OF BAILABLE TO THEM. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. PLEASE REMEMBER THIRTY RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT GIVES US A STORY WE HAD UNDERSTAND THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE AND IN [inaudible] SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE. A METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I BELIEVE THE BILL ALSO ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL IS FOR THE WATER BOARD TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THESE COMMUNITIES TO SO THAT'S A GOOD LIST OF EXAMPLE WHERE. THERE MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE -- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED FOR THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS I MEAN THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY -- IT'S KIND OF A OF A IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL THAT IT'S VERY ON THE EACH. COMMUNITY MIGHT HAVE SOME UNIQUE NEEDS AND THAT'S WHERE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMES IN WHERE CONSOLIDATION MIGHT BE ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. OF IN THEN WHEN -- THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE WATER BOARD TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES -- IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROPER SOLUTION IS IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION. THE STATE HAS THAT ABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH JUSTICE BE AN ED -- OBJECTION FROM THESE LOCAL OPERATING SYSTEMS TO DELIVER THE SAFE DRINKING WATER THAT WE WE SEE WE SEE THAT WE WE WANT. AND THE LACK OF FUNDING SO THIS PROVIDES THE FUNDING THAT WOULD PROVIDE A POSSIBLE INCENTIVES THAT WOULD MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND THAT KEEPS ME TO THE NEXT IT PROVIDES FUNDING BUT DOESN'T YOU KNOW HI I'VE RAISE SOME QUESTIONS BEFORE ABOUT THE NEXUS BETWEEN AB THIRTY TWO THAT REQUIRES REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE LANGUAGE. THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED HERE TOO YOU KNOW -- IN TO INSERT CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALL THAT YOU'LL SAID KERR WITH CLIMATE CHANGE VERSUS THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GASES. I'M LOOKING AT PAGE SIX WORDS YOU NEED TO FIND CLIMB IS CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXASPERATING THE WATER IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES REDUCING SURFACE FLOWS. EXCEL RING DECLINING GROUNDWATER BASINS AND ALL THESE. SORT OF A CATCH ALL OF OF ALL THE ILLS AT ME OF KERR IN THE WATER ARENA -- BUT THAT DOESN'T. HYPHEN THE NEXUS BETWEEN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES -- AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU PUT IN HERE IN AB. ONE HUNDRED SORT OF KILLS ANY ANY HOPE THAT WE HAVE THAT AB. THIRTY TWO SURVIVED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'LL CONCEDE. REGRETTABLY THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BASED ON A. B. THREE NINETY EIGHT THAT OU'RE ABLE TO USE OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND FOR VARIETY DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT -- CHARGES BUT NOW WITH THIS LEGISLATION IT SEEMS THAT YOU WERE EXPANDING THE TYPE OF ACTIONS A GREENHOUSE GASES CAN BE. BE USED IMMEDIATELY IMMEDIATELY BEGINNING. ON THE ADOPTION OF THIS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND A CATCH ALL IS THERE ANYTHING IF THIS PASSES THAT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR GIVEN THE DEFINITION THAT WE HAVE COMPUTER. CONTAINED IN THIS IS APPARENTLY SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT THAT EXPANDS THE FOR THE POLICY THOUGH I A A JUST TO BE CLEAR I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE JUNE TWENTY FIRST VERSION OF THE BILL. WHICH IS THE BILL THAT IS CURRENTLY BEFORE BEFORE US. PURSUE SWITCH TODAY. WHAT WILL THE JUNE? YOUR REFERENCE TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WAS A REFERENCE TO A PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH WAS AMENDED ON JUNE TWENTY FIRST. WHICH WAS ON FRIDAY -- HAS -- MY HAS MORE NARAL LANGUAGE AND THAT'S THE BILL THAT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION NOW. AND THE LANGUAGE OF THAT IS CURRENTLY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. WOULD -- RESEARCH WOULD ALLOW OF A WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO THE APPROPRIATIONS OF THE SAFE AND FOR AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. AND BASICALLY ONLY IN THAT PARTICULAR APPROPRIATION OF COULD THE WATER BOARD EITHER -- DEMONSTRATED RESULTS. DEMONSTRATE A REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS OR DEMONSTRATE THAT IT ADDRESSES CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCY. AFFECTS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF A. B.. THREE NINETY EIGHT SO THAT'S THE CURRENT VERSION WERE TALKING ABOUT NOW WHICH IS A MORE NARROWLY CRAFTED -- LANGUAGE. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THERE BY. CENTER OFF. THE MANAGER I I SEE THAT THE I WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE CAN EXPECT A FOLLOW UP REPORT ON RESULTS. WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL ATION PLAN BUT IT LOOKS LIKE. THE FUND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT'S DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE WILL INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT EXPENDITURES FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS FUND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL ACTUALLY. OUTLINED A PLAN OF ACTION BEYOND ONE YEAR AT A TIME AND HAVE A TARGET DATE. AT WHICH POINT WE EXPECT THESE. SICK WATER SYSTEMS TO BE. TO BE WELL. ANOTHER WAS A GET WELL DAY. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S SOME PROGRAM IS TO SOME PLANNED. PLAN OF ACTION HERE WE JUST GOING. TO SPEND MONEY IN. SO AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENT OF THE PLAN IS TAT THEY OF THE TO ANNUALLY AND EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- IDENTIFY THE PRIOR YEAR'S VENTURES AND EVERYTHING WILL YEAR IDENTIFY THE PLANT LEVEL EXPENDITURES HOWEVER AS PART OF THAT THERE'S ALSO -- DATA COMPONENT THAT NEED TO BE INTEGRATED TO IDENTIFY WATER THOUGH THERE'S SYSTEMS THAT ARE EITHER ALREADY FEELING OR ARE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FAILING AND THEN AS PART OF THE PLAN IS IDENTIFYING THE SOLUTIONS TO THE REMEDY. THOSE ISSUES ONGOING RIGHT I CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT SOMEBODY TO DO SOME THINKING HERE AND FIGURE OUT THE WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OF WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE SICK. AND IT'S GOING TO COST US TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION A YEAR IT WILL TAKE US. NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. IT'S ASSUMING IT'S FIXABLE. AT SOME POINT TIME. AND THEN WE CAN PLAN ON NOT SPENDING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR YOUR ANYMORE RIGHT [inaudible] SO. JUST GO BACK TO THE THE ONE THE COMPONENT OF THE PLAN IS TO IDENTIFY THE ANTICIPATED NEED FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ARE FAILING OR AT RISK OF FAILING -- AS SO THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A LONGER TERM LOOK -- TO SEE WHAT THE WORLD IF YOU HAVE THE THREE UNDER FAILING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY IN PLACE WHAT IS THAT LEVEL THE NEEDED AND THE END OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITIZE. TO IDENTIFY WHAT WOULD BE THE PROGRAMMATIC EXPENDITURES IN THAT NEXT FISCAL YEAR BUT THERE IS A MORE HOLISTIC COMPONENT OF IDENTIFYING WHAT IS THAT GREATER NEED. WELL I DON'T SIT ON THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT IN THE FUTURE THE MATTER COMES BEFORE THE BIG BUDGET COMMITTEE I GUESS YOU CAN ANTICIPATE THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU WILL. GET FROM ME IN FUTURE YEARS. WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU FOR REMINDING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I SAID A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. NINE TWO ONE EIGHT NINE WHICH THE WORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND LEADERSHIP IN ACHIEVING THIS. MECHANISM TO REMEDY WHAT'S. AN IMMEDIATE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES ARE WATER DISTRICTS -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT NEXUS IN CLIMATE CHANGE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU IN FRONT OF US TODAY HAVE KNOWLEDGE% OF THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON THE WELL SYSTEMS THE BECOME STRESSED IN LEACH MORE CONTAMINANTS AS A RESULT OF DROUGHT IS THAT AN ACCURATE STATEMENT. YES AN ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SERGIO TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT. YES SO ON THE THE CLIMATE CHANGE -- IT DOESN'T ADD RESULT IN ADVERSE IMPACTS TO WATER AVAILABILITY AND WATER QUALITY -- AND BOTH AS A RESULT OF INCREASED -- IN PROLONGED NESS OF DROUGHT BUT AND ALSO ON THE OPPOSITE SPECTRUM -- MORE HEAVIER RAINFALL WHICH COULD ALSO RESULT AND GREATER FLOODING AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO TO DROUGHT WHEN THERE'S A INCREASED TEMPERATURE AND THERE'S LOWER PRECIPITATION IT COULD RESULT IN AN LONGER PERIODS OF DROUGHT -- WHICH RESULTS AND LET'S WATER AVAILABILITY AND A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF THE CONTAMINANTS WITHIN THE CURRENT WATER SOURCES AND AND MUCH OF IT ALSO IS NATURALLY OCCURRING CONTAMINANTS WHERE YOU JUST HAVE LESS AMOUNT OF WATER TO DILUTE. THE CONTAMINATED DURING THE DROUGHT PERIODS AND ALTHOUGH MANY COMMUNITIES WITH AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE TO RELY ON GROUND WATER SOURCES WHICH IN MANY CASES ARE CONTAMINATED. ON THE OPPOSITE SPECTRUM WITH THE FLOODING -- AS WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS -- THE TRAFFIC -- RAINFALL THAT HAPPENS IT'S ARE AFRAID OF TIME -- THAT FLOODING BRING THAN A LOT OF THE CONTAMINATION FROM THE SURFACE TO THE THAT DRINKING WATER AND SO -- THAT IS THE RESULT OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CHANGING AND TEMPERATURES AND CHANGING AND PRECIPITATION AS A RESULT OF THE TEMPERATURES. THANK YOU AND THEN. THE MEDIAN FOLLOW UP. I THINK YOU ANSWERED THIS WITH SENATOR ROTH'S QUESTION. BUT IT. THE BILL AS A FORCE IN THE TRAILER BILL DOES PRIORITIZE BUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEN LOOKING AT PRIORITIZING REMEDIES THAT ARE. BOTH MOST OF FICTION IN LEAST EXPENSIVE SO YOU MIGHT LOOK AT CONSOLIDATION YOU MIGHT LOOK AT A TREATMENT FACILITY -- YOU MIGHT EVEN LOOK AT EMERGENCY BOTTLED WATER TO CONTINUE TO GET A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER SET CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT YES. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. NIELSEN. DOES THIS SAID LEGISLATION IN THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AND I HAVEN'T REVIEW REVIEW THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THE BILL DOES IT. THE TALKS ABOUT RELATED TO DOMESTIC WELLS AND SOME MONEY MAY BE DIRECTED. TO HELPING WITH THE MYSTICAL PROBLEMS IS THAT CORRECT. THE WELLS ARE IN AN ELIGIBLE -- I USE THAT TO SUPPORT -- THE SMALLER SYSTEMS AND WELLSO THERE THERE'S A A BROADER USE NOW EVERYTHING WE HEAR THE WATER BOARD WOULD WORK WITH IS -- OBLIGATED BY THE REVIEW TO PRIORITIZE AND ADDRESS THE HIGH YOUTH NED BUT THERE IS A KIND OF A BROADER LEVEL OF WHAT'S A AVAILABLE USE OF THE FUND. DOES IT IN ANY WAY. EMPOWER THE WATER BOARD TO REGULATE CONTROL -- THESE DOMESTIC WELLS IN OTHER WORDS THE CAPACITY THE DOMESTIC WELL THE THE THE POPPING LIMITS ON THE HOURS. OF RUNING THE DOMESTIC WELL ANY ANY POWERS THAT ACCORDED TO THE BOARD TO GIVE THEM GREATER REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER. THE OPERATION. BY THE INDIVIDUAL OWNER OF THAT DOMESTIC WELL -- THE TRAILER BUT THE THOUGHT CONTAINING ADDITIONAL REGULATORY OKAY RATHER. WE NEED FOR THE QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION PUBLIC COMMENT AB. ONE HUNDRED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE QUEUED UP I'M GOING TO ASK EVERYONE TO LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO ABOUT A MINUTE AND FEEL FREE OF SOMEONE. IN FRONT OF YOU OF MAJOR POINT FEEL FREE TO SAY DITTO FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR MITCHELL CINDY TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB -- ONE HUNDRED JUST ONE QUICK COMMENT WE THINK THAT THIS IS THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION THERE IS ANOTHER BILL COMING FROM THE ASSEMBLY. THAT HAS A LOT OF SIMILAR LANGUAGE BUT SOME DIFFERENCES IT DOESN'T HAVE THE PRIORITIES THAT THIS BILL HAS THE PRIVATIZATION FOR HELPING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT ALSO WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE TO OUTSIDE OF MAKING SURE THEY'RE SAFE DRINKING WATER. SO WE THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT BILL THE BILL BFORE YOU TODAY WE ARE TONIGHT VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS.

AB ONE OH THREE HEALTH TRAILER BILL NUMBER [inaudible] TWO FINANCE. THIS IS THE SECOND HEALTH ON THE BUS TRAILER BILL WITH A COUPLE OF KEY CONSIDERATIONS FIRST IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL COMMISSION -- THIS COMMISSION IS DESIGNED -- CONSISTS OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS AND IS DESIGNED TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR UNIFIED HEALTHCARE FINANCING SYSTEM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SINGLE PAYER OPTIONS. THE COMMISSION A IS REQUIRED BY THIS TRAILER BILL TO PRODUCE TWO REPORTS THE FIRST BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS AN ANALYSIS OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. AND OPTIONS FOR TRANSITION TO A UNIFIED FINANCING SYSTEM AND THEN THE SECOND REPORT WOULD BE DUE ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE KEY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRANSITIONING TO A UNIFIED FINANCING SYSTEM. A COUPLE OF OTHER KEY ITEMS IN THIS BILL FIRST IS THE EXPANSION OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE TO UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE SECOND IS AN INCREASE FOR SENIORS AS WELL AS BLIND AND DISABLED -- FOR ME THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM GOING UP 2110038% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL THERE COUPLE OF HISTORICAL REASONS WHY THAT WASN'T THE CASE BEFORE. A THIRD IS THE EXTENSION -- FOR MENTAL HEALTH POST PARTUM BENEFITS FOR MOTHERS IN MEDI CAL FROM A SIXTY DAY PERIOD TO A ONE YEAR PERIOD. AND FINALLY FOR THE CMS BE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAMS NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT FUNDING THEY RIGHT NOW HAVE A VERY HEALTHY RESERVE -- SO THEY WOULD NOT RECEIVE THAT FUNDING UNTIL THEY GO DOWN TO A TWO YEAR RESERVE LEVELS AT WHICH POINT THE EXISTING A SPLIT WOULD CONTINUE IN TERMS OF FREE DIRECTION. SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN ITEMS AND HAPPY TO TAKEN QUESTIONS APPRECIATE THAT MEMBERS. SENATOR MORE LOCK. IT'S PENSION SWEEP FUNDED BY THE MULTI. I'M INSURANCE MANDATE SECRETARY OF THIS IS FOR WHICH PROVISION. JUST FOR THE FOR THIS PARTICULAR EVENT. SO THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT IS THAT THE PENALTY REVENUE WOULD BE USED FOR THE SUBSIDIES FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE OTHER HEALTHCARE OMNIBUS BILL -- BUT WE PASSED ALREADY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT YOU'RE WELCOME SENATOR DORADO [inaudible] YES. I SUPPORTIVE OF OF THE MAIL -- AND I THINK THAT THE BILL FAILS TO ADDRESS SOME KEY ISSUES. AT THE SAME TIME -- SOME OF US AGREE AND TRULY BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT -- BUT I THINK WE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE. A BASIC FAIRNESS BY NOT EXPANDING MEDICAL TO COVER ALL ADULTS ESPECIALLY OUR SENIORS -- THIS BODY SUPPORTED AS BE -- TWENTY NINE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO SENIORS THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN AB. ONE OH THREE UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS OF LIVED AND WORKED IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES BUT THEY ARE LEFT BEHIND. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. SENIORS ARE FORCED TO CONTINUE TO WORK LATER IN LIFE AND YET THEY'RE STILL CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY. OF AND I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED PAY TAXES. THEY PAID THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND YET THEY'RE CUT OUT. PREVENTED OF AND DOCTOR DOCTOR VISITS. SENIORS ON DOCUMENTS SENIORS MAKE UP ONLY THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ONLY. THIRTY THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA -- IT'S A SHAME THAT WE COULDN'T COVER THIS SMALL POPULATION. THIS YEAR. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND OUT OF THREE MILLION UNINSURED. IN THE TOTAL IN CALIFORNIA. OUR CONTINUES OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THIS UNTIL WE COVER AND TREAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THE SAME WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION -- OUR SENIORS CAN'T AFFORD MORE DELAYS FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. EVERY DAY -- EVERY DAY WE WAIT MEANS MORE EXPENSE OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS ESPECIALLY AS SENIORS -- AND SHORTER LIVES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE THEIR DIGNITY IN THEIR OLD AGE OLDER AGE [inaudible] OF I SEE THAT THAT THE CREATION FOR ME THE CREATION OF A TASK FORCE OR THE RENAMING OF A TASK FORCE. IS WERE PUTTING OFF THIS ISSUE AND WE'RE PUTTING IT OFF FOR YEARS TO COME -- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A A DAY TO BY JULY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR BY WHICH A REPORT IS EXPECTED. BUT THAT'S AFTER THE BUDGET IS APPROVED -- AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL COMMENT INTO THAT REPORT. SO THE WAY I SEE IT IS HERE'S A COMMISSION THAT WE'VE ASKED TO LOOK INTO THIS BUT THIS BODY HAS APPROVED IT -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU KNOW WHEREVER HOWEVER THE DECISION IS MADE TO PUT IT OFF INTO A COMMISSION WHICH IS KICKING IT DOWN THE ROAD FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A A BUREAUCRATIC -- YOU KNOW TOOL TO PUT THINGS OFF. BUT TO PUT THIS OFF FOR SENIORS WHO NEED THIS HEALTH CARE NOW IS UNCONSCIONABLE -- I I JUST -- I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULDN'T COVER FORTY THOUSAND MORE INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE THAT IS SO WEALTHY WE TALK ABOUT HOW WEALTHY WE ARE HELP. OUR ECONOMY IS THE FIFTH BEST IN THE WORLD AND WE COULDN'T INCLUDE FORTY THOUSAND SENIORS WHO NEED THAT COVERAGE NOW. WE TREAT ALL CALIFORNIANS THE SAME WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER LIFE AND DEATH THERE'S NO EXCLUSION ONE FIRST RESPONDERS GO TO A FIRE GO TO EMERGENCY THEY DON'T SAY LET ME SEE YOUR DOCUMENTS BEFORE I RESPOND BEFORE I TAKE CARE OF YOU. WE DON'T DO THAT WHEN IT COMES TO CLEAN WATER. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND I'M SURE THEN IN THOSE LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THERE ARE A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED. WE DON'T DO THAT WE DON'T EXCLUDE THE MOST LABOR LAWS -- SAFETY ON THE JOB WE DON'T EXCLUDE AND SAY SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS BEFORE WILL. AND FORCE THOSE LAWS AND THOSE RULES AND WHY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO EXCLUDE. BASED ON WHETHER YOU DOCUMENTED OR NOT WE LIVE TOGETHER WE GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER WE GO TO CHURCH TOGETHER OUR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IN THE SAME SCHOOLS. AND BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THE INCLUSION THEIR INTEGRATED THEY'RE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO SEGREGATE THEM OUT SOME WAY THINKING THAT WE'RE BETTER OFF BY DOING THAT. JUST MAKES ZERO ECONOMIC SENSE SO I'M DEEPLY DISTURBED BY PUTTING THE SOFT KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT THINKING ABOUT THOSE SENIORS A WHAT THEY NEED TODAY THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED THAT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE. IT'S JUST ONE VERY VERY SMALL PIECE. IN THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE STATE SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPRESS MY DISBELIEF AN YOU KNOW ANGER ANY MOTION AT THEM BEING EXCLUDED -- THROUGH THIS BILL SELECT RESPOND. HOW TO SAVE WE DEFINITELY HERE HERE THAT CONCERNED -- WE SHARE THE GOVERNOR'S EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO A STAGE WHERE EVERY PERSON IN THE STATE IS COVERED. AND SO THIS TRAILER BILL DOES SOME OF THAT IN MOVING FROM ASIA NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A WAY TO GO TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL [inaudible] THIRTY PAN. I THANK YOU -- FIRST OF ALL I DO ONE THING THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING STEPS WE ARE MAKING TODAY -- TO TRY TO WORK TOWARD -- THE GOAL OF A UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE MUTUAL OF COVERAGE. SO I WANTED KNOWLEDGE AND AND APPRECIATE AND THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR THAT HE DID PUT SOME MARKERS OUT THERE -- WE HAVE A GROUP THAT'S GONNA STUDY IT -- NOT AS FAR AS I THINK WE WILL LIKE TO WE IN THE SENATE DID PROPOSE -- SOME ADDITIONS -- THAT AND FOR NOT MAKE AN AGREEMENT BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE -- EX YOU KNOW EXPANDING TO AGE TWENTY FIVE ALTHOUGH I THINK. I WANTED ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALSO SAID HERE IN THE SENATE IN ADDITION TO THE SENIORS IS THAT WE WANT PEOPLE FALLING OFF OF COVERAGE SO WELL WE CERTAINLY THE RATE YOU KNOW IN THIS WE'RE GOING. TO HIT AND WE DID THE KIDS BEFORE AND WE HAD PEOPLE FALLING OFF ON THE HIT EIGHTEEN NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE UP TO TWENTY FIVE HOPEFULLY. IN FUTURE BUDGETS WE CAN. STAY AHEAD OF OF THAT -- AS WELL AS HOPEFULLY WE EVERY VISIT -- WHAT WE PROPOSED ORIGINALLY -- THE SENIORS AS WELL -- BUT I THINK IT ALSO COVERS SOME IMPORTANT GAPS TO INCLUDING -- YEAH THE THE SENIORS THE SENIOR GAP ANDS AND ALSO -- INCREASING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AS WELL SO -- I WOULD -- AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- WE HAD SOME THE GOSHEN AROUND THE CMS P. PROGRAM -- I UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY IS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SOMEONE AS A LARGE RESERVE BUT ALSO WANTED THE ADDED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED. TO BE SURE THOSE PROGRAMS -- DON'T ACTUALLY FAIL IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GONNA DRAW DOUBTS ARE RESERVISTS THAT. THAT'S A POINT WE HAVE TO PICK THEM UP AND YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE THE WHOLE -- ISSUE AROUND WELL THIS WAS LIKE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GIVE ME PEOPLE WE CAN ON OUR VARIOUS COVERAGE PROGRAMS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE -- PEOPLE MAY BE AFRAID SIGN UP WE NEED TO GIVE THEM SOME ALTERNATIVES AS WELL AND SOME OF THE SAME AS YOUR ROGRAMS ARE ARE ARE ARE TREATING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL SO. WE HAVE TO THINK THAT WE MAY NEED MULTIPLICITY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES -- ACCESS POINTS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED AND SO IT'S ONE OF THE MARKER THERE ON THAT SO THAT WE KNOW IN THE FUTURE OF THAT ONCE WE USE THOSE RESERVES WE DO NEED HELP SUPPORT THE COUNTIES TO HAVE THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SURE. WE CONTINUE THIS PROGRAMS WHEN ALL THIS PROGRAMS FAIL AND SAID WELL WELL WE KNOW BACK THEN WE DECIDED. TO DOWNTOWN SPEND RESERVE SO WITH THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP BEFORE WE HEAR FROM SENATOR SKINNER -- AND THEN FALL BY CENTER LEYVA QUICK QUESTION I'M LOOKING AT THE NEWLY MINTED LANGUAGE INTERSECTION TO THAT DEFINES THE APPOINTEES OF THE NEW COMMISSION. AND I SEE REFERENCE TOOL COMMITTEE -- OF POTENTIAL ADVISORS BUT THE GOVERNOR GETS EIGHT APPOINTMENTS I THINK THE SENATE GETS TO THE RULES COMMITTEE GETS -- TO AND I'M HOPING THAT IN CONSIDERATION OF THOSE APPOINTEES THAT -- IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES WILL ALSO BE CONSIDERED I HOPE THAT THAT THAT ISN'T THE EXPECTATION OF THE ADVISORY KIND OF ARM BUT THE ACTUAL VOTING COMMISSIONERS. ON THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER AMONG THOSE A THE POINTY APPOINTEES -- IMPACT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS EITHER -- FOLKS WHO RUN CLINICS BUT IMPACT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT JUST MY LITTLE SUGGESTIONS THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER FOLLOWED BY LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS -- WE IF FOR ME ANYWAY OUT IT HAD PREFERENCE FOR THERE TO BE A LITTLE MORE BALANCE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE APPOINTMENTS AND THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS JUST -- TOM CLEARLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN WORKING ON VARIOUS PROPOSALS TO GET UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE FOR SOME. TIME NOW SOME OF WHICH BEEN SUCCESSFUL SOME OF WHICH NOT -- FIVE BUT I REALIZE THE BILL IS AS DESCRIBED NOW I HOPE THAT WE WOULD LOOK IN THE FUTURE FOR HELP PERHAPS SUGGESTING THOSE APPOINTMENTS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE CHEERS CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT IMPACTED COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED BUT ALSO THERE MIGHT BE MORE LEGISLATIVE BALANCE. BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I WANTED ALSO FOLLOW UP FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES COMMENT SENATOR DRAWS WAS AROUND -- THIS ISSUE OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WHO. ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL AND WHO THE SENATE WANTED TO HAVE INCLUDED. AND I THINK THAT IS WORTH IT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DO SOME. ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE COST IS OF THIS EXCLUSION WELL WE FULL WELL KNOW WHAT THE COST IS OF INCLUDING BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT IT. COSTS FOR MEDI CAL -- FOR OF CERTAIN AGE. I THINK THAT. THE COST FOR THE EXCLUSION COULD BE QUIZ TYPE NOT HIGHER. PARTLY BECAUSE THESE FOLKS WILL NOW BE DEPENDENT ON EMERGENCY ROOM CARE THAT'LL BE THE ONLY REAL CARE -- AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT IN ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS ANYTIME WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT COVERED. IN DATE THEN. DELAY BEING TREATED. FOR ANY TYPE OF CONDITION. THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S COMMUNICABLE AND THERE COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS THERE'S NO VACCINATIONS FOR MURSI'S STAPH INFECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE LOTS OF FOUR TWO WELL THERE'S VACCINATIONS FOR TUBERCULOSIS THERE IS -- THERE IS NOT RIGHT IT'S LIMITED VERY. YEAH THIRDS NOT -- AVAILABLE IT'S LIMITED AND WE SEE WITHIN OUR LOWER INCOME POPULATIONS AND A RISE IN TUBERCULOSIS -- THERE'S LOTS OF CONDITIONS THAT. WOULD THAT IN FACT THREATEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE REST OF US BY ARE NOT COVERING HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE. ADDITIONALLY WE ALREADY HAVE. NOT BY ACTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT BUT BY ACTIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAVE SO MUCH FEAR IN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY NOW WE'RE TALKING FEAR IN MORE THAN JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED. AS I WAS DRIVING TO THE CAPITAL TODAY. I LISTEN TO REPORT ON A STUDY DONE BY UC BERKELEY OF CHILDREN. OF NOTED I ROOM IN CHILDREN SHOULD SAY SONS AND DAUGHTERS SO THESE ARE ADULTS. OF THEIR US CITIZENS BUT THEY ARE. THEIR PARENT IS LIVING WITH THEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A PARENT THAT'S UNDOCUMENTED. THOSE PEOPLE ARE OWN US CITIZENS WHAT THE RIVER. RESEARCH SHOWED THEIR STRESS LEVELS THEIR ANXIETY LEVELS. AFFECTING SLEEP AFFECTING MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR HEALTH OUR WAY UP BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR FOR THEIR FAMILY. WE KNOW NOW THAT MANY OF OUR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AGAIN THEY MIGHT ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON IN THEIR FAMILY WHOSE UNDOCUMENTED. ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ANY GOVERNMENT SERVICES FOR THE FEAR. THAT -- THAT IS BEING THAT IS BEEN PROVOKED NOW BY THESE THREATS FOR IMMIGRATION ACTION. YOU ARE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IF YOU HAVE NO HEALTH CARE. THEN YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO USE YOUR MEDI CAL BECAUSE AT LEAST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZED YOU. AND MADE YOU. A A LEGAL USER SO YOU MAY HAVE LESS FEAR ABOUT GOING AND SEEKING OUT HEALTH CARE WHERE AS NOW THERE MAY BE EVEN GREATER BECAUSE EVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT IS BASICALLY NOT RECOGNIZING YOU AND PROVIDING YOU HEALTH CARE. SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT TO MENTION TO OUR CONVERSATION AND HOPE THAT WE CAN REMEDY IT IN -- THIS UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. A GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL -- BUT I WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE SENATOR TO RAZA THOSE COMMENTS. WE ALL WORK HERE AND WE SERVICE OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE CONSTITUENTS THAT ROUTE WE WE REPRESENT BUT I KNOW WE ALL HAVE PEOPLE WHO -- KIND OF ARE SOUNDING BOARDS FOR ME ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE AS MY MOM. AND YOU KNOW SHE'S A SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN MY DAD'S A SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN AND THEY ARE BOTH. ALMOST RETIRED THEY CHOOSE THE WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT. TO BUT THEY'RE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE AND WHEN MY MOM SAID TO ME TWO WEEKS AGO. HONEY WHY WOULD THAT HELP IN Y. WITH THOSE THE OLDER PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST WHY WOULD THEY BE EXCLUDED AND YOU KNOW SHE'S THINKING OF HERSELF AND SHE'S THINKING OF MY DAD. AS I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL ISSUES. AND I ALSO THINK ABOUT WHEN I WAS WITH THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND IN THE TWENTY YEARS THAT WE BARGAINED CONTRACTS. EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL THE CORPORATIONS WANTED TO ELIMINATE RETIREE HEALTH CARE EVERY SINGLE TIME AND WE HAD A FIGHT SO HARD TO KEEP THAT IN THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN US ALL A GOOD DAYS OF THEIR LIFE. TO MAKE THE COMPANY BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA BETTER SO I JUST THINK THAT WE OWE THEM SOMETHING AND I TO FEEL THAT HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND IT'S NOT A PRIVILEGE. SO I DO HOPE THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY IT IS IN A HUGE GROUP -- BUT THE LONGER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CARE THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS FOR ALL OF US THANK YO THANK YOU. MISTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MA'AM CHAIR I'M GONNA. THE VERY BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS TALKING ABOUT ISSUES OF THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA COMMISSION. NUMBER ONE MADAM CHAIR I DO THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE AND I KNOW THAT. NOT ALL OF US AGREE THAT'S FINE BUT I THINK CALIFORNIANS ONE A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM IN THE STATE. IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IS BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY NUMBER ONE WHAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE INTO THE CHALLENGES. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WERE TAKING A PRE EXISTING FIVE MEMBER COMMISSION IN TRANSITION INTO THE FOURTEEN MEMBER COMMISSION WITH THAT PRE EXISTING BUDGET AS WELL THAT FIVE MILLION THOSE ORIGINALLY THE BUDGET THINK LAST YEAR IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY SO I I THINK ON SOME OF THE TIME LINE SO WE HAVE THE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THEN THE SECOND TIME I JULY FIRST TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SUCH A SIGNIFICANT TOPIC -- THOSE ARE TOUGH TO BE ABLE TO HIT. IN SO A MAN CHAIR I THINK IT WOULD BE -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS OF GETTING -- A REALISTIC IDEA OF WHAT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DELIVERED VIA THIS BILL BUT TO BE ABLE TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT INCLUDES ALL THE OPTIONS BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY IT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH HAUL -- SO I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THAT JUST HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DEVELOP A REALISTIC TIME LINE TO BE ADDED TO THE WORK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ENSURE THAT A SYSTEM IS GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL. AND ESPECIALLY FOR MOVING TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM I THINK WE OWE IT. TO ALL OF US IN THE VOTERS IN THAT RESIDENTS THE STATE TO BE TO DO IT RIGHT -- AND NOT NECESSARILY FAST BECAUSE IT'S WHAT THEY WANT TEN DISCONNECTED TO GET YOUR FEEDBACK ON THIS IS FOR TAKING A PRE ESTABLISHED COMMISSION TRANSITION IT THANK YOU BY THE WAY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO START A VALUE IN SINGLE PAYER I SUPPORTED. NO THAT SOME DON'T THAT'S FINE BUT I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT TOUGH QUICKTIME MY I'LL MAKE A COUPLE THREE POINTS IN AN ATOM MAY ONE AWAY AND ALSO I THINK FIRST -- GOVERNOR SHARES THAT PRIORITY AND IT'S WHY YOU WANT TO RECONSTITUTE THIS COMMISSION IN THIS WAY. AND MAKE SOME THE TRADE OFFS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY HOPEFULLY A LITTLE BIT EASIER IN THE FUTURE TO MAKE AS WE MOVE TOWARD BEING ABLE TO COVER EVERYBODY. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC TIME LINES IT IS AN AMBITIOUS TIMELINE BY THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE THAT YOU A POINT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY REALLY SPEARHEADING THE COMMISSION AND DRIVING IT FORWARD. WE HAVE THESE DEADLINES IN STATUTES WE KNOW WE HAVE TO MEET THEM AND THE WAY THAT THE DEADLINES WERE STAGGERED OUT THERE WAS A PURPOSE BEHIND IT WHICH IS THAT THE FIRST DEADLINE -- I KNOW AND I KNOW THIS TAX THEY SEEM LIKE THEY SOUND A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR BUT THE FIRST IN LINE IS REALLY FOR AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM. AND AND DEVELOPING SOME OPTIONS YES AND THEN THE SECOND DEADLINE -- THAT'S REALLY THE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS SO WHEN YOU'RE IMAGINING WHAT THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL LOOK LIKE AND SO BETWEEN THOSE TWO DEADLINES ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT MONTHS SO WE THINK WOULD THAT TIME LINE ALTHOUGH IT IS AMBITIOUS WE WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME IMPORTANT OPTIONS. IN ANY OF THIS IS GOING TO GO WITHOUT SAYING TO BE MY LAST POINT MADAM CHAIR IS IF WE'RE IF THE GOVERNOR SERIOUS ABOUT GOING TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE LOOK AT FOLKS WHO ARE SERIOUS ABOUT. DOING A DEEP DIVE AND WILLING TO GO TO GET US THERE -- AND THAT'S WHERE I GET WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT -- AT TIMES THIS IS BEEN REALLY SCARY FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO JUMP OFF INTO A AND WE'RE GONNA NEED THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE RIGHT SEATS AND I HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE. WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT -- AND NOT JUST THROW UP SOME ADDITIONAL UP SCHOOLS JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT. BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST PUT A WINDOW DRESSING OUT THERE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR TAKES THIS VERY SERIOUSLY IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HE'S THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME HE CAMPAIGNED ON IT SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING IT'LL BE A KEY PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR TIME IF YOU WORK ON THIS THANK.
