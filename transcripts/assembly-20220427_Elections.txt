BEFORE MOVING ON TO OTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA WITH THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS OUT OF THE WAY WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA. IT. WHAT. THE NUMBER GOOD MORNING MORNING THANK YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY- THANK YOU- CHAIR BRIAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE AND- MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ACCOMMODATING ME THIS MORNING I'VE GOT A CHILD CARE ISSUE AT HOME NEED TO GET BACK HOME TO TAKE CARE OF MY- ON MY LITTLE ONE- LAST YEAR- CALIFORNIA WAS AT RISK OF MAKING A VERY UNDEMOCRATIC CHOICE. AS THE RECALL PROCEEDED MANY OF US PROTESTED THE IDEA THAT THE LEADER OF THE MOST POPULOUS STATE THE NATION COULD BE ELECTED BY LESS THAN A MAJORITY OF VOTERS THAT WHILE WE AVOIDED THE WORST OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM THAT LEAD US THERE IS STILL IN PLACE THAT'S WHY WE INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION. ACTING FUTURE RECALL CANDIDATES UNDER SYSTEM. THAT ENSURES A CLEAR WINNER SUPPORTED BY THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS. THE BEST WAY TO GUARANTEE ELECTING A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE IS TO ENSURE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES RUNNING REPRESENTS A COHORT. OF VIABLE SERIOUS AN ACTIVE CANDIDATES. OF THE FIFTY FOUR CANDIDATES WHO FILED TO FILL THE VACANCY. WOULD GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAVE BEEN RECALLED. IN MY OPINION ONLY A HANDFUL WERE SERIOUS THOUGHTFUL CANCER WOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO GOVERN AT THE STATE. THE CURRENT POLITICAL SYSTEM IS TRANSCANADA'S WHO FUNDRAISE OFF THE DEFENSIVE TWEETS WHILE UNDERCUTTING FAITH AND ARE LIKE TROLLS SYSTEM. THIS EXIST BECAUSE OUR ELECTORAL SSTEM IS SET UP TO REWARD THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR ONCE YOU GET RID OF THE ABILITY TO WIN WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE THERE ISN'T AN INCENTIVE TO ABUSE THE RECALL PROCESS AS WE SAW LAST YEAR EXTREME CANDIDATES CAN'T WIN A FAIR RACE IN THE STATE BUT THE RECALL PROCESS. IS NOT FAIR. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT AMERICA IS. A SHINING CITY ON A HILL BUT THE TRUTH IS WHERE. I'M NOT PERFECT- OUR DEMOCRACY IS NOT PERFECT AND IT'S OUR OUR JOB- AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES BOTH HERE IN THE STATE- AND- BACK IN. IN WASHINGTON DC TO WORK TOWARDS. A MORE PERFECT UNION- IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM. TO GET US TO OUR PREFERRED CANDIDATE- THAT IS OUR CHARGE- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO HAVE WORKED- I TIRELESSLY. THE LAST YEAR BUT FOR. FOR BUT DECADES FRANKLY TO TRY TO FIX THE SYSTEM OF GOT A COUPLE OF THEM- WITH ME AT TODAY. WITH THAT I'LL INTRODUCE A ROBBIE ROBINETTE THE WITH BETTER CHOICES DOT VOTE AND CHAD PEACE WITH THE INDEPENDENT VOTER PROJECT- HELLO MY NAME IS RAVI ROBINETTE I'M DIRECTOR OF BETTER CHOICES ABOUT THAT- GERMAN. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY ONE GROUP FORMS THE RECALL PROCESS TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING ABUSED BY FRINGE CANDIDATES THAT WOULD HAVE NO REAL CHANCE ARE NORMAL ACTION HYPERPARTISAN CANDIDATES CAN WIN A CROWD OF PRO PLAYER OUTING AND THEY KNOW IT THIS CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR THESE CANDIDATES TO ABUSE THE RECALL PROCESS. AT BEST THIS WASTE TIME AND ENERGY AND AT WORST IT CAN ELECT TO GOVERNOR OPPOSED BY THE MONTH MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. WE CHOSE CONSENSUS ARE INSTEAD OF INSTANT RUNOFF BECAUSE INSPIRON OFFICE ALSO VULNERABLE TO MANIPULATION BY HYPERPARTISAN CANDIDATES. THEY CAN ALWAYS SQUEEZE OUT OR BRACKET A MORE REPRESENTATIVE CANDIDATE. CONSENSYS RCB LOOKS AT EACH CANDIDATE AND COMPARES THEM TO EACH OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN A ROUND ROBIN FASHION. THE CANDIDATE. DO WHO DEFEATS EACH OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES WHEN COMPARED ONE ON ONE IS THE WINNER. INSTANT RUN OFF. INSTANT RUN OFF REQUIRES. ELECTRONIC FORMS OF NEARLY ALL OF THE BALLOTS IN ORDER TO BEGIN THE ELIMINATION PROCESS THAT USES TO DETERMINE THE WINNER. IF MORE VOTES COMING AT THE ELIMINATION PROCESS BEGINS BEFORE MORE VOTES COME IN AS POSSIBLE TO ALTER. WHO SHOULD BE ELIMINATED AND RESULT CAN CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT SHIPS IN THE OUTCOME. CONSENSYS RCV IS SIMPLY A SERIES OF TWO CANDIDATE RACES AS NEW BALLOTS COMMENT THE VOTE TOTALS IN EACH OF THESE RACES CONVERGE TO AN OUTCOME CONVERGE TO RESULT JUST LIKE THEY DO TODAY. AS THERE'S NO THERE ARE NO CHEFS IN THE TOTALS AS THE ROOT ROOT AS- AS THE MORE BUT CERTAIN COUNTY. CONSENSUS RCV EXTENDS THE POWER OF THE TWO CANDIDATE RACE TO A LARGER GROUP OF CANDIDATES ARE USING RANKED CHOICE BALLOTS TO DETERMINE THE WINNER IN ONE ON ONE CONTEST BETWEEN EACH POSSIBLE PAIR CANDIDATES. THE CONTENTS AS RCB FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE CANDIDATES BEST STRATEGY. BECAUSE EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES IN EVERY DECISION. THE CANDIDATES MUST REPRESENT ALL OF THE PLAYERS NOT JUST THEIR PARTY'S VOTERS AND NOT JUST THEIR PRIMARY VOTERS. CONSENSUS DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY VOTER GETS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE CONSENSUS MEANS THAT THE CANDIDATE WHO REPRESENTS REPRESENTS ALL OF THE VOTERS WILL WIN THE ELECTION. I THINK STATURE. WITH THE CHINESE ADVISER TO THE INDEPENDENT VOTER PROJECT FIRST ON THE THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR HAVING US TODAY IN THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT RISK COMMITTEES GET AND BILL I PLATE SHOULD SAY HEY PASS THIS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WELL.

THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS. AB SIXTEEN SIXTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER NGUYEN MORNING. THANKS FOR JOINING I THINK THE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTIETH GENERAL ELECTION NEARLY EIGHTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS CASTOR BALLOTS MOSTLY BY MAIL WITH THE RECENT ENACTMENT OF SB THIRTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WILL RECEIVE A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT FOR LOCAL AND STATE ELECTION AND WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN IT EITHER THROUGH THE MAIL WHAT A COUNTY XCELLIS DROP OFF LOCATION. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TO ENTIRELY VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS TICKETS AB TAKE EVERY STEP NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THESE BALLOTS ARE RETURNED TO THE REST OF VOTERS. EVERY CALIFORNIA READ DESERVES TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR STATE PROCESS AND ALSO CONFIDENT THAT THEIR VOTE WILL COUNT. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES ELECTION OFFICIALS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES ELECTION OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY A BALLOT. I AM SEARCHING NO FIVE VOTERS AT THE BALLOT THEY HAVE RETURNED IS UNSIGNED OR IF THE SIGNATURES DOES NOT MATCH. THERE'S NO SUCH REQUIREMENT FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY A VOTER IF THE BALLOT OR BALLOT ENVELOPE AS RETURNED DAMAGED. MY BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE SAME NOTIFICATION PROCESS FOR ANY VOTE BY MAIL ENVELOPE THAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE LECTION OFFICIALS IS RECEIVED. IT DAMAGE CONDITION OR SHOW SIGNS OF DAMAGE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SIGNIFICANT RIPS TEARS OR ANY ATTEMPTS TO UNSEAL OPEN OR BE SUED THE OFFICIAL VOTE BY MAIL ENVELOPE. AT NO POINT IS ANY VOTER DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE OR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX. IF VOTERS KNOW FIVE ABOUT ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THEIR BALLOT ELECTION OFFICIALS WILL PROVIDE ADVICE ON HOW TO CORRECT THE ISSUES INCLUDING VOTING WITH THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT AT A POLLING PLACE OPTING TO RECEIVE IN THE BALLOT IN THE MAIL. THERE ARE OPPOSITIONS TO THIS BILL. THE LETTERS WE RECEIVED WERE BEFORE OUR- EFFORT TO ALSO AMEND THE BILL PER THEIR OPPOSITION THE OPPOSITION ALL. TALKED ABOUT AT THE MEETING OF TEMPERING OF THE AVALON. WE HAVE TO CHANGE IT TO USING THE DEFINITION OF A DAMAGE. INSTEAD OF WHICH AS MENTIONED EARLIER IS DAMAGE SHOW SIGNS OF DAMAGE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SIGNIFICAN RIPS TEARS OR ANY ATTEMPTS AND STILL OPEN A ECENT DEFICIENT. BUT BY MAIL ENVELOPED. I ASKED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ABSOLUTELY SAYING NO PRIMARY WITNESSES AND PORT I DO SEE WE HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION RESTORE ROSE. MISS ROSE GOOD MORNING MORNING. RIGHT GOOD MORNING. TO RUN MEMBERS AMADOR ROSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECTFUL BUT QUITE STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE HAVE HERE WE BELIEVE IS REALLY A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT VOTER FRAUD IS VANISHINGLY RARE AND THIS IS TRUE EVEN IN THE STATES THAT HAVE. LARGELY ADOPTED ALMOST ALL VOTE BY MAIL LIKE LIKE OREGON FOR EXAMPLE INSTEAD OF PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS AB SIXTEEN SIXTY WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS THERE ARE A LOT OF INNOCENT REASONS WHY FILE ENVELOPES MIGHT ARRIVE IN ELECTIONS OFFICES IN IN PERFECT CONDITION WITH THINGS THAT ARE CITED AS SIGNS OF DAMAGE IN THE BILL AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE BUT WE DON'T THINK THEY FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THESE THESE ISSUES THAT CONCERN US SO GREATLY. SO USPS MAIL SORTERS THINK INCREASE THEY CAN MARK THEY CAN EVEN RIP ENVELOPES RIGHT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES THEY THEY WILL OPEN THEIR BACKUP CORRECT THE MISTAKE SEE WHAT BACK UP WITH TAPE I'VE DONE THAT THAT SORT OF THING THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE DAMAGE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL WITH THIS BILL- WHILE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT DAMAGE CAUGHT. THERE'S NO CLEAR DEATH. IN THE BILL AS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY DAMAGE SO. THAT LACK OF A CLEAR DEFINITION WE BELIEVE- CREATES A REAL PROBLEM. SO BECAUSE OF THIS EVERY ACCOUNT WOULD HAVE TO USE THEIR OWN DISCRETION A RECIPE FOR INCONSISTENT APPLICATION THAT WOULD. TELL UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR ELECTIONS AND THE CURA CON TOOK THE PROCESS IT'S CONTEMPLATED BY THE BILL WOULD NOT LEAVE TIME. FOR MOST PEOPLE TO CAST A REPLACEMENT BALLOT PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTION. AND THEN THE BILL PROHIBITS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS FROM COUNTING THE BALLOT IF THE ENVELOPES PERCEIVED TO BE DAMAGED SO. HONESTLY CAN YOU IMAGINE VOTERS REACTIONS IF THEY SIGN THEIR BALLOT THEY TAKE THE TIME TO FILL OUT A VERY LONG BALLOT THEY GET EVEN IN TIME. AND THEN EVERYTHING IS RIGHT. AND THEN THEY GET A NOTIFICATION LATER THAT THEIR BALLOT WASN'T COUNTED COUNTED BECAUSE IT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE DAMAGED. I THINK HERE WOULD BE. IT VERY RIGHTEOUS OUTRAGE IN THAT SIR KIND CIRCUMSTANCE FINALLY TAMPERING ALREADY ILLEGAL RIGHT COUNTIES HAVE LEGAL PROCESSES IN PLACE TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE TEMPERING AND GIVEN THE RARITY OF THE PROBLEM IT'S CLEAR THAT THE WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IS SUFFICIENT. ELECTIONS OFFICIALS REPROCESSING BALLOTS THAT SHOW SIGNS OF VEGAN UNDEFINED DAMAGE WOULD CAUSE VALVO TO BE REJECTED AND IT'S A DRACONIAN OF RESPONSE TO A PROBLEM THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN SHOWN TO EXIST SO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS MUST RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON IT. THANK YOU TO. TESTIMONY IN THE ROOM AS ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER THEIR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE WE WILL NUMBER TO THE PHONE LINES OPERATOR CAN OPEN UP PHONE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO REGISTER THEIR- NAME ORGANIZATION A POSITION ON THE BILL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN. AS MENTIONED AT NO POINT IN THIS BILL THAT THE CALIFORNIA BORDER ARE BEING DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE OR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX. IF THE VOTERS NOTIFY ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THEIR BALLOTS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WOULD PROVIDE ADVICE ON HOW TO CORRECT THE ISSUE INCLUDING BOATING WITH ONE IN. THE BALLOT AT A POLLING PLACE. FOR TO OPT IN TO RECEIVING THE BALLOT IN THE MAIL. AS MENTIONED THE WORD TAMPERING WAS THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE ALL THE OPPOSITIONS WE REMOVE THE WORD AND WE NOW HAVE USED DEVOID DAMAGE. I WISH I BET RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN'S VOTERS. IN MAKING THIS AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT IT IS ABOUT A DAMAGE ENVELOPE THAT IF YOU. THE BACHELOR VOTERS SEES IT. IF AGAIN IF IT HAS SIGNIFICANT RIPS TEARS OR ANY ATTEMPTS TO UNSEAL OPENER RECEIVED OFFICIAL VOTE BY MAIL HELLO THE VOTER IS NOTIFIED. THE VOTER CAN EASILY TELL THE REST OF VOTERS ONCE THEY NOTIFY.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- QUORUM IS NOT PRESENT SO WE WILL VOTE ON IT SHORTLY I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL I THINK IT MIGHT BE A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AS WAS MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY WAYS- THAT A VOTE BY MAIL ENVELOPE COULD BE ACCIDENTALLY DAMAGED. AND VOTERS LEGITIMATELY MAKE MISTAKES AND THEY TRY TO CORRECT THEM AND IN THOSE INSTANCES THOSE VOTES WON'T BE COUNTED- QUICK ENOUGH BEFORE THE ELECTION CLOSES I ANSWER THOSE FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT WE WILL HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE VOTE ASSUMING IT GETS A MOTION NOW WHEN WE HAVE A CORE. YES MAY I RESPOND TO THAT MISTER. I THINK I GET THE LAST WORD RESPECTFULLY. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. I THINK THAT STAY HERE YES. OKAY THE FOURTEENTH WITH YOUR REGULAR NUMBER YEAH. YOUR OTHER WITNESSES IS ON THE PHONE C. AS A MEMBER WE'RE GONNA AHEAD AND CALL THE ROLL ESTABLISHED FORMER HERE SAY ARE TELL BANDIT. HERE BENNETT HERE LOW LOW HERE MAYES PLEASE LEAVE HERE BLANCA RUBIO. WE HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY REAFFIRMS A FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF THIS NATION AND PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S DEMOCRATIC SELF GOVERNMENT FROM FOREIGN PRINCIPLES AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I WOULD LIMIT THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ENTITIES WHO OWN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SHARES IN THE US SPACE CORPORATION FROM BEING ABLE TO EXERT INFLUENCE OVER OUR ELECTIONS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL. A CORPORATION WILL BE DEEMED A FOREIGN INFLUENCE IF A FOREIGN ENTITY PARTICIPATE IN DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO STATE OR LOCAL PARK POLITICAL SPENDING OR- OR 1% OF SHARES ARE OWNED BY A SINGLE. FOREIGN INVESTOR 5% ARE OWNED BY MULTIPLE FOR INVESTORS SHORTLY AFTER THE TWENTY TEN CITIZENS UNITED RULING THEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WARNED IN THE STATE OF THE UNION. THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD OPENED THE DOOR TO FOREIGN MONEY IN U. S. ELECTIONS DURING THAT SPEECH JUSTICE ALITO'S INFAMOUSLY TOOK HIS HEAD AND MOUTH NOT TRUE HOWEVER. TWELVE YEARS LATER WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THIS HOLDS TRUE AS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WARNED FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN U. S. COMPANIES HAVE SKYROCKETED RECENTLY. YEARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO FOREIGN INVESTORS OWN ONLY ABOUT 5% OF ALL US CORPORATE EQUITY BY NICK TWENTY NINETEEN THAT NUMBER JUMPED TO FORTY PERCENT. WHILE FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE PROHIBITED BY FEDERAL LAW FROM SPENDING MONEY TO INFLUENCE U. S. ELECTIONS THERE IS A BIG LOOPHOLE BEING EXPLOITED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AND US SHARES OF CORPORATIONS. OWNING OF SHARES. YOUR CORPORATION CAN AMOUNT TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH. DIRECT LINES TO CEO AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE STOCKHOLDER MOTIONS. THIS POLICY REFORM IS NEEDED AND BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS AT THROUGHOUT OTHER STATES LEGISLATURES INCLUDING NEW YORK MASSACHUSETTS MINNESOTA HAWAII AND OREGON MOST RECENTLY THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THE TENTH LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY. AND MY HOME CITY VOTED TO MOVE FORWARD TO DRAFTING A SIMILAR FORM TO AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT FOR INFANTS CORPORATE SPENDING. AND ALSO OF COURSE INFAMOUS ARE FAMOUSLY THE CITY OF SEATTLE HAS PASSED THEIR ONE SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. AS WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD SAUDI ARABIA HAS ANNOUNCED EARLY THIS YEAR THEY PLAN TO INVEST TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE COMPANY'S MORE THAN DOUBLING ITS ASSETS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS SUCH AS WHEN AND- BLAVATNIK HAVE A TIED TO HAVE BEEN TIED TO MILLIONS. OF DOLLARS IN CONTRIBUTIONS INFORMED TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS AND A SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND OF NORWAY HAS A STAKE IN AROUND ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED COMPANIES WITHIN AVERAGE HOLDING OF ONE POINT 4% OF ALL CHAIRS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS HAVE USED THEIR MONEY AND POWER TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS ADVANCE ENGINES IN THEIR FAVOR. IT IS TIME WE PUT AN END TO FOREIGN ACTORS USING THEIR POWER AND WEALTH TO INFLUENCE CALIFORNIA'S MARCUS IT IS THE PULSE. I WOULD THAT I COULD USE MY TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITH ME I'VE DOOR ROSE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS AND THE PHONE. WILL HAVE COURTNEY HOSTETLER SENIOR COUNSEL FOR FEES FREE SPEECH FOR PEOPLE ARE CALLING IN FROM WASHINGTON DC. THANK YOU MISTER LEE MISS ROSE LONG TIME NO SEE. C. DOOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR LEGAL CAL HERE IN SOME OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SO THE LYNC BELIEVES THAT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS AND OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM OVERALL REALLY. SHOULD PRIORITIZE VOTERS RIGHT NOT BIG MONEY NOT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM SHOULD MAXIMIZE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS IT SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM WHICH TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. IT SHOULD ALSO WORK TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR- FOR EQUITABLE COMPETITION IN ELECTIONS CITIZENS UNITED AS AS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAH INDICATED HAS HAS CREATED THIS LOOPHOLE RIGHT ONE THAT ALLOWS FOREIGN INVESTORS TO CIRCUMVENT LAWS AGAINST POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH SECURING CORPORATE. OWNERSHIP INTERESTS A LOOPHOLE THAT HAS ENJOYED DRAMATICALLY INCREASED- USE RECENT YEARS WITH RAPIDLY EXPANDING FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN US COMPANIES FOREIGN INFLUENCED CORPORATIONS HAVE BY DO SHERRY RESPONSIBILITIES RIGHT THEY ARE ANSWERABLE TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS SAY DO NOT CENTER THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS. ARE ELECTIONS HAVE GOT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT SKEWED TOWARD FOREIGN INTERESTS. IT WE ARE EXPERIENCING A REAL CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY. AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IT'S FED BY MISSING DISINFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PERPETRATED TO A VERY DISTURBING DEGREE BY CERTAIN FOREIGN POWERS. MONEY IN POLITICS AS A CORRUPTING INFLUENCE IN ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CORRECTIONS REALLY MAGNIFIED WHEN CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ALLOWED TO INFLUENCE ELECTIONS BY INVESTING IN US COMPANIES. AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN PROHIBITS CORPORATIONS WITH CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF FOREIGN PRINCIPAL OWNERSHIP OR YOU KNOW WERE FOREIGN ENTITIES PARTICIPATE IN POLITICAL SPENDING DECISIONS FOR MAKING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES SO THE LOSURE OF THE CITIZENS UNITED LOOPHOLES GOING TO HELP AVOID POLITICAL MANIPULATION BY FOREIGN INFLUENCED CORPORATIONS IT'LL PRESERVE PUBLIC TRUST. IN OUR ELECTIONS IN OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO PREVENT WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW IT'LL PROTECT THE REPRESENTATIVE NATURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT'S GONNA DO SO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. FIVE VOTE ON AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS ROSE WHEN I MOVE ON TO MISS. HOSTETLER. MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. HI DEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL AB EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS FROM FOREIGN INFLUENCE. CURRENTLY FEDERAL IN CALIFORNIA ALLOWED YOU TO PROHIBIT FOREIGN ENTITIES FROM SPENDING ANY MONEY ZERO DOLLARS INFLUENCE U. S. ELECTIONS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. BUT CURRENTLY THE SAME ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY FOREIGN PRINTABLES FOR LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNIT EIGHT. CAN STILL INFLUENCE ELECTION BY INVESTING IN THE US COMPANIES THAT CAN THEN. UNLIMITED DOLLARS ON A LOT OF TRIMMING NORMA CORPORATE TREASURY. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MENTIONED AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHTEEN INCLUDES THE FOOTBALL IT WOULD PROHIBIT FOR PROFIT FOREIGN INFLUENCE BUSINESS ENTITIES FROM SPENDING MONEY ON CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS. EITHER COMPANIES IN WHICH SHE SINGLE FOREIGN STAKEHOLDER OWNS AT LEAST 1% OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SHARES OR IN WHICH MORE THAN ONE STATE FOREIGN STAKEHOLDER OWNS AN AGGREGATE FIVE PERCENT. OBERNOLTE S. B. C. AND OTHER CORPORATE EXPERTS LOOK AT 1% OWNERSHIP AS ACTUALLY AN UPPER LIMIT BENCHMARK AT WHICH AN OWNER CAN INFLUENCE A LARGE CORPORATION. SHE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INCOME. BECAUSE OUR COURTS TREAT ELECTION CONTRIBUTION DIFFERENTLY BASED ON WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM IS IT BEING SPENT BY US CITIZEN OR PERMANENT RESIDENT OR THE BEING SPENT BY A FOREIGN ENTITY. IN CITIZENS UNITED THE SUPREME COURT DETERMINED THAT CORPORATE ELECTION SPENDING IS PROTECTED SPEECH BECAUSE U. S. CORPORATIONS ARE INCLUDING HERE ASSOCIATIONS OF CITIZENS. JUST TWO YEARS LATER THE SUPREME COURT JENNIFER NEED A DIFFERENT LOWER COURT DECISION. THE FCC WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY NOW JUSTICE CABIN ON- THAT HELD THE FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING ANY SPENDING ON ELECTION BY FOREIGN ENTITIES BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC SELF GOVERNANCE IMPORTANT. THAT THE MONEY IF YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS BUT A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT CENTER THE KING GOES OUT TO PRINT FIRED IN SUPPORT OF A CANDIDATE SOMETHING FAR BELOW THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- PROHIBITING WITH. FOREIGN INFLUENCE BUSINESS ENTITIES HERE AND CAN INCOME BY. A FOREIGN ENTITY IT'S NO LONGER AN ASSOCIATION SAID. FOUR INVESTMENT CAN BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR CORPORATE GROW GROW. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE A WAY IN WHICH FOREIGN RESOURCES AND INFLUENCE CAN AND ARE ELECTIONS THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO. MOVE THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I'VE BEEN GOVERNMENT I SEE YOU HERE TODAY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- PENDULUM BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- I WANT TO JUST ADDRESS A RIGHT AT THE TOP THE QUESTION I'VE GOTTEN THE MOST ABOUT THIS BILL WHICH IS HOW MANY BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED FROM CONTRIBUTING TO CAMPAIGNS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE MORE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO A FULL ASSESSMENT ON A MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND PLUS MEMBERS OR THE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES REGISTERED TO OPERATE IN THE STATE- I WOULD POINT OUT TO THE BILL'S SPONSORS ON STUDY. WHICH SHOWS THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PERMIT 98% OF S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS THAT'S 98% CHAU. THE BILL ALSO RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS I KNOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AND SPONSORS HAVE REFERRED TO A SIMILAR PROPOSAL IN SEATTLE- HOWEVER AT THE WASHINGTON STATE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S REQUEST- PERKINS CARILLO LONGTIME MOSTLY DEMOCRATIC LAW FIRM. DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL AND- THEY RESPONDED BY SAYING THAT QUOTE IT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY FACE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE IN SUCH A CHALLENGE WOULD HAVE A STRONG LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. OF THE COMMITTEE HEARS VERY. SMART ANALYSIS POINTS THAT QUOTE IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THIS BILL COULD RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF BUSINESS ENTITIES TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES IN ELECTIONS BASED ON RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER A COURT WOULD UPHOLD THIS BILL AGAINST A CHALLENGE THAT ITS PROVISIONS VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION- WE ALSO FIND THE BILL. A FAIRLY BROAD- AND- WHILE IT WOULD LIKELY APPLY TO- CONCORD AMERICAN BUSINESSES- A PARAPHRASE ONE SECTION FROM THE ANALYSIS HERE WHICH REALLY DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB THAT- EVEN WERE A BUSINESS THAT IS ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE U. S. HAS ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WE'RE ALL THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE- PROCESS. THE BILL MAKES POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THIS BUSINESS COULD STILL BE PROHIBITED BY THIS BILL FOR MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS OR EXPENDITURES. IN STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA- IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS MEANT TO HAVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY UNILATERALLY DISARM IN TERMS OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS- WE FIND SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS ALSO SOME OF PUNITIVE AND DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT IF THE BUSINESS MAKES A CONTRIBUTION. THE CEO HIMSELF OR HERSELF HAS TO SIGN A STATEMENT OF CERTIFICATION THE PROMISES THAT THE BUSINESS IS NOT HAVE FOREIGN INVESTORS WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF MAKING THAT CONTRIBUTION. AND THE FINAL SHOW REYES- IS WHAT I CALL THE PASS THROUGH PROVISION- AND I HAD TO READ THIS A FEW TIMES TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD IT BUT ESSENTIALLY- THE BILL PROHIBITS A PERSON WHO RECEIVED A CONTRIBUTION- FROM THEN USING THAT CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE A SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTION- TO A CANDIDATE BALLOT MEASURE XCERRA- OR TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANOTHER PERSON FOR THE PURPOSES OF MAKING A CONTRIBUTION- UNLESS THEY- ALSO RECEIVED FROM THE BILL. A COPY OF THE STATEMENT A CERTIFICATION THAT THE BUSINESS ENTITY IS NOT A FOREIGN INFLUENCE BUSINESS I HAVE TO BE HONEST WHEN I READ THE BILL I ASSUME THAT IT WAS BEING SPONSORED BY AN ASSOCIATION OF CAMPAIGN LAWYER SOME TREASURES BECAUSE THIS WOULD CREATE AN EXPLOSION IN TERMS OF THE JOBS THAT THESE INDUSTRIES- IN THOSE INDUSTRIES TO COMPLY WITH THIS- BUT IN SHORT. ONE LEGISLATOR RECEIVED A CONTRIBUTION FROM ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES YOU WOULD ALSO HAVE TO GO- TO THE HOT ORIGINAL BUSINESS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO YOUR COLLEAGUE AND ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE STATEMENT OF CERTIFICATION- ROM THE CEO.

IS QUICKER. THANK YOU MISTER OPERATOR WE WILL NOW TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS FOR THE AUTHOR. SEEING NONE MISTER LEE YOU MAY NOW CLOSE. WELL I WOULD FOR THE FIRST THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND LETTING US HAVE A GREAT PROVIDES HEARING TODAY ABOUT IT I JUST WANNA DRESS SOME OF THE POINTS BROUGHT UP IN OUR CONVERSATION TODAY AND ALSO THANKED THE OPPOSITION COMING FORWARD WITH THOSE ATTRACTIVE FIT AB FEEDBACK IN PRISM BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THE SEATTLE CASES THAT SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN THERE HAS BEEN NO CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGER HAS BEEN A COURT CHALLENGE. AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT SEATTLE IS HOME TO AMAZON THE LARGEST CORPORATION BASED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY HAVE NOT DONE IT AND THAT IS BECAUSE AS OUR- THIS IS TESTIFIED. IT WOULD PULLED UP AND GOT SCORE. HOWEVER WE NEVER HAD THE TESTS TO DO SO. BUT I DON'T THINK IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF GIVEN THAT THAT'S THE REALITY. HAVING GONE THROUGH TWO ELECTION CYCLES NOW. WELL THEY HAVE NOT HAD IT BEEN CHALLENGE AT ALL. AND ALSO WHAT WHY THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT TO AND SOMETHING TO STRESS ABOUT HIS. YEAH THIS IS DIRECT MONEY FROM THEIR SEATS FROM THE FOR INVESTORS GOING TO CORPORATE TREASURIES. THEN GOING INTO OUR ELECTIONS. THAT IS A HUGE CIRCUMVENTION. OF FEDERAL LAW. GLARING LOOPHOLE IN CITIZENS UNITED. ESSES UNITED HAD STRESSED THAT CORPORATIONS COULD SPEND BECAUSE UNLIMITED SPENDING. BECAUSE THEY WERE ASSOCIATIONS OF CITIZENS WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE ASSOCIATION HAS A SIGNIFICANT. A CONTROLLING INTEREST OR SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER WHO IS NOT A CITIZEN. AND THAT IS THE CASE. HERE ONE OF. THE TOP TWENTY ONE TO WELL ALL SORTS IMMIGRANTS AND FOR CAPITAL BUT WE MUST MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND TO CLOSE ON A QUOTE FORMER CEO OF US SPACE EXXON MOBIL IN THIS IN THIS INFAMOUS QUOTE. I'M NOT A US COMPANY I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE US IT'S TIME TO REIN IN FOREIGN INFLUENCE. AND PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SELF GOVERNANCE SO I WOULD LIKE TO. RESPECT NATURE I BET. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT WASN'T HERE FOR THE- MOMENT I. JUST HAVE A VERY QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU MADE A COMMENT AND I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH IT YOU SAID THAT- FOREIGN OWNERSHIP WENT FROM 9% TO EITHER TWO. 221940% FOUR ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BASICALLY WE'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF PASSION SUPPORTERS TODAY. ON THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO TOOK THEIR TIME TO TESTIFY. I THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS MADE SOME POINTS THAT ARE WORTH CONSIDERING. I WAS CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH- THERE IS A LOT TO UNPACK IN THIS BILL I KNOW SOMEWHERE EFFORT WAS TRIED. A LAST YEAR AND I SEE THAT THOSE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN LARGELY ADDRESSED- IN A MORE THOUGHTFUL WAY THIS YEAR. AND WITH THAT I AM RECOMMENDING. THIS COMMITTEE MOVE THIS BILL ON TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND SO WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY CAN WE CALL THE ROLL. I'LL IS THERE A MOTION. MISTER BENNETT SECOND I MISSED LOW. BUT NO ONE CALLED. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BRIAN BRIAN I SEYARTO BENNETT BENNETT I LOW WELL I MAYES LEE HI LEE I BLANCA RUBIO. BLANCA RUBIO IS NOT VOTING. THANK YOU LOSE OUT. MR LEVINE. IT HAPPENED BELATED GOOD SIR YOU. THIS IF YOU WANT AS THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR IS A GREAT PERSON YESTERDAY AND I WAS PLEASED TO CELEBRATE IT WITH YOU GUYS DURING THE DAY AND WITH MY FAMILY LAST NIGHT- IF I MAY AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE EXPENSE DISCLOSURE SO ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY BY APPLYING EXISTING LOBBYIST REGISTRATION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE LOBBYING FIRM SEEKING TO INFLUENCE INSURANCE MERGER DECISIONS THIS BILL REMEDIES AN ONGOING PROBLEM RECENTLY REPORTED IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE WORK CONSULTANTS WERE TO BE PAID A TWO MILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY FEE TO INFLUENCE THE APPROVAL OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY ACQUISITION. WHILE THE V. EIGHTEEN PUBLIC DISCLOSURE LAWS FOR LOBBYING ACTIVITY BECAUSE INSURANCE IS SUCH AN ESSENTIAL PRODUCT MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE UNIQUELY IMPORTANT TO CONSUMERS CHANGES IN CONTROL OF INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN HAVE DRAMATIC IMPLICATIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS UNDERSCORING THE DRAMATIC IMPACT THAT SUCH MERGERS CAN HAVE ON CONSUMERS AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN UNBIASED DETERMINATION OF THE MERITS OF SUCH ACTIONS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A BILL WAS ENACTED TO REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE TO MAYOR REQUIREMENTS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES REGULATED. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WOULD SIMPLY MAKE EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THOSE DECISIONS SUBJECT TO EXISTING LOBBYING REQUIREMENTS THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE LANDMARK LAW HELPS DELIVER GREATER GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY BY INSTITUTINGCERTAIN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE AND REGULATIONS ON WHAT LOBBYISTS DO ACT HAS TIGHT REGULATIONS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND LOBBYING RESTRICTIONS MANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS ONLY APPLY TO LOBBYING ON LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY DID NOT CAPTURE BROAD SWATHS OF ACTIVITY THAT LOBBYISTS AND- CONSULTANTS MAY ENGAGE. IN TO INFLUENCE POLICY IN WAYS THAT WILL AFFECT THEIR CLIENTS AND CALIFORNIANS IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL CLOSE A DISTURBING LOOPHOLE IN OUR POLITICAL PRACTICES LAWS THAT ALLOW A PERSON TO CIRCUMVENT. LOBBYING RULES AND PROHIBITIONS WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IS JERRY FLANAGAN CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL FOR CONSUMER WATCHDOG IS FLANAGAN TO SEE THANK YOU AT GERMAN BRIAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE COULD SEE ALL. THE PUBLIC REFORM ACT AS YOU KNOW WAS ADOPTED IN THE WAKE OF WATERGATE TO RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE BY REQUIRING PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. OF LOBBYING ACTIVITY IN MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC BUSINESSES CONTEST CONDUCTED. FOR ALL TO SEE CIRCLING A B. ARTICLE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE- HAVE WRECKED THE REFERENCE PERFECTLY CAPTURES THE ISSUE OF SO CALLED CONSULTANTS WHO ARE LOBBYIST FOR OTHER PURPOSES. INFLUENCING ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS. WHILE AVOIDING THE PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT THERE ARE TWO FORMER LAWMAKERS WERE HIRED BY WORKERS COMP INSURER TO INFLUENCE THE DECISION OF THE INSURANCE COME. OUT REGARDING IT IN A MERGER AT STAKE WERE POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN- OVER CHARGES FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS THE CONSULTANTS WERE TO BE PAID A TWO MILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY FEE CONTRACT FOR THAT LOBBYING ACTIVITY. AND THIS IS A COMPANY BY CLOAKED CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONCEAL THEIR TRUE SOURCE THESE EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE HAVE ALL THE HALLMARKS OF LOBBYING. AND CONSUMERS DESERVE THE TRUTH PARENTS AB SEVENTY EIGHTY THREE WOULD PROVIDE AB SEVENTY THREE SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE PART ME DOES NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL IT DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS BUT MERELY APPLIES EXISTING DISK. IT'S AB SEVENTY EIGHT THE MEASURE APPROACH. STATE LAW ALL DEFINE A LOT- AS ANYONE BEING PAID TO INFLUENCE A DECISION REGARDING ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION. HOWEVER THAT AS THE COMEDIAN ALICE NOTES. A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ADVICE OPINIONS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THAT'S RIGHT- NARROWLY INTERPRETED ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS TO EXCLUDE EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE AGENCIES DECISIONS- AND THAT'S BEEN INTERPRETED OPPOSED THAT DECISION TO APPLY TO MERGERS ACQUISITIONS. A LOT CAN BE SAID ABOUT THAT BUT NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WAS A LONG TIME AGO THINGS HAVE CHANGED. AB SNOT SANTINI THREE IMPORTANT ALSO FALLS THIS COMMITTEES PRIOR INCREMENTAL AND TARGETED CHANGE TO THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE AMENDED THE DEFINITION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHICH IS HAPPENING HERE- TO INCLUDE LOBBYING. EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS BY CALPERS WHEN INVESTING RETIREMENT FUNDS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OBVIOUSLY DOES REPORT DECISIONS AS WELL. I WANT TO GO TO THE COMEDIAN. I REALLY FOCUSES ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PAS I LEGISLATIVE AND CLAWS IDEATIONAL DECISIONS WAS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT THAT ANYONE HAVE QUESTIONS. BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST ALL THOSE TECHNICAL TERMS REALLY THE ISSUE HERE IS THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY. THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS PRECISELY LOBBYING AND IT'S PRECISELY THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT WANTED APPLIED PUBLIC DISCLOSURES TO. ALSO THE POLITICALREFORM ACTINIUM TO FIND QUALIFIED LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDING THAT DEFINITION. WAS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TEN IN ORDER TO EXPAND LOBBYING TO INCLUDE EFFORTS. AND FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WAS NEVER INTENDED TO EXCLUDE LOBBYING FROM THE DEFINITION WAR TO LIMIT PUBLIC DISCLOSURES. THERE IS NO OPPOSITION ON RECORD ON THIS BILL- THIS COMMITTEE WE- URGED VOTE YES AND SEND IT TO THE BALLOT SO THAT VOTERS CAN. VOICE THEIR OPINION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO EXPAND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY APPLYING EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO THESE TYPES OF MURDERS- IN MY- PREVIOUS LIFE I ALSO WORK ON HEALTHCARE ISSUES I MOSTLY DO LITIGATION ONGOOD GOVERNMENT ISSUES NOW BUT- SAT THROUGH A LOT OF HEARINGS ON INSURANCE COMPANY MERGERS IN KENTUCKY ABOUT. THAT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A DENIAL THAT GAMBLING IS TAKING PLACE AT RICK'S CAFE AND I'VE I WAS ELECTED A DECADE AGO TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I JUST FELT EXTRAORDINARILY NAIVE TO KNOW. THAT LOBBYISTS ARE ABLE TO MAKE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PAYDAYS ON DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A ONE SMALL BILL TO GET AT THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND RESPECT LAST FOR ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS LEVINE- GIVEN THE BROAD. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF INSURANCE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS- A SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY. AND THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS I ALSO APPRECIATE OFFERS EFFORTS TO NARROW THIS BILL IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS OF PRIOR VERSIONS WITH MOTION BY MISTER LEE IN THE SECOND BY MISTER BENNETT. MADISON WE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BRIAN. BRIAN I SEYARTO. BENNETT I LOW NO I MAYES E. LEAI BLANCA RUBIO ONE CAN RUBIO I. THE BILLS OUT I THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES- AND GIVEN THE QUICK SUPPORT I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT- THE GOOD START BY THING THE COMMITTEES CONSOLE MARKET COMMITTEE SHORT IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED I LIKE TO START BY THING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HER THOROUGH ANALYSIS IN THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT ON THE TOP OF PAGE NINE REGARDING THE CONSOLIDATION OF ELECTIONS I'M HAPPY THAT. I'M IN. SEVEN MONTHS AGO CALIFORNIA VOTERS GOING TO THE POLLS CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO RECALL GOVERNOR NEWSOM- THE GOVERNOR SOUNDLY DEFEATED THE RECALL AND THAT BEGIN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PROCESS ESTABLISHED BY VOTERS OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. THE COMMITTEE WHEN THE HEARINGS- RECORD HE WENT INTO HEARING RECALL REFORM HEARINGS RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE RECALL PROCESS AND THE NEED TO RETAIN THE SIMPLE. HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE BUT WE ALSO HEARD OF THE NEED FOR SOME PROCEDURAL STATUTORY REFORMS ACCORDINGLY AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD DO IT A NUMBER OF THINGS IT WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER RECALL PROPONENTS NECESSARY TO INITIATE THE RECALL PROCESS. IT WOULD EXTEND THE STANDARDS FOR ACCURACY AND REVIEW OF CANDIDATES STATEMENTS TO THE STATEMENT OF REASONS BY RECALL PROPONENTS AND THE ANSWER FROM THE ELECTED OFFICIAL TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT INACCURATE OR FALSE STATEMENTS BY EITHER THE RECALL PROPONENTS OR- IN A BY THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. WOULD PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE RECALL PETITION SIGNERS WITH GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN SCHOOL DISTRICT RELATED RECALLS BY REQUIRING THE PETITIONS LISTS THE ESTIMATED COST TO THE DISTRICT. WILL PROVIDE GREATER EFFICIENCY IN THE TIMING OF ELECTIONS AND MINIMIZE LOCAL AGENCY ELECTION COSTS BY ALLOWING MORE TIME TO CONSOLIDATE A RECALL A STATE OR LOCAL. BRING WITHIN ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. BECAUSE THE RECALL PROCESS IS SO IMPORTANT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT INTO THIS ISSUE LIGHTLY. I DON'T WAITED ISSUE. AND WOULD APPRECIATE FEEDBACK IF FOLKS HAVE CONCERNS OR THINK THEIR POTENTIAL PIECES MISSING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TODAY ARE CALL CARLOS MACHADO. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR OPEN SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION. AND MAKE A TOOL THE BOARD MEMBER FOR THE LOSS ALAMEDA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HOME OF A PERSON OKAY- GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BRIAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CARLOS MACHADO AND THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. OUT WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THE AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR. THE BILL WOULD HELP INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION RECALL PETITION PROCESS- WHILE PROVIDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH CRITICALLY NEEDED FLEXIBILITY TO MINIMIZE ELECTION COSTS. MANY DISTRICTS HAVE REACHED OUT TO CSPA REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RECALL ELECTIONS ARE HAVING ON THEIR STUDENTS. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR ELECTION COSTS RANGE FROM THE HIGH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. PER SMALLER DISTRICTS THESE COSTS CAN WREAK HAVOC. FORTUNATELY MANY VOTERS ARE NOT AWARE THAT THESE COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COULD REDUCE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR ENSURES THAT THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TO VOTERS BY THE PROPONENTS AND THE OFFICIAL SOUGHT TO BE RECALLED IS ACCURATE AND TRUE. THE BILL ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR TO VOTERS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTING ELECTION COSTS. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS THAT THESE ELECTIONS CAN HAVE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE BILL ALSO INSURERS BROADER VOTER SENTIMENT IS REFLECTED IN THE DECISION TO INITIATE A RECALL. ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES ON THE NOTICE OF INTENTION WILL HELP CURB ITS MISUSE WHEN ONLY AS FEW AS TEN SIGNATURES ARE CURRENTLY NEEDED TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL. TO HELP DISTRICTS MINIMIZE ELECTION COSTS THE BILL EXPANDS THE PERIOD DURING WHICH A SPECIAL ELECTION MAY BE CONSOLIDATED WITH A LOCAL OR STATE ELECTION. THIS CHANGE WILL HELP DISTRICTS SAVE AS MUCH AS HALF OR MORE ON ELECTION RELATED EXPENSES. MOREOVER BY COMBINING THE SPECIAL ELECTION WITH OTHER ELECTIONS AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR. FOR HOPING FOR THE PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT THE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES OKAY I'M GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BRIAN AN HONOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY SAYING AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND A CITIZEN THAT I DO SUPPORT A RECALL PROCESS IT'S PART OF OUR DEMOCRACY BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PROCESS CANNOT BE ADJUSTED- I WOULD MY NAME IS MAY COULD TOTALLY AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE LOS ALAMEDA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH IS LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN SIXTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE LOS AMIGOS. IN TWO THOUSAND I AM NOW SERVING MY TWENTY SECOND YEAR AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND I HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO THIS POSITION SIX TIMES AND EARLIER THIS YEAR I DID RECEIVE A NOTICE OF INTENT TO ALL THE LONG WITH TWO OTHER BOARD MEMBERS IT ONLY TOOK TEN TO SIGN THE PETITION TO INITIATE THIS PROCESS IN MY SITUATION THE RECALL GROUP WAS NOT VERY ORGANIZED AND THEY COULD NEVER COMPLETE THEIR- SIGNATURE GATHERING PETITION CORRECT THEY SELL MY RECALL JUST KIND OF WENT AWAY I GUESS I WAS LUCKY. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER RECALL IN ORANGE COUNTY TO DATE NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT THIS IS A THREAT THAT EVERY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER IN THE STATE IS AWARE OF MANY BOARD MEMBERS ARE WONDERING WHY THEY ARE WORKING SO HARD SO THAT ALL CHILDREN CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE ONLY TO BE FACED WITH THE THREAT OF RECALL BECAUSE SOMEONE DOES NOT LIKE A DECISION THEY HAVE MADE THIS IS LEADING TO A LOSS OF EXPERIENCE SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS WILL IMPACT THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR CHARGE IS TO EIGHT. GENERATION OF POIGNANT. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS AND HELP TO MAKE RECALLS BETTER WAY TO REFLECT BETTER REFLECTION WITH A MUCH LARGER VOTER. TURNOUT THE REASONABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BILL TO THE MINIMUM SIGNATURES REQUIRED FOR A NOTICE OF INTENTION WILL HELP YOU. WHAT WOULD HELP LIMIT IT USED FOR THE PURPOSE AND- THEN WHAT IS INTENDED. THE PUBLIC REVIEW AND RIP PROCESS OF THE BILL WILL ENSURE VOTERS ARE PROVIDED WITH ACCURATE AND TRUTHFUL INFORMATION IN THE PROPONENT STATEMENT. AND THE OFFICE HOLDER WE CURRENTLY HAVE A BOARD MEMBER WHO IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RECALLED. AND IS BEING AND THE REASONS FOR HIS RECALLS THAT HE WAS NOT LEGALLY ELECTED. AND THAT HE STARTED THE MASK MANDATE HE DID NOT DO THE MASS MANDATE ANOTHER PERSON TO IT AND HE WAS ALMOST RECALL BUT IN FACT I CAN GO. AND HE WAS LEGALLY- ELECTED BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE FILED PAPERS AND ACCORDING TO ELECTION LAWS IF YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON WHO FILES FOR A POSITION. YOU GET IT BUT HE IS FACING RECALL ON TWO VERY ARONIE US- ISSUES. THIS BILL ALSO ENABLE SCHOOL DISTRICT REDUCE THE RECALL COSTS BY CONSENT CONSOLIDATING THE ELECTIONWITH OUR LOCAL AND STATE ELECTIONS. THIS HELPS REDUCE THE TOTAL ELECTION EXPENSES FOR THE SCOTT FOR ALL THE SCHOOLS AND AS PART OF THIS BILL. IN THIS ALSO ALLOWS VOTERS. RESPECT WE GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP. OKAY- I JUST OKAY- I JUST I HAD ABLE TO OUR SCHOOL THIS AND ARCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MONEY. I DO ONE PRIMARY ENOUGH. OR AND HE THE ARE YOU HERE TODAY A SECOND. BONTA RAISES ONE SURE TWO MINUTES I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST THE THIS COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFUL BUT YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL BOARDS IN THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE NATION HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES HAVE FOR IT FACING STRONG OPPOSITION FROM PARENTS SO WHEN YOU HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENTAL INTEREST AND THE SCHOOL BOARDS THE ONLY. MECHANISM THE PARENTS HAVE TO HOLD THE SCHOOL BOARDS ACCOUNTABLE IS TO FIRE THEM IF THEY DON'T DO THEIR JOB IF THEY DON'T REPRESENT THEIR TRUE INTERESTS AND THAT'S THE RECALL PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR I DO AGREE WITH ONE ASPECT OF THE BILL. AND THAT'S FOR YOUR IT AND FACTUAL MASON ON BOTH OF THE PARTIES BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR IN FACT A MADE SOME YOU KNOW SOME MIS INFORMATION AND ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE NOT TRUE ON HIS STATEMENT AND I YOU KNOW. I DO AGREE WITH THAT THERE COMPONENTS TO THIS THAT IT'S A LENGTHY BILL I CAN'T GO INTO IT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME BUT- IT DOES NEED TO BE AMENDED HEAVILY. THANK YOU FOR TAP THANK.

VARNISHED MEMBERS NO ONE START BUY EXTRA THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- APPRECIATE THE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ABM TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO SO VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD- MAJOR IT'S SIMP SIMPLY SEEKS TO SIMPLIFY THE LOCAL RECALL PROCESS- COMMITTEE SPENT A LOT OF TIME REVIEWING THE RECALL PROCESS I WORKED WITH THE FORMER CHAIR- I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM ABOUT THIS- AND IT'S BEEN A CONCERN FOR QUITE SOME TIME BECAUSE OF SOME THINGS CAN BE DONE- WITHOUT- A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE AND AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION- WILL WE HAVE TO SORT OF COLLECTIVELY DECIDED ON A STRATEGY OF PUTTING FORWARD A- NUMBER OF BILLS TO MAKE THIS CHANGE- AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO. HAS THE FOLKS THE VOTERS FOCUS ON THE RECALL ONLY AND NOT DEALING WITH THE CONFUSION OF WHO WERE ALL THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT- I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT AS MORE MORE WEALTH GETS CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF THE SMALLER NUMBER OF PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE WEAPONIZING THE RECALL CAMPAIGN AND PEOPLE ARE USING THE RECALL CAMPAIGN TO GET THEMSELVES ELECTED- AND- WE HAVE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE- IN THE CITY OF OXNARD LARGEST CITY AND COUNTY OF INTER A- A CHARACTER COULD NOT WIN IN THE REGULAR ELECTION IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHES A RECALL AGAINST ALL FOUR PEOPLE- ON THE CITY COUNCIL- AND- NONE OF THOSE ARE SUCCESSFUL- BUT CLEARLY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS TRYING TO SEE IF THEY COULD PULL OFF BY RECALL WHAT THEY COULDN'T PULL. HI IN THE GENERAL ELECTION SO THIS BILL I THINK IT'S JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT YOU'VE YOUR FOCUS ON THE RECALL AND IF THE PERSON DOES GET RECALLED YOU TREAT IT JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS AND CAN CREATE WHATEVER PROCEDURES THEY WANT TO TRY TO FILL THAT IN BUT IT DOESN'T ALLOW SOMEBODY TO AUTOMATICALLY USE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LITTLE OUT OF BREATH I THINK WE'RE ALL PLAYING MUSICAL CHAIRS TODAY RUNNING BACK AND FORTH. FIRST OF ALL I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE STAFF- BOTH HERE AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL AND M. AND MY STAFF FOR WORKING SO- WELL TOGETHER. WITH EVERYONE IN TRYING TO BRING THIS BILL FORWARD- TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT- TO THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT- MOTION THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO EXTEND THE MISSION OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MONEY INFLUENCES CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS PASSED SHORTLY AFTER THE WATERGATE SCANDAL WHEN GOVERNMENT SKEPTICISM WAS HIGH ACROSS THIS NATION. THE ACT WAS DESIGNED TO PUT AN END TO THE CORRUPTION BY REQUIRING DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE ROLE OF MONEY IN POLITICS. TO THIS DAY THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IS HELD IN HIGH REGARD. BECAUSE IT OFFERS MORE TRANSPARENCY IN OUR GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY DEPENDING UPON THE TYPE OF CANDIDATE OR ELECTED OFFICIAL RUNNING. LOCATING CAMPAIGN STATEMENTS CAN BE EASIER SAID THAN DONE THOUGH CANDIDATES WHETHER THEY ARE REPRESENTATIVES OF CITIES COUNTIES OR STATE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS OF FILING AND FILING LOCATIONS WHICH CAN MAKE FINDING INFORMATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT AIMS TO EXTEND THIS MISSION OF POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF THE PREFER POLITICAL REFORM ACT BY CREATING A ONE PUBLIC LOCATION ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE STATE'S WEBSITE CAL EXCESS. IN WHICH CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS SHOWING UP FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE CAN BE FOUND REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OR CANDIDATE THE SECRETARY THE STATE IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO UPDATE THE CALYX AND SYSTEM AS WE'RE ALL AWARE IN IN. HOPEFUL THAT IT'LL GET DONE IN A IN A TIMELY WAY. I WILL BE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS DRAFTED BY THE COMMITTEE THAT REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY THE FOLLOWING JANUARY REGARDING THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT LOCAL CAMPAIGN DISCLOSURE REPORTS IN THE CALYX AS A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM. IS FURTHER CLARIFIED THAT THE REPORT WILL BE DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY FINALLY THE GOAL OF THIS BILL WILL BE OPERATIVE A YEAR AFTER THE SECRETARY STATE CERTIFIES THE CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM. THAT THE SYSTEM CAN BE ACCOMMODATED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I BIGELOW FOR ALSO A PRESENTING AND ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME SEE NON OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. I WANT TO MAKE PLEASE PRESS ONE. NINE ZERO- WE HAVE NO RESPONSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATOR NOW TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEARING THE COMMITTEE ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SINAN OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT. PROPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THE START. ALTHOUGH NOT ALIGNMENT NUMBER FORTY LINE FORTY ONE PLEASE. HELLO THERE MEMBERS. YES OUR TAXES ARE WANTING TO SPEAK IN- SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE MONEY MR LATCHAM AND- FOR DAVID BRADLEY RUNNING U. S. SENATE THANK YOU. AND AGAIN MR ADDITIONAL RESPONDENTS COMPUTE THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- BUT WILL HAVE GO TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SUMMARILY APPRECIATE THIS BILL APPRECIATE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY AND I THINK THE DIRECTION OF THE BILLS REALLY GOOD BUT IS THE ONUS ON FILING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON THE CANDIDATE EVEN AFTER THESE. AMENDMENTS THAT DON IS ON THE- CANDIDATE IS TO MAKE THE REPORTING- THE PURVIEW. AT THAT SECRETARY THE STATE'S AT THAT TIME. SO THEY WOULD STILL BE FIGHTING THE BUT FACES I JUST WONDERING SINCE OBVIOUSLY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE TO RECEIVE THE SAME PAPERWORK. WHY WAS IT TENSION TO PUT ON THE CANDIDATE NOT SAY THE LOCAL FILING JURISDICTION COULD THEY SAID IT'S A GREAT STATE. THE OWNERS AT THE END OF THIS WHEN THIS BILL IS AN- ENFORCED WE'LL JUST GO TO THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE. THEY WON'T HAVE TO DO DUPLICATE WORK. RIGHT SO I WAS WONDERING WHY NOT HAVE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT THE COUNTY CLERK FILE IT TO SECURE THE INSTEAD OF THE- CANDIDATE. BECAUSE CANDIDATES RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THE RECORDING I'M NOT NOT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY SPEAKING OKAY. OUR GOAL THANK YOU FOR ANSWER QUESTION I JUST THINK. IT JUST MAKES A LOT SENSE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THOSE TINY RACES WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ORIGINALLY. THAT NOT EVERYONE IS A STEEP IN CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW BUT THEY SHOULD STILL HAVE. CAN BE DISCLOSURES MADE AVAILABLE WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO- NOT FOUND HIS DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO CELLS THAT'S WHILE IT'S I'M MORE PRONE AND HAVING TO LOCAL JURISDICTION FILE IF POSSIBLE. I'M SO HAPPY IT'S PORTABLE TO MS PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PREDICT THOSE COMMENTS ASSEMBLY RUBEN YEAH. I HAVE SOME DIRECT EXPERIENCES COUNTY SUPERVISOR WITH THIS ISSUE- AND AS A SUGGESTION OF ACT. OFFER AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD ASSUMING IT. DOES MOVE FORWARD- IS WE ENDED UP MAKING IT A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CANDIDATE AND THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CLERKS HE HAD A DOUBLE RESPONSIBILITY THERE- WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THE CLERKS WERE- BUT- YOU KNOW BOTH WERE. BURKE HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD DO IT- IN AND- IT FOR VARIETY OF REASONS I THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT. THE CLERK. IF THE CLERK HAS REACHED. MAKE EVERYTHING FILED THEM SHOWS UP. AND THEY- ALSO KNOW THE- CANDIDATE HAS A RESPONSE. IT'S A CANDIDATE FOR SOME THIS SURE THAT. BUT THE- PAPERWORK IS FILED. THEN THE CLERK SHOULD HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO SOMEHOW MAKE SURE THAT THAT GETS ON THE SUBJECT IT'S A JET SUGGESTION THOUGH- THAT OF. AFTER HAVING SOME INTERACTIONS ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE I'VE TRIED HAVE ELECTRONIC FILING- WEEK WE CAME UP WITH SO. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH AS IT MOVES FORWARD. WELL I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND ARE THERE WELL TAKEN AND I'LL I'LL DEFINITELY TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AS- YOU AND I BOTH HAD EXPERIENCE BEING COUNTY SUPERVISORS. YOU KNOW I SPENT TWELVE YEARS DOING IT AND IT IT'S IT. IT IS A CHALLENGING YOU'RE RIGHT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF IT BUT- IT HAS TO BE DONE AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE HONEST. THE REASON THAT AT ANY LENGTH FOR THIS ELECTRONIC FILING HAS SO MANY BENEFITS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC- THAT IT'S- SO MANY. THANK YOU MUCH FOR THAT SIX. WELCOME BACK MISTER CHAIR WE CROSSED PATHS.

FOR SO NEXT UP WE- A EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT. BY CHAIR MISTER BRIAN. WHEN YOU'RE READY. MISTER VICE CHAIR- AND COLLEAGUES THANK YOU WHEN THE CENTER BUREAU COUNTY WITH PART OF THE SENTENCE COUNTED CARCERI TO PEOPLE AS RESIDENTS AT THE PRISON WE THEY ARE INCARCERATED RATHER THAN AS PART OF THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES BECAUSE CENSUS DATA IS USED FOR DRAWING THE LINES POLITICAL BOUNDARIES THIS PRACTICE DISTORTS REPRESENTATION AT LOCAL AND STATE LEVELS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN LEGISLATOR PROVED AB FOR TWENTY BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIKE DAVIS WHICH SOUGHT TO END THIS PRACTICE WHICH IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS PRISON GERRYMANDERING. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA VOTERS CREATED A CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AND GAVE IT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REDISTRICTING OF CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATIVE AND BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DISTRICTS AB FOUR TWENTY REQUESTED THE COMMISSION TO TREAT INCARCERATED PEOPLE AS RESIDING IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN AT THE PRISONS WHERE THEY ARE INCARCERATED WHEN ADOPTING DISTRICT LINES. IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF STUDY AND DISCUSSION THE COMMISSION UNANIMOUS. TO COMPLY WITH THIS REQUEST. AS THE DIGITAL LINES. DID BY THE COMMISSION LAST DECEMBER MARKED THE FIRST TIME THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE CONGRESSIONAL AND BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DISTRICTS WERE NOT DISTORTED. DUE TO PRISON J. MAN ADDITIONALLY LAST SESSION LEGISLATOR PROVED TO BILLS TO ELIMINATE PRISON GERRYMANDERING AND LOCAL REDISTRICTING. SINCE COMPLETING ITS LINE DRAWING ACTIVITIES IN DECEMBER THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION HAS BEEN REFLECTING ON ITS WORK. OVER THE PAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AND WORKING TO IDENTIFY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT IT SUPPORTS OF THE BODY. ONE CHANGE AT THE COMMISSION VOTED TO SUPPORT IS CHANGING STATE LAW TO REQUIRE. THAT INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS BE DEEMED RESIDENTS OF THEIR LAST KNOWN PLACES OF RESIDENCE. FOR ALL FUTURE STATE REDISTRICTING PROCESSES. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT MAKES THAT CHANGE. IN FORTY EIGHT MAKES OTHER TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE ELECTIONS GO TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT LEGISLATOR NO LONGER HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADOPTING DISTRICT LINES FOR THE LEGISLATOR CONGRESS AND BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. ALTHOUGH THE CITIZENS REDUCTION COMMISSION IS NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THE EXACT LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL MY OFFICE IS WORKING INCREDIBLY CLOSELY WITH AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AT THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. A. B. EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. OF CALIFORNIA AND HAS NO OPPOSITION.

LAST KNOWN ADDRESS PRIOR TO INCARCERATION. EIGHTY EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN FED REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AGAINST REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AFTER EACH SPENT THAT ACCOUNT USING CARTS RATE PERCENT AT HIS OR HER LAST KNOWN DDRESS RATHER THAN THE PLACE OF INCARCERATION THE TWENTY TWENTY COMMISSION DID JUST THAT X. SHARE BRIAN NOTED THAT IT BELIEVES THAT MAKE SENSE OF IT BEING AUTOMATIC RATHER THAN A REQUEST FOR EACH FUTURE COMMISSION TO DECIDE EVERY TEN YEARS COUNTING EACH EQUESTRIAN BUT THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE DRESS MAKES FAR MORE SENSE AND THE PICK OF INCARCERATION IN THE LATTER OWN ONLY ARTIFICIALLY DRIVES UP NUMBERS IN THE COUNTY WITH THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. ADDITIONALLY INCARCERATED PERSON IN NOT INTENDED A MAN IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING RESIDENT STATUS THE LAST NINETY CAR STRAIGHT PERSON TO DRESS IS THE FAR FAIR DETERMINATION TO COUNTY CORK STRAIGHT PERSON RATHER THAN AT THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY I WOULD BE HAPPY.

OR THEY COUNTED AT HOME THE REGISTRATION AND THAT'S IT'S ACTUALLY UP TO THE COLLEGE STUDENTS- SO I IMAGINE WHERE THE REGISTERED AT YEAH WE'RE THERE TO WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO REGISTER AT AS THE DOMICILE WHETHER THEY'RE OUT OF STATE EVEN THEY'RE ALLOWED TO. CONTINUE TO VOTE I ELECTIONS- IN THEIR HOME DOMICILE. SO IF THEY WISH TO BE BECAUSE THEY THEY I UNDERSTAND THE CITY'S ISSUES WITH THIS IS. IT YOU KNOW. THEY WOULD LIKE EVERYBODY PAST AND PRESENT TO BE INCLUDED INTO THEIR ACCOUNTS BECAUSE THEN THEY GET THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED- BUT AND ALSO THE AREAS WHERE THE PRISONS ARE LOCATED THEY ALSO NEED THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE PEOPLE ARE IN. OUR ANY OF THE ANCILLARY SERVICES AND STUFF SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF MY QUANDARY ON THIS IS. IS YOU KNOW IF THE TRUE- IDEA OF THIS IS TO COUNT THE PERSON. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE HAVING THE IMPACT FOR THE TIME THAT THEY'RE HAVING THAT IMPACT. IT'S LIKE HOW DO YOU RECONCILE WHAT'S FAIR FOR. WHO IS NOW YOU'RE COUNTING SOMEBODY THAT YOU'RE REALLY NOT SERVING. WHERE IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OR- OFTEN ANOTHER AREA. CABINETS ARE MY CLOTHES YEAH.

FOLSOM PRISON- HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE NONE OF THEM FROM THE SURROUNDING AREA AND IRONICALLY ALL OF THEM FROM THE CRENSHAW DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT- THERE IS A MIS CALCULATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AS A RECOMMENDATION. THAT THEY COUNT PEOPLE IN THEIR LAST HOME ADDRESS AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IT WAS IMPORTANT THERE WERE NO CHALLENGES TO THE NEW MAPS THAT WERE DRAWN. I AND THEN THEY ARE THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF DOING THAT PERMANENTLY- IN ADDITION TO THIS LEGISLATOR MOVING PREVIOUS LEGISLATION BACK ON THE LEGISLATURE HAD THE POWER TO DRAW THESE LINES AND SO I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CAN COMMISSION CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND- IN THE BEST INTEREST OF- ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
