MISTER MEMBERS IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES OF HISTORIC PROPORTION DEVASTATING BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS MANY ANIMALS ARE LEFT BEHIND IN THE RUSH TO EVACUATE. THESE DISASTERS TRAGICALLY HIGHLIGHT THE SERIOUS NEED FOR PREPARING AND EXECUTING EVACUATION PLANS FOR ANIMALS SOME COUNTIES REQUIRE ANIMAL OWNERS WHO OWN OVER A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF DOGS OR CATS TO OBTAIN A KENNEL PERMIT. AB SIXTEEN FORTY IT WOULD ENSURE THESE COUNTIES REQUIRE THE PERMIT HONORED TO CREATE SUBMIT AN ANIMAL NATURAL DISASTER EVACUATION PLAN THIS BILL WOULD HELP SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY ANIMALS DURING WILDFIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS WHILE ALSO SAVING FIRST RESPONDERS TIME AND RESOURCES. WITH ME ON THE LINE I HAVE JUDY MAN COUP SO ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION ENGINE AND OUT FROM MICKELSON FOUND ANIMALS. OPERATOR DO WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING.

WHICH FIFTY ELATED I PAID IT PERMITS PETER THEM ALLOW THEM TO INSPECT THE PROPERTY AND THAT I HAD TO HAVE AN EVACUATION PLAN AT FIRST I DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN EVACUATION PLAN REALLY MEANT IT AND MY CIRCUMSTANCE. BUT IN TALKING TO THE ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS THAT THE CITY WHO ISSUED THE PERMIT I UNDERSTOOD THAT I NEEDED WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET MY ANIMALS OUT SAFELY AND QUICKLY IN CASE OF A NATURAL DISASTER. WHICH MEANT FOR ME HAVING THE PROPER NUMBER OF YOURS AND A VEHICLE LARGE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TRANSPORT THEM IT. UPON MY NEXT INSPECTION I SHOW THEM I HAD PUT ALL OF IT AND FIGHT.

AND GIVEN THAT WE KNOW WITH FOR THE NEXT EVACUATION ORDERS HAVE BEEN THAT ADVANCE PREPARATION TO INCLUDE EVACUATION PLANS FOR OUR FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS CRITICAL. AB SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT WILL REQUIRE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO OBTAIN EVACUATION PLANS WHEN ISSUING KNNEL PERMIT.

INCLUDING AN EVACUATION PLAN IN IT IN AN ALREADY EXISTING PERMITTING PROCESS OF THE POTENTIAL TO EXPONENTIALLY REDUCE THE BURDEN ON ANIMAL CONTROL AGENCIES FIRST RESPONDERS BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ANIMALS THAT SUFFER AND OFTEN DIE AS A RESULT.

A YEAR CURRY I CALDERON CALDERON AYE GRAY. WALDRON WALDRON I TOWARD. FIVE EYES ARE LOOKS LIKE CONSENT IS OUT FOR NEXT BELIEVE I SEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN. GEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MERKLEY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY VERY GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT BY AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN THE RURAL CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ACT. AND- I WANT TO SAY I VIEW THIS IS A BILL TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA FUNCTION AS AN ENTIRE STATE. BIKE KNOWLEDGE IN THE SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL COUNTIES HAVE EXPERIENCED WHICH INCLUDE DECLINING POPULATIONS. AND AND SO TO ME THIS IS ACTUALLY A FUNDING PROGRAM FOR A BILL TO SUPPORT PRIMARILY COUNTIES UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO THAT ARE THERE LOCAL OFFICIALS CONCEPTO GETS FOR THINGS ARE NEEDED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THE STATE WILL STEP UP TO HELP FUND THE ACT- SO I VIEW IT AS KIND OF TRYING TO FUNCTION AS ONE BIG STATE- BUT LET ME CONTINUE LET ME. PROCEED WITH MY STATEMENT HAVING SAID THAT. I DO KNOW THIS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE GREAT STATED. THE PEOPLE AGREE SENATE JEFFERSON DO USE THAT EXPRESSION- WHICH IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW WELL- RECENT DATA FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES DEMOGRAPHICS UNIT SHOWS THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ONLY EIGHT OUT OF OUR FIFTY COUNTIES EITHER HAD NO POPULATION GROWTH OR EXPERIENCE POPULATION LOSS WHETHER FROM LACK OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OR MOVES CAUSED BY WILD FLOWERS WHEN CITIES AND COUNTIES LOSE RESIDENTS AND THEIR TAX BASE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE AVAILABLE PAY FOR LOCAL UPKEEP SUFFERS. COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS FOR SERVER HIGHLIGHT LOCAL CULTURE AS WELL AS PROVIDE IN A NUMBER OF JUST SATURATED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING SHELTER IN PLACE ARE CONSISTENTLY UNDERFUNDED AND IN DISREPAIR. AW I REPRESENT RANCHO MURIETA WHICH IS ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF SECOND A COUNTY DOWN THE JACKSON HIGHWAY AND THE MOST LOGICAL SAY SPOT THE GOAL IS TO RUN UP THE HILL TO THE AMADOR COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS JUST BE ON PLYMOUTH ABOUT TWELVE MILES AWAY. LOCAL ROADS MAINTAINED BY COUNCILS HAVE YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH AFFECT POTENTIAL EVACUATION ROUTE FOR RESIDENTS. AS WELL AS CRITICAL ACCESS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. SMALL TOWNS AND UNINCORPORATED ERRORS HAVE NO FUNDING MECHANISM TO REPAIR OR BRING UP TO CODE HISTORICALLY STABLE BUILT SIGNIFICANT BUILDINGS FOR THE COMMUNITY- AND- ENJOY. HISTORIC RANGES OR OTHER SORTS OF FACILITIES THAT ARE A VITAL PART OF LOCAL HISTORY. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN THE RURAL CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE ACT APPROPRIATES ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS FOR GRANTS TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS. INDEPENDENT FIRE DISTRICT SO THERE I'M REALLY TALKING VOLUNTEER TYPE FIRE DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE LIMITED MEANS LIKE HAROLD CALIFORNIA OR WILL IN CALIFORNIA HELLO THERE AND SECOND COUNTY BUT THEY ILLUSTRATE THE IDEA. R. OR COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND FOR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. INCLUDING DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DISASTER RECOVERY HIGHWAY OR STREET REPAIR FOR EVACUATION ROUTES. THE FUNDS WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK THE SO CALLED HIGH BANK. SO IN THAT SENSE THIS IS NOT TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL IS TAKEN AND A WELL ESTABLISHED TRUCKS- IN FITTING THIS INTO THAT STRUCTURE. ON OFTENTIMES ARE IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE PROJECTS TO BRING FORMAL COVERS THE PHONE BUT TOO SMALL TO DRAW DOWN STATE FEDERAL MONIES. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN WILL HELP GET MONEY TO THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS- IN RURAL PARTS. OF CALIFORNIA. ON AND I DO UNDER. THAT JEFF NEAL ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNTIES PROBABLY JOIN US ON THE PHONE AS A WITNESS AND SUPPORT. STRUCTURE DEFERRED TO HIM NOW. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER OPERATOR TO HAVE- JR FROM THE LINE. YOUR LINE IS OPEN GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JEFF NEAL HERE. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES TO SUPPORT THE BILL. IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY- WE SUPPORT THE BILL UP FOR TWO. WHARTON REASONS FIRST OF ALL DESPITE THE DECADE LONG SURGEON STATE REVENUES MOST COUNTIES HAVE HAD LACKLUSTER GROWTH IN THEIR GENERAL PLANS IN MOST COUNTIES THAT GENERAL FUND REVENUES PER CAPITA ARE STILL BELOW THE LEVELS THEY WERE AT BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION TO RECESSION TO GO NOW BUT IN REAL DOLLARS THIS PROBLEM IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN SMALL COUNTIES. M. PARTLY BECAUSE THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE DOESN'T SCALE DOWN PROPORTIONATELY WITH POPULATION SIZE AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF WILDFIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS HAVE FALLEN DISPROPORTIONATELY ON SMALL COUNTIES AND WILL COMMUNITIES- IN ADDITION THIS YEAR WE THINK ANOTHER. GREAT REASON. FOR THIS BILL. INSTEAD THAT CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATION LIMIT- AND SO THIS IS A GREAT TIME THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR FOR THE STATE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL PROVIDE A LONG TERM BENEFIT TO THESE AREAS THAT. DO BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE. RISKING DISPROPORTIONATE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS- AND THAT IN MANY CASES. HAVE LACKLUSTER REVENUE GROWTH SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS NOTHING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLIES. OFFERING THE BILL AND- APPRECIATE YOUR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU DIFFERENT- WITH THAT IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM IN SUPPORT. SHE NONE IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE LIKE SPEAKING SUPPORT OPERATOR ANYONE ON THE LINE. OPEN THE PHONE BILLS OFFENSIVE HE LEADS BECAUSE SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINETEEN PRESS ONE ZERO PLEASE. I HAVE ONE FOR THE STATE AND I LIKE TO MAKE WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT MISTER CHAIR. MR WE HAVE NO RESPONSE IN Q. THANK YOU MUCH- ST BERKELEY JONATHAN. YEAH I WANT TO SAY THAT- AS ON THE ANNEX PROJECT WHICH I HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH- WHICH REFLECTS OUR- PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS USE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE THIS BILL PROPOSED TO SPEND MONEY AROUND THE STATE THE STATE'S STEPPING UP TO FUND THIS I FAVOR THOSE SORTS OF PROVISIONS I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR ON HOW TO SEE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WORKS. BUT I DO SUPPORT OF THE INCLUSION OF LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION- BY OUR LABOR PARTNERS I'VE INTEND TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. ON HOW YOU. DROPPED THAT LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL. BUT TO CLARIFY THAT DARES- AS YOU'VE PROJECT PROCEED FOR PROJECTS WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE FUNDED BUT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PROVISION AND OF COURSE I KNOW THAT MEANS THAT THOSE DOLLARS WILL GET SPIN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT THEY'RE SPUR. LOCAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SO I THINK IT'S ALL A BIG PART OF THE STATE'S SUPPORT IN THE ENTIRETY OF OUR STATE IS TO HELP. KEEP ECONOMY IS HUMMING. AND THIS TAKES DOLLAR CONSUMERS WITH DOLLARS IN HER POCKET. SO I THINK- IF THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THOSE SORTS OF FUNDS THEY WILL STILL GET A LOCAL COLLEGE THAT'S A GOOD. VISION AND THAT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION TODAY AND I'M ACTUALLY QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. OKAY THANK YOU- WITHOUT US OR ANYONE IN THE ROOM FOR OPPOSITION. ASSEMBLY WE HAVE SOMEBODY COME FOR PROPOSITION. FOUR HUNDRED. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE WEST WITH THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OR AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WITH THE MEMBER AND HIS STAFF AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE AND SKILLED IN TRAIN WHICH ARE GRADUATES OF STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OF THE MEMBER STAFF HAS BEEN RECEPTIVE- TO OUR DIALOGUE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CHANGE IN OUR POSITION TO SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN PERSON HERE FOR OPPOSITION. WHAT THAT WILL GO OVER TO THE PHONES. OPERATORS ARE ANYONE ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION- IN OPPOSITION FOR TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN PRESS ONE ZERO PLANS. MISTER TURNER RESPONDENTS ARE QUEUING UP. OKAY WITHOUT WILL BRING BACK TO MEMBERS AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A MOTION AND A SECOND RIGHT. AND THE RECEIVER COVER I WAS EMOTIONAL. OR EDLER CURRY WITH THE MOTION HELLO THIS. ANY QUESTIONS COMES BY. BY YOUR TWO SEVEN A- THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND- YOU KNOW IT KIND OF APPROACHES THIS. WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA YEAH SOMETIMES WE TRY TO CREATE THE SOLUTIONS FOR EVERYBODY TO TRY TO APPLY TO THE DISTRICT WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOW THOSE DISTRICTS. TO FIND AND IDENTIFY THEIR OWN ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS TO THOSE ISSUES. AND THEN USUALLY THERE'S NO FUNDING MECHANISM FOR IT SO THIS ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY WHERE THEY CAN GET THE FUNDING AND MAKE A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR THEM- WHICH IS. A I THINK IT'S A COMMENDABLE APPROACH. TO TRYING TO ACTUALLY HELP AND MAKE A DENT IN THESE- THESE FACILITIES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY FAIR GROUNDS AND THINGS. THEY ARE THE SAFE REFUGE AREAS THEY ARE THE BASE CAMP AREAS FOR INCIDENT COMMAND CENTERS FOR. ALL THESE AND IF THEY ARE NOT WELL MAINTAINED AND-THERE IS ANOTHER BUILDING HERE THAT HELP WITH BROADBAND IN THOSE AREAS- THEN WE HAVE SHORTAGES IN IN THOSE TYPE OF FACILITIES THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN TIMES OF. OF CRISIS AND DEBT SO- NEEDED VERY COMMENDABLE- APPROACH TO- THE THIS IN THIS ISSUE AND I- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. THANK YOU SOME MEMBERS THANK YOU ANY ONE ELSE QUESTIONS CARRILLO. SO THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS A FUNCTION OF STATE GOVERNMENT. TO NOT ALWAYS SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. BUT TO FIND A WAY TO RELEASE ENERGY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE ACTUALLY WE ARE ABLE TO RELEASE ENERGY AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT MORE PEOPLE PUT THEIR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL MORE THINGS WILL GET DONE. AND WILL BE VALUED BECAUSE IT'S WHAT THEY PRIORITIZED. SO I THINK FOR HIGHLIGHTED THAT I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS A. I TO ME THAT JUST MEANS. AREN'T THESE THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE FORTUNATE THEY'RE PART OF A BIG PROSPER STATE AND IT'S JUST RIGHT FOR THE- FOR THE MORE- THE AREAS WITH MORE RESOURCES TO KIND OF FUNCTIONS ONE STATE. SO I JUST THINK THIS IS SORT OF AN EASY PURPOSE UNUM RELEASE OF ENERGY BILL AND I REQUEST TRAVEL BILL AS WELL IT'S A THREAT TO THE HOME OR PROTECT OUR FOLKS WITH THAT WAS MOTION SECOND THE MOTION TO PASS. TO THE COMMITTEE ON JOBS ECONOMIC A NUMBER DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMY SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. RODRIGUEZ HI RODRIGUEZ AYE SECTOR AYE SECTOR AYE AGIR CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I CALDERON. CALDERON I GRADE.

ALL RIGHT NEXT UP WE HAVE A BEAST TWENTY ONE MISTER CHAIR WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR SIR YOUR TOTAL CALIFORNIA IS A DISASTER PRONE STATE. AND ENHANCING THE STATE'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO TWO MAJOR DISASTERS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE PRINT PARTY FOR ME. IT IS NO SECRET THAT WORKS EXPECT TO HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR EARTHQUAKE ON THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. NUMBER NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAN OUR THREE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE AND THE DEATHS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. IF WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED DURING THE HEIGHT OF OUR PANDEMIC OUR MUTUAL AID TO AN EMS SYSTEMS. BUT I'VE BEEN OVERWHELMED. THIS BILL HAS THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS. A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SEISMIC RETROFIT PROGRAM TO PROTECT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN THEIR HOMES. A FIFTY MILLION EMS MUTUAL AID GRANT PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE OUR MERCH MEDICAL SEARCH CAPABILITIES. AT A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LOCAL RESILIENCY EMERGING PREPARERS AND MUTUAL AID FUND. TO HELP OUR LOCAL PARTNERS PREPARE FOR DISASTERS. THIS LEGISLATION AS A WHOLE WOULD HELP IMPROVE THE STATE OF MUTUAL AID IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE. CEMETERY IF DISASTER STRIKES AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE. MY GET MY BILL IS FOR THE FOR THE GOOD OF TAXPAYERS FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. INTO MITIGATION COMMUNITIES YOUR SAVE SIX DOLLARS DUE TO THE REDUCE FUTURE LOSSES. THIS WILL ALSO GIVE LOCAL ENTITIES THE FLEXIBILITY PART TIES RESILIENCY AND MITIGATION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE WE MAXIMISE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR FUTURE DISASTER VICTIMS. RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE CRITICAL HELPING PROTECT LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS WERE DISASTER STRUCK THE HARDEST FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER THE COST OF RETROFITTING. MULTI FAMILY SOFT STORY HOUSING VERSUS REPLACING THESE SAME STRUCTURES THANK YOU. THE COSTA RETROFITTING A UNIT IS APPROXIMATELY 500-021-0000 VERSUS THE ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND REPLACE A HOUSING UNIT. AGAIN THIS WALTARI SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE LONG RUN RESPECT US FOR ABOUT. ASSEMBLY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IF YOU HAVE THREE WITNESSES. TALKING IN SUPPORT YES THEY SHOULD BE IN FOR ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OF THEM HERE IN PERSON WE DO HAVE ONE FOR HONORABLY ON FROM OURS IF WE DO WE HAVE ONE PERSON COMING. YOU CAN COME UP. HI AND DARBY KERNAN ON BEHALF OF LEADING H. CALIFORNIA- IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO AB SEVENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE LONG TERM CARE MUTUALLY PLAN. IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE TO MAKE SURE OUR NURSING HOMES. HAVE A PLANNING CAN GET PEOPLE OUT OF ANY NEW OR ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS ARE ON THE PHONE WITH MORE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU RIGHT. THANK YOU I BELIEVE WE HAD THREE- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS. THAT WERE EVAN REES. RAY REARDON AND DON CHEN SKI. SO DO WE HAVE ANY OF THEM ON THE LINE. SEVEN REVIEWS HERE. IS OUR PRIMARY WITNESS A LITTLE SUPPORT. GO AHEAD. ALSO I DON'T OKAY THANK YOU MY NAME IS HENRY I'M A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NONPROFIT U. S. RESILIENCY COUNCIL FOR A SPONSOR AND SUPPORTER OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE. USRC MISSION IS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THROUGH ADVOCACY FOR MAKING BUILDINGS MORE RESILIENT TO NATURAL DISASTERS OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS ENGINEERING IN THE SERVICE OF EQUITY THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECONOMY AND I BELIEVE THAT AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE IN PARTICULAR THE PROVISION APPROPRIATING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN GRANT FUNDING TOWARDS THE SEISMIC RETROFIT OF SOFT STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS IT'S PERFECTLY WITH THAT DIED IN PRINCIPLE I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE WHY. CALIFORNIA HAS AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS WHICH ARE PRONE TO COLLAPSE IN EARTHQUAKES I NEXT UNREINFORCED BRICK BUILDINGS THEY MAY BE THE MOST DANGEROUS. OUTSIDE THE BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA. LAPSE OF SOFT STORY BUILDINGS RESPONSIBLE FOR OF DEATHS IN NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. ANYTHING MAY HOUSE UPWARD OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THESE TYPES OF BUILDINGS ARE TYPICALLY THE EASIEST SEISMICALLY RETROFIT. I THINK WE ADDING STEEL FRAME FOR WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST STORY PARKING AREA. RECORD OPERATING FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. COMPARE THAT TO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A TYPICALLY COST TO BUILD ONE UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE GOES TO THE HEART OF EQUITY AND SO MANY OF THESE BUILDINGS HOUSE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SENIORS LOWER INCOME FAMILIES THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. I CAN THINK OF NO OTHER WAY SEISMIC MITIGATION FUNDS COULD BE BETTER TARGETED TOWARDS SOCIALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THE RETROFITTING OF SOFT STORY APARTMENT BUILDING. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE ALSO HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR MIND. GREENEST BUILDING IS ONE THAT'S ALREADY BUILT PRESERVING THE STRUCTURES MEANS LEFT TO BRING IN LANDFILLS REACHING TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO OUR AIR WATER AND SOIL. AND LESS CARBON PUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE REPLACING DESTROYED BUILDINGS WITH NEW LAW. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE WOULD ALSO PROTECT OUR WORKFORCES OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL DESPERATELY NEED AFTER A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE. AND FINALLY AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING ENGINEERING A CONSTRUCTION JOB THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS LEGISLATION IN MY OPINION IT WILL BE MORE GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAN ANY SEISMIC LEGISLATION IN THE PAST.

THANK YOU VICE CHAIR SURCHARGE TO APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE. THE PROBLEM OF EXTENT OF ALL TIMES HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR DECADES AS YOU KNOW WHAT TIME OCCURS WHEN AN AMBULANCE ARRIVED AT A HOSPITAL. AND IS FORCED TO WAIT FOR THE HOSPITAL TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY OF CARE FOR PATIENTS. WHAT TIMES RESULT IN ULTIMATELY. UNTIMELY CARE FOR PATIENTS EXPERIENCING AND MERCY. AND PREVENTS I'M WITH PERSONNEL FROM RESPONDING TO OTHER EMERGENCIES. I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THAT SERVED. AS THE FIRST RESPOND FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND I REMEMBER WORKING ONE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFT AND I WAITED FOR OVER TWELVE HOURS AT A HOSPITAL TO TRANSFER PATIENTS TIMES ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE PATIENT. THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE AMBULANCE CREW. IN THE WATER UNDER CERTAINLY NOT GOOD FOR SOMEONE MAKING AN URGENT NINE ONE ONE CALL FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. WHEN THERE ISN'T AN ALBUM IT'S AVAILABLE TO DISPATCH. EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS COMMITTEE HOLD HELD AN OVERSIGHT. HEARING ON WHAT TIMES. WE HAVE SINCE. BEEN LEADING DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. TO IDENTIFY BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. I WAS AS A RESULT OF MY HEARINGS AND SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS I AM PLEASED TO SEE ADDITIONAL YOU MUST RESOURCES. DEPLOYED TO HOSPITAL TO HELP TRANSFER STABLE PATIENTS. FROM MEMBERS OF TO MERGING APARTMENTS. WELL THIS IS A GOOD OUTCOME IN THE SHORT TERM A REMAKE A MINUTE TO IMPLEMENTING OTHER SOLUTIONS.

ADDITION I THINK WE MUST BE PREPARED TO MAKE. A COMPREHENSIVE AND BALANCED APPROACH. WE CAN SOLVE THIS ON THE BACKS OF EMTS AND PARAMEDICS ALONE. WILL HAVE TO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO HOLD HOSPITALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELAYS REGARDLESS OF THE COSTS.

FOR THEM TO COME TOGETHER TO CREATE A PLAN TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS- AND OUTDOOR WORKERS A VOICE AND- TEXT MESSAGE ALERTS WHEN THE AIR QUALITY REACHES US AND DANGEROUS LEVELS DUE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE.

AND THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO TRIPLE BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY. THERE'S NO DENYING THAT WILDFIRE SMOKE POSES A THREAT TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RECENT STUDIES AND RESEARCH HAVE LINKED WILDFIRE SMOKE EXPOSURE TO CARDIOVASCULAR RESPIRATORY AND PRENATAL HEALTH IMPACTS.

IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMING OUT FARMWORKERS FROM MANY DIFFERENT- SOME DIRECTIONS AT ONCE AND YEAR OVER YEAR WORSENING EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE SMOKE IS MAKING THE DANGERS THAT THEY ALREADY FACE EVEN WORSE.
