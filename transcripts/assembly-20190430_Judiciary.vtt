00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.790
POPULATION THRESHOLD WAS STILL

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.759
BE REQUIRED TO SHOW A SPLIT THE

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.294
PROCEEDS WITH THE COUNTY THEN.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.562
YES THEY WOULD BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:51.763
TO FIRST GO TO THE DISTRICT

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.965
ATTORNEY TO GET PERMISSION. TO

00:28:54.032 --> 00:28:54.766
INITIATE LITIGATION THE FIRST

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:55.467
PLACE.

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:56.768
BECAUSE THE BIG CITIES DON'T

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.369
HAVE TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.604
DA WE THINK IT'S FAIR THAT THEY

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.638
SINCE THEY CAN ACT INDEPENDENTLY

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.140
AND FILING.

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:02.707
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.042
WHATEVER THEY GET BACK WITH THE

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.110
RATIONALE FOR SPLITTING THE

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:06.444
PROCEEDS WITH THE COUNTY TO

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.046
BEGIN WITH BUT QUITE HONESTLY

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.181
I'M NOT SURE I THINK IT'S A I

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.282
THINK IT GOT CAUGHT UP PROBABLY

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.851
IN THE DRAFTING IS IS YOU CAN

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.319
SEE FROM SEVENTEEN TO A SIX IT'S

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:14.819
IT'S LONG.

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.488
AND IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR WITH THE

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:17.922
VARIOUS LEVELS I THINK THE

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.190
TREATED ALL CITY ATTORNEY'S

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.392
TOGETHER -- AND THEN WENT BACK

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:23.261
AND CARVED OUT OF SOME

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.329
EXCEPTIONS FOR THE BIG CITIES.

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:25.697
UP BUT DIDN'T FIX THAT LITTLE

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:27.532
BIT SOMEONE WATER WAYS I THINK

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:28.967
IT JUST MAKES IT MORE CONSISTENT

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.702
WHAT'S WITH WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE

00:29:30.768 --> 00:29:32.103
THE INTENT OF THE DRAFTERS ALL

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.605

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.191
OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE EVICTING

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:47.758

AND FINALLY THE BILL MAKES CLEAR

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.062
THAT THE PAYMENT OF PUNITIVE

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:26.597
DAMAGES UNDER THE ACT DOES NOT

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:28.499
EXTINGUISH THE LANDLORDS

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.366

OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.827
EVEN WORKING CLASS IS A REALITY

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:57.561
THAT MAY.

00:39:57.628 --> 00:39:59.196
BE JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:01.198

JUST LET ME CLARIFY ONE THING --

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:16.013
A MY FATHER MISTER BURN READ IT

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.847
THAT WAY BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:17.181
TAKEN THOSE.

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.516

LAST SENTENCE OF THAT PAGE.

SAYS IN PERTINENT PART.

THAT SHOULD I AS A PROPERTY

TENANTS TO MOVE -- WE BELIEVE

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:31.976
THAT THIS IS A STRONG INCENTIVE.

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.811
FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER NEVER TO

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.446

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.483

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.784
BECAUSE THE TENANT HAS COME TO

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:09.466

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.168
HERE -- WE'VE ONLY HAD THIS

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.503

JUST TO EXPAND FURTHER THAT'S

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:22.779
NOT WHAT MISTER KING SENATE'S

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:23.614

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.816
THAT SECTION THE ONLY PURPOSE.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.317
OF THAT LANGUAGE.

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:30.187
IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WHATEVER

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:31.889

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.759
IN THE BUILDING SO SOME MAY HAVE

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:36.627
A SHORTER NOTICE AND SOME MAY

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:41.532
HAVE A LONGER NOTICE BECAUSE THE

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.200
LAW ALLOWS FOR EXAMPLE.

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.168
SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

FOR DETERMINING WHEN ALL THE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.385
OTHER TIME LINES IN THE BILL.

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:03.220
FOR THE LOG BEGIN TO RUN THAT

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:04.955
THAT DATE IS TRIGGERED.

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:08.825
A BY THE LAST TENANT -- THAT

DESCRIBING IT'S NOT --

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:32.015

THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM.

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:54.377
WHY DO I BELIEVE IT MIGHT BE A

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:56.112

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.424
RIGHT -- AND LET'S GET TO THE

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:08.191
CORE OF WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.960
PREVENT I WOULDN'T WANT TO ANY

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.795
AGENTS -- THAT ARE NOT CENSUS

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.630
EMPLOYEES KNOCKING ON DOORS

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:14.464
ASKING PEOPLE FOR IMMIGRATION

00:52:14.531 --> 00:52:19.703

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.338
ADVANTAGE OF THAT INFORMATION IN

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.472
DOING OTHERWISE.

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:23.073
I WOULD SENSES WORKER WOULDN'T

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:23.573

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.074
INFORMATION BUT LOOK.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.275
THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:26.710
HERE TOO IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:27.677
SURE THE CALIFORNIA GETS ALL

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:30.113
THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS WHICH I

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:35.285
THINK WE WOULD BOTH AGREE.

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:37.287
RIGHT BUT THIS COULD ALSO APPLY

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:38.855
TO OTHER YOU KNOW IS I MEAN I I

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.190
HAVE I GET THAT MAYBE THE TARGET

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:41.791
IS LIKE ICE.

00:52:41.858 --> 00:52:43.293
BUT WHAT IF IT'S JUST.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.895

WELL I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY

00:52:49.766 --> 00:52:51.234
FALSIFYING WHO THEY ARE KNOCKING

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.202
ON THE DOOR I THINK WE BOTH

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.671
AGREED -- THAT WE WANT THE

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:57.207
PUBLIC -- THE PUBLIC TO BE SAFE --

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.009
IF YOUR SENSES WORKER THEN

THAT'S FINE YOU CAN FIGURE

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:01.344
CENSUS WORKER -- BUT I THINK

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:02.579
MOST PEOPLE MOST REASONABLE

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:04.781
PEOPLE WOULD AGREE -- THAT YOU

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:05.248
WOULDN'T WANT SOMEBODY

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:09.219
MISREPRESENTING -- WHO THEY ARE

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:12.556
WHEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA DOOR

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:12.856
[inaudible]

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:16.993
RIGHT -- YEAH I MEAN.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:17.694
I GUESS FOR MORE SPECIFIC

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.195
TALKING ABOUT ICE OR ANY OTHER

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:20.964
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OUT OUT

00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:22.699
THERE.

00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.200
I SUPPOSE THAT THERE ARE.

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.001
YOU KNOW THEY USE STING

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:27.003
OPERATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.472
THEY USE IT IN THIS EXACT

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:29.706
FASHION.

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:31.841
AGAIN I NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:34.077
EVER.

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:37.380
COMING UP AS AN ACTUAL -- THAT

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:38.014
THIS WAS SOMETHING THEY ACTUALLY

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:40.750
DID -- BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:43.219
HAVE IN IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:43.887
RIGHT I I WOULD ASSUME YOU WOULD

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:46.189
WANT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:47.757
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GO OUT

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:49.826
AND USE STING OPERATIONS TO GET

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.261
OUT POLLUTERS.

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.163
YOU KNOW YOU WOULD WANT YOU KNOW

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.365
DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO WHATEVER

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.501
WHATEVER THEY ARE TASKED WITH

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.437
ENFORCING YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:01.404
GO OUT.

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:04.107
AND ENFORCE THE LAW THAT THEY'RE

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:06.376
SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE RIGHT EVEN

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:06.977
IF WE MIGHT.

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:07.844
LOOK.

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.713
I THINK A LOT OF US AGREE APPEAR

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:10.914
THAT.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.749
IMMIGRATION LAW HAS A LOT

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:13.717
THERE'S A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT AND

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:15.485

NONE THE LESS WE DO HAVE TO

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.557
ENFORCE THE LAW.

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.158
AND I THINK IN ANY OTHER

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:24.194
CAPACITY WOULD WANT TO SAY --

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.762
HADE AGENCY DON'T ENFORCE THE

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.765
LAW DON'T USE YOUR ENFORCEMENT

00:54:28.832 --> 00:54:32.802
POWERS. TO DO THAT RIGHT.

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:33.670
YOU MAY RESPOND OUT ALWAYS

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:35.071
WANTING YOU RESPOND I WAS TRYING.

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:37.574
TO PUT OUT LIKE THIS COULD HAVE.

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:39.476
OTHER PRESIDENTIAL IMPLICATIONS

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.877
RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.345
WELL NUMBER ONE THE ONE SAYING

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.880
FOLLOW OR DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:44.914
IN THIS BILL WITH THIS VERY VERY

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:48.451
SPECIFIC ABOUT NOT IMPERSONATING --

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:50.220
ANY INDIVIDUAL SO LET'S TAKE

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:51.855
THAT OFF THE TABLE NUMBER TWO IF

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:52.856
YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT I NEVER

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:53.890
HEARD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:55.492
PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:56.026
WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:56.860
WALKING IN IN IT.

00:54:56.926 --> 00:54:57.927
AND IF THERE IS A STING

00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.696
OPERATION THERE IS ALREADY A SET

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:01.798
PROCESS IN PLACE -- WE'RE NOT

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.033
CHANGING ANY OF THAT BASICALLY

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:06.269
WHAT THIS SAYS IS YOU CANNOT

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:09.005
IMPERSONATE SOMEONE -- WHAT WHEN

00:55:09.072 --> 00:55:09.673
YOU'RE NOT GOOD LORD WE KNOCKING

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:10.206
OR TALKING TO SOMEBODY TO

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:11.341
COLLECT INFORMATION?

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:12.609
SO I DON'T SEE ANY OF THOSE

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:14.177
OTHER ARGUMENTS BEING RELATIVE

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.745
BUT IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE YOU JUST

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.981
CAN'T FALSIFY -- IF YOU IF

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:19.716
YOU'RE A PUBLIC -- EMPLOYEE OR

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:22.052
AN OFFICIAL -- TO SAY THAT YOUR

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:23.653
FEDERAL AGENT -- GETTING OTHER

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.854
SORTS OF INFORMATION PRETTY

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:26.423
SIMPLE PRETTY NARROW BUT BUT I

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.491
THINK YOU MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.126
WOULD AGREE -- THAT ANY OF THE

00:55:30.193 --> 00:55:31.461
OTHER LAWS THAT ARE IN THE BOOKS

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.897
WE WOULD WANT THEM UP HELD THIS

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:35.465
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A BUT

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:36.099
LOOK I TELL YOU AT THE END OF

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.534
THE DAY WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE IS

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.035
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE STATE

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:39.402
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:40.470
WHICH I THINK.

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:41.304
MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE WOULD

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:43.740
AGREE -- THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:44.374
GET ITS FAIR SHARE FROM FEDERAL

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:45.442
GOVERNMENT.

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:46.376
ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S WHAT WE

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:47.444
NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND DO SO

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.079
IN AND WE NEED PEOPLE OUT THERE

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:50.346
TAKEN.

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:54.517
CENSUS INFORMATION RIGHT AND SO.

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:55.118
THE TWO I'M ON THE ELECTIONS

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.853
COMMITTEE WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.723
ON THIS RIGHT NOW -- YOU KNOW

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.725
I'M JUST.

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:02.892
NO WONDER WHAT WHAT THE

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.794
IMPLICATIONS OF OF THIS MIGHT BE

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:06.096
I I THINK MAYBE COULD EVEN BE

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:07.797
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT PREVENT

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.466
PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT RAY AND

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.034
AND TAKING CENSUS INFORMATION I

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:12.268
THINK THE ONLY INFORMATION IS

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:13.737
THAT IS THAT GIVEN THE

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:15.772
SENSITIVITY AND GIVEN THE FEAR.

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.073
FOR MISUSE OF THE SYSTEM ALL

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.942
THIS SAYS IS WHATEVER YOU CANNOT

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:21.077
REPRESENT YOURSELF AS A CENSUS

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:23.279
TAKER MUST YOUR CENSUS TAKER

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.280
THAT'S THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES.

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:25.215
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.649
SAYING LIKE COULD THIS STOP

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.084
COMMUNITY GROUPS FROM MAYBE

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.719
GOING OUT AND HELPING WITH

00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:32.288
CENSUS NOTE COLLECTION THAT

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:33.056
COULD BE ONE THING.

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:37.093
AND THEN AND THEN I GUESS.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:37.694
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S MANY

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:39.629
CASES WERE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.431
DO UNDER COVER OPERATIONS WHERE

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.532
THEY DO REPRESENT THEMSELVES TO

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.701
BE.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.202
SOMETHING SOMETHING ELSE.

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:47.437
IN ORDER TO GET OUT A LEGAL

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:48.738
ACTIVITY.

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:50.540
AND SO.

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.075
YOU KNOW DOES THAT SWORE

00:56:52.142 --> 00:56:54.010
LEGITIMATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:56.146
ACTIVITIES AS IS OR IS MY IS MY

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:57.680
CONCERNS OF THE BILL I I

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.281
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.382
FROM WITH IT.

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:01.084
BUT I THINK THERE COULD BE OTHER

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.685
IMPLICATIONS.

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.654
THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT

00:57:04.721 --> 00:57:05.388
HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:05.688
[inaudible]

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:06.756
YES.

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.857
WHAT NUMBER ONE AT THE I WOULD

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.392
TAKE BECOME BUT ALL THE LAW

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.794
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OFF THE

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.828
TABLE BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:12.796
PREVENT THEM IN IT?

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.164
AND IF YOU THINK THAT DOES I'D

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.732
LIKE TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK THAT --

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:16.332
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.268
ACTUALLY HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.736
ALREADY A PROCESS IN PLACE --

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.904
AND IT DOESN'T STOP COMMUNITY

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.372
GROUPS FROM PARTICIPATING ANY

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.307
ANY CENSUS WORK EITHER BECAUSE

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:25.308
IF THEY'RE NOT IMPERSONATING

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:26.476
THEMSELVES FALSELY THEN THAT

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.944
THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO ANY SORT

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.579
OF WORK -- YOU AND I CAN

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.848
CONTINUE -- TO KNOCK ON DOORS

00:57:31.915 --> 00:57:32.715
WITH THIS IN YOUR DISTRICT OR MY

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:35.685
DISTRICT TO HELP PEOPLE -- GET

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.021
COUNTED FOR THE CENSUS -- ALL IT

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:39.422
SAYS IS YOU AND I COULDN'T --

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:40.757
MRS REPRESENT OURSELVES A KNOCK

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.058
ON THE DOOR AND SAY THAT WERE A

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:45.195
CENSUS WORKER AND COLLECT OTHER

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:46.729
INFORMATION -- THAT'S ALL IT

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.731
SAYS.

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.099
SO I MEAN I THINK IF -- I MEAN

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.301
IF YOU DON'T IF IF -- I WOULD

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.502
HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSES

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:54.270
A BILL THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:56.639
FALSIFY WHO YOU ARE -- WHEN

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:58.575
YOU'RE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR?

00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:02.712
OR COLLECTING INFORMATION.

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.113
THANK YOU THIS IS US.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.682
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR.

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.550
THIS PREVENTS ONE ACTIVITY THAT

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:10.587
LAW ENFORCEMENT MIGHT UTILIZE --

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:13.256
HOWEVER DISGUSTINGLY -- TO GET

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:16.392
INFORMATION FROM AN INDIVIDUAL

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:18.795
TO HAVE THEM SELF REPORT THAT

00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:20.530
THEY'RE NOT -- HERE WITH

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:21.998
DOCUMENTATION CRACKED JUST ONE

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.800
ACTIVITY THAT'S LITERALLY

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.736
IMPERSONATING A CENSUS TAKER OR

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:27.837
OR ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT AND

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:29.639
ANYBODY ELSE WHO KNOCKS ON THE

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:30.907
DOOR WHO SAYS.

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.008
GRAHAM -- CENSUS WORKER CRACKED

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.276
I I'M JUST I I'M I'M A LITTLE

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:34.644
CONFUSED WHAT ROAD WE'RE GOING

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.379
DOWN WITH MY COLLEAGUE'S

00:58:36.446 --> 00:58:37.814
QUESTION.

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.015
SO SO.

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:41.718
ICE CAN STILL HOLD BOGUS -- COME

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:43.453
PICK UP YOUR LOTTO WINNIE AND

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.855
STING OPERATIONS THEY CAN STILL

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:46.990
GO TO A DOOR IF THEY HAVE AN

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.524
ARREST WARRANT THEY CAN STILL

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:51.661
PULL PEOPLE OVER IF THEY IF THEY

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:53.563
HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT --

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.031
THEY'RE HERE UNLAWFULLY IS THAT

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.699
CORRECT THIS WOULD BE CORRECT

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.334
THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY COULD NOT

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.603
IMPERSONATE SO THE ONLY ACTIVITY

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.437
ON THIS THAT WE'RE WE'RE

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:02.605
CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:04.607
IS NOT TO BE THAT SO PRECIOUS

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:05.441
AND SOME POINT WERE PUTTING

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:06.576
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:07.744
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO OUR

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.078
BUDGET ON TOP WITH THE FEDERAL

00:59:09.145 --> 00:59:10.413
GOVERNMENT SPENDS BECAUSE WE

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.981
WANT A COMPLETE COUNT AND ALL

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.650
WE'RE SAYING IS.

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.218
NOBODY SHOULD GO TO A DOOR.

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.654
AND SAY I AM A CENSUS TAKER IF

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.456
THEY ARE NOT CORRECT THAT IS ALL

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.625
THIS LADAS PLANE SIMPLY I AM OF

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:23.092
THE BILL.

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:23.793
SO I THINK IF WE DO HAVE A

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:30.066
MOTION AND A SECOND MR CHOLERA

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.668

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:36.673
CREDIBILITY. TO THE CENSUS

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.007
TAKING PROCESS.

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.909
THE REALITY IS AND ALONG FORSMAN

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:41.811
CONTACTS WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:42.912
STING OPERATIONS WHAT HAVE YOU --

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:44.013
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE AS A

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.014
ONE OFF INTERACTION THAT CENSUS

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:46.215
TAKERS HAVE.

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.984
WITHIN IT WITH INDIVIDUALS AS A

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:51.154
RUSE -- THE THE ONES THAT WOULD

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.522
MOST LIKELY USE IT WAS OUR ICE

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:53.923
OR OTHER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.358
WHICH ARE NOT PEACE OFFICERS

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.093
UNDER CALIFORNIA STATE LAW.

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.261
AND IT ALL COMES UNDER PUBLIC

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.796
POLICY DISCUSSION THE DECISION

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:03.566
ON A BALANCING ACT AT THE END OF

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.302
THE DAY.

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.171
A. N. ONE ICE AGENT.

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.539
IMPERSONATING A CENSUS TAKER FOR

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.106
THE PURPOSES OF DOING THEIR

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:11.708
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE SUCH

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.576
CHILLING AFFECT.

WHEN I'M IN SAN JOSE AND THERE'S

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.714
EVEN A RUMOR.

THE INFORMATION WILL NOT BE USED

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.635
FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE

THE PERSON AT THE DOOR -- IS NOT

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.477
A FALSIFYING WHO THEY ARE.

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.277

THAT IS NOT THAT CLEAR

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.499
UNDERSTATE LAW OR FEDERAL LAW.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:52.502

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.338
UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION IN THE

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:50.940
CAPTION OF THE LANDLORDS

01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:52.007
COMPLAINT.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.843
AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.144
ENSURE THAT WHEN A LANDLORD HAS

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:57.546
ELECTED TO EVICT A TENANT UNDER

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:58.914
THE LS ACT.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.416
NOT A PUBLIC EVICTION RECORD

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:04.620
DOES NOT UNFAIRLY PENALIZE THOSE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.721
TENANTS SO CURRENTLY.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.723
WHEN A LANDLORD DECIDES TO

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.160
RECLAIM THEIR PROPERTY THEY CAN

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:14.196
EVEN ACT A TENANT -- BUT WHAT

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.065
WILL IN IT AN ADVERT ONLY HAPPEN

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:16.799
IS.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.902
HE VIXEN WILL SHOW UP ON THE

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.370
TENANTS CREDIT REPORT.

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.105
EVEN THOUGH WHILE TECHNICALLY

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.940
THEY WERE AFFECTED THEY WERE

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:26.609
EVICTED THROUGH NO FAULT OF

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:28.944
THEIR OWN SO THIS IS A RATHER

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:32.148
SENSIBLE AND PRACTICAL SOLUTION

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:34.083
TO THAT SITUATION THAT CURRENTLY

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.318
EXISTS WE KNOW.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:39.955
THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.590
ARE DEALING WITH NOW.

01:07:41.657 --> 01:07:43.959
AND THE LACK OF SUPPLY MAKES IT

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.928
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR TENANTS

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.496
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR RENTAL UNITS

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:48.931
TO FIND THEM AND IT WOULD BE

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.233
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.303
IF THEY HAVE THIS THE VIXEN ON

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.771
THEIR CREDIT REPORT.

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.073
IT IS ALSO I THINK THE CHALLENGE

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.409
FOR LANDLORDS WHO ARE LOOKING

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:02.878
FOR PROSPECTIVE TENANTS -- TO

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:05.281
FIND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT A

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.316
SHRINKING POOL OF PROSPECTIVE

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.418
TENANTS BECAUSE THERE ARE FOLKS

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.020
OUT THERE THAT HAVE THE VIXEN

01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:13.222
NOTICES ON THEIR CREDIT REPORT

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.623
WHEN THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.158
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.161
SO THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN NINETY

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.296
FIVE WOULD ADDRESS THAT I

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:23.332

THE TENANTS CREDIT REPORT AND

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.942
IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.893
CASE OF THE ELLIS ACT.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.535
OWNERS.

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:56.305
IN MANY CASES THE AVERAGE SIZE

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:59.007
OF AN ELLIS ACT IS ABOUT TEN

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.976

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.357
IN MOST CASES IT'S VERY

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.092
EXPENSIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.094
AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING RENT

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.562
BECAUSE THE TENANT IS NOT GOING

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:23.298
TO PAY RENT UNDER THIS SITUATION.

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:25.000
SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.001
THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.402
EVICTION THIS CASE BECAUSE OF

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.637

THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THESE

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.303
ISSUES.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.604
COULD GET ACCESS TO THOSE

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:03.939
RECORDS THEY BASICALLY HAVE TO

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.374
KNOW ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.842
THE CASES ARE READY TO GET

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.110
ACCESS.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.211
UNDER THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.646
WRITTEN -- WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:11.547
WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:13.348
HAVING A GOOD DIALOGUE THERE SO

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.817
WE'RE HOPING WE CAN WORK OUT.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.618
MORE NARROW WAY -- TO ADDRESS

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.420
THE PROBLEM THIS BILLS AIMED AT

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.856
THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:21.757
IN OPPOSITION.

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:22.724
RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.127
THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.762
THIS REBUILDING.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:29.231
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.165
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE ELSE

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.934
ACT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.435
THAT UNDER THE ACT YOU CAN

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.571
PROVIDE NOTICE AND THE TENTATIVE

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:36.572
SUPPOSED TO MOVE OUT AT THE END

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:37.673
OF THAT NOTICE PERIOD OF THE

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.274
TENANT DOESN'T MOVE OUT AT THE

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:40.742
END OF THAT NOTICE PERIOD.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.743
THEN YOU HAVE TO FILE AN

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.612
EVICTION UNDER THE ELLIS ACT SO

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.180
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT.

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.949
YOUR BILL WOULD BE -- FOR

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:48.617
PROTECTING OTHER PEOPLE THAT

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.185
REFUSED TO MOVE OUT AFTER THE

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.220
END OF THE NOTICE PERIOD IS THAT

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:54.289
RIGHT BECAUSE I I'M JUST I'M

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.691
JUST WONDERING WHEN A WALK.

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.792
IT IF THESE PEOPLE THROUGH NO

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:58.260
FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAD TO MOVE

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.595
OUT THEN I THINK WE CAN ALL

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:00.929
AGREE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE ON

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.364
THEIR CREDIT REPORT BUT IF THEY

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:04.066
REFUSED TO MOVE OUT MAYBE THAT'S

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.434
SOMETHING THAT THAT SHOULD BE OF

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.070
CONCERN TO A FUTURE LANDLORDS OF

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:08.270
JUST.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:17.045
WONDERING HOW YOU REACT TO THAT

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:17.346
[inaudible]

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.681
THAT [inaudible]

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.216
ADAM.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.684
JOE DIRT TWO THINGS ON THAT

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.720
QUESTION I AM ONE THERE ARE A

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.655
VARIETY OF REASONS IN WHICH AT

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:27.189
THE TIME PERIOD THAT AS A

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:30.092
LANDLORD MIGHT BE ENTITLED TO

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:30.726
FILE THEIR ACTION.

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.193
THERE.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.996
ARE THAT THE ACTION COULD BE

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.297
FILED WITHOUT THE TENANT.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.466
WELL WE SEE FREQUENTLY AN ACTION

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:38.500
FILED EVEN THOUGH THE TENNIS

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:39.334
COMPLIED WITH THE NOTICE SO

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.069
THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY THAT THE

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:42.371
ACTION WOULD BE FILED.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.339
AND THE TENANT HAD MOVED OUT AND

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:47.109
SO THEN THEY WOULD BE IMPLICATED

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:50.579
POTENTIALLY IN ESSENCE -- TO IF

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.347
THE ACTION WERE PROSECUTED

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:53.749
FURTHER BY THE LANDLORD.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.584
SECONDLY THERE MAY ACTUALLY BE A

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:56.852
LEGITIMATE DISPUTE ABOUT THE

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.020
SUFFICIENCY OF THE NOTICE AND

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.855
THAT'S WHY OUR COURT SYSTEM

01:15:59.922 --> 01:16:01.623
PROVIDES THE REVENUES THAT IT

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:04.026
DOES TO ALLOW IT. TO DEFEND HIM

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:05.193
OR HERSELF AND SO.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.062
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO FAULT ON

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:08.597
BEHALF OF THE TENANT THEY WERE

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:10.599
ASSERTING A DEFENSE THAT THEY

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.600
ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER THE ELLIS

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:12.634
ACTIVE GET.

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.503
ADEQUATE NOTICE AND SO THAT MAY

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:18.173
LEAD ALSO -- TO TO THE ACTION

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.007
PROCEEDING IN A WAY THAT COULD

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:20.042
OTHERWISE SHOP ON THEIR CREDIT

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.076
REPORTS I THINK.

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.411
ALTHOUGH IN THE VAST NUMBER OF

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.112
CASES PEOPLE WILL MOVE OUT THERE

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:25.814
ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY ARE

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.050
LEGITIMATELY DEFENDING THEIR

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.452
RIGHTS OR HAVE HAD THE ACTION

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:33.188
PROCEED WITHOUT -- THEIR ABILITY

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.489
TO DEFEND BECAUSE THEY HAVE IN

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:35.557
FACT MOVED OUT AND THEN THAT

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:36.725
COULD SHOW UP ON THE RECORD AS

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:37.759
WELL OKAY BUT THE I MEAN THE

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.161
BILL'S VERY BROADLY WORDED.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.195
I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.496
THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT IT'S

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:42.531
GOING TO PROTECT JUST THE PEOPLE

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:43.966
WHO ARE CHALLENGING THE

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:45.434
SUFFICIENCY OF THE NOTICE.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.501
IT SAYING THAT IT'S ALSO GOING

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:49.738
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:50.305
TO IGNORE THE NOTICE AND NOT

01:16:50.372 --> 01:16:51.840
MOVE OUT.

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:53.942
THE BILLS DESIGNED TO PROTECT

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.744
THOSE TENANTS WHO.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.279
ARE GIVEN AN EVICTION NOTICE

01:16:57.346 --> 01:16:58.613
BECAUSE THE LANDLORD IS

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.949
RECLAIMING THE PROPERTY FOR

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:02.918
THEIR OWN USE.

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.353
THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.221
THESE TENANTS ARE BEING VICTOR

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.990
PUTS THE LAW ALLOWS THE LANDLORD

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.124
TO DO.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.793
RIGHT BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS THAT

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.995
YOU STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:15.697
THIS PROCESS AND RIGHT NOW THE

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.199
PROCESS IS CALLED.

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:18.900
EVICTION NOT NONE OF THAT'S

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:19.768
WHERE WE'RE DISAGREEING BECAUSE

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.570
WELL I MEAN IT.

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:23.572
THE LANDLORD PROVIDES NOTICE.

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:25.474
AND UNDER THE LAW THE TENANT HAS

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.875
TO VACATE WITHIN THE NOTICE

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.310
PERIOD IS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:28.844
DAYS.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:29.411
YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.013
VACATE.

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.748
IF THEY REFUSED TO VACATE.

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.383
THEN THE LANDLORD FILES AND

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.217
FICTION NOTICE UNDER THE ELLIS

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.052
ACT AND THAT FALLS UNDER THE

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:37.853
CATEGORY FOR BILL.

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.221
I MEAN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.022
PEOPLE WHO.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.723
HAVE -- YOU KNOW THROUGH NO

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.058
FAULT OF THEIR OWN BEING FORCED

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.192
OUT IN AND I'M I'M SURE OUR

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:44.960
HEARTS ARE WITH WITH THOSE

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:45.560
PEOPLE.

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:48.630
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:50.632
WHO HAVE REFUSED TO LEAVE.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:51.466
I IT LOOKS I MISUNDERSTAND WELL

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:52.067
THERE ARE A LOT OF INSTANCES

01:17:52.134 --> 01:17:53.135
WHERE.

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:55.637
INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE -- THE

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:59.508
TENANTS MAY WISH TO BE -- YOU

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:02.477
MAY BELIEVE THAT THE L. SECTION --

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:05.180
EVICTION IS OR THE REMOVAL

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:10.652
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT -- GUN. TO

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.454
THE NOTICES INSUFFICIENT THEY

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:13.188
KNOW THEY'RE THINGS THAT HAVE

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:13.488
BEEN DONE.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:14.523
INCORRECTLY EVERYTHING ELSE AND

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.024
THEY HAVE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.260
PROTECT THE RIGHTS -- THERE'S A

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.562
MENTIONED IN THE LETTER THAT

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.197
WOULD WAS RECEIVED THAT.

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.366
IS OVER IT'S CAN BE A YEAR'S

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:25.500
NOTICE BUT THEN THAT'S ONLY

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:30.372
LIMITED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.940
IS THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:32.541
NOTICES ARE A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:34.609
DAYS WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY LEFT

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:36.478
LESSENED THE LEGAL UNIVERSE.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.580
AND THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.549
WITH IT.ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.617
IS THAT IF YOU SEEK TO DEFEND

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.419
YOUR RIGHTS AS A TENANT. TO SAY

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.188
THAT THE NOTICES INSUFFICIENT OR

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.689
THEIR OTHER.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:50.025
OF FAILINGS IN THE EFFORTS TO

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.126
HAVE YOU REMOVED AND THE ELLIS

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:53.862
ACT WHATEVER THAT IF YOU DO THAT

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:56.131
WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME YOU'RE

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:57.666
NOT GOING TO BE REX KING.

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.201
BEING IN AN EVICTION SITUATION

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:01.503
AND THEREFORE YOUR CHANCES OF

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.672
GETTING HOUSING DOWN THE LINE.

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:06.074
ARE GOING TO BE -- CERTAINLY ARE

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:06.875
GOING TO BE HURT WHAT

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:08.810
SUBSTANTIAL JUST TO BE CLEAR IF

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.378
THE BILL HAD BEEN WORDED.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:15.016
SO THAT IF YOU CHALLENGED AND

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:15.917
ALICE ACT.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:16.885
EVICTION AND PREVAILED THAT THE

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.086
COURT RECORD WOULD SEAL.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:20.021
I THINK -- WE WOULD BE A 100%.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.456
BEHIND YOU BUT IT'S NOT WORTH IT

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:23.859
THAT WAY IT'S WORDED TO PROTECT

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.393
EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN CONVICTED.

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.728
UNDER THE ELLIS ACT EVEN THE

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.497
PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEY HAD TO

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.298
VACATE REFUSED TO VACATE DIDN'T

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.466
HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON FOR

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.701
REVIEWS THAT REFUSAL.

01:19:32.767 --> 01:19:34.803
AND THE LANDLORD HAD WAS FORCED

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.471
TO THAT THE SO I MEAN THAT THAT

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.572
THAT'S WHY I MEAN UNFORTUNATE

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.274
OFTEN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION --

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:40.809
IF IF IT HAD BEEN WORDED MORE

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.145
NARROWLY THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:47.849
TO BUT SUPPORT.

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:48.450
MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THOSE THAT

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:49.017
ARE PRESENT.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:49.618
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.786
THE COMMITTEE.

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.321
STEVE I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:54.389
COMMENTS THE YELLOW SECT IN MANY

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.457
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.259
INCLUDING MY OWN.

01:19:57.325 --> 01:19:58.660
HAS BEEN USED.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:19:59.995
TO EFFECT HUNDREDS OF NOT

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:02.497
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS -- AND IN

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.399
MANY INSTANCES THE ELLIS ACT HAS

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.268
BEEN FOUND TO BE A PRETEXT FOR

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.136
MOVING FOLKS OUT WITH CERTAIN

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.337
OWNERS WHO THEN.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:11.706
OUR RENT OUT APARTMENTS -- AFTER

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:14.509
NOT HAVING -- MOVE FOR WITH WHAT

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:15.710
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DONE ON

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:16.878
THE ELLIS ACT.

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.548
AND IN OTHER INSTANCES -- IT I

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:21.716
DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE WOULD

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.285
SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'VE LIVED IN

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.786
YOUR HOME FOR DECADES -- YOU

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.154
SHOULD DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.290
TRY TO STAY TO LIVE IN YOUR HOME

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.224
WHEN THE ALTERNATIVE IS BEING

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:30.358
FORCED OUT ON THE STREET AND

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.927
THAT'S AGAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.361
FIND A LOT OF THESE FAMILIES AND

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.362
AND SO.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:35.997
THE CHOICE THAT.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.099
I THINK THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.935
ADDRESSES. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.303
TO EXERCISE ALL OF THE LEGAL

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:44.105
RIGHT TO HAVE -- BUT BUT IN THIS

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:45.740
CASE THEY'RE FORCED -- TO

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:47.409
POTENTIALLY RISK HAVING THEIR

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:48.743
NAME BE PUT ON A COMMERCIAL

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.412
BLACKLIST THAT WOULD PREVENT

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.981
THEM FROM BEING A WELL

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.516
CONSIDERED BY FUTURE LANDLORDS

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.518
FOR UP TO SEVEN YEARS AND AND

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:57.986
AND I THINK THE IDEA THAT.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.754
GIVEN THAT THE STARTED --

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.389
BECAUSE OF AN ADDICTION THAT DID

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:03.258
NOT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.092
THAT WAS AT THE FAULT OF THE

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.995
TENANT -- WE SHOULD NOT FORCE

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:09.464
THEM TO THIS CHOICE OF WHETHER

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:10.398
TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS OR BE

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:11.566
PLACED ON A BLACKLIST FOR THE

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:12.367
NEXT SEVEN YEARS AND BECAUSE OF

01:21:12.434 --> 01:21:14.636
THAT -- I WILL ABSOLUTELY BE

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:15.971
SUPPORTING THIS AND HAVE BEEN

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:18.039
WITH US BEFORE THANK YOU WE DO

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:22.010
HAVE A MOTION SIR SECOND.

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.511
AND A SECOND.

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.180
THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:25.447
COMMENTS.

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.616
FEATURED OR CAN I JUST CAN I

01:21:27.682 --> 01:21:29.117
CLARIFY AND THE CAT CATEGORIES

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.452
AS INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU SAID THAT

01:21:30.518 --> 01:21:32.887
THIS WOULD APPLY TO SO YOU THINK

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.322
YOU SAID THAT.

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:35.390
THERE ARE THE PEOPLE IN STROBEL

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.826
EVERNOTE HE NOTED I WHO.

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:39.427
REFUSED TO LEAVE THERE ARE

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:40.862
PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN A

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:42.864
LEGITIMATE DISPUTE ABOUT THE

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.965
EVICTION PROCEEDINGS.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:44.966
SOUND LIKE YOU SAID THERE IS A

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.769
THIRD CATEGORY OF INDIVIDUAL WHO

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.971
ACTUALLY HAVE LEFT.

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.006
WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BUT

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.775
ARE STILL BEING FALSELY LISTED

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:55.343
AS BEING AFFECTED WITH THE DATA

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:56.511
THAT IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME YEAH

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.179
I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE SEEN

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.881
INSTANCES IN WHICH AND?

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.082
MR TO DID A BILL COUPLE OF YEARS

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.484
AGO TO TRY.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.119
TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT WE

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.421
WERE SEEING.

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.623
INSTANCES IN WHICH THE ACTION IS

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:09.891
FILED THEN THE TENANT.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.660
MOVED OUT OR MAYBE THEY MOVE OUT

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:12.994
SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION BEING

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.763
FILED THEY MAY NEVER GET NOTICE

01:22:14.829 --> 01:22:16.765
OF THE ACTION THEY GET A DEFAULT

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:19.034
AND THAT DEFAULT WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.837
THE LANDLORD TO GET AN ORDER OF

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:23.138
POSSESSION.

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.339
AND THEN THAT WOULD.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.174
WOULD THEN BE REFLECTED ON THE

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:28.443
TENANTS CREDIT REPORT AND SO I

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:28.843
THINK.

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.679
THERE IS THAT THAT IS A POSSIBLE

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.280
OUTCOME THERE'S ALSO THE

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.348
POSSIBLE OUTCOME IS YOU --

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.683
REITERATING OF A PERSON IS

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.551
DEFENDING THEMSELVES AND I THINK

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.253
JUST THE OTHER POINT THAT I

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.822
FAILED TO MAKE THERE WAS.

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:41.890
IF YOU HAVE.

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.625
THE COURT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:44.492
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:45.627
LANDLORD CAN GET POSSESSION BACK

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:47.262
THERE THEY CAN FILE THEIR

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.763
EVICTION ACTION THEY CAN PROCEED

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.764
TO A JUDGMENT QUESTION IS

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:50.899
WHETHER IT REFLECTS ON THE

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:51.966
TENANTS.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:55.003
CREDIT WORTHINESS AND IN THIS

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.705
INSTANCE BECAUSE AS MR SHE WAS

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.340
DISCUSSING AND THE AUTHORS

01:22:58.406 --> 01:22:58.673
POINTED OUT.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.242
A THERE'S REALLY NO FAULTS HERE

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.143
MAYBE THERE WAS A DISPUTE MAYBE

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.845
THERE WAS A DIFFICULTY SECURING

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.046
OTHER HOUSING BUT IT REALLY CAN

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.281
REFLECT ON THEM AS A TENANT.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:07.882
THAT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:09.617
KIND OF THING THAT WE SHOULD PUT

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.019
ON THE TENNIS GREAT REPORT FOR

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:14.522
SEVEN YEARS AND THAT'S I THINK

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.156
THE CENTRAL PREMISE BEHIND THIS

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.191
BILL.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.225
RIGHT NOW I DO I APPRECIATE SOME

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.393
OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.828
OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND YES WHEN

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:20.929
IT COMES IN THE BUSINESS WORLD

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:21.896
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.298
HEAR HAVE DATA TO MAKE GOOD

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:24.299
DECISIONS.

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:25.800
BUT I THINK IN THIS CASE

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.235
PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE

01:23:27.302 --> 01:23:29.504
SITUATIONS WHERE THAT DATA IS

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:30.238
FLAWED.

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:33.808
AND THE IMPLICATIONS AND THE AND

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.610
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DATA

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.411
BEING FIRED.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.246
ON SOMEONE'S CREDIT REPORT FOR

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:39.647
SEVEN YEARS IS.

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:42.317
MEANS ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:43.651
AND SO TO ME I THINK.

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:44.686
YEAH THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:45.854
I'M GONNA.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.123
YOU'RE ON THE SIDE OF MAKING

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:50.024
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HI.

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:51.359
RUNNING SOMEONE'S LIFE --

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:52.827
PERMANENTLY BECAUSE OF A

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.829
POTENTIALLY FIVE DATA.

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.598
I AND SOME HAVE TO SUPPORT THE

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:57.532
BILL TODAY THANKS [inaudible]

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:01.970
THANK YOU.

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:03.304
THIS ALL IN.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.906
YES I WAS GOING TO I WAS KIND OF

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:05.740
FOLLOW ALONG THE SAME LINES AT

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:09.744
THE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.180
ARE ARE -- NOTED AND AS I WAS

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:13.915
REFLECTING ON THE QUESTION BACK

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.884
AND FORTH I WAS ALSO TRYING TO

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:18.586
UNDERSTAND IF AFTER. THREE

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:19.220
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS IF THEY

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.556
STAY IN THE UNIT THAT THAT SORT

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.825
OF SPARKS AND NEED TO TAKE SOME

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.493
TYPE OF ACTION BUT I BETTER

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.096
UNDERSTAND THE CLARITY OF WHAT.

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:30.265
THE CHALLENGE WOULD REPRESENT

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:33.001
THAT THEY'RE STILL BLACKLISTED

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.102
FOR SEVEN YEARS AS I UNDERSTAND

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:34.969
IT AND THAT.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.805
SEEMS TO BE A BIT EXCESSIVE IN

01:24:36.871 --> 01:24:38.306
TERMS OF THEIR TRYING TO

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:41.109
CHALLENGE OR BETTER CLARIFY --

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:43.344
THE POSITION AND I GUESS ALL OF

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.113
THESE SITUATIONS WE KNOW THERE

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.082
ARE -- PROPERTY OWNERS OUT THERE

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:51.786
WHO -- CAN USE THESE.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:54.122
THEY ALL SUCK AND OTHER TOOLS TO

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.156
DO THE RIGHT THING AND THEN

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.292
THERE ARE THOSE WHO MAY NOT OR

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:58.426
MAY BE USING IT FOR OTHER

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:00.462
PURPOSES AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:03.298
SAN FRANCISCO -- NOTED SO -- I%

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:03.898
THINK UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:06.568
INTENT OF TRYING TO PROTECT --

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:09.370
FOLKS WHO ARE IN A SITUATION.

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:12.307
BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN -- TO

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:14.108
SAFEGUARD THEM FROM BEING PUT IN

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:17.645
JEOPARDY -- WITH THEIR CREDIT --

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:19.481
BEING PUT.

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:22.083
ON A SEVEN YEAR -- STATUS I

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.117
THINK THAT.

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.786
IT'S WORTHY OF THE SUPPORT I I'D

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.154
LIKE TO HAVE THOUGHT THAT THERE

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.355
WAS A WAY TO MAYBE EVEN.

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:30.658
FINE TUNE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE --

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.494
WITH SOME TYPE OF AN AMENDMENT

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.462
THAT WOULD ADDRESS.

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:39.167
WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED SO

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:40.969
THAT THERE'S?

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:42.504
ABOUT THAT LIGHT SHINING THROUGH

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.771
HERE THAT IT COULD BE SEALED A

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:44.405
LITTLE TIGHTER -- I DON'T KNOW

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:45.206
WHAT THAT WOULD BE AT THIS

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.307
PARTICULAR MOMENT -- BUT I WOULD

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.877
ENCOURAGE THERE TO CONTINUE TO

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:51.212
BE CONVERSATION AND AND THAT

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.113
PROCESS IF THERE'S A WAY.

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.582
TO SORT OF FINE TUNE A LITTLE

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.384
BIT MORE I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.386
THAT BUT AS IT'S WRITTEN TODAY

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.255
AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY.

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.723
OF SUGGESTED.

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.091
ALTERNATIVE I'M PREPARED TO

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:09.564
SUPPORT [inaudible] TWO OTHERS.

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.365
RIGHT THIS CALL NOT GONNA BE MAY

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:11.699
CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:14.102
MEMBERS -- WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:15.670
ANY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS FROM THE

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.005
OPPOSITION BUT BASED ON THE

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:17.872
CONVERSATION HAD HEARING

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:20.074
COMMITTEE I AM CERTAINLY WILLING

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.709
TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE SO THAT WE

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.144
CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO TIGHTEN

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:21.674
CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL AT

01:51:21.741 --> 01:51:23.009
THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:24.344
REASONS BUT I THINK THE MOST.

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:25.945
FUNDAMENTAL IS THAT I THINK IT

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:27.080
TURNS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:28.982
PRIVATE PROPERTY ON IT SAID AND

01:51:29.049 --> 01:51:30.550
AND I'M I'M I BELIEVE

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:32.952
FUNDAMENTALLY -- THE PROTECTION

01:51:33.019 --> 01:51:34.888
OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IS

01:51:34.954 --> 01:51:37.524
THE THING THAT THAT MAXIMIZES

01:51:37.590 --> 01:51:40.794
THE BENEFITS TO SOCIETY -- NO

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.362
ONE MORE THAN THAN THAN AN OWNER

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:44.130
OF LAND HIS MADE THE INVESTMENT

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.498
IN THAT LAND.

01:51:45.565 --> 01:51:47.500
IS MORE VESTED IN ENSURING THE

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:49.636
LONG TERM -- PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:51:49.702 --> 01:51:51.171
BENEFITS.

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:53.139
BENEFITS OF THAT PROPERTY -- AND

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:55.875
I THINK HISTORY IS JUST SHOWING

01:51:55.942 --> 01:51:57.477
THAT VERY CLEARLY -- AND WHAT

01:51:57.544 --> 01:51:59.679
WE'RE STARTING TO DO WITH THESE

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:01.181
TYPES OF LAWS IS.

01:52:01.247 --> 01:52:02.982
BEND IT MORE IN FAVOR OF NO NOW

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.784
THE TENET IS IS THE ONE THAT'S

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:05.819
IN CONTROL.

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:08.855
OF THE PROPERTY -- NOW.

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.223
OF COURSE THE TENANT WHO IS

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:12.258
LIVING IN A AN APARTMENT HAS A

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:14.427
VERY MUCH AN INTEREST -- IN THAT

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:17.964
PROPERTY -- BUT SO LONG AS THAT

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:20.166
TEN AND I THINK AGAIN THE THE

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:21.801
RECORD IS SEAN THIS VERY CLEARLY

01:52:21.868 --> 01:52:23.403
AND SO LONG AS THAT TENANT.

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:25.738
IS PAYING RENT AND IS KEEPING UP

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:27.640
THAT PROPERTY AS IN KEEPING UP

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:29.075
THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:31.010
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PRIVATE

01:52:31.077 --> 01:52:33.746
INTERESTS ANY VICTIM THAT PERSON.

01:52:33.813 --> 01:52:36.583

ZACH LEE WHAT.

01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:39.619
IS GONNA KEEP THAT PROPERTY

01:52:39.686 --> 01:52:41.488
PRODUCTIVE AND BENEFICIAL FOR

01:52:41.554 --> 01:52:43.656
THAT LANDLORD LONG TERM.

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:46.259
I DON'T SAY THIS IN A VACUUM.

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:46.960
I'M A TENANT.

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.495
I'M A TENANT FARMER.

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.163
AND WE HAVE FORMED THIS THE SAME

01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:52.232

HAVEN'T BEEN KICKED OFF LINE I'M

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:57.504
SURE THERE'S OTHERS WHO COULD

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.139
OFFER MORE MONEY. FOR THAT

01:52:59.205 --> 01:53:00.573
PROPERTY BUT THE FACT OF THE

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.307
MATTER IS WE'VE MADE THE

01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:03.176

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:07.113
BUT THEY HAVE THE FULL RIGHT TO

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:10.016
DO SO IF OUR LEASE IS UP.

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.184
YOU KNOW THEY COULD MAKE THAT

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:12.685
DECISION TO GO HEY THIS IS MY

01:53:12.752 --> 01:53:14.154
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND AND AND

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.488
ULTIMATELY.

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:16.789
THAT IS THE THING THAT WILL

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:18.424
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO LONG TERM

01:53:18.491 --> 01:53:19.459
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:53:19.526 --> 01:53:21.161
OF THAT AND AND I THINK THE SAME

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:23.796
THING IS IS IS CLEAR HERE.

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:24.931
HERE'S THE OTHER THING IT DOES

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:26.499
TO ME.

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:28.134
IS I THINK WITH THE MORE WE GO

01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:30.303
DOWN THIS ROAD WITH THESE LAWS

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:31.738
IT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES MORE.

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:35.074
SLUM LORD TYPE ACTIVITY.

01:53:35.141 --> 01:53:36.075
WHO'S GOING TO COME IN AND MAKE

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.577
THE INVESTMENT ON A PROPERTY

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.646
THAT HAS BECOME DEBILITATED IT'S

01:53:39.712 --> 01:53:42.215
FULL OF COCKROACHES THAT HAS.

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:44.751
IN UNINHABITABLE -- CONDITIONS

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:46.252
IF THEY WON'T THEN HAVE THE

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.921
RIGHT TO ACTUALLY UPGRADE THAT

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.022
PROPERTY.

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:50.890
DEATH TO DO ELECTIONS TO CLEAN

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:53.459
IT UP AND AND AND BRING YOU

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.061
BRING IT UP TO STANDARD AND THEN

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:56.462
WE OFFER IT TO PEOPLE.

01:53:56.529 --> 01:53:57.463
REBEL WHO'S GONNA MAKE THAT IF

01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:59.732
THEY CAN'T FULLY CONTROL.

01:53:59.799 --> 01:54:02.202
THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY WHEN THEY

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:03.636
COME IN TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT.

01:54:03.703 --> 01:54:05.405
TO MAKE IT BETTER -- YOU KNOW

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.739
AND I THINK THAT IS VERY OFTEN

01:54:06.806 --> 01:54:08.808
THE CASES WE HAVE INVESTORS WERE

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:11.144
WILLING TO GO INTO -- PROPERTIES

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:13.379
THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR.

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:14.847
MAKE THAT INVESTMENT WITH ALL

01:54:14.914 --> 01:54:16.049
THE RULES AND RESTRICTIONS THAT

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:19.285
WE ARE NOW PUTTING ON LANDLORDS.

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:21.254
AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT.

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:23.423
THERE'S GONNA BE LESS INCENTIVE

01:54:23.489 --> 01:54:25.258
FOR PEOPLE TO DO SO AND TO ME

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:25.892
THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:28.861
MORE -- HIM THEY MIGHT BE RENT

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.463
CONTROLLED.

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.465
THEY MIGHT MAYBE WE IMPLEMENT

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:35.535
JUST BECAUSE BUT THEY'RE STILL

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:36.936
GONNA BE SLUMS AND THEY'RE GOING

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.504
TO CONTINUE TO BE BECAUSE NO

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:40.173
ONE'S GONNA MAKE THAT INVESTMENT

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.908
TO MAKE THEM BETTER -- SO I

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:43.710
WOULD THINK IT'S AN OVERALL BEST

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.278
INTERESTS LONG TERM OF OF

01:54:45.345 --> 01:54:46.713
INCREASING THE QUALITY OF OUR

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:49.048
HOUSING. TO ENSURE THAT

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:50.650
LANDLORDS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:52.318
WITH THEIR PROPERTY.

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:55.788
AS THEY SEE FIT -- YOU KNOW IT

01:54:55.855 --> 01:54:57.290
OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S GONNA

01:54:57.357 --> 01:55:01.494
BE A DISINCENTIVE -- AND THEN I

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.463
THINK YOU KNOW FINALLY THE REAL

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:05.331
REASON THAT WE HAVE MANY OF

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.799
THESE PROBLEMS AS WE HAVE.

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:07.934
AS WE ALL KNOW WE'VE TALKED

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:09.636
ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES BUT WE WE

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.204
DON'T REALLY DO MUCH ABOUT IT.

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:13.006
IS WE HAVE A HOUSING SUPPLY

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:14.274
PROBLEM.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.308
THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:16.976
HOUSING.

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:17.877
THERE'S NOT A LOT THERE'S NO

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:18.878
ROOM THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.146
TO GO ANYWHERE THERE'S NOT

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:21.381
COMPETITION.

01:55:21.447 --> 01:55:22.982
SO WHEN THERE ARE SLAMMED RENT

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.517
CONTROLLED MAYBE THE RENT

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:26.386
CONTROLLED SLUMS WHERE ELSE YOU

01:55:26.452 --> 01:55:27.453
GONNA GO.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:28.755
RIGHT -- WHEN YOU GET EVICTED

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.156
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T SUPPLY AND

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:32.191
WE CONTINUE TO PUT LAWS IN PLACE

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:34.127
THE GREATEST ENEMY?

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:36.996
OF THE TENANTS TODAY IS MORE LAW.

01:55:37.063 --> 01:55:38.698
IN MY OPINION ACTUALLY.

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:40.066
WE'VE WE'VE CREATED MORE MORE

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:42.235
LAWS THE BIGGEST ONE NICK DID

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:43.903
THAT KEEPS MANY PROJECTS --

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.371
MOVING FOR THE SEQUEL WE ALL

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:46.873
KNOW THAT.

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:47.740
AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM KNOWS

01:55:47.807 --> 01:55:49.542
THAT CALIFORNIA BARMAN EQUALITY

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:51.210
ACT STOPS GOOD PROJECTS FROM

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:52.578
GOING FORWARD AND ALL OF OUR

01:55:52.645 --> 01:55:55.415
URBAN AREAS -- NIMBY ISM.

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:57.150
STOPS GOOD PROJECTS FROM GOING

01:55:57.216 --> 01:55:59.952
FORWARD IN ALL THESE AREAS AND

01:56:00.019 --> 01:56:01.120
THEY USE THE LAW.

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:02.355
DIFFERENT LAWS ARE PUT IN PLACE

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:04.657
THE ABUSE IT. TO STOP THOSE

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:06.125
PROJECTS FROM GOING AND SO WE

01:56:06.192 --> 01:56:08.094
DON'T GET THE LOW INCOME.

01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:09.929
AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.664
THAT WE COULD GET IN MANY AREAS

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.466
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BOUNCING

01:56:13.533 --> 01:56:15.068
BODY CHANGING SEQUEL.

01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:16.769
EXCEPT FOR A FEW PEOPLE.

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:17.937
AND MY AND THE ONLY TIMES THAT

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:19.639
WE DO DO IT SEEMS TO BE FOR

01:56:19.706 --> 01:56:22.842
STADIUMS AND ARENAS.

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:23.643
BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT REALLY

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:26.679
DOING THAT YOU KNOW -- TO ENSURE

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:28.481
THAT MORE HOUSING COMES ONLINE

01:56:28.548 --> 01:56:30.350
THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.851
THAT IS WHY HOUSING AND RENTS

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:33.119
ARE SO HIGH.

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:35.455
AS WHY AT THE PRICE TO BUY YOUR

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.690
FIRST HOUSE IS SO HIGH.

01:56:37.757 --> 01:56:39.926
IN THESE TYPES OF BILLS DON'T DO

01:56:39.992 --> 01:56:41.494
ANYTHING TO GET AT THE HEART.

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:44.030
OF THAT ISSUE -- SO FOR ME I

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:45.164
THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:46.833
REAL FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND I

01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:47.700
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:50.002
ESTABLISHING A DISINCENTIVE IS

01:56:50.069 --> 01:56:51.637
THAT LONG TERM.

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:55.408
IS GOING TO LEAD -- TO LESS

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:57.076
QUALITY HOUSING FOR ALL.

01:56:57.143 --> 01:57:00.446
THIS IS TRUE.

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:02.482
LET ME START BY -- RESPOND TO A

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:04.016
FEW POINTS OUT THAT I WASN'T

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:05.351
GONNA RAISE BUT I THINK THE

01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:07.420
SUGGESTION OF THAT IF YOU ARE A

01:57:07.487 --> 01:57:09.389
GOOD TENANT THERE'S NO REASON TO

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:11.090
RAISE THE RENT.

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.326
HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG.

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.161
HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG MILLIONS

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:17.029
OF TIMES IN RECENT YEARS RENTS

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:18.364
HAVE BEEN RAISED.

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:21.134
ON THE GOOD PEOPLE CALIFORNIA.

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.301
DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS

01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:23.269
IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY IN THE

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:25.171
PAST TEN YEARS ALONE THE MEDIAN

01:57:25.238 --> 01:57:26.339
RENTING CALIFORNIA'S BEEN

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:27.807
INCREASED BY OVER A THIRD WHILE

01:57:27.874 --> 01:57:30.243
MEDIAN INCOME HAS REMAINED FLAT.

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:31.577
AND AT THIS TIME OVER HALF OF

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.679
ALL RENTERS OVER 80% OF LOW

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.281
INCOME RENTERS THEIR RENT BURDEN

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:36.516
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE PAYING

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:37.617
OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME

01:57:37.683 --> 01:57:39.952
TOWARDS RENT -- AT THIS TIME

01:57:40.019 --> 01:57:42.121
THERE CALIFORNIA PAIN FIFTY

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:43.689
BILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR HOUSING.

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.658
AND THEY CAN AFFORD IT'S A VERY

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.927
DIFFERENT PROBLEM THAT I THINK --

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:49.595
WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THE MEALS

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:51.864
RESPONDED THE SUGGESTION THAT WE

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:53.833
CAN BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS.

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.436
IT'S THE ESTIMATE IS

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:57.637
CALIFORNIA'S THREE AND A HALF

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.305
MILLION UNITS BEHIND WHERE WE

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:00.173
NEED TO BE.

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.375
IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY WILL

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:03.176
TELL YOU.

01:58:03.242 --> 01:58:04.844
THAT IF WE ENTITLE THREE AND A

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:06.412
HALF MILLION UNITS OF HOUSING TO

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:07.280
DAY.

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:08.581
IT WILL TAKE US YEARS OF NOT

01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:10.283
DECADES TO BUILD.

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.150
AND YET WE HAVE MILLIONS OF

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.519
TENANTS WHO ARE ONE TO RENT

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:15.521
INCREASE AWAY FROM BEING FORCED

01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:17.156
OUT OF THEIR HOMES OF DECADES

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:17.924
BEING FORCED OUT ON THEIR

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:20.860
STREETS FORCED OUT OF OUR STATE.

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.962
LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT

01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:24.864
THIS BILL -- THIS BILL IS

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:27.633
CRITICAL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE --

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.702
THAT TO WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:31.504
BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.872
WE'RE ALSO PROTECTING TENANTS --

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.106
THIS IS A BILL THAT WORKS HAND

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:35.975
IN HAND WITH AN ANTI RANK OUT

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:37.343
YOUR BILL THAT I HAVE PROPOSED

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:38.377
WHICH WOULD PREVENT RAIN

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:39.879
INCREASES ABOVE.

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:42.281
CPI PLUS 5% OR ESSENTIALLY 8% A

01:58:42.348 --> 01:58:44.851
YEAR -- AND AS MR BONTA SAID

01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.252
IT'S IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THESE

01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:47.620
BILLS MOVE FORWARD.

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:48.588
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE RANK OUTING

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:49.889
PROTECTIONS WITH NO JUST CAUSE

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:51.924
PROTECTIONS IF YOU CAN'T RAISE

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:52.925
RENTS ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.560
CONVICT THEM FOR ANY REASON BUT

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:55.828
IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

01:58:55.895 --> 01:58:57.263
IF YOU CAN'T VIC SOMEONE FOR ANY

01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:57.964
REASON BUT YOU CAN

01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:59.332
CONSTRUCTIVELY EVICTED BY

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:00.900
DOUBLING THE RANT.

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:04.237
WE'RE BACK IN THE SAME PROBLEM.

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:04.837
I WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS.

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:06.205
TO THE INDUSTRY AND I DO KNOW

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:07.907
THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:09.475
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS.

01:59:09.542 --> 01:59:11.010
WE HAVE HEARD THE INDUSTRY

01:59:11.077 --> 01:59:12.712
POTENTIALLY REFERENCE THE OREGON

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:14.680
BILL THE CPI PLUS SEVEN BILLS A

01:59:14.747 --> 01:59:16.215
MODEL TO LOOK AT I'LL JUST POINT

01:59:16.282 --> 01:59:17.116
OUT THAT THAT IS A BILL THAT

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:18.684
INCLUDES JUST BECAUSE

01:59:18.751 --> 01:59:20.253
PROTECTIONS AND SO AGAIN.

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:21.554
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WORK OUR

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:23.589
WAY TO A SOLUTION IN THE COMING

01:59:23.656 --> 01:59:25.791
WEEKS AND MONTHS ON THIS -- I

01:59:25.858 --> 01:59:28.361
WOULD ALSO SUGGEST I'VE HEARD.

01:59:28.427 --> 01:59:31.731
IT I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE THE

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:33.866
THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS TO WHY

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:35.468
THIS BILL SHOULDN'T MOVE FORWARD

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:37.203
AND AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS.

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.371
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:41.274
SPECIFIC CAUSES THAT WE SHOULD

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:42.909
CONSIDER CAN CONTINUING -- OR

01:59:42.975 --> 01:59:44.577
ADDING IF THEY'RE AT FAULT

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.612
CAUSES OR NO FAULT CAUSES THAT

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.281
THIS BILL IS MISSING I THINK

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:50.616
THAT IS A WELCOME DISCUSSION --

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.785
I'VE HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:54.120
SOMEHOW CURRENT LAW DOESN'T

01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:56.389
ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THE THE

01:59:56.455 --> 01:59:58.157
STORY OF THE DRUG DEALING TENET.

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.225
AND THE CHALLENGES FACING THIRD

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:01.127
PARTY WITNESSES AS A FORMER

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:02.862
CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I DO THINK

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:05.097
THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO GET OUT

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:07.433
THOSE CASES BUT I THINK THAT IS

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.268
A LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION.

02:00:09.335 --> 02:00:10.836
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE -- BUT

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:12.171
TAKING A STEP BACK I DON'T THINK

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:13.506
THAT'S A REASON TO SUGGEST THAT

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:15.107
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A JUST CAUSE

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:17.076
LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:19.478
AT ALL -- IS.

02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:22.281
WE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF SUCH

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:23.716
AN INTENSE CRISIS AND WE NEED

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:25.751
SOLUTIONS HERE -- WE'VE HAD MANY

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:26.919
CITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:00:26.986 --> 02:00:27.720
IMPLEMENTED JUST COST

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:30.056
PROTECTIONS IT HAS NOT HARMED

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:31.023
THE RENTAL MARKET IN THOSE

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:31.557
CITIES.

02:00:31.624 --> 02:00:34.026
AND AND I DO THINK THIS IS A

02:00:34.093 --> 02:00:36.762
VERY REASONABLE -- SET OF

02:00:36.829 --> 02:00:39.098
POLICIES AGAIN TO PROTECT --

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:40.333
SEVENTEEN MILLION RENTERS WHO

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:42.034
ARE ALL AT RISK AT THIS TIME SO

02:00:42.101 --> 02:00:43.135
WITH THAT.

02:00:43.202 --> 02:00:44.870
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS HOPE WE

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:45.638
CAN MOVE THIS OUT OF THIS

02:00:45.705 --> 02:00:46.839
COMMITTEE AND WILL MAKE THE

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:52.011
MOTION THAT WE DO SO THANK YOU

REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES AND YOU

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:06.025
KNOW THE I LIVE AND I REPRESENT.

02:01:06.092 --> 02:01:08.027
SAN JOSE -- OUR METRO AREA IS

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:10.896
THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING

02:01:10.963 --> 02:01:11.330
MARKET IN THE NATION

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:11.631
[inaudible]

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:16.268
AND MY DISTRICT INCLUDES NOT

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.470
ONLY SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST.

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:19.939
PORTIONS OF OF CALIFORNIA --

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:21.107
INCLUDING THE CAPITAL OF THE

02:01:21.173 --> 02:01:23.409
DOWNTOWN OF SAN JOSE IT ALSO

02:01:23.476 --> 02:01:24.710
INCLUDES THE LOWEST INCOME AND

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:26.379
POOR A CENSUS TRACTS OF SILICON

02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:27.647
VALLEY AS WELL.

02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:28.514
I WOULD NEVER REFERRED ANY THE

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:31.751
MUSLIMS I GO THERE OFTEN AND

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:32.718
THEY'LL GIVE ME A PLEASE NO

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:34.220
AUDIBLE RESPONSE AND THEY'RE

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:35.788
GREAT FAMILIES THAT LIVE THERE.

02:01:35.855 --> 02:01:37.757
I WILL SAY THAT ON A NUMBER OF

02:01:37.823 --> 02:01:38.858
OCCASIONS IN FACT I WAS WHEN THE

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:40.259
INSTIGATORS LAWS ON CITY COUNCIL

02:01:40.326 --> 02:01:43.663
THE RESPONSIBLE LANDLORD

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:45.398
IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE --

02:01:45.464 --> 02:01:46.065
STARGAZER INITIATIVE BECAUSE WE

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.333
HAD A LOT OF MULTI FAMILY

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.801
APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE ON THAT

02:01:48.868 --> 02:01:50.636
BILL THE OWNERS WERE NOT UP

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:51.804
KEEPING THE PROPERTY AND THE

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:52.938
FAMILIES IS HARD WORKING

02:01:53.005 --> 02:01:54.106
FAMILIES.

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:56.342
WERE SUBJECTED TO REALLY POOR

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:56.976
LIVING CONDITIONS WE LITERALLY

02:01:57.043 --> 02:01:59.078
HAD TO TAKE -- PROSECUTORIAL

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:01.347
ACTION -- IN ORDER TO FORCE THEM

02:02:01.414 --> 02:02:02.815
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:04.383
PROPERTIES AND TO MAKE IT SAFER.

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:05.785
FOR THEIR TENANTS.

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:07.853
I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.689
THAT THE BAD APPLE ARGUMENT IS

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.957
ALWAYS USED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:14.760
JUST BECAUSE THE REALITY IS A

02:02:14.827 --> 02:02:15.327
LOT OF GOOD APPLES ARE BEING

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:16.128
THROWN OUT.

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:18.998
BY EITHER -- OF ADDICTION

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:21.400
WITHOUT THE NEED FOR CAUSE OR

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:22.435
BUT WHAT WHAT AMOUNTS TO

02:02:22.501 --> 02:02:23.869
ADDICTION BY THEIR DRAMATIC

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:24.970
INCREASE OF RENT.

02:02:25.037 --> 02:02:27.173
WE'RE IN A CRISIS MAYBE NOT I'D

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:28.541
BE PART OF THE STATE SEES IT IN

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:29.642
THAT SAME WAY THAT I SEE IT

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:31.143
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

02:02:31.210 --> 02:02:31.977
WITH THE NUMBER OF CHRONIC

02:02:32.044 --> 02:02:33.579
HOMELESS INCREASING WITH

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.414
FAMILIES THAT CONTACT OUR OFFICE

02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:36.248
BECAUSE THEY'RE AT THE BRIDGE OF

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.750
BEING A VICTIM I CAN'T DO

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.351
ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:40.653
I'M NOT SAYING LOOK.

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:41.620
HI MY FAMILIES LIVE IN

02:02:41.687 --> 02:02:43.456
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'VE BEEN A

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:44.757
RENTER.

02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:47.860
HOMEOWNER AND UP -- MY AWARE WE

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.462
HAVE A SON IN POP OR SODA POP

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:50.162
LANDLORDS.

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:51.931
I GET IT I'M I I DON'T THINK

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:53.599
THAT ANYONE IS SAYING THAT THERE

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:54.233
SHOULD BE AN ABILITY FOR SOMEONE

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.468
TO PROFIT.

02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:56.969
BUT TO SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT

02:02:57.036 --> 02:02:58.604
PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS SHOULD

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:01.273
BE ABOVE ALL THE ONLY THING THAT

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.441
WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT AND

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:03.075
THAT THEY'LL JUST TAKE CARE OF

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:04.677
THEIR OWN.

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:05.745
ALTHOUGH TAKE CARE THE BUT IT

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:06.679
WILL THAT WHAT WAS SAID WAS WELL

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.047
WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THE BEST

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.181
VALUE COMES OUT OF THAT PROPERTY

02:03:09.248 --> 02:03:10.149
YEAH THEY'RE RIGHT.

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.717
THE BEST VALUE WILL COME OUT OF

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.352
THAT PROPERTY FOR THAT OWNER.

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:14.820
BUT WE HAVE A PUBLIC PLAN IN

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:16.388
FACT THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED.

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:22.728
BY GIVING RIGHTS ONLY TO WHITE

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:23.529
PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:25.164
AND SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:25.798
ABOUT NOW IS WE AS LEGISLATORS

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:26.599
OF A PUBLIC POLICY.

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:27.700
CRISIS ON OUR HANDS BECAUSE OF

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.168
THE OUT OF CONTROL PROPERTY

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:31.270
VALUES HOME CLASS RENTAL.

02:03:31.337 --> 02:03:33.205
COSTS AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.807
SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND I AND I

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:35.374
TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVEN THE

02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.442
OPPOSITION.

02:03:36.509 --> 02:03:38.110
OF UNDERSTANDS THAT I MEAN I

02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:39.378
THINK I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:40.379
THEM BUT CERTAINLY THE LOCAL

02:03:40.446 --> 02:03:41.380
LEVEL THEY GET THAT WE'RE IN A

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:42.681
CRISIS MODE WE ALL AGREE WE NEED

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:43.482
TO BUILD MORE.

02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:44.984
YOU COME TO SAN JOSE YOU'LL SEE

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.019
PLENTY OF BUILDING HAPPENING --

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:48.087
AND I'M GONNA KEEP BUILDING

02:03:48.154 --> 02:03:49.688
AFFORDABLE MARKET RATE YOU NAME

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.657
IT ALWAYS ENCOURAGE THAT.

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:53.392
BUT IN THE MEANTIME -- FAMILIES

02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:54.927
ARE STRUGGLING AND AND AT THE

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:57.129
END AND TOO MANY OF THEM ARE ONE

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:58.564
PAYCHECK AWAY ONE MEDICAL

02:03:58.631 --> 02:04:00.432
EMERGENCY AWAY -- FROM BEING

02:04:00.499 --> 02:04:02.067
HOMELESS AND FAR TOO MANY LIVE

02:04:02.134 --> 02:04:03.903
IN THEIR CARS OR OR OR IN STABLE

02:04:03.969 --> 02:04:05.004
RIGHT NOW.

02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:07.006
AND SO I I THINK THAT THESE ARE

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:08.874
TOOLS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:10.543
ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CRISIS.

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:14.380
AND I I THINK THAT THE THE FEARS --

02:04:14.446 --> 02:04:16.382
HAVING AGAIN.

02:04:16.448 --> 02:04:18.150
BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:19.618
HAD TENANTS THAT WERE TROUBLE

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:20.753
TENANTS AND YES IT TAKES SOME

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.087
EFFORT -- MEANT TO DEAL WITH

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.956
THOSE ISSUES BY THE END OF THE

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:25.124
DAY.

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.492
THE OBLIGATIONS IT SHOULD BE

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:27.860
SUCH THAT PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:33.265
PROTECTED WHAT THAT THOUGH THE

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:33.799
WEATHER THE RENTING OR NOT

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:35.701
THAT'S THE HOME.

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:36.702
THIS IS NOT TALK MY REVEAL IT

02:04:36.769 --> 02:04:37.703
WITH RENTING A LOCKER OR

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:38.337
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THIS IS OUR

02:04:38.404 --> 02:04:38.537
HOME.

02:04:38.604 --> 02:04:39.638
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY COGNIZANT

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:40.539
OF THAT AND I HAVE PRACTICED

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:41.073
THEM OR TENANT LAWS WELL.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.541
AND UNDERSTAND HOW HOW DIFFICULT

02:04:42.608 --> 02:04:44.476
IT IS WHEN TENANTS ARE TRYING.

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:45.177
TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:46.912
EMPOWERMENT EVEN IF THEY HAVE

02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:48.781
LAWS PROTECTING THEM THE RED THE

02:04:48.848 --> 02:04:51.250
REALITY IS THAT -- THE DATA THAT

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:52.418
THE THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:57.690
THEM -- AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:58.190
BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL

02:04:58.257 --> 02:04:58.490
[inaudible]

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.593
THANK YOU.

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:02.161
ALL RIGHT THE SPONSOR.

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:02.795
I THINK JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:04.496
A IT IT IT SADDENS ME TO QUITE

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.832
TENANTS AND PRODUCTIVITY ON THE

02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:08.500
LANDS WHICH IS CLEARLY AN

02:05:08.567 --> 02:05:10.069
AGRICULTURAL CONCEPT AND THE

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.570
ANALOGY IS ESSENTIALLY.

02:05:11.637 --> 02:05:13.706
ASCRIBING TENDENCY TO HOW WE

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:15.374
TREAT CROPS ON THE LAND AND I

02:05:15.441 --> 02:05:17.643
THINK THAT'S I'M GONNA STRUGGLE

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.111
WITH THAT WITH THAT ANALOGY AND

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:20.913
AND I'LL ALSO.

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.581
SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:25.251
SEEKING A SEQUEL HAS BEEN A KIND

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:27.486
OF A WHIPPING BOY WAY FOR LAND

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:28.821
USE ISSUES BUT IF YOU LOOK

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.089
STATISTICALLY.

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:31.590
AT HOUSE EQUITIES USE IT IS

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:34.460
CLEARLY NOT THE PROBLEM THE

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:35.060
BIGGEST PROBLEM WE FACE RIGHT

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.395
NOW.

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:37.796
WITH GETTING MORE HOUSING BUILT.

02:05:37.863 --> 02:05:38.831
IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:40.165
AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE COMMERCIAL

02:05:40.232 --> 02:05:41.166
DEVELOPMENT THE COMMERCIAL

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:42.568
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:44.036
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THERE'S

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:45.938
BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.706
ECONOMIC STUDIES THAT THAT ARE

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:49.508
THAT ARE SHOWING THIS RIGHT NOW.

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:50.976
THAT THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS

02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.678
AND GIVEN THE TERRACE ON STEEL

02:05:52.745 --> 02:05:54.046
ON THE TERRACE ON CONCRETE AND

02:05:54.113 --> 02:05:56.282
THE LACK OF A WORK FORCE TO

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:58.217
PROVIDE. TO IT TO BE BUILDING

02:05:58.284 --> 02:06:00.386
THOSE ARE GOING TO THE PLACES

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:02.154
THAT CAN AFFORD TO THE PROJECTS

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:03.956
HE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE HIGHEST

02:06:04.023 --> 02:06:05.291
COST OF CONSTRUCTION.

02:06:05.357 --> 02:06:06.025
AND THAT'S THESE LARGE

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.893
COMMERCIAL PROJECTS WHICH BY THE

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.628
WAY ARE NOT CARING THEIR SHARE

02:06:09.695 --> 02:06:13.098
OF PROPERTY TAX BURDEN. TO TO

02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:15.067
REALLY FUN THE LEVEL OF SERVICES

02:06:15.134 --> 02:06:15.701
AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.236
OUR COMMUNITY.

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.304
THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN

02:06:18.370 --> 02:06:19.872
CALIFORNIA IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:21.540
CURRENT STUDIES THAT ARE SHOWING

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:22.741
WHAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:24.209
NOT HAPPEN WITH RESPECT TO

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:25.077
DEVELOPMENT.

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:26.345
DON'T EVEN MENTION THE

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:27.780
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT SO

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:30.015
FAR DOWN THE THE LIST WHEN THE

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:32.084
CURRENT ECONOMIC PRESSURES THAT

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.886
ARE DRIVING THE KINDS OF

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.120
PROJECTS WHERE ALL OF THOSE

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:36.755
RESOURCES ARE GOING.

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.590
IT'S NOT GOING TO HOUSING SO

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:40.459
EVEN IF WE ARE.

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.527
PUSHING TO BUILD HOUSING ACROSS

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:47.032
RESOURCES GOING INTO THAT THE

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:48.467

COMMERCIAL SIDE A LOT OF THE

02:06:49.969 --> 02:06:50.803
MEGA CAMPUSES THAT ARE HAPPENING

02:06:50.869 --> 02:06:52.671
AND AND LARGE DEVELOPMENTS THAT

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:55.007
ARE GOING ON SO IN HE MEANTIME.

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.075
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE TENDENCY

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.443
IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE EXISTING

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.478
HOUSING STOCK AND PROTECTING THE

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:01.613

THE CAPS ON RENSE RENT CONTROL

02:07:15.894 --> 02:07:17.696
HOWEVER THEY GETS FRAMED AND

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:19.598
PROTECTION OF TENDENCIES AS

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:21.200
GOING HAND IN HAND AND THEY

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.234
OFTEN DON'T LIKE ONE OR THE

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:23.335
OTHER BUT THEY CERTAINLY

UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CANNOT WE

02:07:25.537 --> 02:07:26.638
CANNOT HAVE A SYSTEM OF

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:27.806
PROTECTING TENDENCIES UNLESS WE

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:28.440
HAVE.

02:07:28.507 --> 02:07:29.975
THE BREADTH OF CONTROLS THAT ARE

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:31.377

GRAYSON'S BILL IS TALKING ABOUT

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:36.915
IN THAT AND THAT'S GOING TO COME

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:37.950
UP NEXT.

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:38.917
SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT

ARE IN HOUSING NOW SO THAT

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:47.993
THEY'RE NOT LOSING HOUSING THAT

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.528
THEY'RE HAVING STABLE AND SECURE

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:50.396
HOUSING.

02:07:50.462 --> 02:07:53.198
AS WE THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:54.800
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE HOUSING

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.535
ACTUALLY BUILT WE HAVE PROBLEMS

02:07:56.602 --> 02:07:57.936
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL GETTING

02:07:58.003 --> 02:07:59.638
PROJECTS ENTITLED WE'VE GOT

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:00.939
ZONING CHALLENGES THAT'S WHAT

02:08:01.006 --> 02:08:02.307
THIS LEGISLATURE IS WORKING ON

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:04.243
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:05.911
EVEN IF THOSE HAPPEN.

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:07.479
THE HOUSING PROJECTS SPECIALLY

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:09.048
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS JUST

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:11.283
REALLY CANNOT GET BUILT UNTIL

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.885
THE LABOR SUPPLY THE MATERIAL

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:14.887
SUPPLY TURNS AROUND AND THAT

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.588
SITUATION CHANGES OTHERWISE ALL

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:18.290
THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO.

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.992
TO COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.193

THIS COMMITTEE.

02:08:33.839 --> 02:08:34.473
I'M NOT MAKING THE

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.941
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE COMBINE

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:37.142
THE TWO BILLS BUT I KNOW THAT

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:38.510

THE FLOOR.

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:45.384
GETS TO THE OTHER HOUSE THAT

02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:47.419
WE'RE MOVING A VEHICLE THAT

02:08:47.486 --> 02:08:49.088
EVERYONE CAN FOCUS ON AND MAKE

02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:50.456
SURE THAT WE TRY TO GET IT

02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:52.091
PASSED WITHIN.

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.959
THE THE PURVIEW OF THE

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:57.896
LEGISLATURE SO WITH THAT THE

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:59.264
SPONSOR YOU MAY CLOSE.

I ARE DEFINITELY TALKING WE HOPE

02:09:05.838 --> 02:09:07.339
TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT.

02:09:07.406 --> 02:09:09.007
ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR ONE BILL

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.542
THAT OUR COLLEAGUES WELL AFTER

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.077
COLLEGE TO VOTE ON WE DON'T WANT

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:14.480
TO HAVE ANY CONFUSION OR

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.448
CONSTERNATION ABOUT THE TWO

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:17.950
BILLS AND SO WERE GETTING THOSE

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:19.318
CONVERSATIONS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO

02:09:19.384 --> 02:09:21.453
GET THERE FOR THIS COMMITTEE --

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.554
BUT WE HOPE TO GET THERE AND OUR

02:09:22.621 --> 02:09:23.989
GOAL IS TO GET THERE BY THE TIME

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:24.556
WITH THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IT

02:09:24.623 --> 02:09:27.359
SHOULD IT SHOULD OUR BILLS GET

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.094
OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:29.695
I WANT TO JUST A COUPLE QUICK

02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:31.396
ITEMS THAT WERE MADE IN

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:34.933
OPPOSITION AND ABBOTT AS I CLOSE

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:35.400
ONE IS.

02:09:35.467 --> 02:09:36.635
IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE IN

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:38.370
OPPOSITION THAT DISCRIMINATION

02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:40.372
AND RETALIATION ALREADY ILLEGAL --

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:42.774
THAT'S TRUE.

02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:44.143
BUT IS ALSO A LOOPHOLE THAT YOU

02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:45.043
COULD DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH.

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:47.613
AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT THE

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:49.715
LANDLORD NEED NOT STATED REASON

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:50.983
FOR AFFECTION IT'S JUST A NOTICE

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:51.984
OF AFFECTION.

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.318
AND SO WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT CAN

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:54.753
BE FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.121
AT ALL IT COULD BE FOR AN

02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:57.122
ARBITRARY REASON IT COULD BE FOR

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:58.290
DISCRIMINATORY REASON IT COULD

02:09:58.357 --> 02:09:59.758
BE FOR RETALIATORY THAT WE DON'T

02:09:59.825 --> 02:10:00.526
KNOW.

02:10:00.592 --> 02:10:02.728
BECAUSE IT'S A BLACK BOX IT'S A

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:04.196
MYSTERY TO QUESTION MARK.

02:10:04.263 --> 02:10:06.632
IT'S NOT BEEN ARTICULATED BY

02:10:06.698 --> 02:10:07.466
HAVING THIS ADDED.

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:09.701
LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE OF

02:10:09.768 --> 02:10:11.003
TRANSPARENCY OF OPENNESS ABOUT

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:13.071
WHAT THAT ARTICULATED REASON IS

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.907
FOR THE EVICTION WE PROVIDE MORE

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.575
PROTECTIONS -- TO OUR TENANTS

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.544
WHO ARE IN A STATE OF CRISIS

02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:20.412
THROUGHOUT -- THE STATE OF

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:21.780
CALIFORNIA.

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.282
WE ALSO HEARD IN OPPOSITION THAT

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.150
INCREASE RENT IS IS THE POSSIBLE

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:28.053
OUTCOME OF THIS JUST BECAUSE

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:28.587

THAT MAY BE.

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:31.957
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED.

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:33.458
MR CHOOSE BILL THEY GO HAND IN

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.227

NEED BOTH.

02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:39.464
AND SO -- WHERE WHERE WHERE THAT

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.832
POTENTIAL IF JUST BECAUSE MOVED

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:42.634

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:51.810
THE FACT THAT WITH JUST BECAUSE

AND A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:03.055
WITNESSES AT TRIAL.

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:06.191
AND BEING IN FRONT OF A JUDGE IN

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:09.161
IN IN A TRIAL.

02:11:09.228 --> 02:11:10.162
THE FACT OF THE MATTER THAT

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:11.597
TENANTS RARELY HAVE THE LEGAL

02:11:11.663 --> 02:11:13.065
REPRESENTATION TO GO TO A

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.433
CONTESTED TRIAL.

02:11:14.499 --> 02:11:16.702
AND THAT THE VACATIONS ARE NOT

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:18.770
RESOLVED AT TRIAL.

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:19.938
MANY TENANTS WERE THEY RECEIVE

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:21.840
AN EVICTION NOTICE.

02:11:21.907 --> 02:11:24.276
COMPLY AND VACATE.

02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:27.479
IF A IF LITIGATION.

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:28.080
AND LEGAL ACTION MUST BE TAKEN

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:28.380
[inaudible]

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:32.117
THEN.

02:11:32.184 --> 02:11:33.318
I IT'S USUALLY IT'S TO A

02:11:33.385 --> 02:11:34.419
DETAINER ACTION.

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.255
AND BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.457
REPRESENTATION TENANTS 40% OF

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:39.458
THE TIME.

02:11:39.524 --> 02:11:40.459
THIS IS RIGHT OUT OF THE

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:44.229
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- LOSE THEIR

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:44.796
IT UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE BY

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:46.932
DEFAULT.

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.600
SO YOU DON'T DON'T IN A TRIAL

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:50.836
DON'T IN FRONT OF QUARTERS NORTH

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:53.705
WITNESS BEING ASKED TO TESTIFY --

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.040
WHEN A TENET DOESN'T?

02:11:55.107 --> 02:11:56.241
VACATE AFTER RECEIVING AN

02:11:56.308 --> 02:11:57.843
EVICTION NOTICE OR DOESN'T LOSE

02:11:57.909 --> 02:12:00.812
UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE BY --

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:03.181
DEFAULT OFTENTIMES THEY LOSE BY

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.549
MISS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:06.051
AND ONLY IN VERY FEW CASES DO WE

02:12:06.118 --> 02:12:08.120
GO TO COURT FOR A CONTEST TO

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:10.055
TRIAL SO SO LET'S NOT.

02:12:10.122 --> 02:12:12.991
USE -- THE EXCEPTION.

02:12:13.058 --> 02:12:14.293
AND TURN THAT INTO THE BIGGEST

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:15.527
ARGUMENT AGAINST US BECAUSE

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:16.094
BECAUSE IT BECAUSE IT REALLY

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:17.262
HAPPENS AND FRANKLY NO IT WAS

02:12:17.329 --> 02:12:18.864

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.599
TENANTS WITH QUOTE TREMENDOUS

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:22.401
BAD BEHAVIOR.

WHO WE CANNOT -- AFFECT IF IT'S

02:12:25.203 --> 02:12:26.538
TREMENDOUS BAD BEHAVIOR.

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:27.205
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:29.207
SUBSTANTIATE THAT QUITE EASILY.

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:33.178
I IN YOUR IN YOUR FILINGS WITH

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:33.745

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:34.313
TRIAL.

02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:34.946
SO.

02:12:35.013 --> 02:12:36.581
I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE THIS

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:39.718
BILL IS NOT. TO TO PROTECT

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:42.454
TENANTS WHO THAT FROM THERE

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:42.954

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:44.256
ADDICTION -- WHEN IT'S FAIR AND

02:12:44.323 --> 02:12:46.525

ARBITRARY?

02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:52.464
WHEN IT'S RETALIATE FOR WHEN

02:12:52.531 --> 02:12:53.065
IT'S DISCRIMINATORY THEY OUGHT

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:54.933
NOT BE -- WE ALSO HAD AT SOME

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.868
DISCUSSION ABOUT ABOUT PRIVATE

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:58.370
PROPERTY RIGHTS.

02:12:58.437 --> 02:12:59.971
YOU KNOW THIS JUST BECAUSE

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:03.275
THERE'S NOT.

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:05.344
ENOUGH FLIP THE POWER DYNAMIC

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:06.878

02:13:10.148 --> 02:13:10.982
IT.

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.250
DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO EVEN

02:13:12.317 --> 02:13:13.885
IN THE SCALES.

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:15.921
THIS IS A MODICUM AFFAIR MODICUM

02:13:15.987 --> 02:13:18.657
OF PROTECTION. FOR TENANTS

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.359
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO ARE IN

02:13:20.425 --> 02:13:21.960
A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

02:13:22.027 --> 02:13:23.428
IT'S A POWER RELATIONSHIP THAT

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:25.030
VERY MUCH FAVORS LANDLORDS AND

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.264
WILL CONTINUE.

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:28.233
TO BUT IT PROVIDES A EIGHT A

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.068
LEVEL OF OF DECENT DIGNIFIED

02:13:30.135 --> 02:13:33.839
PROTECTION. FOR TENANTS --

02:13:33.905 --> 02:13:34.773
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND YOU

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.640
KNOW.

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.042
I APPRECIATE MY MY COLLEAGUE'S

02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:40.479
COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT -- HE

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:41.980
WRITES A YOU KNOW.

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:43.148
I I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

02:13:43.215 --> 02:13:44.349
I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:45.117
APPROACH WHERE YOU'RE COMING

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:45.951
FROM.

02:13:46.017 --> 02:13:47.219
I THINK SOME OF THAT THOUGH IS

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:49.955
IN MY VIEW IS IS IS.

02:13:50.021 --> 02:13:51.456
A CONCEPT AND THEORY THAT'S NOT

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:53.058
PLAYING OUT ON THE GROUND WE WE

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.126
ONLY NEED LOOK AT THE OUTCOME SO

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:55.827
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:59.331
HAPPENING IS NOT WORKING -- AND

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:00.866
OUR JOB HERE IS TO PROVIDE A

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:02.300
PUBLIC POLICY THAT PROTECTS ALL

02:14:02.367 --> 02:14:06.438
OF US -- NOT JUST PROPERTY

02:14:06.505 --> 02:14:08.573
OWNERS NOT JUST LANDLORDS -- BUT

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:09.641
EVERYONE INCLUDING OUR TO OUR

02:14:09.708 --> 02:14:11.076
TENANTS WHO ARE BEING HURT.

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:12.310
A LOT RIGHT NOW.

02:14:12.377 --> 02:14:13.378
AND I WANT TO CLEAR BUT ONE ITEM

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:15.213
THERE WAS A POINT MADE THAT

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.481
BECAUSE OF JUST BECAUSE THE

02:14:16.548 --> 02:14:18.283
LANDLORD WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.584
BE.

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:20.986
I THINK THE WORD WAS USED A SLUM

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:23.155
LORDS OR OR TO NOT UP KEEPER

02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:24.890
MAINTAIN THEIR PROMISES. TO BE

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.057
CLEAR THAT OUT WE HAVE

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:28.493
ARTICULATED NO FALL JUST CAUSES

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.295
ONE OF IT IS UNSAFE HABITATION.

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:32.297
OR SUBSTANTIAL REMODEL.

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:35.734
SO LANDLORDS CAN EVICT OF AS A

02:14:35.801 --> 02:14:37.169
NO FAULT JUST BECAUSE A TENANT

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.804
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT UPKEEP AND

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:39.771
MAINTENANCE.

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:41.473
OTHER PROPERTIES THAT'S THAT'S

02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:43.141
NECESSARY.

02:14:43.208 --> 02:14:44.209
SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO END BY

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:45.143
SAYING THIS.

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:47.512
WE'RE NOT TALKING TODAY ABOUT A

HAVE HEARD.

02:18:02.774 --> 02:18:04.209
IN MY COMMUNITY AND WHY I FEEL

02:18:04.275 --> 02:18:05.610
IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MORAL

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:07.412
IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS JUST CAUSE

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.747
INFECTION.

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:10.649
I BECAME INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE

02:18:10.715 --> 02:18:12.150
THROUGH A FAMILY IN CONCORD.

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.618
THEY CAME TO ME TO ASK WHAT THEY

02:18:13.685 --> 02:18:14.819
SHOULD DO WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN A

02:18:14.886 --> 02:18:16.388
NOTICE TO VACATE THEIR PROPERTY

02:18:16.454 --> 02:18:18.023
WITHOUT CAUSE.

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.691
THIS FAMILY INCLUDED SENIORS AND

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:22.060
A MEMBER ON LONG TERM DISABILITY.

02:18:22.127 --> 02:18:23.428
THEIR APARTMENT WAS CLEAN AND

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:25.563
WELL KEPT THEY PAID THE RENT ON

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:28.400
TIME THEY WERE GOOD TENANTS.

02:18:28.466 --> 02:18:29.634
THEY ASKED ME WHAT THEY SHOULD

02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:31.102
DO SHOULD THEY STAY IN THE UNIT

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:32.704
AND MAKE THE LAMB OR GO THROUGH

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:34.539
THE FORMALLY FICTION PROCESS.

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.374
AND I TOLD THEM THE RIGHT THING

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:38.076
TO DO WAS TO SIMPLY COMPLY WITH

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.277
THE LAW.

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:40.412
BUT I SAW THE FEAR THE

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:41.846
UNCERTAINTY AFFECTING THIS

02:18:41.913 --> 02:18:43.381
FAMILY THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:44.649
COULD AFFORD TO STAY IN THE SAME

02:18:44.716 --> 02:18:46.484
COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY WHERE

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.619
THEY WORKED WHERE THEIR KIDS

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:48.787
WENT TO SCHOOL.

02:18:48.853 --> 02:18:50.255
WHERE THEY WENT TO CHURCH?

02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:52.123
I REALIZE THAT IT WASN'T THIS

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:54.059
FAMILY WHO SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT

02:18:54.125 --> 02:18:55.894
THE RIGHT THING TO DO WAS BUT

AND THAT IS WHY I DECIDED TO

02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:02.901
CARRY THIS BILL BECAUSE THE HARM

02:19:02.967 --> 02:19:05.270
CAUSED BY THE VISION IS SO GREAT.

02:19:05.336 --> 02:19:06.771
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:08.306
A COMPELLING INTEREST TO

02:19:08.373 --> 02:19:09.507
INTERVENE.

02:19:09.574 --> 02:19:11.042

DISCRIMINATORY EVICTIONS.

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:22.153
WHAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR A

02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.421
LANDLORD TO EVICT SOMEONE

02:19:36.134 --> 02:19:37.802
CAUSE AT ALL.

02:19:37.869 --> 02:19:39.237
IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE A

02:19:39.304 --> 02:19:40.872
SITUATION IN WHICH A LANDLORD

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:43.041
ACTING IN BAD FAITH COULD USE

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:44.375

02:20:01.659 --> 02:20:04.229
RIGHTS IN THEIR LEASE DOCUMENT.

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:05.530
RECOGNIZING THAT A HEALTHY

HAS OCCUPIED A RENTAL UNIT FOR

02:20:26.084 --> 02:20:27.719
AT LEAST TEN MONTHS.

02:20:27.786 --> 02:20:29.254
I UNDERSTAND THAT LANDLORD

JUST LIKE UNDER EXISTING LAW.

02:20:47.438 --> 02:20:49.107
THIS MEANS THAT THE RENTERS

ESSENTIAL PART OF A PACKAGE THAT

PROVIDES PROTECTION TO RENTERS

02:23:40.878 --> 02:23:42.413
WHILE ALLOWING BUSINESS OWNERS

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.514
LIKE MYSELF TO OPERATE

02:23:43.581 --> 02:23:44.716
SUCCESSFULLY.

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.751

ON PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:24:19.484 --> 02:24:21.319
IT GIVES TIME TO VET THE TENANT

02:24:21.386 --> 02:24:22.620

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:25.223
THIS BILL THAT CURRENTLY IS NOT

02:24:25.289 --> 02:24:25.890
REFLECTED AS MUCH IN THE BOND TO

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:28.326

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:33.664
IN THE BUILDING.

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:35.600
IT ALLOWS CUSTOMARY JUST BECAUSE

THINGS THAT ALLOW ONE OWNER TO

CONDUCT THEIR BUSINESS -- AND IT

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:43.241
PROVIDES RELOCATION ASSISTANCE

02:24:43.307 --> 02:24:45.109
WHEN A TENANT IS AFFECTED FOR NO

02:24:45.176 --> 02:24:46.978
FAULT FOR AN OWNER BUSINESS

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:49.080

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:54.919

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:57.121
OREGON LAW WHICH DOES INCLUDE

SO THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATION I

02:25:04.729 --> 02:25:05.196
THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.230
ACKNOWLEDGE SHOULD CONTINUE.

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:08.066

I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE

02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:47.591
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE THE

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:49.360

MY NAME IS DR KELLY NIGHT AND

I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:23.661
MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AT THE

02:33:23.727 --> 02:33:25.296
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN

02:33:25.362 --> 02:33:26.230

02:33:26.297 --> 02:33:26.964
I'M IN AN I. H. FUNDED

RESEARCHER WITH OVER TWO DECADES

02:33:28.732 --> 02:33:30.034
OF EXPERIENCE RESEARCHING

02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:31.101
HOMELESSNESS.

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:32.703
MY REMARKS TODAY REFLECT THE

02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:34.305
WORK THAT MYSELF AND DOCTOR

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:35.839
MARGOT WHO SHALL PROFESSOR OF

02:33:35.906 --> 02:33:36.974
MEDICINE AND LEADING RESEARCHER

02:33:37.041 --> 02:33:38.475
ON HOMELESSNESS HAVE CONDUCTED

02:33:38.542 --> 02:33:39.410
TOGETHER.

02:33:39.476 --> 02:33:40.744
ON THE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:44.348
SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS IN

02:33:44.415 --> 02:33:44.848
OLDER ADULTS.

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:45.816
IN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.952
AMONG THE HOMELESS ADULTS AGED

02:33:48.018 --> 02:33:50.020
FIFTY AND OLDER 29% HAD STAYED

02:33:50.087 --> 02:33:51.689
OVERNIGHT WITH A FAMILY OR

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.324
FRIEND IN THE PRIOR SIX MONTHS.

02:33:53.390 --> 02:33:55.359
AND 9% REPORTED MOVING IN WITH

02:33:55.426 --> 02:33:57.227
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WE WERE

02:33:57.294 --> 02:33:59.163
SURPRISED TO LEARN HOW COMMON IT

02:33:59.229 --> 02:34:00.731
WAS FOR PERSONS EXPERIENCING

02:34:00.798 --> 02:34:02.166
HOMELESSNESS TO STAY WITH FAMILY

02:34:02.232 --> 02:34:03.734
OR FRIENDS FOR A SHORT WHILE.

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:05.502
AND THEN RETURNED TO THE SHELTER

02:34:05.569 --> 02:34:06.704
ON THE STREETS.

02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:08.038
AND WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING AN H.

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:10.074
FUNDED RESEARCHERS RESEARCH TO

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:12.009
INCREASE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:13.811
BASED TO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE.

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:15.279
WE FOUND THAT FAMILIES AND CLOSE

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:16.747
FRIENDS ARE FOR MANY PEOPLE

02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:18.282
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AN

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:21.018
ONGOING SOURCE OF SUPPORT BOTH

02:34:21.085 --> 02:34:22.186
EMOTIONALLY AND MATERIALLY.

02:34:22.252 --> 02:34:23.320
WHILE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE

02:34:23.387 --> 02:34:24.622
WILLING TO TAKE IN THEIR LOVED

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:26.156
ONES THEY FACE MANY BARRIERS IN

02:34:26.223 --> 02:34:28.258
DOING SO. ONE COMMON REASON THAT

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:29.593
HOMELESS OLDER ADULTS DID NOT

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:31.095
STAY LONG TERM WITH FAMILY AND

02:34:31.161 --> 02:34:32.463
FRIENDS WAS DUE TO THE HOUSE

02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:34.765
FAMILY MEMBERS FEAR OF VIOLATING

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:36.367
THEIR LEASE BY HAVING A NON

02:34:36.433 --> 02:34:38.035
LEASEHOLDER STAY WITH THEM.

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.670
THIS FEAR OF CAUSING ADDICTION

02:34:39.737 --> 02:34:40.704
CAME UP IN OUR INTERVIEWS WITH

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:42.406
HOMELESS ADULTS WOULD STAY WITH

02:34:42.473 --> 02:34:43.774
FAMILY MEMBERS BUT THEN LEFT.

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:45.042
SUCH AS THIS OLDER MAN WHO

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:46.644
STAYED ONLY TEMPORARILY WITH HIS

02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:47.578
SISTER.

02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:49.513
HE SAID I DON'T STAY THERE WITH

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.248
MY SISTER OF COURSE NOT SHE

02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:52.583
WOULD BE AFFECTED IF THEY LACK

02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:53.851
OF THE LANDLORD KNEW SO

02:34:53.917 --> 02:34:56.787
OFFICIALLY I DON'T STAY THERE

02:34:56.854 --> 02:34:57.688
BECAUSE I'M NOT ON THE LEASE.

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:58.489
WE ALSO HEARD THIS FROM FAMILY

02:34:58.555 --> 02:35:00.557
MEMBERS AS WELL WHO EXPRESSED

02:35:00.624 --> 02:35:02.693
CONCERN THAT HOSTING A ABOUT

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:04.561
HOSTING A HOMELESS FAMILY MEMBER.

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:05.596
ONE WOMAN WE INTERVIEWED WANTED

02:35:05.663 --> 02:35:07.031
TO BE ABLE TO OFFER HER BROTHER

02:35:07.097 --> 02:35:08.766
A PLACE TO STAY AFTER HE HAD

02:35:08.832 --> 02:35:09.733
WITNESSED A SHOOTING WHILE

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:10.834
LIVING ON THE STREET AND WAS

02:35:10.901 --> 02:35:12.336
TRAUMATIZED.

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:13.270
BUT SHE FEARED THAT THE FOR

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:15.205
LANDLORD KNEW ABOUT HER BROTHER

02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:16.473
STAY SHE WOULD LOSE HER HOUSING.

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:17.775
WE FOUND THAT STAYING WITH

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:19.376
FAMILY AND FRIENDS BOUGHT ALSO

02:35:19.443 --> 02:35:20.611
BROUGHT BENEFITS BEYOND JUST

02:35:20.678 --> 02:35:21.979
PROVIDING RESPITE.

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:23.814
FROM SHELTER OR THE STREETS FOR

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:25.115
FAMILY MEMBERS OFTEN PROVIDED

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.784
NEEDED ASSISTANCE SUCH AS

02:35:26.850 --> 02:35:27.951
GETTING HELP TO MEDICAL

02:35:28.018 --> 02:35:29.153
APPOINTMENTS GETTING HELP

02:35:29.219 --> 02:35:30.587
GETTING PAPERWORK IN ORDER

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.756
MANAGING MONEY AND HELP FIGHT

02:35:32.823 --> 02:35:34.391
FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING.

02:35:34.458 --> 02:35:35.459
HOMELESS ADULTS WHO STAYED WITH

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:37.728
FAMILY VIEW THIS OPTION A SAFER

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:39.563
AND MORE DIGNIFIED THAN STAYING

02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:41.265
IN SHELTERS OR ON THE STREET BUT

02:35:41.331 --> 02:35:42.833
THEY ALSO SOUGHT.

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:44.935
A LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING SO

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.270
THEY SAW IT AS AN EXIT AWAY TO

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:47.738
EXIT HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY

02:35:47.805 --> 02:35:50.074
REGROUP SAVE THE RESOURCES AND

02:50:46.636 --> 02:50:47.437
TWELVE EIGHTY SIX I WAS IN SAN

02:50:47.503 --> 02:50:49.272
DIEGO IN OCTOBER AFTER

02:50:49.339 --> 02:50:50.807
COMPLETING A THREE HUNDRED MILE

02:50:50.873 --> 02:50:52.976
BIKE RIDE FROM SANTA BARBARA IN

02:50:53.042 --> 02:50:54.711
SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA

BICYCLE COALITION.

02:50:56.746 --> 02:50:58.548
AFTER THE RIDE I DECIDED TO

02:50:58.615 --> 02:51:00.416
REMAIN IN SAN DIEGO FOR A FEW

02:51:00.483 --> 02:51:02.652
DAYS.

02:51:02.719 --> 02:51:05.254
AND VISIT THE NAVAL BASES I AM A

02:51:05.321 --> 02:51:08.358
RETIRED NAVAL VETERAN.

02:51:08.424 --> 02:51:09.492
I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE TROLLEY

02:51:09.559 --> 02:51:12.729
TO THE BASE.

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:14.097
BUT I LEARNED IT WAS QUITE A

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:17.600
DISTANCE TO WALK SO I DECIDED.

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:19.135
TO RENT TO SCOOTER.

02:51:19.202 --> 02:51:20.970
I'D BEEN ON TO THE PREVIOUS DAY

02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:22.905
SO I WASN'T.

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:24.207
I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE USE AND

02:51:24.273 --> 02:51:27.310
THEY WERE ALL.

02:51:27.377 --> 02:51:29.846
ROB -- THEY WERE ALL -- BIRD

02:51:29.912 --> 02:51:33.449
SCOOTERS.

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:34.751
WHEN I WAS ON THE SCOOTER I

02:51:34.817 --> 02:51:36.552
DECIDED THAT I I WAS DESCENDING

02:51:36.619 --> 02:51:39.022
A HILL WHICH BECAME QUITE STURDY?

02:51:39.088 --> 02:51:40.990
WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES THEY

02:51:41.057 --> 02:51:42.659
FAILED?

02:51:42.725 --> 02:51:44.494
IMMEDIATELY I ASK MYSELF WHAT

02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:46.629
SHOULD I DO NOW -- WHAT THING

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.731
THAT CAME TO MIND WAS?

02:51:48.798 --> 02:51:50.500
STARING INTO A DRIVEWAY.

02:51:50.566 --> 02:51:52.368
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN ONE OF

02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:54.137
THE NEIGHBORS YARDS AND HOPING I

02:51:54.203 --> 02:51:56.239
CAN GO OVER THE RETAINING WALL

02:51:56.305 --> 02:51:57.573
THE EDGE OF THEIR PROPERTY.

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.941
A SECOND THOUGHT WAS TO GO TO

02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:01.811
THE BOTTOM AND TURNED SHARPLY UP

02:52:01.878 --> 02:52:03.713
THE ROAD THAT SEEM TO BE IN

02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:05.948
ASCENDING.

02:52:06.015 --> 02:52:07.483
ONE I REMEMBER NOTHING AFTER

02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:11.387
THAT -- FRIGHT BLACKED OUT AND

02:52:11.454 --> 02:52:12.989
DIDN'T WAKE UP UNTIL I WAS IN

02:52:13.056 --> 02:52:19.162
THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT UCSD --

02:52:19.228 --> 02:52:21.564
AND I HAD A HELMET ON AND I HAVE

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:25.068
A HELMET ON DOCTOR WAS TALKING

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:27.370
TO ME AND AND DESCRIBING BYE.

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:29.439
BYE INJURIES [inaudible]

02:52:29.505 --> 02:52:32.909
AND THEN ASKED ME.

02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:34.610
IF I WAS WILLING TO LET THEM

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:36.379
BRING ME -- TO ARE.

02:52:36.446 --> 02:52:38.214
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:40.249
TOO PAINFUL TO KNOWN TO HAVE ALL

02:52:40.316 --> 02:52:42.218
MY WOUNDS CLEAN [inaudible]

02:52:42.285 --> 02:52:47.824
KNEES ELBOWS BACKS OF BOTH HANDS.

02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:49.759
SO I SAID OKAY.

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:51.494
IF YOU MUST.

02:52:51.561 --> 02:52:52.795
WOULD YOU AGREE TO DONATE YOUR

02:52:52.862 --> 02:52:54.964
ORGANS IF WE IF YOU DON'T COME

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:58.935
OUT OF IT AS THAT WAS A REALITY

02:52:59.001 --> 02:53:00.169
CHECK IT SAID.

02:53:00.236 --> 02:53:02.238
CERTAINLY BUT I HOPE I DO MAKE

02:53:02.305 --> 02:53:04.640
IT MAKE IT FROM THE OPERATING

02:53:04.707 --> 02:53:09.612
ROOM -- I ALSO HAD TO HAVE

02:53:09.679 --> 02:53:11.447
STITCHES ON MY LEFT HANDED AND

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:13.583
MY RIGHT ELBOW.

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:15.518
BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- I I HAD A

02:53:15.585 --> 02:53:18.454
HELMET ON SO -- I SURVIVED THE

02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:21.824
INCIDENT I NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE

02:53:21.891 --> 02:53:24.694
HAD I NOT HAD THE HELMET ON I

02:53:24.761 --> 02:53:26.095
WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR TWO AND

02:53:26.162 --> 02:53:28.197
A HALF DAYS AND STILL HAVE SOME

02:53:28.264 --> 02:53:31.033
RECURRING -- DISCOMFORT IN IN MY

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:32.435
HANDS IN THE ELBOW.

02:53:32.502 --> 02:53:36.506
AND SOME COGNITIVE ISSUES.

02:53:36.572 --> 02:53:39.075
ESCHOOL NEWS MAY PROVIDE AN

02:53:39.142 --> 02:53:41.110
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:42.445
OPTIONS.

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:44.714
BUT THEY NEED TO BE YOU WELL

02:53:44.781 --> 02:53:46.115
MAINTAINS.

02:53:46.182 --> 02:53:47.450
SO THAT THOSE THAT RIDE UPON

02:53:47.517 --> 02:53:49.352
THEM.

02:53:49.418 --> 02:53:52.688
CAN BE SAFE.

02:53:52.755 --> 02:53:54.223
RIGHT NOW THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO

02:53:54.290 --> 02:53:55.525
BE ANY RECOURSE AGAINST THESE

02:53:55.591 --> 02:53:57.794
COMPANIES.

02:53:57.860 --> 02:54:00.396
IMAGINE YOURSELF RENTING A CAR

02:54:00.463 --> 02:54:02.165
ONLY TO FIND THAT.

02:54:02.231 --> 02:54:03.733
THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK WHEN YOU

02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:06.402
WERE DESCENDING A HILL.

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:08.971
AND YOU HIT A WALL -- WORSE A

02:54:09.038 --> 02:54:11.507
CHILD -- BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T

02:54:11.574 --> 02:54:12.909
STOP THE VEHICLE.

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:16.379
YOU HAVE SOME RECOURSE AGAINST.

02:54:16.445 --> 02:54:17.947
CAR RENTAL AGENCY OR THE CAR

02:54:18.014 --> 02:54:20.116
MANUFACTURER.

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:22.418
BUT IT'S THE SCOOTER COMPANIES

02:54:22.485 --> 02:54:24.887
DON'T SEEM LIABLE FOR ANYTHING

02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:25.922
RIGHT NOW.

02:54:25.988 --> 02:54:28.958
THAT HARDLY SEEMS FAIR.

02:54:29.025 --> 02:54:30.493
THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION I

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:31.961
BELIEVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:54:32.028 --> 02:54:34.230
MINIMUM SAFETY AND INSURANCE

02:54:34.297 --> 02:54:37.533

ANY REGULATIONS OR ANY

02:55:13.436 --> 02:55:14.737
PERMISSION ADVENT SAW.

02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:16.906
AS A RESULT WE'RE SEEING A RISE

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:18.908
IN INJURIES THAT ARE HAPPENING

02:55:18.975 --> 02:55:20.543

SUCH AS THE INSURANCE MAKE SURE

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:26.349
THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:55:26.415 --> 02:55:27.783
PROVIDING THESE SCOOTERS ARE

02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:30.219
COMPANIES THAT HAVE SOME SOLID

02:55:30.286 --> 02:55:31.687
FOUNDATION TO THEM AND CAN BE.

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:34.390
IN A POSITION TO PAY FOR ANY

02:55:34.457 --> 02:55:35.625
HARMS THAT THEY CAUSE.

02:55:35.691 --> 02:55:37.593
ADDITIONALLY IT PROVIDES THE

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.562
OPPORTUNITY FOR REGULATION BY

02:55:39.629 --> 02:55:41.097
THE LOCAL CITIES AND GOVERNMENTS

02:55:41.163 --> 02:55:42.665
AND AND REQUIRES THEM TO PUT

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:44.634
FORTH THESE REGULATIONS SO THAT

02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:46.202
THERE IS SOME FORM.

02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:48.938
OF REGULATION OVER THESE DEVICES

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:50.773
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE WILD WEST.

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:51.674
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:53.109
PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND I

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:54.610
KNOW ONE OF THE ONES IT'S MOST

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.846
CUT THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL.

02:55:56.913 --> 02:55:57.380
IS THE RELEASE AND WAIVER

02:55:57.446 --> 02:55:58.581
LANGUAGE.

02:55:58.648 --> 02:56:00.850
AND I WANT. TO DISCUSS WITH THE

02:56:00.917 --> 02:56:02.351
COMMITTEE WHY THIS IS SO

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:03.152
IMPORTANT.

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:05.755
SO WITH SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS

02:56:05.821 --> 02:56:07.490
THAT ARE IN THESE PROVIDERS

02:56:07.556 --> 02:56:09.058
CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS

ON ANY DAMAGES THAT ARE CAUSED

02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:15.731
BY THE PROVIDERS -- NEGLIGENCE

02:56:15.798 --> 02:56:18.167
FOR THE PROVISION OF THE FAULTY

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:19.902
DEVICE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN IT.

02:56:19.969 --> 02:56:21.837
IN ANOTHER ASPECT IS THAT THEY

02:56:21.904 --> 02:56:22.805
CHANGE THE STATUTE OF

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:24.707
LIMITATIONS TO REDUCE IT SO THAT

02:56:24.774 --> 02:56:26.475
AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT HAVE ANY

02:56:26.542 --> 02:56:28.210
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY NEED TO

02:56:28.277 --> 02:56:29.378
FIND A LAWYER.

02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:30.913
AND THE INVESTIGATING PROSECUTOR

02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:32.014
CLAIM.

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:33.482
NOW THESE ARE SUBSTANTIAL

02:56:33.549 --> 02:56:34.917
ALTERATIONS IN THE RIGHTS OF

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:36.352
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE ON

02:56:36.419 --> 02:56:38.220
AWARE OF BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW

02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:39.655
CLICKING ACCEPT.

02:56:39.722 --> 02:56:41.657
IS A WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST

02:56:41.724 --> 02:56:43.326
GETTING ACCESS WITHOUT FULLY

02:56:43.392 --> 02:56:44.961
KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

02:56:45.027 --> 02:56:47.663
IN THE RELEASE IN WAIVER THAT

02:56:47.730 --> 02:56:49.098
THEY'RE PROVIDING.

02:56:49.165 --> 02:56:50.266
SO WHAT WOULD A RELEASING WAIVER --

02:56:50.333 --> 02:56:51.968
PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM FOR

02:56:52.034 --> 02:56:53.569
THESE COMPANIES.

02:56:53.636 --> 02:56:55.938
WELL BIRD HAS JUST CREATED ITS

02:56:56.005 --> 02:56:57.340
OWN SCOOTER.

02:56:57.406 --> 02:56:59.008
AND NOT ONLY IS IT A PUTTING A

02:56:59.075 --> 02:57:00.409
SCOOTER ON THE STREET BUT IT IS

02:57:00.476 --> 02:57:02.011
DESIGNED IN MANUFACTURING THE

02:57:02.078 --> 02:57:03.179
SCOOTER.

02:57:03.245 --> 02:57:04.547
A BIRD IS A COMPANY THAT IS THE

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:06.749
FASTEST COMPANY TO REACH A ONE

02:57:06.816 --> 02:57:08.684
BILLION DOLLAR VALUATION.

02:57:08.751 --> 02:57:10.953
IT'S REAL IT'S RAISED OVER NINE

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:11.887
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.389
VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDS AND IS

02:57:13.456 --> 02:57:15.124
VALUED CURRENTLY AT OVER TWO

02:57:15.191 --> 02:57:16.659
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:57:16.726 --> 02:57:17.994
SO THESE ARE NOT COMPANIES ARE

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:19.762
GONNA BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BY

02:57:19.829 --> 02:57:21.230
COMMON SENSE REGULATION.

02:57:21.297 --> 02:57:22.798
BUT IF THEY'RE SCOOTER IS PUT ON

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:24.200
THE ROAD AND AS WE'VE HEARD THE

02:57:24.266 --> 02:57:25.234
BRAKES FAIL.

02:57:25.301 --> 02:57:26.502
ARE THERE INSTANCES THAT WE'VE

02:57:26.569 --> 02:57:27.870
SEEN OF THE STEERING COLUMN

02:57:27.937 --> 02:57:29.505
COLLAPSING ON THE VEHICLES AND

02:57:29.572 --> 02:57:31.173
EVEN BATTERY FIRES.

02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:33.376
IF THIS THESE WAIVERS AND

02:57:33.442 --> 02:57:35.311
ASSUMPTION OF RISK -- CLAUSES

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:36.512
ARE NOT REMOVED IN THOSE

02:57:36.579 --> 02:57:38.147
COMPANIES WOULD BE COMPLETELY

02:57:38.214 --> 02:57:40.816
IMMUNE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY

02:57:40.883 --> 02:57:42.084
FOR THE DEVICES THAT THEY NOT

02:57:42.151 --> 02:57:43.552
ONLY PUT ON THE STREET.

02:57:43.619 --> 02:57:44.920
BUT THEY ARE DESIGNING AND

02:57:44.987 --> 02:57:46.355
THEY'RE PRODUCING.

02:57:46.422 --> 02:57:48.758
MOREOVER THESE RELEASES EXTEND

02:57:48.824 --> 02:57:50.326
TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS.

02:57:50.393 --> 02:57:52.094
SO WHEN SOMEONE TAKES ONE OF THE

02:57:52.161 --> 02:57:53.696
SCOOTERS OUT THE RELEASE IN

02:57:53.763 --> 02:57:55.297
WAIVER RELEASES IN WAVES THE

02:57:55.364 --> 02:57:56.665
MANUFACTURE.

02:57:56.732 --> 02:57:58.367
OF A SCOOTER IF IT'S NOT THE

02:57:58.434 --> 02:58:00.403
PROVIDER IN AND THAT'S UNHEARD

02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:01.837
OF THAT'S LIKE RENTING A CAR AND

02:58:01.904 --> 02:58:03.305
PROVIDING A RELEASE AND WAIVER

02:58:03.372 --> 02:58:05.908
TO FORD OR GM OR ANOTHER

02:58:05.975 --> 02:58:08.511
CORPORATION IF THEY HAVE A CAR.

02:58:08.577 --> 02:58:11.547
THAT HAS FAULTY BRAKES OR

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:12.448
CATCHES ON FIRE.

02:58:12.515 --> 02:58:14.050
SO THESE ARE REALLY OVER BROAD

02:58:14.116 --> 02:58:15.618
AND THEY PROVIDE A PROTECTION

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:17.119
NOT TO THE CONSUMER BUT A

02:58:17.186 --> 02:58:18.854
PROTECTION THAT ONLY PROTECTS

02:58:18.921 --> 02:58:19.755
THE COMPANIES.

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.690
THAT ARE MAKING CONSIDERABLE

02:58:21.757 --> 02:58:23.259
AMOUNTS OF MONEY OFF OF THESE.

02:58:23.325 --> 02:58:24.860
WHAT ELSE IS IMPORTANT?

02:58:24.927 --> 02:58:27.463
WELL WE HAVE THE JAM ON THE

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:28.798
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

02:58:28.864 --> 02:58:30.599
ASSOCIATION TALKING ABOUT A

02:58:30.666 --> 02:58:32.201
MARKET INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

02:58:32.268 --> 02:58:33.936
INJURIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE USING

02:58:34.003 --> 02:58:35.271
THE SCOOTERS.

02:58:35.337 --> 02:58:36.972
THEY'RE A BAND -- POLLS OF

02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:38.574
EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS SUCH

02:58:38.641 --> 02:58:39.975
AS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT ARE

02:58:40.042 --> 02:58:42.745
TALKING ABOUT HAVING TEN OF

02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:44.113
THESE INJURIES COMING IN A WEEK.

02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:46.449
SO IF WE PROVIDE IN THE M. UNITY

02:58:46.515 --> 02:58:47.683
WHICH IS REALLY WHAT A RELEASE

02:58:47.750 --> 02:58:48.751
AND WAIVER IS TO THESE

02:58:48.818 --> 02:58:50.119
MANUFACTURERS.

02:58:50.186 --> 02:58:52.288
THEN THEN WHO'S GOING TO PICK UP

02:58:52.354 --> 02:58:53.889
THE BILL FOR THESE INJURIES.

02:58:53.956 --> 02:58:55.291
MANY OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

02:58:55.357 --> 02:58:56.725
CANNOT AFFORD A CAR.

02:58:56.792 --> 02:58:58.294
IN SO THEY'RE RIDING A SCOOTER

02:58:58.360 --> 02:58:59.762
AND MANY OF THEM ARE UNINSURED

02:58:59.829 --> 02:59:01.931
SO WHO'S GOING TO PICK THAT UP

02:59:01.997 --> 02:59:03.299
MEDIC COW THE TAXPAYERS.

02:59:03.365 --> 02:59:04.633
IN THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.068
SHOULD BE DOING WHEN YOU HAVE

02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:08.003
COMPANIES THAT ARE VALUED AT

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:09.171
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS [inaudible]

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:11.407
SO.

02:59:11.474 --> 02:59:12.842
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR

02:59:12.908 --> 02:59:14.877
THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE INTO

02:59:14.944 --> 02:59:16.479
ACCOUNT THE ENTIRETY.

02:59:16.545 --> 02:59:17.980
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OPPOSITION

02:59:18.047 --> 02:59:19.482
TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS AN

02:59:19.548 --> 02:59:20.850
ACTIVITY AND LIKE MANY

02:59:20.916 --> 02:59:22.718
ACTIVITIES THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION

02:59:22.785 --> 02:59:24.453
OF THE RISK IN THE ACTIVITIES.

02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:26.455
THOSE ACTIVITIES OR SKY DIVING

02:59:26.522 --> 02:59:29.058
SKIING THIS IS NOT AN ACTIVITY.

02:59:29.125 --> 02:59:31.460
THIS IS A A BUSINESS PROVIDING

02:59:31.527 --> 02:59:33.362
TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FOR

02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:34.797
WHICH THEY CHARGE.

02:59:34.864 --> 02:59:36.365
IT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY

02:59:36.432 --> 02:59:37.900
THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN ENJOY IT.

02:59:37.967 --> 02:59:39.168
YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME THE RISK

02:59:39.235 --> 02:59:40.736
BUT THAT THE PARALLEL OF THAT IS

02:59:40.803 --> 02:59:42.037
RENTING A CAR THAT'S A

02:59:42.104 --> 02:59:43.973
CONVERTIBLE IN BECAUSE IT CAN BE

02:59:44.039 --> 02:59:45.407
FUN BECAUSE THE WIND BLOWS

02:59:45.474 --> 02:59:46.642
THROUGH YOUR HAIR.

02:59:46.709 --> 02:59:47.710
DID THEN THERE SHOULD BE AN

02:59:47.776 --> 02:59:50.045
ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK FOR USING

02:59:50.112 --> 02:59:51.347
THAT VEHICLE.

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:52.848
THE ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK IS IS

02:59:52.915 --> 02:59:54.550
BAD POLICY.

02:59:54.617 --> 02:59:55.851
IT BENEFITS AND PROVIDES

02:59:55.918 --> 02:59:59.121
PROTECTION FOR ONLY ONE ENTITY

02:59:59.188 --> 03:00:00.523
THE ENTITY WORTH BILLIONS OF

03:00:00.589 --> 03:00:02.224
DOLLARS THAT HAS NO INCENTIVE

03:00:02.291 --> 03:00:04.727
THEN TO REPAIR MAINTAIN OR MAKE

03:00:04.793 --> 03:00:06.262
SURE THEIR PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:07.530
THEIR INTENDED USERS.

03:00:07.596 --> 03:00:09.532
SO I I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:11.367

THIS BILL IS HEADING.

MOBILITY DEVICES ARE REMAINING

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:45.961
CONCERN THE WAIVERS AND RELEASES

ARE STANDARD FEATURES --

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:49.198
DESIGNED TO PROTECT COMPANIES

03:01:49.265 --> 03:01:50.933
FROM LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTS

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.134
BECAUSE THROUGH NO FAULT OF

NEGLIGENCE STANDARD STILL

03:01:55.437 --> 03:01:57.840

03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:29.938
PROVISION WOULD PROHIBIT ACCESS

TO THE PRODUCTS FOR THOSE WHO

03:02:31.073 --> 03:02:33.242
DON'T HAVE A DIGITAL APPLICATION.

IDEAL CAMPUS TO HAVE THEM BUT

03:06:30.946 --> 03:06:32.147
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

03:06:32.214 --> 03:06:32.447
ACCIDENTS?

03:06:32.514 --> 03:06:33.448

REGULATORY.

03:06:38.487 --> 03:06:40.322

03:06:41.623 --> 03:06:42.958
IN A MANNER THAT STILL ALLOWS

03:06:43.025 --> 03:06:44.526

SAN FRANCISCO INTENSELY IT'S

03:07:12.287 --> 03:07:13.322

WHO'S USED THESE DEVICES I

03:07:18.126 --> 03:07:19.428
HAPPEN TO THINK ELECTRIC BIKES

03:07:19.494 --> 03:07:20.829
AND SCOOTERS AND OTHER SHARE

MOBILITY DEVICES ARE.

03:07:22.364 --> 03:07:24.433
CONVENIENT ARE ECO FRIENDLY ARE

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:25.867
GOOD ALTERNATIVE MODES FOR

03:07:25.934 --> 03:07:27.569
TRANSIT TO DEAL WITH CONGESTION

03:07:27.636 --> 03:07:29.605
BUT THAT BEING SAID WE NEED SOME

03:07:29.671 --> 03:07:30.205
RULES OF THE ROAD WE NEED TO

03:07:30.272 --> 03:07:31.173
HAVE.

03:07:31.239 --> 03:07:33.108

03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:36.345
THINK THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE

03:07:36.411 --> 03:07:38.146
THAT AS WELL -- AND WITH THAT

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:40.115
HAPPY TO SECOND THE MOTION I

03:07:42.918 --> 03:07:45.954
BY MEN THIS IS ALLISON A SECOND

03:07:46.021 --> 03:07:46.922
BY MISTER [inaudible]

03:07:46.989 --> 03:07:48.724
TOO ALL RIGHT.

APPRECIATE THAT I REMEMBER BACK

03:07:52.628 --> 03:07:54.796
TO THE TNC DEBATE IN THIS.

03:07:54.863 --> 03:07:57.633
HOUSE WHERE WE WERE ALL WRAPPED

03:07:57.699 --> 03:07:59.201
AROUND THE AXLE IF YOU WILL

03:07:59.267 --> 03:08:00.502
ABOUT.

03:08:00.569 --> 03:08:02.270
THE GIG ECONOMY AND MOVING

03:08:02.337 --> 03:08:03.338
FORWARD IN TECHNOLOGY AND ALL

03:08:03.405 --> 03:08:04.640
THAT AND ULTIMATELY IT WAS

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:06.541
INSURANCE QUESTION BECAUSE WE

03:08:06.608 --> 03:08:07.843
WERE LEAVING TO MANY PEOPLE

03:08:07.909 --> 03:08:09.344
WITHOUT RECOURSE.

03:08:09.411 --> 03:08:10.812
THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING HERE

03:08:10.879 --> 03:08:12.481
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT.

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:14.583
AS WE DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES

03:08:14.650 --> 03:08:16.151
AND CAPACITIES AND CAPABILITIES

03:08:16.218 --> 03:08:17.686
OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE

03:08:17.753 --> 03:08:19.021
THESE INTERESTING NEW AND

03:08:19.087 --> 03:08:20.355
INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:21.657
ALL WELL AND GOOD.

03:08:21.723 --> 03:08:23.659
BUT IN THE END WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

03:08:23.725 --> 03:08:25.394
SOMEONE IS INJURED AND THAT IS

03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:26.862
OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

03:08:26.928 --> 03:08:28.296
AND I THINK IT'S VERY

03:08:28.363 --> 03:08:30.065
APPROPRIATE FOR JURISDICTIONS.

03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:31.500
TO APPROPRIATELY REGULATE IN

03:08:31.566 --> 03:08:33.301
FACT THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THEY

03:08:33.368 --> 03:08:34.803
HAVE SOME.

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:36.772
CONSEQUENCES ON STREETS AND

03:08:36.838 --> 03:08:38.674
SIDEWALKS AND PARKING AND AND

03:08:38.740 --> 03:08:39.841
OTHER PLACES WHERE I KNOW WE'RE

03:08:39.908 --> 03:08:41.109
SEEING THIS IN SANTA CRUZ.

03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:43.412
WHICH FAVORS BICYCLE MOBILITY

03:08:43.478 --> 03:08:44.379
BUT YET.

03:08:44.446 --> 03:08:45.914
HAS SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH A

03:08:45.981 --> 03:08:47.215
LOT OF THE ELECTRIC BIKES THAT

03:08:47.282 --> 03:08:49.051
ARE THERE AND THE WAY THAT THEY

03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:40.475
OR OP IN THE OPERATING A

03:13:40.542 --> 03:13:42.444
WEAPONIZED DRONES WHICH I THINK

03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:43.111
IS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE IS

03:13:43.178 --> 03:13:44.212
A GOOD IDEA.

03:13:44.279 --> 03:13:45.313
HOWEVER THERE IS A DEFINITION OF

03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:46.881
WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS TO

03:13:46.948 --> 03:13:48.216
WEAPONIZE A DRONE.

03:13:48.283 --> 03:13:49.484
AND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYWHERE

03:13:49.551 --> 03:13:51.186

EXACTLY WHAT WEAPONIZED DRONES

03:13:57.392 --> 03:13:59.494
ARE YEAH I MEAN IT MIGHT SEEM

03:13:59.561 --> 03:14:00.295
OBVIOUS THAT WE DON'T WANT A

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:02.230
DRONE DROPPING A BOMB SURE.

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:03.765

COULD ARGUE THAT ONE EITHER WAY.

03:14:11.039 --> 03:14:12.640
SO -- I JUST THINK THAT THIS.

03:14:12.707 --> 03:14:14.676
DESERVE SOME MORE SPECIFICITY.

03:14:14.743 --> 03:14:16.745

RIGHT TO PRIVACY.

AND I THINK MOST ESPECIALLY

03:14:29.524 --> 03:14:30.458
THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE

03:14:30.525 --> 03:14:32.293
CONSTITUTION THAT SURROUNDING

SHOULD BE A SACROSANCT PLACE.

03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:40.735
AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES

03:14:40.802 --> 03:14:41.903
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

03:14:41.970 --> 03:14:44.339

EXTENT THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

03:20:50.805 --> 03:20:52.140
THIS CLARITY AND SOME OF THE

OF ACTION EXISTS.

03:20:56.444 --> 03:20:58.413
UNLIKELY IT DOES LIKE OTHER

HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

03:21:01.416 --> 03:21:03.117
WHICH PROVIDES.

03:21:03.184 --> 03:21:04.786
THE VICTIMS OF IS STRAIGHT

03:21:04.852 --> 03:21:07.388

SEEING THEIR RIGHTS -- ACTED.

03:21:12.927 --> 03:21:14.562
THIS ONE THIS.

03:21:14.629 --> 03:21:16.097

03:21:19.066 --> 03:21:21.402
AND FOR OTHERS LISTED IN THE

03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:24.739
CURRENT STATUTE -- ONE THING I

03:21:24.806 --> 03:21:26.641
WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE ONE OF

03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:28.342
THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BILL

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:29.277
IS THAT.

03:21:29.343 --> 03:21:31.946
IT PROVIDES FOR POSSIBLY DOUBLE

03:21:32.013 --> 03:21:32.580
DIPPING.

03:21:32.647 --> 03:21:36.117
BY SOMEBODY FILING DUAL ACTIONS.

03:21:36.184 --> 03:21:38.619
BUT I THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS --

03:21:38.686 --> 03:21:40.354
PRETTY MUCH TO SPELLS THAT.

03:21:40.421 --> 03:21:42.190
A POSSIBILITY BUT I KNOW IT

03:21:42.256 --> 03:21:43.891
POINTING OUT THAT IF A PERSON

03:21:43.958 --> 03:21:46.561
WERE TO GO TO THE TAKE THE

03:21:46.627 --> 03:21:49.430
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY AND OBTAIN.

03:21:49.497 --> 03:21:51.632
OF GOVERNMENT AGAIN TO THAT

03:21:51.699 --> 03:21:53.734
CIRCUMSTANCE THEN THERE WOULD BE

03:21:53.801 --> 03:21:55.169
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THEM TO

03:21:55.236 --> 03:21:57.672
GET UNDER A A COURT CASE.

03:21:57.738 --> 03:21:59.974
AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO POINT
