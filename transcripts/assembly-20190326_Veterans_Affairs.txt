ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES. TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE PRESIDING AB ONE SIXTY A BILL THAT WILL ALLOW A PRIVATE EMPLOYER THE ABILITY TO ENACT A VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE PROGRAM. THE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE IS RECOGNIZE AND ENJOYED AMONG PUBLIC EMPLOYERS HOWEVER PRIVATE EMPLOYERS ARE LIMITED TO ONLY VIETNAM WAR ERA VETERANS WHEN EXERCISING THEIR VOLUNTARY. VETERANS PREFERENCE AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF VIETNAM VETERANS MY AGE. LOOKING FOR A JOB. AB ONE SIXTY SIMPLY REVISES THE OUTDATED OVERSIGHT BY ALLOWING PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO EXERCISE A VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCE. TO ALL VETERANS WITH THE GENERAL OR HONORABLE DISCHARGE REGARDLESS OF THE ERA IN WHICH THEY SERVED. SIMILAR VOLUNTARY VETERANS PERFORMANCE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ENACTED IN THIRTY SEVEN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE MANAGED TO STAY COMPLIANT WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHICH PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION IN HIRING. THERE'S NO REASON CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF THE SAME. I HAVE A WHAT IS BETTER CHAIR. MY NAME'S JULIE WORLEY AND I AM AN HR CONSULTANT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. I AM THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA. SYSOP STATE WELL THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. I'M A MEMBER AND A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA HUMAN RESOURCE ASSOCIATION. AND THE H. R. PROFESSION IS EXTREMELY AND KEENLY AWARE OF THE STRUGGLES THAT OUR MEN AND WOMEN. FACE WHEN THEY ARE ENTERING THE WORK FORCE AFTER DEPLOYMENT OR THEIR TERM IS BEING VETERANS. CAL SHERMAN AND THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT HAVE A LONG COMMITMENT IN HIRING OUR NATION'S VETERANS. BOTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PARTNERSHIPS AND CONDUCTED EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE THE HIRING OF VETERANS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR EMPLOYERS TO HIRE VETERANS. AND ALLOW AN EMPLOYER TO EXERCISE A VOLUNTARY HIRING PREFERENCE EXCEPTION. FOR ALL VETERANS IS ONE SMALL WAY WE CAN FACILITATE HIRING. AB ONE SIXTIES ESTABLISHMENT OF A VOLUNTARY PREFERENCE POLICY. FOR EMPLOYERS IS A FAIR AND MEANINGFUL WAY TO ASSIST VETERANS IN OBTAINING GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. WHILE SHIELDING THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO EXERCISE THIS PREFERENCE FROM A POTENTIAL CLAIM OF DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS SET THREE WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. AND REPRESENTING AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA AMVETS DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS. VETERANS COUNCIL MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF CHAPTERS NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND VIÃ§T NAM VETERANS. OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL ON SUPPORT OF THIS. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JESSE VALLEJO WITH THE CIVIL JUSTICE SOCI ASIAN CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. FREDERICK RHOEMETALCES ME. CAN J. I. FORM OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANKS THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIE CARRIERS ARE WHAT THEY CALIFORNIAN PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION -- APPRECIATE THE INTENT BEHIND THE BILL AND IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE TO BE HERE IN OPPOSITION OUR ATTORNEYS. REPRESENT SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS AND DISCRIMINATION YOU SERRA AND STATE EQUIVALENT TYPE CLAIMS. ARE ISSUE WITH THIS BILL IF YOU KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE PURPOSE BEHIND IT WHY WE NEED TO AMEND OUR AND THIS DISCRIMINATION LAWS TO ALLOW FOR THIS KIND OF VETERANS PREFERENCE HIRING POLICY. IS BECAUSE WITHOUT SUCH EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION IT DOES ACTUALLY VIOLATE OUR INTO DISCRIMINATION LAWS. AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE HI THAT KIND OF VETERANS PREFERENCE POLICY HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT ON WOMEN. AND ALSO -- INDIVIDUALS FROM THE LGBT COMMUNITY ON THE EEOC HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN A SPECIFIC STANCE. EXPLAINING HOW A VETERANS HIRING POLICY DOES HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- AGAIN WOMEN MAKE UP MAKE UP JUST THE HISTORICAL AN ONGOING EXCLUSIONARY POLICIES. FOR LGBT INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT WHO WANT TO SERVE -- WE AGAIN ARE FOR THAT THIS WILL HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ALSO NEED. REMOVAL OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. YEAH BUT I'M SURE KEVIN BAKER FROM THE CONCERT LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THAT NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE YEAR -- OBVIOUSLY ISSUE IS VERY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF VETERANS -- IT ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT FRONTS -- AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN IN DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN -- TO TO ADDRESS THOSE IMPORTANT NEEDS ON IT GETS TRICKY HOWEVER WHEN WE START SINGLING OUT ONE GROUP THAT IS CURRENTLY PROTECTED UNDER THE FIRM PLANS HAVE. HOUSING ACT. LIKE OTHER GROUPS AND SAVE THOSE THAT ONE PARTICULAR GROUP CAN BE GRANTED PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OVER OTHERS AND JUSTIFYING INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION. SO THAT I THINK IS THE DIFFICULTY I THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE CAN AND SHOULD DO TO ADDRESS THE EMPLOYMENT NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A LIFE STEP. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TAMMY MARTIN WITH EQUALITY CALIFORNIA ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. NOW ALL RIGHT WE HAD A MOTION BY -- I'M SORRY. REMEMBER GLORIA SURE THERE WOULD BE OTHERS BESIDES ME OF THIS VOEPEL GOOD TO SEE SIR THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAD IN THE LAST -- BUT HE SAID SESSION SESSION CRACKED -- AT THAT TIME -- I'D RAISE CONCERNS TO YOU ABOUT THE ODDITY COMMUNITY -- AND THE POTENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESERVING OF THIS KIND OF PREFERENCE TO NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT BECAUSE OF OUR STATED OUR NATION'S OUTDATED -- DON'T ASK DON'T TELL POLICIES CAN TALK ABOUT -- HOW THIS BILL? BIG CONSIDERS THOSE KINDS OF VETERANS POLICY GIVEN THE CONCERNS OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA THIS AFTERNOON. YES SIR. THIS BILL TREATS ALL VETERANS EQUALLY [inaudible] AND I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN THE MILITARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRACK IT. THEY TREAT EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY ABSOLUTELY EQUAL I DO HAVE NUMBERS IF I MAY. UM IN CALIFORNIA ONE THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE RECRUITS WERE RECRUITED ACROSS THE FIVE BRANCHES IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GIANT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. WOMEN MAKE UP CURRENTLY IN THE MILITARY 16218% AND GROWING. OKAY SO YOUR NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT. OLD -- THEY ARE. COMPRISING 9% OF THE UNITED STATES VETERANS POPULATION BUT MUCH HIGHER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AMONG IN LISTED RECRUITS. 43% OF MEN AND 56% OF WOMEN ARE HISPANIC OR A RACIAL MINORITY. THAT'S HUGE THE MILITARY HAS CHANGED IS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY AND WOMEN. ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE THAN THE MEN SO IT IS PRETTY DRAMATIC AND I SEE WITHIN TEN YEARS WOMEN COMPRISE AT LEAST 30% OF THE MILITARY ESPECIALLY AS WE GO INTO THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY AREAS. I KEEP TRYING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GET NUMBERS ON LGBT Q. BECAUSE DON'T ASK DON'T TELL IS OVER. THE MILITARY'S OPEN THE ONLY THING THEY'RE NOT DOING NOW IS TRANS GENDER -- SURGERIES AND THAT MAY CHANGE VERY WELL IN THE FUTURE SO I WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN. CONFUSED WHY PEOPLE WOULD OPPOSE THIS BILL AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS BILL. IS MOST OF THESE KIDS GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THEY DID THERE FOR YEARS THEY COME BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN I ROCK WHERE EVER WE SEND THEM. THEY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY. YOU GOT TO DO THREE THINGS FARO AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT OTHERWISE THEY SLIDE OFF THE RADAR SCOPE NUMBER ONE THEY GOT TO GET A JOB. THEY DON'T GET A JOB THERE ARE DEEP TROUBLE. THEY NEED. TO GO TO SCHOOL USUALLY IT'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE HAVE FINE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE VETERAN PROGRAMS AND THEY GOT TO STAY OFF OF ABUSING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL IF THEY DO THOSE THREE THINGS. LIKE ME AS A VIETNAM VETERAN NAY COULD BE SITTING HERE SOME DAY. OR SUCCESSFUL IN BUSINESS KEEP THEIR FAMILIES FIGHT PTSD UNLESS YOU BETTER IN THE MILITARY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET YOUR **** KICKED. ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. AND THEN SOME. VIA AND I JUST FOR THAT FOR THE RECORD BE CLEAR THAT -- TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AMERICA AMERICANS CANNOT SERVE IN THE MILITARY GOV YOU KNOW KILEY OBVIOUSLY AND SO IT'S NOT THAT THE THAT OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND ALLOW IT'S JUST THERE'S ACTUAL SERVICE MILITARY NOT ALLOWED SO THAT. GETS COMPLICATED BUT I THINK THE PREVIOUSLY WERE SHOT EXTREME GOOD WILL AND TRYING TO BE BROADLY INCLUSIVE OF FOLKS WHO HAD HAVE A DISH CHARGES THAT WERE NOT HONORABLE NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR SERVICE BECAUSE OF WHO THEY WERE AND REFLECTION THE FACT ABOUT LAWS THAT CHANGE. AND I THINK THAT YOU'D STILL CONTINUE IN DENVER TO DO THAT WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. YEAH I THINK I WANT TO RAISE THE MENTION I THINK IT'S FAIR IS THAT THERE IS PRO EXPRESSED PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VETERANS ARE THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED -- IN EMPLOYMENT -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN YOUR OWN WORDS WHY THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT AND WHY THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO GO BEYOND THAT EXPRESSED PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION TO NATIONAL PREFERENCE. AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL? IT WILL PROTECT THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT WANT TO VOLUNTARILY GIVE PREFERENCE TO VETERANS FROM BEING SUED. BY ANOTHER [inaudible] GROUP. THAT'S AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO THIS IS NOT ANY KIND OF A OF AGGRESSIVE WAY TO RECRUIT. VETERANS SIMPLY TO PROTECT THEM FROM A PROTECTED CLASS. GOING AFTER A IN THIS IS A VERY SMALL SUBSET. OF OUR POPULATION. THEY KERRY'S THE BURDEN OF DEFENDING THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU SIR BYE. GREAT JOB -- THANK YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A POWER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I TO SUPPORT VETERANS AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TO GET THEM JOBS I DO SHARE THE CONCERNS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION I THINK WE'LL VETERANS AS GROUP WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE -- THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT AND MAKE SURE THEY GET JOBS I WOULD SAY WHAT ABOUT WOMEN WHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOMEN AND SCIENCE SHOULD WE START GIVING ALLOWING A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- FOR WOMEN IN ON ON REPRESENT UNDER REPRESENTED -- INDUSTRIES TO HAVE LONG HAIR PROGRAMS THERE I THINK WE GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY SLOPE -- SO WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD SET FOR OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES IF WE WORSHIP TO DO THIS TODAY. WELL THIRTY SEVEN OTHER STATES HAVE BASICALLY THE SAME BILL. THEY'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. SO THAT PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR SLIPPERY SLOPE DOESN'T EXIST IN THIRTY SEVEN STATES I DON'T SEE HOW CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DIFFERENT. RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. OF MY I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- I WAS I AND I KNOW WHERE THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS -- I I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT IT BUT I THINK THEY MAKE SOME OF THE VERY THEY HAVE SOME VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS IT AS IT MOVES TO THE FLOOR AND THEN THROUGH THE SENATE I HOPE THAT YOU WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE IF THERE IS A SOLUTION HERE. WE'LL DO. RIGHT CAN I HAVE THE SECRETARY PLEASE TO THE ROLE.

TO THE OVER FIVE MILLION. WE KNOW THAT THIS MONEY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GO AFTER MONEY AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. TWO THEN EXPAND ON THE TYPE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE ON THE GROUND. SO THAT IS THE BILL BEFORE YOU IT IS ASKING FOR AN ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT OUR COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS. HAVE THE NECESSARY.
