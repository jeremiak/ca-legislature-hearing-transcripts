I'LL BE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK RG DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES GOOD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU ARE CALIFORNIA ARE MERGING SEASON DISASTERS ARE MORE FREQUENT COMPLICATED AND OFTEN INVOLVING MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND REGIONS OF THE STATE. AND MANY AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT ALL WILDFIRE EARTHQUAKE FLOODING FLASH FLOODING MUDFLOW TSUNAMIS DROUGHTS HAS MATCHED POWER OUTAGES AND SECURITY THREATS. AND WE LIKE YOU. WITNESSED TOO MANY TIMES THE DEVASTATION OF A COMMUNITY HIT BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS. THE STRUCTURAL AND FINANCIAL RECOVERIES FOR COMMUNITIES ARE LONG. AND CHALLENGING PARTICULARLY FOR THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES OF OUR STATE. GIVEN THAT HE'S EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ARE FAR MORE FREQUENT. AND COMPLICATED THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES SIXTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR A HUNDRED FOURTEEN POSITIONS THE STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY CAPABILITIES TO BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS INITIATIVE DOES THE FOLLOWING. IT ESTABLISHES A PERMANENT INCIDENT SUPPORT TEAM WITHIN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM MORE QUICKLY RESPOND. AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE INSURE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND LESSEN OUR CURRENT RELIANCE ON RE DIRECTED STAFF TO DO SO- AN OPERATIONAL MODEL IS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE. IT ESTABLISHES A NEW OFFICE OF EQUITY. TO BUY ALCOHOL CALORIE HAS TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONNECTIONS WITH THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AFTER DISASTER RESPONSE LEVEL AND FURTHER ELEVATE EQUITY AS A CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE ORGANIZATION. IT ALSO PROVIDES PERMANENT RESOURCES FOR THE LEAST THOSE PROGRAM AND EXPANDS ITS FOCUS TO INCLUDE RESPONSIVE RECOVERY PROGRAMS. THE BILL BETTER SERVICE TO DISASTER SURVIVORS AND TO COMMUNITIES. EVERYPLACE IS ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS AND LEVERAGES INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO MODERNIZE THE STATE'S CAPABILITIES THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND STRENGTH IN DATA ANALYTICS. AS DISASTERS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON PEOPLE ARE PROPERLY- AND PROPERTY HAVE INCREASED TIMELY DATA AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS ARE EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING. AND IT ESTABLISHES A NEW CALL COST RECOVERY UNIT AT CALLIOSTOMATIDAE MICE FEDERAL EMERGENCY AND DISASTER DOLLAR RECOVERY PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA. AS THE STATE'S LEAD AGENCY FOR FRIEDMAN DAHLE A FEDERAL DOLLARS. THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN BILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS RECOVERED AND PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND I AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FINALLY THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. A HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION THE GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE PERMANENT FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL LONG TERM COST RECOVERY POSITIONS. THESE WOULD BETTER SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY EFFORTS. TO ACCELERATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GET OUR COMMUNITIES BACK UP ON THEIR FEET AND THE RECRUITMENT OF ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND MAXIMIZE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION HAPPENING ANSWERING QUESTIONS. NEWS SURE YES WE HAVE THE ALEJO HAVE ANY COMMENTS. MANAGER SENATORS YOU'RE SORT OF WORK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE IT GIVE OUR COMMENTS ON EACH OF THE PROPOSALS PRESENTED. TO BEGIN WITH ALL SPEAK TO THE PERMANENT STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TEAM. RISIBLE WE FIND THE PROPOSAL TO KEEP TO CREATE A DEDICATED SOCCER TEAM REASONABLE HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT- WE ASKED WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE DATA ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY GETTING REDIRECTED TO THE SOCCER TEAMS. ARE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD AS SUCH IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES PROPOSED IS APPROPRIATE. WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE AN OFFICE OF EQUITY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE LIST DOES GRANT PROGRAM WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL IS PROMISING HOWEVER THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED TO BEGIN WITH- THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS WE THINK. WE ARE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO. SPECIFICALLY WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE SUPPORED HOW FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITISED BETWEEN SUPPORTED SERVICES HOW- YES WOULD IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICES. AND HOW- YES WOULD PRIORITIZE FUNDING BETWEEN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND FINALLY WHETHER OUTCOME DATA WOULD BE COLLECTED AND USED TO INFORM FUTURE GRANT AWARDS. WITH RESPECT TO THE- DISASTER COST TRACKING AND RECOVERY UNIT IN THE MODERNIZATION- YES TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYTICS WE FIND THE PROPOSAL REASONABLE HOWEVER WE ARE INFORMED THAT- YES HAS NOT SUBMITTED REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. RELATED TO THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS OF THESE PROPOSALS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THESE DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE IT APPROVES ANY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNDING. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE THESE PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD IT COULD APPROVE THE FUNDING ALONG WITH PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT THESE DOCUMENTS BE PROVIDED TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. BEFORE FUNDS. FOR THESE PROJECTS CAN BE EXPANDED. IN ADDITION WE THAT IT LARGEST. CHIU TO APPROVE THESE PROPOSALS IT WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MONTHLY REPORTS ON STATE EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES SOMETHING OUR OFFICE HAS RECOMMENDED. THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER EMERGENCY RESPONSE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE LONG TERM RECOVERY- YOU KNOW THAT- YES. YEAH THANK YOU- I JUST STUCK MISTER CARTOON TO COULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE L. A. L. I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO MANAGER- MAYBE I'LL START OFF WITH THE- THE ISSUE OF BROCK ARE REDIRECTING STAFF- AND THE EFFORT THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN AND AMPLIFYING OUR ABILITY TO HAVE A PERMANENT CAPABILITY- AS I MENTIONED- YOU KNOW TODAY IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER. THE MODEL THAT WE USE THAT THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR ALL ALL UP SOME TIME IS A CALORIE ASKED. REDIRECTS STAFF FROM CORE FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND TO AND SUPPORT THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS OF A DISASTER. THIS IS JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR MURDER SHOULD BE SPONSORED RECOVERY TODAY GIVEN THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF DISASTERS. THE REDIRECTION OF STAFF RESULTS IN DELAYS IN PROCESSING OF KEY ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. BURKE JUST ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE A ROUGHLY A THREE MONTH BACKLOG IN CONTRACTS AND INVOICES. THE DELAYS IN PROCESSING OF CONTRACTS AND WE'RE JUST COULD RISK CALAVERAS IS ABILITY TO SECURE VITAL SERVICES NEEDED. FORMER JUST USER STEADY STATE WORK SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER- OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS. DELAYS ALSO IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE HIRING PROCESS OCCUR AND RESULT IN- YES LOSING OUT ON QUALIFIED CANDIDATES THIS IMPACTS OUR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. IT A GREAT DEAL ALL CANDIDATES ARE TYPICALLY NOTIFIED THAT THEY WILL BE RE DIRECTED TO OTHER DUTIES IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY AND WORK INCREASED OVERTIME OVERTIME IS A HUGE ISSUE BECAUSE OF THIS AS WELL AS THINGS START TO STACK UP. IT CANDIDATES OFTEN CITED AS A REASON FOR NOT ACCEPTING A POSITION OTHER CITED AS A REASON FOR LEAVING THE DEPARTMENT. AS WELL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS GET THE LATEST OFFER ALL OF OUR PERSONNEL AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO OFFER TRAINING THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING INSTITUTE. I'LL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES R. AS A PART OF THE REQUIRED- ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THAT REQUIRES TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND ULTIMATELY THE BIG IT HUGE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH AND STRESS OF OUR EMPLOYEES THAT- HOW THEIR STEADY STATE WORK AND THEN GET THE PLOY EIGHT TO BACK TO BACK DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES. ARE US AT YOU KNOW AT TIMES BEING OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER FOR WEEKS- ADDED- AND- ONLY TO GET RECYCLED BACK. TO THEIR HEAVY STEADY STATE AND THEN RECYCLED BACK INTO THE STATE OPERATIONS. CENTER- TAKES A HUGE TOLL ON THEM IN THE- AND EXTENDS TO THEIR FAN. THIS THIS THIS ESTABLISHING IS. THAT WORKS TOGETHER AND GENERATES EFFICIENCIES AND STRATEGIES THAT COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED USING THE EXISTING STRUCTURE THIS THE SANITIZATION OF A TEAM HAS A FOCUS ON BEING ABLE TO RAPIDLY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY AND THIS WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT PROCEDURES AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN PLACE. AS ACTIVATION STAFF ARE PULLED TOGETHER ON THESE TWO WEEKS- ROTATIONS PER MINUTE STAFF WAS SURE- THAT WE GET OF COURSE RESPOND RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE BETWEEN OUR RESPONSE STAFF ARE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS- AND MORE EFFECTIVELY AND CONTINUE. TO BE ON THE WORK IT RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS OUR THROUGH THE RECOVERY OPERATION SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ON THE- ON THE- THE NEED TO START TO MOVE. QUITE FRANKLY I I'M. SENSITIVE TO THE ALEJO'S.

WHAT IS CALIFORNIA GOTTEN FORCE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESPONSE CALIFORNIA ALREADY TWENTY OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF LEAST OF CALIFORNIA REPAIRS CAMPAIGN FLOW THROUGH HELLO YES. IN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE SELECTED LEAD COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES WHO IN TURN SUB GRANTED THE FUNNY TO OVER THREE HUNDRED SMALLER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THIS WAS POWERFUL BECAUSE THESE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WORK ON THE GROUND THEY WERE EMBEDDED IN THE COMMUNITY THEY WERE THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY. THE OTHER THIRTY MILLION OF THE VET CAME THROUGH CAL VOLUNTEERS SUPPORT VOLUNTEER AND SERVICE TEAMS LIKE SEARCH THE COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND AMERICORPS AND COMMUNICATIONS MATERIALS CREATED RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. APRIL TWENTY OF TWENTY ONE LEAGUE PLEASE THOSE CALIFORNIA REACH MORE THAN THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH THIS AFTER READING THIS EDUCATION. OUR OLDER. WE SERVE FORTY NINE COUNTIES ARE AND OVER SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE WERE REACH WITH COVERT NINETEEN SAFETY MESSAGES MORE THAN EIGHTY NEW RESOURCES WERE DEVELOPED IN OVER TWENTY LANGUAGES. AND FIFTY COUNTY DISASTER DIRECTORS DIRECTORIES WERE DEVELOPED AND WILL BE POSTED ON THE LEAST THOSE CALIFORNIA DOT ORG WEBSITE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH.

AS SOCIAL BRIDGING PROJECT PHONE CALLS TO ISOLATED CALIFORNIANS SHARE PORN INFORMATION LIKE WHERE TO FIND FOOD RESOURCES AND HOW TO SIGN UP FOR THE LOCAL EMERGENCY ALERTS. THIS TWENTY TWO MONTH EFFORT WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THIS AND MORE BECAUSE IT WAS DONE TO TRUSTED PARTNERS ALL THE WHILE WHILE THE STATE WAS EXPERIENCING A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. AND SEVERE WILDFIRE SEASON AND AGAIN THIS IS THE BASELINE THE FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF BUILDING DISASTER RESILIENT CALIFORNIA AND SO MOVING FORWARD THE INITIATIVES ARE TO AMPLIFY THAT EFFORT. AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITIES THAT YOU OUR- ARE AS PREPARED FOR DISASTER. AND ABLE TO NAVIGATE. THE. DISASTERS REPORT TO SEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE THOSE ANSWERS- IT'S VERY VERY THOROUGH- I WANT TO ASK YOU- BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY AS I UNDERSTAND IT TWENTY SEVEN STATE AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN EQUITY WORK- HAVE YOU UP THOUGHT ABOUT THE KIND OF EITHER COORDINATION OR ABILITY TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER. DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING SIMILAR EQUITY WORK. ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS A CURRENT BILL RIGHT NOW OUGHT TO CREATE THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY WHICH PROPOSES TO CENTRALIZE AND STANDARDIZED ON EQUITY FRAMEWORK BUT- ANY THOUGHTS OR EXPERIENCE ON THAT. AT THE EXPENSE OF A QUESTION AND A YES- WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AND WORKING WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES ARE AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE DOING OUR RESEARCH AS WELL ABOUT WHAT IS BEING- DEVELOP ACROSS THE B. R. AND WE HAVE STATE AGENCIES. I WILL I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE EQUITY. PIECE I MEAN THERE OBVIOUSLY IS A LOT OF SYNERGY THAT WE NEED TO- LEVERAGE AND BILL BECAUSE WHEN WE RESPOND TO DISASTER IT'S NOT JUST- YES RESPONDING TO DISASTER. BUT IT'S ALL THE STATE FAMILY RESPONDING TO A DISASTER THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY IN BEING ABLE TO DELIVER DISASTER RESPONSE. WELL START BACK WITH THE BILL THE- PRINCIPLES OF LIVING EQUITY START PLANNING CASE WHERE WERE WERE WORK ENTERING IT THAT'S WHY THE LEAST THOSE PROGRAM IS SO IMPORTANT. ON THE FRONT AND- IN BEGIN BUILDING THAT BASS LINE THAT FOUNDATION. OF BROADBAND THAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO THE RESPONSE. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO COMMUNITY NO INDIVIDUAL IS LEFT BEHIND. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY EQUALLY RECEIVED DISASTER AID. AND I AM IN THE MOST EQUITABLE FASHION- AND THAT THAT NO ONE NO ONE IS AFRAID TO BE ABLE TO GET ASSISTANCE. AND THAT THAT GOES THROUGH ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE RECOVERY PROCESS AND SO THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE THIS IS TO THE EQUITY IN BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY DELIVER DISASTER. AND HUMANITARIAN AID- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE NEED TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO THE OTHER STATE FAMILY. THAT WE TASK TO SUPPORT US IN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE WILL COORDINATE WITH THOSE OTHER STATE AGENCIES- BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME VERY UNIQUE. EQUITY RELATED ISSUES WITH THIS ASTOR. DISASTER DELIVERY OF OBJECT PROGRAMS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW- I'M CARRYING THEM A BILL FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ON DOMESTIC WORKERS AND- THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THE HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THEY WORK. AND WHAT BROUGHT UP WHAT BROUGHT ME TO THAT WAS MANY MANY STORIES OF DAY LABORERS. AND DOMESTIC WORKERS WHO WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH ANY INFORMATION ABOUT. THEIR RIGHT TO EITHER LEAVE. OR THEIR RIGHTS ON- HOW TO CLEAN. UP TOXIC- THAT WERE LESS AS WE OF THE FIRES- THERE ARE A NUMBER VERY DISTURBING STORIES SO. I'M I'M SURE HOPING THAT INCLUDED IN OUR THE PLANNING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HERE'S HOW TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND PROTECTION FOR- THOSE WHO DON'T LIVE IN THE AREA BUT WORK IN THE AREA- AND- MAY HAVE LANGUAGE ISSUES MAY HAVE IMMIGRATION STATUS ISSUES. BUT THEY'RE WORKING IN THEIR- AND AGAIN MANY TIMES DIDN'T GET THE KIND OF. PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEEDED AND DESERVED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK IT'S A GOOD. VERY IMPORTANT POINT. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S AGAIN SOME OF THAT AS WE AS WE START MOVING SO FAST TO RESPOND TO THESE DISASTERS AND DISASTERS ARE SO FREQUENT. AND THEY AND THEY BECOME EVER MORE COMPLICATED JUST BECAUSE OF THE OF THE SCOTT SIZE SCOPE AND SCALE THAT WE'RE SEEING- THIS IS THESE ARE THE AREAS WE DO NOT WANT TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND IT REALLY DOES WHAT YOU JUST SAID REALLY SPEAKS- AS AS THE- ONE OF THE KEY AREAS OF US BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS- THAT. EFFORT NOT JUST WITH LEAST THOSE ARE RIGHT BUT BAKING IN THE EQUITY RELATED- PRINCIPLES THROUGH ALL OF OUR UP TO OUR REGIONAL OPERATIONS DOWN TO OUR FIRST RESPONDER LEVELS. MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ARENA IS ADDRESSING THAT IN THAT FASHION WE WANTED TO BE ON THE FRONT END OF THE FOURTH FOUGHT NOT AS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AFTER THE FACT SO. I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL ON THAT AND- IN GET YOUR YOUR ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK QUITE I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COLLEAGUES CENTER NEWMAN ANY. QUESTIONS ARE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU ALL OF OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS- PROVIDE TO CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU.

FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE CRISIS CENTERS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS THE STATE SHARE OF CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL VOCA FUNDING HAS DECREASED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THE FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. A LOT OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY. TWENTY THREE- THROUGH THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS WILL ENSURE SERVICE PROVIDERS MANY OF WHICH ARE NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE ABLE TO PLAN AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE IS VERY CRITICAL RESOURCES AND SERVICES. THE VICTIMS OF. A CRIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THERE ARE SOME- I MEAN THE L. A. WOULD PLEASE. SORT OF BORED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY EFFORTS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THROUGH THE FOCUS THANKS ACT THAT COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDINGLY IF IT'S THE LEGISLATURE GOAL TO MAINTAIN THESE SERVICES IT COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING ANY FUNDS NOT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING SERVICE LEVEL TO RIVER AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THANK YOU AND DON'T FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TAT. OKAY WOUND THAT COLLEAGUES- MISTER CENTER NEWMAN NO CRISIS MANAGER OKAY ALL RIGHT- THAT'S ALL HOLD OPEN ITEM AS WELL AGAIN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH- NEXT IS- ISSUE THREE COMMUNITY HARDENING TO BUILD DISASTER RESILIENCE OF COMMUNITIES. AGAIN NO THANKS MADAM CHAIR- DOES SPEAKING OF THE SAME SORT OF- YOU KNOW FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW WE- WE JUST RECENTLY TALKED ABOUT LEAST DOES AND- AND BUILDING OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND. THIS IS AN INITIATIVE- THAT IS FOCUSED ON- ON ON BUILDING DISASTER RESILIENT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE KNOW THAT- WITH THE KIND OF DISASTERS WERE SEEING THE FREQUENCY SCOPE AND SCALE BIG BIG OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- ARE GETTING YOU KNOW JUST HOW DID ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH REGARD SOMETIMES. THEY'RE THEY'RE RESPONDING TO A NEW DISASTER WHILE THEY'RE HAVING TO STILL BE RECOVERING FROM THE PREVIOUS DISASTER AND YOU KNOW THIS FOCUS IS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF DISASTER REBUILD DISASTER REFILL. SO TO STRENGTHEN AND BETTER PREPARE OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW INITIATIVE CALLED REPAIR CALIFORNIA. BUILDING DISASTER RESILIENT COMMUNITIES THIS IS FOUNDATIONAL- IN THAT IT REALLY DOES FOCUS ON BUILDING UP A FRAMEWORK AND. AN OUT AND OUT- OF. I NEVER THROUGHOUT OUR LOW CAN I IMAC THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT NOT NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS ARE THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO RECOGNIZE AND SYNERGIZE RISK PRIORITIZATION AND UP RELATED ACTION AND HELPS TO ADDRESS CURRENT BARRIERS FOR LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THIS FUNDING WHICH SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO ADDRESS ALL HAZARDS. VULNERABILITIES ARE AND BUILD- RESILIENCY AND PROTECT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES BEFORE DISASTERS WITH THE SUPPORT OF STATE GOVERNMENT AND AGAIN I EMPHASIZE BUILDING THAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTIVE ABILITY BEFORE DISASTERS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE THAT CAPABILITY. WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS. THE PROGRAM WOULD TARGET DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PROMOTING THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR STATEWIDE RESILIENCY EDUCATION TO ALL HOUSES TO PARTNERSHIPS ENGAGEMENTS AND COMMUNITY HARDING PROGRAMS. WILL ALSO INCLUDE FUNDING TO HELP RELIEVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF UP 21100% OF. THEIR SHARE OF COST REQUIRED BURKE MITIGATION PROJECTS UNDER THE FEDERAL HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM. WHICH HAS BEEN A BARRIER FOR MANY MANY COMMUNITIES ARE AS AS A FIRST RESPONDER I WILL TELL YOU I HAVE SEEN AND WALK THROUGH TOO MANY COMMUNITIES. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN LEVEL BY DISASTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THOSE LIVES ARE FOREVER CHANGED BY THESE EVENTS- WE KNOW THAT DISASTERS WILL HAPPEN BUT WE CAN'T DO A BETTER JOB IS SUPPORTING A PREPARING OUR COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY THE L. A- PLEASE. WELL MY COMMUNITY HARDENING ACTIVITIES CAN ACHIEVE NOTABLE BENEFITS- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY HOW FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITIZE BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAZARDS SUCH AS WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS HOW FUNDS WOULD BE DIVIDED BETWEEN OFFSETTING FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE OFFSET HOW DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WOULD BE IDENTIFIED AND HOW FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITISED BETWEEN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO APPROVE THIS FUNDING IT COULD STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE ON COULD CHOOSE TO DIRECT A CERTAIN PORTION OR ALL OF THESE FUNDS TOWARDS A SPECIFIC TYPE OF HAZARDS SUCH AS WILDFIRES AND IFIT CHOSE TO TAKE THIS ROUTE IT COULD DO SO BY ADOPTING PROVISIONAL OR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I'M HAPPY TO SEE QUE QUE QUESTIONS THANK YOU AGAIN MR GARDNER G. COULD YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO THE L. A. L. HAPPY DEMAND. THANK YOU- AND THANKS OPEN QUESTION- SO THE FIRST ONE IS HEALTH PLAN TO RE PRIORITIZE BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAZARDS. SUCH AS WILDFIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS. THE PROJECTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE MITIGATION STRATEGIES GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN AND A LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. AND RISK ASSESSMENTS OF LOCAL COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER RESILIENCY ROUNDTABLES WILL BE THE VEHICLE THAT HELPS US TO PRIORITIZE THIS FUNDING. EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS A SIGNATURE ARE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF RISKS AND THREATS NOT YOU CAN'T HATE THE STATE ABROAD RUSSIAN AND EVERYBODY. NOT EVERYBODY HAS A WALL PARKS RACK NOT EVERYBODY HAS EARTHQUAKE THREAT BUT WE DO NEED TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THREATS EXIST AND- AND THAT THAT ENGAGEMENT- WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS IS CRITICAL AS WELL AS ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE STATE LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. COMMUNITIES WILL UNDERGO A COMPREHENSIVE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING PROCESS WHERE THEY IDENTIFY THEIR GREATEST HAZARDS. COMMUNITIES CAN THEN SUBMIT PROJECTS TO ADDRESS THEIR HOUSES BASED UPON. THE GREATEST LOCAL MEAT FUNDS WILL BE PRIORITIZED FOR PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE MULTI HAZARD BENEFITS. FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING FOR FLOOD FIRE OR EARTHQUAKE. AND THAT ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE CONDITIONS ALERT AND WARNING FOR EXAMPLE OFFER ALL HAZARDS OR PROJECTS TO ADAPT ALL HAZARD BUILDING CODE INCREASES OR POSSIBLY. LAND USE PLANNING CHANGES. HOW WILL FIND HOW FUNDS WERE BE GIVE BETWEEN ALSO FED MATCHING. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THERE IS NO SET AMOUNT DEDICATED TO FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. HELLO YES IT TENDS TO DO EXTENSIVE OUTREACH WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE GREATEST NEED. AFTER LOCATION FOR SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WILL INCLUDE SOME ASSISTANCE WITH A COST SHARE BROWSER MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE FOR OTHERS IT MAY BE FOR OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR PROVIDING SEED MONEY FOR PROJECT SCOPING AND DEVELOPMENT OR INVESTMENT IN MITIGATION PROJECT AND IN FACT- PART OF THIS FUNDING WOULD GO UP- AND BEAT LAMPERT USED TO BRING A- THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. RESILIENCY ROUND TABLES TOGETHER- IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTION IT'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE NON GOVERNMENTAL FAITH BASED WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACH- AND WE HAVE TO BREAK THE CYCLE. AND THERE'S NOTHING LINEAR ABOUT THIS DISASTER PLANNING AND RESPONSE IT'S VERY ASYMMETRICAL SO WE NEED TO APPROACH IT IN THAT MANNER TO BE OUT IN FRONT OF FUTURE DISASTERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH FEDERAL MATCHING REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE OFFSET DALY ABROAD PROGRAM GOOD POINT. UNDER THE ACT HI OTHER MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM THE ELIGIBLE FEDERAL SHARE IS UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. WITH THE LOCAL COST SHARE REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT DETERMINE THEIR GREATEST NEED. TO INCLUDE ASSISTANCE WITH THE LOCAL COST YEAR WITH THE FEDERAL HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM. FUNDING WOULD BE A- AVAILABLE FOR UP TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN GETTING THOSE MITIGATION PROGRESS STARTED. THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA METRICS THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE COST YEAR OFFSET THE TERMINATION IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED BUT WILL INCLUDE A CONSIDERATION. FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS WELL THE QUESTION WAS DISADVANTAGED WOULD BE IDENTIFIED. THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION OUR PLAN INCLUDES A VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HAZARDS IN CALIFORNIA OVERLAID WITH SOCIAL GOING TO RELOOK PEAK WITHIN THE STATE. LOCAL MITIGATION PLANS SIMILAR INCLUDES THIS ANALYSIS. JUST FIFTY THIS SERVES S A ROADMAP TO IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST AREA OF NEED A COMBINED WITH EXPERTISE FROM THE CALLOW YES OFFICE OF EQUITY AND OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS. AND USING EXISTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY DEFINITIONS WILL RESULT IN COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSISTENT PROGRAM METRICS. AS WELL ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS DISASTER IMPACT. IMPACTS COMMUNITY HISTORY OF MITIGATING HIGH RISK COMMUNITY INTEREST AND CAPACITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE CONSIDERATION FACTORS. AS WELL THE QUESTION WAS HOW FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THESE DETAILS ARE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY HOWEVER IT WILL BE LEVEL IT WILL WILL WILL LEVERAGE BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS COMPLY. WITH HOUSING PROFILE ANALYSIS WILL INFORM PROCESS THAT ENSURES PROJECTS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN AREAS THAT INCREASE AND BUILD A FOUNDATION OF COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. WHERE THE GREATEST NEED EXIST. THANK THANK YOU HAVE ARE HAPPENING AT FOR THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. RESHAPE THAT- CENTER NEWMAN I'D DO HAVE A GREGORY. AB SO YOU TO THE- YES SORRY IT GOES WITH TO GET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE OVER LET'S DO THAT HOLD ON ONE SECOND. NOTHING FURTHER TO FURTHER TO AND CHECK THANK YOU YOU INTIMIDATE. NOT LIKELY. MY QUESTION SO THANK YOU THE- YES DO YOU PREFER TO SPEAK TODAY THERE IS A NOTE IN MY ANALYSIS THAT THAT INDICATES THE STATE WOULD PRIORITIZE THE GRANT FUNDS FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION SAID- CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S THE STANDARD FOR WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND HOW WAS IT. ASSESSED YEAH SO GOOD QUESTION- I THINK THAT THAT BUT CONSERVE BY WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY. ENGAGEMENT IS THAT WHAT WHAT WE WANT IS WE WANT OUR- IN THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. WE DON'T WANT TO JUST HAVE ANOTHER ONE OFF RAMP THAT GOES TO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR TO AN ENTITY- THAT- IT MAYES ACCOMPLISH A SINGLE- MITIGATION EFFORT FIVE IT DOESN'T BUILD THIS THIS CONCEPT OF RESILIENCY SO WHAT WE WOULD. WE WOULD DO IS WE WOULD LOOK AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN OUR IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IN OUR PARTNERSHIP AND- IT COURAGE THEM TO BRING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND WE WOULD ASK THEM HOW THEY'RE GOING TO. BE ABLE TO BRING THE WHOLE TREE TOGETHER AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF EXAMPLES- AND TECHNICAL GUIDANCE ON HOW TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP THE FABRIC OF THAT COMMUNITY PEOPLE LIVE. GO TO CHURCH GO TO SCHOOL SHOP FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS THESE ARE ALL ENTITIES WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN DISASTER AFTER DISASTER THERE ARE NOT ONLY IMPACTED BY THE DISASTERS BUT ALSO A SOLUTION TO THE RECOVERY AFTER THE DISASTER AND WHAT WE WANT IS- TO THE LEVERAGE ALL OF THOSE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- AND SO WHAT WE WOULD LOOK TO. IF YOU WOULD SEE WOULD RECEIVE WHAT COMMUNITIES. WHAT WHAT TREATING GAVE IT CAN BE HAD- HOW MUCH CAN BE INVESTED ON THE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY IT'S THE WILL IT'S NOT JUST THE POLITICAL WELL OPERATIONAL WELL- YOU KNOW WILL PROVIDE FUNDING AND WILL PROVIDE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WRAPAROUND IT IS A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT SORT OF EFFORT. YOU HAVE DEPRECIATE THAT SHOULD SERVE IN WITH RESPECT TO THE THIS IS A ONE TIME GRANT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW FAR THAT GOES. WHAT'S A TYPICAL INCREMENT OF ALLOCATION AND WHAT IS. YOUR WITHIN THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MILLION AND. WHAT WHAT A COMMUNITY CAN ONLY DO WITH THOSE FUNDS. SO OKAY GREAT QUESTION A LOT OF DEPENDS THE COMMUNITY AND- IT DEPENDS OF THE- SIZE AND SCOPE OF- CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE- OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE RIGHT A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS UP IS UP YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SIZE AND CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO OUR OUR OUR CITIES AND DISTRICTS- YOU KNOW. PARDON BIG PART OF THIS MONEY WILL NOT ONLY- REALLY BE FOCUSED ON BRINGING TOGETHER ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES I THINK IT'S UP HELPING COMMUNITIES TO- TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING TOGETHER THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AROUND THE RESILIENCY ROUNDTABLE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD GET US SEED MONEY TO GET COMMUNITY STARTED BASED UPON ASSISTANCE FROM- YES AND OUR STATE FAMILY- AND THEN. WE WORKING WITH THEM AND THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE ROUNDTABLE THAT WOULD HELP FIND LEVERAGE MANY OTHER SOURCES OF GRANT FUNDING THERE ARE STE FEDERAL HAZARD MITIGATION GRANTS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED MULTIPLE OTHER KINDS OF RESILIENCY GRANTS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO PLUGIN THE A MERICAN REPORT RESCUE ACT PROPOSES ANOTHER KIND OF THE HOUSING MITIGATION GRANT INFRASTRUCTURE WORK FEMA HAS NOW PROPOSED BRICK WHICH IS A BUILDING DISASTER. RESILIENT COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE. EITHER ALL CREATED. IN AND SO- REALLY IT'S NEW- EFFORT THAT CENTER DRIVES ALL OF THAT AND MAXIMIZES MONEY COMING INTO LOCAL COMMUNITY. BUILDING RESILIENCY BASED UPON A SET OF METRICS THAT WE WILL WORK WITH THAT COMMUNITY- TO IMPLEMENT SO IT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S ALL IT'S ONE YEAR- IT'S FOR- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW IT'S ONLY GOING TO GO SO FAR SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF YOU WANT TO REALLY. AMPLIFY THAT BY BUILDING CAPACITY. AND THEN LEVERAGING THAT CAPACITY TO BRING AN ADDITIONAL FIVE DOLLARS BASED UPON METRICS SO YOU JUST LAST FOLLOW UP ON THAT SHOW SO IF THERE ARE. JUST OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA- NOT ALL OF THEM ARE. YES YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED IS THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUS LOCATIONS FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF TESTERS HOW MANY CITIES JUST ROUGHLY. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MONEY COULD BE SPREAD. OUT TO ASSIST THEM WITH THIS SORT OF PREPARATION. SO SIR I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME FOR THAT BUT I SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING AND YOU KNOW THE ISSUE IS THAT. MAYBE IT IN A ROOM IN A REGION MAYBE IT'S A- YOU KNOW AN AREA WHERE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME CITIES THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA WANT TO FOCUS ON CITIES THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT UNDERSERVED AND UP AB LAST RESOURCE. THERE MAY BE OTHER CITIES THERE IS FAR AS HOW MUCH MONEY YEAH YEAH YOU GET IT GETS DOLED OUT WE ALSO WILL LOOK AT. MAYBE YOU HAVE A SERIES OF THREE OR FOUR CITIES THAT ARE VERY SMALL RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS THEY CONSENTED TRIES THAT WE KNOW THAT AS A AS AN INDIVIDUAL CITY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT IF THE IF THEY CAN MATCH THAT THEY CAN COMBINE. THE THREE CITIES THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH AYE I THINK ABOUT THE PENINSULA SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY. WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW MULTIPLE SMALL COMMUNITIES ARE DOWN ALONG. THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY LOS ANGELES WE'VE GOT THE SMALLER CITIES THAT COULD COME TOGETHER AND COMBINE RESOURCES AND WE CAN PROVIDE GRANTS TO HELP AMPLIFY. THAT AFTER A GET THEM STARTED SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS WE'RE NOT. THAT'S NOT FULLY VETTED OUT YET- AND YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT I JUST KNOW THAT FROM. DEVELOPING SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN THE PAST OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO GO AROUND TO REALLY GET EVERYBODY WHAT WE NEED TO BUT THERE'S A WAY TO- LEVERAGE UP VARIOUS SOURCES OF FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO MEET A BASELINE LEVEL OF METRIC. ENJOY PROJECT THAT'S RIGHT SO I ASSUMED IT YOU COULD PROBABLY CREATE A MATRIX THAT IDENTIFIES. CITIES BY TYPES OF HAZARD AND ALSO BY LEVELS OF NEED- AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT WOULD BE SUCH A I THINK IT WOULD IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE WORTH DOING- WITH AN EYE TOWARD THIS ALLOCATION. BOB. SO DO APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR. GREAT QUESTION CENTERED ON NEWMAN I AM. WHAT IS TO EXTENT. OF HAS BEEN EXPERIENCE- IS ON DOING THE OUT REACH AND UP TO THE VARIOUS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE LEAST DOES PROGRAMMER OR NEW AS YOU'RE PROPOSING UNDER THIS OF- REQUEST OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO BUILD ON. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE OR WHAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE TO DATE. WELL ON THE ON THE ON THE LEGAL SIDE OF THINGS- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BUILT A GREAT FOUNDATION- YOU KNOW- I SAY MEASURE EARLIER- WE'VE REACHED- AND ACTUALLY IF IT SERVED OVER OVER FORTY NINE COUNTIES OVER THE LAST. YEAR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EFFORT- FUNDING OVER THREE HUNDRED SOME SMALLER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. WHO ARE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS WE ENGAGE WITH THAT CONSULATE'S OFFICE SUPPORT MISSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH- WITHOUT. REPRESENTED DEMOGRAPHICS A BIT BETTER IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAKE UP THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA BOB TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- DISASTER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION- THROUGH CAL POLY TEARS. UP WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUSH OUT MONEY FOR BUILDING SEARCH AND FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. AND ENHANCING AMERICORPS. THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE LEAST THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE AMPLIFIED THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT AS WELL- THROUGH THE DISASTER RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE. M. IN IN CAL CAL WE ASK FOR WORKING WITH JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TO. IMPLEMENT HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS THESE PROJECTS ARE ALL HAZARD- THEY RANGE FROM EVERYWHERE FROM FLOOD MITIGATION PROJECTS THE WILDFIRE DECIDED RETROFITTING- TO LAND. A SLIGHT DOUBT PROTECTION- CHIU NOT. MAPPING OUR LIST GOES ON AND THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT- THESE ARE ALL VERY POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AND THEY DO BUILD A BASELINE FOR US TO. START FROM THEY ALSO PROVIDE. MY SURE THAT THEY COME INTO THE TO THE- YES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON. WHAT I WHAT I CAN TELL YOU AS A C. AS THE- YESTER ACTOR IN MULTIPLE DISASTERS OVER THE COURSE OF. THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS. IT'S NOT. THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY TO THE DEGREE ARE TO BUILD A RESILIENT CALIFORNIA TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GOING AND RESPONDING TO A DISASTER WHEN DISASTER OCCURS. OR MULTIPLE DISASTERS OCCUR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THAT BOTH. OPERATIONALLY BUT ALSO. ECONOMICALLY AND THEN NO. WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE THAT THEY NEED. TO BE ABLE TO. RAPIDLY RECOVER FROM THAT DISASTER SO- YES I SPENT A LOT MORE TIME. RESPONDING IN AND WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- WE JUST SEE THESE GAPS EXIST SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO. BUILD ON ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE A STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. ARE THAT EVERY JURISDICTION IS IT'S IN STATUTE AND- BY LAW BE JURISDICTION OPERATES FROM SO WE'VE GOT ORGANIZATIONAL CONSTRUCT. WE'VE GOT MEDICATION PROGRAMS WEAVERVILLE REQUIREMENT FOR HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EVERY COMMUNITY HAS TO HAVE A- LOCAL HAS RECOGNITION PLAN TO BE ABLE TO GET DISASTER EIGHT THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT- AND- AND WE'VE GOT THESE- WE'VE WE'VE GOT THIS- ENGAGEMENT THAT'S HAPPENING. DAY TODAY BETWEEN OUR REGIONAL STAFF AND- YES HEADQUARTERS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMUNITIES AT THAT FIRE AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. NOW IT'S LIKE. WE NEED TO PULL THIS ALL TOGETHER AND BUILD THIS FOUNDATION STATEWIDE- THE BILL THE RESULTS. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION SIR. GOOD CENTER I'M GOOD AT. GOOD IT JUST AND IT'S NOT A- QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OT TO COMMUNITIES THAT EITHER HAVE ALREADY BEEN. TOUCHED BY THE SERVICES OR WHO NEED TO BE. OUR PROVIDED SERVICES AND WE NEED TO OUT REACH- SO I THINK IT IN THAT SENSE IT'S REALLY. GOOD I THINK THE- IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW FOR US OF WHICH ARE THE COUNTIES WERE THIS IS ACTUALLY BEEN DONE WORD IT'S ACTUALLY WORKED. THERE'S YOU SAID THREE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE THEY I THINK THE LEGISLATORS WOULD ALL WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT. AND ALSO TO HELP IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN AND WHETHER WE- WHETHER WE ARE IN FOR EXAMPLE. LEGISLATORS ARE FROM AND THE VARIOUS DIVERSITY CAUCUSES OR WE REPRESENT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE. I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO REPORT BACK OR HAVE A MECHANISM- TO LET US KNOW WHERE AND HOW THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED SO AGAIN WE COULD- ASSIST WE COULD FILL GAPS- WE KNOW THAT IN DURING THE CALL WITH NINETEEN- FOR TESTING FOR THE ACTUAL VACCINATIONS WE WORKED HARD IN THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES- TO RECOMMEND WHERE- IN OUR VARIOUS DISTRICTS THOSE SERVICES SHOULD BE PROVIDED SO. AT SOME POINT I THINK IT WOULD BE THAT SHOULD BE BUILT IN ARE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S EIGHTY D. WE FEEL IT WHETHER IT'S A FIRE HAZARD WE FEEL IT- AND ESPECIALLY A FUND LIKE THIS THAT WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY TO BE USED TO ASSIST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THAT KIND OF. WITH YOU KNOW OUTREACH- AND FORMAL OUTREACH I THINK WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING TO DO THANK YOU CAN I ADD SOMETHING ON CHURCH I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY AWARE OF THE HAZARDS- THAT ARE PRESENT UNTIL IT IS ASTERS CHAU THERE'S PROBABLY AN ITERATIVE PROCESS HERE- WE ENSURING INFORMATION FROM THE COX'S BROSSEAU FROM. I THINK FROM- YES I DO I FIND CONSERVE HAZARDS. THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO PRESENT THEMSELVES- I THINK IT- FOR- YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO AGAIN AND REALLY APPRECIATE- YOU BEING HERE THANK YOU MR. COLOR DUTY THEY SAY THAT YOU HAVE CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS OKAY NOW WE'VE MOVED ON FROM IT C. THIS ISSUE WILL ALSO BE HELD OPEN WE MOVE ON TO JUDICIAL BRANCH. AND- THAT'S ISSUES FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER PHILLIPS. IN HIS SHOES. FOR OKAY. WELCOME MR DR FRANCIS OF WE'LL START WITH ISSUE FOUR AND WILL THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PLEASE PRESENT. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS LIKE COOKING GARBAGE FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I'M HERE TO PROVIDE- AN OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE NINE ISSUES ARE PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA AS- DISCUSSED WITH DR FRANCIS. I'LL GO THROUGH THE DESCRIPTION WE DO HAVE- STAFF AND EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ON THE ISSUES AND I'M SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBING AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ITEMS AND YOUR GENDER. SO FIRST WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS ITEMS. THE FIRST IS A REVISION PROPOSAL FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT EARLY DISPOSITION READING THIS CONFERENCE PROGRAM. THIS PROPOSAL BILLS ON A PROGRAM INITIATED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN RESPONSE TO THE CODE NINETEEN RELATED DELAYS. IN CRIMINAL CASE PROCESSING. MAKING TEMPORARY ASSIGNED JUDGES AVAILABLE TO COMPETE COMPLETE READINESS CONFERENCES TO RESOLVE LOW LEVEL MISDEMEANOR. OR FELONY CASES BEFORE THEY GO TO TRIAL. NEXT ITEM IS WITHIN THAT IS OF THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING UP TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS THE COURT'S CASE OF BACK OFFICE THIS FUNDING WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCED UPON REVIEW OF THEIR DATA DEMONSTRATING A PERSISTENT CASE BACKLOG. COULD BE USED TO PROCURE RESOURCES SUCH AS ADDITIONALSTAFF OR SPACE TO PROCESS CASES. ONE ITEM NUMBER TWO THE FINES AND FEES ON A SHIP. THE MAIN REVISION INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT A DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM TO ELIMINATE DEBT. OWED ON EXISTING FINES AND FEES FOR TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC INFRACTION TICKETS ISSUED BETWEEN JANUARY. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNDER THIS PROGRAM I LO INCOME INDIVIDUAL COULD APPLY TO HAVE A 100% OF THEIR DEBT FORGIVENESS GIVEN UPON SUBMISSION OF AN APPLICATION VERIFYING THEIR LOW INCOME STATUS. NUMBER THREE IS- RELATED TO- PRE TRIAL DETENTION FUNDING. YOU MAY RECALL THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED BUNCH BILL LANGUAGE OUTLINING THE FREE TRIAL DECISION MAKING PILOT IN THE COMING THAT LANGUAGE WAS A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO THE JOINT COUNCIL TO FIND. IMPLEMENTATION OPERATION THE VALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S OUR EFFORTS AT LEAST TEN COURTS WITHIN A PRE TRIAL DECISION MAKING. BUILDING UPON THAT THE MERE REVISION INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO EXPAND A PRE TRIAL POWER PROGRAMS FUNDED FROM THE ONE TIME RESOURCES IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUDGET ACT. IN FINAL ITEM THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IS NUMBER FIVE THE LEGAL AGE FOR RENTERS AND LANDLORDS TENANTS DISPUTES. BE REVISION INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THREE YEARS A TOTAL OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS. AVOID EVICTIONS FORECLOSURES. SAID THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE PRESENTING AT THE MOMENT. WE DO HAVE STAFF AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AS YOU MAY HAVE THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY WE HAVE THE- KALLIO. COMMENTS. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE COMMENTS ON FOUR OF THE ITEMS BEFORE YOU COINCIDENTALLY THEY ARE ITEMS ONE THROUGH FOUR AS LISTED ON YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE EIGHT- THIS IS STARTING WITH THE FIRST ITEM WE DO OUR COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE FOR- AT LEAST SIXTY MILLION EACH FOR CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASE BACKLOGS AND SO ON THAT ONE WE'RE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING REJECTING THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE AND THERE IS A PROCESS OUTLINED IN NINETEEN FORTY OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE PROGRAMS TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR UNANTICIPATED AND NECESSARY EXPENSES. WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT AS PART OF THAT PROCESS- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF THE AMOUNT NEEDED EXENE SORT OF WHAT IS ALREADY SET ASIDE IN NINETEEN FORTY- THERE IS A PROCESS FOR OBTAINING MORE MONEY SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING THIS LANGUAGE WE DO RECOMMEND OF MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS IN TWO WAYS THE FIRST IS WE RECOMMEND- MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW THE FUNDING MAY BE USED I'M FOR EXAMPLE LIMITING IT TO CERTAIN CASE TYPES ARE CERTAIN PROCEEDING TYPES. OR IF IT'S KIND OF A STATE WIDE TARGETED EFFORT- SIMILAR TO THE EARLY DISPOSITION READINESS CONFERENCE PROGRAM WHICH IS FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ARE PRESENT ON THE SECOND- MODIFICATION IS WE WOULD RECOMMEND MODIFYING IT TO INCLUDE WHAT INFORMATION MUST BE PROVIDED TO JUSTIFY THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING-SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER REQUIRE INFORMATION ON A STATE WIDE BACKLOG- WHAT PARTICULAR ACTIONS- INDIVIDUAL TRIAL COURTS HAVE TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE BACKLOGS AND HOW AND HOW THE PROVIDED FUNDING WOULD. BE ALLOCATED AND USE. I'M TO ISSUE TO THE FINANCE ITEM OR YOUR REGION- WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT WE KERN DON'T HAVE THE TRUE BILL. FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE TIME AT THIS TIME WE DO FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL MERRICK'S LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS IT WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN AND THOSE INCLUDE WHAT HAPPENS OF THE PARTITION PARTICIPATION RATE IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RESULTING IN A LARGER REDUCTION IN FINANCE THE REVENUE THAN IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED. HOW MUCH FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND OUTRAGE COSTS. HOW IN THE BACKFIELD TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE DISTRIBUTED AND HOW THE PROGRAM OPERATES IN TANDEM WITH THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL TO EXPAND ONLINE EDUCATION OF INFRACTIONS AS WELL AS ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION STATEWIDE. AND THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH THE PROGRAM AGAINST OTHER PRIORITIES AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS STRUCTURED AND OPERATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT. WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND EXPECTATIONS. AND SO FINALLY ON THIS ITEM WE WILL NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF REVENUE REDUCTIONS ON OTHER STATE FUNDS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THIS TYPE OF ROMANIA. BECAUSE BACK FEELS FOR THEM ARE NOT PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT BEING SAID THE LEGISLATURE HAS VARIOUS. OPTIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS IT. MOVING TO THREE- AND THE PRIEST OF THE TRIAL THE- PROPOSAL- WE DO FIND THE PROPOSAL MERITS CONSIDERATION AS IT PROVIDES RELIEF TO LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. WHO MAY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING BAIL AND GIVEN A RECENT COURT RULING THAT WOULD INCREASE THE NEED- FOR PRE TRIAL SERVICES. HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MODIFYING THE PROPOSED BUDGET LANGUAGE IN A FIVE WAY. THE FIRST IS- THE CAR PROPOSAL ALLOCATE FUNDING TO THE TRIAL COURTS BASED ON EACH COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE STATE'S POPULATION OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND MARC CONSIDER MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE. TO ALLOCATE FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOURTHS IN THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS. USING ALTERNATIVE OR ADDITIONAL METRICS SUCH AS CRIMINAL FILINGS TO ENSURE FUNDING ONE MORE CLOSELY MATCHED POTENTIAL WORKLOAD FOR EACH COUNTY. A MODIFICATION IS- TO REQUIRED DETAILS ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON EXPENDITURES AND KEY OUTCOME DATA OVER THIS AREA. TO INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS BEING USED ACCOUNTABLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THE THIRD MODIFICATION IS TO SPECIFY THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MODIFY THE ALLOCATION FORMULA IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FISCAL YEAR BASED ON ADDITIONAL DATA THAT HAS BEEN RECEIVED AS WELL AS THE FIRST- REQUIRED A JUDICIAL COUNCIL EVALUATION OF PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND THIS COLLEGE- REYES. ADDITIONAL METRICS SUCH AS THE PERCENT OF PEOPLE RELEASED PRETRIAL RELATIVE TO FINDINGS WHICH MAYBE- A BETTER METHOD ARE BETTER METRIC FOR ALLOCATING THE FUNDING. THE FOURTH MODIFICATION- WE WOULD RECOMMEND IS PROVIDING COURTS FLEXIBILITY TO CONTRACT WITH BEING ENTITY THAT IS BEST SUITED TO PROVIDE PRE TRIAL SERVICES RATHER THAN JUST PROBATION. AS THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT- THAT THERE ARE OTHERS THAT COULD PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND WE'RE CONTRACTING WITH THE ENTITY THAT IS BEST EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE IT. AND THE FINAL MODIFICATION IS TO REQUIRE THE EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF RACE AND OTHER FACTORS ON RELEASED DECISIONS TO HELP INFORM WHETHER FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NEEDED. AND THE FINAL- SET OF COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE IS AN ISSUE FOR ON YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS RELATED SHOE IN ONE TIME- IT ISN'T THE NEIGHBOR VISION INCREASE INCLUDES AN AUGMENTATION A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION- FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND SO ON THIS ITEM WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROVIDE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED BY THIS PARTICULAR AMOUNT. BEFORE ACTING ON THE PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SELECTED PROJECTS ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT FOR THE THIRTY MILLION THAT WAS PROPOSED AS PART OF THE JANUARY PROPOSAL- AS PART OF JANUARY BUDGET AND USUAL RANKING WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE THIRTY ONE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY- THAT. ALLOCATION OF FUNDING. SO THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU WESLEY- I GREW HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COMMENTS. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATUS JUSTIN EDELMAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN A RESPONSE IF THANK YOU THE L. A. AS ANNOUNCED ON ISSUE NUMBER READ IT THE TRIAL RELEASES- I'M THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO WORKING WITH THELEGISLATURE ON DETERMINING THE BEST FACTOR TO CONSIDER THE COUNTY NEEDS FOR THE- ALLOCATION OF THIS FUNDING WE FELT THAT THE SPECIFIED AGE RANGE APPROPRIATE DRESSED POTENTIAL PRE TRIAL RELEASE NEEDS. BUT ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONSIDER OTHER METRICS ARE COMBINATIONS AS RECOMMENDED- AND ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION AGREES THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S REPORTING AND- FINDINGS ON THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE ROBUST AND HAVE MEANINGFUL- AFTER WE KNOW THINGS EARNS THE SOME OF THE L. A. O. L. A- RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIED OUTCOME DATA IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL I. DEPENDING ON THE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE EVENTUALLY AN ALTERNATELY- INCLUDED WE KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MORE. RESOURCES WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THIS PROPOSAL- SPECIFICALLY TO FACILITATE SOME OF THE IN DEPTH- RECORDING PROCESS IS THAT SOUND MORE AKIN TO A DETAILED GRANT MANAGEMENT OR ACADEMIC STUDIES. AS THE RECOMMENDATION OF EXPANDING THE OPTION TO- CONTRACT TO NON PROBATION ENTITIES THAT APARTMENT CONSIDERED TO BE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THAT PRE TRIAL RELEASES SUPPORT ISSUE AND THAT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ULTIMATELY ANSWER TO THE COURTS I'M INFORMATION INVOLVES OTHER COUNTY- ENTITIES IN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HIS REHABILITATIVE OR COUNSELING SERVICES THAT'S ULTIMATELY OPTED THAT PROBATION DEPARTMENTS CHOICE I THIS PROPOSAL REGARDS PEOPLE'S LIBERTY AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS THE CORE FUNCTION AND NOT NECESSARILY A COUNTY FUNCTION. AS SUCH WE BELIEVE THAT COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE BEST SITUATED TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL- FOR THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUES I'LL TURN TO MY. COLLEAGUES I JUST WANT. OKAY GO AHEAD. HI GOOD MORNING JESSE REMIND APARTMENTS FINANCE IN REGARDS STUDENTS CAN DRESS A COUPLE ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY MISLI I IN REGARDS TO PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE ALLOWING THAT YOU SHOULD COUNCIL TO REQUEST RESOURCES FOR THAT WE'RE BACK LARGEST ONE READER EIGHT OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT JUDICIAL BRANCHES HAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OPERATIONS TO CHANGE THE ARTWORK IN THE SPREAD OF CORONER AND TEEN THESE CHANGES HAVE DELAYED NORMAL CORE OPERATIONS THAT RESULTED IN A LOT OF. CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASES I THIS THIS PREVAILING WHICH PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG OF THESE CASES I'M INTERESTED LEN RECOMMENDATION TO REJECT THIS LANGUAGE JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER TO REJECT I'M SORRY SIR JACK THIS LANGUAGE IN THE STATE OF THE FUNDING COULD BE REQUESTED TO BE NINETY FORTY UNANTICIPATED COST REQUEST PROCESS WE JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT DO NOT CONSIDER THESE COSTS TO BE ON ANTICIPATED SO THEREFORE NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NINETY FOUR YEAR PROCESS TO HOUSTON WILL. THIS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE I'M IN REGARDS TO AND WE HAVE ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION ON THIS REQUEST ON BY LIMITING THE USE OF THIS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CASE TYPE IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT SUPERIOR COURT BACKLOGS COULD GARY BY KEY STEP IN RESTRICTIONS IT'S FUNDING CUTTING HIM IN PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS. THEIR BACKLOGS. I'M IN REGARD TO THE- EYE DOCTOR. FROM JUST ONE HIGHLIGHTED IN THAT THIS DEBT FORGIVEN PROGRAM PROVIDE. FINANCIAL FOR LOW COMMITTEE. LOW INCOME. THROUGH THE ELIMINATION DEBT- DON'T EXIST FIND FEES. TRAFFIC IN NON TRAFFIC IN. TO GET ISSUED. JANUARY FOR TWENTY FIFTH ENGINE TWO TWENTY ONE. GIVEN THE BURDEN FINE PIECES OR HAVING. VISUALS THERE'S OF URGENCY PROVIDE THE STREET IN. NEEDED THEM. I'M IN. OF FIVE BY THE A- THEY'RE STILL STERN COMPONENTS OF THIS BUT- THAT WE WILL BE WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WILL FORWARD TO WORKING WITH BUT THE LEGISLATURE IN JUDICIAL. POTENTIAL THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU AND WHAT KNOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OKAY YOU CAN US. GO AHEAD FULLER NAY I SIR I DO HAVE A AND A NUMBER OF FIVE THE FIVE FEES- PROBABLY I GUESS READ THE JUDICIAL CARE. WELL HOW DO YOU ENJOY- MAKING THE FOLKS WHO. ARE IN A AND FEES MAKING THEM AWARE OF THE PROGRAM WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE MECHANICS- TO GET- SOME OF. THE PUBLICIZES THE SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE SOME ASSURANCE- THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM AND ARE. INCLINED TO APPLY. GOOD MORNING- SENATORS- I'M SHELLEY KERN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSOLE JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE- AT THE BRITISH COUNCIL I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. HIGHER IN THE STUDENT LEGISLATION- WE HAVE HAVE DONE OUTRAGE YOU WEBSITES AND- DMB THIS TIME- IN ORDER TO ENHANCE OUR REGION TO REALLY REACH PEOPLE WHO- WE HOPE WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. WE ANTICIPATE WORKING WITH WITH VARIOUS- NONPROFIT'S LEGAL SERVICES AGENCIES TO TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT THROUGH THEM IN ORDER TO REALLY EXPAND THE NET FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BECOME AWARE OF THIS PROGRAM AND THEREFORE BENEFIT FROM IT. IT SHOULD IT'S SO WEIRD I THINK A REALLY INTERESTING CONVERSATION I GUESS IT WAS LAST WEEK. ABOUT THIS VERY SUBJECT AND- HE DID JUST DO YOU ENVISION MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN. OF FINES AND FEES ROAD AND LAST WEEK'S DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT THE- SERVE BURDENS OF THESIS AND SERVE A PRIVATE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT BUT- HOW IT WORKS RIGHT SO YOU'LL FIND AT LEAST INFERIOR TO SERVE A PURPOSE THE PURPOSE WOULD BE DETERRENCE FROM. THAT AND THE FEAST IT WOULD YOU MAKE IT IS DANGEROUS TO SIMPLY THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT- WE KIND OF AS A BLANKET MATTER- AS TO HOW MUCH SOMEBODY OWN. FOR THAT DEBT RELIEF PROPOSAL THAT YOU ALL ARE CONSIDERING TODAY IT'S A 100% RELIEF FROM THE FINES AND FEES FROM THE TOTAL AMOUNT DUE INCLUDING SEVERAL ASSESSMENTS. ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM WHICH IS THE PROSPECT OF A PROGRAM THAT IS ALSO A BOOKLET THAT IS LINKED TO THIS. PROPOSAL AND IS THE PROST BECTIVE. PROPOSAL THAT ONE ALSO CONSIDERS THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DUE- FROM. THE INDIVIDUAL AND AGAIN IT REALLY IS A MATTER OF MAKING SURE. THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD THESE FINES AND FEES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDED ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO OPPOSED TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. BUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE- RECEIVE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED AND ARE NOT BURDEN FOR A LONG TIME- FIVE FIVE THIS THAT. I JUST MIGHT OWNER SO WITH RESPECT TO. VERIFY LOW INCOME STATUS WHAT IS THERE A SLIDING SCALE SOME SHORT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE- THROUGH THE BASELINE AND HOW IT WORK IS AS IT RELATES TO. THE CALCULATIONS DOWN SMEBODY MIGHT KNOW. YEAH THE DEFINITION THAT'S THAT THAT'S BEEN USED- IN THE ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM WE'RE STILL AS AS WAS MENTIONED BY MISS THE AND IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING- POTENTIAL TRAILER BILL- FOR YOU TO WHILE TO CONSIDER- THE LANGUAGE IS USED IN A TV IS A HUNDRED AND LINE. FOR A RECIPIENT OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BENEFITS IN THE WAY THAT IT WORKS- IN IN ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM IS- INDIVIDUALS- CAN UPLOAD INFORMATION AND SAY- THAT THEY OR AND WE'RE WORKING ON LINKING TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- IN PRIOR INDUSTRY PROGRAMS THE WAY THAT. WORK IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TESTIFIED- UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THEY ARE LOW INCOME THEY DO MEET THE STANDARDS. APPRECIATE THAT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MEASURE. THANK YOU- YES I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. ON UP. FULLY TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- IN GOING BACK TO YOUR ALLOCATING. FUNDS TO THE COURT BASED ON EACH COUNTY'S. PROPORTION OF STATE POPULATION EIGHT EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE. I THINK THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE OUR RESPONSE TO THIS BUT WHY IS THAT AT THE- TARGETED AGE GROUP. AND WHY IS THAT AGE GROUP ARE USED OVER ARRESTS AND FILING. THIS IS SHELLY CURRENT WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST REITERATE- WHAT WHAT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTION AND THAT IS WE DEVELOP THAT WE SUGGESTED ORIGINALLY THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE- POPULATION BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY READILY AVAILABLE- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO. WORK WITH WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AND OF COURSE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO CHANGE THAT FORMULA THAT'S THE DESIRE. OKAY WITH REGARDS TO THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE COURTS TO ADDRESS CRIMINAL AND THE CIVIL BACKLOG. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE OUR RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT'S EQUITABLE TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG OF. AND WHAT'S THE SPLIT BETWEEN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASES ON THE SIXTY MILLION- AND IZZARD PRIVATIZATION OF THE CASES. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE- THIS IS LIKE COMPUTER MACHINERY HAVE NANCY EVERHART ON WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE COURT EXECUTIVES VISOR COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT TO YOUR QUESTIONS CONTRARILY NANCY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS NANCY EVERHART CEO FROM SAN BERNARDINO SUPERIOR COURT ASK YOUR QUESTIONS- AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE RESOURCES WE HAVE DATA FROM THE LAST YEAR THAT DOES DEMONSTRATE TO US THE BACKLOG EACH COURT HAS SEEN. IN MANY CASE TYPES NOT JUST- CRIMINAL OR NOT JUST A IN CIVIL BUT ACTUALLY ACROSS MANY CUT CASE TYPES ANDWE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING UPDATED DATA THAT COMPARES OUR PROGRESS OVER THE LAST YEAR SINCE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE SOME RESTRICTIONS- AND SHOWING US WHAT THE OUTSTANDING BACKLOG IS. THAT THE COURT WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE REQUESTS FOR THE FUNDING IF IT'S A IF IT'S APPROVED BASED UPON THEIR NEED AND THEIR STATED ACTUAL PLAN FOR REDUCING THOSE BACKLOGS SO THAT'LL GIVE US A MEASURE MEANT. AS TO THE SPLIT BETWEEN pARE SEEING ABOUT A 20% MORE BACKLOG IN CRIMINAL CASES HOWEVER WE DO HAVE. THE THE DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT IS STATED WITHIN YOUR MAY REVISED- AND SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT TO. TO HELP US WITH EARLY DISPOSITION ON THAT CALENDAR WE'RE NOT PLANNING ON SETTING ASIDE A SPECIFIC PORTION OF FUNDING FOR. FOR JUST A VERY S. I'M SORRY FOR SPECIFIC CASE TYPE. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE SEEING BACKLOGS AGAINST ALL CASE TYPES. AND THERE'S THE PRIORITIZATION AGAIN- WE'RE LOOKING AT- SUSTAINED FUNDING- TO HELP US WITH THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THE VARIOUS CASE TYPES IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. SO JUST AS A FOLLOW UP IS THAT MEAN IT'S UP TO EACH COURT- WHO DECIDES THE PRIORITIZATION AND ON THE SPLIT HOW THE MONEY WILL BE USED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR EACH COURT IS EXPERIENCING- BACKLOGS IN DIFFERENT AREAS BASED ON A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS- THE ABILITY OF FACILITIES TO HAVE PEOPLE COME INTO THEM- JURY TRIALS. MAYBE STAFF AND LACK OF STAFFING IN AREAS EVEN PROCESS FILINGS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT PER COUNTY THE IDEA IS THAT THE TRIAL COURTS WOULD APPLY TO THE- JUDICIAL COUNCIL INDICATING THEIR NEED AND WITH MEASURE MONTHS ON HOW THE BACKLOG WOULD BE REDUCED. SO OFTEN IN THE FINAL DECISION IS MADE BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL NOT INDIVIDUAL COUNTY'S COURTS. THERE WOULD BE AN ABILITY TO APPLY BY THE TRIAL COURTS BUT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD BE THE ONE WHO WOULD BE ALLOCATING THE FUNDS. MATANCERA STILL ARE THIS IS LIKE WITH YOUR WHICH IS STILL ARE GATHERING OF INFORMATION OR JUSTIFICATION- TO THE- DEPARTMENT FIND IT'S ALSO GOING TO LEGISLATURE WILL BE ASSESSING WHAT ARE THE BACKLOGS THE SCOPE OF THE BACKLOGS. WHERE THE BACKLOGS AND ARE IN A CROSS THE STATE OF THE CITY TYPE OF CASES. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE ARE IN FUSION A SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS DUE TO ADDRESS THOSE- DOES BACKLOG SO IT IS PART OF OUR DATA GATHERING TO DETERMINE. THE NEED AND WE DO HAVE BROUGH YOUNG I'M ON THE LINE IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN TERMS OF ANY DATA. DATA POINTS SO YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS. YES I JUST WANNA. YOU KNOW GET BACK FROM YOU. WHERE YOU GOING WITH THAT- IN A WHERE DO WE THINK WE'RE GONNA END UP AND HOW DO WE GET. HOW DO WE THAT LEGISLATORS GET- YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GIVE FEEDBACK ON THAT. BECAUSE THAT- I COULD SEE IF IT'S JUST COR BY COURT ORDER IT THE COURTS MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF GUIDELINES ON THAT'S I'M TRYING TO GET AND WHERE DO WE GET THE- REWARD WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHIME IN. ABSOLUTELY AND AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT ARE I REQUEST YOU TO FINANCE IS A UPON THEIR APPROVAL- SUBMISSIONS ARE LEGISLATURE PER REVIEW PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION OF THEM FUNDS BACK TO THE BRANCH SO YOU HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY LONG OKAY SUBMIT THE REPORT TO ALTHOUGH THE PROPERTIES COMMITTEES GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH REGARDS TO THE- FINES AND FEES. RELEASE- WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO DO COMMUNITY OUTREACH. WITH REGARDS TO THE YOU KNOW THE COMING OUT WHICH TO THE AREAS THAT WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE PROPOSAL. I THINK CENTER NEWMAN. TOUCHED ON THAT BUT IF YOU COULD EXPAND THAT. SURE- MADAM CHAIR SHELLEY CURRENT WITH WITH- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OUR HOPE THIS TIME IS TO- DO A MORE EXPANSIVE OUTREACH TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE REACHING COMMUNITIES WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY- THESE FINES AND FEES AND SO TO THAT END- WE HOPE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH- LEGAL SERVICES AGENCIES AND OTHER NONPROFITS PEOPLE WHO HAVE REGULAR CONTACT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BURDENED BY THESE FINES AND FEES IN ORDER TO- BRING THEM INTO THE SYSTEM AND- AND- MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS REALLY IMPORTANT LEAVE. OKAY THE BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN OR- LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS- HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU DO THAT. WHAT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THAT YET MANAGER OKAY- AND WITH REGARDS TO THE RELIEF SPAN IT'S FIVE YEARS- WHAT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE- HOW YOU FIGURE. THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE DEBT PRIOR TO TWENTY FOURTEEN LIKE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM RETHINKING ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM OR THEY JUST. LOST LET YOU KNOW MISS THE CUT OFF. YES YOUR MIND FROM THE CLINICS ON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. AND IN REGARDS TO THE HERE HERE FOR YOU TWENTY FOUR. THE DEBT FORGIVENESS. FOR GRAHAM WAS MEANT TO BUILD OFF PRIOR PROGRAMS THAT WERE INTENDED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS DEBT FORGIVENESS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE. THE YEAR YOU'VE REFERENCED TO ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO BE ELIGIBLE AS WELL- IT WOULD INCREASE THE FISCAL IMPACT FOR THIS PROPOSAL ADAM WE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE KIND. STATION ARE IN C. R. IS HE OF TO SQUARE FISCAL IMPACT OF EXPANDING INTO BRITAIN'S PROGRAM- QUALIFYING TIME PERIOD OKAY. IT IT IS A MUCH HIGHER AMOUNTS OF THAT THAT'S OUT THERE AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER SO I MEAN I% GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR FUNDING TO AND WHAT POINT. DO YOU TREAT THAT DATA IS UNCOLLECTIBLE- IF AT ALL. IF YOU KNOW IF THIS WERE CONSUMER BUSINESSES EMPLOY YOU YOU CAN CALL THAT I COLLECTED THAT- SO HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT. EARLIER THAN SAY TWENTY FIFTEEN. IS IT STILL PRESUME THAT IT'S COLLECTIBLE AND TO PEOPLE STILL MAKE BUDGET PLANS AGAINST IT. OR DOES IT GET USED AGAINST THEM. YEAH I MEAN IT'S A GIVEN. DEFER TO MY COLLEGE EDUCATION COUNCIL FOR ON THE SPECIFICS AS- AS FAR AS WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED COLLECTIBLE ON PRIOR TO THAT DATE. IT IS LIKE A DIRECTION THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AGAIN- IT IS UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY AND PROGRAM TO DETERMINE COLLECTABILITY NON COLLECTIBILITY- WE DO PROVIDE GUIDELINES BUT THERE'S NOTHING- SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF DURATION AN AGENT THAT. YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE BUSINESSES TO USE CERTAIN METRICS BETTER. THIS AGAIN THIS IS A LOCAL DECISION. WE DO ENCOURAGE THEM TO ASSESS THE H. COLLECTABILITY THE DEBT. BUT IT IS A LOCAL DETERMINATION. AND SO WE DEFER TO THEIR DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE DEBTORS IS A COLLECTIBLE ARE NOT THAT CLOSE IT WOULD BE SOME PORTION THAT IS EFFECTIVELY NOT CLICKABLE AND NOAH. THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL COUNSEL TO THE PROGRAMS. BUT AGAIN IT'S THEIR DECISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE THAT PROCESS SO ISSUE I THINK IT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING AND- AND POSSIBLY HELPFUL IS THERE ANY. IS THERE A BASIS FOR GIVING US SOME SENSE OF- BOTH THE AGGREGATE LEVEL OF UNCOLLECTED FINES AND FEES ACROSS STATEMENT. AT LOOKING AT THAT ON A MORE LOCAL BASIS- BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T REALLY OF REALLY HAD. A BASS LINE AT THIS POINT- FRAME REFERENCE WENT. OUR MOST RECENT SERVICES AGAINST GUARDS OUR MOST RECENT. COLLECTIONS BORDERS IDENTIFY OVER. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF. OUTSTANDING DEBT ONE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME YOU HAD A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. OF THE ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN UNCOLLECTIBLE DEBT BECAUSE PROGRAMS DID DISCHARGED. THE COLLECTABILITY SHARON'S ON THEIR OWN FROM THEIR BOOKS SO HAS BEEN PROGRESS MADE BUT THERE STILL IS ALREADY KNOWN AGAIN I SIGNED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM IN COUNTY ROUTES WITH THE OUTSTANDING DEBT THAT THEY HAVE WE CAN PROVIDE THAT ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL LIKE I THINK I. SPEAK FOR EVERYBODY WHEN I SAY ONE. THAT'S A LOT OF MIND. THANK YOU YEAH I MEAN WE ADDRESS THAT RIGHT WITH THE- THE FEES IN PRISONS JAILS AND PRISON FEES AND FOR SERVICES THAT WERE BEING RENDERED AND WE EVENTUALLY GOT RID OF ALL OF THAT- AND THEN JUST- COUPLE. QUESTIONS IS THERE AN IN PERSON WAY TO RECEIVE THE RELIEF BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT IT SAID. THE QUALIFICATION WAS YOU DID IT ONLINE. ESPECIALLY CURRENT WITH THOSE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- SIMILAR TO THE EIGHTY P. PROGRAM- WE ANTICIPATE THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO BOTH USE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS BENEFIT AND THEN ALSO FROM IN PERSON IF THAT'S IF THAT'S NECESSARY. IS THAT UP TO THE COURT TO DECIDE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE STATEWIDE. I IMAGINE AGAIN THE LANGUAGE HASN'T BEEN FINALIZED YET BUT IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WE ALLOW FOR STATEWIDE. AND FINALLY DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD WILL BE IMPACTED BY THIS. ALL RELIEF PROGRAM. BUT WE IMAGINE THAT- IF YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS THAT HAVE BANNED- ISSUED IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PERIOD- UNDER WHICH IS AVAILABLE AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN IT'S BASED ON A LOT A LOT ON ESTIMATIONS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE ANTICIPATE PROBABLY HAVE ALREADY PAID THEIR ENTIRE FIND IN FEET- THOSE WHO WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO IT AND THEN AND THEN ULTIMATELY THOSE WHO WILL QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY DO- THEY DO WITH THAT MEANS THAT THAT THE POVERTY THRESHOLD THAT'S GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATION WE IMAGINE THAT WILL BE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. INDIVIDUALS AGAIN AND THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WE CONSIDER WHEN WHERE AND WHERE I'M DOING THAT ANALYSIS IS THAT BASED UPON SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED CURRENTLY THROUGH OUR ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM- INDIVIDUALS HAVE ON AVERAGE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR TICKETS FOR INDIVIDUAL. OKAY ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT'S ALL- ANYMORE QUESTIONS AND YOU. KNOW WHAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS OPEN AND MOVE ON TO. ISSUE FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL. OF ISSUE FIVE IS ON THE CDC OURS OF THE REGION PROPOSALS AND ADJUSTMENTS AND SEE WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CBC ART TODAY.

WITH ME TODAY IS CHRIS CHAMBERS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH TO TALK ABOUT OUR SPRING PROJECTIONS. FOR INCARCERATED ADULT IN OUR JUVENILE WARD POPULATIONS SALTERTON OVER TO HIM. THANK YOU ERIC. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS CHRIS CHAMBERS ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CCRC OFFICE OF RESEARCH I'VE BEEN ASKED TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE ON CBC OUR SPRING TWENTY TWENTY ONE POPULATION PROJECTIONS. DESERVE MENTION TWICE EACH YEAR IN THE SPRING AND THE FALL OF OFFICE OF RESEARCH PREPARES POPULATION PROJECTIONS ON ADULT BJJ AND PAROLE SUPERVISION POPULATIONS. WHEN WE LOOK AT ADULT POPULATION IN ALL INSTITUTIONS POPULATION CD SEARCH POPULATION WAS NINE DOLLARS NINE. THE FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY INMATES AND APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS ABOUT TWO POINT 9% MORE INMATES DAM. ARE PROJECTED IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY POPULATION PROJECTIONS FOR THE SAME MONTH. THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE CDCR HIS RESUME INTAKE OF INDIVIDUAL SENTENCED TO PRISON. HOME REMAIN INTENDED JAILS AWAITING TRANSFER TO STATE PRISON. OFFICE OF RESEARCH ANTICIPATES THAT THIS YOUNG TECH WORKERS ROUGHLY THIRTY TWO HUNDRED OFFENDERS PER MONTH OR ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED PER WEEK THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR. EXPEDITED YET THINK WILL DRAW DOWN THE BACKLOG OF THE FENDERS FOR CDCR SENTENCES CURRENTLY AWAITING TRANSFER IN COUNTY JAILS. ONCE THE BACKLOG WHICH AS OF TWO DAYS AGO WAS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED HAS BEEN ADDRESSED INTAKE WILL RETURN TO CREATE PANDEMIC LEVELS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. THIS IS TYPICALLY SEVEN HUNDRED A WEEK FOR ABOUT TWENTY NINE HUNDRED A MONTH ON AVERAGE. WHEN LOOKING FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION OR EIGHTY P. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTION AND OVERALL EDP UP ONE TWENTY TWO. IN PROJECTIONS NOW ESTIMATED EIGHTY P. A HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE AN INCREASE OF NEARLY A THOUSAND. CDCR ANTICIPATES THAT DON'T INSTITUTION POPULATION WILL PEAK AT 1-001-300-0400 SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PM CRISCO YEARS TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. DECREASED 210-012-0008 HUNDRED FIFTY SIX EIGHTY P.

SOME SMALL IMPACT ON THE RATE OF RELEASE. THE SPRING POPULATION PROJECTIONS ALSO ACCOUNT FOR ONE TIME POSITIVE PROGRAMMING CREDIT FOR PPC A TWELVE WITH TWELVE WEEKS GRANTED TO OFFENDERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AS OF JULY NINTH TWENTY TWENTY. TPC CREDITS WERE APPLIED TO ELIGIBLE INMATES WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RULE VIOLATIONS BETWEEN MARCH FIRST AND JULY FIFTH OF TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN WE LOOK AT PRO POPULATION SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTION CDC EXPECTS THAT THE ACTIVE ADULT POPULATION. ACTOR PAROLE POPULATION WILL DECREASE AS IMPACTS OF UPDATED EARNED JUST CHARGE POLICY IN A PRO CAP APPLICATION THAT BECAME OPERATIONAL IN TWENTY TWENTY ARE REALIZED. KERN DISCHARGE POLICY ALLOWED ELIGIBLE PAROLEES WHO BEGAN THEIR PAROLE PERIOD PRIOR TO JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR POSSIBLE DISCHARGE NO LATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER RELEASE FROM PRISON. THE PAROLE CAL ALLOWS OFFENDERS RELEASED TO PAROLE ON OR AFTER JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO SERVE A MAXIMUM TWO YEAR PAROLE PERIOD AS LONG AS THEY ARE NON SEX REGISTRANT OR TO NINETY DETERMINEDLY SENTENCE PAROLEES. WERE THREE YEARS FOR THOSE WITH AN INNER INDETERMINATE SENTENCE.

OF THE POPULATION IS HIGHER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED DUE TO THE ACTUAL START DATE OF THE EARNED DISCHARGED POLICY REFLECTED IN THE PROJECTION. WAS JULY AND NOW HAS BEEN UPDATED TO OCTOBER. FOR THE REMAINING YEARS OF THE PRODUCTION CYCLE CDCR EXPECT ANNUAL DECREASES. WHAT POPULATION REACHING THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND. TWENTY THREE PAROLEES BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INET FIVE YEAR REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY POPULATION R. S. DJJ IS RELYING TO A LOCAL SYSTEMS PERCENT PERCENT NOW EIGHT TWENTY THREE C. STARK SPECS A TOTAL JUVENILE AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION WILL DECREASE. BY APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT 6% IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO REACH SEVEN HUNDRED YOUTH BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. THE POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE POINT 3% YOU REACH FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE YEARS BY JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AS WE LOOK AT CURRENT POINT IN TIME NUMBERS AS OF MAY EIGHTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE EJ'S TOTAL INTEREST SO THE POPULATION IS SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX.

OUR AND- WITH ME TODAY'S DUANE RIEDER WHO REPRESENTS OUR HEALTH CARE FISCAL SECTION WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS- WHEN WE CONCLUDE. OUR PRESENTATIONS. SO THAT'S FOR THAT ISSUE. THE NEXT ISSUE WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS- ISSUE SIX WHICH IS OUR DOORWAY BOTTLE ASSOCIATED PROPOSALS. THESE ARE TWO PROPOSALS GROUPED INTO WHAT WE ARE CALLING THE NORWAY MODEL NORWAY IS GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS MODEL CORRECTION SYSTEM DEMONSTRATED THROUGH ITS LOW RATE OF RECIDIVISM AND SUCCESSFUL POST RELEASE OUTCOMES NORWAY'S MODEL IS DISTINGUISHED BY THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE AND JOB SKILLS TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES. THE USE OF INNOVATIVE AND TRAUMA INFORMED WITH REHABILITATIVE PRACTICES AND THE CMMUNITY AND CAMPUS LIKE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT. MAY REVISION INCLUDES THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THREE MILLION ON GOING TO EXPAND PROGRAMMING AND UNDERTAKE FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. AT VALLEY STATE PRISON AND THIS PRISON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS STRIVE TO BE SORT OF A CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE. OF THE STORE WAY MODEL. ROSS IS SEEKING THIRTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUNDS TO REPLACE EXISTING METAL DAY ROOM FURNITURE. WITH MORE COMFORTABLE FURNITURE FOR POSITIVE PROGRAMMING AND NON DESIGNATED PROGRAM FACILITIES AND OUR FEMALE INSTITUTIONS. I WITH ME TODAY IS MARION SPEARMAN WHO'S GOING TO START OFF AND SERVE OUR SUPPORTERS STARTUP WITH MERION SPIRIT IN THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- VALLEY STATE PRISON. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAMEIS MERRY INSTRUMENT I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE GENERAL POPULATION MALE INSTITUTIONS AT CDC ARE. I WANT TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING TO CREATE A THERAPEUTIC SETTING AT VALLEY STATE PRISON DOWN AMID DATE BUT THAT MADERA CALIFORNIA. WERE INCARCERATED PERSONS CAN SERVE THEIR SENTENCES AND PRACTICE PROSOCIAL SKILLS IN A REHABILITATIVE ENVIRONMENT. SIMILAR TO THE OUTSIDE COMMUNITY. SO THREE OF MY TALK ABOUT- WE HAVE A REQUEST TO INSTALL BARBECUE GRILLS AND PATIO FURNITURE. AND TABLES ON IT AND IF THE VISITING PATIO AREA FOR INCARCERATED PERSONS NURSE FAMILIES TO SPEND QUALITY TIME TOGETHER TO FOSTER BONDS TO STRENGTHEN WELL THE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. ANOTHER ACTUAL BCP THAT HOBBY TALK ABOUT LATER IS THE FREQUENCY OF VISITING- IT'S PROVEN WE HAVE PEOPLE VISIT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IT PROVED TO REDUCE PRISON VIOLENCE STRENGTHEN FAMILY BONDS. BREAK INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLES OF INCARCERATION AND IT HELPS WITH SMOOTH REENTRY INTO WRITTEN UPON RELEASE. THEREBY REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES. AND LASTLY WE'RE REQUESTING ABILITY TO PROCURE INSTALL TWO MODULAR BUILDINGS TO ACCOMMODATE GROWING NUMBERS OF INCARCERATED PERSON ACTIVITY GROUPS. CURRENTLY VALLEY STATE PRISON HAS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY GROUPS AND WE WILL BE INCREASING THOSE BUT AS WE CONTINUE OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AND ALSO THESE OF MODULAR AS WELL ALLOW US AT THE INCLUDE CREASE PROGRAMS TO MINIMIZE WEIGHT LESS. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER SWANSON SAID WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR MODULAR FURNITUREIN HOUSING UNITS OF SELECTED PRISONS WHERE THE POPULATIONS HAVE MADE CONSCIOUS DECISIONS TO LEAVE PRISON GANGS AND PRISON POLITICS BEHIND. AND BUT THEY ARE LEAVING IS SELF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR SUCH AS DRUG USE VIOLENCE REFUSAL TO POSITIVELY PROGRAM TO BE INVOLVED IN PROCURING ILLEGAL CELLPHONES AND ALL THOSE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO WHO. HAVE NOT MADE THE STEP IN THEIR LIFE THE SELF REHABILITATE. SOME MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR RIPS AND GIPSON A COUPLE YEARS AGO VISITED AND MET WITH THE NORWEGIAN PRISON OFFICIALS WERE THOSE OFFICIALS EMPHASIZED TO MISS GIBSON AND- THE OTHER PEOPLE WENT THERE THE PRINCIPLE OF NORMALITY. PROGRESSION THROUGH A SENTENCE SHOULD BE AIMED AT RETURNING TO THE COMMUNITY. SO THE MODULAR FURNITURE WE'RE REQUESTING MAYOR IS THE NO WAY PRISON SYSTEM WHERE THEY'RE HOUSING UNITS REPRESENT COMFORT HEALING AND THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENTS.

THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES AN EXPANSION OF ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS BY CREATING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PATHWAY IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. BY LEVERAGING OUR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH RUSSIAN I COLLAGEN CSU FRESNO IN THE SOON TO BE AVAILABLE HELLO GRANT FUNDING. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'RE PLANNING TO SERVE UP TO EIGHTY STUDENTS PER YEAR UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION. I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS AND MORE DETAIL- ANSWER THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL POLL HALF. OUT OTHERWISE WE'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MR SWANSON. ARE THE NEXT ISSUE WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT- WAS ISSUE NINE WHICH HAS TO DO WITH STAFF MISCONDUCT AND THEIR DISCRIMINATE. DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT PROCESSES. IN AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE CITIES YOURS PROGRAMMING PROCESSES DEDICATED TO PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING STAFF MISCONDUCT AND DISCRIMINATION WHEN IT OCCURS. ADMISSION INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS THAT WILL ENABLE CDCR TO MAKE INSTITUTIONS SPECIFIC AND SYSTEM WIDE REFORMS AND IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE GOAL OF CONTINUING TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. HOUSING FUNDING OF THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE EIGHTY NINE POINT THREE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THIRTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION ON GOING TO SUPPORT. THIS INITIATIVE. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY MILLER AND I AM THE DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF CORRECTIONAL POLICY RESEARCH AN INTERNAL OVERSIGHT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND AS ERIC MENTIONED I AM HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS OUR REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO EXPAND CDC OURS OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OPERATIONS. THE FIRST ARE PART OF THIS WILL INVOLVE- RESPONSE TO AN ORDER BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT TO REFORM OUR STAFF COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINE PROCESSES. TO ENSURE CDC ARE COMPLETE UNBIASED COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO ALL ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT VIOLATING THE RIGHTS OF ANY CLASS MEMBER UNDER THE ARMSTRONG REMEDIAL PLAN OR THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. IN RESPONSE TO THE SARS REQUESTING FUNDING TO ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED SCREENING TEAM INSIDE THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SCREENING ALL INMATE GRIEVANCES AND OTHER CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO CDC ARE OUTSIDE THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS. WHICH DETERMINE IF THE CLAIM INVOLVES AN ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRALIZED SCREENING PROCESS WE ARE ALSO REQUESTING FUNDING TO EXPAND THE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS REQUIRED TO BE SENT TO THE ALLEGATION INCREMENTED CEMENT SECTION OF THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. TO INCLUDE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF SEPT STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF INMATE'S. ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PROTECTED CLASS MEMBERS. AND ALLEGATIONS OF RETALIATION BY. DUE TO THE USE OF THE STAFF COMPLAINT. THE FUNDING REQUEST WILL BE TO EMPLOY THE CHAIN NOTED ABOVE AT THE SIX INSTEAD. IDENTIFY IN THE COURT. IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIRE ESOS WITH THE COURT FOR WE ARE ALSO SEEKING FUNDING A STOP STATEWIDE IN. PROCESS FOR ALL USE OF FORCE AND PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST OUR- CURRENTLY INQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AND ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND STAFF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF INMATES ARE CONDUCTED BY SPECIALLY TRAINED INSTITUTION STAFF. UNLESS THERE IS ALREADY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATION OR IN THE CASE OF USE OF FORCE THERE ARE SERIOUS BODILY INJURY DOCUMENTED. WHEN ASSIGNED THESE IN CORY'S THE INSTITUTION STAFF ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE THEM IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THEIR REGULARLY ASSIGNED DUTIES. WHEN THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION WAS DEVELOPED USE OF FORCE AND STAFF SEXUALMISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM AMES BECAUSE THE EXISTING PROCESSES FOR REVIEWING THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR SEVERAL LAYERS OF REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT. BOTH INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY BY WAY OF THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. WITH THAT SAID CDCR DOES HOLY RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUSNESS AND THE SENSITIVITY THAT SURROUND THESE TYPES OF ALLEGATIONS AND HOW TROUBLING IT WOULD BE IF EVEN ONE OF THESE ALLEGATIONS IS NOT THOROUGHLY EXAMINED IN A FAIR AND ETHICAL MANNER. YOU SEE ARE ALSO KNOWS THE DEPARTMENT'S CREDIBILITY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN EVERY CASE. APPROPRIATE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO IDENTIFY CORRECT AND HOLD STAFF ACCOUNTABLE WHEN MISCONDUCT IS SUSTAINED. THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS DISTINCTLY SEPARATE FROM CDCR INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN OBJECTIVELY IN THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS. THIS INTENTIONAL SEPARATION MAKES INVESTIGATORS LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO BIAS AND INFLUENCE FROM WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE STAFF THEIR CHARGE TO INVESTIGATE. LIVING THE PROCESS FOR INVESTIGATING ALL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING USE OF FORCE STAFF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ANSPACH SEXUAL HARASSMENT AGAINST INMATES TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WILL ENHANCE THE INVESTIGATOR DASCHLE PROCESS BY ENSURING THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE INVESTIGATED BY STAFF. WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE INVESTIGATORY PROCESS AND WHOSE SOLE JOB IS TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. SHARE CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL AND I WILL AND STAY ON IN CASE THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISS MILLER. IT.

THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AND USED AS A BASIS WE ALSO- LOOKED TO THE D. S. H. HAS RECENTLY PROPOSED TO UPDATE IT STAFFING RATIOS ON AN EXTENSIVE WORKLOAD. ANALYSIS AND SO WE- INCLUDED THAT UPDATED RATIO FROM A ONE TO THIRTY FIVE FOR INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY PATIENTS TO ONE TO THIRTY AND ALONG WITH THAT- IN IN THE- NURSING AREA WE LOOK TO TITLE TWENTY TWO WHICH IS ESTABLISH STANDARD- MODEL OF CARE FOR. ACUTE SENSES BEDS AS WELL AS OUR MED CLASS MODEL THAT WAS APPROVED IN- ADDITIONALLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND A B. C. PMM UPDATED AGAIN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE CPA AND WE USE THOSE RATIOS AND APPLIED THEM- TWO DIFFERENT- PROGRAM AREAS- TO DEVELOP. A MODEL AND TWO INCH OTHER A STAFFING CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE- CURRENTLY- AND IN OUR OTHER SEC ARE HEALTHCARE AREAS- THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR CUSTODY POSITIONS- THERE WAS A REVIEW DONE- BY THE DIVISION OF ALL ADULT INSTITUTIONS- AND- THEY ARE LOOKED AT THE FUNCTIONS THAT NEED TO BE. REPLACED WE HAD EMPLOYEES IN THESE UNITS WHICH ARE MEDICAL TECH ASSISTANCE THEY HAVE PROVIDED SOME NURSING AND SOME CUSTODY FUNCTIONS- WE NEEDED TO REPLACE THOSE BECAUSE THE FUNCTIONS AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE ARE. THE MOST APPROPRIATE- CLASSIFICATION FOR THESE HIGH SECURITY AREAS SO- WE BUILT IN CUSTODY WE ALSO BUILT IN SOME PRIMARY CARE AND SOME ANCILLARY POSITIONS DUE TO THE- EXTENSIVE WORKLOAD THAT THAT DOES COME OUT OF THESE AREAS- IN THE IN THE PROPOSAL YOU'LL SEE- WE INCLUDED ALL THE CALCULATIONS- IN OUR WORKBOOKS- AND- WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A LATE PROPOSAL WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT.

AT TWENTY FOUR ADDITIONAL INSTITUTIONS THIS PROPOSAL ALONG WITH EXISTING EFFORTS UNDER WAY WILL FLUCTUATE A ROLLOUT OF NEW VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AT ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS STATEWIDE. THESE RESOURCES AND COMPLEMENTARY FUNDING INCLUDED IN THE ARMSTRONG COURT COMPLAINTS PROPOSAL ONE ABLE CDCR TO INSTALL FIX SECURITY CAMERAS AT NINE TO TEN INSTITUTIONS. PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WOMEN OF THIS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER SURVEY ACROSS THE PRISON SYSTEM AND GREATLY INCREASE CDC OUR CAPACITY TO OPERATE SAFE. AND EFFECTIVE PRISONS. SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO JENNIFER SHAFFER AND THEN I THINK OUR MARATHON OF ISSUES IS OVER. THANK THANK YOU CAN YOU AND SEE ME NOW YES WE CAN. EXPLAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I'M JENNIFER SCHAEFFER EXECUTIVE OFFICER ABOARD PRO HEARINGS. THE BORDER HEARINGS EXTRA A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER PROJECTED PRO HEARINGS MAINLY AS RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS. DUE TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. THE RESULT OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN IN RE GATLIN WHICH EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN AND THE EXPANSION OF ELDERLY PEOPLE UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO FOUR. THE BOARD PRINT IT WILL NEED TO SCHEDULE NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND PAROLE HEARING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THE BOARD SCHEDULED SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED CALL HEARINGS. TO ADDRESS THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD THIS PROPOSAL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS FROM SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW THE BOARD TO EXPAND ITS PRO HEARING CAPACITY TO MEET THE PROJECTED WORKLOAD. IT WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH AN ADDITIONAL SIX POSITIONS OF THE BOARD AND- LEVIN POINT THREE POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT TO HANDLE THE ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS CRITICAL TO SCHEDULING AND CONDUCTING PAROLE HEARINGS. THIS BROWN'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE CONDUCTING HEARINGS BY VIDEO CONFERENCE. SINCE APRIL FIRST OF LAST YEAR THE BOARD IS CONDUCTED ALL PAROLE HEARINGS BY VIDEO CONFERENCE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF AN EMERGENCY ORDER. CONDUCTING HEARINGS BY VIDEO CONFERENCE HAS NOT IMPACTED THE OUTCOME LET'S HEARINGS HELD. AND CONDUCTING HEARINGS BY VIDEO CONFERENCE ALLOWS THE BOARD TO CONDUCT MORE HEARINGS BY ELIMINATING. TRAVEL TIME FOR COMMISSIONERS AND DEPUTY COMMISSIONERS. THE BOARD IS ALSO PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE THE STATUTORY MANDATE TO PROVIDE NOTICE OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO THE JUDGE WHO CONDUCTED AT THE INCARCERATED PERSON SENTENCING HEARING. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE BOARD HAS SENT MORE THAN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND NOTICES THE SENTENCING JUDGES VIA THE US MAIL AS REQUIRED UNDER THE PENAL CODE. THE BOARD RECEIVED LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED RESPONSES TO THOSE NOTICES THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDED INPUT CONCERNING THE PAROLE HEARING. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THESE PROPOSALS I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS IN THE HOUSE. OKAY THANK YOU MACHE FOR. MISTER SWANSON ANY OTHER. I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH ISN'T IT I THINK WE SHOULD THE POINT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU- OKAY- YES WE GO TO THE L. A. L. PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAITLYN ON YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TOGETHER AND MY COLLEAGUE LUKE AND I HAVE COMMENTS ON EACH OF THE SEVENTEEN ITEMS WITHIN THIS ISSUE UNLESS YOU'D LIKE US TO PROCEED DIFFERENTLY OUR PLAN IS TO GO IN ORDER OF THE AGENDA WHICH PEOPLE PASSING IT BACK AND FORTH. BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND THEN OF COURSE PLEASE. YOUR FREE DUI INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. AND I WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE WHICH IS. A BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH JUDGE PROJECTIONS FOR THE INDIAN PROBABLY POPULATIONS. AND AS YOU RECALL AND THERE IT COUNTY JAILS CURRENTLY HAVE A BACKLOG OF AROUND SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO. HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON BUT HAVEN'T BEEN TRANSFERRED THERE YET DUE TO THE STOPPAGE OF INTAKE THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE OVER MUCH OF THE PAST YEAR DUE TO CODE NINETEEN. AND YOU MINISTRATION EXPECTS TO CONTINUE RAMPING UP INTAKE AT. THROUGHOUT THIS BUDGET YEAR AND CLEARING THAT BACKLOG DURING THE BUDGET YEAR- SO ACCORDINGLY THEY'RE PROJECTING ANY INCREASE IN THE INMATE POPULATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR HOWEVER IN THAT PROJECTION DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR TIME THAT THESE INMATES HAVE BEEN SERVING WHILE IN COUNTY JAIL AWAITING TRANSFER TO STATE PRISON- GIVEN THAT. NOTHING ABOUT THE RENDON TAKE SHOULD AFFECTED THE LENGTH OF IN ONE SENTENCE REALLY JUST A LOCATION WE THINK THAT NOT ACCOUNTING FOR THAT TIME THEY'VE SERVED ON THEIR PRISON SENTENCE LIKELY RESULT IN AN OVER ESTIMATE OF THE POPULATION AT CDC ARE WEALTHY HOUSING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. HOWEVER ESTIMATING THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE REST OF THE OVERESTIMATION WOULD BE DIFFICULT SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING BUT I DOCKING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REVERT TO THE GENERAL FUND ANY FUNDING IT RECEIVED ASSOCIATED WITH INMATES HE DID NOT END UP SERVING AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND OF COURSE IT ABOUT THEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THAT IT- THE DEPARTMENT CDC ARE CONSTANTLY MONITORING THEIR BUDGET AND COULD VERY WELL RIVER THAT POPULATE THAT AND POPULATION RELATED FUNDING AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR BUT THERE'S NOT NOTHING THAT WOULD- REQUIRING THEM TO DO THAT IN FACT THEY COULD ALLOCATED TOWARD OTHER PURPOSES SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INTENDED TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THIS- POTENTIALLY EXCESS AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS ULTIMATELY USED- AND THEN WITH THAT WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS I'M ITEMS TWO THROUGH FIVE BUT I WILL HAND IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES. TO DISCUSS ITEMS SIX. YOU MORROW LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I. THE TWENTY SIX IS ABOUT WAY MOM AND RELATED PROPOSALS. ON THE STARTING OFF TALKING ABOUT THAT. AND EXPANDED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS A PROPOSAL FOR VALLEY STATE PRISON. WE THINK THIS RESULT COULD HAPPEN ERIC BUT OVERALL OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IS UNCLEAR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE RESOURCES FOR EVALUATION TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE BUT BUT YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE- YOUR MAKE THE FUNDING LIMITED IT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND A CAR IN THE PARKING TRICK OR RESULTS OF THAT. NO LATER THAN A TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS WILL THE LEGISLATURE TO USE MODERATION DETERMINE WHETHER THE ONGOING RESOURCES SHOULD BE PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM BEING IN TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE VALUATION WERE TO SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS COST EFFECTIVE THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. TO THEN PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING. THE NEXT. ROSA WITH THIS ITEM WAS ABOUT MY- GRATEFUL EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF NEW FURNITURE- FOR VARIOUS YARDS. THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM. WE THINK IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS WOULD BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR CDCR TO IMPROVE REHABILITATION WITHIN THE PRISONS. THANK YOU FOR PROVING THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRES VCR TO RECORD WHETHER IT HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. RIGHT HOLD A MEET WITH ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. WHICH ONE POTENTIAL WAY THAT CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE REHABILITATION. WITHIN PERSONS. IF CAN THE THIS IS THE CASE OR- THE BILL COULD AMERICA. OTHERWISE THERE MAY BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO MEETING THE REHABILITATION NEEDS OF IN. I WILL NOT HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CAITLIN MCNEILL WHO WILL BE DISCUSSING NINE EIGHT WHICH IS THE NEXT. ITEM ON THE AGENDA FOR WHICH WE HAVE ISSUES- I THOUGHT CONCEPTS ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I THE L. A. I'M FINE ITEM AIDS IT WHITE INCRIMINATION OF EXPEDIA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS HE NEVER ONLY IN THAT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SEEMS NORMAL THE STAR CRUISERS GIVEN THAT IT COULD HELP PROVIDE- INJECTIVE EVIDENCE WITH WHICH TO EVALUATE CONCERNS ABOUT STAFF MISCONDUCT WHICH IS OF PARTICULAR. CONCERN RECENTLY AT VARIOUS PRISONS HOWEVER WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT IT WOULD FIND A WIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE ULTIMATELY AT ALL PRISONS OVER THREE YEARS- BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT INSTALLING VIDEO OUT OF PRISON THAT IS SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED AND THIS IS. BECAUSE WE ESTIMATE THAT- THE POPULATE WHAT WE BELIEVE THE. POPULATION PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT. OVER THE NEXT YEARS THE STATE COULD BE IN A THE CAUSES TO CLOSE. AROUND THREE THREE PRISONS IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED FOR CLOSER. SO WE RECOMMEND ONLY APPROVING FUNDING AT THIS TIME WHEN THE FOR PRISONS BACK ARE SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE. UNDER PROPOSAL DURING THE BUDGET YEAR BECAUSE THOSE FOR PRISONS ARE NOT PRESENT THAT. HERE TO BE STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE AND THERE'S NO NEED TO FIND AT THIS TIME INSTALLATION WORK FUTURE YEARS. SO IN A YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME BACK IN THE FUTURE TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR- TO ROLLOUT VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT OTHER PRISONS. YEARS AT WHICH POINT AT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE GREATER CLARITY ON WHICH PRISONS. RIGHT BECAUSE EACH YEAR. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT. YES OUR RECOMMENDATION WON'T AFFECT- THE INSTALLATION OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AT. PRISONS BETTER I'VE TO LOCATE OR ORDER RELATED TO. MISCONDUCT BECAUSE YOUR SURVEILLANCE FOR THOSE- REASONS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SEPARATE. AND THEN MOVING ARMS. RELATED TO THAT ISSUE IN FACT THAT PROPOSAL- SEARED SET OF PROPOSALS ITEM NINE STAFF MISCONDUCT AND FOR ME BETWEEN CLASSES- I HAVE COMMENTS ON THE STAFF MISCONDUCT- PROC PROCESS SEASON PACKAGES PROPOSALS RELATED TO THAT TOPIC. AND I HAVE TWO COMMENTS. ON ELEMENTS OF THAT PACKAGE. THE FIRST IS ON THE FOR HIM IN NEED PROBABLY ALLOCATE OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IN THIS TASK THANK YOU TO FIND- PROPOSAL TO FIND BODY WORN CAMERAS ON OFFICERS AT. REPORTER THE FIRST ON THE BACK END PROCESS FOR INVESTING YOU PROBABLY ALREADY. OF MISCONDUCT. FIND THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES. WORKING AND PROCESS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. BOTH THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT THAT THOSE- STAFF WILL BE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE PER YEAR AND THE TIME IT TAKES EACH STAFF PERSON TO COMPLETE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS IS VERY UNCERTAIN AND THIS IS BECAUSE I DETAILS OF THE PROCESS ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION AN ONGOING LAWSUIT. THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT- ARE SOON WILL REQUIRE INVESTIGATION AT PER YEAR IN THESE CLOTHES ALSO COMES FROM HISTORICAL DATA AT A TIME WHEN. POPULATION WAS MUCH HIGHER AND- THAN IT IS TODAY AND IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE FUTURE EASIER IT'S ALSO HAD SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY ESTIMATING THE TIME KERN MASTICATION IN FACT. IT REPORTS THAT IT. THE MEDICALLY UNDER. THAT TIME IN THAT EARLIER. ARE RELATED TO THIS APPROACH. YOUR IS ALSO LOOKING FOR EFFICIENT TO REDUCE THAT AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR BUT THOSE WHAT EFFICIENCY YOU WILL ULTIMATELY FIND AND WHAT ACT WILL HAVE- FOR EXAMPLE INSTALLATION VIDEO SURVEILLANCE. ASSEMBLY WELL USED AFTER TIME- PROTESTING. BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW BY HOW MUCH ALSO CONNECTING YOU. SEE YOUR- YES YOUR CONFERENCE IS SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING FAST TIME BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE- SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE REQUESTED NINETEEN MILLION AUGMENTATION FOR THIS PROCESS AND A NINE POINT NINE BASED FUNDING THAT ARE HAS FOR THE BEST YOU CAN TWENTY. YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS TO DISMISS. FOR PARTY MINISTRY. I REQUEST RESOURCES- AFTER HOW DATA WITH WHICH MORE ACCURATE ASSESSES HE- AND AGAIN THIS WAIT WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION COULD CERTAINLY COME FORWARD IN THE FUTURE WITH ME THE EXTENDED ENDS UP BEING OVER THIS. HAVING ACCESS RESOURCES- DO THOSE. BECAUSE COME FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE FUNDING BUT- DOESN'T HAVE AN- SOUTH AND SO WE RECOMMEND AND- REQUIRING THEM TO COME FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL NONETHELESS- INCREASED. OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROCESS AND THE RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR IT. I'M MOVING ON TO THE SECOND ELEMENT MACINNES I HAVE COMMENTS ON. HERE IS RECOMMENDED THEM AT BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE WORK ORDER AT SIX BUSINESS. THE GIVEN YOUR LONG WEEKS LIMITED IMPLEMENTING BODY WORK NUMBERS AND LIMITED. AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS MORE BROADLY RECOMMENDED. THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE AN EVALUATION. AFTER FINDING RIDICULOUS FIND- THEN WE DID NOT RAISE CAN ON ITEM AND I WILL. WE'LL DISCUSS ITEM. FROM HERE ON MORGAN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON I AM IN ELEVEN WHAT DOES MENTAL HEALTH CARE ARGUMENTS ARE ON THE U. N. SIXTY FOUR POSITIONS AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION ON GOING FOR A SECOND YEAH TRICK INPATIENT PROGRAMS WELL THE MINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AS OF YESTERDAY EVENING WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW ALONG WITH ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO PROVIDE WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION DEMONSTRATING A NUMBER OF REQUESTS OF PETITIONS OR THE INCREASING SERVICE LEVELS ARE NECESSARY. FOR EXAMPLE CDCR HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CURRENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY EXISTING STAFF OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS PARTY ADEQUATE IN ADDITION WHAT CITIES ARE INDICATED THAT HAS OR ALREADY HAS SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET THE PROJECTED. NEEDS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES. TO PROVIDE. TREATMENT CAPACITY AT THAT MOST IN LOW OF CARE- IN ADDITION TO EXISTING SERVICES. I SAID WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT APPROVE THE PROPOSAL UNLESS IT IS YOUR COMBINED SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSED STAFFING AND SERVICE LEVELS INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST. AND THE NEXT TIME FOR TRIPP COMMONS IS ITEM THIRTEEN WHICH I WILL HAND OVER TO ILLINOIS DEAL THANK YOU. I AM THIRTEEN IS A FIFTY MILLION AUGMENTATION TO THE ONE TIME AT FIFTY MILLION AUGMENTATION BECAUSE IN JANUARY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WOULD BRING THE- TOTAL PROPOSED ONE HANG UP TIME AUGMENTATION. AT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU HUNDRED MILLION ON TOP OF THE DEPARTMENTS TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BASED BUDGET. FOR THAT PURPOSE- AS I NOTED IN MY COMMENTS EARLIER IN THE STATE COULD BE IN A POSITION TO CLOSE THREE PRISONS- IN ADDITION TO THE TWO ALREADY ANNOUNCED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WE THINK THAT- THE CALIFORNIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY IN SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON AND CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY IN SOLEDAD. APPEAR TO BE STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE HI ESTIMATED REPAIR COSTS RELATIVE TO THEIR INMATE CAPACITY. AND I WOULD NOT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED. A LIST OF PRISONS THAT IT BELIEVED TO BE STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE TO THE EXTENT THE STATE THE POPULATION DECLINE ENABLES THE STATE TO. CLOSE ADDITIONAL PRISONS- WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR THIRD THAT THE TOTAL HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR IMITATION- GIVEN THAT SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. BUT WE RECOMMEND APPROVING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT- WOULD PROHIBIT CITIES HERE FROM SPENDING THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME LIMITATION AND IT'S TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR BASED BUDGET. ON PRISONS THAT ARE STRONG CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE AND LESS THE DEPARTMENT PUTS FORWARD. AND SHOWING THAT THOSE FACILITIES WILL NOT BE CLOSED AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS REALLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE DEPARTMENT'S TOTAL NEED INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED WHICH IT ESTIMATES AT AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS AND POTENTIALLY AS HIGH AS THIRTEEN BILLION JUST IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALONE- SO THERE'S ALREADY GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME VERY TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO SPEND THIS- THIS HUNDRED MILLION- SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WON'T. RESULT IN LESS. WHAT HERE IS NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR BEING MET WE'RE JUST SAYING LONG ISN'T A VAST MAJORITY OF THE NEED IS NOT GOING TO BE MATH LET'S TRY LET'S. NOT ALLOCATED FOR PRISONS THAT HAVE A HIGHER CHANCE OF CLOSURE YEAH- AND WE DO NOT RAISE CONCERNS AN ISSUE THE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN AND I WILL PASS IT OFF TO LOOK COOL DIFFERENT COMMENTS ON ITEM SIXTEEN SEVENTY. BRITISH MORE OVER THE L. A. L. I AM SIXTEEN ALSO DEALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH SIMILAR TO A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL- UNDER THIS ONE- ACR AND JUST THE NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE MENTAL. HEALTH DECISIONS BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE INMATE POPULATION ANNUALLY. AND PASS YOUR SEATS ARE UNABLE TO FILL OF CIVIL SERVICE MEDAL HEALTH ISSUES AND IF YOU DON'T IF THE SURPLUS FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE THINKING POSITIONS FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTY GOING LIKE HI TRANSPOSITIONS. EIGHT USED FOR ABORTION THE FUNDING TO OR CONTRACTED PSYCHIATRY REGISTRY SERVICES WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO MAINTAIN. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES OR IN ANY- DESPITE HAVING A SHORTAGE OF STAFF WRITTEN. IN THEIR EVER FUND THIS BY USING SOME OF THIS. FUNDING ASSOCIATED. WITH THOSE BIG POSITIONS. DUE TO A LARGE CROWD IT MAY OF THE BAY. SUPPORTS ARE IN THE WHOLE POSITIONS ARE BEING. AND MULTI PLANTS ELIMINATE THE POSITION IF YOU'RE DO WE A LOT PORTION OF THE ON THE FOR THESE MISSION. DIRECTLY NINE THREE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FORTY POINT THREE MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY YOU AN ONGOING IN FUNDING THAT OTHERWISE- WOULD HAVE BEEN MOVED WITH APARTMENTS BUDGET. THE MINISTRY SHOULD BE THAT A WILL OF THE FUN FOR BE USED FOR PSYCHIATRIC REGISTRY SERVICES WHETHER YOU MAY NOT BE USED TOBACCO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH ELIMINATED POSITIONS. ADMINISTRATION INDICATES HAS BEEN REDIRECTED FROM THESE POSITIONS TO OTHER PURPOSES WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM- THANK A TIME BUT JUST RECENTLY THIS WEEK BENEFIT HAD INDICATED THAT- A PORTION OF THIS FUNDING NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION. HI BEN- WE DIRECTED TO AN INCREASE IN POSITIONS THAT WERE AUTHORIZED IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN BUDGET TACTICAL BROOKS FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED HOWEVER THE NATIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT THESE OTHER OR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE FUNDING WAS REDIRECTED HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED. ASSETS WERE RECOMMENDED APPROVING ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY YOU BECOME OF THE FUNDING SHORTFALL FOR THE COUNTRY REGISTRY SERVICES I DO NOT APPROVE THE REMAINING FUNDING UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE REDIRECTED FUNDS IS BEING USED FOR PURPOSES. CONSISTENT. WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. THAT INCLUDES ITEMS SIX MEETING FOR I KNOW SEVEN. THE MOTIVE IT ANNUAL POINTS- FOR MAINTENANCE I. THAT MIGHT CLOSE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROPOSALS. TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING IS NOT SPENT UNNECESSARILY ON INFRASTRUCTURE PRISONS. ARE CLOSED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE FIRST OF THE CATHOLIC WORLD RULES THAT WE- RECOMMENDED MODIFICATION TO GO TO A PRESS THIS IS FOR THE HEALTHCARE FACILITY PROJECTS SICK. WELL WE DO NOT CONSUME THE CHANGE THE STRUCTURE BENEFIT PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED YOU KNOW TO THE PROPOSAL. WE INCREASE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AXIOM FEED THAT WHICH HADN'T BEEN BY PLANS A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR CLOSURE. WE THE LEGISLATURE MODIFIED PROPOSED BUDGET BUILDING BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION RESTRICTING MINISTRATION FOR MAKING ANY EXPENDITURE OR THAT THE PROPOSED FUNDING PRISONS AT THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFIES AS FROM CANDIDATES FOR CLOSURE. THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS. THAT AND ONCE THE DEPARTMENT PUTS FOR CHRISTY CLOSURE PLAN WHEN THE NEEDS BASILIDES. WILL NOT BE CLOSE. THE NEXT. WITHIN THE MEDICATION ROOMS WHICH TRAVIS- RECOMMENDATION WE KNOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD RESULT IN PROVIDED FUNDING TO A PROJECT AT THE CALIFORNIA TRAINING FACILITY CT. WHEN THE PERSONS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR CLOSURE. I SAID WE RECOMMENDED. YEAH YEAH JUST FOR ME PLEASE. OKAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE FRIENDS AWARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WILL COMMENT ON- A FEW OF THE PROPOSAL HERE FOR CDC ARE IN RESPONSE TO THE L. A. O. THAT INCLUDES THE NORTH PROPOSALS WHICH I BELIEVE RIGHT AND SIX OF YOUR AGENDA SO THAT'S THE BALLOT STATE PRISON HANCE MINTS. AND IF THE FURNITURE REPLACEMENT-ITEM NUMBER EIGHT ON YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS THE STATE WIDE X. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND THEN ITEM UMBER NINE ON YOUR AGENDA WHICH IS THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. SO TO START OFF WITH VALLEY STATE PRISON FIRST THE MINISTRY MISSION DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE REPORT DATE IS ENOUGH TIME TO COLLECT MEANINGFUL DATA. ON THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO RECIDIVISM AND POST RELEASE OUTCOMES. EVEN THOSE YOUR AS PROPOSING TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM OUT A COMMONS THE MAJORITY OF THE PUZZLES MEASURES REPRESENT BEST PRACTICES RECOGNIZED IN THE CORRECTIONAL SETTING. AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE NORWAY MODEL IN OTHER CONTEXTS SO MUCH IS INCREASE ACCESS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REBUILDING REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES. AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING ADDITIONAL DATA WILL BE HELPFUL IN. GAUGING PROBLEM AFFECTED IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF POTENTIALLY UNDERTAKING TARGETED EXPANSIONS OF DIFFERENT PROGRAM ELEMENTS THROUGHOUT SEIZE YOUR SYSTEM BUT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT THE ECONOMICS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE NOT THEMSELVES EVIDENCE BASED FOR EFFECTIVE. THE PROPOSAL CORE COMPONENTS HAVE ONE TIME FUNDING NECESSARY TO STAND THEM UP AND THESE PROGRAMS DO NOT LEND THEMSELVES WELL TO LIMITED TERM FUNDING. ADMINISTRATION IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CITY SEARCH CURRENT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM OFFERINGS. BUT SUGGESTING THAT DATE- DATA SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN A LITTLE PROPOSAL IS NOT A REASONABLE APPROACH. AND MOVING ON TO THE FURNITURE PROPOSAL IN THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT INTEND TO REPLACE OTHER REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS BUT SERVES AS A COMPLEMENT TO THOSE EFFORTS BY CREATING A MORE WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT. IN WHICH INMATES CAN PURSUE REBUILD IT REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES AGAIN EXCUSE ME- CURRENTLY THESE FACILITIES HAVE- STERILE METAL FURNITURE DATING IS TYPICAL TO AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING BUT VERY MUCH CONTRARY SURE OF REHABILITATIVE SETTING- THIS IS A ONE TIME COST TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING EFFORTS. IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TAKING A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING- AND FINALLY ON THIS ONE I WOULD NO DATE ONE OF THE SUCCESSES OF THE NORWAY MODEL IS. AND ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING OCCURS AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL INTENDS TO ACHIEVE IS ENHANCING PROGRAMMING. I CREATED A MORE CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS REHABILITATION IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AS THE ELLIE- RECOMMENDATIONS SUGGESTS. AND THEN WE TO YOU I NUMBER EIGHT- WHICH IS STATEWIDE SURVEILLANCE. THESE FUNDS TO INSTALL VIDEO CAMERAS- PROPOSED OVER THREE FISCAL YEARS TWO PROVIDED FEASIBLE ROLLOUT SCHEDULE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN THIS GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROJECTS AND VARIANCE FROM INSTITUTIONS TO TEACH AND AS WELL AS FLEXIBILITY FOR SEA SHEPHERD ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES AS THEY OCCUR OVER TIME. SO THE FLEXIBILITY THE L. A. DESCRIBES IS BAKED INTO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL THIS INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE CERTAINTY AROUND THE INTENT TO YOU OF ACTUATE THIS STATEWIDE ROLLOUT WITHIN THE STATE'S CURRENT FISCAL OUTLOOK- WE'RE ONE TIME RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND THIS CERTAINLY IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT AND PROJECT PLANNING. AND THE LAST ONE I WOULD NOTE HERE IS THAT AT AS MY COLLEAGUE- CRISTINA BRIDGE NOTED EARLIER- REGARDING THAT THE POPULATION. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND CURRENT AND FUTURE POPULATION PROJECTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THESE RESOURCES INCLUDED HERE- BECAUSE HOLDING OUT DEPLOYMENTS- AND LYFT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND POPULATION PROJECTIONS. WOULD ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND DELAYED REALIZATION OF THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIXED CAMERAS ACROSS CDCR SYSTEM INCLUDED INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. AND THEN FINALLY MOVING ON TO THE- STAFF COMPLAINT PACKAGE AGAIN UP WITH THIS ITEM NUMBER NINE I WILL START OFF WITH- THE USE OF FORCE AND CREE OF PARTS. OF THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES APPROVAL OF A LIMITED TERM RESOURCES CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM RECRUITING FOR LIMITED TERM POSITION CAN BE CHALLENGING AND DOCUMENTS VCRS ABILITY TO HIRE TRAIN AND RETAIN THESE POSITIONS. ADMINISTRATION UNDERSCORES THAT EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIAL BOTH TO MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARMSTRONG COURT WERE AND TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN CONVERSATIONS EARLIER THIS YEAR. APPROVAL OF ONGOING RESOURCES DOES NOT LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT PROGRAM STAFFING LEVELS OR AFFECT MR THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS CCR HAS ALREADY MADE DECISIVE COMMITMENTS TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OF ITS PROGRESS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND THAT'S REGARDLESS OF THE TIME SPAN THE REQUESTED RESOURCES. AND THEN MOVING ON TO YOU- FINALLY THE ARMSTRONG PEAS- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE ON BODY WORN CAMERAS THE CITIES ARE IS MONITORING THE USE OF BODY WORN CAMERAS AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF. COLLECTING DATA REGARDING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AND THEY ARE BEING PURSUED ON A PILOT BASIS- PURSUANT TO THE ARMSTRONG COURT ORDER. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND IS OPEN TO DISCUSSING HOW BEST TO DO THAT. AND WITHIN THAT TIME TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MICHAEL FLEISCHMAN- FOR COMMENTS ON MORE OF THE PROPOSAL'S. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL SESSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE FIRST- ISSUE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE AREA ON SUNDAYS NUMBER ELEVEN MENTAL HEALTH CARE SPECIFICALLY THE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT. OF PROGRAM INTEGRATION AND STANDARDIZATION PROPOSAL. UP WITH REGARDS TO A JUSTIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES DETAILED BACKUPS OF THE CALCULATIONS AND METHODOLOGIES THAT NGUYEN IN DETERMINING THE POSITION. KURDISTAN'S BRINGING WITH HER HIPS A PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT- PROGRAM INTO CONFORMING WITH THE SAME STAFFING LEVELS THAT pJUST PROCESS. AS WELL AS MEETING STATE AND FEDERAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION AS DALY NOTED IT IS WORKING WITH THE L. A. L. ACT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE SEC. AND THEN JUST ON THE ON THE CONCERNED ABOUT REQUESTING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. THAT EACH OF FOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING THAT VERY VERY NARROW ASPECT THE PROPOSAL NOT OF THE FLAG STANDS. WHICH ARE BANDS THAT CAN SHIFT BETWEEN LEVELS OF CARE- LOWER HIGHER ASK NEEDED IN IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION. BUT THEN MOVING ON TO THE LARGER PROPOSAL- JUSTIFICATION WHEN THESE THREE TIPS WE'RE ONE THREE CATCHER TRANSFERRED. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO CDC ARE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS TRANSFER WAS SIMPLY SHIFTING. DASH RESOURCES TO CDCR DISHES OPERATIONS AT THE TIME BUT FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. IN MANY WAYS FROM THOSE OF CDCR FOR EXAMPLE GASH. HAD A DECENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE THAT IS NOT RIGHT SIX YEARS MORE CENTRALIZED PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURE. IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE FULLY INTEGRATE THE THREE LIFT AND SHIFT. IN THE CDCR CELEBRATIONS AND THEN BRING STAFFING INTO A LINE ACROSS THE THREE TIPS THAT WERE DIFFERENT H. AND D. TO- THAT SHE CAN SEE ARE STARTED ON ITS OWN. USING CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES THAT REFLECTS USE YOUR STERN OPERATIONAL NEEDS IN A WAY THAT WILL BEST SERVE. THE PATIENTS OF THESE JUST SURVEYS. THE MINUTE IS NOW BROUGHT FOR THESE CHAIN UNTIL THIS TIME ORDER TO BE L. A. TO. MORE THE MOST THOUGHTFUL OF HER ABOUT HOW TO. THE TIPS MODELS. THE NEXT THING THAT I WANT SPEAK TO OUR IS AND- ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN- THE REDIRECTION OF FUNDING FROM. LISTED IN THE AGENDA AS REDIRECTION OF FUNDING FROM A LIMITED CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS. TO SHANGHAI AND PSYCHIATRY REGISTRY STUFF. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE BEARS IT'S NOT JUST FOR REGISTRY TO US AND THAT THERE IS A SHORTFALL. OF WHICH HAS HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS AND WE ARE STILL WORKING. ARE STILL WORKING IN ORDER TO. DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW THE SHORTFALL HAD COME UP I DON'T WANT TO CHEW UP THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONLY REDIRECTING FUNDING FROM ONE PURPOSE YOU ANOTHER EXTRACTED THE- NINE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS STEP ASIDE EIGHT. I WAS NOT IN FACT A REDIRECTION- BUT IT WAS JUST NOT FUNDING- IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT OUR COMMITMENT IS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM AT THE LEVEL THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT IT DEBTS- SO WE'RE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT A LONG TERM SOLUTION- OUR BIGGEST INTEREST IS GETTING THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE BUDGET YEAR- BUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BE OUR NEED EXPRESSED HERE- AND ARE EXCITED- I GUESS BUT- INTERESTED HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL JUSTIFICATION. AND MAYBE MEET. LAST NAME IN THE PARKING OF FINANCE BUT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN- JUST CIRCLING BACK TO ISSUES THIRTEEN AND SEVENTEEN WHICH REGARD BE INFRASTRUCTURE- EXPENDITURES ON CD STARK STATE PRISONS. I THE MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE ANXIETY OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FOR INFRASTRUCTURE GIVEN THE CONCERN OF FUTURE PRISON CLOSURES POSSIBILITIES- HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO RIGHT SIZING THAT. THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM BUT IDENTIFICATION OF WHICH PRISON TO CLOSE RANGE A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT REQUIRES TAKING MORE INTO ACCOUNT BEEN JUST INFRASTRUCTURE CONDITIONS AND NEEDS- OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS INCLUDE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMMING EMISSIONS FOR POPULATIONS THAT THOSE PRISONS. ARE THE STAFFING LEVELS AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AVAILABLE FOR THE INMATES. WERE ALSO CONSIDERED WITH OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT ARISE WHEN YOU CAN JUST IDENTIFYING PRISON FOR POTENTIAL CLOSER ONCE AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE- EVEN IF ONLY FOR A RANKING OF INSTITUTIONS THAT THREATENS CDC OURS ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN STAFF AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS. DESPITE BENITEZ FOR THEM TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL UNTIL CLOSURE THIS CAN BE PARTICULARLY DETRIMENTAL OF PHYSICIANS ARE NOT FILLED AND THE AREAS AND SOME PROGRAMS LIKE HEALTH CARE UNFILLED. UNFILLED POSITIONS MAINLY TO LEGAL ACTIVITY AGAINST THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR EXAMPLE THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY UNDER A TWO THOUSAND AND TWO QUARTER ORDER TO ACHIEVING 90% FILL RATE FOR PSYCHIATRIST POSITIONS. AND CDCR ALREADY HAS TROUBLE FILLING THOSE POSITIONS AND PREMATURELY IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE EXACERBATE THOSE DIFFICULTIES- AGAIN CLOSING OR EVEN JUST IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE IS A MAJOR DECISION HAS NORMA'S IMPLICATIONS. BUT THE STAFF WHO WORK THERE INMATES HOUSED IN LIVING THERE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. I'M AS SUCH IDENTIFYING PRISONS CLOSURE IS A PATH WE DO NOT WANT TO START DOWN THE WE'RE RELATIVELY CERTAIN THAT IT CAN BE COMPLETED- AS SUCH. WE THINK THE NOTION HAVE PROHIBITING ARE HOLDING HOSTAGE INSTEAD. FROM RECEIVING NEEDED. REPAIR UNTIL CDC PROVIDE STATUS OF PRISON. IS- SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE IN. IMPACT APARTMENTS ABILITY TO ME ITS ME AND- FOR THE POPULATIONS INVOLVED- AMBASSADOR WRAP UP- FOR OUR COMMENTS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE. I'M JUST TO KIND OF CIRCLE BACK WITH THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS I'M WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IS NECESSARY AS MISTER NEAL MENTION. ON THIS IS THAT A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THAT WEEK COMPLETE TWICE A YEAR AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN AGAIN AT THE ME RADIATION HOME RECEPTION POPULATION. IN TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE POPULATION REGARDING. THEIR- TERM THEY'VE ALREADY SERVED IN STATE JAILS THAT'S LIKELY TO BE AN OUT YEAR IMPACT SO WHAT NECESSARILY IMPACT THAT THE REQUEST FOR HER FOR THE BUDGET YEAR FUNDING IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD- ADJUSTING REFLECTED THAT THE FOLLOWING GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU AND HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS BY HALF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I OKAY VETTEL ALL DEPARTMENTS OKAY- NOW WE GET COULD JUMP IN- MAYBE WE COULD DO THIS UP SIR NEWMAN ALDS START AND IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING BEFORE THAT OR AFTER THAT WE CAN THAT'S RIGHT I DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE- OF FIGHTING. OKAY ALL RIGHT ON ON ON ITEM THREE THE COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE- CAN CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE CHANGES IN THE RESEARCH REQUESTED RESOURCES GIVEN THE REDUCTION IN CASES AT CDC ARE- THE IN PERSON VISITATION AND ALSO THE VACCINE OF ROLLOUT- MAYBE YOU COULD UPDATE US ON THE VACCINATION NUMBERS FOR STAFF AND THE INCARCERATED- YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE THOSE. STEPS BUT CONSIDERING ALL OF THIS- WHAT CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE REQUESTED RESOURCES. YEAH THIS IS ERIC'S ONCE AGAIN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE GODWIN READER TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT VACCINATIONS THAT ARE PART OF THAT YOU KNOW IT IS DIFFICULT WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS DIFFICULT BUDGETING FOR KOBE- HOW WE WENT ABOUT- ESTIMATING A RESOURCES FOR BUDGET YEAR. IS LOOKING AT- OUR ACTUAL SPENDING THROUGH MARCH AND THEN TRIED TO ADJUST IT DOWN BASED ON- FACTORS WE KNOW ABOUT SO WE ARE THERE IS A ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THINGS THAT WE KNOW MAKE CONTINUING BUDGET YEAR SUCH AS CLEANING AND THE WE HAVE BEEN USING A RENTING TENTS IN SOME CASES AND THAT MAY CONTINUE. IN BUDGET YEAR AS WELL IN ADDITION- BY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE PURCHASING- PP EQUIPMENT AND ALL THAT. SO THOSE ARE THE COULD TIE AND WE MAY HAVE TO- CONTINUE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TESTING AS WELL WHICH ALL TURNED OVER TO DUANE RIEDER WHO COULD TALK ABOUT TESTING AND ALSO. WHERE WE ARE AS FAR AS VACCINES. GOOD AFTERNOON MANAGER DOING READER- DEBBIE DIRECTOR CCHS- CURRENTLY. WE HAVE ABOUT 45% OF OUR- STAFF VACCINATED IN ABOUT. 68% OFOUR INMATE POPULATION VACCINATED- WE ARE CONTINUING TO ENCOURAGE STAFF- VIA EDUCATION TO GET VACCINATED WE ARE OFFERING- APPOINTMENT FREE- VACCINATIONS OF MATERNA. AND THE JOHNSON JOHNSON ONE SHOT. AND WE- DEVELOPED A LEARNING- MODULE THAT STAFF CAN TAKE TO HELP EDUCATE THEM ON THE ON THE PARAMETERS OF THE VACCINATIONS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO GET VACCINATED- THROUGH EDUCATION MODULE- IS FOR STAFF TESTING- WITH THE VACCINATION NUMBERS. WHERE THEY'RE AT AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO STUFF TESTING- THINGS ARE CHANGING- THROUGH CDC AND ANSWER THE STATE GUIDELINES AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- TO. REVISE OUR GUIDELINES AS NECESSARY- BUT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE A VERY. TIGHT POPULATION VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY. AND SO- AT THIS POINT- WE'RE STILL- TESTING- BOTH STAFF AND INMATES- TO INSURE IT BUT WE. DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL OUTBREAKS. DO YOU HAVE A- A GOAL THAT YOU SET TO REACH I MEAN I KNOW WE ALL WANT WELL MOST OF US ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT IS THERE A GOAL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. NO OUR GHOST OF ACTUALLY IS MANY STAFF AND PATIENTS AS POSSIBLE- AND WE'RE WE'RE ENCOURAGING THAT THROUGH EDUCATION WEREN'T PURGING THAT THROUGH. OFFERING CLINICS- AND DO IT EVERY CHIU EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET STAFF ACTION AT IT BUT- OUR GOAL IS TO VACCINATE AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. OKAY ARE WITH IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STAFF. OF LEVEL OF VACCINATION AND THE INMATE- EIGHT YOU SAID YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR- VOLUNTARY- USING PERSUASION OR- I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER- TACTICS- BUT- WHAT HAPPENS IF IT STAYS AT THAT LEVEL. YOU KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH THE CDC GUIDELINES AND FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES- WE ARE JUST HOPING TO EDUCATE WE EVER LEADERSHIP GOING OUT THERE AND- WORKING WITH THEIR STAFF AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND ENCOURAGING. THEM TO GET VACCINATED AND TRYING TO DISPEL ANY RUMORS- ARE ANY CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE- BUT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET GET FOLKS FASCINATED- AND IF IT. IF THEY ARE- OR IF THEY SAY THEY'RE VACCINATED DO YOU REQUIRE THEM TO SHOW PROOF A VACCINATION- AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING- STAFF TO SHOW PROOF OF VACCINATION- IF THEY SAY THEY ARE. NOT NOT AS A REQUIREMENT FOR WORK. IF THEY SAY THAT THEY ARE VACCINATED DO YOU REQUIRE PROOF OF THAT- WE ALL HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU OKAY I AS FAR AS I KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN- ASKING TH- STAFF TO PROVE THEIR VACCINATIONS AT THIS POINT BUT LET ME LET ME- DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT FOR YOU OKAY. GREAT- CENTER YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM NOT IN STOCK. OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S. JUMP AHEAD TO- MY FAVORITE THE NORWAY NUMBER SIX THE NORWAY MODEL. I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I HAD THE- I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF GOING TO NORWAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO I CAN REALLY PICTURE- AND IT WAS ALL VERY- PRETTY INCREDIBLE. TO SEE SUCH A DIFFERENT ICARCERATION PRISON SYSTEM- I KNOW OUR CONDITIONS ARE DIFFERENT AND HISTORIES AND ALL OF THAT BUT- PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE. ESTABLISHED SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE AND WE CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH AS- YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT REPLACING THE- I ROOM FURNITURE IS GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE OR NOT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS I KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO- CREATE A MORE THERAPEUTIC. ENVIRONMENT IN IRAQ I GIVE YOU ALL JUST A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THINKING ABOUT ALL THESE PIECES AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IN WHAT I SAW. OVER THERE. THE WEATHER'S MAXIMUM OF SECURITY OR YOU KNOW ON THEIR WAY OUT OF NO DOUBT THE ENVIRONMENT- WAS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INCLUDING FURNITURE AND OTHERS. BUT THE ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT EVEN MORE THAN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. WAS AND THEY MADE A POINT OF- WE WENT TO THE- THEIR EDUCATION FACILITY THEIR TRAINING FACILITY AND UP THAT STOOD OUT MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THERE PROGRAM. VERY LONG TRIP- TRAINING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BEFORE THEY'RE HIRED- AND THEIR CONSTANT OF FOCUS ON TRAINING OF THE OFFICERS. AND THEY WE EVEN HAD IN OUR GROUP A FEW OFFICERS FROM ANOTHER- STATE. AND THOSE PRISON OFFICIALS WENT AND THEY SHARED A OF VIDEO OF HOW THEY HAD APPLIED OF CERTAIN CONCEPTS ON DE ESCALATING SITUATIONS AND THEY SHOWED HOW THEY HAD APPLIED IT HERE IN THE US IN THEIR STATE. AND IT WAS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AS WELL SO WHAT STOOD OUT MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS THE CHANGE YOU KNOW THE CULTURE THE CHANGING TALKING THROUGH SAFETY FOR THE OFFICERS WITH AS MUCH OF A CONCERN IF NOT MORE OF A CONCERN. THEN THE INMATES OF AND SO IN ALL OF THIS CONVERSATION AROUND THE NORWAY MODEL- HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT THE TRAINING ALL OR- CHANGING OF THE CULTURE OF WILL BE. I CAN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S MISTER SWANSON- SOME OTHERS YEAH WHEN WE STARTED OFF- MADAM CHAIR- ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT'S NOT IN THE MAY REVISION BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE JANUARY BUDGET WAS TRYING TO LOOK AT- GETTING TO. CHANGING OUR- TRAINING SO IT BETTER REFLECTS. THIS GOAL OF AREA. YOU KNOW BETTER SORT OF NORWAY MODEL SORT OF. CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION MISSION- SO ONE THING WE WILL LOOK AT IT WAS- THERE'S- RESOURCES FOR DE ESCALATION AND THAT KIND OF TRAINING I DON'T HAVE THOSE FOLKS WITH ME TODAY BUT- LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MERION SPEARMAN WHO COULD KIND OF TALK ABOUT- HOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT VALLEY STATE PRISON. HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRPERSON MISTRESS BERMAN- SOCIAL DIRECTOR IN TOURING THE PRISON- SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF IN GETTING OUT TALKING TO STAFF DOWN THERE I IS SO UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT THERE WERE STAFF TRULY CARE ABOUT PRISONERS AND I AND I KNOW THIS COMES FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF WHARTON FISHER AND HIS MANAGEMENT TEAM. AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH- INMATES THERE- I WASN'T SEVERAL HOUSING AS WE HAVE INMATES WHO ARE PART OF OUR ENHANCE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM THERE YOU KNOW PARBAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. AND- THESE OFFICERS WAS DOING HI NICOLE THAT DATA. THESE OFFICERS DID REAL WELL IN IN IN GETTING PEOPLE TO WEAR THEIR MASKS- YOU KNOW KIND OF DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES. SO I KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT HAS MADE VALLEY STATE PRISON SO SUCCESSFUL WITH. CONTINUING THE NORWAY MODEL. IS THE EMPLOYEES THERE ARE WE HAVE A WHILE P. PROGRAM A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAM THERE AND NOW ONE OF THE OFFICERS I THINK YOU TESTIFIED HEARING LAST YEAR OFFICER ROBERT HERNANDEZ- HE'S GOT LIKE ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE YEARS IN THE APARTMENT AND HE AND I TALKED FOR AT THAT HEARING AND HE SAID YOU KNOW I WAS I ASKED MY SON YOU'VE BEEN DEPARTMENT LONG IN POWER IF YOU KEPT THIS. FIRE AND ENTHUSIASM TO WANT TO BE PART OF HELPING YOUNG YOU FOR MEN BE BETTER PEOPLE SO THAT WHEN THEY GO BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITY. THAT THEY ARE TAX PAYING CITIZENS. AND HIS BASIC DISCRIMINATE COACHING BY PEOPLE WHO BACK IN THAT PART OF WHAT A VERY CYNICAL NOW. THEY WERE TRYING TO RETIRE AND HE SAYS I I'VE SEEN PEOPLE CHANGE. BY US PROVIDING THEM REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND HE SAID I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO CAME IN WHO TOLD ME IT GETS WANTING TO POSSIBLY PROGRAM VALLEY STATE PRISON. ME TODAY MAKE THE CHANGES AND HE SAID THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT SOLD HIM THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE WHEN YOU GIVE. PEOPLE HOPE. AND EXPRESSED TO THEM THE NEED FOR THEM TO BE BETTER PEOPLE. SO HE HAS BEEN ABLE IN ALL TO CONDUCT. ON THE FACILITY HE WORKS ON TO TALK TO HIS PEERS OTHER CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND TO GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW OUR VISION AT IN OUR DEPARTMENT. AND VALLEY STATE PRISON AND HE TOLD ME HE SAID THERE WAS A COUPLE OFFICERS HAVE KIND OF REALLY WE'RE KIND OF YOU KNOW STICK. SPOT ON KNOWN WHERE THEY WERE AND HE SAID NOW THESE THESE IT THOSE TWO OFFICES IN THIS ONE BUILDING HE SAID. THEY ARE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT DOING THEIR PART IN ENCOURAGING YOUNG YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS AGO THEIR CLASSES. IS THEY MADE A TOTAL SHIFT IN THEIR MIND SET. SO AGAIN IT'S- WITH THE MODEL IS IT'S A IT'S A IT'S LIKE A- YOU HAVE LINES TO TAKE SO ONE THING IS A STAFF THE STAFF ENVIRONMENT AND THE AND THE STAFF ATTITUDE AT VALLEY STATE PRISON- IS VERY VERY GOOD AND THEY'RE THEY'RE FORWARD THINKING AND WHAT WE WERE OUR DEPARTMENT'S GOING. THEN WE HAVE THE ACTUAL INMATE POPULATION WHO HAS LEFT A GENERAL POPULATION YARD THE PRISON POLITICS HAS ELECTED TO NOT BE PART OF ALL THAT SELF DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR. AND THEN WE ADD THAT THE ACTUAL PROGRAMMING DAY INACTIVITY GROUPS WE HAD ALL THE EDUCATION THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WE AT COLLEGE THERE WE HAD THE TRAUMA INFORMED TREATMENT THERE IN IN THE FOURTH LEG OF THE TABLE. WHAT WE BELIEVE IS WITHOUT THIS ADDS SOME PHYSICAL THINGS THERE SO WE HAD THE PHYSICAL WHICH MEANS THIS MODULAR FURNITURE WHICH- IT'S COMP IS COMFORTABLE. M. AS IN NORWAY MODEL THEY'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE NOT JUST BEING IN PRISON LONG TERM LOOKING AT PEOPLE GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND SO IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO TIME WE'RE NOT SITTING AT METAL TABLES AND STEEL. STEEL CHAIRS IN A COMMUNITY WE HAVE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE AT A POOL REPORTER HOUSE YOU HAVE COMFORTABLE LOUNGE THINGS WITH YOUR BARBECUE YOU HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS THERE AND DAVE AS YOU SAY JACK EVER BEEN AND ALWAYS YOU BETTER THERE. THAT KINDA HELPS. WHERE THEY'RE MIMICKING IN THE NORWAY MODEL THEIR PRESENTS KIND OF WHAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO BASED UPON THAT I THINK IT'S A VERY VERY POSITIVE THING WE'RE DOING. WITH THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND I THINK WITH VALLEY STATE PRISON AS WELL AS THE OTHER FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE SELECTED. WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRULY TRULY TRYING TO THE BEST THAT THEY CAN THAT THINGS WILL WORK WELL. AND I NOTICED GIPSON IS WORKING- WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO LOOK AT SOME THINGS FOR STAFFING AND SO WE CAN KIND OF YOU KNOW. CONTINUE TO FOSTER I GUESS THE NORWAY MODEL OF HOW THEY ALL. WORK WITH THEIR STAFF AND HOW THEY TRAIN YOUR STAFF. YEAH A I WOULD JUST- URGE. THAT HI OF REPORT BACK IF WE'RE GONNA. OF BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE- I DON'T THINK. LEAVING IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL GOOD OFFICERS. NECESSARILY YOU KNOW IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THEIR THEIR PEERS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT UP IT'S GONNA BE MORE INTENTIONAL AND MORE DELIBERATE AS FAR AS WHAT'S EXPECTED OF OFFICERS- SO JUST YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR RESPONSE- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM- WHICH INDIVIDUALS WILL BE AND TO BE ABLE TO ENTER THE PROGRAM- DOES THAT INCLUDE. OF THOSE WITH TIME LEFTTO SERVE DOES THAT INCLUDE THOSE LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WHO IS IT AND HOW YOU DETERMINE WHO GETS ACCESS TO- THE AS OR WHAT EVER NEEDED TO GET THE BA. OKAY THE FIRST SERRA LARSEN MY COLLEAGUES. AND AFTER YOU MADAM CHAIR STERILIZED AND AGAIN FROM THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AT CDC ARE STILL THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON- ACCESS TO OUR VA PROGRAM IF FOLKS MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO THEY FUTURE MOST PREREQUISITE COURSES AT THE A LEVEL AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR PLACEMENT OF VALLEY STATE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM NOW VALLEY STATE ONLY SERVES A CERTAIN SECURITY LEVEL BUT WE DO HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL SECURITY LEVELS. AN ACT- INSTITUTIONS THAT HOW'S LIFERS AND I'LL AND- STUDENTS WITH A LOT STATUS SO THERE IS ACCESS FOR OUR STUDENTS KIND OF ACROSS ALL SECURITY LEVELS I'M AND ACROSS THOSE OTHER STATUS THERE'S TWO THAT BACHELOR'S LEVEL EDUCATION EVEN IF EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE SPECIFIC VALLEY STATE PROGRAM. BUT WE DO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND YOU KNOW WHAT MR SPEARMAN OVER IN OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ON GETTING FOLKS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR PLACEMENT OF VALLEY STATE AND ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM TRANSFERRED. TO RALLY SO THAT THEY CAN PROTECT EIGHT. PRIORITY FOR US TO MAKE SURE FOLKS WERE PUTTING EFFORT AND OF HAVE THAT LAW BEING TO WORK ON THEIR BACHELOR'S BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER TO AN INSTRUCTOR. I HAVE DOCTOR. OKAY IS THERE A LIMIT AS TO THE NUMBER- WHO CAN PART OF THE NUMBER THAT CAN PARTICIPATE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A CLASS SIZE OF ABOUT EIGHTY STUDENTS ONCE WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED- IN THAT AND THAT'S JUST BASED ON KIND OF LOOKING AT THE- NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE KIND OF REACHING THE ELIGIBILITY LEVEL. THAT WE THINK WILL BE ABLE TO SERVER AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S REALLY BASED ON WHO WHO IS REACHING OUT LEVEL OF BEING ABLE TO WORK ON MY BACHELOR'S. AND THAT'S EIGHTY OUT OF. WITH THE TOTAL POPULATION THERE. THE POPULATION I THINK THE MADAM CHAIRS BOUGHT A. TWENTY NINE HUNDRED. AND TO BE CLEAR THAT THE BACHELOR'S LEVEL EDUCATION IS ONE PROGRAM THAT WE OFFER IN THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WE ALSO HAVE MANY STUDENTS AT VALLEY STATE WHO ARE WORKING ON THEIR G. EACH YEAR OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WHO ARE WORKING ON ASSOCIATES LEVEL EDUCATION FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE THEM WITH PROFESSIONAL TRAINING- FOR UPON RELEASE. SO DOES ALL THOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT BE PARTICIPATING IN THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T YOU KNOW TAKEN THOSE PREREQUISITE CLASSES OR ACHIEVE THERE IS THOSE YET DEGREE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN ACADEMIC OR OR OTHER TYPES OF. EDUCATION PROGRAMS. OKAY AND ALL THE OTHER PHYSICAL THINGS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT- THE M. BESIDES THE FURNITURE OF THE MODULES FOR ACTIVITY GROUPS- THE PROGRAMS THE- CONSTRUCTION MICROPHONE CONSTRUCTION ALL OF THOSE WOULD BE. FOR THOSE EIGHTY PEOPLE IT WOULD BE FOR ANYBODY ELSE. SORRY I KNOW THAT BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM IS WHAT WE'VE WE'VE PEGS- FOR THAT NUMBER OF PURCHASE SPENDS THOSE EIGHTY PARTICIPANTS THERE BUT ALL OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS HAVE I'M KIND OF A PARTICIPANT SIZE BASED ON WHAT WE THINK WE CAN GET IN TERMS OF PETER'S INTO THOSE PROGRAMS THOUGH FOR THE MICRO HOME PROGRAM. WE REQUIRE SOME PREREQUISITE TRAINING AND OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACTING SKILLS BE THAT AGE TRACK FOR PLUMBING- OR CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT ARE ALL OF THOSE THINGS KIND OF WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD THE MICRO HOMES AND SO BASED ON THAT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT VALLEY STATE ROUTE COMPLETED THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS REBUILD THE MICRO HOME PROGRAM. I'M KIND OF BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS IN THAT PROGRAM AND WE CAN PROVIDE I'M BACK UP TO SHOW CAN OF WHAT THOSE PARTICIPATION NUMBERS LOOK LIKE FOR THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS THE MEDIA'S ROLE THAT WE'VE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING THAT MICRO HOMES PROGRAM THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE KIND OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT WILL BE PROVIDING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL AGENT HE AND WE CAN KIND. OF SHOW YOU WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE. OKAY THANK YOU- JUST A QUESTION ON THE STAFF COMPLAINT RELATED- ISSUES OF. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CDC ARE RECEIVED ALMOST TEN MILLION DOLLARS. GENERAL FUND AND FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS OF AND ON GOING TO IMPLEMENT A NEW REGIONAL MODEL FOR REVIEWING AND INVESTIGATING THE INMATE COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT- AND TO REVISE THE GRIEVANCE REVIEW PROCESS THE O. I. G. REPORT FOUND THESE RESOURCES WERE NOT DEPLOYED EFFICIENTLY AND PART OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE TIME TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. SO ARE THE RESOURCES REQUESTED IN THE MAY REVISION IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS GIVEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AMY MILLER- FUND DIVISION OF CORRECTIONS POLICY RESEARCH INTERNAL OVERSIGHT- THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES THAT THESE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE IN ADDITION TO THOSE RESOURCES THAT WE WERE GIVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ALLEGATION INCREMENTED INSPECTION- AND AS NOTED IN THE REPORT THAT THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL PUT OUT. OUR INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUIRIES INTO ALLEGATIONS BEING RECEIVED BY THAT UNIT- WAS MUCH. WAS WAS MUCH LONGER IT WAS TAKING AS MUCH LONGER TO COMPLETE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY. ASSUMED IT WOULD AND SO IN OUR NINETEEN TWENTY B. C. P. WE HAD ASSUMED IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HOURS PER IN CORRIE WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITS M. IN IN THAT FIRST SIX MONTHS OR SO WAS IT WAS ATUALLY TAKING US ALMOST THREE TIMES AS LONG TO CONDUCT AN INQUIRY WE DID IT BRING A PERSON INTO EVALUATE OUR PROCESSES AND BY EVALUATING THE PROCESSES OF THAT PARTICULAR UNIT WE HAVE SINCE THEN REDUCED THE TIME IT IS TAKING TO COMPLETE THOSE ENQUIRIES. AND WE'RE NOW DOWN TO ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS HER INQUIRY MORE OR LESS- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER EFFICIENCIES TO BE FOUND BUT JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS OF ALLEGATIONS SPECIFICALLY REGARDING PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT- ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF USE OF FORCE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF AND THEN OF COURSE THE- THE ARMSTRONG LITIGATION AND THE NEEDS FOR THOSE AREAS AS WELL WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. WE DID HOWEVER TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RESOURCES WE ALREADY HAD IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE WERE NOT ASKING FOR DUPLICATIVE RESOURCES OR DOUBLE COUNTING ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS. OKAY THANK YOU THE ONLY QUESTION ON THAT ON THE- NUMBER IN FRONT THE PAROLE. HERE WE GO UP THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS OF- YOU INCLUDE OF THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES- GENERAL FUND TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR VICTIMS DURING THE PAROLE HEARING PROCESS OF. AND THE- YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO- EXPAND THINGS LIKE THE VICTIM OFFENDER DIALOGUE PROGRAM I MEAN IT IT SEEMS TO ME AND I'VE MET WITH- CRIME SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES- THEY PLAY A REALLY IMPORTANT PART IN THE TRIAL AND THE ROLL PROCESSES UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THEIR INVOLVEMENT- LEADS TO- DAY MOTIONAL DISTRESS AND TRAUMA THAT AND TO REPEAT THAT. OF BUT WE HAVE OF WE SPEND MORE ON PRISONS THAT ACTUALLY ON THE VICTIMS AND SO IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE SERVICES FOR THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. OF BUT THAT INCLUDES- ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED VICTIM SERVICES AND SERVICES THAT PROVIDE- LONG TERM RESOURCES FOR THE VICTIMS SO THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY. HAVE MORE STABILITY AND ALSO- RECOVER- SO IT SEEMS TO ME IS- IT THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STAFF. WHAT WILL THEY FUNCTION THE SAME AS THE EXISTING STAFF OF LIKE TO SEE IF THERE ARE- ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE- WHAT IT IS EFFECTIVE RIGHT NOW WHAT'S BEING PROVIDED WHAT'S EFFECTIVE- IS A NEW FUNDING GOING TO SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED- AND HOW A DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE STAFF INTERFACE WITH. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO INTERACT WITH- SURVIVORS. I DON'T KNOW WHO COULD ANSWER THAT. SO JENNIFER SHAFER THE BORDER PATROL HEARINGS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THIS GROUP OF- ARMS THESE FIRST OF ALL OF THE OFFICE OF VICTIMS AND- SURVIVOR RIGHTS AND SERVICES DOES PROVIDE SERVICES TO VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS- FOR ALL AREAS OF CORRECTION SO THEY PROVIDE VITAL AND CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORRECTIONAL PROCESS. AS WELL AS BE DISCRETIONARY CALL HEARING PROCESS NIELSEN SESSIONS THE REQUESTED- BUDGET ARM FOR THE OFFICE OF VICTIM AND SURVIVOR RIGHTS AND SERVICES WILL HELP ENHANCE SO SERVICES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE DIRECT SERVICES THAT THE OFFICE CAN PROVIDE SPECIFICALLY TO VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS. WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE BOARD'S PAROLE HEARING PROCESS CURRENTLY THERE'S KIND OF A PATCHWORK OF- DIFFERENT PEOPLE INTERACT AND PROVIDE INFORMATION- IT VARIES BY COUNTY- SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW THE OFFICE TO PROACTIVELY REACH OUT. TO VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS WHO HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE OFFICE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PAROLE HEARING PROCESS WE THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT- PRIOR TO THE PAROLE HEARING TO LET THEM KNOW WHY THE PERSON IS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION. AND THEN WITH RESPECT RESOURCES YOU'RE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. HOPE GUARD TO PROVIDE RESEARCH ARE REFERENCES REFERRALS- TO BOTH STATE AND LOCAL VICTIM SERVICES IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL SPECIALIST PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY TRAUMATIC. SO THESE PARTICULAR LAYS SONGS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THIS PROPOSAL ARE SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO PROVIDE THOSE DIRECT SERVICES TO PERSONS GOING THROUGH THE PRO HEARING PROCESS AND IT WILL ALLOW- SOME OF THE EXISTING PERSONNEL THAT TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- UPON REQUEST CURRENTLY. TO ALSO BE ABLE TO- DEDICATE ADDITIONAL TIME TO THE VICTIM OFFENDER MEDIATED ARE OUR PROGRAM. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YEAH I JUST- YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S. THE REASON I MENTION THE- RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IS. IT ARE THESE SERVICES TO HELP MORE OF THE HEALING PROCESS OR IS THAT OKAY GET READYWE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS PAROLE HEARING AND YOU KNOW OF- NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING OUT FOR THE HEALING PROCESS OF THE VICTIMS. SO I AM IT IS I CAN SAY THAT IT'S DEFINITELY FOUNDED IN THE HEALING PORTION- AND- THAT SAID- EVERY VICTIM OR SURVIVOR THAT COMES TO A PAROLE HEARING ON MAY BE IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE AND SO THE FIRST FIRST AND FOREMOST THE PRIORITY IS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT. AND WHAT THE PROCESS IS ABOUT EXPLAINED FOR EXAMPLE- THE SCIENCE BEHIND ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND WHY WE HAVE USED THEIR HEARINGS EXPLAIN HOW- THE IMPACT OF LONG TERM INCARCERATION AND AGING AND PRESENT HAS ON SOMEBODY'S- RECIDIVISM AND ME CURRENT RECIDIVISM RATES MANY VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS WHO COME BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD ARE- VERY- CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY IF THIS PERSON IS RELEASED AND SO PART OF IT IS EXPLAINING. ARE THE OUTCOMES OF THE CURRENT PROCESS AND TRYING TO SORT OF PROVIDE THE CONTEXT IN WHICH A RELEASE OCCURS TODAY- FROM A PAROLE SUITABILITY HEARING IT'S ALSO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL STANDARDS AND WHAT THE BOARD IS LOOKING OUT PRIOR TO MAKING A FULL DETERMINATION AND THESE RAISONS. WOULD CERTAINLY HELP- BY ADDITIONAL EDGE THAT RESPECT. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACCEPT- MORE OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS SEES AND THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THOSE RESOURCES THESE LAYS ON CAN ALSO DEFINITELY PROVIDE THOSE REFERRALS AND ASSISTANCE. I WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL TO SAY THAT YES THEY WILL SUPPORT THAT HEALING PROCESS BUT I THINK IT'S REALISTIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE- THEY'RE NOT READY FOR THAT BUT PROVIDING MEANINGFUL INFORMATION. IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD TO HELPING PEOPLE GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE. IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACCEPT- A DIFFERENT RESOURCES FOR HEALING AND MOVING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU- MOST. WOMB. THE REDIRECTING OF THE FUNDING FROM- THE LEMONADE TO CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS- DO YOU HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF HOW THE RE DIRECTED SAVINGS WOULD GO TO ONE OF THE BEST PSYCHIATRY REGISTRY COST AND TO OTHER NON PSYCHIATRY REGISTRY COST YOU HAVE THAT. BREAK DOWN. GOOD AFTERNOON MELCHER- WE'LL BE LOOKING TO RETAIN ELEVEN POINT THREE FOR REGISTRY- COSTS AND TWENTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION FOR TO COVER STARTING WAGES OF OUR EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH STAFF. TIED TO OUR SEVEN DAY. OKAY. IT IS NEWMAN NORMAL THE PARK- ALL I'M SORRY I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T EVEN CALL ON PM. WELCOME SENATOR HOW ARE YOU. I'M SORRY OKAY I'M SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE ON WILL WELCOME YES GO AHEAD SAID IT CONTAINS LISTENING I'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING I GUESS OUR- IN THAT SENSE OKAY WELCOME TO THE GREAT GREAT JOB- ALL THE WAS QUESTION AND ANSWER I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- IT IS REALLY JUST A PROCESS QUESTION UNITS I HOPE IT DOESN'T SEEMS SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC BUT IN TERMS OF THE HEARINGS THIS IS PERFORMANCE SHAVER IN TERMS OF THE HEARINGS THEMSELVES- WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF- CONFIDENTIALITY OF THOSE HEARINGS ARE RECENTLY- EARNED. WAS WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY WHERE THERE WAS ACTUALLY A- YOU KNOW CAMERA FOOTAGE OF THE INSIDE OF THE HEARING IT IN A MAYBE. THE CARD KIND OF PROMPTED ME TO THINK COULD A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE SIT IN ON A- OR PRO HEARING OR OR IS THAT A CASE BY CASE WORKER MR. AN ARRANGEMENT. SO WE VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ARE WE VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE COME AND OBSERVE THE PRO HEARING PROCESS ARE WE ROUTINELY APPROVED FOR- OBSERVERS SO LONG AS THEY HAVE NO CONNECTION TO THE CASE. SO OUR PEOPLE NOW OBSERVE- BY VIDEO- PREVIOUSLY THEY USED TO OBSERVE IN HEARING BUT NOW IT OUR HEARINGS ARE BEING CONDUCTED BY VIDEO PEOPLE CANNOT SURVIVE VIDEO STE. SO IN OTHER WORDS OTHERS IN THE PROJECT ON ITS OWN LIKE VICTIMS OR- PEOPLE WITH CONNECTIONS TO THE CASE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES- ABOUT THAT- I I'M JUST UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWERS TO. A MEMBER OF THE STATE SENATE LIKE MYSELF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE CONSIDERED EIGHTY WHEN INTERESTED PARTY BUT- JUST A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OBSERVING. A PARTICULAR HEARINGS RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY I'M FOR AS THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS REALLY REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY SO WE DO WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO OBSERVE HEARING SO LONG AS THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME AND THEY DO NOT KNOW- ANY OTHER PERSONS THERE. AND YOU'RE CORRECT- APART FROM NEUTRAL OBSERVERS WE DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE. HAVE A STATUTORY RIGHT TO BE THERE AS WELL. IT THANK YOU FOR MUCH DEMAND COME. THANK YOU ADVENTURE THANK YOU AS WELL AND- I'M SORRY IT WAS A LITTLE LATE TODAY THERE WAS A- ANOTHER OFFICIAL GOVERNMENTAL DUTY THAT I HAD THIS HAPPEN SOMETIMES WITH THE WITH COMMITTEE TIMING SO I'M GLAD TO BE HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU JOINED- I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION- RIGHT NOW WE DON'T. WE'RE NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE STATE COULD IMPROVE ITS GRANT RATES CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT- WHETHER IT'S THE ENTRANCE INTENT IS TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG INCREASED GRANT RATES OR BOTH OR NONE. SO CURRENTLY THE PROPOSAL IS- FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SCHEDULE AND CONDUCT ALL REQUIRED HEARINGS. AS FAR AS PURPOSE WE- ATTEMPTING TO INCREASE THE GRANT GRANTS. I'M CURRENTLY OUR STANDARD IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON OPPOSES A CURRENT AND RESOURCE TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WE USE EVIDENCE BASED- PROCESSES FOR THAT AND WE- WE USE A STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK TO ARRIVE AT THAT CONCLUSION. AND THERE IS THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES THAT GO INTO. PSYCHOLOGISTS THINK TRY. MY VIDEO STOPPED. STE STE. CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME YES. OKAY I APOLOGIZE MY I THINK MY VIDEO WILL GO BACK ON IN JUST A MOMENT SO I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT. THERE WE GO. I'M D. CONCERN IS REALLY HOW THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS I SUPPOSE OF INCREASING GRANTS- ONE IS TO CHANGE THE STANDARD- BY WHICH WE DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY IS A CURRENT AND RESOURCE TO PUBLIC SAFETY HOWEVER I WOULD CAUTION THAT- BUT DIRECT RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD LIKELY BE AN INCREASING RECIDIVISM RATES. THE OTHER WAY OF. I HAVE TRYING TO INCREASE GRANT RATES WOULD BE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS TO EXPAND- THE COGNITIVE BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS FOR REHABILITATION- TO AS MANY PARTICIPANTS ARE AS MANY PERSONS WHO ARE INCARCERATED AS POSSIBLE. I HOPE THAT HELPS ANSWER THE QUESTION. IT YES IT CLARIFIES IT- IT WAS MENTIONED I GUESS IT WAS EARLIER TODAY THAT THE RESPONSE FROM JUDGES. OF. THE NOTICES THAT WERE SENT OUT THE JUDGES AND THE RESPONSE WAS LIKE TWO HUNDRED IS THAT. TWO HUNDRED OUT OF THE ORDINARY BELIEVE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT IS OR- WHAT CAN BE DONE THAT. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THAT YES ONE IS. YOU KNOW WHEN THESE LAWS WERE WRITTEN- I'M JUST GUESSING THAT- TERMS OF INCARCERATION WERE MUCH SHORTER. SO CURRENTLY- THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT SOMEBODY HAS TO SERVE PRIOR ON AVERAGE- PRIOR TO BEING ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE SUITABILITY HEARING IS FIFTEEN YEARS. SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF A JUDGE WHO WAS SITTING AT SENTENCING TO STILL BE ON THE BENCH I AM FIFTEEN YEARS LATER OR UPWARDS OF SOMETIMES TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS THIRTY YEARS IS VERY UNLIKELY. SO I THINK THAT THAT HAS FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFTED SINCE THE LAW WAS PUT INTO A INTO A FACT THE OTHER THING IS THAT- OUT YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF CASES THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CASES ARE RESOLVED BY JURY ARE- BY PLEA AGREEMENT. SO INFORMATION THAT IS GAINED AT SENTENCING- MAY NOT BE REALLY ANYTHING MORE- MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WHAT WE GET FROM A PROBATION OFFICER'S REPORT OR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS OR- THE FRANKLIN HEARING I DOCUMENTS IT RECEIVES FOR USE OF FIVE OR SO A LOT OF THE INFORMATION IS DUPLICATIVE. OF WHAT WE RECEIVE ANYWAY AND THEN LAST- ONE THING THAT HAS CHANGED IS OUR LEGAL STANDARD- PREVIOUSLY IT WAS PERMISSIBLE TO THE BOARD NOT TALKING A COUPLE DECADES AGO IT WAS PERMISSIBLE FOR THE BOARD TO DENY SOMEBODY POLL BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THEIR OFFENSE. YOU CAN IMAGINE UNDER THAT PARA DYING THAT THE SEVERITY FACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF THE OFFENSE WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE BOARD TO CONSIDER. NOW IN THE WAKE OF SIGNIFICANT- LET LET JUST MEDICATION AND SOME LEGISLATION- OUR STANDARD IS WHETHER THE PERSON POSES A CURRENT AND REGIONAL RISK TODAY AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS WHO IS THE PERSON TODAY YES WHO WERE THEY WERE. BACK THEN BUT WHO ARE THEY TODAY AND HOW THEY CHANGED. AND SO THE- OF OUR HERE HAS ALL CHIU SIGNIFICANTLY SO I'M NOT- AT I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE JUDICIARY OR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE GOVERNED THE SENTENCING HEARING- TWO DECADES AGO. BUT CHANCES ARE THE FOCUS OF OUR HEARING IS NOT GOING TO BE THE INFORMATION THAT A JUDGE WOULD HAVE FROM TWENTY YEARS PRIOR I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE YES. CERTAINLY OKAY- SENATOR NEWMAN YOU HAD. I THANK YES MA'AM SURE I ITEM QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY AROUND TIME I THINK IT'S ITEM ELEVEN- MAYBE IT OVERLAPS WITH I'M SIXTEEN WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE- THE HEAD COUNT FOR THE P. I. P. SECTION OF THE B. C. P. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS PROBABLY STARTING WITH MISTER SWANSON I THINK- AND SPECIFICALLY. AS YOU LOOK THROUGH THE B. C. P. EITHER THERE THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT CHANGES IN HEAD COUNT- YOU KNOW MOSTLY MINOR BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE PSYCH TECH SECTION- THERE'S A VERY LARGE DECREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR FOUR OH FIVE TWO TWO HUNDRED TEN. SO IF YOU COULD GIVE US LIFTED LITTLE INSIGHT AS TO WHY. GOOD AFTERNOON. OKAY WHEN. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON- THIS DOING READER AGAIN DEBBIE DIRECTOR- YOU KNOW THE SHIFTING AND RESOURCES FROM- PSYCH TECHS. AFTER MARKERS- TO THE BASELINE OPERATIONS OUT THERE. ONE OF THE THINGS- THAT WAS ADDED INTO C. H. YOU HAVE WAS- SOME CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS TO TAKE ON SOME OF THAT WORK LOAD- THEY ALSO HAD- SOME PEACH SHE'S DOING SOME ESCORT WORK- WHICH WE'VE REPLACED WITH CUSTODY OFFICERS- WHICH IS MORE APPROPRIATE. AND WE'VE ALSO ENHANCED OUR IN STAFFING SO WE'VE INCREASED- THE R. ENDS OUT THERE AS WELL- BUT BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN. TO THE MODELING AND THEN WORKING WITH THE INSTITUTION- TO DETERMINE. WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT THEIR NEEDS- AND MEET THEIR PATIENT NEEDS- FOR THAT POPULATION- WE REALIZE THAT IT IS. A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION- BUT WE'VE COUNTERED THAT WITH- ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS- THAT ARE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SOME OF THAT WORKLOAD. SHOWS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE ARE SUBJECTS THAT ARE ALL THE REPRESENTED THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I AND. THAT DURING THE- YEAH THEY THEY KNOW WORK WITH WORKING OVERTIME EVEN AS THEY TOOK PERCENT PAY CUTS. SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A EXT. SHE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THAT- TO ALMOST WRITTEN REDUCE IT BY HALF- INITIAL EIGHT EMPLOYED BY THE LOT WHERE THE WHERE THOSE POSITIONS LOCATED. BOTH THE BALL OF THOSE POSITIONS LOCATED EACH YEAR INSP. AT THE HEALTH FACILITY. AND SO. MANY IF PRINCE THERE. BUT WE CAN THE WORK WAS NEW DURING THE PANTO- AGAIN SEEMS REALLY DRASTIC TO REDO THAT WORK BY. AND SO- I MEAN I GUESS YOU'VE COME. ON IT ALREADY BUT I HAVE SHOULD HERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE. SERVE ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A I'D I'D BE GRATEFUL BUT- THIS STAND OUT TO ME IS SO. THAT A- READ SEVERE VILLE AS- A SHARE OF YOUR- THAT WAS. PROBABLY NOT EXPECTING AND ISN'T IN I GUESS WOULD ASK YOU. ARE THERE TO RE. ANY OF THOSE TECH TO OTHER FISH. ARE YOU SIMPLY PUT ON LIMITING THOSE. OF COURSE NOT- WILL THROUGH A- TO VOLUNTARY TRANSFER IS YOU KNOW I'M FINE HOMES FOR STAFF. AS AS MUCH AS- AND- WE WILL WILL BE MORE- WITH INSTITUTE TO WORK THROUGH THAT CHANGE. IT WON'T BE- THERE'S PROCESS THAT WE GO WITH THE YOU. AND- KELLY- TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE SHOULD AND REESE. AND APPRECIATE SO. SURE I'D I'D LIKE LITTLE MORE INTO INTO THAT IF YOU. OF THIS BUT BE SHE- THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU. NO I THANK YOU FOR REYES THE ISSUE- CENTER- BECAUSE- IT'S NOT ALL FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD. NOW BUT IT'S ALL. THE ELEMENT OF BILLS POSITIONS- YOU KNOW AND THE PEOPLE TAKE THEM THEN. DON'T HAVE THIS TO. THAT THE PRIOR- EMPLOYEES DID. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT- I JUST WANNA- JUST MAKE A I INTO OF GOING BACK TO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY AND OF THE THAT. WERE IMPACTED. BY OF THE NUMBER OF CLOSURES- WE'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THIS- ISSUE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION WATER THAN NOT WE COULD GET THE INFORMATION. BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME PLANNING PROCESS SOMEWHERE THAT'S TAKING PLACE WITH REGARDS TO OUR FUTURE CLOSURES OF PRISONS- AND NOW PUTTING US IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO AGREE. TO CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND- OFF AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THE CAMERAS WHERE DO YOU PUT THOSE- WE'VE GOTTA COME TO SOMETHING HERE THAT MAKES SENSE THAT. ALLOWS FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT- WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW AS LEGISLATORS SO THAT WECAN MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE AND NOT I REMEMBER HEARING THIS AND ARE VERY FOR. IT WAS OUR VERY FIRST HEARING A WITH THIS CAME UP AND WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A PLAN WHERE DO WE SEE OURSELVES GOING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS- A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS. AS TO HOW TO SPEND OUR- OUR DOLLARS ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A- NEED FOR A FINAL COMMENT BUT I REALLY FEEL IT KEEPS COMING UP IT KEEPS COMING UP. AND WE KEEP GETTING PUSHED BACK THAT- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DO THAT- MOSTLY COMING FROM I THINK DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE. ANYBODY FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE INSTEAD DRESS THAT. SENATOR LET ME START OFF FOR A C. D. C. ARE. JUST THAT ARE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND ASSEMBLY STAFF ON- ARE COMING UP WITH A- A LANGUAGE THAT EVERYBODY CAN LIVE WITH IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF HOW WE- IDENTIFY PRISONS FOR CLOSURE AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT BUT THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE- WE DO- LOOK AT THESE ISSUES ALL THE TIME AND WE MAKE SURE. PART OF I COULDN'T TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS LEAVEA LITTLE BIT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY PRIORITIZE PROJECTS BUT CERTAINLY WE ARE PUTTING FORTH PROJECTS THAT ARE. MOST IMPORTANT FOR- FOR PRISONS IN YOU KNOW JUST TO MEET THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE INMATES ABOUT THE STAFF IN GENERAL RIGHT. AND I AM ARE YOU APPRECIATE THAT I UNDERSTAND MAYBE THINGS GET SO BAD BEFORE WE FINALLY DO THE WHARTON'S MORE IN FEES CAPITAL OUTLAYS- PROJECTS BY COURT ORDER. THE CARD BY COURT ORDER. OR IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT IMPROVE. FRIEDMAN ROBIN FIRST OF F. OF THE FOUR MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL THAT THEY THINK AND THAT MADE. ARE COURT RELATED TO COURT. AND ALSO THE- SEE H. C. A. ONE RELATED SUPPORT OR- IT'S REALLY TO A THAT CAME OUT IN JANUARY. YEAH I MEAN I WANT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT. COURT ORDERS UNDER. BUT THE- THAT'S THE- OF SIT. WEEK GETTING. A PUSHED IN. OUR JUST WANNA. GO BACK- MISS SHAVE- YOU'RE- SOMETHING IN ABOUT- THE HEARING. AND THAT OF. IN THE GRANT RAY WOULD LEAD TO INCREASED OF. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT SOME WHITE WHY DO BELIEVE THAT. WELL CURRENTLY- YOU KNOW WE- THERE'S NO OF TESTING- REALLY TO RATE WOULD BE OF PEOPLE WHO WORK ON COURSE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY CANNOT RIGHT YOU HAVE TAX REALLY FOLKS TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE RATES- WOULD BE. AND SO IN I THE MARQUEE YOU REALLY THE MORE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE FOR INCREASE AND RECIDIVISM RATES ARE CURRENT RECIDIVISM RATE USING THE STANDARD THAT WE USE NOW IS AS I SAID GENERAL RECIDIVISM IT'S- TWO TO FIVE. OR PERSONS RE- HAVE A NEW CAN WITHIN THREE YEARS AND WHICH LESS THAN 1% HAVE A NEW CONVICTION FOR A- WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A VIOLIN THE FLUTE AS AN OFFENSIVE- ANOTHER PERSON. SO THE RECIDIVISM RATES ARE VERY LOW- YOU CAN EXPECT THAT IF WE- IF WE INCREASED OR I SHOULD SAY LOWERED- THE STANDARD FOR WHO GETS RELEASED AND- IT WOULD POTENTIALLY AND LIKELY. RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN RECIDIVISM RATES. IN STORE CLEAN WHAT WE FIND FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS IS THAT- AND IT'S A IT'S A POLICY. WHEN YOU HAVE SOME WHO CAN OF VERY SERIOUS CRIME SUCH AS MURDER AND RAPE MAN'S. THERE TENDS TO BE VERY LOW TO. FOR RE. ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SERVING A TERM THAT CANNING. OR DID THE SENTENCE INCLUDED. NOTE TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE AND SO IF SOMEBODY'S RELEASED- PRIOR TO THE END OF THEIR LIFE AND THEY GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING- A VIOLENT- TOWARD SOMEBODY AGAIN. HISTORICALLY THERE'S BEEN LITTLE TOO FOR THAT AND SO I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR POLICYMAKERS IS REALLY- WHAT LEVEL OF RECIDIVISM- IS APPROPRIATE- FOR PERSONS WHO ARE SENTENCED TO LIFE TERMS. OKAY WILK. I'M NOT SURE WHEN YOU SAY THIS- IT HELLO IN THE STAND IS FAR STANDARD CHANGE US MEAN THAT WE'RE IN STANDARD- BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDER IT A REAL IMPORTANT PART OF. THE PAROLE- HEARING. WITH WHAT WE EXPECT OUT OF- WE LOOK AT WORK FLOW WHAT WE OUT OF THEM AND- WE GOING THE MOST AND EXPECTS THAT ARE- IT WILL NOT BE A BIT ODD TO DO. AS YOU SAID- LET'S HAS LAWS OF CONSIDERING OF FROM SEVERAL AGO AND PART OF THAT IS BIG OF WE BELIEVE MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY TO BE RELEASED AND HAVE CHANGED THEIR LIVES SO- I GUESS. YOU KNOW USE TERMS LIKE LOW THE STE THE STAN. AND RECIDIVISM WILL INCREASE IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SHARING WITH US. I WELL WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE A SUBSET OF PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINEDLY SENTENCED THEY WERE DETERMINEDLY SENTENCE BUT THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION HEARING. AND WE'RE JUST NOW GATHERING THE DATA ON THEIR RECIDIVISM THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED PAROLE AND SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED AS A RESULT OF THE DETERMINANT TERM SO FOR THE FIRST TIME- WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO COMPARE- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOLKS WHO ARE APPROVED FOR RELEASE. AND THEIR RECIDIVISM RATES AND THE FOLKS THAT WERE DENIED A RELEASE BUT IT'S VERY PRELIMINARY. ARE AS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENTS RECIDIVISM IS BASED ON THREE YEARS OF FOLLOW UP AFTER RELEASE AND THE LAWS GOVERNING PROEHL DISK RUSSIAN AREA DECISION. ARE PRO FOR DETERMINE SENT PURSE DO NOT GOING TO US INTEL- REALLY TWENTY. IS WHEN THEY FOR STARTED REALLY SO THEY A VERY VERY NUMBER. BUT I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WILL HAVE THAT SORT OF COMPARISON AVAILABLE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. THIRTY CENTER COURT. THE QUESTION- OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SWANSON THANK YOU- FOR SPIN A LONG TIME BUT I THINK IT WELL WORTH ALL OF OUR THE PRESENT THAT YOU MADE AS AS A AND OUR QUESTION THANK YOU- WE GO NOW TO ISSUE SAID.

MADAM CHAIR THAT SAYS ACTUALLY HARPER DOJ AGAIN- IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION REGARDING TWO SIX NINE NINE AND THE- INITIAL APPROPRIATIONS ANNOUNCES THAT SITES COSTS AND THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS- WE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT- THE FLOOR ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS- THAT WAS- DONE ON. AT A POINT IN TIME OF THE BILLS- LANGUAGE- THE LANGUAGE CONTEMPLATING A NEW DATABASE WAS NOT AMENDED INTO THE BILL UNTIL AUGUST TENTH TWENTY TWENTY AND THE RELEVANT APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS BUT- I BELIEVE YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO HERE IS DATED PRIOR TO THOSE AMENDMENTS APPEARING IN PRINT- THE BILL WAS NOT MADE EXPLICITLY RETROACTIVE UNTIL AUGUST TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY- WHICH WAS AFTER THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS HEARING WAS HELD. ON AUGUST TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY- BASED ON THIS TIMELINE DOJ- HAD ONLY TEN DAYS WITH SUBSTANTIAL UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS- AND DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO REPORT FISCAL PRIOR TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ANALYSIS DEADLINE A FOR THE BILL'S HEARING ON AUGUST TWENTIETH- AS A RESULT WE COMPLETEDTHE ANALYSIS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH THAT AUGUST TWENTIETH AND AUGUST TWENTY FIFTH AMENDMENTS- THE LATTER OF WHICH CONTEMPLATED RETROACTIVITY.

AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M TO DISCUSS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF DROZ- FOR THE WORK LET'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ELLIE- TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT DRESS WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE UNSOURCED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF COLLEAGUES SENATORS. CORTESE'S CENTER COURTESY YES I THINK MAKING SURE- I GUESS FOR MISS HARPER IN THIS MAY BE I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE- THAT YOU HAVESOME KIND OF A CORD AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- THIS THIS IS NOT. WELL JUST ISSUES QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW I KNOW THE- AB TWO SO TWENTY SIX NINE NINE. MR HATTA CATCHY HAD NINE OF. UNSAFE FIREARMS- RELATING TO BILL OPENS UP A GOOD BY THE WAY WAS ADOPTED BEFORE I GOT HERE- YOU KNOW WITH- WITH THAT REFERENCE THAT TERM ON SAFE ARMS WHICH OF COURSE CARRIED OVER. INTO THIS BUDGET ANALYSIS TODAY THE BILL JUST SAYS ON STATE FARM SAYS DEFINED- IN A BEEN WORRIED FOR TACTICAL PURPOSES HOW IT'S DEFINED IN IN THERE FOR. IN THIS EFFORT TO. CREATE OR OR MERGE DATABASES WHAT DATABASES WILL BE INVOLVED OR IMPLICATED IN THAT PROCESS. LET ME JUST SAY AYE AYE AYE AGAIN THE GENERIC TITLE IN SIMPLER TERMS CAN BE TAKEN FROM ONE EXTREME TO ANOTHER AS- NO SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP N. A RURAL ENVIRONMENT- WE WERE ALWAYS TARGET ALL FIREARMS ARE UNSAFE- THEY MAY BE ABLE TO BE HANDLED SAFELY BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SAFE FIREARMS AND REALLY ASKING THIS AS A SPECIFIC QUESTION I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE DEFINITION BUT WHAT IS THE DEFINITION FOR PURPOSES OF STATUTE- FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF SHAMANS FOR EXAMPLE FARMS- YOU KNOW I KINDA KNOW SOME OF THE CATEGORIES AND- I COULD BE IN THE DEFINITION. BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY DEFINITION. YES SENATOR- WE DO HAVE ALISON MENDOZA ON THE LINE FROM OUR BUREAU OF FIREARMS AND WHO MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU WITH THAT QUESTION. MENDOZA WITH THE BUREAU OF FIREARMS. AND NEXT SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A ROSTER OF NOT AND STATE HAND THEN SEND THESE FIREARMS GO THROUGH THESE HANDGUNS GO THROUGH A SERIES OF TESTING BY CERTIFIED LABS. AND THEY HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THERE'S CERTAIN TESTING WAS FAR AS DROP TESTING. AND BROADCASTING FIVE TEST AND IS- AND ARE LISTED ON OUR ROSTER IF NOT AND YOU CAN'T GAINES. B. AND UNSAFE HANDGUNS AT THIS BILL REFERRING TO ARE HAND GUNS THAT HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. DOES THAT MAKE TESTING BY THE CERTIFIED LAB. IN HOW IS IT. THAT THE- YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M LISTENING. IRWIN READING THIS IN THE PARAGRAPH HERE- IN OUR PACKETS HOW IS IT THAT A FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARM DEALER. I WOULD END UP HAVING ONE OF THOSE FOR SALE IN THEIR STORE IS SET. IS THAT SOME KIND OF. IMPLICIT PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE NOT HONORING THE STATUTE IN THE FIRST PLACE- IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE SELLING. I'M SURE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE- NO WORDS WERE ACROSS THIS IS BREAKING DOWN THE SPEED OF A STATUTE THAT SAYS STATE. ARKET THE HANDGUN ISN'T PROPERLY TESTED ITS ON STATE IT SHOULD BE SOLD- DON'T WE HAVE WHILE ASIAN OF ALL RIGHT AT THE MOMENT THE SOMEBODY DECIDES TO GO AND SELL IT AND PRESUMABLY. TO VOTE AGAIN WE'RE GOING FOR DATABASE PURPOSES WOULD BE THROWING LICENSE. TO YOURS IS DISCOVERED A PROBLEM IS. THE AT THE REQUIREMENTS CAN DIFFERENT TYPES OF FIRE IT'S ALL DEPENDENT ON PURCHASING THEM SO THE ROSTER THAT WE HAVE FOR THE NOT- OUR- OUR CLIENTS THAT CAN BE SOLD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS CERTAIN EXTENSIONS THAT THEY CAN JUST BANDS THAT ARE AT THE END CAMPAIGNS THAT WE'RE JUST ASKING ONE SIX NINETY NINE. THIS IS SO YOU'RE SAYING IS THEY COULD BE SOLD BUT ONLY TO CERTAIN FIRES. YEAH THEY'RE BEING SOLD TO NON PERMITTED BUYERS UNDER THE STATUTE- THERE NEEDS TO BE THIS ALREADY PROCESS IN THE SORT OF DATABASE DEVELOPMENT- TO TRACK WITH THAT'S OCCURRING INTO INTO TO ENFORCEMENT IT IS AT THAT LEVEL. THERE'S A LOT MORE TO RIGHT I'M SORRY NEED TO CUT YOU OFF AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AS AN AGENCY CAN BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE MANUFACTURER IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT RECORDED WITHIN OUR- TRUST OUR DEAL RECORD OF SALES SYSTEM. AND AGENCIES WOULD ENSURE THAT INFORMATION INTO THE AUTOMATED FIRE SYSTEM WITHIN TEN DAYS OR STATUTES. WE HAVE NO DRONES RECORD AT THIS TRANSACTIONS- SO THAT THAT'S ONE AREA OF THE AUDIT THAT WE WOULD NEED TO GO INTO THOSE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO ACQUIRE THAT INFORMATION. AND THERE'S ALSO- THAT TRANSFERS THAT OCCUR PRIVATE PARTY. TRANSFERS IN BETWEEN THIS ALLOWS FOR CERTAIN I OF AGENTS TO TRAIN CERTAIN THAT'S TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES. AND IN THAT IN THAT DRESS ENTRY SYSTEM WHEN THEY ARE CONNECTING TO TRANSACTIONS WE DO CHECK FOR CERTAIN OR THE DEALER CHECKS FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS- AND THAT INFORMATION. IS USED TO ALLOW CERTAIN AND THEN TRANSACTIONS TO OCCUR THE SYSTEM HOWEVER THAT IS NOT ROUTINE IN THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS ABILITY OUT. THIS TIME IT'S ONLY AT THE TIME THAT THE TRANSACTION- AND HOW DOES FALL OFF AND THE ROSTER ALL THE TIMES THAT ROSTER CHANGES IT COULD CHANGE STATE. SO THIS LITERALLY IS THIS. DEFINITION IF YOU WILL- WARM THIS. IS LITERALLY A LIST OF HARDWARE IT'S NOT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH. PERSONS WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE CERTAIN RECORDS LIKE FELONIES LIKE THREW THAT OUT THERE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THIS IS LITERALLY A LIST OF. HARDWARE PRODUCTS BUT A WAY TO PUT IT- IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL FIREARMS THEMSELVES WHAT WHAT'S OKAY WHAT'S SAFE WHAT'S NOT OKAY OKAY IN IN THE EYES OF. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INSTEAD GET I'M JUST TRYING TO ACT OF LISTENING SAYS ONE LONGTIME HEARING THIS CORRECTLY. ROSTER THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS IS THAT A HANDGUN THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT SAFETY TESTING BY THE CERTIFIED LABS. I'M BETTER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND MOST OF THOSE HANDGUNS HAVE BEEN ON THE ROSTER FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE ADDED. AND HE NEW AND GUNS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. I'M SUCH AS THE BACKGROUND THESE AND THE CHAMBER LOAD INDICATOR MY BREASTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON THE ROSTER THAT WE MAINTAIN IT'S REALLY. FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC NOT OR- LAMPARD'S. RIGHT IN INTO WE DO WE AT THIS POINT HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO HAVE ANY IDEA- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH INCIDENTS OF HARM. IS COMING FROM. THE SALE OR TRANSACTION OF THE OF THE ROSTER OF FIREARMS FROM THIS ROSTER TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR IS THAT PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP WITH THIS DATABASE- SOME SOME TRACKING OF. WHATEVER WHO DROPS A GUN ON THE GROUND AND THEN SOMEBODY GETS SHOT IT. IS DO WE KNOW WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT PROBLEM ACTUALLY IS IN TERMS OF INCIDENTS. I I'M SORRY I DO NOT. AND SHALL NOT IN THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT TRACK. THAT ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED. IT WOULD BE EIGHTY TRACKING OF- BOUGHT A FIREARM OUT AND WE'RE JUST WHETHER IT WAS ON THE ROSTER NOT ON THE ROSTER SEARCH. ENGINES ON THE TRANSFERRING BETWEEN AGENCIES CRACKS OR WHO HAS POSSESSION AND OWNERSHIP. RIGHT RIGHT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ONE. ACCIDENTAL DEATH FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE ONE TO MANY OF COURSE BUT- LIKE IT OR NOT WE'RE IN THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS SO WERE ONE GOING HERE IS TO REALLY KNOW. HOW MUCH BENEFIT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE COST IN TERMS OF. OF INADVERTENT OR ACCIDENTAL HARM. ASSEMBLY THAT'S WHAT MOST OF THE HARM IF SOMEONE WANTED TO INTENTIONALLY HURT SOMEONE IT WILL MATTER MUCH IT WAS A FIREARM ON THIS LIST IN MY OPINION OR FARM THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST. BUT THEY HEARD SOMEBODY WITH A HEARD SOMEBODY WITH IT BUT- IT SOUNDS LIKE- ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE. YOU KNOW OTHER UNSAFE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE FARM THAT WE SHOULD BECAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL DEATH IS WHAT. FOLKS WERE AFTER WITH THE INTENT OF THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO S. WERE LITTLE BIT DOWNSTREAM YOUR- OUT. MISSION WE ALSO ALREADY- OR SUGGESTING TO SOME DEGREE THE SO THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF ME ASKING. NO OVERTIME. AND SO I'M I'M JUST EXPLAINING WHY I'M ASKING THIS QUESTION SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW BUT MAYBE SOMETHING. FOR ME THAT I WANT TO BRING BACK CAN. IN ASKED WE TAKE A LOOK AT LATER ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER COURTESY- NOR SENATOR NEWMAN WE'RE GOOD OKAY- SO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN- THIS IS THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY BY THE WAY THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO WAS JUST UP WITH THIS- THIS IS THE- BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. ISSUES SEVEN THIS WILL BE THE FINAL DISCUSSION ITEM ON THE BSE SEES. MAY REVISION PROPOSALS AND ADJUSTMENTS I ALSO LIKE TO ASK- WHO WILL BE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF- BE. SEE AN AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THIS IS KATIE HOWARD I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PSEC HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME ALL RIGHT- I'M ALSO HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE RECORDED THE BRIDGE IF THERE ARE ANY DETAILED QUESTIONS ON THE CALVET PROPOSAL- AND SO I WANTED TO START I'LL JUST GIVE A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY OF ALL FOUR ITEMS AND THEN THERE. MAY BE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER THAT- WITH THE CHURCH PERMISSION SO STARTING ON THE CAL THIS ITEM- CAL THAT THIS THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN THE PSEC HAS ADMINISTERED THIS GRANT. FOR ABOUT THE LAST TEN YEARS THE MAY REVISE PROPOSAL WOULD ADD TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. AND THAT ONE TIME INCREASE WILL BE SPREAD OUT OVER THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS IN ADDITION THERE ARE TWO OTHER PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES TO HELP THEM IN THIS PROPOSAL FIRST. IT INCREASES THE CAP ON INDIVIDUAL GRANTS SO A PROJECT COULD RECEIVE UP TO SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR A THREE YEAR GRANT AND THAT COMPARES TO A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND NUMBER TWO IT DIRECTED THE SEC TO GIVE PREFERENCE TO PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS REDUCING VIOLENCE INVOLVING YOUTHS AGED. FOURTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE- AGAIN WHILST WILL STOP THE END FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR FURTHER DETAIL YOU MAY WANT HERE ON THIS- THE NEXT NIGHT THE NEXT TWO ITEMS ON THE LIST ARE MORE TECHNICAL IN NATURE. SO THE MAY REVISED- INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROP FORTY SEVEN FUNDING- THEN THAT'S ONE OF THE GRANT THAT THE SEC ADMINISTERS AND THERE'S A CALCULATION THAT GOES INTO THAT AMOUNT AND- THERE IS AN INCREASE OF. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ME REVISED- D. O. F. IS BETTER EQUIPPED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT ONE. ITEM THREE IS P. R. C. S. OR POST CAN POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AND- THERE IS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INCREASE OF TWENTY THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS THERE. AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY THE- ITEM FOR WHICH IS A PROPOSAL TO DECREASE LEASE REVENUE FINANCING AUTHORITY FOR COUNTY JAIL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS- IN THE AMOUNT OF JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE NINE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THOSE AMOUNTS COME FROM SEVERAL COUNTIES AWARD RELINQUISHMENT- AND AWARDED FUNDS FOR JAIL CONSTRUCTION- AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THERE IS A SEPARATE AND RELATED ACTION TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES INSTEAD. TWO GRANTS THAT WOULD EXPAND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS YOU ARE SYSTEM INVOLVED- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE FOUR SEPARATE COUNTY JAIL FINANCING PROGRAMS SO THIS RELINQUISHMENT PROPOSAL. AFFECTS BOTH THE BSE C. BUDGET. AND OF THE CDC ARE BUDGET. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY THAT YOU HAVE AND AS I MY COLLEAGUE RECORDED REACH IS HERE. FOR CALVET. OKAY LET'S SEE CAN WE HAVE THE L.

I HAVE NO PROBLEM- WILL TAKE MAX FIVE MINUTES MAX. OKAY. WE ARE NOW MOVING TO PART B. WHICH WILL COVER LABOR AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES LET'S BEGIN WITH YOUR ISSUE ONE WHICH IS THE E. D. D. DEFERRED IN PERSPECTIVE WORKLOADS- OF COOL WILL PRESENT ON BEHALF OF. EDT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THIS IS JULIE STILL UP. THE LABOR AGENCY I THINK YOU CAN HEAR ME YES YES WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR GOOD TO SEE YOU SEE YOU TOO CLEARLY THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT FOR LIGHTWEIGHTS ONLY THOSE WHO CAN. GO THE DISTANCE ALLOWED- MADAM CHAIR I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO WORKING PEOPLE I'VE BEEN SHAPED BY YOUR WORK FOR DECADES AS OF AS HAVE SO MANY OTHERS I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ITEMS RELATED TO THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AGENCY LISTED IN THE AGENDA HAS SO. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE WITH ISSUES WERE THROUGH SIX. THESE AND ITEM LIVE UNDER CHEST OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFF OF THIS AND I CAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH WHICH ARE ALL PART OF A COHESIVE VISION FOR HOW WE RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC BETTER THAN WE ENTER. AND BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT IS NOT ONLY CHARACTERIZED BY GROWTH AND PROSPERITY BUT ALSO BY EQUITY RESILIENCE AND CARBON NEUTRALITY WHAT WE CALL A HIGH ROAD ECONOMY. AND THEN MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE AS WELL TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THESE ITEMS. BUT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE PARTNERS TO US DURING THIS DIFFICULT YEAR A YEAR WERE CALIFORNIA CAME TOGETHER BUT THE STEPS THAT WE HAD TO TAKE TO STOP THE SPREAD OF CODED. THAT TO SAVE LIVES HAVE REALLY- REQUIRED COLLECTIVE SACRIFICE AND THE SACRIFICES LIKE THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ITSELF WERE NOT BORN EQUALLY. WORKERS OF COLOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WOMEN HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. BUSINESSES AND IN SOME CASES ENTIRE INDUSTRIES WERE SHUT DOWN AND WORKERS HAVE PAID THE PRICE BOTH ON THE FRONT LINES AND IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE. WE NEED BUDGET INVESTMENTS THAT ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES HEAD ON- TO START WITH THE ITEM THAT YOU MENTIONED MADAM CHAIRWOMAN I KNOW YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT UNEMPLOYED WORKERS HAVE FACED ALL OF US NOT JUST MY TEAM AT THE LABOR AGENCY BUT ALSO YUR STAFF. HAVE WORKED COLLECTIVELY WITH EDT TO ADDRESS THEM AND THIS WORK OF COURSE IS ONGOING AND THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND SHORTCOMINGS THAT PRE DATED THE PANDEMIC. WHAT WERE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE BY IT. AND THIS INCLUDES A BENEFITS SYSTEMS OF MODERNIZATION WHAT WHAT LET LET ME LET ME FIRST MENTION ITEM YOU YOU YOU SAID MONTREAL MOST IT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR DEFERRED WORKLOAD THIS IS WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC SEARCH AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT WORKLOAD IN AS TIMELY A FASHION AS IS POSSIBLE. IT ALSO INCLUDES BILL BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION THIS IS AN INVESTMENT THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW ET DE TO ENGAGE IN THE PLANNING NEEDED TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT IS RELIABLE. AND FLEXIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR MOMENTS OF EXTREME CRISIS AS THIS LAST YEAR HAS BEEN BUT ALSO FOR WHENEVER SOMEONE NEEDS IT RIGHT UNEMPLOYMENT IS A CRISIS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT FACES IT WHENEVER IT HAPPENS. AND WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT'S BUILT ON MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN CENTERED AND THIS WORK WAS PUT ON HOLD WHILE EDIE WAS FOCUSED ON MEETING THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO WE HAD TO RELY ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND WE DO NOT NOW HAVE THE STRONG LEADERSHIP AT EDT. TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND DIRECTOR BE ASSIGNED AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR NASTY FARIAS ARE BOTH HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE EDT ITEMS ALSO IS DIRECT DEPOSIT I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS TO- AND HAVE URGED AND SUPPORTED- WE WANT TO MOVE AWAY FROM JUST RELY ON DEBIT CARDS. WHICH WILL ADDRESS BOTH THE NEED TO EXPEDITE PAYMENTS AND TO FIGHT FRAUD. THERE'S ALSO A LINE ITEM FOR YOU AYE NAVIGATORS AT THE AMERICAN JOB CENTERS THIS IS MAKING SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND LOOKING FOR HELP THAT THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE ON SITE WHO CAN ASSIST IN ALL THE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE STATE- WITH NAVIGATING THE U. I. SYSTEM. OF COURSE THESE PROPOSALS ARE ARE. THERE'S THINGS WE NEED RIGHT NOW THERE'S ALSO FOUNDATIONS THAT WE'RE BUILDING SO THAT HOPEFULLY SOME OF THESE NEEDS WILL LESSEN AS WE SPENT ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR SYSTEMS AND REALLY- ROOT. OF REFINED AND TRUE- THE PROCESS THAT ARE YOU. TO DELIVER I'VE BEEN. THERE IS ALSO TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT IT EDT LANGUAGE ACCESS INITIATIVE. AGAIN SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL HAVE REYES SOMETHING THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART SOMETHING WE KNOW THAT IS NEEDED. WHICH IS ENSURING THAT- OUR GOVERNMENT SERVICES ESPECIALLY AGAIN SOMETHING LIKE- LIKE EDIE AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHICH IS REALLY. HE IS MOST NEEDED IN THE IN THE WORST OF TIMES- THAT THAT IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND HAVING A MULTI LINGUAL- MULTIPLE ACCESS AND SERVICES ESSENTIAL TO THAT AND THIS ALSO INCLUDES GRANTS. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE OUR REGION EDUCATION TO THOSE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES. THIS BUILT ON THE VISION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH CBO. WHO HAVE THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO SERVE IS A REALLY KEY STRATEGY. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE EMPLOYED. WE'RE NOT. ENJOYING THE QUALITY OF JOBS. THE WAGE. HEALTH JOBS. UNION UPWARD MOBILITY AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE JOB THAT WE WANT FOR OUR CELL. FOR A LONG ONE AND FOR ALL WERE. HELLO ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF THE NATION HAS SEEN GROWTH IN BOTH HIGH WAGE AND LOW WAGE JOBS BUT A HOLLOWING OUT OF THOSE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND A DECLINING SHARE OF WORKERS WHO RECEIVE HEALTH BENEFITS RETIREMENT BENEFITS THOSE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF ECONOMIC SECURITY AND SHE MEASURES OF JOB QUALITY. AND IN ADDITION NOT ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE FULLY PARTICIPATED IN THE STATE'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND THE VIBRANT ECONOMY. SO THE MAY REVISION WHICH WE ALSO CALL THE CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN PROPOSES A NEARLY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN ECONOMIC RESILIENCE AND JOBS PACKAGE TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PANDEMIC. BUT ALSO THAT EXISTED BEFORE. IT RECOGNIZES THAT BAD JOBS LOW WAGE JOBS EXPLOITATIVE JOBS ARE AS MUCH A CHOICE AS GOOD JOBS ARE CHOICE AND WE HAVE A CHANCE NOW TO SHOW WHERE CALIFORNIA'S GONNA COME DOWN ON THAT DECISION MAKING. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY AND WE ALSO NEED TO REVERSE A DECADES LONG TRENDS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OF BOTH IN LOW WAGE WORK AND THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR. THIS BUDGET DOES MORE THAN TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES IT MAKES REAL INVESTMENTS AND HOW WE DELIVER AND YES THE REQUEST ARE BIG BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE CHALLENGES ARE HUGE. SO THE PLAN INCLUDES A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND. WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR BOTTOM UP PLANNING FOR EACH REGION OF THE STATE RECOGNIZING THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH WILL LOOK LIKE WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT JOB CREATION. BUT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRIES AND IN THE LANGUAGE OF ECONOMIST WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE FOR LABOR. THEN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN ALSO INCLUDES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET WORKERS INTO THOSE GOOD JOBS IT INCLUDES BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR WORKFORCE AGENCIES. IT'S ABOUT TRANSFORMING OUR WORDS OUR SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE TRULY PREPARING WORKERS FOR THE QUALITY JOBS AND MEETING EMPLOYER NEEDS AND COMBATING THE SYSTEMIC EXCLUSION OF THOSE WERE TOO OFTEN LEFT BEHIND EVEN IN GOOD TIMES. AND THIS IS THE SUPPLY SIDE FOR LABOR SO WE CAN'T DO JUST ONE WE KNOW THAT IF WE ARE NOT INTENTIONAL BUT JOB CREATION ABOUT PLANNING REGIONALLY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD WILL NOT LIFT WORKERS OUT OF POVERTY. AND WILL NOT MAKE REGIONAL ECONOMY STRONG. AND WE KNOW THAT IF WE ARE TRAINING WITH THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS IN MIND AND COMMITTING COMMITTING TO TRUE ACCESS FOR THOSE WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE LEFT BEHIND WE WILL REINFORCE ALL THE INEQUITIES. AND WE WILL MISS OUT ON THE TALENTS AND ABILITIES OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE PEOPLE. EACH OF THESE TWO PIECES THE- RESIDENTS FUND AND THE TRAINING. EACH OF THEM HAS TWO CATEGORIES IN THE PROPOSAL I'M JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THEM THEY'RE DIFFERENT ISSUE ITEMS BUT I WANNA. DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER BECAUSE ALL THESE FOUR PIECES REALLY COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER. SO FIRST OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDING. FOR THIS ECONOMIC IT IS CALLED THE COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND. THERE WILL BE ONE PLANNING GRANTS TO EACH OF THE STATE'S REGION'S AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER RECOGNIZING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOTH STRATEGIES WITH THE REQUIRED BOTTOM UP PLANNING BY THOSE WHO KNOW THE REGION'S BEST. AND CAN ALIGN THE REGION'S STRENGTHS AND THE NEED FOR ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO CLIMATE AND EQUITY AND ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS ALL THOSE THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN TOGETHER. AND TO MAKE THIS MORE THAN JUST WORDS AGAINST THE FUNDING BILL WILL ALLOWTHE CREATION OF HIGH ROAD TRANSITION COLLABORATIVE. WORKER VOICES ARE HEARD WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE HEARD ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE REGIONS AND THEY WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION HOW WE CREATE THE GOOD JOBS OF OUR FUTURE. WHERE WILL THE JOBS COME FROM THAT'S THE FIRST COMPLETE THE PLANNING COMPLEMENT OF THE RESILIENCE FUND THE SECOND IS IMPLEMENTATION. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO PLANNING AFTER PLANNING RIGHT WE NEED FUNDS THAT WILL ALLOW IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIC PLANS. SO THESE COLLABORATIVE WILL BRING COMMITTEES TOGETHER THROUGH INCLUSIVE PROCESS THAT INCLUDES EMPLOYERS THAT INCLUDES WORKERS THAT INCLUDES INDUSTRIES IN BOTH AREAS TO PUT AS A ROAD MAP FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. AND AND. AND THEN IT WILL ALSO PUT IMPLEMENTATION. OF THOSE PLANS THAT'S THE FIRST BIG BUCKET THE SECOND AROUND TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ALSO HAS TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST IS REALLY JUST JOB READINESS RIGHT IT'S THE WHO'S GONNA TAKE THESE JOBS AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS INCLUDED- AND ARE HYDRO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND OUR HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS THOSE H. R. T. P.'S HRC SEES. THERE WAS ORIGINALLY IN THE BUDGET A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR- REQUEST THERE'S NOW AN ADDITIONAL NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION BRINGING IT TO A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR INVESTMENTS IN THESE BOTH INDUSTRIES AND WE KNOW WHAT SOME OF THEM ARE RIGHT WE KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE HOSPITALITY TRANSPORTATION HEALTHCARE AND MORE AND WE KNOW THAT H. O. T. PCH OUR SPECIES WORK. THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FOR THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL PROVIDING TRAINING FUNDS IN HIGH DEMAND SECTORS THAT INCLUDE I. T. INCLUDE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING INCLUDE HEALTHCARE AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND THESE PLANS WILL TRAIN ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS. I JUST ON ETP SIDE- AND SO THESE ARE TRAINING FOR GOOD JOB THEY'RE ALIGNED WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET RIGHT INCLUDING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES INCLUDING HOUSING TRANSPORTATION. INCLUDING WHAT YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING DISASTER RELIEF AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AND FINALLY THE FOURTH PIECE THE OTHER BUCKET UNDER WORKFORCE IS INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE LINKS BETWEEN EDUCATION TRAINING AND INDUSTRY. PUTTING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS ON A PATH TO A NEW AND A BETTER FUTURE ONE THAT IS FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AND TO EQUITY. AND ON THAT ITEM THERE'S A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE NEW AND DEEPER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR COLLEAGUES ATTENDING COLLEGES ARE ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. BUT THESE FUNDS COMPLEMENT THE FUNDS I JUST MENTIONED TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOP ORG AND ETP. AND IT WILL ADDRESSES. LONGSTANDING CRITIQUE THE AGE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND- DO NOT CORRELATE TO CURRENT FUTURE. JOBS THE LAST THING I JUST SAY IS THAT WALL SO MUCH ABOUT THE LAST YEAR WAS NOT FORESEEN SOME OF THE THINGS ARE REFLECTED IN THIS MAYBE VISION IN THIS CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLANS ARE THE RESULT OF SEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN PLANTED. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR AS THE STATE'S CHALLENGES EVD HAS DEMONSTRATED WE CANNOT FIX THE LEAKY ROOF O THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE ARE. YOU LIVING IN STRENGTH BEFORE IT BECOMES A CRISIS AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF MY COLLEAGUES TIM RAINY UP. OF THE COMPANY WILL POST ON THE BOARD AND READ HAVE YEAR OF THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. IN THEIR BOOK HERE TO SO- ALL OF THIS IS ALSO BEING DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TAKE WARDEN SARAH WHITE AND SARAH IS ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE FUNDS BUT THESE INVESTMENTS BUILT ON THINGS WE KNOW WORKS INCLUDING BRING EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TOGETHER WITH INTERMEDIARIES WHO KNOW THE REGIONS OR THE INDUSTRIES REALLY WELL. WE'VE ALSO HAD WORKED THE GOVERNOR'S FUTURE WORK COMMISSION OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUE SENATOR HENRY STERN WHO SERVED ON THAT COMMISSION WHO CREATED RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING LET'S END POVERTY WORKING CALIFORNIA LET'S REJECT THE IDEA THAT WORKERS SHOULD BE GRATEFUL JUST TO HAVE ANY JOB BECAUSE JOB QUALITY MATTERS AND LETS THE FUTURE PROOF CALIFORNIA BY A LINE OF WORK FOR SYSTEM OUR EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. AND THESE PRINCIPLES ARE INFUSED THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT IS TUE THAT SOME OF THIS HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE BUT WE CANNOT JUST RELY ON THE OLD WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS LED BECAUSE WE ARE SMART ABOUT BUILDING ON WHAT WORKS AND ALSO UNAFRAID TO BE BOLD WHEN THE MOMENT REQUIRES IT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR CLIMATE GOALS OPPORTUNITIES NOT JUST FOR CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER BUT A CHANCE TO BREAK THE JOBS. THERE HOUSING GOALS ARE NOT JUST A WAY TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES BUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE GOOD JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST THERE ARE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES YOU HEARD ABOUT BY DOCTOR DEALER DO JESUS DIRECTOR GO DID YOU THIS MORNING BUT ALSO ABOUT CREATING GOOD JOBS IN DISASTER RELIEF. AND ALL THOSE OTHER. ICAL PRIORITIES FOR THE- AND IT CARE. ARE OUR NOT JUST A MEETING THE NEEDS FOR CHILDCARE AND THE ELDERLY BUT ALSO OF CARE WORKERS THEMSELVES. WE HAVE SEEN THAT THIS WON'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT AND IT WON'T HAPPEN UNLESS WE THINK BIG. ENGAGE INDUSTRIES AND MAKE INVESTMENTS AND THEN DO THE WORK TO DELIVER. SO I'M GONNA STOP THERE AND SEE IF. OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING TO ADD AND I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE SPECIFIC- QUESTIONS. ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUES. FROM WHAT I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU- DIRECTORS WHO ARE APPRECIATE YOU GIVING THE OVERALL- VISION OF WHERE WE'RE GOING OR WHERE WE WANT TO GO- AND I AGREE- WHOLEHEARTEDLY THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT- ARE I WANT TO RAISE IT JUST IN GENERAL TERMS BUT THEN WE CAN GET INTO IT WITH THE SPECIFIC ISSUES BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE'S ANOTHER ELEMENT- THAT GETS LOST AND I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL TO OUR SUCCESS. AND THAT IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY FOR THE USE OF ALL THESE- FUNDS AW I'M NOT AFRAID TO THINK BIG BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MAKE THESE VERY BIG- INVESTMENTS THERE WERE REALLY GOING TO GET OUT OF IT WHAT WE ENVISION AND WHAT WE WANT TO GET OUT OF IT- THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN UNLESS YOU HAVE A- SPECIFIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES SO. WITH US HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT- I APPRECIATE AGAIN- YOUR PROVIDING THAT VISION AND MAYBE WE COULD DIG INTO- THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US HERE TODAY- AND SO PLEASE STICK AROUND. I'M SURE YOU'LL BE PART OF A ANSWER IN ANY OF THE- ON COMMITTEES QUESTIONS- SENATE QUARTERS THE ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO SAY BEFORE WE JUMP INTO SPECIFICS. NO THANK YOU MEASURE I'M GOOD FOR NOW OKAY. GREAT SO- LET'S GET INTO. SENATOR NEWMAN DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BROADLY BEFORE WE GET INTO THE SPECIFIC ISSUES NO MA'AM OKAY THANK YOU GOOD OKAY I LET'S GET INTO THEN ISSUE ONE OF WHICH IS THE DEFERRED IN PERSPECTIVE WORKLOADS AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION OF RESOURCES DOES ANYBODY WANT TO. EXPLAIN THAT. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WHO ARE YOU I AM JAILED FOR ALL THE FISCAL OFFICER FOR THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OKAY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR BUDGET REQUESTS- SO AS SECRETARY SU TOUCHED UPON THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THIS ISSUE IS A TO R. SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND REQUEST. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ADDRESS WORKLOADS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INITIAL PANDEMIC CLAIMS SURGEON ADDITION TO SUSTAINING CURRENT WORKLOAD DEMANDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS ISSUE RELATES TO EDIE'S ABLE REVISED SUBMISSION FOR THE U. I. PROGRAM WHICH REDUCES FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE U. I. PROGRAM BY ABOUT SEVENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY TWO POSITIONS TO ALIGN WITH THE ESTIMATED FEDERAL RESOURCES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THESE REQUESTS AND I ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM HEAT ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY OBVIOUSLY THE EDT AND GETTING OUR BENEFITS OUT IS BEEN ON EVERYBODY'S MINDS- SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. GO WAY THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS OVERNIGHT- CAUSED. ENORMOUS DISTRESS AND HARDSHIP- CAN YOU JUST- UP- I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD BE FROM ADD JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE BY THESE ABOUT THESE. A DEFERRED WORKLOADS AND- WHAT WOULD YOU MEAN BY BY THAT DATE DEFERRED IN PERSPECTIVE WORKLOADS. THANK YOU CAROL WILLIAMS- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS REQUEST SO IT'S CALEB MENTIONED AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC THE SIGNIFICANT WORKLOADS PRIMARILY ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS WERE DEFERRED TO MEET THE UNDERLYING MISSION OF PAYING YOU NOT YOU KNOW PUT THEM. ON A PLANE INSURANCE BENEFITS- DURING THAT PASSED THIS PAST YEAR- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR QUITE HONESTLY AND LATE DECEMBER EARLY JANUARY AND THEY MANDATED THAT THESE WORKLOADS. RESULT WE HAVE PROPOSED ENTERING A CONTRACT TO FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THESE WORKLOADS BECAUSE THEY ARE DAUNTING AND I THINK YOU HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU BUT IF I COULD JUST SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE'S JUST ASK WHAT ARE THESE WORKLOADS THE PROSPECTIVE WORK THAT CALEB MENTIONED AS YOU ALL KNOW WE DO HAVE A BACKLOG TODAY. SO IT WOULD. IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE IN OUR MINDS TO NOT ASK FOR ASSISTANCE TO DO THE WORK BEHIND US IF WE'RE NOT CURRENT TODAY WHICH WERE NOT SO. THIS REQUESTED DOES FACTOR IN THE DELTA DIFFERENCE OF THE BACKLOG THAT CONTINUES TO OCCUR. TODAY THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY PROSPECTIVE AND RETROACTIVE BUT THE BULK OF THE WORK HAS TO DO WITH DETERMINATIONS THAT WE NEED TO CONDUCT DETERMINE ONE'S ELIGIBILITY. THERE ARE VENDORS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN ASSISTING OTHER STATES AND WE THINK THE COMPLEMENT OF EDT CONTINUING OUR ROBUST. MERIT STATE STAFF HIRING THAT WE'RE DOING TODAY WE ARE HIGH AND WE CONTINUE TO HIRE EVERY SINGLE MONTH COUPLED WITH OUTSIDE VENDORS SYSTEMS WILL ALLOW US. TO RECTIFY THIS WORKLOAD WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS SO I'LL STOP THERE AND ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OKAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BACK LOG- IS IT OF- THE NUMBER THAT OF CASES THEY JUST EXIST AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THEM AND THEY GO YOU KNOW THEY DECREASE AND DECREASE OR IS IT A LOOK AT CHANGING NUMBER OF CASES- HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WELL AS- WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS TODAY'S BACKLOG HAS TO DO WITH PRIMARILY THE END OF- A CLAIM IT'S BENEFIT YEAR WE'RE CLAIMS AND AFTER TWELVE MONTHS AND GENERALLY CLAIMANTS ARE ASKED TO OR IF THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THEY HAVE TO REAPPLY FOR NEW CLIENTS WE ARE WORKING ON A PROCESS RIGHT NOW WE HOPE TO HAVE IT IMPLEMENTED- IN VERY SHORT. WELL IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS SO THAT A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF CLAIMANTS DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE TO REAPPLY WE CAN LOOK AT THEIR INFORMATION WE CAN LOOK TO SEE IF ANY WAGES- HAVE INCURRED OR OCCURRED IN THE PAST QUARTER AND IF NOT WE WILL MOVE THEM FORWARD IF THEY CONTINUE TO CERTIFY AUTOMATICALLY IN IS TO CONTINUE BENEFIT PAYMENTS SO BUT THIS IS THE BULK OF THE WORK THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPRESS AS A BACKLOG IN THE BACKLOG AGAIN IT'S REFLECTED ON OUR DASHBOARD IT'S OVER TWENTY ONE DAYS IT IS THE WORK ET DE NEEDS. TO DO AND IT IS IT IS GROWING. SO THAT'S THE WORK AHEAD SO THE REQUEST IS TO DEAL WITH. THE SLIPPAGE IN THE CURRENT WORK AS WELL AS ALL OF THE WORK BEHIND US THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT SENATOR NEWMAN. I'VE MISSED WHIMS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I QUESTION FOR YOU WITH RESPECT TO THE BACKLOG- IS. THE WORK BEING DONE IS THAT TO SATISFY THE. HI IF YOU CAN HEAR WE HAVE LOST AUDIO FOR THE ROOM YEAH WE'VE WAITED TO AND I'M SURE THE SUSPENSE WAS JUST KILLING YOU. AB SO THEY THE BAD LUCK AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH IT IS ARE THERE ANY OTHER CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT BEING PAID OR IS IT SIMPLY MAKING SURE THAT YOU MEET ALL THE STATURE REQUIREMENTS. AROUND YOU KNOW ALL THE REPORTING PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH CLAIMS THAT THAT IS A GREAT THAT IS THE QUESTION THE DETERMINATION INTERVIEW THE DETERMINATION WORKLOAD AS IT EXISTS TODAY GOING FORWARD AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT'S BEHIND US. CURRENTLY DOES NOT ALLOW CLAIMANTS TO BE PAID SO BEHIND US THEY WERE ALL PAID SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE RETRO ACT. RETROACTIVE WORKLOAD TO SEE IF THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID. PRESENTLY ONCE WE RESUMED THE DETERMINATIONS WHICH WE RESUMED IN JANUARY WE ARE COULDN'T- CLAIMS ARE NOT BEING PAID. IF I DETERMINATION INTERVIEW NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED. SO FORWARD. CLAIMANTS ARE NOT BEING PAID WE ARE LOOKING AT OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE BUT TODAY. IF THEY'RE ABOUT. SOMETHING OCCURS WITHIN THE CLAIM WHEN THEY'RE CERTIFYING HOW THEY'RE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. AND IT'S IT THAT. CAUSES EDT STAFF PERSON TO HAVE TO REVIEW THAT- QUICKLY CALL THE CLAIM OF COURSE SCHEDULE OF FULL DETERMINATION INTERVIEW WHILE ALL OF THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED OR THE CLAIMANT IS WAITING FOR US TO CONTACT THEM. THEY'RE NOT PRESENTLY BEING PAID- THAT'S WITH THE SUIT THANK YOU SO WITH RESPECT TO ENTER YOU TOUCH ON WHICH IS WHICH IS THE- A RE APPLICATION. A RECONFIRMATION PLANS UP HOW BIG IS HOW BIG IS THAT NUMBER RIGHT IT IS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CLAIMS IT'S NOT A HUNDRED BUT I'M SURE IT'S- NOT A SMALL NUMBER EITHER OF CLAIMS THAT NEED TO BE RENEWED FOR THE FOR THE- AFTER A YEAR OF BENEFITS. AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU ACTUALLY WHAT'S THE TIME FRAME RIGHT NOW BETWEEN A BENEFITS ENDING AND THEN RE YOU KNOW RE RE CONFIRMING ELIGIBILITY TO BEGIN PAYING TO GET IN THE SECOND YEAR. IT'S HUGE. IT IS HUGE IT IS UPWARDS OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMANTS AND IT IS OUR NUMBER ONE- WORK EFFORT TODAY. THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND ANY SUBJECT MATTER STAFF OR HAVE BEEN HITS DOWN ALL WEEK BECAUSE THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE. ONE WE CAN MOVE THEM FORWARD- WITHOUT HAVING TO FILE A CLAIM- BUT IS ALSO THE WORK EFFORT THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK WHEN WE NOTIFIED ALL CLAIMANTS BY TEXT OR EMAIL. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO FILE A CLAIM. BECAUSE MANY HAVE BEEN SITTING IN QUEUE YOU'VE HEARD THIS PENDING STATUS YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM YOUR STAFF YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM US. ON KNOWING IF THEY'RE NOT GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE INFORMATION ON THERE YOU ARE ONLINE ACCOUNT THEY WERE UNKNOWINGLY NOT- FILING FOR NEW CLAIM WHEN IN FACT THEY THEY NEED TO SOLICIT TEXT MESSAGES OUT TO ALL OF THEM NO BUT WE'RE GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF WE CAN MOVE THEM FORWARD WITHOUT HAVING TO FILE A CLAIM THEY DON'T NEED TO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT EFFORT ON AND REDUCE THAT VOLUME OF- INDIVIDUALS. WHOSE CLAIMS CLAIM YOUR HAS COME AN EXPIRED AND NOW THEY'RE IN THE PENDING STATUS AND UNDER. UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS. I ASSUME MOST CLAIMANTS ARE STILL ELIGIBLE AFTER THEY THEY THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THAT RE APPLICATIONS THAT. IS THAT GENERALLY TRUE I WOULD SAY THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF IT'S JUST A BEARD YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THE BROCCOLI THIS NURSERY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. GREAT THANK YOU- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE- APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY WORKERS ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED OR- TO DO THIS WORK- CABLE IF YOU CAN CONVERT FROM ME I'M AWARE THAT WE CONVERTED AND THE REQUEST IS IN HOURS WORTH OF WORK. BECAUSE WE WERE LOOK THINKING TO LEAVE IT TO THE VENDOR TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT THEY NEED TO BRING ON AND SUPPORT AND- BUT I COULD JUST TAKE THE LIBERTY TO SAY IN OUR THOUGHT PROCESS REGARDING- CLEARLY STATE STAFF AUGMENTATION AND OR OR VENDOR WORK- YOU SEE THAT OUR PROPOSAL IS FOR A VENDOR ASSISTANCE WHILE WE DO CONTINUE TO HIRE AND BEHIND THE VALUE STATE STAFF. BECAUSE IT IN OUR OUR DETERMINATION WILL BE FASTER. FASTER IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND FASTER IN TERMS OF- SOON AS THEY'RE TRAINED THEY'RE ON THE FLOOR WORKING. AND THERE'S WITH STATES OUT THERE HAS TO BE A RAMP UP IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE- THE LEADS AND THE MANAGERS THAT HAVE TO BE HIRED- ALONGSIDE THAT THE STATE STAFF SO I'M SORRY IF I DEVIATED FROM THE QUESTION- MY APOLOGIES IF YOU COULD ASK IT AGAIN. WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CORE OF WHAT I WAS LEADING UP TO OKAY YES I THINK THERE'S OR R. THERE IS A REAL ISSUE FOR ME- THAT IF WE'RE GONNA AUG. A CONTRACT OUT WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS YEAH ARE WE GOING TO CONTRACT OUT WHAT IS. OF THE POTENTIAL OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. TO DO THIS WORK AND WHY DOES WHY DO WE HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH THE VENDOR. TO DO- TO HIRE PEOPLE OUT VERSES YOU CAN GET A VENDOR TO. DO THE TRAINING YOU CAN GET A VENDOR TO DO THE RECRUITMENT I MEAN I I'M NOT SURE BUT- CLEARLY THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THE REPRESENTATION. THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE SO I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. A VENDOR THAT WILL BRING AND CONTRACTED OUT WORKERS INSTEAD OF HIRING- STATE STAFF. FULLY UNDERSTAND YOU'RE IN YOU'RE pI JUST REALLY WANTED TO IMPRESS THE PARALLEL TRACK THAT WE- ABSOLUTELY REQUIREMENTS ABSOLUTELY INTEND TO CONTINUE WITH OUR STATE STAFF HIRING WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF OUR MOST RECENT GOALS. IN HIRING- CASE IN POINT IN APRIL SIX WE HAD PLANNED TO HIRE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX STAFF THEY WERE AT THE- OFFICE TECHNICIAN LEVEL. WE FOUND TWENTY EIGHT. NOT A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT APRIL FIFTEENTH WE WERE TARGETED TO HIRE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE OF OUR MOST ADVANCED CLASSIFICATION THAT'S OUR UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVE OUR TARGET WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE WE HAVE ROBUST RECRUITMENT GOING ON WE HIRED NINETY SEVEN. TO DATE THERE'S ONLY EIGHTY SIX THAT REMAIN IN THAT CLASS SO YES ALL EFFORTS WILL CONTINUE WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET UP BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT WE ARE FALLING SHORT OF ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO HIRE THE SO THIS WILL CONTINUE IN PARALLEL WITH THE VENDORS AND YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE INVOLVED WITH- NATIONAL WELL THE STATE'S COME TOGETHER WITH THE SIMILAR ISSUES. THERE ARE VENDORS THAT. ARE KNOWN OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE SPECIALIZED IN YOUR LINE. IN THE OTHER STATES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN ABLE TO BRING THEM FORWARD PARALLEL WITH THEIR STATE SAFF TO KNOCK DOWN DID THIS BACKLOG WORK BUT I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND THEY'RE WELL TAKEN. OKAY WELL I'M JUST NO I'M- HIGHLY RESPECT THE FACT ALL THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING- I REALLY DO I THINK THIS HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS CHALLENGE ONLY USE OF TERM UNPRECEDENTED IT'S BEYOND UNPRECEDENTED- BUT I'M- I WOULD NOT SUPPORT GETTING A CONTRACTOR I'M NOT TAKE CONTRACTED TO DO OUGHT TO BE THE ACTUAL EMPLOYER OF THESE I THINK YOU CAN GET AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR TO HELP RECRUIT. IF THEY HAVE THAT SPECIALTY THEY SHOULD HELP RECRUIT THEY COULD HELP TRAIN BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF BEING EMPLOYEES THEY SHOULD BE STATE EMPLOYEES- OKAY. SENATORS ANY OTHER- QUESTIONS ON ISSUE ONE. RUN ISSUE ONE NO. THANK YOU MISS WILLIAMS- WITH IS THAT. THAT IT HERE OKAY THANK YOU MS WILLIAMS ON THIS ONE ISSUES HERE FOR MOVING ON NOW TO ISSUE TO WHICH IS THE U. I. LOAN INTEREST PAYMENT. WHO WILL TAKE THAT ON. YES MADAM CHAIR- THIS IS CAPABLE AGAIN WITH EDT CAME. COMPONENTS TO THIS ISSUE- THE FIRST OF WHICH I'LL TOUCH UPON- THE GOVERNOR'S MAYOR VISION INCLUDES AN UPDATE TO THE LOAN INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE FEDERAL LOAN THAT WAS SECURED BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PAYING YOUR BENEFITS- THE AMOUNT WAS DECREASED FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATE OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. DOWN TO NOW ABOUT THIRTY FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION- THAT PAYMENT DOES COME DUE IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR- THE REASON FOR THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IS PRIMARILY DUE TO FURTHER INTEREST RELIEF PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT THE STATE NOW REALLY ONLY DOES INTEREST FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DAYS- AS OPPOSED TO THE PRIOR ESTIMATE WHICH IS REALLY BASED ON ABOUT NINE MONTHS. ACCRUED INTEREST IN ADDITION TO THAT MUCH- BETTER- ECONOMIC CONDITION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN I'M COMPARED TO WHERE WE ARE AT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- SO THAT'S THE FIRST COMPONENT IS THE REDUCED INTEREST PAYMENT ON THE SECOND COMPONENT- I'LL ACTUALLY DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON THE PROPOSAL INCLUDED. IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE- WHICH WAS LEVERAGING A PORTION OF OUR BUT FUNDING TO PAY DOWN SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING- FEDERAL YOU AYE FINANCE. THANK YOU AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND US SENATORS DANIELLE BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FOR THIS THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ABOUT ONE BILLION AND FEDERAL RECOVERY FUNDS TO IMPROVE THE BALANCE OF THE STATE'S YOU I FIND THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS THE BALANCE OF THE ADMINISTRATION SPENDING THEY ARE PLAN BASED ON MINISTRATION PRIORITIES FOR COVERT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AND THAT THE AMOUNT RECEIVED THIS COMMITMENT BALANCES THE HISTORICAL INVESTMENT THIS MAY REVISION PROPOSES AS WELL AS THE NEED TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE U. I. LOAN. I'M AND I. pKNOW YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED THANK YOU WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE BALLOT SHOULD THE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS A COMING OF THE GREAT RECESSION WE CARRY A BALANCE ABOUT I GUESS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAVE COMING OUT NOW- AND THEN THERE WAS FINALLY FULLY REPAID- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE CALIFORNIA. ASSUMING THAT THE YOU KNOW THE LOAN BALANCE IS PROJECTED A TWENTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION HOW LONG AND HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO GET BACK DOWN TO ZERO AGAIN. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE AND- WHAT WILL IT TAKE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SENATOR- THIS IS CALEB MORAL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ALL THE DEPARTMENT I'M SO AS AS YOU MENTIONED- YES THE OUTSTANDING ADVANCE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WAS ABOUT HALF OF WHAT IT CURRENTLY IS NOW CURRENTLY ARE OUTSTANDING ADVANCE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ABOUT TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION- THAT IS ANTICIPATED GROW BY THE END OF THIS YEAR TO ABOUT TWENTY FOUR AND ACTUALLY PROJECTED TO FURTHER GROW TO ABOUT TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY SEVEN. BY THE NEXT YEAR- ABSENT ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE IN YOU WHY IT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY TAKE THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE IF NOT LONGER TO PAY THAT OFF REALLY THE ONLY EXISTING MECHANISM TO PAY DOWN- THE OUTSTANDING FEDERAL LOAN IS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE AND WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. IS THROUGH- FOOD CREDIT REDUCTIONS SO THE FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX- STATES THAT HAVE OUTSTANDING ADVANCES FOR- A TO WITH THAT AT YEAR TWO AND BEYOND- EMPLOYERS HAVE TO START PAYING IN IN A HIGHER INCREASE FEDERAL TAX AND THAT GOES TO PAY DOWN THE OUTSTANDING ADVANCE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AS WE CURRENTLY PROJECT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA OBVIOUSLY START HAPPENING. AND THAT WILL START TO PAY DOWN THAT LOAN ADVANCE BUT IT TAKES A WHILE BEFORE IT STARTS TO REALLY PICK UP AND PAY DOWN THE LOAN ADVANCE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A POINT 3% INCREASE EVERY YEAR THAT EMPLOYERS. PAY AN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL TAXES. AND CHAU AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD IT IN THIS COMMITTED BEFORE- THERE'S REAL APPREHENSION ON THE PART OF EMPLOYERS IS TO- YOU KNOW WHAT THE BURDEN MAY BE WHEN THAT TIME COMES SO WHAT'S THE THINKING. OR THE PROCESS FOR- LETTING THEM KNOW IS BORN VANCE'S POSSIBLE OR- I GUESS PROSPECTIVELY SOFTENING THE BLOW IN SOMEWHERE AND IT IS SUPPOSED TO LIKE ONE ASSESSMENT TO BEGIN THE YEAR WHICH IS. AS I UNDERSTAND HOW IT TYPICALLY HAPPENS. YEAH WELL AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER- SO THAT THE FOOD TAX WHICH AGAIN THAT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE IRS THAT'S NOT ADMINISTERED BY- THAT BECOMES DOING PAYABLE JANUARY JANUARY FEBRUARY REACH YEAR I BELIEVE- THERE ARE NOTIFICATIONS TO EMPLOYERS THAT GET PUT OUT BY THE IRS. AND I ALSO BELIEVE HE PUTS ON OUR WEBSITE- LINKS TO THE IRS- WEB PAGES AND NOTIFICATIONS AROUND. FOOD- SO EMPLOYERS ARE AWARE- THEY THEY NORMALLY HAVE TO REPORT THEIR FOOD A LIABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TIME WHEN A STATE IS WHAT'S CONSIDERED A CREDIT REDUCTION STATE WHERE THEY HAVE TO START PAYING THAT POINT 3% ANNUALLY- THERE'S A SEPARATE FORM THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO FILE WITH THE IRS. SO THEY'RE NOTIFIED THAT THE STATE THEY'RE IN HAS A HIGHER FEDERAL TAX RATE AND THEY THEN HAVE TO PAY THAT LIKE YOU SAID IN JANUARY FEBRUARY EACH YEAR- THE FIRST YEAR. THEN EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER FOOD TAX WOULD BE FOR TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH BECOMES DOING PAYABLE IN JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AB PREACHER THAT SO WITH THE EXTRA. BE AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL- THAT THE BUSINESSES WILL HAVE RECOVERED SAYS THAT THIS ISN'T. A REALLY ONEROUS- DOESN'T REALLY OWNERS IMPACT ON BUSINESSES THAT ARE PROBABLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AS THEY WORK THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS RECESSION. THANK YOU SIR FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT OBVIOUSLY AS YOU STATED- I'M NOT SURE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DO- ALL I KNOW IS THAT'S THE CURRENT MECHANISM. THAT EXISTS AND IS IN IN FEDERAL LAW THAT THAT WOULD TRIGGER- CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA HAS AN OUTSTANDING ADVANCE. YEAH IT JUST IT IT STARTS TO FEEL YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE INSULT INJURY AT SOME POINT WITH. THE SAME BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW SO DEVASTATED IN A RECESSION- IT WILL BE THEN HAS TO PAY ANOTHER BILL- AS AS WE ARE. JUST GETTING OUT OF IT. SO YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING WE PROBABLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IS THE LEGISLATURE- FOR THE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT WELL WE'RE GONNA. UP A COMMENT FROM MR ALAMO AND THEN GO TO SENATOR CORTEZ HE- SAID OKAY SENATOR. YES YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU GO AHEAD. REALLY SENATOR HER JUMPING AND- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS CHAZ ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GOING TO SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT- DVDS PROPOSAL HERE RELATED TO THE U. Y. INTEREST PAYMENT AS WELL AS THE LARGER A. R. P. FUNDS- ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT- BUT JUST A COUPLE SORT OF POINTS FOR CONTEXT OUT REGARDING THE DEPOSIT ITSELF.I'M REITERATE THE PROPOSED TO DEPOSIT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDS. THROUGH THAT EARLY PREPAYMENT IF YOU WILL ON ON THE STATE'S OUTSTANDING. FEDERAL YOU AYE LOANS- THAT DEPOSIT RESPONSE TO ABOUT 5% OF THE LOANS WE'VE TAKEN TODAY. AND THINKING ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF HOW THE DEPOSIT WOULD AFFECT EITHER THE STATE OR EMPLOYERS WITH- THE- EMPLOYER- PAYROLL TAX REPAYMENT PLAN THAT THAT MR CORAL JUST WALKED THROUGH- IF WE PLACE THE DEPOSIT NOW IS PART OF THE MANY REVISION. IN A FACT THAT WILL REDUCE HIGHER EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. IN OF THE ROAD PERIOD- SO IN THE CASE OF. WHAT STATES ARE TENURE FOR. TO FULLY REPAY THE FEDERAL LOANS- THAT WOULD BE MAY BE REDUCED TO NINE YEARS OR BY THE EVIL AND ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND I BRING UP THIS POINT. ONLY TO CLARIFY THAT THE DEPOSIT WOULDN'T HAVE A AN IMMEDIATE FISCAL RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS- HERE AS WE'RE WERE CONTINUING TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. THE DEPOSIT WOULD- HOWEVER SLIGHTLY REDUCE THE STATE'S INTEREST PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD AS MR HOLDEN CHEN THIS YEAR'S INTEREST PAYMENT IN HIS ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THE WAIVERS THAT. WERE GRANTED THROUGH VARIOUS PIECES OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION- THAT SUBSEQUENT YEARS INTEREST PAYMENTS COULD BE AS LARGE AS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- AND THIS. THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT WILL REDUCE THOSE SOMEWHAT GOING FORWARD OVER THE LIFE OF A ALONG THANK YOU. AND JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UPS RIGHT I DO IT WITH RESPECT TO THE INTEREST RATE IS THAT. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE RATE OF INFLATION OR MIGHT THAT CHANGE. IF INFLATION WERE TO RISE. VETERANS CHANGE ON. THIS IS- WELL WE'LL OCCURRING. AFTER SEPTEMBER ONE WAIVER ENDS- AT- FEDERAL INTEREST RATE OF TWO POINT 3% SO IT'S YOU KNOW. HISTORICALLY LOW- IT MAKES BORROWING TERMS MUCH MORE FAVORABLE TO THE STATE RIGHT NOW- BUT THOSE RATESARE TIED TO- LOOSELY TIED TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. AND THEREFORE IF OVERALL INTEREST RATES WERE TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS- THE STATE'S INTEREST PAYMENTS AS A RESULT- COULD COULD INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY ANNA. YEAH ALL THE SUDDEN THE FAVORABILITY. OF THIS ONE STRUCTURE LOOKS A LOT DIFFERENT. THAT'S YOUR HAZARD ANYTHING- TO MAKING A LARGE CONTRIBUTION NOW OUT OF- THE PRESENT SURPLUS. I WOULD DEFERRED THE QUESTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION- OBVIOUSLY THE REVISION PROPOSAL IS MORE THAN ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT- IT ALSO I SHOULD ADD INCLUDES A- STIPULATION THAT ANY LEFTOVER RESIDUAL A. R. P. ACT. OF FUNDS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WOULD BE USED THE SAME PURPOSE WE HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF ONES WERE DESPERATELY DO HOW ARE STILL BE- BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS TIME- HOW HOW TO USE THESE THESE. EXTRAORDINARY FEDERAL RESOURCES. PROJECT THANK YOU THE MANAGER SENATOR KERR IN. YEAH I THINK IT ACTUALLY IN THE LOCAL AND DIRECT THIS QUESTION TO MR ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IT'S THAT KIND OF AN ANALYSIS SO- THAT WOULD. BE REQUIRED- WOOD STRIKING TO ME ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT BESIDES JUST THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEBT- IS THE USE OF GENERAL FUND MONEY- REALLY TO TRY TO TAKE DOWN SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S OVER ON THE ASSET LIABILITY COLUMN YOU KNOW THE STATE'S BOOKS WHICH- YOU KNOW BOTH IN MY PRIVATE SECTOR LIFE- HISTORICALLY ANY MY PUBLIC SECTOR LIKE I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO A BOY- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE. GENERAL FUND AS WE ALL KNOW IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- THE ONGOING PROGRAM SAID TO YOU KNOW KEEPING THE DOORS OPEN- KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON- YOU KNOW TO PUT IT MILDLY RIGHT WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ONGOING MONEY UP ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW BY TALKING EIGHT CD FOR EXAMPLE THAT. WE KNOW IDENTIFIED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PIECES OF PROPERTY ON THE BOOKS. ACCESS LANDS IN THE STATE THAT AT SOME POINT WILL BE LIQUIDATED IT WOULD TURN INTO ONE TIME. ONE ON THE REVENUES- THOSE THOSE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS JUST LIKE THIS ALTERNATELY IS UNDER WRITTEN AS A AS A DECK TO THE STATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE STATE FUNDED MELLEY. AT THE END OF THE DAY IS GUARANTEEING- WHAT'S- WILL MAKE MORE SENSE AT SOME POINT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY IN THIS KIND OF GOES BACK TO. SURNAMES QUESTION TO- YOU KNOW AMORTIZE. THIS OUT IS AGGRESSIVELY AS POSSIBLE WITH WITH ONE TIME FUNDS SO THAT. WOULD WORK WE'RE KEEPING OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AWAY FROM OUR GENERAL FUND- GRANTED THINGS LIKE. REAL ESTATE ASSETS OR COULD BE VIEWED AS APPLES TO ORANGES YOU KNOW RELATIVE TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS- WHICH IS HISTORICALLY BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BUSINESS CONTRIBUTIONS AND SO FORTH. BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW- HAVING COME HERE RECENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT I CALL ON MY COLLEAGUES- WITH THINGS LIKE OPEB AND PENSION LIABILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND DEBT. NO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SOONER OR LATER SOME OF THEM FIGURED OUT TO DO THE SAME THING LOOK THIS IS NOW DEAD ON OUR BOOKS YOU KNOW BASED ON GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IT'S ON THE BALLOT SHEET IT'S NOT OVER ON THE GENERAL FUND SIDE. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP PAYING THIS OFF THE GENERAL FUND STE- IN. BUT WHAT WE CAN AFFORD TO DO IS PRE COMMIT- THE LIQUIDATION OF OTHER ASSETS- TO- FIRST CALL YOU KNOW TO THIS DAY THAT IT DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL IN THIS CONTEXT WERE IN MIGHT. BE SWINGING AND MISSING ON ON. ON SOMETHING THAT'S AN UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE HERE. SEVEN ARE. I WOULDN'T SAY SWINGING AND MISSING NOW- I THINK HISTORICALLY MAYBE FOR CONTACTS IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL- FEDERAL LAW SORT OF. PROVIDES AS THE DEFAULT MECHANISM FOR REPAYMENT OF LOANS THE TAX CREDIT REDUCTION. SYSTEM IF YOU'RE WELCOME MISTER WORLD MENTIONED. MOST STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA THE GREAT RECESSION HAVE AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT SYSTEM AT THE TIME THAT THE INTEREST RATES WERE FAVORABLE- AND THE OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNTS WERE AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE STATE'S MANAGEABLE FEDERAL LAW ALSO ALLOWS STATES TO ESSENTIALLY REFINANCE THIS DEBT AND PRIVATE EQUITY MARKETS- IN SEVERAL STATES TOOK THAT OPTION DURING THE GREAT RECESSION I CAN'T SPEAK TO THEIR MOTIVATIONS ON OR THE FISCAL DYNAMICS IN THOSE STATES. IS AN OPTION HERE FOR THIS FOR THE STATE TO CONSIDER- OUR OFFICE HASN'T LOOKED INTO THIS SPECIFIC OPTIONS AS YOU MENTIONED ABOUT YOUR FIRST CALL ON ON MAYBE ACCESS PROPERTIES OR OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE OTHER STATES KEPT THE NEXUS CLOSER TO BUSINESS PAYROLL TAXES- SO KEPT A LITTLE TIGHTER WITH THE EXISTING YOU I SYSTEM I'M GONNA SOMETHING WE'D BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IN MORE DETAIL- AND GET BACK.

ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YES IT DOES OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS WILLIAMS PREFIX. THAT- THANK GOD THIS IS A IT WILL BE HELD OPEN. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WERE MOVE ON NOW TO. ISSUE FIVE. AND THESE ARE VARIOUS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- PROGRAMS- WHO'S GOING TO MAKE THAT PRESENTATION. NOBODY WANTS TO DO THIS SORRY MADAM CHAIR I TO RAINY CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD I WAS FUMBLING AROUND WITH MY LAPTOP I JUST GOT A MESSAGE IT SAID. IN ONE HOUR IT'S GOING TO SHUT DOWN OR RESTART- BUT I THINK I'LL BE OKAY KIND OF FREAKED ME OUT- THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M HONORED TO BE HERE I THOUGHT I WOULD QUICKLY RUN THROUGH- THE HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS- INCREASES IN. INVESTMENTS AND THEN MAKE IT JUST KIND OF BROADLY AND GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAIL- AND THEN TRY TO PASS THE BALL. OFF TO MY COLLEAGUE RICHARD YEAR ANY T. P. AND CHENEY WEBER. AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND I WANT TO SAY. AT THE OUTSET I THINK SECRETARY TO- AND WAS REAL SLAM DUNK IN THE OVERVIEW SO I'M GONNA. TRY TO PICK UP ON THE THEME. THERE WHICH- I HOPE I CAN I CAN DO HER JUSTICE. SO JUST AT IT IN TERMS OF KIND OF CARRYING OVERVIEW PART HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS. I IT'S KIND OF A TERM OF ART. WE HAVE TWENTY TWO HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS. AROUND THE STATE DIVERSE SECTORS CURRENTLY- THERE IN INDUSTRY THEY'RE ALL INDUSTRY BASED. COLLABORATIONS MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS ORGANIZED LABOR. COLLEGES WORKFORCE BOARDS COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND ALL FOCUS ON. WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OR GROUPS. OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED DISCONNECTED YOUTH. WOMEN VETERANS LOW INCOME. UNEMPLOYED UNDER EMPLOYED- AND DEAN. WHAT WE DO WITH HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AS WE START. WITH THE BEST JOBS. IN INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE DRIVING EMPLOYMENT- AND WE ORGANIZED TYRONE EMPLOYERS INSIDE THE SECTORS AS THOSE THAT ARE OFFERING REALLY GOOD QUALITY JOBS. AND WE LINE UP WORKFORCE PROGRAMS INCREASE PATHWAYS TO THOSE JOBS AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS WITH HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS- WHAT WE DO. INSTEAD OF PUSHING PEOPLE INTO LABOR MARKETS AND HOPE THEY CONNECTED JOBS RELYING ON MARKETS- WE- WE SET UP THE CONDITIONS INSIDE THE SECTORS WITH EMPLOYERS IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS. THE POLL PEOPLE INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS. SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS APPROACH- AND KIND OF THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE APPROACH. WHICH PRESENT OBAMA. LIKE TO CALL. TRAINING PRAY- WHAT WE'RE TURNING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ON ITS HEAD. BUT BUILDING ON EXISTING CAPACITY IN EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS. AROUND THE STATE- BY THREE FOLK ON THE A SECTOR SIDE. IN COMBINING IN JOB WHILE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS INEXTRICABLY YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE. WITHOUT THE OTHER- THE HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS IS SIMILAR IN THAT IT FOCUSES ON EQUITY AND JOB QUALITY- BUT IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR SO WE HAVE ELEVEN HIERO CONSTRUCTION CAREERS PARTNERSHIPS. IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE THESE ARE REGIONAL- THEY INCLUDE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS- TRADES UNIONS IN THEIR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS- COMMITTEE COLLEGES COMMITTEE BASE ORGANIZATIONS WORKFORCE BOARDS- AND THEY CREATE. PATHWAYS TO STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP USING WHAT WE CALL THE MULTI CRAFT- APPROACH DESIGNED BY THE NATIONAL BUILDING TRADES- AND NOW IF I JUST REALLY REALLY QUICKLY. IF IT'S OKAY. MADAM CHAIR TO RUN THROUGH THE DIFFERENT WORKFORCE COMPONENTS VERY VERY QUICKLY YES. SO AS SIGNATURE SHE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HIGHER CONSTRUCTION CAREERS- THE IN A COMEBACK PLAN THIS IS ADDING A NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS ALREADY APPROVED- THIS WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TARGET INDUSTRY SECTORS. FROM FIVE TO TEN. INCLUDING MANUFACTURING ENERGY AND UTILITIES- AND AS REQUESTED BY YOU CENTER DRAWS ON OUR LAST CONVERSATION- IT AT THE LAST HEARING. WE ADDED HOSPITALITY AND PROPERTY SERVICES WHICH WERE HIT EARLY AND HARDEST- BY THE ECONOMIC SHOCK OF CODED. THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR ESPECIALLY IN LARGE CONVENTION MARKETS LIKE LOS ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA IS REALLY AN ECONOMIC DRIVER AND IT EMPLOYS PREDOMINANTLY IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN. GROUPS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CODE SO WE ADDED- THAT SECTOR AND PROPERTY SERVICES WHICH IS SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THAT. THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE WORKERS IN THAT SECTOR WE ADDED THOSE TO THAT TO THE LIST OF TARGET SECTORS. OF THE SECOND PIECE IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HIRING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO A NUMBER OF OUR CURRENT HR TEEPEES IN HRC'S HE'S ALREADY INCLUDE COLLEGES AS PARTNERS- THIS WILL WORK WILL STRENGTHEN THE COLLEGES ROLES IN THOSE EXISTING PROJECTS- AND IT'LL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES. ARE INVOLVED IN NEW PROJECTS- AND ALSO BRING COLLEGES AND MORE COLLEGES INTO THE EXISTING PROJECTS AND FOR THIS IS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE STUDENTS IN THE PARTICIPANTS. WERE PART OF H. R. T. P.'S NHRC SEIZED UP BECAUSE WE'RE LEVERAGING THAT CAPACITY OF THE COLLEGES FOR LONGER TERM EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES WERE BRINGING IN- INTEGRATING COLLEGE CREDIT- CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING. INDUSTRY VALUED CREDENTIALS THAT WE CAN AWARD OUT TO THIS PARTICIPANTS INSTANCE THAT ARE PORTABLE- AND CONTEXTUALIZE BASIC SKILLS ESL- AND MATH AS YOU WELL KNOW ITS- IT REQUIRES COLLEGE LEVEL MATH OFTEN TO GET INTO. STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- SO WE NEED TO HAVE THESE BASIC SKILLS AVAILABLE- AT COLLEGE OF MASS IS NOT A BASIC SKILL- BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE AVAILABLE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND COLLEGES ARE PERFECTLY SITUATED TO PROVIDE THOSE- SO GONNA DO WORKING ON THE- THAT ALIGNMENT THE THIRD PIECE IS. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR REGIONAL EQUITY AND RECOVERY PARTNERSHIPS. AND THIS IS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO REGIONALLY ORGANIZED LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS WE'VE DONE THIS FOR SOMETIME NOW AROUND WILL BE CALLED REGIONAL PLANNING UNITS THAT WE IDENTIFIED. IN THE STATE. IN WITH REGIONAL COMMITTEE COLLEGE CAN- SO AS I SAID WE'RE BUILDING ON REQUIRED WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT PLANNING IT'S IN THE FEDERAL LAW WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR FIVE YEARS. AND IS ALSO BUILDING A STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM A COLLABORATION REGIONAL ORGANIZING OF COLLEGES AROUND FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION. SO WE'RE BUILDING ON EXISTING-WORK- BUT THIS IS FOCUSED ON DEEPENING NETWORK. CONNECTING COLLEGES WORKFORCE BOARDS AFTER ALIGNMENT TO INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE DRIVING REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT AND THEN WITH THAT FOCUS ON HIGH ROAD TO HIGHER ELEMENTS OF QUALITY JBS. IN EQUITY- AND THERE IS ONE MORE PIECE. ON THE TRAINING SITE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING WORKFORCE APPRENTICESHIPS. THIS IS BUILDING ON OUR HIRING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS PARTNERSHIPS. AS I SAID IN EACH REGION OF THE STATE IS CREATING PATHWAYS IN THE STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP. AS THE STATE INVEST IN BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THIS IS A DRESSING BOTH POTENTIAL WORKFORCE SHORTAGES- WELL CREATING PATHWAYS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS IN THE TRADES FOR DISADVANTAGED WORKERS. ARE AND THEN FINALLY- AND I COULD ASK HEADED OVER TO- MY COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY WEBER THE CHANCES OF SHE WANTS ANYTHING TO THIS BODY. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR SHARE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE- IT WOULDN'T WHICH IS COORDINATION OF COLLECTING PARTICIPANT DATA- BECAUSE PARTICIPANTS ARE OFTEN THE SAME ACROSS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE AT THIS AT THE WITHIN THE LABOR AGENCY AT THE COLLEGE SO WE NEED TO COLLECT THE SAME DATA IN THE SAME WAY. TO BETTER MEASURE AND ANALYZE OUTCOMES FOR A PROGRAMS AND SO WE CAN. PUT TOGETHER GOOD REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE ON THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING- THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW COLLEGES WORK FOR SPORTS WE HOPE- THIS IS OUR INTENT TO SHARE DATA IN REAL TIME. AS TOO OFTEN JOB SEEKERS. ARE HAVING TO START OVER EVERY TIME THEY WALK INTO THE DOOR OF A NEW PROGRAM SO FOR SHARING DATA ACROSS AS PROGRAMS WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF TIME- AND HEADACHE. FOR WORKERS LOOKING FOR JOBS WHO DON'T HAVE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME- SO THOSE ARE THE FIVE COMPONENTS AND I. IF IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO REYES HOBBY HERE TO TALK ABOUT EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL IN JANUARY BURKE. TO ADD ANYTHING ON THE COLLEGE. PARK THAT PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU MISTER RAINY. YES I THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU. THIS AFTERNOON- AND THANK YOU TIM FOR PASSING UP ALL OVER TO ME- AT FIRST- IN THIS BUDGET AFTER TWO PROPOSALS COMING FROM- THAT WILL BE DELIVERED TO ETPB. I EIGHTY P. IS AN EMPLOYER AS THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYMENT TRAINING FIND AND- WE TYPICALLY SERVE- OVER FOUR THOUSAND BUSINESSES EVERY YEAR TRAINING MANY DIFFERENT WORKERS IN THE TO BUDGET OFFICE IN THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT YOU. SEE BEFORE YOU- WE'RE PROPOSING A TRAINED- SOMEWHERE AROUND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND WORKERS- THE FIRST OF BUDGET OUT THE FIRST PROPOSAL REALLY ROUGH IT REALLY IS. TO EXPAND. THE WORK THAT EACH OF YOU HAS BEEN DOING WITH. BUSINESSES AND ALL ALLOW US TO- SIR NON- BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT WOULD THEIR TYPICALLY DON'T ACCESS EGP FINES AND- AND SHE GOT OUR SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTHCARE IT- ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AND PUBLIC SECTOR. EMPLOYMENT WHICH ARE ALL BY THE WAY ARE. GOOD QUALITY PAYING JOBS- THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS TO EXPAND OUR WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONTRACT EDUCATION UNITS- AND- THE REAL INTENT BEHIND THAT PROPOSAL IS TO. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE SERVE OUR AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S SMALL BUSINESSES WERE PARTICULARLY. HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC- AND DURING THE PANDEMIC WE FOUND THAT WE WERE SERVING A GREAT DEAL OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT NEEDED THESE BUSINESS SUPPORTS AND TRAINING OF THEIR EMPLOYEES TO REACT TO THAT. AFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND WE BELIEVE THAT. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN TRAINING TO THESE SMALL BUSINESSES WELL ARE ALSO NOT JUST SUPPORT THEM COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO ACCELERATE THEIR GROWTH PROCESS SEES. THEREBY CREATING A MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND MORE- EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ECONOMY- WE ALSO LOOKED SEEKING TO INCREASE THE ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE POPULATIONS THAT ARE TRULY IN NEED AND ARE. SORT OF LEFT BEHIND BY THIS ECONOMY- AND THEN ALSO WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE SEEKING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CERTIFICATES AND CREDENTIALS THAT ARE ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND THEN LASTLY AND- I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUE SHINNY WEBER WILL SPEAK TO THIS A LITTLE BIT IS ONE OF OUR CRITICAL INTENSIVES TO DEEP IN THE BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT PROCESSES AND RELATIONSHIPS. THAT THE COMMUNITY HOW I HAS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES. IN EACH OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGION. SO WHAT THE I'D LIKE TURN IT OFF TO MICHAEL SHOULD WEBER TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY. SIDE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIR AND- I AM I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- TIM AND BATCH HAVE A VERY ELOQUENTLY SAID A LOT OF THE THINGS AND I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE. BUT D. I WANT TO I DO WANT TO STRESS THE INTEGRATION AND COLLABORATION OF WORK BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES. ARE VERY CRITICAL TO THE WORK THAT WE DO GAME REALLY FOCUSED. ON INCREASING STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES. AND ALSO PRIMARILY LOOKING AT ODD JOBS. AND EMPLOYMENT FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND OUR TO BE ABLE TO DO. INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WHICH IS REALLY THE PRIMARY FOCUS THAT WE HAVE WE REALLY NEED TO INCREASE AND DO EMPLOYER ENGAGEMENT VERY DIFFERENTLY. WHICH IS WHERE THIS PARTNERSHIP BECOMES VERY CRITICAL AND THEN ALSO EXPANDING THE WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WHERE EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIPS ARE REALLY. CRITICAL AS WELL AND SO I DON'T REALLY WANT TO- REPEAT ANYTHING. READ HAPPY TO ANSWER. ON THE- OTHER THINGS THAT I WANT TO JUST MENTION VERY QUICKLY IS. THAT YOU KNOW WE TEND TO TAG TEAM ON THIS AND- MY COLLEAGUE LIZ THAT NEVER READ BY CHANCE OR OF- COLLEGE FINANCING FACILITIES. GENERALLY IS THE LEAD ON THESE BUDGET HEARINGS AND I'M GOING TO. INVITE HER TO. PROVIDE HER COMMENTS AS WELL REPRESENTING THAT CHANCES OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER THAT ALSO STILL BLASTING OUT I JUST TO BUILD ON THIS IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY. IS THAT THEY MAY REVISION PRESENTS REALLY AS THE STATED THAT DEEP AND PROFOUND OPPORTUNITY TO DEEPEN OUR PARTNERSHIPS WHY IS THIS CROSS AGENCY COLLABORATION NECESSARY THE REALITY IS THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. OR UNDEREMPLOYED AS A RESULT OF THIS PANDEMIC DON'T SEE AGENCY LINES THEY JUST KNOW THAT THEY NEED ASSISTANCE IN FINDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL MOBILITY SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S INCUMBENT ON US AS A CALIFORNIA COLLEGES LABOR AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. TO COLLABORATE AND STREAMLINE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED US THE LAST PIECE ALL ADDED IT WE DO RESPECTFULLY URGE FOR CONSIDERATION OF GREATER CHANCES OFFICE CUT CAPACITY BY WAY OF THIS POSITIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE IMPORTANT NEW AND EXPANDED INITIATIVES THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGES ARE THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY SERVING TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES. WE HAVE FEWER THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THIS CRITICAL WORK POSSIBLE STAFFING CAPACITY WILL ENSURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL AND ULTIMATELY MEET THE NEEDS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS COUNTING ON US FOR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU- CENTER AND QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO THANK YOU I'M IF I CAN'T- SENATOR CRITICIZING. NO THAK YOU THANK YOU- I DO- MAYBE IF MAYBE THIS IS DIRECTED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT ANYONE COULD COULD ANSWER MY QUESTION IS HOW TO HOLD UP THE EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE TO ANY JOB COMMITMENTS OR THE QUALITY OF THE JOB COMMITMENTS OR- IF THEY'RE DOING TRAINING THAT THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING THE REACHING OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY- LIVED OUT IN THE REASON. I ASK ABOUT THAT IS BECAUSE- AND ACCESS I MENTIONED TO US SECRETARY SUE OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION IF IT'S PUT OUT THERE AS A COMMITMENT THEN OUR PUBLIC ACCESS AND THE REASON I RAISE THIS IS BECAUSE FOR TWO YEARS I HAD A ON. MOST TRYING TO GET LEGISLATION THROUGH THAT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE IT BASICALLY SAID THAT IF YOU'RE THE RECIPIENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS WHO PROMISED TO CREATE JOBS IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT YOU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW GETTING INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF JOBS THE TYPE OF JOBS THEY CREATED. WELL BASICALLY WHAT DID THEY PROMISE IN RETURN FOR OF THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS- AND MY BILL WAS I HAVE THE LETTER WAS OPPOSED OF BY COMPANIES WHO SAID THAT IF THEY WERE REQUIRED INCLUDING APPLYING FOR- THE ETP FINDING THAT IF THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE- TRANSPARENT WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE. ALL WHICH WAS QUITE SURPRISING TO ME SO MY QUESTION IS AND THAT WAS A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSAL THERE- MY QUESTION IS HOW DO WE HOLD- EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. TO THESE COMMITMENTS AND HOW ARE WE ASSURE OUR TAXPAYER THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. SO WHO WANTS TO ENSURE DANIELLE BRANDON- THANK I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL AM I DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE HANDY FOR THAT AND BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT TO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES- ATP OR THE BOARD IF. THEY HAVE A RESPONSE FOR YOU. THANK YOU. YES SIR MADAM CHAIR RESTAURANT HERE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL- FOR EGP OUR PANEL ACTUALLY DOES- HOLDER- BUSINESSES- THAT WE WORK WITH ACCOUNTABLE TO. A HIGHER STANDARD SO THEY SET THRESHOLDS FOR FINDING- THAT THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF- SALARY- REQUIREMENTS OR CERTAIN DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO I FEEL LIKE- THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO. ENSURE THAT- WERE CONTRIBUTING TO IT- THE CREATION OF GOOD QUALITY JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AS A MATTER OF FACT DURING THE PANDEMIC- EACH OF THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL PUT IN PLACE- A PROGRAM. CALLED THE CODED PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WAS WHICH ACTED REALLY IS AN INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYERS TO HIRE AND TRAIN WORKERS A LIVABLE WAGE JOBS AND- BLIGHTED BY THE END OF THIS PROGRAM YOU'RE WILL HAVE PUT OUT MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND NOT FIND CREATING MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE GOOD PAYING QUALITY JOBS SO I FEEL LIKE- YOU KNOW. THE RESOURCES THAT WE BE USING UTILIZING TO THESE PROGRAMS WOULD. HOLD BUSINESSES ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU- MISTER. THANK YOU TRAVIS ALLEN- FROM THE L'ANNO. ON I THINK WE'LL START- WITH SOME BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT THE OVERALL NAY REVISION WORK FIRST PROPOSALS AND THEN TURN TO OTHER SPECIFIC ITEMS HERE IN THIS ISSUE- THANK. FIRST WHAT WE AGREED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PANDEMIC HAS CLEARLY LAID BARE LONGSTANDING ECONOMIC INEQUITIES IN THE STATE'S LABOR MARKETS AND ALSO GREETED MINISTRATION AND NOW IS THE TIME TO. TO THINK ABOUT. STATE POLICIES AND STRUCTURES GOING FORWARD ON. SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I SPENT THE WEEKEND ASSEMBLING. A LIST OF THE WORKFORCE RELATED PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION THIS YEAR I'M AND WE MUST ADDRESS EARLIER THIS WEEK AND HAND OUT FORM. ON ACROSS ALL OF STATE GOVERNMENT THERE MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE WORKFORCE RELATED PROPOSALS THAT ARE NEW IN THE MAY REVISION IN TOTAL MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. I'M SORRY YOUR HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS REGARDING THROUGH THE BROAD PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS. ON WE FIND THAT SOME OF THE NEW PROPOSALS- WARRANT THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION AND PRINCIPALLY THESE ARE PROPOSALS THAT ARE EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SHOWN PROMISE. IN WHICH THE STATE HAS CAPACITY TO BUILD ON. BUT MANY OF THE PROPOSALS HAVE SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS OUR- FIRST MANY OF THEM ARE BRAND NEW AND LACKS KEY INFORMATION. FOR EXAMPLE- THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ­S SECRETARY SUE LAID OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS AGENDA. IS DETAILED IN A SINGLE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WE RECEIVED AND THEY'RE PRICED RELATIVELY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE. COMPONENTS WE DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH THIS. ON OTHER ARE RELATED ISSUES- SO X. OUR GRANT PROGRAM AT AN ENTITY WELL BEYOND THEIR EXISTING MANAGEMENT CAPACITY WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN GET THOSE GRANTS OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER I TO AFFECT THE PANDEMIC CONDITIONS WE ALSO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT- DUPLICATION OF EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ENTITIES- AND ECHO YOUR CONCERNS MADAM CHAIR ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ON SO SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSAL'S HERE THESE ARE THE COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S SO CALLED JOBS PACKAGE ON IT OR NOT LEAVE THE LARGEST OF THAT ECONOMIC RESILIENCY FONG WAS WILL HEAR NEXT. AND I THINK YOU'RE VERY SORT OF TWO GROUPS THERE ARE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS OUR WORKFORCE FOR AN E. OR EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THIS FALLS IN THAT FIRST GROUP OF- COMMENTS WE MADE THESE EXPANSIONS TOP WARRANT SERIOUS LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION OTHER LIKELY WITHIN THE CAPACITY OF THESE ENTITIES TO MANAGE A TIMELY FASHION ON IN THE STATE HAVE SOME FAMILIARITY BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE ON A LARGE COMPONENT OF THAT IS A NINETY MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION TO THE HIGH ROPES TRAINING PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE STATE'S FLAGSHIP WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AT THE BORDER. ON THE ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN OTHER PROPOSALS ARE RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RAISES MORE SERIOUS CONCERNS ON OFFICE ON THE FIRST COMPONENT IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS I TO ESTABLISH FUTURE T. P.'S THAT ALIGN WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE PATHWAYS ON THIS SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE DUPLICATIVE WITH THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE WHICH IS A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. OUR ONGOING FUNDED PROGRAM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- TO FORM APPRENTICESHIPS IN NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT PROGRAMS CURRENTLY- UNDER UTILISED AS WE'RE NOT SURE. TO WHAT DEGREE THESE MIGHT BE DUPLICATIVE THE SECOND BOZELL'S MILLION OF THE AGAIN FOR. TO READ FOR HOT. SO EQUITY PARTNERS WITH THE CA HOW. ON NRF. BRIEF REVIEW OF WHAT THE FOR IS AVAILABLE THIS LIKE IT MIGHT BE RELATIVE DEEPLY OF STATE'S A- STRONG WORK FOR PROGRAM THE COMMUTER COLLEGES. THAT PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO. COLLABORATE WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS- TO IMPROVE- EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS AND THE SUPPORT INDUSTRY SPECIFIC ACCREDITATION SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WHAT THE NEW FUNDING WOULD DO- THAT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO TODAY. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH E. P. R. TO EXPAND OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGH CONTRACT EDUCATION AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AGAIN THIS SEEMS POTENTIALLY. DUPLICATIVE AND POTENTIALLY ON NEEDED ON THIS STATE.

JOB CREATORS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY CRUCIAL SUPPORT FOR THEM IN THAT PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU- I JUST WANT TO- SORT OF. SORRY REPEAT OF THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE AND THIS GOES BOTH TO LABOR AGENCY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- AND TO L. A. O. IS. THAT WE- I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS. INFORMATION THAT WHEN THERE'S A COMMITMENT MADE TO JOBS AND CERTAIN KINDS OF JOBS THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT- IS NOT GOING TO BE- THE SYSTEM THAT WILL BLOCK US FROM GETTING ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION AND I SAY THAT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF MY UNFORTUNATE- EXPERIENCE IN- AND SEEN THE POSITION OF THE- FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THAT ABSOLUTELY REFUSED AND SAID IT WAS NOT- IT WAS NOT AND- SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD AGREE TO DO SO- I CAN APPRECIATE MR- HOW DID YOUR EXPLANATION ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE TRAINING. BUT UP I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A THE PUBLIC NOT JUST MAYOR YOU'RE NOT A ONE OFF HERE AND THERE ARE WANT ABSOLUTE- TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC FOR ALL THESE- WHAT REALLY OURS THE BILL PROBABLY BE A HISTORIC INVESTMENT. IN WORKFORCE- TRAINING AND I HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- AND THEY'RE JUST THERE REALLY ARE A MODEL THAT'S GOTTEN BETTER BETTER THROUGH THE YEARS- BUT- THE REST OF THESE FUNDS THE REST OF THESE PROGRAMS. I DON'T HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE OR A BAD EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY SO I'D REALLY URGE EVERYONE. TO MAKE THAT- CRYSTAL CLEAR- IN THIS BUDGET THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH- THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY IN YOUR HARD WORK EVERY DAY. LET'S SEE WE'RE GOING ON TO THAT WAS HELD OPEN SIX MARIN THE RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT I'M ON. NOW ON SIX OKAY ISSUE SIX COMMUNITY ECONOMIC. RESILIENCE ON. BUT AFTER EVERYONE- THIS IS ZERO- NINE. I'M A SENIOR ADVISER BRIDGE IN THE- IN THE GUY OFFICE OF THE PLAN RESEARCH I TO THANK YOU INVITING ME TO SHARE OF THE- THINKING AROUND THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE FUNDS- SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS- I THINK THAT SECRETARY SU LAID OUT THE VISION PRETTY CLEARLY WHAT I HOPE TO DO HERE IS TO SORT OF LAY OUT PRETTY BROADLY THE THINKING BEHIND THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FINE. WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH IT THE POINT OF IT AND THEN- GOING TO SOME DETAILS- AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'RE PREPARED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WHICH I NOW- LA- AND OTHERS HAVE FORWARDED TO US SO WE CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS ON THAT AS WELL- SO I JUST WANTED TO RE EMPHASIZE THE POINT OF THE FUNDING GIVEN THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD IT I THINK THIS. WILL TIED TO THAT VERY MUCH SO THAT. WE CARE ABOUT TRANSFERRED WITH. ABOUT JOB CALL. BUT HAVE TO. THOSE JOBS RIGHT H. R. TV IS DO NOT CREATE JOBS WE HAVE TO MAKE THE JOB TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FUND DOES. SO THE COMMUNITY CAN RELATE FUNDS AIMS TO BUILD WRIT LARGE THIS IS A TRANSITION TO A NEW ECONOMY THIS IS A MORE SUSTAINABLE A MORE RESILIENT A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. AND THE FUND IS DESIGNED TO DEPLOY THIS ONCE IN A GENERATION SURPLUS. TO ADDRESS TO ESSENTIAL CHALLENGES RIGHT SO THE FIRST ONE- AS SECRETARY SU SAID IS ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM A PANDEMIC. THAT WE KNOW IMPACTED CALIFORNIA'S REGIONS AND POPULATIONS AND INDUSTRIES VERY DIFFERENTLY- AND WE KNOW ALSO AS WE'VE SAID- YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THROUGHOUT- THAT THIS IS- REVEALED THAT THAT. WE DON'T EVEN INEQUALITY IN THE PRE PANDEMIC ECONOMY WAS ALSO FOR NOTABLE BUT IT DOESN'T OTHER THING IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE RECOVER. HE THINKS ABOUT HOW WE- FORWARD. HOW DO WE MAKE A TREND. TO A HIGHER ECONOMY HOW DO WE MAKE A TRANSITION SPECIFICALLY TO CARBON NEUTRALITY- AND SO THIS IS PART IN PARCEL RECOVERY I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IN A WAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF. DO GOOD BY DOING CLIMATE WORK BUT THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY INOCULATION IN CALIFORNIA. IS IMPACTED BY OR WILL IMPACT. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALSO BECAUSE- CARBON NEUTRALITY IS RIGHT NOW. A A DRIVER OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. SO IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO RETAIN ITS COMPETITIVENESS. AND COMPETE AND INNOVATION AND ITS RECORD AS A STATE ECONOMY THAT TO PLAY IN THE SPACE IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT SO NOT JUST FOR SORT OF- CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. AND LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS BUT ALSO PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND I ALSO SAY THAT. JUST SO WE DON'T THINK WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT. CARBON NEUTRALITY THE TRANSITION IS ALSO A CHANCE FOR US TO GET IN THIS FUND HELPS US GET IN FRONT OF HELP EVERY REGION GET IN FRONT OF THE MACROECONOMIC CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE EVERY. DAY AUTUMN IS A ASIAN. GLOBAL IS- THE KINDS OF- THE KINDS OF IN THAT ARE. A READ AND IF JOB AND ENDS THERE SO THIS A WAY UP. ALL OF THAT- IN A WAY OF. ALLOWS READ TO DO. A FUTURE CALL. THAT IS- OF THE STATE OF. SO LET ME SAY NOW THAT THE- CREEK THING ABOUT THIS FAR IS THAT IT IS A REGION. OFF WE HER YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. WE THE LEAD. LEAD ON THIS WE HAVE HEARD YOU READ. YOUR BECAUSE- THAT IS THE STATE JOB SWOOP IN DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS IN REGIONAL ECONOMIES. RIGHT BUT THE IDEA IS THAT- THE STATE REALLY CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT DETERMINE. THE DESTINY OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC REGIONS WE SEE OUR ROLE IN THIS IS THE ROLES IS WHEN WE DESIGNED THE FUN LIKE THIS- BUILT AS I WILL MENTION- VERY MUCH OF SOME STRUCTURES THAT WE- ADMIRED AND FOLLOWED. FROM YOUR LEAD INCLUDING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS IS. AB ONE OF SIX BUT MORE ON THAT LATER WHAT WE SEE OUR ROLE ESSENTIALLY IS PROVIDING. RESOURCES FOR THE REGION TO SHE THEIR TRAY. BECAUSE WHAT MAKES SENSE. IN A FOR A CAN. IN THE C. THAT IS. WITH WHILE FIRE. WITH AND A COLLAPSE. IN IN THE NEED TO STAY UP BY. FEEDS IN- AND- WHAT PRODUCT. IS DIFFERENT THAN. HAPPENING IN THE VALLEY. MANAGING GROUND- REDUCTION BECAUSE OF. IN AGRA TRADE. OR REALLY IN THE CURRENT WHICH BY THE WAY INCREDIBLY NOT REALLY GAS IN THIS. GOING HUNDRED TRY. IN LA SO WHAT LOTS OF THINGS BY. AND BY AND SO WANT TO GIVE THOSE REGIONS THE CHAIN TO DECIDE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR OWN. THE OTHER THING THAT. WE WANT TO DO TO OUR SUPPORT THE IN SO. AND INCLUDES TAPE. RIGHT WHERE LOCALS. COME TO DO TO. AS I SAID THERE. FUTURE. BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T. WHAT TO DO BUT WE DO PUT SOME GUARDRAILS ON THE MONEY SO WE DO A COUPLE THINGS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SAY. IN WHO IS AT THE TABLE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A PLACE FOR LABOR SO THAT WORKERS HAVE A SAY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A PLACE FOR COMMUNITY VOICES ESPECIALLY. BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR- THAT HAVE TOO OFTEN BEEN LEFT OUT OF DECISION MAKING- AS WELL AS- BUSINESSES. GOVERNMENT THE LAND TO BE EDUCATION THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM THE SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM SO IT IS A BIG TABLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE VOICES HAVE NOT FULLY BEEN HURT. SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SEND A HIGH ROAD AGENDA. THERE WILL BE METRICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY THERE WILL BE I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE WILL BE NO DOLLAR THAT GOES OUT THE DOOR WITHOUT AN EVALUATION. PLAN AND I'VE BEEN A METRICS PLANT BUT- REALLY LARGE THE METRICS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND THE HIGH ROAD WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT AS SECRETARY SU EXPLAINED AS- SUSTAINABILITY. SO HOW DOES ANY OF THIS INVESTMENT ALIGNS THE STATE'S CLIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS THERE WILL BE EQUITY METRICS. HOW IS THIS ADVANCE INCLUSIVITY HOUSES LIFT UP ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT EVERYONE BENEFITS IN THE TRANSITION- HOW DOES THIS ADDRESS JOB QUALITY. WHICH AS DIRECTOR RAINY DESCRIBED SO ELOQUENTLY WE CANNOT DELIVER EQUITY WITHOUT JOB QUALITY SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO CREATE THOSE GOOD JOBS HOW ARE WE GOING TO TRACK THAT THEY'RE PRETTY GOOD JOBS. ALL OF THESE THINGS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT FROM THE INVESTMENTS. I'M THE KIND OF THING THAT SUPPORTS. REALLY ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT BENEFITS LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS I SAID LOOK VERY DIFFERENT. IN EVERY REGION BUT IN EVERY SINGLE REGION IT WILL LIFT UP FAMILIES. AND WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES AND- ALSO CRITICALLY THE TAX BASE. RIGHT MANY REASONS WHICH DEPEND ON PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR TAX BASE OR SEE THAT DECLINE OR HAVE SEEN A DECLINE. AND SO. HOW WE BUILD THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN EACH REGION THAT CALIFORNIANS DESERVE AND RESPECT SO THAT'S REALLY THINKING ABOUT THIS INVESTMENT THAT HAS TO. LIFT UP COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THEN. DISTRIBUTION I WILL SAY IS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WE WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT THERE IS INVESTMENT IN REGIONS. WHICH HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. WHICH HAVE. BORNE THE- GREATEST BROWN OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHAU. AND THOSE INLAND REGIONS THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN LEFT OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S STORIED ECONOMIC PROSPERITY RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WITH THIS MYSELF THIS MONEY IS COMPETITIVE BUT IS ALSO GUARANTEED TO GO TO EVERY REGION. AND THE LAST THING I WILL SAY BEFORE WE GO INTO MORE DETAILS IS THAT THIS IS PART OF. AND I THINK BOTH HIM AND- SECRETARY SUE EMPHASIZED THIS IS PART OF A COHERENT COME BACK VISION IT IS NOT FRAGMENTED IN FACT. THIS WILL CONNECT TO ALL INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE BUDGET NOT ONLY TO THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS AND HRT PIECE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS- BUT IT CONNECTS TO. COMMUNITY CAPACITY INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE LIFTED UP AND PRIORITIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT TEN SEVENTY TWO INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE WRITTEN IN ON. THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT DO THIS WORK UNLESS WE BUILD CAPACITY IN COMMUNITY GROUPS TO JOIN IN THE WORK AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO THERE'S A SEPARATE FUNDING FOR THAT THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PACKAGE. AND OTHER PLACES THAT WE ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THAT SO THAT'S NOT IN SORT OF NAME ONLY THIS BIG TASK- WE ARE. CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE. INVEST THERE HAVE BECAUSE- THE BUDGET IN. HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION IN ENERGY- AND BECAUSE THESE WILL ALSO TAKE PLACE IN REGIONS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE PART OF THIS ECONOMIC PLAN- AND WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT- THESE ARE ALL. THESE ARE ALL ISSUES WITHIN THEIR OWN DISTINCT. AND CRITICAL PIECES OF- OF THE RECOVERY IN OF THE TRANSITION AND WE THINK NONE OF THEM ARE EXTRANEOUS AND WE REALLY ARE STRUGGLING NOT STRUGGLING BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMBINING ALL THE THINGS TOGETHER ACROSS THE BUDGET SO TRANSIT NO IS YOU AND- YOUR COLLEAGUES LOOK AT THIS OVER THE WEEKENDS WE ALSO HAVE STRUGGLED TO PULL THESE THINGS TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A SINGLE COHERENT STORY BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S THE WAY. TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE AND THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY TO INVEST AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LIFTS UP ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT'S THE THINKING BEHIND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER- THE SPECIFICS ON THE STRUCTURE AND INVESTMENTS- AND I CAN ALSO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE SENT TO US. IN ADVANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO PURSUE THOSE- AND- MY COLLEAGUE- I CALLED THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING LIKELY TO RAINY IS ALSO HERE- TO HELP US TALK ABOUT THE WAY THAT THIS INTERSECTS- WITH THE H. R. P. P. IS WAS COMPLETELY. DISTINCT FUNDING STREAM. THANK YOU MISS WHITE- DOES THE L. A. O. WANT TO COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JAZZ ALAMO AGAIN FROM THE L. L. ON THE OTHER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR SHE ECONOMIC RESILIENCY FUND- WOULD IT. FIRST I SHOULD SAY ARE THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT ABOUT THE PROPOSED FUND AT THIS TIME- IT IS INCLUDED IN THE OMNIBUS JOBS PACKAGE B. C. P. AND THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS RATHER SHORT ON SO WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT THE FUN ONE THING I WOULD POINT OUT THOUGH. IS THAT THE PHONE PROPOSES TO USE. SORT OF GRANT FUNDING IN TWO STAGES FIRST WITH. OUR PLANNING GRANTS TO THE REGION'S A SMALLER AMOUNT IS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWED BY IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS FOR THE BULK OF THE FUNDING. ON IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US AT THIS TIME THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO APPROVE THE ENTIRE BUDGETED AMOUNT. RIGHT NOW- ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO GO FOR WITH ANY GRANTS LOANS ON EVERY IS THIS QUESTION PART BECAUSE- THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES THAT. THROUGH THE SEATS THINKING WORK FOR THE FUND ITSELF. RESIDES IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S. JUST TRANSITION ROAD MAP WHICH IS A REPORT WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS YEAR- AND BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T CHANCE. ON GIVEN THAT HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET TO WEIGH IN WILL PROVIDE COMMENTS OR FEEDBACK JUST CONSIDER THE REPORT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT TO MOVE FORWARD. I WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ON HOW TO ANSWER ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS- ON ICE OUR OFFICE CHAIRS WITH BROAD GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. UP WITH THE PANDEMIC RECOVERY- BUT IT'S A MATTER OF OUT. OF LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW KEY DETAILS ON ONE OF THE KEY DETAILS THAT WE WOULD RAISE YOUR ATTENTION HAS TO DO WITH GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU BROUGHT UP EARLIER. THE FUND IS PROPOSED TO BE ADMINISTERED BY. JOINTLY BY OPR LABOR AGENCY AND COPIOUS BUT THE GRANT WOULD BE IN IMPLEMENTED OUR OR DISTRIBUTED BY THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. I'M SO THIS IS FOR ENTITIES OBVIOUSLY RELATED BUT FOR DISTINCT ENTITIES THAT WOULD GOVERN AND ADMINISTER THE FUND. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD GO TO- FOR PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO DETERMINE HOW WELL THE FUNDS WORKING. ON OTHER PROJECTS ARE GOING FORWARD OR TO SUGGEST TO DEMAND CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM- IN FUTURE YEARS ALSO THIS IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE. WE LEGISLATURE- THERE IS MORE I DETAIL ABOUT THE MOVING THANK. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEPART OF FINE. WHO IS THE MISTER. YES MA'AM HI DANIELLE AGAIN MADAM CHAIR FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO I DIDN'T- MY COLLEAGUES FLIGHTS THAT TESTIMONY BUT I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR FINANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST HAVE HOPEFULLY ONE SHORT- QUESTION AND THAT IS SINCE THIS IS- THESE ARE FEDERAL DOLLARS RIGHT THAT WILL BE USED. FOR THIS FUND- ARE THERE ANY. RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS- EIGHT IF THERE ARE- IN THAT SHORT ANSWER GIVE IT TO US TODAY IF IT TAKES MORE EXPLANATION WE CAN WE CAN GET IT FROM YOU BUT ARE THERE ANY RULES OF. FEDERAL RULES OR RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW THE FUNDING IS USED. MISTER WHO CAN ANSWER THAT. I CAN YOUR FRIEND WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THESE FUNDS- AND I WOULD DEFER TO ADD ANYBODY ELSE SAID- ON ME TEAM HAS ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT WE BELIEVE THIS IS INELIGIBLE USE. AND WONDERING- MANAGER BY IF YOU BARK FURTHER COMMENTS I COULD RESPONSE TO THE OF THE QUESTIONS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE L. A. O. SO. SURE WE CAN KEEP YOUR ANSWERS SHORT THANK AND SALUTE- THERE'S A LOT TO SAY I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THE- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THERE IS. THIS IS DESIGNED TO HAVE A CABINET LEVEL INTER AGENCY WORK GROUP OF THE THREE AGENCIES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT PRIMARILY A WORKFORCE- FUNCTION AS PRIMARILY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION IS TIED CLOSELY TO JOBS AND WORKFORCE SO. THE IDEA IS THAT THERE IS A FREE MARKET GUIDELINES THE DECISIONS THE VALUATION METRICS IS ALL ABOUT TAKING CARE OF A CABINET DEPUTY LEVEL- SENIOR. WE ARE HAPPY I WAS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS WE ARE HAPPY TO SET UP A SCHEDULED TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT. THE IDEA WAS A NIMBLE FUND- THAT WE COULD STREAMLINE THE STATE'S ROLE UP FRONT TO GET THE MONEY OUT TO THE REGION'S AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE LABOR AGENCY YES BUT THE DECISION MAKING. ARE THE ACCOUNTABILITY WE ALL THE HEALTH- AT THAT CABIN A LITTLE. US SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THAT IS A WORKABLE- SOLUTION- AND ACCOUNTABLE SOLUTION. THE THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP IS THAT. WE HAD THIS ONCE IN A- LIFETIME RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST THIS FUND IT WOULD BE CRAZY TO COME UP WITH THE ROADMAP AND THEN SAY THERE'S NO MONEY TO DO ANYTHING RIGHT. AND THIS IS ALSO I THINK THE IDEA OF STAGED INVESTMENTS IS ACTUALLY INTRIGUING BUT- I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE FOLKS HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE PLANNING AND WE NEED TO PLAN BEFORE WE INVEST THE MONEY BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE. INVESTMENT LIFTED UP BEHIND IT WE ALSO SCHEDULED IN HERE. TO LET SOME OF THE MONEY GO EARLY BECAUSE FOLKS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS PLANNING IN THE REGION- SO SOME OF THAT COULD BE- PILOTED. THE ROADMAP LET ME SAY SB THREE MORE AND WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT. REGIONS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO DO INDUSTRIAL PLANNING TO DO WORKFORCE PLANNING AS YOU ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION THE H. R. TWO BEES TO THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PEACE. AND THAT THE RESILIENCE FUNDS DOES THE INDUSTRIAL PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION THAT'S WHAT THE ROADMAP SAYS IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE IT'S A FRAMEWORK- THAT CALLS FOR THAT AND CLOSE KNIT LIVED UP I MEAN THIS IS WHAT WE WERE PROPOSING- AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT. THAT WE'RE GOING HERE BUDGET PROCESS RIGHT NOW SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT I UNDERSTAND- SINCE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT'S IN IT- WE THINK THIS ALIGNS WELL WITH IT BUT THERE'S NOT A SORT OF SECRET AGENDA IN THAT- SO. WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE FUNDING AND LEADERSHIP ABOR AGENCY AS WELL. WE ARE CONVINCED THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY- GREAT THANK YOU MISS WHITE- WE SEEN MORE OF COURSE. ARE CALM. WE YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION WE'RE HOLDING THIS OPEN. AND WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. WHICH IS NOW ON TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TANK THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. THANK YOU SECRETARY SOOOO AND EVERYONE- FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. EVERY SINGLE DAY PRESHEAF YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WE AREN'T ISSUE SEVEN A CALTRANS OF BUDGET SUMMARY. WHO WANTS TO MAKE THAT PRESENTATION WHO'S HERE. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YEAH MY NAME IS THE STEPHEN CARE ACT I'M THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF CALTRANS AND I'LL BE PRESENTING ON BUT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE OUR NORMAL OR REGULAR- MAY REVISED PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM. AND THEN IN THE NEXT I'LL TAKE UP THE LARGER MORE COMPREHENSIVE- TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. SO FOR OUR TRADITIONAL MAY REVISE FINANCE LETTERS WE HAVE A FOR A TOTAL FINANCE OTHERS NO I'LL BE BRIEF IN GOING THROUGH THEM. THE FIRST IS A- IS A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM REQUEST FOR THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN POSITIONS FOR- IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY FOR LEGAL SERVICES THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WILL YOU PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES IN THE AREA OF- REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION AND- MANAGEMENT AS WELL- SO THESE RESOURCES WILL BE USED- FIRING PROPERTIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY MADERA TO CHAPTER STATEMENT AND THERE'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED- PARCELS REMAINING. IN THAT AREA. THE NEXT FINANCE LETTER THAT WE HAVE. IS A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM REQUEST FOR TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY POSITIONS. DO ESTABLISH IN CAN'T MAKE ORDINATORS TO MITIGATE SAFETY RISK I THINK THE PAYMENTS ON STATE PROPERTY- THESE- POSITIONS WELL PRIMARILY LIAISE WITH THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCIAL COUNSEL. AND FOR- WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO CONNECT THESE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO SERVICES AND TO HOUSING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A- QUITE A NECESSARY STEP IN DEVELOPING A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS. DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD TO JUST MOVE THE PROBLEM FROM ARE RIGHT AWAY TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S WE NEED TO- TO- HELP COORDINATE- SERVICES FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE NEXT ITEM IS A PERMANENT INCREASE OF TEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSE- TO IMPLEMENT A REPLACEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE MOST CRITICAL END OF LIFE IT ELEMENTS ARE IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THIS IS BORN OF A RECOMMENDATION- THEY CAME OUT OF THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED IN IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY APPLICATION ROADMAP STUDY. THAT WAS A STUDY THAT WAS FUNDED EMPIRE BUDGET ACT TO HAVE US LOOK AT WHAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO DO- TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR IT SYSTEMS. THIS IS BEYOND WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF AS AN ID SYSTEM IN IN THE NORMAL POWER PLANTS THIS IS- THESE ARE INCLUDE SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL- FREEWAY TRAFFIC ARE RAMPS AROUND METRES LIGHTS AND LANES- AND EVEN- CONTRIBUTES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES. IN THE FINAL OF THE FOR TRADITIONAL MAY REVISE FINANCE LETTERS IS A REQUEST FOR A FIVE POINT. FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TEN POSITIONS IN ONE TIME FUNDING- IN COSTS RELATED TO THE CURRENT PHASE OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NETWORK. DATA SAFETY DATA SYSTEM- REPLACE OUR PROJECT. THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NETWORK IS A SAFETY DATA SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES VALUABLE DATA- AND ANALYSIS AND HELPS US A CALTRANS ACHIEVE OUR GOALS IN REDUCING THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF TRAFFIC COLLISIONS. THE CURRENT AS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NETWORK DATA SYSTEM COVERS LESS THAN 10% OF THE ROADWAY NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA. AND FEDERAL MANDATES REQUIRED STATES HAVE A SEAT IT SYSTEM TO PERFORMANCE YES IN ALICE'S SUPPORTING BOTH THE STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN. IN THE HIGHWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM- SO WE KNEW UPDATED AT TRANSPORTATION SIFT SYSTEM NETWORKS ET DATA SYSTEM- WITH ALL THE REQUIRED CAPABILITIES WILL PROVIDE A SUPPORT I'M SORRY WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ADVANCE STATE DENOUNCES. AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND IMPROVE ROADWAY SAFETY. THOSE ARE THE FOUR TRADITIONAL ITEMS AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT- ISSUE IN YOUR TENTH.

I'M ON THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NETWORK REPLACEMENT. TO THE EXTENT THIS IS A NEW ITEM IS PART OF THE REVISED- IS THERE A REASON WHY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. ALL RIGHT HEY YES ACTUALLY SO WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THIS ISSUE AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT FUNDING THIS FIRST STEP IN IN REPLACEMENT OF THE- THE ITEM. BUT WE HAD- ATTEMPTED TO GO DOWN ANOTHER PATH FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- IT KIND OF FELL THROUGH AND SO WE CAME AND WORKED OUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO BRING IT FORWARD TO LEGISLATURE IS PART OF- AS PART OF THIS- US. PRESIDENT THANK THANK YOU. OKAY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS SENATE QUARTERS EIGHT NO COMMENTS QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU OF MR CHARACTER ON THIS ISSUE SEVEN WE MOVE ON HOLDING AN OPEN ISSUE EIGHT S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE. THAT YOU MISTER TECH AND YES I WILL START OFF GIVING A SLIGHTLY MORE LENGTHY OVERVIEW OF THIS PACKAGE AND THEN OF COURSE- THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE ONLINE READY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR THIS ONE. SO THE MAIN REBEL TO THE TRANSPORTATION BUDGET PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND OF COURSE- OF ON MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE PROPOSING OVER ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF STATE INVESTMENT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO PROPEL IT EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND POSITION THE STATE TO PURSUE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE QUALITY JOBS AND ACCELERATE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SUPPORT CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND PROVIDE BETTER CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALTRANS CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG OF MAINTENANCE AND HIGHWAY REPAIRS ON THE SYSTEM ARE USING THE VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN TRANSPORTATION REVENUES PROVIDED THROUGH SB 1% BUT WANT. ALTHOUGH REDUCE TRAVEL DURING THE CODE PERIOD HAS MARGINALLY AFFECTED TO FORECASTED REVENUE OBVIOUSLY IN A DOWNWARD TREND- WE'VE SEEN- REDUCE TRAFFIC ON ROADWAYS ESPECIALLY DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND AN ANTICIPATED BID SAVINGS THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO ACCELERATE PROJECTS AND WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS USING AVAILABLE. USING USING ALREADY AVAILABLE FUNDING. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS YEAR THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WILL RELEASE THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO KNOWN AS CAPTAIN. THIS ACTION PLAN IS THE PRODUCT OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT INCLUDED A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND IS MEANT TO BE A UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORK FOR ALIGNING STATE TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS WITH CLINICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. FRAMEWORK INCLUDES GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND STRATEGIES TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA TOWARDS A MORE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION. I'M MORE SPECIFIC TO THE MAY REVISE THE PACKAGE INCLUDES ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND RELATED ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ACTIVITIES AND I'LL TRY TO WALK THROUGH EACH OF THOSE ARE IN AND IN TURN. THE FIRST IS A ONE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT TO DELIVER CRITICAL PROJECTS IN TIME FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC GAMES THE LOS ANGELES AREA. THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW- I'M SORRY THESE FUNDS WILL FLOW THROUGH THE- CURRENTLY EXISTING TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION EIGHT. THE NEXT INVESTMENT IS A ONE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT FOR HIGH PRIORITY TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS STATEWIDE THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THOSE I JUST MENTIONED THAT WOULD IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN STATE AND REGIONAL LOCAL SERVICE THESE TIMES BUT ALSO FLOW THROUGH THE TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM. THE NEXT INVESTMENT IS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT FOR PROJECTS- THROUGH THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT INCREASE WALKING AND BIKING THAT INCREASES SAFETY AND MOBILITY OF NON MOTORIZED% USERS. AND THAT ADVANCE GREENHOUSE. REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. THESE PROJECTS ALSO ENHANCE PUBLIC HEALTH AND BENEFIT MANY TYPES OF USERS ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THESE FUNDS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE USED FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY. BEEN THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS- AND THEN JUST AS BEEN ENOUGH TO KEEP UP MAY. AND THIS WILL SOME OF THE PROJECTS TO RECEIVE SOME HIGH SCORE. THE NEXT IN. IN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR IN GENERAL FUND TO- CRITICAL STATE IMPROVEMENTS AT. GREAT IN THIS IS A C. WHERE YOU HAVE A- A RAIL OR LIGHT RAIL CROSSING A HIGHWAY OR STREET AT THE SAME LEVEL. THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS THAT WE TRY TO MITIGATE WHATEVER WE CAN'T- BY SEPARATING THEM TO TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS- THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- M. INVESTMENT WILL HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL ONES ACROSS THE STATE. THE NEXT ISSUE IS A FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. CONSTRUCTION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ADVANCE WORK FOR SERVICE BETWEEN HER SAID IN BAKERSFIELD. AND ADVANCED PLANNING AND PROJECT DESIGN FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT. THIS INVESTMENT WILL ALSO LEVERAGE POTENTIAL FUTURE FEDERAL. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES SUPPORT AND SUPPORT STAFF NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE EXPANDED WORKLOAD AS WELL. THE NEXT ITEM IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. THAT'S ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR IN DOLLARS AND SPECIAL TIMES AND AT NINE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ADVANCEMENT OF PRIORITY STATE HIGHWAY OPERATIONS PROTECTION PROGRAM PROJECTS THOSE ARE OUR BREAD AND BUTTER MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECTS. AND ALSO INTER REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. AS WELL AS LOCAL ROAD AND BRIDGE INVESTMENTS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE NEXT INVESTMENT IS A FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN ZERO EMISSION RAIL AND TRANSIT EQUIPMENT PURCHASES INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS FUNDING IS A HUNDRED MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNT FUNDING AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION FROM FEDERAL. THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE AND PURCHASE OR LEASE STATE OF THE ART CLEAN BUS AND RAIL EQUIPMENT AND TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP ELIMINATE FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS AND INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF INTERCITY RAIL AND INTERCITY BUS SERVICE. AND FINALLY- THESE INVESTMENTS THERE'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS IN ZERO EMISSION USING ZERO EMISSION BUSES AND TRUCKS THIS IS ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND- AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION IN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL. THIS MONEY WILL BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE AND PURCHASE OR LEASE GREEN BUSES AND TRUCKS AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE FUNDS ARE NOT BUDGETED AS PART OF TRANSPORTATION. IS ACTUALLY INCLUDED AS PART OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROPOSALS FOR CALLIE P. A. IN ENERGY COMMISSION. BUT I WANTED TO BRING IT UP HERE BECAUSE THERE IS OF COURSE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRANSPORTATION. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY VERY BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE MAY REVISION A TO TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL- THERE ARE REPRESENTATIVES HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND OF COURSE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CORRECT- WELL THE L. A. O. ONE TWO. IS THAT MR MENACE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ON UNITS GROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THERE THE PROPOSED THAT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TRANSPORTATION SPENDING AND MOST OF THE FUNDING CONSISTS OF ONE TIME AUGMENTATION TO EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS- AND THE CHANT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND VARIOUS OTHER AT THE AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS- AND GENERALLY. WE THINK THE KEY QUESTION A REVIEWING THIS PACKAGE IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE THINGS TO INCREASE FUNDING ALINES THAT THE BROADER BUDGETARY PRIORITIES EITHER WITHIN TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. AND FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S DEDICATING A BILLION DOLLARS TO PROJECTS ACCORDING TO LA OLYMPICS ARE HAPPEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ALLIANCE WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. AND THAT CONCLUDES. OUR COMMENTS RAPID THINK ANY QUESTIONS. YES WE WANT MONEY FOR THE OLYMPICS. SORRY COULDN'T RESIST. OKAY DOES ANYONE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANT TO COMMENT. AND POLITICS PARTNER FINANCES WOULD JUST NOTE THE IMPORTANCE WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT IT WILL CREATE JOBS- EXCEL OR TRANSPORTATION CONNECTIVITY ACROSS THE STATE HELPS THE STATE ACHIEVE CLIMATE GOALS AND HELP THE STATE OF LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL DOLLARS. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES CENTER NEWMAN THANK YOU MEASURE AND QUICK QUESTION FOR MR CORRECT A REGARDING THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING- I KNOW THERE WAS THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS IN A ACTUALLY THE PAST TO SEE TO SEE MEETINGS ABOUT INCREASING THE INCREMENTAL VARIABLE FOR THE EIGHTY P. PROJECTS AND SO IT APPEARS THAT THE FIREMEN THAT THERE'S BEEN NO CHANGE- IS THAT CORRECT. I'M NOT CHANGING IN IN WHAT EXACTLY I'M SORRY I I'M SORRY SHOULD BE CLEARED SO THAT THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION MADE BY. I THINK THROUGH THE CDC TO ASK FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS. YES INSTEAD OF THE I THINK THE REASON PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED SO THIS FIVE HUNDRED IS NOT AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED IT'S THE ORIGINAL FIVE HUNDRED CORRECT- SO IF I CAN SENATOR THIS THE- PROPOSAL WAS MADE AFTER. THE C. D. C. INITIALLY PROPOSED A TWO BILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO THE PROGRAM- SO IT. IT'S NOT AND IT. ADDITIONAL DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S THIS IS A NEW PROPOSAL- THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE PROGRAM IS TWO HUNDRED AND I WANT TO SAY AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THIS IS- TWO YEARS WORTH OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN IN ONE AT ONE TIME FUNDING- WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT WILL HELP. OF THE VERY HIGHEST SCORING PROJECTS THAT JUST WEREN'T ABLE TO RECEIVE FUNDING IN THIS LAST ROUND. AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY- IN FACT AT THE MOMENT THERE ARE THERE ARE- I THINK THE TOTAL APPLICATIONS FOR. THE LAST ROUND OF ATP WEREN'T EVEN THAT HOT. NO I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST TRYING MY FEDERAL W. ON WHERE WE WELL UP IT WHERE ONE OF SO I THINK YOU MADE IT CLEAR SO IT SHOWED THIS IS. THIS IS MORE THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED WHEN THE BUDGET PROCESS STARTED. BUT IT'S BUT IT'S IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WAS PROPOSED BY THE CDC SO THAT THAT'S THE NUMBER FIVE HUNDRED RIGHT. YES I COOK I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR- SENATE QUARTERS THE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. NO THE ONLY ONE I HAD WAS THE ONE THAT WAS JUST SO AS WE CENTER NEWMAN THANK YOU. GREAT I'M I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. ONE IS HOW. HOW CAN WE BE SURE WOULD WHAT KIND OF. GUARANTEES ARE THERE IN ALL OF THIS- IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE PURPOSE OF IT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE EFFORTS- I AGREE WITH THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. HOWEVER I'M ASKING IS WHAT ARE THE WORK FORCE STANDARDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF. ANY YOU KNOW PROPOSED- ARE JOB CREATION- THAT ANYONE MIGHT BE COMMITTED. TO SO I MIGHT AS YOU HAVE ANYONE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A BETTER CALCULATION THE NIGHT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- THESE KINDS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. WE ARE TALKING AT THIRTEEN THOUSAND JOBS CREATED FOR EACH BILLION DOLLAR INVESTED AT THAT'S FOR HIGHWAYS WHICH OF COURSE IS WHAT I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH- THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT NUMBERS- RELATED TO RAIL AND TRANSIT- BUT THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT- JOB CREATIONS AND THOSE ARE DIRECT NUMBERS IT DOES NOT INCLUDE SOMETIMES YOU'LL HEAR FOLKS MIGHT TALK ABOUT JOB CREATIONS. ABOUT THIS TRICKLE DOWN OF ALL THE DIFFERENT- OF DIFFERENT LEVELS BUT- IT'S THIRTEEN THOUSAND IS THE JET THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED NUMBER THAT WE USE FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION. I MIGHT MIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWER- I WOULD TAKE IT I'M ASKING TO GO A STEP FURTHER WHICH IS NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF JOBS. BUT THE ACTUAL WORKFORCE STANDARDS THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS- AND- IN THE FIRST STEP IS THE NUMBER BUT THE SECOND STEP IS WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AS FAR AS REQUIRING. ALL WORKFORCE STANDARDS AND- IF WE DON'T WATCH OUT FOR THAT I GUARANTEE YOU THERE WILL BE MANY MANY OF THOSE JOBS MANY THOUSANDS OF THOSE JOBS WILL BE SUBCONTRACTED OUT. AND WILL END UP- YOU KNOW LOW WAGE LOW PAID SOMETIMES EVEN WAGE THEFT JOBS SO THAT'S MY THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT ARE THE WORK FORCE STANDARDS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY THEN I REALLY- JUST WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THIS IS. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY SO BILL THE STANDARDS THE WORKFORCE STANDARDS QUALITY OF THE JOBS- ALSO. REACHING OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES- THAT USUALLY DON'T GET THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD OF COMMITTEES OF COLOR WOMEN. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- THAT'S THE SECOND ISSUE- AND- JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE BUT IT- VERY SPECIFIC- SORT OF THING THAT- I HOPE THAT WE COULD ADDRESS. AND THAT IS- AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES THERE ARE MANY GRADES TRUCK DRIVERS WERE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THEY HAVE TO SHOULDER THE COST OF ELECTRIFICATION SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS FUNDING. ENSURES THAT THOSE MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS ARE NOT BEARING THE FULL COST OF THE ELECTRIFICATION SO THAT'S A SPECIFIC QUESTION BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE AT THE SAME TIME. OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF WE ARE NOT INTENTIONAL DELIBERATE AND EXPLICIT WHAT WE EXPECT TO COME OUT OF. SUCH AN A GREAT- MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SENATOR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF- ANYONE AT THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT GIVEN YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE- ELECTRIC VEHICLES THANK YOU. YES MATT I'M SURE THIS IS CHAD ADDISON FROM CALLOUSED YANG I FOCUS A LOT ON THE RAIL AND TRANSIT PROGRAMS AND SPECIFICALLY IN THE TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM. I'M ART THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS BUT A PRIORITY ON THE TYPES OF THAT CONCERNS THAT YOU JUST RAISED. SO WE HAVE BOTH DONE SELECTION CRITERIA THAT FOCUSED ON AGENCIES THAT APPLY BRINGING IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. AS% SOMETHING TO HIGHLIGHT AND THEY ALSO GIVE PRIORITY TO. A WORKFORCE WORKFORCE STAFF FOCUS ON ON THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR ORDERED PROJECTS INCLUDES ATTENTION TO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS BUT WE DEFINITELY. I TAKE TO HEART YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. OKAY. OKAY I JUST WANNA INVITE- SERINA A STORY OF WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN LOS ANGELES- A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN THERE WAS FUNDING THAT WE CREATED THROUGH AN INCREASE OFFER A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AN INCREASE IN OUR SALES TAX AND THE BECAUSE WE INSISTED ON. VERY SPECIFIC LEE LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE GOING TO CREATE JOBS IN THE AREA AND THAT WE ENDED UP BECAUSE OF THE DELIBERATE NATURE OF OUR EXPECTATIONS A WE ENDED UP WITH ONE BRAND NEW FACTORY. ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY FACTORY OFFER THE TRAINS AND THEN ELECTRIC- BUS FACTORY WAS ALSO BUILT AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM HAVE I DON'T KNOW OVER A THOUSAND PLUS WORKERS SO I THINK THIS IS THE THIS IS WHAT I'M- YOU KNOW I HAVE IN MY MIND. THAT WE CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH THIS ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAN WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY HAVE DONE SO. CHECK THANK YOU EVERYONE- THAT'S A- HOLDEN OPEN APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK THANK YOU EVERYBODY WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA PACKAGE. THIS ITEM- I'D LIKE TO HAND OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE HEART ALSO FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU STEVE AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ON THE HEART WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL WITH YOU ALL. TO MAKE THE PROPOSAL A REALITY HOW TRAINS ARE FIVE THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM GENERAL FUND INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE POSITION. FOR THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. I MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR FOR YOUR CALTRANS HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. OUR INVESTMENT IN TRASH REDUCTION ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. AND MEANWHILE OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE HAS CONTINUED TO DECREASE DECREASE ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS. WHILE CALTRANS AND ALL OF THE PARTNERS THAT WE WORK IN CONTACT WITH I THINK YOU NEED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES. IN THE BAFFERT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT PRODUCTION OF TRASH THAT'S ENTERING THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM AND FRANKLY OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. IF IT'S COMING IN AS A LATE AT ANY RATE THAT WERE UNABLE. TO MEET WITH EXISTING RESOURCES. THE PROPOSAL THAT YOUR SO HIM THAT THAT NOT THEM ASK FOR. RESOURCES YOU CONTINUE TO PICK UP TRASH FROM ROADSIDE NOT CERTAINLY ONE PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. BUT WHAT THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ACCOMPLISH IS REALLY A RADICAL SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT CALTRANS. OUR PARTNERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC SPACES ACROSS THE STATE. I'M ON THE STATE AND THE LOCAL SYSTEM THAT PROPOSAL WILL MAKE LASTING IMPROVEMENTS THAT EXTEND FAR BEYOND. THE THREE YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM I'M A HUGE COMPONENT OF THIS PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO TAKE EXISTING FACE. AND MAKE IT A PART OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRUCIAL IN THIS EFFORT. THROUGHOUT THIS PROPOSAL THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOT JUST LETTER ABATEMENT AND TRASH YOUR EDUCATION. BUT ALSO IMPROVEMENTS BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS THAT INCORPORATE ART INSTALLATION. I THAT WILL BE A IN IT HOPEFULLY INCORPORATED BY ARTISTS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. WHAT WE FOUND IS PEOPLE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THE PUBLIC FACES THAT WE HAVE A LONGER FREEWAYS ROADWAYS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THEM AND THEY'RE OUT. I'M THROUGH THE PROPOSAL WE REALLY SPEAK TO DEVELOP. AND A NEW WAY OF A CALIFORNIANS. LOOKING AT. THE PAPER THAT THEY- AND THE ROAD AND FREEWAYS THAT U. AND FOR THE PROPOSAL WE THAT OUR- IS. I STARTED NEED. I PUBLIC. ARE THEIR OWN. YOUR POINT THIS FOR. ALSO WILL DELIVER. THOUSAND YOU AND HELP ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE HUGE PART OF THE PROPOSAL IS INCREASING CALTRANS EXISTING PARTNERSHIP. WITH EMPLOYMENT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES. IMPORTANT SOCIAL ENTERPRISES ARE REALLY INCREDIBLE IN THEIR MISSION TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO WORK. INCLUDING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. VETERANS ARE AT RISK YOUTH. I CALTRAIN WORKED THESE GROUPS BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOPEFULLY INCREASE OUR REACH. AND DEVELOP REALLY AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT HAVE TO WEAR A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. I CANNOT POINT WE HAVE ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT CREATE WELFARE YOUR MEAT AND- COMPLICATION JOB WITHIN CALTRANS. THAT ARE NOT A JOB THAT REALLY CAREERS- WE HAVE HAD PEOPLE WHO HAVE STARTED IN THE JOB WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT FOR NOW EXECUTIVES THAT CALTRANS. RIGHT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND MOBILITY AND THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS. THERE WOULD ALSO BE SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE TO ALL THESE FOLKS AND YOU CHIU AND. FOUR YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ANOTHER ON OF THE PROPOSED IS THE IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS. ON TRIBAL LANDS AND TRANSIT CENTERS AND THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THROUGH THAT THAT INVESTMENT. NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE DOLLARS WILL GO DIRECTLY TO LOCAL. AND THAT'LL BE FOR BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT LETTER ABATEMENT I'M ON LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS THAT TRANSIT AGENCIES ON TRIBAL LANDS. AND AGAIN WITHOUT CONCEPT OF. NOT JUST CONTINUING TO PICK UP TRASH ONCE IT'S ON THE ROADWAY BUT REALLY COMING TOGETHER OUT COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. YOU TO STOP TRUMP'S BEFORE IT GETS THERE IN TO GET EVERYONE INVOLVED IN IN TRANSFORMING OUR PUBLIC SPACES. INTO PLACES THAT WE CAN ALL TAKE PRIDE IN. AND THAT WE ARE TREATED BETTER. I FINALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AND WE WOULD ALSO HAVE A COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL TO BE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. WHERE WE WORK WITH STUDENTS AND PULLED ACROSS THE STATE AND ALSO JUST WORKED. AND I CAN KIND OF CHANGE THE TONE IN TURN IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT OUR SYSTEM IN OUR STATE. I'LL REITERATE THAT I OFTEN HEAR THAT IT SEEMS THAT THE CALTRANS IS NOT. I'M YOU KNOW COLLECTING TRASH FROM ROADWAYS AND CERTAINLY THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW US TO COLLECT TRASH FROM ROADWAYS. ESPECIALLY AND URBAN AREAS BUT ALSO ON EVERY STATE ROUTE FRANKLY IN THE STATE. I WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT MORE TRASH AT A GREATER FREQUENCY. I CAN TELL YOU I'VE BEEN OUT WITH OUR MAINTENANCE CREWS ON REQUESTED TRASH FROM ROADWAYS. AND OFTENTIMES AND THERE ARE AREAS WHERE IT'S SO BAD THAT OUR CREWS ARE GETTING HIT WITH TRASH I'M LOOKING IT UP. AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF PHOTOS THAT DEMONSTRATE AND OFTENTIMES SEVENTY TWO HOURS AFTER WE COMPLETELY CLEAN THE LOCATION. TRANSACTION THREE ACCUMULATED AND NOT LOCATION AND IT LOOKED AS IF CALTRANS WAS NEVER THERE. SO THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL IT'S REALLY THE IDEA OF BRINGING OUR COMMUNITY TOGETHER. INCREASING OUR CALTRAIN FORCES INCREASING OUR PARTNERSHIP. AND WHICH IS WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO. PROVIDE JOBS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO WORK. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BREAK INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THEIR LIVES. AND THEN AGAIN WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS. THE LOCAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU THERE WITH FACT. ARE IF THEY'RE ANY FOR. THANK YOU MAY HART. THE I AM VERY ABOUT THIS- OF PROGRAMMING I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION BUT WILL- START WITH THE- L. A. O. ANY COMMENTS. YES FRANK JIMENEZ AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WAY THIS PROPOSAL AGAINST ITS OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. ARE GIVEN THE INCREASE IN TRASH ON STATE HIGHWAYS AND LOCAL ROADS WE FIND IT REASONABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDING. FOR STATE AND LOCAL- BUT OUR BASEMENT EFFORTS. IN LOOKING AT THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK THE KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER BEAUTIFICATION ARE PROJECTS ON HIGHWAYS AND ROADS. ARE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE ISM PRIORITIES. OR AND WHETHER THERE ARE HIGHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES I'M ALSO WITHIN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND JUST IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING UNTIL. THANK YOU MISTER JIMENEZ- ANYONE FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE. JAMES MORE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST LIKE THATTHAT WE CAN KERR WITH THE PROPOSAL WHICH WILL ALLOW CALTRANS TO INCREASE ITS LITTER ABATEMENT EFFORTS AND ALSO ESTABLISHED NEW PROGRAMS THAT WILL. REDUCE LITTERING THE FUTURE AS WELL AS WAS MENTIONED PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR BEAUTIFICATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THANK YOU- I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION. OUR PROBLEM IS HEART. IS HOW WILL THE MONEY BE DIVIDED SINCE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS- ENORMOUS NEED- ALL OVER THE STATE- RIGHT I'VE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW IT'S EITHER DONE BY POPULATION- LANE MILES BUT HOW ABOUT. COURAGE OF TRASH- NOT BE A CONSIDERATION IN- DECIDING WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE SPENT. ABSOLUTELY ON OUR STATE THAT TIME WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT ART WHAT WE COLOR SIGNIFICANT TRASH GENERATING AREA. THAT WE WOULD BE INCREASING RHETORIC THE REVOCATION DEFINITELY IN THE AREAS WHERE WE PUT THAT WE IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT CASH GENERATING AREAS. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST EQUAL BUT THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A FOCUS ON THE STATE BANKFOR THE LITTER ABATEMENT PROPHETICALLY. ADD FOR THE BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS AND I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT WE EXPECT THOSE TO BE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL I'M NOT JEFF AND GREAT TO LOOK AT BUT ALSO TO SERVE A PURPOSE IN TERMS OF. A WOMEN NEEDING A LEGAL ABOUT PAYING FOR PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM IRAN FROM TRASHING. THERE'S CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEM WERE TRASHED IT TENDS TO COLLECT. THAT WE INTEND EVERY AFTER EVERY BEAUTIFICATION AND EVEN A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS TO HAVE A FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT AS WELL. ON THE LOCAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF WHERE THE DOLLARS WILL GO I DON'T CERTAINLY BE A FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND CALTRANS DEVELOPING A LOCAL LOCAL PROGRAM AND REALLY. TRY TO GET A LOCAL MATCH PROGRAM THAT WILL BE DETERMINED BETWEEN ZERO AND 50% MATCH- BASED ON THE COPY OF THE COMMUNITY. TO LEVERAGE LOCAL CAPITAL. THANK YOU. OF I JUST STEP I JUST WANNA TAKE UP TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'VE ALREADY INSPIRED EVEN IF THIS HASN'T BEEN APPROVED YOU ALREADY INSPIRED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES IN THE AREA PART OF MY DISTRICT- HOLLYWOOD A DISTRICT BUSINESSES THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO PARTNERING UP AND PUTTING THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVEN MORE- ALONG THESE LINES SO APPRECIATE THE- THE WORK YOU PUT INTO THIS- ANYBODY WOULD HAVE. SENATOR CORTESE ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS YOU KNOW THANKS. THANKS MADAM CHAIR WORST YOU'RE STILL ON THE CLEAN CALIFORNIA PACKAGE RIGHT YES. C. O. C. BASIS HERE- SO MS HIS HEART BUT ANYWAY I. TO THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT- YOU KNOW I'M I'M INTERESTED- A LITTLE MORE INTERESTED IN THE DETAILS OF HOW THINGS ARE YOUR PLAN ROLL OUT SPECIAL INTERESTS LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS AND- I HAPPEN TO BE. CHATTING WITH THE DIRECTOR RECENTLY IN FRONT OF ME SOME FORESHADOWING OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT- WE'VE WE'VE HAD IN MY HOME DISTRICTS ARE COUNTY SOME. GOOD SUCCESS IN THE PAST PUTTING TOGETHER PARTNERSHIPS- YOU KNOW THAT INVOLVES CONSERVATION CORPS FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY THE CITY AND IN CALTRANS YOU KNOW ON AN AMMO YOU AND- SURE IT WAS A HUGE. RELIEF TO LOCAL CONSTITUENTS TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR. YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM OR THAT'S YOU KNOW DON'T DON'T CALL THE COUNTY OR DON'T CALL NOW THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM US DON'T CALL US CALL WOULD BE GREAT SO. BASICALLY PEOPLE JUST SEE IT AS GOVERNMENT'S ISSUE IT WE DON'T REALLY CARE. WHO HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH IT SO I I'D LIKE THE IDEA OF THE PARTNERSHIPS ALSO LIKE THE IDEA OF A RICH BECAUSE- ASSUMING IT DOESN'T GET. YOU KNOW INTO A BIG ISSUE IN TERMS OF. WORKFORCE COOPERATION- YOU'RE CERTAINLY WE'VE BEEN AWARE IN IN BIGGER MECHANICS AND- SEVENS AND PERSISTENCE OF THE MAINTENANCE CREWS ARE JUST SPREAD VERY VERY THIN. RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S OUT THERE. IN THE PANDEMIC'S EXACERBATED THAT BECAUSE- OF- YOU KNOW RESTORE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS ON- ON ON HOW MUCH- CAN BE DONE IN TERMS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. OF MOVING PEOPLE AROUND DURING PANDEMIC SO FOR SO IT'S ALL BECOME KIND OF THE PERFECT STORM- BUT I'M JUST LOOKING FOR MAYBE SOME OFFLINE NO I DON'T IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IT'S BEEN A LONG MEETING AND ON- SB CANDID- YOU COULD PROBABLY GIVE US A VERY GOOD BUT LATELY YOU KNOW EXPLANATION OF HOW SOME THAT MIGHT WORK BUT IF WE COULD NOT GET TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO OUR OFFICE IS JUST A LITTLE MORE DETAIL OUTLINED IN TERMS OF. HOW THINGS ARE RIGHT THE ROLL OUT- COUNTY BY COUNTY. CONFORMANCE TO BE MISS UNITED. YOU GET SOME TO GET THIS MONEY S. ESSENCE PUSH DOWN TO GET GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY OR POPULATION EQUITY OR WHATEVER'S GOING TO HAPPEN INTERCHANGEABLE B. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA WORK ALL THAT OUT BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF CURIOSITY ABOUT THAT AND I THINK. WHEN WE GET DOWN TO WORK OUR DISTRICT OPERATIONS THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER FOLKS THAT FRANKLY CARE MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE IN A LOT OF CASES MEDIA ABOUT THE BIG ISSUES LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLIMATE AND- IN PRISON REFORM I MEAN THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW'S THIS GONNA GET CLEANED UP SO AGAIN I'M ALL FOR IT- IT WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME MORE DETAIL- SOONER YOU KNOW SINCE WE CAN'T. THANK YOU FOR HAVING PROVIDED. MORE DETAIL IN WRITING I JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHAT YOU'VE SHARED AT THE DOCKET APPEARED AT THE PROPOSED BALL I'M REALLY TRYING TO BREAK DOWN BUREAUCRACY. BRING TOGETHER PARTNERSHIPS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT STATE GOVERNMENT MAKE THINGS A LOT EASIER FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. I'M AND DOWN TOGETHER AND TRYING TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE BEAUTIFUL PLACE- AND THE PARTNERSHIP GO ALL THE WAY FROM. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TO THE STATE CONSERVATION CORPS THAN ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT WE WORK. WITH I WILL CERTAINLY GET YOU IN MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU KNOW THAT WOULD JUST SAY I'M SORRY THE BILL. BUT- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES AGREE WITH ME ON THIS- THE SOONER WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S BEING OFFERED ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT MATCHES THAT MIGHT. ENTICED TO THIS- THE OONER THE BETTER BECAUSE AS THEY'RE ON THE SAME CYCLE IS US IN A I THINK I KNOW I WOULD- I'M GUESSING MIKE TO CALL CENTER HERE TODAY ON THIS COMMITTEE WOULD ALSO DO THE SAME THING. IS A WORD FOR LOCALS TO BE NOT ONLY AWARE OF THIS BUT TO START THINKING ABOUT FACTORY DIçN- SOME SOME SOME KIND OF A COLLABORATIVE MATTRESS SOME KIND OF MONEY IN THEIR BUDGETS TO BE PREPARED. NOT TO LEVERAGE WELL WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING HERE- IF THEY GET THERE THE SAME AS US IF THEY WAIT TOO LONG TO GET BE ON JULY FIRST- THEY'RE KIND OF- IT'S LIKE FREEZE TAG YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR. YOU KNOW TO PARTICIPATE IN MANY CASES SO- SO WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN OUR COUNTY AND- TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN ENCOURAGE THE OTHER WEBSITE OF OFFICES TO DO THAT I THINK IT WOULD BE WOULD BE SMART. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER COURTESY- THIS IS A WILL HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN- AND WE MOVE ON TO WE HAVE TO MORE ITEMS- I JUST WANT TO. LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT WE HAVE UNTIL SIX PM AND THE- WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT YET TO DO SO- NEXUS ISSUE TEN- OF PROPOSITION. ONE A. AUTHORITY. CLOSED GONNA HAVE. YEAH MADAM AND- MY BY AND I'M THE CHIEF. OFFICER AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. I'M GOING TO PRESENT THE MAY REVISION REQUEST TO APPROPRIATE PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS FOR THE PROJECT. THE AUTHORITY IS FOLLOWING THE PROCESS SPECIFIED IN THE VOTER APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE A BOND ACT FOR APPROPRIATIONS. WHICH INCLUDE SUBMITTING A FUNDING PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO FORMALLY REQUESTING THE APPROPRIATIONS. THE FUNDING PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH AND NOW THE MAY REVISION FORMALLY REQUEST THE APPROPRIATIONS. BASED ON THE FUNDING PLAN SUBMITTED IN FEBRUARY THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE HELD A JOINT HEARING ON MARCH SIXTEENTH THERE REVIEW THE FUNDING PLAN. THE MAY REVISION BUDGET REQUEST IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS OUTLINED OF THE FUNDING PLAN. AND AT THE MARCH HEARING. THE AUTHORITY IS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND PROPOSITION ONE DAY FUNDS TO COMPLETE WORK ON THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT FROM MADERA TO POPLAR AVENUE WHICH IS NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROP ONE A. FUNDING WARM SIR ENSURE SUFFICIENT CASH FOR THE PROJECT AS REMAINING FEDERAL FUNDS CANNOT BE EXPANDED YET AND CAP AND TRADE FUNDS WILL BE RECEIVED OVERTIME. THIS APPROPRIATION IS NEEDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WITHOUT T WE PROJECT WE WILL RUN OUT OF MONEY IN EARLY CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IF CASH FLOW FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK IS INSUFFICIENT WORK WOULD HAVE TO BE SLOWED AND WORKERS LAID OFF. AT THE MARCH HEARING THE AUTHORITY OUTLINED PROGRESS ON CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES COMPLETED OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION HAS TRIPLED FROM NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN. AND WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO MILES OF GUIDE WAY. UNDER A COMPLETE OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION NOW. WITH THE PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS REQUESTED HERE WE CAN COMPLETE THAT WORK. SECOND THE AUTHORITY IS REQUESTING ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS TO SUPPORT PLANNING PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. FOR THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM THE SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES ANAHEIM SEGMENT. FINALIZING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ON PHASE ONE SEGMENTS WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WISSAM COMPLETING THIS CALENDAR YEAR OTHERS AND TWENTY TWO AND- EARLY TWENTY THREE. A THIRD THE AUTHORITY IS REQUESTING TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IN STATE OPERATIONS AUGMENTATIONS IN FIFTY SIX POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THIS WORK. SINCE THE JOINT HEARING IN MARCH THE BOARD ADOPTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE THE FINAL TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. THAT PLAN OUTLINES NEXT STEPS TO GET HIGH SPEED RAIL PASSENGER SERVICE UP AND RUNNING BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD BY THE END OF THE DECADE AS THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK OF THE STATEWIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. I WITH THE MAY REVISION. OF THE AUTHORITIES PROPOSITION ONE A APPROPRIATION IS PART NOW OF THE LARGER TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE WHICH MISTER CAPTAIN OTHER SPOKE UP. FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN IN THESE OTHER TRANSPORTATION AREAS WE THINK THESE STATE MONIES WERE POSITION CALIFORNIA TO BE WE HOPE FIRST IN LINE. FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE NOW BEING DISCUSSED BY THE BY DEMONSTRATION AND ALSO THE U. S. CONGRESS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE'RE GOOD THANK YOU MISTER LEWIS. FROM THE L. A. O. ANY COMMENTS. UNDERESTIMATE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SO OUR HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH THE COMMITTEE IN MARCH SO COVER THEM PRETTY QUICKLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I KNOW OF THE HOUR IS LATE. IN SUMMARY WE THINK THESE PROPOSALS REPRESENT A KEY DECISION POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO THIS PROJECT WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TWO MAIN THINGS AS IT MAKES DECISIONS ON THESE PROPOSALS. IS ITS LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE AVAILABLE FUNDING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT. THE AUTHORITY EXPECTED EXISTING FUNDING WILL BE ROUGHLY SUFFICIENT THAT WE KNOW THAT THE PROJECT HAS HAD A HISTORY OF INCREASES IN COSTS. SECOND WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ITS COMMITMENT TO FULLY FUNDING THE PROJECT. THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO MEETING A FUNDING GAP OF ANY THAT COULD EMERGE YOU CONSTRUCTING THE PERCENTAGE BAKERSFIELD THANK MIGHT AS WELL AS ITS COMMITMENT TO FINDING FUTURE SEGMENTS. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS COMMITTED TO FINDING MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD EVEN IF THE FUNDING GAP EMERGES AND IS ALSO COMMITTED TO FINDING FUTURE PROJECT SEGMENTS THEN WE THINK THE AUTHORITIES GENERAL APPROACH IS REASONABLE. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT PREPARED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FUNDING WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD AND FUTURE STATEMENTS AT THIS TIME. IT COULD PROVIDE SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVE DIRECTION SUCH AS THREE BUDGET OR TRAILER BILLING LANGUAGE. AND OR DELAY ACTION ON SOME OR ALL OF THE APPROPRIATION REQUEST TO LATER IN THE SUMMER OR EVEN TOLD THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. WE NOTE THAT DELAYING ACTION COULD PROVIDE MORE TIME FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE- IN FOR THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. AND ALSO PRESERVE AND NATURAL LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING POINT. TO BE NOTED THAT IN ADDITION TO THESE BIG PICTURE CONSIDERATIONS WE JUST OUTLINED OUT WE DO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THEY WERE STILL WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY ON ON THAT PARTICULAR FREE SUPPORT. PROPOSAL AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM ON THIS ON THIS QUESTION. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CHRISTY- THE L. A. O. ANY COME. I DON'T KNOW SORRY THE SLATE OKAY WITH OF DOES THE- DETERMINE FINANCE SORRY. READ ACCOUNTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL AND WOULD KNOW THAT IT IS A CONSISTENT WITH THE BUSINESS PLAN THEN A FUNDING PLAN. AS RENDON INSTEAD INDICATED WAS RELEASED BACK FEBRUARY- WE DO BELIEVE THE SONS OF THESE PATIENTS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR CENTRAL VALLEY STUDY FROM GEORGE. THANK YOU. OKAY. SENATE CRITICIZING ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO THANK YOU MANAGER. OKAY I THINK THAT DOES IT THEN- WE'RE LEAVING THIS OPEN AND MOVING ON THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- ISSUE ELEVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS TIME AND THE CLOSING POSITION WITH ALL OF YOU- I AM KATHLEEN WHAT CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO TRANSFORM INTO AN EFFICIENT MOBILE AND CUSTOMER CENTRIC OR ORGANIZATION IN EFFORT TO BRING OUR SERVICES TO EVERYONE ANYWHERE.

EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED EXPANDED KIOSK DEPLOYMENT LAUNCHING A REDESIGNED RESPONSIVE WEBSITE ADDING THE ABILITY TO ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS IN OUR FIELD OFFICES AND EMPLOYING- IMPROVING UP WEIGHT TRAINING TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES PROPOSALS TO CONTINUE THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND IT'S CHANGING CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC AND THE CHANGING FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR A NEW MOBILE IDENTITY PROGRAM I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO LEAST THOUGHT PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW.

THE POINTS I WANT TO MAKERS ABOUT EIGHT ITEMS THAT WILL GO THROUGH ALL ALL TRY TO KEEP THE HIGH LEVEL AS I KNOW THAT WE'RE AT THE END OF THE DAY. ARE THE FIRST ONE ON DRESSES THE RELY THE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS- THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS BASICALLY THE SAME FROM WHEN WE SUBMIT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ARE WE JUST WANTED ANOTHER WE'RE GONNA PROPOSED TO SHIFT FOUR HUNDRED NINE MILLION OVER FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING A BUDGET YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT TO THE GENERAL FUND. HI THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST OUR WORKFORCE EXPENDITURES. LOOK AT OUR CHANGES TO PASSED THE REAL ID. I'LL BE STILL EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT TRANSACTION EASIER WHETHER YOU CAN DO IT FROM HOME WHEN YOU'RE UPLOADING YOUR DOCUMENTS FIRST- GETTING A PRE APPROVED SO THAT WHEN YOU CAN- GET A CONFIRMATION TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE BUILDING. A READY TO GO INTO A FIELD OFFICE. WITH AN APPOINTMENT- WE HAVE ALSO. TO PROVIDE ABOUT POINT MILLION. UNIQUE REAL ID SO FAR WE NEED TO PROD.

WE CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT AN AGGRESSIVE MARKETING PLAN STARTING IN BUDGET HERE- AND AS WE OP THAT WE WILL SHOW OUR- CUSTOMERS AS WELL. THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO NECESSARY PROVIDER SO SECURITY CARD. ANYMORE THEY CAN JUST PROVIDE THE NUMBER AND WE WILL CHECK IT FOR YOU. AS THE- THIS PROPOSAL- IT IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WE'RE JUST GONNA LET YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND. BUT THE NEXT PROPOSAL THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AS THE DIGITAL ACCELERATION FACILITIES AND TALENT ACQUISITION- GIVE HE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE SERVICE SERVICES TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. THIS IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW OFFERINGS OF WEB AND MOBILE OPTIONS. ARE WE WORK CONTINUED OPENING UP OUR CHANNELS THE DIFFERENCE SERVICE CHANNELS MORE WAYS TO GO DIGITAL.

STATE TO STATE IS BASICALLY WHAT THE REAL IDEA ACTORS REQUIRING US TO IMPLEMENT THIS. AND WHAT WE WILL CHECK WITH ALL OTHER STATES TO DETERMINE IF THE APPLICANT CURRENTLY HOLDS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR REAL ID CARD ANOTHER STATE. SO IT'S BEEN PRETTY HIGH LEVEL THE IDEA IS THAT. IF I GO TO FLORIDA AND I TRY TO APPLY FOR A REAL ID. OF FLORIDA WOULD THEN COMMUNICATE WITH CALIFORNIA AND TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY TO USE UP THEIR- ARM. AT THE STATE OF RECEIVE THAT CONFIRMATION- IN ANOTHER STATE OR POSSESSES A REAL ID CARD IN ANOTHER STATE. OF THE RECEIVING STATE MUST TAKE MEASURES TO CONFIRM THAT THE PERSON HAS TERMINATED OR IS TERMINATING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR- ID CARD.
