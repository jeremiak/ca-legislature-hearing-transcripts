I PRESENT TO YOU EIGHTY NINE THE SHARE ACT THE STOP HARASSMENT AND REPORTING EXTENSION ACT WHICH EXTENDS OF TIME FOR FILING HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA. FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. CURRENTLY HARASSMENT VICTIMS FILE THE CLAIM WITHIN ONE YEAR OR THE FACE AN ABSOLUTE TIME BAR AND WILL BE UNABLE TO SEEK ADMINISTRATIVE OR CIVIL REDRESS IN COURT. THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THIS FILING PERIOD FROM ONE YEAR TO THREE YEARS ALLOWING VICTIMS ADDITIONAL TIME TO SEEK THIS REDRESS AND MAKING IT MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE FILING TIME LIMITS FOR OTHER ACTIONS LEGISLATURE LIKE. LIKE MANY INDUSTRIES HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THE CHANGES IN THE WAKE OF THE ME TO MOVEMENT PARTICULARLY AFTER THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A MEMBERS OF OUR OWN BODY. HOWEVER THESE ISSUES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE HALLS OF GOVERNMENT. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MOST CLAIMS OF INJURY HAVE LONGER FILING PERIODS AND FILING DEADLINES FOR EXAMPLE THE TIME TO FILE AN ACTION FOR PERSONAL INJURY IS TWO YEARS. FOR FRAUD THREE YEARS IN FOR CONTRACT DISPUTES FOUR YEAR TIME LIMIT. AB NINE IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK REDRESS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS JESSICA STANDER SENIOR COUNSEL WITH EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND JACKIE SERRANO LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN IT SHOWS SO THAT WE ARE CLEAR -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN COMMENTS SIX ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX CORRECT VERY GOOD THANK YOU. TWO MINUTES PLEASE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA STENDER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND SAN FRANCISCO PROUD BECAUSE SPONSOR OF AB. NINE FOR OVER FORTY YEARS WE REPRESENT AND HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION. VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT FACE MARRIED OBSTACLES THE COMING FORWARD MANY OF THEM FEAR RETALIATION -- ESPECIALLY FROM THE HARASSER HIMSELF OR HERSELF AND THE EMPLOYER I. AND SOMETIMES THAT THOSE FORMS RETALIATION CAN EVEN RESULT IN JOB LOSS. OTHERS OFTEN DON'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE THE TRAUMA OF WHAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED AND THESE FEARS ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE OFTEN UNAWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS -- AND AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM IS ILLEGAL -- MANY DON'T SPEAK OUT RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE OF THESE FEARS AND BY THE TIME THEY FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM IS ILLEGAL THEY'RE VERY SHORT ONE YOU'RE SUCH A LIMITATION HAS TOLD AND THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO BRING ANY CLAIM. MANY WORKERS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND NOT N A VACUUM THE EXPERIENCE OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AS WELL AN INTERSECTIONAL DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN IS VERY COMMON. AND THUS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS TIME MIGHT BE EXTENDED FOR ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION THAT ARE PROHIBITED UNDER OUR FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT. HARASSMENT IS AN INSIDIOUS HARM THAT DENIES EMPLOYEES AN EQUITABLE WORKPLACE VICTIMS OF TIME TO FILE THEIR CLAIMS WITH THE D. AT THE AGE THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH OTHER TYPES OF CIVIL ACTIONS ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE BARRIERS THAT MANY WORKERS FACE. AND A PARTICULAR PRONOUNCE BARRIERS THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS FACE FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY WITH REQUEST RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JACQUI STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO ONE OF THE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. AB NINE WILL GIVE VICTIMS MORE TIME TO BRING THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS UNDER THE FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. THE CULTURAL RECKONING OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAS MADE MANY VICTIMS AWARE THAT THEY HAD RIGHTS THAT WERE NOT ONLY BEING VIOLATED BUT THAT THERE WAS A SOCIETAL NEED TO CORRECT THE HARMS. TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING TO OTHERS. SILENCE AROUND DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IS FINALLY BEING BROKEN AND PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE AN AVENUE TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS. THE ONE YEAR DEADLINE WAS SET IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE WE THINK IT'S TIME TO BE MODERNIZED TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF OUR MODERN STATE. GIVING VICTIMS MORE TIME THE FATHER CLAIMS WILL ALLOW THEM TO HOLD PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF FOOD STEP FORWARD NAME AND AFFILIATION. I'M SURE MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

MARTY MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THAT HAVE BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WERE -- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON THIS BILL WE DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT THE AUTHOR HAS GENERATED BOTH LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR. REGARDING THE ME TO MOVE IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS AND I THINK IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT. VICTIMS NEEDING MORE TIME TO COME FORWARD -- IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT WE DO. HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL WITH US FOR TWO AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION -- THE FIRST IS. WE BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CONVERSATION -- AND THE UNIQUE NATURE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS. IT'S BEEN AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND WE THINK THE BILL SHOULD BE LIMITED THE BILL APPLIES TO ALL FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT CLAIMS ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION IS NOT LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND WHILE WE DO THINK OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION CAN BE DRAMATIC. WE DO THINK THE CONVERSATION HAS REVEALED THERE SOME UNIQUE DYNAMICS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS. THAT MAY WARRANT A LONGER STATUTORY PERIOD. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE PROPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SPLITTING -- FIAT CAUSES OF ACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS IN THE LABOR CODE CONTEXT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CLAIMS WITH DIFFERENT STATUTORY -- PERIOD YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR WAGE CLAIMS YOU HAVE FOR YEARS IF YOU BRING UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIM. YOU HAVE ONE YEAR FOR POCKET CLAIM SO IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED TO HAVE DIFFERENT STATUTORY -- PERIODS. SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SHOULD BE -- NARROWED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS WE ALSO BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD CLEARLY ONLY APPLY TO CLAIMS ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS AND I BELIEVE MR MCHALE HE'S GONNA TALK MORE ABOUT THAT POINT WITH MY WITH THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS WE WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE IF I COULD MISTER EVANS COMMENT THAT -- THE REASON -- FOR A NARROWING AND OBVIOUSLY AS YOUR ANALYSIS ADDRESSES ON PAGE THREE WITH THE WITH THE EXTENSION THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MOST GOOD EMPLOYERS IF YOU WILL. WANT TO ADDRESS THE BAD ACTORS THE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION IMMEDIATELY AND A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN IS BY EXTENDING IT. FOR SUCH A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAT IT DOESN'T ENABLE THE EMPLOYER TO PROMPTLY ADDRESS -- THAT THAT CONCERNED ACTIVITY. OF THE DISCUSSION OF YOUR OF THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS IS ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR ANALYSIS. WHAT WE HAVE SIDE AND WE SAW IT LAST YEAR MADAM CHAIR YOU MAY RECALL THE DISCUSSION -- IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IRONICALLY RIGHT -- ON A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY WAS THIS CONCERN ABOUT RESURRECTING OR PERHAPS EXTENDING -- CLAIMS THAT HAD ALREADY LAPSED UNDER THE EXISTING STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE LANGUAGE THAT -- THE AUTHOR PUT INTO THE BILL IN AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY AND CONTINUES A SPEAKS TO THE REVIVAL OF LAPS CLAIMS -- AS MR EBBING COLLUDED TO WE WOULD PREFER A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT THAT THE INCREASE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ASSUMING THAT -- YOU PROCEED WITH THAT PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT IT BE LIMITED TO CLAIMS FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR DELINEATION. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE POTENTIAL A REVIVAL OR IS YOUR ANALYSIS OF A LEADS -- TO POSSIBLY EXTENDING -- TO THINGS THAT HAVE -- A NOT EXPIRED AS OF THIS DATE SO IS MISTER AND MAKE INDICATED WE LET'S HOPE EXCUSE ME WE CLOSE THE DOOR. PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR LET'S CLOSE THE DOOR IT'S HARD TO HEAR HIM AS IT IS AND IF WE COULD. IF WE COULD HAVE THE SERGEANTS JUST TRY TO KEEP THE DOORS CLOSED SO WE CAN HEAR THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU. SO AGAIN WE WE WOULD KNOW WITH THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS I THINK MOST OF THE BUSINESS COALITION WOULD REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYOTHER WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT BRINGING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS. OF WE CANNOT MOVE A BILL UNTIL WE HAVE ONE MORE MEMBER WE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM -- SEEING NO QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE TWO ITEMS OF CONCERN LISTED BY THE OPPOSITION. IN YOUR CLOTHES. OUR EXPERT RESPOND TO THOSE IF I MAY. I WOULD JUST NOTE -- MINE UNDERSTANDING IS THE INTENTION OF BILLS NOT TO RELAPSE CLAIMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXPIRED AND TOLD -- AND THAT'S THE INTENTION OF AUTHORS MY UNDERSTANDING AND THEN SECOND WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSITION THAT THE BILL ONLY APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS -- THE PROPOSAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS ADVOCATES AND LAWYERS WHO WORK ON THESE CASES -- WHICH IS SHARED BY MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS THAT IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE TO HAVE A SUCH LIMITATIONS FOR ONE TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION AND A DIFFERENT SUCH A LIMITATION FOR OTHER. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT MANY WORKERS FACE INTERSECTIONAL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION SO MANY WORKERS DO NOT JUST FACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORK OR OTHER FORMS OF SEX BASED DISCRIMINATION THEY ALSO FACE DISCRIMINATION OTHER PROTECTED BASIE'S. SUCH AS RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN AND OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES SO WOULD BE UNWORKABLE FOR THE D. FBIH TO BE ABLE TO APPLY OR HAVE TO APPLY DIFFERENT SUCH AS LIMITATION THAT HAVE TO TRY TO DECIPHER WHICH FORM OF DISCRIMINATION WAS AT PLAY WHEN OFTEN IT REALLY IS. INTERSECTION ON NATURE. THANK YOU AND THE THE SENATOR ON BURKE. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. IT IS UNDERSTOOD IS NOT YOUR INTENT TO BE ABLE TO REVIVE. A CLAIMS ARE YOU GOING TO ADD CLARIFYING LANGUAGES THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IF IT. IT'S ALREADY INCLUDED -- A SECTION TO SAYS THIS ACTUAL NOT BE INTERPRETED TO REVIVE LAPSED CLAIMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME. WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE ASIDE LOVE TO HEAR TODAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WHEN WE GET A QUORUM WE WILL. ACCEPT THE MOTION -- AND IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE WE COULD GET THE OF THE THE SERGEANT IF THERE'S ANYBODY WE COULD GET TO COME JOIN US SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM IT WILL HELP US. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU ALSO HAVE -- ANOTHER ITEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES. FILE ITEM. SEVEN A. B. -- ONE SEVENTY NINE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB ONE SEVENTY NINE IS A BILL THAT MAKES CHANGES TO THE FRANCHISE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS AND AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS. NEW CAR DEALERS OPERATING AS LOCAL INDEPENDENTLY OWNED FRANCHISED DEALERSHIPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES EMPLOY. OVER ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE THE MAJOR SOURCES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN LARGE MULTINATIONAL AUTO MAKERS AND CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERS IS A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE PLAYING FIELD. THIS BILL MAKES KEY CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA'S MOTOR VEHICLE FRANCHISE LAW INCLUDING RETAIL REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR WORK PERFORMED UNDER WARRANTY DEALER PROTEST TO THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE FORD. REGARDING ON REASONABLE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. PROHIBITION ON BE UNREASONABLE IT UNREASONABLE FACILITY UPGRADES AND OTHER REASONABLE CHANGES. THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF WELL OVER TWENTY HOURS OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SPONSOR AND AUTOMAKERS. HERE WITH ME TO TODAY TO TESTIFY. AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- IS CLIFF ACOSTA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES PLEASE OR LESS WILL DO THAT. TO MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS CLUB CONSTANTLY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. TRY TO BE AS BRIEFAS I CAN -- CALVARY FRANCHISE LAWS ARE IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES THEY HELP BALANCE THE INEQUITIES BETWEEN MULTINATIONAL CONGLOMERATE AUTO MANUFACTURERS [inaudible] IN THE DEALERS WHO ARE STILL OPERATING AS MOM AND POPS IN EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS -- AB -- ONE SEVENTY NINE TO YOU MADAM CHAIR LOOKS FAMILIAR -- THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS A BILL LAST YEAR I THAT -- MYSTERIOUS SO WONDERFULLY CARRIED FOR US -- THAT WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED -- AND DESPITE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT SO THIS YEAR WE GOT DOWN TO IT WE BELIEVE WE'VE ADDRESSED THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE BY DEALING WITH -- HOW YOU CALCULATE LABOR RATES -- WE GO NOW FROM A WISCONSIN MODEL WHICH IS WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR TO A MODEL THAT NOW CONFORMS WITH THIRTY FOUR OTHER STATES -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ADDRESSES GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE. AND WE BELIEVE WE'VE COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING -- WITH THE AUTO MAKERS WHO -- ARE GONNA COME UP AND SPEAK IN A MINUTE -- AND FOR THAT. I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY BUT WHEN YOU GET A QUORUM AND CHECK THING. WITH THIS PLACE MADAM CHAIR AT THE DIRECTION OF THE CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THE BILL. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR -- WORKING WITH US EARLIER THIS YEAR -- TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE SAW ON THE BILL LAST YEAR WE THINK THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU. ALTHOUGH WE ARE STILL POSES A MUCH BETTER PRODUCT THEN THE BILL THAT WAS BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- TO ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE IS A SEASON OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. IRAN PLANNING ON YOU HAVE SEEN A NATIONAL WARRANT CORPORATION. I WAS MOST AMENDED WE HAD A PRODUCTIVE MEETING LAST WEEK WITH SPONSORING. RESOLUTION THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU. I ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS ANY QUESTIONS. CURRENT APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE YOUR ROOM. BRINGING THE BILL BACK IN THE WITH THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN THE AFFECTED THE TEAM'S EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE STEP FOR CONSUMERS AND ALSO FOR THE INDUSTRY ITSELF SO. WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. I LIKE YOUR COMMENTS MADAM CHAIR WITHOUT TO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE VERY GOOD AND WHEN WE GET OUR QUORUM -- WE WILL CERTAINLY -- ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SHAKE YOUR BREVITY. ALL RIGHT TO DOWN ONLY A HUNDRED MORE TO GO [inaudible] SO -- NEXT WE'RE GOING. TO TAKE UP I THINK A ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S BILL. OF FILE ITEM. THREE AB. FORTY FOUR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WE DID RECEIVE OF OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SINCE OUR LETTER DEADLINE -- IN MORE CONTINUE TO COME INTO THE COMMITTEE BUT DEADLINES OF GOTTA HAVE SOME MEANING SO I'M JUST ANNOUNCING THAT -- ALTHOUGH -- THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT LATE BUT CLEARLY THERE ARE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE. AND SO WITH THAT -- PLEASE SIR FEEL FREE -- TO PRESENT ON FILE ITEM. THREE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ABOUT HALF OF THEM WERE IN THE HALLWAY READY READY TODAY -- I CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FORTY FOUR WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL TO SELLER MANUFACTURE A NEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS YEARS INCOMING -- WE HAVE HEARD FROM MAJOR RETAILERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO FINE HUMANELY SOURCE -- FOR WE'VE KNOWN FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE UNDER COVER FOR YEARS IN THE FOR INDUSTRY. THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CREATE -- AND WE'RE TO YEAH AND TO BE ASSURED OF HUMANELY RAISED FOR NOW TO BE CLEAR WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT FOR FROM DOMESTICATED ANIMALS. LIKE GO TO HOW -- IN SHEEP THOSE UNDER OUR BILL ARE ALLOWABLE TO BE SOLD WE'RE ALSO NOT TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OTHER HIGH PRODUCTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR FROM ANIMALS THAT ARE RAISED OR TRAPPED IN THE WILD SPECIFICALLY FOR AND ONLY FOR THEIR FOR ANIMALS LIKE FOX. AND BEAVER AND SEAL AND OTHER ANIMALS WHO ARE SOMETIMES TRAPPED IN THE WILD AND LEFT FOR DAYS TO SUFFER IN LAKE TRAPS OR RAISED IN SMALL CRAMPED CAGES WHICH ARE VERY CONTRARY TO THEIR NATURES WILD ANIMALS. IMMENSELY RUSS LAUDER JUST FOR THE USE OF THEIR FOR WE HAVE OUT NOW HAVE SO MANY OTHER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO US FROM PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;-&lt;/c&gt;</u> FOR THE TO WHICH NOW IS AS REAL LOOKING IS REAL FIRST SO REAL LOOKING THAT CONSUMERS HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN FOOLED INTO BUYING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS -- FOR FOR ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS REAL FUR I'M KIND OF A REVERSIBLE AS WHAT USED TO HAPPEN IN THE INDUSTRY. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE VALUES THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE EXPRESSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGH THEIR OWN LEGISLATION THROUGH BALLOT PROPOSITIONS CALIFORNIA'S THEMSELVES HAVE PLACED ON THE BALLOT MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH. THAT IT THAT A. BEARING HANDS HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO LIVE HUMANELY THAT FARM ANIMALS HAVE ENOUGH ROOM TO MOVE AROUND IN AN AUTOMOBILE IT CABS AREN'T RAISED IN SMALL CASE -- PENS FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES THEY'VE EXPRESSED THAT DESIRE TO KNOW THAT IF A PRODUCT IS SOLD ON THE SHELVES IN CALIFORNIA AND IT HAS ANIMAL PRODUCTS. THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THAT ANIMAL WAS RAISED HUMANELY AND SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY WE CANNOT MAKE THAT GUARANTEE OUR CITIZENS WITH FOR PRODUCTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE BOTTOM LINE. SO RETAILERS LIKE GUCCI AND MICHAEL CORES JIMMY CHOO ARMANI BURBERRY VERSACE DIANE VON FURSTENBERG AND MANY MORE HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING FOR FREE WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA AS A TRAILBLAZER SHOULD BE THE FIRST ONE OUT OF THE GATE AS A STATE TO SAY. WE KNOW THAT FOR THAT COMES INTO OUR STATE FROM ASIA FROM EASTERN EUROPE THERE'S NO WAY OF GUARANTEEING THAT THAT WAS SAFELY YOU'RE HUMANELY SOURCED SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO BE SOLD. IN OUR STATE LASTLY MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS LIKE LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ALREADY GONE FOR FREE THAT'S RELATED THAT'S WRIST. THAT HAS CREATED A PATCHWORK OF REGULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S UNTENABLE WE THINK NOW WE SHOULD STREAMLINED TO MAKE IT STATE WIDE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FORTY FOUR AS PJ SMITH DIRECTION OF FASHION POLICY WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY AND VERONICA RASKIN DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY WITH ANIMAL HOPING LEGISLATION. WITHOUT A RETURNS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MY NAME'S PJ SMITH ON THE DIRECTOR OF FASHION POLICY FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES OF PRO CO SPONSOR OF AB. FORTY FOUR FOUR DECADE I'VE WORKED WITH A TOP APPAREL COMPANIES FROM PRADA TO TJ MAX TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT ARE GOOD FOR ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN THESE COMPANIES EXAMINE THE FUR TRADE CLOSELY THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THERE'S NO WAY TO HUMANELY SOURCE? FOR AND THEY GO FOR FREE WHICH SO MANY HAVE. AS WELL CONSUMERS ARE REJECTING PRODUCTS ASSOCIATE WITH ANIMAL CRUELTY BUT RATHER THAN PREPARING FOR THOSE CHANGING TASTES THE FUR TRADE HAS CHOSEN TO CREATE SMOKE SCREENS TO COVER UP THE IMMENSE SUFFERING IT CAUSES. THE LATEST GREENWASHING ATTEMPT IS CALLED FOR MARK WHICH IS SIMPLY A CODIFICATION OF EXIT EXISTING ABUSIVE PRACTICES THE FUR TRADE IS TRYING TO LEGITIMIZE. UNDER FOR MARK ON DOMESTICATED ANIMALS ARE STILL CRAMMED IMPAIRED CAGES FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES ARE CALLED IN STEEL LIKE COLD TRAPS FOR DAYS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER. FOX'S RACCOON DOGS ARE KATE KILLED BY AN ELECTROCUTION AND MAKE OUR CRUDELY GAS THESE OTHER PRESCRIBED METHODS OF SLAUGHTER UNDER THE FOR FOR MARK. NO MATTER HOW THE FUR TRADE TRIES TO SPIN IT THESE PRACTICES ARE CRUEL AND THEY'RE DONE BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAP AND THEY DON'T DAMAGE THE PELTS. LAST WEEK IRELAND'S GOVERNMENT AGREED TO PHASE OUT FOR FARMINGWITH THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE SAYING IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN A SOCIETAL SHIFT IN EXPECTATIONS IN RELATION. TO IN RELATION TO THE SECTOR IN RECENT THAT NEARING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT FARMING MINK IS COUNTER TO GOOD AND A WELFARE. TAKING THESE CONSIDERATIONS INTO ACCOUNT IT IS CONSIDERED TIMELY TO COMMENCE THE PHASING OUT OF THE INDUSTRY IN IRELAND. NEARLY A HUNDRED CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS AGREE ENOUGH SUPPORTED AB. FORTY FOUR WITH THIS PASSAGE OF IT WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB FORTY FOUR CALIFORNIA CONSIDER FIGHTS POSITION AS THE NAY STREET NATION'S MOST INNOVATIVE IN HUMANE STATE WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YES THANK YOU. MY NAME IS VERONICA RAF KIND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT ANIMAL HOPE AND LEGISLATION. OF OUR WORK INCLUDES INVESTIGATIONS INTO FOR FARMS MARK CHIANG OUR FOUNDER HAS HIMSELF BEEN UNDER COVER AND FOR FARMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. HE HAS BEEN TO FOR FARMS IN CHINA IN FINLAND HE HAS BEEN ON SHOPPING EXPEDITIONS IN CANADA. ARE FOOTAGE INCLUDES ANIMALS BEING SKINNED ALIVE. AND WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE DOCUMENTED AND HUMANE CONDITIONS IN THE FOR INDUSTRY. THERE ARE COUNTLESS IMAGES AND VIDEOS FROM GROUPS ALL OVER THE WORLD. THAT SHOW THE ERECTION A REVIEW TO PULL CRUELTY THAT IS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE ON OFTEN PART OF STANDARD PRACTICE ON FOR FARMS. THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ETHICAL. FOR THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHERE BEST CURRENT PRACTICE INVOLVES KEEPING WILD ANIMALS IN VERY SMALL CAGES FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. THEIR FEET NEVER TOUCHING THE GROUND. THIS ENVIRONMENT LEADS TO ABNORMAL REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS SELF MUTILATION AND CANNIBALIZING OF CAGE MADE. THESE BEHAVIORS ARE INDUCED BY FRUSTRATION REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO COPE WITH LIFE ON A FOR FARM. IT'S ALSO AN UNREFUTED FACT. THAT BEST CURRENT PRACTICE INCLUDES KILLING ANIMALS BY GASSING IN AN ELECTROCUTION WELL FIRST STANDARDS THAT ARE PART OF FOR MARKETS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE OPPOSITION. EVEN INCLUDE PERCUSSIVE BLOW TO THE HEAD OF A POSSIBLE KILLING METHOD FOR SICK OR INJURED ANIMALS SUCH AS MINK OR FOX IS. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT OF ALL HOWEVER IS THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. IT'S WHY CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO AND TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM. FOR HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE BANNED THE IMPORT OR UPS OR SALE OF PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN ANIMALS INCLUDING ELEPHANT IVORY WE DECLARED CERTAIN PRACTICES TO CRAWL TO BE TOLERATED LEADING TO BANDS ON FAR GRIND SHARK FAN. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRESSIVE POLICY AND THE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ON IS VERY BUSY TO HATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE ABOUT.

THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TO HAVE ANYONE THAT WANTS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD TO WITNESSES PLEASE TWO MINUTES EACH. THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING. WHO WANTS TO START? ALRIGHT MORNING MADAM CHAIR MORNING BEFORE I START LET ME JUST MAKE ONE THING PERFECTLY CLEAR NO WHEN I REPRESENT. NO FARMER NO RANCHER NO CONSUMER SUPPORT ANIMAL CRUELTY THE CRIME IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S A CRIME EVERYWHERE DECENT PEOPLE LIVE. I'M HERE TODAY. TO APPEAL TO YOUR REASON AND YOU RISK I GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE SURE MICHAEL SENATE MOM I'M A LAWYER IN CALIFORNIA. RENDON REPRESENT A REPRESENT VARIOUS INTEREST IN THE FOR INDUSTRY OKAY NAY RESTLESS POINTS. I'M HERE IS GOING TO APPEAL TO REASON. AND TO YOUR RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IT HAS THE POWER TO REGULATE THE WELFARE OF EVERY ANIMAL IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS BILL REACHES MUCH FARTHER THAN. WHAT HAPPENS WITH IN THE STATE? THE BILL'S AUTHOR IS ACTUALLY ON RECORD SAYING SHE'S CO TRYING TO POLICE WHAT HAPPENS IN CHINA. THE BILL ANALYSIS SAYS IT'S INTENT IS TO SENSIBLY MINIMIZE AN ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. AND THAT'S A VALID OBJECTIVE. BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS WHY BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW HUMANELY THE ANIMALS ARE TREATED NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE TREATED HUMANELY. NO MATTER HOW OTHER EVER TREATED THIS BILL WILL STILL BE ON CALL FOR PRODUCTS FOR EVER. TAKE FOR FROM DENMARK. THIS BILL TREATS THE MAIN PRODUCERS THERE ONE OF THE LEADING PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD AS IF THEY'RE BARBARIANS. DOES THIS LEGISLATURE THINK IT CARES MORE FOR THE ANIMALS AND DENMARK AND THE PEOPLE OF DENMARK. THEN THERE LEGISLATURE'S. THOSE LEGISLATORS THE SUBSTITUTES YOUR JUDGMENT FOR THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE ANIMALS. THERE AT LEAST THREE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE FIRST IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT EVERY ANIMAL. OVER WHICH YOU HAVE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. THAT REGULATE THE WAY ANIMALS ARE TREATED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S HOW YOU SET AN EXAMPLE THAT'S HOW YOU LEAD. NOT BY VIOLATING THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND PUTTING UP BARRIERS TO TRADE. JUST A WEEK AGO THE SUPREME COURT ISSUED A DECISION IN TENNESSEE WINE SPIRITS THAT THE CONSTITUTION WAS ADOPTED FOR REMOVING STATE TRADE BARRIERS BECAUSE STATES NOTORIOUSLY OBSTRUCTED THE INTERSTATE SHIPMENT OF GOODS THAT THE SUPREME COURT. SECOND UNDER THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION A BILL LIKE THIS WOULD BE A CAUSE FOR OTHER COUNTRY THANK YOU YOUR TWO MINUTES IS UP NEXT WITH. PLEASE -- MINUTES. THANKS WHAT HAS TWO MINUTES -- MY NAME IS KATE CAP I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE FUR INFORMATION COUNCIL AMERICA NOT TO ASK YOU TO KILL A. B.. FORTY FOUR BUT TO GET CERTAIN AMENDMENT THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY POSITIVE MOVEMENT ON ANIMAL WELFARE. HERE'S WHY AND THE LUXURY SECTOR BUYERS ARE NOT GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED IF THEY WANNA PRODUCT OF GO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO BUY IT THAT MEANS YOU'RE JUST SHIFTING SALES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH TAX REVENUES BUT YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO AFFECT ANIMALS SECOND BANDS HURT LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES MOST THE GUYS TO FOLLOW THE RULES. YOU'RE PUTTING THEM OUT OF THE BUSINESS BUT YOU'RE FOSTER IN THE GROWTH OF THE ILLEGITIMATE MARKET THE ONES THAT WON'T PAY ATTENTION TO HANDLE WHILE FOR GUIDELINES. YOU CAN BET THEY'RE NOT THE ONES ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION AND YOU CAN BET THAT THIS IS GONNA HURT ANIMAL WELFARE. THIRD EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL ALLOW FOR THE SALE OF FOR FROM CERTAIN ANIMALS IN THE USE OF CERTAIN. FOR BY CERTAIN CULTURAL GROUPS WITHOUT ANY STATEMENT OR REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPLICATION OF ANIMAL WELFARE GUIDELINES OUR MONITORING THAT'S EXACTLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. BUT AN AMENDMENT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO MISS FREEMAN'S OFFICE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM COVERING BOTH WILD AND FARM FOR THIS THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENTLY MONITORED AND USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO GUARANTEE TRANSPARENCY. MISTER JACKSON RESPECTFULLY YOU ASKED THE QUESTION IN THE LAST OF NATURAL RESOURCES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT THE SHIPMENT OF ANIMALS OF AND THE PRODUCT IN FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES COULD BE CERTIFIED AND TRACKED. THERE IS NO INDUSTRY THAT'S MORE HIGHLY REGULATED THIS INDUSTRY UNDER FISH AND WILDLIFE ADMINISTRATION U. S. CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION. UNDER FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION THERE'S A FOR PRODUCT LABELING Là OTHER SOCIETIES THERE'S A DANGER SPECIES ACT OF THE DOG CAT PROTECTION ACT. I URGE YOU TO CONTACT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO FIND OUT JUST HOW IRON CLAD THIS IS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU WHEN MY CLIENTS KNOWN SHIPPERS HAVE GOODS SHIPPED IN HERE IF THEY EVEN ADD AN EXTRA S. ON THE SCIENTIFIC NAME. OR HAVE TWO PAIRS OF SHOES IN A BOX AND ONE DOCUMENT ONLY SAYS ONE ITEM. THAT SHIPMENT IS HELD IT IS IRON CLAD SO YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY CERTIFY THAT WHAT IS IN THE PACKAGE AND THE DOCUMENTATION MATCH AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE CERTIFICATION.

MADAM CHAIR WHILE THE ANIMAL WELFARE AND SHIPPING AN INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE IMPORTANT THERE BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE SO I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S COMPONENTS WHICH I BELIEVE OF THE CIVIL PENALTIES. AND ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS WE JUST NARROWED AND AS I SEE IT THIS IS. A PROVISION THAT SAYS -- EACH FOR PRODUCT CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION AND THEN EARLIER THE TALKS ABOUT A VIOLATION IS SUBJECT TO A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION SO. MY QUESTION IS WHEN AN OCCURRENCE YOU HAVE OPEN UP A BOX IN THEIR SIX FIRST IN THERE IS THAT. ONE VIOLATION TO VIOLATIONS THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN OR IS IT. A VIOLATION BECAUSE THIS IN A BOX. THE IT SAYS EACH FOR PRODUCT IS THIS OF CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION SO I WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE PER ITEM. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION AND THE OTHER IS THE THIS EXTENDS THE AUTHORITY TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S TO BRING ACTIONS. THIS IS THAT CORRECT AND ACTUALLY. IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IT CAN BE BROUGHT IN THE COUNTY BUT THEN THE PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE CONTROLLER FOR DEPOSITING FISHING GAME -- FOR PRESERVE FINE SO IT DOES GO TO THE CONTROL OR THE THE VIOLATION. THE FINE GO SIT DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT SAYS THE DEPARTMENT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE CITY ATTORNEY OF THE CITY OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR COUNTY COUNCIL THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE VIOLATION OF SUBDIVISION. THE COURAGE MAY BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO RECOVER THE CIVIL PENALTY -- YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE ITS IT'S IT MAY MAYES SO THEY ALL HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN THE JURISDICTION TO DO IT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT YES CENTER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HAVE A QUESTION I WAS UNCLEAR ABOUT THE ANTLERS -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. I'M GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO HOW THAT PLAYS OUT THERE'S A IT'S IT'S BASICALLY CLEAR FIND ANTLERS ARE NOT PART OF THIS THEY'RE NOT NOT. FOR RIGHT. YEAH AND AND THERE WERE THERE WAS THERE WERE A LOT OF PARTS OF THIS THAT SAVINGS LIKE IF YOU'VE HUNTED ANIMAL I WITH A DOMESTIC HUNTING LICENSE. YOU CAN USE THAT ANIMALS FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING. TO REALLY TARGET YOU KNOW THE IN THE OF THE FUR INDUSTRY THAT'S SELLING THESE PRODUCTS FOR FASHION NOT SOMEONE WHO'S GONE HUNTING AND BROUGHT HOME. A DEER HEAD WITH ANOTHER. IS COVERED BY OTHER LAWS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT OUT WITH THAT -- OF THE CONSCIOUS ART WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI TE MOTION IS TO PASS. THE SENATE APPROACH -- I'D LIKE YOU IF YOU WOULD IN YOUR CLOTHES. I I FEEL THAT HAS SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY POINTS OUT APPROPRIATELY OUR COMMITTEE IS TO DEAL WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ISSUES AND I THINK THAT -- THE EXCEPTIONS TO YOUR BILL STRIKE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE -- FOR PROVIDING EXCEPTIONS FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES IF IN FACT YOU THINK THIS IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT ON TRADE I'M SURE WE'LL SEE WE'LL SEE THIS IN COURT BUT I THINK. GIVEN THE PARAMETERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THAT YOU HAVE MET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE THAT WE ARE -- DIRECTED TO CONSIDER AND SO WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD JUST BRIEFLY SAY WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF VERY PASSIONATE ARGUMENTS ON ALL SIDES. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE SUPPORTERS FOR WALKING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES TO BE HERE THAT SHOWS THE DEPTH OF THEIR CARING. ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I HEARD FROM THE OPPONENTS IF YOU SUBSTITUTED. ELEPHANT IVORY FOR FOR YOU PROBABLY BE ABLE TO MAKE A LOT OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS WIDELY REGULATING ANIMALS THAT ARE -- RAISED OVERSEAS THAT IT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE OF THOSE COUNTRIES TO DECIDE ABOUT THEIR WELFARE WILL YOU COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT ELEPHANT IVORY WHERE WE CARING ABOUT -- PRODUCTS THAT ARE SHOULD BE REGULATING PRODUCTS THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR STATE I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT ELEPHANT IVORY. THIS PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY CARE ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE WE SIMPLY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE WELFARE OF IN THESE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN RAISED. FOR FOR IF THEY HAD A SYSTEM OF TRACKING THAT WAS SO GREAT. INVOLVING BLOCKCHAIN I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE IT BY NOW -- THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE -- AND WE'RE STILL HEARING ABOUT ABUSE IS NOT JUST NOT FOR THE KURDISH PEOPLE FROM CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS WHO'VE TRIED HUMANELY SOURCE FOR AND FELT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE. TO WITHOUT I WOULD REQUEST FROM THE REQUEST AND I BOTH. VERY GOOD -- WE'RE GOING TO GIVE A ONE MORE MOMENT. FOR ANYONE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE SOMEONE WHO -- IS -- COMING. DOWN FROM AN ELEVATOR WHO -- WE WOULD LIKE TO AT LEAST GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS HER. SUPPORT UP I BELIEVE IT'S SUPPORTER OPPOSITION BUT IF WE WE COULD TAKE ONE MOMENT WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S. MADE A VERY STRONG EFFORT MAYBE HASN'T WALKED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES BUT IN HER OWN WAY HAS. REALLY ASKED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS SO SHE SHOULD BE HERE ANY SECOND I HOPE [inaudible] ALL. WELL ACTUALLY WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MOTIONS ON ANY OF THE OTHER BILLS SO -- CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL ON THIS BILL XIN. IT WAS A VERY GOOD THOUGHT BUT I'M AFRAID WE WE CAN'T -- IF YOU'RE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. THAT WOULD OLY. ALLOW US TO OPEN UP FOR THE A AND THE SUPPORT TO AND WE'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH BILLS LEFT YOUR TESTIMONY. RIGHT WE HAVE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] RIGHT YEAH. I GUESS.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN YOU HAVE -- FILE ITEM -- FIFTY TWO WITCHES AB. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ARE YOU TO HAVE ANOTHER ITEM BUT THAT IS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR -- SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH FILE ITEM FIFTY TWO AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AUTHORIZES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO ENFORCE EXISTING WATER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- A SOME THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOR DECADES WHILE EACH OF THE FOUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW THE LAW IS SILENT ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF NON REPORTING. NOW WHILE MOST OF OUR WATER AGENCIES DO TAKE TH REPORTING SERIOUSLY AND DO THEIR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS WE REQUIRE THEM TO DO THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT DO NOT AND SO COMPLIANCE IS BODY. WITHOUT EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS FOR NON REPORTING LOCAL ENTITIES ARE NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR LATE OR MISSING REPORTS AND PLANS. FOR THE MORE D. W. I. HAS NOT CREATED OR PUBLISHED A MASTER LIST OF ALL THE LOCAL ENTITIES WERE PART REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING WATER REPORTING LAWS. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE RATE OF NON COMPLIANCE AND WHICH DISTRICTS ARE CONSISTENTLY NON COMPLIANT. NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S BEEN MOVING TO THE LEGISLATURE TO STREAMLINE WATER REPORT REPORTING SO THAT IT'S EASIER FOR OUR WATER AGENCIES. SO THERE'S REALLY KIND OF NO EXCUSE WHAT THIS BILL DOES GIVE OFF FRANCE FOR D. W. R. TO WORK WITH AGENCIES IF THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO COMPLY. AND REALLY WITHHOLD THE PENALTIES UNTIL IT'S CLEAR THAT AGENCIES ARE JUST NOT INTERESTED IN COMPLYING WITH OUR LAW -- SAID AND THEY'RE ALSO AUTHORIZED TO EXTEND DEADLINES AND TO WAIVE PENALTIES ENTIRELY IF THEY FELT FEEL THAT AGENCIES ARE MAKING THEIR BEST ATTEMPT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS NIKITA KARATE WITH AND ART -- IN OUR DC TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WE EXPECT OUR TAXPAYERS TO COMPLY WITH OUR LOSS THERE'S NO REASON WHY PUBLIC AGENCY SHOULDN'T I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU TRêN MEMBERS NIKITA CREDIT WITH THE NOT TO RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN I'M AS YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS BILL AUTHORIZES D. W. R. TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING WATER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS IT DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW WERE REPORTING REQUIREMENT. IT'S SIMPLY POWERS DID OF YOU ARE TO ENFORCE THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE DATA HAVE VALUE WHEN THE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CRITICAL WATER USE DATA DO NOT COMPLY WITH LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE PICTURE HOW WE USE AND MANAGE OUR WATER ACROSS THE STATE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR TARGETED INVESTMENTS AND EFFICIENCY ARE LOST AND THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THE WATER CONSERVATION LAWS THAT THIS BODY IS PASSED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- IS LEFT COMPROMISED THANKFULLY AT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN CAN HELP FIX THIS LEAKY WATER DATA PIPELINE BY PROVIDING DID OF YOU ARE WITH A TOOL TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE -- AND WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND WATER ISSUES MORE BROADLY OVER THE YEARS AND OUR DRIVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. PLEASE OKAY -- CHERRY MEMBERS I'M JULIE HALL WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES -- WELL WE APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF INCREASING REPORTING TO HELP INFORM DECISION MAKING AT THE STATE LEVEL -- WE'RE OPPOSE THE APPROACH TO THIS BILL TAKES A CURRENTLY UNDER THE BILL THE FIRST WARNING A LOCAL AGENCY WOULD RECEIVE FOR FAILURE TO SUBMIT ONE OF THESE REPORTS ON TIME WILL BE A CIVIL PENALTY OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL CERTAIN AGENCIES MAY QUALIFY FOR MITIGATION OF THAT PENALTY THE PENALTY IS UNLESS THE FIRST STEP TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WHICH IS A DISPROPORTIONATELY HARSH RESPONSE TO A LATE INFORMATIONAL REPORT OR PLAN -- IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SET A NEW PRECEDENT IN THE WATER CODE THERE ARE NO OTHER INFOMATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE CIVIL PENALTY. IN THE VERY SELECT INSTANCES WERE SOLD PENALTY AUTHORITY WAS PROVIDED IN STATURE HER LATE INFORMATIONAL REPORT. THE STATUE PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REPORTING ENTITY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BEFORE THE PENALTY IS ISSUED. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME PATHWAY TO COMPLIANCE INSTEAD THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO FIND FIRST AND THEN ASK QUESTIONS LATER -- WE SHARED MEMBERS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE THAT WOULD INCLUDE IN THIS PROCESS AND NOTIFICATION TO THE LOCAL ENTITY OF THEIR FAILURE TO SUBMIT A REPORT. TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE ON THEIR OWN BEFORE THE CIVIL PENALTIES ISSUED. THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL ENTITY TO CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE WITHOUT HARSH PENALTIES AND WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OVERALL REPORTING COMPLIANCE. WE HAVE THE OTHER WILL CONSIDER THESE AMENDMENTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH HER AND HER STAFF ON A MORE GRADUAL APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE -- I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER OPPOSITION ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS [inaudible] AGAIN OF THE PENALTIES ARE THE FOCAL POINT AND THE GOAL OF COURSE IS TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PENALTY -- GIVEN THE WE NEED TO HAVE THESE REPORTS SO THAT WE CAN FOR FILL THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT CAN FILL ITS DUTIES AYE I THINK THAT MAKES EMINENTLY GOOD SENSE AND I'M SURE YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING TO THE EXTENT THERE MAY BE SOME WAY. TO FIND AN ACCOMMODATION HERE BECAUSE I THINK THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS. A GOOD ONE AND IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER OPTIONS GREAT OTHERWISE.

FOURTEEN FIFTEEN JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORGES'S RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES MONNING STERN I'M BURKE. NUMBER AYE WIECKOWSKI RECALLS THE AYE BY THE ZERO FIVE TWO ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN YOU HAVE ONE MORE BILL AND I APOLOGIZE THEY JUMPED OVER THE FIRST TIME IT'S FILE ITEM THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS AB. ELEVEN FORTY TWO FILE ITEM. THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THEIR ANALYSIS AND FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE BILL I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES THE TRANSFER SET TRANSPORTATION SECTOR NOW ACCOUNTS 440% OF THE STATE'S TOTL EMISSIONS. AND THE NUMBER IS GROWING IT'S THE ONE AREA WERE CALIFORNIA'S REALLY GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- CALIFORNIA IS CLEARLY NOT ON THE TRAJECTORY TO MEET A TRANSPORTATION GHG EMISSION TARGETS FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE CARDS SB ONE FIFTY REPORT IDENTIFIED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES PREVENTING THE STATE. FOR MEDIA TRANSPORTATION GOALS ONE WAS AT THE STATE AND REGIONAL AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT DATA TO ACCURATELY MODEL AND PLAN FOR TNC. AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO REQUIRES CALIFORNIA'S NPOS. TO INCLUDE METRICS ABOUT TNC IS AS PART OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE TRANSPORTATION PLANS TO INCLUDE INCLUDE MEASUREMENTS REGARDING BARRIERS. UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT INCLUDING TRANSIT FREQUENTLY PARKING AND FACILITIES FOR BICYCLES. IN ADDITION AB FORTY TO DIRECT THE CPUC TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF NPOS AND OTHER STATE MOTOR LOCAL AGENCIES IN PLANNING AND MEETING THEIR SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGY GOALS. WHEN DECIDING ON TNC DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS? NPOS IN OTHER TRANSPORTATION EIGHT ENTITIES NEED APPROPRIATE DATA IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES TO REDUCE THE USE OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES. INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSIT UTILIZATION AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BASICALLY YOU CANNOT PLAN FOR WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW. IF YOU IS AN AGENCY DON'T KNOW HOW UBER AND LIFT ARE AFFECTING YOUR COMMUNITY YOU CAN'T MAKE PLANS TO HELP YOUR COMMUNITY MOVE. MOVE AROUND THEIR CITY BETTER THIS UPDATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS AN ADDED DIRECTION FOR THE CP UC'S REGARDING TNC DATA REPORTING WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF TRANSPORTATION POLICIES. AND WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS LONG TERM CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION GOALS. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE IMPORTANT ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SP ONE FIFTY REPORT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU'D PROTECTING USER DATA. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR DANIEL BARRETT ON BEHALF OF THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND LINDA COMMERCIALLY AND ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BY MY SCHOOL TOLD.

ELEVEN FORTY TWO WELL ADDRESS GAPS IN CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES BY REQUIRING REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN THE MEASURE TRIPS MADE BY TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES. AND IDENTIFY COMMUNITY SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT REDUCE UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE P. YOU SEE TO CONSIDER LONG TERM PLANNING NEEDS. TO STAND ABOUT COMMUNITY STRATEGIES. OF NPOS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES WHEN DETERMINING THE DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TNC. IS REQUIREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REACHING CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE CALLS WE ARE CHEN AYE ABOUT ON ELEVEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD MORNING SENATORS AT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S AT LEADERSHIP ON THIS IS THIS A CRITICAL I'M MY NAME IS ON THE COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION HERE AND URGING YOUR AT YOUR SUPPORT ON AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO AND WHAT'S. BEEN SAID HERE READY IS A CRITICAL POINT WHERE WE'VE BEEN REPEATING THIS AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WHEN WE'VE LEARNED THAT WE'RE NOT READ REACHING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION -- GOALS -- IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND SO ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IS CRITICAL. AND AT THE REASON IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION PLANNING IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND WE KNOW THAT TNC HAVE BECOME. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PICTURE AND AS WE ARE ADVANCING A TECHNOLOGIES AND DIFFERENT MODES OF OF SHARED MOBILITY THIS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT AND EQUIPPING OUR REGIONALAGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS MORE CLOSELY AND MODEL. I'M MORE ACCURATELY IS A CRITICAL AND IMPRINT -- POINT AND SO WE ARE DRIVE OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STEP FOR DAMON AFFILIATION PLEASE. NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COURTNEY JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECHNET AND THANK YOU -- TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE ANALYSIS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THEY THAT WE CONTINUE BELIEVE NEED TO BE CLEANED UP -- THE BILL -- THE DATA SHARING REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL WHEN IN IN THE SECOND HOUSE AND SO IT'S BEEN SORT OF A QUICK PROCESS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT DATE IS ACTUALLY NEEDED AND WHAT PER PACK PRECISE PURPOSE IT'S NEEDED -- FOR THE RIDE CHER INDUSTRY ENABLES MOBILITY FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND WITH ANY OF THESE PLATFORMS IS DATA THAT WE UNDERSTAND CAN BE USEFUL FOR PLANNING PURPOSES HOWEVER THOSE USES MUST BE BALANCED WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RISK CREATED BY SHARING OF GEO LOCATION. AND MOVEMENT DATA OF PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS WITHOUT ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS THIS DATA CAN BE CAN INCLUDE DETAILED ORIGIN AND DESTINATION INFORMATION TIME STAMPS AND MILES TRAVELED. TRIP DATA IF NOT SUFFICIENTLY AGGREGATED COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED TO ESTABLISH AN INDIVIDUAL'S TRAVEL PATTERNS AND POTENTIALLY REVEAL SENSITIVE INFORMATION. THE BILL DOES LIMIT THE USE OF DATA TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF TNC IS AND FOR SUSTAINABLE A COMMUNITY PLANNING BUT AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IN THE BILL'S VERY. BROAD AND VAGUE AND THAT COULD JUSTIFY MANY ON WARRANTED AT USES IF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO BE FOR TRANSPORTATION ARE SUSTAINABLE THE LADY PLANNING PURPOSES THEN WE NEED TO MAKE THAT EXTRA CLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT WITH THE AUTHOR BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DATA CANNOT BE USED FOR LOCAL REGULATORY PURPOSES SUCH AS LEVYING FEES OR TAXES -- FINALLY I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR CITIES ARE NOT HELD TO THE SAME SECURITY AND PRIVACY STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO WHO DATA CAN BE SHARED WITH AND HOW IT CAN BE USED. AND THEREFORE THE BILL COULD -- CREATE SIGNIFICANT REST FOR TNC EASY USERS PRIVACY AND SECURITY THE BILL DOES HAVE SOME LANGUAGE AROUND THE RELEVANT DATA SHARING PROTOCOLS -- BUT WE CONTINUE THANK YOU LEAVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE US OVERTHROW WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM TECHNICS COMMENT SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE DEFINITION OF AGGREGATE DATA. AND THE CPC PROCEEDINGS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING AT THE SI PC RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S A CURRENT MULTI YEAR. A REAL MAKING PROCESS OF THE CPC RELATED TO DATA SHARING INCLUDING A DEFINITION OF AGGREGATED. AND THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AS PROVIDED HAS BEEN INCLUDED INPUT FROM THE ENTITIES THAT ARE SOUGHT. TO BE PROTECTED BY THIS BILL INCLUDING CITIES PLANNING AGENCIES AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ENTITIES COMMENTS FILE PERCENT IS PROCEEDING IN OTHER STATEMENTS FOR TRIP DATA HAVE SHOWN THE FAR REACHING INTENT OF HOW THESE ENTITIES MAY USE THE INFORMATION. INCLUDING BY MONETIZING TNC ATA POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING FIFTH AMENDMENT ISSUES. THE CPSC PLANS TO ISSUE PROPOSED DECISION ON THE SCOPE OF TNC DATA SHORTLY WHICH WILL HAVE CONSIDERED AN INCORPORATE THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE MANY STAKEHOLDER SOUGHT TO BE ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL. ON INCLUDING ON THE SCOPE OF AGGREGATED DATA AND THE DEFINITION AND THIS LEGISLATION WHEN UNFORTUNATELY INTERFERE WITH THAT PROCESS THE ULTIMATE DECISIN. ALTHOUGH WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ADD AGGREGATION LANGUAGE TO THE BILL TO AVOID THESE ON INTENSE ACOSTA CONSEQUENCES IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS IT IS IMPORTANTTO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PC REGARDING METHODOLOGY ON EDUCATION. OTHERWISE THE CPC MAY BE LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO SHARE DATA IN A WAY THAT THREATENS THE INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT BEEN RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE IN THE PAST -- AND RESULT IN THE OTHER POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OUT BY MY TECHNET OFFER INFORMATION THAT CONSTITUTES WHAT IS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TRANSPORTATION DATA. THIS NEW ONE HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY THE CPC'S REMAKING PROCEEDING AND WE THINK THAT SHOULD CONTINUE AND FOR THE THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS CAL CHAMBER CONTINUES TO OPPOSE AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU I SWEAR THE CAL CHAMBER TEACHERS THEIR PEOPLE HOW TO TALK SO FAST. WE GET THE GUIDANCE WITHOUT BREATHING SO I'M VERY IMPRESSED. ALL RIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD PLEASE NAME AND AFFILIATION. ACCORDING TO THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL YEAH I'D LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH US IN THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE BUT WHAT AFFILIATE MYSELF WITH THE CONCERNS BOTH OF TECH THAT THE CHAMBER REGARDING BOTH. PURPOSE SPECIFICITY FOR DATA COLLECTION AS WELL AS ITS USE AND SHARING WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORKING UP ON TIGHTENING UP THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THIS SITE TO HIM HEARTENED AT THE CONCERN OF THE INDUSTRY IN THE CHAMBER WILL PROTECTING -- INFORMATION. AND CERTAINLY THIS THEIR CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE THE TERM DE IDENTIFICATION THE DEFINITIONS TOO EXPANSIVE OR IS THERE WILL BE A BILL TODAY WHERE THEY CAN ARGUE THAT VERY DEFINITION IS TOO NARROW. SO -- ALWAYS. NIMBLE -- CERTAINLY -- I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. THE ISSUE BEFORE US IT REALLY DEALS MORE WITH THE PRIVACY. ISSUE AND YOU'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE WHICH IS TO DO PLANNING. AND NOT TO CONTINUE STOCKING AND MONITORING PEOPLE SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- THE AND I THINK THAT THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- AND I THINK THAT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES WE ARE REMINDED OF THE PRIVACY. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. I AM PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE AGREED. TO THOSE AMENDMENTS -- AND AS I UNDERSTAND THEIR INTENDED TO PLACE A FLOOR SO THAT THE INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BUT CERTAINLY DON'T FOR CLOSEST CEILING. THAT WOULD ENSURE SUFFICIENT DATA IS STILL AVAILABLE THAT'S THE THAT'S SORT OF THE FIND THE BALANCE WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK THIS. ACHIEVES THAT SO -- IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ANY ANY CONCERNS CENTER ON SOME -- READY TO MOVE THE BILL I WAS JUST. IF I WAS FOLLOWING THE OPPOSITION EVEN IF IT'S NOT ADEQUATELY DE IDENTIFIED THAT MEANS THAT THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO SELL THAT INFORMATION TO A THIRD PARTY. THAT THEY WOULD USE IT FOR SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC GAIN I GUESS BECAUSE OF THE OR OR THE CITY WOULD GO AFTER PEOPLE FOR OUTSTANDING. TAXES AND PARKING TICKETS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO OF COURSE I THINK THEY AMENDMENTS. GODDESS THERE IS WITH THE RAISE CONCERNS ALL MOVE THE BILL VERY GOOD END OF NOTING TO THAT -- THAT IS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT WILL SEE AND OTHER BILLS WHERE I THINK THE CHAMBER MAY BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT BUT IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING. SENATOR TO RAZA YEAH I JUST WANT. TO REINFORCE I THINK WE'RE BOTH YOU AND FEDERAL HEALTHCARE ARE SAYING IS. WE'RE SORT OF ON THE FLIP SIDE OF SOME OF THESE BILLS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THINGS THAT I ADVOCATE FOR OUR CONSISTENT. YOU KNOW NO MATTER WHAT THE ISSUE OR OR THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP. BUT IT DID. RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW WELL THIS COULD BE USED AND SO MANY OF THE OTHER -- BILLS TOUCH ON THAT IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS NOT USED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW FOR VIOLATIONS OF THINGS THAT THEY COULD BE ACCUSED OF AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THAT GET HIT THE HARDEST WHEN IT COMES -- TO TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WE'RE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKING SURE THAT IT IS [inaudible] NARROW ENOUGH. THAT WE DON'T OPEN UP THE DOOR FOR OTHER USES. THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL I I DO AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY HAVE ADDED TO THE BILL. WHICH DO REQUIRE THE DATES TO BE AGGREGATED SO THAT THERE WILL BE DATA THAT TELLS THE CITY'S BASICALLY WITHIN AN HOUR HERE'S HOW MANY TNC THAT YOU HAD GOING FROM ONE ZIP CODE INTO ANOTHER. AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IS GRANULAR AS THE INFORMATION CAN GET. SO THAT IS VERY PROTECTIVE ALSO GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE THEY REALLY NEED AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVING P. HE SEES P.. RIGHT NOW THE DIRECTION SORRY CPUC. THE DIRECTION -- TO SAY LISTEN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AS FAR TOO BROAD TO BE USEFUL FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CITIES NEED TO NOW -- MORE OF THIS INFORMATION SO THAT THEY KNOW IF THEY HAVE TRANSIT GAPS IF THEY NEED TO RUN ADDITIONAL BUSES HOW THEY CAN REDUCE CONGESTION ON THEIR STREET AND WHAT THE CONGESTION IMPACTS MIGHT BE A TNC IS THAT ARE CIRCULATING WAITING. FOR A SPORTING EVENT AND FOR INSTANCE THAT THE CITIES HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT WHILE PROTECTING. THE DATE OF USERS I WOULD ALSO SAY THOUGH THAT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE PRIVACY THAT WE DO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW CITIES USE DATA. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT ON THE WHOLE AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT SORT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF IT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OVER ARCHING SORT OF HOLISTIC LEGISLATION RATHER THAN SUBJECTING EVERY SINGLE BILL. TO US SORT OF THAT TEST AND THAT'S WHAT THE PRIVACY LEGISLATION DID LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT THERE'S OTHER -- BILLS LOOKING AT THAT AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT YOU KNOW -- YES IS A CONCERN ABOUT HOW CITIES AND HOW PUBLIC AT LEAST USE THAT AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW PRIVATE ENTITIES OR USE IT WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT THE THIS VERY DAY SO THANK YOU AND WE'LL TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOSE APPRECIATED AND WE ARE I THINK. BEING CONSISTENT HERE THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE ASKED FOR THOSE AMENDMENTS IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE INFORMATION BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW EVERY PERSON'S PERSONAL INFORMATION WE DON'T WANT YOUR SELLING IT -- THE CITIES THE CASH NOBODY HAS TO DO THAT TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHY THE AMENDMENTS ARE THERE AND WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS LET'S MOVE. OTHERS A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY EIGHT A. B. ELEVEN FORTY TWO JACKSON HI JACKSON I'VE WERE JUST TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES MONNING STERN UMBERG. NUMBER AYE WHY KELSEY KELSEY I BY THE FIVE TO ZERO THE BILL SO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR MEASURES AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IF WE NEED TO LEAVE -- I'M SORRY THAT I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY -- WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS FORGIVE ME. US ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD WE'RE GOING TO TAKE UP AB -- TWENTY FIVE IT'S FILE ITEM. TO THANK YOU -- FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS I THINK THIS IS A AGAIN IN THE SAME THEME WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING INFORMATION SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE BUT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY RIGHTS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. AND CERTAINLY TO COMPLY WITH THE CCP A A BILL ABOUT WHICH I KNOW YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING -- HAVING BEEN A WORKING ON IT FOR SO MANY MONTHS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BEING HERE AND I IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN YOU ARE ACCEPTING IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THOSE AMENDMENTS ARTICULATED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ENSURING MEMBERS SELL AB TWENTY FIVE CLARIFIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OR CCPA. EXCLUDES INDIVIDUALS WHOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN COLLECTED BY BUSINESS IN THE COURSE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE BUSINESS AS A JOB APPLICANT. TO AN EMPLOYEE OF OWNER OF DIRECTOR OF OFFICER OF MEDICAL STAFF MEMBER OF WILL CONTRACTOR OF THAT BUSINESS BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS COLLECTED IN USE SOLELY. FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE CCPA THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REQUESTS. FOR A FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS ON THIS RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE CCPA. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESS THAT THE CCPA COULD BE READ TO APPLY TO CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR CAPACITY AS EMPLOYEES OR IN SIMILARLY SITUATED CONTACTS TO CAPTURE THEIR EMPLOYEE DATA. WELL WE NEVER ENVISIONED THIS BEING AN ISSUE THIS HAS BEEN EXPRESSED AN S. DRAFTED AND EMPLOYEE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOR EXAMPLE. COULD REQUEST THAT COMPLAINTS ABOUT HIM OR HER A BE EXPUNGED FROM COMPANY FILES. HELLO THIS CLASSIFICATION AND STATURE WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS RETAIN THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE SEA CPA IN THEIR CAPACITY AS CONSUMERS. NOW ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AS THE CONCERNED THAT HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION SUCH AS CREDIT CARD A SOCIAL THE NUMBERS COULD FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE. FOR SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THE BUSINESS HAS COLLECTED ABOUT A CONSUMER. ALL THIS CONCERN EXTENDS TO THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS A CONSUMERS BROWSING HISTORY ARE. WITH OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS OR OTHER USERS OF A SHARED DEVICE PARTICULARLY WITH THE INFORMATION COULD LAND IN THE HANDS OF AN ABUSIVE -- SPOUSE OR PARENT OR A ROOMMATE FOR THAT MATTER WHILE THE CCPA REQUIRES THAT A BUSINESS COMPLY. ONLY UPON RECEIPT OF VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST THE CONCERN RAISED IS THAT A BUSINESS MAY NEED TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE REQUESTING CONSUMER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SENT TO THE RIGHT PERSON ESPECIALLY. WHEN A BUSINESS HAS NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP -- WITH THE CONSUMER OR IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING A SURE HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICE. PART OF THE SOLUTION IS TO ALLOW A BUSINESS TO REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO USE AND ESTABLISH A CAL A TO EXERCISE YOUR SEATS. A RIGHT NOW BY DOING SO IT HELPS TO PREVENT THEM FROM PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO RAW INDIVIDUAL. THIS BILL AB TWENTY FIVE FOR THE CLARIFIES THAT HOW BUSINESS SHALL COMPLY WITH THE CONSUMERS REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR FOR HIS -- I'VE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GLAD TO SEE THE CHAMBER HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THERE BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. WITHOUT THE CLARIFICATION OFFERED BY AB TWENTY FIVE THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER THOSE WHO HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THIS LAW. COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE PEOPLE ACTING IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR THREE REASONS FIRST THE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES WILL BE EXORBITANT IMAGINE A FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT THAT SERVES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TABLES PER DAY. WITHOUT THIS FIX IT MAY HAVE TO OPERATIONALIZE THIS EASY PAY FOR ITS KITCHEN AND WAIT STAFF. IN A BUSINESS WITH HIGH TURNOVER IN LOW PROFIT MARGINS SECOND IS INCREDIBLY BROAD LAW WAS DESIGNED FOR CONSUMERS NOT EMPLOYEES. IMAGINE AN EMPLOYEE MAKING A CPA ACCESS REQUEST THE BUSINESS WOULD HAVE TO GOING TO THE EMPLOYEES OFFICE AND SANNED EVERY PAPER DOCUMENT GATHER ALL THE EMPLOYEES INTERNET SEARCH HISTORY PRODUCE ALL THE EMPLOYEES EMAIL ARCHIVES. EVEN IF THE BUSINESS IS DOING NOTHING WITH ANY OF THIS INFORMATION. THIRD THERE WILL BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA LAW BUT WITHOUT THIS FIX THIS EASY PAY WOULD ALLOW SEPARATED SPOUSE WHO'S PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO GAIN ACCESS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S PAYROLL RECORDS. GIVING EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION COULD BE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYEE CASKET BUSINESS SILLY ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OR TO DELETE INAPPROPRIATE EMAIL SENT TO A CO WORKER BEFORE LAWSUITS FILED. THIS EASY PAY LEGAL CLAIM SECTION WOULD NOT APPLY. FURTHER THIS BILL PROACTIVELY ADDRESSES PRIVAY CONCERNS IN THREE WAYS FIRST SOMEONE IS BOTH AN EMPLOYEE AND CONSUMER BUSINESS WILL STILL RETAIN AUTHOR CCPA RIGHT. AS A CONSUMER. SECOND THE BILL STRONGLY ENCOURAGES BUSINESSES NOT TO USE EMPLOYMENT DATA BEYOND THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT BECAUSE EXEMPTION ONLY APPLIES WHEN EMPLOYMENT DATA IS COLLECTED AND USED SOLELY FOR EMPLOYMENT PURPOSES. AND FINALLY THE RECENT SUNSET AND DISCLOSURE AMENDMENTS ADDED AT THE REQUEST OF LABOR UNIONS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT FIT FOR EMPLOYEES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM TO FIND A BETTER SOLUTION EMPLOYMENT PRIVACY NEXT YEAR. MEMBERS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE HAVE CHEN HELPER -- WITH THE ONLY PAPER TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF WE GET INTO THAT IN THE DEBATE PROCESS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAREN JOE GOOD WHEN AND I'M THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD STAFFING COMPANY EXACT STAFF BASED OUT OF WOODLAND HILLS CALIFORNIA. WE'VE MET BEFORE HIM. I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN STAFFING ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OUR INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR THREE MILLION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE JOBS PEOPLE. STAFFING FIRMS MATCH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WORK WITH CLIENTS THAT NEED HELP TO FILL POSITIONS IN EVERY SKILL AND PROFESSION. THE C. C. P. A. AS WRITTEN WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR STAFFING FIRMS TO PLACE PEOPLE IN JOBS I WANT TO SHARE A QUICK STORY WITH YOU ABOUT VIVIAN SHE'S THE MOTHER OF SIX TEENAGERS. WHO IS RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE SHE WAS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE? SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE AND SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB SHE WAS EMBARRASSED BECAUSE SE FELT HER STAY AT HOME SKILLS WERE RELEVANT IN THE WORKPLACE. I SPENT TWO HOURS WITH HER GOING OVERALL FOR TASKS IS YOU'RE DONE AS A STAY AT HOME MOM AND SHE LEFT CONFIDENT THAT SHE WAS RELEVANT IN THE WORKPLACE THAT AFTERNOON I GOT A CALL FROM A CLIENT LOOKING FOR A RECEPTIONIST. VIVIAN STARTED IN THAT JOB THE NEXT MORNING AND TODAY SHE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING OF THAT FIRM. WHY I BRING THE STORY UP IS BECAUSE FILLING JOBS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY IS ESSENTIAL FOR MY CLIENTS AND MY EMPLOYEES CCPA PRETENDER THAT BY TREATING EMLOYEES AND JOB APPLICANTS AS CONSUMERS? WHICH WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE COSTS AND BURDENS TO MY BUSINESS AND MAKE CONFUSED JOB SEEKERS AND SLOW DOWN THE HIRING PROCESS WHICH COULD COST THEM JOB OPPORTUNITIES. SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE MINE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE COMPLAINTS ATTORNEYS TO COMPLY WITH THIS LAW. THIS IS A BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR OTHER WOMEN LIKE ME TO START THEIR OWN STAFFING BUSINESS AND PUT OTHER PEOPLE TO WORK FOR THESE REASONS I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU.

ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WITH THIS IS BEEN A A TOUGH EFFORT I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I WANT TO THANK STAFF AS WELL. AS WELL AS THE THE VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS THIS IS A VERY TRICKY ISSUE. BECAUSE AS AND AS EMPLOYERS THERE IS DEFINITELY A GOOD REASON -- TO BE ABLE TO GET. SOME INFORMATION ABOUT ONE'S EMPLOYEES AND WE'VE TRIED TO LIMITED THOUGH TO THE SCOPE OF FOR PURPOSES OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. AND THE THE OTHER COUNTERVAILING FACTOR IS THAT WITH SURVEILLANCE AS WAS NOTED WE CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST KNOW WHETHER OR NOT AN EMPLOYEE IS GOING OUT TO LUNCH BETWEEN TWELVE AND ONE WE CAN KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING. WE'RE WHO THEIR MEETING WHAT THEY'RE EATING. AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT BECAUSE WE PUT AS EARLY SUNSET -- ON THIS BILL -- IF YOU WILL THAT THIS WILL BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS REALLY AGAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS MOVED US WELL BEYOND. JUST KNOWING JUST PUNCHING IN. SHOES ME PUNCHING IN AND PUNCHING OUT THE CLOCK IS A PERSON TIMELY OR THEY ARE THEY TAKING THAT THE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY'RE ENTITLED TO OR THEY TAKING MORE. THOSE ARE THE ISSUES WE USED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WE CAN DO A LOT MORE NOW AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE THE EFFORT THAT MOVING FORWARD TO BALANCE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS AND FOR OUR FRIENDS IN THE LABOR COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED. TO IT CONTINUE GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSER IN LESSER ANY QUESTIONS. NO OUR USE THAT AS A CLOSE WE SHOOT THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH. I RESPECTFULLY ASK ARRIVAL IN IT LET ME CLOSE ON THIS NOTE I THIS HAS BEEN A YOUR LONG PROJECT I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. ARE WHO HAVE BEEN VERY -- WILLING AND ABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE AND YOU KNOW NEGOTIATE. AND ARE YOU KNOW I ALSO LIKE TO COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING ON THE EMPLOYEE SURVEILLANCE SITUATION WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND AND IT'S A IT'S A TOPIC THAT REQUIRES A BROADER DISCUSSION. GOING FORWARD AND I YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A ONE YEAR TO WORK ON IT SO I I INVITE THE FOLKS TO COME TO MY OFFICE YOU KNOW I I KEEP AN OPEN DOOR SO -- TRULY WE NEED TO CURRENT ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE PERTINENT TO IN THAT PARTICULAR SPACE SO OB SO I WANT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AGAIN AND SUPPORTERS AND AND YOU ARE YOURSELF OUT AMOUNT CHAIR AND YOUR TEAM.

TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE INDICATED ALL ALONG YOU WANTED THIS TO BE A CONSENSUS BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS. AND SO I TRUST THAT THE BILL WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY WON'T BE AMENDED. TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ITEMS WITHOUT CONSENSUS FROM ALL THE RELEVANT PARTIES I THINK IS A GREAT PLACE. TO STOP AND TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THEN TO MOVE FORWARD IS AS AS NEEDED -- AND WE ALL AGREED IS NEEDED BUT THIS I THINK GETS US TO THAT SWEET SPOT. OF FOR THE TIME BEING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT WITH THAT. I JUST WANT TO ADD TO THAT BECAUSE THIS COULD BE A VERY EXEMPLARY PROCESS. OF THE VARIOUS INTERESTS THAT HAVE BEEN. TACKLED ON AND I THINK EVERY SINGLE BILL THAT'S GOING TO COME UP THAT HAS TO DO WITH A PRIVACY IN THIS. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY THERE TO FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS TO GET AT THE PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO BE SO I WANT. TO CONGRATULATE THANK YOU ALL.

SO -- WITH THAT WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM. FIFTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO TWO WITNESSES PLEASE. TWO MINUTES EACH. THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR LET ME FIRST BEGIN WITH SOME THANK YOUS THANK YOU FOR SETTING THE SPECIAL ORDER -- AND WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE DEEP ENGAGEMENT THAT YOU HAVE PERSONALLY PUT INTO THIS ISSUE YOUR STAFF HAS A FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'VE DONE ON THIS BILL -- I'M GONNA START BY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AND ALSO TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE BEEN ENGAGE. IN THIS -- THE COALITION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT AS WELL AS OTHERS -- PARTICULAR REPRESENTING THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY WITH HIM WE HAVE DEEPLY ENGAGED. WE ALL KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT WERE IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN STATE HISTORY. WITH INCREDIBLE HOUSING DEMAND OVER THE PAST DECADE THE MEDIAN RENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED BY OVER A THIRD. WHILE MEDIAN INCOME HAS REMAINED FLAT. OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS AND OVER 80% OF LOW INCOME RENTERS ARE RENTBURDEN. PAIN OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD RENTS. FAMILIES WERE MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE EVERY MONTH BETWEEN PAIN FOR ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. WORKING FOR BASIC NECESSITIES. WE'VE ALL READ IN THE PAPERS THAT ARE HOMELESS POPULATIONS ARE INCREASING BY DOUBLE DIGITS ACROSS THE STATE WITHIN THIS PAST YEAR. AN UNCONSCIONABLE FIGURE DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE INABILITY OF MANY INDIVIDUALS TO PAY THE RENT. AND WE HAVE ALL HEARD AND READ TOO MANY STORIES OF TENANTS FACING RAN HIKES. OF 10% 20% 50% A 100%. THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION THERE TO HELP THE BILL. I'M GONNA SCRIBE HALF OF THE BILL GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GRAYSON TO DESCRIBE THE SECOND. SO FIRST OF ALL OF ONE PART OF THE BILL IS AN ANTI RENT GOUGING POLICY IT IS NOT RENT CONTROL. IT'S A POLICY DESIGNED TO PROTECT MOST OF OUR STATES FIFTEEN MILLION TENANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL AGAINST AGREE JUST RENT INCREASES WHILE ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO MAKE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN. IT'S MODELED AFTER A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT IT'S BEEN THE BOOKS FOR A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS THAT HAS PROHIBITED PRICE GOUGING ABOVE 10%. AFTER AN EMERGENCY OR NATURAL DISASTER LIKE A FIRE OR AN EARTHQUAKE. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE ANTI RENT GOUGING POLICY WOULD ESTABLISH A CAP ON ANNUAL RENT INCREASES SET AT 7% PLUS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX INFLATION. WHICH IS GENERALLY TWO AND A HALF 23% A YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF NINE AND A HALF 210% A YEAR. OUR BILL WOULD EXEMPT SOME SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT OVERLY BURDEN IT EXEMPTS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR TEN YEARS SO AS TO NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF NEW HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. AND THIS BILL SUNSETS AND THREE YEARS GIVEN US THE CHANCE TO RE EVALUATE AT THAT TIME. I NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES MY FELLOW JOINT AUTHORS WHO WILL SPEAK TO THE BILL'S OTHER MAIN COMPONENTS. WHICH WERE REQUIRES JUST BECAUSE TO VICTOR TENANTS MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU SIR OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS IF WE COULD. WE WILL BE AN EXPEDITIOUS FABULOUS REMEDY IS MY FRIEND AND I WILL. I WOULD CHOOSE PART A OF OF THE SECOND HALF ANTI GOUGING IS ONE SIDE OF THE TENANT PROTECTION CORNING THE OTHER IS JUST BECAUSE THE FICTION. AB FORTY NEEDED TO REQUIRES A LANDLORD TO LISTED BECAUSE IN THE WRITTEN NOTICE TO TERMINATE A TENDENCY. IF THE TENANT HAS OCCUPIED THE PROPERTY FOR TWELVE MONTHS OR MORE THIS IS THE SENATE -- THIS ISN'T THIS IS ESSENTIAL. AS A PROTECTION BECAUSE IT GUARANTEES DUE PROCESS OF LAW. AND GUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY RETALIATORY OR DISCRIMINATORY EVICTIONS WHILE IT IS LEGAL FOR A LANDLORD TO EVICT SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE IT'S ILLEGAL BECAUSE THEY ARE A MEMBER OF A PROTECTED CLASS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OR BECAUSE THEY FILE A HABIT IT HABITABILITY COMPLAINT. IT IS LEGAL TO EVICT THEM FOR NO CAUSE AT ALL. IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE A SITUATION WHICH A LANDLORD ACTING IN BAD FAITH COULD USE THIS LOOPHOLE TO MASK THE INTENTION BEHIND A TRULY ILLEGAL EVICTION. AND LET'S BE CLEAR THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTENDS THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE GRANTED TO ATTEND IT WAS COVERED UNDER A LEASE AGREEMENT. LISTING OF BECAUSE IN A FICTION IS NOT A BURDEN TO LANDLORDS IT IS THE EXACT STANDARD THAT APPLIES TO THE MAJORITY OF TENANTS IN THE MAJORITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IF INTENDED FAILS TO PAY RENT REACHES THE TERM OF THE LEASE MISTREATS PROPERTY COMMITS REPEATED NUISANCE VIOLATIONS OR CONDUCTS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ON THE PROPERTY THEY CAN BE A VICTIM JUST LIKE UNDER EXISTING LAW. THIS BILL ONLY COVERS A SPECIFIC SITUATION WHERE A LANDLORD DECIDES TO REMOVE IT AND AND CANNOT ARTICULATE A REASON WHY THEY NEED TO DO SO WE ALL AGREE THAT A PERSON SHOULD NOT THE VICTIM OF THE AFFECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER IDENTITY OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WE HAVE A STRONG FOR HOUSING LAW IN PLACE. TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE HARMS BUT ANY PICTURE WITHOUT BECAUSE COMPLETELY NEGATES THE EXISTENCE OF THOSE PROTECTIONS I'D LIKE TO TURN -- THE REST OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND TO EXPLAIN HOW THE HUMAN COST IMPACTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA THE FLOOR SHORES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF. FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES A FEW WORDS BUT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO SPECIFIC TO THAT JUST BECAUSE PROVISIONS PROTECTIONS AGAINST RENT GOUGING. AND UNJUST EVICTIONS GO HAND IN HAND WE NEED. BOTH THERE ARE POLICY PAIR YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER IF WE HAVE JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS ALONE. THEN AGREE JUST RENT INCREASES CAN CAUSE A TEND TO BE UNABLE TO AFFORD RENDON ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A QUOTE UNQUOTE ECONOMIC. EVICTION SIMILARLY STANDALONE RENT AND TAKE OUT IN PROTECTIONS CANNOT HELP KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOME TO THE LANDLORD CAN AFFECT A TENANT FOR ANY REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL SO WE NEED BOTH. AN A. B. FORTY TWO PROVIDES BOTH OF THESE POLICIES SIDE BY SIDE. OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST A SUPPLY PROBLEM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT OUR HOUSING CRISIS HOLISTICALLY IN USE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. TO BRING RELIEF TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE WE CAN STIMULATE SUPPLY AND SUPPORT TENANTS A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT SOLUTION. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOTH THANK YOU THANK YOU TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. HELLO MY NAME IS SASHA GRAHAM AND I'M WITH THE HOUSING NOW COALITION. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WAS LIVING IN A HOME WITH MY SON IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. THAT I HAD BEEN LIVING IN FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS WITHOUT ANY ISSUE. IN MAY OF THAT YEAR THE PROPERTY WAS SOLD TO A NEW OWNER WITHIN A MONTH MY RATE WAS INCREASED OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN ONE FELL SWOOP A HUNDRED AND MY INCOME AND NOT INCREASE BUT I SCRAPE TOGETHER THE MONEY TO PAY THE RENT IN FULL AND ON TIME. BUT EVEN THOUGH THE NEW LAN OR HAD INCREASED MY RANT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. THEY WANT TO SELL THE PROPERTY AND THEY WANT TO FLIP IT. WITHIN TWENTY DAYS THE LANDLORD GAVE ME A NO CALL THE ELECTION TO BE OUT OF OUR HOME WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. AT THAT TIME I WAS EXPERIENCING SEXUAL HARASSMENT MY JOB. AND I WAS FIRED FOR FIGHTING AND DEFENDING BACK DEFENDING MYSELF. EVEN THOSE ABLE TO FIND A JOB WITHIN A MONTH AND A HALF REYES HAD RISEN SO HIGH THAT I CANNOT AFFORD A SECURE. AFFORD A SECURITY DEPOSIT ANYWHERE. MY SON AND I BECAME HOMELESS FOR THREE YEARS. WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN A SAFE AND STABLE CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD ANYTHING MORE. WOULD MOVE FROM COUCH TO COUCH BY CONTINUE TO WORK AND STARTED UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL AT UC BERKELEY. IT WAS TRAUMATIZING. MY SON OF SUFFERS FROM DEEP DEPRESSION FROM HAVING EXPERIENCED SUCH INSTABILITY SO EARLY IN HIS LIFE AND EACH DAY IS A STRUGGLE FOR HIM. IT IS NOT AN OVERSTATEMENT WHEN I SAY THAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO COULD LITERALLY SAVE LIVES. THEY CAN SAY FAMILIES FOR MENTAL ANGUISH AND DESPAIR. IT COULD PROVIDE PHYSICAL SAFETY. WE CAN ALLOW OUR CHILDREN TO GROW UP TO BE THE BEST VERSION OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE TRAUMA OF LOSING A HOME. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT RING DOUSING WE MUST ALSO PROTECT FAMILIES ARE BEING ARBITRARILY EVICTED WHEN THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. HOW'S IT HUMANE THAT WE AS A SOCIETY ALLOW LANDLORDS TO THROW PEOPLE ONTO THE STREETS FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN PROFIT. DOUBLE DIGIT INCREASES OF FAMILIES BECOMING HOMELESS EACH YEAR THE MONETARY COST OUR COMMUNITIES IS EXPONENTIAL. LET ALONE THE MENTAL SPIRITUAL AND EMOTIONAL COSTS THAT THE FAMILIES THEMSELVES ARE GOING THROUGH. THAT I AND MY SON HAVE GONE THROUGH. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PASS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BRYAN ACOSTA ON BEHALF OF EACH ACTION AND A BROAD COALITION OF ORGANIZATIONS WHO ABOUT SPONSORING AND SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. MERGING YOUR ARE YOUR AYE VOTE -- JUNIOR I WROTE ON BEHALF OF THE SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO RENTERS WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE. REASONABLE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND AS THE AUTHORS HAVE DESCRIBED. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A BILL THAT HAS BOTH PROTECTIONS FOR MARIN COUCHING IN PROTECTIONS FROM JUST BECAUSE WE JUST HEARD THE STORY. OF ONE RENTER AND WE HAVE BEHIND US. MANY OTHERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING IMPACTS OF FOR LACK OF PROTECTIONS IN THIS AREA. IN THIS JUST BECAUSE PIECES SO CRITICAL BECAUSE IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW THE LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS. FOR A FICTION. THE LOOPHOLE THAT IS A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS A FICTION BASED ON RETALIATION. BASED ON DISCRIMINATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE COUPLE WHO GIVES BIRTH TO CHILDREN WHO GROW INTO A FAMILY WHO WERE SUDDENLY FIND AND NO CAUSE OF ACTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE YOUNG. MAN WHO BECOMES A TEENAGER AND SUDDENLY THE MANAGER DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HIS FRIEND'S LOCKER TALKING ABOUT. THE NEW OWNER WHO BUYS THE PROPERTY AND WANTS TO QUOTE CHANGE THE COMPLEXION OF THE OF THE OF THE COMPLEX. FOR THE TENANT WHO COMPLAINS TOO MUCH THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY'RE NOT PROTECTED FROM EXTREME RENT INCREASES THIS BILL WILL DO BOTH AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ORIGINALLY ABOUT.

AND THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE PEOPLE WITH THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. LET ME FIRST START BY SAYING THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT OWNERS WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. BY THEIR TENANTS WOULD VIOLATE THE STANDARDS HERE SET FORTH IN THIS BILL EVEN THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE 5% WE DON'T BELIEVE OWNERS WOULD VIOLATE THAT STANDARD. IN OUR BIGGEST CONCERN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT WE DON'T MAKE A BAD PROBLEM WORSE BY SCARING OFF DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT BALANCE AND WE WANT STABILITY. WE NEED PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS. WHEN IT COMES TO ENCOURAGING NEW CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPPLY IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE TENANTS? WE DON'T WANT TO SCARE OFF DEVELOPMENT WE DON'T WANT DEVELOPERS TO GO TO OTHER STATES. UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT CALIFORNIA BASED MEMBERSHIP AND BUILDERS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED THAT IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TODAY I WAS PLANNING TO HAVE A SPEAKER WITH ME HOWEVER. SHE TOOK HER BUILDINGS TO TEXAS. WHEN WE HAD TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS MOVED TO TEXAS EIGHT HUNDRED HAVE MOVED TO UTAH AND ELEVEN HUNDRED HAVE MOVED TO COLORADO AND NEVADA TO START THEIR PLANNING PROCESS THERE? WITH ORGANS IN NEW ADOPTION OF ITS 7% CAP AND ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THEY MAY GO LOWER. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A 38% DECLINE IN MULTI FAMILY INVESTMENT OVER THIS ONE YEAR PERIOD. WE CAN'T LET CITIES OFF THE HOOK PLACING BLAME ON LANDLORDS IS CERTAINLY THE EASY ANSWER. BUT BY PROVIDING PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR BIGGEST. UNRESOLVED CHALLENGES IN THE STATE WE'VE ALREADY REJECTED SOME VERY IMPORTANT BILLS IN THIS LEGISLATURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DECLINING HOUSING GIVING IN TO NAME BE OPPOSITION. WE NEED TO LINK AB FORTY NEEDED TO TO HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO SET A STATE WIDE CAP. WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR TO BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS THIS IS OUR NEW STANDARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TEN AYE PLEASE CLOSE. THANK YOU. TWO MINUTES PLEASE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE A SHELF CAPITAL ADVOCACY HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION CALORIE CHAIR PRESENTS ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PROPERTY OWNERS OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNITS STATEWIDE. ASSOCIATION BEEN UP OF SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE PROPERTY OWNERS ALTHOUGH SMALL MEDIUM MAKE ABOUT COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON EFECTIVE SOLUTIONS IN A BALANCED APPROACH. BUT WE DON'T FEEL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS A BALANCED APPROACH WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE JUST BECAUSE POLICY HAS BEEN AMENDED INTOTHE BILL AND WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT JUST BECAUSE BILLS FAILED TO PASS BUT THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR DURING HOUSE. OF ORIGIN DEADLINE WE'RE NOT NEED ACTION BUSINESS IT'S EXPENSIVE AND IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING THE CURRENT EVICTION PROCESS TAKES ON AVERAGE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS IN COSTS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE IN LEGAL FEES. UNDER JUST BECAUSE WE CANNOT EASILY REMEDY THE SITUATION FOR GOOD TENANTS WHAT OTHER TENANTS VIOLATED THE LEASE AGREEMENT FEELING TO PAY RENT FREE NUISANCES OR CONDUCTING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THIS HURTS GOOD TENANTS% AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT COME OUT OF THE BILL. WELL WE APPRECIATE THE BILL WITH THE MEN FROM CPI PLUS FIVE TO SEE TÁI PLUS 7% THERE ARE SEVERAL CRITICAL ELEMENTS WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS. FIRST EXEMPTION FOR OWNERS OF TEN SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES ONLY SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO ALL OWNERS INCLUDING LLC'S ARE TRUSTS AND ALL PROPERTY TYPES INCLUDING UNITS. EXEMPTION OWNER OF TEN HOMES WHO'S DOING QUITE WELL WELL FORCING OWNERS OF DUPLEXES OR FOR PLEXUS TO COMPLY WITH THE COURT REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL WE BELIEVE IS UNJUST POLICY. SECOND WHEN IT COMES TO MARKET IMPACTS AND MAKING SURE WE ARE HUNGRY NEW CONSTRUCTION WE'D LIKE TO SEE A TEN YEAR OLD AN EXEMPTION IS CURRENTLY IN THE BILL FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO BE EXPANDED. SO THAT WE DON'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE HOUSING SUPPLYING CALIFORNIA WORK WE'VE ALSO DISCUSSED MEANS TESTING WITH REGARD TO RELOCATION FEES AS A MORE BALANCED SOLUTION. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SHOULD BECOME TO DEAL WITH SENATE'S CRITICAL FOR OUR MEMBERS OF C. COMES A STATEWIDE STANDARD BY ESTABLISHING PREEMPTION ONA GO FORWARD BASIS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THE STABILITY IN THE FORM OF A CONSTITUTIONAL. CONCURRENT AMENDMENT SO WE DON'T FACE THE THREAT OF HAVING THE PERCENTAGE ROGER DOWN YEAR AFTER YEAR WITHOUT YOUR POST ABOUT THANK YOU.

NEXT WITNESS I'M SURE MEMBERS RAND MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO MAKE IT STRONGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO I DARE ASK. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OUR TO WE ARE ARE YOU HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION LET'S BRING IT BACK. TO THE DYESS -- CLEARLY AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN AND PASSION ON BOTH SIDES NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I'VE BEEN A LANDLORD I'VE BEEN A TENANT I KNOW THIS. FROM BOTH ANGLES IF IT WERE ONLY TRUE THAT ALL LAND WERE LORDS WERE GOOD PEOPLE -- AND MANY ARE. BUT WE DO HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE AND WE NEED TO BALANCE HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS IT I BELIEVE LANDLORDS SHOULD HAVE ROOM. TO OPERATED A REASONABLE PROFIT AND SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT CONTROL OVER THEIR PROPERTIES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OUT BAD TENANTS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DISAGREES WITH THAT. I THINK THEY IT THIS BILL AS AMENDED AS YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN -- GIVES LANDLORDS -- PLENTY OF ROOM TO REYES FRANCE SOME MIGHT ARGUE TOO MUCH ROOM. WE HAVE TO HER RECOGNIZE TO PEOPLE ARE HURTING IN OUR ECONOMY HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW IS NO JOKE IT'S GETTING WORSE -- I WAS COMPELLED BY THE TESTIMONY THIS WOMAN TO WORK HARD TO MAINTAIN A STABLE HOME FOR HERSELF AND HER SON -- I KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SENIORS. WHO ARE HOMELESS NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE DRUG ADDICTED OR OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BUT THERE THAT ONE PAYCHECK AWAY THEY CAN'T MAKE THE RANT THE RAIN GETS INCREASED? AND THERE HOMELESS AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON THE STREETS AND WE ALL HAVE TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES OF HELPING THOSE PEOPLE MAINTAIN A BASIC. LEVEL OF HUMAN DIGNITY -- SO IT'S CLEARLY A CRISIS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT. LANDLORDS CAN STILL -- GET RID OF PROBLEM TENANTS -- THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY TO GET RID OF A TENER DOESN'T PAY THE RENT -- TO IS A IT SUFFICIENTLY DISRUPTIVE OF THE OF THE A HOME IN THE AREA IN WHICH THEY'RE LIVING -- THE JUST BECAUSE CONTINUES FOR EXACTLY THE SAME AS ITS EXISTING GROUNDS. OF FAILURE TO PAY RENT BREACH OF LEAST COMMITTING WASTE CAUSING A NUISANCE. IN OTHER WORDS UNDER THIS BILL LANDLORDS WILL. ABSOLUTELY BE ABLE TO GET RID OF BAD TENANTS -- I THINK THE U. AT THE EXEMPTIONS ARE PRUDENT SMALL TIME MOM AND POP LANDLORDS ARE GENERALLY LEFT OUT IN RECENT CONSTRUCTION IS ALSO LEFT OUT WHICH I THINK. ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- PEOPLE NOT BUILDING THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING MULTI FAMILY. HOMES AND APARTMENTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES BY THE WAY HAS TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL TAX LAW. BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN WE TOOK AWAY THE X. CELEBRATED DEPRECIATION. SCHEDULE IT TOOK OUT A HUGE AMOUNT OF THE PROFIT THAT BUILDERS AND CONSTRUCTION WOULD HAVE AND WE SAW A HUGE DROP IN THE NUMBER THESE HOMES THAT WERE BUILT SO. I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY ONE ISSUE -- BUT THERE ARE SERIES OF THEM AND PERHAPS -- WE CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AT SOME POINT BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR BILL TODAY SO I I SUPPORT THE BILL I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. OF EVERYBODY HERE I APOLOGIZE FOR AND CUT YOU OFF BUT WE DO. TWO THIRTY AND I'VE GOT NOW FORTY FOUR OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE TO DO BEFORE MIDNIGHT TONIGHT I GUESS -- BUT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AND THEN -- WE WILL. TAKE A A MOTION IF THAT IS SO -- DESIRED. SENATOR GONZALEZ -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS YOU KNOW A LARGE CITY LIKE LONG BEACH -- TO RIGHT BEFORE I LEFT THE COUNCIL BROUGHT FORWARD A RELOCATION ASSISTANCE ORDINANCE TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS THAT WERE IN THE DOWNTOWN LONG BEACH AREA BECAUSE WE DID HAVE A LOT OF THE INCREASES. IN RENTS BECAUSE OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND MUCH OF THIS BILL LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN LONG BEACH WHICH I APPRECIATE BUT EVEN WITH -- MORE NARROW RESTRICTIONS AND AFTER LOOKING AT THIS BILL I MEAN A SIMILAR TO WHAT SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED YOU KNOW THREE YEARS SUNSET. NO FALL AN AT FAULT -- INCLUSIONS ADD EXEMPTION ON NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ESSENTIALLY -- OWNERS CAN. INCREASE THEIR RENTS BY TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT STILL IT'S IT'S STILL ALLOWABLE WITH THIS BILL. SO WITH THAT SAID I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU -- FOR ALL OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE COME OUT ON BOTH SIDES THE ONLY THIG I HATE ABOUT THIS BILLS THAT OFTENTIMES IT GETS DIVISIVE. AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS ACTUALLY PROTECTS -- RENTERS AND ALSO LANDLORDS -- TOO MANY EXTENSIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYTHING ELSE CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEITH. A QUESTION ON THE TEN UNITS SOME IN SECTION TO THE BILL AS I READ IT IT'S TEN UNITS BUT IT'S ONLY SINGLE FAMILY HOUSES THERE'S NO DUPLEXES OR ANY OTHER. CONFIGURATION TO GET. TO TEN THAT'S CORRECT THIS WAS -- IN PART A NEGOTIATED UNDERSTANDING WITH THE REALTORS -- WITH THE CONCEPTUAL AGREEMENT WE HAD FROM THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AGAIN WE ARE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE REST OF THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY -- BUT WE HAVE NOT YET GONE THERE. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD BE A DISCUSSION THAT YOU COULD CONTINUE HAVING. OUR AND SO WITH THAT IS OUR MOTION. ALL RIGHT -- CENTER AKOWSKI MOVES -- JUST ONE PERSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. BUT ME FIRST START BY JUST THANKING ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- LIKE CENTER GONZALEZ FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I KNOW EVERYONE WHO COMES TO THIS ISSUE COMES. FROM A GOOD LEGITIMATE PLACE AND AND OUR HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WE CAN STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE -- BUT IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY OUR TENANTS NEED RELIEF AND WE THINK THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT BOTH PROTECTS TENANTS -- WITH -- JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE MOST EGREGIOUS RENT INCREASES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE ABILITY OF LANDLORDS TO MAKE A HEALTHY PROFIT -- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US IN THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN SENDING YOU DEVELOPMENT SO THAT'S WHY WE HAD EXEMPTION UP FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION OF TEN YEARS -- AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM CA THAT WE HEARD THAT -- THEY BELIEVE THAT MANY THEIR MEMBERS WOULD NOT VIOLATE. THESE RULES AND AND AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER TESTAMENT THAT WE'VE HAD IT DOWN THE MIDDLE SO. WITH THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING THE RENT IS TOO HIGH AND IT VERY MUCH ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. VERY GOOD. ALRIGHT MADAM SECRETARY WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS. IN THE TWO AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU FOLKS FOR THIS IS I KNOW BUT NOT ABOUT SLOG BUT IT IT'S IMPORTANT WE GOTTA FIND THIS BALANCE HERE.

FILE ITEM [inaudible] THREE EIGHTY FOUR AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE NO AMENDMENTS. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO FORWARD PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD BRING HEALTH INFORMATION COLLECTED BY FDA APPROVED APPS THAT ARE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF A PHYSICIAN. TO BE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL PRIVACY LAW. THE FDA HAS RECENTLY STREAMLINED THE PROCESS BY WHICH DIGITAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE APPROVED GIVING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW WAYS TO GET USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE FDA HAS APPROVED A DIGITAL AND MOBILE CONNECTED INHALER THAT CAN DETECT WHEN THE DEVICE IS USED MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF THE USERS AND ELATION AND TRANSMIT THIS INFORMATION TO THE USER'S DOCTOR. ALSO SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL PILLS ALREADY IN USE THESE BILLS COMBINE IN JUST DOUBLE MICROCHIP SENSORS WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE PATCH THAT COLLECTS INFORMATION AND SINCE IT. TO AN APP SIMILAR TO A FITBIT. IT CAN RECORD WHEN IN IN WHAT QUANTITY A TRUCK IS CONSUME THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE PERSON TAKING THE DRUGS SUCH AS TEMPERATURE. ALL ACTIVITY LEVEL AND HEART RATE HOWEVER IN ORDER FOR THIS KIND OF DATA TO BE CONSIDERED A MEDICAL INFORMATION IN NORMALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. INFORMATION GENERATED OR COLLECTED BY DIGITAL HEALTH OUT MEETING AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL FACILITY WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION. THIS BILL EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WILL BRING THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT. UNDER CMI EIGHT BY PROVIDING THAT ANY BUSINESS THAT OFFERS SUCH AN APPLICATION WHAT THE VICE TO CONSUMERS SHALL BE A PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA IS TREATED THE SAME. WITH THE SAME CARE AND AS STATED THAT IS GENERATED IN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL SETTING AND PROHIBIT THAT INFORMATION FROM BEING SURE WITHOUT A PATIENT'S -- WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M CAN MORE MONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION UNFORTUNATELY RECENT MOMENTS HAVE INTRODUCED SOME UNCERTAINTY SO WE REQUEST AMENDMENTS TO RETURN TO OUR FORMER SUPPORT THANK YOU THIS ORDER. SUCH AS I UNDERSTOOD A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THIS MOST MANAGER UNLESS THAT'S FINE TOO ALL OF IRAQ OR THE CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION KIND OF BETWEEN HER POSITION -- WHICH REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS IS A PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND IN THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE STAFF THEY WERE VERY HARD. TO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS YOU MAY REMEMBER THIS BILL FROM LAST YEAR IT'S BEEN A TWO YEAR PROCESS -- WERE VERY HAPPY WITH THE DIRECTION THE BILL'S GOING WE THINK THAT THE DATA DERIVED FROM SOME OF THESE MEDICAL DEVICES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. AS PART OF A PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD IS PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN IS PARTY OF COURSE OF TREATMENT -- THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO HANDLE IT SO WITH THAT THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND LESS THAN TWO MINUTES. PERFECT. NEXT WITNESS FEELING GRIEVES THE ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO ONE EXTEND OUR THANKS TO THE AUTHOR AND STAFF FOR ALL THE GREAT WORK ON THE BILL SO FAR. THAT WERE REMAINING OPPOSES NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY WE PER FOR A FEDERAL APPROACH THERE IS ADDITIONAL HEALTH INITIATIVE HAPPENING FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE RECENTLY INTRODUCED PIECE OF LEGISLATION CONGRESS. WOULD EXPAND PROTECTIONS AHEAD BUT TO DIGITAL HEALTH APPS BUT AS WE ALL KNOW CONGRESS DOES NOT GET A LOT OF WORK DONE SO -- WITH THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED BUT THAT THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR ALL THE GREAT WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHEN ANYTHING. GOOD WILL HAPPEN OUT OF WASHINGTON SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS.

ODDS AND HAVE A HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCARCERATION. THESE YOU HAVE FEWER PEOPLE TO TURN TO THAT CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED -- TO THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SB EIGHT NINETY NINE BY LOU ESTABLISH THE FALSE FOR YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS AND WE THINK THE SENATOR. FOR DOING SUCH -- AND REQUIRING A SOCIAL WORKERS TO NOTIFY FOSTER YOUTH OF THESE RIGHTS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I AUTHORS ONLY BE ON TEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND UPDATES PROVISIONS TO THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS AND NOW. THROUGH AB ONE SEVENTY FIVE WE ARE MOVING LANGUAGE THAT IS A RESULT. AND THAT WORKS THAT THE WORKGROUP HAVE COME HAVE COME UP WITH -- AND HAVE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM THE S. S. THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHTS TO GROOMING. HYGIENE PRODUCTS THAT RESPECTS THE AND ALSO RESPECT THE YOUTH OF THE CHILD'S CULTURE AND GENDER IDENTITY AND TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO THE INTERNET. TO BE CONSISTENT WHICH CHILDREN ATTEND THAT PARTICULAR AGE -- MATURITY AND DEVELOPMENT LEVELS AMONG OTHERS IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE REASONABLE -- A PARENTAL PARENTS -- ASSIST GUIDANCE IS WILL BE ALSO BE PART OF THAT THE TICKET OF A FAMILY HOMES AND LICENSE FOR FOSTER YOUTH. HOMES. REASONABLE. TO HAVE THE CHILD TO WANT TO BE ABLE UNDERSTAND -- WHAT THE ACCESS ACTUALLY MEANS THIS BILL -- IS IT RIGHT FOR OUR YOUTH -- AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUTH ARE RESPECTED AND ALSO THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND HERE TO WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES.

ONE SEVENTY FIVE LIKELY NO -- THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS CREATED ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO A LOT HAS HAPPENED WITHIN EIGHTEEN YEARS. TIMES HAVE CHANGED CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED AND SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT WITH THOSE CHANGES THE LAWS CHANGED TO AND WE-UPDATE THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS. THESE UPDATES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE. PROVIDING PROPER -- HAIR CARE PRODUCTS -- BEING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE OF THESE RIGHTS IS THE RIGHT TO THE CHILD CAN BE CALLED WHICHEVER NAME THEY PLEASE. THIS IS ABU APPLICABLE TO ME BECAUSE MY LEGAL NAME IS JUST STEAM KIANA AREN'T BURKE. I GO BY MY NEW MIDDLE NAME KIANA BECAUSE FROM MY HISPANIC FAMILY THEY ALL GO BY THEIR MIDDLE NAMES JUST TRADITION.

THAT'S HOW SOMEONE UP HERE IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION RIGHT. GRAB A SEAT. LET'S SEE I THINK SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP THE SEAT VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DENISE PERSIA AND I'M A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO EMANCIPATED FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THOUGH I COULD NOT RETURN TO MY PARENTS HOME AFTER EMANCIPATION I WAS OFTEN HUNGRY THOUGH IT WAS NEVER HOMELESS. I WAS ALSO INVOLVED I WAS NEVER ALSO INVOLVED IN SEX TRAFFICKING AND FOR THIS REASON I CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THE LUCKY FEW. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN A REPORT ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL. OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM SOCIAL SERVICES COURTS IN CHILD ADVOCACY GROUPS EXPLAINED IN PART THAT THE FEELINGS OF THE CHILD WELFARE IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS WITH REGARD TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE ARE TOO FULL. ONE THE CHILDREN WHO PRAY TO WHO ARE PRETTY TO EXPLOITERS OR SEX TRAFFICKERS WERE FREQUENTLY CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN PRIOR INVOLVED WITH. CHILD WELFARE SERVICES AND ACCORDING TO VARIOUS STUDIES INCLUDING THE JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN FOUND A WHOPPING WERE AT SOME POINT PLACED IN FOSTER CARE SOME STILL A STUDIES ESTIMATE UPWARDS OF 88% OF FOSTER CHILDREN ARE SEX TRAFFICKING TO TODAY. THE AVERAGE AGE OF A SEX TRAFFIC TO GET DIVERT REPORTED MISSING TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING EXPLOITED CHILDREN IS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE CHOOSE ME COULD I ASK YOU JUST TO GET TO THE TO THE POINT REGARDING THE BILL. IF YOU WOULD FOSTER CARE CHILDREN ARE INHERENTLY ON TRUSTING THINK ABOUT IT. FOSTER CHILDREN DO NOT TRUST ANY ADULTS CERTAINLY NOT ANY FOSTER PARENT NO MATTER HOW WONDERFUL THOSE PEOPLE ARE. OR ANY OTHER PERSON CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM THIS SHOULDN'T BE TOO SURPRISING AS THE DOTS IN THEIR LIFE INCLUDING THEIR PARENTS WERE NOT TRUSTWORTHY. INSTEAD OF THIS BILL BEING THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS THIS BILL SHOULD BE TITLED NOBODY'S CHILD. YOU SAY YOU WERE CREATING A FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS AND I HAVE MY DOUBTS THAT CAN EVER BE DONE. AS RIGHTS DO NOT COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT OR LEGISLATORS OR BILLS. WHY DO I SAY THAT WILL YOU SEE THE CHILD IS THE PLACE TO BE PLACED IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE POSSIBLE SETTING REGARDLESS OF AGE THANK YOU AS A LOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR IS THAT RESTRICTIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOSTER PARENT WITNESSED NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES EACH? TWO MINUTES SIR. PLACE. YOUR MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. JUST ONE HIGHLIGHTS MORE CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE ALL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THERE IS IS THERE TO PROTECT KIDS FROM BEING EXPLOITED AND ABUSED. AND TO PROVIDE A NURTURING ENVIRONMENT WERE FOSTER PARENTS CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN THINKING ABOUT THESE NEW RIGHTS FOR FOSTER CARE KIDS? THINK OF THEM IN RELATION TO YOUR OWN CHILDREN WOULD YOU WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THESE RIGHTS TO YOUR KIDS. POSSIBLE A COUPLE RIGHTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RIGHT TO THE INTERNET TO MAKE IN SEND AND RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL PHONE CALLS ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS EMAILS TEXTING. SNAIL MAIL. TO I REMEMBER WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS ELEVEN AND SHE WANTED TO GET ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE FOR THOSE WHO LOVED GUINEA PIGS. SEEM LIKE AN INNOCENT ENOUGH WEBSITE AND SO WE HAD MEN FROM AROUND THE WORLD REACHING OUT TO HER WANTING TO BE HER FRIEND. GOOD PARENTS OVERSEE WHO IS COMMUNICATING WITH THEIR KIDS. THIS BILL PREVENTS THAT. THE RIGHT AT ANY AGE TO GET ACCESS THE COMP CONTRACEPTION ABORTION SEXUAL SOLD HEALTH CARE WITH OUT. THE CONSENT OF ANY ADULT. WHEN I WORK FOR A CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY? I VISITED A GROUP FOSTER HOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THEY HAD WITH TRAFFICKERS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO RECRUIT AND FORCE FOSTER KIDS INTO PROSTITUTION. IF THESE KIDS GET SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR THEY'RE FORCED TO GET AN ABORTION BY THEIR TRAFFICKER THIS BILL PROTECTS THE PREDATOR FROM GETTING FOUND OUT. AND LASTLY THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES OF PERSONAL BELONGINGS I'M NOT SURE HOW ON REASONABLE IS DEFINED HERE BUT GOOD PARENTS. MONITOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THEIR OWN HOUSE. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WITH DRUGS OR WEAPONS ARE HIDING IN ROOMS THAT PROTECTS EVERYONE. IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHOR THIS BILL DOESN'T WANT FOSTER PARENTS TO GUIDE TO PROTECT KIDS. AS MUCH AS HE WANTS FOSTER CARE PARENTS SIMPLY HOUSE THEM VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF THAT PLEASE STEP FOR WITH NAME AND AFFILIATION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO YOU -- TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON A PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS WE ADDRESS THE THE SITUATION WITH PARENTAL BEHAVIOR. AND THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS. IN OBSERVING THE RIGHTS UNDER THIS PROVISION FOSTER PARENTS MUST ALSO BE MINDFUL OF THEIR DUTY TO MEET. THE REASONABLE AND PRUDENT PERRANCE STANDARD SO IF SOMETHING IS REASONABLE AND PRUDENT FOR A PARENT TO DO -- THESE THAT IS THE PROTECTED IT IS THINGS THAT ARE UNREASONABLE SO I THINK SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES ARE THINGS THAT ARE CERTAINLY REASONABLE PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND THOSE ARE INCLUDED. THE BILL ALSO SAYS THAT THE SECTION DOESN'T REQUIRE NOR SHALL IT BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE. A FOSTER CARE PROVIDER TO TAKE ANY ACTION THAT WOULD IMPAIR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT SO I THINK THAT ADDRESSES. OF BOTH THOSE ISSUES -- BUT IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT THE CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVE BY SENATOR RUSSELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR POINTING OUT THE REASONABLE -- AND PRUDENT PARENTS STANDARDS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO COME BACK WITH AND I'M JUST A TAKEN BACK BY THE WITNESSES COMMENTS BY ST ARE YOU THE NOT TRUSTWORTHY. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE I'M TRAUMATIZED BY BEING IN A IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO COME INTO A NEED TO COME INTO A LOVING HOME WITH A LOVING STRUCTURE -- WE SHOULD NOT BE REJECTING -- CHILDREN -- BECAUSE OF THAT AND SO -- YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD PHRASE LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS MYSELF I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE.

YOUR MESSAGE TODAY FOR THE CITY OF ALAMEDA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WELL GREAT YOU GOT UP YOUR VERY FAST THANK YOU SO MUCH TWO MINUTES EACH AND IF YOU TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BEFORE US SAID BE MOST HELPFUL. SURE -- MY NAME IS DR MARYANN COSBY AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA IN A HAS SUPPORTED THE CONCEPTS OF ALTERNATIVE DESTINATION AND COMMUNITY PARA MEDICINE PROJECTS FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WERE OPPOSED TO THEM. WE OFTEN STOOD ALONE IN SUPPORT OF HIGH QUALITY INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE IN PRE HOSPITAL CARE AS WELL AS THE OTHER COLLABORATIONS IMAGE AMONG OTHER EMERGENCY CARE PROVIDERS. HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY UNDERMINE THESE EFFORTS BY CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF THE EMS COMMISSION EVERY MOVE OUR SEAT AT THE TABLE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO OFFER OUR GUIDANCE AND EXPERTISE ON A VARIETY OF EMERGENCY CARE ISSUES WHETHER INVOLVE STROKES ARE IN MY REGULATIONS OR OTHERS AND HOW TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL DESTINATION FOR TREATING VICTIMS. THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO AMEND THE BILL TO REMOVE THE PROVISION THAT WOULD ELIMINATE OUR ROLE IN THE EMS COMMISSION. HOWEVER SINCE IS PREVENTION PROVISION HAS NOT BEEN REMOVED WE OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION. THE CURRENT VERSION OF AB FIFTEEN FORTY FOUR COMPLETELY ELIMINATES THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES SEAT AT THE EMS COMMISSION A POSITION WE HAVE HELD. SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AS THE PREMIER EMERGENCY NURSING ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD REMOVE OUR VOICE FROM THE COMMISSION. IAN A ADVICE IS THE COMMISSION ON EVIDENCE $ED PRE HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT CARE REGARDLESS OF WHO ELSE IS ON THE COMMISSION. THERE WILL BE NO PERSON WITH GREATER EXPERTISE REGARDING EMERGENCY NURSING THAN THE AND A MEMBER THAT IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE ARE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION WHO WORKS TO EDUCATE AND ADVOCATE FOR SAFE PRACTICE AND SAFE PATIENT CARE. AS AN INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION IN OVER FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA OUR VOICE ON THE COMMISSION FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP OUR SEAT AND WE RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST THAT YOU OPPOSE THE BILL IN THE CURRENT FORM AND EXCEEDED RESTORE THE BORDERS OF EMERGENCY THANK YOU VERYMUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT NEXT WITNESS MADAM MADAM CHAIR MEMBER STEPHANIE ROBERSON ON BEHALF OF HE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND RESPECT OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- TO YOU -- THE AUTHOR HAD STATED A SITUATION WHERE PARAMEDICS AND EMTS OPERATE IN THE PRE HOSPITAL SPACE WE'RE LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT PARAMEDICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DESIGNATED TO TELL YOUR LOVED ONES YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER YOUR GROUND SIGN WHETHER OR NOT THEY GET TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE THE EXPECTATION RIGHT NOW IS PATIENTS GO TO THE HOSPITAL GET TRIAGE AND THEY GET SENT ELSEWHERE THIS WOULD LITERALLY FLIP THAT ON ITS HEAD SO I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THIS IS LITERALLY PARAMEDICS IS MAKING THE DECISION THAT NURSES AND DOCTORS MAKE RIGHT NOW AS TO WHERE PATIENTS AGO. YOU KNOW ON PATIENT SAFETY I JUST WANNA STATE REALLY QUICKLY THERE THERE HAVE BEEN OVER THIRTEEN RESEARCH STUDIES THAT FOUND SIGNIFICANT RATES OF UNDER TRIAGE BY EMS PERSONNEL RATES AS HIGH AS 32%. ON THE TRANSPORT OF PATIENTS TO ALTERNATE DESTINATIONS AND I WANT EVERYONE TO REMEMBER THAT PATIENTS WHO CALL 911- OR MORE LIKELY TO BE CRITICALLY ILL AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. THIS IS A MUCH MORE SECURE POPULATION OF PATIENTS THAT COME BY AMBULANCE AND AT THE END OF IT ALL AGAIN WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF PARAMEDICS WHO WE WORK WITH THEM EVERY DAY. THE TREMENDOUS WORK THEY ARE REVEALED WE VEERED IN THIS BUILDING AND RIGHTFULLY SO BUT THE SHOULD NOT BE OPERATING IN THE SPACE AND TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WHAT SHOULD BE BEFORE. PARTICULAR COMMITTEES THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE IN P. THIS IS A SCOPE OF PRACTICE BILL WE FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE. ORGANIZATION HAS LOOKED AT THESE PILOTS FOR SIX YEARS SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS BILL WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE DATA AND THE DATA THAT WE HAVE COMPILED DOES NOT. STATE THAT THIS SHOULD BE PUBLIC POLICY STATEWIDE AND WE ARE A DATA DRIVEN ORGANIZATION WERE SO I IN SPACE WERE NURSES YOU ARE SOME OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE THIS BUILDING WE LOOK AT DATA BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE SOLUTION. AND THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE LOOKING AT POPULATIONS WHERE THEY DIDN'T TAKE UP. YOU KNOW ON SOME OF THESE PILOTS ON NOT A SIGNIFICANT COHORT OF FOLKS WE'RE LOOKING AT ENGLISH BY SPEAKING MALES NOT REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA SENATE IN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH RESPECT LIMIT OPPOSE FOR HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU IF YOU THAT THIS IS BILL MOVES FOR THANK YOU. VERY VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD PLEASE. BRING A BRASS HERE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH SERVICES AT HOME WHERE POLICE RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE NEW AMENDMENT LANGUAGE AND WILL BE LOOKING AT THE BILL THAT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE PLEASE STEP FORWARD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ME DATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- AND WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW AMENDMENTS THE SPONSOR AND AUTHOR OF WORKED VERY HARD WITH US THE COUNTIES YOU ON THIS BILL -- ONCE WE SEE THEM AND PRINT A FEW SMALL ISSUES BUT AGAIN -- WE ARE STILL OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MADAM CHAIR -- BETSEY ARMSTRONG ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION AND THE MS ADMINISTRATORS I'D LIKE. OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT AS A SIGN MY COMMENTS WITH MY COUNTY COLLEGE THANK YOU SO MUCH MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU MADAM CHARGING HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME POSITION AS HE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND JOHN ARE YOUNGER WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PARAMEDIC FOUNDATION OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OUR BRING THIS. OR DO YOU WANT TO COME FORWARD. I APOLOGIZE MAN CHAIR FOR BEING LATE BUT THE UNITED FIREFIGHTERS OF LOS ANGELES CITY PROBABLY -- SUPPORT THIS I'M I'M SORRY FOR BEING LATE BUT OR NO PROBLEM THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN TODAY I'LL BE VERY HAPPY. WITH THAT LET'S BRING THIS BACK TO THE DIET SO OF ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED. TO KEEP THIS VERY LIMITED IS THIS IS A BATTLE BETWEEN TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE I ADORE. AND IT'S IT'S BEEN A QUOTE UNQUOTE TURF BATTLE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME -- YOU KNOW THE THE NURSING PROFESSION IS. IT IN MY OPINION HAVING HAD TO GO THROUGH EXPERIENCES WITH LOVE ONE'S GOING TO THEIR ILLNESSES AND ALL I JUST THINK. THE NURSES ARE THE GREATEST OF UNSUNG HEROES AS ARE THE EMTS IN THE FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THROUGH MANY. OF THOSE EXPERIENCES PERSONALLY AS WELL AND I SUSPECT MANY OF US HAVE SO -- THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING WERE TAKEN IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE I DO HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH I HAVE TO DEVIATE JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM MY CONCERN ABOUT LIABILITY ONLY. THE REPORTS THE DATA SHOWING THAT DAD -- EMTS MAY HAVE UNDER SERVED PEOPLE OR WHAT WAS THE WORD UNDER -- UNDER A PRESCRIBED OR TREATED UNDER TREATED. A PEOPLE WITH A AFTER NINE ONE ONE CALLS. CAN YOU RESPOND TO THE DATA ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONS SAFETY IS REALLY PARA MODELING ALL OF US AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A QUESTION THAT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO MY MEMBERS AS WELL. AND IF AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO HAS BEEN THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATOR THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. IF YOU REVIEW EVERY REPORT THEY WILL THEY WILL ASSERTIVELY AND AFFIRMATIVELY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN ZERO ADVERSE PATIENT OUTCOMES. THE REASON FOR AUSTIN PILOTS IS TO TEST THESE INNOVATIVE MODELS AND I THINK THEY'VE PROVEN OUT ITS THEY'VE DEMONSTRATED THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL. AND WE ARE NOT OPERATING IN THE FIELD ABSENT THE DIRECTION OF PHYSICIANS THAT'S HOW WE OPERATE NOW IS PARAMEDICS WE DO NOT DO A SINGLE INTERVENTION IN THE FIELD WITHOUT. THE EITHER THE STANDING ORDERS OR THE ORDER THAT WE RECEIVE WE CALL A BASE HOSPITAL IN AN EMERGENCY SETTING IN THAT. SCENARIO IS UNCHANGED HERE THEY HAD ALSO PATIENTS. ELECT TO BE TRANSPORTED SOMEWHERE ELSE IT IS NOT A MANDATORY TRANSPORT SO IF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO COME BACK AND RESPOND TO THAT AND THEN I PROMISE CENTER WHY BECAUSE HE WILL GET BACK TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. WHICH IS THE LIABILITY ISSUE THAT IS WHAT IS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- WOULD YOU READ DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE MADAM CHAIR HEALTH SIDE OF THAT THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW THAT'S FINE AND MOM AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THE REPORTS THAT -- MRS MOMMA HAD. POINTED TO FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS THE ISSUE FOR US IS. IN ORDER TO KNOW IF A PROGRAM IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RAW DATA. RAW DATA AS YOU ALL KNOW IS THE DATA THE WRONG NUMBERSYET BY RESEARCHER BEFORE UNDERGOES ANY TYPE OF STATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WE DON'T HAVE THAT SO MY QUESTION IS AND WE VAST UCSF FOR SIX YEARS WHERE'S THE RAW DATA THEY WILL GIVE IT TO US WHY. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE HIDING WILL BE ON THE RECORD BE SET IT WE SENT SEVERAL REPORTS OF FOR US. AND TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW HOW THESE PILOTS HAVE BEEN UNDER USE. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US STATE OF NEW MEXICO PULLED OUT OF THIS PILOT PROJECT THE END OF THE DAY IT DIDN'T SAVE MONEY. IT DIDN'T PROVIDE SAFE PATIENT CARE THAT TO ME SAYS YOU OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES DO THEY PULLED OUT OF THIS. THANK YOU SO MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S STILL A PILOT -- THERE THERE IS A TERMINATION DATE AND IT'S MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT WE GET THAT DATA SO WE CAN. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT BEEN MADE AVAILABLE BILL LET'S ASSUME THAT WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE AND CHAIR MASS THIS ROBESON ROVER SEND IF SHE AGREES WITH THE LIMITED JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FACT THAT THE LIABILITY. REMAINS THE SAME IN THESE DIFFERENT -- PSYCHIATRIC. FACILITIES ARE HOSPITALS ARE -- WHATEVER SEEMS LIKE A FAIR QUESTION. JUST JUST ON THE LIABILITY YOU THINK THAT THEY THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED IT REMAINS THE SAME. FOR THE PARAMEDICS. YOU DON'T THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY HELPS I MEAN THERE'S A MINUTE SO WERE TAKEN AND HEALTH COMMITTEE THAT HELPS THE BILL BUT AGAIN. YOU KNOW IF I COULD JUST FOCUS AND DISSECT ONE BILL ON AND NARAL ISSUE IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR ME MY OB WILL BE. BUT HE'S BUT I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE OVER ARCHING POLICY AND YOU KNOW WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THESE HEARINGS TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW. A NO RESPECTFULLY MANAGER SO I HAVE TO THEN LOOK AT THE BROADER POLICY IN FOR US IT DOESN'T ADD UP. I'D MANAGER ITEM FAULT THE WITNESSES AT ALL I'M JUST YEAH RIGHT I UNDERSTAND AND I HEAR I HEAR WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT I DON'T KNOW WHY WE GOT IT WE GOT IT WELL WE GOT A FOR THE LIABILITY I UNDERSTAND CLEARLY THAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIND. AGAIN THAT SWEET SPOT SOMEWHERE THERE -- HAVE BUT THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE AT THIS SORT OF THING CROUCHING ON THE THE KIND OF CARE THAT IS PROVIDED BY BY OUR OUTSTANDING NURSES AS WELL. ANY OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD -- ONE WE'RE CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT NEW MEXICO -- WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND INTO ONE OF THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT A SEAT I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVES -- THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S STATE FEDERATION LABOR HAVE WELL ABLE QUALIFIED EXPERIENCED NURSES -- AND TOOK IN TERMS OF THAT BODY -- THAT THEY CAN SUE SOMEONE TO BE PART OF THIS PARTICULAR -- ONBOARD AND SO -- WE BELIEVE AGAIN THAT THIS IS RIGHT -- TO MAKING SURE THAT -- ONE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVING MENTAL ILLNESSES -- DON'T HAVE TO SET UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS HOURS AND AT A TIME WHEN THEY CAN GO TO A SPECIALIZED FACILITY TO GET THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY NEED AND THE SAME FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTOXICATED. OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS -- NOT SITTING IN EMERGENCY ROLE FOR TIME FOR HOURS AT A TIME THEREFORE THE EMERGENCY ROOM SHOULD BE DOES SHE KEEP WITH THE CONTINUITY OF EMERGENCIES EMERGENCIES OF OUR LOVE WAS GOING. WHO'S HAVING HEART ATTACKS STROKES GUNSHOT ACCIDENTS THOSE ARE THE EMERGENCY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THIS WILL FREE UP THAT STAFF TO THE I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I VOTE. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE WORK IN THIS BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL BASICALLY ON THE SAME TEAM HERE ON THIS. WITH THE SAME GOAL -- THERE IS A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER SIXTY A. B.

AGAIN I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE TWO MINUTES TO WITNESSES ON EACH SIDE AND WE'VE GOT TO KEEP TO THAT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF THIS CALENDAR. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M YOU'VE SEEN THIS BILL BEFORE. LAST YEAR IT WAS PASSED IN UNFORTUNATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT AB -- FIFTY ONE WOULD END THE USE OF THAT. FORCED. ARBITRATION -- AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT OUR LEGISLATURE'S PASSED IN THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY GET SEXUAL HARASSMENT PAY INEQUITY DISCRIMINATION WAGE THEFT AND OTHER AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS. BUT THESE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CAN'T BE ENFORCING COURT OR BY STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER HAS FORCED THEIR WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS IN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR JOBS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THAT ARE SIGNED NOW WOULD BE IN PLACE IT JUST COULDN'T BE A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT -- BOTH SIDES UP OBVIOUSLY COULD COULD VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT --WITHOUT ALL THAT MY WITNESSES SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH AND YOU DON'T TO USE THE FULL TWO MINUTES BUT I WILL BE CUTTING YOU OFF AT THAT POINT SO. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ONE SPONSORS OF THE BILL WHEN I THINK THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS ADD THIS BILL IN BEING SUCH A GREAT ADVOCATE -- IN TERMS OF FORCE ARBITRATION ITS IMPACT ON WORKERS -- AS SHE SAID AB FIFTY ONE ASSEMBLY ENSURES THAT WORKERS ARE REQUIRED TO SIGN FORCE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR CLAIMS SUCH AS HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION PAY EQUITY WASTE EFFORT DELEGATION. OTHER WORK WORKER PROTECTION LAWS WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS ARE USING FORCE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS CLEAR THE SKYROCKETED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE IT ONLY COVERED ABOUT 16% OF WORKERS BUT AS OF TODAY. WE KNOW THAT FORCE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS REQUIRE FOR OVER 60% OF CALIFORNIA WORKPLACES AS INCREDIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICULARLY COMPARED TO HELP YOU REQUIRED BACK IN -- TWENTY TWELVE WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWED THAT FORCE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INFORM THIS -- FAVORABLE FOR WORKERS WE KNOW THAT WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BRING CLAIMS AND FORCED ARBITRATION WE KNOW THAT THE WORTH A FEW WORKERS WHO DO ARE LESS LIKELY TO WIN. AND IF YOU WORKERS WHO BRING A CLAIM AND TO WIN WITH SUBSTANTIALLY LESS IN DAMAGES THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T QUIRK -- BUT THE AT THE ANALYSIS DID A GREAT JOB OF LOOKING AT IN EXPLAINING HOW THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT FROM HAS ITERATIONS OF THE BILL AND HOW -- THE CASES THAT RELIED ON BY SOME OF THE OPPONENTS ARE AND NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS NEARLY TAYLOR VERSION OF THE BILL WE THINK THAT THE THAT WE KNOW THE STATE'S CAN DO. VERY LITTLE IN TERMS OF FORCE ARBITRATION OF WAY FEDERAL PREEMPTION BUT WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS NARROWLY CRAFTED NARROWLY TAILORED TO AVOID THAT FEDERAL PREEMPTION MY IT DOES NOT -- IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT FORCED ARBITRATION IT AS I AM VALITY ANY SUCH AGREEMENT IN FACT THIS BILL LOOKS SAID EMPLOYER BEHAVIOR BEFORE THE AGREEMENT IS EVERYTHING SIGN -- SO FOR THESE REASONS OF WE RESPECTFULLY ASK REVIVAL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACKIE STERN AND ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTY ONE THE REMARKABLE RISE OF FORCE ARBITRATION THE WORKPLACE IS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE SUPREME COURT RULINGS THAT HAVE ALLOWED BUSINESSES TO EXPAND ITS USE. INFORMATION ABOUT FOUR TO RETREAT IN A SCARCE HOWEVER BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OF OUR PUBLIC COURT SYSTEM. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA STARTED REQUIRING ARBITRATION FIRMS WITH CLIENTS IN THE STATE TO PUBLISH LIMITED DATA ABOUT THEIR CASES. AN ANALYSIS OF THE LARGEST FIRM IN THE U. S. HANDLING ABOUT 50% OF ALL EMPLOYMENT CASES SHOWED. THAT ABOUT EIGHT WITH EIGHT THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND NINE COMPLAINTS WERE BROUGHT BY WORKERS IN A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. THE ARBITATORS AWARDED MONETARY DAMAGES TO WORKERS AND ONLY ONE POINT 8% OF THOSE CASES WITH ALMOST 70% BEING SETTLED THROUGH UNSPECIFIED MEANS. THIS IS THE REAL RESULT OF FORCED ARBITRATION. AND THIS IS THE VERY LITTLE DATA THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THE BIGGER RESULT IS REALLY CLAIM SUPPRESSION BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF THESE CASES WILL NEVER MOVE FORWARD. AND SIMPLY GO AWAY. AB FIFTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE A CHOICE BEFORE WAVING THE RIGHTS IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU PLEASE STEP FORWARD TO THE MIKE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION ONLY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAP I WITH THE TEAMSTERS IN SAG AFTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES I'M SORRY CHALLENGES WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE SEE THE CHAMBER. THERE SHE IS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER PEREIRA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB FIFTY ONE OUR PRIMARY CONCERN AN ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS BILL IS PRINTED -- WHEN I TESTIFIED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK I WAS PRETTY CONFIDENT AND NOW I'M EVEN MORE CONFIDENT GIVEN THE FACT THAT -- NEW YORK ACTUALLY PASSED A LAW LAST YEAR THAT SAID AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT YOU CANNOT HAVE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT -- REQUIRED ARBITRATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES AND JUST LAST WEEK THE UNITED STATES -- SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF NEW YORK CAME DOWN AND SAID THAT IS PRE EMPTED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT YOU CANNOT PUT A SPECIAL LIMITATION ON THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT AB FIFTY ONE DOES SIMILAR TO THAT. LAW THAT WAS PASSED BY NEW YORK IN SIMILAR TO AB THIRTY EIGHTY LAST YEAR WHICH GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED AND SAID THIS PLAINLY VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW. IT PLACES A SPECIAL RESTRICTION ON THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF OTHER EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS THAT ARE SIGNED AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT YOUR SALARY YOUR BENEFITS -- EGGS AT LEAVE OF ABSENCE IS. HOW YOU'RE GOING DIED TO BE TERMINATED AND THOSE CAN ALL BE MADE AS A CONDITION OF A CONTRACT OR A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT BUT THIS BILL SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE ARBITRATION CLAUSES AS A CONDITION OF A CONTRACT? TO IT DOES PUT A SPECIAL LIMITATION ON THE FORMATION OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IS THE ISSUE THAT JUSTICE KAGAN CAME DOWN AND SAID IN THE CONDUCT NURSING CASE THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH NOT JUST ONCE A CONTRACT IS FORMED ON ITS -- ENFORCEMENT OF IT BUT HOW A CONTRACT FOR A PATRICIAN IS FORMED AND YOU CANNOT PUT SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS ON IT -- SO WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL BE PRINTED IF IT IS CHALLENGED IN COURT AND IS PRE EMPTED I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL BENEFITS EMPLOYEES IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T BENEFIT EMPLOYERS AS IT'S GOING TO CREATE. UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARDS THE ENFORCEMENT OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND WILL LEAD TO MORE LITIGATION COSTS I'M IN ONE ISSUE THAT I DID WANT TO ADDRESS AS IT WAS REYES LATIN LAST COMMITTEE HEARING. IS WELL WHAT DO EMPLOYERS HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FOLLOW THE LAN AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION -- I CAN UTILIZE THE DYNAMICS DECISION AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF EMPLOYERS WHO FALL THE LAW WE'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OFFICE TOLD THEM TO DO WITH RESPECT. TO CLASSIFYING INDIVIDUALS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THE BRELO DECISION A SUPREME COURT DECISION COMES DOWN THE NEXT DAY IT CHANGES EVERYTHING AND THEY'RE HELL RETROACTIVELY LIABLE FOR FOUR YEARS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED AND IT'S NOT JUST AS EASY THANK YOU SO MUCH TIME WITH A LOT THE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE HIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. ARBITRATION IS -- JUST LEGAL FAIR EFFICIENT MEANS OF RESOLVING DISPUTES -- IT IS NOT THE SAME AS BRINGING A LAWSUIT BUT THE PARTIES INVOLVED GET TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM NEVER THE LESS THERE THAN PAT IN FACT BEEN EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT SHOW AND EMPLOYMENT CASES PLAINTIFFS RECEIVE ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT AN ARBITRATION THAT THEY WOULD IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT BUT IN. FACT FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOTTEN TO LIKE HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T ACTUALLY COURT -- THAT CHAMBER ARTICULATED THAT VERY VALID CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BEING -- IN -- PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW BUT WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT ARBITRATION IS LESSER OR UNFAIR JUST AS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WOULD STEP FOR WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION ONLY PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIA SPERBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS NICKEL. A LONG DAY FOR ALL OF US NICOLE RISE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES A TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ALSO ARE POSE FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPOSED RIGHT COURSE IN RESPONSE TO THAT LAST ARGUMENT IF IF THIS IS SUCH A GREAT SYSTEM THAT EMPLOYEES WOULD OPT INTO IT. SO -- I SORT OF THINK RETHINK THAT -- ONE I'M NOT SURE IF IT MAKES YOU A POINT BUT BUT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THE COURT CASE DID COME DOWN IT DID IT DID. IDENTIFY THAT -- THESE -- WERE NULL AND VOID THE THE THE POSITION AGAIN SORRY I WONDER IF YOU COULD. COMMENT ON THAT AND AS FAR AS DYNAMIX GOES I DON'T THINK THIS IS A DYNAMIC SITUATION AT ALL BUT IF YOU WOULD. TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM ABOUT PREEMPTION -- THIS THIS LAW WAS SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN IN ORDER TO AVOID PREEMPTION THE ONLY -- CONDITION WERE SETTING IS THAT IT'S VOLUNTARY AND LAST I CHECKED AND LAW SCHOOL A CONTRACT SHOULD BE ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY -- IT DOES NOT SAY THAT A WORKER CANNOT SIGN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IT DOES NOT SAY WHAT HAS TO BE OR CANNOT BE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT UNLIKE THE NEW YORK LAW WHICH SPECIFICALLY SAID IT COULDN'T COVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE KEPT OUR IS VERY BROAD IT JUST SAYS THAT IT HAS TO IT CANNOT BE I'M FORCED UPON A WORKERS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT -- WE THINK THAT'S NARROWLY TAILORED WE PASSED A LOT OF BILLS IN THIS -- IN THIS HOUSE TO TAKE ON AT MISGUIDED FEDERAL AT LEAST AND SO AM I OF COURSE THIS WILL BE LITIGATED THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK WE WILL PREVAIL AND I THINK I WORKERS WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE OF IT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO THROW IN I THINK I IT HAD ASKED FOR THIS ONCE BEFORE IF THERE ARE AMENDMENTS I WOULD LIE TO JOIN IN I THINK THAT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. SHOULD ALLOW CHOICE -- ARBITRATIONS ARE -- BASICALLY. A SET FORTH WHERE ONE DOESN'T GET TO EXERCISE WHAT I THINK IS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO GO TO COURT -- AND SO I AM INHERENTLY OPPOSED TO THEM I KNOW THAT -- AS I MENTIONED AT THE LAST HEARING BY BEEN OVERRULED BY THE SUPREME COURT WHOEVER THOSE FOLKS ARE. AND BUT I THINK THAT -- OF AS WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE MORE CAREFULLY THE REALLY PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT WHETHER OR NOT. TO TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION TO AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS -- TO REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES IN A COURT OF LAW -- AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE THE BALANCING YOU'RE TRYING TO GET IT MAY BE IT MAY BE BY THIS COURT THAT'S BEEN SO LOADED WITH ANTI. YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE. GEN JUSTICES THAT UP. MAYBE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTED ALTHOUGH I IT'S MY HOPE THAT IF WE KEEP ON PUSHING WILL ACTUALLY GET BACK OUR RIGHTS. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO LITIGATE OR ARBITRATE THAT SHOULD BE THE CHOICE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS HIM PERHAPS. IF THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM IS THAT GREAT THE IT WILL GET MORE BUSINESS THAN THE LEGAL SYSTEM BUT RIGHT NOW -- TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO ARBITRATION LIKE I JUST. I DON'T SEE IT I I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD EVER BE CONSIDERED CONSTITUTIONAL BUT APPARENTLY IT HAS MAYBE HAVE TO GO BACK AND READ ALL THE CASES BUT NOT FOR WHAT WE GET PAID ON THIS JOB SO. AND ALSO JUST IN ALONG WITH LITIGATOR ARBITRATE WE ALSO WANT THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER -- AND AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF WORKERS AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS AVOIDED ARCHITECT TAKEN AWAY FROM WORKERS AND OBVIOUSLY WE BELIEVE IN LABOR COMMISSIONER -- SIR WHITE HOUSE KEY FOR BY SENATOR RAZA PERHAPS I MISS READ THE HAD THE BILL BUT YOU'RE ALLOWING FOR YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING -- EMPLOYERS TO FORCE EMPLOYEES TO WAIVE THEIR THE RIGHTS FOR FUTURE DISPUTES REGARDING HARASSMENT THERE'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AL FUTURE DISPUTES IS HARASSMENT. DISCRIMINATION CIVIL RIGHTS RETALIATION AND LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS THIS IS JUST THE I MEAN THERE COULD BE OTHER DISPUTES IS I GUESS IS MY QUESTION THAT. COULD BE YOU COULD. ARGUABLY FOR SOME PARTY TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS IF IT WAS IN. THAT POCKET. YEAH. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING RIGHT NOW WE ARE WE LIVE. THERE THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TENSION ONLY LAST YEAR IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THE CHAMBER THIS YEAR BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET US JUST TO DO IT ON HARASSMENT ISSUES LAST YEAR WHEN THEY CARED MORE ABOUT THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. AND DIDN'T ONE LOOK LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET SEXUAL HARASSERS -- TO BE ABLE TO BE. HIDDEN THEN THAT'S WHAT ARBITRATION DOES -- BUT IN AND SO WE WERE VERY CEAR THAT IT'S NOT JUST TRANSMITS DISCRIMINATION IT'S WAGE THEFT IT'S ALL THE ISSUES THAT A WORKER MAY FACE AND IN NEED RE AB TO REDRESS EITHER. THROUGH LITIGATION OR LABOR COMMISSIONER AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE LIST IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN CLOSE ABOUT. AND IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING. SO SENATOR SO I HAVE TO EXCUSE MYSELF MY APOLOGIES BECAUSE THEY'RE LIFTING THE CALLS IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND I WILL BE BACK YEAH. MEMBERS OF THE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS SENATE ROTH I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT AND I'M REALLY GLAD THAT. IS SIMPLY MEMBERS IS BEING IN THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT ARBITRATION IS THE WAY. TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WHEN THERE'S A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SO THERE IS. GREAT VALUE IN GOING TO ARBITRATION PRISON WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING. AND THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE TOTALLY ON A ON EQUAL FOOTING. IS WHEN BEING FORCED TO USE THE ON THE PEOPLE. OPTION IS WORDS RON AND WORKING PEOPLE KNOW WHEN IT'S EQUAL AND WHEN IT'S ON THE COOL SO I I I DON'T WANT THIS TO GET. CONFUSED AS FAR AS THE VALUE OF ARBITRATION IS BOTH THE MEANT. TO NOT TO USE UP -- YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS AND FORMAL COURT PROCEEDINGS IF YOU CAN RESOLVE SOMETHING SO. YOU KNOW -- THE PROBLEM IT IS NOW AS OF YOU KNOW YOUR COERCED INTO AGREEING TO IT AND THEN THERE FOR YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. OF FAIR SYSTEM SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THEM SOME WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SB I'VE AT THIRD. WE WOULD LEAVE NEED A MOTION. SMOOVE BY CENTER GONZALEZ. ASSISTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SECOND ANY PERSON PURCHASING A HORSE AT A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OR PRIVATE AUCTION MUST SIGN A STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY A KNOWLEDGE IN THE GREEN TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA EXISTING MAN.

FOLLOWING THE INITIAL POST WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT CASES AND WHY WITH THE AMERICAN WILD HORSE CAMPAIGN AND MAKING GAINS IN THE AUCTION COURSES RESCUE. HI SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SUZANNE ROY WITH THE AMERICAN WILD HORSE CAMPAIGN. AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GLORIA FOR AUTHORING THE BILL AND ARE CO AUTHORS. ASSEMBLYMAN WELL MEMBERS WALDRON BLOOM BURNER **** BATH CERVANTES CHOI CALL AROUND LEVINE. AND SENATORS CHIANG PORTANTINO AN HERTZBERG -- AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT SEEKS TO BETTER PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WILD AND DOMESTIC FORCES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA HAS AMENDED AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT SEVERAL TIMES TO TAKE INTO CONSIDER. CONSIDERATION ISSUES RAISED BY A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS WE BELIEVE AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT AS AMENDED STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE OF MAKING SOME MODEST PROGRESS. TOWARD MORE MEANINGFUL PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S HORSES WELL NOT UNDULY BURDENING HORSE RELATED ENTITIES OR JEOPARDIZING ANY EXISTING PROTECTIONS. THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION ARE BOTH NEUTRAL ON THE BILL -- THE THE LAST PROVISION THAT MR GLORIA MENTIONED IS SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION THAT WAS SIGNED. IN MAY IN NEW JERSEY WITH THE INTENT OF FACILITATING IDENTIFICATION A RESCUE OF FORCES AT AUCTION AND EFFORTS TO REUNITE -- HORSES LOST IN MISSING MORSE'S WITH THEIR OWNERS. A MICROCHIP SCANNING IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING THE PRIMARY MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION FOR HORSES WITHIN THE HORSE INDUSTRY PLEASE NOTE THAT AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT DOES NOT REQUIRE. WALL OWNERS TO MICROCHIP THEIR HORSES IT MERELY REQUIRES ANY EXISTING MICROCHIP TIP INFORMATION TO BE POSTED. ON OUR EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA LAW ARE COMBINED WITH ADVOCACY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE FROM SELLING WILD HORSES WITHOUT LIMITATION ON SLAUGHTER. AND TO PROHIBIT THE EXPORT OF HORSES FROM THE U. S. FOR SLAUGHTER SO WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE EARLY THIS MORNING. AND OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR TIME WE SENT THEM HOME AND SAID WE WOULD REPRESENT MUCH APPRECIATE. SO MUCH THAT SCORES YOU LOTS OF BROWNIE POINTS NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON I'D SURE JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE TWENTY EIGHT MY NAME IS MEGAN GAINES AND I RUN AUCTION HORSES RESCUE A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT BASED IN LOS ANGELES. I'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES RESCUING IN NETWORKING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED HORSES FROM CALIFORNIA AUCTION SINCE. TWENTY ELEVEN MY RESCUE WORK IS TAKING ME TO SEVEN AUCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. DESPITE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIX IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE PURCHASE OF HORSES FOR SLAUGHTER CONTINUES TO BE BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR LOW AND HOARSE TRADERS. MANY FINAL HORSES TO KILL BUYERS WHO SELL THEM TO A THIRD PARTY OUT OF STATE. THE THIRD PARTY THAN SHIPS THE HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN MEXICO OR CANADA. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR WORSE IS THAT THESE AUCTIONS IS HEARTBREAKING ONCE LOVED AND DOTED ON HORSES ARE DONE WHEN THEY BECOME TO OLDER SORE. SENT TO AUCTION BETRAYED BY THE VERY PEOPLE THEY'VE TIRELESSLY WORKED. FOR INSTEAD OF A SAFE RETIREMENT OR AT THE VERY LEAST HUMANE EUTHANASIA THESE POOR HORSES ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES OF THE AUCTION. THEIR HORSES PAST THEIR PRIME WITH VARYING ISSUES AND THEY'RE HEARTLESS LEASE SO HEARTLESS WE SOLD WITHOUT HESITATION. MOST WIND UP ON THE SLAUGHTER TRUCK IN THESE HORSES DESERVE SO MUCH MORE. I AM PARTICULARLY THANKFUL FOR THE ID REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL. MANY CALIFORNIA HORSES SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS IN OUR SOLE TO SLAUGHTER YOU WITH AFTER VIOLATION OF LOCAL RACE TRACKS IN THE SLAUGHTER AUCTION POLICIES. OVER IS IDENTIFIED THE ATTACK TO BRANDER MICROCHIP HAS A FAR HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING RESCUED. HOWEVER MANY OPTIONS GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO RESTRICT THE RESCUERS ACCESS TO THIS OFTEN LIFESAVING INFORMATION. AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT'S IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WILL GIVE RESCUERS A CHANCE TO IDENTIFY HORSES AND HOPEFULLY GET THEM TO SAFETY. THIS BILL IS A MODEST APPROACH TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF COURSE IS GOING TO SLAUGHTER AND I BELIEVE IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE I SINCERELY URGE YOU TO PASS AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G UNDER.&lt;/c&gt; THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE SUFFICIENT SUPPORT THANK YOU.

I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS BILL -- THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS BROUGHT TO MY OFFICE HAVE BENEFITTED THIS BILL IMMENSELY AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL CHOIR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO RETAIN PUBLIC RECORDS THAT ARE TRANSMITTED BY EMAIL. FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS THIS WILL CLARIFY EXISTING PUBLIC WRITTEN RECORD RETENTION LAW AND BRING IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. MAY OF NINETEEN YEARS INTO IT -- I WANT TO PUT A AND I WOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY EMAILS IN MY BILL IS INTERESTED IN OUR THOSE CONTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS. PREPARED OWNED USED OR RETAINED BY ANY PUBLIC AGENCY. EMAILS ARE CRITICAL TO CONDUCTING THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS AND TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS REPUBLIC RECORDS NEED TO BE PROPERLY APPLIED TO THEM. CURRENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND AGENCIES HAVE RADICALLY DIFFERENT BUT BUT EMAIL RETENTION POLICIES IN MY HOME COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO SOME CITIES KEEP THEIR EMAILS FOR AS LITTLE AS THIRTY DAYS WHILE OTHERS KEEP THEIR EMAILS INDEFINITELY. THE NEW UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RIGHT RECENTLY SETTLE LAWSUIT AFTER THEY APPROVED A POLICY THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THOUSANDS OF EMAILS PRIOR TO THE TWO YEAR REQUIREMENT. THIS IS A MEDICATION WAS EXTREMELY COSTLY SOME OF THOSE EMAILS ARE LIKELY SUBJECT DEPENDING PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. AND LIKELY THEY WILL NOT ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE POLICY BUT SHOWS WHY THERE'S A REAL NEED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION IF NOTHING ELSE TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW. IN TWENTY NINETEEN EMAILS ARE EQUAL RELEVANCE TO PAPER RECORDS IS INSANE TO ME THAT I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN PUBLIC BUT IT IS TRUE AND YOU ALL KNOW IT. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR INSURERS THAT ARE PUBLIC RECORD RETENTION REQUIREMENTS ARE PROPERLY APPLIED TO EMAILS GIVEN THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE IN HOW PUBLIC AGENCIES CONDUCT THEIR WORK.

TO THAT INFORMATION SO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW POLICY IS BEING DEVELOPED AND ALSO IT -- IS A GOOD INDICATION IF THERE ARE NEFARIOUS THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON A PREVENT CORRUPTION. AND OTHER TYPES OF BAD BEHAVIOR FROM HAPPENING BOB IT'S A CLEAR BILL AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN SAID IT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE EMAILS THAT ARE USED IN THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS AND NOTHING ELSE.

ATTACHED YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE P. ARE ABLE -- TO TWENTY RECIPIENTS AND RATHER THAN KEEPING JUST THE EMAIL THAT WAS SENT -- WHICH HAS THE RECORD -- THE AGENCY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO STORE ALL TWENTY ONE EMAILS OF THAT DOCUMENT ATTACHING IF SOMEONE WERE TO APPLY YOU KNOW WITH A SIMPLE THANK YOU. TO APPLY ALL THAT'S ANOTHER TWENTY ONE EMAILS THAT WOULD HAVE TO RETAIN AGAIN -- IT'S IT SOUNDS REALLY PRETTY INNOCUOUS BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT -- THE COST OF ON PREMISES STORAGE -- THE AMOUNT -- THAT LOCAL AGENCY SAID PAPER CLOUD STORAGE IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT WORK AT THAT WERE AYE I'M CONCERNED WITH.

GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO REMIND THE WITNESSES WE ARE HOLDING YOU TO NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES EACH AND I WILL CUT YOU OFF MY APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MANAGER. WE ALL SEE EVIDENCE OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY. WEATHER WAS THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO WHICH CALLED TWENTY PEOPLE AND INJURED. SIX HUNDRED THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PASSING A MOTION AUTHORED BY SUPERVISOR SHEILA KEWL EARLIER THIS YEAR TO EXPAND SAFE PARKING IN THE COUNTY. THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WE INTERACT WITH JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL IN SACRAMENTO OR IN MY DISTRICT THE ROW OF OUR VIS DEADLINE EL CAMINO RIEL. ON THE BORDER STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT IS IMPACTING OUR WORKING POOR OR RETIREES. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY WE DIDN'T REALIZE TO WHAT EXTENT HOMELESSNESS WAS IMPACTING A VERY DIFFERENT GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COLLEGE STUDENTS. A RECENT REPORT RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE HOPE CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE WHICH SURVEYED NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT FIFTY SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOUND THAT 19% OF RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THAT'S ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE. THIS NUMBER IS SHOCKING ALARMING AND TRAGIC AND IT MUST BE A CALL TO ACTION. AB THREE OH TWO WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE A SAFE PARKING LOT ON CAMPUS FOR THE HOMELESS STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES. THE IDEA OF PROVIDING SAFE OVERNIGHT PARKING IS NOT NEW. IN FACT NEW BEGINNINGS SANTA BARBARA BASED SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IS THE ORIGINAL SAFE PARKING PROGRAM THAT IS OPERATED SUCCESSFULLY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT. WHEN I WAS ON THE CALL TO CITY COUNCIL? THOSE WHO OPERATE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM SUCH AS NEW BEGINNINGS SAFE PARKING LA. DREAMS FOR CHANGE IN SAN DIEGO AND LIFE MOVES IN SAN JOSE ALL SUPPORT A. B. THREE OH TWO AND RECOGNIZE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THIS BILL WOULD HAVE FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS. UNDER AB THREE OR TWO EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL BE PROVIDED BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT MEETS THE LOCAL NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AB THREE OH TWO ALSO IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIES THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HOMELESS STUDENTS WHO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING FACILITIES. BE CONNECTED TO AVAILABLE STATE COUNTY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING FOOD AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES. WHEN THE BILL WAS HEARD AND SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE I ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS WHICH? ADDED A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS THAT A SUDENT MUST BE ENROLLED IN TO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING FACILITIES ADDED A SUNSET DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WITH REPORTING. AND ADDED AN OPT OUT FROM THE BILL'S PROVISIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT SPECIFIED HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT CHAIR IN HER COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK AND THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS PROVIDED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING KEY COMPONENTS. ADDRESSING LIABILITY BY GRANTING THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF IMMUNITY IN STATUTE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN LIEU OF A LIABILITY WAIVER. THIS IMMUNITY DOES NOT APPLY TO GROSS NEGLIGENCE INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATIONS OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW. INCLUDING SOME MINIMAL SAFEGUARDS AND ASSURANCES THAT STUDENTS FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RULES ADOPTED BY THE DISTRICT. AS IN ALICE'S POINTS OUT THESE AMENDMENTS WILL GIVE DISTRICTS GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY. PROVIDE MORE CLARITY TO THE PUBLIC IN AFFECTED STUDENTS THAT PREVENT UNNECESSARY COSTLY LITIGATION. I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS ASKING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO BE MORE THAN THEY EVER HAVE ADD TO IN THE PAST. BUT WE ARE AT A SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALL HAVE TO DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER DONE BEFORE. LET ME BE CLEAR. AB THREE OR TWO IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE. IT'S SAD. THE FACT THAT WE'RE EVEN DISCUSSING THIS IS A REFLECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S FAILURE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD THE HOUSING NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF OUR GROWING POPULATION. BUT WE CAN'T LOOK AWAY OR V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> THIS ISSUE JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES US FEEL AWKWARD. THE REALITY IS THAT STUDENTS ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR VEHICLES OR EVEN OUT ON THE STREET. TONIGHT. AND WHEN WE DON'T TO PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP. OR WE OPPOSE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION LIKE A. B. THREE OR TWO BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE ENTIRE HOUSING CRISIS. WE FORCE THE STUDENTS TO STAY IN THE SHADOWS AND DARK ALLEYS AND INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHERE THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE. AB THREE OR TWO IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS. BUT THAT WILL TAKE YEARS THEN IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW. TONIGHT. AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THEIR SITUATION A LITTLE BETTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'M HONORED TO BE JOINED BY TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO KNOW ONLY TOO WELL WHAT ARE HOMELESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FACING. A SICKLY A CARTER A RECENT STUDENT PORTAL COLLEGE IN Y DISTRICT WHO IS HERE TODAY TO SHARE HER STORY AND EXPERIENCE. AND THE ISSUE HERE A HYATT DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO START BY SAYING HOW HONORED I AM TO BE HERE TODAY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND A COMMNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO FACED HOMELESSNESS LAST YEAR. MY NAME IS ALI A CARTER I RECENTLY ENLISTED IN THE ARMY NATIONAL GUARD AND JOIN THE LECTURE SHINS UNION. I'LL BE ENTERING AN APPRENTICESHIP AFTER BOOT CAMP. I WAS A STUDENT AT FOOTHILL COLLEGE IN JUST COMPLETED MY LAST CLASS JUNE TWENTY SIX WHILE I WAS A STUDENT I WAS ALSO HOMELESS. A FEW YEARS BACK I DECIDED TO FINISH MY EDUCATION IN ORDER FOR ME TO DO SO I HAD TO SACRIFICE HOUSING SO I COULD FOCUS ON ACCOMPLISHING MY GOALS. MY HOMELESS JOURNEY BEGAN IN EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN I WAS FORCED TO LIVE OUT OF MY CAR WHERE I FELT VERY UNSAFE. I PARK MY CAR IN A JUNK YARD AND GILROY SOMETIMES I SLEPT IN WALMART PARKING LOT OR IN FRONT OF AN I HOP. BUT OFTEN WILL BE TOLD I HAD TO LEAVE. I COULD NOT LIVE AT HOME WITH MY FAMILY BECAUSE THEY SUFFER FROM SEVERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES THEREFORE MY CAR WAS MY ONLY OPTION. A TYPICAL DAY BEGAN WITH THE SHOWER CAMPUS ONE CHECK. YES AGENCY CLASSES THAT AFTERNOON SPEND AT THE LIBRARY SO I COULD USE WIFI FOR COURSEWORK. COMING EVENING I HAD TO FIND A PLACE TO PARK AND SLEEP FOR THE NIGHT. HOMELESSNESS HOMELESSNESS PRESENTS AN OBSTACLE WHILE PURSUING EDUCATION THIS OBSTACLE BECOMES EVEN MORE FORMIDABLE WHILE PURSUING OTHER GOALS WHICH IN MY CASE. WERE MILITARY ENLISTMENT AND OCCASIONAL TRAINING. WELL I HAVE OVERCOME THE CIRCUMSTANCES SELDOM MY STORIES NOT UNIQUE. THERE ARE MANY MORE STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW. AB THREE A TWO WOULD HELP ME IMMENSELY SAFETY SECURITY AND ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND RESOURCES OFTEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED SUCH AS RESTAURANTS AND FACILITIES FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BENEFITS. AB TWO WOULD HAVE A LOT AB THREE OH TWO WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ME TO PURSUE MY EDUCATION WITHOUT AND DURING DE HUMANIZING EXPERIENCES AND VIOLENCE IN A LOT ME TO BETTER MAINTAIN. THE DIGNITY THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR EXISTENCE AS HUMAN BEINGS. AB THREE OH TWO IS INVALUABLE FOR HOMELESS COLLEGE STUDENTS I AM HONORED TO HELP BRING AWARENESS AND HOPE YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY STORY. THANK YOU I'M REMINDED. ONE SOME OF US OLDER FOLKS WERE IN COLLEGE THE PEOPLE LIVE. IN THEIR VW BUSES FOR TIE DYE SHIRTS AND PROBABLY SMOKED WAY TOO MUCH GANJA. AND BUT THEY WERE HOMELESS CASSETTES THAT'S WHERE THEY WANTED TO BE AND NOW WE FIND SO MANY STUDENTS. WHO ARE HOMELESS WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AND I THINK THAT'S THE PRE SHAKE YOUR STORY? SO A NEXT WITNESS PLEASE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME MISSION HER HEIGHT AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HOMELESS YOUTH PROJECT. AND OUR GOAL IS TO TREAT POLICYMAKERS ON THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS I'M HERE TO SPEAK SORT OF AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON THIS. ISSUE OVERNIGHT PARKING ACCESS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO WE KNOW NEARLY ONE IN FIVE COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE ALMOST AS IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PAST YEAR. AND RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THE STUDENTS ARE WORKING. THEY JUST ARE MAKING A LIVING WAGE. IN ADDITION TO COMMUNITIES A SUMMER BERMAN MENTIONED LGBT STUDENTS STUDENTS TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY LIKE CELIA -- AND THOSE WHO ARE PREGNANT PARENTING ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY HOMELESSNESS. WHEN WE SURVEYED COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOMELESS LIAISONS LAST THE GREATEST NEED OF THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE? AND THE HARDEST NEED FOR THEM TO MEET. WHEN WE FAIL TO PROVIDE FOR STUDENTS THEY ARE FORCED TO DECIDE BETWEEN FOOD AND BOOKS OR HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION? AND WE TALK WITH STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THEY OFTEN BEMOANED THE LACK OF SAFE SPACES TO EXIST. THIS BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THEM ALREADY ARE. IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A SAFER SPACE TO SLEEP WHILE CONNECTING TO THEIR INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT POINT TIME COUNT NUMBERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE NOT ON THE CUSP OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS. WHAT WE FOCUS ON LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY BE EMPLOYING HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES TO MATERIALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE AND IN THEIR CARS? IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE INTERIM STEPS TO REDUCE THE HARM CREATED BY OUR LACK OF HOUSING STOCK NOW. WELL IT'S NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO END HOMELESSNESS IT'S EVERYONE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND TO RESIST CONTINUED IN ACTION. I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR IS BIASED TOWARD ACTION IN ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF COLLEGE HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE WELL UNDERSTANDING AT THE FIRST STEP TOWARD CONNECTING THESE STUDENTS TO HOUSING IN SUPPORT OF SERVICES THANK YOU SO MUCH.

YOU YOU'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIT HERE FOR THE FIRST TWO WITNESSES -- FEEL FREE. TO WE CHECKED TWO MINUTES OR LESS. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT AFTERNOON WAS AT EFFORT ON BEHALF ME COLLEGE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO RESPECTFULLY PROVIDER CONCERNS IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE PARTNERED WITH THE SYSTEM OFFICE RELEASED THE HOPE LAB SURVEY. REFERENCE BY MISTER BERMAN AND MENTIONED IN THIS ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUR GOAL WAS TO GALVANIZE STATE LEADERS TO ADDRESS. ENTRENCHED EQUITY RESOURCE ISSUES REFORM CAL GRANTS. TO COVER LIVING EXPENSES AND CALL ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO FIND MORE APPRENTICESHIPS EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORT SERVICES. LIKE THOSE THAT HELP STUDENTS LIKE CELIA. FOR THE PATH OF STABLE HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE BEEN DISHEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT-ALL THIS SOBERING DATA HAS DONE. IS LEAD TO THE RECLUSION OF ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS TO PARKING LOTS. MANY STUDENTS ALSO SHARE THIS PERSPECTIVE. AS KELLI THE STATE WIDE SOON TRUSTEE AND MEMBER OF THE STUDENT SENATE PUT IT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT CLASS WARFARE. THE STATE HAS DECIDED WHOSE NEEDS BILL ADDRESS AND IT'S NOT THOSE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. BEYOND EQUITY ISSUES WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL'S RELIANCE ON THE BROKEN UNFUNDED STATE MANDATE SYSTEM. AS A RESOURCE TO IMPLEMENT. IMPLEMENT THE BILL'S PROVISIONS. WHILE OTHER COLLEGES RECOGNIZE COMMITTEES LOOKING AT LIABILITY. GIVEN SCARCE RESOURCES IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO MAKE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS. FROM CRIME THEFT ROBBERY OR RAPE. UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS. IN TURN THIS BILL WILL EXPOSE COLLEGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO LIABILITY IN LAWSUITS. THE BILL CREATES NEW SECURITY AND SAFETY CHALLENGES SUCH AS THE NEED FOR TWENTY FOUR HOUR. MONITORING [inaudible] EIGHTY A RESTROOMS -- IN PARKING LOTS. TRIGGERING OF HOUSING LAWS. AND QUESTIONS ABOUT MANDATED REPORTERS. CURRENT OPT OUT PROVISIONS ALSO CANNOT BE MET BY OVER 90% OF COLLEGES. WITHOUT A THOUGHTFUL PLAN TO READ TO BUILD HOUSING PARTNERSHIPS. POSSIBLY FIND FACILITIES HOUSING AT OUR COLLEGES. OR TO REFORM FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE LEADERS OF THE STATE OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DAVE GEORGE I'M THE CEO OF THE SCHOOLS ACCESS LIABILITY FUND. WE ARE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY -- OUR MEMBERS -- COLLECTIVELY EDUCATE ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BETWEEN K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'VE SPENT OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND RISK MANAGEMENT RISK FINANCING AND LIABILITY CLAIMS. FOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES. WELL WE SUPPORT THE BILL'S INTENT OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO ONE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT AB THREE OH TWO WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INCURRED COSTS AND INCREASED LIABILITY IMPLICATIONS. FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE LIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE RAISED. BUT AS LONG AS AB THREE OH TWO REMAINS A MANDATE. TO ESTABLISH CA AS I LIVING FACILITIES FOR STUDENTS WITHIN THEIR CARS. THE BILL CREATES NUMEROUS AREAS OF POTENTIAL CIVIL LIABILITY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WELL THE BILL'S ANALYSIS ACTUALLY LAYS OUT MANY OF THOSE ISSUES -- WE BELIEVE IT UNDERESTIMATES LITIGATION RISK IN TWO WAYS. FIRST AS NOTED. WAIVERS OR LIMITED IMMUNITY. OFFER LIMITED PROTECTION. IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. WEATHER IS A WAIVER OR CONDITIONAL AND UNITY. THIS IS ALWAYS RESOLVED THROUGH THE COURTS AND THAT IS AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION ALL BY ITSELF FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. PUBLICATIONS IS LARGELY SELF INSURED. THROUGH JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SUCH AS SELF AND THEY HAVE DONE THIS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE DIRECTLY FINANCED THROUGH GENERAL FUND REVENUES. COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WHEN IT IS EMPLOYED AS A FINANCING TECHNIQUES IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE COSTS ASSEMBLY SPREAD THAT OUT OVER TIME. A SECOND HIGHLIGHT IN THE CASE THAT IS IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS THE BOARD OF REGENTS. FOR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. NOTED THAT THEY ESTABLISH. A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH COLLEGES. AND STUDENTS AND ESTABLISHES THIS DUTY. AS A PRACTICAL REALITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TWO MINUTES IS UP. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD PLEASE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. THEY SURE AWESOME WEBSTER BEHALF OF THE COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RANCHO SANTIAGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE KERN SAN BERNARDINO SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO AND YUBA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ALL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ASHLEY WALKER WITH NASA MEN ON BEHALF OF MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE AND NORTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. YOU'RE AWESOME BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PASADENA IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU. DAVID NEVIN ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNICATES DISTRICT IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BRINGING THIS BACK TO THE DíAS AGAIN THE ISSUE BEFORE US IS LIABILITY. ONE OF FOCUS ON THAT I THINK THAT -- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS THINKS THIS IS THE PANACEA. THIS IS A STOPGAP MEASURE SO -- I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE LIABILITY FOR MAKING THEIR PARKING FACILITIES AND OTHER FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN. THE SOMEONE WHO IS FROM FOLLOWING THE NEW BEGINNINGS PROGRAMME. FOR IS IT NOW FIFTEEN YEARS JUST FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY ACTUALLY BUT ANYWAY THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH GETTING OLD -- OF THE PROGRAM WORKS AND WHEN IT'S DONE PROPERLY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY. ANY COMPLAINTS THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY YEAH LAWSUITS FILED SO -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE IS A TEMPLATE THERE IS AN EXAMPLE THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I REALIZED THAT THEIR JOB IS TO EDUCATE BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I'M REMINDED THAT THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS WHO HAVE LITERALLY NO WHERE TO GO AND IN FACT WITH THE FOOD PANTRIES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HAVE WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO FOOD AND NO PLACE TO LIVE THAT IS JUST NOT THE WAY SOCIETY SHOULD OPERATE. AND WHILE I HOPE WE'RE FINALLY STARTING TO ADDRESS THAT I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN TERMS OF THE LIABILITY. I ISSUES ARE -- I THINK AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH THE THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD -- WE'RE NOT ASKING MORE I THINK THAN JUST THE BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WERE A SCHOOL WOULD HAVE DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. SO -- I I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL A CENTER Y. CASKEY. S. MY QUESTION WAS IS THAT THE LIABILITY EXIST ALREADY ON THE SCHOOLS HAVE SOME BAD THING HAPPENS WITH THE SCHOOL AND I UNDERSTAND BY HAVING MORE. STUDENTS ON CAMPUS THROUGH THE NIGHT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF SOMETHING HAPPEN BUT IS THERE SOMETHING [inaudible] EN. IS GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS TAKEN THAT WE GIVE NOTICE TO THE STUDENTS THAT THEY CAN ENSURE SAFETY WE HAD MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS. SO THAT THE STUDENTS. UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT THE RULES BEEN ADOPTED WE GET IF THEY'RE BAD ACTORS SAID DRINKING AND DOING THAT THEY'RE OUT -- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WERE OTHER THINGS WITHIN THE THE POLICY THE SELF INSURE POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE WOULD BE OTHER CRITERIA THAT WOULD -- LIMIT THAT LIABILITY OR FOR PROVIDE. MORE KNOWLEDGE TO THE STUDENTS AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE OR NOT -- BECAUSE I'VE I SEE THIS IS IS AN EXTENSION OF LIMITED LIABILITY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NOT CREATING ANY NEW RIGHTS AND MAYBE I'M WRONG. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL I I'D IF IF WE'RE WRONG THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT FROM FOLKS AND IF PEOPLE HAVE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS. THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL AND EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE MORE IF WE THINK THAT THEY'RE VALID IN ADDRESS VALID CONCERNS. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE GIVE THEM A LITTLE EXTRA PROTECTION THE UNIVERSE OF THE COLLEGES. THAT -- WERE EXTENDING THE WORLD WE'RE GIVING THEM A MUNITY FROM ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE OF THERAPY IF THEY'RE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH NO SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT IF THEY'RE TAKING ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS -- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE ASLEEP. ON CAMPUS IN THEIR CARS. IS THE WHOLE NOTION ACCIONES STITCHES THIS IS HARD TO IMAGINE BUT THEY GET TO GIVE ME A LITTLE IMMUNITY -- AS AN INCENTIVE I KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOBODY WANTS OF THOSE LIABILITIES SO THIS IS A WAY TO SORT OF GIVE. SOME -- ASSURANCES THAT IF YOU JUST ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY -- THAT THERE WILL BE THEIR PROTECTION THE REGION'S THERE'S THEIR EMPLOYEES [inaudible] OKAY. UNDER THE RAZA [inaudible] YEAH. WE WERE THAT. THE CENTER. IT OBVIOUSLY IS VERY BOTHERS SOME THAT. OUR SCHOOLS ARE. BUT NOW HAVE THIS AS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT THESE CONDITIONS WOULD EXIST. FOR STUDENTS -- AND IT'S INTERESTING ARCHER SAID FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WELL PROGRAM STARTED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO -- I THINK THAT THE THINKING BEHIND THIS OUGHT TO BE. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS WHAT WOULD YOU DO. IN A CASE WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR TEN TOFIFTEEN YEARS I DO NOT SEE. ANYTHING. THAT IS GOING TO LESSEN THAT LENGTH OF TIME [inaudible] UNLESS. WE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE MAKE IT OF SIMILAR TO A WILDFIRE EMERGENCY. IF WE DON'T TREAT A THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS. FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. SO WHAT. WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS LIABILITY -- I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU SAY IMMUNITIES WHO'S. THAT MEANS. THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE RIGHTS AS FAR AS SUING THEM IN THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A RIGHT OF PRIVATE ACTION DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T I MEAN WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IMMUNITY WHO'S GIVING. WHO WHAT? IS THE STUDENTS THAT WILL BE THE ONE TO BEAR WHATEVER. THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE OF COURSE IT'S THEM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL WHO CARES ABOUT. THE STUDENTS. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHEN YOU REFER TO THE LIABILITY OR MUNITY ISSUES WHOSE TAKE WHAT IS THAT TAKE CARE OF SO. WHO IS PROTECTED AND THAT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONCERN AND WHOSE PROTECTED AS FAR AS? THE STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED THAT'S ONE QUESTION ON THE OTHER QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF STUDENTS. I SUSPECT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE FAMILIES THAT THEY UNFORTUNATELY LIVE WITH THEM IN THE CARDS AND SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW AN ADDITIONAL ISSUE. SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY IS. THAT ALL THESE HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SO THAT WE DON'T -- UNFAIRLY PUT SOMETHING ON OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH THIS BEFORE SO. YOU KNOW THE TIME OF COURSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY. NOBODY WANTS TO JUST OPEN IT UP IN. YOU KNOW AND THINGS HAPPEN BAD THINGS COULD HAPPEN SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IN DOING THIS THAT IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY. HAVING ASKED ALL THOSE QUESTIONS IT I'M SURE YOU'LL HAVE ANSWERS TO OF COURSE I FEEL COMPELLED TO SUPPORT IT THIS IS NOT A A CHOICE THAT WE HAVE. IT'S A MATTER OF HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS. SO THAT THOSE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED IN THE RIGHT WAY. AND ARE WE READY HOW DO WE PREPARE AND GET READY FOR THAT. THANK YOU KNOW IF I MAY DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE TWENTY OF THE ANALYSIS AND TALKS ABOUT THIS. THE SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE LIABILITY ISSUE -- ITEM DE SAYS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THAT IS IMPLEMENTED OVERNIGHT PARKING THAT COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. OF SUBDIVISIONS BEING SEE IN THOSE ARE THE BASICS THAT WE'RE SETTING UP IS NOT CIVILLY LIABLE FOR DISTRICT EMPLOYEES GOOD FAITH ACT OR OMISSION. THAT FAILS TO PRESENT A TO PREVENT ANY INJURY TO A PARTICIPATING STUDENT THAT OCCURS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WIN DURING THE HOURS OF OPERATION. OF OVERNIGHT PARKING BUT THIS COMMUNITY DOES NOT APPLY TO GROSS NEGLIGENCE INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATIONS OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF LAW. SO WE BASICALLY TAKEN AWAY THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IF THEY PARTICIPATE AND I'M A BASICALLY IMPOSED A GOOD FAITH STANDARD IT'S A LESSER STANDARD NO QUESTION. BUT SO LONG AS THEY ARE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH AND COMPLYING WITH THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN THE BILL -- TO ON COVERAGE AND TO ALLOW FOR THIS. EVENING HOUSING -- OVERNIGHT HOUSING -- THERE THEY HAVE THAT IMMUNITY SO WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO DO IT AT THE SAME TIME GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT. ARE NOT PROTECTED [inaudible] CONSIDER MYSELF -- AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW THIS DOES MEAN THAT STUDENTS ARE YOU KNOW WILL NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUE. FOR THESE IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN I I WOULD THINK FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE INTO SO YOU CAN SPEAK MORE TO THAT THAT. IS JUST A WAY SAFER THAN WHERE THEY ARE NOW -- AND SO THIS IS A SLEEPING BY YOURSELF -- THE ISOLATED IN THE INDUSTRIAL PARK OR WALMART PARKING LOT OR AMONG THEM ALREADY WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER WITH CASKEY DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. ALL RIGHT WE'VE GOT A MOTION WILL ACCEPT THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES AND WITHOUT THE MOTION IS TO PASS. AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB THREE OH TO JACKSON JACKSON AYE PORGES GOOD ALSO. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I'D JONES MONNING STERN I'M BURKE. NUMBER TWO I WHITE HOUSE SKI WHAT HAS HE AYE. FIVE TO SIX FIVE TO ZERO WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR UPS MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU. OUR NEXT ITEM IS ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN IS FILE ITEM NINETEEN AB. SIX OH TWO GOING TO WATER -- WESTFIELD FEEL FREE. SB. SIX OH TWO FILE ITEM NINETEEN AB. SIX OH TWO WE HAVE WITNESSES HERE AGAIN I'M GOING TO ADMONISH YOU TWO MINUTES EACH AND I WILL CUT YOU OFF IF YOU GO BEYOND THAT VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. SIX OH TWO TODAY SB SIX SO TWO MIRRORS SB FIVE SIXTY FOUR AUTHORED BY SENATOR LEYVA WHICH THIS COMMITTEE PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR. FOR THIS REASON AND BECAUSE THERE ARE SIXTY SOME BILLS TO BE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M GONNA KEEP MY REMARKS. BRIEF -- BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK CENTER LEYVA FOR HER WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE THE CREATION OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED A AYE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER. TO CREATE COMMENCING STE WIFE LIKE IMAGES AND RECORDINGS OF AN INDIVIDUAL APPEARING TO DO OR SAY SOMETHING THEY DID NOT. THE SO CALLED DEEP FAKES DISTORT THE TRUTH MAKING IT HARDER TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REAL EVENTS AND ACTIONS FROM FICTION AND FANTASY. ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS LEGITIMATE AND BENEFICIAL USES PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO FILM MAKING. THEY CAN BE MISUSED IN POST PRODUCTION TO PORTRAY AN ACTOR PERFORMING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR SHOWING MORE NUDITY WITHOUT THE ACTORS CONSENT OR PARTICIPATION. SIMILARLY BECAUSE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE ONLINE ALONG WITH STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE USED IN A FAIRY IS SLATED TO PICK TO BOTH CELEBRITIES. AND NON CELEBRITIES AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT OR PARTICIPATION. STILL PHOTOS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S FACE CAN BE SCRAPED FROM THE INTERNET AND SEAMLESSLY GRAFTED ON A PORN STARS BODY AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE APPEARS TO BE A STRONG APPETITE FOR THIS CONTENT ONLINE. EVEN WHEN VIEWERS KNOW IT IS FAKE. BEYOND NATURAL FEELINGS OF EMBARRASSMENT APPEARING IN A SEXUALLY EXPLICIT DEEP FAKE CAN CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO A VICTIM'S REPUTATION JOHN PROSPECTS PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. IN A MENTAL HEALTH. SB SIX OR TWO WOULD HELP RESTORE CONTROL OVER AN INDIVIDUAL'S IMAGES OR LIKENESS BY REQUIRING CONSENT TO BE OBTAINED PRIOR TO DEPICTING A PERSON AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT MATERIAL. AND BY ALLOWING THAT CONSENT TO BE RESCINDED WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. WE HAVE BEEN HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION AND ARE CLOSE TO AN AGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE WORKING TO ADDRESS THE PSEUDONYM THE PSEUDO NAME IT THE SUD PSEUDONYMOUS. FILING PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. WHICH SHOULD REMOVE THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION WITH ME TODAY ARE ACTOR MICHELLE HEARD OR IS ACTOR MICHELLE HEARD HE'S ALSO A NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER FOR THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD -- THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S STILL AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HI I'M MICHELLE HEARD I'M AN ACTOR AND NATIONAL BOARD MEMBER SACK AFTER AND A FOUNDING MEMBER OF TIME'S UP I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL ACTOR FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TO SPEAK. ON THIS CRUCIAL BILL I'D LIKE TO THINK THUNDER LEVY LEVY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- BERMAN FOR OFFERING THIS BILL IN THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AB SIX OH TWO ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING PROBLEM IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS ACTORS PARTICULARLY FEMALE ACTORS. NEW TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW CONTENT CREATORS TO ALTER A PERSON'S IMAGE TO DEPICT THAT INDIVIDUALS ENGAGING IN SEXUAL ACTIVITY OR TO APPEAR AS PERFORMING IN THE NUDE WHEN NEITHER ACTUALLY OCCURRED. SO CALLED DEEP FAKE TECHNOLOGY IS OFTEN USED AS A TOOL OF EXPLOITATION AND HARASSMENT ON THE INTERNET HOWEVER IT CAN BE USED BY MAINSTREAM FILM MAKERS AS WELL. FILMMAKERS WITHOUT THE MEANINGFUL CONSENT OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED CAN DIGITALLY ALTER THE SCENE TO SHOW MORE NUDITY OR SEXUALLY EXPLICIT ACTS IN POST PRODUCTION ONCE THE DIGITALLY ALTERED FILM OR IMAGES OUT THERE IN THE WORLD ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. AND THE DAMAGE CAN BE LASTING AND PERMANENT. MY FELLOW FOR MY FELLOW ACTORS THIS TYPE OF NON CONSENSUAL DIGITAL DOUBLING IS AT ITS VERY CORE EXTREME WORKER EXPLOITATION UNFORTUNATELY THE LAW HASN'T INVOLVED AS FAST AS TECHNOLOGY TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF THING FROM OCCURRING. THIS IS WHY WE ARE WORKING SO HARD TO MAKE AB SIX OH TWO AND OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSED LAWS AROUND THE COUNTRY A LEGAL REALITY IF ENACTED THIS BILL WILL TRULY HELP PROTECT PERFORMERS AND OTHERS POTENTIALLY HARMED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDING. A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR CONSENT AND CIVIL REMEDIES TO COMPENSATE THE VICTIM WERE CONSENT ISN'T OBTAIN THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS BILL THIS DOESN'T JUST PROTECT PERFORMERS BUT ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO FALL PREY TO THESE HARMFUL PRACTICES ONLINE. OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS PREVENTION AND JUSTICE APPROACH WILL EVENTUALLY PUT AN END TO THIS EXPLOITIVE. BEHAVIOR WE'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE LATELY IN THE DIGITAL ERA ON BEHALF OF SAG AFTER AND MY FELLOW PERFORMERS WE SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROAD FOR SAG AFTRA OR SPONSORS A BABY SIX A TWO IS WELL AS THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF SINCE THE COMMITTEES ALREADY SEEN AN IDENTICAL VERSION THIS BILL IN LATE APRIL JUST AS AN UPDATE WE'VE CONTINUED OR CONVERSATIONS THE C.

FOR MORALLY OBJECTIONABLE THE WORKER BELIEVES THAT WOULD HAVE LASTING EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THEM. THE DEFENSE REALLY TAKE THAT RIGHT AWAY FROM WORKERS REALLY ROB THEM OF THAT IN A PARTICULARLY INSIDIOUS WAY THAT. AS MENTIONED DOES A LOT OF VERY LASTING DAMAGE TO THESE WORKERS AND WE THINK THIS IS A STRONG BILL THAT DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO TO HELP PREVENT THIS KIND OF THING FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT.

I KNOW THESE EIGHTY YEAR OLD PEOPLE DON'T LOOK LIKE THIRTY YEAR OLD STUDS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND YET IT'S PRETTY AUTHENTIC LOOKING SO. YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT'S REAL AND WHAT ISN'T REAL AND THAT IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE WORLD TODAY AND CERTAINLY IN A DEMOCRACY AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING -- WITH INTEGRITY AND AND CHARACTER AND ALSO APPRECIATE THE BILL I APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY IF YOU WOULD. PREFER YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECT THAT'S FROM A VOTE RIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX OH TWO JACKSON HI JACKSON FIVE LARGEST TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES. MORNING STERN ON BURKE. NUMBER I Y. CASKEY WHAT CASKEY I FIVE ZERO FIVE TO ZERO WE WILL KEEP THE ROLE OF THANK YU FOR BEING HERE. OUR NEXT ITEM I BELIEVE OF A ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN IS ONE MORE IT'S FILE ITEM. TWENTY FOUR MIGHT HAVE THREE MORE DID I MISS OUR THREE MORPHOLOGIES HOLY COW. ALL RIGHT -- I'M SORRY WE'VE GOT -- I'LL GO SO IT IS POSSIBLE ALL RIGHT -- THERE SO YOU DO HAVE THREE MORE BECAUSE ONE WAS PULLED OFF CONSENT YES MA'AM YOU'VE GOT FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR THEN AB SEVEN THIRTY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THE FIRST I'D REALLY LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. OF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WORKING LONG HOURS OVER THE HOLIDAY TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE -- AND NEAR THE SCOPE AS WELL AS FOR CENTER ON BERG'S PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT IN SENT ELECTIONS. I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. AB SEVEN THIRTY ADDRESSES. A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE HEADING INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS. AS MORE MORE BAD ACTORS TRY TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS WITH MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS THAT SO CONFUSION AND DOUBT THROUGHOUT THE ELECTORATE. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN VIDEO AUDIO AND IMAGES THAT THEY'RE BEING SHOWN. TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THEIR VOTE IN AN UPCOMING ELECTION HAVE BEEN MANIPULATED AND DO NOT REPRESENT REALITY. THIS IS ABOUT SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THIS TASK IS ONLY BECOME MORE CHALLENGING WITH THE INVENTION OF PROLIFERATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DEEP FAKES WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CONVINCING FABRICATED FODIO PHOTOS. VIDEO OR AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SOMEONE APPEARING TO SAY OR DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT SAY OR DO AS WE HEARD WITH THE LAST BILL AS WELL. THE ABILITY TO ATTRIBUTE SPEECH AND CONDUCT TO A CANDIDATE THAT IS FALSE THAT NEVER HAPPENED MAKES DEEP FACE A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS NEW TOOL IN THE ARSENAL OF THOSE. THAT WANT TO WAGE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN RECENTLY THAT VERY OLD IN CRUDE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO DISTORT REALITY. THE MANIPULATION OF THE VIDEO HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI WHO SPEECH WAS ALTERED. TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH SHE WAS DRUNK WAS VERY LOW QUALITY BUT WAS STILL VIEWED OVER THREE MILLION TIMES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS IS THE NEW FRONTIER IN THE MISINFORMATION WAR. THE CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE NOTES THAT DEEP FAKES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCITE VIOLENCE. ALTER ELECTION OUTCOMES IN UNDERMINE DIPLOMACY. IN JANUARY US DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DAN COATS WARNED THAT DEEP FIX WILL PROBABLY BE AMONG THE TACTICS USED TO THIS FOR UP THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. AND IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST IN CENTRAL AFRICA LAST YEAR A VIDEO OF THE BONES ALONG UNSEEN PRESIDENT ALI BONGO WHO WAS BELIEVED IN POOR HEALTH OR ALREADY DEAD. WAS DECRIED AS A DEEP FAKE BY HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CITED AS THE TRIGGER A WEEK LATER FOR AN UNSUCCESSFUL COUP BY THE GOVERNOR HE'S MILITARY. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT CHEN SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHARED A DEEP FAKE OF DONALD TRUMP. URGING BELGIUM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT SIGNATURES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED PETITION. LAST MONTH MONTH THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE LED BY CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. CONVENE A HEARING ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MANIPULATED MEDIA IN DEEP FAKES. NOTING THAT DEEP AKES RAISE PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS WITH INDIVIDUALS AND VOTERS NO LONGER ABLE TO TRUST THEIR OWN EYES OR EARS WHEN ASSESSING THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHAT THEY SEE ON THEIR SCREENS. THIS IS A NONPARTISAN ISSUE. AT A U. S. SENATE INTELLIGENCE HEARING SENATOR MARCO RUBIO SAID THAT HE EXPECTED DEEP FAKES WILL BE USED IN THE NEXT WAVE OF ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICAN AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS AROUND THE CORNER WE MUST DO MORE TO CURB THE PROLIFERATION OF DEEP FAKES AND OTHER MANIPULATED MEDIA. SPEAKER MARCO RUBIO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES. I WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT NO COURT THAT I'M AWARE OF HAS FOUND THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT GRANTS SOMEONE THE RIGHT TO LITERALLY PUT THEIR WORDS INTO MY MOUTH. WHICH IS WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY DOES. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR AND DEAN OF UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW IRWIN CHEMERINSKY WHICH SPEAKS TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF AB. SEVEN THIRTY NOW WE WILL USE THIS CLICHE SHE OR HE WROTE THE BOOK ON IT WHEN REFERRING TO SOMEONE WITH EXPERTISE. WHAT THE INSURANCE KILO LITERALLY WROTE THE BOOK ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW THAT'S USING LAW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY? NONETHELESS I HAVE AGREED TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AB SEVEN THIRTY WOULD PROHIBIT A PERSON COMMITTEE OR ENTITY WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF AN ELECTION FROM. WITH ACTUAL MALICE DISTRIBUTING IT MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL MEDIA OF A CANDIDATE WITH THE INTENT TO INJURE THE CANADA'S REPUTATION OR TO DECEIVE A VOTER INTO VOTING FOR OR AGAINST THE CANDIDATE. UNLESS THE MEDIA INCLUDES A DISCLOSURE STATING THAT IT IS BEEN MANIPULATED. THE BILL WOULD DEFINE MATERIALLY DECEPTIVE AUDIO OR VISUAL MEDIA TO MEAN AN IMAGE OR AN AUDIO OR VISUAL RECORDING THAT HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY MANIPULATED TO ALTER THE APPEARANCE SPEECH OR CONDUCT OF A CANDIDATE. SO AS TO CREATE A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD OF CAUSING A REASONABLE PERSON TO UNDERSTAND HER EXPERIENCE THE EXPRESSIVE CONTENT OF THE IMAGE OF RECORDING. IN A MATTER THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM UNDERSTANDING OR EXPERIENCE THE PERSON WHAT IT WOULD HAVE IF THE PERSON WE'RE SEEING OR HEARING THE ON ALTERED ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE IMAGE OR RECORDING. THESE TEN THESE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO CLARIFY THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE MANIPULATION. AND THE FALSITY OF THE SPEECH AND CONDUCT ATTRIBUTED TO A CANDIDATE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS THIS AND I THINK -- MANY OF US WE'VE HAD -- PROFESSOR DEAN CHEMERINSKY MANY TIMES I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUARREL ABOUT HIS EXPERTISE AND I ALWAYS APPRECIATE HIS. ANALYSIS WHICH I THINK REFLECTS A NUMBER THE AMENDMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN AND NARROW THE BILL SO THAT HE DOES BELIEVE AND I CERTAINLY AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE WITH HIM. THAT IT IS NOW CONSTITUTIONAL CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE SO DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEVEN ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE PROUD THE CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- I'LL START BY NOTING I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTER FROM PROFESSOR CHEMERINSKY I CERTAINLY -- DON'T. ENJOY BEING IN THE POSITION OF DISAGREEING WITH HIM BUT I THINK I DO HAVE TO IN THIS SITUATION. TO BE CLEAR WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A. B. SEVEN THIRTY NOT BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL FAR FROM IT WE AGREE THAT. PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT WE RECOGNIZE THE TROUBLING USES. THAT DEPICTS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE PUT TO HOWEVER WE DON'T BELIEVE AB SEVEN THIRTY IS THE SOLUTION. THOUGH WELL INTENTIONED AB SEVEN THIRTY UNDERMINES THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS IT'S OVER BROAD INEFFECTIVE AND UNNECESSARY THE BILL'S OVER BROAD. BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO ANY IMAGE OR RECORDING THAT'S BEEN MANIPULATED -- AND AS STATED IN THE AMENDMENTS SO THAT A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE OF THE EXPRESSIVE CONTENT AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL. THIS COULD APPLY TO A WHOLE HOST OF LEGITIMATE PROTECTED FORMS OF EXPRESSION FOR EXAMPLE. CONSIDER A POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT THAT ATTACKS A CANDIDATE FOR MISSING VOTES THAT INCLUDES AN IMAGE OF THE CANDIDATES WHICH THEY'VE ADDED -- A GOLF BAG CONTINUE IN THE PERSON MISTER VOTES BECAUSE THEY WERE GOLFING. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY THIS BILL EVEN IF THEY CAN'T IT WAS IN FACT GOLFING. THE BILL'S INEFFECTIVE A PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE OF RESOLUTION OF AND CLAIMS BEFORE AN ELECTION AND AS NOTED IN THE NOW SAYS. EVEN IN THE EVENT OF COURT ISSUED A RULING BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT'S UNLIKELY THE STOP THE SPREAD OF THESE RECORDINGS ON THE DARK CORNERS OF THE INTERNET. AND EVEN IF THE BILL WORKS AS INTENDED IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT LABELING SOMETHING IS MANIPULATED GIVES LEAVES VOTERS BETTER INFORMED. AND PARTICULARLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE MANIPULATION HAS BEEN MINOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT MATERIAL -- IT COULD ACTUALLY LEAVE THE VOTER WITH A MISIMPRESSION AS TO WHAT IS REAL AND NOT REAL IN THAT -- IMAGE OR RECORDING. FINELY THE THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY DEEP FAKES ARE AN OLD PROBLEM IN NEW CLOTHES THIS INFORMATION IS NOT NEW WE HAVE TWO VERY POWER LIKE YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU MANAGER MEMBERS. OF MY NAME'S MARK POWERS AND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS SERVING YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AS I SAID ELECTIONS COMMITTEE LAST WEEK A FEDERAL LAW PROVENCHER BROADCASTERS FROM COMPLYING WITH THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ANALYSIS HAS LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO BE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. IN ADDITION TO WHAT -- WHITNEY SAID WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE ACTUAL PROCESS OVERSEE SHINS REMOVING DEEP FAKES IS GOING TO WORK. WHERE THERE MAY BE NO WAY TO DETECT THEM? AND THE TIME FRAME IS SO SHORT. IT SEEMS WE'RE GOING TO COUNT ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO PRIORITIZE THESE CASES AND A JUDGE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION IF THE PICTURE AUDIO OR VISUAL IS FATE. AT THAT POINT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW AS GOING TO PROVIDE THE MEDIA IN YOUR DISTRICT WITH THE RULING SO THEY KNOW IT'S FAKE HOPEFULLY. BUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS PUNISH THE MEDIA IF THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. NOT JUST KNOWN BUT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. ABOUT REQUIRES ACTUAL MALICE BY EVERYONE ELSE THIS PLACE IS THE MEDIAN THE POSITION OF A JUDGE. AND A JURY AND THAT WILL HAND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS AND ADDITIONAL TACTIC TO TRY AND FORCE ADS OFF THE AIR BY THREATENING LITIGATION. A DEEP THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH THIRD PARTY ADS PROBABLY FROM OUT OF STATE COMMITTEES. SO WHEN YOUR STATIONS PUT A DISCLAIMER ON AN AD TO AVOID THE AB SEVEN THIRTY PENALTIES AFTER AN OPPOSING THIRD PARTY COMMITTEE COMPLAINS ABOUT. AND IF THAT STATION GUESSES WRONG AFTER THAT DISCLOSURE THEY GET A DEFAMATION SUIT. AS A REWARD. THESE COMMITTEES WON'T CARE ABOUT A REASONABLE FEES AS A DETERRENT FOR FALSE CLAIMS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE GONE. LONG BEFORE THAT PROCESS SENS THIS PROCESS REQUIRES FAX NOT GUESSES YOUR DISTRICT MEDIA SHOULD NOT BE MAKING A TRUE FALSE DETERMINATION ON YOUR POLITICAL SPEECH. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I'M SURE MEMBERS KEVIN BACON FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WITH ALL RESPECT TO PROFESSOR CHEMERINSKY OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT THE BILL DOES INTRUDE ON AND THAT'S WHAT A GOOD LAWSUIT IS MADE OFF. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- ARE BRINGING IT BACK. TO THE DíAS -- CENTER WHITE HOUSE CAN I ALSO HAVE TO EXCUSE MYSELF TO GO VOTING NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGERS JUST LOOKING FOR SOME CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I'M PLATE PAGE TO THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT IMAGE VIDEO AND AUDIO AND I THINK I KNOW WHAT. SO IT DOESN'T TAKE PICTURE BUT IT I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE VIDEO IS AN AUDIO IS DO WE HAVE AND IT'S NOT THE FINE WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S. BEING SWEPT UP OVER WHAT'S INCLUDED YEAH GREAT QUESTION CENTER AND A WHAT WE NEED TO BE INCLUDED IS IS PHOTORAPHS -- SO NOT NOT ANYTHING THAT WAS DRAWN OR ARTISTICALLY CREATED BUT BUT IF. PHOTOGRAPH THAT WAS TAKEN AND DIGITALLY MANIPULATED TO TO CREATE THIS THIS DIFFERENT. EXPERIENCE OR IMPRESSION ON A ON A PERSON. OKAY AND AND IT YEAH I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY -- TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND AND ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T GET TO THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SAY IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL -- ANSWER THE PASS OUT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I FULLY INTEND TO SPEND THE SUMMER RESOURCES SUMMER RECESS. CONTINUING TO FINE TUNE THE LANGUAGE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT ARE -- YOU KNOW BROUGHT UP TODAYAND THEN MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS NEW I KNOW THIS IS. GOING OUT -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S THIS IS NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY WERE TRYING TO APPLY THE EXISTING WANT TO AND AND I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME. TO GET RIGHT. BOTH TEACHERS IN GERMAN SKIS LETTER CLEARLY POINTS OUT ABOUT IT WE DON'T PROTECT. FALSE AND DECEPTIVE -- HAD A SPEECH YES SIR IN [inaudible] I AGREE. MAN ARTS CENTER DRAWS YEAH -- I AM NOT A LAWYER. AND I DON'T PRETEND TO TRY TO GIVE ALL THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS HERE. BUT I CAN SAY IS THAT IT I'M EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. WITH MOVING FORWARD ON SOMETHING THAT IS SO PRECIOUS TO US. TO US. AND HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CAMPAIGNS POLITICAL AND OTHERWISE. IT'S IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS THING WITHOUT HAVING HAD. A MUCH MUCH MORE. A MUCH DEEPER MUCH BROADER. REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH -- VIEW OF HOW WE GO FORWARD WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT'S NOT TO PROTECT YOU KNOW THE SCUMBAGS THAT DO WHAT THEY DO -- AND LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THAT IT'S JUST TOO PRECIOUS A A RIGHT AND SO. I I'M WITH YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I'M NOT. I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING IN WHICH I STILL FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH. AND JUST BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE THOUGHT THROUGH THANK YOU BUT THANK YOU. FOR TAKING ON THE SCUMBAG THANK YOU SENATOR AND AND I I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE -- YEAH THE THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT -- IN IN IN AMERICA AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS NOT ABSOLUTE -- AND AND IT DOESN'T APPLY THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO IT. I THINK WE'VE NEARLY TAYLOR THE BILL TO TO FIT THAT SWEET SPOT -- BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S MORE WORK THAT WE STILL NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR AND AND SO THAT WE DON'T SWEEP UP. UNINTENDED ACTIVITIES -- ORG UNINTENDED SPEECH THAT WE DON'T MEAN. TO TO HAVE SWEPT UP IN THIS I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHEN WE START WERE SORT OF WORKING ON THE BILL. BUT I WOULD JUST GONNA TARGET DEEP FAKES THAT WOULD AT LEAST BE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT AS THE SAME NEGATIVE. IMPACTS -- AND IS THE SAME IN MY MIND INAPPROPRIATE MANIPULATION OF MEDIA OF CONTENT OF OFF THE VIDEO IN THAT EXAMPLE TO TURN SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED INTO SOMETHING THAT DID NOT -- SO -- IT YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S STICKY -- BUT I THINK IT IT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY I DO NOT WANT TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WE WERE THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN WE REALIZE -- SHOOT I WISH WE TAKING THIS MORE SERIOUSLY THIS WHOLE FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND THEN MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN THING IS SERIOUS AND ACTUALLY WORKS -- AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ATTEMPTING TO DO.

ELEVEN FORTY SIX WOULD MAKE EXPLICIT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WITH PASSAGE OF OUR LANDMARK CONSUMER PRIVACY BILL LAST YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER MAY RETAIN VEHICLE AND OWNERSHIP INFORMATION IN ORDER TO SHARE IT WITH AN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING WARRANTY WORK FOR MANY FACTORS RECALL. NEW VEHICLES ARE COVERED BY MANUFACTURER WARRANTY THAT ALLOWS FOR REPAIRS TO BE MADE TO THE VEHICLE AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER LIKEWISE WHEN THERE'S A SAFETY DEFECT RECALL THE VEHICLE CAN BE REPAIRED AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER. BUT INFORMATION SHARING IS NECESSARY TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS AND EFFECTUATE REPAIRS THE BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED ONLY TWO ACCOMPLICES OBJECTIVE AND CONSUMER WOULD RETAIN THEIR OTHER RIGHTS AND CONSUMER REMEDIES UNDER THE LAW A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MY NAME IS KERR CAM I'M WITH IHS MARKET AUTOMOTIVE.

BOTH NEW AND USED AND WE COMBINE THAT TO FIND THE BEST ADDRESS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE RECALL NOTICE FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO THE CONSUMERS. WE ARE A KEY LINK IN THE PROCESS AND MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE STATE A WE UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A GAP THAT'S BEEN CREATED AND IT COULD IMPACT SAFETY. ARE THERE FOR THE AMENDMENT IS NEEDED SO THAT THE MANUFACTURERS AND THE DEALERS CAN SHARE THE DATA WITH THE RECALL SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THAT WE CAN RETAIN IT AS WELL. WITHOUT THE AMENDMENT AS I SAID SAFETY MAY BE IMPACTED WE WORK ON INNOVATIVE HEIGHTS HAS MARKET -- AUTOMOTIVE WORKS ON INNOVATIVE RECALL SOLUTIONS WITH -- NUMBER OF AUTOMAKERS -- SIX IN PARTICULAR -- FOR JUST THOSE SIX AUTOMAKERS WE THERE ARE WELL OVER ONE MILLION.

HUNDRED FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT AND ALMOST FOUR MILLION BORROWERS. AND THIS IS THE SECOND LARGEST AMOUNT OF DEBT AFTER HOME LOANS AFTER MORTGAGES AND YET THERE'S VERY LITTLE IF ANY REGULATION. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN WORKING WITH CFPB AND TRYING TO PUT SOME REGULATIONS AND IN PLACE WELL ACTUALLY THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF OF EDUCATION. THEY COMPLETELY BACKED OFF OF ANY THOSE PROTECTIONS AND AS YOU KNOW WE RAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO A BILL TO BRING STUDENTS SERVICERS INTO A LICENSING PROGRAM. ADD IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO A LINE. CALIFORNIA'S LICENSING PROGRAM WITH FEDERAL RULES. ALL THE FEDERAL RULES ONE WAY. THE COMPANION PIECE TO THE LICENSING WHICH IS LICENSING THE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS IS THIS BILL AND IT'S GIVING STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY IN HOW THEY'RE TREATED BY THIS TO LOAN SERVICERS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE RIGHTS THAT THEY CAN ENFORCE IN FACT THE LARGEST STUDENT LOAN SERVICER HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR AND IN. TESTIFIED IN COURT THAT. CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPECTATION THAT THE SERVICE OR WILL BE OPERATING IN THEIR BEST INTEREST THAT IS SHAMEFUL THIS IS A BILL TO FIX THAT. WE ARE GIVING STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS SOME OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO MAKE SURE THEY GET OUT OF DEBT INAPPROPRIATE MATTER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IS OFFICIALLY AS POSSIBLE DON'T GET DRAGGED ON THROUGH THE PROCESS UNNECESSARILY. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU -- WITNESSES OF TWO MINUTES AT THE MOST PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. MY NAME IS CODY UNION MY BILL THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWER AND PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT STUDENT DEBT CRISIS FOR ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF ONE MILLION. SUPPORTERS IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS. I'M ALSO HERE TO ECHO THE VOICES OF FELLOW CO SPONSORS THE STUDENT BAR PROTECTION CENTER. I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA IN A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF SANTA CREADA. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS CLEAR FOR MY GRANDPARENTS WHO CAME TO LOS ANGELES AS OUR MILLION REFUGEES. EDUCATION WAS IMPORTANT PART OF THAT DREAM. EVEN HELP ME ACHIEVE IT. WHEN I GRADUATE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AFTER YEARS OF TUITION INCREASES I WAS CARRYING OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT? ON TOP OF THAT MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE SOLD DURING NINETY THOUSAND STUDENT DEBT THEMSELVES. THREE GENERATIONS OF CANADIANS WERE NOW REPAYMENT IN REPAYMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE HAD VIRTUALLY ZERO GUIDANCE FOR A LOAN SERVICERS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB THREE SEVEN SIX THE STUDENT BAR BILL OF RIGHTS BECAUSE I'VE EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND WHAT HAPPENS TO CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES. WHEN LOAN SERVICERS ARE ALLOWED TO RUN AMOK? MY FIRST TWO KNOWN BILLS OVER FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND I REST MY SERVICE SERVER HELP. AT THE TIME I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THE MOST AFFORDABLE FEDERAL REPAYMENT PROGRAM. HOWEVER I WAS MISLED ABOUT MY OPTIONS IN PLACE A REPAYMENT PLAN WITH HIGHER MONTHLY PAYMENTS. THE ALSO EXTEND MY REPAYMENT PLAN BY OVER HALF A DECADE. SEVERAL YEARS LATER MY LOAN SERVICER SAYING AN EMAIL WITH INCORRECT DEADLINE FOR THE MANDATORY YOU THEY WERE CERTIFICATION. THAT MAYBE MISS AYE DEADLINE CAUSING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BE ADDED TO MY LOAN BALANCE AND MY MONTHLY PAYMENT TRIPLED. DESPITE CLEAR FEELINGS MY LOAN SERVICING COMPANY THERE IS NO NO ONE TO TURN TO TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. I WAS NOT ALONE. MY PARENTS WERE PUSHED INTO FORBEARANCE AND REPAYMENT OPTIONS AT COST THEM MORE MONEY AND TIME. EVEN AFTER MY MOTHER COULD NO LONGER WORK DUE TO A DISABILITY THE LOAN SERVICER FILL TO INFORM THEM THAT THEY MAY QUALIFY FOR TOTAL AND PERMANENT LOAN DISCHARGE. WHEN MY TWIN BROTHER FIRST RESPONDER LOS ANGELES BECAUSE -- TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. HE QUALIFIED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS. YEAH HIS LOAN SERVICER FIELD TO COMMUNICATE THE SUPPORT PROGRAM. INSTEAD OF MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS LOAN FULL FULL LOAN FORGIVENESS HE'S BEEN YEARS AND BE PAYMENT THAT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

YOU KNOW WE DON'T WITH IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO THIS LOOK VERY ECHO TROUBLING LEE SIMILAR TO THE HOME ON A BILL OF RIGHTS ISSUE WHEN MORTGAGE SERVICERS WERE LETTING PEOPLE SLIDE INTO DEFAULT IN FORECLOSURE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ANY STANDARDS.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH. HAPPENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SCOTT YOU CAN I AM HERE ON BEHALF THIS TUNE ONE SERVICING ALLIANCE. WE ARE NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION OF STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS IN THE FEDERAL AND STUDENT LOAN MARKET PLACE MOSTLY PRIVATE NON PROFIT AND STATE AGENCIES. OUR MEMBER SERVICE ABOUT 95% OF ALL STUDENT LOANS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX TRILLION OF WHICH ARE OUTSTANDING TODAY -- BUT SOME FACTS ARE CRITICAL IN THIS DISCUSSION SERVICERS DO NOT MAKE THESE LOANS WE DO NOT RECEIVE THE INTEREST OR PROCEEDS FROM THEM. INTEREST RATES FOR PAYMENT OPTIONS AND BENEFITS ARE OUTSIDE OFOUR CONTROL FOR FEDERAL LOANS ALL THOSE COST AND LOAN BALANCE PROCEDURES ARE SET BY CONGRESS. WHAT WE CAN CONTROL THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AND HAVE ROBUST PROCESSES IN PLACE? TO RESOLVE ANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS THE REALITY IS A CORNER THE CFPB THAT LESS THAN ZERO ZERO POINT 6%. OF ALL CONSUMER FINANCIAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT STUDENT LOAN RELATED ISSUES AND OF THOSE 85% OR RESULT BY JUST EXPLAINING THE TERMS OF THE LOAN TO THE BAR. THOSE ARE NOT SERVICE OR ISSUES. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH CURRENT PROVISIONS IN AB THREE SEVENTY SIX COULD MAKE SERVICING MORE COSTLY YOUR MORE CONFUSING FOR BORROWERS. FIRST THE A BILL PROVIDES BROAD PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OUR MEMBERS COULD BE SUED EVEN WHEN A REGULAR REGULATORS FOUND NO FACTUAL BASIS FOR ACTION AGAINST SERVICERS. AT BEST THIS COULD DECREASE SERVICES FOR ALL BORROWERS WOULD BE BURDENSOME ON THE TOTAL COST OF THE LOAN PROGRAM THE PROPOSED CHANGES THAT WE HOPE WILL BE TAKEN WITH TO WORK TOGETHER ON THOSE. SECOND THE MARKET MONITORING MISSIONS IN THE BILL OF BEEN REJECTED BY OTHER REGULATORS BECAUSE THEY DON'T TO COLLECT INFORMATION WHICH MAY NOT BE PERMITTED UNDER CONFLICTING FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATION. THEY ALSO CRITICIZED ANGEL BURDENS BEST ON SMALLER NONPROFIT SERVICERS AND ARE DUPLICATIVE LASTLY PAYMENT APPLICATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO GET RIGHT. BUT THE TERM IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BORROWER IS COMPLETELY UNDEFINED SINCE MANY BOARDS HAVE DIFFERENT WERE PAYMENT GOALS AND DESIRED OUTCOMES WE PROPOSE CHANGES THAT ENSURE THE EXACT SAME MORE FLEXIBILITY. INTENDED AS A CHEAP BUT ALSO MAKES IMPLEMENTING THOSE OPTIONS PRACTICALLY ACHIEVABLE FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED VISIT CURVE -- POSITION ON THE BILL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS BUT ONLY AS TO THE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. THE BILL ALLOWS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES OF FIVE HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER. VIOLATION PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES AND HAS A PROVISION IT'S KIND OF A QUIZ ON A CLASS ACTION PROVISION THAT COULD LEAD TO LAWSUITS THAT ARE MORE ABOUT MONEY THAN ABOUT JUSTICE. AS YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE PROBABLY KNOW. OF CALIFORNIA HAS VERY -- PERMISSIVE RULES REGARDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS BUT WE DO HAVE REQUIREMENTS -- FOR A CERTIFYING A CLASS CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AT THE CLASS MUST BE ASCERTAINABLE BUT HAVE COMMON ISSUES OF ON FACTS. THE CLAIM OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFF MUST BE TYPICAL OF THOSE OF THE OTHER CLASS MEMBERS. AND THE NAME TO REPRESENTATIVE MUST ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THE OTHER CLASS MEMBERS IN ADDITION THE CLASS MECHANISM MUST BE A SUPERIOR WAY OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW PEOPLE TO SEE YOU ON BEHALF OF OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT -- PROVIDES AND THAT MAKES US SEE JACK NERVOUS FOR THOSE THAT REASON -- WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED PREVENT -- POSITION ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT SECTION AQ THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. VENTURE AND SENATORS COMMINGLED WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. PROPER WILL SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FIND IT INTERESTING WHEN THE DEFENSE'S ALL OR WHEN THE OPPOSITION IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE ABILITY TO SUE. NOW IF YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG A LAWSUIT IS IN A WORK SO -- OF I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN I DON'T I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH IN TERMS OF Y. E. GIVING. THESE CONSUMERS OF RIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE ISN'T A GOOD THING. COMING OUT OF SCHOOL WITH A DEBT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A BAD THING -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS GENERATIONAL I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE. BACK IN THE OLDER DAYS WHEN THE COST OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WAS FIFTY DOLLARS A SEMESTER -- ED THAT THOSE TO THE OLD DAYS THEY DON'T HAPPEN MUCH BUT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDENTS WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR CARS TO COME OUT OF SCHOOL WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT. THIS IS OUR FUTURE. THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE TO OUR FUTURE WE'VE MORTGAGED IT TO THE HILT. AND THE IDEA THAT AT LEAST YOU'D HAVE A PROGRAM HERE TO GIVE GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO STUDENTS I THINK IT'S JUST A NO BRAINER AND SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THE BILL AND I THINK THAT IF THERE ARE CONCERNS -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- PERHAPS WE CAN BE THE GUIDE FOR HOW TO DO IT RIGHT SO WITH THAT. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION -- YOU WANTED TO MOVE THE BILL. WE'LL LET YOU MOVE THE BILL BECAUSE YOU MOVED A LOT OF ON ALL RIGHT OKAY GOOD WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER GONZALEZ. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU JUST TO SAY THAT WHEN CALIFORNIA PASSED THE STUDENT SERVICE OUR LICENSING PROGRAM AT LEAST A DOZEN STATES HAVE FOLLOWED. OUR LEAD THEIR M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ÁI&lt;/c&gt;</u> STATES ARE WATCHING WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES NOW THIS IS CRITICAL FOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS NATIONWIDE. LET'S LEAD THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE ABOUT THANK YOU. ARE THE VOTE IS THE MOTION RATHER IS TO PASS. TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN A. B. THREE SEVENTY SIX JACKSON. HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ AND SALAS AYE JONES. MONNING STERN -- BURKE HI NUMBER TWO I WHAT CASKEY WHAT HAS HE AYE FIVE THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND AGREED TO GIVE SAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD -- PRIORITY WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH HIS COMMITTEE HE HAS ONE BILL AND YOU'VE GOT. THREE SO IF YOU IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF WE ALLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD TO GO FIRST. CLEARLY AGE BEFORE BEAUTY SO -- WE'LL DO THAT AND I HAVE GOT TO GO VOTE SO I'M GONNA GIVE THE FILE ITEM. TWENTY SEVEN AB. EIGHT EIGHT TWO FOUR AND AGAIN WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. PLEASE NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES EACH TO WITNESSES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL EXCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS AND I HAVE COMMITTED TO TAKE IN. I HAVE I I ACCEPT ALL THE MINIMUM SITE HAVE COMMITTED TO TAKEN SUBMITTED AND SENATE HEALTH. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL DIFFER WHAT IS KNOWN AS PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN GENERIC AND BRAND. MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO DELAY MARKETING A GENERIC VERSION OF A DRUG FOR SOMETHING OF VALUE. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES THIS BY ESTABLISHING THE STANDARD REVIEW FOR THE COURTS TO USE WHEN RIVER REVIEWING PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. THE FTC HAS SOUGHT TO USE THEIR AUTHORITY THROUGH ENFORCEMENT TO STOP THESE PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS. BUT AS LONG AS TEN YEARS AGO THEY CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO STOP THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS. SO FAR CONGRESS HAS FAILED TO ACT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. THE INCREASED COST OF ANTI COMPETITIVE AGREEMENTS AFFECTS EVERYONE WHO PAYS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE STATE. EMPLOYERS AND CONSUMERS THE BILL ESTABLISHES. A PRESUMPTION THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. THE DRUNK UP DRUG COMPANIES WILL HAVE THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THESE SETTLEMENTS ARE PRO CONSUMER. OR PRO COMPETITIVE THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS IT IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO ACQUIRE THE INFORMATION FROM THE DRUG COMPANIES TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE POTENTIALLY BRING. UP A GENERIC DRUG TO MARKET SOONER BUT IS IT REALLY ALWAYS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMER. I'VE ASKED FOR EXAMPLES FROM THE INDUSTRY AND THUS FAR HAVE THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED A SINGLE ONE THAT ILLUSTRATES THE AGREEMENT IS PRO COMPETITIVE. YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR FROM OF REPRESENTATIVE FROM FARMER TODAY AND REPRESENTING FROM THE GENERICS BOTH ARGUING AGAINST THE BILL AND YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD. SURELY THERE MUST BE A LOSER HERE I WOULD CONTEND IT'S THE CONSUMER. IMAGINE FOR YOURSELF THAT A BRAND NAME DRUG MANUFACTURER ENTERS INTO AN AGREEMENT WHERE GENERIC CAN GAIN ENTRY TO THE MARKET SOONER THAN THE EXPIRATION OF THE PATENT. AND USUALLY THAT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL PATTEN IT'S A SECONDARY ONE FOR TERTIARY ONE OR ONE THIS BEEN GOING ON THAT WERE SOMETHING HAS BEEN EVERGREEN FOR MANY YEARS SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD RIGHT. WELL NOW THE DEAL MIGHT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE BRAND NAME MANUFACTURER COULD SAY MAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE PRESCRIPTION. RECOGNIZING THAT ONCE THE GENERIC ENTERS THE MARKET THE GENERIC MIGHT SELL FOR TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THE BRANDING COULD OFFER TO ALLOW EARLY ENTRY AT THE GENERIC GENERIC SELLS. FOR THIRTY FIVE THE NEAR GENERIC WINS BY BEING ABLE TO INTRODUCE THEIR DRUG AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE TYPICAL COMPETITION MIGHT ALLOW. THE BRAND NAME WITH WINS BY TAKING LESS OF A HIT. THEY BOTH WIN. BUT THE AGREEMENT IS ANTI COMPETITIVE AND CONSUMERS LOSE THIS IS A VARIATION OF POSSIBLE AGREEMENT IT WAS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FTC IN A HE ANY HEARING TO CONGRESS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE YOU'LL HEAR SEVERAL ARGUMENTS FROM DRUG COMPANIES TODAY INCLUDING. ONE THERE IS ONLY ONE PAY FOR TO A SETTLEMENT IN THE F. T. C.'S A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT ON THE SECOND ACTIVITIES OUR THIS IS MISLEADING. IN THE SAME REPORT THE FTC IS ALSO SAID THAT THE NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS WITH POSSIBLE COMPENSATION TO THE GENERIC. COMPANY PROVISIONS THAT MIGHT ACT AS COMPENSATION THE REQUIRED FURTHER INQUIRY INTO SPECIFIC MARKETPLACE MARKETPLACE CIRCUMSTANCES ACTUALLY INCREASED. TO FOURTEEN THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE CHANGING THE FACE OF INCREASED SCRUTINY WHICH ACTUALLY REINFORCES THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION. THE FTC NEEDS TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THESE AGREEMENTS BEFORE THEY CONCLUDE THEY'RE NOT PAY FOR DELAY. SOME DRUG COMPANIES WILL ALSO WANT GLUCK'S TO EXCLUDE GLOBAL SETTLEMENTS FOR THIS BILL WE'RE NOT X. ELIMINATING THESE TYPES AGREEMENTS THE DRUG COMPANIES MUST SIMPLY SHOW WHY THIS TYPE OF GREEN AS PRO COMPETITIVE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF POTENTIAL GLOBAL SETTLEMENT GENERIC MIGHT AGREE TO DELAYED PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES IN EXCHANGE FOR BEING ABLE TO USE IN A FOREIGN MARKET. A WIN FOR THE BRAND NAME WIN FOR THE GENERIC BUT ONCE AGAIN THIS TIME IT'S A LITTLE LOSS FOR CONSUMERS. THE BILL BY DEFINITION RELATES ONLY TO THE SALES OF DRUGS US APPROVED DRUGS IN THE U. S. WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE SAILOR PRICING DRUGS OUTSIDE THE U. S.. FINALLY YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE HAD A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND SENATE HEALTH. BUT LET ME ASSURE YOU THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. CALIFORNIA'S ANTI TRUST LAW THE CART RIGHT ACT ALREADY ALLOWS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT. WE LISTEN TO CONCERNS FROM THE DRUG OF THE COMPANY INDUSTRY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AFTER EVERY HEARING ANOTHER ONE POPS UP AND IN GOOD FAITH WE'VE NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WHILE ENSURING THAT THE BILL REMAINS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS SO MOVING FORWARD I'LL BE TROUBLE TO LEARN ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL NEW CONCERNS. OF LEAD THE BILL BEFORE YOU AS AMENDED TODAY'S A GOOD BILL AND A MODIFY FOR THAT THE REQUEST THE DRUG INDUSTRY FURTHER DEFEATS IS PRO CONSUMER PURPOSE. COST CONTAINMENT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND HEALTH CARE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED COSTS AFFECT WHAT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT PEOPLE PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR DOES JUST THAT ENSURE THE CONSUMERS OF ACCESS TO LOWER COST GENERIC DRUGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE NOW SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE PRICE DRUGS BUT JUST A PRICE OF DRUGS FOR ALL PAIRS. THIS IS A COMPLICATED BILL BUT AS YOU LISTEN TO TESTIMONY PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND. AGREEMENTS THAT THE LAY THE INTRODUCTION OF A GENERIC COST CONSUMERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THREATENED PATIENTS ABILITIES TO FOR THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY THE A SOMEONE FROM THE A. R. P.. AND AND WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND WE ALSO HAVE TECHNICAL SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RUNNING A GEORGE I AM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD FOR HIS. LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS ERA IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE HIGH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST COLLUSIVE PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENT. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE A NECESSARY TOOL TO MORE EFFECTIVELY GO AFTER THESE HARMFUL AGREEMENTS OR BRAND NAME COMPANIES PAY AN ERICSSON COMPETITORS TO STAY OFF THE MARKET. WHILE THESE AGREEMENTS CAN BE ANTI COMPETITIVE UNDER CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLEX. AND THE CURRENT LEGAL FLANK FRAMEWORK IS HAD TILTED HEAVILY IN FAVOR OF THE DRUG COMPANIES. UNFORTUNATELY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT HIGHLIGHTED THIS PRACTICE CONTINUES -- BETWEEN FOUND SOME A HUNDRED AGREEMENTS THAT COULD BE PAY FOR DELAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY THE ENACTMENT OF AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR WILL CLEARLY AND EXPRESSLY GIVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ANOTHER TOOL. TO DETER THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL BILL AIMS TO DO FOR CALIFORNIANS -- I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO CLEAR UP A FEW MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BILL DOESN'T DO THIS BILL DOESN'T BAN SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE AGREE THAT PATENTS SETTLEMENTS WITHOUT PAYMENTS CAN. AND HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO CONSUMERS ARE BILL ONLY TARGET SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WHERE COME COMPETITORS ARE PAID TO DELAY ENTRY INTO THE MARKET IT IS THIS PAYMENT TO COMPETITORS THAT COURTS HAVE ALREADY SAID IT IS UNLAWFUL. THIS BILL DOESN'T EXPAND A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS -- HAVE HAD THE SAME PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT THEY WOULD UNDER COULD EXISTING LAW UNDER THE CAR RIGHT ACT THERE'S ALSO NO STACKING OF PENALTIES FOR PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS ONLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN RECOVER PENALTIES AND THEY CAN ONLY DO SO ONCE. FINALLY THIS BILL DOESN'T START SPECIAL GENERIC COMING TO MARKET THE AIM OF THE BILL. IS TO GET GENERICS TO MARKET FASTER BY PREVENTING POLICE OF AGREEMENTS TO DELAY THEIR ENTRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT YES. GOOD AFTERNOON BLANCA CASTRO. GOOD AFTERNOON SHOULD. MADAM CHAIR JACKSON VICE CHAIR BERGESEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON BEHALF OF A A RP CALIFORNIA AND THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS. WE ASK THAT YOU TAKE A BOLD STEP TODAY AND ARE YOU LEAD OUR NATION BY VOTING YES ON AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AND STOP PAY FOR DELAY. DEALS THAT ENABLE BRAND NAME MANUFACTURERS IF YOU HER TO KEEP PRICES ARTIFICIALLY HIGH. PRICE IS A GENERIC DRUGS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BRAND THEN BRAND DRUGS SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE ASKED OUR MEMBERS TO SHARE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUG STORIES AND I'D LIKE TO PUT A FACE ON A COUPLE OF THE STORIES. FROM NO WELL FROM SAN DIEGO AS SHE SHARED THE GENERIC FOR BLOB PLAVSIC'S COST ME ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FOR THREE MONTHS SUPPLY. BUT MY CARDIOLOGISTS PUT ME ON SIROTA. AND THAT COSTS JUMPED TO OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOR A THREE MONTH PRESCRIPTION. WHICH WILL PUT ME IN THE WHOLE BY JUNE. MYRTLE FROM PASO ROBLES POSSO ROBERT SHARED. I'M EIGHTY YEARS OLD I'M A WIDOW LIVING ON TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE IN A FIB. I HAVE TO TAKE SIROTA POSSIBLY DIE FROM A STROKE OR HEART ATTACK. THIS DRUG HAS CAUSED ME TO DO WITHOUT GROCERIES PLEASE HELP. IT IS BECAUSE OF STORIES LIKE THIS WHICH WE'VE HEARD FAR TOO LONG THAT A A RP CONTINUES TO SUPPORT. AND I'D LIKE TO CLOSE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE OUR FOUNDER DR COOPER'S SANDERS WAS IN FRONT OF THE U. S. SENATE JUDICIARY. ON THE ANTI TRUST. ACT AGAINST THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID WE SUBSCRIBE TO THE CONCEPT THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATION SHOULD BE KEPT AT A MINIMUM. ON THE OTHER HAND A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE IS OCCASIONALLY COMPELLED BY THE CRIES OF DISTRESS CITIZENS TO COME TO THE PROTECTION. THE LEGISLATIVE MEANS. SO AT THIS TIME WE ASK YOU TO MOVE PASSAGE IS TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS LET'S AN ACT TO PROTECT PEOPLE PEOPLE LIKE YOUR PARENTS. CHILDREN WITH DIABETES AND ONE DAY MAYBE EVEN YOURSELVES. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU ON BEHALF FAVOR A A RP TO SUPPORT EIGHT EIGHT ABA TWENTY FOUR ABOUT I THANK YOU OTHER SINCE SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT TWENTY FIVE PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON ESPN PELLET ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. I TIM VALDERRAMA WITH THE WHITEMAN GROUP ON BEHALF OF NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA AND BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

BRANDON MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. NO I BOTTOM -- CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. ARE COVERED WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IN SUPPORT ALRIGHT LET'S INVITE THE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD JUSTICE AB. EIGHT TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. GO AHEAD PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS F THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR SUCH A LONG DAY MY NAME IS JEFF FRANCE SIR I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL. OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINES. A. M. REPRESENTS THE DEVELOPERS OF GENERIC AND BIOSIMILAR MEDICINES IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH CUMULATIVELY HAVE SAVE TAXPAYERS OVER ONE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS OVER THE PAST DECADE. OUR COMPANY SAVED CALIFORNIANS OVER TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR ALONE AND MUCH OF THAT SAVINGS IS DUE TO PATENT LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD LIMIT. I'D LIKE TO MAKE THREE POINTS TO TODAY IN MY TESTIMONY. FIRST UNLESS IT IS AMENDED THE BILL YOU ARE CONSIDERING TODAY WILL DELAY THE ENTRY OF MORE AFFORDABLE GENERICS AND BY A SIMILAR. AND LEAD TO HIGHER PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING MY CALIFORNIANS AND LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY. IN ORDER TO DELIVER GENERIC MEDICINES TO PATIENTS ARE COMPANIES MUST EITHER WAIT FOR DOZENS OF BRAND NAME DRUG PATENTS TO EXPIRE. WHAT CHALLENGE ONES THAT DO NOT SEEM TO BE VALID? THE PATENT SYSTEM ALLOWS A BRAND NAME DRUG COMPANY TO GAIN LITERALLY DOZENS OF MONOPOLY PERIODS FOR SEEMINGLY TRIVIAL FEATURES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. FOR EXAMPLE THE MANUFACTURE OF THE DRUG YOU MERA HAS AMASSED ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PATENTS THAT WITHOUT LITIGATION OR SETTLEMENT HAVE ALLOWED ITS MANUFACTURE TO GAIN A MONOPOLY POSITION FROM. TWO THOUSAND TWO ALL THE WAY. TO TWENTY THIRTY FOUR A SETTLEMENT OF PATENT LITIGATION THAT COULD BE ILLEGAL UNDER THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW BY A SIMILAR VERSIONS OF HUMAN ERROR AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE INSTEAD OF TWENTY THIRTY FOUR AND THIS IS NO TRIVIAL MATTER. FOR A DRUG THAT TAKES IN MORE REVENUE THAN ALL THE NFL TEAMS COMBINED. AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR PRESUMES THAT MOST OF THE PRO PATIENT PRO COMPETITIVE PATENT LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS WOULD BE ILLEGAL. BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THEM INVOLVE SOME TYPE OF EXCHANGE OF VALUE TO THE GENERIC OR BIOSIMILAR DEVELOPER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET TO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS. HIM STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED PROVISION THE BILL CHANGES THE STANDARD BY WHICH YOU NEED TO PROVE ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR -- UNDER A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T OBJECT TO CHANGING THE STANDARD FOR GOVERNMENTAL PROSECUTIONS BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WE OBJECT TO CHANGING THE STANDARD FOR THIRD PARTY PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS. CURRENT LAW UNDER ON THE CASES IN RECENT FOR A ONE INTO OR CHOIR FOUR ELEMENTS IN ORDER -- TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE THEM A AN ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR LAWSUIT THAT THERE MUST BE A LIMIT ON SETTLING THE GENERIC CHANT CHALLENGERS ENTRY INTO THE MARKET. TO YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM SOMETHING AND THREE THAT PAYMENT NEEDS -- TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT ANY DELAY IN THE MARKET ENTRY WOULD PROVIDED AND THEN FOR THE IT ALSO HAS TO EXCEED THE REMAINING LITIGATION COSTS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REDUCE THOSE FOUR ELEMENTS DOWN. TO TWO ONE ON THAT THE GENERIC -- MANUFACTURE RECEIVED ANYTHING OF VALUE AND TWO THAT THEY AGREE TO LIMIT OR FOR GO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT MARKETING OR SALES OF THAT -- PRODUCT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT DRAMATIC REDUCTION WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS -- TO BRING AND SUCCEED IN THESE LAWSUITS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT -- WOULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY UNJUSTIFIED LITIGATION WE DON'T TRUST THE THIRD PARTY PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS AS MUCH AS WE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR THAT REASON. WE OPPOSE THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU DID NOT GET YOUR OPPOSITION IN IN A TIMELY FASHION WE WERE SENT A LETTER IN ON JUNE EIGHTEENTH YOUR ALL RIGHT. CURRENTLY WE DIDN'T RECEIVE IT THANK YOU OVERREACH NONE OF THAT THAT'S WHY I HAD A CONSISTENT POSITION THROUGHOUT OKAY I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF THERE WAS A REASON WHY IT WAS LATE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE JUST MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN IT IT HAPPENED SOME. OKAY. NO NO THAT'S FINE NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE -- ALL RIGHT OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF CAN STEP FORWARD PLEASE REALISTIC ON BEHALF OF FARM -- WE'RE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF BIO COM WE TO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BRING IN THE BILL BACK TO THE DYESS IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS -- AGAIN MY MY CONCERN THAT DO YOU TRUST THE AG MORE THAN OTHER LAWYERS BUT THAT. INDICATES YOU DON'T REALLY TRUST THE COURTS. BAD LAWSUIT TO BAD LAWSUIT WHETHER IT'S BROUGHT BY IN A G. OR PRIVATE PRACTITIONER AND IN FACT. IF YOU'RE PRIVATE ATTORNEY AND YOU'RE WORKING ON THESE CASES YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING IT ON A CONTINGENCY. AND IT'S YOUR MONEY THAT YOU LOSE IF YOU DON'T WIN SO AGAIN WE JUST HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT AT PRIVATE THE RIGHTS OF ACTIONS -- I LOOK AT IT IS A WAY SO THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T END UP HAVING TO FOOT THE BILL. TO PROSECUTE THE LEGITIMATE CLAIMS WHEN. COMPANIES VIOLATE THAT THE THE LAW THAT BEING SAID -- MINOR SAY IS THIS BILL SEEKS TO CODIFY RECENT CALIFORNIA'S SUPREME COURT DECISION. THAT FINDS THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY ANTI COMPETITIVE AND I BELIEVE THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE BILL -- OTHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MARCH IS OUR MOTION. MOVE BY. THE SENATOR DRAWS SO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONN HAS FILE ITEM EIGHTEEN AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE FILE ITEM. EIGHTEEN MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE END REGULATED INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH COST LOANS OVER THE PAST DECADE THESE LOANS START AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVE INTEREST RATES FROM 1100%. TO MORE THAN 2100% FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO REPAY THESE EXPENSIVE LOANS DATA PROVIDED BY LENDERS TO THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE SHOW THAT NEARLY 40% OF THESE HIGH COST LOANS AND IN DEFAULT. IN ADDITION TO THE CUT THE CONSTANT PRESSURE FROM DEBT COLLECTORS THIS PROCESS RESULT IN DAMAGE CREDIT FOR THE CONSUMER AND CAN ALSO LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECKS BEING GARNISH THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS CLOSED. AND THEIR CARS BEING REPOSSESSED MORE THAN ONE OUT OF THREE TIMES THESE LOANS THE PEOPLE WORSE OFF THAN WHEN THEY STARTED I CANNOT THINK OF ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT PHIL SO OFTEN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING INTO. TO INTERVENE. HI COST LENDERS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL THE THE NEED TO CHARGE SUCH HIGH RATES TO MAKE UP. FOR THE CONSUMERS WHO DEFAULT HOWEVER-HIGH INTEREST RATES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THESE LOANS AND AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS UNREGULATED SPACE ARE CLEAR THESE HIGH INTEREST RATES ALLOW LENDERS TO REMAIN SUSTAINABLY PROFITABLE EVEN WHEN ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THEIR BORROWERS. ULTIMATELY DEFAULT ON THE LOAN AB FIVE THREE NINE WILL PUT A STOP TO THIS BROKEN INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT HAVE CREDIT OPTIONS IF THIS BILL PASSES IS NOT REALISTIC. THE LENDERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT OR EVEN NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL. AND LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS AN OUT LIAR WE ARE AMONG THE SMALL MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO NOT CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS THIRTY EIGHT OTHER STATES HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS SIMILAR TO OR LOWER THAN WHAT THE BILL PROPOSES. I WORK HARD TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT COULD EARN THE SUPPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LENDERS ALIKE AND EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE AS A RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE A STRONG AND BROAD COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS GROUPS SUPPORT THIS EFFORT I WILL NOW TURN MY TIME OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIM GRAYSON WHO HAS BEEN A VALUABLE PARTNER WITH ME IN THESE EFFORTS.

OR THEY JUST GIVING DEBT COLLECTORS ACCESS TO PEOPLE YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THE POLICY OBJECTIVES OF THIS BILL STRIKING GOLDILOCKS BALANCE. AND THAT THE GUARD RAILS FOR CONSUMER LOANS ABOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WORK ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. I'VE HEARD THE COUNTLESS STORIES OF ECONOMIC RUIN AND THE STORIES ARE ALWAYS FROM THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED DISADVANTAGED AND THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED OF THOUGHTFUL REGULATIONS THIS BILL.

THANK YOU SIR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS OUR GET WITH OPPORTUNE A MISSION DRIVEN CALIFORNIA LENDER WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STOREFRONT LOCATIONS AND NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE. OUR MISSION IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING RESPONSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO TRADITIONALLY SHUT OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL SYSTEM. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT SCORE OR A MISS SCORED BY THE BUREAUS 90% OF ALL THE CONSUMERS WE SERVE. LIVE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE HELPED OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ESTABLISH THEIR FIRST CREDIT SCORE. OUR EXPERIENCES SERVING THIS COMMUNITY IS THE REASON WE FEEL COMPELLED TO JOIN WITH MANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE LENDERS IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE THE FAIR CREDIT ACT COLLECTIVELY THE LENDERS IN SUPPORT OPERATE SEVERAL HUNDRED LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND SERVE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

MADAM CHAIR SENATORS I WOULD GET ON A REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION AND ALL OF ITS CONSTITUENT -- COMPANIES. WE STILL REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS -- SPLIT MY TIME WITH MR BRAND HERE. THE MAIN REASONS IS SIMPLY ACCESS TO CREDIT. AS WAS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AND BANKING COMMITTEE THERE IS A SERIOUS CONCERN REGARDING AT ACCESS TO CREDIT. WHEN YOU HAVE A RISK BASED FINANCIAL SYSTEM? AND THE INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON THAT RISK. YOU HAVE SUB PRIME BORROWERS. IT'S A RISKY POOL [inaudible] AND YOU CAP A PRODUCT AT 36%. THE PRODUCT GOES AWAY. DAD BEGS THE QUESTION WHERE DO THESE BAR WAS CO BAR WAS GO. THE NEED IS STILL THERE. THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO AN UNREGULATED MARKET. WITH NO RECOURSE FOR CONSUMERS. THAT BEGS THE QUESTION IS THAT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS [inaudible] SO. IN RESPONSE THE ASSOCIATION HAS CONSISTENTLY OFFERED TO WORK WITH MS Là MON. MR GRAYSON. YOU KNOW IN CRAFTING A REASONABLE. WAY TO CAP THIS [inaudible] THE BILL. NOT 36% BUT SOME WAY TO CAPTURE THE RISK SOME WAY TO GET -- TO ALLOW US TO MAKE A PROFIT. AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE CREDIT THAT THEY NEED. TO NO AVAIL SECONDLY. TRUE THE LENDERS ON THE OTHER SIDE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK THEY'RE CALLED ANCILLARY PRODUCTS IN OTHER WAYS OF RECOUPING THEIR LOSS. IS THAT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS. IT'S IN I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S NOT DISCLOSED. AND IT'S ADDITIONAL FEES ON TOP OF A COSTLY LOAN THAT'S ALREADY TAKEN OUT BY CONSUMERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHANGES WITNESS PACER. HI MY NAME IS EDGAR BRAND. REGIONAL MANAGER AT CHECK INTO CASH SO. AND WE STRONGLY ON BEHALF TO CHECK INTO CASH OPPOSE THE BILL AB -- FIVE THIRTY NINE TO BE CLEAR LIKE. WE WERE STATE NOW IS. THE BILL NOT HELP CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WHO STRUGGLE BECAUSE OF ONE REASON OR ANOTHER YOU KNOW LUCKILY WITH ME I I OVERSEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I AM THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND TALK WITH THEM DIRECTLY. AND BY DOING THAT I'M ABLE TO SPEAK TO THEM AND MANY TIMES. ALMOST ALL THE TIME IS IS HERE THEIR STORY OF WHY THEY'RE THERE TO VISIT US AND THEN HT THEM HAVING THE ACCESS TO DO BUSINESS WITH US IN GET LOANS WITH US YOU KNOW IT WERE REGULATED. AND ONE THING THAT I'M VERY -- PROUD OF THAT I CAN SAY IS BEING IN THE INDUSTRY AND WORKING WITH THEM IS THAT WE'RE VERY TRANSPARENT WITH. OUR WITH OUR LOAN THE RATES THAT WE CHARGE AND WE EXPLAIN THE LOAN TO THEM -- BUT NOT A CUSTOMER CAN WALK INTO OUR OFFICE -- WE EXPLAIN TO THEM THIRTY THE LOAN WE CAN THE RATES OF THEIR PAYMENTS HOW THE LOAN WORKS. AND THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE LOAN WE HAVE DIFFERENT LOAN PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER AND FOR EVERY LOAN THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE FEE SCHEDULES TO SHOW WHAT. HOW THE LOAN WORKS WE SIT WITH THEM AT THE COUNTER THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE TRANSPARENTLY THE FEES BECAUSE HOW THE LAW WORKS THERE TOTAL PAYMENTS? AND THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE LOAN SO. YEAH CAPPING THAT 36% LIKE WE WERE SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE THOSE THERE THEY DON'T COVER OTHER HIDDEN COSTS THAT THEY HAVE ON THERE. AND WITH OUR PRODUCT IS THEY GET THE THE FULL RUNDOWN OF THE LOAN AT IN WE'VE HAD VISITORS COME TO VISIT US PRIOR AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THEM THAT. ON HOW ARE LOANS WORK SO BASED ON THE THIS IS SO SORRY ABOUT THAT I THINK A COUPLE NOTES HERE THAT I JUST WANT TO GO OVER IS THAT. WHAT'S GOING TO BE WORSE THAN A HIGH INTEREST LOAN IS. FAR CONSUMER IS BEING CUT OFF FROM A LOAN THAT IS REGULATED SITE I WANTED TO SPEAK MORE ON PERSONALLY WITH. HAVING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE IN THIS LOAN AND AND THE FEEDBACK WE GET FROM THEM AND THIS ONE THING I WANT TO ADD SO.

AND JR MEMBERS LAST WITNESS NOT LEAST BALD LEAD TOLD HIM BEHALF OF AXIS FINANCIAL IN OPPOSITION. WELL YOU HOPE YOU'RE NOT LET NOT LEAST AT SIX THAT'S THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS -- ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR DRAWS SO -- VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL -- HERE AS WELL AS IN IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE. AND I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OPEN MY EYES BECAUSE IT WAS QUITE SHOCKING WAS TO SEE SOME OF THE SAMPLE. AGREEMENTS OR THE NAMES HAD BEEN CROSSED OUT. AND TO SEE THAT THE ORIGINAL LOAN WAS I THINK SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE TOTAL LOAN TO BE PAID BACK WITH TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. JUST BLEW ME AWAY JUST. IT'S LIKE REALLY POOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE. PAIN BACK ALONE. LIKE THAT OF THAT SIZE. HOW DO WE HELP POOR PEOPLE BY DOING THAT BY MAKING MAKING THEM POOR? AND OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO GO WHERE ALSO THEY GO THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE DESPERATE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN HAVE RULES. THAT HELP THEM TO GET WHAT THEY NEED AND STILL BE SOMEWHAT FAIR. SO -- I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU. OF OUR PROVIDING THE SERVICE BUT IT'S OUR JOB IS GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE FAIR RULES. FOR ALL SERVICES -- FOR CONSUMERS -- AND THAT'S WHAT. THAT'S WHAT I'M ALL ABOUT IN TERMS OF OF DOING THIS AND IF THERE ARE. BUSINESSES THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. AND DO THIS AT A MUCH MORE REDUCE THAN HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED THREE UNDER PERCENT INTEREST. THAT I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT SO. I AM VERY PROUDLY -- IN SUPPORT THANK IN AN ARE THAT'S A MOTION. ALL RIGHT OF CENTER Y. KOWSKI. HELLO THE CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA SAID SIR RATE OF USE THREE OR HAS LANGUAGE ABOUT THERE SHALL BE NO USURY RATES. CHARGED ON LOANS. IN WHEN WE ALLOW ONE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- ALLOWED THE BANKING COMMUNITY TO IMPLODE OR TO DE REGULATE AND THEY GOT INTO ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES WE'VE SEEN CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN. BURIED UNDER THIS PROVISION WHEN I WAS. COMING TO MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR UMBERG THAT -- GE CAPITAL USED TO BE IN FIRE SIDE ABOUT THRIFT USED TO BE IN THIS AREA WHEN I FIRST STARTED PRACTICING BANKRUPTCY LAW. AND WE WOULD GET IN THEIR FACE AT A 15% INTEREST RATE THAT THEY WERE CHARGING PEOPLE THAT WAS NOT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN NINETIES. AND WE HAVE TOTALLY LOST TRACK OF THAT [inaudible] I 36% IS NOT A GOOD DEAL SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR PEOPLE IN THE FACE AND SAY DO NOT BORROW ANY MONEY. NOBODY LIKES TO DELIVER DEBT I DO THAT FOR A LIVING CITIZENS OKAY FOR ME OUR DATA FOR A LIVING NOW I DO THAT. I WOULD LOOK. I'M WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. BUT I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE I GUESS I'M DOING WHAT HISTORY LESSONS THIS WEEK IS THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW 36% WHEN I START PRACTICING LAW WAS OUTRAGEOUS YOU COULD PROBABLY. YOU COULD PROBABLY GO IN AND JUST TERMINATE. GET IT DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN OUR MODERN DAY -- BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETIMES WE NEED TO REFLECT ON WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT THIRTY SIX I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT BUT I'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN IN. THIS GAME FOR AWHILE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING SO I'D. SORRY DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I DON'T EXPECT I I GUESS DIG. I COULD ASK YOU WHAT THE USE RE RATE IS BUT I GUESS BY DEFAULT COULD BE 36% -- UNDER UNDER THIS SOMEBODY'S GONNA MAKE THAT CONNECTION BUT WITH THAT -- MOVE THE BILL. ACTUALLY SENATOR RAZA BEAT YOU TO IT -- BUT I WANT TO A IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS ARE. I AGREE A THE THE NOTION OF 36% IS JUST MIND BOGGLING AND YET THAT IS A COMPROMISE THE MIND BOGGLING LEE UNCONSCIONABLE I TRIED TO DO THIS LEGISLATION TWENTY YEARS AGO SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT YOU'VE MOVED A LOT FARTHER THAN I WAS ABLE TO DO WITH THE PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY. BEING INCREDIBLY POWERFUL BUT I THINK AS YOU SEE HOW THIS SIMPLY BERRIES PEOPLE. THEY NEED TO BORROW MONEY FOR ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND THEY NEVER GET OUT OF THE WHOLE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL TRY TO DO AND WITH THAT -- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU HAVE ALL HIT MANY POINTS -- THAT RELATE TO THIS BILL IN THE HISTORY OF THIS BILL -- AND TO OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY SAID THAT THESE RICH LOANS AND PRODUCTS WERE UNCONSCIONABLE AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT RATE WAS AND SO THEY KIND OF LOOK TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT RIGHT RATE IS AND WHERE WE GOT THAT RAID IS -- FROM A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE IT'S BEEN TESTED -- IN IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE OTHER STATES WITH THAT RATE SECONDLY AT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT. ALLOWS FOR ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ONCE THEY DISCLOSE ARE ACTIVE MEMBERS TO RECEIVE THAT RATE AND SO WE LOOKED AT WHERE WE WOULD BE THIS IS A COMPROMISE IT IS NOT A PERFECT BILL -- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT 36% IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE 100% INTEREST RATE THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING -- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED -- AND AS SEEN IN THE ANALYSIS THAT AT 36% WE STILL HAVE. COMPANIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE THAT ARE OFFERING TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CREDIT. TWO BILLION WORTH OF CREDIT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT -- IS NOT A REALISTIC IDEA ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE IS MOVING FORWARD NEW AND CREATIVE IDEAS I'M A MEMBER OF THE SENATE HAS. IT IS WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS TO OFFER DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT ARE IN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS AND THAT BILL IS MOVING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE SO WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT IN THE END TOO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE FAILING AND WITH THAT -- I WON I THINK THE THE CO AUTHORS ON THE COMMITTEE AS CENTER CASKEY AND SENATOR -- THE LAST SO ON AND TO THE COMMITTEE I HAVE FOR ALL THEIR WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THERE IS A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE. MA'AM SECTOR CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHTEEN A. B. FIVE THREE NINE JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS DO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ BUNDLES I'D JONES MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN UMBERG. NUMBER I Y. CASKEY. I KELSEY I I WILL TOO WE'RE GONNA DO ONE MORE BILL AND THEN TAKE ABOUT A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES [inaudible] BREAK -- I'M SORRY SIX TWO ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN. UP ONE SECOND IF WE COULD YOU WAIT. I HAVE ONE MORE. BETTER WE'LL. MY APOLOGIES I THINK WILL PROBABLY TAKE A SHE A SHORT BREAK AROUND SIX THIRTY SO WE'LL LET THAT WILL KEEP GOING -- WE HAVE A LITTLE THE FOOD COMING FOR SOME OF THOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SO THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BRAIN POWER LEFT GOING INTO THE EVENING -- BUT RIGHT NOW LET'S GO AHEAD WITH THIS ITEM THANK YOUAND MADAM CHAIR ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE A CHARITY TO USE INTERNATIONAL VALUES. WHEN REPORTING AND NON CASH DONATIONS THAT IS LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM BEING USED IN THE UNITED STATES VALUING? A NON CASH DONATION AT U. S. PRICES WHEN IT CANNOT BE USED IN THE U. S. AND MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OVER EVALUATION. PHARMACEUTICAL DONATIONS TO CHARITIES ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO OVER EVALUATION BECAUSE THEIR VALUE ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET CAN BE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED TO THEIR MARKET VALUE IN THE US. AS A RESULT THE PUBLIC IS LED TO BELIEVE THE CHARITIES MORE SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENT AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE ONLY APPLIES IN THE NARROW CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN A NON CASH DONATION IS LEGALLY RESTRICTED BY THE DONOR. FOR USE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT ALL DONORS HAVE A COMPLETE AND FAIR PICTURE. OF A CHARITIES OF A CHARITIES GOOD WORK WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TIENEN YVONNE YES AND ANTHONY LOU WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. VERY MUCH OF A TWO MINUTE TEACHER AT THE MOST. I ANTHONY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER THE MON FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION. AND OUR STAFF FOR HELPING FACILITATE MANY ROUNDS OF DISCUSSION WITH THE OPPONENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BILL. AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPONENT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS -- THEY ABOUT. OVER VALUATION PROBLEM WHICH I THINK MANY AGREE IS A REAL ISSUE THAT DESERVES ATTENTION. WHEN I TURN MY TIME OVER -- WELL ACTUALLY LOOMING WHEN ONE MORE SENTENCE HERE TO OUR OFFICE TAKES THE POSITION THAT THE DONOR RESTRICTIONS ARE LEGALLY BINDING AND SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. BUT CHARITIES THAT ACCEPT NON CASH DONATIONS. THE CURRENTLY BOTH FAST BE. AN A. I. C. P. A. ALLOW CHARITIES TO IGNORE DONOR RESTRICTIONS. AND INSTEAD VALUE GIFT IN KIND CONTRIBUTIONS USING THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE VALUE OF THE PRINCIPAL MARKET OF THE NINE CASH DONATIONS. SO AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE IS A BILL THAT WILL CLOSE THE GAP THAT WAS CREATED BY THE ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY -- CODIFY COMMON LAW PRINCE WHAT THE DONOR RESTRICTIONS ARE BINDING AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO TANYA BUNIONS. THE OJ. YES GOOD EVENING THANK YOU THANK YOU BOB MY NAME IS TINY OF IDEAS AND ON THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE CHARITABLE TRUST SECTION. MY SECTION HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS AUDITS AND WE'VE ALSO FILED SEVERAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST CHARITIES THAT HAVE ABUSED GIFT IN KIND REPORTING. ON THEY ARE USING U. S. PRICE SAYS TO VALUE DONATIONS THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT CANNOT BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE PHARMACEUTICAL DONATIONS ARE GOING TO FOREIGN NATIONS AND YET THE CHARITIES ARE USINGU. S. PRICES TO VALUE THOSE DONATIONS AND IT HAS RESULTED IN RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED. BOTH AS REVENUE AND IS PROGRAM EXPENSES ONE EXAMPLE WAS A D. WARMING PALE THAT WAS VALUED AT AS OPPOSED TO INTERNATIONAL PRICES. UNFORTUNATELY CHARITIES ARE TYPICALLY RATED BY TWO STANDARDS ONE IS THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION BASED ON ITS REVENUE IT'S TOTAL REVENUE AND THE OTHER IS ITS PROGRAM EFFICIENCY WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS TOTAL REVENUE. USED TO SUPPORT ITS CHERNOBYL PROGRAM AS OPPOSED TO ITS ADMINISTRATIVE OR FUND RAISING -- ARE LAWSUIT AGAINST NATIONAL CANCER COALITION DEMONSTRATES HOW EFFECTIVE ABUSING GIFT IN KIND DONATIONS USING US PRICES CAN ARTIFICIALLY BUMP UP A CHARITIES REVENUE. THE NATIONAL CANCER COALITION WAS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS REVENUE IN TWO YEARS FROM TWELVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION IN REVENUE JUST BY USING GIFT IN KIND DONATION THAT CONSISTED OF PHARMACEUTICAL -- DONATIONS USING US PRICES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL DONATIONS MADE UP U. S. PRICES THE NATIONAL CANCER COALITION WAS ABLE TO TELL DONORS. THAT 97% OF ITS REVENUE WAS SUPPORTING ITS CHARITABLE PROGRAM WAS ONLY HALF A PERCENT WAS SUPPORTING ITS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND LESS THAN 2% WAS -- SUPPORTING ITS FUNDRAISING EXPENSES AT THE USED INTERNATIONAL PRICES THEIR REVENUE AND THE PROGRAM EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED 260% THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITH DECISION SUPPORT. ARE THESE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO WITH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASED TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS -- SHOES THIS BILL HAS WAS INTRODUCED WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THE AUTHOR. THEY UNDERSTAND OUR PRINCIPAL -- CONCERNED FRANK THEIR ONLY CONCERN HAS TO DO WITH A STATUTORY STATE ONLY CHANGE TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE THE LIFEBLOOD. OF THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION IN TERMS OF BOTH -- AUDITS AND TAX RETURNS AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THIS WILL ONLY CHANGE IT. IN CALIFORNIA WE DO UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FACE SOME VERY EGREGIOUS SITUATIONS -- THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT FRANKLY WE BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS IT IS THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS FOR CHANGING GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ARE FROM -- FAST BE AND THE GAS BE AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROCESS THE TREE GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD THE CHANCE TO TALK TO THESE FOLKS. WE ARE HOPING THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE BETTER APPROACH IS TO GIVE THOSE ENTITIES TIME TO MAKE THIS CHANGE I'M NOT SURE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS FULL CONFIDENCE YET. THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN IN AN EXPEDITIOUS FASHION BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SHOULD BE HELD -- THIS YEAR AND GIVE THAT OPPORTUNITY A CHANCE TO UNFOLD THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF GEN BRENNER VICE PRESIDENT FINANCE WITH WORLD VISION IN THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPA'S NOT FOR PROFIT EXPERT PANEL. AT WORLD VISION WE SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERVALUATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND WORKED CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE MOANS OFFICE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER THE AMENDED BILL STILL HAS TOO MANY UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE LEADERS OF THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION CONFIRM THE BILL CONFLICTS WITH GAP. THE AUTHOR WISELY RECOGNIZE THIS CONFLICT BY EXEMPTING US GRANTS HOWEVER CONFLICTS REMAIN FOR UNITED NATIONS GRANTS AND OTHER GOODS. THE BILL FORCES CHARITIES TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FOLLOWING GAP OR CALIFORNIA LAW OR HAVING TWO SETS OF BOOKS. BOTH ARE UNTENABLE CHOICES WHICH HAVE NO PRECEDENT IN ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. THEBILL ADD SUBSTANTIAL COSTS COMPLEXITY AND CONFUSION FOR CHARITIES AND OUR DONORS BY REQUIRING CHARITIES TO DEVELOP A SECOND SET OF UNIQUE CALIFORNIA VALUES FOR GIFT IN KIND. A SECOND SET OF BOOKS OBTAIN A SECOND AUDIT. TAX RETURN AND FUNDRAISE WITH TWO SETS OF DONOR APPEALS. THE RESULTING PUBLIC CONFUSION IS ON REASONABLE. THE BILL ALSO FAILS TO ADDRESS OVER VALUATION OF PHARMACEUTICALS DISTRIBUTED DOMESTICALLY WELL SOME GOODS MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE IN VALUE INTERNATIONALLY. WE RESPECTFULLY A PROPOSED TO OPTIONS. THE WAY THE BILL AND COLLABORATE WITH THE FAST BE WHO SETS THE STANDARDS TO PROVIDE A NATIONAL SOLUTION OR SECOND WE WOULD BE WILLING TO WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION IF THE BILL WERE AMENDED TO ALIGN WITH GAP. WHAT PROVIDING ENHANCED GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS THE VALUATION CONCERNS? WE INVITE A SOLUTION WHICH PROMOTES GREATER COLLABORATION UP HOLD COMMON NATIONAL STANDARDS AND ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE LET SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE RESPECTFULLY WE ARE OPPOSING LESS AMENDED.

RESTRICTED USE OF THEIR NON CASH CONTRIBUTIONS THERE OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF IT. CORRECT IT'S JUST IT'S VERY FOCUSED VERY NARROW TO RESTRICTED [inaudible] DRUGS [inaudible] OKAY. SOME OF THE BILL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO IN YOUR CLOTHES ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT THE CPA'S HAVE THAT. BECAUSE FOR CALIFORNIAN USING DIFFERENT RULES THAT CREATES A PROBLEM RIGHT SO -- THE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE NATIONAL TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING. FOR TEN MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED AND IN -- IN THAT PROCESS WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ARISE NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN OTHER PLACES SO. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE MOVE FORWARD -- OTHERS WILL SEE WHAT CALIFORNIA IS DOING WE DON'T THINK BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CASES BEING INVESTIGATED AND ALSO FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN FOUND I TOO HAVE BEEN CHANGING THIS NUMBERS THAT WAITING HELPS US WE CAN BE WAITING ANOTHER TEN YEARS -- AND IN THE MEANTIME WE DO THINK THAT AS IS THE CASE CALIFORNIA TENDS TO BE A BIG PORTION OF THE COUNTRY'S MARKET SHARE SO I'M WE WILL MOVE FORWARD THIS IS NOT THE ONLY TIME AND ONLY PLACE -- WHERE CALIFORNIA DOES THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT?

POINTS WERE TELL YOU SHE CAN RANGE FROM SUBTLE WORKPLACE INTIMIDATION TO OUTRIGHT THREATS SUCH AS THREATENING DEPORTATION. RETALIATION IS NOT ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. IN FACT IT IS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RETALIATION COMPLAINT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER REPORTED DOUBLING OF THE NUMBER RETALIATION PLANS BASED ON SEX RACE OR ETHNICITY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR.

THE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR CHRISTOPHER SENSES WHICH OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WERE PROUD TO BE A SPONSOR OF IT BEFORE -- THREE FOR THE MANY YEARS OF OUR EXPERIENCE IN ORGANIZING AND EDUCATING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WE HAVE FOUND THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE VICTIMS OF CRIMES FRAUD. WELL AS I HAD THEIR WORKERS RIGHTS VIOLATED IT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM A YEAR TO TWO YEARS FOR THEM TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH JUST A GREEN. TO COME FORWARD TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO FOLLOW REPORT OF ANY KIND THESE ARE DIFFICULT STEPS FOR IMMIGRANTS BECAUSE MANY TIMES INDIVIDUAL HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEM. HAS THE VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION OUT OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES ESPECIALLY IN THE SETTING OF AN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE WHICH MANY OF THEM FARE WOULD BE USED TO READ TO BE RETALIATED AGAINST THEM OR THEIR LOVED ONES. WE ALSO KNOW AS THAT SOME COMPANIES ARE WILLING TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO THIS INFORMATION TO INTIMIDATE WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A GROUP OF IMMIGRANT WORKERS TRAVELED HERE TO THE STATE CAPITOL. TO SPEAK AT ASSEMBLY LABOR INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT WORKER PROTECTIONS FOR IMMIGRANTS THEY WERE FALL FROM THEIR HOMES TO THE STATE CAPITOL. TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM BY BY LAWYERS REPRESENTING THE EMPLOYER THE MARK AS BROTHERS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BY EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION UNDOCUMENTED MENTOR WORKERS WILL BRING CERTAIN CLAIMS FORWARD TO THE LABOR COMMISSION. WILL BE ALLOWED TO FILE THE UV SO WHICH PROVIDES PROTECTION FROM DEPORTATION AND A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP. IF THEY FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE AGENCY AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE A VICTIM.

BUT I'M SURE SENATORS BENEFIT COME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO A BEFORE. THREE WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS NO OBJECTION TO EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO INCREASED LITIGATION IN THE COURTS. THE ONE WAY ATTORNEY'S FEES PROVISION WILL MEAN THAT MORE MORE THESE CASES WILL BE FILED IN THE COURTS RATHER THAN THE DEAL AS HE PROCESS WHICH RAISES LITIGATION COSTS FOR ALL SIDES. WE BELIEVE THE DEALS HE PROCESS IS STILL IN EFFECT ONE AND SHOULD NOT BE UNDERMINED BY LEGISLATION THAT WILL MOTIVATE THESE CLAIMS TO BE FILED IN CIVIL COURT INSTEAD. AND IT JUST A COUPLE MORE SPECIFICS FROM THE SAME TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RETALIATION REPORT THAT THE AUTHOR CITED -- WHICH AGAIN THE DLC PROCESS IS NOT A PERFECT PROCESS BUT WE THINK THERE HAVE BEEN IMPROVEMENTS -- IN 200-017-2500 RETALIATION CASES WERE OPENED. THE DEAL IS THE ALSO CLOSE. THE DEAL IS THE REPORT CONCLUDED THERE WERE ONLY FOUR CASES REMAINING UNASSIGNED AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WHEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES. REMAIN UNASSIGNED -- THERE'S BEEN OTHER RECENT CHANGES TO THE RETALIATION PROCESS A NUMBER HERTZBERG HAD SB THREE OH SIX WHICH STREAMLINED A LOT OF THE PROCESS AND HAS SOME CLEAN UP LEGISLATION THIS YEAR AS WELL. THERE BEEN BUDGET -- AUGMENTATIONS FOR THE RETALIATION UNIT SO WE BELIEVE THE RETALIATES THE DEAL WAS HE RETALIATION PROCESS IS EFFECTIVE AND IF ANYTHING HAS SHOWN IMPROVEMENT. IN RECENT YEARS AND AGAIN FOR THESE REASONS WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A BEFORE THREE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE HIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS ONE IS WITH THE EXTENSION OF THAT. TIME -- TO BRING A CLAIM FROM SIX MONTHS TO THREE YEARS THAT THE SIX TIMES EXTENSION AND SECOND WITH A ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES PROVISIONS FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST BE. RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU NOT SURPRISED -- OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES SERVICE HERE. NOT. NOT AT NOT EVER BUT THANK YOU COULD TRY. NO YOU KNOW I THINK I BELIEVE IN OUR JUDICIAL PROCESS I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO REDRESS THEIR GRIEVANCES IT'S SORT OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET OVER -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER WHAT DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF WE DO LET'S LET'S. LET THE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARCHING IN HEARING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KING THERE'S NO OF AMENDMENTS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE BUT THERE'S A SUGGESTION ON PAGE FIVE THE TALKS ABOUT. THIS TWO WAY ONE WAY -- LITIGATION IN THEN A SUGGESTION ABOUT. IF IT'S WOEFULLY OR EARLY MERITLESS -- CASE. THIS IS THE AUTHOR HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT -- GROUP OF THAT FITS CURRENTLY DROPPED IS APPROPRIATE. ON THE THAT LANGUAGE IS STANDARD IN EVERY SINGLE CIVIL RIGHTS AND EMPLOYMENT LAW. STATUTE THAT FOR INTO THE SINK THE ONE WAY YEAH THAT THAT THAT THE THE ONE WAY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS WERE A TWO WAY AND THIS BODY AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A LAW. TO MAKE TO EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE A ONE WAY STATUTE AND LESS IT'S FRIVOLOUS SURBITON BAD FAITH IF YOU BRING A MERITLESS CLAIM OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT IF IT'S NOT MERYL WITH MERIT LISTED WOULD CHILL -- ALL LAWSUIT BECAUSE AT THAT TIME BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN NOBODY WAS APPEALING THOSE CASES. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE LANGUAGE IN ON PAGE FIVE IS SANDERS STATEMENT OF WHAT THE CURRENT LAW IS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT SAYING MAKING IT A TWO WAY TO ONE WAY BUT IF IT'S? WHAT? APPARENTLY FRIVOLOUS THAT THERE WOULD BE RECOVERY FOR THE DEFENDANTS RIGHT EXACTLY AND THAT'S STANDARD IN EVERY CIVIL RIGHTS AND EMPLOYMENT RIGHT STATURE EVEN IN A WRESTLE LAW. OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK THIS IS A THIS IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT.

HE DOES HAVE A WE'RE GONNA LET HER SHE NEEDS GO OUR RECESS HAS ENDED AND WE'RE GOING. TO SKIP HERE WITH THE THE AGREEMENT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE THE LAST BILL -- TONIGHT FILE ITEM SIXTY SIX AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT UP. RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE YOUR NEED TO GET BACK TO YOUR LITTLE. ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. YOU GUYS ARE HEROES HERE IN THIS MARATHON SESSION. I WANT TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT DUE TO RECENT COURT DECISION I WILL AMEND THE LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIREMENT OUT OF MY BILL AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS INJURED BY PRODUCTS ARE APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED. AB SEVENTY NINETY MERS PENDING EUROPEAN UNION REGULATIONS BY ENSURING THAT OUR MOST BASIC NOTIONS OF TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS. ARE PART OF THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF MARKET PLACES TREATMENT OF THEIR SMALL BUSINESS VENDORS. THIS BILL WILL DO THIS IN THREE WAYS FIRST THESE BILLS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE MARKETPLACES TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO BE WRITTEN IN PLAIN AN INTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGE DESCRIBE THE GROUNDS FOR WHEN THE MARKET PLACE CAN KEEP A SMALL BUSINESSES MONEY PENDING RESOLUTION OF A DISPUTE. AND LAY OUT THE GROUNDWORK RULES FOR HOUSE SELLERS CAN GET PREFERENTIAL PRODUCT PLACEMENT OVER THEIR COMPETITORS AND HOW THOSE PREFERENCES WORK. SECOND THIS BILLS ABOUT FAIRNESS THIS BILL REQUIRES MARKET PLACES TO PROVIDE SELLERS FOR THE WRITTEN STATEMENT OF REASONS WHEN THE SELLER'S ACCOUNT IS SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED. THE DETAILS THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THAT DECISION. THIRD THIS BILLS ABOUT DUE PROCESS THIS BILL REQUIRES MARKET PLACES TO PROVIDE SELLERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE THEIR PROPERTY BEFORE THE MARKET PLACE DESTROYS IT. MADAM TURN SENATORS THIS BILLS ABOUT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT SELL ON EACH COMMERCE MARKETPLACES WHICH HAVE GROWN IN SIZE. AND INFLUENCE IN OUR RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE YOU COMMERCE MARKETPLACES EXERT A LOT OF CONTROL OF THE SELLERS WHO USE THEIR PLATFORM. IT SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR EXPLANATIONS IN WRITING WHEN THE MARKET PLACES ACTIONS INHIBIT A SELLER'S ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION WHEN MARKET PLACES ACT AS THE JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN ACCUSATION AGAINST THE SELLER WARRANTS THE DESTRUCTION. OF THE CELL SELLERS PROPERTY IS ONLY FAIR THAT THE SELLER BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE THE MERCHANDISE PRIOR TO DESTRUCTION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MARKET PLACES DECISIONS NOT A LEGAL. ONE IT'S BASED ON EACH REPRESENTATIVE MARKETPLACES OPAQUE INTERNAL PROCESS. WELL I AM PLEASED TO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS. CONCEPTUALLY THERE'S NO REASON WHY MARKET PLACES SHOULD BE ABLE TO HIDE THE BALL ON THESE TOPICS FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES SOLELY AFFECTED BY THEM. THIS BILL HAS A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF SUPPORT FROM BUSINESS TO LABOR AND HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IT IS CO AUTHORED BY MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND TO DATE IT HAS NOT RECEIVED A SINGLE NO VOTE. WITH ME TODAY IS MARKET PRAYER REPRESENTING THE ONLINE MARK A MARGIN SKILLED A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF SMALL SELLERS. AND AT HOWARD REPRESENTING WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A TWO MINUTE TEACHER IF YOU WOULD ADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAY OUT WITH THE ONLINE MERCHANTS GUILD. WE ARE A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS WHO SELL ON AMAZON EBAY AND OTHER ONLINE MARKETPLACES. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR IT -- BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS. OF NOT ONLY WHAT'S IN THE BILL BUT THE MARKET PLACE IN WHICH WE'RE OPERATING. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE THAT EACH OF THE ITEMS IN THE BILL ARE THERE BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL IS NOW SEEKING TO ADDRESS. IT IS NOT THEORETICAL LET ME START WITH THE THE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRE YOU KNOW A A PLANE READING OR PLAIN LANGUAGE. THE FACT IS IS THAT AMAZON -- IS IT WAS DEVELOPING INVITED PEOPLE TO BECOME THIRD PARTY SELLERS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON PROGRAM. THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE NOTICE THAT THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS WERE REQUIRED TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND NOW WHAT WE HAVE IS A TAX -- A TAX SITUATION THAT COULD BE IN A CAN TO ATTACKS -- AS SITUATION IN WHICH PEOPLE NOW ARE A LIABLE FOR BACK TAXES WHICH WILL RESULT IN BANKRUPTCY AND MANY LOSING THEIR BUSINESSES I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE OTHER TERMS IN THE BILL. DEALING WITH DISCLOSURE OF WHEN SOMEONE CAN BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED THIS IS NOT A THEORETICAL MATTER THERE ARE OFTEN TIMES WHEN THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS FIVE IN THEMSELVES SUSPENDED AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT. OF PURGATORY AND SO WE ARE ASKING FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. NOT BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT BUT SIMPLY TO ALLOW THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS TO KNOW WHAT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE THAT THEY ARE IN PLAIN ENGLISH. AND THAT THEY ARE A ENFORCED BY THEM THE ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE WE DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS AT HOWARD WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA PLEASE TO SPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I ALSO WANT TO ECHO MISTER PRAISE COMMENTS THINKING YOU'RE THE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK AND FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK. FOR IN IN IN IN SUPPORT OF THIS A HEARING ON YOUR NOW SAYS ON PAGE FIVE APTLY FRAMES -- THE PROBLEM -- THAT SPARKS THIS BILL IT'S IT'S QUOTED ARTICLE AND IT SAYS FOR SELLERS AMAZON IS A QUASI STATE ON PAGE FIVE SELLERS ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT A CASE BEING OPENED. ON AMAZON THAN AN ACTUAL CORE. AMAZON'S JUDGMENT IS SWIFTER AND LESS PREDICTABLE AND NOW THAT THE COMPANY CONTROLS NEARLY HALF OF THE ONLINE RETAIL ARKET IN THE U. S.. ITS RULINGS CAN INSTANTLY DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF YOUR BUSINESS. JOHN MEMBERS THIS BILL POSES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. SHOULD ANY MARKETPLACE COMPANY LET ALONE ONE THAT HAS 50% OF THE MARKET. LAWFULLY BE ABLE. TO FEES AND THEN DEFINITELY KEEP A SMALL BUSINESSES MONEY WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE GROUNDS FOR DOING SO. LAWFULLY BE ABLE TO TERMINATE AND POSSIBLY KILL SMALL BUSINESS WITHOUT EXPLAINING THE GROUNDS FOR DOING SO SERVE THE CHARGES MAY BE DISPUTED. LAWFULLY BE ABLE TO TAKE FOR ITSELF THE UNILATERAL RIGHT TO SEIZE AND DESTROY PRIVATE PROPERTY. BECAUSE OF ALLEGEDLY WRONGFUL CONDUCT WITHOUT EVER NOTIFYING THE POLICE. AND UNLIKE A RETAIL STORE THAT BUYS AND OWNS ITS PRODUCTS AND PLACES THEM WHEREVER IT MAY LIKE BECAUSE ITS OWN PROFIT MARGINS AT THE STATE. BE ABLE TO KEEP SECRET WHETHER AN UPON WHAT TERMS THE MARKET PLACE FAVORS ONE BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER. IT IS AN UNUSUAL COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR AND CONSUMER GROUPS. ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS RESPECTFULLY NO. YOUR ANALYSIS ON PAGE FOUR AND SOME SHARE MEMBERS -- QUOTES THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER STAN LEE. GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY [inaudible] THIS BILL. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BILL GREAT POWER COMES WITH? EXCEEDINGLY MODEST RESPONSIBILITY. TO ADHERE TO THE BARE MINIMUM. OF FAIR. BUSINESS BEHAVIOR THANK YOU ASKED.

THANK CHAIRMAN JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS CHARLES RIGHT ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL FROM AMAZON. NOW WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT FOOTPRINT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WITH OVER THIRTY NINE THOUSAND FULL TIME EMPLOYEES SUPPORTING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SELLERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AB SEVENTY NINETY HAS BEEN AMENDED SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL WAYS SINCE THAT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY WHEN IT CAME OUT OF ASSEMBLY WE DID NOT OPPOSE IT -- BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT BILL -- AT THE TIME IT -- THE THE REQUIRED US TO HAVE TRANSPARENT TERMS WITH OUR SELLERS WHICH WE STRIVE -- FOR AT ALL TIMES -- BUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL AND THESE THESE NEW AMENDMENTS WHAT HARM CONSUMERS IN THE VERY SELLERS THAT THE AUTHOR INTENDS TO PER -- PROTECT WE OPPOSE FOR FOUR REASONS FIRST AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WOULD REQUIRE STORES THAT OFFER MARKETPLACE SERVICES -- TO TO RETURN COUNTERFEIT IN ILLEGAL PRODUCTS TO BAD ACTORS ON DEMAND. WHEN AMAZON DISCOVERS GOODS IN ITS? IN ITS FOR FROM A NETWORK THAT ARE ILLEGAL WE DESTROY THEM TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WE GIVE COULD WE GIVE SELLERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. TO PROVE THAT WE HAVE NOT MADE A MISTAKE BUT IF THEY CANNOT DO SO WE DO IT WOULD DESTROY THEM THIS BILL WOULD GET BAD ACTORS A STATUTORY RIGHT. TO DEMAND THE RETURN OF THOSE GOODS SECOND AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WOULD UNDERMINE. OUR EFFORTS TO FIGHT FRAUD AND ABUSE IN OUR STORES WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY TO FIGHT FRAUD AND ABUSE AND PROTECT CONSUMERS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE US TO LAY OUT IN PROVIDE ROAD MAPS TO BAD ACTORS ON WHAT IS PROHIBITED IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO TELL THEM HOW WE DETECTED THEM. IT WOULD REQUIRE IS TO TELL THEM HOW ARE SYSTEMS OPERATE IT WOULD UNDERMINE OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT FRAUD AND CRIME IN OUR STORES. THIRD AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WOULD REQUIRE STORES THAT OFFER MARK UP FOR MARKETPLACE SERVICES. TO DIVULGE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WITHOUT IMPOSING SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS ON OUR COMPETITORS IT WOULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE HOW WE PRESENT THE PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN OUR STORE. WHICH WOULD IN TURN ENABLE BAD ACTORS TO GAME THOSE. SYSTEMS. AND AND FINALLY IF I MAY AB SEVENTY NINE IS BASED ON A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF COMPETITION IN THE RETAIL SECTOR -- RETAILS AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE IN AND LEAST CONCENTRATED BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS IN THE WORLD BOXING LAST NIGHT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE I'M KAREN MEMBERS COURTNEY JENSEN ON BEHALF OF TECH MAD WE REPRESENT EIGHTY EIGHT MEMBER COMPANY AS MANY WHO ARE WAY. MANY OF WHICH ARE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT AMAZON IS ABOUT A FISH LARGE ABROAD A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT ARE IMPACTED -- SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE DEFINITION OF MARKET PLACE IN THIS BILL INCLUDES A WHERE A MARKET PLACE SOLAR CELLS ARE OFFERS FOR SALE SERVICES OR TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY. TO BE CLEAR THE BILL ENCOMPASSES COMPANIES THAT OFFER SERVICES NOT JUST TANGIBLE PRODUCTS AND THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS AT AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS MENTIONED SEVERELY WEAKENED PROTECTIONS AGAINST COUNTERFEITS AND FRAUD ON MARKET ONLINE MARKETPLACES. AND WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A COMPANY WERE TO RETURN INVENTORY TO A SELLER WHICH MAY BE REQUIRING A MARKET PLACE TO RETURN COUNTERFEIT OR ILLEGAL GOODS TO BAD ACTORS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PRIVATE COMPANIES EVERY DAY ARE TRYING TO AND INVESTING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO COME BAK. AT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT GOODS AND AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WOULD EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM THAT WERE ACTIVELY TRYING TO SOLVE -- FINALLY AS MENTIONED THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO REVEAL TRADE SECRET -- ALGORITHM INFORMATION AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION REGARDING HOW A COMPANY MAY RANK SERVICES PRODUCTS OR OFFERS -- AND THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE PRICE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PUT INTO THIS BILL ON JUNE TWENTY EIGHT THEIR SEVERELY PROBLEMATIC ARE REQUESTING AN ELBOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE -- BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KELLY HIT WITH COMP TIA AND OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KELLY WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES SAYING NONE WILL BRING THIS BACK TO THE DYESS SENATOR Y. KOWSKI. SURE WHEN YOU. AND COVER COUNTERFEIT MATERIALS AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO TURN IT OVER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT YES YOU ARE [inaudible] SO. ONE WHO TOLD AMAZON THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY IT RATHER THAN TURN OF THE LAWN FOR SONY ASKED ME S. THEM. GOING THROUGH YOU MEN WITH A CHAIR. THANK YOU I WASN'T CLEAR WHETHER I WAS. BEING TESTED TO SEE HOW MUCH I KNEW ABOUT THE SPILLED. THE ANSWER TO THE CHAIRED PLACE THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TURN OVER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN WE FIND COUNTERFEITERS IN BAD ACTORS AND WE DO PROSECUTE -- LAW -- BAD ACTORS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNABLE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME THAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM TODAY AND IS UNDER THE UNABLE TO PROSECUTE. THE CRIMINALS WHO ARE WHO ARE USING OUR SERVICES TODAY IF WE WERE REQUIRED. TO TURN OVER EVERY COUNTERFEIT THAT WE FOUND -- THEY WOULD BE INUNDATED WITH COUNTERFEITS BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT BECAUSE THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY TURN THE COUNTERFEITS OVER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IT SAYS GIVE THEM BACK TO THE CRIMINALS. UPON DEMAND. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION FOR FRAUD OR COUNTERFEIT IN THIS BILL IT SIMPLY SAYS IF A SELLER ASKED FOR IT YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE INVENTORY BACK FULL STOP THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO MINE JUST ENGAGING ON THAT ISSUE OF THE RETURN AND CRIMINAL FRAUD ISSUES. I MEAN I THINK WITH THE CHAIR YES. AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE MY WAY TO SPEAK TO THIS AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A COMPANY THAT IS THE JURY JUDGE AND EXECUTIONER OF MAKING DECISIONS -- IT SEEMS UNFAIR TO ME TO SMALL BUSINESSES WHO. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE SAY SOMEONE PURCHASED -- A HUNDRED PAIRS OF NIKE'S FROM AN AD YOU KNOW A LOT FOOT LOCKER GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THEY SELL THEM AND SOMEONE LODGED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THAT AND THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE OR NOT FRAUDULENT THEY'RE NOT COUNTERFEIT NIKES AND THE SMALL BUSINESS PAID FOR THAT RIGHT. RIGHT NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. AMAZON HAS THE POWER TO TAKE THAT IN THAT IN THAT THAT MERCHANDISER JUST DESTROYED. AT IF THEY SO DEEM NECESSARY THAT'S IT THAT COST TO THE SMALL BUSINESS WHO HAS PUT YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO THIS. WE DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE SMALL BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE THOSE GOODS I ALSO BELIEVE IF THERE'S REAL FRAUDULENT. ACTIVITY HAPPENING -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPENS RIGHT THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FOR WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS YOU KNOW AND THEY SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS -- AND IT SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO I THINK A COMPANY TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT IS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THESE GUYS WANNA. ELIMINATE ON THAT ARE VERY BRIEFLY PLEASE THERE'S NO PROSECUTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN ANY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEY ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT I'M AWARE OF THE DELEGATES ONE PRIVATE COMPANY. THE ABILITY TO DESTROY PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. AND IF IN FACT THERE IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM. WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE THOSE LAWS. SO IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPANY WITH 50% MARKET SHARE WHERE THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE INABILITY OF REGULAR STANDARD BRAND SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE TO BE HEARD. TO BE HEARD THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD SEE TO THIS POWER TO ONE PARTICULAR COMPANIES ENOUGH WE WOULD NEVER AGREE TO DO THIS WITH THE GOVERNMENT THANK YOU. MAY RESPOND ANY NO. JUST -- IS THERE ANY OPENNESS TO TRYING TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN. THE THEIR THAT THIS SORT OF GOOD FAITH MISTAKE THAT SOMEONE ARE TALKED ABOUT AND THEN. THE KIND OF FRAUDULENT INTENT BECAUSE I WORRY I MEAN THEY THEY TALKED WITH A VOLUME CHALLENGE WITH THE QUANTITY OF SALES OCCURRING ON THIS PLATFORM.

AB NINE THIRTY ONE HAS A SUNRISE DAY OF TWENTY THIRTY GIVING LOCAL CITIES OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A DECADE TO RECRUIT AND ENCOURAGE MORE QUALIFIED WOMEN. OUT ON THEIR LOCAL POINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA MAKE UP 52% OF THE POPULATION. AND SAYS IT CITIES A FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE THEY OFTEN COMPRISING EVEN HIGHER PERCENTAGE WELL WOMEN HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES IN THE WORK FORCE. IN RECENT YEARS THEY STILL FACE INEQUITIES THAT OFTEN PREVENT THEM FROM REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE WOMEN TO THIS DAY REMAIN VASTLY UNDERREPRESENTED. UNDER REPRESENTED ON APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND ENCINITAS WERE SERVED ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHEN I GOT ON I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN. I WOULD LEFT BECAME A COUNCIL MEMBER. MY SUCCESSOR WAS A WOMAN. SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN SHE LEFT BECAME A COUNCIL MEMBER WHEN I GOT ELECTED THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND NOW IT'S AN ALL MALE BOARD. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE SHARED RECENTLY THAT WHILE SHE WAS IN. LOOKING FOR TO RUN FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD NOT BE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION OF OUR CITY. BECAUSE AS A WOMAN THE IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP POSITION WITH THE DIRE OFFICE AND THEY DIDN'T APPOINT WOMEN. THIS IS WHY THIS BILL ENJOYS SUPPORT OF THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S POLITICAL CAUCUS AND MANY OF ITS LOCAL CHAPTERS THE STATE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. AND EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES AMONG OTHER GROUPS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT THEY REALLY HELP -- FRAME THE BILL IN A WAY THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL APPROPRIATE.

TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM TO MEET OUR STATE RECYCLING GOALS SPECIFICALLY DOES WILL ALLOW FOR A BRIDGE PLAN. INDIA CASE ALMOST ISSUE ORGANIZATIONS CEASES OPERATION OR OF MAN IS DISAPPROVED. A DV TO TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER FEES AND CONTINUE RECYCLING THIS BILL REQUIRED TO TRANSFER OF TO AN EXPANDED. THE CONSUMER FEES TO THE DEPOSIT. INTO TRUSTS OR ESCROW TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM.

FOR THE CIVIL PENALTY FROM ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER DAY TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR PER DAY TO ALLOW CAL RECYCLE TO DETER FUTURE. OF VIOLATIONS IN ADDITION DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CAL RECYCLE STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES UTILIZED TO HELP BRING AND DOES PROGRAMMING INTO COMPLIANCE. DURING THE THREE ALL OF THE SEVEN YEARS SINCE TWO CREATION OF THE PROGRAM. THE CALLS HAVE EXCEEDED DESTRUCTION -- RE 5% CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.

ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE STEP FORWARD [inaudible] TO AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF INCREASING THE FINE. MADAM CHAIR RAINY POLLOCK IN BEHALF OF THE CARPET AND RUG INSTITUTE WHICH IS ASSOCIATION MADE UP OF MANUFACTURES OF CARPET. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE SECTION OF THE BILL TWO OF THEM DOING WITH DIFFERENTIAL WHICH I WON'T BRING UP TODAY BUT THE FINES INCREASES FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WITHOUT SHOWING ANY NEGLIGENCE. AND INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT A WRONGFUL MISCONDUCT WE WE THAT THE CURRENT FINDS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW OF THE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE BELIEVE THAT IS A APPROPRIATE. I IN THE PAST THERE HAS BEEN A MINISTRY TO LAW JUDGES DECISIONS AGAINST CARE HOWEVER IN EVERY INSTANCE THOSE. FINES WERE REDUCED BECAUSE WAS NEVER ANY FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE WRONGFUL MISCONDUCT AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MORE OF A PUNITIVE MEASURE ON THE PART OF CAL RECYCLING TRYING TO INCREASE THE FINES. BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT ACHIEVE THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE PROCESS THE FINES THAT THEY REALLY WANTED TO IMPOSE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU A PLEASE GO AHEAD MIGHT MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF MOHAWK INDUSTRIES CARPET MANUFACTURED MEMBER OF THE OF CARE THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION CREATE. THIS COMMITTEE TAKING THE TIME TO TO HEAR THE MERITS OR LACK OF MERIT OF OF INCREASING THAT THE FINE AUTHORITY OF CAL RECYCLE IN THIS IN THIS MANNER -- AS AS METROPOLITAN REPORT -- RECOGNIZE NOTED -- THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IN THE AUTHOR BELIEVE THAT. INCREASING CIVIL PENALTIES AGAINST CARE WOULD SOMEHOW CREATE NEW MARKETS I THINK FOR FOR FOR REFER RECYCLE MATERIAL -- WHAT WHAT RAINY DIDN'T POINT OUT IS THAT WHEN THIS MYSTERY LODGES HAVE REDUCE PREVIOUS FINES LEVIED AGAINST CARE -- THE MINISTRY LAW JUDGES NOTED THAT THEY CARE THE CARE IS EVEN MORE OF A OF A VICTIM OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RECYCLING THE WORLD RIGHT RECYCLING MARKETS AND NOT OF ANY IN THE EIGHTY S. -- MALICIOUS INTENTION AND IN FAILING TO MEET THEIR THEIR OWN SELF IMPOSED GOALS AND WE DON'T. JUST ADD ONE MORE THING IS THAT -- YOU KNOW GET ITS CARE SELF IMPOSED PLAN THEIR GOAL TO ME AND THEIR PROGRESS GOING UP TO DO THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING THAT. SELF IMPOSED GOALS OF FREEDOM AND LEVY FINES FOR NOT MEETING SELF IMPOSED GOALS IT'S IT'S SOMETHING IS WORTH NOTING THAT CARRY CYCLE HAS A SELF IMPOSED GOAL OF 75% RECYCLING BY THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY AND SINCE THEY MADE THAT GOAL THE WRIST THE OVERALL RECYCLING RATES ACTUALLY GONE DOWN SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME VOTE AS CARE IS IN THAT THIRD THERE'S A WORLDWIDE. PROBLEM OF RECYCLING MARKETS IN RATHER THAN GIVE CASH. RECYCLE MORE AUTHORITY TO FIND CARE WE JUST ASK THAT YOU YOU'LL LET CARE WORK AND FIND MY MARKETS IN AND DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'RE RECYCLING RATE IS INCHING UP. OPPOSITION. BENJAMIN PALMER ON BEHALF OF SHAW INDUSTRIES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS I'D LIKE OUR EXPERT ON RECYCLING AND DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR QUESTIONS WHY? I THINK AS I READ THE BILL MADAM CHAIR THAT IT JUST GIVES THE AUTHORITY THE CALORIE CYCLE TO GO UP. TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPOSE A FINE OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IT WAS TRIGGERED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES -- DETERMINATION THAT A MORE APPROPRIATE FINE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED SO I DON'T KNOW FOR GOING TO SEE A BIG. JUMP. AT LEAST. IN THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE THE RECYCLE THE VIRAL QUALITY COMMITTEE HAS A HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THIS ON THE RECYCLING SEPARATE JUST WITH THE FINES IT SEEMS TO BE IN LINE WITHOUT OTHER FINE SIEVE. HAVE WE'VE INCREASED THE AUTHORITY IN OTHER AREAS SO. AND IT DOESN'T NOTHING JUMPS OUT OF ME IS BEING. THANK RAGES RISHI EIGHT THAT. OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IS OUR MOTION.

MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRAIG PAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THE TITLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE -- SPECIFIC TO RECORDED DOCUMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF A COURT DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD BE THAT WE AND INTERPRET THROUGH THIS BILL THAT WOULD HAVE MAYBE SET UP SOME OF SYNONYMIZED. WERE FICTIONALIZED NAMES ON THEM AND THE THING THAT HAPPENS TO GO INTO THE RECORDING PROCESS WERE FREE TO THE TILE INDUSTRY WILL NOT PICK THESE UP. IN FOR CHILD SUPPORT -- WILL -- JUDGMENT LEANS OTHER LEANS OTHER DOCUMENTS IN WHICH WE NEED THE REAL NAME. AND THE TITLE INDUSTRIES BIB UNDER -- THE DEPARTMENT CHARTS FOR COLLECTION SERVICES IS COLLECTED AT THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CHILD SUPPORT A YEAR. AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO IT IS THROUGH DOCUMENTS LIKE THIS. AND WERE WERE AFRAID THAT THE PROTECTED PERSONS AND UNDER THIS BILL WOULD PROBABLY OFTEN BE THE ONES THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY MOST ADVERSELY IMPACTED. IN PROBABLY IN TRYING TO GET CHILD SUPPORT WE'RE TRYING TO GET MAYBE A MONEY JUDGMENT AGAINST AN AXE AND SO WE WITH. WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A SPECIFIC CAR ABOUT IN HERE FOR RECORDED DOCUMENTS IN A TALK TO THE TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT IT THAT'S THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY WERE LOOKING. FOR THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA ESCROW ASSOCIATION WERE POSE AND LESS AMENDED I THINK THE CHIEF COUNSEL'S ANALYSIS TONIGHT NICE JOB OF THE TENSION BETWEEN. KEEPING PEOPLE'S INFORMATION PRIVATE WHO DESERVE PROTECTION BUT SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS COMING OUT OF A COURT THAT ARE A JUDGMENT THAT WILL HAVE YOU NEED YOU NEED TO HAVE A JUDGMENT CREDITOR AND A JUDGMENT DEBTOR THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHO THEY ARE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING. A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR I THINK WE CAN GET THERE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE OF PROTECTING THESE FOLKS -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DOCUMENTS OF REFLECT THAT. IF THEY HAVE LEGAL AFFECT AS A LEANER JUDGMENT WE UNDERSTAND WHOSE WHOSE -- AT STAKE HERE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE DíAS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL THIS IS A WE HAVE. HISTORY STORIES OF THE VIOLENCE THAT IS COMMITTED BY. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PERPETRATORS COUNTIES THESE VICTIMS ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR PERPETRATOR HAVING THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC RECORDS AND WE KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE TOTALLY OBSESSED. WITH ANOTHER PERSON AND WE SEE THAT IN STALKING WE SEE THAT THE THESE ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET AWAY -- THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO AVOID THEIR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY SINCE SO I I APPRECIATE THIS I THINK THAT AMENDMENT PROPOSE WILL COMPLETELY UNDERMINE THE BILL BUT I WOULD ASK YOU TO KEEP. A TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY SO THAT -- IF ONE OF THESE. VICTIMS BECOMES. A DEAD BEAT OR HAS A JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM THAT THEY CAN'T HIDE BEHIND US I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENT I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY EVER THE INTENT WHEN SOMEONE'S. AFRAID OF THEIR PERPETRATOR -- SO I AM I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TALKING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND ONE THAT'S THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF STOCKING AND ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO.

IS A BASE A GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT AND IT'S A MATTER OF DIGNITY AND WORKER RIGHT. HOWEVER WORKERS ESPECIALLY LOW WAGE INDUSTRY WORKERS WAIT DAYS WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS. BEFORE THEIR PAGES THEIR PAYCHECKS ARE OFFERED TO THEM. THIS YEAR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ISSUED THE LARGEST CITY THE LARGEST CITATION IN STATE HISTORY. FINDING A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NEARLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REPEATED WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS WHICH LEFT OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WAITING WEEKS OR MONTHS FOR THEIR PAYCHECKS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THESE EMPLOYEES HAVE NO DIRECT RECOURSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IS ABLE TO RECOVER A PENALTY FROM EMPLOYERS WHEN WE JUST ARE NOT PAYING ON TIME BUT ACCORDING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. THIS PENALTY IS RARELY PURSUED OR COLLECTED. EVEN IF THESE PENALTIES WERE TO BE COLLECTED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THE PENALTIES GO TO THE STATE. AND NOT THE WORKER. UNDER AB SIX SEVEN THREE BE AVAILABLE LEGAL OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES SUBJECT IT SUBJECT TO TO WAIT THAT OUR EXPANDED IN THE PENALTY IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING WILL BE PAID DIRECTLY.

ONE OF MY CO WORKERS FACE EVICTION AND ANOTHER STRUGGLED -- TO FEED HIS FAMILY.

PAGE UPDATED THANK YOU JUST POKING. ALL RIGHT THE NEXT BILL UP IS OF OF FILE ITEM FIFTY SIX A. B.. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FILE ITEM FIFTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FORESHORES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN PROUD TO PRESENT AND MEMBERS PARTED WITH AND ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD INSURE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS HAVE THE OPTION OF A STRAIGHT FORWARD AN EXPEDITIOUS LEGAL PATHWAY TO JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THEIR EMPLOYERS WRONGDOING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I HAVE ACCEPTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY AND EMPLOYMENT TEENS THE OPTION TO EITHER FILE A COMPLAINT THROUGH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER OR PURSUE A PRIVATE ACTION AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER. UNDER CURRENT LAW SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STALKING MUST PROVIDE JOB PROTECTIVE. MUST BE PROVIDED JOB PROTECT THE TIME OFF TO SEEK MEDICAL LEGAL SOCIAL SERVICES AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS. IN THE WORKPLACE A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 38% OF SURVIVORS REPORT EITHER HAVING BEEN FIRED OR FEARING TERMINATION BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. AND 34% REPORT HAVING TO QUIT A JOB DUE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CURRENTLY SUPERVISORS RESPONDING TO THIS MISTREATMENT ARE ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. OR PURSUE A CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PAGA. AFTER MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS OF PROCEEDINGS THE PAGA CLAIM SURVIVORS ARE ONLY ABLE TO COLLECT 25% OF A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE. THIS OUTCOME IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR SURVIVORS GIVEN THAT THEY MUST INDOOR A LINK THE LEGAL PROCESS. AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IS CERTAINLY NOT PROPORTIONATE TO THE DISCRIMINATION THEY FACE IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AND ALTERNATIVE LEGAL AVENUE IN FORM OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. KNOWN AS P. R. A.. B. R. A.'S OFFERED A ROUTE TO ACTION THAT GOES BEYOND THE LIMITED SCOPE OF PAGA OR A COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ENSURING THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS CAN PROPERLY ADDRESS THE DISCRIMINATION AND MISTREATMENT. THAT THEY HAVE FACED IN THE WORKPLACE HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY. IS LARRY DOYLE WITH THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS AND CATHERINE OF WHICH IT WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK. VERY GOOD GOOD EVENING. TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS KATHERINE WHICH AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK THE NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF LOW INCOME WORKERS. AND I'M HERE'S A STRONG SUPPORTER OF AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS FAR TOO COMMON AND CAN BE DEVASTATING PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND FINANCIALLY SURVIVORS FREQUENTLY FIND THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY MUST PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES. AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN ON THEIR OWN SOMETIMES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS AT THE SAME MOMENT THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK TO RELOCATE OR TO SEEK OTHER PROTECTIVE SERVICES. OFTEN WHEN THEY DO THIS THEY EXPERIENCE RETALIATION OR TERMINATION AT WRK AND THE LAW SAYS THIS IS A LEGAL BUT GENERALLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT. A SURVIVOR CAN FILE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT BUT THE PROCESS IS CONFUSING AND SLOW IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT MORE THAN SIX MONTHS BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION EVEN STARTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONLY TO INDIVIDUALS MADE COMPLAINTS TO THE DEAL AS THE BASED ON THEIR EMPLOYER'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE LEAVE FOR SAFETY PLANNING OR MEDICAL CARE. AND ONLY EIGHT COMPLAIN THAT THEIR EMPLOYERS FAILED TO PROVIDE SAFETY ACCOMMODATIONS AND BASED ON THE STATISTICS IN THE CALLS THAT LEGALLY THAT WERE GUESTS WE KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T BECAUSE THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A VIABLE ROUTE FOR SURVIVORS. CALIFORNIA ALLOWS WORKERS FACING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN SEX TO FIND AN ATTORNEY AND TO SEEK JUSTICE THERE'S NO REASON THAT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A MUCH SMALLER. OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT SAME RIGHT. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS THE READER ALONG HAVE THE CONFERENCE THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. THE ISSUES ARE SET FORTH VERY WELL IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. BASICALLY WE HAVE A SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WHICH PROVIDES TO REMEDIES. NEITHER OF WHICH SEEMS TO BE -- SUFFICIENT TO THE CASE. FILING A CLAIM WITH THE LABOR STANDARDS. THE COMMISSION -- IS TOO LONG AND PROVIDES. DOES NOT PROVIDE AN AMPLE PROTECTION FOR THE SURVIVOR. AND PAGA IS A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AND DOESN'T PROVIDE ANYTHING REALLY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. US FOR THOSE REASONS IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE GO FOR A OF PERMITTING PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND ALLOW. VICTIMS -- KEYS TO SURVIVORS. TO GET AN ATTORNEY AND TO SEEK THE JUSTICE THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU WHAT A NOTION OF ALL RIGHT SO -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION THAT'S BECAUSE CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. HAPPEN FASTER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. CAN L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G ON BEHALF OF THE&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PROUD CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. NO I PART OF MOST C. R. L. AID FOUNDATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S AWFULLY ENERGETIC FOR THE SHOWER THE NIGHT BUT VERY IMPRESSIVE. NORTON DATA INTO THE WHOLE THANK YOU MUCH MUCH APPRECIATE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. LET ME GUESS YOU DON'T LIKE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. UNFORTUNATELY NOTAND MADAM CHAIR I REALIZE WHATEVER THE OPPOSITE OF PREACHING TO THE CHOIR ON THAT ISSUE AS I I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING HERE -- BUT WE ARE OPPOSED UNFORTUNATELY THE A. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT DOES CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER WE JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT ADDED THESE LEAVE PROTECTIONS. MADAM CHAIR YOUR SB FOUR HUNDRED FROM. TO TWENTY THIRTEEN ORIGINALLY CONTAINED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT WAS REMOVED DURING THE PROCESS BEFORE THE BILL WAS SENT TO THE GOVERNOR. NOT BY MY CHOICE I UNDERSTAND. WE HAD WE HAD ALSO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL'S LANGUAGE. AND DUPLICATIVE CLAIMS WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF. PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR ARGUMENTS ON THAT ISSUE AND AND WORKING ON THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE BEEN RAISING THAT ISSUE THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE THAT -- TOOK THE TIME TO TO UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS AND AN ADDRESS AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT -- AGAIN WE THINK. THE DEAL SEE PROCESS IS NOT PERFECT -- BUT WE DO THINK IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AS I AS I MENTIONED ON THE KALRA BILL. DATA FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN REFLECTS THAT AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CASE RETALIATION CASES WERE OPENED FOR INVESTIGATION. THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE CLAIMS UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX OR ELEVEN A TWO POINT FIVE I'M NOT LABOR CODE SECTIONS TWO THIRTY INTO THIRTY POINT ONE THE SECTIONS AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL. ONLY FIFTY SEVEN OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE POINT 001% FELL UNDER THOSE LABOR COULD PROVISIONS. AND SECONDLY WHILE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED RETALIATION CASES WERE OPEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEAL SEE ALSO CLOSE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED CASES. AND AGAIN THE DEAL IS TO REPORT NOTED THERE WERE ONLY FOUR CASES REMAINING UNASSIGNED AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. SO ONCE AGAIN WE BELIEVE THE DLC RETALIATION PROCESS HAS BEEN APPROVED AND WE DON'T SEE THE NEED TO CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THOSE REASONS WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PREACH TO THE NON CHOIR. FOR THE ANTI CHOIR I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS THANK YOU% ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS AND I I WANT TO THANK YOU AS WAS JUST MENTIONED I DID SIMILAR LEGISLATION TO THIS TO BE ABLE. TO AGAIN -- GOING TO COURT AND TO TRY TO RESOLVE THESE. CONCERNS IN A IN A WAY THAT CAN BE MEANINGFUL AND TO HAVING THESE OPTIONS I THINK MAKES IT POSSIBLE. SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MOVED BY SENATOR AND SALAS. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR PAVING THE WAY WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT ALLOWS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHEN AND HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THEIR CASE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST MY VOTE. THANK YOU.

TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS THAT COST AND EXPOSURE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I HAVE ACCEPTED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS. INDUSTRIES CONCERNS REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION SUCH SUCH AS INCLUDING LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT FACILITIES THAT ARE PENDING PERMIT APPROVAL ARE NOT PENALIZED BY THIS BILL. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND CALIFORNIA MULTIPLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE JURISDICTION OVER BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE AND GENERATE. HAZARDOUS WASTE AND MATERIALS THAT POSE A RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. LOCALLY A CERTIFIED YOU IN A CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY OTHERS KNOWN AS COOPER IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IN WAY FLAWS. IN THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER HAS GENERAL AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND EXPAND THE THORNY ONLY AFTER A COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY IS DECLARED. CURRENTLY SOME FACILITIES THAT EMIT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES CONTINUE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET THE REGULATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO CEASE OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES BEGINS. IT IS ACTUALLY BE EXIDE BATTERY REFER RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA WHICH CONTINUES THE EXPOS FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS OF NOT ONLY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE BUT THREE OR FOUR OTHER ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS AS WELL AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO DANGERS TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF TALKS THAT LED. TOXIC LEAD. THE DELAY TO SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY -- DOWN. WITH THEIR LEAD EMISSIONS FROM THE PLAN CONTAMINATED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ACROSS NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES INCLUDING BOYLE HEIGHTS. ANY STYLE A AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED AS A RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS EXPRESSED BY OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOLLOWING A HEARING. WHICH WE DID LAST YEAR. THE BILL IS IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CLOSEST TO THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY TOXIC POLLUTION.

FIVE FEET CALMLY WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WERE POWER CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALL APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE I AM TAKING THE PLACE OF ONE OF OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. WHO ACTUALLY HAD TO JUMP ON A PLANE -- DUE TO THE LATENESS OF HOW WE GOT HERE SO -- I WILL DO THE BEST I CAN I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF BECAUSE OF THAT. I AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS ABOUT BUILDING ON EXISTING LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER THIRTY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HELP. LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE THE CURRENT LONG STANDING AUTHORITY TO IMMEDIATELY ORDER THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF A CONTAMINATED BEACH TO ORDER THE CLOSURE OF A RESTAURANT FOR INSANITARY CONDITIONS OR TO TAKE ANY ACTION NECESSARY IN RESPONSE TO FOOD AND WATER BORNE ILLNESSES. OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AUTHORITY OVER THESE ENTITIES IS BASED ON AN ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT MUST PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASE OR THE OCCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL CASES WHENEVER POSSIBLE. HOWEVER WHEN A CHEMICAL THREAT ENDANGERS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS LACKS STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO TAKE SIMILAR IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREO EXPLAIN ITS FACE NUMEROUS CRISES IN WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE PARTIES RELEASE CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT PRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO MY AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AUTHORITY OVER CHEMICAL THREATS WITH THIS ESTABLISH AUTHORITY TO STOP BIOLOGICAL THREATS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- PROUD TO PRESENT TO THEM THE BILL -- SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE A BILL THAT INSURES ALL IMMIGRANTS NO MATTER IF THEY COME FROM LATIN AMERICA ASIA AFRICA OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD ONLY RECEIVE. HIGHLY IMPORTANCE LEGAL ADVICE FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE LEGAL EDUCATION AND EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE SUCH ASSISTANCE AND LET ME JUST START BY ALSO SEEN. BIG THANK YOU TO YOU AND TO THE WONDERFUL STAFF OF YOUR COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH WITH ME ON ON THIS BILL AND AND WITH MY TEAM. IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FEDERAL POLICY WAS MODIFY THAT PUTS IMMIGRANTS AT GREATER RISK OF DEPORTATION BY ALLOWING OFFICIALS TO START THE DEPORTATION PROCESS. FOR TONIGHT IMMIGRATION PETITIONS AND TO REFER CASES TO THE IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ICE. ON CRIMINAL OR SECURITY GROUNDS THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS NEARLY 35% OF LA COUNTY. I'LL LA COUNTY TEN MILLION RESIDENTS WERE BORN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY MYSELF INCLUDED. ESTIMATES FURTHER INDICATE THAT APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LIVE IN LA COUNTY MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE VULNERABLE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HIRING IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT OFTEN COST LESS THAN HIRING ATTORNEY BUT THE RISK OF POTENTIAL DEPORTATION A DENIAL OF CITIZENSHIP. OR RESIDENCY INVOLVED IN HIRING A LOWER COST IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS FAR AWAY THE COST BENEFIT. THE CURRENT EXPAND THE DISCRETION OF FEDERAL OFFICIALS TO DENY IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS LEAVES NO ROOM FOR ERROR IN THE ACCURACY. THE MISSION AND COMPLETENESS OF IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS AND EVEN IF ERRORS CAN BE RECTIFIED AFFECTED IMMIGRANT VICTIMS OFTEN LACK THE ABILITY TO CORRECT MISTAKES TO BE IT FOR THE LACK OF RESOURCES. FEAR OF RETALIATION OR GOVERNMENT DISTRESS AB. SEVENTEEN FIFTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY MAKE IT UNLAWFUL FOR A PERSON OTHER THAN A LICENSED ATTORNEY. A PARALEGAL UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN ATTORNEY OR A PERSON OR ORGANIZATION FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUALS IN IMMIGRATION MATTERS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION RELATED SERVICES FOR A FEE IN CALIFORNIA.

OPPONENTS MAY ARGUE CURRENT CAPACITY CANNOT FILL THE VOID THE CONSULTANTS CAN NO LONGER OPERATE BUT THE LEGISLATURE AND BOTH THE BROWN AND NEWSOME ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE HOPE CHANGE THAT AND INCREASE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION RELATED LEGAL SERVICES THROUGH THE ONE CALIFORNIA FUND AND BY INCREASING THE EQUAL ACCESS FUND THOSE FUNDING STREAMS BOTH ACCOMPANIED BY RIGOROUS OVERSIGHT. ALLOWED US ITS APPEAL SEE TO BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY. THE STATE SIMPLY SHOULD NOT AUTHORIZE PERSONS NO MATTER HOW WILL MEAN IT MIGHT BE A PRACTICE IMMIGRATION WATER NOT LAWYERS OR OTHERWISE AUTHORIZED BY FEDERAL LAW.

ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION ALRIGHT BRING THE BILL BACK TO THE DíAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES SENATOR Y. CASKEY. I I GOT THIS LETTER FROM THIS THE LEGAL. SERVICES WITH KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THEY'RE IN COMPETITION WITH THESE CONSULTANTS AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FRAUD BY NON LAWYERS IS A HORRIBLE THING AND BUT THERE'S AN UNMET NEEDS. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS MY QUESTION THIS I SIX OH ONE A FORMER WHICH THEY SAY IT'S A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD FORM TAKES A LOT OF DECLARATIONS AND TAX RETURNS IN LETTERS. BUT THAT SOMETIMES THE YOU KNOW THEY CHARGE FIVE THOUSAND BUCKS THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE CONSULTANTS CHARGE FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS SOMETIMES THEY WILL REFER. THE THIS SERVICE TO BECAUSE THE CLIENTS CAN PAY THEM TO THE CONSULTANTS AND OTHER TIMES CONSULTANTS WILL ADMIT THAT THIS THIS TO TOUGH OF A CASE FOR US TO HANDLE WE WILL REFER TO THE LAWYERS. THE IMMIGRATION LAWYERS AND THEY SAY THAT THAT SORT OF HIS BEEN THIS BALANCE THAT. OF NOT PRACTICING LAW BUT FILLING OUT FORMS CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. UNMET NEED FOR LACK OF FUNDS TO PAY FOR SERVICES AT LEAST THIS ONE LAW ALFA SAYS. THERE'S SAID BALANCING ACT THAT GOES ON SURE. THANK YOU SENATOR SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S AN UNMET NEED. THE SERVICE SHOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ATTORNEY AND THE LAW OFFICE SHOULD MAKE ITSELF RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE OUTCOME THE I. SIX A WHEN A IF APPROVED BY THE CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES REQUIRES THE INDIVIDUAL TO GO ABROAD -- AND THEN CONSULAR PROCESS IN ORDER TO COME BACK TO THE US WITH LAWFUL STATUS PEOPLE WHO DO THAT. CAN GET STUCK ABROAD FOR YEARS OR PERMANENTLY SO IT'S AN EXTREMELY HIGH RISK SITUATION. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A CAPACITY CONCERN. THE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT INDUSTRY IS NOT AND IS NEVER GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION TO THE STATE'S CAPACITY CONCERNS A CAPACITY HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BUT THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT AND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT OFFICE HAS A RELATIONSHIP. IT SHOULD BE OVERSEEING THE WORK AND MAKING ITSELF ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE. NON LEGAL PROVIDERS THANK YOU OF OUR WILL THE CENTER MORNING AND THEN A SENATOR ROSTER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS IN OUNCES REFLECTS A SIMILAR BILL. FAILED TO PASS THE SENATE LAST YEAR. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THE DRAFTING OF THIS. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR'S BILL. THE THE LANGUAGES SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR -- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXTERNAL -- CIRCUMSTANCES -- AMONG THEM THE THE HEIGHTENED RISK FOR IMMIGRANTS THAT WAS DESCRIBED ON AND A PUBLISHED DECISION RECENTLY ON MAY SECOND -- BY THE CALIFORNIA OF FIFTH APPELLATE DISTRICT THAT REALLY E. DICTATES THAT -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS ARE IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW -- AT PRESENT TIME. ON SO FOR THAT REASON WE ARE PROCEEDING WITH THE THE LANGUAGE AS CONSTITUTED IN THE PRIOR VERSION. I WOULD ALSO ADD SENATOR THAT -- THE SUPPORT. FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THAN WHAT IT WAS LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS AND THE IN THE INFORMATION FACT SHEET ON ON THE BILL. AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE. HAVING PRACTICED IMMIGRATION ON THE SALINAS VALLEY. THE STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN MISLED IN -- CHARGED HUGE SUMS OF MONEY LEADING. TO NOTHING SOMETIMES TO DEPORTATION. IS OUTRAGEOUS. BY THE SAME TOKEN I THINK SOME OF THE PEOPLE WE HEARD FROM HERE TODAY. OUR SINCERE AND EARNEST COMMUNITY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE WORKING WITH NON PROFITS -- TRYING TO MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE -- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEED [inaudible] FOR BETTER REGULATION. LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT I WOULD THINK A PATHWAY FOR SOME OF THOSE WHO FEEL THAT. THEY WILL LOSE SOME. THEIR FUTURE OR THE ABILITY TO KEEP DOING THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING. WOULD BE TO AFFILIATE WITH AN ATTORNEY UNDER WHOSE SUPERVISION. THEY COULD WORK. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE GOAL FOR THOSE THAT ARE COMMITTED. TO FAIR - REPRESENTATION. UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND SUPERVISION OF A SKILLED ATTORNEY THERE'S ALSO RECOURSE THAN FOR SOMEBODY. WHO MIGHT BE MISREPRESENTED OR MISLED? THROUGH THE STATE BAR -- BASED ON THAT SUPERVISING ATTORNEY I AM TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TODAY I SUPPORTED OUT LAST YEAR -- I JUST THINK THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH THE DEMAND IS SO GREAT. BUT WITH THE CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCE GETTING WORSE SINCE LAST YEAR IT ALSO RAISES. THE RISK OF EXPLOITATION THE DESPERATION IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE THE FEAR OF RAIDS AND DEPORTATION. AN WHILE THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE EARNEST AND WELL INTENTIONED. IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THERE'S A RICH HISTORY OF PEOPLE MORE THAN READY TO TAKE PEOPLE'S MONEY -- IN PROVIDE NO SERVICE THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY TO REGULATE THIS I THINK WORKING. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ATTORNEY WHO'S ACCOUNTABLE TO THE STATE BAR -- WOULD BE A PATH FORWARD FOR EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TWO WE HAVE CENTERS STERN CHINNOR GONZALEZ IN ANSWER SENATOR RUSSELL SENATOR STIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- ATTY I WAS WRESTLING WITH HIS LAST YEAR. IN THE SAME SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES SENATOR MONNING POINTED OUT -- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THE NEED HAS GROWN. ITEM IN THE STAKES ARE. GETTING HIGHER. BY THE DAY -- I WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE THOUGH ON SOME OF THE AMENDMENT IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY -- SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BECAUSE I WORRY ABOUT -- THROWING OUT THE GOOD WITH THE BAD HERE AND TRYING TO FIND SOME PATH TO SAY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CRACKED. ON ILLEGITIMATE NO TADI OWES WHO ARE EXTENDING THEMSELVES ARE PRETENDING THAT THEIR LAWYERS WHEN THEY'RE REALLY NOT -- WITHOUT. UNDERCUTTING IMPORTANT. SUPPLY SIDE ESSENTIALLY A WORK FORCE TO HELP FOLKS THROUGH THE MORE MINISTERIAL NON. LEGAL PRACTICE ELEMENT SO AND I'M LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THE AMENDS THAT APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN OFFERED -- FROM CHANGING THE TITLE IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT TO IMMIGRATION FORMER ASSISTANT TO REMOVING IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT FROM PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES LIKE ASYLUM AND WITHHOLDING. OF REMOVAL AND VIA THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT ISSUES -- TO SORT OF BEEFING UP THE MINIMUM EDUCATION LEGAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS OR EVEN JUST ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AT I HAVEN'T SEEN PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HERE BUT BUT EVEN YOU KNOW. EMPOWER CITIZENS TO GO AFTER THESE ILLEGITIMATE ACTORS OR NOT JUST PUTTING IT ALL IN SORT OF THE COUNTIES ARE AG TO TAKE CARE OF THIS STUFF SO JUST GET A REACTION FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT -- TAKE ON SOME OF THOSE OFFERS IN -- WHERE YOU STAND ON IT? SURE WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE JUST DISCUSSED BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY A CASE THE PEOPLE VERSUS HEALTHY -- WHICH IS ACTUALLY OF THIS YEAR -- THAT IS PERTINENT TO THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT TO THIS TIME. AND WE BELIEVE THAT ANY AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW INDIVIDUALS BEYOND THE CURRENT FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED GROUPS TO PROVIDE IMMIGRATION SERVICES ACTUALLY WOULD BE PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. AND SEND THAT SEN ON PAGE NINE AND TEN OF THE BILL ANALYSIS. I'M READING THAT CASE -- I MEAN I I WENT THROUGH IT A LITTLE BIT TRY TO DO MY HOMEWORK HERE IN. IT. IT'S SORT OF SAYS THAT. IT ALSO SAYS -- THE ACT DOES NOT PURPORT TO ALLOW ANYONE TO VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW A PERSON STILL MUST BE FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED OR TO PROVIDE ANY KIND OF REPRESENTATION BUT IT DOES SAY YOU KNOW THAT A PERSON WHO IS NOT COMPLY WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS CANNOT FILL OUT THE FORMS. DIDN'T SEEM TO SORT OF WHOLE CLOTH THOUGH ELIMINATE OR PREEMPT I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE CAN WRESTLE WITH THAT ONE SECOND NO WE'RE SHORT ON TIME HERE BUT I SENATOR BRIEFLY IF I MAY YEAH I DID MENTION THAT IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE PERSON BE FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED. THERE IS NO CATEGORY OF IMMIGRATION CONSULTANT IN THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IT DOES NOT EXIST SO CALIFORNIA WE'RE TO AFFIRMATIVELY AUTHORIZE THIS GROUP -- TO PREPARE FORMS AND SEVEN APPLICATIONS I'M IN A WAY THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS DO NOT. WE WOULD HAVE A PREEMPTION PROBLEM THERE IS ONE EXTREMELY NARROW EXCEPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO. BILLION BLANK SPACES UNPREPARED FORMS UP FREE OF CHARGE OR FOR A NOMINAL FEE WITHOUT HOLDING THEMSELVES OUT AS BEING HAS HAVING ANY EXPERTISE IN IMMIGRATION PROCEDURE. ON IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS DO NOT ACT WITHIN THAT EXTREMELY NARROW CONFINES OF THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. ON WITH THIS BILL ELIMINATE THOSE PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT KIND OF WORK THOUGH. THE BILL COULD NOT DO THAT IF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS AUTHORIZE THAT -- BUT PRESUMABLY WOULD NOT DO THAT. SO THE THE ISSUE HERE IS CALIFORNIA AUTHORIZING PROVIDERS BEYOND THOSE SPECIFICALLY LISTED IN THE REGULATIONS. SO IF WE WERE TO AUTHORIZE LEGAL TRAINING FOR EXAMPLE I'M AND THEN INDICATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE HAVE THIS CLASS IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN PREPARE FORMS AND SUBMIT THEM. TO THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IN A WAY THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS DON'T ALLOW THAT WOULD BE PREEMPTED SENATE. THEY ALLOW THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY FOR FOR FOR PEOPLE TO FILL OUT THE SORT OF MINISTERIAL FORMS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S WHOLE CLOTH ELIMINATES IMMIGRATION CONSULTING FROM DOING. THAT KIND MINISTER WORK YOU'RE SAYING THE FEDERAL CASE LAW ALLOWS WELL THE FEDERAL EXCEPTION IS FOR A NOTARY PUBLIC FILLING OUT A PREPRINTED FORM FREE OF CHARGE OR FOR A NOMINAL FEE. AND SO ON THAT IS THE ONE EXCEPTION WITH. SENATOR AND IF I MAY MAKE NO THANK YOU -- I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR POTS WELCOME THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE BILL ACTUALLY ELIMINATES PEOPLE FROM DOING THAT WORK IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S IS THAT THE QUESTION AND YES THIS BILL DOES HIS BILL ELIMINATE PEOPLE FROM DOING THEIR WORK WHAT YOU. SAID IS THAT IT DOES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WITHIN THE FEDERAL FRAMEWORK -- AND DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT TEN OTHER STATES ALREADY ALLOW IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS TO DO THIS WORK INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PRE EMPTED. AND FOR CALIFORNIA TO CREATE THIS ACT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND FOR NO CHANGES TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE OR FEDERALLY BUT NOW ALL THE SEND IN THEIR CLAIMING IT'S PREEMPTION. THE COURT ONLY HELD THAT IMPOSING PENALTIES ON IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS FOR PRACTICING LAW WITHOUT A PRACTICE. THAT WE I'M SORRY WITHOUT AYE WE'RE NOT THERE. YET CLEARLY ON THAT YEAH LOOK LET ME TRY TO SEE IF I CAN AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON BY ELIMINATING THIS LAW DOES NOT ELIMINATE. THE ABILITY TO TO TO TO COMPLY OR TO PARTICIPATING WITH THE FEDERAL LAW. CALLS. FOR IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOUR AND IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS CURRENTLY DO NOT COMPLY WITH WHAT THE ORIGIN ONLY HANDLES REPRESENTATION UNDER FEDERAL MATTERS. OKAY THANK YOU -- CENTER GONZALEZ. YES I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THIS BOB THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW I'VE MET WITH SOME OF THE IN IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS AND I KNOW THAT THIS ACT DEFINITELY NEEDS AN UPGRADE -- I COME FROM A DISTRICT THAT NOT ONLY HAS AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF LATINOS IN THE DISTRICT BUT ALSO AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CAMBODIAN REFUGEES. WHO COME HERE SEEK ASYLUM AND UNFORTUNATELY -- HAVING GIVEN VERY BAD ADVICE -- FROM IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS AND I DO BELIEVE VERY FIRMLY THAT WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE GIVING AND PROVIDING AS MUCH INFORMATION. AS WE CAN AND ALSO ENSURING THAT RATES ARE STANDARDIZED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE I KNOW -- WE HEAR IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND IT'S REALLY DOES DOES HEARTENING AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO SEE THIS SO. I WOULD ALSO SAY AND THE COMMITTEES -- ANALYSIS AS WELL WAS PHENOMENAL I THINK OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THIS I THINK JUST IN ITSELF THE FORM SELECTION FROM THE GET GO IS A LEGAL PROCEDURE AND PROCESS THAT. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE FOR ME JUST HIT IT COMPLETELY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR ROSS OF I'VE BEEN AROUND. THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE IN THE IMMIGRATION MOMENT MY ENTIRE LIFE. I AM NOT AND TURNING. AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT I EVER DID EITHER AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ARE AS A UNION. REPRESENTED OVER OFFICER. ALWAYS HAD AN ATTORNEY. TO REVIEW THE WORK. ON IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY BE SURE. THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ONE THING THAT MR GOOD DATA SAID WHICH I'M TOTALLY THE AGREEMENT WITH IS WE NEED CAPACITY. WE NEED TO BUILD CAPACITY THIS IS A TIME WHEN MUCH MUCH MORE CAPACITY IS NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITY. BUT SHOULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF NOT DOING THE QUALITY REPRESENTATION THAT OUR COMMUNITY DESERVES. AND ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CASES -- I'VE HEARD I'VE SEEN I'VE SAT THROUGH ARE SO UNIQUE CASE BY CASE BY CASE. SO I CAN APPRECIATE THE EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP. BY EVERYONE HERE WHO TESTIFIED THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE NEED TO HAVE THAT FINAL ROM REVIEW. UP BY AN ATTORNEY SO I I REALLY THINK THAT FOR NOW THIS IS THE WAY. TO GO BUT I URGE THAT WE ALL KEEP TALKING -- TO THE COMMUNITY OF IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS -- BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NOT JUST BE SURE OF THE SITE. THEY PLAY A PART IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THAT EXPERTISE. IN THIS MOMENT WHEN EVERYWHERE WHAT WE NEEDED SO MUCH MORE THAN WE EVER DID BEFORE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK IN A NUTSHELL WE NEED TO WE PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE THESE FOLKS PARTICIPATING BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD QUALITY PEOPLE AND I AGREE WITH. YOU FROM THE MOMENT YOU FILL OUT THAT FORM YOU'RE PRACTICING LAW YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS. SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE KNOW THIS WELL BUT THEY'D BUT TO HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE. ACCESSIBILITY AND QUALITY YOU KNOW DO NO HARM SOMETIMES AND WHEN WE FIND PEOPLE WHO RELIED ON THOSE WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF A POOR LEGAL ADVICE SAID JETS. ALMOST CRIMINAL SO -- HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIGURE OUT SOME WAY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST RODEO ON THIS BILL -- BUT I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS IN THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS SOME SO.

THAT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE FOR THIS BILL. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND ANYONE THAT FILLS OUT ANYTHING HAPPEN RELATED TO DO WITH IMMIGRATION AND HELPING PEOPLE STAY IN THIS COUNTRY. ILLEGALLY OR EVEN AN ATTEMPT TO APPLY FOR RESIDENCY IN A POT AND ATTEMPT TO APPLY FOR ITIZENSHIP. IT'S WHAT WE NEED NOW.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH DESERVED -- FIFTY ONE AB FORTINO. FOR I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. I THINK MANAGER THIS IS SIMPLE BILL IS JUST ABOUT TRANSPARENCY DISCLOSURE AND FAIRNESS PLAIN AND SIMPLE AB FORTINO -- FOR WOULD HOPE WOULD NOT DISCLOSE THE FIRST COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE -- CORPORATIONS AND FOR PROFIT ENTITIES -- IT I DON'T THINK WE COULD ARGUE THE RISING EXECUTIVE COMPOSITION REMAINS ISHAR HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY TODAY. AND COMPOSITION OF FOR COMPENSATION FOR HEALTHCARE EXECUTIVES HAVE RISEN ABOUT 93%. I BETWEEN THE YEARS A CONTINUES -- THE PUSH UP BY HEALTH CARE COST. A STUDY THAT FOUND NO LINK -- HOWEVER BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF CARE AND EXECUTIVE COMPOSITION IS AN INCREASE INCREASES -- IN SPITE OF THIS NOT NONE THE LESS NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE CORPORATIONS ARE USING TO FOR COMPOSITION PROGRAMS TO INCREASE -- COMPENSATION FOR THE CEOS EXECUTIVES ABLE TO USE RETIREMENT PLANS -- TO ALLOW THEM TO DEFER SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THEIR INCOME AND AND AVOID SIGNIFICANT TAX LIABILITIES. A TO PRISM PLAIN SIMPLE BILL WE'RE NOT ASKING -- A NONPROFIT DISCLOSE -- WHAT THEY DON'T ALREADY DISCLOSE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES I MEAN FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEY MAKE -- IN AND IT'S TRANSPARENCY -- WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING HIM TO DISCLOSE A LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE SUBSIDIES TO DEFERRED COMPENSATION -- TO A FOR PROFIT CORPORATION -- WE HAVE THE WITNESS MADAM. CHAIR IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT -- ABSOLUTELY IF HE SAYS SPEAKS FOR IN TWO MINUTES OR LESS. BURGER MATT WAS A WITH AN S. YEAH YOU YOU H. W. -- CHAIR MEMBERS WE EXEMPT NONPROFIT FROM -- TAXES TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRIBLE WORKS -- THESE TAX SUBSIDIES THAT WE PROVIDE IS ESSENTIALLY -- FUNCTIONALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN OUR CONSTITUENTS YOUR CONSTITUENTS WRITING A CHECK TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH THEIR CHARITABLE WORK -- AND THIS IS A BIG CHECK PARTICULARLY IN HEALTH CARE -- WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THE NONPROFIT KAISER FOUNDATION WHICH TAKES IN ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS WITH THE REVENUE -- LAST YEAR -- IF THEY PAY TAXES LIKE A FOR PROFIT ENTITY WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT MONEY COULD BE USED TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED ARE UNDOCUMENTED ANYTHING THAT YOU CHOOSE -- BUT SOMETHING USE UNIQUE HOT IS HAPPENING -- WITH OUR LARGEST TAX SUBSIDIZED HEALTH INSURER AND IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO -- AS YOU KNOW -- KAISER IS NOT JUST A SINGLE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA IT IS COMPOSED OF FOUR DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITIES TO A WHICH ARE FOR PROFIT MEDICAL GROUPS. THESE MEDICAL GROUPS ARE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES PRIVATELY HELD -- THAT PROVIDE DOCTOR AND MEDICAL CARE TO THE FOUNDATION INSURANCE -- CUSTOMERS WELL WE DO NOT HAVE INSIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATIONS INTO THE FINANCES OR INCENTIVES OF THESE -- OF THESE FOR PROFIT ENTITIES WE DO KNOW THAT THE FOR PROFIT MEDICAL GROUP CHARGES BILLIONS IN FEES TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR THE FOUNDATION PATIENTS. WE KNOW THAT ON TOP OF THOSE BILLIONS THEY ALSO -- CHARGE SEPARATELY FOR NON POP FOR EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER COMPENSATION -- THROUGH THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS JUST TO SAY THAT AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR IN ADDITION TO PAYING FOR THE DOCTOR SERVICES THEY PROVIDE RETIREMENT AND PAID DIRECTLY THE RETIREMENT -- SERVICES SEPARATELY -- TO THAT -- EXECUTIVES OF THE FOR PROFIT MISS. IT IS SIGNIFICANT IT IS ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT IS BILLION WITH A B. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SIMPLY SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COME FORWARD. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WAS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON TWO HUNDRED HI GOOD EVENING -- AND HOW I GOT INVOLVED WITH KAISER PERMANENTE IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. -- FOURTEEN FOR THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY HOWEVER LET'S BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO TARGET ONLY KAISER PERMANENT TAKE AND THE PHYSICIANS WHO SERVE OUR MEMBERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS DO NOT ADDRESS THE VERY SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS WE RAISED AND WE STILL BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION UNFAIRLY TARGETS ARE DOCTORS. AND FOR THAT REASON WE REMAIN OPPOSED. IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE LISTING OBLIGATION SUBSECTION A OF THE AMENDMENTS ARE TO BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE FROM THE BANDING OBLIGATIONS IN SUBSECTION BE. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE KP TO COLLECT AND SUBMIT FOR PUBLICATION THE COMPENSATION INFORMATION OF AT LEAST SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS WHO PROVIDE EXCELLENT CARE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. K. F. H. P. HAS OFFERED A PENSION BENEFIT TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR PHYSICIANS KNOWN AS THE COMMON PLANT. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR UP SOME MISINFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS PENSION PLAN IS. THE COMMON PLAN IS ALREADY PUBLICLY DISCO DISCLOSE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CAGE CAMP H. P.. THE FINANCIAL PORTS GIVE SUBSTANTIAL DETAIL ABOUT THE POSITION PENSIONS INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF ACCRUED LIABILITIES DESCRIPTION OF THE BENEFIT AMOUNTS PAID. AS DESCRIBED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT THE COMMON PLAN AS A SEVEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET IT IS AN UNFUNDED PROMISED BY THE HEALTH PLAN TO PAY ELIGIBLE PHYSICIANS A BENEFITS UPON RETIREMENT. ARE THE COMMON PLAN CONTRASTS WITH THE RETIREMENT FOR OUR UNION MEMBERS BECAUSE THOSE ARE BACKED BY A GUARANTEED CORPORATION. FURTHER THE UNIVERSE TIME AND PLANTS ARE FUNDED AND ARE GUARANTEED BY THE THE COMMON PLAN BENEFITS ARE NOT GOLDEN PARACHUTES GOLDEN PARACHUTES ARE CLAUSES IN CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN KEY EXECUTIVES THAT ALLOW THEM TO RECEIVE LUCRATIVE BENEFITS IF THEY ARE TERMINATED. THIS PLAN CONSISTS OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT SIMILAR TO THE UNION PENSION PLANS WITH BENEFITS DETERMINED BY YEARS OF SERVICE. IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW OUR POSITION FINANCIAL INFORMATION WOULD BECOME PUBLIC VIOLATING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF PERSONAL PRIVACY THIS CLOSING THIS THANK YOU. EVEN IN ANGER GET GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES SORRY THIS IS -- CRISTINA LOCKWOOD COUNSEL WITH KAISER PERMANENTE HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ON THE SIMPLE BILL. BUT EVERY COME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR BRAND IN MARCH YOU AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I WE WERE GREATLY OPPOSE THE BILL -- HALF FOR THE REASONS STATED IN OUR LETTER THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND DAVID IS ALSO AMERICA'S VISION GROUPS ALSO IN OPPOSITION -- WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE POSITION BUT WILL SIT DOWN WITH THE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. BRINGING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I WOULD LIKE -- TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE ISSUES ONE IS THAT AS ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS. WE HAVE TAKEN THE INFORMATION SO THAT IT CANNOT IDENTIFY. ANY INDIVIDUALS -- IT TAKES BY VIRTUE OF COMPENSATION LEVEL SO THAT PRICE THINK TAT DEALS WITH THE PRIVACY ISSUE. OUR AND APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THAT. AMENDMENT. ENNIS I UNDERSTAND THE BILL IT APPLIES EQUALLY TO ANY NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE ENTITY WHICH OF WITCHER SEVERAL IN THE STATE NOW TO THE EXTENT THAT KAISER. PERMANENTE IS THE ONLY NONPROFIT HEALTH ORGANIZATION CARING DEERRED COMPENSATION OF A FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION ON ITS FINANCIALS WILL THEN. THIS BILL MAY ONLY APPLY TO THEM BUT IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED TO ADD ONE SINGLE COMPANY IT IS -- DIRECTED TO ADD A PLAN AND APPROACH TO DEALING WITH COMPENSATION BETWEEN AND NOT FOR PROFIT AND THE FOR PROFIT ARMS. THE ART AND THE ALLEGATION I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT IS THAT. THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO HIDE. THAT COMPENSATION IN AN ENTITY WHICH IS OTHERWISE NOT REQUIRED TO REVEAL ITS ITS INFORMATION SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL TRIES TO DEAL WITH. AND I THINK IT DOES -- AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORED TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS OF FOR A DAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL -- WITH THAT IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER MORNING. I THINK A QUESTION FIRST FOR YOU MADAM CHAIR OR COMMITTEE STAFF. SO THE AMENDMENT THAT PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY. AND GROUPS [inaudible] THESE [inaudible] LEVELS OF OF COMPENSATION. DOES IT PROVIDE ANY -- CATEGORY OF EMPLOYMENT EXECUTIVE PHYSICIAN. SO THERE IT WOULD BE SILENT AS TO IN THE JOB CATEGORY. THAT IS CORRECT IT DOESN'T SIMPLY BY A DOLLAR AMOUNT. WELL THEN ACROSS THROUGH THE CHAIR PLAYSTATION. FOR THE PROPONENTS. IS THAT ACHIEVE THE TRANSPARENCY THAT YOU THINK. SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. TO WELL LOOK I MA'AM MANAGER PLEASE. LOOK I TRUST THE WISDOM OF THE COMMITTEE TO IT TO HELP US. TO PROVIDE A BILL THAT DOESN'T -- CROSSOVER UP PRIVACY ISSUES AND WE TAKE THOSE VERY SERIOUS IN A PERFECT WORLD I'D WANT THAT INFORMATION -- BUT BECAUSE WE AGREE -- TO TO PROTECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S PRIVACY -- Là MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS DO SO. BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED ITS LEAD TO A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO ONE MILLION THOSE WOULD BE CATEGORIES. AND AFTER THAT IT BECOMES A ONE MILLION TO ONE MILLION AND A HALF TO TWO MILLION TO TWO MILLION A HALF. UNTIL WE REACH -- POTENTIALLY UP TO FIFTEEN MILLION IN TERMS OF WAGES AND WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY ASKING NOW THAT THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS. CAN WE HAVE ON THE NONPROFIT SIDE. AGGREGATE NUMBERS WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES ABOUT WHAT THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION IS US I DON'T THINK IT BREACHES ANY PRIVACY -- ISSUES AND AND LET ME ALSO BE CLEAR. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SEEN IT'S ILLEGAL. WE'RE NOT SAYING DON'T DO IT. WE'RE JUST SAYING IF YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE NONPROFIT STATUS -- AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO REAP THOSE BENEFITS. ARE IN IF YOU'RE GOING TO REPORT ON YOUR OWN OFFICERS ON YOUR OWN KEY EMPLOYEES ON YOUR OWN EXECUTIVES IS A NONPROFIT. THEN I THINK WE AS A PUBLIC HAVE A RIGHT ALSO -- NO -- IN THESE AGGREGATE NUMBERS. HOW YOU ARE -- SUBSIDIZING DEFERRED ON COMPENSATION. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THRUST OF MY QUESTION I'M SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL. I KNOW THAT. I KNOW THAT. JUST HAVING [inaudible] AGGREGATED. STAGES OF COMPENSATION -- WITHOUT KNOWING IS THAT GOING TO PHYSICIANS EXECUTIVE. SIX I THINK A IT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE I'VE DONE SOME LEGISLATION TRYING TO GET TO SPECIFIC CATEGORIES TO DETERMINE. IT GENDER SEGREGATION AND SO FORTH THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE I THINK IS NOT THE GOAL OF THE DESIGN OF THIS BILL. IT'S REALLY TO GET TO WHY IS THERE ALL THIS DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND I GET THE OTHER COMPONENT IS. GOING FROM A NON PROFITS REVENUES. TO FOR PROFIT. ENTITIES OR INDIVIDUALS THANK YOU. BY TO GET APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING A TORY. TO GET LATE WERE ALL GETTING A LITTLE GOOFY -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IS OUR MOTION. ALL RIGHT MOVE BY CENTER MINING -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO BRIEFLY CLOSE. I'M INTERESTED TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE VERY GOOD.

FORTY SEVEN AB THIRTEEN SIXTY GOOD EVENING THANK YOU GOOD EVENING -- FOR SOME JUST THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HELP ON OUR BILL. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. FOR A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY THOUGHT WHICH IS SOME BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR GROCERY DELIVERY THROUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS. WHAT THE DELIVERY PERSON HAS TO HAVE A FOOD SAFETY TRAINING FOR FOOD TO SPOIL EASILY? LIKE MEAT AND DAIRY. THE DELIVERY VEHICLE NEEDS TO MEET VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS OF HAVE LIABILITY INSURANCE. ALSO WE IMPOSED BY DOING RESPONSE TO ITS IN THE GROCERY STORE IN THE ONLINE PLATFORM FOR FOOD DELIVERY. AND PERMIT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ENFORCE THE BILL AND DOPT. REGULATIONS WITH THAT WE HAVE A WITNESS -- MISTER TRICKLE FROM YOUR SEAT AT THE WE THANK YOU OF WITNESS HORSEPLAY IT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CENTERS ON NUMBER OF TRICK ON THE AFTER UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS SPONSOR THE BILL. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD -- TO THE DOCTOR'S COMMENTS. IS THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REGULATION OR STATUTE THAT COVERS THE DELIVERY BY THIRD PARTY COMPANIES. THIS BILL FOR SIX TO FILL THAT GAP AND IT'S IT'S A CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM LEVEL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COME ON DOWN. TWO MINUTES EACH GOOD EVENING. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CORPS IN JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF TECH MATT IN OPPOSITION -- WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THIS BILL IS -- ABSOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND -- TRAINING WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD DELIVERY AND THE SAFE DELIVERY OF FOOD -- AND WHAT THOSE ODD TRAINING MODULES COULD LOOK LIKE OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ALREADY PROVIDE -- APPROPRIATE TRAINING MODULES FOR THIS TYPE OF DELIVERY OF GROCERIES OF THIRD PARTY DELIVERY OF GROCERIES THERE'S TO SPECIFIC IT'S AT THE LATE HOUR OF JUST A NAME TO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WE HAVE. WON THE AMENDMENTS OF THE BILL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL AND NOW INCLUDE A MINIMUM LIABILITY INSURANCE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BILL AND TELL THIS COMMITTEE -- EIGHT REQUIRES A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF A MILLION DOLLARS -- WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE COMING OUT OF THE T. AND C. Là BUT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE AND AND THEY LOOK A LITTLE. CONFUSING AS DRAFTED CURRENTLY THE OTHER THING IT REQUIRES IS A NINETEEN POINT INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS -- WHICH WE UNDERSTAND MAY BE APPROPRIATE IN THE TNC CONTEXT WHEN THEY ARE -- DRIVING PASSENGERS BUT WHEN YOU'RE DELIVERING DORITOS THAT MAY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND UNLESS AND WE BELIEVE IT'S UNNECESSARY AND OVER BURDENSOME. AND FINALLY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABLE TO ASSESS A CIVIL PENALTY OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS EXCESSIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN. THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANY GUIDANCE OF HOW WE WOULD COMPLY WITH THIS NEW LAW. SO WE ARE RESPECTFULLY STILL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. AARON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION -- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES LEGISLATION -- ECHOING THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE HERE WE BELIEVE IT'S AS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM -- THE FACT REMAINS THAT YOU KNOW IF WE'RE HERE ABOUT -- SAFETY OF FOOD THAT IS ONE THING ENTIRELY AND AND I THINK WE'VE INDICATED THAT WE ARE ALL FOR THAT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO DO TO WORK TOWARDS THAT. THAT BEING SAID -- WE VIEW THIS AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO THESE COMPANIES THAT PARTNER -- THE WITH WITH -- NOT ACTUALLY PARTNER BUT UP PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE GROCERY COMPANIES THAT ARE A LOT OF CASES -- UNION SHOPS -- AND A LOT OF CASES PROVIDE. MORE BUSINESS THE SHOP SO -- WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT LEGISLATION THAT MAKES MORE DIFFICULT FOR THAT -- MIGHT HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF THIS BILL IN IN TERMS OF MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT -- FOR BRICK AND MORTAR GROCERS AT TO DO THEIR BUSINESS THESE UP THE APP PLATFORMS PROVIDE A NEW MEANS -- TO GET MORE CUSTOMERS INTO OUR VIRTUAL DOORS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER TEN A CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING. LESS CUSTOMERS INTO BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPS MOST LIKELY YOU HAVE SHE W. SHOPS AND DRIVE BUSINESSES TO OTHER PLACES THAT WILL HURT BOTH -- EMPLOYERS AND AND OUR EMPLOYEE PARTNERS AND FOR THAT REASONS AND AND OTHERS -- WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES MEASURE ASKING ABOUT THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION BUT I'M SURE BENEFIT COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. KEVIN KELLY WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. IN A FEW ON BEHALF A DOOR DASH IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OUR GLASS IN ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE LIABILITY FOR US THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] HARD OF BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR RUSSELL. A SENATOR WHY CASKEY HAVE A QUESTION -- IT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOD SAFETY WE HAVE ALL THESE DELIVERIES TO COME FROM RESTAURANTS THAT WOULDN'T BE COVERED BY THIS BILL WHAT'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN. GROCERY STORES AND RESTAURANTS THIRD I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION IF. YOU HAD THE LIVER IF ANY OF THE GROCERY STORES DID THESE DELIVERY. THEY WOULD HAVE ABOUT TEN TO TWENTY TIMES THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION. IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THE GROCERY STORE. AFTER BY BY ALL THE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT THEY A PIE BY WITHIN THE GROCERY STORE OUTSIDE THE GROCERY STORE. THIS PROVIDES A MODICUM OF CONSUMER SAFETY AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND TRIES TO ALSO CREATE IN EVEN THIS BETWEEN PLATFORMS THE THE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAPPILY TOOK IN THIS COMMITTEE. REALLY WAS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE WITH LIFT AND UBER SO AGAIN WHILE -- IN THE STENSON MENTIONED THE TNC MODEL WELL THE YOU KNOW THE MOST PROFITABLE PART OF THE UBER BUSINESS MODEL IS AN ACTUALLY. DRIVING YOU ARE ME IT'S ACTUALLY UBER EATS. SO AGAIN ON AS THEY IF THEY WERE TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN THIS PLOT FROM I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO BE CONSISTENT AMONG THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS. AND WE HAD WE WE SEE THIS IS A VERY -- SMALLER NOT A REGULATION SPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF REGULATION TO GROCERY STORES FACE I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THE THE MODIFICATION OF THE VEHICLE THAT'S REQUIRED. UNDER THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE. I WAS JUST USING WINDOWS LIVE SERVICES OVER THE WEEKEND ISSUES REGULAR TOYOTA. CORONA SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD. AFFECT THAT SERVICE IF THE IF THEY HAVE TO MAKE THESE. YOU KNOW MODIFICATIONS. FOR SAFETY. SO THE THE PREVIOUS VERSION IF I'M A MANAGER PLEASE -- THE PREVIOUS THE FIRST VERSION OF THE BILL. I WANTED TO WE TRIED TO MIRROR EXACTLY WHAT WHAT GROCERY STORES HAVE TO DO WITH DELIVERIES. IF A GROCERY STORE USE IT ON A PLACE TO DO IT BECAUSE HE'S DELIVERY STAFF HAVE A REFRIGERATED VEHICLE THAT WAS THE FIRST FOR THE BILL. THAT WAS THE OPPOSITION RAISED AS A CONCERN. THE DRIVERS DON'T HAVE REFRIGERATED VEHICLES OBVIOUSLY IN THE FLOOD FROM SO WE REMOVE THAT. AND WE WONDER BRING CONSISTENCY IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE ITSELF OF THE VEHICLE IT'S NOT A MODIFICATION IT'S A VEHICLE INSPECTION. WHICH MEMBERS THE VEHICLE INSPECTION USED FOR UBER LIFT TO MAKE SURE THE VEHICLE SAFE THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE PER SE. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE COMMITTEE IS FOR REQUESTED WHICH DOCTORS ACCEPTED IN THE SPONSORED ACCEPTED FLAT JUST TO CLARIFY THAT. ARE YOU DONE WITH QUESTIONS YES THE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I DIDN'T REALLY I DIDN'T HAVE THIS BILL ON MY RADAR COMING IN IT IT. SEEMS IT PUSHED IT PUSH THE ENVELOPE A BIT BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENT ADDED ON THIS LIABILITY ISSUE SO. I CERTAINLY OPEN VOTING FOR ON THE FLOORS WANTED TO RAISE THAT AND HOLD ON HOLDING OFF TODAY BUT WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT I JUST. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT FIND SOME DUPLICATION UNNECESSARILY WHERE YOU'VE GOT ALREADY IF YOU'RE TAKING PASSENGERS ON GET THE INSURANCE POLICY BUT IF THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS ON BOARD AND JUST GROCERIES ON BOARD OWNERS UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D HAVE A SIMILAR LIABILITY POSSIBLE LET ME DIGEST A LITTLE FURTHER AND VISIT. BEFORE THE FORCE OF THANKS. THANK YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT JUST TO RESPOND TO THAT THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY IS PART OF A CHILD WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH YEARS. THE DRIVERS OF SIMILAR TO RELIVE DRIVERS ARE TREATED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND OF IN THE DELIVERY OF FOOD OR PASSENGERS IS DRIVER. SO WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE DRIVERS -- TRYING TO EMULATE AS MANY REGULATIONS AND LAWS THAT APPLY TO EMPLOYEES TO THESE DRIVERS IN THIS IS THE REASON WHY. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE AMENDMENT TO ADD THE LIABILITY INSURANCE OTHERWISE. THE DRIVER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE WHEN THEY'RE IN THE COURSE OF DELIVERING FOR THE PLOT FROM COMPANIES THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE DRIVERS UNDER. DYNAMICS ARE IN FACT EMPLOYEES AND THIS IS PART OF NINE OUT OF TEN WE GET TO TOMORROW I DON'T WANNA GET TO DYNAMIX TONIGHT THANK YOU -- BUT WE KNOW DRIVERS CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS REGARDLESS IF THEY HAVE PASSENGERS AND THAT'S I THINK THE THE GIST OF THAT. ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOTION BY CENTER MORNING. ALL I'M SO SORRY SENATOR ALSO HAS ALREADY MOVE THE BILL -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AGAIN. SHE THE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEES HELPED US RESPECT FRANCE RIGHT. THANK YOU FIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER FORTY SEVEN A. B.

RECESSIONS GOING I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT FAR OFF THE THE TRACK. ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RUBIO I THINK YOU ARE NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO RIP TO PRESENTED AN A. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN AN ACT RELATING TO THE ADVERTISING OF AN LICENSE CAMPUS BUSINESSES. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY FORMALLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN COMMENTS TWO ONE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. THE AMENDMENTS AGREED TO IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE STRIKE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FROM THE BILL AND CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES. FOR THAT ENFORCEMENT CAN BE FOCUSED ON BAD ACTORS AND IT IS NOT USED TO HARSHLY PUNISH HONEST MISTAKES. AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN ISSUING LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR FOR THE KIND OF ITS BUSINESS TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. DESPITE SOME SUCCESSES DURING THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF LEGAL CELLS THE BLACK MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH DRIVING DOWN LEGAL SALES. RESEARCH AND STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT AS MUCH AS 80% OF THE CAMERAS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA IS DONE VIA THE UNDERGROUND MARKET. IN ADDITION TO DWINDLING TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET PRESENTS SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS DOES NOT MEET ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARDS AND EVADES THE STATE TESTING. COMBINING THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A KEY POLICY GOAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AS WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR THIS BILL HERE TODAY WILL TARGET THE BLACK MARKET BY CRACKING DOWN ON A SPECIFIC PROBLEM THE ADVERTISING OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. CERTAIN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICE OF ADVERTISING ILLEGAL OPERATIONS FOR PROFIT. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WILL CREATE SEVERAL POUND THE PENALTIES FOR ENTITIES WOULD DECIDE TO ADVERTISE THE LEGAL OPERATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROFIT. AS A LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT SAY THAT WE ARE TAKING THE CANNABIS UNDERGROUND MARKET SERIOUSLY IF WE ALLOW THE END REULATED PROMOTION AN ADVERTISEMENT OF THE LEGAL. BUSINESSES TO EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE WE KNOW THAT THESE ADVERTISEMENTS DRIVE BUSINESS TOWARDS ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AND MUST FIND A WAY TO RESTRICT THIS PRACTICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY AND WITH ME HERE TODAY I HAVE THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL MARVIN PINEDA ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. AND ALABAMA THOUGHT TO RECALL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. THE COMMENTER OVER TO RECALL ME OFF THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS WESTERN STATES COUNCIL. ON YOU IF YOU DOUBLES BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY FROM HELL TO HER CALIFORNIA. ONE OF OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS INDUSTRY CRATES GOOD PAYING JOBS. LETTERS TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. WHAT'S UNDER CUTTING THAT EFFORT IS THE LIST OF MARKET PLACE. WHEN A COMPANY GETS INTO THE GETS IN THE CANISTERS BUSINESS AND THEY DON'T HAVE A LICENSE THEY DON'T GO THROUGH THE TESTING PROCEDURES? THEY DON'T PAID OF REQUIRED WAGES IT DEPRESSES THE MARKETPLACE AND LOWER THE WAGES AS A RESULT. THIS BILL IS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO BRING GREATER ENFORCEMENT. AND TO SERVE WITHOUT WITHOUT THE JUST THE THE BAD ACTORS OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LEVEL. IT WAS A TERRIBLE PUN THANK.

HELLO MINISTER CALLING THE PRESIDENT A CAN AS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION PROP SIXTY FOUR IS PASSED TO REGULATE MEDICAL AN ADULT USE CANNABIS. AND THE OVERSIGHT OF NECESSARY ENFORCEMENT TOOLS FOR NINE LICENSE HOLDERS HAVE LEFT A THRIVING ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET THE ABILITY TO FLOURISH UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF ONLINE ADVERTISING PLATFORMS. LIKE WE'D MAPS THEIR CONTACT THEIR CONNECTING AND FACILITATING THE SALE OF ILLEGALLY GROWN AND MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS THAT CONSUMERS -- CAN GET THREE LEGAL RETAILERS AND DELIVERY BUSINESSES THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS TWO THOUSAND ADVERTISE RETAIL LOCATIONS ON THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO OF THOSE LOCATIONS ARE LEGAL OVERWHELMINGLY THE CONSUMERS ARE CONFUSED WITH DECEPTIVE ADVERTISEMENTS. THAT ARE DESIGNED TO STRIP AWAY THE MARKERS THAT DIFFERENTIATE A LEGAL AND ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESS THIS IS THE DELIBERATE IGNORANCE OF WHO YOUR ADVERTISING FOR AND IS A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS BILL'S NECESSITY -- IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHITE THE LEGAL BUSINESSES SATURATE THE MARKET MORE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS ARE FOLLOWING THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODEL A SUPPORTING THESE ILLEGAL BUSINESS IF. THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF MAKING ENFORCEMENT AND TAX COLLECTION NEAR IMPOSSIBLE OR JUST TOO EXPENSIVE FOR LEGAL MUNICIPALITIES. LOTS OF RESTRICTED THIS KIND OF ADVERTISING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BEFORE AN OWNER'S A BACK PAGE DOT COM A SERVE JAIL TIME FOR THEIR AIDING AND ABETTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY SO THIS IS NOT A PRECEDENT SETTING CASE. NOW THE TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TAKE CONTROL THE LARGEST CAKE COMMERCIAL CAM WITH MARKET IN THE WORLD AND GUIDE THE LEGAL MARKET TO A FACE AN EQUITY POSITION FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD EMULATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I GUESS THE LEGACY OF KINGS ON BEHALF OF EASE THANK YOU. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH IT [inaudible] THANK YOU.

GOOD EVENING BRANCH THE ROBERT HALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR GONZALEZ. IN HER MY STAR TESTIMONY JUST GETTING. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE AFTER MENTIONED COMPANY WE'D MAPS -- WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF ON LICENSE ENTITIES ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET. INCLUDING ON SITES LIKE WE'D MAPS. BUT IT GOES BE MUCH BEYOND WE'D MAPS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET AFTER THAT GOES ACROSS ALL THE ADVERTISING PLATFORMS ON THE INTERNET. ANYBODY HERE NOW IF YOU WANT TO PULL OUT YOUR PHONE AND YELP. CANNABIS DISPENSARIES IN SACRAMENTO I DARE YOU TO FIND THE LICENSE NUMBER ON ANY ONE OF THOSE ADVERTISEMENTS. GO TO GOOGLE GO TO YA WHO GO TO BANG GO TO CRAIG'S LIST DO THE SAME. THE BILL IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO NOT APPLIED A INTERNET PLATFORMS BUT TO APPLY THE WEED MAPS ONLY WE ARE ONE COG IN THIS. PLATFORM ARENA -- IN FACT WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE SMALLEST CARDS ALTHOUGH WE ARE. CANNABIS SPECIFIC. I THINK MOST PEOPLE GO RIGHT TO THEIR SEARCH ENGINE TO START IF THEY'RE GOING TO START A SEARCH. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRESS. PRESIDENT SETTING THAT IN IT WAS IT WAS A REFERENCE TO BACK PAGE CONGRESS ACTUALLY CHANGE THE LAW. AS A RESULT OF THE ADVERTISING THAT WAS TAKING ON TAKING PLACE ON BACK PAGE. TO EXPLICITLY CARVE OUT PROSTITUTION SEX TRAFFICKING. THEY SPECIFICALLY DID THAT TO EXEMPT OUT TO INCLUDE. EXEMPTS THEM OUT OF TWO THIRTY AND DENY THEM THE PROTECTIONS THAT SECTION TWO THIRTY THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT PROVIDES. EVEN SO ASSUMING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT TO SECTION TWO THIRTY DID NOT APPLY AND THERE WASN'T A PREEMPTION. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HURDLES TO COMPLIANCE WE'D MAPS ADVERTISERS CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED THREE DIFFERENT TIMES TO ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THEY DO HAVE A LICENSE THEY ARE REQUIRED. TO FILE FILL A LICENSE NUMBER IN. WE DO NOT VERIFY EVERY LICENSE NUMBER NOR COULD WE IF WE WANTED. TO THERE ARE MANY ISSUES WITH THE FEAR OF CANNABIS CONTROLS WEBSITES SUCH AS DOING BUSINESS NAMES DOING BUSINESS AS NAMES ARE NOT NECESSARILY LISTED. SO GEORGE MILLER COULD HAVE AN A LICENSE NUMBER BUT IT WOULD NOT SHOW UP IS. HIGH TIMES DISPENSARY SO OR NOR ARE THE ADDRESSES NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT OF OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS JIM YOU WERE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED. ON THE WEBSITE OPERATORS -- FOR LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WE THINK WE'RE CLOSE TO GETTING AN AMENDMENT THAT ADDRESSES ARE CONCERNED. BUT WE ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT THAT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS WERE IN JENSEN ON BEHALF TECH THAT -- ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LIABILITY ON THE ADVERTISING PLATFORM AND THINK THAT THE BURDENS OF THIS BILL ARE MORE -- APPROPRIATELY PLACED ON THE ADVERTISERS THEMSELVES THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OR BRING IT BACK TO THE DIET SO THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR GONZALEZ [inaudible] SENATOR MONNING. I'D JUST LIKE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS MAYBE IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT THEY RAISE SOME. I THINK LEGITIMATE CONCERNS JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO MISTER MILLER'S CONCERNS SO ARE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING -- TO INCLUDE OTHER PLATFORMS AND IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE THE CHAIR OF THE MP -- INCLUDED OGHAM TECHNIC NOW THOSE FOLKS SO WHEN THEY WERE INCLUDED WE WORKED WITH -- GOING TECHNIQUE AND THE OTHER -- PLATFORMS AND WE REMOVE THE OPPOSITION THEY STILL HAVE CONCERNS BUT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN TERMS OF MISTER MILLER -- WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- HOW THE WORD TO TO VERIFY AND? THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS SO NEW THAT EVEN -- TRYING TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION. THEY CLAIM IT'S NOT EASY BUT IF YOU HAVE -- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN YOUR PLATFORMS I AM SURE THAT YOU CAN DEDICATE SOMEBODY -- TO VERIFY THE LICENSES AND PART OF THE DISCUSSION WAS THAT WHEN YOU ADVERTISE -- YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PRESENT -- EITHER AN AD AND I ASKED THEM TO JUST INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL LINE TO PUT THE LICENSE NUMBER AND HE IS CORRECT NOT EVERYBODY DOES PUT THE LICENSE NUMBER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE INTENDING IS THAT. THEY DO AT LEAST DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE -- THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO FOR IN TERMS OF THE FINES IF IT'S THE FIRST TIME THERE'S WE'RE WORKING ON THAT A SOLUTION SO THAT THEY DON'T GET FIND THE FIRST TIME BUT THE SECOND AND THAT AND ANY SUBSEQUENT TIMES. THEY WILL BE FINED AND SO FOR ME -- AND I THINK FOR FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THE E. LEGAL SHOPS THAT ARE BEING ADVERTISED AND SO. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST THE ONLINE PLATFORMS ARE COMPLYING WITH THE WITH THE REQUEST. ADDITION IT DOES SOUND. THAT RIGHT TO CURE THE FIRST NOTICE OF VIOLATION YES YET TIME TO REMEDY IT BEFORE THERE'S ANY PENALTY YES AND THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR STIRRED. VERY BRIEFLY THOUGH IT JUST. TO PUT A FINE POINT ON THAT SO. YOU'RE SAYING THE OPPOSITION SAYING THERE'S NO. NO ACTUAL LICENSE NUMBER THAT THEY COULD USE TO TRACK THAT. NOW THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT TRUE IN FACT LICENSES. LICENSE DISPENSARIES ARE ISSUED A LICENSE. THE THE COMPLICATING PAR IS ACTUALLY FINDING OUT ON THE BUREAU'S SITE WHO THE LICENSEE IS SO THEY ARE LICENSE SUSPENSIONS ARE ISSUED A LICENSE NUMBER. THEY ARE ASKED BY OUR WEBSITE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE ASKED BY THE OTHER WHETHER THEY'RE ASK MY YELP OR NOT TO POPULATE A FIELD WHERE THEY HAVE WITH. THE FOR OKAY THE E. FILL OUT THINGS WE HAVE TO PUT YOUR SOURCE CODE AND I'M RUNNERS NINE BOXES ARE YOU FILL OUT. YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ON OURS AS WELL IT'S NOT ABOUT DEDICATING SOMEBODY A WEED MAPS OR SOMEBODY AT YELP OR SOMEBODY CRAIG'S LIST TO GO CHECK IT. IT'S A MATTER OF DEALING WITH THE BUREAU'S OFTENTIMES THIRTY DAYS OR MORE STILL ISSUE A LICENSE BUT IT MAY BE THIRTY DAYS BEFORE IT IS IT'S ON THE WEBSITE OR FOR LICENSES REVOKED HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE BEFORE IT COMES DOWN OFF THE WEBSITE. WHEN YOU ISSUE A LICENSE TO GEORGE MILLER BUT GEORGE MILLER'S ACTUALLY DOING BUSINESS AS? YOU KNOW HIGH TIMES DISPENSARY. AND I GO TO GO TO THE BUREAU'S WEBSITE LOOK OF HIGH TIMES DISPENSARY AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING AND I PULL THEM DOWN BECAUSE ARE NOT LICENSED AND THEN I FIND OUT NOW. GEORGE MILLER HAS GOT THE LICENSE ACTUALLY HAS IT THAT THE BUREAU JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE DBA. SO LET'S HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RAT AND MISSED MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND JUST WANT TO START OFF WITH THIS PREMISE PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS TRAPPED IN WHEN SPUR OF THE BILL. I FORGOT TO MENTION IS THE UNITED MEDICAL MARIJUANA COALITION FROM SAN DIEGO AT THE LONG BEACH COLLECTIVE ASSOCIATION THE COLLECTIVE VALLEY CAM JUST COULD YOU ANSWER COULD YOU RESPONSIBILITY MIGHT MIGHT MY ANSWER TO THAT TO THAT IS THAT THERE ARE. ONLINE PLATFORMS THERE EVEN PRESENT HERE IN THE ROOM THAT OUR ADVERTISING ONLY FOR ILLEGAL SHOPS THERE IS A WAY TO VERIFY THAT ONLY AT THE BUREAU OF CANADA'S CONTROL BUT IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS LICENSE NUMBER. SO THAT ARE YOU MAN IT'S HOW IT SO YOU COULD JUST CALL. THE DEPARTMENT IN THEIR FIGHT THE LICENSE NUMBER FOR EACH FOR EACH AT ODD ODD DISPENSARY SO IT'S VERY EASY AND CLEAR THAT SPENT THAT THAT HAPPENED THAT COULD BE DONE AND IS DONE BY LEE FLEA. AND OTHER ONLINE PLATFORMS SO -- WE WE DISAGREE WITH MISTER MILLER AS A COULD BE DONE. WHAT WE HAVE IS -- OVER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ODD ILLEGAL DISPENSARIES BEING ADVERTISED ON THE APP ONLINE PLATFORMS AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT THIS ADDRESSES PROP SIXTY FOUR DID NOT CREATE ANY PENALTIES. FOR OUR LANDLORDS OR ONLINE PLATFORMS THAT ARE DOING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THERE ONLY ON LICENSEES SO THAT'S WHY WHEN THE BUREAU OF CANADA'S CONTROL ISSUE A SEASON THIS IS LETTER. LAST YEAR. ENTITIES LIKE WE MAP THAT OUT TO RESPOND BECAUSE THERE'S NO PENALTIES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU OUR ALL RIGHT THE SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- I WOULD JUST SIMPLY ASK YOU TRY TO WORK OUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT CENTER MONNING WAS. INDICATING. A CONCERN THAT. AGAIN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE STRICT LIABILITY WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME. CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE VERY VERY CLOSE TO THAT KIND OF RESOLUTION SO. LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR COMPLETING THAT. THE BILL I DO THINK THOUGH THAT DEALS WITH A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT THE ADVERTISING BY ON LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. CAN REALLY POSE A HEALTH RISK I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT. YOUR MOTHER'S CANNABIS AND YOUR MOTHER'S. ANYWAY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE CANNABIS OF THE THE OLD DAYS IF YOU WILL -- AND THAT THEY CAN BE LACED WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT -- WE CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE SAME TIME SO WITH THAT THERE'S A MOTION AND THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER FIFTY FOUR A. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ CONSOLES I JONES. JONES NO MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN. STERN I BURKE. NUMBER I Y. CASKEY. MY COUNTY I SEVEN ONE SEVEN TWO ONE SEVEN TO ONE THE BILL IS OUT WILL CLOSE ROLE THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD WORK ON THIS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF SIMPLY MEMBER OR WHEN YOU HAVE A SERIES OF BILLS UP. WE'LL START WITH -- FILE ITEM. SIXTEEN L. A. B.. FIVE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. FIVE TWO THREE THIS BILL IS IN RESPONSE TO TROUBLING INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM THAT UNCOVERED THE PRACTICE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES SELLING SENSITIVE A REAL TIME DATA LOCATION OF THEIR SUBSCRIBERS. THIS INFORMATION WAS AND PACKAGED AND RESOLD TO MIDDLEMAN. ANYBODY WILLING TO PAY USUALLY BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE OTHERS WITH AN INTEREST IN FINDING AND STOCKING INDIVIDUALS. THIS BILL WILL PROHIBIT A WIRELESS TELECOM PROVIDER OR ANY DIRECT INDIRECT AN AFFILIATE OF THE PROVIDER FROM DISCLOSING CELL SITE LOCATION INFORMATION TO ANY PARTY. WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING THE SUBSCRIBERS EXPRESS CONSENT THE BILL ALSO CONTAINS EXEMPTIONS FOR NINE ONE ONE PURPOSES SO PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS CAN LOCATE CALLERS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW THIS SAME LOCATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT -- IN NON EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WITH A SEARCH WARRANT. IT'S AVERY IMPORTANT PROTECTION DUE TO THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF YOUR LOCATION WITH AB FIVE TWO THREE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR REALTIME LOCATION AND DATA. PROTECTED AND OUT OF THE HANDS OF STRANGERS. THANK YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK CORRIVEAU THANK YOU OTHER ANY WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. I GUESS NOT -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IT'S STEP FORWARD PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLTON PROCEED TI A WHERE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR FOR THE BETTER PART OF THIS YEAR -- AND WE WERE CLOSE AND I THINK OUR CLOSE. TO IT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT -- CELL SITE LOCATION INFORMATION SHOULD BE OPT IN -- UNFORTUNATELY -- THE WAY THESE AMENDMENTS HAVE HAVE. HAVE THE EVOLVED. HAS CREATED AN UNWORKABLE SITUATION LIKE TO EXPLAIN FIRST CONTEXT. THE IFORMATION THAT WAS. THAT WAS USED WAS PROVIDED TO A THIRD PARTY AGGREGATOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF THINGS LIKE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND FIRST ALERT -- IT WAS AN EASIER WAY FOR ALL THE CARRIERS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO ONE ENTITY. THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT NOR AUTHORIZE THE ENTITY TO SELL IT TO ANYBODY OTHER THAN. THOSE THAT THEY HAD CONTRACTED THEM TO DO. ONCE THEY DETERMINED THAT TO BE THE CASE THEY STOPPED THE PRACTICE SO IT IS NOT GOING ON NOW SO. IN EFFECT -- THE THE THE GOAL OF OF OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUNS BILL HAS BEEN HAS BEEN ACHIEVED -- BUT ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION FOR WIRELESS COMPANIES -- I THINK IS FOLKS KNOW. MANY OTHER ENTITIES HAVE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION OFTEN WITH MUCH MORE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. CONNECTED TO IT. AND THEY ARE NOT COVERED NOR TREATED -- BY THIS BILL -- FURTHER MORE -- IT'S TECHNICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR A KERRY TO PREVENT A SELL SIDE FROM TRANSMITTING INFORMATION TO A THIRD PARTY THEY PAYING ALL THE TIME. AND THERE ARE THIRD PARTY GROUPS THAT HAVE THIRD PARTY SOURCES THAT HAVE PRECISE LOCATION OF CELL SITES SO. IN EFFECT THERE'S NO WAY. WE CAN ASK FOR CONSENT WHEN IT'S IT IS AN AUTOMATIC. WE KNOW SENDING OUT OF THE SIGNAL -- WE CAN WORK ON THAT BUT THAT IS A REALLY CONCERNED AND THESE ARE THESE ARE RELATIVELY NEW AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THIS IS AN OPT IN I WISH WE HAD MORE THEM WHEN IT COMES. TO PROTECTING OUR INFORMATION BUT THIS CLEARLY. OF REQUIRES AN OPT IN TO PROVIDE TO EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT. THAT INFORMATION TO BE -- AVAILABLE. AND YOU CAN OPT OUT ANYTIME YOU WISH. OF ALL OF THIS HAS TO BE DISCLOSED TO THE CONSUMER ANOTHER GOOD ITEM. SECONDLY OF FOR MY FRIENDS FROM THE CHAMBER AND SHE JACKET ALSO PROVIDES FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AGAINST THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES FOR DELIBERATE DELIBERATE VIOLATION SO IT ACTUALLY PUT SOME TEETH INTO THIS. OF REQUIREMENT AND CERTAINLY GIVES. MEANING TO OUR RIGHTS AND PUTS BAD ACTORS ON NOTICE THAT THEY WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. THE NOTION THAT IT'S RISKS REGARDING WIRELESS ONLY PERHAPS THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND GOING FORWARD WE CAN HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS. FOR OTHER. ENTITIES AND CERTAINLY OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AT WORK FOR THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. HAS BEEN RELATIVELY FREE TO DO WHAT IT WANTS AND THERE REALLY BEEN NO WAITED OR KNOW. A CONTAINMENT OF IT SO I THINK THIS BILL DOES SAD AND I APPRECIATE. TO OF THE THE VARIOUS CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. PUT INTO THIS BILL AND I THINK IT'S NARROWLY CRAFTED TO ADDRESS AT THE VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM OF SELLING OURSELVES CELL. SITE LOCATION INFORMATION HIS TO MUCH SELLING GOING ON OF OUR INFORMATION AND THIS. COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS. OF WHO CAN BE TRACED AT ANY MOMENT BY AN ABUSER AND A VARIETY OF AREAS WHERE. NOT ONLY IS OUR INFORMATION BEING TAKEN BUT OUR LOCATION. I THINK HE'S A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT SO. I SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT AND DID. THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATOR RUSSELL ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT. MADAM SECRETARY OF THE MOTION OF THE IS -- DO PASS. THE SENATE APPROACH WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I I JUST APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE DID -- TO PUT THIS LANGUAGE TOGETHER AND AND IT HAS BEEN VERY DISTURBING TO READ THE STORIES IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. SIX MONTHS AGO AND THEN -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAD IT ALL THE TELECONFERENCE YOU SAID THEY STOPPED THIS PRACTICE AND THEN YOU HERE FOR A FEW MONTHS LATER THAT IT'S STILL GOING ON SO -- WE DO WANT THIS TO STOP AS I SAID IT THIS IS THE MOST EXTREMELY SENSITIVE INFORMATION WHEN YOU CAN TRACK PEOPLE LIVE AND ESPECIALLY. WORRISOME FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN A. B. FOR FIVE TWO THREE THE MOTIONS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS. JACKSON JACKSON AYE BORDERS TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I A JONES [inaudible] MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. STERN HI -- BURKE. NUMBER I WOULD CAL SKI. I KELSEY BY. SEVEN ZERO SEVEN TWO ZERO ALL MEMBERS ARE HERE IT'S SO THAT BILL IS SO CLOSE THE ROLE. AND MOVE ON NOW TO OF FILE ITEM. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU -- THE NEXT BILL I AM PROTECT RESENTING IS -- AB. EIGHT SEVEN THREE THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO BILLS THAT I'M OFFERING THI YEAR AS A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE WORK BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TO BRING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TOGETHER. AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPLEMENT CCPA AND I AS AS YOU AS YOU BEGIN THEN I WE'VE OFFERED OR ASKED TO TO ACCEPT CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSE ARE YOU AGREEING TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS I'M NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT. OF FIVE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIR PUTTING -- EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. OF AS THE THE SECOND OF THE TWO BILLS THE CHAMBER WORK DILIGENTLY VERY DIFFERENT BILL. HI YES -- THE CHAMBER WORK DILIGENTLY TO DISTILL THE NUMEROUS CONCERNS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY INTO A SHORT LIST OF CRITICAL ISSUES. THAT WOULD IMPEDE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH THEIR NEW RIGHTS PROMISE BUT TO THEM BY CCPA. CCPA PASS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROESS IN JUST ONE WEEK DUE TO THE IMPENDING DEADLINE TO REMOVE AN INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT IN THE THREAT OF A LIMITED FUTURE ABILITY TO LEGISLATIVELY UPDATE THE INITIATIVES PROPOSED PILOT POLICY RIGHTS. THERE WAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND THE RESULT IS A LOT THAT CAN BE CONFUSING. AND PRESENTS SOME SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR BOTH BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. MANY OF US LEGISLATORS LAMENTED THE NECESSITY A NECESSITY OF OF THE PROCESS BUT IT WAS FLAWED. AND WE WERE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THOSE WHO HAD OPERATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT CCPA BEFORE ITS EFFECTIVE DATE. THIS BILL TAKES ON TWO OF THOSE CONCERNS TO THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. WHICH I'M HAPPY THAT THE CHAIR AND I AGREE ON AND THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED WE WORKED EARLY ON WITH ALISTAIR MAKE THAGARD AND HIS GROUP CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY. TO MAKE SURE THE BILL WAS MAKING THE INTENT OF CCPA OPERATIONAL. IN THE ASSEMBLY WE TOOK ALL OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS BRINGING HIS GROUP TO A NEUTRAL STANCE AND THE EMAIL IS PASSED AROUND THAT -- THAT SHOWS THAT. WELL I WILL LET MY WITNESSES GET INTO THE WORKING DETAILS OF THE BILL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE TWO THRESHOLD CONSIDERATIONS. AND MAKES THE CPA IMPLEMENTATION MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WORKABLE. IT IS KEY THAT THE CCPA IS WORKABLE BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE THE MODEL FOR ALL STATES TO ADOPT AVOIDING CALLS FOR FEDERAL PREEMPTION. THAT UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKELY BE FAR WEAKER. BUT WE MUST EXPORT TO OUR SISTER STATES A WORKING MODEL NOT ONE THAT IS OVER BROAD AND HAS AND TO DEFINITIONS. THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO FIX AS MANY IMPORTANT TYPES OF CONSUMER RESEARCH ARE CONDUCTED WITH DE IDENTIFIED DATA. WE RECEIVED A LETTER THIS MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON I SHOULD SAY SUPPORTING OUR DE IDENTIFIED DEFINITION FROM JOHN LEAVE AWAITS THE CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. DURING OBAMA'S FIRST TERM HE OVERSAW THE FTC'S LANDMARK TWENTY TWELVE OF PRIVACY REPORT AND THAT EACH OF YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT. LETTER AND PART OF IT STATES I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES DE IDENTIFIED. DATA AS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW. MY BELIEF IS THAT AB EIGHT SEVEN THREE CONTAINS A STRONG STANDARD FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND HE AND HE ENDS WITH THEREFORE. A IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE APPROACH A PROPOSED BY AB EIGHT SEVEN THREE IS WELL SUITED TO PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY. I BELIEVE IT OFFERS THE RIGHT LEGISLATIVE PATH. FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND AGAIN THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED -- PASSED OUT TO YOU. AND I'M PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY HAVE BOTH SERRA BOOT FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND JUMP JIM HELP HEARD FROM THE DLA PIPER OR FROM DLA PIPER WARY AS A PARTNER AND CO CHAIR. OF THEIR GLOBAL DATA PROTECTION PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICE THANK YOU. OF WHO WANTS TO START. A PLEASE OKAY. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SERIBU WITH CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWED IN THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND IT REFLECTS A COMPROMISE PROPOSED BY CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY A GROUP FUND FOUNDED BY ALISTAIR TAGGART. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE OTHER SERIOUS CONCERNS WE WISH TO ADDRESS WITH THIS BILL INCLUDING THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS BEING ABLE. TO ACCESS ANY INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD. AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS NOW BOIL DOWN TO JUST TWO FIXES FIRST ADDING THE WORD REASONABLY IN FRONT OF CAPABLE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. TO THIS LANGUAGE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD IN THEORY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOMEONE. THIS IS NOT WORKABLE OUR PREFERENCE WAS TO REMOVE CAPABLE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH FROM THE LAW. TO COMPROMISE WE KEPT IT NEARLY ADDED A REASONABLENESS STANDARD WHICH WILL AT LEAST ADDRESS OUR MOST EXTREME CONCERNS AND WHICH MATCHES THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN THE LAW FOR LYNN COUPLE DATA. SECOND AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE FIXES THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA. THE AUTHORS OF THE CCPA INTENDED A TRUE EXEMPTION FOR DE IDENTIFIED DATA BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE DE IDENTIFIED IT IS A PRO PRIVACY PRACTICE TO INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN THEIR RESOURCES TO DE IDENTIFY THEIR DATA AND KEEP IT DE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE DE IDENTIFIED DATA IS FAR LESS VULNERABLE TO COMPROMISE AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA. UNFORTUNATELY THE CZ P. STATES THAT DE IDENTIFIED DATA MUST NOT RELATE TO OR BE CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON BUT THOSE THINGS ARE ALWAYS TRUE OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA AND THE TERM LOSES ALL MEANING IF IT'S NOT AMENDED. SO AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREES REVISED DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED WAS DRAWN FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FTC'S PRIVACY FRAMEWORK IT IS A WELL TESTED WIDELY ACCEPTED PRO PRIVACY APPROACH THAT REQUIRES KEEPING DATA DE IDENTIFIED. FURTHER AS PART OF OUR COMPROMISE EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE INCLUDES ROBUST REQUIREMENTS A BUSINESS MUST MEET FOR THEIR DE IDENTIFIED DATA TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXCEPTION. THAT ARE EVEN STRONGER THAN THE FTC APPROACH THIS BILL IS NECESSARY FOR BUSINESSES TO REALISTICALLY RACIALIZED THIS LAW IT STRENGTHENS THE CCPA IT IS PRO PRIVACY IT WILL MAKE CONSUMER SAFER. THANK YOU. WHICH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS JIM HALPERT AND I'M IN. PRIVATE PRACTICE ADVISING DOZENS OF CLIENTS ON PRACTICAL COMPLIANCE WITH CCPA. ONE OF THE AREAS THIS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IS THE NINE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA THAT BOTH. ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- OR NGUYEN AND SERVE -- JUST ADDRESSED IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY CIRCULAR AN EXTREMELY CONFUSING FOR ANY CONSUMER WHO WOULD READ THE LAW AND ALSO FOR BUSINESSES. AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WOULD FIX THIS THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD NOT. AND IF THIS IS REALLY A A CRITICAL ISSUE INSTEAD OF CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION DEAL AMENDMENTS WOULDN'T CREATE NARROW EXCEPTIONS ONLY TO THE ACCESS DELETION AND RIGHT TO KNOW RIGHTS. BUT NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CCPA DO NOT SELL REQUIREMENTS. THIS MAY SEEM SENSIBLE AT FIRST BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT ONCE A BUSINESS RECEIVED A DO NOT SELL REQUEST. THEY WOULD NEED TO PROACTIVELY RELAYING ALL DE IDENTIFIED DATA IN RESPONSE TO THAT REQUEST THIS IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER BY THE CURRENT LAW. AND WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE LINKING IN ASSOCIATING ALL DATA FOR THAT PURPOSE THIS WOULD MEAN. BRINGING MORE DATA TOGETHER CREATING SECURITY RISKS AND INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY TO USE THE DATA TO MONETIZE IT EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T SELLING IT. SO THE NET EFFECT IS NOT TO INCREASE PRIVACY THE AMENDMENTS ALSO -- DON'T ADDRESS OF THE AN ISSUE THAT DATE AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE DOES VERY WELL THEY DON'T INCENTIVIZE THE IDENTIFYING DATA THEY SIMPLY CREATE EXCEPTIONS TO HAVING TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS. UNDER AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IF THE DATA WERE EVER RE IDENTIFIED IT WOULD BECOME FULLY SUBJECT TO THE C. CPA AND ANY RECIPIENT WHO READ AND A FIGHT IT. WOULD NEED TO IMMEDIATE WOULD VIOLATE THE C. SPEAKS CITY PA LESS IT NOTIFIED EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHOSE DATA HAD BEEN RE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE IT WOULD BE COLLECTING INFORMATION IN NEED TO PROVIDE NOTICE.

HI GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR I'M ARTEFACTS JOHNSON WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA AS CO SPONSORS OF THE CCPA WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THIS YEAR WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LAW. INSTEAD ALL OF THE SURVIVING PRIVACY BILLS WERE NOW CONSIDERING OUR INDUSTRY REQUESTS FOR EXCEPTIONS. AS THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES A WE'VE WORKED WITH BILL AUTHORS WHO'VE BEEN SEEKING REASONABLE CLARIFICATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN GOOD FAITH. NONETHELESS OTHERS ARE TRYING TO WROTE THE LAW AND CUT BACK ON CONSUMERS RIGHT. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IT REPRESENTS AN EROSION. THIS BILL WOULD LIMIT WHAT IS PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW AND IT DOES NOT FALL THE FTC STANDARD WHICH MY COLLEAGUE JAKE WILL DISCUSS FURTHER. UNDER THE CCPA. COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO FREELY USE AND SHARE DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION INFORMATION THAT CANNOT REASONABLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMER. IT IS NOT PART OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN REQUEST ACCESS TO OR SAY DON'T SELL. AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IT LOWERS THE THRESHOLD OF WHAT QUALIFIES AS DE IDENTIFIED. UNDER THE AUTHOR'S OWN INTERPRETATION IT COULDN'T EXCLUDE IP ADDRESSES DEVICE IDENTIFIERS. BROWSER FINGERPRINTS AND WHAT A BROWSER FINGERPRINT IS IS BITS OF INNOCUOUS SEEMING INFORMATION LIKE YOUR SCREEN RESOLUTION YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM. AND YOUR DEVICE MODEL THAT TAKEN TOGETHER ARE USED TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY YOU AND YOUR DEVICE. THERE IS A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ABOUT THIS JUST LAST WEEK BECAUSE THIS IS HOW ADD TECH COMPANIES ARE TRACKING US UBIQUITOUSLY AND INVISIBLY ACROSS THE WEB. NOW THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE BLOCKING COOKIES IN OTHER WORDS THESE TRACKING TOOLS ARE USED BY COMPANIES TO ABATE AND AVOID PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES. AND IF THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM CCPA PROTECTIONS THEY WILL SIMILARLY BE USED BY COMPANIES TO IGNORE IT CONSUMERS DO NOT SELL PREFERENCE. THE IDENTIFICATION IS NOT PRIVACY PRODUCTIVE TECHNIQUE. IF DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION THAT CAN IDENTIFY YOU THIS IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT A LOT FOR THE PERVASIVE TRAFFIC YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD EVENING -- MY NAME IS JACOB SO I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES PROJECT ON I LIKE TO TAKE YOU TAKE THREE POINTS AWAY FROM MY TESTIMONY TODAY. FIRST ELECTRONIC IDENTIFIERS OR JUST A SENSITIVE AS REAL WORLD IDENTIFIERS LIKE NAME ADDRESS IS YOU GET SIMILAR PROTECTIONS AB. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE PRINCE TO TAKE THOSE AWAY. SECOND THE LAW MUST PROTECT AGAINST TECHNIQUES ALLOW SO CALLED ANONYMIZED INFORMATION TO BE RE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICE THOSE TECHNIQUES ARE POWERFUL TODAY. GET MORE SOPHISTICATED AND THIRD AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE DOES NOT REPLICATE. THE FTC STANDARD PROJECT ON VACATION. QUITE THE CONTRARY IS NARROWER. IS LESS CLEAR. AND IT IS. LESS PROTECTIVE THAN THE STANDARD LAID OUT IN THE FTC REPORT. IF THE COMMITTEE WISHES TO USE THE FTC STANDARD THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE CLOSER. THE POINT ONE WE PROTECT NAMES AND ADDRESSES EVEN THOUGH NAMES AND ADDRESSES DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REFER TO A SINGLE PERSON MORE THAN ONE PERSON CAN LIVE IN ADDRESS. I. P. ADDRESSES WOULD BE EXCLUDED ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR FROM THE DEFINITION. FROM FROM PERSONAL INFORMATION AND WOOD QUALIFIES DE IDENTIFIED UNDER AB. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE BUT I. P. ADDRESSES CAN BE USED AND ARE USED TO TRACK PEOPLE THE MOVE ACROSS THE INTERNET. THE SAME IS TRUE DEVICE IDENTIFIERS. PROBABLY ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM OR HOLDING A CELLULAR PHONE. AND THAT THE CELLULAR PHONE HAS A DEVICE ID ASSOCIATED WITH IT. BUT UNDER. EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE THAT DEVICE ID WOULD QUALIFY. AS DE IDENTIFIED IF YOU YOU CAN CONSIDER -- THE AUTHOR'S INTERPRETATION. THAT MOBILE PHONE IS ME MY MOBILE PHONE IS ME AND ANYTHING THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MY MOBILE PHONE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ME. PRIVACY MEANS PROTECTING THAT INFORMATION JUST AS YOU WOULD ANYTHING IT'S ABOUT ME. LOCATION INFORMATION IS SIMILAR AND I'LL REFER BACK TO THE NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE SHOWING TO DETERMINE YOUR TIME THAT AND LOOK ISN'T MAYES COMEDIAN ON LIES. AS FOR THE FTC STANDARD THANK YOU. YOUR TWO MINUTES FOR A PERHAPS WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS AND WILL BE ABLE. TO A FURTHER ELABORATE ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE [inaudible] YES. TRACY ROSENBERG FROM OPEN PRIVACY IN OPPOSITION THIS IS NOT A PRIVACY PROTECTIVE BILL THANK YOU. MORE IN HONEY OF CONSUMER REPORTS IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THE COURT ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE WILL WE WOULD HAVE REMOVED OPPOSITION WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL AND PRINT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS [inaudible] SO. I AM ALSO -- STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL HAD THE AUTHOR TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PROPOSED I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A GOOD BILL. BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THE CCP A IS AN UMBRELLA. AND PERSONAL INFORMATION IS WITHIN THAT UMBRELLA. DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION IS NOT IN THAT UMBRELLA. IF IT IS DE IDENTIFIED IT IS OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF THE CCPA THAT'S WHY ALL OF THESE BUSINESS GROUPS THE TECH GROUPS AND WHAT HAVE YOU HAVE COMMON IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE THE LESS PERSONAL INFORMATION THERE IS THE MORE OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR THEM TO TAKE THAT THE QUOTE UNQUOTE DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION. AND SELL IT. AND USE IT ANY WAY THEY WANT WITHOUT THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS OF THE CCPA WATER HOSE PROTECTIONS. THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING ACCUMULATED ABOUT YOU. THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO OPT OUT OF THAT. AND THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DELETE THAT INFORMATION. IF IT'S CALLED DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION WHICH THIS BILL WILL EXPAND AND TAKE. A LOT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE THAT UMBRELLA PROTECTION. WE DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FALL WITHIN THE CCPA PROTECTIONS. IS THAT A BASIC ANALYSIS A IS THAT A SORT OF A VERY SIMPLISTIC VIEW. NOT SIMPLISTIC IT'S CORRECT PARK WITH WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CHECK IS IN THE MAIL OKAY. SO TO PUT IT SIMPLY. WHEN A CONSUMERS INFORMATION IS CONSIDERED PERSONAL INFORMATION IT'S A FOR THOSE PROTECTIONS? IF IT'S DE IDENTIFY IF IT'S DETERMINED TO BE DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION IT HAS NO PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL TAKES AND TRIES TO EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED NOW INFORMATION AT ONE POINT COULD BE QUOTE ON QUOTE DE IDENTIFIED BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT WITH THE ALGORITHMS IN ALL OF THE SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION. OR TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE INDUSTRY THAT DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION THAT IS NOT PROTECTED THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT. CAN YOU CAN IN FACT BE RE IDENTIFIED I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE CORRECTTERM BUT WITH ALGORITHMS THEY CAN FIGURE OUT THE THATCH YOU. AND THEN YOU ARE REALLY UP. A CREEK WITHOUT A LADDER. IS NOW. BEING SENT OUT INTO WHO KNOWS WHERE WITH YOUR SPECIFIC. DATA AND PROFILE ON IT. AND THAT IS WHY I THINK THIS IS A A DANGEROUS BILL AGAIN THE C. C. P. A FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS A PRETTY WEAK KAPITI. BUT IT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND THOSE WHO WORKED HARD ON THE BILL LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR. THERE WERE IS A A COMMITMENT THAT WE WERE NOT OING TO DO ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE IT IF WE NEEDED TO CLARIFY WELL THEN WOULD CLARIFY BUT I KNOW I HAD A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT I THOUGHT. OF WHO HELPED WITH THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BUT DID NOT TOUCH THE THE JUST THE BONES OF THE CCPA ITSELF AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE MADE -- THE BILL BECOMES EFFECTIVE WHAT IS A JANUARY. A JANUARY FIRST -- IT WILL BE IT WILL BE A BILL THAT IS THE THE TEMPLATE FOR THE NATION IF WE START UNDER CUTTING IT NOW BY TAKING AND EXPANDING THE DEFINITION THAT PULLS INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF THE PROTECTIONS OF THE C. CPA. WE HAVE THE WILL OF TAKEN WHAT I THINK IS A WEEK CUP OF TEA AND TURNED IT INTO WATER. SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE DISAGREED -- I DIDN'T SEE THIS LETTER UNTIL SEVEN O'CLOCK TONIGHT BUT NONE THE LAST YOU KNOW IF A GOOD LAWYER WOULD SAY WELL WHAT IS MR LIEBOWITZ. A POSITION NOW WHO DOES HE REPRESENT -- BUT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE CO AUTHORS OF THE ORIGINAL BILL ARE HERE IN VERY STRONG OPPOSITION TO IT COMMONSENSE MEDIA. AND THE FRONTIER OF FOLKS -- OR WHO WORKED ON IT WORKED ON THIS BILL -- IT LAST YEAR TO GET IT PASSED -- ARE NOW STRONGLY OPPOSE BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT IS SOMETIMES POLITELY REFERRED TO IS A JAIL BREAK. THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AND I'D LIKE IS AT A FAIRLY ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF OF HOW YOU SEE THIS BILL AS WELL FOR THIS THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN MIGHT I RESPOND NO SIR YOU CAN RESPOND WHEN THEIR QUESTIONS ASKED SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFS WORK ON THIS. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS. ENGAGEMENT. IN ALL THESE AREAS NOT JUST THAT REPRESENTED IN THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE AUTHOR'S RESPONSE. OR I GUESS MY QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WHY DO YOU FIND THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OBJECTIONABLE? OF BY I WILL CERTAINLY GO THROUGH THAT AND I I WANTED TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE ACLU TALK ABOUT. THE DATA LIKE LET'S SAY I. P. ADDRESSES AS SOON AS AN IP ADDRESS IS. IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IT DOES BECOME PI AND AND THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO SAY THAT. NO INFORMATION THAT IS DE IDENTIFIED CAN BE USED FOR ANYTHING. THEN WE HAVE A REALLY BIG PROBLEM IN BEING ABLE TO DO SCIENTIFIC DATA OR USE BIG DATA TO IMPROVE -- IMPROVE LIVES IT IS IT THERE IS NO THIS IS THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN EFFECT ON RESEARCH THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN EXCESS A AFFECT ON TRANSPORTATION THERE'S ALL SORTS OF BIG DATA DE IDENTIFIED DATA THAT WE CAN USE FOR OUR OWN. FOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF IMPROVING LIVES UGH THE REASON THAT I AM NOT WILLING. TO TAKE THIS LANGUAGE IS FIRST OF ALL THIS LANGUAGE. HAS TAKEN SIX MONTHS OF NEGOTIATION AND THE ACTUAL AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION IT WAS -- ALISTAIR MACTAGGART AND AFTER THAT WE TOOK HIS AMENDMENTS HE DID GO -- NEUTRALIZE IT THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS -- WERE SHARED WITH MY OFFICE LESS THAN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AGO. AND WHILE THE WHOLE COALITION HAS NOT HAD TIME TO FULLY ANALYZE THE PROPOSAL THEIR INITIAL READING. OF THAT RESULTED IN A RESOUNDING OBJECTIONS IS THAT IT WOULD GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND FOR OUR DE IDENTIFIED OF FIX AS A MATTER OF FACT WE THINK THIS FIX IS A WORSE THAN. THE ORIGINAL BILL. UNDER EXISTING. LAW INFORMATION WHICH IS LINKED OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMERS FREELY MARKETABLE INSURABLE UNTIL A CONSUMER OFFICE OUT VERSUS THE CPA. THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE WOULD PROHIBIT THE SALE OR SHARING OF NON LINKED TO OR NON ASSOCIATED DATA ENTIRELY WHICH POSES EXTREMELY LESS RISK TO PRIVACY. BEEN LINKED TO OR ASSOCIATED DATA AND AGAIN I THINK THAT THERE IS. AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEM IF WE SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANY USE OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IN. I'M SURE IF I COULD DIRECT A QUESTION TO THE ACLU REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE I PLACE. WHAT I'M GATHERING FROM THIS? IS A DISAGREEMENT KIND OF AND DEFINITION OF WHAT DOES CONSTITUTE DE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE I'M NOT MISTAKEN. YOU SAID. THE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IN HERE. IT IDENTIFIES ME. IF IT'S IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE ELSE MAYBE NOT WITH MY NAME OR MY ADDRESS. BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS. THIS IDENTIFYING NUMBER IN THIS DEVICE. AND THAT. ALLOWING THAT TO BE SHARED OR PURCHASED OR CONSIDERED. DE IDENTIFIED. IS IN AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION COULD YOU CONFIRM OF FIVE GOT THAT RIGHT OR SURE SURE SO -- THAT UNDER AB -- EIGHT SEVENTY THREE SOMETHING LIKE A DEVICE ID COULD BE CONSIDERED THE IDENTIFIED -- AND THE FURY THERE AND I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THIS FROM -- FROM THE AUTHOR AND FROM THE SUPPORTERS -- THAT THE IDEA IS THAT THAT DEVICE IDENTIFIER DOES NOT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL. THE FACT IS THAT ANYTHING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH MY DEVICE FOR YOUR DEVICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ME OR YOU. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GO TO A WEBSITE ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE. THAT WEBSITE CAN RECOGNIZE -- YOUR BROWSER TO YOUR DEVICE ID OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THAT -- CONNECTION AND THEN THEY CAN SERVE YOU ADVERTISEMENTS -- TO THE SAME PERSON BASED ON THE BEATING THE SAME MOBILE PHONE NOW. THAT MOLD THAT BAD BUT WEBSITE YOU'RE GOING TO DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE SENATOR MONEY. ALL IT KNOWS IS THAT YOU'RE SOMEBODY COMING FROM YOUR PHONE. THAT'S A QUICK WANT TO IDENTIFY YOU TO RECOGNIZING YOU INTO RESPONDING SPECIFICALLY TO YOU AS A PERSON. SO TO TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER. IF I MADE A AMAZON ORDER. ON THIS [inaudible] IN A SOMEBODY ELSE HAD ACCESS TO THIS DEVICE IN ITS PRACTICES IT COULD KNOW WHAT I ORDERED FROM AMAZON WITHOUT NECESSARILY KNOWING. MY NAME OR MY ADDRESS. BUT IT COULD. THEN PROLIFERATE BACK TO THIS DEVICE FURTHER ADVERTISING RELATED TO THAT PURCHASE PREFERENCE WHAT TO KNOW -- USING FOR EXAMPLE A COOKIE IS THEN YOU'DLOOKED AT A PARTICULAR -- PRODUCTS ON AMAZON I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BROWSING AROUND THE INTERNET LOOKING AT A BLENDER OR SOMETHING AND THEN HAVING THAT SAME BLENDER SHOW UP ON DIFFERENT WEBSITES. NOW IT WORK WHOEVER WITH THE AD NETWORK THAT SENDING YOU A PICTURE OF THE BLENDER DOESN'T KNOW YOUR NAME. IT DOESN'T ASSIST MEAN I MIGHT KNOW YOUR NAME BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW YOUR NAME IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW YOUR ADDRESS -- BUT IT DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE PERSON. WHO LOOK AT THAT POINT -- AND SO IT IS COMPILING THIS LIST OF INFORMATION NOW LOOK ALSO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BLENDERS IT'S ABOUT WEBSITE YOU VISIT -- THINGS YOU SEARCH IN A SEARCH ENGINE WHICH CAN REVEAL RELIGIOUS COMMITMENTS POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS. YOUR YOUR THE THE THE YOUR FEARS THAT YOU LOOK INTO A SEARCH NGINE IT POTENTIAL MEDICAL HEALTH ISSUES ALL THAT INFORMATION. CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THE PERSON BUT ALSO WITH DEVICES. UNDER THE BILL BEFORE US THAT. ABILITY TO TRACK. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS CELL PHONE WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED -- IF YOU TAKE A IDENTIFIED. IF YOU TAKE A DEFINITION THE IDENTIFIED DOES NOT INCLUDE IP ADDRESSES IT DOESN'T INCLUDE DEVICE ID'S. THEY WOULD PERMIT THAT KIND OF TRACKING. THANK YOU NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO AS CORRECT -- OR TWO SHARE THE FACT THAT THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF THE AYE FOR DE IDENTIFIED THE CURRENT IN THE CURRENCY CPA. DOES NOT PRECLUDE IN ANYWAY RESEARCH. SO WHAT WHAT THIS NEW DEFINITION DOES IS IT NOW INCLUDES INFORMATION THAT. IS REASONABLY CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED BACK TO US. SO IT BASICALLY. A EXPANDS THE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. THE BECAUSE IT CAN BE REASONABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SAY PUT THAT IN THE BILL -- FOR FURTHER. UP WE'RE MAKING IT POSSIBLE ADDITIONALLY POSSIBLE THAT THAT WILL THAT INFORMATION WE'LL. AND IS THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE READY -- IDENTIFIED WITH US SO IT'S IT'S BASICALLY EXPANDING WHAT'S OUT THERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE. TO GIVE US THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CCPA. AN IN AN EXPANSIVE EVEN FURTHER BY SAYING. IT'S A IT'S INFORMATION IS REASONABLY BE CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED BACK TO US FURTHER. A KIND OF INTRUDING IF YOU WILL OR OR EXACERBATING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CCPA I THINK SENATOR STERN HAD A QUESTION AND CENTER JONES AND THEN CENTER. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I WANTED TO GET SOME RESPONSE FROM I THINK THE OPPOSITION ABOUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE FROM THE AUTHOR. ABOUT THE STATE OF CURRENT LAW UNDER THE SEA CPA AND AND THE PRIVACY RISKS. OF SORT OF FORCING THE READ LINKING TO PERSONAL INFORMATION -- THAT WAS MY FIRST QUESTION AND SECOND I DIDN'T KNOW IF I DIDN'T SEE THE EMAIL FROM -- MR MAKE TAGGART'S ORGANIZATION WHO WE WE SORT OF RELIED ON IS THE ESSENTIAL ARCHITECT OF THIS WHOLE MEASURE DO WE HAVE A COPY THAT I I GOT WE GOT THAT ONE FROM. A MISTER LIEBOWITZ BUT I DON'T I FOURTH THERE'S A REPRESENTATIVE FROM MR MAKE TAGGART'S GROUP HERE. SEE HERE. NOW. THREE TAGS ARE THERE IS THERE ANY REPRESENTATIVE. OF CAN I JUST YOU MIND IF WE JUST GET THAT COMMENT REAL QUICK ON WHAT WHY YOU ALL WENT NEUTRAL HERE AND A LITTLE BACKGROUND THERE. HAPPY TO THROUGH THE CHAIR OF THAT'S OKAY -- DOUG SUPERZOOM HAVE A CALIFORNIA'S FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WE DID WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION BASED UPON AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY. PRIVACY COMMITTEE -- WE DO THINK THAT THE DEFINITION A CHANGES THAT WERE DONE IN ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE TO THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED -- MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE TWENTY TWELVE FTC DEFINITION WE DO CONTEST THAT THE THE READING OF THAT LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW -- ONE TO SIMPLY SEPARATE AN I. P. ADDRESS OR SU DONNA MAIS A PIECE OF DATA AND SUGGEST THAT IS ACTUALLY DE IDENTIFIED -- WE THINK THAT THE FTC LAID OUT TECHNOLOGICAL -- STRATEGIES A RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW YOU ACTUALLY DE IDENTIFIED DATA BUT THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION AND I COMMITTEE AND IS ONE OF THE CLERK. BUT IT. SO THAT SORT OF A LINES THEN I GUESS WITH THE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FORMER FTC CHAIR BUT ANYTHING THAT YOU'D REYES THIS PRIVACY CONCERN OF THE STATE OF CURRENT LAW. I'M YOU MINOR JUST ARTICULATED THAT ONCE MORE THAN MAYBE GETTING SOME RESPONSE FROM THE OPPOSITION THERE. FIRST OF ALL IF IF I MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO TO RESPOND -- THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED IN THE C. C. P. A CURRENTLY HAS FOR CONDITIONS. THAT OUR TECHNICAL THE THE IS A SURE THAT THE SCENARIO THAT THE CHAIRED. RAISED WILL NOT HAPPEN AT WITH OUTSIDE BE OUTSIDE OF THE CCPA. FIRST OF ALL IT SAYS THAT THE THERE NEED TO BE TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS THAT'S NOT JUST RULES THESE ARE TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS. THAT PROHIBIT RE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONSUMERS DATA THERE ALSO HAVE TO BE BUSINESS PROCESS SEES THAT SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT. WE IDENTIFICATION THE DATA IF ANY OF THESE THINGS IS IS NOT MATT THEN THE DATA BECOMES PERSONAL DATA. FURTHERMORE IT HAS THERE HAVE TO BE MET BUSINESS PROCESSES USED TO PREVENT HEATED BURDEN RELEASE OF THE DATA AND THERE HAS TO BE NO ATTEMPT MADE. TO IDENTIFY THE DATA SO THE ENTIRE PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S THAT WAS PRESENTED. DON'T ACCORD WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THIS AMENDMENT THE THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE ALL THE SAFEGUARDS THAT MR SUBER'S REFERENCE. NEED TO BE IN PLACEFOR THIS. EXCEPTION TO APPLY I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I'M STARTING GETTING AT THIS OTHER ISSUE THOUGH OF THE REELING KING DON'T KNOW THE THE THE RETHINKING THE READ MY JUST REITERATING WHAT THAT CONCERN IS AND THEN GETTING HERE'S THE CONSERVE HERE'S THE CONCERN. IF ONE NEEDS IF THERE IS THE DE IDENTIFIED DATA -- DEFINITION WHICH IS CURRENTLY HOPELESSLY VAGUE IT JUST IT IT SAYS ANYTHING THAT'S NOT PERSONAL DATA. IT I AT THE PERSONAL DATA DEAFNESS IS EXTREMELY BROAD COUNTS IS DE IDENTIFIED THE RESULT IS THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH. AN INDIVIDUAL IF AN INDIVIDUAL FILES A ONE OF THESE VERY POSITIVE RIGHTS REQUEST UNDER CCPA WHICH I STRONGLY SUPPORT THEIR GREAT IDEAS PLEASE WHICH LICENSES FOR THIS QUESTION IF THAT REQUEST IS MADE THE BUSINESS HAS. TO SEARCH ALL AROUND ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BUSINESS EVERY CHANNEL STATE SUPPORT DESK. VIDEO. FOR US STORE FOOTAGE TO WILL BE A CHECK FOR SHOPLIFTERS ONLINE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING SUBMITTED AND OF PHONE CALLS THAT COME IN AND HAS TO FIND ALL THAT DATA. AND DELETE IT SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE CAPE OR BOARD SEND IT BACK TO THE CONSUMER THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF FINDING ALL THEIR DATA THEY HAVE TO MAP ALL THEIR DATA. AND ONCE THEY COMBINED THAT DATA. IT'S VERY COSTLY THE BUSINESS INCENTIVE FOR THE BUSINESS IS TO CONTINUE TO USE IT ONCE THEY PUT IT ALL TOGETHER SO YOU WIND UP WITH DATA LINKS I DON'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF BUT I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT. GET TO THE HEART OF IT IN PLAIN PLAIN ENGLISH IS ESSENTIALLY CURRENT LAW. MAYBE YOU CAN CLEAR BY THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES YOU TO GO. GET DEEPER INTO. CONSUMERS PRIVATE DATED TO THEN. RIGHT NOW THE DEFINITION IS A CAPABLE OF YOU KNOW PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION FOR KATE. I PERSONAL INFORMATION IT'S CAPABLE OF IDENTIFIED -- BEING IDENTIFIED WITH HER SO THAT. ADDING THE REASONABLY AND I'D THE WAY I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT IT IN THE EXAMPLE IN THE SHEET IS THAT IF YOU'RE IN A DEPARTMENT STORE AND YOU'RE USING A CREDIT CARD -- THE DEPARTMENT STORE HAS AND YOU DO TELL NOW THE DEPARTMENT STORE THAT YOU WANT -- TO A RIGHT YOU WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN SO THEY GO IN AND REYES ALL THE RECORDS THEY HAVE ABOUT YOU ALL THE PURCHASES THAT YOU MADE THAT THEY THEY ARE RACE EVERYTHING THAT THEY THAT THE KID THEY CAN REASONABLY ASSOCIATE WITH YOU. BUT IF YOU GET RID OF THE REASONABLY THEN THEY HAVE TO START GETTING ADDITIONAL PIECES OF DATA TO TRY TO DELETE THOSE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU GO TO THE STORE CAMERA NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE. A FACIAL RECOGNITION BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU'RE ON THE STORE CAMERA OR WHAT IF THERE'S A CAMERA NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM AND THEN WE YOU BUT IF THERE'S A CAMERA NEAR THE BATHROOM NOW YOU HAVE. TO IDENTIFY. OF IDENTIFIED EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT STORE HAS TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE -- TO DELETE SO THAT'S WHY THE DEFINITION OF CAPABLE IS IT COULD BE RIGHT NOW IT'S GOOD AND AND IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PULL TOGETHER IT'S REALLY ANTI PRIVACY OR COULD BE IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW IT COULD BE ALL OF A SUDDEN. YOU USE SOME RANDOM COMPUTER AT YOUR BUSINESS AND OF NOW NOW WITH YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE THAT BUSINESS -- THAT THAT NOW THEY CAN OF LINK THAT I. P. ADDRESS TO YOU AND NOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STORE US TO GO OUT SO THAT'S WHY WE WE IN OUR AMENDMENTS. THAT WE REQUESTED THEY TAKE ALLOWED THE ADDITION OF REASONABLY TO PERSONAL INFORMATION TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S A SIMPLE CLARIFICATION. WE PUT IN NOT THE BLOWING UP OF THE ENTIRE DEFINITION DE IDENTIFIED. AND I THINK DID YOU WANT. TO RESPOND TO THAT YES I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TO COME THROUGH SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE TO CONNECT PEOPLE. THE AMENDMENT. OFFERED THE COMMITTEE WE WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ROUTINE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE AND RE IDENTIFY PEOPLE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE C. CPA THE REQUIRES READ ON A VACATION. ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT MR SUBER'S COMMENT ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE SEE THE CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY HAD OFFERED. AND HE CONTESTED THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LANGUAGE HE HE WAS CONTESTING THE AUTHOR'S. INTERPRETATION OF THE LANGUAGE I SHE SHARED IN HER AND TEN AN EXPLANATION OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO READ IT THAT WAY EITHER BUT THAT'S THE WAY. IT'S BEING THAT'S THE WAY IT'S READ AND THAT'S THE WAY THE AUTHORS READING AND THAT'S THE WAY WE BELIEVE THE COURT WOULD READ ITS INTENT TO EXCLUDE IP ADDRESSES [inaudible] WHICH SO I DON'T SO I JUST. THE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WERE INTENDING TO OFFER SOMETHING THAT THEY BELIEVED WOULD EXCLUDE IP ADDRESSES FROM THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. HOWEVER THAT IS HOW IT'S BEING. TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR AND HOW IT IS BEING. AND PUSH MAY INDUSTRY AND THEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE OFFERED CORRECTED THAT. THOSE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE OFFERED AND BY THE WAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO -- BUT SE JUST GOT THE IMMENSE TWO DAYS AGO. OF THE FINAL AMENDMENTS THIRDS BEEN A NEGOTIATION IS YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON THAT SOMETIMES THESE ANALYSES COME AT THE LAST MINUTE IS THAT WE ARE CONTINUING. TO WORK ON THE GOSHEN SO IT WASN'T LIKE THESE WERE SOMETHING OUT OF THE CLEAR BLUE THIS WAS THE FINAL GIVEN TAKE. OUR AFTER HAVING GONE BACK AND FORTH OVER THE VARIOUS CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED THIS IS BEEN A LOT. THIS IS BEEN A OF ON GOING IN A FAIRLY LENGTHY. PROCESS. THE SENATE US SENATOR JOHN SHOULD YOU WANT TO ASK A QUESTION AND I'M SURE -- IN MY ANSWERS TURNED ADDRESS ON MY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPONENTS. AT A YOU KNOW EQUAL TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE DIET BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE KIND OF GETTING CUT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION SO. I APPRECIATE CENTER STERN -- BRINGING THAT BACK TO THEM -- YOU KNOW I WASN'T HERE FOR THIS IS PAID NEGOTIATIONS SO I'M TRYING. TO NO CATCH UP. WITH ALL OF YOU ON THIS I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE TODAY -- I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BILL AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN -- SO IF THE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE AND THE AND THE AUTHOR ONCE A MOTION ON I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THAT MOTION -- AND THEN I JUST YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT IN HER CLOTHES SHE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED BY -- EITHER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OR THE OPPOSITION THAT SHE HAS A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO THE CLOSINGS ALWAYS TO PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SENATOR -- SENATOR -- BURKE. QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. A VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE. I DO BILL I THINK OF THE CENTER JONES HAS ALREADY DONE THAT -- ALL RIGHT -- AGAIN. SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR -- WELL THE MASSES FOR THEIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. OF SENATOR THE TWO WE HAVE A MOTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE. OF I'D I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ON THIS AND YOU KNOW WE DO OF MUCH MORE AGREEMENT THAN NOT THAT'S THE MAKING SURE THAT THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED IS IS WORKABLE IS -- CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SPENT SIX MONTHS. OF ON THIS EFFORT AND NOW I DO WANT -- TO ONCE MORE A REITERATE THAT ONCE INFORMATION S RE IDENTIFIED IT'S NOW PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER CCPA WHICH MEANS AGAIN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN ONE FINAL THING IS GPR WHICH PASSED IN EUROPE AND THAT WAS AFTER VERY EXTENSIVE EFFORTS. HAS A VERY LOW COMPLIANCE RATE RIGHT NOW ALLEN I THINK IT IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA GET A RIGHT THAT WE MAKE IT. IT MAKES THE CPA WORKABLE FOR NOT ONLY OUR GOOGLE'S WHO ARE ALREADY TRYING. TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT WE MAKE IT OF WORKABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES HERE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. EVERY BUSINESS UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PROTECT OUR PRIVACY AND WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS THAT AND REITERATING THIS AGAIN I WANT TO SEE OTHER STATES FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD WITH A REALLY WORKABLE. A SOLUTION THAT PROTECTS THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS AND AMERICAN CITIZENS AND IF WE DO NOT GET IT RIGHT THERE WILL BE FEDERAL PREEMPTION THE THE THERE WILL BE SO MUCH PRESSURE FROM THE TECH COMPANIES IF WE HAVE THIS BIG PATCHWORK. OF OF OF LAWS THROUGHOUT THE STATES THERE WILL BE FEDERAL PREEMPTION SO -- I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL I THINK AND I APPRECIATE THE MOTION THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE [inaudible] I APPRECIATE [inaudible] ALL [inaudible] AND THAT I HAVE YOU KNOW WITH THAT -- YEAH -- BY THE AUTHOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK.

ALL RIGHT -- THE SECOND TO LAST ITEM WE HAVE IT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PERKS -- FILE ITEM TWENTY EIGHT AB [inaudible] EIGHT FORTY SIX GOOD EVENING. A GOOD EVENING I KNOW IT'S LATE. AND I WANNA SAY FIRST OF ALL OF THE CHAIRS PREVIOUS COMMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT UNDERMINE THE CCPA. AND I HAVE HERE -- DOCUMENTS TO BE HANDED OUT TO EVERYONE IN THE COMMITTEE. TO SHOW THAT THE SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL PRIVACY -- PROPOSITION. HAS MOVED WITH OUR AMENDMENTS TO NEUTRAL. SENATORS AB EIGHT FORTY SIX CLARIFIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT IS NOT INTENDED TO PROHIBIT BUSINESSES FROM OFFERING CONSUMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS. WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE C. C. PA BUSINESSES ARE QUESTIONING WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH OUR CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND ARE SEEKING CLARITY IN THE LAW. TO CONTINUE THEIR OFFERINGS CONSUMERS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE APPRECIATE THESE PROGRAMS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AIRLINE MILES OR POINTS -- ACCUMULATED FOR FREE ITEMS IN THE GROCERY STORE 80% OF AMERICANS BELONG TO AND BENEFIT. FROM AT LEAST ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS AB EIGHT FORTY SIX IS INTENDED TO CONTINUE TO GIVE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO JOIN THESE PROGRAMS. AND BENEFITS FROM THE REWARDS. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THAT ALISTAIR MAKE THAGARD IN CALIFORNIA FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY ON AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MOVE THEM TO NEUTRAL. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THROUGH THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AB EIGHT FORTY SIX WOULD STRIKE ONE FOUR NINE EIGHT POINT ONE TWO SIX EIGHT TWO ON FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE LANGUAGE ENSURING. AND ALSO ENSURE CONSUMERS CAN OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION PURSUANT. TO SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE TWO ZERO AND STILL MAINTAIN THEIR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. ALSO TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE STILL COMPLYING WITH SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE TWO FIVE BE AND THE NON DISK DISCRIMINATION SECTION OF CCPA WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN TO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. IT IS ALSO THE CLARIFY THAT A CONSUMER WHO VOLUNTARILY OPT OUT OF A PROGRAM A REQUEST THE DELETION OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION ONCE THEY LEAVE THE PROGRAM. BIRDS ARE INTO SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT. ONE OH FIVE SHE DOES ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT CLEAR DID YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT OUR AMENDMENTS NOW I I'LL GO THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT WE WILL ACCEPT AND WHAT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO ACCEPT IN JUST A MOMENT. I'M ALSO WE'RE CLARIFYING THAT A CONSUMER WHO VOLUNTARILY ON SADDAM PROGRAM YOUR QUEST THE DELETION OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION ONCE THEY LEAVE THE PROGRAM PERCENT IN. SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT THOSE WERE THOUGHTFUL AND CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED MOMENTS WITH THE OPPOSITION THE COMMITTEE NOW SIX SUGGEST ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS BEYOND THE LANGUAGE AGREED UPON WITH THE OPPOSITION. I CAN COMMIT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS E. ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS. AS WELL THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE FUNCTIONALITY PROVISION OF THE BILL LISTEN ON PAGE. TEN HOWEVER PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DE AND ASKED. AT SPECIFICALLY AFTER WOULD ENACT GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND ANY OTHER CCPA REQUIRED ON ANY OTHER REGULATIONS OF DATA. PARAGRAPH X. F. STATES THAT BUSINESSES SHALL NOT OFFER A LOYALTY PROGRAM WITHOUT EXPRESS SICKLY EXPRESSLY IN HIS VICIOUSLY PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH THE OPTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. ON EQUAL TERMS WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS WITHOUT CONSENTING TO THE SHARING OR SALE OF THE CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES. THIS LANGUAGE WOULD INTRODUCE AN UNDEFINED TERM OF SHARING INTO THE CCPA WITH THE RESTRICTION ON LOYALTY PROGRAMS. FURTHERMORE IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT DEFINES THIRD PARTIES IN THIS PROVISION ANY AMBIGUITY COULD OPEN BUSINESSES UP TO POSSIBLE LITIGATION FOR EXAMPLE. MARRIOTT LET'S SEE A MARRIOTT IS OWNED BY A PRIVATE. ONE OF THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY A PRIVATE COMPANY THEN NOT ONE PROPERTY COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS OF THE ENTIRE. PROPERTIES SO THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD BE. PUT INTO QUESTION AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS. I AM WILLING TO TAKE TWO OF THE FOUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WITH THE COMMITMENT TO CLARIFY AND WORKING ON BOTH THE N. F.. SHOULD THEM SHOULD THE THIS MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE. CENTERS AB EIGHT FORTY SIX IS A STRAIGHT FOR A BILL CONSUMERS APPRECIATE LOYALTY PROGRAMS. AND PARTS OF MY DISTRICT EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS. IT MY CONSTITUENTS CAN EARN SOMETHING RETURN FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND MORE KNOWING THEIR PRIVACY IS STILL PART BEING PROTECTED WHY SHOULD THEY BE DENIED THIS BENEFIT. TO ASSUME THAT MINORITIES ARE PEOPLE OF LOW MEANS ARE NOT INTELLIGENT ENOUGH OR THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVES IS INSULTING AND IT'S A NARRATIVE IN THIS BUILDING. THAT NEEDS TO STOP. BUSINESSES NEED TO CLARITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER THESE PROGRAMS TO PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH VARYING SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS IN NEEDS. WITHOUT THIS BILL BUSINESSES MAY NOT CONTINUE TO OFFER CONSUMER TO LOYALTY PROGRAMS RESIDENTS OF EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT ON THIS BILL IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED BY THE NEGOTIATED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ALLOW HIGHLY BENEFICIAL PROGRAMS. TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. ORDER GLASS THE NUMBER HAVE THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FORTY SIX BECAUSE IT DOES CLARIFY THE LAW. AND SAYS THAT RETAILERS CAN OPERATE AND OTHERS CAN OPERATE LOYALTY PROGRAMS WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF CCPA WE UNDERSTAND THERE SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE LAW THAT ALLOW FOR THE OPERATIONS THE PROGRAMS BUT THE CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN THE NON DISCRIMINATION SECTION. LEAVES US QUESTIONING WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO WE JUST WANT THE CLARITY WHICH AB EIGHT FORTY SIX GIVES US. AS THE AUTHOR NOTED MANY CONSUMERS CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS IN FACT THE BILL SPECIFICALLY REFERENCES THAT CONSUMERS. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAMS IN OTHER WORDS CONSUMERS ARE MAKING THEIR OWN DECISION ON WHETHER TO JOIN OR NOT IF THEY WE DON'T WANT TO SHARE THEIR DATA OR THEY DON'T DO ALTHOUGH THE VOTE THE REWARDS ARE WORTH EARNING. FACE THEN THEY SIMPLY CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE OFTEN LOYALTY. PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY POPULAR IN FACT I WOULD BET THAT ALL OF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF THE LEAST ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE PERHAPS MANY OF THEM. IT'S NOT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT PROGRAMS FORCE PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE UP THEIR DATA GIVEN THE WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS FROM TOP OF THE LINE HOTEL CHANGE ENTICEMENTS LIKE FLASH CLASS ARE FREE FLIGHTS. TO DESIGNER FASHION SHOWS THESE PROGRAMS DON'T JUST TARGET THE POOR. CONSUMERS ACCESS THE SOCIAL ACCOUNT CONSUMERS ACROSS THE SOCIO ECONOMIC. SPECTRUM APPRECIATE THE DISCOUNTS AND SPECIAL OFFERS THEY RECEIVE AND OUR MEMBERS USE REWARDS FOR ONE SIMPLE PURPOSE TO CREATE CUSTOMER LOYALTY WE DO NOT SELL CUSTOMER DATA IN FACT WE'VE AGREED TO LANGUAGE CLARIFYING JUST THAT. THE CONSUMERS WANT TO OPT OUT OF HAVING THEIR DATA SOLD. WERE WILLING INSTEAD LONGER PROGRAMS WILLING TO ALLOW THAT WE WORK TO GOOD FAITH WITH THE SERVER TAG OR TO REACH A COMPROMISE THAT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE COMMITTEES SEEKING. BUT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS GO TOO FAR IT MAKES NO SENSE TO HAVE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON DEBT HELD BY OFTEN LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND OTHER DATA GEVORK GOVERNED BY CCPA WE'RE ASKING FOR A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. TO THE GREEN OFFER THESE PROF UP -- THESE POPULAR PROGRAMS WE ASK YOU TO PASS A BEAT FORTY SIX AS A PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED BY THE YANKEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM AND TEAR -- AND MEMBERS -- KELLY ASHER THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS AND YOU KNOW WE'VE COME TOGETHER WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE THESE CLARIFYING. AMENDMENTS AND WE ARE EXCITED THAT. WE ARE NOW ABLE -- TO HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND NOT LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE CONSUMER. IN LOYALTY PROGRAMS. AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS A NEEDED FIX TO THE CCPA TO ENSURE OUR CUSTOMERS CAN KEEP RECEIVING THESE BENEFITS OTHER LOYAL SHOPPING. I'M YOU KNOW THE GROCERY INDUSTRY IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND WE HAVE VERY SMALL MARGINS AND SO OUR CUSTOMERS ARE A TOP PRIORITY FOR US. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING PRICES LOW AND THINGS LOW FOR THEM AND SO IF THERE IS A WAY WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENSURE TO DO THAT -- I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE -- TO MAKE A NOTE THAT WE AND THE GROCERY INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE SUPERMARKET CLUB CARD ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHICH DOES PUT PARAMETERS AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE INFORMATION. FROM OUR LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAMS. THANK YOU.

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE IT FORCES CONSUMERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN AFFORDABLE NECESSITIES AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH LOYALTY PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON THE INTERNAL TRACKING UPDATE UP COMPANIES ARE FREE. TO KEEP TRACK OF CONSUMER PURCHASES AND OFFERS CONSUMERS BENEFITS BASED ON THAT -- AND IT'S EASY PA HAS NO IMPLICATIONS ON THAT WHATSOEVER BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT REWARDING CONSUMER LOYALTY IT'S ABOUT. GIVING COMPANIES THE RIGHT TO CHARGE CONSUMERS MORE FOR EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CCPA. INCLUDING OPTING OUT OF SALE THEIR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTY DATA BROKERS THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMERS IN WAYS THEY COULDN'T REASONABLY ANTICIPATE. COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CHARGE CONSUMERS OR MONETIZE -- BASIC RIGHTS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ALTHOUGH. pSAFETY RATES TO ENSURE THAT POOR PEOPLE CAN'T BE FORCED. TO BUY -- PRODUCTS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO THEM -- THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ARE NOT ARE IDEAL SCENARIO BUT WE THINK THAT THEY WOULD GO A LONG WAY -- TO ENTERING A COMPROMISE AND MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CCPA WITHOUT BEING PENALIZED IN. ANYWAY -- IT WITHOUT THAT WOULD RESULT FOR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLACED YES -- MINUTES HI TRACY CREWS IN BURKE FROM OAKLAND PRIVACY WE CAME IN THIS EVENING WHICH WITH TO CONCERNS ABOUT EIGHT FORTY SIX ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN. AMENDED OUT WHICH WAS THE FUNCTIONAL QUICK REQUIREMENT FOR THE USE OF DATA WHICH WE WANT TO SAY WAS CATEGORICALLY A BACK DOOR. TO PAY TO PRIVACY WHICH WE DID AGREE TO TAKE YES AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THE SECOND CONCERN THAT WE HAVE -- IS WITH THE AMENDMENT OF THE AUTHOR IS NOT TAKING AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT UTILIZING PEOPLE X.. FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHTS THAT ARE GRANTED TO THEM UNDER THE CPA AND WHAT KIND OF A RIGHT. IS IT IF YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO PAY IN ORDER TO EXECUTE IT. I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL THAT LOYALTY PROBLEMS ARE BY THE PROGRAMS ARE BY THEIR VERY DEFINITION OPT IN I MEAN MOST PEOPLE DON'T END UP AND ROLLED IN A FREQUENT FLYER PLAN WITHOUT ACTUALLY TAKING SOME ACTION TO DO THAT. BUT THE QUESTION IS SORT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE OPTING IN CHIU AND DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. YES TO A POTENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING NO TO MOST OF US MIGHT THINK THAT WE MIGHT BE SOLD SOME ADVERTISEMENTS FOR HOTEL ROOMS BUT WE MAY NOT THINK THAT ARE INFO IS GOING OUT. TO FIFTY DIFFERENT DATA BROKERS SO THE QUESTION OF SORT OF WHAT WE'RE AGREEING TO AND WHETHER WE IN FACT HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET OUT OF THAT AGREEMENT. WITHOUT PAYING IS WHATWE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN AS I UNDERSTAND IT LOYALTY PROGRAM IN AN OF THEMSELVES ARE NOT PREVENTED. FROM PRECEDING. ARE WITHOUT CCPA SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS REALLY THE RIGHT TO CHARGE PEOPLE FOR OPTING OUT AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OUR OUR FAX JOHNSON WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA OF WITH THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TAKEN WE WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. JACOB SO WITH THE CITY OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD ALSO REMOVE OPPOSITION WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT WERE POST. THANK YOU. ACCORDING TO THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE ALSO OPPOSED ABSENT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BEING TAKEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT I'M SURE MEMBERS DOCTORS I HAVE A CALIFORNIA'S FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WE ARE POSTED ON PRINT DO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AND THE SPONSORS ON AMENDMENTS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. BEFORE AND I THINK WE'LL LOOK AT WHATEVER FIX OUT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO A POINT -- AND I THINK OUR AMENDMENTS TO I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE -- TAKING THE TO THE FORE BUT THE OTHER TWO ARE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT. SO I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE I THINK WE'RE ALL PART OF THESE -- PROGRAMS -- I WAS THINKING BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS TO IT WE HAVE RETAILERS AND GROCERS HERE. AND I MEMBERS I DON'T THINK TOO MANY OF YOU REMEMBER SNH GREEN STAMPS -- THERE YOU GO. AND THE BLUE CHIPS STAMPS YOU GO TO THE STORE AND YOU BUY CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND YOU GET STAMPS REAL RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS SPENT OR WITH THE PRODUCT YOU BINDING BROUGHT IT HOME YOU GOT TO LOOK AT IN AND PUT IN THE BOOK AND YOU GET. A BOOK SHE CAN GET A TOASTER. THAT'S A LOYALTY PROGRAM. BUT YOU KNOW EXACTLY. OR WE KNEW WAY BACK THEN BEFORE ALL THIS INFORMATION GATHERING THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT YOU GOT A TOASTER AND YOU WENT BACK TO THE STORE AND YOU DID YOUR SHOPPING AND YOU GOT ANOTHER TOASTER WHATEVER IT WAS THAT YOU WANTED. TODAY IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE VERY DIFFERENT -- THEY'RE A GREAT THING I THINK THOSE OF US WHO. HAVE TO FLY UP HERE EVERY WEEK FOR ON SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WE OPT INTO THEIR LOYALTY PROGRAM. I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE -- TO TO HAVE MY HUSBAND IS MY COMPANION. TO ACCRUE MILES SO THAT I CAN GO VISIT MY GRAND KIDS -- BUT BUT PART OF THAT IS WHAT IS HAVE ME THAT I'M IN A LOYALTY PROGRAM I MEAN IT'S LOYALTY I'M EXPRESSING MY LOYALTY TO THE COMPANY. IN EXCHANGE FOR WITH WHICH I GET BENEFITS WHAT I DON'T KNOW. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TELL US NOW IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THAT INFORMATION. AND I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE ISSUE HERE. SO THE THE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL UP MAKES IT CLEAR THE BUSINESS CAN OFFER SPECIAL PERKS TO MEMBERS OF THEIR FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE OR DISCOUNTS TO THEIR GROCERY. STORE REWARDS PROGRAM AND I SMILE WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW THE IT HE SAID FOR THOSE STAMPS JUST TASTED SO BAD -- AND I CAN STILL TASTE IT BUT IT WAS FUN YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU HAD A BOOK IN YOU COULD BUY SOMETHING WITH IT. A BOOK OF STAMPS BUT THAT YOU DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE BUT THIS BILL HOWEVER DOES NOT CONSTRAIN WHAT THE BUSINESS CAN DO WITH PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT THEN COLLECTS AS PART OF THE PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M GOING TO TAKE A TRIPLET SAY TO HAWAII ON MY FREQUENT FLYER MILES. USING OF MYSELF WHICH MILES -- DO I KNOW THAT THE IN ADDITION SUDDENLY I'M GOING TO START GETTING ALL THESE ADS FOR HAWAIIAN SHIRTS OR FOR A FLIP FLOPS OR MAYBE HOTELS TO STAY IN HAWAII. NOW I MAY WANT TO DO THAT I MAY SAY THIS IS A GREAT ADDITION BUT I WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE THE RIGHT. TO SAY THAT OR NOT AND IF I AM GOING TO OPT OUT OF THEIR PROGRAM. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THEN AND THIS IS PART OF WHAT THE BILL CURRENTLY DOES. IS IF I OPT OUT. I CAN'T GET THE SAME BENEFITS. AND AND THAT IS A PROBLEM IF I WANT MY PRIVACY THEN I HAVE TO PAY FOR MY PRIVACY WE HAVE SITUATIONS TODAY WITH GROCERY STORES YOU ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN. FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND THEY GO GROCERY SHOPPING OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO AGREE TO THE TO THE COUPONS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEY NEED THEY NEED THAT. THEY NEED THAT LOAF OF BREAD -- BUT IF THEY SAY BUT I DON'T WANT YOU USING MY INFORMATION TO WELL THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE THEY'VE GOT TO PAY MORE. AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT AT LEAST I HAVE AND I WANT TO ASK THESE FOLKS -- A ON THE PRIVACY THING I DO YOU SELL YOUR INFIRMITY I ALL THAT INFORMATION WOULD LIKE NOT EXCUSE ME DO YOU SELL THAT INFORMATION AND ALL ENTRANTS OR DO YOU SELL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GET. WHEN PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THESE REWARDS PROGRAMS? MARK REPLIES RAFTER RETAILERS NO WE DO NOT SELL THE INFORMATION. SO IF YOU DON'T SELL IT THEN WHY WOULD YOU WHY DO YOU CARE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE WANT TO OPT OUT WHY DO YOU WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THEM. WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO THEM THAT THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM IF THEY OPT OUT OR THE GONNA HAVE TO PAY MORE? IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE REWARDS WE NEED YOU SOONER JACKSON I'LL JUST HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH YOUR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE YOUR WORDS TO GO TO HAWAII. THAN SOUTHWEST AIRLINES GOING TO NEED TO KNOW IS YOU THAT HAS EARNED THOSE REWARDS SO THAT'S THE RIGHT [inaudible] THAT'S GREAT. THAT THAT ISN'T THE PROBLEM I DON'T MIND IT YOU KNOW IN FACT YOU NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE IT'S ME BARRING THE TAKING THE TRIP WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN ADDITION IS. THAT INFORMATION THEN THEN YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU WANT TO START SHOWING ME I START GETTING INFORMATION FROM TRIPADVISOR BUT GOOD RESTAURANTS -- TO GO TO WAR I STARKID RETIREMENT HERE'S A COUPON IF YOU'LL COME TO OUR RESTAURANT WHEN YOU'RE IN HAWAII. I I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT. YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU. IT'S MADAM CHAIR IT IS MY BILL AND SO I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND BECAUSE IT AND AND YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO RENEGE ON EXCUSE ME. YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE RESPOND I WANTED TO ASK THE INDUSTRY WHETHER OR NOT THEY SELL THE INFORMATION AGAIN YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T. OKAY SO WE DO NOT SO -- FOR USE A RETAIL EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE PROVIDED A COUPON FOR SOMETHING WE KNOW YOU WANT TO BUY IT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU WANT TO BUY NOT BECAUSE WE'RE PROVIDING. ARE YOUR DATA TO THAT MANUFACTURER SO WE KNOW THAT YOU LIKE. BEAUTIFUL BLUE JACKETS SO WE MAY SERVE YOU COUPONS OR NOT HOWEVER SAME ONE FASHION FROM THE STATE. WE WE MAY SERVE YOU -- OFFERS OR ADVERTISE JET BLUE JACKETS YOU THROUGH YOUR LOYALTY MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU LIKE BLUE JACKETS BUT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THAT SAME INFORMATION TO THE DESIGNER WHO CREATES THOSE JACKETS. OKAY TANK YOU YOU MAY RESPOND AT THE END OF THE CPPCC PA WE ALREADY ARE DICTATED WE'RE NOT ASKING TO CHANGE THAT WERE ACTUALLY WILLING TO IT HERE TO THE CURRENCY CPA WHICH SELLS WHAT CAN OR CAN'T BE SHARED SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THAT. HOW AND WE ALSO ARE NOT AGREEING TO SELL THE INFORMATION SO EVEN IF WE NEEDED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AGAIN IN THIS BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE ARE HAPPY TO DO THAT HOWEVER THE CCPA WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT AGREEMENT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THAT? AND THE OPPOSITION I WANT TO ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THEM WE'RE NOT THERE THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT WERE SELLING THE INFORMATION WE'RE NOT SELLING THE INFORMATION WE ARE HEARING TO THE C. CPA IN THIS BILL WE'RE NOT EXPANDING IT WERE STAYING TO IT. AS POOR THE HAND OUT WE GAVE TO YOU AND THIS NOTION THAT THAT WE ARE SELLING POOR PEOPLE SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT. I CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THEY DID SAY THAT AND SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THERE'S NO SALE HERE THERE'S NO SALE TO JOIN THE LOYALTY PROGRAM WE ALL JOIN THEM AND WE ALL KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING TO GET INTO. THEM SO YOU ALL HAVE PROOF OF THAT IN YOUR OWN CURRENT EXPERIENCE AND THE OPPOSITE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT. THAT WE WE AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THE FACT THAT THIS DATA SHOULD NOT BE SOLD WE ARE HEARING TO NOT. AND THEN THE SECOND CONCEPT OF BEING SOLD POOR PEOPLE BEING SOLD SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT IS NOT PART OF THIS PROP THAT IF I DON'T THINK WAS WHAT THEY DID SAY THAT ACTUALLY AS I JUST ON MY LOOK VERY CALL IT THEM CLARIFY THERE BUT SO WOULD YOU. TAKEN AMENDMENT TO RESTRICT ALL SALES THAT YOU WON'T BE SELLING ANY OF THIS INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. YEAH I WOULD. WE TAKE THAT A MOMENT ABSOLUTELY AND BY THE WAY WE ACTUALLY SAID IN THE STATEMENT WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO CLARIFY WHAT SHARE MEANS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS A THERE IS IF THIS IS NOT CLEAR AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CLARIFY NOT MAKE THINGS MORE. CONFUSING. I RESPECT WHAT WAS DONE IN THE C. C. P. AND I RESPECT THAT THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DID LAST YEAR I REALLY DO -- WHEN I WENT TO MY DISTRICT AND TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THE LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE GOING AWAY OVER ALL THE OTHER BILLS I WAS WORKING ON? PEOPLE'S FIRST ALERT WAS THAT RAIN AND SO I RESPECT THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON CCPA I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE IT I'M NOT TRYING TO LOOSEN IT. I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS MORE CLEAR SO A MEMO THAT WERE PROPOSED UNFORTUNATELY FOR US. PARTS OF THEM WERE NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR BUT WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE LEFT AND LEFT UNCLEAR. ARE MADE MORE CLEAR SO WOULD YOU TAKE A MOMENT TO RESTRICT ALL SALES FOR PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THESE LOYALTY PROGRAM SO YOU WON'T BE SELLING THE ITEM I DO. IT'S MY REAL THE COULD LOOK I UNDERSTAND NO NO NO I OF AYE IF YOU WILL I WILLING TO DO THAT I THINK THAT MAKES CARE OF A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. YEAH RIGHT IT'S VERY GOOD APP BUT IT IS WE ARE NOT GOING TO SELL THE INFORMATION. OKAY KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. WHAT WE SHARE IS COMPLICATED AND THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO CLARIFY SHARE -- SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR BECAUSE I'M ANSWER THAT'S OKAY PLEASE FEEL FREE. I'M SURE IT THE PROBLEM IS IS THE WAY IT'S DEFINED IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE WERE GIVEN SHARES AND CLEAR SO LIKE SO WHAT HAPPENS ISN'T THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH SHARE MAY BE. THE MAJOR CORPORATION HAS A PRIVATE LITTLE PORTION THAT HAS MORE LIKE I SAID MORE MARRIOTT HOTELS. ON THIS AFFECTS HOTEL WORKERS RIGHT THIS WE HAVE ANOTHER HOTEL THAT THERE'S A AND THAT. SPECIFIC PROPERTY AS A PRIVATE PROPERTY. ACCORDING TO THE MOMENT THAT WE WERE GIVEN IT WOULDN'T ALLOW US TO SHARE THOSE THOSE POINTS WITH THAT PARTICULAR HOTEL WHICH GETS SUPER COMPLICATED. WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT SHARE MEANS WE JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT PASSING A BILL TO MAKE IT MORE UNCLEAR I'M PASSING A BILL TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR -- AND MIGHT LIKE I SAID MY GOAL IS NOT. TO TO ANA DISMISSED THE CCPA AND I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MICK JAGGER AND NEUTRAL SHOWS THAT WE HAVE DONE THE WORK TO DO THAT [inaudible] BUT I STILL IT THEY HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL AND LIKE I SAID. IN MY DISTRICT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAMS AND EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS EVEN FOR MYSELF BE CLEAR I'M A SINGLE MOTHER AND JUST LIKE THAT JUST LIKE THE SENATOR SAID. I USE MY CREDIT CARD TO GET SOUTH WEST POINT AND NOT TELL MY DAUGHTER GETS HERE. EVERY WEEK BECAUSE I'VE USE THAT CREDIT CARD NUMBER ON THOSE POINTS. THESE POINTS BATTERY PEOPLE AND LOYALTY MATTERS TO COMPANIES AND TO PEOPLE AND THE BENEFITS THAT COME WITH THAT ARE IN. ARE IMPORTANT AND WE ALL AGREE ON THAT AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEANER CENTER MONEY. THE CLEAR FINE -- IT DOES SOUND LIKE THE AUTHORS WILLING TO HAVE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE THAT INFORMATION CAN'T BE SOLD -- WHICH I THINK ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE CONCERNS I ALSO THINK JUST TO BE CLEAR MY UNDERSTANDING. WHEN? OPPONENTS SUGGESTED THAT YOU HAD. TO YOU HAD TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF WHAT WAS OFFERED. I UNDERSTOOD THAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY NOT THAT YOU HAD. TO PUT DOWN MONEY HERE RIGHT IT CHECKER HAVE SOMETHING TAKEN OUT OF YOUR CREDIT CARD. BUT RATHER IF YOU WANT TO EXERCISE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT. THE YOU LOSE THEN THE BENEFIT OF BEING A MEMBER OF THE LAW AND I GET THAT AND THAT'S WHAT LOYALTY IS. I MEAN THAT IS THE PROCESS RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU BUT REFER TO IT WHEN YOU SPENDING YOUR MONEY WITH SOME YOU GET A DISCOUNT. BUT CURRENTLY THERE'S NO COST TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LOYALTY. PROGRAM. BUT IF YOU WANT. TO ASK THAT YOUR INFORMATION NOT BE SHARED OR SOLD. YOU CAN LOSE THE BENEFIT AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND IT IS IT'S IT'S A LOSS OF THE BENEFIT OF BEING LOYAL TO A SPECIFIC. COMPANY OR AT AND BY THE WAY THAT'S A BENEFIT AND IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. TO IS SOON THEN I'M TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER NO NO DON'T IT WHETHER I AM TOO I CAN'T EVALUATE IF IT'S MORE IPORTANT TO ME. TO SHARE TO MAKES TO TO HAVE THAT LOYALTY AND TO BE PART OF THAT PROGRAM OR WHETHER IT'S BETTER FOR ME TO OPT OUT AND NOT BE PART OF THAT. SHOULD BE MY CHOICE RIGHT. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THE WAY YOU'RE CHARACTERIZING IT. IT'S IF I WANT TO PROTECT MY PRIVACY RIGHT. I'M GONNA SACRIFICE THE BENEFITS AND NOT YOUR CHOICE. IT IS A THAT RESULTS CHOICE THAT WE ARE ADDING ACOSTA I'M GIVING UP A BENEFIT TO PROTECT MY PRIVACY. AND THAT IS A CHOICE WE WE MAKE WE MAKE CHOICES EVERY DAY WE MAKE A CHOICE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO GO TO WORK TO THIS MORNING WE MAKE ALL SORTS OF CHOICES AND YES. I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT THAT IF NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION IN THEIR DATABASE. THEN YOU CHOICE CHOOSE TO PAY THE PRICES THAT EVERYONE ELSE PAYS. I AGREE THAT THAT IS TO BE ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER OF ANYTHING WHEN I WALK INTO A RESTAURANT. THAT I GO TO ALL THE TIME AND MY GUY SEES ME HE SAYS ALL. WOULD YOU LIKE A FREE APPETIZER TODAY THAT'S MUCH HE OFFERS THAT BECAUSE I COME THERE ALL THE TIME RIGHT AND HE GIVES THAT TO ME FOR COMING ALL THE TIME. IT IS A CHOICE THAT THAT YOU MAKE I CAN'T AND I THINK IT WOULD BE. FEEL LIKE LESS OF A SACRIFICE IF I KNEW. MEETING A MEMBER THAT LOYALTY CLUB. DID NOT. I HAD THE ASSURANCE THAT MY INFORMATION WOULDN'T BE SOLD SO PERHAPS WHAT WE CAN DO TO CLARIFY AND THAT'LL HELP US SORT OF KIND OF A NARROW THE CONVERSATION. IS IF YOU WOULD TAKE IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE AGREED TO AN AMENDMENT THAT SAYS. THAT -- DID. THAT UNDER THESE LOYALTY PROGRAMS THESE COMPANIES WOULD RESTRICT THE ALL SELLING OF INFORMATION GATHERED AS PART OF THE PROGRAM WOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT. ALL RIGHT I THINK IF THAT'S THE CASE I THINK THAT THAT HELPS US TREMENDOUSLY AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT I AM VERY GOOD. OUR ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AS AMENDED -- CENTER SIR ANYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS THE BILL'S PASSING AYE I WON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. IT'S GOING TO PASS. OKAY GOOD WELL THANK YOU SEE -- CREATIONS ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION.
