01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:23.038
SIMILARLY THE MISERY CAUSED BY

PERFECT BILLY WANTED BUT IT

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.362
ADDRESSES 5% OF WHAT WE WANT

BIG TOBACCO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.467
WE'RE IGNORING THE INTEREST OF

WHEREKIDS ARE SMOKING. THE

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.037
THREE EXEMPTIONS THAT WE

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.339
UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO PUT UP.

MANY OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:54.389

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:53.768

WHAT THE BILL DOES DO. IS THIS

A REALITY THIS ISN'T ABOUT NOT

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:55.569
LIKING BIG TOBACCO ARE NOT

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:58.205
LIKING ANYBODY ELSE. THIS IS

01:32:58.272 --> 01:33:00.374
ABOUT ELEVEN CALIFORNIA KIDS IN

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:01.242

THE CHAMBER. DR WEBER. IS TO

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.823
GET RECOGNITION DR WEBER YES MR

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.625
SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:20.861
IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN NINE

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.830
THREE AND I RISE BECAUSE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.065
OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GIVEN ALL THE

01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:25.499
REASONS WHY WE SHOULD BE

01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:26.968
STANDING FOR THIS CALL US

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.636
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE DEVASTATING

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.805
EFFECTS OF TOBACCO AND MOST OF

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:32.773
OUR LOVED ONES WHO HAVE PASSED

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.341
AWAY AND I'VE HAD A LOT WHO

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:36.010
HAVE. ALWAYS TELL ME THAT THEY

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:36.978
BEGAN AS A KID. THEY BEGAN WHEN

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:39.080
THEY WERE YOUNG. AND AS A

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:40.581
RESULT OF THAT THEY STRUGGLED

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:41.849
WITH THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.250
ACTUALLY GAVE THEIR LIFE AS A

01:33:43.317 --> 01:33:45.453
RESULT OF IT SO WE CAN SIT HERE

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:46.387
AND PRETEND THAT WE'RE

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:48.255
CONCERNED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:49.924
AFFECTING YOUNG PEOPLE AND IT'S

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.525
ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME WITH ALL

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:52.760
THE LEGISLATION THAT I PUT

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:55.262
FORTH IS ALWAYS ANOTHER ISSUE

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.497
THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING

01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:57.531
WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE

01:33:57.598 --> 01:33:59.467
THAT IS BEFORE US. SO I WOULD

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.102
ENCOURAGE US TO REALIZE THAT

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:02.636
YES THIS WORLD IS FILLED WITH

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:05.206
ISSUES AND AS WE IF WE'RE GOING

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:05.840
TO DEAL WITH THEM WE DEAL WITH

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.842
THEM ONE AT A TIME AND IT'S NOT

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:08.876
EASY TO DEAL WITH ANY OF THESE

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.078
ISSUES BUT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.947
ADDRESS THE ISSUE AS IT FACES

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:15.683
US. AND THIS IS GROWING THERE'S

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:16.417
NO QUESTION THAT TOBACCO WAS

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.185
LOSING YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE WHY

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:19.553
WOULD IT HAVE A CAMPAIGN ON HOW

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.856
UGLY TOBACCO WAS AND HOW PEOPLE

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.290
WHO LOOK AFTER THEY SMOKED AND

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:24.125
HOW THEY LOOK WITHOUT THEIR

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.793
LUNGS AND WITHOUT THEIR WITHOUT

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:26.794
THEIR THROATS AND ALL THOSE

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.462
THINGS AND SO AS A RESULT WE

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:30.064
WOULD NOT FIND THE INDUSTRY

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:31.465
TRYING TO ATTRACT THEM TO OTHER

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:33.134
THINGS. YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.935
THE FLAVORED TOBACCO IS NOT

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.070
SOMETHING THAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO

01:34:36.137 --> 01:34:37.505
YOUNG PEOPLE NOT THOSE WHO ARE

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:38.839
ALREADY ADDICTED BUT IT

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:40.241
PROVIDES A WAY TO DIP OF

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.643
INSTANCE I RISE IN SUPPORT OF

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:44.078
SEVEN NINE THREE. BUT I ALSO

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:46.213
RISE AS A PERSON WHO HAS SPENT

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.214
THE LAST FIFTY YEARS OF HER

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.583
LIFE LEARNING AND TEACHING

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:54.321
AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND I

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:56.023
AM INSULTED. IN THAT THE

01:34:56.090 --> 01:35:00.394
TOBACCO. WOULD MAKE. AN EFFORT

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:00.961
TO A BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:01.929
COUPLE. THE LATEST. IS A PART

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:04.799
OF AFTER AMERICAN. AND THAT'S

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:05.933
WHAT'S BEING STATED AND THAT

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.802
THIS IS A DISCRIMINATORY PIECE

01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:08.869
OF LEGISLATION AGAINST BLACK

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:10.638
PEOPLE. AND SO I'VE HAD PEOPLE

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:12.206
CALLING ME SAYING THIS IS

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:14.475
UNFAIR TO US IF IT'S SOMEONE

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.277
WANTS TO SAVE US AND OUR

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:18.979
CHILDREN AND FINALLY FINALLY

01:35:19.046 --> 01:35:22.416
FOCUS UPON AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:22.883
AND YOU CONSIDER THAT

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.418
DISCRIMINATORY. IN THAT CASE

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.219
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.353
SLAVERY ECAUSE ACTUALLY WAS

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.589
DISCRIMINATORY SINCE WE WERE

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:29.356
THE ONLY ONES IN SLAVES IN THIS

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.225
COUNTRY. AND YET YOU DECIDED

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.193
THAT IT WAS WORTH THAT'S

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.360
SOMETHING WE SHOULD GET RID OF

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:34.595
BECAUSE IT IS UNDESIRABLE AND

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:36.597
IT'S THERE'S NO BENEFITS. WHEN

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:37.998
I LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:40.167
TOBACCO IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:41.802
IT IS NOT A CULTURALY BACKED

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.337
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT I

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.538
HAVE READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.640
I'VE STUDIED ALL THE RESEARCH

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.809
WE'VE DONE THIS AS BLACK PEOPLE

01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:49.944
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN MID TO

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.278
LATE A CIGARETTE AND SOMEHOW I

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:53.380
KNOW THAT IT REPRESENTS THEIR

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:54.882
CULTURE. IT REPRESENTS WHO THEY

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:57.051
ARE. IT BUILDS UP THEIR VALUE

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:59.820
SYSTEM. IT GIVES THEM AN

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:01.689
IDENTITY AYE WE INSANE. NO THIS

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.424
IS WHAT WE USED TO CALL

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.759
WATERMELON POLITICS. AND IF

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.394
YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:08.295
THEN WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR%

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.331
COMMUNITY WHEN I WAS A KID IN

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:10.998
THE PROJECT TO WHAT HAPPENED IN

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.067
THE SOUTH. POLITICIANS AND

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:14.101
OTHERS WOULD COME TO OUR

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:15.503
COMMUNITY WHAT THE WHAT WHAT I

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.171
CAN FOR THE WATERMELON. AND

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:18.672
PASS THEM OUT AND TALKING TO

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.307
GET VOTES AND GET SUPPORT

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:22.042
WATERMELON POLITICS BUT YOU

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:25.513
NEVER SEE AGAIN. THIS IS ONE OF

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:26.547
THE MOST RACIST THING TO EVER

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.616
TALK ABOUT THAT BLACK PEOPLE

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.284
SOMEHOW DOUBLE LOVE MID TO LATE

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.453
CIGARETTES. AND IT'S A PART OF

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.888
OUR CULTURE AND IT'S GOING TO

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.823
DEMONISE US IT'S GOING TO HURT

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:38.659
OUR GRANDMOTHERS AND OLDER

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.193
PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.729
MIDDLE LATEST. I AM. AS A

01:36:41.795 --> 01:36:44.031
SCHOLAR AS A MEMBER OF THIS

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:45.533
HOUSE AS A PERSONAL JUST

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:47.001
REQUIRED ETHNIC STUDIES BUT

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:48.702
EVERY CSU GRADUATE IN THE

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:50.738
STATE. THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT

01:36:50.804 --> 01:36:52.439
BEEN ONE MINUTE TALKING ABOUT

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.141
AFRICAN AMERICAN CULTURE WOULD

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:58.946
HAVE THE AUDACITY. TO TELL ME

01:36:59.013 --> 01:36:59.613
THAT THIS IS BLACK. THAT IS

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:00.814
WHAT BLACK ARE ABOUT. NO THIS

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:02.750
IS WHAT RACIST ABOUT ONE OF MY

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:05.853
A DOLLAR ON BLUE AND POOR KIDS.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.588
A YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS

01:37:07.655 --> 01:37:08.956
IS WHAT THIS ISAND WE SHOULD

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.291
NOT CONFUSE IT SO IF YOU THINK

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:11.892
YOU'RE VOTING TO HELP BLACK

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:14.128
PEOPLE. DON'T DO THAT. VOTE

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:16.697
AGAINST A VOTE FOR THIS BILL.

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:17.665
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RACE

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.667
ISSUE. THIS IS AN ECONOMIC

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:22.536
ISSUE THAT HAS ALWAYS HELPED

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:24.004
PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND USE THEM

01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:26.840
FOR THE BENEFIT. SO I'M OUTRAGE

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:28.042
AS A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSEHOLD

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.610
WILL SUPPORT HIM I'LL REYES AS

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.812
A SCHOLAR THAT THEY WOULD USE

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:33.781
THIS TO TRY TO PRETEND THAT

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.282
THEY ARE HELPING BLACK PEOPLE

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.051
PROMOTING OUR CULTURE AND THEN

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.719
USE OUR FRIENDS AND OUR

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.187
MINISTERS AND OTHERS TO MAKE US

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:41.889
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SOME

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:43.657
DISCRIMINATION IN THIS. I SAID

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:45.125
IF THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING

01:38:05.512 --> 01:38:07.948
HABIT. THAT WOULD DEVASTATE THE

YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT'S ALWAYS

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:21.929
DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE CHOICE

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.698
WHETHER TO SPEAK AFTER DOCTOR

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:26.333
WEBER I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.203
FROM SAN DIEGO- BUT I'VE CHOSEN

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:31.038
TO FOR VERY PERSONAL REASONS.

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.239
MY MOM STARTED SMOKING WHEN SHE

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:34.942
WAS SIXTEEN. A LOT OF YOU KNOW

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:37.444
I LOST HER VERY EARLY SHE ENDED

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:38.445
UP WITH BREAST CANCER AT FORTY

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:41.515
TWO. AND THEN AFTER REMISSION

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:43.651
IT CAME BACK AS LUNG CANCER.

01:38:43.717 --> 01:38:46.887
SHE DIED OF LUNG CANCER AT

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:47.821
SIXTY TWO. AND THE ONLY THING

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:51.191
SHE ASKED ME IS TO MAKE SURE MY

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:53.260
KIDS NEVER SMOKED. IT SEEMS

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:57.331
LIKE SUCH A SIMPLE IDEA ISSUE

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:59.199
WITH ON HER DEATH BED BE SURE

01:38:59.266 --> 01:39:02.002
MY KIDS DON'T SMOKE SMOKING IS

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.972
GROSS THEY HEARD FROM EVERYBODY

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:07.274
FROM TE TIME THAT THEY WERE

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:09.043
BORN SHOULD BE EASY. BUT WHAT

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:10.244
MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:12.579
SAID WHEN YOU END UP HAVING AN

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.648
ESPECIALLY YOUNG BOYS BUT ALL

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:16.350
KIDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:19.620
SCHOOL. YOU REALIZE JUST HOW

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:22.723
MANY KIDS ARE DOING BETH. JUST

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.259
HOW AVAILABLE THESE VAPING

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.461
PRODUCTS ARE AND GUESS WHAT.

01:39:27.528 --> 01:39:29.430
IT'S NOT SO GROSS IT DOESN'T

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:32.032
SMELL SO GROSS IT DOESN'T TASTE

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:35.502
SO GROSS. SO THE PARENT. YOU

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:36.537
SPEND YOUR TIME TRYING TO

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.205
EXPLAIN TO YOUR KID WHY

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:39.807
SOMETHING THAT SOCIETY IS

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.342
SAYING THIS IS MUCH SAFER THAN

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:43.010
SMOKING THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:46.580
SAME. YOU TRY TO. CONVINCE THEM

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:47.648
THAT NOW GETTING HOOKED ON

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.750
NICOTINE IS THE SAME. YOU'RE

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:53.520
SETTING YOURSELF. UP FOR A

01:39:53.587 --> 01:39:54.621
LIFETIME OF DISEASE. I WISH

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:57.157
EVERYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER. HAD

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.459
A MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL

01:39:58.525 --> 01:40:01.261
AGE CHILDREN. TO JUST KNOW

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:04.732
EXACTLY HOW PREVALENT THIS IS.

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:07.301
I DIDN'T GET THE A THE PUSH IN

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:10.471
MY DISTRICT ABOUT THIS. BEING

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:11.071
SOMEHOW DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:12.940
AFRICAN AMERICANS. I GOTTA PUSH

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.274
ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATORY

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:16.443
AGAINST POOR PEOPLE. AND NOT TO

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:20.047
IS OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE I AGREED

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:21.248
WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:23.050
CENTRAL VALLEY THE EXCEPTIONS

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.652
IN THIS SHOULDN'T EXIST I THINK

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.522
WE SHOULD DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:33.560
THAT WE'RE COVERING ALL TOBACCO.

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.028
BUT WHAT'S DISCRIMINATORY

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:37.030
AGAINST POOR PEOPLE IS GETTING

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:39.466
THEM HOOKED. ON SMOKING AND NOT

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:41.468
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE. NOT

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:42.603
PROVIDING THE KIND OF

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:44.772
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ENSURE

01:40:44.838 --> 01:40:47.040
THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IS

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:47.608
HAPPENING TO THEM ESPECIALLY

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:50.811
POOR KIDS. SO I'D BE HAPPY TO

CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:53.680
AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:54.681
SOMETHING ABOUT ATTRACTING

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.150
YOUNG PEOPLE TO ANY KIND OF

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:59.086
SMOKING OR DRUGS. BUT YOU DON'T

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:01.054
SAY NO TO SOMETHING THAT'S

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:03.757
