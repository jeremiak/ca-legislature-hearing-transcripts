MANY OTHER COMMITTEES AS WELL.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.344
OVER HALF OF ALL A P. EYES ARE

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.947
ACTUALLY IMMIGRANTS. RIGHT IF

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.016
YOU LOOK AT THE API POPULATION

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:04.583
IN CALIFORNIA OVER HALF OR

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.751
ACTUALLY- IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.786
AND THEN YOU THINK THE REST YOU

THE FASTEST GROWING IMMIGRANT

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.093
GROUPS- AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.794
OF COURSE A LONG HISTORY OF

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:16.395
IMMIGRATION FROM MANY OTHER.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:19.832

CHILDREN. I THINK YOU KNOW

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.873
CERTAINLY THE ATMOSPHERE THAT'S

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.009
BEING GENERATED- AT THE FEDERAL

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.278
LEVEL BY THE CURRENT- PRESIDENT

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:35.848
HIS ADMINISTRATION- AND- THAT

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.883
IS NOT ONLY OF COURSE THROUGH

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.852

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:47.860

UNFORTUNATELY- ANTI IMMIGRANT

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.264
RHETORIC BY OTHERS IT IS QUITE

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.200
TROUBLING AND FACT AS WE ARE

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.335

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:05.844
WOULD POINT OUT THAT-

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:08.013
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS THE

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.049

COUNTRY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:16.055
ACTUALLY BLOOMBERG NEWS SAID

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.023
ONE OF ITS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.858

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:30.348
ALSO POVERTY ON THE OTHER HAND

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:30.849
HAVE OCCURRED AGAINST A

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.484

EQUITABLE MULTI ETHNIC REGION

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.433
THAT WILL LEAD THE NATION ON

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.034
IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BECAUSE

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:50.869
THAT IS ONE OF OUR GOALS AT THE

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:54.539
STATE AT THE REGION WE HAVE TO

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:55.140
UNDERSTAND THAT OUR STATE AND

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.641
OUR REGION WAS BUILT ON A

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.376
SYSTEM OF SETTLER COLONIALISM

00:22:58.443 --> 00:23:00.479
WHERE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WERE

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.046
REMOVED AND DISPLACED FROM

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:02.748

PERPETUAL ANGEL VIOLENCE AND

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.353
DISENFRANCHISEMENT. BUT ALSO

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:08.954
AIM TO MAINTAIN WHITE SOCIAL

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.491

TO RAISE THESE COMMUNITIES BUT

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:40.919
THERE'S ALSO MULTIPLE

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:41.453
COMMUNITIES OF INDIGENOUS

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.020
PEOPLE IN LA WHOSE HISTORIES

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:42.721
ARE EMBEDDED INTO THE FABRIC OF

AFTER MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE WAS

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:51.223
ACHIEVED FROM SPAIN IN EIGHTEEN

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.490

THEIR GRIP ON CONTROL AND THE

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CREATED HUGE

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.928
RANCHES IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAND

00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:58.964

THE TOP OF THE RACIAL

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:04.803

ON SAN PEDRO. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:18.683
EIGHT MEXICO CEDED CALIFORNIA

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.485
TO THE U. S. WITH THE SIGNING

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:21.052
OF THE TREATY OF GUADALUPE

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:24.556
HIDALGO AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

00:25:24.623 --> 00:25:26.491
END THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR-

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:30.528
TEAMS LIKE ME KEEP PLEASE.

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:31.162
THERE CAN WAR DIDN'T END WITH

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:32.797
THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY IN

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.532
THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY I

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:35.000
ALLEN- WITH A MASSIVE

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.835
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AS ANGLOS

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.037
CAME INTO THE STATE CHINESE

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:40.939
IMMIGRANTS JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:42.941
AND IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO. AN

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.843
ALLEY GREW AND PROSPERED

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.945
BECAUSE THE ANGLO WOULD LEAD AT

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.713
THE TIME IT DIVESTED CALIFORNIA

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.615
THE MEXICAN AMERICANS OF THEIR

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:52.517
LAND AND POLITICAL POWER. AND

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:54.586
USE LAWS SOCIAL PRACTICES AND

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.588
RACIAL VIOLENCE TO EXCLUDE AND

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.857
CATEGORIZE NON WHITE PEOPLE AS

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:02.794
OTHERS. NOW POPULATION

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.496
CONTINUED TO GROW AFTER THE

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:05.130
NINETEEN HUNDREDS PART OF THE

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.564
GROWTH WAS DUE IN PART TO

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:07.198
IMMIGRATION FROM MEXICO PEOPLE

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.833
WHO ARE FLEEING THE MEXICAN

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.835
REVOLUTION. BUT IT WAS ALSO DUE

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.671
TO A GREAT INTERNAL MIGRATION

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.839
WHITE ETHNICS COMING FROM OTHER

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:16.708
AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES AS

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:18.643
WELL AS BLACK AMERICANS COMING

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.779
FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE US SO

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:22.681
PEOPLE WERE PULLED INTO. LA

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:24.783
ONCE AGAIN LIKE WE SEE TODAY BY

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.618
THE PROMISE OF THE AMERICAN

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:27.185
DREAM EXPANDING EMPLOYMENT

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:30.622
OPPORTUNITIES- ESPECIALLY

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.222
MANUFACTURING GERALD DURING

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:33.058
AFTER I WORLD WAR TWO ABUNDANT

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.859
SPACE THERE WAS ONCE ABUNDANT

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:38.897
SPACE IN LOS ANGELES. AND THE

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:42.834
PROMISE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. BY

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.836
THE MID. TWENTIETH CENTURY ONLY

00:26:44.903 --> 00:26:45.503
WAS MAJORITY WHITE BUT WAS ALSO

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:45.971
A SPRAWLING METROPOLIS

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:46.604
COMPRISED OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.606
AFRICAN AMERICANS LONG SETTLED

00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:49.240
MEXICAN ASIAN AMERICAN PEOPLE

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:51.009
JEWISH AMERICANS AND SOMEONE.

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.978
OF COURSE ALL OF THESE GROUPS

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:54.813
WERE LIVING UNDER A SYSTEM OF

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:55.347
WHITE SUPREMACY THAT WAS

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:58.650
ENFORCED BY SOCIAL PRACTICES A

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:00.618
WEB OF LIES AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:01.219
CITY STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.921
THAT RESULTED IN RICK RACIAL

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.622
RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION.

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:05.256
SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MENTIONED

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:06.891
EARLIER THE IMPACT OF RED

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:08.793
LINING WHICH CANNOT BE

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.628
OVERSTATED IN THE CASE OF LOS

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:11.196
ANGELES. AND THIS OF COURSE

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:13.131
RESULTED IN TWO MAJOR WAVES OF

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:16.768
CIVIL UNREST AN UPRISING IN THE

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:17.302
SIXTIES AND THE NINETEEN

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.070
NINETIES OF COURSE DESPITE

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:19.704
THESE BARRIERS COMMUNITIES OF

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.807
COLOR IN LA CONTINUE TO THRIVE.

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:24.743
BUT THIS IS STORICA CONTEXT

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:25.377
COMBINED WITH THIS CONTEMPORARY

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:28.747
MOMENT. THE POLITICS OF FEAR

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:30.982
AND A BOLD ATTACK ON IMMIGRANT

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:32.917
COMMUNITIES. SHAPES THE

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:35.020
INTEGRATION OF NEWER IMMIGRANTS

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:38.723
TO LA THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.061
AND THIS BRINGS ME TO ONE OF

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:43.595
THE CENTRAL CONCERNS WHEN

00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:46.931
THINKING ABOUT. IMMIGRANT

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:47.465
COMMUNITY TODAY IS WHAT IS

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:48.900
IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION. SO WHEN

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:49.401
WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRANT

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.036
INTEGRATION WE SAY THAT IT IS

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:51.603
AN INTENTIONAL PROCESS THAT

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:52.971
INCLUDES THE NEEDS OF IMMIGRANT

00:27:53.038 --> 00:27:54.739
COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.808
IT'S A GOVERNMENT POLICIES AT

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:57.409
THE CITY REGIONAL AND STATE

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:57.976
LEVEL. I THINK I HAVE TWENTY

00:27:58.043 --> 00:28:01.079
MINUTES. IS THAT MY TWENTY

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:04.916
MINUTES UP. OKAY I'M WE C.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:05.483
IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION IS A

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.185
DYNAMIC RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:09.087
IN WHICH NEW COMERS AND THE

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:10.989
RECEIVING SOCIETY BOTH HAVE A

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:12.757
RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTEGRATION

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:13.391
AND BOTH BENEFIT AS THEY WORK

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.126
TOGETHER TO BUILD SAFE DRIVING

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.162
AND CONNECTED COMMUNITIES SO

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.064
OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.865
IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION PEOPLE

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:22.934
THINK THE INTEGRATION IS SOLELY

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:24.736
BASED ON WHAT IMMIGRANTS

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.738
THEMSELVES ARE DOING BUT THAT'S

00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:27.238
NOT ACTUALLY HOW INTO

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:29.007
IMMIGRANTS FULLY INTEGRATE INTO

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:31.042
SOCIETY IT IS A RECIPROCAL. TWO

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:32.844
WAY PROCESS INTEGRATION ALSO

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.879
DEPENDS ON WHAT ALL OF YOU ARE

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:35.413
DOING ON THE GROUND THE

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.048
POLICIES THAT YOU ARE ALL

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:39.117
MAKING AND WE CAN THINK OF

00:28:39.184 --> 00:28:40.785
IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION AND A

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:41.386
COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:44.756
ECONOMIC MOBILITY THE ABILITY

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:45.390
TO FULLY ENGAGE IN THE ECONOMY

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.225
WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT. ALL OF

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:48.860
YOU AND SENATOR PAN CENTER JOEL

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:49.494
MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS WORTH

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.831
WARMTH OF WELCOME THE EXTENT TO

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:53.465
WHICH IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOMED

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:56.835
BY THE RECEDING SOCIETY AND

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.770
CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THE ABILITY

00:28:58.837 --> 00:28:59.270
FOR IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR

00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:00.905
DESCENDANTS TO FULLY ENGAGE

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:41.766
THEIR CHILDREN. AND

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:43.467
ACCUMULATING ASSETS FOR

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.436
EMERGENCIES SO IT'S NOT ONLY

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:46.037
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND RACIAL

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:49.240
ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN. OUTCOMES

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:51.242
BUT ALSO AS SENATOR MITCHELL

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.909

WAS AT ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZED.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.485
AND SO FORTH SO SOME OF THE

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:02.086
CONCERNS THAT FEDERAL POLICY

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:03.688
CHANGES OF ROT BUT I ALSO MADE

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:07.458
A HANDY LIST HERE CHANGE THE

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:09.260
SIDE FOR ME PLEASE KEITH. I'M

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.362
HERE ARE TEN THINGS THAT

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.431
SCHOLARS ACTIVIST COMMUNITY

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:15.266
ORGANIZATIONS IMMIGRANT SERVING

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:15.933
ORGANIZATIONS ARE REALLY REALLY

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.635
WORRIED ABOUT AT THE FEDERAL

00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:19.604
POLICY LEVEL. WE'RE VERY

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.539
CONCERNED ABOUT NEW ATTACKS ON

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.441
LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE THOSE

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.276
ELIGIBLE FOR NATURALIZATION

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:25.843

CHANGES THE PUBLIC CHARGE WHICH

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.380
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:29.947
DISCUSSING LATER. THIS OF

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:31.549
COURSE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.250
ELIGIBLE NATURALIZER IMMIGRANTS

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:35.252
TO OBTAIN LEGAL RESIDENCY IF

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:35.886
THEY USE SOME BENEFITS. THERE'S

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.688
ALSO SIGNIFICANT ATTEMPTS TO

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:41.359
RESTRICT IMMIGRATION VIA LEGAL

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:43.461
MEANS BY REDUCING THE ASYLUM

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:45.529
LEASE A CEILING INCREASING FEES

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:47.465
MAKING VISA APPLICANTS SHOW

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:49.266
THAT THEY CAN AFFORD HEALTHCARE

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:49.834
THIS WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.636
AFFECT. IMMIGRANTS OF COLOR

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.904

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:59.276
REUNIFICATION IN THE UNITED

00:37:59.343 --> 00:37:59.877
STATES AND OF COURSE POLICIES

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:00.311
AROUND DETENTION AND

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:03.648
DEPORTATION. CENSUS TWENTY

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.616
TWENTY IS ALSO A PARTICULAR

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:06.283
CONCERN WE NEED EVERYBODY TO BE

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.618
COUNTED SO THAT DATA CAN BE

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:11.389
USED TO ADDRESS INEQUALITIES.

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:11.922
AND I THINK MANY OF MY

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:13.391
COLLEAGUES WILL ADDRESS SOME OF

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.058
THESE ISSUES TODAY BUT I'M ALSO

MOBILITY. GOING FORWARD. THE

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.762
POINT IS THAT IMMIGRANTS ARE

STRATEGIES FOR CREATING WELCOME

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.384
AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.453
SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED AND

MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS TO ENTER

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:54.151
PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY HELP FROM

PARTICULAR IMMIGRANTS FROM

STATES PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:40.264
THAT THIS WILL

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.699
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT OF

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.567
COURSE THE API COMMUNITY AND

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.569
THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHO

OVERWHELMINGLY APPLY FOR FAMILY

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:49.673
REUNIFICATION IN THE U. S.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:55.713
THERE ARE. ALSO ATTEMPTS TO OR

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:56.280
THERE AN AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:59.783
MADE. THAT THE TRUMP

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.685
ADMINISTRATION IS DECREASING

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:02.319
AND THE REFUGEE CEILING SO THE

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:04.021
RARE REFUGEE CEILING IS ONCE

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:07.625
AGAIN DECREASING BY HALF WHICH

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.627
IS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.762
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY AND SO

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:12.329
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:13.898
DECREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:15.733
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM IS THAT

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:16.400
THEY WILL ALLOW INTO THE UNITED

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:17.835
STATES. THE CAP IS THAT

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.737
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FOR NEXT YEAR

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.705
YEAH I WAS REGULARLY- THE

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.874
LATTER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:26.010
WAS AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND AND

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:29.747
SO THIS IS ARE YOU SAID. EIGHTY

00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:30.314
THOUSAND UNDER THE PREVIOUS

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.916
ADMINISTRATION AND IT HAS BEEN

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:32.483
REDUCED TO EIGHTEEN AS THE

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:36.053
ALLEN EIGHT YEAH Q. AND SO THIS

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.823
IS. AGAIN ATTEMPTS TO PREVENT

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.759
PEOPLE FROM ENTERING IN TWO AT

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:45.796
THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS BEEN

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.463
HARD FOR MANY OF US TO KEEP UP

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.032
I HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THE

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.934
CHANGES ARE CONSTANT THE

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.635
CHANGES ARE INCREASINGLY-

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:55.806
PUNITIVE EXACTLY. EVEN IT IS IT

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:59.643
NOT ONLY AFFECTS THOSE WHO ARE

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.779
TRYING TO AT MY GREAT THE US

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:02.379
BUT THOSE WERE ALREADY HERE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.248
AGAIN PUBLIC CHARGES ON MY ****

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.849
COLLEAGUES DISCUSS LATER ON IS

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.952
AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE WHO CAN

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:13.624
POTENTIALLY BECOME US CITIZENS-

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:14.191
SO THOSE ARE ALSO CONCERNS

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:15.759
THESE NEW ATTACKS ON. THE

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:19.763
ELIGIBLE TO NATURALIZE IN WHO

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.665
ARE ALREADY HERE IN THE US.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.034
WELL THE QUESTION ABOVE JUST

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:24.635
LOOKING AT THIS CHART THE YOU

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.003
HAD I I'VE SO IF WE WERE

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.637
ACTUALLY CHATTING ABOUT THE HOW

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.072
FAST HE WAS LOOKING AT THOSE

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.740
FOLKS WHO MIGRATED HERE MORE

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:30.341
THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO VERSUS

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.076
THOSE. WHO COME IN THE LAST TEN

00:43:32.142 --> 00:43:33.978
YEARS IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.646
MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:36.213
TWO OF THEM ONE OF THEM. IS

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.650
THAT YOU KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:40.284
FOLKS FROM MAX. DOES DROP FROM

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.721
42% TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- AND

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.355
THEN THE OTHER ONE IS THE FACT

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:46.023
THAT THE- THE- NUMBER OF FOLKS

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.758
FROM CHINA JUMP FROM 3% TO

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.292
ELEVEN. CAN YOU COMMENT A

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.860
LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THE-

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.929
GEOPOLITICS BEHIND THOSE TWO.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:55.799
THOSE TWO CHEFS. YEAH THAT'S- A

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:59.937
GREAT QUESTION. SO THE SO THE

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.772
TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA NEAR

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.841
TRENDS. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:05.876
STATES MORE GENERALLY RATES OF

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:06.510
MEXICAN MIGRATION TO THE US ARE

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:08.112
ACTUALLY WHAT SCHOLARS SAY IT

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:11.849
WE CALL WE SAY THAT NET ZERO

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:12.483
BECAUSE THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:14.184
MEXICANS LEAVING THE US THAT

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.953
ARE ARRIVING. AND THE MEXICAN

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.988
IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN THE

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:21.825
UNITED STATES IS LONG SETTLED-

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:23.761
ON AVERAGE. OF MEXICAN

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:24.395
IMMIGRANTS IN THE US HAVE BEEN

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:27.831
HERE TEN YEARS OR LONGER AND

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.867
THESE SHIFTS ACTUALLY. THE MAC

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:30.367
THE DECLINE IN MEXICAN

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:32.002
IMMIGRATION THE BEST ACTUALLY

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:33.971
STARTED RIGHT BEFORE THE GREAT

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.739
RECESSION SO THIS HAS BEEN

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.741
GOING ON FOR DECADES SO DESPITE

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:38.308
WHAT YOU HEAR DONALD TRUMP'S

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.743
THOUSAND ABOUT MEXICAN

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.812
IMMIGRATION. MEXICAN

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:43.847
IMMIGRATION IS AT HISTORIC LOWS

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.916
TO THE UNITED STATES SOME OF

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:46.483
THIS- DYNAMICS THAT HAVE

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.185
OCCURRED IN THE U. S. THE LABOR

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:50.220
MARKET FOR EXAMPLE THAT MANY

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:51.755
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IMMIGRATION

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:52.389
FROM MEXICO WOULD PICK BACK UP

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.924
AFTER THE RECESSION. ENDED BUT

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.759
THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.761
THERE'S MULTIPLE DYNAMICS WITH

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.763
IN MEXICO ITSELF THE SOME OF

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:00.364
THE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT

00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.932
IMMIGRATION IS THAT. IT'S NOT

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:02.566
JUST AFFECTED BY WHAT'S GOING

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.836
ON IN THE UNITED STATES BUT

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:06.470
ALSO BY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:07.938
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. AND IT'S

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.840
REALLY AFFECTED BY THE

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:10.441
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:12.109
COUNTRIES. SO DYNAMICS IN

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:15.746
MEXICO SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:16.346
DECREASE IN THE BIRTH RATE THE

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:17.915
BIRTH RATE IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:21.819
IS. A REPLACEMENT LEVEL TWO

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:25.856
CHILDREN PER FAMILY. I'M WHICH

00:45:25.923 --> 00:45:30.194
REDUCES THE QUARTER THE SIZE OF

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.995
THE POPULATION. WHO IS FACING A

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:37.935
G. CATION PERTINENTES. S. R. IN

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:43.807
MEXICO ITSELF. SO MOST OF THE.

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:44.341
LATINO MIGRATION IS COMING

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:45.909
FROM- CENTRAL AMERICA CENTRAL

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:47.778
AMERICAN REFUGEES WHO ARE. AND

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:48.412
MIGRATING BECAUSE OF POLITICAL

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:51.815
AND ECONOMIC TURMOIL ROT BY US.

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:52.449
INTERVENTION IN THOSE COUNTRIES

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.884
A LONG HISTORY OF US

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:55.752
INTERVENTION WE HAVE SOME POSTS

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.754
ON OUR BLOG IT'S YES I I'D THAT

00:45:57.821 --> 00:45:58.355
DISCUSS THIS MORE FULLY IF

00:45:58.422 --> 00:45:59.957
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN READING

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.126
MORE ABOUT THOSE. MOST OF THE

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.961
GROWTH IN THE LATINO POPULATION

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.796
IN THE US IS COMING FROM A

00:46:05.863 --> 00:46:06.330
GROWTH IN THE CHILDREN OF

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:09.766
IMMIGRANTS NOT FROM IMMIGRATION

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.835
WHEREAS MOST OF THE GROWTH IN

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:12.436
THE ASIAN POPULATION IS COMING

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:16.006
FROM. IMMIGRATION. SPECIFICALLY

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:17.841
TALK THE DYNAMICS OF SUCH AN

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.776
INCREASE THE FOLKS FROM CHINA-

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.079
IS THAT PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:24.014
AS A CHINESE GOVERNMENT LOOSEN

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:24.581
RESTRICTIONS ON LEAVING THE

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:26.183
COUNTRY. SOME OF THE INCREASE

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.352
IN IMMIGRATION FROM CHINA IS

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.154
THE WAY THAT WE SELECT

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.889
IMMIGRANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:32.389
THE WAY THAT OUR FEDERAL

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.091
IMMIGRATION POLICY SELECTS

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:36.093
IMMIGRANTS. WERE THE PRIMARY

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.162
WAY TO M. MIGRATE TO THE UNITED

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:41.965
STATES LAWFULLY IS VIA-

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.901
EMPLOYMENT OR FAMILY

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.869
REUNIFICATION. AND OUR

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.938
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES- FOR

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:50.140
MIGRATION TYPICALLY. PRIVILEGE

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:55.913
OF THOSE WHO ARE- WHO HAVE WHAT.

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.315
DEFINE AS HIGH SKILLS AND SO

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.150
THAT'S THE LAX IMMIGRANTS FROM

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.785
PARTICULAR COUNTRIES SUCH AS

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:02.419
HIGH SKILLED INDIAN IMMIGRANTS

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.154
OR INDIANS FROM I'M SORRY

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:06.056
IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA SOME OF

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:08.192
IT HAS TO DO WITH OF COURSE

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.960
CHANGING DYNAMICS IN CHINA BUT

00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:11.895
SOME OF IT ALSO HAS TO DO. WITH

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:14.031
FAMILY REUNIFICATION AS WELL SO

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:16.033
AS MIGRATION FROM CHINA I

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:18.202
INCREASE AFTER IMMIGRATION LAWS

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:20.304
CHANGED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.072
THIS IS WHEN WE SAW THE STATE

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:23.974
THIS LARGE INCREASE IN

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:24.541
IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.143
STATES AFTER FEDERAL

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.978
IMMIGRATION LAW CHANGED. IN

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.080
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE- MUCH OF

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:33.884
THAT INCREASE IS DUE TO FAMILY

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:36.186
REUNIFICATION POLICIES AND ALSO

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:42.092
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES. BUT I WILL

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:44.194
SAY I'M SORRY WHAT MANY PEOPLE

00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:45.996
ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:46.430
THE FASTEST GROWING

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:48.031
UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN THE

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:50.100
COUNTRY OUR ASIAN ORIGIN AS

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:54.137
WELL SO SOME OF- THIS IS ALSO

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.240
AGAIN A STEREO TYPE THAT PEOPLE

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.242
HAVE ABOUT WHO IS A DOCUMENTED

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:58.775
IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY AND-

00:47:58.842 --> 00:48:02.212
COMMUNITIES. ASH INTERESTING

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.248
NEPHEW MADE ONE OF THE POINTS I

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:06.016
WAS GONNA ASK ABOUT THAT- AND I

00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:08.218
ALSO MAKE NOTES IT JUST AN

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:11.989
OBSERVATION THAT- EVEN AS- THE

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:13.924
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:16.260
DROPPED OUR- REFUGEE ACCEPTANCE

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.328
TO RECORD LOWS WE ALSO PURSUING

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.130
POLICIES TO GENERATE MORE

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:22.032
REFUGEES AROUND THE WORLD. MOST

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:24.067
RECENTLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST SO

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:28.105
WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT THAT. AREA

00:48:28.171 --> 00:48:30.440
THE SO I GUESS THE OTHER

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:34.344
QUESTION I HAD AND. AND I GUESS

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:34.978
THE ONE SLIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:38.081
IN FRONT OF US BUT YOU ABOUT-

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:38.548
WHERE PEOPLE DIFFERENT

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.217
INDUSTRIES A FOURTH SO- I GUESS

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.419
AN OBSERVATION WOULD BE IS THAT

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:44.288
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:46.256
OF OUR STATE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:48.025
IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:48.625
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION WOULD

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:52.162
ACTUALLY BE DROPPING. RIGHT

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:52.629
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.097
IMMIGRATION THAT WE ARE.

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:56.099
CONTINUING OUR GROWTH AND IN

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.035
FACT I KNOW THIS IS A WORKFORCE

00:48:58.101 --> 00:48:58.568
COMMISSION BUT YOU KNOW WE

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.203
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT JOSH UP

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.272
FUTURE SHORTAGES. AND OUR WORK

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:04.207
FORCE AND VARIETY DIFFERENT

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:06.343
SECTORS. I CAN YOU SPEAK TO-

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:10.113
THE ROLE OF IMMIGRATION IN

TERMS OF SUSTAINING OUR

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:16.019
ECONOMY- IN TERMS OF WHERE. AND

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:16.586
WE OFTEN DO TALK ABOUT MANY

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:20.357
IMMIGRANTS. DO END UP THEY'LL

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:20.957
START OFF AND LOW WAGE AND-

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:24.027
SERVICE SECTOR POSITIONS BUT

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:24.661
ACTUALLY IF WHAT HAPPENS BOTH

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:26.463
THEIR OWN PROGRESSION AND UNDER

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.432
FAMILY AS WELL. AND IT IS IT'S

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:30.400
BASICALLY PART OF THE ENGINE

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.302
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONTINUING

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:34.204
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND IF WE

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:34.838

RHETORIC AGAINST IMMIGRATION IS

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.387
BASED ON A FIXED PIE- WELL

THEY'RE COMPETING TO TAKING

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.325
JOBS AWAY FROM US WHAT THEY'RE

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.427
NOT TALKING ABOUT IS HOW

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:10.994
IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY INCREASE

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.329
THE SIZE OF THE PIE. THAT'S

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:14.297

THE DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.599
SIMPLY COMPEL THAT WE ARE VERY

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.701
INTENTIONAL IN THINKING ABOUT

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.736
HOW WE DO OR DON'T SERVE THE

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.771
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. SO AS WAS

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.740
MENTIONED EARLIER. TWENTIES

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:32.675

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.744
MILLION AND A QUARTER OF THAT

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:38.648
POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN ONE

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.817
OF THE CRITICAL FACTS THAT WE

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.952
OPERATE WITHIN IN THINKING

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.721
ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR

00:58:44.787 --> 00:58:45.255
POLICIES ARE THAT ONE TWO

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:46.956
CHILDREN 50% OF CHILDREN IN

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.958
CALIFORNIA. HAVE A FOREIGN BORN

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.994
PARENT AND ONCE AGAIN AS WAS

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.762
MENTIONED EARLIER THE VAST

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:54.664
MAJORITY OF THOSE PARENTS TO

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.599
HAVE SOME SORT OF LEGAL STATUS.

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.233
BUT WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS OF THE

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.068

BEING UNDOCUMENTED BECAUSE OF

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.678

IMPLEMENTED. TRYING TO FOCUS

01:25:58.486 --> 01:25:59.020
MOST OF IRAQ'S AROUND PUBLIC

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.522

THAT WE- CAN. FIND PAST

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:06.528
PROGRAMS BUT IF PEOPLE ARE

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:10.331
FEARFUL OF PARTAKING. THEN

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:10.832
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET

DID HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH US

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.447
SOME OF THE COUNTY FOLKS ARE.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.716
AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO TRACK

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:30.485
IN SOME SENSES WE DON'T ASK

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:32.554
PEOPLE WHAT'S YOUR IMMIGRATION

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.255
STATUS AND SO FORTH TO SELL.

BUT IS ARE THERE IS THE

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:38.326
DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT AND

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:38.927
WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AND

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.695
TRYING DEVELOPED AT LEAST SOME.

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:44.399
MECHANISM THERE'S TO TRY TO GET

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:44.999
SOME IDEA OF. HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:26:45.066 --> 01:26:48.503
ARE. NOT RENEWING SAYING THEY

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:50.538
WANT OFF OF PUBLIC PROGRAMS

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:52.373
BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THE

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.007
PUBLIC CHARGE AT THE ONE THAT

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:54.609
PRIDE HARDEST AS PEOPLE WHO

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.578
WOULD QUALIFY TO NEVER SIGN UP

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.246
BECAUSE THERE D. YOU KNOW IT'S

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.248
TOUGH HOW DO YOU. TRACK THAT.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:00.915
BUT EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:02.784
END WHO SAY WELL I'M REALLY

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.819
AFRAID OF PUBLIC CHART SO I GOT

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.588
TURNED DOWN I DON'T I'M OUT OF

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.489
TOWN FRESH ON TURNING AWAY. SO

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.491
FOR THIS IS THERE SOME EFFORT

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.560
TO TRY TO- WORKING WITH THE

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:13.161
COUNTY IS GOING TO BE ON THE

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:14.662
FRONT LINES TO TRY TO. GET A

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.598
SENSE OF HOW TO WHAT DEGREE

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:17.198
THAT'S HAPPENING AT SO I HEAR

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:20.435
ANECDOTALLY. BUT THE MORE

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.069
SYSTEMATICALLY TRY TO TRACK ARE

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:26.274
WE HAVING. ARE PEOPLE BASICALLY

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:26.874
TURNING DOWN SERVICES THAT WE

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:32.513
ARE FUNDING. SO THAT THE

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.682
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL

01:27:34.749 --> 01:27:36.584
SERVICES HAS BEEN WORKING

01:27:36.651 --> 01:27:37.118
CLOSELY WITH THE WITH THE

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:40.521
NUMBER OF PARTNERS INCLUDING

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:42.490
INCLUDING THE COUNTIES. TO TRY

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.492
TO MONITOR THE PARTICIPATION

01:27:44.559 --> 01:27:46.561
RATE OF IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.930
AND- IF YOU LOOK AT AT SOME OF

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.632
THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:52.433
BROUGHT FORWARD WHERE- THE

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.702
COUNTIES IN THE STATE HAVE

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.838
ATTESTED TO THE TO THE DROPPING

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:58.506
OF PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.375
PROGRAMS THAT ARE. PARTICULARLY

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:01.009
SENSITIVE TO THE PUBLIC CHARGE

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:04.379
RULE SO THERE IS A PARTNERSHIP

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.581
THERE AND I AND I AND I WANT TO

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:07.115
KNOW ON SENATOR MITCHELL

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:10.652
MENTIONED EARLIER ALSO THAT THE

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:14.589
NEED FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.156
WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:18.793
THAT IS. PARTNERSHIPS WITH.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.327
TRUSTED MESSENGER AND THE

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:20.862
STATE'S INVESTMENT IN AND OUT

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.864
REACH AS AS RENEE MENTIONED AND

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:26.467
IN THE LEGAL SERVICES. AND SO

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.469
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I THINK

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:29.103
WE'RE TRYING TO BRING ALL OF

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.605
THOSE TABLES TOGETHER TO HAVE

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.674
THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHERE

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.676
ARE WE SEEING. THE DROP IN

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.611
PARTICIPATION WHAT IS THE

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:40.548
EFFECTIVE- MESSAGING FOR

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.182
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND HOW DO

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.784
WE ACTUALLY EFFECTIVELY REACH

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:44.719
THOSE POPULATIONS I APPRECIATE

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.487
IT BECAUSE I THINK PART OF THE

01:28:46.554 --> 01:28:48.489
REASON WHY COLLECTED DATA IS SO

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:48.990
WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:52.493
RESEMBLE WHICH- WHERE DO I

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.696
TARGET OUR EFFORTS TO HAVE THE

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:56.497
BIG. IMPACT WHERE WHERE IS THE-

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:58.599
WE'RE OUT REACH FAILING. WERE

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:00.535
MORE SUCCESSFUL AT AND SO. AND

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.704
SO HOW DO WE- PROVIDE MORE

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.839
GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.774
FOCUS OUR EFFORTS- BECAUSE

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.676
UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.611
UNLIMITED RESOURCES SO. WE CAN

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.480
MAKE MAXIMUM USE OUR RESOURCES.

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.649
AND THEN RIGHT I AS FAR AS

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:16.484
DEPART HEALTHCARE SERVICES

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:17.018
OBVIOUSLY IS. THE BUDGET

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:18.553
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.688
HUMAN SERVICES VERY INTERESTED

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.590
IN BOTH DEPARTMENTS HERE- ALSO

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:26.494
EDUCATION EVEN THOUGH IT'S-

01:29:26.561 --> 01:29:28.696
BUT- SO. IN TERMS OF SO YOU

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:30.832
KNOW WE PASS. AND AT THE END D.

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.934
WE'RE FINDING. COVERAGE WHERE

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:40.742
PEOPLE DOCUMENT IN. I'LL BE OFF

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.510
PREVIOUSLY ZERO EIGHTEEN NOW UP

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:46.681
TO TWENTY SIX. HOW IN ANY

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:47.281
TAUGHT YOU TOUCH A LITTLE BIT

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:50.752
ON THIS. I'M STILL CONCERNED

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:51.352
THAT YEAH WE HAVE A GUIDELINE

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:52.987
THAT PEOPLE MAY STILL BE AFRAID

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:53.521
TO APPLY BECAUSE OF PUBLIC

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.989
CHARGE IN FACT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:55.556
YOU'VE SEEN ANY OF THAT WITH

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:56.858
RESTRICTED MEDIC COW BECAUSE AT

01:29:56.924 --> 01:29:57.458
LEAST WITH YEAH. SO I KNOW YOU

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:58.826
KNOW TAKE THOSE AND ROLLED INTO

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.928
FULL SCOPE BUT- I DON'T KNOW IF

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.930
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO ARE

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:05.066
DROPPING OFF AND THEN THE OTHER

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:06.868
THING IS THAT BECAUSE AT ONE

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:08.669
BIG CHALLENGES PUBLIC CHARGES A

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.605
BIT OF A MOVING TARGET IN PART

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:12.607
THE REASON IT'S A MOVING TARGET

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:13.207
IS ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE PUSHING

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:14.809
BACK AGAINST. SO TED NIELSEN

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.944
OFFICIALLY IS THIS TO TAKE

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:17.545
PLACE IN THE FIFTEENTH THERE'S

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:18.513
OF SUCCESSFUL LAWSUITS CETERA

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.113
AT SO CAN YOU MAYBE ALSO SPEAK

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.617
TO HOW THE PART COMMUNICATING

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.652
WITH THE COUNTY SO ON THE FRONT

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:25.253
LINES TO ENROLLMENT. OF THAT

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:26.954
THEY JUST BE VERY FRANK WE HAD

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:30.691
A PROBLEM BEFORE WHERE STATE

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:31.325
POLICY WAS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:34.595
ON DHAKA. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:36.764
MEDIC HAL BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:42.670
A LETTER SENT COUNTY. IS

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:46.641
INDICATING THAT AND TO RECALL.

01:30:46.707 --> 01:30:48.709
HOW COMPLICATED THE- OUR

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:50.812
SYSTEMS ARE DE ELIGIBILITY

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:51.412
COMPUTER ACTUALLY REJECTED THE

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.613
DHAKA EVEN THE OUR POLICY AND

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:53.181
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WORK

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:53.781
AROUND BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:54.615
DIRECTION FROM THE AGENCY

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:55.183
COUNTIES DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:56.617
WE'RE DOING IT AND SO PEOPLE

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:57.251
WHO ARE ON DHAKA BEFORE WERE

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:57.752
APPLYING EVEN WHEN THEY

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:58.986
QUALIFIED THEY WERE TURNED AWAY

01:30:59.053 --> 01:30:59.520
BY CALIPHATE BECAUSE THERE

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.088
WASN'T SO I I'M JUST BRING THAT

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:02.957
UP BECAUSE I'M GONNA TALK ASK

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.959
ABOUT HOUSES COMMUNICATION PATH

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.894
GOING BETWEEN. D. C. S. ANDY

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:08.696
COUNTIES ON THE FRONT LINES SO

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:09.363
THAT THE PERSON FROM THEM TO BE

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:10.798
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISS

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.900
COMMUNICATING TO PEOPLE- AND-

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.969
BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE HEAR THAT

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.804
MESSAGE FROM THEIR ELIGIBILITY

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:17.438
WORKER THEY WALK AWAY TO THINK-

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:20.808
I'M QUALIFIED HUESO- SO CAN YOU

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.877
SPEAK TO HOWARD THE BEING SURE

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:24.946
THAT THAT COMMUNICATIONS

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.948
HAPPENING- THAT'S HAPPENING.

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:30.685
AND WITH THIS FREQUENCY- THE

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.620
SPECIALLY WITH POTENTIAL

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:38.659
CHANGES THOSE THINGS ARE MOVING.

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:39.260
AND WOW DE KLERK HOLLY IS THAT

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:42.830
LIVED TO BE SURE TO. IN THE END

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.866
THE- IS APPLYING- DOESN'T. YOU

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.868
KNOW THINK THAT THEY GET THE

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.936
YEAH. AND AS SELF THE SPEED

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:51.105
THAT. SO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:52.907
ABOUT THE DROP OFF SO ONE OF

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:53.541
THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN DOING

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.775
IS CHECKING IN WITH OUR COUNTY

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:55.309
PARTNERS AS WELL AS ALSO

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.711
LOOKING AT OUR OWN DATA. WE

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.679
HAVE NOT IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:00.681
OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WE

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:02.817
HAVE NOT SEEN ANY APPRECIABLE

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.919
OKAY I DECLINES IN A MOMENT WE

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:06.921
HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD THAT THERE

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:08.723
ARE ACTUAL INCREASES IN THEIR

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.791
HOME AND GIVEN. THAT IN

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.793
PARTICULAR BUT FOR THAT-

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.629
POPULATION THAT'LL BE SUBJECT

WHICH IS- THE COMMITTED RAPE

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.476
AND ORGANIZATION THAT SPEAKS

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:38.611

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:44.417
THE KIND OF THINGS. I'LL GIVE

01:58:44.484 --> 01:58:46.352
EXAMPLE. THE CAMERA LADY FROM

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:52.725
DETENTION. CENTER SHE'S SIX

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:53.226

WASN'T REALLY HAPPY SHE WAS

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:05.137
RESISTING HELP BECAUSE OF HER

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:05.805
STICK MOTHER FEAR. THE FACT WE

HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:09.742
PUBLIC CONSTITUTE. POLICE

NOT FRIEND HERE EITHER BUT AT

01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:16.682
LEAST. SO. BECAUSE OF THAT WE

DON'T HAVE NO TRUST. SO WE ARE

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:22.555
STILL DEALING M. BUT THE REASON

01:59:22.622 --> 01:59:23.222
I BROUGHT THIS EXAMPLE IS I'LL

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:24.624

COUNTRIES TO GET HERE. AND THE

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:41.040
FIRST THING SHE ASK IS WHAT DO

I GET MY FOOD. DO NOT ASK ANY

01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.944
URGENT BUT THE FOOD WAS

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:46.646
SOMETHING WHAT. CREATE A

01:59:46.712 --> 01:59:48.714
BELONGINGNESS SHIP SAFE THAT'S

01:59:48.781 --> 01:59:50.616
WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.752
COMPLEX TO UNDERSTAND WHO WE

01:59:52.818 --> 01:59:54.620

01:59:54.687 --> 01:59:58.357

THE- OUTCOMES WE EXPECTED TO

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:20.780
BE. SO WE ALSO HAVE OTHER WAY

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:26.452
TREATING THIS. AN OPERATION LOS

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:50.476
AMONG AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN- SO

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.545
WE'LL HAVE TO COME OUT WITH THE

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:53.079
TREATMENTS I'M AN AFRICAN

02:00:53.145 --> 02:00:54.714
CALLED ISSUE LATELY BEEN

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.682
WORKING HARD MY COLLEAGUE DR

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.551
SAVANT THE WHO IS A- THE

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.519
OUTSTANDING RESEARCHER HOW DO

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.555
WE ADDRESS THIS JOB IS. SO WE

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:04.390
HAD TO COME UP WITH THE

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:04.991
TREATMENT IT'S CALLED- CACHO

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:08.394
LOSS THERAPY MODEL WE HAVE A

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:12.431
LOT OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:13.065
PROTECT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE

02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:18.504
TREATMENT BUT. I DON'T FEEL

02:01:18.571 --> 02:01:19.138
LIKE NONE OF US WORKING FOR THE

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.406
IMMIGRANT COMING FOR A CERTAIN

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:21.073
CULTURE THAT STUDY HASN'T BEEN

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.708
AT LEAST NOT TESTED THAT SO WE

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:24.477
CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA. TO

02:01:24.543 --> 02:01:26.412
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOSS

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.414

AFRICAN AMERICAN FOR FOUR

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.820
HUNDRED YEARS. IT'S A LOSS OF

02:01:36.922 --> 02:01:38.791
WAS STRUGGLING MORE SO FOR US

02:01:38.858 --> 02:01:40.726
FOR IMMIGRANTS COULD BE WHEN WE

ETHIOPIA LADY. SO WE HAVE TO DO

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:47.033
A MULTIPLE LAYER OF

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:50.503
DISCRIMINATION AS WELL. THAT'S

02:01:50.569 --> 02:01:52.571
THE REASON WE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.507

COPING MECHANISM FROM A

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:16.529
CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS

02:02:16.595 --> 02:02:17.096

DEPENDENCY SYSTEM AND A NUMBER

02:06:06.825 --> 02:06:07.393
OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND ALTHOUGH

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:09.194
THEIR EXPERIENCES VERY ALMOST

02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:10.996
ALL UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:14.800
QUALIFY FOR SOME FORM OF RELIEF.

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:15.401
WELL ALMOST ALL UNDOCUMENTED

02:06:15.467 --> 02:06:17.102
FOSTER YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:18.837
QUALIFY FOR SOME AVENUES TO

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:20.839
LEGAL STATUS THERE'S NO

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:21.373
MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.042
UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH.

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:25.044
RECEIVE THE IMMIGRATION

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:25.644
ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED TO

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:27.279
TAP ACCESS THAT RELIEF AND THIS

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:29.248
IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BECAUSE

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:31.116
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO LEAVE

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:32.785
FOSTER CARE WITHOUT OBTAINING

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:34.787
LEGAL STATUS BE SUBSTANTIAL

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:35.321
BARRIERS AS THEY TRY TO

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:37.156
TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD AND

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:38.824
THESE BARRIERS INCLUDE THE

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:40.859
INABILITY TO LEGALLY WORK. THEY

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:41.460
CAN'T ACCESS MANY FORMS OF

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:43.128
FINANCIAL AID AND THEY FACE THE

02:06:43.195 --> 02:06:45.097
CONSTANT FEAR OF BEING DETAINED

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:47.166
BY ICE. SO TO ENSURE THAT THIS

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:48.867
DOESN'T HAPPEN FOSTER YOUTH

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:51.036
NEED ASSISTANCE FIRST ASSESSING

02:06:51.103 --> 02:06:53.038
OUR IMMIGRATION NEEDS AND ALSO

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:53.639
BEING LINKED WITH IMMIGRATION

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:55.007
REPRESENTATION THE CRITICAL

02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:57.042
FIRST STEP TO DETERMINING

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.676
WHETHER OR NOT A FOSTER YOUTH

02:06:57.743 --> 02:06:59.178
NEEDS IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE.

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:00.913
IS DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:02.781
THAT FOSTER USES UNDOCUMENTED

02:07:02.848 --> 02:07:03.382
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO STEP

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:05.117
PROCESS. FIRST WE NEED TO

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:07.152
DETERMINE WHETHER THE CHILD IS

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:08.787
BORN IN THE UNITED STATES AND

02:07:08.854 --> 02:07:09.355
IF NOT WE NEED TO DETERMINE

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:10.990
WHETHER THAT CHILD HAS ALREADY

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.058
RECEIVED STATUS. IN OBTAINING A

02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:13.592
COPY OF THE CHILD'S BIRTH

02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:15.094
CERTIFICATE EARLY ON IN THE

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:16.895
DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS IT'S

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.931
ESSENTIAL TO LINKING THE CHILD

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:19.565
WITH IMMIGRATION REPRESENTATION

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:22.968
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. CALIFORNIA

02:07:23.035 --> 02:07:26.772
LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT THE COURT

02:07:26.839 --> 02:07:27.406
ORDER THAT A PERSON TO MAKE IT

02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:27.940
BE PRODUCED IF THE COURT.

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:28.874
EITHER DETERMINES THAT

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:29.508
REUNIFICATION SERVICES TO THE

02:07:29.575 --> 02:07:31.110
PARENTS AREN'T GOING TO BE

02:07:31.176 --> 02:07:32.778
OFFERED OR IF THE COURT

02:07:32.845 --> 02:07:33.379
TERMINATES THOSE REUNIFICATION

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.280
SERVICES. BUT FOR MANY CHILDREN

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:37.249
THIS DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:40.919
REUNIFICATION SERVICES. DOESN'T

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:44.823
HAPPEN FOR MANY YEARS IF AT ALL.

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:46.892
AND IN OUR EXPERIENCE EVEN WHEN

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:47.526
THE JUDGE DOES MAKE THE ORDER

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.328
REQUIRING THE PRODUCTION OF THE

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:50.996
BIRTH CERTIFICATE THERE ISN'T

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:53.098

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:53.599
TO ENSURE THAT THE BIRTH

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:54.933
CERTIFICATE IS OBTAINED. SO IN

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.469
LOS ANGELES COUNTY MANY JUDGES

02:07:57.536 --> 02:07:58.771

DISPOSITION REPORT BUT AGAIN AT

02:08:03.075 --> 02:08:05.077
THIS PRACTICE ISN'T ALWAYS

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:06.945
FOLLOWED. AND EVEN IF THE BIRTH

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:07.513

IMMIGRATION STATUS MAY REMAIN

02:08:09.815 --> 02:08:15.020

GOING ON WITH THE CHILD'S

IMMIGRATION CASE IF THE CHILD

BEHALF OF THE CHILD. AND WHEN

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.901
THE CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THAT

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:29.468
PARENT OR CAREGIVER IF THEY

MAKE SURE IT'S MORE PREVENTIVE

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:52.123

02:23:56.127 --> 02:23:58.296
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN TO THEM THIS

02:23:58.363 --> 02:23:59.897
IS HOW WE CULTURE PROSPECT IS

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:03.968

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.006
OF LITTLE THINGS MIGHT BE

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:10.241
NOTHING BUT M. IS A LOT TO US

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:11.909
BECAUSE THEY SAID EARLY SARAH

02:24:11.976 --> 02:24:13.978
DETAINEES ARRIVED WHEN THEY

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:16.114
ARRIVE HERE A LITTLE FOOD MEANS

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:17.982
A LOT TO THEM LISTEN I'VE BEEN

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:26.057
HUNGRY. IT'S ASSISTS MALES

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:29.894
BELONGINGNESS WE HAVE TO BE. IT

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.829
WAS STRENGTHENED IDENTITY

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:32.463
WITHOUT- SEPARATION THAT'S WHAT

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:37.835
I'M ASKING THANK YOU. AT LEAST

02:24:37.902 --> 02:24:38.436
FOR SO ALEX JULY SEEKING TO

02:24:38.503 --> 02:24:39.037
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:39.971
FOR NEXT YEAR'S STARTING ONE OF

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:40.605
THEM IS HOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA

02:24:40.671 --> 02:24:42.240
LEADERS ENSURE THAT THEY CLOSE

02:24:42.306 --> 02:24:42.707
TO THREE MILLION LEGAL

02:24:42.774 --> 02:24:44.008
PERMANENT RESIDENTS ARE READY

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:44.542
TO BECOME CITIZENS BECOME

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:45.843
CITIZENS FOR TO PULL TWO MAIN

02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:46.444
REASONS ONE IS IN REGARDS TO

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:48.279
THE POLITICAL- REALITY ONCE YOU

02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:50.214
BECOME A CITIZEN YOU HAVE THAT

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:51.883
YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I'M

02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:52.550
SO THAT CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:54.318
BUT THEN TO ALSO RELATED TO THE

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:56.421
BUDGET EVE FOLKS BECOME CITIZEN

02:24:56.487 --> 02:24:57.989
THEM THAT THE STATE WILL GET

02:24:58.056 --> 02:25:00.124
REIMBURSED REGARDS TO THE

02:25:00.191 --> 02:25:00.725
WHATEVER SERVICES THAT THEY

02:25:00.792 --> 02:25:02.427
THAT THEY CAN DO FOR US IS- WE

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:04.062
YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:05.930
THAT WE CONVEYED IS A STRATEGY

02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:08.066
TO ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT MAYBE

02:25:08.132 --> 02:25:10.101
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIFTH WE OUGHT

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:12.303
TO HAVE A GOAL OF NATURALIZING

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.138
ONE MILLION- THE PRIMARY

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:16.140
RESIDENCE. AND THAT CAN CHANGE

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:16.674
DRAMATICALLY THE POLITICAL

02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:18.309
LANDSCAPE ACROSS THE STATE BUT

02:25:18.376 --> 02:25:20.144
THEN ALSO- ISOLATES OUR BUDGET

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:22.146
THE SECOND ASPECT IS HOW YOU

02:25:22.213 --> 02:25:23.948
KNOW WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:24.615
GOVERNOR- AND THE LIKE IS THAT

02:25:24.682 --> 02:25:26.317
YOU'RE GOING TO IMMIGRANT A

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:29.987
SPECIFIC AREA OF WORK- BUT I

02:25:30.054 --> 02:25:31.956
THINK WE ALSO SEE HOW IS THAT

02:25:32.023 --> 02:25:32.557
WE CAN DO THAT LEVEL OF THE

02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:34.392
SAME LEVEL OF WORK THAT WE DO

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:36.160
IN IN CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN.

02:25:36.227 --> 02:25:38.162
ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:39.997
GOVERNOR GO ABROAD AND SO LIKE

02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:41.933
WE ARE DOING THIS GREAT WORKING

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:42.600
WHEN I CHAMPION WE WANT TO MAKE

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:44.335
SURE THAT WE ALSO ELEVATE THAT

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.237
THE SAME LEVEL OF CLIMATE

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.939
CHANGE WITH IMMIGRATION BECAUSE

02:25:48.005 --> 02:25:48.606
THE TWO OF THEM ARE ESSENTIALLY

02:25:48.673 --> 02:25:50.341
THE SAME THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE

02:25:50.408 --> 02:25:52.176
THERE ACTUALLY FLEEING THOSE

02:25:52.243 --> 02:25:54.078
COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF CLIMATE

02:25:54.145 --> 02:25:56.314
CHANGE SO HOW DO WE TIE THE TWO

02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:58.082
THINGS TO TOGETHER. TO THE

02:25:58.149 --> 02:25:59.951
BALLPARK BET THAT THAT THAT-

02:26:00.017 --> 02:26:02.153
SOME OF YOU HAVE I'M LASTLY AS

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:02.753
AT LEAST FOR US IT'S LIKE HOW

02:26:02.820 --> 02:26:04.122
DO WE CREATE SYSTEMS IN PLACE

02:26:04.188 --> 02:26:06.257
THAT- OUR I SEEKING TO MAKE

02:26:06.324 --> 02:26:08.259
SURE THAT THIS OUR AGENCIES ARE

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:10.361
INCLUSIVE THAT THERE IS A CO I

02:26:10.428 --> 02:26:12.296
COME DRIVEN DATA THAT WE CAN

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:16.167
SHOW LIKE IF WE DO A THAT MEANS

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:18.102
THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE A BETTER

02:26:18.169 --> 02:26:19.971
OUTCOME EITHER A JOB WHAT

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:20.538

02:52:57.934 --> 02:52:58.434
IN PART BECAUSE WE GET TO

02:52:58.501 --> 02:52:59.969
NETWORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES.

THE PUBLIC CHARGE FOR- HOWEVER

02:53:04.373 --> 02:53:06.142
WE ARE SEEING FAMILIES THAT ARE

02:53:06.209 --> 02:53:07.910
BEING IMPACTED- THEY'RE

02:53:07.977 --> 02:53:09.746
REFUSING TO COME TO THE

02:53:10.446 --> 02:53:11.981

02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:13.583
IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEM

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:14.150

02:53:33.736 --> 02:53:35.605
