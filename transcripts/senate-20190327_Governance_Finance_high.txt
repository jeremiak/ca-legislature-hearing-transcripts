AT MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST FOR ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR WHICH WILL TAKE ACTION ON ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. CURRENTLY ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR WE HAVE ITEMS SIX SB THREE SEVENTY NINE ITEM SEVEN SB THREE EIGHTY IN ITEM. EIGHT SB THREE EIGHTY ONE WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE -- ITEMS THREE SB TWO EIGHTY SEVEN TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR -- IN EIGHT THE TIME OF ACTION FOR THE COULD SINK COUNTER WE'RE GONNA SEE THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO AND I WANT. TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK CENTER NIELSEN FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON THAT BILL. MEMBERS AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WITH THAT COULD BE A MOVING TO OUR FIRST BILL WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR HILL FOR ALL OF HIS WORK ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS. IMPORTANT ISSUE HE'S BRINGING FORWARD YET AGAIN THIS YEAR THIS IS SB TWO NINETY FOUR SENATOR HILL. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER -- TO PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING SB TWO NINETY FOUR WILL AID NONPROFIT AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY EXPANDING THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSESS PROPERTY BUT ANNUALLY. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL HELP TO CHARITIES IN OUR STATE FROM DAY ONE ONE OF WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. IF YOU ARE ALL AWARE FOR OF OUT OF THE FIVE LEAST AFFORDABLE RENTAL MARKETS NATIONWIDE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. NON PROFITS THAT DO NOT RECEIVE ANY TAX CREDITS OR LOANS FROM THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE A CAP. PLACED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX THAT MAY BE EXEMPTED ANNUALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS THAT DO RECEIVE TAX CREDITS ARE LOANS FROM H. C. D. HAVE NO LIMIT. ON THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES THAT CAN BE EXEMPTED AND NO MINIMUM PERCENTAGE REQUIRED OF TENANTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A PRORATED. PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES EXEMPTED ADDITIONALLY AT THE REQUEST OF THE SAN MATEO COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE. IN SB TWO NINETY FOUR WE LOWERED THE THRESHOLD FOR A NONPROFIT TO RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX BENEFIT. THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER IN MY DISTRICT RECENTLY WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE A FORTY EIGHT UNIT APARTMENT COMPLEX. ALL WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS AT A COST OF TWENTY TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUILDING HAD EXISTING TENANTS AND BECAUSE OF HOW TIGHT THE EXPENSIVE IT IT AND EXPENSE OF THE BAY AREA RENTAL MRKET IS THEY DIDN'T WANT TO IMMEDIATELY A VICTOR ALL OF THE TENNIS THAT WERE NOT LOW INCOME. AND THEY PAY THE PRICE THEY RECEIVED A TAX BILL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY. THE SENATE IF COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE CALLED MY OFFICE AND REQUESTED THAT THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER AND OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED CHARITIES GET A PRO RATED PORTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES EXEMPTED. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AT LEAST AGREED WITH THEM IT IS ONLY FAIR AND IT AKES SENSE. NOW I'M APPALLED THAT THE ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION TOOK A LATE OPPOSED POSITION ON THIS BILL. FRANKLY THESE THE THESE FOLKS ARE BOOKKEEPERS NOT POLICY MAKERS THEIR JOB IS TO ASSESS PROPERTY IN IN FAIRLY APPLY THE LAWS THAT WE CREATE IF THEY WANT TO BE BOOKED IF THEY WANT TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS. IF THEY WANT TO TAKE. THE POLICY POSITIONS THAN THEY SHOULD GET THEMSELVES ELECTED TO A POLICY MAKING BOARD OR BODY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I HAVE -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER HELLO -- WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE CENTER HILL STANDS ON THAT ISSUE SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND WILL OPEN IT UP FOR FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL MISS MARTIN FORCE OR SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RAND MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION MOST PEOPLE KNOW H. UP AS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF CARE AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH HIV IN THE WORLD. WITH ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION PATIENTS WORLDWIDE WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- HF HAS BECOME A MAJOR HOUSING PROVIDER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH HOPES TO EXTEND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE -- RECOGNIZING THAT HOUSING IS PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THE PEOPLE WITH HIV AND OTHER MANAGEABLE MEDICAL CONDITIONS FACE WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET PEOPLE INTO DECENT HOUSING. OUT OF THEIR CARS OFF OF PEOPLE'S COUCHES AND DEFINITELY OFF THE STREET WHERE THEY COULD RECEIVE MEDICAL CARE -- AND LIVE IN A DECENT ENVIRONMENT I'M IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE OPENED UP SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE UNITS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BY GOING INTO -- HOTELS AND MOTELS THAT HAVE HAVE BEEN RUN DOWN SPENDING UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT TO RE HAVE THEM TURN THEM INTO DECENT HOUSING AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES. ON WHAT WE HAVE IN THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE UNITS WE HAVE FAR EXCEEDED THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP AND PROPERTY VALUATION THAT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS -- WE ARE HERE DOING THINGS THAT -- THAT HELP ALL THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA -- AND WE THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD BE HELPFUL TO US IN TERMS OF TAKING SOME OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OFF.

WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO NINETY FOUR BY SENATOR HELL WE WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS THIS YEAR -- AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS TO ENCOURAGE NON PROFITS TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I WE THINK THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT WHILE THE STATE IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS. AND ESPECIALLY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WHERE HOUSING PRICES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH -- THIS BILL AIDS NONPROFITS AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES BY INCREASING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FROM TWENTY MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. WE FEEL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO PRESERVE AND ASSIST THE EFFORTS OF NONPROFITS LIKE THE SAINT FRANCIS CENTER IN REDWOOD CITY WHICH PROVIDES NON PUBLICLY FINANCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO EXTREMELY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. LOWERING THE REQUIRED PERCENTAGE OF LOW INCOME TENANTS AND PRO RATING THE EXEMPTION BASED ON LOW INCOME TENNESSEE WHAT -- ALLEVIATE DISPLACEMENT THAT CAN RESULT WHEN A CHARITY PURCHASES THE BUILDING WITH EXISTING TENANTS AS WAS RECENTLY THE CASE WITH THE ST FRANCIS CENTER. TO CENTER THAT CENTER HELP MENTION. AND WOULD ALLOW THEM TO USE THESE FUNDS TO HELP MORE FAMILIES SECURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ORDER SUPPORT OF SB JENNY.

THANK YOU VERYMUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR BILL FOR THE CALL FOR THE QUESTION OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. THE ASSESSOR'S CLAIM IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE WERE ABUSES AND THAT'S WHY. THIS WAS ESTABLISHED AS A AND AND WE MADE CHANGES TO IT PRIOR TO THAT THERE WAS A 20% REQUIREMENT FOR A LOW INCOME WE ARE NOW BRINGING THAT 250%. AND SO WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT GOING AS FAR AS HISTORICALLY IT HAD BEEN -- THE IDEA OF FRAUD AT THE REQUEST OF THE ASSESSORS IN THE PREVIOUS -- ITERATION OF THIS LEGISLATION INCREASING THE CAP -- THEY REQUIRED UP FORM FILLED OUT TO BE FILLED OUT A WELFARE EXEMPTION SUPPLEMENTAL AFFIDAVIT OF HOUSING THAT -- NOW IS REQUIRED OF ALL OF THOSE NON PROFITS TO FILL OUT AT THEIR REQUEST IN A IN THE UNDER THE PENALTY OF PERJURY THEY SIGN TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY. THE AMOUNT OF LOW INCOME TENANTS THERE ARE HOW MUCH THEY WERE -- NUMBER PROPORTIONS IN THE HOUSEHOLD THE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE RENT THAT CAN BE CHARGED ACTUAL RENT CHARGE THROUGH THERE IS AT THAT THE ASSESSORS REQUEST THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE EXEMPTION. THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF THE TOWARD IF THEY FEEL THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION SOMEWHERE THEY CAN GO IN AND AUDIT THOSE -- NON PROFITS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTING RESPONSIBLY AND IT AND ACCORDING TO LAW SO WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY REQUESTED HISTORICALLY IN THE PAST THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INCREASED HOUSING. AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NONPROFITS THAT USED THEIR FUNDS RAISED THROUGH THEIR FUND RAISING CAN PROVIDE THAT HOUSING WITHOUT A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX BILL FROM THEIR COUNTY ASSESSOR.

THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR MCGUIRE SANDERS -- BELLINGER COTTO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY. I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT SB. THREE SIXTY FOUR A PROBLEM THAT IS CURRENTLY PLAGUING CALIFORNIA'S OR AMOUNT OF VETERANS WHO ARE HOMELESS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX HOMELESS VETERANS ACCORDING TO ALMOST 30%. OF THE NATION'S TOTAL HOMELESS VETERANS POPULATION. VETERANS OF SACRIFICE FOR OUR COUNTRY AND IN RETURN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. THERE'S NO SINGLE SOLUTION THAT IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS OVERNIGHT REASONS FOR THE LARGE NUMBERS OF HOMELESS VETERANS ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY COMPLEX. TO THE BIGGEST FACTORS THOUGH ARE THE EXTREME SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LIVABLE INCOME. SB THREE SIXTY FOUR COMES TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS OF VETERANS FACED BY DOING THE FOLLOWING FIRST SB THREE SIXTY FOUR CAPS THE PROPERTY TAXES ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF AN HONORABLY DISCHARGED VETERAN. OVER HE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE AS YOU KNOW THESE THE THE TREASURER -- TAX COLLECTOR IN EACH COUNTY CAN RAISE THAT PROPERTY TAX UP 2% OF BASE BASED ON THAT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER PRICE INDEX SECOND IT EXEMPTS PROPERTY TAXES ON ALL IN THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE -- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MY DISTRICT AS YOU KNOW -- MY DISTRICT VERY CLOSE TO CAMP PENDLETON AND MANY NONPROFITS THAT EXIST OUT THERE TO PROVIDE FREE HOMES THERE SPECIALLY BUILT FOR THESE VETERANS TO DO THOUGH THE WHITE HALL WAYS THE WHOLE CASE. TO GET THEM INTO BETTER TO GET HIM INTO A SHOWER IF THEY'RE DOUBLE OR TRIPLE AMPUTEES BUT THE ONE THING THE LIVES OF THOSE HOMES THAT THEY GET. THE BENEFICIARY OF IS A PROPERTY TAXES AND MANY OF THEM CAN'T WORK ON THE SITE TENS OF THE GET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AREN'T SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THEM TO STAY. IN THEIR HOMES. TWELVE OTHER STATES ALREADY HONOR THEIR VETERANS WITH FULL PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA BE THE NEXT TO DO SO SB THREE SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES A BASIC STEP IN HELPING OUR VETERAN COMMUNITY. BY EXPANDING THE CURRENT PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION AND CURRENT -- REACH OF THE LAW CALIFORNIA IS HONORING THE SACRIFICES OF OUR VETERANS AND PROVIDED THEM A WAY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES THIS BILL IS A REAP INVEST BEFORE -- FOR WHICH PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER SOME VERY GRATEFUL WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE THIS TIME.

THANK YOUGOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAD TODAY I'M PRESENTING ON SB. FOUR ONE THREE A DISTRICTS PACIFIC BELL THAT WOULD MODIFY THE ELECTION SCHEDULE FOR THE SAN GBRIEL BASIN WATER QUALITY AUTHORITY. THE AUTHORITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTING. GROUNDWATER TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN THE SAN GABRIEL BASIN. IT IS GOVERNED BY SEVEN MEMBERS. TO INCLUDING LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND PREVIOUSLY CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS WERE HELD AN ODD EVEN I'M SORRY ON ODD NUMBERED YEARS AND THE AUTHORITY BOARD ELECTION WAS HELD ON EVEN NUMBERED YEARS. HOWEVER RECENT CHANGES HAVE COST CITIES AND MY DISTRICT TO CHANGE TO EVEN NUMBER YEARS IT GETS A LITTLE CONFUSING HOWEVER. NOW WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN THE CITY ELECTIONS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS CAUSING SOME CONFUSION. AND UNDER EXISTING LAW THE AUTHORITY MUST HOLD A SPECIAL ELECTION TO FILL BOARD VACANCIES. AND CONSIDERABLE TIME AND COST AS EXTENDED. SB FOUR ONE THREE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY STARRING THE AUTHORITY'S BOARD ELECTION AND CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS. AND ADDING. TO THE UPDATING. IN UPDATING PROCEDURES FOR FILLING A VACANCY TO ELIMINATE SPECIAL ACTIONS IN CASES RECEDE AS ONLY THEY CAN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE BOARD DISCUSSED THESE CHANGES TO THE PUBLIC. WITH -- WITH WORKSHOPS IN HEARINGS AND UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED A POSITION SUPPORTING THEM AFTER HEARING OPPOSITION FROM THE PUBLIC SO ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL JUST REMINDS THE ELECTION PROCESS. TO ENSURE WE DON'T SPEND MONEY ON SPECIAL ACTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR AND I'M SORRY LET ME INTRODUCE MY GUESTS HERE WHO WILL BE ALSO TESTIFYING RANDY. SHOULDER MAN AND HE'S THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ENGINEERING FOR THE SAN GABRIEL BASIN WATER QUALITY AUTHORITY AT THE FLOOR. THANK YOU CENTER. GOOD MORNING.

OPERABLE UNITS THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP -- WE REPORT ON A SEMI ANNUAL BASIS ON THE STATUS OF THAT CLEAN UP. TO THE STATE BOARD AND THE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD -- THIS BILL WOULD ALSO A CONSOLIDATE THAT INTO ONE REPORT ANNUALLY WHICH WE ALREADY DO -- SO IN ADDITION -- TO HELPING OUR ELECTIONS WITH THE CITY'S MAKING THAT. MORE OF A EASY PROCESS FOR THE ALL THE CITY CENTRE VAULTS SINCE WE HAVE TO GO TO OUTSIDE EACH CITY DURING EACH ELECTION STYLE CYCLE GET THE NOMINATIONS AND GO BACK TO THEM HOW DO RESOLUTIONS FOR THE THE VOTES AFTER THE FACT -- THIS BILL WOULD REALLY SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS OF YOURS OR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

OKAY THE ROLE OPEN -- SENATOR -- MCGUIRE WILL BE BACK IS AN EDUCATION COMMITTEE VOTING AND HE'LL BE BACK SHORTLY SO -- THIS IS SB -- FOUR ONE FOUR OF SMALL SYSTEM WATER QUALITY AUTHORITY. AND SIR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU SENATOR BELL AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT pSMALL SYSTEM WATER THIRTY ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. HAS IDENTIFIED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEM STATEWIDE THAT CHRONICALLY FAILED TO SERVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE THE SYSTEMS LACK THE FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS ONGOING CONTAMINATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. NECESSARY TO OPERATE A HIGH FUNCTIONING WATER SYSTEM. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL RURAL SYSTEMS SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TOO MANY OF WHICH ARE IN MY DISTRICT. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IS LONG OVERDUE. ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS TURN ON THE TAP AND CANNOT DRINK THE WATER. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED MANY LAWS AND ADDRESSED. ADDRESS SOME ELEMENTS OF THE WATER ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE INCLUDING CAPITAL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSOLIDATION WHEN AN ANCHOR TENANT. AGENCY IS NEARBY. HOWEVER LASTING CHANGES CHANGES TO THE UNDERLYING GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF FAILING COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IS NEEDED TO CREATE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS. TO ADDRESSING PROBLEMS WERE NEARLY NEARBY ANCHOR AGENCIES ARE NOT SUITABLE AND WE'RE ECONOMIC SCALE IS REQUIRED TO HAVE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS. SB FOUR ONE FOUR PROPOSES TO MERGE THE SMALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS INTO A LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. ACCESS TO STATE BACKED CAPITAL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STREAMLINED MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS AND ENHANCED FINANCIAL CAPACITY. SB FOUR ONE FOUR WOULD COMPLEMENT EXISTING STATE WATER BOARD CONSOLIDATION POWER INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY IMPLEMENTED. IT IS A NEW TOOL IN THE TO A TOOL BOX. LAST YEAR MY ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIFTY PASSED THIS COMMITTEE AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY AND LAUGH GO TO MAKE THE BILL EVEN STRONGER. SENATE BILL FOUR ONE FOUR IS A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARDS PROVIDING A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE DRINKING WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OUR DANIEL COATS AND THE EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT -- AND DANIELLE BLANCHET FROM THE CALIFORNIA MINUTES MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND UNDERSTAND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME OF US BUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE CORRECT YES THAT IS CORRECT THE SPEAKERS IN FAVOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB FOUR FOURTEEN TODAY I'M DANIEL COATS WITH EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. A WATER WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER PROVIDER THAT SERVES EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AS AN ORGANIZATION EASTERN HAS DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH CONSOLIDATING RIPARIAN SYSTEMS. WITH FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SEVERE CONTAMINATION AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WHILE THE STATE BOARD HAS THE POWER TO CONSOLIDATE SYSTEMS THEIR STORY IS CONSTRAINED WHEN THERE IS NO VIABLE RECEIVING AGENCY SB FOR FOURTEEN ADDRESSES THIS BY ALLOWING CHRONICALLY UNDER PERFORMING SYSTEMS RE EMERGED. THROUGH A STEP BY STEP PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIES DEFINES TIMELINE INTO A MORE ROBUST AND FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM. THE PROCESS UTILIZES QUALIFIED APPOINTED ADMINISTRATORS TO FORM THE MARK MORE COMPETENT SUCCESSOR AGENCIES. AND AND IT'S IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE LOCAL LASKO PROCESS. SB FOURTEEN FOR FOURTEEN PROVIDES A TOOL TO THE STATE BOARD THAT WE BELIEVE ADDRESSES. BOTH THE NEAR TERM NEED FOR INTERVENTION AND THE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE OF CONFERENCE REFORM. WE APPRECIATE THE GUIDANCE OF COMMITTEE STAFF. AN ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE WATER BOARD AND THOSE OTHERS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY THE SENATOR. WHO WORKED WITH US TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND FLEXIBILITY THE BILL? AND ALLOWING IT TO SERVE AS A TOOL IN ADDRESSING THE SAFE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE BELIEVE SB FOUR FOURTEEN WILL ULTIMATELY HELP INSURE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. HAVE SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER ON A DAILY BASIS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE A FOUR FOUR FOURTEEN THANK YOU -- OTHERS SPEAKERS YEAH DANIEL BLASTED HIDING WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THANKYOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY WE ARE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SB. FOUR FOURTEEN AS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL -- HELP -- AT BRING THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO A LARGE PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA THE CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE IT -- AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR IN A CO SPONSOR AS BEFORE FOURTEEN SEEKS O BRIDGET AND AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE STATE'S CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY. I'M SETTING UP A UNIQUE PROCESS FOR CONSOLIDATION THAT WHILE COMPLIMENTARY DOES NOT MERE EXISTING AUTHORITIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FOR THAT WE BELIEVE THAT A LOCALLY CONTROLLED PUBLIC PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG LASTING GOOD GOVERNANCE. CUSTOMERS CAN IN FULL AND SHOULD FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS RELATED TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SB FOUR FOURTEEN ENTRANCE FUNDAMENTAL STEPS THAT ENSURE COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE A VOICE IN THE FUTURE OF THEIR WATER SUPPLY. FROM ENGAGEMENT WITH COUNTY LAUGH GO TO REPRESENTATION ON A LOCALLY ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SECOND IT INCLUDES FIRM DEADLINES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS HAVING A DEFINITIVE TIMELINE IS ESSENTIAL WHEN THE STATE BOARD IMPOSES DEADLINES TO THEIR EXISTING MANDATORY CONSOLIDATION PROCESS. THEY WORK AND WE RECOGNIZE IT WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL HOWEVER WE FEEL IT'S A PRUDENT INVESTMENT TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED THROUGH OTHER MEANS -- EVEN WITH THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT THE STATE BOARD HAS TO CONSOLIDATE THERE STILL ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT SB. FOUR FOURTEEN PROVIDES ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX IT IS NOT MEANT TO SUPERSEDE OTHER AUTHORITIES. AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- TO RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD EVER MAKE THAT EXPLICIT THAT IT IS JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX BUT A VERY IMPORTANT -- ONE THE TIME IS NOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE SB FOR FOURTEEN PROVIDE THIS IS DATEABLE PATH FORWARD TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND WE WERE ACTUALLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE.

YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT GOING BANKRUPT AND HAVING ADMINISTRATOR POINTED IT'S NOT WHAT ANYBODY WANTS IN SOME OF THESE WATER SYSTEMS. DON'T NEED AN ADMINISTRATOR THEY NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS VERY CLEAR AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATOR FUNCTION. HAD THAT THAT THE BOARD HAS MORE -- ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHEN THAT ADMINISTRATOR FUNCTION IS APPROPRIATE. AND BY WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES BUT WE CAN TALK TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT THAT AND WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE MA'AM FOR A GROUP OF YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD NOW LIKE TO WELCOME THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSE FIRST AND LASSEN ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING.

GLASCOFF THOSE MAY BE POSTED COULD PLEASE ADVANCED MICROPHONE THIS TIME LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO BE RECEIVED ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE ALSO WOULD WORK ON THE MOTION. THE MOTION I CENTER TARA WE DO HAVE A QUESTION BY A CENTER ABOUT CENTERVILLE. I I I I I I AGREE WITH THE BILL OKAY BUT I HAVE A QUESTION -- IT RELATES TO A PARTICULAR SITUATION FOR MY DISTRICT MY DISTRICT HAS. ESSENTIALLY WATER PROVIDED BY A PRIVATE WATER COMPANY. AND THERE'S ALSO -- OF SMALL WATER COMPANIES. AND IF SO HAPPENS THAT OF SMALL WATER COMPANIES BECOME NOT NON COMPLIANT. HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THAT SITUATION. WHEN -- SURROUNDING WATER COMPANY MIGHT BE SOME BIG. COMPANY THERE'S A KIND OF PRESENT US WITH A CASE WERE WERE FORCING A SMALL WATER COMPANY. TO JOIN THE BIG WATER COMPANY OR HOW DOES HOW DOES IS SO AFFECT THAT SITUATION. PRIVATE CALL IS NOT THE PUBLIC WATER. THE PRIVATE COMPANIES. WHERE WE HAVE THIS BIG COMPANY THE BIGGEST ONE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY? SAN JOSE WATER WATER COMPANY. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR THAT THE THE STRATEGY THAT WERE USING IN THIS BILL. IS IS. TO TAKE CARE OF CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS -- AND THAT UP OVER THE YEARS HAVE JUST NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THERE HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATIONS IT BEEN VOLUNTARY AND SOME THAT HAVE WORKED OUT VERY WELL -- IN AND WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THAT PROCESS AT ALL WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT FOR THESE NON CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT. SYSTEMS WHERE THERE IS NOT A LARGE WATER SYSTEM NEXT TO THEM THAT THEY CAN BE -- CONSOLIDATED WITH THAT THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE AND THIS WOULD GIVE. THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ALLOW A NUMBER OF THESE TO JOIN TOGETHER FOR A KIND OF MEANS OF SCALE ACCESS RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT STATE SO IN THE IN THE INSTANCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY WOULD NOT BE FORCED -- UNLESS THEY THEY ARE THEY CONTINUE TO BE CHRONICALLY A NON COMPLIANT IN THE STATE WATER BOARD CANNOT GET THEM TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. WELL. I AM A WORM ABOUT IS OPEN -- WE HAVE ALL THESE OLD. PROBABLY NON COMPLIANT. WATER SYSTEMS UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. SACRAMENTO NEWS READ WITH THE STATE'S THAT DRIVER YOU KNOW THE AREA. SO THEIR ADJACENT TO SAN JOSE WATER COMPANY [inaudible] BUT THERE. I THINK ONE ONE BANKRUPT -- A FEW YEARS AGO -- HOW DOES IT AFFECT THOSE KINDS OF SMALL MOUNTAIN? WATER COMPANIES LIKE DUNN. THE SITUATION I'M TALKING ABOUT YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- IT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW LIKE IT'S REDUCING SO YEAH OF COURSE I'M SORRY DANIEL BUSTED HAD WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION -- AND IN IN THOSE SITUATIONS YOU KNOW THE THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATOR THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR THE SYSTEMS. SO IT MIGHT BE THE SOLUTIONS RECIPE FOR FOURTEEN WHICH WE THINK YOU KNOW BRIDGES AN IMPORTANT GAP. BUT IT ALSO MIGHT BE THROUGH EXISTING AUTHORITY THAT THE STATE BOARD HAS -- SO IT JUST YOU KNOW IT REALLY OFFERS AT TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AND THERE MAY BE. ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT IS A MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE SYSTEMS OKAY OKAY I THINK THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION. I THANK YOU I'M A SUPPORT THE BILL AND JUST AS A WHERE FOR THAT FRONT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WE'RE WE'RE VERY UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL IN OUR COUNTY THAT MOST OF THE WATERS PROVIDED BY SIMPLY A PRIVATE. WE DON'T HAVE. PUBLIC WATER IN. TOO MUCH IS SACKLER COUNTY SOME SOME CITIES DAILY SACRIFICE SANTA CLARA AND FOLLOW UP TO DO BUT THE THE REST OF US ARE. PRIVATE WATER COMPANIES YEAH AND WHILE THIS IS A POINT IN TIME WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TO BE PART OF THIS BILL. IN THE FUTURE IF THERE'S A SYSTEM THAT BECOMES NON COMPLIANT -- YOU KNOW THE STATE FOUR DOES HAVE EXISTING AUTHORITIES A LAUGH GO YOU KNOW HAS A PROCESS AND SO THOSE COULD POTENTIALLY BE MERGED AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CENTER UP BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AS ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CLARIFYING WITHIN THEM AND STARTED A WE'RE GONNA BE CLARIFYING THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WILL. EVALUATE ALL OPTIONS PROTECTING DRINKING WATER INCLUDING CONSOLIDATION RECEIVERSHIP INFORMATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITY WHICHEVER IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTIVE OF DRINKING WATER SOURCES.

BUT THIS IS A BEEN A TEAM EFFORT MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE ON AB ONE FORTY SEVEN WHICH AND IMPLEMENTS THE WAY FAIR DECISION FROM THE SUPREME COURT IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT IN COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THE WAY FOR DECISION IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT US SUPREME COURT DECISIONS IN DECADES BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ONLINE. AN ATA STATE BUSINESSES WHO DO DIDN'T WHO HISTORICALLY NOT COLLECTED SALES TAX. IT REMOVES THAT ADVANTAGE OVER BRICK AND MORTAR CALIFORNIA RETAILERS WHO'VE ALWAYS COLLECTED TAXES THIS INEQUITY CAN GIVE A BIG EDGE FOR ABOUT SEVEN POINT 25% TO MORE THAN 10%. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IN THE STATE. TO ADDRESS A COMPANIES AN ONLINE RETAILERS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIRTY THREE STATES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THE COURT DECISION AND EVERY OTHER STATE WITH THE SALES TAX IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SUIT. IN AB ONE FORTY SEVEN DOES THE SAME HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. THE MEASURE WILL ALSO INCREASE STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES BY MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AFTER THE FIRST YEAR. MANY OF THESE OCAL REVENUES ARE DEDICATED TO LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. THIS BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ONLINE PLATFORMS AT A STATE BUSINESSES AND MANY OTHERS. AND WE'RE PLEASE HAVE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO WILL BE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT TODAY AND AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE STATE TREASURER WHO'S.

AGREED EXPERIENCE WE'VE ALL WORKED VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND I THINK THE POLICY REPRESENTS -- THE COLLABORATION QUITE WELL -- BUT AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB ONE FORTY SEVEN ALONG WITH MY CO AUTHOR. AS THE TEARS EXPLAIN THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A COMPREHENSIVE AND BALANCED SET OF POST WAY FAIR TAX COLLECTION COLLECTION RULES THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THE CONSUMER. SMALL BUSINESS AND THE STATE. AB ONE FORTY SEVEN DOES SO IN THREE WAYS FIRST IT PROVIDES RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESS BY INCREASING THE ECONOMIC NEXUS THRESHOLD FROM 1-001-000-2500 THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ELIMINATING THE TWO HUNDRED OR MORE SEPARATE TRANSACTION THRESHOLD ENTIRELY. SECOND AB ONE FORTY SEVEN RECOGNIZES THE REALITIES OF TODAY'S ECONOMIST EIGHT COMMERCE A CONNIE BY REQUIRING ONLINE MARKETPLACES TO CLICK SALES TAX SALES AND USE TAX ON BEHALF OF THEIR THIRD PARTY RETAILERS. FINALLY AB ONE FORTY SEVEN PROMOTES CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY. BY REQUIRING RETAILERS TO COLLECT AND REMIT LOCAL DISTRICT TAXES ONCE THEY SELL OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. ELIMINATING THE BURDEN SOME REQUIREMENT TO TRACK SALES IN EACH DISTRICT. OUT WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I'VE HANDED OFF TO TRY TO REPORT WE HAVE TREASURER LAW YES I MET HIM MISTER BUSH I DO MOVE THE BILL. AND WE HAVE A MOTION.

WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE ATTENTION THAT EVERYBODY HAS GIVEN TO THIS. AND THE URGENCY WITH WHICH THEY HAVE ACTED IN MOVING COUNTLESS COUNTLESS ONLINE BUSINESSES WHO ARE NOW. IN THE WAKE OF THE WAY FOR DECISION AND IN THE WAKE OF THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING HOW ONLINE MARKETPLACES ARE BEING TREATED IN WHO HAS THE COLLECTION BURDEN.

A MEASURE AND ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS BILL AT LEAST FROM MY CLIENTS PERSPECTIVE. IS THE HAVING IMPLEMENTATION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AS IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THEM COMING THE NEXT HOLIDAY SEASON SO -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS AND WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR STACEY DOLLY ON BEHALF OF TARGET AND A HOME DEPOT AND I WOULD ECHO DON'S ELOQUENT -- COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS VERY APPRECIATED. REBECCA MARCUS ON BEHALF OF HDL COMPANIES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE IN THE ONE WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. HEARING NONE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS CENTER HERTZBERG [inaudible] ON WHY THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD AND WHY NOT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD. AS SET FORTH IN THE SUPREME COURT CASE WE KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO COLLECT TAXES AND THIS HUNDRED THOUSAND JUST IN CALIFORNIA JIM ABUSES DURING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BERMAN HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO KNOW A WHY NOT BE THAT WE CAN ANALYSIS IS DETERMINE WHAT THE DELTA IS BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH ISREVENUE LOSS BECAUSE SEE WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGICALLY ANYBODY IN BUSINESS TODAY. CAN SIMPLY DOWNLOAD WHICH TAX JAR SO MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WOULD YOU CAN CALCULATE A SALES TAX FROM ALL FIFTY STATES BILLS BILLS TAX ON GOODS AND SERVICES. JUST IN CASE SOMEONE'S LISTENING IT'S REALLY SIMPLE. TO DO AND REALLY INEXPENSIVE TO DO AND SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT WHATWHY LIMITED UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS A BUSINESS WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS AS EASY TO COMPLY. WE DID WE WE STARTED RESEARCH ON THIS LAST AUGUST AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CD TFA WAS THAT THE THREAT THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT WE WOULD SEE IT AS A STATE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WAS VERY CLOSE TO IF NOT EQUAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE. COSTS THAT IT WOULD TO TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT THAT THOSE NUMBERS OF BUSINESSES AND SO AS AS BOTH CD TFA AND AS ALL OF US REVIEW THOSE NUMBERS WE DECIDED THAT TO SIMPLIFY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO ALSO. BECAUSE THE REVENUE OF ONCE WAS SO NEGLIGIBLE THAT THAT IT WAS NOT WORTH DOING IT IT DOESN'T SOUND LOGICAL TO ME I CANNOT BELIEVE. THAT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T USE AN IMPLEMENTATION TOOL IT SOUNDS POLITICAL I GET IT BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME EVEN IF YOU. HE SAID TO THE AGENCY ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT AND NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON COLLECTION SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY THE TAX. AND THAT'S NEW DOLLARS IT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME THAT THE AGENCY WOULD I I WOULD HAVE COST QUESTION THAT CONCLUSION. IF YOU CAN TELL ME THAT WILL TURN IT OVER -- TO MISS PEEL CIRCUS PEOPLE SOCCER IS THE DIRECTOR LEGISLATION FOR THE CALVET APARTMENT TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT. TO SAY THANK YOU I TO THEM AS THEY HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS THE DELTA -- THAT -- THE SENATORS TALK ABOUT AS OF APPROXIMATELY IN THIS BILL CIRCLE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MILLION -- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- THAT'S REALLY A APPROXIMATE ALL THIS STATE. WOULD NOT SEE COMING INTO THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OUR MARKET IS SO SATURATED WITH LARGER ONLINE RETAILERS FRATERNAL REPEAL STICKER TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY -- ANY MISTAKE THAT I MAY JUST MAKE. I GUESS YOU'RE VERY CLOSE -- IT IT SAID TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HOW DID YOU COME WITH A NUMBER. HOW DID -- WE BECAUSE YOU GOT THE HATCHERIES TO COME WITH A NUMBER -- WE LOOKED AT THE UNIVERSE OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD FALL IN BETWEEN THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD BASED ON CENSUS DATA. IF YOU COULD AT SOME POINT A MAP YEAH I JUST LIKE TO KNOW JUST. CURIOUS TO ME I MEAN I KNOW CERTAIN COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON THE LIKE CERTAINLY CONTRACT WITH A LOT OF COMPANIES AND UTILIZE THE AMAZON TOOL IT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES AND ON PRIVACY IN SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WERE INVOLVED IN. TO ACTUALLY -- PROMOTE SALES BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I'M JUST TELLING YOU INTUITIVELY IT MAKE AND IT'S IN THE ECONOMY OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT IS BEING INFORMED IN DRAMATIC WAYS BY THE INTERNET IT'S SHOCKING TO ME. THAT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IS ANYTHING LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I CAN SPEAK TO THAT FIRST OF ALL I WOULD. BE HAPPY TO SHARE TO SHARE THE DATA WILL GET IT TAKEN -- BUT SECONDLY -- INTERNET SALES ARE HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AND LARGE COMPANIES RIGHT SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT ARE ABOVE THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THERE'S JUST NOT A HUGE. DIFFERENCE LOOK AT HAPPY TO SHARE THAT ESTIMATE WITH THE I. WHY WAS THAT IN THE LAST QUESTION IS WHY WAS THAT BY IMPLEMENTATION DATE PUSHED BACK ON THE REST THE COUNTRY'S IMPLEMENTING IT. ON THE EARLIER DATE [inaudible] THE WORLD. SO A FEW ITEMS -- WE'VE BEEN IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION -- WAY CITY TFA THE REASON WHY -- WE ARE LOOKING AT A BIT OF A DELAY -- BUT MAKING SURE THAT IT IS IMPLEMENTED PRIOR TO THE HOLIDAYS. IS TO ALLOW PLATFORMS IN THE LARGEST ONLINE MARKETPLACE IN THE WORLD TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT -- IN IT IS TAKING A BIT LONGER I EVEN THOUGH WE SEEN THIRTY THREE STATES ADAPT JUST BECAUSE THE COMPLEXITY OF A MARKET PLACE. AND WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ADAMANT IN ALL TURN OVER THE CHAIRWOMAN IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIT THAT THE HOLIDAY NUMBER ONE IT'S EQUITY WITH -- BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT VERTICALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT WILL BE -- TO CAPTURE THOSE DOLLARS MEDICARE ISSUE IN FRONT OF HOUSING EQUITY MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING THE SALES TAX RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE GIVEN THIS GOT THE EVERYBODY ONLINE ABILITY NOT TO PAY THE SALES TAX NOT JUST THE REVENUE FROM THE STATE. BUT IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP IN BRICK AND MORTAR AND ONLINE PEOPLE THE ONLINE PEOPLE AREN'T PAYING IT YOU'RE DEALING THEIR OBLIGATION TO PAY. EQUITY WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY. AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSERVATION OCCASION WITH THE RETAILERS WHO REPRESENT ON NINE EXCUSE ME THERE WAS A BRICK AND MORTAR -- THIS IS BEEN ABLE TO THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES AND ALL SITES JUST BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT YOU KNOW A VERY COMPLICATED TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE LANDED IN A SWEET SPOT -- WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE BULK OF THE REVENUE? CENTERS FOR EXACTLY RIGHT ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT% BETWEEN NOW. AND OCTOBER NO IN CALIFORNIA AS WE ALWAYS HERE'S A BIT DIFFERENT IN BECAUSE OF OUR SIZE. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SEVEN CHAIR ANYTHING THAT I MISSED AND I THINK THE OTHER THING IS SOME MARKET. PLACE FACILITATORS ARE STILL IN PROCESS OF COLLECTING THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND WHICH TAXABLE PRODUCTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO. WE DID WE WE TRIED TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT WHERE -- WE WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RAMP UP ON RESPONSIBILITY BUT WE GAVE IT A DEADLINE DATE ON'T AS TO WHEN. WE WOULD START COLLECTING YEAH MY MY ONLY POINT CLOSE ON THIS IS JUST. YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW THIS UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE IT CAME DOWN THE SAME DAY FOR ALL FIFTY STATES. A LOT OF OTHER STATES THAT WE KNOW WE LOOK AT AND WE SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED. TO ALWAYS ASK OURSELVES THE HONEST QUESTIONS AMONG FRIENDS WHY ARE WE WHY IS OUR STANDARD DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE'S NOT JUST SIZE WHY IS THAT THE CASE WHY CAN THEY IMPLEMENT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. HOW DO WE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK WE HAVE THAT OBLIGATION IN? JUST BEING HONEST BROKERS OF PUBLIC POLICY. AND TO THAT ED TO THAT EFFECT I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE NECESSARILY -- HOWEVER THEY WERE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WHERE WE DO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. THE FACT THAT YES IN OTHER THIS HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND PEOPLE SHOULD SHOULD IT HERE TO OUR TO OUR STANDARD IMMEDIATELY -- HOWEVER I THINK WITH THE COURSE OF HOW EASY IT IS AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO ACTUALLY COLLECT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD NOT FULLY PREPARED SOME OF THEM. IN THAT IN THE WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE. WE HAD TO MAKE BASIC DECISIONS ON HOW WE WERE GOING TO GO ABOUT AND DO THIS IN A WAY THAT WAS A SEAMLESS IMPOSSIBLE BOTH FOR THE STATE'S CD TFA AND FOR THE RETAILERS. AND AND AND MY CONCERN IS THAT A C. T. OF A ANNOUNCED THAT BEGINNING APRIL FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN RETAILER LOCATED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA MUST COLLECT USE TAX IF DURING THE PROCEEDING OR CALENDAR YEAR. THE RETAILER'S SALES IN THE CALIFORNIA EXCEED HUNDRED THOUSAND AND OR THE RETAILER MADE SALES INTO CALIFORNIA IN TWO HUNDRED OR MORE SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS WHICH IS -- ACCORDING TO THE COURT CASE HOWEVER APRIL FIRST WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET OUR BILL. THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BY APRIL FIRST I THINK WE WERE TRYING -- THAT WAS THE INTENTION -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ABLE FIRST DEADLINE I HOPE THAT CD TFA ARE IN GOOD FAITH IS GOING TO PUSH BACK. ON SENDING THESE LETTERS -- BECAUSE IT IS VERY CONFUSING OUT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACES WERE CHINA. YOU KNOW -- CREATE THE LAW CODIFY IT AND SEE TFA IS SENDING LETTERS ON THAT ARE YOU KNOW FRANKLY -- UPSETTING FORTY THOUSAND LEAST FORTY THOUSAND AMAZON ONLINE MARKET PLACE UP THERE PARTY PROVIDERS RIGHT NOW.

OF THE SITE. CALLING THIS BILL DOES NOT JUST COME OUT OF THIN AIR -- THIS BILL COMES TO US AFTER DECADES. OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY ATTEMPTING TO WORK WITH THE CAL PALACE ON VARIOUS ISSUES -- AND HITTING THEIR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- AN AGENCY THAT IS -- APPARENTLY UNWILLING TO MEANINGFULLY WORK WITH THE LOCAL. COMMUNITY. FIVE FOR DECADES WE HAVE HAD UNANIMOUS VOTES AT THE DALY CITY COUNCIL IN THE CEMETERY - COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISOR IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ASKING THE CAL PALACE PALACE TO STOP HOLDING GUN SHOWS AT THE SITE. AND THE COW PALACE FOR DECADES HAS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY IGNORED THAT LOCAL DESIRE -- I% AM NOW THE THIRD SENATOR REPRESENTING THIS AREA AFTER JACKIE SPEAR AND MARK LENO -- TO CARRY BILLS TO TRY TO GET THE COW PALACE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION FOR A LONG TIME DALY CITY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO WORK WITH THE COW PALACE. TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE CALIPARI'S LAMB THE CALIPARI'S IS THE BUILDING WHICH PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHICH IS IN VERY POOR CONDITION AND IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK BUT IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PARKING LOTS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE IT'S NOT JUST AN AGRICULTURAL FAIR GROUNDS WE IT IS A MEGA MASSIVE PARKING LOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY. THAT IS. OVERWHELMINGLY NOT BEING USE THERE ARE EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN THE CAL PALACE BUT LARGER AS TIME NOTHING IS HAPPENING IN THIS PARKING LOT AND CREATES BLIGHT. IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND DALY CITY HAS ATTEMPTED FOR YEARS TO WORK WITH THE CAL PALACE TO MAKE BETTER USE OF THE LAND. AND THE CAL PALACE HAS BEEN HELD AT MOST PAID LIP SERVICE AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED -- SO IT'S TIME TO MAKE CHANGE HERE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE NO WERE WORSE THAN THE BAY AREA. AND WE HAVE SIXTY ACRES OF LAND JUST SITTING HERE THAT IS UNDER UTILIZED IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR LAND. TO THE BILL IN ADDITION TO PERMANENTLY BANNING THE GUN SHOWS WILL TRANSFER THE LAND TO THIS LOCAL AGENCY -- WITH THE LIGHT THAT WILL BE COMPRISED OF A BOARD OF ELECTED OFFICIALS APPOINTED. BY THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO BY THE MAYOR OF DALY CITY I'M BY THE CEMETERY COUNTY. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. ON MONDAY NIGHT AND AFTER THE ANALYSIS CAME OUT BUT ON MONDAY NIGHT THE DALY CITY COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT THE BILL -- THE CEMETERY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS NOT YET ACTED BUT WE DO HAVE A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM SUPERVISOR DAVID CAN ABOUT WHO REPRESENTS THIS PORTION. OF CEMETERY COUNTY SO ONCE AGAIN THE LOCAL SUPPORT IS BROAD I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE SIX OR SIX CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL -- EVERY SINGLE LEGISLATORS SENATE AND ASSEMBLY WHO REPRESENTS SAN FRANCISCO OR CEMETERY COUNTY IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THIS IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL LOCALLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY ODDS TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THE BILL OUR STATE TREASURER FIONA Mà WHO USED TO REBEL. STILL REPRESENTS AREA BUT USED TO REPRESENT -- THIS AREA IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY -- AND BUILT LET'S SEE WHO IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF DALY CITY THANK YOU. FOR YOURMOTHER FOR SURE IS YOUR FINANCING THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I A REPRESENTED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT TWELVE FROM INCLUDED. A DALY CITY THE WEST SIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO DALY CITY BROUGHT MRE AND COMMA. UP SO I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE COW PALACE OF VERY CLOSELY SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND ESPECIALLY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN. GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WANTED TO SELL OF THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY -- THE CAP HOUSE WAS BUILT AND DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE FOR THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF HOSTING THE GRAND NATIONAL RODEO AND LIVESTOCK SHOW. SINCE THEN IS HOUSED IN MANY AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FAMILY EVENTS SUCH AS THE CIRCUSES. SWAP MEETS CAR SHOWS HOME AND GARDEN SHOWS OTHER CONVENTIONS BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITES. WHICH IS ONE OF MY HUSBAND'S FAVORITES THE DICKENS FAIR WE'VE BEEN GOING FOR ABOUT ALMOST A DECADE NOW AND IT IS ONE OF THE PREMIER. FAVORITE -- EVENTS THAT WE GO TO SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DICKENS FAIR. FOLKS BACK THERE HOWEVER SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN A WHEN JOE BARKAT. LEFT AS GENERAL MANAGER -- ABLE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE CAL HOW IS BOARD AND MANAGEMENT HAVE FAILED TO FOCUS ON SUSTAINING FAMILY FRIENDLY ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE DANCE. INSTEAD RELIED ON RENTING TO VENDORS FOR REVENUE STEERING AWAY FROM SUPPORTING THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES INTEREST. IN TWENTY TWELVE FOR EXAMPLE -- THAT CAL POWERS BOARD SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH ENTERPRISE RENT A CAR. UP WHERE FOR FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ENTERPRISE A USES A LOT OF THE PARKING SPOTS AND REFURBISHES CARS FOR SALE. IT WAS THE INTENTION AT THE TIME AS I UNDERSTAND -- FROM -- THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT THAT -- THEY WOULD PUT MOST OF THE MONEY TOWARD -- REFURBISHING THE FOUR BIG BUILDINGS WHICH CANNOT BE RENTED TODAY. 90% OF THE INDOOR SPACE LEAKS TERRIBLY FROM THE RAIN. I IN. THE WATER. RUNS CONSISTENTLY THROUGH THE YEAR AND ALSO ALL DAY AND NIGHT I MEAN THIS IS JUST KIND OF A LONG SHORT LIST OF THE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE. RENOVATED AND FIXED AND MAINTAINED HOWEVER THE BOARD. HAS DECIDED NOT -- TO PUT THE MONEY TOWARD REFURBISHING THE SITE BUT INSTEAD PUTTING IT TOWARD OPERATIONS. SO THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE -- I BELIEVE THE COW PALACE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT HAVE LOST ITS FOCUS AND ALLOWED THE PROPERTY TO DECLINE. A WE DEFINITELY NEED LEAD NEW LEADERSHIP AND A NEW PLAN FOR THISHISTORIC PROPERTY. THANK YOU IT IS MUCH BETTER TREASURER NOT ENTER OVER MISS MEMBER SHOULD A ****.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I THINK YOU'VE RECEIVED ABOUT MAYBE OF THIRD OF THE STORY. OF A BILL. WHICH STANDS AS AN EXAMPLE OF NON GERMANE US. BILL AS TO BARGE ONE IS THE GUN SHOW. AND THAT'S NOT NEW TO THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT PART JOE WAS THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE THEN GOVERNOR. WHO I THINK POINTED OUT? THE GUN SHOW PRODUCES ABOUT TO THE COW PALACE THE COMPOUND WAS IS. ONE FIFTY FOUR GREG CULTURAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU HEARD REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT ARE TO OPEN IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE IT'S HISTORY DATES FROM. NINETEEN THIRTY SIX IT WAS PART OF THE WORKS PROGRESS ADMINISTRATION UNDER PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D.. ROOSEVELT. FIFTY FOUR AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS PLUS. AT TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE FAIRS AND EXPOSITIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LAND GRAB PORTION OF THIS BILL. THAT'S WHAT IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA LET ALONE HISTORY OF THE CAL BALANCE. TRANSFERRING A PARCEL HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY ACRES. TO A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAND GRAB IN ORDER. TO FULL FAILS SOMEONE'S. PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH I KNOW I THINK BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE HERE TODAY INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS BANNED NEGLECTED WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT. IT'S A IN THE CITY OF DALY SAID IT. BUT I HAVE TO IS RESPONSIBLE. THIS WAS A DEAD ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN REDEVELOPMENT WAS A PART. OF CALIFORNIA'S LAW AND POLICY AND FORTUNE A LADY WHETHER AN OFFER NET NAMED LEE WHEN YE. IT WAS REJECTED THE AND THE STATE'S SLANDER DAY OF SELF. AND IT YEAH IN SO FAR AS COMMUNITY RELATIONS ARE CONCERNED. HERE ARE THE FACTS FOR YOUR INFORMATION. FIRST RESPOND OR TRAINING TRAINING IN RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES. IS HELD AT THE COW PALACE BY BOTH THE DALY CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. AMBULANCE TRAINING FOR EMERGENCIES IS HELD THE HARM A PILE SO CALLED PAULOS GROUNDS EVERY MONTH. POLICE TRAINING FOR THE DALY CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT OF KERR'S ON THE GROUNDS OF THE COW PALACE. SHARE PRINT SERVICE BUREAUS VAUNTED METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY TRAINS IS BONDS DRIVERS ON THE GROUNDS OF THE CAL PELOSI SELF. THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF ARTS THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGE IN SAN FRANCISCO HOLDS GRADUATION EXERCISE THE JEFFERSON. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS DONE SO -- AS WELL. THE THE JEWS ALSO FOR PARKING FOR THE MOSCONI CONVENTION CENTER -- VANCE AS REQUIRE. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL USES IT FOR TRAINING ITS OFFICERS WHO ARE STATIONED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I AM THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO. JUST YESTERDAY I AM INFORMED. THAT THE TRIAL BALANCE HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO PROVIDE DAYS OF USE. FOR THE TRAINING OF SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT CADETS [inaudible] IS THAT. DISREGARD OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES DALY CITY. AND SAN FRANCISCO IN THE COUNTY OF US SAN MATTEO. IF THIS OCCURS. FIFTY THREE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN BE IN FEAR. OF A BILL NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER THE YEAR AFTER THAT. TO ABOLISH THOSE BURKE CULTURAL DISTRICTS WHICH ARE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART. NOT JUST OF THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BUT OF TODAY'S CALIFORNIA. A COMMA MAY. WHAT I SUGGESTED AREAS THAT WAS IMPLICIT IN THE REMARKS OF MISTER -- PATTERSON WHOSE FAMILY FOUNDED THE DICKENS OF FAIR. DIVIDE THIS BILL IF YOU WILL. DEAL WITH THE GUN SHOW WHERE SHOW WHICH HAS BEEN DEALT WITH Và OUT AT DEL MAR ANOTHER AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. WITH THAT IT IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF VIOLATING GEISHA. BUT DO NOT PASS THAT PART OF THERE'S NON GERMANE BILL. WHICH ENDS THE GLORIOUS HISTORY AND THE GLORIA GLORIA'S CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA'S TO ENJOY ADULT FIRST AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT ONE NAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CENTER WE'RE GRATEFUL TO BROWN THE FOR GEORGIA FIVE MINUTES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION. SENATOR COP DID A FANTASTIC JOB I THINK OF IDENTIFYING AND INFORMING YOU OF THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAL POLICIES UNFORTUNATELY WE HEAR THIS ABOUT DISTRICT AGOSTO STATIONS AND FAIR GROUNDS. PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THAT. PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THERE'S ACREAGE THERE AND IT'S NOT BEING UTILIZED EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR THAT THERE'S SOME EFFORT OVER THERE SOME LACK OF UTILIZATION HAPPENING HAPPENING. I CAN TELL YOU WITH WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THOSE DISTRIBUTORS SO SEE ASIANS NO THE BENEFIT THAT THEY PROVIDE. AND THAT PROPERTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN EMERGENCIES ARISE HOW ARE THE FIRST PLACE AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES LOOKS FOR SO -- WITHOUT A DOUBT. THE SIXTY EIGHT ACRES ACCOUNT PALACES IS VALUABLE PIECE OF PROPERTY. THIS IS CLAIMED TO BE A DISTRICT BILL BUT IT HAS STATEWIDE IMPLICATIONS -- JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE WAS PASSED -- AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM GRAY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND WHAT WE'LL SEE IN THE MAY REVISE OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS THE FIRST FORMULA. FOR AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE FAIR GROUNDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BENEFIT FROM THE SALES TAX REVENUE THAT THEY GENERATE. UNLIKE ANY OTHER AGENCIES THEY GENERATE SALES TAX ON A ANNUAL BASIS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO SALES TAX AND THEY GET NO BENEFIT FROM. MOST DISTRICT ACCESS OR A NUMBER OF DISTRICT ASSOCIATIONS GET NO DIRECT BENEFIT FROM THE STATE AT ALL THE CALIFORNICA SURVIVE ON THE REVENUES THEY GENERATE. IF WE TAKE THIS TRANSFER OF PROPERTY AND SIMPLY MOVE IT AWAY THEN EVERY DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATION EVERY COUNTY FAIR IN THE STATE IS GONNA HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE THE SALES TAX REVENUE LOST. FROM THE COW PALACE THE FUTURE SALES TAX REVENUE FROM GENERATED BY THIS NEW AUTHORITY WILL NOT BE ALLOCATED THROUGH AB. FOURTEEN NINETY NINE THERE'S NO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN SO EVERY DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATION EVERY COUNTY FAIR IN THE STATE OF OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY THIS TRANSFER OF PROPERTY. I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING AND IF YOU JUST. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THE CALCULUS IS SUCCESSFUL FROM A FISCAL BASIS IT'S GENERATING REVENUE EVERY YEAR. IT'S PUTTING MONEY BACK IN THE FACILITY IS IT ABLE TO ACTUALLY PUT ALL THE MONEY THAT'S NECESSARY BACK INTO THE FACILITY TO MAKE IT [inaudible] MODERN. NOT NOT AT ONE CHUNK NOT IN THERE'S NOT ONE DISTRICT ASSOCIATION IN THE STATE THE TABLE TO DO THAT BUT THEY'RE ALL STARTING TO WORK IN THAT EFFORT WERE SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR PUT FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONIES FOR DISTRICT AGOSTO SITUATIONS. THERE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE HAPPENING SO. THIS ELEMENT OF THE BILL WHICH ISN'T NEW TO THE BILL THIS TRANSFER PROPERTY. IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING ON A STATEWIDE BASIS THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY MISTER CHAIR. IS THAT. I THINK THAT IT'S OF IT WAS MISSTATED EARLIER THAT THERE WAS BEEN LIP SERVICE PAID TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO DEVELOP THE PROPERTY IN CALCULUS. THERE'S TWELVE POINT FIVE ACRES AT THE COW PALACE HAS RIGHT NOW THAT IS CONSIDERED THE UPPER PARKING LOT IT IS AN ADJACENT TO TWELVE POINT FIVE ACRES OF PRIVATELY OWNED PROPERTY WHICH IS THEN ADJACENT TO PROPERTY OWNED BY DALY CITY. SEVEN TO TEN YEARS AGO. THERE WERE THEY WERE ALMOST TO THE POINT OF HAVING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP THAT ENTIRE PART OF THE PROPERTY. THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED REVENUE FOR THE CAPITALISTS AND THEN THE RECESSION HIT. AND THE DEVELOPERS WALKED AWAY. THERE'S NOW NEW MANAGEMENT AT THE CITY OF DALY CITY THERE'S NOW RENEWED INTEREST BY THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE COW PALACE IS ENGAGING IN CONVERSATIONS. TO DEVELOP. OR POTENTIALLY DEVELOP THAT PROPERTY BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME IT'S A STATE AGENCY THEY HAVE TO WORK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. BUT THERE IS A GENUINE INTEREST THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND THERE WILL BE IN THE FUTURE. TO TRY TO PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THAT ACREAGE. THAT IS EASILY DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT SITS WITH OTHER PROPERTIES SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO RESOLVE ITSELF. THE GOVERNOR LIKE WAS STATED EARLIER HAS THE ABILITY TO APPOINT TO THESE MEMBERS AND OF THE GOVERNOR SO CHOOSES CAN REMOVE MEMBERS OF A DISTRICT ASSOCIATION AND APPOINT NEW ONES. THIS STATE AGENCY IS DOING WHAT IT'S BEEN TASKED TO DO. IT HAS STATEWIDE IMPLICATIONS ON THIS BILL WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MISTER BROWN WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COMMENT. SO. WE WILL WELCOME INDIVIDUALS TO BE TO PLEASE COME FORWARD IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME THE REASON WHY YOU'RE HERE.

HEARING SEEN NINE WERE IN TURN IT OVER TO THE SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND CENTER WIENER AND THEN -- WILL OPEN UP AA AS TO PROCEDURAL QUESTION. ABS MY LETTER OF MARCH NINETEENTH IN YOUR FILE. I RECEIVED A LETTER AND LET'S GET IT BECAUSE THERE WAS AN IN THE ANALYSIS OPPOSE. THE COMMITTEE I DID RECEIVE THE LETTER MISSING CHESTER CORRECT THANK YOU. MR CUP I THINK SOME MEMBERS HAVE IT WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT -- EVERY MEMBER HAS IT SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE -- GOVERNS IN FINANCE STAFF MAKE THOSE COPIES NOW -- IN BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE. ALL RIGHT -- BUT SOME MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE THE LETTER IS WELL WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER TO SENATOR WINNER SENATOR WIENER. FOR RESPONSIBLE OPEN UP FOR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN -- AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF PUBLICLY CAME OUT -- TODAY -- I WANNA MAKE ONE THING CRYSTAL CLEAR -- IN CASE THERE'S ANY MISUNDERSTANDING BECAUSE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THIS BILL. I THINK A SEEM TO ASSUME THAT THE BILL DICTATES BUT THE CAL PALACE WILL BE TORN DOWN. THE BILL THERE'S NO SUCH THING. ALL THE BILL DOES THE ONE THING IT DOES DICTATE ISN'T UNDER THE GUN SHOWS -- AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE'S SO MUCH SUPPORT. FOR THAT -- BUT THE BILL. TRANSFERS THE LAND SO THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE. BACK COULD MEAN BY AINTAINING THE CALIPARI IT COULD MEAN THAT OF AND DID OF COURSE WOULD HAVE TO BE FINANCE BECAUSE THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE ON IT. BUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COULD DECIDE TO KEEP THE CAL PALACE. OR NOT THAT WILL BE A LOCAL DECISION THIS BILL DOES NOT DICTATE THE REMOVAL OF THE CAL PALACE PERIOD -- I ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE I MET WITH -- WHAT'S IMPAIRS ASSOCIATION -- LAST WEEK AND WE COMMITTED THAT WE'RE ALL GONNA TRY TO WORK TOGETHER -- ON THIS ISSUE AND ENGAGE THE GOVERNOR AND OTHERS SO WE WANT THIS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BUT REGARDLESS THERE HAS TO BE. A CHANGE HERE -- YOU KNOW I WILL ALSO HIS NOTE -- DIET WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THIS. ONE WHY NOT ASSEMBLYMAN TING WHO REPRESENTS OUR CITY AND I'D MET WITH MARK CAUGHT -- CENTER COP'S WIFE WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CAL PALACE -- IS SHE IT CONTINUE TO DEFEND THE GUN SHOWS WE SAID WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING LEGISLATION TO TRANSFER THE LAND IT WAS THIS CONTINUAL DEFENSE OF THE GUN SHOWS WE SAW IT AND CENTER COPS LETTER A DEFENSE OF THE GUN SHOWS. SO EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME. THIS AGENCY CONTINUES NOT. TO EITHER HERE OR UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS SAYING THIS IS NOT A LAND GRAB. THIS IS NOT ME OR ANYONE IS GRABBING THE LAND THIS IS ABOUT THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF DALY CITY SAN MATTEO COUNTY AND SAN FRANCISCO MAKING DECISIONS. ABOUT THE FUTURE ABOUT LAND THAT'S NOT A LAND GRAB THIS IS A PUBLIC PROCESS. SO THEY CAN BE PUBLIC DECISION MAKING BY ELECTED OFFICIALS -- ABOUT THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW CENTER COP MENTIONED THAT THE DALY CITY POLICE AND AT A SEVENTY ANS OF PD ARE USING THE SITE -- THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT AS A REMINDER UNANIMOUS VOTES FROM THE GOVERNING BODIES OF EACH O THOSE CITIES SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION -- SO. YOU KNOW WHATEVER USE IS BEING MADE YES IF YOU HAVE SIXTY EIGHT ACRES OF LARGELY ON USE LAND -- YOU CAN MAKE SOME USE OF IT BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BEST USE OF OUR LAND AND THAT SHOULD BE A LOCAL -- DECISION -- SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR YES THANK YOU SO MUCH. MR NIELSEN IN THE VICE CHAIR. I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL IN EFFECT IS EMINENT DOMAIN BY ANOTHER MEETS [inaudible] NOW. THE CONCERN ALSO IS THE THREAT TO THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS. AND AS YOU NEGOTIATE WITH WESTERN FAIRS CENTERED AT APPRECIATE IF YOU'D BE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE CONCERNS OF ALL OF THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS. AND THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE THE GOVERNING THAT THIS IS NON PRECEDENTIAL. A NON OBLIGATORILY TO ANY OTHER AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT ANY CITY. FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE COULD DECIDE THERE WAS A LOT OF MORE REVENUE IN. DEVELOPING THAT PROPERTY. OR AFFECTING THEIR LOW INCOME HOUSING OR HOME AND IS HOMELESSNESS HOUSING ON THESE SITES. AND THEY THEN IF THEY'RE FRUSTRATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD COME HERE. AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT SO I'D ASK YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT AS WE PROCEED. THIS IS THESE FARES. ARE OF INTEGRAL PART OF OUR HISTORY. IN OUR WN LOUNGE WE'VE SHOWCASE THE POSTERS FROM THOSE HISTORIC FAIRS. WE MUST NOT FORGET THEM. WE MUST NOT COMPROMISE SO I AM ASKING THAT INDEED COMPROMISED BE AFFECTED. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS YES IN CENTER WHERE HE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. SO -- SENDER ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT -- AS I EXPRESSED TO MISTER BROWN THAT WHAT WE WILL BE -- WORKING TOGETHER AND DIALOGUING TOGETHER -- ABOUT LEGISLATION WE WERE VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT TO BE A PROCESS AND THIS IS A PRETTY UNIQUE SITUATION INTO UNIQUE SORRY UNIQUE SITUATION -- UNIQUE HISTORY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I IN JUST A FEW OBSERVATIONS COMMENTS AND A FEW QUESTIONS BUT TO THE LETTER FROM SENATOR COP -- WHO IS VERY SPECIFIC ON IT A SPECIFIC DATE THAT -- HE HAS BEEN AT THE COW PALACE SINCE DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE ON THAT DATE. SO I TO SAID ABOUT SIT AND THINK ABOUT THAT I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHERE I WAS ON THAT DAY. TOO I'M. I WAS -- AGITATED BUT THE NEXT DAY I WAS BORN. YOU'RE DATING YOURSELF. BUT I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY TO SEE THAT DATE. IN YOUR LETTER FIRST SENTENCE BUT I I TO ENJOYED BEATING ON THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS BACK WHEN SCHWARZENEGGER WHICH PRESIDENT I WAS ONE OF THE AS A SUPERVISOR WAS ONE OF THE BIDDERS SO I CERTAINLY REMEMBER THAT INTERESTING TIME -- ARE WE WERE NOT THE WINNING BIDDER BUT THE WHOLE THING WAS RESCINDED AFTER A BRIEF TIME AND SO THE ORANGE COUNTY IS STILL. BEING RUN -- AS A A DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION AND AND DOING WELL -- I DID SOME RESEARCH THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIR I LIVE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIR THAT I ACTUALLY WALKED THERE. YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S A FEW BLOCKS WHEN I WHEN THE BEARS ON ANY WILL BOTHER WITH THE PARK I JUST MY WIFE IS WHAT. BUT HAVING. IT HAS THE CROSSROADS OF THE WEST GUN SHOW EVERY OTHER MONTH AND AND I SEE NO INCREASE AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RAISED. FOR THE COW PALACE SAID THAT THAT ISN'T. SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I I JUST CAN'T GET A COROLLARY SO I'M I'M I'M SAYING I I DON'T SEE. OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RAISED ABOUT THE GUN SHOW -- SO SO WITH THAT I JUST HAD. YOU KNOW DOING SOME MORE RESEARCH YOU ARE YOU KNOW IT AND MEETING WITH IDIVIDUALS THERE IS A SAN MATTEO COUNTY FAIR AND THERE IS THE COW PALACE BOTH IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. AND THE COW PALACE IS A DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL. ASSOCIATION IT'S PART OF THE FAIRS LIKE ORANGE COUNTY IS BUT THE SAN MATEO. COUNTY FAIRS ACTUALLY COUNTY PROPERTY. AND IT'S A COUNTY. YOU KNOW TO SEARCH DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE AG GROUPS SO I I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM ANY OF THE PARTIES -- HAS EVER BEEN DISCUSSION INSTEAD OF DOING YOUR PROPOSAL OF DOING A SWAP. THE V. CALIPARI ODDLY COULD THAT THE DOES THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT IS BOTH SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY AND CEMETERY COUNTY AND A SMALL PIECE. OF THE CAL PALACE AXES IN SAN FRANCISCO -- THE BULK OF IT IS AND CEMETERY COUNTY IN DALY CITY BUT THOSE CROSSOVER IN SAN FRANCISCO SO IT IS A TO COUNTY -- I'M UNAWARE IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A PROPOSAL -- TO DO A SWAP -- SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT LET ME GIVE YOU AN ANSWER -- AS FAR AS I KNOW AND I'LL DATE THIS FROM. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY DISCUSSION OVER MERGING. OKAY JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP YOU KNOW BEING FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEEN. ALL OVER YOUR COUNTIES BUT THE FEELING OF MA I I KNOW YOU THE TREASURES HERE OF CHARGE OF MANAGING THE CASH. CONTROL IS PROBABLY THE RIGHT PERSON ASKED ME BUT YOU MAY KNOW. IT IS OUR OUR OUR THE FDA'S EVEN IN THAT CHART OF ACCOUNTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THEY ARE A LISTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AG. SO KAREN ROSS -- DOES NO WE HAVE I THINK SEVENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT FAIRGROUNDS AROUND THE STATE AND SO -- IT IS UNDER HER DEPARTMENT BUT YES THERE THEY GET NO CASH NO SUPPORT. FROM THE STATE RIGHT AND AT THAT WOULD EVEN BE IN THE CHART OF ACCOUNTS I MEAN IF THEY WERE IF YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR THESE AFFAIRS REJECT. IT'S STILL IN THE CHART OF ACCOUNTS -- BUT BECAUSE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE USED TO BUDGET A CERTAIN AMOUNT LOUIS PROBABLY CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH WAS BUDGETED. A WE FOUGHT FOR IT TO GET SOME MONEY BACK INTO THE BUDGET -- WHICH WE WAS JUST UP -- A PORTION OF THE SOME THAT USED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FAIRS AND THEN IT WAS NEVER RESTORED. AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT OF THE COMPOUNDING PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE THE MONEY WAS NEVER -- RESTORED BACK IN THE BUDGET AND THEN YOU KNOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAY THE PROPOSED THE BILL TO ALLOCATE THE SALES TAX TO HELP THE FAIRS BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET ISSUES BUT I THINK -- LOUIS PROBABLY I CAN TELL YOU WHERE. ON HOW MUCH MONEY IN AND WHERE ALL THESE ACCOUNTS ARE BURIED. THANK YOU MANAGER MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION I IN FACT A HORSE RACING WAS LEGALIZED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AS BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A SUPPORT FOR THE NETWORK A CALIFORNIA FAIRS. AND SO ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL -- GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER'S TERM -- THERE WAS A PERCENTAGE OF LICENSE FEES A GENERATED BY HORSE RACING THAT WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE. AND THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS I NEVER REALLY REACHED THAT AND SO REALLY AT THE HEYDAY I THINK WE WERE RECEIVING ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT WOULD THEN GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THEY WOULD THEN DISTRIBUTE THAT AMONGST THE FAIRS DISTRICT AGOSTO SOLUTIONS AND COUNTY FAIRS -- TO COVER OPERATING EXPENSES BUT THEN THEY ALSO COVERED OTHER -- AREAS LIKE INSURANCE COSTS WORKERS COMPENSATION RETIREMENT EXCEPT -- FOR THEN. THE RECESSION HIT. A GOVERNOR BROWN A RESCINDED ALL THIRTY TWO MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT THREE YEARS -- AND FAIRS WERE LEFT TO SURVIVE ON JUST WHAT THE GENERATED A GOVERNOR BROWN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO -- THEN. ADDED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE FOR THE PURPOSES OF HELPING THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE FAIRS. SO THERE'S DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE BASED ON THE REVENUE THE FARE. ON THE SMALLEST FAIRS CLASSES ONE THROUGH -- FOUR ARE THE ONES THAT NOW RECEIVE SOME NOMINAL SUPPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO HELP THEM SUSTAIN ON THEIR OPERATING SIDE -- BUT NO FAIR GROUND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY -- UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIAL ALLOCATION RECEIVES ANY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ASSISTANCE. OR ANYTHING BEYOND THAT NOMINAL AMOUNT. AND YOU'RE NOT GIVING ANYTHING TO THE STATE EITHER. WELL I WOULD -- AIM FOR PENSION COSTS TO CALPERS SIR YES THE SALES TAX CELLS CELLS TAX GENERATED -- AT A LOCAL LEVEL THE HOTELS THAT ARE GENERATED THE RESTAURANT. THAT'S JUST CORRECT CORRECT YES FOR THE ON THE ON THE GROUNDS THAT FAIRS DO PAY -- YOU KNOW THEY PAY -- FOR AUTO INSURANCE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL INSPECTOR SERVICES THEY PAY THEIR INSURANCE COSTS THEY PRO RATTA FEES HOW TO THE DEPARTMENT SO THERE IS SOME MONEY. THAT COMES BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO -- THESE. FAIR GROUNDS ARE ON THE RUN. FINANCIALLY WHATEVER THEY GENERATE THEY KEEP -- I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR SENATOR NIELSEN AYE IN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE OMMITTEE WE APPROVED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. AMOUNT FOR THE CALYX BOTH YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN AS HAS INCREASING COSTS TO AND I HEAR ON THE RADIO THIS MORNING THAT THEY GET A HOMELESS SHELTER FOR HUNDRED BEDS -- TO SO THINGS ARE YOU KNOW HAPPENING TO THESE THESE THESE FACILITIES. SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS -- SENATOR -- IF IF THE BIG ISSUE FIRST WAS THE GUN SHOW WHITE ONE IS IN THE STATE JUST. THEY WOULD BE EARNING ON THE GUN SHOW AND AND WILL GIVE THAT TO YOU AND SWAP IT OUT. SO THAT THE THE PAIR GROUND IS IS IS. IS EVEN AND THEN YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT ISSUE IF IT'S AN ISSUE AND THEN. AND THEN THEN WE LOOK AT MAYBE A BIGGER PLAN SAYING WHAT WE DO TO THESE FAIRGROUNDS TO HELP THEM OUT WITH THIS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SURE SO -- FIRST OF ALL THE THE WITH REGARD VARYING ESTIMATES FROM THE CAL PALACE FOR THE GUN SHOW GENERATED ABOUT A REVENUE OUT OF A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR -- BUDGET THAT THEY HAVE SO IT'S A SMALL PORTION -- BECOME PALACES AND TOLD US BECAUSE THEY BONTA ME INTO SOMEONE AND TING ASKING FOR I THINK TEN OR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO FIX THE ROOF AND DO OTHER THINGS THIS IS IT'S A TINY DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT TO BE CLEAR. EVEN THOUGH THE GUN SHOW ISSUE HAS DOMINATED THE THE NEWS AND TERMS OF THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE CALIPARI LOCAL COMMUNITY ONCE THAT'S BEEN THE HEADLINES. THE ISSUE RUNS MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT AND THE LAND USE ISSUES ARE ALSO -- A DEEP FRUSTRATION -- IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THESE ARE BOTH SIGNIFICANT ISSUES EVEN THOUGH ONE IS GOT MORE PUBLIC ATTENTION. I GUESS WE COULD SOLVE THIS BY JUST BUDGETING TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. RIGHT THE AND THAT WOULD BE A FOR THE GUN SHOW JUST THAT THAT COMPONENT AND THE OTHER PART OF IT SENATORS IT'S MORE OF A FAMILY FIGHT RIGHT IT'S LIKE WE WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS PLACE IS. BEING MANAGED AND SO THEREFORE WE'RE GOING. TO HAVE TO PUT A NEW OWNERSHIP SO TO SPEAK AND AND I DON'T KNOW OUR EVERY YOU KNOW THAT THE TERM. THE TERMS OF IN USE LAND GRAB -- EMIT EMINENT DOMAIN -- I'M REAL NERVOUS I'M ARM REAL NERVOUS ABOUT THAT KIND OF APPROACH BECAUSE OF WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND AND IT'S LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO SETTLE. A LOCAL PROBLEM HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT TO HELP ME OUT WELL. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT. THIS IS NOT LIKE TO CITIES FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER GO TO SACRAMENTO THIS IS. LAND THAT IS THE PROBLEM IS IT AGENCY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT LIKE LOCAL FIGHT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS WITH A STATE AGENCY THAT IS NOT LISTENING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AT OUR ONLY RECOURSE OUR ONLY RECOURSE. IS TO GO TO THE STATE FIX THE SITUATION SO THAT'S WHY IT'S HERE. BUT YOU'RE ASKING THE STATE TO IN A SENSE TRANSFER OVER IT'S THE A A TO A J. P. A. N. THAT. THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING ASK ISN'T RIGHT AND WE AND WE DO HAVE IN TIME I WAS IN THE BILL THE WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE. ABOUT WORKING ON HOW THE FINANCIAL -- ARRANGEMENT WILL OCCUR -- AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE -- IS IS MADE WHOLE AND THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IF THERE'S DEVELOPMENT HERE -- THE STATE COULD HAVE A STAKE IN THE DEVELOPMENT THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING IT BUT WE DID WE HAVE AGREED TO THAT TIME LANGUAGE. AND THAT WILL BE AN ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. I'M JUST WONDERING CENTER COP YOU HAVE A REBUTTAL TO THAT. HELLO DECIDED YOU YO REVIEW OF HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT. HASN'T FOR ALMOST A DECADE GOTTEN ANY MONEY OUT OF A STATE BUDGET. AND NUMBER -- TWO IT MAKES MONEY IT TURNS A PROFIT EVERY YEAR. AND CONTRA RATED TESTIMONY FROM AS MAMA IT IS IN GOOD SHAPE EXCEPT FOR THE ROOF [inaudible] AND INCLUDING MONEY. FOR A NEW ROOF WOULD BE AN ACT THAT WOULD DISTINGUISH THOSE COMMITTEE NOT JUST IN MY MIND BUT IN THE MINDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE REPRESENTED. BY THOSE WHO TESTIFIED AS WITNESSES. TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT EXCLUDED BUT TRANSFER. WITHOUT COMPENSATION OF THE SIXTY EIGHT OR SEVENTY ACRES ITSELF. THANK YOU SANDERS THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE NEED TO SHOW QUESTIONS ARE COMMON SIDE IF YOU COMMENTED LIKE THEIR TO MAKE BUT BEFORE WE DO LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE IN THE FINAL ALL RIGHT. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY ON ON ALL SIDES. WE ARE ALWAYS GRATEFUL THAT CENTER COPPICING COMMITTEE THANK YOU SIR AND WIENER THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS. BECAUSE THE THE AMENDMENTS ARE THERE SOME FAMILIAR THEMES -- AND SIMILAR THEMES THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF ADVANCED. ONE IS THERE'S LANGUAGE THAT -- THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S AGREED -- TO TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE DOES NOT LOSE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSFER. I IN THAT THE STATE IS CAPITAL. IN THAT FOLLOWS PRESIDENT WITH OTHER LAND WHETHER IT IS A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS -- TO STATE HIGHWAY RIGHT AWAY CENTER AND MAINTAINED TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE GENERAL FUND IS CAPITAL. I IN THAT BRINGS IT INTO CONSISTENT STATUS WITH PREVIOUS ANGEL TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION IN THIS IS AN ITEM THAT AT SHARED SENATOR AND ALSO SHARED WITH MISTER BROWN -- IN NOT HAVING A BILL THAT CREATES PRECEDENT FOR OTHER FAIRS -- IN I DO AGREE WITH -- CENTER NIELSEN FIND ENSURING THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE PRECEDENT SETTING AS WE MOVE FORWARD. HI AND THERE IS INTENT LANGUAGE THAT IS NOW IN THIS BILL HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR. I'LL ALSO SAY THAT -- WE ALL HAVE. ISSUES WITHIN OUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE OF UTMOST CONCERN. AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS AS A LOCAL ISSUE. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING COMMUNITY DISCUSSION -- WITH -- A DALY CITY -- WITH THE COUNTY SAN MATTEO -- AND SOMEWHAT WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BUT I THINK BOTTOM LINE IS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE THIS COMMAND TO MORE IMPORTANT NEVER TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE. I'M IN THERE ARE CHALLENGES -- AND I'M NOT FROM THE AREA BUT NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN THAT PART OF THE CITY -- IN WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DONE SHOWS -- THAT IS ONE ISSUE -- AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER IT IS THE PRIVATE SECTION FOR THE COW PALACE SECTION. DALY CITY SECTION. OF WHAT IT MAKE IT LAND OR POTENTIAL LAND THERE ARE DEVELOP AROUND -- THE COW PALACE. THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SOME HIGHEST AND BEST USE. AND BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT IT -- THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO START HAVING A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FROM AN OUTSIDER LOOKING IN. FOLKS ARE DONE AGAIN IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THE CONVERSATION. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TODAY -- THAT'S WHY WE'VE ADVANCED THE AMENDMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS KEPT WHOLE THIS IS NOT CREATE A PRECEDENT AND IT IS TIME FOR THIS CONVERSATION THAT -- BE RESOLVED ONCE AND FOR ALL -- IN ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT GONNA MAKE SOME FOLKS HAPPY -- BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE NONE THE LESS. SO THAT THAT'S WHERE I CURRENTLY STAND TODAY NO TURN OVER -- TO CENTER WIENER -- FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS RESPECTFUL S. FROM MY VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH IN A WINNER -- PLEASE. CENTER AND WE DO WE HAVE THAT PRESIDENTIAL LANGUAGE. THE LOOK AT THIS AS WE DO IT'S WITHIN THE PACKET OF WHAT WE PUT OUT -- REAL QUICK SO WE CAN SHOW THE CENTER JUST FLAG IT TO ME I WOULD.
