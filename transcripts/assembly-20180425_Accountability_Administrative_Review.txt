COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND PRESENTWE WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR YOUR. BILL AB 27-29 THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND A. MEMBER. I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE AS CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. WHERE AN ISSUE WAS RAISED? AND BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL ARE REGARDING THE CURRENT STATUTORY. LANGUAGE AUTHORIZING V. LOCAL HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM. KNELT BEFORE GOING FURTHER LET ME FIRST MAKE IT ABSOLUTE CLEAR THAT. I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM. AND I'M A FULLY IN SUPPORT OF OUR STATE AUDITOR'S WORK ON THE LOCAL HIGH RISK ON A PROGRAM. BUT WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE RIGHT PROCEDURE IN PLACE. SO THAT WHETHER IT'S THE CURRENT AUDITOR OR WHETHER IT'S A FEATURE AUDITOR. WE HAVE. THE. PROPER IN MY OPINION INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS. ARE ON THE STATE AUDIT PROCESS. THE ISSUE WAS RAISED BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OPINION WHICH. IS REFERRED TO IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BUT BASICALLY. THE CURRENT STATUTORY LANGUAGE IS THE PLAIN LANGUAGE IS PRETTY CLEAR. THE STATE AUDITOR IS LIMITED. TWO. WHAT IT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS WELL AS? AUDIT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS. AND INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN GET FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE EAST OR THE. THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. SO WHAT. THE STATE AUDITOR IS CURRENTLY. CONDUCTING AND. WHAT THEY CALL THEIR INITIAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS? AND APPRECIATE DE HOW YOUR COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES SUMMARIZES. THERE IS A FIVE STEP PROCESS THAT THEY TAKE BEFORE THEY COME TO THE J. LACK COMMITTEE. WITH THE AUDIT REQUEST. THOSE FIVE STEPS ACCORDING TO THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE CURRENT PA CODE SECTION. IT'S NOT AUTHORIZED AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM HERE. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING? IS WHAT I WOULD ANALOGIZE TO. MY PREVIOUS WORK AS A PROSECUTOR WHERE. YOU KNOW WHEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT WANTS TO CONDUCT A SEARCH YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CHECK JUST CAN'T GO OUT AND AND CONDUCT THE SEARCH THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE COURT TO GET. TO SHOW PROBABLE CAUSE. TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT A FULL BLOWN. AUDIT REQUEST BUT IT'S A. IT'S A REQUEST TO THE J. LACK COMMITTEE. FOR AUTHORIZATION TO CONDUCT THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT. BOB THIS ALSO EMPOWERS THE STATE AUDITOR TO NOT HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE CHAIR ELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE AUDIT. BUT THEY MAY PROCEED AFTER THEY J. LIKE COMMITTEE. APPROVED THAT INITIAL ASSESSMENT. AND THE FOLLOWING AUDIT AS WELL THOSE AS WELL AS ANY FOLLOW UP AUDIT WORK GOTTA. DIE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE AUDIT. IT ALSO EMPOWERS THE AUDITOR TO TERMINATE THE AUDIT. IF THEY FEEL THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. TO PROCEED. SO. I BELIEVE THIS IS A. A REASONABLE PROCEDURAL. MEASURE THAT. WILL STRENGTHEN THE AUDITOR. TO CONDUCT THE GREAT WORK THAT TACK SHE DOES FOR OF THE LEGISLATURE IN. CONDUCTING OUR LEGISLATIVE HUNDREDS NOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I I ALSO A. HAVE. LISA GOLD KILL THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY FROM THE ALLIES HAD OF COUNSEL'S OFFICE WHO. I DRAFTED THE. OPINION UPON WHICH TO. WE WE BASIS STATURE. ARE ANY MEMBER HAS ANY QUESTIONS TRY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY SUPPORT ANY OF THE MEASURES BUT WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OPINION. AND TO INDICATE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE IS NO EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DO INITIAL. INVESTIGATIONS AT THE OCAL AGENCY UNDER THE EXISTING STATUTORY SCHEME. OKAY. SO THIS IS THIS IS OUR PROFIT A LOT OF A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. AND SO. AND THAT AND AND I AND I AGREE AND THAT PROVED THAT AUTHORITY OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND. IN THE PLEDGE THAT COUNCIL FOUND THAT. THE CURRENT WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS OPERATING WAS THAT. NOT NOT COVERED. MSTER THIS ATTEMPT TO DO THAT AND I WILL I WILL ALSO SAY AND I'VE AND I TALKED A BIT ABOUT THIS I KNOW MR LARA IS WORKING ON A BILL AT THE SAME TIME. AND HE HAD ONE OF THE BILLS THAT STARTED THEM THE HIGH RISK POOL SO. WHO ARE BROKEN NATION IS FOR AND I TODAY ABOUT WERE SUPPORTIVE OF OF US ALL GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND THE THE PROPER WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH THE CHECKS AND BALANCES? OPERATING UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WITH ALSO THAT. OF THE FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF SUTTER IMPORT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. IT WAS YOU CAN OPPOSITION TODAY. CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE DILLON GIVENS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE'RE NOT OFFICIALLY OPPOSED TO THIS TIME BUT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS. WITH THE LEGISLATION. AT. THE WAY THAT THE HIGH RISK. A LOCAL AGENCY OUT A PROGRAM WAS PUT TOGETHER. WHAT'S IN CONCERT WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS LEAGUE OF CITIES SEE SACK AYE WE WORKED WITH. SENATOR LARA WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM. THAT WAS WORKABLE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS WORKING NOW. IS JUST THAT. THAT THE ASSESSMENTS ALLOW THE AUDITOR TO COME IN A PRIOR TO ELEVATING. THE ISSUE PUBLICLY TO TO BRING GREATER CONCERN A GREATER AND I WOULD ARGUE UNNECESSARY CONCERN TO HIGHLIGHT. WHAT MAY BE HAPPENING IN A CITY OR A SPECIAL DISTRICT I THINK THAT'S EVIDENT BY THE WAY THE PROGRAM'S BEEN WORKING SO FAR? THE WAY THAT IT'S HAPPENED SO FOR THE. THE AUDITOR HAS LISTED SIX CITIES. TO BE. OF THAT THAT IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK TO DO MISSUS AND I DO ASSESSMENT AND FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS THREE. AFTER DOING THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT FATHER DETERMINE THAT THEY ONLY NEEDED TO DO THREE AUDITS OF THE CITIES OF THREE AFTER THE ASSESSMENT DIDN'T REQUIRE AN AUDIT. AND FOR THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS NONE OF THEM REQUIRE THE AUDIT AND SO THAT IS EVIDENT THAT THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AND IT WASN'T. I DON'T SEE WHY WASTING TIME BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE LOCAL AGENCIES IN DETERMINE THEIR THEIR FINANCIAL RISK. WITH REGARD TO. I APPRECIATE THE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ASSIST IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE PROGRAM IS IS MEETING THE LETTER OF THE LAW. BUT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT RATHER THEN. CHANGING THE PROGRAM TO MEET THE EXISTING LA THAT WE WOULD CHANGE THE LA TO MEET THE WAY THAT THE THE FUNCTIONING PROGRAM IS WORKING. AND SO ALONG THOSE LINES WE PLAN ON SUPPORTING THE LARA BILL. AND THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE WITH REGARD TO AT THE ANALOGY TO THE SEARCH WARRANT. AND WHILE I APPRECIATE IT THE I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IS FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES IS THIS IS ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION THERE IS NO. REQUIREMENT TO. ROUTE SEEK YOU KNOW THAT PERMISSION TO ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION THE PUBLIC CAN THIS. OVER THE PHONE ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION. BUT SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT THAT IS A NECESSARY CHECK AND I THINK THAT WOULD THE WAY THAT THIS IS BEING PROPOSED TO BE DONE. IF THE AUDITOR WERE TO COME TO V. J. LIKE COMMITTEE TO ASK MAY I DO AN ASSESSMENT. FOLLOWED BY AN AYE AYE THE JAILER COMMITTEE. I WOULD ASSUME WOULD BE FORCED TO APPROVE ALL OF THEM. AND SAY YES. YEAH WE WE DON'T OBJECT TO YOU DOING AN ASSESSMENT. AND AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A BAD THING I DON'T THINK THAT WE WE APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS IN THAT. WHEN THE AUDITOR DETERMINES AFTER AN ASSESSMENT THAT THEY WANT TO DO AN AUDIT THAT THEY COME TO THE JAIL AT COMMITTEE. AND THE PUBLIC AGENCY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE AND AND MAKE THEIR CASE SAY WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT WIRED SOME OF HIS USE ISSUES OCCURRING. HOWEVER PRIOR TO. THERE BEING IN AN ACTUAL. NECESSARY AUDIT IS DETERMINED BY THE AUDITOR. IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR THEM TO COME UP AND SAY WELL. I WE KNOW THAT YOU'VE READ THESE ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER AND YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THIS INFORMATION. AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO DEFEND OURSELVES PUBLICLY. WHAT THE WITH THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET UP NOW IS IT ENSURES DE HELPS TO ENSURE? THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT. BRINGING THE AUDIT TO THE AUDIT REQUESTS TO THE GILLETTE COMMITTEE PRIOR TO. THIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT MAY. WHO MADE? HARM THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE THE PROGRAM IS SET UP THE WAY IT WAS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND SHOULD THIS BILL BEFORE WE WILL BE. WE WILL LIKELY BE TAKING IT AND OPPOSE POSITION BUT. FOR NOW SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND WE PLANNED TO SUPPORT THE FEDERAL ARE BILL THE ALTERNATIVE AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE AYE BY BE THE ARGUMENT YOU BET I I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR'S WELL. I'M SO I THINK YOU FOR PER REITERATING THE POSITION OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE BOB I THINK. WE'LL LET ME LET ME GO AHEAD. I DID THE LOOKED AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED AND I CAN TELL YOU AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS HEAD ON UP CITY COUNCIL WHEN THE AUDITOR CAME AROUND. I WOULD LIKE THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO A WAITING ON THAT FIRST. BECAUSE THERE WAS A BIT WAS WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF. HELP. AND THEN WE HAD TO TAKE A BREAK. PERSON THINGS TO GO GO FORWARD FIRST. SO I. IN AM MISTER MERCER GENERAL AIDID AT THE MINIMUM. COURSE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO RESPOND UP IS GOING TO SAY I MEAN I THINK THESE ARE GOOD YOU YOU COULD MAKE A MISTAKE. I THINK THESE ARE GOOD HEALTHY CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S DONE IS REALLY ALLOW US TO STEP BACK AND SAY. HOW HOW IS IT FUNCTIONING HOW IS IT GOING FORWARD IS IT WORKING IS A NOT WORKING IS IT PROPERTY WITHIN THE LAW THE LAW IS IT OPERATING UNDER THE CA AGAIN? THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. THIS IS THE THE AUDITOR OPERATES UNDER OUR AUTHORITY SO IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING IT IN THE WAY THAT IS MOST HELPFUL. THAT WE STAY A ABREAST OF WHAT IS GOING ON. AND SO AND I MISTER MURSHID GMS OR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO FIND TUNIS MR RESEARCHING YES I AGAIN I WANT TO. EMPHASIZE THAT I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL HIGH RISK AUDIT PROGRAM AND I I BELIEVE THAT THE REP CENTER FOR THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. IS INDICATING HOW OUR CURRENT STATE AUDITOR IS EXERCISING HER POWER RESPONSIBLY AS SHOWN BY. HOW? THAT SHE HAS TERMINATED HER LOCAL HIGH RISK. ENQUIRIES AFTER THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT BUT I I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I I I DO. I BELIEVE THAT THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS IS WRONG IN TERMS OF. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT JUST BEING LIMITED TO TO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. BECAUSE THAT IT OF THE THE FIVE STEP PROCESS IS. ARE SUMMARIZED IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND IT'S ALSO ON THE STATE AUDITOR'S PAGE. THAT THE FIVE STEP PROCESS THAT THE STATE AUDITOR ENGAGES PRIOR TO JAIL LACK APPROVAL. IS FIRST. LOOKING TO AVAILABLE INFORMATION. FROM A LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCY THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. BUT THEN PROCEEDING TO INITIAL CONCERNS. MEETING WITH AS MANAGEMENT TO DISCUSS RISK FACTORS AND EXPECTED TIME LINES FOR THE AUDITOR'S ANALYSIS. VISITING THE AGENCY PERFORMING AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT WHICH THE AUDIT TEAM SPENDS APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE WEEKS ON SITE. AND THEN HOLDING AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT CLOSE OUT MEETING WITH AGENCY MANAGEMENT AT THIS ALL HAPPENS BEFORE J. LACK APPROVAL HERE SO. I THINK EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW THAT KNOWLEDGE AT LEAST A HEADS UP THAT. THAT THE STATE AUDITOR IS CONDUCTING ALL OF THIS IN YOUR DISTRICT BEFORE THEY COME FOUR CHAIR LIKE APPROVAL AND THAT IS THE POINT OF MY BILL. I THINK SHE WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BUT A MONTH IS EGGMAN HERE THAN A MONTH IS EGGMAN PRESIDENT PATTERSON. PATTERSON PRESIDENT BURKE. FRAZIER. FRAZIER PRESIDENT MEDINA. MEDINA PRESIDENT LACKEY. LACKEY PRESIDENT QUIRK SILVA. SILVA PRESIDENT. THANK YOU WE HAVE A CORE. YEAH I THINK THIS IS A I MEAN I THINK IT'S FASCINATING THAT THAT'S AND THIS IS COMING FORWARD I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WANT TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND AND CONTINUE. TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. WE WILL HAVE BUT YOU DO NOT RESPECT AUDITOR AND AND THE ON THE UNDER OFFICE BUT THIS IT'S A IS IT POSITION IS NOT ALWAYS GONNA BE THE SAME PERSON TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE WILL FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY IT'S GOING AT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY. AND TRANSPARENCY COMES FROM FROM KNOWLEDGE AND AND KNOWLEDGE COMES FROM PEOPLE COMING BEFORE COMMITTEE IN BEING ABLE TO SAY WE HAVE CONSEQUENCE EARNS ABOUT THIS THIS AND THIS AND SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD. BOMB SO. IT QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IN THE COMMITTEE. MISS QUIRK SILVA. I APOLOGIZE CAME IN A LITTLE BIT AFTER YOUR TESTIMONY BUT UP. AS FAR AS IT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WHETHER IT BE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICT I EVEN SCHOOL BOARDS ALL OF THE ELECTED POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE. ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE FOUND WITH CONSTITUENTS OVER AND OVER IS THEY HAVE VERY VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. OF WHAT THE PROCESSES ARE NOT ONLY FOR VERYBASIC THINGS LIKE HOW YOU VOTE BROWN ACT ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES. THAT THERE'S CONCERN OVER. THEN WHEN YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT. STEP MAYBE TO THE STATE ON AN AUDIT. I CAN GUARANTEE THAT ALL VERY FEW PEOPLE EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS SO IT'S NOT ONLY THE WORK OF THE AUDITOR BUT IT'S ALSO THE INFORMATION THAT IS BROUGHT BACK TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO OUR COUNTIES AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE. IT'S ONE THING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN HOUSE SO MANY THE PEOPLE ARE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE MANY OF THE PEOPLE HERE WE COME TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE A IN MANY WAYS BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT TO THE AVERAGE CONSTITUENT YOU WHICH IS WHO WE SERVE. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE FAITH THAT UP. AND CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESSES WE TAKE AND UP MANY TIMES THERE'S COMPLAINT AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHO TO GO TO. AND SO THEIR FIRST STEP IS PROBABLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT ONCE YOU START TO DRILL DOWN. THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON WHAT THE RESULT IS THAT THEY WANT BUT THEY DO WANT TRANSPARENCY THEY DO WANT ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK ON THE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT SIDE. WE CAN AGREE ON THAT THOSE TWO WORDS I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH DISAGREEMENT SO I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE TO ME. AS MUCH PROCESSES WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE OUR PUBLIC HAS CONFIDENCE IS SOMETHING THAT I SUPPORT BY THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. IT'S FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND. I DO SEE. A COLLABORATION IN YOUR FUTURE MISTER MAYOR SEARCHING. OF WITH THE. GOOD WILL OF OUR CHAIR OF MAKING SURE THAT IT DOES GET THROUGH WITH HER APPROVAL. AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF WHAT THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE TALKING ABOUT. ALL HAVE TO SAY THAT MY EXPERIENCES WITH WITH THE STATE AUDITOR THROUGH THE DELTA CAUCUS HAS BEEN. STREAMLINED ARE PRODUCTIVE IN AN OF VALUE AND AS THE CHERISHED MENTIONED. WE ALL HIGHLY. APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE STATE AUDITOR. HOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL NOTE THAT YOU MIGHT ALSO RECOGNIZE GOING FORWARD IS? WHEN THE STATE AUDITOR IS ENGAGED IN DOES THEIR. THEIR INVESTIGATION OR HER REPORT. THAT IT COMES OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME GLARING ISSUES. FROM STATE AGENCIES. THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO BASICALLY TO. STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DEFENSE STATE AGENCIES. DOESN'T PROSECUTE. WE HAVE JUST THE ABILITY TO DEFUND HAS AS A FUNDING. BODY. OR MAKE NEW LAWS. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BOUND TO BE. CULPABLE IN IN WRONGDOINGS. THERE'S NEVER ACCOUNTABILITY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE. DON'T DO IT AGAIN. COULDN'T CASE IN POINT WAS THE. STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THE STATE WATER BOARD AN EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE CLEARLY FOUND BY THE STATE AUDITOR. NOTHING HAPPENED THERE IS NOTHING THAT. I MEAN JUST WAS IDENTIFIED SO IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE. IN. IN STATUE WERE. THE AGENCIES WERE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS WERE RESPONSIBLE. GOING FOR A FACT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I THINK THIS COMMITTEE. HAS THE CHAIR. COULD ACTUALLY SO SPEARHEAD THIS WITH YOU AS JAIL ACT. TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WHEN WHEN THINGS ARE FOUND OUT TO BE. WRONG DOINGS OF THE PUBLIC SEES THAT WE ACTUALLY ACT UPON THEM. AND THAT'S BEEN MY FRUSTRATION WHEN WE SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD. AND AND AND ENGAGE YOU WANT I CAN ALSO BUT I THINK THIS THIS COMMITTEE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL MEN TURN. IN FURTHERING THE PROCESS. OF FILE AFTER THEY DO THEIR GOOD WORK AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE. I AGREE I WOULD I'VE I'VE TALKED WITH THAT AND SPEAKER AND IN A PEOPLE ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THIS COMMITTEE MORE SOME LIKE THE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO COME BACK AND WE HEAR MUCH MORE ABOUT IT. BUT SO YEAH I DO BELIEVE THAT AGAIN TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC AWARENESS ALL OF THOSE THINGS AS WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE IS FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE CAN POSSIBLY BE. PATTERSON. I JUST BRIEFLY I I THINK THE OF. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY IS RAISED SOME. IMPORTANT AREAS HERE. OF FOR THE TIME BEING. I THINK I'M I'M GONNA LAY OFF AND AND ENCOURAGE. THE A COLLABORATION. WITH. THE SENATE AND BRINGING A SIMILAR BILL. AND THEN KIND OF SEE HOW HOW ALL THAT PULLS TOGETHER AND. SO I'LL BE LAYING OFF BUT I WANT TO CONTINUE TO. AND ENGAGE IN THE EFFORT HERE TO. TO GET THIS TO GET THIS RIGHT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIOS. RIGHT WITH EVERY EMOTION. THE TRIP WAS COLOR.

LACKEY AYE MEDINA MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. KIRK SILVA AYE. BUILDING UP THANK YOU MEMBERS. STRONG A MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS IS MY PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY ONE. A BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE REGULATORY PROCESS. I SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE MAJOR REGULATIONS WITH AN ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACT. FIFTY MILLION OR MORE. TO RETURN TO LEGISLATIVE REVIEW AND APPROVAL IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT ACT ON THE SUBMITTED REGULATION. IT WILL GO INTO EFFECT ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT RULE MAKING SCHEDULE. THIS BILL ALSO TASK REDWOOD TOO AGENCIES TO REVIEW EXISTING REGULATIONS AND IDENTIFY ANY REGULATIONS THAT ARE. THAT ARE DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING INCONSISTENT OR OUT OF DATE. AND TASK AGENCIES TO ADOPT AMENDMENTS TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES. THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED STATE AGENCIES WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE REGULATIONS AFFECTING EVERY INDUSTRY STATEWIDE. THE COST OF THESE REGULATIONS NOT ONLY IMPACT SMALL BUSINESSES BUT THEY ALSO AFFECTED FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS. LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN PARTICULAR OFTEN BEAR THE BURDEN TO HIGHER COSTS AND ESSENTIAL GOODS AND SERVICES. AS LEGISLATORS COOPER WE PROVIDE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OVER BY THE TRADE BODIES WS EXPECT TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE LAWS WE PASS. IT'S UP TO US TO KEEP OUR ELECTED BUREAUCRATS ACCOUNTABLE. THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL BRING NEEDED CHECKS AND BALANCES SO WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY REVIEW THESE REGULATIONS AND ENSURE THAT THERE ARE APPROPRIATE THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. WITH ME TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF AB TWENTY SIX ANYONE ISRAEL COOK WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATE. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE EMINEM'S TERRELL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY ONE AS A GOOD GOVERNANCE MEASURE. THAT WILL INCREASE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND IMPROVE THE REGULATORY SYSTEM UP AS A BIG PICTURE FRAMEWORK UP ALL EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTHORITY BEGINS WITH THE GRANT BY THE LEGISLATURE SO UPSET AND RULES HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW SO IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WHEN AGENCIES ARE DOING THE RULE MAKING THAT THEY DO NOT. CONTRAVENED LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AB TICKS AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTY ONE BEGINS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM UP BY CREATING A MECHANISM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IT INCREASED ITS RESPONSIBILITY IN OVERSIGHT OF THESE EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH A TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO ESTABLISH SUCH AN OVERSIGHT INTO THE. ARE CURRENTLY THE WHAT WE HAVE IS IS IN OUR EXISTING SYSTEM IS THE O. L. A IN THE OF REVIEWING AGENCY RULEMAKING UNDER THE APA BUT. A THAT REVIEW WAS A PROCEDURAL CHECK THE OIL IS NOT EQUIPPED TO MAKE EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER NOT A RULE DIVERGES FROM LEGISLATIVE INTENT ONLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO THAT. ARE CURRENTLY IF. REGULATION. DONE BY ANY AGENCY IS DIVERGENT FROM A GREG LEGISLATIVE INTENT. WHAT RESULTS IS A LENGTHY COURT PROCESS WHICH IS UNPREDICTABLE AT ITS LENGTH BE IT'S COSTLY AND AT THE END WHAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST START BOTH THE LIBERTY PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN TO CREATE AND? THAT'S NOT IDEAL FOR ANYONE AND IT DELAYED ANY POTENTIAL BENEFIT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE. ONCE THIS A MECHANISM IS IN PLACE ULTIMATELY IT IS FLEXIBLE WE HAVE SEEN AND IT'S UP TO THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE HOW ROBUST OR EFFECTIVE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE AND HOW MUCH VALUE THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD. A WE SEEN IN OTHER STATES CONNECTICUT HAS A FULL LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE DEVOTED TO REVIEWING MAJOR RULES. COLORADO HAS AN OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL SERVICES TO REVIEW WITH BERMAN IF THEY. CONTRAVENE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY WYOMING A MAIN HAVE A SIMILAR SORT PROCESS TO TO WHAT WE SEE HERE. A THE SECOND PART OF THIS BILL ARE REQUIRED THAT AGENCIES ARE REVIEW THE REGULATIONS DETERMINE ANY AT DETERMINE THAT ANY BETTER OUT OF DATE. INCONSISTENT OVERLAPPING OR DUPLICATIVE AND IF THEY ARE AGENCIES MUST RECONCILE AMEND THEIR REGULATIONS TO TO BRING THEM. IN HARMONY BUT IT'S NOT A MANDATE TO REPEAL THAT REGULATIONS THAT ARE WORKING MORE EFFECTIVE. IT ENCOURAGED AGENCIES TO TALK TO EACH OTHER TO REMOVE SILOS. INTO PROVIDE. CERTAINTY FOR REGULATED ENTITIES GIVING THEM A PLACE A SINGLE PLACE TO GO TO. AND AND CLEAR A CLEAR PATH THE COMPLAINTS SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOU TO VOTE ISLAND BILL TODAY. MAYBE SPEAK IN A POSITION TODAY. WELL. BEN CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL A WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD PREFER MOSQUITO RESOURCES FROM STATE AGENCIES TO PERFORM. DUPLICATIVE AND NECESSARY REGULATORY REVIEWS. THERE'S ALREADY A VIGOROUS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THEIR RATES ARE CONSISTENT NOT DUPLICATIVE. WIND THE STATE AGENCIES WHO ARE CREATES THE RULE OR CREATES A REGULATION HAS BIGGEST PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE WITH. CURRENT LAW OF THE AWAY YELL BENDER EXISTING LAW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE RULES REGULATIONS ARE CONSISTENT AND NOT DUPLICATIVE AND MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE APA. AND LASTLY THERE IS ALSO A VIGOROUS PROCESS FOR IF SOMEHOW REGULATION US THAT THE CRACKS IN DOESN'T YOU IT ISN'T IDENTIFIED THROUGH. THE PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES WE CAN ASSIST THAT I JUST DISCUSSED OF THERE IS A PROCESS WHERE OF THE PUBLIC CAN ASK THE AGENCY TO REPEAL A REGULATION IS A PROCESS WHERE THE LEGISLATURE CAN INITIATE. A PRIORITY REVIEW TO RECRUIT REPEAL THE REGULATION THERE ARE. SEVERAL LAYERS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE UNDERLYING LAW THAT THIS ALLEGED THAT THIS BODY PASSES AND THEY'RE REGULATION THAT'S A. THAT'S A APPROVED A MEETS THE STANDARDS OF THE APA IT NEEDS THE APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL THAT VIOS THIS BODY ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COME BACK AND SAY NO STATE AGENCY YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. WE'RE GONNA PASSABLE DIRECTING YOU TO. DO EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE STUDIES DONE THAT WORK THEY'VE. PASSED LEGISLATION TO SPECIFICALLY DIRECT A AN AGENCY TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASKS SO I IT'S OUR VIEW THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS IS WORKING. AND DEAD. THE DANGERS COMPONENT OF DIVERTING THOSE STATE RESOURCES TO PERFORM THIS DUPLICATIVE REVIEW MEANS THAT STATE AGENCIES ARE PERFORMING THEIR CORE MISSION SO THE LABOR AGENCY ISN'T BITING WASTE BETH CALTRANS IS IN BUILDING ROADS. DID DEAL JAY IS IN DEFENDING OUR LAWS THEY HAVE TO DIVERT RESOURCES FROM PERFORMING THEIR CORE MISSION TO DO WHERE I REGULATORY REGULATORY REVIEW THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BY THE AGENCY AND I WAS ALREADY AND BY THE AWAY ILL. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL LYFT ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH A PREVIOUS BECAUSE COMMENTS IS THAT TWO POINTS FIRST OF ALL. THIS LEGISLATURE AND YOUR PREDECESSORS. HAVE AGREED THAT THERE ARE. BUT THINGS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE AND THEN BILLS YOU DON'T NEED TO GET GRANULAR ON WHAT. A A SPECIFIC LAW SHOULD LOOK LIKE REGULATION SHOULD LOOK LIKE YOU PASS A LAW YOU PASS A BILL. AND YOU LEAVE IT TO AN AGENCY. WHO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS AN AGENCY WHO HANDLES THAT AREA OF LIFE AN AREA OF LAW? TO CREATE WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BASED ON WHAT YOUR BILL SAID. AND YOU KNOW WE SAW THIS JUST LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO AT THE HEAT ON THIS REGULATION YOU GUYS PASSED A LAW THAT SAID. CAL OSHA SHALL DO HE ALMOST REGULATION BY A CERTAIN DATE YOU DIDN'T TALK ABOUT TEMPERATURES IN TALK ABOUT HUMIDITY YOU DIDN'T GET INTO THE DETAILS. YOU JUST CENTER DIRECTION AND I WOULD JUST STAY WITH CAL OSHA FOR SECOND AND PICK UP ON A POINT OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID BY SAYING. OUR DEBATE ON THE DAY THERE'S AROUND TWO HUNDRED CAL OSHA INSPECTORS FOR SEVENTEEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE STATE. THOSE INSPECTORS ARE IN THE FIELD ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT DO THE REGULATIONS THEY COME OUT FROM THE FIELD TO WORK ON REGULATIONS THAT THEY ARE EXPERTS IN. IF YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS. AND. BY THE LEGISLATURE'S INTO LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDER THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB AS WELL THEY SHOULD AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE IN THE FIELD. ENFORCING REGULATIONS LIKE THEY SHOULD SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE ALSO OPPOSED THANK YOU THINK YOU'RE MUCH ELSE BEGIN OPPOSITION TODAY. A MAN CHAIR MEMBERS A COMMISSION DOESN'T ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION AT THE MACHINIST UNITE HERE. AND UTILITY WORKERS UNION ALL POST. MARK MCKINNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION ON THAT FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED BY ON THE OPPOSITION WE TOO ARE ALSO OPPOSED. OKAY. GUM SO I I I WILL SAY I HAVE. HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS. BUT I WE SEE IT IS UNNECESSARY WE WE PASSED THE BILL'S WE WE DO THAT LEGISLATION AGENCIES IMPLEMENT THEM WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THEM BACK IS IT IT'S COMMITTEE OR TO BRING THEM BACK OR TO DO MORE LEGISLATION. AND WE'VE WE HAVE CERTAINLY DONE UP MULTIPLE TIMES OF ALL SET ON OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES WE HAVE AGENCIES COMMAND WITH THE BEAT NAY ARE BE ARE OR WHOM EVER. IS THE SAME COMMENTS I MADE TO YOU LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT THIS BILL UP. YOU DIDN'T. EVEN TRY TO NARROW INTRODUCED IN WITH THE POLICY CONCERNS IT'S SAME BILL THAT WE. THE DID MAKE IT LAST YEAR AND NOW IT'S BACK AGAIN THIS YEAR SO. IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT WANTING TO DO MORE OF THIS A OVERSIGHT AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU FIND A BETTER WAY TO TAILOR IT DOWN TO MAKE IT MORE FUNCTIONAL AND NOT JUST CREATE A LOT OF BUSY WORK FOR PEOPLE. OUT MOST AGENCIES ARE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK. SO. AND A QUESTION TO COLLEGE IN THE COMMITTEE. BOB. WELL I'M GONNA. SPECULATE YEAH. HAD DISAGREE WITH THAT WITH THE CHAIR. AND WE ARE WE HAVE REGULATORY. PROBLEMS THAT ARE DEEP AND WIDE ACROSS ALMOST EVERY DIVISION OR DEPARTMENT. AB IF THE PROCESS PRESENTLY IN PLACE WOULD WOULD WOULD BE WORKING WE WOULD NOT HAVE. ALL OF THE CONFUSION IN THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE DO PRESENTLY MY AS SITE. JUST ONE. A OUTDATED DATA SET OF REGULATIONS ITS TITLE TWENTY TO WITH RESPECT TO OF. HEALTH DELIVERY AND THE LIKE REPEATEDLY. HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND OTHERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH AT A REGULAR EFFORT TO WAVE. NONSENSICAL RULES AND REGULATIONS DUPLICATIVE OF VERY EXPENSIVE. THERE ARE WAIVER PROCESSES. IN IT. BUT IT IS YOU TALK ABOUT TIME CONSUMING AND YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE BUREAUCRACIES HAVING TO DO. A UNNECESSARY WORK AND NOT BE ABLE TO DO THEIR. PRIMARY FUNCTION. THESE WAIVERS ARE JUST SUCH AN EXAMPLE THEY ARE ROUTINELY WAIVED AS IF THE REGULATIONS DON'T EXIST WELL THE REASON FOR THAT IS. THOSE REGULATIONS WERE MAY BE PASSED IN THE NINETEEN X. THESE LAST TIME THEY WERE REFORM WAS IN THE NINETEEN. SEVENTIES AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN A IT FOR HOSPITALS IN MY DISTRICT THAT. UTTERLY UNNECESSARY. FINES AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT EVEN THE MEMBERS OF THE BUREAUCRACY APOLOGIZE TO THE HOSPITAL'S FOR HAVING. UP TO PUT FORWARD THERE HAS TO BE THIS KIND OF. OVERSIGHT A. BECAUSE OF THE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE RIGHT. AND ARE AT. IDENTIFIED ALMOST REGULARLY BY MEMBERS. WHO HAVE ANY KIND OF ENGAGEMENT WITH CONSTITUENTS IN THE AREA THAT THIS THIS IS I THINK APPROPRIATE? AT AN ALLY AND I THINK THAT DEAD. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT. OF THE REGULATORY REFORM AND MODERNIZATION THAT WE WOULD BE EMBRACING EN ENGAGING. TO TRY TO GET THE THESE KIND OF VEHICLES. IN PLACE OR ELSE WE'RE JUST GONNA CONTINUE TO. RUN AROUND IN CIRCLES WITH THESE CRAZY WAIVERS AND. FINDS THAT ARE TIED TO REGULATIONS THAT EVEN THE REGULATORS DON'T THINKER PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE SO FOR THOSE REASONS I. I THOUGHT I SUPPORT THE BILL AND AND WOULD HOPE THAT. THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD DOESN'T GIVE A GOOD IDEA FOR A BILL NEXT YEAR MR. ON A WAIVERS. OKAY ANYBODY ELSE MISS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER FONG UP FOR THIS PRESENTATION YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT BILL I I KNOW THAT IN THE SCOPE OF THIS BUILDING IT MAY NOT BE ON ANYBODY'S RADAR. BUT AS THAT. BUT CHAIR OF THE JOBS COMMITTEE THIS IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE WE HEAR MANY MANY TIMES US OUT. A DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS BUT AGAIN LOOKING AT WHETHER IT BE SMALL OR LARGE BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY SO I'M NOT TALKING NECESSARILY ABOUT. A GOVERNMENT BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES. THEY OFTEN JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO WEED THROUGH. AND WE HEAR OFTEN SOMETIMES MAYBE TO AN EXTREME ABOUT EVERYBODY. MOVING TO TEXAS I DON'T ARIZONA I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE I KNOW THAT WE ARE INNOVATIVE HERE AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. A AS PEOPLE LEAVE PEOPLE ARE COMING. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CONTINUE TO HEAR AS A THEME I NOT ONLY LOCALLY BUT I HAVE DONE MANY MANY BUSINESS TOWARD TAURUS IS. JUST THEY'RE NOT SURE ABOUT WHERE TO START AND WE HAVE WORKED IN THE JOBS COMMITTEE ON THINGS LIKE MASTER BUSINESS LICENCE SO THAT THEY CAN GO ON. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS UP AN OLD PIECE OF LEGISLATION MAYBE WHAT'S SOMETHING NEW ON TOP OF THAT WHAT'S UP SOMETHING NEW THAT THEY HAVE TO. ADJUST TO AND SO I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LET'S GO AHEAD AND AUDIT AGENCIES AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND MAKE SURE. THEY'RE FOLLOWING UP AND THEM WERE SAYING WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT IN THIS CASE SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY FACE THE FACT THAT IF WE DON'T START TO LOOK. AT ALL OF THE. LAYERS AND LAYERS UPON UP LEGISLATION THERE'S JUST A POINT WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY BUT ALSO OTHER EMPLOYERS. THEN EXAMPLE IS I MET WITH A MANUFACTURER FURNITURE. pFURNITURE IS NOT MADE HERE ANYMORE ONES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO. DO THEIR WORK THEY TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMING INTO THEIR BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE GETTING FINE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A POSTER ON THE WALL. UP ABOUT SOMETHING SO WE'RE TRYING WHEN I SAY SOMETHING REGULATION I MEAN. FOR EXAMPLE UP. WHERE IT MADE THESE THINGS SO I AM I AM I REALLY AM CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS SO AT THIS POINT I'M GONNA STAY OFF BUT? I I WOULD I KNOW WE I HAVE MANY LABOR FRIENDS. OUT THERE THAT THAT I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THEIR. LOGIC ON THIS BUT WE HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE EMPLOYERS WE DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES. ANYBODY ELSE. JOINT CLOSE CERTAINLY UP MEMBERS ARE AT IT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WITH WE'VE TAILORED THIS. PILL. AS WHO OF TO SET THE THRESHOLD THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC COSTS TO THE STATE. OR MORE AND SO AT THE NUMBER OF REGULATIONS I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA REVIEW. WILL PUBLIC P. LESS THAN TEN AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE ENTIRE ECONOMY THAT'S FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WORK TO THE ENTIRE STATE. AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD ALWAYS ENCOURAGED AGENCIES A TO LOOK BACK AND SEE IF THERE ARE CONFLICTING REGULATIONS. THAT NEED TO BE MODERNIZED OR STREAMLINED. AYE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS. WITH NUMEROUS MEMBERS ABOUT AND AND MOST OF THE BILLS THAT WE WILL WE INTRODUCE OUR BILLS THAT WERE MODERNIZING SINCE. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKED AT SINCE THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SO IT IT THIS IN AND MY MIND IS A BILL THAT IS VERY COMMON SENSE. I WAS LOOKING WORK WERE ENCOURAGING AGENCIES. TO LOOK BACK IN STREAMLINED. THE PROCESS HE'S A TO ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T DUPLICATIVE OF. LAWS OR REGULATIONS AS SO THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE US BUT BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES A THAT CAN COMPLY. WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE BUT ALSO MOVE FORWARD WE ARE THE ELECTED BODY. AND TWO TWO FOUR FTA WE SHOULD BE AS THAT AS A LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGING ACCOUNTABILITY ENCOURAGING OVERSIGHT AS AS YOU MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED BEFORE TO HAVE THIS COMMITTEE SERVE LIKE THE CONGRESSIONAL. OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AT THIS IS BASED THERE THERE ARE. BASIE'S OF THIS BILL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT. AND SO THIS. DOES PROVIDE MORE OVERSIGHT AND MORE TRANSPARENCY WHICH I THINK THE PUBLIC DESERVES SO I ENCOURAGE ABSENT WE ASK WHAT I THOUGHT. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS THAT AMOUNT THAT'S EGGMAN. FELLOW MONTH AS A MINNOW PATTERSON. PATTERSON AYE BURKE. FRAZIER. FRAZIER NO LACKEY. LACKEY AYE MEDINA. MEDINA NO KIRK SELMA. HURT SOMEONE NOT LOADING. YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN CAUGHT. A DOCTOR WEBER. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE. YES. GOOD MORNING CHAIR EGGMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE REGARDING SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'VE AGREED TO THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE TIME OF BEEN TO IS AN ELIGIBLE TO CONTRACT. BUT NOT COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. WE'VE ALSO MADE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THE TRIGGER FOR THE UC TO BE ABLE TO IN A NON COMPLIANCE WITH TO BE IN NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE BILL. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TEMPORARY WORKERS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AN IMMIGRANT OR PERSON OF COLOR. THEY'RE EARNING LOWER WAGES WITH FEWER IF NO BENEFITS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO RELY UPON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE'S WHAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S CONTRACTING PRACTICES ARE CONDEMNING LOW WAGE EMPLOYEES TO POVERTY AND A RELIANCE ON TAX FUNDED SOCIAL SERVICES. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT KEEP TRACK AND DOES NOT KEEP RECORDS. SO WE'RE PROPOSING A MECHANISM FOR TRANSPARENCY FOR THE UNIVERSITY. BIN IS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH EMPLOYEE'S PAY AND BENEFITS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CHANCES OFFICE. THE CHANCES OFFICE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO POST THIS INFORMATION ON A PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE. IF THE VENDOR FAILS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR TWO YEARS. IF UNIVERSITY AT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO CONTRACT WITH VENDORS WOULD NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL THE LEGISLATURE WILL DEDUCT THE AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT FROM THEIR BUDGET ALLOCATION. THIS WOULD PROVIDE CLARITY ABOUT WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY IS ENFORCING ITS OWN MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES AND WHETHER THESE EMPLOYEES RECEIVE ANY HEALTH OR RETIREMENT BENEFITS. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW THE LAWMAKERS TO GAUGE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CONTRACTS SHE OF COST TO THE STATE BY THESE EMPLOYEES HAVING NOTE RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO SUPPORT THE BILL IS CLAUDIA PER PRODUCT FROM ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE. AND ALSO JULIA WATERS FROM ASK ME FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU. FIRST PRODUCED BECAUSE SUPPORT PLEASE. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MONEY WAS CLAUDIA PER PRADA AND I'M THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR OUSTING LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE. THE LARGEST UNION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SERVICE IN PATIENT CARE TECHNICAL WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE UC SYSTEM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I'M HERE TO REGISTER THE UNION SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE WHICH QUITE SIMPLY REQUEST THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN A PUBLICLY X. A ASSESSABLE DATABASE OF ITS CDVA SERVICE CONTRACTORS. THE ANTENNA OF THE LEGISLATION IS TWO FOLD FIRST PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE A VEHICLE TO MONITOR UC'S PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE STATE AUDITOR'S CRITICISMS OF ITS CONTRACTING OUT PRACTICES. AND SECOND CONFIRM THE EXTENT OF UC'S USE OF LOW WHICH CONTRACTORS. LAST YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND UC'S CONTRACTING OUT. RESULTS NOT JUST IN THE DISPLACEMENT BUT ALSO IN THE AVOIDANCE OF HIRING YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS. YOU SEE CONTRACTORS ARE PAID UP TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS LESS THAN YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS DURING COMPARABLE WORK. UC'S OUTSOURCING OF SERVICE WORK IS NOT JUST TEMPORARY. ADDITIONALLY YOU SEE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY MEASURE SUPPORT COST SAVINGS ARE EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM OUTSOURCING. AND YOU SEE RENEWS CONTRACTS REPEATEDLY OFTEN WITHOUT HEARING TO COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS. THEREFORE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED UNDER AB TWENTY THREE SIX. ONE WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS THE ABILITY TO MONITOR UC'S PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING. THE AUDITOR'S CONCERNS. THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE AFFECTED ONLY IF IT FAILS TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTOR DATA OR FAILS TO DECLARE AN UNCOOPERATIVE CONTRACTOR UNQUALIFIED BETTER FOR FUTURE WORK IN OTHER WORDS. YOU SEE CAN AVOID CONSEQUENCE BY TAKING SIMPLE AND REASONABLE STOPS. LASTLY THE UNION'S RESEARCH REPORT FINDS THAT THE AVERAGE STARTING PAY FOR LATINO BLACK WORKERS IN AUS THREE REPRESENTED TITLES IS AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT LOWER THAN WHITE WORKERS AND THAT THE NUMBER OF BLACK WORKERS AT UC HAS DECREASED BY THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. WHILE CONTRACTOR SURVEYS SUGGEST OUTSOURCED WORKERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK THAN YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS. AS A THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE UC'S A DRIVER BOTH SOCIAL MOBILITY INEQUALITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ITS EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES HAVE IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE THEREFORE SHINING A LIGHT. ON ITS CONTRACTING OUT PRACTICES IS A MATTER OF STATE WHAT CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU EXCURSIONS BEGIN SUPPORT. OKAY SO TECHNICALLY TECHNICAL TECHNICALLY ONE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT IT WAS BEGIN OPPOSITION TODAY. THERE'S MORE SUPPORTS MORE SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAP RIGHT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS AND SPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ROUGHLY HER SUPPORT. JUDGE WILL WILL GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES AND SUPPORT. ANYWAY SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE MISTER MEDIA. A THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK IT IS MUCH NEEDED. I I THINK AS LONG AS YOU SEE. ENGAGES IN CONTRACTING OUT. THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE CONCERNED AND RIGHTLY SO. I I I HEARD ABOUT. VALET PARKERS AT UCLA WHO WERE BEING PAID SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. THEN YOU SEE OTHER UCLA EMPLOYEES AND AND AND AND AND ACTUALLY LOST THEIR JOBS. DURING THE PROCESS. I'VE WE HEARD THE BILL AND AND HIGHER EDUCATION WE'RE GOT THROUGH A QUESTION THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU TOOK I THINK MAKE THE BILL OF BETTER WHO. IT IT WORKED WITH YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT AND. IN THE PART OF THE IF I. AND IF YOU WOULD CLARIFY FOR ME. THAT. IT WOULD ONLY. PASSED THAT MANY BE KEPT FROM YOU SEE IF THEY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN IT IF THEY HAD THE INFORMATION AND FAILED TO PROVIDE IT MY. CORRECT IN THAT SO THE CONTRACTORS FAILED TO GIVE THEM THE INFORMATION. THERE WOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR. INFORMATION THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE MY RIGHT AND RECOMMEND THEY WOULD NOT THAT BE PENALIZED IF THEY CONTINUE TO CONTRACT WITH SOMEONE WHO REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH HIM. I I I I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I SUPPORT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND WILL SUPPORT IT AGAIN IN THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THEY CONSIDER IT A MOTION. TREASURY THINK MADAM CHAIR. SO I'VE SEEN THIS BILL IN THE SNIFFER FARMS ARE. THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN VETOED AND I'VE SUPPORTED EACH AND EVERY TIME. OF AS A FORMER CONTRACTOR INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIAN. UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN TEMPORARY WORKER AND AND FULL TIME. EMPLOYEE WHOSE VESTED IN AND LOYAL AND AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT COME WITH THAT. NOT TO DISPARAGE THE TEMPORARY WORK FORCE I MEAN THAT THEY HAVE A. A PLACE TO TO TO FIT INTO THIS MOBILE. WE WE LOOK IT TIME FRAMES THAT. WE'VE NOT COME TO A DEFINITION WHERE THEY IT'S UC'S MUST GO TO A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE. WE ALL WE'VE GONE AND SAID THERE. AT NEW REPORTING IN ALL OF THIS. BUT I MEAN THERE HAS TO BE A JUSTIFICATION SAVE. THAT I'M A TEMPORARY PLACE SIXTEEN NINETY WHATEVER THE DETERMINATION. THAT WORKS FOR BOTH SIDES I GUESS BUT LET'S GET TO THE HAD POINT AND AND AND AND FINALIZES. A NEW GOVERNOR'S VETO THIS EACH AND EVERY TIME AND I HOPE YOU'VE ADDRESSED. THE VETO MESSAGE AGAIN. BUT. I MEAN THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE. WE WHEN WE NEED FELONS THAT'S WHEN WE USE THE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES RIGHT OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS GAINED BY FULL TIME IN PLACES ABSOLUTELY VALUABLE. BUT LET'S FIGURE OUT A DETERMINATION ON THE DATE OF. WHEN TEMPORARY STOPS IN FULL TIME NEEDS TO BE AT HOME BOOK I WILL AGAIN SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I HOPE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL. THROUGHOUT THE PATH. BUT. LET'S WORK ON THAT TOO. WE'RE IN AGREEMENT. THANK YOU. I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE THE COMMITTEE. OKAY DOT WEBER LIKE CLOTHES SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE COMMENTS AND FOR THOSE WHO CAME UP TO SUPPORT AND FOR ASK ME FOR COSTLY WORKING ON THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE. EUROPE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE AND AT THIS HOUSE IN IN THIS IN THIS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IS. WHAT WE THINK WILL ELECT ELIMINATE POVERTY AND AND HELP FOLKS TO GO ON TO DEVELOP AND SO THEREFORE IT BECOMES IMPORTANT WE DON'T HAVE? A ONE MESSAGE THAT WE PUT OUT THERE AND THEN WE HAVE ONE OF OUR MAJORS EMPLOYERS DOING SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND CREATING POVERTY IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE RATHER THAN IT INSISTING US. LIFTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE POT OUT OF POVERTY SO TWENTYTHREE SIXTY ONE IS REALLY ABOUT TRANSPARENCY INITIALLY NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO KEEP GOOD RECORDS AND SO THEREFORE. I DON'T OPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING IN OUR FIGHTING BUT WE NEED TO BRING CHANGE ABOUT THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS FOR DOING THAT. UP SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I BUILD FORTS AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY ONE THING TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE. VICTOR WAS COLOR. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED AND BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS THAT AMOUNT THIS EGGMAN. THAT AMOUNT IS EGGMAN I'VE PATTERSON BURKE. BURKE I'VE FRAZIER FRAZIER AYE LACKEY LACKEY NO MEDINA. MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA QUIRK SILVA AYE. IF YOU'RE A MEASURE GOES UP. AND I SEE MISS WALDRON OUT THERE. SWELLED WEDNESDAY'S PRESENTING. TWENTY EIGHTY SEVEN THAT DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION SUPPORT SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM VERY EXCITED TO ACTUALLY PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY IN SOME. COUPLE YEARS IN THE WORKS. TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHTY SEVEN A BILL TO BRING CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE. CALIFORNIA IS WOEFULLY BEHIND IN MAKING USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS IMPROVE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. OUR STATE MUST ENCOURAGE MODERNIZATION TO CREATE FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACES REDUCE SPENDING INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AND CYBERSECURITY STREAMLINE PROCESSES AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. INNOVATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP LEGISLATIVE JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH OPERATE EFFICIENTLY AND ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORKFORCE AND CREATE THE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY WE NEED. AND CALIFORNIA'S MISSING OUT AND SO MANY OF THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODERNIZE WORKPLACE AND I JUST WANNA TO SQUEEZE THEN. THE ISSUE OF WOMEN AND A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAD DONE AN OFFSITE MEETING I. WAS ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE PRESENTED IN ITS SHOWS ONE OF THE BARRIERS TO WOMEN. BEING IN THE EVEN ELECTED OFFICE ORDER THE THE BARRIERS TO WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE. AND IT SAYS THAT ABOUT SEVEN IN TEN AMERICANS SEVENTY ONE PERCENT SAY THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES TO GIVE MEN AND WOMEN EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THE VIEW THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO CONTINUE MAKING CHANGES TO ACHIEVE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE THIS PARTICULAR COMMON AMONG WOMEN SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND I BELIEVE TECHNOLOGY A MODERNIZING THAN LOOKING AT EVEN ON THE LEGISLATURE THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS THE EFFICIENCIES THE SCHEDULES. THINGS LIKE THAT COULD BE LOOKED. THE ADMINISTRATIVELY ADJUSTED FROM. WHY DOES THE SENATE THE LAST TIME WE AMENDED THE BILL ON THE SIDE OF FLOOR THEY WANTED TEN PRINTED COPIES SO THEY COULD CUT AND PASTE? WHY CAN'T THE D. M. V. PROVIDE THE DEAL FORTY FOUR FORM FOR ANYONE WHO HAS A CHILD LEARNING TO DRIVE IF THE CALL IS IN ON THE PHONE THEY DON'T HAVE IT AT THE? AT THE DMV YOU CAN'T GET IT ONLINE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE COULD CHANGE. BECAUSE TODAY I HAVE GENERAL COOK FROM THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION TO SUPPORT THE BILL. MISTER COOK. THANK YOU THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MANY MISTRAL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE HEAR TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY. EIGHTY SEVEN UP. I'M HERE TO JUST GIVE A IN THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE ON WHY THIS NOW IF YOU. BY STATES AND GOVERNMENTS. ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE WE CAN RELY ON THE STATE TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DELIVER DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT WE RELY UPON AYE IT ENCOURAGES US TO LOCATE. OUR FACILITIES AND EXPAND OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AYE IT'S ALSO. IN ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE STATE GOVERNMENT WILL BE INVESTING IN ARE PRODUCED BY CALIFORNIA COMPUTER AND ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURERS WHICH ARE PIONEERS IN LEADING THE WORLD INNOVATION. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE BUT THAT THE THE PITFALLS OF NOT MODERNIZING CAN BE SEEN. IN OTHER STATES BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE NEWS WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OUT OF BOB. ATLANTA GEORGIA WHICH THAT I'M. FAMILIAR WITH THE SPEND WHAT TIME IN A THEY CURRENTLY SUFFERED. THEY THOUGHT SUFFERED A CYBER ATTACK EARLIER IN APRIL WHICH SHUT DOWN. CITY GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THEM TO GO BACK TO PAPER AND PENCIL TO TO DELIVER CITY. SERVICES THAT AND IT SHUT DOWN PUBLIC EMERGENCY SERVICES SO THE FAILURE TO MODERNIZE HAS EXTREME PITFALLS FOR OUR STATE. GOVERNMENT AND MODERNIZING ONLY PRODUCES BENEFITS WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF BILL ME COURAGE AND YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU MUCH YOU KNOW SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. AND BASS BEGIN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NOW I THINK IT'S A FINE BILL AND I HAVE BEEN VIRTUALLY PAPERLESS SINCE I'VE STARTED HERE AND IT DID IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO AND BUT PEOPLE STILL TRY THROW PAPER AT MEALTIME. I'VE TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST IT. A I MAYBE ONE DAY BELIEVE BUILDER TELECOMMUTE AS THE LEGISLATURE. JOKING RIGHT UP THAT BIG OFF SOME. IT DOESN'T ENJOYED YOU PASSING A US SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON RULES THAT AMOUNT THIS EGGMAN ELEMENT THAT EGGMAN AYE PATTERSON. BURKE. BURKE AYE FRAZIER. FRAZIER AYE LACKEY LACKEY AYE MEDINA MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA QUIRK SILVA AYE. THE BILL'S OUT SWANKY FROM GRADUATION. BONTA GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES. AND STAFF I THINK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE TODAY TWENTY SEVEN FORTY NINE WOULD SIMPLY ADD. MOBILE FRIENDLY THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE TO ENSURE THAT STATE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES ACCESSIBLE. TO THOSE WITH A MOBILE DEVICE THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A SECTION THAT ENSURES FUTURE STATE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES WILL BE MOBILE FRIENDLY AS WELL THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ACCESS ISSUE GOOD GOVERNMENT ISSUE EQUITY ISSUE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I THINK YOU'RE MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WE COULDN'T OF SUPPORT TODAY. THE COMMAND CHAIR ROB GROWS CLOSER WITH ADOBE. AT ADOBE WE BELIEVE THAT. GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE SENSIBLE BY ALL INDIVIDUALS AND WE THINK THE SUCH SECTOR FOR THE COMMITMENT TO THAT ACCESS AND LIKE TO THINK IT'S SUMMER. BONTA FOR FURTHERING IT WITH THIS LEGISLATION THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING ON THE SO SMART PHONES AND SPECIAL WITH YOUNG FOLKS AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES VISION TWENTY TWENTY PLAN. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT CODIFIES THIS LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT FOR MOBILE FRIENDLY THANK YOU. THIS PERSON. GOOD MORNING JOHN FLORES WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WESTERN CENTER REPRESENTS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING MANY THAT YOU STATE ARE COUNTY ADMINISTERED PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE I'LL CAO WORKS CAL FRESH. IN COUNTY BENEFITS PROGRAMS MANY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE PERSONAL COMPUTERS ARE SMART AND SMARTPHONES ARE THE ONLY MEANS OF ACCESSING GOVERNMENT WEBSITE. LAST YEAR THERE'S A BIT OF A KERFUFFLE MADE DURING THAT DEBATE ABOUT REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN A CONGRESS PERSON SAID MAYBE IT LOW INCOME PEOPLE SHOULD BY HEALTH INSURANCE INSTEAD OF BUYING IPHONES. WELL THE FACT IS THAT THE SMARTPHONE IS OFTEN THEIR LAND LINE IT'S OFTEN THEIR PERSONAL COMPUTER AND SOME OF THE CLIENTS THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE REPRESENTED. THE PHONE PART OF IT DOESN'T EVEN WORK BUT THEY'RE USING THE WIFI PART FOR THEIR SOUL COMMUNICATION WITH. YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH. SO THIS AT IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT EQUITY ISSUE AND THEN FOR THAT ANOTHER PIECE OF THE BILL DOES IS LOOKING AT THE DISABILITY ACCESS AS WELL BEFORE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE GOES LIVE. AND I KNOW FOR A LOT OF SENIORS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH THEY WOULD UC'S WEBSITES MORE BUT THEY CAN'T SEE THEM. SUPPOSED TO ADD THAT PIECE IN IS ALSO IMPORTANT. AND THEN RECENTLY A WESTERN CENTER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH D. H. CS AND COVERED CALIFORNIA ON IMPROVING THE COW HERE'S COMPUTER SYSTEM. AND DURING THAT PROCESS WE WERE LOOKING AT BOTH THEIR WEBSITE AND THE MOBILE SITE AT THE SAME TIME. AND ACTUALLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF MAKING THE WEBSITE BETTER FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT A SMALL SCREEN AND YOU REALIZE YOU CAN ONLY FIT SO MUCH INFORMATION ON IT. YOU HAVE TO BE SUCCINCT AND YOU HAVE TO PUT INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN DIE JUSTICE. SO WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. GIVE ANYBODY ELSE BEGIN SUPPORT TODAY. ANYBODY SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THE COMMISSION THE COMMITTEE. AS AS A MOM OF FOUR MILLENNIALS HERE WHEN I SAY THE HOT WATER IN THEIR TWENTIES. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THEY USE TO. COMMUNICATE AND LESS IS MORE MEANING ONE WORD. BUT. PARTICULARLY FOR BOYS HOW ARE YOU FINE. BUT I THINK THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT ITS COMPANION TO WE JUST HEARD WE HAVE TO UPDATE IN MOVE. BLOOD SO THAT. EVERYBODY CAN BE PART OF GETTING INFORMATION THANK YOU. I WASN'T UP OF. BUT WITH ONE OF THE NONPROFIT SO I WORK WITH CERTAIN IN MY DISTRICT CONCILIO AND THEY WERE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE THAT THEY WERE MOVING THEIR WEBSITE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT BE. A SMARTPHONE ASSESSABLE JUST BECAUSE THEY THEY REALIZE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SERVE EVEN THOUGH THE PGA SENIORS MAY NOT HAVE IT BUT THE THEIR KIDS HAVE AN IPHONE. AND THAT IF THE AND IF THEY CAN'T DOESN'T COME UP THEY CAN'T FIND THE AGENCY. SO I THINK IT'S A IMPERATIVE IN AND SMART AND STATE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOLLOW. WE GOT CLOSE MISTER BOND RESPECT AFTER I DON'T THINK THE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BUT A MONTH AS EGGMAN PIE AND A MONTH EGGMAN AYE PATTERSON. BURKE BURKE I FRAZIER FRAZIER AYE LACKEY LACKEY AYE MEDINA. MEDINA AYE QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE. A BILLS OUT THANK YOU MISTER BONTA EGGMAN CARE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THAT YOU STAFF IF YOU MISTER CALDERON YOU. ALL WAS PRESENTING AB TWENTY NINE SEVEN ONE. AGAIN DEALING WITH. REGULATIONS AND REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT. WELCOME BACK TO SCOTT. TAKE MY TIME AND READ MY COMMENTS VERY SLOWLY IT'S ALLOW MISTER COOLEY ENOUGH I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING AT A RALLY RIGHT NOW SO ATHLETES GET. I THAT YOU MET YOUR MEMBERS. MAINTAINING A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INNOVATION IS WELCOMED AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE OBSERVED IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S THRIVING ECONOMY HOWEVER CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES SHARE A COMMON COMPLAINT REGARDING THE CHALLENGES POSED. BY THE MULTITUDE OF STATE REGULATIONS OVER TIME THE STATUTES THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY PASSES AN AXE CAN RESULT IN DUPLICATE OF A CONSISTENT OR AND OUTDATED REGULATIONS WHICH CAN DISCOURAGE INNOVATION. AND NEW BUSINESS VENTURES THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS BY CONDUCTING A ONE TIME TOP TO BOTTOM THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL STATE REGULATIONS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY WITHOUT UNDERMINING PUBLIC PROTECTIONS. DUPLICATIVE BEEN INCONSISTENT REGULATIONS DISCOURAGE INNOVATION AND NEW BUSINESS VENTURES WHILE CONTRIBUTING MINIMALLY. PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS THE ENVIRONMENT AN EMPLOYEE'S AB TWENTY NINE SEVEN ONE WILL LEAD TO MORE STREAMLINED REGULATIONS IMPROVE GOVERNANCE OVERALL BY IDENTIFYING UNNECESSARY NOT DATA REGULATIONS. YOU KNOW THE POINT OF THE BILL IS THAT WE HEAR ALL THE TIME WE TALKED TO DIFFERENT BUSINESS VENTURES WHETHER BIG OR SMALL BUSINESSES IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHERE IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE THIS REGULATION ABOUT A COMPLAIN WITH THIS REGULATION AND. SO I BASICALLY JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE ARE AND PAY THE FINE FOR THE OTHER ONE FOR BEING BY IN VIOLATION OF THAT OTHER REGULATION AND SO THE POINT OF THE BILL IS JUST. TO KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S IT IT'S A STUDY BILL. TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE DAY REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OTHER DUPLICATIVE WHETHER IDENTICAL REGULATIONS THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE SIMILAR IN NATURE TO DO THE SAME THING. OR ARE THEIR OUTDATED REGULATIONS AND WE WE HAD TERM LIMITED TIMES WHERE MEMBERS ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING BILLS ARE CONSTANTLY PASSING MEASURES ARE. AND THERE COULD BE ON THE BOOKS OUTDATED REGULATIONS THAT ARE NO LONGER ACTIVE AYE RELEVANT TODAY AND TODAY'S JOB MARKET THIS ISN'T UNDERMINING TYPE WORKER PROTECTION OR DO ANYTHING ELSE. OTHER THAN JUST SAID NO BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND YOU KNOW WHAT EVEN IF THE CITY COMES BACK AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT UPDATED OUR. OR RELEVANT REGULATIONS ON THE BOOK WILL GOOD AT LEAST WE DIDN'T KNOW BUT AT LEAST IT GIVES US THE POWER IS THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE A STEADY LOOK AT IT AND TAKE ANY ACTION OR MAYBE TAKE NO ACTION AT ALL. BUT RELEASED JUSTIN ALLEN THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND LIKE INTRODUCED MY JOINT AUTHOR. OUT THERE WITH ME TODAY MISTER COOLEY AND ALSO HAVE NATURAL COOK REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY SOCIO XIN DEFENSIVE LINE SUPPORT. TO COOLEY. WELL I'M. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE AND TEST TRANSPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE. THAT WE SHOULD ASK AGENCIES TO LOOK FOR DUPLICATIVE INCONSISTENT OUTDATED. INCOMPATIBLE REGULATIONS. I ACTUALLY THINK ARE AS MAJORITY LEADER JUST SAID THIS IS A PART OF US. LONGER TERM MEMBER SORT OF A CERTAIN THE DIGNITY OF GOVERNMENTS ARE RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT VITAL PUBLIC FUNCTION. AND. I THINK MORE VITAL TODAY THEN PERHAPS AT ANY OTHER TIME. I HAVE IN MY HAND. AND I'M FLOW FROM THE CHAMBERS OF JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY. A PERSONAL NOTE TO ME FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I BECAME A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER. AND JUSTICE KENNEDY REFLECTING UPON THE FORMATION OF GOVERNMENT ADDED SITTING CALIFORNIA. WROTE ARE. SELF GOVERNMENT MUST NOT BE AN ABSTRACT IDEAL. BUT MUST BE A REALITY. AND WE MUST BE UNCEASING. IN OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND RESPECTED BY OUR PEOPLE. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT FOR US SAYS LAWMAKERS. TO CALL UPON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO LOOK AT THE BODY OF REGULATIONS. THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT TO. AND LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE IT'S REGULATIONS WHICH IS INCONSISTENT UPDATING DUPLICATIVE. IS ACTUALLY A GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT THE RESPECT OF OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. AND AS I SAY I THINK IN THIS ERA. CONTINUE WITH WHAT WE CONTEND WITH AROUND THE COUNTRY CUTS IN A SPECIALLY VITAL FUNCTION TO LEAD ON. SO I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE IT'S. AND THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON THIS MISTER COOLEY MISTER COOK. THANK YOU THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MANY MISTER AL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY ONE. OF THE BILL. AS WAS STATED EARLIER DOES NOT HAVE ANY MANDATES TO ROLL BACK REPEAL REGULATIONS IT IT REQUIRES A STATE AGENCY SIMPLY IDENTIFIED OF REGULATIONS THAT ARE. OVERLAPPING DUPLICATIVE OR OUT OF DATE. AND THEN REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO YOU THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THIS ALLOWS US TO DO IS TO UP CUT THROUGH ANY SORT OF BIAS SEIZE THE DOG WHEN THAT WE SEE ON. ON BOTH SIDES TO WHAT REGULATIONS DO AND WILL DO. NO MATTER HOW GOOD OUR PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS IS AND IN CALIFORNIA IT IS QUITE GOOD A. WE DO IT WHEN WE KNOW THE LEAST ABOUT WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE REGULATION GOING TO BE IN SO IT'S INCUMBENT UPON A HEALTHY REGULATORY SYSTEM TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS. AND THEN MOVE IN ACCORDANCE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TRACKING WITH REALITY UP THE BENEFIT OF OF AND HAVING THIS LOOK BACK LOOK BACK MECHANISM. THAT WE CAN SEE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TWENTY ELEVEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CONDUCTED A SIMILAR OF RETROSPECT REVIEW MONTH ITS STATE AGENCIES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO SAVE UP THIRTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN CUTTING UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE. OVERLAPPING REGULATION WE EXPECT CALIFORNIA TO RECEIVE A SIMILAR SCALE BENEFIT. UP THIS IS IS WHY THIS MEASURES RECOMMENDED. BY GOOD GOVERNMENT EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES IS RECOMMENDED BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION TWENTY ELEVEN WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND WE. WERE LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE OUR ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE SEEN SOME OF. WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE? THIS IS. A BIT THE METHODOLOGY IN THE BILL IS NOT PRESCRIPTIVE ON HOW AGENCIES NEED TO REVIEW THE REGULATIONS IT PRESERVES FLEXIBILITY ON HOW TO CONDUCT THESE REVIEWS. WHAT WE SAW IN THIS WAS CONDUCTED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS THAT AGENCIES DEVELOP THEIR OWN PLANTS A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW SO HERE? THIS COULD BE ROLLED INTO ORDINARY AGENCY OPERATIONS I COULD BE DONE THROUGH PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT COULD BE CONTRACTED TO A THIRD PARTY OR AGENCIES COULD CHOOSE TO DO IT THEMSELVES AND SO THEIR WAY TO DO THIS THAT ARE NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME WILL NOT COST AGENCIES LIKE MONEY. OR AND WILL NOT PROHIBIT AGENCIES FROM CONDUCTING THEIR ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AGAIN WE SAW THIS HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL YOU BOMB ADMINISTRATION OVER FIVE YEARS WAS STILL ABLE TO ENACT VERY ROBUST PROTECTIONS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WORKERS AND OTHERS. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU MUCH EMAIL SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. REC TIME OF HAVE A CALIFORNIA MS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION I LIKE THAT THE AUTHOR'S AND AGREEING WITH WHAT MISTER COOK SAID WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYBODY'S BEGIN OPPOSITION TODAY. BUT A CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE FOR SIMILAR REASONS THAT WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE FARM BILL SO I WON'T. REITERATE ISSUES THAT THAT ARE ALREADY PRESENT IT BUT I WILL. FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THE. YIELDS ARE DOING THIS WORK OUT WOULD AGREE WITH THE AUTHORS THAT. IT'S A REASONABLE. THEORY IS A REASONABLE NOTION THAT STATE AGENCIES SHOULD. REVIEW REGULATIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE CONSISTENT NOT DUPLICATIVE AND THAT'S WHY THEY ALREADY DO IT THAT'S WHY BEFORE REGULATION GOES INTO PLACE THE IF THE AGENCY REVIEWS REGULATION MIXERS CONSISTENT CURRENT LAW. AND THEY WORK WITH ONLY ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REGULATION AGAIN IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE APA TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT CURRENT LAW NOT DUPLICATIVE NOW OVER BURDENSOME. AND FURTHER WINDOWS REGULATIONS ARE WHEN WE FIVE REGULATION A STEP THROUGH CRACKS AND WE BY REGULATIONS AYE AS YOU GUYS MENTION SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO CONSTITUENTS THAT THIS PARTICULAR A PARTICULAR REGULATION IS INCONSISTENT CAR OFF. THEIR ALREADY MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO REPEAL THOSE REGULATIONS YOU CAN ASK AGENCY YOU CAN AT YOU CAN GO THROUGH THE OLEO YOU CAN WORK THROUGH THOSE EXISTING PART YOU CAN GO TO WORK THROUGH THOSE EXISTING MECHANISMS TO. REPEAL REGULATIONS WITH THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT BY EVERY STATE AGENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TO RE REVIEW. EVERY REGULATION THAT THEY'VE EVER PASSED. THAT'S WORK THAT THE ALLELES ARE DONE THAT'S WHAT THE AGENCY ARE DESIGNED AND IS TAKING A RESOURCES FROM THOSE AGENCIES FROM DOING THEIR CORE MISSION AND I WILL ALSO LEADS THE READER WORK JUST STATE THAT. IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE THE REGULATION OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT'S FALL INTO CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES TO ENFORCE CALIFORNIA PRIORITIES ARE VALUES SO WHEN YOU SEE SORT OF THE DISMANTLING OF THE EPA ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR YOU SEE THE CHANGES ONE. OF THE LABOR AGENCY ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR YOU SEE THEIR THOUGHTS THAT FACTOR IMMIGRANTS A FALSE TO CALIFORNIANS ARE CONSTITUENTS RELY ONE CALIFORNIA'S THE AGENCIES TO DO THAT WORK SO WHEN YOU HAD THE SORT OF. UNNECESSARY NEW BURDENS YOU PUT ALL AGENCIES WITHOUT BY THEM NEW RESOURCES WHEN THERE'S ALREADY A STATE AGENCY WAS RD DOING GIVE YOU'RE REALLY DOING A DISSERVICE TO THOSE AGENCIES JOE HAD LABOR AGENCY. FOCUSING ALWAYS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE EPA FOCUSING ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION YOU HAD THEM DOING THE WORK OF THE OLEO AGAIN BUT WHEN THE RT HAD THE AUTHORITY IN THE RESOURCE DO THE WORK THIS BILL IS ASKING THEM TO DO SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POST. YEAH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARKETS BEGINNING WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION AND. UNDERSTAND THAT A NUMBER OF THE POINTS TODAY HAVE BEEN. DEBATED A STATED ON THE PHONE BILLS WELL SO WILL NECESSARILY BELABOR THE POINT SO TO SAY THAT I'M WE TO ALSO RESPECT THE OFFICE GOALS IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT ON THERE IS SOME REVIEW. OF REGULATIONS AND. DUPLICATION AND THINGS THAT ARE SORT OF OUR PRESENT ON IN OUR STATE'S REGULATIONS BUT ON WE FEEL THAT EXISTING LAW ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE. OF THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS A PROCESS TO REVIEW REGULATIONS ENSURING THAT THEY MEET THE ON REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT. THEY LOOK AT ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING NECESSITY AUTHORITY CLARITY CONSISTENCY REFERENCE AND A LASTLY NON DUPLICATION. AND THE O. L. ALSO AS A POWER SAYS TO CONDUCT PRIORITY REVIEW REGULATIONS THAT FILLS DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. AMON ADDITION TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY ABILITY TO PETITION. AND ALMOST OF OTHER THINGS AND SO AGAIN WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR'S. WE ULTIMATELY FEELS AS THOUGH IT DIVERTS RESOURCES AWAY FROM IMPORTANT DUTIES RELATING TO WORKER AND FAMILY SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE TO OPPOSE. THANK YOU WANT BUT. THE LAST WITNESS BRIEF PLACE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TIM CAMERA BE HAVE SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING THE STATE WORKERS WITH CAN CALIFORNIA. I THINK MY BROTHER ELOQUENTLY SENATE ALREADY SO I WILL JUST SAY THAT WE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. I THINK VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE BEGIN OPPOSITION. MATT BROUGHT HERE ON BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS LONGSHOREMEN UNITE HERE PATH EIGHTY YOU YOU W. A AND I'LL RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THAT YOU. VERY MUCH OKAY. QUESTIONS CONTRA COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE NARROWLY TAILORED THEN WE THE OTHER BILL THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT TODAY AND AND I THINK BEFORE. AS A AS A SOCIAL PROFESSIONAL BEFORE WE EVER TRY TO INTERVENE WITH ANYBODY WE DO A FULL ASSESSMENT FIRST ARE YOU CAN'T TREAT SOMETHING UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH. AND I THINK THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT EVERY AGENCY CAN USE THAT WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN GOING ON GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPILE. SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND AGAIN I SUBMITTED UP. PROPOSAL MISTER COOLEY LAST YEAR YEAR BEFORE LAST ABOUT MAKING THIS COMMITTEE A LITTLE BIT MORE BEEFY ON ITS ABILITY TO DO OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AS WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT LOOKING AT ALL THE RICH BUT REGULATIONS. OKAY ANY OTHER MEMBERS WANT TO SPEAK MISTER MISTER CLEAREST CAO RESPECT TO POSITIONS OF THE OF THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING TO A MEMBER HERE THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY YEAR OF IN THE LEGISLATURE OF A HUNDRED PERCENT VOTING RECORD. WITH WITH LABOR SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT MY INTENTION ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO PUT OUR LABOR. UNIONS IN CALIFORNIA ANY TYPE ABOUT POSITION BY DOING THIS OPERAS AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WHAT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED IS THAT. YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE ANY AGENCY REGULATION THAT GETS DEVELOP BEALL REVIEWED ARE REVIEWED AYE AND POTENTIALLY AUGMENTED BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW DURING A TIME OF TERM LIMITS I'M SURE THERE WERE A LOT OF POLITICAL REASONS WHY CERTAIN BILLS MAY HAVE PASSED. AT AND IF IT'S SOMETHING AS PASSED BY LAW YOU CAN'T JUST ELIMINATED IT IN LAW CODIFIED BY LAW PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND SO. THAT'S NOT JUST EASILY DISPENSED WITH AND SO I I DON'T THINK IT'S A ARE UNFAIR AND AND AND TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN. TO TAKE THE TIME TO REVIEW ALL THE STATE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I. THEY ARE OUT OF DATE DUPLICATIVE NO LONGER WRAPPED REBEL RELEVANT. REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND AGAIN THIS STUDY MAY TURN UP SAYING THAT THERE ARE NONE AND I'M FINE WITH THAT BUT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY WHICH. ARE LEGISLATIVE BODY ESPECIALLY NOW BEING OF TWELVE YEARS HAVE TRIED TO FOCUS MORE TIME AND ATTENTION ON. THAT WE TAKE THE TIME TO TAKE THAT THAT THAT REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR JOBS PART OF OUR DUTY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WOULD DEFERRED ANY OTHER COME TO MY. JOINT AUTHORED. WELL I THINK THE OUT DATED COMPONENTS MOST IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE WORLD CHANGES. ON A DAILY WEEKLY MONTHLY YEARLY BASIS. AS FOR REGULATION DRAFTED A POINT IN TIME WHICH MAKES SENSE. DON'T KEEP UP WITH CHANGES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AND SO THIS ELEMENT OF LOOKING FOR ANY ASPECT OF OUTDATED NESS. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE APA SYSTEM IS REALLY SET UP A FUND INTO TO CONFRONT. THERE DOOR TRYING TO ADOPT TIMELY REGULATIONS. BUT CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH REVOLUTIONS. IN THE WAY BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED. AS WE ALL WELL KNOW SO I THINK THAT'S A. THE. OPPOSITION IS NOT RESPONSIVE THE OUTDATED ASPECT AND AGAIN I THINK AS A ELECTED OFFICIALS IT IS. OUR. OUR CHALLENGE IN OUR AREA. TO ESTABLISH A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY WORKS AND SHOULD BE RESPECTED. AND THAT MEANS WE NEED TO BE OPEN TO. TO. EXAMINE OUR CITY GOVERNMENT WORKS I THINK THIS ALLIANCE WITH THE ANGELS ON ARE SWORN OBLIGATION THE CONSTITUTION. WITH THE ANGELS.
