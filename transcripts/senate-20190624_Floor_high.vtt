ANYMORE.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:51.023
AND THEY REBELLED -- AND THAT --

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.459
UPRISING WAS A PRECURSOR TO

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.861
STONE WALL.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.163
I RECOUNT THIS HISTORY OF OUR

00:09:57.229 --> 00:10:01.133

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:03.836
STRUGGLE AND THERE ARE STILL SO

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:06.539
MANY AREAS IN THE WORLD AND EVEN

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:07.373
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.277
WERE LGBTQ PEOPLE CANNOT LIVE

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:13.079
THEIR AUTHENTIC LIVES.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.614

BEEN MURDERED [inaudible] FOR

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:29.962

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.432

BEFORE US TODAY HI IT SEEMS SO

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.340
SIMPLE NOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:42.775

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:53.819
CONTROVERSIAL -- WHEN EVERY

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.654

FLOOR WHEN THAT BILL WAS

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.492

WHEN HE CAME HOME HE GOES.

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:04.336

OF COURSE IT FIFTH GRADE I

00:25:16.147 --> 00:25:17.082
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:17.382
[inaudible]

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:20.051
WELL.

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:21.786
MY FATHER AND HIS FAMILY.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:22.387
WOULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.322
WITH HER.

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:25.790
BECAUSE SHE WAS.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:29.561
OUT AS ONE CAN BE IN THOSE DAYS.

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:31.897
AND I NEVER MET HER.

00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:33.431
I THEN STUMBLED UPON HER

00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:35.267
OBITUARY.

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:36.868
IN THE SEVENTIES AND IT

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:38.637
INDICATED THAT SHE DIED WITH NO

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:39.237
LIVING RELATIVES.

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:41.339
I'M ALIVE.

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:43.308
MY FATHER WAS ALIVE.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.278
SO FROM THAT POINT ON I WAS

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:47.846
CLEAR.

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.481
THAT THIS IS WRONG.

00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:50.982
AND THAT I WAS DENIED EVER

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.018
GETTING TO MEET.

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:54.519
MY GREAT AUNT.

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:56.855

00:25:58.456 --> 00:25:59.891
WORLD?

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:02.994
SO THEN AS I GREW AND MY OWN

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.696
DAUGHTER [inaudible]

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.331
IS GAY.

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.732
CAME OUT VERY EARLY.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:10.168
AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.803
AND WE LIVED IN IT WHAT I

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.004
THOUGHT WAS A VERY TOLERANT

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.507
COMMUNITY -- MANY OF OUR FRIENDS

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:17.642
WERE GAYS AND LESBIANS WHO ALSO

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:18.843
HAD CHILDREN WHICH THAT MY

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.879
DAUGHTER GREW UP WITH.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.681
AND YET MY DAUGHTER SUFFERED A

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:24.516
SERIOUS DEPRESSION IN HIGH

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:25.183
SCHOOL.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.918

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:29.521
GAY WHO WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE

00:26:29.587 --> 00:26:30.622
AND GREW UP WITH HER SEEM

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:33.625
PERFECTLY HEALTHY WELL ADJUSTED

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:34.626
KIDS.

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:36.561
THEN BECAME CUTTERS.

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:37.595
AND TOOK OTHER VERY SUS SELF

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:39.831
DESTRUCTIVE ACTIVITY AND I WOULD.

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.232
AND THEY WOULDN'T TALK TO THEIR

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:42.334
PARENTS.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.903
AND THEY WOULD BE OVER AND AT

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.738
OUR HOUSE AND I WOULD TALK TO

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.306
WHAT'S GOING ON IN.

00:26:48.373 --> 00:26:50.375
AND THEY WOULD BASICALLY START

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:51.576
TO CAN TALK ABOUT.

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:54.012
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T I CAN'T WALK

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.848
AROUND AND HOLD MY HAND OF THE

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.483
PERSON THAT THEY HAD TO CRUSH ON

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.518

THERE THEY CAN EXPRESS THEIR

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.858
AFFECTION FOR EVERYBODY THEY

00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.827
HAVE A CRUSH ON AND WE CAN'T AND

00:27:08.893 --> 00:27:11.596
WERE AFRAID TO SAY WHO WE AR.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.832
AND I WAS SO BLOWN AWAY THAT

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:15.834
EVEN IN A COMMUNITY LIKE
