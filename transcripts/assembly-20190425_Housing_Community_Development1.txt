THE THURSDAY APRIL TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEETING. OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. ONE APPRECIATE EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT THIS MORNING WE HAVE ONE ITEM TODAY AND THAT IS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO OF WHICH I AM THE AUTHOR. I WANT TO JUST AS A HOUSEKEEPING MENTION A FEW THINGS. AB THIRTY SIX WAS POLL TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR AND IT HAS BEEN SENT BACK TO THE RULES COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF GROUND RULES FOR THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT HAVE TYPICALLY NOT COME TO THIS COMMITTEE ROOM. OF FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARDS TO TODAY -- IT I AM GOING TO SHORTLY TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER DIP. AND I WILL BE MAKING A PRESENTATION ON THIS BILL ALONG WITH OUR WITNESSES. EACH SIDE TODAY IS GOING TO HAVE THREE WITNESSES AND A TOTAL OF TEN MINUTES EACH. FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS THAT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY AN INITIAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSION OF THAT IS WHAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO DO. AND THEN WE WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT PUBLIC COMMENTS AND START WITH THE FOLLOWING. THIS IS DEMOCRACY. WHAT WE EXPECTED DEMOCRACIES FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR PERSPECTIVE? BUT WE ALSO EXPECT IN OUR DEMOCRACY IS WE EXPECT RESPECT. WE EXPECT STABILITY. AND WE EXPECT PEOPLE NOT TO INTERRUPT EACH OTHER. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY AND THIS IS HOW WE TYPICALLY DO PUBLIC COMMENT WHEN WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT WISH TO EXPRESS OUR PERSPECTIVE. IS WE'RE GONNA ASK EVERYONE IN PUBLIC COMMENT TO LINE UP AT THAT MICROPHONE. WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN BATCHES. GONNASTART WITH INDIVIDUALS HERE IN THIS ROOM AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO STATE. YOUR NAME. ONE AFFILIATION. AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE BILL SO I WILL GIVE THE EXAMPLE. I'M DAVID CHIU. FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO DO IF YOU DO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT WE'RE GONNA CUT YOUR MICROPHONE OFF SO THAT WE GIVE EVERYONE EQUAL TIME. WE YOU CANNOT WAIVE SIGNS BECAUSE THAT INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE. AND AGAIN WE'RE ASKING FOR RESPECT. I KNOW THAT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO SAY MORE THAN WHAT. THAT WHAT I JUST SAID BUT IF WE DON'T DO THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA. BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE HERE AND THAT IS HOW WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THIS HOUSE. SO WITH THAT. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO THE PRESENTATION. AND I'M GONNA TURN -- THE THE THE PODIUM OVER -- TO OUR VICE CHAIR BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT LET US TAKE ROLL MADAM SECRETARY COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TO HEAR TO HEAR DEEP. DEEP HERE GABRIEL. GABRIEL HERE GLORIA GLORIA HERE KILEY. THE MON. LIMÃ³N HERE MAIENSCHEIN. MENTION HERE QUIRK SILVA. EXCELLENT HERE WE WILL NOW TAKE UP FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB. ONE FOUR EIGHTY TWO MISTER -- MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU MAY BEGIN YOU COLLEAGUES. FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST SAY I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU AND YOUR DEEP CONSIDERATION OF THESE ISSUES AND LET ME START WITH THE FOLLOWING. EVERYONE OF US IN THIS ROOM KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS TIME IN HISTORY IT'S ALMOST A CLICHE TO SAY THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS. THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. BUT WE ARE. WE'RE NOT ONLY A HOUSING CRISIS WHEN HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND WHEN ATTENDED CRISIS AND INNOVATION CRISIS. MOST OF CALIFORNIANS SEVENTEEN MILLION TENANTS DO NOT HAVE SAFE SECURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF TENANTS WERE ONE RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. GET HEALTH CARE OR AT THE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. I OFTEN SAY THAT THE WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM REQUIRES THE THREE PIECE THAT WE NEED TO PRODUCE A LOT MORE HOUSING. PRESERVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE AND PROTECT VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS FROM LOSING THEIR HOUSING. THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY WE SHOULD ONLY FOCUS ON PRODUCTION. BUT I WOULD SAY EVEN IF TODAY WE COULD ENTITLED ALL OF THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS OF HOUSING THAT WE ARE SHORT ON IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL TAKE YEARS IF NOT DECADES TO BUILD. AND IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED PROTECTIONS NOW FOR CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL OUR BILL. IS A BILL TO ADDRESS RENT GOUGING. OUR ANTI REGARDING BILL IS A CRITICAL PROTECTION THAT WILL HELP RENTERS WHILE STILL ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO MAKE A HEALTHY RETURN. IT IS NOT RENT CONTROL. IT IS MEANT TO PROTECT TENANTS AGAINST THE MOST EGREGIOUS RENT INCREASES NO MATTER WHERE THEY RENTS ARE WHAT KIND OF UNIT THEY LIVE IN. OUR BILL IS BASED ON A LAW THAT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES FOR NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. AN ANTI PRICE GOUGING LAW. THAT PREVENTS INCREASES IN RENT OR OTHER PRICES OR GOODS BY MORE THAN 10%. AFTER AN EMERGENCY A DAD'S ASTOR OR A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. GIVEN THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING EVERYDAY IT'S CLEAR THAT WE ARE IN A HOUSING EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. MORE TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT WHO THIS BILL [inaudible] WOULD HELP. OF CALIFORNIA SEVENTEEN MILLION RENTERS. WE HAVE TWO MILLION WHO ARE PROTECTED BY RENT CONTROL. BUT FIFTEEN MILLION WHO ARE NOT. THIS IS A BILL THAT FOCUSED ON THOSE FIFTEEN MILLION. WE ALL KNOW THAT RENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING MUCH FASTER THAN INCOMES IN THE PAST TEN YEARS ALONE THE MEDIAN RENTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAS INCREASED BY OVER A THIRD WHILE THE MEDIAN INCOME HAS REMAINED FLAT. AND IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASED FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. AS A RESULT OVER HALF OF RENTERS OVER 80% OF LOW INCOME RENTERS ARE RENT BIRD. WHICH MEANS A PAY OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD RENTS. ACCORDING TO RECENT MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE STUDY. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR HOUSING THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO AFFORD. THIS MEANS CHOICES THAT NO FAMILY SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE WHETHER TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS OR KEEP THEIR FAMILIES FED HEALTHY AND EDUCATED. NOW LET ME SAY THIS. THIS BILL IS NOT A SILVER BULLET FOR ALL OF THESE CONCERNS BUT WE DO THINK THAT WILL GO A SIGNIFICANT WAY TOWARD PROTECTING. THOSE FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL. EIGHTY FOUR EIGHTY TWO ESTABLISHES A MAXIMUM RENT INCREASE IN RENTS. THAT IS SET OUT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX PLUS 5%. GIVEN THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCREASE IN CPI IS BEEN BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF 23%. IT FLUCTUATES WITH THE ECONOMY SO IN HARD TIMES THIS CAP COULD BE AT 5% IN A HOT ECONOMY LIKE THE ONE WE HAVE TODAY POTENTIALLY 10%. AND IN KEEPING WITH THE PRICE GOUGING LAW THAT I MENTION BEFORE WE ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM INCREASE IN ANY YEAR OF 10%. WHAT THIS CAP DOES IS PREVENT THE MOST EGREGIOUS INCREASES IN RENTS? A 15% 25% 50% A 100% 2100% THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT ALL TOO COMMONLY. IT PROVIDES A SENSE OF CERTAINTY AND STABILITY SO FAMILIES WOULD NOT NEED TO LIVE IN THE FEAR OF A GIANT UNKNOWN INCREASE OF RENT RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. THAT COULD FORCE THEM OUT OF THEIR HOME. FOR LANDLORDS THIS BILL WOULD STILL ENABLE THEM NOT JUST A FAIR RATE OF RETURN BUT A HEALTHY RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL WE INTRODUCED IT AT CPI PLUS BLANK WE DID NOT PUT A NUMBER IN? I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER WAS. LET ME SAY THAT CPI PLUS FIVE CAME FROM THREE SOURCES. FIRST THE IDEA FOR THIS BILL AND THE CONCEPT OF CPI PLUS FIVE CAME FROM A PAPER. BY THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION CALLED FINDING COMMON GROUND AND RENT CONTROL. SECOND ALMOST IN ALL AFTER ALMOST A TWO YEAR NEGOTIATION OF THE BAY AREA BETWEEN TYPICALLY WARREN STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING RENTS HOUSING INDUSTRY PLAYERS. TENANTS AND PROGRESSIVE EQUITY ADVOCATES LABOR PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE BAY AREA CASA COMPACT ALSO PROPOSED CPI PLUS FIVE AS SOMETHING THAT WAS AGREED UPON BY THE PARTIES. THIRD I'VE ASKED BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE FOR DATA TO JUSTIFY NUMBER. I WAS PROVIDED DATA FROM HOUSING NOW. DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS THAT SHOWS THAT CPI PLUS 5% IS ON AVERAGE. A 100% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE MEDIAN RENTS INCREASE FOR EACH OF THE STATE'S LARGEST REGIONS. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AN ANNUAL RENT INCREAE OF CPI PLUS INCREASED RENT. FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN THE ACTUAL. REGIONAL MEDIAN RENT INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR THIS CONVERSATION I WANT TO THANK BOTH SIDES. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION. BUT AT THE END THE DAY MY PROFOUND HOPE IS THAT WE PROVIDE THE CERTAINTY THE CALIFORNIA RENTERS NEED. SO THAT THEY WON'T RECEIVE AN EXORBITANT RENT INCREASE WELL WE ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. STARTING FIRST WITH ELSA STEVENS WHO IS A TENANTS FOLLOWED BY CENTER D. AS FROM SEIU AND SAY SER DS FROM THE BUILDING TRADES. THEY COULD LIKE GERMAN UP BUT BE. BEFORE YOU WITNESS -- AGAIN -- IT'S ONE OF MY EVERYONE AGAIN THAT COLLECTIVELY OF THE THREE OF YOU HAVE A TEN MINUTES OR SO WE HAVE ABOUT. A THREE MINUTES THAT ALLOCATED FOR EACH ONE OF YOU AND THE CLERK WHEN I WAS. A TECH WORLD YOU MAY BEGIN MA'AM. I'M CONFUSED DO I HAVE THREE MINUTES OR TEN MINUTES YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. I'M ALSO STEVENS MY HUSBAND AND I LIVE IN A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IN A ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO UNIT COMPLEX CALLED HERITAGE PARK AT HILLTOP IN RICHMOND. NEITHER OF US ARE TRUST FUND BABIES WE WORKED ALL OUR LIVES AND PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY. MY HUSBAND WAS A COMPUTER SYSTEM SALESMAN FOR MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE UNTIL HE HAD A QUADRUPLE BYPASS. WHEN WE RETIRED SIX YEARS AGO IT WAS PRIORITY FOR US TO LIVE IN YOUR THIRTY ONE YEAR OLD AUTISTIC SON WHO IS CURRENTLY LEARNING TO TIE HIS SHOE LACES? WE MOVED TO HERITAGE PARK ADVERTISED AS QUOTE UNQUOTE QUALITY AFFORDABLE APARTMENT COMMUNITY FOR SENIOR LIVING. TO LIVE HERE YOU MUST BE OVER FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND CANNOT HAVE INCOME ABOVE A MODERATE LEVEL. WE THOUGHT OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AND FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS. THE RENT. ONLY WENT UP A LITTLE BIT EACH YEAR THEN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ARE IT WENT UP 7% PER MONTH MOST OF US ARE SENIORS ON FIXED INCOMES AND HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OUR MISTAKES. ON LUXURIES. LIKE CAR REPAIRS AND MEDICINE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE NEXT YEAR USA PROPERTIES DECIDED TO RAISE OUR RENT 12% THEY AWOKE A ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO UNIT. COMMUNITY GIANT. SENIORS ARE LUCKY TO GET A ONE OR 2% RAISE FOR IT FROM SOCIAL SECURITY MOST OF US HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD. WALMART IS NO LONGER HIRING READERS. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE OR ALREADY SPENDING 40% OF OUR INCOME ON RENT MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS SEVENTY OR EIGHTY A FRIEND OF MINE IN THE BUILDING MRS OVERTON IN HER EIGHTIES HAS ONLY HUNG ON BECAUSE HER CHILDREN NOW COVER HALF THE RENT. THE FOOD BANK COMES TO OUR COMMUNITY. A 19% RENT INCREASE IN TWO YEARS WOULD MAKE MOST OF US INSTANTLY HOMELESS ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S. THAT IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION THAT IS A FACT. HERITAGE PARK AT HILLTOP WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE PER COSTA HAWKINS. RICHMOND COULD NOT COVER US UNDER ITS RENT CONTROL LAWS BUT BECAUSE WE ALL PEOPLE ORGANIZE AND REYES SUCH A STINK. USA PROPERTIES LORD OUR RENT HIKE FROM 12% 23% BUT EVEN THEN WE LOST FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS THEY HAD TO MOVE. NOW WE'RE HEARING THAT USA PROPERTY THINKS 5% OF THIS YEAR IS A KINDNESS. 7% IN 1720173% IN NOW EQUALS 15% NOBODY'S SOCIAL SECURITY INCREASES 15% IN THE IN THREE YEARS. THIRTY SECOND MA'AM. THIRTY SECONDS OKAY -- YOU GOT TO MOVE THESE BILLS WE ALL -- NOT NOT ONE WILL SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. WE NEED ALL. THREE WE SENIORS CAN'T OUT SPEND THE CORPORATE LANDLORD LOBBY THERE'S FLOODING THIS CAPITAL WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEARS NOT JUST IN LOBBYING BUT IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW SOMETHING WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE UP GIVE IN OR AND OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE WANT RENT CONTROL THANK YOU IT'S TIME FOR OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO DECIDE WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON THANK YOU WITH EVEN. OF WITHIN A RADIUS. HI GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS SEND IDEAS ON VICE PRESIDENT WITH SEIU UNITED SERVICE WORKERS WEST WE REPRESENT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CONTRACTED OUT WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE ALSO ON TO LECTURE ON THE LIFE SCA YOU CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND WE'VE ALSO MADE THE ENTIRE KEEP. ON FAMILIES HOMES LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES. AND FOR MANY OF YOU YOU KNOW SOME FOLKS WILL SAY WELL WHY IS LABOR IN HERE -- IN SUCH BIG NUMBERS REPRESENT TEAM -- TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND IT'S NO LONGER ENOUGH TO SUPPORT AS AN IN SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES JUST WITH OUR CONTRACT CAMPAIGNS -- ORGANIZING EFFORTS WERE HEARING DAY IN AND DAY OUT FROM OUR MEMBERS THAT THERE WE SURVEYED OUR MEMBERS THE OUR HOME AND SECURE THEIR WAITING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. TO SEE IF THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND THAT IS A REALITY THAT OUR MEMBERS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE. ON CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THIS IS A THIS IS A I HAVE MOMENT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE BEING TESTED COULD WE LEADING COULD WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS LIVE HERE COULD WE HAVE. SECURITY OFFICERS WHO ARE MOSTLY BLACK MEN WHO ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST NUMBERS OF FOLKS THAT ARE. HOMELESS OR ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES APART IMMIGRANT WORKERS HERE. I KNOW THAT WE'VE DONE. A WHOLE LOT OF PEACE PEACE IS TO MOVE OUR COMMUNITIES FORWARD BUT WHEN WE HEAR FROM OUR MEMBERS FROM HOME CARE WORKERS THIS MORNING WHO ARE ELDERLY ST WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO KEEP UP WITH THE RED ZONE A HEARING FROM OUR SECURITY OFFICERS ONE IS SILICON. VALLEY THAT WAS SPOKEN NATIONAL CONFERENCES CLEANING HI TECH MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES -- AND BEING A SECURITY OFFICER THAT LIVING IN THEIR CARS. WORKING FULL TIME. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A SPACE TO LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS UNACCEPTABLE SO YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE ME HERE REPRESENTATION OF OUR FORTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS AND ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF SCA YOU CALIFORNIA. AT THE TIME. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. IS NOW WE CAN NO LONGER WAY OUR MEMBERS CAN A LONGER WAIT ARE GOING TO BE HOLDEN EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE TO HAVE A TOUGH CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARMING CALIFORNIANS THAT LOOK LIKE SECURITIES LIKE JANITORS LIKE HOME CARE WORKERS ARE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE A SPACE. AND CALL CONTINUE TO CALL THIS OUR HOME AND THAT HOPEFULLY THE HOME IS NOT OUR CARS HOPEFULLY THE HOME IS NOT I'D IV OUTSIDE OF OF A PARKING LOT WHERE I HAVE NEWS WHERE I HAVE TO TAKE. AND BORROW ELECTRICITY IN STATE MAY AND C. HOMINID WAKE UP TOMORROW SO I SEE THAT AND I'M HERE. PROUD OF THE WORK THAT I'M SITTING MEMBER CHIU HAS DONE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN WITH THE CONVERSATION FOR IT. THANK YOU. YES. MISTER NIAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SRT HAS OVER HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. OF VERY PROUD TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF OF A KEY PIECE OF THE HOUSING PACKAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS DEBATING. YESTERDAY WE WERE LOOKING AT PRODUCTION BILL SB FIFTY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT BUT THAT COULD NOT BE ARE ALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE. A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS BOB WHEN THEY GET A RAISE IT'S NOT GOING TO THEIR POCKET IS NOT GOING TO DISTRIBUTE THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY. IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE RENT AND THE HIGH COST OF OF HOUSING IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. YES THEY ARE STEADILY WORKING -- BUT WITH WITH THE COST OF HEALTH CARE RISE IN THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION THE COST OF LIVING IN GENERAL. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO SOMEONE ELSE AND NOT TO THEMSELVES. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT FROM OUR MEMBERS NOT ONLY -- IN TERMS OF THE WORK AND AND AND IT'S NATURAL FOR THEM TO WORK AND AND AND TRAVEL ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES TO GET TO A CONSTRUCTION SITE. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO MOVE FROM THE URBAN CENTERS WHERE A LOT OF THAT GROWTH IS TAKING PLACE INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE I CAN AFFORD. THAT EXTENDS THEIR COMMUTE TIME SO MUCH MORE AND THAT IMPACTS OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TIMES WITH THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT WE SEE HERE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BETWEEN INCOME AND RENTAL PRICES WELL AT THE SAME TIME SCALING UP THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WORKING CLASS? AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WILL ACHIEVE THIS BY CAPPING ANNUAL RATE INCREASE AT A SUFFICIENT LEVEL ABOVE THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THE BILL SEEKS TO BALANCE THE NEEDS OF RENTERS WITH THOSE A PROPERTY OWNERS ENABLING A FAIR RETURN SIMILAR TO OTHER BUSINESS INVESTMENTS AND EXEMPTING UNITS SUBJECT TO EXISTING RENT TO RENT CONTROL PROTECTIONS. DEED RESTRICTED IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE BELIEVE THE FAR TOO MANY WORKERS ARE BEING FORCED OUT OF TO WORK TWO OR THREE JOBS AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND SUFFERING LONGER COMMUTES IN ORDER TO ADD A FORTY EXCESSIVE INCREASES. AND RENTAL PAYMENT IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING HOMELESS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGENTLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS THE D. IS -- I NOW LEYVA WHEN ASKED IF THERE'S ANY -- ANY MEMBER FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY BUSINESS CARLTON YES GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR LABORING OVER THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION I KNOW WE'RE pALL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS. TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS YOU KNOW IN OUR CONCERNS OF ALWAYS BEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE. A BAD SITUATION WORSE. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SCARE OFF DEVELOPMENT AND I KNOW AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED IT TAKES YEARS TO BUILD HOUSING AND THAT'S SHAMEFUL IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ONE DEVELOPER THAT IS NOW TAKING HIM THIRTEEN YEARS. TO GET TO THE TIME IN WHICH SHE WILL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO START CONSTRUCTION. NO PROVIDING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF HOUSING WE ARGUE IS TRULY THE ANSWER. DESPITE THE FACT IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG BUT IT IS THE WAY TO PROTECT TENANTS BOTH EXISTING TENANTS AND FUTURE TENANTS. NOW WITH THAT SAID. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR TENANTS WOULD VIOLATE. THE STANDARDS SET OUT. IN THIS LEGISLATION. HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS NOT AS MUCH ABOUT. THIS CURRENT. BILL BUT THE FUTURE TEMPTATION AND DEMANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL FACE TO LOWER THE STANDARD. MOST RENT CONTROL CITIES STARTED OUT WITH THE STANDARD SIMILAR TO THIS. BUT TODAY WE HAVE 60% OF CPI IN SAN FRANCISCO 65% OF CP I AM BERKELEY AND 75% OF CP I IN SANTA MONICA. AS HOUSING COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A A HUGE CONCERN. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES WENT UP WITH RECYCLING OWNERS ARE FACING A 3100% INCREASE IN IN RECYCLING COSTS. THEY CAN'T RECAPTURE THAT OF COURSE. OWNERS DON'T OR OWNERS AND TENANTS TO TENNIS DON'T MOVE UNDER THOSE SITUATIONS. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO LET CITIES AND COUNTIES OFF THE HOOK. LACING BLAME OF COURSE ON THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY IS AN EASY ANSWER. BUT PROVIDING PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IS THE REAL SOLUTION. WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LINK. IN FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO HOUSING PRODUCTION. AND OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW ORGAN RECENTLY IMPOSED A STATEWIDE RENT CAP AT 7% PLUS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. FOR CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE A LOWER CAP CERTAINLY IS QUESTIONABLE OF COURSE OUR COST OF LIVING HERE. LAND PRICES CONSTRUCTION AND FEES ARE MUCH HIGHER. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TWENTY FIVE SECONDS FIRST IN THE UNITED STATES ORGANISED TWENTY FIFTH. WE NEED A REAL SOLUTION AND WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING ALL OF OUR CONCERNS HERE TODAY THANK YOU. WE WE CAN HELLO GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- CREAM THREE CM HALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED C. R. OPPOSES AB -- FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH PLACES A STATEWIDE CAP ON THE AMOUNT THE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNER MAY ANNUALLY INCREASE RENT. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IN THIS HEARING -- ORGAN ENACTED SB SIX AWAIT EARLIER THIS YEAR. THAT LAW FEATURES A 7% PLUS CPI CAP AS WELL AS A FIFTEEN YEAR NEW CONSTRUCTION EXEMPTION. BASED ON CONVERSATIONS SEE OURS HAD WITH THE AUTHOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE SPONSORS AND STAFF SEE OUR WILL BE DISCUSSING AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AT ITS UPCOMING BUSINESS MEETINGS NEXT WEEK. DURING THESE MEETINGS SEE OUR WILL EVALUATE THE BILL AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INPUT ON THE MEASURE. SEE OUR LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE AS IT EXPLORES VARIOUS PUBLIC POLICY OPTIONS THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BE BEFORE YOU START -- I THE CHAIRMAN THE THE OPPOSITION HAS A HAS A REQUEST WHERE -- IN IN THEIR COLLECTIVE TEN MINUTES -- THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPLIT IT. INTO AMONG FOUR SPEAKERS INSTEAD OF THREE IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU THAT'S FINE WITH ME OKAY -- WE NEEDS OF THE GERMAN ONLY USE THE TWO MINUTES SO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA MINUTE HERE. A YOU SO WITH. GOOD AND USED USE YOUR THREE MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. WE ALL AGREE CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS THE STATE WIDE FAILURE TO KEEP UP WITH NEW DEMAND FOR HOUSING. EVEN THROUGH RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NOW HISTORIC LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. HAS RESULTED IN A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF AVAIL HOUSING UNITS AND CORRESPONDINGLY. RAPIDLY RISING HOUSING AND RENTAL COSTS. WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE A ROLE IN DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IS A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING. THIS IS NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION THIS IS THE CONCLUSION FROM A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH STUDYING HOUSING MARKET DATA. AS WELL AS THE CONCLUSION YEAR AFTER YEAR FROM CALIFORNIA'S NONPARTISAN FISCAL POLICY ADVISER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO DOES EXACTLY OPPOSITE OF WHAT LA -- RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THE BILL DISINCENTIVE EYES IS DESPERATELY NEEDED NEW HOUSING BY FAILING TO INCLUDE ANY EXEMPTIONS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. RENT CAPS ON NEW CONSTRUCTION SIMPLY DO NOT PENCIL OUT. EVEN IN OREGON'S RECENTLY PASSED RENT CAP LAW IT INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO ALSO CHERRY PICKS FROM THE CASA COMPAQ LEAVING OUT CRUCIAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT BALANCE A RENT CAP WITH THE REALITIES OF RISING COSTS ON LANDLORDS. A PASS THROUGH PROVISION WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE CASA COMPAQ RECOMMENDATION WOULD ALLOW INCREASES IN WATER SEWER WASTE WATER TRASH ELECTRIC. AND GAS AS WELL AS COST OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF UNITS. ON TO THEIR TENANTS. THE CASA COMPAQ ALSO RECOMMENDS A SUNSET PROVISION TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A SET TIME FRAME TO REVISIT THE EFFICACY OF THIS NEW POLICY. WE OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO NOT BECAUSE WE DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENTION OF PROVIDING HOUSING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. WE SHARE THAT GOAL. BUT BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL COMPOUND CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING HOUSING CRISIS BY MAKING THE LONG TERM AND MOST IMPORTANT SOLUTION ACCORDING TO EMPIRICAL DATA BUILDING MORE SUPPLY. EVEN HARDER FOR THAT WE ARE TO KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A THIS BILL YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMEDY ME -- WARNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATE FELL ON EHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE AND THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION.

AGAIN IF THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE WISH TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC COMMENT EITHER IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME IS CLOSE. THIS ITEM IS BACK IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE -- OUR VICE CHAIR AND IT WAS MAKING HIS WAY BACK BUT IN THE MEANTIME I'M GONNA HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO MS QUIRK SILVA -- AND I WILL GO BACK TO THE DÃ­AS. THERE YOU GO. OKAY -- NOW WE HAVE DISPENSED WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS I WILL -- BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR GLORIA. THE FAMOUS BYE SHARE -- AND I'LL TAKE THE AUTHOR CHAIRMAN OF FOR THIS BUILDING -- MY NAME IS TODD GLORIA TENET FROM SAN DIEGO I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL -- SORRY DEPUTATION YOU HERE IS SO OFTEN -- I APPRECIATE THE WORK THIS PUT ON THIS MISTER MISTER WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THIS BILL AS A WORK IN PROGRESS. ABSOLUTELY WHAT. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE SOME AREAS WHERE YOU THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME INFLUENCE OVER SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION A CONSIDERATION MAYBE BUT BASS IN THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY. OR THROUGH THE CONVERSATIONS YOU IN YOUR OFFICES HAD. SO. I TOOK A COUPLE OF NOTES -- DURING THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY AND ONE OF THE THINGS ALL SAY IS -- THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I THINK THAT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HAS PUBLICLY STATED SOME OF THE POTENTIAL PLACES THEY THE MAN THAT THEY MIGHT GO. SO I HEARD FROM CA -- THE POSSIBILITY OF THINKING ABOUT CPI PLUS SEVEN THE OREGON MODEL -- THINKING ABOUT ASKING FOR A SITUATION -- OR ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF OF NEW CONSTRUCTION I HEARD FROM THE CHAMBER THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF FOR FOLLOWING THE CASA MATA WHICH WAS CPI PLUS. FIVE SOME DESIRE THINK ABOUT TEN IMPROVEMENTS IN PASS THROUGHS OR SUNSETS HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT ALL OF THAT I'M NOT PREPARED TO COMMIT TO ANY OF THESE ISSUES TODAY BUT BUT CERTAINLY. HEARING THEM PUT ON THE TABLE -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I THINK WE WILL CERTAINLY BE HAVING DISCUSSIONS -- IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS -- AS WE AS WE HOPE TO MOVE THIS. FOR I THINK JUST EXPLAINING THAT PARTICULARLY NOTING THIS THE FIRST COMMITTEE -- HEARING FOR THIS BILL -- IS IMPORTANT IS SORT OF INDICATE WE AWARE ARE AREAS OF GIVE IN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- CERTAINLY FOLKS FROM -- THE BUILDING OWNERS ARE PROPERTY MANAGERS FOR BEING AT THE TABLE AND INDICATING THE LEVEL OF OPENNESS THAT FRANKLY IS NEW -- AND THAT SHOULD BE APPRECIATED A KNOWLEDGE -- AND AND THIS MY GRATITUDE FOR THAT I RECOGNIZE THAT OF A SHIFT IN PERHAPS PREVIOUS -- EFFORTS -- INDEED YEAH I THINK EVERY MEMBERS COMMITTEE -- WOULD PROBABLY BE GRATEFUL FOR THE WILL IS TO BE AT THE TABLE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS IDENTIFY THINGS THAT NEED WORK AS OPPOSED REFLECTS OF NO. I THINK IT SIGNALS THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A CRISIS IN THE STATE THE RENT IS TOO HIGH AND WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND WHEN BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE -- ARE SAYING THAT THAT GIVES ME A SENSE AS A DECISION MAKER THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE HERE -- SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A CONTINUE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY PERCENTAGES I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT -- I THINK AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT THE THIS SHOULD NEVER BE ABOUT -- STIFLING PRODUCTION -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE ABOUT A SUPPLY -- THAT WE HAVE NOT BUILT ENOUGH HOMES IN THE STATE FOR DECADES AND DECADES -- AND THAT WE THAT IS THE TRUE SOLUTION IN THE LONG TERM BUT THEY ARE SHORT TERM PAIN THAT SO MANY OF US FEEL -- THAT THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TAKE ACTION UPON AND I NOTE THE COMMENTS OF THE BUILDING TRADES SO I THINK THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT AWAY THEY'RE TALKING. I THINK AS WORKING MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE OF WILL BUILD A LOT OF STUFF I KNOW THIS PROBABLY FEW FOLKS BETTER SUITED TO EXPLAIN -- WHY WE NEED PROBABLY A NOT AN EITHER OR BUT A A BOTH A AND APPROACH -- ON I ASSEMBLY SO I PREACH THE THE OF THIS OR NOT STIFLING DEVELOPMENT I THINK THE BILL CURRENTLY IS SILENT. ON HOW THIS MIGHT APPLY TO NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THAT RIGHT IT IS. AND SO THAT I THINK IS NECESSARY I WOULD POINT OUT THAT FROM MY EXPERIENCES AS A HOUSING COMMISSIONER THE PHARMACY COUNCILMEMBER FORMER MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO I GET. THAT -- I UNDERSTAND IT LANDED ON THE TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM THAT AROUND -- I THINK THE THE PERFORMERS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO FINANCE NEW CONSTRUCTION -- DO NOT RELY UPON RENTAL EIGHT YOU OF YOUR ANNUAL RENT INCREASES OF AT THE ARE UNDER THIS BILL YOU CAN BE A MAXIMUM ABOUT 8% MORE OR LESS. I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY NEEDS THAT TO GET FINANCING AND SO I THINK THAT YOUR CURRENT POSITION IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT TODAY. IF WE CAN SEE DATA THAT SUGGESTED DIFFERENT APPROACH -- THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD BE INTERESTED IN -- IN TERMS OF THE REST OF THE BILL -- I CAN CHECK MY SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL WILL -- WILL UPON FURTHER. HI I WOULD JUST I GUESS I'D WRAP UP BY SAYING SO RECOGNIZE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. IS THAT I WOULD WANT TO APPRECIATE AND THANK THE TURNER CENTER FOR I THINK REALLY HELPING. TO START THIS CONVERSATION -- IN THE AFTERMATH OF LAST YEAR'S PROPOSITION -- TEN THAT COULD NOT BE THE END OF THE CONVERSATION AND REALLY PROVIDING -- I THINK A A VERY REASONABLE APPROACH -- THERE WAS A NEW STORY -- IN MY IN SAN DIEGO -- THIS PAST WEEK OF A PROPERTY OWNER. IN I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS DISTRICT -- WITH -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANYONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE TODAY THEY COULD STAND UP OR DEFEND THAT KIND OF INCREASE. AND WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT WE KIND INCREASE WOULD BE ILLEGAL -- IF IT WERE TO BE LAW -- THAT KIND OF GOUGING HAS NO PLACE -- IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO STOP THAT -- I THINK THE INDUSTRY DOES A FINE JOB OF OF OF TRYING TO GET AMONG SOME SORT OF RECOGNIZES OUR OUT LIARS -- BUT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO BUDGET FOR THAT AND I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY -- TO THAT -- IS SO -- I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD TO SAID SUPPORT HERE I GO I THINK THE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION. IS A STATE WIDE NATURE OF IT -- I RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVEN IF COSTA HAWKINS WERE REFORM TO REPEALED NOT EVERY COMMUNITY WOULD ADOPT IT -- INTO THAT WOULD LEAVE US MAYBE PROBABLY A GOOD NUMBER CITIES I REPRESENT -- UNPROTECTED FOR THEIR TENANTS -- THIS BILL TAKES A DIFFERENT MORE UNIVERSAL APPROACH -- THAT I THINK IS -- BENEFICIAL WHEN WE KNOWLEDGE IS A STATE WIDE CRISIS AND SO THAT'S AN INHERENT VALUE IN THIS BILL -- SO THERE'S A LOT TO SUPPORT HERE TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION -- TO ADVANCE THIS BILL WITH YOUR ASSURANCES THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS -- AND THAT STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES ARE WILLING TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING -- AS A TENANT I UNDERSTAND THIS -- BUT I'M A TENANT WHO HAS A PRETTY DECENT SALARY -- AND SO I RECOGNIZE THAT I EVEN IF I MAY NOT BE A PROPERTY AND I STILL SIT HERE TO PRIVILEGED POSITION -- BUT I DO WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO EVERY TIME THEY GO TO THE DOOR THEIR APARTMENT AND THEY SEE A NOTICE FROM THEIR PROPERTY. MANAGER ON THE DOOR -- THEIR HEART SINKS A LITTLE BIT -- THEY GET VERY VERY NERVOUS IN IF YOU'RE LIKE ME MOST THE TIME IT'S ABOUT MAINTENANCE IN THE BUILDING. BUT A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME IT'S ABOUT A RENT INCREASE AND YOU JUST HOPE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN AFFORD AGAIN I'M BLESSED AND FORTUNATE TO BE IN A POSITION THAT GENERALLY I CAN -- BUT I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS THIS BILL IS A RESPONSE TO THAT. AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL PROMISE HERE THAT IS WORTHY OF CONTINUE DIALOGUE I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME STAND SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU WAS A GLORIA ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM -- MIST -- QUIRK SILVA. AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THIS WEEK IN THE BUILDING AS WE SAY THE CAPITAL THERE IS BEEN MANY -- VITAL DISCUSSIONS UNDER MANY ISSUES WHETHER IT'S HOUSING WHETHER IT'S VACCINATIONS. MANY ISSUES THAT WE BRING -- THIS HOUSE -- O INVITE PEOPLE TO SAY WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU AND THOSE ISSUES ARE. HOTLY DISCUSSED. OR EVEN MORE THAN THAT CONTESTED AND I THINK THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THE SAME IN THE SENSE THAT WE COULD CLEARLY SEE BY THOSE WHO WHO CAME TO THE CAPITOL. WE HAVE MANY THAT OPPOSE AND MANY THAT SUPPORT. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. HI TO SEE THE NEED. FOR LOOKING AT RENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND LOOKING TEN ADDRESS AN ISSUE AND NO MATTER WHERE WE END UP WITH THIS BILL WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE A A SPLIT. OF OPINION ABOUT DID WE DO THE RIGHT THING BUT THIS BILL AGAIN LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID ATTEMPTS TO MAKE A STEP INTO THIS DISCUSSION IT'D TEMPS. TO LOOK AT DATA AS YOU BROUGHT FORWARD TO SAY. CAN THERE BE COMMON GROUND AND I TO DO SUPPORT THIS BILL -- BUT WOULD SERIOUSLY. AND HAVE SERIOUSLY MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR AS THE THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO THE FLOOR THAT. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPECIFY THOSE WHICH IS CONTINUE TO WORK ON STABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF STABILITY NOT ONLY FOR OUR THE RENTERS BUT FOR THE ROAD THE OWNER SAID THAT THIS CANNOT BE CHANGED EVERY. YEAR TWO YEARS SECOND ONLY ADDRESSING THE NEW CONSTRUCTION AS YOU. NOTED WE NO WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND BUILDING UNITS AND BUILDING HOMES AS PART OF THE REASON SO MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS THAT. AND PERHAPS REALLY LOOKING AT LOOKING AT THE BALLOT GOING TOWARDS A POINT WHERE WE KNOW WE JUST LEFT THE BALLOT ON A AND E'S MY DISTRICT IT WAS A VERY SPLIT -- OPINION -- ACTUALLY MORE OPPOSED TO ON RENT CONTROL THEN -- SUPPORTING IT -- BUT JUST THIS WEEK THINGS CHANGE CONSTANTLY -- WE HAD AND MY OWN -- DISTRICT FULLER TEN AND ANAHEIM -- MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER KNEW WHO CAME IN AND DID ALMOST A 3100% NOW THIS WAS OF COURSE CONTESTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH THE CITY COUNCIL'S FULLER CAN ADD ANAHEIM. AND I KNOW THAT THIS OPERATOR IS NOT ONE OF THE OPERATORS -- THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE HE IS AND IN ESSENCE MOVING TOWARDS THE GALGIANI PART THAT -- BRINGS THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL ALL OF THOSE SO WITH THIS BILL MY HOPE IS THAT THERE CAN BE SOME KIND OF ASSURANCE. THAT AS IT MOVES FORWARD AGAIN. WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE CENTER AND WE MOVE TOWARDS THE CENTER WE OFTEN SEE. NEED EITHER SIDE ARE NOT COMPLETELY HAPPY BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA END UP HAVING TAKEN STEPS TOWARDS THE MIDDLE SO WITH THAT I WOULD TO SECOND THE MOTION -- AND AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT. IF THE BILL COMES TO THE FLOOR WITH OUT ADDITIONAL -- TYPES OF ASSURANCES THAT I WOULD RESERVE MY VOTE AS A NO VOTE IF THERE'S NOT ANY CHANGE ON THE FLOOR BUT TODAY I WILL MOVE IT FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS -- QUIRK SILVA ANNEX I HAVE I COULD ACTUALLY RESPOND TO IF A FEW THESE POINTS SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AND FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND I I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU -- I KNOW. ALL OF YOU'VE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS DISCUSSING THIS AND AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE DONE THAT -- WITH REGARD TO THE TOPIC OF STABILITY I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO BE BACK HERE NEXT YEAR OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW OUR FIERCER NOW I CAN TELL YOU. IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET THIS TO THE FINISH LINE I WILL NOT WANT. TO REVISIT THIS CONVERSATION ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO -- I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHERS TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE SOME LEVEL OF STABILITY BOTH SAID THAT WERE NOT. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE THE MARKETS WITH SOME CERTAINTY OF OF OF EXPECTATIONS -- ON ISSUES OF NEW CONSTRUCTION AND OTHERS -- AS I'VE SID I'M OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AND I WILL PUBLICLY I IS FOR MORE DATA. TO INFORM THE DISCUSSION -- I PUT TO BOTH SIDES REQUEST FOR DATA I HAVE CIRCULATED TO THE PUBLIC A SEVENTEEN PAGE DOCUMENT THAT LAYS OUT. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR CPI PLUS COMMENTS. STE THE DATA FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SHOWS THAT CPI PLUS 5% IS A 100% HIGHER. THAN THE ACTUAL MEDIAN ANNUAL RENT INCREASE IN EACH OF THE STATE'S LARGEST REGION'S CPI PLUS FIVE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED RENT INCREASES FOUR TIMES FASTER. THAN SIMILAR RENT INCREASES IN OUR STATE SO. WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT BUT IF THERE IS DATA THAT SHOWS A JUSTIFICATION FOR A HIGHER NUMBER OR FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THAT. WITH THE COPY OUT THAT IN THE IN A MAJOR SHIFT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT USING THE EXAMPLE. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WHEN COSTA HAWKINS WAS DEBATED THE IDEA WAS TO EXEMPT OUT NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND WHAT THAT STORY IN IN IN THE pTHEY DID IN MOST RENT CONTROL CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. IS IT FROZE THE APPLICATION OF RENT CONTROL -- TOO BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE A CERTAIN DATE AND MIGHT CITIES EXAMPLE. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THAT IS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS NOT RENT CONTROL THIS IS A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. BUT WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN HOW WE GO ABOUT IT BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID IF THEY'RE FACTS AND DATA THAT UNDERPIN THIS. WE VERY MUCH WANT TO GO TO RECEIVE THAT I'VE I'VE ASKED INDUSTRY FOR THAT INFORMATION AND AND HOPE THAT THAT WILL INFORM THE DISCUSSION THAT'S WHAT I WANT. TO TO DRIVE THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASY TO ALLOW. IDEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES OR WHERE WE WANT TO SIDE ONE WITH THE OTHER TO DRIVE IT BUT WE ARE JOB AS DELIBERATE OF POLICYMAKERS IS TO USE FACTS AND DATA. TO GET TO THE RIGHT ANSWER TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE PROTECTS OUR RESIDENTS BUT ALSO PROTECTS. THE ABILITY OF OF THE HOUSING MARKET TO TO FUNCTION WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER MISTER MENTORING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN -- IN THANK YOU -- MISSED YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TODAY AND FOR YOUR WORK -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE VERY HARD WORK ON THIS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- I KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING IT'S LATE IT'S THURSDAY EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET BACK HOME AND TO THEIR DISTRICTS -- SO I WILL BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS AND I WOULD ALIGN MYSELF A VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO. I THOUGHT WAS SPOT ON A HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS WERE GREAT AND AND I WOULD BASICALLY SAY DITTO TO EVERYTHING THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE SAID -- BUT I I WANT -- TO MAKE SOME SLIGHT ADDITIONS AND JUST SAY I TO SUPPORT THIS NOTION OF STABILITY I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT. AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF REASONS ONE IS OP FOR OBVIOUS REASONS JUST AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ON A REAP REVISITING THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- BUT CERTAINLY I THINK PEOPLE ON ON ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS ISSUE ARE ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE DON'T WANT SOME PING PONG UNITS BACK IN OUR UP DOWN UP DOWN. YEAR IN YEAR OUT THERE'S A LACK OF CERTAINTY AND THAT I THINK THAT LACK OF CERTAINTY HURTS EVERYBODY -- I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY YOU KNOW YOU YOU AND YOU YOU HAVE SUFFERED YOU SAY IT A NUMBER OF TIMES -- THAT YOU WANT THIS TO BE DATA DRIVEN YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BRING IT OUT I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO HAVE IT BE. HAVE SOMETHING LEGISLATION BE DONE BY FAX -- I THINK IS IS -- IMPORT I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU -- SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE FOR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE AND PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS. THERE OFTENTIMES ONLY A PAYCHECK AWAY OR A NOTICE LITTLE BACK YOU KNOW PIECE OF PAPER ON THEIR DOOR AWAY FROM FROM LOSING THEIR RENTAL PROPERTY FROM LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO HOUSE THEMSELVES. AND THEIR FAMILY AND I THINK TO YOU KNOW TAKE A IT'S SORT OF BEEN BEATING LIKE A DRUM. BUT IT DOES BEAR REPEATING THAT THAT THERE'S A LACK OF SUPPLY ISSUE BUT ALSO TO BE ADDED TO THAT TOO IS THERE'S A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT GOES WITH SUPPLY OF HOUSING. IS THERE HAS TO BE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THAT HOUSING THERE HAS TO BE ROSE RECIPE WATER THERE HAS TO BE. A QUALITY OF LIFE IF YOU'RE EVEN IF WE WERE TO BUILD ALL THESE UNITS WITHOUT THE FOR EXAMPLE THE ROADS TO SUPPORT THOSE UNITS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION. TO SUPPORT THOSE UNITS THIRTY SECOND TRAFFIC THE QUALITY OF LIFE SO I THINK IT. IT'S MORE WHEN WE NEED TO BE SICK TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN JUST SUPPLY IT'S CLEARLY A SUPPLY -- BUT WITHOUT SUPPLY COMES. A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT THE STATE -- IN THE STATE NEEDS TO BE PREPARED INVEST IN OR YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE PEOPLE THAT MAYBE HAVE A HOUSING UNIT BUT THEY CAN'T GET ANYWHERE. IS A CAN'T THE THE THEY'RE NOT NEAR MASS TRANSIT THEY DON'T HAVE MASS TRANSIT OPTIONS. THEY'RE TRAPPED THERE ROADS ARE STUCK IN GRIDLOCK. WATER IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK TO WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY AS A BODY BE THINKING OF THAT AS WELL SO. I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE AT TODAY LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AS IT. HEADS TO THE FOUR THINGS AMONG. THANK YOU. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A VERY HEFTY CONVERSATION -- AROUND HOUSING ISSUES NOT JUST THIS WEEK BUT I MEAN OVER THE YEARS -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED I ASKED AND REQUESTED TO BE ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO MY DISTRICT BUT TO THE ENTIRE STATE. AND OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HUNDREDS OF BILLS RELATED TO HOUSING. AND APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN OF THOSE PASSED OUT OF THIS HOUSE AT AT THE STATE ASSEMBLY. WE MOVED THEM FORWARD SO. WHAT WE TAKE FROM THAT IS THAT THERE IS NOT ONE SOLUTION TO SOLUTIONS OR THREE SOLUTIONS IT TAKES YEARS OF DISCUSSION TO ADDRESS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY? AND FIFTY EIGHT STATES AND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE -- FIFTY SIX COUNTIES AND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN THE STATE THE HOUSING CONVERSATION IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ONE SINGLE BILL. I APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO HAS REACHED OUT TO OUR OFFICES. WHO HAS TAKEN THE TIME? TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN OVER AFFORDABILITY -- OVER. AT HOUSING OVERALL IN THE STATE. IT IS ALSO CLEAR TO ME THAT AT EVERY COUNTY LOOKS AND ADDRESSES THIS IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE OUR NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT -- EIGHTY IN THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT I THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT RANK DOUCHING MEANT. TO FIRE STRICKEN AND DEBRIS FLOWS STRICKEN COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LOST. TOO MANY HUMAN LIVES. ARE IN I KNOW THAT WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE LAW THAT WAS IN PLACE AROUND EMERGENCY -- RANK COUCHING IT HELPED KEEP PEOPLE -- IN THEIR HOMES BECAUSE WE HAD LOST SO MANY HOMES AND IT ALSO GAVE THOSE THAT HAD LOST HOMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOMETHING -- THAT. WAS GOING TO HELP THEM NOT JUST IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT A IN THE FAR FUTURE AS WELL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE -- THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE WITH THIS BILL I APPRECIATE THAT THEIR HAT WHAT I'VE HEARD AND TAKEN AWAY FROM THE CONVERSATIONS THE AUTHOR -- IS THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AT THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS THAT ARE COUNTIES ARE DIFFERENT -- AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS AND BILLS -- BUT ALSO THAT WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN NOT BRINGING. THIS PARTICULAR -- PERCENTAGE CONVERSATION BACK ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT WE COULD. PERHAPS FIND A WAY TO COMMIT -- TO NOT REVISITING THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS I WANT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO KNOW THAT THE CASE THAT. THE STATE LEGISLATURE CARES AND WE WOULDN'T CARE IF WE WEREN'T REALLY. LOOKING AT THE THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE HAVE AND IF WE WOULDN'T HAVE PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO IT -- I KNOW THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS DÃ­AS. TO EXTENSIVE LINKS UP ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO -- NOT JUST THIS WEEK BUT IN IN THE WEEKS COMING AND WE DON'T WHETHER WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE NOT WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE AND SOMETIMES WE AGREE. BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR EXPERIENCE -- AND THE VOICES OF OUR DISTRICT SHAPE HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES -- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA KNOW THAT WE CARE THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY THAT THESE ARE HARD CONVERSATIONS AND THAT OUR STATE. IS SUCH A BIG STATE AND COMPLICATED IN SO MANY WAYS -- BUT THAT WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK THAT'S EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD AND THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT THIS HOUSE HAS MOVED FORWARD. IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS -- RELATED TO THAT SO -- YOU REFERENCED YEAR ON DISTRICTS AND THE CHALLENGES YOU'VE HAD WITH WILD FIRES AND MUD SLIDES AND IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I MOVE FOR THE BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW -- TO I WOULD DESCRIBE STRICTLY SLIGHTLY STRENGTHENED THE PRICE GOUGING STATUTE THAT I REFERENCE THAT CAN ONLY BE INVOKED IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER OR SOME SORT OF DECLARED EMERGENCY AND AND THAT WAS. WHEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT A MODEL LIKE THIS OF OF OF SOME SORT OF ANTI? GOUGING STATUTE -- MR GLORIA REFERENCE THE FACT THAT IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A STATEWIDE STANDARD ONE THING I WANT JUST POINT OUT ABOUT THIS BILL IS WE AMENDED THE BILL WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE CONCEPT OF A REGIONAL CPI WHICH ARE NUMBERS THAT EXIST. BUT TO ALLOW FOR THE FLEXIBILITY OF HOW. UP MORE REGIONAL ECONOMIES AROUND THE STATE ARE ARE DOING -- TO RELATE TO THE CAP THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THAT REGION AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS. ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE I'LL JUST MENTION. WE HAD CONTEMPLATED JUST SO YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A SENSE OF THIS. ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD GO WITH SAY SINGLE NUMBER AS OPPOSED TO A CPI PLUS NUMBER AND REALIZE THAT CPI PLUS JUST PROVIDED MORE OF THE ECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY. TO TO ADDRESSES WE COULD HAVE SAID AND A PERCENT CAP WHICH AT THIS MOMENT IS EQUIVALENT OF SAY STATEWIDE CPI PLUS FIVE BUT IT JUST MADE MORE SENSE FOR US TO TAILOR IT THIS WAY SO. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SET A STATEWIDE POLICY BUT WITH ENOUGH. REGIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO TO TO MEET NEEDS BUT AGAIN OUTLOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND AND OTHERS TO WELL. TO TO FINE TUNE THE WORK IN PROGRESS. TO GIVE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL FOR THE VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH THAT YOU'VE TAKEN TO IT. I KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AND I'M TO BE PLEASED TO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED MUCH OF WHAT I WOULD WANT TO CONVEY -- I JUST WANT TO SORT OF EMPHASIZE TAKE A STEP BACK THAT THIS IS THIS IS A REALLY BIG STEP FORWARD -- IN THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY AND HELP A LOT OF FOLKS WHO NEED AND DESERVE HELP. AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A BIG STEP FORWARD IN BECAUSE IT'S GOING. TO AFFECT COMMUNITY STATEWIDE MUCH BROADER THAN RENT CONTROL. WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND IF IT'S NOT DESIGNED CORRECTLY COULD MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE A COULD EXACERBATE OUR SUPPLY PROBLEM SO. I THINK THAT -- YOUR APPROACH YOUR TO BE THOUGHTFUL TO TALK TO FOLKS TO FOCUS ON THE TURNER CENTER REPORT TO TASK FOR DATA IS A REALLY REALLY. POSITIVE ONE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DATA ARE WE SHOULD BE MAKING POLICY BASED ON EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH AND DATA. APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SPECIFIC POINTS THE FOLKS HAVE ADDRESSED CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS. TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION IN THAT RESPECT -- ALSO JUST ONE ECHO MY COLLEAGUES WHEN IT COMES TO STABILITY I THINK THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE THAT I THINK THAT IT'S UNFAIR TO RENTERS TO HAVE THINGS PING PONG AROUND I THINK IT WOULD SEND. TERRIBLE MARKET SIGNALS AND COULD EXACERBATE OUR SUPPLY CHALLENGES THE FOR PING PONG AROUND. AND AND ALSO WON'T LET US KNOW FOR WE'RE DOING IS WORKING RIGHT WE WILL BE ABLE TO JUST AGGREGATE WHAT POLICIES ARE DOING THAT ARE ARE ROLLING THE BALL FOR TO WHICH THINGS ARE AREN'T HELPFUL SO -- I I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SUPPORT YOU I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SUPPORT TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY HAS EXPRESSED THAT TODAY -- BUT I JUST WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THIS VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT AND BIG STEP FORWARD -- PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND REALLY LOOKING FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT AND HEALTH OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA -- I GUESS -- OF OF A WRAP UP OF BEFORE OUT CHAIRMAN MAKE HIS CLOSING REMARK -- YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT -- THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE TO HEAR TODAY. ALL GENUINE. IS CHAIRMAN AND THAT YOU ARE APPROACHING THIS ISSUE -- FROM FROM A A FROM FROM A STANDPOINT OF THOUGHT MALICE OF THAT YOU'RE TRYING YOUR BEST TO DO WHAT YOU THINK IS. IS RIGHT FOR OUR STATE -- I JUST WANNA OFFER -- AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF SIR. THAT. AS A FORMER -- RENTER -- I KNOW THAT IN THE IN THE EARLY NINETIES WHERE. MY PARENTS AND I WHEN WE SHARE A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT ON THE CORNER OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE IN SAN DIEGO. OF THE RENT AT THAT TIME. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS A MONTH. THE THE THE ISSUE OF OF OF RENT CONTROL WOULD WOULD NEVER COME UP AND NOT NOT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE A A HOUSING CRISIS WE DIDN'T HAVE A A CRISIS OF OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT FEELING LIKE THEY WERE BEING GALLAGHER -- EVERY MONTH -- AND SO SO SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET FROM THAT POINT TO WHERE WE ARE NOW WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE. OF FUEL LIKE. 90% OF WHAT THEY BRING HOME GOES INTO THEIR AND LANDLORDS POCKETS. AND AND AND I WOULD OFFER THAT -- JUST LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE -- THIS IS A A A MAN MAY PROBLEM BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS WHETHER IT WAS -- IT MAY BE ISM OR WHAT IT WAS -- GOVERNMENT OF POLICY FROM SACRAMENTO OR FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE. DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM. PUTTING MORE HOUSING UNIT ONLINE -- IS IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE. OF BUSINESS SHORTAGE AND THE MARKET DICTATES SO THE PRICE WHEN THERE'S A HOUSING SHORTAGE -- BY A UP. I'M HOPEFUL THAT -- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS -- SERMON THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IN. A COMING UP WITH A COMPROMISE THAT. NOT EVERYONE. CAN BE HAPPY WITH BUT THEY CAN LIVE WITH -- AND AND FOR THAT I'M I'M GOING. TO RESERVE MY VOTE OF TODAY -- AND I'M NOT GONNA VOTE FOR TODAY AND AND HOPE THAT. YOU'RE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF SOLUTION. OF FOR IT ON THE FLOOR SO WITH THAT -- YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU -- I'VE I'VE ALREADY EXPRESSED EACH OF YOU BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY IT AGAIN AND ALSO TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT. I AND CERTAINLY THE ENGAGEMENT IS NOT OVER WHEN THIS BILL LEASES COMMITTEE WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO AN AWFUL LOT OF HARD WORK AND DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS. LET ME ALSO SAY AS YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE -- ADDRESSING THE WORSE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY WILL TAKE ALL OF THE ABOVE SOLUTIONS THIS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THIS BILL. NOR IS -- FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURBO CHARGED PRODUCTION -- IF WE'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE PRESERVE MORE AND PROTECT. OUR CONSTITUENCIES THE THREE PIECE THAT WILL GET US THERE BUT WE NEED TO DO ALL OF THEM AND WE NEED TO DO ALL OF THEM AT ONCE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL PORTION OF AN AGENDA MOVING FORWARD PROTECTIONS OF TENANTS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY. MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE BE ABLE IN THE COMING YEARS TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ASSIST. INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS LIKE MINE AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE IN HONORING CONTROL JURISDICTIONS FIFTEEN MILLION RENTERS WHO COULD BE ASSISTED BOTH BY THIS BILL AND OTHER? MEASURES AROUND JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS ECCENTRIC BUT ARE FOR TODAY I AM VERY MUCH ASK AND AND AND APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF MOVING THIS BILL OUT -- I LOOK FOR TO TO WORKING ENGAGING WITH ALL OF YOU AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THIS IS A BILL TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY. TO FIFTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA RENTERS THAT THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE AN EXORBITANT RENT INCREASE WHILE ALLOWING PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAKE A FAIR RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE MOVE THIS FOR BECAUSE THE RENT IS TOO HIGH WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT.
