00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:42.867
THREE.

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.402
IT SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:46.337
IF THERE BE ANY SPARE COPIES OF

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.405

THREE SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE.

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.394
SO ADDITION ALLOCATING SEATS IN

COUNTED IS REALLY A VERY

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.471
DIFFICULT TASK CRITICALLY AS IT

RELATES TO HARD TO REACH

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:22.907
POPULATIONS.

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.075
THAT AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.209
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.165
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WE

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:48.366

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.476
TO PARTICIPATE.

00:32:58.543 --> 00:32:59.777
THE IMPACT OF THE COMMITTEES ON

00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:01.346
THE COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO REACH

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:04.182

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:05.350
WE STARTED THIS EFFORT BY

THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FILL

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.830
IMPORTANT.

SO ALTHOUGH I STRONGLY BELIEVE

THAT THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:04.522

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.055
SO FEEBLE WE'RE HEARING THAT

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.891
INCIDENT WAS IT SIX FOLLOW UP

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.427
WE CAN'T ADD MORE FOLLOW UP SO I

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:59.396
DON'T KNOW BUT WHERE THINGS WE

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.430

IN THE FACE OF A FEDERAL

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:04.601
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY RUNNING THE

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:05.969
CENSUS COUNT ITSELF.

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.872
TO TRY TO INCREASE THE COUNT.

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.607
WHY?

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:11.842
WELL BASICALLY INTERFACING WITH

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.276
A SYSTEM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:14.378
WANT TO BE COOPERATIVE WITH OUR

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:16.346

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.346
WHICH IS AN OUTREACH PROGRAM.

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.614
GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT THE CENSUS

BUREAU COULD AFFORD TO DO.

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.985

IN MY MIND WHO IS PROBABLY THE

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.825
MOST MEANINGFUL THING YOU CAN DO.

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.726
AND THAT THIS WILL NOT BE

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.328
INEXPENSIVE THAT I IT WILL BE

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.930
VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.865

THINGS ARE GOING ON BETWEEN IT

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:56.146
AND ITS AVAILABILITY.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.447
AND THAT'S WHY HAVING ACCESS

00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:58.849
THAT INFORMATION AND

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:00.250

CENSUS BUREAU HAVE THAT LISTED

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.179
AS ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST CONCERNS.

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:04.180
BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN WHAT'S

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.649
HAPPENED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT

WAS REINFORCED BY MISTER JONES

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:27.037
SAWYER ABOUT THAT THE SANCTITY

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.505
OF THAT INFORMATION THE SECURITY

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.073
OF OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.908
IN THE FACT THAT IT CANNOT BE

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.311
USED FOR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:35.779
PURPOSE. IT WOULD WE HAVE IT A

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:37.347

COMMIT OURSELVES OF THAT FACT.

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:40.951
THEN WE HAVE TO CONVINCE THE

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.852
STAKEHOLDERS OF THAT FACT AND

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.387
EMPOWER THEM TO GOING CAN IT'S

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.222
THEIR COMMUNITIES. OF THAT FACT

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.724
AND IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY YOU

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.125
KNOW THAT IMPORTANT AND

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.360
CHALLENGING.

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.228
EFFORT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:53.630
LOT OF TRUST.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.599
RIGHT NOW AND AND RIGHTFULLY SO

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.700

THE OF THESE TO THOSE TWO

00:53:58.134 --> 00:53:59.769
HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF TIMES THE

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:00.971
GOVERNMENT ON IT ENTITIES HAVE

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.872
TRIED TO TO USE THAT INFO AT

00:54:02.939 --> 00:54:04.274
HAVE BEEN STOPPED.

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:05.842
IS INCREDIBLY HELPFUL DOCTORS

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:06.176
OUT I MEAN.

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:08.411
DOCTOR PAIN IN I WERE WERE IN A

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.480
CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH A

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.715
GROUP OF FOUNDATIONS AND THIS

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:13.049
ISSUE CAME UP AND.

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:14.451
YOU KNOW WE DISCUSSED THE NEED

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:16.252
TO REALLY COME UP WITH MATERIAL

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.687
THAT THAT.

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.255
GIVES PEOPLE THAT CONFIDENCE.

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.991
AND HAVING THOSE TWO HISTORICAL

00:54:21.057 --> 00:54:22.292
EXAMPLES WILL DEFINITELY HELP

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:24.194
WITH THAT BECAUSE.

IN IN EVERY PLACE THAT WE BEEN

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.940

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:01.784
AND IT IN THE IN THE MISSIONS

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.317
THAT REALLY.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.419
THREE YEAR.

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:04.987
OPERATION AND.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:10.025
SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:10.693
I THINK THE INTERESTS ARE ONLINE

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:11.527
AND THESE KEY STRATEGIES I THINK

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:14.029
HAVE TO REMAIN IN PLAY. AND TO

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.065
OUR WEEKLY LOOK FORWARD TO

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.266
SEEING WHERE THINGS WHEN I KNOW

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:18.801
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:19.268
IDEAS RIGHT NOW AND.

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.269
THAT HE PROPOSED ABOUT WHICH

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:21.136
STRATEGIES TO GET MORE FUNDING

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:23.238
VERSUS OTHERS BUT I THINK THE

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:23.739
COMBINATION CAN BE VERY

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:24.707
IMPORTANT.

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:25.240
AND I'LL POINT OUT THAT.

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.910
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE DID THAT

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:29.445
THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.446
AT ALL BUT.

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:31.480
MANY OF FOUNDATIONS THAT YOU

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:32.881
CAN SPEAK TO TODAY PUT UP FROM

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.550
THEIR OWN COFFERS ALMOST NINE

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:37.152
TEN MILLION OF THEIR OWN. AND SO.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.420
IN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.722
HAVING OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:40.656
ENGAGED

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.957
FOUNDATIONS THAT PRETTY STUNNED

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.592
I KIND OF CHALLENGE THEM TO GO

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.327
AHEAD AND MATCH. A WHATEVER WE

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:46.628
DO THE STATE'S SO.

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.430
YOUR TO BE SPENT TO THE MOBILE

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:49.898
AT WORK AND I APPRECIATE IT AND

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:50.999
I THINK PHILANTHROPY HAS BEEN

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:51.934
STEPPING UP.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.837
BUT I THINK THE STATE CAN ALSO.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.105
DO MORE.

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.540
AND I APPRECIATE THE PLAN

01:12:58.607 --> 01:12:59.808
BRASSO THINK THAT ESPECIALLY

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.777
WILL TRY TO REACH OUT TO MORE

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.146
THE YOU KNOW TRUSTED MESSENGERS.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.414
I'M NOT ALL AMERICA HAVE DONE

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.915
AUDITS EVERY YEAR AND ALL THE

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:07.850
SUDDEN.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.618
SO I APPRECIATE CON ABILITY

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.553
PIECE BUT I ALSO WONDER. TO WHAT

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.521
DEGREE.

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.790
THAT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.892
US TO ENGAGE SOME OF THAT

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.228
TRUSTED MANAGED MESSENGERS AND.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.163
MORE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.564
AND AND MORE MARGINALIZED

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:25.067
COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND SO HOW

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:26.201
WE PARTNER WITH OUR

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.936
PHILANTHROPIC AND OTHER.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:30.205
NONPROFIT CPOS AND SO FORTH

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.473
THAT TO TO REALLY REACH OUT YOU

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.074
KNOW THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.343
ARE WATCHING MAINSTREAM MEDIA.

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:35.677
THERE MAY NOT BE THE ONES WHO

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:36.979
ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:40.015
BUT YOU KNOW WE GOT IT MANY

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.384
TAKE SOME. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.353
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO GET THEM

01:13:44.419 --> 01:13:46.021
AND ALSO BE SURE WE PROVIDE

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.790
SUPPORT THAT ARE YOU KNOW. AT

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:49.591
OUR LOCAL LEVELS WELL UMPIRE

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:51.226
CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.594
BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:55.364
RESOURCES TO IT BECAUSE THEY

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.864
HAVE A LOT MORE TO LOCAL

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:56.632
CONNECTION.

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.200
SO IT'S ONE BE SURE WE ARE YOU

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:58.801
KNOW POSITIONING OURSELVES FOR

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.636
THAT.

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:01.570
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:02.704
THERE ARE SOME NEVER GONNA JONES

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.106
SAWYER.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:06.275
SO SO I ALSO.

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:07.843
DON'T LIKE REINVENT WILL TAUGHT

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.844
HOUSE WANNA KNOW WHAT DIDN'T

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.045
WORK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.980
SEEMS LIKE A AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:12.548
WORKED.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:14.416
BUT HE DID WORK IN MY.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:17.452
COMMUNITY BEFORE SO BESIDES ME

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.555
BLAMING MY PREDECESSOR I NEED TO

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:22.658
KNOW SPECIFICALLY. HOME.

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.960
WHAT I CAN DO DIFFERENTLY

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:25.861
TO GET MY NUMBERS UP THE MORE

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.596
IMPORTANT?

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.431
WHAT WE DIDN'T DO OR?

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.233
WHAT DO WE DO SO A STRATEGY WE

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.434
THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WORK AN

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.635
ABSOLUTELY FAILED CAN YOU

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:35.204
PINPOINT?

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.306
WITH SOME SPECIFICITY TO EACH OF

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.007
OUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WHAT

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:40.475
WORKED SOME.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.277
THIS WORKED GREAT FOR AND THERE

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.512
DAY OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS OF

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:44.980
SUCCESS.

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:46.782
BUT THERE SOME THAT IT DIDN'T

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.584
WORK FOR TO YOU YOU CAN'T GIVE.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.220
EVERY DISTRICT IT KIND OF.

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.955
BOILERPLATE THIS IS WHAT WILL

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.623
WORK IN EVERY DISTRICT SO WHICH

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:55.824
ARE RUN BY REPORT FROM TWO

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.059
THOUSAND BUT I WAS JUST LOOKING

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:57.926
AT YESTERDAY AND.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:15:00.495
ACTUALLY THE AREAS THAT WE IN

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:01.930
TWO THOUSAND WE ONLY INVESTED

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:02.898
AREAS THAT WERE HARD TO COUNT

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.166
THAT HAD A HIGH INTO ACCOUNT.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.001
AND IN THE CITY OF COMPTON IT

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.436
HAD THE HIGHEST INCREASE

01:15:07.502 --> 01:15:08.770
A RETURN RATE IT WAS SIXTEEN

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.339
PERCENT SO WAS A RICH IT WENT UP

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:11.473
TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SO

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.141
WHAT'S MINUS SIXTEEN. AND THEN

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.043
SANTA ANA ALSO HAD A FOURTEEN

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.145
PERCENT INCREASE AND AMANTE HOW

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.013
THE FOURTEEN PERCENT INCREASE I

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.547
JUST REMEMBER THOSE THREE

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:19.882
BECAUSE I WROTE THEM DOWN. FOR

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:21.350
YESTERDAY'S HEARING AND THAT'S

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.918
WHERE WE ACTUALLY INVESTED ON

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:25.420
THE GROUND WE PUT A YOU KNOW

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.555
QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE IN

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.090
THERE AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.124
FINE IT'S ACTUALLY CAME BACK TO

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.259
THE DEMOGRAPHICS RESURGENT AND

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:31.793
THEY DID THIS ANALYSIS SO IT'S

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.195
ON OUR WEBSITE. AS YOU CAN SEE

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:34.997
THE CITY BY CITY WHERE THE

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.064
UNDERCOUNT WAS IN NINETEEN

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.165
NINETY WHERE WE INVEST IN TWO

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.534
THOUSAND AND THE THE INCREASE SO.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:40.836
I KNOW FOR THAT WAS FOR TWO

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:42.304
THOUSAND SO FOR TWO THOUSAND TEN

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.939
WE DIDN'T DO MUCH BECAUSE WE

01:15:44.006 --> 01:15:45.474
DON'T HAVE A DOLLARS SO THAT

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.108
MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:47.776
BACK TO. BUT WE ONLY HAD TWO

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.011
MILLION DOLLARS IN A TWO

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.446
THOUSAND TEN. AND SO WE NEED TO

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.081
SHIP IT TO THE TOP TWELVE OUR

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:55.350
HARDEST ACCOUNT COUNTIES AND

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.919
THEN THEY DISTRIBUTE FROM THERE

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:57.552
I THINK THAT'S WHICH CHAIRS A

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:58.654
GETTING TO. GIVE US SOME

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.122
RATIONALE FOR WHY WE NEED TO PUT

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.123
MORE MONEY.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.292
IN THIS TO GET IT DONE.

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:04.726
I THINK JUST TO ADD ONE OF THAT

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.361
BOTH REPORTS FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:07.796
AND TEN HAVE.

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.564
FLAG THE ISSUE OF STARTING TO

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.300
THE EIGHT AS A PLATFORM LEARNED.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.868
LIKE THE COMPLETE CAO

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.569
COMMITTEES BOTH TIMES STARTED

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.538
I'M. LIKE TWENTY THOUSAND

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.040
STARTING NOVEMBER NINETEEN I'M

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:19.641
AND THE SUCH AS OF APRIL TWO

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.776
THOUSAND TO DEFLECT.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.744
SIX MONTHS TO WORK WITH AND THEN

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:24.913
IN IN TWENTY TEN BACK THE

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.715
COMPANY STARTED IN JUNE TWO

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.583
THOUSAND NINE AGAIN JUST BE EAT

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:29.518
LESS THAN A YEAR PRIOR TO THE

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:30.852
SENSE THAT SAID THERE'S VERY

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:32.821
LITTLE TIME. TO STRATEGIZE AND

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:33.221
DEPLOY.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:35.590
AND SO I THINK.

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:36.992
THAT WAS THE KEY MASS AND I FOR

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.527
ALL OF US TO GET TOGETHER SOONER

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:40.295
WORK TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY THAN

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.630
WE EVER HAVE BEFORE BECAUSE IT

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.665
IS A MUTUAL INTEREST TO ALL OF

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:46.001
US AND TO STRATEGIZING. AND THAT

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.502
I THINK WE TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.904
AND WE'VE AND WE STARTED WITH

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:50.238
THE LOOK OF PROCESS IN AND

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.474
BUILDING THAT AND. THE LOOK AT

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.242
DIFFERENT VOTERS HAVE AND LATE

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.278
TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR FOUR YEARS

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:57.512
AND IT. IN ADVANCE OF THE FACETS

01:16:57.579 --> 01:17:00.248
OF SUCH THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:01.483
THE DATA ON YOU HOUSING

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.250
CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:03.452
FROM

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.553
TO GET HIM FOR YEARS ADVANCE GET

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:05.787
GET THE BALL ROLLING.

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:06.888
SO I THINK ANOTHER LESSON

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:07.823
LEARNED WOULD BE.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.124
THE COORDINATION WITH THE U. S.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.460
CENSUS BUREAU DOING IT EARLIER.

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.628
WERE HEAD OF THE CENSUS BUREAU

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:14.730
RIGHT NOW THEY AND LITERALLY

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:17.265
HAVE LIKE FOUR PARTNERSHIP

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:17.899
SPECIALIST ACROSS THE STATE FOR

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.368
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.570
AND SO WE'RE STARTING WERE SO

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:22.637
FAR AHEAD OF THEM THAT THEY'RE

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.672
KIND OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO PLAY

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.973
CATCH UP WITH US.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.174
ALL AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL HIRE

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.509
PEOPLE IN NOVEMBER OF THIS

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:31.813
NOVEMBER.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.181
SO SO ON THAT FRIGHTENED DO THIS

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:33.715
YOU MENTION THIS IN YOUR

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:35.117
COMMENTS BUT WE ASK SOMEBODY

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.052

01:17:38.854 --> 01:17:40.355
AND ON UNFORTUNATELY THEY THEY

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:41.723
DECLINED OUR INVITATION.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:43.692
SO WE HOPE THAT.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:46.294
THEY'LL BE BETTER COORDINATION

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.863
WITH THEM MOVING FORWARD.

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.865
BUT YOU YOU ALSO MENTION THAT

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:50.932
THEY'RE QUITE BEHIND.

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.234
JUST HERE CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.502
QUITE BEHIND AND IN THE ENTIRE

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:56.772
PROCESS WHAT CAN WE DO TO FILL

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.340
GAPSTHAT THEY'RE LEAVING. YEAH

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.808
UNFORTUNATELY THEY RUN THE

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.209
CENSUS AND WE CAN TAKE OVER THAT

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.778
BUT BUT ARE THE YOU KNOW IF

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.346
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE YOU SEE

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.381
THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY'RE

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.283
NOT THAT MEETING THEIR THEIR

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:09.885
CALENDAR IN THEIR TIMELINE ON

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:10.685
THINGS.

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.054
YEAH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LET

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.822
US KNOW IF IF THERE WAYS THAT WE

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:16.358
CAN SUPPORT YOU. ON TO IT TO

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.260
FILL THOSE GAPS THAT THERE'D.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.828
LIKELY GONNA LEAVE OUR

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:20.128
COMMUNITIES.

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.063
.

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.497
ANY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE GOT A

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:23.698
COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:26.468
BUT UMPS YES A GO GO FOR NOW YOU

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:27.202
BELIEVE.

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:28.937
SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.605
IS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:31.440
STRATEGIES THAT WORK AND THEN

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:32.441
WORK WE CERTAINLY CAN LOOK AT

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.809
PREVIOUS SENSES.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.944
THEIR SOME THINGS ARE DIFFERENT

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:36.645
THE ONLINE.

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.280
IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:42.250
DOING WHY YELL PRACTICE RUNS ARE

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:42.918
DRY RUNS.

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.454
I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.988
GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.890
HAVE TO TO TEST DIFFERENT

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:49.391
STRATEGIES AND DIFFERENT

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:50.158
COMMUNITIES.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.360
BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU KNOW

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.795
PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE RIGHT

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:55.197
AND THEN WHEN THE REAL THING

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:55.630
COMES.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:19:00.802
ABOUT THAT.

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.571
ABOUT TESTING DIFFERENT

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.372
STRATEGIES AND DOING SOME DRY

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:05.307
RUNS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:06.775
SEE HOW DIFFERENT.

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.477
EFFORTS MAY WORK OUT.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.945
SO RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.480
MESSAGE TESTING ON COORDINATION

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:14.216
GROUP ARE THAT HAS MANY OF THE

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:15.383
FOLKS THAT YOU'RE GONNA COME UP

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:17.886
UP AND SPEAK IN OTHERS. ON THAT

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:18.620
ARE ALREADY DOING MESSAGE

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.388
TESTING OUT IN THE FIELD.

01:19:20.455 --> 01:19:23.158
SO THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST THING

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:24.192
AND OF COURSE THE FIRST ONE AND

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.128
WE DO IN WAVES THE FIRST WAVE OF

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:28.263
MESSAGING MRS TESTING RIGHT NOW

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:28.864
IS GOING TO BE TRUE DIFFERENT

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.399
THAN A YEAR FROM NOW. SO WE ARE

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.602
HEAD THE US CENSUS BUREAU IS

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.569
DOING WHAT THEY CALL SEE BANDS

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.805
CENSUS BARRIERS ATTITUDES AND

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.006
MOTIVATORS AND CONSIDERING IT

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:38.640
NATIONALLY AND THEY HAVE A FEW

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:39.641
FOCUS GROUPS HERE.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:40.775
BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:42.577
THE GRANULARITY THAT WE NEED FOR

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:45.247
OUR COMMUNITIES SO MANY OF THE

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.448
PARTNERS WERE ALREADY WORKING

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:47.716
WITH ARE DOING THAT NECESSARY

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.918
STING. I'M IN TERMS OF SORT OF

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.253
DRESS REHEARSAL WE CAN'T REALLY

DRESS REHEARSED THE OPERATIONS A

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.923
ONE WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.457
QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:56.258
BECAUSE THE HASN'T BEEN

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:58.927
COMPLETED. I DID DO A BETA TEST

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:01.096
OF THE ONLINE AND INTERNET

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:06.034
SUFFER SPOTS TOOL LAST APRIL. OF

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:07.235
THE USER EXPERIENCE LEFT

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:08.803
A LOT TO BE DESIRED SO I THINK

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:10.205
IN ARE CONVENING AS WE CONTINUE

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:13.108

LIKE I WANT TO BE PERFORMED.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.052
AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE BEING

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.255
VERY CREATIVE TO SAY THE SUCH AS

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:27.889

ABOUT WHAT WORKS IN THE

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.633
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE ANSWERS

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.734
COME FROM WORSE IN YOUR

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:40.368
COMMUNITIES I CAN'T MAKE IT UP

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:41.903
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT UP RIGHT. SO

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:42.504
IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO BE OUT

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:56.603
AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM DO THAT

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:57.838
BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU

01:42:57.905 --> 01:42:59.039
RAISE A VERY GOOD POINT IN TERMS

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:00.641
OF. THIS WHOLE NOTION OF TRUST

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:03.076
IN HIM IN GOVERNMENT AND I THINK

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:05.012
WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO TO HELP

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:06.914
NOT ONLY EDUCATE FOLKS. ABOUT

01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.650
THE MECHANICS OF THE PROCESS BUT

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:11.585
ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:13.086
HOW IT WILL BE USED AND HOW WILL

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:15.355
NOT BE USEDYET SO WE'VE GOT

01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:17.791
MORE WORK MORE WORK TO DO THERE.

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:18.959
THE IS THAT YOUR CARRY YEAH I

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:20.561
JUST DONE ON ME.

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:21.962
ONE OF THINGS LIKE AT. ALL OF

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.797
THE MEMBERS WHAT ABOUT THE NON

MEMBER CITY SINCE OUR WAY THAT

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.266
WE CAN HELP REACH OUT IN SOME

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.434
WAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'S

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.369
PLENTY THAT. DO NOT PARTICIPATE

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:31.204
IN ONLY A CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.673
DID HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF COURSE

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:34.107
MY IDEAS OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE

01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:36.977
TO DO SO. AND CONCERNED ABOUT

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.912
SOME AYE RURAL AREAS.

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.447
THEY ALWAYS SAY WE NEVER GET

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:41.081
ANYTHING WE DON'T GET ANYTHING

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.416
FOR IT ON THE TABLE AND THEY

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:43.317
DON'T WANT TO BE THERE SO. HAS

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:45.085
THERE BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ON

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:45.652
WHAT WE DO ABOUT NON MEMBER

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:46.553
CITIES.

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:47.988
WE WE HAVE.

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.924
AYE HANDFUL OF NON MEMBER

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:52.326
CITIES THAT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:54.728
IDENTIFY AND SUPPLEMENT BEEN

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:56.396
OUTREACH TO THEM BUT I I THINK

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.966
THE POINT YOU YOU REYES ALSO. A

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:01.835
SPEAKS TO NATIVE AND NON ENGAGED

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:03.537
MEMBER THAT PERSON DOESN'T OPEN.

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:06.473
THE THAT THAT THE TEMPE MALE OR

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.507
THE TWENTIETH EMAIL THAT MIGHT

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:08.342
COME TO THEM.

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:10.477
WE HAVE NOT CITED ANY SPECIFIC

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:12.379
STRATEGIES YET TO A BETTER

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.513
ENGAGE THEM.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.782
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT IT'S

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.951
GOING TO BE ON MY LIST.

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:18.952
I FIND THIS HEARING IS GOOD

01:44:19.019 --> 01:44:20.621
POINT AND AND IF THERE'S A WAY

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:21.555
TO TO. LET ALL OF US KNOW WHICH

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.824
CITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS AREN'T

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.058
MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW THE BEST

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.693
WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE WE CAN

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.195
THEN REACH OUT TO THEM ALSO

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:29.096
BECAUSE IT AYE THAT I KNEW

REALIZE THAT. AND THAT'S A GREAT

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:31.164
POINT.

01:44:31.231 --> 01:44:32.566
WHERE IF THE NON THE LESS THAN

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:34.234

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:36.503
THEN THROUGH OUR CONTACTS

01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:37.504
ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO DO THEM

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:38.672
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.486
SIXTEEN REGIONS ACROSS THE

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.955
STATE WHO ARE A MORE FAMILIAR

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:56.156

SOME OF THE CITIES THAT ARE JUST.

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:21.048
NON RESPONSIVE.

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:23.050
MY LOOK FOR YOU HELPING US.

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.217
MS PART YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU

HEARTENED TO HEAR ABOUT HOW

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:25.752

LIKE ARAB THEN AND THE

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:32.726
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO.

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:37.197
HOW ARE THEIR PLANS HOW CAN WE?

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.199
SHARE THAT INFORMATICS YOU FIND

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:40.267
OUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S

01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:41.868
NOT HOW CAN WE.

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.136
YEAH SUFFERS THE TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:45.839
OF THAT TO SHARE IT TO THE OTHER

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:46.473
FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES ACROSS THE

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.041
STATE.

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:50.744
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS PROVIDE

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:53.580
THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WITH ALL

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:53.814
OF OUR.

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.916
.

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:57.217
THEY ARE DIFFERENT TEMPLATES

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:57.951
MANNER USING HIM.

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.220
IN ESTABLISHING OBJECTIVES AND

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:02.956
STRATEGIES HOW TO DO A WORK PLAN.

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:06.093
AND HOW TO SET THAT UP AND ALSO

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:08.929
HOW TO DEVELOP ACTIVITY SHEETS

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:10.263
FOR DOWN THE ROAD BUT WE

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:11.498
ACTUALLY START ROLLING OUT

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:14.267
EVENTS. AT PARKS AND LIBRARIES

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:15.702
IN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:17.904
IS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:18.772
SCHEDULING CONFLICTS THAT WE

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:21.608
MAKE SURE WE ARE FILLING THE GAP

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:21.842
BETWEEN.

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:22.776
.

01:46:22.843 --> 01:46:25.645
SO BASICALLY THAT IS ONE MAJOR

01:46:25.712 --> 01:46:26.980
WAY THAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE JUST

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.582
BASICALLY SHARE EVERYTHING WITH

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:29.549
THE US CENSUS BUREAU WHOSE

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:30.751
INTERN TRAINING.

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.219
I THINK THEY'VE TRAINED A FEW

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:34.321
COUNTIES ALREADY AND THERE CAN

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:35.489

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:37.124
TRAINING TEMPLATES THAT THEY'RE

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:39.292
USING THAT THEY DEAD WE WEEPING

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.361
GIVING ANYBODY WHO WANTS OUR

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:43.430
INFORMATION IT'S IT'S AVAILABLE

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:44.397
TO THEM PERFECT WHEN YOU WHEN

01:46:44.464 --> 01:46:45.766
YOU SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.434
THE US CENSUS BUREAU DO YOU HAVE

01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:48.301

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:48.502
YEAH.

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.537
.

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.539
SORRY FOR THE UNSOLICITED PLUG.

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:54.908
BUT THAT'S GREAT AGAIN AS WE

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.009
DEFINITELY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.611
A LOT OF THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:59.746
THE RESOURCES A. LA COUNTY HAS

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:00.380
AND AND DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:01.381
WORKING ON.

01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:03.717
THE CENSUS THAT SO IMPORTANT SO

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.085
WE HAD YET A DIFFERENT ONE AT.

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:06.353
THAT TAKE AS MUCH ADVANTAGE OF

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:07.754
THE GOOD WORKS YOU'RE DOING IS

01:47:07.821 --> 01:47:08.555
POSSIBLE.

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.190
AND THEN TO THE EXTENT I KNOW

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.558
THAT OUR NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:12.726
BE ON COMMUNITY BASED

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.528

TABLES AYE TO DEVELOP THEIR

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.248
GENERAL PLAN WHICH WILL BE

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:37.350
DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT.

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:37.818
LATER.

01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:39.553
AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE

WORKING WITH THEM ON AS WELL AS

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:44.457
OTHERS IS IDENTIFYING GAPS NAM.

01:47:44.524 --> 01:47:47.260
SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT.

01:47:47.327 --> 01:47:49.529
WHERE WE'RE LITERALLY GOING

01:47:49.596 --> 01:47:51.865
BLOCK BY BLOCK GROUP TO IDENTIFY

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:53.700
WHAT CAN'T COVERAGE THEY CAN

PROMISING IN ENTER DELIVERING IN

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.073
THE END OF THE DAY THERE ARE

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.641
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CAN HELP

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:04.511
OUT LIKE I SAID UNIONS. COUNTY

01:48:04.578 --> 01:48:05.512
EMPLOYEES.

SO WORTH LOOKING AT THEIR

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.649
CAPACITY WHAT'S WITHIN THEIR

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:13.019
CAPACITY AND THEN HOW WE CAN

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.995
WAY OF ATTACKING THE.

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:23.430
THE EFFORT. AND THE CAMPAIGN SO

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:24.865
THAT'S REALLY.

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:27.500
OUR PRIMARY EFFORT RIGHT NOW IS

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:29.502
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:31.071
AS THEY DEVELOP MORE AND MORE OF

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.806
THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND HOW THEY

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:34.307
WANT TO APPROACH.

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:36.576
OUTREACH AND AND FIGURING OUT

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.912
WITH THEM WE SEND THEM LISTS OF

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:40.614
CBO'S THAT WE OBTAIN FROM OUR

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.649
BOARD OFFICES FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:43.383
MEMBERS.

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:46.019
AND THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO BE

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:48.188
THE PERFECT MAN AND THEY ALSO

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.856

SO THERE'S GONNA BE LIMITATIONS

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:56.563
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO ALL BE

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.331
PITCHING IN TOGETHER BUT WE ARE

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:01.268

YES THIS PART OF THE FIFTY OUT

01:50:08.101 --> 01:50:09.970
THAT BOTH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:11.471
HOW I TELL ALL WORK TOGETHER SO

01:50:11.538 --> 01:50:12.939

FOR TWELVE MILLION WHICH WILL

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.876
COME OUT OF THAT FIFTY OR

WHATEVER THE FINAL. AMOUNT IS SO

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.147
SOME OF US WANT MUCH MORE THAN

FIFTY SO IF WELL WHAT THEY'VE

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:27.754
HER AND SO DID I PUT IT INTO THE

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:29.356
DIRE IT WELL IT IS THE PER THE

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.957
CURRENT PERSPECTIVE IS. THAT THE

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:31.491
STATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUT

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:32.125
PROPOSED BUDGET HAS ONE MILLION

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:34.227
STATEWIDE FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.628
TWO MILLION STATEWIDE FOR THE

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:36.863
SECOND YEAR AND WHAT WE'RE

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.698
SAYING IS THAT THREE MILLION

01:50:38.765 --> 01:50:44.070
DOLLARS. IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:45.071
ENOUGH.

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:46.272
IT'S NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DO.

01:50:46.339 --> 01:50:47.774
TO ADDRESS LA COUNTY AND IN

01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:49.142
PARTICULAR.

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:50.076
AND PROBABLY OTHER COUNTY SINCE

01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:52.112
WELL BUT CERTAINLY FOR LA COUNTY

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:53.813
IT'S NOT GOOD TO ALLOW US TO DO

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.048
AS ROBUST AN EFFORT AS WE'D LIKE

01:50:55.115 --> 01:50:57.384

01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:57.851
HAS THERE BEEN A.

01:50:58.618 --> 01:50:59.853

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.075
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THE BOARD

01:55:16.142 --> 01:55:17.210
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S NOTHING

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:18.211
MORE IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE'S

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:19.879
HEALTH THEN THEIR SENSE OF

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:22.248
AGENCY OR BELONGING.

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:22.849
HOW WE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:23.483
DICTIONARY AND LOOK TO THE WORD

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:24.250
COUNT?

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:25.285
AND YOU SEE THINGS LIKE

01:55:25.351 --> 01:55:26.886
ASSIGNING WORTH OR DESERVING OF

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:28.688
CONSIDERATION.

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:30.556
AND THE OPPOSITE ACCOUNT ARE YOU

01:55:30.623 --> 01:55:31.658
FIND WORDS LIKE TO EXCLUDE

01:55:31.724 --> 01:55:33.559
ACCOUNT HOW.

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:35.895
SO WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS AS OUR

01:55:35.962 --> 01:55:37.196
SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND BOARD THE

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:38.464
THOUGHT OF FOURTEEN MILLION

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:40.133
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FOURTEEN

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:40.933
MILLION CALIFORNIANS. BEING

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.735
COUNTED OUT.

01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:43.970
POSES A VERY SERIOUS THREAT TO

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.405
THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE OF

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.173
CALIFORNIA AND TO THE.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.709
A HEALTH OF OUR STATE.

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.044
I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.445
BIT OF FLAVOR OF THAT THERE

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:53.046
FOLKS HERE WITH MORE EXPERTISE

01:55:53.112 --> 01:55:54.947
THAN I HAVE. BITE PARA MILLION

01:55:55.014 --> 01:55:56.616
OF THOSE AT RISK FOR BEING UNDER

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.484
COUNTED ARE BLACK CALIFORNIANS

01:55:58.551 --> 01:56:00.386
FIVE MILLION ARE LATINO TWO

01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:00.887
HUNDRED THOUSAND NATIVE

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:02.021
AMERICANS.

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:04.924
SO HAD THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY.

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:06.426
POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK

01:56:06.492 --> 01:56:08.628
FOR DISPARATE HEALTH OUTCOMES

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:09.562
AND POPULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:10.930
BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:13.366
I'M.

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:14.734
I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M GLAD

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:16.369
MEMBERS EARLIER MENTIONED THE

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:17.970
ACA UNCOVERED CALIFORNIA EFFORT

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.205
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:20.773
SOME PARALLELS. THERE THAT

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:21.541
REALLY YOU CAN'T FIND IN

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:23.443
PREVIOUS CENSUS.

01:56:23.509 --> 01:56:25.111
FRANKLY IN PREVIOUS CENSUS WE

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:26.846
HAD OVER PERCEIVED A GOOD FAITH

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:28.681
PARTNERS IN DC.

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:29.749
BUT WHEN THE ACA LAUNCHED IN

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:32.185
CALIFORNIA IT WAS VERY TOXIC

01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.453
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAND

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:35.054
YOU'LL REMEMBER THE DEATH PANELS.

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:36.989
AND OTHER NEGATIVITY SO WE HAD

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:38.191
TO OVERCOME A LOT OF THAT EVEN

01:56:38.257 --> 01:56:39.459
HEARING CALIFORNIA AMONG PEOPLES

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:41.561
PERCEPTIONS. AND IT WAS IT TOOK

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:43.463
A HERCULEAN EFFORT THE ENDOWMENT

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:44.230
ALONE SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:45.365
DOLLARS ARE OUTREACH AND

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:46.966
EDUCATION. TO COUNTER SOME OF

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:48.234
THAT NEGATIVITY AND GET PEOPLE

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:50.303
TO SIGN UP AND FOR THE MOST PART

01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:52.271
IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT.

01:56:52.338 --> 01:56:54.006
I'M BUT I DID LIKE YOUR QUESTION

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:55.842
EARLIER MISTER JONES SAWYER

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:57.477
ABOUT WHAT DIDN'T WORK.

01:56:57.543 --> 01:56:59.078
AND SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:01.647
IN TERMS OF THE ACA. AS WELL AND

01:57:01.714 --> 01:57:02.682
A COUPLE OF THINGS CAME TO MIND

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:04.183
YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY EXCITED AT

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.952
THE LAUNCH OF THAT EFFORT. THAT

01:57:06.018 --> 01:57:07.787
WE COULDN'T CONVINCE DR OZ TO

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.622
MAKE IT OUT FOR US.

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:11.157
AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALL THE

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.625
MESSAGE TESTING TYPE PERSUASIVE

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:14.327
MESSAGES MESSENGERS AND HE WAS

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:16.329
OFF THE CHARTS AT THAT TIME.

01:57:16.396 --> 01:57:18.064
AND DO YOU KNOW HE TO HIS

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:19.866
CREDIT HE FLEW OUT HAD NEVER

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.267
TAKEN A POSITION ON THE AC TO

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:22.769
THAT POINT. HE MADE THE AD. ABA

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:24.070
WHAT WE DISCOVERED OVER THE

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:26.506
COURSE OF THAT EFFORT IS THAT

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:27.373
THERE WERE THINGS WERE FAR MORE

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.308
EFFECTIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE MULTI

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:30.977
ETHNIC MEDIA INVESTMENTS WE MADE.

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:31.944
PRODUCED MORE AND SOME

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.346
UNCONVENTIONAL THINGS TO GO TO

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:35.415
SOME QUESTIONS EARLIER. IN THE

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:36.516
WEEK THAT THE MONEY WE PUT INTO

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:38.418
BARBERSHOP NETWORKS THE NUMBER

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:41.854
OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE PUT INTO.

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:44.724
A WRESTLER'S ASSOCIATION

01:57:44.791 --> 01:57:45.691
ON YOU TUBE AND GIVES A VERY

01:57:45.758 --> 01:57:46.325
UNCONVENTIONAL THINGS ENDED UP

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:46.859
DELIVERING SOME SURPRISING

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:48.594
RESULTS.

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:49.162

01:57:57.970 --> 01:57:59.105
THE HISTORY.

01:57:59.172 --> 01:58:00.273
BUT WHAT REALLY STOOD OUT FOR ME

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:01.240
WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF TRUSTED

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:02.575
MESSENGERS AND HOW THAT HASN'T

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:04.477

AND ONE OF THE MAIN LESSONS

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:17.557

TO DISCLOSE WHO'S IN YOUR HOUSE.

02:04:58.057 --> 02:04:59.458
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO FEAR ABOUT

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.960
CONFIDENTIALITY HOW THE

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:02.561
INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:03.462
THAT EXTENDS BEYOND THE

02:05:03.529 --> 02:05:05.865
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. TO THE

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:06.999

AND SO WE WE KNOW THAT THESE

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:14.373
CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.609

SO WHAT DID WE DO IN TWENTY

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:23.215
TRENT TEN THAT WE THOUGHT WORKED

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:25.184

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:34.126
AREA.

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:35.694
TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION

02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:38.464
THESE WARRANTS IN HARD TO COUNT

02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:40.833
AREAS OF OUR COUNTY. A WE ALSO

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:41.934
RAN BUS ADS AND I WON THE LIFT

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:44.169
THAT UP BECAUSE BUS ADS THROUGH.

02:05:44.236 --> 02:05:46.972
HIGH DENSITY AREAS WITH HARD TO

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:48.607
COUNT POPULATIONS WAS A GREAT

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:51.377
WAY TO ELEVATE THE AWARENESS.

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:53.245
A IN THE POPULATION NOW IF WE

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.314
DIDN'T HAVE TO SPEND OUR MONEY

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:57.249
TO DO THAT OR YOUR MONEY AS A

02:05:57.316 --> 02:05:59.518
WATER. OF BUT IT'S IT WE HAD

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:01.053
STATE RESOURCES OR LOCAL

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.588
RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THOSE SORTS

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:04.023
OF ACTIVITIES. THAT WOULD BE

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.724
GRANT.

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:07.493
A IN AND SO WE WERE HIGHLY

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.695
EFFECTIVE IN DOING OUR OUTREACH

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.630
TO THE COMMUNITY AND THAT WAS

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:12.865
BECAUSE OF ONE REASON AND ONE

02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:14.166
REASON ONLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:15.634
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:17.603
WITH A COMMUNITY. THAT'S BEEN

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:19.138
SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN HERE

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:21.340

02:06:24.677 --> 02:06:25.711
THIS EQUATION IS THE

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:27.012
RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST THAT WE

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:28.948

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.349
CRITICAL TO PARTNER WITH US

02:06:30.416 --> 02:06:33.252

WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS A

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:42.528
CONCERTED EFFORT.

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:45.197
