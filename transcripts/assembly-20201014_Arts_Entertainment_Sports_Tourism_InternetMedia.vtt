WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS A

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:11.715
MULTI PHASED APPROACH OF KIND

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.655
PIVOT IN STATE CALLING ALL

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:20.891
CALIFORNIANS CAMPAIGN PAYS

FEEDER AND AGAIN WE JUST WE

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:26.263
REACT TO CONSUMER SENTIMENT SO-

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.031

GETTING ON AIRPLANES- AND THAT

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.923
WOULD BREACH OVER 50% OF THEIR

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:55.559
INTEREST IN TRAVELING THAT FAR.

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.761

INTERNATIONAL HOWEVER WE'VE

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:53.150
KEPT A- I'LL A LOW THRESHOLD

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.819
RETAINER BECAUSE WHEN WE START

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.558
SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE WE

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:04.461

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.496
IT'S AS YOU DESCRIBED A VERY

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:09.099
DIRE SITUATION AND A WAYS OFF

RIGHT NOW. I GUESS ONE OTHER

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:14.571
QUESTION IS THAT. FROM MY

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:15.772
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT'S

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.140
SORT OF THAT IN YOUR MESSAGING

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:20.210
IS THAT- THE STATE'S THAT SHOW

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.113
THE BEST RECORD AND KEEPING THE

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.281

FOR FURTHER ON IN THIS HEARINGS

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:34.925
THAT WE'RE LOSING IT TO OTHER

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:37.594
STATES BUT I WOULD POINT OUT

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.129
THAT A LOT OF THE OTHER STATES

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.130
ARE HAVING INCREASING CASES AND

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.731
IF YOU'RE MAKING A RESERVATION

00:51:41.798 --> 00:51:43.166
FOR WHETHER IT'S TWENTY TWENTY

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:45.735
ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WE

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:48.171
SHOULD BE TALKING TO PEOPLE

STATE'S NOT TAKING IT SERIOUSLY

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:00.617
I THINK WE CAN NAME SOME STATES

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:02.452
WHERE LEADERSHIP HASN'T.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.287
DETERRED YOU YOU MAY FIND

SUDDENLY HAVING TO THE STAND

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.091
EVEN IF KOBE IT'S ACTUALLY

VERY SMALL MEETINGS TO DIP

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.412

FOCUSING ON. SMALL ENGAGEMENTS

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.764
OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED JUST TO

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.733
START DOWN THAT PATHWAY AND

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:52.202
ESTABLISH WHAT WORKS IN TERMS

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:52.702

00:53:31.007 --> 00:53:32.842
YOU'LL HEAR THE FRUSTRATION OF

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.377
THE PANEL THAT'S COMING AFTER

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:37.514
ME ABOUT. HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:40.183
TO ENFORCE THIS WITH CONSUMERS

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.419
AND HAVING THAT UNANIMITY SO-

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.588
THAT'S WHY WE KIND OF STEPPED

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:46.990
IN TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT COVER

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.124
FOR THE INDUSTRY IT'S SO

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.727
IMPORTANTAND WE SUBSCRIBE TO

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:54.898
THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:55.999
YOU MANAGER OUT ONE QUICK

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.167
QUESTION ONE MORE QUESTION THE

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.501
QUESTION IS YOU REFERENCE THE

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.170
FACT THAT CONVENTION BUSINESS

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.638
IS NOT COMING IN CALIFORNIA

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:03.540
IT'S GOING ELSEWHERE I'M

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.842
ASSUMING IT'S STAYING IN THE

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.110
STATES WHERE THE ODDITIES

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.812
ASSOCIATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.480
ARE WE LOSING CONVENTION

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.815
BUSINESS TO OTHER STATES THAT

00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:14.017
ARE SOMEHOW MORE COMPETITIVE

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:15.952
WITH US- AND IT'S NOT ABOUT

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.654
KIND OF TRY TO MINIMIZE TRAVEL.

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.489
THERE IS THERE IS A CROSS CUT

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.358
WERE WERE ACTUALLY LOSING

00:54:21.424 --> 00:54:23.693
BUSINESSES TO OTHER STATES I

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.762
DON'T WANT TO ARTICULATE TO SAY

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.797
THAT WE LOST SIXTY FIVE BILLION

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.666
SO THERE FOR SIXTY FIVE BILLION

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.468
IS GOING ELSEWHERE THERE IS A

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:32.636
PIECE OF THAT THAT'S GOING

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.104
ELSEWHERE THERE'S A PIECE THAT

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.306
STAYING CLOSER TO HOME THAT WE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.174
KNOW BECAUSE WE TALKED OR ARE

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:40.510
COMPETITON EVERY DAY OF THE

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.945
OTHER STATES BOOKING AND

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:43.580
PICKING UP THAT BUSINESS IT MAY

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:46.116
NOT BE HOLISTICALLY SIXTY SIX

00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:48.184
BILLION AS I SAID BUT- A GOOD

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:49.919
SHARE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:53.223
TO PLAN SO FAR OUT- IS BEING

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:57.694
LOST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT OPEN. TO

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:58.328
BOOK BUSINESS TODAY. SO I THINK

00:54:58.395 --> 00:54:59.396
THAT THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:02.032
SHOULD BE DISCUSSING IS AND

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.633
INSENSITIVE TO YOUR COMMENTS

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.903
CENTER PAM IS. THAT THE EVEN IF

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.238
THEY BALK BUSINESS THREE YEARS

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.073
OUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.042
INDUSTRY WON'T POSTPONE IT EVEN

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:14.110
WITH OUR OWN BOARD MEETINGS

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:15.278
WE'VE- GONE VIRTUAL WE POSTPONE

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.513
IN THE INDUSTRY IS VERY

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:19.182
FLEXIBLE AND RESILIENT- BUT I

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:20.583
THINK THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.585
KNOW THAT THERE IS A PLAN. YOU

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:23.787
KNOW TWO TO THREE YEARS OUT

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.388
THAT THEY'VE MARKED IT ON THE

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:30.694
BOOKS AND EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.562
AT LEAST THEY'RE OUT BEING ABLE

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:33.997
TO OPEN THE SALE THAT THAT

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:36.099
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:36.633
THAN ACTUALLY HOLDING THE

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.803
MEETING. AND THEN- OF COURSE

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.137

GOING TO BE A BIT OF AN

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.611
OVERVIEW BUT I'D LIKE EVERYONE

DECREASE 72% THIS YEAR. AN

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.917
OVERALL 67% FEWER INTERNATIONAL

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.120
RIVAL RIVALS WITH THE DROP FROM

CHINA NEARLY 73% AND 69% FOR

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:02.158
YOUR- TRADITIONALLY THE

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:03.192
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.327
ACCOUNTED FOR A MUCH LARGER

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:05.461
PERCENTAGE OF VISITORS SPENDING

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:06.429
AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.898
IMPORTANT SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:09.832
64% OF ALL OF OUR VISITORS

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:11.300
SPENDING COMES FROM

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:11.901
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS TO THE

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.203
CITY. BECAUSE RECOVERY WILL BE

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.272
pDRIVEN BY MAINLY BY DOMESTIC

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.874
TRAVELER VISITOR SPENDING WILL

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.175
TAKE LONGER TO RECOVER BECAUSE

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:20.276
DOMESTIC TRAVELERS TEND TO

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.677
SPEND LESS THAN INTERNATIONAL

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:22.278
TRAVELERS IN THE STATE'S

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:23.813
SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. SO

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.381
THAT'S GOING TO BE EVEN LONGER

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.350
FOR US TO RECOVER. THE LOST OF

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.751
THE CONVENTION BUSINESS IN SAN

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.486
FRANCISCO IS A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.088
THE DECLINE IN THE THING THAT

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.323
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. IN

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.224
TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN A

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.426

CONVENTION NIGHTS WERE BOOKED

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.595
AT HOTELS IN SAN FRANCISCO.

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:41.130
THIS YEAR WE EXPECT THE NUMBER

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.432
TO CLOSE OUT AT ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.734
AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND. WITH

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:45.301
MOST OF THOSE COMING IN THE

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.270
FIRST QUARTER. SO FAR FORTY

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.005
GROUPS HAVE CANCELED OFF THE

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.441
BOOKS AND TO TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.308
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TODAY WE GOT

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.676
FOUR MORE CANCELLATIONS FOR THE

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:56.712
FIRST SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.280
TWENTY ONE. CANCELLATION OF

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.514
CITY WIDE CONVENTIONS ALONE

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.551
REPRESENT A LOSS AND DIRECT-SPENDING OF OVER SIX HUNDRED

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.785
NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:04.720
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO ALONE.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:06.322
THE CITY IS DEVELOP PROTOCOLS

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.890
FOR FUTURE LARGE MEETINGS

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.725
SOCIAL DISTANCING ROLES ENHANCE

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.661
SANITATION REQUIREMENTS AND

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:13.129
EVERYTHING BECAUSE SAFETY IS

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.231
PARAMOUNT FOR EMPLOYEES INSISTS

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:16.399
SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT FOR

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.633
VISITORS SO WE DO NOT WANT TO

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.001
TAKE ANY STEPS. THAT WILL

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.704
ENSURE THE SAFETY- AS WE OPEN

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.139
UP THE CITY TO A FUTURE TRAVEL.

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.540
SAN FRANCISCO TRAVEL DOES NOT

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:25.975
ANTICIPATE NORMAL OPERATIONS TO

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.977
RETURN INTO A LEASE THEN LATER

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.946
PART OF NEXT YEAR. BUT ONLY

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.247
EFFECTS SEEN IN RAPID TESTING

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.015
IS READILY AVAILABLE. WE DON'T

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.383
ANTICIPATE THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.218
WE'LL SEE THE NUMBERS THAT WE

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.919
SAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINEEEN

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:39.422
UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.857
OR TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.959
I RESEARCH THAT- IT'S NOT JUST

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:43.993
SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S AFFECTED

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:44.994
BY THIS LACK OF MEETING

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.028
BUSINESS AND THE MEETING

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.730
BUSINESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR. FOR

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.465
TOURISM WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:50.666
LEISURE STARTING TO COME BACK

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:51.868
THAT'S TRUE IN A LOT OF

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.503
CALIFORNIANS OR SEEN LEISURE

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:54.337
TRAVEL. BUT IT'S MAINLY ON

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.639
WEEKENDS AND THE URBAN AREAS DO

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:57.940
NOT SEE THE SAME AND LEISURE.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.041
TRAVELERS AT SOME OF THE RESORT

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.210
AREA SEE SO WE NEED TO FIND

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:02.979
DEMAND DRIVERS TO BRING PEOPLE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.247
BACK INTO OUR CITIES AND BACK

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.681
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:06.716
MEETINGS IS ONE OF THE MOST

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.384
IMPORTANT LEISURE TRAVEL I MEAN

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.086
BEYOND MAJOR TRAVEL WE'D LOVE

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.855
TO HAVE A MEETING LIKE THIS IN

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:13.489
SAN FRANCISCO. WE CAN'T DO THAT

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.626
TODAY THIS AND AGAIN IT'S NOT

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:17.927
JUST SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S BEING

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.928
AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.029
BUSINESS MEETINGS. AND THE

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.364
BUSINESS NEED MEANING SECTORS

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.099
COLLAPSING ACROSS THE STATE.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.734
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. RULES WILL

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.801
NOT ALLOW A LARGE INDOOR

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.370
GATHERINGS DESPITE DISTANCING

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.704
SANITATION PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.740
PROVOKED PROVIDED. SUCCESSFUL

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:33.075
ELSEWHERE. IN PALM SPRINGS ON

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.210
MEETING HAVE BEEN LOST FOR THIS

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.511
YEAR AND THEY'RE BEGINNING TO

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:36.379
BE KANSEN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.247
OF NEXT YEAR. THE COACHELLA

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.582
VALLEY ALONE HAS LOST THREE

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.617
POINT ONE BILLION IN VISITOR

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:43.386
SPENDING SPENDING. MANY

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.153
PLANNERS CAN'T WAIT FOR

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.488
CALIFORNIA TO ISSUE GUIDANCE AT

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:46.689
VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE IS

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.025
ISSUED. THEY'RE MAKING PLANS TO

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:50.626
TAKE THEIR BUSINESS THEIR

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.227
DOLLARS ELSEWHERE THIS IS OUR

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:52.228
OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE-

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.462
WE WORK WITH A PLANNER WHO

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:54.530
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MEETING

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.299
HERE FOR THE FALL OF TWENTY

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.000
TWENTY ONE. THEY CAN'T FEEL

01:03:58.067 --> 01:03:59.202
THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE IT

01:03:59.268 --> 01:03:59.969
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.704
ESTABLISHED THOSE. PROTOCOLS

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.072
YET SO THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.074
OF MY TOP THREE THINGS TALKING

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:05.808
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.176
COMMUNICATING IN ADVANCE TO A

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:08.044
PLAN IS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.845
CONVENTIONS. ARE PLANNED YEARS

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.547
IN ADVANCE AND SO WE'RE GOING

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.449
TO BE OUT OF LUCK FOR THENEXT

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.750
RECOVERY TIME THE NEXT THREE OR

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:15.785
FOUR YEARS IF WE CAN'T START

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:18.287
BOOKING THOSE CONVENTIONS WITH

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:18.888
THE IDEA THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.123
TO COME BACK ONLINE. MANY

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.259
CRITICAL TO- CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.493
THE SMALL MEETINGS THAT WE

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.194
WOULD LIKE TO START WITH WE

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.562
REALIZE THAT THE ABILITY TO

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:27.863
LARGE. DO LARGE CITY WIDE

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:29.332
CONVENTIONS ARE LARGE EVENTS IS

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.167
NOT GONNA HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.235
WE DO FEEL THAT WE'RE IN A

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.736
POSITION THAT WE'RE READY TO

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:34.604

OTHER MEETING VENUES AND AROUND

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.408
THE STATE. WE CAN'T DO THAT AT

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.543
THIS POINT BUT THIS IS GONNA BE

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.644
ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT. BABY

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.312
STEPS. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:44.313
MEETINGS WE DO HAVE THE

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.815
PROTOCOLS IN PLACE WE FEEL THE

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:46.816
SAFETY IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:49.185
PARAMOUNT. BUT THAT IS THE NEXT

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.087
UP WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE HAPPEN.

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.456

AND FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.493
FROM LOCAL HOTEL TAXES IN THE

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.494
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ACROSS ALL

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:08.764
FUNDS. THAT 63% LESS TWO

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:09.999
HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION. THAT

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.967
WAS BUDGETED LAST FISCAL YEAR.

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.436
AGAIN THE SAME STORY IS PLAYING

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.104
OUT ACROSS THE STATE. IN

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.305
ANAHEIM WHERE TOURISM TAXES

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.606
MAKE UP ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.008
BUDGET. THE LOCKDOWN LAST

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.376
SPRING BECAUSE THE FIFTY FOUR

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.345
MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL 31%

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:24.380
AND HOTEL TAX COLLECTIONS. FOR

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.381
THE FISCAL YEAR THAT STARTED IN

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.949
JULY COLLECTIONS ARE PROJECTED

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.484
TO DROP ANOTHER THIRTY SEVEN

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.019
MILLION DOLLARS. TO EIGHTY

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:33.189
THREE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL 62%

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.523
DROP OF THE TWO FISCAL YEARS.

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:35.491
WITH STATE LINES FOR THEME PARK

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:36.992
RE OPENING AND THE RESUMPTION

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.361
OF BUSINESS MEETINGS FAR FROM

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:41.530
CERTAIN. RECOVERY RIGHT AWAY-

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:43.799
FOR SOME CITIES REMAINS ELUSIVE.

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.234
SO TOURISM IS EXTREMELY

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.169
CRITICAL COMPONENT FOR OUR-

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.838
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IT

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.005
GENERATES MILLIONS OF JOBS

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:52.108
BILLIONS IN TAXES BILLIONS OF

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:53.309
THE VISITOR SPENDING AND

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.077
ENHANCES OUR QUALITY OF LIFE.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.445
HOWEVER WITH THE CURRENT

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.780
SITUATION IT IS GOING TO BE A

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.281
VERY LONG VERY SLOW RECOVERY

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:00.316
THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO THE

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.951
COLLABORATION WE WORK TOGETHER

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.386
WITH OTHER DESTINATIONS ACROSS

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.788
CALIFORNIA TO BE DISTURBANCE.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:06.922
PROTOCOLS THAT ARE CONSISTENT

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:07.990
ACROSS THE STATE NOT

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:09.592
CONSISTENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.860
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER WE

01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:11.894
REALIZE IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.996
SLOW RECOVERY IT CAN BE DONE

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.331
BUT WE NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:17.533
STATE AND THE PATIENCE AND

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.167
SUPPORT OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS IN

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:20.703
ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN- THE

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:21.303
THREE THINGS THAT I WOULD GET

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.005
BACK TO YOUR QUESTION. ASSEMBLY

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:25.174
INTO THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:26.242
IS WHAT CAROLINE SAID IS

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.244
CONSISTENCY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:29.445
FOR A VISITOR BECAUSE THEY

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:30.446
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE JIG YOU

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:31.447
POLITICAL BOUNDARIES IN OUR

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:32.348
STATE THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.049
ACROSS IN A COUNTY BORDER CITY

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.985
ORDER. THE CONSISTENCY IN RULES

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.153
AND REGULATIONS WILL BE REALLY

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.655
IMPORTANT STATE BUDGET FACE A

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.123
MASK MANDATES ARE IMPORTANT

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.458
BECAUSE SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:43.659
MORE REQUIREMENTS THAN OTHER

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.060
COMMUNITIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:45.594
WE HAVE THE SORT OF

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.229
CONSISTENCY. BUT THE MOST

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:48.130
IMPORTANT THING I WOULD SAY

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.532
RIGHT NOW IS THE ABILITY TO

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:50.866
HAVE SMALL MEETINGS AS A DEMAND

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.235
DRIVERS- WE BELIEVE MUCH LIKE A

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.403
LOT OF OTHER BUSINESSES THAT

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.105
OPEN AT LIMITED CAPACITY WE CAN

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:57.339
OPEN OUR HOTELS IN A MEETING

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:58.841
VENUES TO SMALL MEETINGS.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.643
SAFELY AND WITH THE PROPER

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.344
SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND SANITATION

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.280
PROTOCOLS IN PLACE- AND I THINK

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:05.347
THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE NEXT

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.482
STEP THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:07.616
WE BELIEVE IT CAN BE DONE MUCH

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:08.884
LIKE CHURCHES HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:09.485
THEY CAN DO RESTAURANTS HAVE

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.352
SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DO.

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.287
THEATERS HAVE SHOWN THAT WE CAN

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.721
DO SO CAN WE AND MEETING

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:13.622
INDUSTRY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:08:13.689 --> 01:08:15.324
CRITICAL NEXT STEPS OF OUR

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:17.660
OPENING STRATEGY. SO I'M HERE

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:18.594
IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY OTHER

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:22.298
QUESTIONS. BUT THANK YOU FOR

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:23.065
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO.

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:26.869
THANK YOU I JUST STONE. I HAD

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.370
ONE THOUGHT I KNOW THAT THERE

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.439
ARE SOME GROUPS THAT ARE KIND

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.107
OF IN TRAIN IN WHAT WE CALL A

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:33.876
HYBRID MODEL WHERE THEY'RE

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.645
USING HOTEL SPACE CONFERENCE

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:37.379
ROOMS BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.249
ALLOWING- THEIR PARTS OF THE

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.218
GROUP THAT DON'T FEEL. THAT

01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:44.653
THEY'RE READY TO DO THAT TO

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.890
KIND OF ZOO MAN- HAVE IF YOU

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.791
SEE ANY OF THAT STARTING TO

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.626
HAPPEN WE CERTAINLY HAVE A

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:51.927
PLANNER SO WE'RE TALKING A LOT

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.329
TO THEM ABOUT THAT EVEN IN THE

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.497
LARGER CONVENTIONS THAT WOULD

01:08:54.563 --> 01:08:55.965
HAVE A MOSCONI CENTER OF HAVING

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.833
A HYBRID VIRTUAL AND IN PERSON

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.235
MEETING WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.469
GOING TO BE THE FIRST STEP IN

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:01.837
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:02.872
WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:03.939
IS AS IS THE INDUSTRY WE'RE

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.608
MAKING. TAKEN STEPS TO MAKE

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:06.775
THAT HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:07.743
NOT GOING TO ALL THIS AND BE

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.078
ABLE TO OPEN TO LARGE MEETINGS

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.579
INSTANTLY SO WE BELIEVE THIS

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.047
HYBRID APPROACH IS THE WAY TO

01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:14.250
EASE INTO IT TO SHOWCASE HOW WE

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.751
CAN DO I MEAN SAFETY SAFELY AND

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.319
ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE A

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.320
LOT OF OUR MEETINGS AND SEVEN

01:09:19.722 --> 01:09:21.423
ARCHITECT MEETINGS AND THE

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.892
MEDICAL MEETINGS ARE PRIMARILY

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:23.792
MADE UP OF DOCTORS WHO

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:24.894
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.295
SAFETY PROTOCOLS. RIGHT NOW

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:28.130
THEY CAN'T EVEN ME AND SO WE

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.398
BELIEVE THAT THIS NEXT UP A

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:30.099
HYBRID MEETING WITH PART

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:34.136

THE GOLD SEAL STANDARD WHICH

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:23.492
BASICALLY MAKES IT SO THAT

PEOPLE FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:27.496

RENTAL CAR. THAT HAS BEEN

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:31.533
CLEANED. YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.068
THROUGH THE PROCESS FROM THE

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.703
TIME THAT THE CAR RETURNS AND

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.471
THEN EVEN WHEN THE LAST PERSON

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.607
THE PARKS THE CAR LEAVES- AND

CUSTOMER. OUR COMPETITORS ALL

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:49.451
TOOK SIMILAR ACTION SO THIS

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.354
WASN'T JUST- WITHIN HERDS- BUT

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.121
IT ONE TRAVEL STOP IN THE EARLY

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:56.558
SPRING- WE WERE REALLY HIT WITH

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.393
A DOUBLE WHAMMY. I MEAN. NUMBER

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.495
ONE AIR TRAVEL IS HUGE FOR OUR

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:03.231
BUSINESS I MEAN. IT'S NO

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:05.267
MYSTERY THAT. YOU KNOW MOST OF

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.434
THE BUSINESS AT THE AIRPORT

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.836
RAIL CARS COMPANIES BECAUSE

THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOCATED IS

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.840
FROM PASSENGERSTHAT ARE

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.742
DEPARTING. DEPARTING AIRPLANES.

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:15.810
SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND 80%

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.679
OF THE FLIGHTS ROUGHLY. STOP

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.948
FLYING IN. NOT ONLY DID WE

01:20:20.015 --> 01:20:23.285
HAVE. THE CHALLENGE OF NOT

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.986
HAVING REVENUE IN THE CARS

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.922
GOING BACK OUT BUT EVERYBODY

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.523
WAS RETURNING THEIR VEHICLES.

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:31.293
AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST IN

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.461
CALIFORNIA. WE HAD SIXTY SIX

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:34.262
THOUSAND CARS THAT WE NEEDED TO

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.964
FIND A PLACE TO PARK IN OUR

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.433
FACILITIES WE USUALLY RUN ABOUT

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.602
8290% UTILIZATION SO. WE DON'T

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.604
HAVE THE PROPERTY FOR THAT SO

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.905
UNDER THE SCRAMBLE WE CREATE A

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.707
LOT OF LEASES WITH PROPERTIES

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:46.808
ALL OF THIS IS THAT ADDITIONAL

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:49.277
COST SO. NOW REVENUES NOT

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.513
FLOWING IN. AND WE HAVE A COST

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.215
BURDEN THAT WE HAVE NEVER

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:55.417
ANTICIPATED- THAT WAS IN THE

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:58.386
MILLIONS. NOT TO MENTION THAT

01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.088
THE LACK OF TRAVEL AND REVENUE

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:01.890
FOR THE SECOND QUARTER FOR US

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:04.726
AND PUBLICLY- DOUBLED IT WAS

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.128
THAT WE WHAT WE SUFFERED A LOSS

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:10.365
OF 82% AND TOTAL REVENUE.

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:13.034
MEANWHILE YOU KNOW OUR OUR

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:16.504
LEASES STILL CAME DO. THE

01:21:16.571 --> 01:21:17.872
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO THE

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:19.174
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS THAT HAS

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.109
BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:21.643

INDUSTRY YOU KNOW HAS MADE A

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.336
SLOW RECOVERY SINCE THE APRIL

BEEN AIDED SOMEWHAT BY OUR

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:55.377
LOCAL TRAFFIC- IN THE SUMMER

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.145
DEMAND FOR ROAD TRIPS A LOT OF

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.380
OUR BUSINESS TODAY THAT IS

01:21:58.446 --> 01:21:59.748

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:16.965
I MENTION THE WE'VE BEEN AROUND

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:19.367

THE TOUGHEST DECISION. WAS THE

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:26.741
ONE THAT IMPACTED THE

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.309

IN MAY. AFTER AFTER A HUNDRED

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:35.350
TWO YEARS. WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:37.585
TO REDUCE THE LABOR. IN

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:40.689

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:42.457
INITIALLY WITH A MIX OF

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:44.259
FURLOUGHS AND THEN REALLY

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.961
TURNED INTO- LAYOFFS. CURRENTLY

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:48.229
IN CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE

01:25:13.908 --> 01:25:15.143
HELP THE STATE TREASURY. AND

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.411
HELP TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:18.112
ADEQUATE FUNDING TO VISIT

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:20.248
CALIFORNIA. SO THOSE ARE TWO

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:21.916
THINGS SPECIFIC TO OUR INDUSTRY

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.051
THE PROBABLY THE THIRD AND I

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.586
THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT.

01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:26.221
OVERALL IS A SIMILAR MESSAGE

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:27.956
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY TODAY

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.357
AND THAT'S THE CONSISTENCY IN

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:30.291
THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:32.560
MESSAGING. AND WHAT PEOPLE CAN

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:34.929
AND CANNOT DO AND WHAT THE WHAT

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:37.098
THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.100
THE CURRENT SITUATION IS TODAY-

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.568
FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW IF

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:41.769
SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THEY WANT

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:42.704
TO TAKE A ROAD TRIP TO GO

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:45.640
CAMPING IT'S VERY UNCLEAR.

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.976
WHERE THEY CAN GO. THERE THEIR

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:49.544
CAMPING IS AVAILABLE IN SOME

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.079
COUNTIES AND THEN YOU GO ACROSS

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:52.780
TO ANOTHER AND IT'S NOT WITHIN

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.182
EVEN THOSE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.885
MAYBE A STATE PARK THAT HAVE

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:58.019
CAMPGROUNDS MAY BE CLOSED. WELL

01:25:58.086 --> 01:25:59.387
JUST DON'T KNOW AND SO A LOT OF

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.289
TIMES YOU'RE JUST GOING OUT AND

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:02.423
DEALING WITH WHATEVER THEY HAVE

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.125
TO DEAL WITH. BUT IT'S VERY

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.927
DIFFICULT. FOR PEOPLE TO WANT

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:06.728
TO TAKE THOSE TRIPS IF THEY

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:08.463
DON'T. HAVE THE CERTAINTY OF

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:09.731
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:12.000
FACE WHEN WE'RE OUT THERE.

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.835
YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE. OR YOU

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:14.836
MAY NOT BE AWARE WITH THE

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:17.205
RENTAL CAR INDUSTRYPROVIDES.

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:17.805
THERE'S A CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.374
REVENUE SEGMENT. THROUGH THE

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.511
ASSESSMENTS WRITTEN IN THE BY

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.546
DECLINE IN THE REVENUE THIS

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:26.014
DRASTIC IT'S A SERIOUS BLOW TO

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.248
OUR BUDGET WHICH HELPS TO

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:28.683
PROVIDE FOR THE MARKETING IN

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:29.884
AWARENESS DELIVERED THROUGH

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.619
VISIT CALIFORNIA. THAT IS

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.421
PROVEN TO BE SO VITAL IN THE

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:37.292
PAST FOR US. WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.027

COMMITMENT. TO ENSURE THAT WHEN

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.534
PEOPLE GET OFF THE AIRPLANE

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.303
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET TO

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:48.870
THEIR DESTINATIONS IN A SAFE

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.672
WAY. AND THAT'S REALLY THE

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.507
MESSAGE I WANTED TO GET ACROSS.

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:54.876
SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.978
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND I'M

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:57.579
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:26:57.645 --> 01:27:00.782
YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.684
HARVEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM

DO YOU HAVE ANY REMARKS OR

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.288
QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE- THIS.

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:09.090
I'M JUST GLAD TO BE HERE- TO BE

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.692
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:12.226
IMPORTANT TOPIC I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.762
BEING LATE TO I ACTUALLY HAVE

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:16.464
PROBABLY UP MORE THAN THE

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:18.199
AVERAGE BEAR UP AND TRAVELING

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:21.235
GOOD- ON- ON AIRPLANES ON A

01:27:21.302 --> 01:27:22.804
REGULAR BASIS AND I HAVE TO SAY

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:26.474
THAT- IT'S MOSTLY SOUTHWEST AND

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.009
IT'S- EVERY FLIGHT HAS BEEN ON

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:31.646
TIME- AND GREAT THERE'S ALWAYS

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:32.213
BEEN A MIDDLE SEAT AVAILABLE

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.649
AND- A GREAT COMPLIANCE WITH-

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:35.850
MASKING RICK MASKING

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.219
REQUIREMENTS IN A- I THINK A-

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:40.888
FAIR AMOUNT OF COMFORT. TO

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:42.223
AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:43.391
AND THEN OVER THE WEEKEND I HAD

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.892
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RENT A CAR

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.794
AND I HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:48.896
WITH ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS TO

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.698
ENSURE VERY SIMILAR TO- OF THE

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.367
SERVICE THAT THAT HURTS IS

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:56.170
PROVIDING AND I. THINK GOING

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:59.207
FORWARD THAT. THAT OF US

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:01.542
STELLAR SERVICE I SHOULD SAY

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:02.710
THIS WAS THE FIRST FLIGHT ON

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.711
SOUTHWEST THAT ACTUALLY GOT

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:04.579
CANCELED BECAUSE IT WAS A

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.847
MECHANICAL PROBLEM AND THAT'S

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:07.815
WHY I. WAS LATE I HAD TO SWITCH

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:10.418
OVER. TO ANOTHER FLIGHT BUT I

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:13.287
THINK THAT THAT HIGH LEVEL OF

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:16.324
SERVICE. THAT PROVIDES A LEVEL

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:20.628
OF COMFORT- FOR- PATRONS OF

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:23.631
THE- OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:24.198
AND PARTICULARLY THE HIGH.

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.800
COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE KEY TO

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.835
COMING BACK- AS QUICKLY AS

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:30.938
POSSIBLE FROM THE- PANDEMIC AND

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:32.740
TO BEING ABLE TO. BEGIN TO

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.443
OFFSET THE TERRIBLE ECONOMIC-

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.045
COSTS THAT WE'VE WE'VE

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:40.415
SUFFERED- AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:43.384
THAT- THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.420
KEY TO. A DOMESTIC TRAVEL AND A

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:48.356
RETURN TO NORMALCY- AND DOUBLY

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.323
CERTAIN THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:51.459
TRUE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:54.295
IN. BOTH OF THESE ARE- OF

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:57.865
FUNDAMENTALS FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:28:57.932 --> 01:29:00.568
ECONOMY AND TO IN PARTICULAR

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:03.104
THE ECONOMY OF A LOT OF FUN- OF

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.739
THOSE WHO ARE SITTING HERE ON

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.374
THE- ON THE DICE TODAY AND

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.076
PARTICIPATE IN THIS IN THIS

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:11.679
COMMITTEE. I DID HAVE- BUT

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.681
WANTED TO ASK- CUT YOU MISTER

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.316
HARVEY ONE NOT A FOR ONE

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:16.951
CLARIFICATION I MAY HAVE MISSED

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.954
IT BUT- THE ISSUE WITH THE

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.390
CAMPGROUNDS WHAT IS THAT- HAT

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.992
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SPECIFICALLY

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.461
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. DID THE

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:29.964
SOME TYPE OF A WAY FOR. PEOPLE

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:30.765
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:33.234
HAPPENING BETWEEN THE COUNTIES

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.269
WITHOUT HAVING TO YOU KNOW CALL

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:37.338
EACH COUNTY AHEAD OF TIME READ

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.639
THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS THAT WILL

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.841
TELL THEM WHAT THE RULES AND

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:41.375
REGULATIONS ARE. I MEAN IT

01:29:41.442 --> 01:29:42.310
REALLY COULD IT STARTS WITH

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.711
CONSISTENCY IF THERE WASN'T

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:46.180
STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY. THEN

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.348
THAT WOULD BE EASY RIGHT

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:50.852
BECAUSE THEN- EVERYBODY WOULD

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.086
KNOW PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S GOING

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:53.521
ON EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT WE HAVE

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:55.456
THE INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN THE

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:58.626
COUNTIES. WE KNOW THAT WITH THE

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.294
COUNTY IS BEING ABLE. TO BE.

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.796
WHETHER OR NOT IT INTO WHAT

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:03.531
PACE THEY'RE GOING TO OPEN THAT

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.600
CAUSES A LOT OF CONFUSION SO IF

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.968
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT IF IT

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:08.002
WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.271
INCONSISTENT BY BY COUNTIES.

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:13.107
SOME WAY THAT EACH COUNTY HAS A

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:15.009
STANDARD YOU KNOW SOME TYPE OF

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.911
A STANDARD VIEW DOCUMENT THAT

01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:18.679
SAYS WHAT THE STATUS OF THE-

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:20.648
COUNTY IS IN WHAT IS AND WHAT

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:22.750
IS NOT. AVAILABLE TO DO WITHOUT

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.185
REALLY HAVING TO READ THROUGH

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:27.321
YOU KNOW THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS TO

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:27.922
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LAST

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:31.159
ORDER. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:31.993
GIVE THAT SOME THOUGHT. AT I

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.694
THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:36.564
ON THE CONSISTENCY THAT- FOR

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.199
EXAMPLE MASK YOU HAVE SOME

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.268
CITIES THAT MADE A MASK

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.436
ORDINANCE SOME COUNTIES THAT

01:30:42.503 --> 01:30:44.238
HAVE MADE AMOUNT MASSPORT ANTS

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:47.074
OR ARE NOT IN ALLIANCE EVEN

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:49.744
WITH. THE CITY IN THEIR AREA

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:52.747
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE STATE SO

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:54.949
IT IS VERY CONFUSING. FOR

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.884
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE AND

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.586
ICE I THINK THAT WORD THAT

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:00.354
KEEPS COMING UP CONSISTENCY

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:03.591
WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR- MANY

01:31:03.658 --> 01:31:04.992
PEOPLE JUST TO KNOW WHEN I'M

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:08.029
OUT I'M DOING THIS OR SO FORTH

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.430
YEAH MADAM CHAIR EVEN FOR AN

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:10.898
EXAMPLE THAT YOU JUST THAT THE

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.500
DAY YOU REALLY MADE ME THINK OF

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.035
IS THAT YOU KNOW ONE WEEK WHEN

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.570
HE CAME OUT AS A COMPANY WITH.

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:17.805
A NATIONAL MASS POLICY FOR OUR

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.372
CUSTOMERS AND OUR OUR

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:21.108
EMPLOYEES- PART OF WHAT WAS

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.210
DRIVING THAT OF COURSE SAFETY

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:24.745
IS A BIG FACTOR OF IT BUT ALSO

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.848
BECAUSE SOME STATES REQUIRED IN

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:28.616
SOME STATES DON'T REQUIRE IT.

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:29.951
OUR EMPLOYEES WERE HAVING A

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:31.219
DIFFICULT TIME ENFORCING IT

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.187
BECAUSE THE TRAVELERS DIDN'T

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.689
KNOW WHERE THEY WERE GOING WHAT

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.023
WAS WHAT WAS THE EXPECTATION

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.859
THERE. SOMEONE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:40.394
PUT A BLANKET STATEMENT ON OUR

01:31:40.461 --> 01:31:42.530
COMPANY WEBSITE THAT SHOWED OR

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.098
FROM THE PHONE OR WHAT HAVE YOU

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.566
RESERVE YOUR CAR THAT SAID.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.535
THIS IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:48.069
IT HURTS THIS IS WHAT OUR

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.705
POLICY IS THAT GREATLY REDUCED

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:51.839
OUR EMPLOYEES WERE VERY

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:52.874
THANKFUL THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.141
TO DEAL WITH THOSE SITUATIONS

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:55.810
BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE WERE

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:59.814
COMPLIANT BECAUSE. THEY KNEW

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:00.348
WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:04.452
AHEAD OF TIME. SENATE PAN.

MAY. BE HAPPENING THE COUNTY

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.471

ANYTIME SOON ARE WE GOING TO

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:19.487

GOVERNMENT OR THE WORK TO WHERE

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:23.157
THE STATE POLICY. OVER RULES

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.492
THE COUNTY POLICY TO WHERE

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:25.760
EVERYBODY'S DOING THE SAME

01:34:25.826 --> 01:34:27.428
THING IF THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.964
A CONSIDER MAYBE HAVE LIKE THAT

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:32.666
THE TOP TEN THINGS THAT PEOPLE

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:33.234
ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY'RE

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.903
GOING. ON A ROAD TRIP- ON A

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:36.804
TRAVELING TRIP OR WHATEVER

01:34:36.871 --> 01:34:38.172
THEY'RE GOING TO GO. WHETHER

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:41.242
IT'S- THE STATUS OF THE HOTELS

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:42.610
THE STATUS OF THE RESTAURANTS

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.478
WHETHER OR NOT IF THEY'RE ABLE

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:45.112
TO HAVE INDOOR DINING OR

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.981
OUTDOOR DINING. THAT A

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.582
CHECKLIST WILL ACT CAMPING TO

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:49.817
THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:50.551
BECAUSE I BROUGHT THAT UP

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.053
EARLIER. THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:53.287
SOME TYPE OF A STANDARD

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.356
DOCUMENT WERE OR PLACE THAT YOU

01:34:55.423 --> 01:34:57.425
COULD GO AND JUST LOOK AT. EACH

01:34:57.491 --> 01:35:01.195
COUNTIES- EACH COUNTIES CURRENT

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:02.463
GUIDELINES AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.864
WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWING THAT

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:04.665
WOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:06.534
PEOPLE TO SEE. YOU KNOW ONE

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.335

LOOKING TO DO X. Y. NZ AND ALSO

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:14.308
WHERE NOT TO GO. SO IF PEOPLE

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:14.909
DON'T END UP CHAU UP THERE.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:15.743
THAT AND THEN FOR OUT LATER

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:16.944
WELL WE MADE THIS TRIP FOR

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.813
NOTHING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ABLE

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:19.380
TO DO THAT'S WHERE AS IF. WE

01:35:19.447 --> 01:35:21.282

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.886
FRIENDLY. OKAY SO IT MIGHT BE.

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:28.089
WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS THAT

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:29.690
TRYING TO IN A FIVE WHAT ARE

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:32.460
THE- ITEMS. THAT THE TOURISM

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.694

PEOPLE CAN LOOK IT UP AND

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.210

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:33.345
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT TALKING

ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S THEME PARKS.

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:37.416
THESE ICONIC PARKS ARE A

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:38.250

IS FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:05.044
VIBRANT THEME PARKS. AND THEY

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.712
ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS

02:03:06.779 --> 02:03:09.949
OF CALIFORNIA'S FORMERLY

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:11.250
VIBRANT TOURISM INDUSTRY. AND I

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:12.718
KNOW THE SEGMENT IS ABOUT HOW

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:14.220
CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM INDUSTRY

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:16.055
CAN RECOVER BUT I THINK WE ARE

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:18.624
UNIQUE BECAUSE WE ARE. CLOSED

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:20.126
SO ARE MESSAGES THAT THE FIRST

02:03:20.192 --> 02:03:21.627
STEP FOR GETTING AMUSEMENT

02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:23.729
PARKS OUT OF THIS HOLE. IS TO

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:25.865
STOP DIGGING. FOR EACH DAY THAT

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:27.166

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:28.901
DON'T HAVE A PATHWAY TOWARD

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:30.736
RESPONSIBLE RE OPENING ON A

02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:33.873
REALISTIC TIMELINE. THAT HOLE

02:03:33.939 --> 02:03:36.575
GETS DEEPER. AND JUST A BIT

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:38.377
ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS ALL

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:40.713
EVOLVED BACK IN MARCH. THANKS

UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVE SITUATION

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.723
OF COCA NINETEEN AND WE WANTED

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:51.791

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:53.859
COLLABORATIVE WAY. ARE YOU

LOOKING FORWARD TO A DAY THAT

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:57.530
WE COULD REOPEN. DURING THOSE

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:58.631
SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE DEVELOPED

02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:01.033
COMPREHENSIVE PLANS THAT

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:03.102
CONSIST OF REDUCE CAPACITY

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.804
RIGOROUS SANITATION PROCEDURES

02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:06.205
EMPLOYED PROTOCOLS AND TRAINING

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:08.207
GUESTS PROTOCOLS FACE COVERING

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:08.974
REQUIREMENTS PHYSICAL

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:10.876
DISTANCING. AND OVER THE SEVEN

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:11.944
MONTHS THEY'VE REFINED OF THOSE

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:14.713
PLANS IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:17.082
TO REOPEN IN A SAFE AND

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.517
RESPONSIBLE MANNER AS SOON AS

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:20.452
WERE GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT. AND

02:04:20.519 --> 02:04:21.854
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:24.223
HIGHLIGHT WHAT MAKES PARKS

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:27.059
UNIQUE- WHEN YOU GO TO VISIT A

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:29.862
PARK. YOU SEE THE MAGIC YOU SEE

02:04:29.929 --> 02:04:31.797
THE FUN THAT'S KIND OF THE

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.299
MYSTIQUE OF THESE PARKS THAT'S

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:37.336
THEIR GOALS FOR YOU TO YOU KNOW

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:37.903
FORGET YOUR WORRIES AND HAVE

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.371
FUN. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:41.407
BEHIND THE SCENES SO YOU KNOW

02:04:41.473 --> 02:04:42.842
THESE ARE PRIMARILY OUTDOOR

02:04:42.908 --> 02:04:45.211
LOCATIONS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:47.179
OPEN SPACE. THEY'RE NOT

02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:48.180
TYPICALLY INTENDED FOR

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:50.149
CONGREGATING OR MIXING IT'S A

02:04:50.216 --> 02:04:51.784
PLACE WHERE A FAMILY WILL GO TO

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:53.819
ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. AND

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:55.187
NOT HUDDLE UP WITH WITH

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:57.590
STRANGERS. THERE CONTROLLED

02:04:57.656 --> 02:04:59.291
ENVIRONMENTS UNLIKE MANY OTHER

02:04:59.358 --> 02:05:01.594
ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE ALREADY

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.195
BEING ALLOWED IN THE STATE.

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:05.297
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE YOU CAN'T

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:07.266
ENFORCE MASKING PHYSICAL

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:08.934
DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS.

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:11.070
ADDITIONALLY GAS OF THEME PARKS

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:13.205
ARE USED TO THIS THEY KNOW THAT

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.840
WHEN THEY GO TO A PARK. THEY'RE

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:15.875
GONNA BE EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR

02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:19.645
BEHAVIOR SO THERE THERE ARE

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:20.880
PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HOW. AN

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:23.115
INDUSTRY CAN ENCOURAGE THE

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:25.184
BEHAVIOR THAT WE NEED TO SEE TO

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:27.319
CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE PANDEMIC.

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:28.721
A PARKS ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF

02:05:28.787 --> 02:05:30.623
ME MOVING PEOPLE IT'S NOT

02:05:30.689 --> 02:05:32.358
STATIC THE CONTROL THE CAPACITY

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:35.327
ON A REGULAR BASIS- EVEN PRE

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.096
COATED. AND THEY PLACE A HIGH

02:05:37.162 --> 02:05:38.397
VALUE ON GUEST AND EMPLOYEE

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:42.801
SATISFACTION- PARKS KNOW THAT

02:05:42.868 --> 02:05:45.404
THEY NEED A HEALTHY WORKFORCE.

02:05:45.471 --> 02:05:46.772
AND THAT THEY NEED CONSUMER

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:48.841
CONFIDENCE THESE ARE CRITICAL

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:50.876
IN THE LONG TERM IT DOES NOBODY

02:05:50.943 --> 02:05:53.345
ANY GOOD TO RE OPEN PREMATURELY

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:55.547
IN AN UNSAFE WAY. WE KNOW THAT

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:56.582
WE'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR RE

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:59.752
OPENING AND WE THINK THE TIME

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:02.288
IS GETTING CLOSE I WON'T GO

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:04.556
TOO. DEEP INTO THE IMPACTS ARE

02:06:04.623 --> 02:06:05.024
HEARING IT FROM OTHER

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:07.059
INDUSTRIES BUT YOU KNOW TENS OF

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.093
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.828
LAID OFF AND FURLOUGHED. THESE

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:11.497
PEOPLE ARE READY TO GET BACK TO

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:13.832
WORK- ON THE- INDUSTRY SIDE

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.567
WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:16.669
LOSING THAT TELL US

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:18.704
PERMANENTLY. AND BEYOND THE

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:20.706
PARKS YOU'VE GOT COMMUNITIES

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.541
AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:24.510
DEPEND ON THE THEME PARK

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:27.212
INDUSTRY. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:29.148
TO WHO RELY ON THOSE TAX

02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:34.186
DOLLARS. AND I THINK. AS WE AS

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:38.324
WE EXPLORE RE OPENING WE

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.891
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO KEEP THAT

02:06:38.958 --> 02:06:41.360
HELL AND FIGHTING THE PAN TOP

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:43.295
OF MIND AND OUR MAIN MESSAGE

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:46.298
FOR YOU IS THAT RESPONSIBLY

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:47.266
REOPEN CALIFORNIA'S AMUSEMENT

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:50.069
PARKS AND A STUBBORN COMMITMENT

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:52.438
TO FIGHTING COATED AND TAKING A

02:06:52.504 --> 02:06:54.940
SCIENCE AND DATA AND HEALTH

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:56.241
FIRST APPROACH. THESE ARE NOT

02:06:56.308 --> 02:06:58.744
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THINGS YOU

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:01.513
CANNOT DO BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY.

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:03.582
AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OTHER

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:05.417
STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.519
THAT ARE SHOWING THAT PARKS ARE

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:09.154
RE OPENING SO YOU KNOW MANY OF

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:10.856
OUR PARKS HAVE FACILITIES.

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:12.858
OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.560
MANY CASES THERE CALIFORNIA

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:16.328
PARK IS THE ONLY PART THAT'S

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:18.163
NOT REOPENED. THROUGHOUT THE

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:20.232
WORLD AND WE'RE NOT SEEN THESE

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:22.201
OUTBREAKS OF COVERT BEING

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:23.969
TRACED BACK TO PARKS. ARE THERE

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:25.204
IS A RECENT NEW YORK TIMES

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:27.172
ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT AND IT

02:07:27.239 --> 02:07:29.241
HIGHLIGHTED THAT. THE WORST

02:07:29.308 --> 02:07:30.776
CASE SCENARIO THE PEOPLE FEAR

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.578
TO DISNEY WORLD. JUST ISN'T

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:35.547
PLAYING OUT AND THEY SITE THAT

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.383
HEALTH OFFICIALS AS WELL AS AN

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:39.752
AS WORKER UNIONS. ARE CITING

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.320
THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT ARE

02:07:41.387 --> 02:07:43.822
IN PLACE AS RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:45.724
KEEPING THE VIRUS THAT DAY.

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.226
HERE IN THE STATE WE'VE GOT THE

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:49.261
ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH AGENCY

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:52.097
THAT IS RECOMMENDING. THAT THE

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:53.098
PARTS OF THE RE OPENING TIER

02:07:53.165 --> 02:07:55.034
THREE. SO THERE ARE MANY

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:56.769
EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:59.671
SHOWING THAT THESE PARKS CAN WE

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:03.842
OPEN IN A SAFE WAY. SO WHERE

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.911
ARE WE NOW AGAIN OUR FIRST STEP

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:08.080
IS TO PLOT OUT RESPONSIBLE AND

02:08:08.147 --> 02:08:09.815
REASONABLE RE OPENING PLANNED

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:10.382
FOR THE PARKS WE DESPERATELY

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:13.252
NEED THAT- I'M SURE THAT YOU

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:14.887
KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN READING

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.688
THE PRESS IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:19.024
PRETTY PRETTY WELL AND THAT THE

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.492
GOVERNOR I NOW SENDING AND

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:22.127
TEAMS OF FOLKS OUT TO THE VISIT

02:08:22.194 --> 02:08:23.962
THE PARKS CURRENTLY WE'RE

02:08:24.029 --> 02:08:25.664
EXTREMELY ENCOURAGED BY THIS

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:28.434
PARKS ARE COMPLEX AND YOU'VE

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.369
GOT TO SEE IT FIRST HAND TO

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:32.237
KNOW EXACTLY HOW THESE

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:34.706
EXTENSIVE PLANS ARE BEING

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.775
IMPLEMENTED IN IN REAL IN REAL

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:39.445
TIME.AND IT I THINK IT'S

02:08:39.511 --> 02:08:40.612
REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:43.782
WHENPARKS REOPENED IT'S GOING

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:45.417
TO LOOK DRAFT DIFFERENT THAN IT

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:47.019
DID BEFORE COPELAND IT'S NOT

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:49.221
GOING TO GO BACK TO PRE CODED

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:52.458
YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THEY- GIVE

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:53.459
US THE GREEN LIGHT. SO TO

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:55.227
ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THIS

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:58.363
QUESTION- CAN'T LIMIT TO THREE

02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:02.034
SORRY. SO I THINK THEY'RE FIVE

02:09:02.101 --> 02:09:02.568
THINGS REALLY THAT THAT WE

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:04.136
NEED. FIRST OF ALL WE'RE

02:09:04.203 --> 02:09:06.105
LOOKING FOR FAIRNESS AGAIN I'M

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:07.706
UPPER REPRESENTING AT AN

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:09.508
INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.076
FOR SEVEN MONTHS. WE LOOK AT

02:09:11.143 --> 02:09:13.112
SIMILARLY SITUATED INDUSTRIES

02:09:13.178 --> 02:09:13.979
THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO

02:09:14.046 --> 02:09:17.015
REOPEN. WE SEE OTHER INDUSTRIES

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:18.984
THAT ARE NOT SIMILAR SIMILARLY

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:20.819
SITUATED BUT- ACTUALLY POSSIBLY

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:22.754
RISKIER THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED

02:09:22.821 --> 02:09:24.356
TO REOPEN SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:27.259
SOME FAIRNESS AND TREATMENT-

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:29.428
WITHIN THE BLUEPRINT. OF A

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:31.930
REASONABLE TIME. WAITING UNTIL

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:34.199
TIER FOUR TO RE OPEN PARKS WILL

02:09:34.266 --> 02:09:36.235
DECIMATE THE INDUSTRY I CANNOT

02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:37.102
I CANNOT STATE THAT MORE

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:40.372
CLEARLY- THERE ARE NO CONSIST

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:41.640
PROJECTIONS ABOUT WHEN THESE

02:09:41.707 --> 02:09:44.109
COUNTIES WITHIN PARKS WOULD HIT

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:46.578
TIER FOUR WERE WORRIED ABOUT.

02:09:46.645 --> 02:09:51.483
THE TIER FOUR METRICS- ONE CASE

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:52.618
FOR WHY HUNDRED RESIDENTS AND

02:09:52.684 --> 02:09:53.685
SOME OF THESE COUNTIES FALL SO

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:55.154
POSITIVE THE LOAN COULD PUSH

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.156
THEM OF THAT SO WE DON'T SEE

02:09:57.222 --> 02:09:58.690
TIER FOUR AS AS A RE OPENING

02:09:58.757 --> 02:10:00.792
PLAN WE SEE IT AS A IT WOULD BE

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:02.928
A WAY TO KEEP PARKS CLOSED

02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:05.998
INDEFINITELY. NUMBER THREE. WE

02:10:06.064 --> 02:10:07.799
NEED REASONABLE GUIDELINES WE

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.368
NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT ANY

02:10:09.434 --> 02:10:10.936
CAPACITY OR GEOGRAPHIC

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:13.472
LIMITATIONS MAKE SENSE. THAT

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:15.774
THERE FEASIBLE AND PRACTICAL.

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:18.177
AT FOURTH WE NEED AN ITERATIVE

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:21.146
AND COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND I

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:21.780
AM HOPING THAT WE'RE MOVING IN

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:24.082
THAT DIRECTION. WE HAVE WORLD

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:26.418
WIDE EXPERIENCE AND WE'VE GOT

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:28.487

DRAW FROM. WE WELCOME

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.423

NEVER A PERFECT. SITUATION IN

02:10:39.731 --> 02:10:40.232
ANY REGARD RIGHT BUT WORKING

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:40.799
TOGETHER CAN ALWAYS MAKE IT

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:41.934
BETTER AND WE WILL EAGER TO DO

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.437
THAT. AND THE FIFTH ONE IS. A

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.939

THAT THESE ARE COMPLEX. THEY'RE

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:56.548
LIKE LITTLE CITIES AND- THE

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.616
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARKS

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:59.051

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:26.664
AND THEN IT TALKS ABOUT THE

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:28.633
ARRIVAL IN THE TRAINING AND

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:30.034
EVEN THINGS LIKE AT FIRST WHEN

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:31.536
WE WERE. WHEN WE ARE TAKING THE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:32.804
TEMPERATURE OF OUR PLACES THEY

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:34.872
WERE TOUGH. AS THEY WERE-

02:23:34.939 --> 02:23:36.040
COMING YOU WOULD SAY OKAY WELL

02:23:36.107 --> 02:23:36.874
YOU KNOW THEY GET OUT OF THE

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:40.111

POLLING IN. CAR AND SET UP A

02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:44.182
CHECK SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE

02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:44.716
THEIR TEMPERATURES AS THEY

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.217
PULLED IN ONE. BECAUSE IT

02:23:46.284 --> 02:23:47.952
PREVENTED OTHER TOUCH POINTS

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:48.886
FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE CAR

02:23:48.953 --> 02:23:50.588

02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:54.425
GUIDANCE OUT FURTHER. AND THEN

02:23:54.492 --> 02:23:55.526
YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING IN

02:23:55.593 --> 02:23:57.195

WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR MINDSET.

02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:27.211
TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE BECAUSE

EVERYTHING WE DO IN OUR

NOT GOOD AND WE CHECK IN ON AN

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:38.089
HOURLY BASIS AND IF WE KNOW

02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:40.158
THAT WE'VE GOT SOMETHING NOT

02:26:40.224 --> 02:26:41.058
MIXING WILL CHANGE OF TEAM WILL

02:26:41.125 --> 02:26:42.293
FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:43.961
GET THAT THROUGH PUT DONE. IN

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:46.330
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POST

02:26:46.397 --> 02:26:47.365
COMMENT. WE TOOK THOSE SINGLE

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:48.399
RIDER LINES THAT WE USED TO DO

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:52.170
TO FILL AN EMPTY SPOT. ON ANY

02:26:52.236 --> 02:26:54.572
TO LINE THAT CAME TOO CLOSE.

02:26:54.639 --> 02:26:55.907
AND WENT INTO THAT SIX WITH

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:58.142
SEPARATION WE TOOK OUT THREE

02:26:58.209 --> 02:27:00.278
DESIGN. WE DID THINGS LIKE

02:27:00.344 --> 02:27:01.679
LOADING EVERY OTHER ROADS WE

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:03.648
DID THE THINGS THAT WE SAID

02:27:03.714 --> 02:27:05.283
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE COMMITMENT

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:06.617
AND LIVE UP TO THE SAFETY

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:09.253
GUIDELINES PROTOCOLS WHICH WE

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:12.290
DON'T NEED NEVER DID NEED A

02:27:12.356 --> 02:27:14.292
2550% LIMITATION ON US. THE

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.927
SAFETY PROTOCOLS GIVE US OUR

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:17.895
LIMITATIONS AND WITH THE SAFETY

02:27:17.962 --> 02:27:19.263
PROTOCOLS WE'VE BEEN PUT IN

02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.566
PLACE HONESTLY TO GET ABOVE

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.434
3540% IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOR

02:27:23.501 --> 02:27:24.802
WOULD WE WANT TO BECAUSE THE G.

02:27:24.869 --> 02:27:26.070
SEPTIC GUEST SATISFACTION

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.572
NUMBER WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR

02:27:27.638 --> 02:27:29.407
NOBODY COME BACK. SO THE

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:31.342
REALITY OF IT IS THE ACTUAL

02:27:31.409 --> 02:27:33.077
PHYSICAL DISTINGUIR GARMENTS

02:27:33.144 --> 02:27:34.579
THAT WE MANDATE IN OUR QUEUE

02:27:34.645 --> 02:27:35.313
LINES IN OUR TRACKS AND

02:27:35.379 --> 02:27:36.914
EVERYTHING ELSE ARE GONNA

02:27:36.981 --> 02:27:38.749
DETERMINE THAT PERCENTAGE NO WE

02:27:38.816 --> 02:27:39.817
UNDERSTAND STATE WILL PROBABLY

02:27:39.884 --> 02:27:40.785
WANT TO LOOK AT A PERCENTAGE WE

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:43.020
GET THAT. BUT UNDERSTAND IT'S

02:27:43.087 --> 02:27:45.957
ALREADY THERE FOR US IN WHERE

02:27:46.023 --> 02:27:49.160
WE OPERATE AROUND THE GLOBE.

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:50.728
MOST IMPORTANTLY GETTING

02:27:50.795 --> 02:27:51.262
CALIFORNIANS BACK TO WORK

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:53.931
SAFELY. I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT

02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:55.233
THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE MORE

02:27:55.299 --> 02:27:57.902
THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:27:57.969 --> 02:27:59.937
DOLLARS OF CONSTRUCTION WORK IS

02:28:00.004 --> 02:28:03.274
NO LONGER. ONE COMPANY FIVE

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.508
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

02:28:04.575 --> 02:28:07.044
CONSTRUCTION WORK ON CAPITOL.

02:28:07.111 --> 02:28:10.214
OFF THE BOOKS. THE SOONER WE

02:28:10.281 --> 02:28:11.816
CAN GET BACK OPEN THE SOONER

02:28:11.882 --> 02:28:13.284
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT POTENTIAL

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:14.418
NEW PROJECTS ON THE ROAD

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:16.320
BECAUSE NEW PROJECTS MEAN

02:28:16.387 --> 02:28:18.222
CONSTANT VISITATION BUT

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:20.224
UNDERSTANDING IN THIS MARKET

02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:21.292
AND I WILL BE BACK WITH THE

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:22.426
THERE'S A CALIFORNIA GIRL ON

02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:24.729
THE TEAM SAID. GUESS WHAT THIS

02:28:24.795 --> 02:28:26.631
IS ALL DRIVE MARKET RIGHT NOW I

02:28:26.697 --> 02:28:27.698
KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S FOLKS WANT

02:28:27.765 --> 02:28:28.766
TO LOOK AT A MILEAGE AND SO

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:31.235
FORTH IT IS ALL PRIVATE MARKET.

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:33.204
I KNOW. BECAUSE I'M THE ONE

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:34.105
THAT GETS TO DEAL WITH THE

02:28:34.171 --> 02:28:35.106
BUSINESS JUST TO TRY TO GET

02:28:35.172 --> 02:28:36.941
SOME VENDORS BACK INTO JAPAN

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:38.643
AND CHINA. NOBODY'S TRAVELING.

02:28:38.709 --> 02:28:39.810
FACT ONE OF THE FEW COMPANIES

02:28:39.877 --> 02:28:40.711
THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:42.246
BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING A PARK

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:43.881
IN THE MIDDLE OF BEIJING. TALK

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:44.682
ABOUT SOME REAL IN THE MIDDLE

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:46.717
OF ALL THIS. I HAD TO GET THREE

02:28:46.784 --> 02:28:48.152
HUNDRED PEOPLE BACK INTO

02:28:48.219 --> 02:28:49.887
BEIJING IN THE MIDDLE OF COLOR.

02:28:49.954 --> 02:28:51.322
BUT THE REALITY OF IT IS I WILL

02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:52.256
TELL YOU WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS

02:28:52.323 --> 02:28:53.224
ARE PLACED ON THE INTERNATIONAL

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:55.860
TRAVEL ANOTHER QUESTION WAS

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:57.194
ASKED BEFORE. IT'S NOT HAVE.

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.696
OKAY JUST TODAY I WAS ON THE

02:28:58.763 --> 02:28:59.930
PHONE THE JAPANESE EMBASSY

02:28:59.997 --> 02:29:02.633
TRYING TO GET SIX HUNDRED

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:03.267
PACKAGE DIDN'T TO JAPAN. SO THE

02:29:03.334 --> 02:29:06.237
REALITY IS. WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:08.739
GETTING. WORKERS BACK HERE. WE

02:29:08.806 --> 02:29:10.541
KNOW THE VISITATION WILL BE

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:12.076
WITHIN THE LOCAL MARKET THAT

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:13.344
PRODUCT. YES WILL BE A LITTLE

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:15.780
LOUDER YOU ASK BUT NOT AS MUCH

02:29:15.846 --> 02:29:18.082
AS YOU WOULD THINK. SO AS

02:29:18.149 --> 02:29:19.450
PEOPLE WORRY AND THAT'S REALLY

02:29:19.517 --> 02:29:20.518
WHAT I WANT TO TAKE AND TAKE

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:23.254
YOUR MIND. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

02:29:23.321 --> 02:29:23.821
A THEME PARK YOU THINK ABOUT

02:29:23.888 --> 02:29:25.256
THE FOURTH OF JULY. YOU THINK

02:29:25.323 --> 02:29:29.260
ABOUT JAMPACKED PARKS. WITH THE

02:29:29.327 --> 02:29:29.894
SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT'S NOT THE

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:32.430
NORM ANYMORE AND WE HAVE GOT TO

02:29:32.496 --> 02:29:34.932
GET THE STATE OFF THE MIND SET

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:38.569
UP I SEE A HUGE BUNCH OF PEOPLE

02:29:38.636 --> 02:29:40.104
IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IN FACT

02:29:40.171 --> 02:29:41.505
THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL

02:29:41.572 --> 02:29:43.407
QUESTIONS SAYING ALL THESE.

02:29:43.474 --> 02:29:45.176
FACTORS THAT I PUT ON THE ON

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:46.410
THE BOARD AGAIN I KNOW I'M FROM

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:47.611
RUSSIA TO KEEP YOU GUYS ON

02:29:47.678 --> 02:29:49.613
SCHEDULE. BUT THERE'S A

02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.215
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AT ALL THE

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:52.316
HEALTH OFFICIALS EXPECT THE

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:53.551
POLITICS OF IT ALL THE HEALTH

02:29:53.617 --> 02:29:56.887
OFFICIALS HAVE SAID. TO ME

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:58.956
PERSONALLY AROUND THE GLOBE.

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:00.758
HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE PHYSICAL

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:03.728
DISTANCING AND WE GO THROUGH

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.463
THE PROTOCOLS AND THEY GO YOU

02:30:05.529 --> 02:30:07.298
ARE PART OF THE ANSWER BECAUSE

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:09.333
PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO STAY IN

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:10.334
THEIR HOMES ANOTHER SIX MONTHS

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:13.137
TO A YEAR THEY'RE JUST NOT. WE

02:30:13.204 --> 02:30:14.505
KNOW WHERE THE TRANSMISSIONS

02:30:14.572 --> 02:30:16.040
ARE HAPPENING A LOT OF TIMES

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:17.274
ARE HAPPENING THOSE LARGE

02:30:17.341 --> 02:30:18.676
FAMILY BARBECUES AND EVERYTHING

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:20.044
ELSE WHEN YOU GET THE

02:30:20.111 --> 02:30:22.346
GATHERINGS PEOPLE FEEL CLOSE

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:23.381
THEY SEEM TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

02:30:23.447 --> 02:30:24.382
WE'RE WE REALLY SHOULD BE

02:30:24.448 --> 02:30:25.649
ASKING REGARDLESS OF THE

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:28.119
VOLUMES IN WE'RE CAN YOU PUT

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:29.954
PEOPLE SAFELY. THAT WILL GIVE

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:31.389
THEM AN OUTLET. GIVE THEM

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:33.391
SOMETHING TO DO BUT NOW YOU'VE

02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:35.359
GOT THE REGULATORY. REGULATORY

02:30:35.426 --> 02:30:36.961
CONTROLS TO CREATE THAT

02:30:37.027 --> 02:30:40.164
PHYSICAL DISTANCES. THEME PARKS

02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:42.500
ARE YOUR ANSWER. AND I KNOW

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:44.602
THAT'S WEIRD SOME STRANGE. BUT

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:46.437
WHEN THE HEALTH OFFICIALS IN

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:49.006
BOTH FLORIDA AND JAPAN NOT THE

02:30:49.073 --> 02:30:50.441
POLITICIANS ON ANYBODY ELSE

02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:51.175
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A

02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:54.912
DIFFERENCE IN THE MINDSETS OF

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.480

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:05.322
HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT MADE THE

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:07.358

DEVASTATED TOURISM ECONOMY I

02:57:24.233 --> 02:57:25.768
THE PRETTY COMMON AMONGST THE-

02:57:25.835 --> 02:57:28.437
INDUSTRY. I WONDER THAT IN THE

02:57:28.504 --> 02:57:29.872
IN THE IMPACT OF THE RESTAURANT

02:57:29.939 --> 02:57:31.540
COLLEAGUES- AND I'M- STAYED IN

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:38.347
CONTACT. WITH ALL MY ALL I CAN

02:57:38.414 --> 02:57:39.281
ALMOST RELATIONS IN THE REST

02:57:39.348 --> 02:57:41.717
BUSINESS LIMóN. YEAH THERE A

02:57:41.784 --> 02:57:42.451
LEAST THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET

02:57:42.518 --> 02:57:43.886
THE NEED THE MONEY. THEY'RE NOT

02:57:43.953 --> 02:57:47.356
GOING TO SIT. OF UP ON IT. THE

02:57:47.423 --> 02:57:48.290
ONLY THING YOU DO THIS RIGHT

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:49.892

THEN YOU HAVE OF THE GUY OPEN%

02:57:52.728 --> 02:57:53.829
CLOSE NOW DON'T THINK. ANYBODY

02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:56.232
IN THE SIX OF WAY. OR THE STATE

02:57:56.298 --> 02:57:57.833
SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

02:57:57.900 --> 02:58:00.169
REALIZES HOW PAINFUL AND

02:58:00.236 --> 02:58:02.571
EXPENSIVE IT IS TO TURN OFF AND

02:58:02.638 --> 02:58:04.373
OPEN THE FAUCET EVERY TIME. AND

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:05.674
THESE RESTRICTIONS OUT OF GONE

02:58:05.741 --> 02:58:07.476
WHEN YOU HIRE YOUR STUFF BACK

02:58:07.543 --> 02:58:08.377
IN THE TRIGGERMAN PUT AN

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:09.612
INVENTORY. WE'VE ALREADY

02:58:09.678 --> 02:58:11.113
WRITTEN OFF TO LOWER LAYERS OF

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:12.882
INVENTORY IN THE INDUSTRY

02:58:12.948 --> 02:58:14.216
THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE THEY'RE

02:58:14.283 --> 02:58:17.353
ALREADY OUT OF ACTION IT'S NOT

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:18.120
GONNA WORK. THEY IN TURN YOU

02:58:18.187 --> 02:58:20.122
HAVE TO. PATTERSON GOT IS

02:58:20.189 --> 02:58:21.323
ANOTHER PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN

02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:23.092
YOU START THIS OPENING CLOSING.

02:58:23.159 --> 02:58:24.360
IT'S A CHICKEN LITTLE AFFECTED

02:58:24.427 --> 02:58:25.728
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS WHAT WHAT

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:26.996
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO DO. AND

02:58:27.063 --> 02:58:29.165
THE LEADERSHIP IN SACRAMENTO IS

02:58:29.231 --> 02:58:30.800
GIVING INCONSISTENT MESSAGES

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:32.835
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE COVERAGE

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:35.571
EXPERIENCE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT

02:58:35.638 --> 02:58:36.105
IT'S RIPPLING THROUGH THE

02:58:36.172 --> 02:58:38.040
TOURISM INDUSTRY. HOSPITALITY

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:39.809
AND THEN PARTICULARLY IN THE

02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:41.310
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. AND WHEN

02:58:41.377 --> 02:58:42.111
I'M REFERRING THE RESTAURANTS

02:58:42.178 --> 02:58:43.546
ON TALKING MORE OR LESS ABOUT

02:58:43.612 --> 02:58:45.281
FULL SERVICE RESTAURANTS. THAT

02:58:45.347 --> 02:58:46.749
ARE THE HIGH PAYING JOBS THAT

02:58:46.816 --> 02:58:48.651
REPRESENT INCOME. NOT THIS FAST

02:58:48.717 --> 02:58:50.853
FOOD QUICK SERVE FIFTEEN DOLLAR

02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:52.721
AN HOUR POSITIONS. ARJUN ARE

02:58:52.788 --> 02:58:56.358
THE ONES THAT PEOPLE RELY ON

02:58:56.425 --> 02:58:56.892
FOR THEIR EFFORT TO MAKE A

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:57.893
LIVING. SO THE ECONOMIC SHOCKS

02:58:57.960 --> 02:58:59.595
TREMENDOUS WHEN YOU HAVE THESE

02:58:59.662 --> 02:59:01.664
POSITIVE CASES. IF ONE PERSON

02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:03.599
IN YOUR STAFF TEST POSITIVE

02:59:03.666 --> 02:59:04.633
YOU'RE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THREE

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.602
DAYS. AND THAT'S A BIG ISSUE

02:59:06.669 --> 02:59:08.304
AND A VERY COSTLY ONE FOR EVERY

02:59:08.370 --> 02:59:09.171
RESTAURANT THAT EXPERIENCE IS

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:11.107
THAT. AND IT IT GENERALLY THE

02:59:11.173 --> 02:59:12.141
ODDS ARE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

UP LATER ON. CORPORATION CANCEL

LEVEL GOVERNANCE THAT IS

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:24.019
CONFLICTED. FOR INSTANCE AYE

CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT. OUR OUR

02:59:34.430 --> 02:59:36.632
GOVERNMENTS TO ALLOW. FOR

02:59:36.699 --> 02:59:38.033
BUSINESSES TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:39.068
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AN TO

02:59:39.135 --> 02:59:40.936

02:59:47.676 --> 02:59:48.244
FATE OF THE ENTIRE COUNTY RIGHT

02:59:48.310 --> 02:59:49.712
NOW. THAT'S TERRIBLE YEAH

ROOMS THAT'S THE REVENUE. YOU

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:05.494
GO DOWN THE WHOLE LIST IS JUST

03:00:05.561 --> 03:00:07.163
THE START OF A SCENARIO SO

03:00:07.229 --> 03:00:10.232
THERE'S NO OPTION IN THE DAY.

03:00:10.299 --> 03:00:10.833
FOR FULL SERVICE REST NOT TO

03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:15.237
RESTAURANT OWNER RIGHT THERE.

03:00:15.304 --> 03:00:15.838
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO

03:00:15.905 --> 03:00:17.273
TAKE THAT THAT PICTURE HOME.

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:18.274
MONEY IS. YOU HAVE A CHOICE

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:19.608
WILL CHOICES ARE BAY. OR

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:21.076
THINKING BY WAY THANK. I'M

03:00:21.143 --> 03:00:23.646
REFERRING TO HOPING. THAT

03:00:23.712 --> 03:00:24.613
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME

03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:26.048
BECAUSE I'M NOT SCARED OFF FROM

03:00:26.115 --> 03:00:27.483
FROM PATRONIZING RESTAURANT

03:00:27.550 --> 03:00:29.451
THAT'S ALLOWED TO OPEN UP. FOR

03:00:29.518 --> 03:00:31.453
OR PUTTING IN SUCH RESTRICTIONS

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.755
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM

03:00:32.821 --> 03:00:35.591
TO OPEN. YOU ALSO LOOK AT ALL

03:00:35.658 --> 03:00:36.859
PROVIDING ART THAT'S A GREAT.

03:00:36.926 --> 03:00:38.561
SOLUTION UP UNTIL NOW.

03:00:38.627 --> 03:00:40.162
PSYCHOLOGICAL IN CALIFORNIA THE

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:40.963
MINUTE RANGE PEOPLE STOPPING

03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:42.631
GOING OUT WITH CITY OUTSIDE TO

03:00:42.698 --> 03:00:44.433
GO TO A RESTAURANT. AND IT'S

03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.635
VERY DIFFICULT TO STAFF AN

03:00:46.702 --> 03:00:49.505
OUTDOOR DINING ONLY SCENARIO TO

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:50.005
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE

03:00:50.072 --> 03:00:50.539
WEATHER'S GOING TO BE A-

03:00:50.606 --> 03:00:51.540
SCHEDULE THE PEOPLE SHOW UP AND

03:00:51.607 --> 03:00:53.275
START SPRINKLING. NOBODY SITS

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:55.144
DOWN AND THEN HAVE THAT. LIKE I

03:00:55.211 --> 03:00:56.312
SAID EARLIER ONE CASE OF

03:00:56.378 --> 03:00:58.280
PROVIDENCE STAFF. IN THE BACK

03:00:58.347 --> 03:01:00.082
OF THE HOUSE FORCES RESTAURANT

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:02.351
TO CLOSE SO- WELL IT'S HARD TO

03:01:02.418 --> 03:01:03.185
THIS ONE ALREADY THIS IS NOW

03:01:03.252 --> 03:01:05.287
DURING CERTAIN THE SCENARIO.

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:06.956
ARE YOU HAVE A SKILLED GROUP

03:01:07.022 --> 03:01:07.890
OWNER PLUS ONE COOK IN THE

03:01:07.957 --> 03:01:09.258
SERVER. SO THIS WOULD BE A

03:01:09.325 --> 03:01:10.526
RESTAURANT TYPICALLY THAT HAS

03:01:10.593 --> 03:01:13.095
INTERIOR SEATING FOUR HUNDRED A

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:14.563
HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE. AND NO

03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:15.931
LONGER HAVE THAT THEY'RE

03:01:15.998 --> 03:01:17.066
DEALING WITH FALLOUT FOUR FIVE

03:01:17.132 --> 03:01:18.968
TABLES OUT OF THE PARKLAND.

03:01:19.034 --> 03:01:19.802
THEY HAVE A BILL THAT PARKER BY

03:01:19.868 --> 03:01:22.238
THE WAY. AND I AM READY BUILT

03:01:22.304 --> 03:01:23.839
PLEXIGLASS SHIELDING ON THEIR

03:01:23.906 --> 03:01:25.908
SEEDING. TO ALLOW FOR INDOOR

03:01:25.975 --> 03:01:27.977
DINING THAT WOULD SHUT DOWN.

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:29.745
FIVE MONTHS AGO SO THEY WON'T

03:01:29.812 --> 03:01:31.547
SPEND A SMALL BUSINESS SPENDING

03:01:31.614 --> 03:01:32.982
ALREADY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

03:01:33.048 --> 03:01:35.251
AT THE REQUEST. OF THE

03:01:35.317 --> 03:01:35.818
GUIDELINES OF THE STATE OF

03:01:35.884 --> 03:01:37.553
CALIFORNIA. AND THEY'RE NOT

03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:39.054
EVEN ABLE TO USE THAT SO IT'S

03:01:39.121 --> 03:01:40.956
SOMETHING MONEY. S. AND

03:01:41.023 --> 03:01:46.328
RECOVERABLE SO. 25% ENDORSING

03:01:46.395 --> 03:01:47.863
AREA. YOU STILL HAVE ONE KIRK

03:01:47.930 --> 03:01:48.831
ONE SERVER AND THERE'S CHANGE

03:01:48.897 --> 03:01:49.598
BECAUSE YOU JUST DON'T. THE

03:01:49.665 --> 03:01:51.533
VOTES. TWENTY FIVE PER. IS

03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:54.503
TERRIBLE SO. CONSIDER THIS. 25%

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:56.872
SEATING CAPACITY IS EQUIVALENT

03:01:56.939 --> 03:01:57.473
OF FLYING A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN

03:01:57.539 --> 03:01:58.941
WITH ONE ENGINE. IT'S GOING TO

03:01:59.008 --> 03:02:00.242
IT WON'T TAKE OFF BUT IT

03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:01.877
CERTAINLY CRASH. AND THAT'S

03:02:01.944 --> 03:02:03.312
