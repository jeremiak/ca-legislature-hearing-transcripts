THE BILITY SCAN BEFORE THEIR AND ARE FACING A SURGE IN HOMELESSNESS THIS LEGISLATION FURTHERS THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING GOAL OF PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS AMONG OLDER ADULTS. THIS LEGISLATION IS VALUES DRIVEN AND REQUIRES A- TEN VISION HOUSING AS A COMPONENT OF HEALTHY LIVING AS WE AGE. TO HELP GRASP THE NEED I WANT TO SHARE SOME VERY SIMPLE STATISTICS ABOUT RENT AND INCOME FAIR MARKET RENT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HUD'S ESTIMATE OF MEDIAN RENTS. FOR NON LUXURY APARTMENT INCREASED A HUNDRED AND 16% SINCE TWO THOUSAND. FROM SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION TO TWENTY TWENTY DOLLARS MEDIAN RENTS STILL INCREASED 35% FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY.

IN THE PAST TWO DECADES THIS CRISIS HAS BEEN GROWING WITH ME REPRESENTING A PORTION OF THE COALITION BEHIND AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN- IS YES MAIN- PUBLIC THE PAYLOAD WITH THE JUSTICE IN AGING. WAIT. TEACHER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS YES MEAN PALETTE ON BEHALF OF JUSTICE MAGING PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB TWO FIVE FOUR SEVEN JUSTICE IN AGING IS A NATIONAL LEGAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO ENDING SENIOR POVERTY AND ADVANCING EQUITY FOR OLDER ADULTS WE APPRECIATE THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ESPECIALLY THE CHAIRS ALL OF THIS IMPORTANT GOAL CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING OLDER RENTERS ARE PAYING MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME FOR RENT LEAVING THEM VULNERABLE TO EVICTION AND HOMELESSNESS. CALIFORNIANS AGE FIFTY AND OLDER ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AGE GROUP EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NOW COMPRISING 45% OF CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND THERE ARE STARK RACIAL DISPARITIES WITH BLACK OLDER ADULTS TIME AT A FIVE TIMES GREATER RISK. WHAT'S THAT ARE WHITE PART. AB TWO FOUR SEVEN THE HOW STABILIZATION ACT ADVANCES A KEY GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING TO PREVENT AND OLDER ADULTS AND DISABLED ADULT HOMELESSNESS. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A MULTI YEAR RUN STABILIZATION FUND TO PROVIDE RENTAL SUBSIDIES TO THIS POPULATION WHO ARE AT IMMINENT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS OR CURRENTLY ON HOUSE. STUDY SHOW THAT HOUSING SUBSIDIES ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS THIS FUND WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA OF AGING WHICH TO COME. TO WHAT THIRTY. THERE PROGRAMS AND CAN BE BASED OR- WE ESTIMATED THIS PROGRAM WOULD ENABLE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ANNUALLY TO ACCESS OR THANK. SEVEN AND PEOPLE RECEIVING SUBSIDIES THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WILL BE LINKED TO AND PRIORITIZED FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED HOUSING SUBSIDIES THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHARON REPORT AND I'M WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHERE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SEVEN. I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE STORY OF WALLACE RICHARDS AND WELLS BECAME HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME AT AGE FIFTY SEVEN HE HAD LIVED IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND IT ENDED HOUSE L. WHEN HIS FATHER PASSED AWAY HIS LINK TO MANY OF HIS CONSTRUCTION JOBS WITH. AT THE SAME TIME HIS WIFE OF TWENTY YEARS ASKED FOR A DIVORCE AND SHE ENDED UP KEEPING HOUSE AND HE MOVED IN WITH HIS MOTHER. WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED SUDDENLY HE REALIZED HE COULDN'T KEEP PAYING THE RENT ON THEIR HOUSE AND HAD TO MOVE INTO THIS TRACK. HE SAID FIFTY SEVEN OLD I WAS HOMELESS AND FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF ALL SIX FEET TWO INCHES OF ME SLEPT IN THE FIVE FOOT CAB OF MY TRUCK. IT WAS MISERABLE. I SUFFER THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING TO RELIEVE MYSELF IN THE ALLEY. AND HAVING TO PUT TO. TRACK WHEN IS TO GET AS BEST I COULD BUT I WAS DEPRESSED AND LOST I WAS REALLY DRAFTING TRUST ME UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN THERE UNTIL YOU'VE ACTUALLY BEEN HOMELESS YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT THIS IS LIKE I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE AT LEAST I HAD THE SHELTER OF MY TRUCK SO MANY OTHERS I ENCOUNTERED HAD ONLY THE HARD COLD CEMENT. TO GREET THEM AT NIGHT. WALLACE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THE HOTEL ROOM THROUGH PROJECT ROOM KEY TEMPORARILY BUT THEN HAD TO MOVE OUT AND AGAIN ENDED UP IN HIS TRUCK. EVENTUALLY HE MADE A CASE MANAGER WHO HELPED HIM. ACCESS A HOUSING SUBSIDY AN APARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING WHERE HE'S LIVED FOR TWO YEARS. WELL AS SAID NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE AND I'M ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO ME. I'M LEARNING KEYBOARDING AND COMPUTING AND HOPE TO EARN A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE. I'M MAKING SOMETHING OF MYSELF AND I WANT TO GET BACK. WELL THIS RICHARDSON IS ONE OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM HOUSING SUBSIDIES. BUT HE ADMITS HE WAS A LUCKY ONE. SO MANY OTHER OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL LIVING IN THEIR CARS TRUCKS OR THAT COLD HARD CEMENT TO GREET THEM AT NIGHT THAT WHILE THIS TALKED ABOUT. HOUSING SUBSIDIES HAVE REDUCED HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS BY OVER 40% NATIONWIDE AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WOULD SIMILARLY HELP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES GET INTO DECENT SAFE HOME TO LAY THEIR HEADS AT NIGHT.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYONE HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS OR COMMENTS. OKAY I HAVE SOME SHORT COMMENTS. BY WILL ABSTAIN ON HIS BILL. AND HERE'S WHY I'M NOT AGAINST IT. WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN DO. THE CHAIR AND I HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS TOGETHER- BASICALLY. SPITTING INTO THE WIND. BECAUSE THE BABY BOOMERS IS A TSUNAMI. AND MANY IS OF THE BABY BOOMERS THAT DIDN'T MAKE MONEY THAT THAT WORKED OUR WHOLE LIVES MINIMUM WAGE THEY'RE IN DEEP TROUBLE THE AVERAGE SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS YOU CAN'T RENT TO CHECK FOR THAT REALLY. AND THE MINIMUM IS NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. IN THE MINIMUM MINIMUM- IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE THAT ARE BASICALLY HOMELESS. SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LIVING ON THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HOMELESS SO. I'M NOT CRITICIZING THIS BILL IN ANY WAY WE'RE WE'RE GOOD. BUT WE'VE SPENT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS OF FOR THE AGED WHICH I QUALIFY FOR THE AGED PART. I'M M. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS ARE WE GET IN OUR BANG FOR THE BUCK. PROBABLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT- A BILL IN THE FUTURE THAT EITHER THE CHAIR OR YOU ALL SHOULD BRING FORWARD WOULD BE LOOKING AT REFORMS. FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND THAT COULD GO THROUGH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THEY COULD GO THROUGH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IT COULD GO THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE NEED TO LOOK FROM A BUSINESS VIEWPOINT NONPARTISAN JUST. HOW CAN WE BETTER SPEND THE MONEY. AND MY ONE THING THAT IS BY DEFAULT MEMBER I'M FO YOUR BILL HOUSING FIRST. RIGHT BUT WE SHOULD BE GOING IN MY OPINION. CLEANING UP THE DRUGS FIRST. IT SEEMS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. HELP PEOPLE GET CLEAN AND SOBER AND ALL THESE PROGRAMS WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF MY CITY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE HAD EIGHTY TWO. HOMELESS PROGRAMS SETS EIGHTY TWO CEOS VICE PRESIDENTS CFO'S EXCEPT HER SO MOST OF THE HOMELESS MONEY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I KNOW WAS GOING TO INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE HOMELESS ORGANIZATIONS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL SO I WILL BE A RESPECTFULLY BECAUSE YOU ARE MY DEAR FRIEND. ABSTAINED THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- JUST GIVEN THE VULNERABILITIES OF THE COMMUNITY THE CONSTITUENCY THAT WERE SPEAKING OF- IT'S A IT'S YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT A LOT OF REFORMS BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE REAR OF PEOPLE COMING LIST IN THE SHORT TERM AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A QUICK STOP- IT DRESSES. ROUGHLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE- IT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH SO IT'S JUST ONE STEP IN IN THE DIRECTION OF. MAKING SURE THAT WERE- ESTABLISHING A- CATCH BASIN AT THE SYSTEM OF MAKING SURE THAT- NOT EVERYONE IS FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS- BE IT A SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE COALITION ON WORKING WITH. WITH ME AND WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL- AS WELL AS MY STAFF- MY LEAD CONSULTANT ON WORKING ON THIS BILL AND TRYING TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS VULNERABLE TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ADDRESSED- MEASURES THE- WITH THAT SAID I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX CREATES THE RESIDENT DESIGNATED SUCH PERSONS ACT THE ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE AMENDMENTS INTENDED TO CLARIFY SOME ASPECTS OF THE BILL TODAY I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE ON THE BILL IN PRINT AND THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN NEXT WEEK IN ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES. THIS MEASURE IS A PRODUCT OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX- IN SHORES ALL RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES THE RIGHT TO IN PERSON ON SITE AND ON SCHEDULED VISITATION FROM A MINIMUM OF TWO RESIDENT DESIGNATED. SUPPORT PERSONS- DURING ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN WHICH A RESIDENTS NORMAL VISITATION RIGHTS ARE CURTAILED SUPPORT PERSONS PROVIDE A CRITICAL AND OFTEN LIFESAVING ROLE IN THE LIVES OF RESIDENTS IN CARE FACILITY IS SETTINGS. THEY PROVIDE AMONG OTHER THINGS COMPANIONSHIP COGNITIVE STIMULATION. COMMUNICATION AND DECISION MAKING ASSISTANCE OFTENTIMES THEY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY LIVING TASKS SUCH AS EATING DRESSING AND HYGIENE. THEY PROVIDE MEANINGFUL CONNECTION TRANSPORTATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THE FULL EXTENT OF THE SUPPORT WAS POORLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEERS WHO AUTHORIZED VISITATION LOCKOUTS. DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OR OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS ARE INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE OVERSIGHT BODIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR ORDINARY SUPERVISORY. FUNCTIONS IN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC SUPPORT PERSONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN BARRED FROM VISITING AT A TIME WHEN RESIDENTS NEEDED THEM THE MOST. THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE A STAGGERING NUMBER OF ALL FACILITY LETTERS PUT OUT BY DPH THE MAJORITY IMPACTING CARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DSS PUT OUT PROVIDER INFORMATION NOTICES AN EXPONENTIALLY GREATER NUMBERS AS WELL. CARE FACILITIES WERE DEALING WITH COVERED NINETEEN OUTBREAKS INCREASED INFECTION PROTOCOLS STAFFING SHORTAGES AND MORE AS NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY DPH AND DSS THE IMPORTANCE OF IN PERSON VISITATION WAS FORGOTTEN. THE MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH COVERT NINETEEN ISOLATION IS STILL DATA THAT REMAINS ELUSIVE AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX AUTHORIZES THE FACILITY TO ROUTE REQUIRED AS- SUPER. INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS REQUIRED OF CARE STAFF DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ALL INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS MUST BE COMMUNICATED TO THE DESIGNATED SUPPORT PERSONS PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX CANNOT BE SUSPENDED SUPERSEDED OR MODIFIED BY A STATE OR LOCAL ORDER. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY SIX ART TONY- CHICKEN TELL REPRESENTING CANNER AND MIGHT LEE WEISSMAN REPRESENTING THE ESSENTIAL CARE GIVER COALITION. THANK OU A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S TONY CHICKEN TELLEM SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. VERY EXCITED TO TESTIFY ABOUT AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX- AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX IS ABOUT CORRECTING A MISTAKE OF A VERY HORRIBLE MISTAKEN FOR CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT MISTAKE TO EVER BE REPEATED. I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO TELL THIS COMMITTEE THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN THE WORST TWO YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF LONG TERM CARE- THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN STAGGERING. CALCULABLE WE HAVE WE NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT LEAST FOURTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS OF RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA- BUT WHICH SUFFERED TREMENDOUS LOSS FROM ISOLATION AND- THE LOSS. FROM ISOLATION IS DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU 1100% THAT IT HAS BEEN EVERY BIT AS DEVASTATING. AND TERRIBLE AS THE DEATHS HAVE BEEN- WHAT MAKES THIS LOSS EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING IS THAT IT'S BEEN THE RESULT OF POLICY DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE- IGNORANTLY AND MISGUIDED LEE. FUNDAMENTALLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES BLEW IT. THEY WERE BOTH MYOPIC AND ENUMERATE THEY FOCUSED ON KOBE NINETEEN INFECTION RATES BUT PERFORMED NO DATA ANALYSIS ON RESIDENT OUTCOMES CONSIDERING THAT THEY WERE DISCONNECTED FROM THE PEOPLE THAT THEY CARED ABOUT THE MOST AND WHO CARED ABOUT THEM THE MOST. EPIDEMIOLOGY IS. AN EVIDENCE AND DATA BUT WHAT WE GOT WAS. A POLICY BASED ON HUNCHES AND- IN A VERY NARROW VIEW OF WHAT RESIDENT WELL BEING AND HEALTH IS. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LAWMAKERS RELIED ON A TRAGICALLY FLAWED PREMISE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE PORTANTINO WELLBEING THEN THE FIRST. HALF THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG SUPPORT PERSON VISITORS PERFORM MANY OF THE SAME SERVICES AS FACILITIES STAFF. TO KEEP RESIDENTS ALIVE AND TO HELP THEM GET BETTER. AND THEY BRING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELL BEING. LOVE POLICY MAKERS MOST OF WHOM HAVE NEVER SET FOOT IN A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY IN A PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY. SIMPLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER SUPPORT PERSONS BRING TO RESIDENTS. WHAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLETELY IN CURIOUS ABOUT REAL RESIDENT EXPERIENCE. WAS A SUPPORT PERSON. THE LUXURY. I CANNOT CONVEY TO YOU HOW AWFUL THE LOCKOUTS HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY RESIDENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES. I HAVE SPOKEN TO SCORES OF THEM SPOUSES BROTHERS SISTERS AND CHILDREN OF RESIDENTS WHO WERE DENIED ACCESS TO SUPPORT THEIR LOVED ONES. TO BE PRESENT TO COMFORT THEM WHEN THEY WERE DYING. RESIDENT AND FAMILIES HAVE BEEN LEFT. TO WATCH DEATHS VIA FACETIME AND ZOOM. AB TWO FIVE FOUR SIX IS A CHANCE TO SHOW WE CAN LEARN AND GET BETTER OUR POLICIES WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTIVE OF RESIN ACCESS TO SUPPORT PERSONS WE HAVE LEARNED THAT DESPITE COVERT OR ANY OTHER PANDEMIC THERE IS NOTHING WORSE FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITY RESIDENTS. THAT TO CUT OFF THE CARE AND LOVE THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M BLANCA CASTRO IN THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE AGING LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE- ARE LETTER FOR THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN HAS BEEN SUBMITTED WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT.
