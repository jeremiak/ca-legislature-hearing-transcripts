TWELVE FORTY EIGHT IT FOR IF YOU'RE READY TO GO. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND I HEY. AT THIS IN HERE AS A- BASEBALL FAN. PRESENTING SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT FOR THE MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS IS THAT BIPARTISAN MEASURE WHICH WILL IMPROVE PLAYER TREATMENT BY THE MAJOR LEAGUE. UNEMPLOYED WORKERS FOR THE MOST MINOR LEAGUERS MAKE LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR. FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN SEASON MOB GROW REVENUE. YOUR LARA LEFT BILLION THIS. CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF. AND I THOUSAND INCREASE SINCE SEVENTY FIVE. BUT THE SAME PERIOD BY THE PLAYERS IN CREE JUST SEVEN FIVE PER OVER THE- FORTY FIVE YOU'RE PURE- THE WORK CONDITIONS. OF MY LEADERS HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. AND THESE THIS BILL NOR THE PLAYERS ARE ASKING FOR THAT MUCH ONLY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. FAIR TREATMENT AND DECENT CONDITIONS. ADVANCE AGREE WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT OVER SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. OF FANS SAID MILEY PLAYER TREATMENT AND COMPENSATION. THIS BILL DOES A FEW POINT THINGS FOCUS ON THE- U. P. C. THE UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACTED ALL PLAYERS MUST SIGN IT DEFINES A MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER. AND BE CLEAR PRIOR TO THIS BILL THE SAID CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS CONSIDER BASEBALL PLAYER EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. YEAH I UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS FACT IS NOT BEEN DISPUTED ONGOING LITIGATION. THAT'S RIGHT COMMITTED TO THE CHAIR. THAT WE WILL AMEND THE BILL MOVING FORWARD TO NOT COMMENT ON THIS LITIGATION AROUND A PLEA CLASSIFICATIONS WERE TAKING OUT THAT PART OF THE BILL. OF REMAINING SECONDLY IT REDUCES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF YEARS A PLAYER CAN BE ON CONTRACT BY THE END OF YOUR OWNER'S. FROM SEVEN YEARS TO FOUR YEARS. IF A PLAYER AT THE END OF FOR YOUR PEER WHAT'S DOWN IS FREE AGENT THEY CAN DO SO. AT A LEVEL WAGE. ALTERING THIS OVERLY RESTRICTIVE CONTRACT WILL REDUCE THE TIME SPENT RECEIVING. THE WAGES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AND WE FOUR YEARS IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO EVALUATE PLAYER. THIRD PARTY FROM THE GREAT WORK OF OUR COLLEAGUE CENTER SKINNER RELIGION NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THIS BILL IS FOR THE PLAYERS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO COME BE COMPENSATED FOR OPPORTUNITIES. I OUTSIDE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER FOR EXAMPLE. OF THAT THE VIDEO GAME MLB THE SHOW. IS SELLING FOR SEVEN DOLLARS EACH EMPLOYERS HAVE NOT SEEN. A PENNY FROM THAT. A THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE- NOT ONE WORKER IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE MISTREATED BY THEIR EMPLOYERS AND- THE MOB IS NO EXCEPTION. AS SO OFTEN THE CASE CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY HERE WE STRONG SUPPORT FROM PLAYERS FANS AT PLAYER ADVOCATES LABOR. BUT IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE FRANCE SMALL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S AGREED THAT THE STATUS QUO IN THIS SITUATION CANNOT GO ON. ALSO A STATE THAT WE HAD REGULAR CONTACT WITH MLB TEAMS- AND EVERY MANY TIMES BEFORE AND UNION STATION AROUND FREE AGENCY EITHER RECEIVE WITH THE SAVE AMERICA'S PASTIME ACT. WE'RE YOU KNOW BASEBALL SAID CERTAIN THINGS CAN'T BE DONE IT ADDED. IF YOU KNOW WILL WILL DESTROY THE LEAGUE IN AN NO WE MANAGED TO KEEP GOING. UP WITH TUMULTUOUS HISTORY. NOW WITH THE TIME TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT'S BEST FOR PLAYERS. AND REALLY AND OUR BALL CLUBS. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IN LIGHT OF ONGOING LITIGATION LET'S RECOGNIZING MINOR LEAGUERS AS EMPLOYEES. I WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND OF INDISCRETION WITH BOTH LABOR ENTRY TO SRI COMMITTEES ON AMENDMENTS- COMMITMENTS DURING THIS BILL DOES NOT. IN THE WAY OF ONGOING LITIGATION. AND ACCEPT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS LEGISLATION. EXPECT GRATITUDE TO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- IT MY CO AUTHOR AN ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOOTBALL AND HARD WORKING PLAYERS THAT SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR TRYING TO MAKE THEIR DREAMS COME TRUE. WITH A NUMBER OF WITNESSES TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER WILL GO AHEAD IN- SIR CALLING UPON THE WITNESSES AND- LET ME SEE I MAKE IT CALLED OUT- BECAUSE OF- COMPETING COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS HERE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR- YOUR STATEMENT- WITH REGARD TO. FUTURE MEMBERS TO BE TAKEN- TO BE CLEAR THERE'S NO MEMBERS ON THE TABLE TODAY OR NOTHING REALLY TO ACCEPT TODAY. PER SE- BUT- BUT YOUR COMMITMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO. TAKE A MEMBERS GOING FORWARD- IN YOU KNOW PART OF THE PROBLEM IS DOUBLE REFERRAL DEADLINE REALLY DIDN'T ALLOW US- A TO CREATE TIME IN A TO TAKE THOSE- THOSE MEMBERS HERE- MY UNDERSTANDING AND I HEARD YOU SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE LITIGATION BUT I WANT TO SIT IN IT IT IN- IN DIFFERENT WORDS. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR. OF ONE IS TO REMOVE THE BILL'S PROVISIONS FROM THE LABOR CODE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT SB TWELVE FORTY ITS AFFECT ON CURRENT APPLICATION OF LABOR PROTECTIONS. OF INTO IS TO ENSURE THAT SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT SCOPE REMAINS LIMITED TO MINOR LEAGUE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS. LENGTH THE LENGTH OF THOSE CONTRACTS AND GRANNY PLAYERS MORE FLEXIBILITY RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE USE OF THEIR INITIAL LIKENESS WITHIN THOSE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS- THOSE ARE WHAT OF OUR STAFF. UNDERSTANDS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TIME TO BE- THE MEMBERS THAT YOU WOULD BE PROCEEDING WITH INTRODUCED REYES IS THAT CORRECT YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN. AND OF COURSE THE CMMITTEE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REHEAR THE BILL- IF THE THOSE WOMEN'S HEART- COMPLETED. NOT THAT I EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ON THE RECORD- IN. TIME PERMITTING AND A MAKE SOME OTHER COMMENTS LATER AT I DIDN'T WANNA HAVE OF PEOPLE CORNER HILLS HERE IN TERMS OF TESTIMONY BUT I WANTED TO BE SURE WHAT WAS HERE AS- THE TEACHER THAT'S BEEN WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE TO GET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER- SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO- LEAD WITNESS- EDUARDO MARTINEZ THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DO YOU MIND MISTER MISTER PLEASE START WITH THE- WHEN THIS ON THE PHONE. THAT'S FINE THERE WILL BE- TREVOR HILDENBERGER- YES YEAH MISTER HOMER YOU CAN PROCEED WE CAN I THINK WE CAN HEAR YOU ALREADY- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. MY NAME IS TREVOR HILDENBERGER I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA BEFORE BEING DRAFTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HAVE UC BERKELEY WHERE I JUST GRADUATED AND WILL BE DRAFTED A REWARDED WITH HEFTY SIGNING BONUSES AND BONUSES A MERE FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE DOLLARS AFTER TAX. THE MONTHLY RATE FOR YOUR FIRST YEAR IS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. I CAME REQUIRED ALL PLAYERS TO THE LOWEST LEVEL TO LIVE IN THEIR TEAM PHONES DORMITORY. THE DORMS ARE SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A DAY TAKEN OUT OF OUR PAYCHECKS AND AT THE END OF EVERY TWO WEEKS MY PAY STUB READ. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS. DESPITE HAVING TO TRAIN YEAR ROUND THESE TINY PAYCHECKS STOP IN SEPTEMBER. I FOUND A JOB AT A SPORTING GOODS STORE IN ORDER TO FUND MY TRADING AGAIN PLEASE CLEAT BASEBALLS AND PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTS. I STILL CAN AFFORD RIGHT IN THE BAY AREA SO I MOVED BACK IN WITH MY PARENTS A LUXURY THAT NOT MANY PLAYERS HAVE. FINDING AFFORDABLE SHORT TERM HOUSING IS DIFFICULT FOR MANY OF MY INTERNATIONAL TEAM MATES WHO ARE YOUNG AND ENGLISH AS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE. LEADERS CAN BE ESPECIALLY INTIMIDATING AND TRICKY. SAVE ON COSTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I LIVED ON A PULL OUT COUCH IN A COCKROACH INFESTED APARTMENT WHERE HE SAYS I'VE BEEN ON WHICH SHIP THE BREAKER AND ALL THE LIGHTS WILL GO OUT. THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE MAKE DINNER IN THE DARK OR EAT WENDY'S IN THE LIGHT. AFTER THREE YEARS IN THE MINORS OF LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. WATCHING MY STUDENT LOANS ACCRUE INTEREST FASTER THAN I COULD PAY IT DOWN. AND THEN LIKE A BURDEN ON MY PARENTS AND GIRLFRIEND AT AGE TWENTY SIX. I STARTED HAVING THAT EFFECT. I LIVING MY CHILDHOOD DREAM BUT IT FELT LIKE A NIGHTMARE. BUT I REACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE MINOR LEAGUES I WAS PAID TWENTY THREE HUNDRED A MONTH. A COUPLE YEARS LATER I WAS RELEASED INTO FREE AGENCY AND A COMPETITIVE MARKET. THE ABILITY TO SIGN WITH ANY TEAM NOT JUST THE ONE ADOPTED ME. AND I SIGNED A CONTRACT FOR TWENTY NINE THOUSAND A MONTH. FROM 230-022-9000 FOR THE SAME JOB AT THE SAME LEVEL HOUSE MAKING TWELVE AND A HALF TIMES MORE. WE CAN FREE AGENCY AFTER FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF SEVEN WOULD ALLOW PLAYERS TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATED THE TALENTS. AND WE NEED SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE STRAIN MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER THAT FAMILIES HAVE OFFERED. THIS REASON I STRONGLY SUPPORT SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THINK YOUR TESTIMONY AND NOW WILL COME BACK TO COURT OVER TO THIS. AWESOME THANKS MISTER EDUARDO MARTINEZ FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FRAZIER FEDERATION. APPRENTICE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. I FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL ANTI TRUST EXEMPTIONS ALLOWING MLB OWNERS TO COLLUDE ON MINOR LEAGUE SALARIES IN A MANNER LIKE NO OTHER MAJOR EMPLOYER. THIS EXEMPTION HAS ALLOWED LEAGUE TO PAY MOST MINOR LEAGUERS LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND A YEAR. AND FOR THE COMMITTEES REFERENCE AN INDIVIDUAL CANNOT MEET BASIC NEEDS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY EARNING LESS THAN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND. THIS DISPARITIES ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE NEARLY HALF OF MINOR LEAGUERS WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR OR IMMIGRANTS. WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE SOCIAL FAMILIAR NETWORK TO LEAN ON. THERE'S SIMPLY NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT OF WORKERS OF ANY TYPE. LET A LOAN FROM AN INDUSTRY WITH RESOURCES SUCH AS MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. R. S. TWELVE FORTY WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO CORRECTING THESE LONG STANDING AND JUST AS- THAT MOST ATHLETES INCLUDING RECENTLY STUDENT ATHLETES CURRENTLY ENJOY. IT IS PATIENT FROM ARGUMENTS. FROM THE OPPOSITION IF I COULD LEAVE YOU WITH A QUOTE FROM A SPRING COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. WHO RULED AGAINST NC DOUBLE A WHO MADE SIMILAR ARGUMENTS ON THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. QUOTE NO WHERE ELSE IN AMERICA CAN BUSINESSES GET AWAY WITH AGREE NOT TO PAY THEIR WORKERS A FAIR MARKET RATE. ON THE THEORY THAT THEIR PRODUCT IS DEFINED BY NOT PAYING THEIR WORKERS A FAIR MARKET RATE. KEVIN KEVIN WENT ON TO SAY THE NC DOUBLE A MODEL VERY SIMILAR TO MLB'S. IS QUOTE SUPPRESSING THE PAY OF STUDENT ATHLETES WHO COLLECTIVELY GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUES FOR COLLEGES. EVERY YEAR. THOSE ENORMOUS SUMS OF MONEY FLOW TO SEEMINGLY EVERYONE. EXCEPT THE STUDENT ATHLETES. BUT THE STUDENT ATHLETES WHO GENERATE THE REVENUES. MANY OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND LOWER INCOME OF LOWER INCOME BACKGROUNDS. END UP WITH LITTLE OR NOTHING. WE COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER. YES WE ARE ABOUT. THANKS FOR TESTIMONY. WAS THERE ANYONE HERE THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS A SUPPORT POSITION ON SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT IF SO PLEASE SUPPORT. A C. NONE OF WILL GO TO THE MODERATOR MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE QUEUE UP ANY SUPPORT WITNESSES ON SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. LET ME KNOW THE NUMBER OF WITNESSES- AND THEN YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. M. FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT AN- AGAIN ONE ZERO FOUR SUPPORT. TO SECURE THE TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN Q. THANK YOU FOR CHECKING- WE'RE GONNA COME BACK NOW TO THE OPPOSITION SIDE OF THE LEDGER AND- WE DO HAVE TO READ OPPOSITION WITNESSES LISTED ONE OF SAN FERNANDO'S IN THE OTHERS CHECK THEIR- SAMPRAS WHO WANNA COME FORTH. POLICE- YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- ON BEHALF OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBS. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OPPOSITION OF- OF THE SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. GIVEN CENTER BAKER'S COMMITMENT TO WITHDRAW THE COMMENTS- REGARDING THE- THE BILL'S IMPACT ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT GOING TO DWELL ON THAT AS I INTENDED TO. BUT I WILL REMEMBER- REEMPHASIZED THE BILL WITH THOSE COMMENTS HAS THE DANGER OF IMPACTING EXIT- CURRENT LITIGATION THAT HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR EIGHT YEARS AND DEALS WITH EXACTLY THE TYPES OF ISSUES- THERE WOULD BE REYES. BY THIS BILL. ONE OF THEM IS THAT- THE TREATMENT OF MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS AS NON EXEMPT EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BRING INTO PLAY ALL SORTS OF- THINGS THAT. TEAMS AND PLAYERS NORMALLY DO NOT DO FOR EXAMPLE TAKING REST BREAKS AND MEAL BREAKS DURING THE COURSE OF THE GAME. THOSE ARE JUST ONE OF THE VERY MANY- THINGS THAT WOULD COME INTO PLAY IF THIS BILL WERE. ENACTED TO MAKE PLAYERS EXACT PLAYERS. I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE N. I. L. PROVISION- THIS BILL WOULD VOID ANY PROVISION IN A MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH THE PLAYERS RIGHT. TO USE THE PLAYER'S NAME IMAGE OR LIKENESS ALSO KNOWN AS AND I ALL RIGHT. THIS TOO IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING IN A MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT. I WAS A PLAYER OF HIS AND I ALL RIGHT. FOR A MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT GRANT EACH PLAYER'S CLUB THE RIGHTS THAT IT NEEDS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE TEAM AND THE PLAYER. THE CONTRACT ALSO GRANTS THE CLUB THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE OF PLAYERS USE OF HIS AND I ALL RIGHT. THIS APPROVAL PROCESS IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT A PLAYER WILL NOT AUTHORIZE THE USE OF THESE RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCT GROUP OR ACTIVITY. THAT COULD BE EMBARRASSING OR DETRIMENTAL TO THE PLAYER OR THE CLUB. THAT'S WHY EVEN MAJOR LEAGUE PLAYERS HAVE AGREED IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THE CLUB SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE APPROVE A PLAYER'S USE OF THEIR- RIGHTS FOR THE REASON I'VE DECIDED- WE OPPOSE SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JACK THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SAM MY NAME IS JACK PAYER- EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS. AND I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE FOR YOUR NATURE OF THE CONTRACT PROPOSAL- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT. OF COMPLEXITIES TO THIS LITIGATION- TO THIS THIS LEGISLATION AND THERE'S- THEY'RE BEING PLAYED OUT IN LITIGATION RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO MILEY COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS- SO. THE ISSUE OF MOVING FROM A SEVEN TO A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT. THIS PROVISION WOULD BE VERY HARMFUL TO CALIFORNIA BASED CLUBS A CALIFORNIA BASED PLAYERS IN MANY RESPECTS. IT CREATES A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES ARE FOR CALIFORNIA BASED CLUBS AND FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND FOR OF PLAYERS THAT PLAY FOR CALIFORNIA TEAMS. IT'S DIFFICULT TO OPERATE A LEAGUE WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CLUBS. FOR EXAMPLE OF A SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT VERSUS FOUR YEAR CONTRACT MANY MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS DO NOT MAKE THE MAJOR LEAGUES WITHIN THE FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH PLAYERS THAT ARE INTERNATIONAL OF THE CHOSEN FROM AN EARLY INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OR HAVE NOT ATTENDED COLLEGE IN UNITED STATES WHERE IT'S CUSTOMARY FOR PLAYERS TO SPEND MORE THAN FOUR YEARS IN THE MINOR LEAGUE SYSTEM BEFORE THEY MAKE THE MAJORS. AND SO IF YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA BASED CLUB. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT PLAYERS. IT'S A HUGE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE. LIKELY NOT TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR YEARS MEANS THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY FOCUS YOUR ENERGIES ON SIGNING COLLEGE PLAYERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN THE FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME AND THEREFORE CALIFORNIA BASED OF PLAYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE COLLEGE BASEBALL EXPERIENCE WILL BE GREATLY DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE NO CLUB WANT TO SIGN THAT PLAYER TO A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT KNOWING THAT THERE IS NOT LIKELY TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR YEARS. LIKE WAYS CALIFORNIA CLOSE WOULD NOT WANT TO SIGN FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS- FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND OTHER LOCATIONS AT AGE SEVENTEEN WHICH IS THE CURRENT RULES- KNOWING THAT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO MAKE THE MAJORS- IN TIME AS WELL. IF YOU'RE A CALIFORNIA BASED PLAYER AND YOU CAN ONLY SIGN A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT OTHER TEAMS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO BE RELUCTANT TO SIGN YOU AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE WHETHER YOU'LL MAKE IT WITHIN FOUR YEARS AND YOUR SIGNING BONUSES WILL BE AFFECTED- RIGHT NOW THE AVERAGE MAJOR LEAGUE MEMBERS MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER HAS A SIGNING BONUS OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND. DOLLARS WHEN THEY SIGN THEIR INITIAL CONTRACT WITH MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL- AND THAT DOLLARS CAN BE AFFECTED BY. THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. AND WITH RESPECT TO A CALIFORNIA CLUB WE WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH OUR TEAMS FROM OTHER STATES. WANT TO PUT A WINNING TEAM ON THE FIELD. AND IF WE CAN ONLY SIGN COLLEGE PLAYERS. THEN THE 40% OF THE MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS THAT ARE FOREIGN BORN. AND MANY PLAYERS WHO PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND DON'T PLAYING COLLEGE WOULD BE SOMEWHAT OFF LIMITS TO US AT THAT WE CAN'T. BE SURE THAT THEY COULD MAKE IT IN TIME AND SO WE WOULD BE SIGNING FROM A LIMITED POOL PLAYERS IN CALIFORNIA PUTTING IT IS ALSO A HUGE COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IS VIA THE OTHER TEAMS AND THE CALIFORNIA'S PLAYERS WERE ALSO PIECE THAT DISADVANTAGE IN THAT THEY WOULD BE LESS MARKETABLE. AND FINALLY WE WOULD BE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TRADING A PLAYER- THAT'S A MINOR LEAGUE PLAYER WHICH HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. IF THEY HAVE A LIMITED CONTRACT LEFT- BECAUSE THAT PLAYER WOULD BE OF LESS VALUE THAN A PLAYER. FOR US OF THAT PLACE ROUTINE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS A LONGER CONTRACT LENGTH. THE TO SUM UP OBVIOUSLY THIS IS IN LITIGATION THIS IS COMPLICATED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT- THAT PROCESS SHOULD BE RESPECTED. AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER BEAR- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION OF TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. HELLO MY NAME IS OSCAR SORIA KNOWN AS A COLLEGE STUDENT ATHLETE I STRONGLY OPPOSES BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEN NO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO IT SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCE ORVIS. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT WILL BE CAN'T. ANALYST JOHN ON THE PHONE LINE IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE SP TWELVE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO ONE IN OUR QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BETTER IF YOU WOULD PLEASE CHECK LINES ONE MORE TIME JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. ABSOLUTELY ONCE AGAIN IN OPPOSITION TO I'M SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. IN ONE ZERO FOR OPPOSITION. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN OUR QUEUE THANK YOU MR MODERATOR IF YOU- AND THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES HERE TODAY WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. I'M AS MUCH AS I ADORE AND LOVE BASEBALL OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW ALL THE RULES AND ALL THE DYNAMICS THAT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME I JUST LIKE TO GO TO THE STADIUM AND CHEER FOR MY TEAM IN. LOS ANGELES- BUT I DO HAVE YOU KNOW SOME QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF THAT IT DOES HAVE SOME REAL BASIC QUESTIONS. ON ON THE LITIGATION THAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO. FROM DOES THE LITIGATION COVER ALL OF THE ISSUES. THAT ARE IN PLAY HERE- WITH THIS LEGISLATION OR WAS IT JUST ON THE ISSUE OF- ON EMPLOYEE STATUS OR LABOR. CODE YES THE LITIGATION IS JUST ON THE EMPLOYEE STATUS IN THE COMPENSATION PIECE THAT'S OR TAKING THAT PART OUT IT DOESN'T REFER TO THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT OR THE AND I L. PORTION WE'RE TAKING THAT. THE READING THAT PART OF IT OUT BUT WE'RE KEEPING IN THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. AND THE AND I'LL- OKAY OKAY BECAUSE I THAT WAS RAISED BY. YEAH THE OPPOSITION SO THE LITIGATION ISSUE IS NOT AN ISSUE ANYMORE YES WE'VE COMMITTED TO IF YOU'RE- YEAH IF THAT WORKS OUT YEAH- THE SECOND THING IS IF. I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FOUR YEAR AND THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT THE FOUR YEAR AND THE SEVENTH YEAR- SOME REFERENCE WAS MADE BY MR. BEAR AS TO THE DISADVANTAGES TO OF FOREIGN BORN AND HIGH SCHOOL- I GUESS HIGH SCHOOL- PLAYERS ARE RECENTLY GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS- WHAT WHY IS THAT. A DISADVANTAGE FOR THOSE GROUPS AND THEY- ADD UP 240% YEAH THE LEGISLATURE PRINTERS REALLY TO THIS FINISH TO TEAMS IN RECRUITING THOSE PLAYERS. BECAUSE THEY'RE OFTEN- HI YOU KNOW AT A YOUNGER AGE RIGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOLER WHO'S YOU KNOW SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN OR A KID FOR ANOTHER COUNTRY WHOSE THAT AGE. AND THEREFORE THEY'RE SAYING. THAT YOU KNOW FOR YEARSIS NOT ENOUGH TO EVALUATE SOME OF THAT YOUNG WHEREAS AGAIN WOULD AGREE SOMEONE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE- FOUR YEARS IS PROBABLY AN APPROPRIATE TIME AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO I DON'T THINK HE'S SAYING THAT IT'S A DISADVANTAGE TO. THOSE FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS HE'S I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT IS FOR CHARACTERIZE IT THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IT'S A DISTURBING CALIFORNIA TEAMS- BECAUSE- THEY- THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE FOUR YEARS TO EVALUATE THOSE PLAYERS THAT THEY SIGNED A YOUNG AGE WHERE'S OTHER TEAMS WOULD HAVE. SEVEN YEARS TO- BUT I'LL WAIT AT AT A- THOSE TEAMS A YOUNGER AGE AND I GUESS JUST TO CUT TO THE CHASE I MEAN OUR OUR POSITION ON THAT. ISSUE IS JUST THAT- A WITCH THING IF FORTY WE WEEKLY FOR YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH TO EVALUATE A PLAYER I CERTAINLY PARTICULARLY THOSE YOU KNOW COLLEGE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE BUT WE LEAVE IN GENERAL FOR YEARS IS LONG ENOUGH. AND. THEY CAN THEN ARE WE SIGN. THIS TO INTO COST. AND THERE ARE EVEN OTHER LEAKS THAT HAVE A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL YOU CAN EVEN PUT IN SAY RIGHT FIRST REFUSAL. SAID IF SOMEBODY OFFERS- THAT PLAYER A BIG SALARY YOU CAN STILL MATCH IT AND RETAIN THEIR RIGHTS. SO NOBODY SAYING YOU CAN STILL SIGN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS BUT AFTER WERE YOU MEAN THROUGH ANOTHER THREE YEARS. BUT AFTER FOUR YEARS THEY WOULD THEN BE A FREE AGENT- JUST AS THE OUR AS OUR WITNESS WAS A FREE AGENT AFTER SEVEN YEARS AS A OF A SIGN OF MUCH. BETTER CONTRACT WHILE STILL- BUT STILL OCCUPY THE SAME ROLE IN THE MINOR LEAGUES. SO OUR CONTRACTS. EXACTLY FOR SEVEN YEARS OR IS IT UP TO SEVEN YEARS. GOING TO BE LESS THAN SEVEN YEARS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY. SIGNERS EVERYONE OKAY SO IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO. GO AHEAD SPEAKER. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE POINT AND IT'S NOT ONLY DISADVANTAGE TO THE CLUBS. WHO WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SIGN PLAYERS FOR FOUR YEARS AND THEREFORE MIGHT NOT WANT TO INVEST IN A PLAYER THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE IT WITHIN FOUR YEARS- OF FOREIGN BORN PLAYER I SCHOOL PLAYER. BUT IT'S ALSO A DISADVANTAGE TO THOSE PLAYERS THEMSELVES. WHO CAN ONLY SIGN A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT SO. IF YOU'RE THE ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS OR THE NEW YORK YANKEES. AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN A PLAYER THAT YOU CAN SIGN FOR SEVEN YEARS OR PLAYER YOU COULD ONLY SIGN FOR FOUR YEARS. YOU'RE GONNA CHOOSE THE PLAYER THAT YOU CAN SIGN FOR SEVEN YEARS SO THE PLAYERS WILL HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITY IF THEY COME FROM CALIFORNIA. THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY CAME FROM OTHER STATES. SO THIS WOULD DISADVANTAGED BUT ONLY THE CLUB'S ABILITY TO COMPETE WIH TEAMS OUT OF CALIFORNIA. BUT ALL THE PLAYERS WHO STAND TO BE SIGNED. THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO PLAY PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL WILL BE A DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE. OF THE OLDER PEERS FROM OTHER STATES. THE I WANT TO GIVE IT TO QUIT. OBVIOUSLY WE BELIEVE THAT BUT NOW BE THE CASE OF A- AT PLAYER HAS PROMISED AND THEY HAVE FOR YEARS- TO LOCK THEM UP IN MAYBE A RIGHT. OF REFUSAL AFTER THAT- WE THINK TEAMS WOULD STILL GO AHEAD SIGNED THOSE PLAYERS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT 40% OF THE MINOR. LEAGUE PLAYERS. ARE FOREIGN BORN KEPT LIQUOR. SORRY THAT'S OKAY MISTER BERRY ANDERSON. MOST OF US ARE VERY NEW TO THE AREA TO THEIR OF. RULES AND REGULATIONS HERE AND IN THE COMMITTEE- BUT GIVE ME ONE SECOND- SENATOR- DOORS IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. WELL I WAS TRYING TO GET CLARITY I'M SORRY. I WAS AND I MEAN TO. TAKE OVER THE CONVERSATION HERE BUT- JUST TO GET CLARITY AS TO. WHO'S DISADVANTAGED AND WIDER DISADVANTAGING HOW THE FOUR YEAR AND SEVEN YEAR. FIT INTO THAT- THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MAIN. QUESTION BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT A DISADVANTAGE OF PLAYERS. A WE WANT TO. GIVE THEM THE MOST LEVERAGE THEY CAN USE BASED ON THEIR SKILLS. WE WANT THEM TO GET THE BEST DEAL WE WANT THEM TO. SOONER THAN LATER RIGHT- MAKE MORE MONEY- AS WELL AS LOVE THEIR- CAREER. SOME I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS. SO IT IS RIGHT NOW MAKE YOUR THE CONTENTION OF. THIS BILL AND- THE ALL THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. THAT MAKING A HAVING A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT RATHER SEVEN WOULD GIVE THAT LEVERAGE RIGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE WITNESS WHO TESTIFIED- THAT WAS. YOU KNOW WE HAD TO WAIT TILL AFTER SEVEN YEARS- THAN DOING PERFORMING THE SAME JOB. TO GET A TWELVE TIMES HIGHER SALARY. AND SO PRESUMABLY AFTER FOUR YEARS- THAT. ARE FOR A WITNESS- WOULD BE A MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENT. COULD HAVE GOTTEN A MUCH HIGHER SALARY AT THAT TIME. YEAH SO I THINK YOU KNOW A CLEARLY- I MEAN WHOLE PREMISE OF FREE AGENCY IS THAT. RIGHT IS THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PLAYERS TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO GO AND NEGOTIATE. AND THAT'S REALLY THAT THE PREMISE I DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THE CONTENTION IS THAT. THAT WOULD MAKE YOU- TEAM LESS LIKELY TO SIGN A YOUNG PLAYERBECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE BEEN FOR FOUR YEARS AND IF THEY MIGHT NOT SIGN THEM. AND I THINK THE REALITY IS WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW PLAYERS WITH PROMISES ARE GOING TO GET SIDE- AND FOR YOU TO GET THERE YOU FOUR YEARS TO VALUATE AND AFTER THAT. YOU CAN STILL SIGN THEM YOU KNOW IT IN UNDER OF OUR BILL PASSES YOU FOR YEARS TO EVALUATE. AND IF THE GREAT AND YOU WANT TO SIGN OF LONGER THAN YOU CAN SIGN LONGER. RIGHT AND AGAIN MOB COULD EVEN PUT A PROVISION THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL SOMEBODY ELSE OFFERS THEM A MUCH BIGGER DEAL YOU CAN MATCH THAT- AND- AND WHY BEING. I'M SORRY TO SWIM. WHY BEING FOREIGN BORN WHY IS THAT A DISADVANTAGE- I DON'T THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS IS VANISHING THE SCOUTING AND- IN THESE COUNTRIES IS QUITE ADVANCED AND DEVELOPED AGAIN I THINK THE CONTENTION WOULD BE IF YOU ONLY FOUR YEARS YO'RE GOT WE ARE LESS LIKELY TO SIGN. A FORM FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE YOU KNOW GENERALLY YOUNGER PLAYER THAN YOU WOULD SAY A KID COMING OUT OF COLLEGE IN THE US THAT'S THE CONTENTION YOU KNOW. BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY SHOWN THE KID OUT OF COLLEGE IS ALREADY SHOWN TO IT JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN- YEAH THAT THEY'RE OLDER AND YOU'VE MORE YOU KNOW MORE. A MORE BODY WORK TO EVALUATE THEM ON. SO THE CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT. YOU pLIKELY TO SIGN SOMEONE- THE FOREIGN BORN PLAYER. THAT YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE LESS TIME TO EVALUATE. THE SENATE ADDRESS- WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM THE- FROM THE WEST WITNESS. MR WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND YES- FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS ARE SIGNED AND START PLAYING AT AGE SEVENTEEN. THEY TYPICALLY PLAY THREE YEARS OVERSEAS- IN THE ACADEMIES IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC- AND THEN THEY MATRICULATED UNITED STATES AND THEY BEGIN THEIR CAREER IN UNITED STATES AND SO IT'S VERY RARE FOR A FOREIGN BORN PLAYER TO MAKE THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR YEARS. SO THE ISSUE IS IF YOU'RE UNLIKELY TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THE PLAYER MAKING THE MAJORS WITHIN FOUR YEARS WOULD YOU SIGN INVEST IN THAT PLAYER. ARMED AND ALL OTHER TEAMS OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THE TWENTY FIVE OTHER MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIGN A PLAYER FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THEREFORE THEY'RE GOING TO SIGN PLAYERS THAT ARE FOREIGN BORN AT A HIGHER CLIP THAN WE WOULD. AND WITH 40% OF THE MINOR LEAGUERS BEING FOREIGN BORN IF WE CANNOT COMPETE IN THAT MARKETPLACE CALIFORNIA CLUBS ARE EXTREMELY DISADVANTAGED. WELL I I'D HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY YEARS HE PLAYED IN THE MINORS. SENATOR ALSO THE CENTENARY. HELLO ARE YOU OK YES SHE SAID GO AHEAD SAID EARLIER THANK YOU I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON THIS WAS BOTH OF YOU WITH THE QUESTION IT AND FIRST CAN I JUST ASK YOU KNOW THESE AMENDMENTS DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY TODAY SO WHAT ME BE REALLY CLEAR IT TAKES EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR BILL BUT THE CONTRACT LENGTH AND- THE NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS LEFT IN THE BILL YEAH. OKAY THE END I WANNA CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING FROM CENTER DRAWS BECAUSE USE YOUR PRESUMPTION IS THAT IF SOMEBODY'S CONTRACT AND SAID FOR YEARS THAN THEIR NEGOTIATING FROM STRENGTH THAT THAT WAS THE PRESUMPTION. WHAT WHY IS THAT THE PRESUMPTION. WELL CURRENTLY IF THEY DON'T WANT THE TEAM DOESN'T WANT THAT PLAYER WILL JUST CUT THEM RIGHT SO THAT THE OF THE WHOLE PREMISE IS THAT AFTER FOUR YEARS THAT YOU ARE YOU SEEN AS HAVING PROMISED SOMEWHERE YOU'RE NOT SEEN HOUSING PROMISE SOMEWHERE THE PLAN I CAN KEEP YOU AROUND ANYWAY IF YOU ARE SEEN AS HAVING PROMISED SOMEWHERE THEN SOMEBODY COULD SIGN BUT IT FORCES THAT ISSUE IN A WAY THAT. SOMEBODY COULD CONTINUE PLAYING UP UNTIL SEVEN YEARS AND NOT HAVE THE ISSUE FORCED AND MAKE IT AND THIS FORCES A TEAM TO DECIDE AFTER FOR WHEN THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO IT. RIGHT I DON'T. NO I THINK IF THE CONTENTIOUS SOMEHOW THIS HARMS PLAYERS BECAUSE- THEY HAVE A RIGHT FOR YEARS. I JUST DON'T THINK IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT- CONTENTION HOLDS UP. WELL LET ME ASK- MISTER BEAR BECAUSE SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE NAME OF% SOMEBODY THAT FITS THIS AND SO I NEED SOMEBODY YOU WOULD KNOW. SO IF PUBLISHED SUNDAY VALL. CAME UP TO THE MAJORS. AFTER FOUR YEARS WHICH I THINK HE WAS IN THE MINORS FOR LONGER THAN THAT HOW WOULD HE FIT IN THIS DISCUSSION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL UNDER UNDER THIS SITUATION THE GIANTS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SIGN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE TO A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT BECAUSE HE WAS A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD PLAYER INTERNATIONALLY. AND HE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE MAJORS HE SIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO WE MADE THE MAJORS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. SO AFTER FOUR YEARS THEN HE WOULD A FREE AGENT AT ANY TIME ANY TEAM COULD SIGN HIM. US WE'D BE COMPETING AGAINST THE TWENTY NINE OTHER CLUBS. OF FOR HIS SERVICES SO. YOU KNOW IN THAT SITUATION. PUBLIC SANDOVAL MIGHT IT NOT HAVE BEEN A GIANT IF THIS LEGISLATION PASSES WOOD. THE- THE OTHER PIECES IS WOULD. YOU WITH WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM WOULD HE HAVE THE LEVERAGE TO HAVE CONTINUED AFTER FOUR YEARS C. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. THIS MOVES AHEAD AND SETS A MORE ARBITRARY THING. AND I HAVEN'T DETERMINED THAT THAT'S TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PLAYERS THAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT THAT WITH THIS. I MEAN YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE MINERS THIS IS THAT YOUR CONTENTION. RIGHT MY CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT HE WOULD BEEN SIGNED BY TEAM OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TO A SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT WHICH FITS THE DEVELOPMENT CYCLE BETTER FOR AN INTERNATIONAL PLAYER. OF IF FORCED TO SIGN A PLAYER FOR A FOUR YEAR CONTRACT. IT MAKES IT HARDER TO SIGN INTERNATIONAL PLAYERS. AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT PLAYER IS AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS. WHETHER THEY'RE A PROSPECT OR NOT THEY MAY WELL BE A PROSPECT. THEY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO SIGN WITH ANOTHER TEAM. AND NOT. THE GIANTS IN A RELATED GEN I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE BETTER CITY. TO THE- HIS ROOM IF W HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES. IS THERE PRESSURE ANOTHER TEAMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CALIFORNIA'S RULES IF THEY'RE DEFERRED AND DISADVANTAGED EITHER PLAYERS OR TEAMS AND IF BECAUSE- ORIGINALLY. WHEN I READ THE ANNOUNCES THAT SAYS ANY THIS APPLIES TO ANY TEAM THAT PLAYS IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. THIS WOULD APPLY TO ANY TEAM FROM ANOTHER STATE JUST PLAY HERE RIGHT IS THAT CORRECT THEM. BECAUSE THE THAT SAID THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE ANALYSIS- I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY MORE TOWARDS THE A COMPENSATION OF PIECES SO IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT IT WOULD BE- THERE'S LIVING HERE TEAMS BASED HERE. THANKS I WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THIS DISADVANTAGES CALIFORNIA. WELL I THINK CERTAINLY THAT CONTENTION WOULD BE YEAH THAT THAT WAS THE CONTENTION MADE- AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE REALLY HAVE TO SAY AND SAVE- YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE BELIEVE DO WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SAY. YEAH WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PAYING THESE POVERTY WAGES BECAUSE OF- THE CHANCE THAT MIGHT THAT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T SIGN THESE PLAYERS FOR THREE MORE YEARS RIGHT. OUR POINT IS YOU CAN SEND ESPECIALLY MORE YEARS YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY THEM A HIGHER SALARY. BUT YOU COULD IF YOU WANT TO LOCK THEM UP FOR SEVEN YEARS YOU CAN SELECT SOME OF FOR SEVEN YEARS. YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER SALARY- SO- THEN WHY DO A CONTRACT FOR FOUR YEARS IF YOU CAN STILL DO THAT. BECAUSE THE POINT IS AFTER FOUR YEARS BECAUSE WAY AND GET THE WHOLE REASON FOR DOING THIS IS YOU YOU HER FOR THE WITNESSES THE WAGES THAT ARE BEING PAID RIGHT NOW. AND AND SO- AFTER FOUR YEARS AGAIN HE YOU KNOW THE CAN YOU HEAR THE WITH US RIGHT SO IN YOUR EIGHT YEARS DOING THE EXACT SAME JOB MAKING TWELVE TIMES AS MUCH. RIGHT TO OUR POINT IS YES AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU CAN BE DOING THE EXACT SAME JOB MAKING TWELVE TIMES AS MUCH. BUT THAT PRESUMES THAT THERE'S ADVANTAGE TO THE PLAYER THAT THE PLAYERS GOOD ENOUGH IN EVERY INSTANCE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AS OPPOSED TO. VOTE MOVING IT UP AND BEING MORE ARBITRARY MOVING IT UP FORCES PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT AVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF THE SYSTEM ANOTHERWAY AND IF IT IS IN FACT FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS. THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN THAT CATEGORY THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING YEAH I DO THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT THIS NOTION THAT SOMEHOW IT'S GONNA BE FORCED OUT IT JUST DOESN'T. IT JUSTDOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO JIM I'M NOT NO BUT I MEAN I MEAN. IT TOOK TO JUST I AM PLAYER. AFTER FOUR YEAR. RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW. FOR MAKING THOUSAND HOURS A WEEK I KEEP MAKING THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK. IN ORDER LEGISLATION YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. WITH UP WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF TEAMS. IF NOBODY WANTS TO SIGN A AND MY BEST OPTIONS STAY FOR THE CURRENT TEAM MAKING A THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK. I'M GONNA SAY FOR THE CURRENT TEAM MAKING THOUSAND HOURS A WEEK. SO NOBODY IS BEING FORCED OUT JUST GIVE ME THE OPTION NOW TO NEGOTIATE. A HIGHER SALARY IF PEOPLE WANT ME. MADHU KHANNA. BECAUSE AS AS NOT TO READ THAT I GOT OF THE SITUATION IF IT'S ENACTED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THERE CAN'T BE A CONTRACT MORE THAN FOUR YEARS. SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHETHER TO BRING A PLAYER TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES WITHIN FOUR YEARS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS AND WHETHER THEY'RE READY TO BE. A MATRICULATED TO THE BIG LEAGUES- SO IT AFFECTS HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS IT AFFECTS. FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS THAT ARE SIGNED AT A YOUNGER AGE. COLLEGE PLAYERS THAT ARE SIGNED. OLDER THEY HAVE MORE BASEBALL EXPERIENCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BE A VALUED WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME. UNDER UNDER THIS SCENARIO TWENTY FIVE MAJOR LEAGUE CLUBS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD SIGNED. SEVEN YEARS. AND HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE PLAYERS. AND TRADE PLAYERS- AND BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE THAN THE CALIFORNIA BASED CLUBS THAT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. ON PLAYERS. IN MANY CASES WELL BEFORE THAT DECISION IS RIGHT. SO I JUST NEED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IF THAT'S NOT CORRECT. THE BILL RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENTS ARE PEOPLE WHO LAST AND MY LEASE MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE MAJORS. IN FOR YOUR STARBUCKS. YOU CAN STILL BE A MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENT JUST AS A MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENT TODAY. WHICH IS A I BELIEVE. THIS WOULD BE AT. AFTER FOUR YEARS RATHER MINOR LEAGUE FREE AGENCY AFTER SEVEN YEARS. SO WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU HAVE. CUT POP POP AND ROCK WERE PROMOTED TO THE MAJORS. WE'RE JUST SAYING HEY. IF YOU KNOW THE MARINERS HAVE BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR FOUR YEARS AND- THEY WENT OFF A- FIRE DEAL. THEY GOT FOR HER DEAL. THE GIANTS COULD STILL MATCH THAT AT WORK BEAT THAT DEAL- BUT NOT SAYING YOU GOT FROM A SOMEBODY REMARKS. STILL MORE. FOR THE REASON I VALID FOR TRY TO THE ROUGH YOU YES I WAS STILL GOING BACK THE PREMISE AND I THINK YOU. DRESSING SOMETHING ELSE. BECAUSE THE PREMISES. THERE'S TWO HERE. ONE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'D BE SIGNED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT FOUR YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS. IF THEY'RE NOT SIGNED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO FOR YEARS OR THERE IS NO SEVEN YEARS. BUT THE REAL THING. IS THERE'S A PRESUMPTION. THAT PABLO SANDOVAL. FOR THE WITNESS THAT TESTIFIED. WOULD AT FOUR YEARS BE ENTITLED TO THAT OR RECOGNIZED AS A GOOD PLAYER AND BE ENTITLED TO THAT. THAT BETTER SALARY. A. N. AND THE THING I'M TRYING TO GET AT. IS WHETHER MOVING TO FREE AGENCY MOVES. SYSTEM A BIT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LEVERAGE ARE PERCEIVED TO BE GOOD ENOUGH. A CHECK. CHIU SOONER IN A WAY THAT IS NOT TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PLAYERS YEAH I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING I'M TRYING TO ANSWER IT WHICH IS STATE. THAT YOU WOULD BE SAYING. LET'S LOCK EVERY PLAYER INTO POVERTY WAGES FOR AN EXTRA THREE YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE EDGE CASE OF SOMEBODY IN THE BORDERLINE WHO'S POSSIBLY DISADVANTAGE AND I'M SAYING. THAT PERSON WOULD BE DISADVANTAGED RIGHT BECAUSE pFREE AGENT SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO OFFER YOU MORE MONEY. THEN YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU MIGHT SAY HEY ONE SERVICE ORGANIZATION. I WANT TO STAY WITH HER EXIST FOR THE SAME AMOUNT. BUT IF NO ONE OFFERS YOU MORE MONEY. THEN YOU'RE NO WORSE OFF YOU CAN STILL STAY WITH THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION- THAT YOU EFFORTS TO ME THAT THEY WANT TO PAY YOU. IF THEY'RE SIGNED IN THE FIRST PLACE. IF THEY'RE SIGNED A FIRST PLACE YEP. BUT YET AGAIN THEN YOU'RE NOT DISMISSING ANY PLAYERS THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU JUST VANISHING CALIFORNIA TEENS. NINE ONE. WHAT MADE. IT IN CRAFTING THE BILL WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE SEVEN YEARS AND FOR I MEAN FOR YEARS AS OPPOSED TO SEVEN. WHAT WHAT AND WHAT WAS THE BENCHMARK FOR DOING WELL BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT FOR IT WE HAD TO MAKE A CALL BUT WE LIVE FOUR YEARS IS SUFFICIENT TO EVALUATE- A PLAYER. AND SEVEN YEARS I WAS IN THE CURRENT WEB RIGHT NOW. BUT AGAIN JUST. PHYSICALLY SIGN A PLAYER TO SEVEN YEARS YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED. TO KEEP THAT PLAY FOR SEVEN YEARS PLAYERS GET CUT ALL THE TIME. RIGHT SO THAT'S WHY IT IS NOTION THAT. THEIR SERVICE EDUCATE FOR SOME IS DISADVANTAGED. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT EDUCATE SUCCESS. UN BUT THE- YEAH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMMITTED TO KEEP SOMEONE FOR SEVEN YEARS SO NOT. YOUR IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED. YOU KNOW SAY SEVEN YEAR- EMPLOYMENT- SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. IT WILL BE DISADVANTAGING PLAY. THE QUESTION ARE YOU DISADVANTAGING CALIFORNIA TEENS. AND YOU KNOW A HERE IS LIKE I THINK IT'S UPON US THE SURVEY DECISION ARE WE GOING TO. STAND UP FOR WORKERS AND- THE WAY. I DID CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY I THINK TO ME BASED GONNA HAVE TO ADJUST. THIS IS IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE TO ADJUST IN IN OTHER WAYS AROUND COMPENSATION OTHER THINGS- JUST AS WE FOR SAID IN MANY OTHER. YOU KNOW WITH MANY OTHER PLACES WHERE CALIFORNIA'S MOVE FIRST AND WE'VE MADE AND- THE REST OF COUNTRIES CAUGHT UP TO US AT YOU KNOW FUEL ECONOMY WAIVERS OR OTHER THINGS. I THINK THAT WERE BIG ENOUGH- THAT THE SOLUTION WILL BE FOUND AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW NOT TO GO SHE MAYBE SOME TEACHERS WOULD MAYBE- YOU KNOW- MAYBE THEY WANT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. ALONG YOU KNOW FOR SURE. BUT FOR PLAYERS COMING OUT OF COLLEGE BUT- THE REALITIES RIGHT NOW YOU CAN BE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YOU ARE LOCKED UP FOR SEVEN YEARS. AT THE WHICH IS- THAT THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN ON JUST READ THOSE TO YOU JUST TO BE YOU KNOW NOW IT'S ON THE RECORD BUT LET ME IF I CAN DO ONE FOLLOW UP ON THE SUBJECT. HE I JUST GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO COMMENT ON. WHAT WAS JUST SAID. WELL THERE THERE IS ANOTHER. HERE THERE'S A RULE FIVE DRAFT FOR PLAYERS WITH FOUR YEARS OF MINOR LEAGUE SERVICE THAT ANOTHER TEAM CAN. SELECT THEM- AND TAKE THEM ONTO THEIR TEAM IF THEY ARE AT THE MAJOR LEAGUE LEVEL S. IF A PLAYER IS- AT THE OF THE- HAS THE ABILITY TO JUMP TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM- IF THEIR CLUB IS. IS HOLDING THEM BACK PEOPLE OF. AND SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH MENTIONING THAT- SO AND THEN JUST TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND PLAYERS IN THE LITIGATION THAT'S ONGOING OR DRESSING COMPENSATION ISSUES AND BENEFIT ISSUES- AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL BE PRODUCTIVE I AND- THE MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS AND THE LEAKS WILL HAVE- MODIFIED RUSHING. IN IF THERE IS THE COMPENSATION ISSUES AND BENEFITS ADDRESSED IN THIS LITIGATION. IT WOULD AFFECT WHAT THEY'RE PAID WHETHER IT'S FOUR YEARS OR SEVEN YES OKAY SO THAT WOULD ITS ONGOING LITIGATION THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING NOW I DON'T WANT TO PRE JUDGE THEM- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE SHOULD. BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED- AND SO I AM THANKFUL THAT THE AUTHOR HAS. NOT ADDED TO THAT WOMAN ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE IN READING ANALYSIS AND TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE WAY HERE THE IT SEEMS AND THE WITNESS EVEN- BOB MENTIONED IT WHETHER IT'S HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PART OF THE JOB. THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY INCLUDED IN COMPENSATION IS THAT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IT STE BY ORGANIZED BASEBALL DEAD THE DEAD THAT THE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS SHOULD BE REALLY CLEAR RATHER THAN IT BE OFF TO THE SIDE IN SOME WAY. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAWSUIT- WILL MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL HAS- MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL'S ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE SO THERE'S NO HOUSING SUBSIDIES FOR THE PLAYERS- AND THERE'S FOOD- TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH THAT'S ALL PART. OF THE BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT THE PLAYERS HAVE AS WELL AS HEALTH INSURANCE ABOUT ALL OF THESE ITEMS ARE PART OF THE LITIGATION YES MA'AM. IN. THE END WE- CLOSE OUR- OUR GONNA CHIU THIS. THE AB RIGHT WHICH I THINK GIVES OUR WITNESS WE HAVE TREVOR SPEAK ON. ON A SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS TO ABOUT FOUR YEARS FOR SEVEN YEARS IF HE THINKS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISADVANTAGED. BY BY- I THINK HE I'M NOT SURE THAT'S- THE YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE EVERY SINGLE PLAYER. I TESTIFY I THINK IT'S A MORE GENERIC QUESTION THAT THAN THE INDIVIDUAL ONE I WANT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT. TWENTY NINE NO I BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS THE NAME IN IT IMAGE AND LIKENESS. IN DIRT THE THING THAT WAS RAISED IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND I WANT YOU TO SPEAK TO IT. IT IS THAT. A TEAM LOSES CONTROL OF- THE WHAT A PLAYER MIGHT SAY ABOUT THE CLUB OR THE GAME IF IT'S INDEPENDENT HOW. WOULD THIS BILL ADDRESS THAT ARE NOT ADDRESS THAT. YES A- WE FEEL THAT'S- PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOU AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED AT PLAYERS AND OWNERS VIA THE UPC IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN CAN BE ENDORSED I'M JUSTWITH THE NCAA RIGHT D. THAT PLAYERS HAVE AN IMAGE LIKENESS WE DON'T LET PLAYERS- GO AND ENDORSE YOU KNOW CIGARETTES OR OTHER THINGS RIGHT SO- THE ADMISSION OF YOUR QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT SORT OF LIKE I THINK WHAT I HEARD. IS THAT THE TEAMS FEEL LIKE THEY LOSE CONTROL OF THE MESSAGE IS THERE A WAY WITHIN YOUR BILL THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT THEY HAVE TO GET REWARDED FOR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS YES AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS DOCUMENTED AND THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE NEGOTIATE JUST OTHER PLACES RIGHT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT HARMS A MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. I MEAN IT'S NOT REQUIRED IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD NEGOTIATE ON EVERY SITUATION YES AND I WOULD PREFER TO- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN THE BILL YES- IT ACCORDING TO. THE PEOPLE THAT WE'VE TALKED TO- AROUND US IT'S REALLY ABOUT MAKING CAN SO WE TOOK A VIDEO GAME EXAMPLE WHERE THEY CURRENTLY DO NOT GET COMPENSATED FOR THAT- BUT THE OTHER PIECE. EXACT MECHANICS AKIN TO THE EXACT MECHANICS HERE- FOR THIS PURPOSE OF THIS DISCUSSION THERE ARE MECHANICS TO MAKE SURE THAT- YOU CAN'T SAY NEGOTIATE FOR CIGARETTES OR YOU CAN'T DO SUPPORT FOR GAMBLING I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ARE YOU SAYING THAT THAT YOU HAVE IT NOW THIS IS PROHIBITED NOW REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS ARTS WITHOUT CHANGE THAT YEAH. WHAT BUT IT. HE IT FOR HIM NOW AND YOUR THAT THIS BILL NOT CHANGE. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I BELIEVE IT IS PROHIBITED NOW AND I DON'T BELIEVE OUR BILL CHANGE YES. ONE OFFICER TO WALKING TO THE MICHAEL ASK YOU TO COMMENT CENTER ARMS- SAN FERNANDO. EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE DODGERS. AND THAT THE THING ABOUT THIS BILL AND JUST WHO. I'M SORRY WHO THE DODGERS I WAS ASKING ON BEHALF OF SENATOR DRAWS. YEAH. THE THING ABOUT THE BILL THAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT IT HAS ONE PROVISION THAT IS ALL ENCOMPASSING AND USES THE WORD INTERFERES. A CONTRACT CANNOT IT THE BILL ACTUALLY SAYS A CONTRACT CANNOT HAVE A PROVISION THAT INTERFERES WITH THE PLAYER'S. NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS RIGHT. THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT INTERFERES MEANS THE BILL THAT PURPORTS TO GO ON TO GIVE THE CLUB SOME SORT OF. RIGHT THAT IS A VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT YOU KNOW CONFLICTS BETWEEN WHAT THE PLAYERS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE CLUBS TRYING TO DO. THAT IS BY THE WAY BY A MUCH BROADER WAY MUCH BROADER STANDARD THE INTERFERES STANDARD. AN WHAT'S IN THE MAJOR LEAGUE UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACT WHICH SPECIFICALLY GIVES THE RIGHT. THE CLUBS THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE- THE USE OF NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CHAU. THAT'S WHY WE OPPOSE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AS IT IS TODAY. AND I SHOULD POINT OUT AS I DID EARLIER THE CURRENT MINOR LEAGUE YOU UNIFORMED PLAYER CONTRACT DOES NOT DEPRIVE A PLAYER OF HIS AND I ALL RIGHTS IT SIMPLY REQUIRES. THAT THE CLUB REVIEW AND APPROVE THAT SO THAT IT THEIR PROPERLY USED. IN OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE PROPOSING SOMETHING DO HELLO ONE LAST QUESTION YOU'RE PROPOSING SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT WORKS- THIS IS EXACTLY THE NCA SITUATION THIS IS REALLY WELL DOCUMENTED VERY EASY TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S ANY- CERTAINLY- WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT WOULD GIVE THE BY BUT I'VE READ I ASKED A DIFFERENT QUESTION BIG BIG BECAUSE THEY STATED THE WHITE ITS OPERATING AND YOUR BILL CHANGES THE WAY IT'S OPERATING WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE WAY IT'S OPERATING NOW NEEDS TO BE CHECKED. WHAT WE THINK IT'S NEED TO CHECK. THE BILL CHANGES FROM WHAT HE SAID. THE COST REGARDING AND IT. DOESN'T IT STATE'S PLAYERS WILL NOT MAKE PUBLIC APPEARANCES PARTICIPANT RATER TELEVISION OR ONLINE COMPUTER FORMS OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC CONFERENCES OR ANY SUPPORT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT A PERSON FROM PROFITING FROM VIDEO GAMES. AND OTHER ITEMS OUTSIDE THEIR JOB RESPONSIBILITIES. AND YEAH THAT'S WHICH I CHANGE THAT SMELLS ABOUT. SENATOR I WOULD ASK SENATOR BACKER TO FINISH READING THE PARAGRAPH FROM THE UNIFORMED PLAYER CONTRACT. YOU ARE I DON'T HAVE THAT PIECE HERE BUT- ONE IS THIS THE RIGHT AFTER THE NCAA SITUATION. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING- THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE SORT OF WELL DOCUMENTED PIECE. AND WE CAN IF THERE'S ANY CLEAR PRIMACY BE TAKEN WE CAN TAKE UP. BUT THE REALITY IS WE HAVE PLAYERS I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT DOESN'T WORK AND WHY YOU FEEL LIKE IT HAS TO CHANGE IT WAS A VIDEO GAME YOU JUST READ WHAT'S IN THERE BUT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY. YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO. GAME OUT SEVEN DOLLAR VIDEO GAME MIGHT PLAYERS ARE THEIR THEY'RE NOT BENEFIT A PENNY. THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. AND TO COULD CLARIFY TO MEMBERS GOING FORWARD. IN JUDICIARY IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY- THIS OTHER PIECE WE BELIEVE. THAT THAT THAT PART IS VERY CLEAR- AND THAT TO ANY OTHER CONCERNS. ARE UNWARRANTED THE PLAYERS JUST WANT A PIECE OF THAT RECORD. THANK YOU I'M SORRY ONE LONGER THAN NINE INTENDED BUT THIS. I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M NOT SURE THIS IS. TOTALLY CLEAR- TOTALLY TOGETHER I'M TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE THE REASON FOR TEN I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THAT BECAUSE NORMALLY I GIVE ME FINISH NORMALLY I GIVE THE AUTHOR A CHANCE TO WORK IT OUT AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THERE'S- SOMETHING HERE THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT. AND THAT'S WHAT SORT OF UNCLEAR YEAH JUST ANSWER WE WOULD BE DOING THE BILL IF EVERYTHING'S CO PATHETIC THE REALITY IS. THEY ARE UNDERSTAND THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT WE DO BILLS ALL THE TIME JUST LOOK AT THE ENERGY DEREGULATION IT WAS SORT OF CLEAR HERE'S OUR VALUES HERE SO WE HAVE TO DO. THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SO ON INTENDED THAT WE DON'T WITH THEM FOR YEARS AND SO I GET WHAT OUR VALUES ARE OUR VALUES ARE REALLY CLEAR YOU'RE ACTING OUT OF THE VALUES BUT I CAN'T TELL IF WHAT THE BILL DOES. MATCHES THAT AND DOESN'T HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND ISN'T MUCH BROADER THAN IT SHOULD BE SO THAT'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IN THE EARLY YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT IN THE CLUB. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH TO BOTH OF YOU WHAT ARE. CONVERSE CENTER NEWMAN DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I DO AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE INTO FIND. IF ANY THIS IS DUPLICATIVE I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE. I WANT TO COME BACK TO THIS DISCUSSION OF- SEVEN USERS FOR YEARS TO PLAY CONTROL AT THE FOR MR BERGAN SEEMS VERY. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MENTIONED OR TALKED ABOUT SIGNING BONUSES THE AND THEIR IMPACT. ON NOT OLY THE BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY BUT ON HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE. YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN THOSE FOREIGN SEVEN AND HOW IT MIGHT INFLUENCE YOUR- TREATMENT OF TALENT- IF THAT WOULD CHANGE. THE LOOK OF A WITNESS ADDRESS IT AFTERWARDS OKAY BECAUSE HE WAS NOT HERE FOR THAT. YEAH I CAN I CAN TELL YOU IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE AVERAGE SIGNING BONUS WAS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PLAYER BUT THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL PLAYERS IT'S A RANGE- FROM FAIRLY LOW. VERY VERY HIGH FIGURE. SO THAT'S THE ARAB. SIGNING BONUS FOR A PLAYER SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE CONSIDERATION THE PLAYERS ARE. LEARNING JOURNEY TO BE CLEAR I MEAN YOU KNOW ON AVERAGE. A PLAYER INJURED PLAYERS GETTING SOME OUTSIDE OF US. AND THAT'S BEING ADVERTISED ACROSS THE LENGTH OF TEAM CONTROL. RIGHT SO YOU KOW TO SOME EXTENT THEY MAY BE- YOU TAKE A CHANCE ON THEIR JOB THEY HAVE RECEIVED SOME COMPENSATION IN ADVANCE- AND THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SOME OF THE TOWN THAT YOU WISH YOU SEARCHES YOU MAKE CORRECT. YES OBVIOUSLY THE PLAYERS THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS- MORE TALENTED A RECEIVE. HIGHER SIGNING BONUSES THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS. ACROSS THE BOARD IT DEPENDS ON- YOU KNOW ARE THEY COLLEGE PLAYER OR THEY HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER AND THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABLES AT PLAY. SURE IF YOU'RE DURATION YOUR CONTROLS LIMIT OF FOUR YEARS WITH THAT CHANGE. HOW YOU WOULD APPROACH THE BONUSES IF YOU HAD. LESS LESS TIME TO EVALUATE TALENTLESS TIME TO THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT. I THINK CLUBS WOULD BE LOW TO SIGN PLAYERS FOR HIGH SIGNING BONUSES THAT THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT PLAYER WOULD BE READY TO PLAY IN THE MAJORS WITHIN THE FOUR YEAR TIME FRAME. WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT INTERNATIONAL LEE- FOREIGN BORN PLAYERS FOR HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE SIGNED. AND LESS LIKELY TO BE SIGNED FOR. HIGHER SIGNING BONUSES. PRECIADO TO SERVE THANK YOU OR CLARIFYING SO COMING BACK TO THE AND I'LL DISCUSSION OF WITH THE FLEET OKAY. CAN I DON'T KNOW GOOD SIR. NOPE BUT SENATE RECORD BUDGET DID HER WITNESS OF THE BECAUSE THERE WITNESS FOR NOT INVESTMENT JUST SO YOU KNOW. SO THE FULL LENGTH OFTHE PC PLAYERS TO PAY FOR PER WEEK AT THE COMPLEX WE LEVEL. FIVE HUNDRED PER WEEK A SINGLE A LEVEL SIX HUNDRED PER WEEK IT'S AVAILABLE. WE AT DOUBLE A. OF THESE ARE NOT WHO ARE GET. BIG SIGNING BONUSES SO I WOULDN'T EXPECT- THAT THAT THREE THREE OF THE AVERAGE CAN BE MISSED. SO IT TWENTY FIVE POINT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HEAR FROM OUR WITNESS- WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AT THE CLOSING. STRETCH THAT SINCE THEN IMAGES GOD BUT I THINK YOU MADE IT CLEAR I DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR WITNESS BUT IT TOO MUCH WHAT. I DID MY IT DOES IT'S GOING TO BE THE THINKCENTRE LATER COVERED A LOT OF THIS- THE QUESTION AROUND AND- I. L. ISSUES. YOU KNOW. IS THIS TRULY LIKE THE INCIDENT LET FOR MR FERNANDES AND SOAK IT MAY AS I UNDERSTAND IT MAY BE TRUE FOR VIDEO GAMES BUT IT'S REALLY NOT TRUE FOR OTHER. APPLICATIONS ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT MIGHT PRESENT THEMSELVES THE PLAYERS FOR NAME IMAGE LIKENESS DEALS. WELL THE ISSUE WHEN AND I'LL THE NC DOUBLE A ISSUE WAS THAT THE PLAYERS HAVE NO RIGHTS. I AS I pPLAYER CONTRA. POLITICAL PLAYER DOES THEIR- PARTS TO THAT PROVE. THE FIRST PART GRANT THE CLUB. THE RIGHT TO. YOU GOING NEED IN ORDER TO DO EVERYTHING FROM PROMOTED TEAM YOU KNOW. MAKE BOBBLE HEADS- DO BROADCAST EXETER EXETER THAT'S THERE'S A GRANT OF. THERE THERE'S THE SECOND PART. IS THE PART THAT EXPLAINS YOU KNOW THAT BASICALLY- GIVES THE CLUB THE RIGHT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE THE USE. OF THE PLAYERS- AND I ALL RIGHT. BUT THE PROVISION ITSELF PRESERVES THE PLAYERS AND I ALL RIGHTS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PREVENT THE PLAYER FROM EXERCISING INDEPENDENT AND I OWE YOU KNOW INDEPENDENTLY EXERCISING. THE AND I ALLRIGHT AND DOING THE DEAL PROVIDED IT'S APPROVED BY THE COURT. AND SERVICE TO REQUIRE THE NC DOUBLE A DID IN FACT PROHIBIT. THAT ENHANCE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NC DOUBLE A PROHIBITED PLAYERS FROM DOING THAT AND- IT WAS REQUIRED THAT THEY BE. THAT THAT PROHIBITION BE LIFTED IN ESSENCE. AND BY THE WAY THE- THE USE OF AN AYE ALL RIGHTS IT IS ALSO AS I INDICATED. SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL. I ON THE SPECIFIC. MAJORLY UNIFORMS CONTRACT. THE BILL- THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND JUST TO BE FAIR I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH IN NORMALLY WE THERE'S A THERE'S A LITTLE MORE CAUTION ABOUT WHO SPEAKS AT WHAT TIME- AND I WANT TO BE FAIR SENATOR BAKER WOULD YOU LIKE TO IN YOUR WITNESS TO ADDRESS ONE LAST QUESTION I'LL GIVE THEM. ONE MINUTE TO ADDRESS AND THEY WILL HAVE YOU DO YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT YEAH LIKE TO WITNESS TO- I TREVOR JUST ADDRESS IF YOU THOUGHT HE BE pFREE AGENT AFTER FOUR YEARS- AND IF HE HAS ANY OTHER COMMENT ABOUT- THIS BUT ANY OF THE OTHER DISCUSSION FUTURE. OKAY JERRY HAVE ONE MINUTE HI. HI YES- NO I DON'T THINK I'D BE DISADVANTAGED HI MY CONTRACT MY INITIAL CONTACT WITH ONLY FOUR YEARS- EVEN IF YOUR INITIAL CONTACT IS SEVEN YEARS LIKE MONOLITH THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE YOU SEVEN YEARS PLAYING MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL THEY CAN CATCH YOU YOUR FIRST SPRING TRAINING WHICH I'VE SEEN. AND THEY CAN KEEP YOU IN THE MINOR LEAGUES ALL OF TO PULL YOU UP BEFORE CONTRACTORS EITHER SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS RE SIGNING THE CONTRACTS THE BATES. NINTH AND TENTH YEARS. THE SECOND ONE IS UNDERDOG BECAUSE- THEY K. BEACON. AREA PAY THEM A NO I DON'T THINK IT I THINK IT HELP PLAYERS FASHION GET HIRED STARTING A SHIFT USER ORALLY ENCOURAGED TO BE IN A NATION THAN THAT'S IT. AND MAYBE GIVE JUST A SIGNING BONUS. WHAT WAS YOUR SIGN BONUS. AT CAL BERKELEY BUCKS A TWENTY THREE AND THEN FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS AFTER TAX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TREVOR SENATOR RECORD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE- ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- ENGAGEMENT AND THAT WAS FOR THAT CENTER ARCHER HERE- BECAUSE HE'S APPRECIATE HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR- TEAM I THINK THAT THE QUESTION IS- IF WE BELIEVE IN ANY WAY THAT. THAT FORCED TO CONTROL. THE PLAYERS TO BE CONTROLLED FOR SEVEN YEARS IS SOMEHOW IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. I THINK THAT IS A- IS- KIND OF CLEARLY A LAUGHABLE- PROPOSITION- SO I THINK THAT THE QUESTION HERE IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE TEAMS ARE CONCERNED FOR THEIR- COMPETITIVENESS. I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA LEAD AND I THINK THE RIGHT THING WILL FOLLOW. UN IF THAT WERE TO SOMEHOW- NOT HAPPENED THIS PAST AND WE FOUR YEAR CONTRACTS IN THAT AND SUCH. AGAIN PLAYER YOU KNOW TEAMS HERE CAN STILL SIGN SOMEONE FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS OF HER LIFE SO I JUST THINK IT ANY ANY PROPOSITION THAT SOMEHOW. CHANGING THIS I MEAN AGAIN I'M SURE I WAS NOT AROUND FREE AGENCY BUT I'M SURE THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS WERE MADE HOW THIS THE FRIDGE SHE WAS GETTING ATTACHMENT- SOMEHOW- TO THE PLAYERS- AND- YOU KNOW AND- LUCKILY YOU KNOW I THINK PREVAILED AND- I'LL GET THE KERR FLIGHT CASE AND WE HAVE. A FREE AGENCY UN SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY THAT THE KEY POINT HERE IS WE BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING PLAYERS TO CONTROL IN SEVEN YEARS. AT THE SALARIES THAT WE ARE NOW WITH THE SIGNING BONUS THAT WE HEARD IT'S PROBABLY ON AVERAGE- IS IN THE PLAYER'S BEST INTEREST NO. CLEARLY IT'S NOT. QUESTION ARE WE WILLING TO. A STEP FOR. IF THERE'S ISSUES AND I OUT WERE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THEM. THAT WE KNOW THERE'S THIS GAME FOR EXAMPLE THEY DON'T GET PAID FOR- BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA ALLOW THEM TO GO OUTSIDE YOU KNOW THERE WILL STILL BE. I'M SURE I JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO. MAKE SURE AND I THINK THAT I DON'T THINK A BILL CHANGES THAT- WHERE TEAMS CAN CONSENT- TO. TO YOU KNOW IT CAN TO MAKE SURE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE BRAND TEAM. SO I THINK THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE. AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WITNESS APPRECIATE THE- DISCUSSION AND- I TO PUT- ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SO THAT WE CAN- MOVE FORWARD. AND- CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR RECORD DO YOU MOTION SB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. SO WHO COULD NOT MAKE ANOTHER COMMENTERS THAT- FOR THE- ON THE. CERTAINLY OKAY I JUST WANNA I THANK THE AUTHOR- I KNOW WHERE HIS HEART IS IT'S WHERE MY HEART IS AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT WORKING PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR OF THEIR CAREER OF YOU KNOW GET A FAIR SHAKE AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES LEGISLATION SOMETIMES IT TAKES LITIGATION SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS- I- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT UP AND DUMP I'M HOPING THAT SOMEHOW THE COMBINATION OF. DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AMENDMENTS MAYBE IT'S A LITIGATION I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THE COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE. BOTH ADDRESS. EIGHT CHANGE IN- FOR THE PLAYERS THAT FOR THE GOOD OF THE PLAYERS- BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE TO BE WORKED OUT SO- I'M SUPPORTING YOUR BILL BUT- NOT A LOT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE I THINK IN ORDER FOR THIS TO GET ANYWHERE. IF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE OF THE MANAGEMENT COMING IN AND ADDRESSING THESE THESE QUESTIONS THIS IS. NOT AN EASY THING TO DO WITH. THANK YOU I'M GONNA THINK TWICE HERE FOR- FOR PRESIDING AND SHE JUST HANDED THE GAVEL BACK TO ME- AS A RETURN FROM.

I HAVE A- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO- I'VE BEEN VISITING MANY OF THE SCHOOLS LOCALLY- TRAINING CENTERS AND- SPEAKING JUST DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN MY DISTRICT WITH REGARDS TO TRAINING OUR YOUTH AND- FOR JOBS MOVING FORWARD AND SO FORTH. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS PARTICULARLY NEEDED WHEN WE ALREADY CURRENTLY HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE TRAINING AND GIVING OUR STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE REGIONALLY WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WITH REGARDS TO DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. WELL YES- THE BASIC POINT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FOCUS AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO THAT WE CAN- ADEQUATELY- DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS THAT WE DO HAVE FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING WE'RE NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON YOUTH AND SO IF IT IF FUNDS GET OUT THERE INTO YOUTH PROGRAMS IT'S NOT WITH THE ORGANIZED WAY OF GETTING THE FUNDS TO THE YOUTH PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE IS THAT% WE HAVE A STATE LEVEL- YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THAT WILL REALLY- FOCUS AND MAKE SURE THAT FUNDING AND ADEQUATE FUNDING IS GOING INTO OUR YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. SO MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE- HOW DOES THIS FALL INTO YOUR HOW DOES IT PLAY WITH IN. PROGRAMS SUCH AS- THE- R. O. P. TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE AND THE WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING WITHIN OUR- WITHIN OUR DISTRICTS AND- WELL THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE. WHATEVER PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY DOING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WITH YOUTH SANTANDER TO REPLACE THE MARK TO KNOCK THEM OUT IT'S INTENDED TO BUILD UPON THEM AND EXPAND AND GROW- THE NUMBER OF- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR YOUTH. OKAY I THINK. THE FEELS PRESSURE. OKAY ANYBODY ALSO WISH TO COMMERCENTRE NEWMAN YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SHOW- SENATOR RUSSELL.

I AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS CALIFORNIA WAS INCOME INEQUALITY- BUT I'D ARGUE THAT WE ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITY AND QUALITY AND WE ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB- CONNECTING YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE CREATING PATHWAYS TO THE KINDS OF WORK YOU'VE DESCRIBED RIGHT TO DUE TO CAREER OR EMPLOYMENT IN THE TRADES PAGE WELL CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED- EVEN AS WE PLACE KIND OF SOMEWHAT ORGAN UNDUE EMPHASIS ON COLLEGE DEGREES AND WHITE COLLAR WORK. ALL RIGHT THIS IS A GOOD AND VERY LEVERAGE USED TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ESPECIALLY THE EARLIER THE BETTER THE SOONER WE EDUCATE YOUNG PEOPLE- GIVE THEM A SENSE OF WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF WHAT THEY MIGHT PURSUE. THE BETTER THE BETTER THE RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT SO MANY ON THE BILL WOULD BE HONORED TO BE. A DAD IS A CO. AUTHOR HAPPY TO MOVE IT TO PROTECT. OKAY ELSE IF NOT. WE HAVE THE OFFER OF A MOTION FROM SO NEW CENTER. SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL.

IN THE BY CHAU CHOI BOGAN MASSEY PER SIDE ONE MORE. TIME SO I CAN PRESENT MY BILL. WHAT CONSIDER CORTESE RICHARD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH SB EIGHT ONE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB THIRTY ONE TWO TODAY LAST FALL ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWO ONE OF TALENTED CINEMATOGRAPHER AUSTRALOID FROM THE SET OF THE MOVIE RUSS. WHEN REVOLVER LOADED WITH A LIVE ROUND WENT OFF KILLING HER AND INJURING ANOTHER. A MOTHER WAS TAKEN IN A FAMILY FOREVER CHANGED SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE BEGAN AS A RESPONSE TO THE TRAGEDY ON THE RUSSET. BUT IS OF ALL THROUGH NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH UNIONS AND GUILDS REPRESENTING WORKERS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. IN THE GROUND BREAKING LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES A BROADER ISSUE OF OVERALL HEALTH AND SAFETY. ON SETS. MAGIC OF FILM AND TELEVISION CAN OBSCURE THE DANGERS OF WORKING IN MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTIONS SHOOTING IS OFTEN OUTSIDE SUBJECT TO ALL KINDS OF WEATHER ENTERING CONDITIONS FOR WORKERS CAN BE INVOLVED IN ANYTHING FROM STUNTS. COMPLEX ELECTRICAL SET UP CAR CRASHES AND EVEN EXPLOSIONS ALL WHILE WORKING LONG IRREGULAR HOURS. OTHER INDUSTRIES ALSO SIGNIFICANT DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. IF YOU HAVE AS MANY AND IS VERY THREATS AND ALL IN ONE PLACE WHERE THE USE OF A FIREARM. IS JUST PART OF ANOTHER DAY AT WORK. WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE TRAGIC INCIDENTS A CO WORKERS. BUT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE ACCIDENTS THAT CAUSED SERIOUS INJURIES AND THE CONSTANT NEAR MISSES. THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY- THE INDUSTRYWIDE LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY COMMITTEE DEVELOP SAFETY BOLTON'S FOR A BROAD ARRAY OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS INCLUDING THE USE OF FIREARMS ON SET FOR THAT THE SHOULD BE COMMENDED AND A KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BOLTONS ARE NOT BY ANY LAWS OR REGULATIONS THE RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES MANY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTIONS FOLLOW THEM BUT MANY OTHERS A LIP SERVICE OR AREN'T. BOUND BY THEM AT ALL. THE ALTERNATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY ON SET WAS WITH THE EMPLOYER. ACCIDENTS ARE PREVENTABLE IF SAFETY MEASURES ARE PRIORITIZE FOLLOWED AND ENFORCED. ENFORCEMENT AND LACK THERE OF IS WITH SB THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES BY TAKING A PROACTIVE RATHER THAN REACTIVE APPROACH. SB THIRTY ONE ESTABLISHES CLEAR ENFORCEABLE SAFETY STANDARDS PROTECT WORKERS ON FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS HE RESPECTS THE USE OF LIVE AMMUNITION ON SET. THAT MANDATE SUFFICIENT STAFFING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WITH FIREARMS ARE ON SET IN REQUIRES THE ONLY CRUISE WITH SPECIFIC TRAINING EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS MANAGE FARMS DURING PRODUCTIONS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BILL RECOGNIZES ENSURING THE OVERALL HEALTH AND SAFETY ON SETS REQUIRES ON THE GROUND OVERSIGHT THIS BILL REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO HAVE A TRAINED QUALIFIED SAFETY SUPERVISOR ON ALL PRODUCTIONS. THE CITY SUPERVISOR WILL WILL BE TASKED WITH CONDUCTING A PRE PRODUCTION RISK ASSESSMENT. IT WILL BE ON SITE EVERY DAY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CAST CREW AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION. THE CONCEPT OF A CITYSUPERVISOR IS NOT NEW IN THE END ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. PRODUCTIONS IN THE UK AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND ALL HAVE SAFETY OFFICER POSITIONS AND CONSULTING POSITIONS IN BOTH THE US PRODUCERS IN UNION MEMBERS WORKING IN THOSE COUNTRIES ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM CAME TOGETHER HERE IN CALIFORNIA SUCCESSFULLY CREATED A COVERT NINETEEN PLAN. THAT INCLUDED COMPLIANCE SUPERVISORS. ON EACH AND EVERY SET. FOCUSED SOLELY A CODE RELATED HEALTH AND SAFETY TO ENSURE THE SAFE RETURN TO WORK DURING THE PANDEMIC. SETS WERE NEVER THE SOURCE OF WIDESPREAD. A COVERT INFECTIONS SO WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO PRIORITIZE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY. TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE. SO LONG AS THERE IS A WILL TO DO IT. BY CODIFYING PROVEN SAFETY MEASURES CREATED IN APPROVED BY THE INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. IN REQUIRING A- EXCUSE ME IT REQUIRED A CRITICAL NEW SAFETY POSITION SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE SETS UP THE FIRST IN THE NATION REGULATORY STRUCTURE TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE AND HOLD EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE IT'S UP TO CALIFORNIA THE HOME OF THE FILM INDUSTRY. THE FILM INDUSTRY TO SET STRONG STANDARDS PROTECTIONS SO THAT TRAGIC ACCIDENTS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW MEXICO. NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN AS WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE THE BILL MOVES US ONE STEP CLOSER TOWARD THE SCHOOL. LASTLY MEMBERS I WILL BE TAKING A MEMBERS TODAY WHICH NUMBER ONE FURTHER CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE SET SAFETY SUPERVISOR. TO SPECIFY THAT THE ARMOR IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN HANDLE A FIREARM. OR HAND A FIREARM TO THE PERFORMER OR CAST OR CREW. IN THREE REQUIRE THAT A SAFETY MEETING TAKE PLACE WHEN FARMS WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE SCENE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY ONE TODAY OR JOHN LINDLEY THE CALIFORNIA I AT C. COUNCIL THE POOREST PARTLY FROM THE DIRECTORS GUILD. OF AMERICA WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER CORTESE- AND WE DO HAVE. LEAD SUPPORT MISTER JOHN LINDLEY. ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM PLEASE PROCEED SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN LESLIE AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS GUILD IATSE LOCAL SIX HUNDRED WE REPRESENT TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. I MYSELF HAVE BEEN WORKING AS A CINEMATOGRAPHER ALMOST FORTY YEARS AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'VE LOST THREE COLLEAGUES TO AVOIDABLE ACCIDENTS I'VE HAD MEMBERS DIED BECAUSE THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT VALUE PLACED ON KEEPING THEM SAFE. I LOST ONE MEMBERS ARE JONES TO A TRAIN TRACK ACCIDENTS ANOTHER BRANCH RICHMOND TO A CAR ACCIDENT DUE TO FATIGUE DRIVING AND THE THIRD HALINA HUTCHINS THE GUNFIRE. AND EACH TIME I OFFER CONDOLENCES TO GRIEVING FAMILIES I PROMISE TO NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. AND IT'S TIME TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE. AND WHILE THESE TRAGIC DEATHS DREW ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE DANGERS AND OUR INDUSTRY WE STILL SUFFER WITH ACCIDENTS AND NEAR MISSES. WITH EXPLOSIONS CAR CRASHES AND FATIGUE RELATED ACCIDENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH GREATER ATTENTION TO SAFETY. IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP BEING REACTIVE AND TO BE PROACTIVE IN MAKING SAFETY A PRIORITY AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR S. B. EIGHT THIRTY ONE. ENTERTAINMENT CENTER STAFFED BY PROFESSIONALS WHO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SAFETY BUT EACH OF US THE FOCUS NARROWLY ON OUR OWN CRAFT. BEER ON THE CAMERA I'M WAITING ON SPEEDING VEHICLES DEAL WITH FIREARMS STORAGE AND MORE. WHAT IS MISSING IS THE PERSON ON SET WHO IS FOCUSED ENTIRELY ON SAFETY WHO LOOKS ACROSS ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE CRAPS. TO ENSURE THAT ALL WORKERS ARE SAFE. SB EIGHT THIRTY ONE WOULD MANDATE A SAFETY SUPERVISOR TO SERVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE. THIS PERSON WOULD BE ON THE GROUND ALONGSIDE US INSURING SAFETY PROTOCOLS ARE FOLLOWED IN AN EVER CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE QUICK DECISIONS ARE DRIVEN BY TIGHT BUDGETS AND SCHEDULES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING EACH WORKER HOME SAFELY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS MEETING PRODUCTION GOALS. AND WHILE THIS IS A GROUNDBREAKING BILL HERE IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT I HAVE WORKED WITH SAFETY SUPERVISORS AT AUSTRALIA AND THEY'RE ALSO USED IN NEW ZEALAND IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. ALL OF OUR MAJOR EMPLOYERS ALSO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY. THEY KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS AND THEY NOTED IT WORKS IN ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES. THAT TIME FOR THE INDUSTRY TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATED A PANDEMIC TO STAND WITH THOSE OF US WHO WORK SO HARD TO CREATE THE MAGICAL MOVIES AND TELEVISION. THE TIME FOR THEM TO JOIN US IN RAISING SAFETY STANDARDS AND ENSURING THERE ARE NO MORE TRAGIC ACCIDENTS WERE PREVENTABLE DEATHS. TOGETHER WE CAN EMBRACE THE NEW RESPECT FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF. SAFETY AND A NEW PARTNERSHIP TO MAKE THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS THAT EXIST ON PAPER INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL AND REAL. SIMPLY PUT. WE CAN SAVE LIVES. WE THANK SENATOR CORTESE PROPER OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND WE ASK. FOR YOUR RIVALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LINLEY- WE NOW HAVE A SET SUPPORT WITNESS.

RESTAUR THE AND FIRE BUT IN WORKERS OUR MEMBERS TO CHURCH. OF STRENGTH LONG AND DANGEROUS INCIDENTS INVOLVING CARS HELICOPTERS ELECTRICITY AND SO ON. THE BRITISH MUSEUM IT'S CRITICAL THAT THIS LEGISLATION DEAL WITH FIREARMS BUT ALSO ADDRESS LARGER STRUCTURAL ISSUES.

RECTORS RELY ON AND WELCOME TRAIN SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TO GIVE US LIMITATIONS ON HOW TO FIND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO KEEP OUR CRUSADE.

THE PERIOD OF TIME WHERE PEOPLE COULD FIX THINGS OR THEY AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN THE- THE PENALTIES ASSESSED HERE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TURNED OVER IN THE BILL- THE WORK TO PROMULGATE THE ACTUAL REGULATIONS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD TRIGGER CODE ENFORCEMENT VIOLATIONS- TO CAL OSHA. BUT I'M HAPPY AS WE GO FORWARD TO- TO GET MORE CLARITY ON THAT TO REPORT BACK TO YOUR OFFICE DIRECTLY BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE ANYONE ELSE IN THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- WHAT THE COMPLIANCE PROCESS WOULD WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH- AN OSHA OFFICER SHOWS UP ON THE SET. WHO TYPICALLY WITH CODE ENFORCEMENT VIOLATIONS OF THAT NATURE OF ANY NATURE IN THE IN THE WORKFORCE- THERE'S A COMPLIANCE ORDER THIS IS CORRECT. OR ELSE YOU'LL BE FINE WE'LL GET CLARITY ON THAT REPORT BACK TO YOU. IT'S A VERY MUCH I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE SCARE OFF THE- MOVIE INDUSTRY. OUTSIDE OF THE STATE SO WHEN WE HAVE FINES THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW HOW PROBLEMATIC THEY WOULD BE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW- BUT I JUST I ALWAYS LIKE TO. GIVE EVERYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO- ADDRESS AN ISSUE OR A CONCERN PRIOR TO BEING YOU KNOW FINAL. PENALIZE BASICALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL- OPPORTUNITIES BUT I THINK SAFETY IS OF THE UTMOST CONCERN AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE- IN YOUR OPINION THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THAT WE SUPPORTED. THAT I SUPPORTED AN ANSWER I THINK WE ALL DID- WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO'S BILL- HOW WOULD YOU WITH HIS BILL. I THINK THE MAIN OF WAR ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES AND I HAVEN'T- I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE COMMITTEE TO NOTE TO FORMALLY REVIEW THAT BILL BUT- THE SURNAME QUITE AWARE OF IT. IN CENTER PORTUNE I'VE TALKED MANY TIMES- GOING BACK TO LAST FALL- IS STARTING THE- STARTING SOON AFTER THE REST TRAGEDY- TO MY KNOWLEDGE. HAVEN'T NOT SEEN THAT THE PRINT COPIES BILL YOU KNOW IN THE LAST FEW DAYS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAFETY SUPERVISOR. OF RIGHT IN IT FOR OVER ALL CTC YOU HEARD SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY TALKING ABOUT YES WE- WE WANT TO CODIFY WE MEAN THE WITNESSES WE WANT TO CODIFY THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE IN THE BALTICS BOLTON ONE INTO- WERE BASICALLY THE UNIONIZED INDUSTRY AND- THE PORTION OF THE- MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION THAT'S THAT'S- TIED TO THOSE BOLTON'S. ABIDES BY CERTAIN SAFETY STANDARDS ON A ON A CONTRACTUAL BASIS ONE WE ARE SAYING THOUGH SHOULD BE CODIFIED. I'M NOT SURE OF HIS HIS BILL DOES THAT OR NOT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ON THE FARM SIDE BUT YOU HEARD WITNESSES TODAY YOU SAY THERE ARE. LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHER SAFETY. ISSUES ON SETS THAT- WE BELIEVE REQUIRE. OF AN OVERALL INDEPENDENT CD SUPERVISOR TO HELP PUT TOGETHER THE SAFETY PLAN IN ADVANCE OF. THE PRODUCTION ON THE SET IT AND THEN HOLDS FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE NOT OCEAN AT THIS POINT BUT SAFETY SUPERVISOR. OF FUNCTIONING AS- OF THE- NO OF ALLIGATOR OF THOSE SAFE PRACTICES ON THE SET IN MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER PLAN THEY PUT PLACES ACTUALLY BEING INVITED BY. THAT THAT IS IN THIS BILL AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN THE BILL. PERFECT THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE- TO THE SENATOR TORONTO YES THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS WELL IN ALL THE SUPPORTERS THIS IS A LIFE AND DEATH ANNA AT TO HEAR OF ANY ONE TWO OR THREE NO MATTER WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED. WE'VE GOTTEN KILLED ON IN THIS LINE OF WORK I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT AND HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND IN REAL TIME THEIR ADDRESS SEEMS OF SAFETY ISSUES I THINK IS GREAT AND I COULD SEE NO OPPOSITION TO THIS SO I ASSUME. THAT THERE IS THERE IS AGREEMENT AND I KNOW AND IMPRENTA CEASE BUT THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND ALL ARE WILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THIS SO I COMMEND YOU AND ALL THE- ALL THE SUPPORTERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.
