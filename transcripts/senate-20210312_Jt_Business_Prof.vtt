00:07:23.643 --> 00:07:24.343
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOCUS ON

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.812

HUNDRED THOUSAND NURSES IN THE

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.791
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.259
INCLUDES INVESTIGATING

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.461
COMPLAINTS. AND THESE

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:43.930
COMPLAINTS AGAINST LICENSED

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.364

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.624
AGAINST THEIR LICENSE NURSES

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:12.892
FOR EXAMPLE WE FOUND THAT THE

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.428
BOARD CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO

00:08:15.494 --> 00:08:17.029
MEET THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.831

EIGHTEEN MONTHS. I TO GIVE YOU

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.437
A FLAVOR FOR THAT WE REVIEWED

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.572
FORTY COMPLAINTS AND WE FOUND

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.174
THAT FOR THIRTY ONE OF THOSE

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:29.575
COMPLAINTS IT TOOK THE BOARD

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:31.410
LONGER THAN A HUNDRED OR EIGHT

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.246
I'M SORRY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO

RESOLVE THE COMPLAINTS. IN FACT

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:37.950
FIFTEEN OF THOSE COMPLAINTS

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.619
ACTUALLY TOOK LONGER THAN THREE

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.554
YEARS FOR THE BOARD TO RESOLVE

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.956
SO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. AND

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.225
THOSE DELAYS PRIMARILY OCCURRED

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.494
WE FOUND BECAUSE OF B. R. AND

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.897
INEFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OVER ITS

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.832
OWN COMPLAINT RESOLUTION

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.935
PROCESS AND ITS FAILURE TO MOVE

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.203
THESE COMPLAINTS THROUGH THE

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.740
VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROCESS

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.274
IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.808
MANNER. AND ULTIMATELY THESE

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.411
DAYS THESE DELAYS CONTRIBUTED

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:07.613
TO A BACKLOG OF CASES AWAITING

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.315

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.926
HUNDRED EIGHTY CASES. THEY HAD

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.861
NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED TO AN

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.163

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.304
BE URGENT ARE HIGH PRIORITY AND

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.939
THEY WERE OUTSTANDING AND

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:33.940
HADN'T BEEN ASSIGNED TO AN

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:36.542
INVESTIGATOR FOR AN AVERAGE OF

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.945
MORE THAN EIGHTY DAYS. WE MADE

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.813

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.359
ALMOST ALL OF THOSE

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.328
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THE

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:56.896

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.467
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.970
ABOUT NEXT. SO WE RECOMMENDED

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:05.338

SENT US A REPORTED OUR REQUEST

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.395
IN SUPPORT OF THAT. LAST FOUR

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.498
TWO YEARS LATER IN JANUARY

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.332
TWENTY TWENTY WE RECEIVED A

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.301
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT. THAT

WAS FALSIFIED. IN OTHER WORDS

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.341

ITS BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS WHEN

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.053

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.954
CONDUCTING A FORMAL

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.922

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:02.728
SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT TWO

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.597
EXECUTIVES HAD DEVISED THE

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.966
PLAN. COULD MANIPULATE B. R.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.835
ENDS DATA SAID TO BASICALLY

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:11.670

BOARD DID THIS. IS THEY WENT

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:19.979
INTO THEIR- CASELOAD SYSTEM AND

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:22.148
THEY REASSIGNED CASES TWO

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.849
DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS SO THAT

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.618
NO ONE INVESTIGATOR HOW TO

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.653
CASELOAD OF MORE THAN TWENTY

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.522
CASES. AND THEY DID THAT IN

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.590
PART BY SIGNING INVESTIGATIONS

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.858
TO INVESTIGATORS THAT WERE ON

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.794

TYPICALLY DIDN'T REALLY WORK ON

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.669
CASES AT ALL. SO IN RELIANCE ON

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:46.572
THAT REPORTS WE CONCLUDED THAT

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:47.740

THESE BEER AND MANAGERS WENT

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.685

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:45.818
ONE NOW. WE TOOK ADDITIONAL

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:48.287
MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.289
RELY ON ANY INFORMATION THAT

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.524
THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:54.460
PROVIDED US. SO NOW I WANT TO

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:55.561
TALK ABOUT MOVE ON TO THAT

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:57.229
SECOND AUDIT REPORT OUR MOST

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:00.199
RECENT REPORTS. THAT WAS ISSUED

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:03.002
IN JULY OF LAST YEAR. AND THAT

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.837
AUDIT WAS FOCUSED ON THE BOARD

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.740
OF REGISTERED NURSING- THEIR

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:09.842
OVERSIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S PRE

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:13.612
LICENSURE NURSING PROGRAMS. AND

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.614
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUT THAT

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.882
WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE ON

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:20.319
PAGE ONE. IT SUMMARIZES THE

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.387
THREE KEY FINDINGS OF THAT

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.322
REPORT THAT I'M GONNA TALK

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:26.191
ABOUT THIS MORNING- AND TWO OF

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.894
THE KEY FINDINGS REALLY RELATE

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.730
TO THE BOARDS- INVOLVEMENT IN

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:33.899
DECISIONS THAT IN FACT THAT A

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:36.669
FACT. THE ENROLLMENT OF

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:38.804
CALIFORNIA'S NURSING PROGRAMS

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.706
AND THE THIRD ISSUE RELATES TO

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.976
THE BOARD'S EFFORTS TO OVERSEE

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:46.845
THESE NURSING PROGRAMS. SO FOR

00:15:46.912 --> 00:15:48.847
THE FIRST ISSUE. WHAT WE FOUND

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.984
IS THAT- B. RN'S GOVERNING

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:53.686
BOARD DATE LIKE I SAID THEY

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:56.689
APPROVE NEW PROGRAMS AND THEY

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.023
ALSO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THE

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.591
NUMBER OF ENROLLMENTS TO

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:02.461
APPROVE FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS.

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:03.762
IN THESE DECISIONS ARE VERY

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:05.197
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY AFFECT

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:06.832
THE FLOW STUDENTS INTO THE

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:09.301
NURSING PROGRAMS AND ULTIMATELY

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:12.504
THEY AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF STAYS

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.006
UP I'M SORRY OF NURSES IN THE

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.175
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT ONE OF

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:17.776
THE KEY FACTORS THAT THE BOARD

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:19.712
HAS TO CONSIDER THAT INFLUENCES

00:16:19.778 --> 00:16:22.915
THESE DECISIONS IS THE SUPPLY

00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:25.017
OF NURSES. NOW BUREN DOES

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:27.019
CONTRACT WITH THE UC SAN

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:31.357
FRANCISCO AND TO PROVIDE A- TO

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:33.092
BASICALLY PROVIDE EVERY TWO

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.928
YEARS AS STATEWIDE NURSING-

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:38.263
WORK FORCE FORECAST AND WE

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.498
LOOKED AT THEIR MOST RECENT

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.633
FORECAST IN TWO THOUSAND

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.435
SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.303
NINETEEN AND BASICALLY THE

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.205
FORECAST IS SAYING THAT THE

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.307
SUPPLY AND DEMAND. OF NURSES IN

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.708
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.043
GOING TO BE FAIRLY WELL

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.678
BALANCED OVER THE NEXT TEN

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.013
YEARS- ON IT BASED ON A

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.349
STATEWIDE FOCUS HOWEVER THE

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.785
REPORT DOES NOT LOOK AT

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.020
REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.355
SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF NURSES

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:06.492
THEREFORE IT OBSCURES ANY HE

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:09.828
REGIONAL SHORTAGES AND FAX WE

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.363
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.565
STUDIES. THAT DID HAVE A

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.667
REGIONAL FOCUS AND THOSE

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:17.503
STUDIES ARE PROJECTING THAT

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.139
THERE ARE REGIONALSHORTAGES OF

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:22.141
NURSES IN CALIFORNIA NOW AND

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.208
THEY'RE PROJECTING THAT THE

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:24.543
SHORTAGES WILL CONTINUE INTO

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.212
THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE THESE

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.647
FORECASTS INDICATE THAT THERE

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:29.748
ARE SEVERAL REGIONS IN

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.050
CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE BAY

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.219
AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:36.522
CENTRAL COAST. THAT ARE

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:38.690
PROJECTED TO HAVE NURSING

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:42.327
SHORTAGES IN THE FUTURE. SO

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:44.129
BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS OUR

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.898
RECOMMENDATION TO B. R. M. WAS

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.699
THAT IT NEEDS TO INCORPORATE

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:50.636
REGIONAL FORECASTS INTO THESE

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:53.138
BIENNIAL ANALYSES- TO BETTER

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.807
ENABLE ITS GOVERNING BOARD TO

00:17:54.873 --> 00:17:57.142
MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS.

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.044
THAT WOULD ADDRESS ANY REGIONAL

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:04.750
SHORTAGES OF NURSES. AND SKIN

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.785
SO WHEN THE ITEM WENT OUT IN

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.520
JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY BEER AND

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:10.322
PROVIDED AN INITIAL RESPONSE

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:12.324
AND INITIALLY WHAT THEY SAID

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:15.661
WAS THAT THIS CURRENT CONTRACT.

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:19.331
FOR THE WORK FORCE FORECAST-

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:20.566
WITH EXPIRING IN JUNE OF THIS

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.100
YEAR AND THEY SAID THAT THE

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.102
WORK UNDER THAT CONTRACT HAD

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:26.071
ALREADY BEEN DONE. BUT THEY

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.573
ASSURED US THAT THEY WOULD ASK

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:29.708
THEIR CONTRACTOR TO INCLUDE A

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.543
REGIONAL ANALYSIS IN THE

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.246
REPORT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.381
DELIVERED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.783
HOWEVER FAST FORWARD TO THEIR

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.284
MOST RECENT RESPONSE THAT WE

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:40.352
RECEIVED IN JANUARY OF THIS

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.255
YEAR. IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:45.023
AMBIGUOUS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.926
THE NEXT- FORECAST IS GOING TO

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:49.428
INCLUDE THIS REGIONAL ANALYSIS

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:52.164
BECAUSE WHAT B. R. AND SAID IS

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.967
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REVISE

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.202
THEIR NEXT CONTRACT. THAT WOULD

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.205
COVER THE PERIOD JULY TWENTY

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.241
TWENTY ONE THREE JUNE OF TWENTY

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:02.774
TWENTY THREE TO INCLUDE A

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:06.144
SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE RELATED TO

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.681
A REGIONAL ANALYSES- YEAH AND

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.116
THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:12.484
ANTICIPATE TO START THAT

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:14.620
CONTRACT PROCUREMENT PROCESS IN

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:16.622
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. THE

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.257
PROBLEM IS THE LANGUAGE OF THAT

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.859
RESPONSE REALLY DOESN'T CLARIFY

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:23.629
WHETHER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.631
FORECAST THAT'S DUE SOMETIME

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.065
THIS YEAR WILL INCLUDE A

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:29.701
REGIONAL ANALYSIS OR NIGHTS.

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.003
AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF IT

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.204
DOESN'T INCLUDE A REGIONAL

00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:35.841
ANALYSIS. AND THE BOARD MAY NOT

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:36.475
HAVE THAT INFORMATION UNTIL THE

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.911
NEXT. ANALYSIS IS DUE AND

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:41.179
THAT'S NOT TILL TWENTY TWENTY

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.549
THREE SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:44.283
WE MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION TO

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:48.587
THE BOARD. LAST SUMMER OF

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:49.121
TWENTY TWENTY AND NOW SIX

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:51.290
MONTHS LATER IT'S- IT DOESN'T

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.425
APPEAR THAT THE BOARD HAS

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.460
REVISED THAT CONTRACT TO

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:57.462
REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TO

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.164
PROVIDE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:01.867
THE REGIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.169
OF NURSES. AND I WOULD PREFER

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:06.438
TO BE OUR AND TO PROVIDE SOME

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.173
CLARIFICATION TO THE COMMITTEE

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.509
REGARDING WHERE THEY'RE OUT

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.511
WITH THAT AND WHETHER THE

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:13.645
TWENTY TWENTY ONE REGION- I'M

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.981
SORRY. WORKFORCE FORECAST WILL

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:18.016
INCLUDE A REGIONAL ANALYSIS OR

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:22.187
NOT. HIS SECOND KEY ISSUE IN

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.256
THAT REPORT IS THAT WE FOUND

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.158
THAT THE GOVERNING BOARD WHEN

00:20:26.224 --> 00:20:28.026
THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS TO

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:30.729
APPROVE NEW NURSING PROGRAMS.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.332
OR TO INCREASE THE ENROLLMENT

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.200
OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THEY'RE

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.569
NOT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.004
THE AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.073
PLACEMENT SLOTS WHEN THEY MAKE

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:44.843
THOSE DECISIONS. AND THIS IS A

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.211
THIS IS A KEY FACTOR THAT

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.780
REALLY SHOULD BE INFLUENCING

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:50.482
THE GOVERNING BOARD'S DECISIONS

00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:52.084
BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE NUMBER

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.419
OF STUDENTS ENROLLED AND THEN

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.622
OBVIOUSLY LATER AFFECTS THE

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.824
SUPPLY OF NURSES IN THE STATE

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.226
OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE THING IS

00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.028
ABOUT THESE PLACEMENTS LOSSES

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.430
THAT THESE ARE REQUIRED- AND

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:08.800
NURSING PROGRAMS HAS TO SECURE

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:09.835
THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:11.837
FLIGHTS SO THAT THEIR STUDENTS

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:13.538
CAN GET THE REQUIRED CLINICAL

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.441
PLACEMENT EXPERIENCE. IN ORDER

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.443
TO QUALIFY TO TAKE THE STATE

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.846
LICENSURE EXAM BUT THESE ARE

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.948
LIMITED RESOURCES BECAUSE NOT

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:24.783
ALL CLINICAL FACILITIES HAVE

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.753
THE CAPACITY FOR THE DESIRE TO

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:30.188
OFFER PLACEMENT SLOTS TO

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.823
NURSING PROGRAM STUDENTS.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.959
CONSEQUENTLY THE NUMBER OF

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:35.727
CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS CAN

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:38.230
REALLY CONSTRAIN THE

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:42.734
AVAILABILITY OF- PROGRAMS TO-

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.270
INCREASE THEIR ENROLLMENT TO

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:46.104
STUDENTS. THE OTHER THING THAT

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:47.706
WE FOUND AS WE HEARD THAT THERE

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:50.976
ARE- MANY NURSING PROGRAMS ARE

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:52.744
REPORTING TO US THAT THERE ARE

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.880
MANY STUDENTS THAT WERE

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.282
ACTUALLY DISPLACED. FROM THEIR

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:59.384
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BECAUSE

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:01.553
OTHER STUDENTS TOOK THOSE SPOTS

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.155
SO THERE APPEARS TO BE A

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.090
SHORTAGE OF THESE CLINICAL

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.693
FACILITIES THAT STUDENTS REALLY

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.361
NEED TO GET THAT REQUIRED

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:12.297
CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. TOM IS.

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.032
THAT B. R. AND DOES NOT

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:15.634
ADEQUATELY TRACKED THE NUMBER

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.070
OF AVAILABLE SLOTS IN THESE

00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.472
CLINICAL FACILITIES AND THE

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:22.474
DEMAND FOR THESE CLINICAL

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:24.109
FACILITIES FROM THE NURSING

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:26.678
PROGRAMS. AND SO BECAUSE IT'S

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:28.714
NOT GATHERING THAT INFORMATION

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.648
WHEN THE BOARD MAKES ITS

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:32.017
DECISIONS IT DOESN'T HAVE CLEAR

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:34.786
INFORMATION ON THE SUPPLY OF

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.788
CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS. IN

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.657
THE DEMAND SO IT'S NOT ABLE TO

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:40.759
MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:43.095
WHETHER OR NOT IF IT IF IT

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:45.097
APPROVES INCREASE ENROLLMENT

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:47.165
AND AN EXISTING PROGRAM COULD

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:48.734
THAT RESULTS IN THE

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.436
DISPLACEMENT OF STUDENTS FROM

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:52.771
ANOTHER PROGRAM. SO WE

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.206
RECOMMENDED THAT BEYOND THE

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.240
NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.942
GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:58.577
AVAILABILITY OF THESE CLINICAL

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:00.712
PLACEMENT SLOTS IN THE STATE OF

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:03.048
CALIFORNIA AND THE DEMAND FOR

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:04.316
THOSE SLOTS FROM NURSING

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.918
PROGRAMS. AND ONCE THEY GET

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:07.986
THAT WE NEED TO START PROVIDING

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.254
IT TO THE BOARD SO THAT THE

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:11.223
BOARD HAS THAT INFORMATION WHEN

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.658
IT'S MAKING THESE IMPORTANT

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.694
ROLE MY DECISIONS. THE B. R.

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.629
AND- THEY AGREE WITH THAT

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.197
ENDING AND IT MAKES SENSE TO

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:21.032
THEM CONCEPTUALLY AND THERE

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.901
JANUARY STATUS UPDATE REPORT

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.636
THEY THEY DID REPORT THAT THEY

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:27.205
HAVE REVISED. THE FORMS THAT

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.875
THEY USE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE

00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:31.443
NUMBER OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.677
FACILITIES THAT NURSING

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:35.180
PROGRAMS ARE USING. HOWEVER

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:36.515
THEY REPORTED THAT THEY WERE

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:37.883
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:23:37.949 --> 00:23:41.253
DEVELOPING- REGULATIONS. THAT

00:23:41.319 --> 00:23:42.687
THEY SAY ARE NECESSARY TO

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.589
REQUIRE NURSING PROGRAMS AND

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.858
FACILITIES TO PROVIDE THIS

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.326
INFORMATION. AND THEY'RE ALSO

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:49.628
STILL IN THE PROCESS OF

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.496
DEVELOPING A DATABASE BECAUSE

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:54.733
WE UGGESTED THAT THEY NEED TO

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.501
START CAPTURING INFORMATION ON

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:57.903
THE AVAILABILITY THIS CLINICAL

00:23:57.969 --> 00:24:00.906
CAPACITY THE DEMAND FOR IT. PUT

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:02.941
IT IN A DATABASE SO THEY CAN

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.276
SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.777
THEIR BOARD AND MAKE IT

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:08.146
AVAILABLE PUBLICLY TO NURSING

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:10.816
PROGRAMS- BUT THAT HAS NOT

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:12.384
HASN'T HAPPENED YET AND IT'S

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.286
NOT CLEAR TO US WHETHER THAT'S

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:16.388
GONNA HAPPEN. BY APRIL BY THE

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:18.056
APRIL FIRST DEADLINE THAT WE

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.291
INCLUDE IN OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:22.727
SO AGAIN. I WOULD DEFER TO BE

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.329
OUR ENDS EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:25.330
TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.032
CURRENT STATUS OF ITS EFFORTS

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:29.501
IN THAT CRITICAL AREA. ONE OF

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.503
THE THING RELATED TO THAT.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.305
BECAUSE THIS ISSUE OF THESE

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:35.140
THIS CLINICAL EXPERIENCES SUCH

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:36.875
A KEY ISSUE FOR STUDENTS TO

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:38.777
MAKE SURE THAT THEY- THEY THEY

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.478
ARE ABLE TO GET THIS EXPERIENCE

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:41.580
AND MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.481
GRADUATE FROM THESE PROGRAMS

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:45.517
AND TAKE A LICENSURE EXAM. ONE

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.886
OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IS WE

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:50.055
GOT A HOLD OF OSHKOSH IS THE

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:51.756
OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.825
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THEY

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:56.061
HAVE A DOWNLOADABLE DATABASE

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.796
THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF ALL

00:24:57.863 --> 00:24:58.997
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN THE

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:02.234
ENTIRE STATE SO WE DID. IS WE

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.135
GATHER INFORMATION FROM B. R.

00:25:04.202 --> 00:25:06.404
N. FIRST SIXTEEN NURSING

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:09.241
PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA AND

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:11.343
FIVE AREA COUNTIES AND WHAT WE

00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:13.311
DID IS FOR THOSE SIXTEEN

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:15.247
PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA. WE

00:25:15.313 --> 00:25:20.018
COMPARED THE FACILITIES. THAT

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:20.552
THE PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:21.519
USING. THE POPULAR OF ALL

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.255
AVAILABLE FACILITIES IN THE BAY

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:25.924
AREA USING ARAFAT'S DATA. AND

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:28.460
WE FOUND THAT. FOR THOSE JUST

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:30.762
THOSE SIXTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS

00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:32.464
THEY'RE ONLY USING A HUNDRED

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.533
AND TWENTY ONE OF MORE THAN

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.968
SEVEN HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.536
ARE OUT THERE JUST IN THE BAY

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:40.472
AREA SUCH LESS THAN SEVENTEEN

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:42.240
PERCENT. AND WHAT THAT IS

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.309
TELLING US IS THAT THERE ARE

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.877
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF.

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:48.380
FACILITIES IN JUST THOSE FIVE

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:50.749
COUNTIES. THAT NURSING PROGRAMS

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:53.818
ARE CURRENTLY NOT USING. TO

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:54.853
PROVIDE THIS CLINICAL

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.622
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS

00:25:57.689 --> 00:25:59.691
AND THIS REALLY REPRESENTS A

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:04.729
POTENTIALLY UNTAPPED SOURCE OF

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:05.330
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.365
SLOTS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:09.334
KNOW DOING THIS COMPARISON IS

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:12.837
NECESSARY WE RECOGNIZE THAT- IF

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.439
BEER AND STARTS TO DO THIS

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:15.540
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:16.975
FOLLOW UP WITH SOME OF THOSE

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:19.611
FACILITIES BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:20.612
THAT THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES

00:26:20.679 --> 00:26:22.781
THAT. THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:23.982
TO PROVIDE CLINICAL PLACEMENT

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.951
SLOTS ARE NOT STAFFED UP TO DO

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:28.086
IT BUT WE STILL THINK IT WOULD

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:30.155
BE WORTHWHILE FOR B. R. AND TO

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:32.290
PERIODICALLY OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.426
IS THAT THEY DO THIS ANNUALLY

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:35.527
STARTING IN OCTOBER OF THIS

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:37.896
YEAR. COMPARED BE CLINICAL

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.331
FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:42.100
OFFERING SLOTS FOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.935
NURSING STUDENTS. TO THE TOTAL

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:45.704
POPULATION OF FACILITIES AND

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.572
THEN DO THE FOLLOW UP TO SEE IF

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.941
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.343
PLACEMENT SLOTS THAT COULD BE

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:53.645
USED TO ALLEVIATE THIS

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.347
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT ON

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:57.148
ENROLLMENT FOR NURSING PROGRAMS

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:59.384
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT ARE

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.619
EXPERIENCING NURSING SHORTAGES.

00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:02.687
AGAIN B. R. AN AGREES

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:04.489
CONCEPTUALLY THEY AGREE THIS IS

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.623
A GOOD IDEA I THINK COULD BE

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.826
VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING

00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:09.761
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.696
SLOTS AND THEY'VE TOLD US IN

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:13.732
THEIR MOST RECENT- UPDATE IN

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.333
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THAT

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.536
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS. OF

00:27:18.603 --> 00:27:19.270
DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM SO. MAIN

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.306
CITIES AS A FALL ON AND WHAT

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:24.209
THE OUTCOME OF THAT WILL BE.

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.410
THIRTY ISSUE IN THIS REPORT

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.712
THIRD AND FINAL ISSUE IS THAT.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.514
WE FOUND THAT B. R. AND

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:32.183
APPROVAL. AND CONTINUING

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.353
OVERSIGHT OF THE- OF NURSING

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.055
PROGRAMS IS VERY SIMILAR TO

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:38.890
WHAT NATIONAL ACCREDITING

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.393
ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEALING. AND

00:27:41.459 --> 00:27:43.361
SO SPECIFICALLY WE FOUNDED B.

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:45.230
R. INS REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSING

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:48.867
PROGRAMS IN MANY AREAS. OVERLAP

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:50.635
THE STANDARDS THAT ARE IMPOSED

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.504
BY NATIONAL NURSING PROGRAM

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.873
ACCREDITORS AND- ENTERED INTO

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:56.708
EXTENDED THEY OVERLAP. THERE'S

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:59.811
DUPLICATION AND IT'S

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:01.813
INEFFICIENT. SO IF YOU AGAIN IF

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.281
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT PAGES TWO

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.849
AND THREE OF THE HANDOUT THAT

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:06.751
WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE. IT

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:08.186
WALKS THROUGH SOME OF THE

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.854
SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.790
BETWEEN B. R. ENDS PROCESS

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:14.726
VERSUS THE ACCREDITORS. AND AT

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.795
A HIGH LEVEL WHAT WE FOUND IS

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:19.697
THAT B. R. ENDS PROCESS FOR

00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:22.634
APPROVING BOTH NEW PROGRAMS THE

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.103
INITIAL APPROVAL PROCESS AND

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.337
FOR OVERSEEING EXISTING

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:30.742
PROGRAMS IS- THERE AND

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:32.243
BASICALLY OVERLAPS FAIRLY

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.279
SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:35.847
STANDARDS OF THESE ARE

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.550
CREDITORS. FOR EXAMPLE AS I

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.151
SHOWN IN THE IN THE HANDOUTS

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.487
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT- BOTH OF

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.022
THESE PROCESS SEASON BEERMAN'S

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.558
PROCESS AND YOUR CREDITORS IN

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:49.260
BOTH CASES. WE ARE VERIFYING

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:50.328
THAT THE NURSING PROGRAM

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:53.231
FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:54.866
QUALIFIED AND HAVE RELEVANT

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.535
EXPERIENCE. BUT ALSO VERIFYING

00:28:57.602 --> 00:28:58.570
OF NURSING PROGRAM HAS

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:01.039
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR BOTH

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:03.408
ITS STUDENTS AND FACULTY. IN

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.543
ADDITION THEY'RE BOTH ENSURE

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.479
CURRICULUM IS COMPREHENSIVE AND

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.715
INCLUDES THAT CLINICAL

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.316
EXPERIENCE THAT I WAS TALKING

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.617
ABOUT. THEY'RE ALSO CHECKING TO

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:13.985
MAKE SURE THAT NEVER NURSING

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:16.287
PROGRAMS ARE MAINTAINING A

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:18.189
MINIMUM PASS RATE FOR THE

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:20.125
LICENSURE EXAM. AND THOSE ARE

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.526
ALL OBVIOUSLY VERY KEY

00:29:21.593 --> 00:29:24.162
COMPONENTS OF ANY KIND OF

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:26.164
OVERSIGHT OF NURSING PROGRAMS

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.465
BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:28.199
THAT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:30.735
DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN B. RN'S

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:34.272
OVERSIGHT AND THE ACCREDITATION

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:37.375
FOR EXAMPLE. BUREN'S PRIMARY

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.577
MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:42.447
PUBLIC AND ENSURE THAT THESE

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.115
NURSING PROGRAMS ME ARMENIAN

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:46.551
STATE STANDARDS. WHILE ON THE

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.453
OTHER HAND THE ACCREDITORS

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.554
THEY'RE THEY'RE BASICALLY

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:50.955
MAKING SURE THEY'RE FOCUSING ON

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:53.124
THE QUALITY AND PROGRAM

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.759
EFFECTIVENESS FOR EACH OF THESE

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.728
PROGRAMS. THE OTHER THING I

00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:58.163
WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THE

00:29:58.229 --> 00:30:00.298
CREDITORS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:02.367
AUTHORITY TO CLOSE A NURSING

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:05.003
PROGRAM DOWN THAT DOESN'T MEET

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.504
THEIR STANDARDS WELL BURKE

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:09.941
BOARDS OF NURSING DO YOU HAVE

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:10.942
THAT AUTHORITY. THE OTHER THING

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:12.744
I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT FOR

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.978
NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.880
OF CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:17.749
REQUIRED TO GET THE BOARD OF

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.617
REGISTERED NURSING APPROVAL IN

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:22.387
ORDER TO OPERATE WHEREAS THAT'S

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:23.788
NOT THE CASE OR ACCREDITATION

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:26.024
IN CALIFORNIA ACCREDITATION OF

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.127
NURSING PROGRAMS IT'S OPTIONAL.

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.595
AND AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:32.864
ONLY ROUGHLY HALF OF THE

00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:35.033
NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:36.634
ARE ACTUALLY A CREDIT.

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:39.337
NOTWITHSTANDING WE BELIEVE THAT

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.806
ALIGNING THE STATE REVIEW

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:44.309
PROCESS WITH ACCREDITATION IT

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.010
MAKES SENSE AND WE DON'T THINK

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.446
IT'S UNCOMMON AND WE IDENTIFIED

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:50.748
SEVERAL OTHER CALIFORNIA.

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.517
HEALING ARTS BOARDS THAT

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.319
ACTUALLY ALREADY DOING THAT IT

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:56.554
RELY ON ACCREDITATION IN SOME

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:59.357
CASES AND IN OTHER CASES THEY

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:01.459
THEY COLLABORATE WITH THEIR THE

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:03.761
ACCREDITORS AND SO. A COUPLE OF

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.196
EXAMPLES THE MEDICAL BOARD OF

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:07.899
CALIFORNIA. THE OSTEOPATHIC

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.334
MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THE

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.336
PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT BOARD THE

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:13.538
DENTAL HYGIENE BOARD THEY ARE

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:15.340
ALL RELYING ON ACCREDITATION

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.041
EITHER IN PLACE OR IN

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.776
CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR OWN

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:21.179
OVERSIGHT. ANY OTHER THING I

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.380
JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT HERE

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:24.382
TOWARDS THE END IS THAT THIS

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.452
COLLABORATION BETWEEN STATES

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:28.286
AND ACCREDITORS IT'S

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:30.688
ENCOURAGED. THE NATIONAL

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:33.291
COUNCIL OF STATE BOARDS AND THE

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:34.492
NATIONAL COUNCIL STATE BOARDS

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.128
OF NURSING. THEY RECOMMEND THE

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.130
BOARDS OF NURSING SHOULD BE

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.500
WORKING TOWARDS HARMONIZING-

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.501
WILL PROCESS WITH THE CREDITORS

00:31:43.568 --> 00:31:46.938
BECAUSE IT MAKE SENSE. SO AS

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.807
PART OF. THIS SUNSET REVIEW

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:52.210
PROCESS IN THE REPORT WE

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:53.811
RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:56.047
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. AS A PART

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.715
OF THIS PROCESS WHETHER B. R.

00:31:57.782 --> 00:31:58.783
AND SHOULD REVISE ITS

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.819
REGULATIONS TO LEVERAGE THE

00:32:01.886 --> 00:32:03.187
PORTIONS OF THE ACCREDITORS

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:06.124
REVIEW WHERE THERE IS OVERLAP.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.992
AND WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:09.394
ACCREDITATION IS AN EXACT

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.462
REPLACEMENT FOR B. R. IN THE

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.230
OVERSIGHT WE KNOW THAT'S NOT

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:14.399
THE CASE. BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:15.533
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.038
RESTRUCTURE B. R. AND OVERSIGHT.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.773
TO TO REDUCE ANY DUPLICATION OF

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:23.074
EFFORT AND WE THINK IT'S

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:25.610
POSSIBLE TO DO THAT TO REDUCE

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:27.245
THE DUPLICATION. SHE WOULD

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:28.680
SHE'D SOME COST SAVINGS AND

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.982
EFFICIENCIES WHILE ALLOWING BE

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:32.950
ARE AND TO STILL ACHIEVE ITS

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:33.484
MISSION OF PROTECTING THE

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.820
PUBLIC. SO IN TERMS OF BE

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:38.122
AARON'S RESPONSE THE- THIS IS A

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:39.490
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE TO

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:41.092
THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.694
CONSIDER THIS AS PART OF THIS

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.063
SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS. BUT B.

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:46.497
ARE INDEED INDICATE THAT THEY

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:49.467
ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA. AND

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:50.635
THEY SUGGESTED THAT THEY'RE

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.603
WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.239
IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING ANY

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.141
THIS DUPLICATION OF OVERSIGHT

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.577
BETWEEN THEIR OVERSIGHT NOW OUT

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.746
OF THE ACCREDITORS. AND AGAIN I

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.247
WOULD DEFER TO BE OUR ENDS

00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.616
EXECUTIVES TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:07.719
ON THAT LATER IN THE HEARING.

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:09.320
THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:10.955
WITHOUT I'M I CAN ANSWER ANY

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.223
QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBER

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.859
COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU

COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED

00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:20.598
QUESTIONS I THOUGHT IT MIGHT

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.734
ASK A FEW. JUST A VERY FEW

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.936
FOUNDATIONAL QUESTIONS WITH

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:27.638
RESPECT TO THE COMPLAINT DELAY

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:33.911
SPECIFICALLY PM FOR WHICH IS

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:36.147
THE FORMAL COMPLAINT PROCESS.

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:37.849
WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE AS

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.618
BETWEEN THE B. R. IN DCA OR THE

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.653
END OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.889
WHICH OF THOSE ENTITIES ARE

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:48.426
AGENCIES WERE. RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:50.495
THE DELAY IN PROCESSING FORMAL

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:55.767
COMPLAINTS. YES SENATOR ROCKS

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.735
SO WHAT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.437
THAT THE CRITERIA SET BY THE

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:00.838
DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:02.740
BUT IN OUR AUDIT WHAT WE FOUND

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:05.076
ISTHE DELAY WAS IT APPEARED TO

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.044
BE OCCURRING WITH THE BOARD OF

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.147
REGISTERED NURSING. BET THERE

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.082

THEY WERE JUST WERE NOT

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:15.153
TRIAGING THESE COMPLAINTS AND

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.888
EITHER ASSIGNING THEM TO THEIR

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:19.357
OWN INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS OR

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:20.558
THEY'RE ACTUALLY REQUIRED

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:21.726
THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.395
REQUIRES THEM TO ASSIGN ANY

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:26.330
COMPLAINTS. THERE ARE HIGH

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.965
PRIORITY OR URGENT THOUGH

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:30.601
SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO CONSUMER.

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.403
SWORN INVESTIGATORS SO REALLY

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.639
THE DELAY WAS STARTING WITH THE

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.474
BOARD AND THEIR EFFORTS TO

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.576
TRIAGE THESE COMPLAINTS AND

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.011
EITHER ASSIGN THEM TO THEIR OWN

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:43.915
INVESTIGATORS OR TO CONSUMER.

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.683
THANK YOU- NOW WITH RESPECT TO

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.552
THE PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS IN

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.153
THE SUPPLY OF A NURSES IN THE

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.623
STATE. AS PART OF YOUR AUDIT

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:54.759
BEYOND ENSURING THE PUBLIC

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.527
SAFETY IN NURSING PRACTICE AND

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:59.230
TRYING TO PREVENT A SHORTAGE OF

00:34:59.297 --> 00:34:59.997
NURSES IN THE STATE OF

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:02.066
CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF THE B.

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:05.369
R. ENDS ACTIVITIES BEYOND THAT.

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:07.705
WERE YOU ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.507
THE BOARD'S INTENT OR PURPOSE.

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.442
WHAT IS OR ISN'T TRYING TO

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.545
ENSURE THAT. THERE'S NO SURPLUS

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:19.517
OF NURSES IN THE STATE. I SURE

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.018
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT THE

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:23.354
YEAR ENDS CONSULTANT WAS DOING

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.189
IN TERMS OF THE BI ANNUAL

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:28.159
FORECAST. THE PROBLEM AGAIN IS

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:30.261
IT WAS A STATE WIDE FORECASTS

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.729
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.965
FEW FORECAST THEY WERE VERY

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:36.033
SIMILAR THIS TWO THOUSAND

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.101
SEVENTEEN FORECAST PROJECTED AT

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:39.203
BALLOT STATEWIDE BETWEEN SUPPLY

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.672
AND DEMAND. TWO THOUSAND

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.608
NINETEEN ACTUALLY SUGGESTED

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.175
THAT THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:49.480
SURPLUS OF NURSES I BELIEVE IN

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.047
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AGAIN ON

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:51.582
STATEWIDE LEVEL. BUT WHEN WE

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.618
DRILL DOWN AND LOOK AT SOME OF

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.119
THESE OTHER REPORTS AND BY THE

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.654
WAY ONE OF THESE OTHER REPORTS

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:59.557
ALSO CAME FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:00.892
AND IN FACT WAS PUT TOGETHER

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.827
BY. THE SAME CONSULTANT THAT

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.096
THE BOARD USES BUT IT INCLUDED

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.531
A REGIONAL ANALYSIS WHEN WE

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.866
LOOKED AT BACK. WE FOUND THAT

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:11.068
THERE WERE MANY REGIONS IN THE

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.570
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:15.406
SHORTAGE OF NURSES RIGHT NOW

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.508
AND ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE A

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.010
SHORTAGE IN TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:20.278
I GUESS MY QUESTION GOES TO

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:26.651
THIS I MEAN AND THE BOARD'S. IS

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.085
IT IS OCCASIONALLY HAVING A

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.687
SURPLUS OF NURSES A BAD THING

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.856
AND I WAS ASKING REALLY. IF YOU

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.590
WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:34.859
DETERMINE WHAT THE MOTIVATION

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.894
IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE WHERE. WE

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.663
DON'T WANT TO SURPLUS OF NURSES

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.031
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:43.100
BECAUSE- IT DRIVES DOWN

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.669
SALARIES THAT DOES SOMETHING

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.905
ELSE. MAYBE THAT WAS BEYOND THE

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.173
SCOPE OF YOUR AUDIT BUT IT'S

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.808
CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE USING

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.577
SHORTAGE VERSUS SURPLUS TO

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:53.844
DETERMINE WHETHER SCHOOL NEW

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:54.979
SCHOOLS ARE APPROVED OR

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.348
EXISTING SCHOOLS CAN EXPAND I

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:58.849
UNDERSTAND SHORTAGE BEING A

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.184
FACTOR I AM HAVING A DIFFICULT

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:02.520
TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW SURPLUS

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:04.689
IS A FACTOR IN THAT DECISION.

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:05.690
DID THAT COME UP AT ALL IN YOUR

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:08.793
AUDIT. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.328
THAT DID THE PROBLEM THAT WE

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:12.997
REALLY NOTED IS THAT THE BOARD

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:14.799
DOESN'T WHEN THEY'RE MAKING

00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:18.102
THESE DECISIONS TO APPROVE A

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:19.503
NEW NURSING PROGRAMS OR TO

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.938
INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT THE

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:23.541
REAL ROOT PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS.

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.443
THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:27.111
TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS SO

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.080
LET FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS A

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:31.115
NOR IF THERE IS A NURSING

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.883
PROGRAM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.051
THAT HAS SUBMITTED AN

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.786
APPLICATION TO INCREASE

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:36.554
ENROLLMENT BY A HUNDRED

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.489
STUDENTS. THE BOARD WHEN THEY

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:39.957
MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER TO

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.659
IMPROVE THAT WRONG THEY DON'T

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.361
HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:45.296
THAT AREA ALREADY HAS A

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:47.632
SHORTAGE OF NURSES OR A SURPLUS

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.367
OF NURSES AND OR HOW THAT

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.901
SITUATION IS PROJECTED TO BE

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.137
DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE SO THAT

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.506
WAS. OUR CONCERN WAS THE BOARD

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.774
DOESN'T EVEN SEEM TO HAVE A

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.042
HANDLE ON WHETHER THERE ARE

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.277
SHORTAGES OR SURPLUSESIN

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:02.079
SPECIFIC REGIONS IN THE STATE

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.881
OKAY THANK YOU LET ME MOVE ON

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.349
SO I CAN TURN IT OVER TO MY

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.183
COLLEAGUES FOR MORE DETAILED

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.718
QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.654
CLINICAL PLACEMENT I GATHER

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.656
FROM YOUR REPORT THAT SLOTS

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.691
CLINICAL SLUDGE. MAY OCCUR AT

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.726
BOTH HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AT

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:19.330
LEAST. IN SOME CASES IS THAT

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:20.264
CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.632
THEN ON ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.134
YOUR OTHER REPORT I FOUND YOUR

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.802
CHART INTERESTING. WHERE

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.504
APPARENTLY THERE WAS A SURVEY

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.240
AND IF MY MATH IS CORRECT.

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.541
SIXTY FOUR OF ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.709
PROGRAMS THAT WERE SURVEYED

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.211
REFLECTED THAT THE REASON. FOR

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:36.113
CLINICAL SLOT DISPLACEMENT WAS

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:46.657
SOMETHING. OTHER THAN ANOTHER

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.125
NURSING PRO TO. THE FLOOD THAT

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:50.494
THAT PART OF EUROPE. YEAH

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.163
THAT'S DID WE DIDN'T THERE WERE-

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:52.763
NUMBER OF REASON WE TOOK LOOK

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.565
AT. THAT WE- THIS. AND I THAT'S

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.800
OVER SHOWING IN AND OUT FIGURE

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.334
ON PAGE TWO TWO. AND WE DID FOR

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.769
THAT THERE WERE NO OF RE SO-

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.137
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE I THINK

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:02.139
THERE WAS. THE PROGRAMS THAT

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:03.574
REPORTED CHOICE REPORTED THAT

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.109
THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.077
THREE HUNDRED NURSING STUDENTS

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:08.279
THAT WERE DISPLACED. BUT YOU'RE

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:11.082
RIHT IT WAS NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:13.350
THOSE STUDENTS GOT BOMBS BY

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:14.752
STUDENTS FROM OTHER PROGRAMS

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.153
THERE WERE OTHER REASONS

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.155
SOMETIMES FACILITIES DECIDE

00:39:18.222 --> 00:39:20.658
THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE. THE

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.793
STAFFING. TO BASICALLY MAKE

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.863
THESE CLINICAL- SLOTS AVAILABLE

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.731
SO CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.699
REASONS. THAT I'VE FOUND WITH

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.935
RESPECT TO YOUR- REVIEW OF

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:33.504
THOSE SIXTEEN NURSING PROGRAMS

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.806
SORT OF FASCINATING THAT. OF

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:38.175
THE SLOTS 82% OF ACUTE CARE

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.177
HOSPITAL SLOTS IN THE BAY AREA

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.713
WERE USED BUT ONLY 10% OF THE

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.249
CLINIC SLOTS WERE UTILIZED FOR

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:46.684
NURSING TRAINING BY THOSE

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.718
PROGRAMS WERE YOU ABLE TO

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:50.855
DETERMINE WHY MORE CLINIC AS

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:52.590
OPPOSED TO CLINICAL CLINICS

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:57.495
SLOTS. WERE NOT USED. I THINK

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.897
WHAT WHAT WE NOTED THAT- AS HE

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.700
SAID THAT IT DOES APPEAR THAT

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.001
THE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE ARE

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:06.637
USING THE ACUTE CARE FACILITIES

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.139
MUCH MORE THAN THEY USE IN THE

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.741
OTHER CLINICS- I DON'T KNOW

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:12.543
THAT WE GOT AN EXPLANATION FOR

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.578
WHY THAT'S OCCURRING. BUT I

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.247
THINK THAT'S WHY WE THINK OUR

00:40:16.313 --> 00:40:19.049
RECOMMENDATION TO AT LEAST TAKE

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:21.185
A LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF NOT

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.721
JUST ACUTE CARE FACILITIES BUT

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:25.222
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLINICS.

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.924
THE CITY AND BE OUR SPOTS

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:29.326
DATABASE. AND I THINK WHAT B.

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:30.728
R. N. NEEDS TO DO IN

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:31.962
CONJUNCTION WITH THE NURSING

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.831
PROGRAMS IS REACH OUT TO SOME

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:36.200
OF THESE CLINICS. AND SEE IF

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:37.935
THERE WOULD BE WILLING TO

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:40.871
PROVIDE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND

00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.673
SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE. THE

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.308
RIGHT KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.010
WOULD PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE

00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.878
TYPES OF EXPERIENCE I THINK OUR

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.147
IMPRESSION IS THAT THAT JUST

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:53.017
HASN'T HAPPENED YET. YOU KNOW

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.585
GIVEN THE DATA THAT YOU

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:56.220
PROVIDED IN YOUR AUDIT REPORT

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.088
ON CLINICS LOTS WHERE THEY ARE

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.990
WHICH ONES ARE UTILIZED AND-

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.425
WHICH ONES APPARENTLY OR NOT

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:03.060
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TYPICALLY

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:04.795
UTILIZED AT LEAST IN THE AREAS

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.564
THAT YOU SURVEYED. WERE YOU

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.499
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.601
BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:13.003

DATA. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EVER

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:26.750
CAME UP I DON'T BELIEVE IN OUR

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.419
TESTING WE IDENTIFY THE

00:41:28.485 --> 00:41:31.388
SITUATION WHERE THE BOARD-

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.558
DECIDED NOT TO APPROVE EITHER A

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.460

ALSO REFERENCED EARLIER IN YOUR

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:38.756
IN YOUR TESTIMONY THE LACK OF

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.925
CONFIDENCE IT'S GIVEN THE-

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.060
MOVING PIECES IS THAT STILL THE

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:45.095
CASE TODAY WITH RESPECT TO. THE

TWENTY THEY SENT US A REPORT

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:07.685
AND SAID HEYWE'VE NOW RESOLVED

REPORT THAT THEY PROVIDED BACK

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.428
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THAT

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.662
THEY HAD MANIPULATED AND

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.965
FALSIFIED SO WE'RE IN THE

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:22.232

THEY SENT US BECAUSE- I MEAN

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.278
QUITE HONESTLY WE REALIZE NOW

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.479
THAT WE CAN'T TAKE THAT

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.314

OF DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE

AUDITOR'S OFFICE FOR A FULL

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:34.631
REPORT- SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.500
COME OUT OF THAT REPORT- SUCH

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.769
AS LACK OF DATA TO BE ABLE TO

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:39.903
MAKE PROPER DECISIONS IN ONE

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.006
AREA AND THEN LOW CONFIDENCE IN

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.575
ANOTHER AREA I DID HAVE A

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:47.911
QUESTION ABOUT- THE THERE WAS A

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.581
LIST THAT WAS DELIVERED OF. OF

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:53.717
DIFFERENT OTHER AGENCIES AND-

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:56.053
BOARDS AND HOW IT WAS

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.654
DESCRIBED- IT SOUNDED LIKE

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:58.822
THERE WAS A MUCH BETTER

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.858
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:05.996
CREDITORS SO IN. IN REFERENCE

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:08.298
TO BE ARE IN NGUYEN IS THE

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:10.367
JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR LACK OF

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:12.569
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:46:12.636 --> 00:46:15.239
CREDITOR IS A PHILOSOPHICAL IS

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:18.308
IT- IS A PROCESS THAT SEEMS TO

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:21.778
BE BROKEN. IS IT SOMETHING-

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.847
THAT. MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.482
ACTION ON UP WHAT IS IT THAT

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:27.551
WOULD- ADDRESS THAT MOST

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:31.622
EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH THE AUDIT

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.657
WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH- THE

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:36.226
BOARDS MANAGEMENT AND I THINK

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.361
THEY WANT THEIR THEY WANT TO

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:40.364
EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT THEIR-

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.399
THEIR MISSION IS DIFFERENT THAT

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:43.734
THEIR PRIMARY MISSION IS ALL

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.202
ABOUT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:47.738
ENSURING THAT. NURSING PROGRAMS

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.940
MEET STANDARDS WHICH WHICH IS

00:46:50.007 --> 00:46:53.410
FINE- BUT WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:54.244
LOOKED AT SOME OF THESE

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:56.246
ACCREDITORS THERE'S TWO PRIMARY

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:57.881
NATIONAL CREDITORS OUT THERE

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:59.650
AND WE FOUND THAT. THE

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.985
ACCREDITORS OFTENTIMES IN THEIR

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:04.555
REVIEWS THEY ARE ALSO CHECKING

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:05.622
TO MAKE SURE THAT NURSING

00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:07.724
PROGRAMS ARE HEARING TO STATE

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:10.527
REQUIREMENTS. SO WHAT I WOULD

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.196
SAY IS THAT DURING THE AUDIT I

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:14.898
THINK. THE BOARD WAS A LITTLE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:17.467
LESS OPEN TO THIS IDEA THAT

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:19.269
THERE WAS A DUPLICATION OF

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:21.505
EFFORTS. AND THAT IT IS

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.140
POSSIBLE LIKE YOU SAID TO HAVE

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.241
MORE OF A SYMBIOTIC

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:27.411
RELATIONSHIP AND TO REALLY I

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:28.245
THINK WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:30.814
HAPPENING IS THE BOARD SHOULD

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:31.548
BE COLLABORATING WITH YOUR

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.984
CREDITORS SO THAT BOTH SIDES

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.752
CAN STREAMLINE YOUR PROCESS

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.221
SEES AND ELIMINATE THE

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:39.489
DUPLICATION. BY THE TIME THAT

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:41.024
WE FINISH THE AUDIT IN THE

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.326
BOARD'S ACTUAL OFFICIAL

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.561
RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT. THEY I

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:45.896
THINK THEY HAD SORT OF COME

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:47.931
ALONG AND AGREED THAT IT MAKES

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:49.933
SENSE AND EVEN THOUGH WE MADE A

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.268
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION OF

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.804
THE LEGISLATURE. CONSIDER

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.906
REVISING THE BOARD'S RAGS TO

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:58.141
ELIMINATE HIS DUPLICATION AT

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.611
THE END OF BOARD SAID THAT THEY

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:01.345
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON

00:48:01.411 --> 00:48:03.413
THIS THEY LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.317
OVERLAP. AND COME UP WITH A

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:15.058
PLAN TO ADDRESS IT. THANK YOU.

IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION. AS WE

STARTED AN INVESTIGATION RIGHT

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:05.275
AWAY. AND AS I SAID IT ALL OVER

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:06.743
FUTURE DEALINGS WITH THE BOARD

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.612
OF REGISTERED NURSING. WE ARE

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.580
GOING TO BE EVEN MORE VIGILANT

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:11.615
THAN WE NORMALLY ARE TO MAKE

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:16.186
SURE THAT WE CAN RELY ON ANY

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:16.786
INFORMATION THAT THEY PROVIDE

TO GET TO IS. YOU KNOW WHAT THE

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:22.092
SIX IS THAT REALLY A CULTURE.

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.660
THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:25.729
ABSOLUTE TOP TO BOTTOM EIGHT

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:26.429

SOUNDS LIKE. A BOARD THAT IS.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.169
NOT FULLY DETERMINED TO YOU

REACHES I BELIEVE CRIMINAL

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:43.647
LEVELS OF- FRIED. AND YET WE

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.448
HAVE NOT SEEN IT DOES NOT SOUND

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:46.583
LIKE YOU'RE DESCRIBING A WHOLE

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.018
HEARTED EFFORT TO CHANGE THE

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.486
CULTURE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:51.721
THIS AND MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:52.322

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:54.624

THEIR RESPONSE THEY DID OF THE

00:54:58.361 --> 00:54:59.663
THREE EXECUTIVES THAT REALLY.

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:02.365
KIND OF MASTERMIND THIS CLAN TO

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:03.533
REALLY DECEIVE US BY

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.602
MANIPULATING DATA. YEAH THEY

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.437
DID. THEY DID DISMISS TWO OF

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:08.905
THOSE EMPLOYEES AND ONE HAD

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.074
ALREADY LEFT- ONE THING I COULD

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.876
PROBABLY DO RIGHT NOW IS. IS

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.611
BASICALLY DIFFERENT THIS OVER

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:17.514
TO YOU MR TRUMP. SHE WAS THE-

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.315
MANAGER THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.350
FOR THE INVESTIGATION AND SHE

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:21.918
MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. A

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.387
LITTLE MORE COMMENTS ON ON

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:28.324
BILLBOARDS- REACTION TO THE

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:36.266
FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION.

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:38.134
CNN TRONG THE BY AND THE CHIEF

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:40.270
OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:40.804
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.606
OFFICE. AND TO FOLLOW UP MISTER

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:46.976
CHILDREN SAID- AND TO ANSWER-

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:49.312
THE QUESTION AT HAND IS THAT-

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.147
WE DO NOT CONSIDER IT AT THE

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.883
TIME A CRIMINAL MATTER- BECAUSE

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.385
OF THE TYPE OF DATA THAT WAS

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:57.887
TURNED OVER TO US. SO WE DIDN'T

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:58.655
LOOK AT IT FROM A CRIMINAL

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.590
PERSPECTIVE- THAT'S SOMETHING

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.826
OBVIOUSLY THAT WE- COULD

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.527
CONSIDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE

00:56:04.594 --> 00:56:06.496
COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION-

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.665
BUT BECAUSE OF THE SPECIFICS OF

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.433
THE INVESTIGATION WE DID NOT

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.701
FEEL THAT IT WAS A CRIMINAL

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:14.471
MATTER AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:15.739
CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION.

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.006
BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.074
WHETHER OR NOT A CRIMINAL

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.342
SANCTIONS ARE PROBABLY I GUESS

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.544
I GUESS THE QUESTION. IS DO YOU

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.880
FEEL LIKE THERE IS A CULTURAL

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.915
PROBLEM. WITH THE B. R. AND-

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:28.451

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.385

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:32.021
IS. ACTING DILIGENTLY AND

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.190
AGGRESSIVELY TO ROOT OUT THE

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:37.260
CAUSES OF THIS TYPE OF PROBLEMS

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.528
AND IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:40.563
BECAUSE I GUESS MY ANALOG HERE

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.332
MIGHT SORT REFERENCE POINT. IS

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.600
DID THIS HAPPEN IN THE PRIVATE

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.201
SECTOR WE WOULD BE REPLACING

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:46.536

RIGHT NOW. THAT THERE'S AN

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:55.345
AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE

THE LAW DOESN'T HAPPEN. I

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:05.722

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.480
THAT WHISTLEBLOWER. IN TILL THE

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.048
BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY SO

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.717
THERE WAS ABOUT A FOURTEEN

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.651
MONTH LAG BETWEEN THE TIME

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:24.620
THAT. B. R. AND- MANIPULATED

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.122
THE DATA TO PROVIDE THE

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:27.523
FALSIFIED REPORT AND THEN IT

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.225
WAS LIKE. TWELVE TO FOURTEEN

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.593
MONTHS LATER. THEIR

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.161
WHISTLEBLOWER CAME OUT AND

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:33.863
REYES THE ALLEGATION OKAY SO

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.732
THAT THE SERVICE IN TWENTY

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:38.701
EIGHTEEN WHEN. THIS

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:39.502
MANIPULATION TOOK PLACE. AT

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.770
OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN THE

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:43.272
SECOND QUESTION IS THAT- NOT

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.774
REALLY TO THIS BUT- I

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.175
APPRECIATE THAT YOU TOOK A LOOK

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.877
AT THE CLINICAL SITES I THINK

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.312
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT- SAYING

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.280
THAT YOU LOOKED AT. ALTHOUGH AS

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.515
A SOMEONE WHO'S A HEALTH

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.150
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATOR MYSELF

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:56.119
THAT'S A DEAL CLINICAL SITES. I

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:58.254
KNOW YOU LOOK AT OSHKOSH DATA

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.356
WAS THERE ANY EFFORT ATTEMPTS

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.924
MADE AND I KNOW FOR A ON THE

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:05.028
HARD TO DO. TO EVALUATE THE

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.764
WILLINGNESS OF VARIOUS SITES TO

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.332
ACTUALLY ACCEPTS TRAINEES

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.467
BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.301
AT HOW MANY LICENSED CLINICAL

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:16.973
SITE- LET'S SEE. HOW MANY

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.275
LICENSED- HELPER. SITES TO ARE

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:21.010
TRACKED CYCLE SAFETY BUT THEY

01:01:21.077 --> 01:01:22.211
MAY NOT ALL WANT TO HAVE A

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.847
NURSE TRAINEE SO. THAT MAY ALSO

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:27.083
AFFECT SO. DID YOU JUST LOOK AT

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.518
THE OXFORD DATA OR DID YOU WAS

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.153
THERE ANY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.988
ABOUT TAKE A LOOK AT. EITHER

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.389
THE WILLINGNESS OR THE

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:36.526
EXISTING- OR THE DEGREE TO

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.027
WHICH OFFICIALLY BE ACTUALLY

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:41.864
WILLING TO TAKE ON A NURSE

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:42.465
TRAINEE AS A CLINICAL TRAINING

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.834
SITES. WE KNOWLEDGE CENTER

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:47.937
REPORT THAT- EVEN THOUGH WE DID

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:50.206
IN THE BAY AREA IDENTIFY. A

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.108
LARGE NUMBER OF- FACILITIES

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.810
THAT WERE NOT BEING USE WEEK WE

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.678
DO ACKNOWLEDGE IN OUR RECORDS

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.480
THAT IT COULD BE THAT MANY OF

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.782
THOSE- FACILITIES THEY DON'T

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.484
WANT TO PARTICIPATE THEY DON'T

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.086
WANT TO OFFER CLINICAL

01:02:03.152 --> 01:02:05.021
PLACEMENTS WHAT'S THE NURSING

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:08.257
PROGRAM STUDENTS WHERE THEY-DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO DO

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.158
IT THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.027
REASONS. AND CERTAINLY THE

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.829
BOARD BROUGHT THAT UP I MEAN

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.664
THEY AGREED THAT YES WE

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.998
IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:18.134
FACILITIES AND IN ONE AREA THE

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.169
AREA. THAT WE'RE NOT BEING

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.638
TAPPED. BUT THEY MADE THE SAME

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.173
CASE THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.541
UNUSED FACILITIES WOULD BE

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:26.976
WILLING TO PARTICIPATE OR WOULD

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.178
HAVE THE ABILITY OUR POINT WAS

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:31.147
JUST BECAUSE WE IDENTIFIED JUST

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.583
MISS ONE REGION SO MANY

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.051
FACILITIES THAT WERE NOT BEING

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:37.353
USED. WE THINK IT'S AT LEAST

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.921
WORTH WHILE FOR B. R. AND TO

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.324
WORK WITH THE NURSING PROGRAMS

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.292
AND GO THROUGH THIS COMPARISON

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.760
AND IDENTIFY THESE FACILITIES

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.095
IN CALIFORNIA THAT AREN'T BEING

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.431
USED AND REACH OUT TO SOME OF

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.233
THEM HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS. TO

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.767
SEE IF THERE ARE SOME

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.202
FACILITIES OUT THERE THAT ARE

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.670
NOT BEING USED THAT WOULD BE

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.939
AMENABLE TO OFFERING TOP

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.341
CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN NURSING

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.243
PROGRAM STUDENTS ARE NOT

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.245
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:02.979
CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.714
FINDING THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.082
REALLY BEEN CONSIDERING THAT IS

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.151
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- WE

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.785
DON'T WANT TO DO IS A PROOF-

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:10.887
TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:11.888
PEOPLE CASH ACTUALLY CAN'T

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:12.889
COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING BECAUSE

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:13.756
THEY DON'T HAVE A CLINICAL

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.958
SITES. SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.493
NOT LOOKING AT THAT AND

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.995
APPROVALS IS VERY PROBLEM IS

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.563
VERY TROUBLESOME TO ME BECAUSE

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.098
I DON'T WANT DON'T WANT TWENTY

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.699
STOCK THE SAME TIME I CERTAINLY

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.270
UNDERSTAND. THAT UNFORTUNATELY

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.238
MANY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES NO

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:30.473
LONGER WANT TREES BECAUSE THEY

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.108
COST MONEY I MEAN IT THE EVEN

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:32.942
IF YOU DON'T TO PAY FOR THE

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.577
TRAINEES THAT THAT THE OVERHEAD

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.080
TIME FOR TEACHING AND- IT'S AT-

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.216
ENDS AND IN FACT- THAT'S A

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.517
CHRONIC PROBLEM NOT ONLY

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.019
NURSING BUT ACROSS THE HEALTH

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.187
PROFESSIONS WHERE DOES FEELING

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.122
FEWER. HEALTH FACILITIES

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:46.956
WILLING TO TAKE ON TRAINEES

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:53.029
BECAUSE OF. THE EXPENSE AND

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.430
DAHLE CERTAIN OF SIDE KNOW

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.264
DESTROY. THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH A

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.899
TREE NEED. ANY OTHER SKILL

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.068
LEVEL CETERA. AND- SO THAT'S A-

01:03:59.135 --> 01:03:59.902
FROM BUT CERTAINLY AGREETHAT

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.572
THE BOARD. SHOULD THE CERTAINLY

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.173
EVALUATE THAT BECAUSE NOTHING

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.975
ELSE WE WANNA BE SURE A TRAINEE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:06.876
IS ABLE ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEIR

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:07.810
TRAINING THEY CAN'T GET A

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:09.612
CLINICAL SITES AND- WORKED AT

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.380

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.616
OF THAT STUDENTS OF THANK YOU

AUDIT. FIND IN DETERMINE THAT

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.336
THE BOARD WAS NOT. UTILIZING

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.404
THE DATA THAT IS. IT HAD

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.305
COLLECTED CAN TO PERIODICALLY

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.274
pHIS OF THE PROCESS EITHER FOR

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:39.709
THE APPLE OF A NEW PROGRAM. OR

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:40.676

TO DO WITH CLINICAL SLOTS IN

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.779
THE AVAILABILITY OF. CLINICAL

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.348
**** IN PARTICULAR REGIONS OF

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:48.584
THE STATE. THAT'S CORRECT

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.087
MISTER CHAIRMAN IN ORDER FOR

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:53.122
THE BOARD TO EVEN. DO A

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.024
COMPARISON OF THE EXTENT TO

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.993
WHICH- FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.395
BEING USED BY NURSING PROGRAMS.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:02.565
VERSUS THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.200
POTENTIAL FACILITIES. THEY

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:06.636
FIRST HAVE TO HAVE A HANDLE ON

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.871
WHAT FACILITIES ARE CURRENTLY

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:11.574
BEING USED ACROSS THE STATE BY

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:12.875
THE START STATE'S NURSING

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:15.911
PROGRAMS. AND THEY NEED DATA ON

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.414
HOW MANY SLOTS ARE BEING USED.

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:20.383
VERSUS HOW MANY SLOTS TO THE

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.585
NURSING PROGRAMS NEED SO WE CAN

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.587
MINIMIZE THIS RISK OF STUDENTS

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.889
BEING DISPLACED. BUT AS YOU BUT

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:28.691
AS YOU SAID RIGHT NOW THE BOARD

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.426
DOESN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:30.960
SO THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.262
HANDLE RIGHT NOW ON THE EXTENT

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:35.965
TO WHICH- NURSING PROGRAMS ARE

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.933
USING FACILITIES AND WHICH ONES

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.369
THEY'RE USING. AND THAT'S HAS

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.904
TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY CAN

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:45.908
COMPARE IT TO THE ENTIRE

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:46.509

IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:43.265

THE ABILITY OF ALL OF THE

SEPARATE ISSUES THAT ARE

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:10.592
CONSIDERED- DURING THE DECISION

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:13.228

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.296
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. I

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:18.266
UNDERSTAND. SHORTAGE BUT NOT

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:19.468
SOMETHING THAT GOES BEYOND

BECAUSE I WANT MY COLLEAGUES TO

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.705
HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO ASK MORE

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:26.041
DETAILED QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.309
TO THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:30.312
ISSUE WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.080
THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.549
WHERE WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:35.751
SIXTEEN PROGRAMS IN THE BAY

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:40.055
AREA- 82% OF THE ACUTE CARE

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.890
HOSPITAL SLOTS FOR USE BUT ONLY

CLINICAL BUT CLINIC SLOTS WERE

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:52.267
USED. IS IT PROVE THAT. CLINIC

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.903
SLOTS GO UNUSED IN THE STATE OF

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.271
CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.939
CLINICAL PLACEMENT OF NURSING

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:01.877
TRAINEES. YES THAT IS TRUE

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:04.246
THERE ARE MANY MANY CLINICS AND

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:05.781
OTHER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.483
THAT ARE NOT USED FOR- CLINICAL

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.819
EXPERIENCE SPECIFICALLY RELATED

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:11.720
TO THE REGISTERED NURSING

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:14.356
STUDENT- THE GOAL FOR PREPARING

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.358
A REGISTERED NURSING STUDENT IN

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:19.361
CALIFORNIA IS TO PROPERLY EQUIP

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.530
THEM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.432
REQUISITE SKILLS TO BE A SAFE

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.567
PRACTICING OUR AND- THAT

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:29.905
REQUIREMENTS- IS AIDED BY THAT

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:31.273
DIRECT PATIENT CARE CLINICAL

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:35.077
EXPERIENCE. MOST- LET ME

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:37.679
CORRECT THAT MANY CLINICS- MAY

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:40.215
NOT EMPLOY IN OUR AT- MAY NOT

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.584
HAVE THOSE KIND OF EXPERIENCES

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.586
AVAILABLE FOR AN HOUR AND A LOT

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.856
OF- PHYSICIAN CLINICS HAVE

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.092
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE- SOME

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.327
EMPLOYEE- A LICENSED VOCATIONAL

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.263
NURSE BUT RARELY DO THEY EMPLOY

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:58.266
A SPECIFIC R. AND FOR- ARE IN

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.435
SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE ATTAINMENT.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.971
THEREFORE A CLINIC THERE'S MANY

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:04.573
REASONS THAT CLINIC MAY NOT BE

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:07.409
YEARS IT COULD BE THAT- THERE

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.577
WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE ARE AN

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:11.713
OVERSIGHT THAT- THE CLINIC IT

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:14.416
MAY NOT. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:15.750
APPROPRIATE CLINICAL

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.986
EXPERIENCES THE CLINICAL

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:19.554
EXPERIENCES ARE SET FORTH BY

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.523
THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION WHEN

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.591
THEY WRITE THEIR GOALS AND

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:23.992
OBJECTIVES FOR THE CLINICAL

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:26.228
EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR STUDENTS-

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:27.929
AND THEN IT JUST MAY BE THE

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:31.366
INABILITY OF THE THAT CLINIC TO

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.468
ACCOMMODATE THAT I WAS-

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.770
MENTIONED EARLIER- BY ONE OF

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:39.307
THE MEMBERS HERE. THAT SOME

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.408
CLINICS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.811
DO THAT- THERE IS A SUPPLY

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.813
ISSUE WE DID SEE THAT EXPRESSED

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.014
WITH COOPERATE WITH GETTING

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.382
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:50.819
PPE ESE- AND THAT- TYPICALLY

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.421
COMES FROM THAT INSTITUTION

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.656
THAT IS PROVIDING THE CLINICAL

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:57.592
EXPERIENCE AND SO- DO YOU TO

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:58.793
THE ORIENTATION THAT HAS TO BE

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.395
PROVIDED AT THE TIME AWAY FROM

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:02.297
STAFF AND PRODUCTIVITY. THE

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.899
INCREASED ADEQUATE MAKE YOU

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.668
STANDS- AND NOW SPACE WITH THE

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:09.104
SOCIAL DISTANCING- IT HAS BEEN

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.906
VERY DIFFICULT FOR ACADEMIC

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:16.077
PARTNERS TO OBTAIN CLINICAL.

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:16.711
FACILITIES FOR THEIR STUDENTS.

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:17.546
WELL I WOULD HAVE THAT YOU

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:19.047
AGREE THE- DEMAND FOR HEALTH

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:22.250
CARE WORKERS. THE REGARDLESS OF

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.486
THESE STUDIES THAT I SEE- AT

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.754
LEAST IN SOME PARTS OF THE

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.256
STATE WILL CONTINUE- AND THE

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:31.793
SHORTAGE OF. HOSPITAL ****

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.729
PAROLEE. PROBABLY MORE SO IN

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:40.001
THE FUTURE. I THINK THE BEER IN

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.036
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:42.437
OF THESE CLINICS SETTINGS TO

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:45.407
SEE WHAT REALLY IS THE STORY.

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:47.776
WHAT TRULY IS APPROPRIATE AND

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.978
INAPPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF UGH

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:52.647
CLINICAL SLOT. CLINIC SLOTS

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.150
USAGE. THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT A

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:58.119
WAY TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:00.188
IN THESE CLINICS WHETHER THEIR

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:03.391
URGENT CARE CLINICS OR OTHER-

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.459
CLINICS IN THE STATE OF

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.228
CALIFORNIA SO WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:08.163
WE PROVIDE. AS MANY TRAINING

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.233
OPPORTUNITIES AS WE CAN FOR OUR

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.468
NURSING STUDENTS NOW I REALIZE

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:14.169
AND RECOGNIZE IT GIVEN THE

01:21:14.236 --> 01:21:16.037
SUBJECTS THAT. NURSE NURSE

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:19.574
STUDENTS MISSING STUDENTS HAVE

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:21.042
TO TRAIN IN THAT SOME NEED TO

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:22.944
BE DONE SOME TRAINING NEEDS TO

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.012
BE DONE ABSOLUTELY IN THE

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.880
HOSPITAL'S PERHAPS MUCH OF IT

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:28.316
BUT THERE IS PROBABLY SOME OF

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.851
IT THAT CAN BE DONE. ELSEWHERE

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:32.320
LET ME TURN BRIEFLY BEFORE I

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.122
PUT MY COLLEAGUES TO SLEEP TO.

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.424
LICENSE RECIPROCITY THIS IS AN

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.693
ISSUE THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.294
MY HEART PARTICULARLY WHEN IT

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:43.031
COMES TO. MILITARY OF FAMILY

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:45.400
MEMBERS WHO- TRANSFER INTO THIS

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.969
STATE WITH THEIR- MILITARY

MEMBER SPOUSE. FULLY LICENSED-

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.807

TRAINING LICENSURE AND

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:59.648
EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES. BUT

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:00.148
ONE OF THE ISSUES IN OUR

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:02.384
BACKGROUND PAPER. NOTES THAT

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:06.488
THE RECIPROCITY PROCESS. CAN BE

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:10.525
LENGTHY. HOW LENGTHY IS THE

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.527
RECIPROCITY PROCESS IN

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:18.400
CALIFORNIA. AND IF IT IS WHY. I

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:21.102
HAVE SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS-

01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:22.671
IF YOU DON'T MIND IS THAT OKAY

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:26.207

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:44.512
RATE OF OVER A 100% PROBABLY

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:47.115
LIKE A HUNDRED TWENTY OR A 130%

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.483
AND THEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.752
ANALYSTS WHICH I SAID WAS

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:52.553
400-500-0600 FOR HOURLY RATE-

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:53.654
TO TYPE IN FOR A SENIOR

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.590
LEGISLATIVE LEGAL ANALYST IS

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.658
ONLY 810-002-0050 TWO SO

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:01.896
THEREFORE DEBTS AND OVER THREE

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:02.530
HUNDRED PERCENT. OVERHEAD RATE.

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.432
SO SO REALIZE THE FOR THE BOARD

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:05.566
OF NURSING I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.635
HERE IS THAT- GIVEN THE FACT

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:09.237
THAT YOU ARE COLLECTING FEES

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:11.839
FROM NURSES- HOW ARE YOU

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:13.374
DEALING WITH THE COST PRESSURES

01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:17.478
RELATED TO. THESE TYPES OF FEES

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:21.916
WITH SUCH HIGH OVERHEAD RATES.

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:24.385
CURRENTLY WEEK WE HAVE SEEN AN

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:27.155
INCREASE THAT IS EXPECTED WE DO

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:28.923
HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE WHERE

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.959
WE TREAT. ALL OF THE CASES THAT

01:30:32.026 --> 01:30:33.327
COME IN AND SEE IF THEY EVEN

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.363
NEED TO BE ELEVATED TO THE

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:39.634
EIGHTY LEVEL SO WE MAY- RIGHT

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.169
AND FINE WE MAY EVALUATE

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.905
INTERNALLY WITH AND- SPEAK WITH

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:45.706
THE DC DAYS. DEPARTMENT OF

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.308
INVESTIGATIONS DIVISIONS OF

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.576
INVESTIGATIONS SORRY ABOUT

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:54.448
THAT- AND THEN ONLY CASES THAT

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:55.383
HAVE TO GO TO AG GO TODAY. IN

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.317
AN INCREASE IN OUR FOR YOUR

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.653
DEGREE THE NUMBER REFERRALS TO

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:01.189
DOJ STAFF THAN TO TRY TO LIMIT

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:07.461
COST. AS LONG AS THE. WHAT IT

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:08.863
HOLD THE CASE BACK IF IT WAS

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:10.431
NOT APPROPRIATE CARE BRIDGET

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.034
THAT DO YOU DO SO WHAT DO YOU

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.569
THINK WILL BE I MEAN GIVEN YOU

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:16.003
LOOKED AT YOUR WORKLOAD WHAT DO

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.804
YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE THE

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:18.873
FINANCIAL IMPACT TO YOUR BOARDS

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.274
WHICH FAMILIES FINANCIALLY

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.442
DOING BETTER AND MANY OTHER

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.110
BOARDS BUT STILL. IT'S AN

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:25.813
IMPACT- WILL HAVE YOU DONE AN

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.183
ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE-

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.051
FINANCIAL IMPACT WOULD BE.

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:33.421
SQUARE IT WE DO GET- MONTHLY

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:34.589
STATEMENTS FROM OUR AG'S

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:38.626
OFFICE- OKAY SO. AS A YEAR AGO

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.228
WE DID RECEIVE THAT AND WE

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:42.196
CANNOT DO OUR PLEADINGS. AND

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.297
THAT WAS DUE TO AN

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:45.366
INTERPRETATION OF A LAW- AND

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.834
WHEN THAT LAW WAS APPROPRIATELY

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:49.370
INTERPRETED- THAT DIEGO DID

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:52.240
DECIDE THAT. THEY NEED TO SERVE

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:53.207
THE PLEADINGS AND THAT DID

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.109
CAUSE A- COSTINCREASE FOR US

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.245
AS WELL. OKAY SO I WOULD HOPE

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:59.347
AND AGAIN- I'M REALIZING BRING

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.915
UP HERE BUT I MEAN WITH EVERY

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.116
BOARD DAY WE SHOULD SHOULD

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.484
DOING SOME SORT PROJECTION

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:04.819
LOOKING AT YOUR WORKLOAD SAYING

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:06.587
WELL. WE GENERALLY NEED TO USE

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.256
AG STAFFER THAT'S- WHAT

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:10.958
EXACTLY. IS GOING TO BE TO

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.294
INCREASE COSTS- ANDI DO THINK

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.229
THAT. THIS BY MORE FOR US THAN

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:17.064
FOR USE THAT- WE REALLY DO NEED

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:18.332
TO DELVE INTO IT I THINK THOSE

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.167
OVERHEAD RATES ARE EXTREMELY.

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:22.236
EXCESSIVE AND- I'M NOT SURE

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:23.471
WHAT IT SHOULD BE BORNE BY

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:26.574
LICENSEES- AS WELL SO LET'S

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.976
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC- SO I

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.311
ALWAYS. I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.246
IN CONTINUING EDUCATION- HAVING

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:34.482
SERVED ON AND- THIS- COMMITTEE

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:35.983
FOR A WHILE. ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.518
THAT HAS COME UP WITH THE REST

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.753
OF BOARD REGISTERED NURSING

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.955

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:43.024
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS-

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:44.926
REGARDING TEACHING EDUCATION-

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.627
COUPLE LEVELS OF ONE IS THAT

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:47.595
YEAH I NOTICED IN THE WRITE UP

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.896

APPROVES CONTINUING EDUCATION

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.774
SO- THERE'S BEEN IN THE PAST

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.575
SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:03.077
SOME SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.412
COURSES THAT WERE APPROVED FOR

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:05.680
CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.214
DIDN'T SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:08.916
SCIENCE BASED A PRACTICE BASED.

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:10.751
AND SO HOW'S THAT BEING DEALT

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.153

ENSURE THAT- COURSES THEY'RE

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.461
BEING TAUGHT ARE ACTUALLY

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:21.529
CONTINUING EDUCATION AND

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.097
MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES FOR

SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE. WE DO

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:31.832

FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES

01:34:38.372 --> 01:34:39.774
IT'S A VERY LARGE NUMBER SO WE

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.943
DO. HAVE THAT AS ARTICLE. ONE

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.211
OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO

01:34:44.278 --> 01:34:47.481
IS ON OUR RENEWAL PROCESS WHEN

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.216
THEY ACCESS THE BREEZE SYSTEM.

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:52.319
EACH OUR END HAS TO. MAKE AN

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:54.321
ATTESTATION THAT THEY HAVE IN

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:56.390

ABOUT 8% I THINK STILL WRAPPING

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.451
THAT I. BUT WE HAVE MADE OUR

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:24.785
GOAL OF TEN PER YET BUT I THINK

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.988

DEFINITELY A SHOCK TO ME- I

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:37.364

01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:51.745
OFFICER AT THAT POINT- AND SO I

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:54.982

THIS HEARING- ON THIS

02:00:28.454 --> 02:00:30.690
PARTICULAR NURSES ISSUE.

02:00:30.756 --> 02:00:32.358
THERE'S A STATEMENT THE BEER IN

02:00:32.425 --> 02:00:34.193
PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED UTILIZING

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.795

APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:42.101
DOLLARS IN REVENUE. WOULD BE

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.836
LOST FROM CONTRACTING THE

02:00:43.903 --> 02:00:44.704
BUSINESS OF THE STATE TO A

02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.606
PRIVATE ENTITY THIS REVENUE

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:48.541
SUPPORTS OTHER AREAS WITHIN THE

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.046
PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S THE END OF

02:00:54.113 --> 02:00:55.481
THE QUOTE THAT THAT WOULD SORT

02:00:55.548 --> 02:00:56.949
OF SUGGESTS TO ME AT LEAST AT

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:59.251
SOME POINT IN TIME. THAT WE

02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:01.087
ELECTED TO USE A SLOWER PROCESS

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:02.989
IN ORDER TO GENERATE FEES FROM

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:05.224
LICENSEES TO RAISE REVENUE USED

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:07.059
FOR OTHER PURPOSES. I ASSUME

02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:09.462
THAT- TO THE IT TO THE EXTENT

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:12.098
THAT STATEMENT IS ACCURATEI

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:14.634
ASSUME THAT PREDATES YOU MA'AM.

02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.168
MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT PREDATES

02:01:16.235 --> 02:01:18.671
ME AS WELL- AGAIN I WANT TO

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:19.672
MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THE

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:20.706
PROCESS HERE I KNOW YOU'RE

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:22.441
TALKING ABOUT ENDORSING BUT YOU

02:01:22.508 --> 02:01:24.677
SAID ENDORSING OUT. AND SO

02:01:24.744 --> 02:01:26.946
ENDORSING TO THE BOARD OF

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:28.514
REGISTERED NURSING MEANS.

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:30.282
NURSES THAT ARE OUT OF STATE

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.718
THAT ARE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:34.220
AND I BELIEVE THE QUESTION I

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:35.321
JUST ANSWERED WAS ACTUALLY

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:37.523
ABOUT VERIFICATIONS AND THAT IS

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.825
WHERE LICENSE. ARE ENDS IN THE

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.761
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING

02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:44.497
TO GO OUT OF CALIFORNIA SO I

02:01:44.563 --> 02:01:45.965
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:48.100
COMPARING THAT THAT. CORRECT

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:50.336
TERMS WELL LIKE A KITTEN SO I

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:51.604
DID NOT PREPARE THE BACKGROUND

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:53.506
PAPER I CAN'T. ATTEST TO THAT

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:55.608
BUT IT RELATES TO THE ISSUE

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:56.175
HAVING TO DO WITH CALIFORNIA

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:58.377

PRACTICE OUT OF STATE.

02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:04.250
ENDORSING TO OTHER STATES

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:06.218
NURSING BOARD SO I DO THINK

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLES ARE

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:10.122

RELATIONSHIP OF THE BOARD

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:13.979
