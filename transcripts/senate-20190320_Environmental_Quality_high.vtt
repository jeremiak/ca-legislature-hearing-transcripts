GOOD MORNING SEVEN A MORNING

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.071
CHAIR ALAN AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.439
COMMITTEE HAD INCORRECTLY ON

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.807
BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:02.641
OF COMMERCE I WANT TO BEGIN BY

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:03.309
STATING.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.243
WE DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE A

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.445
PARTISAN ISSUE OUR BUSINESSES IN

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:07.546
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:09.949
SUPPORT SB ONES GOAL OF

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.717
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.219
ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR LAWS

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.654
AGAINST FEDERAL ROLL BACKS.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:18.891
WE HOWEVER DISAGREE WITH

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.259
STRUCTURED --

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:23.395
SPECIFICALLY SB --

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:25.831
ONE ALTHOUGH HAS A NOBLE INTENT

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:28.867
IT ROLLS BACK APA PROTECTIONS AS

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:30.402
TO HOW STATE AGENCIES PROMULGATE

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.704
RULE MAKING.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.173
IT CREATES AN AMBIGUOUS STANDARD

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.041
UNDER A LESS STRINGENT --

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:38.310
UNDEFINED TERM WHICH WE THINK

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.678
WILL INSTIGATE.

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:43.182
LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.784
UNCERTAINTY TO BE QUITE FRANK --

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:46.885
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.354
OPERATING UNDER THE CURRENT

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.989
EXISTING LEGAL REGIME FOR

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:52.491
DECADES AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.960
EXPECT TO OPERATE UNDER THAT --

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.795
BUT CALIFORNIA AGENCIES ALREADY

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.530
RETAIN EXISTING AUTHORITY TO DO

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.432
EXACTLY WHAT SB ONE IS TRYING TO

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:01.400
ACCOMPLISH.

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:02.601
IT'S WHY CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:03.869
ITSELF --

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:05.838
ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER BECAUSE WE

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.306
ALREADY HAVE ROBUST

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.641
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT EXCEED

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:10.676
FEDERAL STANDARDS IN ALMOST ALL

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.444
CASES WHERE THERE IS AN

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:14.380
INTERRELATIONSHIP OR A FABRIC

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:16.815
WOVEN BETWEEN FEDERAL AND AND

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:17.349
STATE LAW.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.518
WE THINK SB ONE COULD BE MUCH

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.619
MORE NARROWLY TARGETED TO

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.054
ACCOMPLISH --

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.188
THAT GAP BUT IN MOST

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.257
CIRCUMSTANCES A ROLL BACK AT THE

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.092
FEDERAL LEVEL WILL NOT IMPLICATE

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.260
STATE.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:30.129
ENVIRONMENTAL OR LABOR LAWS AND

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.430
WHERE IT DOES WE THINK IF YOU

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:34.366
WANT TO BE MUCH MORE NARROWLY

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.534
TAILORED TO ADDRESS THAT --

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.835
ALSO HIGHLY PRADA PROBLEMATIC

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.937
UNDER SB ONE IS THE FACT THAT IT

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:40.439
MANDATE STATE AGENCIES TO

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.875
PROMULGATE RULEMAKING WITHOUT --

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.144
ALE REVIEW OR A PA PROTECTIONS

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.979
INCLUDING A NOTICE AND PUBLIC

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.547
COMMENT.

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.782
THAT MEANS THE STATE AGENCIES

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.050
WILL BE DOING EMERGENCY RULE

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.552
MAKING WITH NO NOTICE TO ANY

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.054
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING NGOS

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.188
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:57.556
BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.257
AND THE ONLY REDRESS IF THE

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:02.161
AGENCY AT A POORLY WRITTEN RULE

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:04.296
IS THROUGH LITIGATION AND WE

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.098
THINK THAT WILL CAUSE --

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:07.566
EXCESSIVE COSTS TO THE STATE OF

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:09.234
CALIFORNIA WITH VERY LITTLE

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:09.868
ENVIRONMENTAL OR LABOR

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.470
PROTECTIONS --

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:12.871
FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND WHAT

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.306
MY COLLEAGUE WILL ADDRESS NEXT --

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:17.076
WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB ONE

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.311
FOR THOSE REASONS THANKS.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:19.978
ARE YOU PROPOSING AMENDMENTS OR

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.747
OR ITS AT A PERCENT UNLESS

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.382
AMENDED OR WE'VE BEEN WORKING

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:25.417
WITH -- THE

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.486
AUTHORS OFFICE TO MORE NARROWLY

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:29.588
CRAFT SB ONE IF THEY'RE OPEN TO

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.156
THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE UNLESS

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:32.725
AMENDED AT THIS TIME WE HAVE

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.259
ELEVATED TO A JOB KILLER

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.427
PRECISELY BECAUSE THE LACK OF

00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:36.462
DUE PROCESS AND OTHER

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:38.797
AMBIGUITIES IN SB --

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.432
ONE FRANKLY WE DO NOT BELIEVE

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.601
WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE GOAL

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.405
OF THE THE STATED INTENT OF THE

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:47.573
PROPONENTS THANKS.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.074
GOOD MORNING NO WELL KRAMER'S

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:49.608
THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.642
FEDERATION.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:51.877
I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:52.978
SAYING THAT OUR MEMBERS

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.580
APPRECIATE THE CLEAN AIR AND

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:55.614
CLEAN WATER --

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:57.149
AND ABUNDANT WILDLIFE HABITAT

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:58.717
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:16:58.784 --> 00:16:59.618
WE THINK THAT.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.954
MUCH OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.088
WORK THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE DONE

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:06.458
IN THE SECTION NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.360
THAT BEING SAID REASONABLE

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:09.928
PEOPLE CAN CERTAINLY DISAGREE

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.830
ABOUT THE BEST APPROACH TO

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.999
PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS AND WE

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.568
THINK THAT SB ONE IS NOT.

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:18.337
THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENSURE

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.638
THAT CALIFORNIA MAINTAINED ITS

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.240
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROTECTING

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.508
ITS ENVIRONMENT.

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:22.941
I WANT TO SPEAK MORE

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:26.412
SPECIFICALLY ALL OF INSTANCES.

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.380
I'M ON WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.115
CONCERNED WITH REMOVING THE

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.951
PUBLIC PROCESS --

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:34.553
FOR COMMENTING ON DEVELOPMENT OF

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.722
REGULATIONS SO SB ONE PROPOSES

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:37.623
THAT.

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.391
THE AGENCIES WOULD REVIEW

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.193
CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.196
PER PROPOSE A LIST OF ACTIONS

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.064
THAT THEY COULD TAKE TO MAKE

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.766
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BACKSLIDING.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:49.568
IT WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:51.069
COMMENT ON THAT LIST.

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.471
BUT THEN WHEN THE AGENCY MOVES

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:53.906
FORWARD AND ACTUALLY ADOPTS

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.308
REGULATION THE PUBLIC IS NOT IS

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.076
NO LONGER ALLOWED AN OPPORTUNITY

00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:58.744
TO COMMENT.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:17:59.912
I'LL GIVE A VERY SPECIFIC

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:02.014
EXAMPLE I'M AT THE AIR RESOURCES

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.248
BOARD RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN THE

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.784
PROCESS OF ADOPTING REGULATIONS

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.687
TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REPORTING

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.924
FOR PERMITTED ENTITIES ON AND

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.526
THE INITIAL PROPOSAL. FOR FOR

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.894
BUTTE COUNTY.

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:16.762
COUNTY HAS A PROBLEM

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.397
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.865
PERMITTED ENTITIES THEY

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.200
ESTIMATED THAT TEN OF THOSE AND

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.935
OF THOSE PERMITTED FACILITIES

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:23.802
WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS NEW

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.304
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.306
FARM BUREAU COMMENTED ON THAT --

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:29.141
THE AGENCY IS NOW IN THE PROCESS

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.642
OF MAKING CHANGES TO THAT THE

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.811
NEW PROPOSAL WOULD BRING IN

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.847
APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED OF

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.081
THE PERMITTED FACILITIES IN

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:37.382
BUTTE COUNTY.

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.485
SO UNDER SB ONE WE WOULD HAVE AN

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.053
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT JUST ON

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.087
THE FACT THAT.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:44.289
THEY ARE CONSIDERING ADOPTING

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.458
REGULATIONS TO REPORT WE WOULD

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:48.060
NEVER HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:49.795
COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.997
REQUIREMENTS AND WHO IS SUBJECT

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.098
TO THAT REPORTING.

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.900
SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.301
OF OURS --

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.637
ANOTHER PIECE IS I'M I KNOW THIS

00:18:58.704 --> 00:18:59.638
IS NOT OF THE COMMITTEE'S

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:01.206
JURISDICTION BUT THERE ARE

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:02.975
SIGNIFICANT.

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.776
QUESTIONS AS TO HOW OUR WATER

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:07.412
SYSTEM COULD BE MANAGED UNDER SB.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.615
ONE I'M SB ONE PURPORTS TO GIVE

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:10.816
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO THE

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.551
STATE TO CONTROL THE CENTRAL

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:13.886
OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:14.953
PROJECT.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.756
IT ALSO WOULD LIKELY THROW OUT

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:18.557
THIS --

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:19.992
RECENTLY NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.693
AGREEMENTS AND MAKE IT A

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.930
CHALLENGE TO ADOPT AND REVISE.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.265
UPDATED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.066
THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL OPINION TO

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.202
OPERATE THAT I'M.

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:31.169
CENTER VALLEY PROJECT IN THE

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.071
DELTA THAT IS RECENTLY BEING

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:34.439
REVISED.

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:34.973
SB ONE WOULD PREVENT THOSE

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.643
REVISIONS FROM.

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:39.444

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.414

THE PAST ACTIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.223
DECADES OLD WE WON'T BE ALLOWED

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.559
TO MAKE CHANGES FOR RISK OF

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.594
LITIGATION BECAUSE SOME FOLKS

MIGHT.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:58.063
VIEW THOSE CHANGES AS

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.197
BACKSLIDING.

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.667

THE PUBLIC INPUT REGULATIONS

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.397
RIGHT AND I'M WONDERING.

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:15.300
WHY WE NEED A FOR VISION TO IN

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.169
GENERAL RIGHT BECAUSE WE HVE

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:19.137
THE STATUS QUO THERE HAVE BEEN

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.272
REGULATIONS ISSUE THAT THE

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:21.640
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE BEEN

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:22.908
PUBLIC HEARINGS WE'RE NOT

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.976
CHANGING ANYTHING WE JUST HAVE

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.945
IT SO THIS SEEMS LIKE TWO BITES

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.213
AT THE APPLE IF YOU WILL?

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.183
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.851
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:33.819
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:35.220
THAT THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:36.521
ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THEY THERE

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:37.956
ARE REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW AT THE

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:38.990
FEDERAL LEVEL SO COULD YOU

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:42.861
COMMENT ON THAT. TO A START YEAH.

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:45.130
LET ME JUMP ON THAT BECAUSE I

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:45.731
YOU TOOK THE KEY YOU KNOWLEDGE

00:22:45.797 --> 00:22:47.265
AS BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE TO

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:49.735
BUY TO THE SAME APPLE --

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.970
I'M HUNGRY.

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:54.206
YES I SHOULD NOT ADDRESS --

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:56.575
YEAH I I THINK THE CONCERNS

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:58.310
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

00:22:58.376 --> 00:22:59.644
IN THIS SORT OF FEAR OF

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.747
LITIGATION IS MISS FOUNDED AT

00:23:01.813 --> 00:23:03.482
THIS POINT BECAUSE THE THE

00:23:03.548 --> 00:23:04.983
INTENT HERE IS JUST.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.752
IS PRESERVATION RIGHT SO IT'S

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:07.786
NOT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.554
ADDING ADDITIONAL REGULATORY

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.156
BURDENS ON TO INDUSTRY OR

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.191
ANYTHING IN ADDITION ANY KIND OF

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:15.293
NEW ADDITION OF AUTHORITY THAT

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.329
WOULD REQUIRE.

00:23:17.395 --> 00:23:18.797
ANY NOTICE AND COMMENT --

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.365
I MEAN SO --

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.167
POINT IS RIGHT THAT IN SOME WAYS

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.035
AS I SAID EARLIER THIS BILL IS

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:25.470
MORE ABOUT AN ORGANIZING

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:27.472
PRINCIPLE. FOR THE

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:29.141
ADMINISTRATION TO A THIRD TO

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:31.209
OPERATE UNDER FOR THE NEXT --

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:33.445
YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS HOPEFULLY

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.846
NOT NOT AS MANY ME HOPEFULLY

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.448
WON'T NEED THIS INSURANCE POLICY

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:38.450
THAT MUCH LONGER AND EVEN FOLKS

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:39.384
AND YOU KNOW CONGRESS COULD STEP

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:41.586
UP AND PUSHED BACK AND CHANGE

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:42.821
THEIR MIND BUT I THINK.

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.289
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT THIS IS

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:46.057
MERELY A PRESERVATION OF THE

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:48.059
STATUS QUO --

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:49.694
AND THAT'S THE END.

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.997
BUT I WOULD ADD A YOU KNOW WE'VE

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.331
WE'VE WORKED ON THIS LEGISLATION

00:23:53.398 --> 00:23:54.800
BEFORE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.001
TIME YOU'VE SEEN THIS.

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.736
ARE WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK

00:23:57.803 --> 00:23:59.471
BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE IT IS

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.673
NECESSARY WE HAVE BEEN WILLING

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.008
TO WORK WITH --

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:04.776
IN THE PAST YEAR ARE THE

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.678
ADMINISTRATION AND THAT WAS ONE

00:24:06.745 --> 00:24:07.779
OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:10.182
UP WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.385
HAVE ARE PUT INTO PLACE LESS

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:16.855
OF OF RULES AND THEN HAVE THINGS

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.490
CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT

00:24:18.557 --> 00:24:19.791
COULD CAUSE US HARM.

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:23.295
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:23.895
WILL NOT BE IN WILL ABLE TO

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.263
WEIGH IN.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.532
OUT WHEN DEPARTMENTS MAKE --

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:30.202
REGULATORY GUIDELINES DECISIONS

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:32.871
RULES WE CAN ADDRESS THAT MOVING

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:34.806
FORWARD THOSE WERE CONCERNS

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.341
BROUGHT UP BEFORE --

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:37.776
AND I'M MORE THAN WILLING I

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:39.211
THINK WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.479
TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THIS IS

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.148
THE FIRST OF FOUR HEARINGS --

00:24:43.215 --> 00:24:44.716
TO OTHER HEARINGS AND THE

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.518
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.220
IF THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.222
WHO ARE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:52.390
THIS WANT TO WORK ON THAT VERY

00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:54.893
ISSUE WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.061
TO IF WE ARE WORKING IN GOOD

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.429
FAITH TO WORK SOMETHING THAT

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:58.730
THAT --

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.365
CODIFIES AND PROTECTS OUR

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:02.667
EXISTING PROTECTIONS ON WORKERS

00:25:02.734 --> 00:25:04.502
CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER I

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:07.172
ENDANGERED SPECIES SO THAT WE

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.506
WOULD HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AS A

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:09.841
LEGISLATIVE BODY.

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:10.842
OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:13.345
ADMINISTRATIVE --

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:15.046
AGENCIES THAT CAN DO THAT

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:17.115
WITHOUT OUR INPUT SO IF YOU WANT

00:25:17.182 --> 00:25:18.183
TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.718
ABOUT THAT WE HAVE TIME TO WORK

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:20.619
ON THAT.

00:25:20.685 --> 00:25:21.820
I AND WE WOULD HAVE SIMILAR

00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:25.790
CONCERNS BUT I I THINK I SOME OF

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.292
THE COMMENTS ON THAT.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.494
I HAVE BEEN USED AS A SHIELD NOT

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.097
TO REALLY WORK WITH US --

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.165
TO TO ACTUALLY GET FURTHER AND

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:35.700
MAKE A SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:37.435
CAN AFFECTIVELY USE AND AT THE

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.304
SAME TIME CONTINUE TO MOVE

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.038
FORWARD.

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:42.140
ON REGULAR REGULATORY ISSUES

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:45.343
SCHEMES AND I HEARINGS THAT

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.047
FURTHER GOALS VALUES IN

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:52.417
CALIFORNIA THIS PARAGRAPH --

00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:53.685
ONE SAYS THE AGENCY MAY.

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.654
ADOPT STANDARDS SO THEY DON'T

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.923
HAVE TO TELL STANDS TO MEAN I'M

00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:59.324
SITTING HERE AND SAYING.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.426
THE THE SECRETARY OF THE EPA IS

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:02.661
THE SAME SECRETARY THAT WAS

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.396
REGION NINE TODAY AND THEY

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:06.498
PROMULGATED RULES AND REGION

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:07.933
NINE AND NATIONALLY ON THE EPA.

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.234
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT DANCE

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:10.502
AGAIN BUT THEN IT SAYS IN

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:12.904
PARAGRAPH TWO IF YOU DECIDE TO

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.539
ADOPT STANDARDS THEN YOU SHALL

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:15.573
THEY SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.008
EMERGENCY AND I THINK.

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.543

SECOND LEVEL THIS IDEA WHAT YOU

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.880
HAVE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS.

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:22.847
OBVIOUSLY THERE BRIDGES

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:23.882
REGULATIONS AND THEY SHOULD

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.016
HAPPEN RIGHT NOW RIGHT THAT'S

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.751
WHY YOU WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.287
IT GETS INTO THE THE THE PHOTO

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:31.756
DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT'S

00:26:31.823 --> 00:26:33.158
BEING -- BUT

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:36.528

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:39.097
FROM THE PRO TEM TO TO WORK THIS

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:40.832
THROUGH AND AND AND MAKE IT

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:41.132
FUNCTIONAL.

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:44.502
BUT IT'S A COPY AND PASTE JOB IS

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:46.538
CURRENTLY WHAT THE BILLS ALL IT

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:47.605
ST RIGHT YOU'RE NOT TALKING

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:50.075
ABOUT AN ENTIRELY NEW REGULATORY

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:50.709
FRAMEWORK THAT'S EMERGING OUT OF

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.710
NO WHERE.

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.511
THE MILITARY JUST PUTTING THE

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:55.580
SAME THING THAT'S ALREADY IN THE

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.716
C. C. R. --

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:58.717
IN YOU KNOW.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.218
THAT'S IN THE FEDERAL CODE

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.319
REGULATIONS INTO THE CALIFORNIA

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:02.554
CODE OF REGULATIONS LITERALLY

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.823
COPY PASTE THAT'S THAT'S WHY A

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.057
WORD WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:07.592
PROCEDURAL CONCERNS BUT IF THE

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:08.626
MECHANICS.

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.596
ARE THE ISSUE YEAH I THINK

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:14.132
THERE'S THERE'S OPENNESS SO

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:14.432
[inaudible]

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:16.601
THUNDERSTONE.

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:17.736
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.237
IT ADAM FROM THE CHAMBER IF I

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:22.807
COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION SIR --

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:23.975
BASED ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:25.143
THE BILL OF THE STATE AGENCIES

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.878
HAVE TO CONDUCT AN ECONOMIC

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.513
ANALYSIS OF THE EMERGENCY

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.716
REGULATIONS UNDER THIS BILL.

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:33.184
WELL CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT IT

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:34.319
COULD BE CONSIDERED MAJOR ROLE

00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:35.820
MAKING IF IT TRIGGERS A FIFTY

00:27:35.887 --> 00:27:38.390
MILLION DOLLAR OR MORE --

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:40.125
REGULATORY IMPACT ON THE RATE A

00:27:40.191 --> 00:27:40.992
COMMUNITY --

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:42.260
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ANALYSIS

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:44.529
BUT UNDER SB --

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:46.097
FORTY NINE WHICH IS BASICALLY

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:48.166
THE SAME BILL SB ONE IS --

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:50.735
THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

00:27:50.802 --> 00:27:51.836
THIS WOULD IMPACT AGENCIES AT A

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.138
LEVEL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:54.672
ANNUALLY WHEN AGENCY I THINK IT

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.674
WAS CAR WOULD BE ELEVEN MILLION

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.076
DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO DO THIS.

00:27:58.143 --> 00:28:00.478
POLITICIAN OF LIST AND PROBABLY

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:00.779
GET -- RULE

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:04.315
MAKING -- SO.

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:05.517
IT'S POSSIBLE WE HAVE AN

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:08.353
ACCIDENT THE CALCULATIONS BUT AT

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.387
ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.889
AGENCY IT'S SIGNIFICANT COST.

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.424
OKAY.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.425
MAYBE THAT PRETEND YOU MIGHT

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:15.026
ADDRESS AS WELL SENATOR THANK

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.395
YOU I IN IN LOOKING AT THE

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.364
FEDERAL RIGS THE ANALYSIS IS

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:20.365
ALREADY BEING CONDUCTED BY THE

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:21.800
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:24.269
I WHICH IS WHY THE BASELINE IS

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:26.171
SET SO THAT ANALYSIS IS ALREADY

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:30.008
BEEN CONDUCTED [inaudible]

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:32.944

FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:39.350
COMMENTS --

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:40.518
I THINK THIS WOULD BE YOUR

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:44.722
ATTENTION I WOULD HOPE THAT IN --

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:47.058
STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO ADDRESS

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.694
THE ISSUES HE RAISED ABOUT THE

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.862
WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.730
EMERGENCY BRAKES THAT WE DON'T

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:55.500
BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE.

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.969
EITHER WEAKENING THAT FOR

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:01.473
CAUSING IT --

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:05.043
TO DELAYING SINCE AS SENATOR

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.746
STERN POINTED OUT IN MOST CASES.

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:11.616
THIS IS GONNA BE A AT A ADOPTION

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.118
OF RAKES THAT WERE ALREADY

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.920
VETTED DOT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:16.988
DONE --

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:18.990
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ENGAGED IN

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.458
BECAUSE THEY WERE ADOPTED BY THE

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:22.327
FEDS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.428
REPLACE.

00:29:23.495 --> 00:29:24.863
THOSE THAT --

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:27.098
HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED DUE TO THIS

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:28.967
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SECTION.

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:35.006
NOW THAT SAID. TO ME THE

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:36.574
IMPORTANCE OF THE BILL IS MORE

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:37.842
THAN JUST THE FACT THAT THE

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:40.445
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS.

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:41.746
BACK PEDALED ON THESE VERY

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:43.882
IMPORTANT RAKES.

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.617
AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA PRIDES

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:46.151
ITSELF AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:48.286
LEADER.

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:48.887
WE HAVE TO DIRTY STEER IN THE

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.622
NATION.

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:53.658
WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:55.059
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NON

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.895
ATTAINMENT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.463
THE ABILITY TO GO FURTHER THAN

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.098
THE NATIONAL CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:02.901
WE HAVE PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHOSE

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:05.770
HEALTH IS IMPACTED AND ARE

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.005
SUFFERING DUE TO OUR THIRTY

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:08.806
ADDITIONALLY.

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:10.475
I THINK SOME OF US WELL SOME OF

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:13.244
US KNEW THAT WE HAD CALIFORNIA

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:15.947
RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE CLEAN --

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:18.183
HEALTHY DRINKING WATER I THINK

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.151
NONE OF US ADDITION SAY.

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:22.120
NINE MANY OF YOU MAY BUT I THINK

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.655
THAT FOR MANY OF US.

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.590
THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD A

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.559
MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.527
LITERALLY CANNOT DRINK THE WATER

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:31.095
OUT OF THEIR CAP.

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.731
WHEN WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:36.000
THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER?

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.869
THAT I WAS VERY PROUD THAT OUR

00:30:37.936 --> 00:30:40.505
NEW GOVERNOR HAS.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.839
DECIDED TO REALLY TAKE THAT ON

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:43.508
BECAUSE THOSE THAT'S JUST A

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:44.909
BASIC HUMAN RIGHT.

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.278
HAVING CLEAN ACCESS TO CLEAN

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:48.947
WATER AND NOT HAVING TO GO BUY

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.715
IT I MEAN CERTAINLY WE PAY OUR

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.684
WATER BILL BUT I MEAN NOT HAVING

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.117
TO GO.

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.419
AND GET IT IN A SEPARATE

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:55.353
CONTAINER.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.522
SO MY POINT IS THAT I WOULD HOPE

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:58.957
AND I THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS

00:30:59.023 --> 00:30:59.524
WRITTEN.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:02.527
IT ALLOWS AN AGENCY TO GO FOR IT

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.596
MAY NOT ALLOW THE AGENCY TO GO

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:05.763
FURTHER WITHOUT.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.665
SOME LEVEL OF PROCESS BUT

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.334
CERTAINLY IT IS ENCOURAGING OR

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.137
AGENCIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.406
HAVE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:17.942
RAKES TO CLEAN OUR AIR AND CLEAN

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:19.010
OUR WATER IN THE OTHER

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:20.745
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THAT.

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.413
YOU THAT ARTICULATED IN THE BILL

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.382
AS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.917
WORKERS ARE PROTECTED.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:28.519
SO WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING I

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.888
COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE BILL

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:31.189
[inaudible]

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.790
MINISTER.

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:35.360
THANK YOU --

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:36.894
THANK YOU GUYS BY I THINK

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.329
CONCEPTUALLY --

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:40.131
NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A REAL

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:42.133
HEART BURN ABOUT I GUESS MY

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.534
HEART BURNS OUT WHY DO WE NEED.

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.902
ARE HAVING SERVED AT LOCAL

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:46.638
GOVERNMENT FOR MANY YEARS WE

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.840
OFTEN A DOCTOR DOWN REGULATIONS

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:50.908
OR ORDINANCES THAT WE EXCEEDED

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:51.876
THE FATE STANDARD.

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.012
AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:57.615
WE HAVE THAT.

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:58.783
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.051
THE AUTHORITY HERE TO ADOPT A

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.619
AND CODIFY WHAT WE CURRENTLY

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:02.353
HAVE.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.822
THAT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A NEW

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.758
FEDERAL STANDARD THAT COULD BE --

00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.693
MINIMIZE DIMINISHED SO WHEN I

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:09.827
READ IT I THOUGHT WHY ARE WE

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.296
DOING THIS AND I THINK THAT'S

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.597
ONE OF THE CONCERNS.

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.265
ARE YEAH IN AS FAR REACHING

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:16.067
IMPLICATIONS REGARDING THE

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.902
PUBLIC PROCESS.

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:18.736
HE ADDED TO ALWAYS TROUBLES ME

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.038
WHEN WE TAKE POWER FROM THE

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.105
PEOPLE AND GIVE IT TO

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:22.974
BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE LEFT IN

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:23.608

IF NOT DIRECTLY THAT'S THE

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:27.779
IMPLICATION.

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:28.880
SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR AND I'M

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:31.215

STAKEHOLDERS WHEN I HEARD.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.754
THAT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THERE

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.924
MIGHT BE EARLY ATTEMPTS ISSUE

THAT ARE I THINK ARE VERY

00:32:58.976 --> 00:32:59.777

IN THAT WAY WERE PARTNERS THAT

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.919
WE SHOULD HAVE A STAND BEFORE

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.954
BUREAUCRACIES WHEN THESE THINGS

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:11.923

TROUBLING.

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.837
I TO ME JUST IN GENERAL AND

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:27.505
TAKING OFF A PARTISAN HAT. TO ME

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:29.674
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:32.276
STAND FIRST AND FOREMOST AS

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.378
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE

HERE.

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:36.481
AND THE FART STEW A QUESTION --

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.782
THAT TRANSPARENCY AND

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:39.650
ACCOUNTABILITY AND DOES START TO

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.252
SMELL TO PARTISAN FOR ME.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:43.688
SO PLEASE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:47.925
IN BUT NOT TODAY.

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:50.161
I APPRECIATE THAT --

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.463
ADVICE HERE I'M A COUPLE

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.401
THOUGHTS --

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.503
ONE TO THE PERSON FROM THE FARM

00:33:58.569 --> 00:33:59.637
BUREAU THAT SPOKE--

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.672
YEAH I WANT TO SAY IT THERE IS

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.174
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN SOME

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:05.510
CASES WE NEED TO CHANGE WE NEED

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:07.211
WE DO NEED A CHANGE IN STATE LAW.

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:08.679
TO SET THE BASELINE AND WITHOUT

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:10.415
THAT THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.883
ENSURE THOSE FEDERAL BASELINE

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:12.950
STAY IN PLACE.

00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:14.252
AND THEN EXAMPLE THAT I WAS

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.454
PROVIDED I FEDERAL FISH AND

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:17.789
WILDLIFE SERVICE'S PROPOSE

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.290
ROLLING BACK ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.958
THAT PROTECTIONS AND THOSE

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:22.393
PROTECTIONS GO AWAY.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.728
IF THEY DO STATE WOULD HAVE TO

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:26.431
GO TO FEDERAL COURT IN ORDER --

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:28.299
TO PROTECT THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE SO

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:29.700
WHILE THERE EIGHT ARE EXAMPLES

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.069
ON BOTH SIDES.

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:34.172
WHAT I WOULDSAY IS THIS --

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.840
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.408
IN THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AND

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:38.876
THE STATE PROTECTIONS.

00:34:38.943 --> 00:34:41.345
AFTER DECADES AND DECADES OF

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.181
THIS PROCESS IS VERY PROCESS

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:47.218
BEFORE US. TO SET THOSE GOALS

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.553
AND THOSE GUIDELINES IN THOSE

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:50.721
REGULATIONS IN SOME FORM OF

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:53.090
STATUTE OR REGULATIONS. TO MEET

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:54.592
THOSE VALUES IN THOSE GOALS.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:59.197
AND REGARDLESS OF PARTISAN

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.165
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AS TO

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.667
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IN EACH OF

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.302
THOSE AREAS THESE FIGHTS HAVE

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:06.170
BEEN DONE --

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.139
BUT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO WOULD

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.574
LIKE TO SEE ROLL BACKS.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.044
AND I IN THIS VERY STATE WE'VE

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.680
HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS --

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:18.249
SO FOR THAT REASON I THAT IS

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.051
BASICALLY THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.886
THIS LEGISLATION WHILE IT MAY

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:23.654
SEEM UNNECESSARY.

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.257
IN SOME CASES IT ISN'T AN ARE IN

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.494
TERMS OF YOUR COMMENT ABOUT --

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.062
YOU KNOW I WANT T LOSE OUR

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.964
AUTHORITY AS THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.599
BECAUSE IDON'T ALWAYS AGREE

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:36.334
WITH --

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.503
DECISIONS MADE WITHIN --

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:41.005
A DEPARTMENT OR AN AGENCY WILL

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.940
SAY BUREAUCRACY IF YOU WILL BUT

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.842
THE NATURE OF BUREAUCRACIES IT

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.377
IS REMOVED FROM THE PEOPLE WE

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:47.778
ARE NOT REMOVED FROM THE PEOPLE.

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.547
THEY HAVE HEARINGS IN WHICH THEY

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:50.982
CAN HEAR THE PEOPLE BUT WE ARE

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.283
THE CHECK AND BALANCE ON THAT

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.751
AND WE HAVE.

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:56.554
TO CONSTANTLY WORK IF YOU WILL --

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:58.322
TO ENSURE THAT THAT ACCESS IS

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.157
THERE WHEN I SAY GOOD FAITH

00:36:00.224 --> 00:36:03.227
EFFORT I MEAN IT --

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:05.329
I AM QUITE AWARE OF UNINTENDED

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.365
CONSEQUENCES OF THE GOOD THINGS

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.933
THAT WE TRY TO DO.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.001
THAT THE THE FOLKS THAT WERE

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.802
HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:12.737

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:17.708
TIME I'VE BEEN IN THE

00:36:17.775 --> 00:36:20.711
LEGISLATURE I LISTEN I HEAR AND

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:23.948
I ACTUALLY INCORPORATE A LOT OF

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:25.216
WHAT THEY SAY INTO.

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.817
A GOING FORWARD.

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.419
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS BI

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:29.954
PARTISAN ISSUES WITHIN THE

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.989
POLITICS AND IN THE POLICIES

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.324
THAT WE TAKE FORWARD.

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.359
MY MY REASON FOR BEING HERE IS

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:36.394
NOT.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.929
ART RELATED TO THE CURRENT

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:40.498

HEAR ME MENTIONING A NAME.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:45.236
THAT IS NOT MY GOAL MY GOAL IS

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:46.103
TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.505
PROTECTIONS AND THESE GOALS THAT

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:49.540
WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE WHICH IS

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:50.775
WHY I SIGNED ON TO THIS PIECE OF

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.610
LEGISLATION.

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:54.011
AND WANTED TO TAKE IT FORWARD.

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.047
HOT ALTHOUGH IT YOU KNOW IT

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.515
DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD LAST YEAR

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:59.483
FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDED

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.985
SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:02.587
SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:03.921
CONCERNED --

IF WE STRIVE TO MEET.

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.263
THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE A

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.732
CHANCE TO GET ACTUAL SUPPORT.

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:17.835
OUR NEUTRALITY I AS WE TRIED TO

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.236
ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT THAT

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:20.805
BASELINE SO --

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.873
MATTER BY SURE YOU HAVE MY WORD

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.409

THIS IS A SERIOUS INTENT NOT

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.481
JUST A A SHOW --

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:32.083
AND IN MY CLOTHES ARE I WILL

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.018
PROBABLY MAKE A PERSONAL COMMENT

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:37.822
AS TO WHY I'M DOING THIS BILL.

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.957
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:40.257

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:41.525
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:45.096
I'M.

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.530
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE POINTS

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:49.934
THAT WE WE SHOULD REMIND

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.502
OURSELVES ONE IS.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.004
THAT WE IS THE LEGISLATURE DO

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.605
YOU HAVE THE POWER TO OVERTURN

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:55.806
AGENCIES RAKES.

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:56.974
NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.909
INTRODUCING A BILL INTO STATUTE

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.679
BUT WE HAVE AS EVERYONE KNOWS

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.247
WE'VE ADJUSTED [inaudible]

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.882
VARIOUS --

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:08.552
RAKES OF AGENCIES OVER TOWN TIME.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:11.455
I THINK WE OBVIOUSLY.

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.190
IN TRIED TO DO THAT.

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.426
PRETTY JUDICIOUSLY BECAUSE WE

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:17.128
WANT TO RESPECT MANY OF OUR

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.263
STATUTES.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.732
BASICALLY GIVE GOALS TO AGENCIES

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.968
AND ASKING THEM TO DO THAT VERY

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:26.070
THOROUGH STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.406
VETTING PROCESS. TO DEVELOP THE

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.274
BEST ONES POSSIBLE AND THE OTHER

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:32.309
BENEFIT OF COURSE TO AGENCY

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:35.246
RAKES VERSUS OUR STATUTES IS.

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.914
AS MUCH AS I MEAN EITHER EITHER

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.683
PROCESS WHETHER IT'S AN AGENCY

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.217
RAKE OR STATUTE THEY CAN BE

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.385
CUMBERSOME.

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:43.754
BUT THE AGENCIES CAN SOMETIMES

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.423
OPERATE FASTER THAN WE CAN

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:47.792
BECAUSE WE ARE UNLESS OUR BILLS

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:48.492
ARE URGENT.

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.527
ARE --

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:51.228
PROCESS TAKES A FULL YEAR AND

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:53.230
THEN IT'S ANOTHER NUMBER OF

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.099
MONTHS BEFORE.

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.500
OUR STATUTES EVEN GO IN EFFECT

00:38:56.567 --> 00:39:00.571
AND THEN IF WE LONG IT TAKES US

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:02.807
TO HAVE TO COME BACK SO I THINK

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:05.843
THERE'S AS MUCH AS WE CAN BE

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.212
LEGITIMATELY AT TIMES CRITICAL.

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.848
OF AGENCY RAKES OUR PROCESS HAS

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:13.050
ITS PROS AND CONS BUT THE LAST

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:15.186
POINT I WANT TO MAKE IT IS.

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.821
WHEN WE REFER?

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:19.557
TO WARNING TO RESPECT THE PUBLIC.

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:24.095
I IN FOLLOWING THE THERE WERE

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:26.764
THE UNDOING.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.232
OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL RAKES THAT

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:30.768
HAVE BEEN UNDONE IN THE LAST

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:33.104
YEAR TO YEAR AND A HALF.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:35.506
I WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:38.709
CITATION OF ANY PUBLIC PROCESS.

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.611
THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE UNDOING

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:41.412
OF THOSE.

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:42.546
WHEREAS.

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:45.416
THERE WAS. EIGHT EIGHT VERY

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.218
EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.619
PROCESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.488
FOR SOME OF US.

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:53.557
IT FELT LIKE A RIDICULOUSLY LONG

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.259
FOR MANY OF THESE RAKES THAT

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.961
WERE QUICKLY THEN ON DONE.

00:39:57.027 --> 00:39:58.696
THE PROMULGATION OF THEM THEY'VE

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:01.499
THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOK.

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.768
MINIMUM FOR UP TO EIGHT YEARS

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:06.537
MANY OF THEM SO I I THINK IT'S

00:40:06.604 --> 00:40:08.072
VERY IMPORTANT TO PUTTHAT INTO

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.974
CONTEXT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.609
WHETHER WE'RE RESPECTING THE

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:15.880
PUBLIC OR NOT.

EXCEEDING THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.465
PLASTIC MATERIAL.

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.234
SO THAT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM IN

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.870
THE RECYCLE MARKET THAT WE'VE

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.405
DISCUSSED AS WELL.

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.139
UNLIKE NATURAL MATERIALS THAT

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:24.274
DECOMPOSE NEARLY EVERY PIECE OF

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.176
PLASTIC EVER PRODUCED STILL

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:27.978
EXISTS IN OUR LANDFILLS OR IN

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.246
THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NOT

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.847
GOING TO GO AWAY --

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.182
AS THESE ITEMS RAGMENT INTO

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:33.450
SMALLER PARTICLES KNOWN AS

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.251
MICHAEL PLASTICS THEY

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.286
CONCENTRATE TOXIC CHEMICALS AND

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.888
CONTAMINATE OUR FOOD AND

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.389
DRINKING WATER SOURCES AND THEN

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:40.724
THESE TOXINS ENDS UP.

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.993
INVOLVED WATER AND TABLE SALT

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.328
AND FISHING AGRICULTURAL SOILS.

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:46.296
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.531
THERE HAVE BEEN TOXINS

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.399
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLASTIC

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:51.335
THAT DO END UP BEING LINKED TO

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.569
CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.171
IMPAIRED IMMUNITY ENDOCRINE

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:54.638
DISRUPTION.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.974
OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.609
AND THE COST IS BEING BURNT BORN

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.077
RIGHT NOW JUST ON LITTER CLEAN

00:48:00.143 --> 00:48:02.045
UP ALONE BY OUR TAXPAYERS TALK%

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:02.679
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND HOW DO WE

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:03.547
MAKE THIS.

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:04.848
A COST EFFECTIVE THE FACT THE

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:07.184
MATTER IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:09.453
TAXPAYERS ARE STILL SPENDING

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:10.020
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.154
DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR OUR

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.456
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT HERE IN

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.624
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.792
I IN ANNUAL ONGOING EFFORTS TO

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:17.561
CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER IN

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.263
OUR STREETS AND OUR STORM DRAINS.

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.897
IN OUR PARKS IN OUR WATERWAYS SO

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:24.234
CLEAN UP A LOT OF MONEY RIGT

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:24.968
NOW.

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:27.337
AND UNFORTUNATELY IS AS WE HEARD

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:28.572
NOT ONLY IS THE CLEAN EXPENSIVE

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.407
BUT SIMPLY CAN'T KEEP PACE WITH

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.375
THE PRODUCTION.

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.143
OF SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE ITEMS.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:34.411
OR THE FACT THAT THE WAS ITEMS

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:35.846
ARE BREAKING DOWN INTO --

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:37.648
MICRO PLASTICS WHICH SIMPLY

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:40.050
CANNOT BE CLEANED UP BECAUSE

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:41.184
THERE TOO TWO SMALL.

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:42.519
LIST PRICE IS ONLY GETTING WORSE

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.487
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW CHINA

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.088
INDIA AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.189
COUNTRIES ARE NOW NO LONGER

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.624
TAKING OUR TRASH --

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:48.892
THERE NOW --

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.394
THAT'S NOW GETTING INCINERATED

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.129
OFTENTIMES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:53.830
AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DEPLORABLE

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:54.865

OR OR JUST NOT LANDFILL THERE

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.934
BUT JUST TOSSED OUT --

00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.537
INTO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THAT END

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:01.271
UP IN THE OCEAN.

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.739
AND IMPACTING AYE ANIMALS SUCH

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.408

ABILITY TO ADDRESS.

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:38.875
THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:39.776
EARLIER IN THE HEARING IN THIS

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:42.746
IS BASED ON THE SB THIRTEEN

WITH RECYCLING AND SO --

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.396
THESE ARE THE WE THINK THAT THIS

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:01.465
IS A A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.033
THAT WILL ADDRESS THE THE DIRE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:03.967

AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.311
MEASURE SENATOR CENTER STERN.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:14.778
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

MEMBERS.

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:16.847
I'LL BE BRIEF [inaudible]

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:21.451
IS THE A PERSONAL AND MORAL CASE

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:22.619
TO I THINK BE MADE ABOUT THE

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:25.222
NEED TO ACT BOLDLY THIS YEAR.

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.757
TERMS OF WHAT WORLD YOU WANT TO

LEAVE OUR KIDS.

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.159
AND HOW WE ACTUALLY WANTED

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.927
STUART OUR LAND AND WHO WE ARE

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.262
AS A PEOPLE.

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:34.931
AND THEN THERE'S THE MECHANICS

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.833
AND VERY BRIEFLY I AM EXCITED

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.068
ABOUT THIS MEASURE BECAUSE I

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:39.703
THINK THE DESIGN IS ELEGANT I

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.372
DON'T THINK IT'S OVERLY HANDS ON

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.040
AND PRESCRIPTIVE.

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:46.209
ABOUT MICROMANAGING A PROCESS OR

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.644
TRYING.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:48.879
TO DETERMINE WHAT OUTCOMES ARE

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.580
THAT INDUSTRIES GOING TO

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:53.016
INNOVATE AROUND I FRANKLY.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.551
INNOVATION RUN ANYTHING CRACKING

00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:56.453
IN FRACKING FIELDS IN OHIO RIVER

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.922
VALLEY IS NOT A EXCITING TO ME

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:01.491
AS NEW BUSINESSES POPPING UP ALL

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:02.993
OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.262
SO I THINK THIS SORT OF

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:08.298
FRAMEWORK THAT YOU USED.

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:09.599
TO FOR THIS REGULATORY AGENCY TO

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:12.102
AT LEAST WORK WITH SOME

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:14.404
FRAMEWORK AND NOT TRY TO DICTATE

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.006
TOO MUCH FROM THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.941
ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE --

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.343
IS A REALLY SMART DESIGN FOR THE

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.878
FUTURE AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:24.915
SEE JOBS BE CREATED OUT OF HIS

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:28.051
PROGRESS NOT LIMITED SO THANKS.

THANK YOU --

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:36.460

AT THIS PINT.

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:40.297
IN OUR STATES.

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:44.334
PROGRESS ON DEALING WITH WASTE.

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:46.303
AND IN THE WORLD'S.

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.205
I'M AS I REFERENCED EARLIER

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.273
DURING THE HEARING.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.275
I DO HAVE A BIT OF A LONG I'M

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:55.779
HISTORY ON THESE ISSUES AND I

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.314
WAS PART OF A GROUP OF EOPLE

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.882
THAT WROTE THE VERY FIRST 50%

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.717
WASTE REDUCTION.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.186
ORDINANCE IN US WHICH WAS PASSED

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:05.655
BY THE VOTERS A BERKELEY IN.

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:06.289
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WE DID

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:07.891
THAT.

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.360
BECAUSE STRONGLY ON THE BELIEF

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:12.496
THAT RECYCLING.

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:14.231
IN WASTE REDUCTION BUT MOSTLY

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.333
RECYCLING COULD HELP US GET OUT

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.803
OF OUR TRASH AND GARBAGE ISSUES.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.738
BUT AS TIME IS GOING ON WE HAVE

00:52:21.805 --> 00:52:23.907
REALIZED THAT WE IN WE HAVE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.442
INCREASINGLY.

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.710
DEPENDENT ON MORE AND MORE

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:29.179
PRODUCTS THAT ARE EITHER SINGLE

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.648
USE ONLY OR NOT RECYCLABLE.

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.617
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONFRONTED

00:52:33.683 --> 00:52:37.053
THAT ARE RECYCLING MARKETS HAVE

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.988
WE'VE ADDITIONALLY CONFRONTED

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.856
THAT.

00:52:39.923 --> 00:52:42.158
OUR PRODUCTION OF THE SINGLE USE

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:44.127
PRODUCTS IS HUGELY ENERGY

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:46.496
INTENSIVE SO THUS CONTRIBUTING

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.498
TO OUR CLIMATE CRISIS.

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:50.567
AND POLLUTION OF ALL SORTS

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:50.867
[inaudible]

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.569
I'M.

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:55.205
AND THAT OUR WHOLE RECYCLING

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:56.473
SYSTEM.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.542
WHILE INITIALLY CONCEIVED AS

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.343
SOMETHING THAT WAS WE COULD CALL

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.445
ENERGY NEUTRAL.

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:05.081
WAS DID NOT END UP BEING SO.

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:08.585
IN OTHER WORDS THE BENEFIT OF

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:09.486
COLLECTING MATERIAL IN

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:10.987
REMANUFACTURING IS IT YOU ARE

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:14.291
USING LESS ENERGY THAN MAKING

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.259
THAT THAT PRODUCT FROM A RAW

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:17.360
MATERIAL.

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:19.429
THAT STILL THE CASE. FOR A FEW

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:21.598
ITEMS BUT NOT MUCH NOW THERE IS

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.466
SO.

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:25.068
MUCH RESOURCES MEANING FOSSIL

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:28.071
FUEL ANOTHER INVOLVED IN OUR

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.973
WHOLE RECYCLING SYSTEM.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.876
OTHER THAN KEEPING WASTE OUT OF

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.511
PERHAPS OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:35.979
IT IS NOT GIVING US THE

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.314
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.182
THAT WE FIRST.

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.585
THAT OUR FIRST INTENTION WAS.

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.753
SO WE CANNOT RECYCLE OURSELVES

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:45.789
OUT OF THIS PROBLEM.

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.824
AND ESPECIALLY WE CANNOT RECYCLE

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.326
OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PROBLEM.

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:52.028
AS OUR USE OF MATERIALS THAT ARE

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:54.497
NOT RECYCLABLE ENTER SINGLE USE

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:55.565
ONLY KEEPS GROWING.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:57.467
NOW.

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:58.401
I MENTIONED THAT I WAS PART OF

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.103
THAT.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.571
GROUP THAT WROTE THAT FIRST

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:04.007
ORDINANCE WHICH WAS PASSED IN.

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.977
EIGHTY FOUR BY.

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:07.477
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.279
REALIZING THIS EVEN AS EARLY AS

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.881
THEN WE THEN WROTE A SECOND

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:14.050
VOTER INITIATIVE WHICH THIS.

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:15.452
ALAMEDA COUNTY VOTERS PASSED.

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:17.053
AND THAT INITIATIVE LED TO THE

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.755
CREATION OF STOP WE START WORK

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:19.856
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE NAME OF

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.691
THAT INITIATIVE WHICH VERY

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.393
RARELY GETS REFERENCED ANYMORE.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.229
THAT INITIATIVE WAS CALLED THE

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.331
SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:30.667
INITIATIVE AND WHAT IT CREATED

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:33.036
WAS A SOURCE REDUCTION AND

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.204
RECYCLING BOARD.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.073
SO STOP WASTE RENAMED ITSELF AND

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.441
THAT'S A GREAT NAME.

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.777
BUT ITS ORDINANCE NAME OR

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:42.912
INITIATIVE NAME WAS SOURCE

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:44.547
REDUCTION AND RECYCLING.

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:47.617
AND THE SOURCE REDUCTION PART

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.153
THE THING THAT NOT ONLY ALAMEDA

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.055
COUNTY BUT ALL OTHER WERE UNITED

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:54.557
STATES DOES NOT HAS NOT DONE TO

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:56.760
THE DEGREE THAT EUROPE JAPAN AND

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:57.594
OTHERS HAVE.

00:54:57.661 --> 00:54:59.629
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:03.166
NOW AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE A

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.834
JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL.

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.070
AND I HAD BEEN CONTEMPLATING

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:09.806
INTRODUCING A BILL BASED ON WHAT

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:12.342
THE CITY OF BERKLEY TRUSTED IN

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.744
RELATIONSHIP TO FAST FOOD

00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:16.546
PACKAGING AND SUCH BUT I THOUGHT

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.648
YOU KNOW JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.050
SENATOR STERN REFERENCED.

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.918
RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO GO

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.787
AFTER JUST THIS PRODUCT OR THAT

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:25.722
PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S A STYROFOAM

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:29.025
CUP WERE PLASTIC BAG.

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.360
WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:33.096
COMPREHENSIVELY WE NEED THAT

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.464
VERY --

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:37.233
HOLISTIC VIEW. TOO BECAUSE THE

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.601
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE FOR

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.503
EXAMPLE OF MY STAR FROM BEYOND

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:43.973
AS THE AUTHOR OF THAT WAS THAT.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.842
CLAIM SHELLS THE THE STAR FROM

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.944
CLEAR SHOWS WERE ELIMINATED BUT

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.512
CLEAR PLASTIC ONES CAME IN IN

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.814
PLACE.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.549
AND THEY WERE NOT RECYCLED AND

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:53.650
THEY WERE NOT --

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:55.685
COMPOSTED AND THEY WERE JUST IN

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:57.287
A WAY IS BAD.

00:55:57.353 --> 00:56:00.290
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HURT TO THE

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.992
ATMOSPHERIC OZONE LAYER BUT

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:05.562
ANYWAY SO WE SO THIS BILL IS

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.663
ELEGANT.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.865
IN THAT IT DOESN'T JUST TARGET A

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:11.067
SINGLE.

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:12.469
PRODUCT BUT RATHER LOOKS

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:15.004
COMPREHENSIVELY AT HOW WE CAN DO

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:17.140
THE SOURCE REDUCTION THAT NOW IS

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:19.242
OUR CHALLENGE IN WITH THAT.

CREATED.

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:47.156
AND FORTY NONE OF THESE EFFORTS

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.625

INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.031
WE CAN TRY TO UNLOCK THE SECRET

HIS WORK NOTED NO PRACTICAL

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.214
RESULTS.

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:12.548
THE SIMPLE FACT IS THERE'S JUST

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.083
TOO MUCH PLASTIC AND TOO MANY

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.585
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:16.319
BEING PRODUCED.

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:19.522

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:20.356
FOR THE MATERIAL.

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:23.259
WHICH MAKES REDUCE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.427
THE PIT TIPPING POINT FOR ME

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:25.828
PERSONALLY WAS WHEN SIXTY

WHICH IS ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:17.920
ACTUALLY ENDS UP IN THE OCEAN.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:19.589
HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:21.290

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:34.070
SO IT IS.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:35.104
THE FACT THAT MORE PLASTIC

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:37.139
PACKAGING NEEDS MORE TRACKS.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.608
DELIVERING OUR GOODS AND MARK

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.476

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.545
SOME STAGGERING STATISTICS 30% A

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.046
PLASTIC PRODUCE IS USED IN

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.915
PACKAGING AND THE MAJORITY IS

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.049
ONLY USE ONES.

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:48.884
LESS THAN 14% OF PLASTIC

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:51.687
PACKAGING IS RECYCLED GLOBALLY.

01:04:51.754 --> 01:04:52.989
SB FIFTY FOUR IS EXACTLY THE

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.457
KIND OF POLICY THAT GETS AT

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:55.424
ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:57.093
PROBLEM BY CREATING INCENTIVES

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:59.061
ARE INDUSTRY TO USE LESS PLASTIC

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.396
PACKAGING IN THEIR PRODUCTS.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.897
BY MAKING THIS PACKAGING FULLY

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.332
RECYCLABLE ENSURING THAT

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.101
RECYCLING HAPPENS IN CREATING A

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.636
CIRCULAR ECONOMY WHERE WE CAN

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:07.770
REPURPOSE DOES.

MATERIALS LOCALLY.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:12.041
AND CREATE THOSE JOBS LOCALLY.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.442
PLASTIC IS MATERIAL HOW CAN HAVE

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:14.810
A USEFUL USEFUL APPLICATION LIKE

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:15.811
AND HEALTH CARE.

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:17.647
IT IS A NECESSITY BUT THE

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:18.281
PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE USING IT

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:19.148
FOR EVERYTHING.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:20.249
CALIFORNIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:22.118
TO LEAD.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.619
ON FACING OUT PLASTICS THAT ARE

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.221
NOT REUSABLE RECYCLABLE ARE

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.255

FUELS THE TRANSPORTATION TO

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:35.498
DISPOSAL.

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:36.699
THEY ARE POLLUTING OUR AIR WATER

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.668
WILDLIFE AND PARKS BEACHES AND

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.236
THEIR OWN BODIES.

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.437
THIS WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE

01:05:41.504 --> 01:05:43.239
PLASTIC TRASH ACOSTA MANAGING

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:44.106
AND BUT IT WOULD CREATE JOBS

OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WE'RE NOT

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:21.283
OPPOSED. TO WHAT IS TRYING TO

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.918
ACHIEVE I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:25.387
ON THAT WE WE APPRECIATE THE

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:27.055
APPROACH TO THIS BILL IS TAKING

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:29.291
IN TERMS OF A YEAR SETTING A

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:30.659
RECYCLING.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:31.860
GOAL.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.629
AND REQUIREMENTS AND HAVING

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.297
INDUSTRY ACHIEVE THAT WE'VE SET

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.331
OUR OWN RECYCLING GOALS.

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:37.866
ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR THAT HUNTER

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.134
PERCENT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING THE

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.103

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.371
THIRTY SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.239
OPPOSED TO THIS.

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:46.041
WHAT WHAT THE BILL'S TRYING TO

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:47.042
ACHIEVE -- I

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.177
DO WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:50.812
WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.148
AND CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE BILL

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.950
AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND HOW IT

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.019
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED --

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:58.787
THE SCOPE OF THE BILL

01:15:58.854 --> 01:15:59.087
[inaudible]

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.023
IS UNCLEAR.

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:02.691
THERE'S TERMS THAT ARE USED THAT

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:03.392
WE DON'T THINK ARE

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.693
INTERCHANGEABLE BUT THEY'RE USED

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.662
THROUGHOUT THE THE BILL SINGLE

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:07.596
USE PACKAGING.

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:09.798
THING USE PRODUCTS SINGLE USE

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:10.933
CONSUMER GOODS.

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.100
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.002
NEED TO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS AS

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.437
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:18.373
IT IS UNCLEAR OF THE UNIVERSE

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:18.640
THAT WERE.

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.242
WERE WERE LOOKING AT THE BILL

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:22.277
DOES GRANT UNFETTERED AUTHORITY

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.612
TO CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.281
IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:27.749
IT'S SPECIFICALLY STOCKS ABOUT

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.117
ANY OTHER REGULATIONS AND

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.619
POLICIES AND DEPARTMENT DEEMS

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.220
NECESSARY.

01:16:32.287 --> 01:16:34.556
THAT'S PRETTY OPEN ENDED --

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.224
IT'S A HUGE DELEGATION OF THE

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.926
LEGISLATURE'S AND ARGUE OVER

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.761
SIDE OF OF OF THIS ISSUE TO CAL

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:40.963
RECYCLE.

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.030
AND SO WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:44.232
SOME CLEAR GUIDELINES AND AN

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:45.500
OVERSIGHT.

01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:46.835
BY THIS BODY AS THIS BILL MOVES

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:49.571
FORWARD.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.940
IN TERMS OF THE THE TIME LINES A

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.175
WE THINK PRACTICAL TIMELINES ARE

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.409
NEEDED.

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:55.911
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK YOU CAN

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:58.013
ACHIEVE A SCOPING PLAN OUT OF

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.816
POWER CYCLE IN A ONE YEAR PERIOD.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:01.550
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:03.719
DEVELOP.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.854
INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.055
MARKETS FOR SOME OF THIS

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.690
MATERIAL SO I THINK AS THIS AS

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:09.391
WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.093
THINK WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.461
CERTAINLY WORK ON THAT BUT I

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:13.762
THINK AS IT AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED.

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.030
IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:17.132
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PRACTICAL TO

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.534
ACHIEVE SO THAT WAS ANOTHER

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.102
ISSUE THAT I WOULD WANT ONE

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.104
HIGHLIGHT --

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:22.637
A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SOURCE

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:24.072
REDUCTION.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.708
AGING SERVE A LOT OF PURPOSES IT

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:28.143
HELPS ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS ARE

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.479
DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER --

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.447
IN A FASHION THAT THE THAT THAT

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.782
IT'S SAFE IT'S EFFICIENT.

01:17:33.849 --> 01:17:34.783
THE PRODUCT GETS THERE IS NOT

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:40.222
BROKEN THE ELIMINATING PACKAGING.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.556
I THINK MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE.

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:44.893
TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.527
SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE I THINK

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:45.994
WE HAVE.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.763
TO CONSIDER AS AS AS AS AS

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:48.730
DISCUSSION --

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:51.933
CONTINUES --

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.069
THERE IS ALL ON THE BOOKS.

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.604
A LAW LIKE OUR CYCLE HAS BEEN

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.406
IMPLEMENTING SINCE THE EARLY

01:17:57.472 --> 01:17:58.140
NINETIES.

01:17:58.206 --> 01:17:59.674
THAT GOVERNS PLASTIC CONTAINERS

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.309
OF EIGHT OUNCES OF FIVE GALLONS

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:02.644
REQUIRING THEM TO CONTAIN A

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.012
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:07.682
MATERIAL OR BE SOURCE PRODUCED --

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:08.950
A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.685
COMPLYING WITH THAT LAW HAD BEEN

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:11.520
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF

01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:13.055
MATERIAL RECYCLE MATERIAL THAT

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:13.989
THEY'RE USING IN THE PRODUCTION

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.857
OF THEIR PRODUCTS.

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.225
WE'RE NOT CLEAR HOW THIS BILL

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.727
WOULD INTERSECT WITH THAT

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:19.694
PROGRAM.

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:22.364
ALSO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT --

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.032
I THINK.

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:25.333
DESERVE SOME ATTENTION --

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.601
AND AND CONVERSATION HAD TRY TO

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:29.037
FIGURE THAT OUT.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:29.671
FIND SOMETHING I'LL MENTION IS

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:31.173
THAT -- YOU

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:33.508
KNOW WE WERE.

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.677
WE ARE COMMITTED.

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.379
THE GETTING TO THESE THRESHOLD

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.713
THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.048
THE BILL.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.316

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.848
INSTEAD GO AFTER THIS SOURCE OF

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.716
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT MAY

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.451
HAVE COMPLETELY NOT FACTORED THE

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:26.287
FACT THAT WHAT WE NOW KNOW.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:29.090
THAT OUR BLACK CARBON

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:29.390
[inaudible]

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:30.592
IS.

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:32.160
IT IS S. SUCH A SIGNIFICANT

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.995
GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTER.

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:36.531
WHICH NOW THE AGENCY OF COURSE

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:39.033
IS REGULATING SO.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.835
I THINK WHAT ARE.

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.103
WHEN I WAS SAYING THE WORD

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.438
ELEGANT IT REALLY WAS WHAT I

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:45.373
MEANT IS THAT IT'S RATHER THAN

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.076
US TRYING TO PREDETERMINE?

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:49.677
WHAT THE SPECIFIC RIGHT

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.546
APPROACHES WHEN WE HAPPEN

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.647
FACTORED THE UNINTENDED

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:54.415
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT SPECIFIC

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:55.984
RATE APPROACH OR WHETHER THE

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.353
MARKETS EXIST OR WHETHER THERE'S

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:59.521
FACILITY THAT CAN RE

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.689
MANUFACTURED THAT MATERIAL?

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:04.092
THAT'S REALLY RECYCLING CLOSING

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.293
THE LOOP.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.462
WOULD BE A MISTAKE AND SO THE

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:08.963
EIGHT IT'S GIVING THE ABILITY

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.532
FOR THE AGENCY TO DO THAT WHO

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.333
HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.801
STATE OF THE MARKETS THE LOOK AT

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:14.736
THE STATE OF PRODUCTION

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.404
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA --

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:17.772
THE U. S. THE STATE OF THE

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.375
MATERIALS IN ALL OF THE REST OF

01:26:20.441 --> 01:26:20.542
IT.

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.277
BUT SHE ALSO JUST TALKING BOUT

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:23.311
LEAKAGE BECAUSE IF YOU BàN

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.013
SOMETHING HE COULD HAVE TO

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:25.613
CREATE SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.550
IT'S SORT OF LIKE --

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:29.183
CENTER HILL IN THE CUP RIGHT YOU

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:32.220
KNOW BASELINE PROVISIONS AN

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:34.022
IMPORTANT ONE TO UNDERSTAND IS

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:35.557
HOW TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:36.724
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.793
AMENDMENTS THAT --

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.295
WERE WERE ADDED --

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:42.564
IN THE MOST RECENT ROUND ABOUT

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.299
DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS TRULY

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.800
SINGLE USE BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:46.834
SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE DON'T

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:48.102
EVEN KNOW IT CAN BE USED.

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.504
ONCE OR TWICE RIGHT I MEAN

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:50.872
THAT'S INVOLVING AND THE ONES IN

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:53.308
THE TO SLIDE YOU SOMETIME AND

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:56.477
AND THE LABELING IS TRICKY SO.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.746
IT'S TO TO ACTUALLY SCOPE THAT

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.381
AND GET A BASELINE OF WHAT THE

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:02.450
SCOPE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC SO

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:04.252
ARE IN THE STATE IN THAT

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.954
DEFINITION PROCESS I THINK IS

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.289
CENTERS THAT IS PURPOSELY --

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:10.925
SORT OF DEFERENTIAL IN SOME WAYS

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:13.027
TO THE PROCESS AND WE'RE OPEN

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:13.661
ONCE YOU GET A SENSE THAT BASS

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.296
LINE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.864
HIT A 20% TARGET IN A IN A

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:19.067
REASONABLE FASHION AS YOU'RE

01:27:19.133 --> 01:27:21.202
MENTIONING BUT IT'S HARD.

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:21.836
TO APPROACH CENTER YOU KNOW THE

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:22.370
SCOPE OF THE I THINK THE

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:24.005
INVENTORY AND THEN YOU AND YOU

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.273
KNOW IN WITH THIS THAT WE DID

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.908
WITH CLIMATE RIGHT YOU START

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:27.609
WITH A GREENHOUSE GAS HIM TOWARD.

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.477
INS IN FULL SCOPE AND THEN YOU

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:30.044
CAN ACTUALLY ABOUT ME I'M

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.379
CURRENTLY OPTIMISTIC I KNOW

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.314
GOVERNOR BROWN SPENT THREE YEARS

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.916
MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:37.986
RECYCLING ISSUE SO WHY NOT LET'S

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.988
GET DONE IN A YEAR ESSENTIALLY

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:40.922
THIS WRITTEN A WELL NO BUT WITH.

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:47.495
THE THE 20% RATED BY.

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:48.496
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN IN A

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:49.530
KIND OF GOES UP FROM THERE SO SO

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:51.232
NOT NOT WHEN YOU'RE BUT BUT BUT

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:52.200
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS THIS IS

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:53.134
ABOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.202
WE CAME UP BEFORE THAT THAT THAT

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:55.536
CENTER HERE ALLUDED TO THAT.

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:56.371
A LOT OF THINGS SAY RECYCLABLE

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:57.338
AND I THINK JERRY HELL WAS

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:57.905
LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT --

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:58.473
BUT THE QUESTION IS EASY TO

01:27:58.539 --> 01:27:59.841
ACTUALLY BEING COLLECTED AND IS

01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:01.042
IT BEING TURNED INTO ANOTHER

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.143
PRODUCT THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.379
RECYCLING RATE MEANS MAKING SURE

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:05.880
THAT WE ACTUALLY.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.215
ARE YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY GIVE

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:09.017
REAL TANGIBLE MEANING TO THE

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.518
LABELING ON THESE PRODUCTS.

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:11.653
IT IT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT NOT

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.621
WHETHER IT IS IT RECYCLABLE BUT

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:15.223
IS IT ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:17.792
AND TURNED INTO A INTO INTO A

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:20.762
USABLE PRODUCT.

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:23.097
CENTER BATES GET OUT HERE.

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:26.901
THANK YOU OF SENATOR WITH COFFEE

AT A BUNCH OF OTHER MEETINGS

01:28:29.237 --> 01:28:30.571
LATE ANYWAY --

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.040
I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.741
FIRST THAT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

01:28:33.808 --> 01:28:34.475
HERE -- IN

01:28:34.542 --> 01:28:36.944
THE ISSUE IS INDISPUTABLE ARE

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.212
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:39.614
WITH THE PLASTIC POLLUTION

01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:40.682
INDISPUTABLE.

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:42.216
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU PRESENTED

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:44.886
HERE HAVE A DISPUTED BOWL.

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:47.221
COMPONENT TO IT AND I THINK THE

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:50.558
FIRST I THINK IT'S TROUBLING AND

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.726
WILL BE TROUBLING TO OUR

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:54.028
CONSTITUENCY IS A DEFINITION OF

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.463
SINGLE USE BECAUSE WE HAVE TOYS

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:56.831
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NEW

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.999
FATHER.

AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW HOW

01:28:59.000 --> 01:28:59.634
MUCH -- YOU

NEW ROOM FULL OF STUFF AND A LOT

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:06.274
OF ITS PLASTIC IN IT IT IS

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:07.008
THOUGHT.

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.043
IT IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH IF A

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:11.479
PRODUCT RATHER THAN A PACKAGING

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:12.580
HERE SO I THINK THAT THE FOCUS

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:14.315
THAT WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:16.150
TERMS OF WE GOING FORWARD IS TO

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:18.152
BE FOCUSING ON IS THAT A PRODUCT

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:20.021
AND THIS WAS A DIRECTIVE TO CAL

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.289
RECYCLE BASICALLY.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.690
I IS THAT A PRODUCT OR IS THE

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.125
PACKAGING ABOUT.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.426
I THINK RECYCLE --

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:27.261
CAL RECYCLE NEEDS TO PROVIDE

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.297
SOME TESTIMONY HERE IN TERMS OF

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:31.032
HOW THEY WILL DEAL WITH THIS NEW

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.400
ASSIGNMENT THEY HAVE MANY OF YOU

KNOW.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.369
WE HAVE THE WILDFIRE ISSUE AND

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:36.704
HOW RECYCLING ALL THAT OUT SO

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:37.638

MILLION MORE DOLLARS --

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.852

BE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT AND

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:06.134
PERHAPS THAT REQUIRES PHASING.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:10.204
OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:12.974

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.152
PRODUCTS THAT.

NEED TO BE STERILE WHEN THEY'RE

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:40.788
WHEN THE DAY THAT THE

BENEFICIARIES NAMELY THE

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:42.890

MY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY ACTUALLY

PUTS TOGETHER --

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.298
PRODUCTS.

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:53.100
OF THAT HER KIDS THAT ARE USED

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.368
FOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES OF THE

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:56.470
THE PACKAGING IS VERY VERY

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:58.172
UNIQUE -- I

01:32:58.239 --> 01:32:58.940
HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M VERY

01:32:59.006 --> 01:33:00.608
CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING US SO

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:03.844
MUCH AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE --

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:04.879
TO DETERMINE THAT THE

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.180
REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.449
NEEDED AND I'M HOPING THAT --

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:11.052
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE SOME.

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:13.421
OVERSIGHT AND CODIFICATION AND

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:15.089
ECONOMIC STUDIES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:16.424
SOME OF THOSE.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:19.393
THOSE REGULATIONS AND CERTAINLY

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:24.298
COULD COST TO THAT AGENCY THAT --

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.032
IS IT.

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.268
AT HAS DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:29.704
CHALLENGES IN THE PAST --

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:30.972
I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:33.474
SCOPING PERIOD A TIME OF YEAR --

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.376
I THINK EVEN THE AUTHORS BY THE

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:35.977
WAY THEY WERE KIND OF SHAKING

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.378
THEIR HEAD --

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.547
REALIZE THAT THAT A YEAR IS AN

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.816
AWFULLY OVERZEALOUS --

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.684
PERIOD A TIME WHEN YOU CONSIDER

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.086
HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE AB

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:47.221
THIRTY TWO SCOPING TO COME ABOUT

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:48.789
THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AS

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.525
COMPREHENSIVE --

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:53.961
AS AS THAT --

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.062
SO -- THE

01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.831
LAST THING I WANT TO SUGGEST IS

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.666
THAT -- THE

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:00.534
STAKEHOLDERS WE DON'T REALLY

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:02.837
NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE.

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:03.404
AND I REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.872
YOUR BILL --

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:06.073
BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.575
THAT THE THE STAKEHOLDERS OF

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.710
REPRESENT SOME VERY IMPORTANT

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:11.012
PRODUCTS --

01:34:11.078 --> 01:34:13.414
REPRESENT A LOT OF MANUFACTURING

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.548
JOBS -- IN

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:17.385
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:20.988
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE --

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:23.257
PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS --

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.458
WITHOUT HAVING THEM HAVING THE

01:34:24.525 --> 01:34:26.227
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:28.029
SHARE THEIR CONCERNS AND AND

01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:29.397
MAYBE EXTEND SOMETIME LINE SO

01:34:29.463 --> 01:34:31.565
THAT THEY CAN IN FACT --

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:32.700
TAKE SOME OF THE SINGLE USE.

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:35.036
ITEMS THAT ARE NOT RECYCLABLE AT

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:37.905
THIS TIME AND MAYBE FIND WAYS TO

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:39.440
RECYCLE THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.808
EMBARGO --

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.176

THE STAKEHOLDERS HOPEFULLY BY

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:50.184
BECOMING MORE INVOLVED AND BEING

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.652
PART OF THE SOLUTION.

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.721
AND I LIKE MY COLLEAGUE WHAT

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:54.588
WILL LAY OFF AT THIS POINT IN

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.856
TIME -- AND

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:57.191
I HOPE TO SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:34:57.258 --> 01:34:58.459

FORWARD.

02:00:09.869 --> 02:00:12.238
ESTABLISHING THE FUNDING

ARCHITECTURE FEW WILL IN IT WILL

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:18.744

YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:38.664
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET OVER WHAT

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:40.533
THE COST WAS THE BILL LAST YEAR

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.167
I THINK WAS LESS THAN A HUNDRED

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:44.103
MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:00:44.170 --> 02:00:44.704

MY MY CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.748
THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.683

02:00:57.750 --> 02:01:00.386

A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MY

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:03.789

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:08.327
NEAR POVERTY LEVELS AND WHAT

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.762
WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT --

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:10.363
COMING CLEAN MORE MONEY EXXON

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:11.897
AGAIN THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.299
NOT WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY.

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:14.533
BUT THE MODEL THAT THE

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:15.701
GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:18.337

OF OF WATER DISTRICTS AND THEN

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:58.297
WE HAVE SINGLE WELL OWNERS AT

02:03:58.364 --> 02:03:59.632
CENTRAL BUT ALL DEFERRED TO

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.100
COUNSEL ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE WE

02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:02.601
HAVE OTHER MECHANISMS.

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:04.603
THAT FORCED THE GATE WE GAVE THE

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:05.771
POWER TO STATE WATER RESOURCE

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:07.239
BOARD WE'RE FUNDING --

02:04:07.306 --> 02:04:08.874
WE CONTINUE THE FUN THEM TO FOR

02:04:08.941 --> 02:04:11.911
SOME OF THESE FEELING WATER

02:04:11.977 --> 02:04:13.312
SYSTEMS.

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:13.979
YOU FOR MYSTICALLY COME TO JESUS

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.781
AND SAY YOU WILL CONSOLIDATE WE

02:04:15.848 --> 02:04:17.750
WILL FORCE YOU TO DO THAT BUT

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:19.251
THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM.

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:20.653
WELL DIFFERENT PROGRAM SO YEAH I

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:23.789
WANT TO SEE IF WE DON'T HAVE

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:25.925
AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:27.626
I WAS AT WORK.

02:04:27.693 --> 02:04:29.261
SO I I I THINK THAT'S A REALLY

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:30.896
GOOD QUESTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT --

02:04:30.963 --> 02:04:32.031
PRIVATE WELLS ARE IN A DIFFERENT

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:32.998
POSITION THAN.

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:35.801
I COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS.

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.436
SB EIGHTY EIGHT THAT FORTY THAT

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:39.004
YOU REFERRED --

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:40.673
ALLOWS THE STATE TO ORDER

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:42.107
CONSOLIDATION OF BAILING WATER

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:43.175
SYSTEMS.

02:04:43.242 --> 02:04:45.110
I'LL LAST YEAR AB TWENTY FIVE A

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:48.581
ONE X. TO ORDER EXTENSION OF

02:04:48.647 --> 02:04:50.216
SERVICE TO PRIVATE WELLS.

02:04:50.282 --> 02:04:50.850
SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:52.551
ANSWER THERE ARE COMMUNITIES

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:54.253
LIKE TOMBSTONE --

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.188
TERRITORY IN FRESNO COUNTY.

02:04:56.255 --> 02:04:57.656
WHERE THERE'S A LARGE CLUSTER OF

02:04:57.723 --> 02:04:59.225
PRIVATE WELLS WERE EXTENSION OF

02:04:59.291 --> 02:05:00.693
SERVICE IS PROBABLY THE BEST

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.995
ANSWER THEIR?

02:05:03.062 --> 02:05:03.629
QUITE A BIT OF CONTAMINATION IN

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:04.830
THAT COMMUNITY.

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.565
THE OTHER PART OF THE ANSWER I

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:07.533
THINK I THAT SOME OF IT'S GOING

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.835
TO HAVE TO BE CONTRACTED OUT

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:12.238
THROUGH SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE.

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:14.106
ENTERPRISES ARE CA SEE IN ORDER

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.941
TO DO.

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:18.177
TREATMENT ONE OF USE TREATMENT --

02:05:18.244 --> 02:05:20.446
TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES.

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:21.046
AND IF I MIGHT JUST ADD ON TO

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:22.348
THAT.

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:24.149
THE CONSOLIDATION PIECE THIS

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:26.318
BILL DOES NOT.

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.254
PREVENT IN FACT MAIN DEED

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.421
PRIORITIZE.

02:05:29.488 --> 02:05:31.957
SOME CONSOLIDATION.

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.759
SOMETHING A LITTLE UNDER HALF OF

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.327
THE THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICT

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:37.529
IDENTIFIED WE THINK WOULD BE.

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.698
CANDIDATES FOR CONSIDERING

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:40.833
CONSOLIDATION.

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:42.534
WITH A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:44.203
SOURCE AND THAT COULD BE THE

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:46.939
BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR THOSE

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:48.841
COMMUNITIES IN DISTRICTS.

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:51.377
SO WERE WE DON'T PRECLUDE THE

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:53.612
PROSPECT OF CONSOLIDATION.

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:57.182
AS PART OF THE OVERALL REMEDY.

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:57.917
AND I GUESS THOUGH THE LAST

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.551
QUESTIONS WE HAVE YOU KNOW

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.719
NITRATES ONE SOURCE OF POLLUTION

02:06:00.786 --> 02:06:02.655
WE GOT NATURALLY OCCURRING

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:03.923
ARSENIC THAT'S ANOTHER SOURCE.

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.557
OF POLLUTION YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:07.660
SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HOW WOULD

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:09.528
I SAY THIS HAVE LOCATED IN THE

02:06:09.595 --> 02:06:11.530
ABSOLUTE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:12.331
THAT THEY COULD BE.

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:14.233

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:21.947
C. ADMINISTRATIVELY.

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:23.949
CHOSE TO APPLY THE ACT TO GLASS

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:26.618
CONTAINERS. FOR REASONS NOT WELL

02:10:26.685 --> 02:10:29.621
UNDERSTOOD EVEN TO THIS DAY.

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:30.722
GLASS BOTTLES CONTAIN TRACE

02:10:30.789 --> 02:10:32.491
AMOUNTS OF LEAD.

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:34.259
SINCE CALL IT WHICH IS SOURCE

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:35.727
FOR MANY TYPES OF GLASS PRODUCTS

02:10:35.794 --> 02:10:37.196
THE COME FROM MANY COUNTRIES

02:10:37.262 --> 02:10:38.797
AROUND THE WORLD.

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:41.700
IS CONSTANTLY RECYCLE. TO ME THE

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:42.234
HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.570
STANDARD GLASS MANY FACTORS

02:10:44.636 --> 02:10:45.204
BAXTER'S.

02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:46.638
MUST REDUCE THE PERCENTAGE OF

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:47.906
RECYCLED CULLEN THE GLASS

02:10:47.973 --> 02:10:51.043
MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.911
THE LESS COLOR USED IN THE GLASS

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:54.379
MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

02:10:54.446 --> 02:10:56.782
MEANS MORE GLAD VIEWS GLASS WILL

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.684
STAY IN THE WASTE STREAM AND

02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:59.751
WE'LL BE LANDFILL.

02:10:59.818 --> 02:11:01.353
THIS IS CONTRARY TO STATE LAWS

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:03.622
REQUIRING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:05.290
REDUCE SOLID WASTE.

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:07.059
BY 75%.

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:08.994
ALSO THE LET'S CALL IT USED A

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:10.262
GLASS MANUFACTURING PROCESS

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:11.363
REQUIRES HIGHER FURNACE

02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:12.864
TEMPERATURES.

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:14.099
THE HOTTER THE FURNACE THE

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:16.401
GREATER THE RELEASE OF

02:11:16.468 --> 02:11:18.470
GREENHOUSE GASES.

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:19.238
LET'S CALL IT USED IN THE

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:20.572
MANUFACTURING PROCESS

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.241
CONTRADICTS THE STATE RECYCLE

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:25.510
GODDET STANDARD OF 35%.

02:11:25.577 --> 02:11:26.778
A GLASS PACKAGING.

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.847
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATE

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:30.449
THAT THE TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:31.516
MILLION STANDARD FOR GLASS

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.652
PACKAGINGIS NOT IN ANY WAY

02:11:33.719 --> 02:11:35.087
HARMFUL.

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.488
AND THAT IS WHY THE MODEL CODE

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:39.124
SETS THAT IS A MAXIMUM CONTENT

02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:40.359
STANDARD.

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:41.360
CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONFORMANCE

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:43.295
STANDARD GLASS PACKAGING TO THE

02:11:43.362 --> 02:11:45.297
MODEL CODE AT TWO HUNDRED PARTS

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.765
MILLION WHICH HELPS THE GLASS

02:11:46.832 --> 02:11:49.668
INDUSTRY MEET SEVERAL OTHER

02:11:49.735 --> 02:11:50.936
IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

YEAR WITH THAT WITH LAWS IN

02:12:39.184 --> 02:12:41.620
EUROPE AND AND AS A RESULT THAT

02:12:41.687 --> 02:12:43.221
WILL ENSURE.

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:43.855
THAT -- WE

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:45.490

USED IN A IN A FURNACE THERE'S A

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.846
ONE TIME REDUCTION OF CARBON AND

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.181
A AND I AND WE THINK THAT'S VERY

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:11.516
IMPORTANT AND AND AND USEFUL FOR

BOTTLES IN THE A NONE OF THE

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:49.020
VERY QUESTION MARK.

02:13:49.087 --> 02:13:50.355
THIS BILL RIVER --

OPPOSITION --

02:14:07.739 --> 02:14:08.640
YES MARK.

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:09.307
I HAVE A MERCURY WITH THE

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:10.342
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS

02:14:10.409 --> 02:14:12.477
AGAINST WASTE AND I I DO WANT TO

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:13.879
RAISE CONCERNS --

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:15.213
I THINK I'VE.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.715
HAVE SOME LEVEL OF TRACK RECORD

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:18.383
AS BEING VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:19.785
GLASS RECYCLING IN THE USE

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:20.886
RECYCLED CONTENT.

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:23.722
ARM AND I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:26.024
TABLE IN SUPPORTING A POLICY

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:28.560
THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT --

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:30.362
IF THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF A LIMIT

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:31.596
ON LEAD --

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.298
IT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.599
CLASS RECYCLING RIGHT BUT THE

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.435
EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:38.003
CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:39.871
YEARS IS THAT THE INVESTMENTS

02:14:39.938 --> 02:14:41.273
THAT CALIFORNIA RECYCLERS.

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.707
IN CALIFORNIA GLASS

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.810
MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUCCEEDED

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.478
ENSURING THAT NONE OF THE

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:48.513
COLLEGE THAT IS GOING INTO

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:49.714
MAKING.

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:52.117
CALIFORNIA MADE GLASS BOTTLES IS

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:56.888
EXCEEDING THE HUNDRED PARTS PER

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:57.622
MILLION STE.

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:59.157
SO THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THIS

02:14:59.224 --> 02:15:01.059
WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT GLASS

02:15:01.126 --> 02:15:01.993
RECYCLING.

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.196
THE WHAT THIS POTENTIALLY WHAT

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:08.066
DO IS CREATE A IN ROAD FOR GLASS

02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:09.634
BOTTLES THAT DON'T MEET THE

02:15:09.701 --> 02:15:10.635
STANDARD.

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:12.771
BEING IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:14.339
BUILDING CALIFORNIA AND THEN

02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:15.474
SOLD.

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:17.309
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:15:17.375 --> 02:15:19.344
HERE TO IT. TO MAINTAIN THIS

02:15:19.411 --> 02:15:20.812
WE'VE WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:23.014
CALIFORNIA OF REDUCING THE

02:15:23.081 --> 02:15:25.217
AMOUNT OF LEAD IN RECYCLE GLASS.

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:26.351
WE SHOULDN'T UNDERMINE THAT

02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:29.754
INVESTMENT.

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.490
I THINK THAT THERE IS A AND WE

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:33.124
SHOULD SUPPORT CALIFORNIA GLASS

02:15:33.191 --> 02:15:34.493
MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:35.727
GLASS RECYCLING.

02:15:35.794 --> 02:15:36.995
I WANT TO ECHO THE POINTS THAT

02:15:37.062 --> 02:15:38.163
SOME OF THE SUPPORT OF SAID I

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.731
DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:40.932
DANGER TO THE CONSUMER.

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:44.102
OF TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.971
OF LEAD IN A GLASS BOTTLE.

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:46.905
NOT GOING TO BE IMPACTED THAT

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:49.341
BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE

02:15:49.407 --> 02:15:50.842
NOT RECYCLING A 100% OF THE

02:15:50.909 --> 02:15:52.077
CLASS GIVEN THE FACT THAT CLASS

02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:53.712
WORKERS ARE INVOLVED.

02:15:53.778 --> 02:15:55.380
IN DEALING WITH CRUSHED GLASS

02:15:55.447 --> 02:15:59.351
BUT HAVING LED IN GLASS OVER ONE

02:15:59.417 --> 02:15:59.985
HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION COULD

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:01.686
HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND

02:16:01.753 --> 02:16:03.221
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:04.589
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.491
TO TO COME UP WITH A FIX HERE.

02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:08.560
TO ENSURE THAT GLASS BOTTLES

02:16:08.627 --> 02:16:10.428
EMPTY GLASS BOTTLES THAT ARE

02:16:10.495 --> 02:16:11.663
IMPORTED INTO THE STATE OF

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:15.433
CALIFORNIA HAVE TO MEET THE SAME

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.034
ONE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION

02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.002
STANDARD.

02:16:17.068 --> 02:16:19.971
CALIFORNIA GLASS RECYCLERS AND

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:20.539
MANUFACTURERS ARE CURRENTLY

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.239
MEETING.

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:23.241
THAT'S MY OBJECTIVE I HAVE EVERY

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:24.376
CONFIDENCE THAT.

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:25.176
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS BILL

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:26.378
MOVING FORWARD THAT ALL OF A

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:28.413
CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH THE

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.083
SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.685
BILL AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:34.319
YOU NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:39.057
I'LL BE TALKED OUT OF IT

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:39.357
[inaudible]

02:16:39.424 --> 02:16:40.458
SENATE CASKEY.

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:40.992
I GUESS STATE [inaudible]

02:16:41.059 --> 02:16:46.998
I ONE AS BEGIN WERE MR MURRAY.

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:50.168
AND IT IS THAT IT APPEARS TO ME

02:16:50.235 --> 02:16:51.870
THAT COLOR THAT'S YOU TRAVéS

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:54.372
CREATED WITH THEM --

FORM PRODUCE GET GLASS ADDS TO

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.276
THE LEVEL OF LEAD.

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:01.446
IN THE RECYCLING OF OF CLASS

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:04.049
PRODUCT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:05.717
THE THE WINE AND SPIRITS

02:17:05.784 --> 02:17:06.885
INDUSTRY.

02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:08.753
BECAUSE IF YOU IT'S MY

02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:10.956
UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILEAN WINE

02:17:11.022 --> 02:17:12.524
WHICH IS VERY POPULAR ABOUT

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:14.459
CONSUMING PUBLIC HERE THE GLASS

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:16.027
IS PRODUCED THERE WHICH DOESN'T

02:17:16.094 --> 02:17:17.829
MEET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS AS A

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:21.232
HIGHER LEVEL OF OF LETTING IT.

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:22.000
I'M JUST WONDERING IS IF THIS IS

02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:23.101
THE TIME WE WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:24.669
BRING IN THE CLASS IN THE

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:25.937
SPIRITS INDUSTRY TO HELP OUT

02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:27.772
MEET THESE LAUDABLE RECYCLING

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:30.642
GOALS THAT THE THAT THE THE BILL.

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:37.082
HOPES TO A CHEAP.

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:37.882
I THINK WHICH WHAT YOU'RE WHAT

02:17:37.949 --> 02:17:39.351
YOU'RE ASKING IS THIS IS THIS

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:42.354
THE TIME TO EXPAND THIS BILL --

IN FROM OTHER OTHER COUNTRIES

02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:49.427
THAT SUPPLY.

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:51.096
YEAH WINE OR SPIRITS OR ANY

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:52.998
OTHER.

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.899
PRODUCTS IN A INCLUDING LAST

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:56.568
FALL I THINK THAT IS.

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.370
ONE WAY OVER EXPANSIVE WHERE WE

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:00.271
WANT TO BE ON THIS BILL THIS

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.973
YEAR BUT I THINK IT DOES HE OWE

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.142
IT MAY RAISE AN ISSUE OF A

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:05.210
FUTURE BILL.

02:18:05.277 --> 02:18:06.544
I IT YOU KNOW IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:18:06.611 --> 02:18:08.079
I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE GLASS

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:09.280
PACKAGING.

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:10.448

IT'S NOT JUST TELLING.

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:16.054
BUT THE BUT THE REALITY IS IS

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:17.589
WHILE THE U. S. GLASS MEETS THE

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:19.391
STANDARD.

02:18:19.457 --> 02:18:20.759

WHAT WHATEVER THE MARKET SHARE

02:18:29.701 --> 02:18:32.537
OF CHILEAN WINES CHINA GOLD

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:34.105
GLASS I THINK IS?

02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:35.874
YUP PROBABLY AMONG AMONG THE

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.575
WORST DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:40.111
MANUFACTURERS.

02:18:40.178 --> 02:18:41.379
A FAR SO WHAT.

02:18:41.446 --> 02:18:42.047
I'M SORRY.

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:43.515
MICROBES I I WASN'T SURE IF I

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:45.450
UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION SO I I I

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:46.651
WELL THE THE GOAL HERE IS THAT

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:48.286
IF WE IF WE IF WE ADOPT THIS

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.822
BILL AND WE RAISE THE LEVEL FROM.

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:51.423
ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED WE

02:18:51.489 --> 02:18:52.524
WILL BE ABLE TO USE MORE

02:18:52.590 --> 02:18:54.025
RECYCLED PRODUCTS.

02:18:54.092 --> 02:18:55.860
RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE VIEWS OF

02:18:55.927 --> 02:18:57.962
PURGING GLASS THE COMING TO TO

02:18:58.029 --> 02:19:00.432
TO MAKE OUR CALIFORNIA BOTTLES.

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:01.900
RIGHT CALIFORNIA POLICY.

02:19:01.966 --> 02:19:03.301
OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL

02:19:03.368 --> 02:19:07.105
HERE ONE OF IN THE INDUSTRY IS

02:19:07.172 --> 02:19:09.007
THAT THE AUTHOR HAS SUGGESTS IS

02:19:09.074 --> 02:19:09.641
THAT.

02:19:09.708 --> 02:19:12.277
SOME OF THE GLASS THAT SOLD HERE

02:19:12.343 --> 02:19:13.912
IN THE WINE AND SPIRIT INDUSTRY.

02:19:13.978 --> 02:19:15.013
WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.382
RECYCLING PROGRAM EXCEEDS THE

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:18.583
ONE HUNDRED LEVEL IN IS ONE OF

02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:20.051
THE REASONS THAT.

02:19:20.118 --> 02:19:21.352
WE'RE NOT MAKING THESE TARGETS

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.788
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM YOU AND

02:19:23.855 --> 02:19:25.623
FROM OTHER OUT OTER.

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:27.559
PEOPLE THAT DO PRODUCE COLLEGE

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:29.160
IS THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:31.229
TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THE OUT

02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:32.130
OF IT BECAUSE THE GLOBS OF THE

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.998
MACHINE SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE

02:19:34.065 --> 02:19:34.733
CAN GET.

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:35.900
OF ALL THE CALIFORNIA BALLS ARE

02:19:35.967 --> 02:19:37.535
AT A HUNDRED THE ONLY WAY THEY

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:39.471
CAN GET ABOVE ONE HUNDRED IS FOR

02:19:39.537 --> 02:19:41.406
IN CLASS THAT'S IN THE FORM OF

02:19:41.473 --> 02:19:43.208
WINE AND SPIRITS BOTTLES.

02:19:43.274 --> 02:19:44.209
THAT EXCEED THAT LEVEL THAT'S

02:19:44.275 --> 02:19:45.577
SORT AYE SOON THAT'S THE REASON

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:47.579
THAT YOU THAT YOU WANT THIS BILL.

02:19:47.645 --> 02:19:49.714
MY QUESTION IS WHY DON'T YOU

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:51.149
JUST BRING ALL THE WIND.

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.451
THE WIND INDUSTRY IN THE SPIRIT

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:58.656
INDUSTRY INTO THE RECYCLING STE.

02:19:58.723 --> 02:20:02.193
THE RECYCLING. TO HELP SOLVE

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:02.827
THAT PROBLEM OKAY I WOULD BE A

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:03.995
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:04.896
DO IT.

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:08.700
NOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION --

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:10.201
THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD

02:20:10.268 --> 02:20:11.469
A GOOD QUESTION FOR THE WINE AND

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:13.037
SPIRITS INDUSTRY WORKING CLASS

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:15.306
BOTTOM MANUFACTURES AND AND I

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:17.509
DON'T HAVE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW

02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:18.042
WHAT THE WINE AND SPIRITS

02:20:18.109 --> 02:20:18.777
INDUSTRY WOULD.

02:20:18.843 --> 02:20:20.311
WOULD THINK OF THAT IDEA IF THAT

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:25.450
IF THAT'S ACTUALLY NOW NOW THAT

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:29.020
I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION --

02:20:29.087 --> 02:20:29.988
SENATOR DOT.

02:20:30.054 --> 02:20:34.926
SAYS I'M [inaudible]

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:35.660
OKAY [inaudible]

02:20:35.727 --> 02:20:39.164
I'M.

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.232
ABSOLUTELY THE FACT THAT --

02:20:41.299 --> 02:20:43.668
GLASS AND ALUMINUM.

02:20:43.735 --> 02:20:46.371
ARE TWO OF THE MATERIALS.

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.406
THAT WE ARE STILL GETTING OF

02:20:48.473 --> 02:20:49.140
BENEFIT.

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.442
FROM IN TERMS OF STRAIGHT CARBON

02:20:51.509 --> 02:20:52.610
REDUCTION [inaudible]

02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:54.212
AND OVERALL.

02:20:54.279 --> 02:20:57.482
REDUCTION IN ENERGY USE BY.

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:58.883
COLLECTING THEM IN

02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:00.652
REMANUFACTURING.

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:02.120
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:04.322
OTHER MATERIALS THAT WE COLLECT

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:05.523
AND EITHER DON'T GET RE

02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:07.325
MANUFACTURED OR MAYBE SOME DAYS

02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:08.660
YOU WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT SAME

02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:10.862
BENEFIT SO FOR THAT REASON WE

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:12.730
WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:14.232
DEFINITELY ANSWER THAT WE ARE

02:21:14.299 --> 02:21:17.035
MAXIMIZING CLASS RECYCLING AND

02:21:17.101 --> 02:21:19.270
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE USE OF

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:20.772
GLASS PRODUCT [inaudible]

02:21:20.839 --> 02:21:25.810
AND I ANYWAY SO BUT I DO

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:26.110
[inaudible]

02:21:26.177 --> 02:21:30.415
I DO --

02:21:30.481 --> 02:21:32.183
GLASSES INERT I DON'T HAVE THE

02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:33.818
FEAR THAT I WILL GET THE LEAD.

02:21:33.885 --> 02:21:35.553
WHEN I DRINK IT?

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:36.688
I'M SOMETHING OUT OF THAT GLASS

02:21:36.754 --> 02:21:38.656
BOTTLE.

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.925
BUT WHAT IS THE EXPOSURE TO OUR

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:41.960
FOLKS.

02:21:42.026 --> 02:21:43.728
THEY ARE USING A HIGHER LEAD

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:46.164
CONTENT WHAT DO WE KNOW YET.

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:48.066
WHAT THE WHAT THE POSSIBLE

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:51.603
EXPOSURE IS THEN TO THE WORKER

02:21:51.669 --> 02:21:54.739
WITH THAT HIGHER LET?

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:58.109
NO BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S AM.

02:21:58.176 --> 02:21:59.310
I KNOW THAT THERE THAT YOU DON'T

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:00.812
THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:02.647
SAFETY AND HEALTH AND TOXINS AND

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:03.014
ALL.

02:22:03.081 --> 02:22:05.149
THAT THAT'S I MEAN THERE IT'S

02:22:05.216 --> 02:22:06.718
THAT'S IN THERE BAILIWICK AND I

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.319
I WOULD ASSUME --

02:22:08.386 --> 02:22:15.493
I I'M I'M I WILL JUST THE GLASS.

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:17.028
IS A LOT OF ACTORS ARE ARE ARE

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:21.032
SAFE WERE IT'S A SAFE WORKING

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:24.168
ENVIRONMENT AND GLASS WORKERS DO

02:22:24.235 --> 02:22:25.103
SUPPORT BILL SO I DON'T KNOW

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.070
YEAH AND THAT I KNOW TOO BUT I

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:26.838
JUST IT'S I JUST THINK IT IS A

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:28.039
LEGITIMATE.

02:22:28.106 --> 02:22:30.541
POINT THAT WE COULD BE BY

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:32.644
RAISING IT EXPOSING OUR OWN

02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:34.145
WORKERS TO MORE LET AND WE MIGHT

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:36.948
WANT TO AND THEN --

02:22:37.015 --> 02:22:38.216
SURE YOU COULD GET IT OUGHT.

02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:39.183
TO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:40.585
FIGURE OUT AND I GUESS I'M GOING

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:41.786
TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND

02:22:41.853 --> 02:22:43.021
ALL EVEN MOVE IT BUT WHAT I'M.

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:43.821
HOPING.

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:46.391
IS THAT WE CAN'T DESIGN AS THE

02:22:46.457 --> 02:22:47.792
BILL MOVES FORWARD IS THERE A

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:50.528
WAY TO DESIGN SOME SORT OF

02:22:50.595 --> 02:22:53.898
INCENTIVE [inaudible] TO OR SOME

02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:54.899
SORT OF WAITING GET.

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:56.434
GLASS THAT COMING INTO THE

02:22:56.501 --> 02:22:57.769
COUNTRY THAT IS.

02:22:57.835 --> 02:23:00.638
HI LED TO GET OUT A LOWER LET.

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:03.541
SO THAT WE SO BECAUSE I DO NOT

02:23:03.608 --> 02:23:04.642
WANT.

02:23:04.709 --> 02:23:06.477
TO MESS UP OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM

02:23:06.544 --> 02:23:08.846
OR LIMIT OUR USE REUSE A GLASS.

02:23:08.913 --> 02:23:10.448
BUT I ALSO WANT TO GET THAT LED

02:23:10.515 --> 02:23:12.784
OUT SO I KNOW THERE'S ARE TWO

02:23:12.850 --> 02:23:14.218
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT GOALS.

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:16.020
BUT I THINK I CAN I CAN DO A

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:17.422
BETTER JOB OF ANSWERING THIS

02:23:17.488 --> 02:23:19.457
QUESTION NOW THAT I THOUGHT IF

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:23.494
THIS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT. FOR

02:23:23.561 --> 02:23:24.095
FOR ONE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

02:23:24.162 --> 02:23:24.729
IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S

02:23:24.796 --> 02:23:29.033
ON IN THE COLOR THE BROKEN THE

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.134
THE NETWORKING OF GLASS.

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:31.769
EAT ANY ANY METAL IN HEAVY METAL

02:23:31.836 --> 02:23:33.504
IN THE IN THE IN THE GLASS IT'S

02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:35.640
IN THE MATRIX OF THE GLASS IT'S

02:23:35.707 --> 02:23:37.675
IT'S IT'S A LOT ABOUT IT WE

WAY OF TAXING SO WHILE THE

02:55:07.296 --> 02:55:08.231
VERY LITTLE TO TRICKLE DOWN TO

02:55:08.297 --> 02:55:10.132

02:55:12.501 --> 02:55:15.338
WAS IT WAS WAS HOW DIFFICULT IT

02:55:15.404 --> 02:55:16.706

BENEFIT.

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:27.016

SIGNIFICANTLY.

02:55:46.102 --> 02:55:46.802

AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WHO NEED

02:55:54.577 --> 02:55:55.211
THEM.

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:56.445
THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT FORTY

02:55:56.512 --> 02:55:57.179
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AROUND

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.514
THE WORLD THAT HAVE ADOPTED SOME

02:55:58.581 --> 02:55:59.649
FORM OF CARBON PRICING WITH THE

02:55:59.715 --> 02:56:01.117
GOAL OF REDUCING EMISSIONS

02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:02.551
THROUGH CHANGING CONSUMER

02:56:02.618 --> 02:56:04.086
BEHAVIOR AT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE

02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:04.954
NETHERLANDS.

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.188
DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC CARBON

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:07.590
TAX IT --

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:08.491
THERE WOULD BE CITY PURSUANT TO

02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:10.326
THIS BILL ACCOUNTS SHOW THAT DAY

02:56:10.393 --> 02:56:12.428
CURRENTLY PRICE ABOUT 94% OF

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:14.397
THEIR OWN EMISSIONS CAUSED BY

02:56:14.463 --> 02:56:15.765
THE ENERGY USE IN IN THE

02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:16.632
NETHERLANDS SO.

02:56:16.699 --> 02:56:18.301
I EMISSIONS CAUSED BY

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:20.803
AGRICULTURE AND FISHING ROAD

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:21.704
OTHERS THAT ARE TAX IN THE

02:56:21.771 --> 02:56:24.206
NETHERLANDS SO THIS IS MERELY A

02:56:24.273 --> 02:56:24.540
STUDY BILL --

02:56:24.607 --> 02:56:26.375
BUT IT WOULD AT IT ASKS THE THE

02:56:26.442 --> 02:56:27.677
FOLKS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

02:56:27.743 --> 02:56:28.844
IDEA.

02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:31.013
AND AND I JUST WANT --

02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:32.315
TO TO PREVENT THE SIZE THAT IF

02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:33.816
IT ULTIMATELY ENDS UP THAT THEY

02:56:33.883 --> 02:56:35.184
TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THIS

02:56:35.251 --> 02:56:36.619
AND DECIDE THAT EVEN IF IT'S A

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:38.087
GREAT IDEA CONCEPTUALLY BUT IT'S

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:40.122
JUST TOO IMPRACTICAL. TO IMPOSE

02:56:40.189 --> 02:56:41.791
BECAUSE FIGURING OUT THE CARBON

02:56:41.857 --> 02:56:43.726
PRICES IT WITH INITIAL PROJECT

02:56:43.793 --> 02:56:43.993
PRODUCT --

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.628
IS GONNA BE TOO DIFFICULT --

02:56:45.695 --> 02:56:47.163
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AND IN

02:56:47.229 --> 02:56:48.397
FACT THE BEAR BUT MAY JUST COME

02:56:48.464 --> 02:56:49.498
BACK TO US AND SAY LOOK YOU KNOW

02:56:49.565 --> 02:56:51.033
IT'S IT'S TOO IMPRACTICAL BUT WE

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:52.702
DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR US

02:56:52.768 --> 02:56:54.070
TO LOOK AT TO CONSIDER.

02:56:54.136 --> 02:56:55.604
AND I I DO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT

02:56:55.671 --> 02:56:57.006
THIS IS A REVENUE NEUTRAL IDEA

02:56:57.073 --> 02:56:58.607
THAT WRE ALREADY WE HAVE A

02:56:58.674 --> 02:56:59.742
REGRESSIVE TAX IN PLACE IN THE

02:56:59.809 --> 02:57:01.544
FORM OF THE SALES TAX WE WOULD

02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:03.012
GET RID OF THAT STATE SALES TAX

02:57:03.079 --> 02:57:04.447
ALTOGETHER IF THIS --

02:57:04.513 --> 02:57:06.015
AND AND AND AND STUDY THE IDEA

02:57:06.082 --> 02:57:07.249
OF REPLACING IT WITH A REVENUE

02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:09.618
NEUTRAL CARBON TAX WITH ME TODAY

02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:10.152
WE HAVE --

02:57:10.219 --> 02:57:13.656
MICHELLE Và SERAPHINA TO

02:57:13.723 --> 02:57:14.290
CONSERVANCY WAS GONNA TESTIFY IN

02:57:14.357 --> 02:57:15.624
SUPPORT.

02:57:15.691 --> 02:57:16.559
I THANK HIM SHALL PASS FROM THE

03:01:58.641 --> 03:02:00.276
SUCH AS THE WHERE THE STEELERS

03:02:00.342 --> 03:02:01.577
MANUFACTURED SO SOME OF OUR

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:03.379
MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:05.114
FACILITY THERE IN TWO PLACES IN

03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:06.348
CALIFORNIA.

03:02:06.415 --> 03:02:07.516
YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO THE

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:11.320
DIFFERENT LOW FOR ANYA.

03:02:11.387 --> 03:02:12.788
GO INTO THAT CARBON INTENSITY.

03:02:12.855 --> 03:02:15.958
THE LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS IS AN

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:17.192
ENTIRE DIVISION WITHIN CARP.

03:02:17.259 --> 03:02:18.627
ON IT SAID IT'S A VERY INTENSE

03:02:18.694 --> 03:02:20.262
STUDY IN A VERY INTENSE

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:21.563
VALUATION --

03:02:21.630 --> 03:02:23.799
I ALSO WANTED TO RAISE AN ISSUE

03:02:23.866 --> 03:02:25.801
THAT WE DID TALK TO THE A CENTER

03:02:25.868 --> 03:02:27.603
STAFF ABOUT WHICH IS DATA

03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:28.504
GATHERING AND I THINK THIS IS

03:02:28.570 --> 03:02:29.838
RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE THE

03:02:29.905 --> 03:02:31.307
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. FOR

03:02:31.373 --> 03:02:32.574
BUSINESSES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

03:02:32.641 --> 03:02:34.743
THE WAIT DATA WOULD BE GATHERED

03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:36.278
AND WOULD BE REPORTED AND THEN

03:02:36.345 --> 03:02:37.813
HOW WE WOULD MAINTAIN THE

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:39.348
PRIVACY OF THAT DATA THAT WOULD

03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:40.883
BE SHARED WITH THE IT RESOURCES

03:02:40.949 --> 03:02:41.617
BOARD.

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:42.785
ON WHEELS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

03:02:42.851 --> 03:02:44.653
HOW DO YOU GET THAT DATA FROM

03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:46.255
OUT OF STATE PARTS THAT COME

03:02:46.322 --> 03:02:47.523
INTO CALIFORNIA.

03:02:47.589 --> 03:02:48.757
THERE'S A LOT OF INTERPLAY IN

03:02:48.824 --> 03:02:52.461
JUST THE CARBON INTENSITY

03:02:52.528 --> 03:02:54.263
EVALUATION ALLOWED.

03:02:54.330 --> 03:02:54.863
THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF IF

03:02:54.930 --> 03:02:56.031
WE'RE GOING TO CHANG THE MARKET

03:02:56.098 --> 03:02:57.800
PLACE IN THE WAY BUYERS PURCHASE

03:02:57.866 --> 03:02:59.234
PRODUCTS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

03:02:59.301 --> 03:03:00.836
BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IS AN

03:03:00.903 --> 03:03:02.438
ENTIRE FIELD OF STUDY.

03:03:02.504 --> 03:03:03.639
THAT WAS REALLY BROUGHT INTO

03:03:03.706 --> 03:03:04.740
LIGHT IN THE EIGHTIES AND

03:03:04.807 --> 03:03:06.342
NINETIES WE DON'T HAVE A LOT AN

03:03:06.408 --> 03:03:08.143
AGENCY THAT REALLY LOOKS AT HOW

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:10.279
TO CONSUMERS MAKE PURCHASING

03:03:10.346 --> 03:03:11.146
DECISIONS.

03:03:11.213 --> 03:03:12.381
THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS WOULD

03:03:12.448 --> 03:03:14.149
ENTAIL THINGS LIKE RE DOING

03:03:14.216 --> 03:03:15.484
RETAIL POINT OF SALE PRODUCTS

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:17.586
TOM HOW DO WE PUT LABELS ON THE

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:19.054
SHELVES SO CONSUMERS REALLY

03:03:19.121 --> 03:03:20.622
UNDERSTAND WHAT PORTION OF THE

03:03:20.689 --> 03:03:21.423
TAXES ARE.

03:03:21.490 --> 03:03:23.359
RESULTING FROM HIGHER LUXURY

03:03:23.425 --> 03:03:24.626
GOOD AND WHAT PORTION THE TACK

03:03:24.693 --> 03:03:25.728
OR PORTION OF THE PRICES

03:03:25.794 --> 03:03:28.230
RESULTING FROM THE CARBON TAX.

03:03:28.297 --> 03:03:29.198
WE REALLY NEED WHOEVER'S

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:32.634
EVALUATING ALL THOSE ASPECTS

03:03:32.701 --> 03:03:34.303
FROM THE MARKET PLACE --

03:03:34.370 --> 03:03:35.471
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE

03:03:35.537 --> 03:03:36.538
HAD EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN TO

03:03:36.605 --> 03:03:37.573
THE CENTERS OFFICE ABOUT

03:03:37.639 --> 03:03:38.907
INCLUDING MORE THAN JUST CARBON

03:03:38.974 --> 03:03:40.376
THE DEPARTMENT TAX WE THINK

03:03:40.442 --> 03:03:41.443
OTHER --

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:42.678
AGENCIES ALSO BE INCLUDED IN

03:03:42.745 --> 03:03:44.780
THIS EVALUATION BECAUSE THIS IS

03:03:44.847 --> 03:03:46.448
OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL SCOPE OF

03:03:46.515 --> 03:03:48.183
WHAT CAR DOES WE WERE TALKING

03:03:48.250 --> 03:03:49.251
ABOUT OVERHAULING THE TAX

03:03:49.318 --> 03:03:51.286
STRUCTURE THIS IS THIS IS A BIG

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:52.521
STUDY -- AND

03:03:52.588 --> 03:03:53.655
FINALLY WANTED TO TOUCH ON

03:03:53.722 --> 03:03:55.057
CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE

03:03:55.124 --> 03:03:56.825
ENVIRONMENTAL WORLD I MEAN WE

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:59.762
HAVE WE HAVE A THEY THEY ARE CAP

03:03:59.828 --> 03:04:01.530
AND TRADE PROGRAM.

03:04:01.597 --> 03:04:02.865
AND THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM

03:04:02.931 --> 03:04:04.032
NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO

03:04:04.099 --> 03:04:06.068
CONSIDERATION WILL THIS CARBON

03:04:06.135 --> 03:04:08.370
TAX REPLACE ALL OF OUR CARBON

03:04:08.437 --> 03:04:09.571
POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA.

03:04:09.638 --> 03:04:12.841
WILL EVALUATING A CARBON TAX.

03:04:12.908 --> 03:04:15.244
DISCOURAGE OTHER STATES FROM

03:04:15.310 --> 03:04:16.812
INVESTING AND LINKING WITH OUR

03:04:16.879 --> 03:04:17.880
CAP AND TRADE.

03:04:17.946 --> 03:04:19.381
I THINK IT'S PART OF THE STUDY

03:04:19.448 --> 03:04:19.982
ONE OF THE HINGS WE WOULD ANT

03:04:20.048 --> 03:04:21.016
TO MAKE SURE THAT CARD IS

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:22.918
LOOKING AT IS THE IMPACTS ON THE

03:04:22.985 --> 03:04:24.553
OTHER CARBON POLICIES.

03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:26.588
IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING WHETHER

03:04:26.655 --> 03:04:28.757
WE HAVE CREDITS FOR FACILITIES

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:30.459
THAT ARE ALREADY SUBJECT CAPPING

03:04:30.526 --> 03:04:31.960
TRADER OTHER CARBON EMISSIONS.

03:04:32.027 --> 03:04:32.895
AND WE THINK WE NEED TO DO A

03:04:32.961 --> 03:04:33.996
FULL EVALUATION OF THAT

03:04:34.062 --> 03:04:35.063
INCLUDING THE IMPACTS ON

03:04:35.130 --> 03:04:36.532
TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS WHICH

03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:38.801
MIGHT RESULT FROM THE DECREASING

03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:40.335
CONSUMPTION FOOL FUEL --

03:04:40.402 --> 03:04:42.538
AND INCLUDING THE DECREASE IN

03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:45.808
OVERALL A A COME TO THE STATE.

03:04:45.874 --> 03:04:47.009
OF THESE REASONS WE'VE WE'VE WE

03:04:47.075 --> 03:04:49.011
APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE

03:04:49.077 --> 03:04:50.078
OFFICE TO WORK WITH US AND WILL

03:04:50.145 --> 03:04:54.383
CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT FOR THESE

03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:54.917
REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE LESS

03:04:54.983 --> 03:04:55.517
AMENDED [inaudible]

03:04:55.584 --> 03:04:58.086
NECKS.

03:04:58.153 --> 03:05:00.355
THANK YOU MY NAME IS DERAIL COOK

03:05:00.422 --> 03:05:02.024
I'M HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:03.859
MANUFACTURERS AND ASSOCIATION.

03:05:03.926 --> 03:05:07.996
WE ALL THOSE TO THIS BILL WE

03:05:08.063 --> 03:05:08.964
RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT WE ARE

03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:10.132
EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND WE

03:05:10.199 --> 03:05:12.568
INTEND TO HAVE MORE ENGAGEMENT

03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:14.036
WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF --

03:05:14.102 --> 03:05:16.805
AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD --

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:18.073
THE REASON WHY WE ARE OPPOSE

03:05:18.140 --> 03:05:19.608
EVEN THOUGH THE BILL IS A STUDY

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:22.244
BILL IS NO MATTER HOW WE DEVISE

03:05:22.311 --> 03:05:24.713
A CARBON TAX AT THE STATE LEVEL.

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:25.981
IT'S GOING TO HAVE DEEP ISSUES

03:05:26.048 --> 03:05:27.282
OF WORK ABILITY AND INVITE

03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:28.784
ARBITRARINESS THAT WILL

03:05:28.851 --> 03:05:30.252
ULTIMATELY DISADVANTAGED

03:05:30.319 --> 03:05:31.119
CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING

03:05:31.186 --> 03:05:33.021
INDUSTRY AND STYMIE OUR ABILITY

03:05:33.088 --> 03:05:34.022
TO COMPETE WITH OUR OUR OUR

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:36.091
GLOBAL COMPETITION.

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:36.658
WE INTEND TO DISCUSS THOSE

03:05:36.725 --> 03:05:37.759
ISSUES.

03:05:37.826 --> 03:05:39.428
MORE IN DEPTH AS THERE WERE A AS

03:05:39.495 --> 03:05:40.829
THIS BILL MOVES FOWARD INTO --

03:05:40.896 --> 03:05:42.164
COMMITTEES RELATED TO TAX

03:05:42.231 --> 03:05:44.066
POLICIES THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF

03:05:44.132 --> 03:05:44.399
OUR ISSUES --

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:45.801
FIT -- BUT

03:05:45.868 --> 03:05:46.935
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE WANT TO

03:05:47.002 --> 03:05:48.904
EMPHASIZE THAT THE APPROACH THAT

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:49.638
THIS --

03:05:49.705 --> 03:05:51.940
CARBON TAX REPRESENTS BURNS TO

03:05:52.007 --> 03:05:52.608
UPSET THE BALANCE THAT WE

03:05:52.674 --> 03:05:53.475
REACHED.

03:05:53.542 --> 03:05:55.511
WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH

03:05:55.577 --> 03:05:57.246
RELATION TO A CAP AND TRADE OF

03:05:57.312 --> 03:05:58.747
MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN AT THE

03:05:58.814 --> 03:06:00.349
TABLE AS PARTNERS TO THAT

03:06:00.415 --> 03:06:05.687
SOLUTION AND OTHER EFFORTS. TO

03:06:05.754 --> 03:06:07.089
REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS.

03:06:07.155 --> 03:06:08.090
NOW WE ARE INVESTING IN --

03:06:08.156 --> 03:06:09.124
M. PRODUCING SOLUTIONS IN

03:06:09.191 --> 03:06:11.560
AMERICAN SYSTEM OF CAP AND TRADE --

03:06:11.627 --> 03:06:13.629
TO TO PRODUCE MORE GREENLEE AND

03:06:13.695 --> 03:06:16.098
D. CARBONIZED CALIFORNIA --

03:06:16.164 --> 03:06:17.199
THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS ARE

03:06:17.266 --> 03:06:19.301
THREATENED IF WE MAKE IT USING

03:06:19.368 --> 03:06:21.603
CALIFORNIA AND THE CARBON TAX

03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:22.905
REPRESENTS SUCH A THREAT A

03:06:22.971 --> 03:06:25.073
MANUFACTURER'S ALREADY FACE THE

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:27.643
HIGHEST ENERGY COSTS IN THE

03:06:27.709 --> 03:06:28.410
NATION --

03:06:28.477 --> 03:06:31.547
AND COMPOUNDING THOSE COSTS WITH

03:06:31.613 --> 03:06:33.348
THE COST OF UP.

03:06:33.415 --> 03:06:35.284
REBEKAH ACQUIRING COMPONENTS

03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:36.919
ONLY INCREASES OUR COSTS AS WE

03:06:36.985 --> 03:06:38.587
FACE THE SAME ISSUE AS WE HAVE

03:06:38.654 --> 03:06:40.088
WITH OTHER THAT CHANGES TO THE

03:06:40.155 --> 03:06:41.990
TAX SCHEME WHERE ARE COMPONENTS

03:06:42.057 --> 03:06:44.726
THAT WE ACQUIRE WILL FACE A TAX --

03:06:44.793 --> 03:06:46.028
AND THEN WE ALTERNATE LEAVE AND

03:06:46.094 --> 03:06:47.829
HAVE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT

03:06:47.896 --> 03:06:50.299
HAVE BEEN TAX RAISING PRICES OF

03:06:50.365 --> 03:06:53.001
THE GOODS THAT WE PRODUCE --

03:06:53.068 --> 03:06:54.636
SO.

03:06:54.703 --> 03:06:56.004
IN.

03:06:56.071 --> 03:06:57.940
THE END RESULT IS THE CARBON TAX --

03:06:58.006 --> 03:06:59.374
THAT A CARBON TAX ULTIMATELY

03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:00.075
ENCOURAGES OUT OF STATE

03:07:00.142 --> 03:07:01.810
PRODUCTION A BECAUSE OF CERTAIN

03:07:01.877 --> 03:07:03.612
SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL ISSUES

03:07:03.679 --> 03:07:04.713
WITH THE CARBON TAX AT THE STATE

03:07:04.780 --> 03:07:05.681
LEVEL THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN

03:07:05.747 --> 03:07:07.215
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHERE WE

03:07:07.282 --> 03:07:09.751
pCONTROLS --

03:07:09.818 --> 03:07:11.286
AND AND IN DOING SO THAT'S

03:07:11.353 --> 03:07:12.788
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR OUR

03:07:12.854 --> 03:07:14.890
GREEN GOALS HERE BECAUSE WHAT

03:07:14.957 --> 03:07:16.491
HAPPENS IS LEAKAGE CALIFORNIA

03:07:16.558 --> 03:07:17.859
MANUFACTURERS WE BECOMES TOO

03:07:17.926 --> 03:07:19.061
HARD TO PRODUCE --

03:07:19.127 --> 03:07:20.796
DO SO OUT OF STATE AND IF WE

03:07:20.862 --> 03:07:22.497
DON'T PRODUCE OUT OF STATE WHAT

03:07:22.564 --> 03:07:24.833
HAPPENS THAT WE ARE OUT COMPETED

03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:26.101
BY FOLKS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

03:07:26.168 --> 03:07:27.102
AND OTHER STATES DON'T HAVE

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:28.236
THESE --

03:07:28.303 --> 03:07:31.607
CARBON CAPTURING --

03:07:32.674 --> 03:07:36.445
THOSE REASONS BUT WE ARE POST.

03:08:08.243 --> 03:08:11.113
HOW.

03:08:11.179 --> 03:08:14.282
HOW HONEST WERE BEING ABOUT?

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:16.385
OUR PROGRESS IN IN THIS STATE ON

03:08:16.451 --> 03:08:17.919
CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S ONE

03:08:17.986 --> 03:08:21.223
THING. TO TO HEAR THE A CARBON

03:08:21.289 --> 03:08:22.991
TARGET -- BY

03:08:23.058 --> 03:08:24.860
TWENTY THIRTY FROM ALL SOURCES

03:08:24.926 --> 03:08:26.728
OF EMISSIONS THAT WE CONTRACT IN

03:08:26.795 --> 03:08:29.097
STATE LIKE A MANUFACTURER.

03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:30.999
OUR UTILITY --

03:08:31.066 --> 03:08:33.669
OUR DRIVER BUT WE CONSUME A LOT

03:08:33.735 --> 03:08:35.737
OF THINGS WE THINGS MOVE IN AND

03:08:35.804 --> 03:08:37.105
OUT THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A

03:08:37.172 --> 03:08:40.142
LOT MORE TO THE STORY THAN JUST --

03:08:40.208 --> 03:08:41.910
THE WAY WE SORT OF TARGET

03:08:41.977 --> 03:08:43.311
SOURCES RIGHT NOW SOME.

03:08:43.378 --> 03:08:46.448
I I GET THE INITIAL VERSION FROM

03:08:46.515 --> 03:08:47.783
FROM INDUSTRY.

03:08:47.849 --> 03:08:48.917
THIS OUR CONCEPT I THINK JUST

03:08:48.984 --> 03:08:50.052
FLOATING THE WORD TAX EVEN OUT

03:08:50.118 --> 03:08:51.753
THERE IMMEDIATELY IS GOING TO

03:08:51.820 --> 03:08:53.689
SET PEOPLE OFF BUT I DO THINK

03:08:53.755 --> 03:08:55.390
THAT.

03:08:55.457 --> 03:08:56.792
I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT

03:08:56.858 --> 03:08:58.293
THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY

03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:01.930
DISCRIMINATORY ABOUT --

03:09:01.997 --> 03:09:05.967
LOOKING AT A MORE ACCURATE --

03:09:06.034 --> 03:09:08.637
ASSESSMENT OF SORT OF WHERE THE

03:09:08.704 --> 03:09:11.073
CAR BEEN IS --

03:09:11.139 --> 03:09:13.575
BEING EMITTED IN OTHER WORDS --

03:09:13.642 --> 03:09:14.676
I THINK THAT IN STATE

03:09:14.743 --> 03:09:16.812
MANUFACTURERS PRODUCERS AND

03:09:16.878 --> 03:09:18.046
OTHERS.

03:09:18.113 --> 03:09:19.381
HE COULD POTENTIALLY GAIN IF YOU

03:09:19.448 --> 03:09:21.283
CAN GET OVER THE CONSTITUTIONAL

03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:22.517
CONCERNS WHICH I THINK ARE

03:09:22.584 --> 03:09:23.552
UNDERLYING.

03:09:23.618 --> 03:09:24.553
THE MTA'S POINT OF YOU WHERE

03:09:24.619 --> 03:09:27.155
THEY'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T IMPOSE

03:09:27.222 --> 03:09:27.589
A DORMANT.

03:09:27.656 --> 03:09:28.590
A CARBON PRICE IN A WAY THAT

03:09:28.657 --> 03:09:29.725
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST --

03:09:29.791 --> 03:09:33.328
INTERSTATE COMMERCE BUT SOMEONE

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:34.596
WORTH LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD

03:09:34.663 --> 03:09:35.964
IF YOU IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO

03:09:36.031 --> 03:09:38.834
LOOK AT A NON DISCRIMINATORY

03:09:38.900 --> 03:09:40.802
ASSESSMENT ON THE CARBON SIDE

03:09:40.869 --> 03:09:43.672
AND IT YEAH AND THEN IN A WAY

03:09:43.739 --> 03:09:44.306
THAT.

03:09:44.372 --> 03:09:45.373
YOU'RE WEIGHING THE HEALTH AND

03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:46.842
SAFETY BURNS ON THE STATE.

03:09:46.908 --> 03:09:47.709
AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:09:47.776 --> 03:09:49.845
PURPOSE OF THIS BECAUSE I DON'T

03:09:49.911 --> 03:09:51.146
SEE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS HER

03:09:51.213 --> 03:09:52.214
SURE BIASING ONE INDUSTRY

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:53.682
AGAINST ANOTHER BUT MORE SO JUST

03:09:53.749 --> 03:09:55.550
TRYING TO GET IN ON THIS PICTURE

03:09:55.617 --> 03:09:56.685
OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SELF

03:09:56.752 --> 03:09:57.853
SO MANY CONSIDER GOING FOR TO

03:09:57.919 --> 03:09:59.621
HAPPEN MOVE THE BILL. TO THE

03:09:59.688 --> 03:10:00.288
APPROPRIATE TIME.

03:10:00.355 --> 03:10:03.792
EXACTLY IN HERE I I JUST WANT TO

03:10:03.859 --> 03:10:05.327
SAY -- YOU

03:10:05.393 --> 03:10:06.027
KNOW A COUPLE KEY THINGS IN

03:10:06.094 --> 03:10:07.295
RESPONSE TO MY FRIENDS FROM FROM

03:10:07.362 --> 03:10:08.396
FROM INDUSTRY --

03:10:08.463 --> 03:10:13.101
IF IF THIS. SIX TWO IF IF IF.

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:14.669
IT IS ABSOLUTE NOT MY INTENTION

03:10:14.736 --> 03:10:16.071
IN FACT I WOULD OPPOSE ANY

03:10:16.138 --> 03:10:18.440
ATTEMPT. TO MAKE THIS BILL INTO

03:10:18.507 --> 03:10:20.041
SOMETHING THAT DISADVANTAGES

03:10:20.108 --> 03:10:21.877
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS.

03:10:21.943 --> 03:10:22.778
THAT IS.

03:10:22.844 --> 03:10:24.112
IT WOULD IT WOULD OP SEE CENTRAL

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.113
TO THIS.

03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:28.350
IS A A FIFTH ANYTHING IF

03:10:28.416 --> 03:10:29.851
ANYTHING THE MANUFACTURES WITH

03:10:29.918 --> 03:10:31.019
THIS A CALIFORNIA WOULD WOULD

03:10:31.086 --> 03:10:32.687
LIKELY HAVE MORE TO GAIN FROM

03:10:32.754 --> 03:10:35.190
SOMETHING LIKE THIS --

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:35.791
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:39.027
TEND FOLKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

03:10:39.094 --> 03:10:40.562
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD --

03:10:40.629 --> 03:10:41.596
SO SO THE OTHER I JUST WANNA

03:10:41.663 --> 03:10:45.367
MAKE THAT IT ENORMOUSLY CLEAR --

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:47.536
THAT -- THE

03:10:47.602 --> 03:10:48.370
THIS THIS THIS THEY THEY THEY

03:10:48.436 --> 03:10:51.273
DID IT WE CANNOT BE THAT ARE

03:10:51.339 --> 03:10:52.307
ANYTHING THAT WILL COME OUT OF

03:10:52.374 --> 03:10:53.842
THIS BILL.

03:10:53.909 --> 03:10:55.443
WOULD --

03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:58.046
DECIDE TO JUST PRICE BASED ON

03:10:58.113 --> 03:10:59.781
CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING IS

03:10:59.848 --> 03:11:01.483
TOO DIFFICULT TO ORDER TO ANY

03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:02.150
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED

03:11:02.217 --> 03:11:03.718
WITH -- WITH

03:11:03.785 --> 03:11:05.253
WITH WITH LOOKING A PRODUCTS

03:11:05.320 --> 03:11:06.955
COMING FROM OUT OF THE STATE AND

03:11:07.022 --> 03:11:08.723
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO PURSUE.

03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:09.858
ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES OF THIS

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:12.093
IF IF IT WERE IF THAT WERE NOT

03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:13.094
TO BE THE CASE.

03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:13.895
I MEANONE CAN IMAGINE THE STAFF

03:11:13.962 --> 03:11:15.430
REPORT TALKS ABOUT --

03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:17.432
THE REGRESSIVE NATURE THE ALLEY --

03:11:17.499 --> 03:11:19.768
AND THREE FIFTY REPORTED ON IT

03:11:19.835 --> 03:11:22.103
BUT ONE COULD IMAGINE --

03:11:22.170 --> 03:11:24.840
AND AIRPORT TAX FOR MEASURING

03:11:24.906 --> 03:11:26.908
THE CARBON THAT YOU USE ON THE

03:11:26.975 --> 03:11:28.810
FLIGHT AS YOU EXIT IN THE FLIGHT

03:11:28.877 --> 03:11:30.512
IF YOU COME IN DOESN'T AFFECT

03:11:30.579 --> 03:11:31.246
MANUFACTURING.

03:11:31.313 --> 03:11:32.480
THE NOT A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE GET

03:11:32.547 --> 03:11:33.682
NON -- A

03:11:33.748 --> 03:11:34.549
FLIGHT -- TO

03:11:34.616 --> 03:11:36.518
INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS BUT

03:11:36.585 --> 03:11:37.352
CALCULATE THAT CARBON BECAUSE WE

03:11:37.419 --> 03:11:39.321
CAN'T TAX THE FUEL BECAUSE

03:11:39.387 --> 03:11:41.122
THAT'S FEDERAL REGULATION BUT WE

03:11:41.189 --> 03:11:44.125
COULD TAX THE MILES THEY WERE --

03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:44.793
SOMEBODY.

03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:46.795
THE SMARTER THAN I AM COULD

03:11:46.862 --> 03:11:49.965
CALCULATE WHAT GREENHOUSE GASES

03:11:50.031 --> 03:11:52.067
WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING ACROSS THE

03:11:52.133 --> 03:11:53.902
THE PLACE AND IT'S IT'S NEUTRAL

03:11:53.969 --> 03:11:55.604
TO THE CHAMBER NEUTRAL TO THE

03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:56.872
MANUFACTURERS.

03:11:56.938 --> 03:11:58.607
N. AND IT'S NOT.

03:11:58.673 --> 03:12:01.877
IT'S NOT PER SE --

03:12:01.943 --> 03:12:03.144
REGRESSIVE I MEAN THAT THAT

03:12:03.211 --> 03:12:04.846
AVERAGE SMALL THEIR AVERAGE POOR

03:12:04.913 --> 03:12:06.081
FAMILY GOES ONE TRIP TO

03:12:06.147 --> 03:12:07.148
DISNEYLAND IS NOT GOING TO FEEL

03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:08.683
IT FIRST IS THE INTERNATIONAL

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:09.985
TRAVELER TRAVELER FROM MARIN

03:12:10.051 --> 03:12:12.254
COUNTY THAT'S TAKEN. THREE TRIPS

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:14.856
TO HONG KONG EVERY WEEK JUST PAY

03:12:14.923 --> 03:12:17.292
AN END. TO THAT POINT I'VE BEEN

03:12:17.359 --> 03:12:19.427
SENATOR I IF IF WE WERE TO

03:12:19.494 --> 03:12:20.829
REMEMBER WE ARE WE IT WOULD

03:12:20.896 --> 03:12:21.830
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BE

03:12:21.897 --> 03:12:23.698
PROGRESSIVE IN THAT CASE BECAUSE

03:12:23.765 --> 03:12:25.700
THIS BILL ANTICIPATES DING AWAY.

03:12:25.767 --> 03:12:27.903
ENTIRELY WITH THE STATE SALES

03:12:27.969 --> 03:12:28.870
TAX.

03:12:28.937 --> 03:12:30.872
SO THT THE REGRESSIVE SALES TAX

03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:32.540
THAT WE HAVE AS A MAJOR CHEN

03:12:32.607 --> 03:12:33.108
REVENUE GENERATOR RIGHT NOW

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:38.046
WOULD BE POTENTIALLY REPLACED BY

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:40.081
THAT THAT SORT OF MECHANISM.

03:12:40.148 --> 03:12:41.516
I SEE NO OTHER --

03:12:41.583 --> 03:12:42.584
WE'VE WE'RE ALMOST AT THREE

03:12:42.651 --> 03:12:44.452
O'CLOCK WE HAVE A MOTION BY

03:12:44.519 --> 03:12:47.022
SANDOR STERN.

03:12:47.088 --> 03:12:48.456
YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD

03:12:48.523 --> 03:12:49.691
ANYTHING ELSE I WILL BUY ONE I

03:12:49.758 --> 03:12:51.226
DO WANT TO FAKE I ACTUALLY WANT

03:12:51.293 --> 03:12:52.193
TO SAY THAT --

03:12:52.260 --> 03:12:54.329
I AGREE WITH NEARLY EVERYTHING

03:12:54.396 --> 03:12:56.431
THAT THE AND THE CHAMBER BROUGHT

03:12:56.498 --> 03:12:57.666
UP I THINK THAT THESE ARE ALL

03:12:57.732 --> 03:12:58.900
EVERYTHING YOU BROUGHT UP OUGHT

03:12:58.967 --> 03:13:00.302
TO BE LOOKED AT AND ENGAGE WITH

03:13:00.368 --> 03:13:02.404
AND AND AND RESEARCH AS PART OF

03:13:02.470 --> 03:13:03.538
THIS STUDY.

03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:04.973
AND AS I SAY I'LL REPEAT AGAIN

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.474
WHEN I SAID THE BEGINNING IF IF

03:13:06.541 --> 03:13:08.243
IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT IS JUST

03:13:08.310 --> 03:13:10.011
ON FEASIBLE THAT IT'S UNWORKABLE

03:13:10.078 --> 03:13:10.979
I DON'T WANT TO MOVE FORWARD

03:13:11.046 --> 03:13:11.379
WITH IT --

03:13:11.446 --> 03:13:13.481
AS A AS A AS A MATTER OF POLICY

03:13:13.548 --> 03:13:14.649
AYE BUT I DO THINK THIS OUGHT TO

03:13:14.716 --> 03:13:15.750
BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT AND

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:17.686
WE DOES FROM TIME. TO TO TO JUST

03:13:17.752 --> 03:13:19.454
EXAMINE AND I I I SAY I SEE

03:13:19.521 --> 03:13:21.456
RESPECTFULLY TO MY FRIEND FROM

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:23.658
THE MANUFACTURERS REMEMBER.

03:13:23.725 --> 03:13:27.495
THAT I THAT THE THE WHILE THIS

03:13:27.562 --> 03:13:30.065
MAY REYES BECAUSE GETTING RID OF

03:13:30.131 --> 03:13:31.466
THE SALES TAX --

03:13:31.533 --> 03:13:34.102
IN THE STATE AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:35.337
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THIS THIS

03:13:35.403 --> 03:13:36.871
NOT DISCRIMINATE IS NOT

03:13:36.938 --> 03:13:38.540
DISADVANTAGED.

03:13:38.606 --> 03:13:39.841
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS --

03:13:39.908 --> 03:13:41.076
IF ANYTHING --

03:13:41.142 --> 03:13:42.243
I I THINK WE OUGHT TO FIGURE OUT

03:13:42.310 --> 03:13:43.178
A WAY THAT THIS WOULD HELP

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:44.679
CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES BECAUSE

03:13:44.746 --> 03:13:45.647
OF THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THEM

03:13:45.714 --> 03:13:46.381
ARE.

03:13:46.448 --> 03:13:48.016
OPERATING IN A MORE GREEN WAY

03:13:48.083 --> 03:13:49.451
AND SO I I THINK THAT WE COULD

03:13:49.517 --> 03:13:50.952
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TO TO GET

03:13:51.019 --> 03:13:52.287
GET EVERYONE ON BOARD WITH THIS

03:13:52.354 --> 03:13:53.388
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU'VE

03:13:53.455 --> 03:13:55.323
RAISED ISSUES THAT OUGHT TO BE

03:13:55.390 --> 03:13:56.891
PART OF THE STUDY IN --

03:13:56.958 --> 03:13:58.660
WITH THAT I I RESPECT AS FOR A

03:13:58.727 --> 03:14:00.261
VOTE THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS

03:14:00.328 --> 03:14:01.296
GETTING RID OF THE SALES AND USE

03:14:01.363 --> 03:14:02.897
TAX IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REVENUE

03:14:02.964 --> 03:14:04.199
NEUTRAL MODEL --

03:14:04.265 --> 03:14:06.134
BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY STUDY AND

03:14:06.201 --> 03:14:07.068
IT'S ALL ABOUT FIGURE OUT A WAY

03:14:07.135 --> 03:14:08.303
WHETHER THIS IS FEASIBLE OR NOT

03:14:08.370 --> 03:14:09.704
MOTION BY SENATOR STERN DO YOU

03:14:09.771 --> 03:14:13.842
