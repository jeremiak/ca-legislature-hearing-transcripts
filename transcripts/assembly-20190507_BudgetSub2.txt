BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING SOMEBODY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE -- TODAY WE HAVE. A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A PROGRAMS WAY TO OUR OUR DATA SYSTEM THE C. COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. AS WELL AS OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SCHOOL NUTRITION AND SOME EDUCATION BUDGET PROPOSALS WERE VERY EXPECT SOME OF OUR LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES TO TO POP IN AND GIVE US THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON EDUCATION -- PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THIS YEAR. SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH THE WE WON'T DO THAT BUT ONLY ONE WILL BEGIN WITH. ISSUE NUMBER ONE TO PART OF EDUCATION THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY LET'S THAT BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER. ONE DÃ¢N HANOVER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND SEGMENTS OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. OF INSTEAD OF THE INCREASING THEIR DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS EFFORTS OVER THE PAST DECADE. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THESE EFFORTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER. MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO GAIN INFORMATION ABOUT HOW OTHER STUDENTS PERFORM. ONCE THEY GET TO COLLEGE FOR INTO THE WORK FORCE. CONVERSELY CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT ABLE TO OBSERVE METRICS FOR HOW THEIR STUDENTS. DID DURING THEIR TIMES IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. AS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL STRIVE TO INCREASE STUDENT SUCCESS AND IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO HAVE ACCESS TO DATA THAT CAN HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES. ON A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO PROGRESS THROUGH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND INTO THE WORK FORCE. TO THIS END THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROP ART NAM PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO PLAN FOR AND DEVELOP A CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELEASED TRAILER BILL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DATA SYSTEM. WITH THE GOAL OF EVENTUALLY CONNECTING STUDENT INFORMATION FROM EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDERS K. TWELVE SCHOOLS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS EMPLOYERS. OTHER WORKFORCE ENTITIES AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES. ADDITIONALLY THECREATION OF A CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO OPTIMIZE EXISTING PROGRAMS. ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ON EDUCATION OUTCOMES. FURTHER SUCH A SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO BETTER SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN THE STATE'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS. THE AGENDA PROVIDE THE SUMMARY OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEFORE PROPOSAL. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE LANGUAGE. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TASK A WORK GROUP COMPRISED OF STATE ENTITIES WITH OWNERSHIP OF DATA THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM. WITH DEVELOPING TO REPORTS CONTAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW BEST TO CREATE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST REPORT WILL FOCUS ON BROAD OVERARCHING ISSUES SUCH AS GOALS SYSTEM GOVERNANCE. AN ARCHITECT AND ARCHITECTURE AND DATA PRIVACY. THE SECOND REPORT WILL OUTLINE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MORE SPECIFIC ASPECTS SUCH AS THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. WAYS TO INCREASE DATA QUALITY. ANALYST A PARTNERENTITIES THAT SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE DATA SYSTEM. THE LANGUAGE ALSO CALLS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND REQUEST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO BEGIN DEVELOPING A MEANS OF MATCHING STUDENT RECORDS AT THE TIME A STUDENT APPLIES TO AN INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS WILL COMPLETE ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL STEPS OF A CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM AND ALLOW THE STATE TO ADVANCE ALONG AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS EXCITED TO BEGIN WORK ON THIS PROJECT THAT WILL CONNECT OUR EXISTING DISPARATE DATA SYSTEMS AND PROVIDE US WITH A BETTER LOOK. AT WHAT HELPS OUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. POSTING HOUSE IN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUR OFFICE JUST RELEASED A BRIEF ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE SERGEANT HAS DISTRIBUTED COPIES IT'S TITLED THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET CREATING AN INTEGRATED. EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM. WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT HAVING AN INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM WOULD BE A BIG ASSET FOR CALIFORNIA SUCH A SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES OVER THE YEARS. PAGE SIX OF THE BRIEF -- FIGURE. TO THIS SOME CROSS CUTTING ACROSS A SEGMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE ANSWERED MORE READILY IF OUR EDUCATION DATA SYSTEMS WERE CONNECTED INFORMATION THAT CAN BE. REALLY USEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS EDUCATORS PARENTS AND STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE THE IMPACT OF EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS ON SCHOOL READINESS FOR CHILDREN POST SECONDARY OUTCOMES OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE. PAGES FOR FIVE OF THE BRIEF PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO START WITH THE CORE EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND THEN BUILD INCREMENTALLY FROM THERE. THAT SAID WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE SHARE STAFF CONCERNS RAISED IN YOUR AGENDA ABOUT THE LACK OF REALLY MUCH OF A ROLE AT ALL FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS PROJECT. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE'S ONLY ROLE WOULD BE UP TO APPROPRIATE THE MONEY. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION MAKING THE DECISIONS FROM THERE. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES AN EX DOES NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT. FOR THE STATE TO GO THROUGH THE ESTABLISHED A PLANNING PROCESS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS IT PROJECTS AND GIVEN THE STATE'S A CHECKERED. PAST WITH IT PROJECTS WE THINK IT'S RISKY NOT TO USE THE ESTABLISHED PROCESS THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR WORKGROUPS TO MEET AND DISCUSS WHEN IT INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND WHO SHOULD GOVERN IT. YET THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY COMMISSIONED WORK GROUPS LIKE THESE IN THE PAST. THE SO CALLED SB TWELVE NINETY EIGHT WORK GROUPS WHICH INCLUDED REPRESENTATION FROM THE SEGMENTS HERE AT THIS TABLE DEVELOPS A DETAILED ROAD MAP FOR DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM. ANOTHER WORK GROUP MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE GOVERNED. IN RESPONSE TO THE S. B. TWELVE NINETY EIGHT WORK GROUPS THE LEGISLATURE EVEN PASSED LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE CREATING A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE THE SYSTEM. AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE THE SEGMENTS K. TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS. THAT LEGISLATION WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BUT RATHER THAN STARTING ALL IT OVER AGAIN WITH ANOTHER WORK GROUP AND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR ANOTHER WORK GROUP WE THINK A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LEVERAGE THESE PAST EFFORTS. TO REALLY LEARN WHAT THAT TO REALLY. BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE ALREADY LEARNED AS A STATE. SO PAGE EIGHT OF THE BRIEF. THAT WE PUT TOGETHER LAYS OUT SOME RECOMMENDED STEPS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO MAKE SURE THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCE OF THE SYSTEM OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT HAS A MINIMAL RISK OF FAILURE. AND WE WAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE PROJECT IN THE APPROACH REALLY BUILDS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND THE PAST EFFORTS -- THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN. SO SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ENACT LEGISLATION CREATING A JPA ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WITH SENATE BILL. EIGHT EIGHT FIVE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATION SPECIFY THAT THE GPAS TO INCLUDE THE SEGMENTS -- AS MEMBER AGENCIES SO THE ONES CONTRIBUTED THE DATA AS WELL AS NON SEGMENTAL REPRESENTATION SEARCHES THE ADMINISTRATION AND BIPARTISAN REPRESENTATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN END THIS JPA COMPOSITION IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT AN SP TWELVE NINETY EIGHT WORKGROUP. ALREADY RECOMMENDED. SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATION. AND TELL THE JPA TO BUILD THE STATUS SYSTEM INCREMENTALLY GRADUALLY STARTING WITH THE CORE EDUCATION SEGMENTS. AND THEN BUILDING FROM THERE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATION SPECIFY THE GPA IS TO DEVELOP A CENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM THAT FOLLOWS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES. PLANNING PROCESS FOR STATE IT PROJECTS. FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE. COULD APPROVE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORTH FOR THIS PROJECT EARMARKED FOR THIS PROJECT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEM WOULD BE CHARGED WITH NOTIFYING THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE THROUGH THE BUDGET ACCESS SECTION LETTER PROCESS. WHICH WHICH WHAT IT DOES IS HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTIFY THE JAIL B. C. PRIOR TO ALLOCATE IN ANY ROUND OF FUNDING AND THAT FUNDING IN TURN WOULD BE CONDITION. ON THE GPA HITTING CERTAIN MILESTONES SUCH AS DEVELOPING A MULTI YOUR WORK PLANNED DEVELOPING A BUDGET. DEVELOPING PROTOCOLS IN THEIR INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR DATA PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY. SO AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE PANELISTS CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF DATA SHARING. GOING ON IN THE STATE AND THE LEGISLATURE IT REALLY IS IN A GOOD POSITION NOW TO PULL ALL THE STATE TOGETHER WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOP A DATA SYSTEM. THAT CAN REALLY BE HELPFUL -- IN INFORMING POLICY AND PRACTICE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE CAN HEAR FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS. BERMAN OF EDUCATION AND THE HIRING DEPARTMENT'S. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS IN BECAUSE HONEST AND DIRECTOR OF ANALYSIS MEASUREMENT ACCOUNTABILITY REPORTING DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TO BE PART OF THE PANEL TODAY TO SPEAK ON THE GOVERNOR'S CRADLE TO CAREER PROPOSAL. IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE AN EDUCATION DATA. WORKING IN THIS FIELD -- ESPECIALLY AS OUR K. TWELVE STUDENT LEVEL SYSTEM CAL PADS CELEBRATES ITS TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY. WE ARE AN IDEAL POSITION TO BEGIN THIS WORK TO DEVELOP A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WITH OUR HEART HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM PARTNERS. THE SUPERINTENDENT WANTED ME TO MENTION THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE SUPPORT SYSTEM INTEGRATION TO BETTER SUPPORT STUDENTS. AS WE APPROACH THIS ISSUE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHO NEEDS WHAT INFORMATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE AND AT THAT THE CENTER SHOULD BE HELPING TO FACILITATE A BETTER STUDENT EXPERIENCE. SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN IS VERY SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MAY WANT TO HELP CONNECTS SYSTEMS WHERE IT MAKES SENSE. IN THAT IN THAT REGARD AND IN ITS AND FOLLOWING THE ELLIE OWES -- REMARKS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH MOVING FORWARD. WE CONSIDER THE OPTIONS IN A FACILITATED SETTING WHICH IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OFFERS THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSAL I THINK REFLECTS WHAT THE SEGMENTS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN MEETING SENSE -- SINCE CHRISTMAS TIME ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO HELP FACILITATE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO SHARE DATA. AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE A REPORT ON HOW MANY STUDENTS GO TO COLLEGE. THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS AT DATA THAT WE DO NOT RECEIVE FIVE FROM THE SEGMENTS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PURCHASE FROM THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE. AT A COST OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT REPORT IN PART BECAUSE OF THE JOINT AGREEMENT WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO HELP COVER THE COST. MOVING FORWARD WITH SAID DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS THAT WERE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATEMENTS OF THE GENTLEMAN AT MY TABLE AT THE TABLE HERE. I THINK IT WILL BE ABLE TO AVOID THOSE COSTS NO VOIGTS DESCRIPTION -- TO IT AS DATA SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND RATHER DEPEND ON OUR PARTNERS INSIDE OF THE STATE. THE FIELD IS READY NOW FOR THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM AFTER NEARLY TEN YEARS OF COLLECTING DATA AT THE STUDENT LEVEL FOR THE STATE FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION WE HAVE BETTER DATA QUALITY THEM ON WHAT WE STARTED WITH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN FACT WERE ABLE TO USE OUR STUDENT. LEVEL DATA SYSTEM TO REGISTER STUDENTS TO TAKE OUR STUDENT TESTS ART RATHER ARE OURS GRADE LEVEL TEST SMARTER BALANCED AND TODAY WE PEAKED AT SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS CAN CURRENTLY TAKING THAT TEST AGAIN LEVERAGING THE CAL PAD SYSTEM. I WANT TO MENTION THAT DATA IS ONLY THE QUALITY OF THAT DATE IS ONLY AS GOOD AS HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE DATA SO WITH THE STUDENT LEVEL DATA COLLECTION THAT WE DO. WE'RE GETTING A DIRECTLY FROM DISTRICTS IF WE WERE TO THEN SEND IT OVER TO YET ANOTHER DATA SOURCE YOU MAY LOSE. THE QUALITY OF THE DATA -- BECAUSE IT FOR THE WAY YOU GET FROM THE DATA -- THE MORE -- OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE FOR A FOR A LACK OF TRANSLATION. I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION -- THERE'S THAT THAT THE SERIOUSNESS I THINK FROM ALL THE SEGMENTS ABOUT -- SECURITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING -- AND WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BEST -- UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY LAWS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF STUDENTS THAT ARE AFFORDED UNDER THESE LAWS. WE ALSO MUST BE CONSIDERATE PRESERVING STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DIGNITY IN OUR DATA COLLECTION AND THE SHARING OF THIS DATA. AS STUDENTS MOVE FROM ONE LEVEL TO THE NEXT AND GIVEN THE INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY NOW JOINT P. POPULATES CERTAIN INFORMATION SUCH AS WHERE THEY ARE FOSTER YOU STUDENT OVER THERE HOMELESS STUDENT. ADDITIONALLY THE SHINE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION SUCH AS DISCIPLINE RECORDS MAYBE RELEVANT AT DURING THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION BUT ARE NOT LIKELY NO LONGER RELEVANT AS A STUDENT INTERNS ARE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. I WANTED TO SHIFT TO THE BRIEF DISCUSSION IN THE STAFF REPORT ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION DATA AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. A MAJOR ROLE IN IN THE SENSE THAT -- WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING AND REPORTING AND DATA FOR THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE. AND THESE PROGRAMS OF COURSE ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT AND ARE ANDERSON -- ESSENTIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS AS WELL AS INTERESTING IMPACT OF THESE EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS. BUT UNLIKE THAT K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND ARE AS TO LEVEL DATA SYSTEM AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAM INFORMATION DATA. COLLECTED FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE COLLECTED FROM A MIX OF ELEAZAR AND NON ELEAZAR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE SETTING SUCH AS CENTERS FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES AND LICENSE EXEMPT FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR PROVIDERS. THERE IS NO INDIVIDUALIZED STUDENT DATA -- IDENTIFIER THE THE THE EARLY HEAD SYSTEM LACKS A STUDENT A STUDENT ID -- WHILE THEY'RE ABLE TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON DEMOGRAPHICS FAMILY SIZE AGE OF A CHILD THERE IS NO -- CONSISTENCY FROM PROGRAM TO TO OUR IN PROVIDER TO PROVIDER. SO -- WE ALSO ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THE WORKGROUP INCLUDING OUR EARLY EDUCATION -- DIVISION AS A MEMBER OF THAT WORK GROUP THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON HOW TO DEVELOP A UNIQUE ID AT THE EARLY EDUCATION LEVEL. THAT WE CAN USE THIS DATA FOR PROGRAM MONITORING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TO ENSURE -- EQUITY AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND TRACKING TRENDS IN ADDRESSING KEY POLICY ISSUES SUCH AS DECREASED ACCESS TO CARE AND A QUALITY CARE AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CHILDREN SERVED IN OUR PROGRAMS. SO THAT I'M HAPPY THAT RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- CHRISTMAS MANY OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU FOR TODAY'S HEARING -- THE VISION FOR SUCCESS THAT WE OFTEN REFERENCE CALLS ON OUR SYSTEM TO FOSTER GREATER USE OF DATA THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE THINK IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND THEREFORE WE SUPPORT THE% INCLUSION. OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET CAN SYSTEM OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE COLLECT LOTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA CURRENTLY THE PROPOSAL TALKS ABOUT STUDENT LEVEL DATA SOLE FOCUS MY COMMENTS THERE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- YOU KNOW -- I THINK AN IMPORTANT STARTING POINT FOR THIS CONVERSATION IS WHAT IS OUR GOAL AND COLLECTING DATA AND CONNECTING DATA WE CAN DO IT FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT -- THREE TO MAKE BETTER POLICY. TO ENABLE PRACTITIONERS TO DESIGN INTERVENTIONS THAT BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. BOB AND TO GIVE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES BETTER INFORMATION TO USE WHEN MAKING EDUCATIONAL DECISIONS -- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND CONSISTENT -- EL AL'S RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK WE'LL NEED TO PRIORITIZE ACROSS THOSE BUT I DON'T THINK. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THOSE ESPECIALLY THE THIRD AROUND GIVING -- PRACTITIONERS -- INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN USE TO BETTER DECIDE THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. CURRENTLY WE CONDUCT -- AND COLLECT DATA FROM THE SEVENTY TWO SEVENTY THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. WE COLLECTED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT COURSES TAKEN SERVICES STUDENTS ACCESS STUDENT AWARDS WE ALSO COLLECTED ON FACULTY AND STAFF WE DO SO ANNUALLY AND BY TERM. WE SHARE THAT DATA TODAY WITH A VARIETY OF ENTITIES IN THE RECEIVED DATA FROM A VARIETY OF ENTITIES -- THESE INCLUDE THE OTHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH YOU SEE CSU IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- WE SHARE IT WITH STATE AGENCIES AND WE COLLECT -- MATCHED IT WOULD STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. THAT WE AGGREGATE OUR DATA AND SUBMIT IT TO OTHERS INCLUDING THE INTEGRATED POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION DATA SYSTEM. ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE ALSO PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSED ON RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THESE INCLUDE THE EDUCATION RESULTS PARTNERSHIP OF OUR OWN RP GROUP AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. TYPICALLY THROUGH AMMO USE WITH EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF A PROBLEM CENTER PROBLEM STATEMENTS THAT WE THINK DRIVES THIS CONVERSATION -- THE FIRST STAR CHALLENGES AROUND MANAGEMENT OF DATA -- DATA IDENTIFICATION CLASSIFICATION AND RECONCILIATION ALL OF WHICH WE THINK THAT AND IMPEDES OUR ABILITY CHALLENGES IMPEDE OUR ABILITY -- TO GENERATE INSIGHTS FROM OUR DATA -- THE SECOND IS AROUND SECURITY -- INCLUDING -- THE NEED FOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR DATA ACCESS AND HOW WE MANAGE -- THE PROPER USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA. AND THEN THE TREMENDOUS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOB CONNECTING DATED TODAY WE'VE HAD GOOD SUCCESS IN NEGOTIATING CROSS SEGMENT MENTAL AGREEMENTS ANOTHER AMMO YEARS -- THE THESE GENERALLY FOLLOW MONTHS OF LEGAL NEGOTIATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL WORK. AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO THIS WORK TODAY I THINK THE BENEFITS OF A NEW STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM -- INCLUDE -- THE FACT THAT ACCESS TO DATE IT WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRIORITIES OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS OUR ABILITY TO SHARE DATA -- GENERALLY FOLLOWS A PROCESS BY WHICH WE PRIORITIZE REQUESTS BASED ON OUR GOALS WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE GOALS THAT OTHERS HAVE. I ASSUME OTHER ENTITIES ARE A VALUE ADDING OUR REQUEST FOR DATA BASED ON THEIR OWN PRIORITIES. WE THINK FEWER TRANSACTIONS OF STUDENT LEVEL DATA -- WOULD EASE CONCERNS ABOUT DATA SECURITY RIGHT NOW EACH TIME PEOPLE AND TURNED IT NMO YOU THEIR MATCHING INDIVIDUAL STIRRED LEVEL DATA USING STUDENT IDENTIFIERS WHICH MAKES IT. WHITE CLEAR THAT -- THERE COULD BE SECURITY CONCERNS. ABOUT OBVIOUSLY THE EFFICIENCIES OF HAVING A CENTRAL -- PROCESSOR ENTITY BY WHICH WERE CONNECTING DATA. SO WE THANK YOU THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS -- FOR THE PRIORITY ON THIS THIS YEAR AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. IF YOU -- ED SULLIVAN -- SYSTEM VICE SAID CHANCELLOR PRINCE TO TIONAL RESEARCH ANALYSIS UP FOR THIS ISSUE -- AS MANY OF YOU WERE WEARING TWENTY FIFTEEN THE C. ISSUE LAUNCHED FACE TO OVER GRADUATION INITIATIVE. THE SAME VICIOUS PLANTS CENTERED ON THE ELIMINATION OF EQUITY GAPS. ESTABLISHED AGGRESSIVE DEGREE COMPLETION TARGETS FOR EACH CAMPUS IN THE CSU SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. OUR GOALS WERE BASED IN RICH DATA. AND THE STRATEGIES UNDERTAKEN TO ACHIEVE THEM WERE INFORMED. ARE INFORMED BY AN ONGOING DATA ANALYSIS. ALONG WITH HER SIBLINGS SYSTEMS. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A SYSTEM WE RETUNE ROUTINELY PURSUE-MEMORANDA UNDERSTANDING. WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE WHAT WORK IS BEST APPROACHED IN PHASES. WITH INITIAL FOCUS ON EFFORTS THAT REQUIRE MODEST INVESTMENTS IN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE FLEXIBLE FOR FUTURE EXPANSION. AM SERVE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS THEY NAVIGATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. EXPANDING PROJECTS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE GUIDANCE INITIATIVE IN TRANSCRIPT CALIFORNIA WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS. FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS WHAT BUILDING STRONG FOUNDATION FOR SUBSEQUENT EXPANSION OF LONGITUDINAL DATA. EACH ACADEMIC TERM THE C. ISSUE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR COLLECTS DATA FROM OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. TO MEET EXISTING FEDERAL STATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE DATE INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHIC FINANCIAL ECONOMIC CAN CAMPUS RESOURCE DETAIL. NORM TO TO A COMMON SET OF C. ISSUE STANDARDS. LIKE OUR COLLEAGUES THE C. ISSUE PROVIDES AGGREGATE ADMISSIONS AND READING THIS -- IN DEGREE COMPLETION DATA BY HIGH SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE ALSO PROVIDE PUBLIC FACING ACCESS TO LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES. WHILE THE WORK INVOLVED IN SHARING INSTITUTIONAL DATE IS IMPORTANT IT IS NOT WITHOUT ONGOING CHALLENGE. MATCHING STUDENT RECORDS AS MY AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED -- NORMING -- IN STANDARDIZING VARIABLES IN ENSURING CONSISTENT DATA QUALITY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME A CONTINUOUS INVESTMENTS OF CAMPUS AND SYSTEM LEVELS. INNER SEGMENTAL DATA SIMILARLY WILL REQUIRE ONGOING INVESTMENTS AND TIME AND RESOURCES ADDITIONALLY ABSENTEE UNIVERSAL IDENTIFICATION VALUE THAT EVERY STUDENT. OR CALIFORNIAN HOLDS WE ARE DEPENDENT ON MULTIPLE CRITERIA THE TEMP TO MATCH REPRESENT RECORDS BETWEEN SEGMENT DATES SYSTEMS. FINALLY ISSUES SURROUNDING DATA SECURITY IN DATA PROVINCE PRIVACY ARE CONSTANT AREA FOCUS. AND INVESTMENT REQUIRING CONTINUOUS ADAPTATION. OF ARTS OF BUYER STAFF. FOR ALL THESE REASONS SEE ISSUES SUPPORT OF A OF A STAGED APPROACH TO BUILDING A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM FIRST BUILDING ON EXISTING FILES AND STRUCTURES. WHICH WERE UTILIZED UNDERSEA PACK -- AS WELL AS THOSE EXISTING -- IN OTHER PROJECTS SUCH AS C. GI -- THAT DIRECTLY BENEFIT STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS. AND THEN EXPANDING OVER TIME TO PROVISION DATA TO INFORM POLICY RESEARCH. THE STAGE APPROACH ALL PRO CHOICE ALSO. ALLOWS APPROPRIATE TIME AND ATTENTION BE GIVEN TO ISSUES OF PRIVACY DATA SECURITY AND DATA GOVERNANCE. AS WE SEE FROM SUCCESSES IN OTHER STATES LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS HOLD GREAT POWER AND PROMISE TO IN HELPING ADDRESS% CHRONIC EDUCATIONAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL CHALLENGES. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE ARE NOT STARTING FROM SCRATCH. WE HAVE STRONG EXISTING DATA SHARING RELATIONSHIPS ON WHICH TO BUILD. AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS TOPIC -- FORWARD -- AND AM HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT.% THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M CHARLES MASTER FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PLANNING AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE UNIVERSITY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF A STATE WIDE LONGITUDINAL DATABASE WE UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION. ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT TO CONSIDER IS HOW TO ENSURE STUDENT PRIVACY. THIS APPLIES TO BOTH THE DATA SYSTEM ITSELF ALONG WITH HOW THE INFORMATION IS SHARED. PULLING FROM FOR A WE PROPOSED LANGUAGE FOR THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ON HOW TO MAKE STUDENT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS MARKS WITH THE WE ALSO THINK THAT IF THE STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA PROJECT WILL BE SHARED WITH RESEARCHERS. A GOOD METHOD IS TO CREATE A PUBLIC USE VERSION OF DE IDENTIFIED RESEARCH DATA WITH OPEN ACCESS. WE CAN TALK ABOUT MORE THAT IF YOU'RE IF INTERESTED. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WE HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THE HELPED US SUCCEED. FIRST OF THE KNOW THE PRIMARY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ANSWER. THEN START WITH A SMALLER SMALLER PROJECT. A PILOT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ALL THE STEPS OF THE PROJECT. FROM DATA COLLECTION TO INTEGRATION THE SECURITY TO REPORTING. AND THEN ALSO SUCCEEDING WITH THE PILOT GIVES YOU A QUICK WHEN. I KNOW AS WELL AS OTHERS HAVE SAID STRUCTURE IT FROM THE BEGINNING SO YOU CAN EXPAND CONTACT. THE UNIVERSITY IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CALIFORNIA CREATING THE STATE LAUNCHED ON DATABASE. THING WITH THE OTHER SEGMENTS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND ET DE TO DISCUSS AN EARLY PILOT. AND OTHER ASPECTS LIKE EMMA USE. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE VALUABLE TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THE STATE HOWEVER WE CAN. AB ANTHONY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. COLLECTIVELY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL HAS SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO COMMENT -- I THINK IT'S MISTER SULLIVAN -- I THINK YOU GAVE THE MOST HONEST ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE IS IN THE VERY EXPENSIVE. IT'S VERY COMPLEX AND SITTING HERE I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS -- I HOPE WERE COLLECTING EXISTING DATA NOT CREATING NEW DATA OR THAT AGAIN YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU'RE VERY STE PLATFORMS AND HOW WE ACCESS THAT THAT I DON'T KNOW. HOW THAT WOULD BE DONE BUT I'M SURE IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME? AND I'M SURE IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY AND I REALLY. WONDER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS I'M NOT CONVINCED WHERE I SIT. WHAT THIS IS GOING TO INFORM? HEY. I'M JUST NOT AT THIS POINT -- AND I LOOK AT OTHER DATA SYSTEMS WE'VE COLLECTED TAKE THE ASPECT HAS RIGHT VERY. IN OUR NEVER MATURED TO THE PRODUCT THAT WE WE CONTEMPLATED -- AS LAID OUT IN THE ORIGINAL CODE SECTION IT'S TODAY IT'S A TEST NOT AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE LEGISLATURE GAVE SOME MONEY. THEY CREATED SOMETHING CREATED CONSORTIUM [inaudible] AND IT NOW IS IS IS SUB PAR QUITE FRANKLY IT'S NOT TEACHER FRIENDLY RIGHT IT'S NOT THUS IT'S NOT STUDENT FAMILY. IT DOESN'T INFORMACIÃ³N NOT BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S IT'S IT'S A TESTING SYSTEM NOT IN THE SYSTEM SO I USE AN EXAMPLE AND NOW WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE. WE HAD BUILT IN RESISTANCE TO CHANGING ANYTHING FROM THE CONSORTIUM THE ASPECT AND SOURCING EVEN IN THE DEPARTMENT. OF EDUCATION WELL THIS IS MY YOU KNOW MY BABY AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE. CHANGING AND I JUST WORRY THAT YOU KNOW WE BACK UP WE'RE FOR CREATING ANOTHER. SUCH ANIMAL WITH THIS DATA SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE A VARIETY OF PARTNERS AND ARE THEY GOING TO AGREE. ON HOW WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE IT. YOU KNOW DOWN THE TIME MINOR HOW. HOW DATA SHOULD BE SPELLED OUT AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME TOGETHER ONCE IS STARTED WE CREATE AND HAVE TO MEET? EVEN AFTER THAT WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES BECAUSE YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TO COMMUNICATE -- SO I'M JUST SKEPTICAL BECAUSE MORE THAT WERE GONNA DUMP A LOT OF MONEY INTO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY COMPLEX. SO I APPRECIATE ACTUALLY THE BOTH THE HIGHER EDUCATION -- BOTH YOU GENERAL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION YOU YOU DIDN'T REALLY SAID WHICH IS CERTAINLY HEADED AT THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ANIMAL. AND PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO LOVE TO CREATE THINGS. AND YOU KNOW THROUGH A LOT OF MONEY MAYBE SOMEONE TIME MONEY AT SOMETHING LIKE THE S. BACK RIGHT. AND THEN LATER ON WELL HEY THERE IT IS IN A RESERVE SYSTEMS THERE IS BUT IT NEVER MATURE TO THE PRODUCT THAT WE'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. SO THAT'S MY FEAR THAT THIS IS JUST TEN MILLION MAYBE ONCE BUT A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF YEARS. TO CREATE SUCH A SYSTEM WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SOMEONE MERA MEDINA. OF I ALSO SHARE A MY COLLEAGUES SKEPTICISM AN INTERESTING ENOUGH WE'RE BOTH TEACHERS YOU KNOW WE'RE BOTH. TEACHERS WHO HAVE -- NO SPENT PRETTY MUCH ARE HOLD WORKING LIVES -- IN THE CLASSROOM. AND I AM VERY ALSO KINDA CONFUSE ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- YOU KNOW HOW. WHAT INFORMATION WE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET IN AND CHAIRED THE THE SKEPTICISM -- MISTER O'DONNELL ON THE VALUE OF IT -- AND ALSO SHARE HIS SKEPTICISM ON THE TRACK RECORD OF CALIFORNIA IN AS SOME OF YOU ALLUDED -- TO IN THE AREA OF IT AND I WOULD GO BACK TO OUR LAST HEARING. A LAST WEEK WHEN WE LOOKED AT ON OUR AGENDA. YOU SEE. TAKING THE ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS A BIG ENTERPRISE OF OF OF CONSOLIDATING PAY AND I KNOW THESE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND BUT THAT WAS IN I WILL REMIND THIS GROUP IS I DID. LAST WEEK THAT THAT WAS SEEN AS A COST SAVING. AND THE COST. MR DONALD THE COST OF THAT WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO US A FEW YEARS BACK. AS A COST SAVING YOU KNOW IS. TREMENDOUSLY OVER BUDGET. NOT SAVING ANY MONEY SO I I AGREE THAT OUR TRACK RECORD ON BIG PROJECTS HASN'T BEEN TOO GOOD. MAYBE THOUGH I COULD GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER UNDERSTANDING FROM EVERYONE HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF DATA IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. YOU KNOW I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL TO OF PUTTING A NUMBER ON ON A CHILD [inaudible] AT AT EIGHT ZERO TO THREE AND FOLLOWING THEM ALONG. ALL THE WAY TO COLLEGE THAT'S JUST ME. YOU KNOW AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I SEE THE VALUE OF DOING THAT -- AS SOMEONE EXPERIENCE AND IN EDUCATION SO I I WOULD NEED A LOT OF CLARIFICATION I HOPE THAT I COULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. THIS MORNING. THEN MAYBE I CAN START. SO SO PERHAPS AS AS AS AN APPROACH HERE AND IT'S SORT OF SORT OF HELLO I THINK A AFTER OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INTERSECTION OF GROUPS. I MAYBE OF LANDED IN A PLACE. WHERE THERE'S REALLY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THE LONGITUDINAL DATA SAID? THERE'S AN OPERATIONAL PIECE. WHICH IS TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. YOU CAN THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEEDING DATA FOR PLACEMENT THAT HAS TO COME UP OUT OF THE CD RECORDS. THAT THERE'S MAYBE A BETTER WAY TO FACILITATE ADMISSIONS TO BOTH UNIVERSITIES. OR ALL -- THREE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WELL FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE LOOKING TO GO ON TO COLLEGE. SO THERE'S AN OPERATIONAL PIECE AND I THINK THAT PEACE IS EASIER TO TO MAKE A CASE. FOR I THINK THE RESEARCH AND POLICY PIECES OF FAR MORE COMPLEX PIECE AS AS A SERVICE. BUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE AND AND OTHERS. IN TERMS OF OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET FOR WHAT PURPOSE. AND THAT I THINK STILL REMAINS A LITTLE MORE OPEN ENDED IN TERMS OF WEAR MAKE UP. AND I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF OF K. TWELVE AND ESPECIALLY AT WE WE KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS GRADUATE FROM WHICH CLASSES WE KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC -- MAKE UP THE PROGRAMS THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AFTER WE LEAVE. AFTER THEY LEAVE OUR SCHOOLS AND IF WE WERE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE STUDENTS AFTER THE OF OUR SCHOOLS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ENROLLED IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEY PERSISTED. AND THEY GRADUATED OR IF THEY DIDN'T IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT PAST THAT FIRST SEMESTER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT OR THAT ARE BEING -- SPOT -- LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS FIVE AND A MILLION DOLLARS TO A PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN LIEU OF COLLECTING THAT DATA -- EXCHANGING THAT DATA WITH ARE MY COLLEAGUES AT THE TABLE THERE'S A VOID OUT THERE. AND IT MOST EVERY OTHER STATE. NO THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE EXISTING SYSTEMS IN WHICH THEY'RE CONNECTED ON A ON A TWO WEEK CONNECTIONS. PIECE RIGHT NOW WITH -- WITH THEIR INSTITUTES OF HIGHER EDUCATION BECAUSE WE HAVE A BLACK THAT -- WE HAVE WE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TALK ABOUT COLLEGE GOING RATES WITH ANY. YOU KNOW ANY CERTAINTY -- WE HAVE WE HAVE A ROBUST DATA SYSTEM FOR K.. TWELVE CALLED CAL PATS AND THAT'S BEEN A TEN YEAR INVESTMENT ARE LONGER NOW BY BY THIS BY THIS BODY -- THAT HAS -- ALLOWED US TO COME UP WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE SUSPENDED AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ABLE TO TELL US MAYBE SINCE SUSPEND STUDENTS FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF CYST OF OF DISCIPLINARY POLICY. SO THERE'S BEEN A YOU KNOW A RICHNESS THAT HAS COME OUT OF THE INCREASE QUALITY OF THE DATA COLLECTION YOU SEE AND AND AND USING THE SUSPENSION ANALOGY WE SEE WE'VE SEEN A DECREASE OVER THE LAST -- SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS WITH COLLECTED THAT DATA SO AS THESE SYSTEMS HAVE BECOME MORE -- MORE MORE STAB WISHED ME NO MORE HOW TO TO SHOULD HAVE BETTER DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WE ARE MEETING ON A MONTHLY BASIS WITH AGAIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND I THINK THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW ON TRACK TO TO MEET -- THE DEADLINES THAT ARE HERE THAT ARE LAID OUT -- IN THIS -- PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE SOMETHING ESTABLISHED BY BY DECEMBER -- I'M I'M CONFIDENT MY TO BETTER POSITION WE HAVE BEEN -- OVER THE LAST DECADE. IF I COULD ASK A QUESTION. AND I AM A PRETTY CONFUSED. I I I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT DISCIPLINE -- AND NOT HAVING DISCIPLINE SHARED SO HOW SPECIFIC YOU KNOW DO WE REALLY NEED SPECIFIC INFORMATION. RIGHT WITH THE DATA REALLY GO. SPECIFICALLY TO A STUDENT. THAT'S A QUESTION. YES I WOULD GO SPECIFICALLY TO STUDENT BUT IN MY REMARKS TODAY. SURE THERE DISCIPLINE RECORD MIGHT BE. ON NOW THERE WOULD BE A RECORD NO I I WAS I WAS USING THE ANALOGY FOR THE DISCIPLINE RECORDS TO US TO SHOW YOU HOW THE DATA QUALITY HAS -- INCREASED OVER TIME AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THE CONFIDENCE IN DATA SYSTEMS RIGHT SO I WOULD SAY THE CONFIDENCE AND DATA SYSTEMS HAS INCREASED OVER TIME AT LEAST AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL. BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S APPROPRIATE TO SHARE WITH HIGHER EDUCATION DISCIPLINES AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I USED AS WHAT NOT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT. THE STUDENT WAS SUSPENDED IN FIRST GRADE AT THAT. THAT KEEPS FOLLOWING THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR VARIOUS YEARS FIVE BUT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I HAVE. WOOD IS STUDENTS. WITH WITH THIS DATA HAVE THAT NOW. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. HAS A VALUE IN THAT AT ALL I MEAN YOU KNOW THAT'S INFORMATION THAT'S GOOD FOR SCHOOL. BUT I DON'T THINK THE STATE NEEDS THAT INFORMATION. THE DISCIPLINE INFORMATION RIGHT OKAY. BUT BUT YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY AND WE WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING THAT FOR THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS OUT. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE STUDENT IS WHAT I'M ASKING CORRECT AND BY THAT INFORMATION ALSO ABLE TO TALK ABOUT TRENDS AT THE STATE LEVEL HOW MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES. WHO ARE ALSO IN THE SPECIAL ED PROGRAM BE SUSPENDED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THEIR PEERS SO THAT IS INFORMATION THAT WE'RE ABLE -- TO TO LEVERAGE IN THE SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THAT THAT STUDENT LEVEL DATA COLLECTION ABSENT THAT SOON DOUBLE DATA COLLECTION I COULD NOT GIVE YOU THOSE KINDS OF STATISTICS. OKAY DID YOU WANNA RESPOND TO THAT I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON HERE YEAH. AT THE END. JUST TO GIVE YOU A CONCRETE EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION NUMBER YEARS AGO. TO REFORM THE STREAMLINED TRANSFER PATHWAYS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SO SHE TO REFER TRANSFER. SO AFTER AND THAT THE PURPOSE WAS TO WAS TO GET IT SO THAT STUDENTS GOING FOR MAKE ME COLLEGE TO CSU TO GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE ARE TAKING. SIEU UNITS AS POSSIBLE TO GET THAT DEGREE THAT THEY'RE NOT TAKING ACCESS UNITS WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN THEY TRANSFERRED TO CSU. COURSES THEY TOOK A COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T. TRANSFER OVER TO ARTICULATE AND IT AND IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS. SO THE LEGISLATURE HAD THIS LEGISLATION OVERHAULED TO CREATE REALLY REFORM THE SYSTEM. BUT TO THIS DAY. YOU DON'T KNOW THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY STE TOTAL UNITS STUDENTS ARE TAKING GOING FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CL STATE UNIVERSITY. WOULD ASK. CAL STATE UNIVERSITY YOU'RE AT T. STUDENTS YOUR SURGERY FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS VERSUS YOUR REGULAR TRANSFER STUDENTS HOW MANY TOTAL UNITS OF THE ACCUMULATED COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND CSU. THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WITHOUT DOING SOME SPECIAL DAIS SHARING AGREEMENT WHICH IS QUITE CUMBERSOME AND THEY CAN'T TELL YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEM AND IT'S DIFFERENT SILOS. FROM THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DATA SYSTEM SO JUST ONE EXAMPLE IF WE WERE TO IT IF THE LEGISLATURE WHERE TO INTEGRATE DATA SYSTEMS YOU'D BE ABLE TO GET A LOT BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT. PATHWAYS FROM STUDENTS FROM ONE SEGMENT TO ANOTHER. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS FROM HIGH SCHOOL SICK MANY COLLEGES WHICH YOU'VE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THAT THAT COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS AS WELL TO DE IDENTIFY LEWIS'S PATHWAY PROGRAM. DOES THIS SEEM LIKE A A GOOD. A GOOD APPROACH AND IT'S A GOOD WAY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND BE READY AND SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE SO JUST A COUPLE EXAMPLES HOPEFULLY IT MAKES A LITTLE MORE CONCRETE. THANK YOU I I THINK THAT THERE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT IS A NEED FOR THIS AND SOME OF A NEW ERA OF COURSE START PRIOR GOVERNOR WASN'T. ALWAYS A BIG FAN OF THESE DATA EFFORTS -- CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT STUDENT SHE MEN AND TRACKING WE HAD A ROBUST THAT DISCUSSED AS FAR AS THE MERITS HERE. ONE THING I'D JUST LIKE TO JUMP ON WITH THE OTHER SAID IS THAT WITHOUT A TERRIBLE TRACK RECORD WITH THESE I. T. PROGRAMS AND SELL. THIS IS A ONE TIME. TEN MILLION CELL IT'S BETTER ONE TIME YOU HAVE TEN MILLIONS NOT WILL SPEND TO HAVE. THIRTY MILLION ON GOING YEAR AFTER YEAR AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FISCAL. THE THE STATE -- PAYROLL PROGRAM OR YOU SEE PATH LIKE YOU DESCRIBE WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE ORACLE THING FROM TWENTY YEARS AGO JUST -- A NIGHTMARE OF THE STATE TACKLING THESE PROJECTS SO I DO HAVE. A LOT OF SKEPTICISM WITH THAT BUT UNDERSTAND THIS IS A ONE TIME. A PROPOSAL HERE WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE -- OPEN AND COME BACK IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO AND MOVE ON TO THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER. CREDENTIALING. AND THE CTC BUDGET. OKAY -- BEFORE WE DO WE DO THAT LET'S GO BACK AND MISTER GALLAGHER WANTED -- TO TO BE HERE FOR THIS RIBBON AT WE'RE GONNA GO TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE THE CAPITAL OUTLAY. WELL FIRST OF ALL IS TO TAKE ROLE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO IF WITH YOUR PERMISSION INVITE -- CAM LEAHY FROM FINANCE TO START FIGHT WITH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR BUDGET. GOOD MORNING CAM LEAHY WITH THE I'M THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TEACHER CREDENTIALS FUND FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT FUNDS. AND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENTS FOR A TOTAL OPERATING BUDGET OF TWENTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COMMISSION IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS FUNDING SUPPORT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AT THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES. TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT FUNDS AVAILABLE OVER TWO YEARS AND ONE ONGOING POSITION FOR THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP. TEACHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL CANADA. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENTS. FOR THE COMMISSION TO UTILIZE GRANT FUNDING PROVIDED BY SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY AS PART OF THE THIRD AND FINAL YEAR GRANT AWARDED. BY THE WALL THIS FOUNDATION. TO COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT INCLUDING A FIELD WORKSHOP AND THREE SMALLER STATEWIDE MEETINGS. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES -- OR PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO A UPDATE THE EXISTING STATUTE GOVERNING TEACHER MISSUS I'M MONITORING. THESE CHANGES WILL REFLECT THE ELIMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY PERFORMANCE INDEX THE ELIMINATION OF THE HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHER REQUIREMENT OF THE FEDERAL NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT. AND TO ALIGN THE DATA SYSTEM WITH THE ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING. THESE ISSUES I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE PERCENT YES THANK YOU. SO I'M PLEASED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON COMMISSION ACTIVITIES AS A CONTEXT FOR THE PROPOSED BUDGET -- FIRST WE'VE HAD THE GREAT GOOD FORTUNE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS TO WORK WITH LINDA DARLING HAMMOND AS THE CHAIR OF OUR COMMISSION -- WE'RE THRILLED TO SEE HER MOVE TO THE STATE BOARD PRESIDENT POSITION AND ALSO QUITE THRILLED -- TO INTRODUCED TO THE PUBLIC DR TINA SLOAN WHO WAS ELECTED FIRE COMMISSION TO SERVICE THE INCOMING CHAIR. SHE IS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF TEACHER EDUCATION AT UC SANTA BARBARA AND IS GOING TO BE QUITE A GOOD LEADER FOR US AS WE AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT -- FOR YEARS -- SO OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND AND REFORMS WITHIN THE COMMISSION. YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN TWENTY ELEVEN THERE WAS A HIGHLY CRITICAL AUDIT OF OUR DISCIPLINE ARE EDUCATOR DISCIPLINE PROCESS -- AND WE HAD WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG IN. TWENTY ELEVEN OF OF CASES THAT WERE PENDING REVIEW BY OUR COMMISSION WE HAVE WE CLEARED THAT BACKLOG IN TWENTY TWELVE AND HAVE BEEN OVERHAULING OUR PROCEDURES EVER SINCE THEN -- THE WE WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR CASES THAT ARE REFERRED TO THEM FOR FURTHER EDUCATION. THE EIJI HAD EXPERIENCED A BACKLOG IN CASES DURING THE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I'M ALSO PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OF WORKLOAD. BACK WALKERS BEEN ELIMINATED WE NOW HAVE A WORKLOAD UNDER WAY -- WITH THEM WE'RE ALL CASES THAT GO TO THEM ARE ARE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE YEAR SO THAT BIG PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN A TOPIC OF MUCH CONVERSATION ANNUALLY AND WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT. WE'VE ALSO OF COURSE BEEN ENGAGED IN OVERHAULING OUR STANDARDS FOR EVERYONE. FOR TEACHERS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS FOR ADMINISTRATORS MOST RECENTLY WE'VE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS SO THE STANDARDS REFORM WORK HAS BEEN BRINGING EVERYTHING INTO ALIGNMENT WITH -- CURRENT THINKING AND FRAMEWORKS AND STANDARDS FOR STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS THAT'S BEEN A BIG PART OF OUR WORK WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR TEACHERS AND FOR ADMINISTRATORS -- THAT GO INTO THAT'S PART OF THEIR PREPARATION PROGRAM LEADING TO A CREDENTIAL THAT WORK WAS FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WERE PLEASE THAT BOTH THE TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND A AN ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT ARE NOW IN FULL OPERATION. WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO TAKING THIS WORK INTO THE AREA OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND BRING IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ON BOARD AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR -- WE'VE ALSO OVER HOLDER ACCREDITATION SYSTEM WHICH IS HOW WE MONITOR QUALITY IN TEACHER PREPARATION AND IN WELL IN ALL EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND THAT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. SHIFTING FROM A DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE ORIENTATION IN THAT WORK TO A FOR PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES OF BASIS FOR THAT WORK. AND THAT HAS ALSO BEEN SIGNIFICANT THAT NEW SYSTEM IS COMING ON LINE THIS YEAR AND IT'S BEEN THERE SOME SOME GREAT -- OUTCOMES OF OF THAT SET OF CHANGES WE'VE ALSO HAD THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ADMINISTER ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN FUNDING FOR TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES -- OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WE EXPECT ALL OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS TO TO PRODUCE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND TEACHERS THAT'S OUR ESTIMATE -- WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FIVE THOUSAND OF THOSE TEACHERS IN THOSE SLOTS -- ARE FUNDED SPECIFICALLY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SO THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR PART OF OUR WORK FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS WELL. WE'VE -- SO THAT SO THAT'S GOOD IN TERMS OF WHAT'S NEXT FOR US -- WE ARE FOCUSING ON IMPLEMENTATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING WHEN YOU ENGAGE IN AS MUCH CHANGES WE'VE ENGAGED AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND ALLOW ALL THOSE CHANGES TO REALLY GET TO THE GROUND LEVEL. OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE THAT WE WORK WITH AND SO WE'RE REALLY ARE TURNING OUR ATTENTION TO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THESE CHANGES ARE BEING AS WELL IMPLEMENTED AS WE NEED THEM TO BE. THAT'S A BIG FOCUS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WE ALSO ARE TAKING A DEEPER LOOK THE COMMISSION WILL BE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AT TEACHER TESTING OVERALL AND LOOKING AT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE TEST TEACHERS. FOR SUBJECT MATTER FOR READING INSTRUCTIONAL CONFIDENCE AT CETERA TO DETERMINE HOW WE MIGHT BRING THOSE SYSTEMS. INTO MAYBE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT WOULD BE A GOOD GOAL -- WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN CREDENTIALING A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WE ARE EXPECTED TO DO MAJOR WORK OF THIS YEAR. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AS THE LEGISLATURE UNDERTAKES ITS MANY PROPOSALS AND LOOKS EQUALITY IN THAT WORK FORCE THE COMMISSION IS PREPARED TO PARTNER WITH WITHOUT WORK. AND AND WORK ON OUR SIDE OF IT WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY THAT WE LICENSE IN THIS FIELD TO WORK IN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. IS PREPARED TO DO THAT WORK TO OUR EXPECTATIONS SO -- WE ALSO OF COURSE HAVE THE FUNDING THAT A KID MENTION TO UPDATE OUR ASSIGNMENT MONITORING WORK AND THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE AUTOMATION PART OF THAT. AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE BILL -- AND THAT THAT BRING ME THE ECHOED IN STATUTE UP -- TO YOU KNOW PART WITH THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SO THAT'S A BROAD OVERVIEW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. ALL NOW OR LATER. THANK YOU LA -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AMY LEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TODAY. THEY BELIEVE OF THE SERGEANTS HANDOUT WHICH 'LL BE SPEAKING FROM DURING MY PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. ONE OF THE ISSUES BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER TO ADOPT A NEW ASSESSMENT INTENDED TO MEASURE WHETHER PERSPECTIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE PREPARED TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM. THIS ASSESSMENT IS CALLED THE TEACHING BEFORE STE TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT ORG THE TVA. STARTING ON PAGE ONE BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. THE TVA IS PERFORMED A PORTFOLIO BASED EXERCISE THAT ASKS PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE EXPECTED OF BEGINNING TEACHERS. THESE TASKS INCLUDE PREPARING LESSONS -- ASSESSING STUDENT LEARNING AND REFLECTING ON PAST INSTRUCTION. THIS SUSSMAN IS INTEGRATED INTO THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS SUCH THAT PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS COMPLETE THE T. P. A. ALONGSIDE THEIR COURSEWORK. PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS SUBMIT THEIR PORTFOLIO OF WRITTEN AND VIDEO RECORDED WORK TO AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR FOR SCORING. THE STATE HAS REQUIRED GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO COMPLETE EIGHTY P. A TOP TEAM THEY'RE TEACHING CREDENTIAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED THIS REQUIREMENT TO IMPROVE TEACHING PREPARATION. BY STAB WISHING CONSISTENCY IN TEACHING ASSESSMENT ACROSS PREPARATION PROGRAMS. NOW IN CONTRAST TO GENERAL EDUCATION SET YOU TAKE STAYS SILENT ON WHETHER SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE REQUIRED TO PASS THE TVA. RATHER START YOU GIVES CTC BROAD DISCRETION OVER OF ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. SEIZE CDC CURRENTLY DOES NOT REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO PASS EIGHTY PA. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. HERE WE COVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES ONE POINT TWO MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR CDC TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT ATP FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THIS FUNDING WOULD COME FROM THE TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT A SPECIAL FUNDS THAT COLLECTS REVENUES FROM FEES PAID BY PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHEN THEY ARE TAKING STATE REQUIRED ASSESSMENTS. CDC ESTIMATES THE TOTAL COST TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TBA TO BE TWO MILLION AND INTENDS TO REQUEST THE REMAINING EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. CDC ANTICIPATES A FOUR YEAR TIMELINE FOR T. PA. DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION THIS YEAR THE CDC WOULD CONTRACT WITH A TEST DEVELOPER TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS WOULD BE DEDICATED -- TO PILOTING THE T. P. AND FEEL TESTS AND BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE NEW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PASS THE T. PAY TO OBTAIN THEIR TEACHING CREDENTIALS. CDC INTENSE THE COST OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY TO BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION GPA WHICH RUNS CURRENTLY. AT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TEST TAKER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ON GOING FROM THE TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT. FOR A WILL WANT A NEW. FULL TIME PERMANENT POSITION TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PA. WITH THE ON TO THE NEXT PAGE.% IN OUR ASSESSMENT WE BELIEVE THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PA A CERTAIN STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS STARTING WITH THE PROPOSAL STRENGTH. FIRST A SPECIAL EDUCATION TO PAY COULD BETTER PREPARE NEW TEACHERS TO ENTER THE CLASSROOM BY ASSESSING WHETHER THEY HAVE THE EXPECTED KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. THIS MAY INCLUDE MANAGING CASES AND PREPARING INTO BY INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THE EXISTING RESEARCH IS LIMITED IF WE FOUND THREE STUDIES GENERALLY SUPPORTING THAT EIGHT THAT HOW IT TEACHER PERFORMS ON THE TVPA CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES. SECOND EIGHT GPA COULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. CDC INTENDS TO ANALYZE THE OUTCOMES OF FROM THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GPA WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE PROGRAMS THIS DATA ANALYSIS WOULD HELP CDC. AS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH PROGRAM WOULD BE. LASTLY WE CONSIDER IF THE PROJECT COST AND FUN SOURCE TO BE REASONABLE CITY SEES COST ESTIMATES FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GPA REFLECTS SOME SAVINGS FROM RE PURPOSING SOME COMPONENTS OF THE GENERAL EDUCATION GPA. IN OTHER WORDS CITIES YOU WILL NOT BE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED FUNDING SOURCE IS SPECIFICALLY INTENDED FOR TESTS OF ELEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF TAX. THE SPECIAL FUND HAS BEEN GROWING IN RECENT YEARS AND IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSALS. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. WE DISCUSSED TO POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES TO THE PROPOSAL FIRST GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WE SPOKE TO COMPLETED THE EXISTING T. PAY CONSIDER THE T. PAY TO BE RATHER TIME INTENSIVE. THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO COMPLETE THE ASSESSMENT WHICH SEEMS RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO HOW HELPFUL THEY CAN BE FOUND THE PREPARATION TOOL. ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER COMPONENTS OF TEACHER PREPARATION SUCH AS COURSE WORK AND STUDENT TEACHING. LASTLY WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE IMPACT EIGHT SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY MIGHT HAVE ON TEACHER SUPPLY. AS YOU WELL NOW THE STATE HAS FACED CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. TEACHERS MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS RELY ON OUT OF STATE RECRUITMENT OR HIRE STAFF WHO DO NOT MEET ALL CREDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. A NEW T. P. REQUIREMENT WOULD AT WORK AND COST TO THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. ALTHOUGH THE ADDITION OF THE T. P. A. MIGHT SEEM MODEST IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE FOR NEW TEACHERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MIGHT ALSO AFFECT THE NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS INTERESTED IN OBTAINING A SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL. MOVING ON TO OUR LAST PAGE. WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PA AND OUT THE EIGHT OFFICE BUT ON BALANCE WE THINK THE PROPOSAL COULD HELP IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION. AND BRING SPECIAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHERS AND LINE WITH THOSE FOR GENERAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CTC TO ASSESS HOW THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GPA MIGHT AFFECT TEACHER SUPPLY BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS WHEN THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. CDC COULD COLLECT INFORMATION DURING THE PILOT PHASES OF IMPLEMENTATION REGARDING. ONE HOW THE T. P. IS AFFECTING INTEREST IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO HOW HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE THE DPA AND HOW THIS AFFECTS OVERALL WORKLOAD. AND THREE WHAT PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS CONSIDERED THE ADDED VALUE OF THE T. PAY AND BETTER PREPARING THEM FOR THE CLASSROOM. THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN USE THIS INFORMATION TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE SPECIAL EDUCATION T. PAY WHAT EFFECT INTEREST WORKLOAD AND COMPLETION RATES AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. LASTLY IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE T. P. AND STUDENT OUTCOMES WERE GENERALLY IT CONSIDER FUNDING AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. THIS WILL HELP INFORM WHETHER REQUIRING THE G. D. P. A. FOR BOTH SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND SPECIAL AND GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF IMPROVING TEACHER PREPARATION AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTION ALL OF SAM BUT FIRST MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND ALL YOU DO -- I'M VERY MUCH A MUCH OF PREPARED IS TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONE TIME AND ONGOING EXPENDITURES THERE IS ONE THING. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE -- THE COMMITTEE -- ADOPT OR LEAST CONTEMPLATE IS -- THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REFLECT READY JONES SAWYER MISTER SAWYER'S JOHN SORES AB. TWELVE NINETEEN WHICH BASICALLY REQUIRES THAT. THE ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA -- ALL CLASSROOMS AND CALIFORNIA HAVE THE APPROPRIATELY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS I KNOW IN SOME INSTANCES I GUESS SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE CLAIMING THAT. THEIR TEACHERS DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE CREDENTIALS. A HIGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING -- IN FACT THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A DEGREE -- SO -- I I WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS -- THE THE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- BE CHANGED TO REFLECT AGAIN -- AB TWELVE NINETEEN WITH THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA AND I'LL ALASKAN VOTE ONE ON SPECIAL EDUCATION IF YOU COULD TELL ME MORE ABOUT. CALIFORNIA IS -- ACCEPTING OUT OF STATE -- SPECIAL ED TEACHERS IN THE HOUSE HOW EASY IS IT FOR THEM TO GET A CALIFORNIA SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL. IF THEIR CREDENTIAL IN ANOTHER STATE. SECOND QUESTION -- THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT VERY RECENTLY PUT OUT -- I THINK A PRIORITY FOR HIM. WHERE HE SAID THAT -- 6% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT ONLY 1% OF THE TEACHERS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. HE ALSO SAID THAT WE'RE I BELIEVE 45% OF THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LATINO ONLY 5% OF THE TEACHERS. ARE LATINO. SO. SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING COMMISSION DOING TO HELP. CHANGE THAT TWO QUESTIONS. SO WITH RESPECT YOUR FIRST QUESTION SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS PREPARED IN OTHER STATES WE HAVE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN ACTION IN THE PAST TO BRING SOME NORMALIZATION TO HOW WE LOOK AT OUT OF STATE PREPARE TEACHERS. BASED ON HOW MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT TEACHER HAS SERVING IN ANOTHER STATE. SO I BELIEVE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION YOU CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG JOSH SPEAKS IS -- ARE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AND MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS -- ANY TEACHER COMES TO CALIFORNIA WITH TWO OR MORE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. IS GRANTED A PRELIMINARY CREDENTIALING GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO GO THROUGH INDUCTION AND CLEAR THAT CREDENTIAL IF THEY NEED -- TO ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THE REQUIRED FOR INDUCTION -- THEY ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE ACCIDENTAL OUT OF STATE. IF YOUR CREDENTIALS OUT OF STATE YOU CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA PRESENT YOUR CREDENTIAL AND RECEIVE A CREDENTIAL IN CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN SERVICE IF THERE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT YOU MAY BE MISSING FOR INSTANCE CALIFORNIA REQUIRES ALL TEACHERS TO BE PREPARED TO TEACH ENGLISH LEARNERS. IN OTHER STATES THAT'S AN ADDED CERTIFICATION. IN SOME CASES A NOT AT ALL SO WE PROVIDE TIME FOR TEACHERS WHILE TEACHING TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT SO THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA MAY BE ADDITIONAL. WORK NEAR MAYBE THERE MAY BE BUT IT'S BEEN FAIRLY LIMITED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN PRIOR. A LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN ACTED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS SO -- WE WE WELCOME TEACHERS FROM OTHER STATES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND 25% OF THE TEACHERS WE CREDENTIAL EVERY YEAR ARE PREPARED IN OTHER STATES SO THAT'S NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT -- POPULATION COMING INTO CALIFORNIA SO. SO AND JOSH SPEAKS FOR MICE. I JUST WANTED -- TO NOTE THAT -- WE ARE. CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. SEE IF THERE ARE UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES WE CAN REMOVE -- AND BASED ON SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD WITH ASSEMBLY AT COMMITTEE STAFF -- IN THE INTERIM -- BEFORE THE SESSION STARTED -- THERE IS ACTUALLY A BILL AB -- NINE EIGHT EIGHT THAT IS -- CO SPONSORED BY -- CO AUTHORED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. THAT -- DOES ELIMINATES SORT OF A AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER THAT WE FOUND IT'S IT'S KIND OF TECHNICAL BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT DOES IS. IF A PERSON COMES IN FROM OUT OF STATE WITH THE GENERIC SPECIALIST CREDENTIAL WHICH CALIFORNIA DOESN'T ISSUE GENERIC CREDENTIALS. WE ISSUE THEM IN SPECIALTY AREAS -- BUT OTHER STATES ISSUE GENERIC CREDENTIALS -- THAT TEACHER GETS. THE APPROPRIATE CALIFORNIA CREDENTIAL THEY YOU KNOW THEY TELL US WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN. AND THEN WHILE THEY'RE TEACHING ON THAT PRELIMINARY CALIFORNIA CREDENTIAL THEY CAN USE -- SERVICE AND CALIFORNIA CLASSROOM UNDER THIS BILL -- TO MEET THE THE SORT OF SPECIALIZATION REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY DIDN'T TURN OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY YOU KNOW WERE ISSUED A GENERIC CREDENTIAL SO AGAIN THAT'S KIND OF A TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT IT'S JUST -- SORT OF EMBLEMATIC OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE. ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE THAT PROCESS. AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF THE TEACHING WORKFORCE -- WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- AND INCREASING NUMBER OF TEACHERS OF COLOR AND ROLLED IN TEACHER PREPARATION -- A PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS OF COLOR LESS THAN 50% OF THE TEACHERS AND ROLLED. IN PREPARATION AND EARNING CREDENTIALS -- SELF IDENTIFY AS WHITE OR ANGLO BACKGROUND NOW I THINK AROUND 30% AND I'LL GET YOU THE SPECIFIC DATA BUT IT'S IT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER -- OF TEACHERS AND ROLLED IN SEEKING CREDENTIALS ARE OF LATINO DESCENT AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO BE OUT WE NEED TO BEEF THAT UP AND AND DO MORE RECRUITMENT AN OUT REACH. TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR THE TEACHING WORKFORCE BUT IT'S AN ONGOING COMMITMENT NOT JUST OF THE COMMISSION'S BUT ALSO OF EVERY TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM IN THE STATE. THEY ARE SEEKING ACTIVELY TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE TEACHING FORCE THE LEGISLATURE ALSO HAS ENACTED AS SOME OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS THE CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE IS GOT A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIVERSE POPULATION. OF CANDIDATES MOVING INTO TEACHING AS A RESULT OF THAT INVESTMENT IN THEIR PREPARATION. SO WHILE WE HAVEN'T YET ACHIEVED ANYTHING LIKE OUR REPRESENTATIVE DIVERSITY IN THE TEACHING FORCE THAT WOULD REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION IT'S TRENDING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT. THIS STATE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO MENTION THE LACK OF OF MEN OF COLOR. IN THE IN THE CLASSROOM AND AND AND I WONDER IF THERE MAY BE ALSO. CONDITIONS IN THE SCHOOLS THAT. EITHER INFLUENCE -- TEACHERS OF COLOR TO STAY IN THE PROFESSION -- AND TO DROP OUT AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE. INTERESTING AND VALUABLE TO LOOK INTO. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR GALLAGHER. SO -- NEAR THE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT I THINK THIS APPROACH IS A GOOD ONE TO KIND. RBC FIRST KIND OF COLLECT SOME DATA SEE HOW THIS IS THIS IS WORKING -- AND AND CERTAINLY WANT TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW -- BETTER PREPARED -- TEACHERS AND TRAIN TEACHERS -- THE THE CONCERN THAT I THAT I MAY HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS [inaudible] AND IT'S A IT'S A VITAL PART OF OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AN AD -- WHAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS IS MAYBE A BARRIER? TO AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK MAYBE COLLECTING THIS DATA TO FIND OUT HIS T. PAY REALLY. IS THAT GOING TO REALLY HELP THEM AS IS GOING TO KEEP OR IS IT GONNA MAY BE A BARRIER TO PEOPLE -- CONTINUING IN THE IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FIELD. BECAUSE WE WE CAN AND DO YOU HAVE SHORTAGES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS -- AND AND SO THAT'S ONE CONCERN THAT I HAVE THE OTHER PART IS IS THE IS THE FEE LIKE I KNOW WE WE INCREASE THE FEE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE TEACHER MISCONDUCT BACKLOG -- NOW THAT WE'VE CLEARED THAT BACKLOG HAS THERE BEEN ANY -- DISCUSSION ABOUT REDUCING THAT FEE. BECAUSE HE OF FEES YOU KNOW THE FEE STRUCTURE COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY BE A BARRIER. TO SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND AND AGAIN I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DOING THIS MAY IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TO BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU SO WHERE WE FIND WITH TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR FIFTEEN YEARS PLUS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TERMS OF WHAT CANDIDATES EXPERIENCE. THE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT ORGANIZES THEIR STUDENT TEACHING. THEY GIVE THEM SOME VERY SPECIFIED TASKS THAT THEY NEED TO COMPLETE WITHIN THEIR STUDENT TEACHING. THAT BECOMES GIVE ME -- MISTER DONALD. WE JUST TAKE A MOTION BUT ON THIS RIVER. YES WE WANT. TO MOVE. THIS - CTC BUDGET ITEM I DO HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AFTER WE VOTE TO APPROVE THE BUDGET BUT ALWAYS HERE. THE MOST IN A SECOND -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY. HI. GROW [inaudible] GALLAGHER. LIMON. MEDINA FOR SEARCHING FOR DONALD. SO I CONTINUE YES OKAY SO IT ORGANIZES THEIR THEIR STUDENT TEACHING SO TEACHERS GOING INTO A TEACHER PREPARATIONPROGRAM. IN GENERAL EXCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS THIS HAS BECOME A CONDITION OF THE PROGRAM THE TEACHERS -- THEY DON'T NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT THIS AS IT'S NOT LIKE THE BAR EXAM IT'S NOT IT HASN'T BECOME THAT IT IS A WAY OF ORGANIZING TEACHER PREPARATION IT'S ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THEY MUST MEET. IN ORDER TO EARN A CREDENTIAL. WE HAVE NOT FOUND THAT IT IS A BARRIER FOR TEACHERS IN THE GENERAL EDUCATION POPULATION WHAT WE FOUND INSTEAD IS THAT IT MOVES FROM THE ABSTRACT LEARNING TO CONCRETE DOING IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE TASKS WE GIVE THEM IT'S TIED TO VERY SPECIFIC PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE FOR TEACHING -- WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY INTERACT WITH LEARNERS SO FOR INSTANCE SOME OF THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE IN OUR TEACHING GENERALIZED TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM A KIND OF OVERALL TEACH THE CONTENT. TWO YOU MUST TEACH CONTENT TO STUDENTS BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT STUDENTS AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING TO THE NEEDS THEY BRING. SO WE REQUIRE THEM IN A TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TO ADAPT THEIR LESSONS PUT TO ENGLISH LEARNERS TO STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TO STUDENTS TO BRING ANY OTHER FRAGILE OR NEED OR OR ASSET TO THE CLASSROOM. SO MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO PLANNING THAT IT TENDS TO BOTH CONTENT AND THE STUDENTS THEIR TEACHING SO WHAT THE T. P. A. DOES. MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ASSESS STUDENT LEARNING AND KNOW WHEN THEIR INSTRUCTION. MET THE MARKING WHEN IT MISSED THE MARK AND WHO WITNESSED THE MARK FOR SO THAT THEY CAN BE TEACHING LEARNING IS IT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF THAT. SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT ELIO RAISED INDICATES THAT IT HAS THAT IMPACT WE DON'T HAVE THE KINDS OF LARGE SCALE STUDIES YET THERE WOULD THAT WE WOULD ANSWER THIS COMPLETELY AND CONCRETELY AND FOREVER MORE. BUT WE HAVE INDICATIONS THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ABSTRACT LEARNING ABOUT TO DOING IS THE KEY THEORY OF ACTION HERE FOR TEACHERS. SO MOVING THIS INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION WILL ORGANIZE THEIR CLINICAL PRACTICE AS WELL WE NEED TO ADAPT IT TO THAT SPACE THE LEARNERS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION BRING A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND. SET OF NEEDS -- AND ASSETS TO THAT ENVIRONMENT ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT SETTINGS IN WHICH THEY ARE THEY'RE TAUGHT SO ADAPTING. THE FRAME OF A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT TO THE TYPES OF SETTINGS OF THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE TEACHING IS WHAT'S NECESSARY. I THINK THAT THE LARGER LIFT FOR IMPLEMENTING THE TVA IS FOR PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ALL ORGANIZED THEIR PROGRAMS IN THIS WAY SO MANY OF THE PREPARATION PROGRAMS HAVE HAD TO RE DESIGN SOME CURRICULUM. REDESIGN HOW THEY SUPPORT STUDENTS AND STUDENT TEACHING. BUT WE IT DOESN'T INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF SPUR OF STUDENT TEACHING. IT'S SIMPLY PUTS IN PLACE AND THINGS THEY MUST DO AND DEMONSTRATE BEFORE THEY CAN COMPLETE THAT. SO MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THIS WILL NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PEOPLE COMING INTO SPECIAL WHAT [inaudible] GEN [inaudible] MY EXPECTATIONS BASED ON FIFTEEN YEARS OF WORK IN PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT IS THAT IT WILL IMPROVE THEIR SKILL SET WHEN THEY GET INTO THE CLASSROOM -- BUT I THINK WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THE THINGS THAT ENABLE OR CONSTRAIN PEOPLE MOVING INTO SPECIAL EDUCATION ESPECIALLY. PRODUCTPERSISTENT SHORTAGE -- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT PREPARATION IS. EVEN IF AMONG THE TOP FIVE REASONS WHY SPECIAL EDUCATORS COME INTO OR STAY IN OR DESIRE TO LEAVE. THEIR ISSUES AROUND WORKING CONDITIONS ARE ISSUES AROUND CASELOADS OTHER KINDS OF YOU KNOW CONTEXT IN WHICH SPECIAL EDUCATION UNFOLDS. THAT WE HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO KIND OF A CROSS AGENCIES AS A STATE -- SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TEACHERS CAN GET THAT JOB DONE THE LEARNERS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. THAT'S THAT'S MY VIEW ON THAT -- IN IN TERMS OF THE FEE. ARE YOU ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THE FEE AND HAVE EARNED REDUCING THE BACKLOG COULD WE WOULD REVISIT THE FEET -- THIS IS THIS RELATES TO OVERALL WE MOVED FROM A FIFTY FIVE DOLLAR TO A SEVENTY DOLLAR TO NOW A HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY FIVE YEARS THAT'S TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR. THE TEACHERS ARE PAYING FOR THEIR LICENSING. AND MY ARGUMENT JUST ON THE GET GO IS THAT THAT'S THAT'S NOT IF THAT'S NOT A LARGE BURDEN FORD FOR TEACHERS FOR A CREDENTIAL FEET. AND THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH DISCIPLINE EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE BACKLOG OUR WORK LOAD IN TEACHER DISCIPLINE AN EDUCATOR DISCIPLINE HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY -- WE AND AT OCT I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU MORE DETAIL ON THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY SUBSTANTIAL BUT THE WORKLOAD ITSELF HAS INCREASED. THE STAFFING NEEDS HAVE INCREASED THE IS A AND THAT ITSELF I MEAN WE ARE ABSORBING A GOOD PORTION OF THE FEE AND SO IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN TERMS OF MANAGE THE WORK GETS REFER TO THEM SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT FEE ITSELF. OF IS IT NEEDS TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SHORTAGES OR TO TO SHIFT THE WAY WE FUND OF THIS WORK -- BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY KIND OF HOW I THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU I WANT TO MOVE TO SOME OF THE ISSUES IN THE AGENDA THAT. THAT WITH -- INVESTED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SOME OF THE PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH THE TEACHER SHORTAGE IN THE PIPELINE AND TALK ABOUT -- OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND WHICH ONES IF ANY WE RECOMMEND TO TO RE UP. IF IF MONIES ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE PAST FEW YEARS PROBABLY BUT THERE STILL MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THESE -- SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT YOU HOW ALL HAVE HAVE -- IMPLEMENTED SO SOME A FAMILIAR WITH -- I WORKED ON WITH YOU ON THE BUDGET LEGISLATION BUT MAYBE JUST RUN THROUGH AND AND GIVE US THAT THE RUN DOWN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK GOING FORWARD WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT SURE. WE HAVE A HANDOUT ON ON THIS I BELIEVE THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATED. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING ONE TWO THREE OF FIVE REALLY FIVE DIFFERENT FOR FIVE DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW IN THE CLASSIFIED -- SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM IS PROBABLY THE OLDEST WE ARE FUNDED FOR THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WE'VE BEEN FUNDED FOR TWO YEARS NOW. FOR A TOTAL OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN TERMS OF DEMAND WE HAD PROPOSALS RECEIVED EVER BOTH CYCLES. WE WE RECEIVED EIGHTY NINE PROPOSALS WE WERE ABLE TO FIND FIFTY THREE OF THEM -- EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED JUST OVER EIGHTY THREE HUNDRED SLOTS WERE REQUESTED FOR CLASSIFIED BY EMPLOYEES TO MOVE INTO THIS PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO FIND -- TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED IN SIXTY SO I WOULD SAY THERE IS THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT THEY USE -- HAS BEEN IN HIGH DEMAND AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S A DEMAND IS IS THERE OF COURSE -- SHOULD BE AT ALL BE CONCERNED THAT THAT. FARRIGHT. TABLE THAT PERCENTAGE OF CREDENTIALED -- PERMITS EARNED IS STILL LOWER IS THAT JUST THE KIND OF WORK IN PROGRESS -- THIS WORK IN PROGRESS LET ME EXPLAIN THAT SO -- FIRST FUNDING THAT CAME TO US IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WENT THROUGH A GRANT PROPOSAL IF THEY RECEIVED THEIR GRANTS BY THE SPRING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THEY AND ROLLED. PEOPLE IN THEIR PROGRAMS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS JUST LAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AT AN A A DEGREE OR HIGHER WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF OF WORK TO GET YOUR BACCALAUREATE DEGREE AND A AND A CREDENTIAL THE THIRD YEAR FOR CREDENTIALS. THAT'S THREE YEARS OF FULL TIME WORK FOR MANY PEOPLE AND CLASSIFIED SEVERAL WORKING FULL TIME. SO THE EARLY YIELD ON THIS WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO THIS PROGRAM AS CLASSIFIED STAFF FORTY HAD A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE. AND COULD MOVE QUICKLY TO GET THEIR CREDENTIALS SO THIS IS THE EARLY LOW HANGING FRUIT IF YOU WILL WITHIN THE PROGRAM -- AND IF WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL. FULLY OF MEET THE IN YOU WILL GET TO THE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED CANDIDATES BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THREE TO FIVE YEARS I WOULD GUESS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME THESE CANDIDATES CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR WORK TO DO FULL TIME STUDY TURN TO BE AN EVENTUAL. AND HOW MANY OF THEM HOW FAR ALONG THEY ALREADY ARE YEAH OKAY. AND HOW ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS SO THE INTEGRATED TEACHER -- GRANT PROGRAM TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROVIDED I ALSO I THINK THAT WAS THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS WELL. OF FORTY ONE PROGRAMS WERE PROVIDED AND SUPPORTED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THEY RECENTLY HAD TWO YEARS AT OF THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO DEVELOP. THESE INTEGRATED PROGRAMS WHERE LIKE CANDIDATE WOULD BE TO COMPLETE THEIR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AND THEIR CREDENTIAL IN FOUR YEARS FOR A GENERAL AT CREDENTIAL OR FORD A HALF YEARS. FOR SPECIAL LIKE CREDENTIAL SO THEY TOOK TWO YEARS OF TIME WITH THESE GRANTS TO DEVELOP THOSE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED THEM AND THEY'VE BEEN ROLLED CANDIDATES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THOSE PROGRAMS THIS YEAR -- TWENTY SEVEN OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. OUR IF WE AND WE DON'T YET KNOW A WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT ENROLLMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF IN ROME AND WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION IN TERMS OF SPACE AND TIME IN RECRUITMENT EFFORT TO GET THERE. BUT IF WE ASSUME THAT ALL FORTY ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IT ROLL THIRTY PEOPLE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED TEACHERS COME THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IF THEY START AS FRESHMEN. IN THESE PROGRAMS -- THANTHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM FIVE YEARS FROM FOUR YEARS TO TO COMPLETING GET THROUGH. BUT WHAT THIS PROGRAM REFLECTS I THINK IS A IS A IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE YOU HAVE. SHIFTED THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR TEACHER PREPARATION INTO THE UNDERGRADUATE SPACE WHICH BRINGS EFFICIENCY WHICH CAPTURES TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW COMING IN THEY WANT TO BE TEACHERS. GIVES THEM A LONGER DEEPER PREPARATION TO DO SO OVER FOUR TO FOUR AND A HALF YEARS SO YOU HAVE INCREASED THE STATE'S. CAPACITY TO BRING PEOPLE IN AT THE FRESHMAN LEVEL AND TRAIN THEM QUICKLY TO GET INTO TEACHING SO -- WE WILL BE REPORTING AND COLLECTING DATA ON WHAT KIND OF ENROLLMENT THEY'RE HAVING -- OVER TIME -- LOCAL SOLUTIONS FUNDING THAT CAME TO US THIS YEAR WE AWARDED FORTY ONE PROPOSALS WE RECEIVE FIFTY SIX PROPOSALS FOR LOCAL SOLUTIONS THIS WAS ALL FOCUSED ON SPECIAL EDUCATION. GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE WHATEVER RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES SEEM TO MAKE THE MOST FOR THEM. IT WAS A HIRING BONUS FOR A FORGIVABLE LOAN OPPORTUNITY OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER SEEM TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GET SPECIAL FULLY CREDENTIALED SPECIAL ED TEACHERS IN -- THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING THIS PROGRAM SHOULD SUPPORT. THE OF THE HIRING OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF AND WE WE FOUND THAT THE FUNDING REQUEST SUCCEEDED WHAT WAS AVAILABLE BY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS -- SO THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AS WELL -- WE WILL BE. LOOKING TO SEE HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE DOING AND WHAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF SERVICE REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS TO GET THESE GRANTS TO STAY FOR I THINK IT WAS A FOR YEARS. THANKS FOR YEARS -- SO. IT'S THIS PROGRAM HAS GREAT POTENTIAL GREAT DEMAND WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT ITS EFFICACY IS AS WE LEARN IT. OKAY AND THEN FINALLY THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAMS -- WE SPLIT THAT UP IN SOME WAYS WE DID SOME CAPACITY BUILDING INITIALLY LAST YEAR WE SHOULD GRANTS WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TO AWARD IN CAPACITY BUILDING TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS. BETWEEN ELEAZAR AND PREPARATION PROGRAMS AND THEN WE MOVED INTO AN OF FUNDS FOR EXISTING RESIDENCES THAT WANTED TO EXPAND. WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY RESIDENCES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE RECEIVED SEVEN PROPOSALS THERE AND WE AWARDED FIVE OF THEM. ONE OF THEM IS FOCUSED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION ON THE THE FUNDS FOR RESIDENCIES FIFTY MILLION WERE SATISFIED FOR SPECIAL LED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SEVEN BI LINGUAL -- SO THE THE LARGEST GRANT PROGRAM THAT THAT WE RAN -- GRANT OUR FEE THAT WE RAN THIS YEAR WAS FOR THE FULL ARE YOU READY TO TO BUILD AND DEVELOP. A RESIDENCY PROGRAM WE RECEIVED FORTY TWO PROPOSALS FOR THAT WE AWARDED THIRTY THREE TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM WERE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. THESE ARE -- WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS FIRST YOU BUILD A RESIDENCY PROGRAM AGAIN THIS IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE. OF OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO WORK WITH A HIGHER IT. PARTNER TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT IS IN DURING BEYOND THESE FUNDING -- OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT IT BECOMES AN ON GOING CAPACITY THAT THE ONLY A HAS. AGAIN THIS HAS A GREAT DEAL OF PROMISE BETWEEN THE THE SPECIAL ED IN STEM FUNDING WE EXPECT THAT THIS COULD FUND UP. TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED RESIDENTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS COMING INTO THE INTO TEACHING SO. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH THESE PROGRAMS AND HAPPY DANCE IN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT TEST. FIRST. YEAH AND AND SO YOU ALREADY DID THE PARTIAL AWARDS FOR THE RESIDENCY BUT NOT ALL.

I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TELL ME TONY THURMOND -- ADD JUST VERBATIM GAVE MY PRESENTATION SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU LA A GOOD MORNING SERRA CORTEZ LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PAGE EIGHTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE WORKLOAD PROPOSALS ASSOCIATE POSITIONS FUNDING AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS OR FOCUS MY COMMENTS TODAY I'M PROPOSALS WHERE. WE HAVE CONCERNS UNDER THE STATE FUNDS HEADER OF OUR TABLE THE SECOND PROPOSAL LISTED -- WE WITHHELD RECOMMENDATION OUR OFFICE WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION TO EVALUATE THIS PROPOSAL. ON THE FIRST PROPOSAL LISTED UNDER THE STATE'S FUNDS IS RICK WITH REGARD TO TWELVE POSITIONS FOR THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION. OF THE TWELVE POSITIONS NINER FOR EXISTING WORKLOAD AND THREE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW WORKING LOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET -- WITH REGARDS TO THE NINE POSITIONS FOR EXISTING WORKLOAD THREE OF THE PERMANENT POSITIONS ARE TO INCREASE FOR THE FREQUENCY OF CD EASE TITLE FIVE COME -- COMPLIANCE REVIEWS A STATE REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT CD EACH CONDUCT ON SITE REVIEWS ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AND CD INDICATES THAT THEY'RE CONDUCTING REVIEWS ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. SINCE THIS COMPLIANCE ROUTE IS A STATE REQUIREMENT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME DISCRETION HERE -- TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF A REVIEW FOR TITLE FIVE COMPLIANCE -- IN CONSIDERING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF REVIEW THEY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE TITLE -- THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME PROVIDERS ARE EXPECTED ANNUALLY FOR TITLE TWENTY TWO COMPLIANCE THAT'S OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AND SOME TITLE FIVE PROVIDERS ALSO A ROUTE. RECEIVE PERIODIC REVIEWS THROUGH THE QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM STAND -- QUALITY READY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM ARE KNOWN AS Q. R. S.. OTHERS FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF FISCAL COMPLIANCE REVIEWS OF FOR EACH CONTRACTOR AT LEAST ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS -- CD HE CLAIMS POSITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL CALLED FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS -- OUR WITH OUR REVIEW OF FEDERAL RULES DO NOT REQUIRE MONITORING OF EVERY CONTRACTOR ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS INSTEAD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THE STATE TO CALCULATE AND IMPROPER PAYMENT RATE -- ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS FROM A SAMPLE OF PROVIDERS -- SINCE THE STATE IS MEETING THIS REQUIREMENT AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH OF THE ROLE OF THAT THE REQUIRED FEDERALTHRESHOLD FOR IMPROPER PAYMENTS ARE WE RECOMMEND REJECTING IS FOUR POSITIONS -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A ONE POSITION FOR TO PROVIDE A RIGHT UP TO COORDINATE REGULATORY EFFORTS WITHIN THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION. CD CLAIMS THAT A TITLE FIVE REGULATIONS FOR EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND MANY REGULATIONS NOW CONTRADICTS STATE LAWS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICES THAT NO OTHER DIVISIONS HAVE WITHIN CD HAVE STAFF SPECIFICALLY DEVOTED FOR THIS REGULATORY WORK -- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS POSITION AND MAINTAINING THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF HAVING EXISTING PROGRAM STAFF CONDUCT THE REGULATORY WORKLOAD -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS UP WITH THAT THE STEP FUNDING THIS NEW POSITION FOR THIS PURPOSE PURPOSE WITH THAT POOR PRECEDENT IMPLICITLY SIGNALING THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE ALLOWED TO LET REGULATIONS BECOME OUTDATED AND EVEN FISCALLY REWARDED IN SUCH A CASE -- THEY DO HAVE ONE POSITION FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT POSITION -- THERE WAS A PORTENT PROGRAMMED JUDGES. DEVELOPED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITHOUT PROPOSAL -- WITH REGARDS TO THE THREE POSITIONS FOR CURRENT WORKLOAD -- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR SOME OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNOR -- INCLUDED IN HIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND WAITING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAIT TO MAKE THE STAFFING DECISIONS AS THESE PROGRAMS ARE STILL BEING DEVELOPED. AND PUT AND ALIGN STAFF. TO ON THE NECESSARY PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE FOR PROGRAM -- WOULD BE COME MORE COMPLEX IT MAY NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF -- SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO HELP DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF STAFF. TO APPROVE WE ALSO KNOW THAT EXPLANATIONS AND SOME OF THE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN CHANGING A MAKING OF VALUE IN THESE PROPOSALS -- IT DIFFICULT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THE ADMIT THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE SOME FINAL DECISIONS. ABOUT WHAT IT WANTS TO REQUEST THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS MR GALLAGHER -- SO COUPLE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AND ACTUALLY YOU PLAN TO USE YOUR CHAIRMAN THE THE MONEY THAT'S THERE TO HELP WITH -- WAIVERS THE DISTRICTS MIGHT SUBMIT WHEN THEY WERE EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION -- PURSUANT TO NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EMERGENCIES SEE OBVIOUSLY WITH WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH -- IN BUTTE COUNTY -- THAT YOU KNOW AND THAT'S IMPORTANT IN A GLAD TO SEE THAT IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET -- THE OTHER THE OTHER ITEM THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS -- THE TWO POSITIONS FOR SEATED EGG. AS TO OUR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HOPING TO CARRY OUT THE CT PROGRAMS BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY IN THERE IS IS THE REQUIREMENT -- THAT THEY USE PERKINS ACT THAT CD USES PERKINS ACT FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SIX FULL TIME REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL -- SUPERVISOR POSITIONS -- THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING WE BROUGHT UP. FOR US. I THINK ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW -- ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THOSE AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THE FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW HOW WELL THAT PROGRAM DOES AND IN TERMS OF PREPARING -- KIDS ROUTE WITH LEADERSHIP SKILLS -- AND PREPARING -- FOR NEO THE COLLEGE ANOTHER IN IN THE NEXT LEVEL OF EDUCATION WHATEVER THEY GO ON INTO -- AND SO THIS ONLY IF WE REALLY PUSHED ON YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN OUT A CD IS. IS KIND OF SOME TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THOSE PERKINS FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET -- THAT REQUIRES THEM TO USE THE THE PERKINS ACT FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE. THE SIX REGIONAL POSITIONS TO AND WE HAVE FULL COVERAGE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TO HELP SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS -- SO I WOULD. HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS AS FAR AS THIS COMMITTEE ENSURE THAT WE KEEP THAT SAME LANGUAGE OF THE GOVERNOR AS HAS PROVIDED IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET OKAY.

AND PROVIDE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SEE -- THINGS THERE ARE POSITIVE AND THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ANSWER REALLY SHIFTED MY PERSPECTIVE -- ACOSTA AROUND WITH IT SO THAT'S MY WHY I STUCK A STUCK AROUND WITH AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BECAUSE SOMEONE STEPPED UP TO HELP ME. THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES OF MY LIFE AND SO NOW SPENT OVER. FIFTEEN YEARS GIVING BACK -- TO DIFFERENT COMMITTEES HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND NOW BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ENCOURAGE OTHER EDUCATORS WHO I DO THE SAME WORK AS I AND A SPECIFICALLY I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW -- OUR PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE -- WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT OFFER A STEAM SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH -- WE DO CORRECT CHARACTER EDUCATION -- SUCH A SECOND STEP IN -- CHARACTER COUNTS A WE ALSO DO A CODING AND MATH PROGRAMS TO EXPOSE RECOGNIZED STUDENTS TO THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT. AS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROVIDERS -- SUPPORT ME THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND MY FATHER WAS -- BAILEY TO READ OR WRITE AND SO THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY I'VE GIVEN UP THE FIFTEEN UP SEVENTEEN YEARS EXACT OF MY LIFE -- TO OUR WORK WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND MY HOPE IS THAT -- YOU WOULD HELP US TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN A SPECIFICALLY I YES I WAS TALKING TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS THEY SAID IF I EXT MY SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU WERE TO SHUT DOWN ITS DOORS. AND FOR SOME OF THEM THEY SAID -- IPROBABLY -- YOU KNOW BE AT THE PARK HANGING OUT -- ON MY JOIN A GANG -- SOME OF THEM I BE TRYING TO SKATE WITH MY BOYFRIEND GIRLFRIEND I LOVE MY PARENTS AT WORK. AND SO THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER ON A DAILY BASIS MAKE A HUGE IMPACT WITH OUR STUDENTS IN A POSITIVE WAY AND I'M JUST ONE RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF IT PROGRAMS ARE NOW DOING AND SO THIS RESULT THE SHIRT. THAT SAYS I'M IMPACT IS RESULT OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SAVING MY LIFE AND NOW I'M ABLE TO SHARE MY VOICE -- WITH OTHER STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS AS WELL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I'VE BEEN YEAR PROGRAMS YOUR FIRST DANCE OF SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY MY NAME IS JAN DIETRICH COME FROM THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE WHICH IS A STATEWIDE COALITION THAT REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF HALF A MILLION CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT RELY ON PUBLICLY FUNDED AFTER. SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY. I APPRECIATE ALL THE ACADEMIC SUPPORTS AND THAT NAY IT HAS POINTED OUT HERE IMPROVING SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REDUCING DROPOUT RATES HELP. IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS TRANSITION TO PROFICIENCY BILL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS PROMOTE CAREER EXPLORATION ALL WHILE PROVIDING CRITICAL CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN. FOR SOME STUDENTS AS YOUNG AS FIVE YEARS OLD WHETHER PARENTS WORK. CURRENT CURRENTLY STATEWIDE ASUS SERVICE FOURTH THAT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN FOUR THOUSAND SCHOOLS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS AND PRIORITY ENROLLMENT IS GIVEN TO EXPERIENCING TO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OR IN FOSTER CARE. I WISH WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION STUDENTS THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IF ONE WERE AVAILABLE. ESPECIALLY THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LOW INCOME ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS. THAT DON'T OFFER AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AT ALL. ADDING SLOTS IS A REAL NEED BUT WE CAN'T ASK FOR MORE SLOTS UNTIL THE FOUNDATION OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE FIXED. EACH TIME THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE ASUS PROGRAM SINK DEEPER INTO DEFICIT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE 50% AND FINING PHRASES HAS INCREASED YEARS OF UNDER FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. HAVE CAUSED. THEM TO REDUCE THEIR OFFERINGS THAT HAVE MADE PROGRAM SO SUCCESSFUL. LAKE TUTORING STEM LABS ART CLASS THE LOSING HIGH QUALITY STAFF BECAUSE THEY CAN GET BETTER PAY WITH LESS RESPONSIBILITY IN FAST FOOD. TODAY PROGRAMS ARE STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT AND DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN SURVIVE ANOTHER MINUTE I'M WAGE INCREASE IN JANUARY AS AN EXAMPLE IN BUTTE COUNTY. THEY SERVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED RULE AND IN ISOLATED STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN ASUS FUNDING THEY WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. BUT TO CLOSE THEIR TWENTY FOUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED CASE BUT IT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. NEARLY ONE IN FOUR PROGRAMS ACROSS CALIFORNIAEXPECT EXPECT TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS WOULD LEAVE APPROXIMATELY NINETY ONE FAT NINETY ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES WITH OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR PROVIDES CRITICAL FUNDING THIS YEAR OUR STUDENTS WILL LOSE HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL LEARNING HOURS THAT HELP KEEP. HELP CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT AN OPPORTUNITY GAP. AND OUR FAMILIES WILL LOSE A KEY PIECE OF TO THE CHILD CARE CONTINUE ON THAT HELPS PARENTS KEEP THEIR JOBS WE ASK THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO PLEASE PROVIDE. THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION TO KEEP BASIS PROGRAMS OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU -- I HAVE SOME SOME QUESTIONS TO CAN YOU GO OVER AGAIN THE IMPACT ON THE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THE PROGRAM AND I KNOW LAST YEAR WE FINALLY GAVE UP BOB. TO YOU AFTER MANY YEARS OF NOT HAVING A COLOR ANY TYPE OF ADJUSTMENT. HE WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR ENOUGH OF A DECADE SO LAST WEEK AT A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. INCREASE BUT HOW DOES THAT PLAY OUT AS FAR AS THE REAL COST AND MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN LABOR COSTS AND SO FORTH ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. I'M IT SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS THE FIRST INCREASE IN ASUS AND IN OVER A DECADE. AT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS THE HAVE ANALYZED FINDING. EACH TIME THAT MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES A DOLLAR ACES PROGRAMS NEED ABOUT FIFTY CENTS MORE PER pWHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE -- AND SO CURRENTLY PROGRAMS ARE FIND EIGHT EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETEEN CENTS PER STUDENT PER DAY. IT CAME UP FROM SEVEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS PER STUDENT PER DAY SO. AS MUCH AS WE WERE ABLE TO GAIN FROM THAT FINDING INCREASE BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT IS NOW LOST EACH TIME THE MINIMUM WAGE CAN HAD CONTINUES TO GO OUT OKAY. AND AND THEN -- SO THERE THE REQUEST -- THIS YEAR IS -- IS THE AMOUNT YOUR CALL AMOUNTS THE THE REQUEST THIS YEAR IS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION. THAT'S TO THAT TAKES AN ACCOUNT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES FROM TWENTY IN THE LARGEST ONES FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TELL TODAY -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING -- WITH A SEVEN MEMBER CREO TO ALSO PROVIDE A COLA -- IN FUTURE YEARS GROWTH SO WE DO NOT KEEP COMING BACK WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND ASK COST OF LIVING. CONTINUES TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS WE WE DON'T KEEP CREATING THE SAME PROBLEM. YEAH I I THINK IT'S IT'S FAIR WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR I JUST AS PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STATE BUDGET ARE. CERTAINLY -- PROPERLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS WE RECOGNIZED THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PAY OUR OUR WORKERS IN THIS FIELD -- WAGES AREN'T POVERTY WAGES AND THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT DOING SO HAS AN IMPACT AND JUST SIMPLE MATHEMATICS SO THAT IF THOSE WAGES GO UP. FEAR STUDENTS SO WILL BE SERVED SO. IF THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE ON THE LINE THE LOSS OF PROGRAMS THE STUDENTS AGAIN. SO WE ARE ESTIMATING -- BASED ON OUR STATEWIDE SURVEY NEARLY ONE IN FOUR PROGRAMS EXPECT TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS ACROSS THE STATE. WITHOUT FINDING BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND SAID THAT WOULD IMPACT ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD LOSE THEIR THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. AND WE KNOW THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE THESE HE'S PROGRAMS ARE IN HERE IN OUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY A LITTLE BIT THERE. IN A VIABLE FOR WORKING. PARENTS BUT ALSO AS YOU SAID -- KEEP KIDS OUT OF TROUBLE YOU KNOW THE POLICE CHIEFS ALWAYS SAY BETWEEN THREE AND SIX IS PRIME TIME FOR JUVENILE CRIME AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS ABOUT SAYING IT ALL GO AND COMMIT -- THAT STUFF BUT YOU KNOW KIDS BE KIDS SOMETIMES AND SO HAVING THESE PROGRAMS. BETWEEN THREE AND SIX ARE ARE ARE CRITICAL ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE LONG TERM NOT JUST GENERAL FUND IS THAT. WE PUT ON THE BALLOT TWO YEARS AGO PROP SIXTY FOUR TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA AND WE SAID THREE THINGS WE SHOULD TAX IT REGULATED. AND USE THE REVENUES FOR PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO LITERALLY WAS ON THE TV COMMERCIAL. IT WAS ON THE MAILERS TO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND IT WAS ON THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS AND SO. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HONOR THAT WILL AND THAT MONEY IS NOT -- POURING IN -- JUST YET AND THE FIRST PART OF IT HAS TO GO TO TO PAY FOR SOME OTHER -- COMMITMENTS AS FAR AS THE BALLOT MEASURE BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HOLD ITS ON THAT ISSUE THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT OF IDEAS HOW TO SPEND THAT MONEY. BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT WE KNOW MAKES SENSE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY. WAS A COMMITMENT TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. SO MISTER GALLAGHER. YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY I MEAN -- THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN HOW VITAL THEY ARE -- IN A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS I'VE SEEN IT FIRST HAND UP IN -- IN THE IN THE BUTTE COUNTY -- WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF THE NORTH VALLEY HAVE THEIR AND AND AND AND IN FACT YOU IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE. WHERE WE HAD -- THEY HAD A THEY HAD SEVERAL -- PROGRAMS UP THERE ON THE RIDGE. THIS YEAR THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE I CAME THAT SECOND HOME -- FOR A LOT OF THOSE KIDS WHO WERE. THE OBVIOUS HE HAD LOST THEIR HOME HAD BEEN TO A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND WAS THE PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GET. SOME NORMALCY -- SO WE REALLY SAW. I MEAN WE ALREADY SEE THE VALUE BUT I I MEAN LIKE WAS LIKE ESPECIALLY HIGHLIGHTED -- AS I WAS WORKING WITH THEM. WITH THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB IN AND THEY'VE GOT A GREAT STAFF OVER THERE -- YOU KNOW AS I'M AS I'M SHARED IT AS YOURS IS HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- AND SO -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO THE WE'RE NOW I'D I HAD HEARD I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT BUT THAT THERE WAS MAYBE SOME MONEY THAT HAD GOTTEN RETURNED BACK TO THE STATE BECAUSE IT IS BECAUSE IT WASN'T BEING. UTILIZE LOCALLY OR MAYBE THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT HAVE WE WHERE IS THAT FUNDING NOW AND LIKE FOR PROGRAMS THAT MAYBE DO NEED SOME ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IS THAT SOMETHING WE COULD REPURPOSE -- YOU KNOW -- IN IN IN DIFFERENT AREAS MAYBE MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK. TO YES -- WE HAVE. IN A SCENE I LEGISLATION OUT THERE THAT. TRIES -- TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY WITH THE THESE UNSPENT FUNDS SO WHAT YOU KNOW I WOULD DEFER TO EXPERTS AT CD BUT WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THEM IS THAT. WITH ANY GRANT PROGRAM THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S LEFT ON THE TABLE EACH YEAR FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO EVENTS LIKE MADE YEAR ATTENDANCE CHANGES AND SO. ONE PROGRAM HASN'T COME BACK AND TAKING ALL THE MONEY AS THEY HAD HOPED -- HOWEVER EMAIL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE OF AN UNDER SUBSCRIBE PROGRAM. AND IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COHORT FOR ASUS PROGRAMS APPLICANTS REQUESTED FOUR TIMES AS MUCH -- THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO BE FIND IT SO. THERE IS THERE IS -- I THINK HERE EVERY YEAR A LITTLE BIT LEFT THAT JUST. DUE TO TECHNICAL CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AT THAT. WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW THOSE FUNDS GETS BAND AND WE APPRECIATE. AT THE SENATE MEMBER FROM LOOK FOR LOOKING INTO THAT -- AND HOW TO BEST USE THAT FINDING -- BUT JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY IN TERMS OF OVERALL -- SUBSCRIPTION TO THIS ACCOUNT. WELL THAT'S ONE I MEAN KIND OF SIMILAR. I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN DO THAT HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO HAVE MAYBE SOME UNSUBSCRIBE FUNDS. IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD PROGRAMS THAT I'VE SEEN BEEN IMPACTED BY DISASTER THAT KIND OF SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM. IF THERE WAS THE ABILITY TO MAYBE SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING TO HELP SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT IF MAYBE HAD -- NEO BUT AN EVEN GREATER NEED JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED -- AND SOME OF THE YOU KNOW THE TRAUMA THAT. KIDS IN A BAND COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO -- IN THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE OR I MEAN. AT SHIRT IT'S WE KEEP A RUNNING LIST UP HERE OF ALL OF OUR GOOD IDEAS AND AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ON THE LIST WHAT I I'D LIKE TO JUST -- FOCUS ON THE OVERALL ASUS PROGRAM WHICH RALPH. THESE LEADER NOT SURE ABOUT IT BUT BUT HELP ISSUES IN. URBAN AREAS IF I HOT HIGH COST OF LIVING AND THEY'VE DONE THEY'VE DONE A SECONDARY BALLOT MEASURE FOR MINIMUM WAGE SOME SAN JOSE. SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES ABOUT THEIR OWN SAYS HE HAD BEEN HIRED IN THE STATE. AND SO YOU'RE SEEING YOU KNOW MORE PRESSURE ON THOSE PROGRAMS SOME. I THINK ALL AROUND BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A HIGH PRIORITY. WE TRY THE LAST FEW YEARS IN THE BUDGET TO TO TO INCREASE FOR AFTER SCHOOL -- PROGRAMS AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. OKAY WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ISSUE OFTEN. FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO PROCEEDS WITH -- ISSUE HERE HAVE -- SOME LEGISLATORS ARE LIKE TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL SO THIS IS ON SCHOOL NUTRITION WE'RE GONNA HEAR FIRST FROM DEPARTMENT OF THAT. GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF OUR SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND SOME. BUDGET -- REQUEST RELATE TO SCHOOL MEALS AND NUTRITION. SO FIRST GOING TO BRING UP LISA MEL HOUSE OF DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM -- SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM LEAST AMOUNT HOW SO MANY TRIPS NOTIFICATION ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THIS MORNING TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SCHOOL NUTRITION AND THE WORK THAT WE OVERSEE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ADMINISTERS AND PROVIDES A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO OVER THREE THIRTY THREE HUNDRED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND PROGRAM SPONSORS. THAT OPERATE ONE OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE'S CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS. THES FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO SAFEGUARD THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN AND TO PROVIDE NUTRITIOUS YEAR ROUND ACCESS TO MEALS. THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTERS SEVEN OF THE FEDERAL CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS THE MAIN FOCUS TODAY IS SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES BOTH BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM IN SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM PROVIDES REIMBURSEMENT TO PROGRAM OPERATORS THAT PROVIDE A NUTRITIONALLY BALANCED BREAKFAST OR LUNCH TWO CHILDREN EACH SCHOOL DAY. OF THE SIX POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ENROLLED IN SCHOOLS 60% ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. IN SCHOOL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PROGRAM OPERATORS SERVED OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION LUNCHES. AND OVER TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION BREAKFASTS TO NEEDY CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PROGRAM OPERATORS ARE REIMBURSED FOR MEALS BASED ON THE STUDENTS FREE REDUCED PRICE ARE PAID ELIGIBILITY STATUS. CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES WITH INCOME AT OR BELOW A HUNDRED AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEALS. THOSE WITH INCOMES BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND 31% AND A HUNDRED AND 85% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THE REST ARE CONSIDERED PAID STUDENTS. BARSTOOLSPORTS SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THAT DISTRICTS AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS TO OFFER ALL NEEDY STUDENTS AT LEAST ONE NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE FREE. OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. WE REFER TO THIS A BAR LAW AS A STATE MAIL MANDATE. CALIFORNIA ADD CODE SECTION FOUR NINE FIVE FIVE ZERO REFERS TO THE STATE MIL MANDATE. THE STATE MIL MANDATE WILL EXTEND TO CHARTER SCHOOL STARTING THIS JULY FIRST AND THIS WAS AFTER THE PASSING OF AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE LAST YEAR. THEREFORE ALL MEALS REGARDLESS OF BEING ON THE FEDERAL PROGRAM OR NOT IN CALIFORNIA MUST MEET THE FEDERALLY MANDATED MALE PATTERN REQUIREMENTS. THE MALE PATTERN STANDARDS REFLECT THE MOST CURRENT DIETARY SCIENCE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS AS RECOMMENDED BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. THE MALES MUST FOLLOW THE FOOD BASE MANY PINING OF FOR APPROACH THAT FOCUSES ON FOOD COMPONENTS. FIVE FOOD COMPONENTS NEED TO BE OFFERED FOR REIMBURSABLE LUNCH. FRUIT VEGETABLES GRAINS MEET MEET ALTERNATE AND MILK. THREE FOOD COMPONENTS MUST BE OFFERED FOR REIMBURSABLE BREAKFAST FRUIT GRAINS AND MILK. PLANT BASED OPTIONS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE WITH THE USE OF MEAT ALTERNATIVES THAT INCLUDE NUTS AND SEED BUTTERS. BEANS PEAS AND LEGUMES AND SOY PROTEINS SUCH AS SO YOGURT TOFU AND VEGGIE BURGERS. REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE ESTABLISHED EACH YEAR BY THE USDA. AND FOR THOSE THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR SCHOOL YOU'RE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR LUNCH.

AND AS BOTTOM -- I'M SORRY FONTANA UNIFIED HAD BURKE BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL SO IT WAS MONDAY MORNING I'M WALKING IN AND I'M A STRICT TEACHER AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ON TIME. AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE LATE AND I NOTICED THAT -- THEY WERE YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY SHOWERED AND THE HIDING WASN'T GREAT BUT I SAID YOU KNOW GO GO GO GET YOUR BREAKFAST AND YOU KNOW MEET ME IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE I KNEW. THAT WE HAD BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL AND SO THEY COME IN I TO THE CLASSROOM AND ONE OF THE LITTLE GIRLS SAYS THAT YOU KNOW MIGHT MISS RUBIO MY TUMMY HURTS.

EVERYBODY HAS -- THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE TO TO EAT AND IF I WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT AND KNOWN THAT THE THE SCHOOL PROVIDED -- BREAKFASTS I WOULDN'T OF SAID HAGEL GET YOUR BREAKFAST AND COME BACK -- IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND AS A FORMER TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A A TON OF KIDS. THAT THE ONLY MEAL THAT THEY HAVE ARE ARE IN SCHOOL AND THE BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL -- ALSO PROVIDES THE TEACHERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE KIDS ARE FED AND SOMEONE WE'RE REQUIRING BILLS TEACH THOSE KIDS.

READING MATH AND ARITHMETIC ARE WE WHAT IS IT READING -- READING AND ARITHMETIC RIGHT AND THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

SO SOMEONE OR CREATE WEEK WEEK WE WE FINISHED UP THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM BUT PLEASE COME UP AND SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON INVESTING IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIRTY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I PRESENT TO YOUR COMMITTEE SO -- THANK YOU ONE RULE DON'T MENTION A BILL THIS IS AN IDEA ALL THEY'VE BEEN ADVISED ON AN IDEA. WHAT IS THE BILL WHAT IS THAT ABOUT HOW MANY ASKING? WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM HERE TO TO SPEAK ABOUT. OUR ASUS PROGRAM OF FISCAL EDUCATION -- AND SAFETY PROGRAMS WHICH AS YOU KNOW OUR CORNERSTONES TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PLAY. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACADEMIC ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES THAT IMPROVE THEIR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR PEERS. IN CALIFORNIA THE EIGHTH PROGRAM SERVES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. AT FORTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS ACROSS OUR STATE EVERY DAY. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN ESSENTIAL FOR WORKING PARENTS WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD AFTER SCHOOL CHILD CARE HOWEVER OVER THE TIME COST TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. SINCE ASUS WAS IMPLEMENTED THE CALIFORNIA MINIMUM WAGE HAS INCREASED BY 50%. AND THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX HAS INCREASED BY 30% WHILE THE DAILY REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR ASUS HAS ONLY INCREASED 9%. AS A RESULT THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE FREQUENTLY STRUGGLE TO STAY OPEN. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT FUNDING INCREASES A ONE IN FOUR PROGRAMS IT'S EXPECTED TO CLOSE. THEIR DOORS TO ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS BY. TWENTY TWENTY THIS BUDGET ITEM PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION AND CONTINUE WITH FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THE EDUCATION. FOR THESE CRITICAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THUS BRINGING THE FUNDING FORMULA FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETEEN CENTS TO NINE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. PER STUDENT PER DAY WHICH QUITE FRANKLY IN MY OPINION IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE. WITH THIS APPROPRIATION OUR STATE WILL ALLOW ASUS FUNDING TO GROW WITH FUTURE MINIMUM WAGE AND COST OF LIVING INCREASES TO CONTINUE SERVING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THEIR FAMILIES THIS FUNDING WILL ENSURE THAT THE ASUS PROGRAMS THEY OPEN. PROVIDE NUTRITIOUS MEALS -- NUTRITIOUS MEALS AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TUTORING AN ESSENTIAL EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES TO ALL STUDENTS WHICH INCLUDE MUSIC ARTS STEM PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ALSO LESS YOU KNOW -- BENEFIT THE FUTURE OF THE STATE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU WE HAD A A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND MISTER GALLAGHER TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS A VALUE UP IN -- RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS SACRAMENTO AND URBAN LA AND WE KNOW WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES REALLY SQUEEZE TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SO -- WE WE DID AND INVESTMENT LAST YEAR FIRST TIME EVER. FOR THE ASUS PROGRAM BUT THERE IS A DOLLARS AND GOING AS FAR NUMEROUS WILL ATTEND TO DO SO AGAIN THIS YEAR. THANK YOU WHEN IT COMES TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHICH SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE A CHAMPION OF K. THROUGH TWELVE AFTER SCHOOL. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU COME FROM A INNER CITY URBAN AREA OR RULE DISTRICT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR RESOURCES IN THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE WHICH I THINK. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU COME FROM ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS THE PRIORITY FOR WHO WE ARE. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS WOULD LIKE -- TO JOIN US TALK ABOUT A A TEACHER GRANT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE THE RIGHT RIVAS. WHAT'S THAT IS THIS WHAT DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT RIVAS I HELP YOU DO. WE GO I HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S ON THE ONCE AGAIN I MEAN I WE'RE GONNA SEE WAS A CHAIR AND I AM HERE AT THIS WANTED TO REQUEST FINDING FINDING. NEEDED TO HELP ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN OUR STATE. EARLIER THIS YEAR I SUBMITTED A LETTER REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION OR MORE FOR THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. A BILL I'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL A BILL THAT A YOU KNOW AN EFFORT THAT HE IS CHAMPION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND SO SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AND AND IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVING A VERY VERY TOUGH TIME. RECRUITING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED CREDENTIALED TEACHERS -- THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE AS THE COST OF BECOMING A TEACHER THEY THEY CONTINUE TO RISE AND SAY RECENT COPIES OF SURVEY OF TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. REVEALED THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO FILL THE CLASSROOMS. I IN FACT THE SUPPLY OF NEW TEACHERS IS CURRENTLY HOVERING A TWELVE YEAR LOW. AND ACCORDING TO SOME DATA FROM THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF NEW CALIFORNIA. PREPARED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ON SUB STANDARD CREDENTIALS. IN MATH THE NUMBER OF FULLY PREPARED CANDIDATES WITH PRELIMINARY CREDENTIALS HAS DECREASED BY 50% IN SIX YEARS. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I REQUEST AT THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION THUS CREATING AND FUNDING THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. AND THIS PROGRAM ITSELF -- IT PROPOSES -- TO PROVIDE ONE TIMES -- THE SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP GRANTS OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO CANDIDATES TO COMMIT TO TEACHING FOR FOUR YEARS IN A HIGH NEED SUBJECT AREA THIS INCLUDES BILINGUAL EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION AND STAB SUBJECT MATTERS. AND SO CERTAINLY THIS THIS ALLOCATION IS THIS THIS THIS BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY THREE ONE ENTIRELY SOLVE OUR TEACHER SHORTAGE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WILL CERTAINLY GO A LONG WAY TO HELP CREATE THE INCENTIVES NEEDED TO INCREASE THE PIPELINE OF QUALIFIED TEACHERS IN SUBJECTS SHORTAGE AREAS. WITH THAT. THANK YOU MISTER WE WE HAD A DISCUSSION A LITTLE WHILE AGO WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING TALK ABOUT THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM. AND THAT WE USED TO HAVE A CAL GRANT T. PROGRAM UP FRONT TO GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET YOUR CREDENTIAL WE DO HAVE THE LOAN FORGIVENESS THE APPLE PROGRAMS WHICH IS. AS MAYES DOUBT SO I KNOW MISTER RODRIGUEZ'S IS PURSUING THAT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT -- WE NEED TO HELP GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE CLASSROOM THERE ARE. SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE TEACHING TODAY WITH AN EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL AND NOT GOOD FOR KIDS SO RIGHT. I WAS ON THE LIST FOR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR ALLOWING ME SPEAK THIS MORNING ON BUDGET REQUEST IT RELATES TO EDUCATION FINANCE FIRST ARE TO ACTUALLY I'M SORRY FIRST I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BETTER REQUEST FOR THE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS CREATION PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATION TO THE PROGRAM IN ORDER SUPPORT LOCAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT EFFORTS TO INSTALL COST EFFECTIVE ENERGY PROJECTS. IN TWENTY TWELVE CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROP THIRTY NINE A MEASURE THAT INCREASED STATE REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OVER FIVE YEARS HALF OF THOSE REVENUES WERE ALLOCATED TO PROGRAM FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS OF JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP THIRTY NINE PROJECTS WERE APPROVED A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WITH ANYA ALLOCATIONS AVERAGING THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE FIVE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THESE PROJECTS ARE PROJECTED TO PRODUCE AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION IN ANNUAL ENERGY COST SAVINGS. IN ADDITION TO THE COST SAVINGS THAT WILL BE PRODUCED BY THESE PROJECTS ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN THOUSAND JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE K. TWELVE PROP THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE PROGRAM. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM FUNDING ALLOCATIONS TO THE PROGRAM EXPIRED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS IS LEFT CALIFORNIA WITHOUT A STATE WIDE PROGRAM TO MAKE SCHOOLS MORE RESOURCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENT. A LACK OF STATEWIDE PROGRAM IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING GIVEN THE INCREASING ENERGY DEMANDS THAT SCHOOLS FACE TO SUPPORT THE GROWING USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY. PROVIDING A ONE TIME THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO CLEAN ENERGY JOB CREATION PROGRAM IS A SMALL WAY TO CONTINUE A PROGRAM THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BY PROVIDING APPROPRIATION TO THIS PROGRAM CALIFORNIA'S TAKE ACE STEP CLOSER TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS REDUCE ENERGY COSTS FOR SCHOOLS AND CREATE GOOD JOBS WHILE PROVIDING A PIPELINE FOR SKILLED WORKFORCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THAT ALLOCATION SECOND IN MY CAPACITY AS CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL ONGOING ALLOCATION FOR THE LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS IN A SHE TÃ¬M.

A POLICY TRACTION FROM STATE LEGISLATORS AND CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS LPP AYE IS GEARING UP FOR MULTI YEAR PROJECT ON THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS WHICH IS A POLICY PRIORITY FOR OUR CAUCUS. TO OPERATE AT FULL CAPACITY THEY'LL PP I WILL NEED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY IN CORE OPERATING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE TO MANAGE FACULTY RESEARCH SUPPORT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. STRENGTH IN THE LEADERSHIP PIPELINE AND DISSEMINATE DATA IN POLICY IDEAS TO STAKEHOLDERS. AT A TIME WHEN THE LATINO POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW IN I. PROVIDES IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT LAWMAKERS UNDERSTAND THE BEST PRACTICES. THAT AMPLIFY POLICY INNOVATION TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACED WITHIN THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE STATE BUDGET ALLOCATE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR LP PI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU.

TO GIVE US THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I AM STEVE KERR VALLEY CHAIRMAN OF THE UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER. I MADE A REQUEST FUNDING FOR TWO SMALL PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD DEPLOY OUR UNIVERSAL COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT APP WHICH IS A GAME THAT YOU PLAN A TABLET AND IS FREELY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. WE'RE PROPOSING A PILOT THIS TO SPEAK. TO A SMALL NUMBER OF LOW INCOME FAMILY CLASSROOMS AND PRE K. PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE CHILDREN THAT ARE AT RISK FOR LEARNING STRUGGLES -- WE'RE EMBARKING TODAY ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF NEUROSCIENCE IN OUR CALIFORNIA'S VERY OWN UCSF IS LEADING THAT WAY WE HAVE PIONEERED THE UNDERSTANDING OF COGNITIVE AGING DISEASES LIKE. ALZHEIMER'S AND DYSLEXIA AND NOW WITH THE SAME WORLD CLASS RESEARCHERS APPLYING THE SAME METHODOLOGIES TO YOUNG CHILDREN TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR COGNITIVE LEARNING DIFFERENCES AND HOW THE BRAIN DEVELOPS -- IN YOUNG CHILD. THIS PROMISES TO CHANGE HOW WE THINK ABOUT EDUCATION AND THE CRADLE TO CAREER TRAJECTORY WE BELIEVE THAT -- YOUR ZIP CODE SHOULD NOT TO BE A DETERMINANT OF YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. SO WE RAISE MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH PRIVATE DONORS IN A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO ADDRESS THE SOLVABLE PROBLEM WHICH OTHERWISE IS FILLING THE KINDERGARTEN. TO TO A PRISON PIPELINE THANK YOU. BRENT SPENCE ON BEHALF OF THE NO KID HUNGRY CAMPAIGN AND WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO AND BOUGHT THIS PRACTICE AFTER THE BELL. PROPOSAL -- JUST A FEW POINTS OVER HALF OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS -- QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL FREE AND REDUCED SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM YET ONLY 30% ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE AND WE FOUND THAT THE BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED PARTICIPATION TREMENDOUSLY WITH VARIOUS PROGRAMS OF CORPORATE ID CORPORATE ELEMENTS OF MULTIPLE MODELS WHICH ARE. THAT PORK DIFFERENT THAT LOOK DIFFERENTLY NEED SCHOOL -- WE SAW BROUGHT EXPANSION OF THE PRACTICE AFTER THE BILL PROGRAM WHEN THE CD HAD FUNDING FOR EXPANSION GRANTS IN THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR. AND WE KNOW OF CALIFORNIA REINSTATES THIS FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM THE RETURN OF THAT SOME BE SIGNIFICANT TRIPS AT SCHOOL NURSES WILL CEASE CRY CARNAGE DROPPED ARTS STRIPS A SCHOOL NURSES WILL.

HI THANK YOU TRACI PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES I'M ON HERE OBVIOUSLY TO SPEAK ON CHILD HUNGER BUT ALSO LIKE MS RUBIO WITH A DECADE OF EXPERIENCE WORKING IN VERY HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS. AS A PARENT OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENT MYSELF AND A MEMBER OF THAT SCHOOL SITE COUNCIL SO I WANT TO SPOT SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO OUR SUPPORT FOR HIS RUBIO AND A BONTA PROPOSAL FOR BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL WHICH WE WORKED ON A IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE CHAIR MCCARTY. A VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT MOVE FORWARD AGAIN THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT IS A ONE TIME GRANTS THAT LEAD TO SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS THAT BOTH DO WHAT KIDS NEED BUT ALSO INCREASES REVENUE TO SCHOOLS. SO THE ONE TIME GRANT THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO SUSTAINABLE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THE STATE DOES NOT NEED TO KEEP GIVING THAT EXTRA BOOST -- TO AND SO I WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY SENATOR REQUIRE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ THE CALIFORNIA GROWN FOR HEALTHY KIDS -- BECAUSE THIS IS SPECIFICALLY STRUCTURED IN A POLICY FORMA TO RUN EXACTLY LIKE LCF ROUGH AND TO SUPPORT EL CAP GOALS WITH CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE SO IT'S A NON COMPETITIVE GRANT STRUCTURE WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR RURAL SCHOOLS -- I SPEND SOMETIME THIS SUMMER AND RED BLUFF WITH FOLKS AT THE CSU CHICO HEALTHY COMMUNITY CENTER AND WHAT RURAL SCHOOLS NEED ARE NON COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR A GRANT WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO OFTEN COVER THE BASICS CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT. AND SO THIS SAYS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT RE HIGH POVERTY THAT OFFER UNIVERSALLY FREE BREAKFAST YOU WILL GET TEN CENTS EXTRA PER BREAKFAST FOR CALIFORNIA GROWN FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHICH IS WHAT KIDS WANT THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES WANT. IS WHAT GETS EATEN -- AND SO THROUGH THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT UNIVERSALLY FOR BREAKFAST AND BREAKFAST AFTER THE BELL. THERE'S A HUNDRED REVIEWED ARTICLES HERE ABOUT IT REDUCING CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM REDUCING TARDINESS SUPPORTING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT SCHOOLS TO BE DOING TO ME THEY'RE ALL CAPITALS.

WE BEGAN FOUR YEARS AGO. AND CURRENTLY HAVE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TEACHERS IN OUR NETWORK. THE NETWORK IS IN PERSON OR ONLINE FEELS THE NEED TEACHERS MUST ASK FOR TO LEARN FROM AND WITH THEIR PEERS WHAT WORKS IN CLASSROOM SIMILAR IS MINE WITH KIDS SIMILAR TO MINE. AND THEY'RE LEARNING THIS AND CONNECTED WITH TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE TO KNOW THAT. UNFORTUNATELY TEACHERS ALSO KNOW THAT MOST PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES COMING GO. WITH OUR INITIAL SEED FINANCE SET TO RUN OUT THIS SUMMER A BUDGET APPROPRIATION WOULD ENSURE THAT THE BETTER TOGETHER CALIFORNIA TEACHERS INITIATIVE WOULD BE SUSTAIN AN EXPANDED. AND HOW'S THAT AS THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS THE ELLIE A WE KNOW TEACHERS ARE LEAVING FASTER YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY ABOUT RECRUITING NEW TEACHERS IN THE SHORTAGE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF THOSE SHORTAGES IS CAUSED BY THE NUMBERS. THAT 50% OF TEACHERS LEAVE AFTER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF TEACHING. THE BETTER TOGETHER TEACHER INITIATIVE HELPS TO ELEVATE THEIR VOICE GAUGES THEM AND LEARN AND LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES ONGOING PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND ACTUALLY INSPIRES THEM AND NEW TEACHERS TO COME ON BOARD. AS ONE TEACHER SAID [inaudible] THE BETTER TOGETHER TEACHER INITIATIVE WAS NOT ONLY INVALUABLE TO ME AS A NEW TEACHER INSPIRING TEACHER. BUT A COUPLE YEARS INTO IT BEGAN TO HELP ME IMPROVE WHAT MY TEACHING LOOK LIKE YOU'RE THREE AND FOUR AND GAVE ME CONTINUE TO GIVE ME A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON TEACHING. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATOR TO JOIN US IN SUPPORTING SUSTAIN FUNDING. FOR BETTER TOGETHER. ON A SIDE NOTE THINKING OF THE FIRES OF THE RURAL COMMUNITIES.

AND WE DISCOVERED IN OUR OWN RESEARCH THAT WE'VE DOING WELL WITH CERTAIN CATEGORIES BUT THERE'S STILL AS PERSISTENTLY LOW GROUP AT THE BOTTOM. SO I SIMPLY WANTED TO REMIND YOU OF THAT FACT WE WERE TRYING TO DO SOME THINGS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR -- AND SO IT WILL ALSO WAITING FOR AN AUDIT ON THE FUNDING ITSELF AND FINDING OUT WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING AND HOW IT'S BEING USED AND SO FORTH AND SO ON WE JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH THE USE OF THOSE IN THE BUDGET OFFICE. AND HAVE SAID OKAY THAT TOOK IS DIFFICULT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET STARTED THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF HAVING TO SET THE STANDARDS. GIVING IT ORGANIZED GETTING PEOPLE TO APPLY SO FORTH AND SO ON SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL YEAR FOR THAT WHAT I HAVE REQUESTED IS THAT WE CAP IT OFF AGAIN A THREE HUNDRED MILLION AS WE HAD BEFORE BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE FINALLY A STARTING. FOR THE PROCESS IT MAY NOT TAKE A WHOLE THREE HUNDRED MILLION BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY THERE WE MAY HAVE USED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE VIEWS THIS YEAR I'VE ASKED. TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WAS USED OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND RELEASED SO THAT WE CAN. BASICALLY GIVE IT A RESTART AT THE AT THE FALL SO I TALK WITH THEM.

OF MID YEAR ALLOCATION REQUESTING IS THAT THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION BE BASICALLY CAPPED AGAIN AT THAT NUMBER WAS PUT BACK IN WHAT WAS TAKEN OUT. SO IF SO IF -- IF WE SPENT FIFTY MILLION AND IT'S REALLY JUST OKAY PUTTING IT BACK AT THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE NEXT YEAR YEAH SO THAT WAY WE CAN BEGIN TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS PROCESS OF THE LOW PERFORMING KIDS. AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE NEED TO MAYBE EVEN INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE OVERALL ILL CFF ONCE WE SEE WHAT ELSE EFF IS ACTUALLY DOING. OKAY YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE AND NO GUARANTEES BUT THAT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS MUCH MORE VIABLE IN THIS BUDGET RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED WOULD BE AND THAT'S WHAT I ASKED FOR RATHER THAN. SOMETHING ELSE I TALK WITH OF THE OVERALL BUDGET FOLKS IN A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE THEY SAID THAT WAS PROBABLY MORE REASONABLE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAD A SLOW START THIS COMING YEAR WE HAVING TO SET THE STANDARDS FIND A TO THE KIDS WORK. FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE USING AS CRITERIA TO DETERMINE THE LOW PERFORMING KIDS AND THAT TOOK ABOUT A SEMESTER AND SO THEREFORE AND SO THIS WILL GIVE US THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAD ALREADY WITH WHATEVER WAS SPENT.
