00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.261
FOR SHELTER PLACE WE

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.195
ESTABLISHED A GROUP CALLED

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.597
MARIN RECOVERS. WHICH WAS AN

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:20.866
EFFORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. TO

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.668
WORK WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.936
ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:26.305
INDUSTRIES. IN BURN CALORIES SO

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:28.974
RESTAURANTS. INSTRUCTION BASED

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:31.243
BASED ORGANIZATIONS RETAIL

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.547
ETCETERA- AND HAD LEADERS FROM

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:36.448
THOSE INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY MEET

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.983
WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ON A WEEKLY

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.853
BASIS. TO WORK OUT WHAT WOULD

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.655
BE THE BEST PROCESS AS WE

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.823
LEARNED ABOUT THE VIRUS. AND AS

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.659
WE LEARN WHAT THE IMPACT WAS.

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:47.993
ON THOSE SECTORS TO TRY AND

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.495
HAVE. YOU KNOW I GET A BI

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:50.829
DIRECTIONAL AND TRANSPARENT

00:13:50.896 --> 00:13:53.666
CONVERSATION- SO I THINK THAT'S

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.534
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- BEST OF

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.403
THE BEST PRACTICES. PERHAPS

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.605
THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.574
ALLOWS INDUSTRY. TO WORK WITH

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.108
PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTLY. AND

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.377
INDIRECTLY- THROUGHOUT THE

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:08.414
PROCESS. GROUNDED IN- WHAT WE

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.216
WHAT WE IN RANDOM MATRIX WAS

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:14.653
SET WHICH WAS THE WORLD HEALTH.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.187
ORGANIZATION DEFINITION OF

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.455
HEALTH. WHICH IS- A COMPLETE

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.058
STATE OF PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:20.693
MENTAL WELL BEING AND NOT

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.595
MERELY THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:24.563
AND SO WE'RE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.165
WELL BEING AS BEING INTRINSIC

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:28.000
TO HEALTH IT REALLY OPENS THE

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.134
DOOR FOR RECOGNIZING THE

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.603
ECONOMIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.071
WELL BEING ARE ALSO PART OF

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.606
HEALTH. AND NOT MERELY

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.641
ORGANIZING EVERYTHING AROUND

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.676
EXPLICITLY JUST PREVENTING ANY

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:39.245
PREVENTABLE ACTIVE OF

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.613
TRANSMISSION OF COVERT NINETEEN

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:41.880
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE WAY TO

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.249
ACCOMPLISH THAT WOULD BE REALLY

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.284
SIMPLY TO HAVE EVERYONE. BE AT

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.253
HOME CONSTANTLY NOT INTERACTING

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:48.387
AT ALL AND WE KNEW THAT THAT

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.389
WAS NOT FEASIBLE FROM AN

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:52.925
ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL STANDPOINT-

00:14:52.992 --> 00:14:54.560
SO JUST SOME OF THE MECHANICS

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.262
OF THAT MARIN RECOVERS GROUP

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.497
WEEKLY MEETINGS. INDUSTRY

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.466
INDUSTRY ADVISORS IN MARIN

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:01.867
COUNTY THAT INDUSTRY ADVISE

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:02.968
THAT WAS CHOSEN FOR THE

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:04.737
RESTAURANT REQUEST WAS ARMED BY

00:15:04.803 --> 00:15:06.505
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.573
NOW YOU'LL HEAR FROM

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.377
ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES SHORTLY

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:12.144
IN. ANOTHER PANELIST. THAT WAS

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.579
SO IT'S PROBABLY HEALTH. HEALTH

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.481
AND THEN AN INDUSTRY LEADER

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.348
FROM WITHIN THE RESTAURANT

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.517
SECTOR- AND THEY REPRESENTED

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.952
THAT SECTOR AS A WHOLE AND

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:20.853
WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:23.389
CONVERSATIONS- AT ON AN AD HOC

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:24.290
BASIS SOMETIMES AS

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:28.294
RECOMMENDATIONS CHANGED. OR ON

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.262
REGULAR BASIS WEEKLY MEETINGS-

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.830
WE ALSO HAD MEMBERS OF CHAMBERS

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:33.032
OF COMMERCE WERE PART OF THAT

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.500
GROUP FUNCTIONS- RIGHT AS

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:35.634
FORTUNATE AS A MEDIUM SIZE

00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:37.436
COUNTY SOURCE MONMOUTH COUNTY

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.837
TO HAVE THOSE. SOME

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.539
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE THE

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.207
WORDS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY OUR

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.044
POLICIES- CHAMBERS OF ALL THE

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.882
CHAMBER. ELEVEN ALONG WITH

00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:50.516
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF

SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCIL

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.853
MEMBERS AND THE BRANCH MANAGERS

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.189
A STATEMENT MANAGERS AS WELL-

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.691
SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:01.260
PROCESS WAS- BEFORE THE STATE

00:16:01.327 --> 00:16:03.228
DEVELOPED WHEN WE HAD US A SITE

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.663
SPECIFIC PROTECTION PLAN FOR

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.265
MARIN COUNTY. WHERE ALL THE

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.733
BUSINESSES WERE ABLE TO GO

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.401
THROUGH KIND OF A TEMPLATE AND

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:09.968
SAY OKAY THIS IS HOW WE'RE

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.303
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.371
DISTANCING THIS IS HOW WE'RE

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:13.839
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH PERSONAL

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.240
COVERAGE YOU KNOW ALL THE

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.676
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF SAFETY-

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.311
WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO PARTNER WITH

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.646
THEM. IN IN PREVENTING

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.647
OUTBREAKS THAT WOULD CLOSE

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.882
RESTAURANTS- YOU KNOW WHEN

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.251
SPACE FOR US WE HELP THEM-

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:27.653
CONTROL SPREAD WE HELP THEM

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.021
ACTUALLY GET WITH THE TESTING

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.556
THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PREVENT.

00:16:30.622 --> 00:16:31.757
HAVING TO CLOSE THE BUSINESS

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.691
THERE'S AN OTBREAK AND THE

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:35.027
STAFF. YEAH WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:36.295
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU ARE

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:40.132
NOT NOT ABLE TO GET. HAVE

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:40.632
ENOUGH STAFF TO KEEP THE

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:41.300
BUSINESS OPEN. SO WE WERE ABLE

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.502
TO- PARTNER WITH AND MOVE

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:44.837
MOBILE TESTING OPTIONS AND

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:47.272
OTHERS. OUT TO RESTAURANTS. OR

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.574
OR HAVE DAYS WHERE ALL THE

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.508
RESTAURANTS WERE ABLE TO SEND

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.610
THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR TESTING-

00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.512
GREW OUT OF THAT NEEDS YOU KNOW

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.980
DETERMINED IN THAT BRAIN

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:58.217
RECOVER SCREW- ANOTHER STRENGTH

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.319
WAS- NAVIGATING. STATE

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.654
RECOMMENDATIONS SO. AS THE

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.323
STATE YOU KNOW AFTER. OUR

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.591
SHELTER IN PLACE OBVIOUSLY THE

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:08.026
STATE THEN. IMPOSED A SEPARATE

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:09.595
SHELTER IN PLACE OF THE

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.429
BLUEPRINT TO THE TEARS OF THE

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:12.865
COLORS- WITH POLICIES OF THE

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:14.733
COMPANY THAT. THAT WAS

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.501
SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO ADAPT TO

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.902
THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THESE

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.138
THESE ARE NOT EXTERNALLY-

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:21.373
IMPOSED. ADDED RESTRICTIONS AND

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.443
REGULATIONS- WE HAD NO CLUE WE

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.012
HAD NO. WE HAD NO CONTROL RIGHT

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.882
SO- IMPORTANTLY. LOCAL THE

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:31.984
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.319
BE OUT IN LINE WITH CALIFORNIA

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.487
PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.955
REGULATIONS IN THE FRAME BUT WE

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:37.990
ARE NOT ABLE TO BE LESS

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:39.958
RESTRICTIVE SO. OUR STRATEGY

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.461
SHIFTED FROM LOCAL CONTROL. AND

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.729
LOCAL DIALOGUE BASED ON OUR OWN

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.397
RECOMMENDATIONS TO REALLY

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:51.103
FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN BEST.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.304
FOLLOW STATE REGULATIONS- AND

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:52.905
THAT'S WHERE THAT I THINK IT

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.640
WILL ALL END WITH THIS- YES FOR

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:57.209
MY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS JUST

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.344
THAT THAT- WHAT WE MIGHT DO

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.346
BETTER. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:03.081
THINK WAS WS THIS YOUR FRANKLY

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:05.684
A STRUGGLE FOR US WAS. IN THE

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.353
INTERPRETATION OF EVIDENCE WHEN

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.556
THE STATES- REQUIRE THAT

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:14.326
OUTDOOR DINING BE CLOSE- IT

00:18:14.393 --> 00:18:17.563
ALSO SHARES- IT WAS IT WAS A

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:21.500
CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF- IT IN

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:22.768
TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IS THE

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:23.869
EVIDENCE OF FROM MARK FROM

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:26.205
WITHIN IRAQ AFTER THE RECOVER

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.974
SCOOP. RESTAURANTS ASKING WHAT

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.376
IS THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR NOT

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.346
ALLOWING OUTDOOR DINING- AND

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.381
OBVIOUSLY. AT THAT POINT WE

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.583
DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG EVIDENCE

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:38.750
BASE FOR TRANSMISSION THAT

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:40.652
OCCURRED IN OUTDOOR SETTINGS

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:42.387
PARTLY BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.990
HAVE ENOUGH. ENOUGH TIME UNDER

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.693
OUR BELTS. FOR KILLING AN EVENT

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.861
THAT EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE TAKEN

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.629
THE FORM OF. KNOWN ACTS OF

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.364
TRANSMISSION THAT OCCURRED IN

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.133
OUTDOOR RESTAURANTS- OF A

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.337
CERTAIN YOU KNOW IT ENDS AT A

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.405
CERTAIN RATE UNFORTUNATELY. WE

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:02.341
OUR CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS WERE

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:04.643
NOT ACTUALLY ABLE TO ASCERTAIN

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.844
THOSE WITH THAT LEVEL OF

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.212
SPECIFICITY SO WE'RE RELYING

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.881
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:11.049
STAY WAS RELYING ON. ON

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:12.985
UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE OF

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.287
WHERE TRANSMISSION MIGHT OCCUR

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:16.755
WHAT THE CHARGE WAS AN ANNEX R.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:17.356
AND THEN APPLYING THE

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:19.324
PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE TO SAY

00:19:19.391 --> 00:19:20.459
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SETTING IS

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:23.795
SUFFICIENTLY. RISKY TO JUSTIFY

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:25.631
A POLICY THAT PREVENTS THIS

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:26.532
FROM HAPPENING EVEN IN THE

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.267
ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.968
WHEN THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED I

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:32.404
THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE. WE

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:35.140
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER- ENVY OF

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.241
THE AND THE STATE MIGHT HAVE

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:37.309
DONE BETTER IN TERMS OF

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:40.045
COMMUNICATING THE RATIONALE FOR

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.647
THAT DECISION THAT THAT AT THE

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:43.515
LOCAL LEVEL JUST FRANKLY WAS

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:44.750
WITH ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.885
HARDER POLICIES AS I BECAME SO

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:48.620
THE APOLOGIST. FOR STATE

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:50.422
POLICIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MY

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.257
RELATIONSHIP RESTAURANTS.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:53.592
SOMETHING JUST YOU KNOW TO BE

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:56.161
ABLE TO DEFEND AS A DECISION.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:20:00.432
AGAIN PROBABLY. THE

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.033
PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. ALSO

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:01.600
MAKING MAKING SURE THAT IT'S

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:02.768
THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:05.003
ORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY AROUND AND

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.672
THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE. ONLY

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.106
ENGAGING IN ESSENTIAL

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:10.542
ACTIVITIES SO YES FOOD IS

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:12.578
ESSENTIAL YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW

00:20:12.644 --> 00:20:14.346
AND RESTAURANTS ARE ESSENTIAL

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.315
FOR PROVIDING FOOD. BUT YOU CAN

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.317
YOU CAN OBTAIN THAT TO TAKE OUT

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:19.918
IT SO THAT AT AN OUTDOOR DINING

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.286
EXPERIENCE IS NOT DEEMED

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.156
ESSENTIAL- AND THEN- THE MENTAL

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.557
IMAGE WE'RE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:27.225
AND THAT THE VISION OF A

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.660
HEALTHY COMMUNITY WAS ONE WHERE

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.395
PEOPLE BY AND LARGE SHELTERING

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.431
AT HOME HUNKERING DOWN. NOT

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.633
ENGAGING SOCIALLY NOT OUTDOORS.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.834
I MEAN NOT NOT OUTSIDE OF THEIR

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.836
HOMES THAT WAS SORT OF A

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.373
NARRATIVE AROUND WHY WE WERE.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.408
CLOSING OUTDOOR DINING THAT I

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:44.142
THINK WAS NOT EFFECTIVELY

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.712
COMMUNICATED- AND I SAID YOU

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:48.880
KNOW A LESSON LEARNED. A LESSON

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.883
LEARNED THERE- AND THEN I'LL

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.453
JUST SEND TO S. I DO FEEL FOR

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.687
THE FUTURE I DO FEEL HOPEFUL

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.222
THAT WE ARE NOW IN A PLACE WITH

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.690
A VACCINATION RATES THE CASE

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.359
COUNTS CONTINUED DECLINE. JUNE

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.794
FIFTEENTH. IS THAT APPROPRIATE

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:05.297
HORIZON FOR US- AND WE ARE

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:08.100
EXCITED ABOUT- YOU KNOW MANY OF

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:08.667
THESE YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:09.901
THAT I'VE DESCRIBED A PROBLEMS

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.570
OF THE PAST. HOPEFULLY WE'LL

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:12.871
YOU KNOW WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.173
FOR THE NEXT TIME- BUT I AM I

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.842
AM SEEING THAT THE FUTURE IS

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.777
NOT ONE OF TIGHT REGULATIONS IN

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.213
THE RESTAURANT SECTOR- IT YOU

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:23.649
KNOW. FOR MY PART BUT IF I WILL

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:26.051
I WILL. OUR POLICY IN MARIN

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:27.152
COUNTY THE COUNTY LEVEL IT'S

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.687
GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE STAGE

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.222
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MORE

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:32.090
RESTRICTIVE THAN THE STATE- AND

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.292
WE'RE SEEING THAT IT'S LIKELY

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.927
TO BE. A SERIES OF A GUIDANCE

00:21:35.994 --> 00:21:37.663
IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:39.765
SAFETY AND PERSONAL CHOICE. AND

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:41.400
NOT TIGHT REGULATION AND YOU

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:47.572
KNOW IT AND EVERY ASPECT OF. OF

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.640
THE PRACTICE OF. APPROACHING

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.908
RESTAURANT. THAT'S THAT'S

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.209
ANOTHER SIGN OF THE PROGRESS

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.146
FOR MAKING. THAT CONCLUDES MY

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:56.014
REMARKS SURE THANK YOU VERY

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.949
MUCH I WILL ALSO BE SENT ABOARD

00:21:58.016 --> 00:21:58.950
HIS HAS TO LEAVE IT HAS A

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:01.920
QUESTION ONE OF THE GO AHEAD

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:02.988
AND PROCEED CENTER. THANK YOU

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.723
CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.159
PRESENTATION. I WANT TO HARKEN

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:10.562
BACK- I LIVE IN FRESNO COUNTY.

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.597
AND DURING THE DURING THE

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.166
PANDEMIC ONE OF THINGS THAT I

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:16.134
WAS KEEN ON GETTING ACCESS TO

00:22:16.201 --> 00:22:19.671
WAS. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:22.607
THE INDUSTRY TRANSMISSION RATES

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.342
MEANING- IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:26.378
SOUND POLICY IN EVERY REGION OF

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.313
CALIFORNIA SEEM TO HAVE A

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.781
DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.783
DIFFERENT PROFILE. IT BE

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.785
TERRIBLY HELPFUL AT THAT POINT

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.887
TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND-

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.155
WE'RE THE SIGNIFICANT

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:39.191
TRANSMISSIONS WERE COMING FROM

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:40.358
I WOULD LATER FIND OUT FROM THE

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:45.397
CALIFORNIA- OFFICIALS THAT WE

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:48.834
DIDN'T HAVE. THEM AT THIS AT

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.968
THE COUNTY LEVEL THROUGH THE

00:22:50.035 --> 00:22:51.803
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.538
DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THE STATE

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:54.539
LEVEL SO WE WERE KIND OF

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:56.508
RELYING ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:57.809
THE PATHOLOGY OF THE VIRUS TO

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:59.411
MAKE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:01.580
BOTH STATE. AND CITY LEVELS AND

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:03.682
AT THE AT THE REGIONAL COUNTY

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:06.184
LEVEL SO MY QUESTION TO YOU. IF

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:09.554
YOU COULD. I THINK THE PURPOSE

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.189
OF THIS COMMITTEE AT LEAST FROM

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:13.658
MY APPRECIATION OF IT IS WHAT

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.494
LESSONS CAN WE LEARN FROM WHAT

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.130
WE EXPERIENCED SO THAT WE CAN

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.132
INCORPORATE THAT LEARNING INTO

00:23:20.198 --> 00:23:22.501
PREPARATIONS ARE FOR THE

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.203
FUTURE. AND SO BASED ON THE

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.172
COMMENTARY THAT YOU HAD FIVE A

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:30.442
MOMENT AGO. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:33.211
HAVING A CENTRALIZED. PUBLIC

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:36.314
HEALTH DIRECTIVE WOULD HAVE

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:39.684
BEEN- MORE FORCEFUL AND

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:43.121
RELIABLE- WAY TO ADDRESS THE

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:45.857
PANDEMIC OR DO YOU NOW LOOKING

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:47.692
BACK FIND THAT THE REGIONAL OR

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.362
COUNTY BY COUNTY APPROACH WAS

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:56.802
EFFECTIVE. IF THERE WAS IT WAS

00:23:56.868 --> 00:23:59.104
A HYBRID IF SOMEONE SENDS THEM

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.872
TO THE FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWED

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:02.741
EACH COUNTY TO BE CLASSIFIED

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:05.143
BASED ON BURDEN. INTO CERTAIN

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.812
POLICIES THAT CORRESPONDED THAT

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:09.648
BURDEN- I THINK THAT THAT

00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:12.751
STRATEGY WHILE IT TOOK A WHILE

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:17.122
TO MAKE SURE- OVER THE COURSE

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.256
OF THE PANDEMIC- WAS AN

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:19.624
EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THIS IS NOT

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:21.092
MY OPINION IS THAT THAT'S THE

00:24:21.159 --> 00:24:22.894
BEST WAY TO RECONCILE BOTH THE

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.996
NEED FOR. EVIDENCE BASED ON

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:25.964
CENTRALIZED STANDARDIZED

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.866
PRACTICE WITH THE WITH THE

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.335
HERITAGE IN AT THE DIFFERENCES

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.102
AN ACCOUNT IN A STATE LIKE

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.971
CALIFORNIA. FIFTY EIGHT

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.940
COUNTIES HUGE DIFFERENCES IN.

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:36.208
IN EVERY ASPECT CULTURE

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:38.510
POLITICS RACES AS THEY ALL THAT

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.712
AS WELL AS TRANSMISSION RATES.

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:42.247
YOU NEED ASYOU NEED AS A

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:43.381
FRAMEWORK THAT HAS THAT

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.884
FLEXIBILITY. OF MY CONCERN

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.453
ABOUT COMPLETE LOCAL CONTROL

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.522
WOULD BE THAT- THAT THERE WOULD

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.324
BE A LOT MORE YOU KNOW OTHER

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:56.695
FACTORS OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE THAT

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:57.295
MIGHT DETERMINE WHAT THE LOCAL

00:24:57.362 --> 00:24:57.896
POLICIES WOULD BE. IN JUST A

00:24:57.963 --> 00:24:59.831
FOLLOW UP ON THAT I THINK ONE

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:00.298
OF THE LESSONS THAT I

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:03.468
PERSONALLY- TAKE IT AWAY FROM

00:25:03.535 --> 00:25:05.370
THE PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE. FIRST

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:08.006
OCCURRED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:11.276
WHERE WE- HAD- IS IN THE FORMER

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.078
ADMINISTRATION A DECENTRALIZED

00:25:13.144 --> 00:25:14.646
APPROACH MEANING THAT STATES

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:16.014
WERE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.783
OF THEIR OWN- AND I THINK THAT

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.919
CREATED SOME SOME CHALLENGES

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:23.221
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO.

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:24.656
PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCES WHERE

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.157
MUNICIPALITIES COUNTIES AND

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:27.659
REGIONS WERE COMPETING AGAINST

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.527
ONE ANOTHER IN SOME FASHION ON

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:30.929
THE MARKET. THEREBY INFLATING

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:33.365
THE PRICE IN MAKING IT LESS

00:25:33.431 --> 00:25:36.735
RELIABLE FOR BUILDING OUT A

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.070
PLAN SO IN ESSENCE. I THINK

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.605
HAVING A NATIONAL STRATEGY

00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:41.907
WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:43.508
HELPFUL. AS WE WENT THROUGH

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:45.877
THIS PROCESS BUT NOT HAVING

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:48.413
THAT. AT THE STATE LEVEL- I

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.017
THINK. THE- HAVING THAT HYBRID

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.551
APPROACH THE YOU'RE THE YOU'RE

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:55.954
REFERRING TO- IS A LESSON THAT

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:58.523
WE CAN TAKE AWAY AS HAVING

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.660
UTILITY- AND I'LL FINISH WITH

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:03.261
THIS IS THE LA COUNTY WHEN

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:05.664
ASKED WHAT THEIR TRANSMISSION

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.799
RATES WERE. IN THE RESTAURANT

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.668
INDUSTRY THEY HAD A REPORT

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.938
INDICATED THAT ROUGHLY 3% OF

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:14.306
THE TRANSMISSIONS THAT THEY

00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:15.240
COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE%

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:17.309
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY NO I DON'T

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.743
THINK ANYBODY ACTUALLY BELIEVE

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:19.244
THAT THAT WAS ENTIRELY

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.846
ACCURATE- I THINK IT HAS A LOT

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:24.282
TO DO WITH- A SHORTAGE OF

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:26.117
INFORMATION. IN A BUNCH OF

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.919
OTHER EXTERNALITIES OR HARD

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:31.056
INVENTORY IN REAL TIME- BUT

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.457
MOVING FORWARD WOULD YOUR

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.092
RECOMMENDATION BE THAT THERE

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:40.031
BE- METRICS AND- SAFEGUARDS IN

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.167
PROCESS IS PUT INTO PLACE. AT A

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:43.401
REGIONAL LEVEL OR EVEN AT A

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:46.104
COUNTY LEVEL. THAT WE HAVE-

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:48.440
TRACING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.874
HAD BASICALLY FORSAKEN DURING

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:54.079
THIS LAST PANDEMIC. YES YEAH I

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:56.147
THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:57.649
AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT MORE

00:26:57.716 --> 00:26:59.117
INFORMATION NOW THAN WE DID.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.518
YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AGO AND

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:01.119
MANY OF THESE POLICIES WERE

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:02.654
BEING DEFINED WE'VE LEARNED A

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.589
LOT MORE ABOUT THE RISK THAT

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:05.523
OUTDOOR TRANSMISSION IS MUCH

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.494
LOWER- THAT WASN'T AS CLEAR-

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.831
FOUR- WE ALSO. HAVE A BUILD UP

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:14.399
OUR OUR CONTRACT DISCUSSION

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.634
INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WILL GO WE

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:19.270
WILL BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN.

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:20.939
WHERE TRANSMISSION IS OCCURRING

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:23.775
MORE PRECISELY- ACROSS SECTORS

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:24.976
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:26.845
INFORMATION FOR US FROM A

00:27:26.911 --> 00:27:28.613
POLICY STANDPOINT. OR THANK

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.615
YOU. THANK YOU YOU ARE

ALL OUR MEMBERS I WAS AT THE

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:28.920
RESIDENTIAL TURN AROUND SO WE

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:30.788
DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:33.691

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.526
AND IT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT I

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:36.794
THINK THEY'VE GOT TO ACTION

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:40.565
TALKING TO OUR MEMBERS REDRESS

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.467
IS QUITE WELL REFLECTED ON THE

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.736
SURVEY RESULTS BUT WHEN YOU ARE

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:52.010

WE CAN DANCE WORKPLACE SAFE

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.480
POLICY. AROUND I WAS PERCENT OF

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:56.748
OUR FOLKS FACT THE NUMBERS THAT

00:31:56.814 --> 00:32:00.485
CAME IN RECENT TIMES. WELL SO

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.921
HAVE A 60% YES WHY AM STAY WILL

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:06.958
COMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY-

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.626
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERTS IN

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:10.261
FOOD SAFETY BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.330
THE LOCAL CONNECTIONS THEY WERE

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:13.931
ABLE TO THE BEST OF THEIR

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:15.900
ABILITY TO GET THIS INFORMATION

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:18.269
OUT AND EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE BOTH

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:19.904
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:22.407
THOSE CUSTOMERS WHY HE'S

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.775
REQUIREMENTS WITH THE HAND

00:32:23.841 --> 00:32:25.943
PLACED- I THINK THAT I HAVE A

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.946
LOT OF CHRIST. WAS FAIRLY HIGH

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.882
IN THE BEGINNING PEOPLE REALIZE

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:34.285
THIS IS A MASSIVE ABSENT TO

00:32:34.352 --> 00:32:37.488
ALLIANCE AND LARGELY- WELL

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.524
ACCEPTED IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.760
IT- THERE WAS INCONSISTENT

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.462
SUPPORT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.831
AND GAMES THAT COMES BACK TO

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:50.368
THE ISSUE OF- BALANCING STATE

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:53.004
AND LOCAL RESPONSE AS SOMETIMES

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:54.339
THE LOCALS FELT THEY SHOULD

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.007
HAVE BEEN MORE SUPPORT FOR THEM

00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:57.709
SOMETIMES LOCALS FELT THAT THEY

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.944
WANTED. MORE WELL THEY AREN'T

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.146
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:04.315
THAT ONE APPROACH AS I SAID

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:05.583
EARLIER IS BETTER THAN THE

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.452
OTHER BUT BY AND LARGE WE HAD

00:33:07.518 --> 00:33:09.587
THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HELP

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:11.756
EITHER IN EMPLOYMENT THE STATE

00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:13.991
POLICIES THE POLICIES THAT THE

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:16.060
HEALTH OFFICERS UNDER THAT SORT

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:19.397
OF POLICE POWERS I HAD AN

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:28.606
ENQUIRING CLOSING THE LOCAL.

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:29.707
LEVEL- TALKING ABOUT THE

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:31.209
COMMUNITY AND THE SAFETY PART

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:34.312
OF AND PROGRAMS AGAIN I THINK-

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.180
MINUS- WASN'T EASY BUT IN THE

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.549
EARLY MINDS. I LARGE PERCENT OF

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.752
THE- AND THE THIS OF THIS. THAT

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:43.421
WE HAD AND WERE QUITE RECEPTIVE

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:47.492
VERY POSITIVELY RESPONSIVE- I

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:50.995
GAVE OUT THE INFORMATION WHEN.

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.897
REAGAN MECHANISM AS AN

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:55.299
INFORMATION MECHANISM AND WE

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.834
ALSO PROVIDED SOME PUBLIC

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.069
SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:01.639
THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK WHERE.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.875
AT A GAME DR WRIST BAND FOR

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:06.244
INSTANCE WE RAN INTO PROBLEMS

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.246
IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN MANY

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:09.914
CASES AND NOT JUST THIS

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.849
INDUSTRY ANY INDUSTRY AND

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.418
ACROSS THE WORLD THIS WASN'T A

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.987
CALIFORNIA ISSUE ACROSS THE

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:21.325
ROAD WE DIDN'T. HAVE THE ONS

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.260
SAYS. OUR SYSTEM OF THE

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:24.729
QUESTION PEOPLE ARE ASKING. I'M

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:25.496
TO FIND OUT IF THE CAR WAS IN

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.632
NEW IS TO THE MOST INFORMED OF

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:30.601
SPREADING THIS PANDEMIC AND

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.370
WHEN DID NERVE RATE LATER

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.439
REALIZED THAT ERA SOULS AND

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:36.607
TRANSMISSION WAS PROBABLY MORE

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.843
IMPORTANT SO THOSE ARE THE SORT

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.012
OF THINGS THAT WE HAD TO ADJUST

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:45.116
TO AS MANY AS YOU WENT. ALONG

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:49.787
NEXT I BELIEVE. YEAH PARTY

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:51.556
RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.658
DIDN'T HAVE THE AUDIENCES AT

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:55.893
FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL-

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.062
I'M NOT SURE THE INFORMATION

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.731
WAS FRAGMENTED AND HE- EVEN

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:02.767
THOUGH WE TRY TO SHARE WHAT

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.002
INFORMATION WE HAD WE ALSO HAVE

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.938
TO BE COGNIZANT THAT SOMETIMES

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:08.906
PUTTING ON PUTTING INFORMATION

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.108
EVEN ADEQUATE INFORMATION WAS A

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:13.544
BAD THING SO AGAIN IT WAS A ONE

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.813
OF THOSE BALANCING ACTS. MOST

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.348
OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:18.683
HEALTH FOLKS HAVE A GOOD

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:20.818
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:23.054
OF THE CHAPTERS OF THE CRA OR

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.824
SOME BUSINESS COMMUNITY- GROUP

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:27.992
THAT THEY WORK WITH AS

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:30.528
REGULATORS ACT AS WELL IN THE

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.296
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AS THE

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:35.166
HAZMAT INDUSTRY OR THE INDUSTRY

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:37.168
THAT CAN REGULATE AND WE

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:40.605
UTILIZE THOSE FOR THE FOR THE-

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:43.508
GROUP THAT I REPRESENT THE

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:44.442
CONFERENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:46.344
HEALTH FOLKS WE WERE VERY

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.712
FORTUNATE AND PRIVILEGED TO

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.046
HAVE IT SOUND WORKING

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.915
RELATIONSHIP WAS HERE ARE AND I

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.750
THINK MAX AND HIS FOLKS ARE

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:53.918
FOLKS WHO COMMUNICATING

00:35:53.985 --> 00:36:02.927
FREQUENTLY WITH FAST. I THINK

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:03.661
THAT REALLY REALLY HELPED. ONLY

AND WE ANTICIPATED- SHOWS A

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:42.066

LITTLE BIT OF A- TO HEALTH- I

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:06.424
KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OFFICER

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.695
DIDN'T IT DIDN'T- NEW TO DO

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.096
LIST. IN AND THAT IS SOMETHING

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:13.397
LIKE EIGHTEEN OF EYE HEALTH

00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:15.199

ANOTHER LONG DAY IN THEIR

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.206
POSITION THAT THEY HELD

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.541
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.610

00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:28.379
PRESSURE. AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:30.348
HEALTH FOLKS WERE UNDER NOT

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.749
NECESSARILY THE SAME PRESSURE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.484

STATE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:34.385
IMPACTED. BY THE CODE NINETEEN

00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:35.753

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:38.188
THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY I

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:40.157
WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK OF IT IN

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.792
TERMS OF THE LARGER RESTAURANT

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.695
ECOSYSTEM- AND WHAT I MEAN BY

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:47.164
THAT IS THAT OF COURSE INCLUDES

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.798
THE BRICK AND MORTAR RESTAURANT

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:49.934
ITSELF. CERTAINLY THE TEAM

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.936
MEMBERS BUT THE PURVEYORS AND

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:53.470
SUPPLIERS AS WELL TO THOSE

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:55.572
RESTAURANTS THAT PROVIDE FOOD

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:58.275
AND ALCOHOL LINENS ALL KINDS OF

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:59.076
THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.444
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO RUN A

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:03.547
RESTAURANT- IN THE MANY MANY

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.983
MANY GROWERS AND THEIR TEAMS

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.718
THAT- ARE PRODUCING AND GROWING

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.620
THE FOOD FOR RESTAURANTS. SO

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.221
CLOSING RESTAURANTS LITERALLY

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.157
REVERBERATES ALL THE WAY BACK

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.858
DOWN TO THE SOIL ALL THROUGH

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.427
THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTO THE

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.162
GROUND WHERE THE FOOD IS GROWN

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.164
AND AT EACH STEP UNFORTUNATELY

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.333
WITH RESTAURANT CLOSURES-

00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:23.133
THERE'S NATIVE EMPLOYMENT

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.771
IMPACTS BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:28.339
THOSE SPOTS ALONG THE SUPPLY

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:31.241
CHAIN. SO OBVIOUSLY. VERY

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:33.210
STRONG AND DECISIVE MEASURES

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:35.212
WERE TAKEN TO CLOSE RESTAURANTS

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.448
BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY-

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.016
WE'VE HAD SORT OF AN EVIDENCE

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:42.786

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:44.922
NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL TODAY-

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.657
AND THERE IS OPTIMISM AND I'LL

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:49.360
GET TO THAT SHORTLY- THE ORDER

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:50.861
TO SHUT DOWN RESTAURANTS AND

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:54.198

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.367
DECISIVE BUT ALSO YOU KNOW

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.668
LOOKING BACK ON IT HAD SOME

00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.838

OPERATORS IMMEDIATELY THAT THEY

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.447
WITH NO FLEXIBILITY TO RAMP

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:12.983
DOWN OPERATIONS- IT LEAVES THEM

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.486
WITH NO ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY

00:44:15.552 --> 00:44:18.088
DISTRIBUTE ALL THAT PRODUCT AND

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:20.124
ALL THAT INVENTORY. OF FRESH

THERE WAS ALSO NO ABILITY TO

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:41.345

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.906
NUMBER OF OPERATING PROTOCOLS.

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.174

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:02.519

RELATIONSHIP- I WOULD SAY THAT

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.591
FOOD SAFETY. AND TRAINING

THAT'S OUR GAME THAT'S OUR

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.794
WHEEL HOUSE WE'VE ALWAYS DONE

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:16.633
THAT AND WE'VE ALWAYS. BEEN

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:17.234
REGULATED. BY THE- THROUGHOUT

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:18.835
THE STATE. SO WE ARE BACK

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.737
EQUIPPED TO DO THOSE. GRANTED

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:24.541
THE STATE A. FIFTEEN- BOOKLETS

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:27.277
A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE MEASURES

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.312
THE RESTAURANTS HAD TO TAKE IT

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.847
TO BE OPEN MANY OF THOSE- CAME

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.249
FROM THIS COLLABORATIVE WORK

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:35.586
AND SO WE APPRECIATE OUR WORK

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:36.086
WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.089
pPROTOCOL CERTAINLY COME WITH

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:42.025
GREAT EXPENSE- AND SO YOU KNOW

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.527
WE ROSE TO THE OCCASION WE DID

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:46.330
THEM ALL- I THINK THERE WAS NO

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:49.266
POINT AT RESTAURANTS- WE'RE

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:51.134
LOOKING TO DO ANYTHING BUT-

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.903
PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE DINING

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:55.105
PUBLIC AND THEIR TEAM MEMBERS.

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.374
I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT DROVE

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:58.442
ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:01.044
MADE. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC-

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:02.679
AND AGAIN IT POINTS BACK TO

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:05.382
BOTH THE STATE GUIDANCE- AND

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.783
THE COUNTY GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.453
COURSE THE COUNTIES DO YOU HAVE

00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:11.922
THE ABILITY TO ISSUE MORE

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.557
RESTRICTIVE GUIDANCE IN THIS

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.892
STATE AND IN MOST CASES. THESE

00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:18.895
DATA ACT AND- YOU KNOW THAT WAS

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:20.364
WITH THE APPROACH OF SORT OF A

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.500
REGIONAL RISK BASED ASSESSMENT-

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.135
AND SOME WERE MUCH MORE

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:28.605
RESTRICTIVE. THAN OTHERS

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:29.172
ALIGNED WITH THE STATE. THE

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.774
POINT IN ALL THIS- IS THAT IF

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:33.110
YOUR RESTAURANT TOUR YOU HAVE

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:34.478
THESE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:37.114
PROTOCOLS- AND BECAUSE OF THE

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.349
NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC- YOU

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:40.784
KNOW LOOK THE LANDSCAPE WAS

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.119
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING UNDER

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.287
EVERYBODY'S FEET BUT

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:46.189
RESTAURANTS IN PARTICULAR- AND

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.091
THAT MEANT. THAT HELP OFFICERS

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:49.393
WHETHER AT THE STATE LEVEL OR

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:51.061
THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.929
CONSTANTLY BEING FACED WITH

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:54.264
THIS VIRUS THAT WAS NEW BY

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.034
DEFINITION RIGHT- AND ALSO WAS

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.769
OUTSMARTING EVERYBODY

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:01.438
OUTSMARTING THE WORLD. AND SO

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.974
THAT WAS I THINK WHAT. MADE A

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:05.208
LOT OF THE PROTOCOLS AND

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:06.343
REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS FOR

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:10.247
RESTAURANTS EVOLVE. OVER TIME.

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:11.982
AND SO AGAIN EVERYONE DID THEIR

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.950
BEST WE FULLY APPRECIATE THE

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.319
ROLE THE HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.887
KNOW WHAT THEY WERE UP AGAINST

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:17.988
AND WE ALSO FELT THAT

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.990
IMPLEMENTING SAFETY MEASURES.

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.591
GIVEN ALL OF THE FOOD SAFETY

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.060
AND OTHER TYPE OF SAFETY

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.995
REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE FROM

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:26.430
THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.832
THAT WE DO DAILY WE FELT VERY

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:30.634
VERY EQUIPPED. TO IMPLEMENT

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:32.869
THESE- SO WE PUT OUR BEST FOOT

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:34.204
FORWARD EVERY STEP NO MATTER

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.839
THE COST WITH THE PROTECTION OF

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:37.074
OUR TEAM MEMBERS IN THE DINING

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.009
PUBLIC ALWAYS DRIVING EVERY

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.111
DECISION. SO MANY RESTAURANTS

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.412
CONTINUE RUNNING ON THE

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.247
ENORMOUS FINANCIAL LOSSES

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.016
ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.184
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.320
THE TAKE OUT MODEL- I KNOW

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.788
THERE'S THE PERCEPTION THAT

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:54.057
TAKE OUT IS SORT OF THIS THIS

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.325
GREAT THING AND FOR MANY

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.260
RESTAURANTS THAT IT IS BUT LOTS

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.563
OF RESTAURANTS. ACTUALLY DON'T

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.565
DO TAKE OUT OR THEIR PRODUCTS

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:02.733
DON'T LEND THEMSELVES TO TAKE

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:06.603
OUT SO IT IS NOT THE BE ALL END

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.106
ALL SAVIOR. BUT CAN YOU TALK TO

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.574
RESTAURANTS AND THEY TELL ME

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.142
THAT I DID THIS AND IT WAS A

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:14.344
HUGE LOSS FINANCIALLY AND I

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:16.747
ASKED THEM WHY. AND THEY SAY

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:19.082
OVER AND OVER AND OVER THEY RAN

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:21.151
UP THESE LOSSES AND THEY DID

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:22.552
TAKE OUT WHEN THAT WASN'T THEIR

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.354
THING- TO DO EVERYTHING

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:25.889
POSSIBLE TO TRY TO KEEP ANY

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:27.824
EMPLOYEES ON THE PAYROLL FOR AS

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:30.394
LONG AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT THAT

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.229
IS THE AMAZING STORY AND A

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:34.498
GREAT SACRIFICE BUT CERTAINLY.

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:35.899
AN EXAMPLE OF OUR RESTAURANTS

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:37.601
ONCE AGAIN ROSE TO THE OCCASION

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:38.735
SERVED THEIR COMMUNITY AND DID

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:39.903
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:44.775
EVERY LAST. LATE ON THE PAYROLL.

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:45.642
SO I'VE NEVER SEEN- GREW OF

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.110
EMPLOYERS- IN MY TWENTY YEARS

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:49.312
OF WORKING FOR EMPLOYERS- SO

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.047
EMPATHETIC. TO OTHER TEAM

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.983
MEMBERS- THE COUNTLESS

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.518
RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE AGAIN

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:55.485
THE GRAND CHAPLAIN ACTUAL

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.821
LOSSES. TO KEEP THEIR DOORS

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:59.256
OPEN TO SOME DEGREE EVEN IF IT

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.557
WAS JUST FOR A TRICKLE OF

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:03.527
REVENUE TO KEEP STAFF ON. WAS

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:05.195
VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND SO IT WAS

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:07.097
IN IT CONTINUES TO BE OUR

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.965
WRENCHING REALLY- BUT I'VE

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:11.234
NEVER SEEN OR BEEN MORE PROUD

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:12.469
TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH AN

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.271
EMPATHETIC HARDWORKING

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.673
RESILIENT- AND SCRAPPY WHEN

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.708
NEEDED- TO KEEP THEIR DOORS

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:21.278
OPEN GROUP OF EMPLOYERS- SO AS

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.946
WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE I THINK

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.381
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:26.450
TODAY. NO WHERE IN THE STATE IN

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.518
A RESTAURANT FULLY OPERATES-%

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.053
AND THIS IS BEEN THE CASE SINCE

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.622
THE END OF LAST AUGUST

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.758
BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER- AND

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:35.826
THEN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.094
COUNTY. AND OTHERS IT'S BEEN

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:40.831
EVEN LONGER- AND FOR INDOOR

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.933
OPERATIONS IN FULL CAPACITY

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:43.433
THERE'S NO FULL CAPACITY

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.669
ALLOWED ANYMORE. WE'VE SPENT

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:47.437
THE LAST YEAR HUDDLED AROUND

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:48.939
EVERY TUESDAY WAITING FOR THE

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:51.007

FATE OF RESTAURANT OPERATIONS

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:55.679
IN EACH COUNTY- AND THAT

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:58.048
TUESDAY CADENCE CONTINUES. UP

00:51:58.114 --> 00:52:02.452
UNTIL TODAY AND WILL UNTIL JUNE

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.520
FIFTEENTH PRESUMABLY. SO WE'VE

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:04.688
KIND OF OPERATED AS THE

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.356
ASSOCIATION LIKE AIR TRAFFIC

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:08.391
CONTROL OR LIKE FOOTBALL

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.759
QUARTERBACK YOU TAKING THESE

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.628
PLAYS ARE DIRECTIVES FROM THE

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:13.830
STATE AND COUNTY. PASSING THEM

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.031
ON TO RESTAURANTS ON THE GROUND

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:17.100
IN EVERY POCKET OF THE STATE SO

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:18.668
THAT THEY COULD HAVE IT

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:19.970
IMMEDIATELY TO THE ORDER

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:21.137
FLUCTUATIONS OF THEIR

00:52:21.204 --> 00:52:22.739
OPERATIONS AND MAKE THOSE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.741
ADJUSTMENTS. SO WITH THE FAIR

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.210
APPARENT FULL RE OPENING COME

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:29.579
JUNE FIFTEENTH. VERY EXCITED WE

00:52:29.646 --> 00:52:31.681
THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY-

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.084
OPTIMISM IN THE AIR- BUT I

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.719
WOULD HOWEVER CAUTION THAT RE

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.054
OPENING IS THE FIRST MILE OF

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:40.757
THE REALLY LONG. ROAD AHEAD TO

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:41.491
RECOVERY FROM THE RESTAURANT

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:43.460
COMMUNITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.095
UNDERSCORE THAT RESTAURANTS

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:46.830
STATEWIDE AGAIN I'VE BEEN

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.131
FORCED TO OPERATE IT

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.933
UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS FOR OVER A

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.402
YEAR MEANWHILE THOSE FIXED

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:55.672
COSTS INSURANCE BRANDS AND ALL

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.607
SORTS OF OTHER THINGS-

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.409
CONTINUED TO BUILD THE ENTIRE

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:01.912
TIME THEY WERE CLOSE- AND SO

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:03.413
THAT THAT RECKONING IS GONNA

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.916
COME TO RESTAURANTS- FINANCIAL

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:08.518
RECKONING. RESTAURANTS ARE

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:09.686
GONNA NEED A LONG RUNWAY TO

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:11.288
PREPARE FOR A SUCCESSFUL TAKE

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:12.789
OFF AND IT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.457
THAT THERE'S NOT ANY DEGREE IN

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.393
THE RUNWAY AND THAT INCLUDES

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:18.562
POLICIES THAT ARE WELL INTENDED

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.430
THAT MAY HINDER THAT RECOVERY.

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:21.798
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THE

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:24.301
SIZE OF A RESTAURANT. THEY ALL

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:26.236
HAD TO NAVIGATE THE OSCILLATING

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:29.239
SET OF OPERATING RULES- IT AND

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:31.274
THEY WERE IMPACTED EQUALLY BY

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:32.642
ALL OF THE PROTOCOLS AND

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:35.645
RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER BUSINESS

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:37.013
MODEL. EVEN SMALL RESTAURANTS

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.014
ARE REALLY REALLY LABOR

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:40.183
INTENSIVE. MANY MANY MANY

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.952
PEOPLE OCCUPY SMALL RESTAURANTS

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:43.987
IN TERMS OF. MAKING A RUN ON A

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.689
DAILY BASIS RESTAURANTS ARE

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:47.757
OFTEN SIZED UP BY HOW MANY

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:48.992
EMPLOYEES THEY HAPPEN WE WOULD

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.294
JUST CAUTION YOU NOT TO DO THAT

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:52.062
BECAUSE EVEN THE SMALLEST OF

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.698
RESTAURANTS. I HAVE QUITE A

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:55.899
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.501
APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.170
THOUSAND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:02.339
IN CLIFORNIA WERE LAID OFF OR

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.908
FURLOUGHED BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.543
TWENTY AND THAT AUGUST.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.011
CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS AS YOU

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.346
KNOW FROM YOUR DISTRICT OF THE

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.581
CORNERSTONE OF EVERY COMMUNITY

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:14.150
AND 60% OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:14.784
RESTAURANTS ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:17.420
OF COLOR. RESPECTING THE

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.456
AMAZING DIVERSITY OF THE STATE.

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.857
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.392
RESTAURANT COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.426
THE STATE WAS AN ECONOMIC

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:25.629
ENGINE THAT EMPLOYS ONE POINT

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:27.764
FOUR MILLION. SERVICE WORKERS

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.766
AND GENERATED MORE SALES TAX IN

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:31.968
ANY INDUSTRY. WE LOOK FORWARD

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.837
TO BUILDING BACK TO THAT BUT

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:34.638
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:35.839
YEARS AND IT'S GONNA TAKE

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:38.008
PROACTIVE POLICIES ACTUALLY

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:39.809
LIKE CONSIDERING RETURN TO WORK

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.945
INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:42.545
THAT MAY HELP RESTAURANTS GET

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.881
THROUGH. THE FINANCIAL CRASH

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.783
THAT'S COMING IN SOME OF THOSE.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.118
FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT HAVE BUILT

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:49.919

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:52.555

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.314
BEEN IN THERE FOR ABOUT A TWO

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.915
HOUR PERIOD WITH THIS ONE

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.984
INDIVIDUAL- AND THEN THERE'S

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.118
ANOTHER THAT WAS THE MOST

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.687
DRAMATIC THERE'S BEEN OTHER.

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:12.555
OTHER EVIDENCE OF TRANSMISSION

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:14.157
WITHIN WITHIN RESTAURANTS I

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:15.191
THINK ALL OF US AT THE LOCAL

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:17.560
HEALTH OFFICER LEVEL IT IN OUR

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:20.196
CONTACT TRACING. HOW FOUNTAINS

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:21.264
ONE OF THE REASONS WE

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.266
PRIORITIZED A WORKING AT THE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.434
RESTAURANT FOR TESTING THEIR

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.102
EMPLOYEES AND B. VACCINATION

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.437
ONCE ONCE YOU KNOW ONCE

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.939
RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES BECAME. A

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.542
PRIORITY GROUP- FOODS FOOD

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.143
SERVICE SECTOR WAS WIDELY PLACE

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.045
AND ONE OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.146
OF PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED

00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:40.750
BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:41.551
INFECTION IN THAT SETTING. IT'S

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:43.686
A- KLAY UNDERSTANDABLE JUST

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:44.821
BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE KNOW

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.489
THE TRANSMISSION OCCURS.

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.024
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE CLOSE

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.793
TOGETHER. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.128
WHEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO COVER

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.130
THEIR FACES AND SO THAT'S THE-

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.332
THAT'S THE CHARACTERISTIC OF AN

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.635
INDOOR DINING S. EXPERIENCE.

00:58:58.701 --> 00:58:59.836
THAT IS CONCERNING FROM A

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:00.937
PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT AND

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.272
THAT FURTHERMORE WE HAVE HAVE

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:03.539
WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.775
TRANSMISSION IN THAT SETTING MY

00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:07.543
COMMENTS REGARDING. THAT THE

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.512
PAUCITY OF EVIDENCE AROUND THE

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:11.748
HARM OF OUTDOOR DINING IS A

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:12.949
DIFFERENT QUESTION AND THAT

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:13.883
REMAINS A QUESTION MARK IN MY

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:16.252
MIND- BUT I HAVE NO GOOD NO

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.120
DOUBT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:19.355
STANDPOINT. OF THE OF THE NEED

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:31.401
FOR- REGULATIONS AROUND DINING.

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:32.535
WHEN THE BUYER IS. PRESENT AND

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:36.172
IN THE IN COMMUNITIES CERTAINLY.

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:37.040
OXIDATION HERE I THINK

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:38.074
EVERYTHING. WHEN WE HAVE BACKS

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:39.676
RATES WHICH WHEN YOU'RE DOWN

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:40.944
AND ENTER INTO YOU UNDER. THE

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.178
OF THE- IN THAT IN. WHEN THE

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.012
REST TO THE QUESTION IS

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.481
ANECDOTAL DATA AS OPPOSED TO.

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:48.551
SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL DATA.

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.553
THEN I GUESS MY CONCERN I

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.488
UNDERSTAND IT THE SINCE WE

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:53.756
HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THESE THINGS

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:55.658
AND OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AS HE

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.026
SETS MY RECOLLECTION IN THE

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:59.762
UNITED STATES. I CAN UNDERSTAND

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:02.932
THE- LACK OF ORGANIZATION TO

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.600
COLLECT AND COLLATE DATA AT THE

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.869
BEGINNING. I'M GOING TO BE LESS

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.372
UNDERSTANDING AS WE MOVE TO THE

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.040
HOPEFULLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:15.244
THIS PANDEMIC SOON I HOPE. IF

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.179
WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER HANDLE

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:19.048
ON. STATISTICAL DATA AND

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.883
ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.318
TICKETS EARLY WE'RE TALKING

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.319
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.355
TODAY WHAT THE TRANSMISSION

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:26.856
RATE IS FROM A STATISTICAL

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:29.459
BASIS DATA THAT CAN WITHSTAND

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.128
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS BOTH PRO

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:33.830
AND CON AND ANECDOTAL

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.698
INFORMATION ABOUT A SINGLE

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:37.333
RESTAURANT WITH EIGHTEEN.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.636
INDIVIDUALS WHO- WHO CAME DOWN

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.237
THE CALL THAT IF THAT WAS THE

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.606
NUMBER. REALLY DOESN'T CUT THE

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.308
MUSTARD WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.642
KNOW THE PARTICULAR RESTAURANT

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.211
THE VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT'S

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:50.279
WHY THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.481
SORT OF STATISTICS THAT'S

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:54.884
COMPILED AND ANALYZED SO THAT

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:55.385
WE CAN SORT OF LEVEL THE

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.186
PLAYING FIELD. KNOW AND

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.721
UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEXT TIME

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.923
WE HAVE ONE OF THESE I'M SURE I

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.126
WON'T BE AROUND BUT- WHEN WE

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:05.294
DO. SOMEONE CAN MAKE A LOGICAL

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.929
DECISION AT THE VERY BEGINNING

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.831
HOPEFULLY WE SHUT THE ENTIRE

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:12.101
INDUSTRY DOWN. DO WE GO 225%

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.703
CAPACITY AND DOOR BECAUSE THE

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.139
STATISTICS SAY BUT THE CHANCES

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.974
OF TRANSMISSION WHEN THERE'S

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.108
ENOUGH SPACING AND THE

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.712
OCCUPANCY IS RESTRICTED 225% OR

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:25.081
MINIMAL OR DEMAND OF MISS. AM I

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:27.483
MAKING SENSE. AND DO WE HAVE

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.152
HAD SORT OF STATISTICAL DATA

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:32.021
AVAILABLE TO US. IN THE STATE

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:34.090
OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND IF

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:36.726
NOT. MAY WE AS LEGISLATORS

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:39.228
EXPECT TO SEE THAT. BY THE END

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.663
OF THE YEAR OR BY THE END OF

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.031
NEXT YEAR RELATED O THE CALL

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.468
OF A NINETEEN. TEN DAMAGE. MAY

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:49.005
I RESPOND TO AS A REGULATOR.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:53.876
PLEASE DO PLEASE. I WANT TO

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.178
REINFORCE THE DOCTOR WILL

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:57.613
ASSESS AND I AM NOT A PHYSICIAN

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.082
I'M MOST ONLINE BUYING THE HOME

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.017
FOLKS ARE NOT PHYSICIANS AND WE

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:05.888
RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON OUR-

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:08.291
PHYSICIANS. PARENTS AND OTHERS

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.826
TO MAKE THOSE JUDGMENT CALLS

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:12.028
BUT THEIMPORTANT PONT. THIS

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.630
WHOLE REGIME RESPONSE FROM A

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:17.533
REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE WASN'T

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.902
BASED ON ANECDOTE. BASED ON

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.538
VERY VERY SOUND PUBLIC HEALTH

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:26.375
PRINCIPLES. YOU CAN TRANSPOSE

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.411
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.645
IF YOU HAVE A DISEASE THAT'S

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:32.849
SPREADING AND TRIED TO ARREST

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.917
THE SPREAD OF THAT DISEASE. MAY

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.886
NOT HAVE HAD A RIDE ON SINCE WE

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:49.866
MAY NOT HAVE. TIME TO DO ALL

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.200
RIGHT THINGS BUT REMEMBER THIS

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:55.037
WAS TIME. VIRUS CORRECT FOR

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.674
THEM. PRINT OF TO RESPOND THIS.

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.776
AND I THINK THE FANS TO.

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:01.911
FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.046
HEALTH OFFICIALS THE I WORKING

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:07.450
SHELDON THIS INDUSTRY. HE'S

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.720
TRYING TO OPEN UP. THEY CAN DO

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:16.159
IT SAFELY THAT WAS PRETTY. THE

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:17.894
MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.696
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. ONCE AGAIN

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.698
THE PUBLIC SECTOR NOBODY WANTS

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.433
THE RESTAURANT STUFF TO BE SICK

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.637
SO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:30.106
WASN'T THIS. ANECDOTAL SORT OF

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.241
SUCKING IT OUT OF THE SUN THIS

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:33.976
IS HOW WE SHOULD GO ABOUT IT

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:38.414
THIS IS THE RISK. WE FOLLOW THE

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:41.117
SAME BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH. CALLS

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.852
FOR STOPPING INDUSTRIES AND

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.820
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE GIVEN BOTH

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.255
OF US LISTEN DON'T

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:48.524
MISUNDERSTAND ME. YOU MAY NOT

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.159
BE THE RIGHT PANEL HERE FOR ME

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.328
TO ASK HIS QUESTION. I'M NOT

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.463
BEING CRITICAL OF WHAT YOU HAVE

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.831
DONE DURING THIS CALL THE

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.166
NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHAT I'M

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.935
SINCE ITS PERSPECTIVES ON

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.102
IMPLEMENTATION WHAT I'M LOOKING

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.271
AT. IS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.040
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT HAVING

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:07.610
BEEN THROUGH THIS AS TRAGIC AS

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.112
THIS HAS BEEN. FOR EVERYONE

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.414
INCLUDING THOSE FAMILIES WHO

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:16.285
HAVE LOST INDIVIDUALS TO COVER

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.220
NINETEEN. I WOULD HOPE TAT

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.088
WE'RE FIGURING OUT HOW TO

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:22.225
COLLECT DATA TO. MAYBE CONFIRM

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.359
THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WERE

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:25.795
MADE DURING THIS CALL THE

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:26.329
NINETEEN PANDEMIC WERE THE

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:29.165
APPROPRIATE ONES. AND TO SET A

01:04:29.232 --> 01:04:31.200
STANDARD FOR RESPONDING TO A

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.468
FUTURE PANDEMIC THAT WAS THE

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.203
REASON I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.839
DATA COLLECTION. R. N. AND IF

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.307
THE ANSWER IS WE'RE NOT

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.142
COLLECTING IT THEN I GUESS

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:41.811
WE'LL GET THROUGH COVERT

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:42.678
NINETEEN AS A CALIFORNIA

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.247
LEGISLATURE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:45.147
TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED

RESPONSIBLE. FOR DATA

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.754
COLLECTION TO DETERMINE HOW WE

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:54.390
FIX THIS THING. BECAUSE YOU

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.891
KNOW IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.493
HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS I

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.094
WOULD THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.062
DATA. THEY WOULD INFORM OUR

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.831
FUTURE PROTOCOLS AND FUTURE

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.066
DECISIONS SHOULD WE FACE ONE OF

01:05:04.133 --> 01:05:05.968
THESE. PANDEMICS IN THE FUTURE

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:08.838

FROM RIVERSIDE AT FIRST FOR

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:57.253
CLOSING WITH THE FACT THAT WE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.055
DO NEED MORE DATA TO DETERMINE.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.423
YOU KNOW SHOULD THIS EVER

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.590

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:10.399
OF OUR DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW I

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:13.336
COME FROM A FAMILY WHERE I HAVE-A LOT OF CLOSE RELATIVES WHO

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.670
ARE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:17.840
AND- WHAT I WITNESSED WAS. A

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:21.944
SINCERE STRUGGLE. VERY SINCERE-

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:24.180
STRUGGLED TO KEEP THEIR

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.748
BUSINESS OPENED BUT ALSO DO

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:29.285
RIGHT FOR EMPLOYEES- AND IT WAS

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.920
VERY DIFFICULT I THINK YOU

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:32.555
WATCH MANY DIFFERENT

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.824
RESTAURANTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES-

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.959
A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS AND

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.461
MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC IN A VERY

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.229
DIFFERENT WAY. AND THERE'S

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.030
SOMETHING THAT I THINK MR

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.531
SUTTON SAID THAT STRUCK MY

01:06:42.598 --> 01:06:45.101
ATTENTION THAT WE KNOW THAT IF

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.602
A LITTLE OVER OR SOMETHING AND

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.137
I THINK I GOT THIS RIGHT NINE

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:51.006
THOUSAND- EMPLOYEES WERE LAID

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:52.408
OFF BY RESTAURANTS IN IN THE

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.543
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT MANY

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.212
MANY MANY RESTAURANTS DID THEIR

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:58.781
ABSOLUTE BEST TO KEEP S. STAFF

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:03.219
ON AND I KNOW HAT YOU'RE I MY

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:03.786
FAMILY THAT WAS PART OF THE

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:04.286
CONVERSATION. YOU ALSO

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.554
MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:07.490
POTENTIALLY WORK INCENTIVES TO

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.091
TRY TO GET FOLKS TO COME BACK

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:11.394
INTO THE INDUSTRY. ANECDOTALLY

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.728
I THINK AS THINGS ARE OPENING

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:16.065
UP WE ARE HEARING THAT- SOME

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.767
RESTAURANTS ARE SHORT STAFFED

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:18.667
AGAIN BECAUSE THE BUSINESS

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.136
MODEL IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR ALL

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.871
RESTAURANTS LIKE. RESTAURANTS

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:24.774
AND ALL THE SAME AND- I'M JUST

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.342
WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.676
SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES OR I'M

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:28.711
NOT SURE IF ANOTHER PANEL IS

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:29.678
GOING TO COVER SOME OF THOSE

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:31.080
INCENTIVES BUT I'D LOVE TO HEAR

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.048
SPECIFIC IF THERE ARE ANY-

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.850
PARTICULARLY AS THE RANGE FOR

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:36.652
THE DIFFERENT TYPES. OF

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.853
RESTAURANTS- CENTER IF YOU CAN

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.455
REACH ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:41.390
SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR IF THIS

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.758
IS GONNA BE ON IT. COMING AT

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:44.994
ALL. AND I BELIEVE IT'S A

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.062
QUESTION FOR MR SUTTON. THANK

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.898
YOU MR CHAIR SENATOR MONA

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:50.733
CREATED QUESTION- AND THE

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.402
COMMENTS- ON IT AND YOU KNOW

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.871
JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE JOB LOSS

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.973
THAT OCCURRED IN THE RESTAURANT

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.041
SECTOR WAS NINE HUNDRED

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:01.243
THOUSAND- AND THAT WAS THAT WAS

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:02.945
A SHORT TIME PERIOD AND AGAIN

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.413
THAT THAT'S DUE TO THE ABRUPT

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.349
NATURE OF THE DIRECTIVES TO TRY

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:10.219
TO RESTAURANTS- IT IN SO. TO

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:11.420
GET TO YOUR POINT ABOUT RE

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.855
HIRING YES WE'RE THAT'S ALL

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.424
WE'RE HEARING IT'S A NATIONAL

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:16.659
ISSUE. NOT LIMITED TO THE

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.928
RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IT'S A

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:20.830
IT'S A BROADER REACTION AND YOU

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:21.964
KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:24.467
PROPOSAL- TO SUGGEST ONE THING

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.634
THAT YOU KNOW RESTAURANTS

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:27.970
CONTINUE TO SAY TO ME. AND THAT

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:30.005
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:32.775
THAT THE STATE. IS IN THE SALES

01:08:32.842 --> 01:08:35.077
BEEN BLESSED WITH WITH ABUNDANT

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:37.112
REVENUE- I READ YOU MAY NOT

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.081
EVEN BE THAT WORK BUT HE ENOUGH

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:41.450
RESOURCES TO. TACKLE A NUMBER

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.818
OF ISSUES AND THERE'S LOTS OF

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.220
PROPOSALS THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.588
PUT TOGETHER IN THE U. S.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.223
LEGISLATORS TO PUT TOGETHER.

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:47.990
FOR HOW THAT SHOULD BE SPENT

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.425
AND THEN THE BIG DECISIONS IN

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.227
THE COMING WEEKS ONE THING THAT

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.162
WE CONTEMPLATE IS. YOU KNOW

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.763
THERE HAVE BEEN STIMULUS CHECKS

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.865
THERE HAVE BEEN ONE TIME

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.933
PAYMENTS AND THERE HAVE BEEN

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.169
THOSE KINDS OF RELIEF EFFORTS.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.637
FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND WE

01:09:01.704 --> 01:09:03.706
CONTEMPLATE SHOULD SOME SUCH A

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:05.107
THING EXISTS ON A ONE TIME

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:07.743
BASIS. TO INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYEES

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.145
TO GO BACK INTO. THE JOB MARKET

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.814
AND I WANTED THE JOB STAND

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:14.250
AFTER THEY- YOU KNOW HAVE THAT

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.318
JOB FOR APPEARED OF TIME WOULD

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.721
BE A ONE TIME STIMULUS OR TYPE

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.523
OF. SIMILAR TYPE OF PAYMENT

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.825
WOULD IT MAKE SENSE- BUT YOU'RE

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:24.593
RIGHT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST AT

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.528
THE BEGINNING OF FEELING THIS

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:28.163
CRUNCH OF THE DIFFICULTY OF.

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.798
EMPLOYING IN HIRING PEOPLE AND

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:30.833
I THINK THE RESTAURANTS ON THE

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.601
NEXT PANEL- MAY BE ABLE TO

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.435
TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.337
MORE. FOR YOU BUT I APPRECIATE

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.740
IT. AND THANK YOU MR SENATE AND

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:39.141
IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT CEREMONY

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.543
THERE IS A GOOD QUESTION TO WE

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.211
ACTUALLY INVITED. THE

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:43.846
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:44.647
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.382
FAKE- IN THIS HEARING

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.317
SPECIFICALLY WITH WITH AN EYE

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:51.620
TOWARD. THAT QUESTION AND THEY

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.489
WERE TOO BUSY APPARENTLY THEY

01:09:53.556 --> 01:10:02.064
DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE. SO.

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:02.665
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT SAYS-

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:03.866
MANY OTHER. FROM THE PANEL. A

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:06.335
GOOD BOARD JUST. THEN I PAULA

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:07.536
THIS IS SUCH A- IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:08.804
OF FOR ALL OF US- I HAPPEN TO

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:10.039
SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.073
DURING THE MEETING HIM THE

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.042
PANDEMIC WORKING ON. RESTAURANT

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:14.510
WITH RELATED MATTERS. MAYBE

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.844
I'LL POSE IT THIS QUESTION TO

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:20.049
MR SUTTON. AND I HARKEN BACK-

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.183
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.652
WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT- WHAT WE

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.788
HAVE TO LEARN. BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:31.260
TO BRING- TO BEAR- LESSONS FROM

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:33.395
THE PANDEMIC SO THAT WE ARE

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:34.897
BETTER PREPARED THE NEXT TIME

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:37.099
WHETHER IT IS. A VIRUS OR SOME

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:39.568
OTHER- NATURAL ORGANIC

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:45.240
CATASTROPHE- JUST A QUICK SIDE

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.710
NOTE- WHEN I DID ASK. A VARIETY

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:49.878
OF HEALTH OFFICERS IN MY

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:52.081
DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES ELEVEN

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:52.781
COUNTY SO IT'S PRETTY

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.883
SIGNIFICANT- NONE OF THEM

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:58.220
ACTUALLY HAD STATS OR DATA.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.321
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR AN

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.156
UNDERSTANDING OF TRANSMISSION

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:03.092
RATES BASED ON INDUSTRY. AND SO

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:05.794
ON A CONFERENCE CALL WHERE MANY

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:08.664
LEGISLATORS WERE PARTICIPATING-

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:11.166
THE QUESTION WAS POSED TO. DR

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:14.670
KELLY. IN THE RESPONSE WAS

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.605
PUBLIC POLICIES BEING MADE.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.207
BASED ON THE PATHOLOGY AND

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:20.542
BEHAVIOR OF THE VIRUS. AND I

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.878
AND I UNDERSTOOD- YOU KNOW WHY

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:24.446
THAT WAS THE CASE BUT I THINK

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.715
IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO NEED

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.984
METRICS WE DO NEED DATA IN

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.219
THOSE FINER POINTS SO THAT WE

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.154
CAN BETTER APPRECIATE. HOW TO

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:34.523
TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION- WITH A

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.825
SCALPEL INSTEAD OF A BROAD

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:39.662
SWORD WHICH GETS ME TO MY POINT

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.997
HERE TO MR SUTTON. TWO POINTS

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.232
THAT I THINK I'D LIKE YOUR

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:47.970
COMMENTS ON- DO YOU THINK IT

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.471
WOULD BE HELPFUL IN A FUTURE

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:53.509
SITUATION THAT WE HAVE. THE MET

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:55.177
THE LEGAL MECHANISM FOR THERE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.713
TO BE EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVES

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.580
PUT INTO PLACE AND WHAT I MEAN

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:01.417
BY THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.085
WENT INTO SHUT DOWN FOR THE

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.586
INTERMITTENT SHUTDOWNS

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.187
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE IN

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:08.223
THE STATE- RESTAURANTS. IN BARS

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.725
IN SOME INSTANCES WERE ALLOWED

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.593
TO IMMEDIATELY USE. THE

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.562
SIDEWALKS. AND THE PARKING

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:16.598
FACILITIES ADJACENT. TO EXTEND

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.667
THEIR SERVICES INTO THOSE AREAS

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.936
SO THAT THEY WOULD BE OPEN AIR-

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.971
SCENARIOS. SHOULD THERE SHOULD

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.207
WE BE RECOMMENDING THAT THERE

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:25.841
BE CERTAIN EMERGENCY

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:28.877
ALTERNATIVES- PUT INTO PLACE BY

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:30.512
LEGISLATION OR EXECUTIVE

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:32.414
AUTHORITY. THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.249
THAT TO OCCUR ACROSS THE STATE

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:35.651
AND ALL POINT TO SAN DIEGO IS

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:36.418
PROBABLY BEING ONE OF THE

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:39.621
LEADERS. IN THE IN DOING THAT.

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.890
THE DAY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF

01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:43.792
ONE THE SHUTDOWNS OCCURRED AND

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:47.763
THE SECOND. IS THAT NOT ALL

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:48.330
RESTAURANTS ARE IDENTICAL.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:49.832
CANNOT OVERSTATE THE OBVIOUS

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.867
BUT ONE RESTAURANT IN

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:54.203
PARTICULAR IN FRESNO COUNTY. IS

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.271
DESIGNED IT AS LARGE AS THIS

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:59.241
WHOLE- BYE AND IT IS COMPLETELY

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:02.044
OPEN. MEANING IT'S GOT WINDOWS

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:05.614
ALL AROUND BUT HAS IT ROOFTOP.

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:07.883
ESSENTIALLY IT IS AN OPEN AIR

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.052
RESTAURANT. THERE WAS LITTLE

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:12.521
FLEXIBILITY SHOWN TO THE OWNER

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.056
OF THIS RESTAURANT WHO WAS

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.891
BRINGING AND SCIENTISTS IN

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:20.729
PERSONS KNOWLEDGEABLE ON- ON ON

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.831
HOW TO DEAL WITH VIRUSES. DO

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.366
YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:27.302
HAVE EMERGENCY- LEGAL

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:30.305
ALTERNATIVES FOR FOLKS IN THE

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.974
INDUSTRY BUT IF THEY CAN

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.009
DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY ARE

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.544
SATISFYING THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.880
NEEDS. IN THE PROTOCOLS THAT

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.114
EXIST WHETHER BE THROUGH

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.717
VENTILATION OR BY ARCHITECTURE

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:43.552
AND DESIGN THEY SHOULD HAVE

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.654
BEEN GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO OPEN

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:48.690
UP. IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:50.592
THAN A COMPLETELY CLOSED SMALL

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:53.529
OPERATIONS OF YOUR COMMENTS AND

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:57.666
THOSE TWO HAD APPRECIATED. IT

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:58.734
OR JUST A PREVIEW OF THE

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.969
QUESTION YES- I THINK THE SHORT

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:02.738
ANSWER IS YES AND I THINK WE

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:03.672
LEARNED A LOT A NUMBER OF

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.874
THINGS- ABOUT THE VIRUS IN AS

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:07.776
WE LEARNED THAT AEROSOL

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:08.844
TRANSMISSION WAS A BIGGER

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.679
CONCERN IT MEANT THAT THOSE

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:13.081
OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS BECAME

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:15.184
MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL-

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.752
AND THAT WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:18.053
MEASURE BUT IT WAS ALSO A

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.054
LIFELINE FOR RESTAURANTS

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.123
DISCONTINUE DISTURB THE PUBLIC.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.025
AND KEEP THEIR STAFF ON BOARD

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:24.927
SO I THINK WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:27.629
THE LARGER QUESTION AND I THINK

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.931
WE LEARNED SOME GOOD THINGS AND

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.432
I THINK WE LEARNED THAT YOU

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.333
KNOW EXPANDING OUTDOOR

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.869
FOOTPRINTS- YET YOU KNOW WITH

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.405
SOME MODERNIZATION- AND

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.574
GUARDRAILS AROUND IT IT IS

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.742
SENSIBLE IT'S SO SENSIBLE. THAT

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.411
WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT TO BE

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:43.679
CONTINUED FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:46.215
LONGER VS IN LEGISLATION- AND

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.549
WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THOSE

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:48.984
CASES IT ACTUALLY MIGHT MAKE

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.253
SENSE PERMANENTLY BUT TO GET TO

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.088
YOUR QUESTION ABSOLUTELY WE

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:53.956
HAVE LEARNED THAT THOSE THINGS

01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:55.824
ARE GOOD COMMUNITIES LIKE THEM

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:56.658
AND THEY CAN BE DONE WITH GOOD

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.493
PUBLIC HEALTH. PROTOCOLS AND IT

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.761
CAN BE DONE WITH PROTECTING

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.264
PUBLIC SAFETY SO YES ON THAT

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.266
FRONT- AND WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.434
AIR FLOW AND THINGS OF THAT

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.402
NATURE YES I THINK WE'VE ALSO

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.438
LEARNED IN THIS THAT AIRBORNE

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:12.808
TRANSMISSION OF. THIS DISEASE-

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:18.146
WHAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN. AND

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:18.780
OFTEN RESTAURANTS. HE KNOW HAVE

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:19.348
A LOT OF A- AND RESTRICT ON

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.415
THEM. WHAT CAN AND CANNOT

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:21.516
HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO OPEN

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:24.753
AIR FLOW- AND SO- I KNOW A

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:25.954
NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.222
PEOPLE WERE JUST TRYING TO

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.024
INCREASE THE AIRFLOW IN THEIR

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.226
RESTAURANT. THE HELP. ON THE

01:15:31.293 --> 01:15:33.896
PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIVE BASIS-

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:36.365
AND THAT IS FOR BED AND- AND SO

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.966
SOME OF THOSE ARE BEING LOOKED

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.134
AT IT BEING RELAXED IN

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:42.104
LEGISLATION. TO CONTINUE- THAT

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.273
FLEXIBILITY AT LEAST FOR THE

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:45.707
NEXT LITTLE WHILE AND THERE'S

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.109
TWO BILLS IN PARTICULAR AND ONE

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:48.744
BASICALLY SAYS. YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.479
GONNA CONTINUE THESE THINGS

01:15:50.545 --> 01:15:51.280
SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:52.814
GOVERNOR CREW. WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.783
CONTINUE THESE THINGS FOR ONE

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.818
YEAR AFTER THE PANDEMIC STATE

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:59.087
OF EMERGENCY- YOU KNOW GOES

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.990
AWAY- SO. LONG ANSWER THE

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:04.159
ANSWER IS YES TO BOTH. AND

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.861
AFTER SHE HAD. APPRECIATE THAT

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.729
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.332
PANEL. SURE DOT. I THINK I

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:11.700
MIGHT WANT TO HEAR FROM THE

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.168
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ON THIS

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:17.773
JUST. BRIEFLY I THINK HE- IT'S

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:20.375
EASIER RETRO. TO HE'LL COME UP

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.311
WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE PLANET

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.146
ONCE AGAIN. YOU'RE NOT TO BE

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.714
DEFENSIVE OF THE DECISIONS WERE

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.749
MADE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:30.218
RECOGNIZE. THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.453
AND I THINK MAYBE WHAT WE'RE

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.655
LEARNING HERE IS FROM A TOP

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.791
PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. IS

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.259
THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:39.428
MOVING FORWARD. TO DEVELOP A

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.963
KIND OF PLAYBOOK FOR PANDEMIC

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.765
TYPE OF SITUATION. YEAH IN THE

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:44.766
FUTURE I THINK IT'S PRETTY

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:47.402
TOUGH TO- GET A BIG STATE LIKE

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:49.404
CALIFORNIA WITH FORTY. MILLION

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:52.441
PEOPLE TO BE GIVING FREE PASSES

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:53.709
TO SADDAM AND NOT TO THE OTHERS

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:55.210
AND- IT CREATES AS MANY

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.312
PROBLEMS AS IT IT SOLVES THE

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:58.947
FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW IF

01:16:59.014 --> 01:16:59.681
ANY OF THE HEALTH DIRECTORS

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:02.150
WANT TO. COMMENT ON THAT LAST

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.086
QUESTION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR

HARD TO. BE BETTER PREPARED FOR

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.566
THE NEXT RECESSION- MYSTERON

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:18.633

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.203
HUNDRED STAFF COLLECTIVELY

ACROSS STATE DOING. ENVIRONMENT

HEALTH THE ENFORCEMENT. YOU

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.576
KNOW THAT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH.

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.777
IN IN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.879
SO ALSO LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS AS

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:33.315
YOU RESPONDED DONE. AS TO HOW

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.616
TO HOW TO PLAN BETTER FOR THE

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:37.452
KIND OF SURGE. IN CAPACITY THAT

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:44.760
WILL BE NEEDED- IN THE EVENT.

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:45.394
OF A SIMILAR HEALTH EMERGENCE.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:46.728
RIGHT I MUST REFERRED TO THE

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.330
DOG. IN THE WRONG. BUT I WOULD

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:49.231
LIKE TO SEE ON BEHALF OF THE

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.400
RATE. AND AS I SAID WE TAKE ON

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:55.103
GUIDANCE. THE DOCKS- THAT WE

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:58.106
SHOULD. HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR-

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:00.575
CAPACITY IN LOCAL AND STATE

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.144
PUBLIC HEALTH. ONE OF THE

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:04.679
CHALLENGES WE HAVE. IN OUR

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:09.584
MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT A LOT. OF

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:10.285
PROGRAMS ON A FEW SUPPORTED.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.953
GENERAL JOHN TENNIS NOT A

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.855
NAGGING SESSION. I THINK IT'S

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.690
JUST AN OBSERVATION I BELIEVE

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:17.392
THE HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.428
PROPOSALS TO GAIN GOING HAND

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.129
SAYING OUR CAPACITY TO DO

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.298
AROUND JUST LIKE WE'VE BEEN

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.466
TALKING ABOUT AND I DIDN'T MEAN

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.268
TO BE OVERLY DEFENSIVE. IN MY

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.370
LAST RESPONSE BECAUSE I DO

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:32.874
THINK THAT. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY.

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.544
SO ASKED HAVE THE NAME BECAUSE-

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:36.912
GOOD TO HAVE HIM CURRY COOL

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:40.382
DATA. TYPES OF DISEASES THAT

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.983
ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAT

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.585
ARE GOING TO REQUIRE A

01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.954
DIFFERENT RESPONSE IS GOING TO

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:48.990
BE AROUND A CHALLENGING BUT I.

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.826
SEE FOR ADDITIONAL FOR ALL

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.828
PUBLIC HEALTH IN GENERAL STATE

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.564
AND LOCAL DEVELOP THE CAPACITY

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:56.565
WHICH WE CURRENTLY DOESN'T

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:59.000
HAVE. YOU KNOW Y'ALL CORRECT

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:00.202
YES MA'AM DON'T HAVE ANY

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.838
EMPIRICAL DATA TO HOLD UP AND

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.973
SHOW THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IN

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.975
SOME CASES AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.211
HAVE TO RELY ON COMMON MEDICAL

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:12.047
SESSIONS AND PROTOCOLS AND

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.782
IMPENDING ALLERGY IT'S CETERA.

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.050
FINANCIAL THAT WE DOING THE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.885
BEST THAT WE CAN. BUT I THINK

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.087
DOCTOR WAS MADE NOW TO EXPLAIN

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.156
WHAT CAPACITY WHEN TRYING TO

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.657
DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.926
BROADER CAPABILITIES FOR THE

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:30.031
NEXT. TIME WHICH HOPEFULLY ONE

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.399
COME. YEAH THANK YOU- YEAH I

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:33.335
AGREE I MEAN I THAT'S- THAT'S A

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.469
QUESTION ROSS STRUGGLING WITH

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.438
AT THIS POINT NOW AS WE START

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:38.006
TO EMERGE OUT OF THIS I THINK

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:40.308
WE'RE ALL. ALL LOOKING AT THE

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.510
AT THE LESSONS LEARNED IN

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:43.745
DIFFERENT SECTORS TODAY'S YOU

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:44.346
KNOW TALKING ABOUT RESTAURANTS

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.481
BUT IT'S REALLY. THIS IS THE

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.049
SAME CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.851
ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS AND I

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.052
WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:52.888
QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AROUND.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.756
DATA NE OF THE ONE OF THE

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.692
REASONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:26.688
MEAN IT'S NOT A LITTLE INCREASE

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:27.856
RIGHT TO USE A RESTAURANT AN

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:28.890

THOROUGH CONTACT INVESTIGATION

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.876
FOR EACH CASE SO I THINK ONE OF

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.678
THE KEY TAKE HOMES IS THAT WE

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.913
NEED TO HAVE THAT. TRUE PUBLIC

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.548
HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.483

PANDEMIC WHEN IT OCCURS. AND

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:58.820
THAT'S A GOOD THING PART OF THE

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:01.723
PART OF THE WORK OF THE FUTURE-

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:02.657
AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.793
WORKING WITH- WITH LEGISLATORS

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:05.894
TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:07.662
ACTUALLY ABLE TO STAFF TO THE

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.197
CAPACITY THAT. THAT WE'RE GOING

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:12.634
TO NEED- DOWN THE ROAD. TO THE

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:17.372
QUESTION OF THE- OF THE- YOU

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:18.173

WHERE THOSE CONDITIONS ARE IN

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.257
PLACE SO I THINK AS WE STEP

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.092
BACK WE ALSO NEED TO BE HUMBLE

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:38.660
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT

ASSUME THAT. KIND OF DILIGENCE

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.447
AND GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:00.615
ASSUME THAT TO BE TRUE WHETHER

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.150
IT'S HAPPENING IN A CHURCH

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.051
THAT'S HAPPENING A RESTAURANT

REMEMBER BACK IN BUT THAT TIME

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:58.353

FURLOUGHED. ACIDITY STILL COULD

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.969
HELP PAY FOR ESSENTIALS.

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.037

AS YOU RECALL IT WAS A CRAZY

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.864
TIME PEOPLE CAN GET IT BUT

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:43.731
INTERESTING ENOUGH THE

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.366
SUPPLIERS IN THE RESTAURANT

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:47.468
BUSINESS AT AN OVERSUPPLY. OF

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:49.037
THESE PRODUCTS AND YOU KNOW

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:57.779
WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE OUR.

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:58.947
OUR EMPLOYEES FOR THAT. IT'S A

01:26:59.013 --> 01:26:59.614
RESTAURANT HAD A HUNDRED

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:02.016
EMPLOYEES. IN AFTER CLOSE. TO

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.585
TWO. TRAIN TO GO. WE DROP DOWN

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:04.852
TO THE SEVEN TO TEN EMPLOYEES.

01:27:04.919 --> 01:27:05.987
FOR REST. BECAUSE THE MY TO DO

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:08.222
TO GO DIDN'T REQUIRES PEOPLE

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:10.325
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SERVING YES.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:13.394
SO WE TRY TO TRANSITION THESE

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:13.962
TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.164
RESTAURANTS. DID YOU GO AND FOR

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.832
US IT WASN'T A VERY GOOD

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.133
TRANSITION WE'RE VERY

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.469
EXPERIENCE WE OUT. EACH YEAR

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:23.938
FULL ICONIC LOCATIONS WITH USE

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:26.374
AND- YOU KNOW FOOD IS. PART OF

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.742
THAT EXPERIENCE BUT THE

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.577
LOCATION WAS A HUGE PART SO FOR

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.713
US TO GO ACTUALLY COST US MORE

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:33.514
MONEY. AS THE NEXT COUPLE

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:36.084
MONTHS OF EXPERIMENTING WITH TO

01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:37.919
GO WE WERE ACTUALLY. LOSING

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.854
MORE MONEY THAN WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.789
GAINING. BY THE CLOSE. YEAH

01:27:41.856 --> 01:27:43.057
THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:43.925
BECAUSE A LOT EMPLOYEES WERE

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:45.126
HOPING TO SEE THAT THAT WAS

01:27:45.193 --> 01:28:00.308
KIND OF RAMP. UP AND BE

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.811
SUCCESSFUL AND FOR US. WE HAVE

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:06.147
A- REALLY LARGE OUTDOOR PATIO

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:07.615
SPACE WE HAVE A LARGE PARKING

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.218
AREAS. AND SO ONCE WE WERE

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.153
ALLOWED TO INVITE GUESTS BACK

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.422
TO OUR SITES. I WOULD SAY WE

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.724

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.693
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR A

GOING TO BE A WAYS DOWN THE

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:58.519
ROAD WE DON'T ANTICIPATE EVEN

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.588
THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS. AND THAT

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:01.522
THE EVENT BUSINESS IS GOING TO

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:04.091
BE. THAT STRONG JUST BECAUSE I

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.194
THINK THERE'S A HESITATION. AND

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:07.361
WE HAVE A LOT OF CORPORATE

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.963
CLIENTS THAT YOU KNOW CORPORATE

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:17.038
GOING TO BE ON. RAMP UP ON THE

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.472
EVENT ISN'T ANYBODY IN THE

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.775
CATERING BUSINESS RENTALS THAT

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.443
KIND OF STUFF IT'S GONNA BE.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:24.912
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE. YEAH

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.714
AND- IT YOU KNOW TODAY WE'RE

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.016
FACED WITH HUGE SUPPLY ISSUES

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:31.118
WE TALK ABOUT LABOR. BUT ON THE

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.154
SUPPLY SIDE. YEAH BECAUSE THE

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:35.056
LABOR CAN'T GET YOU KNOW WITH

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:37.558
TRACKING. AND AND PRODUCTION

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:40.695
SIDE WE'RE SEEING A SUPPLY

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.663
ISSUE OUT THERE. IN SOME CASES

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:43.231
YOU KNOW IT'S TOO MUCH OF A

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:45.666
GOOD THING. AND I'M A LITTLE

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.034
AFRAID THAT YOU KNOW WITH ALL

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:49.136
THE MONEY COMING INTO EMPLOYS.

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:50.638
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:52.940
KEEPING HIM FROM WORKING. IN A

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.208
LOT OF MONEY IS FINALLY BACK TO

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.043
THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. AND

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.714
IT'S SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL IN

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.248
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S FLOWING

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:02.016
TODAY. YEAH PLEASE OUT OF WORK

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.417
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO

01:32:03.484 --> 01:32:04.018
SO THEY'RE EATING IN

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.052
RESTAURANTS AND SO THAT'S

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.721
FANTASTIC. BUT THAT'S KIND OF

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.055
THE SHORT ROUTE SHORT RUN

01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:09.957
SOLUTION FOR US YEAH WE STILL

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:13.094
THINK WHEN THAT'S DRIES UP IT'S

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.963
GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.631
WHAT ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:19.133
SAY IS THAT. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.835
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S CONCERN.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.069
I THINK IT'S REALLY KIND OF

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.071
IRONIC ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:25.172
I WOULD SAY GOING IN THE

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.909
PANDEMIC BEFORE. THAT R. AS

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.844
RESTAURATEURS OUR RELATIONSHIP

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.445
WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

01:32:31.512 --> 01:32:33.381
WELL IT WAS ONE THAT ALL

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:36.884
INDUSTRIES. TOP OF MINE EVERY

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:39.287
DAY WAS CAST SIXTY AN EMPLOYEE

01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:41.923
SAFETY. AND WE FELT WE HAD A

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.591
VERY UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.259
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT IF

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:46.794
THERE WAS A MESSAGE TO PROTECT

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:49.030
YES. OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:49.864
BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT I

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:52.366
WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW 99%

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.801
RESTAURANTS WANTED TO DO THE

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:56.003
RIGHT THING. THAT WE SHOULDN'T

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:57.204
YOU KNOW WOULD BE THE ONES TO

01:32:57.271 --> 01:33:00.041
BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE RIGHT.

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:03.110
AND UNFORTUNATELY. I'M YOU KNOW

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.645
AND IN THIS KIND OF TIES BACK

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:05.446
TO SOME OF THE STUFF THE

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:06.480
PROTECTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.416
GROCERY STORES BEING REMAIN

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.284
OPEN AND OTHER PLACES. NOT

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:12.119
BEING ASKED TO BE CLOSED I

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:13.354
THINK THERE WAS A REALLY AN

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.222
OPPORTUNITY TO RESTAURANTS.

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.557
TODAY THIS DAY I THINK THERE'S

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:17.892
A PROBLEM WHETHER PERCEIVED

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.527
MAYBE NOT TO BE A SAFE PLACE TO

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:21.696
GO TO BECAUSE- EVERYBODY WAS

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.930
BACKED AGAINST THE WALL TO SAY

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.532
WELL WHY ARE YOU CLOSING OR

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.833
CLOSING ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:28.202
SAFE. WHEN WE REALLY. MAYBE

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.203
DIDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.138
BUT PRECAUTIONARY WISE WE HAD

01:33:31.205 --> 01:33:32.340

JUST. HAVE THREE QUICK TALKING

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:41.402
PLAIN AREAS THAT I THINK WILL

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:43.337
NEED THE MOST HELP TO BE

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:44.939
SUCCESSFUL AS A RESTAURANT

01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:46.941
GOING FORWARD AND THEN I'D LIKE

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:49.977
TO TALK ABOUT THE REASONS WHY.

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.747
I'M FIRST IT JUST REQUIREMENTS

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:56.417
IN RESTAURANTS THERE'S BEEN SO

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.085
MUCH TALK ABOUT NO MORE MASS.

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:00.488
I'M WHICH IS HELPFUL TO SOME

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:03.424
GAS FOR US WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:06.460
INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY- SINCE WE

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:07.628
MOVED INTO THE RED CHAIR

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:09.230
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR BILLS ARE

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.664
STATIONARY AND EVEN THOUGH WE

01:36:10.731 --> 01:36:15.536
HAVE HUGE TALL PARTITION. ARE

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:16.971
WE CAN'T EVEN GET. PERCENT ARE.

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:19.006
IN OUR RESTAURANTS BECAUSE THE

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:22.343
DISTANCE TEAM- LOCKED INTO THIS

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.677
COUNTY PARTICULARLY CAN'T MOVE

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:26.247
OUR TABLES. WE'RE REALLY NOT

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:28.249
ABLE TO SEE MANY PEOPLE SO

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.650
WHILE THE MASS WELL IT'S

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.585
EXCITING TO SLAM IT IT'S NOT

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.921
GOING TO HELP DRIVE BUSINESS-

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:35.656
AND ALLOW US TO HIRE BACK WHERE

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:38.592
WORKERS- SECONDLY IT'S WITH THE

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:41.295
WORKERS WORKERS LEFT CALIFORNIA

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:44.031
LAST THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. I

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:49.236
THINK. THE STRUTS BROKE AGAIN I

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:49.970
MEAN. WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:51.539
I FIRST HAD TO HELP FURLOUGH

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:54.675
OVER TWO THOUSAND. BECAUSE WHEN

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.310
YOU SHUT CAME INTO PLAY NOT

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:59.480
ONE. BUT TWO TIMES AND THEY

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.549
WERE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY YOU

01:37:01.615 --> 01:37:03.617
HAVE TO SEND EVERYONE HOME. AT

01:37:03.684 --> 01:37:04.351
LOOKING BACK AT THE WHOLE

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:08.522
EXPERIENCE POSSIBLY WE COULD.

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.191
FOR THE LAST YOU PAUL IF YEAH

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.526
ACTIVE DATE WASN'T IMMEDIATELY.

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:16.897
I'M AND IT WENT ON FOR SO LONG-

01:37:16.964 --> 01:37:18.699
IN TERMS OF THE CLOSURE ARE I'M

01:37:18.766 --> 01:37:21.402
DINING SCENE AND THEN THE

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.536
CLOSURE AND OUTDOOR DINING. AND

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:23.871
THEN FINALLY WHAT THE BRAND

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.606
STANDS BECAUSE ORIGINALLY I

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.442
THINK THERE WAS LEGISLATION.

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:31.045
WELL RESTAURANT GROUPS WITH

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.279
LANDLORDS THAT WERE BEING

01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:34.415
UNREASONABLE AND RENEGOTIATING

01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:36.083
RENTS AND THEN THAT WAS TAKEN

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:39.086
OFF THE TABLE GOING FORWARD YOU

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.287
KNOW A LOT OF IT WAS JUST RIGHT

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.822
TO FARM IT AND EVEN THOUGH WE

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:43.557
ARE A LARGE RESTAURANT GROUP

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:45.826
OUR OVERHEAD IS VERY HIGH. IN

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:47.795
TERMS OF ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:48.629
GREAT WALLS WE HAVE IN

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.764
CALIFORNIA FOR OUR INCREASED

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:52.733
MINIMUM WAGE- BUT IT'S ALSO

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.336
INCREASED COSTS. AND WE'RE

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.005
STILL TRYING TO FIND A WAY

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:01.375
FORWARD- AND ALSO I THINK WHEN

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:02.576
YOU GET BACK TO WORKERS THE

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:05.045
IMMIGRATION REFORM REALLY HELP

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:07.715
US IN THAT AREA AS WELL. I'M I

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:08.882
JUST WANT TO MAKE BAD THREE

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:11.352
POINT TO KIND OF DRIVE THOSE

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:16.457
THREE SOLUTIONS I'M OFFERING.

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:17.891
OUR SUGGESTIONS. THAT MADE

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:18.993
SEVENTY AREAS SUCH. FOR US

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:22.129
DURING THE PAST. I PERSONALLY

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:25.099

I PROVIDED A LOT OF GUIDANCE

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:35.042
BUT THEN WHEN WE HAD A HEALTH

TACTIC PARTITIONS WE SPENT

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.146
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.147
DOLLARS I'M PAST THAT

PARTITIONS THAT. WE WERE NEVER

BEHIND THOSE WALLS AGAIN WE

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:30.698
HAVE MANY RESTAURANTS IN LA

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:32.700
COUNTY SO THAT MOST OF MY

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.768
EXPERIENCE. BUT IT WASN'T

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:36.704
NECESSARILY EDUCATION BASE

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:38.405
THERE WERE A LOT OF OCCASIONS

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:39.473
WHERE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.574

OTHERWISE AT THE SAME TIME

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.440
PROVIDING EMPLOYEES WITH

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:15.376
SUFFICIENT NOTICE WHEN WE HAD

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:18.879
TO CLOSE. TWENTY LOCATIONS-

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:20.347

HAVE THEIR OWN LENDERS. BUT AT

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:35.295
THE SAME TIME- THAT THAT GOES A

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.830
LOT OF OUR MONEY THAT WE

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:38.232
WEREN'T BRINGING MEN AND I KNOW

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:40.234
THERE WAS SOME ASSISTANCE FROM

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:41.435
THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS GREATLY

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:43.370
APPRECIATED AND UTILIZED IN

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:46.106
BRINGING BACK OUR WORKERS- BUT

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.141
IT IS STILL AN UNCERTAIN

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:50.411
FUTURE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:53.147
REOPENING- AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:56.083
HIGHLIGHT. HI I MEAN I HAD THE

OUTSIDE IN THE FUTURE LIKE SAN

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:02.055
DIEGO DID WOULD BE AMAZING

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:03.957
ESPECIALLY IN LA COUNTY.

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.492
BECAUSE I LANDLORDS FORCED US

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:08.061
TO RENEGOTIATE OUR LEASE SAYS

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:09.630
TO GET THAT EXTRA SPACE TO PAY

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.565
MORE FOR THAT SPACE IN THE

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:12.933
PARKING LOT. AND IT WOULD TAKE

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.635
WEEKS TO RENEGOTIATE IT AT

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:17.004
TIMES. I'M SO WHAT HELPED IF

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.504
THEY COULD HAVE DONE AND

FOR ME. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:49.155
TRYING TO COME BACK. AND OUR

01:48:49.222 --> 01:48:50.457

01:48:58.098 --> 01:48:59.766
WEEKS WE'VE HAD TWO PEOPLE

COOKS THAT WORKED UNTIL TEN OR

ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. AND WE

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.042
HAVE EMPLOYEES THEY'RE NOT

IN OAKLAND AND BERKELEY IN

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.649
PITTSBURG AND BAY POINT. A LOT

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.750
OF THEM RELY ON PUBLIC

TRANSPORTATION AND THERE'S NO

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.620
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RIGHT NOW.

01:49:20.687 --> 01:49:21.988
THE OTHER SITUATION THAT WE

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:28.228
HAVE. IS IN JANUARY WE. HAD A

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:30.497
MINIMUM WAGE HIKE WAIT A MINUTE.

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:31.865
AND LET ME TELL YOU MY MINIMUM

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.934
WAGE EMPLOYEE IS MY HIGHEST

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.835
HOURLY PAID EMPLOYEES THAT'S MY

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:38.238
TIPPED EMPLOYEE. WELL I CAN'T

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:42.242
FIND A COOK. BECAUSE ALREADY ON

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:44.477
THAT 45% LABOR COST BECAUSE

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:46.947
FEES KEEP GOING UP UNEMPLOYMENT

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:49.049
RATES GO UP AND WHAT'S GOING TO

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:50.784
HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS WHEN THE

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:51.885
STATE REALIZES THEY DON'T HAVE

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:53.486
ANY MORE UNEMPLOYMENT MONEY

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:54.788
JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS TIME

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:55.655
WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:56.890
UNEMPLOYMENT MONEY THEY'RE

01:49:56.957 --> 01:49:58.858
GONNA COME ASKING ME FOR MONEY.

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:00.226
I WROTE A FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:50:00.293 --> 01:50:01.194
DOLLAR CHECK WHEN WE FIRST

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:02.195
OPENED THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.531
THE STATE BASICALLY FIND SMALL

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.433
BUSINESSES ARE RUNNING OUT OF

01:50:06.499 --> 01:50:08.969
UNEMPLOYMENT FINDS. SO I'M

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:09.602
LOOKING FORWARD AND I'M LOOKING

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:12.272
AHEAD TO THAT. SO THAT MINIMUM

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:14.107
WAGE HIKE WHICH COULD HAVE NOT

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:17.077
BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. IT HAD ALL

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:18.445
OF THE REASONS WHY IT SHOULDN'T

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:19.379
BE I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA

01:50:19.446 --> 01:50:20.847
RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION HEAVILY

01:50:20.914 --> 01:50:22.916
ADVOCATED FOR IT NOT TO YOU. IT

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:25.051
DIDN'T GET PUT IN PLACE. SO NOW

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:28.121
MY PAYROLL HAS INCREASED BY 3%

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:30.290
BECAUSE AGAIN MY HIGHEST PAID

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:32.559
HOURLY EMPLOYEES JUST GOT A

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:33.193
RAISE BUT THE GOVERNMENT FORCED

01:50:33.259 --> 01:50:35.161
ME TO GIVE THEM. AND THAT'S

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:36.696
LESS LABOR DOLLARS THAT I CAN

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:39.966
PAY MY COOKS WHO LEFT THE STATE

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:42.435
WHO WENT TO OTHER INDUSTRIES.

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:45.438
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO MY HANDS

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:47.807
ARE TIED. SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:50:47.874 --> 01:50:50.343
FIND CREATIVE WAYS- WE TRY AND

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:51.745

PANDEMIC CAT I THINK THE THING

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:46.892
THAT STAND STOOD OUT THE MOST

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:48.394

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:24.563
OUR MINDS ALL OF US. DURING

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:26.899

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:38.711
LACKING WHEN WE WERE SUPPOSED

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:39.445
TO WEAR A MASK AND THEN WE

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:41.313
DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR UNDER A I

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:42.414
GUESS IT WAS WE DIDN'T HAVE TO

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:43.649

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:44.984
WEAR AMID EVERYTHING THAT

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.086
FOLLOWED IN THE ON THE ON ON

02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:48.320
THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.057

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:57.263
REALLY WAS MORE ANECDOTAL OR

02:03:57.329 --> 02:03:58.697
SPLIT STUFF PROBABLY TOO

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:01.567
SIMPLISTIC BUT IT BASICALLY WAS

02:04:01.634 --> 02:04:03.002
MORE TO DO WITH HOW THE VIRUS

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.227
IF ANYTHING WE CAN DO AND IF

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:17.429
THERE'S A SIMILAR PROGRAM AT

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:18.997
THE STATE LEVEL WE COULD CREATE

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.632

02:22:24.168 --> 02:22:25.136
GOING TO THERE'S SOME HOPE

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:26.504
WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:27.772
AND MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO BE

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.173
VERY SHORT I KNOW THAT WE'RE

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:36.080
SHORT ON TIME. BUT YOU KNOW THE

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:36.714
THE REAL THING GOING FORWARD IS

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:37.348
THAT. A COMMUNITY. IS A

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:41.552
CRITICAL. AND I THINK. ONE WHEN

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:42.754
YOU HAVE THE FOUR DIFFERENT

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:44.122
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT HAVING

02:22:44.188 --> 02:22:44.956
DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:46.658
COMMUNICATION. IT CREATES

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:48.426
CONFLICT. AND IT CREATES

02:22:48.493 --> 02:22:50.328
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CUSTOMERS

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:52.797
AND THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:53.398
ALL FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOT THE

02:22:53.464 --> 02:22:55.500
RIGHT INFORMATION. AND I THINK

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.001
ONE OF THE THINGS. WE DON'T

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:58.403
WANT TO DO IS WE DON'T WANT OUR

02:22:58.469 --> 02:23:00.638
FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:03.875
TO BE- REGULATORS IN TERMS OF

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:05.710
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT FOR

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:06.544
PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT OUR

02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:08.179
FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES WE DO NOT

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:09.747
TRADE IT IN. AND ALTHOUGH WE

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:11.049
TRAIN HIM SOME PORK NOT

02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:12.317
TRAINING CONFLICT RESOLUTION

02:23:12.383 --> 02:23:13.918
AND A LOT OF CONFLICT OUT THERE

02:23:13.985 --> 02:23:14.719
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.955
COMMUNICATION IS NOT GOOD IT'S

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:18.957
NOT CONSISTENT. AND IT'S NOT

02:23:19.023 --> 02:23:20.158
NECESSARILY RELATIVE TO WHAT

02:23:20.224 --> 02:23:22.126
WE'RE DOING SO VERY IMPORTANT

02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:23.461
THAT THAT THE COMMUNICATION

02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:25.330
COMPONENT OF THIS SORRY FOR THE

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:27.465
HANDS- THE COMMUNICATION

02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:29.267
COMPONENT IS DEALT WITH AND IF

02:23:29.334 --> 02:23:31.002
WE DO WE ARE CLEAR FOR OUR UP

02:23:31.069 --> 02:23:33.338
FRONT WE DO GIVE LEAD TIME. WE

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:34.739
GET PROCESSING TIMES TO PEOPLE

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:36.174
BECAUSE IT JUST SLAM SOMETHING

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:37.909
ON PEOPLE IT CREATES PROBLEMS

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:39.043
AND YOU SEE A LOT OF CONFLICT

02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:40.178
OUT THERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

02:23:40.244 --> 02:23:41.879
PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING. ENOUGH

02:23:41.946 --> 02:23:46.317
TIME TO PROCESS- INDUSTRY WISE.

02:23:46.384 --> 02:23:47.018
YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF

02:23:47.085 --> 02:23:48.319
RESTAURANTS HOBBY START CLOSING

02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:50.088
BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE CLOSE IN

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:52.190
A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK. MAYBE

02:23:52.256 --> 02:23:53.558
EVEN MORE THAN THAT THEY COULD

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:55.393
BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF.

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:57.328
FOOD AND A SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:58.896
BYE I THINK THE DEEP LABOR

02:23:58.963 --> 02:24:00.465
ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:01.833
ISSUE FOR A LOT OF RESTAURANTS

02:24:01.899 --> 02:24:03.334
RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN VERY

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:04.936
FORTUNATE WE WE'VE HELD ON TO

02:24:05.003 --> 02:24:06.971
OUR TEAM. I HAD TO CLOSE THE

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:07.638
THAT WHEN A PARK RESTAURANT

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:09.407
TEMPORARILY BECAUSE THIS NEXT

02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:10.975
IN ASKARI FARMAN. I WILL OPEN

02:24:11.042 --> 02:24:12.243
THAT UP AGAIN THIS SUMMER

02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:13.878
OTHERWISE WE HAVEN'T LOST

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:16.247
ANYBODY. THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:17.915
PART IS IT THERE'S A LADY NAMED

02:24:17.982 --> 02:24:18.649
PATTY REVELA SHE'S BEEN MY

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:21.219
PARTNER OW- FOR MANY YEARS

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:23.654
AND- SHE HAS BEEN OUT RUNNING

02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:25.590
THE COMPANY. FOR THE LAST

02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:27.392
FOURTEEN MONTHS. I HAVE BEEN

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:28.760
OUT BECAUSE OF MY AGE I COULD

02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:30.695
LEAVE MY HOUSE. SO WE MET ON MY

02:24:30.762 --> 02:24:33.164
FRONT PORCH- THREE TO FIVE

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.732
TIMES A WEEK TWELVE FEET APART

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:35.533
AND SHE WOULD GO OUT AND RUN

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:37.335
THE COMPANY. I THINK THERE'S SO

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:38.703
MANY PATTIES OUT THERE THERE'S

02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:40.605
SO MANY STORIES ABOUT GREAT.

02:24:40.671 --> 02:24:42.840
EMPLOYEES WHO AND GREAT IN THIS

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:44.842
CASE PARTNER WHO HAVE. REALLY

CARRIED THE RESTAURANT STRIP SO

02:24:46.544 --> 02:24:48.146
MANY AND WE HAVE TO START

02:24:48.212 --> 02:24:49.380
THINKING ABOUT THOSE. BUT I

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.616
THINK THAT. THE NUMBER ONE

02:24:51.682 --> 02:24:53.518
THING IS NOT ONLY DO WE NEED

02:24:53.584 --> 02:24:55.119
MORE MONEY AND IF THERE'S A

02:24:55.186 --> 02:24:56.554
SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR REQUEST

02:24:56.621 --> 02:24:57.622
AND ONLY TWENTY EIGHT BILLION

02:24:57.688 --> 02:24:59.257
DOLLARS. FIND THE OTHER THIRTY

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:01.592
TWO. OKAY THERE'S JUST THERE'S

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:03.494
ABSOLUTELY NO REASON NOT TO

02:25:03.561 --> 02:25:05.696
FIND IT. OKAY IT'S OBVIOUS THAT

02:25:05.763 --> 02:25:07.732
EXIST FIND IT FIND IT WOULDN'T

02:25:07.799 --> 02:25:09.801
GIVE THAT. THE OTHER THING IS.

02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:11.169
THIS IS A TWO TO THREE YEAR

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:13.404
RECOVERY. A LOT OF US HAVE

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:15.473
EVER. WE ARE WE ARE IN THIS

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.909
BUSINESS WE BELIEVE IN WHAT

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:18.509
WE'RE DOING WE LOVE WHAT WE'RE

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:19.844
DOING. AND IT'S NOT FOR THE

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:21.646
MONEY. YOU KNOW IF IT WAS FOR

02:25:21.712 --> 02:25:23.247
THE MONEY WE DO SOMETHING ELSE.

02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:24.916
BUT IF WE DO LIST BECAUSE WE

FOOD AND THE ONE THING THAT YOU

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:31.022
CANNOT DO. IS TAKEN INTO ST

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:36.260
HOSPITALITY- AT AND JUST LET IT

02:25:36.327 --> 02:25:37.962
GET A RACIST BECAUSE IT IS

02:25:38.029 --> 02:25:40.131
PANDEMIC MORE IMPORTANTLY. YOU

02:25:40.198 --> 02:25:42.066
