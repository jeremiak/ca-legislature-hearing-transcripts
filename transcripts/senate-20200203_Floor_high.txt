TRAGICALLY THEIR DAUGHTER LARA WILCOX WAS KILLED IN NEVADA COUNTY FROM A GUNSHOT AT THE AGE OF NINETEEN FLOORS LAW IS NAMED AFTER HER. AND IN THE FACE OF SUCH A TRAGEDY AND I THINK ANY OF US WHO HAVE LOST A CHILD IS VERY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO. JUST POUR ALL THAT GRIEF INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE AND YET THEY DID SO AMANDA FOUNDED THE NEVADA PLASTER COUNTY CHAPTER OF THE BRADY. UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE HAS BEEN IN OUR STATE CAPITOL REGULARLY. TO BASICALLY GET US TO ACT WISELY AND TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT AND REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE. SO AS I MENTIONED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE SHE'S BEEN THE LEGISLATION AND POLICY CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BREED UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE BUT IN ADDITION WELL LET'S STICK TO THAT FOR A MINUTE. AND IN DOING SO HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S GOOD GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LAWS INCLUDING THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER NOW COMMONLY KNOWN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THE RED FOR LAW. AND WE IN CAL THE WERE THE TO ADMIT IT SO NOW WE SEE OTHER STATES FOLLOWING ARE ARE GOOD- ACTION AND THANK GOODNESS IT WAS PEOPLE LIKE AMANDA IN NYC. WHO SHOWED UP HERE WHO BROUGHT US SUCH IDEAS AND SHOWED UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN TO HAVE US ACT SO SMARTLY. SHE ALSO SERVES ON THE NEVADA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH BOARD THE NEVADA COUNTY SUICIDE PREVENTION BOARD AND HAS BEEN A FOURTEEN YEAR MEMBER OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD IN HER AREA TEN YEARS AS THE PRESIDENT.

THAT SECRETLY SABOTAGED AND SLOWED THE PRODUCTION OF GERMAN AMMUNITION. WHAT THEY DID IS IN THE YOU KNOW THEY WERE THEY WERE FORCED TO WORK IN THE FACTORIES MAKING THE AMMUNITION. BUT THEY WERE SO CREATIVE AND- FOR THINKING THAT THEY PULLED THE EXPLOSIVE PANS OUT OF THE SHELLS SO WHEN THEY HIT THE PLANES RATHER THAN THE SHELL EXPLODING AND JUST KEPT ON TRAVELING THROUGH THE AIRPLANE. AND THE AIRPLANE WAS SAVED IN THAT HAPPENED TO SEVERAL CREWS. IN WORLD WAR TWO. FIRST A TENER RYAN- BRIAN WAS AWARDED THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS. FOR AIR MEDALS THE PURPLE HEART.
