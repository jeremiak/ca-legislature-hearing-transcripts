THIS HEARING THAT YOU'RE AWARE GOVERNOR NEWSOME CREATED TO STRIKE FORCE. TO EXAMINE THE STATE'S EFFORTS RELATING TO THE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF ENERGY. AS PART OF THESE EFFORTS THE STRIKE FORCE WAS DIRECTED TO DEVELOP A ROADMAP. THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES OF WILDFIRES. CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. LAST MONTH THE STRIKE FORCE ISSUED A REPORT ON WHILE PARTISAN CLIMATE CHANGE. IN CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE THIS SELECT COMMITTEE IS ESTABLISHED SPECIFICALLY TO EXAMINE THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT AND SUGGESTED OPTIONS CONTAINED HEREIN. THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT ON WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE IS COMPRISED OF FIVE PARTS. COVERING A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS IN SETTING FORTH A SERIES OF OPTIONS IN QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXAMINE. TODAY WE'VE ASSEMBLED SOME TO A DISTINGUISHED PANEL OF STRIKE TEAM MEMBERS TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF EACH PART OF THE REPORT. HOWEVER WE HAVE ASKED. THE PANELISTS TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE THEIR TIME ON PART. ONE PERTAINING TO A WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PART THREE PERTAINING TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF CATASTROPHIC QUALIFIER DAMAGES. AND PART FIVE PERTAINING TO THE P. JEANNIE SITUATION. THE OTHER SUBJECT TO THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT ARE THE EQUAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS SELECT COMMITTEE MAY SET TIME IN THE FUTURE TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THOSE PARTS OF THE REPORT. AS WELL. IN ADDITION THE SENATE'S CONSIDERATION OF THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ALSO ASK THE SB. NINE OH ONE COMMISSION ON CATASTROPHIC WHILE FAR COST RECOVERY TO CONSIDER THE OPTIONS IN THE REPORT AS WELL. THEREFORE WE'VE ASKED CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION IN OUR SENATE COMMISSION APPOINTEE TO GIVE US AN UPDATE -- COMMISSION ACTIVITIES DELIBERATIONS BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE -- ANY INTRODUCTORY MORE REMARKS. SEEING NONE WATER WE SYMBOL OUR FIRST PANEL. WE'D CROWFOOT SECTOR NATURAL RESOURCES TIM EIGHING ANYTHING POLLOCK OF PHIL'S INJURE. ENERGY PARTNERS IN NACY MITCHELL FROM O'MELVENY AND MYERS LLP [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DOT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR FORMING THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO SHARE. THE RESULTS OF THIS REPORT -- ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THIS REPORT IS TO INFORM THE DIALOGUE -- THAT YOU ALL ARE LEADING -- IN THE STATE SENATE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY ON THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES A MAJOR BUT AND MAJOR PROBLEMS SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR INTEREST IN THIS -- I AM HERE -- INTO IT TODAY AT THIS HEARING TO BOTH THAT SORT OF FRAME -- THE OVERALL REPORT AND AND WHAT WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO GET DNE WITH IT -- AND THEN I'LL OVERVIEW SECTION ONE AND THEN I'LL INTRODUCE -- MY COLLEAGUES HERE ARE REAL WHO ARE EXTERNAL EXPERTS THAT WE HAVE UTILIZED IN THEIR STRIKE FORCE PROCESS. SO I WOKE UP TODAY TO NPR -- THAT WAS REMINDING ITS LISTENERS THAT IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO TODAY -- THAT THE TOWN OF PARADISE -- EXPERIENCED WHAT IS REALLY UNIMAGINABLE TRAGEDY. EIGHTY FIVE LIVES LOST. NINETEEN THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES DESTROYED OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES. OF LAND BURNED IN JUST HOURS. THAT SAME MONTH IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE WALLS THE FIRE RAGED IN LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES. KILLING THREE PEOPLE DESTROYING SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND. JUST A YEAR BEFORE IN NAPA AND SONOMA THE TUBS FIRE. THE SECOND MOST IS DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. TOOK TWENTY TWO LIVES NOW 360-0 HOMES AND BUSINESSES AND DESTROYED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ACRES. ALL TOLD AS YOU KNOW TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WERE EASILY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE YEARS IN TERMS OF WILD FIRE DAMAGE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND WILD FIRES. BURNING ALMOST THREE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT'S ABOUT 3% OF OUR TOTAL LAND MASS. HUNDRED THIRTY NINE LIVES LOST. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES AND HOMES DESTROYED. DANGEROUS AIR QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE THAT -- WHILE SOME OF THOSE FIRES RAGED ACTUALLY HAD THE WORST AIR QUALITY ON THE PLANET. AND OF COURSE THE MISSION OF MILLIONS OF TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA'S TRYING TO LEAD THE WORLD. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION. THIS REPRESENTS A WILDFIRE CRISIS AS YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] AND A CRISIS THAT WILL VERY LIKELY GET WORSE -- GIVING CLIMATE CHANGE. WARMING WINTER AND SUMMER TEMPERATURES REDUCE SNOW PACK. DR WARMER CONDITIONS -- IN OUR FORESTS AND LONGER MORE PUNISHING DROUGHTS. AND THEN OF COURSE IN THE WAKE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRES AT THE END OF THE YEAR I I SHOULD SAY IN JANUARY -- PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC -- DECLARES BANKRUPTCY -- DRIVEN BY THE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE WILD FIRE RISK. AND OF COURSE THAT BANKRUPTCY -- AS THE GOVERNOR NOTED CREATES GREAT UNCERTAINTY FOR FIRE VICTIMS FOR CONSUMERS FOR WORKERS AND REALLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. TO RECOGNIZING THAT CRISIS -- SHORTLY AFTER THE P. GINNY DECLARE BANKRUPTCY THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE -- CALLED FOR AN ENERGY STRIKE FORCE TO BE ASSEMBLED. LED BY HIS CHIEF OF STAFF THAT WOULD DEVELOP. A REPORT IN SIXTY DAYS NOT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL IN THE LEGISLATURE AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND HE SAID HE HE WANTED THAT. THAT'S RIGHT FOR US TO TO FOCUS ON ACTIONS THAT WOULD ENSURE CALIFORNIANS CONTINUED ACCESS. TO TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE POWER AND TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR FIRE VICTIMS FAIRNESS FOR EMPLOYEES AND PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. AS I MENTIONED THE THE THE ENERGY STRIKE FORCE THAT PRODUCED THE REPORT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WAS LED BY ANNA LARY. INCLUDED OTHER LEADERS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INCLUDING CABINET SECRETARY ON AMANDA SANTOS. OKAY CORD THE DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND TEAM I JOIN TO THE TASK FORCE. THE TASK FORCE ALSO INCLUDED THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CHIEF OF CAL FIRE THE PRESIDENT THE CPUC THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THE C. E. O. OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR AND MYSELF SERVING AS THE SECRETARY OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO RETAIN -- THE EXPERTISE OF NATIONAL EXPERTS ON THESE QUESTIONS OF OF BANKRUPTCY THE FUTURE OF UTILITIES WILDFIRE -- AND OTHER TOPICS AND SAMPLING OF THESE EXPERTS ARE HERE TODAY TO SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE -- WITH YOU AS THEY SHARED WITH US. AND THE REPORT WILL WILL SUMMARIZING DISCUSS WITH YOU TODAY -- WAS WAS RELEASED ON APRIL TWELFTH AND IT WAS -- CALLED WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY FUTURE. AS THE CHAIRMAN NOTED YOU'VE ASKED US. TO FOCUS ON CERTAIN. AREAS WITHIN THE REPORT AND I JUST WANT -- TO SET CONTEXT FOR YOU -- AS AS IT RELATES TO THE REPORT -- AS I SAID I'LL SUMMARIZE SECTION ONE WHICH IS REALLY FOCUSED ON WILD FIRE. PREVENTION AND RESPONSE MITIGATION. HOW THEN TURNED TO TIM WEIGHING OF PHIL SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS TO SUMMARIZE BRIEFLY SECTION TO FOCUSED ON -- CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND HOW THEY'RE IMPACTED BY THESE SET OF EVENTS. AND THEN NANCY MITCHELL -- FROM O'MELVENY MYERS -- WILL THEN SUMMARIZE THAT THE LAST THREE PARTS OF THE REPORT -- INCLUDING. THE DISCUSSION OF ALLOCATING COSTS OF THE WILD FIRES. ARE DISCUSSING NEEDED REFORMS AT THE C. P. U. C.. AND THEN ALSO OVER VIEWING REPORTS RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO HOLD P. JEANNIE ACCOUNTABLE. AND BROADLY ENSURE SAFER UTILITIES. I AND THEN WITHIN A PRESENTATION NANCY WILL ALSO ASK NATHAN POLLOCK OF PHIL SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS -- TO TO SHARE HIS EXPERTISE. SO OVER VIEWING SECTION ONE AS YOU BASS CHAIRMEN I'LL A REALLY TAKE IT IN THREE PARTS -- ONE IS CHARACTERIZING THE PROBLEM AS WE SEE IT TOO IS SUMMARIZING THE RESPONSE OR OUR RESPONSE TO DATE IN THE NEWS MINISTRATION. AND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS DISCUSSION. OVER VIEWING FURTHER ACTION THAT WE BOOK THAT WE RECOMMENDED IN THE REPORT. SO AS WE ALL KNOW WILD FIRES A PART OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL ECOLOGY -- THERE'S THERE'S LONG PHYSICAL RECORD OF PERIODIC FIRES ESSENTIALLY MANAGING OUR FORESTS ALSO STRONG EVIDENCE OF A CALIFORNIA TRIBES ACTUALLY MANAGING FORCED THROUGH PRESCRIBED BURNS. I IN THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OUR POPULATION HAS EXPANDED INTO THE FORESTS THE OAKLAND THE CHAPARRALS -- AND WITH THAT WE'VE SUPPRESS NATURAL FIRE. AND WHAT HAS RESULTED IS A FOREST IN A WILD LAND -- THAT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT AND IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY ON NATURAL -- TO COMPARED TO WHAT IT ONCE WAS. TODAY ONE OUT OF FOUR CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AN AREA OF THE STATE THAT IS THREATENED BY FIRE -- WHAT WE WHAT WE'VE COME TO KNOW AS THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE OR THE WILL BE? NOT 25% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION OR ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. I AT THE SAME TIME AS AS I ALLUDED -- CLIMATE CHANGE IS COMPOUNDING THIS THE SITUATION. LONGER AND MORE INTENSE FIRE SEASON ARE CHARACTERIZING WHAT CAL FIRE AND OTHER AGENCIES HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- STRETCHING ON AVERAGE EIGHTY TO NINETY DAYS LONGER -- THAN IN THE PAST AND IN SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA FIRE SEASON IS LITERALLY -- YEAR AROUND -- A RECENT DROUGHT OBVIOUSLY CREATED AN EPIDEMIC OF TREE MORTALITY ACROSS THE SIERRA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED IN IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WHICH ADDS TO THAT -- FIRE DANGER. JUST CONSIDER THESE FACTS FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY S. POINT TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND HI AND TEN OF THOSE FIRES ATTENDED THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE STATE'S LAND MASS IS NOW -- CLASSIFIED AS UNDER EXTREME OR VERY HIGH FIRE RISK TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES. AND ACCORDING TO OUR FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WHICH IS THE SET OF SCIENCE THAT THE STATE FUNDS -- CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE BURN AREA WILL LIKELY INCREASE BY 77% -- BY BY -- TWENTY ONE HUNDRED SOBERING FACTS. TO RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS -- YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEW SOME ACTUALLY BEGAN TAKING ACTION BEFORE. BEING INAUGURATED IN SPENDING TIME OBVIOUSLY IN PARADISE -- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NEEDS OF A FIRE VICTIMS AND THE RESPONSE ONCE HE TOOK OFFICE IN HIS SECOND FULL DAY OF OFFICE HE ISSUE TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND I'LL TALK ABOUT BOTH. THE FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTED CAL FIRE TO ISSUE WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS -- SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY TO PROTECT OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THIS YEAR FOR THIS FIRE SEASON. AND THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTED CAL FIRE NOT ONLY TO RECOMMEND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS BUT ALSO A LONGER TERM ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS IN COMING YEARS. CAL FIRE I HAVE FOLLOWED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS ISSUED PUBLICLY WHAT A COUPLE WAS KNOWN. AS THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT I CALLED FOR A RECOMMENDED A RANGE OF ACTIONS MEDIA -- MEDIUM TERM AND LONG TERM. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS WAS AYE. EXPEDITING THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS ARE REALLY MOSTLY FIRE BREAK PROJECTS AROUND COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT TWO HUNDRED OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR READ THAT REPORT AND SHORTLY THERE AFTER HE DID SOMETHING FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED WHICH IS DECLARE A PROACTIVE -- PROCLAMATION OF EMERGENCY TO EXPEDITE THOSE THIRTY FIVE EMERGENCY PROJECTS. AND GAVE MY OFFICE ODD NOT TO RESOURCES SECRETARY THE POWER TO WAIVE C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND RULES TO ACTUALLY GET THIS PROP THESE PROJECTS DONE. WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT WITH THE SPECIFIC FOCUS OF PROTECTING -- THESE TWO HUNDRED MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I'LL MENTION AS WE'RE DOING THAT WERE RECOGNIZING THE GRAVITY OF WEAVING ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS AND WE'VE INSTITUTED A SET OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOR EACH OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT AVOIDS ENVIRONMENTALLY AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE RESOURCES. AND WORKS CLOSELY WITH REGIONAL DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OFFICES AND REGIONAL WATER BOARD OFFICES. TOO WEAK TO TO REALLY MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE OF THESE PROJECTS. THE GOVERNOR THEN ARE REDEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEXICAN BORDER TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE AND HELP CALIFORNIA -- I IMPLEMENT THESE THESE THIRTY FIVE EMERGENCY PROJECTS -- I SHOULD MENTION THOSE ARE TREATING ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND AROUND THESE COMMUNITIES. AND THE THOSE NATIONAL GUARDS MEN AND WOMEN ARE DEPLOYED IN FOUR AREAS OF THE STATE TODAY. OUT WORKING ON THOSE PROJECTS. THE SECOND EXECUTIVE ORDER THE GOVERNOR CALLED FOR THAT SECOND DAY IN OFFICE -- INITIATED WHAT WAS WHAT IS CALLED A INNOVATION PROCUREMENT SPRINT. AND THE DIRECTOR WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON BRINGING THE BEST TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION TO THE FIRE FIGHT -- WITH A FOCUS ON DOING WHAT'S NEEDED TO GO TO GO OUT AND SOLICIT THE BEST THE BEST TECHNOLOGIES THERE ARE. AND WE'VE YOU KNOW CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS SEES SO THAT WE COULD BEGIN PILOTING THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS EARLY AS THIS SUMMER -- AND THAT IS -- THAT IS ON TRACK. OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- FIVE RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS IS -- MANIFEST IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET -- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY AND I HAVE MORE INFORMATION I CAN PROVIDE ON THAT BUT SINCE YOU ALL HAVE REVIEWED THAT AND ARGUING THAT RIGHT NOW I WON'T GO INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT -- THE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS GETTING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO COMMUNITIES -- IMMEDIATELY -- TO IMPROVE THEIR PREPAREDNESS -- AS WE FACE -- THIS NEXT FIRE SEASON. SO THAT'S REALLY THE SET OF IMMEDIATE ACTIONS I THINK I HOPE THAT BOTH SORT OF FRAMING THE PROBLEM IS WE SEE IT AND THOSE MEDIA ACTIONS GIVES YOU SOME SENSE OUR CONTACTS. FOR THE FURTHER ACTIONS THAT THIS REPORT CALLS. FOR AND SO I WOULD CATEGORIZE CATEGORIZE CATEGORIZE THOSE THOSE FURTHER ACTIONS IN PART ONE OF THE REPORT REALLY IN FOUR CATEGORIES. ONE ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT THESE FIRES. TO HELPING COMMUNITIES BUILD THEIR RESILIENCE. TO DISTRACT THREE IMPROVING FORCE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH. AND THEN FOR OBVIOUSLY BUILDING SAFER UTILITIES. AND WHAT I'LL DO NOW IS JUST REALLY PROVIDE A ALMOST LIKE A BULLET POINTED LIST OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES. AND OF COURSE INVITE YOU -- TO FOR A DEEPER DISCUSSION ON ANY ONE OF THESE. SO ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT FIRES INCLUDE INVESTING OVER TIME IN MORE YEAR ROUND PERSONNEL AND AND EQUIPMENT FIRE ENGINES -- WE'VE BEGUN TO DO THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WITH THIRTEEN ENGINES AND ASSOCIATED PERSONALITIES PROPOSED BUDGET. CALIFORNIATRUSTSWOMEN STRATEGIC PLAN THAT ACTUALLY CALLS FOR A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WHAT OUR NEEDS THAT CAL FIRE SO THAT WE CAN REALLY RIGHT SIZE PERSONNEL WITH THE GROWING THREATS THAT WE FACE. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR OUR FLEET OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S AN AIRCRAFT'S INCLUDING REPLACING VIETNAM ERA HELICOPTERS WITH THE NEW STATE OF THE ART MORE EFFECTIVE HELICOPTERS. AND ENABLING THIS FLEET OF C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS -- THAT DROPPED BY RETARDANT ON ON THE FIRES. AND THEN WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. WHICH MANIFESTS IN RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU REPRESENT -- WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THOSE FIRE ENGINES ARE PRE POSITIONED FOR THE WILD FIRES THAT WILL FACE ACROSS THE STATE. SECOND CATEGORY HELPING COMMUNITIES BUILD THEIR RESILIENCE TO FIRE -- FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WE ALL CAN DO A BETTER JOB -- REALLY BUILDING AWARENESS AND CONTINUING TO ENFORCE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- AND THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY AWARENESS AND ENFORCEMENT BUT POTENTIALLY AT THE REPORT SUGGESTS. CONSIDERING UPDATING CODES THAT GOVERN DEFENSIBLE SPACE. WE NEED THE WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ENABLING COST EFFECTIVE -- HARDENING OF HOMES. CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT BUILDING CODES FOR NEW HOMES -- AS IT RELATES TO PROTECTING THOSE HOMES AGAINST BURNING UP IN A WILDFIRE. BUT OBVIOUSLY MOST OF THE HOMES IN THESE WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES -- OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE I HAVE ALREADY BEEN BUILT. AND SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON INCREASING OR EXPANDING PROGRAMS TO HELP -- HOMEOWNERS IN BONOBO COMMUNITIES HEART IN THEIR HOMES -- THROUGH ACTIVITIES LIKE ROOF REPLACEMENTS ARE CLOSING VANCE -- ETCETERA. I IN THE REPORT CALLS FOR CONSIDERATION OF A FUNDING MECHANISM. THAT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- TO IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY IN THEIR HOMES. WE ALSO IS THE REPORT -- POINTS OUT THAT NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO UPDATE AND STRENGTH AND LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS. EVACUATION ROUTES IDENTIFICATION OF ESSENTIALLY -- SAFE HAVENS IF RESIDENTS CAN'T EVACUATE. NE OF THE LESS TOLD STORIES OF PARADISE IS IT WAS ACTUALLY -- RELATIVELY -- WELL PREPARED TOWN AS IT RELATES TO CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE AND IT ACTUALLY DRILLED -- WITH ITS ITS RESIDENTS ON EVACUATION ROUTES. AND SOME ARGUE THAT FATALITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER HAD THOSE EVACUATION ROUTES NOT BEEN PRE PLANNED -- AND PRE COMMUNICATED WITH RESIDENTS. AND IF AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE HAD THERE NOT BEEN ESSENTIALLY CLEARANCE PROJECTS OF VEGETATION ON ON EITHER SIDE OF THOSE EVACUATION ROUTES. SO WE EED TO ENSURE THAT ALL VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE EMERGENCY PLANS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ACTUALLY I UNDERSTAND THOSE -- AND THAT THEIR INSTITUTIONALIZED -- AN UPDATED REGULARLY -- MORE CAN BE DONE TO ENHANCE COMMUNICATION A NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS -- AND THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT STATE STANDARDS SET ON THAT AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE STANDARDS. SO THAT -- IT RESIDENTS ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT FIRES -- FROM THEIR CELL PHONES OR IN WAYS -- THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE. AND THEN -- THE REPORT GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT -- IMPROVED LAND USE PRACTICES -- TO REDUCE FIRE THREATS -- CHANGING HOW HIGHER RISK AREAS ARE DESIGNED TO PLANNED BUILT AND SIR BY COMMUNITIES. AND SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW HOUSE TO DISCUSS THE SENSITIVE TOPIC OF APPROPRIATE GROWTH WHERE GROWTH SHOULD OCCUR. IS A DYNAMIC TENSION BECAUSE LAND USE AUTHORITY RESTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- BUT AS THE REPORT POINTS OUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO DISCUSS. REALLY HOW HOW TIME COMMUNITY SHOULD SHOULD GROW OUTWARD -- GIVEN THIS FIRE RISK -- AND THEN LASTLY -- CONTINUING HIGH AT TWO OF ALL HOW WE ASSESS BONE ABILITY OF OF OF COMMUNITIES. ARE THAT THAT CAL FIRE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT TOOK PHYSICAL FIRE RISK BUT THEN ALSO OVERLAID IT WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AT OUR CONCERTS CONSTRAINED BY EVACUATION ROUTES. AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE GIVEN DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE AGE AND INFIRMITY AND WE STE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH COMMUNITIES ARE MOST VULNERABLE. SO WE CAN FOCUS ON THOSE COMMUNITIES. THIRD AREA RECOMMENDATIONS IN SECTION ONE IMPROVING AND EXPANDING FORCE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH -- AS I TOLD IT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS I SHARED -- YOU KNOW THE FORCE LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT DID TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND WE NEED TO DO -- COLLECTIVELY A LOT MORE MANAGEMENT IN THE FOREST IN TERMS OF VEGETATION THEN WE HAVE IN THE PAST -- A LARGE PLAN IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CALLED THE FORCE CARBON PLAN CALLS MANAGEMENT A YEAR. AND THIS FORCE MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE APPROPRIATE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE LOGGING THIS IS. SCIENTIFICALLY DRIVEN FORCE MANAGEMENT -- THAT HELPS FOREST'S US STAY HEALTHY AND AND FIRE SAFE. THE GOOD NEWS IS SINCE TWENTY TEN WE'VE -- DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT WE ARE MANAGING AND TRIPLE THE AMOUNT THAT WERE WERE -- MANAGING BY PRESCRIBED FIRE THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GONNA MEET THAT CARBON THAT FORCED CARBON BY PLAN GOAL WE HAVE TO INCREASEBY TEN ACTS. OF THE AMOUNT OF OF LAND THAT WERE -- THAT WE'RE MANAGING YOU ALL HAVE LEAD CALLING FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN FORCE MANAGEMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- THE GOVERNOR HAS APPOINTED A NEW CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE -- SUPERVISOR FROM PLASTER COUNTY NAME JENNIFER MONTGOMERY WHO'S REALLY GOING TO DRIVE ACTION. TOWARDS THESE FORCE MANAGEMENT GOALS WHICH WILL INCLUDE -- WORKING WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS IN CREATING INCENTIVES TO ACTUALLY GET THIS FUEL OUT OF THE FOREST -- WHETHER IT'S BIO MASS OR THE MASS TIMBER INDUSTRY. OR ENVIRONMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ECONOMY -- THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO MANAGE FORESTS. AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK WE ACTUALLY AFTER A IMPROVING EXPAND WORKFORCE TRAINING WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO THIS WORK RIGHT NOW. I AM SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON ACTUALLY BUILDING UP THAT HUMAN CAPACITY -- IN OUR IN OUR TOWNS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH BY THE WAY CREATE A GREAT ECONOMIC. OPPORTUNITY. FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEN LASTLY AS IT RELATES TO FORCE MANAGEMENT HEALTH WE NEED TO REALLY STAND TOP OF THE BEST SCIENCE WE NEED TO DO THIS CAREFULLY -- THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS AND GROUPS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCALE OF FORCE MANAGEMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AND SO WE NEED TO ACTUALLY MANAGE FOREST AND TAKE SO CALLED FUEL OUT OF THE FOREST CAREFULLY. I IN A VOID IMPACTS -- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT ARE NEGATIVE. AND THEN THE FOURTH CATEGORY WHICH WILL PROBABLY SPEND MOST OF THE TIME TALKING ABOUT TODAY IT'S REALLY BUILDING SAFER UTILITIES AS IT RELATES TO WILD FIRE RISK. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ACCORDING TO DATA FROM CAL FIRE INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT 10% OF WILDFIRES -- IN CALIFORNIA ARE STARTED -- AS A RESULT OF ELECTRICAL IGNITIONS OR IGNITIONS FROM ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT BUT 10%. MOST OF THOSE WITHIN THAT 10% ARE ELECTRIC UTILITIES JUST BECAUSE UTILITIES HAVE MOST OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. SO OBVIOUSLY ONE IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF REDUCING WELFARE RISK IS. BUILDING SAFER UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFER UTILITY MANAGEMENT. THE I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE AREAS OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN SECTION ONE FIRST IS -- STRENGTHENING THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE FAIRLY NEW REQUIREMENT FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. BY CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN THOSE SO THAT I THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN ACTUALLY OVERSEE SAFETY PLANS FROM THE UTILITIES THAT ARE ADEQUATELY ROBUST TO ADDRESS THE THREAT. SECOND IS ENSURE THE UTILITIES ACTUALLY INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND MONITORING. MANY OF TALKED ABOUT THE THE WORK THAT SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC DID AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES I IN TERMS OF PROTECTIVE WHETHER A MONITORING. THAT HAVE REALLY PROVEN TO BE FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT UTILITY AS IT RELATES TO AVOIDING -- UTILITY CREATED FIRES. AND THEN LASTLY -- ANOTHER CATEGORY IN THE SECTION IS ALIGNING INCENTIVES FOR UTILITIES WITH SAFETY. IN OTHER WORDS CONDITIONING A RETURN ON IN EQUITY THAT THE C. P. U. C. ALLOW IS ON IT WITH WILD FIRE SAFETY PERFORMANCE -- SO THAT UTILITIES THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT REALLY. ARE REQUIRED -- TO DELIVER RATE PAYER -- INVESTOR BENEFIT ACTUALLY THE THEIR INCENTIVES FOR DOING SO RELY ON PROVIDING TOP SAFETY FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. HOW CLOSE BY JUST QUOTING THE ACTUAL THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE REPORT THAT I THINK CAPTURES WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE TODAY? IT SAYS WILDFIRE HAS ALWAYS PLAYED CALIFORNIA. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE FIRES HOTTER LARGER MORE FREQUENT AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. THE COST OF THESE FIRES IS UNBEARABLE. THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE PROPERTY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES COMMUNITY LIFE EXACERBATED BY THE COST TO REBUILD COMMUNITIES REBUILD COMMUNITIES CANNOT BE SUSTAINED. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT ENDS WITH SAYING THE STATUS QUO IS NOT AN OPTION. DOING NOTHING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO TIM WEIGHING THAN TO TAKE US THROUGH SECTION TO AND I KNOW. MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT YOU OF REALLY ASK FOR A FOCUS ON SECTION ONE IN THREE BUT WE WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT ON SECTION TO JUST OFFER CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. THERE ARE ENOUGH I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- NO MEMBERS HAD ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU AFTER. WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE THAT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM NOW OUR AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION? SIR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER. MISTER CRAWFORD -- YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE DOUBLE THE LANDOWNER MANAGEMENT FORCED AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS. YES SO CAL FIRE TRACKS THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE -- THAT IS THAT IS UNDER TREATMENT FOR VEGETATION IN OTHER WORDS REDUCING BRASCH IN SOME CASES SMALL DIAMETER TREES IN ORDER TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. HI AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TREAT WHAT WE CALL VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- HOVERED AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR -- RECENTLY AND I THINK BELIEVE -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIVE CAL FIRE WAS ABLE TO EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF OF ACRES ARE MANAGED GETTING THAT YOU KNOW DANGEROUS VEGETATION OUT WELL YOU KNOW MAINTAINING HEALTHY FORESTS. TO ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES. AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST CONTRAST THAT TO OUR GOAL WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. SO WHILE WE CAN YOU KNOW -- PROVIDE SOME CREDIT TO CAL FIRE FOR DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE WE'RE STILL WELL SHORT OF WHERE WE THINK WE NEED TO BE. ON THE ON THAT TOPIC. SO THEN THE ONE BILLION INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS RELATES TO JUST THESE ACRES -- NO WE HOPE TO THAT WE HOPE THAT THAT ONE BILLION SO FOR EXAMPLE. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE BUDGET ALLOCATES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR -- A LARGE PART OF IT GOES TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- WITH THESE THIRTY FIVE EMERGENCY PROJECTS WE WILL MANAGE OVER NINETY THOUSAND ACRES THIS YEAR -- AND WE ARE HOPING THAT THIS -- AMOUNT OF FUNDING THIS ONE BILLION DOLLARS AT THAT MANIFESTS OVER FIVE YEARS MOVES US TOWARD THAT GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES -- HOW HOW CLOSE WE GET TO THAT GOAL OR IF WE CAN SUPPRESS THE GOLD RELIES ON -- A LOT OF THE WORK THAT'S UNDER WAY BUT WE'RE GONNA HOPE TO GET THAT SORT OF MAXIMUM BANG FOR THE BUCK WITHOUT MONEY AS IT RELATES TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WITHIN THAT ACREAGE. WE'RE JUST MAKING A SMALL DENT ON WHAT WE OWN IS THE STATE. WELL I WOULD SAY -- WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A SMALL DENT WE INTEND IT WE INTEND TO DO MORE DO MORE BUT I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE. A CRITICAL PARTNER IN -- IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- NATIONAL FOREST -- SERVICE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I SHOULD SAY -- MANAGES ABOUT 57% OF OUR FOREST LANDS -- SO WE NEED TO DO OUR PART OF THE STATE WITH WITH GENERAL FUND OR RESOURCES FROM THE STATE BUDGET. WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR COMMERCIAL TIMBER OPERATORS -- TO CONTINUE TO DO THEIR PART WE NEED TO HELP STAND UP OTHER -- SECTORS AS I AS I MENTIONED -- SOME OF THIS STUFF FOREST FORCED BY PRODUCT SECTOR THIS MASS TIMBER ARE GOOD CROSS LIMITED TIMBER INDUSTRY THAT CAN ACTUALLY USE SMALLER PERMIT A SMALLER TREE PERIMETER AND SLASH. FOR FOR US YOU KNOW TO POTENTIALLY BUILD PRODUCTS -- SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC FUNDING STATE FUNDING FEDERAL FUNDING -- PRIVATE SECTOR YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL OPERATORS RIGHT NOW AND THEN HOPEFULLY NEW SECTORS INCLUDING BIOENERGY. FOR THE STATE OF UTAH IS SOMEHOW WORKING ON A PROJECT TO TRANSFER LAND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE OF UTAH ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL. NO. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON ON DEEPENING THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FOR SERVICE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE REALLY STRONG PARTNERS IN THE REGIONAL FORESTER AND THE THE DIFFERENT -- NATIONAL FOREST WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PARTNERS IN THE FOR SERVICE THAT ARE. I BELIEVE ARE ARE WELL ALIGNED WITH OUR GOALS. THEY'RE LOOKING AT SOME INTERESTING INNOVATION IN THE WAY THEY MANAGE THEIR LANDS TO REALLY SCALE THIS UP AS WELL THEIR GOAL IS ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK MEASURE JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE MISS CRAWFORD -- I I DID I DIDN'T GET THE FIRST PART OF THE THE CONVERSATION THERE IN THE IN THE IN RESPONSE TO HIS QUESTION. ART IS THE CONCERN OVER INVITE WE KNOW THAT WE DON'T NEED WE DON'T WANT TO TRAMPLE ON OUR ENVIRONMENT WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACKWARDS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW WE HAVE THESE CRITICAL THE ACTION NOT PART OF THE REASON WHY WE WERE ONLY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES. OKAY. MENTIONED THAT HE ARE. THEY CAL FIRE AND THE BOARD OF FORESTRY ARE DEVELOPING A A PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT -- ESSENTIALLY TO PROVIDE PROGRAMMATIC CLEARANCE TO VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS -- THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS AND SEE CA BUT I DO I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THAT WE WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW WE'RE CONSTRAINED AT THIS LEVEL AS A RESULT OF THAT -- WE CAN PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT WHILE MANAGING OUR FORESTS THANK YOU CENTER HILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SECURING THANK YOU AND THE PROGRAM FOR ORGANIZING AND PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THANK THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THE LEADERSHIP BE SHOWN. THE QUALITY OF THE WORK THAT CAME OUT OF THE STRIKE FORCE IN THE THE THE THE REPORT THAT WE'VE GIVEN I DID I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH IT SO THANK YOU. A QUESTION IN THE REPORTS VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND BRING FORWARD A LOT OF VERY THOUGHTFUL IDEAS AND AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH BUT I'M CURIOUS. I THINK THE AND THE THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED THERE'S A THIRTEEN NINETY DAY KIND OF GUIDE POST HERE AND WE'RE TASK I THINK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT WINDOW OF NINETY DAYS TO ACCOMPLISH. SOMETHING IN THAT THE IN THAT -- THAT TIME FRAME BUT UP. WHICH OF THE ACTIONS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT TO ME AND THERE MANY IN MASSIVE WHICH ONES WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT OR HOW SHOULD WE PRIORITIZE THOSE IN AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE GOVERNOR AND THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS IS GERMANE TO SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL ADDRESS HERE. AS AS IT RELATES-- TO OUT WILDFIRE LIABILITY FINANCIAL LIABILITY AND UTILITY UTILITY RESTRUCTURING. I IN TERMS OF WHAT I JUST PRESENTED ON I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE ANY ACTION POSSIBLE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES. THIS YEAR FROM WILDFIRE THREATS. I AND THAT'S WHY THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS FOCUS ON THE THE FUEL BREAKS AROUND THE COMMUNITIES. ON THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW UNDER THE UNDER THE UNDER THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION -- THROUGH VEHICLES LIKE SB NINE A ONE IN THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION WE'RE DOING THAT -- AND WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A A STRONG PLAN IN PLACE TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES A SUMMER THROUGH CAL FIRE. IN WILL GET THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON THIS YEAR THAN WE DID -- ONLY LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF OF THESE ACTIONS -- BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS A GOOD ONE TO SORT OF KEEP TOP OF MIND AS WE TALK THROUGH THESE OTHER PIECES OF THE REPORT. KEEP UP THIS WAY WHAT YOU -- PROCEED ON ON YOUR PART AND THEN WILL -- TAKE SOME QUESTIONS RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY. CLINTON L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G FROM PHIL SINGER&lt;/c&gt; ENERGY PARTNERS OR FTP. WE ARE A BOUTIQUE CONSULTING FIRM SPECIALIZING IN THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY -- WE'RE WORKING WITH -- GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE TO PERFORM RISK AND RATE ANALYSIS AND TO EVALUATE MARKET REFORMS. I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT PART TWO OF THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE REPORT. SUPPORT TO THE REPORT MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES. IS IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF CALIFORNIA'S RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WHICH REINFORCES THE NEED TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAINTAIN RELIABILITY AND REASONABLE ENERGY COSTS. THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCES REAFFIRMING CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM GOAL OF ACHIEVING CLEAN CARBON FREE ENERGY. THE TARGETS ARE TO INCREASE THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD TWENTY THIRTY AND TO ACHIEVE TWENTY FORTY FIVE TO DATE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS TOWARD THESE GOALS. AS OF LAST YEAR A THIRD OF THE RETAIL ELECTRIC SALES WITHIN THE STATE CAME FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE SALES ARE FROM CARBON FREE RESOURCES WHICH INCLUDE HYDROELECTRIC AND NUCLEAR ENERGY. IN ADDITION THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY HAS GREATLY BENEFITED CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. TO DATE IT HAS CREATED OVER HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS WITHIN THE STATE AND ATTRACTED OVER SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS. WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH MORE IN THE FUTURE. GOING FORWARD THE STATE NEEDS TO BE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO FIZZLE TO FACILITATE INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MEET ITS AMBITIOUS GOALS. WHILE ENSURING RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND RELIABILITY. ON THE PAST 2100% CLEAN ENERGY A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES HAVE TO BE OVERCOME. THE MARKET HAS CHANGED AS TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED AND RENEWABLE ENERGY COSTS HAVE DECLINED. NEW ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS HAVE EMERGED IN THE FORM OF ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION IS ALSO GAINING MARKET SHARE. THE RESULT IS THAT THE ELECTRICITY MARKETS HAVE BECOME MORE FRAGMENTS. AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING POLES AND WIRES COMPANIES. THAT IS THEIR RETAINING THE ELECTRICITY DELIVERY FUNCTION AND TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM RETAIL SALES OF ELECTRICITY. WITHIN THE WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET RELIABILITY AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY CHALLENGES MAY ARISE. AS RENEWABLES GAIN EVER GREATER MARKET SHARE THE GREETED WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THEIR GENERATION. NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATION CURRENTLY PROVIDES RELIABILITY AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY SERVICES -- BUT AS CALIFORNIA. APPROACH IS A 100% CLEAN ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATION IS REPLACED BY RENEWABLES. NEW TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WILL PLAY A GREATER ROLE. THE SOLUTIONS MAY INCLUDE TIME OF USE RATES -- DEMAND RESPONSE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. INCREASED REGIONAL COORDINATION. ELECTRIC VEHICLE INTEGRATION AND ELECTRICITY STORAGE. THEY'RE ALSO CHALLENGES THE RETAIL ELECTRICITY MARKET -- CURRENTLY THE CUSTOMER CHOOSES NOT TO OBTAIN SERVICE FROM COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS. WORK THOSE PROVIDERS FAIL -- THEY CAN OBTAIN SERVICE FROM AN I. O. U. AS A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. IF I USE BECOME POLES AND WIRES COMPANIES THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. AND AN ALTERNATE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WILL HAVE TO BE DESIGNATED. A DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES SUCH AS ROOFTOP SOLAR ARE GAINING MARKET SHARE THESE RESOURCES ARE DESIRABLE BUT THEY ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE GRID OPERATOR LIKE TRADITIONAL GENERATORS. THE OPERATION OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES WILL HAVE TO BE INCREASINGLY MANAGED AND INTEGRATED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SYSTEM RELIABILITY. A PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY DEMAND RESPONSE. ARE PART OF THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. AND CALIFORNIA HELP WILL HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE MAINTAINED WHILE THE ROLE OF THE I. O. U.'S EVOLVE. IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION ALSO NEED TO BE DE CARBONIZED. VEHICLES BURNING GASOLINE AND DIESEL CURRENTLY COUNT FOR OVER A THIRD OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITHIN THE STATE -- CONVERTING THEM TO LECTURE CITY. IS THE BEST WAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY GENERATION. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAN ON THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS ADMINISTERED BY THE CPUC OR A SIMILAR FRAMEWORK. GAPS IN THE MARKETS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED. A POTENTIAL SOLUTION MAY BE A NEW STATE PROCUREMENT ENTITY. THAT CAN ENTER INTO LONG TERM CONTRACTS IF I USE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND ENERGY SERVICE PRIDE PROVIDERS CANNOT. THE STATE PROCUREMENT ENTITY COULD ALSO PROVIDE CREDIT SUPPORT. SO THAT OTHER ENTITIES CAN PURCHASE A TEMPERATURE NEEDED RESOURCES [inaudible] THROUGHOUT TRANSPARENCY IS CRITICAL. CUSTOMERS REGULATORS AND ENERGY PROVIDERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPOSITION OF ELECTRICITY. COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS. AND OTHER PROCUREMENT DATA TO IMPROVE DECISION MAKING. ACHIEVING THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS IS PARAMOUNT BUT CALIFORNIA MUST ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS. WHILE ENSURING RELIABILITY. MAINTAINING REASONABLE COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS AND REDUCING RISKS. THANK YOU. NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MS MITCHELL TO COVER PART. THREE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT YOU GO AHEAD OKAY GREAT. SO THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT TODAY. I NEED TO MITCHELL I'M A PARTNER AT THE LAW FIRM OF O'MELVENY MYERS AND TODAY I'M PRESENTING AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME STRIKE FORCE. MY PRESENTATION WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS OF THE REPORT. PART THREE WHICH IS ENTITLED TO FAIR ALLOCATION OF CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE DAMAGE. PART FOR ENTITLED A MORE EFFECTIVE CPUC. WITH TOOLS TO MANAGE AND CHANGING UTILITY MARKET. AND PART FIVE ENTITLED HOLDING P. JEANNIE ACCOUNTABLE AND BUILDING A UTILITY THAT PRIORITIZES SAFETY. SINCE MR WANG'S PRESENTATION ON PART TWO HIGHLIGHTED FOR THE COMMITTEE THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKET. AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT SECTION I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS PART FOR OF THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT WHICH FOCUSES ON THE REFORMS. TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO PARTS THREE AND PART FIVE WHICH I KNOW YOU WANTED TO FOCUS ON TODAY. AS PART OF THE PRESENTATION ON PART THREE MR BOLICK FROM PHIL SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS WILL ALSO PRESENT SOME DATA. ON MODELING THE SIZE OF A POTENTIAL WILDFIRE FUND WHICH IS SOME WORK THAT THE STRIKE FORCES DONE SINCE WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL REPORT. SO WITH REGARD TO PART. FOUR THE STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED IN PART FOUR OF THE REPORT THAT CPUC REFORM IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE CHANGING DYNAMICS OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKETS. THE REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE EVALUATE A COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL OF THE CPUC IN AN EFFORT TO SERVE IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. RECOGNIZING AND THAT SUCH AN OVERHAUL COULD BE A LONGER TERM PROCESS THE REPORT ALSO INCORPORATED SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEAR TERM ACTION. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE STRIKE FORCE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT CPUC PROCESS. THOSE ISSUES FALL ROUGHLY INTO THE FOLLOWING BUCKETS. THE FIRST BUDGET IS THE CPUC LACKS THE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO TO ADDRESS ITS CURRENT SCOPE. THE CBC'S HISTORIC FUNCTION HAS BEEN PRIMARILY AS A RATE SETTING BODY. AND RICH HISTORY THE CBC HAS DEVELOPED SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF RATE SETTING. BUT RECENTLY THE CPUC HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. AND ALSO ADDRESSING THE SAFETY ISSUES TO PREVENT WILDFIRES. AND THE CBC HAS REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITY FOR A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES NOT JUST THE ELECTRIC ENERGY SECTOR. AND AS ITS MANDATE HAS EXPANDED FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREAS OF SAFETY THE UNDERLYING EXPERTISE TO DECEIVE YOU SEE HAS DEVELOPED IS NOT KEPT UP WITH THAT EXPANSION. THE SECOND BUCKET OF ISSUES THAT THE REPORT IDENTIFIED. IS THE CP UC'S CHOIRS AYE JUDICIAL PROCESS WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY SUITABLE FOR ALL THE FUNCTIONS IT'S BEING ASKED TO PERFORM. THE CBC HAS AN APPROACH TO RESOLVING ISSUES THAT IS BECAUSE I JUDICIAL IN NATURE IT'S A HIGHLY STRUCTURED LEGAL PROCESS THAT INCORPORATES ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES SUBSTANTIAL PLEADINGS INSUBSTANTIAL HEARINGS. THAT PROCESS. POTENTIALLY VERY WELL SUITED TO TRADITIONAL MARIE RATE MAKING IS NOT NIMBLE OR FLEXIBLE AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEND ITSELF TO POLICY MAKING FUNCTIONS OR RAPIDLY CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES. THE THIRD A BUCKET OF ISSUES THAT THE REPORT IDENTIFIED WITH THE CP UC'S CURRENT PROCESS. IS THAT THE CB USY HAS SOME ILL DEFINED AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING MANDATES. THIS CD UC HAS ALWAYS HAD TO BALANCE THE OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WITH ITS NEED TO ENSURE FINANCIALLY HEALTHY UTILITIES THAT CAN MEET CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS. THE EXPANSION OF THE C. B. UC'S ROLLS INTO AREAS SUCH AS SAFETY AND CLEAN ENERGY MEANS THAT THE CPUC IS ALSO TAKING ON A BECAUSE I POLICY MAKING FUNCTION IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS. AND THAT RESULTS IN A C. B. UC WITH A VERY BROAD BUT SOMEWHAT ILL DEFINED AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING SET OF MANDATES. HAVING IDENTIFIED THOSE PROBLEMS AND HAVING RECOMMENDED THE EVALUATION OF LONGER TERM AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. THE REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDED NEAR TERM THE FOLLOWING FOR ACTIONS. NUMBER ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO EXPAND TO THE SAFETY EXPERTISE AT THE CPUC. OR TO CREATE ANOTHER STATE AGENCY WITH THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE. THE SECOND. RECOMMENDED ACTION WAS AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO REFORMING THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT AS PART. THREE THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO THE CPUC ON OVERHAULING ITS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. TO ADDRESS SAFETY RELATED INITIATIVES AND COST RECOVERY ACTIONS IN THE AREA OF WILD FIRE DAMAGES. HAVING SAID THAT THE REPORT ALSO RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ANY OVERHAUL OF DECISION MAKING PROCESS STILL PROVIDE FOR APPROPRIATE PUBLIC INPUT AND TRANSPARENCY. BUT ALLOW IT TO BE DONE ON A MORE STREAMLINED BASIS. THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IN THE AREA OF CEBU SEE REFORM WAS THAT THE CPUC WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. TO IDENTIFY HIGH RISK INDUSTRY REGULATORY MODELS FOR EXAMPLE IN AVIATION. THAT COULD PROVIDE A BASIS FOR LONGER TERM REFORM. AND FOURTH THAT THE CBC DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR UTILITIES THEY CAN BE A RESOURCE ON ISSUES SUCH AS CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AS TO THIS FOURTH RECOMMENDATION THE CBC HAS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. THAT THAT SORT OF A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PART FOR SENATOR DOT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO MOVE TO PART. THREE SIR HILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I COULD GO ON IN TERMS OF THE AND THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CQC HAS AND AND I THINK WE'VE RECOGNIZE THOSE AND IT'S NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. IT TO A LARGE EXTENT IT'S THE RESOURCES THEY POINT TO CHIU SO ACCURATELY -- CONVEYED ONE OF THE ISSUES THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE QUASI JUDICIAL ROLE. OF THAT THE FEW SHE HAS THAT COULD CHANGE THAT NOW THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING LEGISLATIVELY SO -- SO YOU THEM WHEN AND WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE BUT BABY ALASKA THE COMMISSIONERS HERE ON THAT BUT THEY DO HAVE THAT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THERE WAS ALSO IN THE REPORTED TALKED ABOUT -- TO CULTURE DELEGATING MORE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO STAFF -- IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT THAT YOU HAVE WHAT KIND WHAT TYPE OF AUTHORITY THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE REPORT THAT YOU WOULD THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE OF SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE CPUC PROCESS MOST OF THE AUTHORITY RESIDES IN THE ALE J. AND THEN IN THE COMMISSIONER WHOSE. AND IN CHARGE AND THERE MAY BE AND THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING I THINK PROBABLY BETTER DISCUSSED WITH THE CPC BUT THERE MAY BE WAYS THAT. THAT THEIR PROCESS COULD BE IN PART STREAMLINED BY DELEGATING MORE FUNCTIONS TO THE CPUC STAFF PARTICULARLY IF YOU DEVELOP EXPERTISE IN THE SAFETY AREA. I MEAN THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE AND AND FEW YEARS AGO WE DID GIVE THAT AUTHORITIES TO FIND SIDE AND FIND. A THORNY FOR THOSE MINOR VIOLATIONS BUT I THINK THAT YOU'RE RIGHT WILL TAKE IT UP WITH THEM TO SEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FUTURE. YOUR HONOR OVER TO ME. OKAY SIR MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MISTER MISS MITCHELL SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE CPUC I'M JUST WONDERING -- IF IT'S JUST SO MONOLITHIC THAT THAT IT NEEDS MORE THAN WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN UP INTO SMALLER UNITS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. SO SO TO BE CLEAR I'M HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STRIKE FORCE AND I HATE I DON'T MEAN TO BE COMPLEMENTARY OR OTHERWISE I WAS TRYING TO REPORT ON WHAT THE STRIKE FOR SUGGESTED. I THINK THAT AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS THE STRIKE FORCE REALLY LEFT IT TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO THE LEGISLATURE AND AND YOU'RE GOOD POLICY MAKING SKILLS TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. FOR THAT SI PC. WELL I'M NOT TRYING TO KILL THE MESSENGER I AM. I'M JUST TRYING. TO MAYBE PRIDE A LITTLE BIT AND SAY HEY YOU YOU HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE MORE I LOOK AT THE CPUC IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO COVER SO MUCH TERRITORY. AND IT WAS SO MANY INDUSTRIES AND IT KEEPS GROWING AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF. YOU KNOW USUALLY USING THE WORD REFORM BUT I'M I I'M WONDERING IF RESTRUCTURING AND RE. REORGANIZING AND AND SPLITTING IT UP INTO MORE FOCUSED. DIVISIONS WOULD BE A BETTER APPROACH SO I THINK THAT THE REPORT WAS FAIRLY CLEAR ON THE ISSUE THAT THE BREADTH AND SCOPE OF WHAT THE CPUC IS TRYING TO DO IS IS VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN ITS CURRENT. CURRENT RESOURCES AND CONFIGURATION. HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING THAT REFORM? I'M A BANKRUPTCY LAWYER I'M BIG ON RESTRUCTURING THINGS BUT I I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TO DO THAT PART OF IT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE REPORT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE REPORT WAS. WITH THANKS FOR YOUR POLITE AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE. THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY -- MR MALIKI WANTED -- I THINK I'M I'M STARTING PART THREE IF THAT'S OKAY SENATOR DODD AND THEN AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER. TO TO MISTER POLLOCK WHAT WHAT WHAT SECOND. IF I MAY BEFORE WE GET TO SECTION THREE I'D LIKE IF I COULD TO TO GO BACK. TO SOME OF THE THE POINTS THE OBSERVATIONS YOU MADE ABOUT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IN THE STATE. AND AS I WAS GOING THROUGH MY LIST OF LEGISLATION THAT WE DID LAST YEAR SB NINE A ONE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT I DID TO TALK ABOUT THINNING -- MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO -- THE KINDS OF VEGETATION IN FUEL MANAGEMENT -- WORKING WITH CAL FIRE THESE ARE THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PASSING ALREADY BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO WELL I APPRECIATE IDENTIFYING -- THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST WE HAVE I THINK TO A LARGE EXTENT STARTED WORKING ON THOSE THINGS THROUGH POLICY SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES -- IS THERE GOING TO BE FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET I'M NOT TRYING TO YOU KNOW GET A SNEAK PREVIEW BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF THIS WORK. IS READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED WE HAVE DONE THE POLICY CAL FIRE NOW AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY THE HARDENING -- AND THE PLANNING THAT NEED TO BE DONE FOR ALL THOSE HOMES IN THE WILL WE AS YOU SAY AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH EGRESS INGRESS AND Là PARADISE. SO THOSE THINGS ARE BEING DONE AS WE SPEAK THE QUESTION IS IS THERE GOING TO BE FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WHICH ARE BOTH BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS REPORT AND ALSO ADDRESSED TO SOME EXTENT -- THROUGH LEGISLATION. THAT WE ARE -- UNDERTOOK LAST YEAR IN RESPONDING TO THESE FIRES SO WHAT IS SO I GUESS QUESTIONS WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S OF FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE. ONE EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE -- AS BEFORE SIXTY FIVE I THINK IS A BILL I DID LAST YEAR TO GIVE. PEOPLE MONEY TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES THROUGH THE PACE PROGRAM IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT IT'S A START ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE THINGS TO DO YOU HAVE SOME PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL BE PRESENTING EITHER THROUGH THE BUDGET. OR THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US AS POLICY MAKERS -- INTRODUCED TO TO EFFECTUATE THESE SUGGESTIONS. IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK YOU RAISE A VERY GOOD POINT WHICH IS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST TWO TO THREE YEARS HAS PROVIDED YOU KNOW AGENCIES A LOT OF AUTHORITY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THESE FRONTS ONE AREA -- THAT COMES TO MIND FOR ME AS PRESCRIBED FRE. NAM THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A CHALLENGE -- WE KNOW IT MAKES SENSE TO DO TO AVOID MEGA FIRES BUT THERE ARE A RANGE OF OF OF REGULATORY AND TURN A BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGES WITH THAT -- AND SO LEGISLATION HAS HAS CLEARED THE WAY FOR US T MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS SO YOU KNOW ONE POINT TAKEN. WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THESE LAWS I AND THEN TO THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR THIS -- YOU REYES HOME HARDENING -- AND I WOULD AGREE THAT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE -- HELP IN PEOPLE IN THESE VOLATILE COMMUNITIES AFFORD HOME HARDENING -- HOME HARDENING YOU KNOW IS NOT CHEAP -- THERE ARE AFFORDABLE THINGS THAT CAN GET DONE BUT THEY NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. YOU REYES PACE AS AN EXAMPLE AND I THINK BASED ON THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ON PACE I WAS TOLD THIS WEEK THAT ACTUALLY THAT'S THAT'S ESSENTIALLY GET GETTING PUT IN PLACE WHERE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT PROPERTY SAYS CLEAN ENERGY FINANCING. FOR HOME HARDENING I'M SO WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS -- AS IT RELATES TO THE BUDGET AND RESOURCES I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I'LL BRING THAT POINT BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. TO ENSURE THAT -- ALL OF THIS WORK IS GETTING FUNDED ADEQUATELY THANK YOU. OKAY. SO PART THREE OF THE REPORT. I'M THIS STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED IN PART THREE OF THE REPORT THAT A NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS WILDFIRE LIABILITIES IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED RISK IN MAGNITUDE OF FIRES. THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MITIGATION EFFORTS. THE APPLICABLE CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE FINANCIAL STRESS ON THE UTILITIES SECTOR. THE REPORT IDENTIFIED SEVEN PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD GUIDE ANY SOLUTION AND CAREFULLY EVALUATED VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR A NEW POLICY FRAMEWORK. THE REPORT ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED THE THREE APPROACHES THAT THE STRIKE FORCE BELIEVES MERIT FURTHER CONSIDERATION. THE REPORT DID NOT SELECT AN APPROACH BUT RATHER IDENTIFIED IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NEED TO ANSWER BEFORE SELECTING AN APPROACH. BEFORE MOVING INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I WANTED TO IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE A FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE UNDERLYING THE REPORT. AND THAT IS THAT STABLE WELL MANAGED AND INVESTABLE UTILITIES A BENEFIT CALIFORNIA. AND BY INVESTABLE I MEAN THEY CAN ATTRACT CAPITAL THE MARKET AT REASONABLE PRICES. RECOGNIZING THE SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT THAT WILL DEAL WITH MORE IN PART FIVE OF THE REPORT. THE REPORT NOTES THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN CRITICAL PLAYERS IN ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND IN MAINTAINING A SAFE AND RELIABLE SYSTEM. MOREOVER UTILITIES THAT ARE NOT FINANCIALLY STABLE OR NOT INVESTABLE MAY HAVE REAL FINANCIAL COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. ALL THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES A RECENTLY REQUESTED IN FOR GORE CPUC FILINGS INCREASED RETURN ON EQUITY. IN THE RANGERS 14216% WHICH IS SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FROM WHERE THERE ARE -- HE IS TODAY. I'M AND MOST OF THEM JUSTIFIED THOSE REQUESTS BASED ON SUBSTANTIAL WILD FIRE RISK PREMIUMS. NOT INVISIBLE UTILITIES ALSO HAVE HIGHER BORROWING COSTS. ON AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOSE INCREASES IN IN OUR WE ARE IN FOR OUR APPROVED IN THE NEAR TERM. THE RECENT FILINGS PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR YOU FOR THE POTENTIAL COSTS TO CONSUMERS IF A NEW LIABILITY FRAMEWORK IS AND PUT IN PLACE. WITH THAT SAID THE STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED THAT ANY REFORM OF THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK NEEDED TO BE GROUNDED IN SEVEN PRINCIPLES. NUMBER ONE MAINTAINING SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER. NUMBER TWO HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY. NUMBER THREE TREATING WILD FIRE VICTIMS FAIRLY. NUMBER FOUR REQUIRING EQUITABLE STAKEHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS. NUMBER FIVE REDUCING OVERALL COSTS OF BOTH THE FIRES IN THE CLAIMS THAT ARISE FROM THEM. BUT BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE A FREE RIDER PROBLEM OR CREATING AN APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE NOT TO ACT RESPONSIBLY. NUMBER SIX PROMOTING CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND NUMBER SEVEN RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF TAX PAYERS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE COST OF MITIGATING FIRE RISK IN FIGHTING FIRES AS AND WHEN THEY IGNITE. THE REPORT SPEND SUBSTANTIAL TIME ON THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO WILDFIRE LIABILITY COST RECOVERY STANDARDS THE RECENT APPLICATION OF THOSE STANDARDS SENATE BILL NINE A ONE AND ITS AFTERMATH. AND THE CURRENT STATE OF THE INSURANCE MARKET AND WHILE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THAT. I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH THAT BACKGROUND IN DETAIL I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PROBABLY HAVE A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAN ANYONE SITTING UP HERE -- THE REPORT IDENTIFIED THREE CONCEPTS AS WORTHY OF FURTHER CONSIDERATION. BY THE POLICY MAKERS. THE FIRST CONCEPT WAS A LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND LIABILITY UNDER ADVERSE CONDEMNATION TO A FAULT BASED STANDARD. AND THE THIRD CONCEPT WAS A LARGER WILDFIRE OR CATASTROPHIC WELFARE FUNDS. I WOULD NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT THESE CONCEPTS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OR NECESSARILY STANDALONE CONCEPTS WELL I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE CONCEPTS WANTING CONCEPTS THREE IS TO SEPARATE FUNDS. THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER COMBINING CERTAIN CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTING FEATURES THAT WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT FROM ONE COM SET CONCEPT TO ANOTHER. I'M ALSO BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAIN IMPACT OF ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVES ON THE INSURANCE MARKETS. THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO ABOUT EVALUATE POLICY OPTIONS TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY OF INSURANCE DEPENDING ON WHICH OPTION YOU WOULD SELECT. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT EACH OF THESE ALTERNATIVES ASSUMES A REGULATORY REFORM IN THE FURTHER IN THE FORM OF FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF COST RECOVERY STANDARDS. AND MODIFICATION OF POTENTIAL STREAMLINING OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS. THE STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED THAT SOME DEGREE OF REGULATORY REFORM IS NECESSARY IN ANY OF THE CONCEPTS THAT WERE PUT FORTH IN THE REPORT. IF THE CONCEPTS ARE GOING TO STABILIZE THE UTILITIES AND PUT THE UTILITIES IN A POSITION TO FINANCE THEIR CAPITAL NEEDS. AT A REASONABLE COST. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR POLICY MAKERS TO CONSIDER THAT ANY CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. AND ANY INCREASED CERTAINTY ON COST RECOVERY HAS AN ATTENDANT IMPACT ON REPAIRS. AND SO REGULATORY REFORM NEEDS TO BE BALANCED IN TERMS OF WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR INVESTABLE UTILITIES AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT REGULATORY REFORM WOULD HAVE ON REPAIRS. EACH OF THE CONCEPTS HAS BENEFITS IN TRADE OFFS IN THE CASE OF A FUN STRUCTURE AT LEAST ONE THAT REQUIRES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM UTILITY INVESTORS. ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES IS THAT THE INVESTOR CONTRIBUTION IS LIKELY TO COME WITH CONDITIONS. ARE TYPICALLY OR EXPECTEDLY REQUIRING MORE DEFINITIVE AND POTENTIALLY UNCAPPED COST RECOVERY STANDARDS THAT COULD SHIFT FUTURE COSTS TO REPAIRS. AND OR LEAVE FEWER FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PAY WILD FIRE DAMAGE CLAIMS. SO WITH THAT LET ME BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE THREE CONCEPTS THAT WERE IN THE REPORT. THE LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE INVEST ABILITY OF UTILITIES BY PROVIDING ESSENTIALLY BRIDGE FINANCING OUR LIQUIDITY FINANCING. FOR UTILITIES TO PAY WILD FIRE CLAIMS PENDING THE C. P. UC'S DECISION ON COST RECOVERY. THE IDEA IS TO ADDRESS THE TIMING PROCESS THAT EXIST IN THE EXIT IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OF THE LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND IS TO STABILIZE THE CREDIT RATINGS OF UTILITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS CAPITAL TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS. THAT BENEFITS REPAIRS BY KEEPING THE COST OF BORROWING AND R. O. E. RELATIVELY LOW. SOME FEATURES OF THE LIQUIDITY FUND THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. THE REPORT IDENTIFIED THAT FUNDING COULD BE PROVIDED BY A UTILITY INVESTORS OR RATE PAYERS OR COMBINATION. ONE SOURCE OF POTENTIAL FUNDING THAT THE REPORT CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL CONTINUATION OR SECURITIZATION OF THE STREAM OF REVENUE THAT'S CURRENTLY KNOWN AS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ARE D. W. R. CHARGE. ONCE THOSE BONDS ARE TO FEES THAT CHARGE COULD IN THEORY CONTINUE AND BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE FUND WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PAY CLAIMS BEFORE COST RECOVERY DETERMINATION THIS GOES TO THE ISSUE OF CREATING LIQUIDITY BY pONCE THAT COST RECOVERY DETERMINATION WAS MADE THEN THE FUND WOULD BE REIMBURSED IF THE COST RECOVERY DETERMINATION WAS THAT UTILITY HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY. THAN THAT REIMBURSEMENT WILL COME FROM REPAIRS. IF THE UTILITY HAD NOT ACTED PRUDENTLY THEN IT WOULD COME FROM UTILITY INVESTORS IN BOTH CASES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE FUND WOULD GET MONEY BACK IN SO IT WOULD JUST HAVE PROVIDE IT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THE TIMING ISSUE. BECAUSE THE DRAWS WOULD BE REIMBURSED AND THE SIZE OF THE FUND THAN IS LIKELY TO BE MORE LIMITED IT'S LESS LIKELY TO BE DEPLETED. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REVOLVING SOURCES OF FUNDING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS CONCEPT DOES NOT SHIELD EITHER UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS OR LIQUID OR UTILITY CUSTOMERS FROM ON CAP LIABILITY FOR WILD FIRE DAMAGES IT ADDRESSES THE TIMING RISK. THE SECOND CONCEPT IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT WOULD INVOLVE CHANGING STRICTLY ABILITY TO A FAULT BASED STANDARD. APPLICATION OF A FAULT BASED STANDARD IS INTENDED TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS CASE AN ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. WITH THE PRIVATE HARM TO INDIVIDUALS A CAGE OCCASION BY THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. THIS CHANGE WOULD IMPACT ONLY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGES SENSE CALIFORNIA GENERALLY ALREADY APPLIES A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD TO PERSONAL INJURY WRONGFUL DEATH AND OTHER TORT CLAIMS. MOVING TO FALL BASE STANDARD HAS THE IMPACT OF SHIFTING THE RISK OF PROPERTY LOSS TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. AN UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE CASE WHERE THE UTILITY IS NOT A BAD ACTOR. IF YOU TELL THE IS AT FAULT INCLUDING FOR NEGLIGENT RECKLESS OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAN UTILITY WOULD STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE DAMAGES INCLUDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE THIRD CONCEPT IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT IS WHAT WE DESCRIBE AS A WILDFIRE FUND WHICH IS A WELL CAPITALIZED FUND THAT WOULD CREATE A BUFFER TO ABSORB A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY COSTS. THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PASSED ON TO REPAIRS UNDER EXISTING LAW WHAT PROVIDING TIME FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS TO BE ADVANCED. THE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS FUND AND THE LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND. IS AT THE WILD FIRE FUND BOTH ADDRESSES LIQUIDITY ISSUES AND ALSO IT TENDS TO LIMIT THE COST TO REPAIR IS BY BUILDING UP A LIABILITY TOWER. THAT THAT GOES FIRST TO FUNDS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY UTILITIES. THE REPAIR SAVINGS ARISE BECAUSE THE UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS CONTRIBUTING NON RECOVERABLE DEPOSIT TO THE FUND WHICH WOULD PAY CLAIMS FOR COST RECOVERY. OR WOULD PAY CLAIMS WHICH COST RECOVERY WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO LARGE THE SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTION. THE GREATER THE REPAIR SAVINGS ARE THE BUFFER BECAUSE THERE'S A SOURCE OF FUNDS TO PAY THOSE BEFORE YOU GO TO REPAIRS. LIKE A LIQUIDITY FUND THE WILDFIRE FUND PROVIDES A SOURCE OF IMMEDIATE FUNDING FOR CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST THE UTILITIES AND FOR CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE DAMAGES. SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE WILD FIRE FUND CONSIDERED IN THE REPORT IN YOUR ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT. INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING. UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUNDS CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES. IN ADDITION THE FUNDS CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES COULD BE ENHANCED TO SOMETHING LIKE THE EXTENSION OF THE D. W. ARE CHARGED THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. INSURERS WOULD ACCEPT THE CAP ON SUBROGATION CLAIMS IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE FUND. THE CPUC WOULD BE ABLE TO RETAIN JURISDICTION TO IMPOSE PENALTIES ON UTILITIES THAT DO NOT ACT PRUDENTLY BUT IN THE REPORT BEYOND THE CBC PENALIZING THEM THE FUND WAS LARGELY A NO FAULT. FUND. ON THE FUND COULD PULL CAPITALS FROM ALL I USE. MUNICIPAL UTILITIES COULD PARTICIPATE AT THEIR OPTION. THE FUND COULD BE LIMITED TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HOWEVER YOU DEFINE DID IN THE LEGISLATION. AND THE FUND COULD IF DESIRED USE A TRUST FOR ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS TO SPEED UP RECOVERY NOT AS I INDICATED AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS SOME OF THOSE. FEATURES COULD BE IMPORTED ANOTHER FUND STRUCTURES BUT THOSE WERE THE THINGS THAT OR OR DROPPED ALTOGETHER BUT BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. THIS CONCEPT ALSO DOES NOT SHIELD UTILITY CUSTOMERS FROM ON CAP MY ABILITY FOR WILD FIRE DAMAGES IT JUST CREATES A BUFFER LAYER THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE UTILITIES PROVIDED CONTRIBUTION UP FRONT -- AND THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE. ONCE THE FUND IS EXHAUSTED IF THE UTILITY CONTRIBUTION COMES WITH THE CHANGING COST RECOVERY STANDARDS THEN IT MAY BE THAT REPAIRS ACTUALLY PAY MORE ONCE THE FUND IS EXHAUSTED SO THE SIZE OF THE FUND BECOMES IMPORTANT -- ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT. THERE REALLY ISN'T THE WILDFIRE DAMAGE THAT YOU EXPECT AND YOU RAISE THE FUNDSAND THEN. REPAIRS MAY HAVE PAID FOR SOMETHING THEY DON'T NEED -- THE REPORT IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS QUESTIONS FOR EVALUATION BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE IN. IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH OF THESE OPTIONS. I'M NOT GONNA BE THE MALL BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF PAGES BUT IN THE FUND'S STRUCTURE THERE WERE SOME CRITICAL ONES THAT I THINK POLICYMAKERS REALLY NEED TO CONSIDER I DEVELOPING A FUND ONE OF THEM AND IT'S WHAT MR BOLICK WILL SPEAK TO IN A MINUTE. IS HOW BIG DOES THE FUND HAVE TO BE IN ORDER TO MEET ITS STATED GOAL. GENERALLY IN MY REMARKS LIQUIDITY FUND IS SMALLER THAN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE FUND I'M A LAWYER THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS I DO WITH NUMBERS. BUT IT IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT THING IN FUND DESIGNED TO THINK ABOUT HOW BIG IT IS. WHAT IN WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON REPAIRS IN EACH OF THESE ALTERNATIVES UNDER VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE THE IMPACT ON REPAIRS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON? THE SIZE OF THE FUND HOW MUCH THE UTILITY FUNDING IS BUT ALSO HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK. THE MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE GOING TO WORK AND HOW MUCH ANNUAL WILD FIRE DAMAGES ARE GOING TO BE AN AND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR THOSE MITIGATION EFFORTS TO WORK. SO ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU DEVELOP YOUR FUND DESIGN -- WELL THE FUND SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO STABILIZE RATINGS AND HELP WITH THE PERCEPTION OF UTILITIES CREDIT QUALITY. IF THE FOR IF THE RATING AGENCIES AND THE INVESTORS DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION THAN. WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM WHAT SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTION WOULD YOU REQUIRE TO CAPITALIZE THE FUND. HOW DO YOU DESIGN A FUND TO CREATE THE PROPER INCENTIVES FOR UTILITIES TO INVEST IN? SAFETY AND PREVENTION MEASURES NOT CREATE A FREE RIDER OR A MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM. HOW IS P. JEANNIE GOING TO RAISE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MAKE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUND TO GIVEN THAT IT'S IN BANKRUPTCY? AND THE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY FUND ACTUALLY TIED TO P. JEANNIE EXITING FROM BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THAT HAS A TIMING ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO THOSE ARE SOME CRITICAL ISSUES. THAT THE STRIKE FORCE IDENTIFIED AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONTINUING WORK DONE ON SOME OF THOSE. THERE WAS ALSO FURTHER RESEARCH OBVIOUSLY ON A CHAIR ON ALTERNATIE TO YOU WHICH IS A THE CHANGE TO A FULL BASED SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS IS HOW MUCH WOULD MOVING TO A FAULT BASED SYSTEM ACTUALLY REDUCE THE SETTLEMENTS THAT UTILITIES WOULD. PAY FOR WILD FIRE CLAIMS -- AND THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED IS WITH THIS APPROACH TO YIELD THE CERTAINTY NEEDED FOR THE CAPITAL MARKETS PARTICULARLY GIVEN POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS AND CHALLENGES THAT I THINK YOU ALL ARE VERY AWARE OF WITH REGARD TO CHANGE TO A FAULT BASED SYSTEM. SO WITH THAT THAT THOSE ARE MY REMARKS ON PART THREE I THINK MISTER POLLOCK IS GOING TO PROVIDE YOU SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL WORK AND THAT THE STRIKE FORCE HAS DONE. JUST IN PROVIDING SOME METRICS RELATED TO HOW ONE MIGHT SIZE A FUND. THANK YOU NANCY. NOT THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR THE INVITATION TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS NATHAN POLLOCK ALSO FROM PHIL SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS WHICH I WILL REFER TO PATIENTLY AS FTP. AND I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE. TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE THIRD CONCEPT AS DESCRIBED BY MS MITCHELL THAT OF AN OPTION OF A WILDFIRE FUND. IS MISS MITCHELL MENTIONED ONE OF THE KEY OPEN QUESTIONS -- IN THE REPORT RELATES TO FUND SIZING. TWO KEY DRIVERS OF FUN SIZING OR THE FUTURE RISK PROFILE OF WILDFIRE DAMAGE AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL TAKE FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS TO TAKE EFFECT. THE STRIKE FORCE HAS BEGUN ANALYZING THIS QUESTION OF A WILDFIRE FUNDS CLAIMS PAY CAPACITY -- OVER TIME AND UNDER CERTAIN SCENARIOS. THE FOCUS OF THIS PARTICULAR ANALYSIS [inaudible] IS. NOT ON SPECIFIC FUND STRUCTURES BUT RATHER ON THE EXPECTED DURABILITY OF A FIRE AND AND ITS CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY -- RELATIVE TO CAPITALIZATION. IN ESSENCE THIS ANALYSIS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED LIKELIHOOD THAT A FUND WILL RETAIN CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE FUTURE. BEFORE SHARING THE RESULTS OF THIS INITIAL DURABILITY ANALYSIS HOWEVER. ALL ADDRESS THE AFOREMENTIONED DRIVERS BEGINNING WITH THE LEVEL OF POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY COST WILDFIRE. THIS REALLY TURNS ON HOW YOU VIEW THE STATE'S RISK OF FUTURE FIRE DAMAGE. THE V. P. HAS MODELED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SLIDE TITLED MODELED WILD FIRE FIND DAMAGE SCENARIOS -- WHICH SHOWS TO THESE RISKS SCENARIOS THAT'S ALSO ON THE SCREEN BEHIND ME. ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM IF THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE OUT LIARS. A LONGER TERM HISTORICAL ASSESSMENT OF WILD FIRE DAMAGE INDICATES MANY YEARS OF MINIMAL DAMAGE WITH A FEW LARGE EVENTS. BASED ON THIS VIEW CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED NO FUND OR PERHAPS A SMALL FUND TO COVER THE OCCASIONAL LARGE FIRE HOWEVER. AS YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY CROWFOOT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. AS A RESULT HISTORICAL FIRE DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS MAY UNDERSTATE THAT RISK. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM. IF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE LOOKS LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN EVERY YEAR. A WILDFIRE FUND ALONE IS ALSO LIKELY NOT A WORKABLE SOLUTION. WHERE AND HOW POLICYMAKERS ULTIMATELY VIEW CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE FIRE RISK ON THAT SPECTRUM? WILL IMPART DRIVE HOW LARGE A FINE NEEDS TO BE. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING FUTURE WILDFIRE RISK THE STRIKE FORCED HIS ASKED IF HE P. TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO PROVIDE YOU ONE DATA POINT ALONG THE SPECTRUM. ONE THAT ASSUMES THE NEXT TEN YEARS LOOK MORE LIKE THE LAST. FIVE AND TO ANALYZE THE RESILIENCY OF FIND THE SIZING SCENARIOS UNDER THIS PARADIGM. THIS IS AGAIN ONE DATA POINT AND WE DOES CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MODEL AND ANALYZE OTHER SCENARIOS. A SECOND DRIVER OF FUN SIZE IS HOW LONG -- POLICY MAKERS BELIEVE THE FINE NEEDS TO LAST. BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH WILD FIRE AND SAFETY EXPERTS THE STRIKE FOR STATUS FTP TO MODEL THE DURABILITY OF A FUND OVER AN EIGHT TO TWELVE YEAR PERIOD. WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THESE EXPERTS HAVE INDICATED MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE -- MATERIAL MITIGATION A FAX. VARIOUS SOURCES INDICATE THAT THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF AVERAGE AGGREGATE ECONOMIC DAMAGES -- RELATED TO WILDFIRES RANGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. BASED ON THAT. FEP DEVELOPED A DAMAGE RISK CURVE THAT REFLECTS A RISK OF AVERAGE ANNUAL LOSS OF EIGHT A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. WITH A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT IS TO SAY HIGHER FREQUENCY. OF FIVE BILLION TO FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR LOSS YEARS. THAN A LONGER TERM -- HISTORICAL DATA MIGHT INDICATE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS THE STRIKE FORCE ALSO ASKED THAT THE P. TO INCORPORATE A BLENDED SETTLEMENT RATE OF 50%. ON DAMAGE CLAIMS ACROSS BOTH INSURED AND UNINSURED LOSSES. SO THIS TIME I LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SECOND SLIDE -- TITLE LAST FIVE YEARS RISKS BURIAL RESULTS. SIR TO RECONSIDER THE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS I JUST DESCRIBED F. E. P. ANALYZED THREE SPECIFIC FUND CITED SIZING SCENARIOS. TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY THAT A FIND WOULD STILL HAVE CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY BY. TWENTY THIRTY WE ANALYZE THE FIND OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS. A FUND OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND A FUN SIZED AT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. UNDER THE MODELS SET OF ASSUMPTIONS A TEN BILLION DOLLAR FUND HAS APPROXIMATELY A 98% PROBABILITY OF EXHAUSTING ITS CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY BY. TWENTY THIRTY ON THE SAME SET OF ASSUMPTIONS A TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FUND HAS APPROXIMATELY A 53% LIKELIHOOD OF EXHAUSTING ITS CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FIND HAS A 7% PROBABILITY OF EXHAUSTING CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY BY. TWENTY THIRTY AT THIS TIME IS MITCHELL AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS ON PART THREE OF THE REPORT. SENATE MCGUIRE THINK YOU WERE ON THE PHYLLIS. JOINT THE STRUGGLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CHAIR. HERE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR DUE DILIGENCE ON PUTTING THIS HEARING TO GET ALONG WITH YOUR STAFF TEAM AS WELL -- INEQUALITY THANK YOU TO THE PRESENTERS WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GO DOWN -- JUST IN THREE OF THE THREE CATEGORIES A TWO CATEGORIES IN ONE WE DID NOT TOUCH ON TODAY JUST TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON FIRST FOUR WANT TO TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU MISTER CRAWFORD -- FOR ALL OF HIS WORK THE GOVERNOR'S WORK. ON A FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ACROSS THE STATE -- IN FOR BEING TRUE TO HIS WORD FOR THOSE THAT COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. LADY HE MADE COMMITMENTS LAST YEAR AND HE'S FALL THROUGH WITH IN THIS YEAR -- IN VERY GRATEFUL FOR THEM PLEASE PASS ON OUR SINCERE THANKS -- ITEMS THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND I THINK WHERE THE STATE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE PARTNERS IN REGARDS. TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND INCREASING IN ABOUT A TWO BILLION DOLLAR CUT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CAN I SAY IS FOR SERVICE BUDGET. HUNDRED MILLION I WAS PUT IN OVER THE LAST. SIXTEEN MONTHS -- FROM STATE FUNDS 40% OF HAS BEEN SPENT ON FEDERAL LAND. I THINK THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN WORKING. TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS -- IN JUST I THINK IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HYPERBOLE -- IN THE MARKETPLACE AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW THAT STATE IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOUTO TOUCH ON THE THE ENGINE SITS IN THE BUDGET. FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR MOVING ON THEM. AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE IS STILL THIRTY ONE CALIFORNIANS IN SHORT OF OUR PEAK. NUMBER ON THE ROAD WHICH IS BACK IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SO -- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS OF ONE NEED A HIGHER UP TO BE TO GET THE ENGINE CREWS TO TO BE A GOOD ENGINES -- THROUGH THE MANUFACTURER BY. WANTING TO BE A TO SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE OVER THE YEARS AND I THINK -- YOU POINTED OUT THE NUMBERS SEVERITY. OF THE DESTRUCTION THE SIZE AND SCOPE -- WE NEED TO BE A TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN THE SEVENTIES WHERE THE BURN RATE WAS NOT EVEN. A BLIP TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY. ANY COMMENTS ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE THIRTEEN IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. WELL I TAKE YOUR POINT FIRST OF ALL IN A BRING THAT BACK TO THE GOVERNOR -- AND OUR TEAM I IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- I WILL NOTE THAT UNDER THE CAL FIRE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WAS ISSUED THIS YEAR EITHER UNDERTAKING A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF JUST WHAT THE NEEDS ARE TO REALLY RIGHT SIZE BOTH THE PERSONAL AND EQUIPMENT -- AND SO WE HOPE THAT WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION THAT WILL GIVE US. A BETTER SENSE OF REALLY WHERE WE CAN AUGMENT AND HOW WE CAN AUGMENT -- BUT OVERALL YOUR I TAKE YOUR POINT AND AN AGREE WITH THE FACTUAL BASIS WHICH IS WE HAVE LESS FIRE ENGINES THAN WE DID -- YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS AGO AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE. IN IN AGAIN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL FIRE AT THE GOOD BUT JUST HAVE CHAIRS -- COMMITTEE. THERE ARE FACTORS THAT GO INTO ORDERING RIGHT WE HAVE TO BE IT TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME ABOUT A YEAR PER ENGINE FROM. WATER GOES INTO ACTUALLY COMING OUT AND WE ALSO HAVE TO STEP BY STEP UP TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING IN AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH -- WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE FOCUS ON RESPONSE AND HAVING. FEWER ENGINES ON THE ROAD TODAY THAN WE DID NINETEEN SEVEN FIVE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. YEAH I'LL JUST ADD THAT AN IMAGE AND SURE YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN OUT THERE FIGHTING THE FIRES NEED YOU KNOW ADEQUATE SUPPORT AND THEY NEED THE PERSONAL OUT THERE. YAH -- TO BOTH FIGHT THE FIRE AND FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND SO WE'RE TAKING THIS ANALYSIS BY CAL FIRE AS IT RELATES TO RIGHT SIZING THE FORCE VERY -- VERY SERIOUSLY FOR THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT -- IN GREATLY APPRECIATE IN REGARDS TO FINDING -- LEGISLATURE DANCE FUNNY LASHER TWENTY FIVE KNOWN FROM GOVERNOR BROWN TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IN REGARD TO PRE POSITIONING -- IN WE'RE WE'RE JUST STARTING TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE SWING OF PRE POSITIONING. ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WOULD IF IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE PRE POSITIONING DOLLARS. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED OF WEAKNESSES IS HAVING TRANSPONDERS ON LOCAL FIRE ENGINE SO AT ANY ONE TIME WE KNOW WE'RE LOCAL FIRE ENGINES ARE AT WHEN THEY'RE DOING. ADVANCING WITH MUTUAL AID. SO THE STATE IS FINDING TRANSPONDERS ARE LOCATORS FOR CALIFORNIANS THE OR NOT FUNDING FOR LOCAL. 85% OF OUR MUTUAL AID IS COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TO ENSURE THAT THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. IS IN COORDINATION WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE SAME TYPE OF LOCATORS UP FOR LOCAL FIRE AS WE DO WITH CAL FIRE SO THAT EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME SYSTEM. I SAY THAT -- I THINK HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR NOT GOING TO USE THOSE -- IF WE DON'T USE UP ALL OF OUR PRE POSITIONING DOLLARS THOSE DOLLARS COULD ALSO BE USED FOR THE TRANSPONDERS AND THE GPS FOR LOCAL FIRE FOR THAT SEASON -- AN ITEM I KNOW YOU LOOKING AT GOING FOR BUT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. I'LL TAKE THAT BACK TO CHIEF PORTER A CAL FIRE AND GET BACK TO YOU OFF LINE ON THAT. THE OTHER CHALLENGE WEAKNESS I THINK THAT WE CURRENT CURRENTLY HAVE A ONE A ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR JACKSON'S SENATOR DODD TO OUR TABLE -- AND ON ALL ISSUES OF EMERGENCY ALERTS -- AND AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH WHEN WE HAVE A NINE ONE ONE OUT EACH IN THE STATE. THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION -- AND THE LOCAL GUY. DOES NOT KNOW WHEN NINE ONE ONE GOES OUT WHEN IT'S CAN COME BACK IN WHEN TELECOM IS IF TELECOM IS WORKING. GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES IT TOOK SIX HOURS. SIX HOURS DURING THE CAMPFIRE FOR THE FCC. TO CONTACTED PC. HI THAT THERE IS AN OUTAGE -- IN THE TO THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES NEVER KNEW. TOOK FIVE HOURS IN THE TUBS. SO WHEN WE TAKE AND TAKE A LOOK AT FIRE RESPONSE THERE NEEDS TO BE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LACK. OF COMMUNICATION IN FACT IT'S A DARK HOLE IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN'T SEND OUT EMERGENCY ALERTS. AND OR NINE ONE ONE GOES DOWN. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO INFORMATION BEING SHARED BETWEEN. BY TELECOM DIRECTLY IN THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE'RE WHERE WE NEED TO BE OUT OF FOCUS AND IS PUTTING LIVES AT RISK -- IN NO THEY NEED TO EVALUATE THAT BUT JUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME REAL GAPS SAID. IN LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN ADDRESS. ANY -- SECURED A TO TALK ABOUT THE CPUC BUT AN OLD A SECTOR CROWFOOT BUT THE YOU MAKE BOTH POINTS ARE WELL MADE AND NOW I'LL TAKE THAT BACK TO CAL FIRE -- IN THE TEAM IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND GET BACK TO YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A TRAIN IN AGAIN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR HELP RESPONSE HAVE YOU BEEN. ON ISSUE SI PC -- AND LOOK -- IN. GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORK WITH THE CPC BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU IT'S ONE OF THE MORE CHALLENGING AGENCIES. AS A MEMBER PUBLIC TO BETTER PARTICIPATED. WHERE I WOULD BE CONCERNED IS IF THIS LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR'S LOOKING IN -- IN PROVIDING THEM WITH MORE RESOURCES. WHEN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN HOUSE BE SIMULTANEOUSLY WE FIGURE OUT? HOW TO BE ABLE TO READ THAT AGENCY THE INTERVENOR STATUS -- IN A QUASI JUDICIAL PROCESS -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF REGULATORY REGULATING UTILITIES AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT INVOLVING THE PUBLIC? THE KWAZII JUDICIAL PROCESS. CAN'T B PART OF THE EQUATION -- I'M UNFORTUNATE VERY FAMILIAR -- WITH THE INTERVENOR STATUS IN IF I'M A NORMAL JOE. COMING FROM COFFEE PARK. AND MY HOUSES BURNED DOWN AND I WANT TO BE A PARTICIPATE ON WHATEVER THIS RESTRUCTURING MAY BE FOR UTILITY I HAVE TO ACTUALLY I IF WE ARE TO KEEP THEIR CA AS A JUDICIAL PROCESS. I'D HAVE TO FILE TO BECOME AN INTERVENOR AND THEN IT'LL HAVE THAT STANDING TO BUILD INTERVENE IN A PUBLIC PROCEEDING. AND THAT IS HOGWASH SO -- WHAT I WOULD? EXPECT IS THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THERE HAS TO BE TWO PARALLEL SIMULTANEOUS EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THAT -- INTERVENOR STATUS ON THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T KNOW MISS MITCHELL IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO JUMP IN ON THAT. SO WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE INTERVENOR STATUS YOU% PROBABLY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THAN I DO I I WILL SAY THAT AS PART OF THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT. AND I AND I DO THINK THAT THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE I THINK THAT THAT PROCESS BECAUSE I DIGITAL PROCESS IS NOT WELL SUITED. TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND AS PART OF A PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTION IN DISTRICT FOUR IS CLEARLY INDICATED THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS NEED TO CONSIDER IN IN THE TOTALITY OF WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS WELFARE LIABILITY. ALL I'M SAYING IS WE WE CAN'T INVEST. AND THEN MAKE THE DECISION IT HAS TO BE DONE AT THE SAME TIME. I AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE FRIENDLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE COMING FROM THE PUBLIC TO BETTER PARTICIPATE AND I WON'T I KICKED A DAY DE DOG UNDERNEATH THIS DICE SO I BUT A MESSAGE KNOW THAT POINT WELL TAKEN AND I WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE STRIKE. FORCE IN LASTING MISTER CHAIR IS JUST ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE -- AND WHETHER IT'S SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT SENATOR JACKSON'S DISTRICT -- SENATOR CERN'S DISTRICT WE'RE SEEN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF HOMEOWNERS RECEIVING NON RENEWAL NOTICES. EITHER THEY'RE IN THE WOOLLY. THEY HAVE BEEN IN A COUNTY THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE. AND I THINK THAT WE ARE TEEN OURSELVES UP RIGHT NOW FOR CRISIS REGARDS TO THE LACK OF INSURANCE AND GIVE YOU ONE LAST ANGEL EXAMPLE. IF YOU'RE IN THE HILLS ABOVE YOU CAUGHT. I THAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RANGE WHERE WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT FIRES IN LEE COUNTY. YOUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE WAS HI IT WAS STILL ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND A YEAR. OVER THE LAST YEAR FOLKS ARE GETTING NON RENEWAL NOTICES THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO INSURANCE OF LAST RESORT FOR THE FAIR PLAN. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET IN OUT OF STATE WRITER THERE YOU HAVE GONE FROM ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS SUMMER NOW PAYING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SUMMER PAIN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THAT IS A GROWING CRISIS IN THE STATE -- AND IT'S IMPACTING COUNTIES ALSO THAT HAVE BEEN IN BEEN IMPACTED BY FIRES THAT ARE MAYBE IN THE MOVIE. SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE WE WE CAN'T ADVANCE THESE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT TODAY WITHOUT. ALSO HAVING THAT SAME -- CONVERSATION. CENTER THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT OBSERVATION IT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AND I DO THINK THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION HAS DONE SOME WORK ON THAT AS WELL SO. YOU MAY BE HEARING FROM THEM ON THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH HERE THANK YOU -- WE HAVE CENTER HERTZBERG UP NEXT AND CENTER JACKSON IN CENTER WOULD HOUSE [inaudible] POLLOCK. SECOND FRAME THAT SLIDES UP THERE NOW. FIRST IN FOR NEW INFORMATION WE'VE HAD A THAN A REPORT THAT WAS JUST RE READ TO US THOUGH WE'VE ALL ALREADY. A MONTH AGO. BUT WHAT I WANT TO SHARE ASK YOU IS WITH RESPECT TO THE GREEN LINE THE 7% RISK PROFILE. THAT YOU HAVE HERE IF USE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT NUMBER RIGHT AT A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND -- TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE. BUT TO THE RATING AGENCIES LOOK AT THAT RISK AND SEE THAT 7% SUFFICIENT. FOR PURPOSES OF THE GIVEN THE APPROPRIATE MAY THAT WE NEED FOR THIS FUND IF YOU ANY COMMUNICATIONS READY AND SHE'S WORKED INDEPENDENT OPINION THAT YOU MAY HAVE THAT THIS MODEL WORKS -- THIS GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAVE NOT HAD ANY DISCUSSION WITH THE RATING AGENCIES PERSONALLY ON THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION IF YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE DREAM JEEZ HARPER. INTO THIS BODY TO DETERMINE WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WORKS. BUT NOT AT THIS MOMENT SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THIS ANALYSIS IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND AND I WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT. YOU KNOW THE TWO FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS WERE TWO OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS. OF THE PROBABILITY OF OUTCOMES RELEASE AROUND WHAT. THE UP POLICYMAKERS AND AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODY U. S. THAT RISK PROFILE AT THESE DRIVERS I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE ESSENCE WHICH ARE RIGHT THE LAW. OKAY YOU PROVIDE AND PARTICIPATE IN REPORTED GAVE A SERIES OF OPTIONS TO THIS BODY TO THAT HELP US COME TO THE LAW. THIS PIECE OF DATA IS IMPORTANT IN MY JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT HOW IF WE DECIDE TO USUAL OPTION THREE WITH RESPECT. TO SECTION THREE OF THE REPORT HOW DO WE SIZE THAT YOU ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS IS THE ONLY DATA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME GUIDANCE ON IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU BY VIRTUE O YOUR EXPERIENCE. JUST ANYTHING YOU GIVE TO US BEYOND OU WROTE THIS I DON'T YOUR BACKGROUND IS. HAVE YOU PROVIDE THIS KIND OF STUFF BEFORE IS THIS HELPFUL CAN BE RELYING ON THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT GIVES GUIDANCE. THAT IF WE DECIDE TO MAKE A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FINE HOW WE DECIDE TO MAKE THE STACK. IS THAT GOING TO WORK IN YOUR JUDGMENT YOU'RE AN EXPERT WORKGROUP WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR SOME INFORMATION TO HELP US GIVE SOME GUIDANCE. ON HOW WE PROVIDE A SOLUTION NOT A BUNCH OPTIONS THANK YOU FOR THE OPTIONS BUT IT'S BE WE'RE UP AGAINST A TIME LINE. YOUR BOSS WHO HIRED YOU A SAYS THAT LET'S GET SOMETHING BIG DONE BY JULY TWELFTH OKAY I'M TRYING TO GET SOME GUIDANCE DOES THIS THIS IS THE NUMBER WE SHOULD USE. IN YOUR JUDGMENT. SO IN MY JUDGMENT YES TO OUR ASKING. FOR NAY AND I APPRECIATE THE THE WELL THOUGHT OUT QUESTIONS. THE 7% NUMBER REPRESENTS ONE RESULT UNDER A CERTAIN PROFILE AT RISK AND NOT HERE TESTIFYING. THAT THAT IS THE FUTURE PROFILE OF RISK IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE [inaudible] AND SO. WHAT YOU BELIEVE THAT RISK TO BE IS GOING TO CHANGE WHETHER 7% IS THE NUMBER SO? IF YOU'RE ASKING IS FORTY BILLION THE RIGHT NUMBER. I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO MEET BE CLEAR ON IS FORTY BILLION AS A UNDER ONE VERY SPECIFIC. RISK PROFILE ASSUMPTION I'M NOT HERE TO TESTIFY THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE -- TRYING TO GET SOME GUIDANCE AND GET THAT. WHAT IS THE ASSUMPTION TELL US WITH THE ASSUMPTION IS AND SECONDLY DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH DIRECT ASSUMPTION LOOK WE KNOW THAT WE WENT THROUGH A THREE YEAR EXERCISE WITH THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WE KNOW THE RATING AGENCIES THAT THEY SAID THAT WERE COMFORTABLE WITH ONE OF THE FOUR YEAR? TO VENTURE RICIN WE KNOW THAT THEY DEVELOP THE STACK THAT GAVE US ABILITY TO GET A RATING FOR THE FOR THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THAT 80% OF THE AGENCY'S PARTICIPATED IN. DEALING WITH THE ISSUE THAT MISTER GORE TALKS ABOUT THAT WE HAD A LEGISLATURE DECIDED BECAUSE THE EARTHQUAKE RISK WE DECIDED TO CREATE THIS AUTHORITY AND MANDATE THIS 480% DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE 20% DECIDED NOT. TO THEY PRICE IT THEIR WAY THE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE YOUR QUICK A TORY IT'S PRETTY GOOD GUIDANCE BY VIRTUE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE A HISTORY WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU SHOULDN'T BEFORE SHOULD EXPERT. YOU PRESENTED THIS CHART THAT YOU GAVE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT WE ARE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TRYING TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THEY HAVE OUTLINED TO THEIR LAWYERS AND EXPERTS A SERIES OF BROAD THINGS ARE JOB HERE TODAY IS NOT TO LET. YOU GUYS RE READ THE REPORT BUT TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME MOVEMENT FORWARD AND SOME GUIDANCE BY THIS DATE OF LET'S GET SOMETHING BIG DONE BY RECESS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE. HELP US GET THERE THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. FOR AND THEN. I'LL JUST CLOSE THE CANCER QUESTION I DO BELIEVE WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU GET THERE -- WHAT? WHAT'S REQUIRED THOUGH IS THIS IS THE FIRST ITERATION OF SOME OF THIS ANALYSIS. IT IS A STAKE IN THE GROUND WHAT I BELIEVE IS REQUIRED IS A DIALOGUE. WITH THIS BODY TO DO. MORE -- WORK AROUND UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU VIEW THE REQUIRED LONGEVITY OF THE FUND TO BE. TO HELP THE TERM THAT ANSWER I DON'T THINK. THAT I'M HERE -- PORN POSITION TODAY TO GIVE YOU AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER ON THAT OTHER THAN TO KNOWLEDGE THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE WE CAN DO THAT WORK IN A FAIRLY SHORT ORDER. BUT IT'S GONNA REQUIRE SMART COLLABORATION AND I CAN DIRECTLY SPEAK TO AT THIS MOMENT. BECAUSE IT GOT MORE FOR QUESTIONS SERVER NOT A MORE OKAY QUESTION NEXT QUESTION IS. IF WE DO NOTHING. IN YOUR JUDGMENT IF WE DO NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE GOVERNOR ONLY DOES WITH THE JOB I CAN DO WITH RESPECT TO EXECUTIVE ORDER WHAT HAPPENS? WHAT HAPPENS TO CALIFORNIA? WITH THERE'S ANOTHER WILDFIRE OR WE DO NOTHING WITH RESPECT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO NOTHING. SO CENTERS WORK IF I COULD TAKE THAT BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY PART OF THE STRIKE FORCE DELIBERATIONS A MISTER POLLOCK IS ACTUALLY BEEN BROUGHT IN TO DO SOME SUBSEQUENT MODELING. AM I I BELIEVE THAT THE STRIKE FORCES. REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT DOING NOTHING IS REALLY A GOOD OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE UTILITIES. DEAR ON THE BRINK OF OF BANKRUPTCY YOU HAVE RATING AGENCIES ARE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON CALIFORNIA AND YOU HAVE P. JEANNIE IN IN BANKRUPTCY -- AND YOU HAVE A RISK OF A POST PETITION FIRE. SO I THINK THAT THE STRIKE FORCE BELIEVES THAT ACTION IS IS IMPORTANT. IT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT DATA I I APPRECIATE YOUR FRUSTRATION I I KNOW YOU'RE A GUY WHO REALLY WANTS TO GET TO THE ANSWER AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I THINK IN THE CASE OF WHAT WHAT MISTER POLLOCK PRESENTED TODAY. IT IS A MODEL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ASK US TO BUILD THAT IS INHERENTLY ITERATIVE AND SO THE IDEA IS TO START THAT PARTICULAR DIALOGUE. I DON'T THINK THAT MR BOLICK OR I HAVE A VIEW ON EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS I DON'T THINK THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE TOLD US. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU IN THE GOVERNOR HAVE A VIEW ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WILD FIRE RISK IN CALIFORNIA YOU CAN FAIRLY EASY EASILYMODEL AN OUTCOME -- AND I THINK YOU CAN GET TO SOMETHING THAT THEN YOU YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO THE RATING AGENCIES AND THEY WERE VIEWED AS A POSITIVE MOVE FORWARD FOR FOR CALIFORNIA. FOLLOW LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE WAS. IF YOU MARRY THESE TWO IDEAS WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET. TO IF WE HVE TO THE JULY TWELFTH AND YOU LOOK AT THAT THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE APPROPRIATELY IS DEEPLY ENGAGED IN BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT A STANDALONE ISSUE. THERE'S HUGE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE FUNDING FOR THIS LEGISLATURE AND BEFORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU LOOK AT THIS EVENT HORIZON YOU LOOK AT THE TIMING OF THE THE THE BILL PUSHED LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO. YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN RELY ON HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A CLOCK. THAT IF WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS IS ONLY THIS BROAD GAS HOW DO WE GET THERE. ARE A IN THAT TIME FRAME. WHICH GOES UNDER THE IN THE RUBRIC OF IF WE DO NOTHING. I'M TRYING TO GET SOME GUIDANCE FOR PURPOSES OF HELPING I LEGISLATURE COME UP WITH SOME ANSWERS IN COORDINATION WITH GRAY PRITCHETT THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO ADVANCE THAT. PARTICULAR BALL I DO THINK THAT IN THIS CASE THIS IS ABOUT PRESENTING YOU A SET OF METRICS THAT YOU CAN USE. I'M I DO THINK THAT SUBSEQUENT DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE METRICS ARE. THE MODEL IS FAIRLY EASY TO OPERATE ONCE YOU START CHANGING THE METRICS AND IT IS REALLY SENSITIVE TO SOME OF THE METRICS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU COME TO A POLICY VIEW. ON THOSE ISSUES. I WOULD JUST CLOSE ON THAT PUT THAT POINT SAY SUFFICE IT TO SAY I THINK WE NEED MORE YEP QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON THAT. AND SO THAT WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND WE WHAT THE PARAMETERS ARE PUTTING AROUND THESE THINGS ARE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT -- YEAH PARAMETERS ARE IN THAT SO WE JUST GETTING A GRAPH AND SO. DON'T WANT TO SHOOT THE MESSENGER WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU WE NEED THAT. MORE ASSESSMENT THERE. I CENTER JACKSON IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THE SHIFT US BACK A MINUTE -- BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING NOTHING WE'RE DOING A LOT -- YOU MENTIONED THE FOR ITEMS STRENGTHENING THE FIREFIGHTERS ABILITIES AND SO FORTH. WHEN WE DID AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE PASSED LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO ADDRESS THE RESILIENCY IN COMMUNITIES -- A LOT OF WORK WE DID. TO BUILD AWARENESS TO HARDEN CREATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- PROVIDING EVACUATION ROUTES DOING MORE AND LOCAL PLANNING -- ASSESSING OUR VULNERABILITIES IN ADDRESSING THEM -- PROVIDING -- IMPROVING OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT HEALTH. A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING NOW -- AND IN MY POINT EARLIER WAS THAT WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR THESE THINGS WE'VE GOT THEM IN PLACE WE'VE AUTHORIZED CAL FIRE WE'VE AUTHORIZE FORCE MANAGEMENT. SERVICE WE GOT TO WORK ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO STEP UP IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST BE ABLE. TO TO TO TAKE A BROOM AND AND CLEAN UP THE FORCE AND 56% OF MORE FEDERAL ANYWAY I HAVE A LOT OF MY DISTRICT -- SO WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRES WE ACTUALLY PUSH THE FIRE INTO THE BACK COUNTRY WHICH IS FEDERAL LAND -- IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR OUR POPULATION IN OUR IN OUR PROPERTY SO -- AND AS WE LOOK GOING FORWARD AT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I I FIND MYSELF -- CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I KNOW THE UTILITY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THIS ISN'T THE SAFETY BRAIN THE FACT THAT -- IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF LAST YEAR -- P. JEANNIE SPENT OVER EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS LOBBYING THIS BUILDING. FOR A TO GET RID OF THEIR STRICT LIABILITY AN INVERSE CONDEMNATION THAT THEY OVER THE PAST DECADE HAVE GIVEN OUT MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO THE TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS -- I LOOK AT THAT IS MONEY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE TO TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE FIRES. AND SO -- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS MENTIONED IS THIS INVERSE CONDEMNATION I'M NOT SURE -- I'M NOT REAL CLEAR ON WHETHER THAT IS INCORPORATED INTO THOSE THREE ITEMS THE THREE OPTIONS YOU TALKED ABOUT. BUT FIRST OF ALL AS YOU KNOW -- INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT SO I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE CONTRAST -- CHANGE WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE -- BY LEGISLATION OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE CONSTITUTION -- IF WE WANT TO DO A A BALLOT INITIATIVE A P. JEANNIE WANTS TO DO A BALLOT INITIATIVE I WOULD SUSPECT THAT THE POPULATION IS NOT GOING TO BE JUMPING. AT THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE LIABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES. AND IN PART OF IT CENTER WITH WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT CAN YOU JUST LIMIT YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT HERE WE HAVEN'T REALLY. IS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED HERE TODAY IN VERSE IS NOT. WELLIN VERSE WAS ONE ON ITEMS WHAT'S THAT IN VERSE WAS THE SECOND OF THE THREE SIX CONCEPTS THAT WAS PRESENTED HERE AND I JUST WANT TO I HEARD THAT BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY INDIVIDUALLY IS COME UP WITH A PLAN ON HOW IN VERSE WOULD BE CHANGED. AT THIS TIME I JUST WHAT WE'VE GOT IS THE NEXT SPEAKERS ARE GOING TO BE -- YOU HAVE TO LEAVE HERE AT THREE FORTY FIVE SO WE GOT TO KIND OF MOVE. WELL THEN WHY DON'T I PUT IT FRIEDMAN IN THE TERM OF A CONTEXT THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT WAS REYES WAS IT IS ONE OF THE AND SO. BUT BOTTOM LINE IS I WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE WHOLE CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE AND WHY THAT IS BEING PROPOSED WHEN WE CAN'T GET THEM TO DO SAFETY -- WHERE THEY HAVE STRICT LIABILITY HOW DO YOU ARE HOW DOES ANYONE IS PROPOSED THAT? SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE WITH LESS LIABILITY THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS. I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS SENATOR JACKSON AND LET ME THANK YOU THE FOLLOWING TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS ON THE SAFETY INCENTIVES I THINK THAT THE REPORT IS A CLEAR THAT ANY SOLUTION. WHAT YOU OPTED AND THAT COULD BE OPTION TO IT COULD BE CONCEPT ONE IT COULD BE CONCEPT THREE THAT THAT FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CREATE INCENTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES TO ACT? IN A SAFE AND PRUDENT MANNER. REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO WITH A LIABILITIES STANDARD OR NOT A LIABILITY STANDARD THE REPORT DOES NOT RECOMMEND NOR DO I THINK ANY OF YOU WOULD FIND IT ACCEPTABLE. TO ALLOW UTILITY INVESTORS OFF THE HOOK FOR BAD ACTIONS I'M IN SO I I THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF ANY SOLUTION WITH REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE I THINK IT IS CLEAR FROM A FROM A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC THAT THERE ARE. POTENTIALLY WAY IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE ABLE TO INFORM THE APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WHAT OPTION TWO IS TALKING ABOUT IS AN EXPLORATION WITH REGARD. TO THE THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGING INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE STANDARD OF LIABILITY WHICH MAY NOT BE EIGHT EIGHT CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THERE AREN'T LEGAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I THINK THE REPORT CLEARLY CALLED OUT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO FURTHER EVALUATE THAT. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS PART OF OPTION TWO WERE TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATIVE THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISING ITS APPROPRIATE ACT -- AS THE LEGISLATIVE BOY TO INFORM THE THE APPLICATION OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION. SIR WITH HOUSEKEEPING. COMING BACK TO PART THREE THE PRINCIPLES -- I THINK YOU TALK ABOUT -- REQUIRING EQUITABLE A STAKEHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS AND FLY YOU TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND INSURANCE WE DON'T INCLUDE THE ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE WILDLIFE. URBAN INTERFACE -- BECAUSE THAT SET THE AND I WANT TO KNOW IS THAT. JUST AN OVERSIGHT OR IS IT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'RE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT POPULATION THAT HIS CHOOSING TO LIVE IN AN AREA THAT NOW BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE HE'S GOT A MUCH HIGHER RISK. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHERE WHERE THEY CAN MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS ALSO OTHER THAN THEIR INSURANCE COVERAGE. SO. I'M CENTER CASKEY WITH REGARD TO THAT ANYTHING THAT THE PURPOSE OR THE PRINCIPLE THAT WAS LAID OUT THERE IS TO MAKE THE POINT THAT. NO ONE CONSTITUENCY. CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE TOTAL COST OF THE WILDFIRE DAMAGE DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR ASSUMPTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OF WILDFIRE DAMAGING IN CALIFORNIA GOING FORWARD. IS SO. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN ADVISER WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT YOU HAVE THE THE POLICY MAKERS HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE. JOB I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER SPREAD THOSE COSTS. THE PURPOSE OF THAT PARTICULAR POINTIS ONLY THAT WHATEVER YOU THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE SHARING. OF AMONG THE CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS WHICH IS REALLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. HE IS A DECISION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IS A LEGISLATURE BUT THAT LEAVING THE COST OR PUTTING THE COST ON ONLY ONE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS. IS PROBABLY NOT A VIABLE LONG TERM SOLUTION I GUESS MY MY OBSERVATION WITH TO BE PART OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS DEALING CAP AND TRADE WAS -- TO REPEALS THE S. R. A FEE OF A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE LIVING IN THAT THE WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE WERE PAYING SO IT APPEARS THAT. THEY'RE NOT MAKING ANY CONTRIBUTION OTHER THAN YOU KNOW THAT BEING VICTIMS BEING VICTIMS ARE JUST SPOT THAT ISSUE BECAUSE THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING. HERE AND ON MY SIDE I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS ON THE AND USE DECISIONS THERE'S NO DISCUSSION OF PENALTIES FOR LOCALITIES AND I WAS WONDERING IF THAT WAS YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T USE THE BEST. IF WE DEVELOP BEST. PRACTICES IN PLANNING IN. SOME OF THESE LOCALITIES WE'VE HAD OTHER LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE TAKEN IT JUST SORT OF BLOW US OFF WHEN IT'S SUCH A GIVEN THE CLIMATE CHANGE GIVEN THAT. THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT FOLLOWING THESE BEST PRACTICES IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY IDEAS ON THAT. WELL POINT TAKEN ON I I THINK THERE -- THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING REGARDING. THOSE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE WILD MAN URBAN INTERFACE AND YOUR POINT YOUR POINT IS THAT. I THINK IS PERHAPS THAT THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED -- CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS EFFORT SO I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CONTRIBUTION THE DISCUSSION. AS IT RELATES TO LAND USE YOU KNOW WE'VE DEFINITELY CALLED OUT THE NEED. TO FOR FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN MORE CAREFULLY. HI AND TO BUILD FOR EXAMPLE THE THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENTS SHRINK THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T CALL -- FOR YOU KNOW PENALTIES -- AROUND -- COMPANIES FOR INCORPORATED TOWNS FOR THE WAY THAT THEIR WITH THEIR BUILDING. I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO WIN ANY AWARDS AND BEING COMPASSIONATE BUT I I UNDERSTAND I I NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR CAME IN WITH -- MONEY FOR BIãU COUNTY FOR THREE YEARS TO PAY THE LOSS THAT THEY HAD AD REAL ESTATE REAL PROPERTY TAXES BUT THERE WASN'T ANY CONDITION THEY HAD TO CHANGE ANY PRACTICES AND AND WE'VE HAD BEFORE SUB TO WE'VE HAD WATER DISTRICTS THAT DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING. CERTAINLY NEED THE MONEY SO I THINK I'VE GOT THOSE WE GOT THE POINT APPRECIATED BRING THAT UP THAT TO THINK THAT SOME ARE GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT -- CENTER STERN. CENTER RUBIO DID YOU WANT ONE QUESTION. WE JUST NEED TO WE NEED US YEAH WE ARE LET'S KEEP MOVING -- ONE QUICK QUESTION MISTER CHAIR AT OKAY AB WE'RE GONNA GET INTO. I WANT TO GET INTO THE COST OF INACTION REFINE THAT A BIT MORE IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT WHAT WE HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR MR SECRETARY THANKS FOR BEING HERE -- CHAPARRAL AND THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF THE SOUTH I KNOW THAT WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON BIG TREES I APPRECIATE THE CALIFORNIA FUEL MITIGATION PLAN WAYS BIG TREES VERY HEAVILY IN THEIR METHODOLOGY. LOOKS IT BIG CARBON. BUT I STILL THINK WE'RE LACKING A REAL PLAN FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NON TIMBER ORIENTED WILD FIRE RISK. JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR YOUR QUICK TAKE ON THAT I DON'T THINK PRESCRIBED BURNS I JUST SAY FOR THE RECORD I DO NOT THINK PRESCRIBED BURNS WORK WELL IN THE CHAPARRAL. YOU DESTROY THAT HABITAT AND IT'S GONE FOREVER AND YOU LOSE ANY OF BROWN OFF ANOTHER ISSUE SO WHEN YOU GET YOUR QUICK COMMENTS ON THAT SECOND THE COMMENTS ON HARDENING AND PASTRY ENCOURAGED TO SEE WHAT COMES FORWARD ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE A PEOPLE I DISLIKE QUESTION. I HEARD SO -- SO THOUGHTS ON THAT REGION I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT IS A REALLY TO CHAPARRAL I THINK THAT. TRADITIONAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE FORESTS AND CHABROL QUITE DIFFERENT. QUITE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF FIRE SAFETY IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF A COLLEGE E. -- SO I THINK -- A MORE INTENSE FOCUS ON CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS WARRANTED. I WILL KNOW THAT SOME OF THE EMERGENCY PROJECTS WERE DOING OUR WHICH CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN -- ENOUGH FOCUS. PERFECT THANK INCLUDES -- THIS PANEL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE TIME AND THE TALENT NAY INFORMATION THAT -- WILL WAS PRESENTED -- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A LOT TO MORE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH LET'S BRING THE NEXT PANEL UP PLEASE [inaudible] YOUR SPOT WELCOME I'LL LET YOU GUYS DETERMINE HOW YOU'RE GONNA START GOOD AFTERNOON.

TO IMPACT OF CHANGES IN LIABILITY ON THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL INSURANCE MARKETS AND RELATED RECOMMENDATIONS ON MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES TO COMMUNITIES. AND THEN THIRD SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON A FUND OR ANOTHER FINANCIAL MECHANISM TO ASSIST IN THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES STEMMING FROM WILDFIRES. WE'VE HAD FOR PUBLIC MEETINGS BETWEEN FEBRUARY FOURTH A SORRY BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND APRIL ACROSS THE STATE. EACH MEETING FOCUSED ON A SUBSET OF ONE OF THE TOPICS IN SCOPE AND IN THESE MEETINGS WE HAD SEVERAL PANEL PANELS OF EXPERTS PROVIDING TESTIMONY FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES AND BACKGROUNDS. I LIKE TO USE OPPORTUNITY THANK EVERYONE WHO HAS COME TO SPEAK TO US THAT ARE FOR PUBLIC MEETINGS. IN ADDITION TO EXPERTS WE'VE ALSO HAD MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM WILD FIRE VICTIMS -- INVESTOR AND PUBLIC OWN YOUTH ELECTRIC UTILITIES WATER UTILITIES RIGHT PAYER ADVOCATES INSURANCE COMPANIES -- INVESTORS. I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT EVERYONE HAS COME TO THE TABLE RECOGNIZING THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO A SOLUTION. AND I HAVE FOUND THE DISCUSSIONS AT PRODUCTIVE. I THINK AS A BODY WE WERE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED A MOVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF SHARE AND SHERRY MCCARRON. WHO IS THE? CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER FOR THE BUTTE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- IN HER TESTIMONY SHE WAS ABLE TO SHARE WITH US THE PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL TOLL. THAT THE WILD FIRES HAVE TAKEN ON HER COMMUNITY AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THROUGH THE LONG PROCESS OF RECOVERY. SO ARE FOUR MEANINGS WERE IN SACRAMENTO REDDING SANTA ROSA AND VENTURA. THE SACRAMENTO MEETING FOCUSED ON BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT SETTING WHAT WORK HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BEFORE IS STILL. THE SECOND MEETING IN REDDING FOCUSED ON THE TOPICS OF STRICT LIABILITY AND YOU TOTALLY INSURANCE. THE THIRD MEETING AND SANTA ROSA FOCUSED ON HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND UTILITY RISK FINANCING. AND IN OUR FOURTH MEETING AN VITARA FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT STAKEHOLDERS HAVE. A FOR A DRESSING THESE THREE ISSUE AREAS. WE WELCOME WRITTEN COMMENTS ANY POINT IN OUR PROCESS BUT WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED STAKEHOLDERS TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS -- BY APRIL TWENTY SECOND. WITH IDEAS RELATED TO THOSE THREE TOPICS OF LIABILITY INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL MECHANISMS. THIS DUE DATE FOR THE COMMENTS WERE STRUCTURE. TO BECOME AFTER THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT WAS RELEASED. AND SO WE DID HAVE FEEDBACK IN THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT PARTICULAR ANIMAL IMMENSE OF REPORT THAT WAS PROVIDED. WE RECEIVED THIRTY SEVEN SETS OF COMMENTS FROM A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RATE ADVOCATES AND EVEN -- EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS WHO JUST SENT US AN EMAIL WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IDEA OR SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO THEIR COMMUNITY WE ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN TESTIMONY WITH SPECIFIC FINANCIAL MODELS AND PROPOSALS AROUND FIND IDEAS. AS I MENTIONED WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS BODY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SO WE'RE AIMING TO A RELEASED TRAFFIC EMENDATIONS BY THE END OF MAY. AND TO DISCUSS THEM AS A BODY SOMETIME IN EARLY JUNE. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD I SENT TO THREE SUBCOMMITTEES. THE FIRST SUBCOMMITTEE UTILITY WILDFIRE LIABILITY AND COST RECOVERY STANDARDS INCLUDES COMMISSIONER KHN AND COMMISSIONER NAVA. THE SECOND COMMITTEE. ON WILDFIRE FUND AND ANY OTHER FINANCIAL MECHANISMS IS MYSELF AND COMMISSIONER WARRANT. AND IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE ON HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AFFORDABILITY AND COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE MITIGATION NEEDS -- INCLUDES COMMISSIONER JONES AND COMMISSIONER WAR. THE SUB COMMITTEES ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT STAFF IN PUTTING TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE ISSUED. WE WILL -- IN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS REFER TO THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED AS WELL AS ALL OF THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE INCLUDING WHAT'S COME BEFORE US TODAY IN YOUR HEARING. OUR REPORT IS NOT A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE STRIKE TEAMS REPORT. BUT IT WILL TOUCH UPON THE SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WERE REASON THAT REPORT AND I'LL SAY WHAT WE'VE BEEN WHAT WE SAW IN THAT REPORT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AN EXPERT IN PUBLIC TESTIMONY. ON OUR FORUM IN TERMS OF WHAT ARETHE ISSUES AND POSSIBLE OPTIONS -- AND SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY OPENING COMMENTS AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT OUR PROCESS WE REMAIN AVAILABLE TO YOU AFTER WE ASSURE I DRAFT REPORT TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS ARE RECOMMENDATIONS. MISSOURI ARE YOU DO YOU HAVE PREPARED REMARKS OR DO YOU WANT TO GO TO QUESTIONS WE SHOULD JUST GO TO QUESTIONS GIVEN TIME I WANT TO HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMITTEE. HERE START CENTER RUBIO. A SENATOR NIELSEN AND CENTER STERN I'M GONNA GIVE YOU -- TIME AND ENERGY HERTZBERG NEXT. YOUR HONOR. OKAY SORRY BOUT THAT CHIEF. OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW CENTER NIELSEN. I KIND OF GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS PANEL BUT IT REACHES YOURS AS WELL. I ARGUE THE CHARGE. IS TOO NARROW. YOU INDICATED THAT THIS WAS RELATED TO UTILITY COST FIRES. ARE PROBLEMS WITH FIRES AND DISASTERS AND THESE INCLUDE FLOODS THAT INCLUDES IS STILL WAY. THERE ARE BILL. IT'S THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS OF NEGLECT. BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. FOR THAT SPILLWAYS. IN THE FORCE IN THE WILD LANDS. OUR PROBLEMS ARE PRODUCTS OF DECADES. THE STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY. IT ISN'T FORCE MAJEURE. SO MUCH IS STATE AND FEDERAL POLICY. SO WHEN YOUR FINGER POINTING CERTAINLY UTILITIES DESERVE THE FINGER POINTED AT BUT SO DOES OUR GOVERNMENT. AND THE NEGLECT OF OUR OWN LEGISLATURE'S STATE AND FEDERAL FOUR SEN WHILE LANCE MANAGING. WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT. I SUBMIT. AS YOU GO FORWARD WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. OKAY SO HE'D. TO THOSE CAUSATIVE FACTORS PLEASE. THANKS SIR NIELSEN -- IT'S CENTER DR MAY I PLEASE. I WOULD SAY THAT I I THINK THAT THERE I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY THERE ARE MANY FACTORS CAUSING THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE IN THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO WILDFIRE. AND ONE THING WE'VE HEARD CONSISTENTLY FROM COME ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF TESTIMONY -- THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE VARIOUS HEARINGS IS THAT. AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE STRUGGLE WITH ON THE COMMISSION WERE CHARGED WITH ASSESSING HOW TO FINANCES SOCIALIZED COST. OF THIS PROBLEM. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MANAGE THE PROBLEM IS TO MAKE IT SMALLER. AND TO TAKE A VARIETY OF ACTIONS THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE NINE A ONE COMMITTEE AND ALL THE WORK THAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR AND IS HAPPENING THIS YEAR. ARE ACTING TO TAKE AS A STATE SOME. WELL I JUST LAST OBSERVE ONE OF THE FAILINGS. OF THE SO CALLED FIRE TAX THE THANK GOD SHE'S GONE NOW. THE MONIES WERE NOT USED FOR WHAT THEY WERE POMISED. YEAH WE USED BY THE PEOPLE I DID THIS TO YOU -- CENTER JACKSON AND AN OFFICE JUST LET'S JUST pFOCUS HERE -- CENTER STERN I CUT YOU OFF SO LITTLE ALL OF YOU GO NEXT [inaudible] GOOD POINT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MY CENTRAL CONCERN HERE IS THAT. LOOK THE SOLUTIONS MAY BE COMPLEX BUT I WORRY. WE'VE PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE A BIT AND I I DON'T THINK OTHER THAN THE MEMORANDA WE SAW. RELEASED LEADING UP TO THE STRIKE FORCES REPORT -- FROM PROFESSOR WEISSMAN. THERE HAVE BEEN ANY ANALYSES OF THE ACTUAL COST OF INACTION I KNOW THAT THE LAST PANEL TALKED ABOUT -- YOU KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN UNDERTAKING AND YES WE PASS SOME LAWS BUT I THINK. I I I STILL NEED TO HEAR THE SORT OF BEYOND THE P. JEANNIE TERRITORY RIGHT WHERE WE DO HAVE A LITTLE MORE GRANULARITY WHAT. WHAT AT WHAT WHAT DO RATE WHAT A RATE PAYERS FACING LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SCENARIOS MIGHT THEY FACE -- IF SAY WE JUST RELIED ON WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR BECAUSE I I APPRECIATE LAST HOUSES -- WE'RE WORRIED BUT UTILITIES GOING BANKRUPT WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS WHOSE HOUSES WERE JUST BURNED DOWN ARE CONCERNED WITH BUT THEY ARE CONCERT WITH ADDING INSULT TO INJURY AND HAVING. TO DEAL WITH RECOVERY AND DEAL WITH THE INSURANCE PROCESS AND THEN HAVE THEIR BILLS. UP SO DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING. MORE GRANULAR THAN JUST -- SOMETHING DIRECTIONAL TO SAY THERE'S A RISK. I MEAN IF YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LOOKED. MORE DEEPLY AT WHAT RATE PAYERS ARE ON THE STATE MAY FACE BOTH A MUNICIPAL TERRITORY AS WELL AS OTHER AYE YOU TERRITORIES. I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST IN OUR REPORT TO TOUCH UPON THAT ISSUE -- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH LIMITED TIME AND WE DON'T HAVE A TEAM OF CONSULTANTS BUT WE WILL GATHER THE DATA THAT WE CAN. AT TO INFORM THAT QUESTION. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS MISTER WHERE I KNOW THERE WAS OF THE ARE YOU I DO KNOW THE MEMO I'M REFERRING TO YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE THE I THINK HE SAID THE UC I'M FAMILIAR WITH IT YES SO DO YOU CONCUR WITH THAT THE RICH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THAT. WEISMANN MEMO. I THINK DIRECTIONALLY THE WEISSMAN MEMO IS. IS PROBABLY IN THE BRADY I A IS ACCURATE I THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS TO INTERVENE. BETWEEN THE CREATION OF THESE LIABILITIES DURING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND YOU KNOW WHAT RATE PAYERS AND UP PAYING AND WHEN THEY CAN BE HARD TO PIN DOWN THE EXACT DOLLAR VALUE BUT I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY. THAT SIGNIFICANT -- WE SAW AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL RECENTLY THAT -- THE ALL OF THE I. O. USED TO PUT IN FOR LARGE COST OF CAPITAL INCREASES THAT WAS PREDICTABLE -- AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF ALL OF THE I USE HAS BEEN DETERIORATING OVER TIME. AND I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER KIND OF SIGN OF FUTURE INCREASED REPAIR COSTS IF NOTHING HAPPENS. CAN YOU FOR THE FOR THE LAY PEOPLE TURNING IN. FOR OTHERS IN THE PUBLIC WATCHING WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDING WORKS Y. Y. E. WHAT IS THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT RATES AND WHAT WILL THAT DO SURE SO IN ESSENCE -- UTILITIES USE RATES TO PAY FOR THEIR EXPENSES THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES AND TO PAY FOR THE COST. TO THE THE INTEREST ON THE MONEY THAT THEY USED TO FINANCE AND BUILD ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE CALL THE INTEREST RATE ESSENTIALLY IS GOING UP. IN CALIFORNIA THE YOU KNOW WE YOU COULD THINK OF IT IN VERY YES SIR TO TO BE SPEAKING VERY METAPHORICAL TERMS HERE. YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE THAT WE COULD GET SORT OF A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE ON OUR TO FINANCE AND BUILD OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE'RE EVOLVING TOWARD A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO BUILD IT WITH HEY PUT ON A CREDIT CARD AND PAY CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATE. RATHER THAN A HOME MORTGAGE RATES. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE MARKETS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL INTEGRITY OF THE UTILITIES AND SO THEY DEMAND A HIGHER INTEREST RATE. TO LOAN TO THEM EITHER LOAN IN THE FORM OF OF DEBTS RIGHT BONDS OR EQUITY. AND SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM JUST LIMITED TO P. JEANNIE OR DO YOU THINK IT'S ACROSS UTILITIES AROUND THE STATE IN THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THEY CONSIDER THIS A CALIFORNIA WIDE PROBLEM. WE HEARD TESTIMONY ALSO IN THIS THIS JUST TO GO TO YOUR PUBLICLY ON UTILITY QUESTION WE HEARD -- MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF TESTIMONY FROM PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THAT INDICATED THAT THEY ARE HAVING. A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBLEM THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET. BY A GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR THEIR OPERATIONS -- IT BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WOULD GENERALLY COVER THEM ARE GETTING REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE OF THIS FIRE ISSUE AND SO. IN A IN A PRUDENTLY MANAGED UTILITY IS THIS STILL. IS THIS STILL A RISK FOR RATEPAYERS IN THOSE TERRITORIES. EVEN IF EVEN IF -- SEMPRA OR PIERRE OR EDICION OR D. W. P. OR SMUD. HAVE WENT FULL STEAM AHEAD WITH THEIR NINE OH ONE MITIGATION PLANS AND WE HAD A WHOLE HOME HARDENING SYSTEM DO YOU STILL ANTICIPATE INCREASED RATE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AND REPAIR COSTS AROUND THE STATE -- I THINK FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL THERE'S A TRACK RCORD. PERHAPS AND THIS IS ME SPEAKING MY PERSONAL CAPACITY I'M NOT ON THE AFTER THE COMMISSION I'M WONDERING IN YOUR INITIAL JUDGMENT I THINK IN MY INITIAL JUDGMENT YOU KNOW THE THE MARKETS ARE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT. THE KIND OF RISK REWARD PROFILE OF CALIFORNIA UTILITIES. AND PART OF THE PART OF THE JOB OF THE COMMISSION IS TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS FROM THOSE IMPACTS AS BEST WE CAN TO SAY YES. YES. WE DO ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES IF IF THINGS CONTINUE LIKE I THINK WHEN WHEN YOU ADD THE COSTOF THE WILDFIRES THAT HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED IF THOSE END UP BEING H. A TRIP YOU KNOW PAID FOR BY RATE PAYERS. TO THE COST OF THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS AS PROPOSED AND CURRENTLY BEING CAN YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTED BY THE UTILITIES. TO THE COST OF INCREASED COSTS OF EQUITY AND DEBT. THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE HIGHER COSTS FOR ELECTRICITY REPAIRS IN CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD. AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE STATUS QUO UNDER THE UNDER THE CURRENT SCENARIO SO WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION. THIS YEAR DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT. THIS ONE TO MAKE TWO OTHER POINTS AND ONE THAT REGARDLESS OF ACOSTA SOCIALLY WITH WILDFIRES THERE ARE PRESSURES ON RATES GENERALLY -- DUE TO NEED TO REPLACE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND SO THE STATUS QUO ALSO INCLUDES THOSE INVESTMENTS. AND THEN THE SECOND JUST TO MAKE THE GENERAL POINT ABOUT THE ROLE OF REPAIRS VERSES INVESTORS RATE PAYERS DO YOU PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS BUT THEY PAY OVER A VERY LONG TIME HORIZON. SO WHEN THE UTILITY IS APPROVED TO GO OUT AND INVEST IN WIRES AND POLES THEY HAVE TO GO UT AND RAISE THAT MONEY SOMEWHERE FIRST TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GO TO THE INVESTORS FOR AND SO IF THERE IS A BELIEF THAT THERE IS MORE RISK -- AND AT RISK OF NOT CAN BE MITIGATED IMMEDIATELY ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE OVER TIME THAT WILL LEAD TO A HIGHER COST OF OUR OWN. THANK YOU -- CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- JUST REAL QUICKLY WE KNOW THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WERE YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST COST THAT WE HAD IN TERMS OF FIRES. SO FAR I'M JUST WONDERING -- SINCE RETRAIN SO MANY PEOPLE I TALK ABOUT WE HEARD -- HERE ARE NOT GETTING RENEWED -- RIGHT WHAT TOOLS ARE AT THE INSURERS DISPOSAL TO AVOID CONCENTRATOR RISK OTHER THAN JUST COUNSELING POLICIES CAN GIVE US ANY INSIGHT. WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE -- IN COMMISSION TESTIMONY THAT. RATES ARE INCREASING -- WHAT'S CALLED THE WILDFIRE LOADING -- IN UTAH IN INSURANCE RATES IS INCREASING -- AND IT A NUMBER OF VERY LARGE NUMBER OF RATE INCREASE FILINGS HAVE HAPPENED HAVE OCCURRED -- AT THE ENTRANCE COMMISSION WHICH INDICATES THAT IN ADDITION TO NON RENEWAL -- INTEREST COVERAGE TRYING TO PRICE THE INCREASED RISK INTO POLICIES. WE ALSO HEARD FROM NEW JERSEY STREET I THINK IN THEIR VIEW AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE THEY CANNOT FULLY PRICED AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF INTEREST REGULATIONS STATE WE HEARD FROM -- INSURANCE -- REPAIR ADVOCATES THAT -- THAT THAT CLAIM IS IS CONTROVERSIAL -- TO SAY THE LEAST. AND SO BUT BUT THE THE THE MAIN WAY -- THE OTHERS ARE TWO OPTIONS TO STE OUR NON RENEWAL AS SENATOR MCGUIRE MENTIONED. OR PRICING. AND ARE BOTH A CHALLENGING FOR THE STATE AND FOR HOMEOWNERS AND WHAT FIRE AREAS OBVIOUSLY. NOT MUCH OF A SOLUTION MEHRI INTO SO STILL THEA. HOMEOWNERS AND THE VICTIMS ARE THE ONES VERY THE BRUNT OF IT. THANK YOU DID ANSWER MY QUESTION THINKS CENTER HILL THAN SENATOR WE CAL SKI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN EITHER. JUST FOLLOWING UP A LITTLE BIT ON ON SENATOR HERTZBERG'S COMMENTS FROM IN THE PRIOR PANEL YOU'RE YOU'RE CHARGED WITH A LOT OF ISSUES TO LOOK AT I MEAN THE THREE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. WHETHER IT'S THE LIABILITY COST RECOVERY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR INSURANCE IN THOSE ISSUES THERE. YOU ANTICIPATE WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE A SPECIFIC SINGULAR RECOMMENDATION ON EACH ONE OF THESE ISSUES OR KIND OF A A SELECTION. CHOICE IS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEIR SINGULAR RECOMMENDATION FOR I WOULD HOPE YOU. FRANKLY COME TO BECAUSE YOU WOULD THINK IT'S THE BEST IN LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT WE JUST SAW. EARLIER TRYING TO LOOK AT THE LAST FIVE YEARS RICH SCENARIO AND WE IF YOU COME UP WITH A RECOMMENDATION THAT AS THAT MOVES THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO THAN TWEAK IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SOME OF THE NEEDS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS SO WHAT IS THE AND THE TIME LINE AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN IN JULY BUT JUNE BUT WHAT WHAT IS A TIME LINE SPECIFICALLY. AND WHAT IS THAT -- ANSWER ON THAT -- THE ISSUE OF THE TYPE OF RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I MEAN OUR SOLE FOCUS AND PURPOSE IS TO HELP YOU GET TO A DECISION. AND SO -- MY ANTICIPATION IS THAT WE WILL MAKE AS MANY PREFERRED RECOMMENDATIONS AS POSSIBLE EVERY RECOMMENDATION HAS ITS PROS AND CONS SO I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL YOU WHY RECOMMENDING SOMETHING. AND THEN THE PROS AND CONS OF THAT OF THAT -- EACH ISSUE AREA THEY ALSO MAY HAVE A A CLEAR RECOMMENDATION THAN OTHERS AND SO WE WILL TRY TO BE. AS FORTHCOMING AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE'S DISAGREEMENT AMONGST THE COMMISSIONERS AND WHERE THERE'S CONSENSUS. I MEAN I THINK THE MAIN THING THAT OUR PROCESS HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING TO THIS DIALOGUE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AND DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. THEIR SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND IDEAS WE'VE HAD THAT FORUM GOING ON FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS A FORM THAT'S OCCURRED AFTER THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY AFTER THE CAMPFIRE AND SO THOSE TWO EVENTS I THINK HAVE -- FOCUSED THE ATTENTION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WE'RE GOING TO BRING THAT TESTIMONY INTO ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WE OFFER TO YOU. THANK YOU SIR -- CASKEY. WHEN WE CONTINUE ON THE FUNDS -- BECAUSE AS I SEE IT IF WE HAVE. THE PRESENTATION WAS FORTY BILLION WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE FUND WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. ONCE AGAIN IN THE SPIRIT OF SPREADING NAY THE THE THE RISK OUT TO DIFFERENT FOLKS AS I SEE THE BANKRUPTCY. ONCE WE ESTABLISH WHAT THE FUND IS THEN WE A PORT. PROPORTION WHAT WE THINK P. JEANNIE WOULD HAVE TO PAY WHICH INFORMS THE JUDGE IN THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION I'M WHAT. THEIR FEASIBILITY OF THEIR PLAN COSTS THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION. THE RISK I GUESS YOU EVERYBODY CONTINUES TO THINK IS WHAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER NO WE WE'RE WE'RE THE POLICY MAKERS WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WHAT THE HOW MUCH WE'RE IN. FOR AND HOW MUCH WE THINK IF P. JEANNIE HAS 40% IN THE SERVICE AREA THAN THAT THE UNKNOWN THAT'S THE REMAINDER I I WOULD THINK BUT HELP US OUT HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE CUT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE THE GREAT SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WAS. WAS -- CONCERNED WE'VE GOT WHERE THEIR TIME PRESSURES IS ARE YOU AND WE'RE TRYING TO KNOW IS FORTY BILLION IN THE BALLPARK AND WHAT ARE THE RISKS. IF WERE TOO LOW. START WITH AN ANSWER BUT A DOCTOR WAR HAS LOOKED AT THESE ISSUES EXTENSIVELY SAUSAL WILL TURN TO HIM. AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT WILD FIRE RISK MODELING IT'S MUCH LESS MATURE THAN OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS DEALT WITH ITS LESS MATURE THAN EARTHQUAKES AND HURRICANES. AND SO THERE ARE. LEGITIMATE MODELS THAT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT RESULTS AND ONE OF THINGS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TAKE TESTIMONY IS ON WHAT THEIR RANGE OF MODELS -- IS WHAT YOU HEARD A LOT OF MILES ARE STRUCTURED AROUND HOW BIG A FIRE CAN THE FIND A COMEDY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR AND SO THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT -- YOU NEED TO ADJUST -- I THINK WE WILL GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING -- THE OTHER TYPES OF LIABILITY AND RISK THAT YOU WOULD COVER WITH ANY ADDITIONAL SIZE FUND. BUT I DO THINK AS THE LAST PANEL MENTION IT ULTIMATELY WILL COME DOWN TO ALSO SOME POLICY CALLS BECAUSE A BIGGER FUN ALSO IS MORE COSTLY AND WILL RAISE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE AND THE STRIKE TEAM REPORT AS WELL AS IN YOU IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS. SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN. ADD FLESH TO THE BNES OF SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU. SAW ON THE STRAIGHT TEAM REPORT BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE SCIENCE ITSELF IS SO VARIABLE THAT IS TRUE THERE'S NOT ONE DEFINITIVE ANSWER. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE THAT THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION IS LOOKING FOR A PLAN THAT'S GOING TO GET NEW MONEY INVESTED INTO IT AND IF THEY HAD SOME CERTAINTY ON THAT. THAT BASED ON THE FUN BUT WHAT THE PUT THE PLATE WAS THEN THEY CAN WORK BACKWARDS WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN IT AND YOU KNOW IN PUT THAT NEW MONEY AND THAT'S MY CONCERN. I APPRECIATE THAT WHICH IS WHY WE WANT TO SUPPORT NUMBER WE CAN'T COME UP WITH. A PLAUSIBLE AND LIKELY NUMBERS FOR SUCH A FUND BUT I AGREE THAT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT INPUT IN THE BANKRUPTCY DISCUSSION CENTER HERTZBERG. YEAH I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR HELMS ARE ACCOUNTS HE'S QUESTIONS FIRST YOU SAID ON A COMMISSIONER PETERMAN THAT EARLY JUNE WHAT IS OUR REGION WE WERE DOWN WHERE WOULD THIS IS URGENT IN OUR JUDGMENT I THINK WE ALL SENSE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY IN. THE PRO TEM AND BLOWING HIS COMMITTEE WHAT IS EARLY JUNE IS THAT JUNE THIRD IS THAT JUNE FIFTEENTH. A SO IN TERMS OF THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS BEING RELEASED WE'RE TARGETING BY THE END OF MAY SO I THINK MAY THIRTY DAYS STILL MAYBE THIRTY ONE SO WHATEVER THAT LAST DAY IS WHAT WE'RE TARGETING -- AND THEN WE WILL PUBLICLY DISCUSS IT IN THE FIRST HALF OF JUNE SECOND. IS THAT GIVEN THE URGENCY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ISSUE GIVEN OUR CHALLENGES OUR SCHEDULE IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN SEVER OFF. PRIORITIZE AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD OF DELIVERING THE FULL BOOK AT ONE TIME JUST AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE SAID LOOK WE RICHARD SECTION ONE AND SECTION. THREE I THINK WE AS A LEGISLATURE AND ALL BUT BOTH HOUSES PRIORITIZE THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE URGENCY OF THIS. AND GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S A STATEMENT ABOUT THE THE TWELFTH AND ALL THE PROCESSES WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE I JUST SHARED WITH YOU IS IT POSSIBLY COULD SEVER OFF PIECES THE THOUGHT PROVES TO THE GIVING US THE WHOLE BOOK GIVE US A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS. THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT THROUGH EARLY ON TO YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS -- THAT ALLOWS US TO GET TO WORK EARLIER BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING HERE AND SAYING WELL WE WANT TO EAGLE NINE OH ONE OVER HERE MISTER NINE A ONE CREATED THIS AND THEN WE NO ONE ANTICIPATED THE SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW SO HOW DO WE TRUNCATE THAT. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THIS LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS WORK EARLIER OR RATHER JUST WAITING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S THE FIFTEEN TO WHATEVER IT IS THE BUDGET COMES OUT WE GET THE ASSEMBLY BILLS IN THIS HOUSE THEY HAVE OUR BILLS OUR ABILITY TO GET THIS DONE. IS DRAMATICALLY IMPAIRED ANY THOUGHTS EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER NOW IF YOU COULD AT LEAST TAKE THAT TO HEART. THE OTHER COUPLE OF POINTS YOU JUST QUICKLY WANT TO RAISE. IS AGAIN FOLLOWING UP ON CENTER HILLS COMMENTS WITH X. REALLY IMPORTANT IS A MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS RIGHT HE IT'S COOL TO TO BE ABLE TO SAY HERE'S THE POSITIVE NEGATIVES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. BE IF YOU CAN DRAFT THOSE REGULATIONS AND STATUTORY LANGUAGE YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT COULD WORK BETTER THAT AGAIN TIME TIME IS EVERYTHING IT TAKES US A WEEK TO TAKE YOUR DOCUMENT. AND THEN TRANSLATED INTO STATUTORY LINE WHICH GET LOWERS TO HELP YOU DO THAT. TO GIVE US BACK UP PLANS ON THE DATA SAID THAT YOU UTILIZING WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE WE HAD SOME BASIC DOCUMENT WE COULDN'T GET ANYTHING BECAUSE THE REASONS THAT WERE EXPRESSED. SO GIVE US DOCUMENTS THREE IF THERE'S A WAY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE LAST POINT. CAN YOU TALK TO THE RATING AGENCIES IN YOUR EXAMINATION DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL TALK TO YOU BUT CAN YOU MAKE AN EFFORT SO THAT AGAIN. PART OF ALL OF THIS IS INFORMED BY HOW THE FINANCIAL MARKETS SEE THIS IF W COME UP WITH THE PLAN BUT THEY DON'T ACCEPT. IT MAY BE GREAT FOR US WE ALL MAY CELEBRATED BY THE DOZEN ACHIEVE THE THE DELIVERABLE OR TRYING TO CHEAT IS TO STABILIZE THE MISSILE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. IN THIS EARLY THING AND THEN LATER OBVIOUSLY WE CAN DEAL WITH SOME OF THE OTHER REGULATORY PIECES BUT THE POINT THE CHAIR MADE. IN STRESSING WHAT HE DID IN THE OPENING WAS LET'S FOCUS ON LIABILITY IN THE MITIGATION PIECES BECAUSE A MITIGATION PIECE INFORMS THE WITH THE RISK PROFILE IS ULTIMATELY DOWN THE LINE. AND I THINK WHAT WAS TESTIFIED TO HERE'S IT'S GONNA TAKE IS EIGHT YEARS THAT MITIGATION PLAN TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT HAS A BROAD ENOUGH IMPACTS SO. HELPING US GET THERE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN FORMING THE PROCESS. RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THIS LINEAL APPROACH COULD BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK. CENTER HERTZBERG AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF TIMING AS YOU KNOW THIS COMMISSION HAS HAD RELATIVELY VERY LITTLE TIME TO CONVENE A DELIVER RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE ONLY BEEN. INFORMATION -- AN ACTIVE SINCE FEBRUARY -- REGARDING A TO MAKE ONE COMMENT ABOUT THE RATING AGENCIES WHICH UNDERSTANDABLY GIVEN THEIR ROLE I THINK THEY ARE. CAUTIOUS AND FRANKLY NOT WILLING TO SAY WHAT WILL CHANGE THEIR VIEW -- THEY SPEAK THROUGH THEIR PUBLISHED REPORTS AND THEY'RE PUBLISHED REPORTS HAVE EXPRESSED. THEIR SINCERE CONCERN FOR AT HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA TO LADIES IN TERMS OF PROVIDING YOU. INPUT IN MORE OF A PIECEMEAL FASHION ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS FROM THE INPUT WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR IS THAT THE THREE ISSUES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A FUNDAMENTALLY INTER RELATED -- YEAH THE SUCCESS OR LACK OF SUCCESS OF A FUND IS SOMEWHAT TIED TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT LIABILITY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE INSURANCE MARKET -- SO I WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE RELEASING. DIFFERENT PARTS ALSO GIVEN A AS A BODY -- WE WILL JUST IT'LL BE A STAFF REPORT AND THEN WE WILL MEET TO COMPETE. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO GATHER -- BUT WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WHAT WE CAN IN A TIMELY MANNER AS POSSIBLE. AND WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE YOUR VOLUNTEER SALARIES THE JURY FOR DOING ALL THIS HEAVY LIFTING BLESS YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT -- THE CITY CENTER MCGUIRE THAT SENATOR JACKSON CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TO CHEER ON MAKE THIS FOR THE QUICK -- TO BOTH USE THE LAST THING FIRE SURVIVORS. ONE HEARS THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO PAY INTO WHETHER IT'S A A RATE STABILITY ACCOUNT. OR VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND IF YOU WILL. SO BESIDES A A LUMP SUM PAYMENT FROM FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE. IS THERE A FORMULA THAT WOULD ALLOW ONE ON GOING. DEDICATED SOURCE FROM SHAREHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP ESTABLISH THAT. STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OR A COMPENSATION FUND IN YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. I THINK THAT YEAH COMMISSIONER AT WARREN ARE WORKING ON THE IDEA OF WHETHER FIND IS WORTH RECOMMENDING OR NOT AND WE SHARE THE STRIKE TEAM VIEW THAT THE MORE STAKEHOLDERS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO FIND THE BETTER. AND SO WE ARE EXPLORING WHAT OUR DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS OF THAT. I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY ANYTHING FOR THE EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT DOING THAT CONTRIBUTION BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US WHICH IS STRUCTURALLY HOW DO YOU MOVE FROM SAYING THAT. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SOME SKIN IN THE GAME TO PRACTICALLY ENSURING THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO STAND UP OF FUN THAT IT ENDS UP NOT BE EVERY CAPITALIZE THE WAY YOU ANTICIPATE INTO SOMETHING MORE OFFENSIVE THAN ASKING THOSE. WHO JUST LOST THEIR HOME TO BE ABLE TO PAY INTO FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROP UP UTILITIES THAT? POTENTIALLY COULD BE AT FAULT -- FOR THAT FIRE THAT DESTROYED THEIR HOME AS WELL. SO I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT AS FAR AS IN NOT AT ALL DOING THE DEEP DIVE INTO THE DETAILS. BUT IT'S ON THE TABLE OF LOOKING AT HOW SHAREHOLDERS CAN CONTRIBUTE I DO BETTER PROP UP WHATEVER TYPE OF FUNDS. YES EVERYTHING IS STILL ON THE TABLE THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. YES THANK YOU. OUR TWO TWO POINTS ONE ON THE INSURANCE ISSUE -- IF YOU COULD COME UP WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVEN'T REALLY. TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE DO CAP THEIR RATES BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'RE A PARTICULARLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRE ZONES. ARE ARE BASICALLY BEING -- A STRANGLED WHEN IT COMES NOT ONLY TO TRYING TO REBUILD OR REPAIR WHAT'S GOING ON BUT INCREASING THE COST OF INSURANCE FOR NON RENEWING. IT'S IT'S AN EPIDEMIC. THAT THEY APPARENTLY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH. PERHAPS OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO TRY -- TO EITHER INCENTIVIZE OR CREATE A CARROT AND STICK APPROACH I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT I DO KNOW THAT IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN MY COMMUNITY AND IS. A CENTER MCGUIRE INDICATED IN HIS AS WELL. THAT WOULD BE AN ASK -- THE SECOND ASK IS FOR ME IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO HEAR HOW WE ARE SO DEPENDENT ON THESE RATING AGENCIES MOST OF WHICH DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE LOOKS LIKE I MEAN THEY'RE ALL BASED IN NEW YORK -- THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SYMPATHETIC TO CALIFORNIA ARE THERE SOME OTHER AVENUE SOME OTHER FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT SO WE'RE NOT SO BEHOLDEN TO WALL STREET INTO THESE. ARE A COMPANIES WHO. REALLY I DON'T THINK UNDERSTAND CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND OUR CIRCUMSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF THIS HARDENING IN THE PLANNING AND THE THINNING IN THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO REDUCE THE THEY'RE NOT AS CATASTROPHIC CAM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL I THINK. A PLEDGING TO DO AN ALREADY WORKING ON IS OR SOME OTHER SOME OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR CARDS VERY CLOSE TO THEIR THEIR VESTING WON'T TELL US -- SO WE ARE REALLY AT THEIR MERCY IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN AVOID THAT -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA SET UP A ROOM FUND DO SOMETHING SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SO DEPENDENT UPON THE VAGARIES IN THE WHIMS OF WALL STREET AND AND THE FOLKS IN THE RATING COMPANIES INTERESTED SIR. I THINK VERY FRUSTRATING TO THE PEOPLE HERE TO THE TO KNOW THAT HAVING LOST A HOUSE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO REBUILD. AND THAT'S IT WHERE WE ARE NOW IT'S SUCH AS RECOVERY TO REBUILD IT'S TAKING FOREVER INSURANCE COMPANIES AREN'T COMING THROUGH -- WE WE WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF DELIVERY OF OUR BASIC NEEDS ELECTRICITY TETRA TO SOMETHING WE CAN DO INDEPENDENTLY IS A STATE. TO TRY. TO SHORE UP OUR RESOURCES WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY UPON THOSE FOLKS BACK EAST. AT ALL ALL FOR TWO POINTS WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE. HEARD FROM ACROSS THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND IT'S NOT JUST -- THE BANKS AND LENDERS BUT ALSO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT THE MORE WILDFIRE MEDICATION WE CAN CONDUCT. AND THAT IS SUCCESSFUL THAT WILL. MAKE IT EASIER ADD TO INVEST GREATER AMOUNTS IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEN JUST YOUR BROADER QUESTION IT I MEAN I THINK THE REALITY IS THE UTILITIES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. HAVE TO RELY RIGHT NOW IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO FUND THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE EXPECT TO KEEP OUR SYSTEM SAFE AND RELIABLE -- SO WE DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE'RE LOWERING RISK BUT MY SENSE IS THAT IT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT PERSONAL CALIFORNIA IT'S WHAT THE SS AS RISKY AND IF WE CAN DEMONSTRATE WERE LESS RISKY -- THEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US AT LOWER COST THANK YOU AND THAT'S A GREAT WAY. FOR ME TO IN MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO IS A LAST QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR AM AND THIS IS REALLY BASED ON THE LAST -- POWNAL SYFY MAGES. FOR UP FOR RECORD -- I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS BECAUSE I THINK I JUST HEARD -- THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN FERNANDO SEE EXPRESSES FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE A TIME LIMITATION HERE AND WE NEED. TO EXECUTE THIS N. DA HUNTER AT SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS OFFERED. IN EACH CONCEPT UNDER NEED THERE'S ALSO ALL THE RESEARCH THAT'S REQUIRED TO GET. TO WHAT A GOOD VIABLE OPTION SO SO FOR ME IT'S JUST CLARIFICATION PURPOSES SINCE THIS RESEARCH GONNA FALL ON OUR LAP OR THERE'S STILL GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO SEE IF. THE OPTIONS ARE ADEQUATE SO I DON'T KNOW THEY CAN ANSWER THAT OR WE CAN JUST PUT IT OUT THERE AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THE ANSWER TO THAT THANK YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR I APPRECIATE -- YOUR INDULGENCE WITH THE TIME IN THE LAST COMMITTEE -- PANEL SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ONE MINUTE -- BUT THE PUBLIC COMMENT EACH SPEAKER PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. YOU KNOW. BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU -- FOR YOU THE THE TIME AND ATTENTION AND YEAH JUST THE DILIGENCE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO THIS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR NOTHING -- IF I HAD TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN I WOULD HAVE A BUDGET -- FOR THIS IN SB NINE OH ONE BIT YOUR WORK AT AND HAVE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS JUST -- INVALUABLE WE WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND PLEASE THANK YOU CENTER AND IF I MAKE MAKE A PLUG FOR A WEBSITE -- PR DOT COM FORWARD SLASH WILDFIRE KNOWLEDGE BEING LISTENER HERTZBERG CENTER ON TIMING A BIG PART OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH THE COMMISSION. IS PUT ALL OF OUR INFORMATION UP ON THE WEB PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ALL THE TESTIMONY IS THERE ALL THE DISCUSSION. AND WE DO HOPE THAT STAKEHOLDERS WILL TAKE SOME OF THE IDEAS OUT THERE ARE READY AND BE DOING THAT RESEARCH CENTER AT RUBIO THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED -- SO THAT THEY CAN BRING THAT TO YOU AS WELL ONCE WE PUT OUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE DO EXPECT VERY STAKEHOLDERS TO START TO DO THE PENCIL SHARPENING AROUND THE IDEASWE PUT FORWARD TO REALLY HELP YOU COME FOR AT REACH A A REASONABLE A SOLUTION TO THESE CHALLENGES.

NONE OF THIS IS SUSTAINABLE UNLESS THAT HAPPENS FRANKLY. SECONDLY I WANT TO ADDRESS POINT MR STERN RAISE THE QUESTION HE RAISED ABOUT RATES IN CALIFORNIA THE TIPPING POINT. DOCUMENT THAT'S BEEN HANDED OUT CALIFORNIA'S RATES ALREADY 6290% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHAT WE'VE DONE TODAY IS PROJECTED OUT WE'RE P. GENIES RATES ARE HEADED. JUST WITH THE RATE INCREASES THAT ARE PENDING AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TODAY AND BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY'LL GO TO TWENTY SEVEN CENTS WHICH IS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF TIMES. THE NATIONALAVERAGE IS ABOUT AN EIGHT CENT INCREASE OVER WHERE THEY ARE TODAY THAT'S WITHOUT A SINGLE PENNY. OF LIABILITY COSTS BEING PUT INTO THOSE RATES SO IF ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL REPAIR CONTRIBUTIONS BEYOND WHAT WE'RE ALREADY GOING TO BE FACING. WE WOULD BE WELL ABOVE THIRTY CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR THIRTY FIVE CENTS A KILOWATT I CALL THAT'S UNSUSTAINABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

WE LOST EVERYTHING WE OWNED THE INSURANCE ON THE HOME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ENOUGH TO RECOVER TO COVER REBUILDING BUT IT WASN'T. WITHOUT A HOUSE WELLS FARGO CALLED IN THE LOAN AND LEFT US WITH THE DEED TO TEN BURNED ACRES. WE'VE BEEN OUT OF POCKET SINCE THEN WE LIVED ON OUR PRINTER PROPERTY AND A FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT TRAILER FOR THREE YEARS AND RECENTLY MOVED INTO A RENTAL HOME BECAUSE WE HAVE SIGNED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH P. JEANNIE IN NOVEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH THEY CHOSE NOT TO PAY BEFORE FILING BANKRUPTCY WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO PAY OTHER SURVIVORS THAT SIGNED AGREEMENTS AFTER US. NOW ANY RESTITUTION MAY COME IN A FEW YEARS IF AT ALL. WE'RE STILL IN SURVIVAL MODE SINCE THE FIRE. THE STORE IS TAKEN.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING OF THE CAPITAL TELLING YOUR STORY WE VERY MUCH I'M SORRY FOR WHAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH. MY NAME'S NEIL MCEWEN I HAVE A MASTER'S ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING FOR MEMBERS TO COLORADO. AND BEING FINANCE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT HUMAN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OR EXHILARATING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE THIS FACT DOES NOT ABSOLVE P. JEANNIE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE. THEY CHOSE NOT TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEIR LINES THROUGH A SIMPLISTIC COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. JUST AS THEY CHOSE NOT TO IMPLEMENT A PART EMERGENCY POWER DISCONNECT PROGRAM. A BEFORE PARADISE THE VP OF CUSTOMER ENERGY SOLUTIONS ERIN JAY JOHNSON ACKNOWLEDGE RED FLAG WARNINGS THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE CAMPFIRE DURING A PRESENTATION REGARDING THE EMERGENCY POWER DISCONNECT PROGRAM. IN THE CALAVERAS COUNTY SUPERVISORS CHAMBERS EVEN THOUGH THESE WARNINGS WERE PRE CONDITION FOR SHUTTING OFF THE POWER THEY CHOSE NOT TO IMPLEMENT IT. P. GINNY COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LOOK GET OFF THE HOOK WITH AN EXPENSIVE AD CAMPAIGN BLAMING GLOBAL WARMING AND HIDING IN BANKRUPTCY. SHAREHOLDERS MUST ALSO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR CALVET CORPORATE MALFEASANCE. TO ALLOW P.
