SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSALS RELATED TO EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO. A CD E. AND SOCIAL SERVICES SEVERAS. STARK IN THAT ORDER THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO AND IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO GET A START. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JENNIFER TOOK. A DEPUTY AT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES NOT JUST GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW SOME OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. SINCE THAT WERE IN YOUR AT. AND AS AS THE CHAIR JUST INDICATED THE CORPORATE NINETEEN. HAS HAD. IMPACTS ON THE CHILD CARE SECTOR AND I'M PARENTS AND CHILDREN WHO RELY ON CHILD CARE TO SUPPORT EARLY LEARNING AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. THE MAIN CHEN BUILT ON PRIOR INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS DISRUPTION. ON THE CHILDREN FAMILIES AND WORK WITH THIS INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN RELIEF FOR THE WORKS FOR. ACCESS AND INVEST TO STRENGTHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. FEDERAL FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING FOR THE RECOVERY AND SUPPORTING STABILITY OF FAMILIES AND THE WORK FORCE AND THE PROGRAM SERVING. THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO BUILD OCCUPATIONS FROM THE MASTER PLAN AND- AIR TO TRANSFORM THE STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE'RE FULLY COMMITTED AS WELL TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF. PROGRAMS FROM CD ET CDSS AFFECTED JULY FIRST AS WE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE DETAILS IN THE MAY REVISION THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS OF FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING THESE INCLUDE ONE TIME STIPENDS TO ALL LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME PROVIDERS AND IT ISN'T JUST TEARED STIPENDS FOR LEISTON CENTERS. FROM. THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ONE TIME PROVIDER STIPENDS OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CHILD WHO RECEIVES A SUBSIDY. WE ARE A FAMILY FEES FOR ALL FAMILIES THROUGH THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. A ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN THE CHILD CARE AND IS A PROJECT TO BUILD CAPACITY.

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS ALREADY MADE THROUGH CARE SPENDING AND THROUGH A PANDEMIC RELIEF PACKAGE ENACT. EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THEY REFLECT AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED THROUGH A WORKGROUP PROCESS MINISTRATION AND THE CHILD. CARE PROVIDERS UNITED YEAH. CRITICALLY THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES TO ADD MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS. SIXTY THREE THOUSAND OF THESE SLOTS ARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM CAPTURES. THAT CAN HELP TO PROVIDE PARENTAL CHOICE AND ENSURE THAT FAMILIES WITH VARIABLE IN NONTRADITIONAL WORK SCHEDULES CAN ONLY ACCESS CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. INVESTMENT IN FORTY TWO THOUSAND GENERAL CHILD CARE SLOTS WILL ALSO HELP TO INCREASE ACCESS AND ALLOW PERCENT FOCUS AS WELL AND SERVING INFANTS AND TOP. THERE ARE AN ADDITIONAL. ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWELVE. IN MY CURRENT ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM AND FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS FOR THE EMERGENCY BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR FOSTER. IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA REGARDING THE INTERACTION OF RATES AND SLAPS WE WANT TO EXPRESS THAT WE ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE UPTAKE OF THESE ADDITIONAL SLOTS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT WAIT LISTS AND A GREAT DEAL OF UNMET NEED AND HISTORICALLY ADDITIONAL ABOUT YOUR SPOTS HAVE BEEN QUICKLY REALIZED. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS BUT I'D LIKE TO FIGHT IN THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO INVEST IN LOCAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECT DEPOSIT PAYMENTS FOR PROVIDERS.

MORE FAIR COURTS WITH THE LETTER ANALYST'S OFFICE HAVE A FEW LEVEL COMING BASED ON UNDERSTANDING OF CHILD CARE GIVERS PACKET. WE WOULD NOT THAT ARE OF THE PACKAGING HAVE ALL AS BUDGET CONTINUE TO BE A BIT. SO FIRST COMMENT. IT'S ABOUT THE FUNDED SLOTS- OF THE SIX. SIXTY THOUSAND SLOTS OF THE HUNDRED FIVE FUND WITH WIDE PURPLE. WE ASKED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SLOTS THAT AREN'T WITH. WITH AND TWO TWENTY TWO TO THREE. SO BIG BECAUSE OF THIS WE DO RIGHT. ALL A- OUR WITH. ONE WE ESTIMATE THE ACTION WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION. WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS THE STATE COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS PLUS UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE RECOMMEND ABOUT GEORGE LOTS INSTEAD OF GENERAL CHILD CARE SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE FUNDS SOURCED THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT YOU'RE ABLE TO BEGIN. USING SLOTS- BUT SHE QUICKER THAN GENERAL CHILDCARE- DONALD TRUMP WRITERS. WITH THIS PLAN IS TO MAKE THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO FUND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND CHARACTERS LEFT FROM OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WORK- COACH. FIRST OF ALL IT'S DISABLING FAMILIES FROM CHILD CARE BOTH IN JUNE TWENTY TWO IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE- ONE TEMPORARY STOCKS ARE SET TO EXPIRE HE PUSHES THE DATE BACK OF THE SYSTEM MOMENT UNTIL JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. WORK ON THE STATE COULD CONTINUE BECAUSE LIKE BY DEFINING ONGOING FUNDING STORES. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE STATE WITH NEED TO IDENTIFY UNDER THE UNDER OF THE LA OVERCOME BIGELOW STREET ACROSS THE STATE WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION. OF ONGOING RESOURCE IN THE BUDGET BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH THE STATE WOULD NEED TO IDENTIFY TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION AND ONGOING RESTRICTIONS BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION UP ON FOREIGN. RESOURCES BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE- ARE. CRIMINAL THE FLOOR IS WITH REGARD TO MIX EXPERIENCE- OF THE FIX. FIVE GOING TO PROGRAM. NO I JUST THINK GAME DEFINITELY OF THE DOING BANKS. THE BILL PACKAGED. WHAT 6% THE STOCK. IS GOING VOUCH PRO. IN THE RING. FOR PER. THANK GOING TO TREND PRO. THE LEGISLATURE MIDDLE COULD DIFFERENT MAKES TO PAY ON ITS- FOR EXAMPLE IF THE ALREADY WHAT'S YOUR MEDIA. ACCESS TO CHILD- PUBLIC WITH ONE OF. MORE LAST UNDER THE TYPICAL TAKES NINE MONTHS TO UP GENERAL CHANNEL CARE SPOTS DUE TO THIS CONTRA. CROSS AND ONLY A FEW MONTHS WRAP UP THE DOCTORS. THE LATEST MABEL TO. GENERAL CHILD SLOTS IF WANTS TO A BETTER SPECIFIC IF GROUPS SUCH INTENSE. BOTH OUTRAGE I DON'T CARE PROGRAM I'M SORRY. THINGS BUT THE STATE HAS MORE ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE. BY AGE OF THEM BY AGE GROUP AND- TRY CARE BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTING. PROCESS THANK YOU YOUR CALL MAY IN THERE ABOUT THE- PACKAGE TO HOW THE STATE IS LEADING FOR HEALTH HOW GOVERNOR PROPOSED. TO EXPAND THE FEDERAL RELIEF. SO THE FIRST IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS FAILED INCLUDE FOR TO FULLY TO POINT THREE BILLION OF CARE. ARE FUNDS- WHAT THIS CHILD STABLE THE FUNDING FOR PARKS THE IS TO PROVIDE GRANTS CHILD CARE PROVIDER TO PAY FOR COSTA AS- RENT CLEANINGS THE- STABILIZATION- TRAVESTY WITH THE FUNDS TO WILL TO PUT THREE. THEY MUST BE FULLY BY. THIRTIETH TWO TWO THREE HOWEVER THE FEDERAL STRONGLY STATES TO EXPAND THESE. BUTTONS BY DECEMBER ELEVENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CONGRESSIONAL TO HEAR WAS THAT THESE RESTRICTIONS BE USED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE FISCAL RELIEF PITCHER THE CHILD CARE SECTOR. AND I THINK WITH PROVIDERS THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM THE STATE'S THE DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION WARNS THAT BRITAIN. SHOULD CHILD CARE. PROVIDERS BASED ON OPERATING EXPENSES. SACRAMENTO IS WITH REGARD TO THE CHOI AND FIFTY MILLION. AND PARKER. UNFUNDED PROPOSED IN FRESH GRANTS WE WOULD JUST YOU KNOW THAT ARE BUT SHALL CARE. CANNOT BE EITHER FOR WHICH- OF A THREE. PLAN IT IS IMPORTANT INCLUDE MINUTE MINOR INTERFACE. SUCH AS INSTALLING NEW AGE FACTORS DETECTED IS THAT A LOCAL USE OF THE R. PROVIDE. SO GIVEN THESE RESTRICTIONS IF THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSAL WILL NEED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED TO EXCLUDE. ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT. ORDER THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO BE FUNDED WITH. GENERAL FUND. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT. THE APPROPRIATE TIME OKAY THANK YOU. WE HEARD FROM THE SOCIAL. TO DEPARTMENT OF A- HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. WE DEAR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERENATA MARC AND DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO SEE SO MUCH IN THIS PROPOSED MAY REVISED RELATED TO EARLY EDUCATION WITH A HISTORIC AND UNPRECEDENTED PROPOSED INVESTMENT FOR T. K. EXPANSION IN THE EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM A COUPLE. WE'LL BE SAVING A REMARKS REGARDING THE T. K. PROPOSAL FOR THE NEXT PANEL. BUT WANTED TO BEGIN WITH SHARING WHAT WE KNOW FROM DECADES WORTH OF RESEARCH AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THESE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS LEVERAGE THE PROMISE OF EARLY EDUCATION. HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE IMPACTS ON THOSE SHORT TERM OUTCOMES LIKE TEST SCORES. AS WELL AS LONG TERM OUT KINDS INCLUDING GRADE RETENTION REDUCTION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION PLACEMENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND LATER INCOME AND BECOMING A HOMEOWNER. THESE HIGH QUALITY LEARNING EXPERIENCES IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS ARE POSSIBLE INTO SCHOOL BASED AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS. RECENT RESEARCH OUT OF BOSTON AND THAT THEIR LOCAL EDUCATION. BASED PRESCHOOL PROGRAM BOOSTING COLLEGE ATTENDANCE SAT TEST TAKING AND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES AND ALSO DECREASED JUVENILE IN PERSON INSPIRATION. HOWEVER HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL LEARNING EXPERIENCES REQUIRE INTENTIONAL INVESTMENTS IN A WELL QUALIFIED EDUCATORS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTS THOUGHTFUL CURRICULUM MEANINGFUL FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR MULTI LINGUAL AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. DESPITE THAT MAYBE PRICES MAJOR INVESTMENT IN TEEKAY WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG PART OF CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL SYSTEM. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS THEY DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AT CSGP IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS. A BIG PART OF STABILIZING THE FUTURE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THIS THE FTP PROGRAM WILL BE ADDRESSING COMPENSATION. RATES AND THE COST OF PROVIDING QUALITY CARE. SAID THERE'S A LITTLE BACK STATEMENTS WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE ME REVISED INCLUDE FUNDING FOR ONE TIME STATEMENT. WHICH WILL HELP WITH THE ONE TIME HIGHER COSTS DUE TO COOK AT NINETEEN. THE SUPER COLA. WELL WE APPRECIATE RECEIVING A CALL OF OUR PROGRAMS YOU ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PRESCHOOL. PROGRAMS DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL ALLOW ASK YEAR IN LIGHT OF THE GAP PROPOSED. HE TOLD AS WELL AS HOW MUCH OF HER ARE STRUGGLING WE WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO ALLOCATE THE SAME COLLECTED THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR C. S. B. T. ADVOCATE TWELFTH. RCS PP RATES ONE CRITICAL PIECE THAT WE WILL NEED TO ADDRESS AT THE STATE. IS ABLE TO KEEP CURRENCIES P. FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE MASTER PLAN. IS ADDRESSING THE C. S. P. P. RATE WHICH IS FAR BEHIND THE T. K. RATE AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE. ARMAR A REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR VOUCHER BASED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED COLETTE THAT MAYBE IF I SEE S. P. P. S. OUR RATE IS ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND LESS PER CHILD THAN THE AVERAGE RMR FOR THE SAME EACH CHILD. IN A CENTER SETTING THAT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE HE THE LEVEL OF QUALITY STANDARDS. IT IS ALSO LESS THAN THE AVERAGE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME RIGHT WHERE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR ANY EDUCATION OR ANYTHING BEYOND BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE T. K. PROGRAMS ALSO RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PER CHILD PER DAY AND THE CSP KEEP PROGRAMS. ABOUT 76% MORE FRIENDS PER CHILD PER DAY THEN THE PART DAY. AND 9% MORE AND A FULL DAY. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE TWO OTHER AREAS WHERE INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED PER CDC S. P. P. PROGRAMS. DIRECT DEPOSIT. THEY MADE A REVISION PROVIDES THE CDS THAT'S WITH SIX MILLION TO SUPPORT DIRECTOR PROCESS. FOR THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS UNDER THEIR PURVIEW. AS THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS YES PP THIS CD WOULD LIKE TO SEE SIMILAR RESOURCES APPROPRIATED TO ALLOW DIRECT DEPOSIT FOR CSGP CONTRACTORS. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR THIS TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. SAID THAT A STATEWIDE SOLUTION THAT WOULD APPLY TO BOTH DEPARTMENTS AND ALL PROGRAMS AND EARLY LEARNING CARE CAN BE DEVELOPED WHILE MAINTAINING THAT. TRANSPARENCY OF STATE ACCOUNTING DATA THROUGH THE FISCAL ASSISTANT INSTEAD OF MOVING OUTSIDE OF IT. AND THEN TAKE. THE CD WILL HAVE DATA NEEDS FOR C. S. B. P. AND RIGHT OF CONNECTIONS TO CRADLE TO CAREER. ON THE MASTER PLAN GOALS AROUND P. THREE ALIGNMENT. OVER THE NEXT YEAR WE WILL BE DIVING INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS AT THE CHILD PROVIDER AND FAMILY LEVEL. TO ENSURE THAT STATE PRESCHOOL DATA CAN CONNECT WITH THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THE NEXT STEPS FOR CD IN THE SPACE IS TO BRING ON PROJECT MANAGEMENT. TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE STATE'S PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE HOW PROCESS. WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THANK. YOU SO MUCH THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. OKAY THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE ROLE ROQUE. WE COULD. MCCARTY HERE GALLAGHER PLEASE BEAR MEDINA. O'DONNELL BRASS. BY A DARK YEAH. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM AT AGAIN WE WILL BE TAKING VOTES TODAY AB DISS INFORMATIONAL FOR TODAY SO WE CAN NOW BEGIN WITH A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS RELATED TO THE ISSUE NUMBER ONE THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY EDUCATION PACKAGE- NOT RELATED TO K. THAT'S ISSUE NUMBER TWO KATO EXISTENCE IS THE C. D. AND E. S. S. PROGRAMS ALL I'LL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT I CAN. START WITH OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANYBODY SOMEONE MEMBER VITAS. THANK YOU- SO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WHAT. THIS IS BEEN A DEVASTATING YEAR- FOR CHILD CARE FOR FAMILIES- I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WE'VE LOST OLD NEARLY- THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND REBUILDING- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- ARE YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR DEPARTMENT IS PREPARED DO YOU NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- ARE THERE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- FOR YOU TO START TO. ADD YOU HAVE ENOUGH ANALYSTS IN YOUR COMMUNITY CHILD CARE LICENSING- TO START TOO APPROVAL LICENCES RAPIDLY- I DO FEEL SUPPORTED. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER OUR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION DOES INDEED STAND READY TO CONTINUE TO. ENSURE THAT LICENSING IS THAT IS THE SMOOTH AND EFFICIENT PROCESS WE ALSO DO HAVE SOME INVESTMENTS IN- BUT I MENTIONED IN THE OVERVIEW WITH RESPECT TO BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES. BUT ALSO WITH RESPECT TO CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE FIELD AND WE FEEL THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS EXACTLY BE CRISIS THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING. AND WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE HOW LONG WOULD THE PROCESS BE FOR A NEW PROVIDER- WANTING TO. SECURE A LICENSE TO PROVIDE CHILD CARE SLOTS AND IS THERE DO YOU HOW MANY APPS DO HAVE APPLICATIONS FOR- EXPECT FOR FROM PROVIDERS TO EXPAND THEIR SLOTS. WE DO HAVE APPLICATIONS FROM PROVIDERS TO EXPAND THEIR SPOTS WE DO RECEIVE THOSE WE ALSO HAVE RECEIVED DURING THE PANDEMIC OF COURSE QUITE A FEW NOTICES THE CLOSURE FROM. PROVIDERS SO ARE KEY TO CONVINCING DIVISION PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON A REGULAR BASIS APPLICANTS- WHO ARE APPLYING FOR LICENSURE OR WHO ARE INTERESTED IN EXPANDING THEIR LIGHTS INJURE. THANK YOU WE DO ALSO TRACKED CLOSELY HAVE SHARED WITH YOU BEFORE THE CLOSURE DATA YEAH IF WE COULD JUST IF YOU COULD HAVE MY MAYBE WE CAN GET ON THAT A CALL OFF LINE I JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING GROWTH- IF I'M JUST TRYING TO STAND UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE AT. I'M SO MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT I ADDED A LITTLE LATER DATE- SO. IN CHILD CARE ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSING SOME CONCERNS WITH MANY OF THE COMBAT COMPONENTS- PROPOSED CHILD CARE EXPANSION PARTICULARLY WITH THE LACK OF RATE INCREASE THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PAY FOR CHILD. CARE PROVIDER IS ABOUT TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO DOLLARS SO HOW DO THEY PROPOSE STIPENDS IMPACT PROVIDERS COMPARED TO RATE INCREASES- THIS MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. WE'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO THIS TOPIC OUR- RATE REIMBURSEMENT AND WE LOOK. WE LOOK TO FURTHER TO FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ON THIS TOPIC AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ARE AT THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENT NOW OF THE- R. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SURVEY HOWEVER AS MENTIONED WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE DISCUSSION. SO DO YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STIPEND IS IT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OPEN- AND PROVIDING CARE PROVIDERS THAT WERE OPEN AT SOME POINT BUT NOW BE CLOSE BUT MAY NOW BE CLOSED OR- NEW PROVIDERS CLOSE PROVIDERS WHO'S GONNA BE ELIGIBLE. COOPER TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT THEIR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SECONDS WILL BE PROVIDED TO ALL LICENSED PROVIDERS. CURRENTLY OPENED OR IF THERE. IF THEY'RE CLOSE AND THINKING ABOUT RE OPENING I MEAN. THE PROVIDERS WERE OPEN AS OF JUNE. AS OF JUNE THANK YOU. NO FOR THE OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. YES SIR I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF MY FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON IN THESE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS IS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THESE KIND OF BIG NEW BUDGET PROPOSALS- YOU KNOW TAKING CENTER STAGE BUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE EXISTING PROGRAMMING I MEAN THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW. FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT HOW DO WE IMPROVE WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY- AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A BIG BIG FOCUS HERE- IN ADDITION PANDEMIC POLICIES MAY ACTUALLY BE CONTRIBUTING TO LIMITED ACCESS IN CHILD CARE THIS IS THE SHORTAGE OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHICH PRECEDED COVERT NINETEEN. HAS HAS ONLY BECOME WORSE. ADD IN THIS LAST YEAR AND LIKE EDUCATION RESTAURANTS IN OTHER SECTORS WHEN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO PAY WITHOUT REQUIRING WORK. OR SUBSIDIZES REDUCED WORKING LEVELS GUESS WHAT WE HAVE. A LABOR SHORTAGE. THE SO CALLED HARD HOLD HARMLESS POLICIES MAY ACTUALLY BE DOING MORE HARM. CREATING DISINCENTIVES FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO OFFER AND RECIPIENTS TO ACCESS. AND FULLY UTILIZE CHILD CARE. THE LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SLOTS ARE DEEMED FULL EVEN IF NOT BEING USED. LEAVING THOSE WHO ACTUALLY NEED AND WOULD USE CHILD CARE ON ON WAITING LISTS IT'S UNCLEAR HOW ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISE WILL ACTUALLY REVERSE THIS TREND AND ATTRACT THE THOUSANDS OF QUALIFIED NEW PROVIDERS NEEDED. I THINK THAT IS LIKE FRONT ROW CENTER WHAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON- WITH THIS. IN PARTICULAR RIGHT HERE WITH THIS MAY REVISED PROPOSAL SAUCEDA THE ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS DURING THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING THE CLOSURE. OF AN ESTIMATED FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED CHILD CARE HOMES IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO HUNDRED CHILD CARE CENTERS. HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATE IMPLEMENTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW SLOTS. IN THE NEW YEAR A HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE SLOTS. IT WILL BE- AT IT'S AN EXPANSION OF GENERAL CHILDCARE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAMS AND IT'S BEING PHASED IN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IT'S- IT'S AND WE- FULLY WERE FULLY COMMITTED TO THE HUNDRED CASE THOUGHT THAT THE HISTORICAL INVESTMENT AND AGAIN THEY WILL BE. A THERE THERE NOT ALL BEGINNING JULY FIRST THERE PHASED IN GRADUALLY. FINE I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU GONNA FILEM RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE SLOTS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE THAT WE CAN'T FILL- SO HOW YOU GONNA FILL THESE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHAT THE PHASE A MEN OR- WHATEVER. YOU NEED THE WORKERS WHERE YOU GONNA GET ON. I JUST WANT TO ADD TO IT SO I COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHARED SKEWED TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS A PART OF WHAT WE ARE INVESTING IN WITH RESPECT TO THE RELIEF PAYMENTS. BAD WE DISCUSSED BOTH THE STATE PLANS TO PROVIDERS TO ASSIST IN STABILIZING THE FIELD AS WELL AS THE- CHILD CARE. INITIATIVE PROJECT TO BUILD CAPACITY- AND WE DO ALSO HAVE QUITE A FEW WE INVEST AND UNMET NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WE THINK AND THERE ARE PROVIDERS TO MEET QUITE A FEW. OF OUR FAMILIES ALL SUPPLY AND FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS- FOR CARE PARTICULARLY IF THEY NEED CARE DURING WORK HOURS AND SO WE DO EXPECT. IT WILL BE PROVIDED IN THOSE SETTINGS AS WELL- BUT I MEAN JUST IS STILL DOESN'T GET TO MY QUESTION WHICH IS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T FILL THESE BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE WEIGHTLESS AND WE'VE LOST WE HAD. A BUNCH OF THESE CHILD CARE CENTERS CLOSE DOWN- YOU'RE DOING A HOLD HARMLESS POLICY WHICH PAYS THEM WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE OPEN OR NOT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE HAVING THE SAME HOURS OR NOT SO. I'M I'M SORRY I'M JUST VERY CONFUSED ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY INCREASE LOTS IN THIS CURRENT LABOR SHORTAGE THAT ARGUABLY YOU HELP CREATE. SO MR GALLAGHER I CAN LET ME JUST INTERJECT RIGHT HERE SO I THINK THAT YOU'RE RAISING A POINT BUT WE HERE HAVE TO YOU KNOW WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME. SO THE PANDEMIC IS COMING TO AN END WE'RE SEEING THIS ISSUE NOT JUST IN CHILD CARE CENTERS BUTTON. IN A PIZZA ESTABLISHMENTS AND RETAIL AND JOBS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT THEIR- UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS KEEPING THEM AT HOME IS IT A COMBINATION THAT FRANKLY THEY CAN'T GET CHILD CARE TO. THAT'S BY THE PROBABLY BIGGER ISSUE THEY CAN'T SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL SO IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M IS GONNA STAY HOME AND RIDE IT OUT AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THINGS ARE HAPPENING WITH THE RECOVERY OF COVER NINETEEN VACCINATIONS AND EVERYTHING AND WE'RE WE'RE CHANGING SO. THIS BUDGET OF COURSE. WE'RE ADOPTING A BUDGET THAT WOULD START JULY FIRST GO FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. BERASAL SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SO. WE'RE TRYING TO THINK LONG TERM NOW SO YOU'RE RIGHT. IF THE CURRENT. TREND CONTINUED LIKE WE ARE FOR COVER NINETEEN. IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE LONG TERM BUT- I THINK THAT WE'RE TO WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO LAY OUT- A REALITY THAT. YOU KNOW FOR CHILD CARE. PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA FOR YOU KNOW YEARS EVEN DECADES ABOUT A MASSIVE WAITING LIST. WHICH WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS. NOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW SLOTS I WILL NOTE THAT. THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET BLUEPRINT WHICH WE UNVEILED TWO WEEKS AGO. PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS WITH THE PLAN TO GET TO MILLION IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE SENATE. HAS A PLAN FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SO. WE THINK THAT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IS NOT AMBITIOUS ENOUGH SO WE pTHAT WE ADOPT OUR BUDGET. I'M NEXT WEEK BUT- I WILL NT LASTLY. THAT I WILL SAY THAT BOTH THE S. AND T. K. WHICH COMES NEXT THEY'RE NOT NEW PROGRAMS WE'RE NOT CREATING SOMETHING NEW AND YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. DOING WELL WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH GENERAL CHILD CARE. AND THE AND- THE- EXPANSION HERE. THE ALTERNATE PAYMENT PROGRAM AT EIGHT P. WHICH ARE. THE MAJORITY 99% OF THE SLOTS. OUR EXISTING PRODUCT WHICH HAVE MASSIVELY LISTS SO- SO I'VE I APPRECIATE THE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I AND I AGREE WITH YOU WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN RIGHT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LONG ERM. BUT WHAT I WANT TO I WANT TO HEAR THE ADMINISTRATION RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT SAME WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS IN A YEAR. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE SAYING IN THIS MAY REVISE IN A YEAR WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT A HUNDRED SLOTS PHASED IN. AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. CONSIDERING THE POLICIES THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE. RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT LABOR SHORTAGE I WANT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM YEAH. LIKE I THINK WE HAVE A PLAN I THINK THEY JUST LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THINGS WHAT I DID NOT SAY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT YEAH I THINK IT'S HARD TO ME JUST INTERJECT AGAIN BECAUSE- I THINK YOU YOU'RE- HAVING CONCERNS WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S DOING ON THE- SHUT DOWN OF THE ECONOMY AND OUR STATE AND- YOU KNOW. THAT'S NOT THEIR DECISION THEY RUN OUR CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE A DECISION. JUNE FIFTEENTH THINGS ARE GOING TO BE VERY VASTLY DIFFERENT IN THEIR WORK YOU KNOW SIX WEEKS AGO AND SIX MONTHS AGO SO. I THINK THINGS ARE CHANGING ANYWAY BUT I DON'T KNOW. I THINK YOUR ISSUE. OKAY BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS TO IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. NO IS IT TO THEM. THAT YOU CARE FOR ORDER YEAH JUST. KEEP WE HAVE A QUESTIONS. PERTAINING TO THE TOPIC. AT HAND. NOT NECESSARILY THE OVERALL. PANDEMIC IN THE GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSE TO IT. NOT I MEAN NO QUESTION. BECAUSE TO THIS WE HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS POLICIES YEAH. THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THIS BUDGET ITEM. IN CHILD CARE RIGHT AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE OPEN AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THEY'RE HAVING THE SAME HOURS AND- WHICH IS LEADING TO A LABOR SHORTAGE SO I'M ST NOW WE'RE GONNA SAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE SLOTS. THAT SOUNDS GREAT I WANT TO HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE CHILD CARE SLOTS BUT HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO IT CONSIDERING. THAT THE CLOSURES THAT WE'VE HAD AND THE LABOR SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. SIX WE HAD CITY YEARS- FINANCER SOCIAL SERVICES TALK ABOUT THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS WE HAD IN THE LAST FEW COVERED PLANS AND WHEN THOSE EXPIRE AND HOW THOSE. HOW THOSE- CANNOT RELATE AND- TIE INTO OUR EXPANSION HERE. YEAH I THINK IT MAY IT MAY BE HELPFUL JUST TO PROVIDE. A QUICK CLARIFICATION THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY IS NOT ABOUT PAYING PROVIDERS WHEN THEY ARE CLOSE THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY IS ABOUT WHEN THE PROVIDER REMAINS OPEN. AND THE CHILD DOES NOT ATTEND DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED- IT TO THE ENTIRE FAMILY SO THAT'S WHAT THE HOLD HARMLESS POLICY IS HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO KEEP NOT OPERATIONAL DAYS. THANK I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DESCRIBING THAT SAID THE CAPE NON OPERATIONAL DAYS ARE LIMITED TO SIXTEEN DAYS. SO THAT IS SPECIFIC TO CRISES THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC AND IT IS A- LIMITED NUMBER. OF DAYS SO- I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THEY DO ALSO THINK IT HELPS WITH THE DISCUSSION. OKAY ALL I WANT IS AN ANSWER LIKE HOW YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT'S IT. I DON'T THINK I'M ASKING SOMETHING CRAZY HERE. I UNDERSTAND THOSE POLICIES AND AGAIN AS I SAID THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT FACT IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT OPEN FOR A KID WHO'S NOT ATTENDING THAT MEANS SOME OTHER KID AND ANOTHER RECIPIENT WHO WANTS TO BE ABLE TO USE IT UTILIZE THE PROGRAM. CAN'T DO IT THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ON THE WAITING LIST. BUT AGAIN ADMINISTRATION YOU'RE THE ONE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO A HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU'RE PROMISING BIG THINGS. AND NOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT THAT'S MY THAT'S THE QUESTION. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SOLVE THIS LABOR SHORTAGE PROBLEM. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS CAPACITY IN THE FIELD FORGET TAKE UP THE SLACK AND THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FAMILIES WHO NEED FOR SLOTS AND THAT THOSE MATCHES WILL BE MADE AND THESE ARE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO WILL RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL. I THINK WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS LOOKING FOR IS CLARITY ON- AND- OFF ON THE GROUND SO. WILL THE DEPARTMENT BE CALLING FORMER PROVIDERS TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW THESE MONIES ARE AVAILABLE- WOULD YOU WANT TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW REOPENING- YOUR CENTER- WHAT ARE. IS WHAT IS THE PLAN TO RECRUIT FIT THE WORK FORCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH IN CHILD CARE- FINDING- QUALIFIED TEACHERS- AND CARE GIVERS- IS NOT EASY. SO WHAT IS THE PLAN TO RECRUIT THEM TO EVEN IF YOU ARE A PROVIDER THAT WANTS TO OPEN. AND YOU'RE APPROVED FOR FORTY EIGHT SLOTS- CAN YOU HIRE THE TEACHERS TO MEET RATIOS- THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE IS LOOKING TO SEE. IF WE WANT TO GET TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE ACTUAL PLAN- FOR ACTUALLY OPENING DOORS AT CENTERS. AND PAIRING FAMILIES ABOUT WITH PROVIDERS. WITH RESPECT TO LICENSE CAPACITY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE AT THIS POINT ARE ALMOST ABOUT A NET ZERO. AND IN TERMS OF THE LAST AND THE GAINES SO WE HAVE WE HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY AS YOUR KILEY DID AND WE HAVE BEEN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE POP UP CENTERS THAT HAVE. BEGUN AND WE ARE TRANSITIONING THEM FLEXING AND WE'VE HAD NEW PROVIDER. ARE COMING AND THAT THOSE ARE A VERY MINOR CHANGE IN THE OVERALL FEEL. HAVING SAID THAT WE HAVE BOB I WANTED TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY CHILD CARE AND THERE ARE INVESTMENTS IN THE BUDGET BUT ALSO DO FOCUS. ON HOW. THE CHILD CARE INITIATIVE PROJECT IN PARTICULAR THAT FUNDING IS INTENDED IT DOES INCLUDE. BOTH OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE TO FOR PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH BECOMING LICENSE. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE NON LICENSE OR LICENSE EXEMPT. CARE THAT IS PROVIDED SO I HOPE THOSE ARE HELPFUL CLARIFICATIONS TO- PRESIDENTIAL CONTACTS BUT- EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WE DO ALSO HAVE GROWTH THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE- OKAY LAST LAST QUESTION HERE. IS. YEAH WE PROPOSED FOR TKA OF WHICH- WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF WE'VE DONE A FOUR POINT 005% COAL INCREASE AND HERE WE'RE DOING A ONE POINT 7% CALL INCREASE SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE- DURING A VERY MINIMAL CALL INCREASE AND NO RATE INCREASE. RIGHT. IS THAT PROBLEMATIC TO. ENSURING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF PROVIDERS THAT WE NEED. EVEN JUST AN EXISTING PROGRAM. THE MAN. IS THAT A PART IN A FINANCE. OR WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT BE GREAT LET'S HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANSWER THAT AND THEN LET'S STAY ON THIS TOPIC FOR A BIT. YEAH WOULD THE REGIONAL MARK RATE- AGAIN. WORD CAN. TO INTO THE TOPIC. WE WORK- TO. FUTURE DISK. ABOUT THE- AS FOR THE- I DO NOT HAVE THAT IN. WITH ME AT THIS MOMENT. BUT I CAN BACK TEARS. OKAY THAT'S NOT HOME THE DEPARTMENT OF RAINY AND MOST HAPPY ADD ON AND- TO MISTER DEALERS RESPONSE. WHAT DID YOU LEARN FIRST JUST RIGHT NOW WITH THE COLA QUESTION WHY THE DIFFERENTIAL THERE. YEAH SO- D. AS I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO IS THE HEALTHIEST OF COLA WHICH WERE PROPOSING- AT FIVE POINT 007% AND IN THE BUDGET. AND THAT IS JUST DISTRICT CONTACTS THAT IS THE- COMPOUNDING OF THE TWO POINT ONE. ONE POINT 7% COLLECTING TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONE PERCENT- ADDITIONAL OUT ON THAT WE ARE PROPOSING- WITHIN THAT THE MAY REVISION- SO THE 1% OBVIOUSLY THE POLICY DECISION WHICH WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS AND THE IN THE K. TWELVE- FIVE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THAT COMPOUNDED COLA BETWEEN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- UNDERSTANDING THAT- THAT THE COLA DOES IMPACT THE APPLICATION OF COLA. TO THE TITLE FIGHT PROGRAMS DOES NOT INCREASE THE RATES FOR THOSE PROGRAMS- UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A CONTINUING CONVERSATION AS MY COLLEAGUES- DISCUSSED EARLIER REGARDING THE OVERALL RATE SYSTEM AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS OUT THERE. I'M SPECIFIC TO YOU KNOW BRING IN THE RACE TOGETHER AND HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THE ARE MARKED CONNECT TO THE S. R. R. AND WE ARE KEEPING BACK CALL LACK OF STATUTORY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ABOUT THE OVERALL RATE STRUCTURE. GIVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. MORE THAN JUST THE. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT'S DEAD THE PROBLEMATIC THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RATES. YOU KNOW FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS HERE AND SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION WE GOT A MONTH BEFORE WE GOT TO FINALIZE A BUDGET SO. ONE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS I GUESS GOING TO HAPPEN THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN HAPPENING I KNOW ON OUR END- AND WE'VE SEEN THE NEED FOR IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ATTRACT. MORE PEOPLE AND MORE PROVIDERS YEAH LET'S LET ME JUST ADD ON TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MR GALLAGHER AND 100% IN AGREEMENT THERE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES OF THE ASSEMBLY AND OUR BUDGET IS ADDRESSING THE RATES BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO WELL EVEN IF YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE EXISTING CHILD CARE WHERE WE HAVE NOW THE NUMBER OF SLOTS RATES AS A PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH YOU KNOW THE ECONOMIC FACTORS OF PAYING OUR EMPLOYEES DECENT WAGES YOU KNOW WE LOSE OUR WORK FORCE TO BETTER JOBS THAT COSCO IN AND OUT BURGER NOTHING AGAINST COSCO NOW BURGER BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAKE FINANCIAL CHOICES FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND IF. YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS SIZE TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS WE DON'T PAY THAT THAT WORKFORCE- YOU KNOW LIVING WAGE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE SO AND THEN WE WERE LOOKING ABOUT EXPANDING BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND POTENTIALLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SLOTS- AND- YOU KNOW HOW. IS THIS GOING TO WORK OUT IN LESS WE ADJUST. OUR RATE STRUCTURE SIMPLIFY IT WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THESE. BILLS WE'VE- BEEN CAUGHT LAST COUPLE YEARS- I KNOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS TALK ABOUT YOUR NEGOTIATING. WITH YOU KNOW THE UNION CONTRACTORS% PROVIDERS OUT THERE BUT REMIND YOU THAT A LOT OF THE- CHILD CARE FIELD OUT THERE IS NOT UNION WHETHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE- CBO'S IN COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR OF OUR UNIONIZED WORKFORCE AND NOW THAT'S THE LOG WITH THE LIMóN THE FROM TWO YEARS AGO AND RIGHTFULLY SO I'M GOING TO DO THAT BUT- THERE'S A BIG PIECE OF THE CHILD CARE FIELD THAT NEED THAT TOO. SO IF WE DON'T ADDRESS RATES. ALL THESE WORDS HERE ON THESE ON THE PLAN AND- THAT AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IF THAT WON'T WORK SO HOW DO YOU. ADDRESS. THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO I'LL DEFINITELY DEFERRED TO MY- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES COLLEAGUES TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL CHILD CARE- SYSTEM- UNDERSTANDING OF COURSE IN THE PRESCHOOL SIDE WHICH IS WHICH I CAN SPEAK TO- THAT THERE ARE SOME TOTAL BY PROVIDERS WHO ARE FAMILY CHILD CARE. PROVIDERS SO IT'S OKAY- THE CONVERSATION IS NOT QUITE SO CUT AND DRY AS- YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ARE REPRESENTED- AT THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS AND THOSE. WHO AREN'T THERE ACTUALLY ARE SOME REALLY TOUGH CAR PROVIDERS THAT PARTICIPATE NOT HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS. BUT BUT RECOGNIZING THAT. THESE CONVERSATIONS COUNTY HAD SEPARATELY FROM EACH OTHER THEY HAVE TO HAPPEN ALTOGETHER OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS AS WE AS WE HAVE TALKED. ABOUT FOR YEARS NOW AND- WITH YOU AND IF MCCARTY- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE IMPACTS THE WEEK REACHING THREE TO ONE AREA- AND DON'T CHANGE IN ANOTHER AREA SO. AGAIN WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS CONVERSATION HOLISTICALLY- AND THAT. ARE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION- YOU KNOW YOUR PRIORITIES AS WELL AS THE PARTIES OF THE SENATE. ON A MOVING FORWARD AND I WOULD JUST DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE SEPARATE HEALTH COMPONENT SERVICES FOR ANY KIND OF THING THEY HAVE. ON THE IMPACT OF CHILD CARE THE OVERALL CHILD CARE SYSTEM. BEFORE THAT THEY DO WE GET PAST THE EAGLES BEEN DELIVERING THESE CONTRACTS FOR YEARS THE THIRD LEVEL MORE GAMES. DO. YOU THINK THAT WE COULD EXPAND. SLY BY- THE HUNDRED DOLLAR OR MORE. WITH THE EXISTING GREAT STRUCTURE DO WE NEED TO INCREASE RIGHT. THEIR NUMBER MARKING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND ITS THOUGHTS VSAT IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHICH PART OF THE SYSTEM YOU'RE LOOKING NOT I DO THINK I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT RATES CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE. AND AS WE LOOK FOR ME THE REPORT I REALLY WANT TO KEEP MY COMMENTS ON THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND NOT ADDRESS THE CHILD CARE SITE THAT REALLY GETS DSS AS PER VIEW AT THIS POINT. SO FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM JUST TO MAINTAIN WHAT WE HAVE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE RATES ARE INCREASED WE KNOW THAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH KEEPING TEACHERS WITH HIRING TEACHERS WITH GETTING TEACHERS THAT ARE QUALIFIED. FOR THOSE THE TITLE FIVE STRUCTURE SO HARD OUT OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS HOW WE ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS SUPPORTED AT A RATE AND A FUNDING AMOUNT AND I THINK EARLIER MY TALKING POINTS I SPOKE TO THAT. IN NOT EVEN A FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME PROVIDER IS MAKING MORE FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD THAT OUR STATE SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND INTERSTATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS HAVE TO. DO MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS AND TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SERVICES TO THE PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN ACTUALLY ARE DELIVERING A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. AND STANDARDS AROUND SOME. OKAY I THANK I FORGOT TO PRESS THE ON BUTTON SO WE HEARD US HERE BUT PEOPLE AT HOME I WAS ASKING ABOUT- HOW COULD WE INCREASE LOTS WITHOUT CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASE RATES AND WE CAN WE CAN GO ON THIS I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT CRYSTAL CLEAR THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE. IN THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET- WE WON'T PUSH FOR AND GO FOR WITH THE BUDGET LAST WEEK. THAT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS- THE RATE STRUCTURE FOR EASY PROGRAMS. FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THESE ISSUES MR O'DONNELL. JUST A QUICK QUESTION I MAY HAVE HEARD IT RIGHT I MAY HAVE HEARD IT INCORRECTLY. HI THIS QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE WERE SOME LA- COMMENTS IF I INTERPRET THEM CORRECTLY THAT. STEVE THE FEDERAL FUNDS- PROPOSED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE CANNOT BE USED FOR CONSTRUCTION OR LAND PURCHASE IS THAT ACCURATE. SO DIFFIDENT POINT READY INFRASTRUCTURE WERE MADE BEFORE AFTER OKAY GUIDANCE WITH AVAILABLE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK FURTHER INTO THIS AS NEW FEDERAL GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE. OKAY THANK YOU OKAY. AND THEN JUST LASTLY I WANT TO KNOW THAT LMAO MENTIONED- THE- FEDERAL MONEY AND POTENTIALLY DECREASING NUMBER OF SLOTS AND I THINK WE AND OUR BUDGET- RECOGNIZE OUT YEAR REVENUES AND PEGGED THESE TOWARDS MAKING SURE THIS IS A PRIORITY. TO INCREASE LOT SLIDE THIS YEAR IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL. SO THESE ISSUES ISSUES WE WILL HOLD OPEN CERTAINLY OF TOP PRIORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY BUT WE WON'T TAKE ACTION TODAY. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE UP PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE INCLUDING. THE T. K. THROUGH TWELVE BUDGET- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND SO FORTH. PRESS START WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA IN NCD.

MODEST GROWTH OVER THE PERIOD OF WITH MOST. DOWNWARD CHANGE ARE PROTECTED THE MAYOR VISION BEING ASSOCIATED WITH RECENT GUIDANCE THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET- REGARDING ACCESS HE WRAPPED DISTRIBUTION. BURKE GUARANTEED TOTALED IN THE PRIOR YEAR GUARANTEE ABOUT SEVENTY NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

IS NOW WITH OUR INCLUDING- THE WHAT WAS PROPOSED THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS EQUAL TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF TOTAL GENERAL FUND REVENUES. WHICH OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD PROPOSED TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND NOW THE BIGGER VISION THIS PROPOSING TO REMOVE BOTH THE NOT HERE AS WELL AS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUAL TO ABOUT TWO POINT SIX. BILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ON TOP OF THAT. NINETY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION. AMOUNT WHAT. THE ONE AMOUNTS OF FAR EXCEEDING THE CALCULATED TECH TO.

SIMILAR TO OUR ASSUMPTION THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS AMOUNT OF A RESERVE BALANCE WOULD TRIGGER THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE CAPS PER STATUTE BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE.

ARE I WILL LEAVE A COMMENT AT THAT BUT I HAVE OF MYSELF AND SEVERAL COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ANY. AFTER THE REST OF THE PANEL OF GETTING. OKY THANK YOU L. A. L. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN GET ON WITH THE LEGEND WITH OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A SHORTHAND OUT THAT OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE THIS MORNING- BACK IN JANUARY YOU HEARD US SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN THE BIGGEST NEED YOUR INCREASE IN CASE FOURTEEN FUNDING IN THE HISTORY OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. AND THIS MAYOR VISION CONTINUED RIGHT IN THAT SAME VEIN BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE CAR YOU ALSO REPRESENT. THE% BIGGEST INCREASE IN FUNDING BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY- THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. OTHER PROMINENT FINANCE MENTIONED THE SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION INCREASE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THAT'S OVER THE NINETEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. YEAH AND AGAIN THAT'S REFLECTING ABOUT 40% OF THE INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES- AS REQUIRED BY- THAT TEST ONE FORMULA THAT SET THE SIDE. UP 40% THE STATE REVENUE. AFTER SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE- SOLID STARTING POINT FOR BUILDING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- WE ALSO THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS REASONABLE AS WELL- THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THIS YEAR IS ABOUT AS FAR ABOVE THE CREEK AND DEMOCRATS HOLD. NOW AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BELOW THE CREEK ENDEMIC LEVEL BACK AND YOU AND- AND SO THE RECOVERY THAT THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WERE INTENDED TO ACCOMPLISH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. ALSO THE TOTAL INCREASE IN FUNDING- IN THIS MAY REVISION IS FIFTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION THAT'S THE SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION INCREASING THE GUARANTEE. LESS THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION US UP ON A PAYMENT. THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. I ENTER OF THE- STRUCTURE OF THIS BUT FIGURE STUFF. I WOULD NOT I THINK ON PAGE STUFF OF HEARING. AGAIN TO GIVE YOU GOOD OVER. I SAW THE BACK. THE HIGHER PROP NINE EIGHT GUARANTEE. I MAKES THE HIGHER REQUIRED RESERVE DEPOSIT AND THEN ALLOCATE 789% OF THE REMAINING FUNDS TO SQUIRRELS AND THE WEAPON PERCENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES- ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S. HEALTH PRACTICE. FOR ALLOCATING INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEED. I DON'T CARE A LOT ABOUT THE COMING COLLEGE. I'LL TOMORROW SO OFTEN JUST ON THE NEED TO KEEP CHANGES. ARE YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD LITTLE OVER SEVENTEEN POINT THREE BILLION YEN HECALLED PROPOSALS- THIS MAY REVISION ADDS ANOTHER TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION IT NEW PROPOSALS ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT. SO THE TOTAL PACKAGE BEFORE YOU AT ABOUT THIRTY BILLION IN. TOTAL K. TWELVE- PROPOSALS- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO ALLOCATE NEARLY TWENTY FOUR BILLION OF THAT FOR A ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. AND SIX BILLION FOR ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE MAKING MVING PIECES- FOR THE ONGOING FUNDS ALMOST ALL OF THAT IS RELATED TO. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IF THE FIVE POINT 007% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT INCLUDING A 1% ADDITIONAL BASE INCREASE FOR ALL DISTRICTS. AS WELL AS THE AUGMENTATIONS I TO THE CONCENTRATION GRANT AND THEN A NEW FUNDING STREAM- FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- THAT WOULD INCLUDE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ACTUALLY SUMMER ENRICHMENT- CURRENT. CURRENTLY STRUCTURED TO BE SEPARATE FROM THE LCF DEATH BUT IT COULD BE FOLDED. INTO THE FORMULA OVER TIME. TO WHAT THERE ARE BIG ON. ARE COMPARED WITH JANUARY THAT'LL HAVE THESE ARE BOTH ONE. I WON AS THE COMMUNITIES. WE PROGRAM. I THINK THAT THIS MAY REVISION PROVIDES A TOTAL OF THREE BILLION FOR THAT PROGRAM. STEP TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SETS ASIDE ABOUT 70% OF THAT AMOUNT. TO CREATE YOU COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND 30% FOR EXPANDING- AND CONTINUING EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. ANOTHER MAJOR AUGMENTATION AND FOCUSES ON THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE- THIS MANAGING HAS ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION FOR PREPARATION TRAINING AND RETENTION ACTIVITIES THAT'S AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE BILLION COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ONE OF THE- BIGGEST COMPONENT OF THAT PIECE OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS COULD USE. A TO FIND A RANGE OF TRAINING- COACHING AND MENTORING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. FOR TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AS WELL AS CLASSIFIED STAFF- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MATCHING THE SCORE WE OPENING PROPOSED SO THIS IS ANOTHER TWO BILLION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES- THESE FUNDS DISTRICTS COULD USE THESE FUNDS FOR RANGE OF ACTIVITIES- THAT WOULD INCLUDE TESTING FOR- I THINK THE BETTER RESPECTS INITIATIVES- CLEANING- RECONFIGURING FACILITY IS. INCLUDE MEDITATION- PERSPECTIVE EQUIPMENT- REALLY ARRANGED ACTIVITIES FOR THE OPENING SCHOOLS. AGAIN SEPARATE FROM THAT REALLY ACTION TWO BILLION THAT. YOU PUT APPROVED BACK IN MARCH. THERE'S ALSO EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION FOR PAYING DOWN THE PEARLS THAT IS AN INCREASE OF ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION- COMPARED WITH. THE GOVERNOR GENERAL BUDGET BUT WHAT THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN THE FOR ALSO MEANING AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE BIG MULTI YOUR PROPOSAL IS THE ONE I RELATED TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- SO THE GOVERNOR WOULD MAKE ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS ELIGIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- CONCLUDING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. A FOCUS JUST ON THE FISCAL SIDE OF THAT- THE FUNDING THE ONGOING FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS BUT THIS PROGRAM WOULD COME THROUGH MAKING THE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE TO GENERATE ATTENDANCE TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES STATUS NO COSTS- THAT BY. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WOULD TOTAL ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION. AND THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES TO INCREASE OR WHAT WE CALL REVENGE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE TO COVER THOSE COSTS. SO RATHER THAN PAYING FOR. IT IF NOT I'LL SEE AT THE OFFICE YOUR EXISTING GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE. OF THE STATE WOULD PAY FOR IT BY. INCREASING THE GUARANTEE AND ESSENTIALLY TRYING DOWN NONPROFIT ASIAN AND YET FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT. A SEPARATE FROM THOSE BASE COST THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE ADULT THE CHILD RATIOS- THIS WOULD PROVIDE THIS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE WANTED ADDITIONAL US CERTIFICATE A CLASSIFIED STAFF FOR EXTENDING EACH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM. THE FINANCE ESTIMATES DIVISIONAL COSTS WOULD TOTAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND UNLIKE THE BASE COST THE STATE WOULD PAY FOR THOSE COSTS WITHIN EXISTING GROWTH OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT RETENTION- THIS BILL DECISION I THINK REALLY COMES DOWN TO- THE TRADEOFF- AND YOUR PRIORITIES WITHIN THE BROADER STATE BUDGET CONTEXT- I UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PREVENTION IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS ALLOWABLE B THE CONSTITUTION. WE DON'T THINK IT'S- THAT REQUIRED IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THAT OVER TIME THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROGRAMS. AND LESS ON NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PROGRAMS AND SO- THAT'S JUST SOMETHING PRETTY TO THINK ABOUT IN. DEVELOPING. A MULTI YEAR STRUCTURE OF THIS BUDGET. HI THERE TWO POINT SIX- FOR. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- THIS IS FINDING THAT WOULD DRAW FROM A COUPLE DIFFERENT POTS OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND SIX HUNDRED MILLION WHAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING- FOR THIS TARGETED INTERVENTION GRANT DISTRICTS COULD USE THE FUNDS TO PAY FOR A- WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES. INTENSIVE TUTORING ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL TIME- OTHER TEXAS SUPPORTS BY THE FEDERAL OF THIS. COULD BE USED TO REMEMBER SIX- BACK TO THE STATE OF THE PANDA. OR EXPENSE- THE STATE. COULD BE USED FOR X. JUST INCUR AFTER. JULY FIRST OF. TWO TWENTY ONE. I TURNED INTO A ASSESSMENT WE THINK THIS IS HAS SOMEONE FOR. SO IT DOES INCLUDE SOMETHING AUGMENTATION FOR AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN. A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES A NUMBER OF YEARS I THE BEST THING OF THE ARE INCREASE RIGHT HI THE INCREASES. FOR ACTORS AND LEARNING TIME. AND THEN ADDITIONAL. I THIS SUPPORT. I STRUCTURALLY THIS BUT ALSO. A LARGE ONE TIME BECAUSE- OF THE KICKOFF. THE CPAS. US. TO TWENTY ONE FOR TWO. I'M MORE THAN FOUR TWO BILLION IN FOUR ONE TEN ACTIVITY. AND COMBINING THAT AMOUNT WITH THE PROPER NINETY EIGHT WITH DEPART. AND SOMEONE TEN COMMITTEE CALL SPEND. THIS BUDGET AT THE TONE ONE TIME. A NEARLY SAID BILLION. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS. BECAUSE IF THEY HEARING WORK DROP NOT YEAR. THAT ONE TIME PRESSURE. BUT THE STATE OF WAITING MAKE CUTS TO ON BLANCA. OR I MEAN. TURNING BACK TO DEFER. IF THE GUARANTEE DOESN'T DROP IT. THAT'S FUNNY FREE TO NEXT YEAR YOU CAN ADD USE THAT ADDRESS. A NEW ISSUE IS A QUITE. AND IT INCLUDES A ONE TIME INCENTIVE FUNDING BUT IT WASN'T CLEAR- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO GO WITH THAT PROPOSAL. AND WE WEREN'T SURE WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WAS- THIS MAY REVISION HAS A FAIRLY AS A CLEAR END GOAL AND- A CLEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN- THERE'S BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDING THAT LINES UP WITH- THE COST DISTRICTS ONE CREATED INCREASE THESE PROGRAMS. AND SO IT'S MUCH- I THINK IT'S A MUCH MORE DEVELOPED A PROPOSAL- THERE ARE SOME DETAILS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE STILL TO THINK ABOUT LIKE. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO LOOK LIKE THAT PROGRAM CURRENTLY SERVES MANY FOUR YEAR OLDS. I PERSONALLY WILL SERVE MUCH FEWER OF THEM. I ONCE THAT I WILL OUT OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BEGINS. BUT OVERALL- THIS IS STRONGER PROPOSAL I THINK WE ALSO THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROPOSAL AND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUE I TOOK A LOOK. ON MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT THAT. IN ONE OF THE NEXT PANELS. BUT TO OUR CONCERN. GOING TO FLY. AFTER PROPOSAL FOR YOU ONE IS THE TWO POINT SIX BILLION. FOR TARGETED INTERVENTION AND THE SECOND TO GET THE TWO BILLION FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES. DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. ADJUSTING LEARNING LOSS AND- HEALTH AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS MORE THAN SIX BILLION STATE FUNDS. AND THOUGH THAT EIGHT PREVIOUS. CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THESE TWO MOST RECENT PROPOSALS. INCLUDING TARGETED INVENTION INTERVENTION IS LIKE KIND OF TUTORING AND ACTIVITIES- TO OPEN SCHOOLS. AND WE ARE CONCERNED IS THAT THESE TWO PROPOSALS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING. I WITHOUT IT THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. A LEADING UP TO THE MAY REVISION WHAT WE HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT THAT DISTRICTS HAVE NOT SPENT ALL OF THE ONE TIME FUNDED THEY'VE ALREADY RECEIVED CITIES ACTIVITIES. AND ALTHOUGH THEY FACE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH THE OPENING SCHOOLS MAKING UP PREVENTING LOSS. THOSE DON'T SEEM TO STEM FROM A LACK OF ONE TIME FUNDING. IN FACT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK FOR MANY DISTRICTS IS FINDING EFFECTIVE WAYS TO USE THE FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED. SO WE THINK YOU COULD REJECT BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS. AND USE THOSE. FREED UP FUNDS FOR HIGHER PRIORITIES. LASTLY WE THERE IS A MISTER. IN THIS MAYOR TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON BUILDING SCHOOL DISTRICT- BUDGET RESILIENCY- SPECIFICALLY LEAVING TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND APPROACH THE MEANING- THAT SECOND STEP THE CONCERN TO US- IT'S A CONTRAST TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE. ALL OF THOSE DEFERRALS ARE PAID DOWN WE THINK THAT'S MORE PROMISING APPROACH AND WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING. THAT SAME APPROACH FOR. K. TWELVE EDUCATION- THE BUDGET ALSO HAVE- ANY PROPOSALS RELATED TO LONG TERM INCREASES AND PENSION COSTS. AND IN PREVIOUS YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PROPOSALS AND WE'VE SEEN- BASED ON THAT ARE MAKING OUT OF LARGE ONE TIME PAYMENT IN ONE YEAR CAN PROVIDE SAVINGS OVER A NUMBER OF DECADES AND REALLY HELP ADDRESS AND STABILIZE DISTRICT BUDGETS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. AND I THINK. I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ONE REASON WE BRING UP THIS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET- RESILIENCY CONCERN ISN'T JUST ABOUT- IS BEING A GOOD FISCAL PRACTICE ALTHOUGH WE THINK THAT CLEARLY IS A CONCERN AND I COULD. JUST CONSIDERATION. BUT ALSO WE THINK THAT THE BENEFITS STUDENTS BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD. THAT THE PROGRAMS DISTRICTS CREATE OVER THE COMING YEAR WITH ALL OF THIS ONE TIME FUNDING THE RECEIVING. THAT THOSE PROGRAMS CAN BE SUSTAINED. OVER TIME OVER A LONGER PERIOD AND THROUGHOUT AN ECONOMIC CYCLE. BOB SO CAN DOWN THE PEARLS ACTUALLY SOMETHING PENSIONS WOULD BOTH THAT WOULD LEAVE PREPARE BOTH THE STATE AND DISTRICTS- THE BETTER DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE ECONOMIC. UNCERTAINTY ON THE ECONOMIC UPS AND DOWNS. FIRST OF ALL STOP THEIR MICHAEL IS A GROUP SOME ADDITIONAL COMPANY PANEL BUT WE HAVE THE ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY YOU THAT NEXT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ELLIE GARNER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TEMPERAMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO MAKE EDUCATION A TOP PRIORITY IN HIS BUDGET. MANY OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE NEIGHBORING VISION ALIGNED WITH THE SHARED GOALS OF THE SSD I. ENSURING EQUITABLE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS AND CREATING A FOCUS ON STUDENTS HIT HARDEST DURING THIS PANDEMIC. OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. USE THAT THE NAY REVISED INCLUDES THE HIGHEST EVER HELLO FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND THE LARGEST K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THE COMPANY NINETEEN CABINET HAS BRIGHTENED THE OPPORTUNITY GAP SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS IN THE WEEKS AHEAD TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE THE TO CLOSE OPPORTUNITY GAPS TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS RETURNED SAFELY TO SCHOOL FOR IN PERSON LEARNING AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXCEL. WE WOULD JUST REQUEST AS WAS ELECTED LEADER TO AN INCH AND THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED THE SAME COLOR FOR CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AS FOR THE LCS MATH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. BUT SECURELY TO THE EXTENT ADDITIONAL REVENUES IDENTIFIED WOULD REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE INCREASING THE CALL OF FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ONLY RECEIVE A ONE POINT 7% COLLAPSE AS OPPOSED TO THE FOUR POINT OH SEVEN. SPECIAL EDUCATION OR THE FIVE POINT OH SEVEN FOR LCS. THERE WERE MANY GREAT PROPOSALS AND ANY REVISION THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH IS THE UNIVERSAL TRANSITION. A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL STAR NOVEL MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL GRANT TO YOU HEARD FROM ALREADY. IS HERE TO PRESENT ON THE UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL. SEMI TO AT LEAST THEIR NOVEL MARC AND- REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. AS WE MENTIONED ON THE LAST PANEL THAT MAY REVISED PROPOSAL TO HAVE UNIVERSAL TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE. BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IS BOTH HISTORIC AND EXCITING. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO PRESENTS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRE K. THROUGH THIRD GRADE ALIGNMENT ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO EXPRESS SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN PRESCHOOL AND I TRUST THINGS LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WE HOPE THAT THIS IS A STARK INVESTMENT WILL THAT CALIFORNIA'S SERVE MANY MORE. AT THE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS BUT NOT SERVED ITEM. THERE ARE CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT MUSTBE ADDRESSED TO MAKE SURE THAT UNIVERSAL TKA WORKS FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY. EXPANSION OF T. K. AS WELL AS STABILIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. CREATES AN URGENT NEED FOR AN ESTIMATED THOUSANDS OF NEW TEACHERS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS ARE PUT INTO PLACE TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING PRESCHOOL WORK FORCE AND OTHERS. TO FILL THESE JOBS SINCE IT IS INDIVIDUALS HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE ARE THE FIRST. AND DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE IN THEIR FIELDS. AND THAT THAT EQUITABLE COMPENSATION AS WELL AS BENEFITS. THE TICKET EXPERIENCE MUST BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. WITH PROPER SUPPORT TICKET CLASSROOMS CAN SUPPORT INTENTIONAL LEARNING THROUGH PLAY. WHICH GO HAND IN HAND WHEN EDUCATORS ARE QUICK BUT THOUGHTFUL SEQUENCED CURRICULA AND HAVE THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO SUPPORT CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AFRICOM TAXED. HE CAME MOST ALL SUPPORT FAMILIES NEEDS AND PRINT CHOICE. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSAL AROUND. UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL FOR TEEKAY FAMILIES IN MANY SCHOOLS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO SUPPORT S. AND WE APPRECIATE EXPANDED EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. NEED TO HAVE LOWER ADULT CHILD RATIOS AND BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. EXCELLENT OPTION THAT MANY PARENTS WILL CHOOSE FOR THEIR CHILDREN SO LONG AS THAT IS DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND GEOGRAPHICALLY ACCESSIBLE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE THE MATH OF PARENTAL CHOICE IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR WHAT IT IS. CURRENTLY MANY PARENTS ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE BETTER EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY ACCESSIBLE. HOURS THAT THERE NEEDS. FOR THE COST FACTORS ENSURING THAT T. K. LEADS TO AN OVERALL EXPANSION ACCESS TO THE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES INSTEAD OF A LOSS OF CAPACITY. THIS WILL REQUIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THOUGHTFUL PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS IN NEEDS SIXTEEN COMMUNITY BASED INFRASTRUCTURE PRIVATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE SPACE AS WELL AS STAFF AND EXPERTISE SERVING AT THESE COMMUNITIES. WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT FACILITIES AND PLANNING SUPPORT ALONG WITH SUPPORT FOR THE PRE SCHOOL LEARNING FOUNDATIONS AND ADDRESSING CURRICULUM. WILL NEED TO BE OPERATIONALIZED FOR THIS AND- WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOU ON THESE PROPOSALS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THEM AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS WE WORK TOWARDS FINALISING. PACKAGES FINALLY WE WANT TO FLAG THE MAY WEEK THAT THEY MAY REVISED PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT NEW WORKLOAD AROUND UTK THE PRESCHOOLER RENDITIONS AND THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE. WITHOUT CORRESPONDING NEW STATE OPERATIONAL FUNDING WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE WEBSPHERE THAT WE WILL NEED TO INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE I NEEDED RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THE. ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD INCLUDED. THIS CONCLUDE OUR REMARKS FROM THANK HAVE DEPARTMENT OF ITS- THANK YOU FOR. OKAY THANK. THANK YOU- THAT WRAPS IT UP FOR IN THE PRESENTERS NOW WILL GO TO- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM MANY MEMBERS ALL START WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER RANTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FIRST I WANT TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR. IN THIS MAY REVISE FOR THE MONUMENTAL INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION SYSTEM THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN HERE LIKE THE EXTENDED AND EXPANDED LEARNING. UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND THE FUNDING FOR EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS- ROLE IN PROVIDING FOR AND PUSHING FOR T. K. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS I HAVE HEARD FROM MANY OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND WOULD LIKE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE MIXED DELIVERY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IN THE BARDEN PROPOSAL WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE. AGAIN THE CHAIRS WORKING WITH THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE POSSIBILITIES WHEN WE LOOK AT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PROVIDERS. WE'RE THE ONES THAT WERE THE FRONT LINE WORKERS THEY WERE THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE THE ONES THAT KEPT EVERYTHING GOING PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE. AND THEY DESERVE TO BE RECOGNIZED AND COMPENSATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED. ANOTHER AREA IS OUR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN I'VE HEARD FROM MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I KNOW THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT I DO WANT TO BRING THIS UP NOW- ARE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN. NEED ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS- THE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET TO DEAL WITH THIS- AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT. THEIR VOICES AND THEIR NEEDS ARE HEARD AND THAT WE HEED THEIR PLEAS BECAUSE IT ISN'T JUST A REQUEST THEY ARE PLEADING WITH US TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN. IT WITH REGARD TO THE CHILD CARE- VERY SPECIFICALLY PROVIDING THE RATE INCREASES. FOR THE PROVIDERS ACCESS ACROSS ALL CARE SETTINGS. AND TO ELIMINATE THE FAMILY FEES. BUT MOST IMPORTANT I THINK THAT IT'S  WORKING COLLABORATIVELY SO THAT OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS PROTECTED. WELL WE MOVE FORWARD WITH RTK. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK REQUIRES LEADERSHIP. AND THAT IS WHY PERSONALLY I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHAIR. OF FROM FROM THE SUB COMMITTEE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THAT. THANK YOU SOMEONE NEVER KNOW YOU HAVE MAJORITY LEADER DUTIES TODAY SO YOU'RE IN AND OUT OF THE COMMITTEE BUT- WHAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM YOU ON THIS ISSUE THAT YOU'RE- OFFENDED TO. I FELL OF BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AS WELL AND- I'LL HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS WILL BE START WITH A COMMITMENT MISTER DONALD HE HAD- YES THANK YOU- A LONG PRESENTATION BECAUSE IT'S A LONG LIST- BUT AGAIN I THINK WE'RE HEADING CERTAINLY IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION WE WOULD ALL AGREE. PHAM ALL JUST HAVE A FEW A FEW QUESTIONS HERE- THIS ONE IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE SUB MODEL PLANET OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THERE WAS AGREEMENT AMONG STAKEHOLDERS THAT. WE WILL CONTINUE ON WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL A PAYMENT IN ORDER TO RAISE THE FLOOR PROP NINETY EIGHT WHY ARE WE ABANDONING THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AT THIS TIME. YOU'RE SEEKING TO MOTIONS AND- PROPOSING TO. COURSE AREA ARE OF FINANCE ALL TAKE A ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO IF YOU RECALL GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAD. AT THE BUDGET ACT OF LAST YEAR I BATES ARE CALCULATED THAT THE CRIME THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THE TEST ONE CALCULATED AMOUNT ATTACHED TO CALCULATING AMOUNT IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE TESTS TO CALCULATE MY WAS GOING TO BE OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE PAST ONE CALCULATED AMOUNT CUMULATIVELY- WITH NO MECHANISM- UNDER CURRENT LAW FOR SCHOOLS TO REGAIN NOT FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS- IN THE GUARANTEE OF A JETS. ATTACHED TO WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH HIGHER WE WOULD FUND IT AT ONE- AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT LOST RELATIVES TO AMOUNTS OF THE WAS THE MAIN MAJOR IMPETUS BETWEEN RESTORING ORIGINAL MODEL PAYMENTS ARE MEANT TO RESTORE THAT TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS. NOW AS- MY COLLEAGUE CAN THAT THE L. A. L. MENTIONED. IN PART WITH. BOX INCLUDED DIFFERENT IS NO LONGER A NAY TOLD POINT FOUR BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A CALL. NINE THREE THREE. AND SO AT THE- BACK WAS THE MAIN- THINKING ABOUT BEHIND. US REMOVING A COUPLE NAY PAYMENTS ALTOGETHER THANK ARE NOW BACK ON A TRAJECTORY MUCH MORE SO. TO IT NOT BY THAN. WHAT WE HAD US- I THINK BUDGET. OF TWENTY TWO ONE. THE COMPANY PANDEMIC AND ALL THE ASSOCIATED. ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE AFTER THAT ADDITIONALLY. I MENTIONED AS WELL THERE IS EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN. EXTRA BATTLE THAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD- GOING BACK TO. K. FOURTEEN SCHOOLS AND PROBABLY 8485% OF THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO K. TWELVE SCHOOLS I JUST ON THE BASIS THAT THE MOMENT- AND NOT. LARA DISCRETIONARY FUND FOR THEM THEY ARE SO BUT WAS THAT ALL OF EVERYTHING I MENTIONED AND THEN WITH THE FACT THAT DOLLARS THE BEFORE ONE BILLION- AND ALL THE COMPUTER PARTY WITHIN THE BY. AT LARGE- THAT. WHAT MADE THE MOST FOR US THE MAYOR VISION HEARING WHICH ALSO. ALLOWED DO DIRECT- TRULY UNPRECEDENTED OF RESOURCES FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS AS THEY NAVIGATE BOTH FIVE RESPONDED PANDEMIC AND ALSO OF COURSE JUST. RISING FIXED COSTS THAT ARE A PART BECAUSE THE DOING BUSINESS THAT THEY HAVE ON. ON WHAT BASIS. THANK YOU BUT BUT THE AGAIN THERE'S NO. THAT THE SET THAT THE THAT THE TRAJECTORY WE ARE ON WILL EXCEED THE SUPPLEMENT PAYMENTS THAT OCCUR. WELL I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY BACK. WELL YEAH THAT'S CORRECT IF WE IF THE REGULAR ON. MAY OR MAY NOT NEED IF WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE APPLIED THE PROBLEM ON A PAYMENT IN EACH YEAR ON TOP WO POINT SIX BILLION GROWING TO WHATEVER IT WOULD WORK OUT TO BE NOT YEAH BUT- THAT FACTOR. THANK YOU. BOB WITH REGARD TO THE COLD IT'S GOOD I'VE I'D LIKE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER MAYBE. TWO APPLIED OF TO MORE PROGRAMS TO TOOK TO THE OTHER CREDIT TO OTHER CATEGORICAL- I MEAN FOR A LONG LIST YOU'RE SO EXCUSE ME FROM. TAKING TO FIND MY THOUGHTS HERE- WITH REGARD TO REOPEN SCHOOLS MORE MONEY FOR RE OPENING SCHOOLS TO SCHOOLS NEED REALLY NEED MORE MONEY TO RE OPEN. WE GAVE THEM A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ALREADY TO REOPEN. AND IF THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT THEY DIDN'T REOPEN SO THEY WOULD NEED THE MONEY SO WHAT WOULD THEY NEED MORE MONEY FOR NOW. PROBABLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HIS DESK HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE VISION INCLUDES THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND HEALTH AND SAFETY GRANTS ON TO AUGMENT WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED SO AB EIGHTY SIX INCLUDED- TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THOSE ELEAZAR THAT OPENED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- CAN AND IS AVAILABLE INTO THE INTO THE BUDGET YEAR BUT WAS REALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS THAT COULD BE TESTING IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL AND LIAISE ON THE BASIS THAT THE PROPORTION OF LCF BATH- ARE AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE AND ALI IT'S FOR WORK IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR STILL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS AB EIGHTY SIX. AND REST TO THE- THE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THE ELEAZAR- ARE RECEIVING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THOSE ARE GOING OUT ON THE BASIS OF TITLE ONCE OR NOT- CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE TO ALL AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK THAT THAT POLICY CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IN ENCOURAGING FAMILIES TO RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE. PROPERLY RESOURCE TO PROVIDE THAT INSTRUCTION AND HOW HEALTHY AND SAFE MANNER. OKAY- COMMONWEALTH I HOPE WE'RE TRACKING HE EXPENDITURES OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE WE ALREADY DOLED OUT OF BEEN EXPENDED. SO WE'RE NOT JUST ADDING ON MORE MONEY WHAT IT MIGHT. AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS MIGHT NOT IN FACT BE NEEDED YOUR MONITORING THAT ASPECT I ASSUME. CORRECT SO SPECIFICALLY WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS THERE IS A FEDERAL THERE'S A MONITORING REQUIREMENT. OF EXPENDITURES FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS- IN REGARDS TO THE STATE FUNDS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO PUT OUT- AND THAT ALLOWABLE EXPENDITURES TO BE CAUGHT- THROUGH THE AUDIT PROCESS. PROPELLERS ALLOWABLE EXPENDITURES THOSE TRACKING THE DOLLARS SPENT. AYE AYE YOU YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRACKING THE DOLLARS THAT IS A STATE TO. TRACKING THE DOLLARS IT HAS SPENT FOR BERMAN SPENT RE OPENING. SO THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR RE OPENING- HAVE RECALL HAVE AS TRACKING REQUIREMENTS ATTACHED TO THEM THAT THE STATE IS- ADMINISTERING SO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN WORKING ON THE FEDERAL TRACKING REQUIREMENTS- IN TERMS OF THE STATE FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE- I WOULD DEFER. FOR THE EIGHTY SIX BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT STP- AND- IN TERMS OF WHAT KINDS OF TRACKING THEY'RE DOING. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE INCLUDED IN THAT LANGUAGE- A SPECIFIC MECHANISM AROUND TRACKING THE EXPENDITURES FOR THOSE FUNDS BEYOND WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE CAPTURED AND- FOR EXAMPLE ON THE STOCK SYSTEM. THE KICK IN THE REAR I AM IS BECAUSE MAYBE. THEY DON'T NEED THE MONEY AND THE MONEY COULD BE PUT TO A- SOME OTHER USED TO CD HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. I'M SORRY AT. A SOMEONE CAN YOU SHARE YOUR QUESTION AGAIN I'M NOT THESE. I'M SORRY WHAT THE QUESTION AGAIN. YES PLEASE OKAY YOUR QUESTIONS ARE YOU TRACKING THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO DISTRICT FOR REOPENING SCHOOLS THERE'S A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT WE TRACK THE FEDERAL DOLLARS BUT EVERY TRACKING THE STATE DOLLARS THAT HAVE GONE TO SCHOOLS RE OPENING AND THE CONTEXT IS ASKING WHY ARE WE GIVING SCHOOLS MORE MONEY IF WE'RE NOT SURE IF THEY EVEN NEEDED NOW THEY VERY WELL MAY. I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T AS MUCH THEM DO WE HAVE DATA RELATIVE TO THIS. STILL V. LEGISLATION AT THE EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX LEGISLATION. ONLY REQUIRED A FINAL REPORT WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY TRACKING. ON HOW THE SPENT THE HOW DOLLARS ARE GOING OUT I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT BUT- THOSE ARE JUST NOW STARTING TO GET TO THE SCHOOLS AND SO IT. WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF. HOW THEY'RE USING THEM AND WHAT THEY'RE USING THEM FORM AND OTHER THAN THE ALLOW POLICE THAT'S- RIGHT THANK YOU MAYBE THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE TO HAVE GOING FORWARD. OUR NEXT QUESTION IS WITH REGARD INDEPENDENT STUDIES. RIGHT NOW INDEPENDENT STUDIES IS YOU KNOW IT. AS I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND IS THE WILD WEST YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH DO ANYTHING. AND PRETTY MUCH DO NOTHING THERE'S FOR EXAMPLE. IF A STUDENT IS INDEPENDENT STUDY THERE'S NO REQUIRED STUDENT TEACHER CONTACT TIME. K. IS A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN AND AN INDEPENDENT STUDY THEY DON'T SERVE- THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF A CHILD WE REALLY NEED TO CLEAN THAT UP I KNOW THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IS COMING OUT TODAY. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE GUYS WERE WALKING INTO THE ROOM MAYBE. SO MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT WHAT WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDED. TO IT TO PROPOSED WITH REGARD TO INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF CREDENTIALING. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION AGREE THAT TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CREDENTIALS. IF YOU COULD MAYBE SPEAK TO THE OVERALL- TOPIC OF INDEPENDENT STUDIES SUGGEST- TOOK- PROPOSED TRAILER LANGUAGE AND THE- THE APPROPRIATE- CREDENTIALING AND MAYBE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'RE DOING THERE BECAUSE AGAIN. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO AYE I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE STUDENTS ON INDEPENDENT STUDY THAN WE EVER HAVE NEXT YEAR. WE CAN LIKE IT OR NOT LIKE IT'S JUST A FACT THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR. SO THE FACT IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE STUDENTS THAT DO ON DO DO FALL UNDER THE INDEPENDENT STUDIES UMBRELLA. THERE IS- ACADEMIC ACCOUNTABILITY. ON THE ON THE THERE'S THAT KIND OF EARLY ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE AND THE FISCAL SIDE. SO COULD THE ADMINISTRATION. SPEAK TO THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE. CERTAINLY AND JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO YOU ARE CORRECT AS A MEMBER OF DONNELL AND THAT LANGUAGE WAS RELEASED LAST NIGHT SO MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS MORNING- THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY LANGUAGE- THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING AN OPTION FOR FAMILIES- IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. HOWEVER WANTED CABBIE OUT ALL OF THAT AND KIND OF PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT BY SAYING THAT WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THE DEFAULT IS IN PERSON FULL TIME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE FALL- ELLIE GAYS WILL ONLY HAVE THE SAME TWO OPTIONS FOR BURNING AND STATE APPORTIONMENT IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEY DID PRE PANDEMIC. AND THAT IS THE MUST OFFER ALL STUDENTS ACCESS TO A FULL TIME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION PROGRAM THEY CAN EARN A PORTION OF THAT WAY AND THEN THEY CAN CHOOSE TO OFFER INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM AND PARENTS CAN OPT INTO THAT PROGRAM IF THEY WISH. BUT ALL. THE IS CLEAR ALL THE- WILL BE OFFERED. ACTS TO A FULL TIME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION PROGRAM IN THE FALL. SO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY PIECE THAT IS THE OPTIONAL I'M PROGRAM THE LEDS CAN PROVIDE IN THAT PARENTS CAN OPT INTO. IS BUILT ON THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM WE HAD SOME STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT- THE QUALITY OF SOME OF THE INDEPENDENT THREE PROGRAMS THAT WERE BEING. CONDUCTED A MINISTER PRIOR TO COMMITTING DURING COVE IT- IN A LOT OF THEM HAVE TO DO I THINK WITH A SIMILAR CONCERN. THAT YOU ALL HAVE AROUND YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT UNDER THE OLD LAWS YOU KNOW AT AT. AN EARLY AGE COULD SEND A PACKET HOME WITH THE STUDENTS AND- YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS ACTUALLY IS TEACHING THEMSELVES AND THEN COMING BACK AND SWITCHING OUT PACKETS TWO WEEKS LATER YOUTHAT THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPORT OF A- SO ARE PER. AND IS. ON IT OF- IMPROVEMENTS TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM. THE FIRST EING THAT- FOR ANY STUDENT THAT IS PARTICIPATING OPTING INTO AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE DEVICE THAT TECH THAT TECHNOLOGY ESSENTIALLY DEVICE AND CONNECTIVITY. ON TO PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE INSTRUCTION- ANOTHER KEY PIECE IN TERMS OF THE STUDENT TEACHER ENGAGEMENT IS THAT THE- TEACHER WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO A DAILY CHECK INS WITH A STUDENT TODAY TO CHECK IN WITH THEM MAKE SURE THEY'RE OKAY SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY NEEDS OR CONCERNS. AND THEN AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK PROVIDES SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION WITH THAT STUDENT SO THE IDEA OF BEING HERE THAT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK THAT THAT THE TEACHER HAS TO PROVIDE A LESSON TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY STUDENTS. ON THE LISTING CHRIS MANNER- IN ADDITION WE HAVE SOME. AROUND RE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO- WE PUT TOGETHER SB NINETY EIGHT IN SB TWENTY AROUND TO AGREEING GAUGE AND STRATEGIES. ON BEING PUT IN PLACE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ENGAGED ON FOR THREE DAYS AT LEAST THREE DAYS- OR 60% OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. HERE STILL ENSURING THAT THOSE KIDS WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED WELL AND IN THE AN INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM HAVE- SOMEONE REACHING OUT TO THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN RE ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS. SO THAT'S SORT OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE PROPOSING- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HONOR. GREAT NOW THANK THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT WAS MUCH QUITE FRANKLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING IN THIS TIME. TO REALLY BOLSTER THAT PROGRAM ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER AUDITING. I WOULD IN A PERFECT WORLD I GRADUATE THE FUNDING OF A STUDENTS AT SCHOOL IS NOT IN A SCHOOL SETTING. THE SCHOOL- THAT THE ALLEGATION NOT GET FULL FUNDING FOR THAT STUDENT- UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW STEVE YOU'RE NOT NEVER THERE ARE ONLY ONLINE WHITE WHITE WHY WE SHOULD THEY RECEIVE FULL EIGHTY AGE MAYBE MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT. IS THAT OF BRICKS AND MORTAR AND ALL THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BRICKS AND MORTAR SHOULD BE A GRADUATED FUNDING- A STREAM. AND AGAIN% THE AUDITS ARE KEY AND BOLSTERING THE ACADEMIC SIDE I REALLY DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET- YEAH I THINK IT IT'S GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE CHILDREN- IT YET ENGAGING AN INDEPENDENT STUDY- NEXT YEAR BUT THAT'S- THE TOP. AT THE PART OF THE ONE OF THE TOP OF THE HEARING THIS HEARING BUT NOT THE ONLY TOPIC. BUT AGAIN- WITH REGARD TO- IT INDEPENDENT STUDY NOW WE HAVE AS COMPANIES COMING INTO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN OFFERING TO HANDLE THEIR ONLINE LEARNING FOR THEM. AND THAT- PRESENTS A COUPLE QUESTIONS AB FIVE ALONE. AB FIVE VIOLATIONS. SO I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION IS WILLING TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS. TO ENSURE THAT- I INDEPENDENT STUDY IS. IS BOLSTERED AND APPROPRIATE AND LEGAL- SO WHAT WE'LL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD- SO LET ME SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT QUESTION HERE US PROBABLY AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE RE BENCHING A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS THERE IS THERE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE YET ON THE RE BENCHING OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS IT A TREE BENCHING. AND WHAT WITH THE GUARANTEE BE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A REINVENTION AND THAT THOSE THAT DID REMAINS FUNDED IN THE OUT YEARS ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD A GRADE LEVEL THE PEOPLE LEADER STANDIFER ADDING T. K. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ADDING A GRADE LEVEL WE DON'T WANT TO JUST ADD A GRADE LEVEL TO AN EXISTING BUCKET OF DOLLARS WE WANT TO GROW THAT. BUCKET OF DOLLARS AS WE GROW THE STUDENTS THAT WERE ADDING INTO THAT POCKET SO AGAIN THE QUESTION IS WHAT IT WHAT ONE OF THEMECHANICS REINVENTION PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT IS THERE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE YET FOR THAT. OF COURSE. THE OTHER PERMANENT FINANCE AGAIN I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION ACTUALLY. I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT QUITE TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. THE INTENT WITH EVERY BATCH IT TO BE ABLE TO GROW THE POT OF FUNDING IN THE CASE UNDER OUT THE ATTACK WITH THE FEET WITH THIS INCREASE OF ADA. AND NOT JUST CROWD OUT FUNDING. FOR OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF INCREASED ABOUT THE ABOUT WITH HIM. PROBABLY NINETY EIGHT- IF WE IF WE DIDN'T TAKE THAT APPROACH SO. AT THE MOMENT. BECAUSE BE ADDITIONAL ADA NOT THAT TO. BE ROLE THEN UNTIL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. LPF PERCEIVED THE CONTINUOUS OF CORPORATION. OF THE APPROACH AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WE WOULD. OVER APPROPRIATE- THE GUARANTEED MOST LIKELY BY WHATEVER. AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ESTIMATE. WILL BE INTRODUCED ASSOCIATED WITH THAT INCREASE THEN CAN. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EIGHTY EIGHT. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- AND THEN ONE. FULL IMPLEMENTATION IS ACHIEVED AFTER THE NEXT THREE YEARS FROM THERE- WE WOULD LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT WOULD MAKE THE MOST SENSE WHETHER IT'S AN ONGOING TEST ONE PERCENTAGE REBOUNDS OR OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM ASSUMING WE- WOULD STILL BE AN ATTACHED ONE AT THAT TIME- WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT. DOWN BUT CURRENTLY UNDER THE- TRAILER BILL AS- DRAFTED THE MOMENT THERE IS NOT JUST A BIG LANGUAGE TO THAT EFFECT. RIGHT- THANK YOU I. WITH REGARD TO THE EXTENT OF THE HOW THOSE- DAHLE DIFFERENT THAN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. WE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR LEARNING LOS. CARLOS DOLLARS DIFFERENT WHAT EXTENDED LEARNING VERSUS LEARNING LOSSES OF THE SAME THING THAT MORE MONEY FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. PROBABLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. APARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION- WAS GEARED TOWARDS EXPANDING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH INCLUDED EXTENDING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME ACCELERATING PROGRESS TO CLOSE ANY GAPS AND INTEGRATED SUPPORTS- THERE MAY BE SOME OVERLAP WITH THE LEVEL USES RELATED TO TUTORING AND LEARNING RECOVERY PROGRAMS BUT A. B. B. SIX WAS OUT A LITTLE MORE BROAD TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARRANGING RENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT CLUBS- ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- THESE FARMS THE TWO POIT SIX BILLION WITH SUPPLEMENTAL FOUR POINT SIX BILLION INVESTMENT FOR- GEARING TOWARDS INTENSIVE. EACH MINUTE RESEARCH TESTED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS HIGH DOES TUTORING AND IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT LONGER TERM NEEDS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT TARGETED INTERVENTION AND RE ENGAGEMENT- FOCUSING ON STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS ENGLISH LEARNERS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAPPEN ON THIS FORTUNATELY IMPACTED. BY THE KIND OF. THANK YOU I THINK WE NEED TO. ECN THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND EVERY STUDENT HAS HAS NEEDS I MEAN THERE ARE STUDENTS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY GOTTEN- FOUR POINT NO THAT ARE NOW TO THREE POINT TWO. SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS TO IT CAN'T BE JUST AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL CREDIT RECOVERY IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE GPA RECOVERY SO I HELP OR THINKING- BROADLY ON THIS AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY STUDENTS WHO. WOULD HAVE DONE FINE BUT FOR THE PANDEMIC THAT NOW ARE NOT DOING SO FINE. AND THEIR GPAS HAVE DROPPED ARE NOT GOING TO GET ENOUGH CALLS THAT THEY POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE HAD THE PANDEMIC. NOT HIT BUT WE NEED TO THINK OF ALL STUDENTS. AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HURTING MORE THAN OTHERS BUT- BUT BUT BUT MANY ARE HURTING THAT WE MADE. THAT MIGHT NT HAVE BEEN HURTING YEAH- BUT FOR THE PANDEMICS ARE OVERWORKED FOR THINKING BROADLY ON IS. JUST ANOTHER A TOPIC A CT. I MEAN IT'S TRAGIC THAT THERE'S NO INCREASE IN CD FUNDING- THERE'S A GREAT DEMAND FOR THESE DOLLARS- THERE'S MORE DEMAND THAN DOLLARS AND THIS IS. ONE YEAR WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- ONE OTHER ISSUE IS WITH PERSON STIRS IS THERE AN INVESTMENT IN PERSON STIRS. IT THE ON THE MINIMUM IF YOU WILL- WHAT THE WHAT IS TYPICALLY PUT INTO YOUR PERSON STIRS AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT'S PROBABLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I HAS JUST GONE TO PARTNER FINANCE SO BE- THE EMPLOYER SHARE OF COST FOR SCHOOLS- PER PERSON SCARES IS STILL RECEIVING AND THE ONE TIME BENEFIT PROVIDED ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT PROVIDED RESOURCES TO PAY DOWN THE RATES IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN 202-020-2020 ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- BUT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS INTO PERSON SERVICE ON BEHALF. OF- SCHOOL EMPLOYERS. OKAY I THINK YOU ARE WE ARE STATE WHY ARE WE ARE WE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO PERSON SIR SO I PULLED I THOUGHT WE WERE. FOR UHHUH. I BELIEVE. GOD THIRTY. I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE HOW CAN TO FIND WITH THE GENTLEST OFFICE SO- WE'RE NOT MAKING ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS LIKE WE HAVE IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT BOTH THE STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE IN THE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTION RATE IS GOING UP. OVER TIME AND HAS BEEN GOING UP- SO THOSE ARE INCREASES LIKELY RELATED TO PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES WE JUST THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS- LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE THIS YEAR TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS AND GAIN SOME ADDITIONAL SAVINGS. OVER POTENTIALLY THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES. THANK YOU TO ME THE NEW BRAINER THE STATE WOULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SO. IN PERSON STIRS. AND JUST ONE LAST THING IS WITH REGARD TO PULLING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THE ADULTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS- A TO ME THAT'S JUST CRIMINAL MAYBE EVEN LITERALLY- AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO OPEN- THIS MONEY THE THAT THE- ADULTS. INTO THESE PRO OR INTO INTO BASICALLY PROP NINETY EIGHT PROGRAMS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IS ONLY GONNA GROW. SO THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO ADD JOB OUT- MONEY THAT WE USED TO EDUCATE. PRE K. THROUGH FOURTEEN STUDENTS AND I JUST THINK THAT'S RATHER UNFORTUNATE I GET THE POLITICS OF IT BUT I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE WITH THAT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. I THINK AS YOU NOTED THERE'S SOME HIGH LEVEL ISSUES THAT WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF OUR TIME ON BUT- THIS. PROPOSAL HAS QUITE A FEW NEW THINGS AND- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE TO- PASSER CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE BY THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE FOR THE BUDGET BUT- SOME OF THESE THINGS. YOU KNOW MAY WE MAY NOT AGREE ON RIGHT AWAY AND FIGURE OUT AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE REST THIS SUMMER AS WELL SO JUST. KEEP THAT AS WELL THE FOR NOT TOTALLY COMFORTABLE YOU CAN ALWAYS REVISIT SOME OF THESE PIECES- SOME MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. YEAH I JUST- RIGHT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE BROUGHT UP SEVERAL I THINK WE GET ISSUES THERE- TO BE THINKING ABOUT AGAIN I'M GONNA COME BACK TO. I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO BE PUTTING OUR FOCUS ON SHORING UP AND IMPROVING OUR EXISTING SYSTEM. AND NOT GETTING TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH A LOT OF NEW PROGRAMMING- AND I'LL SAY IT THIS WAY. ARE ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. HEY LET'S JUST FOCUS ON ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR SOME NEW. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS- IDEA. AND A COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION- AND I THINK IN ORDER TO DO THAT THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED AND- IN OUR- BUDGET ONE OF THAT I BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE SEVERAL TIMES I REALLY HOPE WE WORK ON IS A MINIMUM FUNDING FOR RURAL SCHOOLS. THAT SAID THERE IS A THERE'S VERY MUCH A MISSING MIDDLE AND RURAL SCHOOLS THEY GET THEY GET HAMPERED AFFECTED YOU KNOW DRASTICALLY BY LCF FORMULA WE TALKED ABOUT DOING IT EARLIER THIS YEAR AND EARLY ACTION. I THINK THE SENATE HAD A PROPOSAL FOR A MINIMUM I'M I REALLY HOPE HEY WE HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY LET'S LET'S TRY AND REMEDY THAT- SPECIAL EDUCATION YESTERDAY IN A CALL INCREASE THAT'S GREAT. BUT JUST LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR WAS SAYING HE HAD A THREE FOR A THREE YEAR PHASE IN MULTI YEAR PROCESS TO REALLY INVEST IN OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND THIS THIS PROPOSAL AS MAY REVISE DOESN'T GET US THERE IT'S BETWEEN WHEN YOU COMPARE WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DOING ITS A VERY MINIMAL. INVESTMENT CERTAINLY WE NEED TO GET SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT THAT'S BEEN A BIG FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BASED ON THIS THREE YEAR PROGRAM THAT WE WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT. DOING CT GETTING NO CALL INCREASE STILL IN THIS MERRY VISES JUST COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS WE KNOW THAT WE NEED THESE PROGRAMS WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT. THEY ARE LET'S SHOW THAT THEY'RE IMPORTANT. NOT BY GIVING ZERO. AND ANY OF HILL IT'S EVEN MORE CRAZY ABOUT THAT. IS THE CASE THROUGH TWELVE CT IS GETTING NO CALL INCREASE. BUT THE SORRY THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS GAINING A CALL INCREASE Y. IT MAKES NO SENSE AND WE HAVE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT MAYBE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE ANYWAY AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH IS TALKED ABOUT. BUT IF THESE ARE A PRIORITY THEN LET'S INVEST IN THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE SUSTAINABLE- CONTINUOUS AND EFFECTIVE FUNDING FOR THE C. T. PROGRAMS. FOSTER YOUTH A SIMILAR STORY- WE HAD THE L. A. O. DO A REPORT. THEY CAME OUT WITH IT- RECOMMEND IN THE NEAR TERM GOLD ALLOCATING FUNDS BASED ON A TWO TIER FOR MODEL. ONE FOR ALL FOSTER YOUTH IN A SECOND RATE FOR STUDENTS IN SHORT TERM- RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS- BUT YET IN THIS MAY REVISE THAT THE FUNDING FOR OUT OF HOME CARE PROGRAM THIS IS STILL CURRENTLY FROZEN- SO WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES THERE AND ENSURE THAT OUR FOSTER YOUTH. IN IN OUR EXISTING EDUCATION SYSTEMS- ARE BEING ADDRESSED SO I MEAN THOSE WOULD BE THE POINTS THAT I WOULD REALLY. FOCUS ON I THINK AS A COMMITTEE WE SHOULD- TRY REINFORCE IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY THANK YOU FOR. SO THE NUMBER OF I. S. THANK YOU- THERE HAVE BEEN MANY KEY POINTS BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY- I REALLY WANT TO TOUCH ON SPECIAL EDUCATION- THIS IS A- GROUP OF STUDENTS- IN K. THROUGH TWELVE- BUT- REALLY- K. THROUGH TWELVE BECAUSE WE DO SERVE TO KATE NOW- THAT. HAS HAD A REALLY TOUGH YEAR AND I KNOW ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE A TOUGH YEAR- BUT HAS IT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY STRENUOUS DOWN THE REGRESSION THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH SO MANY SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS- IS SOMETHING THAT- WE'RE GONNA BE. TRYING TO RECOVER FOR THE NEXT YOU KNOW DECADE PLUS. ON THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION INCREASE AND FEDERAL ID A- FUNDING AND A FOUR. POINT ZERO FIVE COLA. FOR ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ONE POINT FIVE COLA PROPOSED IN JANUARY. HOWEVER IT WAS JUST LAST YEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A THREE PHASE A MULTI YEAR PROCESS. TO IMPROVE SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SERVICES AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS YEAR'S PROPOSAL SEEMS LIKE A MINIMAL INVESTMENT AND DOESN'T MOVE THAT EFFORT FORWARD. THE MAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES MORE THAN A TWENTY MILLION IN STATE OPERATIONS SUPPORT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PRIMARILY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- OF FIFTEEN MILLION DISPUTE RESOLUTION THREE POINT THREE MILLION AND SIX NEW POSITIONS WERE COMPLIANT CASELOAD AND MONITORING NEARLY A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT. THESE PROPOSALS SUGGEST AN EMPHASIS ON IEP COMPLIANCE AND MEETING THE LETTER OF THE LAW RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON MAXIMISING RESOURCES. TO SERVE STUDENTS SO MY QUESTION IS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WERE STRUGGLING BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC AND THE SCHOOL CLOSURES HAVE HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON ASK AT RISK STUDENTS. WHY DOESN'T THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE A BIGGER AND TARGETED INVESTMENT DESERVES SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT EVEN POSSIBLY INCREASING INCREASING THAT THAT THE BASED ON FOR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS- I REITERATE THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU PARTY OUTLINED- THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION AND WE DO CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE MAY REVISION- PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES NOT ONLY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS WITH YOU HIGHLIGHTED. BUT ALSO AND I'M AND I'M A NUMBER OF OTHER INVESTMENTS- THAT HAVE BEEN GOING OUT BOTH STATE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTMENTS- AROUND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION- AND TARGETED INTERVENTION GRANTS WHICH ARE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND ALSO SPECIFICALLY CALL OUT AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AS ONE OF THE- GROUPS TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR. I'M IN IN IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE- THAT MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT WAS LAID OUT LAST YEAR WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- AS PART OF THAT PLAN LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR IN THE BUDGET DID IT DIDN'T BEST AND SEVERAL WORK pPROCESS AROUND AND SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING REFORM IN PROGRAMMATIC REFORM THAT IS NEEDED AND THOSE WORKERS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING SEVERAL OF THOSE WORKERS HAVE REPORTS THAT BE. USED TO THE LEGISLATURE INTO. OCTOBER OF NEXT YEAR AND WE DO INTEND TO- WORKING TO REVIEW THOSE FINDINGS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE IN TERMS OF REFORMS THAT ARE NEEDED GOING FORWARD- WE'RE VERY MINDFUL AND INTENTIONAL- AROUND NOT GETTING OUT- IN FRONT OF THOSE EFFORTS AND WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH OUR PARTNERS ON FUNDING REFORMS THAT ARE NEEDED- WITH REGARDS TO THE OUT OF HOME CARE FUNDING- I BELIEVE THERE. THERE WAS ATTENTION CALL TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE AND I'M FREEZING THAT FUNDING FOR AN ADDITIONAL WEEK THERE THAT'S ALSO IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THE ONLY- RECENTLY CONVENED IN OUT OF HOME CARE FUNDING WORK GROUP- AND- PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE MAYOR VISION THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR FINANCE AND OF THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE L. A. O. TO GET TOGETHER TO CAN TO- DECIDE ON WHAT THE BEST BEST PATH FOR. WAS COMING OUT OF THAT WORK FOR. AND AGAIN WE WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THAT. RECOGNIZING THAT THERE HAS A GREAT DEAL CLASS. AROUND ACTUALLY OR- ACT THIS POINT. AND ONE YOU TO. WE WOULD. AN UPDATE ON THE EUROPE EFFORT. AGAIN I THINK THE REPORTS FROM THE WORK THAT ARE COMING OUT IN OCTOBER OF THIS NEXT YEAR WILL GUIDE A LOT OF FACT EFFORT- WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THE THAT THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE THOSE REPORTS AND- BE FORMED LARGELY BY THOSE WORKERS CONVERSATION THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING. GREAT YOU. YEAH YEAH MORE OKAY. OKAY THANK YOU SO MEMBER TEAM. THANK YOU FOR OUR FIRST LET ME JUST- THANK ARCHIE FOR ALL HIS. ON THE LEADERSHIP ON THE T. K. ISSUE I THINK THIS IS A- GREAT- AND HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO. FINALLY ARE CORRECT I THINK WHAT'S BEEN A FAIRLY LARGE AND JUSTICE 275% OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE STATE THAT. WE HAVE 25% OF OUR CHILDREN ARE GETTING AN EXTRA YEAR OF EDUCATION 75% NOT GETTING AND I THINK THIS IS A- HUGE STEP IN REALLY CORRECTING THAT AND I. JUST WANT TO COMMEND OUR OUR CHAIR FOR ALL OF HIS HIS GREAT LEADERSHIP ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AS WELL AS- I THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING IT IN HIS. MAY REVISE I DID WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME LIGHT ON COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS- FROM LONG BEACH- PERHAPS MISS HOME COULD COME BACK ON. AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE REAL OPENING DOLLARS I MEAN IF AB EIGHTY SIX- GOT SCHOOLS- FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP THEM RE OPEN AS AN INCENTIVE- TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING- FEDERAL AID- TO HELP WITH. LEARNING RECOVERY- IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT ON TOP OF THAT POTENTIAL SIXTEEN. BILLION DOLLARS PLUS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES ARE COMING OUT WHY THEY WOULD NEED SOME MORE MONEY- TO BE OPEN ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR COVERT RATES ARE- AT AS LOW A RATE AS A WORST MARCH OF LAST OF LAST YEAR- THE CDC- HOUSE HAS GONE TO A THREE FOOT INSTEAD OF A SIX FOOT DISTANCE AND- I ANTICIPATE BY THE FALL YOU KNOW KNOCK ON WOOD. THAT WE WILL BE PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. WHAT YOUR HEARING FROM DISTRICTS THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY. NEED TO SPEND THIS MONEY ON. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM AND DISCOMS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO JUST IN TERMS OF ALL CANCER BOTH THOSE QUESTIONS- IN TWO PARTS THE FIRST PART IS REGARDING THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO ELEAZAR. WHO HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR SO AS YOU AS YOU WELL KNOW AB EIGHTY SIX- PROVIDED SIX POINT SIX BILLION OF WHICH TWO BILLION WAS AVAILABLE FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS TO HELP ADDRESS HEALTH AND SAFETY AND NEED THE VALLEY IT'S AN OPENING. OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE FUNDS WERE ALSO AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYWHERE REMAINING ON IN THE BUDGET YEARS FILED. AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT SIX BILLION WAS ON PROPOSED FOR EXPANDING AN INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. AS WELL AS PROVIDING ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS SO IN TERMS OF THE TWO BILLION. THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS BUDGET- THAT'S IT'S A LITTLE MORE CLOSE ALIGN WITH THE- BILLION CORRECT THAT WAS BY. THROUGH AB EIGHTY SIX AS OPPOSED TO THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR EXPANDING LEARNING TIME. ON ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS. SO THAT FUNDING THE TWO BILLION AB EIGHTY SIX AGAIN WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- AND THEN AGAIN AT CAN CARRY OVER INTO THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL. AND THAT WAS REALLY INTENDED TO HELP COVER THE COSTS OF OPENING IN THE CURRENT YAR- GIVEN THAT THE YOU KNOW I'VE AS YOU RECALL YOU KNOW PRIOR TO YOU WHERE WE ARE NOW. AND THAT THE MUCH MORE STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON THINGS LIKE TESTING- AND CLEANING STANDARDS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING- THIS TO BUILD. ISRAELI FOLK ON THE BUDGET YEAR. AND IN TERMS OF. AND PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ALL LEDS SO- YOU ALSO REFERRED TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE GONE OUT ON A FEDERAL FUNDS AND THOSE ARE REALLY GOING FOCUSED ON TITLE ONE. DOESN'T ALLOCATED BASED ON TITLE ONE ENROLLMENT- SO THAT THE MAJORITY OF FUNDS HAVE GONE TO CERTAIN ALLEYS AND NOT OTHERS- AND THE TWO BILLION THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WOULD BE SPREAD OUT MORE. EVENLY ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL LEDS- ADDITION- IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR THESE FUNDS IN THE BUDGET YEAR- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE- THEY'RE GONNA BE REQUIREMENTS RUN HEALTH AND SAFETY AND SIMPLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT FOR MANY CHILDREN. ON THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A VACCINE AVAILABLE- AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THIS WILL CREATE SOME CONCERN AMONG MANY PARENTS ON WHETHER OR NOT TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN BACK FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDING- THE KINDS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY- PROTOCOLS AND THAT HELP PARENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. IN ADDITION- THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE WILL BE A VACCINE- FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AS WE MOVE THROUGH YOU KNOW HE COMING YEAR AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ELEAZAR WANT TO FIND- TAXATION CLINICS OR AND CONTINUE TO DO TESTING UP UP UP UP UNTIL THAT POINT. ON THE SONS OF THE ALLOWABLE THE BIT THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE USE FOR THESE FUNDS AS WELL SO THEY'RE INTENDED TO BUILD UPON THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED THEIR INTENDED TO COVER THE NEEDS OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEY'RE INTENDED TO BE PROVIDED TO A BROADER. SWATH. OF ALLEYS ACROSS THE STATE. DO YOU HAVE FROM REGARD THE TO MORE THAT WAS A PER. BUT THEY BE AT LEAST DO YOU- KNOW HOW. OF A HAS BEEN. AND ON WHAT. SO THOSE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO COVER COSTS THE LEDS INCURRED- PRIOR TO THIS WE CAN AS LONG AS HOLDEN I'M NOT ASKING WHAT THE ALLOWABLE USES FOR NOT NOT FOR THE TWO BILLION IN YOUR MAYBE VICE PULLS OF THE TWO BILLION THAT WE ALREADY APPROPRIATED THREE B. EIGHTY SIX. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS BEEN. SPENT AND ON WHAT. SO THE FIRST ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS WAS- I BELIEVE IT HAS JUST BEEN MADE THE FIRST ALLOCATION WITH INTENDED TO GO OUT IN MAY. OF THIS YEAR AND THE WITH THE FOLLOW UP TO GO OUT IN AUGUST BECAUSE THAT WAS DEPENDENT UPON SCHOOLS RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. SO WE DON'T HAVE DATA YET ON WHAT THOSE EXPENDITURES WERE. HOWEVER WE DID PROVIDE ELEAZAR WITH THEIR- TOTAL GRANT AWARD AMOUNT. AND DID TELL THEM THAT THEY COULD USE THOSE FUNDS. TO REIMBURSE THEMSELVES FOR COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THOSE PLANS. SO WE WILL KNOW- AFTER THAT THOSE FUNDS WILL GO OUT HOW THEY WERE EXPENDED BUT IT MAY BE THAT THEY'RE ALREADY IDENTIFIED- INTACT. FOR EXPENDITURES THAT HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED. GOT IT WILL ALSO. HOME WHAT WHAT WE DIDN'T DISCUSS WITH THE FIVE BILLION THAT WAS ALREADY APPROPRIATED PREVIOUSLY. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR RE OPENING- THE MAJORITY OF IT WAS USED FOR DISTANCE LEARNING SO THAT. ELLIE IS HAD THAT CHOICE FOR THE FIVE BILLION. TO SPEND IT AND I WAS THE LEGISLATURE THAT WITHOUR INSTRUCTION THE GOVERNOR'S DESTRUCTION LEGISLATURE DESTRUCTION TO. SPEND IT ON- THE OPENING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT- SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T DO VERY WELL SO I GUESS- FOR ME I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM BEACH OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING OUT AND MAY. END IN AUGUST AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW. IF THEY HAVE SPENT IT OR EVEN NEEDED IT SEEMS- PREMATURE. TO DO ANOTHER TWO BILLION ON TOP OF THAT. WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT THEY EVEN NEED THE TWO BILLION ESPECIALLY. WILL BE GIVEN THE FIVE BILLION FOR RE OPENING WHICH WE HAD HOPED WOULD BE USED FOR MASS AND PLEXIGLASS AND SPACING- ONLY 10% OF IT WAS USED FOR THOSE TYPES OF ITEMS AND SO I THINK. THAT- TO ME THE TWO BILLION COULD BETTER BETTER USED ELSEWHERE. I WANTED TO GO INTO. ON JUST JUST OF WHAT WHAT ALSO JUST GOING TO INDEPENDENT STUDY AS WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE QUESTION IS THERE A REASON WHY WE DON'T WANT THE GUY- THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROPOSE A CAP ON. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS USING INDEPENDENT STUDY. YES SO- WE DIDN'T PROPOSED A CAP UNDERSTANDING THAT IN SYDNEY TO THE EXTENT THE PARENTS FROM WOULD LIKE THE CHOICE TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN BE IN DISTANCE LEARNING AGAIN NEXT YEAR. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION NOT BE LIMITED AND BYE BYE A NUMBER AN ARBITRARY PERSON AT THE STATELEVEL. SO IF A SCHOOL WANTED TO ENROLL INDEPENDENT SAY THAT WOULD BE OKAY. W. ALLOWABLE I'M EIGHT I WANNA- JUST. MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION CLEARLY SO- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PARENT CHOICE AND A SCHOOL I HAVE. A REFER THAT QUESTION SO IF 90% OF PARENTS IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL WANTED TO ENROLL IN DISTANCE LEARNING THEIR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO AN END INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THAT'S CORRECT AND BACK END THE ADMINISTRATION BE OKAY WITHOUT. YES WE ARE SUPPORTIVE PARENT CHOICE AND IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR AND WHETHER OR NOT PARENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE BRINGING THEIR KIDS BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THIS IS A CELL I AM NOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE ON- PRETTY CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE- THAT. KNOWING HOW MUCH LEARNING LOSS WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR- KNOWING THAT AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT. NEEDING CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. FOR THIS INDEPENDENT STUDY- WITHOUT FURTHER TIGHTENING THIS I THINK IT WOULD BE ON. IT WOULD NOT BE VERY GOOD POLICY GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED AYE I KNOW THAT THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE DEBATED DISTANCE LEARNING AND I THINK GIVEN WHAT WE KNEW LAST YEAR TO GET WILL BE NEW LAST YEAR AS WE WERE IN. IN A MONTH TO OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT AND WE HAD HOPED THAT GIVING FROM DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DISTANCE LEARN BUT ALSO TO BRING THE CHILDREN BACK WOULD WOULD WORK. CLEARLY IT DID NOT I DISTRICTS- DEMONSTRATED A VERY- INABILITY TO SHUT DOWN BUT THEY DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY ALMOST NO ABILITY. TO OVER FULLY BACK IN SCHOOL EVEN AT A TIME WHEN A COVERT RATES AGAIN R. AS LAW WAS WHEN WE SHUT DOWN IN MARCH. ALSO IN TERMS OF INDEPENDENT STUDY I THINK IT'S VERY CONCERNING THAT THERE IS NOT DALY AND ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING WITH A CREDENTIAL TEACHER I THINK THAT- NOT HAVING- ANY PARTICULAR LANGUAGE ASTO- WHAT WILL HAPPEN-HILL CAN THAT PARTICULAR SETTING I THINK- WE DON'T DEFINE THAT IN GREATER DETAIL I THINK WE WILL DEFINITELY. LIVE TO REGRET THIS NEXT YEAR HEN WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING GOING INTO NEXT YEAR'S ME REVISED. I'M JUST IN ADDITION I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT- WE HAD HOPED- THAT DISTRICTS WOULD FOLLOW OUR INSTRUCTION TO HAVE IN PERSON LEARNING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE- ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO DO THAT I THINK- MY OWN. DISTRICT HAS BECOME THE POSTER CHILD OF HOW NOT TO DO THIS. ON AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A TRIGGER ON HOW TO RE OPEN IF IN FACT WE DO HAVE SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE AN OUTBREAK. OF BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK DISTRICTS WILL PROBABLY THE BE ALLOWED TO SHUT DOWN A WILL NEED TO SHUT DOWN. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT TYPE O TRIGGER WILL BRING THEM BACK HI I FEAR THAT ONCE DISTRICTS ARE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF AN OUTBREAK THAT THEY WILL NOT COME BACK AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS- JUST I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR A COMMENT. ABOUT HAVING A TRIP. OR WHAT- WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO BRING DISTRICTS BACK SHOULD THERE BE. AN OUTBREAK OF ONCE THEY OPEN UP OPEN BACK UP IN THE FALL. CERTAINLY AND JUST TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFYING AND CONTEXT TO YOUR INITIAL REMARKS- WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO OFFER LEAST THE OPTION. OF EITHER AN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OR DISTANCE LEARNING. WE ARE PROPOSING THAT IN THE FALL I LIAISE WILL BE REQUIRED AS A DEFAULT TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FULL TIME TO EVERY SINGLE STUDENT- WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS SIMPLY THAT WE ALLOW THE INDEPENDENT STUDY MODEL- THAT EXISTED BEFORE KOBE TO CONTINUE TO EXIST. POST CODE ED BUT WITH IMPROVEMENTS AROUND QUALITY AND WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT I'M CREDENTIALED TEACHERS BE ABLE O TEACH THESE PROGRAMS- THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE CREDENTIALS IN ORDER TO TEACH AN INDEPENDENT STUDY- AND WE ARE REQUIRING OUR LANGUAGE THAT JUST WAS RELEASED THIS MORNING DOES REQUIRE. I'M DAILY INTERACTION AND AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK OF SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION BETWEEN ON TEACHERS AND STUDENTS- INDEPENDENT STUDY SO JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT CONTACTS. INSURANCE AS THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAD AROUND PROVIDING A TRIGGER. FOR VALUES THAT MAY EXPERIENCE OUTBREAKS AND HAVING. A PLAN IN PLACE FOR THEM TO COME BACK WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF SHOULD TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT CONCEPT. I'M INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE. TOWARDS THE CLOSING OUT THE BUDGET. THANK I BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THE- ARE COMMENTS REGARDING RE OPENING IN THE PAUL HAVE BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR AND I REALLY DO COMMEND HIM. ON HIS ADVOCACY HIS VERY VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE AND I APPRECIATE YOU FOR REITERATING THAT SO- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I MYSELF COMPLETELY AGREE- THAT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOR ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LISTENING AND FOR ALL THE ASSOCIATIONS LISTING I THINK EVERY DISTRICT NEEDS TO BE PREPARED TO RETURN TO NORMAL. IN THE FALL BE BACK AT SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK IN PERSON I THINK WHAT'S VERY CRITICAL IS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR AFTER SCHOOL BECAUSE I BECAUSE- THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT FAMILIES NOT GOING BACK I THINK A NUMBER OF FAMILIES. ARE GOING BACK BECAUSE THERE'S NO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN'T. IF YOU KNOW IF YOUR WORKING FAMILY YOU CAN'T PICK UP YOUR CHILD AT ONE THIRTY UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY OR SOME OTHER. CARE GIVING OPTIONS SO HAVING. SCHOOL OPEN IN THE FALL IS NOT ENOUGH IT'S HAVING SCHOOL AND- BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL OPEN UP WITH THAT SO WE GO BACK TO THAT MODEL. IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT INVESTMENT IN THAT PROGRAM IN THIS BUDGET I DO REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT. I'M LET ME JUST LEAVE IT INDEPENDENT STUDY I UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS HOMES ARE I WORRY THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY WILL BE ABUSED THE WAY DISTANCE LEARNING HAS BEEN ABUSED. AND IF WE DON'T CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE WE WILL REGRET. SELL I UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO PASS A BUDGET ON JUNE FIFTEENTH WITH NOT WHICH NOT ONLY ARE REFLECTS THIS ERA OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAYING. BUT THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW REFLECTS BUT THE GOVERNOR HE SAID. AND IF WE REALLY WANT CHILDREN TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL. IN THE FALL THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY LOOPHOLE HOUSE TO BE CLOSED. IT HAS TO BE CLOSED IN A WAY TO MAKE A LEGITIMATE HAS TO BE CLOSED IN A WAY THAT WE ARE FULLY CONFIDENT THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO IS PURSUING THAT PATH IS GOING TO GET AS GOOD AN EDUCATION AS THOSE WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOM. SO I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING FOR AND I THINK THAT- WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- NOT JUST A GOAL IN SPIRIT. BUT THEIR GOAL IN LIFE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. SOME OF OUR BY THAT S. AND TWO QUICK ONE QUICK COMMENTS AND THEN- ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION- I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY AND- THEY HAD ONE OF MY SUPERINTENDENCIA WE ACTUALLY DON'T NEED MORE MONEY I'M BUT WHAT THEY NEED IS FLEXIBILITY IN ORDER TO SPEND AND MOVE AROUND CURRENT DOLLARS THAT THEY DO HAVE SO I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY BE CONSIDERING. AN OLD EIGHT GIVING THEM NOT FLEXIBILITY AND IS IT AN AND JULIE IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM AN ADDITIONAL TWO BILLION DOLLARS MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE P. TO DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT EACH COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN NEEDS THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALLOW THEM TO DETERMINE WHERE THESE FUNDS GO THAT ARE GONNA BE MOST BENEFICIAL TO STUDENTS ON. SECOND VACATION AMBLE FOR OF ALL I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. AND T. K. I KNOW OUR CHAMPION HERE OUR CHAIRMAN MCCARTY- HAS BEEN- REALLY AN ADVOCATE FOR EXPANDING T. K. FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS AND- HAPPY TO BE AN AUTHOR ON ON THE BILL- THAT IS NOW. IN THE SENATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH- ON ONE OF MY CONCERNS- IS WORK WITH THIS DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN AND T. K. AND KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. SO I JUST WANTED CLARIFICATION. ON WHEN. BECAUSE WE ARE BECAUSE THE- DEPARTMENT MINISTRATION. IT THE IS PROPOSES TO REPURPOSE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN JANUARY BUDGET- UTK INCENTIVE FUNDING TO AN ALLOCATION TO ALL ELEAZAR BASED ON KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT WHAT YEAR KINDERGARTEN OPEN ROMAN ARE WE USING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUR NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE OFF- I AM SO UPSET BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE START. ON THIS NEW PHASE STRONG SO AND IS ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND TALK TO THAT. A LITTLE BIT. CERTAINLY I WE ARE PROPOSING THAT AN ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. THAT THE KINDERGARTEN ENROLLMENT NUMBERS FROM NINETEEN TWENTY ARGUES- UNDERSTANDING THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAD QUITE AND PRODUCTION AND THE NUMBER OF KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS. ON EDUCATE STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOL- AND SO KNOWING THAT THOSE NUMBERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THAT HAVE BEEN NORMAL HERE. AND WE ARE PROPOSING TO USE THE. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE- EIGHTY EIGHT. GREAT AND WHAT'S- I AM GETTING YOU KNOW SOME QUESTIONS FROM SOME CONCERNED PROVIDERS- THAT CURRENTLY PROVIDE A PRESCHOOL FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS- BECAUSE WE HAVE WE DO HAVE A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. THAT RELIES ON PRIVATE NONPROFIT- WHAT. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING THEM OUT AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING- BUT I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THIS ROLLOUT GOES AS SMOOTHLY AS POSSIBLE. AND NOT OUR PROVIDERS KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING THEM BEHIND BOND THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL SEE AND- AND EXPANSION AND WE KNOW WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND- SLOTS- PROPOSED ON THAT MORE THREE YEAR OLDS WILL WILL BE SERVED- EIGHT. I'M AB I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE CAN SPEAK TO THE ON THE PANEL- COOPER PERFECT FOR MIXED DELIVERY PROVIDERS. CERTAINLY SO WE DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS CONCERN IN THE EARLY EDUCATION COMMUNITY AROUND THE MOVEMENT THE POTENTIAL MOVEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER FOUR YEAR OLDS AND TO THE T. CASE SYSTEM- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. SYDNEY AND PARENTS STILL SHOULD HAVE A CHOICE AND SO WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO DISALLOW FOUR YEAR OLDS FROM PARTICIPATING- IN A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IF THAT'S THEIR PARENTS CHOICE- BUT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT WAYS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING A PROPOSAL THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET ACT TO THIS EFFECT. WE ANTICIPATE TAKING THE FUNDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALLOCATE DISTINCT PRESCHOOL AND THINKING THROUGH THAT PROGRAM AGAIN TO MAKE IT MORE APPROPRIATE TO SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN- RECOGNIZING THAT WILL NEED TO DO SOME THINKING AROUND THE RATES- GIVEN THAT RATIOS CAN BE- MORE RESTRICTIVE FOR SERVING INTERNATIONAL TREND. BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THREE YEAR OLDS TO ALSO HAVE. ADDITIONAL YEAR OF. EDUCATION AND PLAY BASED NO DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE AND ACCESS TO LOOK AT CARE- PRIOR TO ENTERING TKA AS IT IS FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS TO HAVE A YEAR AS OF CARE QUALITY INSTRUCTION PRIOR TO ENTERING KINDERGARTEN SO THAT IS THE IDEAS THAT. ARE MOVING FORWARD WILL WILL RETHINK THE FUNDING AND THE PROGRAMS FOR STATE PRESCHOOL TO HELP THOSE PROVIDERS- SERVE YOUNGER CHILDREN INTERCEDING ON REIMBURSEMENT. APPROPRIATE TO THAT SERVICE. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AYE AYE I WANNA TALK ABOUT THEM I KNOW THIS AGENDA ITEM IS ALL ENCOMPASSING WE COULD HAVE HAD FIFTY CHEN ITEMS BUT IT'S THAT'S JUST A PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE SO I DO HAVE SOME- ISSUES AND QUESTIONS ON ON SCHOOLS AND T. K. BUT ALL THE ALL THE START RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT OFF ON T. K. THIS IS A BIG TOPIC WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC IN A LITTLE BIT- CERTAINLY I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT HE WOULD PUT HERE THAT I'M ALL IN ON THIS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BURKE. FOR MANY YEARS HAS BEEN- COUNTLESS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS AND TRIED TO MAKE UNIVERSAL PRE K. REALITY IN CALIFORNIA AND I HAVE A LIST OF THEM SO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE THEM BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE WORKED ON THIS OVER THE YEARS- BUT I GUESS THE BIG PICTURE I WANT TO SAY IS THAT AND IN ADDITION TO BEING ALL IN ON THIS A MAKING A REALITY THAT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT CHANGE IS HARD. AND THAT SOMETIMES- AB SAYING THE ORDER OF THINGS YEAH- CHANGERS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ON THAT ON THE POSITIVENESS OF THE IT AND FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FOR THE CHANGE RIGHT AWAY THERE IS 100% CERTAINTY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DETRIMENTAL AND SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN- WE WANTED TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND NOT ONLY KIDS AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIANS BUT PROVIDERS AND WE TRULY THINK AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES SAID AT HALF HOUR AGO THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR A WIN WIN WIN WITH OUR EXISTING- MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND JUST WHAT THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST NOTED THAT NOT PART OF THIS BUDGET NOT PARDEE EXPANSION% SLOTS THAT A NO NO NO WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THEIR PROVIDERS OUT THERE WHETHER THEY'RE CBO'S OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR WHAT HAVE YOU FAMILY FAMILY- CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THAT CURRENTLY SERVE FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE THE OPPORTUNISTS ARE MORE ZERO THREE THREE YEAR OLDS- WE EITHER A MASSIVE. WAITING LISTS WE HISTORICALLY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN UP LOTS. FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND I HE- SOME PROVIDERS SAY WELL THE MATH DOESN'T. WORK DOESN'T PENCIL OUT WELL I'M HERE TO STATE THAT WITH MY- INSULTS MY IPAD PENCIL RIGHT HERE BUT- WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT PENCIL OUT WHO WORK WITH US IN THIS BUDGET. IN AB TWENTY TWO. IN SB FIFTY CENT EARLY AMOUNTS BILL AND AS FINANCE SAID IN THE NEXT YEAR TO MAKE SURE IT PENCILS OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PROVIDERS OUT THERE ARE WHOLE. NO ONE LOSES THEIR JOB NO ONE LOSES THEIR BUSINESS FRANKLY WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE ECG WORKERS. WITH THE EXPANSION NOT LAST SO I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. BUT EVEN MORE MORE A TRANSFORMATIONAL THE FACT THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SEE SERVE MARKETS. IF YOU'RE A LOWER LOW INCOME FAMILY AND- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA RURAL CALIFORNIA SOME URBAN AREAS. ANOMALY BUT HAD A UNIVERSAL FOR FOUR YEAR OLD ACCESS BUT THREE YEAR OLD ACCESS YOU JUST THINK ABOUT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT'LL MAKE FOR KINDERGARTEN READINESS AS THE GOVERNOR SPOKE LAST WEEK IN THE MAY REVISE ITS NOT. AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IT'S REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND SO IF SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES LIVE TWO YEARS OF HIGH QUALITY YOU SEE BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN- THAT WILLIE WILL BE TRANSFORMATIONAL AND- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO NEED TO FOCUS ON. THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES THAT'S WHY WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE EXTENDING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS EXTENDING RAP. PROGRAMS AT TEEKAY SITES- IF FAMILIES WANTED TO HAVE THE- THE HALF DAY PROGRAM- IN AND WE ARE SAYING THAT T. K. AND K. WE DON'T WANT PART DATE WE WANT FULL DAY. K. PROGRAM SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT AS WELL- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE APPROPRIATE- QUALITY ELEMENTS TO MAKE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT. HAVING ONE ADULTS HAND TWENTY SOMETHING KIDS THIS IS A DISASTER FOR EVERYBODY SO- THE GOVERNOR HASN'T. PLAN EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE THE NEST. HAVING ONE ADULT FOR IT FOR TEN KIDS IN THE T. K. AND CAN OUR CLASSROOMS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS SO. WE REALLY ARE MINDFUL OF THIS- OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE THIS WORK. AS WELL THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT SO WE HAVE MULTIPLE YEARS TO PHASES SENT TO WORK ON THE WORK FORCE WORKING FACILITIES. BUT ALSO ALLOW OUR PROVIDERS AND CENTERS OUT THERE. TO WORK WITH US AND THEN I LAST THE AS I SAID IN THE LAST PANEL. NONE OF THIS WORKS UNLESS WE HAVE ADEQUATE- REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN A FEE STRUCTURE. TO PAY THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT CANCEL OUT SO- WERE 100% COMMITTED TO THAT- DID JUST AGAIN YOU KNOW- WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR PROVIDERS AND CHILD CARE FIELD ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN CAN BE A WIN WIN WIN FOR ALL OF US. AND SO- WITH THAT- I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER STATE ON ON THAT ISSUE I WILL SAY ON THE OVERALL PROBABLY INDIAN SCHOOL AT 100% CONCUR WITH BUT- OUR EDUCATION CHAIR MISTER O'DONNELL. TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET SHARES RETAIN. OUR SCHOOLS ARE RETURNING THIS THIS FALL NO DOUBT ABOUT IT QUIT ASKING ABOUT IF AND WHAT AND WHEN PER COMING BACK. UNLESS THERE'S SOME NEW VARIANTS ARE CRAZY SOMETHING HAPPENS DIFFERENT AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL ADAPT ADAPT TO THAT- I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD. TIGHTEN UP THESE INDEPENDENT STUDY IN A VIRTUAL ACADEMY TYPE THINGS BUT THEY'RE HAPPENING ANYWAY THESE ARE OF THIS IS BIG ARTICLE IN OUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER HERE TWO WEEKS AGO. BUT THESE ARE HAPPENING BEFORE. THE PANDEMICS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN DO THESE ANYWAY SO I DON'T SEE THERE AND THE NEED. TO DO SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT WE HAVE THE EXISTING STRUCTURE TO DO THIS CURRENTLY. AND IF WE NEED TO ADJUST THAT. WE CERTAINLY. CAN AND- I WILL. I'LL STOP THEIR EXYNOS GETTING LAID THE CAUCUS TIME WE HAVE ONE MORE ITEM AND PUBLIC COMMENT SO- TODAY THAT SAYS THAT'S ALL FOR THIS ITEM UNICOM'S MYSTERY OKAY THANK YOU WILL GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE SO FAR IS TRANSFORMING SCHOOLS AN EDUCATOR PIPELINE OVERVIEW SOUTH LAST APARTMENT OF FINANCE IN L.

I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE ANY MORE DETAIL ON THESE INVESTMENTS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. NEXT. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS MICHAEL PEREZ WITH THE ILLEGAL I WILL PROVIDING OUR BRIEF COMMENT THE PROPOSAL ARE GETTING HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT MY COLLEAGUE AMY WE WILL PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS ON EDUCATOR TYPE AND PROPOSALS. ALTHOUGH TO INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION GRANT TO PRODUCE LITTLE TO STUDENT RATIOS. THE PROPOSAL IS REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF BOTH EFFECTIVE. AT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DISTRICTS WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH IN ENGLISH LEARNERS. HELPCENTER DISTRICTS CAN INCREASE OR IMPROVE SERVICES. THAT SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING AND WELL BEING. THE PROPOSAL ALSO GIVES THE CREDIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW TO. ADDRESS VESTED THROUGH NEEDS- NEXT FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING GRANT PROPOSAL WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE COULD SHOULD CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS OF RESTRICTING THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR EXPANDED LEARNING. ACCESS TO SUMMER AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGING ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL DAY AND PROVIDE ADULT SUPERVISION FOR CHILDREN WITH PARENTS WORKING TRADITIONAL HOURS. ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING TO ROUGHLY A FIFTH BUT GIVING DISTRICTS LOOKS ABILITY TO SPEND FUNDS ACTIVITIES THAT THEY THINK WILL BEST INTERESTED STUDENTS AND YOUTH WHICH COULD INCLUDE SUMMER AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO TARGET FUNDING TO OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. SUCH AS A THING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR PROVIDING INTENSIVE TUTORING OR OTHERS TO SUPPORT. OUR LAST WEEK PER THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL CARE PROPOSAL WE THINK THE CHANGES MADE TO IMPROVE ON THE JANUARY PROPOSAL. WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE MODIFICATIONS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PARTICULARLY THE CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM THAT ENSURES FUNDING IS PRIORITIZE FOR CREATING NEW PROGRAMS. OF THE LANGUAGE AROUND- PROVIDING MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS EVEN SETTING UP A REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER. AND BE A MUCH MORE OF A CLEAR EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE SET FOR THE SUPPORT THAT SCHOOL WHO RECEIVE- THE MEMBER VISION PROPOSED THE- INCREASE AND FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER PROVIDING SMALLER AMOUNT OF FUNDING INITIALLY BY ADDING FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS THAT THE MANDATE HIGH- THAT CONCLUDES MY PORTION OF OUR REMARKS FINISHED WITH THREE ON NOT PASSED ON TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS A NEARLY WHAT THE ALEJO. I WILL BE COVERING THE EDUCATOR SUPPORT IN PIPELINE PROPOSALS- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT FOR REFERENCE THESE COMMENTS CAN BE FOUND ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE ALLEY OVER YOU CAN'T OUT. SO WE HAVE THREE OVERARCHING POINTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. FIRST WE THINK THAT THE CAPACITY FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED IMMEDIATELY POST PANDEMIC. SO THE ME REVISED PROPOSES NUMEROUS NEW AND EXPANDED EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INITIATIVES WHICH REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT. GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF BURNOUT AND FATIGUE AMONGST MANY SCHOOL STAFF SCHOOLS MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OR TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THESE INITIATIVES IMMEDIATELY. IN RESPONSE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER FOCUSING ON A FEW IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO HELP STUDENTS AND STAFF RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND EITHER REJECTING PROPOSALS FOR EXTENDING SPENDING DEADLINES FOR OTHER PROGRAMS. SO WE NOT THE EDUCATE TRAINING. OVERLAP WITH THE USES FOR FEDERAL FUNDING SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT POSSIBLE FEDERAL FUNDS- FROM THE RECENT RELIEF PACKAGES WHICH CAN BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE LEGISLATURE ME JUST WANT TO CONSIDER HOW THE EDUCATOR TRAINING- PROPOSALS COULD BE BEST COMPLEMENTING THESE FEDERAL FUNDS. LASTLY RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CONSIDER REQUIRING CLEAR DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EDUCATOR TRAINING PROPOSALS SEVERAL OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS INCLUDE FEW DETAILS ON THE DELIVERABLES EXPECTED ACTIVITIES TO BE FUNDED SOME PROPOSALS DO NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC TYPES OF ACTIVITIES TO BE FUNDED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. OR LACK ROUTINE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE THINK IT'S AYE WISHING A CLEAR SET OF DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE PROPOSALS WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT AS INTENDED AND ACHIEVE THAT DESIRED OUTCOMES. WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE PERFECT TIME THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER PRESENTERS. NO NO THAT IS IT SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ME- SO MAYBE SOME QUESTIONS IN JUST A COMMENT- APPRECIATE THE- THE ADULT TO STUDENT RATIOS CONVERSATION- LISTEN IF THERE'S ONE WHITE BEST WAY TO RETAIN TEACHERS AND HELP OUR KIDS. IS TO LOWER CLASS SIZES CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE STILL HAS A LARGE CLASS SIZES IN THE NATION- FOR MANY YEARS I TAUGHT EIGHTH GRADE WITH THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTH GRADERS IN THE CLASSROOM AND THAT JUST IS. THAT'S TOUGH IT'S TOUGH ON THE KIDS IT'S TOUGH ON THE TEACHER. AND IT JUST YOU KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER. I SEE A LOT OF MONEY IN HERE FOR A LOT OF THINGS WE CAN EVEN THOUGH THE ONE THE ONE KEY THING WE DO AND ALSO EXERCISE IS TO LOWER. CLASS SIZES- BECAUSE IT'S BOTH- YOU KNOW PROVEN QUANTITATIVELY QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY THAT IT. IMPROVES A CHILD'S EXPERIENCE AND THEN ALSO HAVING- TWO CHILDREN ONE WENT THROUGH CLASS SIZE REDUCTION IN K. THREE. WHEN THEY DID NOT I THINK I SAID I BELIEVE I SEE A DIFFERENCE EVEN TODAY AND THAT. SO I APPRECIATE LEASE OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THAT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD ABOUT BECAUSE THAT THAT IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. A FOM MY PERSPECTIVE. I JUST REGARD WITH REGARD TO THE EDUCATOR AND SUPPORT PIPELINE THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S LIKE TONS OF MONEY LIKE PROBABLY TOO MUCH MONEY- BUT- THAT'S JUST MY PERSPECTIVE- AGAIN I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE LIST HERE- SEEMS SO YOU KNOW THAT THEY THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE NATIONAL BIRD SAID. THE BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHER THING. AND WHAT THAT REALLY DOES- IS THERE DATA THAT. TELLS US THAT'S A GREAT IDEA THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE RIGHT NOW. BUT I KNOW WE- WE PROMOTED THAT ABOUT WEALTH PRIDE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW WHEN THAT FIRST CAME ON THE SCENE AND- WE JUST NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S THE BEST PASSED. THE GO DOWN- WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT BACK TO THE CHAIR- CHAIR MCCARTY WILL TAKE IT BACK. THANK YOU THINK OF YOUR PRESENTATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU- I HAVE. A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE ON THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SO. THE DEPARTMENT OF A FROM THE FINANCE WITH THE WHO THE ONCE YOU GET YOUR. AMBER ALEXANDER'S HERE AND I CAN FEEL QUESTIONS ON THAT PROPOSAL OKAY YES THOSE THIS BUILT UPON THE PRIOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROPOSALS WITH THE- ECONOMICS FOR HOW IT'S GOING TO BE PAID FOR WITH THE MATCH REQUIREMENT TO. MAKE SURE HE'S ACTUALLY ARE FINANCIALLY VIABLE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT AND I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT COMMITTEE SCHOOLS JUST WANT TO SEE HOW THESE WOULD ACTUALLY. THE COMMONALITY- THE LANGUAGE THAT ACTUALLY WITH INTERVIEWS- I GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS LARGELY BUILT UPON THE LANGUAGE AND THAT WAS DRAFTED LAST YEAR AROUND THE FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SO IN THAT SENSE- YES IT IS CONSISTENT THAT LANGUAGE DID NOT HAVE THE MATH REQUIREMENT THAT IS A NEW PIECE- THAT OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE BUILT OUT FOR THE NAY REVISION- WE WOULD NOTE THAT BACK- MATCH REQUIREMENT- IS A EITHER CASH OR IN KIND AND WE'VE ALSO DRAFTED THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW FOR. THAT CONTRIBUTION TO COME FROM PARTNER ENTITIES- INCLUDING GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO THE BURDEN IN PROVIDING THAT MATCH WOULD NOT- FALL SQUARELY ON AND THE ONLY A WHICH WE THINK WOULD HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. IN THAT AREA. OKAY FAIR ENOUGH. M. THEN. GO AHEAD THANK. ONLY GONNA GONNA IN THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. NOTE ON THE 50% OF MATCH AGREE THAT IT MAY BE AN ISSUE FOR SOME SCHOOLS I WOULD ALSO IKE TO JUST FLAG AT THE TIMELINE IS DEPENDENT UPON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE THE CURRENT TIMELINE ON THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROJECT WAS BASED UPON THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION PREVIOUSLY BUT IF THE FUNDING MOVES FROM THAT NUMBER TO YOU. THE BILLIONS RANGE WE ARE LOOKING AT AN EXTENSION AN EXTENSION NEEDED FOR THE GRANT ADMINISTRATION PROCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT STATE OPERATIONS- TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM BASED UPON INCREASED FUNDING. GOTCHA OKAY AND THEN MOVING ON TO THE- TO THE TEACHER WORKFORCE SAID CERTAINLY THIS IS CRITICAL OF THE IT IN AND ALL- IN ALL OF. TWENTY YEARS AS FAR AS- MAKING SURE CAN WE CAN RECRUIT RECRUIT RETAIN- YEAH OUR PARTY TO WORK FORCE. WHAT THINK WHAT THINGS DO WE THINK ARE ARE UNIQUE AS FAR AS- POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF EARLY EDUCATORS WITH T. K. SPECIALLY. THAT THERE IS THE TWO TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM THE PART PROFESSIONALS WHO DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A TEACHER CREDENTIAL AND THEN THE TO KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY HE KNOWS THAT THE TYPICAL SINGLE SUBJECT CREDENTIAL FOR A K. TWELVE TEACHER. DO WE THINK THIS IS- IS ADEQUATE AND SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE DEAL NEEDS OF JUST OVERALL- NEED TO RECRUIT MORE TEACHERS FOR A K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND WITH THE EXPANSION OF T. K. NUMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ALL AND GO HEAD AND BEGIN SPEAKING ON ON THAT POINT AND THEN MAYBE PASS IT OFF TO THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING TO ADD MORE COMMENTS- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT A NUMBER OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN- DRAFTED INCLUDING THAT. A LARGE AYE ROAD MAP TO- PRE K. EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT. WERE DROPPED INTENTIONALLY TO INCLUDE THAT CREE QUE- WORKFORCE ANTI CASE SPECIFICALLY- ACT DR CITY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN. OF ANY. OTHER SPECIFIC. AND WE WERE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND- IN MAKING SURE OUR TEETH PARTNERS WORK WITH. YES YOU- CHAIRMAN MCCARTY OF THE COMMITTEE- I AGREE WITH EMBERS SAID COMMENTS AND- THE NEW TAKEN IN MAY REVISE HERE A MULTI YEAR MULTI FACETED SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT- AND THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY IN ORDER IN ORDER FOR US TO GET THE T. K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THE PRE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATORS WE NEED. OVER THE COMING YEARS SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THAT BUT- YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL PATHWAYS THAT CAN BE A LINE VERY WELL TO THE T. K. SPACE. AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT OVER HERE AT THE COMMISSION. TIGHTLIPPED SONNY JUST ASK A DIFFERENT WAY SAID YOU THINK AS WE X. AS WE EXPAND T. K. WHICH IN OUR DOING WHICH- HAS TO BE APPROVED FORCE FIRST BUT THAT'S PART OF THE BUDGET FOR EARLIER CHEN ITEM. DO YOU. THINK ALL THESE. TEACH PIPELINE IN AND TEACH TRAINING PRO. WILL ARE SUFFICIENT AS WE LOOK TO. EXPANDED T. K. WORKFORCE ESSENTIALLY TRIPLE THE EXISTING TICKET WORKFORCE FOR DO WE NEED. BY THE BOX AND FUTURE AS WELL- WELL CONTINUALLY WE SHOULD BE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX- IN ORDER TO KIND OF **** CONTINUALLY ASSESS WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS- AND WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS ADEQUATE- TO REALLY PURSUE- THE KINDS OF WORKFORCE. THAT WE NEED THE PEOPLE WHO. HAVE OPPORTUNITIES BASED ON THESE INVESTMENTS FROM THE GRANT PROGRAMS THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM THE CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAM THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE THERE FOR THE TEA CARE WORK FORCE. TO SUPPORT THEIR ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT THE APPROPRIATE CREDENTIAL TO WORK IN THAT SPACE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WHICH IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY. I THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ATTEMPT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY. IS THAT OUR PREPARATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ABSORB AND DEVELOP AND PREPARE THIS WORKFORCE WE KNOW THE MAY REVISE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS- BUT WE THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TARGET IN THAT SPACE AS WELL. A DOUBLING THE NUMBERS OF TEACHERS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO ADDRESS CURRENT AND CHRONIC SHORTAGES AND TO ADDRESS THE FUTURE NEEDS THAT T. K. WILL PRESENT. SURE MCCARTY. YES I LIKE HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'D LIKE TO DO AS MY COLLEAGUES THERE NETTLE MORGAN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WITH SO MANY NEW CHILDREN BEING SERVED IN TKA IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE WORK TO ADDRESS ON THE TKA- TEACHER PIPELINE. AND AS WE WELCOME ANY GRADE LEVEL TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE GET PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO RECRUITING AND SUPPORTING ENOUGH TEACHERS. TO TEACH THE THOUSANDS OF NEW STUDENTS WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE ENTERING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. THAT SAID THE CD DOES NOT THINK THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION IS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE NEEDS ADAMS THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF NEW TEACHERS THAT WILL BE NEEDED. TO SUPPORT A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL. OKAY THANK YOU- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WITH THAT WILL ALSO HOLD THIS ISSUE- OPEN. AND WITH THAT WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE PUBLIC% COMMENT. ON ANY OF THE THREE- ISSUES ON THE AGENDA TODAY. LATER THAT MAY REVISE. BUDGET THERE'S NO ONE IN THE ROOM OPERATOR WHO'S HERE TO TESTIFY SO WE CAN- PROCEED WITH THE- MODERATOR WHO'S FOCUSING ON TELEPHONE PARTICIPATION HELP.
