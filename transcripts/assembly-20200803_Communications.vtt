00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:53.376
COLLECT WORDS OF SIXTY SIX

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.379
MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR- THE

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:58.848
BUSINESS CHILI AN ADDITIONAL

00:56:58.915 --> 00:56:59.816
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO IN THAT

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.918
COULD BE GOOD IN THE FIGHT.

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.386
THERE QUESTIONS AND I'M BOTH IT

00:57:03.453 --> 00:57:05.054
WITH CAUGHT AND IN MY HOUSE

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:06.790
ABOUT A MORE OPPORTUNITY NOT

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.625
JUST STANDING ON BUT

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.827
DECISIONAL- DISCUSSIONS WITH

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:13.863
VARIOUS- STAKEHOLDERS ON ON HOW

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.765
WE CAN CONTINUE FUND- DIGITAL

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:18.434
POLLUTION ALL OUTSIDE OF THE-

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:19.269
THIS ONE BUT THE IS GOING TO

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:21.171
PICK A WE'RE GONNA HAVE FOR

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:25.175
SOMETIME TO COME SO DO YOU. THE

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.009
CHARGE SHOULD BE OR THE NO

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:29.145
SOURCES MEASURE POINT UP TO SEE

00:57:29.212 --> 00:57:34.284
A OF. I THINK WE KNOW THEN

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.251
WEREN'T THE DISCUSSIONS I KNOW

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:36.619
IT'S- I GATHER. THE BILL THAT

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:37.220
DOES EXTEND THE FEE WELL SO

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.488
WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH OF OUR

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:39.122
BILLS TO SEE HOW THEY CAN COME.

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:39.689
EACH OTHER AND OUT ACTIVELY

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:41.191
WORKED TOGETHER THAT. THANK YOU

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.592
BY THE CONCERNED BECAUSE IT

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.160
SEEMS TO ME THAT- IF THE

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.062
EXISTING PROGRAM ALREADY.

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.897
OVERSUBSCRIBED THAT THERE'S NO

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.732
WAY THAT WE CAN SET THIS GOAL

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:50.466
FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT THE

00:57:50.533 --> 00:57:52.702
MASSIVE. SOURCE OF REVENUE. AND

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.337
YOU KNOW THE AYE AYE THAT'S A

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:55.438
DISCUSSION AND WE NEED TO HAVE

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:56.840
AT THE SAME TIME TO DISCUSS THE

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:59.275
MERITS. OF CHANGING OUR GOALS

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:00.009
YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:01.311
FOR THOSE. SO AT THAT THAT SO

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:03.213
THAT'S A CONCERT AND I HAVE. I

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:03.813
ALSO WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.415
ADDRESS IT ANOTHER CONCERN THAT

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.016
WE HEARD IN OPPOSITION. WHICH

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:10.086
IT IS THE TECHNICAL. FIREMAN'S

00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:10.887
THAT ARE WRITTEN THIS BILL SO

00:58:10.954 --> 00:58:14.490
YOU HAVE. ACQUIRED ONE OF

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:15.859
TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.260
SYMMETRIC OPAL UPSTREAM AND

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:19.395
DOWNSTREAM BANDWIDTH. NOW OF

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:21.497
COURSE MOST CONSUMERS. UTILIZED

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:22.565
DOWNSTREAM MUCH MORE THAN

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.801
UPSTREAM IN FACT IT'S OVER 90%

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:25.802
WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.437
TECHNOLOGIES ARE ASYMMETRIC.

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:28.404
BECAUSE THEY PRIORITIZE

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:29.706
DOWNSTREAM DOWN WITH UPSTREAM

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.341
THAT WITH. A WHY HAVE YOU

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.743
CHOSEN. A SYMMETRIC STANDARD

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.245
FOR THIS DEFINITION. WELL WE

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:36.613
ACTUALLY TOOK AMENDMENTS AND WE

00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:38.781
ARE DOWN TO TWENTY FIVE THREE

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.116
WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL-

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.886
STANDARD. AND SO- WE'RE TWENTY.

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.521
THREE WITH GOAL OF TWENTY FIVE

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:47.624
TWENTY FIVE AND AS WE KNOW NOW.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.292
KIDS WITH FIVE YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.293
FIVE OF US IN THE HOUSE ALL IN

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:53.129
AS SOON. THE THOUGHT OF A

00:58:53.196 --> 00:58:55.665
DOWNSTREAM THREE OR ONE IS

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.600
ACTUALLY EVEN OUTDATED. YOU

00:58:57.667 --> 00:59:00.136
NEED YOU KNOW I THINK- WHEN YOU

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:01.838
LOOK AT THE FEDERAL FCC-

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:06.509
WEBSITE. THE ACTUALLY VIED BUT

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.044
NO ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:08.978
WHICH IS WHAT WE PUT IN HERE AS

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:12.382
A GOAL AND- IN ADDITION TO THE

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:12.982
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE SO WE

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:13.917
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:16.252
IN THIS DAY AND AGE IN AN OPEN

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.320
ENVIRONMENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.389
HAVE I'VE SEEN IN DOWNSTREAM

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:21.724
SO. TELL YOUR TAKE A MOMENT TO

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:23.159
CHAIR OF AN ISSUE THERE ARE

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:24.294
ONLY FIVE THREE YES WELL

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.528
THEY'RE NOT REFLECTED IN THE

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.730
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I DIDN'T

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.299
SEE THEM IN THE BILL SO WHEN

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.333
AND WHERE THOSE AMENDMENTS

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.636
TAKEN THOSE WERE TAKEN AT-

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.405
SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE. IN

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:38.908
OKAY WELL IT'S THAT'S I WILL RE

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:40.443
REVIEW THE BILL BUT THAT'S NOT

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.544
WHAT THE TEXT OF THE BILL SAID

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:43.446
SO I WILL LOOK INTO THAT SOME

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.647
MORE COULDN'T WE TALK A BIT

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.649
ABOUT LATENCY BECAUSE THAT'S

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:47.884
ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE A

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.986
CONCERN ABOUT SO YOU IN THE

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:52.221
DEATH AND DEFINITION OF AN

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:54.457
UNDERSERVED AREA YOU'VE GOT A

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:55.191
DEFINITE THE DEFINITION

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.093
INCLUDES LATENCY. TO BECOME

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.561
SERVE LATENCY HAS TO BE

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:01.097
SUFFICIENTLY LOW TO ALLOW REAL

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.498
TIME INTERACTIVE APPLICATIONS.

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:03.933
CAN EXPLAIN A BIT ABOUT WHAT

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.501
THAT MEANS TO YOU BECAUSE- IT

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.537
IT HAS. A VERY AMBIGUOUS

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:08.838
MEETING TO ME I MEAN IT'S IT

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:09.872
DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.107
INTERACTIVE APPLICATION YOU'RE

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:12.008
TALKING ABOUT A FOR PLAYING

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:15.578
POKER. THAT'S IT REQUIRES VERY-

01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:17.280
VERY HIGHLY CAN SEE IS

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.215
SUFFICIENT- IF WERE VIDEO

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.150
CONFERENCING- A MODERATE AMOUNT

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.518
OF LATENCY A SUFFICIENT AND A

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.354
FOR PLAYING A VIDEO GAME LIKE

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.555
FOR NOT ONLINE YOU NEED VERY

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:28.224
LOW LATENCY SO- SO CAN CAN YOU

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.826
TALK ABOUT. WHY THAT WHICH IS

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:30.626
IN THERE AND WHY IT'S NOT MORE

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:34.397
SPECIFIC. THE LOOSELY AND ALSO-

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.466
REACH OUT TO ERNESTO AS OF WELL

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.735
IF HE HAS ADDITIONAL INPUT BUT-

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.536
AS I MENTIONED OF IN ADDITION

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.805
TO THE BILL MANY. KIDS HAVE TO

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.407
BE AN INTERACTIVE. GUILLEMETS

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.042
WE HAVE NO CHOICE AND GENTLY

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.577
DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.

01:00:47.643 --> 01:00:50.146
NO MY CHILD WAS JUST ON A

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:53.950
MINECRAFT CODING CLASS. IN

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:58.821
YOUR- NEED HIGHER THE BILL.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:01.190
RIGHT AS WE AS WE HAVEN'T. I

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.358
AND SO THAT IS IN THE REAR IS

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:02.892
THAT WE NEED TO ADD THESE

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:03.559
TECHNICAL ISSUES AND WE ALL CAN

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.293
CONTINUE INVESTING PUBLIC

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.195
DOLLARS IN SLOW SPEEDS THESE

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:08.064
ARE PUBLIC DOLLARS REPAIR FUNDS

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.632
TAXPAYER DOLLARS BEING

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.367
UTILIZING NEED TO BE INVESTED

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:11.801
IN THIS FUTURE PROOF

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:12.969
TECHNOLOGY. WITH THESE

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.071
TECHNICAL CHANGES BUT- ERNESTO

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.340
IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL INPUT

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.209
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT AS WELL.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.944
CERTAINLY SENATOR THANK YOU-

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.913
NOT SENATOR DID THE EXPLAIN

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.648
KIND OF THE LEAGUE AND SEE HOW

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.383
THAT WORKS RIGHT NOW WITH WITH

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.785
THESE NETWORKS- THE

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.319
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.088
DOES A FAIRLY HOLISTIC ANALYSIS

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.089
ALL THE DIFFERENT TACK NEVER

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.891
TAKE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN THE

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.659
FUTURE PROOFING. I

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.828
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THAT TWENTY

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:39.896
AVERAGING TWENTY MILLISECONDS

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.964
OR LESS IS ESSENTIALLY KIND OF

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:42.865
THE INDUSTRY STANDARD WHAT LOW

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.868
LATENCY IS- IT MET BY A CABLE

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.003
NETWORK THAT ARE HAVE

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.538
IDENTIFIED WERE BUILT WITH THEM

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.239
AND IT'S MEANT BY FIVE THE HOME

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:52.775
NETWORKS EVEN IN IN IN VERY

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.577
DIFFICULT SEVERAL MARKETS. I IT

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:57.313
THIS STANDARD THAT- SPACEX IS

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.082
SHOOTING FOR AS PART OF THEIR

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.683
DEPLOYMENT OF LITTLE LITTLE

DEPEND ON NOW. STREAMING

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.708
HIGHWAY TO BECAUSE TAKES A VERY

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:26.375
LONG TIME THE INFORMATION

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.077
REACHED THE SO BEFOREEVENTUALLY MAKE IT BACK DOWN TO

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.545
EARTH TO CONNECT WEAPON THAT.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.384
WHICH- A LOT OF THE FRICTION IT

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:36.986
IN THE WIRE MR COCHRAN IF I

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:38.521
COULD ASK SINCE YOU'RE AN

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.722
EXPERT AND YOU BROUGHT UP LOWER

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.958
ORBIT SATELLITES. I UNDERSTAND

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:43.359
SOME OF THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS A

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.228
GOAL OF GETTING LEADING LATENCY

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.929
BELOW TWENTY MILLISECONDS SO

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:50.299
WOULDN'T THAT QUALIFY. UNDER

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.602
THE STANDARD. IT WOULD. IN

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:57.507
TERMS OF THE- QUESTION OF- SAID

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.542
THE NUMBERS BUT THE THING WITH

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.646
LOW OR SATELLITE AND KIND OF

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.815
THE LIMIT THERE IS. IT CAPACITY

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.416
INCREASING SERVICES SO IF.

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.584
PROVING BOB REQUIREMENT BUT THE

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:11.020
TV NEEDS LOOK INTO. LAST PART

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.388
OF IT AFTER THE PROOF WILL OF

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.589
INFRASTRUCTURE RAMPS UP

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.625
SPENDING- BECAUSE AS FAR AS I

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.160
UNDERSTAND THE BASICS AND KIND

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.227
OF THE OTHER LOW EARTH ORBIT

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.996
SATELLITE PLANS DON'T REALLY

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.464
RELY ON GOVERNMENT MONEY TO

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:22.665
BUILD IT OUT AND IF THERE'S

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:23.466
SOME REASONS FOR THAT NOW

01:03:23.533 --> 01:03:25.801
EXPLAIN THAT- IF YOU WISH. BY

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.870
ALTERING THEIR POTENTIAL YOU

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.739
YOU'VE ANSWERED MY QUESTION BOB

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.607
BUT IT'S JUST OKAY I DON'T

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:32.975
<u>PEND THE COMMITTEES TIME ON A</u>

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.610
TECHNICAL DISCUSSION HERE BUT-

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:36.445
I HAVE A CONCERN THAT THOSE

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:38.080
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS MIGHT

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.515
NOT MIGHT NEED TO BE REWORKED.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.817
AND IN PARTICULAR I MEAN AT THE

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.653
ARE. YOU KNOW ME I'M A

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.421
TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND- I OWN A

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.789
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY I'M

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.424
CERTAINLY VERY INTERESTED IN

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.525
MAKING SURE THAT ALL

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.562
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:54.297
BROUGHT. APPROVED AN INTERNET I

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:54.897
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WERE VERY

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:57.300
FAR. ABOUT WAY WE GO IT. IN SO

01:03:57.366 --> 01:03:58.634
MY FIRST CONCERN IS I RAISES

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.036
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN ATTACK

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.037
ATTACHED A FUNDING SOURCE TO

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.206
THIS. AND THE EXISTING PROGRAMS

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:04.941
ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED. BUT MY

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:07.143
SECOND CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:07.877
ARE PUTTING OUR THUMB ON THE

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.912
SCALES AND- WRITING THE

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:10.913
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS TO

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.181
FAVOR ONLY ONE DELIVERY

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:14.016
TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS FIBER. AND

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.051
WE HAVE OTHER DELIVERY

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.119
TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.487
EVEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.156
SERVING CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:21.791
COMMUNITIES LIKE WHAT LOWER

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:22.925
WITHOUT RIVER ORBIT SATELLITES

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:23.960
I MEAN THAT THAT DOESN'T

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.728
REQUIRE A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:26.629
ONCE YOU PUT THOSE SATELLITES

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:27.763
IN ORBIT THAT COULD BE A VERY

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:29.432
APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:29.999
YEAH AND I JUST DON'T THINK

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:32.001
IT'S FAIR. TO JUDGE AND SAY THE

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.669
FIBERS THE ONLY THING THAT

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.605
WE'RE GOING TO. AWARD GRANTS

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:38.908
FOR- SO WE- BUT- CHERISH

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:39.575
REGULATE IF YOU'D LIKE TO

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:40.743
RESPOND TO THAT THAT THE FUTURE

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.078
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.347
HAVEN'T DICTATED FIBER. JUST IS

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:45.615
FUTURE PROOF TECHNOLOGY WOULD

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:48.484
COULD WHICH COULD BE A HYBRID.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.319
WHICH IS MANY AT THE WHICH MANY

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:51.120
OF THE CAMP MANY SAY THAT THE

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.055
HALF. AND SO UP WITH THOSE

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:57.326
SPECIFIC. AS AS MENTIONED

01:04:57.393 --> 01:04:58.094
TWENTY FIVE THREE AND THE LATE.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.096
YOU CAN SEE ISSUE AS WELL SO.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.031
THERE ARE. NO KNOWLEDGE TO YOUR

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.065
POINT OKAY AND I WERE VERY

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.668
CLEAR. THE BILL WOULD YOU ARE

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:09.605
MOVING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:10.606
FOR ME FIVE. PERCENT DOWN TO

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:11.140
AND THREE MAKE A PER SE.

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.908
UPSTREAM CRAP. OKAY OTHER

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:20.650
FURTHER. I MISS STARS ORBIT. I

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.051
SHARE YOUR CONCERN I WITH

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:24.687
CALIFORNIANS DISTANCE LEARNING-

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.522
DURING COVE IN NINETEEN AS WELL

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.923
AS A NUMBER OF PARENTS WHO ARE

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.059
COLOR WORKING ENSURING THAT WE

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.060
HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS TO

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.329
EVERYONE IS OF UTMOST

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:36.632
IMPORTANCE- I DO I HAVE A

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:37.633
CONCERN OF USING THE WORD

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.934
FUTURE PROOFING BECAUSE IF WE

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.736
LOOK AT THE TECHNOLOGY TWENTY

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:41.971
YEARS AGO. AND WHAT IT'S GOING

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.073
TO BE IN TWENTY YEARS SO MAYBE

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.608
THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN GET

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.244
NEUTRAL AND THE LANGUAGE AROUND

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:49.512
WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THERE

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:52.181
IS- BECAUSE I THINK THAT WILL

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:53.416
CONTINUE TO CHANGE SO WE WANT

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:55.151
TO MAKE SURE. THAT NEW

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.686
TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.454
DISINCENTIVE EYES FROM SERVING

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.056
RURAL AND UNDERSERVED

01:06:00.122 --> 01:06:02.358
COMMUNITIES SO THE FIRST THING.

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.361
THE SECOND THING IS I WANT TO

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.764
REITERATE TWENTY FIVE THREE NOT

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:09.365
TWENTY FIVE FIVE SEVEN THAT'S

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.066
REALLY IMPORTANT. COULD YOU

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.400
TOUCH ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.002
ERNESTO WHO WAS ONE OF YOUR

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.869
WITNESSES IT WAS A LITTLE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:15.871
DIFFICULT TO HEAR HIM SO MAYBE

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:18.474
YOU CAN REPEAT- ONE OF THE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:19.775
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS THE

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:21.744
MISUSE OF IT WHEN YOU CHECK RE

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.713
CHANGE THE STANDARD TO TWENTY

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.648
FIVE THREE. THE MISUSE THAT

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.383
COULD HAPPEN I THINK MAYBE THIS

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.784
IS THE OF THE CONCERN OF SOME

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:31.420
OF THE COMMITTEE. THE MISUSE

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.356
FOR MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS FOR

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:34.290
SOME OF THINGS WHERE YOU'RE

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.658
JUST EXPANDING ALREADY

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:38.694
PROFITABLE AREAS. AND NOT

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:39.628
REALLY GETTING AT THE LACK OF

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.864
PROVISION OF BROADBAND ACCESS

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.165
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THE

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.734
TRULY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.302
WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. SO COULD

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:50.272
YOU ADDRESS HOW YOUR BILL IS

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:53.509
TURNING THAT HOW YOU PROVIDING

01:06:53.576 --> 01:07:00.182
THE MIST DOSE. OF THIS FILE.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.785
AND THEN ALSO. CAN YOU MAYBE

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.653
GIVE US ALSO THE HISTORY OF THE

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.688
FUNDING ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:06.789
THERE'S BEEN GOING ON AND YOU

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.257

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.291
IT AND SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.826
THE OPPORTUNITY ALSO TO TALK

01:07:10.893 --> 01:07:13.329
ABOUT HOW THAT'S EVOLVED- AND

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:14.630
MAYBE WHAT WE CAN EXPECT AS A

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:16.065
COMMITTEE IF THIS BILL GOES OUT

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.299
OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SURE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.868
AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:21.070
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- IN TERMS OF

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.272
THE WHOLE UNSERVED THERE'S NO

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.940
SHIFT IN PRIOR FROM PREVIOUS.

01:07:25.007 --> 01:07:27.276
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A SURVEY OF

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.210
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.645
COMPLETELY OFF THE GRID

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.113
UNSERVED AND SO THAT WILL

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.749
REMAIN A PRIORITY HERE- IN THIS

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.985
BILL- OF COURSE WE'VE EXPANDED

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.853
WHAT UNSERVED ACTUALLY- LOOKS

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.688
LIKE MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:41.123
HIGHER THRESHOLD FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.392
ARE IN VERY HIGH POVERTY AREAS

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:46.429
TO BE ACCESS FUNDS UP OR COULD

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:48.831
HAVE BEEN A HOLD OF THAT YOU

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.434
ACCESS THESE FUNDS AT NO THERE

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.737
WERE NO WERE NUMBER. TEN FOR SO

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:57.473
WE'RE EXPENSE TO GET FOLKS ON

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.374
COMPLETELY BE WE START BUILDING

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:02.077
AGAIN WITH SPEEDS OF TWENTY

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:04.914
FIVE THREE AT LEAST IN THIS

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:12.988
THAT IS YOUR. HOW ARE. HOW HI

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:13.589
JIM THAT'S GONNA WORK IN REAL

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.658
LIFE IF BILL PUT INTO LAW I HAD

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:16.892
A THAT HOW DO THEY PRAYER THEY

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:19.495
SAY. ALL UP WITH IN THE WORLD.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:20.863
NO BROADBAND CAN BE THEY GET A

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.997
PROOF AND ALL YES IS THERE ARE

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.032
NONE THEN WE CAN GO TO THE

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:24.867
INCOME. CONSTRAINED UNDER

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.970
COMMUNITIES AT ONLY ABOUT. THAT

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.205
YEAH THAT IS CORRECT OKAY

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.506
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.274
WITH YOU SEE RIGHT NOW THIS

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:32.908
FIFTY FOUR APPLICATIONS I THINK

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.877
ALMOST ALL OF THEM. OR ABOUT

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.545
90% OF THEM ARE ARE RURAL

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.080
COMMUNITIES OF THAT ARE

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.715
UNSERVED BUT AGAIN- YOU KNOW

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.217
BECAUSE OF UP APPLICATION HICK

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.351
UPS THEY MAY NOT MAKE IT

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:43.185
THERE'S A LOT OF VARIETY OF

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.453
DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT THE PC

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.322
MAY NOT APPROVE ALL ALL. YOU

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:48.524
KNOW FIFTY FOUR OF THEM- BUT I

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.792
HOPE THEY DO- THEIR OWN ROLE

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.294
UNSERVED AREAS- AND THEN THE

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:53.662
SECOND TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:57.333
FUNDING OF COURSE- THIS IS A-

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:02.171
BUT THE TRAJECTORY FROM. THESE

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.406
A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA BILL

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:06.041
WHO BASICALLY LOOK LOOK AT

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:07.810
THESE FUNDS A THREE HUNDRED

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.144
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER A

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:11.313
FOUR YEAR PERIOD. WE'RE JUST-

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.016
PROGRAMMATIC THE CHANGING YOU

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:17.319
KNOW WHAT THAT. IS BUT- WHAT WE

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.922
WANT TO DO OF COURSE IS HAVE

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:21.056
FULL DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.125
WITH- LIMóN KURT IF YOU TWO

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.994
ARE VERY MUCH INVEST THIS IS

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.061
THE DISK. AND OF YOU WHO WOULD

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:27.429
TO BE INVESTED IS AS WELL WE'D

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.064
LOVE TO HAVE THAT TO TALK ABOUT

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:32.501
NOT JUST THE CALIFORNIA

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.369
SERVICES FUND. AS WE KNOW THAT

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.170
UP. YOU KNOW THE- SIR ONE IS

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.739
ONE OPTION BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.274
OTHER GRANTS AVAILABLE THERE'S

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:38.974
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AT THE

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:42.011
FCC IS JUST NOW- ALLOWING FOR

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.179
RURAL COMMUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:45.614
AS WELL AS- DIFF DIFFERENT

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:46.649
DISCUSSIONS AND HOW WE CAN

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:48.751
LEVERAGE BOTH FEDERAL. UP A

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.252
FEDERAL DOLLARS AND HAVE AN

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.621
ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT- OTHER

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:54.456
MEASURES TO CONTINUE FUNDING

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.325
THESE PRIORITIES. SO THERE'S A

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.260
LOT OF DISCUSSION HAPPENING ON

01:09:58.327 --> 01:09:58.794
THAT I KNOW THE SENSE OF

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.929
URGENCY IN THIS BUT WE HAVE TO

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.564
START MAKING THESE. CHANGES NOW

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:05.167
IN MY OPINION. IF WE ADDRESS MY

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.236
QUESTION ABOUT ANSWER ATHLETIC

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:08.871
QUESTIONS AT ONE TIME IS. LIKE

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:12.341
PARKS THEM OUT- WHAT ABOUT THE

AHEAD. OF COMMENTING PREVIOUSLY

RESPECT TO SHIFTING THE FOCUS

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.730
FROM UNDERSERVED AND RURAL A TO

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.466
THAT OF THE- OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:45.000
THAT MIGHT HAVE THE

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:46.268
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE LIKE IN

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.314
BEING- OF THE MAIN FOCUS MY

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.216
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OF THE

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:04.053
FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION OF VERSES

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.187

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.927
THAT'S A GREAT POINT AS WELL-

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:12.494
TO ENSURE THAT EOPLE DON'T

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:13.829
JUST HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:14.630

WHAT EXACTLY WHY WE WANTED

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:30.746

TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:22.362
BEING CONSTANT CONTACT WHEN

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:55.628
GENERATORS FROM ARIZONA TO BE

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:56.962
ABLE TO KEEP THEIR NETWORK

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.864
RUNNING AFTER THEIR NETWORK

HOURS BUT- THAT THIS IS THIS

02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:44.129
BILL WILL MEAN LARGER

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:45.664
GENERATORS WOULD NEED TO BE

ABLE TO BE BROUGHT IN. TO THAT

02:06:47.499 --> 02:06:49.568
MOST OF THE SITES AGAIN

EIGHTEEN T. I'M AMUSING ROUGH

02:06:51.103 --> 02:06:52.237

MINIMUM LEVEL OF THE NETWORK

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:04.783
RUNNING ALREADY- AND NOW THIS

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.051
WOULD BE REQUIREMENTS BUT
