IF THOSE THINGS WERE TRIGGERED BY SOME OTHER COVERED PAYROLL -- THIS BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED SINCE HAVE ENTERED OUR HOUSE EXCLUDING. ALL LAND MOVEMENT WHICH IS ACTUALLY A CONFUSING A CONCEPT BECAUSE IT COULD GET INTO ISSUES OF EARTHQUAKE. SO THAT IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT THE BILL.

ELEVEN NINETY FOUR WHICH I'M PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF SENATOR LARA IS TO REALLY ENHANCE THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE USING PRIVATE. BUS SERVICES AND LODGING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT PROHIBITS THOSE ORGANIZATIONS FROM SHARING. THAT THE NAMES OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE USING BUSES OR USING. THEY THE LODGING TO ANYONE OTHER THAN CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE TOO MANY EXAMPLES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY NEWMAN OUT IN THE WEST WHERE. MOTELS AND HOTELS AND PRIVATE BUS COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING NAMES OF HISPANIC SOUNDING GUESTS. TO ICE AND FOR ICE ENFORCEMENT AND TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW GETTING SWEPT UP OR HAVING THEIR PRIVACY VIOLATED EVEN THOUGH THEIR CITIZENSHIP MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN BE IN QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T A TECHNIQUE. THAT ICE IS USING TO TARGET SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED FROM SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB. ELEVEN NINETY FOUR THEY MISSED DOWN MS BAKER YOUR RECOMMENDS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I SAW THIS -- LEGISLATION IN THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT AN IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT WE HAD IN THAT COMMITTEE THAT THE CURRENT FORM OF THE BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS. AND THAT IS HOW CENTRAL LODGING AND BUS SERVICES AND TRANSPORTATION IS TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IT IS THAT WE NOT SET UP BARRIERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ONE OF THE HOT SPOTS FOR IS AT HOTELS IT'S AT LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS IT'S IN OUR BUS SERVICE THAT'S GOING ACROSS STATE LINES SO I OF AS I MENTIONED TO THE AUTHOR WHEN HE CAME AND TESTIFIED THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE FIND A WAY TO FIX THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BILL HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS SEVERE. ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THREE OF THE FBI'S TOP THIRTEEN HOT SPOTS. MAKING BARRIERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN LODGING AND TRANSPORTATION IS EXACTLY HOW WE GO BACKWARDS IN FIGHTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING I VERY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTES. THANK YOU MS BAKER. SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. ON THE ITEM MISTER STONE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST TO POINT OUT THIS IS NOT PREVENT THAT INFORMATION FROM GOING TO CALIFORNIA. LAW ENFORCEMENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE WITH TYPICALLY CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS. INVOLVED IN THAT THIS ARISES FROM TOO MANY OF THOSE NAMES BEING GIVEN THE ICE. TYPICALLY AS AN IN AS A CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT NOT HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK IF THE HOTELIERS AND THE BUS SERVICES WERE LITTLE WORTH IN FACT FOCUS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND NOT JUST ON CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. THIS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT ISSUE UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS A TREND THAT WE'RE SEEING AND CALIFORNIANS DESERVE BETTER I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH THAT CLARK LOCAL ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. THE DESIRE TO VOTE ON MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF THOSE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL. CLOSE ROLE TOWN ABOUT AYE AYES FORTY SIX KNOWS. EIGHTEEN THAT MEASURE PASSES.

ELEVEN TWENTY NINE CORPORATE. SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR MINING AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT ORDERS. MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY NINE ON BEHALF OF CENTER MONEY WILL CORRECT AN INJUSTICE FOUND IN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FAMILY LAW WHERE ONLY CERTAIN SURVIVORS. OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE PROTECTED FROM BEING FORCED TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE ABUSIVE SPOUSE AT THE END OF A MARRIAGE. CURRENT LAW SHIELDS VICTIMS OF ATTEMPTED [inaudible] SALT FROM HAVING TO PAY THEIR ABUSER SPOUSAL SUPPORT ATTORNEY FEES AND FUTURE INCOME FROM INTEREST IN THEIR PENSION A RETIREMENT. SURVIVORS OF OTHER FORMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOWEVER DO NOT RECEIVE THIS PROTECTION. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THIS IN EQUITY BY EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY OF PROTECTIONS FOR ALL SURVIVORS THROUGH BIFURCATED SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THE COURTS WITH GUIDANCE ON HOW AND WHEN TO AWARD SUPPORT. UP BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF THESE PROHIBITIONS BY PROVIDING THE COURT WITH DISCRETION TO SET ASIDE THE BILL'S PROHIBITIONS UPON REVIEW OF DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF THE CONVICTED PERSONS OWN HISTORY. AS A SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH THAT RESPECT WE ASK DR VOTE. THE REST YOU SEEN NO DISCUSSION DEBATE. CLUB CLUB IN THE ROLE. ON MEMBERS. IS A LITTLE MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE CLERK WILL. CLOSE ROLE AND TALLY VOTE. I FIFTY THREE THOSE ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WHERE FILE ITEM. ONE SEVENTY THREE S. B.. ONE HUNDRED SEPARATE. SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED BY SENATOR DELEON AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO ENERGY. HE'S GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS IT'S CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT UNFORGIVING CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO FURTHER SLOW THE CRISIS A METER. TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE GOALS A CENTERPIECE OF OUR CLIMATE STRATEGIES HAS BEEN CLEANING UP OUR ELECTRICAL GRID. WELL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PUSHING CALL A SUPER POLLUTANTS THAT'S NO LONGER COST EFFECTIVE. CALIFORNIA DECIDED YEARS AGO TO SLOWLY AND STEADILY REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS TO POWER OUR ECONOMY. EVERY TIME CALIFORNIA HAS SET A TARGET FOR CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY WE HAVE BLOWN RIGHT THROUGH THAT TARGET. THREE YEARS AGO WE SET OUR PS SCHOOLS AT 50% BY TWENTY THIRTY AT THAT TIME WE THOUGHT GOING FROM 33%. BY 202250% BY TWENTY THIRTY WITH AMBITIOUS BUT WE WERE WRONG. THE FACT IS THAT MANY ENERGY RETAILERS ARE ALREADY NEARING THAT 50% RENEWABLE ENERGY A FULL DECADE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM WE NEED TO KEEP GOING IN AIM HIGHER. S. B. ONE HUNDRED BILLS ON SIXTEEN YEARS OF SUCCESS AND PUT CALIFORNIA PASSED A 100% CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ACCELERATE OUR CURRENT 50% TARGET FROM TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN I WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW RPF BENCHMARK BY. AB 60% BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS MEASURE WOULD THEN CREATE A PLANNING GOAL PUTTING CALIFORNIA PATH TO REACH A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE USING A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL STANDARD WHICH MEANS WE ARE EXCLUDING. CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL HYDROELECTRIC CAPACITY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. THERE'S ALSO A FINAL 40% PLANNING GOAL THAT STATES THAT THE PLAN TO REACH A 100% MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MATTER THE PROTECT THE RELIABILITY OF THE GRID. IT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY AND REASONABLE PRICE INCREASES ON RATEPAYERS. THE 40% GOAL CONTAINS NO MANDATES AND NO PENALTIES BUT DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATION TO DESIGN A PLAN THAT WOULD REACH THAT GOAL. ONCE THE ADMINISTRATION DESIGNS THAT PLAN IT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO FUTURE LEGISLATURE SO THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE SAID TO YOU DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR POWER. IT COMES BACK HERE. WHILE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS BUSY ATTACKING THE LUNGS OF ALL AMERICANS CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. GETTING RID OF ALL DIRTY ENERGY. CLEAN ENERGY IS A PILLAR OF OUR ECONOMY AND IT'S HERE TO STAY. I HOPE WILL LEAD THE WAY TODAY THIS IS OUR CHANCE NOT ONLY TO LEAD THE WORLD IN FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE BUT TO STRENGTHEN OUR MIDDLE CLASS FOR DECADES TO COME WITH QUALITY JOBS. THAT CAN SUPPORT FAMILIES AND LIFT UP COMMUNITIES. PASSING SB ONE HUNDRED SAY IT'S NOT ONLY POSSIBLE IT'S CRITICAL. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY CAN IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER MR MATHIS YOUR RECOMMENDS. ARE YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW LET'S THAT THE TICKET TO A 100% RENEWABLES LIED SAW AND GET RID OF THE CAP ON OUR HYDROELECTRIC DAM SO WE CAN GET UP 290% TODAY. THIS BILL FAILS TO DO THAT. THIS BILL DOESN'T HELP JUMPSTART THINGS LIKE BIOMASS. IT'S NOT A 100% THERE. WE TALK ABOUT LET'S NOT PASS THIS ON TO THE REPAIR LETS YOU KNOW WE WE'VE REACHED ALL THESE GREAT GOALS WITH. RENEWABLES BUT AT THE SAME TIME. OUR FAMILIES BACK HOME OF PAY THE PRICE. WITH AN INCREASE IN THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS EVERY YEAR AS WE'VE TRIED TO ACHIEVE THIS. IF WE TRULY. HONEST TO GOD WHEN HE GETS A GET RID OF THE CAP ON OUR HYDRO DAMS LET'S BUILD MORE DAMS IN MAKE THEM HYDRO DAMS. AND THAT'S A GREAT WAY WE CAN GET THERE. BUT SO FAR WILL YOU SEEN IN THE STATE IS NO DO DAMS. IN WERE NOT CHANGING THE CAPITA HYDRO SO UNTIL THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES THAT WHICH I SUGGESTED TO THE AUTHOR MONTHS AGO. TO ACTUALLY GET US THERE. IT IS NOT A 100% THEIR MEMBERS I ASK YOU FOR NO VOTE LET'S GET THIS RIGHT. IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE A 100% LET'S DO IT THROUGHHYDRO. AND NOT. ALL THIS OTHER FAKE NONSENSE. MISS FRIEDMAN YOUR ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS [inaudible] THERE IS. NO OTHER ISSUE BUT CLIMATE. THERE IS NO OTHER ISSUE BUT CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. TO OUR PLANET. THE ONLY THING THAT THE SCIENTISTS GOT WRONG. WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE? WAS THE RATE AT WHICH IT IS OCCURRING. IT'S OCCURRING FASTER THAN PROJECTIONS. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING. TO TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO. CLIMATE CHANGE WAS FIRST DISCUSSED. IN THE PRESS AND IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. EVEN THEN THE AMOUNT OF COAL THAT. COAL THAT WAS BEING PUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WAS BEGINNING TO WARM THE PLANET. AND SCIENTISTS WERE DISCUSSING. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? IF THOSE CARBON EMISSIONS CONTINUE. WE ARE SEEING [inaudible] FAMINE [inaudible] WAR [inaudible] DISRUPTION [inaudible] REFUGEES DISEASE ALL DIRECTLY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE ALL OVER THE PLANET. I DON'T NO WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE ENORMITY OF THIS ISSUE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULTFOR PEOPLE. TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE. THE THREAT IS SO GRAVE. THAT WE CAN'T WRAPPER ON OUR MINDS AROUND IT. IT'S SO OVERWHELMING THAT IT LEADS TO A KIND OF PARALYSIS. THAT LEADS TO PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT. WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO WHATEVER WE CAN? BECAUSE A BILL MAYBE ISN'T AS PERFECT OR EXACTLY AS WE WERE AS SOMEONE WOULD LIKE. I THINK THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS THAT WE ARE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS SESSION. I AM A PROUD AUTHOR OF SP. ONE HUNDRED AND LET ME TELL YOU ANOTHER REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT EVEN KNOW CALIFORNIA ONLY REPRESENTS A SMALL PORTION OF THE WORLD'S EMISSIONS. WHAT WE DO HERE IS NOTICED? BY THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE BILL ON THE PLANET. AND WE SET THE TONE. EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ABSCONDED. ITS ROLE AS A WORLD LEADER ON SO MANY ISSUES WE IN CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WORLD ON THIS ISSUE. AND THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO DO THAT. I WAS VERY HONORED LAST YEAR TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE COUNCIL OF PARTY'S TO THE PARIS ACCORD IS ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY REPRESENTATIVES. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM AROUND THE WORLD WHO CAME AND SAID HOW IS CALIFORNIA ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE IN GERMANY WE IN. BRAZIL WE IN MANY AN THE SO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES WHO CAME UP TO SPEAK. SAID WE ARE WANTING TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD WE WANT TO LEARN FROM YOU. TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SEND THAT SIGNAL NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE WORLD THAT IT'S TIME TO INVEST. OUR SCIENTIFIC ENERGY ARE FINANCIAL POWER AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN RENEWABLE ENERGIES MEMBERS PLEASE SHOW THE WORLD WHO WAS WATCHING WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT SP ONE HUNDRED TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN MISTER LEVINE [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE HUNDRED THERE ISN'T A POLITE WAY TO SAY. THAT WE ARE LOSING THE BATTLE. ON CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND SB. ONE HUNDRED PUTS US ON A PATH TO WIN THE WAR. WE HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO SEQUESTER CARBON TO TAKE IT OUT OF OUR ATMOSPHERE TO SLOW DOWN THE GLOBAL WARMING THAT'S MELTING. THE ARCTIC CAPS AND THE GLACIERS. AND I CHANGING THE CLIMATE ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY. AND CAN SHOW THE WORLD THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES WE WILL TAKE THAT BATTLE ALL THE WAY ON TO VICTORY HIGHER TONIGHT THOUGH. THEY WISH LEVINE MR MCCARTY URANUS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THAT EIGHTEEN IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN OUR EFFORT TO BATTLE CLIMATE CHANGE. A WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE TRUE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ADVANTAGES OF A CARBON FREE GRID HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS AND CLEAN ENERGY HAVE BEEN CREATED. BY IS WHEN I TAKE US DOWN A QUICK -- MEMORY LANE WHEN THIS FIRST THIS ISSUE WAS FIRST PROPOSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO BY SENATOR BYRON SHARE. THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STRATEGY BACK THEN WAS THE GOAL OF 25%. AND THE NAY SAYERS SAID NO WAY CAN'T HAPPEN. AS OUR FLOOR JOCKEY FROM SAN DIEGO JUST SAID WE BLEW PAST THAT. THAT'S FORTY EIGHT YEARS TO TWO THOUSAND AND TEN SANDERSON MIDIAN CAME BACK PUSHED UP 233%. NAY SAYERS SAID NO WAY WE CAN DO IT IT WILL JACK UP OUR OUR ENERGY BILLS THAT ALL HURTS OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. BOTH THOSE THINGS TURN OUT TO BE FALSE FEARS LATER WE CAME UP WITH ANOTHER MEASURE TO GO 250%. AND NOW WE'RE GOING 21100% BECAUSE HAVING A TRIGGER OUT THERE AND INDICATOR TO THE MARKETS WILL SHOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. AND IT'LL SET A STAGE WHERE WE CAN REALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. LASTLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ON ISSUES LIKE HYDRO HYDRO ELECTRIC -- IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR RIGHT HERE IN OUR* TERRITORY. BECAUSE IF YOU COMBINE THE RP ASSN HIJO R.* -- FOR EXAMPLE MINUTES OBVIOUS WHAT POWER ENTITY BUT ALREADY HAVE BILL ALLOWS HYDRO AND OTHER -- IT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW AND THIS WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE A CLEANER BETTER MORE EFFICIENT. AND RESILIENT READ AND PUT US ON UP ON A PATH. TO A FULLY DE CARBONIZED ELECTRIC GRID IN A HEALTHIER AND STRONGER CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY DR CHOI YOUR RECKLESS. THANK YOU SPEAKER. I RISE TO OPPOSE SOFT TO DISPEL. THIS BILL LOCKYER INCREASES SIDE THE EXISTING RENEWABLE LA PUT FOR YOUR STANDARD ARE PURCHASING MANDATE. FOR ELECTRICITY SUPPLIERS SO TO A 60% BY. TWENTY THIRTY THIS IS THE ABOLITION ASSOCIATE POLICY TO ACHIEVE A QUARTER OF WHAT. 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND DOES ZERO COBB ONE ELECTRICAL GENERATION RESOURCES UP BY. TWO THOUSAND FORTY FIVE NO EVIDENCE HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO SHOW THAT. A 100% CLEAN ENERGY GORE IS TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE OR IT WOULD NOT EVEN BE AFFORDABLE. THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT THE NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS SO EXPERIENCED. ENERGY OF POVERTY IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MEANING THAT THE DAYS SPENT THE MORE THAN 10% OF THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOME ON ELECTRICITY AND UP NATURAL GAS. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AS ARE ALREADY A CRISIS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. WHY WAS THIS A BODY DOUBLE DOWN AND THE FURTHER INCREASES COSTS ON STRUGGLING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THE POLICY IS SO ADOPTED THE HERE HAVE A DRASTIC ON INTENDED TO CONSEQUENCES? CALIFORNIA ALREADY HOUSE AT RAFT ALL FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY MANDATES. THAT THOUGH WE ARE GOING TO LOSE. STRUGGLE TO A TEE. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR MORE. IF YOU ARE CONCERNED. ASKED WE MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT US SAVINGS ARE AND THE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THOUGH COBOL NOT MONOXIDE. WE VOLUNTARILY YA DO SO. I STRONGLY URGE AND THE RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN OPPOSING SP YEAH ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I WANNA THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. OF PRESENTING THIS BILL AND ARE SENATE COLLEAGUE LOS ANGELES. OF MO FOR AUTHORING THE BILL I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF OF SP. ONE HUNDRED AND I THINK WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM OTHER COLLEAGUES OF HOW PRESSING THE ISSUE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS. WE KNOW WHAT THE SCIENCES THE SCIENCE A MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM DOES NOT CHANGE. LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN RECORDED HISTORY. NORTH OF GREENLAND. THE ARCTIC ICE OF FOOD THE ARCTIC ICE NORTH OF GREENLAND BROKE APART. THIS IS NOT JUST AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT AS TO WHAT COULD HAPPEN OR A THEORETICAL THREAT. THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY AND HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. AND THE DAMAGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DONE AS LONG AS WE REFUSE TO ACT. AND SO THERE ARE NO MORE TOMORROWS LEFT WE'VE ALREADY SET OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS ON A COURSE A DISASTROUS COURSE. THAT WE NOW MUST WORK. NO REALLY BIG ORIGINALLY TO CHANGE COURSE. AND AS YOU ONE HUNDRED IS BOLD BUT THE REALITY IS THAT. STILL AS YOU IN THE YEARS AHEAD OF IT STILL IS NOT GONNA BE SIMPLY ENOUGH WHAT IT DOES IS SETS EXPECTATION. IT'S AS THE MARKET EXPECTATIONS THAT ALLOWS FOR INVESTMENT TO MOVE US IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AND YES POLICIES WE ADOPT HERE DO HAVE IMPACTED DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ALL THE PAUSE WE DOT. HAVE IMPACTS ON CALIFORNIA'S BUT ALSO WHAT WE DON'T DO. HAS AN IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS AS WELL. SO WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO MOVE US IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. WE CANNOT IGNORE NOT JUST THE SCIENCE NUYS ECONOMIC VITALITY OF SP. ONE HUNDRED OTHER COUNTRIES ARE INVESTING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO CLEAN ENERGY. COMING FROM SILICON VALLEY I KNOW THAT SILICON VALLEY AND THE WHOLE STATE. AS EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY IN CLEAN ENERGY WE MUST GIVE THEM. THAT REASON TO INVEST WE MUST SET THE EXPECTATION SO THAT WE CAN MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND MOVE TOWARDS A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YES ON AS TO ONE HUNDRED AIMS KALRA MISTER DALLI YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I STAND IN OPPOSITION BUT I WANT I WANT TO TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT.

WE WENT 250% -- RENEWABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE THE TWENTY TWENTY GOALS WHICH WE HAVE MATT. BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN WE EXTENDED THE SOLAR CONTRACTS. AND THE TAX CREDITS FOR SOLAR IN THE STATE. THERE WAS TO MEMBERS WHO STOOD UP AND SAID WE DON'T NEED TO DO THIS YET. WE NEED TO WAIT IT WAS EVEN UP IT WAS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND EXTENDED A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT WEST HASBRO. LIKE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THEN SAID HEY. WE NEED WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN YOUR LOVE IT SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. WE ARE STE THE RATEPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED THE DUCK CURVE OF YOU SEE NOT DOCHARBOR WERE PRODUCING TOO MUCH ENERGY DURING THE DAY. AND NOT ENOUGH WHEN THE SUN ISN'T SHINING IN THE WIND'S NOT BLOWING. WE'RE GONNA ADD TO THAT IS HOW WE DO IT. THAT MATTERS. THE RATEPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PAYING A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR RIGHT NOW IN RATES. TO OFFSET THE COST GOING TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU PUT A ONE ELECTRON AND ONE COMES OUT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY YOU HAVE TO SEND IT SOMEWHERE AND WE'RE SENDING OUR ELECTRICITY. TO ARIZONA TO NEVADA TO OREGON AND WE'RE PAYING TO DO THAT AND IT'S DRIVING THE COSTA. MANY REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON THE ENERGY COMMITTEE I TALK ABOUT MY MOM'S PGD BILL. SHE IS LOOKING FOR NEW ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO AYE AND ACTUALLY SHE MOVED ARIZONA. SHE GIVES HIM THAT FREE ENERGY THAT WERE PAID FOR NOW IN ARIZONA. THIS IS POLICY IS NOT THE TIME IT'S NOT PUT WELL THOUGHT OUT. THE TIMING OF WHEN WE USE THOSE ELECTRONS AND I WILL GUARANTEE YOU WE PASSED THIS THAT THE RATES WILL GO UP AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE CLIMATE. THAT GOAL IS TO REDUCE CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE. WHAT GOT YOU THIS GO ON THE PORTICO LOOK THEIR SMOKE ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S FROM FOR SPIRE? THIS WILL DO NOTHING TO CURB THAT CARBON. WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE A MINUTE OF CARBON IN THE WORLD. SO MEMBERS I STE I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG TIME HASN'T BEEN WELL THOUGHT OUT DO I WANT TO GET THERE SOMEDAY I DO. BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME. CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD IT AND WE'RE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING AT THE BOTTOM AT THE SAME TIME I I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LAY OUT A PLAN THAT WE'RE NOT. PAYING OTHER STATES TO TAKE OUR LECTURES THE WE'RE NOT REALLY REALLY MIAMI HERE. WHERE IT'S A FEEL GOOD YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME TO SAY WE PASSED IT AND WE'RE LEADING? THE COST IS GOING TO DESTROY THE STATE. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME URGENT OBOE. SURE GLORIA YOU'RE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE THIS MORNING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE HUNDRED AS ONE OF ITS CO AUTHORS. APPRECIATION OF THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR INTRODUCING IT. OF MEMBERS ARE WE HAVE HEARD THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST -- THE OUR PS OF FOR OVER A DECADE. AND EACH OF THOSE ARGUMENTS OVER TIME HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIC PROVEN TO BE INCORRECT. THEY'LL SAY ON THE ONE HAND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND YET HERE WE ARE. CAN WE NOT ONLY MEETING THOSE GOALS BUT OFTEN EXCEEDING THEM AHEAD OF SCHEDULE THEY SAY THAT IT'LL RUIN OUR ECONOMY AND YET ALL OF US TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN HELPING TO LEAD THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD. WE KNOW THAT THIS COMMITMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT IS A PART OF WHAT SETS US APART AS THE GOLDEN STATE IT'S WHAT IS A PART OF OUR QUINTESSENTIAL BRAND AS CALIFORNIA WE STAND UP FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WE BELIEVE IN SCIENCE WE INVEST IN THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT S. B. ONE HUNDRED IS ABOUT AND WHAT HAVE WE GOT FOR WILL IS YOU'LL GET SIGNIFICANT DIVIDEND MEMBERS OF THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY IN THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE CLEANER AIR BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR CLIMATE POLICIES AS WELL AS A HALF A MILLION. GREEN IT GREEN CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND THAT IS THE GROW IT'S THE FASTEST GROWING PART OF OUR JOB MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA MEMBERS THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT. IT WAS THE CONSCIOUS DECISION OF OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO SET US ON THIS PATH AND NOW WE'RE BEING ASKED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD. BECAUSE EXACTLY THOSE FOLKS WHO SAID NO THAT WE COULD NOT DO WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG BECAUSE THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES HAVE NOT PROVEN TO BE TRUE. AND BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE OF DOING NOTHING IS SO ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. BUT EXCITED ABOUT THE NUMBERS I WANT TO TALK ONLY TO HEAR FROM MY OWN COMMUNITY WHEN I SERVED AS THE MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO I INTRODUCED THE CLIMAX A PLAN TO COMMIT SAN DIEGO TO MOVING THAT WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FAST FORWARD TO TODAY WORTH BY THREE OF THE FIVE CITIES IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT HAVE ALREADY MADE THIS COMMITMENT BY. CASTING THE STATE'S A LOT IN WITH THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THEY COULD WE CAN HELP THEM ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY COMMITTED THEMSELVES. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET SIGNAL THAT WE WILL SEND A TO FOLKS WHO ARE PINE NEARING THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS WORK. WE MUST PUT OURSELVES OUT THERE TO DO THIS BECAUSE AS WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE INACTION ARE ALL AROUND US IT JUST IN MY OWN DISTRICT OVER THE SUMMER WE'VE. MEASURED EIGHTY DEGREE WATER TEMPERATURE THE HIGHEST EVER RECORDED OFF THE COAST OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. THIS IS THE FACTS AS WE KNOW THEM. BUT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS HAVE NEVER BEEN PROVEN CORRECT. AND THE FAX AGAINST NOT DOING IT ARE SO VERY MUCH IN OUR FACE THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE. AND WE CANNOT FAIL TO ACT SO MEMBERS I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE THAT ARE ALREADY MAKING THIS GOAL FOR THEMSELVES. LET'S TAKE FIRM ACTION TO GROW OUR ECONOMY INTO STIMULATED FURTHER AND CREATE MORE JOBS HELP PEOPLE TO REDUCE THEIR ENERGY COSTS BY ALLOWING THEM TO GO TO SOLAR AND OTHER FORMS. OF INERT CLEAN ENERGY AND LASTLY LET'S DO IT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO UNDOUBTEDLY PAY THE PRICE OF THE CARBON ECONOMY THAT WE ARE TRYING. TO TO NOT LEAVE THEM LET'S MOVE IN ANOTHER DIRECTION WE MUST DO THIS TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU AS GLORIA. CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS A CO AUTHOR OF S. B. ONE HUNDRED AND THINK MY STATE SENATOR. FROM LOS ANGELES BURN IT INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRING IT UP TO THIS FLOOR. MY DISTRICT IS CRISSCROSSED BY SIX MAJOR FREEWAYS AND MAJOR TAILPIPE EMITTER SOME UGLY POLLUTION THAT OUR KIDS BREATHE. INTO THEIR LUNGS EVERY DAY FOR ALL OF YOU THAT LOVE TO GO TO A DODGER GAME. I ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO ON A RIDE ALONG WITH ME ON THE FIVE THE TEN THE ONE TEN THE FIXED THE THE ONE THIRTY FOUR OR THE TO FREEWAYS AND SEE HOW IT. CRISS CROSSES ALL OVER THE EIGHTY THE DISTRICT THE CARBON I THINK OUR GREATEST LOW HANGING FRUIT IT IS THE EASIEST THING THAT WE CAN DO. OUR STATE HAS ALREADY HARDNESS CLEAN ENERGY THROUGH GREEN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS HYDRO POWER WIND TURBINES AND SOLAR PANELING. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF ENERGY PRODUCTION WE NEED TO MAKE ARE CUTTING IT INNOVATION THE STANDARD THROUGH INCREASED USE OF NEW METHODS OF ENERGY PRODUCTION LIKE BIOMASS. AND GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY MEANS THE CLEANER AND BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR DUTY. TO ALL RESIDENTS TO ENSURE SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY. THAT IS USEFUL TO POWER OUR SCHOOLS ARE HOMES BUSINESSES AND SO MUCH MORE. I AM SURE THAT TOGETHER WE CAN HELP CREATE THOUSANDS OF HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO CLEAN ENTERED. THE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCTION OF 1100% CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE AREAS OF OUR STATE HIT HARDEST BY POLLUTION AND POOR HEALTH IS OFTEN. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. S. B.. ONE HUNDRED WILL MAKE GREAT STRIDES TO GUARANTEED THEM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THAT THEY DESERVE. OUR STATE HAVE ALREADY FAR SURPASSED THEIR PREVIOUS TARGETS FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE PREVENTION. WE ARE CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO DELIVER 50% OF ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE OR ZERO CARBON SOURCES BY. TWENTY TWENTY WELL I KNOW THAT TWENTY FORTY FIVE MAY SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME FROM NOW TIME GOES BY REALLY QUICKLY. SB ONE HUNDRED ESTABLISHES A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTED TO ACTING WITH URGENCY AND SPEED REQUIRE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CARBONIZED. ARE CONDAMINE OUR DRIVE TO SECURE A BRIGHTER SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE WILL HELP INSPIRE SIMILAR CHANGE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY ENOUGH CALIFORNIA GOES SO DOES THE NATION AS THE UNITED STATES GOES SO DOES THE WORLD WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. CREATE AMAZING CHANGE IN OUR STATE AND REALLY LEAD THE WAY SO I I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS GRILL MISTER THURMAN CURE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE HUNDRED PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR. AND I AM PROUD TO ADD MY VOICE -- IN -- UNISON WITH THOSE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL IS COMPLEX. BUT IT'S MESSAGES IS VERY SIMPLE. IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE SHOULD HELP TO CREATE A BETTER TOMORROW. IT SAYS THAT THE CLOCK IS TICKING. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE. NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A DECISION NOW ABOUT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO SLOW DOWN THAT CLOCK. TO PRESERVE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND FOR FUTURE. CALIFORNIANS AND IN MANY WAYS FOR OURSELVES. YES THERE IS PROBABLY SOME PRICE TO WHAT THIS MEASURE ASK. FOR BUT I'D ASK YOU THIS. WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU PUT? ON A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE. WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU PUT ON A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE THIS BILL SAYS? THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER [inaudible] TO PROVIDE. A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE ITS ASPIRATIONAL. IT IS SEEKING TO DO THE BEST. AND MAYBE WE WON'T GET THERE. IN THE YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN SET AS TARGETS MAYBE WE WON'T GET THERE AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX MAYBE WE'LL GET THERE BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHY NOT STRIVE FOUR WHAT IS THE BEST. WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING A DETERIORATION IN OUR ENVIRONMENT? WELL WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THE MELTING OF THE SNOW PACK WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN. CHALLENGES AND OUR AIR QUALITY MORE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE FACING. SEA LEVEL RISE AND OTHER CHALLENGES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. MY TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SAYS THAT SHE'S A SCIENTISTS. AND SHE OTHER ANYTHING IN RESEARCH. OR ANY PUBLICATIONS BUT EVEN SHE KNOWS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. IF REST TO THE NOT SCIENCE AND WHAT'S BEFORE US. IS REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE IN IF YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST. NOT SO MY DAUGHTER IF YOU GONNA BE A SCIENTIST IS TO RULES CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR EXPERIMENTS AND DON'T BLOW UP OUR HOUSE. BUT SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. FOR HERSELF AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY SCIENTIFIC THEORY YOU KNOW COMMON SENSE AS YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S GETTING HOTTER. THE TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN MORE EXTREME THAN WE'VE EVER EVER SEEN. WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL? WE STARTED A CONSTRUCTION JOB TRAINING PROGRAM THAT FEATURED SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION. AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR BUILDING TRADES IN OUR LOCAL COMPANIES TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO OUR CONSUMERS. AND IT BECAME THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR US THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOALS WE CAN PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND PROMOTE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY AROUND. RENEWABLE ENERGY AROUND NEW PATENTS WERE NEW FORMS OF CLEAN ENERGY AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD NOT JUST THE NATION BUT THE WORLD WITH THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE. AND WE DON'T GET THERE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE CAN ALWAYS DEVISE THIS BUT I ASK YOU AGAIN WHAT'S THE PRICE YOU WOULD PUT. ON A GREAT QUALITY OF LIFE I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PROVIDE THAT FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. AND TO HAVE A QUALITY OF LIFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BE. ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU MS THURMAN DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER. SO I HEAR A NUMBER. OF CONCERNS HERE. BUT I DON'T HEAR ANYONE DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THAT'S PROGRESS. ONE OF THE ONE THING THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BY PARTICULARLY THE MEMBER FROM BEAVER ARE REPUBLICAN LEADER. WHAT'S THE CONCERN ABOUT FIRES. AND THAT IS IN IN THIS BILL. BUT I GUESS. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE LEADER WITH THE MEMBER FOR BEAVER AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. DO SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE AND BRING BACK THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS SO WE HAVE A PLACE TO PUT. THE DEBRIS FROM THE FOREST THAT WERE THINNING. SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT THAT'S WITH THIS WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. THE OTHER THING I HEAR ABOUT IS IS THIS REALLY FEASIBLE. I I AM A SCIENTIST AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH HARDER TO GO FROM 33%. TO SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED BUT THIS BILL AND I WOULDN'T SUPPORT IT IF IT WEREN'T IN HERE SPECIFICALLY SAT. THAT THE COMMISSION SHALL MAINTAIN AND PROTECT THE SAFETY RELIABLE OPERATION AND BALLOTS YOU NEED THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN OFF RAMP IF WE CAN'T HAVE RELIABLE ELECTRICITY WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE CAN OR NOT. BUT THIS IS A WAY TO GET US TO TRY. SO THAT'S IN THEIR IN IF IT WEREN'T IN THERE I WOULD BE SUPPORTING IT. THE SECOND THING. THAT'S IN THERE IS COST CONTAINMENT. AND AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T IN THERE I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING IT. BUT IT'S IN THERE. AND PARTICULARLY IT SAYS THE COMMISSION WILL LOOK AT EACH ELECTRICAL OUR UTILITY. AND IT WILL DETERMINE THAT THERE SHALL NOT BE DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASES [inaudible] IN [inaudible] OUR COST [inaudible] FURTHER IT TALKS ABOUT THE MINIMALIST CHANGES IN COST LATER ON AND AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T IN THERE I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE. SO THIS IS PROTECTING OUR ELECTRICAL GRID THIS IS PROTECTING [inaudible] ARE CONSUMERS [inaudible] AND FURTHER. WE ARE JUST SEEN SO MANY IMPACTS CLIMATE. THAT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS IN THE SEVENTIES THAT WE NOT. WE JUST DIDN'T ANTICIPATE. THE MEMBER FROM GLENDALE VERY ACCURATELY SHED WE HAD NO IDEA HOW FAST THINGS WOULD CHANGE AND WE HAD NO IDEA. THAT YOU COULD GET FIRE TORNADOES. AND WHY ARE WE GETTING THESE. IT'S VERY SUBTLE. BUT WHAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH FIRE [inaudible] IS THAT. WHEN YOU GET GREENHOUSE WARMING? WHEN YOU GET WARMING FROM GREENHOUSE GASES? IF PREFERENTIALLY KEEPS THE TEMPERATURES UP AT NIGHT MORE THAN THE DAY. WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE NOT GETTING A COOLER NIGHT WHEN YOU GET PATRICIA WHEN YOU GET ARE DO. AND YOU GET SOME WETNESS AND THE FIREFIGHTERS USED TO SAY LOW THE FIRES GO TO BED AT NIGHT THEY DON'T ANYMORE. AND THAT'S WHY WE SEATS UP THAT SUCH TERRIBLE -- DAMAGE AROUND READING AND AROUND OTHER PARTS OF OUR OF OUR GREAT STATE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS IS NOT THE NEW NORMAL IT'S JUST GONNA GET WORSE. SO WE HAVE TO BE A LEADER WE HAVE TO SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE IF WE CAN GET TO A 100% RENEWABLES OTHERS WELL IT'S WELL. PLEASE SUPPORT SB. ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK [inaudible] MS RACE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. ONE HUNDRED AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSE PRICES BUT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS WELL. THAT'S WHY BROAD COALITION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS ARE YOU URGING THE PASSAGE OF SB. ONE HUNDRED PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON A PATH 21100% CLEAN ENERGY IS PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO SUBSTANTIALLY. CLEANER AIR FUTURE. THAT'S WHY THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA STRONGLY SUPPORTS SP. ONE HUNDRED CARVING A PATH TO A CLEAN ENERGY GRANT WILL LEAD TO CLEANER AIR AND HEALTHIER LONGS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT NOW OUR LUNGS ARE BEING THREATENED BY AIR POLLUTION. ACCORDING TO THE LUNG ASSOCIATION STATE OF THE AIR OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT. CALIFORNIA HAS THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF BEING HOME TO THE MAJORITY THE TOP TEN U. S. CITIES THE WORST. OZONE AND PARTICLE POLLUTION. CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE RISKS FROM POLLUTION MADE WORSE BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THEIR LUNGS AND THEIR BODIES DEFENSES ARE STILL DEVELOPING. AND THEY BREED MORE AIR PER POUND THAN ADULTS. FOR MANY SENIORS ARE POLLUTION CAN BE DEADLY. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS AN ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IMPACT ON LOW IMPACT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THESE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH THREATS BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR WORK. INCLUDING YOUR PLACES THAT HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF POLLUTION OR BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING MEDICAL CARE. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE ASTHMA AND FACE GREATER CHALLENGES COPING WITH EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. THE REALITY IS CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. TO MEET THE CHALLENGE AND PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH A HEALTHIER FUTURE WE MUST TRANSFORM THE WAY WE PRODUCE AND CONSUME ENERGY. AFTER YEARS OF INCREASING OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY [inaudible] TARGETS. IT'S TIME TO THINK BIG AND PUT OUR GREAT STATE ON A PATH TO ONE HUNDRED CAN PERCENT CLEAN ENERGY. FOR OUR CHILDREN WHEN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. HE WAS RESIDENTS HER OBERNOLTE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER I DON'T THINK A SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS BODY WOULD DISAGREE. WITH THE NEED TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK A SINGLE MEMBER WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE CONCERN THAT A LOT OF US ARE RAISING. IS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A CREDIBLE PLAN FOR GETTING US FROM WHERE WE ARE. TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE. WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN. THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND THE COST OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR STATE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BULL THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO DOING THAT. BUT LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET US 2100% RENEWABLES. WE ALREADY OVER GENERATE FROM RENEWABLES DURING THE DAY. AND WE UNDER GENERATE AT NIGHT GETTING 21100% WOULD REQUIRE US TO ADD AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT. OF ENERGY STORAGE AND WE HIT RIGHT NOW HAVE NO PLAN ON HOW TO DO THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT. DON'T WE OWE IT TO CALIFORNIANS TO AT LEAST HAVE THOUGHT OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. BEFORE WE WRITE THIS RULE IN STONE THERE WERE TO GET 2100%. BUT I HAVE AN EVEN BIGGER CONCERN. WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND MY CONCERN INVOLVES A TOPIC THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY NUMBER OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IN THIS DEBATE AND THAT'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANDATES THAT WE PASS IN THIS CHAMBER DO NOT FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE PORTION OF OUR STATE THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT [inaudible] AND UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE THINGS WE DO IN THIS CHAMBER DO THAT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE OF ANY STATE. IN THE COUNTRY AND ACCORDING TO US CENSUS BUREAU THE REASON FOR THAT POVERTY PREDOMINANTLY IS THE HIGH COST OF LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW IT'S BEEN ASSERTED. BY THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL THAT PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUS INCREASES IN THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. HAVE NOT RESULTED IN THE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE DETRACTORS SAID I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THAT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY OUR CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WHEN WE RAISE THIS PORTFOLIO STANDARD THE PAST. IS THAT ELECTRICITY RATES WOULD GO UP AND THEY HAVE. NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW. THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IN CALIFORNIA PAYS 40% MORE FOR ELECTRICITY THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND FOR INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICITY IT'S ALMOST 80% MORE. THOSE COSTS ARE BORNE. BY THE PAY MORE IN OUR STATE AND EVERY TIME WE ADOPT ANOTHER MANDATE ANOTHER REGULATION THAT RAISES THE COST OF LIVING HERE. INEVITABLY WE DRIVE A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF OUR POPULATION IN A POVERTY. I WOULD SUPPORT. THE BALANCE PROPOSAL THAT HAVE A CREDIBLE PLAN FOR GETTING US COSTS ON TO CONSUMERS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISS WALDRON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A A A LOT OF FOR I THINK -- MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN THIS STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THANK YOU ARE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT THINKING WE'RE DOING THINGS THAT ARE GONNA HAVE AN IMPACT BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT JUST LOOK AT THE FIRES WE'VE DONE MORE EMISSIONS INTO THE AIR. THIS YEAR WITH A MILLION PLUS ACRES BURNED. THROUGH POLICIES THAT YOU KNOW IN AN EFFORT TO TRY. TO HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY HEARD OF WORSE -- ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY RATES ARE JUST GONNA GO UP WITH THIS LEGISLATION ONCE AGAIN -- I'M A BUSINESSOWNER I HAVE A MANUFACTURING RETAIL BUSINESS ALREADY PAY SUPER HIGH RATES THE GET HAVE TO BE PASSED ON TO MY CUSTOMERS IN MY PRODUCT -- CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ALREADY PAY AMONG THE HIGHEST PER KILOWATT HOUR RATES FOR ENERGY IN THE NATION. AS OF APRIL LAST YEAR OF INDUSTRIAL RATE PAYERS PAY A PREMIUM OF 68% FOR ELECTRICITY AND 73% FOR NATURAL GAS. OVER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THAT'S OVER IN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. BUSINESSES FARMING FOOD PROCESSING CUSTOMERS PAY A SIMILAR PREMIUM WHICH IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO BE COMPETITIVE. IN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ADDITIONAL MANDATE WITH ANOTHER GOAL ON TOP OF ANOTHER GOAL COMPLICATES AND INCREASES COST RATEPAYERS AND ALL CLASSES AND GUESS WHAT. IT'S ARE HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING TO PAY ONCE AGAIN SO I URGE A NO VOTE. THEY WAS WATER MISTER BRO THERE RECOGNIZE. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- I RISE IN OPPOSITION BUT I WANNA GO BACK AND LOOK AT A LITTLE HISTORY HERE SO I THINK UP. IF YOU BACK TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES A LOT A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES CAME UP WHERE. WE LET TREES DIE NATURALLY -- IN DECAY IN THE FOREST WE RAN THE LOGGERS OUT OF CALIFORNIA THAT USE TO OPEN UP THESE FIREBREAKS FOR US. AND IN THE MID NINETIES PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS -- ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FOR LETTING A FIRE BURNING YELLOWSTONE. BUT I AFTER THAT FIRE FIVE YEARS LATER HE WAS PROVEN CORRECT WITH THE SOOT. AND THE FUEL IN THERE. PRODUCED A NEW ROUND OF SAPLING. AND I WOULD -- I WOULD SAY THAT THE FIRES AND EVERYTHING WERE HAVING RIGHT NOW IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE FAILED POLICIES FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES. WE CAN HAVE THE BEST. POLICY WE HAD AB THIRTY TWO WE'VE INCREASED WE WANT TO INCREASE AGAIN WE CAN HAVE THE PERFECT [inaudible] POLICY. BUT UNTIL WE GET OUR FORESTS HEALTHY. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK BECAUSE THAT FOREST IS WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE THE GASES. OUT OF THE AIR. SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS FIRE -- LEGISLATION GOING TO REALLY CHANGE THE POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT IN OUR FORESTS. BUT THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY WE'VE GOT AS WAS SAID TO MUCH ELECTRICITY -- WE HAVE VERY LITTLE STORAGE WE NEED TO INVEST IN STORAGE WE NEED TO INVEST IN BIOMASS. I HAD A NUCLEAR PLANTS SANTA NOW FOR CLOSE A DIABLO CANYON CLOSING THE TWENTY TWENTY SIX CLEAN NUCLEAR IS GOING TO BE GONE FROM CALIFORNIA WE NEED THAT. NOT RELIANT JUST SOLAR AND WIND AND THE COOL KIDS THEY GET THE SUBSIDIES BUT WE REALLY NEED TO INVEST IN BIOMASS IN SOME OF THESE OTHER ENERGIES TO HELP US OUT. AND ONE FACT IT. YOU CANNOT DISPUTE IS THAT THIS DOES INCREASE COST THIS ENTIRE MONTH I'D BE GETTING CALLS IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE. FROM RAT RESIDENTS IN THE SEVENTY THIRD DISTRICT -- PARTICULARLY PLACES LIKE LADERA RANCH WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH ELECTRIC BILLS. SO THE COST YOU CANNOT DISPUTE. THAT THIS IS GONNA BE PASSED ON TO THE RATE PAYERS -- IN CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER THING WE TALK ABOUT BEING THE WORLD'S LEADER. WELL WE ARE THE WORLD LEADER BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS DOING ANYTHING CHINA INDIA THESE OTHER MATTERS. ARE THE WILD WILD WEST WHILE WE PENALIZE OUR OWN COMPANIES WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. SO CHINA AND INDIA CAN MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS IN GOODS AND SERVICES AND SELLING CHEAPER THAN OUR CALIFORNIA AND U. S. COMPANIES. AND I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS SHOULD FOOT THE BILL FOR THE REST OF WORLD SO LAST FOR NO VOTE. DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE I'M I RISE TO SUPPORT SB. ONE HUNDRED BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME SOME THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN POINT OUT BY A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE TODAY -- IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE WE HAVE BIOMASS WHICH I KNOW TO SOME PEOPLE IS A IS A PROBLEM. WE HAVE AYE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY WHICH DOESN'T GET ENJOYED SOME THE SUBSIDIES THAT THAT WE SEE WITH WIND AND SOLAR. BUT THOSE TWO ENERGY SOURCES PROVIDE BASELINE ENERGY THEY DON'T REQUIRED SUN THEY DON'T REQUIRE THE WIND AND THEY'RE THERE ALL THE TIME. ANY OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I ALSO HAVE REPRESENT A COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UP A PUBLIC UTILITY THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AUTHORITY AND POWER AGENCY. AND THEY HAVE. LARGE LARGE GEOTHERMAL I'M NOT I MEAN EXCUSE ME LARGE A LARGE HYDRO. THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNTED. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT BOAT SAILED ALONG TIME AGO -- BUT AS A AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SITTING HEALDSBURG IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT OUR LARGE HYDRO. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT US IN THE PROBABLY 64% RENEWABLE -- AND THAT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SO THAT THAT THAT SALE BY GET IT AND AND WORK AND I'M I CAN LIVE WITH THAT -- I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I EXPERIENCED THAT POOR AIR QUALITY OF AIR POLLUTION IN PART TAILPIPE EMISSIONS AND I I GET THAT. I MOVED OUT OF THEIR TO THE CLEAN AIR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHY CLEAN AIR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY AWFUL? WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN SMOKE FOR THE LAST THIRTY PLUS DAYS. A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND ACRE FOREST FIRE STARTED IN MY DISTRICT. AS 50% LARGER THAN THE LARGEST FOREST FIRE ON HISTORY WHICH HAPPENED LAST YEAR. IN THE IN THE MEMBER FROM SANTA BARBARA'S DISTRICT. WE HAVE TO CREATE A BALANCE IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND SO LATER THIS WEEK YOU'RE GONNA GET A CHANCE. TO HELP US. SPEND POTENTIALLY PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED WHAT WE SPEND ON A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. TO HELP IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH AND AND AND OUR OUR LAND MANAGEMENT PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. SO I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS AND I BELIEVE A 100% IN THE MISSION HERE. BUT I HOPE AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT THIS HOUSE RECOGNIZES THAT THE POOR AIR QUALITY PROBABLY THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE HISTORY OF MY DISTRICT. AND THE MINORITY LEADERS DISTRICT. WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCE. FOR A MONTH. SO SOME CONSIDERATION THE FUTURE ABOUT HOW WE GO FORWARD -- WOULD BE APPRECIATED WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A BALANCE HERE FOR GOING TO ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO THAT'S REDUCE CARBON OUTPUT. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND AYE AYES AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE TODAY. BUT I ASK FOR YOU TO REALLY CONSIDER GOING FORWARD THAT WE SEE. INVEST IN THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HELP REALLY OFFSET CARBON IN THE STATE AND THAT'S REDUCING FIRES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOOD MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW AYE WANT. TO THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ESPECIALLY ALL OF THE COMMENTS FROM OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE ENERGY COSTS THAT CALIFORNIANS A PAY ARE PAYING OUR MANUFACTURERS. I ALSO WANT ACKNOWLEDGES ALL THE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE RAGING FIRES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DESPERATE NEED. THE DOUBLE DOWN ON FORCE MANAGEMENT. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE BIPARTISAN CONCERNS. I'M JUST AS CONCERNED AS ANYONE ABOUT. KEEPING OUR ENERGY COSTS UNDER CONTROL I'M JUST AS CONCERNED ABOUT ANYONE ABOUT ADDRESSING THESE RACING CALIFORNIA FIRES. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN MY DISTRICT [inaudible] BUT I STAND PROUDLY TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL S. B.. ONE HUNDRED AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. WE HAVE [inaudible] TO TRUST [inaudible] SCIENCE. WE HAVE TO TRUST THE FACTS. OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD. AGREE THAT WE ARE FACING A GLOBAL CRISIS MAN MADE CLIMATE CHANGE. AND MANY OF THOSE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THAT WE HAVE. PERHAPS ALREADY PASSED THE TIPPING POINT. FROM WHAT'S THERE IS NO RETURN. THE TIPPING POINT [inaudible] WHEN OUR? STILL CAPS ARE MELTING. SEE LEVELS RISING [inaudible] CLIMB MEN. I COMING MORE AND MORE EXTREME. AND WE'RE SEEING THAT RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE HAVE OR EXTENDED DROUGHTS WHEN WE HAVE? HOTTEST SUMMERS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED FIVE OF THE SEVEN HOTTEST SUMMERS AND RECORDED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING HERE AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SO. THIS BILL I BELIEVE IS ONE OF THOSE LANDMARK BILLS. WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY WHERE ARE MY DAUGHTER AND YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO SAY? WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHAT DID YOU DO TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT DID YOU DO? A FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE I BELIEVE. IF NOT NOW WHEN WE NEED TO SUPPORT. SP. ONE HUNDRED FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS FOR OUR PLANET. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A LARGE. PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE THAT IS THAT YOU ALL ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE IS A AS A LEGISLATURE. WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE CHANGE A LARGE PIECE OF SOLVING THAT IS -- RENEWABLE ENERGY INVOLVING. WIND TURBINES RIGHT ENERGY FROM THE WIND OKAY. SO WHILE EVERYONE ELSE HAS TALKED ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF THIS ISSUE I WANNA SWITCH GEARS A LIMIT JUST TALK ABOUT HOW THIS KIND OF POLICY AFFECTS THE LIVES OF YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. WIND TURBINES DEPEND TO BE MADE THEY DEPEND ON RARE EARTH MATERIALS BATTERED MIND IN CHINA THESE WHEN TURBINES ARE MIND IN CHINA. THE PROCESS OF EXTRACTING THESE MATERIALS OPPOSES WRETCHED ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THERE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WENT THERE TO SEE TO LOOK AT THESE MINES IN THESE FACTORS NEED DUMPING GROUNDS ASSOCIATED. WITH THEIR RARE EARTH INDUSTRY. AND HIS COMMENTS WERE THE BANKS GREW HIGHER THE LAKE GREW LARGER AND THE STENCH IN FUMES GREW MORE OVERWHELMING [inaudible] WITH THE WEEPS THE PLANTS WE PLANTED JUST WEATHERED. AND THEN THE ANIMALS STARTED TO SICKEN AND DIE PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO SUFFER. VILLAGERS SAY THEIR TEETH BEGAN TO FALL OUT THEIR HAIR TURNED WHITE AT A YOUNG AGE AND THEY SUFFERED FROM SEVERE SKIN AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES CHILDREN WERE BORN WITH SOFT BONES IN CANCER RATES SKYROCKETED. AND OFFICIALS CARRIED STUDIES OUT FIVE YEARS AGO IN ONE OF THE VILLAGES WHERE THEY'RE UNUSUALLY HIGH RATES OF CANCER ALONG WITH HIGH RATES OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND SKINNER RESPIRATORY DISEASE THIS IS THE LAKES RADIATION LEVELS WERE TEN TIMES HIGHER. THAN IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRYSIDE. SO I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT. THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING TO MAKE. THE EFFECT THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE ON FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. BECAUSE AS THIS. PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTALISTS STATED THERE IS NOT ONE STEP A RARE EARTH MINING PROCESS THAT IS NOT DISASTROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO I HEARD A LOT OF TALK TODAY ALSO ABOUT DOING THIS FOR THE CHILDREN IN DOING THIS FOR CONSTITUENTS IN TAKING CARE THE ENVIRONMENT AND MAKING SURE. WE CAN ANSWER WHEN SOMEONE ASKS WHAT DID WE DO TO SAVE THE PLANET [inaudible] YOU ARE. BY ENGAGING IN THIS PROPPING UP. A CORRUPT AND BRUTAL GOVERNMENT IN CHINA. THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES THERE IT'S THE LIST IS VERY LONG. THEY JAIL PRO DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS THEY FORCED GAY MEN TO GO TO UNDERGO CONVERSION THERAPY AGAINST THEIR WILL THERE IS JUST A CASE LAST YEAR INVOLVING THIS. THEY SPEAK AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT IF YOU SPEAK AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT YOU GET JAIL GONZALEZ OR AT YOUR WRITINGS AYE AYE I'M AND HAS ALSO PUT YOUR SPEECH POINT WHERE I WOULD ASK -- THE SPEAKER TO KEEP TO THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS. THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER THAT POINT ORDERS WILL TAKE ADMISSIBLE AND AS I UNDERSTAND THE LINK AT YOUR MAKING CHINA BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE POLICY MATTER BEFORE THIS WELL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I IMPOSE FOCUSING ON THE POLICY BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL. CONTEMPLATES THE FX. ON THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE REDUCE SOMETHING OR YOU DON'T AND I AM POINTING OUT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT IF WE DO THIS. IF YOU SPEAK AGAINST A GOVERNMENT IN CHINA YOU GET JAILED. IN MARCH AN ARTIST WAS SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN PRISON IN CONNECTION WITH HIS EFFORTS TO COMMEMORATE THE TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE. YOU GET SAME LETTERS AS WELL AS I AM RULED ON THE MATTER LET'S FOCUS ON THE BILL. IN FRONT OF THE BODY. IT THEN. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I WOULD LIKE TO APPEAL THAT RULING. THAT TAKES A SECOND US MELENDEZ ON MAY APPEAL THE RULING THAT'S SECONDED BY MISTER MATHIS. S. IS APPEALING DECISION OF THE CHAIR ON MY RULING -- IN THIS CASE MISS MELENDEZ IS MOVING AND MR MATHIS SECONDS THE ON THE APPEAL OF THE DECISION OF THE CHAIR THE QUESTION BEFORE THE BODY IS SHALL THE DECISION OF THE CHAIR. BE OVERRULED SELF SHALL THE DECISION OF THE CHAIR. LOBBY OVER RULED IN THIS CASE MS MELENDEZ IS ASKING FOR DIVERT A MISTER CALDERON IS ASKING FOR A KNOW THEM. AND MS MELENDEZ YOU GET TWO MINUTES 2% ON THE APPEAL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. YOU KNOW IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT -- WHENEVER WE START TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE SENSITIVE. SUDDENLY PEOPLE STAND UP AND DECIDE THAT THAT'S NOT GERMANE TO THE TOPIC WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT OUR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS THAT WITH THIS BILL WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET IN SAVING. THE LIVES OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS FROM AND FUTURE GENERATIONS FROM THE DAMAGES CAUSED TO THE ENVIRONMENT BY POLICIES PUT IN PLACE. SO I AM SPEAKING DIRECTLY MAYBE I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS DOES HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON HUMAN LIVES WHETHER THEY'RE HERE OR IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY I AM POINTING OUT SOME OF THESE ABUSES. AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE LIVES YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON BY PASSING THIS BILL. BECAUSE OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THESE CHAMBERS WE HEAR TALK ABOUT WE WE'VE HAD BILLS ABOUT CONVERSION THERAPY WE'VE HAD BILLS ABOUT PRO DEMOCRACY WE'VE HAD BILLS. ABOUT THAT THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE SUPPOSEDLY HOLD NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEARTS IN CALIFORNIA WORK TO PROTECT. WITH THIS BILL. IN THESE EFFORTS WE'RE TAKING THAT AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE. THAT IS MY POINT WITH THIS THAT I MEAN YOU CAN'T SAY YOU CARE ABOUT EVERYBODY YOU CARE ABOUT ALL THESE RATES IF IT'S ONLY THE PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD ARE THE YOU CARE ABOUT HUMANITY OR YOU DON'T. SO IT IS GERMANE TO THE TOPIC AND WITH THAT MISTER SPEAKER. I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON MY APPEAL OF THE RULING OF THE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISS MELENDEZ AND I PROVIDED MY REASONING. FOR THE RULING THAT DECISION OF THE APP. QUESTION FOR THE BODY SHELL THE DECISION OF THE CHAIR BE OVERRULED MISS MELENDEZ IS ASKING FOR NINE MISTER CALDERON IS ASKING FOR NOW THIS. REQUIRES A MAJORITY PRESENT VOTING CLERK WILL OVER THE ROLL-ON. MISTER CALDERON IS ASKING FOR A NO VOTE. AND MS MELENDEZ IS ASKING FOR AN I.. THIS IS A PROCEDURAL VOTE THIS IS APPEALING THE DECISION OF THE CHAIR. REQUIRES A MAJORITY PRESENT AND VOTING. MISS MELENDEZ IS ASKING FOR AN I. AND MISTER CALDERON IT'S ASKING FOR NO [inaudible] CLERK WILL. CLOSE ROLL EYES EIGHTEEN KNOWS RULING IS UPHELD [inaudible] AND MS MELENDEZ. THIS MIGHT AS HAVE A MINUTE FIFTY TWO ON THERE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SO. COLLEAGUES LECH. THIS BILL WE'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL OF THE ECONOMICS I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO POINT OUT THE AFFECTED GOING TO HAVE ON HUMAN BEINGS WHETHER NOT THEY'RE HERE IN CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE AN EFFECT ON THOSE HUMAN BEINGS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THEIR OF OTHER MEMBERS WHO POINTED OUT THAT THIS. THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO ANYMORE AND I AM SUGGESTING IN ADDITION. TO ALL OF THE ECONOMICS BEHIND THIS. NO ONE IS DENYING THE SCIENCE BY THE WAY. THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE EFFECT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE ON HUMAN LIVES NOT JUST IN THIS STATE. BUT IN THIS WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVE PARTNERSHIPS CALIFORNIA'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES SO CLEARLY IT WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND AND IN TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SO IF IT'S NOT IMPORTANT WE DO THIS ON THE GLOBAL SCALE WHILE WHY THEN WOULD YOU IGNORE. THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU TODAY. ABOUT THE EFFECT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER HUMAN BEINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD THAT TO ME JUST MAKES NO SENSE EITHER YOU ARE FOR HUMAN BEINGS ARE YOU ARE GETS EASIER FOR GAY RIGHTS BE AGAINST YOUR FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. OR YOU'RE AGAINST YOUR FOR DEMOCRACY ARE YOU AGAIN SHE CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU MS MELENDEZ MISTER GARCIA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I'VE BEEN ENLIGHTENED THAT THIS. AFTERNOON BY THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD ON ONE AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS? TO BE CONCERNED WITH CHINA AND THEIR PRACTICES. AND I'M FULLY CONFIDENT THAT OUR PRESIDENT WILL TAKE CARE OF THOSE PROBLEMS. I'VE ALSO HEARD IN WELCOME NOW NEW ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES ON THIS FLOOR AND I'M EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO WORK -- ACROSS THE AISLE ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES I'VE ALSO HEARD. THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DUCK CURVE BY OUR MINORITY LEADER AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY PRIOR TO OF FINISHING UP THIS SESSION. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. ONE HUNDRED I REPRESENT A COUNTY. THAT HISTORICALLY HAS SUFFERED FROM CHRONICLE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES UP TO TWENTY EIGHT PERCENTILE AT TIMES AND ON A GOOD DAY SOMEWHERE WITHIN FOURTEEN OR 15%. AND IT'S BEEN THE INCREASING OF THE RP ASSN THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE GONE. TOWARDS THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY PUT US IN A BETTER SPOT NOT IN A GREAT SPOT BUT IN A BETTER SPOT. AND SO HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO STIMULATE. AN ECONOMY OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE MINDFUL AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN DIVERSIFY THE PORTFOLIO. A BALANCED RELIABLE GREAT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW US NOT ONLY. TO ADDRESS THE OVER GENERATION ISSUES BUT ALSO CREATE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN PLACES OF ECONOMIC NEEDS. WHETHER YOU'RE IN LAKE COUNTY OR IN IMPAIR OAK COUNTY. OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CREATE NOT ONLY THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT. DEBATE SHOULD BE ABOUT. I THINK THAT WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THIS ISSUE OF THE DUCK CURVE THE OVER GENERATION BY INTRODUCING. OTHER RENEWAL BALLS THAT ARE BASED LOW FLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE. AND YOU KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FIRES HAS FORCED US TO GET TO A PLACE IN WHICH BIOMASS IS A CONVERSATION THAT'S TAKING PLACE. FOR MANY IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE BUT FOR SOME OF US IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE NOT JUST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE FIRES. BUT THE ISSUE OF JOBS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE. SOME OF THE SOLAR WIND OPPORTUNITIES PRIOR TO THE TAX CREDIT. ASPIRING AND YES MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO EMPLOY PEOPLE IN THOSE SECTORS. BUT I THINK THAT BY INCREASING THE RP YES THAT'S HOW WE BRING ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD SAY WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL. HOW WE MOVE FORWARD HE SAYS THE WORD INTENTIONALITY? WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL WITH OUR POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. DIVERSE SYFY THE PORTFOLIO AND WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT ARENA OF THE EFFORTS TO FIND THE PORTFOLIO AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA. BENEFITS FROM MY CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES IT IS ABOUT EQUITY. IT IS ABOUT DIVERSIFYING THE PORTFOLIO BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT PEOPLE AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT EVERYONE HERE HAS MENTIONED THAT WE MUST LOOK OUT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES HERE AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE? AIMS GARCIA MISTER IS AREA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- I WAS GONNA GET UP AND TALK ABOUT AN ASPECT THAT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED NO ONE BROUGHT UP ESPECIALLY. FROM MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM COACHELLA VALLEY JUST THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. TWO HOW EXACTLY IT IMPACTS HIS DISTRICT. COLLEAGUES I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK LITTLE SUMMATION OF THE THINGS THAT I LOOK AT IN MY OWN DISTRICT AND EVERYWHERE ELSE I GO. WE'RE USING TECHNOLOGIES FROM OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN WE'RE STILL USING. HOLES ON OUR STREETS TO CARRY TO TRANSMIT ELECTRICITY. AND EVERY GENERATION OR OTHER GENERATION EXPANDS AND BUILDS UPON THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. NOT ONLY TO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. BUT TO ALSO ALLOW FOR JOB CREATION. WHEN YOU SET GOALS INTO THE FUTURE YOUR GIVING ENOUGH OF A SPACE? FOR MORE TECHNOLOGY FOR MORE ENHANCEMENT FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES. A TO BE MET IN THAT TIME LIFE. AND WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL MORE BECAUSE OF THOSE TARGETS. YET THAT'S NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT. WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING HOW MANY MORE JOBS IT WILL BE CREATED BECAUSE OF THIS. AND NOT JUST THE JOBS OF INNOVATION BUT THEN THE JOBS THEREAFTER IN MAINTENANCE. SO WITH THAT I HUMBLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND MAYBE TO SOME EXTENT. WE ALSO ARE NOT EVEN GOING FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE TIMELINE OF TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. I'M SURE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR HOW THE INDUSTRY IS GONNA CHANGE BUT MAY NOT EVEN BE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE. COMING UP IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THAT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY EVEN. ADVANCE THE ABILITY. TO GET TO A PERIOD OF TIME. THANK YOU MISTER. MR CHAVEZ YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SPEAKER. LOOKING A DISCUSSION. JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY A COUPLE POINTS BRING IDEAS AND I THINK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOS ANGELES IN THEIR TRAFFIC OR CONFUSING TRANSPORTATION. WITH THE GREAT SYSTEM. I WE HAD THAT PROBLEM LAST YEAR AND THE DISCUSSION AND CAP AND TRADE THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. ISSUE ABOUT CHANGING OUR ENERGY POLICIES IN THIS NOT HAVING AN IMPACT. IT CLEARLY IS HAVING AN IMPACT JUST GO TALK TO ANY MANUFACTURING COMPANY. AND ASK THEM HOW THEIR ENERGY COST IS AND HOW THEY COMPARE IT. THAT'S THERE ARE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION I'LL SHOW YOU ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CALIFORNIA TO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO A GENTLEMAN SAYING WHAT HE REALLY FEARS IS THAT THE PEOPLE THESE PAN USE TRIES GIMMICK GOOD WAGE TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. BUT HE KNOWS THE ENERGY COSTS THEIR PAIN IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER YOU SAYS I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE MAKING IT ON THESE WAGES. SO THERE IS AN ENERGY COST TO THE WORKING POOR. AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ONE THE BIG DISCUSSION RARELY TALKED ABOUT AS REGIONALIZATION OF THE WESTERN GRID HOUSE GOING IMPACT. CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND SO THAT YOU NEED TO THROW THAT IN THERE. AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU JUST LIKE I DO LIKE TO LISTEN TO A PODCAST THIS WEEK GOD FEEDS A CARI. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT FUSION INTERNATIONAL EXPERIMENT GOING IN EUROPE WERE ACTUALLY UNITED STATES PARTICIPATING. AND LOOKING AT FUSION ENERGY TO SOLVE THE ENERGY PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD IN THE LOOKING AT DOING THAT WITHIN A DECADE. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE A WHOLE DISCUSSION. BUT LET'S GO TO THIS ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. IT'S NICE TO SEE THERE WAS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE UP FIVE YEARS AGO AS A REPUBLICAN STANDING UP SAYING I BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE. EVERYBODY START THROWING THINGS AT ME NOW EVERYBODY'S ONBOARD A REPUBLICAN APPRECIATE THAT THE BUT REALITY IS CALIFORNIA'S ONLY 1% OF THE CARBON OUTPUT IN THE WILL AND THE IN THE WORLD. AND SO WHEN I WAS TALKING TO GOVERNOR BROWN WE'RE GOING CAP AND TRADE I SAID WHAT IS THE REAL ROLE OF CALIFORNIAN THIS IN A REAL ROLLER CALIFORNIA. IS TO BRING A LEADERSHIP ROLE. THE SHOW THAT YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR GRID SYSTEM. YOU CAN CHANGE RENEW IT TOURING NOBLE SYSTEM WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A STRONG ECONOMY. WAS BACK IN JULY OF LAST YEAR WHEN THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL pI TOLD THEM. IF YOU WOULD PUT IN THE SAME SAFEGUARDS THAT WE PUT IN CAP AND TRADE I'LL BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. WE SUBMITTED THOSE TO THEM NOTHING CAME BACK. WE SUBMITTED A MEGA WATT LATER NOTHING CAME BACK. AND NOW I LOOK AT IT INFORMED ME TODAY. AND IT SAYS IT IN GENERALITIES THERE'S NO SPECIFICS DEL WITH RELIABLE SUSTAINABLE. AND COST EFFECTIVE ENERGY. IT TALKS A GENERALITY THERE DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT THE LA OPEN CABINET TRADE HAS TO REPORT TO S. ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THIS DOESN'T HAVE THAT. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT OF THOSE A DROP IN THE ECONOMY THAT WE WOULD TAKE AND OFFRAMP AND SLOW IT DOWN. IT DOESN'T SAY THAT IN ANY DETAIL. SPEED BUMPS ARE THERE THE LEADERSHIP WE HAVE HERE. THE LEADERSHIP WE HAVE HERE. IS TO PASS A BILL. THAT WE CAN SHOW THE WORLD. ON HOW TO DO IT. I'M ALL FOR THE 100% I'M ALL FOR SAVING THE WORLD. I'M ALL FOR MAKING US LEADERS IN THE WORLD AND SHOWING THE WAY FORWARD. BUT THIS DOESN'T KNOW IT. I'D ASK FOR NO VOTE [inaudible] ESTHER GRAY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THEY MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS RECENTLY. A STAFF MEMBER MIND WAS IN A MEETING IN THIS BUILDING IN. WAS RAISING A QUESTION WITH ANOTHER STAFF MEMBER THAT. ATTENTION ALL OF THE TWO COUNTIES I REPRESENT SENSE ABOUT BEING LEFT OUT OF A BILL. AND THE RESPONSE THEY GOT WAS WHEN NOBODY LIVES THERE. THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. WHAT SAID TO THE LA TIMES? WHY BUILD ANYTHING OUT THERE THERE'S NOTHING BUT TUMBLEWEEDS? THAT IS THE DISRESPECT. AND DISREGARD THIS INSTITUTION SHOWS. TO THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK AND AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER. IN A LAUNDRY LIST OF BILLS. SCREAMING A TORY [inaudible] WHY REPRESENT? HE WON'T TALK ABOUT HOW 2% RENEWABLE ENERGY WE'VE HAD A PORTIONS OF MY DISTRICT FOR YEARS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT REWARD. WE'VE RECEIVED FOR MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS. HAVING EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL AND EVERY BILL THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE SUBJECT. POOR PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT PAY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIGHER RATES. SO THAT WE CAN. LOOK TO THE FUTURE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ASPIRATIONAL LEGISLATION SO THAT WE CAN GO HOME. AND SAY TO THE BERNIE CRAPS OR WHOEVER ELSE THAT WE'RE PROGRESSIVE AND WE DID SOME. WHAT YOU DID IS RAISE UTILITY RATES ON CORPORATE? AND EVERYBODY ELSE. WE ALL PAY ON THIS. DOES THAT MEAN. CLIMATE CHANGE IS AN IMPORTANT. NO CLIMATE CHANGE'S SERIOUS. CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRE SERIOUS PEOPLE. IT'S SERIOUS SOLUTIONS. NOT TALKING POINT BILLS. THOUGH WE CAN ALL PATTERSON WAS ON THE BACK AND PRETEND LIKE WE'VE DONE SOMETHING. IF I WERE TO ASK THE AUTHOR THIS BILL. WHY IS HYDROPOWER NOT INCLUDED WHY IS IT NOT CONSIDERED RENEWABLE? THERE'S NO SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT POSITION. AND WE GET SOME NONSENSE. EXCUSES TO WHY WE COULDN'T DO THIS YOU COULDN'T DO THAT. COULDN'T BE INTELLECTUALLY HONEST IN OUR JOB. THEY WERE JUST GOING TO DO THE TALKING POINT DEL AND SET THESE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS IT GETS TIRESOME. PEOPLE WERE I LIVE DRIVE LONGER HOURS TO WORK THEY PAY MORE FOR GAS. THEY LIVE IN A CLIMATE THAT'S HARDER WE PAY MORE FOR UTILITY RATES. WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH A SERIOUSLY. SERIOUSLY DIFFICULT ISSUE ON WILDFIRES [inaudible] PRODUCED MORE. GREENHOUSE GAS ISSUES. THAN ANYTHING WE'VE SITE. BUT WE'RE JUST GONNA. SKATE OVER THE FACTS. YEAH AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH DISHONEST IN POLITICS. LET'S NOT TRY NOT TO JOIN THE PARTY. I WOULD ASK YOUR NO VOTE TODAY. MR MACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS I'VE ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION A TODAY ON THIS TOPIC AND I LIKE OF THE MEMBER OF FROM FROM OCEANSIDE. I'M I AM SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL -- AND I'M A CONSERVATIVE. I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN WE'VE GONE. A LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THAT BELIEVE SYSTEM. AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM. UP FROM MERCED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THE FOR THAT TO TO LOOK AT THIS IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF THE NEEDS OF OF CALIFORNIANS. YOU I VOTED NO ON THIS BILL IN A COMMITTEE. BUT IT WASN'T BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE EFFORT AND THE BECAUSE IN FACT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET TO A POINT TO OUR LOGICAL SYSTEM IS. A 100% RENEWABLE THAT IT IS CLEAN AND THAT IT IS ZERO CARBON. THE REALITY IS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY ALL OF US HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO FACTOR THAT IN OUR OWN LIVES. AND TRY TO RID THAT NEGATIVE X. NOW DO WE KNOW IT IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON OUR STATE. AND OUR COUNTRY. IN OUR WORLD AND YES WE ARE LEADER HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. BUT I THINK THIS BILL HAS A FEW ERRORS IN IT IN FACT. BEARS ARE THAT. WE'RE PICKING WINNERS. AND WE'RE PICKING LOSERS AND I THINK OUR GOAL NEEDS TO BE TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. WE DON'T NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY [inaudible] WE HAVE TIME NEXT YEAR AND I'M COMMITTED MYSELF I KNOW THERE'S A HANDFUL OF OTHER REPUBLICANS THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH A PROGRAM. THAT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. THEN MAKE SURE THAT WE GET RID OF THAT NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY WHICH IS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR A HEALTHY. AND I BY AN ECONOMY ARE GOING FORWARD. SO I'D ASK THAT TODAY THAT'S JUST HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON LET'S BEGIN WORKING IN THE FALL MAYBE NEXT YEAR I'LL TRY TO PUT A BIPARTISAN PLAN TOGETHER. FOR TODAY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN OBOE [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THEN A LONG DISCUSSION BUT I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE POINTS MADE BY. MY COLLEAGUE FROM [inaudible] MERCED. WHEN YOU PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS? IN LEGISLATION THAT MANDATES CERTAIN THINGS. ARE OKAY UNDER THE LAW AND OTHER THINGS ARE NOT. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT. AND MY DISTRICT IS GOING TO FEEL THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DECISION MADE. MANY MANY YEARS AGO. TO NOT INCLUDE NUCLEAR POWER IN THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. DIABLO CANYON THE LAST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT LEFT IN CALIFORNIA WHICH PROVIDES. 9% OF THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY WITH ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN 9%. THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY WITH ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WHITE HYDRO POWER THERE IS NO SCIENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF INCLUSION OF NUCLEAR POWER. IN THE RPF STANDARD. NOW THAT'S HISTORY THAT'S FINE BUT I JUST OFFER THAT ILLUSTRATION BECAUSE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DIABLO CANYON IS GOING OFF LINE IT'S SHUTTING DOWN IT WILL BE DECOMMISSIONED OVER [inaudible] DECADES. MY COMMUNITY WILL LOSE FIFTEEN HUNDRED HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD JOBS AND A BILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC. ACTIVITY IN MY DISTRICT I HOPE. IT IS NOT LIKE THE CLOSING OF THE STEEL MILLS IN PITTSBURGH. BUT I FEAR IT MIGHT BE. SO WHEN YOU PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS IN LEGISLATION PLEASE REMEMBER. THAT THERE ARE LOSERS. AND ISRAEL AND IMPACTS THE COMMUNITY. IN A MAJOR MAJOR WAY. THAT IS NOT TO SAY I DON'T ACCEPT SCIENCE AYE DEGREE IN PHYSICS. STOOD WITH PEOPLE. THAT SHOWED TREMENDOUS COURAGE LAST YEAR CROSSING THE AISLE TO ENACT A SIGNATURE. PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT A LOT OF US PAY THE COST. FOR FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ECONOMY. I ACCEPT SCIENCE. I THINK CLIMATE CHANGE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT OTHER THINGS HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED TO PUTTING ECONOMICS. I ASKED YOU TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON WHAT'S GO BACK TO WORK ON THIS. AND NEXT YEAR WHAT'S ENACT SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE'LL LOOK AT AS A MODEL. FOR HOW THE ENTIRE WORLD IS GOING TO SOLVE EXISTENTIAL PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MEMBERS. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS IF I LISTEN TO ALL OF YOU IT SOUNDS GOOD. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE. THERE'S NO PLAN I HEARD. THE SAME PERSON WHO SAID THERE'S NO PLAN SUGGESTED IN TEN YEARS WILL HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S WHY WE CANNOT PRESCRIBE. WHAT TYPE OF POWER THIS'S? THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY. DO MORE THAN SET THE GOALS. BECAUSE THAT PLAN HAS TO CONTINUE TO BE WRITTEN AND RE WRITTEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW IN TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. OUR SOURCES OF POWER ARE GOING TO CHANGE THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF PRESCRIPTIVE PLAN. YOU WOULD WANT OR COULD VOTE ON AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CUTTING OFF LITTLE PIECES OF PORK FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT IN THE TYPE OF POWER. THAT YOU WANT IN YOUR DISTRICT AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT. IT DOESN'T ITS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. IT HAS TO BE BECAUSE OUR TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. AND BECAUSE IT IS OUR NEXT GENERATION WHO ARE GOING TO NOT ONLY. BENEFIT FROM THIS AS FAR AS CLIMATE CHANGE BUT BENEFITS FROM THIS BECAUSE THERE THE INNOVATORS WE'RE GOING TO BE CHANGING. HOW WE SEE? ELECTRICITY IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE WE NO THAT WE CAN GO CARBON FREE WE KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEMS MEETING THOSE. RENEWABLE STANDARDS. WE KNOW THIS. SO THIS ALLOWS A PLAN TO COME BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE. AFTER WE MEET OUR 60% CALL. THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S A LOT LIKE AT THAT POINT WE ARE. THOSE FOLKS TO WILL REPLACE AS CAN ASPIRIN ALEJO ANALYSIS. WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WHAT TODAY IS ABOUT THE SAME ARE WE GONNA HOLD OUR FEET TO THE FIRE ON THIS ISSUE. HOPEFULLY ON FRIDAY WE'RE GOING TO ASK IF WE HOLD OUR FEET TO THE FIRE ON THE WILDFIRE. BECAUSE FOR THE FOLKS WHO SAID IT'S NOT JUST ELECTRICITY YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE TO NOT DEAL. WITH THE ELECTRICAL GRID. IT'S THE EASIEST ONE IT'S A LOWEST HANGING FRUIT ABSOLUTELY ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT TAILPIPES ABSOLUTELY ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WILD FIRES ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT. TO AND EVEN IF FOR JUST A LITTLE CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SHOWING BY EXAMPLE THAT THIS CAN BE DONE. SINCE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE COST OF SOLAR HAS COME DOWN 77%. AND LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE U. S. ENERGY. INC [inaudible] INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION. YOU'LL FIND S.. WE PAY ONE THIRD PER HOUSEHOLD. FOR ELECTRICAL UTILITY RATES AS TEXAS. WE PAY A HALF. OF WHAT LOUISIANA PAYS. THERE ARE INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY I UNDERSTAND THIS I LIVE IN A DISTRICT WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING AND YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER DEAD. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP RUNNING AIR CONDITIONERS? ALMOST ALL THE TIME. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POOR FAMILIES AND HOW THIS AFFECTS POOR FAMILIES I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY OF WORKING CLASS FAMILIES I REPRESENT A COMMITTEE WORKING CLASS FAMILIES? FIRST WELL LET'S BE HONEST WE HAVE A GREAT. PROGRAM THERAPY YOU SEE THAT HELPS OUR POOREST FAMILIES PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS FIRST OF ALL BUT SECOND. THEY'RE HAVING A DISPROPORTIONATE [inaudible] CHALLENGE. BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. A LOT OF OUR HOUSES DON'T EVEN HAVE ELECTRICITY SO YOU HAVE FANS AND PEOPLE TRYING TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACTUALLY PUT AN ELECTRIC ARE PUT IN AIR CONDITIONING BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A IT WASN'T EVEN. IMAGINED THAT IF YOU LIVE IN COASTAL SAN DIEGO THAT YOU WOULD NEED AIR CONDITIONING. AND NOW YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT. THAT'S REALITY AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN IT ALL THE TIME IT DOES MAKE YOUR ENERGY RATES GO UP IT MAKES YOUR UTILITY BILL GO UP. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING I KNOW IN MY AND IN IN MY NEIGHBORING -- IMPERIAL COUNTY. THERE IS A THIRTY SECONDS MISS FLETCHER. SO I APPRECIATE WHAT WAS SAID TODAY A LOT OF IT IS ARGUING A DIFFERENT POINT. BUT THIS IS ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND I JUST ASK FOR ONE THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THE AUTHOR. I DON'T CARE. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. I THINK HE'S A GREAT GUY BUT THIS IT IS ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO SET GOALS. THAT WE CAN REACH. AND BE PROUD OF OURSELVES TO REDUCE. THE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN BE BOILED IN LEAD THE WAY IT'S SUPPORTED BY BY FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE THE FORMER. REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER AND BY EVERY SCIENTIST WHO'S LOOKED AT IT. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO LEAD THE WAY I ASK THAT YOU DON'T PLAY GAMES TODAY I ASK THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE FUTURE AND VOTE I WITHOUT THE CLERK LOCAL THE ROLE.

AND AS I SEE IT FUNDAMENTALLY THIS MAY CHOICE AND IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT WORKING WOMEN. WHO CHOOSE TO PUMP BREAST MILK AREN'T UNFAIRLY DISADVANTAGED IN THEIR PLACE OF IT OF EMPLOYMENT? AND I KNOW FROM MY WIFE'S EXPERIENCES MEMBERS. AS WELL AS FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF SO MANY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. THE PUMPING BREASTMILK AT WORK CAN BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. AND THAT TO AND TIME CONSUMING AND THAT WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO MAKE THE DECISION TO PUMP CAN SOMETIMES STRUGGLE. TO BALANCE THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND THEIR JOBS IFTHEY ARE PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE FACILITIES. AND WITHOUT ADEQUATE FACILITIES WOMEN MAY FEEL THAT THEY'RE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR CAREERS AND PROVIDING THEIR CHILDREN WITH THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF BREAST MILK. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY CALIFORNIAN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO THAT MAKE THAT CHOICE. ON THE CONTRARY I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO BREASTFEED AFTER THEY WERE TORN TO THE LABOR FORCE. NOT RELEGATE THEM TO A BATHROOM STALL. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE IF YOU SUPPORT WOMEN IF YOU SUPPORT FAMILIES IF YOU SUPPORT CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THANK YOU COLLEAGUES SB ELEVEN HUNDRED BY SENATOR PORTANTINO PROHIBITS THE SALE OF ANY FIREARM BY A LICENSED DEALER. TO ANY PERSON BELOW THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE UNLESS THE PERSON HAS A VALID HUNTING LICENSE IS AN ACTIVE OR HONORABLY DISCHARGED A MEMBER OF THE MILITARY. OR AN ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES A PERSON TO BE TWENTY ONE TO PURCHASE A HANDGUN. BUT ONLY REQUIRES A PERSON TO BE EIGHTEEN TO PURCHASE ALL OTHER GUNS OVER THE YEARS LONG GUNS HAVE CHANGE THEY AREN'T JUST YOUR GRANDFATHER'S TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUN IN THE CLOSET ANYMORE TODAY'S SEMI AUTOMATIC. GUNS ARE MORE POWERFUL. AND MORE LETHAL WHILE HANDGUNS ARE USED IN THE MAJORITY OF GUN DEATHS LONG GUNS HAVE BEEN USED TO PERPETRATE MANY OF THE LARGEST MASS SHOOTINGS. IN US HISTORY INCLUDING THE TRAGIC EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN SAN BERNARDINO CALIFORNIA. S. B. ELEVEN HUNDRED ALSO RECOGNIZES THE FACT THAT YOUNG ADULTS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ARE STATISTICALLY FAR MORE LIKELY. TO COMMIT HOMICIDE THAN OLDER ADULTS ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY REPRESENT JUST 4% OF THE POPULATION OVULATION BUT THEY COMMIT 17% OF GUN [inaudible] HOMICIDES TWO OF THE WERE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS IN AMERICAN HISTORY AT MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL AND PARK IN FLORIDA AND AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN NEWTOWN CONNECTICUT WERE COMMITTED. BY PERPETRATORS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AFTER SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED THAT MARJORIE STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. ENACTED SIMILAR LEGISLATION TO THE SIGNED BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. COMPANIES LIKE DICK'S SPORTING GOODS IN WALMART RECENTLY CHANGED THEIR POLICIES TO NO LONGER SELL FIREARMS TO CUSTOMERS UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. GUNS IN THE HANDS OF YOUNG ADULTS MAY SADLY ALSO LEAD TO MORE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS THAT RESULTS IN FATALITIES. DATA SHOWS ABOUT 38% OF ALL SUICIDE BY PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE ARE COMMITTED WITH A GUN AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. A LONG GUN IS USED RATHER THAN A HANDGUN. S. B. ELEVEN HUNDRED IS THE NEXT STEP IN CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON PROACTIVE GUN SAFETY POLICIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THIS IS YET ANOTHER BILL THAT TAKES AWAY THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.

IF WE WANNA TAKE GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS THEN WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BACKLOG OF ALMOST TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE ARMED BUT PROHIBITED FROM OWNING A FIREARM. UNDER CURRENT LAW. WE SHOULD STOP TREATING LAW ABIDING SIT CITIZENS AND ADULTS LIKE CHILDREN. EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD CAN VOTE. GET A JOB WITHOUT A PERMIT.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE BY FAMILY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE TRANSPORTATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER BACK ON CONCURRENCE AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE IS A REGIONAL BILL. ADDRESSING THE BEAR IS MOST INTENSE CHALLENGES OF HOUSING AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION WITH A NARROWLY CRAFTED TRANSIT ORIENTED POLICY. ITS NARROW BECAUSE IT ONLY APPLIES TO LAND OWNED BY PART NEXT DEPART STATIONS IT IT IT WOULD APPLY TO ABOUT TWO AND A FIFTY ACRES. AROUND TWENTY SIX PART STATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SURFACE PARKING LOTS THIS BILL REQUIRES PART TO ESTABLISH BASIC TIER DE STANDARDS ONLY IN AREAS WHERE RESIDENTS. DIRECTLY ELECT PARKS BOARD MEMBERS JORDY VOTED ON THIS FLOOR WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE DEEPLY WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND THREE THREE SENATE COMMITTEES MADE MANY AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AMENDMENTS INCLUDE ELIMINATING STREAMLINING FOR PROJECTS NOT WITHIN ONE STORY OF EXISTING LOCAL HEIGHTS. LIMITING THIS BILL TO LAND CURRENTLY ON BY BART AND ON INFILL SITES REQUIRE IMPART TO ADDRESS COMMUTERS WHO RELY ON PARTS COMMUTER PARKING. EXEMPTING CITIES AT A PARTY IMPLEMENTED SUITABLE ZONING INCREASING THE DEPTH OF AFFORDABILITY 420% OF UNITS THAT HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE EACH STATION. 30% OF UNITS NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO. EXPANDING LOCAL CONSULTATION REQUIREMENTS DIFFERENT A LOCAL SPECIFIC PLANS AND REQUIRING AN AUTOMATIC SUNSET. THIS BILLS EXTREMELY TARGETED WITH NUMEROUS CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE BURIED NEEDS DESPERATELY TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CONGESTION CRISIS WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. I THINK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE TODAY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL ONE THAT I VOTED AGAINST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ME MEMBER GRAYSON. WHO MADE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE SENATE TO NARROW THE SCOPE AND INCLUDE A ROLE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES? IT'S NOW A BETTER BILL THEN WE HEARD THE COMMITTEE IN APRIL. WE ALL HAVE TO ADMIT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS REAL I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S GOAL TO INCREASE HOUSING AROUND BART STATIONS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO DEAL WITH LOCAL AGENCIES. WHO JUST DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY DON'T DO THEIR PART WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORTING APPROVING HOUSING? THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SPUR THE EROSION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING AND APPROVAL AUTHORITY TO FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I'M STILL DEEPLY TROUBLED ABOUT THIS BILLS PRESIDENT AND ABOUT THE IMPACT ON ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTIONAL LEVEL. ELEVEN THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE MADE IN MAKING LAND USE DECISIONS. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE TELLING THE LOCALS. WHO ARE ACTUALLY STRIVING TO SITE PERMITS AND BUILD A DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING THAT THEIR EFFORTS DON'T MATTER? THEY WILL STILL LOSE THEIR LANDING USE AUTHORITY LIKE THOSE WHO SHIRK THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I AM FEARFUL THAT OTHERS WILL RUSH TO GRAB SUCH AUTHORITY WITHOUT FIRST GIVING US A CHANCE TO SEE HOW THIS VERY UNIQUE EXPERIMENT MAY WORK IN THIS LIMITED ENVIRONMENT. I PREDICT YOU'LL HEAR ME REPEAT THIS NEXT YEAR. FOR THESE REASONS I REGRETTABLY CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. EVEN WHAT THE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN THE SENATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE I FULLY SUPPORT TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. BUT AS THE CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT INCREASING HOUSING YOUR TRANSIT. HELPS EASE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ARE ROSA MAKES THE DAILY GRIND. OF A COMMUTE EVEN EASIER HOWEVER. I CANNOT SPORTY AB. TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINING VERY CORE PRINCIPLE OF THIS STATE. LOCAL CONTROL OVER LAND USE. LET ME REPEAT. LOCAL CONTROL OVER LAND USE ANY OF YOU WHO WERE ELECTED MUNICIPAL. ELECTIVES ALWAYS HATED WHEN SOMEBODY CAME IN AND TOLD WHAT YOU WHAT YOU HAD TO DO. HE BOWED YOUR NECK. AND YOU SAID NO. THEN WE HAVE THE RIGHT FOR LAND USE. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE WOULD SAID A SIGNIFICANT PRESIDENT BY GIVING SPECIAL TRANSIT DISTRICT NOT A CITY OR A COUNTY. LAND USE PLANNING AND DECISION AUTHORITY AND REQUIRE THE SURROUNDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONFORM. TWO THE BOARD ADOPTED GUIDELINES. MARK CURRENTLY CAN DEVELOP BORROWED LAND AROUND THEIR STATIONS RIGHT NOW. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS RARE REALITY THAT IN THE RECENT YEARS CITIES HAVE APPROVED THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS NEAR BART STATIONS. AND BART HASN'T HAD A DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION REJECTED. OH MY GOD. IN A DECADE. LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY NOT OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF INCONSISTENT PLANNING THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH CITY AND COUNTY GENERAL PLANS. AND JUST THINK ABOUT IT THIS MAY WORK IN A MUNICIPAL OUR EXCUSE ME UNIT IN A IRVINE OR A A VERY -- BICU DE PRIME LOCATION. BUT NOT IN RURAL BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED IT CREATES AN INCONSISTENCY FOR DEVELOPERS AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND NOW. THEY'RE GONNA BE SHIRKING THE WILLINGNESS TO GO FORWARD LET'S SOME. KEEP IT THAT WAY NOT OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF INCONSISTENT PLANNING. THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH CITY AND COUNTY GENERAL PLANS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE. OVER YEARS AND YEARS OF CONSIDERATION. BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS ALSO. LET'S AGREE THAT PLANNING FOR METROPOLITAN AREAS VERSUS SUBURBAN AREAS AS I SAID SUCH AS MINE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT. GENERAL PLANS FOR AVAILABLE LAND IN THE SOBRE SUBURBS MUST NOT BE STYMIED BY A METROPOLITAN DEVELOPERS. THE AIM IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR REGION. THE GENERAL PLANS WHICH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THE CONSTITUENTS HAVE AGREED UPON IN MANY CASES HAVE TAKEN AS I MENTIONED. YEARS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT. THOUSANDS OF MY CONSTITUENTS BREITBART EVERY DAY AND RECENTLY A NEW STATION OPEN IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF ANTIOCH. THE PLANNING FOR THAT STATION OF WHICH I PARTICIPATED IN. AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL REYES GRAVE CONCERNS. FOR ME REGARDING BART'S PLANNING PROCESS. AGAIN THE BEST LOCAL ADVICE AND STATISTICS. BART'S NEW STATION WAS OPEN WITHOUT PROVING. PROVIDING ADEQUATE PARKING OR ADEQUATE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE VOLUME OF WRITERS THAT WE KNEW WE WOULD SEE BUT THEY IGNORE. MY CITIES OF BRENTWOOD IN PITTSBURGH ARE OFFICIALLY OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION AND IN FACT. THE CITY OF BROWN WOULD SHARE CONCERNS OVER HOW THE BILL WOULD AFFECT ONGOING DEVELOPMENT. PLANS FOR A POSSIBLE FUTURE E. BART STATION. THIS IS BEING STUDIED NOW WITH FULL BART INVOLVEMENT. AS STATED BY THE CITY OF BROWN WITH THIS BILLS ENTIRELY INCONSISTENT WITH LOCAL CONTROL OF LAND USE POLICIES AND PLANNING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHERE IT BELONGS IN FACT CITIES THROUGHOUT THE BOARD DISTRICT INCLUDING CITIES AND ENTITIES LOCATED WITHIN? THESE AUTHORS DISTRICTS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION. AS WE WOULD EXPECT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SEC ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSED ALSO. I ALSO HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS THE BOARD AMBITIOUSLY PLANNING TO TEO DE CONSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. DOES NOT HAVE THE CAR CAPACITY. SERVE THOSE DOD'S. OUR CURRENT PLAN FOR IS FOR ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY CARS. AT A TOTAL COST OF FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH THE ONLY HAVE ABOUT 60% ABOUT FUNDED. NOT WITHSTANDING THE FUNDING SHORTAGE THE ADDITIONAL TRAIN CARS WILL HOPEFULLY MEET. THE CURRENT RIDERSHIP NEEDS AS WELL AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FUTURE BART TO SAN JOSE WRITERS. THIS IS AN ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE. THIRTY SECONDS LEFT LOOK AT THE PLEASANT HILL BART STATION ONCE DESCRIBES IT EXEMPLARY MODEL OF TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT INVITING RESIDENTS WORKERS A SHOPPERS TO DRIVE LESS. AND TAKE MORE TRANSIT WELL PLANNING FOR THE TOUR DE PLEASANT HILL BART STATION BEGIN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT THEY THEY GET OCCUPANCY IN THE APARTMENTS UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND TEN FINALLY IN THE SPIRIT PLEASE OF COURSE SEE I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT THE AUTHORS OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL WILL MEMBERS. WHO HAVE STATIONS IN THEIR DISTRICT TO ASCERTAIN SUPPORT AS WELL AS FORTY FIVE YEARS OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ROUNDS BART'S PLANNING AND FUNDING CHALLENGES YOUR TIME IS UP A FEW COLLEAGUES THIS IS A DISTRICT BILL THE PROBLEM IS? IT'S IN THE WRONG DISTRICT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOBLE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES WHO WORKED. ON THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH SAN MATEO COUNTY WILL BENEFIT AS WILL THE OTHER PART COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE IS A TARGETED A BALANCED APPROACH WITH IMPORTANT GUARD RAILS. SUCH AS A SUNSET CLAUSE. STRONG DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AN EXTENSIVE LOCAL COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS MEMBERS WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE STATE AND REGIONAL HOUSING GOALS AND CONGESTION GOALS IN CLIMATE. CHANGE GOALS AS WELL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE ABOVE AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS ENGAGEMENT ON THE SPELL IT HE DID SOMETHING THAT NOT MANY MEMBERS DO WHEN YOU ARE OPPOSED TO BELEIVE MET WITH MY CONSTITUENTS -- FOR AN HOUR OVER THE JULY RECESS I TO HEAR FROM THEM AND WHY THEY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR DOING THAT NOT MANY US WOULD DO THAT FOR FOLKS THAT ARE. NOT THEIR CONSTITUENTS THE REASON THEY CAME TO MEET WITH THE AUTHORS IS BECAUSE THIS BILL DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS MY CONSTITUENTS. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BILL THAT IS THIS DRAMATIC DEPARTURE NOT ONLY FROM OUR PRACTICE BUT FROM OUR CONSTITUTION AGAIN ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTIONAL LEVIN. CRYSTAL CLEAR. THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKING ON HOUSING NEEDS TO BE KEPT WITH THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES YOU NEED TO HAVE VERY VERY GOOD REASONS TO DO IT. YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE REASONS MIGHT BE THAT PART HAS BEEN SUBMITTING AGAIN AND AGAIN. DIFFERENT PROPOSALS TO THE CITIES THAT THEY'VE CONTINUALLY REJECTED. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. AS ARE MEMBERS FROM OKLEE JUST IDENTIFIED BART HAS NOT PROPOSED A SINGLE PROPOSAL FOR DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN REJECTED BY A SINGLE ENTITY AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. SO IT'S NOT THAT PORTS PROPOSALS ARE GETTING REJECTED THAT'S THAT'S NOT A REASON TO GO AGAINST OUR PRACTICE MAYBE IT'S THAT THE CITIES THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. ARE THE ONES THAT KEEP SAYING NO TO TRANSIT AREA DEVELOPMENT WHICH I FULLY EMBRACE. AND BELIEVE WE NEED TO TO HAVE AND PROMOTE TO HELP WITH THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS ALSO NOT THE CASE. THE CITY'S MOST AFFECTED BY THIS BILLS ARE THE ONES IN THE STATE WHO ARE THE VERY BEST AUTHORS. OF ALL KINDS OF PROPOSALS FOR TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE EMBRACING IT MORE THAN OTHER CITIES AND YOU JUST NEED LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE CITY OF DUBLIN WHERE I'VE LIVED FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAS APPROVED OVER FOUR THOUSAND UNITS JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. TWO THOUSAND MULTI FAMILY UNITS ALONE ARE WITHIN A HALF MILE THE BART STATION. TWO THOUSAND IN FACT ARE USED TO BE A LARGE SURFACE LOT AT THAT DUBLIN STATION TRIPLE THE SIZE OF THE SERVICE A LOT AND IT'S ALL MULTI FAMILY. UNITS HIGH DENSITY HOUSING RIGHT NOW TODAY. IN FACT THE CITY OF DUBLIN IS MEETING ITS RINA NUMBERS FIVE YEARS IN ADVANCE AND THEY ARE THE NUMBER ONE CITY AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. PLEASANTON WHICH ALSO HAS A BART STATION WITH THE SURFACE PARKING LOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL HAS ALSO BUILT OVER A THOUSAND MULTI FAMILY HIGH DENSITY UNITS WITHIN A HALF MILE OF THE BART STATION. THEY WANTED TO DO MORE. THEY WANTED TO DO MORE UNITS AND IN FACT THEY APPROVED A PLAN FOR MORE UNITS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED UNITS ON BART OWNED LAND. AND BART SAID NO. BURKE SAID NO I'D RATHER HAVE A COMMERCIAL OFFICE LEASE. SO THE CITY AGAIN APPROVED HOUSING AND BART SAID NO. THE CITY OF WANNA CREEK IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. THEY'VE APPROVED ALMOST A THOUSAND UNITS WITHIN A HALF MILE OF THEIR WANNA CREEK STATION. AND WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO MORE THE REASON WHY THEY COULDN'T DO MORE WAS BECAUSE OF PART. BART DIDN'T HAVE CLEAR TITLE TO ITS OWN PROPERTY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO DO IT. AND YOU NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S OWN REPORT FROM EARLIER THIS SUMMER THAT SAYS. DUBLIN SAN RAMON PLEASANTON THE TRI VALLEY CITIES MOST AFFECTED BY THIS BILL ARE MEETING THEIR GOALS TOWARDS HOUSING THE THREE LOCATIONS. IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE NOT MEETING THEIR GOALS ARE SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOSE AND OAKLAND. THEY WON'T MEET THEIR GOALS UNTIL THE NEXT CENTURY. THEY'RE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS BILL EXCEPT ONE LOCATION SAN FRANCISCO SO MAKE IT A DISTRICT BILL. SO IT'S NOT THE PART IS HAVING ITS PROPOSALS REJECTED IT'S NOT THAT THE CITY'S REJECTING PROPOSALS. THESE ARE THE VERY CITIES THAT ARE DOING THE MOST TO PROMOTE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. AND LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE AGENCY TO WHICH A YES VOTE WILL GIVE CONTROL OVER HOUSING. RIGHT NOW PARTISAN THE HEADLINES FOR STABBINGS. FOR CRYING THEY HAVE A CRIME CRISIS THAT HAD A OF THIS YEAR IN VIOLENT CRIME IF WE KEEP ON PACE WITHOUT. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A 60% 66% RISE IN CRIME MISTER THURMAN. WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF ORDER MADAM SPEAKER I BELIEVE THAT TALKING ABOUT CRIMES THAT HAVE OCCURRED? FALL OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHAT THIS BILL PROPOSES PLEASE DIRECT. SPEAKER TO STAY WITHIN THE MERITS OF THE BILL AT HAND. ONE IS NOT WELL TAKEN YOU MAY CONTINUE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN ADDITION. FEMA'S THIS IS THE CRIME CRISIS THAT BART HOW'S THAT SO DRAMATIC JUST YESTERDAY FEMA THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY AWARDED A GRANT OF SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TO IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION TRY TO HELP PART GET CONTROL OF ITS CRIME. IN ITS OPERATIONS. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE NEW TRACK THAT'S FUNCTIONING WELL. JUST YESTERDAY IN THE HEADLINES THERE'S A TRACK MALFUNCTIONING CONTRA COSTA THAT WON'T BE FIXED ANYTIME SOON. THEY'RE ESCALATORS ARE OUT OF ORDER 83% OF THE TIME IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST BUSIEST STATIONS FOR OUTSIDERS THEY'RE OUT OF ORDER 3% 83% OF THE TIME. AND IN ADDITION THE NEW TRAINS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE. AND THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED. TO HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIXES IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR. NEVER MIND THE FARE EVASION. AND THE BARD IS DROWNING IN ITS OWN PROBLEMS. THAT'S THE AGENCY THE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE HOUSING FROM THE CITY'S UNDER YOUR IN I WAS A PARTNERSHIP UP PLEASE AND MEMBERS I WILL CLOSE WITH. LET HER FINISH FIVE FIVE SECONDS AS I'M CLOSING THIS IS THE STATEMENT AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY A THIRD OF THE PARK BOARD OPPOSES THIS BILL IT'S THE STATEMENT FROM ONE OF THEIR DIRECTORS. I OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW YOUR CITIES AS WELL AS YOU DO. MEMBERS THERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION REQUIRE COLLABORATION OF THESE TWO PARTIES PART IN THE CITIES DO NOT TAKE HOUSING AWAY FROM THEM AND GIVE IT TO AN AGENCY THAT WILL FAIL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND FOR SHARING MY PASSION OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN THE BAY AREA AND THOSE THAT VISIT THE BAY AREA. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE BART I GUESS OR ARE FEEL GOOD ON BART TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS STATE IS FACING A HOUSING CRISIS WE WORKED VERY HARD LAST YEAR. TO POWER TO PASS A HOUSING PACKAGE TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS THAT IS OVERWHELMING OUR OUR OUR STATE. AND SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE A BIT OF A A PERSPECTIVE ABOUT BART WHEN IT COMES TO MY CITY -- WHILE I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVING ON COUNCIL. BART SHOWS OUR DOWNTOWN STATION AS A PLACE FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AS ONE OF THEIR SITES. THEY COULD HAVE EASILY COME UP WITH THEIR OWN PLANS AND JUST RAMMED IT THROUGH BUT INSTEAD THEY REACHED OUT THEY COLLABORATED THEY SOUGHT FOR ADVICE AND INPUT FROM THE CITY COUNCIL. WE WERE SO CRITICAL WE EVEN WENT DOWN TO THAT TYPE OF LIGHT STANDARDS THEY WERE GOING TO USE ALONG THE SIDEWALK. AND BART WILLINGLY MADE THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR PLANS TO ACCOMMODATE THE CITY COUNCIL'S REQUEST. AND SO THERE IS THAT COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BART HAS PRODUCED GREAT TEO DE AND OUT BUT THERE ARE SOME INCOMPLETE -- PROJECTS -- EVEN IN THE PAST TEN YEARS AS MY FACT I'D LIKE TO THINK THE ARGUMENT -- THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR HER ARGUMENT ABOUT. ONE PARTICULAR CITY WHO HAS ALREADY. WELL THE GOOD NEWS ON OUR BILL IS THAT IF YOU MEET ARENA NUMBERS YOU'RE ACTUALLY EXEMPT. AND SO IF YOU MEET A MAN IN ALL THE DIFFERENT -- CATEGORIES AND DIFFERENT LEVELS SO PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY BUT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO TAKE A FIFTEEN YEAR AVERAGE FROM THE TIME OF NEGOTIATION AUTHORIZATION TO COMPLETION. AND WE DID TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BRING OUR HOUSING SUPPLY UP. TO BETTER MEET THE DEMAND A KEY COMPONENT TO ANY LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR A HOUSING NEEDS. AND IN THE LARGEST CITY THAT'S AND MY DISTRICT THE TOTAL NET INCREASE IN THE HOUSING FROM HUNDRED NINE UNITS. THAT DID NOT QUITE MEET THE NEEDS OF HOUSING FOR OUR AREA THIS SIMPLY IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WE ARE FACING THIS HOUSING PRICES. AND BY CONNECTING AFFORDABLE MAKES USE HOUSING PROJECTS WITH CLOSE PROXIMITY AND ACCESSIBILITY TO BARK WE ARE MOVING THE BAY AREA TOWARDS A FUTURE. OF A WITH MORE LIVING UNITS AVAILABLE FOR WORKING FAMILIES FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD REDUCED MOBILE EMISSIONS THAT HARM OUR ENVIRONMENT AND A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL RESIDENTS. THE BILL THIS BILL WILL MOVE OUR REGION FORWARD WITH TRANSIT SMART TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT THAT BENEFITS FAMILIES WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS ALIKE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MEMBERS OF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CONVERSATIONS TO BARE MINIMUM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE AS ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY. THIS BILL AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE I HAVE. EIGHT BART STATIONS PLUS THE OPEN AIR PORT CONNECTOR IN MY DISTRICT. MANY OF THE STATIONS IN SAN LEANDRO AND IN OAKLAND MAY BE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY AB. TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE AND I BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE TACKLES SOME OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES HOUSING. CONGESTION GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IN EQUITY. IT DOES OWN A TARGETED WAY FOCUSING ON CRITICAL PIECES OF LAND WHICH FORTUNATELY ALSO HAPPEN TO BE UNDEVELOPED. GOVERNMENT OWNED LAND THAT MEANS WE CAN AVOID DISPLACEMENT AND DELIVER PUBLIC BENEFITS AT THE SAME TIME. WE'VE SEEN SOME GREAT COMMUNITIES BUILT AROUND BART STATIONS IN MY DISTRICT BUT IT TAKES TOO LONG. FOR EXAMPLE EXAMPLE CONSIDER FACE TO OF THE FOOD FAIL BART TRANSIT VILLAGE WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETION AND TWENTY NINETEEN A FULL TWENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE BART BOARD TOOK A VOTE. TO INITIATE NEGOTIATIONS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT TWENTY FIVE YEARS FOR THE REST OF OUR GREAT TRANSIT ORIENTED. COMMUNITIES BUT THE GREAT PLACES THAT BART WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE HOUSING JOBS AND SERVICES IT WILL INCREASE SAFETY BY BUILDING COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP. AND INCREASING ACTIVITY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND ON OUR STREETS AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE ALSO BUILDS IN STRONG AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS STRONG LABOR REQUIREMENTS STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND STRONG COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SUCH A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HAVE SERIOUS CHALLENGES WE MUST BE WILLING TO TRY NEW APPROACHES. AND BART STATIONS PROVIDE A UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE OUGHT NOT PASS UP I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE COLLEAGUES [inaudible] THANK YOU. I SEE NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU YOU MAKE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING OUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES. WITH WHOM WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE YET ARE AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN SAID I WAS HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH HER CONSTITUENTS. AND WE ENGAGED AT LENGTH WITH -- WITH WITH. INDIVIDUALS FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HAS ISSUES WITH THIS INCLUDED MANY AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT LET ME JUST PUT THIS. IN CONTEXT FOLKS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES OF LAND OWNED BY BART AROUND. TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN BART STATIONS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SURFACE PARKING LOTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS. AND LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF AND RAISED IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED. IT TOOK FOURTEEN YEARS TO BUILD TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE PARK STATION. NEXT TO BERKELEY. TWENTY YEARS IN MILLBRAE TWENTY TWO YEARS AND WALNUT CREEK TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN FRUITVALE IN OAKLAND FORTY THREE YEARS IN PLEASANT HILL. AND THOSE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ACTUALLY WANTED TO BUILD TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT THERE ARE CITIES THAT ARE READY TO BUILD OR WANT TO DO TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT AND I WANNA MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL. INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE CITIES IF THEY HAVE ZONED APPROPRIATELY. THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW BART WANTS TO GET RID OF COMMUTER PARKING THAT COULD NOT BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH. PART HAS SPENT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN RECENT YEARS ON REPLACEMENT AND EXPANSION PARKING AS PART OF THE STATIONARY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THERE WAS THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY CITES THE UNIQUE FACTORS Y. IT'S TAYLOR TO PART. INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THE BART BOARD IS DIRECTLY ELECTED BY RESIDENTS OF THE PART DISTRICT THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR ANY TRANSIT AGENCY OUTSIDE OF THE BAY AREA. THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE CONSTITUTION. THESE ARGUMENTS JUST DON'T HOLD WATER THIS BILL CLEARLY ADDRESSES MATTERS OF STATEWIDE CONCERN. LET ME JUST SAY THIS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO UNDER FIFTY ACRES OF SURFACE PARKING LOTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE FORTY FIVE YEARS. OF ART HISTORY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AT ITS CORE THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS BILL OUR CALL FOR THE STATUS QUO. AND AT A TIME. WHEN OUR STATE BUT PARTICULARLY THE BAY AREA IS EXPERIENCING THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISES AND CONGESTION CRISIS THAT ARE BAY AREA HAS SEEN WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING HERE COLLEAGUES WHAT ELSE WILL WE BE ABLE TO DO. WITH DATA RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK YOU MAY OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE.
