SENATE BILL NINETY FIVE BY SENATOR SKINNER AND AFTER LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGETS SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YES THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SB NINETY FIVE ESTABLISHES COVERT NINETEEN SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEDERAL RULES THAT ALLOW FOR. EMPLOYERS TO UTILIZE PAYROLL TAX CREDITS FOR THE SICK LEAVE AND SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO WEEKS OR EIGHTY HOURS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE FOR CORPORATE NINETEEN RELATED REASONS. THIS INCLUDES EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SUBJECT TO QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION TUTOR COKE NINETEEN. FOR CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS SUBJECT TO COPE NINETEEN QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION. WHO IS ATTENDING A COURT BID NINETEEN VACCINE APPOINTMENT OR EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS FROM THE VACCINE TO PREVENT THEM FROM WORKING OR WHO ARE CARING FOR A CHILD. WHO SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. THIS BILL PARS RETROACTIVELY TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WILL HAS A- END DATE SO IT IT ONLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS THE DATE THAT THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS THAT EMPLOYERS CAN UTILIZE FOR THIS PURPOSE- ACT CONCLUDE. THE BILL WAS A TO ADDRESS CA THAT WERE RAISED IN. THAT IT ONLY UP TO BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE IN. 72% OF CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES HAVE FEWER THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES AND SO THIS DOES NOT MANDATE THIS ON. THOSE EMPLOYERS HOWEVER EMPLOYER MAY TAKE IT OF IF SO CHOOSE TO BECAUSE THE TAX IS AVAILABLE. THE PAYROLL TAX PRETTY S OF TO ANY AND IN. HOWEVER ARE BILL ONLY ME TO FOR EMPLOYERS OF FIVE IN ABOUT. SO WITH THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE THE BILL STILL PER SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR WORK. AND THE MID OF IN OUR STATE. AND MEMBERS WITHOUT I ASK YOUR BOATS. SENATOR NIELSEN. MEMBERS DONALD SENATE I URGE A NO VOTE THIS IS PAUL. NOW I'LL MANY YEARS AGO THAT THE BY AND A- THE NET DOCUMENT IT'S A POLICY DOCUMENT EQUALLY IF NOT MORE SO. THAT'S OKAY I GET BUT IS MAJOR. IN ORDER TO THE OBJECT IN THAT BUS IN THE PROCESS NOT A HAS BEEN AND IN THE BUDGET RELAY TO THE BOX AND CAL. THAT IS A MILLION. FOR MORE THAN THIS BILL OVER. OF OUR CAN. JUST LAST YEAR'S FROM CALL HAVE BEEN LAW INTO YOUR OFFICE FROM AGREED. CITIZENS BY EDT YEAH WE'RE NOT TO DEAL WITH I HOPE NOT. THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT IS TO THE IN BY. THEREFORE I WOULD- URGE AND NO ON THE BILL. THERE ANY FURTHER. OR. TO CENTER GROVE I'M SORRY MY PA. THE OKAY MADAM HAS I UNDER THERE'S A GOOD ON THE GLASS. I TO RISING UP OF THE BILL I SEVERAL TO THE BUDGET- ONE THING THAT I IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THAT IT WAS A ONE TO ONE RECENT FOR BUSINESS ARE TO ONE CREDIT AND IT'S NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS- TO DOLLARS AND SOME CASES SPECIFICALLY THE CASE THAT THE BY CHAIR JUST MENTION. AND THEN THE STATE CALIFORNIA IS CONTROLLERS PER DAY A TAX CREDIT THE STATE FOR FIVE ELEVEN DOLLARS SO THERE'S THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN THEY HAVE TO COME FROM AND IT'S FROM GOING TO CAMP THE STRUGGLE BUSINESS TO MAKE A THE OTHER IS THAT IF DON'T HAVE A TAX. AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND YOU DON'T GET A TAX CREDIT MEAN GET A REFUND. SO ON THE LIABILITY ONLY GOOD IF YOU- OWE TAXES. WHEN YOU GET THIS TAX CREDIT THE OTHER THING IS. BUSINESS THAT ARE STILL. AND ALL OF OUR DISK. LIKE BUSINESS. THAT ARE. BIZ OWNERS. THAT HAVE THIRTEEN- TOOK ALL SHE- IN THESE BILLS. ABOUT THE TWENTY. PER 224% THRESHOLD. THESE BUSINESS HAVE TO LAY OUT THAT CAN. OUT RIGHT NOW. AND PAY THOSE EMPLOYEES THEY WOULDN'T GET ANY MONEY. IF ANY MANY. IF THE LIABILITY DOES EXIST REFI. UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. THE RIGHT TRACK. IS X. CAN. SO BASED. YOU HAVE. A THAT IF THIS PASSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S. IT IT'S GOING TO READ TO. MAKE BUSINESS. PAY FOR. LEASE THAT STARTED JANIE FIRST. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT LABOR SECTION TWO TWO SIX AND YOU LOOK AT THE BIO. THAT OCCUR- BASED ON. AN INACCURATE WEIGHT STAY. AND NOT. DURING THAT TIME FOR. THERE NO LANGUAGE THIS. THAT STOPS THE SOME. FOR BEING SO. FOR UP. MEANING THAT IN IF THEY GO BACK TO PAY SOME. JEAN FIRST THROUGH JAN. FOURTH IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE ALLEGE. TO SOMEBODY. TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF. THEY HAVE ENACT HER WAIT. FROM THAT. FOR WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF POPULAR WILL CREATE MANY. PLAN FOR THESE EMPLOYER THAT ARE STILL STRUGGLING. TO RECOVER FROM THE GOVERNOR SHUT DOWN AND NOT BEING ABLE TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESS. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE PAID- YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THERE'S A SAFETY NET UNDER EMPLOYMENT BUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE IN THE PLANNING. DEPARTMENT CAN'T GET BENEFITS OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE. OFF WORK. THE EMPLOYERS PAY FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED. I WISH THERE WAS A MECHANISM IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE SO THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE LOSS OF WAGES. BUT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER. BECAUSE THIS RETROACTIVITY IN THIS BILL IS DEVASTATING. IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A PAGA. LAWSUIT IT'S ABSURD. IF YOU HAVE A PAYCHECK FOR. PAYCHECK THIS IS WEEK DEAN SAID ONE OR WEAKENED DEAN SAID EIGHT. AND YOU PAY WEEK. THAT'S A VIOLATION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PAYCHECK PER EMPLOYEE. IN A TRACTOR AFTER FOR YEARS. SO IS A- HORRIBLE PEACEABLE. WHEN YOU LOOK IT FROM ON THE GO. AN OPERA. YEAH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING CARE OF ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC IN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND WE WANT TO STOP THE SPREAD. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER FOR OUR STRUGGLING BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE IN EVERY ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND SO I WOULD REQUEST IN ABOUT. SENATOR DRAWS ON. THANK YOU MANAGER I RISE TO SUPPORT IS BEING FIVE AND I ALL OF THE THAT WE INTO IT I AM CAN AS OTHERS ARE WITH THE EXEMPTS. ACCORDING TO EDT DATA ABOUT 90% OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES AN ESTIMATED FOUR MILLION WORKERS WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE PAID SICK LEAVE UNDER THE THRESHOLD OF THIS BILL. ASCENTIAL WORKERS ARE BEING LEFT OUT SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS THESE ARE OFTEN LOW WAGE WORKERS THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER LOW WAGE FRONT LINE WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ANY OTHER BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THEM IT MAKES NO SENSE OF THESE VULNERABLE WORKERS MUST WORK WHEN THEY ARE SICK. WHAT WE ARE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES RECEIVED AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PPP LOANS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE STATE HAS FUNDED TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS A FOUR FOLD INCREASE OVER THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WE PROVIDED IN EARLIER RELIEF. WE MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROVIDE THE MOST BASIC PROTECTION OF BEING ABLE TO STAY HOME WHILE SICK DURING THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU MENTION. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS IS A TOUGH BILL IN A LOT OF WAYS IT WAS TOUGH FOR ME AND I SHARES OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD- MENTIONED- ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS GOOD POLICY WE DON'T WANT SICK WORKERS COMING INTO WORK ARE FACING THAT TOUGH DECISION. BETWEEN MISSING A PAYCHECK OR LOSING THEIR JOBS OR ALTERNATIVELY COMING IN SICK WITH A COLD IT IN SPREADING IN THEIR WORKPLACES AND LET'S BE CLEAR AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES DESCRIBED MANY OF THESE WORKERS ARE FRONT LINE THEIR LOW INCOME AND THEY NEED THIS JOB RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO ENACTED POLICY AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE FOR LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. ABOUT HOW TOUGH IT IS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING THEY ARE BARELY HANGING ON MANY SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE IN FACT GONE UNDER- AND TO ADD ON MORE BURDENS TO SMALL BUSINESSES- JUST IS ANOTHER IT'S A BIG BLOW RIGHT NOW AND SO- I WAS TORN ON THIS BUT I DID SUPPORT IT IN COMMITTEE I WILL SUPPORT IT AGAIN TODAY- I WAS HEARTENED TO LEARN ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAD MADE I KNOW THIS WAS THE PRODUCT OF A LOT OF HARD WORK IN NEGOTIATION. I WAS ALSO VERY PLEASED TO LEARN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COVER ONE TO ONE I'M A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE COSTS INCURRED BY BUSINESSES IN THESE TWO THINGS KIND OF TOOK THIS IN IN FAVOR OF AN AYE VOTE SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES AND I VOTE ON THIS. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MATT JUST WENT AWRY A BUSINESS OWNER AND SEVEN WHO TALKS TO SMALL BIZ OWNERS EVERY DAY BOB BE OPPOSING THIS IS THIS GIVES YOU TAX. AND I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY'S AWARE BUT YOU A TAX CUTS ONLY GOOD IF YOU MAKE MONEY. THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU DON'T MAKE MONEY YOU DON'T NEED A TAX CREDIT BECAUSE YOU DON'T PAY TAXES IF YOU LOSE MONEY. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE. HAVE PUT THEIR LIFE SAVINGS INTO JUST STAYING ALIVE. AND LOOK I HAVE EMPLOYEES IN AND WE WERE CLOSE WITH THEM AND IF ONE WAS SICK FROM YOU KNOW THERE THERE WAS THERE WAS LOANS FOR PP THERE WAS LOANS BUT THAT'S TO KEEP THEM SAFE. I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH IT THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS OUT THERE THAT ARE GOING TO ARE GOING TO AT THIS IS RETROACTIVE. BY THE WAY SO THAT MEANS YOU PAID OUT. BEFORE YOU GET IT BACK IF YOU MAKE MONEY. AND THERE'S A HOT THERE'S A- I WATCHED WHICH ARE. THIS THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE ARE ON A SHOESTRING RIGHT NOW SO I WAS LIKE YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE MONEY FOR TAX CUTS EVER GET TO YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SENATOR ROB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO TRY TO CORRECT THE BUT APPEARS TO BE A MISUNDERSTANDING HERE ON THE FLOOR. AS TO THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE BILL AND SOME OF YOU KNOW I ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT THE FUNDING WHEN THIS BILL WAS FIRST. OPERA BUT THIS ISSUE WAS FIRST PROPOSED. IN THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS A PAYROLL TAX CREDIT THOSE OF YOU WHO DO HAVE BUSINESSES KNOW THAT THE RECORDER YOU REMIT PAYROLL TAXES TO. AMONG OTHERS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH YOUR PAYROLL TAX RETURNS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. AND THE BILL AND THE LEAVE IS FUNDED THROUGH THE PAYROLL TAX CREDIT SO IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE LEAVE THAT ATTACH IS TO YOUR BUSINESS BECAUSE EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING IT THE COST OF THAT LEAVE IS DEDUCTED FROM THE PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY THAT YOU OWE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THAT QUARTER. IT IS NOT AN INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH OF COURSE WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL BUSINESS PARTICULARLY IN A COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHERE THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT. SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE ANY INCOME. AND MANY OF THEM HAVE IF NOT MOST OF THEM HAVE INCOME TAX LOSSES BUT REMEMBER THIS IS A QUARTERLY PAYROLL TAX RETURN ISSUE. IT'S HANDLED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND YOU DO NOT PAY THE GOVERNMENT IF YOU'RE PUTTING THAT MONEY TO YOUR EMPLOYEES SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HOPE THAT CORRECTS THE MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE FLOOR. SENATOR DODD. YEAH I JUST WANT RIGHTS- IN CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE- WE LOOK AT THIS BILL EARLY ON AND THAT WAS A REAL CONCERN ADD TO A NUMBER OF US IN WE DID FIND OUT THAT THE PAYROLL TAXES YOU CAN TAKE THE PAYROLL TAXES CORRECT CREDIT PAYROLL TAXES THAT ALLEVIATED BIG PROBLEM- IN MY MIND THE SECOND THING ABOUT THE PAGA HILL ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IS THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO CURE AND THAT THE ULTIMATELY THE RIGHT TO CURE ISN'T WHEN THIS BILL PASSES THE RIGHT TO CURE IS. WHEN YOU GET A COMPLAINT. WHEN AND IF YOU GET A AS EVEN. AGAIN YOUR BIZ AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT CLOSE STARTS. TICKING FROM THAT POINT IN TIME. IS THIS THE BUSINESS LIKE SCHOOL BILL IS THE BEST BILL THAT WE'VE EVER PRODUCED OUT OF THIS HOUSE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. BUT I THINK THIS IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN TWO. MANY MANY ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD TO TRY TO CRAFT THE BEST. POSSIBLE LEGISLATION HERE I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY- YOUR HAT OFF TO- OUR BUDGET TEAM AND STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOOK. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE YES SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE A PARLIAMENTARY ENQUIRING ON THIS BILL I NOTICED US SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY FIVE- IS AUTHORED ON FILE I'LL FOURTEEN BY SENATOR SKINNER IF YOU FLIP THROUGH THE OUR FILE AND GO TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THIRTY SIX I BELIEVE. THEY HAVE AB EIGHTY FOUR WHICH IS AUTHORED BY THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO THE QUESTION IS THIS- POLICY- BILL OR IS THIS A BUDGET BILL BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF BUDGET BILLS BETTER BUDGET BILLS NEED TO BE AUTHORED BY THE BUDGET IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE MIGHT BE IN VIOLATION OF THE JOINT RULES THAT STATE THAT BUDGET BILLS MAY ONLY BE AUTHORED BY THE SENATE. COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW. THE ANSWER IS THAT THIS IS- THIS IS A BUDGET BILL. AND THIS WAS INTRODUCED BEFORE THE COMMITTEES WERE ESTABLISHED AND THAT HEADING IS- IT WAS NOT CHANGED IN THE AND IN THE ASSEMBLY IT THIS IS A BUDGET BILL. LEON I RAISE THIS OF CARLA BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO REVIEW WHAT WE'RE DOING ON POLICY ISSUES AND WHEN WE- ARE KIND OF SIDESTEPPING I UNDERSTAND WHEN THE QUILL BID- SITUATION. BUT I WOULD NORMALLY MOVE ON THAT WE TAKE THIS THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF THE VIOLATION OF THE JOINT RULES THAT WE STILL OPERATE UNDER ADOPTED LAST YEAR AND NOT CHANGE THIS YEAR. DUE TO THE TIMING THAT WE HAVE ON ALL OUR COMMITTEES I'M GOING TO PASS THIS TIME WHAT I WOULD ASK THE IN THE FUTURE THAT WE FOLLOW THE RULES AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THAT THIS BODY IS ALERTED TO THAT. AT THAT MOMENT BECAUSE WHAT ARE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM- SITTING. IN FRONT OF ME. HE MENTIONED THAT THE IS A- IS WE CAN. TO DEBATE ON THIS FLOOR IS PAULA. THAT IS BEING PUT THROUGH A BY BILL A TRAILER BILL AND WE WILL GET INTO THAT LATER IN THE SET. AND I THINK THE- MIDDLE THE POWER. I UNDERSTAND WE ARE OPERATING UNDER COALBED WE'RE MAKING EXCEPTIONS AND I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE VERY CLEAR. BECAUSE WHEN WE GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS. ESPECIALLY ON A BILL LIKE THIS IS VERY CONTROVERSIAL VERY IMPACTFUL TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE PEOPLE THAT GENERATE THE REVENUES THAT RUN THIS WHOLE SHOW. ARE THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. SO WITHOUT- JUST CLOSE MY REMARKS BUT IT'S A- I'D LIKE IT NOTED ON THE RECORD THAT GOING FORWARD WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WHEN WE'RE DOING POLICY ON WHAT WE'RE DOING BUDGET AND WHERE THEY MATCH. THANK YOU. SO NOTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR COMMENT- ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION BY SAYING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR. SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM FOR. A MEMBER. ARE I CERTAINLY DEBATE ON IN BILL STAND UP OR OBJECTS TO A BILL HOWEVER I THINK IT IS A PRO TO SET RECORDS STE ST A SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. NUMBER ONE. THE FEDERAL PAYROLL TAX CREDIT AND YOU KNOW THAT IN MY OPENING REMARKS I REFERRED TO A PAYROLL TAX CREDIT THIS IS NOT JUST ANY TAX CREDIT THIS IS A PAYROLL TAX CREDIT AND THUS WHETHER YOU GENERATE REVENUE OR NOT IF YOU HAVE A PAYROLL YOU DO PAY QUARTERLY PAYROLL TAXES AND SO IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO TAKE A CREDIT ON THOSE PAYROLL TAXES AND IT IS WHY IT IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO NON PROFITS NONPROFITS DON'T GENERATE REVENUE. SO IF IT WERE SOME OTHER KIND OF TAX CREDIT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS HOWEVER THIS IS APPLICABLE TO NONPROFITS SECONDARILY D. FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DOES PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN PER DAY. FOR LEAVE RELATED SELF CARE IN OTHER WORDS IF THE PERSON THEMSELVES HAS COVERED. MUST BE QUARANTINE FOR COVERED. OR HEAD NEEDS THE BACK TO POINT WORSE REACTING TO THE VACCINE SO ANY SELF CARE. PROVIDES THE FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN PER DAY TAX CREDIT WHICH COVERS ALL EMPLOYEES. SIXTY DOLLAR PAID SIXTY BUCKS AN HOUR OR LOWER. AND WILD YES THERE ARE SOME EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A HIGHER WAGE THAN SIXTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. IT IS FEW. THE PRIME THE MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVED. SIXTY BUCKS OR LESS FAR LESS AN HOUR- THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT TRIGGER PACK A VIOLATIONS EMPLOYEES WOULD HAVE TO FILE FOR BACK WAGES IN WHICH IN ORDER TO UP TO UTILIZE THIS SAFER JANUARY OR FEBRUARYAND IN WHICH CASE BUSINESSES AND HAVE A CHANCE. TO PAY AND TO S. THE SENATOR FROM NEW POINTED OUT. THE WAGED. IN THE FULL PERIOD FOR WHEN THE BILL BECOMES EFFECTIVE. IT IS ONLY INSTANCES WHERE BUSINESSES DO NOT PAY WAGES RIGHTFULLY BOAT. THAT THERE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO A PACKAGE POINT TO A DOES NOT TRIGGER PACK VIOLATIONS- ADDITIONALLY AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN THE FOOD SECTOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE BILL JUST PASSED LAST YEAR ALSO APPLIED RETROACTIVELY AND IT DID NOT RESULT IN THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE CITED. ON THIS FLOOR. SO WITH THAT I HOPE THAT YOU REALIZE THAT THIS IS. A VERY SOUND POLICY AND IF ANYTHING ONE COULD INDICATE THAT GIVEN IF WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC WHICH WILL ONLY BE CONTAINED IF WE CAN CONTAIN THE SPREAD. AND THE ABSOLUTELY BEST WAY TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD BEYOND THE FACT OF WEARING MASKS AS WE ARE. KEEPING OUR DISTANCE IS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE CODED. OR WHO ARE ASYMPTOMATIC WITH CODE ARE NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO WORK SPREADS THE DISEASE SO IT IS IN. IT IS FOR US TO GET THIS PAN CONTAIN. SO THAT ARE GOINGTO BE FULLY RE. AND WE CAN RETURN TORN BUSINESS BUT UNTIL WE DO SO. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO. FUNCTION AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST SO ENSURING THAT WORKERS DO NOT GO TO WORK. WHEN THEY ARE SICK AND CAN SPREAD COBIT IT'S IMPORTANT SO IF ANYTHING WE HOPE THAT EMPLOYERS. UP TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WHILE THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATED WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BECAUSE WE HOPE THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES ALSO DO NOT GO TO WORK WHEN THEY COULD SPREAD COPAYS. AND WITH THAT I ASK YOUR ABOUT. SENATORS WE WILL GO THROUGH THE ROLL CALL ONE TIME AND PLACE THE MEASURES ON CALL. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN FIVE ARCHULETA I ATKINS AYE BATES. NO BAKER.

SENATE RESOLUTION TWELVE BY MEN RELATIVE TO HATE CRIMES CENTERMAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES NUMBERS TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. I PERCENT SENATE RESOLUTION TWELVE WHICH CAN DAMAGE THE IMPORTANT HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND ASKS THIS BODY TO ENSURE THAT API'S FEEL SAFE AND WELCOME IN THE STATE. TWO NIGHTS AGO WE SAW YET ANOTHER INCIDENT OF HATE AGAINST API SAYS EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE LATEST INCIDENTS OF GUN VIOLENCE THIS ONE TARGETED ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN. I LEARNED ABOUT THIS MASSACRE AS I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF PRESENTING A GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION BILL BEFORE THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. HOURS AFTER I PRESENTED THIS RESOLUTION S. R. TWELVE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. NOW HE'S- A CLEAR THAT ENTIRE EIGHTY I HATE IS NOT NEW TO AMERICA OR EVEN CALIFORNIA BUT GOES BACK TO THE HISTORY OF ASIAN IMMIGRATION. LONG AGO ASIAN AMERICANS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE YELLOW PERIL RHETORIC OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. ACCOMPANIED BY A WIDE ARRAY OF HATEFUL AND VIOLENT ACTS. API'S WERE SUBJECTED TO GROSSLY DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS. FOR OVER A CENTURY AFTER THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OR ADAPTED EXTENSIVELY PROTECTING THE EQUAL RIGHTS OF ALL THOSE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY. ASIAN AMERICANS WERE RESTRICTED FROM IMMIGRATING TO THIS COUNTRY. AND THOSE ALREADY HERE UNABLE TO COME CITIZENS VOTE SERVE ON JURIES OR MANY STATES EVEN PURCHASE PROPERTIES. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE MARK THE SEVENTY NINE AND- OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER NINE OH SIX SIX. WHICH AUTHORIZES THE INTERNMENT OF JAPANESE AMERICANS THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL ACTIONS OF THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE ON OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE RESTRICTIONS ON ASIAN IMMIGRATION WERE LIFTED. MY PARENTS WERE PART OF THAT POST SIXTY FIVE WAVE OF ASIAN IMMIGRATION THAT BROUGHT SO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS TO THIS COUNTRY. AND TODAY WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE ASIAN AMERICANS IN MANY WAYS SEEMINGLY HAVE ACHIEVED SUCCESS. API'S ARE LEADERS IN BUSINESS LABOR FINANCE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY ACADEMIA POLITICS. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT FOR A COMMUNITY WHEN CONNELLY HARRIS BECAME THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN ELECTED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. AND ASIAN MOVIE PARASITE WON BEST PICTURE LAST YEAR AND AN AMERICAN MOVIE ABOUT ASIAN. IMMIGRANT FAMILY. WAS NOMINATED FOR SIX OSCARS THIS YEAR INCLUDING BEST PICTURE. BUT THE STATE THE OBVIOUS FOR ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS NOW IS A TIME OF INCREDIBLE UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR. AND THAT IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT. IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE PAST PRESENT UNITED STATES DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MUSLIM AMERICANS WITH THE TRAVEL BAN THEY CAN'T FAMILIES APART. THREATEN TO REVOKE THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP THAT GUARANTEE SO MANY API'S ARE BASIC RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SCAPEGOAT ASIAN AMERICANS AS THE COST OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RHETORIC BLAMING CHINESE AMERICANS FOR THE CROWN OF OURS HAS COINCIDED WITH AN ALARMING SURGE IN ANTI API HATE CRIMES. ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE'VE SEEN VIOLENT ATTACKS AND OTHER OUTRAGEOUS INCIDENTS OF RACISM DIRECTED AGAINST API'S INCLUDING MANY HERE IN THIS STATE. WE SAW THAT MAN VISA RODHAM BUT OF POVERTY- THE TIME IN EIGHTY FOUR YEARS OLD PUSH TUESDAY WILL WALK. INSTANCES THREE ELDERLY. NECK DAY OR IN OAKLAND SKY THIS. I JUST YES AND CHIU WOMAN WAS ASSAULT IN SAN FRANCISCO. IN MY HOME AREA ORANGE COUNTY MAY HAVE SEEN WILL BE THAT API WE BEING SO AT. CALLED THE CHINA VIRUS AND BEING TOLD TO GO BACK TO THEIR COUNTRIES. YOU MAY HAVE READ ABOUT THE C. FAMILY WHICH HAS BEEN HARASSED EVERY NIGHT FOR FIVE MONTHS AT THEIR NEW HOME IN LADERA RANCH. WITH RACIALLY TARGETED INCIDENTS. AND OF COURSE TWO NIGHTS AGO WE SAW. SIX ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN MURDERED BY MEN WHO BLAME THEM FOR HIS OWN DEFICIENCIES. THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT IS. NOT AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC OF HATE. NEARLY ONE IN THREE ASIAN AMERICANS REPORT HAVING BEEN SUBJECTED TO DISCRIMINATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT RELEASED YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS AGO FROM STOP áP I HATE. NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED HATE INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS SINCE THE START OF PANDEMIC. API'S ARE BEING ACCOSTED HER RASCOFF ON SPEED ON. A SALTY AND YES MURDERED. WE ARE. WE'RE SCARED OR ANGRY AND MANY API DO NOT FEEL WELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY WE CALL HOME. AND FRANKLY WE'RE TIRED OF BEING ALONE IN THIS FIGHT WE'RE TIRED OF BEING THE INVISIBLE MINORITY WE WANT TO BE SEEN AND HEARD AND VALIDATED AND WE NEED YOUR VOICES THE VOICES THE STATE LEGISLATURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO STAND WITH US LOUDLY AND FIRMLY AND TELL US. AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS YOU ARE WELCOME AND CHERISHED YEAR AND WE HAVE YOUR BACK BECAUSE OF ASIAN AMERICANS DO NOT FEEL WELCOME HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONTINENTAL STATE WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER INVITES FOR SENATE OF API'S THEN WE'RE WE HE WELCOME. NO I WANNA REMARK ON THE ROOF. OF IT WENT TO EVERY LAWN FOR. TO THE- TO DAYS AGO- BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOME. AND KRISTA. THE FEELING THAT MANY YEARS AMERICANS- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE LONG. DESCRIBE THIS AS A BAD DAY- AND DISMAY ANY RACIAL MOTIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SHOOTER WAS CLEARLY TARGETING API WOMEN. THIS RHETORIC FOCUSED ON THE BADLY THE SHOOTER AND IGNORING THE LIVES OF THE VICTIMS DEMEANS US NOR IS US AND IF THE VICTIMS THE FAMILIES THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEVASTATED. AND WE'RE TIRED OF BEING INVISIBLE. OUR LIVES HAVE WORTH AND MEANING AND VALUE AND WE WANT THAT TO BE RECOGNIZED BY OUR SOCIETY. I WANT TO BE CLEARED API COMMUNITIES NOT THE ONLY COMMUNITY THAT'S EXPERIENCED RACISM AND HATE IN RECENT YEARS. THE ALARMING RISE OF WHITE NATIONALISM HAS COINCIDED WITH AN INCREASE IN HATE DRIVEN ATTACKS ON A NUMBER OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. WE'VE SEEN MUSLIMS JEWS LGBTQ AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND MANY OTHERS TARGETED. AND SO I WANT TO SAY I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE API COMMUNITY BY THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. SUPPORT MATTERS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF WE COME TOGETHER WE OUTNUMBER THEM BY A LOT. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN OUR CORE VALUES OF LOVE. UNITY AND DIVERSITY INCLUSIVITY. MORE THE BOSTON THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN HATE AND DIVISION AND RACISM AND I BELIEVE WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY AND VOICE OUR SUPPORT WILL DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF THE RACISTS AND HATERS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ARE NOT HEARING THOSE VOICES RIGHT NOW. WE FEEL ALONE WE FEEL MARGINALIZED WE FEEL INVISIBLE AND SO S. R. TWELVE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS RECTIFYING THAT WE NEED TO PASS THIS TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE ASIANS YOUR ASIAN AMERICAN CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FEEL LIKE WE HAVE DELEGATION AND WORTH. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I'VE OF. SENATOR- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN AND THANK TO COLLEAGUE FROM- OF FOR FORTH IS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. EARLIER IN MY CAREER. IN A DIFFERENT COLOR HAIR I PROSECUTED HE CRIMES. THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW MUCH ABOUT THE GROUPS THAT PERPETRATED THEM. IT'S AN INTERESTING SET OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO COMMIT THESE CRIMES THEY'RE NOT CRIMES MOTIVATED BY AVARICE OR PASSION. THEY'RE MOTIVATED BY THE DESIRE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. THE TERRORIZE THEM. IT ASO SENDS A MESSAGE TO THEIR FELLOW TRAVELERS THAT THAT. THEY HAVE THE GUTS TO ACT ON WHAT THEY THINK OTHERS THINK. AND THEY LOOK FOR SUBTLE IN IMPERCEPTIBLE MESSAGES DELIVERED BY. THOSE IN AUTHORITY. BECAUSE THEY THINK THOSE SUBTLE IMPERCEPTIBLE MESSAGES. ARE WHAT OTHERS BELIEVE. HARD PRESSED UNDERSTAND I THINK SO WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE RAPISTS AND MURDERERS. THEY THINK THAT OTHERS AGREE SO WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT. THEY THINK THAT THERE ARE VERY FINE PEOPLE WHO CHANT. THE JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US. THEY THINK THEY'RE FELLOW TRAVELERS SO THEY THINK WHEN SOMEONE IDENTIFIES A HORRIBLE DISEASE AS THE CHINA VIRUS THEY THINK THAT SOMEONE AGREES WITH THEM. SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE TO SAY WE DON'T AGREE. WE DON'T AGREE MARTIN FOR US TO SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE NOT THE COUNTENANCE THAT KIND OF MESSAGE SUBTLE AS IMPERCEPTIBLE AS SOME MAY THINK IT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A GROWING THREAT TO INVESTIGATE TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE TO ANALYZE AND OPERATIONALIZE SO THAT WE CAN MEET THIS THREAT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RESOLUTION HIGHER G. UNANIMOUS VOTE THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ARRIVES TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE API COMMUNITY HIGH AUTHORIZES THE SENATOR WHO REPRESENTS NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS OF API OUR COMMUNITY- THE HORRIFIC MURDERS OF EIGHT PEOPLE AND AT LATIMES EARLIER THIS WEEK- ARE ONCE AGAIN A REMINDER OF THE RISE IN ANTI ASIAN HE CRIMES VIOLENT HATE CRIMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FIND DETAILS EARLIER THIS WEEK- A MEMBER OF THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY WAS VIOLENTLY ASSAULTED IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO AND WE HAVE HAD A SERIES OF ATTACKS PARTICULARLY ON API ELDERS- IN SAN FRANCISCO IN DALY CITY AND I KNOW AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL THIS IS NOT JUST A COINCIDENCE THIS IS A PATTERN FIVE AND A HALF TO STOP. AS CHIU WE KNOW ALL WELL THE IMPACT OF THE BIGOTRY GO ON. THE MURDERS IN GEORGIA ARE YET IN EXAMPLE. OF HOW HARM WHY. HATEFUL LANGUAGE TURNS INTO THE- VIOLENCE THE TWO OUR CONNECT. AND WE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN. IT FROM RISE IN HE VIOLENCE TARGETING THE API COMMUNITY JEWS MUSLIMS LGBTQ PEOPLE AND OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BUT THIS TREND HAS INCREASED AT A MUCH MORE RAPID PACE DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN FACT THIS WEEK THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE RELEASED A REPORT THAT WHITE SUPREMACIST PROPAGANDA DOUBLED IN TWENTY TWENTY PERMITS ALREADY HISTORICALLY. HIGH LEVELS IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHAT SUPREMACY HIT INCIDENTS. ANY COMMUNITY HARMS ALL OF US AND WE CANNOT BECOME NUMB. TO THIS VIOLENCE THIS HATE AND WE MUST BE ESPECIALLY WARY OF HELL COOPER HAS BEEN WEAPONIZED AGAINST C. API COMMUNITY AND TO DEADLY OX. JUST THIS WEEK OUR FORMER PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN WENT ON TV AND REFERRED TO COVER NINETEEN AS THE QUOTE. CHINESE VIRUS. THE JEWISH PART PRAY TO BE WORK WITH THE API. ONE HATE CRIME AND BUDGET REQUESTS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AGAIN WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE API COMMUNITY ENTERS AN IDLE. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS SIGN HI TO RISE AND THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM IRVINE- FOR INTRODUCING SR TWELVE IN THE SPHERE OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- AGAIN WANT TO THANK- MADE USE HERE WHO'S MADE EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. AND I WON'T REITERATE- WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN SAID IN TERMS OF- THE RECENT INCIDENTS- THE FACT THAT- ON THE SAME DAY WE HAD A REPORT THAT SHOWED THAT. THERE RISING- SO MANY THOUSANDS OF INCIDENTS OF HATE AGAINST- AGI WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- TUBES. THAT TWICE AS MANY WERE AGAINST A WHEN. INTERSECTS WITH THE RACISM INVOLVED AND- FOR API WOMEN TO BE OBJECTIFIED- ED AND HYPER SEXUALIZED IS- SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS WELL SO MANY. ISSUE ALSO FOR- WOMEN OF OTHER OF COLOR AND OTHER RACES AS WELL BUTI DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE FOCUS MY REMARKS ON WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS BECAUSE- MANY OF YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATED IT SAID WELL I WANT TO HELP WHAT CAN I DO. AND SO FIRST OF ALL I ASK THAT WE ELEVATE- IS A PACIFIC ISLANDER VOICES AND STORIES I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- THIS IS NOW OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS SINCE THE- AGAIN THE MURDER. OF EIGHT PEOPLE SIX API WOMEN YET WE KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT THE MURDERER THAN WE KNOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MURDERED- DO WE KNOW THAT. THEY HAVE CHILDREN DID WE KNOW THAT THEY- HAVE- WHAT THEIR LIFE STORY WAS. OUR THE PEOPLE TO US YET. I'M NOT SURE. WE DON'T- AND SO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO WE NEED TO REMEMBER THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS AS WELL. WHO HAVE STORIES. AND RELATIONSHIPS. AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE WE ELEVATE API VOICES AND STORIES. SO PLEASE HELP ELEVATE MEMBERS ARE COMMUNITIES TELL THEIR STORIES. WHEN WE SEE INCIDENTS OR WITNESSED THEM OR- AND OF COURSE WE AS LEADERS CAN ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO THE SAME TO INTERVENE IN THE ESCALATE. SO WHEN SOMEONE ENGAGES AND RACIST REMARKS DON'T BE SILENT STAND WITH US SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN ADDITION WE NEED TO CALL ON COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS TO NOT PLATFORM. HE AND INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE. WHEN DATE PLATFORM THEM TO GIVE SOMEONE A MEGAPHONE FOR THIS THEN THEY ARE ALSO ENCOURAGING IT. SO WE NEED TO CALL ON. OUR TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES OUR OUR MEDIA COMPANY ON MEDIA OTHER TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REDUCE THE- PLATFORM NOT THE PLATFORM EIGHT. WE ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER- NOT FOR PROFITS AND BUSINESSES I WOULD POINT OUT THAT PRIOR TO COPE WITH AS COLEMAN WAS COMING EVEN BEFORE. ANY OF THE OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THAT ACTUALLY API BUSINESSES ARRAY SAW DRAMATIC DROPS IN- REVENUE BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION AND PREJUDICE AGAINST THEM. AND OFTEN TIME EIGHTY AYE NOT FROM NOT FOR PROFITS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ARE SOMETIMES LEAST FUNDED- FROM PHILANTHROPY OR FROM OTHER- PEOPLE AS WELL SO WE NEED TO SUPPORT NOT FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES AND ELEVATE THEM. WE ALSO NEED TO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT GIVE A CALL ACCESS TO SERVICES TO EVERYONE INCLUDING API. AND THAT MEANS LANGUAGE ACCESS WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET AN INTERPRETER SERVICES FOR PEOPLE-ON MEDICARE FOR YEARS NOW I THINK OUR PRETEND FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THAT. BUT THAT KEEPS DRAGGING ON WE NEED TO HAVE EQUAL LANGUAGE ACCESS TO ALL OUR SERVICES. AND I WOULD pCOMMITTEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE ACTION MAJORITY IMMIGRANTS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLICIES. THAT AFFECTS THE API COMMUNITY. SO WHEN WE DONE THE NINE SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS THAT. THAT HAD TO OUTSIZE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER- AS LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY REALLY WANTED AGAIN THANK OF PEOPLE INCLUDING BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO HAS COME TO ME AND SAID WE WANT TO STAND WITH THE API COMMUNITY WILL SUPPORT. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- SO BUT WE NEED YOU MORE THAN EVER NOW. YEAH COMMITTEE NEEDS ALL OF YOU. MORE THAN EVER AND SO WITH THAT I URGE- I VOTE ON S. R. TWELVE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK.

SENATOR MURKOWSKI THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND SANDERS YEAH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAUSE YOU KNOW WE SERVE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT WE COME HERE AND WE WORK ON BILLS SO WE GET CREDIT AND RECOGNITION FOR THAT AND WE HAVE. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF RESOLUTIONS SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE JOINTLY WITH THE ASSEMBLY WE WANT LIKE TO TELL THE CONGRESS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WE SHOULD DO SOME INTERNATIONAL BODY OR RECOGNIZE SOME SPECIAL PROFESSION OR- SOME DISEASE THAT THEY HAPPEN THESE DIFFERENT. WEEKS BUT FROM TIME TO TIME. THE SENATE. STANDS UP AND MAKES A POINT OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE IN IN THE WORLD. AND THAT'S WHAT SENATE RESOLUTION.

WOMEN REPORTED HATE INCIDENTS TWO POINT THREE TIMES MORE OFTEN THAN MEN. WHICH AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO POINTED OUT IS AN ELEMENT OF MISOGYNY AS WELL. I'M VERY PROUD THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS CONTINUED TO TAKE ACTION TO COMBAT RACISM AND HATE CRIMES IN ALL FORMS. IN ORDER TO NOW IT'S MADE OF THESE HORRIFIC ACTS WE HOPE. THAT AS AMERICANS WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND HONOR AND RESPECT ALL PEOPLE INDEPENDENT OF THEIR ETHNICITY THEIR GENDER OR ANY OTHER CHARACTERISTIC THAT RATHER WE RESPECT IN ORDER.

THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT WORK. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A GOOD NEWS STORY AND A ROLE MODEL COMMUNITY ON THIS VERY ISSUE WHO REALLY CONFRONTED THEY HATE AND RACISM THAT WAS OCCURRING ON IN THEIR COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY OF LADERA RANCH WHICH IS GOOD SENATOR FROM IRVINE MANSION DOG AND THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ROSE UP. TO PROTECT THE FAMILY THAT WAS BEING HARASSED CONTINUALLY THEY SET UP A FIVE EIGHT BOB PROGRAM WHERE THEY TOOK TURNS FROM MIDNIGHT UNTIL FROM SIX O'CLOCK UNTIL MIDNIGHT EVERY NIGHT TO STAND GUARD AT THIS HOUSE SO I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE INCIDENTS OUT THERE THERE ARE ROLE MODELS AND I AYE REYES LADERA RANCH. HOUSE ONE OF THOSE OF THIS COMMUNITY OF ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND NOW RESIDENTS THEY ALL GATHER NOT JUST ON THE PHONE SEVERAL INCIDENCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THEIR COMMUNITY THERE'S GOODNESS OUT THERE GUYS IT IS AT WORK THERE ARE ROLE MODELS AND WE JUST NEED TO OUR FEATURE THEM- BECAUSE THEY BECOME THE ROLE MODELS OF HOW YOU CAN INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN COLLECTIVELY AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SINCE SANTA ANA MENTIONED TO US STAND UP AGAINST WHAT WE SEE. ARE AND HOLD IS A MINORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS NATION WHO STILL HAVEN'T YOU KNOW BEEN EDUCATED AND ARE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE BIAS SEES THAT FROM HOW I DEVELOPED AND THEIR FAMILIES I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE THOSE WHO WERE AT THE HEART OF THIS HARASSMENT IN LADERA RANCH WERE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE IN FACT UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. SO WITHOUT- LET US KEEP IN OUR HEARTS AND OUR MINDS THAT THERE IS GOOD ENOUGH THERE ARE GOOD ROLE MODELS AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WE NEED TO FEATURE WHEN WE TALK. ABOUT THESE INCIDENTS THANK YOU. SENATOR WRESTLE. THANK YOU BETTER PRISON CENTERS ARE REALLY THIS I THINK IS A REAL ONE CONVERSATION I HAVE IT AT A PRESENTS CALIFORNIAN AN OPEN WAY I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY PROMOTE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S REPLACEMENT COLLUSION THE STATE OF TOLERANCE TO STATE THAT WELCOMES PEOPLE OF ALL. BACKGROUNDS AND- CULTURES AND RELIGIONS. YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO MENTION AND PUT THIS IN CONTEXT IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY IN THAT BECAUSE OF THIS DISCOVERY OF GOLD CALIFORNIA WAS ADMITTED AS A STATE WITHOUT A COMPANION SLAVE STATE SO WAS ADMITTED AS A FREE STATE WAS BASICALLY THE STATE THAT ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTED TO. THE FIGHT FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVERY AND DURING THAT TIME AND DURING THE CIVIL WAR IT WAS THE NATIVE MEXICANS WHAT WERE CALLED THE CALIFORNIANS THAT WERE ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES FOR THE ENDING OF SLAVERY AND THAT'S WHY SINGLE TAMAYO STILL CELEBRATING CALIFORNIA TODAY BECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY A CELEBRATION OF THE END OF SLAVERY AND THE END OF THE POTENTIAL EXPANSION OF SLAVERY FROM EUROPE INTO MEXICO. AND THEN. FOLLOWING THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF. VERY SAD ACTIONS THAT ARE STATE TOOK. TO ME IN THIS VERY FLOOR THAT WERE SITTING ON TODAY THEY ACTUALLY VOTED TO CREATE BOUNTIES. ON NATIVE AMERICANS LIVES. AND ATTACKS ON ASIANS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO MINE FOR GOLD IN THE STATE. SO THERE THERE IS A DUBIOUS HISTORY AND IN THE STATE'S PARTICIPATION IN INTOLERANCE AND RACIST ACTIVITIES THAT DIDN'T HELP THE STATE BECOME. THE GREAT COMEDY KANEMI IT IS TODAY AND I ARGUE THAT CONFLICT. BIGOTRY HATRED RACISM ARE A CANCER ON OUR COUNTRY OUR STATE THAT REALLY. AFFECT OUR ECONOMY AND JUST SO MANY HORRIBLE WAYS AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING OUR ECONOMY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS HERE. ABOUT SUPPORTING BUSINESS AND MAKING IT EASY TO OPERATE A BUSINESS AND TO HAVE PEOPLE PROSPER IN OUR STATE ONE OF THE CREW. BIGGEST DETRIMENTS TO BUSINESS ON OUR STATE IS HATRED BIGOTRY AND THE TARGETING OF CERTAIN BUSINESS OWNERS BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR THE BACKGROUND. WE'VE SEEN IN OUR VERY STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO CERTAIN BUSINESSES BE PUT OUT BUSINESSES PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND BE TARGETED AND SUFFER DAMAGE AND THEFT AND CRIME. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHO THE BUSINESS OWNER WHAT'S- AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT IF YOU REALLY TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE HEAR THINGS LIKE MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THAT MAY MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO PUT A MEANING ON THAT THAT REALLY MEANS. A HELP IN THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY TO THRIVE AND TO PROSPER AND TO BE ABLE TO START THE BUSINESS HERE. AND NOT WORRY ABOUT FACING IN. CRIME AND- ACTIONS AGAINST HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN REALLY WHAT HELP MAKES CALIFORNIA GREAT IS THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WE ARE THE MOST DIVERSE STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT'S WHY WE'RE THE LARGEST ECONOMY THAT'S WHY WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE BACKGROUNDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS AMERICAN DREAM INTO THE- MATRIX OF. OF THE VARIOUS THREADS THAT WEAVE THIS AMAZING TAPESTRY THAT IS CALIFORNIA. I AM VERY PROUD TO BECOME COME FROM A DISTRICT THAT HAS TO. ASIAN COMMUNITIES ARE SO SIGNIFICANT THAT WE CELEBRATE THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY LIVE MUCH BETTER AND- THEY I DON'T THEY'VE COME TO IDENTIFY THESE AREAS AND PEOPLE GO THERE SIMPLY TO VISIT. WHAT THESE- ASIAN COMMUNITY PROVIDE TO THIS AREA NATIONAL CITY I HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FILIPINO COMMUNITIES AND- IN AND THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AN IMPRINT IMPERIAL COUNTY. WE HAVE A CHINESE COMMUNITY IN MAKING KILEY KINDA COME SPILLS OVER INTO- CALEXICO PUT. AN INTERPRETER COUNTY BUT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GOES TO MAKE IT CURLY SPECIFICALLY. TO TASTE THE FOOD AND TO ENJOY THE CULTURE THAT THE- EIGHT ASIANS ARE THE CHINESE AND THE COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTE TO- THE CITY OF MEXICALI AND IT'S MADE A VERY FAMOUS. AND THAT'S WONDERFUL THING. TO HAVE PEOPLE TO CONTRIBUTE SOMETHING TO THE POINT THAT. IT MAKES THOSE AREAS NOTABLE ATTRACTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CELEBRATE. IN INCOME IN CALIFORNIA CELEBRATE OUR DIFFERENCES CELEBRATE. THE WONDER IT IS TO HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD CONVERGING CONTRIBUTE. TO FINDING NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND BUSINESS AND INNOVATION IN ALL AREAS. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I APPRECIATE THE CENTER- FROM FROM IRVINE BRINGING MEASURE FORWARD PICKED AND WE ALL NEED TO STAND. UNITED TODAY AND REMEMBER THAT WHEN EVER. THERE WAS. A CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA. THURMOND COMING TOGETHER IN A UNITED WAY TO CONFRONT THE EXPANSION OF THE NOT NOT SEE. AND PRINCIPLES IN EUROPE AND- AMERICA UNITED AND- PUT ASIDE OUR DIFFERENCES AND EVERYBODY WENT TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY IN THAT TIME AND IT HAPPENED IN DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE CIVIL WAR DURING WORLD WAR TWO WHEN OUR COUNTRY UNITES WE MAKE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN AND IT'S A TIME FOR US ON THIS ISSUE TO ME GOOD NIGHT. SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE SUPPORTED EACH OTHER WE VALUE OUR OUR OUR DIFFERENCES AND THEY MAKE US BETTER AND I URGE ALL OF US ON THE FLOOR TO TODAY TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF A START TWELVE AND STAND UNITED AS CALIFORNIANS. SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU MANAFORT TEMP- AT I ALSO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS BUT I ALSO RISE AS A SOCIAL WORKER JUST TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENS THAT SOMEBODY CAN THINK. THAT THEIR DISCOMFORT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT. TO TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S COMFORT TO TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE. YOU SEE THAT IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DOMESTIC SOMEBODY WHO ABUSES THEIR SPOUSE. MUST ONLY GOING TO DO THAT WHEN THEY PUT THAT PERSON LOWER THAN THEM WHEN THAT PERSON IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THEY ARE. CAN THEY BEGIN THEN TO STRIKE OUT SOMEHOW TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER IF THEY COULD PUSH SOMEBODY ELSE DOWN IF THEY COULD HURT SOMEBODY ELSE. THIS IS THE SAME THING OUR SAYING INTERNAL- THAT INTERNAL INADEQUACY THAT INTERNAL ANGER THAT INTERNAL BLAMING LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME. FOR WHERE YOU FIND YOURSELF IN LIFE. AND WE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE IDENTIFY ANOTHER GROUP THAT YOU COULD SPEAK DOWN ABOUT THAT YOU CAN TELL JOKES ABOUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND PEOPLE DON'T CALL YOU ON IT. AND THEN WE SEE IT LEAD TO THIS ULTIMATE ACTS OF VIOLENCE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO ROOT OUT AT EVERY. STEP WE CAN. TO BE ABLE TO. TO IF YOU HEAR A JOKE TO SPEAK AGAINST IT BECAUSE THE ACT OF WHAT SOMEBODY IS DOING. IS TAKING THEIR OWN INTERNALIZED INADEQUACY TO PROJECT ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE. TO MAKE THEM OKAY TO HURT THAT PERSON. AND AS THE SENATOR FROM. SANTA ANA SAID. IF WE DON'T SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT THEY THINK WE WALK WITH THEM. THEY THINK WE THINK THE SAME AS THEY DO THEY THINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS OKAY AND SOMEHOW MAKES ALL OF US WHO FEEL THAT WAY. BIGGER AND BETTER. MAKE SAYS WORSE IT MAKES A SMALL. I THINK ABOUT IT THREE SAID WAS LIKE A CANCER I THINK OF IT I'VE BEEN OUT WORKING IN MY YARD IN THE SPRING OF A SPLINTER THAT SPLINTER YOU GET UNDER YOUR SKIN THAT FESTERS IS INFECTED AND IT MUST BE TAKEN OUT. AND WE TAKE IT OUT AND IT'S PAINFUL TO GET IT OUT BUT YOU HAVE TO CALL IT FOR WHAT IT IS. AND YOU HAVE TO ACT. MANY OF US GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN OUR- OUR OUR GRANDFATHERS ARE ORDERED. DADS THEY WENT AND FOUGHT. IN THE GREATEST GENERATION. TO STAMP OUT THIS KIND OF HATRED THAT ALLOWS YOU. TO PUT SIX MILLION PEOPLE INTO A CONCENTRATION CAMP BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS THAN YOU. IN THEIR VERY BEING THREATENED SOMEHOW. YOUR VERY BEING. WE SAID NO TO THAT AND YET WE SEE. IT HAPPENING HERE ON OUR OWN COUNTRY. WE MUST SAY NO WE CANNOT LET THE WORK OF THE GREATEST GENERATION WITHOUT WE PUT AWAY FOR EVER. KEEPING RISING UP IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS A SYMBOL. OF FREEDOM THE SYMBOL OF EMBRACING OF IMMIGRANTS. SPEAK OUT AGAINST. DON'T LET SOMEBODY ELSE'S INADEQUACY. DEFINE OUR COUNTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. R. TWELVE. SENATOR RUBIO. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. HARD TWELVE. I STAND WITH THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE ASIAN IMMIGRANTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. YESTERDAY'S HORRIFIC MURDERS OF EIGHT PEOPLE ARE JUST THE LATEST ATTACK ON OUR ASIAN AMERICANS AND ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. REGARDLESS OF MODE OF THEIR API COMMUNITY IS UNDER ASSAULT. THEY'RE BEING PUBLICLY INSULTED. BEATEN IN THE STREETS. AND TIME BASED ON WHO THEY ARE AND THEIR PLACE OF ORIGIN I SEE MY FAMILY AND THESE VICTIMS AS AN IMMIGRANT I AM HEARTBROKEN TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY. THE DISTURBING RHETORIC COMING FROM THE HIGHEST OFFICE MUST STOP BLAMING A GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS FOR THE VIRUS COLLEEN ANOTHER MINORITY GROUPS CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS NONE OF THAT HAS A PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT'S THAT IGNORANT ATTITUDE THAT REINFORCES THE IDEA THAT THEIR LIVES LIVES WERE EXPENDABLE. AND THAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AN EXCUSE AND A REASON TO BE MURDERED. THIS HAS ALL THE MARKINGS OF AN ACT OF. FEMICIDE I STAND WITH THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE ASIAN IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR MOMENT OF GRIEF AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE HERE AND EVERYONE LISTENING STANDS WITH THE VICTIMS AS WELL AS WE REFLECT ON THIS TRAGIC EPISODE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. TO VICTIMS OF HATE CRIMES AND THE FAMILIES READING. WE VALUE. WE STAND WITH YOU. AND WE WILL FIGHT TO MAKE THE STOCK. I WANT TO DATE THE GREAT SENATOR FROM IRVINE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I URGE YOUR ARTICLE THANK YOU. SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE QUICKLY TO CONDEMN- THE HATRED AND VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY BUT ALSO RISE TO POINT OUT TO- THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE FEAR- I HAD A YOUNG PERSON CALL ME YESTERDAY- KOREAN AMERICAN WHO SAID. I CAN'T FUNCTION TODAY. I FEEL SO MUCH FEAR AND ANGER THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN. AND THERE ARE HE'S NOT ALONE. SO THOSE ASIAN AMERICANS ASIAN CALIFORNIANS WHO WONDER IF THEY'RE GOING TO FACE THIS HATRED AS THEY GO TO WORK THEY GO TO SCHOOL THEY GONNA PLAY NEED TO BE ON OUR MINDS AS WELL AND SO I JUST WANT TO RISE IN SOLIDARITY AND THANK THE AUTHORS OF S. R. TWELVE AND- STRONGLY URGE AND I BOTH. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IN SOLIDARITY.

IF THEY CAME FOR YOU LAST NIGHT. WE HAVE GOT TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY AGAINST HATE. BIGOTRY RACISM MISOGYNY AND SILENCE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT KILLS US THAT IS WHAT DESENSITIZES US AND THAT IS WHAT POLARIZES US AND KEEPS US FROM STANDING FIRMLY AND WITH COURAGE. WHEN MEMBERS. OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN OUR NEIGHBORS WHEN OUR FAMILIES WHEN OUR FRIENDS ARE KILLED OR MURDERED. BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. BECAUSE OF THEIR ETHNICITY BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION. BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER. AND BECAUSE OF SOMEONE ELSE'S IGNORANCE. I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT S. R. TWELVE THANK YOU.
