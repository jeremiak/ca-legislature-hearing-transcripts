I CAN JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I'M GOING TO PROVIDE YOU SOME VERY BRIEF OPENING REMARKS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO THE TEAM TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA A COUPLE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY EXPERIENCING POVERTY. THE SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES THAT CREATE DISPARITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE HIDING FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC LATE LAST WINTER TO THE EFFORTS THAT TOOK SHAPE IN THE SPRING SUMMER AND FALL ALL AREAS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO CARRY OUT OUR MISSION TO SERVE EIGHT IN PROTECT COMMUNITIES. THE TEAMS WORKED AT AN UNPARALLELED PACE CREATING NEW PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES IN A MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SPACE THAT YOU'LL HEAR ON YOUR AGENDA AT THIS YEAR'S- LOOK IN THE PANDEMIC HAS LOOKED LIKE THINGS LIKE READING PROJECT ROOM HE PART OF A ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IN EMERGENCY HOMELESS AID THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MADE AVAILABLE TO COMBAT THE NINETEEN PROJECT GROUP ROOM KEEP THE DATA SUPPORTED OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND OF OUR AND SHELTERED NAPE NEIGHBORS PROVIDING. SHELTER AND WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS. OF COURSE ADDRESSING. WAS A PRIMARY FOR THE GUY IN THIS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION THAT ARE AND SHELTERED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS OF PROJECT BRING HE AND HOME HE PROPOSING A PACKAGE OF INVESTMENTS TOTALING ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO FURTHER DEVELOP A BROADER PORTFOLIO OF HOUSING. UNITS TO END HOMELESSNESS THROUGH CONTINUED ACQUISITION AND CREATION OF UNITS. YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OUR PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISHTHE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM PROVIDING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. ONE TIME DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. THESE TWO ACQUIRE OR REHAB ADULT CARE. THIS INITIATIVE ALSO SUPPORTS THE EXPANSION OF RESOURCES ACROSS THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUUM BRIDLES. AND WE WILL COURSE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR HOUSING SUPPORTS LIKE THE CALORIES HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM AND HOLDS AN EXTENSIVE PRE. ELECTION AND MAINTAIN STABILITY FOR HOUSEHOLDS. IN CALFRESH TO ADDRESS HUNGER ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO QUICKLY OPERATIONALIZE. AND ISSUE NEW YORK RESOURCES LIKE PANDEMIC EBT WHICH SUPPORTED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WHO LOST ACCESS TO FREE AND REDUCED PRICE SCHOOL MEALS. ON CAMPUSES WERE CLOSED AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH. IN OUR BROADER CALPERS PROGRAM INTO THE WORK WE DID WITH THE LEGISLATURE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND CALFRESH BENEFITS TO SSI RECIPIENTS. AND HAVE MORE OLDER ADULTS GETTING CALFRESH THAN EVER BEFORE. TOTALING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY. FRESHEN ROMAN AMONG ADULTS AGE SIXTY AND OVER HAS GONE UP BY ONE HUNDRED AND 35% IN JUST THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THIS MEANT THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC THESE HOUSEHOLDS WERE ALSO ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY ALLOTMENT SUPPLEMENTS. IN TOTAL REPRESENTING OVER ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL. BENEFITS FOR HOUSEHOLDS. I'LL WHEN I REALLY APPRECIATE ARE PART WITH THIRD TO BE TRICKED TREMENDOUS WORK ACROSS. AND THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ADDITIONAL EXPANSION TO MEET THE NEEDS WE ESTIMATE THAT BY MID TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SPEED BANKS. WILL HAVE DISTRIBUTED ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS IN DIAPER ASSISTANCE. AND PROVIDE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN RESPECT THAT REIMBURSEMENT FOR. EXPENSES THE TRAINING TO CAL WORKS YOUR FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA THIS AFTERNOON WE'VE INSTITUTED A NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITIES IN THIS PROGRAM TO ENSURE FAMILIES CONTINUED ACCESS TO BENEFITS AND DIDN'T EXPERIENCE TRYING TO PROGRAM. THIS LOOKS LIKE FACE TO FACE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS BEING WAVES TO ALLOW FAMILIES TO RECEIVE THEIR FULL SIXTEEN DAY ALLOTMENT OF HOW WORKS TEMPORARY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AND FRIENDS. AT PROVIDING HOW WORKS AT DIVERSION AND EXPANSION OF THAT PROGRAM SO FAMILIES GET BBC ASSISTANCE DURING THE CRISIS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS A ONE POINT 5% INCREASE TO CAO WORKS MAXIMUM AID PAYMENT LEVELS EFFECTIVE OCTOBER. LATER THIS YEAR. IN CONCLUSION GOVERNOR'S BAD PROPOSALS LOOK TO MAKE BOLD INVESTMENTS THAT WILL HELP POSITION THE STATE TO BEGIN AN EQUITABLE AND BROAD BASED RECOVERY ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE RESOURCES FOR CALIFORNIANS IN NEED AS WELL AS BOLSTERING THE CRITICAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACROSS THE STATE. AND ON. SUPPORTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES SO GETTING ONE- FREE **** ALL OF OUR PARTNERS FOR THE TREMENDOUS WORK. I WILL THEN TURN TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR GENDER AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. ECONOMY ENGAGEMENT. DIVISION JENNIFER. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER HERNANDEZ WITH A FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT DIVISION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. SERVICES I WILL TAKE ON THE FIRST QUESTION AROUND OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS RELATED. TO CAL WORKS- RESPONSE TO KOBE NINETEEN RELIEF- SO THE FIRST ITEM I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS OUR CONTINUATION OF THE CULVERTS TIME ONE EIGHT EXEMPTION. AS YOU KNOW AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES AN EXTENSION TO THE CAL WORKS TIME ON EIGHT EXEMPTION. WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY PAS THE FORTY EIGHT MONTH TIME LIMIT- BY EXEMPTING ANY MONTH OR PARTIAL MONTH OF CAL WORKS EIGHT. FROM COUNTY TOWARDS AN INDIVIDUAL'S FORTY EIGHT MONTH TIME LIMIT. AND SO THROUGH THIS FLEXIBILITY PARTICIPANTS CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR AID WITHOUT ANY DISRUPTION OF ANY OF THE CRITICAL SERVICES THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND SO- CURRENTLY THIS. EXTENSION IS SET TO EXPIRE ON APRIL THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHEN WE WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO THE CAL WORK SIXTY MONTH TIME LIMIT- AS YOU RECALL ABOUT. POLICY CHANGE ON PLACE YEAR. AND THE COST OF THIS PARTICULAR EXTENSION IS EIGHTEEN POINT TWO MILLION FOR- TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH TWENTY ONE. AND THEN IS ESTIMATED AT FORTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION FOUR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE SECOND ITEM I'D LIKE TO CALL OUT HERE IS OUR EFFORTS AROUND SUPPORTING THE SUCCESS- FORWARD FOR A REMOTE ACCESS FOR CLIENTS AND SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU'LL SEE PROPOSED ITEMS- THAT SUPPORT REMOTE LEARNING OPTIONS. INCLUDING REMOTE ACCESS- FOR- CAL WORKS AND CAL FIRST EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PARTICIPANTS- SO THESE RESOURCES ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO HELP EXPAND REMOTE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES- ONE- PARTNERSHIP THAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO CALL OUT IS OUR WORK WITH CELL AND- WHICH IS- A CELLPHONE BASED APPLICATION THAT HELPS TO PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING- DIGITAL LITERACY AND DIGITAL NAVIGATION INCLUDING- SOME CITIZENSHIP COURSE WORK AND OTHER CIVIC. COURSES THAT REALLY HELP TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND PROVIDE CERTIFICATE OPTIONS- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON A CAREER PATHWAY AND SO THAT'S BEEN A REALLY CRITICAL- WAY FOR CHINESE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS- REMOTE SERVICES AND IT'S CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL IN OVER FORTY COUNTIES- IN ADDITION TO THAT THE FUNDS WILL ALSO BE USED TO SUPPORT THE PURCHASE OF- SMARTPHONES WILL ALSO BE- DISTRIBUTING HOT SPOTS AND- AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO BRENT BROADBAND SERVICES INCLUDING LAPTOPS AND TABLETS. TO ENSURE THAT OUR PARTICIPANTS ARE AGAIN ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING- RESOURCES- PROGRAMS RIGHT AND SO THESE SERVICES WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND- PARTICIPANTS OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD. BEGINNING AND THIS YEAR AND THE COST OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR. I'M IF WE NEED TO IF THEY ARE ANY. AROUND THIS WE CAN GO ON TO THE SECOND ITEM. BUT THE INCREASES REMAIN OR THE- NINETEEN I RELIEF IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS WE CAN GO ON TO THE CASE WITH QUESTION NUMBER TWO. GIVE. YEAH THE QUICK QUESTION OKAY SO I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE BRETT HAUSER TO KICK US OFF ON THE CASELOAD- OVERALL IT WAS SORT OF A DATE AND THEN I'LL DIG INTO A FEW DETAILS. HE'S ME I'M A CHRISTIAN HELP US UNDER MELINDA'S. IF YOU I DON'T FOR SOME REASON I DON'T HAVE HER RAISING AN OPTION HERE SO I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO INTERJECT. I'M YES I JUST HAVE A QUICK ONE HOW MANY- MANY PEOPLE ARE PARTICIPATING IN. THE CHARACTER GREAT. CURRENT. THAT'S THE UPDATE THAT IRAN IS GOING TO GIVE IN TERMS OF OUR CASELOAD. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON BRENT HOUSE OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME OKAY. YES WONDERFUL SO I'LL BE ADDRESSING AND BRIEF- TESTIMONY THE POWER X. CASE FOR QUESTION THE RECENT TRENDS SO BY WAY OF BACKGROUND DUE TO THE INITIAL IMPACT OF COPING NINETEEN ON CASELOAD THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT ASSUMED HOW WORKS CASE THAT WOULD INCREASE IN THE ABSENCE OF REAL TIME DATA EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC WHICH WAS FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND CASES. SINCE THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT ACTUAL CASELOAD DATA FOR JULY TWENTY TWENTY TO NOVEMBER TWENTY. FIFTH OF JULY TWENTY. JULY TWENTY TWENTY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ARE REFLECTING A DOWNWARD TREND. FOR THOSE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF JULY TO NOVEMBER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CAL WORKS CASES THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND WHICH IS ABOUT A 7% DECREASE FROM. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CASELOAD FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND. I'LL GIVE IN CASE OF GROWTH HAS NOT MATERIALIZED TO DATE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS REDUCED ITS- CURRENT YEAR CASELOAD PROJECTION FROM THE- TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WHICH WAS FROM FOUR HUNDRED. FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND CASES AND PROJECTS A CASELOAD GROWTH- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND- EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND CASES. I WITH THAT I WILL SEND IT BACK OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER HERNANDEZ TO SPEAK TO THE APPLICATION DENIALS IN EXIT RATE. THANK YOU BRIAN. I'M TO GIVE YOU TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION DENIALS THE AVERAGE DENIAL RATE THAT WE SEE FOR APPLICATIONS DURING THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS SIXTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S COMPLETE IN COMPARISON TO ABOUT NINETEEN- SO THAT THE TO SORT OF DRIVERS THAT WERE SEEN- AS MAIN FACTORS FOR APPLICATIONS AND I ALSO- HAVE BEEN STABLE ACROSS BECAUSE IT INCLUDED PERIODS. AND SO THOSE TWO ARE- THE FIRST- FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS- WHICH ESSENTIALLY ARE. CONSISTENT FOR ABOUT YOU KNOW GIVEN MONTH- REGARDLESS OF THE PANDEMIC RATE- THE OTHERS SORT OF DRIVER IS INCOME THAT EXCEEDS OUR STANDARDS. AND THE DOCKS AND ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT INITIALLY DURING- THE ONSET OF COLLUDED- DENIALS IN THIS CATEGORY WERE LARGELY REDUCED TO ABOUT 17% OR SO- BUT THEY SLOWLY STARTED TO INCREASE TO ABOUT 25% OF THE DONT. DENIALS IN THE MOST RECENT. SEPTEMBER OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. IN TERMS OF OUR DISCONTINUANCE- OR WHAT WE CALL THE EXITS- FROM CAL WORKS PRIOR TO KOBE THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND CASES EXITING CAL WORKS AND ANY PARTICULAR MONTH AND SINCE THE BEGINNING OF COLLUDED WITH THE RECESSION- WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE OUR DECREASES- IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND EXITS. IN APRIL IT WENT DOWN SLIGHTLY TO ABOUT FIVE- FIVE THOUSAND EXITS AND THEN IN ME- IT WENT- UP TO ABOUT NINE THOUSAND EXITS AND SO BEGINNING IN JUNE OR SO- WE SAW THAT- CASES WERE COMING BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS HOWEVER IN MOST RECENT- THE MOST RECENT THREE MONTHS OF DATA THAT WE HAVE WE STARTED TO SEE HIGHER THAN PRE COBIT LEVELS- OF EXITS AND THAT'S NEARLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EXITS A MONTH. AND SO THEN THE TWO FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS- BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE HAVE- IS THE FIRST THAT YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT ARE EXCLUDED BY LAW FOR REASONS OTHER THAN TIME LIMITS AND CITIZENSHIP SO THIS MAY INCLUDE CLIENTS WHO ARE DISCONTINUED AT AS A RESULT OF PERHAPS NOT COMPLETING THEIR REDETERMINATION REQUIREMENTS RIGHT- THAT TENDS TO BE THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR DISCONTINUING- INCREASE OVER TWO MONTHS- COUNTY FOR ABOUT HOWEVER WE DID SEE THIS PARTICULAR ITEM DECREASE. DRAMATICALLY TO ABOUT 8% IN MAY OF LAST YEAR- BEFORE IT NEARLY- FOR GOING UP AGAIN I TO ABOUT TWENTY- THE OTHER FACTOR THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS DRIVING THE EXITS IS- EXCESSIVE INCOME AND SO- THIS TYPICALLY IS A FACTOR FOR DISCONTINUANCE- AND YOU KNOW IT SORT OF HAS. HAS BETWEEN OF LAST YEAR THROUGH NO. OF LAST YEAR RANGING ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT. 25% 26% IN TERMS OF- IT'S CAUSING DISCONTINUANCE THIS CONTINUANCES OR EXITS- IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OR PERHAPS YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE RECEIVING OTHER BENEFITS OR OTHER PENSION- INCREASES- IN THAT PARTICULAR LINE ITEM WE SAW THAT- INCREASE FROM ABOUT TWENTY. PERCENT 237% SO DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE THERE AND CONTRIBUTING TO EXITS ON THE OTHER IS EARNINGS AND SO- WHAT WE SAW IS THAT IT WENT FROM ABOUT 80% 265% DURING THE- EARLY CODE MONTHS- AND BY JUNE OR SO LAST YEAR OUR RATIOS HAD RETURNED. TO PRE COOKED AMOUNTS AND HAVE STAYED. STEADY FOR THE MOST PART SINCE THAT. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD ASK ARE WE SEEING SIMILAR THINGS IN OTHER STATES RIGHT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN THIS HUGE PANDEMIC IT'S AN ECONOMIC CRISIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YET OUR CASELOADS ARE DOWN SO WHERE. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE GOING. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION UNFORTUNATELY I THINK AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL A LOT OF THE TICKET HAS BEEN DELAYED- CFN ASKED- FOR. SORT OF UPDATES FROM OTHER STATES- WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY TRIED O. REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH OTHER STATE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE KIND OF PROGRAM- BUT WE DON'T HAVE SOLID DATA THAT WE CAN POINT POINT TWO. ON THE OTHER RESOURCE THAT WE CAN GO TO IS- THAT MUCH A PROBLEM POLICY PROJECTS SO. WE CAN FOLLOW UP AND PROVIDE YOU WITH. ANY INFORMATION WE RECEIVE BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT AT THIS TIME IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE AND IS YOUR YOUR PLAN TO DO MORE TELEPHONIC AND- PHONES AND- DEVICES IS THAT. AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. IN TERMS OF ACCESSING REMOTE SERVICES YES WHAT WE SAW IS THAT BEING ABLE TO PIVOT AND PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW THEM TO- ONE CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED BUT ALSO- ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO- GIVE THEM THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR REDETERMINATION RIGHT AND HAVE ALL OF THOSE OTHER- ISSUES. AT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT- DEFINITELY OKAY BUT BUT PEOPLE WON'T HAVE THOSE DEVICES INTO THEIR ALREADY IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TODAY. BUT DO WE HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE SO WE'RE ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED SERVICES OR THE COUNTIES WORKING ON. THEY THEY ARE AND I WILL SAY THAT JUST HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CERTAINLY TRIED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE RIGHT. AND SO- PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS CELL ED PLATFORM IS REALLY PROMOTING- IN ASSURING THAT FOLKS ARE ABLE TO COME BACK INTO THE COUNTY SYSTEM. AND ACCESS ADDITIONAL SERVICES- THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN OTHER PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO CONNECT AND SHARE INFORMATION. ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN- CAL WORKS IN CALFRESH. THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE HAD WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OUTREACH AROUND- SORT OF EITC IN IN IN ONGOING- SORT OF REACH WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUR PROGRAMS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WERE THERE TO PROVIDE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. I THOUGHT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING BUT THIS IS OFTENTIMES THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC WERE BEING LEFT OUT OF THE VACCINE ISSUE WHO HAVE HIGHER RATES THAN ANYBODY ELSE SO. IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO IT IF THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT WE'RE NOT REACHING. AND COULD BE. BUT ANYTHING. NOTHING THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I TOO AM VERY INTERESTED AND- YOUR CONVERSATION WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHER STATES TO SEE IS IF OUR EXPERIENCE IS UNIQUE OR IS IT SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES- I GUESS WHAT I QUESTIONS SPARKED A FEW QUESTIONS- WHEN NOW- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE GET COVERED WE DID COME UP- AND- GET. SERVICE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EVEN THOUGH SLOW EXPANSION ACT EXACTLY EXPANSIONS IN US ONE THE QUESTIONS I HAD FOR YOU IS THAT WE DO PROVIDE A TIME LIMIT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ON CAO WORKS RIGHT AND THEN WE EXPECT THEM TO GET OFF AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE TRY TO GET THEM EDUCATION ANOTHER TYPE THINGS GET A JOB AND- POTENTIALLY THEY- WERE ABLE TO. HOPEFULLY SOME MANY OF THEM WERE ABLE TO GET ONE DURING THE EXPANSION. THEN COBIT HEADS. SOME DOUBT THEY MAY HAVE. BE RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT ARE SO FORTH BUT I GUESS ARE YOU ABLE TO IDENTIFY- FOR EXAMPLE WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE AND FORTY PRIME MANY OF THEM WOMEN SOME WOMEN WHICH WE KNOW HAVE HAD AT A MUCH IGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE RELEASED- CHALLENGES WITH WITH COATED WITH EMPLOYMENT- BASICALLY WOULD'VE LOST THE JOB AFTER THEY'VE RUN OUT THEIR TIME AND THEN- AND THEN I ASSUME THEY CAN'T COME BACK ON RIGHT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. I BELIEVE SO YEAH AS OUR POLL OF THEIR PULL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO BASICALLY YOU KNOW WERE ON. OUR EXPO FOR RAN UP THEIR TIME ARE WE ALMOST RAN OUT THERE TIME WE GOT THEM TO A- DURING THE EXPANSION THIS YEARS AGO NALCO IT HIT. THE JOB THEY GOT THE GUN RIGHT THEY FOUND A JOB IN HOSPITALITY FOUND JOB AND DELIVER AND THEN. NOW THEIR STUCK RIGHT BY I ASSUME RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T COME BACK ON TO OUR X. THAT CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU KNOW THE SIZE OF THAT POPULATION. I'M PART OF THE BEN HOWARD'S IS ADDED TO THEIR FAMILIES RIGHT SO CHILDREN WOULD STILL REMAIN I'M SURE YOU KNOW THEY WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO EIGHT RIGHT- AND IF THE CHILDREN ARE AN AGE THEY LIKELY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE SPUR OTHER PROGRAMS ADDRESS OFF FRESH SO THERE THERE IS NOT SUPPORT TO HELP ASSISTING FAMILIES. DURING THIS TIME SHOULD THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR THEIR LIFETIME ON KALKA BUT IT BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD STILL GET SOME OTHER SERVICES IS THERE ANYWAY FOR AND AGAIN AT IT SYSTEMS ARE UP TO IT TO IDENTIFY HOW LARGE THE POOL OF PEOPLE ARE. BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING SOME SERVICES BUT THEY COULDN'T GET THE OTHER ONES RIGHT SO BECAUSE THE QUOTE DISQUALIFYING I I'M JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SIR STUCK IN THAT. TRAP RIGHT- SO I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION BACK TO IN TERMS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PIECE. AND SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IS- WHAT IS READILY AVAILABLE AND LOOK I SEE WHAT'S FEASIBLE SO WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STUFF. BUT I THINK THE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT IF FOLKS ARE STILL ELIGIBLE IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE PROGRAM. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OF THE POSITIVE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS TIME CONTRACT IT WOULD IT WOULD STOP THEIR TIME RIGHT SO THEY WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL TIME. UNTIL WE TRANSITION TO THE SIXTY MONTH TIME. SO THERE IS- THAT LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM FOR THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERHAPS A TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR THEIR TIME- DAY WOULD STILL CONTINUE TO BE SEARCHED NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I'M I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO- UNFORTUNATELY MIGHT ACTUALLY- RAN OUT OF TIME BEFORE COVERED BUT THEN. COVET OF COURSE CHANGED. THEIR WHOLE CONSOLE. SITUATION RIGHT AROUND THEM SO. OKAY YEAH- ALL RIGHT AND THEN. THE OTHER I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT AND THEN THE RACE MENTIONED- MAYBE. PERHAPS AND I DON'T KNOW AND REALIZE EDIE'S REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE NEED THEM TO DO RIGHT NOW- BUT- ARE WE EXPECTING PERHAPS TO SEE A- AND YOUR PROJECTIONS FOR- CASE RATES- DO WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE- RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT WHETHER THROUGH P. U. A. R. ET DE WHO THAT HIS OWN PLANE IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT AND REASON WE HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. GO TO CAL WORKS AND WIDER CASELOAD IS OUT IS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DID RUN OUT THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BUT THEY'RE RUNNING OUT THEIR APPOINTMENT NOW OR JUST RECENTLY R. VERY SHORTLY AND THEN THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A SUDDEN INCREASE IN OUR CASE LED BECAUSE JUST AGAIN IS THAT AN EXPLANATION WE LOOKED INTO. ALL RIGHT- GREAT QUESTION SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH EDT PRECISELY TO. SORT OF PARSE OUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE. THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS LIKELY PUTTING INDIVIDUALS OVER THE INCOME TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PROGRAM RATE- SO THAT'S VERY REAL SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PROPER MESSAGING. AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS DON'T GET DROPPED. OR LOST RATE FROM TRANSITIONING TO YOU WHY TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR TELEWORK CAL FRESHER ANY OTHER. PROGRAMS WITHIN SOCIAL SERVICES SO THAT WE ARE DOING- I WOULD SAY THAT THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE BIGGER PICTURE IS REALLY TO BE WORKING ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THAT'S YOUR EARLIER POINT AROUND EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING WELL YES PERHAPS FOLKS HAVE DROPPED OFF FROM OUR PARTICULAR PROGRAMS PERHAPS THEY'RE NOT- ACCESSING OUR WELFARE TO WORK BUT WE ARE STATE WORKFORCE SYSTEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CONTINUITY AND THAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE'RE SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO TRANSITION FOLKS FROM OUR PROGRAMS. INTO THEIR PROGRAM SO THAT IS HAPPENING- I CAN'T- YOU KNOW- I CAN'T GIVE YOU NUMBERS RIGHT NOW BUT- AGAIN IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF THAT'S A STRATEGY. OKAY BUT IS A LONG TERM SO APPRECIATE YOU ARE DOING THAT WORK AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IS THAT BUILT IN WHAT WERE THOSE THINGS BUILT IN INTO YOUR CASE RATE ASSUMPTIONS THAT- YOU THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING FOR THE BUDGET. SO IN TERMS OF OUR- BURKE CATHOLIC PROJECTION YES YOU WERE GOOD POINT IN TIME BASED ON WHAT WE EXPECTED- THINKING THROUGH THAT FOLKS WOULD AGAIN AFTER UNEMPLOYMENT RAN OUT WOULD BE ABLE TO. SORT OF TRANSITION INTO OUR OUR OUR CASELOAD SO THAT PART WAS BUILT INTO OKAY ALL RIGHT SO IT'S SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE IN DALLAS WERE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT DATA AND- EARLY SPEED PROJECTIONS THAT WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHAT. IT DEFINITELY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE AND BUILT THAT THIS POSSIBILITY. THIS SCENARIO IN FOR TRYING TO PROJECT CASE RATES FOR. THIS NEXT STEP BUDGET YEAR. YES ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BECAUSE MANY OF THE SORT OF THE BENEFITS IN THE RELIEF COMING FROM THE FED EX. WIVES YOU KNOW MAYBE FOR THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS AND IT'S SORT OF BEEN- CHANGING AND- OUR OUR BUDGET WAS BASED ON THE POINT. IN TIME FRAZIER NO I UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE ME WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE- THE MOVING TARGET AND THAT SOMETIMES A TARGET MOVES IN A WAY THAT WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO MOVE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER WAY BUT- BUT AND I REALIZE THAT THIS IS- BASED ON. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAD AT THE BEGINNING THE YEAR BUT- OKAY AND HOPEFULLY IN MAY YOU'LL PROVIDE US WITH THE NEW PROJECTIONS AND I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT WAS. WHAT FACTORED INTO THAT. AND HOPEFULLY WILL ALSO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT DO BY THEN TOO. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CALL. THANK YOU. THE YOU AS MELINDA'S HAS OR HOW UP BUT- IF THE MISTER. WERE YOU GONNA AND DOCTOR PANTS QUESTION OR UNITS ON THE NEXT POINT. YES RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. I JUST WANTED TO- MAKE A FEW HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON THE- CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED SO FAR BASED ON OUR OFFICES WHERE. WE CAN I CAN I THE WHOLE DO THEIR AND THAT LET CENTER MELINDA'S AS FOR QUESTIONS FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN. FEDERAL ANDERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUICK ONE BECAUSE I ON. THE CHAIR AND DR KING AND ADDRESSED MOST OF THE ISSUES I HAD WITH YOU WE- IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE THERE'S NOT OUR SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO EACH TRACK. OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXITED THE SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT WHY I DIDN'T DID I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. SO IN TERMS OF OUR ACCENTS WE DO HAVE- WHEN FOLKS EXIT THERE NEEDS TO BE- SORT OF. ATTACKING IF YOU WELL IN THE DATA SYSTEM OF WHY THEY'RE EXITING AND SO THE ITEMS THAT I CALLED OUT OR TWO OF THE LARGEST DRIVERS- AGAIN AND WIND THAT PERHAPS THEY WERE OVER INCOME SO EXCESSIVE INCOME AND THE SECOND BEING THAT- THEY WERE EXCLUDED- BY LAW FOR REASONS OTHER THAN TIME LIMITS AND CITIZENSHIP RIGHT SO MAYBE THEY DON'T. FOLLOW THROUGH WITH- THERE WERE DETERMINATION AND REDETERMINATION ETCETERA SO- THOSE ARE THE TWO LARGEST DRIVERS CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXIT. OKAY BUT SO DO YOU HAVE- I MEAN IF SOMEONE. TRACKABLE AMOUNT I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND AROUND OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES BUT I HINK- WE ALL HAVE THE SAME CONCERN WHICH IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T DROPPING OUT FOR REASONS THAT COULD BE AVOIDED. ZACKS THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING IS IT. NO IS THERE A WAY TO KIND OF KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IF IT'S NOT A ONE OF THE KEY REASONS YOU KNOW THAT YOU MENTION THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM WAS THERE AND IS THERE ANOTHER- MEANS FOR THEM TO. TO GET HELP THAT THEY AREN'T AWARE OF OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON YOU KNOW AS TO WHY THEY'RE DROPPING OUT OF THE SYSTEM. YES YES SO- THERE'S A FEW POSSIBLE. SCENARIOS AYE I WOULD SUGGEST SO- AGAIN THIS WHOLE ISSUE- PERHAPS- FAMILIES WOULD COME IN IF THEY HAVE BEEN TIMED OUT. FAMILIES WOULD COME IN AND THEY WOULD STILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AID FOR THEIR CHILDREN- IN SOME CASES WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUR HOME VISITING PROGRAM RIGHT THAT WE'RE PERHAPS. IF WE'RE ONLY SERVING THE CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY- THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO OTHER SORT OF REFERRALS IN IN WAYS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT THEY MAY NEED. SO THERE IS A STCK COMPONENT AS WELL- BUT- AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE AROUND SORT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE TIMED OUT. WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK AND ENSURE THAT DATA WITH YOU I JUST I DON'T HAVE THAT AVAILABLE. AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY IF YOU CAN DO THAT AT SOME POINT AND YOU SHOULD ARE. IN THE FIVE THOUSAND ANYTHING YOU'RE DOING. THAT WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT JUST JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR US THANK YOU- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW MISTER ANDERSON WITH A- THANK YOU- I'M JUST JUST A BRING THIS CONVERSATION BACK TO A HIGH LEVEL WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CAL EXCUSE THOUGH RIGHT NOW AND- WHY OUR OFFICE THINGS THAT. THE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS ABHORRENT AND WORTHY OF FURTHER EXPLORATION ALONG THESE LINES- AS AS WE KNOW HOW WORKS OFFERS IS HIS SENSE TO VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FAMILY SO ENTER THE PROGRAM ARE TYPICALLY. AT THE END OF THEIR ROPES- SO WHILE WE HAVE SEEN TRADITIONALLY THAT CASELOAD INCREASES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INCREASES ON UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH WOULD MAKE THE CURRENT SITUATION WHERE THE CASELOAD IS DECLINING DESPITE UNEMPLOYMENT UNUSUAL IT'S NOT TRADITIONALLY BECAUSE FAMILIES COME IMMEDIATELY TO CAL WORKS. OF FROM LOSING THEIR JOB AND IN FACT EVEN IN IN- TYPICAL SITUATION WHERE A FAMILY IS JUST RUNNING THEIR BASE- YOU I BENEFIT THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD BE NOT INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. WHAT WE FIND IS INSTEAD WHEN THERE IS A COURT. LABOR MARKET AS THEREIS RIGHT NOW. FOR JUST LESS LIKE TO FALL. A JOB ONCE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED YOU LIVE ONCE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THE RESOURCES OF THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES AND THEY'RE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO FIND A JOB IF THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE CAL WORKS CASE THOUGH SO WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. RELATIVELY FEW ACCIDENTS DURING A TIME SUCH AS THIS WHAT IS UNUSUAL ABOUT RIGHT NOW ARE THESE THREE FACTORS ADDED TOGETHER ONE THAT APPLICATIONS ARE ANALYST WORK WITH LOW LEVEL FOR THIS. PROGRAM TO THAT AMONG THOSE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE BEING SUBMITTED THEY ARE BEING DENIED IT AND I'M USUALLY A HIGH RATE IS FOR HISTORICALLY AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE 60% AS OPPOSED TO AROUND 48% AND NUMBER THREE THAT EXITS ARE AT IT HISTORICALLY HIGH RATE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE MANY OF THESE FAMILIES ARE LEAVING BECAUSE THEY FOUND. EMPLOYMENT AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ON THE PROGRAM SUGGESTS THAT THEY PROBABLY DID NOT HAVE A CLOSE ENOUGH CONNECTION TO THE LABOR MARKET BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THAT THEY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. SO IT IS RATHER MYSTERIOUS- JUST WHY THESE THREE FACTORS ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WE DO IN OUR IN OUR MOST RECENT POST ON THIS GO- MAKE SOME EFFORTS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BUT WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. WE THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR OFFERING THE SOME FURTHER INSIGHT TODAY BUT WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH EVEN MORE IN CONTINUE ASKING THIS QUESTIONS AND CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WITH OUR PARTNERS AND OTHER STATES AND WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS OF FOR THE MONTHS AHEAD. ABSOLUTELY I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE USING FOOD BANKS AND OTHER KIND OF RESOURCES LIKE THAT WE KNOW WE KNOW POVERTY IS NOT POVERTY IS INCREASING. AND YET THE POOREST OF THE POOR ARE NOT. UTILIZING THE CAL WORKS OUT. MY A DOCTRINE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN TRANSACTION IF THE L. A. AS PRESENTATION- DOES THE OTHER HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO- AND I KNOW THAT THE FARMS OR SERVICE SEVENTIES OFFER TO LOOK AT SOME THINGS- SOME DIRECTION THAT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND- WE TRIED ENQUIRING I APPRECIATE YOUR BACKGROUND. WE NOW IN MAY ARE THERE THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING TO TRY TO FERRET OUT THE ANSWERS TO THIS MYSTERY THIS THREE WAY MYSTERY ACTUALLY AS TO WHY THIS IS ALL RUNNING COUNTERING TO WHAT WE EXPECT. YEAH OKAY YES- IS A GREAT QUESTION I THINK. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT AT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE SOLID RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I DO THINK THAT- WE HAVE SOME USEFUL OBSERVATIONS. FIRST DATE. OF INCREASE IN ACCIDENTS- IS TO BE A IN PART DRIVEN BY A FAILURE TO COMPLETE PAPERWORK AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE OR TO NOT I COMPLETED CORRECTLY- IF YOU COMBINE THIS WITH THIS OBSERVATION THAT IN THE SPRING WE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED BE DETERMINATIONS AND THAT. THAT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION ACTUALLY RESULT IN END THE ONLY- INCREASE IN THE CASE OF THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED DURING. THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS BECAUSE VIRTUALLY NO ONE EXITED THIS PROGRAM AS LONG AS WE WORK REQUIRING THAT THEY SUBMIT THIS REGULAR PAPERWORK IT DOES SUGGEST THAT ONE POSSIBLE OPTION HERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES OF ANOTHER SUSPENSION OR PRE DETERMINATIONS. NOW WE'RE NOT QUITE AT THE POINT OF MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION- NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FULL ANSWER TO THIS MYSTERY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S WHAT JUST AGREE AND LEGALLY COMPLICATED UNFORTUNATELY THIS RETURN NATION PAPERWORK IS LINKED TO THAT ACCOUNT FRESH WHICH HAS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. SO WITH WITHOUT HAVING A FEDERAL WAIVER THE CALFRESH SIDE IT MIGHT BE COMPLICATED SAID THINK ABOUT HOW YOU DECOUPLE BUT THAT WOULD BE ONE. A POSSIBLE OPTION WE ALSO THINK EXPLORING ADDITIONAL AREAS WHERE. IN PERSON REQUIREMENTS OR OR SOMETHING OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES SOMETHING- DEBTS IN THE APPLICATION OR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS RIGHT NOW THIS IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENTS. CURRENTLY CRAFTING OF FURTHER GUIDANCE ON IN PERSON PHOTO ID REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP IN FURTHER IDENTIFYING ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES- AND OTHER THINGS WE COULD LOOK AT BE. FOR EXAMPLE EXEMPTING- YOU WIPE BENEFITS OR ANY FEDERAL. EIGHT BENEFITS FROM INCOME CALCULATIONS JUST MAKING A CLEAR LINE THAT THOSE WOULD NOT RENDER ANYONE IS INELIGIBLE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO WORTH LOOKING INTO. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY A DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER TENDER'S. THANK YOU I'M SO GOING ON THE THIRD ITEM HERE. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO- TO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE FAMILIES WERE CONTINUE TO BE SERVED BY THE CALVERTS PROGRAM DURING THIS CRISIS- SOME SORT OF GOING BACK TO MARCH OF LAST YEAR ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS WE REALLY DID TRY TO BE PROACTIVE- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE SUPPORTING OUR COUNTIES. TO PROVIDE REMOTE ACCESS TO SERVICES AS I MENTIONED BEFORE RIGHT- EXAMPLES SUCH AS A LEAD AND OTHERS- ALSO DURING THIS TIME WE WERE ABLE TO RELEASED GUIDANCE TO HELP ALLEVIATE AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES- SOME OF WHICH ARE RUNING FROM ILLEGAL CALLED OUT AND THEY REALLY PROVIDED FLEXIBILITIES ABOUT WERE CENTERED AROUND KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE- AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTED THROUGH THIS CRISIS SO FOR INSTANCE. THE FORTY EIGHT MONTH ON TIME CLOCK PIES- WE ALSO CREATE GOOD FOR WELFARE WORK- AND WE UTILIZE COULD CAUSE TO CURE SANCTIONS WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO USE FLEXIBILITY SUCH AS DISREGARDING RECIPIENTS ONE TIME COVERED RELIEF PAYMENTS- OR THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS RATE- AS INCOME FOR. LEGIBILITY PURPOSES AND SO THAT MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS WEREN'T HURT BY THAT ADDITIONAL ONE TIME INCOME- ASIDE FROM THAT THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE PRIDE- TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORTER COUNTIES- OBVIOUSLY IN IN PIVOTING AND PROVIDING- SERVICES IN IN THE- ONSET OF COPING WITH CHALLENGING- JUST TRANSITIONING TO A REMOTE WORKFORCE RIGHT AND THEN IT WAS YOU KNOW COUNTIES FINDING THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE BLUEPRINT FOR SAFE. CONDAMINE AND HAVING TO ADJUST ACCORDINGLY- THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS- WE CONTINUE TO DO OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATIONS AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE CALFRESH SIDE THIS IS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN- IMPORTANT INFORMATIVE FOR US TO HELP IDENTIFY AREAS. WHERE WE NEED TO HELP SUPPORT COUNTIES- REYES CHILD. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER. ASSISTANCE LATER IN THE YEAR IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE RELEASE FURTHER GUIDANCE THAT- AGAIN REITERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT WE PROVIDE IN PERSON ACCESS. TO COUNTY OFFICES RIGHT IN INTO OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND IN ADDITION TO THAT REALLY- ENCOURAGING AND PUSHING THE NEED TO. CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ONLINE ACCESS TO APPLICATIONS AND FORMS ETCETERA ALONG WITH TELEPHONIC ASSISTANCE AND SO COLLECTIVELY- THAT HAS REALLY HELPED MAKE SURE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PERSON. IS COMING IN IN IN PERSON TO SEEK SERVICES AND PERHAPS HAS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT OR WHETHER THEY'RE CALLING IN THAT THERE IS A WAY. FOR THEM TO RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED- TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR THEIR- SUPPORT- LASTLY I WOULD SAY THAT MORE ASSERTIVE COMPREHENSIVELY- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY A GROUP OF. OF STAFF WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS- THAT ARE JOINTLY WORKING TOGETHER TO DRAFT GUIDANCE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THINGS ARE EVOLVING- THAT WE CAN QUICKLY RESPOND AND. AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING UP ANY QUESTIONS AROUND THAT. NOW I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE ALL AT STRUCK BY THE CHALLENGE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE WATCHING THIS AND HOPE TO HEAR. MORE AS WE GO FORWARD. ANYTHING ELSE AND APART A FINANCIAL L. A. O. ON THIS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. BUT THE FOR THAT THANK YOU OKAY. THEN ISSUE NUMBER TWO COLOR GRANT INCREASES. GOOD AFTERNOON RUN HOUSE OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO ISSUE TO RELATED TO THE PROPOSED CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASE SO TO PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL UNDER CURRENT STATUTE A MECHANISM EXISTS SUCH THAT CAL WORKS GRANT INCREASES WILL BE PROVIDED OCTOBER FIRST TO THE EXTENT THERE'S NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IS AVAILABLE AFTER RECOVERING COSTA. PRIOR GRANT INCREASES AND THE REPEAL THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT ROLE IN YEARS WERE NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REVENUE REVENUE IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER PREVIOUS- MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT RULES OR A GRAND CROSS COST THE GENERAL FUND IS REQUIRED TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. AS OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NINETEEN NINETY ONE REAR REVENUE PROJECTIONS INDICATE THERE WILL BE ABOUT FIFTY POINT ONE MILLION AND REVENUE REALIGNMENT REVENUE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE A ONE POINT 5% GRANT INCREASE STARTING IN OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS INCREASE WILL BRING THE MAXIMUM A PAYMENT OR GROUND LEVEL TO EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR AN ASSISTANCE UNIT. OF THREE RESIDING IN HIGH COUNTY WHICH IS FORTY PERCENT. OF THE SHARE OF THE F. P. L. IN SUMMARY THE STATUTORY MECHANISM TO INCREASE CAO WORKS GRANTS EXISTS TO SERVE AS A MEANS TO PROVIDE FOR GRANT INCREASES IN TIMES WHEN- NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REVENUE. ARE PROJECTING ABOVE GRANT CAUGHT FIRE GRANT COST AND THE MAXIMUM FAMILY GRANT ROLE. THAT'S A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T HAVE ANY MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED TO WORK ON- TRYING AT LEAST. BE SURE THAT- NO CALCIUM LEASE I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POVERTY 50% SOME PRETTY LOW BAR BUT I GUESS IT'S AT LEAST WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT FAR. AND APPRECIATE THE WORK- THE IDEA OF A QUESTIONS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THIS BUT SINCE- THAT IS ABOUT SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON GOING BASIS RELATED TO CAO WORKS- AND MAYBE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE I ANSWERED THIS QUESTION BUT- IN TERMS OF I KNOW WHEN THINGS WE'VE WORKED ON IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND- TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SERVE- OF PEOPLE WHO NEED CAL WORKS AND OTHER SERVICES- ESPECIALLY WHEN RECESSION HITS AND- WE HAVE AN UPPER. INCREASING CASES WHICH I GUESS WE HAVEN'T QUITE SEEN YET BUT WE MAY SEE- WAS THE- SINGLE ALLOCATION FORMULA AND I KNOW THAT- THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO WE CERTAINLY WHEN I WAS CHAIR AND COMING UP TO THE FINAL AGREEMENT FOR A MORE REASONABLE FORMULA. SO I JUST WANNA PUT A PIN ON THAT MAYBE SOMEONE CAN GET BACK ON THE MAY REVISE ON ON PROGRESS I UNDERSTAND JUST CONTINUING PROGRESS ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY THERE IS CLOSE TO A FINAL AGREEMENT- AFTER MANY YEARS BUT I DID WANT TO SIR MENTIONED THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- THIS IS A PAST CHAIR JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT WERE- CONTINUE MAKE PROGRESS ON THAT TO BE SURE THAT- WE CAN MAINTAIN THE COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SERVE. THE PEOPLE WHEN ESPECIALLY THIS ONE CASELOADS ARE FLUCTUATING UP AND DOWN SO I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT- AGAIN APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED WORK TO BE SURE THAT- WE CAN TRY TO AT LEAST AT THIS MINIMUM AND HOPEFULLY. WHEN TIMES ARE BETTER WE CAN MAYBE EVEN. SAYS SLIGHTLY HIGHER BAR. FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED SO THANK. YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WE APPRECIATE YOUR HISTORICAL. TALK OKAY. OKAY HELLO ANYTHING. NO NOT ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU OKAY. SHE WENT OVER. NEXT WE HAVE OUR CALFRESH ITEMS AND ALEXIS FERNANDEZ WILL BE COVERING THOSE. EIGHT OKAY THANK YOU JENNIFER AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE TEAM MEETING YOU FOR HAVING ME HI MY NAME'S ALEXIS FERNANDEZ AND I AM THE CHIEF OF THE CALIBRATION NUTRITION BRANCH OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WE OVERSEE THE ADMISSION THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEVEN FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS INCLUDING CALFRESH I'M GONNA START JUST RIGHT AHEAD ON THIS FIRST ISSUE AROUND OUR- CAL FRESHCO RESPONSE. PANDEMIC EMERGENCY THAT CALIFORNIA'S CASELOAD GREW SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH SSI RECIPIENTS ARE MOST RECENTLY AVAILABLE DEBT DATA FOR DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SHOW THAT WE ARE NOW SERVING OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND SSI RECIPIENTS. AS KEN MENTIONED- THAT BRINGS OUR TOTAL OLDER ADULTS SERVED TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND- MORE THAN 1100% INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THE COMING OFF OF THAT CASELOAD INCREASED OUR TOTAL CASELOAD PEAKED DURING JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY I JUST OVER FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS. AND IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THE MOST RECENTLY AVAILABLE- MONTH FOR WHICH THERE IS DATA. COVERAGE PROVIDED THROUGH BENEFITS TO JUST OVER FOUR POINT THREE MILLION INDIVIDUALS. INSURE ACCESS TO FOOD WELL BENEFIT RETENTION AND ADDRESS A BENEFIT ADEQUACY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FEDERAL OPTIONS IN ADMINISTRATIVE OF FLEXIBILITIES BECOME FERMENTED SEVEN ADMINISTRATIVE WAIVERS RANGING FROM REPORTING FLEXIBILITIES WHICH WERE TOUCHED ON TO WAIVERS OF THE INTERVIEW REQUIREMENT. TO ADDRESS BENEFIT ADEQUACY WE'VE ISSUED EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH THE LENGTH OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY AMER TO SEE A LOT MEANS BRING EVERY CALFRESH HOUSEHOLD TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOTMENT BASED ON HOUSEHOLD SIZE SO AS AN EXAMPLE A HOUSEHOLD OF THREE IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING A FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH AND THAT'S EVERY HOUSEHOLD OF THREE RECEIVING CALFRESH SO OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS THE SETTLEMENTS REPRESENT NEARLY TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL. FOOD BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS. IN APRIL WE WERE THE FOR IT TAKES THE IMPROVE. OF EDT ONLINE. WE WATCHED WITH TO RETAILERS AND JUST RECENTLY IN NOVEMBER EXPANDED TASK ALBERTSONS AND SAFEWAY ON BONDS- THEY ARE GOING FULLY ONLINE EARLY THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ALSO DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED THE FIRST EVER PANDEMIC TV T. PROGRAM PDT PROVIDES THE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS BUT MAY NOT HAVE READY ACCESS TO THOSE MEALS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY. I'LL BE TWEEN APRIL SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WE OPERATED WHAT WE'RE NOW CALLING A PANDEMIC AB T. ONE POINT OH THE ORIGINAL P. ETT PROGRAM- AND THE GREAT MAJORITY FAMILIES RECEIVED A STANDARD BENEFIT. OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CHILD. BY LATE SEPTEMBER WE WRAPPED UP- THE PROGRAM HAVING ISSUED PT REFERENCE TO OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN. TOTALING NEARLY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD BENEFITS. AND LATE SEPTEMBER WE WERE APPROVED TO ISSUE AN EXTENSION ON THOSE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED FOR PD TEAM- WE JUST WRAPPED UP ISSUING THOSE ADDITIONAL PDT BENEFITS. TO JUST OVER THREE POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN A TOTALING NEARLY SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FOOD BENEFITS. LET ME ALSO SPEAK TO THE RECENT RELIEF PACKAGE AUTHORIZED IN DECEMBER AS WAS REQUESTED IN THE AGENDA. JUST THIS WEEK WE IMPLEMENTED A 15% INCREASE IN CALFRESH BENEFITS SO THIS IS IN ADDITION TO EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS. AND IS PROVIDED TO ALL GOLFERS HOUSEHOLDS SO AS AN EXAMPLE THIS BRINGS OF THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT. FOR A FAMILY OF THREE FROM FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH TO SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH AN EIGHTY ONE DOLLAR INCREASE QUITE SIGNIFICANT- THIS IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOUGH- WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE ACTION FEDERALLY TO EXTEND THIS- BEYOND A JUNE TWENTY ONE. ADDITIONALLY WE ISSUED GUIDANCE AND WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO EXCLUDE THE FEDERAL PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT. UP BENEFIT BOOST OR THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK INCREASE I WOULDN'T DETERMINING CAL FRESH INCOME ELIGIBILITY. AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WE SAW LAST YEAR THAT THE ADDITIONAL YOU ARE BE PAYMENTS MADE MANY APPLICANT HOUSEHOLDS IN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH EVEN THOUGH FOOD BENEFITS WOULD HAVE PROVIDED AN ESSENTIAL SAFETY NET RESOURCE. BUT WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO EXCLUDE THAT AND THAT WILL BE EXCLUDED AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT NINE MONTHS SO IF THOSE BENEFITS ARE ETENDED- WOULD STILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR CALIFORNIA PURPOSES. LAST WEEK ALL HIGHLIGHT TEMPORARY CHANGES TO OUR STUDENT ELIGIBILITY RULES ALSO IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF THE RELIEF ACT. WELL WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO ROLL OUT THESE CHANGES RATHER QUICKLY TO INFORM NEWLY ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS AND TO FACILITATE THEIR APPLICATION. IT EXTENDS A LIABILITY TO TWO LARGE GROUPS OF STUDENTS. OTHERS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR WORK STUDY AND THOSE WHO HAVE AN EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION OF ZERO DOLLARS. WE ESTIMATE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT HAVE THAT ZERO DOLLAR EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION. AND AT LEAST A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR WORK STUDY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME OVERLAP BUT STILL VERY LARGE GROUPS OF NEWLY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THOUGH YOU CHANGE WILL BE IN EFFECT AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THIRTY DAYS AFTER TO BE EXACT- AND WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MAJOR OUTREACH EFFORTS ALREADY UNDER WAY THEY STARTED. YESTERDAY INSTANTLY. WE ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO ALL THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. ZERO DOLLAR ESE STUDENTS AND WORK WORKING WITH OR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. OTHER THREE PUBLIC STATEMENTS TO CONDUCT ELIGIBILITY TO WORK STUDY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS RECEIVE ME CONDUCT OUTREACH TO WORK STUDY ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AND BECAUSE RUSSIA IS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN OFF ALSO HIGHLIGHT OUR WORK DISTRIBUTING FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDED EMERGENCY FOOD BENEFITS. ALSO THIS IS FOOD DISTRIBUTED THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF FOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO ADMINISTERING THE FEDERAL FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. I WOULD HAVE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN FUNDING BY EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF JUST THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS. DISTRIBUTED AT A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FOOD FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN DIAPERS AND WILL HAVE PROVIDED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT. FOR CLOSELY RELATED FOOD EXPENSES MUCH OF THIS STATE FUNDED- AS A RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION. ON AVERAGE WERE DISTRIBUTING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND TWO BOXES A MONTH AND WE ESTIMATE- WITH CURRENT. ARE SUPPLIED WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO THROUGH APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. LET ME WRAP UP BY SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT'S COMING NEXT AND I KNOW THIS IS QUITE A LOT BUT- AS WE HIGHLIGHTED IN TODAY'S AGENDA THE PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED THE RATE OF FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCED BY CALIFORNIANS. WITH CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IMPACTED MORE THAN OTHERS. IT'S ONLY TOUCH ON SOME OF OUR EFFORTS IN THE COMING MONTHS. WILL BE IMPLEMENTING AN EXPANDED PDT PROGRAM TO SERVE FAMILIES WITH BOTH SCHOOL AGE AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM AND WE ANTICIPATE REACHING AS MANY AS FIVE MILLION CHILDREN STATEWIDE. THE CRITICAL BENEFITS- FOR THE ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR AVAILABLE FOR THE ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS- ESTIMATED PER MONTH IN INCLUDE BENEFITS FOR THESE CHILDREN. WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REACHING AND SUPPORTING A BENEFIT RETENTION AMONG OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AS AN EXAMPLE WE RECENTLY APPLIED FOR AND WERE APPROVED TO WAIVE OR ELIMINATE THE STAR SEVEN WHICH IS OUR PERIODIC REPORTS IN BETWEEN APPLICATION RECERTIFICATION YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A REPORT. WE WERE APPROVED TO WAIVE THAT FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH ELDERLY AND DISABLED HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND NO EARNED INCOME. WE'RE ATTRACTED IMPLEMENTED EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND EXPECT THE CHANGE. WOULD IMPACT OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS A MAJOR STRIDE TOWARD BENEFIT RETENTION. WE'RE INVESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND OUTREACH IN ADDITION TO OUR ONGOING WORK- FOR EXAMPLE REACHING OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STUDENTS ARE TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUTREACH CAMPAIGN AIMS TO SERVE NEWLY ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. SO PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NEVER ENGAGE WITH CALFRESH BEFORE BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY MIGHT NOW FIND THEMSELVES ELIGIBLE FOR EXAMPLE ANTICIPATED JOB LOSS. WE'RE GOING DIFFERENT METHODS TO REACH THEM SO AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE SHIFTING INTO STREAMING MEDIA SERVICES TO TARGET AVERAGE BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH AGAIN WITH THAT NEWLY ELIGIBLE POPULATION IN MIND. WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS JENNIFER MENTIONED WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING CLIENT ACCESS A SUPPORTING OUR WORK FORCE AS THEY PREPARE TO TRANSITION TO. HOPEFULLY POST PANDEMIC OPERATIONS AND INCREASING THE EFFICIENCIES OF OUR ADMINISTRATION SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO EFFECTIVELY MEET DEMAND. JENNIFER ALSO TOUCHED ON IN THE AREA OF EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING- THE MOVE TO REMOTE SERVICES WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY EXPANDED- THE AVAILABILITY OF STATEWIDE PROVIDERS OF EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES SO AGAIN OF PREPARING FOR THAT ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND THE NEED FOR WORK FOR SERVICES. AND LASTLY WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON ENSURING THE CAPACITY TO CONTINUE DISTRIBUTING EMERGENCY FOOD ESPECIALLY AS ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. SO LET ME STOP THERE- AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT WAS QUITE A BIT OF INFORMATION. THAT IS THAT WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION- BUT WITH THE P. D. B. T. ARM. HAVE WE ARRANGE IT NOW SO THAT PEOPLE CAN USE USES ONLINE AS WARDEN HAVE FOOD DELIVERED TO THEM FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DRIVE I KNOW THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THAT BEFORE WE RESOLVE THAT. YES SO BOTH ARE REGULAR CAL FRESH BENEFITS B. AND R. P. ET T. BENEFITS CAN BE USED ONLINE. RIGHT NOW. WE ARE APPROVED- IN THREE RETAILERS SO RETAILERS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR WERE OPERATING AND AMAZON WALMART AND THEN THAT. ALBERTSONS MANLY OF BRANDS IF YOU WILL WHICH INCLUDES BONDS AND SAFE WAYS. SO WE PUT OKAY- AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WAS JUST AROUND. ED WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP IN THE COUNTRY AND YET WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF POVERTY. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE OUTRAGE GONNA. ADDRESS THAT I'M AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION JUST AS AS IT RELATES TO HUNGER. AND FOOD INSECURITY. SO THAT IS THE GOAL OF OUR OUTREACH AND I WOULD SAY IT'S TO PROBLEMS SO IT'S OUT OF REACH INTENDED TO. ENCOURAGE ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS TO APPLY AS A SPOKE A BIT TO SOME OF OUR- TARGET POPULATIONS IN THAT WORK AND RIGHTFULLY- GOING INTO. TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNDER THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION AND POSSIBLY SOME NEW MESSAGING AROUND. ELIGIBILITY AMONG. A NON CITIZENS OR THEIR CITIZEN FAMILY MEMBERS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ON OUR RADAR WE SOLVED IT THERE WERE. A CHILLING EFFECT IF YOU WILL AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAD TAKEN SO ARE OUT OF REACH OUT PLANS DO INCORPORATE THOSE UP GROUPS AND MAKING SURE THEY- I PERSONALLY CALPERS IS AVAILABLE BUT WE'RE ALSO TAKING STRIDES AROUND BENEFIT RETENTION. WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT SO I SPOKE TO THE WORK AROUND OLDER ADULTS AND MAKING SURE THAT ONCE THEY'RE ON THE PROGRAM WE CAN KEEP THOSE CASES FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO AS AN EXAMPLE UNDER- FEDERAL WAIVER THE ELDERLY SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION PROJECT WE ARE ABLE. TO PROVIDE A THIRTY SIX MONTH CERTIFICATION PERIOD WE WILL NOW NOT REQUIRE THAT NEED REPORT SAYS THIRTY SIX MONTHS VERY STABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO IT IS A MIX OF BOTH-THE OUT REACH UP FRONT FOR APPLICATION. AND THEN THE BENEFIT RETENTION WORK. AND NOW I'M NEW TO THIS BUT UNDERSTAND A FEDERAL APPLICATION THAT MAKES THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO SIGN UP FOR CALFRESH AND OURS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CUMBERSOME CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. ABOUT WHY WE HAVE ADOPTED THE- SO. I'M NOT SURE WHICH- FEDERAL APPLICATION YOUR SEATS- THANK YOU- WE ARE APPLICATION REFLECTS FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WE DO HAVE A CALFRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TOOL GET CALFRESH SHOPWORN IT CAN BE COMPLETED IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES WE HAVE SOME DEDICATED VERSIONS SO WE HAVE A VERSION DEDICATED FOR STUDENTS- WE HAVE ANOTHER TOOL THAT ARE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PARTNERS USE SO THERE IS A SHORT. FORM OF THE ONLINE APPLICATION NOW THAT I THINK OF IT I THINK YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO THAT PAPE THE SHORTENED PAPER APPLICATION FOR OLDER ADULTS IS THAT- GIVE STOP. YES YES SO- THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE LOOKED AT AS PART OF OUR E. SAP WORK OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE DID PRIORITIZE THE WAIVER OF THE SAR SEVEN WHICH IS THE MID. REPORT AS WELL AS THE EXTENDED CERTIFICATION PERIODS- AND I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS OVER TIME AS WELL. ESPECIALLY OUR OLDER ADULTS AND OUR OLDER WOMEN THAT WE KNOW HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD HIT. IN THIS. DOCUMENT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I GUESS SO YOU KNOW IT BEGAN TO PREACH IT TO ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT- WE'RE- THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SPECIALLY THIS TREMENDOUS TIME OF TIME OF NEED. YES THE QUESTION IS THAT- WELL. HOW WE MEASURING WHETHER THIS IS ENOUGH I GUESS IS- AND- SO- AND I KNOW THAT THAT THAT CARES REYES REFERRED TO THE FACT OF WE LOOKING AND I'LL IN PASSED COMPARISONS WITH OTHER STATES WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND GETTING PEOPLE ENROLLED INTO CALFRESH- SO HOW NOW WITH COVERT HOW. DOING AGAIN AND PERHAPS IN COMPARISON TO SOME OF OUR OTHER STATES I KNOW CALIFORNIA'S BIGGER IT'S MORE DIVERSE GEOGRAPHICALLY IN MANY OTHER WAYS. BUT EARLY CLOSING IN ON HOW OTHER STATES ARE DOING A GIVEN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- SO IT'S NOT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT COMPARISONS BUT- PERHAPS- CAN YOU CAN YU SPEAK TO THAT. IN TERMS OF- OUR ABILITY TO SERVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED AT WHO NEED IT SO CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT SUDDENLY CAL ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE GET CALFRESH AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO FUND FOOD BANKS BECAUSE FOOD BANKS ARE CUTTING OTHER PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO DON'T MISS NOT ALL YUP NOT ALWAYS PEOPLE CAN'T QUALIFY FOR CALFRESH BUT CERTAINLY A GOOD PORTION OF THOSE CONCERNED THAT WAY SO IT'S A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY. BUT JUST SORT OF. THINK STEPPING BACK- IS THERE SOME METRIC A GAUGE THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO SEE HOW WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY MEETING TO TOTAL THE- YES. SO WE HAVE A CALFRESH DATA DASHBOARD ONLINE WITH- THE MOST RECENT KIND OF CASE LAW DATA DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FOR OUR PROGRAM- AS WELL YOU'LL SEE A FEW MEASURES OF PARTICIPATION. WE HAVE. A NEW PARTICIPATION RATE HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED NATIONALLY SINCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED SO. UNABLE TO THROUGH THE LINK OUR PARTICIPATION RATE TO THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND USUALLY THAT DATA IS UNFORTUNATELY A COUPLE YEARS BEHIND. SO WE HAVE YET TO EVEN SEE THE NEW PARTICIPATION NUMBERS AFTER- WE EXPANDED CAL FIRST SS I RECIPIENTS ARE HAVING WATCHED SOME OF OUR BROADER OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IN TERMS OF THAT NATIONAL TRENDS AS- JENNIFER MENTIONED THE DATA A BIT BEHIND ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. BUT WE ARE SEEING- THAT STATES ARE A LITTLE BIT ALL OVER THE PLACE SOME SEEING AS HE STILL GAINES ON PAR WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED REALLY ON OTHERS SEEING DECLINES. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE PRELIMINARY NUMBERS. WHEN COMPARING SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TO AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY THE CHANGING CALIFORNIA WAS POINT NATIONAL AVERAGE WAS 1% SO NOT FAR BEHIND THAT NATIONAL AVERAGE JUST ON THESE VERY PRELIMINARY NUMBERS WHICH WE KEEP AN EYE ON- TO MAKE SURE THAT- WHAT KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT NATIONAL TREND AND THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AVAILABLE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC OKAY. I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER HAS ALSO APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES AND WE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS TO ACTUALLY MAKE CALFRESH MORE AVAILABLE TO LARGER POPULATIONS HE'S POINTED OUT WITH FAMILY AND IT'S ABLE TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO- PEOPLE ON SSI AND SO FORTH SO- MAYBE IT SPEAKS TO A- OF. AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE A STATE ONLY BUT- PERHAPS THE NATIONAL EFFORT TO FIND WAYS TO GET. SOME BETTER DATA MORE UPDATED AT TWO TWO PLUS YEAR LOOK BACK. AT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE STANDING THANK YOU. AND JUST TO VISIT ONE MORE TIME THE ISSUE AROUND FOOD BANKS AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN SUCH AN INCREASE IN OUR FOOD BANK SO WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY OUT THERE. WE HAVE LOWER RATES OF PEOPLE UP ON CALFRESH SO THERE'S A THERE'S A DISCONNECT IN THERE SOMEWHERE THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH. THANK YOU. OKAY. RIGHT ANYTHING FROM L. L. NO THANK YOU OKAY NOTHING ELSE NOT DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I THINK FOR THAT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WANT ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. OKAY SO I WILL TAKE THAT ONE AS WELL. SO AS DESCRIBED IN OUR HEARING AGENDA- AND THIS IS RELATED TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFITS AND TRANSITION NUTRITION BENEFIT PROGRAMS- THESE TWO PROGRAMS SNB AND TMB FOR SHORT WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH TO SSI RECIPIENTS. THEY WERE INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE HARM OF THEPOLICY CHANGE ON EXISTING CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS WHO WHEN THE CHANGE WAS IMPLEMENTED EITHER AT. A LOSS IN CALFRESH BENEFITS OR BECAME AN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH BENEFITS. SO BENEFITS FROM BOTH THE SMB AND TMB PROGRAMS ARE ISSUED BASED ON A BENEFIT TABLE AND ORIGINALLY THAT BENEFIT TABLE WAS BASED ARE USING IT STILL IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SSR RECIPIENTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD AT THE TIME THAT THE POLICY CHANGE WAS IMPLEMENTED. SO THE PROPOSAL TO UPDATE THE SMB AND TMB BENEFIT TABLES ARE WERE CALCULATED USING DATA FOR ON ARTS SARS OR STATEWIDE AUTOMATED RECONCILIATION SYSTEM PAIN MOUTHFUL THAT IT'S OUR ACTUAL EDT DATA. AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE ANALYZE EACH CATEGORY IN THE BENEFIT TABLE. HE AND POST THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH TO DETERMINE IF WE HAD BEEN CHIEF OUR INTENDED GOAL. OF THEM WE BALANCE EACH CATEGORY INDIVIDUALLY SO AT LEAST 50% OF RECIPIENTS X. THAT- EXPERIENCED EITHER NO CHANGE OR INCREASE IN BENEFITS WHEN YOU COMBINE THEIR PREVIOUS CALFRESH AND SMB OR THEIR NEW TMB- BENEFITS. SO THAT THE 50% THRESHOLD ALL ADD IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF MITIGATING THE LOSS OF BENEFITS FOR THE CASELOAD AND SO THESE BENEFITS UPDATES- PART TO. GET MORE ACCURATE IF YOU WILL WITH THE LOSS OF CALIFORNIA SHE- THAT HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE POLICY CHANGE AND I'M GONNA STOP HERE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT WAS QUITE COMPLICATED I'LL MISS IT THERE ANY QUESTIONS. I WOULD JUST COMIDAS ON WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS- THOSE ARE TWO PRETTY GOOD EXPLANATION THANK. OKAY PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY SO WITH REGARD TO THE REPLACEMENT OF SM BEER TMB BENEFITS- WOULDN'T FOOD THAT IS PURCHASED WITH THOSE BENEFITS IS LOST YOU KNOW WHAT WE REFER TO AS A HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE SO THIS IS SOMETHING SUCH AS A NATURAL DISASTER OR A REFRIGERATOR BREAKING DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY. SO WE DON'T HAVE A CURRENTLY A PROPOSAL RELATED TO REPLACING AS A BEER TMB BENEFITS THAT SAID I WANT TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE AND HIGHLIGHT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS SUCH A PROPOSAL WERE UNDER CONSIDERATION. FOR REGULAR CAL FRESH AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL- THE BENEFIT REPLACEMENT AMOUNT WHEN THERE IS A HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE IS DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF FOOD- THAT WAS REPORTED AS LOST WHETHER THAT FOOD WAS A PERISHABLE OR NON PERISHABLE- AND WHAT TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE IT WAS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR FRIDGE BREAKS WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE PERISHABLE FOODS IF YOU'VE EXPERIENCED A FLOOD WE'RE GOING TO REPLACE ALL OF THE FOOD PURCHASED IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF THE MONTH. BECAUSE WE MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS AROUND HOW MUCH FOOD WOULD BE LEFT AVAILABLE TO YOU- AT THE BEGINNING. OF THE MONTH VERSES AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WE ALL WORK BENEFITS CALFRESH BOTTOM. SO THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON THE TYPE OF DISASTER AND THE TYPE OF- THAT WAS LOST IN THE TIME OF THE MONTH SO VERY SIMILAR. WE REPLACE BENEFITS ON AN AUTOMATIC BASIS. USING A PERCENTAGE FORMULA SO IF UP A MAJORITY OF HOUSEHOLDS IN AN AREA ACCOUNT TO YEARS OF CODE EXPERIENCE HOUSEHOLD MISFORTUNE THAT LED TO ASSUME FOOD LOSS SUCH AS AN EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE. THEN WE'RE ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY REPLACE FOOD AT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. 100% OF YOUR BENEFIT TOTAL. SO WHEN WE ARE REPLACING BENEFITS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE MUST RECEIVE AT THE COUNTY A REQUEST FOR REPLACEMENT USUALLY HOUSEHOLDS HAVE TEN DAYS TO DO THAT WE OFTEN EXTENDED TO THIRTY DAYS- WE THEN ISSUE THE REPLACEMENT AMOUNT BASED ON THAT DETERMINATION. AND WE MUST BE ABLE TO REPORT THESE BENEFITS SEPARATELY FROM REGULAR CALFRESH. WHEN WE REPLACE BENEFITS PROBLEMATICALLY WE DO THAT BY WORKING WITH OUR SAWS ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM AGAIN WE USUALLY USE A PERCENTAGE BASED FORMULA AND THEY RUN A PROCESS OVERNIGHT AND YOU SHOULD THE REPLACEMENTS ALL AT ONCE. THE REPLACEMENT IS USUALLY SCHEDULED AGAINST OTHER CHANGES OR- CROSS THE SEAS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM SO WE SCHEDULE IT BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND JUST LIKE WHEN WE REPLACE THEM INDIVIDUALLY WE MUST BE ABLE TO TRACK THEM SEPARATELY THEN REGULAR CAL FRESH. BENEFITS THE- YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS BOTH MANUAL WORK AND AUTOMATED WORK INVOLVED WITH ISSUING REPLACEMENTS DEPENDING ON HOW THAT HAPPENS SO IT WOULD REQUIRE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE S. N. B. N. T. N. B. PROGRAMS FOR OUR SYSTEM AUTOMATION TO BE UPDATED AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN ISSUE THOSE REPLACEMENT BENEFITS AND KEEP THEM SEPARATE AND APART FROM YOUR REGULAR S. N. B. OR T. M. B. BENEFITS. RIPARIAN OPERATIONAL SIMPLICITY. I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE REPLACEMENT PROCESS NEARER THE CALFRESH REPLACEMENT PROCESS. I WAS SO THAT CLIENTS ARE. BETTER ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT REPLACEMENT IS BEING DETERMINED AND SO THAT OUR ELIGIBILITY WORK FORCE CAN ALSO- GET CAUGHT UP TO SPEED AND NOT HAVE THOSE DIFFERENCES IN PROGRAM RULES. AND THE FEASIBILITY OF AUTOMATING THE CHANGE WOULD OF COURSE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN CONTEXT OF OTHER AUTOMATION PARTIES AND OUR MIGRATION TO COUNSEL US. AND I'M READY TO SPEAK TO THE ASSEMBLY TMB KEESLER TRENDS BUT LET ME JUST PAUSE AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ON REPLACEMENT. I GUESS JUSTIN EDUCATE ME HOW HOW ARE PEOPLE INFORMED THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR REPLACEMENTS. IF IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC. SO UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA- OF THE EXPERIENCE RESPONDING TO WILDFIRES AND DISASTERS HAS ACTUALLY MADE- COUNTY'S AGAIN CLIENTS QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE AVAILABILITY SO. ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE A WILDFIRE IN THE AREA WE'RE COMMUTING KADING THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE REPLACEMENTS TO CLIENTS AND AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY IF IT SOMETHING THAT HAS OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY IN THAT COMMUNITY WHICH IS OTEN THE CASE OF FAMILIES ARE QUITE FAMILIAR SO WHEN THEY'RE- INDIVIDUALLY AVAILABLE THAT'S THROUGHOUT OUR REGION COMMUNICATIONS EFFORT. WHEN THEY'RE ISSUED AUTOMATICALLY WE TRY TO PAIR THAT WITH CLIENT COMMUNICATION SUCH AS OUTBOUND TEXT MESSAGES UPDATES TO OUR PHONE SYSTEM RECORDINGS SO THAT CLIENTS KNOW WHY THOSE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS HAVE BEEN LOADED ONTO THEIR CARD. OKAY AND I AND I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY AROUND THEM WITH THE WILDFIRES AND PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET FOOD REPLACE BUT WHAT ABOUT LIKE. IT DIDN'T IN THE END AND STOCKTON WE HAD OVER FIFTY FIFTY HOURS OF POWER BEING OUT FOR SOME FAMILIES. WHO YOU KNOW ARE ARE YOU WE'RE NOT A WELFARE RECIPIENT USED TODAY IT WAS JUST A BIG. THE OLD TREES AND ABOVE GROUND WIRES. SO THAT WOULD QUALIFY AND I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE INTO THE WEEDS IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME IF THE OUTAGE LASTED FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS AND IT IMPACTED MORE THAN 50% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN AN AREA SUCH AS THE ZIP CODE OR COUNTY AND SO THE PROCESS OF FOR THAT WE MONITOR. THESE EVENTS CAREFULLY AND WHEN WE SEE THAT THERE MAY BE A QUALIFYING EVENT ME REACH OUT TO THE CORRESPONDING UTILITY COMPANIES AND WE HAVE TO SUBMIT TO YOU. DATA THATPROVES THAT FOOD LOSS CAN BE ASSUMED AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT USDA THEN HAS TO APPROVE THAT REQUEST IN DETERMINE TO WHAT PERCENTAGE WE WILL REPLACE THE FOOD SO WE HAVE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH UTILITY PROVIDERS SUCH AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND PG&amp;E- WE'RE WE'RE REGULARLY ABLE TO PULL DATA- AS A RESULT OF. AN EVENT LIKE THAT. THANK YOU. DISTURBANCE OKAY PLEASE CONTINUE. OKAY SO LET ME- LASTLY SPEAK TO TRENDS IN SMB AND TMB CASELOAD SO BOTH- S. N. B. N. T. N. B. CASELOADS PEAKED AROUND DECEMBER NINETEEN JANUARY TWENTY AND HAVE SINCE DECLINED WITH HIM B. PARTICIPATION DECLINING MORE RAPIDLY BEGINNING AROUND THE MAY TWENTY TWENTY MY SPEAK TO WHY THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE DATA. THE SMB CASELOADS TRUMP SMB CASELOAD TRENDS WHERE CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY SO HER S. N. B. POLICY WE ARE ONLY ISSUING SMB BENEFITS TO CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS WHO MAINTAIN THEIR CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY AFTER IMPLEMENTING. THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH. SO THAT CASE FOLLOWS WITH CALFRESH TRENDS AND IT WOULD BE QUITE CHALLENGING TO SEPARATE SMD PARTICIPATION FROM CALFRESH ENROLLMENT AS THAT WAS KIND OF A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION. AB AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT AS WE GET TO A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS YOUR THEREIS NO UNIQUE. RECERTIFICATION OR BENEFIT MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SMB PROGRAM AS LONG AS YOU MAINTAIN CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY AND YOU WORK AT AN SMB HOUSEHOLD YOU'RE ELIGIBLE TO MAINTAIN SMB. THE TMB OKAY SO IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT IT STANDS ALONE AND PER TMB POLICY- TìM BEAT BENEFITS WERE ISSUED TO FORMER CALFRESH HOUSEHOLDS WHO LOST ELIGIBILITY AFTER IMPLEMENTING THE EXPANSION. SO TMB HOUSEHOLD WERE INITIALLY REQUIRED TO RECERTIFY THEIR TMB AT TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THAT KIND OF EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE POLICY CHANGE AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE DATA IS THAT AS WE HAD THAT TWELVE MONTH MARK WE DID START TO SEE. A DECLINE IN THE CASELOAD AND- THERE ARE REQUIRED TO RECERTIFY EVERY SIX MONTHS THEREAFTER SO THAT THAT DECLINE HAS CONTINUED. THE TMB RESEARCH AND JUST TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND- HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT BENEFIT MAINTENANCE IS A TWO PAGE RECERTIFICATION FORM AND SO TO MAINTAIN ELIGIBILITY HOUSEHOLDS ARE REQUIRED SHOULD CONFIRM WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY CHANGES IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. IF CHANGES ARE REPORTED SO FOR EXAMPLE I THINK RECENT INCOME FOR A CHANGE OF THE ORIGINAL SSI RECIPIENTS WHO MAY NOT BE PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD THEY MUST APPLY FOR CALFRESH THAT IS. PART OF OUR TEAM BE POLICY. IF THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH THEY CAN STATE ON TMB- IF THEY CHANGED- HAS- RESULTED IN THE ORIGINAL SSI RECIPIENTS LEADING THEY WILL- FINANCIALLY SEE KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH CHANGE THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH. AND THEN- LASTLY THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE UNKNOWN AT THIS NUMBER WERE CONDUCTING MORE ANALYSIS ON THIS WHO MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETED THE RECERTIFICATION- AT ALL AND- THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO RETURN TO THE PROGRAM ONCE OR BENEFITS FOR DISCONTINUED OR THEY WILL HAVE A LOS TMB ELIGIBILITY I PERMANENTLY. AND NOT WITH THE RECERTIFICATION IS TWO PAGES RECEPTORS YOU SAID THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE FALLING OFF WHEN THEY HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED. YES WE MADE IT AS- SIMPLE AS WE COULD- WITH IN KIND OF THE PARAMETERS THAT WERE SET FOR US IN IN CODE AT THE TIME WE IMPLEMENTED AND SO IT IS IT TOO PAGE FORM WITH ABOUT FOUR QUESTIONS. AND THERE'S AND WE CAN MAIL THAT AND THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT BY PHONE AT THIS POINT. SO WE DO ALLOW. IT TO BE SIGNED ELECTRONICALLY SO IF A CLIENT WERE TO CALL IN. THE COUNTY WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SORT OF FILL IT OUT AND SIGN IT ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT OVER THE PHONE. BUT IT IS INITIALLY- MAIL TO THE CLIENT AS WELL AS A REMINDER. WE DIDN'T CLANKING MAIL BACK IN WITH HER A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVING TO GO TO THE COUNTY OFFICE. I'M FEELING VERY UNSAFE DURING THIS TIME. RIGHT NOW YES ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WE ARE PRIMARILY IN THIS IS FOR CAL FRACTION- TMB SMB WE ARE OPERATING OVER OF THE PHONE. AND ONLINE AND SO WHILE THERE ISN'T AN ONLINE VERSION OF THE TEAM BEFORE IT CAN BE COMPLETED OVER THE PHONE. THANK YOU OKAY. OKAY. THANK YOU SHOULD MOVE ON. OKAY SO I HAVE THE NEXT ISSUE AS WELL- THIS IS RELATED TO OUR- CALFRESH OPERATIONS SUPPORT B. C. P. I SAW THIS REQUEST INCLUDES THREE NEW POSITIONS AND POSITION OF AUTHORITY FOR NINETEEN EXISTING POSITIONS. LET ME START WITH THE NEW POSITIONS FIRST A NEW INFORMATION- SERVICES POSITION TO OVERSEE AND MAINTAIN OUR TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT USED TO BE LIKE BEFORE I CAN STOP YOU FROM IT I NEED TO GO BACK. TO THE ISSUE FOR THE L. A. L. PROJECT. HI JACQUELINE BRAZIL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH- WE OUR OFFICE IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS TO THE S. N. B. T. N. B. BENEFIT AMOUNTS AND ALSO LOOKING AT CURRENT CASELOAD TRENDS TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING- EXIT RATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE SECOND QUESTION- INVOLVING THAT THE FEASIBILITY OF. S. ISSUING REPLACEMENT BENEFITS FOR US IN BEING TEAM BE CASE SAYS- AS THE DEPARTMENT NOTED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS TO TAKE IN CONSIDERATION I'M SUCH AS THE NEEDED AUTOMATION CHANGES TO JUST FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE- THAT- IN LOOKING AT. IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM. IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON- IF THAT AUTOMATION CHANGE WERE PRIORITIZED WHICH HOW WOULD IT IMPACT THE TIMELINESS OF EXISTING SYSTEM CHANGES THAT ARE IN FLIGHT BUT THEN ALSO HOW WOULD IT IMPACT- IS SYSTEM CHANGES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN Q. AND TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF- HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO IMPLEMENT. AUTOMATION CHANGE TO THEN BEGIN ISSUING THOSE REPLACEMENT BENEFITS TO S. N. B. N. TEAM BE CASES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER ANDERSON. OKAY SO- I WILL START WITH THE NEW POSITIONS SO INFORMATION SERVICES OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY POSITION TO OVERSEE AND MAINTAIN TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE NEW TOOL ACCOUNT FRESH CONFIRM SO THEY CALPERS CONFIRM TOOL WAS BUILT TO VERIFY CALIBRATION BRAWL MEANT ORIGINALLY FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING CALFRESH EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES- SO THIS IS A REQUIREMENT OF OUR EMPLOYMENT- AND WORKFORCE SERVICES PROGRAM THAT YOU CONFIRM YOUR SERVING SOMEONE WHO'S RECEIVING CALFRESH. I'M AND IT'S REQUIRED TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT BY OUR NETWORK OF PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE SO THIS INCLUDES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- SUCH AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- GOODWILL'S AND SO ON SO ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS NEED TO CONFIRM THAT ENROLLMENT. THE LONG TERM VISION AT THAT IS THAT THE TOOL CAN ALSO BE USED TO VERIFY CAL FRESHEN ROLE MEANT TO CONNECT CALIFORNIANS TO OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH AS REDUCED COURT FINES- REDUCE COST PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES TRANSIT PASSES I MEAN THE LIST CAN GO ON AND ON AS CALFRESH SHOULD BE THE INDICATOR OF ELIGIBILITY. FOR THOSE OTHER SERVICES. SO WELL THIS FOR INSURERS OUR EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAM CONTINUES TO MEET THAT DEMAND FOR WORK FOR SERVICES ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC RELATED DOWNTURN. AND THAT THE WORLD MEDIATING COUNTY AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT MAY PREVENT OUR PARTNERS FROM PARTICIPATING. OF COURSE INCREASING ACCESS TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC- WOULD BE A GOAL AS WELL. A SECOND NEW POSITION IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SEXTANT SECTION CHIEF SO THEY ARE REQUESTED TO LEAD OUR EXISTING CALFRESH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM WHICH HAS GROWN OVER TIME AND IS NOW MADE UP OF SIX- MANAGERS THAT PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED TA TO THEIR ASSIGNED COUNTIES- THEY WORK WITH- TEAM MANAGERS TO IDENTIFY BOTH COUNTY SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS. BUT ALSO STATEWIDE NEEDS- AND THE SECTION CHIEF IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP PROVIDE A PROMOTE MORE STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY AND THAT UNIFIED HIM STATEWIDE VISION FOR INCREASING ACCESS OPERATIONS AND POLICY. AND THIS TEAM IS REALLY THAT- BRIDGE BETWEEN POLICY AND OUR OPERATIONS WORK AND SO THEY ARE ON HOW IN THE FIELD MAKING SURE THAT OUR POLICY IS IMPLEMENTED- WITH FOCUS ON ACCESS AND VICE VERSA THAT WE ARE INFORMED OF THE RIGHT POLICIES. TO SUPPORT THAT ACCESS. AND THE THIRD OF THE FINAL NEW POSITION IS ACCOUNT FOOD JUST. SECTION CHIEFS OF THIS IS OVER OUR EMERGENCY FOOD PROGRAMS TO LEAD OUR EXISTING TEAMS BUT ALSO THE NEWEST EDITION WHICH IS A UNIT DEDICATED TO OUR STATE EMERGENCY FOOD PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. OF PROVIDING THE LEADERSHIP NECESSARY TO BALANCE THAT EXISTING WORKLOAD BUT TO INCREASE COLLABORATION WITH OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVISORY GROUP MEMBERS. IN ADDITION- BETTER EQUIPPING US TO MANAGE FUTURE STATE INVESTMENTS IN THE EMERGENCY PHONE SYSTEM THAT'S A QUITE A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR US AS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING A NEW SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL IN THIS AREA- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE CAPACITY TO MEET. BOTH ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS- EXPECTATIONS AND THE STATE FUNDING EXPECTATIONS. AND LASTLY THE REQUEST EXPOSITION AUTHORITY FOR NINETEEN EXISTING POSITIONS WITHIN THE BRANCH SO WE HIRE THESE POSITIONS TO MEET IMMEDIATE NEED AND WE'RE NOW GOING THROUGH THIS FORMAL BUDGET PROCESS TO SEEK AUTHORITY FOR THE POSITIONS. OF MEDIA NEED INCLUDED SPECIAL PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON INCREASING ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION SOME OF WHICH I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN TO TODAY BUT ALSO- MEETING FEDERAL COMPLIANCE STANDARDS RELATED TO. QUALITY CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTED AS IT IN AS OUR CASELOAD HAS INCREASED SO HAS THE PROGRAM. IS GROWING WE ARE EXPECTED TO MEET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASKING UNDER ITS FOR OVERSIGHT AND ALBION CALFRESH THEY'RE ALSO POSITION SUPPORTING OUR CALFRESH HEALTHY LIVING. A PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR NUTRITION EDUCATION- PROGRAM HERE AT CDSS. ADEQUATE STAFFING ALLOWS A BRANCH TO CONTINUE MEETING PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ENSURES THAT AFFECTED ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ACCESS AND BENEFIT RETENTION STREAMLINED OPERATIONS AND- SERVING CALIFORNIA'S HARDEST. TO SERVE OUR POPULATIONS EQUITABLY. HOW WILL WE KNOW IF YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL. WELL I WOULD THERE ARE A COUPLE INDICATORS THAT WE TRACK CLOSELY OF COURSE OUR PARTICIPATION RATE BEING- CRITICAL- WE LOOK AT- BENEFIT RETENTION SO AS IT RELATES TO OUR CHURN RATES AND THEN UP IN THE WEEDS WE ALSO LOOK AT OUR ACCURACY AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO BOTH US AS ADMINISTRATORS BUT TO CLIENTS MAKING SURE THAT WERE INSURING BENEFITS. ACCURATELY AND THAT WE ARE A MEETING- PROGRAM EXPECTATIONS AROUND ACCESS- ON THE GROUND- AND AVOIDING THINGS LIKE- OVER PAYMENTS AND WHATNOT WHICH WE DON'T WANT TO SEE FOR ANY OF OUR CLIENTS SO A FUTURE DATE INDICATORS THAT WE TRACK QUITE CLOSELY. WE LIKE TO SEE THOSE ALL IMPROVE MMHM. THANK YOU CAN. CAN I JUST WAS SO WHY I MEAN IF IT. WHAT DO WE THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES OF SOME PEOPLE FINING UP ON CALFRESH AND I GUESS HOW CLOSE DO WE WORK WITH THE FOOD BANKS TO BE ABLE TO CATCH THE POPULATION WHO WHO WERE THERE AND PERHAPS NOT A CALFRESH. YEAH SO LET ME SPEAK UP. TO THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION FIRST AND THEN I'LL GET TO IT NUMBER PARTICIPATION RATE BUT- THAT THE- BANKS ARE PART OF OUR- FORMAL OUTREACH NETWORK SO WE DO HAVE. A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS TO ENSURE THAT FOOD BANKS AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. ARE ON THE GROUND PROVIDING APPLICATION ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THE WORD OUT SO THEY ARE- DEEPLY ENGAGE AND CAL FRESH OUTRAGE WORK AND- OFTEN SOME OF OUR STRONGEST ADVOCATES FOR INCREASED PARTICIPATION. THEY SEE THAT CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE- RESOURCE FOR FAMILIES AND THEN THE EMERGENCY FOOD NETWORK SO THEY ARE DEEPLY ENGAGED. IN INCREASING PARTICIPATION. OF THE QUESTION AROUND WHY ARE PARTICIPATION RATE IS- NOT HIGHER THE SORT OF. BEEN LONG STANDING KIND OF CONTENT AND DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS FROM. THAT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION TO- V. IMMIGRANT POPULATION TO KIND OF- LONG AGO WE SORT OF CAUGHT UP A POLICY DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE AROUND A FEDERAL OPTIONS SUCH AS REPORTING RIGHT AND SO THAT THEY GAP AROUND POLICY DECISIONS WE'VE WE'VE CLOSED AS BEST AS POSSIBLE AND SO WE DO THINK THERE REMAINS SORT OF A- GETTING THE WORD OUT- REDUCING STIGMA AND MAKING SURE THAT POPULATIONS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN UNSURE ABOUT HOW FRESH ARE UP TO SPEED ON. ITS AVAILABILITY AND IMPACTS ON THEIR OWN A STATUS IF THAT'S APPLICABLES. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY GOT ILLEGAL ANYTHING. THE THING. OKAY. MOVING ON. NEXT WE HAVE CORRENTI CANNON SPEAKING TO THE HOUSING ISSUES. GOOD AFTERNOON. HI GOOD AFTERNOON HI FOLKS MY NAME IS CARLENE YOU CANON AND I SERVE AS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF HOUSING HOMELESSNESS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SO TO BEGIN TODAY I WANTED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD ROVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD THE COUNTY'S ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION OF ADULT AND SENIOR CARE. FACILITIES INCLUDING AT WORK HOLD ARCS ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AS WELL AS GARCIA BEATS WHICH ARE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES. ELDERLY AND LASTLY FOR RC ACT. I RC F. B. I.'S WHICH ARE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE CHRONIC. SO THIS PROPOSAL BE EMPLOYED IN A LINE WITH THE PROPOSAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL- THAT PROPOSAL WOULD EXPAND TREATMENT IN RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. WITH YOU BROUGHT HEALTH. SO IN THE ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITY SIDE WHICH IS THE TERM THAT WE USE TO DESCRIBE OUR- I THANK. I'M PROVIDE A STRUCTURED HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE REQUIRE INSTITUTIONAL. SO ARTS RCS FEES ARE PART OF A CONTINUUM OF LONG TERM CARE SUPPORT PROVIDING NON MEDICAL CARE AND SUPERVISION TO ADULTS WHO MAY HAVE MENTAL PHYSICAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THOSE WHO ARE AGE SIXTY AND OVER WHO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WORK. BUT MANY OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE SETTINGS ARE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE TO BELIEVE IN ME MAY RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME AND STATE. I I'M SO IMPORTANT KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HAS A SHORTAGE I ADULT LOSING YOUR CHARACTERS THAT ACCEPT SS I SS YOUR RECIPIENT AND HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF SS I SS THE RECIPIENTS THAT RESIDE IN ADULT. FROM WORK OR TWENTY NIGHT. BUT THE THIRD. OF TWENTY TWENTY THE LAST WORK WHICH WE HAVE THE ACT THERE'S BEEN A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY SIX PERCENT. IN THE NUMBER OF SS I SS THE RECIPIENTS RESIDING IN ADULTS. THE FOR PROFIT. THEREFORE THE GOAL OF THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM IS TO CREATE A NEW ADULT AND SENIOR KERR- OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN PARTICULAR I'M WITH THE FOCUS ON SENIORS AND THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS STABILIZER EXISTING SETTINGS BUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS OR UNNECESSARY INSTITUTIONALIZATION PATTERSON DON'T. YES FUNDS WOULD BE PRIORITIZED THE CREATION OF NEW AND EXPANDED SETTINGS BUT COULD ALSO BE USED TO FUND CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND REHABILITATION COSTS FOR EXISTING SETTINGS THAT ARE AT RISK OF. WHEN APPLYING FOR THESE BONDS THE COUNTIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ENSURE THE STABILITY OF ANYONE WHO'S BASED. IN LEEDS ADULT YOUR- BODY. THIS PROPOSAL WEBER LOCAL INVESTMENT AND HE'S- INCLUDES OUT HOW THE FUNDING OR OTHER FUNDING THAT GO THAT ROUTE THE LADY FOR AUXILIARY FOR. OR IN MANY COULD BE THROUGH THE OF SERVICES ADDITION SERVICES ON I THINK OF WORK ON THEIR OP. I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SO. THAT THEY A ROAD MAP FOR THE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES CONTINUE ON WHICH INCLUDES ADULT AND SENIOR TECHNOLOGY. WHAT DO YOU THAT WOULD RISK AN- FUNDING MADE PURCHASED AND OWNED BY COUNTY. OR COULD BE OPERATOR. AN EXISTING FACILITIES THAT RECEIVE THIS WE HAVE FUNDING COULD CONTINUE TO BE OWNED BY AN EXISTING OWNER OPERATOR. IMPORTANT THESE FACILITIES WOULD MAINTAIN COVENANTS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS USE RESTRICTIONS TO CERTIFY THEIR INTENDEDUSE AND A RESIDENT POPULATION. YES IS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING AND MONITORING IN YOUR CARE FACILITIES. AS WELL AS PROGRAMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THE SAME. SERVICES IN THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. YES I ALSO BE ADMINISTRATOR I WOULD BE AT HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCATES FOR THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. I FOR SSI SS AND THE SAFETY PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVED VITAL. I'M THAT NUMBER OKAY BUT- THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THESE FUNDS WILL DEPEND ON THE PROPORTION OF FUNDING THAT WILL BE USED FOR EXPANSION VERSUS PRESERVATION. AND THIS PROPORTION WILL BE BASED ON THE LOCAL GAS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT- WILL BE A PART OF. IT OKAY OF FACILITIES- ACQUISITION AND WE HAVE WOULD BE MORE COSTLY THAN FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A LONG I'M SOME COMMUNITIES DON'T MAKE FOCUS ON EXPANSION IF THERE ARE YOU OR NOFACILITIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. I OTHER COMMUNITIES MAY FOCUS ON PRESERVING THE FACILITIES THAT ALREADY EXIST. THREE WE HAVE FUNDING. AND THEREFORE PRESERVING FACILITIES AND- BY DOING SO IT ALSO INCENTIVIZING ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE TARGET POPULATION THROUGH THESE BEHALF ON. THE SENSE OF THE LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA I'LL SHARE SOME DATA ON THESE FACILITY. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. NUMBER THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SEVEN ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES LICENSED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WE OF COURSE OF BAGS THAT STIR INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SS I SS HE- SAID THIS DOES EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SPENDING. IS BETTER- RENDERED EAT REGIONAL CENTERS FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT IT. I'M BEING USED I TWO THOUSAND AND FORTY SEVEN FACILITIES THEY HAVE A CAPACITY OF OVER 600-006-1000. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO BAD. BUT I'M OF THE FACILITIES I JUST JUST. NOT ALL ARE RECEIVING SSI B. AT ANY GIVEN TIME OKAY AWAY FROM OUR MOST RECENT DATA AGAIN FROM THAT THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE UP TO AN ESTIMATED FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THREE SS I RECIPIENTS LIVING ADULT AND- CALIFORNIA. I'M TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES THERE ARE 52% OF THOSE. FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ROUGHLY WHO ARE LIVING IN ADULT CARE SETTINGS AND 48% WHO ARE RESIDING. IN YOUR CARE ACT. THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGURE IN FOR THIS. WHICH I SHARED EARLIER IS THAT FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE AND APPROXIMATELY 6% THE NUMBER. YOU WERE LIVING IN THE- BACK. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THIS DECLINE AND EXPANDING AND PRESERVING THE LADIES A THIRD FFI AFTER THE RECIPIENT. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE HE- REALLY SEEMS. IF I CAN ASK YEAH HAVE WE- THANK HAVE WE HOW MANY BEDS ARE STILL AVAILABLE. SIXTY ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ONE HUNDRED. THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE. AND WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF EXERCISE PEOPLE IN THOSE BEDS. HAVE WE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE AMOUNT OF BEDS OR JUST THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN ESSENCE I S. S. P. IN THOSE BETS. QUESTION SO WE DON'T HAVE OCCUPANCY DATA FOR THESE FACILITIES. BUT WE CAN TRACK THE NUMBER SS I RECIPIENTS MOST FACILITIES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CENSUS IS GOING DOWN AND- IT JUST MEANS THAT THE NUMBER SS IRIS. CORRECT SO I THE WOULD NOT LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT AND ONE OF THE COMPLAINT I'VE HEARD. SINCE I WAS AT A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER WAS THE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SS SINUSES P. FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE. SO IT DOES INCREASING MORE BEDS ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF. BUT PEOPLENOT BEING ABLE TO STAY IN FACILITIES BECAUSE THE FACILITIES CAN'T MAKE IT ON THE RATE OF INCREASE IN PERSON. YEAH SO THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INCENTIVIZE. THESE OPERATORS TO ACCEPT SSI PARTICIPANTS AS A SITE RECIPIENTS- INTO THEIR SETTINGS I'M DOING SO BOTH THROUGH ACQUISITION AND WE HAD FUNDING BUT ALSO THROUGH LEVERAGING. INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT I GOT THROUGH COUNTY GOVERNMENT- ANISH CARE CLANS AND OTHERS WHO CAN PROVIDE OF THOSE AUXILIARY SERVICES IN SETTINGS- WHICH AND IN SOME CASES IT'S VERY DIRECT FUNDING TO THE FACILITIES. AND IN SOME CASES IT'S A PROVISION OF. IN KIND SERVICES OR CALL LOCATING- OTHER STAFF ON SITE TO. WORK THE UNIQUE. NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. AND WE THINK HUNDRED MILLION IS GOING TO DO IT FOR THIS OF CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY WITH THAT KNOW. HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER. SO AGAIN IT WILL BE IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT THE EXACT NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT WE CAN START WITH FEES FINES AND BECAUSE OF COURSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CREATING NEW FACILITIES WHICH IS IN MANY WAYS WILL WORK. ON AND TRY TO DO HERE IS CREATE NET NEW RESOURCES- BECAUSE THEY'RE SO VALUABLE UT AGAIN ALSO HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW US TO PRESERVE SPENDING. ON THAT COULD IT OPERATORS THAT COULD EXIT THE MARKET. BECAUSE THEY HAVE. NOT FOR EXAMPLE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AND IF THAT ISN'T BACK THE RATE LIMITING FACTOR ABOUT WHAT'S HOLDING SOMEONE BACK WE CAN SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. AS WELL. I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE AND WE AT WE ALL JUST RECEIVED BIG INTO OF CARE PACKAGE AND THIS IS INCLUDED IN THERE BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT YET. BUT PLENTY OF QUESTIONS FOR WE GO TO THE L. A. L. UGH ILIO DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THE SHORT WILL START IF YOU HAND UP THERE YES GOOD AFTERNOON ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BEFORE DIVING INTO MY COMMENTS- SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROPOSAL FOR ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES I JUST WANTED TO TAKE. A STEP BACK TO BROADLY NOTE THAT THIS IS ONE OF A FEW NEW KEY HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- ALL OF WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON THE ACQUISITION OR REHABILITATION OF PROPERTIES OF SOME SORT USING ONE TIME RESOURCES. AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZE CERTAINLY HOMELESSNESS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FACING THE STATE WE HAVE SOME- QUESTIONS IN GENERAL ABOUT HOW THESE- PROPOSED PROGRAMS WOULD TARGET HOMELESSNESS ULTIMATELY WHAT IMPACT THEY COULD HAVE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE ONE TIME IN NATURE OF THE FUNDS AND ALSO HOW THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WOULD COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER GIVEN SOME OF THEIR OVERLAPPING GOALS. ABOUT MOVING ON SPECIFIC TO THE PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO DATA LIMITATIONS- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS ABLE TO TRACK THE TOTAL NUMBER CAPACITY AND LOCATIONS OF ARSON RCMP IS THAT CLOSE. AS WELL AS NEW FACILITIES THAT OPEN. HOWEVER TO THE BEST OF OUR UNDERSTANDING THERE IS NOT AG AGGREGATED DATA AVAILABLE ABOUT FIRST WHY FACILITIES ARE CLOSING. FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO FINANCIAL CHALLENGES- SECOND IF THERE ARE CERTAIN TRAITS THAT ARE COMMON TO THE FACILITIES THAT ARE CLOSING FOR EXAMPLE HAVING- MORE AS AS AS AS P. RESIDENTS OR OR BELOW AVERAGE MARKET. RATES AND THIRD WHAT HAPPENS TO RESIDENTS ONE FACILITIES CLOSE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THEY BECOME HOMELESS OR ARE ABLE TO MOVE INTO A DIFFERENT FACILITY. AND WITHOUT KNOWING THESE DATA POINTS ASSESSING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT THESE FACILITIES IS A BIT CHALLENGING. IN PARTICULAR- GIVEN THESE DELIMITATIONS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS DRIVING ARE VAN RCMP CLOSURES AND ACCORDINGLY WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THE PROPOSED ONE TIME FUNDS- WILL BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ADDRESS CLOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE KNEW THAT FACILITIES FOR CLOSING DUE TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND IF ONE TIME- IF A ONE TIME FUNDING APPROACH WOULD BE- SUFFICIENT AT MITIGATING CLOSURES WHILE ALTERNATIVELY- AND DISCUSS TO THE POINT THAT THE TERMINATE REGARDING SS I SS P. RATES. IF WE HAD DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT CLOSURES ARE ACTUALLY DRIVEN BY- THESE INSUFFICIENT RATES THAT WE COULD ASSESS WHETHER A MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PREVENT CLOSURES MIGHT ACTUALLY BE- TO INCREASE THOSE RATES FOR ALL OF THE SS I SS P. NON MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE. I ALL OF ARE SAID. BUT AGAIN WITHOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE IT'S JUST CHALLENGING TO ASSESS- WHICH- INTERVENTION MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE. AND THEN BEYOND DATA LIMITATIONS- WE ALSO JUST WANTED TO RAISE A FEW CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- AROUND THE LACK OF IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR THIS PURPOSE PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY WE NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED- THERE WILL NOT BE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH THIS PROGRAM- BUT RATHER THE PROGRAM WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- WE DO NOTE THAT DETAILS ARE STILL EVOLVING AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FULLY UNDERSTAND- THE ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED RECENTLY- BUT AT THIS POINT. AND GIVEN THAT THERE WON'T BE TRAILER ILL LANGUAGE WE JUST HAVE A NUMBER OF MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSAL AND ALSO ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OVERSEE THE PROGRAM- FOR EXAMPLE AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US HOW THE FUNDS. WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED WE UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WOULD ADMINISTER GRANTS AND THERE WILL BE SOME SORT OF APPLICATION PROCESS. WE'RE JUST NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR ON HOW FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND DISBURSED- ALSO. AGAIN STILL WORKING UNDERSTAND ALL THE DETAILS BUT WE'RE NOT CLEAR HOW EXACTLY FACILITIES RECEIVING FUNDS COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR EXAMPLE WOULD THEY BE REQUIRED TO SERVE- A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF ISIS ISIS P. RESIDENTS BUT THEY BE REQUIRED TO REMAIN OPEN FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING FUNDS. AT THIS POINT WHERE JUST NOT CLEAR- SO JUST AND BY NOTING WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S FULL HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS. INCLUDING THIS PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT ARSON RCMP IS- WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON OUR. WEBSITE SO I'LL STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER ANY LIKE. OKAY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE- YOU'RE THINKING LIKE I WAS THINKING. ALL RIGHT FROM SO DR PAN- HAS LEFT. ANYTHING ON THE PART OF FINANCE. WELL YES BRENT HAUSER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN WOULD ONLY NO JUST IN RELATION TO PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THE FACT SHE WAS RECENTLY SHARED THAT I THINK WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSSIONS ON THIS TOPIC AS WELL AS- ADMINISTRATION DOES PLAN ON INCLUDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO OUTLINE SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM AND ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THE LEGISLATION THE COMING MONTHS ON THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. STILL BE INTERESTED THE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS AS AS WE GO FORWARD. OKAY. SOME MOVING ON THEN. OKAY GREAT CAREER THIS IS CORINNE YOU CAN AGAIN HELLO- I RAN AGAIN. YES HI YOU CAN AGAIN I'M HAVING. SHARE OUR NEXT THE NEXT ITEM- SO YOU WANT TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW THIS ONE IS RELATED TO STAFFING REQUEST. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO FIND THREE POINT FIVE DSS YEAH REFER TO EXISTING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT SERVED. CAL WORKS FAMILIES. THE FIRST IS THE- ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE'RE REQUESTING ONE POINT FIVE STAFF WHICH INCLUDES ONE- ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM ANALYSTS AND ONE HALF TIME STAFF SERVICES MANAGER ONE BUT TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ONGOING COUNTY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

IT. DID NOT INCLUDE I. I'D LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY SHARE ON THE APPROACH THAT WE TAKE IN OUR WORK TO AND- TO OUR TEAM INTO. WITH LOCAL OPERATORS TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND REACH THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I'M IN THAT FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY CSS I SUPPORTED COUNTIES AND TRIBES PROVIDING CRITICAL HOUSING INTERVENTIONS OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OR HOUSING INSTABILITY ACROSS OUR STICKS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TEAM WORKS WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED LOCAL PROGRAMS. TO PROVIDE INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OVERSIGHT TO DELIVER THESE WORK. THE WORK REQUIRE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS STAFFED. BY PROGRAM AND REQUIRES PROGRAM WE UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC LANDSCAPE. AND THE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SHOP ADDITIONAL THREE POINT FIVE POSITION. POSITIONS WERE AND PROPOSED WERE GROUP'S OF PRO OUT. COOPER INNOVATION AND DATA DRIVEN. ALSO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE- HOME REQUEST FOR ONE THREE BY STAFF. ABSOLUTELY THE COLOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS TO HELP FAMILY IN MACAU PROGRAM YOU COST SHARING HER PERMANENT. OR TO PROVIDE AND SHELTER WHEN AT THE END. WHAT VEHICLE YOU'RE NINETY TWENTY. 650-005-0070 FOUR. WORKS FOR IN THE- PROGRAM. ONE POINT FIVE POSITION IN THE OF SYSTEMS WORK WOULD ALLOW FOR THE- OF TENDS TO FIVE WHICH MADE TO BE COULD CHANGE TO THE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM INCLUDING RECALL THAT TEMPORARY HOUSES. GRANTORS AND ON THE DAY THAT THE ON APPLY FOR HOMELESS AND WE'RE THE ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR. HAVE THAN A HIGH DOLLARS ACTUALLY YEAH THESE CHANGES I WILL NOTE OUR EXPECT IN THE OF. THE STAFF WORK ESPECIALLY WITH THE SB TENDS FIVE CHANGES PARTICULARLY AFTER AND YOU GUIDANCE REGARDING THE POLICY CHANGES IMPLEMENTED LEGISLATIVE UPDATE YEAH COUNTY OUT REVISING THE SPEED AND NOTICED THAT WAS BROWN A STATE RIGHT. AND WORK WITH THE SYSTEMS FOR THE TIMELY ACT AUTOMATION THE PARTICULAR HE. ON THE SIDE THAT HOUSE SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON THE WORK FOR TO STAFF THEIR- ALL JUST A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF. AND THANK HOW WORKED SUPPORT PROGRAM WAS BY SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE INTO FOURTEEN IS AN IN TO FOSTER HOUSE STABILITY FOR EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR PROGRAM. IT IS A STATE FUNDED RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM BEST LOOK WITH MINISTER I COUNTY DEPARTMENT. BERMAN SAYS THE PROGRAM PROVIDES RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER SUPPORT NEEDED TO REFER YEAH I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR PROGRAM WE'RE EXPERIENCING HOMELESS HOMELESSNESS YOU ACCESS AND THEN RETAINS. ABLE HOUSING. THEY JUST BE PROGRAM A COME GRANT PROGRAM AND SPEECH ALLOCATE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY TO FIFTY FOUR COUNTIES ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS FOLLOWS A CONTINUED TREND OF PROGRAMS BROWN. GRAHAM STARTED INITIALLY WITH TWENTY PARTICIPATING COUNTIES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WE HAD ADDITIONAL COUNTIES WHO OPTED IN EVERY YEAR SINCE WE'VE WATCHED THE PROGRAM. THE STAFF RESOURCES WERE PROVIDED TO DSS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS FUNDED AT THIRTY FIVE MILLION. EIGHT OUT AND HAVE 35% SINCE THEN THE PROGRAM HAS INCREASED TO NINETY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY AND HAS NINETEEN YOU COUNTY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT THAT- BUT WITH NO NEW STAFFING TO GO ALONG WITH. CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN BOTH FUNDING AND COUNTY YEAH. THE NEW POSITIONS THAT WERE REQUESTING WOULD SUPPORT PROGRAM EXPANSION BUT HAPPENED IN THESE PREVIOUS YEARS AS WELL AS THE ON GOING POLICY AND PROGRAM GUIDE AND EAT. CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE STRONGEST PROGRAM POSSIBLE TO COMBAT FAMILY HOMELESSNESS. INTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY OUR TEAM AND WE BELIEVE IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL GIVEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACED BY FAMILIES AND PROPERTY INTO WORKS. FOR OUR PROGRAM. IT WAS A QUESTIONS. ABOUT HOW THE- AS A SUPPORT PROGRAM IN IRAQ WITH OTHER PROGRAMS IN DSS OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO TARGET ASSISTANCE TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SO I'M I WILL SAY THAT AGAIN THESE THESE TWO PROGRAMS HOMELESS THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND HST PROGRAM ARE BOTH ABOUT MEETING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF HOMEWORK HOUSEWORK YEAH. YES THAT'S AS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ESPECIALLY THE- I'M HOUSING. PROGRAM IS KIND. WITH LOCAL HOMELESS CONTINUUM HAIR AND COORDINATED ENTRY. WHICH ALLOWS OUR OPERATORS ACCESS HOUSING SERVICES IN THE BROADER HOLD. IT ALSO CREATES PATHWAYS FOR THOSE SAME AND HOUSING PROVIDERS TO BETTER LEVERAGE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO MEET. THE NEEDS OF OUR- WITCH'S COURT LONG TERM HOUSING ELEGY. IN OTHER WORDS THESE PROGRAMS SUPPORT EACH OTHER BY ENSURING ACCESS TO SERVICES ALONG WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER I CONTINUE ON MY HOUSING RESOURCES. MICHAEL WE WOULD UTILIZE. THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY SHELTER AVAILABLE RECALL THAT HA PROGRAM **** ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PRIOR TO HOUSING SOMEONE THREW IT BACK HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WHICH IS A LONGER TERM. AND THEN IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HOUSING SUPPORT PARTICIPANTS- WERE SEARCHED RAPID RE HOUSING MODEL SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY ACTUALLY NEED A LONGER TERM INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. AND THAT'S WHY THE CONNECTION TO THE HOMEWORK YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR IS SO IMPORTANT. I THANK ON CONNECT PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. YOU LONGER TERM DIRECTION- I'M JUST ADVISING THAT THESE THREE POINT FIVE POSITIONS- WILL HELP US TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT YES GRAMS PROVIDE. ACCESS TO PROVING APPROVING HOUSING INTERVENTIONS BURKE HOW IT WORKS YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU. HELLO. NO COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL OKAY- I GUESS MY BEST MY ONE COMMENT IS IN AND. SO SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES. WE'RE PREVENTED FROM HOMELESSNESS OR TAKEN OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. THOSE WERE FAMILIES WHO ARE SERVED THROUGH THROUGH THE PROGRAM THE- EITHER RECEIVED AT THE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE WHICH IS- AT THAT MEANS AMERICANS YOU SHELTER FOR SIXTEEN DAYS OR THEY RECEIVE PERMANENT HM WHICH MEANS I SUPPORT WITH THINGS LIKE I PAYING FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT I WENT WHEN MOVING INTO A PERMANENT HOUSING INTERVENTION. IN I WOULD LOOK AT IT THIS SIXTEEN WERE JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH A SHORT OF IT OF HOUSING WE HAVE A LOW INCOME PERSON YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A PLACE FOR THEM THAT'S THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE EASIEST. THING TO UNDERTAKE. SO IT REALLY IS AGAIN ABOUT. A CONNECTING PEOPLE TO THE ENTIRE HOMELESS CONTINUUM OF CARE AND GETTING PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THE LONG TERM. PERSON BUT THEY'LL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND- THAT HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR IS ONE OF THOSE. ONE OF THOSE MECHANISM FOR CONNECTING PEOPLE- YOU. FOR EXAMPLE RAPID RE HOUSING INTERVENTIONS WHICH WHICH ARE ABLE TO PAY RENT THEM PROVIDE RAPAROUND SPEAK MANAGEMENT- HELP PEOPLE QUICKLY EXIT HOMELESSNESS. AND. THEIR OWN UNIT. IT OPENS IN. ABOUT MARKET YOU KNOW. WELCOME THANK YOU HARD I'M A AND I KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THAT THAT SOUNDS LOVELY BUT WE JUST HAVE TO DRIVE DOWN THE STREET TO SEE IT'S NOT WORKING OUT VERY WELL FOR A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR FOLKS ARE TRYING TO TOUCH.
