00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:03.769 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL THAT

IN. MAYBE THEY'LL BE EXTENDED OR

MAYBE THEY WON'T. MAYBE SOME OF

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:18.650 region:rollup2
THEM WILL BE EXTENDED AND SOME

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.753 region:rollup2
OF THEM WON'T AS WE SAW WITH THE

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.521 region:rollup2
OF. THE BUSH TAX CUTS THAT WERE

00:25:20.753 --> 00:25:24.656 region:rollup2
A. PASSED I THINK IN TWO

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.925 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWO IN SUNSET IN TWO

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.893 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE I MEAN THAT.

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:29.928 region:rollup2
CONGRESSMAN PRESENT SORT OF.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:31.096 region:rollup2
.

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.398 region:rollup2
PICKS IT PICKED AND CHOSE WHICH

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:33.565 region:rollup2
ONES THEY WANTED TO KEEP AND

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:34.767 region:rollup2
WHICH ONES THEY DIDN'T MAYBE

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:36.402 region:rollup2
WE'LL SEE THE SAME THING AFTER

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:37.970 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE WOULD

00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:39.071 region:rollup2
HAVE TO STAY TUNED.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.205 region:rollup2
THE CORPORATE PROVISIONS IN

00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:42.574 region:rollup2
CONTRAST ALMOST ALL OF THEIR

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.742 region:rollup2
PERMANENT.

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:45.611 region:rollup2
AND WE'LL GET TO THE EXPENSING A

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:49.181 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LATER.

00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:51.216 region:rollup2
THE FLIP NOW TO PAGE THREE.

00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:52.718 region:rollup2
OKAY THE HANDOUTS SAYS KEY

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:55.487 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROVISIONS FOR NON

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:58.023 region:rollup2
ITEMIZE HERS. MOST OF THESE ALSO

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:59.658 region:rollup2
APPLIED ITEMIZE THERE'S.

00:25:58.023 --> 00:26:01.293 region:rollup2
NOW ONE THING THE BILL DID IS

00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:03.162 region:rollup2
ELIMINATED THE PERSONAL

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:03.529 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE IN THE

00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:05.230 region:rollup2
CURRENT IN THE.

00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:07.099 region:rollup2
.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:09.234 region:rollup2
THE OLD TAX CODE WAS ABOUT FOUR

00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:10.969 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS A PERSON THOSE

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.870 region:rollup2
ARE GOING THE WAY NOW. BUT ONE

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:13.605 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THEY DID TO

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.907 region:rollup2
COMPENSATE FOR THAT IS TO RAISE

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:16.909 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD DEDUCTION.

00:26:14.907 --> 00:26:18.377 region:rollup2
THEY THEY.

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:20.179 region:rollup2
THE HANDOUT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS

00:26:18.377 --> 00:26:21.747 region:rollup2
FOR JOINT RETURNS.

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:23.048 region:rollup2
BUT THE STANDARD DEDUCTION WAS

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:24.149 region:rollup2
ALSO NEARLY DOUBLED FOR.

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:25.684 region:rollup2
.

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:28.720 region:rollup2
SINGLE FILERS AND FOR HEAD OF

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:30.255 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLD FILERS.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.356 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THAT THE RATES

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.758 region:rollup2
ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER ACROSS

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:35.127 region:rollup2
THE BOARD.

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:36.895 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SHOW THE TABLE HERE BUT

00:26:35.127 --> 00:26:37.996 region:rollup2
IN GENERAL THEY'RE A BIT LOWER.

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:39.131 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THEY DID TO

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:40.432 region:rollup2
COMPENSATE PEOPLE FOR

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:42.234 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING THE PERSONAL

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:44.336 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS WAS.

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:46.171 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE THE CHILD CREDITS

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.739 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD LAW.

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:49.942 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CLAIM A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:51.410 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY A YOUNG DEPENDENT YOU

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.978 region:rollup2
HAVE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.147 region:rollup2
THAT DOUBLES THE TWO THOUSAND

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:56.849 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ANOTHER DIFFERENCE.

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:58.550 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHANGE THEY MADE.

00:26:56.849 --> 00:27:00.185 region:rollup2
WAS IT UNDER THE OLD LOT NONE OF

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.054 region:rollup2
IT WAS REFUNDABLE MEANING THAT

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:03.655 region:rollup2
YOU CAN NOT USE.

00:27:02.054 --> 00:27:05.824 region:rollup2
CHILD CREDIT TO REDUCE YOUR

00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:07.159 region:rollup2
LIABILITY BELOW ZERO.

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:08.961 region:rollup2
NOW IT IS REFUNDABLE TO A

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:11.130 region:rollup2
CERTAIN EXTENT SO EVEN IF YOUR

00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:12.030 region:rollup2
LIABILITY IS BELOW. THE AMOUNT

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.866 region:rollup2
OF YOUR CHILD CREDIT YOU CAN

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.234 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:27:13.866 --> 00:27:16.368 region:rollup2
YOU STILL CLAIM THE AMOUNT OF

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:18.570 region:rollup2
THE CHILD CREDIT IN THE.

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:20.005 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF HAVING POSITIVE Y.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.974 region:rollup2
BILL YOU HAVE NEGATIVE LIABILITY

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:23.408 region:rollup2
IS SOME TAXPAYERS CURRENTLY DO

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:24.409 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THEY TAKE THE

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:25.344 region:rollup2
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.045 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S HOW THE NEW CHILD

00:27:25.344 --> 00:27:30.182 region:rollup2
CREDIT WOULD WORK.

00:27:27.045 --> 00:27:31.750 region:rollup2
IF YOU'D FLIP NOW TO PAGE FOUR.

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:31.917 region:rollup2
THIS SHOWS A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.253 region:rollup2
HOW.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:35.921 region:rollup2
.

00:27:34.253 --> 00:27:36.555 region:rollup2
HOW IS SAMPLE HOUSEHOLD WOULD BE

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:38.223 region:rollup2
AFFECTED?

00:27:36.555 --> 00:27:39.892 region:rollup2
UNDER THE NEW LAW COMPARED TO

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:41.059 region:rollup2
THE OLD LAW.

00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:42.661 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THE HOUSEHOLD WITH

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.996 region:rollup2
TWO ADULTS TWO KIDS UNDER

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.031 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:47.866 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN INCOME.

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:49.468 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD LAW THE WE GET FOR

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:50.936 region:rollup2
PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS YA ONE FOR

00:27:49.468 --> 00:27:52.704 region:rollup2
EACH ADULT AND THEN ONE FOR EACH

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.438 region:rollup2
KID.

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:55.641 region:rollup2
SO THAT WOULD REDUCE THEIR

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:57.242 region:rollup2
INCOME BY SIXTEEN POINT TWO K..

00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:59.244 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THIS SIXTEEN THOUSAND

00:27:57.242 --> 00:28:00.679 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED.

00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:02.080 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ASSUMING THEY'RE NOT

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.549 region:rollup2
ITEMIZING THEY WOULD ALSO TAKE

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.384 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD DEDUCTION WHICH FOR

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.885 region:rollup2
A JOINT RETURN UNDER THE OLD LAW

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:07.986 region:rollup2
WAS TWELVE THOUSAND SEVEN

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:09.821 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:11.256 region:rollup2
TO PUT THOSE TOGETHER TAXABLE

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:13.859 region:rollup2
INCOME GOES FROM SEVENTY FIVE

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:15.160 region:rollup2
DOWN TO FORTY SIX ONE.

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:17.229 region:rollup2
NOTING THE NEW LAW THE PERSONAL

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.763 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS ARE GONE BUT THE

00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:19.064 region:rollup2
STANDARD DEDUCTIONS A LOT

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:21.400 region:rollup2
BIGGER.

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:22.534 region:rollup2
SO TAXABLE INCOME FALLS TO FIFTY

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.436 region:rollup2
ONE THOUSAND OKAY

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:26.205 region:rollup2
SO TAXABLE INCOME HAS GONE UP

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:28.073 region:rollup2
UNDER THE NEW LAW BUT. REMEMBER

00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.640 region:rollup2
THE RATES ARE ALSO GENERALLY A

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:30.242 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LOWER ACROSS THE

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.610 region:rollup2
BOARD.

00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:33.579 region:rollup2
SO EVEN WITH THE HIGHER TAXABLE

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.280 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:36.448 region:rollup2
THEY END UP WITH A LOWER BASED

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.849 region:rollup2
TAX BEFORE THEY CLAIM THEIR

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:40.319 region:rollup2
CREDITS AND IT DROPS A LITTLE

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:42.621 region:rollup2
OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:43.889 region:rollup2
NOW REMEMBER THOUGH.

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:45.691 region:rollup2
THE CHILD CREDITS HAVE DOUBLED

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:47.659 region:rollup2
FROM A THOUSAND DOLLARS A KID TO

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:49.094 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A KID.

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.495 region:rollup2
SO STEM CLAIMING TWO THOUSAND

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:52.064 region:rollup2
CHILD CREDITS THEY CAN NOW CLAIM

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:54.399 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND.

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:56.168 region:rollup2
SO OVERALL THEIR TAX THEIR

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:57.836 region:rollup2
FEDERAL INCOME TAX BILL. DROPS

00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:58.236 region:rollup2
FROM A LITTLE UNDER FOUR

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:59.671 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TO ABOUT.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:01.073 region:rollup2
.

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:02.174 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED IN SHADE YOUR

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:07.279 region:rollup2
A CHANGE A LITTLE OVER TWO

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:09.281 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:10.549 region:rollup2
NOW ARM.

00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:11.483 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLDS A

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:12.484 region:rollup2
CHANGE OF THE DIFFERENT

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:13.051 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THEIR INCOME HOW

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:14.886 region:rollup2
MANY.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:16.221 region:rollup2
DID DEPENDENCE THEY HAVE AND

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:17.556 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY ITEMIZE OR DON'T

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:20.792 region:rollup2
ITEMIZE.

00:29:17.556 --> 00:29:22.261 region:rollup2
SO HE FLIPPED A PAGE FIVE.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:24.696 region:rollup2
IT'LL SHOW SOME PROVISIONS THAT

00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:25.864 region:rollup2
APPLY ONLY TO ITEMIZE IS BUT NOT

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:28.066 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T ITEMIZE.

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:29.534 region:rollup2
.

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:31.770 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW THE CHAIR MENTIONED

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:33.538 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS STATE AND LOCAL TAX

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.041 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION HAS BEEN PARED BACK.

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:38.176 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD LAW.

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:39.911 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DEDUCT YOUR PROPERTY TAX

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:42.114 region:rollup2
IT EITHER YOUR INCOME TAX YOUR

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:43.715 region:rollup2
SALES TAX WHICHEVER ONES HIGHER

00:29:42.114 --> 00:29:45.784 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST EVERYONE

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:47.219 region:rollup2
WHO TOOK THIS DEDUCTION DEDUCTED

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:48.086 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME TAXES OPPOSED THEIR

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:50.355 region:rollup2
SALES TAX.

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:52.457 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:55.027 region:rollup2
THAT HAS THAT SET UP HIS NOT

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:56.428 region:rollup2
CHANGE WHICH CHANGED IS THAT.

00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:58.463 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD LAW YOU CAN DEDUCT

00:29:56.428 --> 00:30:00.599 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.633 region:rollup2
THE TAXES YOU OWED UNDER THE NEW

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:02.801 region:rollup2
LAW YOU CANNOT DEDUCT MORE THAN

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:04.970 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.438 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.174 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BUY IT A FAIR

00:30:06.438 --> 00:30:11.410 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:12.477 region:rollup2
OKAY ALSO IN MADE SOME CHANGES

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.013 region:rollup2
TO THE MORTGAGE INTEREST

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:16.448 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION UNDER THE OLD LAW. IT

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:18.083 region:rollup2
WAS LIMITED TO MORTGAGE DEBT

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:19.451 region:rollup2
UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS SO WHAT

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:21.853 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS IS IF YOU'RE MORTGAGE

00:30:19.451 --> 00:30:23.822 region:rollup2
WAS OVER A MILLION. IT'S REDUCE

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:25.090 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONATELY BY YOU KNOW THE

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.491 region:rollup2
MOUTH WAS OVER FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.993 region:rollup2
YOU HAD A TWO MILLION DOLLAR

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.928 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE YOU CAN DEDUCT HALF OF

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:31.930 region:rollup2
YOUR MORTGAGE INTEREST.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:34.332 region:rollup2
KATE THAT BASIC SET UP IS THE

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:36.234 region:rollup2
SAME EXCEPT THAT THE LIMIT NOW

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:37.803 region:rollup2
DROPS FROM A MILLION TO SEVEN

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.770 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND.

00:30:37.803 --> 00:30:41.006 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU'RE MORTGAGE IS A

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.540 region:rollup2
MILLION AND A HALF THEN YOU CAN

00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:43.508 region:rollup2
TO DOT HACK YOUR MORTGAGE

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.277 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:46.745 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IS

00:30:45.277 --> 00:30:48.447 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN NOT WE CAN NO

00:30:46.745 --> 00:30:49.448 region:rollup2
LONGER.

00:30:48.447 --> 00:30:51.183 region:rollup2
IN DOT THE MORTGAGE INTEREST ON

00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:53.885 region:rollup2
A HOME EQUITY LOAN.

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:55.620 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:56.788 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU FLIP NOW TO PAGE SIX

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.191 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME OTHER.

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.591 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT.

00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:01.960 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.128 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX PAYERS

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:06.898 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM DON'T APPLY TO

00:31:03.128 --> 00:31:08.433 region:rollup2
EVERYONE BUT SOME OF THEM DO.

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:10.035 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE OF THRESHOLD THAT

00:31:08.433 --> 00:31:11.870 region:rollup2
THEY USED TO CALCULATE WHETHER

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:13.638 region:rollup2
YOU NEED.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.674 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CHANGE A THRESHOLD

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:17.442 region:rollup2
OF INCOME.

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:19.411 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE THE DETERMINE WHETHER

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:20.345 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO USE THE ALTAR.

00:31:19.411 --> 00:31:21.580 region:rollup2
HOW THROUGH THE MINIMUM TAX OR

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.881 region:rollup2
NOT?

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.516 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOUR INCOME WAS BELOW

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.984 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU DIDN'T HAVE

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:27.386 region:rollup2
TO DO THE CALCULATION.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:29.154 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TOOK THAT

00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:30.789 region:rollup2
LEVEL? IN THEY RAISED IT SO

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.389 region:rollup2
FEWER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:33.658 region:rollup2
HIT BY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.859 region:rollup2
TAX.

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:36.695 region:rollup2
ALSO.

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:38.063 region:rollup2
.

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:40.532 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A NEW TWENTY PERCENT

00:31:38.063 --> 00:31:43.135 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION FOR SOME TYPES OF

00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:44.669 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INCOME THAT SOME.

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:45.804 region:rollup2
NOT CORPORATE INCOME BUT

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:47.038 region:rollup2
BUSINESS INCOME THAT'S PAID

00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:48.373 region:rollup2
UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:49.775 region:rollup2
WHICH IS TYPICALLY THINGS LIKE

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:51.943 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP FOR PROPRIETORS

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:53.645 region:rollup2
INCOME. THE WAY THEY SET IT UP

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:55.480 region:rollup2
IS THEY WANTED TO APPLY MOSTLY

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.982 region:rollup2
TO PARTNERSHIPS AS OPPOSED TO

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.384 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE SOLE

00:31:56.982 --> 00:32:01.253 region:rollup2
PROPRIETORS. BUT THE WAY THEY A

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:03.121 region:rollup2
CALCULATE THE OF. THAT NEW

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:04.689 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION THERE'S.

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:06.324 region:rollup2
A FAIR AMOUNT OF GRAY AREA AND

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:08.994 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR HOW

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:09.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA SHAKE OUT.

00:32:08.994 --> 00:32:12.030 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:32:09.528 --> 00:32:14.666 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THE BILL DOES IS

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.768 region:rollup2
REALLY REPEALS THE MANDATE THAT

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:17.669 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS BUY HEALTH INSURANCE

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.337 region:rollup2
NOW THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.405 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT IS NOT IN EFFECT YET

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.840 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T GOING TO

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:23.742 region:rollup2
PLACE UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.943 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:27.179 region:rollup2
SO WE PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANY.

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:29.414 region:rollup2
.

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.981 region:rollup2
EFFECTS FROM THAT THIS YEAR BUT

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:32.017 region:rollup2
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:33.618 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:32:32.017 --> 00:32:35.454 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THE ALSO THAT'S

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:37.889 region:rollup2
PERMANENT THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY

00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:39.858 region:rollup2
AFTER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:41.726 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THEY DID IS CHANGE

00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:42.928 region:rollup2
THE WAY THEY CALCULATE THE

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.629 region:rollup2
INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:45.163 region:rollup2
BRACKETS IN FOR A THE STANDARD

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:47.532 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION AND THAT SORT OF

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:49.367 region:rollup2
THING.

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:50.535 region:rollup2
WITH THE THEY ONE USES A

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:52.170 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT METHOD OF.

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:53.705 region:rollup2
DETERMINING THE CONSUMER PRICE

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:56.741 region:rollup2
INDEX IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:58.376 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN A CONSUMER BEHAVIOR.

00:32:56.741 --> 00:33:00.312 region:rollup2
THE UPSHOT OF THAT IS THAT. IN

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:02.047 region:rollup2
MOST YEARS YOU WOULD EXPECT A

00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:03.582 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY LOWER INFLATION

00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:05.183 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT THAN WE'D WE'VE HAD

00:33:03.582 --> 00:33:08.119 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:09.454 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD LAW.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.789 region:rollup2
INVENT THAT'S ALSO A PERMANENT

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:12.123 region:rollup2
CHANGE IT DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:14.759 region:rollup2
OLD LAW AFTER TWO THOUSAND

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:15.961 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE SO. THIS CHANGE

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:18.029 region:rollup2
ISN'T EXPECTED TO HAVE A BIG

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.930 region:rollup2
IMPACT RIGHT AWAY BUT OVER TIME

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:20.265 region:rollup2
MIDDLE ACCUMULATED HAVE A

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.900 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY LOWER INFLATION

00:33:20.265 --> 00:33:23.635 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT EVERY YEAR. AND SO BY

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.870 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S

00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:26.972 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.473 region:rollup2
PIECE.

00:33:26.972 --> 00:33:30.075 region:rollup2
FINALLY ONE THING THEY DID WAS

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:32.544 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE EXEMPTIONS FOR.

00:33:30.075 --> 00:33:33.144 region:rollup2
.

00:33:32.544 --> 00:33:34.312 region:rollup2
THE ESTATE TAX IN OTHER WORDS

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:36.081 region:rollup2
THEY WERE.

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:37.916 region:rollup2
THE INCREASED THE THRESHOLD OF

00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:40.619 region:rollup2
THE SIZE OF IN THE STATE THE

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:41.686 region:rollup2
TAXES DUE ON IN SO. THE RESULT

00:33:40.619 --> 00:33:43.288 region:rollup2
OF THAT IS THAT.

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:45.023 region:rollup2
FEWER PEOPLE TO HAVE TO PAY THE

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:47.025 region:rollup2
ESTATE TAX IN THE WERE A COLLECT

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:48.860 region:rollup2
LESS MONEY FROM.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:50.195 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE LAST SLIDE SHOWS

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.330 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BUSINESS PROVISIONS.

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:53.565 region:rollup2
.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:55.333 region:rollup2

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:03.575 region:rollup2
PUTTING IF A TEMPORARY PROVISION

LAW.

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:21.393 region:rollup2
OKAY THEY PAY FOR SOME OF THIS

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:23.094 region:rollup2
BY LIMITING THE DEDUCTION THAT.

00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:25.196 region:rollup2
.

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.730 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS CAN TAKE ON

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:26.865 region:rollup2
INTEREST THEY PAY. IN SOME

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.600 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:30.068 region:rollup2
.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.670 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIONS RELATING TO NET

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.938 region:rollup2
OPERATING LOSSES AND SOME OTHER

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.573 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT RECRUITS A LOT OF

00:34:32.938 --> 00:34:35.707 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE.

00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:37.175 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE FROM

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:38.343 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE RATE IN ALLOWING

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:40.111 region:rollup2
THIS EXPENSING BUT IT DOESN'T

00:34:38.343 --> 00:34:43.982 region:rollup2
RECOUP AT ALL.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:46.251 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THEY DO IS THEM.

00:34:43.982 --> 00:34:47.953 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH THE TREATMENT OF THE

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:49.554 region:rollup2
FOUR FILL THE OVERSEAS

00:34:47.953 --> 00:34:52.791 region:rollup2
AFFILIATES OF THE U. S.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:54.326 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS.

00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:57.195 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT WAS DONE UNDER THE

00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:58.563 region:rollup2
OLD LAW.

00:34:57.195 --> 00:35:00.098 region:rollup2
ALL THE INCOME OF THE

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:02.500 region:rollup2
CORPORATION WHETHER THEY EARN IT

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:04.302 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. OR ABROAD WAS TAXED

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.403 region:rollup2
IN SORT OF TOTALED UP BUT THE

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:08.173 region:rollup2
INCOME OF THEIR OVERSEAS

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:09.574 region:rollup2
AFFILIATES WAS NOT TAXED UNTIL

00:35:08.173 --> 00:35:10.909 region:rollup2
IT'S PULLED BACK INTO THE U. S..

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:12.444 region:rollup2
LIFE WITH THE DOING NOW IS A

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:14.479 region:rollup2
SORT OF GETTING RID OF THAT IN.

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:16.181 region:rollup2
TREATING THE U. S. AFFILIATE

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:17.449 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY SEPARATELY FOR THE

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.416 region:rollup2
FOREIGN AFFILIATE BUT.

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:20.051 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:20.285 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS HAD A LOT OF MONEY

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.620 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.954 region:rollup2
.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.422 region:rollup2
STORED UP IN THEIR OVERSEAS

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:26.057 region:rollup2
AFFILIATES THAT HADN'T BEEN

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:28.093 region:rollup2
TAXED YET WITH THE DOING IS

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:30.295 region:rollup2
IMPOSING A ONE TIME TAX ON THAT

00:35:28.093 --> 00:35:32.163 region:rollup2
AT A MUCH LOWER RATE. THAN THE A

00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:33.565 region:rollup2
CURRENT CORPORATE RATE.

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:35.300 region:rollup2
BUT AFTER THAT IT JUST SORT OF

00:35:33.565 --> 00:35:36.735 region:rollup2
GOES AWAY AND IT BECOMES SOME.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.136 region:rollup2
JUST INCOME OF THEIR FOREIGN

00:35:36.735 --> 00:35:39.604 region:rollup2
AFFILIATES WHICH IS IN.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.972 region:rollup2
WE JUST TREAT AS A COMPLETELY

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:43.375 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ENTITY NOW FROM THEIR A

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.942 region:rollup2
U. S. AFFILIATE.

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:49.347 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE LAST SLIDE I

00:35:43.942 --> 00:35:50.515 region:rollup2
HAVE.

I CHIU FIRST ON SLIDE FOR AND I

THINK THIS IS I AGREE A GREAT

00:36:54.012 --> 00:36:55.680 region:rollup2
PLACE TO START. YOU MIGHT SAY

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.548 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT THIS

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.316 region:rollup2
AYE THIS FAMILY IS EXPERIENCING

00:36:56.548 --> 00:37:00.318 region:rollup2
A AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:02.320 region:rollup2
DECREASE IN THEIR NET TAX

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:04.389 region:rollup2
LIABILITY. AND MOST TELEPHONES

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.591 region:rollup2
WILL SEE THEIR TAX BILLS GO DOWN

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:08.059 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY FILE IN APRIL OF

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:10.128 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINETEEN.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:13.631 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:16.434 region:rollup2
WELL. THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:18.136 region:rollup2
ONE IS ON WHERE'S THAT IF TWO

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:20.071 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE BY NO

00:37:18.136 --> 00:37:22.740 region:rollup2
LONGER GOING FROM THIS FAMILY TO

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:23.541 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.209 region:rollup2
OUT WILL WHAT'S THE FEDERAL

00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:25.410 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT BUT I DO NOW IT'S GOT

00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:26.745 region:rollup2
LESS MONEY IT'S IT'S GOT TWO

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.247 region:rollup2
OPTIONS ONE IT COULD RAISE TAXES

00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:30.515 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE. BY IN WHICH CASE

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:32.484 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A TWO THOUSAND

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:35.086 region:rollup2
DOLLAR GAIN NOW FOR THE FAMILY

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:36.621 region:rollup2
BUT I THERE ARE THE PARENTS OR

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.989 region:rollup2
THEIR KIDS DOWN THE ROAD ARE

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:39.591 region:rollup2
GOING TO PAY MORE SO IF THEY

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.191 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'RE BETTER OFF. BY

00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.326 region:rollup2
THEN THEY'RE LIVING UNDER AN

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:43.661 region:rollup2
ILLUSION.

00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:45.764 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THE

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:47.532 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL I THINK

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:50.268 region:rollup2
WE'LL JUST SPEND LESS RIGHT WE

00:37:47.532 --> 00:37:51.569 region:rollup2
WILL SEE FEDERAL LEVEL PUBLIC

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.604 region:rollup2
SECTOR DISINVESTMENT.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.204 region:rollup2
I AND IF THAT'S THE CASE WILL

00:37:52.604 --> 00:37:55.473 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE TO PICK UP THE

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:57.342 region:rollup2
SLACK ON AND HISTORICALLY THAT

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:58.743 region:rollup2
HAS FALLEN TO STATE AND LOCAL

00:37:57.342 --> 00:38:00.411 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS.

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:02.213 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY AT THE AT THE

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:03.414 region:rollup2
HIGH END IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:05.049 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEE PEOPLE'S MARGINAL

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:06.985 region:rollup2
RATES GOING UP.

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:08.219 region:rollup2
TOP STATUTORY RATE WENT DOWN

00:38:06.985 --> 00:38:09.888 region:rollup2
FROM THIRTY NINE POINT SIX

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:11.256 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT

00:38:09.888 --> 00:38:12.791 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU'RE A HIGH BRACKET

00:38:11.256 --> 00:38:15.160 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:17.462 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY FOR ANOTHER DOLLAR

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.764 region:rollup2
YOU AREN'T YOU WOULD PAY OFF

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:21.399 region:rollup2
FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT CENTS IN

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:23.168 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA INCOME AND FEDERAL

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:24.602 region:rollup2
INCOME TAXES.

00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE POINT SIX PERCENT

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.704 region:rollup2
PLUS ONE POINT TWO PERCENT FOR

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:29.941 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED.

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:32.043 region:rollup2
THAT THE PEACE PROVISION BOMB

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:33.645 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOW GONE AWAY ARM AND

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:35.346 region:rollup2
THEN YOU WOULD PAY AN ADDITIONAL

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:37.415 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT AT

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:38.683 region:rollup2
THE TOP RATED CALIFORNIA. BOMB

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:40.919 region:rollup2
BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:42.954 region:rollup2
DEDUCT THAT AGAINST YOUR FEDERAL

00:38:40.919 --> 00:38:44.022 region:rollup2
TAXES SO IT WOULD BE AS IF

00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:46.090 region:rollup2
YOU'RE PAYING A PERCENT

00:38:44.022 --> 00:38:47.458 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TAX RATE AFTER YOU

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.059 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN THE FEDERAL DEDUCTIONS

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:48.927 region:rollup2
THAT TOTALS UP TO FORTY EIGHT

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:50.161 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT.

00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:51.729 region:rollup2
NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TAUGHT FEDERAL

00:38:50.161 --> 00:38:53.498 region:rollup2
RATE IS THIRTY SEVEN

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:54.832 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE STE PAIN THIRTEEN

00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:56.334 region:rollup2
POINT THREE TO CALIFORNIA AND

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:58.102 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT DEDUCTING THAT.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:59.804 region:rollup2
BUT SO YOUR TOP MARGINAL RATE IS

00:38:58.102 --> 00:39:00.405 region:rollup2
GOING FROM FORTY EIGHT POINT

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:01.840 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT TO FIFTY POINT

00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:03.007 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT TO ACTUALLY DO YOU

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.742 region:rollup2
SEE FOR SOME PEOPLE IN

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:05.743 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AN INCREASE AYE IN

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.477 region:rollup2
MARGINAL RATES IN THE MARGINAL

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.812 region:rollup2
RATES THAT THEY SHOULD THINK

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.713 region:rollup2
ABOUT IF THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.714 region:rollup2
WHAT HOW MUCH. IS THE GOVERNMENT

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:12.116 region:rollup2
MANY TAKE FOR MY NEXT

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:13.484 region:rollup2
I NEXT DOLLAR.

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:15.453 region:rollup2
AND FOR A LARGE PORTION OF

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:17.755 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WE SEE AN INCREASE

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:19.190 region:rollup2
IN THE AFTER TAX PRICE OF STATE

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:20.858 region:rollup2
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.527 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF I WERE A

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:23.995 region:rollup2
TOP BRACKET TAXPAYER AND I WERE

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:25.763 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL AN

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:28.800 region:rollup2
EXTRA DOLLAR. OF CALIFORNIA

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:31.169 region:rollup2
SPENDING COST ME WELL I WOULD

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.637 region:rollup2
PAN EXTRA DOLLAR IN STATE TAXES

00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:34.172 region:rollup2
TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN I WOULD

00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:35.707 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO CLAIM A THIRTY NINE

00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:37.942 region:rollup2
POINT SIX PERCENT DEDUCTION CALL

00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:39.611 region:rollup2
IT FORTY PERCENT. SO ESSENTIALLY

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:41.512 region:rollup2
I AM PAYING SIXTY SET SIXTY

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:43.281 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR CENTS FOR EXTRA

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.749 region:rollup2
DOLLAR OF STATE LOCAL PUBLIC

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:45.817 region:rollup2
GOODS AND SERVICES.

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:47.418 region:rollup2
ONCE I GET OVER THE TEN THOUSAND

00:39:45.817 --> 00:39:49.287 region:rollup2
DOLLAR CAP NOW I'M PAYING A

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:50.521 region:rollup2
DOLLAR FOR AN EXTRA DOLLAR OF

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:51.689 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL. PUBLIC GOODS

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:54.092 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES AND THIS AFFECTS

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:55.426 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE HIT BY

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:56.995 region:rollup2
THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP. BUT

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:59.330 region:rollup2
A HUGE PORTION THE POPULATION IS

00:39:56.995 --> 00:40:00.632 region:rollup2
GOING TO SHIFT FROM ITEMIZING TO

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.966 region:rollup2
CLAIMING THE STANDARD DEDUCTIONS

00:40:00.632 --> 00:40:03.668 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT NOW ABOUT A THIRD OF

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.335 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ITEMIZE ON THEIR TAX

00:40:03.668 --> 00:40:05.370 region:rollup2
RETURNS.

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:06.571 region:rollup2
I BUT WITH THE STANDARD

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.839 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION GOING UP TO TWENTY

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:09.374 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:12.043 region:rollup2
MARRIED COUPLE.

00:40:09.374 --> 00:40:13.745 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOT THAT DOESN'T MAKE

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:15.580 region:rollup2
THE MARRIED COUPLE WITH TWO KIDS

00:40:13.745 --> 00:40:17.081 region:rollup2
ARE BETTER OFF NOT BECAUSE

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.083 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOSING PERSONAL

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:20.051 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS BUT IT

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.419 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO

00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.720 region:rollup2
ITEMIZE IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN

00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.888 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.156 region:rollup2
ITEMIZED DEDUCTION.

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.824 region:rollup2
AND FEWER THAN THE OTHER

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:29.193 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY ONE TENTH OF THE

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:30.094 region:rollup2
POPULATION WILL ITEMIZE UNDER

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.430 region:rollup2
THE NEW REGIME SO WE'RE GOING

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:33.765 region:rollup2
FROM A THIRD TO ONE TASK SO FOR

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.534 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:37.235 region:rollup2
ITEMIZING. FOR THEM THE AFTER

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:37.969 region:rollup2
TAX PRICE OF STATE LOCAL

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:40.171 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.873 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS GOING UP

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.308 region:rollup2
A LOT BUT AND THIS IS AT A TIME

00:40:41.873 --> 00:40:45.043 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ARE ASKING STATE AND

00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:46.344 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO MORE

00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:48.713 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A FEDERAL LEVEL PUBLIC

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:50.081 region:rollup2
SECTOR. AYE DISINVESTMENT.

00:40:48.713 --> 00:40:51.749 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S I THINK GOOD

00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:53.418 region:rollup2
ECONOMETRIC RESEARCH ON HOW

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:55.787 region:rollup2
STATE IN STATES AND LOCALITIES

00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:57.622 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO ARE THE INCENTIVES

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:59.357 region:rollup2
CREATED BY FEDERAL TAX LAW AND I

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.591 region:rollup2
THINK THEY DO RESPOND THOUGH YOU

00:40:59.357 --> 00:41:02.727 region:rollup2
CAN GET A BUNCH OF ECONOMISTS IN

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:04.228 region:rollup2
THE ROOM. AND BY.

00:41:02.727 --> 00:41:06.464 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:08.1000 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STORIES NAM ON THAT.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:09.634 region:rollup2
ONE INTUITIVELY WELL WHEN THE

00:41:08.1000 --> 00:41:10.134 region:rollup2
PRICE OF A GOOD OR SERVICE GOES

00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:12.270 region:rollup2
UP.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:13.137 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BY LAST.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.605 region:rollup2
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS IS

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:16.274 region:rollup2
DOING IS FOR A LARGE PORTION OF

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:18.242 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:19.444 region:rollup2
RAISING THE PRICE A PUBLIC

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:21.145 region:rollup2
SECTOR PROVIDED GOODS AND

00:41:19.444 --> 00:41:23.081 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:25.450 region:rollup2
I.

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:27.018 region:rollup2
SO IS THIS A PROBLEM OUT WHY

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.386 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT IT WELL

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:29.187 region:rollup2
MORE THAN HALF OF STATE AND

00:41:28.386 --> 00:41:31.022 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING HERE

00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:32.757 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER

00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
STATES GOES TOWARD HUMAN CAPITAL

00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:36.327 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.295 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ADVOCATED TWELVE LEVEL

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2
AND AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION

00:41:37.295 --> 00:41:41.999 region:rollup2
LEVEL. AND HEALTH CARE.

00:41:40.298 --> 00:41:43.267 region:rollup2
WE HAVE HERE AS I JUST AND

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.569 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT A SHIFT TOWARD

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:46.070 region:rollup2
EXPENSING WHICH IS IN IMMEDIATE

00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:47.705 region:rollup2
RIGHT OFF FOR NEW INVESTMENT IN

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.439 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL CAPITAL.

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:50.274 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT THAT WE'RE MOVING

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:51.909 region:rollup2
TOWARD AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT OFF

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
FOR NEW INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:55.780 region:rollup2
CAPITAL BUT DENYING A DEDUCTION

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:57.215 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHO ARE

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.683 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY INVESTING IN HUMAN

00:41:57.215 --> 00:42:00.451 region:rollup2
CAPITAL? THROUGH STATES AND

00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:03.054 region:rollup2
LOCALITIES.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:04.021 region:rollup2
A MOREOVER NOT CONGRESS DECIDED

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:05.023 region:rollup2
THAT IT ONE TO PRESERVE THE

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:06.391 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO PAY FOR

00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:07.925 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE

00:42:06.391 --> 00:42:09.894 region:rollup2
WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:10.461 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BY KEEPING THE EXCLUSION

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:11.696 region:rollup2
FOR EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.197 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

00:42:11.696 --> 00:42:14.966 region:rollup2
I AND BY ACTUALLY EXPANDING THE

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:16.601 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EXPENSE DEDUCTION.

00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:18.102 region:rollup2
WELL IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER

00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:20.471 region:rollup2
STATES THAT INVEST ROBUSTLY IN

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:21.272 region:rollup2
THEIR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS.

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:23.107 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT WE PAY FOR

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:24.642 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE IS TO STAY LEVEL TAX.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:26.044 region:rollup2
BOB WEIR WE RIPPING AWAY THE

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:27.011 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO PAY FOR

00:42:26.044 --> 00:42:28.880 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE WITH FEDERALLY

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:31.349 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.217 region:rollup2
AND MOREOVER OUT ONE OF THE

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.318 region:rollup2
GOALS OF THAT TAX REFORM WAS CHU

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.553 region:rollup2
I CONTINUE TO PROMOTE

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:36.587 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP THAT WAS WHY THE

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.022 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:39.023 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GO AWAY AND IT THAT THE

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.425 region:rollup2
ROLLBACK OF THE MORTGAGE

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:41.759 region:rollup2
INTEREST DEDUCTION AFFECTS A

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:43.227 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:44.729 region:rollup2
PEOPLE EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:46.431 region:rollup2
I MEAN A CALIFORNIA HAS MORE

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:48.032 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE WITH

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.100 region:rollup2
A MORTGAGE LOANS OVER SEVEN

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.170 region:rollup2
OR STILL TALKING ABOUT A PRETTY

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:53.438 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME SET. BUT FOR A LOT

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.305 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE IT'S ACTUALLY THE

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION FOR STATE LOCAL

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:57.909 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES THAT IS THE ONE

00:42:56.107 --> 00:42:58.910 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX INCENTIVE THAT THEY

00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:00.511 region:rollup2
GET FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.280 region:rollup2
I THEY GET IF THEY OWN THEIR OWN

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:03.347 region:rollup2
HOME NOT IF THEY RENT AND AFTER

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.916 region:rollup2
THEY PAY DOWN THEIR MORTGAGE

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:05.850 region:rollup2
LOAN THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:08.252 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:11.122 region:rollup2
ANYMORE SO THAT INCENTIVE FOR A

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:12.890 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS GOING AWAY.

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:14.792 region:rollup2
OKAY SO HOW DO WE PRESERVE THE

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.727 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO PAY

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:18.029 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:19.163 region:rollup2
PROVIDED BY STATE LOCAL

00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:20.832 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS WITH FEDERALLY

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:22.233 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS IF CALIFORNIA

00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:23.835 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S ARE A

00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:25.470 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE GOAL. THEIR THREE

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:27.104 region:rollup2
APPROACHES THAT STATES HAVE BEEN

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:30.441 region:rollup2
TAKING.

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:31.375 region:rollup2
ONE IS ARE A PAYROLL TAX SHIFT.

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.810 region:rollup2
BUT IN NEW YORK HAS BEEN THE

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:35.513 region:rollup2
LEADER ON THE S.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.647 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA IS PREVIOUSLY LET'S

00:43:35.513 --> 00:43:37.682 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YOU HAD A FIVE PERCENT

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:39.450 region:rollup2
STATE TAX RATE.

00:43:37.682 --> 00:43:40.485 region:rollup2
STATE INCOME TAX RATE.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.553 region:rollup2
YOU ARE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:44.122 region:rollup2
YOUR EMPLOYER.

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:46.524 region:rollup2
FIVE DOLLARS GOES TO THE STATE

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:47.558 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE DOLLARS GOES TO YOU.

00:43:46.524 --> 00:43:49.494 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN CLAIM THE SAME LOCAL

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:50.094 region:rollup2
TAX DEDUCTION YOUR FEDERAL

00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:51.562 region:rollup2
TAXABLE INCOME IS NINETY FIVE

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:52.864 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:54.165 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE TAKING THE ABILITY OF

00:43:52.864 --> 00:43:55.766 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:43:54.165 --> 00:43:57.068 region:rollup2
TO DEDUCT

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:58.603 region:rollup2
WELL WHY NOT JUST SAY TO MY

00:43:57.068 --> 00:44:00.138 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER WHILE YOU PAY ME NINETY

00:43:58.603 --> 00:44:02.140 region:rollup2
FIVE.

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:04.275 region:rollup2
YOU PAY FIVE TO THE STATE.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.611 region:rollup2
MY GROSS INCOME FOR FEDERAL TAX

00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:09.347 region:rollup2
PURPOSES IS NINETY FIVE.

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:10.948 region:rollup2
I'M NO WORSE OFF BEFORE ACTUALLY

00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:12.650 region:rollup2
I'M BETTER OFF BEFORE I THAN

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:13.551 region:rollup2
BEFORE ON BECAUSE NOW WE'RE

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.653 region:rollup2
BETTER OFF THAN I WOULD BE UNDER

00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:16.721 region:rollup2
THE NEW TRUMP TAX PLAN BECAUSE

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:17.321 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAXING

00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:18.723 region:rollup2
ME ON NINETY FIVE RATHER THAN

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:20.892 region:rollup2
HUNT.

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.527 region:rollup2
AND MY EMPLOYER IS JUST AS HAPPY

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:23.628 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY KNEW TAX LAW

00:44:22.527 --> 00:44:25.930 region:rollup2
PRESERVES THE ABILITY OF

00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:27.732 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT STAY MOBILE

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.100 region:rollup2
TAX.

00:44:27.732 --> 00:44:31.269 region:rollup2
SO THIS WORKS THIS IS REALLY

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.004 region:rollup2
EASY TO IMPLEMENT IN A FLAT TAX

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:34.672 region:rollup2
STATE LIKE ILLINOIS. BUT IT IS A

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:36.407 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLICATED IN

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:38.309 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE TAX STATES LIKE NEW

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:39.677 region:rollup2
YORK IN CALIFORNIA NEW YORK IS

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:42.079 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN LISTED A WHOLE BUNCH

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:43.981 region:rollup2
OF ACADEMICS BY IN DEVELOPING A

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:45.783 region:rollup2
CREDIT APPROACH.

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.951 region:rollup2
I THAT WOULD ALLOW IT WOULD KEEP

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:48.986 region:rollup2
THE INCOME TAX IN PLACE

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:51.055 region:rollup2
WE WOULD IMPOSE A PAYROLL TAX ON

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:52.623 region:rollup2
WAGES INDIVIDUALS WITH THEN GET

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:54.892 region:rollup2
TO CLAIM A CREDIT AGAINST SATAN

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:56.594 region:rollup2
A STATE INCOME TAXES FOR THE

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:58.462 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAXES PAID BY THE

00:44:56.594 --> 00:45:01.065 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER. AND NEW YORK IS FIGURE

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:01.632 region:rollup2
OUT A FORMULA AND I'M HAPPY TO

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.700 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE DETAILS OF IT

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:04.168 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.303 region:rollup2
CREATES A PROGRESSIVE CREDIT

00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.270 region:rollup2
THAT BEN PRESERVES THE

00:45:05.303 --> 00:45:07.672 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVITY OF THE OVERALL TAX

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.408 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:12.777 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS ONLY AFFECTS REGION

00:45:10.408 --> 00:45:14.312 region:rollup2
CALM BUT IT ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:16.080 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION IN

00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:17.515 region:rollup2
SOME RESPECTS BEYOND WHERE IT

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.450 region:rollup2
WAS PRE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE

00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:20.985 region:rollup2
REMEMBER PRE SEVEN A PRE TWENTY

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.453 region:rollup2
OR PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIRTY

00:45:20.985 --> 00:45:23.454 region:rollup2
THE POPULATIONS ITEMIZING THAT

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:24.889 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT TWO THIRDS OF PEOPLE

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:25.790 region:rollup2
WEREN'T CLAIM THAT'S A LOCAL TAX

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:26.424 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.358 region:rollup2
THEY WERE CLAIMING THE STANDARD

00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:29.694 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION.

00:45:27.358 --> 00:45:31.629 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD I CHANGE THIS WOULD

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:33.431 region:rollup2
ALLOW EVERYONE WHO GET WARRANTS

00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
WAGES TO PAY WITH FEDERALLY

00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:36.934 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS FOR STATE AND

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.236 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES.

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.804 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE INCREASE YOUR YOUR

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:41.105 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GROSS INCOME GOES FROM A

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:42.540 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TO NINETY FIVE

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:44.208 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU TAKE

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.610 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD DEDUCTION OR YOU

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:47.478 region:rollup2
ITEMIZE THE CHALLENGING

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.779 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S I UNDERSTAND THIS

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.647 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE A TWO

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:52.249 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE.

00:45:49.647 --> 00:45:53.551 region:rollup2
OF UP THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAID

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:56.053 region:rollup2
IT'S A WIN WIN.

00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:58.856 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

00:45:56.053 --> 00:46:00.925 region:rollup2
A WIN FOR US FOR EMPLOYEES WHOSE

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:03.327 region:rollup2
WAGES ARE WHOSE AFTER TAX WAGES

00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:05.162 region:rollup2
WOULD GO UP RIGHT AND BECAUSE

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:07.198 region:rollup2
THEY THEY THEY THEY ALL OF THEM

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:08.899 region:rollup2
COULD NOW CLAIM A FEDERAL TAX

00:46:07.198 --> 00:46:10.501 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION BUT VERY FEW OF THEM.

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:12.737 region:rollup2
WILL CLAIM UNDER THE NEW STATUS

00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:15.106 region:rollup2
QUO AND FROM EMPLOYERS IS

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:15.973 region:rollup2
DESIRABLE BECAUSE IF EMPLOYERS

00:46:15.106 --> 00:46:17.141 region:rollup2
ARE ENOUGH

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:19.644 region:rollup2
APPLE IS TRYING TO LURE AN

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:21.479 region:rollup2
ENGINEER AWAY FROM AYE DALLIN

00:46:19.644 --> 00:46:22.980 region:rollup2
TAXES WELL THE FACT THAT THE

00:46:21.479 --> 00:46:23.981 region:rollup2
SALT DEDUCTION HAS GONE AWAY OR

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.383 region:rollup2
GONE AWAY FOR MOST PEOPLE MAKES

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:27.184 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LESS ATTRACTIVE

00:46:25.383 --> 00:46:28.719 region:rollup2
BUSINESS CLIMATE. IF CALIFORNIA

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:30.054 region:rollup2
CAN EFFECTIVELY BRING BACK THIS

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:31.522 region:rollup2
A LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION FOR

00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:32.390 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA WELL

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:33.791 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.226 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SHOULD WATCH YES NOW

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:37.061 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY PAYING

00:46:35.226 --> 00:46:39.730 region:rollup2
ATTACKS BEFORE THEY WORK.

00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:41.098 region:rollup2
OUR BUT I AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.300 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.834 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD SEEM TO BE BETTER

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.338 region:rollup2
OFF.

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:50.408 region:rollup2
THE SECOND APPROACH AND. IS TO

00:46:47.338 --> 00:46:52.977 region:rollup2
IMPOSE A TAX ON PASS THROUGHS ON

00:46:50.408 --> 00:46:54.545 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS ASK OPERATIONS AYE

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:56.180 region:rollup2
AND SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:57.381 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE PAID OUT THE

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.450 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP LEVEL OR AT THE SOLE

00:46:57.381 --> 00:47:01.052 region:rollup2
PROPRIETORSHIP LEVEL OR AT THE

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.587 region:rollup2
ESCORT LEVEL. AND IT WOULD BE A

00:47:01.052 --> 00:47:04.889 region:rollup2
TAX ON THE ENTITIES AND CON AND

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:06.190 region:rollup2
THEN THE PARTNER THE SOLE

00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:07.291 region:rollup2
PROPRIETOR WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:11.028 region:rollup2
CLAIM.

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:13.864 region:rollup2
A CREDIT ON BY HIS OR HER OWN

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:15.299 region:rollup2
STATE INCOME TAXES UP FOR WHAT

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:17.301 region:rollup2
THE SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP HAS PAID

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:18.836 region:rollup2
NEW YORK ACTUALLY NEW YORK CITY

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:20.838 region:rollup2
ALREADY DOES THIS AND SO IF YOU

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:22.173 region:rollup2
WERE AN UBER DRIVER IN NEW YORK

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:23.407 region:rollup2
CITY. YOU ARE A SOLE

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:25.743 region:rollup2
PROPRIETORSHIP YOUR SOLE

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:27.578 region:rollup2
PROPRIETORSHIP PAYS A TAX TO NEW

00:47:25.743 --> 00:47:30.114 region:rollup2
YORK YOU THEN CLAIM A CREDIT FOR

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:31.349 region:rollup2
IT. ON YOUR NEW YORK CITY INCOME

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:32.883 region:rollup2
TAXES

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:34.852 region:rollup2
I AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:36.220 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS THAT TO BE A TAX PAID

00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:38.122 region:rollup2
BY THE BUSINESS RATHER THAN A

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.989 region:rollup2
TAX PAID BY YOU SO EVEN IF AT

00:47:38.122 --> 00:47:40.391 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE DAY YOU CLAIM THE

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:42.626 region:rollup2
STANDARD DEDUCTION.

00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:44.428 region:rollup2
YOUR THIS STILL ALLOWS YOU TO

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:45.830 region:rollup2
PAY IN NEW YORK LOCAL INCOME

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:47.431 region:rollup2
TAXES WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.899 region:rollup2
DOLLARS

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:51.769 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE PRETTY EASY

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:53.404 region:rollup2
BY IT. TO IMPLEMENT THIS AT THE

00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:55.106 region:rollup2
STATE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE

00:47:53.404 --> 00:47:56.841 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN IS

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:59.677 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE TWO THIRDS.

00:47:56.841 --> 00:48:01.312 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT BUT I. CONNECTICUT

00:47:59.677 --> 00:48:03.013 region:rollup2
IS MOVING FULL SPEED AHEAD ON

00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:04.148 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:07.852 region:rollup2

ADMISSIBILITY. OF THE TAX AND

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.009 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAXES.

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:13.177 region:rollup2
.

00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.612 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW PLUSES AND MINUSES

00:50:13.177 --> 00:50:15.813 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEIR.

00:50:14.612 --> 00:50:17.715 region:rollup2
PLUSES IS THAT THEY'RE

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:19.350 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SIMPLE WAY OF FUNDING

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:19.950 region:rollup2
I'M BROAD BASED SOCIAL SERVICES

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.085 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S HOW WE USE IT FOR

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.753 region:rollup2
HER POINT

00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:24.388 region:rollup2
SHERATON STILL SECURITY.

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:26.757 region:rollup2
AND SO IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:27.958 region:rollup2
ABOUT ON IN TERMS OF WHAT OTHER

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:30.628 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:33.163 region:rollup2
COULD WE DO IF WE ARE GOING TO.

00:50:30.628 --> 00:50:35.666 region:rollup2
USE THE.

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:37.201 region:rollup2
ON WELCOME SPUR OF THIS TAX PLAN

00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:39.270 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE CALIFORNIA'S TAX

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:41.205 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHAT CAN WE DO THAT WE

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:42.539 region:rollup2
MIGHT WANT TO DO YOU ANYWAY.

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:44.241 region:rollup2
SO FOR INSTANCE I'M IN THE

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:46.110 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE CONTEXT THERE ARE A

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.411 region:rollup2
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET THE

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:49.013 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS RIGHT AND DON'T GET

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:50.381 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO

00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:51.815 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE. OF

00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:53.651 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:56.420 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THEM SOME BENEFITS.

00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:57.821 region:rollup2
BY IMPOSING I'M OUT UP SOME

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.023 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THIS PAYROLL TAX

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:00.591 region:rollup2
TOWARDS PROVIDING HEALTH CARE

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:01.492 region:rollup2
CREDITS I'M TO THOSE PEOPLE IN

00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:02.660 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE OF THE AISLE THAT

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:04.295 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT'S JUST A

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:07.164 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BUT THE IDEA IS THAT.

00:51:04.295 --> 00:51:08.732 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD TRY TO VIEW WHAT I'M

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:10.134 region:rollup2
THIS TAX PLAN IS FORCING US TO

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:11.902 region:rollup2
DO IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE

00:51:10.134 --> 00:51:14.872 region:rollup2
THINGS BETTER AND NOT BE POORLY

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:16.707 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE. ANOTHER ON BENEFIT.

00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:18.442 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT TERMS OF THE ENTITY

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:20.210 region:rollup2
LEVEL TAXATION SORT OF THE NEW

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:22.112 region:rollup2
YORK UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.213 region:rollup2
IS TO REMEMBER THAT THE.

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.949 region:rollup2
TRUMP TAX PLAN CREATES THIS

00:51:23.213 --> 00:51:26.050 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT ON DEDUCTION

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:28.719 region:rollup2
FIRST I'M QUALIFIED BUSINESS

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:30.487 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:51:28.719 --> 00:51:31.689 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN A LOT OF CASES.

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:33.123 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THAT'S A

00:51:31.689 --> 00:51:35.392 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD IDEA.

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:35.993 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE WERE GOING TO

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:38.162 region:rollup2
IMPOSE IT.

00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:39.496 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN CORPORATE BUSINESS TAX

00:51:38.162 --> 00:51:40.731 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF I'M A BUSINESS ACT

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:42.466 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:43.801 region:rollup2
CLAW BACK ON SOME SOME OF THOSE

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:46.103 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

00:51:43.801 --> 00:51:48.539 region:rollup2
AND FURTHERMORE THERE'S A LARGER

00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:50.274 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS AS TO WHY AS IT IS

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:52.142 region:rollup2
WE TAX CORPORATIONS.

00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:53.444 region:rollup2
AND NOT OTHER LARGE BUSINESS

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:54.845 region:rollup2
ENTITIES SO AGAIN BEFORE

00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:56.246 region:rollup2
THINKING OF CHANGING

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:59.016 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM IN

00:51:56.246 --> 00:52:00.284 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THIS DE. ALL CHANGES

00:51:59.016 --> 00:52:01.919 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:03.153 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT TO DO ANYWAY

00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:04.822 region:rollup2
SO TO THE SAYS THERE ARE ONLY

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:06.357 region:rollup2
TAXING CORPORATIONS AND OTHER

00:52:04.822 --> 00:52:07.591 region:rollup2
LARGE BUSINESSES. THERE WAS

00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:08.559 region:rollup2
NEVER A GOOD REASON TO DO THAT

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.927 region:rollup2
OVER GOING TO HAPPEN

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:10.861 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS TAX

00:52:09.927 --> 00:52:12.496 region:rollup2
LET'S HAVE OF.

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:13.897 region:rollup2
ATTACKS ON LARGE INCORPORATED

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.599 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES TO PUT THEM ON A

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:17.935 region:rollup2
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD CORPORATIONS

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:18.469 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE EVEN CLUB BACK ON SOME

00:52:17.935 --> 00:52:18.702 region:rollup2
OF THE QUALIFIED BUSINESS

00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:21.138 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:23.340 region:rollup2
PERHAPS.

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:25.409 region:rollup2
OKAY SO I WANNA FOCUS A LITTLE

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.810 region:rollup2
BIT ON THE THIRD I'M OPTION THE

00:52:25.409 --> 00:52:28.412 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S GOTTEN FROM THEM OF

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.713 region:rollup2
THE FARTHEST LEGISLATIVELY HERE

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:32.683 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S USING

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:34.318 region:rollup2
CHARITABLE CREDITS. THE.

00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:36.286 region:rollup2
COME NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW AS WE

00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:37.755 region:rollup2
NOW KNOW PERHAPS THE STATE LOCAL

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:39.623 region:rollup2
TAX DEDUCTION IT DOES NOT CAP

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:40.791 region:rollup2
THE CHARITABLE.

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:42.893 region:rollup2
THE CHARITABLE DEDUCTION IS ALSO

00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:44.228 region:rollup2
AN ITEMIZED DEDUCTION AND OF THE

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:45.963 region:rollup2
A PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE INTERNAL

00:52:44.228 --> 00:52:46.997 region:rollup2
REVENUE CODE SAYS YOU CAN DEDUCT

00:52:45.963 --> 00:52:48.365 region:rollup2
A CONTRIBUTION TO A STATE LAW

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:51.902 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:54.338 region:rollup2
AND SO THE IDEA IS TO ARM PERMIT

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:56.140 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS TO I'M GIVE TARGETED

00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:57.141 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS ON TO STATE AND

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.642 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RETURN FOR

00:52:57.141 --> 00:53:00.144 region:rollup2
AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:02.179 region:rollup2
SPENT TWO I'M ROUGHLY

00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:02.780 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZING THE BILL'S WHO SORT

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:03.881 region:rollup2
OF COMING FROM THE SENATE SIDE

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.948 region:rollup2
S. B. TO

00:53:03.881 --> 00:53:06.283 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN S. B. FIVE EIGHTY

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:08.552 region:rollup2
ONE SO AGAIN.

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:09.153 region:rollup2
A TAXPAYER MAKES A CONTRIBUTION

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.521 region:rollup2
TO.

00:53:09.153 --> 00:53:11.689 region:rollup2
A STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.824 region:rollup2
.

00:53:11.689 --> 00:53:15.392 region:rollup2
AND GETS AND EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT

00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:17.528 region:rollup2
CREDIT AND THEN THEY GET TO

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:18.896 region:rollup2
DIRECT SOME OF THEIR FUNDS

00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:20.297 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A PARTICULAR PROGRAM

00:53:18.896 --> 00:53:22.166 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THE COMPONENT IS.

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:23.801 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT CREDIT WHICH

00:53:22.166 --> 00:53:25.736 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT. THE STATE.

00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:28.105 region:rollup2
THAT'S MONEY RIGHT THE TAXPAYER

00:53:25.736 --> 00:53:30.407 region:rollup2
IS GIVING MORE THE TAXPAYER GETS

00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:31.275 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DIRECTION BY DISTANCE

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:33.877 region:rollup2
TO SAY WHERE THE MONEY'S OING

00:53:31.275 --> 00:53:35.412 region:rollup2
TO GO. TO TAXPAYERS BETTER OFF

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:37.481 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVEN AT EIGHTY FIVE

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:38.515 region:rollup2
PERCENT CREDIT IF THEY'RE IN THE

00:53:37.481 --> 00:53:40.084 region:rollup2
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TAX BRACKET

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:41.685 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST MARGINAL RATE.

00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:42.286 region:rollup2
THEY'LL STILL DOING WELL AT THE

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.253 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'D

00:53:42.286 --> 00:53:44.922 region:rollup2
ADOPTION

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:45.756 region:rollup2
GREATER ON THEN THE AMOUNT OF

00:53:44.922 --> 00:53:47.558 region:rollup2
THE ADDITIONAL DOCTOR PAY TO

00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:49.426 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:51.428 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE BASIC IDEA AND THE

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:53.097 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS.

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:55.232 region:rollup2
DOES THAT WORK RIGHT WHAT IS TO

00:53:53.097 --> 00:53:57.634 region:rollup2
I'M I'M LEGAL STATUS OF THE.

00:53:55.232 --> 00:53:58.936 region:rollup2
SURE AND SO.

00:53:57.634 --> 00:54:00.704 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN GO REALLY DEEP IN THE

00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:01.271 region:rollup2
WEEDS ON THIS BUT THE BASIC IDEA

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:04.675 region:rollup2
IS THAT. ARE THE CONCERN IS

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:06.210 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:54:04.675 --> 00:54:07.978 region:rollup2
THE STATE IS BASICALLY GIVING

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:08.145 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BACK TO THE.

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.980 region:rollup2
SO.

00:54:08.145 --> 00:54:11.248 region:rollup2
.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.616 region:rollup2
HOW CAN THAT BE A CHARITABLE

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:13.684 region:rollup2
DONATION RIGHT IF THE STATE IS

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:15.486 region:rollup2
GIVING YOU EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT

00:54:13.684 --> 00:54:16.787 region:rollup2
OF THE CREDIT UP TO

00:54:15.486 --> 00:54:18.288 region:rollup2
STILL THE NATION BACK IT CAN'T

00:54:16.787 --> 00:54:20.691 region:rollup2
BE ACCOUNTABLE CONTRIBUTION? AND

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:22.392 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER IS HOW THE TAX CODE

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:23.994 region:rollup2
ANALYZE HIS TAX CUT

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.928 region:rollup2
SO FOR INSTANCE.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.898 region:rollup2
WHEN NEVADA.

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:29.066 region:rollup2
GAVE BIG TAX CREDITS TO TESLA

00:54:27.898 --> 00:54:31.368 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:33.670 region:rollup2
SAY OH WELL TESLA YOU AVOIDED

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:35.372 region:rollup2
ALL THAT TAX IN THE BONTA. THAT

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:37.074 region:rollup2
COUNTS AS INCOME TO YOU WHAT

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:38.776 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO TAX YOU ON THE

00:54:37.074 --> 00:54:40.511 region:rollup2
INCOME YOU AVOID IT RIGHT THAT'S

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:42.012 region:rollup2
NOT HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:54:40.511 --> 00:54:44.014 region:rollup2
AT THE FEDERAL TAX CODE.

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:45.883 region:rollup2
CONCEIVES OF STATE LOCAL TAXES

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:47.651 region:rollup2
RIGHT A CONCEIVES OF THESE TAX

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:49.453 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES TO HAVE A STATE OF

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:51.789 region:rollup2
PALESTINE OVER. DECIDING TO

00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:54.525 region:rollup2
REDUCE YOUR TAX LIABILITY RIGHT

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:56.627 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT CONCEIVED OF AS MONEY

00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:59.296 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAD AND THEN DIDN'T PAY

00:54:56.627 --> 00:55:01.899 region:rollup2
AND SO. THAT RULE IS FAIRLY WELL

00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:02.499 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED IN FEDERAL TAX LAW

00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:04.134 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:06.537 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:07.905 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS IN THIRTY STATES

00:55:06.537 --> 00:55:11.608 region:rollup2
THAT GIVE SUBSTANTIAL CREDITS.

00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:12.776 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE ETERNAL IRIS

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:14.444 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS PARTICULAR.

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:15.712 region:rollup2
MEMORANDUM WHICH IF COUNSEL'S

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:16.947 region:rollup2
OFFICE ARTICULATING THIS

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:19.016 region:rollup2
POSITION.

00:55:16.947 --> 00:55:20.851 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN IF A CREDIT IS ONE

00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:23.187 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT THE.

00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:25.088 region:rollup2
IRIS IS POSITION AGAIN BORROWING

00:55:23.187 --> 00:55:27.224 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A PROVISO THEIR

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:28.926 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE.

00:55:27.224 --> 00:55:30.627 region:rollup2
CLEARLY IN AN AREA THAT WE HAVE

00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:30.861 region:rollup2
TO BE VERY AWARE OF RIGHT THIS

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.095 region:rollup2
IS NOT.

00:55:30.861 --> 00:55:33.797 region:rollup2
.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:35.032 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS UNASSAILABLE

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.632 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ONE REASON WE HAVE TO

00:55:35.032 --> 00:55:38.035 region:rollup2
THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW WE

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:39.970 region:rollup2
DESIGN. OUR PROGRAM BUT FOR THE

00:55:38.035 --> 00:55:41.271 region:rollup2
MOST PART CREDITS ARE TREATED AS

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:43.707 region:rollup2
A REDUCTION OF STATE AND LOCAL

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:45.475 region:rollup2
TAX LIABILITY AND NOT AS INCOME

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:46.944 region:rollup2
TO THE TAXPAYER AND THAT RULE IS

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:49.379 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS

00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:50.514 region:rollup2
NOT JUST. THIS CONTEXT SO FOR

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:52.549 region:rollup2
INSTANCE A LOT OF CREDITS ARE

00:55:50.514 --> 00:55:54.251 region:rollup2
TRANSFERABLE.

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:55.852 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU TRANSFER CREDIT

00:55:54.251 --> 00:55:57.354 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.488 region:rollup2
BASIS IN THE CREDIT THIS IS SORT

00:55:57.354 --> 00:56:00.624 region:rollup2
OF IN THE WEEDS TAX.

00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:01.892 region:rollup2
POLICY BUT IF THE CREDIT GIVEN

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:03.527 region:rollup2
TO YOU WAS TREATED AS INCOME TO

00:56:01.892 --> 00:56:04.928 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.996 region:rollup2
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE A BASIS IN

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:07.297 region:rollup2
THAT TAX CREDIT BECAUSE IT'S

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:09.032 region:rollup2
LIKE THE GOVERNMENT GAVE YOU TEN

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:10.400 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TAX BREAKS

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:11.902 region:rollup2
AND YOU PAY TAX ON IT. AND THEN

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.003 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GO ON TO SELL IT YOU

00:56:11.902 --> 00:56:14.304 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT TEN

00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:15.906 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK.

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:17.341 region:rollup2
THAT'S NEVER BEEN THE WAY THE

00:56:15.906 --> 00:56:19.843 region:rollup2
IRS IS TREATED THESE.

00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:21.879 region:rollup2
SINCE SO.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:24.181 region:rollup2
THERE'S UP. GET A STRONG AND

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:25.883 region:rollup2
LEGAL FOUNDATION NOT YOU KNOW.

00:56:24.181 --> 00:56:27.584 region:rollup2
DID THIS PARTICULAR CASE HAS

00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:29.586 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN POLITICALLY CRISIS

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:30.053 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THAT BUT

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:31.188 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STRONG LEGAL

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:32.522 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION THAT.

00:56:31.188 --> 00:56:34.024 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS ARE TREATED AS

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:36.260 region:rollup2
REDUCTION AND NOT HIS INCOME

00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:38.228 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.264 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:41.632 region:rollup2
THAT THE TAXPAYER IS ACTUALLY

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:43.433 region:rollup2
CHANGING THEIR POSITION VIS A

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:45.769 region:rollup2
VIS THE STATE AT PARTICIPATING

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:47.671 region:rollup2
MORE. INFANTRY IT CONTRIBUTED TO

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:49.606 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS GOING

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:51.041 region:rollup2
TO BE ON A STRONG RIGHT THOUGH

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:52.409 region:rollup2
NOT UNASSAILABLE POSITION

00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS

00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:54.745 region:rollup2
OR OR. OP APPROACHES TO

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:56.713 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:58.048 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:59.349 region:rollup2
ARIZONA HAS A PROGRAM WITH A

00:56:58.048 --> 00:57:00.784 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT CREDIT THAT YOU

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:02.219 region:rollup2
CAN GIVE TO YOU I'M STUDENT

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:03.420 region:rollup2
TUITION ORGANIZATIONS AND THOSE

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:05.055 region:rollup2
STUDENT TUITION ORGANIZATIONS

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.957 region:rollup2
CAN ACTUALLY USE THAT MONEY. TO

00:57:05.055 --> 00:57:08.892 region:rollup2
SEND STUDENTS TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:10.661 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SECTARIAN SCHOOLS

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:11.928 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION WAS WELL. CAN

00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.196 region:rollup2
YOU DO THAT AT THAT VIOLATE THE

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:14.831 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:17.301 region:rollup2
ISN'T THAT SPENDING PUBLIC

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:18.402 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ON IN SUPPORT TOP

00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:19.236 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION THE WENT

00:57:18.402 --> 00:57:20.804 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME

00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:23.607 region:rollup2
COURT AND ACTUALLY TO STANDING

00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:24.207 region:rollup2
CASE. OF IT BUT THE UPSHOT IS

00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:24.841 region:rollup2
THE SUPREME COURT SAID IF YOU

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.375 region:rollup2
USE CREE

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:27.744 region:rollup2
GOV CREDIT IS NOT SPENDING

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:29.513 region:rollup2
MONEY.

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:30.781 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S A REDUCTION OF TAX

00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:33.283 region:rollup2
LIABILITY AND SO DOES NOT

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:35.585 region:rollup2
VIOLATE THE ESTO.

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:38.855 region:rollup2
AND SO ULTIMATELY ARIZONA

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:40.957 region:rollup2
ARIZONA'S PROGRAM WAS ON UPHELD.

00:57:38.855 --> 00:57:43.527 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS IN EFFECT THAT YOU

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:45.162 region:rollup2
CAN CURRENTLY USE TAX CREDITS A

00:57:43.527 --> 00:57:46.863 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT TAX CREDITS I'M

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:48.332 region:rollup2
TO FUND PRIVATE AND SECTARIAN

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:49.666 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND SO WHAT THE

00:57:48.332 --> 00:57:51.468 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. IS

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:53.403 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SAYING IS IF YOU CAN

00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:55.138 region:rollup2
USE ALMOST LARGE TAX CREDITS TO

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:56.640 region:rollup2
FUND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HOW COULD

00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:58.542 region:rollup2
IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO USE THOSE

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:01.979 region:rollup2
KINDS OF CREDITS TO FUND PUBLIC.

00:57:58.542 --> 00:58:02.412 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE THE IDEA ON

00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:04.481 region:rollup2
BEHIND THOSE KINDS.

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:06.083 region:rollup2
.

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:07.951 region:rollup2
TAKE MORE QUESTIONS OUT ANY

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND BEFORE

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:11.755 region:rollup2
I STOP THOUGH I DO WANT TO.

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
TALK BRIEFLY BRIEFLY BRIEFLY.

00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:14.057 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:16.259 region:rollup2
PROVISION.

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
POPPED UP THE

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:20.097 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT USED MAKES LIVE TO.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:22.099 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS I'M ONE IS THAT.

00:58:20.097 --> 00:58:23.400 region:rollup2
THE.

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:25.669 region:rollup2
THE SHIP TO A TERRITORIAL TAX

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:28.405 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AT THE ADVENT OF I'M SOME

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:28.939 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY NEW KINDS OF TAXES IS

00:58:28.405 --> 00:58:30.474 region:rollup2
GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF

00:58:28.939 --> 00:58:32.509 region:rollup2
THOUGHT. HOW THAT INTERACTS WITH

00:58:30.474 --> 00:58:33.777 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA?

00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:35.645 region:rollup2
AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE I'M

00:58:33.777 --> 00:58:36.513 region:rollup2
SETTLED NECESSARILY IMMEDIATELY

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:38.148 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE THOUGHT

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.950 region:rollup2
ABOUT VERY CAREFULLY.

00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:42.285 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:43.987 region:rollup2
IT'S IT IT IT.

00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:44.955 region:rollup2
WELL HONESTLY WITH THAT WE CAN.

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:48.358 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING IS MORE

00:58:44.955 --> 00:58:50.227 region:rollup2
PRESSING SO INSOFAR AS.

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:52.062 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE FROM A WORLDWIDE

00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:53.597 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF TAXATION TO A

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:54.831 region:rollup2
TERRITORIAL SYSTEM MEANS THAT

00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:56.600 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HIS

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:57.934 region:rollup2
DEMAND THAT TWO POINT SIX

00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.137 region:rollup2
TRILLION HOWEVER MUCH THAT'S

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:01.471 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING. TO BE REPATRIATED

00:59:00.137 --> 00:59:03.006 region:rollup2
AND REPATRIATED AS OF DECEMBER

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:04.875 region:rollup2
OF LAST YEAR.

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:07.044 region:rollup2
AND THAT MONEY IS COMING HOME

00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:09.846 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION IS.

00:59:07.044 --> 00:59:12.349 region:rollup2
WILL THE STATE'S ON TAX THAT.

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:14.217 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA'S AND

00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:16.953 region:rollup2
WE HAD AGAINST HIM PER THE FTP

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:17.521 region:rollup2
IS PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS IS NOT

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:19.055 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAX THAT MONEY VERY

00:59:17.521 --> 00:59:20.490 region:rollup2
MUCH.

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:22.025 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON IS THAT

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.959 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAW WASN'T

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:24.928 region:rollup2
WRITTEN WITH THAT MADRE THIS IS

00:59:22.959 --> 00:59:25.996 region:rollup2
DID THAT JUST IT GOES NO FAULT

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:27.297 region:rollup2
HERE IS JUST THAT.

00:59:25.996 --> 00:59:28.865 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NEW SECTION NIGHT

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:30.267 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE OF THE INTERNAL

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:32.302 region:rollup2
REVENUE CODE THAT ACHIEVES THIS

00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:33.336 region:rollup2
TEAM REPATRIATION. CALIFORNIA'S

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:35.238 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW DOESN'T REALLY

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:37.474 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO DO YOU TO TO SECTION

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:39.576 region:rollup2
NINE SIXTY FIVE AND THIS IS NOT

00:59:37.474 --> 00:59:41.378 region:rollup2
REALLY. AYE AYE HE SAYS THE FTP

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:44.281 region:rollup2
SEASON A STATUTORY HOKE TOM TO

00:59:41.378 --> 00:59:46.016 region:rollup2
TAX ON THAT INCOME I THINK THAT.

00:59:44.281 --> 00:59:47.184 region:rollup2
THAT WITHOUT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE

00:59:46.016 --> 00:59:48.718 region:rollup2
ON THE AND THAT SHOULD BE

00:59:47.184 --> 00:59:50.420 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED AND ESPECIALLY TO THE

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:52.255 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT ONE BELIEVES IS AS I

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.023 region:rollup2
THINK. THAT A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:55.292 region:rollup2
THAT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION

00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:57.027 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WAS ACT WAS ACTUALLY

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:58.728 region:rollup2
EARNED IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS

00:59:57.027 --> 01:00:01.031 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY MOVED A BROUHAHA

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:02.432 region:rollup2
ABROAD AND SO. TO THE EXTENT OF

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:03.533 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY I'M TO

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.236 region:rollup2
TAX THAT REVENUE.

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:08.705 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:11.942 region:rollup2
IT WOULD NEED TO COME A CHANGED

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:13.477 region:rollup2
LOCKED.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:15.078 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER

TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
OF THE I THINK NEW YORK HE SAID

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:33.130 region:rollup2
IS DOING IT IN.

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:34.431 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS AND IS THAT SOMETHING

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.299 region:rollup2
THAT IN EACH SORT OF TALK ABOUT

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.833 region:rollup2
OF A FOUNDATION.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:39.202 region:rollup2
BOB. OF.

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:40.370 region:rollup2

THESE ARE PAYROLL TAXES ALREADY

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:42.806 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BUILD ON THAT IS

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:44.107 region:rollup2
THAT A ME THAT YOU A MATTER OF

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY OR

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.909 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF LAYING OUT OPTIONS

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.645 region:rollup2
BUT IS THAT SUMMIT YOU THINK WE

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:50.046 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:51.848 region:rollup2
IT WE DO HAVE A SPOT BILL IN

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:53.483 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:54.851 region:rollup2
WHAT NEW YORK IS DOING WE WERE

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:55.719 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF WANTED TO TAKE A

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.354 region:rollup2
LOOK AND SEE WHAT NEW YORK'S

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:59.456 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE AND BECAUSE THEY DO

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:01.958 region:rollup2
HAVE SUCH A ROBUST AND. GROUP

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:03.894 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHAT THAT IS GOING TO

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:05.595 region:rollup2
KEEP EVOLVING INTO SO WE HAVE

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:07.397 region:rollup2
SOMETHING IN PLACE TO.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:09.065 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE DROPPED LEGISLATION

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:10.500 region:rollup2

.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.967 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:18.401 region:rollup2
I MEAN GIVEN THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:20.337 region:rollup2

WE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:49.866 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING IT UP.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:51.301 region:rollup2
AND ALL AND WHILE I THINK THESE

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:53.036 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY THE ONLY THREE

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:55.639 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT I'VE HEARD.

01:02:53.036 --> 01:02:56.239 region:rollup2
SPINOUT AM.

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:59.075 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY

01:02:56.239 --> 01:03:01.311 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVE AND IF YOU IMPLEMENTED

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:02.612 region:rollup2
ALL THREE. YOU WOULD GET A

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:04.147 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:07.050 region:rollup2
PERCENT COVERAGE.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:08.518 region:rollup2
FOR AT LEAST FOR STATE INCOME

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:12.722 region:rollup2
TAXES

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:13.623 region:rollup2
BUT SO. EMPLOYEES ARE OUT WOULD.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.190 region:rollup2
CLAIM THE WOULD WOULD BENEFIT

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.293 region:rollup2
FROM THE PAYROLL TAX

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:18.194 region:rollup2
SHIFT.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.929 region:rollup2
FOLKS WITH PASSED THROUGH

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:22.399 region:rollup2
INCOME WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.500 region:rollup2
UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:25.368 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOLKS WITH OTHER SORTS

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.237 region:rollup2
OF AND CALM DIVIDEND INCOME

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:27.871 region:rollup2
CAPITAL GAINS AND COM WOULD BE

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.906 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:31.408 region:rollup2
.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:32.442 region:rollup2
PROFITS THE EFFECTS OF THE

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:34.911 region:rollup2
FEDERAL.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:35.478 region:rollup2
ROLLBACK BY USING SOMETHING

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:39.949 region:rollup2
LIKE THE CHARITABLE CREDIT.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:40.550 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:43.019 region:rollup2
GOOD JUST IN THAT IN THAT VEIN

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:44.788 region:rollup2
I.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:46.323 region:rollup2
CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR PEOPLE IN

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:47.724 region:rollup2
EACH CATEGORY WHETHER IT'S THE

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:49.225 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE DONATION OF THE PAYROLL

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:51.895 region:rollup2
TAX WHAT THAT PERSON LOOKED LIKE

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:53.730 region:rollup2
SO. HOW MUCH DOES THAT PERSON

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:55.799 region:rollup2
MAKE LIKE IT ANY VERY KIND OF

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.133 region:rollup2
VISUAL WAY CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:58.702 region:rollup2
PERSON FOR EACH FOR EACH

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:59.803 region:rollup2
CATEGORY WHAT THAT PERSON LOOKS

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:02.472 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT BENEFITS FROM EACH OF

01:03:59.803 --> 01:04:04.307 region:rollup2
THE OPTION?

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:05.408 region:rollup2
NOT JUST IN IT IT'S HARD I KNOW

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.976 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S REALLY WHAT HELPED THEY

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:09.079 region:rollup2
THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND WHO

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:10.847 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING ABOUT. PASSED OUT

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:12.315 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY WHETHER THEY FILE

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:14.551 region:rollup2
ITEMIZED ARE.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:16.720 region:rollup2
BUT SUIT TO THE PAYROLL TAX A

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.521 region:rollup2
APPROACH IS GOING TO BENEFIT.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.489 region:rollup2
I.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.890 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN THE BOTTOM NINETY

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:23.293 region:rollup2
PERCENT

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:24.194 region:rollup2
WHO ARE NOT ITEMIZING DEDUCTIONS

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.562 region:rollup2
IT'S I WHO CLAIMING THE STANDARD

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:28.198 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION.

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:30.133 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MATTER ALL THAT MUCH

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.034 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR MARRIED

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.602 region:rollup2
COUPLES MAKING LESS THAN TWENTY

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.770 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:35.872 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PAYING

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:37.006 region:rollup2
ANY FEDERAL TAX ANYWAY. BUT ONCE

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.541 region:rollup2
YOU GET ABOVE TWENTY FOUR

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:39.943 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS IT IT DOES

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.378 region:rollup2
START TO MATTER EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:43.213 region:rollup2
IN THE TEN PERCENT BRACKET WHILE

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.614 region:rollup2
YOU'D RATHER PAY NINETY CENTS ON

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.648 region:rollup2
THE DOLLAR FOR STATE LOCAL

GOVERNMENT SERVICES.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:50.453 region:rollup2
THEN A HUNDRED CENTS ON THE

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:52.555 region:rollup2
DOLLAR AND WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:55.258 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY ARM IS YOU STILL

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:56.626 region:rollup2
FILE A CALIFORNIA RETURN I AT

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:59.662 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:04:56.626 --> 01:05:00.597 region:rollup2
AND AND WE WOULD HAVE A NEW

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.699 region:rollup2
CATEGORY OF.

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:04.367 region:rollup2
WE COULD CALL IT WAGES PAID BY

GOLDEN STATE EMPLOYERS.

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:08.037 region:rollup2
YOU COULD BECOME A A A GOLDEN

STATE EMPLOYER A GOLDEN STATE

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:10.774 region:rollup2
EIGHT NEW YORK IS DOING THIS WE

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:12.242 region:rollup2
THEIR SOMETIMES CALLED EMPIRE

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:12.842 region:rollup2
WORKS EMPLOYERS AN IGNORANT BUT

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.878 region:rollup2
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.745 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FIREWORKS. AND AND NEW

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:19.115 region:rollup2
YORK ACTUALLY.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:22.118 region:rollup2
ALLOWS YOU TO ELECT INTO EMPIRE

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:22.419 region:rollup2
WORKS EMPLOYER STATUS IT DOESN'T

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:22.552 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.920 region:rollup2
.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.687 region:rollup2
.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.289 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:28.358 region:rollup2
MANDATORY AS LONG AS THERE'S AN

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:29.526 region:rollup2
IRREVOCABLE ELECTION SO ANY

01:05:28.358 --> 01:05:31.394 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER THAT JUST DOESN'T

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:32.929 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS MIGHT. I MIGHT

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:34.430 region:rollup2
OPT OUT BUT.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.899 region:rollup2
APPLE GOOGLE FACEBOOK ARE

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.100 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO ONE OFTEN

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:39.436 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.303 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHO ARE HURT BY THIS

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.805 region:rollup2
ALL DEDUCTION IN THIS OR THE

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:43.807 region:rollup2
ROLL BACK IN THIS OP PRODUCTION

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:45.608 region:rollup2
AND THIS DIMINISHES OUR ABILITY

01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:46.943 region:rollup2
TO COMPETE FOR. TALENT

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.510 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE YOU OUT A NEW

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.311 region:rollup2
LINE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:51.414 region:rollup2
TAX.

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:53.483 region:rollup2
RETURN THAT WOULD SAY WAGES

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:54.818 region:rollup2
PAID BY AT WE JUST PAID BY

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:56.452 region:rollup2
GOLDEN STATE EMPLOYER.

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:58.855 region:rollup2
AND AND YOU WOULD THAT THERE'D

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:59.989 region:rollup2
BE A PROGRESSIVE CREDIT FORMULA.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:02.192 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:03.860 region:rollup2
HARD TO DO BY HAND BUT NOT BACK

01:06:02.192 --> 01:06:04.961 region:rollup2
HARD TO DO BY HAND AND I ASSUME

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.364 region:rollup2
USING TURBO TAX OR SOME SORT OF

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:10.266 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE ACCOUNTANTS.

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:11.601 region:rollup2
BUT ANYWAY TERMS OF. COMPARING

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:12.502 region:rollup2
THIS TO THE OTHER CALCULATIONS

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:14.070 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE ON YOUR

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.072 region:rollup2
TAX RETURNS

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:17.941 region:rollup2
CHILD CREDIT PHASE OUT BY

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:19.542 region:rollup2
ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS THE THIS IS

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:21.110 region:rollup2
THIS IS PRETTY EASY.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:23.279 region:rollup2
AND ANY WOULD OFFSET YOUR TAX

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.914 region:rollup2
LIABILITY BY THAT. IF YOUR IT IN

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:26.349 region:rollup2
A LOWER MID BRACKET IN

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:27.484 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOULD MEAN THAT AN

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.284 region:rollup2
YOU ONLY HAVE WHICH INCOME THAT

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.853 region:rollup2
WOULD MEAN THAT YOU OWE NOTHING

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:32.222 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE AND HERE. SO PEOPLE

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:34.557 region:rollup2
WHO ARE EARNING WILL HIGH FIVE

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:35.925 region:rollup2
DIGIT SALARIES LOW SIX DIGIT

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:38.361 region:rollup2
SALARIES WOULD STILL PROBABLY

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:38.995 region:rollup2
PAY NOTHING TO THE ITS STATE AT

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.696 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE YEAR SOME OF THEM

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.130 region:rollup2
I GET A REFUND.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:43.933 region:rollup2
YOU COULD MAKE IT A REFUNDABLE.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:46.569 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:48.571 region:rollup2
AND THEN I FOLKS AT THE HIGH END

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:50.440 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY STILL HAVE SOME

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:52.909 region:rollup2
INCOME THAT BECAUSE OF THE RATE

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.444 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SET FOR THIS NEW ALBUM

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:56.346 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAX

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:57.647 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE. AYE IF YOU'RE PLAYING

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.349 region:rollup2
FOR THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN

01:06:57.647 --> 01:07:00.783 region:rollup2
MAKING MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.484 region:rollup2
A YEAR YOU WIND UP GETTING THAT

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.418 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.920 region:rollup2
RATE OR PINE NOT GONNA HAVE A

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:05.288 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.823 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAX WILL PICK A LOWER

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.924 region:rollup2
NUMBER THAT'S. CLOSER TO THE

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.092 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE RATE STATEWIDE FIVE OR

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:10.326 region:rollup2
SIX

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:12.729 region:rollup2
SO THEN YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:15.131 region:rollup2
OTHER OPTIONS IN ORDER TO.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:17.166 region:rollup2
OFFSET THAT LAST BIT OF BY

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.667 region:rollup2
STATE TAX LIABILITY SO THAT'S

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.168 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'D LIKE TO THE

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.069 region:rollup2
CHARITABLE CREDIT THE FOLKS WILL

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.905 region:rollup2
BENEFIT FROM THE CHARITABLE

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:23.106 region:rollup2
CREDIT ARE GOING TO BE THE TOP

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:24.374 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT WHO ARE ITEMIZED

01:07:23.106 --> 01:07:26.009 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.745 region:rollup2
ITEMIZING DEDUCTIONS BENDIS

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:30.513 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DO YOU. BY ANYTHING UP

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:33.550 region:rollup2
FOR YOU I'M SAID THIS IS PEOPLE

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:34.083 region:rollup2
WITH SALARIES INTO FOR THE MOST

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.617 region:rollup2
PART DOLLARS INTO THE SIX

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.818 region:rollup2
FIGURES.

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:36.853 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON THE UNRELATED.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.021 region:rollup2
OR THE UNINCORPORATED BUSINESS

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.589 region:rollup2
TAX

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:40.757 region:rollup2
WHEN WE THINK OF PASS THROUGHS

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:42.725 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK OF THE COKE RATHER

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:44.460 region:rollup2
AS WE THINK OF THESE ASK COURTS

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:45.862 region:rollup2
WE THINK OF LAW FIRM PARTNERS.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.730 region:rollup2
I'M BUT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:50.900 region:rollup2
LOWER DOWN.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.801 region:rollup2
DE I'M INCOME LADDER AS WELL

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.705 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE SHOPKEEPER WHO'S

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:57.507 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED AS AN LLC BOMB IT IS

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:59.075 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE THE UBER DRIVER AYE

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:00.476 region:rollup2
AS WELL WHOSE TIME A SOLE

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.579 region:rollup2
PROPRIETOR. AND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:04.280 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO CONSULTS AS AN

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.949 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TO ANYONE

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.150 region:rollup2
WHO'S GETTING INCOME THAT'S NOT

01:08:05.949 --> 01:08:09.586 region:rollup2
ON A W. TO.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:11.754 region:rollup2
AND SETS UP AYE AS.

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:13.923 region:rollup2
SO PROPRIETORSHIP OR A

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:18.528 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP RATHER THAN A

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:20.063 region:rollup2
CORPORATION WOULD BENEFIT FROM.

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:21.898 region:rollup2
WELL I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:23.333 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO A DESIGN ELEMENT

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:24.968 region:rollup2
TO THIS RIGHT SO THE PAYROLL TAX

01:08:23.333 --> 01:08:26.035 region:rollup2
MEAN. IT COULD SAID IN A

01:08:24.968 --> 01:08:27.770 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS WHERE WE

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:29.339 region:rollup2
HAVE A CHOICE AS TO AS TO HOW WE

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.106 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO IT SO IT IT IS SO

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:32.175 region:rollup2
IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND THAT IT

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.710 region:rollup2
COULD. IT COULD HELP THE MOST

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:35.345 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:37.246 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TENSION BETWEEN HOW

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:38.681 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE IT REACHES ADDRESS

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:40.583 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE ARM.

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:41.918 region:rollup2
FEASIBILITY AND SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:43.486 region:rollup2
A POLITICAL QUESTION AS TO WHERE

01:08:41.918 --> 01:08:44.721 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO DRAW THE LINE.

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:46.389 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D NEW YORK'S IS

01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:46.990 region:rollup2
SETTING IN AT LEAST UNDER THE

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:47.991 region:rollup2
CURRENT DROPPED FORTY THOUSAND

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.359 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:50.860 region:rollup2
AND THE THOUGHT IS FOR FOLKS

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.729 region:rollup2
UNDER FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.430 region:rollup2
MOST THEIR INCOME IS SHELTERED

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:56.632 region:rollup2
FROM FEDERAL INCOME TAX BY THE

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:57.800 region:rollup2
STANDARD DEDUCTION AND BY CHILD

01:08:56.632 --> 01:09:00.903 region:rollup2
TAX CREDITS IN THE EARNED INCOME

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.739 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT. BY AND NEW YORK HAS.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:04.073 region:rollup2
STEEPLY GRADUATED RATE

01:09:02.739 --> 01:09:05.375 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES OF THEIR STATE.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:08.111 region:rollup2
STATE INCOME TAXES ARE

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.711 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL UP FOR THEM MAKING

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:08.978 region:rollup2
THEM CALCULATE DISCREDIT THEIR

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.713 region:rollup2
TAX RETURN

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:12.248 region:rollup2
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE.

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:13.549 region:rollup2
SAVING THEMSELVES

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:15.318 region:rollup2
BUT THEN OVER FORTY THOUSAND

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:16.552 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IT KICKS IN ARE UNDER

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:23.760 region:rollup2
NEW YORK'S APPROACH AT SOMETHING

01:09:16.552 --> 01:09:25.461 region:rollup2
LIKE A FIVE PERCENT RATE.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.462 region:rollup2
BUT TO QUESTIONS THAT. I THINK

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.663 region:rollup2
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:29.365 region:rollup2
OF IF WE WILL THAT ALL THREE

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
OPTIONS WE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:32.368 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A HUNDRED PERCENT

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:34.203 region:rollup2
RELIEF ON THE ON THE STATE. TAX

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:35.571 region:rollup2
SIDE IT IS THERE. BUT BUT YOU

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:37.206 region:rollup2
DID MENTION THIS SORT OF THE

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:39.776 region:rollup2
LOCAL TAX SIDE OF SALT.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:41.544 region:rollup2
IS THERE A ROLE FOR LOCALITIES

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.945 region:rollup2
TO PLAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.946 region:rollup2
RELIEF THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:46.049 region:rollup2
BE OR MAYBE THEY'RE DOING IT AND

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:47.183 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE HAS A WAY FOR US TO

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:49.552 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE LOCALITIES TO.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:50.987 region:rollup2
I'M PRIDE OPTIONS FOR

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:52.522 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS TO PAY THE LOCAL

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:53.656 region:rollup2
TAXES WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.858 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT THAT'S A QUESTION

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:57.627 region:rollup2
ONE AND THE QUESTION TWO IS IT.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:59.128 region:rollup2
IF IF WE REACT.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:01.597 region:rollup2
ARMED WITH SOME OF THESE OPTIONS

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:02.699 region:rollup2
AS OTHER STATES ARE.

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:04.367 region:rollup2
DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEN

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:05.568 region:rollup2
REACTED ARE REACTION AND THEN WE

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.336 region:rollup2
JUST SORT OF ARE IN THIS AND THE

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:09.639 region:rollup2
CYCLE OF TRYING TO GET BACK TO

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:11.307 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL. INTENT.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:12.708 region:rollup2
THEM LIKE THAT REQUIRES YOU TO

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.342 region:rollup2
HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL AND

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.277 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING BUT BUT I'M JUST SORT

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:16.079 region:rollup2
OF.

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:18.681 region:rollup2
WONDERING IT MEANS THEY CAN JUST

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:19.582 region:rollup2
ACT AGAIN STATUTORILY RIGHT AND

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.483 region:rollup2
AND CLOSE SOME OF THESE

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:22.051 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLES HOODIES DESIGNED

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:24.153 region:rollup2
AROUND SUCH THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:25.488 region:rollup2
CRAZY BLUE STATES WORKING ON

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.923 region:rollup2
LIKE NEW YORK IN CALIFORNIA.

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:27.123 region:rollup2
YEAH WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ONE

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:28.558 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.859 region:rollup2
.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:31.427 region:rollup2
IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MIGHT BE

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.762 region:rollup2
ABLE THE.

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:34.097 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS I MEAN

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:35.598 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE MUCH LESS FLEXIBILITY

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:37.433 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:37.600 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THAT THE SALES TAX IN

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.203 region:rollup2
THE.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.904 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX AND.

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:43.272 region:rollup2
THEY'LL HAVE NO FEES AND OTHER

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.340 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AS

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:46.075 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.343 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OPTIONS IS A STATE

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.711 region:rollup2
DOES BUT WE'VE SEEN. PEOPLE IN

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:50.179 region:rollup2
THE REQUESTED BROUGHT IT BACK TO

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:52.181 region:rollup2
YOU ON THAT. AND.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:53.015 region:rollup2
.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.950 region:rollup2
YEAH HE IS ALWAYS THE

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.818 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY THE FEDERAL

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:58.521 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT

01:10:55.818 --> 01:11:00.389 region:rollup2
THIS BUT.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:01.557 region:rollup2
YEAH THEY TENS THE WORKS.

01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:02.959 region:rollup2
TENDS TO WORK SLOWLY MOST THE

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.993 region:rollup2
TIME IT REALLY IT REALLY JUST

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:07.196 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY WANT TO GO

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:08.798 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:10.366 region:rollup2
TO ADD TWO POINTS FIRST ON ON

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.634 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU COULD DO FOR LOCAL

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:13.202 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:15.505 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:16.906 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:18.174 region:rollup2
I AM I MIGHT RUN INTO A STATE

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:19.175 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM WITH THIS

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:21.110 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:23.012 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK IT WORKS YOU CAN

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.914 region:rollup2
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT LOOKS A LOT

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:26.482 region:rollup2
LIKE THE AND.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:28.317 region:rollup2
THE CHARITABLE CREDIT IDEA.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:30.219 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CREATE SOMETHING

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:31.988 region:rollup2
CALLED GOLDEN STATE POINTS

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.823 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S GAGA ABOUT BUT COIN

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:36.125 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE GOLDEN STATE POINTS

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:37.627 region:rollup2
AND A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CITY

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:40.496 region:rollup2
BUYS A GOLDEN STATE POINT?

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:40.630 region:rollup2
UP FROM THE STATE.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:43.399 region:rollup2
.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:48.137 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS.

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:50.406 region:rollup2
I AND I'M A DONOR THEN GIVES A

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:52.275 region:rollup2
DOLLAR TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:53.776 region:rollup2
I AND GETS A GOLDEN STATE GOING

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:56.145 region:rollup2
BACK.

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:57.680 region:rollup2
THAT'S WORTH EIGHTY FIVE CENTS.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:12:00.316 region:rollup2
I THAT THEY CAN THEN USE TO

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.783 region:rollup2
OFFSET THEIR STATE TAX LIABILITY

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
THEIR STATE INCOME TAX

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.820 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

BY EIGHTY FIVE SECONDS.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:09.258 region:rollup2
I AND THE DONORS BETTER OFF.

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:10.827 region:rollup2

I AM I DEDUCTION THAT THEY

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.567 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T BE GETTING

01:12:16.232 --> 01:12:19.402 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THEM

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:21.537 region:rollup2
WELL OVER A DOLLAR. AND THE

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:23.906 region:rollup2
LOCALITIES BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:25.608 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY BY FROM THE STATE

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:27.243 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTY FIVE CENTS

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:27.777 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IT WAS WORTH A

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:28.878 region:rollup2
DOLLAR TO THEM THEY GOT A

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.980 region:rollup2
DOLLAR.

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:32.682 region:rollup2
FROM THE DONOR NEEDED STRUCTURE

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.083 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE CHARITABLE CREDIT

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:36.018 region:rollup2
THAT WHY I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:39.388 region:rollup2
AN ATTRACTIVE WAY ON TO DO IT

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:40.790 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY BECAUSE. IT TAPS INTO.

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:42.992 region:rollup2
THAT THE CRYPTO CRAZE.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:44.694 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IT MAKES THE FLOW OF

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:47.430 region:rollup2
FUNDS NOT GO THROUGH THE GENERAL

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:50.199 region:rollup2
FUND IT GOES DIRECTLY FROM THE

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:51.968 region:rollup2
DONOR TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:56.405 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THE THE

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:57.873 region:rollup2
ATTRACTION OF THAT I IS I THAT.

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:59.008 region:rollup2
THE IRS COULD CONCEIVABLY

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.576 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SAY THE

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:02.311 region:rollup2
ARIZONA PROGRAM AND CALIFORNIA

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:03.579 region:rollup2
BY SAYING WELL IN ARIZONA

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:05.181 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PAYING THE SCHOOL

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:06.916 region:rollup2
TUITION ORGANIZATION THEY'RE NOT

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.084 region:rollup2
PAYING THE STATE IF THE MONEY'S

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:10.386 region:rollup2
GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND IT

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:12.722 region:rollup2
LOOKS MORE LIKE. A PAYMENT IN

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:13.923 region:rollup2
LIEU OF STATE TAXES ON BUT IF

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.724 region:rollup2
YOU DO THIS APPROACH YOUR

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:17.627 region:rollup2
BENEFITING.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:19.395 region:rollup2
LOCALITIES AND I THINK PUTTING

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.997 region:rollup2
YOURSELF ON FIRMER GROUND.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.198 region:rollup2
FOR FEDERAL LAW PURPOSES

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:25.201 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE DOLLARS GOING

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:27.770 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY FROM THE THE DONOR.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:28.804 region:rollup2
TO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.839 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S REAL ECONOMIC

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.140 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.441 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN CENTS BETTER OFF RIGHT

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.143 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST LEAVING EVERYONE

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:36.879 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME POSITION AS BEFORE.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.947 region:rollup2
ON THE SECOND POINT BOMB COULD I

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:39.815 region:rollup2
COULD THIS ALL GO AWAY WILL

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:42.418 region:rollup2
LIKELY IT COULD ALL GO WAYS IF

01:13:39.815 --> 01:13:44.954 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY TWENTY AND CONTROL OF.

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:46.055 region:rollup2
THE. TWO POLITICAL BRANCHES

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:48.224 region:rollup2
SHIPS AND WE.

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:50.860 region:rollup2
ROLL BACK THAT I TWENTY

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:52.361 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN TAX LAW THEN. YOU'RE

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.263 region:rollup2
NO LONGER DEALING WITH A TEN

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:56.465 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP THOUGH ON

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:58.334 region:rollup2
THE PAYROLL TAX SIDE. BUT YOU

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:59.802 region:rollup2
WOULD STILL BE BENEFITING THE

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:02.505 region:rollup2
TWO THIRDS OF YOUR POPULATION

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:04.340 region:rollup2
THAT UP TILL NOW WASN'T ABLE TO

01:14:02.505 --> 01:14:07.877 region:rollup2
PAY WITH FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.211 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BOND FOR THE SECOND. YOU

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:12.715 region:rollup2
COULD IMAGINE.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:15.518 region:rollup2
A STATUTE I THINK ALL THREE OF

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:16.352 region:rollup2
US COULD WRITE A STATUTE THAT

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:16.752 region:rollup2
TARGETED THESE

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:17.119 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD BE

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.421 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.322 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD TIGHTEN MAKE OUR

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:19.956 region:rollup2
EFFORTS ALL FOR NAUGHT.

01:14:19.322 --> 01:14:20.589 region:rollup2
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STATUTE YOU

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:20.790 region:rollup2
CAN'T COUNTY TO EIGHTEEN IN THE

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.992 region:rollup2
HOUSE

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:24.794 region:rollup2
ON THAT BCAUSE IF THERE IS A

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:26.195 region:rollup2
STATUTE THAT IS DESIGNED TO TAKE

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:28.130 region:rollup2
AWAY TAX BUT.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:30.333 region:rollup2
FROM PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:32.234 region:rollup2
NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:33.569 region:rollup2
AND YOU TAKE AWAY THE CALIFORNIA

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:35.805 region:rollup2
AND NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:37.673 region:rollup2
REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:40.076 region:rollup2
TAX LAW. THEN IT'S GOING TO BE

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:42.044 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD FOR.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:48.884 region:rollup2
FOR THE HOUSE TO ASSEMBLE A

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:50.653 region:rollup2
SIMPLE MAJORITY ON THE.

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:52.321 region:rollup2
I AM CURIOUS IN ARIZONA ABOUT

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:54.490 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH DOES THE TERRIBLE FUND

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:55.624 region:rollup2
RAISE A YEAR.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.493 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH SMALLER.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.060 region:rollup2
THEN THEN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.694 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTION I THINK

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.429 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:01.931 region:rollup2
CAPTAIN

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:02.498 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:04.600 region:rollup2
DOLLARS NUMBER CONTRIBUTION

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:07.336 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.437 region:rollup2
OF THESE SO IT'S CAPS YEAH STILL

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.439 region:rollup2
IN YOUR PROJECTIONS HOW MUCH.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:11.941 region:rollup2
HAVE USED TO OR HOW MUCH ARE YOU

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:13.709 region:rollup2
PROJECTING THAT OUR CHARITABLE

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:14.577 region:rollup2
FUND WOULD MAKE A YEAR I MEAN

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:16.612 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE UNIVERSE THAT IT

01:15:14.577 --> 01:15:18.214 region:rollup2
BENEFITS.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:19.882 region:rollup2
WELL I I CERTAINLY.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:22.985 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WE'RE NOT ECONOMIST I'M

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.352 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN I'M ON SUCH HOT AND

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:24.153 region:rollup2
I'M IN A PRETTY.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.121 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.922 region:rollup2
THE FTV REPORT PROJECTED THAT HE

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:28.924 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:29.959 region:rollup2
THE. ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WHICH

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:31.327 region:rollup2
SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT TO IS AT THE

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.561 region:rollup2
OUTFLOW OF LOSING THE SALT

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:34.130 region:rollup2
ADOPTION IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:35.965 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY BILLION

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.500 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE PAST

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:40.102 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT. OF.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:42.171 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEDUCTIONS LOST.

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:43.572 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE CHARITABLE.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:45.541 region:rollup2
CREDIT PLAN WOULD BRING ALL THAT

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:46.909 region:rollup2
BACK I MEAN I I DON'T THINK YOU

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.911 region:rollup2
KNOW AS DANIEL EXPLAINED IT

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:50.246 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THAT BY DESIGN BUT IT

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.647 region:rollup2
COULD BE A GIVE IT COULD BE ON

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:53.883 region:rollup2
THE ORDER OF SEVERAL BILLION

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:55.217 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR SURE. WEEKS WHEN YOU

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:56.552 region:rollup2
SAY THERE'S FIFTEEN SEE SAID

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:58.220 region:rollup2
THERE'S FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.055 region:rollup2
MILLION LOSS BILLION BILLION

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.123 region:rollup2
LOST.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.558 region:rollup2
INDEED ACTIONS THAT IS ACROSS

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:04.360 region:rollup2
THE BORDER AND THAT IS JUST THE

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.294 region:rollup2
UNIVERSE THAT WE ARE THINKING

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.363 region:rollup2
WOULD USE THAT CHARITABLE

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:09.198 region:rollup2
DONATION. THAT ISSUED WHAT THE

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:12.034 region:rollup2
F. TO BE CALCULATED FOR TWENTY

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:13.702 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN FOR THE TOTAL TAXPAYERS.

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:15.104 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THEY LOST IN THAT THEY

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.638 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE LOST IN THEIR

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.038 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION IS WITH THE TEN

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:19.642 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS?

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:22.845 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:24.847 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON THE REPATRIATION TAX

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:25.648 region:rollup2
THAT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.216 region:rollup2
THERE WERE NOT TAX AND.

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:28.884 region:rollup2
.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.920 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND WAIT WHAT DO YOU WHAT

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:33.088 region:rollup2
IT KIND OF AYE? SUGGESTIONS TO

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.957 region:rollup2
HAVE ON THAT SORT OF ON TAXING

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:37.159 region:rollup2
THAT. REPATRIATION MONEY FOR

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.760 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:40.096 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE LOSS FOR

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.664 region:rollup2
US.

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.965 region:rollup2
YES WELL I WOULD.

01:16:41.664 --> 01:16:44.300 region:rollup2
PROPOSE.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:46.068 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:48.504 region:rollup2
TINKERING WITH.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:50.039 region:rollup2
CURRENT CORPORATE INCOME TAX ITS

01:16:48.504 --> 01:16:50.606 region:rollup2
FEET ITS IT THAT JUST HAVE A

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:55.044 region:rollup2
SORT OF A STANDALONE HAVE A

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:58.180 region:rollup2
STANDALONE PROVISION

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:59.281 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS. THAT THIS TEAM TO

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.050 region:rollup2
REAP SOME PORTION OF THE STEAM

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.118 region:rollup2
REPATRIATION WAS OUT IN

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.986 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:06.655 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO APPLY A REASONABLE

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:08.524 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT FORMULA IN ORDER

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:09.959 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT THAT WHEN NOT. DOUBLE

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:10.926 region:rollup2
TAXING IT RELATIVE TO FOREIGN

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.194 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND RELATIVE TO

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:14.330 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:16.532 region:rollup2
AND THOSE FORMULAS ARE.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.666 region:rollup2
.

01:17:16.532 --> 01:17:21.837 region:rollup2
EVALUATED BY COURTS

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:22.972 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIALLY.

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.440 region:rollup2
AS FOR BEING REASONABLE TOWARDS

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK A REASONABLE

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.309 region:rollup2
FORMULA MIGHT BE.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:28.244 region:rollup2
HERE'S ONE IDEA IF YOU COULD

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:31.881 region:rollup2
SAY WELL IT'S TWO POINT SIX

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:32.681 region:rollup2
TRILLION DOLLARS EARNED OVER.

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.416 region:rollup2
THE OF DECADES.

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.050 region:rollup2
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.818 region:rollup2
SOME PORTION OF IT WAS EARNED IN

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.453 region:rollup2
THE U. S.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:39.288 region:rollup2
LET'S SAY.

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:39.788 region:rollup2
BY PEOPLE DO A BY U. S. GDP

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:41.090 region:rollup2
SO TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:42.725 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:45.127 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:47.530 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF THAT AMOUNT THAT WAS

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
EARLY IN THE U. S.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.166 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN AMOUNT WAS OWNED IN

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:51.634 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CAN WILL DO A ROUGH

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.536 region:rollup2
CUT WILL SAY. NO TEN TWELVE

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:55.237 region:rollup2
PERCENT BY CALIFORNIA GDP RIGHT

01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:57.940 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU DO THAT THOSE NUMBERS

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:58.440 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S NO IT'S STILL A LARGE

01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.841 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME OF MONEY.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.176 region:rollup2
.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
WITH AND BE.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
A PORTION OF ALL TO CALIFORNIA

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.346 region:rollup2
AND THEN CALIFORNIA COULD THEN

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:05.181 region:rollup2
APPLY EITHER ITS REGULAR IT

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:07.016 region:rollup2
CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
EIGHT POINT EIGHT FOUR PERCENT.

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.885 region:rollup2
OR THEORETICALLY COULD SAY WILL

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.020 region:rollup2
KEY WILL DO A POINT A FOUR

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:13.122 region:rollup2
PERCENT PLUS.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.657 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT PENALTY BECAUSE

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.824 region:rollup2
REALLY YOU SHOULD OF LUCID GOT

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:17.993 region:rollup2
MISS MONEY YEARS AGO SO ATTRACT

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:20.129 region:rollup2
INTEREST NOW. ANY ADDITIONAL

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:20.262 region:rollup2
RATE OVER THE REGULAR RATE.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:20.829 region:rollup2
.

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:22.498 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:24.133 region:rollup2
I'M EACH

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:25.067 region:rollup2
BE AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE THAT

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
THE BUT THE RULE IS YOU CAN'T

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.870 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST FOREIGN

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:29.805 region:rollup2
INCOME AND SO YOU'D OR ANY UP

01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:31.207 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:34.209 region:rollup2
WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS INCOME

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:34.743 region:rollup2
WAS EARNED ABROAD DAN HAPPY TO

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:35.377 region:rollup2
HIRE IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:36.979 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
ON THIS CONCEPTUAL STATION IT

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:39.348 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INCOME I'M EARNED

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.585 region:rollup2
DOMESTICALLY.

01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:44.086 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:45.521 region:rollup2
BASIC IDEA.

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:47.156 region:rollup2
HAVE A SEPARATE STATUTE

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:48.824 region:rollup2
SPECIAL APPORTIONMENT FORMULA

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:49.725 region:rollup2
YOU CAN APPLY AT LEAST YOUR

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:52.595 region:rollup2
REGULAR CORPORATE INCOME TAX

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:54.697 region:rollup2
RATE. HE PROBABLY ALSO SHOULD

01:18:52.595 --> 01:18:56.632 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME KIND OF PROVISION.

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:59.268 region:rollup2
I'M FOR PETITIONS FOR SPECIAL

01:18:56.632 --> 01:19:00.336 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES SO FOR INSTANCE.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:01.737 region:rollup2
UP CERTAIN CALIFORNIA

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:03.806 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS RIGHT NOW

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:04.373 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SAYS WE'RE GONNA TAX

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:06.675 region:rollup2
YOU ON ALL OF YOUR WORLDWIDE

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:08.344 region:rollup2
INCOME.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:09.712 region:rollup2
SO THERE COULD BE CORPORATIONS

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:11.513 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE THEORETICALLY PAY TAX

01:19:09.712 --> 01:19:12.748 region:rollup2
ON THIS INCOME ALREADY

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:13.382 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEY

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:13.582 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TAX ON IT TO

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.451 region:rollup2
GET.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:17.019 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:18.921 region:rollup2
WHY WHY PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT'S

01:19:17.019 --> 01:19:19.922 region:rollup2
NOT TRUE POST BECAUSE?

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:22.157 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TAKE A WATERSHED

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:23.325 region:rollup2
ELECTION WHICH IS TO SAY THAT IF

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:24.827 region:rollup2
YOU'RE A MULTINATIONAL

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:27.229 region:rollup2
CORPORATION EARNS LOTS OF MONEY

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:29.164 region:rollup2
ABROAD YOU CAN CHOOSE TO ONLY BE

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:31.133 region:rollup2
TAXED ON YOU YOU S. AND.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:32.167 region:rollup2
SO I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.903 region:rollup2
FAKE ONLINE CORPORATIONS THAT

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:36.372 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL THIS MONEY ABROAD TOOK

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:38.774 region:rollup2
THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTIONS.

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:39.908 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE DID NOT PAY TAX.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.077 region:rollup2
ON THAT IT UP BUT IT'S

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:43.479 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY HAS TO BE A PROVISION

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:45.547 region:rollup2
FOR THAT ARE IN THE LAW.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:49.151 region:rollup2
I'M COMMITTEE I'M SOME KIND OF

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:51.153 region:rollup2
OF. PROCEDURE I'M IN CASE THE

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:52.488 region:rollup2
INCOMES BUT TAXED ALREADY.

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:53.389 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO FURTHER

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.923 region:rollup2
DETAIL BUT THAT'S THE.

01:19:53.389 --> 01:20:11.073 region:rollup2
JUST ABOUT.

01:19:54.923 --> 01:20:11.073 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.850 region:rollup2
.

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:23.118 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK OF HOW UNHAPPY TO

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.520 region:rollup2
A.

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:25.788 region:rollup2
IT CAN THE IRISH AT THE SOUND BY

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.655 region:rollup2
RIGHT I REGULATION.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:29.358 region:rollup2
.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:31.493 region:rollup2
IT I THINK IT VARIES FROM.

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:33.429 region:rollup2
FROM PLAN TO PLAN.

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:36.732 region:rollup2
.

01:20:33.429 --> 01:20:38.934 region:rollup2
ON THE ON THE PAYROLL TAX.

01:20:36.732 --> 01:20:41.704 region:rollup2
THE IDEA THAT.

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:43.872 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER PAID PAYROLL TAXES ARE

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:45.574 region:rollup2
NOT INCLUDED IN EMPLOYEE GROSS

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:47.276 region:rollup2
INCOME.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:48.277 region:rollup2
GOES WAY BACK RIGHT

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:49.945 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT GOES BACK TO NINETEEN

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:52.781 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE.

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:54.216 region:rollup2
WERE AND.

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:56.485 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY A HUNDRED DOLLARS I

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:57.386 region:rollup2
EARNED SIX DOLLARS TWENTY CENTS

01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:59.054 region:rollup2
IS PAID BY MY EMPLOYER.

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:03.192 region:rollup2
IN.

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:04.560 region:rollup2
OASDI IN SOCIAL SECURITY AYE NO

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.228 region:rollup2
ONE THINKS THAT I SHOULD REALLY

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.129 region:rollup2
BE TAXED ON A HUNDRED AND SIX

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:09.531 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND.

01:21:07.129 --> 01:21:10.432 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:14.336 region:rollup2
AND AND WE HAVE.

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:15.604 region:rollup2
THE YEARS OF EMPLOYER SIDE

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.705 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAXES FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.807 region:rollup2
INSURANCE

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:21.543 region:rollup2
DC HAS DONE THIS FOR.

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:24.380 region:rollup2
FOR PAY WE PAID LEAVE AT NEW

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:27.082 region:rollup2
YORK'S DOES THIS TO FIND I'M.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:29.551 region:rollup2
ITS MTI ADDS A AYE METRO TRANSIT

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:31.887 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY AND AND.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:32.921 region:rollup2
UNSETTLING THAT WOULD BE A I

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.090 region:rollup2
THINK DIFFICULT.

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:36.024 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD. BE DOING IT BY

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.659 region:rollup2
REGULATION WOULD.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:39.862 region:rollup2
.

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:41.997 region:rollup2
RAISE A LOT OF RISK FOR.

01:21:39.862 --> 01:21:42.564 region:rollup2
FOR THE IRS AND COULD THEY DO

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:44.066 region:rollup2
IT YEAH I GUESS THEY COULD

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:45.134 region:rollup2
PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND THEN

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.667 region:rollup2
WAIT FOR IT TO BE CHALLENGE IN

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:46.902 region:rollup2
COURT BUT THIS WOULD MOST

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.404 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY BE.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.772 region:rollup2
AND THE CHALLENGE IN COURT AND I

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.006 region:rollup2
WOULD BET ON THE TAXPAYERS.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:53.242 region:rollup2
ON THE CHARITABLE CREDITS.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:55.010 region:rollup2
IT IS.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:56.578 region:rollup2
I THINK SO STUDENT WHATWERE

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:59.181 region:rollup2
LARGELY GOING ON HERE'S A CHIEF

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.850 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT WAS

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:02.084 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE MISSOURI I CREDIT

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:02.551 region:rollup2
SCHEME.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.620 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:06.355 region:rollup2
WHICH

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.055 region:rollup2
I I CHIEF COUNSEL ADVICE

PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TAXPAYERS

LOOK TO IT LOOK TO THESE ALL THE

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:12.194 region:rollup2
TIME BUT THE IRS COULD BY

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.430 region:rollup2
REGULATION.

01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:16.431 region:rollup2
GO BACK ON.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:19.968 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE ARE.

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:20.836 region:rollup2
CHIU DOWNSIDES OF THAT FROM

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:22.004 region:rollup2
THIRD CHIU.

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:22.571 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ICEBERGS OF THE IRIS

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:24.373 region:rollup2
IT.

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:26.909 region:rollup2
ONE.

THE CROSS HAIRS ALL WHOLE BUNCH

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:33.015 region:rollup2
OF RED STATE PROGRAMS.

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:35.117 region:rollup2
THAT ARE VERY POLITICALLY

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:38.086 region:rollup2
POPULAR AMONG.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:40.389 region:rollup2
SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BASE

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:41.990 region:rollup2
RIGHT AT THE THAT I ARIZONA

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:43.158 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS POPULAR LARGELY

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.193 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ITS FIRST AMENDMENT

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:45.194 region:rollup2
ARBITRAGE NOT TAX.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:47.863 region:rollup2
NOT

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:48.764 region:rollup2
WASN'T INITIALLY TAX MOTIVATED

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:50.599 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE REAL TAX BENEFITS

01:22:48.764 --> 01:22:51.800 region:rollup2
THAT MANY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:53.368 region:rollup2
ADVERTISEMENTS AT THE ARIZONA

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:56.672 region:rollup2

MAKE IT BAD TAXES A KEY

01:22:56.672 --> 01:22:59.241 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THIS

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:01.710 region:rollup2
SO ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:03.278 region:rollup2
FLOW OF FUNDS GO FROM DONOR TO

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:05.080 region:rollup2
AN ENTITY OTHER THAN THE GENERAL

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:06.448 region:rollup2
FUND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.417 region:rollup2
TO WRITE A REGULATION THAT KILLS

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:09.885 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT DOESN'T KILL A WHOLE

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:11.753 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF PROGRAMS THAT.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:13.789 region:rollup2
AB THE IRS CHIEF COUNSEL WOULD

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:15.490 region:rollup2
BE HAPPY TO HILL AYE KILL BUT

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:16.558 region:rollup2
WILL BE AYE GETTING SECRETARY OF

TREASURY BY AND.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:20.062 region:rollup2
AS HE NEEDS TO FOR AND.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.763 region:rollup2
REGULATION

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:23.532 region:rollup2
OUT WILL BE A LOT HARDER SECOND

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.801 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SUPREME COURT CASE

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:26.802 region:rollup2
RANDALL VERSUS LAS GOTTEN FROM I

01:23:25.801 --> 01:23:28.904 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:31.273 region:rollup2
THAT. IS ABOUT ACTUALLY A

01:23:28.904 --> 01:23:34.076 region:rollup2
SECURITIES LAW ISSUE.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:35.310 region:rollup2
I AND THERE IS A LINE IN IT. I.

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:36.378 region:rollup2
AND IT'S KIND OF A THROWAWAY

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.913 region:rollup2
LINE BUT IT'S IN A SUPREME COURT

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:39.548 region:rollup2
OPINION.

01:23:37.913 --> 01:23:40.082 region:rollup2
AND THAT SAYS

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:42.784 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT ASSUME THAT A

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:45.454 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:47.356 region:rollup2
AYE IS PART OF GROSS INCOME FOR

01:23:45.454 --> 01:23:49.124 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF SECTION SIXTY ONE OF

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:51.927 region:rollup2
THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE UNLESS

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:53.929 region:rollup2
CONGRESS HAS CLEARLY INDICATED

01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:56.598 region:rollup2
THAT IT OUGHT TO BE.

01:23:53.929 --> 01:23:58.033 region:rollup2
AND AND YEAH IT'S IN THE SUPREME

01:23:56.598 --> 01:24:00.669 region:rollup2
COURT COULD GO BACK ON THAT.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:02.571 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN'T BY REGULATION ON

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:04.139 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING THAT THE SUPREME

01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:04.773 region:rollup2
COURT HAS SAID AND YOU BET THAT

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:06.408 region:rollup2
IF THE IRS PROMULGATES

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:07.976 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:08.510 region:rollup2
BUT THAT ARE TRYING TO SHUT DOWN

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.946 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:12.147 region:rollup2
NASCENT TERRIBLE CREDIT SCHEMES

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:13.482 region:rollup2
ARE NOT SCHEMES CHARITABLE

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.616 region:rollup2
CREDIT. THAT.

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:16.952 region:rollup2
I USE THE WORD SCHEME IN A.

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:19.488 region:rollup2
.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:21.490 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANY PEJORATIVE SENSE.

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:23.559 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION PHYLLIS IT IF IT GOT

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:26.094 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION FACILITATION STRATEGY.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.495 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT THAT SUPREME COURT

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:28.230 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WILL BE.

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:30.032 region:rollup2
.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.999 region:rollup2
THROWN AROUND AND AND THERE'S

01:24:30.032 --> 01:24:32.901 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE OF JUSTICE

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:34.836 region:rollup2
KENNEDY'S OPINION IN THE ARIZONA

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:36.204 region:rollup2
SCHOOL TUITION AYE CASE BUT

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:37.039 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT WASN'T QUITE ON POINT

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:39.074 region:rollup2
IT WAS REALLY ABOUT THE FIRST

01:24:37.039 --> 01:24:41.209 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT. BUT SUPREME COURT

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.743 region:rollup2
DIPPED I CAN GET IN THE WAY OF

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:45.414 region:rollup2
THE TREASURY REGULATION.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:47.015 region:rollup2
AND.

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:48.617 region:rollup2
SO SO THE UPSHOT IS THAT THERE

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:50.619 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY IS ARRESTED.

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:53.355 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:54.856 region:rollup2
NEED TO FOCUS ON THE LEGISLATION

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:56.224 region:rollup2
THAT COMES OUT BEING A STRONG.

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:58.527 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:25:00.195 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:01.363 region:rollup2
GET THAT THERE IS A. A

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.965 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN.

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:05.901 region:rollup2
.

01:25:02.965 --> 01:25:07.569 region:rollup2
HOW STRONG WE MAKE THE?

01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:10.939 region:rollup2
BILL OR.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
AND HOW LIKELY IRIS ACTION IS

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:14.843 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:16.311 region:rollup2
ARE MAKE THE BILL HAVE.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:18.347 region:rollup2
FIELD BY DESIGN A LOT OF

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:20.582 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE RIGHT AS WE IMAGINING

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:22.618 region:rollup2
HOW I'M CERTAIN TAXPAYERS ARE

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:24.453 region:rollup2
FINANCING GOVERNMENT THE

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:28.323 region:rollup2
STRONGER OUR POSITION IS UMP

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:29.958 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE CHALLENGED.

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:32.194 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WILL ASK QUESTIONS SO

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:34.096 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS LONG TERM FEDERAL

01:25:32.194 --> 01:25:35.597 region:rollup2
LEVEL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:38.300 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT LEAST PROJECT WILL GO

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:39.901 region:rollup2
DOWN WHICH OF THESE WHEN I COME

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.170 region:rollup2
HOME SCHEMES WE KNOW WHICH OF

01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:43.739 region:rollup2
THESE IDEAS WHICH PAYROLL TAX

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:47.342 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION WHICH WHICH ONE

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:47.909 region:rollup2
WILL ACTUALLY. BE THAT HAVE THE

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:49.411 region:rollup2
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO OFFSET.

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:52.214 region:rollup2
THAT

01:25:49.411 --> 01:25:53.315 region:rollup2
BUT INVESTMENT GOING DOWN.

01:25:52.214 --> 01:26:03.225 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GENERATING REVENUE

01:25:53.315 --> 01:26:07.162 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE.

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:09.831 region:rollup2
.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:12.334 region:rollup2
I GUESS.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:13.402 region:rollup2
I WOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY THAT.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:17.172 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STRATEGIES ARE

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:19.107 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED TO DO IS O ENABLE?

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:20.742 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SNOOZE

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.910 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS TO

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:23.512 region:rollup2
THE SAME EXTENT AS IT'S BEEN

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:25.580 region:rollup2
SPENDING.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:27.082 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.550 region:rollup2
AND THAT DAY AS DANIEL EXPLAINED

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:30.385 region:rollup2
ARE ALL COMPLIMENTARY.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.987 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S UNCLEAR CLEAR

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:33.221 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WE DON'T KNOW THE

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:34.356 region:rollup2
UPTAKE OF THE CHARITABLE

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:35.991 region:rollup2
DEDUCTION THING WE DON'T KNOW

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.925 region:rollup2
HOW THE IRIS WILL APPROACH IT.

01:26:35.991 --> 01:26:38.560 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LIMIT

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:40.028 region:rollup2
WILL BE PUT THE PAYROLL TAX IT

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.263 region:rollup2
IF IT'S VOLUNTARY HOW WHAT THE

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.831 region:rollup2
UPTAKE WILL BE THERE SO THESE

01:26:41.263 --> 01:26:45.467 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THINGS WE DON'T KNOW BUT

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:46.601 region:rollup2
IT. THEN ASKED WE WILL END UP

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:48.136 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WERE TWO THOUSAND

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:51.273 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN RIGHT IN TERMS OF.

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:52.174 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF CALIFORNIA

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:53.875 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IS FUNDED WITH

01:26:52.174 --> 01:26:56.178 region:rollup2
FEDERALLY DEDUCTIBLE DOLLARS TO

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:57.112 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT SAY?

01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:58.747 region:rollup2
?

01:26:57.112 --> 01:27:00.782 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BIG TWENTY

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:02.884 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR HIT BECAUSE OF

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:04.052 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL OBAMACARE REPEAL ALL

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.454 region:rollup2
OF WHICH TO DO WHICH IS KIND AND

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.422 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TALKING LOGISTICS

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:08.056 region:rollup2
MONTHS AGO. AND NONE OF THESE

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:09.658 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.959 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES

01:27:09.658 --> 01:27:12.060 region:rollup2
WILL MITIGATE THAT.

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:15.530 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:16.965 region:rollup2
.

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.133 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT AT LEAST

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:19.801 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEM HAVE THE POTENTIAL

01:27:18.133 --> 01:27:20.836 region:rollup2
TO HELP MITIGATE

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:23.338 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THAT'S WHY I SIGNALED

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:26.141 region:rollup2
WHILE. HE OF THE PAYROLL TAX IS

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:28.210 region:rollup2
IMPOSED AND THE CREDIT IS NINETY

01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:31.046 region:rollup2
PERCENT. BIDAK COULD GENERATE

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:33.181 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT CREDITS TOWARDS A

01:27:31.046 --> 01:27:35.016 region:rollup2
MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF THEIR

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:36.618 region:rollup2
NAM OBAMACARE.

01:27:35.016 --> 01:27:39.454 region:rollup2
I'M FOR INSTANCE SO THAT TOOK

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:40.388 region:rollup2
THAT SO I DON'T THINK IT.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.157 region:rollup2
ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS WOULD

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:43.758 region:rollup2
GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE BUT

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:45.327 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT COULD SET THE

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:48.296 region:rollup2
SUPERSTRUCTURE.

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:50.532 region:rollup2
FORD FOR OTHER KINDS BECAUSE I

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:52.801 region:rollup2
I'LL SHIP YOU KNOW.

01:27:50.532 --> 01:27:53.635 region:rollup2
JUST RETURN TO SOMETHING THAT

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:55.971 region:rollup2
DAVID IS HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:57.439 region:rollup2
CREATURES THAT THE CALIFORNIA.

01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:58.540 region:rollup2
SPACE SICK TAX SYSTEM HASN'T

01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:58.807 region:rollup2
CHANGED SINCE THE NINETEEN

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.041 region:rollup2
THIRTIES.

01:27:58.807 --> 01:28:02.144 region:rollup2
.

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.744 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX

01:28:02.144 --> 01:28:02.978 region:rollup2
CORPORATE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:04.179 region:rollup2
OF THIS

01:28:02.978 --> 01:28:05.981 region:rollup2
TAX

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:07.682 region:rollup2
I'M EXCEPT FOR THE VARIOUS

01:28:05.981 --> 01:28:09.417 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAX LIMITATIONS ON

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:11.553 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.087 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:13.455 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE ART TWENTIETH

01:28:12.087 --> 01:28:14.055 region:rollup2
CENTURY.

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:15.624 region:rollup2
RIGHT MUCH LESS A TWENTY FIRST

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:17.859 region:rollup2
CENTURY.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:19.528 region:rollup2
SO IF THIS SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:20.762 region:rollup2
WERE TO SORT OF MOTIVATE US TO

01:28:19.528 --> 01:28:22.097 region:rollup2
THINK ALONG THOSE LINES THAT

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.431 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:28:22.097 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT MAKE LEMONADE.

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.868 region:rollup2
I

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.937 region:rollup2
CAN I JUMP IN ON ON THAT SO OF

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:31.006 region:rollup2
THE THREE IF IT'S WHICH WILL.

01:28:28.937 --> 01:28:31.940 region:rollup2
.

01:28:31.006 --> 01:28:32.641 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL DO THE MOST RAISE

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.209 region:rollup2
REVENUE FOR.

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.310 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN

01:28:34.209 --> 01:28:36.878 region:rollup2
VOTE ONE OFF THE ISLAND

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:38.947 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY THE UNINCORPORATED

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:39.781 region:rollup2
BUSINESS TAX IS A SMALLER PIECE

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:41.483 region:rollup2
OF THE PUZZLE BECAUSE MOST

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.551 region:rollup2
INCOME THERE'S MUCH MORE WAGE

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:44.152 region:rollup2
INCOME THAN THERE IS.

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:46.488 region:rollup2
PASS THROUGH INCOME IN

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:49.424 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:52.627 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE PAYROLL TAX

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:53.161 region:rollup2
DOES MORE TO FACILITATE PAYMENT

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.763 region:rollup2
OF.

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:56.665 region:rollup2
STATE TAXES WITH BUT WE

01:28:54.763 --> 01:28:58.200 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES OPTICS RIGHT BECAUSE

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:59.467 region:rollup2
IT AFFECTS A HUNDRED PERCENT OR

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.236 region:rollup2
IT AFFECTS ALL WORKERS RATHER

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:03.705 region:rollup2
THAN JUST THE TEN PERCENT. OF

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:05.407 region:rollup2
ITEMIZE YEARS AND AT LAST IT

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:06.942 region:rollup2
STILL HELPS THEM BEYOND TWENTY

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:07.842 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE EVEN IF EVERYTHING

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:09.711 region:rollup2
PHASES OUT.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:11.279 region:rollup2
I'M AND THEIR REASONS WHY WOULD

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:12.781 region:rollup2
WANT TO HELP PEOPLE BE ON TWENTY

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:14.316 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE EVEN IF EVERYTHING

01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:15.817 region:rollup2
FACES OUT BECAUSE THE ONE POINT

01:29:14.316 --> 01:29:17.018 region:rollup2
FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:17.752 region:rollup2
COME BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.887 region:rollup2
RIGHT THROUGH THE FEDERAL

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:20.288 region:rollup2
SPENDING CUTS HAVE TO HAPPEN

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:21.489 region:rollup2
SOMETIME I AND I DON'T THINK

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:22.390 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL. GOING TO HAPPEN

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:24.793 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:27.062 region:rollup2
FIVE IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE.

01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:27.629 region:rollup2
BEARING A LARGER.

01:29:27.062 --> 01:29:29.331 region:rollup2
BURDEN AS A RESULT

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:30.732 region:rollup2
IF IT'S ACTION IS IT SHOULD AND

01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:33.034 region:rollup2
THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE MORE

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:34.736 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO SUPPORT INCREASES IN

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:36.705 region:rollup2
STATE LEVEL TAXES BECAUSE THE

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.973 region:rollup2
AFTER TAX PRICE TO THEM IS LOWER

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:39.407 region:rollup2
THAN IT WOULD BE WITHOUT.

01:29:37.973 --> 01:29:40.876 region:rollup2
IF IT'S ABOUT DIRECTLY MAKING

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:42.177 region:rollup2
MONEY FOR OUR THE STATE GENERAL

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:44.346 region:rollup2
FUND BUT I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT

01:29:42.177 --> 01:29:47.482 region:rollup2
WITH A TERRIBLE CREDIT. I AND

01:29:44.346 --> 01:29:49.284 region:rollup2

REVENUE OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD

01:31:51.106 --> 01:31:54.509 region:rollup2
BE I MEAN IF YOU THINK OF ALL

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:55.777 region:rollup2
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.912 region:rollup2

INCLINATION FOR SOME COMPANIES

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:15.630 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO GET FOLKS

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:16.164 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER STATES FOR THE

PAYROLL TAX.

01:32:16.164 --> 01:32:19.501 region:rollup2
.

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:20.969 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE.

01:32:19.501 --> 01:32:21.970 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS ON

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:28.476 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZING BUSINESSES TO

01:32:21.970 --> 01:32:30.912 region:rollup2
UTILIZE IT.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:32.881 region:rollup2
I.

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:34.549 region:rollup2
SEE YOU COULD MAKE.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:36.785 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN CREDITS AVAILABLE TO

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:37.719 region:rollup2

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:46.661 region:rollup2
COULD ALLOW THEM TO CLAIM STATE

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.595 region:rollup2
ARE DE CREDITS IF THEY ARE BUT

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:49.364 region:rollup2
NOT IF THEY'RE.

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:51.433 region:rollup2
YOU COULD HAVE.

01:32:49.364 --> 01:32:52.767 region:rollup2
YOU COULD MODEST LEAVE REDUCE

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:54.536 region:rollup2
THEIR CORPORATE TAX RATE.

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:56.171 region:rollup2

ANGERS EMPLOYERS.

01:33:09.184 --> 01:33:12.587 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA I ASSUME THAT YOU

HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR THAT

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.990 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS SO.

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:17.725 region:rollup2
SO PROBABLY WHEN DO THAT BUT

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:19.994 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THE PROGRAM IS EVEN

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:21.696 region:rollup2
BETTER IF THERE ARE LEGAL

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.864 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES OTHER THAN THE

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:24.599 region:rollup2
PAYROLL TAX DIFFERENCE.

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:26.267 region:rollup2
BETWEEN GOLDEN STATE WORKS

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:28.069 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS AND OTHER EMPLOYERS A

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:29.704 region:rollup2
CAN BE FAVORABLE DIFFERENCES

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:30.939 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:33.141 region:rollup2

TO THIS THEN NOT ONLY DO YOU

01:33:48.690 --> 01:33:52.293 region:rollup2
GOT MORE BY AND.

01:33:50.258 --> 01:33:53.828 region:rollup2
IF THOSE DIFFERENCES ARE ARE

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.429 region:rollup2
POSITIVE DIFFERENCES REASONS WHY
