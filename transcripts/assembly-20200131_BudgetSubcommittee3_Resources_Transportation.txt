one that says push. Good evening everyone let me begin by- thanking god father John of the resurrection church for making this facility available. You are here to participate and what we call- lovingly in Sacramento budget subcommittee number three- but that's subcommittee as part of our important budget process. We oversee not just natural resources issues including the department of toxic substance can troll who you will be hearing from later- but also- oversee transportation agencies and- transportation issues who have a very broad jurisdiction in the subcommittee but- up. Today as so we were two years ago when we were here resurrection church we her to provide oversight regarding the exite clean up and as- chair of the subcommittee I want you to know that I have followed and worked on this issue for several years now- for those of you who are here for the second hearing I think you know that we've been- closely following. The clean up to make sure the proper oversight occurs. And to after several years the sub committee- has taken a number of actions to approve funding to clean up the contamination caused by excited there's been a total to this day of two hundred and fifty seven. Point six million dollars in general fund money that's been committed to the effort. The purpose of the hearing today is to get an update from the department to- on the status of the clean up. To ask how much of the allocated funds have been encumbered liquidated and finally to hear about the coordination- that is occurring between the department and the Los Angeles county office of public health. Before I offer my colleagues the opportunity to say a few words I want to take care of for a couple of housekeeping items- of everyone who is here who would like to- address us in at- public comment. Will have an opportunity to do so before we close out the hearing. Of we are going to circulate comment cards which are over to my left- and- if you're interested in making a public comment we ask that you write your name down those cars will be brought to me and I will call them. Probably in groups of three so that you can come forward and- know when you're speaking time will begin. There's also of physical copies of the agenda that- available and I think those are also over to my left- but today you can find the agenda online as well if you want to see it online. There is a- website to attach to the budget subcommittee and Susan I don't remember what the addresses for the budget subcommittee so. Okay anybody needs it ceases. So without for further do I want to pass- whether have to pass the microphone I will- I ask my colleagues would like to add some comments and welcome them at the same time so welcome to assembly member Cristina Garcia and- Miguel Santiago anything different over who's going to go first your available. Thank you I know it's Friday and adds the in the fight it in the long weeks I want to thank all the community members and folks who are here tonight and I've been here for many years working on this I also want to thank the chair of but is that the for being a good partner in this and staying on top of the work continues its being that in and the staff with the committee as well I think it's commendable- that our colleague has been committed to this issue. Of whether it's in this district or not it's in the state and so I do appreciate that continue to. Support I'm gonna I'm gonna be. Really short there are certain this here for you to get tested I hope you take advantage of the maybe have an already we know- that the process and then perfect and so just think you do the community who continue to advocate to help us learn to do a better and so I. Look forward to getting the update with you- and getting direction. As you continue to work. I do hope that we- are I do believe that. We've been learning and it's not perfect that and so I understand the frustration and the work that's ahead and so I don't want to minimize that. But I have seen some progress out there. And I am committed to continue to work with the residents in the activists and continue to take advice along the way. On and then to thank you to our supervisor for always being. A such a great partner and in the separate to making sure that it's not just a state but the county and other regional. Agencies are with us and so with that it's Friday homeless get on. Thank you. Thank you ms Garcia. Mister Santiago. Yeah thank you don't go the many thanks to- all our colleagues here here miss Garcia- Mister bloom and certainly our our very own. I'm supervisors to lease- and one thing the community really for and all the commuter organizations and all the different books Y. C. out their father Moreira. The resurrection community and- I started list and I'm we'd we'd be here for awhile because- this is been a long challenge and if you are is aggravated and upset. And is frustrated at not getting done quickly and fast. Believe me it's the same feeling people have here. And part of this part of this. Coming here tonight. Is to add the pressure to get this done quicker now we have a real unique opportunity it in the sense that were still dog on getting this thing done. I am getting it done in the quickest- most rapid way possible. I know we also have a new in from director over the TSC. So there's a real opportunity- for embracing a new approach to this in asking the real tough questions at this point in time right. Why is it costing so long why why is it taking so long- where their answers that suffice we accept them with those answers that don't suffice- we don't accept them when we challenge those things. On it and our colleagues here. I believe the been support of our recent efforts certainly. I know as as our community members organizations- and supervise least audit- do TST. As it relates to. Only introduced- the letter. And will continue to make sure to try to advocate that the- that the state legislature. Voted up so that the- stick- honor can actually do it's working on it. And it will be able to come back with best practices. And what really did happen and what's going on so when I can. Thank you one more time for continued- advocacy. I can't say enough that I live in the same neighborhood. And granted my kids have not. Been alive as long as some of you have been. Fighting with this good fight but the impacts are real. I'm not within the one point seven miles- the but I would agree that you. That that they still have an impact. Or land like to along some of the- toughest. Neighborhoods is released the pollution. Without rail road- rail rail line's we've had. Heavy diesel to drives around heavy industry not too far away from here with fifty five thousand cars driving in our land locked around freeways. I mean you know you you you live here too. And like you will are my kids also suffer I got with has my- severe asthma. So believe me that this fight is just as personal- for me as it is for you. And this is part of the X. as a getting this done in one of think. Again all our colleagues and supervisors lease for being here and really challenging the status quo so that we get this done. In the quickest and highest quality way. First thing we ever said we got when we got started on this so thank you. Think of symbol. You're welcome and thank you again- both of you for being here we are expecting. Of one more committee member to arrive shortly- but I do want to take a moment to welcome supervisor Hilda Phillies who were going to be hearing from on- the second. Panel social have an opportunity. To address your concerns at that time but- I want to thank. Supervisors police for being here participating in this event and also the county for helping to organize the event. So our first panel I will. Now and I'd like to welcome our speakers for that panel. Meredith Williams who is the- very new director of the department of toxic and substances control. I think- a director- Williams has been on the job for about six weeks now- but you'll correct me if I'm wrong by a couple weeks on. On that. I and we also have grant cope with the deputy director for site mitigation. They'll be providing us with an update on residential clean up at. And ms Williams you- I'm sure I have seen the questions- that are- in the agenda and if you could work your- comments if you could work into your comments responses. To those questions would appreciate it. Welcome to both of you. Thank you very much thank you chair bloom. And thank you to the other assembly members who joined us here today. My name is Meredith Williams and I am the director for the department of toxic substances control and with me today is grant cope our deputy director for site mitigation and remediation program. There are many other staff here with us as well as- it is of county PA. And hopefully that will help us answer any questions that may come up we do believe that the presentation the materials will be responsive to the questions of the committee. Thank you for hosting this meeting in the community- we always welcome the chance to provide. Up to date information and to. Keep people abreast of our work overseeing the cleanup of both the facility and the residences impacted by the contamination from excited. I know you're eager to your to hear directly from the community and we actually have found that the more directly we can hear from the community the better off we are in terms of how we do our work. So we appreciate another chance to hear feedback directly on their variances and their concerns and yes their frustrations. A few weeks ago I had a chance to come down and visit some area residents and also to meet with some members of the work crews who had gone through the workforce development program. Part way through the day Andreas Andres Martinez who in his or somewhere- who leads are workforce development team program team- commented about the number of stories that have come out in the course of doing this clean up work. And I'm sure you more than I have heard stories of loss and of illness and of the told contamination takes. On the people who live in the scan these communities. Throughout the day I did hear other stories. I got to see the closeness that is develops sometimes between a resident and the staff member buys them shoot through the clean up process. I heard families talk about going to great lengths. To take care of their pets during the clean up. One resident told me she can now host family gatherings in our backyard without fear of. Letting poisoning for her family and another resident another- couple talked about how they now have divided their responsibilities for maintaining their their yard- an integrated into their daily routine. I also heard from three brothers who found the that work on the clean up through the work program and talk they talked about what have what happened steady employment has meant to them. And it was really quite. Affecting and I think all of these stories really represent how internet the work we're doing is. We're entering people's homes were helping them relocate pets were talking to them about why it's so important to me ups done. People are placing a lot of trust in us. And we take that responsibility very very seriously. And we can only do this work if we maintain some deep level of engagement with the community so we're constantly striving to strengthen that can our communication. And to do better. The residential clean up is progressing settling we're now able to clean up about a hundred properties along. We don't have any we haven't encountered many so significant technical issues with the red presidential clean up recently. Our priority is to clean up as many homes as possible and to that end we streamlined a number of our- some aspects of the process and- simplified some things and we also think that will help drive down the cost because as we said. The priority is to clean up as many homes as possible and so we're being. Increasingly aggressive about containing costs. We're doing our best manage the budget but we are facing some high contractor costs and project cost increases. This evening in addition to talking about the facility in the residential clean up and will provide- will to this evening will also provide information about how the facility closures going an update you on that so there is a lot to discuss. And before I get to that just one more story which is that toward the end of the visit when I was out- visiting various properties a group of young school girls walked by in their school uniforms on their way home from school. And I actually started wondering what their stories were. On whether their homes in been remediated. Was it okay for them to play in their backyards. What what is the lead done an impacted how it impacted them. Gave me pause- we understand the importance of this work. And it's has to be done collectively has to be done in a ship with everyone who's here this evening. And this is another opportunity to really strengthen the that partnership and- continue to work so with that I'll turn to the presentation. So today will go over the rest of. So the boss about back hello. What is required to do under. On talk about the boat park is clean up and the retention. Talk about what we doing in terms public age meant around that. Will on the force. At which point out that over the grant and health about budget contracts. Sec as a reminder what the bloody. Like if you go yeah this this is what. Before we begin the clean process. And is there the three segments were there and this is a picture that was in in October- and as you the segment one long hair. And focused on segment one segment yeah I do- some of the crop attention to say to into the coverage the sweets maybe artist but there is covering- of the pull up structure there and up isn't yours in that. In that include. That of it. The approach for the demolition and clean up the first the to do that we can phases the for phases to address all of. Route structures and the deep structure in the D. emanation. And we're- moving. And bring that back to be we take great pains to make sure that the work. Done so please and this work X. is risk some of and it's higher labor. The cost and- state funded being for that for this work. Dahle about ground structures will merge into the low and. Can and do an assessment autumn report clean and that as after we that there may be a phase three is needed. So with respect to phase one. And that that stays is more than percent complete. At this point on. We can one since twenty six. And but we are significantly behind regional time estimate schedule or how long it would to do work. Fact team months and the of the low the- amount on it will be. This one moment cation will be were bring exile do. Us one permit modification on a scale change. As we got. In the one tale up review of this proposed schedule change in the in and public comment period so- look for that and would be happy to report on on that as as it goes forward. So and then I didn't want me to. In order and then I want to- talk a bit about the facility in closure as I mentioned- and as the slide illustrates there have been. In they've been great cost. In the unit yeah- they are a polity when happens is an air quality. Violation and it's all so- over the procedures that putting putting the for free and fair and then a second bridge. The end of your- and- after the first pre. Coast it is a violation and we be December. The second bridge are you in January should. More than a statement late we actually have recall them back look at this. For your- the- issue is so that the would tell us where is being added I'm and skin and then all of. But certain things are really forced to be those bono. Is a- to be thank fact have drinks at work actually complete leave me. So keep an eye on. And closure and make sure. To stand. On you know the is get back to a drop this is. To be invest mission D. R. X. is responsible for doctor thorough testing hello contamination old enough. And they needed an of what we Rick refusal investing to us deemed it it in at. And as a result we reject that were and have take taken steps to take to make sure that a proper investigation gets done and also what we call a corrective measures study- however excite is disputing our determination that that- that that. Are a five- report that report is insufficient and were in dispute resolution resolution process nevertheless were working to make sure that that. The things are in place of that that investigation can be completed properly. That's where we are with the facility. And move on to the park ways and the residential areas. And it's been about the ways should spend is but where are of and that getting Burke wasted levels of can nation taking act if completed the same. Of ways and- we also issue next year. So for our because men and it actually up in for. The good stand how. Breaks loose news. Part is important to the right so done that we talked asking to help is the ways. Buses address in Europe all got of. We expect out of those documents available by summer a and a public com. Into the clean out based for the rest. The residents clean up yeah I think it when he as well miglior with with the- one seven preliminary invest. There are if we take a number there are more than a thousand missiles within them one point seven mile radius with a simple for the five hundred of the house. And as of this week the teen hundred X. the properties. There are six hundred thirty still. There we have not. Where we have not been going back to sample board to do clean. Right now we have three three. Is an old and says that's been done to contractors allows us to get a hundred. I want to talk a little bit about what process look like. And what steps we go through when we clean up. First is the and permission to sample and- up and door property Asian special school board and convert shins folks in the process what. It moved. He for instance after in the process of the to be okay and I don't buy into choices for what for they want in proper and work out all the D. and the scheduling details and once that's all done Reese schedule the clean up again working very closely with the resident making sure that- they can manage the logistics and whatever else it's just obviously very destructive to- day to day lives and so we've taken a great deal care with the scheduling. And then. Eventually of course the clean up clean up crews go into the field and do the work the excavation and the remediation and- after that's done we do. Sit down with the resident confirm that the clean up workers comp the we have quality check lists- and we make sure that. Everything's in order. So you can see there are a lot of touch points throughout this process so it's really not possible to get this work done for not in good communication with the community. And I want to talk about. It more- there's just. The site it is to our- water order do. Or not and where to get thanks you. Understood the problem the- we have a local person com. House be more simple. Do a number mail I do are. The yeah website eight here ace the start also in two. To make sure that we get the word out about. Activities the area meetings at Centro we only to we not only can mean but we a we have into as my other on. Meeting in areas possible and we have our- thirty eight member excite technical advisory group. And so- Bob. Keep talking come back to that in a minute- so when you add that all up and look at for instance what does that engagement mean. Is it for instance in the nineteen. Fifteen minutes the prince communities and up we have dedicated line hammer. We encouraging people to call us and tell us when you're of problems right away three one. We fielded fifteen hundred call a hot last year. We do. Educated with participation daft age men name their- better than committed. And when you added a it's just a lot of. I've been around. There's we hope our a meetings your and three can. And meeting of con tap. And we do. The space language interpretation is. This we publish the age may count or twenty not. Three meeting and- someone. Just can to provide our for to learn about what's going on so. Continue that engagement and then of course folks we want to make sure that when folks go online they find the information you're looking for. Only a lot of progress and information sign. One of the questions asked. To speak was corporation with also- were. Others agency there are call for the record and it. Mention to some basic yeah this call so. We are- we're needing with the low jurisdiction. We help local we have a monthly coordination home with account. We have. Who sharing information with the lead abatement program it's a very active. So I want to switch gears a bit and talk a little bit on a workforce development program the workforce for environmental restoration and communities this is a program that spent. The rest of us. Anyway is a- and have have Gen. Make sure the community itself Bennett that's begin. The clean up and so of course look for. It is through for Gramm leach. Either with. Investigation finds quite a number of a that we set our local one. Get perfect in terms of getting in program again. Being an- the room at the end this point on a team going up well I have a chance to with a number of. Who had through program and are. Seventy one graduate. We've gone through six words different folks- since. More clean up right now there. One work is done the proper. At the project uber manly people are getting up we and- and that get the community Russell are benefiting from the this opportunity as our hope is that of course in the long run backed- this will lead to other. Opportunities other employment opportunities perhaps through the union there are many other avenues of folks continue to do this kind workers and tell there were three. Once have experience. So that's where we are with the residential and the- in the park with clean up and at this point grant will talk to you about the dollars and cents. I'll be talking about the budget the contracts for the residential clean up right now we start with about one million dollars with expanded about a hundred fifty seven million dollars that essentially these but ninety four million dollars for the remainder of the clean up. About 81% money expand that's far has been for the clean up of Ste well. The person has been for ample for and of the money that we spend. Ridley to clean up our act please. One or clean up. Prop. The cops are- for but at this. Thank you the drop for. Contract we go in to on the contrary we- both in contract manage social help. Okay the country of. As well the way we- that's costs were most. And to drop. What is the time of con is. Time there if you were was not workers will. Office the next it. The does tend of I track only in a really. Cost is in a. Isn't it over to. Cost play cost materials have priest so. Project it is center very long black. Even if the price this is the is it normal to cost per. If you find term time material. In context of the work you're doing and what a as opposed to it different of concept. Yes in a time of contract you'll to go out for the day and do a property let's say takes them ten hours to do the work and they move- fifty cubic yards off the site. They will charge you for the full ten hours. And they'll charge you to Holloway those fifty cubic yards of material. I won said another site it takes them twelve hours. To declare the property and- the Holloway eighty cubic yards of material. So they're gonna charge you increased amounts of money because around the field longer in the movie more material. That contrast rather sharply with- type of- contractor we're trying to move into which is called the unit price contract. That's where all of the costs for certain activities are spelled out in the contract itself. To going in and sampling. That's it that's a set price. Moving certain amount as well that's a set price it just provides more certainty for the state. For the amount of work that they can pay. For any particular clean up. So I can see where- there may be cost savings in the second kind of contract but. The time and materials contract would seem to incentivize the possibility of spending more time the necessary on a job site- but on the flip side. The other contract. Could influence in the opposite direction wise one preferable over the other night soon there's oversight that's provided on uncle there is a credit card. That you you're absolutely right troubling we have people out in the overseeing the work done by contractors- we- not not only had have what we call- we've got engineers you know other individuals who will go and- look at the quality of work that they've done. Make certain that they're doing it according to the clean a plan that we produced for this for this project we also have other quality controls which I can go into a little bit. Where we have when you say we are talking about DTS city crier department clear. Independent of the contractor overseeing that work that's right. That's right. We also this is important when a when a project is done we'll go back and walk through the property with the- individual who lives there. To make certain that the project itself- got a list it's called a punch last will go down it just took off or something is not- up to par for that individual. And then will work to try and correct that- whatever that problem is. Thank. Questions to- arctic now. The it's just a curiosity right because I would. I'd I I'd ask you know why do we think about the most efficient ways of doing it from the very beginning instead of looking at the most efficient ways later. I'm not I'm not that technical expert on contracts right and I'm not. That you won I did speak with my previous experience service community college for dealing with project managers told me that there's a number of different contracts that can be set up in the onset right- you have open book which will be laid out in you determine the profit based on open books and the different names for them but they all get the same thing- person- percentage of profit. That everybody agrees on Ansett price- there is a there's- would you say- there's a set up amount and then it just depends on how fission- program managers are the maximize their space in order to get the largest amount of a profit possible- and then there's a set- well there's a number of other will try but- the one that at least efficient always is the one that charges. Yeah because the way it in in oftentimes it's the highest burn ratio on the program manager side in. Ali a maybe you are directly involved in that but if I can understand that I'm wondering how do you TNC could not understand that from the very beginning could we struggled all the same things we came on and- we- completely reformed. S. and it is difficult for me to understand how how these things could have been caught. Day one in knowing the most efficient ways to actually do a contract. Yeah I know some remember- so you're absolutely right my understanding is the department did try to go through a number of different. More set price contract structures here's the problem this is one of the largest most complex clean ups if not the largest most complex clean up that details he is done and they clean up hundreds and hundreds of sites all across the state. When you're trying to construct a contract. For that type of- very logistically complex and by that I mean. Each one of these parcels that is being cleaned up is different. And so when you're trying to construct that without. Information that people can use to gauge how much money a particular parcel will cost. It's tremendously difficult to get a contractor to actually sign the contract because for them. The potential exposures huge if they agree to clean up say five on a properties. And they come up with an estimate on a per parcel basis that turned out to be wrong even on the margins a couple hundred dollars five hundred dollars thousand dollars suddenly their exposures far beyond what their risk model would otherwise except to what what did he is he did was they tried to come up with that you know price contract at first. But they just didn't have enough information because they hadn't cleaned up. You know five five hundred eight hundred properties so what they did in particular I'd of the tremendous amount of pressure on the department actually deliver the cleanups. Because up until that time they've gone through the E. I. R. process. Which which is great comply with state law. Back to a time. Then they were in a position of trying to develop a com the- contract one of the largest cleanups ever undertaken in the state and people wanted to see shot on the ground and so they made a decision that would enter into a time materials contract. And also bring on contract consultants to help them both trying constrictors costs but also over time once they knew more about that the kind of the risks inherent in cleaning up properties that they were trying to do a better contract contact structure. Is that the- answer. To going to the next slide. There's some additional activities of lead to increased- clean up costs that are just. Kind of inherent within the- Daschle project itself. In the case can you to. Mobilizing remote eyes again and then and that time. Sample there is in the house dollars are there are. Spent on being their allies honest cleaning up so some of to be expected. We up. Guards we can we want to and I'm- the time and force duration this is their home so we necessarily have to be flexible scheduling but when we do that there's an inherent costs and that's just part of. Working in an urban environment where you're actually digging up people's yards there's change there's changes have been made and landscaping materials. That has a cat coming. Because if you you plan for a certain amount of clean ups over a week. And if people modify their request for say them out of sight in the yard or they wanna go from side to rocks. You'll you'll have to purchase that potentially on the spot or you'll have to make certain that you have that moment. Actually cover those properties if you don't then you go out and buy it so all of that also increases costs there's- normal interact interruptions for work such as rain delays etcetera. So recognizing this week we've taken steps. Already to reduce costs and burn in the midst of the kind of final negotiation period with some one of the contractors to transition from a time in which- contract to unifies contract. That's really the biggest cost driver right now we've taken other steps to reduce costs but just in terms of overall impact. That's really where we have our I sat. And then park was funding- legislature six point five million. Dollars to do both as well clean up. We can as- your outlines state we clip pleaded the leads twenty four the number is. Expect about were we needed which would we gonna spend one point two million the next. The next big step process. On a contractor to actually for parks. That's that's what we're here for you today and we're happy to answer any additional questions clarify things. Yes a he said that you were working on a contract change it's one of the two contractors appealing which contractors that. It's Parsons. Okay can. I had the pleasure of attending year community hearing in the city about only to see some of year passes between the two contractors in person being much more expensive- all along the way and concerns about even who with the contract the- people there to oversee that contract and so forth where there was some sort of. Indirect and direct take to Parsons- along the way and they spend. A lot of concerns about the Parsons contract in particular so in addition to make in the type of contract. A putting other safe crisis there to address some of the community concerns. So by some of the other can you concerns- one of the things that we've heard is when something is damaged on the property they want to make certain. It's actually fixed. And so we do a process whereby we work with the people who live on the site. And if something is damaged. We've got that punch list that we go through we noted. And then we work with the contractors. To make whatever middle steps we can to address that that problem another can I just ask a clarifying question are you are you are you hearing concerns about oversight of persons that's the so that's part of your question is yeah not just with the cost of the actual oversight of the work you're doing it right being safe if- and so there's been. Different such as average that'll have one or the other and what we care the most concerned about the work that's actually being done has been tied to presence I do want to speak to the safety issue because this does come up and I know there is a bit of. Fusion because- folks look around at the properties as a getting cleaned up and they may see people wearing different types of safety protect in a protective equipment. And it's confusing to folks- because depending on what stage the at what stage the cleanup is. This is the step the workers may be wearing booties they may be wearing other protective equipment or if there's they're handling the clean filtered they may have less protection and it's be it can be very confusing and so we've what we've done is we've- we just ask people to call the hotline if they have a concern but we know that's one concerns. That's out there- and I don't know if you want to speak to any of the other oversight concerned about how we- how we just not modern the contractors in the field just on a day to day basis. Yeah in terms of addressing- safety issues on the site the- there's a requirements in these are all spelled out in the clean up plan where if- wind kicks up above a certain- number of miles per hour. We just check the operation down we make certain the swells covered- during excavation activities during dignitaries- we make certain that the soil is kept moist wet so doesn't blow up- eight and to be able so they can inhale it- there are monitors set those up when and down wind to ensure. That you know we know how fast the wind is going- and also were monitoring to see if any of that wind tech sector- within the area. The those are some of the kind of issues at least that I've heard that a percolated up- have you been have you heard of anything in particular that we haven't mentioned. We could speak to. I'm I think it's in a moderate there's definitely are people in the proper gear employees- save. Are we making sure that the third isn't playing around. It's also the question of whether and whether or not there's full disclosure when there might be a section where they can't fully clean up the soil and why is that. On and then the finding out later so it's there's a lot of here behind what's the purpose of all this clean up and- when residents are being alerted to. To these pockets that might could be impossible to get to what that means. The hearing about that at the end and so. Those are also concerns for community members tied to the par since work in particular. Yes for both Parsons as as any see. And this is because it's a requirement across the entire project. There's a map. That is- basically created for each particular a parcel. And they will mark. Where there is oil that is to say higher than eighteen inches below. Ground service. And they will know. The depth to which excavation occurred. So the- and that is you know that is provided to the residents of that if they if they want to know exactly where- excavation occurred did not occur they have that as a- as a- written document. But but when I hear you're asking is I that is that being communicated in real time as the clean curry so we'll look at that I honestly don't know the feedback loop on that and I think that's something that we should. Expect a thirty two. Not just to finish off on that spot. It's been felt by community members that they're finding out. At the end when they're being told to sign up the final thing off. And so then they feel like well what else he hiding from me or you know and so. There might be a logical explanation but in real time it's not happening into there's a lot of anxiety about the work but after has. I know it's been left behind that's very helpful to hear thank you. For this is that I have to many questions again Mister chair you can tell me if the second was appropriate after the first of. Soap my first question is so if we had committed to the to our neighborhoods and our residents. A some percentage cleaning up we've it costs a little bit more the beginning that means it subsequently less homes to be cleaned up and now we're going to scale up. Or speed is a word used. In more efficient in the next phase. Where does that leave us in terms of percentage of work that was actually committed as a been some analysis as if we were still I know it's not a hundred let's say if it was a hundred is I guess eighty five I mean what what's the percentage. We have some idea or can we get to the that full commitment. So it's pretty clean up a sixteen under properties at sixteen hundred and six properties. And we've got- roughly ninety four million dollars- to clean up the remaining properties. We know that that is not going to get us to the full thirty two hundred that we wanted to clean up to. The question now for us at least is going forward for under a better. Unit price contract structure with Parsons. How how much will that drive down the price and we don't have a good handle on that because we're not yet under contract we think it's going to substantially- with Parsons could substantially drive down the price so for example on average persons around eighty three thousand dollars per parcel. We would like to get a you know price contract. That drops that down closer to around 700-007-1000 somewhere around there- were not yet. Nobody has signed on the dotted line so we don't know that that's going to be possible that would be a pretty dramatic. Reduction in the cost per parcel that they clean up. And then each part of the clean up in those reductions are realized. More properties can be cleaned up under that contract that would have otherwise been. Back in at this point timer we fully scaled up to expectations so the- so it ebbs and flows across the year because we're coming out of both winner as well as holidays- this is traditionally the slowest time. For being able to ramp up but we're going into the spring. And so this is the point at which we do want to see people beginning to about. Their operations. We're currently- at thirty three crews- but both- NEC is most Parsons want to ramp up to more than that. The sugar. In order for a- this will as you might talk about the non persecution- agreement and what I mean so people understand what that means in. One what aye remembers member the deep DTS. US attorney's office had deemed that. Excited would avoid criminal prosecution if they did certain things- part of that with this plan and now the date. Of DTS he's rejected the plan that excite means what that really actually means so we have a grasp on it I think you put your finger on it again home. Director cope can speak to this more in more detail but- they signed up an agreement in the settlement to do certain things and that included a thorough investigation and- corrective measures studies they haven't done those things and so we have asked the department of justice to wave than on prosecution. And to the chair and what does that really mean if they continued could they win a case could they lose the case what happens. Could date when the case or lose a case. If the you attorney gonna grow are to remove to remove that agreement. Yes they if they withdraw the non prosecution agreement basically non prosecution agreement was built on top of DTS these orders it says comply with the tias he's orders. After doing just said. I tried is clearly failed to do that we told them they have failed to do that we have also asked- the department justice to withdraw the non prosecution agreement once they do that they can then. Well at whatever stage they were in terms of investigating the criminal conduct that side. They could pick that up right away. And if let's say they were a week away from filing- against excite. They would be a week closer to actually doing it today. That's why we think it's important. Given that once we are somewhat. But we're a little bit circumscribed what we can do under the order because we got to go through this dispute resolution process we've added the order was the- state Attorney General it complies with all due process requirements. But that's- it just takes longer for us get to a point where can actually do truth Forsman. With the US DOJ. If they were drawn on prosecution agreement. They can move right for them to. But what is the do part for the different pieces designs proceed with prosecution. Good for on behalf of DOJ. Prosecutor for violating the orders in the agreements for non compliance will so that that's possible they didn't when they signed the non prosecution agreement- we don't know the full totality of what they were investigating- and it's really up to them to bring those charges that means the OJ right. They were made. The prosecution when the agreement was signed. And so not remember me yeah. Yeah but it it would be picking that back when that happens. Obviously there's the potential for criminal prosecution but certainly civil a prosecution would allow for. A potentially right a for more funds to clean up the eighty eighty community I would so I would suspect. Not to mention reimburse expenses. So it's really up to DOJ how they structure but it could- it has certainly restructured non prosecution agreements with other entities that they've entered into with waiting out of five. The agreement to require additional actions in this case it would be up to DOJ but surely could say. We will only let you go this far if you contribute action out of money. And then it's negotiation between those two entities. Thank you. Our if the- non prosecution agreement were to be dropped are there risks inherent in that to the TSA or the state. The only see upside. There were only upside we didn't fact fact requested so we think there's definitely absent okay I. If ugh ugh you could refer back to us like twelve I have some questions about the a to try and to. Just rolled out a little bit and for the system were better informed. Of ten thousand one hundred and fifty eight parcels that are identified in the one point seven miles all of. Area eighty roughly five eleven ample. Is the full extent of Sam. I think that comes under the act. Right if we get access to other- other parcels we can continue sampling so officers under under it- parcels if I at eighty five fifty five and sixteen hundred. That and tell on fifty. The close. Your cool but it only does matter of. We have a nasty to her so we don't rely on a her for doing the copies but- it would be useful to know- what the you know what what is represented by the difference okay and how that breaks down do you have none the Silicon night. Okay we'll get that to you. I and can I just say one one thing about that for those sixteen hundred personals and the average. We don't write anybody off until we've gone through of really exhaustive process. Of trying to get in touch with them and even then we still are open to suggestions as to how to get a little property members property- owners and we're talking about seven. Attempted engagement in some cases and that includes certified letters and things like that. Just want to point that out. And assembly member Garcia if I subtract. One thousand six of six and sixteen hundred from eight thousand five hundred and fifty five. What. The. Eighty five five five. That's all five okay I've moved I'm- public thank you for thank you for the detail of- but but- what what I'm what I'm getting at now is. A we've sampled. Eighty five eight thousand five hundred fifty five parcels- cleaned thousand center and six and then there's another Cristina we don't have access to. I backing up estimate will by housing how far off of my- a little bit. So the so there's around five thousand parcels remaining- to be cleaned is that right. What and how much time we spent on the initial phases. Of we started cleaning when. Sir I just want to add in one other factor not all the properties are above eighty. So there's some certain percentage that are lesson. And I don't have those numbers right off the top of my head but I'll I'll get them to you so what I'm getting at- by going through this exercise is trying to get an understanding of. Even with the efficiencies that we're talking about here what's the timeline look like going forward. It's there's a couple different ways to answer that I don't want to insult the wrong way so. In terms of. Keeping our intent is just to maintain the pace of work and as as as- we mentioned the idea would be to ramp up now that spring is coming in to get more even more than one hundred property stone a month. So that's that's our goal and you can just. We'll just keep going until on we don't have funds and then we'll look for the other funds will assume you have fun we have I'm just from- from the first time you have fun- what how much work is left to be done. Zoom to match the presumed workload. What is the time frame. Of let's suck- additional. Let let's let's imagine at the current pace. Is the future place. Hundred fifty I'm trying to give the folks here a sense of. Where we are in time with this project because I think we're talking more than three years. Three for four years. Can not these are not numbers that I think anybody should hold you to it might take longer right but hopefully your wedding on strategies. To actually reduce that time which I think that's commendable and a good idea- but yet. Another three years or so certainly in in the- communication with members of- of the local community who were affected- you've identified a lot of different. Means of communication which I think is great- but you haven't mentioned texting which- to me is one of the most obvious ways of he met back folks out there would you appreciate the ability. To communicate back and forth by taxed. But I know I know you that much more than email today- and I don't think I'm exceptional in that so if you could consider adding that to the ways. In which you communicate it might actually be more efficient. Of and then with respect to the- remaining funds there's about ninety million dollars left- in a best case scenario. How much further second take us. So it it depends on a lot of different factors- most notably depends on whether we can get into you know price contract. If you take a house going to be my next question. You know we have two different contractors and that's good because we want each one to be able to ramp up- to the number of cruise if they can sustain- so that we can clean up more properties concurrently. You know roughly if you take a look at the ninety four million dollars that remains. I think we can get close to about twenty seven hundred they're about. So about half give or take a of the remaining parcels and then they'll be a need for supplemental appropriation yeah. Thank you for that. Are there any other questions other questions this Garcia. Yes thank you. We have phase one of was a goal of thirty two hundred until at the rate at which we're going we're not going to have enough money from the Appropriations we have right now for face one we have face to homes that are above. Eighty and below four hundred which is still a really high level that need to be cleaned up and so we have many home fix that occurs a behind no one's going to be left behind- anything there's a lot of confusion and the community about. What that means for now face one and even face to our face the whatever the additional basis we have here. And while the- well we've appropriate at this money. We do have the potential for more money seventy coming in through two different bill for the community has worked on the battery fee fund us so that we can see a future. I to make sure that we were not leaving homes behind can you speak to that a little bit. Yeah so we are looking and- at those bills and what they mean in terms of us. Prioritizing different cleanups and- because that is a statewide. Initiative however. We recognize that this is an ongoing clean up and first of all as- as we talked about any interruptions to the work that's going on here will only end up being more costly. And so whatever we can do to maintain the work and continuity of the work and use available funds were ever those funds com the better off we're going to be and so we're very motivated to make sure the other funds or- any other funds that we- have a have a have available to us can get used honest. To again keep the crews in the field keep the momentum going and so what as we look at the dollars that we do have we talked about the Parsons contract but we haven't talked about the NEC contract and- less I remember seeing that it was a substantially lower cost per household. Without contract and to do can you speak to. Why we have the disparities and if there is separate to try to expand the NEC contractor. Is just trying to figure out the discrepancy here and get the most bang for our Buck. Yeah over the life of the their participation in the project in the sea is rich in about sixty eight thousand dollars per parcel so substantially lower than the eighty three for persons we're in the midst of finalizing an amendment and then the number seven. To any seize contract that will provide additional partials- because were we haven't yet issued it we can't really speak to the particulars in it that's fine to say. That will contain hundreds of properties- that we believe- needs to be put into place. Because they're just- they cost less and do a really good job. A cleaning up partials relative to Parsons- we still think it's good to stick with to contractors because once again we can have more crews in the field. But in terms of any see where we were right on the cusp of reaching them a new amendment. So once we issue that and will become public but it's going to contain hundreds of properties. So we're very motivated to give them as much work as we can. Quite simply. The news cycle a single you know access question every time we me with PTSD what is it that we could do outside of a- finances that we could do because- if there are. Problems with- contracting that prevent you from sole sourcing and it's not my prog who does the work it's my proud of that. That it's done in a quick as to and- highest quality. Are there impediments that need to be changed legislatively that would. Allow offer a quick quicker faster more efficient clean up. Yeah at this point- just referencing back to one of my earlier statements. Of this being a large complex project- having contractors understand. The difficulties of implementing it we want to get them wrapped up as quickly as possible and that's really the most important thing. There are other cost reduction measures and we work with your staff and other staff for- other- legislators with local governments to try and streamlined reduce permitting costs for example- we're talking about ways in which we can work with a local governments to do our reach to some of the either sixteen hundred properties are people who are. Really responsive. I think holding hearings like this that- are publicized in the get the word out to people who might not. It's amazing but it's true that they might not know about okay that that letter that I got release they should call that number- it's really the accumulation of all these actions within these communities that helps us- make certain we gotta properties to clean up. And I really don't think that the that legislative statutory. Impediments are really getting our progress on the on the project and for all. I think we've learned a lot more much more efficient. As it is we'll continue to work on that but right now I don't think that's where our focus. Well Greta- I want to thank you- director Williams and- deputy director call for the- presentations this evening and to hope- one or both of you will be able to stick around for the public comment to. Becoming a long after our next panel. So thank you get it out I would like to invite to our speakers for the second panel supervisor Hilda so lease. Okay. I'm and we were expecting that Dr- barber for rare of the LA county department of public health and unfortunately she was not able to attend who was called away on other business- but we are very fortunate to have your doctor Cyrus Rankin in her place. There's right end up please remember if you want to make public comment which will happen at the end of this panel- got a card from a one of the folks who are. Roaming about in the auditorium and hold hold those cards up high so that other people can. Either retrieve them like this individual here- or you can get one. There you go. Thank you- supervisors police said thank you assembly member bloom and the subcommittee number three and one of congratulate you again for having this very important hearing tonight and also for the assembly members Cristina Garcia and Mister Santiago- who I know are have been very deeply engaged in this issue want to thank you and I want to thank the residents almost feel like asking people to stand up and just kinda. You know shake yourself a little bit because this is a very very- serious discussion we're having and what he's saying that because I want people to kind of bills off there's a lot of information and- obviously it's a Friday evening there's a lot happening in the county of Los Angeles and I do want to make clear that- our director for public health stuff to buy refer couldn't be here tonight because we another- fascinating. How can I say challenge that's facing the county if not- the entire. Continent and that is has to do with this- virus a corona virus so we're dealing with that right now and have been this morning but we're here today and I'm I will again want to thank you for your time and effort. Assembly member bloom for providing this opportunity to hear from the community I know. That's first and foremost what this is about really to hear from the constituents and I wanna give a shout out to well. Colorado who's the before he leaves. And also to all the stakeholders in the community residents in the people that have been impacted for the so many years of that this is been an ongoing- challenge for us here in in- the one point seven mile radius but if not. Perhaps even farther than that more than the ten thousand households that have been impacted I think there has been a lot of progress made I kind of one of begin on that no because I have seen- the difference in terms. At least attention being paid. In just a brief discussion that I had was father- John read earlier he tells me that there's been a series of other meetings. Just this week. With a kißm de and DTS see staff that have been here. And that that gives me some sense that people are finally really taking this- very seriously and at a level that we have not seen before- and I think it has to do a lot with their constituents in the residents making their voices heard. But also along with the leadership now in the state. In the assembly- three year leadership and yet this committee staff in the members that are. Seated here and also- I would say- are governor both governor's previous governor Jerry Brown who initially gave us some funding- to start this- knowing full well that that was just the first step. And I think with this- new governor Gavin Newsom these- in a unique. Position I think to help us out even more and I've seen it demonstrated already through. The passage of legislation that Dahle. Name address are simply woman care. I know that to a lot of lifting on the part of the community and people here in the room- and trying to figure out how those those funds are going to come to this community knowing that that legislation. Impacts the entire state but certainly this is one of those areas we hope that. Those funds could be- utilized quickly so that whatever mechanisms and formulas that are set up that we look at- income in low income areas that are in distress right now and if the pace that. Of we just learned- that it will take to clean up to get to the other six thousand or so households it's going to take some time. So I know I understand that we're going to need a lot a lot more help here. I understood initially that we were the TSC. In two thousand eight was targeting households of at least two thousand five hundred. And I just heard I think here that there that was now of up. To three thousand. Three thousand thirty five hundred which is which is great- but I know our goal is to really. Attempt to reach more households- I'm happy that the governor's budget included the seventy four. Of point five million this year and that was we want to thank the governor for that. Well that's money that I believe- can help us- in a small way to understand and hopefully get more teams out work crews out. On on the field and in the ground to help provide the cleanup but I'm very excited about AB one forty two because I know that that money. Is going to provide relief over time for many many years to come so I we want to work with the DTS see. And with our partners to see how we can try to expedite that- I am a little bit concerned about the fact it of. Fees regarding other regulatory agencies as appeared in the presentation may have some impact perhaps there's a way that we can work with those agencies also. To understand. The difference in the magnitude. Of the problem that we're facing here. And to work with us I know that there been other remedies in other parts of the state. And perhaps that can also be something in terms of legislative. Initiative to bring forward that concern to those agencies it also receives state funding. And perhaps there may be some mechanism for they can also provide relief- the deal with heavy trucks for example a ki&lt;c.cyan&gt; de. Of things of that&lt;/c&gt; nature- just in terms of fees that are administered. Perhaps there's a some waivers or something that could be looked at- one thing that I do wanna addresses that. The sixteen hundred- households where we've not been able I think the TSC have been able to contact the land. Landlords appropriately I think our county we may be in a position to try to help. Identify who those property owners. Bar treasurer tax collector. And perhaps that's something that we can work on I think I mentioned that earlier to. To Meredith. At a meeting I had with yesterday- in other words counties ready ready and willing to work and I think we've demonstrated that. I'm very I'm very pleased that- initially we put in our own two million dollars just to do our own testing. And to come back and to share that with the previous- DTS see director in terms of how this could be quickly expedited. And I really want to give kudos to Dr barber for were. Ferrer who was in here but our staff is. Very AB able to describe- with that has entailed and I do wanna let the community know and I think many of them. Present here know that we really took this very serious. At the county of Los Angeles where it we actually had our stay. Only tear and- from Munich about in actually help a survey. Five and homes. Under to that cost we did. Our and we're still. To out and with that also. Prepared to put. More on the tester. Today we have the outside is providing that would be doing the- since we started. And that's also Acosta spinning by the county were we're glad to provide that we know we have to do more because you're still. Many residents that are very reluctant to come forward they don't actually. At all times understand what that means. But we try think in fact to get back to them as soon as possible there are. Some of alarms they go off so that they know what actions to take and how we can help remedy that. And we do have clinics available here one that was just opened about two years ago and son son all east LA. Clinic that's available just to do testing and I think. The your your committee some of the members went out when you were last here. So I wanna I wanna you know just remind you of that. I think a in terms of what. We're trying to do is really- we've together other sources of funding that we have. We were able to secure funding- through Dealey so can you canyon settlement. Of five million dollars and we were able to set aside. To help us for cleanup so we set up a special- how can I say a process to be able to use and drawn up money to help is here with excite. So we've been pulling monies aside in any way that we can. In addition- to our- lead based paint hazardous remediation program we've also. A look to providing of and how can I say partnership with the TNC to start looking at how we can overlay the same households or- at least not or duplicate but try to reach a far greater number. Of households to begin that cleanup so we appreciate the funding that. That we received from the state- and through all of. Department of housing and urban development where they awarded as three point four million dollars but keep in mind that isn't just for the exciting packed it area. So we have to negotiate as you know with other- board members so we are we are dealing with that but our highest priority has always been areas where have. They have been heavily contaminated so we're going to continue to do that so in addition to that were also again looking at a settlement that we had with the California Attorney General. LA county and the city of LA a hundred and twenty million dollars settlement- with regard to Porter Porter ranch. So that will also I believe assistance in some manner and again- this is not been an easy. Process for us because other entities local governments don't think that the county should have been given. Us some of that settlement but we argued I think pretty effectively and that matter and that's where we can also use help so that our state partners understand that were also using new- measures- to try to extract in and receive funding here what we believe. Funding can be utilized in a manner that still conforms with cleanup so Lisa canyon yes very important. I very important how can we of. That additional funding do more and work together with the state and with our other local entities to see that that. That that happens- I wanted to just tell you that I know our constituents as to has been articulated by the assembly. Individuals seems to. Ring ring true and that people are still very concerned about why is it taking so long. To get their homes cleaned up. And one of the things that- we've learned also is it once people do have their homes clean. How are they made aware that the clean up is actually- verified- and if someone is coming back right and I know that maybe the protocols aren't set in place for that. But perhaps there can be made some assurances whatever that measurement is the people fully understand that in layman's terms. So I really do believe communication I think is going to be a theme you're going to keep hearing about. Because while things are happening on the ground with the cruise a clean up it's always about the communication and the cultural competency. And the cultural competency comes through in terms of the contracting. The people that are on the ground and your staff fifty TSC but more importantly I also think that it's important for us to think about how we can. Probably help to bridge this miscommunication by having another set of eyes and I know that you have groups now that you're contracting with the east side yards. But I would like to suggested perhaps there's a way that other groups community groups are already doing this kind of work. Reaching out to the same people whether it even be on census for example people are knocking on doors for different things now. Perhaps carrying information along with that effort about what people might know or not know about what's happening with that side. And what that means so if there's a way that we can try to collaborate or create some form of funding that can be made available to those- third party groups but our vested here and have the credit the credentials. The credibility I think that that could be something that should be looked at and whether you pull that from DTS see or from- department of. Health could probably be a way of maybe- bringing that together I know we've been able to couple for funding. Streams together through a pull health. To do. That very same our so I don't see why the state couldn't explore. Some new avenues to try to try to bring on more- more staff that are capable of doing that- I would just say the other thing is. I think I think we ought to really explore what- what is happened with respect to- excite not being in compliance. With the TSC and DOJ- I know our county council we've had those discussions. And were more than happy to work. Alongside with you. The TSC in the state to see how we can leverage that. So we can try to get more for our residents here because I believe me in my opinion personally speaking. As a collected official I would have never settle for. For this agreement additionally and I think that I think that's really important- just to say with that. We have some very able able and capable people here- will speak in more detail about some of the questions with- the particulars of what we've been doing but I do want to keep keep you are fully aware that. You know we represent- East Los Angeles mostly heavily impacted here but the other cities that have been impacted bill commerce- burn in. A may would. This del all all of them deserve to have the same level of the- treatment in terms of getting information out there are no a series of meetings have been help. Make you need to happen with the cities but I do think that. A crew has to be made available that will be able to articulate. With the various cities also in explaining because we often get calls. Of from some of our local residents that we represent in those areas as well that sometimes the information is not. Is not given in an appropriate consistent consistent manner and I would ask that more meetings be health. Of a on a smaller scale so that smaller cities and groups can come together and understand and they're looking at. Apples to apples and- that that it that- that we get some feedback about how that is being conducted- and just lastly I'm happy that. I'm happy that we have a new director at the TSC- but I am too concerned about the two contracts. Of more importantly with Parsons in anything because I think there can be some. Cost savings in terms of contracting and- trying to lower lower any administrative- or other costs- and looking at how we can open up opportunities perhaps with other contractors. And really see in- you know the best the quality but also looking ahead in terms of workforce because right now we have competing interests in terms of who is capable of clean up. And many of those individuals are working on some of our construction projects as we speak now. In terms of retrofitting housing that we need because we have an urgency with homelessness. So we're pulling from the same pool so we need to grow the pool so I would ask that. The state also look at using some of those workforce training dollars that you have that the governor's put in his budget. To set aside in can- for projects like this where where we find a shortage of individuals that are available in perhaps as a pipe effort maybe look at. Of places that have been- impacted because of health and other issues that are I know are of great concern to our governor. So with that- I would just leave leave you with that and thank you for the opportunity to be here and to thank the residents. And everybody that has been working so hard- the fight goes on. Is what I would say. In the fight because on and we have to. Keep our eye on goal. Thank and because about it so with that I wanted to do so doctor still be opening at the who's here. She's the regional health officer first boss seven which we are in which includes east LA southeast LA and the exite. Impacted area would turn it over to her and her staff. Thank you thank you thank you very much for those comments- and to for your on going interests and- truly a dedication on on this issue and you have a lot of. The expressed a lot of comments- concerns and ideas I think they're all. Of consideration and- looking forward to the- next presentation. I'm sorry we don't have name cards for all of the show we have a very professionally done one for a doctor Russian. Mister chair on behalf of doctor Ferreira director Valley county public health I want to thank you for inviting me here tonight. I want to thank you for the work that you've done on this important issue as it directly impacts the health and well being of thousands of Los Angeles county residents face. A continuing risk of exposure to lead contaminated soil on their own properties. But I also want to thank and acknowledge the work of supervisors so release on this issue. Under her leadership LA county has undertaken significant efforts to. Secure funding for the investigation and cleanup of that contaminated communities impacted by Exide technologies. Battery recycling in Vernon. I want to thank the community for your- of continue demands for expedited cleaning up all exterior contaminated lands and for the- cleanup of the interior of homes. As requested by community members we have expanded services in the community. We offer blood test as was mentioned- previously at a lot of locations and functions in that are- go- are available here. Tonight as well as in our on health center on Sunland the supervisor mention. We are also expanding the capacity of the local health care providers to screen young children for developmental delays and to connect. The affected families to needed services at their local schools. In just a in- to say something in Spanish KT yeah I mean this and then landed us yes us but we soda force who needed asco in a stable that phone those pada. A misty Gatling get level meaning that point I mean now the board. Four nine three seven eight technology. Yelled at hero and now have to. Turn it over to Dr Rangan. Of the medical texts. Toxicologist with environmental health by LA county. Thank you very much- Dodge creative- I wanted ext also extend my thanks to the assembly members for putting this together and helping to sort of shepherd this whole thing through the state all in all of the work the really gives us the starting point say where we can do. Our work and also to supervisors Lisa you in the members of your office that really- keep health as the front of the line issue and despite all the- work that all of our elected officials are doing on the regulatory frontier in the contracting in the finance and the legal issues- we are all here for one primary reason. And that's that's our health and everything else is supporting the port of that- and- new- Mr Garcia made a an important point about you know trying to see how we can all put our heads together about doing things faster- because this is not just an important issue in public health isn't urgent issue in public health and is the urgency. For me that- you really sort of resonates about this whole situation we need to always continually look for ways and sit back broadly and put our heads together to try to figure out how can we do this faster and I know there's probably ways that we haven't thought of yet. And we need to continue to do that- all that being said- I think what's important result in a in a lot of what I'm saying I've said before it many public meetings I think it's always good to remind ourselves about the importance of this health issue here. We learned a lot in the past twenty or thirty years about how human health is very tied to our to our environments and we always knew that but now we know a lot more about it- than we ever did and when you look at the contamination that excite has rained down on this community not just for the past ten years twenty years thirty years but for the past. Eighty to ninety years- and we have- so much contamination that has- impacted this. Just bear but also on the ground as a result of that it's just an atrocious situation when it comes to can unity contaminate. It and then. How for decades I'm sure every knows this room Exide operated without a permit and because they were operating without a permit we have a significant lack of data all the emissions that may have been occurring over the past many decades and so we don't have- the ability to truly estimate. The impacts of all of those chemicals over all those years over all of your lives and that's very unfortunate so what that puts us the position that puts us in in the health department is that we have to take what we know now and try to provide services and resources for you moving forward in order to make sure that your health is maintained and you can live as healthy lives as possible- when it comes to. Lead contamination in particular which is what we're talking about today there are multiple sources of lead in our environment we've known this for a very long time even in this bottle if you look hard enough there's a little bit of light in there we know that we are exposed to lead in small amounts from many different sources- one of the primary sources as many of us are where are is lead paint that is in many homes. But when it comes to community like like this that communities that live near the exite facility you now have this extra layer of unique and obviously unnecessary contamination and it's right in your front yards in your backyard so if you're homes. And that is a very very unique kind of potential exposure to lead that you have that the other folks in the rest of Los Angeles county don't have as supervisors Lee said we have our our our- our our truck outside where you can get free let testing. We do that around these communities there's one other area where we do that as well that's the communities around Gwinnett co big surprise right and we don't really have that service in most of the rest of Los Angeles county because they don't need it as much as he's communities need it. And you're gonna need that service for the foreseeable future and until all this contamination has been taken care of until all the homes are. Seen that Sir is going to have to be there and that's what I want to come of you know highlights is as the goal I want to eliminate that service. I want to get to the point where we don't have to have that service anymore. And once we get to the point where all the homes are clean we're one step closer to that. So when it comes to exposure to lead exposure to lead can cause a number of different problems. But there are some twists and turns about that but I want to kind of talk to you about. We know that led can affect multiple body systems we know it can affect your kidneys we know can affect your liver we know can affect your brain. And a number of other organs in our body- but you the way that led works. It's a little bit like. Like having high blood pressure. Here's what I mean by that. If you look at a person who has high blood pressure you can't look at them and just kind of know. That person has high blood pressure. High blood pressure is one of those will be called silent diseases where people can have it for a long time and longer you have it the longer you have it. The more it affects your body and then later on you start to have- real issues heart disease. Stroke a risk all kinds of problems like that. Latest kind of the same way you can have letting your body and the more that you have a risk of being exposed to it and the more let that builds up in your body over time. He can be very very silent and then as soon as you get to a point. Enough lead in your body. A lot of bad things. But and those bad things and- they're very hard to reverse. So that's why we want to make sure that whenever we are dealing with lead exposure for lead poisoning. The most important thing about that is preventing it to begin with because once it already happens it's very hard to- put the toothpaste back in the tube right that's the sort of the way that we look at it. So prevention is what it's all about and the way that we can prevent more lead poisoning is by clean these are is to prevent that exposure. When children go outside and play. Yeah whether we like it or not children eat about one to two tablespoons of dirt on a per day when they're playing outside. As a as a your plane looking their hands in accumulated that it's about one to two tables and that's what the estimate is. And the children in the playoffs. If they're there should be a reason why children can't play. Outside in your front yard in the backyard and your neighbors yards. And so to have a situation like this where. You now basically can't live a normal life. Right have your children play outside- that's a big deal to us and so clean these homes is not just about- the strictly the health issue of lead poisoning but it's about your general likelihood. And that's why it's important issue to us of the public health department. So the response the seizure of course requires very pollution cleanup of all these properties. And the allocation of funding necessary in order to make that happen. Now young children and families were exposed to hazardous chemicals over long periods of time whether it's that. Or something else brings up a lot of issues in terms of the services that we as a public health department. Need to make sure that you have available. And so want to talk a little bit about some of the services that we're making available have made available to the community and we're still working on as well. The first is to make sure that we insure. That there is good enough- access to information and into services. As the supervisor said we've got you know a few- local- department of health services comprehensive health centers. That are in this area those are made available to residents to receive- free helps at this health services in general and also free let let screening. And then financial screening as well for your family to evaluate- where you can fit in with health insurance etcetera. And also this permanent- county resource center that was established to provide support. And information for the community as well let let screening as was mentioned to. And other resources as well to- the residents around the exite facility- it's also important to us to link the community residents to healthcare resources. Particular to that free blood led screen it's want to talk a little bit more about that as well. Since about- two thousand sixteen or so- we were offering but let's be a little bit before that but it really started to take shape around two thousand sixteen. Since that time we three to six thousand residents so far who'd been had a blood lead tests- through those efforts. Including four thousand. And that's just the F. that were talk about the three blocks screening. Dish to help provider who are. Doing let's screening is a- yeah are to. Is refer lots family as well the- to provide to. A may this test as well. That's we improve the Gen away. But I also wanted a highlight the- the community outreach that- that we've taken on as well. As supervisor said we've had a lot of different outreach campaigns that we've been engaged in since around two thousand fifteen. Around the time when the facility was closing- to inform residents about contamination on their properties. How to protect themselves in their home- about the efforts that the state is undertaking as well and the importance of blood lead testing- and in addition member it this is. Not only about lead right there are some other chemicals had this facility- released into the environment as well. A number of different gases and all of these chemicals have raised your- risk of long term health effects so it's not. Only about let it's about other chemicals to and so we're- engage in efforts to educate you and also your healthcare providers about all the things that could be occurring. As a result of those exposures. Supervisor also mention the survey- that we did in two thousand seventeen. And altogether after those outreach efforts in the survey efforts and more door to door efforts we actually reach about sixteen thousand homes all together now- to- provide. Our region and link residents to the health services sat through resource tables etcetera we have a number community events that we do at. A church in community centers YMCAs and number rather different places. And for more details on that we have our table outside and you can- go to them they'll be able to tell you- more places that you can- I'll go for not. Let testing but just to get the more resources and get that letter sometime today you want or you. Talk to our folks out there you can such but to it at. An early time and I think we have we've done all a hundred of those can. Outreach event we plan do a lot more. When I get back to hell care for. As well because it's not only. Edge you about these but also your care. In this. So that they aware about what to out for and- the- are as I said because of the lack of. Data that we don't have over the last eighty ninety years about emissions that came from excite. It's hard to really put a number on the risks that people have we know that your risks of. Long term illnesses are elevated but knowing exactly how much is something we may never know the answer to. That's why it's important to make sure your healthcare providers are armed with the information to know. How should they be regarding U. S. patients what kinds of screenings are more important to do for you as you age. To make sure that we- catch disease early in prevent them from happening if possible. So we have been connecting with the- with healthcare leaders so all over the area. And met with about two hundred. Said that. In in the area but we it about proxy for. Miles of X. working. To efforts to a- of. About X. in general. How the health care needs of the as red. And when receive a- treatment when they- obviously again to. Ever the need for- for lead. Led screen. And we develop materials for them and resources for them to call us when they have- questions to- again you know we do all this stuff because we know the necessity of the it especially for this. Particular community and the- the issues that you've gone through the experiences you that you've had as a result of this contamination. And again my vision is I want to get to a point where we do not have to have. That truck out there to screen people for let it's great that we have it's great to have that resource for. All you. The bill seat. Stand your blood leads us. But would great if we to that point where we- clean up all these your- and got rid of. All and would have need for that anymore that's- the world I want. To an- and getting the done as quick as- is the first so with that. Wanted now. To not allow of our head. Next Janet Scully. And she me talk a little bit about our account. Of and resources the we are at to. A number these different efforts so. Turned over to a T. Janet. And we're gonna but and wrap separate. To eight thirty and still want to have time the people who was like. Up to a- as a think we've got a half dozen or so. Rick just. So within that time I will put the red things up for public. So it's a two about the exciting. The county used fund we see from the way. Say that. To educate. And learning to. Assessed for two. Live in the- impacted by. And so public health actually pie. A pro. To in. Development screening. And all families to. So that healthcare providers can I de. Per early. And initiate ness in other nest. Interventions and then I'm really excited to announce that the county receive funding to provide- lead paint hazard remediation. So and other home improve service to. Homes the exite area and as supervisor so least mentioned- I won't go into detail but we recieved. And two of sources of funding to do lead paint hazard remediation in this community we've already begun the work it's going very well- we have a table outside and with folks who can give you more information or you can. Fill out an application and see if your your home qualifies. I also just wanted to mention that the county received approximately a hundred and thirty four million dollars as the result of a twenty year hard fought lawsuit with three paint companies. And this funding will allow us to launch an unprecedented and county wide program to provide lead paint hazard remediation services. And that's scheduled to start in April twenty twenty and that will also include the exciting area this program will consist of community outreach blood lead testing- lead paint hazard assessment and remediation this kind of work has never been done to this size or this go. Anywhere else in the country so with the trail Blazers for this work- so thank you for allowing us to speak- public health really enjoys working is in this community even given the circumstances we enjoyed meeting you we enjoy working with you- we've had really great experiences here. And we hope to continue working really hard for this community- with that I wanted to let you know we have a short video and it really describes the lead paint repair services that are now being offered- again these are free services no cost to you and we thought this is just a really nice- demonstration of what you can expect. I see a blank in the sky. Which in this. He won't. Nay or stop. Darkness or- have reached home and my some born couple my after we didn't know was a in anything like that but when I him to get tested that came out positive his finger and then when he went and got his blood work completely that and I told me it was it was like a half an I've I was a cover I have someone relief because a it's carried know your has some in your aware it. Either also came when I. Also what color feet which is like for your home. And I think that's very important because it take into consideration our names tend. To you know make it our home because it is our home so we have to make sure that we're happy with the services that your house. Is up to call their house is safe and their houses comfortable because you to live in it. I see Lara mono. See I have a- level yeah lead can be a very silent please and you can be exposed to lead you convene poison lead and appear or look healthy for some time until those symptoms start to appear so it's important for parents to know that even though your children me looking if you're healthy now they could be incurring lead exposure in those homes and addressing that issue is extremely important to do now to avoid problems later. This definitely sets the stage the allocation of these funds to address lead paint in homes is unprecedented. And to do the number of homes in the time period that we're going to do them it's going to set a tremendous example for the rest of the country. We targeted those particular areas because these are areas that we know have a lot of old housing stock and we know that this is an under represented population as well. One of the most common ways to address lead paint in homes was assembly paint over it but this is a comprehensive way to get the lead paint out of office and to renovate them to the point where lead is no longer risk to the structure. My parents have lived here for. Thirty three years so the have been offering to remove the pain that. May contain less and hopefully that can be of good to our nieces and nephews to actually come in this of the house. And our cousins who are actually pregnant so you know I know that that's pretty hazardous for their house. I'm glad that they came and offered like. More more information about it. You see all this. Hi highlighter. Those are the ones are interested. But I'm a little for the acre goodness will be implicated the three most common as well say Los a automotive Chen us get benefit us us and giving an insight on this because you. Number zero one zero down. Who is that I guess we're going to build before today either well give you a quick demo on some of the tools are going to use that are using I'm not to get her all and as a result of training these experts in order to go into homes and not only do the deconstruction reconstruction but to specifically address the idea that lead paint is a hazard to young children and to the people of those households. This creates a new work force and new workforce it's able to go into these homes and not only address the problems of renovation of the problems of lackey. When my idea of fun nation. Or what the Downey program came. And we started doing the lead mitigation on the paint. I love the neighbors star a like kind of being curious and asking questions how can I get my housing to the program. When we talk to our neighbors or we're always like quick to say like. Oh by the way. You know your house is in the contaminated area you should. Contact this lesion long online. This effort is not only designed to renovate individual homes but it is designed to renovate entire neighborhoods it's not something that people should simply have to live with this is something that should be addressed as comprehensively as possible to get that let him out. And to have a life free help. You know when you see something. And see it happen then you know you can hear more yak nine find out as opposed to someone just telling you. But then you know you. Get senior in India. Now from our initial thoughts of. Yeah know a that going to have. And then. You know and actually did. Well thank you for that thank you for all the reasons tions and John we will move on to public comment now- I did receive one. A card that has the comment written on it and I think it's a Clara cation a request for clarification that's an important one it is from- Martha Jimenez who is with the excited vice re committee- and- city terrace. United at request clarification- for everyone- a by DTS see- and I think it expresses a misunderstanding- about- the- non prosecution agreement- so what I will I want to- make sure that we're clear about this. And if either doctor Williams at director Williams or a director- deputy director coke want to address this further than a statement I'll make right now please do so and correct me if I'm wrong. But the non prosecution agreement- does not mean that excite is being let off the hook. Quite the contrary- right now the federal government has entered into an agreement that says we won't prosecute Exide for crimes the non the if we get rid of the non prosecution agreement then Exide can be current prosecuted for the acts that they've committed whatever they might be charged with by the federal government. So it actually. Has the effect of creating additional liability- not less is that essentially accurate. So hopefully that to clear that up but it's a very important clarification- and to- I'm glad that you asked the question if there's any confusion out there- sore first up public comment if you'd like to step four would come from- Jane Williams and then will follow that with Joe Gonzalez. And senior John. Thanks for being here. I'm James I'm the executive director of California communities toxics and- I brought my excited file in a read it here on the train down in my file I had the notes from my meeting with secretary right Regus now almost five years ago. Which had the original agreement in it or the clean up of excitement and the closure. A that was. Well less than fifty million dollars now the cleanup is expected to cost most of billion dollars and take at least ten years. We are still not prepared for the magnitude of this clean up- despite passing the to better if you bills- we are desperately in need of the same things that we talked about when we had this oversight hearing last year which was we need a long term save. Agency because the clean up the details he is running. Fraught with problems and that such a that. For your still has not been able to get a copy if. The legislature can get accountability from the agency but I would say that the các members you have who are here in the audience have kind of lost hope. So ever the Lech. They're trying to fix that problem back there. Keep your. Uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh push the button on the base. Yeah okay. So this is this is not something this is not the problem that we have with ex I clean up is not gonna go away we'll be here next year will be here next year will be here next year. Will be here next year. We still don't have enough money. Even with the battery fee and we don't have the kind of accountability from the agency that we need to my recommendation to the legislature last year was to create a long term stable source of funding. We were able to get forty million a year through the battery she you can see that that's probably not going to be enough. On because there's gonna be other pressures on the fee as well. And we cannot get accountability from do TSC- I understand the you know the real reform package but I don't think that anybody who's watching the agency as long as I have been. Or other folks have been watching it in the last five years things that and oversight- board is going to solve the exite problem. So I leave you with that. I wish I had a different. Recommendation for you. And we definitely will support the audit the Assemblymembers Thiago is asking for. Thank you for a comma. A next up we have Joe Gonzalez. Welcome good evening- thank you all for attending I really appreciate this we need more meetings like this we it's really really hard to squeeze ugh eight nine years of battle into a couple of minutes- I want to thank especially supervised release one of the heroes of are. Contaminated issue here that we're going through and- hopefully we can get more funding to the public that the PH we need this additional funnies we can extend the kind of testing so we can find out what this is that we're actually feeling as you see this used to be my- day. These are health field medical tag from the last two years only and this is about only half of the stuff that I've gone through as far as radiation treatments chemotherapy MRI scans of everything that that comes along with being contaminated and poisoned by this stuff here- like doctor Rangoon was saying was weekend. It's hard to do a judge exactly what we have been going through but we need more no well unless we have more so we can get like say the bone studies or something like this we don't really know what we're facing in and the we need more appropriations from this. Committee here okay. What need. Is a thing that kind of. Angers frustrates more for. I get any about this because I dying any. But the in frustrates me is that we keep hearing or DTS see talk about. All we cling to thousand homes only cleaned up two thousand three thousand all of the old. It's kind of like you trying to get some sort of hysteria but all good you are the bottom line the truth is you have a clean up one single. Because of I just do like this. Doesn't mean the entire stages clean. They haven't cleaned the attics. It took a long time for them to try to clean the parkways. And the fact of the matter is that. We made test. A parkway. That need remediation but not a whole. That doesn't make sense we don't have a good plan- PTSD is letting us down tremendously. They do not have. An expedient nor efficient plan. We're talking about where the cuts the often and ways to cut costs. The easiest simplest long ago asked of them we ask them to do if you do a block by block you sweep. If you're gonna do a partial here and a partial there when you talk about individual parcels. Arsenal turns into entire block you're talking about more efficiently spending this money. You're talking about cleaning this right the first time not having to come back again a second or maybe a third time. Yeah. Wait what we need is we need some oversight on this too I mean it we have. I think was I forget what the number was it came from the state we have a couple of million also the came from the county. We have the battery tax which this community is really really upset these communities are really really upset that battery tax was a- imposing created so that we can address the exite. But yet we're being told that this some of this money is going to go outside. Up north in all these other areas like this and- in I don't have a problem with that if we can clean up our mess your first. Okay this is the public health crisis I don't understand what the deal is were. We're trying to say well we can't get into that property- we can't- get this person permission. Is a public health crisis. Nobody has my neighbor does not have a right. To get me the kids or anybody else sec. But leaving their- amination. To a point where it can flow into my- property. And get me or my good for the children sick. You know so I'm trying to follow the de. Stories that they're giving us about pro high priority homes. The high priority holding came out about seven years ago. Up and it was addressed to pregnant women. And children under five. I guarantee you there's nobody who was seven years ago pregnant is no longer pregnant- and are still pregnant I should say. And there's no children don't children that were under five they're still under five seven from seven years ago. And this is the story that we're facing every single day were not getting. Real facts from our from our of the TS in you talked about text messaging. I'll take that I mean just let me know. There's nobody who has been to more meetings I don't think to myself. You know concert in the TNC concerning excite. And stuff like that I think I missed one when I was really out of one of my cancer episodes. And up. I think all together in all the- nine years ten years we're fighting this. I've gotten like maybe. Two or three. Letters to my home. Regarding meetings and stuff like that everything else I have to go out there and put you know footwork. Look for the stuff we're not getting the stuff. And what also gets me too is we don't have the P. S. A.'s that we need we need something. We don't have to point a finger. Right an exciting perhaps you know put some sort of liability into the county or- state or something like that are. You know miss something that this up right there. But we do have to let the- know. That what we facing we go home. What what the kids are facing when they walk to school back to school what's out of playing the yard and stuff like that. We need to let the people know how to take care of themselves. We didn't we need to let them know that there's a danger. We have had many family that have moved into the neighborhood. Thinking they were going to. You know have the American dream. Reyes a vampire home raise a family. And live the American dream you know. So your child play baseball and- graduated from high school walking down the aisle stuff like that. But yet unfortunately what's happened is many many families here. And if we have a few families are just recently of with moved in the neighborhoods. You don't know a thing about what's going on. And their children were coming up. Here learning disabilities and stuff like this we know there's a lot of learning disability that's why just recently. I think of the state. Also wanted to adopt or raise the school level scores. At some of the local high schools up by twenty percent. And again they targeted Boyle heights by because we were at the epicenter. Of this contamination from that thank you very much for your comments. Okay I see the real hard it's real hard to squeeze like eight years into something that's why when I understand we need more meetings that's like. Not even half of what I got to play some of it is. Much more important I. Whether respect like. Thank thank you we appreciate that- next we have- Monsignor John and- that would be followed by Terry Cano. And Stephanie Casteel. Yes good evening thanks for. Here this evening and- we want to welcome all of you again and- I just want to. You at the attic door last night we had the- H. U. N. D. was here DTS he was here on Wednesday night and now you're committees here. I don't think Dr Jill it Johnson she's not here she- she had here tonight was she was here last night. Are you familiar with her study that she did on the baby's teeth. Now I just leave this ending. It does show the urgency of this problem- Dr Jill. Is a research scientist at USC that que. The school of medicine. And she got funded do this test. To compare the baby's teeth of our babies teeth here. As of those two other area another area. And when she did this test- if found out that our babies teeth in comparison to the amount of lead. Despite its just bikes in comparison to the community that she- said. Our baby's T. that means. That those babies. Are will be. I'm not a doctor. But it is it's a very serious problem. And SO we live in as is condition when I. Say that. It shall eat up to two. Spoons is a table sponsored table just is to have a- of doing it a day- our protocol has been there for the last. Several years. They're they're supposed to wash the feet the did take their shoes off- don't come into your dog should wash their feet before the game. The house down the food from the floor. This goes on for years and years- the final one it just ask that this equipment aye. No one's been able to really give me a good answer. Why is it. That if this houses been tested this spend all this money and testing the house. And they have agreed the children live in there. As soon fit all the qualities. That lead is a certain level. Why do they have to go back. Test the parkways why you said tonight the details he- told us that it was going to be UP I think two thousand and two. Before they would to finalize our plans after the do the test. Into dollars on testing. I'm not a done I miss. But I seem to me that logic. Is if I have let in this. I'm a and with that. Feet of. It for. From the blog way I should have lead over there also just doesn't. Doesn't aye I've asked this question before and you just get a B. S. answers so. I just to submit that to the people you heard that figures tonight you're part of the budget committee so please- I think this one way we could save millions of dollars in and- advance our clean up faster than it is. Being program right now thank you very much thank you. And thank you again for the use of the facility- a Terry Cano is next. Follow by Stephanie because- and to. I'm not sure if Martha Jimenez is still here but- may also have a comment. I can reach. Okay so- I'm Terry Connell. I don't even know where to start first let me address some of the questions that I have regarding the contracts of first and foremost the sixteen hundred they said they they could not get access. To the test. I know resident. Who wants it who is a part of that sixteen hundred who wanted to get their property tested in this is just a couple of weeks ago. And we should contact them. To get her property tax- tested they said that they were unable to get those that get her property tested because they don't have a current contract for. Testing those additional sixteen hundred we didn't hear that from them. So unless that's changed like within the last couple of days. That's something they should of. Told you guys so out of those sixteen hundred that I know of what they were told what they told this- property owner was at the do they do not have a contract right now to test any additional homes would you be able to provide the contact information for that resident to the doctor definitely I'll ask you to- do that at the an address or to follow at the last the TSC meeting one of their their DTS the employees- did admit that they do not have a current contract in place to do. Testing on those sixteen hundred that there can't they can't get in contact with and what brings it. As a community member. If they can't handle a contract like this. They don't have the experience or the know how to how to handle. A catastrophe of this of this magnitude. And I don't send I don't trust them I don't trust them to make decisions that are in the best interest of the community. And I don't make trust them to make decisions that are in the interest of getting this cleaned up as expeditiously as as possible I would ask I would encourage a auditor to find out why they're having the problems with the contractors and it's this isn't the first time they've had problems with contractors they obviously I'm not eight they're not able to handle that. Another question regarding the contracts is. Is American integrated services. Did they ever do work both on act on the excited facility and on the residential clean up because that's also something that I'm interested because I would think that would be a conflict of interest. That's something else that I would hope that you guys would look into. So of moving on to the most important thing to me. As in the- over six having years that we've been fighting for excited. The communities health has been impacted. There's no question about that they can say there's no way to prove this. This site- these chemicals not just lead but all the other list of toxins that they came they put out. That there's no way to prove but you can. You can prove it. Everything that they put on the list of what led an arsenic and all of those. Can can because my family has suffered. I have most of them. And there's no hope for me there is no reversing the damage that it's done to me and I'm pretty sure I will not see the end of the clean up. And what I have failed to see. Is since we started this. No monies. From the state. From the TSC from anybody. Has gone to. Help with the health impacts. We are the worst casualty of this contamination yet there is no cleanup of our human bodies there's no assistance for us when the US attorney entered is inter this agreement and decided. Whether it was because they have a government contract to recycle their batteries or not I don't know why they entered into this contract but they took our ability to see- that that. The residents are ability to sue for health damages or financial assistance to pay for their chemo their doctors bills there you know the procedures that they have to go through. So we're eating the cost of this and there is no help for us what I am asking is if you guys can find in any budget. To set up a fund you can give it to the department of health that the county health department let them set up a fund to help. People pay for their healthcare costs incurred by the contamination cost. My copay to see my oncologist is thirty five dollars every time I go see them that's not including the medications it's not including the procedures it's not calling. And I have excellent insurance. And that still. Financial financially hard on me to pay for all of that. We need something to address the hit health in the human impact. The people who department of health- referring to for manta for developmental delays and disabilities in testing is regional center. Now through my at my work life I worked with the regional different regional centers for years. East LA regional that service the area that the- that covers the impacted area. Has the most. Clients being service than any other regional center anywhere else. They're referring people there and they can't even get assessed or or even or even evaluated because they don't have the money to. So money needs to either go to the organizations that are being referred to compete were they're referring people to and a fun needs to be set up. For this and the last thing I ask for funding also. You guys can find grant or funding for. Dr Jill Johnston who did the tooth fairy project. And white memorial Medical Center doctor Brian Johnston both of them are looking into. A study. With the X. Leyva X. ray fluorescence machine that will ship and measure long term exposure. Only there can a doctor truly see what you're at risk for and can understand a little bit more how it how they can treat you. We at least deserve that we at least deserves some monies going to research care and anything else that the county is incurring the cost of. Humans who were affected are going to need help for the next decade the children who were born into it now argument need helping care and services throughout their of their life not just it doesn't and the clean up is done so I'm asking that you guys take that into consideration thank you thank you for comments of step. Can steal. All right all work of read these questions so what happens when Sora was re contaminated. Ray contamination no edge has been found why and when will this move out of preliminary. Ground water was affected by hex chromium where are we with this the and PA listed at us finding. Of the excite plant. No soil has been tested since June twenty nineteen ray residences. Public dissemination of materials paid by excited will expire in twenty twenty the of the anti any non prosecution agreement what happens after five year and PA sunset. The I thank you for asking those questions this is an opportunity to provide public comment but I'm sure that departments listing and taking those questions into consideration at a Martha menace did you want to add a comment to what we've already. And please. Yeah the people that strategies okay. I don't want to give that to anyone the question that I have for the officers that deal with health related issues. If we are to do blood tests are you able to tell us if five there's lead that emanated from the- source of exercise in our neighborhoods. Yeah there's been talk about that and unfortunately for blood testing no there is there are some ways in environmental testing that you can do that sort of work to try to source the kind of lead that you finding environment to the source that it may have come from. For human testing no we don't have sophisticated tests enough that will that can do that sort of- that's the can give yes that sort of result okay. And for supervisor Hilda cities so what I want to point out that this is an opportunity for public comment it's not a Q. and a- I just wanted to make a constitutional requests on behalf of my community can I do this yes you can make any request you want. I wanted to our supervisor Hilda cities if five she may be able to increase the number of promote daughter since paas seven now that I know that the representative is here why because our community from city terrorists to. Burn in southeastern cities are impacted the most impact the communities for the environmental issues so I wanted to know if you may do that because those people can be our corporate people they can going to power the communities but reaching out. To them I know that the el county is looking into getting more promote taught us to other districts. By you represent my district and I have a lot of faith that you are doing a great job. One know if made the. For our community. So a if you choose to respond now if you interest later that's fine but this is not. The is public comment on on- intended to be a time when we have dialogue- all I see. And an observation can the US army corps of engineers service sign overseers. Of the exite our proper this mad. And the cleanup of the residential areas scenes they work in pump. Well the world thank you. Thank you very much- next we have Yvonne bike if I could just respond I know I'm a big advocate for the moment thought us and- I know the public health and mental health have actually in the last two budget cycles increase the number of from a thought as- but keep in mind that our budget comes from also the federal government Sacramento and because we've been so successful I think with the small army that we have. Other supervisors have picked up on that so I would say that in most cases unfortunately they divide by five but we do know that our our our county resources- I have always continue to be supportive of that and I think maybe working with the legislature that might be something that we could try to carve out funding for the state because they are affected their health care navigators- and they do- culturally competent. Of information and they help to encourage people to get tested for everything and they certainly could could be used for to working with the TSC- DTS I'm sorry do TSC to get out to the community because they're the ones that are most trusted- I don't know that our capacity maybe there's something that we could work with. With the state out on something like that as we head but again it a lot of allies on the budget but it's registered thank you. Thank you we have if March what the next and- lastly. Maximo qureia. Hi good evening my name is Martinez even Martinez Watson on the chair of the environmental justice committee for the Sierra Club Angeles chapter. And I just wanted to mention. There's a difference between conventional environmentalism environmental justice. Conventional my rental isn't is about see of like cannibals places. Both types of- issues environmental justice is about social justice it is about getting justice for people. And the focus is on people. And that is what's happening here we have a situation where the people are being affected by their environment. And it is really unfair for these people to be having to wait so long to get justice. Because of the social justice movement we say justice delayed is justice denied. And for the people here who have children who were five years old way back when this whole thing started. And the DTS he determined that they were going to start with the houses that were the most impact it had the highest levels of lead. Had a pregnant woman present or five year old child or any of these other conditions well we are way past that. In terms of the future. And that means that those people who were back then. At most risk. For the adverse effects of lead have had two indoor it way past the time that they were determined they needed to help the most. So that is not acceptable. Environmental justice was based on the concept of environmental racism. And in this case if this were a situation happening in another part of Los Angeles I guarantee you those people would have been all over your cases by now this would not have been allowed to continue this long. Something needs to be done for these people it needs to be done as quickly as possible. And it needs to be done for the people in addition to their properties. They need to get some sort of either compensation or some kind of assistance with the health issues that they're going to be facing because let there is no. Safe level of lead in your body none. These people are going to be dealing with the site these effects for years for the rest of their lives. They're already dealing with the now. If this had been a communicable disease such as the one that we're facing right now from the corona virus. This one tire area would have been under quarantine. And I guarantee you health department they would have gone house by house quarantine everybody. And making sure that everybody was covered there would have been no gaps. There would have been no properties well you're not as bad as your neighbor. That's ridiculous is ridiculous I heard in this week that there's a property owner who is surrounded. Buy properties that were cleaned up. But because her whole is in the next tier contamination she still waiting. How can you possibly say the her house is somehow we more immune than the house around her. What's going on. No means what the world is going to happen to all those people almost property owners who are in that next level of contamination. If we don't have enough money right now it resources to handle the people that were the most contaminated. Are we just gonna say well sorry. Yeah you're you're you're you're properties contaminated we don't have the money for it. I'm telling you this is not home. These people should be coming up here and banking you for help. Something needs to be done has something in spree done right away thank you. Thank you for your comment. Maximo correct. Haven't we given my yeah. To have a portable microphone in the back. Well we'll see. California. Nine five two four. I hope. You like the price.

Berman me comment risky. General so oppose opinion when a was as you put a juvenile shall also say that children of the bill so they're not they're not. Listening to everybody you all seem to have a really good position on wanting to help us clean the soil I get that- either one of those he loves because you're more of a concept but I have a lot of neighbor. Already the answer. It for me to hear okay. Impious Sam. Ga support crassa. Hello up of media. When was the most last time. You you need to go house house you need to check each for member and check our blood levels in C. we're doing. There's what is this all. Libyan E. instigator here is up into rather lookouts Acosta movie in the back of some low esos impediment lovers the numbers game but I'm not able to possibly so I'm I'm saying first go to the people. Then you can go to the soil and then finally take care of the paint in those issues and then we can repair those homes. And does I go to the vision committee thinking also him c<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; c&lt;/c&gt;</u> one able to around. Conocida you have a little it'll you okay but the most. Must Cooley because he won't. We're gonna so see on. My responsibility that. But up well there yeah well they're not that it's. Super yet though could get in. Okay we need more organ. This to be done in a better way it needed it should have been rolled out in it in a different way. I have many neighbors who come to me who said I'm not satisfied with the way this is been done. See if what is a list when you cook at the necessary to look at both okay Mosul the main thing. It is very necessary that we all work United together. It will be in a circle deals with the one of the system better known as political the US going like when you that. Is a necessity. I request you to that geico was that my hope. You go to all the mayor's office as a go to everybody talk to everyone but they're really not being responsive to what needs to be done and how the work needs to be. This is just an opera hometown log on and also low. But I get much I can't pay it that they like when you that. As political support this to me at least get them to put in the how about if the next time you have one of these meetings during a much bigger place. How real outrage we're community members who are going through this can actually come and stay with you their stories. But open it limited to the fullest assembly the company local like when you that needs done most. Democrats voted any settlement that could rest of total it up at the numbers went up when is it going published the project the that if the after. All these assembly men and women who. The so well and but elected in war they are. You will do back. To really. To what we are saying it. Together and work and coordinating this. Correctly to the we can clean our- unity. See if them in the US okay- up really Jacqui this is to some of the some please take a look- but I. But I guess so. But I'd low not printed on your conduct testing in though. But then I don't put as he they think of him as possible so what I'm asking the minister unless you're done you're going to focus on that the little also see that. You know although as far as to say that maybe these assembly men and women. Can goal one further. And do something about Donald Trump. And what he's doing. To respond to the issue. That we're going there right now. I in up I mean dollar con. You okay stumble so in the course of my I mean if assume. He's this and then the- only gonna. Because most of in the- lower by use. His horrible understanding of the earth warm. And climate change is really the basis for a lot of what's going on he's misunderstanding is causing. A lot of issues in my community. It will be Hogan road that is a second at the look at I'm a sucker could be the most and let the other. Thing is some of what they get yeah but but as soon but it you know.
