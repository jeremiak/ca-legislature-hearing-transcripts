AND AS I READ- THIS MEASURE

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:25.470
RICHEST. IT REQUIRES THAT A

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:27.506
NOTICE ABOUT HOW PARENTS CAN

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.374

UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BUILT

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.973
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. MANY

MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL IS

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.575

BRING THIS UP FOR THE FIRST

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:34.459
TIME NOW I KNOW WE HAD A VERY

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:36.561
BRIEF BUT- I THINK CONCISE

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.830
CONVERSATION OR COMMUNICATION-

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.733
THE LAST TIME- WE- WE HEARD

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.436

LET'S DO IT ACROSS THE BOARD

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:09.995
AND I THINK. IT IT'S IT RAISES

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:14.099
CONCERNS AND SUSPICIONS- IN.

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:16.201
MAYBE NONE OF THAT IS WARRANTED

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:19.971

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:22.007
IN THE ISM IN ON ONE PARTICULAR

00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:25.677

TRANSPARENCY SOME OF THEM. WERE

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.493

TRANSPARENCY ACROSS THE BOARD

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:43.221

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:48.293

SENATOR DOLLY. I WOULD JUST SAY

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.234
THAT THAT. THE OPPOSITE

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:57.669
ORIGINALLY TOLD ME THAT THEY

00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:59.137
HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL OR

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.538
HAVING IF THE EVERYTHING HAS TO

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:02.540
BE TRANSLATED. INTO THE

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.709
LANGUAGE OF CHOICE- WHICH I

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:05.977
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT CAN BE

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.679
TIME CONSUMING IT CAN BE AND

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.581
WILL BE. AND SO I ASK THE

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.316
AUTHOR TO TAKE THAT OUT

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.617
THINKING THAT THAT WOULD REMOVE

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:14.352
OPPOSITION. AND SO I WAS

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.687
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:17.722

LOT OF WORK WITH THEM AS WELL.

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.560
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:23.728
WAS SURPRISED THAT IT DIDN'T

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.263
REMOVE ANY OPPOSITION EITHER.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.166
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:28.700

THE AMENDMENTS. YES SO FIRST I

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:34.906
WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR

DIDN'T WORK WITH A CHAIR AND I

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.218
THOUGHT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE I

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:47.819

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.087
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. IF IT

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.756

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.444
MOST ALL PARENTS ARE. AND YOU

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.913

TO YOUR CHILDREN WHEN AND HAVE

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:17.515
WHAT IT WHAT THE ACTUAL

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.050
CURRICULUM IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.585
THINK PARENTS SHOULD BE ENGAGE

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.520
AND I THINK THAT'S- WHY THIS.

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.923
PART OF THIS- CURRICULUM HAS

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.925
BEEN PUT OUT ITS PURPOSE I'VE

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:28.626
ASKED FOR TO BE PUT UP ON THE

INTERNET BASICALLY WE ARE NOT.

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:31.963

CURRICULUM THAT HAS BEEN

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:35.200

THROUGH ALL THE MATERIAL. THAT

OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.928

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.697

DO THAT THIS BILL. OBVIOUSLY

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:46.704
THAT'S GONNA DRIVE THE COST UP

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.673

POINTS BEFORE THE VOTE. ONE IS

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:20.525
THAT THIS IS NOT THE SAME BILL

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:21.993
THAT WE HEARD BY A DIFFERENT

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.895
AUTHOR IN A PREVIOUS YEAR IF.

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:26.631
THAT BILL- WOULD HAVE REQUIRED

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.666

THAT THAT IS NOWHERE IN THIS

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:36.674
BILL. NUMBER IN THIS BILL AND

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.910
THIS BILL. HAS ELIMINATED THE

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.244
REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSLATION AS

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:41.579
WE HAVE JUST DISCUSSED THAT IS

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.481
ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:46.050
CHANGE- AND SO ALL I'VE SEEN IN

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:49.821
THIS BILL- IS IT IS IT ISSUE OF

00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:53.491
ACCESS AND IT'S A GENTLE- HOW-

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.793
THAT FOR ME- WHO IS A VERY-

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.728
PROTECTIVE OF LOCAL CONTROL THE

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:58.729
SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN MAKE THESE

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.331
CHOICES NOW AND- AND EVEN WHEN

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:01.566
YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSLATIONS

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.768
WILL. IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 15%

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:06.170
OF YOUR POPULATION- LANGUAGE

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:07.104
OTHER THAN ENGLISH YOU SHOULD

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.739
BE THINKING ABOUT TRANSLATION.

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:09.373
THAT IS PART OF THAT

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.808
RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:11.676
AND I HOPE THAT THAT WOULD

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.444
HAPPEN. I'M GLAD THAT WE DON'T

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.512
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A STATE

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.080
MANDATE WHAT WE PLAYED YOU KNOW

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:17.515

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:20.384
SENSITIVE ONE BECAUSE WE WANT

DOING IT AND EVERYTHING THAT I

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.895

APPLE WAYS WE CAN DO THAT AND

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:44.876
HERE'S THE THING. IF WE HAD

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:46.744
ANOTHER SENSITIVE SUBJECT WE

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.693
ABILITY TO WOULD MOVE FORWARD

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.096
WITH DISTRICTS I KNOW WE DID-

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:53.897
BUT IN AREAS WHERE THE

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.632
POPULATION IS JUST VERY VERY

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.768
SMALL. AND NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.837
WILLING TO ENGAGE IN CIVIC

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.638
ENGAGEMENT IT BECOMES VERY

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.807
DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT SO IN

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:04.908
PRINCIPLE I THINK IT'S A

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.944
WONDERFUL IDEA I THINK IN

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:08.512
PRACTICE IT WOULD MAKE IT VERY

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.114
VERY DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.448
COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ENACT

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.550
THAT- OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:14.752
WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.920
ENACT SUCH A MEASURE- EITHER

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:18.222
FOR WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT.

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:22.993
ON THIS MEASURE BUT I DO. TRULY

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.827
DO APPRECIATE YOUR- AND YOUR

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:26.397
EFFORT IN A AND PER THIS. I

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:28.432
THANK YOU SENATOR CHOCOLATE LET

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.300
ME MAKE CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.368
ABOUT THIS BILL THAT WOULD

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.203
COMPEL A DISTRICT TO SWITCH THE

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.105
BASIS FOR ITS ELECTIONS THIS

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.340
BILL SIMPLY COVERS A VERY

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:38.042
NARROW CARRIAGE FOR SCHOOL

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.843
DISTRICTS WHO WHO WHO'S WHO

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.412
RESIDE IN CITIES OR COUNTIES

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:42.980
THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR THAT ARE

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:44.982
GOVERNED BY A CHARTER- AND SO

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:46.450
ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IN THE

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.452
EVENT. THAT THOSE SCHOOL

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:49.086
DISTRICTS MEETING THOSE

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.755
CRITERIA SHIFT TO TRUSTEER

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:53.223
ELECTIONS IT MAKES IT EASIER

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.225
FOR THEM TO DO SO- AND SAVES

00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:57.461
THEM THE COST OF AN ELECTION

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:58.195
AND THE COSTS OF RESTRICTIVE

00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:00.631
LIMITATION TO BE VERY CLEAR WE

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:01.799
CAN HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:02.900
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA VOTING

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.601
RIGHTS ACT BUT IN THIS CASE

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.270
WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO. RENDER

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.072
CLARITY AND EFFICIENCY AROUND A

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:10.374
VERY NARROW CARRIAGE THIS WOULD

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.142
NOT APPLY TO BE A DUBBED AND IN

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.043
ALL LIKELIHOOD TO ANY THE

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.678
DISTRICT'S YOU JUST DESCRIBED.

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.380
OKAY SO THIS IS NOT A MANDATE

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:18.715
THAT YOU WOULD FORCE EVERY

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:20.384
EVERY ENTITY TO PURSUE SUCH A

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.019
MATTER ABSOLUTELY THIS IS ONLY

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:24.021
APPLIES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:26.023
ARE INTENT ON SHIFTING TO AT

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.958
LARGE TO FROM AT LARGE INTEREST

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:29.927
YEAR ELECTIONS BUT WHOSE

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:31.495
DISTRICTS ARE GOVERNED BY A

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.330
CHARTER FOR EITHER THE CITY OR

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:37.734
COUNTY- IN WHICH THEY SHOULD.

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.270
OKAY WELL I THINK THAT CHANGE

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:42.639
MY OPINION THE LADY SENATOR

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:44.141
MICHAEL. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:48.245
SENATOR DOLLY. SO I'M A LITTLE

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.080
TORN SO I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.215
TRYING TO DO AND I KNOW THE

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:52.316
ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.785
DRESS BUT WHO IT IS STATES TEN

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:56.887
WHO CHOOSES THE VALERIE'S OF

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.922
THE OF THE DISTRICT AND I THINK

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:01.525
THAT IS WHERE- THIS IS HONING

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.559
IN ON SO CAN YOU TELL ME A

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.461
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW WHO

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.530
GETS TO CHOOSE THOSE. THOSE

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:09.433
DISTRICTS TYPICALLY THE BOARD

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.235
WOULD DO THAT- AND A LOT OF

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:13.670
THAT CENTER DOLLARS WOULD.

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:15.806
DEPEND ON HOW THAT PROCESS WAS

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:18.942
EITHER INITIATED- OR OR OR

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.278
UNDERTAKEN- BUT THERE'S NOTHING

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.147
ABOUT THE BILL THAT WOULD

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.516
CHANGE THAT PROCESS- THAT FOR

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:26.517
THE MOST PART IS A LOCAL

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.952
PROCESS AND DONE THE IN

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:31.288
CONSULTATION WITH THE

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:31.955
STAKEHOLDERS. IN EVENT THE

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:33.090
SCHOOL THE DECIDE OF ITS OWN

00:46:33.157 --> 00:46:35.292
VOLITION TO THAT OR IN RESPONSE

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.960
TO A DEMAND LETTER. OF YOU KNOW

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.929
FOR CALIFORNIA RIGHT TO RIGHTS

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:40.631
SIX SHOOT. BUT IT'S IN IN THAT

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:41.765
RESPECT IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN

00:46:41.832 --> 00:46:44.268
ANY OTHER DISTRICT. SO THERE'S

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:45.502
NO ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.070
GERRYMANDER THEN THAT'S THAT'S

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:48.205
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT I

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:49.406
MEAN I'VE BEEN SOMEBODY WHO'S

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.774
BEEN ELECTED HIM INTO. COUPLE

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.544
SENSES IN TRYING TO DIVIDE UP.

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.145
SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS AND LET

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:56.013
ME TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT GETS

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:57.714
VERY POLITICAL ONE YOU CAN CARP

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:58.782
SOMEBODY OUT OR KEEP SOMEBODY

00:46:58.849 --> 00:47:00.884
AND OR- AND THAT'S THAT'S THE

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.152
POINT I WANTED YOU TO DRESS OUT

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:03.687
I DO SHOULD ENTERTAIN TYPICALLY

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.988
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IF IT

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.156
DISTRICT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:08.325
TRUST YEAR ELECTIONS. THEY

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:09.826
WOULD SURELY DID KNOW. THE

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:12.296
NEGOTIATOR WITHIN THE BOARD. TO

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.697
ENGAGE A DEMOGRAPHER WHO WOULD

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.699
THEN GUIDE THAT PROCESS YOU

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:17.067
WOULD LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.368
WOULD LOOK AT THE PERSPECTIVE

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:24.007
LINES. AND THEN THERE'D BE. IS

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:24.675
BUT PROCESS FOR COMMUNITY INPUT.

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.475
YEAH YOU KNOW AND IN THE END

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:27.578
YOU TO YOUR- IT. BUT DO YOU

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:28.912
KNOW IF IT'S- THE SAME WAY AS-

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.647
MOST OTHER. LINE REDRAWING THE

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:31.448
STATE FOR THE MOST PART IN

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.983
CALIFORNIA WE ARE FREE OF

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:36.220
GERRYMANDERING. SO THERE'S NO

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.454
SO THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY I

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:39.523
MEAN ARE WE THINK ABOUT DISS.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.591
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES INSIDE OF

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.125
A SCHOOL DISTRICT IT NEED TO BE

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:43.460
REPRESENTED ON THE ON THE

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.528
SCHOOL BOARD JUST WANNA MAKE

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.029
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.798
THE ABILITY BILL TO

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:50.968
GERRYMANDER- SENATE I'VE HEARD.

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:51.568
SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET LEFT OUT

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:52.636
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE.

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:53.971
CHANGED THAT STATEWIDE WE WE'RE

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:55.105
GOING TO RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.740
THERE'S THE CENSUS IS AND WE

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:58.175
HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A BOARD TO

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.176
TEST OUT WHICH I THINK IS VERY

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.511
HEALTHY ACTUALLY. RICHARD SO

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:02.179
YOU KNOW THAT FOR THE MOST PART

00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:04.081
IT'S EXTERNAL TO DO THIS BILL

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.749
IN ITS INTENT. SO YOU CAN THINK

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.351
ABOUT THIS BILL AS A WAY OF

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.886
ENABLING A PROCESS. THAT YOU

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:11.888
KNOW FOR THE OR THE TIMING. AB

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:12.689
YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.790
INTENDING TO DO IS MAKE SURE

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.392
THAT THAT IF AND WHEN I

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:15.993
DISTRICT DECIDES TO MAKE THIS

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.762
CHANGE- THAT THEY CAN DO SO.

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.130
WITHOUT HAVING OF A SPECIAL

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:21.865
ELECTION WHICH IS COSTLY. OR OR

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:23.133
WITHOUT BEING YOU KNOW PUTTING

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.401
THEMSELVES ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.470
A OF A PROSPECTIVE SEVERE A LOT

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:29.840
LAWSUIT. BUT BEYOND THAT YOU

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.241
KNOW THIS THIS MAKES IT DOES

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:32.676
NOT CONTEMPLATE HOW THOSE LINES

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:33.577
WOULD BE DRAWN IT WOULD BE NO

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:37.714
DIFFERENT. THAN ANY OTHER

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:39.016
JURISDICTION. INTO THE WAIVER-

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:39.650
OPPORTUNITIES SO THEY CAN WAY.

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.984
TILL THEY CAN HAVE A GENERAL

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.686
ELECTION WHICH- DRIVES THE COST

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:43.587
DOWN ISWHAT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.488
IS THAT CORRECT IT'S THE

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:46.990
OPPOSITE THAT THE WAIVER

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:47.591
OPPORTUNITY ALLOWS THEM TO NOT

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:49.726
HAVE AN ELECTION. AND JUST DO

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:50.927
THE DRAW THE DISTRICTS AN

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.429
INCORRECT BUT YOU KNOW BUT

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:53.997
BUILT TO THAT PROCESS IN SOME

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.732
WAY THAT. YOU KNOW ISSUES

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.701
AGREED UPON BY THE BY THE-

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.870
GOVERNING BODY- BUT THEY WON'T

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.238
HAVE TO THE END YOU KNOW TO THE

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:04.641
ELECTION. SO THAT'S A WHERE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.543
LIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.110
JERRY MANNING IF THAT WAS A

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.545
THAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT. WHAT'S

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:10.013
REALLY YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.382
SENATOR DOLLY AND SO. YOU KNOW

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:12.883
ONE MAN'S GERRYMANDERING

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:15.185
ANOTHER MAN'S LINES RIGHT SO WE

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:17.554
FACE THAT ISSUE EVERY TEN YEARS

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.122
RIGHT FOR YOU KNOW FOR LOCAL

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:22.092
JURISDICTIONS- AND FOR THIS YOU

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:22.926
KNOW YOU'RE MAKING A CHANGE

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.728
BUT- TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:27.731
CHANGE. IS THIS IS TO ENABLE

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.032
THE DECISION HAVING ALREADY

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.535
BEEN MADE. TO BE EXECUTED IN A

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:32.302
WAY THAT DOESN'T COST

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.637
ADDITIONAL MONEY OR UNTIL

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:35.505
ADDITIONAL TIME. BUT IT IT IT

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:38.742
DOESN'T YOU KNOW IT IT HAS NO

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:39.343
BEARING ON HOW THOSE LINES ARE

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.812
DRAWN. SO I UNDER I GET THE-

00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:42.979
OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE THE

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:44.047
RESOURCES BECAUSE IT IS VERY

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:44.981
EXPENSIVE TO DO SPECIAL LOOKS

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:47.017
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I ALSO AM

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:49.920
CONCERNED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW.

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.154
THE DRAWING THE LINES IS

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.856
CRITICAL BECAUSE IF A COMMUNITY

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:55.392
IS LEFT OUT- AND THERE'S NOT

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:59.496
SOME IT- ABILITY FOR FOLKS WHO

00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:01.498
CAN PROTEST THOSE LINES- IN

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.399
THIS IS DONE BY THE BOARD THIS

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.401
IS GIVING THEM THAT ABILITY TO

THAT TEACHERS HAVE BEEN TRYING

TO PROVIDE TUTORING SERVICE

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.455

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.276
SAY IF I ONLY HAD JUST A LITTLE

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.478

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.120
RESTRUCTURED- MY HOPE IS THAT

WE COULD SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE WE

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:22.124

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.534
TO PROVIDE THESE TUTORING

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.104
100% BUT I CAN TELL YOU AS A

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:37.973
TEACHER. WHO TAUGHT IN THE

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.512
SCHOOLS AT DISTRICT AND SYSTEM-

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:44.780
WE CAN NEVER HAPPEN THAT. WE

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:45.848
CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:46.815
TRYING TO HELP BUT YOU KNOW

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.784
AFTER HOURS AFTER SCHOOL AND

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.185
THE CHALLENGE WE'RE HAVING TO

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:52.654
IS THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW- WE

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:53.889
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS THAT

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:55.324
STILL WANT TO TAKE ON TUTORING

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.292
AFTER HOURS I MEAN THAT'S- AS A

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:58.360
TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT WAS

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.361

YOU'RE EXHAUSTED YOU'RE TIRED

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:04.533

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.267
TELL YOU'RE TRYING OUT TUTOR.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.501
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE BEFORE

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.770
SCHOOL DURING RECESS LUNCH WE

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:09.872
DON'T HAVE RESEARCH WE CAN HAVE

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.106
LUNCH. THAT WAS MY PERSONAL

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:12.374
EXPERIENCE I'M NOT SPEAKING TO

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:14.042
SPEAKING FOR ME. BECAUSE THAT'S

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:15.010
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GRAB

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.411
OPPORTUNITIES TEND TO HELP

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.347
THESE KIDS. BUT THE HOURS

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.148
DURING THE DAY ARE NEVER AND

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.017
NOT STILL I DO I GUESS THAT THE

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.352
INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS NOT

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:25.120
TO TOUCH THAT FINDING OUT ALL.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.321
THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.624
NOT TO. DISPLACE ANY TEACHER

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.692
ANY CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE ANYBODY

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:31.627
THAT'S ALREADY WORKING WITHIN

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.962
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND WHEN YOU

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:36.498
SAY HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK-

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.800
AT BOTH PROGRAMS. BOB THAT IS

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:41.270
WHY ISN'T OFTEN PROGRAM. IF A

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.038

ME. THEY DON'T HAVE TO OPT IN.

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.144
BUT I THINK IT'S UP TO EACH

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.746
INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.581

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.752
AS A TOOL THAT THEY CAN USE.

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.387
YOU KNOW I THINK IT IT'S JUST

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.655
THAT JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE

OTHERS ON A PRO BONO BASIS

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:00.007

PROGRAMS AS WELL THIS ONE. JUST

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.673
HAS TO DO PARTICULARLY WITH THE

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.475
LAW BUT WE LOOK TO SCHOOLS

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.710
WERE- IN DEMOGRAPHICALLY

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.012
CHALLENGED COMMUNITIES WHERE

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:40.481
THEIR- UNDERSERVED STUDENTS TO

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:45.919
TRY. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO GIVE

ANSWER THE QUESTION. I GUESS.

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:53.527
MOST AND I KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:56.230
BEEN A PROACTIVE- REACH FROM

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.532
THE FOUNDATION IS THERE A

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.801
POSSIBILITY THAT SCHOOLS THAT

01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:01.869
HAVE NOT BEEN REACH COULD

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:04.672
ACCESS OR COULD REACH OUT IN IN

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:05.539
CONSIDERATION OF BEING A

RIVERSIDE COUNTY RIGHT NOW AND

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.716
I WANT I CAN SPEAK TO IS THE

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:17.551
WAY THOSE SCHOOLS WERE SELECTED

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:18.819
AND THEY DID LOOK FOR SCHOOLS

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:20.321
AND- IN THE UNDERSERVED

01:39:20.387 --> 01:39:21.555
COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO REACH

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:22.823
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.291
NEVER HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THERE

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:26.260
IS ABSOLUTELY. AN OPPORTUNITY

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:28.862
TO ADD SCHOOLS AND EXPAND IN

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:29.530

THE MONEY IS TO BUILD CAPACITY.

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:37.438
