READ AN ARTICLE IN A LATEST.

APARTMENT BUILDING. AND THE

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.270
REASON THERE WAS A FIRE IS

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.172
BECAUSE THE APARTMENT COMPLEX.

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.840

ALLOWED TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.989
IS BECAUSE THE CODE ENFORCEMENT

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.058

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:11.026

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:29.845
BY THE LANDLORD OF BEING

THE STATUS OF THE TENANTS. I

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.127

BILL DOESN'T PUT ANY NEW

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.200
WHATSOEVER THIS BILL ACTUALLY

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:33.501
PUTS A RESPONSIBILITY ON

01:24:33.568 --> 01:24:34.869

THEY THINK OF TIME AS DAMAGE

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:11.973
SOMETHING BUT IT'S

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.341
INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT WE

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:14.909
HAVE CITIES VERY FEW BUT WE

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:15.910

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.651
NOTHING FOR LANDLORDS

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:24.819
WHATSOEVER IT CHANGES A

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:25.487
RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:27.388
MUNICIPALITIES AND THE FACT

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.656
THAT WE HAVE HAD CHILDREN DIE

01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:29.591
IN THE STATE AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:30.859
SHOW YOU THE ARTICLE BECAUSE

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.760
THE CITY REFUSED TO GO TO THOSE

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.062
SLUMLORDS AND HAVE THEM IN

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:35.463
FORCE AND SAID THEY TOLD THE

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.931
TENANTS BUT THEY WERE BEHIND ON

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:38.600
THE RENT AND SO IT WAS ALL UP

02:35:16.273 --> 02:35:17.107
WITH UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE THAT

02:35:17.174 --> 02:35:18.942
WELL. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE FOLKS

02:35:19.009 --> 02:35:20.210
BUILDING THAT ARE GOING TO NEED

02:35:20.277 --> 02:35:21.945
AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT WE

02:35:22.012 --> 02:35:24.882
SHOULD HAVE SOME. OF BASIC-

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:27.217
STANDARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE

02:35:27.284 --> 02:35:29.586

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:41.565
THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IN

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:44.868
TERMS OF- A PATH FORWARD. I

02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:46.470
THINK THAT IT DEFINITELY

EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN.

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:57.527
DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

BUILT- BUT WITH HORRENDOUS WORK

02:38:59.596 --> 02:39:02.866
STANDARDS AND SOUNDS A THAT-

02:39:02.933 --> 02:39:03.901

BUT THE BUILDING TRADES STOP

02:39:14.578 --> 02:39:16.780
THAT WAS REMARKABLY- EITHER

02:39:16.847 --> 02:39:18.148

02:39:21.285 --> 02:39:23.287
WHAT HAPPENS AND WE DON'T- HAVE

02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:24.388

CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND WE KNOW

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:51.408
THAT TOO MANY WAYS AND TIMES

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:53.677
WE'VE FALLEN SHORT SO WHETHER

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.779

TOO AGGRESSIVE ARE PLEASE MOVE

02:41:44.461 --> 02:41:46.063

IS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

02:41:48.031 --> 02:41:49.699
ENTIRE ASPECTS HERE AND

02:41:49.766 --> 02:41:52.069
HOUSING. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:53.470
FOR SURE IS WE'RE NOT BUILDING

02:41:53.537 --> 02:41:55.872
ENOUGH AND AS WE DON'T BUILD

02:41:55.939 --> 02:41:57.407
ENOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:41:57.474 --> 02:41:59.509
PRODUCTION WE CERTAINLY SEE

02:41:59.576 --> 02:42:02.212
THOSE PRICES INCREASE FOR EVEN

02:42:02.279 --> 02:42:05.015
THE MOST- BASIC SINGLE FAMILY

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:07.150
HOME STARTER HOMES SOMETIMES

CLOSE TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:42:10.954 --> 02:42:12.556
DOLLARS WHICH KEEPS MANY MANY

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.324
PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKET. BUT

02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:16.793
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO I SUPPORT

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:18.095
THIS BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT

02:42:18.161 --> 02:42:20.597
STARTING TO LOOK AT PRODUCTION

02:42:20.664 --> 02:42:22.332
IT'S ABOUT STARTING TO LOOK AT

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:25.001
HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD- BUT I

02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:27.404
WOULD JUST AGAIN SAY EVERYBODY

02:42:27.471 --> 02:42:29.606
HAS TO TAKE SOME STEPS HERE AND

02:42:29.673 --> 02:42:31.074
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE AT THE
