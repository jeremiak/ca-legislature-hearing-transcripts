SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT IDENTITY

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.806

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.642

IS OUR LOCAL REGIONAL TASK

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.416

STREAM PRICE. AND WHEN I CAN

00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:18.263
SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS THAT

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.532
OVER THE YEARS AS A STREET LEVEL

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.334
OR NOT IS A STREET LEVEL BUT A

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.670
LINE LEVEL PROSECUTING TANK IS

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.139
THAT WHEN I STARTED IN THE WORLD

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:29.775
OF PROSECUTING IDENTITY THEFT- I

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.376
WOULD INVEST QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:33.145
WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY.

00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:35.046
TRYING TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS ON

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:37.015
HOW TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.550
AND MISTER CHAIR YOU REALLY

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.218
NAILED IT WHEN YOU EMPHASIZE THE

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:42.888
FACT THAT NOW IN THIS DAY AND

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:45.524
AGE IT'S MORE ABOUT WHAT TO DO

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.425
AFTER YOUR IDENTITY HAS ACTUALLY

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:48.994
BEEN FISHED OUT OF THE WAY OUR

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.166
SITE FOR USE I BET I WOULD SAY

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.433
OVERWHELMINGLY. BASED ON MY

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.169
PRACTICAL AND ANECDOTAL

00:23:57.235 --> 00:23:59.905
EXPERIENCE- EVERY SINGLE

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.373
INDIVIDUAL I KNOW HAS HAD THEIR

00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:03.708
IDENTITY COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.344
OR ANOTHER. AND SO IT'S LESS

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:08.513
ABOUT PREVENTING WELL NOT NOT TO

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.416
GIVE UP HOPE. BUT IT'S MORE

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:12.250
ABOUT HOW DO WE HELP OUR

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:15.220
CITIZENS WHEN. THEY HAVE BEEN

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.755
PLUCKED FROM THE PILE IN THE

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:19.157
MIDDLE MILLIONS OF IDENTITIES

00:24:19.224 --> 00:24:20.759
THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN OR

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.762
COMPROMISED. FOR A CRIMINAL.

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.530
VIOLATE AND USED TO GET MONEY

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.465
WHICH IS OVERWHELMINGLY THE

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:30.001
ENTIRE PURPOSE BEHIND ALL FORMS

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:32.237
OF IDENTITY THEFT. WHEN I

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.773
STARTED I WAS TRADITIONALLY

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.675
PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:39.177
UNFORTUNATELY I SUFFERED FROM

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:41.313
VARIOUS ADDICTIONS STALL

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:43.582
INDIVIDUALS- MAILS OUT MAIL OUT

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:47.118
OF THEIR MAILBOXES- AND DID WHAT

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.787
WE CALLED CUTTING CHECKS AND

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.755
THINGS OF THAT NATURE. TO

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.457
ESSENTIALLY STEAL WHAT MIGHT BE

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:56.761
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS RELATED. TO

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:57.529
AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. THE

00:24:57.596 --> 00:25:00.098
CLASSIC CASE I NOW CHRIST. AND

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:03.301
BY CLASSIC I MEAN COMMENT IT IS

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:06.338
A VERY SIMILAR TO THE STUDENT

00:25:06.404 --> 00:25:08.874
LOAN FRAUD CASE THAT WE JUST-

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.542
COMPLETED A GRAND JURY ON IN

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:13.311
ORANGE COUNTY- WHEREIN VARIOUS

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:15.847
BOILER ROOMS ARE USING SOCIAL

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:19.851
ENGINEERING. TO TRICK CITIZENS

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:21.987
INTO PROVIDING THEIR PERSONAL

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:24.589
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SO THAT

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:26.324
THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR STUDENT

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:29.394
LOANS. AND MANIPULATE THOSE

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:31.596
LOANS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:34.032
EDUCATION. AND STEAL MONEY FROM

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:36.067
THE STUDENT BORROWERS TO THE

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:37.669
TUNE OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:40.472
OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS WITH

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:44.342
THE VICTIM'S DATA DAYS OF

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:46.978
SIXTEEN THOUSAND VICTIMS. THAT'S

00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:49.915
ONE VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THAT SET

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:51.616
US SEVEN CODEFENDANT CRIMINAL

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:55.086
CASE NOW ACTIVE IN IN SANTA ANA

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:57.088
YOU KNOW IN ORANGE COUNTY-

00:25:57.155 --> 00:26:01.559
WHERE- TRYING TO MANAGE THESE

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:04.129
VERY VERY COMPLEX IDENTITY THEFT

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:07.499
SCHEMES. THAT INVOLVED THOUSANDS

00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:10.101
UPON THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS WERE

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:11.870
OFTEN TIMES THE GOAL IS TO STEAL

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.939
SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY FROM A

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.308
LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S VERY

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:19.044
VERY EASY TO DO WITH OUR

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.180
INTERNET AGE WORLD. IS WHITE

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:25.917
POINTS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE-

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:28.853
RESOURCE STRAIN ON YOUR JUST

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.488
YOUR GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:32.857
TEAM AND PROSECUTORS. THERE WAS

00:26:32.924 --> 00:26:34.960
A TIME YEARS AGO WHEN I WOULD

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:37.963
CITE THE STATISTIC WHERE IN I

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:39.397
WOULD SHARE WITH INDIVIDUALS

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:43.001
THAT IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT FORTY

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:44.402
TO FIFTY MAN HOURS TO

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.604
INVESTIGATE YOUR AVERAGE

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:49.574
HOMICIDE. OKAY NOW AGAIN THERE'S

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:50.608
NO SUCH THING AS AN AVERAGE

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:53.745
HOMICIDE BUT MY POINT BEING THAT

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:57.082
AT THE TIME PUTTING TOGETHER AN

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:59.517
AVERAGE IDENTITY THEFT

00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:02.287
INVESTIGATION WAS BEING CLOCKED

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:05.557
AT TWO HUNDRED ONE FOR SEVEN

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:06.791
HOURS. SO PUTTING THOSE TWO

00:27:06.858 --> 00:27:09.394
TOGETHER AND LOOKING AT HOW THAT

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:12.230
IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.999
KIND OF STOP CRIME ON THE STREET

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:15.834
SPECIALLY WHEN IT'S RISEN TO

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.369
THIS LEVEL OF EXTREME

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:21.639
SOPHISTICATION. SHOWS THAT- YOU

LIST OF GREAT ATTACK POINTS FOR

CRIMINALS AND OTHER ADVERSARIES.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.616
A WHOPPING 81% OF CYBER SECURITY

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.451
ATTACKS ARE EXECUTED BY TAKING

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:21.586
ADVANTAGE OF WEAK OR STOLEN

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:25.123
PASSWORDS. 81% SAID ENORMOUS

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.594
NUMBER IT MEANS IT IS AN ANOMALY. WHEN A BREACH. HE HAS NOT

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:31.529
PROVIDED EXPECTED. DON'T OF

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:32.430

JUST TELL ME DATA SETS OF A- IN

NEW CREDIT CARDS OR OTHER

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:42.507
SERVICES IN WHICH GOVERNMENTS

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:43.808
LIKE CALIFORNIA USED ABOUT

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.243
APPLICANTS FOR STATE

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.811
ADMINISTERED BENEFITS PROGRAMS

SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.215
I KNOW THIS LAST AREAS GOTTEN

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:51.916
QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:52.617
CALIFORNIA PAST YEAR WITH

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:53.685
REPORTS THE TWENTY BILLION

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.353
DOLLARS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.788
TO CRIMINALS POLICE NOT POSING

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:59.224
AS CALIFORNIANS. OUTSIDE OF FOR

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.358
OTHER STORIES ON THE FLIP SIDE

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:01.759
OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN UNABLE

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:02.961
TO GET THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.263
THEY NEED AND RIGHTFULLY DESERVE

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.164
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PROVE THEY

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.266
ARE ONLINE AND IN SOME CASES THE

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:10.268
SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE ARE NOW

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:10.902
GETTING THE TEN NINETY NINE G.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.470
TAX FORMS ABOUT TAXES OBEY ON

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.671
BENEFITS OF CRIMINAL CLAIM

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:17.809
BEFORE. THEM WHICH IS JUST

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:19.143
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY. THE

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.311
SAME SERIES EVENTS. HAS BEEN

00:31:20.378 --> 00:31:21.279
REPEATED IN DOZENS OF STATES

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.213
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE PAST

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.147
FEW YEARS. AS ORGANIZED

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.182
CRIMINALS RACE TO EXPLOIT WEAK

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.117
ID VERIFICATION SYSTEMS TO STEAL

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:28.152
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO WHY DOES

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:29.554
THIS KEEP HAPPENING. WELL I

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.089
THINK A KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.290
COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND TODAY'S

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.158
THE ATTACKERS HAVE JUST. FLAT

00:31:34.225 --> 00:31:35.860
OUT CAUGHT UP WITH A LOT OF THE

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:36.661
FIRST GENERATION TOOLS WE'VE

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.496
USED TO PROTECT. AND VERIFY AND

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.231
AUTHENTICATE IDENTITY. SO

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:41.332
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:42.767
THIS AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:44.235
BLAME TO ALLOCATE BUT THE MOST

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:45.203
IMPORTANT QUESTION IS. WHAT

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.171
SHOULD GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:49.274
DO ABOUT IT NOW. THAT'S A KEY

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.708
POINT TO GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:52.410
IF THERE'S ONE MESSAGE I'D LIKE

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:53.378
THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY FROM

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:55.280
TODAY'S HEARING. IS THAT

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:56.180
INDUSTRY IS SAYING THEY CAN'T

00:31:56.247 --> 00:31:57.548
SOLVE THIS ALONE. AWARDED

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:58.950
JUNCTURE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS

00:31:59.017 --> 00:31:59.851
GOING TO NEED TO STEP UP AND

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:01.386
PLAY A BIGGER ROLE. TO HELP

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.054
ADDRESS CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:03.855
IN OUR DIGITAL IDENTITIES

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:06.190
FABRIC. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO

00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:07.125
BETTER IDENTITY COALITION

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:08.459
PUBLISHED WILL BE CALLED OUR

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:09.160
POLICY BLUEPRINTS WHICH

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:10.628
OUTLINED. A SET OF KEY

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:11.596
INITIATIVES THE GOVERNMENT

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:12.397
SHOULD LAUNCH TO IMPROVE

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:13.531
IDENTITY THAT ARE BOTH

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:15.366
MEANINGFUL IMPACT AND- WE THINK

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.535
PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTS. NOW THIS

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.203
ISN'T ABOUT A NATIONAL ID WE'RE

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:19.771
NOT RECOMMENDING THE ONE BE

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.906
CREATED. OUR THESIS IS REALLY

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.074
THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.075
NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.310
AUTHORITATIVE GOVERNMENTS AND

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:26.944
IDENTITY SYSTEMS ALREADY TODAY.

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:28.746
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE A BIRTH

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:29.514
CERTIFICATE OR PASSPORT THE

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.549
SSNS. ARE CHALLENGERS WHAT I

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.584
CALL THE IDENTITY GAP. WHICH IS

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:34.952
ALL THE SYSTEMS ARE STUCK OVER

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:39.157
THE PAPER WORLD WHILE. COMMERCE

00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:39.924
IS INCREASINGLY MOVING ONLINE.

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:44.762
SO TO FIX THIS AMERICA'S. BASE.

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:46.698
ASK AN AGENCY. THAT ALREADY

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.199
ISSUED THEM A CREDENTIAL TO

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.400
STAND BEHIND IT IN THE ONLINE

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.902
WORLD BY VALIDATING THE

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:51.402
INFORMATION FROM THAT

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:53.237
CREDENTIAL. HERE'S WHERE STATES

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.806
LIKE CALIFORNIA CAN PLAY A ROLE.

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.040
BY SHIFTING FROM ISSUING

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.709
DRIVER'S LICENSES AND STATE ID

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.110
EAST THAT ARE JUST PLASTIC

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:01.212
CARDS. BUT ALSO DOUBLE AS ROBUST

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.313
DIGITAL CREDENTIALS SAY BY

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.414
LETTING CONSUMERS CHOOSE TO

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:04.916
STORE DIGITAL VERSION OF THEIR

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.718
DRIVER'S LICENSE OR SMART PHONE.

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.219
WE FUNDED THE VERY FIRST PILOTS

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.153
OF THESE NEW MOBILE DRIVER'S

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.254
LICENSES BACK WHEN I WAS A

00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.056
FINISHED IN TWENTY TWELVE. TODAY

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:12.957
A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE EMBRACED

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.792
HIM AS THE BEST WAY TO EXTEND

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.594
THE TRUST MODEL OF THE STATE

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:17.595
DRIVER'S LICENSE TO THE ONLINE

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:18.629
WORLD. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.731
ENTITY IN THE STATE OF

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.332
CALIFORNIA IN MY VIEW PUBLIC OR

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:23.101
PRIVATE THAT'S BETTER SUITED TO

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:23.735
HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:26.371
DMV. IF CALIFORNIA HAD A MOBILE

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:27.572
DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM IN

00:33:27.638 --> 00:33:28.406
PLACE AT THE START OF A

00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.174
PANDEMIC. STATE OFFICIALS COULD

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:31.342
LEVERAGE THE MILLIONS OF STATE

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:33.077
BACKED IDENTITY PROOFING PROCESS

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.679
THESE. CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.481
GONE THROUGH THIS DMV OFFICES TO

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:39.951
VALIDATE. THE IDENTITIES OF

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:41.252
APPLICANTS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT. NOW

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:41.853
TO BE CLEAR THAT MEANS MOST

00:33:41.919 --> 00:33:43.221
APPLICANTS ARE NOT ALL. THE

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.222
DRIVER'S LICENSE MIGHT BE THE

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.656
MOST COMMONLY HELD EXPOSURE-

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:46.791
HIGH ASSURANCE IDENTITY

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.359
CREDENTIAL IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.394
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ADULTS IN

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.095
THE STATES YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:51.829
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THERE'S

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:52.797
GONNA BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.399
WANT TO STATE ISSUED APP ON A

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.933
SMARTPHONE OR ONE ON A

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.868
SMARTPHONE. SO MOBILE DRIVER'S

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.369
LICENSE CAN BE PART OF THE

00:33:58.436 --> 00:33:59.470
SOLUTION IT CAN'T BE THE ONLY

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.405
SOLUTION OTHERWISE SHOULD BE

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:02.974
EXCLUDING A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.674
ACCESS TO SERVICES. SHOWS A

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:04.675
STARTING POINT I THINK IT'S THE

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.978
MOST LOGICAL PLACE FOR

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.446
CALIFORNIA FOCUS. ALSO HELP TO

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.981
SHIFT US BEYOND OUTDATED SYSTEMS

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:11.582
THAT REMIND IDENTIFIERS LIKE THE

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:12.650
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WHICH

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:13.985
HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. SO

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.253
FREQUENTLY THAT THEY NO LONGER

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.054
HAVE ANY SECURITY VALUE AT ALL.

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:18.423
THE IDEA THAT SIMPLY KNOWING

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:21.058
SOMEBODY'S SSN IS EVIDENCE THAT

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:21.959
YOU ARE THAT PERSON IS WILDLY

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.095
UPDATE. THE REALITY IS MOST SSNS

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:25.730
HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED IN ONE OR

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:26.764
MORE DATA BREACHES OVER THE LAST

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:28.533
TEN YEARS. SO BOTH INDUSTRY AND

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.134
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE BUILDING

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:32.403
SYSTEMS. THAT ASSUME. SHOULD NOT

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.404
BE THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT ASSUME

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.373
THAT SYSTEMS ARE SECRET. OR HAVE

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.374
ANY SECURITY VALUE BECAUSE TODAY

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.842
THEY DON'T. KNOW THAT DOESN'T

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.010
MEAN THAT THE SS AND DOESN'T

00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.445
HAVE ANY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:41.679
AND IDENTITY. AT THE END OF THE

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.915
DAY I DIE AS THE ASSISTANT AS AN

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:44.649
IDENTIFIER AWAY FOR EXAMPLE TO

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:46.217
HELP SOMEONE DETERMINED IF.

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.452
SOMEBODY NAMED JEREMY GRANT IS

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.020
APPLYING FOR AN ACCOUNT. AND

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.221
THERE'S MAYBE THREE HUNDRED

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:51.189
GERMAN GRANTS THAT THEY CAN SEE

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:52.890
IN THE SYSTEM WELL. WHICH JEREMY

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:56.961
GRANTED SEE ONLY ONE. HOPEFULLY

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.463
AS MY ASSISTANT. I DON'T NEED TO

00:34:58.529 --> 00:34:59.564
BE SECRET THE FACT OTHER

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.432
COMMONLY USED IDENTIFIERS LIKE

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.166
PHONE NUMBERS AND EMAIL

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:03.534
ADDRESSES ARE NOT. BUT WE

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:04.869
SOMEHOW BECOME FIXATED AS A

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:06.270
COUNTRY AND THE CONCEPT OF THE

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:07.405
ASSISTANT CAN AND SHOULD BE A

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:09.273
SECRET. AND CONTINUE TO FOCUS

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.008
OUR SEASON SECURITY EFFORTS.

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.143
AROUND WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.911
BECOMING OUTDATED CONCEPT.

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:15.146
RATHER THAN FOCUS ON NEWER

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.280
INITIATIVES THAT MIGHT BETTER

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:17.782
PROTECT AMERICANS IN THE

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:18.583
SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF THEIR

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.618
DATA. SO WITH ALL THIS IN MIND

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.452
I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.286

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.379
SCALE OF THE PROBLEM- YOU KNOW

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:23.881
WE HAVE- WE DO HAVE SOME

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:27.351
ANECDOTES HERE AROUND- THE SCALE

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:29.186
OF IDENTITY THEFT AND IDENTITY

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:31.322
FRAUD- YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM

MISTER GRANT THAT HE THINKS AT

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.191
THIS POINT MOST PEOPLE HAD THEIR

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:36.193

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:43.634
YOU A SENSE OF. HOW BIG A

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:44.735
PROBLEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:48.205
THIS POINT. WELL I WOULD YIELD

CHRISTMAS- WHO MAY HAVE CLOSER

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:53.578
FAMILIARITY WITH THOSE NUMBERS

00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:58.549
AND WE DO- YES WE DO HAVE DATA

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.785
ON PARTICULARLY ON DATA BREACHES

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.887
THE I. TERZI HAS BEEN CAPTURING

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:05.289
A PUBLICLY REPORTED. INCIDENTS

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.358
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND WE

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:10.328
DO ISSUE A REPORT ON THAT- WE

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:12.163
CAPTURE THE NUMBER NOT ONLY OF

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:14.098
INCIDENTS THERE WERE ONE

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:15.166
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:17.702
TWO BACK IN- LAST YEAR. A BUT WE

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:18.970
ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:20.938
VICTIMS NOT THE NUMBER OF

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:22.707
RECORDS THOSE ARE IN THE

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.408
TRILLIONS BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.409
OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.945
IMPACTED I CAN LOOK THAT NUMBER

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:29.614
UP I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.749
ME AT THE MOMENT BUT IT HAS BEEN

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:34.418
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS HUNDREDS

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:37.688
OF MILLIONS OF VICTIMS SINCE.

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.623
TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE STATEMENT

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.891
THAT ALL OF OUR INFORMATION IS

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.693
ALREADY COMPROMISED PARTICULARLY

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.528
OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:46.597
BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE'VE

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:47.531
SEEN WE WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:51.369
THAT- THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.937
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS HAVE NOT

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:54.338
YET BEEN COMPROMISED IN THIS

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.272
COUNTRY ARE THE ONES THAT

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:56.874
HAVEN'T BEEN. ISSUED THOSE

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.378
NUMBERS YET. AND IN FACT. WE ARE

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:02.346
SEEING THIEVES USE ODD NUMBERS

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.915
THAT THEY'VE JUST MADE UP. AND

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.150
THESE NUMBERS ARE ALREADY

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:09.387
TAINTED WHEN THEY ARE ISSUED SO.

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:12.223
MY RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE YES

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.557
WE HAVE THE DATA I'M HAPPY TO

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.526
PROVIDE THAT REPORT. AND THE

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:18.529
SCALE OF IT IS ON TENABLE RIGHT

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:22.366
NOW THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:23.834
ALL OF OUR DATA AT LEAST A

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:26.237
CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL IDENTITY

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.705
DATA AND THEY THEN THE P. I. R.

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.607
THAT'S NECESSARY TO PERPETRATE

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.409
IDENTITY CRIMES HAS LARGELY BEEN

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:34.078
COMPROMISED IN PREVIOUS DATA

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.414
BREACHES. THANK YOU MISS WEST

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.381
COAST AND I GUESS AS A FOLLOW UP

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.718
TO THAT- HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.153
DOMESTIC SORT OF LIKE PETTY

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.654
CRIMINALS AND I THINK FROM SOME

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.289
OF YOUR TESTIMONIES. WE HEARD

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.590
THAT A LOT OF THIS IS LOW

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:47.625
HANGING FRUIT IT'S LIKE LOW

00:38:47.692 --> 00:38:49.627
LEVEL IDENTITY THEFT IDENTITY

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:52.096
FRAUD- BUT WE ALSO HEARD

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:54.231
ANECDOTALLY AND SEEN REPORTS OF

00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:55.833
A MAJOR DATA BREACHES COMING

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.935
FROM FOREIGN HACKERS. AND TRY TO

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.303
GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S THE SCALE

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.538
AND THEN AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:02.339
IS THAT- YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.141
JUST STARTED TO IMPOSE SOME

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.377
RATHER CRIPPLING SANCTIONS ON.

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.345
RUSSIA AND I THINK AT THIS POINT

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.580
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EVIDENCE THAT

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:10.848
THE AMOUNT OF RUSSIAN HACKER

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.883
ACTIVITY HAS HAS DROPPED PRETTY

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:13.918
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST COUPLE

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:16.087
DAYS. DO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.855
HAVE ANY IMPACT ON HACKING

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:19.390
COPPERHEADS GIVING FOREIGN

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.258
ADVERSARIES MORE YOU KNOW

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.426
AMBITION TO TRY TO GO AFTER U.

00:39:22.493 --> 00:39:23.794
S. CONSUMERS. ARE PERHAPS LESS

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.429
RESOURCES AND ABILITY TO ACCESS

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:27.898
US CONSUMERS TO HAVE A SENSE OF

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:28.699
A SUSPECT THIS WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.901
RIGHT NOW. WITH THE GLOBAL

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:33.270
STAGES CAN IMPACT IDENTITY THEFT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:36.907
IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM HERE IN

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:37.742
THE UNITED STATES. MR CHAIRMAN

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:38.609
LET ME TRY AND THAT A COUPLE OF

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.945
WAYS IF I MAY FIRST- I DON'T

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:43.247
HAVE A LOT OF. DATA THAT WOULD

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.416
SUPPORT PERCENTAGES OF WHO'S

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.718
DOING THE ATTACKING PROVIDE. I

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:48.519
THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.788
POINTS. THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.457
THE COMMITTEE TO KNOW FIRST. IS

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.359
THAT IDENTITY THEFT AND CYBER

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:58.062
SECURITY INTRUSIONS. COME FROM A

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.131
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES ON.

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:01.799
THE BIGGEST AND GRANDEST SCALE

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.200
THEY ARE COMING FROM STATE

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.202
ACTORS LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA AND

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.204
NORTH KOREA FOR EXAMPLE. AND

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.774
THAT MAKES IT PARTICULARLY HARD

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.709
TO LOCATE AN ADDRESS BUT IT'S

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:14.311
IMPORTANT THAT AND IT HAS TO

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:15.446
HAPPEN AND IT DOES. BUT WE'VE

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:18.082
ALSO SEEN THAT MANY BUSINESSES

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.084
ARE AT RISK FOR IT INSIDERS

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.552
AFTER IN FACT THERE'S BEEN DATA

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:22.820
THAT I'VE SEEN RECENTLY THAT

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.588
SHOWS SMALL BUSINESSES. IN

00:40:24.655 --> 00:40:26.023
PARTICULAR ARE PARTICULARLY

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.092
VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.461
NECESSARILY INVEST. ALL OF THE

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.329
SECURITY THAT'S NEEDED AND ON

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.031
TOP OF THAT EVEN IF THEY DID.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.633
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INSIDERS

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.301
HAVE COMING THAT COMES AS A

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:40.271
RESULT. OF MANY PERPETRATORS OF

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:41.972
IDENTITY THEFT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:43.741
FOR EXAMPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.242
IN THAT WORK PLACE WHICH IS WHY

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:47.144
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHECK THE

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.479
CREDENTIALS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.147
WORKING. IN THOSE KINDS OF

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:51.882
PLACES YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER IT

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:55.286
SYSTEMS PAYROLL HR- AND THINGS

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:58.355
LIKE THAT- SO. THAT MAYBE THAT

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:00.324
HELPS A LITTLE BIT- MISTER CHAIR

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.726
UNDERSTAND THE FRAME OF THIS

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.929
DEBATE. THANK YOU MISS LASKO

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:09.600
STEVEN CUMMINS. I WOULD ONLY ADD

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:14.705
TO THAT BUT RANSOMWARE AND THE

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.674
SAND THESE THESE TYPES OF CYBER

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.875
THREATS HAVE BEEN INCREASING

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.910
PRIOR TO THE CONFLICT THAT WHERE

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:22.680
IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND WE

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:23.747
HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.716
THIS IS MAGICALLY GOING TO

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:29.386
DECREASE WE WERE ON THE TREND.

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:30.821
TO CONTINUE TO SEE THE INCREASE

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:33.691
IN THE TARGET RIGHT NOW IS NOT

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:36.393
ACTUALLY A LARGE SWATHS OF

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.196
CONSUMER DATA IF THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.764
TARGETING BUSINESSES SMALL

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.833
BUSINESSES BUT IT'S REALLY TO

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.235
GET A REFRESH OF THAT DATA AT

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.036
THE STATIC DATA THAT IS

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.605
NECESSARY TO PERPETRATE A LOT OF

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.273
THESE CRIMES IT'S ALREADY OUT

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.075
THERE AND AS WE ADD NEW

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:55.446
MECHANISMS. TO DETECT THAT FRAUD

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.448
AND DETERMINED THAT FRAUD THEN

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:58.716
THOSE THREAT ACTORS NEED THAT

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.451
ADDITIONAL DATA I THINK THE BEST

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:03.153
EXAMPLE THAT I CAN GIVE IS AT

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.421
THAT DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:07.391
UNEMPLOYMENT. IDENTITY THEFT

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.994
ISSUES BACK IN- LATE LAST EARLY

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.263
LAST YEAR LATE TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.365
WHEN THE STATE'S ADDED

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.933
ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.835
PROCESSES THAT REQUIRE DRIVER'S

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.137
LICENSE INFORMATION WE SWEET

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:23.274
IMMEDIATELY SAW A SHIFT. WITH

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.175
THE THREAT ACTORS GOING AFTER

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:26.777
AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:28.479
WHO HAS THAT DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.681
INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:33.217
AND WHO MAY NOT HAVE. THE CYBER

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.752
SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP

00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:36.353
THOSE INTRUSIONS OUT WELL THEY

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.956
WENT AFTER AUTO INSURERS AND

00:42:39.023 --> 00:42:41.558
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND GEICO WHO

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.560
DID SUFFER A DATA BREACH EVEN

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.429
PUT ON THEIR NOTIFICATION

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.031
WARNING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.465
THEIR INFORMATION COMPROMISED

00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:49.833
THAT THEY BELIEVED. THEIR

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.235
SYSTEMS WERE COMPROMISED AND

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.404
THAT DATA WAS TAKEN IN ORDER TO

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.806
COMMIT- UNEMPLOYMENT IDENTITY

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:59.410
THEFT AND FRAUD. SO AS WE NEED

00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:01.645
TO KEEP IN MIND THAT AS WE ADD

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.414
THESE ADDITIONAL FRAMEWORKS THAT

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.649
THE THIEVES ARE A CRAFTY LOT WHO

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.318
ARE STAYING ON TOP OF THESE

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:08.419
THINGS THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:11.522
TO TRY TO GET THE DATA THAT'S

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:12.423
NECESSARY TO THWART THOSE. AND

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:13.657
IF I MAY ONE MORE THING MISTER

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.526
CHAIR- THIS WILL ASK AS MAKES A

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.594
VERY IMPORTANT POINT AS WELL AND

AS DID MR GRANT JUST A FEW

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:20.664
MOMENTS AGO. THERE IS THIS

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:22.833
ONGOING PERPETUAL CAT AND MOUSE

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.368
GAME BETWEEN THE GOOD GUYS AND

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:26.670
THE BAD GUYS AND MISTER GRANT

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:29.239
MADE A COMMENT- THAT. A LOT OF

00:43:29.306 --> 00:43:30.274
IDENTITY THEFT THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.875
NOW IS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.011
THE THIEVES HAVE CAUGHT UP TO

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:34.945
THE TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE'S THIS

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.348
CONSTANT EVOLUTION THAT AS SOON.

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.550
AS I GET ANY THIEVES FIGURE OUT

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.785
A WAY AROUND OVERTHREW

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.821
BUSINESSES HAVE TO BUILD UP THAT

00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:45.689
WALL BETTER BIGGER DIFFERENTLY.

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:47.458
AND THEN THE THIEVES TRY TO FIND

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:49.860
A WAY IN OVER THROUGH AROUND AND

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.395
IT'S- AND IT'S A NEVER ENDING

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:53.497
CYCLE BUT IT DIED THAT'S JUST

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.199
REALLY THE NATURE OF THE OF THE

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:56.633
PROCESS THANK YOU IN THIS

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.768
DISCUSSION FITS NICELY IN MY

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.636

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.151
AMOUNT OF YOUR PERSONAL

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.586
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. AND

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.655

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.731
CALL IN THE CRIMINALS. ARE

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.100
PRACTICED PROFILE ON YELP. AND

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.802

NUMBER. ACTUALLY THE DARK LAB-

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.641
PUBLIC SEARCHES THAT I WOULD PAY

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.477
A SMALL. FEE TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.579

DOCUMENTS. TITLED THAT IS JUST

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:19.583
CRAZY RAMPANT THESE DAYS- AND I

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.051
WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A-

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:26.190

TYPES OF CRIMES OR BEING

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:37.801
CAPTURED BY THE DATA. I THINK

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:40.370
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.973
BEHIND MY COMPUTER WITH A VERY

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.174
SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

PERPETRATE. THESE TYPES OF

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.817
CRIMES. IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:56.053
OF TIME SO IT'S JUST KIND OF. A

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.021
WAY TO THINK ABOUT. OUR

00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:00.090
VULNERABILITY INSTEAD OF JUST

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:01.492
KIND OF THE NUMBERS OF WHO'S

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:06.730
ACTUALLY. BEEN EXPOSED AND THEN

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:07.598
JUST ONE OTHER READ COMMENTS

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.666
ABOUT THE INNER. ISSUE INCURRED

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:13.137
. I OUR CITIZENRY OUR PERSONALLY

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:15.372
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS A

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.008
COMMODITY ON THE WORLD MARKET.

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:21.745
IT IS OUR GUY AS INDIVIDUALS A

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.747
PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

THOSE THINGS MY MEDICAL RECORDS.

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:39.763
ZACH IS A MASSIVE COMMODITY. ON

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.466
THE GRAY MARKET. AND WHAT I MEAN

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:45.035
BY THAT IS RIGHT THIS VERY

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:48.539
MOMENT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING

00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:51.608
PACKAGED AND RESOLD. AND DUMPS

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:52.809
SOMETIMES WHAT WE MIGHT CALL A

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:54.611
DATA DUMP OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:57.915
THAT. AND SO THE VERY INSIDIOUS

00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:00.617
NATURE OF THE- KIND OF

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:03.253
OMNIPRESENCE THEFT OF OUR

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.155

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.718
THAT WE SAW. I GET ATTACKED

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.420
ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHETHER THAT

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.389
NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO SOMEBODY

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.523
LIKE DEPARTMENT HOMELAND

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.924
SECURITY CYBERSECURITY AND

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:57.127
INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY.

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:57.927
BECAUSE IT HAS A CRITICAL

00:54:57.994 --> 00:55:00.063
INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT ON TOP

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.966
OF JUST DATA BEING STOLEN- BUT-

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:04.067
I WILL SAY A DATA BREACH

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.168
NOTIFICATION IS NOT AN AREA

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:06.703
WHERE I AM I AM. I HAVE DEEP

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.204
EXPERTISE BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.572
THAT CALIFORNIA OTHER STATES

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.508
ALREADY HAVE LAWS TODAY THAT ARE

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.943
ARE COVERING- THOSE SORTS OF

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.080
INCIDENCES SO WHAT DO WE HAVE A

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:17.914
RULE ON RANSOMWARE. WELL I WAS

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:19.382
GOING TO ASK IF WE MIGHT REFER

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.051
THAT QUESTION TO DEPUTY ATTORNEY

00:55:21.117 --> 00:55:24.220
GENERAL LAWSON WHO MIGHT BE WELL

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:28.258
POSITIONED ANSWER. I'M WITH WE

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.759
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING ABOUT

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:32.195
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT NOTIFICATION

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:34.397
REGARDING RANSOMWARE SCENARIOS

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:36.199
WHICH I NOW HAVE BECOME YOU KNOW

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:39.969
OBVIOUSLY VERY SIGNIFICANT- WE

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:41.671
DO AND HAVE A LONG STANDING

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:43.606
REPORTING LIVE AS SIMILAR TO

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.442
WHAT MISTER GRANT MENTIONS THAT

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:47.210
MANY STATES ACTUALLY MODELED

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:49.479
AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:55:49.546 --> 00:55:51.981
AND- AT MOST- AS FAR AS I AM

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:54.117
AWARE THAT MOST BUSINESS WITHIN

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.418
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WELL

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:57.087
AWARE OF IT AND TO COMPLY WITH

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:59.823
THOSE REPORTING- LIES IN TERMS

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.825
OF NOTIFYING. YOU FRY GOT NOTICE

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:03.460
CHECK NOTIFICATIONS YOURSELF WE

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.428
GET ON SO OFTEN THAT OFTEN TIMES

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:07.997
WE DON'T EVEN PAY ATTENTION WHEN

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.566
YOU GET A NEW CREDIT CARD IN THE

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.333
MAIL AND THEY TELL YOU TO THROW

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.869
OUT YOUR OLD ONE HI BUT I DON'T

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.871
BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE-

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.940
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:21.578
RANSOMWARE. THANK YOU AND I SEE

00:56:21.644 --> 00:56:22.545
MISS ALASKA'S HAS HER HAND UP.

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:24.214
OF I CAN CONFIRM THAT WE DO NOT

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.683
HAVE A SPECIFIC LAW RELATED TO

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.384
RANSOMWARE WE DO HAVE IN

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.786
CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE OUR DATA

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:32.422
BREACH NOTIFICATION LAW AND- I

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:34.257
THINK EVERYONE. LISTENING SHOULD

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.492
PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:36.793
BECAUSE IT WAS CALIFORNIA THAT

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.361
STARTED THE TREND IN TWO

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.763
THOUSAND FOUR THEY PASSED THE-

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:41.030
MAYBE WAS TWO THOUSAND THREE

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:42.332
WHEN IT WAS PASSED BUT IT WENT

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.666
INTO EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.335
IN THE I. T. R. C. SUBSEQUENTLY

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.503
STARTED CAPTURING THIS REPORTED

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:49.038
DATA TWO THOUSAND FIVE. I WOULD

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:51.207
ENCOURAGE US TO THINK ABOUT THE

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:52.942
NOTIFICATION LAWS EVEN THOUGH

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:55.411
THEY EXIST IN ALL OF THE STATES.

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:56.679
I CAN'T SAY THAT OUR RESEARCH

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:59.015
HAS SHOWN US THAT MANY OF THE

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:03.153
NOTIFICATIONS. OUR I DON'T WANT

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:05.522
TO SAY LARGELY MEANING LESS BUT

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:07.290
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:08.658
IN THE NOTIFICATIONS TO MAKE

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:10.393
THEM MEANINGFUL ENOUGH TO THE

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.395
PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED AND

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:14.564
JUST THINGS LIKE SPECIFICALLY

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.766
LISTING WHAT SPECIFIC DATA WAS

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:19.469
COMPROMISED- COULD ACTUALLY BE

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.905
VERY HELPFUL SO SOME OF THESE

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.773
NOTIFICATIONS THAT ARE SENT OUT

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.408
WILL SAY SOMETHING A BREACH HAS

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:28.478
OCCURRED BUT THEY GIVE. UP VERY

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:30.146
LITTLE GRANULAR DATA AND-

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:31.815
FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:35.952
COMPROMISED SO IT WE COULD ALSO

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:39.055
PERHAPS FOCUS ON- BEEFING UP AND

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.424
END UP MAKING THOSE THE

00:57:41.491 --> 00:57:44.661
REQUIREMENTS FOR NOTIFICATION OF

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.029
MORE MEANINGFUL AND MORE

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:48.198
TRANSPARENT AND I THINK THAT

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:50.733
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE-

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.734
END THE VICTIMS THAT ARE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.837
AFFECTED. THANK YOU ESPECIALLY

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.206
ON THE RANSOMWARE AKAM INTERIM I

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.208
DID HAVE A CONSTITUENT THAT-

00:57:58.274 --> 00:57:59.709
WENT THROUGH A PROCESS LIKE

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.744
THIS. AND IT BECAME COST OF

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:03.680
DOING BUSINESS CALCULATION ON

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:06.616
WHETHER THEY JUST SIMPLY PAID-

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:09.219
BUT THEY DID NOTIFY THE FBI AND

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:11.921
GIVEN THE STRUCTURE VOLUME OF

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:14.123
HOW THESE ARE BEING CONDUCTED.

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.592
EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY SINGLE

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:19.996
HOUR THERE'S SIMPLY- OVERWHELMED

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.665
AND IF YOU I THINK WE ALSO

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:25.401
ENCOUNTER- A DEGREE OF

00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:26.970
DISCRETION THAT CERTAIN

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:30.340
BUSINESSES WANT TO BE DISCREET-

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.642
ABOUT THE DISCLOSURE OF WHAT

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:35.011
OCCURRED. AND THE FACT THAT THEY

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:37.046
PAID OUT AND I HAD HEARD

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:40.750
SOMEBODY MENTION WHETHER OR NOT.

00:58:40.817 --> 00:58:42.385
THERE WOULD BE LEGISLATION

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.787
CONTEMPLATED. CORLEY'S POLICY

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.623
CONSIDERED TO BE CONTEMPLATED

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:49.826
THAT WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:52.929
PAY A RANSOM- AND I KNOW THAT

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.231
GETS INTO A WHOLE. HORNET'S NEST

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:57.433
OF LEGAL ISSUES- DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.902
THOUGHTS ALL IN ALL CONCLUDE

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:00.570
HERE GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:09.679
UTILITY. OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M ASSUMING THAT IS THAT

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:12.582
DIRECTED TO ME YES IT IS- I

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:13.850
THINK THE DEVIL WOULD BE IN THE

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:15.084
DETAILS IN THAT IN THAT

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.653
SITUATION BECAUSE THERE COULD BE

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.087
A NUMBER OF UNINTENDED

00:59:18.154 --> 00:59:21.157
CONSEQUENCES. AND SO WHILE

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.927
TRANSPARENCY WHEN INDIVIDUALS

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:26.296
ARE IMPACTED AND THEIR DATA IS

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:29.065
COMPROMISED IS- NOT AN ISSUE

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:30.700
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND WE

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:31.701
NEED TO CONTINUE IN THAT

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:35.672
DIRECTION- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:39.776
AT THE RANSOMWARE. PROCESSES

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.611
THERE IT IT HAS BECOME A

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.613
CALCULATED BUSINESS DECISION

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.515
AND- THE I.TERROR SEASON

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:47.283
ORGANIZATION CURRENTLY HAS NOT

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.685
TAKEN AN OFFICIAL STANCE ON

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:51.554
WHETHER RETAIL. ADVISED

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.456
BUSINESSES TO EITHER PAY OR NOT

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.224
PAY THE RANSOM AT THIS POINT IT

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.926
IS AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS

00:59:56.993 --> 01:00:00.930
DECISION. AND THUS FAR WHAT

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:03.666
WE'VE SEEN. IS THAT THE THREAT

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:09.105
ACTORS. IT'S OUR- HISTORICALLY

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:10.807
THEY HAVE BEEN HONORING THE CODE

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.375
AND SO WHEN THE RANSOM IS PAID

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.043
THEY ARE NOT RELEASING THE DATA

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.545
WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE A FEW OF

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.647
THE BAD ACTORS WHO ARE GOING

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.916
AHEAD EVEN WHEN THE RANSOM IS

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:22.151
PAID THEY'RE RELEASING THE DATA

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.821
SO. THE ENTIRE. BUSINESS MODEL

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.923
AND I USE THAT TERM LOOSELY. IT

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.525
COULD COLLAPSE AS AS THE THIEVES

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.327
ACT WITHOUT HONOR AND START

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.430
RELEASING THE DATA ANYWAY- BUT

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:35.531
WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE AN

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.567
OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE UTILITY

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:39.936
OF. MAKING THAT. NOT PAYING A

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:43.106
RANSOM OUR REQUIRE- LET JUST A

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:48.811
REQUIREMENT OR LEGISLATING THAT. THANK YOU A CENTER BORDERS-

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.213
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE EXPRESSED

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:51.714
INTEREST IN THOSE SO SELECTED

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.582
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IN THE

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:59.489
PAST AND- IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- WORKING ON

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.691
TOGETHER SO. AT THIS ISSUE IN

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:03.393
SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS. OF

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:04.527
CINDERELLA GIVEN QUESTIONS YEAH

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:06.963
I DIDN'T. KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.064
THINK YOU HAVING A DIFFERENT

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:08.898
CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE SPEAKING

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.867

A- OF SOME LAWS THAT ARE ON THE

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.313
BOOKS. WERE BEING CONSIDERED IN

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.082
OTHER STATES. THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:27.817
KNOW ABOUT AND CONSIDER AS WE'RE

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.652
TRYING TO THINK OF WAYS TO.

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.220
ADDRESS THE VERY REAL ISSUES AND

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:34.257
VERY FRIGHTENING ISSUES EVEN

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:35.291
RAISING TODAY AND IN TODAY'S

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:43.533
HEARING. I THINK ERIC MAYBE

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.802
TRYING TO TALK WITH THEM YET BUT

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.237
- WE ARE EXCELLENT. MY KIDS

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:50.273
ALWAYS SAY I SOUND BETTER ON

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.708
MUTE- A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:55.011
THOUGHTS- SENATOR THANK YOU FOR

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:58.114
THE QUESTION- THERE'S A NUMBER

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.383
OF. STATUTES AND RULES THAT I

PRESENTATION THAT ARE IN PLACE

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.687
THAT I THINK ARE REALLY HELPFUL

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:07.090
FOR EXAMPLE- FINANCIAL

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:09.192
INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO HAVE A HAVE

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.960
TO COMPLY WITH THE KNOW YOUR

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.061
CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND THAT

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.329
INCLUDES THINGS LIKE MATCHING ON

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.831
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS%

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.732
LIKE A DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:17.600
AND A SOCIAL AND DATE OF BIRTH

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.635
AND OTHERS. THERE'S REQUIREMENTS

THERE'S A LONG LIST OF STATUTES

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.381
AND RULES THATARE IN PLACE BOTH

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:35.017
IN CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.752
NATIONALLY- AT THE FEDERAL

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.154
LEVEL. AND I THINK ONE OF THE

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.655
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:40.923
MISTER GRANT HAD MENTIONED IS

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.126
THAT A LOT OF ARE A LOT OF THEIR

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.594
STRUCTURES STRUCTURES THAT WE'VE

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.795
BEEN LIVING UNDER OUR PAPER

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.964
BASED FOR AN ELECTRONIC WORLD

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.932
AND- MSTER GRANT MENTIONED SOME

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.234
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE IN

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.268
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIVATE

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:53.569
SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR TO

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:56.439
HELP. BUT THAT WAS THAT SENATOR

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:57.840
ALAN THAT GIVES YOU JUST A FEW

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.742
HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE MANY

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:03.212
STATUTES AND RULES THAT ARE OUT

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.347
THERE TO ATTEMPT TO HELP PROTECT

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:06.482
CONSUMERS. AND I WOULD JUST SAY

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.684
ON MY SIDE I THINK PART OF IT'S

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.653
GOING TO. YEAH I'VE SEEN A LOT

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.122
OF YOU KNOW BILLS FOCUSING ON.

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:15.658
PUNISHMENTS IF A COMPANY IS

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.394
BREACHED. WHICH CAN BE HELPFUL

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:19.729
AS AN INCENTIVE TO PUT BETTER

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.130
CONTROLS IN PLACE BUT YOU KNOW

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.498
IN SOME CASES YOU'RE DEALING

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:23.633
WITH A VERY SOPHISTICATED NATION

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:25.201
STATE. WHO'S COMING AFTER A

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:27.203
SMALL COMPANY AND- YOU KNOW YOU

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.938
HAVE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:29.839
ABOUT. WHETHER THE STICK IS

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.140
ALWAYS THE BEST APPROACH OR

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.275
WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:34.310
WE CAN DO TO. YOU KNOW GETTING

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:35.711
BACK TO THE POINT I RAISED

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.413
EARLIER IN MY OPENING STATEMENT.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.148
HOW DO YOU GET AWAY FROM THESE.

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.317
OUTDATED SYSTEMS WHERE KNOWLEDGE

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.553
OF MY PERSONAL DATA. MEANS THAT

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:46.289
I'D MEET. IN YOU KNOW SOME YOU

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.457
KNOW ORGANIZATIONS- WAY TO

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:49.892
TURPIN WHO'S WHO. AND ACTUALLY

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:50.993
SHIFT TO SOMETHING THAT'S A

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.561
LITTLE BIT STRONGER STAYING

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.329
FOCUSED ON. POSSESSION OF

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.964
SOMETHING YEAH I MENTIONED YOU

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:55.865
KNOW I CAN I CAN WALK INTO A

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.633
BANK I CAN WALK INTO A

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.168
GOVERNMENT BUILDING- WITH MY

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.037
DRIVER'S LICENSE MY PASSPORT.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.538
THAT MODEL THAT WORKS IN PERSON

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:03.573
WHERE THEY CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:04.640
THAT I POSSESS IN HIS PHYSICAL

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.542
SECURITY FEATURES. HASN'T

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:08.377
TRANSLATED SO WELL ONLINE. AND

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:09.779
SO I'M YOU KNOW TO GO BACK TO

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.614
WHAT I SAID BEFORE I'M A REALLY

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.416
BIG PROPONENT OF WHAT STATES

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.450
COULD DO WITH DIGITAL

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.318
CREDENTIALS YOU KNOW THE

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:16.619
COUNTERPART TO THE DRIVER'S

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.688
LICENSE AND STATE ID CARDS. AS A

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:19.922
WAY TO GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.024
THEY CAN ACTUALLY USE TO PROTECT

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:22.825
THEMSELVES. AND THAT BUSINESSES

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.393
CAN USE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.861
AGAINST ALL OF THESE ATTACKS

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.096
THAT ARE YOU KNOW USING STOLEN

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:29.932
DATA. TO COMPROMISE IDENTITY.

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.634
THOSE ARE VERY SCALABLE TAX IN

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:32.668
FACT SOME OF THE TYPES OF

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.337
ATTACKS THAT YOU KNOW THE OTHER

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.404
YOU KNOW WITNESSES WERE TALKING

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:36.772
ABOUT EARLIER. ARE NOW GETTING

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.308
AUTOMATED BY BOTS WHERE YOU KNOW

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:40.776
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO HAVE

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:41.344
SOMEBODY NECESSARILY AT THE

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.645
OTHER END OF THE LINE TO TRICK

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:43.446
SOMEBODY INTO HANDING SOMETHING

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.314
OVER. YOU GET A EITHER DOES IT

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.583
THESE DAYS IT'S AUTOMATED- SO

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.285
YOU KNOW COREY FOR INNOVATION ON

01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:51.320
THE ADVERSARY SIDE. SAYING THAT

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.189
SARCASTICALLY. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.825
REALLY WORTH NOTING. HOW

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.460
SOPHISTICATED THE ATTACKERS HAVE

01:04:57.526 --> 01:04:59.161
GOTTEN BECAUSE THESE ATTACKS ARE

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.563
SO LUCRATIVE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:01.631
YOU KNOW THE ATTACKERS CAN JUST

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:02.698
SLICE THROUGH WHATEVER WE

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:07.503
CONTROLS WE HAVE. IN PLACE. AND

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.171
SO I THINK GETTING TO THING IT'S

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.106
LIKE. STRONGER DIGITAL

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.240
CREDENTIALS MOBILE DRY LICENSE A

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:11.874
SUMP THE STATE PRIVATE. MY KNEE

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.409
THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME IN THE

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.577
NEAR TERM. I THINK WHAT YOU CAN

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:15.845
ACTUALLY DO LIKE I MENTIONED

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.413
BEFORE I USED TO RUN THE DIGITAL

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.248
IDENTITY GROUP. AT NEST. THIS

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.450
TEST DIGITAL IDENTITY GUIDELINES

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:24.353
THAT ARE- WIDELY USED NOT JUST

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.188
IN THE U. S. BUT ACROSS THE

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:26.822
GLOBE. THAT PRESCRIBE DIFFERENT

01:05:26.889 --> 01:05:27.857
LEVELS OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:28.924
IDENTITY PROOFING A DIFFERENT

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:30.826
ASSURANCE LEVELS. AND YOU KNOW

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.361
WHAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.362
HAVE SETTLED ON IS THE MID LEVEL

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:34.764
TO HAVE WHAT'S KNOWN AS I. ALE

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.599
TO IDENTITY ASSURANCE LEVEL TWO.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:37.733
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE OUT

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.568
THERE TODAY THAT ARE CERTIFIED

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.937
AS MEETING THOSE NEW SOLUTIONS.

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.073
YOU KNOW. I'LL SAY IT CAN BE. A

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.908
BIT OF A PAIN IN THE **** TO PUT

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:46.442
SOMEBODY THROUGH THEM BUT

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:47.576
ARGUABLY LESS SO THAN HAVING

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.111
YOUR CUSTOMER. AND BECOME A

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:51.180
VICTIM YOU KNOW DOWNSTREAM- BUT

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.515
LEVERAGING THOSE SOLUTIONS

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.383
CERTAINLY FOR. YOU KNOW

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.352
WEATHER'S SENSITIVE DATA OR A

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:57.853
LOT OF MONEY THAT IS AT STAKE

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.988
YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF TOOLS

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.556
THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT TODAY

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:01.257
CAN START TO HELP AND THEN

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:02.525
LOOKED AT YOU KNOW MIGRATE TO

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.659
OTHER POSSESSION BASED TOOLS.

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:06.295
LIKE A MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:09.665
IN THE FUTURE. IRAN YOU COMFORT

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.600
AND AID UNDERSTAND IT THE

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:12.501
COMMITTEE DOING SOME WORK IN

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.804
THAT YEAH I WAS I WAS GONNA ASK

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.305
YOU- AS AS JUST A FOLLOW UP TO

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.707
THAT MISTER GRAND I READ YOUR

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.574
TESTIMONY WITH GREAT INTEREST I

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:19.809
WOULD LISTEN TO A GREAT INTEREST

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.211
AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:23.813
QUESTIONS I HAD BECAUSE- YEAH I

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.648
AS I MENTIONED I MYSELF HAVE

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:26.482
BEEN THE VICTIM OF IDENTITY

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.450
THEFT ON THREE SEPARATE

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:29.085
OCCASIONS AND I GET THOSE

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.786
NOTICES THAT MY SOCIAL SECURITY

01:06:30.853 --> 01:06:32.755
NUMBER ADDRESS AND MY KIDS ARE

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.091
ON THE DARK WEB OCCASIONALLY-

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.392
AND SO I THOUGHT YOUR PROPOSAL

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:38.027
FOR MOBILE DM DRIVER'S LICENSE

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.362
WAS WAS VERY INTERESTING THE

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.529
DIGITAL CREDENTIALING WAS VERY

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.431
INTERESTING. THE QUICK THING

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.766
THAT I DID NOT SEE A DRASTIC

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.235
TESTIMONIES IS- WHETHER WE WOULD

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:47.036
NEED THE CREDIT REPORTING

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.070
BUREAUS OR FINANCIAL

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:49.705
INSTITUTIONS TO ALSO ACCEPT THIS

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:50.639
SUMMER THAT REQUIRES SOME KIND

01:06:50.706 --> 01:06:52.742
OF STATUTORY CHANGES WELL I JUST

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:53.909
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE ACTUAL

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.478
IDENTITY FRAUD TAKES PLACE IN

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.012
FINANCIAL FRAUD I AND I DIDN'T

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:59.115
SEE THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN LIKE

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.082
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE ANOTHER FORM

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.651
OF IDENTIFICATION BUT THE DID I

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:03.919
THINK THE MAIN DISCONNECT I HAVE

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.654
IS THAT THE I. D. THEFT THAT

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.356
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW ANTI

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:12.128
FRAUD IS COMING FROM ACTUALLY-

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:12.661
PRIMARILY AMONG FINANCIAL

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:13.229
INSTITUTIONS. I THINK IT'S A

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:14.363
GOOD POINTS I'LL SAY A LOT OF

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.564
OUR MEMBERS ARE FINANCIAL

01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:16.532
INSTITUTIONS AND CREDIT BUREAUS

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:17.867
ARE ALSO MEMBERS. THE LATTER

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:19.602
WEREN'T INVITED ME FIRST. THE

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.270
GROUP FIRST FORMED JOB. PART

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.038
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM. WHAT IS

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.373
IT. SOME OF THE BANKS WANT TO

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.374
GET BEYOND KNOWLEDGE BASE TOOLS

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.143
THAT THEY WERE OFFERING- BUT

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:28.377
AFTER WE PUBLISHED OUR BLUEPRINT

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:29.478
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY ALL CAME

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.646
TO US AND SO WE ACTUALLY THINK

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.481
ON BALANCE THIS IS. WHAT WE NEED

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.849
TO GO IN SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.017
COALITION ARE REGARDING THE WE

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:35.518
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.919
INDUSTRIES ALL SUPPORTING THIS

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.155
POLICY BLUEPRINT- SO THE SHORT

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.589
ANSWER THAT WAS DO YOU NEED NEW

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.358
LAWS IF YOU HAVE DIGITAL

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:42.925
CREDENTIALS TO ENABLE TO BE

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.760
ACCEPTED. YOU DON'T- THE

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.762
DRIVER'S LICENSE IS ALREADY. YOU

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.931
KNOW. TRICKIER TO FACTO YOU KNOW

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.332
NATIONAL ID TODAY FOR MOST

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.134
PEOPLE. IN CONGRESS ACTUALLY

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.235
YEAR AND A HALF AGO PASSED

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.403
SOMETHING CALLED REAL ID

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.539
MODERNIZATION ACT WHICH UPDATED.

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.674
THE STATUTE FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:07:58.741 --> 01:07:59.542
FIVE THAT CREATED THE FEDERAL

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:00.609
STANDARDS FOR THE REAL ID

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.078
DRIVER'S LICENSES. TO SAY THAT

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:05.147
IT DOES NOT HAVE TO JUST BE A

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:05.815
PLASTIC CARD IT COULD ALSO BE A

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:08.050
DIGITAL CREDENTIALS- AND BY THE

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.084
WEIGHT THAT WAS ONLY REALLY

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:12.354
NEEDED FOR THE TSA. OR OTHER

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.789
PARTS OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO BE

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.291
ABLE TO RECOGNIZE- DIGITAL

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:18.194
CREDENTIAL IN LITTLE PLASTIC- A

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.595
CARD. BUT IN THE FINANCIAL

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.963
SERVICES SECTOR WITH THE CREDIT

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.664
BUREAUS ARE PRETTY MUCH ANY

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.899
INDUSTRY. YOU KNOW TODAY THEY'RE

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:26.368
BASICALLY REQUIRED TO DO RISK

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.003
BASED ASSESSMENTS TO PROVE THAT

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:29.205
YOU REALLY ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.639
ARE YOU KNOW IN BANKING

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:31.540
INSTRUMENT PEOPLE TEND TO CALL

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.042
THE KYC PROCESS KNOW YOUR

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.978
CUSTOMER- AND SO. THEY'RE BEING

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.379
YOU KNOW IN THE DIGITAL WORLD A

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.082
MIX OF PRODUCTS TODAY- THAT.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.383
SOME OF THEM ARE QUITE GOOD SOME

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:42.551
OF THEM ARE ONCE ATTACKERS HAVE

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.119
CAUGHT UP WITH- I DON'T WANT TO

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.020
SEE THE GOVERNMENT THE ONLY

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.655
SOLUTION IS A LOT OF GREAT

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:47.490
INNOVATION HAPPENING. IN THE

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.492
SPACE A LOT OF IT BEING DRIVEN

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.026
BY COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA- TO

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:59.134
STAY AHEAD OF THE ATTACKERS. BUT. AT THE END OF THE DAY GETTING

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.369
TO THAT. HOW WOULD I SAY IT. A

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:01.303
LOT OF INDUSTRIES. TO GET. FOR

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.472
LACK OF A BETTER TERM BUT ONLY

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:04.139
THE GOVERNMENT REALLY KNOWS THE

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:04.940
GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:05.407
NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.742
AUTHORITATIVE ASHORE BY KENNEDY

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.011
AND SO YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.246
CLOSE THAT GAP BETWEEN THE

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.380
PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL CREDENTIALS

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.815
I THINK IS HOW WE START TO BRING

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.617
WORK DETERMINATIVE FACTORS INTO

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:15.117
THINGS INSTEAD OF THESE

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.119
PREDICTIVE FACTORS- BUT NO

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:19.054
INDUSTRY WOULD NOT NEED. AS FAR

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:22.191
AS I KNOW ANY ADDITIONAL LAWS OR

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.192
STATUTES TO BE PASSED

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:24.760
REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO START

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:25.561
ACCEPTING DIGITAL CREDENTIALS

01:09:25.628 --> 01:09:26.662
THAT WERE BACKED BY BY

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.697
GOVERNMENTS THEY WOULD NEED TO

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:29.331
CHANGE IN PRACTICES THOUGH IS

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:30.900
THAT CORRECT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.835
BE AT THAT DECIDE TO ADOPT YEAH

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:38.941
AND IN THIS CASE- WE'VE GOT- HOW

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.377
WOULD I SAY IT. THEY'RE ALL

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.078
EAGER TO DO THAT THESE DAYS I

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:44.747
THINK THIS IS VERY MUCH A MATTER

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.215
OF IF YOU LOOK INTO SOME OF OUR

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:47.216
MEMBERS ARE THEY'RE SAYING IF

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.350
YOU BUILD THIS WE WILL COME UP

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.419
YEAH- YOU KNOW THE COALITION

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.420
AGAIN IT WAS YOU KNOW FORMED OUT

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.489
OF THE- THE WAKE OF THE EQUIFAX

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.591
BREACH WHEN A LOT OF COMPANIES.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.892
WERE SAYING WHAT WE'RE GETTING

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:57.860
TODAY IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.528
BASED SOLUTIONS FROM VENDORS WE

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.096
NEED TO GET TO SOMETHING BETTER

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:01.964
YEAH AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.033
THEY'VE ALL COME TOGETHER TO YOU

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.235

SUPPORTING THIS COALITION

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.639
ADVOCATING FOR THE POLICIES IS

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.240
THEY ARE VERY EAGER TO START

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.876
USING THESE TOOLS- BUT I'LL JUST

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:14.944
SAY AS AN EXAMPLE AT THE FEDERAL

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.313
LEVEL WE'VE WORKED IN IN FACT MR

SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:25.821
TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM- THE

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.923
ACRONYMS TERRIBLE ALONG LIKE A

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.625
LOT OF GOVERNMENT ACRONYMS ECB

SPD ELECTRONIC CONSENT BASED

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.528
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:34.330
VERIFICATION SYSTEM IT WAS

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.297
SOMETHING THAT THE FINANCIAL

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:37.833
SERVICES INDUSTRY WENT- TO

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.235
CONGRESS AND PUSH FOR- TO TRYING

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.537
TO DRESS WHAT HAS BEEN THE

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.138
FASTEST GROWING TYPE OF IDENTITY

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:44.473
FRAUD ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.841
RESERVE WHICH IS SYNTHETIC

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.676
IDENTITY FRAUD. WHERE IT'S NOT

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.044

ESSENTIALLY A DIGITAL

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.252
FRANKENSTEIN WHERE I MIGHT TAKE.

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.664
KNOW THE BANKS AND THE COMPANIES

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.165
THAT THEY WORK WITH INTO

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.400
THINKING THAT THIS IS A REAL

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.202
PERSON IN ISSUING CREDITS YOU

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:14.403
KNOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE PUT OUT

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:15.504
A REPORT ABOUT A MONTH AGO THEY

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:16.972
SAID THIS IS NOW COSTING ABOUT

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:21.810
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:22.444
IN LOSSES IN THE BANKING SYSTEM.

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.712
ALL BECAUSE- IF I'M APPLYING TO

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.748
A BANK. ONLINE AND I SAY I'M

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.149
JEREMY GRANT WITH THE PARTICULAR

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.951
DATE OF BIRTH AND SSN. THERE'S

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.452
NEVER BEEN A WAY FOR THAT BANK

01:11:30.519 --> 01:11:31.887
OR THEIR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:34.156
END ANY VERIFICATION SIDE TO ASK

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:37.259
THE SSA. IS THERE REALLY THAT

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:39.161
PERSON WHO'S NOT THAT. AND SO

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.195
THE INABILITY TO SIMPLY GET A

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.697
YES NO ANSWER ME NOBODY'S ASKING

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:42.765
NECESSARY TO START SHARING

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:43.966
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT'S GOT

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.267
A LOT OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:47.536
ISSUES. JUST HOURS EIGHTY YES NO

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:48.270
THERE REALLY IS A JEREMY TO

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.438
GRANT WITH MY DATE OF BIRTH AND

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.407
SSN WHO'S NOT DEAD. IS AN

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:54.143
ESSENTIAL TOOL TO YOU KNOW WEED

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.644
OUT THE SYNTHETIC IDENTITY FRAUD

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.680
AND SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:58.414
BANK'S ADVOCATED FOR IT AND NOW

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.448
THEY'RE ALL INVESTING TO BUILD

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.482
IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.685
IT ACTUALLY HAS TO SAY IS

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:03.318
REQUIRED TO. COLLECT FEES AND I

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.054
THINK THEY'RE AVERAGING ABOUT A

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.522
MILLION TRANSACTIONS A WEEK NOW

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.890
THROUGH THAT AS THE SYSTEM COMES

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.358
ON A PILOT HOPEFULLY TO RAMP UP

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:11.060
TO. YOU KNOW TEN OR TWENTY TIMES

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:12.528
THAT OVER THE NEXT YEAR. SO

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:13.862
INDUSTRIES VERY HUNGRY FOR THIS

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:15.364
AND WILLING TO ADAPT- AND CHANGE

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:17.399
THEIR WAYS THANKS FOR THE I. I

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:18.901
WOULD AGREE IF I IF I MAY MISTER

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.003
CHAIR- JUST TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.105
MR GRANT SAID THAT THE FINANCIAL

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.441
INCENTIVE FOR THE BET FOR THE

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.209
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:27.810
CREDIT BUREAUS IS SIGNIFICANT

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.278
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. THE

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.846
FINANCIAL REASONS IN THE CREDIT

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:31.814
BUREAUS THAT HAVE TO COVER THE

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.883
LOSSES. AND IT'S IN IT'S IN THE

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.452
BEST INTERESTS OF ALL YOUR

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.554
QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IS IF YOU

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.522
BUILD IT WILL THEY COME AND I

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.824
AND MISTER GRANT I THINK HAS

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.492
LAID OUT A VERY GOOD CASE AS TO

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.427
WHY THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.196
IS YES AND- AMONGST ONE AMONGST

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.331
THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:55.237
ACCESS TO IN ADDITION TO THE ECB. S. V. READ MUNCH. WE ALSO HAVE

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.605
ACCESS EXAMPLE THE DEATH MASTER

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:57.439
FILE. WHICH IS JUST AS A STAPLE

01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.742
. OF SERVICE THAT. TELLS US ALL

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:02.010
OF THE DECEASED ON ACROSS THE

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:04.713
COUNTRY WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.714
SEEKING BENEFITS THAT ALLOWS US

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.250
TO- BANK CREDIT FROM BEING

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:10.185
ISSUED IN A DECEDENT'S NAME

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:12.087
OFFER IDENTITY THEFT PURPOSES.

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:13.689
WHILE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:14.990
DEATH MASTER FILE THERE'S NO

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.258
SUCH THING AS A BIRTH MASTER

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:17.926
FILE SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:20.696
HAVE ACCESS. TO NEW SSNS ARE

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:22.297
BEING ISSUED I THINK THE ECB S.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.199
V. IS A GOOD START TO GET US ON

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:26.068
THAT ROAD BUT THERE WERE ALWAYS

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.369
LOOKING FOR NEW TOOLS AND NEW

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.238
TECHNOLOGIES TO TRY AS BEST AS

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.173
WE CAN. KEEP THE INCIDENTS OF

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.342
FRAUD AS LOW AS POSSIBLE AND I

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:35.110
WOULD JUST THE TRUTH WANT TO

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.879
CLARIFY I THINK MR GRANT'S.

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:38.614
RESPONSE TO THAT JUST I THOUGHT

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.982
THE PART IN YOUR TESTIMONY WHERE

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:41.250
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.519
BETWEEN IT AND NOT IDENTIFIER

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.654
AND AUTHENTICATOR WAS WAS.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:46.722
INTERESTING AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:48.190
THAT MATCHES WITH WITH OTHER

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.458
WHAT OTHER FOLKS THAT I'VE

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:50.826
TALKED TO SAID. WHICH IS THAT

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.928
THE SS AND IS VERY USEFUL AS AN

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:55.130
IDENTIFIER- THAT IS IT IS

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.431
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WHOLE BODY

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.133
OF INFORMATION ABOUT US. IT IS

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.401
PROBABLY NECESSARY FOR THAT

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.136
PURPOSE BUT THE IDEA THAT WE

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.938
SHOULD HAVE A SECRET ASSETS AND

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:04.640
WHEN THE ASSET MOST OF OUR SSNS

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:05.574
ARE ALREADY OUT THERE ON THE

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.042
DARK WEB. MAKES LESS AND LESS

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.911
SENSE OVER TIME AND SO THE IDEA

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.412
THAT IT COULD BE USED IN A AS AN

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.480
AUTHENTICATOR THAT IS TO SAY

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.448
PROOF OF WHO I AM. RATHER THAN

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:14.950
JUST AN IDENTIFIER THERE IS

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.518
SOMEBODY NICKNAMED DAVE MEN WITH

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.020
MY DATE OF BIRTH AND- THE

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.189
FOLLOWING ATTRIBUTES- IT MAKES

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.790
NO SENSE NO E. SETTLE ON THE

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.826
MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE. NOT ONE

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.194
OF THE IDEAS THAT I WAS PITCHED

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:26.862
TO ME BY SOME OTHER GROUPS WAS

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:29.698
THE ACCESS AND PLUS- AND I TAKE

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:30.933
FROM YOUR TESTIMONY THAT PART OF

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.034
THE REASON THE MAIN REASON THAT

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.435
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S REDUNDANT

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.003
AND UNNECESSARY. IS THAT THE

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:36.171
MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE WOULD

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:37.940
ALREADY COP WITH THAT PURPOSE AT

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.775
A FAR SMALLER FRACTION THE

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:40.309
CLASSES IS THAT A CORRECT

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:43.745
SUMMARY. THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE-

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.147
GET UP TO GET TO A POINT YOU

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:46.815
KNOW MR ALLMAN BEFORE TALKED

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:47.916
ABOUT THE OLD DOG ON THE

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.818
INTERNET CARTOON YEAH- IT'S

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:50.886
WORTH NOTING THAT CARTOON IS

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:55.724
GOING TO. TURN TWENTY NINE YEARS

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.426
OLD THIS JULY. WE MEANS. THOSE

01:14:57.492 --> 01:14:58.627
DOGS ARE A- NOT WITH US ANYMORE

01:14:58.694 --> 01:14:59.461
BECAUSE DOG YEARS IN THEIR KIDS

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.296
PROBABLY HAVE PASSED ON AS WELL.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.865
THIS IS BEEN A REALLY HARD

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.867
PROBLEM TO SOLVE. AND THERE

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.702
THERE'S A REASON WE'RE STILL

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:08.270
STRUGGLING WITH IT IT'S NOT THAT

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.138
. YOU KNOW THIS YEAR HASN'T BEEN

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:12.341
GETTING ATTENTION ALL THIS TIME

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.276
YEAH BUT NO I THINK THE IDEA OF.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.510
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.845
THE WAKE OF THE EQUIFAX BREACH

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.381
YOU NEED TO REPLACE THE SSN OR

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.215
DO SOMETHING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:22.150
WITH THAT THAT. HONESTLY ALL

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:22.951
THOSE PICTURES KIND OF

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.219
CONFOUNDED ME IN TERMS OF I

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.520
WASN'T CLEAR HOW THAT WOULD

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.122
HELP. YOU KNOW MY TAKE WAS JUST

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.690
ACCEPT THAT IT'S AN IDENTIFIER

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:29.625
AND IT SHOULD NEVER BE AN

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.560
AUTHENTICATOR AND IF WE TRY TO.

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:32.861
MAKE THE S. ASCEND INTO

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:36.198
SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT- I JUST

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:37.232
DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.901
THAT FAR ALTHOUGH WE COULD

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:39.468
CERTAINLY SPEND BILLIONS OF

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.036
DOLLARS IN CONFUSE A LOT OF

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:43.138
PEOPLE. NONE OF THEM. I MEAN IF

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:43.805
I COULD JUST- I GUESS ONE

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.706
QUESTION I HAD ABOUT YOUR MOBILE

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.174
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SOMEONE WHO

01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.176
SUFFERED A BREACH. IF THE MOBILE

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.145
DRIVER'S LICENSE IS MEANT TO BE

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.346
AN AUTHENTICATOR WHICH I TAKE IT

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:53.482
IS- WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GETS

01:15:53.548 --> 01:15:54.383
BREACHED AND SO ONE OF THE

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:57.152
THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THE SS AND-

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:57.819
PLUS. IS THAT YOU COULD CHANGE

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.454
IT AT THE WAY IT WAS EXPLAINED

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.290
TO ME IF YOU COULD HAVE AN SS

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:02.591
AND ATTACHED TO LIKE A FOUR

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:03.725
DIGIT. ALPHANUMERIC CODE JUST TO

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:05.294
GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE ONE

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.061
ITERATION OF NSS AND

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.764
ALTERNATIVE- ED AND SO WHO'S

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.132
EVER BREACHED ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:11.600
IS CHANGE THE HELP OF. THEM THAT

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.168
YOU KNOW YOU SHOW YOUR

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:13.769
IDENTIFICATION. YOU ARE THEY

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:14.369
PROCREATE AND SEEN YOU COULD

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.071
CHANGE THAT NUMBER. INTO

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.006
SOMETHING ELSE I NOW PROTECT

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:19.141
PROTECTS AGAINST A LIKELY

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.243
INCIDENTS OF FUTURE HACKING IN

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.178
FUTURE THEFT- SO DOES YOUR

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.579
MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE PROPOSAL

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:28.317
HAVE SOME MUTABILITY.

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:29.184
ADAPTABILITY BUILT INTO IT AS

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.285
WELL. LOOK AT FIRST OFF I DON'T

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.520
WANT TO SUGGEST. IN FACT BRUCE

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:33.288
BECAUSE THE ONE THING YOU CAN BE

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:34.189
GUARANTEED IF YOU SAY SOMETHING

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.424
CAN'T BE ACTIVE WILL BE THEN

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.392
YOU'LL LOOK SILLY- I THINK.

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.194
THERE IS SECURITY YOU KNOW. TO

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:39.995
BE CLEAR IT'S NOT JUST A

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:41.530
PROPOSAL YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:42.597
STANDARDS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:43.732
THERE ARE COMPANIES LIKE APPLE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:46.468
WORKING. TO ACTUALLY EMBED THIS

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.136
IN THE WALLET- YOU KNOW

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.671
SMARTPHONES- THE TSA SAID

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:50.472
THEY'RE GONNA START ACCEPTING

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:51.807
THEM SOME OF YOUR NEIGHBORING

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.842
STATES LIKE. UTAH AND ARIZONA.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:56.378
HAVE STARTED TO ROLL THEM OUT-

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.479
SO IT IS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW.

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.114
CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE SOME EFFORTS

01:16:59.181 --> 01:16:59.915
UNDERWAY I'M JUST NOT FAMILIAR

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:02.250
WITH THEM- BUT IT IS. YOU KNOW

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:05.420
BACKED BY. YOU KNOW. PRETTY

01:17:05.487 --> 01:17:09.291
STRONG STANDARDS AND- IN AND

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.292
HACKABLE BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.793
LOT OF SECURITY WITH THAT I MEAN

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.594
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE HAVE

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:16.064
TODAY- I TAKE IT YOU KNOW IT'S-

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.432
THE DRUG ISSUE. HOW DO I SAY

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.234
THIS IF YOU PUT MORE SECURITY

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.268
FOCUSED ON THAT. THEN YOU'LL SEE

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.703
MORE ATTACKERS COME AFTER IT. I

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.271
THINK THAT'S ALWAYS TRUE IS WE

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.406
INNOVATE AND SECURITY AND THEN

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.774
THE ATTACKERS TRY TO CATCH UP

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:26.742
WITH US WE HAVE TO INNOVATE

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.377
AGAIN BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:29.277
IS LIKE. THE MOBILE DRIVER'S

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.946
LICENSE NUMBER COULD BE CHANGED

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.180
OR COULD NOT BE CHANGED ON YOUR

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.915
PROPOSAL. I THINK THE NUMBER IS

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:35.283
ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT IN SOME

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.551
CASES AND THAT THE DRIVER'S

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.352
LICENSE NUMBER IS JUST AN

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:38.720
IDENTIFIER JUST LIKE THE SOCIAL

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.489
SECURITY NUMBER. SHOW SSA WILL

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.424
LET YOU CHANGE YOUR SSN TODAY.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.625
IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT IT'S BEEN

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.427
BREACHED AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.229
YOU HAVE TO HIT A CERTAIN

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.163
THRESHOLD- THERE ARE WAYS YOU

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.631
CAN CHANGE IT WITH THE S. TO

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.733
STAY I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DM VIS

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.501
HANDLE IT. I DON'T SEE ANY

01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:53.869
REASON WHY YOU COULD NOT CHANGE

01:17:53.935 --> 01:17:54.936
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE IDENTIFIER

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.372
NUMBER. BUT WHAT. DIVISION I'M

01:17:57.439 --> 01:17:58.640
REALLY LAYING OUT IS HOW DO WE

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.142
GET AWAY FROM WE'RE KNOWING THAT

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.410
NUMBER ACTUALLY MEANS ANYTHING.

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:02.778
IT JUST BECOMES A MEANINGLESS

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.079
NUMBER THAT'S ONLY GOOD FOR

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.781
HELPING UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.416
WHICH GERMANY GRANTED ME AND

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.483
WHICH IS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES YOU

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.486
KNOW IN SACRAMENTO OR LA. WHO

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.522
HAPPENS TO YOU KNOW HAVE MY NAME

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.589
ALL UP THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:15.657
THING THESE NUMBERS ARE GOOD FOR

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.092
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT'S

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:18.026
SOMETHING I THINK IT'S AN

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.094
INTERESTING PROPOSAL SOMETHING

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.462
ON MY STAFF AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:22.097
TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT IN AND

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.231
GET A BETTER HANDLE ON SORT OF.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.866
THE SCOPE AND VISION YOU HAVE A-

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.535
IT'S CERTAINLY A THOUGHTFUL

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.870
PROPOSAL- I HAVE DISLIKED TWO

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:29.471
MORE QUESTIONS ERE REAL

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.340
QUICKLY- AND THE FIRST IS GOING

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:34.709
BACK TO FINANCIAL FRAUD WHICH I

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:39.981
THINK IS PROBABLY. THE MAIN AREA

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:41.483
OF MY FOCUS- WHAT DO. THINK I.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.351
THIS COULD BE. I IT AND- IS. OR

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:46.054
GRANT. REALLY ANY THAT- OF MULTI

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:47.189
. AUTHENTICATION OTHER IDEA

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:49.091
THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO. ME AND

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.093
MY STAFF- THERE ANYTIME SOMEONE

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.928
WANTS TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT. AND

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.529
ANY KIND OF CREDIT OR OTHERWISE

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:56.431
FINANCIAL. ACCOUNT IN MY NAME

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.966
AND IDENTITY THAT THAT WE HAVE

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.101
MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION THE

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.502
SAME WAY WE DO WHEN I WANT TO

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.437
OPEN A GOOGLE MAIL ACCOUNT- IS

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:03.638
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IS

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.674
MEANINGFULLY. DETERRENT TO.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.009
IDENTITY FRAUD IS THAT SOMETHING

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.544
THAT COMES WITH DRAWBACKS- ANY

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:12.547
COMMENTARY HERE WOULD BE

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.483
APPRECIATED- IS AUSTIN. SIR I

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:15.684
WELL WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:17.686
PARTICULAR SUBJECT. ALL I COULD

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:19.788
THINK OF WAS BIOMETRICS AND DO A

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:22.657
LOT THAT OCCASION- WHICH I USE

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:25.127
ALL EVERY DAY IN OUT MULTIPLE

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:27.829
WAYS TO- ENTER THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:30.232
JUSTICE DATABASE. I TOOK OVER MY

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.433
CELL PHONE THINGS OF THAT

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.503
NATURE. AND AT THIS TIME USING A

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.271
TOOL LIKE THAT I THANK CATION OR

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:38.707
BIOMETRICS. ARE STILL RELATIVELY

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:41.343
SAFE. I JUST UNDERSTAND THAT MAY

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:43.512
BE A BRIDGE TOO FAR WHEN WE'RE

01:19:43.578 --> 01:19:45.413
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW PERHAPS

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.117
THE AVERAGE INTO INDIVIDUALS.

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.686
EVERY DAY- ABILITY TO CONDUCT

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:55.090
COMMERCE IN A SECURE WAY. SO THE

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:57.159
TICKET IS SIMPLY YES I DO THINK

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.994
THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT YES I

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.695
DO THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.198
THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE- MUCH

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.767
LIKE WE ALL PREDICTED. THAT TEN

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.002
YEARS FROM NOW WE WOULD BE

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:10.038
ADAPTING TO REMOTE WORK A CRISIS

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:12.174
PUSHED US TO LEARN HOW TO ADAPT

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.177
WITH THAT VERY QUICKLY. I THE

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:18.914
ONLY PRESENCE OF IDENTITY THEFT

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.982
IS IN A CRIMINAL PERSPECTIVE. IS

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:24.386
A CRISIS. AND WE'VE SEEN SO MUCH

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:26.922
OF IT THAT UNFORTUNATELY I FEEL

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:29.624
THAT- I IT'S NOT TAKEN AS

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:31.593
SERIOUSLY AS PERHAPS IT SHOULD.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.061
BUT I HOPE I ANSWERED THAT

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:34.996
QUESTION I DO THINK IT IS THE

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:37.299
FUTURE UNLIKE SIDE PERHAPS

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:39.501
MISTER GRANT- AND THE OTHER

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:43.572
PANELISTS. I'M VERY FOCUSED ON.

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:46.474
ARE THERE ENOUGH- SOPHISTICATED

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.276
DETECTIVES ON THE STREET THAT I

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:52.013
CAN JUST ACTUALLY. FILE IS SIXTY

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.982
MILLION DOLLAR IDENTITY THEFT

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.151
FRAUD CASE SO THAT'S WHERE MY

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:58.520
DAY TO DAY AND THE FOCUS OF THE

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.255
GENERAL YOU KNOW INSURING THAT

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:01.756
WE HAVE VERY HIGHLY TRAINED

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.825
SOPHISTICATED LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.061
IS WHERE MY DAY TO DAY. BUT

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:07.495
ANECDOTALLY AS SOMEONE WHO'S

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.697
BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:11.299
YEARS. I DO SEE THE CRISIS

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:14.035
PUSHING US TO BIOMETRICS. AND

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.704
AUTHENTICATION BUT I REALLY

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.572
THINK I HAVE MISTER GRANT MISS

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.741
ALASKA'S AT MR ALLMAN. THEY

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.009
ACTUALLY ARE WORKING IN THAT

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.777
KIND OF POLICY LEVEL OF WHAT IS

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.913
PRACTICAL. I DON'T I HOPE THAT

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.414
HELPS SOME MISTER CHAIRMAN IT

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:27.349
DOES VERY MUCH THANK YOU MY SON

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.284
IS ABOUT HIS HEAD OR HAND UP IN

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:33.088
AS AS MISTER. GRANT SO LET'S

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:33.822
START WITH MISS ALASKA'S. I

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:36.324
GUESS I WANT ADD THE- WE HAVE

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:37.959
THE I. TERZI IS ENCOURAGED

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:39.327
EVERYONE TO SIGN UP FOR MULTI

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:40.862
FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ON ALL OF

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:42.197
THEIR ACCOUNTS WHEREVER IT'S

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:44.266
AVAILABLE. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:46.201
SEE THE PUBLIC ADOPTING IT EVEN

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:47.936
MORE WIDELY THAN THEY ALREADY

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:50.538
ARE THAT BEING SAID TO MAKE IT

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:53.375
MANDATORY WE HAVE TO CONSIDER

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.043
THAT THAT IS GOING TO CREATE

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:57.512
ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES FOR A

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:59.414
SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. AND

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.316
SO BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:03.718
SOMETHING LIKE THIS MANDATORY

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:05.553
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AHEAD

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:08.156
OF TIME- YOU KNOW IN MY PERFECT

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:10.025
WORLD YES. MFA WOULD BE

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.993
MANDATORY WITH IT ALL JUST HAVE

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.062
TO USE IT BECAUSE IT IT HAS. SO

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:16.298
<u>&lt;c.magenta&gt;ANY GREAT BENEFITS BUT THERE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:18.099
ARE CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT SIMPLY

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:21.069
DON'T ENGAGE DIGITALLY IN IN

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.204
THAT MANNER THEY DON'T KNOW HOW

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.472
TO HOW TO THEY WOULDN'T KNOW HOW

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.508
TO USE IT AND ADDITIONALLY WE'VE

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.243
HAD TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS WITH

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.011
PEOPLE TRULY EVEN THE ONES THAT

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:31.646
HAVE OPTED IN. TRULY NOT

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.081
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CANNOT

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.317
SURE THAT COAT HOW VITAL IT IS

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:36.618
THAT THEY DON'T SHARE THAT CODE

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:38.019
AND THEY ARE LOSING ACCESS TO

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.688
THEIR ACCOUNTS WE HAVE THOUSANDS

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:40.955
OF PEOPLE THAT WE'VE TALKED TO

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:43.024
IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. I THINK

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:45.126
I JUST LOOKED AT THE STATS IT

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.262
WAS. TOUGH FORTY ONE HUNDRED.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:50.565
ADJUSTED FOR GOOGLE VOICE AND I

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:52.033
THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.034
THOUSAND FOR INSTAGRAM SO IT'S

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:56.905
PRIMARILY ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:59.140
IT. WE WOULD HAVE BEFORE WE

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:01.209
START MAKING SOMETHING TRULY

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:03.578
COMPULSORY WE HAVE WE HAVE TO

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.746
HAVE SOME OF THOSE OTHER PARTS

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.314
ADDRESSED THE EDUCATIONAL

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.550
COMPONENT AS WELL AS THE- IN

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:10.719
ACCESSIBILITY AND THE BARRIERS

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.587
TO ACCESS THAT IT WOULD CREATE

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.555
FOR A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.357
POPULATION. THANK YOU MISS

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.158
ALASKA'S MISTER GRANT. YES I

01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:18.593
I'VE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE MFA

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.396
SPACED A REALLY LONG TIME- A LOT

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:22.630
OF MY FOCUS WHEN I WAS AT AND

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:23.965
THIS WAS PROMOTING THE ADOPTION

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:25.433
OF MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.434
AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:27.435
BETTER STANDARDS THAT COULD MAKE

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.637
IT EASIER TO DEPLOY. AND T. TO

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:30.805
MISS CLASS BECAUSE IT'S ONE I

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.474
THINK THIS IS BUT ONE OF THE

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.876
PROBLEMS HAS BEEN- A LOT OF THE

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:37.078
FIRST GENERATION. MULTI FACTOR

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.446
AUTHENTICATION WE'VE SEEN HAS

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:40.715
BEEN DEVELOPED BY. I THINK WHAT

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:44.686
I AFFECTIONATELY CALL SECURITY-WE NEED BECAUSE I AM ONE- BUT

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:45.854
IT'S BEEN FOCUSED ON THE WAY

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.322
THAT WOULD ADD SECURITY IN A WAY

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.490
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY DETRACT FROM

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.158
USER EXPERIENCE. SO EVERYBODY

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:51.459
HATES PASSWORDS ARE REALLY

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.594
REALLY HAS PASSWORD ON MOBILE

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.062
DEVICES. BUT WHEN WE'RE TELLING

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:54.763
YOU WHILE YOUR NEW

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.064
AUTHENTICATION CEREMONY IS

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.832
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PASSWORD

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:58.900
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA TEXT YOU A

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.402
CODE YOU'RE GOING TO FISH OUT A

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:01.903
TOKEN AND ENTER A SECOND

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:02.871
PASSWORD. NOBODY'S REALLY INTO

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:06.207
THAT- AND SO WHILE TURNING ON

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.976
MFA IS PROBABLY THE BEST PIECE

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.511
OF ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO ANYBODY

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.678
WHO'S WATCHING THIS HEARING OR

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.714
ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. IN TERMS

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:14.582
OF HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:16.351
THE INDUSTRY IS JUST NOW

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.786
STARTING TO DO SOME WORK AND HOW

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.354
DO YOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW MAKE

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.790
MFA SOMEHING THAT IS JUST BUILT

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:23.558
IN RATHER THAN BOLTED ON- AND

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.160
THERE I'M ACTUALLY REALLY

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:25.827
BULLISH AND I THINK WE'RE ON THE

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.395
CUSP OF. NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.596
ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS AND IT'S

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:29.697
BECOME A LITTLE CLICHE BUT I

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:30.598
THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:31.399
CLOSE TO KILLING THE PASSWORD OR

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.802
AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO- I MEAN

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.603
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. SO THERE

01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.939
IS A STANDARDS BODY- WHICH I'M A

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:39.541
SERVICE ADVISER TO CALL THE FIDO

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:41.009
ALLIANCE FIGHTER STANDS FOR FAST

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.077
IDENTITY ONLINE. MORE THAN THREE

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:43.945
HUNDRED COMPANIES FROM ACROSS

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.747
THE GLOBE IN SECURITY BANKING

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.715
PAYMENTS HEALTHCARE BY THE

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:49.751
GOVERNMENTS THERE AS WELL ALL

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:51.986
WORKING AND HOW CAN YOU ACTUALLY

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:55.557
IN BAD. PASSWORD LIST

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:56.491
AUTHENTICATION. AND YOUR DEVICE

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.126
AS OPPOSED TO HAVE TO BE SOME.

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.327
THAT'S GONNA BE BOLTED ON AND SO

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.762
YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:01.663
LIKE. IS INSTEAD OF A PASSWORD

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:02.897
WHICH IS A KNOWLEDGE BASE

01:25:02.964 --> 01:25:04.265
FACTOR. AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE.

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:05.733
IT'S YOU KNOW THE FIRST FACTOR

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.635
CAN BE UNLOCKED MY PHONE. BACK

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.337
IN BIOMETRIC ONLY ON THIS DEVICE

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:10.738
YOUKNOW. AND THEN THAT'S IT

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.307
UNLOCKS A CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY PAIR

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:13.575
THAT CAN BE USED BEHIND THE

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.677
SCENES TO LOG ME IN IN A WAY.

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:16.644
THAT'S FRANKLY MUCH MORE SECURE

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:18.680
THAN. YOU KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.215
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE ONE

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:20.849
TIME PASSCODES THAT ARE GETTING

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.450
FISH THESE DAYS. THOSE ATTACKS

01:25:22.517 --> 01:25:23.718
ARE GETTING AUTOMATED LIKE I

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.720
MENTIONED BEFORE BY BOTS. YOU'RE

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.288
THE FIRST GENERATION MFA WE HAD

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:29.090
IS NOT FISHABLE- BUT THE NEW

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:30.725
FIGHTER STANDARDS ARE NOT IN SO

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.862
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE. THE

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:34.863
WHITE HOUSE JUST. ABOUT THREE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:37.198
WEEKS AGO. FINALIZED IN TO-

01:25:37.265 --> 01:25:38.233
STRATEGY DOCUMENT FOR THE

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.100
GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU'RE GONNA

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.435
USE PHISHING RESISTANT

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:42.470
AUTHENTICATION ONLY FOR MSA.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.571
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THE

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:44.739
LEGACY STUFF ANYMORE. AND

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:45.740
POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.375
STANDARDS LIKE IF I DON'T HAVE

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.310
BEEN BUILT INTO A LOT OF DEVICES

01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:50.178
BY. ACTUALLY EVERY YOU KNOW

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.079
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:52.814
MANUFACTURER I THINK THAT'S

01:25:52.881 --> 01:25:53.448
WHAT'S GOING TO REALLY START TO

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:54.482
CHANGE THINGS GOING FORWARD.

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:57.785
NAME ADDRESS. MY LAST QUESTION-

01:25:57.852 --> 01:25:59.254
YOU KNOW GET I THINK THIS IS IN

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.222
YOUR BLUEPRINT- ACTUALLY MISTER

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:03.892
GRANT- BUT- I RECALL. SOMEWHERE

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.260
IN IN ONE OF THE TESTS MEASURE

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:07.061
THE BLUEPRINT IT WAS STATED

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:08.429
THAT. THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.665
IS BAKED INTO OUR CODES THAT WE

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:13.167
WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO IN AND

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:14.502
REMOVE SUCH. RELIANCE ON SOCIAL

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:15.603
SECURITY NUMBER. TO BE ABLE TO

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.572
MOVE TO ALTERNATIVES. SUCH AS

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:18.506
THE MOBILE DRIVER'S LICENSE YOU

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:21.276
PROPOSE- IS ANYONE HAVE YOU DONE

01:26:21.342 --> 01:26:23.478
ELSE'S OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:24.779
THE STATE LEVEL IF WE WERE TO

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:25.547
TRY TO. DO WHAT YOU'RE TALING

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:27.515
ABOUT. WHERE IN THE STATE CODE

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:28.783
WOULD WE POTENTIALLY NEED TO

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:31.519
REMOVE- REFERENCES AND RELIANCE

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.555
ON SUCH SCARY NUMBERS OR IS THAT

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.622
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD LOOK

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.391
INTO FOR US. I HAVE TO LOOK INTO

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:37.458
IT AND I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

KNOW LAWS AND REGULATIONS- ON

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:44.966
THE TOPICS IT TO KNOW- BUT- THIS

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.101
IS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:48.469
MADE. IN OUR POLICY BLUEPRINT

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.737
WHICH WAS IT WAS INTERESTING

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:54.709
WHEN WE WERE. WRITING THIS

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:55.577
BLUEPRINT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:56.844
OUR CONFERENCE ROOM. WITH YOU

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:57.378
KNOW OUR MEMBERS AND I ASK

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:58.947
COMPANIES WHY IS. TIME I SEE A

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.014
BREACH HAPPENS SSNS ARE LOST

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.016
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THESE FOUR IN

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:02.684
THE FIRST PLACE. AND THE ANSWER

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:05.353
WAS. WELL A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.188
THEM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TOLD

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:08.022
US WE HAD TO. YOUR PARTICULAR IN

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:08.923
FINANCIAL SERVICES BUT WE

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.391
ACTUALLY DID SOME ANALYSIS AT

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:12.460
LEAST LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:13.561
LEVEL. I THINK WE FOUND NINETEEN

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.163
DIFFERENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:16.464
THAT SAID. YOU KNOW COMPANIES

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:17.999
HAVE TO COLLECT AND RETAIN SSNS

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:19.367
FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES SOME OF

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.935
THEM MADE A LOT OF SENSE. OTHERS

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.637
I THINK THERE WAS ONE. THE COAST

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:23.871
GUARD SAYS IF YOU'RE REGISTERING

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:29.010

AN ACCESS AND PROBABLY BECAUSE

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:32.580
THEY WANT TO TRACK YOU DOWN IF

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.716
THERE'S A PROBLEM- SO I DO THINK

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.651
IT COULD BE WORSE- WE'VE NEVER

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.086
DONE AN ANALYSIS IN CALIFORNIA

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:38.720
THAT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE SOME

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.588
WORK. BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.923
UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.524
