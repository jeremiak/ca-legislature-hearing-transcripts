BUT BEAR WITH ME BECAUSE I FEEL

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:46.244
LIKE BECAUSE THIS IS THE DAY

00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.478
THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:49.080
OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO YOU THAT I

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.582
HAVE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.483
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.885
DONE IN ADDITION TO THAT.

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:55.820
SO JUST A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.121
ARE IN CLEAN ENERGY HERE IN

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:58.289
CALIFORNIA.

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.158
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PACIFIC

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:01.559
GAS AND ELECTRIC BASICALLY

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.895
SERVED ALL ABOUT 33% OF THE

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.763
ELECTRICITY TO THEIR CUSTOMER

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.966
FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.934
ARE IN TWENTY TWENTY WE PROJECT

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.469
THAT THAT AMOUNT WILL BE ABOUT

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.705
50% OF THEIR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:14.572
COMING FROM.

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:16.541
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.843
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.011
TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WAS SET

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:23.448
AT 28% BY TWENTY TWENTY THEY

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:24.983
SHOULD BE AT 40%.

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.017
ESTY JEANNIE SANDY --

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.052
GAS ELECTRIC IS CURRENT WITH

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:32.457
INTO THE IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:34.125
THEY'LL BE AT FORTY FIVE PLUS

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.860
SOME CHANGE PERCENT.

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.695
THIS IS ALL IN ADVANCE OF THE

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:39.764
STATUTORY EXPECTATION THAT THEY

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.966
WOULD BE AT 33%.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.469
THE ARE THESE CONTRACTS IS FOR

00:31:44.535 --> 00:31:46.738
FOR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:49.240
PROJECTS THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY --

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.575
PROJECTS --

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:53.878
THE PRICES FELL ABOUT NINE POINT

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.246
5%.

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:58.283
EACH YEAR BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:31:58.349 --> 00:32:01.352
SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.987
SO WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.088
ASSUMPTION THAT THIS KIND OF

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.323
BALL PORTRAIT PURCHASING WOULD

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.824
ACTUALLY HELP TO DRIVE DOWN

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.426
PRICES IN THE MARKET AND GAIN

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.461
EFFICIENCIES IN COMPETITION

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:11.796
WITHIN THE FIELD.

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:13.631
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:14.699
AVERAGE PRICE ACROSS THE

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.834
PORTFOLIO IN CALIFORNIA WAS FOUR

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:19.070
POINT SEVEN CENTS PER KILOWATT

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.039
HOUR THAT'S COMPETITIVE WITH THE

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.273
NEW NATURAL GAS PLANT.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.642
A VERY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:25.576
MOST OTHER --

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.979
KIND OF CONVENTIONAL GENERATION.

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:30.481
SOME UNVERIFIED REPORTS THAT ARE

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.583
IN THE SOUTH WEST OF TO CENTS

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.886
PER KILOWATT HOUR DESERT SOLAR

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:37.855
AND FOUR CENTS PER KILOWATT HOUR

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.090
FOR FOR SOLAR PLACE BATTERIES

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:41.459
THAT COMES FROM OUR ARE THE

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:42.360
COULD EVERYTHING KEPT FOR THE

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.562
LAST THE THE UNVERIFIED REPORTS

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.697
COMES FOR OUR ANNUAL.

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.598
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.900
REPORT WHICH WAS DELIVERED.

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:51.536
LAST OCTOBER TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:51.836
[inaudible]

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:53.071
SO.

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.806
SOME THINGS ARE WORKING VERY

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.040
WELL -- I

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.008
JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE

00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:58.009
HEART THEY WERE ACTUALLY

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.877
DELIVERING THE THE REQUIREMENTS

00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:02.413
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKING

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.148
PROGRESS ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT.

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:05.383
I THINK IT WILL BE ABLE TO HIT

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.586
THE THE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS FOR

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:12.056
CLEAN ELECTRICITY IN IN SB ONE

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:13.658
HUNDRED WHICH ADOPTED LAST YEAR.

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.827
HANDILY 60% IF WE'RE AT THESE

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:18.096
LEVELS NOW AND AT A GOOD PRICE

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.630
THE CHALLENGE WILL BE.

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:21.032
MEETING YOUR CARBON áUCTION

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:23.101
GOAL SINCE WE GOT 2100%

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.236
RENEWABLES AND STILL MESS ARE

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:26.037
TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FIFTY

00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:28.072
CARBON WILL ALSO COME BACK TO

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.474
THAT IN A BIT.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.075
SO A LOT OF MAJOR FOCUS

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:32.744
INTERNALLY TRYING TO BUILD THE

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.545
BUSINESS SYSTEMS THAT THE CPUC

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.280
NEEDS TO SUPPORT EVER OTHER

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:38.216
EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE --

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.918
WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.153
ENGAGING IN A LOT OF INTERNAL

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.554
RESTRUCTURING --

00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:44.622
WE HAVE STRONGER BUSINESS

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:46.324
SERVICES BUT I THINK WE HAVE A

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.725
LONG WAYS TO GO LIKE ALL OTHER

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.060
STATE AGENCIES WE HAVE A LOT

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.795
CHALLENGES AND TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.964
OF NEW THINGS IN INFORMATION

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.632
TECHNOLOGY --

00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.334
WE'RE WORKING WITH CAL I. T. AND

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:58.002
WE HAVE A NEW I. T. DIRECTOR TO

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.470
SOMEBODY WHO IS REALLY FRESH AND

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.706
HAS EXPERIENCE ELSEWHERE WITH

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:02.774
MODERNIZING THEIR SYSTEMS.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.610
A AND WE HAVE NEW INTERNAL AND

00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:07.945
EXTERNAL AUDITORS. TO THE RECENT

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.280
HIRING OF JENNY ALLEN IN

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.615
ASUNCION FROM --

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.550
FROM A ONE OF THE STATE'S HEALTH

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:13.451
AGENCIES WITH A LOT OF

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:14.919
EXPERIENCE AN INTERNAL AUDITING

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:16.788
BRINGING NEW RIGOR.

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.488
I THINK THAT THAT WAS --

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.657
US A TREMENDOUS STEP FORWARD

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:20.992
BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:23.027
WORKING IN STATE GOVERNMENT

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.162
PROGRAMS.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.164
UP PROGRESS IN RESOLVING OUR OUR

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.698
PROCEEDINGS WITHIN THE TIME

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.434
LINES THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.437
FOR US WE LAST YEAR WE RESOLVED

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.671
TWO HUNDRED NINE PROCEEDINGS IN

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.740
WITHIN THE TIME LIMITS THAT THAT

00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:38.142
WE ARE SO EXPECTED TO REACH.

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:38.643
THIRTY THREE OF THEM ARE

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:40.945
RESOLVED WITH EXTENSIONS RANGING

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:42.413
FROM TWO WEEKS TO SIX MONTHS

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.581
MOST OF THOSE WERE TO

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.650
ACCOMMODATE A SETTLING PARTIES

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:46.784
OR TO DEAL WITH SOME

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.753
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THAT THAT

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.255
THE PARTIES ARE STUCK ON NONE OF

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.723
THESE.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.427
WERE RESOLVED LATE --

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.061
TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX ARE STILL

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:59.831
UNDER WAY WE HAVE ABOUT --

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.666
ABOUT.

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:02.467
SIX HUNDRED THE PROCEEDINGS A

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:04.836
YEAR THAT WE DEAL WITH --

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:06.537
THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION WHICH IS

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.406
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY FOR

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:10.675
THE LARGE ENERGY AGENCIES OF

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.109
THEIR GENERAL RATE CASES.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.744
THERE IS ACTUALLY REQUEST FROM

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:15.346
SOME OF THE PARTIES AND FROM

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:16.481
SOME OF THE UTILITIES THAT

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:17.882
RATHER THAN DO THIS ON A THREE

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.550
YEAR ROLLING BASIS WE GO TO A

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.152
FOUR YEAR BASIS.

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.854
SO WE JUST WANT TO SIGNALED THAT

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.689
THERE'S NOT ONLY AN EXPECTATION

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.290
THAT THIS IS BECOMING MORE

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:27.658
COMPLEX GOING TO TAKE MORE.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:29.093
TIME ON OUR PART BUT ALL THE

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.062
OTHER PEOPLE COME BEFORE US AND

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.930
ARE HIGHLY LEGALISTIC LITIGATED

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:35.399
PROCEEDINGS ARE ASKING FOR MORE

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.668
TIME.

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:38.269
I'LL POINT TO SOMETHING I'VE

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.103
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHICH IS

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.171
THAT WE HAVE OVERLAPPING

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.672
AUTHORITY WITH OTHER STATE

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:44.041
AGENCIES SO IN ORDER TO REALLY

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.910
ACCOMPLISH THE STATE'S GOALS WE

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:46.944
HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WORK

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.446
CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:51.449
AGENCIES SO ARE EXAMPLES ARE.

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:53.417
WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU A MEMBER AND

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.152
OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE

00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:56.521
AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.655
SERVICES.

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:00.691
WE HAVE FOCUSED A LOT TOGETHER

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.293
HOW DO YOU DE ENERGIZE WHOLE

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.362
SEGMENTS OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:07.031
IN HIGH RISK AREAS TO REDUCE THE

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.099
RISK OF FIRE.

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:10.301
WHEN AT THE SAME TIME YOUR

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:12.336
SOMETIMES CUTTING SERVICES TO

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.305
THOSE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHO

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:15.940
NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.709
ELECTRICITY TO PUMP WATER OR FOR

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:20.411
TELECOMMUNICATIONS --

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.446
IT'S OF ENORMOUSLY COMPLICATED.

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.015
WE KNOW THAT IT CAN HELP TO

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:25.650
REDUCE RISK BUT WE ALSO KNOW

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.018
THAT IT CREATES A DIFFERENT KIND

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:27.985
OF RISK.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.687
WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK WITH

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.455
CAL FIRE GOING BACK TO THEIR

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:33.157
FIRE -- FUEL

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.325
HAZARD MAPS --

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:36.294
WHICH THE THEY PRODUCED FOR US

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.763
IN THE NEW VEGETATION STANDARDS

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.865
WHICH ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED --

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.300
WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.734
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.536
WHERE WE ACTUALLY RATHER THAN

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.738
HIRING MORE STAFF TO DEAL WITH

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.173
LAND USE PERMITTING AND AND

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.274
CALIFORNIA OF OUR MIDDLE QUALITY

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.442
ACT PROCEEDINGS.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:54.111
WE HAVE USED THEIR STAFF HAS THE

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.713
AMOUNTS OF PERMITTING THAT THEY

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.149
DO GOES DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:01.519
THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ACTUALLY.

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:01.986
IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:02.853
GOVERNMENTS.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.455
WHO ARE JUST VERY RECENTLY WE

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:05.756
COMPLETED A NEW MEMBER OF

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.325
UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL RECYCLES

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:10.027
ON WHAT DO YOU DO WITH BATTERIES

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:11.228
AND?

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:13.097
AND SOLAR PANELS AT THEIR END OF

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.600
LIFE AS WE AS WE START TO SEE A

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:17.134
LOT OF THE OLD PEAVY PANELS

00:37:17.201 --> 00:37:18.069
AGING.

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.337
THEY'RE GONNA GO SOMEWHERE

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.471
WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.840
THEM CAN BE RE MANUFACTURE.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.408
A SIMILARLY WITH BATTERIES OR

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.943
HAS NOT BEEN A LOT OF STUDY WE

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:27.778
DON'T WANT TO CREATE THE KIND OF

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.914
PROBLEM THAT WE SAW WITH CATHODE

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.282
RAY TUBES.

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:32.583
WERE THE ONLY PLAN THAT TH

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.285
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD WAS

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.786
SHIPPED TO CHINA.

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:36.988
BECAUSE THE CHINESE ARE NOT

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.322
TAKING THEM ANYMORE STATE WE

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.690
HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS.

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:40.992
AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:43.127
WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.061
THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.230
SYSTEM OPERATOR TO REGULARLY

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.499
MEET TO MONITOR AND PLANNED FOR

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.601
RELIABLE ELECTRICITY AND GAS

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.737
SERVICE WE RECENTLY HAD ACE A

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.572
HEARING AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.607
COMMISSION. TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:59.610
CHALLENGES OF BRINGING A SEE AN

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.779
FOR HOME HEATING AND COOKING AND

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.180
FOR BUSINESS IN THE SOUTHERN

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.649
CALIFORNIA REGION WITH A NUMBER

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.517
OF IMPORTANT GAS LINES GOING OUT

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:09.320
OF SERVICE AND THE THE REDUCED.

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.555
CAPACITY AT THE LEASE OKAY ANY

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.024
GAS STORAGE FACILITIES.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.792
NUMBER OF NEW POLICY INITIATIVES

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.594
WE APPROACH THIS YEAR INCLUDE --

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.062
SOMETHING ON BUILDING D.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.764
CARBONIZATION IS CALLED FOR IN

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.034
SB THREE FIFTY AN SP FOURTEEN

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:23.567
SEVENTY SEVEN AND IN THE

00:38:23.634 --> 00:38:25.169
INTERVIEW COMMISSION'S NET ZERO

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.637
BUILDING STANDARD.

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:28.639
OF IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.541
THAT TO GET TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.376
AND TWENTY FIFTY CUT GREENHOUSE

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.078
GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS WE

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.579
CAN'T JUST DO WITH CLEAN

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.448
ELECTRICITY WE HAVE TO USE

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.050
REDUCE THE USE OF GAS.

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.519
IN IN IN EXCEPT IN THE MOST

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:44.689
CRITICAL AREAS SIMILARLY WE HAVE

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:46.490
TO LOOK TO USE OF CLEAN ELECTRIC

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:49.927
FUEL'S AS A AS AS A PART OF OUR

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:51.595
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:52.730
WE DID STANDARDS ON

00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:53.731
DISCONNECTION IT SHOULD BE WE

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.266
SET STANDARDS FOR DISCONNECTION

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:56.634
AND AFFORDABILITY IT WERE --

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.803
WE DEVELOPED A BUNCH OF CRITERIA

00:38:58.869 --> 00:38:59.570
WERE FIGURE OUT HOW TO APPLY

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.906
THEM AS WE START TO SEE SOME OF

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.941
THE THE NEW CHANGES IN

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.976
EXPENDITURES THAT UTILITIES HAVE

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.778
MADE AT THE REQUEST OF THE

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:08.579
LEGISLATURE.

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:10.648
WE WILL SEE THOSE COSTS WE WANT

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.316
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:14.051
HURT RATE PAYERS IT DOESN'T

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:15.186
SHOCK THEM THAT WOULD THERE'S

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:17.354
THERE THERE'S A SMOOTH SCALE UP

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:17.788
TO PAY FOR THESE NEW

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:18.923
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:21.258
IT'S NOT ALL BAD WE KNOW THAT

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.893
OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS THE

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.762
EXPENDITURES THAT WE'VE MADE IN

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.264
CALIFORNIA ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.133
HAVE ACTUALLY REDUCED THE AMOUNT

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.702
OF ELECTRICITY THAT PEOPLE USE

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.270
SO THE EVEN WHILE OUR

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.672
ELECTRICITY RATES GROW.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:37.608
AND ARE IN THE TOP QUADRANT

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:38.776
NATURALLY.

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:40.678
OUR ELECTRIC BILLS ARE IN THE

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:42.313
LOWEST QUADRANT NATIONALLY.

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.381
AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S PROVEN

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.250
TO BE A WISE STRATEGY AND WE

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:47.551
THINK THAT WE CAN WORK AROUND

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:51.021
THE AFFORDABILITY ON ON ON SOME

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:52.556
OF THESE OTHER EXPENDITURES.

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:55.860
ARE AT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE US

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.495
IT'S FOR MORE BATTERY STORAGE TO

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:58.729
OUR SMALL GENERATOR INCENTIVE

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:00.231
PROGRAM WE'RE STARTING TO WORK

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:00.998
ON THAT.

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.601
WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A COUPLE OF

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:06.971
ROUNDS OF OF OF OF ACTING ON THE

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.606
REQUEST OF OF ONE OF THE

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.975
UTILITIES AND CLOSURE OF THE X.

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:11.675
TO MEET P. JEANNIE ON THE

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.544
CLOSURE OF DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR

00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:14.578
POWER PLANT.

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:15.913
AND WE ARE DEALING WITH THE

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.515
LEGISLATURE'S REQUIREMENT THAT

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.983
WE ACTUALLY FIND A LOT OF THE

00:40:19.049 --> 00:40:20.718
COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT NEED

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.286
SUPPORT AS A RESULT IN THE LOSS

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:24.355
OF THE EMPLOYMENT IN THE TAX

00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:25.823
REVENUE IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:26.957
AND THEN TRANSPORTATION

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.093
ELECTRIFICATION WE POINT WE WE

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.194
DID --

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.695
FOURTEEN PILOTS.

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:32.396
THAT.

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:34.832
THAT WILL ACTUALLY BRING MORE

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.433
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION A LOT OF

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.502
THAT'S FOCUSED ON FLEETS AND

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.904
PARTICULARLY AROUND THE PORTS.

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.338
AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS WE MOVE

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.940
INTO THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:44.108
HAVING.

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.376
THE ABILITY TO HAVE FLEET

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:46.744
MANAGERS WHO CAN LEARN TO

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:49.480
UNDERSTAND HOW TO BEST USE THESE

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.682
HOW IT FITS INTO THE GRAD

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:52.883
CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.452
AND THE ABILITY TO CARE FOR THE

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.987
TECHNOLOGY BECOMES REALLY

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.389
VALUABLE IT HAS THE ADDED

00:40:58.455 --> 00:41:00.024
BENEFIT OF REDUCING AIR

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.225
POLLUTION.

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.827
IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HEAVILY

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:05.329
IMPACTED BECAUSE OF DIESEL TRUCK.

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:08.666
AND SO IT IT HAS THAT KIND OF

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:11.135
BENEFIT IN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:11.435
[inaudible]

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:15.072
AS WELL SOME BONA OVERALL

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.474
BENEFIT TO THE LANDLOCKED PORTS

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.610
AND GOODS MOVEMENT INDUSTRY.

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.512
I WANTED POINT TERROR --

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.346
THE OUR ON GOING --

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:23.848
UTILITY DIVERSITY CONTRACTING

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:25.983
PROGRAM WHICH RECALL PASSED THE

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.885
UTILITIES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.220
TO DIRECT SOME OF THEIR

00:41:29.286 --> 00:41:31.488
CONTRACTING TO SMALL BUSINESSES

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.724
DEBATE DISABLED FAT AFRICAN

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.860
AMERICAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

00:41:35.926 --> 00:41:36.861
DATE OF AN AMERICAN INDIAN

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.162
COMMUNITY.

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:40.431
THIS YEAR LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:42.366
WHEN WE HAD OUR ANNUAL REPORT WE

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:45.236
CAN IDENTIFY TEN POINT FIVE

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:47.938
BILLION DOLLARS OF CONTRACTING

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.473
AND SUBCONTRACTING FROM

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.641
CALIFORNIA UTILITIES.

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.643
THAT DID NOT GO OUT OF THE STATE

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.511
IT'S STATING COMMUNITIES AND IT

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.846
WAS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.281
MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE A HARD TIME

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.383
DEALING WITH LARGE CORPORATIONS.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.552
IT'S BECOME A VERY POPULAR

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:04.989
PROGRAM THE THE BLADE OF THE

00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:05.689
LARGE UTILITIES EMBRACE IT.

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:06.090
WE FIND THAT THE

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.725
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PARTICIPATION

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.859
IS DOWN.

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.427
BUT OVERALL THE PROGRAM

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.862
CONTINUES TO GROW THAT TEN AND A

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.764
HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT MIGHT

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:14.765
OTHERWISE LEAK OUT OF THE STATE

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.200
OF CALIFORNIA TO NATIONAL

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.668
CONTRACTORS.

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.336
BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AND

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:20.738
CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR STATE.

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:22.273
WE ARE ALSO WRESTLING WITH THE

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:23.941
CHALLENGE OF FIVE THAT ANNA TALK

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.009
ABOUT NEXT OF THESE THIRD

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:27.077
PARTIES TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:28.012
AND ENERGY.

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:30.381
WHO DON'T REALLY FIT AS

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.149
REGULATED ENTITIES ARE NOT

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.851
PARTICIPATING AND THEY ARE

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.486
SHRINKING THE AMOUNT?

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:36.854
OF DOLLARS THAT COULD

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.122
POTENTIALLY GOING TO THAT

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:40.090
PROGRAM.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.625
I'M REALLY I'M GONNA COME.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.726
TO SOME OF THE MORE TOPICAL

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:44.161
ISSUES IT PROBABLY YOU WOULD

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:44.728
LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:47.164
IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.932
AND DONE IN THE RECENT ACTIONS

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:51.068
BY NEED TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:52.503
BUT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD TALK

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.138
TO YOU ABOUT THREE TRENDS THAT

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:54.338
ARE.

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.906
IN THE BACKGROUND THAT ARE

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.207
IMPORTANT IN WILL MAKE A

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:58.909
DIFFERENCE IN BY JUST FEEL LIKE

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:00.444
IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO TALK A

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.646
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT [inaudible]

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.481
SO ARE.

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:05.582
FIRST IS THAT.

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:06.917
PARTICULARLY IN THE ELECTRIC

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:08.152
INDUSTRY BUT A LITTLE BIT IN THE

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:11.055
GAS INDUSTRY WE'RE SEEING A LOT

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:14.525
OF FUN REGULATED PARTICIPANTS IN

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:16.360
MARKETS THEY ACTUALLY BY

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.295
ELECRICITY OR THE BY NATURAL%

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.930
GAS AND SERVE IT DIRECTLY TO

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:21.832
CUSTOMERS THIS IS A PHENOMENON

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.033
THAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH HEARING

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.268
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:27.104
SO A A AN EXAMPLE OF THAT KIND

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.974
OF BUSINESS IS THE DIRECT ACCESS

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.142
PROVIDERS TO SELL TO COMMERCIAL

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:33.911
INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:35.512
CAN BEAT THE UTILITY PRICE THEY

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.281
BASICALLY PAY A FEE TO WE'LL

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.949
ELECTRICITY OVER THE WIRES TO

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.017
CUSTOMERS.

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:42.886
BUT AS THE UTILITIES LOSE.

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:45.889
CUSTOMERS EITHER FROM THE THE

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.591
CLEAN COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS.

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:50.594
THE THE THE CCA'S OR IN THE GAS

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.229
INDUSTRY THROUGH THE CONTRACT

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.330
AGENTS.

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:55.265
THEY THOSE UTILITIES HAVE A

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.300
DIFFERENT MODEL FOR BEING

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.268
COMPENSATED THIS BASED ON THEIR

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.903
SALES SO I'LL COME BACK TO SOME

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.939
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:02.473
HERE.

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:04.708
IT IT IT WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:07.444
OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE.

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:10.381
IN IN IN IN THESE INDUSTRIES

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:11.849
THAT ARE RESHAPING THEM.

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:15.386
SO FOR EXAMPLE --

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.187
THE LARGEST GROWING SECTOR FOR

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.890
PURCHASES OF OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:21.925
IN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.128
AND I SUSPECT HEARING CALIFORNIA.

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:26.263
IS CORPORATE PURCHASES DIRECTLY

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.799
OF THEIR OWN GENERATORS AND THEY

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.967
PAY A FEE TO WE'LL THEIR

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:31.835
ELECTRICITY TO THEIR FACILITIES

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.003
OVER THE WIRES.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.705
THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRIBUTED

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:37.207
ENERGY AS MUCH AS FIVE GIGAWATTS

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.876
OF ROOFTOP SOLAR.

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.344
THERE IS.

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.378
THE ABILITY FOR FOR SOME

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:44.948
COMPANIES USE NATURAL GAS FUEL

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:47.151
CELLS AS A WAY THAT THEY CAN

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.019
INCREASE THEIR RELIABILITY SO

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:50.587
THE OLD NOTION THAT EVERYBODY IS

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:51.955
SEEKING CHEAP.

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.457
IS ACTUALLY BEING TURNED ON ITS

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.726
HEAD BY THESE TECHNOLOGIES

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:57.294
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FOR HOME

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.663
ELECTRIC RELIABILITY IS THE MOST

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.932
IMPORTANT THING OVER PRICE.

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:03.834
ARE PAYING AND BUYING THEIR OWN

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:06.370
SOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.672
ADDITIONAL RELIABILITY --

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.975
WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF OF CHANGE

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:13.310
IN THESE INDUSTRIES AND IF YOU

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.812
LOOK AT SOME OF THE THE

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:17.147
DOCUMENTS THAT LEAD UP TO THE

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.182
RECENT --

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:20.117
ARE PROBLEMS OF P. JEANNIE

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:22.186
PEOPLE POINT TO THE FACT THAT

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:23.487
THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS AS

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.889
BEING ONE OF THE STRESSES.

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.891
THAT ACTUALLY THE ELECTRIC

00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:29.393
UTILITIES ARE UNDERGOING.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.995
I WORRY FAR MORE ABOUT SOME

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.363
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE COULD

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.400
FACE THIS IS IN SOME WAYS

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:38.202
SIMILAR TO THE SITUATION WE

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:41.472
FOUND OURSELVES IN.

00:45:41.538 --> 00:45:42.773
TWO THOUSAND ONE WAY AND A LOT

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.541
OF THE ELECTRICITY HAD GONE INTO

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.143
THE HANDS OF THESE THIRD PARTY

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.845
PROVIDERS.

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:50.114
NOT ALL OF THEM WERE READY FOR

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.116
OR WHAT CAN BE FEROCIOUS AND

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:54.118
VOLATILE ACTRESS CITY MARKETS

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:56.019
SOME OF THEM FAILED.

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:58.021
AND THAT ENDED UP WITH PROBLEMS

00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:01.325
THAT WE SAW AS BLACKOUTS.

00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:03.060
I DON'T THINK WERE THERE BUT IF

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:04.761
WE DON'T BEGIN TO PLAN FOR WE

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.430
COULD EASILY DRIFT INTO THOSE

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.731
KINDS OF PROBLEMS.

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:10.734
SIR WE PRODUCED THIS REPORT.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.703
AND HAD HEARING THREE PUBLIC

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:15.205
HEARINGS A LOT OF RESEARCH.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.074
ON A PUBLIC WE WORK VERY CLOSELY

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.642
WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.277
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION.

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:22.012
AND WE STUDIED STE OTHER STATES

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:23.547
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DEREGULATED

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.449
THEIR ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO SEE

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:27.718
HOW THEY DID IT WHAT KINDS OF

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:28.852
PROBLEMS THEY FACED.

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:30.554
AT THE END OF THAT WE TOOK ALL

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.389
THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY FROM ALL

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:33.524
THE DIFFERENT FOLKS WHO CAME

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.459
BEFORE US RATE PAYER ADVOCATES

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:37.594
RENEWABLES DEVELOPERS ON THE

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:42.533
ROOFTOP SOLAR DEVELOPERS BATTERY --

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.801
WHOLE RANGE OF OF DIFFERENT

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.136
KINDS OF COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS.

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.604
AND WE PUT IT TOGETHER IN THIS

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:49.173
GAPS ANALYSIS WHICH WERE

00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:50.974
PROVIDING TO YOU TODAY I HAVE

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.976
TWO COPIES YEARS IS COMBINED IN

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:54.711
ONE SINGLE SOURCE.

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.548
BUT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BIG

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:59.883
THINK THROUGH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.686
ONE OF THE SMALL PARTIES FAILS.

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.688
WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T ALWAYS

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:06.323
MEET ALL OF THE LECTURE CITY

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.759
SUPPLY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WITHIN

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.961
THEIR PARTICULAR SERVICE AREA.

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.896
BECAUSE OF GEOGRAPHIC

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:15.132
CONSTRAINTS OR THE NEED FOR THEM

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.767
TO BE ABLE TO BUY FOR THOSE

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.936
REALLY HOT DAYS WE CALL THAT

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.671
RESOURCE ADEQUACY THAT'S PUBLIC

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.172
UTILITIES CODE THREE EIGHTY

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:23.373
THAT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THE

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.875
LEGISLATURE SET.

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:27.144
LAST YEAR WE ISSUED ELEVEN

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.313
WAIVERS TO THE SMALLER PROVIDERS

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.614
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T.

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:33.850
AT GETTING ACCESS. TO THAT

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:34.785
RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:37.154
AND THAT TO ME IS A WARNING SIGN

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.689
THAT WE COULD BE A PROBLEM IN

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:40.490
TROUBLE WERE WRESTLING WITH THAT

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.758
INTERNALLY.

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.860
WE THINK THERE MAY BE SOLUTIONS

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:45.195
BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:46.830
THOSE WAIVERS BECAUSE OF SINGLES

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:49.233
PROBLEMS FOR TO FOR ME.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.635
WE TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU PROVIDE

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.970
HOW DO YOU CREATE A PROVIDER OF

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:55.005
LAST RESORT TO ALWAYS BE THERE

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.640
FOR CUSTOMERS IN CASE EVERYTHING

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:57.641
ELSE GO SOUTH.

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.142
WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:00.944
DO WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:03.146
UTILITIES ARE COMPENSATED FOR

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.114
THOSE THINGS THAT THEY WILL

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.716
REMAIN DOING THEY DON'T OWN

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:06.850
GENERATION THEY'RE ALL

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:08.819
CONTRACTING FOR ANYBODY ELSE CAN

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:09.953
DO THAT.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.522
TOO BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR

00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.091
THE WIRES THE POLLS THE METERS

00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:16.760
THE OPERATIONS WITHOUT THAT.

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:18.862
PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO GO TO THEIR

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.030
OWN --

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:23.467
PROVIDER WITH CARRY THEIR

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:24.601
ELECTRONS HOME.

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:27.004
SO IT JUST DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.339
THAT -- SO

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.074
I'LL JUST COMMAND THIS REPORT TO

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:32.242
YOU IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO US IN

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.710
MORE DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:34.978
ISSUES THAT WE FACE THERE ARE

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.747
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GAMING

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.482
HERE WE ALREADY KNOW OF PROBLEMS

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:40.617
IN ROOFTOP SOLAR IN --

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:43.353
IN PACE LOANS AND IN THE THE GAS

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.821
AGENTS WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.223
CRAMMING AND SLAMMING OR

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.358
OTHERWISE CHEATING CUSTOMERS WE

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:49.826
DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THEM.

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.194
IT MAY BE TIME TO DO THAT TO WE

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.696
WANTED TO STRESS TEST FOR ALL

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.398
THESE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER SO WE

00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:55.699
HAVE SOME SENSE.

00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:56.667
OF THEIR STRENGTHS AND

00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:58.001
WEAKNESSES DO WE NEED BETTER

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.603
DISCLOSURE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.570
ACTUALLY GETTING FROM THEIR

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.472
THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS IN TERMS

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:03.206
OF THE QUALITY OF THE

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:05.275
ELECTRICITY IS A CLEAN IS IT NOT

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:05.942
CLEAN.

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:07.411
AIR THE BUYING FROM SOMEBODY WHO

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:08.612
IS ACTUALLY SELLING THEM THEY'RE

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.681
CLEAN ELECTRICITY BUT RAMPING UP

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:11.148
THERE.

00:49:11.214 --> 00:49:13.383
COAL PLANTS WE NEED TO REALLY

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.319
START TO DIG INTO THIS SORRY

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.320
HAVE GONE ON SINCE THE DAY WAS

00:49:16.386 --> 00:49:17.287
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:18.622
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED IF WE

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:21.758
DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT WILL

00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:22.626
ACTUALLY COME BACK TO BITE US.

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:23.960
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLIMATE

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:26.396
CHANGE IN THE PAST WE CONTINUE

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.964
TO TO THINK THAT THE SCALE OF

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:29.099
THE KINDS OF CHANGES WE'RE

00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:31.234
SEEING IN THE WORLD AROUND US.

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.502
MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:33.270
APPROACH A LOT OF THINGS

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.038
DIFFERENTLY IT'S NOT SO MUCH

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.973
JUST TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.443
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. TO PREVENT

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:41.178
CLIMATE CHANGE IS WHAT DO WE DO

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:43.113
NOW THAT IT'S HERE AND WE'RE

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.715
SEEING THAT IN TERMS OF FIRES.

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:45.982
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:48.218
HAVE DONE IS GONE AWAY FROM

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:50.354
SOLELY RELYING ON THOSE HARD AND

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.756
FAST STANDARDS THE THE

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.157
COMPLIANCE STANDARDS.

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:56.526
THAT WE ADOPT EVERYBODY STILL

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.395
SHOULD MEET THOSE AND WE NEED TO

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.297
GO OUT AND BE BETTER AND MORE

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.065
EFFECTIVE IN AUDITING AND

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:04.935
POLICING THEIR THEIR COMPLIANCE.

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:06.937
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.339
TREAT EVERY SECTION OF GAS

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:12.109
PIPELINE EVERY POLL EVERY WIRE

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:15.112
THE SAME SOME ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.214
IN IN IN A CHANGING WORLD CREATE

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.016
PROBLEMS.

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.017
HOW DO YOU DEFINE THEN?

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:22.986
THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOVE THOSE

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.154
STANDARDS DON'T LET THOSE

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:26.289
STANDARDS BECOME OF A CEILING

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.125
HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY IDENTIFY

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:29.826
HAZARDS AND RISKS.

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.928
THAT STAND OUT AND ALSO FOCUS ON

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:33.663
THEM SO ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.932
WE'VE HAD UNDERWAY FOR SOME TIME.

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.634
IS ACTUALLY JUST THAT WE ASK

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.603
UTILITIES COME IN AND GIVE US A

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:41.605
RISK MAP AND THEN TELL US HOW

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.874
ALL THEIR EXPENDITURES ACTUALLY

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.375
REDUCE THOSE RISKS.

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.376
SO WE GET MORE SAFETY AND MORE

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.746
SAFE BETTER AT THIS.

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.348
WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO GET

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:54.117
BETTER AT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.485
TO ACTUALLY POLICE.

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.421
IF WE ESTIMATE THAT IF WE WERE

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:58.622
TO ACTUALLY GOOUT AND POLICE

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:00.991
EVERYONE OF THOSE POLLS AND ALL

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.559
THOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.261
OF MILES OF WIRE.

00:51:04.327 --> 00:51:06.797
WE PROBABLY NEED FIFTEEN TO

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.231
TWENTY THOUSAND NEW STAFF PEOPLE.

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.400
THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:13.103
THAT WOULD BE A HUGE MANAGEMENT

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.471
CHALLENGE SHOULD BE A BIG COST.

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.206
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE CAN

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:19.242
BEGIN TO FLY THEM WITH DRONES

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:20.844
THIS IS SOMETHING UTILITIES DO.

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.180
YOU KNOW WE CAN DEVELOP PATTERN

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.815
RECOGNITION OVER TIME --

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.483
JUST AS WITH THE ENERGY IS ATION

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.652
WE CAN LEARN TO USE TECHNOLOGY

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.554
MACHINE LEARNING AND OTHER

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.489
TOLSON UL ON OUR OUR SAFETY

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:33.623
ENFORCEMENT DIRECTOR HAS

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.325
ACTUALLY GONE SO FAR.

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.093
AS TO PULL TOGETHER THE WORLD'S

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.663
FIRST WILDFIRE IN TECHNOLOGY

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:42.265
CONFERENCE WHICH IS CO SPONSORED

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:44.401
BY THE P. YOU SEE --

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.003
WE ASK CAL FIRE UC SAN DIEGO

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.572
WHICH HAS BEEN LOOKING AT THESE

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:50.974
ISSUES C. S. U. S. AND THEN A

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:52.676
COUPLE OF LARGE TECHNOLOGY

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:54.845
PROVIDERS AS A WAY TO BEGIN THAT

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:56.847
CONVERSATION WHAT'S OUT THERE

00:51:56.913 --> 00:52:00.484
WHAT SHOULD WE BE USING HOW DO

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.618
WE ACTUALLY.

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:02.352
GET BETTER THAN THAN THIS HOW DO

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.653
WE OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES THE

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.821
SCALE OF THESE --

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.590
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:08.658
ACTUALLY GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:08.825
BE.

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:11.962
SO I WILL SAY THAT ON TOP OF

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:13.663
THAT WE ALSO ARE GOING TO ADD

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.832
ANOTHER HUNDRED INSPECTORS. TO

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:16.833
DEAL AND I'LL COME BACK TO THIS

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.437
IN SB NINE THE NEW CONSTRUCTION

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:21.505
IN THE WORK THERE IT'S ORDERED

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:24.641
THROUGH THE ADVANCED VERY WILD

00:52:24.708 --> 00:52:27.043
FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT YOU

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.981
YOU YOU THAT YOU SET FORTH IN SB --

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:33.216
NINE OH ONE SO I THINK THAT DE

00:52:33.283 --> 00:52:34.284
WE CAN'T ABANDON.

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:35.685
THOSE TRADITIONAL THINGS BUT WE

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.220
HAVE TO GO WAY BEYOND THAT THE

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:38.788
SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:40.590
HERE ELSEWHERE.

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.025
IS REALLY A CHALLENGE.

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.226
AND LASTED THESE --

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:45.095
THESE TRANCES THAT WE SPENT A

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:45.862
LOT OF MONEY AT THE

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:48.131
LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION ON

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:50.367
ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY.

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:51.968
AND IT'S VALUABLE AND I THINK

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:53.637
THAT WE'VE TRIED TO BE WISE AND

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:54.571
CHOICES.

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.706
BUT A LOT OF THAT IS BUILT

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:57.841
AROUND THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.543
ASSUMPTION THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.444
INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OF A LECTURE

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.913
IT VEHICLES.

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.180
AND AS WE SEE AUTONOMOUS

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:06.449
VEHICLES STARTING TO EMERGE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.951
THERE'S THREE COMPANIES NOW HAVE

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:11.254
LICENSES TO ACTUALLY DRIVE THEM

00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:12.589
HEARING CALIFORNIA.

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:14.424
DOES YOUR FLEET'S.

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.760
THEY'RE NOT OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS.

00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:17.861
THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:20.363
ELECTRIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.933
I KEEP LOOKING FOR THE PLACING

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:24.668
K. CITY CALIFORNIA THAT CAN TELL

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.102
ME.

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.771
HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT?

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:29.639
I TALK TO PEOPLE ALL THE TIME

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.408
ABOUT WHAT IS IT MEANS THAT YOU

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:32.876
HAVE A LECTURE TO SCOOTERS AND

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.344
ELECTRIC BICYCLES NOW THAT

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.812
PEOPLE ARE USING MORE AND MORE

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.013
FOR THEIR SHORT TRIPS.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.548
IN SAN DIEGO THE UTILITY

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.684
DESCRIBES TO ME THAT ONE OF THE

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.686
SCOOTER COMPANIES HAS A DEAL

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:44.754
WHERE IF YOU TAKE SIX SCOOTERS

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.289
HOME IN CHARGE AT HOME.

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:48.191
AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT YOU

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.660
GET FREE USE AND SPECIFIC

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:51.962
ELECTRIC IMPACT.

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:53.930
IF YOU DO THAT ON THE AUTONOMOUS

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.999
VEHICLE CHARGING IT'S GOING TO

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.434
BE MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.969
THESE SIR TRENDS THAT ARE

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:01.137
EMERGING VERY QUICKLY AND I WANT

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:02.272
YOU TO HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.274
OF THEM BECAUSE I AM LEARNING

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.743
ABOUT THEM STRUGGLING WITH THEM.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.844
AND I THINK THAT.

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.746
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU IS THE

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.114
UTILITY COMMITTEE TO START TO

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:12.983
THINK ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:16.052
ALL THE STATE AGENCIES NEED IN

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.420
TERMS OF SOME OF THESE THINGS.

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:18.955
SO MY APOLOGIES FOR GOING ON A

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.523
MINUTE OF THE TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.891
ABOUT --

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:25.662
IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:27.697
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:29.199
WE'VE WORKED OUT REALLY QUICKLY.

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:31.601
SO WE HAD PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED AS

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.237
PART OF OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE --

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:36.439
BOTH OF THE WHAT WE CALL OUR

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:39.109
VEGETATE HOW WILD FIRE HAZARD

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:39.809
MAPS.

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.277
I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.779
THEM BUT THAT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.214
OF WORK WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.750
FIRES WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:49.519
ON A TIMBER FORESTRY OR OR OR

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:51.621
DAHLE LANDSCAPE ISSUES WE DO

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.156
INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.357
ANSWER WE DEPENDED ON THEM WE

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.759
WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.327
DEVELOP WHAT IS NOW AT THIS

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.229
POINT THE WAR THE US IS

00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:00.997
STRONGEST VEGETATION --

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.933
STANDARDS IN TERMS OF CLEARANCES

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.068
FOR POLES AND WIRES.

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.103
ON THE LEGISLATURE ADDED SOME

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.271
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:11.207
TEETH WE'VE WORKED VERY QUICKLY

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.475
TWO TO IMPLEMENT THAT THOSE NEW

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:15.445
PLANTS ARE BEING --

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:16.046
REVIEWED WILL BE ADOPTED THIS

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:20.517
SPRING HERE'S FIRE SEASON.

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:23.053
WE ARE WE AT THAT'S THAT'S THE

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.654
RULING UNDER WHICH WE EXPECT TO

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:25.655
BRING ON A HUNDRED NEW

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:27.590
INSPECTORS SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.926
ON HIGH HAZARD SO WE'LL FOCUS A

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.628
LITTLE BIT A NEW CONSTRUCTION.

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:32.562
AND THEN WE'LL START TO GO INTO

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.431
THE HIGHER HAZARDOUS TO GO BACK

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:35.432
TO THAT THAT TO WHAT I WAS

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.367
DISCUSSING OF OF NOT TREATING

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:38.868
EVERY POLL SOME OF WHICH ARE ARE

00:55:38.935 --> 00:55:40.070
NOT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM NOT

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:41.371
EVERY WIRE.

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.706
BUT REALLY LOOKING AWARE WE

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:44.307
THINK THERE'S THE BEST OWN

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:47.277
BENEFIT FOR THE FOR THE SAFETY --

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.945
WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT ON

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:50.780
MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS COST

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:52.348
RECOVERY --

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:54.117
THERE WE HAVE A PROCEEDING IN

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.719
UNDER WAY WE SHE HAD EXPECT THE

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:56.519
LATE -- FOR

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.621
EVERY WORKSHOP WHICH WILL BE

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:01.091
LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES ACROSS

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:03.927
THE THE US.

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.729
AND THE QUICK QUESTION HERE IS

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.397
IF THE UTILITY GETS IN TROUBLE

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:10.400
AND AND THEY CAN'T FINANCE ALL

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.268
OF THE COSTS.

00:56:12.335 --> 00:56:13.703
WHAT WE DO NEW BILL YOU GAVE US

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.505
DIRECTION SB NINE HUNDRED TO THE

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.440
STRESS TESTS AND THEN TO

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:19.442
ACTUALLY SET A LIMIT AS TO HOW

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.877
MUCH THE UTILITY?

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.579
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD SHOULD BE

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:26.015
EXPECTED TO SECURITIZED THAT

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.351
AGAINST FUTURE REVENUES SO THAT

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:31.020
THEY CAN WITHSTAND THE PRESSURES.

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.655
ON HOW I WILL SAY THAT SOME

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:33.523
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THE

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.325
QUESTION WHY WE DIDN'T JUST

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.392
START WITH THAT NUMBER.

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.627
AND I'LL JUST POINT TO THE

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.195
CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:42.031
RECENTLY WHERE CAL FIRE ISSUED

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:45.034
RECENTLY IT'S IT'S PHONE A

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:46.569
REPORT ON THE TUBS FIRE.

00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:48.037
AND FOUND THAT P. JEANNIE WAS

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.272
NOT.

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:51.074
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT READ THAT

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:54.144
REDUCE THEIR THEIR OVERALL RISK

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.779
IF WE GIVEN THE A NUMBER IN

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:58.615
ADVANCE OF THAT FINDING WOULD BE

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.617
BACK READJUSTING THAT NUMBER

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:02.886
RIGHT TODAY IN THE DANGER IS IF

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:05.288
THEY HAD ACTED ON THAT AND WE

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:06.790
HAVE ALLOWED THEM SECURITIZED.

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:10.727
BASED ON THAT THAT WOULD BE.

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.327
THAT WOULD BE A RISK TO RATE

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:12.862
PAYERS SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK WE

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.097
NEED RULES WE THINK THAT WE

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.431
SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT TILL THEY

00:57:15.498 --> 00:57:19.068
FILE A A A A PRECEDING A REQUEST

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:20.503
TO RECOVER.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.072
AFTER ALL THE COSTS ARE KNOWN.

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.809
AS OPPOSED TO UP FRONT. ONE

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:28.978
PLEASES THE THE THE THE THE

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:30.413
BANKS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.447
THEY'RE RISK IS.

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:33.016
BUT THE OTHER POOR BUT THAT ALSO

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:34.651
PUTS RATEPAYERS AT RISK SO WE

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:37.153
CHOOSE TO TO TAKE A MORE SLOW

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.088
PROCESS AT THE BACK AND SO THE

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:41.291
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REALLY --

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:44.027
BE FAIR TO THE UTILITIES BUT

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:46.062
ESPECIALLY TO FOCUS ON RATE

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.765
PAYER INTERESTS --

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:51.134
SO I JUST GOTTA KEEP GOING HERE

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:52.702
ON ON SOME OF THE OTHER --

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.370
WILDFIRE IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:55.972
SO WE HAVE UNDER WAY AND THEN

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.041
I'LL COME BACK TO TO A LITTLE

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:59.776
BIT TO WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN IN

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:01.144
TERMS OF THE BANKRUPTCY.

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.479
SO JULY WE DID RULES FOR D.

00:58:03.546 --> 00:58:06.449
ENERGIES ATION OF POWER LINES.

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.284
IS BASED ON AND CLOSE ARE OF

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.853
OBSERVATION OF THE EFFORTS THAT

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.487
SCENE DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAS

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:14.691
BEEN DOING SINCE THEIR TWO

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:16.192
THOUSAND AND SEVEN FIRES.

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.727
AND BASICALLY THEY HAVE REALLY

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.229
PUT OUT A LOT OF TELEMETRY THEY

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:22.632
COLLECT A LOT THEY HAVE --

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:24.567
THEY HAVE BEEN STUDYING WIND

00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:25.802
PATTERNS THEY KNOW THAT THE

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:28.338
NATIONAL WILD SERVICE WIND --

00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:29.839
ON MEASUREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.875
TAKEN IT PEAKS CAUSES MOSTLY

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:33.176
AIMED AVIATION.

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.377
BUT IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.746
FIRE YOU REALLY WANT TO BE

00:58:36.813 --> 00:58:37.347
LOOKING AT THE BOTTOMS OF THE

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.248
CANYON.

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:39.449
SO THEY HAD TO CREATE A WHOLE

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:41.117
NEW WEATHER SYSTEM WITHIN THEIR

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.720
SERVICE AREA THEY DEVELOPED NEW.

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.922
MODELING TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.690
WHAT THAT MEANT NOT JUST ACROSS

00:58:47.757 --> 00:58:49.559
THE REGION WHICH IS WHAT THE

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:50.660
NATIONAL WILDLIFE WHILE THE

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.095
NATIONAL FEATHER WEATHER SERVICE

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.396
DOES.

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.064
BUT IN EACH CANYON.

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.666
SO THAT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY CUT

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:57.767
OFF POWER BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.602
CONCERNED ABOUT HIGH WINDS AND

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.304
POTENTIAL FOR HAD DOWNED POWER

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:02.005
LINE.

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:04.574
THEY ONLY DO IT WHERE THEY NEED

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.109
THEY DON'T TAKE OUT THOUSANDS OF

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:07.277
CUSTOMERS.

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:09.345
BUT IT'S TAKEN OF ABOUT SEVEN

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.813
YEARS TO REALLY DEVELOP THIS NAY

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.181
WHO I'VE BEEN WATCHING SINCE I

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:13.850
FIRST CAME TO WORK ON RENEWABLE

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:14.984
ENERGY PROJECTS BECAUSE IT

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:16.519
SEEMED LIKE IT WAS AN IMPORTANT.

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.988
APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.490
RISK MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:21.624
SAFETY.

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.393
AND I THINK IT'S PROVED ITSELF

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:24.260
WE'VE ORDERED THE OTHER

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:25.828
UTILITIES TO DO IT BUT IF YOU

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.163
THINK ABOUT THE SCALE THAT THE

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.831
SAID THE UTILITIES ARE OPERATING

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:30.466
AT AND THE FACT THAT THEY DEPEND

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.168
ON THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:33.636
WHICH WHEN IT IN SHOES A WIND

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.571
WARNING DOES IT ACROSS. SIX OR

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:36.639
SEVEN COUNTIES.

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:42.745
NOT WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL CANYON

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:43.880
TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE THE

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.281
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DE ENERGIZE

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:46.783
YOU CAN ALSO CUT OFF OF

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.518
IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.787
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS NEED

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:51.087
[inaudible]

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.889
SO.

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:57.527
WE'VE FIVE WE HAVE --

00:59:57.593 --> 01:00:00.163
OPEN THE WAY TO ME IN IN OCTOBER

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.699
CPC CALLOW S. AND AND CAL FIRE

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.367
ISSUED A JOINT LETTER UTILITIES

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.868
WITH FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS THAT

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.370
WERE AIMED AT SPECIFIC NEEDS

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.871
THAT THEY HAVE BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:11.941
WARNING AND PRE PREPARATION.

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:13.476
IN THE END ABOUT DECEMBER THE

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.144
UTILITIES FILED THEIR FIRST SAID

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.180
A REPORTS ON THIS AND WERE

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:20.850
EVALUATING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.018
REFINE THE PROCESS.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.586
SO APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.421
WE ADOPTED PROTECTIONS FOR

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:28.624
CONSUMERS SO ON WHAT HAPPENS TO

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.826
PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR PHONES TO

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.260
WHAT IS OUR EXPECTATION OF THE

TELL BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IN TERMS

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:33.730

WATER BACK ON WHEN THEY GO BACK

01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:36.632
TO THEIR HOMES.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:38.434
HOW DO WE PROVIDE OTHER KINDS OF

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:39.836
VITAL SERVICES THAT THEY NEED

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.538
BOTH BEFORE DURING AND AFTER WE

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.240
MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.209
CRISIS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FIRE

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:46.976
SHELTERS?

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:49.112
WERE STARTING TO LOOK AT NOW IS

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:50.346
WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.748
ALL THESE UTILITIES IN TERMS OF

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.815
HELPING TO PREPARE FOR

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.650
EMERGENCIES --

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.219
THEY'RE THEY'RE BIG GAPS IN

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.454
WARNINGS AND TELECOMMUNICATION I

01:00:58.521 --> 01:00:59.989
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT ARE

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:00.857
PROCEEDING.

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.759
ON THE COUNTY OF CINEMAS

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:05.695
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.296
REALLY.

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.499
SHARP YOUNG FIREFIGHTERS ACT

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:11.768
CAMEL ACTUALLY DID ALLOW A BACK

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:12.902
CAST AND LOOKED AT THE

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:14.871
PERFORMANCE OF THE TELEPHONE

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.305
COMPANIES IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY

COUNTY AND OTHER PROVIDERS PUT

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.308
OUT.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:24.247
HE THOUGHT THAT THE 50% WAS

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.548
FAILURES AND TECHNOLOGY

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.750
DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY.

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.052
A MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT LOCAL

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:31.721
GOVERNMENTS HAD EXPECTATIONS OF

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:32.855
SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S A LONG

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:34.524
WAY TO GO ARE CHALLENGES THAT

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.059
THE TELCOS DO THIS ON A

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.693
VOLUNTARY BASIS IF THE USE

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.429
CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES THAN WE

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.797
DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:42.331
ORDER THEM TO DO THINGS.

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.599
THIS WILL COME UP IN THE YEAR --

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:46.235
RECONSIDERATION OF SB ELEVEN

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:48.137
NINETY WHICH DE REGULATED VOICE

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:52.375
OVER INTERNET PROTOCOLS --

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:53.810
YES SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.978
DID HIS HAS COME FORWARD WITH

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:57.680
THE NOVEL PROPOSAL FOR GRID

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:58.714
HARDENING.

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.083
SUPPOSED UNDER GROUNDING IN

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:01.451
MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WHICH IS

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.252
LARGELY INEFFECTIVE YOU'RE GOING

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.621
UP AND DOWN RAVINES OR SUBJECT

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:07.790
TO TO INTRUSION BY WATER --

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.892
THEY THEY FOUND THAT A BETTER

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:11.928
WHICH SOLUTION WAS WAS COATED --

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.530
IMPROVED COATINGS AND CONDUCTORS

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:15.965
SO THERE IS A WE'VE GIVEN WE ARE

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.300
CONSIDERING GIVING THEM

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:17.900
PERMISSION TO MOVE AHEAD WITH

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:18.835
THAT --

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:22.071
EXPECT THAT TO TO BE DONE

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.207
SOMETIME THIS MONTH.

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:24.707
HER SAFETY CULTURE --

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.641
I WE'VE BEEN LOOKING VERY

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.043
CAREFULLY AT AT CONTINUED

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.911
FAILURES ON SAFETY WITHIN P.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.680
JEANNIE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.348
WHAT IS IT THAT WE USE TO

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.250
CONDITION THEIR AUTHORITY TO DO

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.885
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.253
THAT BETTER IS A CHANGE IN THE

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.421
BOARD IS A PUBLIC

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.822
REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.591
HIS IS SPLITTING UP THE GAS FROM

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.693
THE ELECTRIC UTILITY IS IT

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:44.994
SMALLER DIVISIONS.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.230
ARE THOSE ARE ALL BIG QUESTIONS

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.798
WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE'S A

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.500
NEED THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VERY

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.535
HIGHLY LITIGATED EFFORTS THAT

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.137
REQUIRE US TO COLLECT A LOT OF

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.905
EVIDENCE YOU CAN'T PROCEED TO

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:56.672
BREAK UP.

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.875
A PROPERTY LIKE THAT WITHOUT

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:02.745
SOME THAT WERE AT THAT POINT.

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.247
I'LL COME BACK TO HOW WE WILL

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:06.582
USE OUR FINDINGS AND WHAT WE

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:08.251
THINK ARE IMPORTANT LEARNINGS

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:09.986
FROM OUR NEXT PHASE WHICH IS THE

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.254
REMEDIES WHAT DO YOU DO.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.755
WHEN YOU FIND THE COMPANY HAS

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.557
NOT MET ITS --

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.759
IT'S RESPONSIBILITIES --

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.995
WE FIND THEM WE FIND IN THE

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:20.496
BIGGEST UTILITY FINE EVER.

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.665
AND NOT A SINGLE BOARD MEMBER

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.000
LAUGHTER AND THERE ARE NO MAJOR

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:27.803
THAT IT'S NOT FINES ARE JUST NOT

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.138
ENOUGH -- WE

NEED TO GO FURTHER IN TERMS OF

UNDERSTANDING HOW DO YOU GET

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.610
TRUE SAFETY OUT OF OUT OF THESE

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:35.945
LARGE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:37.613
THAT WILL PROBABLY PLAY INTO THE

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.818
BANKRUPTCY STUFF I ALSO WANT --

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.053
TO MENTION THAT --

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.122
EXCUSE ME.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.124
IT WILL BE VOTING TOMORROW ON

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.759
AND THE CHANGES THAT YOU ASKED

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:51.894
US TO MAKE FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.329
BIOMASS FACILITIES WILL BE

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.064
MEETING HERE IN SACRAMENTO IF

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.232
FOUR HUNDRED R. STREET SO WILL

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:56.432
BE --

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.701
FINALIZING OUR DELIBERATIONS ON

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.436
THAT -- SO

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.804
THAT'S A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.172
ARE IN SB NINE A ONE

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.707
IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU HAVE MORE

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.509
QUESTIONS AND YOU THE RIRE IT AT

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.411
A RELEASE OF VATICAN.

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.679
CAN ANSWER THAT.

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.715
SO IT IN TERMS A BANKRUPTCY.

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:16.085
WE TOOK WHAT WHAT IS NOT REALLY

01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.653
AN EXTRAORDINARY STEP FOR US OF

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.422
LAST EARLIER THIS WEEK WE

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.757
ACTUALLY ADJUSTED THE RATIO

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.459
BETWEEN THEIR DATA.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.061
AND THEIR EQUITY AND THAT

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.929
HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.431
UTILITIES THEY GROW.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:29.765
THE THEY HAVE SPECIAL

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.267
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THEY NEED TO

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.602
CHANGE THAT BUT THAT'S A METRIC

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:34.770
THAT WE USED TO TO REALLY KIND

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:35.504
OF KEEP.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.907
THE COST FROM BEING PASSED ON TO

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.542
RATE PAYERS IS PARRIS TO

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:41.510
INVESTORS WITH IT'S A TOOL THE

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:44.080
USED TO MONITOR EFFICIENCY OF

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.448
THEIR USE OF CAPITAL.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.949
ON THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.217
WE MAKE THEM COME BACK TO US

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.385
WHEN THEY WANT.

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.820
TO DO ADDITIONAL FINANCING

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:54.957
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE SO --

01:04:55.024 --> 01:04:56.726
WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THE LAST

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.527
WEEK WE GOT AN APPLICATION FROM

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:01.330
P. GINNY ASKING TO CHANGE THEIR

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.498
RATIO?

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:03.666
AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.234
TELLING US THAT THEY WERE GOING

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.502
INTO BANKRUPTCY.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:07.970
NOW FRANKLY WE PROBABLY WOULD

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.372
HAD TO MAKE THE SAME KIND OF

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.806
DECISION EVEN IF THEY HADN'T

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.842
GONE INTO BANKRUPTCY BUT HAD GOT

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.443
MORE DEBT FINANCING.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.011
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.679
NORMAL HERE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.081
INTEREST BECAUSE IT WENT INTO --

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:21.484
THIS THE INTO THIS DISCUSSION OF

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.518
BANKRUPTCY.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.253
WE THINK THAT IT WAS REALLY

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.955
IMPORTANT THAT WE DID THAT

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.556
BECAUSE WE MADE A DECISION IN

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.558
ADVANCE OF THEIR DECLARING

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:30.893
BANKRUPTCY.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.296
BY DOING THAT WE PROTECT OUR

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:35.364
ABILITY TO AT SOME POINT IN THE

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.466
FUTURE REQUIRE THEM TO COME

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:39.935
BEFORE US AND SHOW THE CP YOU

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:40.736
SEE.

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.104
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.940
BORROWING AND THEIR EXPENDITURES

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:46.409
WERE REASONABLE.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.477
AND IN THE BENEFIT RATE PAYERS.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.680
IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO SET STE

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:53.015
REQUIREMENTS ON WHAT THEY USE

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:55.818
FOR COLLATERAL FOR THAT PARTY.

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.020
SO FOR THOSE REASONS IN ORDER TO

01:05:58.087 --> 01:05:59.622
PROTECT RATE PAYERS WE THOUGHT

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.424
THAT WE NEEDED TAKE THIS STEP IN

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.592
ADVANCE OF THEIR DECLARATION OF

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.362
BANKRUPTCY OTHERWISE THE JUDGE

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.164
MAY HAVE SIMPLY SAID WELL.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.365
HE DIDN'T GET PERMISSION FROM

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:10.866
THE C. P. YOU SEE I'M GONNA GIVE

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.568
YOU PERMISSION BUT I'M NOT GONNA

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.503
PUT STRINGS ON IT.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:16.439
SO FAR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:18.140
NEEDED TO DO THAT TO REALLY

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.576
ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PLAY

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.578
OUR ROLE OF PROTECTING THE RATE

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.613
PAYERS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.915
JUDGE WHO HAS TO MAKE A LOT OF

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:27.016
OTHER KINDS OF DECISION

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.084
UNDERSTOOD.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.919
THIS WAS ALREADY A REGULATORY

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.854
REQUIREMENT ADVANCE OF

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:34.457
BANKRUPTCY --

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:36.258
SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.326
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.328
GOVERNOR ARE COURT GOALS HERE

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:40.863

THERE'S GAS.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.373

AND FOR BUSINESS.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.144

WOODEN POLES ON THE SCHEDULE

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:58.447

KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL SET TO USE

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.349
THE EXAMPLE.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:36.419
OF THE LINE SUPERVISOR IN SAN

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.804
BECAUSE P. GENIES COMMAND CENTER

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.572
WAS DOWN.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.940
THEY COULDN'T COMMUNICATE THE

01:07:58.007 --> 01:07:59.375
COULDN'T TELL WHERE IT WAS.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:02.411
WE NEED THOSE PEOPLE TO STAY

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:03.712
WITH THE ORGANIZATION.

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.514
WE NEED FOR THEM TO BE THERE

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.616
BOTH AFTER BANKRUPTCY BUT DURING

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:09.685
THIS TIME TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.954

FOR WE GOT TO KEEP MAKING

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.992
PROGRESS ON A CLEAN ENERGY --

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:18.694
GOALS IN REDUCING CLIMATE

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.629
HAZARDS AND SO ALL THIS REQUIRES

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:23.966
THEM TO ACTUALLY COMMIT. TO

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.301
CONTINUE TO DO THOSE THINGS.

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.002
AGAIN ALL THESE ISSUES OF

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.604
BORROWING AND RELATED

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.506
EXPENDITURES WILL COME BACK TO

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.208
US AT SOME POINT FOR REASONABLE

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.077
IN THIS REVIEW WE NEED TO DO

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.612
THAT TO PROTECT THE RATE PAYERS.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.148
THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE ACTUALLY

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.616
UNDERSTANDS THAT HE WAS OF THE

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.118
KIT JUDGE IN THE TWO THOUSAND

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:44.487
AND ONE BANKRUPTCY.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.822
AND DIE AND HE HAS FAMILIARITY

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.791
WITH US HE IN THAT CASE HE DID

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.593
DEFERRED US HE CHOSE OUR

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:51.894
REORGANIZATION PLAN.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:56.632
OVER THE REORGANIZATION PLAN.

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.700
IT WAS YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:08:57.766 --> 01:09:00.269
COMPROMISES BUT ULTIMATELY I

DID PROVIDE GOOD [inaudible]

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:10.246
CLEAN ENERGY --

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.747
I THINK THAT THAT WE PROBABLY

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.582
WILL THINK ABOUT THINGS WE WANT

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.117
TO DO DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.186
WE WILL BE PARTY'S.

THE INTERVENOR SAID ARE

GINNY MADE THOSE PROMISES.

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:43.639
THEY ALSO HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:45.207

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.743
WE'LL SUPPORT THEIR PROMISE

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:49.111
THAT'S THEIR PLAN OF

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.479
REORGANIZATION.

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:54.016
IN IN IN GENERAL SUMMARY FOR TWO

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:54.850
MINUTES ARE OPERATING PLEA OF IT

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:56.552
IT'S NOT THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:57.820
BUT THEY WILL DO A PLAN OF

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.421
REORGANIZATION TALK ABOUT HOW

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:00.756
THEY GET OUT OF THE PROBLEM THE

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.390
TO RANT.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.192
AND WE WILL --

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.995
CONTEND WITH THEM AS ADVOCATES

FOR RATEPAYERS IN IN THE

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:13.235
BANKRUPTCY AT THAT POINT.

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:14.470
CELLS.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:15.938
OPERATING GOING TO IOWA REALLY

WANT TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS BUT

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.207
NOW WE WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU

COVER AND THIS IS YOUR ANNUAL

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.210
REVIEW SO WE ANTICIPATED THAT

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:21.777
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO BROADER

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:23.345
THAN -- THE

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:24.279
SUBJECT THAT --

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.748
CERTAINLY IS CAPTURING

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:26.582
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION RIGHT AT

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:27.816
THE MOMENT I'M SORRY I SHOULD

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.652
JUST MAKE SURE IS THERE ANYTHING

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:34.456

OKAY.

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:40.362
YEAH OKAY I JUST WANT TO ASK A

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:43.365
QUICK QUESTION ON THE IMPACT OF

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.533
ON THE MARKET HOW THE MARKETS

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.702
ARE RESPONDING TO THE UTILITIES

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:50.572
AND IN SOME INSTANCES --

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.441
GOING AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT --

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:54.410
WE MAY BE MOVING IN A PLACE

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:57.179
WHERE THERE ON INVESTABLE AND

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.982
THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS THE THE

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.817
COST OF FINANCING IMPACTS

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:04.319
ULTIMATELY ON THE RATE PAYERS --

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.721
HOW DO YOU FIT IN AND QUITE

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:08.323
FRANKLY A LOT OF FOCUSES ON P.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.293
GINNY BUT THE IMPACT IS A REPORT

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.695
IMPACT ON --

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:17.433
ESTY JEANNIE AND ALSO LISTEN.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.768
AND WE HAVE MANDATES WE HAVE

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:20.969
CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS TO SEE

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:24.239
CERTAIN PROGRAMS CONTINUE --

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.708
IF THE COST.

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.777
OF FINANCING BECOMES.

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:29.878
TO AGGRESSIVE.

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.547
THAT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT I JUST

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.582
WANT TO GET YOUR REACTIONS

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:35.918
THOUGHTS TO WHICH YOU SEE IN THE

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.387
MARKETPLACE WHAT YOU'RE READING.

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:40.656
I'M I CAN ACT LIKE I'M NOT.

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:43.192
I'M NOT SURE I CAN SPECULATE I

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.827
CAN TELL YOU THAT.

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.628
THAT S. C. IS WAITING TO FIND

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.697
OUT THE THE OUTCOMES OF

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.766
INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH THE

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.868
THOMAS IN THE WALL SEE FIRES. TO

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:56.071
THAT COULD AFFECT THE HOME THERE

01:12:56.138 --> 01:12:59.708
FROM -- THE

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.310
OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:03.612
CAPITAL --

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.647
HIGH A I I I CAN ONLY SPECULATE

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.282
AS TO WHY CAL FIRE AND OTHER

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.084
AGENCIES ARE GOING TO FIND.

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.552
IF THE YOU KNOW.

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:12.521
I DO THINK THAT AT THIS POINT

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.289
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN

01:13:14.356 --> 01:13:15.357
ABOUT HOW THE STATE OF

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.259
CALIFORNIA SCURRY ACT.

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.694
BUT I THINK AS YOU GET THAT AS

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:21.563
WE MOVE THROUGH THE EVENTS WE

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.665
WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WHAT

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:25.334
IS THE CALIFORNIANS NEED.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.236
I THINK THAT WE CAN PROJECT A

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.137
PRETTY GOOD --

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:32.374
MESSAGE IN THE ACTION THIS I

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.843
THINK WILL BE ADDRESSED BY A BY

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.178
OUR WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.613
OFFICE.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:40.749
ANA I BUT I I I DO THINK THAT

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.417
RIGHT AT THIS POINT.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.051
THEY'RE A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.988
US SHOULD THEY BE I DOUBT IT.

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.022
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT --

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.725
RENEGING ON CONTRACTS RENEWABLE

01:13:49.792 --> 01:13:51.160
ENERGY PROJECTS I DOUBT IT P.

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:52.494
JEANNIE SAID THEY WOULDN'T WE

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.163
WON'T LET THEM.

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.498
BUT THIS IS THE WORLD CHANGING

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:57.966
VERY QUICKLY IN WAYS THAT NOBODY

01:13:58.033 --> 01:14:00.602
EXPECTED.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.671
AND SO PEOPLE GET NERVOUS.

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:03.839
SAID THAT WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.440
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS BUT ALL

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.442
OF TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR.

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:09.378
OF THE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.279
OPENING THOUGHT.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.081
UP COUPLED.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.516
IT'S A LITTLE OBSERVATION --

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:17.119
WITH RESPECT --

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:21.089
TO THE I GUESS THERE'S A THERE'S

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.091
A VERY DIFFERENT READ IN.

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:25.093
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.963
RESPECT TO RATE AND BILLS.

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.665
WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH RATES LIKE

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:31.433
THIS YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY FORCING

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.803
PEOPLE? TO USE LESS ELECTRICITY.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.171
AND THEY ARE MANAGING THEIR

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:38.207
UTILITY BILLS BY THEIR COMFORT

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:39.741
LEVELS AND BY THEIR

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.043
INCONVENIENCE.

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:44.847
BY THE HIGH COST I THINK IT IS --

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:47.482
A BIT --

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:50.185
INSENSITIVE TO SUGGEST THAT.

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.653
SOMEHOW.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.255
THE POLICIES THAT HAVE COME OUT

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.656
OF THIS.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.658
LEGISLATURE IN OUT OF THE P. YOU

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:58.694
SEE ARE ARE WORTHY OF

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.330
CONGRATULATORY COMMENTS.

01:15:01.396 --> 01:15:03.265
A YOU ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO USE

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.933
LESS ELECTRICITY BY THE HIGH

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.401
PRICE TAGS.

01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:08.570
ON THEM AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.372
I DIDN'T ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:11.473
I REPRESENT.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.107
SUGGEST THAT --

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.344
HUNDRED AND FIVE DEGREE NO --

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.479
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE PRICE WISE TO

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.647
BE COMFORTABLE.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.049
AND SO LET'S JUST REMEMBER THE

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.885
CONSEQUENCES THAT SOME OF THESE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:25.053
POLICIES ARE HAVING.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.189
ON REAL PEOPLE I WANT TO FOCUS

ITS TITLE IS CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.701
GRID IS IN CRISIS CAN THE STATE

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.970

QUOTING UP WE ARE IN THE DEPTHS

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.577
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.880
WITH RESPECT TO THE MANDATES AND

01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.749

RE BOOTED.

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:05.727
THERE'S NO REAL PLAN. FOR MAKING

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.363
IT ALL WORK.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.399
HERE WE ARE THE FIFTH OR SIXTH

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:13.635
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

WELL INTO THE TWENTY FIRST

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.272
CENTURY.

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:18.674
AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. YOU

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.944

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.745
FOR MAKING IT ALL WORK.

01:16:23.812 --> 01:16:25.380
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PLEASE

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.983
I'M I'M NOT SURE WHAT ARTICLE

YOU'RE REFERRING TO SELL MY

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.486
APOLOGIES BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:33.355
LIKE SHE WAS ACTUALLY IT'S AN

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.623
APP DURING SOMETHING I SAID STE

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.590
ALL SITE THIS AGAIN JULIE CART

TWENTY NINETEEN IT WAS AND CAL

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.762

SACRAMENTO BEE.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.864
I THINK THAT SHE'S TAKING

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:44.499
COMMENTS I MADE WHEN WE FIRST

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.301
STARTED OUT THIS PROCESS A YEAR

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:48.070
AND A HALF AGO.

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.504
WHEN I SAID WE NEEDED TO START

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:50.806
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS TAKING

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:53.108
PLACE IN ELECTRICITY MARKETS AND

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.876
BEGIN TO PLAN FOR IT?

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.345
AND TO BE AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.113
THE SOLUTIONS ARE IN LOOK FOR

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.648
THE BEST PRACTICES AROUND THE

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:00.749
COUNTRY.

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:04.086
HERE IS WHAT WE THE PLAN IT'S

GET CALLS FOR INTERNAL ACTIONS

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:07.456
SOME OF WHICH WERE TO

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:08.857
UNDERTAKING SOME OF WHICH THE

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.258
ENERGY COMMISSION IS TAKING.

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.626
BUT SOME OF IT MAY REQUIRE

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.562
LEGISLATIVE ACTION SO WILL I

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:14.796
THINK THAT.

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:17.332
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE WE ARE

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:19.468

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.985
YOU ARE YOU ARE QUOTED THAT THAT

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:37.652
THERE'S NO REAL PLAN FOR MAKING

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:38.286
IT ALL WORK SOUNDS TO ME LIKE

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.355
SOMETHING I SAID AT THE FIRST

01:17:40.422 --> 01:17:41.590
MEETING KICKING OFF THIS PREVENT

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:42.657
ENEMY FOLLOW IT UP.

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.159
CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID IS IN

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.762
CRISIS THAT'S THE HEADLINE.

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.830
CAN THE STATE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.298
I'M ASKING YOU DIRECTLY DO YOU

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.267
TODAY HAVE CONCERN OVER

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.902
RELIABILITY.

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.704
AND THE ABILITY TO KEEP.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.139
THE LIGHTS ON AND TO QUOTE MAKE

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:59.975
IT ALL WORK WITH THE KINDS OF

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.377
MANDATES THAT ARE BEING --

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.780
PUT FORWARD PRESENTLY.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.114
I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S SOLELY

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:07.282
THE MANDATES I THINK IT'S THE

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.017
LACK OF THE ADDITIONAL

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.186
COMPONENTS THAT WE IDENTIFY HERE

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:12.587
THAT WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE I

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:14.056
DON'T THINK WE'RE AT THAT POINT

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:15.157
NOW.

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:16.725
I THINK THAT WE CAN EASILY SLIP

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.360
INTO IT IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.995
TAKE ACTION THAT'S WHY SPEND

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:21.963
TIME TRYING TO TO SPEAK ABOUT

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.032
THIS I WANTED YOU TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:25.600
THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES.

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:29.104
WE HAVE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:29.671
THEM MAY REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:30.205
ACTION.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:32.674
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:34.376
AND THEN WHAT WE CAN DO IS GET

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:36.478
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE GETS OUT

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:37.979

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:32.634

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:36.271
DIVISION OF COSTS BETWEEN THE

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.873

UTILITIES.

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:35.397
IN THE SENATE SAID IF THE

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.165
THURMOND SOLUTION THAT IF YOU

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.300
ENDED UP WITH.

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:39.868
ONE P. JEANNIE CUSTOMER THEY

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:42.237
KNOW BILLIONS SO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.805
IF WE END UP WITH ONE P. JEANNIE

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:46.141
CUSTOMER THEY DON'T KNOW BILLION

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.676
SO THAT'S ALL.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.710
WELL UP AGAIN --

01:20:48.777 --> 01:20:49.811
COMMISSIONER PETER MEN CAME UP

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:52.380
WITH A VERY TOUGH DECISION THAT

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.749
WAS NOT UNIVERSALLY POPULAR YEAH

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:57.953
AND I SUSPECT THAT I WILL ALSO

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.854
COME UP WITH THE DECISION THAT'S

01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.690
NINE UNIVERSALLY POPULAR.

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.124
HOUSE AND SO FORTY JUSTICE WE

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.426
THINK THAT THERE MAY BE NEED FOR

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.194
LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN SOME AREAS

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:07.395
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:10.699
LIKE OUR DECISIONS WHO MAY ASK

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:12.067
YOU TO MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:12.934
SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.036
UNDERSTAND WHY WE GOT TORY I

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.037
THINK YOU DO.

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.306
THAT'S WHY THIS REPORT BECOMES

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.140
VERY IMPORTANT YEAH.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.042
THEN MY NEXT QUESTION REALLY

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.311
DEALS WITH THE OTHER UTILITIES

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.946
AND WHY THEY ARE GOING INTO

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.781
PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW STANDARD AND

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:27.749
POOR'S FITCH.

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:31.353
MOODY HAVE MADE THE BONDS FOR AT

01:21:31.419 --> 01:21:35.390
THIS IN AND FOR SEMPRA.

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:36.558
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.026
JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOVE JUNK

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.794
BOND STATUS SO THEY ARE VERY

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:41.529
EXPENSIVE THEY'RE CONSIDERED

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:45.066
MEDIUM OR LOW QUALITY RIGHT NOW

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.002
THAT COULD WELL GET.

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.104
TO A JUNK BOND STATUS.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.305
AND IT'S REALLY THE FACT THAT

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.373
AND I DON'T THINK EVERYONE

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.942
UNDERSTANDS THIS THE FACT THAT

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.710
P. JEANNIE WAS FOUND.

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.879
NOT TO HAVE CAUSED THE TWENTY

01:21:57.946 --> 01:21:59.247
SEVENTEEN FIRE.

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:02.617
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:05.353
LOST AND YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.289
HEAD YES AND THAT'S GOOD --

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.057
BASICALLY THEY'VE LOST OUR

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.860
ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS AND

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.762
THEY WERE THEY HAVE TO BORROW

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:15.530
TWO BILLION EVERY YEAR.

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.299
IN ORDER TO GO ON AND JUST DO

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.701
THEIR NORMAL SERVICE AND THEY

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.736
COULD NO LONGER DO THAT.

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:22.971
BOB AND THAT'S AND THEN THE

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.105
WHILE THEY DO HAVE CASH

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.373
AVAILABLE.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.910
ONCE YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD CREDIT.

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.278
THEN THE ENERGY COMPANIES THAT

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:31.946
ARE SELLING YOU ENERGY DEMAND

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.848
THAT YOU PUT MONEY IN THE BANK.

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:36.918
AND MY SON WAS IN CHARGE OF

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:39.554
LOOKING AT HOW YOU WOULD IN FACT

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.056
PUT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BANK AND

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.724
THERE REALLY WASN'T ENOUGH.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.526
SO WAS REALLY THE CREDIT MARKETS

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.261
THAT BECAUSE THAT.

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:48.263
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.565
THE POSSIBILITY THAT.

01:22:50.632 --> 01:22:51.366
WITHOUT.

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:52.767
ANY --

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:54.469
DETERMINATION OF WHO'S

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.771
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WHAT --

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:59.040
FITCH SAID IS WE COULD LOWER OUR

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.509
RATINGS ON THE COMPANY SOUTHERN

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:03.078

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.245
NOTCHES.

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.647
IF POLITICIANS AND ARE

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:08.283
REGULATORS DO NOT TAKE CONCRETE

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.451
STEPS TO TAKE.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.319
EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THESE GROWING

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:15.290

DISASTER AID IN SAN BRUNO --

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:30.305

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:35.510

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.470
CRITERION A METHODOLOGY TO

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:38.206
INFORM DETERMINATION OF WHO

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:39.741
WOULD PAY FOR WHAT IN THE WILD

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.710
FIRES -- AND

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.246
IN THE I. R. C. P. YOU STATED

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:49.050
THAT CONSISTENT WITH SECTION

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:49.651
FORTY FIVE FOUR FIVE ONE POINT

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:52.020
TO A DID YOU TERMINATION OF WHAT

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.988
COSTS AND EXPENSES ARE JUST AND

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.156
REASONABLE.

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.192
MUST BE MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.993
AN APPLICATION FOR THE RECOVERY

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.495
OF SPECIFIC COSTS.

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:02.230
RELATED TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:03.465
WILDFIRES [inaudible]

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:05.066
NOW WHAT.

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:07.535
THEY GO ON TO SAY IN THIS WHAT

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.671
J. P. JEANNIE SAYS IS THAT.

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:12.240
THEY THEN LOST CONFIDENCE.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:14.976
THAT ARE THE P. YOU SEE WOULD

01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:18.246
ALLOW THEM. TO SECURITIZED THIS

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.814
IN IN PARTICULAR.

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:21.716
THEY FEEL THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:25.153
HAD -- TO

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.288
PAY EVERYTHING UP FRONT AND THEN

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.857
HAVE A DETERMINATION AND THEY

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.792
WEREN'T AT ALL SURE WITH THAT

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.293
DETERMINATION WOULD BE.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.295
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT P. G. ANY

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:37.665
EQUIPMENT THAT BECAUSE THE

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:38.833
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRE IN THE

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.068
TUBS CASE.

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.369
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE SUING

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:42.403
THEM BECAUSE THEY GET IN TURN

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:45.406
POWER OFF AND IN THE CASE OF SAN

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.108
DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC.

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:49.077
YOU MADE THEM FULLY RESPONSIBLE

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:50.778
FOR THE COST BECAUSE THEY HADN'T

01:25:50.845 --> 01:25:52.180
TURNED THE POWER OFF.

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:53.915
IN WHAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.316
DANGEROUS SITUATION.

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:58.186
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT DECISION

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:00.655
OR DO YOU IN THESE CASES.

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.824
BUT THE FACT IS THAT BECAUSE OF

01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:04.092
THIS -- WHY

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.827
ARE THIS?

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.129
AGAIN C. P. U. C. P.YOU SEE

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.864
ORDER THEY'RE CLAIMING THAT

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:12.267
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY COULD

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.502
NO LONGER GET ANY KIND OF CREDIT.

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.204
AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.405
BANKRUPTCY --

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:19.340
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOUR WHY ARE IN

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:22.010
FACT DIDN'T DO THIS AND IF SO

01:26:22.076 --> 01:26:24.879
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE I ARE DID.

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.481
FIRST OFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:28.082
ALWAYS GONNA NOT WHEN YOU TALK

01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:31.052
THANK YOU.

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.521
SO AGAIN IT'S OUR BELIEF BASED

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:34.989
ON THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.558
DIDN'T ADOPT YOUR BILL THAT THIS

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:38.493
IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU EXPECTED US

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.261
TO DO THAT'S THAT'S FIRST IN OUR

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:42.697
MINDS WHEN WHEN WHEN YOUR YOUR

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:45.833
BILL WITH DID NOT SHOW UP IN IN

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.169
IN -- SB

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:48.836
NINE ONE OUR ASSUMPTION WAS THAT

01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:50.772
YOU WANTED TO USE OUR EXISTING

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:53.408
PROCESSES WHICH REQUIRE THAT THE

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:55.310
COMPANY BRING FORWARD ALL THE

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.879
CLAIMS AT ONE TIME.

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.814
SO THAT WE CAN REALLY ASSESS

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.149
THEIR COSTS.

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.418
IF WE HAD DONE THAT IN ADVANCE

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.987
OF THE TUBS FIRE WE MIGHT HAVE

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:07.755
ALLOWED THEM TO BORROW MORE

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:10.758
MONEY AT BAD RATES. TO BE ABLE

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.460
TO PAY CLAIMS THAT THEY WEREN'T

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:14.195
REQUIRED TO DO AND THAT WOULD

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.097
BEEN PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS SO

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:18.099
IN OUR IT IN IN OUR ESTIMATION

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:20.301
WE DO NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:21.669
THOSE FULL COSTS IN ONE

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:22.804
APPLICATION.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.272
IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT BANKRUPTCY

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:26.407
COURTS TO THE ASSEMBLED ALL THE

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.376
CREDITORS IN ONE PLACE SO THEY

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.777
CAN MAKE AN INFORMED JUDGMENT

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:31.379
AMONGST ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:32.647
HAVE CLAIMS YEAH BUT WHAT P.

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.515
GENIES SANE AND THIS IS THEIR

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.851
INTERPRETATION OF THE WHY ARE.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:38.553
IS THAT THEY WOULD THEY BELIEVE

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:40.121
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY ALL

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:43.358
THE CLAIMS AND THEN THEY WERE

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:44.392
NOT AT ALL SURE.

01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:45.393
THAT YOU WOULD IN FACT ALLOW

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.495
THEM TO SECURITIZED AN AMOUNT

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:48.062
THAT WOULD KEEP THEM OUT OF

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:49.364
BANKRUPTCY.

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:50.865
AND THEY FEEL THAT'S THE REASON

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.667
WHY THE CREDIT MARKETS AFTER

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.235
THIS HEARING REMAIN CLOSE TO

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:56.337
THEM AND THEY SUBSEQUENTLY FILED

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.939
A THEY MADE THEIR DECISION BASED

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.273
ON THEIR OWN REASONS AND THEY

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.042
WENT TO HAD EVEN THOUGH THEY

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.910
WERE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.012
COSTS FOR THE TUB FIRE WHICH

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:04.746
REDUCE.

01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:06.047
THEIR POTENTIAL LIABILITY

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.383
SIGNIFICANTLY THEY COULD HAVE

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.051
GONE OUT FOR FINANCING.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:13.955
THIS WAS THEIR CHOICE AYE AYE I

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:15.056
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.391
THEM YEA OR NAY.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.692
THIS WAS THEIR CHOICE WHAT THEY

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:18.926
SAY ABOUT IT.

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.728
IS WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT WELL

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.397
AGAIN THEY'RE SAYING THEY WENT

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:24.866
INTO BANKRUPTCY NOT BECAUSE OF

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.367
THESE LIABILITIES.

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:27.835
BUT BECAUSE THE CREDIT MARKETS

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:29.837
WERE CLOSED TO THEM BECAUSE OF

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:31.739
THIS DECISION THAT YOU MADE ON

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:33.374
JANUARY TENTH BUT THEY DIDN'T

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.777
EVEN GO OUT TO TALK.

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:37.512
AGAIN.

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.814
AFTER THE TUBS FIRE TO SEE

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.215
WHETHER THERE WAS SOME FORM OF

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:43.284
FINANCING THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:44.919
ACTUALLY MET THEIR NEEDS THEY

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.521
WENT AHEAD.

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:47.922
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TUBS

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:50.124
ANNOUNCEMENT SO I CAN'T I CAN'T

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.927
PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES I KNOW

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:53.861
WHAT THEY SAY.

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.329
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID DOESN'T

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:57.598
MATCH UP ALL RIGHT SO GIVEN THE

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:59.567
WHY ARE THAT YOU HAVE.

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:04.238
SHOULD EDITION AND ARM A SEVEN

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:05.473
SAN DIEGO --

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.108
GAS ELECTRIC SHOULD THEY BE

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.976
CONFIDENT.

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.845
THAT IF THEY HAVE A FIRE.

01:29:10.912 --> 01:29:13.247
AND THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:16.050
SECURITIZED THIS IN SUCH A WAY.

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.351
THAT IT WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.920
GO INTO IT THAT'LL KEEP THEM OUT

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.121
OF BANKRUPTCY SHOULD THEY BE

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.856
CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS.

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:24.625
IS STANDARD AND POOR'S FITCH AND

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:27.628
MOODY'S ARE THEY BEING ARE THEY

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.530
THEY SAID THEY DON'T TRUST YOU.

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:31.432
BASICALLY THE STATE SAY THEY

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:32.066
DON'T TRUST ANYBODY IN

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.535
CALIFORNIA SOME WELL THAT'S TRUE.

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:35.603
BUT THEY'RE SAYING THEY DON'T

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.039
TRUST YOU WHAT CAN YOU DO

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:40.875
[inaudible] TO KEEP. TO GAIN

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:42.710
THAT TRUST OR WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.178
GAIN THEIR TRUST THAT WE REALLY

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:46.280
WILL ALLOW THEM TO SECURITIZED

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.548
ENOUGH DEBT.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:48.216
THAT THEY DON'T GO INTO

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.984
BANKRUPTCY I CAN'T MAKE FALSE

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.220
PROMISES IF WE WERE TO ADOPT A

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:55.223
NUMBER.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:55.857
AND THEY WERE TO BORROW AGAINST

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:57.191
IT.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.993
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WAS

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.895
A REASONABLE. TO PROTECT RATE

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:02.997
PAYERS WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.966
REQUIRE RATE SHAREHOLDERS TO

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.901
TAKE UP THEIR SHARE OF IT BUT

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.669
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:11.205
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY THAT

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:12.807
YOU WILL ALLOW THEM WHICH IS

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.542
DONE IN THE CASE OF SAN BRUNO

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:16.110
BUT IS NOT BEEN DONE FROM WHAT I

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.245
CAN TELL HERE?

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.447
THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM TO HAVE

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:21.516
ENOUGH EQUITY TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.351
HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:25.119
THAT WAS MADE VERY CLEAR.

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.888
IN THE CASE OF SAN BRUNO AS A

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:29.023
RESULT OF THAT THE VICTIMS WERE

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:30.892
ABLE TO BE PAID.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.827
WHEN THEY GO INTO BANKRUPTCY AND

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:34.862
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT YOUR

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.164
FOR SCENE OR THAT A PARTICULAR

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:38.432
CLAIM IS FORCING THIS IS

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:39.901
SOMETHING WALL STREET IS?

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:41.569
FORTY YOU HAVE TO ASSURE WALL

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:44.605
STREET THAT YOU WILL ALLOW THEM

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.741
TO SECURITIZED ENOUGH DEBT THAT

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.075
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.777
BANKRUPTCY IF YOU DO THAT.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.245
THEIR CREDIT CAN GO UP AGAIN AND

01:30:51.312 --> 01:30:52.246
THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO INTO

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:54.482
BANKRUPTCY AND WE CAN THEN

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:55.950
ASSURE THAT THE FIRE VICTIMS

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.251
WILL GET PAID I'M A LITTLE

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.153
DUBIOUS ABOUT THAT --

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:02.557
BUT I WILL SAY THE HI YOU YOU

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:05.426
MISTAKE WHAT WE DID IN THE SAN

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:07.195
BRUNO DECISION THAT HAD NOTHING

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:08.930
TO DO WITH BANKRUPTCY THAT HAD

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.865
TO DO WITH HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:12.099
WE SHOULD FIND THEM.

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.568
BEFORE THEIR COST OF BORROWING

01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:15.002
WENT UP THAT'S AN ENTIRELY

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.304
DIFFERENT CASE.

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:17.605
AT THAT POINT ALL THE COSTS WERE

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:19.340
KNOWN.

THAT.

01:33:22.296 --> 01:33:23.731
THAT I KNOW THAT THE RULE MAKING

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:26.667

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:33.541
I I I KNOW THAT BY LAW THE THAT --

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:35.242
NO WE WE ACTUALLY WE ACT TOOK WE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.544

ELECTRICITY TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE

IN FIRE HAZARD AREAS BUT THAT'S

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.075
NOT GOING TO DO IT.

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.576
I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.479
PREPARED IN ANY WAY HERE IN THE

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:47.781
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:49.683
ENORMITY OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING SO

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:52.553
I'LL GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF THE

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:54.688
OF THE CAR FIRE. FORTY SIX MILES

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:57.091
OVERNIGHT CAUSED BY A FIRE.

01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:58.659
AT FTA IF GOT CAUGHT FROM A CAR

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.365
CLOUT.

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:05.366
I CAN'T MIKE I I WHEN I SAY I'M

NOT PREPARED I CAN'T WRAP MY

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.103
HEAD AROUND THAT.

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:10.170
I CAN'T THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.805
NOT PREPARED THERE MANY THINGS

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.974
THAT WE ARE DOING I THINK WE

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.542
WILL CONTINUE TO DISCOVER THEIR

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.611
MORE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO.

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.947
I THINK WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.482
WHAT WE NORMALLY DO THE

01:40:21.548 --> 01:40:23.751
INSPECTIONS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:24.385
WHY WE'RE BRINGING MORE PEOPLE

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:26.920
ON BUT I GOT TO SAY.

01:40:26.987 --> 01:40:28.655
WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF THINGS

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:30.758
WE'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.

01:40:30.824 --> 01:40:33.093
AND SO I'VE LISTED SOME OF THE

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.829
OUR THEIR TOOLS THAT WE CAN GIVE

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:37.231
YOU TO HELP MOVE SOME OF THIS

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.933
ALONG.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.535
BECAUSE I THERE'S AN URGENCY

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:43.237
ABOUT.

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:46.340
YOU KNOW AND THIS AND YOU KNOW I

01:40:46.407 --> 01:40:47.775
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:49.443
UNDERSTAND SOME OF IT IS YOURS

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:51.011
BUT IS SOME OF IT I THINK IS

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:52.746
CONCENTRATING ON WHERE WE THINK

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.548
THE RISK IS HIGHEST RATHER THAN

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.016
TREATING ALL PIECES OF THE

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:57.084
SYSTEM I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.685
WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.888
GETTING THAT EXTRA ATTENTION BUT

01:41:00.954 --> 01:41:03.190
I THINK IS HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:04.858
USE THE RESOURCES WE'VE GOT.

01:41:04.925 --> 01:41:08.095
IN PLACES WHERE THE BIGGEST RISK

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:08.829
IS.

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.798
ABOUT ASKING FOR A OF LISA HAS

EXPECTED WE SAW WHAT WAS GOING

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:20.841

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.984
INTENSE WINDS IN VERY SPECIFIC

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.637
PROPOSALS THAT THEN CAN BE

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:37.904
IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.840
AGENCIES AT THE STATE FEDERAL

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.308
AND LOCAL LEVELS.

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.410
I THINK THAT'S HOW WE REALLY

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:44.611
MAKE ME LEAPS AND BOUNDS OF

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:46.146
PROGRESS BECAUSE AS LONG AS WE

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:48.915
JUST KEEP TRYING TO PUSH ON ONE

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:50.517
ELEMENTS OF THIS.

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:51.952
IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE A

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:53.620
DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN THE KIND

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:59.493
OF TIME THAT WE ALL WOULD LIKE

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:01.228
TO SEE IT.

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:03.296
THANK YOU WENT ONE FIVE JUST A

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.097
FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABOUT IT I

01:45:04.164 --> 01:45:06.233
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU JOIN US

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:08.335
AT OUR FIRE WHILE TECNICA.

01:45:08.402 --> 01:45:09.336
OR WELFARE TECH GUY --

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:09.970
CONFERENCE BECAUSE I THINK THIS

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:10.570
YOU ASKED THE QUESTION THAT

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:11.672
WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES WE KNOW

01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:13.974
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.810
DO AND SHOULD DO FROM MY

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:17.911
PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHY I THINK

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.246
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.614
IS CONVENING THE OTHER STATE

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:21.682
AGENCIES.

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:22.849
SOME OF WHOM HAVE BETTER

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.785
INFORMATION BETTER EXPERIENCE IN

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:28.055
TERMS OF FIRE THAN WE DO.

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:32.993
WELL TO TO YOU I DON'T.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:33.994
I WOULD JUST HAVE TO HELP MOVE A

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:35.495
JUST YOU MIGHT CONSIDER --

01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:36.296
THE COUNTRY OF CHILE.

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.364
AS A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ALERT

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:37.998
SYSTEM WHICH WE FOUND OUT ABOUT

01:45:38.065 --> 01:45:40.434
WHILE WE WERE THERE --

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.102
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'VE DONE

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.436
IT -- DOCTOR

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:44.771
DID BUT THEY HAVE FIGURED OUT A

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:45.906
WAY.

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:47.641
TO POINT WHO THEY WANT TO NOTIFY

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:48.975
AT A NATIONAL SCALE.

01:45:49.042 --> 01:45:50.510
SO THEY CAN DO IT THAT WAY WE

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:51.078
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.345
CALIFORNIA.

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:53.747
OF THE FINAL THE FINAL THING AND

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:55.716
I THINK AND I DO THANK YOU

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.684
MISTER CHAIR I APOLOGIZE.

01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:59.453
FOR IS THE AYE AYE WE MIGHT ONE

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:00.620
OF MY CONCERNS I'VE HEARD USE

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:01.955
MENTION OVER AND OVER AND

01:46:02.022 --> 01:46:03.423
TALKING ABOUT RATE PAYERS

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:05.192
ANSWERED ABOUT REPAIRS AND SO ON

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:07.327
AS WE GO TO IMPLEMENT THESE FIRE

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:08.762
PLANS --

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.964
THAT WILL BE BORN ON THE BACKS

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.532
OF RATE PAYERS.

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:14.735
BUT AT WHAT POINT.

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.236
WHERE IS THAT YOU KNOW?

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:17.170
YOU WERE WAY IN SAFETY VERSES

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:19.606
RATE PAYERS --

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.208
YOU KNOW I WOULD HOPE WE COULD

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:22.542
ERR ON THE SIDE A SAFETY --

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.544
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:27.180
CHALLENGES HERE.

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.749
WELL WE TEND.

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:32.252
TO S. S. COMMISSIONERS FOCUS ON

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:34.921
SAFETY BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:46:34.988 --> 01:46:36.757
RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:39.059
THAT THERE ARE THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:40.193
WHO SPEAK TO IN IN OUR

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.795
PROCEEDINGS WHO HAVE VALID

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:42.529
POINTS.

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.431
SO WE TRIED TO BALANCE THAT NEXT

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.233
THAT COMES TO THIS QUESTION OF

01:46:46.299 --> 01:46:47.901
REASONABLE IS WHAT CAN WE

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.703
REASONABLY DO THAT'S GOING TO

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:51.071
CREATE SAFETY WITHOUT

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:53.840
UNREASONABLY INCREASING COSTS.

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:56.042
SO I THINK THAT THAT ON BALANCE

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:58.145
WE HAVE DONE A LOT MORE IN TERMS

01:46:58.211 --> 01:46:59.813
OF SAFETY THAN WE DID IN IN

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.748
PREVIOUS YEARS --

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.483
I THINK THAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSED

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.685
ON THAT PERSONALLY SINCE I GOT

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.120
TO THE CPUC.

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:10.991
BUT I ALSO I ALSO THERE ARE

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.359
OTHER THINGS WHERE WE ARE

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:14.361
PROBABLY GOING TO BE VERY STRONG

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.962
ON THIS QUESTION IN THAT HAS A

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:18.465
LOT TO DO WITH WHAT THE UTILITY

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:21.735
DOES IN IN IN IN ADVANCE OF AND

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:23.670
DURING BANKRUPTCY. TO BE ABLE TO

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:25.205
RECOVER WE THINK THERE ARE

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:26.773
THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.842
WE NEED TO ALLOW AND SPEAK TO

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:29.876
THAT ALLOW THEM BECOME FINANCE

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:30.443
SIMPLE.

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.545
BECAUSE WITHOUT MONEY THEY'RE

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:32.779
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:33.814
THINGS.

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.448
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE DON'T

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:37.083
WANT TO MAKE ON WISE DECISIONS

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:39.386
THAT DISADVANTAGED RATE PAYERS

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:44.157
THEIR THANK YOU HONEST

01:47:44.224 --> 01:47:45.192
MURATSUCHI.

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:47.394
THANK YOU I WANTED.

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.563
TO CONTINUE THE LINE OF

01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:53.533
QUESTIONING OF DOCTOR WOULD --

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:56.469
YOU KNOW I READ THE FRONT PAGE

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:57.737
ARTICLE FROM THE LOS ANGELES

01:47:57.804 --> 01:48:00.006
TIMES FROM JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH --

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:02.509
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO --

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.344
QUESTIONING --

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:07.147
WHETHER THE PC --

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.749
IS.

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:12.419
CAPABLE OF EXERCISING THE

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:14.688
NECESSARY OVERSIGHT.

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:17.390
AND ENFORCEMENT OF OF FOUR

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:19.259
WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS.

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:23.230
AND TO I I I JUST WANTED.

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:24.965
TO QUOTED THROUGH A TO MAKE SURE

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:25.832
THAT -- THAT

01:48:25.899 --> 01:48:26.967
THEY WERE COURTING YOU FAIRLY

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:29.536
BUT THE ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:30.403
MISTER PICKER.

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:32.005
YOU HAD TESTIFIED THAT PERHAPS

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:33.506
AT TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.407
HEARINGS --

01:48:34.474 --> 01:48:37.143
IT DOESN'T SPECIFY HERE THAT.

01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:38.678
TO THAT THE PC IS PRIMARILY AN

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:39.946
ECONOMIC REGULATOR WITH THE

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:41.381
CENTER FOCUS AND MAKING SURE

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.750
COMPANIES PROVIDE ENERGY --

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:46.419
AT REASONABLE RATES --

01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:48.355
THE AGENCY THAT HAS NEITHER THE

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:50.156
TECHNOLOGY NOR MANPOWER TO

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.658
ENSURE SAFETY COMPLIANCE ON ITS

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.360
OWN -- AND

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:55.562
SO I WILL FIRST OF ALL IT IS IS

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:56.897
THAT A FAIR --

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:58.798
ASSESSMENT OF THINK THAT WHEN I

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.867
WAS SPEAKING TO IS THAT OUR

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:03.937
PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR REVIEWING

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:07.941
UTILITY PERFORMANCE IS NOT. TEN

01:49:08.008 --> 01:49:09.743
THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD

01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:10.377
LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDER OF

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:11.878
EVERY --

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.413
EVERY UTILITY ALIGNMENT OF THAT

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.348
IN FACT WE DO WHAT MOST STATE

01:49:15.415 --> 01:49:17.617
AGENCIES TO IN TERMS OF SAFETY

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:20.053
WHICH IS THAT WE REQUIRE THEM TO

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.388
SUBMIT PLANS.

01:49:21.454 --> 01:49:23.156
REVIEWS REVIEW THOSE PLANS WOULD

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.124
LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:25.992
THE RIGHT KINDS OF CONTROLS TO

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.661
BE ABLE TO MEET THE STANDARDS

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:28.762
THAT'S THE CEILING THAT I'M

01:49:28.828 --> 01:49:30.697
TALKING ABOUT.

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:34.668
AND THEN WE GO OUT AND AND TO IF

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:35.235
AUDIT.

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:36.403
AND THEN WE DO SPOT CHECKS TO

01:49:36.469 --> 01:49:37.871
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE AUDIT

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:39.406
TELLS US IS ACTUALLY TRUE.

01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:41.308
AND SO THAT'S WHAT A RATE MAKING

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.909
AGENCY DOES AND THAT'S WHAT WE

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:45.312
DO AND HISTORICALLY.

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:47.847
I THINK WE ARE INCREASING OUR

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:50.116
ABILITY TO BE IN THE FIELD I

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:54.421
WILL I WILL JUST ECHO WHAT WHAT --

01:49:54.487 --> 01:49:54.754
WHO -- LISA

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:58.658
SAID THE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT

01:49:58.725 --> 01:50:03.964
IS HE'S A NEW APPROACH DRESSES

01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:06.866
S. HAZARDS RATHER THAN SIMPLY

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:08.234
ENFORCING TO THE CEILING.

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:10.303
AND THAT I THINK IS WHAT I WAS

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:13.139
TRYING TO SPEAK TO YA I I'M SURE

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:14.808
I SAID THAT AS WELL.

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.609
IF YOU BUY ME THE ONLY TIME TO

01:50:16.676 --> 01:50:17.243
MAKE SURE WE GET THE WHOLE QUOTE

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:18.511
IN THERE.

01:50:18.578 --> 01:50:19.112
ALRIGHT SO --

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:20.680
IT'S A FAIR ENOUGH SO SO YOU'RE

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:22.148
SAYING ESSENTIALLY THAT ARE I

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:22.882
THINK YOU YOU THROUGHOUT A

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:23.850
NUMBER.

01:50:23.917 --> 01:50:25.852
THAT TODAY WOULD TAKE FIFTEEN TO

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:26.987
TWENTY THOUSAND DO STAFF TO BE

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.288
THAT'S THAT'S A BACK OF THE AREA

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:29.923
THE END BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.924
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:32.625
THIS SURE IS I THINK LISA

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:33.560
POINTED OUT.

01:50:33.626 --> 01:50:36.096
THAT MAY NOT THAT'S THAT'S ONE

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:37.897
THING IT PROBABLY NOT ALL THAT

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.899
WE NEED TO DO AND IT MAY NOT BE

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.501
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF WE

01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:43.203
REALLY WANT TO GET.

01:50:43.269 --> 01:50:45.005
MORE SAFETY FAST WE WE HAVE TO

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.007
LEARN HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER IN

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:48.842
DIFFERENTLY A SUPPOSED TO JUST

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.910
DOING WHAT WE DO MORE AND BETTER

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:52.612
I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.481
TRYING TO SAY HERE AND OKAY --

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:55.482
FAIR ENOUGH AND AND AND THAT'S

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:56.416
WHAT YOU BEEN EMPHASIZING THIS

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.785
WATER FOR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE

01:50:58.852 --> 01:50:59.452
IN ITS RIGHT PLACE IT WHETHER WE

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:01.021
CAN LEARN AND WE CAN BRING OUT

01:51:01.087 --> 01:51:02.288
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:51:02.355 --> 01:51:03.023
BEEN LEARNING IN OUR

01:51:03.089 --> 01:51:04.591
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:06.126
COUNTRIES THE AUSTRALIANS ARE IN

01:51:06.192 --> 01:51:07.627
SOME RESPECTS CLOSEST TO US.

01:51:07.694 --> 01:51:09.763
IN ALL AT LEAST THE KIND OF TALK

01:51:09.829 --> 01:51:10.964
ABOUT HER CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:12.298
THEM BUT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.176
SOLUTIONS ARE IT'S BECAUSE THERE

01:51:23.243 --> 01:51:24.711

FOR MAKING.

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.958
THESE ARE LARGER TRENDS THAN ANY

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:40.527

GOT IT TO OTHER STATES BUT YOU

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.348

THAT.

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:06.586
CURRENTLY A TEAM OF NINETEEN

PREVENTION SAFETY AUDITS SPOT

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.992
CHECKS WHILE ALSO INVESTIGATING

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:14.694
WHAT FIRES I KNOW YOU TALKED

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:17.063
ABOUT ADDING MORE STAFF BUT THE

HOW MANY MORE STAFF ARE WE

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:18.465
TALKING ABOUT [inaudible]

01:52:18.531 --> 01:52:23.069
WE SO THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:26.272
TO A CURRENT STAFFING L. WITH WE

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:28.908
HAVE DONE TODAY ACTUALLY IS

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:30.610

CONTRACTORS OUT TO PERFORM

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.019
ADDITIONAL WORK IN THE FIELD.

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:40.720
ELM.

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:46.559
AND WILL BE SCALED TO AND L.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:48.828
ACTUAL PHYSICAL ABILITY TO

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:50.296
PERFORM THE KIND OF WORK IS THAT

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:51.431
VARIOUS LIMITATIONS OF HOW MANY

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:53.433
PEOPLE YOU CAN BRING ON HOW FAST

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.767
AND FOR THEM TO BE EFFECTIVE.

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:56.035
BUT WE WILL BE THROUGH A

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:58.671
CONTRACTING MECHANISM INCREASING --

01:52:58.738 --> 01:52:59.906
THE MOUNT OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:01.074
THE JUST PEOPLE WHO HEALTH

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:02.509
PATROLLING LINES OF THE DISTANCE

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:04.144
OF THE WORK THE UTILITIES ARE

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.178
DOING JUST TO PROVIDE SOME OF

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:05.979
THAT.

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:07.280
ADDITIONAL --

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:09.516
ASSURANCE AND SUPPLEMENTS ARE

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.251
STAFF BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. NINE

01:53:11.317 --> 01:53:12.752
TWO PEOPLE IS NOT GOING TO COVER

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:14.654
THE ENTIRE STATE SO HOW MANY

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.322
MORE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

01:53:16.389 --> 01:53:18.224
ELM THE THE DETAILS OF THAT WILL

01:53:18.291 --> 01:53:20.193
HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT ELAM AS WE

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:22.629
RAMP UP THIS PROJECT BUT IT'S AN

01:53:22.695 --> 01:53:24.330
UP AS PRESIDENT PICK A SAID.

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:29.636
I THINK IN THE ORDER OF OVER A

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:30.837
HUNDRED HOME.

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.338
STAFF IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

01:53:32.405 --> 01:53:34.240
COULD BE FEASIBLE AGAIN THROUGH

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:35.875
THIS THROUGH THE L..

01:53:35.942 --> 01:53:37.744
CONTRACTING MECHANISM BUT THE AT

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:38.645
AND THAT'S STILL NOT.

01:53:38.711 --> 01:53:39.546
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:41.014
PATROLLING EVERY MILE OF LINES

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.582
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:43.583
ALL TIMES.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:46.352
SO IT STILL ONLY PROVIDE SOME

01:53:46.419 --> 01:53:48.288
ADDITIONAL OWN ABILITY TO

01:53:48.354 --> 01:53:50.023
INSPECT BUT THAT THE A JUST ONE

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:51.291
MAKE SURE THAT THE EXPECTATION A

01:53:51.357 --> 01:53:53.092
SAID THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:53:53.159 --> 01:53:54.394
PATROLLING EVERY EVERY MILE.

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.762
BUT WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:57.931
WILDFIRE MAPS AND WE HAVE THE

01:53:57.997 --> 01:53:59.232
WILD FOR MITIGATION PLANS

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:01.434
UTILITIES ARE FILING WE CAN USE

01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:03.736
THAT AS A AS A WAY TO TO TO

01:54:03.803 --> 01:54:06.406
ACTUALLY FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN.

01:54:06.472 --> 01:54:08.208
TO PICK THE GREATEST HAZARDS SO

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:10.143
WE KNOW THAT AS WE GET THROUGH

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:13.246
THIS FIRST ROUND OF THE WILD

01:54:13.313 --> 01:54:15.682
FIRE MITIGATION PLAN IMPLEMENT

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.717
ENTERED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.285
PROGRAM WILL LEARN SOMETHING AND

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:20.520
WILL PROBABLY COME BACK AND

01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:22.422
APPLY THAT NEXT YEAR IN A

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:23.089
DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE HAVE THIS

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:23.823
YEAR.

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:25.959
SO THIS IS THIS IS GONNA BE

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.260
UNFORTUNATELY --

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:30.063
DRIVEN BY WHAT WE CAN LEARN HOW

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:32.165
QUICKLY CAN OR NOT BECAUSE WE

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:33.233
WANT TO DO THOSE THINGS ARE

01:54:33.299 --> 01:54:34.601
AFFECTED WE ACT AS A SAID.

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.102
WE COULD DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:37.437
SOME OF THEM PROBABLY WOULDN'T

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:39.272
BE AS IMPORTANT THIS THING SO

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.207
THAT WE DO THAT WORK I I GET I

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:42.909
GUESS MY BASIC POINT IS THAT YOU

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:43.710
KNOW.

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.378
I AM CONCERNED THAT WHILE YOU

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.446
KNOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:47.513
DEVELOPING THESE WHAT FOR

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.315
MITIGATION PLANS THROUGH SB NINE

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:51.751
A ONE IN THE THAT.

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.386
THAT IF IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:54.854
THE ENFORCEMENT AND WE WE OFTEN

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:56.756
SEE THAT TO YOU KNOW THE LAWS

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:58.024
THAT WE PASS ARE MEANINGLESS

01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:01.961
UNLESS THEY'RE ENFORCED.

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:04.297
AND YOU KNOW.

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:06.899
IT'S THE STATE I I IMAGINE

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:07.934
ACCORDING TO YOUR YOUR ANNUAL

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:09.068
REPORT THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.803
DIVISION OF COURSE IS NOT JUST

01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:12.772
SURVEYING THE OVER TWO AND A FEW

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:14.807
THOUSAND MILES OF OF OF POWER

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.042
LINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:17.110
BUT IT'S ALSO.

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:18.544
SUPPOSED TO BE MONITORING OUR OR

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:21.648
GAS FACILITIES AND AND AND AND

01:55:21.714 --> 01:55:23.016
THE LONG LIST OF RARE ROSE --

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:26.586
LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT HIGHWAY --

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:30.123
AND YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS TO ME

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.391
THAT AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:33.526
NEW ABNORMAL OF THAT IS CLIMATE

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:37.430
CHANGE HERE THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:37.630
CAN'T.

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:40.133
WE LIKE THE ARTICLE TALKS ABOUT

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.100
I MEAN DO WE NEED TO DO WE NEED

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:42.335
TO BE LOOKING AT NEW MODELS OF

01:55:42.402 --> 01:55:43.469
RATHER THAN JUST ADDING

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:45.505
CONTRACTORS TO THE PC OF ME DOES

01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:46.205
THE PC.

01:55:46.272 --> 01:55:47.640
I HAVE TOO MUCH ON HIS PLATE

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:49.108
THAT WE NEEDED A NEW SPECIAL

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:51.944
AGENCY TO FOCUS ON ON WHAT FAR

01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:52.812
SAFETY AND MAIN.

01:55:52.879 --> 01:55:56.215
A MAIN TO I I THINK WE NEED --

01:55:56.282 --> 01:56:00.720
YOU KNOW WE WE NEED YOUR ADVICE --

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:03.289
YOU KNOW --

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:05.224
CRISIS THIS NEW ABNORMAL THAT IS

01:56:05.291 --> 01:56:06.159
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:56:06.225 --> 01:56:07.160
WELL THESE ARE ALL REAL GOOD

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:08.728
QUESTIONS BUT SOME OF THESE

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.563
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:13.032
OF OUR DIRECT ROLE SO.

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:14.467
I THINK THAT IS A STATEWIDE

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:16.469
WARNING SYSTEM IS A GREAT IDEA

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:18.571
WE TALKED A TO THE OTHER STATE

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:20.473
AGENCIES DO THAT WE DON'T DO

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.508
BORING EXIT THE CPUC NOR DO I

01:56:22.575 --> 01:56:23.943
THINK THE UTILITIES ARE THE BEST

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:25.244
PEOPLE TO DO WARNINGS.

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:27.046
WE HAVE TO GET MORE COOPERATION

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:28.748
FROM THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.116
THEY HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THAT

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.884
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE THE

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:33.419
DATA ON THAT.

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:35.288
PARTICULAR HAZARD AND OTHER

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:36.956
HAZARDS I'D IN A I WANT TO SAY

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:37.824
THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:41.627
NEED TO TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:42.195
FOR AND I CAN SAY THAT WE

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:43.996
ACTUALLY HAVE STAFF WHO DO SOME

01:56:44.063 --> 01:56:45.098
OF THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:46.899
RAISED AND YOU CAN TALK TO THE

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:48.301
TO THE OTHER STAFF THAT WE HAVE --

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:50.403
DO OTHER HAZARDS YEAH JUST WHAT

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:51.671
THE COMMENTS ON THE ON THE STAFF

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:54.540
AUGMENTATION THIS IS BY NO MEANS.

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:56.476
THE SOLUTION TO THE WELFARE

01:56:56.542 --> 01:56:57.243
CRISIS.

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.011
EITHER WE NEED SHORT MEDIUM AND

01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:00.680
LONG TERM --

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:03.716
EFFORTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM OF

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:04.984
THIS STAFF AUGMENTATION IS A

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:07.587
RESPONSE. TO THE TO THE

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:09.922
IMMEDIATE NEED TO HAVE MORE EYES

01:57:09.989 --> 01:57:10.990
ON THE GROUND --

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.125
AND WE CAN GAUGE THE

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:13.893
EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT AS ABOUT

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.229
WORK L. HAPPENS SB NINE NO ONE

01:57:16.295 --> 01:57:18.364
ANTICIPATED THE THIRD IN THE

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:19.699
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY TO COME

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:21.401
IN AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE

01:57:21.467 --> 01:57:22.702
OF UTILITIES.

01:57:22.769 --> 01:57:26.339
IT WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:30.109
WILD FIRE MITIGATION SET UP IN

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.077
TWENTY TWENTY ONE RATE WE HAVE

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:32.412
DECIDED THAT WE CANNOT WAIT

UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO.

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:37.216
THAT IS WHY WE'RE JUST BRINGING

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:38.851
ON ADDITIONAL PEOPLE OF SOCKS

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:41.120
FAST AS WE CAN JUST TO HOLD

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:42.822
BECAUSE WE CAN DO MORE WITH THE

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:43.856
HUNDRED THAT WE CAN DO WITH THE

NINETEEN RIGHT AS WE CONTINUE TO

01:57:45.958 --> 01:57:47.093
DISCUSS THESE LONG TERM

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.928
SOLUTIONS THAT CAN INVOLVE.

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:51.130
A YOU KNOW A SINGLE KINDS OF

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:53.399
PAST WEATHER IS CREATING NEW AND

01:57:53.466 --> 01:57:57.336
CITIES OR OF MEN SAYING --

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.839
ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAMS

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:00.139
[inaudible]

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:04.410
I THINK --

01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:06.546
YEAH.

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:09.248
THAT SEGMENT AND THIS MAY SEND

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.349
AN UPBEAT AND KIND OF ON THE

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:14.821
SAME LINES OF OF DOCTOR WOULD --

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:15.822
AND AND I'VE SAID FOR YEARS I

01:58:15.888 --> 01:58:17.390
THINK WE ASK YOU TO DO I MEAN WE

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:18.691
WE PILE THINGSON AND THEN GET

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.259
ANGRY WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK OUT --

01:58:20.326 --> 01:58:22.428
DO YOU AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:24.797
ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND LOOKING

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:26.065
IMPORTANT.

01:58:26.132 --> 01:58:27.600
BUT IN YOUR PLANNING PROCESSES

01:58:27.667 --> 01:58:28.935
AND AND FROM THE WELFARE

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:31.537
MITIGATION PLANS DO YOU ALSO

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:33.072
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE NIMBLE.

01:58:33.139 --> 01:58:34.474
I DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE I

01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:36.275
MEAN CALIFORNIA IS A BIG STATE

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:37.310
WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:38.644
TERRAIN AND DIFFERENT RISK

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:41.747
FACTORS AND DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

01:58:41.814 --> 01:58:43.282
FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE.

01:58:43.349 --> 01:58:45.818
IN YOUR IN YOUR ROLE DO YOU ALSO

01:58:45.885 --> 01:58:47.887
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE AS NIMBLE

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:50.590
AS AS YOU NEED TO BE AND IF

01:58:50.656 --> 01:58:51.824
YOU'RE NOT WHAT WOULD THAT WOULD

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:53.426
THAT LOOK LIKE.

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:54.594
SO.

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.363
I WILL SAY THAT I DON'T AND I'VE

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:58.798
ALWAYS SAID THAT HE DIDN'T THINK

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.399
THAT THE CPUC WAS THE MOST

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.401
NIMBLE.

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:05.037
OR EVEN TIMELY.

01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:07.139
AGENCY AND WE WERE DESIGNED

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:08.975
DIFFERENT --

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.910
ERA.

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:13.312
WHEN THINGS DIDN'T MOVE QUICKLY

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:14.881
AND WE WERE DESIGNED FOR ANY ERA

01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:16.916
WHERE EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:18.718
SPECIALTY COURT?

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:21.087
SO I USE IT WE WERE.

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:23.322
REALLY DOES SORT OF SET UP IS A

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:25.224
SPECIALTY COURT TO KEEP A LOT OF

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:27.026
THESE RATE MAKING ISSUES OUT OF

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:29.629
THE THE THE THE STATE COURT

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:30.863
SYSTEM.

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:33.299
AND SOMEBODY WHO HAD EXPERTISE

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.967
IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:37.503
SO I'VE WE CAME EARLY TO THE

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:39.272
LEGISLATURE SEEKING TO HAVE

01:59:39.338 --> 01:59:40.673
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.709
CHANGE OUR OVERALL PROCESSES.

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:46.279
AND TO BE USED THREE DIFFERENT

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.080
KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS WE DO

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:49.549
ADJUDICATORY OR FORTUNES FOR

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:50.750
VIOLATIONS.

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:53.886
OF WE DO WHAT WE CALL OUR RATE

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.755
SETTING FOR IN THAT'S THE BULK

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:59.025
OF WHAT WE DO FOR THINGS THAT

01:59:59.091 --> 02:00:00.693
INVOLVE COSTS AND THEN WE DO.

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.729
ANOTHER SET OF HEARINGS THAT --

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:09.068
FOCUS ON ON ON WHAT'S A

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:10.136
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES WERE

02:00:10.202 --> 02:00:11.470
IMPLEMENTING.

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.372
I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AND

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:15.374
CAUSE A LEGISLATIVE WE THINK

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:17.610
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT GO

02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:19.779
FAR ENOUGH IN TERMS REFORMING US

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:22.915
IN TERMS OF THOSE PROCESSES.

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:24.417
SO THE LEGISLATURE.

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:25.918
DID ALSO MAKE THE JOB IN SOME

02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:29.021
RESPECTS A LITTLE HARDER BECAUSE

02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:30.856
THE EX PARTE REQUIREMENTS

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:32.592
SOMETIMES MAKE IT HARDER TO

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:34.193
ACTUALLY HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.461
PEOPLE FREELY.

02:00:35.528 --> 02:00:36.729
AND GET INFORMATION AS A

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:38.931
COMMISSIONER SO YOU ELY MORE ON

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:40.466
BUILDING THAT RECORD VERY

02:00:40.533 --> 02:00:42.268
PAINSTAKINGLY THAT'S THE

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:44.870
TRANSPARENCY THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.939
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:00:47.006 --> 02:00:48.808
NOTION OF TRANSPARENCY --

02:00:48.874 --> 02:00:51.510
BUT FOR US TRANSPARENCY IS DO

02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:53.412
YOU HAVE A RECORD PUBLISHED

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:54.814
RECORD THAT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:57.516
ACCESS TO WHICH IS WHAT YOU USE

02:00:57.583 --> 02:00:58.551
TO MAKE A DECISION.

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.519
SO SOMETIMES I SEE THINGS

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.388
RAYNAUD THINGS BUT BECAUSE IT'S

02:01:02.455 --> 02:01:04.757
NOT IN THE RECORD I CAN'T DEPEND

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:06.225
ON THAT TO MAKE A DECISION.

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:08.761
THESE THINGS ARE REALLY HARD TO

02:01:08.828 --> 02:01:12.198
DO IN THE FACE OF PATH OF OF OF

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:15.468
FAST PACED KNOWLEDGE IS THE CAN

02:01:15.534 --> 02:01:17.370
INNOVATE VERY QUICKLY SO WE CAN

02:01:17.436 --> 02:01:19.171
TAKE US A COUPLE YEARS TO GET UP

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:20.439
ON TO SPEED.

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:22.908
ON THINGS LIKE BATTERY STORAGE

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:24.610
DURING WHICH TIME BATTERY

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:26.345
STORAGE IS REALLY MOVING MUCH

02:01:26.412 --> 02:01:29.048
MORE QUICKLY THAN OUR PROCESSES

02:01:29.115 --> 02:01:31.484
AND THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.985
PROCESSES ALLOW US TO BECAUSE

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:33.853
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG

02:01:33.919 --> 02:01:34.553
NUMBERS.

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:36.188
AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:36.989
WE ACTUALLY SPEND THE RIGHT

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:40.059
MONEY ON THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGIES

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:41.894
OR WE DON'T OVERSPEND OR THAT WE

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:44.030
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:01:44.096 --> 02:01:45.031
NUMBERS.

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:46.532
THESE ARE ALL HIGHLY LITIGATED

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:48.934
THAT I THINK IS A CORE ISSUE.

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:51.604
IF YOU WANT AN AGENCY THAT CAN

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:52.838
MOVE MORE QUICKLY.

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:55.041
MAYBE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT KIND

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:57.109
OF AGENTS IF YOU WANT AN AGENCY

02:01:57.176 --> 02:01:59.111
THAT DOES WHAT THE COURT DOES

02:01:59.178 --> 02:02:01.213
WHICH IS BALANCES THE EVIDENCE

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:02.848
THAT COMES INTO THE RECORD.

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:04.684
AND BALANCES THE WORDS VERY

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:06.719
CAREFULLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:08.487
THEIR SPECIFIC OUTCOMES OF

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:11.223
FAIRNESS AND WE'RE GOOD AT THAT.

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:13.292
BUT IT'S IT'S NOT GONNA BE QUICK.

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.661
SECOND BE QUICK THAT IN TURN

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:17.663
MEANS THAT TO DO THESE THINGS ON

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.632
SAFETY WE HAVE COME UP WITH

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:20.900
REALLY DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:22.301
APPROACHING THINGS.

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:24.236
SO WE'VE TRIED A LOT OF THESE

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:25.571
THINGS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE

02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:27.106
WORKED PRETTY WELL BUT THAT'S

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:28.474
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY RETURN TO

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:29.809
HIS WILD FOR CONFERENCE.

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.677
IT'S A WAY TO BRING A LOT OF

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:33.779
INFORMATION AND THAT ALL THE

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:35.347
PARTIES WHO COME TO US IN A

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:37.183
PROCEEDING WOULD NEVER BRING TO

02:02:37.249 --> 02:02:38.084
US.

02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:39.685
AND SO WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.755
THOSE THINGS JUSTICE NEWER TO US

02:02:42.822 --> 02:02:44.657
AND IT REQUIRES US TO STRETCH TO

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.192
BE ABLE TO DO THAT STUFF THAT'S

02:02:46.258 --> 02:02:47.193
WHY I THINK.

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:48.294
THAT -- LISA

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.062
HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS ADDITION

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:51.297
TO THE ORGANIZATION WHICH

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.698
BECAUSE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.734
AND SHE'S VERY FAMILIAR WITH HOW

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.402
YOU KEEP PACE AND AND TECHNOLOGY

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:58.504
INNOVATION BECAUSE SHE DID A LOT

02:02:58.571 --> 02:02:59.605
OF WORK AND IT.

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:00.406
SO.

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:04.677
IT'S IT'S A STRUGGLE AND THERE'S

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:06.412
LOTS OF WAYS WE DISPLAY THIS.

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:08.447
WE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO REALLY BE

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.416
ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW ADAPT

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.318
TECHNOLOGY WERE COURT WORK COURT

02:03:12.384 --> 02:03:14.086
WE NEED TO HAVE COURT ROOMS AND

02:03:14.153 --> 02:03:17.189
LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO SEEN

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.858
DIEGO.

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:19.458
ALL OUR COURTROOMS IN THE BAY

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:21.227
AREA. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

02:03:21.293 --> 02:03:23.629
CAN'T HAVE THESE KINDS OF

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:24.864
PROCEEDINGS OUTSIDE OF THE BAY

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.799
AREA'S IS VERY HARD FOR US TO

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:28.567
GET THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS.

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.603
ALL THE PARTICIPANTS TO TO

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:32.004
ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:34.306
ANY AND TO KEEP AN EYE ON US TO

02:03:34.373 --> 02:03:36.342
MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR DEFINITION

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:37.643
OF TRANSPARENCY THEY WERE

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:40.246
BUILDING A RECORD AND WERE USING

02:03:40.312 --> 02:03:41.914
THAT TO FRAME OUR DECISION.

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:42.848
SELL EITHER A YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:43.916
THESE ARE ALL THINGS I SAID A

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:45.117
COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:47.019
TALKING ABOUT --

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:51.490
ABOUT THE THREE PHARMACY PSA --

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:53.626
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT --

02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:55.361
THAT THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:03:55.427 --> 02:03:55.995
QUIRK BROUGHT UP FOR KIND OF

02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:57.163
CHALLENGING ONE OF THE THINGS

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:58.097
THAT -- THAT

02:03:58.164 --> 02:04:01.300
THE LEGISLATURE DID HIS REQUIRE

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:07.173
TO TREAT AUTOMATICALLY ANY --

02:04:07.239 --> 02:04:08.741
BANKER INVESTOR FINANCE --

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:11.343
FOR ME TO GO OUT AND AND EXACT

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:14.713
WHAT THE IN THE COMMUNITY IS

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.248
SAYING SO THAT I CAN REALLY

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:17.416
INTERPRET.

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:18.918
TRULY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:20.519
PRINT VERSUS WHAT WHAT THEY

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.288
ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING FOR SO I

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:23.556
HAVE TO DO THAT THROUGH.

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:26.358
A STAFF WHO CAN TALK TO THEM SO

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:27.927
THESE ARE THESE ARE ALSO

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:29.895
CHALLENGES BUT IT'S IT'S USEFUL

02:04:29.962 --> 02:04:31.463
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE.

02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:33.532
THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:35.968
ACCESS TO ME. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:04:36.035 --> 02:04:37.269
SURE I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO

02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:38.470
THEIR POINT OF VIEW.

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:40.272
I DON'T I DON'T HAVE GOOD

02:04:40.339 --> 02:04:42.208
ANSWERS HERE EITHER AND I DO WE

02:04:42.274 --> 02:04:44.210
ASKED TO TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:45.144
WHAT WE DO.

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:47.046
USED TO HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.380
PEOPLE WHO WENT OUT WITH THE CHP

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:50.516
OFFICER EVERY DAY TO INSPECT

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:51.917
COMMERCIAL TRUCKING [inaudible]

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.686
WELL.

02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:54.753
THAT THERE'S TREES BEEN

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.889
DEREGULATED FOR INTERSTATE

02:04:56.956 --> 02:04:58.157
PURPOSES AND IT'S ALL INTERSTATE.

02:04:58.224 --> 02:04:59.792
SO ALL WE HAD WAS --

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:01.861
MOVING VANS THE LEGISLATURE DID

02:05:01.927 --> 02:05:04.230
TAKE INTERSTATE MOVING VANS AWAY

02:05:04.296 --> 02:05:05.764
FROM US BUT WHEN HE LEFT US WITH.

02:05:05.831 --> 02:05:07.266
VERY COMPLICATED NEW

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.001
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE VERY

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:10.970
DEMANDING AND VERY COMPLICATED

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:12.171
IF YOU THINK THAT.

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:13.439
THAT REPORTS OF RECENT

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:15.140
DEMONSTRATORS DISRUPTING OUR

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:17.309
HEARINGS OR ANYTHING WE HAD TAXI

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:18.844
DRIVERS IN SAN FRANCISCO

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:20.079
SURROUNDING OUR BUILDING AT

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.947
HAWKING BECAUSE THEY WANT US TO

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:24.984
KILL THE THE THE LIFT AND UBER

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:28.220
COMPANIES.

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:31.824
THAT SELL --

02:05:31.891 --> 02:05:34.793
THIS IS NOT EASY THERE DOESN'T

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:37.196
SEEM TO BE DESIRE TO DO THAT.

02:05:37.263 --> 02:05:38.664
IN PART BECAUSE WHEN THE

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:42.301
LEGISLATURE GIVES US A TASK.

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:43.369
IT SETS A STATEWIDE MARK.

02:05:43.435 --> 02:05:45.104
VERSUS A BUNCH OF DISCRETE

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.572
MARKETS AROUND SAY SO FOR

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:48.507
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU TOLD US THAT WE

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:50.509
WERE GOING TO REGULATE THE CABLE

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:51.744
COMPANIES.

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:53.279
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF AUTHORITY

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.880
TO TELL THEM TO DO ANYTHING.

02:05:54.947 --> 02:05:56.181
BUT THEY COME IN EVERY YEAR THEY

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.250
GIVE US A FORM THEY GIVE US INTO

02:05:58.317 --> 02:05:59.852
A SMALL FEE TO FILE.

02:05:59.919 --> 02:06:01.754
AND THEN THEY'RE NOT REGULATED

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.456
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAND FOR

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:05.624
MOST PART NOT BY US.

02:06:05.691 --> 02:06:07.626
SO THERE YOU COULD PULL SOME OF

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:10.562
THAT AWAY --

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:13.399
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THAT

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:16.368
YOU WANT TO GIVE UP ALL CONTROL

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.837
OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO THE

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:20.406
DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS.

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:22.608
CELL DEEZER DEEZER CHOICES THAT

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:25.511
ARE TOUGH TO MAKE WE CAN'T MAKE

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:27.379
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:30.783
IMPORT QUESTIONS THOUGH --

02:06:30.849 --> 02:06:31.684
THAT --

02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:33.986
WE'RE GONNA TURN TO MISS RAMOS --

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:34.987
BURKE.

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.322
AND THEN MISTER PATTERSON AND

02:06:36.388 --> 02:06:39.625
THEN WE'LL WRAP UP AND MOVE --

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:42.194
TO MISS ECHOLS AND GIVE HER AN

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:44.430
OPPORTUNITY MAKER PRESENTATION.

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:45.030
AND THEN WE'LL WRAP IT FOR THE

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:45.831
DAY.

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:47.566
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:49.134
THINK IS I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:51.704
ON DR EGGMAN'S COMMENTS --

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:54.373
I THINK WHAT SHOULD BE CLEAR SO

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.075
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO FAIL.

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:58.344
THERE THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE --

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.045
AS DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED TOO

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:02.081
MANY LIVES THAT DEPEND ON THE

02:07:02.147 --> 02:07:04.116
ACTIONS.

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.084
OF THE P. C..

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:06.318
UP.

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:09.021
AND IF WHAT WE ARE DOING.

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:12.257
WHETHER TO SB NINE A ONE IS MORE

02:07:12.324 --> 02:07:13.826
THAN CAN BE HANDLED.

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:17.496
WE WANT THINGS TAKEN CARE OF

02:07:17.563 --> 02:07:18.998
THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE.

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:20.933
AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS AT

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.268
THEIR HOUSE TO BE AGAIN HONEST

02:07:23.335 --> 02:07:25.971
DIALOGUE YOUR WEEK ARE NOT ABLE

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.406
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:29.441
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN

02:07:29.508 --> 02:07:30.876
NINE A ONE WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:32.578
MEASURES HARDENING THE GRANT

02:07:32.644 --> 02:07:34.747
ENSURING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:36.348
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.216
THEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:07:37.282 --> 02:07:38.984
MITIGATION PLANS THAT THAT WERE

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:40.619
MANDATING AND TO DO YOU ARE YOU

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:43.088
ABLE TO TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:44.423
DO YOU HAVE THE STAFF TO TAKE

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:45.724
CARE OF THAT WHAT MORE DO YOU

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:46.759
NEED.

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:48.360
UP AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:49.661
BRINGING IN --

02:07:49.728 --> 02:07:51.030
BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER

02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:52.664
COUNTRIES --

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:55.601
DOCTOR WOULD TALKS ABOUT CHILE

02:07:55.667 --> 02:07:56.635
WE HEAR ABOUT AUSTRALIA.

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:58.570
IF IF WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO

02:07:58.637 --> 02:08:01.740
DO IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:04.243
TAKE TOO LONG.

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:05.177
THEN WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:08.981
A WAY. TO DO THIS MORE

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:11.350
EXPEDITIOUSLY BECAUSE THERE'S

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:13.252
TOO MUCH AT STAKE WE HAVE LIVES

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:15.287
THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND WE CAN'T

02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:17.222
CONTINUE ON THIS PATH --

02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:19.191
ONE DOCTOR WOULD TALKS ABOUT THE

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:20.859
EIGHTEEN MONTH PLAN.

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:22.561
I I I DO RECALL.

02:08:22.628 --> 02:08:24.029
WHEN WE HAD THE SB NINE A ONE

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:25.864
HEARINGS AND THAT WAS PART OF

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:27.366
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED?

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:28.367
YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:30.169
IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING IS IS

02:08:30.235 --> 02:08:31.670
PASSED WE SAY THIS IS THE NEW

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:33.005
REGULATION.

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:34.373
AND WE HEARD ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.974
TAKES EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.109
IMPLEMENT THIS.

02:08:37.176 --> 02:08:38.310
THAT'S FRUSTRATING AND THE

02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:41.046
DOCTOR WOULD HAVE TO AND TO THE

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:42.848
FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST LOVED

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:43.749
ONES.

02:08:43.816 --> 02:08:46.385
THAT ISN'T A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:48.253
BUT WE ALSO AS DOCTOR EGGMAN

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.922
SAID WE CAN'T JUST.

02:08:49.988 --> 02:08:51.490
SO WHAT ALL ON YOU AND EXPECT

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:53.358
YOU TO TO HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:55.260
FOR EVERYTHING.

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:56.829
IN THE END DURING THE HEARINGS

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:59.932
AS WELL I ALSO SAID AND I I WAS.

02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:02.701
AS A FRESHMAN I SAID TO YOU THEN.

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:05.671
IF THERE IS LEGISLATION THAT YOU

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:08.774
WANT FROM US THE YOU NEED THAT

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:10.676
WE FOR US TO PASS DOCTOR QUIRK

02:09:10.742 --> 02:09:11.977
HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:15.080
TELL US WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS

02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:16.615
WITH YOU WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT

02:09:16.682 --> 02:09:18.917
IN THE END WE WORKED TOGETHER

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:20.185
FOR SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:21.186
CALIFORNIA.

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:23.522
AND AGAIN TO DOCTOR WOULD INTO

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:25.190
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE

02:09:25.257 --> 02:09:28.327
HAD THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES.

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:28.961
WE NEED TO FIND THE ANSWERS FOR

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:32.898
THEM.

02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:34.600
THANK YOU AYE I THINK THAT I'VE

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:36.235
SAID THAT WE MOVE MUCH MORE

02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:38.103
QUICKLY ON SOME OF THE ELEMENTS

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:40.038
IN SB NINE ONE PARTICULARLY THE

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:41.673
WILDFIRE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.142
MOVING QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:09:43.208 --> 02:09:44.776
WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLKS TO GO

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:46.512
OUT AND SURE THAT THERE'S

02:09:46.578 --> 02:09:47.846
COMPLIANCE WITH THAT.

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.548
BUT I WILL SAY THAT.

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:51.517
THE STANDARDS THAT WE'VE ADOPTED

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:52.918
IN THE STANDARDS THE YOU ARE

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:55.387
REQUIRING US TO IT HERE TO IN

02:09:55.454 --> 02:09:57.923
TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING SB.

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.625
NINE ONE MAY NOT BY THEMSELVES

02:09:59.691 --> 02:10:02.161
BE ENOUGH WE WE I THINK WE CAN

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:03.662
DO THOSE I THINK WE CAN GET

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:05.230
BETTER AT THAT I THINK WE HAVE

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.565
TO GET BETTER AT IT.

02:10:06.632 --> 02:10:08.100
BUT THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION

02:10:08.167 --> 02:10:11.170
PLANS ARE WHAT I DESCRIBED

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:12.671
EARLIER AS A CEILING.

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:13.639
WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO GO

02:10:13.705 --> 02:10:15.107
BEYOND THAT.

02:10:15.174 --> 02:10:17.209
AND SO THAT'S PART OF OUR

02:10:17.276 --> 02:10:18.944
COMMITMENT IS THAT WE'RE

02:10:19.011 --> 02:10:20.179
QUESTIONING OURSELVES.

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:22.648
AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT

02:10:22.714 --> 02:10:24.082
WHILE IT SB NINE ONE IS

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:26.318
IMPORTANT ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.886
BE ENOUGH.

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.621
SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M EAGER THAT

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:30.923
THE GOVERNOR IS ACTUALLY

02:10:30.989 --> 02:10:32.257
CONVENING THE OTHER STATE

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:34.326
AGENCIES BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE

02:10:34.393 --> 02:10:36.061
WILL ALL LEARN BETTER AS WE

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.629
SHARE INFORMATION WE'VE WORKED

02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:40.065
CLOSELY WITH CALLOW WE US IN

02:10:40.132 --> 02:10:40.432
WITH.

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:41.266
WITH -- WITH

02:10:41.333 --> 02:10:44.870
CAL FIRE.

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:47.172
THEY UNDERSTAND FIRES.

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:49.208
WE UNDERSTAND RATE MAKING.

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:51.143
WE UNDERSTAND PROCESS LISA VADA

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:52.778
HAS ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.046
TRYING TO LEARN.

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.614
I THINK THAT BRINGING THE

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:57.349
CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.284
AGENCY INTO THE DISCUSSION

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.420
BRINGING SOME OF THE OTHER STAGE

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:03.055
TO THE DISCUSSION WILL HELP US

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.224
ALL TO GET TO BETTER SOLUTIONS

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:06.358
ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE

02:11:06.425 --> 02:11:07.559
CURRENTLY DOING.

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.094
AND THAT'S WHAT MY MESSAGES IS

02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:11.296
THE WE NEED MORE WE NEED MORE

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.398
THINKING WE NEED MORE IDEAS

02:11:13.465 --> 02:11:14.766
BECAUSE I'M JUST AFRAID THAT

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:17.169
WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A CEILING.

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:19.671
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH WE

02:11:19.738 --> 02:11:21.340
NEED HOW TALL WE HAVE TO BE. TO

02:11:21.406 --> 02:11:24.009
ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE THESE

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:26.345
CHANGING CONDITIONS.

02:11:26.411 --> 02:11:29.815
SOME ARE BURKE.

02:11:29.881 --> 02:11:32.651
SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE TO

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:38.156
BUILD A QUESTION WHICH AND I AND

02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:40.993
AND BUT ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:42.394
QUESTION WHICH IS.

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:43.562
I'M NOT TOTALLY UNDERSERVED

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:44.696
UNDERSTANDING WHY WERE

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:46.298
REINVENTING THE WHEEL I MEAN FOR

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:48.667
YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID WE DON'T

02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:50.068
UNDERSTAND THE WORDS MEAN OR WE

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:51.336
DON'T KNOW FOR MANAGEMENT AND

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:52.070
VEGETATION MANAGER.

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:54.373
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:55.207
THERE ISN'T A STRONGER

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:57.409
PARTNERSHIP OR WHY YOU'RE THE

02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:59.778
ONLY AND STEVE.

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:02.080
APPROVAL.

02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:03.348
FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WHY ISN'T

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:05.250
THERE MORE WORK WITH CAL FIRE OR

02:12:05.317 --> 02:12:06.718
ONE OF OUR OTHER AGENCIES THAT

02:12:06.785 --> 02:12:08.453
ALREADY HAS EXPERIENCE IN AND

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:09.388
I'M.

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:10.489
AND AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE OF

02:12:10.555 --> 02:12:12.224
WILD CARD TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.792
WHO IS PROBABLY BETTER ADAPTED

02:12:13.859 --> 02:12:15.093
AND BETTER ABLE TO EVEN TAKE IN

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.561
THAT INFORMATION FROM THAT

02:12:16.628 --> 02:12:17.963
CONFERENCE. TO BE WORKING WITH

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:19.998
YOU TIME TO LOOK AT THOSE WILD

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:21.333
FIRE MITIGATION PLAN THAT'S MY

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.434
FIRST QUESTION.

02:12:22.501 --> 02:12:23.669
AND MY SECOND.

02:12:23.735 --> 02:12:26.371
QUESTION SLASH COMMENT IS --

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:28.340
WE'VE SPENT ON THE TALK VERY

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:33.612
BRIEFLY ABOUT AND I KNOW DOCTOR

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:34.246
BURKE MENTIONED BRIEFLY AND THE

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:37.416
CHAIR ISSUES AND I KNOW WE HAVE

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:38.684
A TENDENCY TO THINK THAT THAT'S

02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:39.885
ALL ABOUT MILLIONAIRES AND

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:41.153
BILLIONAIRES AND MEANWHILE

02:12:41.219 --> 02:12:43.121
CALPERS LOST SIXTY SEVEN MILLION

02:12:43.188 --> 02:12:43.789
DOLLARS.

02:12:43.855 --> 02:12:45.357
CAL STAR IS OFF FORTY MILLION

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.658
DOLLARS OF THEIR INVESTMENT

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.960
DIRECTLY OVER THE LAST MONTH AS

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:50.329
A RESULT OF THESE DOWNGRADES.

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:53.932
AND MIKE I AM CONCERNED AND THE

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.600
SECOND PART OF MY QUESTION IS IS

02:12:55.667 --> 02:12:57.769
THAT THE PC DID COME TO THIS

02:12:57.836 --> 02:12:58.470
BODY -- IN

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.706
SEARCH OF SOLUTIONS AS FAR AS A

02:13:00.772 --> 02:13:03.175
LIABILITY OR CONCERN LAST YEAR.

02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:05.410
AND AS YOU LOOK AT NINE A ONE I

02:13:05.477 --> 02:13:06.712
HEAR YOU KEEP SAYING THAT LED

02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.013
MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MY

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.314
QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE

02:13:09.381 --> 02:13:10.615
LEGISLATION.

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:12.417
DIDN'T WHY DID NINE OH ONE NOT

02:13:12.484 --> 02:13:13.985
GIVE YOU TO PROVIDE THE MARKET

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:16.254
THE STABILITY IT IT NEEDS AND IF

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.456
THAT IS PART OF YOU KNOW WHAT

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:19.424
WE'VE HEARD. FOR THOSE OF US WHO

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.525
TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY LONG

02:13:20.592 --> 02:13:22.294
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FOUR FIFTY ONE

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:23.528
POINT ONE WHETHER IT'S A MAYOR

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:26.431
SHALL OR WHAT DID YOU NOT GET.

02:13:26.498 --> 02:13:27.833
THAT WILL PROVIDE NOT JUST THAT

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:29.167
NOT JUST THE I'LL USE BUT THOSE

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.469
WHO INVESTED IN WHICH OUR

02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:32.738
TEACHERS AND STATE WORKERS.

02:13:32.804 --> 02:13:34.439
ALL THE STABILITY IN THEIR

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:36.341
RETIREMENT OR WHETHER THAT IS

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:37.709
RATE PAYERS.

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:39.745
TAKING ON THAT BIRD AND WE ARE

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:43.582
AS A COMMUNITY AND AS A STATE

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.183
TAKING ON THAT BIRD AND NOW.

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:46.952
AND WE STARTED LAST YEAR BUT IT

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:48.286
HAS CONTINUED.

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:50.722
AND WHETHER IT IS BANKRUPTCY OR

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:53.592
SAFETY FIRST WE ARE TAKING ON

02:13:53.658 --> 02:13:54.826
THAT BURDEN AND I AM GOING TO

02:13:54.893 --> 02:13:57.929
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU NEED FROM US.

02:13:57.996 --> 02:14:00.065
TO MITIGATE THAT DAMAGE TO

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:02.734
SOCIALIZE THAT THAT COST.

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.370
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN OR

02:14:05.437 --> 02:14:09.074
WERE NOT GIVEN AND I KNOW WHAT.

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:10.509
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:13.011
AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.079
POPULAR IN I'M NOT STATING A

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:14.813
POSITION.

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.515
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:18.550
CAN TELL YOU THAT THE INVESTMENT

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:20.085
COMMUNITY WANTS INVERSE

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:21.553
CONDEMNATION REFORM.

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.054
INVERSE CONDEMNATION ISN'T

02:14:23.121 --> 02:14:25.991
REALLY A DETERMINATION OF

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:27.626
WHETHER THE UTILITY DID

02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.227
SOMETHING RIGHT OR DID SOMETHING

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.162
WRONG.

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:31.530
IT'S A STRICT LIABILITY

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.498
PROVISION AND IT MAKES THEM THE

02:14:33.565 --> 02:14:36.401
FIRST PAY ARE EVEN BEFORE THE

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:38.670
SOME OF THE INSURERS. FOR ANY

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:40.806
DAMAGES THAT ARE CAUSED BY THEIR

02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:42.774
QUITMAN.

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.776
AT THE END OF THE PROCESS AFTER

02:14:44.843 --> 02:14:46.411
THEY SETTLED ALL THOSE CLAIMS

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:48.780
SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:49.314
YEARS LATER.

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:51.383
THEY'LL COME TO US AND SAY OKAY

02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:54.219
WE ACTED IS THE FIRST PAYER WE

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:55.720
KEPT US OUT OF BED OUT OUT OF

02:14:55.787 --> 02:14:57.456
THE COURTS WE JUST DID IT THAT'S

02:14:57.522 --> 02:14:58.924
WHAT THE COURTS LIKE ABOUT THE

02:14:58.990 --> 02:15:00.725
THESE KINDS OF STRICT LIABILITY

02:15:00.792 --> 02:15:01.827
PROVISIONS.

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.563
NOW WE NEED TO PASS THOSE COSTS

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:06.231
ALONG TO RATE PAYERS.

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:08.033
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE.

02:15:08.099 --> 02:15:11.269
THAT THE UTILITY IS BEING FAIR

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:13.171
AND REASONABLE.

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:15.474
IN THEIR IN THEIR THEIR REQUEST

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:18.210
THAT WE ALLOW THEM TO TO TAKE.

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:20.979
MONEY IN IN FROM RATE PAYERS AND

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:23.215
SO WE WE THEN APPLY A PRUDENT

02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:24.716
SEE TEST AND THE QUESTION IS DID

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.551
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU COULD

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:27.385
POSSIBLY DO.

02:15:27.452 --> 02:15:29.588
AND SO THAT.

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:31.556
THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION FIRST

02:15:31.623 --> 02:15:33.158
AND FOREMOST IN MOST FREQUENTLY

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:34.593
IS WHAT --

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:36.228
THE THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:38.063
SAYS THEY WANT.

02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.965
BEYOND THAT THEY'VE SAID THEY

02:15:40.031 --> 02:15:43.168
WILL THEY HAVE WON A NUMBER.

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:44.703
THEY ONE AND OUT THIS MUCH IN NO

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:47.405
MORE IS GONNA GO TO SHAREHOLDERS.

02:15:47.472 --> 02:15:49.107
AND THE I DON'T THINK WE CAN DO

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:51.009
THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:52.410
MUCH.

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:55.614
THE UTILITIES CAN HAVE TO PAY.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.383
RIGHT AND JUST SO THOSE ARE

02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.784
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE.

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:00.752
AND I UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE ON

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:02.654
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE UTILITIES

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:04.356
AND THE INVESTORS WOULD LOVE THE

02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:05.857
REMOVAL OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:07.425
AND WE ARE ONE OF THE LAST FEW

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:09.728
STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:09.895
IT.

02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:12.397
HOWEVER --

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:15.166
YOU KNOW YOU CAME TO US ASKING.

02:16:15.233 --> 02:16:16.935
FOR A DEFINITION OR AN

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:18.403
UNDERSTANDING ON LIABILITY AND

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:19.738
WHAT DO YOU WHAT AND TO GIVE

02:16:19.804 --> 02:16:21.273
YOURSELF SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:22.974
THAT SPACE MY QUESTION IS DID

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:24.543
YOU GET IT IN NINE OH ONE AND

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:25.844
WHAT PART OF NINE A ONE DIDN'T

02:16:25.911 --> 02:16:27.379
GIVE YOU THAT.

02:16:27.445 --> 02:16:30.448
SO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NINE A

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:33.585
ONE IS THAT WE SHOULD USE OUR

02:16:33.652 --> 02:16:36.755
STANDARD PROCESSES AND IN WITHIN

02:16:36.821 --> 02:16:40.792
THAT DO A STRESS TEST AND THEN --

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:44.496
FROM THAT --

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:46.398
GO OUT AND TO BE A PLAYER

02:16:46.464 --> 02:16:47.666
REASONABLENESS TEST.

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.434
UP TO A POINT AFTER THE STRESS

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.336
TEST AND ALL THOSE COSTS GO TO

02:16:51.403 --> 02:16:52.804
RATE PAYERS.

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:56.875
SO WHEN WE STILL BELIEVE.

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:59.311
AS A AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:02.180
YOUR INTENTION WAS THAT WE WOULD

02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:04.816
WAIT UNTIL ALL THE COSTS WERE IN.

02:17:04.883 --> 02:17:06.585
BEFORE WE PERFORM THAT STRESS

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.219
TEST AND ALLOWED THAT

02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:09.654
SECURITIZATION.

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:11.089
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BEGIN TO

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.991
RECOVER THE EXCESS COSTS ABOVE

02:17:13.058 --> 02:17:14.859
AND BEYOND WITH THE UTILITY

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:16.494
COULD AFFORD.

02:17:16.561 --> 02:17:17.529
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:19.531
UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:21.066
THAT THAT'S IT'S GOING TO BE

02:17:21.132 --> 02:17:22.701
CONTROVERSIAL EVEN AT THAT

02:17:22.767 --> 02:17:24.202
THAT'S THE PORTION THAT I THINK

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:25.170
IT'S GOING TO TAKE EIGHTEEN

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:26.671
MONTHS THE OTHER STUFF WE DID

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:27.305
FASTER.

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:28.440
THE OTHER STUFF STUFF THAT WE

02:17:28.506 --> 02:17:30.375
THOUGHT WAS DIRECTLY APPLICABLES

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.077
TO SAFETY WE DID.

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:34.412
THIS IS ABOUT OUR TRADITIONAL

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:35.814
RATE MAKING WORK* WERE

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.183
CONTINUING TO RELY ON WHAT WE

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:41.786
UNDERSTOOD WAS YOUR INTENT

02:17:41.853 --> 02:17:42.087
[inaudible]

02:17:42.153 --> 02:17:47.425
OKAY.

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:48.727
I CAN ON TO THAT A LITTLE BIT --

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:49.661
EVER RAND OFF --

02:17:49.728 --> 02:17:51.029
DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:54.099
ENERGY --

02:17:54.165 --> 02:17:55.266
BECAUSE THE COMMISSIONERS

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:56.835
BECAUSE OF X. PART PARTY RULES

02:17:56.901 --> 02:17:57.802
HAVE --

02:17:57.869 --> 02:17:58.970
DIFFICULTIES MEETING WITH THE

02:17:59.037 --> 02:18:00.505
RATING AGENCIES WE SET UP A

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:01.940
PROCESS WHERE WE WILL

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.108
PERIODICALLY MEET WITH THE

02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:04.242
RATING AGENCIES --

02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:05.610
IT'S IMPORTANT THE RATING

02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:07.379
AGENCIES UNDERSTAND --

02:18:07.445 --> 02:18:09.381
WHAT THE KIND OF THE REGULATORY

02:18:09.447 --> 02:18:13.685
THINKING OF OF VERY STATES ARE --

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:14.853
YES THEY BEFORE THE CAMPFIRE

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:17.288
COMMUNICATED TO US THAT

02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.556
SOMETHING WAS VERY VERY

02:18:18.623 --> 02:18:19.991
IMPORTANT TO DAM WAS TO

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.760
UNDERSTAND.

02:18:21.826 --> 02:18:23.561
WHEN THE STRESS TEST WAS RUN

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:24.329
WHAT?

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:25.697
NOT NECESSARILY THE NUMBER WOULD

02:18:25.764 --> 02:18:26.798
BE BUT WHAT.

02:18:26.865 --> 02:18:28.500
THE CRITERIA THAT WE WOULD USE

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:29.768
TO DETERMINE THAT NUMBER TO GO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.202
BACK TO THE STATUTE.

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:33.738
THIS STATUTE IS I DON'T REMEMBER

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:34.639
THE EXACT WORDS BUT IS --

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:37.275
VERY STATUTORILY WRITTEN AND ITS

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.411
LACK OF CLARITY IS NOT CLEAR ON

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:40.979
ON WHERE THAT THAT THAT STRESS

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.847
TESTS WHERE IT BEGINS WHERE IT

02:18:42.914 --> 02:18:44.315
AND EIGHT YEAH WHERE WHERE IT

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:45.250
GOES AND SO.

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:46.951
WE DID EXACTLY WHAT THE

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:48.486
INVESTMENT COMMUNITY WAS ASKING

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.455
FOR AT THAT TIME --

02:18:50.522 --> 02:18:52.090
WHICH IS TO SAY OPEN A

02:18:52.157 --> 02:18:54.426
PROCEEDING THAT WE WE THOUGHT WE

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:55.026
STILL THINK WE CAN DO IN A

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:56.494
FAIRLY QUICK PERIOD OF TIME

02:18:56.561 --> 02:18:57.829
WHICH IS TO SAY.

02:18:57.896 --> 02:19:02.367
HERE'S THE CRITERIA WE WOULD USE

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:04.803
WHEN WE APPLY A STRESS TEST --

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:06.104
WHAT WE SAID IN AND I THINK THE

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.072
BEST WE CAN IS A WHOLE WAS

02:19:07.138 --> 02:19:07.672
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AT THE

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:07.939
TIME IT?

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.742
WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:13.645
APPLY I NUMBER.

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:15.080
THEN ISN'T USED UNTIL THE

02:19:15.146 --> 02:19:16.448
UTILITY COMES FORWARD SEVERAL

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:17.649
YEARS FROM NOW WITH AN

02:19:17.716 --> 02:19:19.684
APPLICATION TO RECOVER THE FUNDS.

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:22.687
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME THEIR

02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:24.222
FINANCIAL SITUATIONS GOING TO BE

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:25.356
DIFFERENT --

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:27.125
AND MAYBE THEY COULD THEN AFFORD

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.093
TO PAY MORE MAYBE THEY CAN

02:19:28.159 --> 02:19:28.927
AFFORD DIFFERENCE YOU DON'T

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:32.230
WANNA SET A NUMBER OF TWO

02:19:32.297 --> 02:19:32.864
THOUSAND NINETEEN FOR A DECISION

02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:35.166
YOU'RE GONNA BE MAKING IN TWO

02:19:35.233 --> 02:19:36.234
THOUSAND TWENTY THREE BUT YOU

02:19:36.301 --> 02:19:36.801
CAN SET THE CRITERIA SO THEY

02:19:36.868 --> 02:19:37.535
KNOW THAT --

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:39.504
THE FIELD CHANGED A LOT AFTER

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:40.739
THE CAMPFIRE --

02:19:40.805 --> 02:19:44.142
IN THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT NINE

02:19:44.209 --> 02:19:46.077
OH ONE DEALT WITH TWO THOUSAND

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:49.280
SEVENTEEN FIRES DIFFERENTLY THAN

02:19:49.347 --> 02:19:50.682
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES.

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:51.249
IN.

02:19:51.316 --> 02:19:54.252
SOMEONE EVER QUIRK TO YOUR POINT

02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.353
EARLIER.

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:56.087
IT'S NOT SO MUCH MY

02:19:56.154 --> 02:19:56.755
UNDERSTANDING IF YOU GO LOOK AT

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:57.722
P. GENIES FILINGS IN THE

02:19:57.789 --> 02:19:58.957
BANKRUPTCY COURT YESTERDAY AND

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:02.127
THE DECLARATIONS OF THEIR CFO --

02:20:02.193 --> 02:20:03.928
OF WHAT THEY WERE POINTING TO

02:20:03.995 --> 02:20:06.397
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THE P. YOU

02:20:06.464 --> 02:20:07.866
SEE.

02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:09.701
WOULD BE UNABLE TO DO THE STRESS

02:20:09.768 --> 02:20:11.202
TEST IN A IN A CERTAIN TIME

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:12.637
PERIOD IT'S AT THE P. YOU SEE

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:14.806
WOULD BE UNABLE TO GIVE THEM THE

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:17.342
AUTHORIZATION. TO GO OUT AND

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:18.643
BORROW MONEY.

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:20.311
HEARD THE RATE PAYER BACK TERMS

02:20:20.378 --> 02:20:22.380
OF NINE A ONE AND I'VE GONE BACK

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:24.282
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND READ NINE A

02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:25.683
ONE AND I JUST DON'T SEE.

02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:26.751
THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:29.454
THAT WE COULD STATION THAT

02:20:29.521 --> 02:20:30.121
ACCESS TO CASH.

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:32.223
WELL.

02:20:32.290 --> 02:20:33.458
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US IN THE

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:35.460
PAST THAT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:36.761
I WILL SAY THAT.

02:20:36.828 --> 02:20:38.696
YOU DID TAKE CARE OF IT IN THE

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:41.199
CASE OF SAN BRUNO AND YOU COULD

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:43.067
HAVE TAKEN CARE OF IT NOW THANK

02:20:43.134 --> 02:20:43.835
YOU.

02:20:43.902 --> 02:20:45.937
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:48.306
FACTS I THINK MAYBE WE AT THAT

02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:49.541
CHAIR HOLD MIGHT WANT TO DISCUSS

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:51.242
THAT LATER ON BUT IT'S A VERY

02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.976
DIFFERENT SET OF FACTS.

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:52.777
BUT THEN.

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:54.379
THE QUESTION THEN OF WHAT NEEDS

02:20:54.445 --> 02:20:56.147
TO HAPPEN GOING FORWARD IF YOU

02:20:56.214 --> 02:20:58.349
LOOK AT WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES

02:20:58.416 --> 02:20:59.417
HAVE SAID IN THEIR PUBLIC

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:01.886
COMMENTS ON WHY THEY'VE SET THE

02:21:01.953 --> 02:21:03.588
VARIOUS UTILITIES WHERE THEY ARE --

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:05.824
IN WHERE THEIR UNCERTAINTIES ARE

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:07.458
IT'S NOT ONE FACT.

02:21:07.525 --> 02:21:09.294
IT'S NOT THE P. YOU SEE --

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.529
MOVING SLOWLY ON THE STRESS TEST

02:21:11.596 --> 02:21:13.798
APPLICATION --

02:21:13.865 --> 02:21:14.632
IT'S NOT --

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:16.968
AT NINE A ONE HAVING WITH THE

02:21:17.035 --> 02:21:17.669
TERM OF ART THAT'S BEEN USED OUT

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:20.205
THERE IS THE DONUT HOLE FOR TWO

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:20.738
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT'S THE

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:22.040
BALANCE OF ALL THE FACTORS BUT

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:24.142
THEN THE BIG ISSUE FOR ALL OF

02:21:24.209 --> 02:21:25.710
THEM WHEN THEY GO FORWARD.

02:21:25.777 --> 02:21:27.111
IS.

02:21:27.178 --> 02:21:32.617
NO MATTER WHAT WE DO I ABILITY

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:33.852
FROM THE WILD FIRES.

02:21:33.918 --> 02:21:37.388
THERE'S STILL THE QUESTION OF IS

02:21:37.455 --> 02:21:39.891
THE UTILITY AS LONG AS THERE'S

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:41.693
NOT SOME OTHER FORM OF COST

02:21:41.759 --> 02:21:43.962
RECOVERY OTHER THAN UTILITY OR

02:21:44.028 --> 02:21:45.864
UTILITY RIGHT PAIR --

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:47.999
THEY DON'T SEE THE UTILITY IS A

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:48.967
GOING FORWARD MODEL I MEAN SO

02:21:49.033 --> 02:21:51.002
YOU KNOW WE COULD FIX INVERSE

02:21:51.069 --> 02:21:52.103
COMBINATION --

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.105
FAR WE COULD PASS ALL OF THE

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:56.107
COST ON THE RATE PAYERS FOR

02:21:56.174 --> 02:21:57.675
EVERY WILD FIRE.

02:21:57.742 --> 02:21:58.676
AND I THINK WALL STREET STILL

02:21:58.743 --> 02:21:59.644
GONNA SAY THIS IS STILL NOT

02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:01.479
INVESTABLE BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:03.147
ARE GONNA --

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:04.249
DO IT --

02:22:04.315 --> 02:22:05.583
YEAH THAT'S SIMILAR PATTERSON

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:07.318
HIS SUGGESTED --

02:22:07.385 --> 02:22:08.553
IS THEY'RE JUST GONNA STOP USING

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:09.387
ELECTRICITY FROM THE GRID

02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:10.622
BECAUSE IT WON'T BE AFFORDABLE

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.023
I'M SO IT'S THAT BALANCE OF

02:22:12.090 --> 02:22:12.991
THINGS THAT ALL OF THESE

02:22:13.057 --> 02:22:14.525
AGENCIES IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT

02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:16.261
WHAT THE RATING AGENCIES ARE

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:17.362
SAYING NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

02:22:17.428 --> 02:22:17.829
IT'S LIKE THEY NEED A

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:21.499
SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY METHOD YEAH.

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:23.601
YEAH AND THERE I SUMMER SAY

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:24.469
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN VERSE

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:25.637
COMBINATION FIX BUT I DON'T SEE

02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:27.171
YOU ACTUALLY SEE THAT AS THE

02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:29.641
ONLY IF IT'S REALLY THE COMFORT

02:22:29.707 --> 02:22:30.508
COPPER YEAH.

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:31.376
I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:37.782
ARTICULATE BECAUSE HE CAN

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:40.852
ACTUALLY TALK TO PEOPLE.

02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:42.820
I HEAR IT THIRD HAND.

02:22:42.887 --> 02:22:43.821
FOR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:44.455
ACTUALLY.

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:45.957
BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:47.625
TO KNOW TO THAT AND I DON'T WANT

02:22:47.692 --> 02:22:48.826
IT CREATED THE BLUE RIBBON PANEL

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:50.428
OR COMMISSION THAT THAT'S PRETTY

02:22:50.495 --> 02:22:51.663
MUCH THE FOCUSES TO ADDRESS THE

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:54.432
ISSUE OF LIABILITY AND GOING

02:22:54.499 --> 02:22:55.500
FORWARD AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.168
NOW APPOINTED THREE MEMBERS OF

02:22:57.235 --> 02:22:57.702
THE FIVE MEMBER.

02:22:57.769 --> 02:22:59.504
PANEL AND I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER

02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:00.104
IN THE PRO TEM AS WELL SO.

02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:01.039
THAT GROUP AND I THINK THERE'S

02:23:01.105 --> 02:23:02.674
AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL BE

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:03.708
UP AND OPERATING.

02:23:03.775 --> 02:23:06.911
A SOONER THAN LATER MEMBER BURKE

02:23:06.978 --> 02:23:08.713
HAS BROUGHT BROUGHT FOR IN AGAIN

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.048
I THINK THAT FROM OUR

02:23:10.114 --> 02:23:12.583
PERSPECTIVE.

02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:13.584
DEALING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S UP.

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.253
DO STRIKE FORCED ALL THE

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:16.521
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT THEY ARE

02:23:16.587 --> 02:23:18.489
THEY ARE TAKING ON WORKING WITH

02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:19.691
THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES WILL

02:23:19.757 --> 02:23:21.292
ACTUALLY HELP US TO GAIN

02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:22.794
UNDERSTANDING BETTER FASTER.

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:25.330
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:23:25.396 --> 02:23:26.965
INSURANCE AGENCY.

02:23:27.031 --> 02:23:27.932
AND SELF THAT PART OF IT IS A

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:30.668
RISK POOL OR SOME OTHER VEHICLE.

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:32.870
THAT'S NOT GONNA COME FROM US

02:23:32.937 --> 02:23:34.539
GOT IT --

02:23:34.605 --> 02:23:35.506
MISTER PATTERSON YOUR CLOTHES

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:36.808
OUT ON THE QUESTIONS --

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:38.943
AND THEN IF WE JUST IT IS YEAH

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:43.214
CIRCLES IF YOU COULD.

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:44.549
IF YOU'RE STILL HERE OWNER.

02:23:44.615 --> 02:23:45.516
APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY --

02:23:45.583 --> 02:23:47.518
BUT IF YOU CAN START MAKING YOUR

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:48.686
WAY FORWARD NOT I DO NOT THANK

02:23:48.753 --> 02:23:49.354
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW THIS

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.888
IS RATHER BROAD QUESTION BUT I

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:52.857
WANT TO KIND OF DISTILLED WE'VE

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:55.159
BEEN HERE TWO HOURS HEARING --

02:23:55.226 --> 02:23:57.362
EVERYONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING --

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:58.997
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE.

02:23:59.063 --> 02:24:00.631
ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS THAT WE

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:03.368
HAVE THE DOWNGRADES THAT AFFECT

02:24:03.434 --> 02:24:05.103
THE COST OF CAPITAL --

02:24:05.169 --> 02:24:07.405
THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY P. G. ANY

02:24:07.472 --> 02:24:09.807
AND BANKRUPTCY BUT WE HAVE OTHER.

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:13.778
UTILITIES OF SIGNIFICANT SIZE.

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:15.713
A TERRIBLY STRESSED WITH THE

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:17.415
CIRCUMSTANCES SO.

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.851
THE ASPIRATION FOR SAFE RELIABLE

02:24:19.917 --> 02:24:22.487
AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY.

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:24.856
HOW IS HAT ASPIRATION REACHED

02:24:24.922 --> 02:24:26.891
WITH THESE COMPLICATING

02:24:26.958 --> 02:24:29.127
CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS THEY WORK

02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:34.632
ENTIRELY AT ODDS WITH THE GOALS?

02:24:34.699 --> 02:24:35.266
HERE --

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:36.768
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE

02:24:36.834 --> 02:24:39.003
SAME ISSUES FOR QUITE SOME TIME

02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:42.373
SO FRANKLY IF YOU RECALL TWO

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:43.841
THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE TALKING

02:24:43.908 --> 02:24:45.009
ABOUT.

02:24:45.076 --> 02:24:45.743
HOW THE UTILITIES WERE IN A

02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:49.547
DEATH SPIRAL TOP SOLAR UNF

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:51.682
ANYBODY REMEMBERS THAT?

02:24:51.749 --> 02:24:53.751
UTILITIES ARE STILL HERE RATES

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:55.319
ARE STILL AFFORDABLE TO THOSE

02:24:55.386 --> 02:24:56.954
ROOFTOP SOLAR COMPANIES ARE

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:12.823
AND THAT.

02:37:12.890 --> 02:37:14.358
THE CONSUMER IS NOT ONLY NEED TO

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:15.959
BE KEPT SAFE BUT THEY'RE

02:37:16.026 --> 02:37:18.495
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN

02:37:32.342 --> 02:37:33.443
CUSTOMERS DON'T.

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:36.547
FOOT THE BILL FOR ANY UTILITY

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:38.115
MISDEEDS.

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.783
WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE A STRONG

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:42.119
VOICE FOR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:42.719
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE

ON SAFETY AND AFFORDABILITY

02:37:48.592 --> 02:37:50.194
MATTERS.

02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:52.462
FINALLY A SIDE SEVEN ON THE

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:54.565
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:56.733
WE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN

02:38:00.637 --> 02:38:02.306
MANNER.

02:38:02.372 --> 02:38:04.007
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF

02:38:04.074 --> 02:38:07.044
WE REALLY WANT TO REDUCE THE GS

02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:09.680

02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:11.381
REDUCED THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND

02:38:11.448 --> 02:38:12.883
THE IMPACTS LIKE THE FIRES THAT

02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:16.119
WERE HAVING CALIFORNIA'S ONLY 1%

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:18.355
OF GHG EMISSIONS SO.

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:20.090
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

02:38:20.157 --> 02:38:22.492
ARE MODELS THAT OTHER STATES

02:38:22.559 --> 02:38:25.062
OTHER COUNTRIES CAN FOLLOW THAT

AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE GOALS.

02:38:29.399 --> 02:38:30.567
SO AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS OUR
