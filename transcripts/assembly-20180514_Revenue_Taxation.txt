THEY SUSTAIN HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN THE FILM INDUSTRY AND THEY SUPPORT ENTIRE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT KEEPING HOLLYWOOD IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I WAS BORN.

WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBERT CICCONE JUNIOR AND I LIKE TO THINK MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON. CHAIRMAN BURKE. AND CHU AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. WHILE I'M ONLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. I HAVE WORKED AS MEMBER OF LABOR'S LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN. BEING HERE TODAY IS VERY FAR FROM MY NORMAL WORKING DAY. BUT I AM GLAD TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA FILM AND TELEVISION TAX CREDIT PROGRAM TO PLANO. AND I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. PRODUCTION PEOPLE ARE CRAFTS BECAUSE PEOPLE AND TECHNICIANS THAT WORK BEHIND THE SCENES TO MAKE IT WHAT YOU SEE ON SCREEN POSSIBLE WE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU NEVER SEE OR HEAR ABOUT. AT THE OSCARS ARE AND THESE THERE ARE OVER. DOUBT HUNDRED DOLLARS CLOSE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF US LIVING AND WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE THE ONES MOST SEE DIRECTLY IMPACTED. WHEN A FILM OR TV SERIES STAYS IN CALIFORNIA OR WHEN IT LEAVES. I LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT THE WORK I DO. THE UTILITY WORKERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BRING THE SET TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE THAT DAY ON THE STUDIO LOT OR ON LOCATION AND TAKE IT OVER TAKE IT WHEN IT'S DONE. AFTER THE DAY IS OVER THAT MEANS WE START WORK EARLY MORNING BEFORE MOST OF THE CREW AND CAST HER ON SET AND EITHER BREAKING THE SAID DOWN. LATER THAT NIGHT OR EARLY THE NEXT MORNING. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SET AND SUPPORTING THE WORK OF OTHER CREW MEMBERS SUCH AS CARPENTERS ELECTRICIANS AND PAINTERS. CALIFORNIA'S UP TO ONE OF THE BEST LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD FOR FILMING THE STATE OFFERS DIVERSE LOOKS AND TERRAIN FROM MOUNTAINS TO OCEANS LAKES FORCE AND DOES IT WE ALSO HAVE MOST. THE MOST EXPERIENCED CREWS HOWEVER MOST DISHES DECISIONS ARE ABOUT. ABOUT WHERE TO SHE ARE DRIVEN BY WHERE WERE YOU CAN PRODUCE A FILM AT THE LOWEST COST. AND THAT IS WHY OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE USE INCENTIVES. TO TAKE PRODUCTION AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA. I GREW UP ON FILM SETS BECAUSE I FOLLOWING MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS. HE JUST RETIRED THIS YEAR AFTER WORKING IN THE BUSINESS. BUT AS A MEMBER LOCAL SEVEN TWENTY FOUR FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS ON TV SHOWS LIKE THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN AND DON'T SUCH AS BRUCE ALMIGHTY. I'M VISITING HIM ON THE SET OF JURASSIC PARK THE LOST ROAD SUBMITTED MY DESIRE TO MAKE WORKING IN THE MOTION PICTURE. INDUSTRY MY CAREER HOWEVER DESPITE HIS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. I'VE WATCHED HIM FORCED TO GO ON UNDER POINT OFTEN ON UNEMPLOYED UNEMPLOYMENT. WHEN SO MANY SO MANY PRODUCTIONS LEFT CALIFORNIA BEFORE YOU PASSED AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE. AND BROUGHT IT BACK VERY FEW LABOR HAS GOT ON THE AIRPLANE WHEN PRODUCTION LEAVES THE STATE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF US ARE LEFT BEHIND. SO JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WERE A LOTOF US LOOKING FOR WORK AND VERY FEW JOBS TO COME BY. IT WAS TOUGH TO SEE SKILLED WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVING IT SO HARD. I HAD BEEN VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I GOT HIRED RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE WORKED STEADILY EVER SINCE. BUT I WAS ALSO IMPACTED ONE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA. I WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO FIND WORK WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR DECADES ARE STRUGGLING. THEN IT'S ALL THAT MUCH HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE MEAT AND SO CALLED ROOKIES TO FIND WAYS INTO THE BUSINESS OR TO KEEP STEADY WORK ONCE WE HAVE FOUND A JOB I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO KEEP FROM GOING ON UNEMPLOYMENT. AND WHAT I SAW WAS THAT THE. WHEN THE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION IS GONE PEOPLE MY AGE CAN'T REALLY FIND WORK. NOW WITH SO MUCH PRODUCTION BACK IN THE END DOORS HAVE OPENED UP. I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO WORK ON A FEW INCENTIVE SHOWS SUCH AS ANIMAL KINGDOM. WHICH SHOOTS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA A FOREIGNER AND I'VE BEEN TO PLACES SUCH AS MULTI STATE PARK AND SILVER BRAND PRISON IN EAST LOS ANGELES LAST DECEMBER I WAS HIRED TO WORK. ON ONE OF THE LIVE TV MUSICAL PRODUCTIONS THAT RECEIVED THE CREDIT A CHRISTMAS STORY LIVE. WORKING ON A LIVE TO THE TELEVISION SHOW. WAS A A REALLY HIGH PRESSURE EXPERIENCE BUT AMONG EVERYONE WORKING ON THAT PRODUCTION THERE WAS A SPECIAL BOND AND PRIDE IN BEING THERE. AND WATCHING ALL OF US TOGETHER CREATES CREATE A SNOWY WINTER WONDERLAND. I WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE. MORE POINT OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW IN MY WORK INOUR BUSINESS PRODUCTION DECISIONS ARE MADE ONE OR TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE. CERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE IS NEEDED AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR. HERE'S OUR IS A JOB CREATOR THAT EXTENDS THE CURRENT TWO POINT OH PROGRAM SPEAKING NOT JUST FOR MYSELF. AND MY FAMILY BUT FOR ALL THE BELOW THE LINE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE MOTION PICTURE BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I MY NAME IS ZAKI WORTH I AM THE OPERATIONS MANAGER AT A COMPANY CALLED DTC LIGHTING A GRIP THAT NAME WAS DECIDED THIRTY YEARS AGO SO PLEASE DON'T BLAME ME FOR THE ACRONYM. LIGHTING AND GRIP FOR THOSE A FEW WHO DON'T KNOW IT OR YOU JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS AT THE END OF THE CREDITS BY KNOWING WHAT A KEY GRIP WERE BEST LAWYERS. THEY ARE THE TECHNICIANS THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF LIGHTING THE SET AND PROVIDING POWER. SO THE ELECTRICIANS PROVIDE POWER AND PROVIDE THE LIGHT IN THE GRIPS SHAPE THAT LIGHT OTHER WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT EACH ONE OF THEM CARRIES THE OTHER DEPARTMENT ON THEIR BACK BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE. I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TO SPEAK AND I WAS PART OF THE. EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE DISCUSSION FOR YEARS AGO I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN ASKED HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS MUCH BECAUSE MY COMPANY IN EMERYVILLE CALIFORNIA SERVICES THE BAY AREA. ARM. WELL WE ARE NOT AS LARGE OF AN INDUSTRY IS LOS ANGELES IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN IT EVERYDAY I AM WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY THRIVING. SMALLER BUT PASSIONATE COMMUNITY IN THE BAY AREA. I REPRESENT A NUMBER OF TECHNICIANS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WORK IN MY SHOP MY COMPANY IS VERY SMALL COMPANY WAS STARTED ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO. BY A TRIO OF MOTION PICTURE AND COMMERCIAL KAFIRS KAFIRS OF THE CHIEF LIGHTING TECHNICIANS. THAT HAD SOME GEAR AND DECIDED HEY YOU GUYS WANNA GET TOGETHER AND START YOU KNOW MAKING MOVIES AND STUFF AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED. IN ALMOST EVERY MAJOR AND A LOT OF MINOR PRODUCTIONS THAT COME THROUGH THE BAY AREA THIS INCLUDES A LOT OF STUFF THAT YOU GUYS HAVE PROBABLY SEEN THE CHRIS COLUMBUS MOVIES OF THE NINETIES. ARE LATELY IT'S BEEN DISASTER MOVIES IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE WANTS TO DESTROY SAN FRANCISCO ON FILM. ARE WHAT WAS FRUSTRATING UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS AGO IS THAT WHILE THEY WERE USING WONDERFUL COMPUTER GRAPHICS TO DESTROY OUR CITY THEY WERE ACTUALLY SHOOTING PORTIONS OF THAT IN. PRIMARILY VANCOUVER OR LOUISIANA OR ANY OTHER PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE A MORE LUCRATIVE TAX INCENTIVE. SO WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THEY COME TO OUR CITY FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS WHICH WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT WORK TO. TWO DAY SHOOT PLATE SHOTS BACKGROUND SHOTS AND THEN THEY WOULD SHOOT THE REST OF IT SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THE TAX INCENTIVES WERE BETTER. NOW IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS SINCE EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE PASSED WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION THAT'S COME TO OUR AREA. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE QUALITY OF THAT IN THAT THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR A DAY OR TWO THEY'RE COMING FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS IN FACT. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE HAD TWO FULL LENGTH SERIES IN THE BAY AREA. THAT BEING THIRTEEN REASONS WHY AND CHANTS AND THINK CHANCES AROUND ANYMORE BUT THIRTEEN REASONS ABOUT AARON AND COUPLE WEEKS THE SECOND SEASON. WHAT THAT'S DONE TO US OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN INCREASE IN THE WORK NOW MY COMPANY MAKES MOST OF ITS MONEY FROM COMMERCIALS AND PHOTO SHOOTS AND LIKE THAT AND STUFF LIKE THAT? VIS MAJOR PRODUCTIONS WHEN THEY COME TO TOWN OR VITAL TO US BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TRAIN NEW MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF TO UPDATE OUR INVENTORY AND IN AN INDUSTRY THAT. THE LIGHTING TOOLS ARE CHANGING EVERY MONTH NOT EVERY YEAR NOW WITH LEDS. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE THESE LITTLE CERTAIN NOT SURPLUS IS A FUNDS BUT THESE LITTLE BUMPS AND OUR INCOME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THE COMES FROM THESE LARGE PRODUCTIONS THAT DIRECTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCENTIVES. ARE NOW A PHENOMENON THAT HAS HAPPENED IS AS LA COMPANIES NOT BEING THAT FAR AWAY HAVE COME UP. AND THERE STARTED TO MOVE IN BUT I WOULD SAY THERE'S BEEN A NET GAIN CONSIDERABLY BECAUSE OF THIS. AND IN GENERAL THAT THE THE LARGEST THING I CAN'T OVER EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH IS THAT. VIS PRODUCTIONS EVEN IF FOR ONLY DOING A PORTION OF IT MY OWN COMPANIES ONLY GETTING A LITTLE PIECE OF THAT A THAT'S APPRECIATED BUT WHAT IT DOES IS MAINTAIN A CREW BASE IN THE BAY AREA WHICH IS IMPORTANT WITHOUT A CREW BASE. NONE OF THESE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO COME THERE AND A COMPANY LIKE MINE CANNOT EXIST SO EVEN IF FOR ONLY GETTING A PORTION OF THESE DIRECT INCENTIVE RELATED PRODUCTIONS. THE RESULT OF THEM BEING IN OUR AREA IS ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE TO MAINTAINING A CREW BASE AND WITHOUT THAT A COMPANY LIKE MINE CANNOT EXIST. I SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND I'D LIKE TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AS WELL SO THAT. A LITTLE BUSINESS SUCH AS MINE AND MY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EMPLOYEES IN THE ONES THAT WE EMPLOY WHEN WE SWELLED UP TO THE DUTIES PRODUCTIONS. THINKING TO TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT THE BAY AREA CAN ALSO CONTINUE TO HAVE A THRIVING PRODUCTION COMMUNITY I THINK YOU. THANK YOU LAST WITNESS. YOU. I OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE BODY AND AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS MEASURE CONSIDER NOT ONLY THIS MEASURE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER MEASURES BEFORE YOU CERTAINLY THERE ARE. IMPLICATIONS ON PROP NINETY EIGHT HERE IN THIS MEASURE ON THERE HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS TAX CREDIT ON THE IMPACT THE ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND IN SPITE OF THE MAYOR OF THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCING IN THE MAY REVISE A SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THEY'RE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEASURES RELATED TO TAX EXPENDITURES AND CREDITS MOVING THROUGH THIS BODY RIGHT NOW.

I CAN COME BACK. SO DO YOU HAVE YOUR WILL WHICHEVER POSITION. AT WITH IT WE HAVE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS AT THIS POINT REGARDING THE IMPACT ON PROP NINETY EIGHT OF THE MEASURE. OF HIM MOVING FORWARD IF WE CAN GET A LETTER FROM YOU. I THINK IT. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TALKED BURKE. BOB. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALDERON I THANK YOU FOR THE REVISIONS TO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BLOOM THANK YOU FOR THE REVISIONS. WITH THOSE REVISIONS I FEEL I CAN SUPPORT YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SCENE NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM APPLE ONLY DO I JUST WANNA MAKE A QUICK COMMENT MY. MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER ACTUALLY IS AYE ON SEE AND WE SPENT THE LAST TEN YEARS WATCHING THE DIFFERENCE WE SAW THE YEARS WENT ON NOT UNLIKE YOU OUR FAMILY WAS ALL TOGETHER AND THEN THE YEARS WHEN HE HAD TO LEAVE AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN NEW ORLEANS AND. PLACES LIKE THAT. AND IT'S CHALLENGING FOR NOT JUST WORKERS BUT FOR THEIR FAMILIES SO WITH THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE A QUORUM THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS APPROPRIATE TO APPROPRIATION THE COMMANDER I'M LIVING A FILE ITEM TWELVE. AB THIRTY SEVENTY TWO. MISTER CHIU WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. COLLEAGUES A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY TWO WOULD INCREASE OUR STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THIS TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST AND IN TURN WOULD LEVERAGE ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX CREDITS LOCAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS. THIS BILL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO MY A. B. THIRTY FIVE BILL FROM THE LAST SESSION AND I WANT TO THANK EVERY MEMBER FROM THE ASSEMBLY. OF FROM THE LAST SESSION WHO VOTED FOR IT REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. WELL LAST YEAR WE MADE REAL HEADWAY ON HOUSING THE RECENT TRUMP TAX CUT IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM THIRTY FIVE TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS TO THE TUNE OF REDUCING OUR FOR DOUBLE RENTAL PRODUCTION BY ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND RENTAL HOMES A YEAR. AND ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM ARE BILL ALSO ELIMINATES THE CAP ON INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CREDIT WHICH IN TURN FURTHER INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM TO INVESTORS. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WE LOST WITH THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT IN THE TRYING UP OF HOUSING BOND MONIES. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE EXPAND THIS TAX CREDIT AND LEVERAGE ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS WITH THIS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR INPUT AND I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO DO THE FOLLOWING SUNSET THIS. PROPOSED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR A INCREASE IN THE TAX CREDIT AFTER FIVE YEARS REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS TO PAY A DOLLAR FOR EACH TAX CREDIT. AND SUNSET THE ELIMINATION OF THE CAP ON INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS PURCHASING THIS TAX CREDIT AFTER FIVE YEARS. AND WITHOUT A LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. I'M KEVIN WILSON WITH ANOTHER CRACKING COMPANY WE ARE. NOT ON YOUR MICROPHONE IS NOT WORKING. THERE SWITCHED I THINK IT'S WORKING NOW. I MOVEMENT TELLS WILSON I'M A CPA WITH THE ACCOUNTING FIRM NOBLE GRAPHIC AND COMPANY. HOW WE SPECIALIZE IN? LARA AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE. BUT WE DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT NOW WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE. NEW FEDERAL TAX REFORM BILL AS. MISTER CHIU MENTIONED THE. FEDERAL REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. THE FUTURE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. ALLOWING INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS TO UTILIZE THIS STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. COULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO OFFSET THESE LOSSES ARE AND INCREASE THE PROGRAM FISHING T. BY UPWARD BY UP TO FIFTY PERCENT. ELIMINATION OF THE SALT PRODUCTION. AND THE FEDERAL TAX REFORM BILL. COULD RESULT IN THE CALIFORNIA. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL VALUE TO INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE. INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT. LOSING. A STATE DEDUCTION IN. THIRD LOWERING THEIR. THEIR CORPORATE. THERE THEIR STATE INCOME TAX LIABILITY WITHOUT RECOGNIZING A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THEIR FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY. SO. AS A RESULT OF THAT YOU KNOW WE COULD SEE INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS PAYING UPWARDS OF A DOLLAR PER EACH. DOLLAR OF TAX CREDIT WHERE IS RIGHT NOW THE CORPORATE INVESTORS. ARE PAYING MAYBE AROUND EIGHTY CENTS PER CREDIT BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THEIR FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY BECAUSE THERE. THE STATE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION. IS IS REDUCED ON THEIR FEDERAL TAX RETURN. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THE. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS ON THE PRIMARY BUILDING% PROGRAMS FOR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING IN THE STATE. THIS BILL NOT ONLY INCREASES THE TAX CREDIT BUT IT MAKES IT MORE WORKABLE SO THAT WE CAN BET WOULD SO THAT WE DO NOT LEAVE A FEDERAL TAX SUBSIDY ON THE ON THE TABLE. IN THE TEAR IN THE FORM OF TAX EXEMPT BONDS WHICH CAN WORK WITH FOUR PERCENT CREDIT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE STRONG SUPPORT A BILL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SILVIUS ALICIA ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN THE OFFICE OF MAYOR MARK PARENTS TRANSPORT THINKING. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEN IT WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. WE ARE STILL SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I DO OF THE ACTION WILL BE TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MAN. IN YOUR OPENING PUSH IT THANK YOU. LIVING TO FILE ITEM ELEVEN A. B. THIRTY TWENTY NINE DOCTOR ARAMBULA WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. FREAK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY I PRESENTE B. THIRTY TWENTY NINE WHICH LOOKS TO CREATE A NEW CALIFORNIA HIRING TAX CREDIT. LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SEVERAL BILLS WHICH CREATED THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA HIGHER TAX CREDIT. THIS TAX CREDIT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER UTILIZED AND A. B. THIRTY TWENTY NINE LOOKS TO CHANGE THAT. THE GOAL IS TO ALLOW MORE EMPLOYERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TAX CREDIT AND TO CREATE JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY STRUGGLE TO FIND WORK DUE TO THEIR PERSONAL HISTORY. LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED. VETERANS EX OFFENDERS RECIPIENTS OF CAL WORKS OR GENERAL ASSISTANCE AND RECIPIENTS OF THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WOULD BE QUALIFIED FULL TIME EMPLOYEES UNDER THE SPELL. WHICH IS THE SAME UNDER THE CURRENT HIRING TAX CREDIT. AB THIRTY TWENTY NINE LOOKS TO BE AN EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING NEW EMPLOYMENT CREDIT. IT WOULD EXPAND THE EXISTING CREDIT IN SEVERAL WAYS. BY GEOGRAPHY. INDUSTRY AND RANGE OF QUALIFIED WAGES. THIS NEW CREDIT WOULD BE AVAILABLE STARTING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN AND WOULD BE A THIRTY FIVE PERCENT RATE OF QUALIFIED WAGES SAME AS THE CURRENT CREDIT. SPENDING THIS TYPE OF HIRING INCENTIVES FOR CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLED TO FIND WORK IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS. GOOD FOR EMPLOYEES AND GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY. IN ESSENCE PART. THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING IT NINE AYE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE DARK ARAMBULA TO A CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WILL WE HAVE A QUORUM IT'S THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PASS THEM AND IT APPROPRIATIONS. I THINK YOU. WOMEN FILE ITEM TO A BE SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT MISTER STEINORTH WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. NO PROBLEM. AND. THIS MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE PRESENT FILE ITEM FIVE AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY NINE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY OF UP PRESENTING AB TWENTY TWO FIFTY NINE AND ALSO WELL. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE STAFF AND OTHERS FOR WORKING OUT WITH ME ON THIS WE APPRECIATE IT VERY VERY MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE PARENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH. WITH A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ASSIST WITH THE ASSOCIATED MEDICAL VERY A COSTS AND OTHER COSTS OF A STILLBORN CHILD. A STILL BIRTH IS THE DEATH OR LOSS OF THE BABY AFTER TWENTY WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. AND CAN OCCUR UP BEFOREOR DURING DELIVERY ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BABIES ARE STILL BORN IN THE UNITED STATES. WHICH IS MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS MANY DEATHS AS THE NUMBER THAT OCCUR FROM SINCE. IN MOST CASES PARENTS WHO EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH A MADE PREPARATIONS FOR THAT TRIAL BY BUT CRIBS DIAPERS HELL BABY SHOWERS ALL OF THAT WITH FRIENDS FAMILY EVEN THOUGH. THEY VERY WELL MAY HAVE CARRIED THAT THE BABY PASSED THE DUE DATE. THAT BABY WAS BORN WITHOUT A HEART BEAT EVEN STILL THE MEDICAL COSTS FOR STILLBIRTH ARE HIGHER. THAN THOSE OF A LIVE BIRTH THESE PARENTS THEN HAVE TO ENDURE A CONSIDERABLE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL EXPENSES. FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS AND GRIEF COUNSELING. THIS BILL WILL ASSIST PARENTS WITH ALL OF THOSE UNEXPECTED COSTS DURING A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. OF THIS BILL CANNOT TAKE AWAY THE LOS THEY'VE EXPERIENCED BUT IT CAN PROVIDE RELIEF FOR FAMILIES AT THIS MOMENT IN NEED. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MR GAVIN FERGUSON HE AND HIS WIFE WERE FOUNDERS OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION PHOEBE SPAWNED. ALSO WITH THIS IS THAT MRS AREA WEEKS WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES CHAPTER OF THE STAR LEGACY FOUNDATION FOR STILL. UP BORN RESEARCH. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WHY I SUPPORT AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE. THANK YOU ALSO REPRESENTATIVE PATTERSON FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY AND BRINGING SUCH A NEEDED BILL THE CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS KEVIN FERGUSON I'M A MORNING RADIO SHOW HOST HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN ONE A SIX POINT FIVE THE AND. MY DAUGHTER PHOEBE WAS DUE ON AUGUST SIXTH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. PHOEBE HAVE A TOTALLY NORMAL PREGNANCY OUR DOCTOR OFTEN JOKED THAT SHE WAS READING THE TEXTBOOK IN THEIR. THE DUE DATE CAME AND WENT AND WE ANXIOUSLY. WAITED FOR HER TO SHOW SIGNS THAT SHE WAS READY TO COME OUT. ON AUGUST ELEVENTH WE WENT IN FOR A ROUTINE APPOINTMENT. AND TO DISCUSS WHEN WE WOULD INDUCE WE JOKE WITH THE DOCTOR. WHEN HE CAME AND BUT WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD TROUBLE FINDING PHOEBE'S HEARTBEAT ALL JOKING STOPPED. AFTER SEARCHING FOR ALMOST A MINUTE. HE FINALLY HER HEART BEAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM THREE AT THE SIGH OF RELIEF BUT THE DOCTOR STILL LOOKED NERVOUS. HE TOOK MY WIFE'S WRIST ENCOUNTERED HER PULSE AND SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS PICKING UP WAS HER HEART BE AND NOT THE BABY'S. HE QUICKLY PULLED HER OVER TO ANOTHER ROOM WITH AN ULTRASOUND AND STARTED TO LOOK AT OUR DAUGHTER. AS SOON AS HE HAD HER ON THE SCREEN WE ALL COULD SEE HER LITTLE HEART WAS NO LONGER BEATING. HE THEN LOOKED AT US AND SAID THE WORST WORDS THAT ANYONE COULD SAY TO A PERSON. I'M SORRY BUT YOUR BABY IS DIED. WE WERE AT FORTY WEEKS WE'RE ACTUALLY PASSED FORTY WEEKS. EVERYTHING WAS FINE UP TO THAT POINT THERE IS. SCREAMING AND CRYING FROM US FOR MONTHS AND I'LL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS BUT NO THAT THE LEVEL OF GRIEF FELT FROM PARENTS WHO NEVER GET TO HOLD THEIR BABY. HAVE THEM LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH NOTHING IN THEIR ARMS LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH AN EMPTY NURSERY THAT THEY BUILT IS A PAIN THAT NO ONE IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE AND OFTEN SWALLOWS COUPLES HOLE. THIS IS WHY AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE IS SO IMPORTANT. SEE IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH THAT PARENTS HAVE TO SURF THE WAVES OF GRIEF FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES MORNING A CHILD THAT THEY WILL NEVER GET TO WATCH GROW UP. THEY ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED EXPENSES THAT ADD INSULT TO INJURY. FUNERAL COSTS. BURIAL OR CREMATION COSTS. WORKING AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE SO THERE IS A LACK OF INCOME IN SOME CASES. SOME COUPLES NEED TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE OUR TOWN FOR A BIT IN ORDER TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS AND BE ALONE. THERAPY IS ESSENTIAL WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING NOT ONLY GRIEF BUT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND IT IS OFTEN NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND FINALLY THE MOST ROBUST MEDICAL EXPENSES. TO PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF A BABY THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO BURY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES IN FOR MORTALITY. HAS SUCCESSFULLY DECLINED HOWEVER STILL BIRTHS HAVE NOT. THEIR MYSTERIOUS AND WHAT CAUSES THEM IS A NUMBER OF HIDDEN DANGERS. THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OUR DAUGHTER PHOEBE ELAINE FERGUSON WAS ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STILL BIRTH IN AMERICA. IT'S FAR MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE REALIZE AND PARENTS OF THOSE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND BORN STILL EVERY YEAR NEED HELP. MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY LUCKY PEOPLE WE WERE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THOSE EXPENSES BUT WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T. AND HAD TO CHOOSE WHICH CRUCIAL HEALING EXPERIENCE THEY WERE GOING TO BYPASS BECAUSE THAT. DOZENS Y. WE STARTED A CHARITY CALLED PHOEBE SPAWNED. WHICH AIMS TO OFFER GRANTS TO COUPLES WHO SUFFERED A MISCARRIAGE OR STILLBIRTH. SO THAT THEY CAN STILL GET THE GRIEF THERAPY THAT SO HELPFUL. MANY PARENTS LIKE I SUFFER FROM PTSD AND OTHER FORMS OF PSYCHIC TRAUMA AND MOST INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T COVER THE COUNSELING NEEDED TO HELP WITH THIS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO FINANCIAL HELP FOR US WE THOUGHT. WE'D HELP THE SAME WAY THE REPRESENTATIVE PATTERSON IS TRYING TO HELP AND RELIEVE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE. DEALING WITH THE LOSS OF A CHILD THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN SO MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD TO DO. IS THE WORST THING A PERSON CAN GO THROUGH SELL WHATEVER ANYONE CAN DO TO MAKE IT LESS TERRIBLE IS A BLESSING. YOU ALL HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT. PEOPLE LIKE US KNOW THAT NOTHING WILL EVER BRING OUR PHOEBE BACK BUT KNOWING THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HELP AND WILL NEVER FORGET HER IS MORE HEALING THE MOST REALIZE. NO GRIEVING PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MONEY AFTER LOSING THEIR CHILD AND WHILE TRYING SO HARD NOT TO LOSE THEMSELVES. I ANCHORED YOU TO PLEASE APPROVE AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE AND DO WHAT YOU CAN FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME AND MY WIFE. AN EFFORT LIKE THIS GOES MUCH MUCH FURTHER THAN YOU THINK AND CAN BE SOMETHING THAT HELPS IN A TIME WHEN THESE PEOPLE FEEL HELPLESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WHAT OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARIEL WEEKS AND I'M THE CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES CHAPTER THE STAR LEGACY FOUNDATION.

THEY TURNED TO US AND SAID I'M SORRY BUT THERE'S NO HEARTBEAT. IN THAT MOMENT WE BECAME A STATISTIC IN AN EPIDEMIC THAT NO ONE SPEAKS ABOUT. ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FAMILIES WHO SUFFER A STILLBIRTH IN THE U. S. EVERY YEAR. BASICALLY THE EQUIVALENT TO A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN CRASHING EVERY FIVE DAYS. THIS IS A STATISTIC THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IN FIFTY YEARS. WE DELIVERED SYDNEY BY SEE SECTION A FEW HOURS LATER TO A SILENT ROOM. THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED BROUGHT US IN DIGNITY AFTER AND DIGNITY. I STAYED IN RECOVERY AT CEDARS FOR THREE DAYS IN THE MATERNITY WARD LISTENING TO LIVING BABIES CRY IN THE ROOMS AROUND ME. THEY TAPED A LEAF TO OUR DOOR SO HOSPITAL STAFF WERE ALERTED BEFORE ENTERING THAT WE'VE LOST A BABY. NURSES WHISPERED ABOUT ME AND DOCTORS AVOIDED US COMPLETELY. AFTER I RELEASE MY HUSBAND WILL BE EMPTY HANDED OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. I SAT ON THE CURB TO WAIT FOR HIM TO PICK UP OUR CAR THAT HELD ARE PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED USELESS INFANT CARSEAT. AT HOME WE FACED A MAUSOLEUM NURSERY FILLED WITH FRESHLY WASHED CLOTHES TS EXPENSIVE FURNITURE THAT WERE WELL PAST OF THE RETURN WINDOW. LIKE ANY OTHER MOTHER MY MILK CAME IN AND MY BODY BLED POST SURGERY FOR SIX WEEKS. SOON FRIENDS AND FAMILY VISITS DRIED UP AND MY EMPLOYER INFORMED ME THAT MY SIX YEARS OF SERVICE TO THEM WERE OUT A CONCLUSION. PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T NEED ME ANYMORE BUT I THINK I JUST BUMPED THEM OUT. JUST LIKE EVERY PARENT AFTER THE DELIVERY WE OWE THE HOSPITAL FOR MY ANASTASIA. MY ACTUAL SURGERY THE RECOVERY STATE AND ALL RELATED COST. WE EVEN PAID OUR BIRTH DO LET CASSIE CHERNEY TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IN ADVANCE FOR LABOR WE NEVER GOT TO SEE. SHE REFUSED TO REFUND US STATING THAT WE DIDN'T GIVE TWO WEEKS CANCELLATION NOTICE PER OUR AGREEMENT. WE OWED OUR OBSTETRICIAN OVER TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR DELIVERING SYDNEY'S LIFELESS BODY. AND UNLIKE THE PARENT OF A LIVE BIRTH WE WOULD ALSO OWE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST FOR THE AUTOPSY THAT WE WOULD NEED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. WE OWED FOR FUNERAL AND CREMATION EXPENSES COUNSELING AND WE WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE XML A LEAF. NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF THE CARE WE RECEIVED WHILE I WAS PREGNANT WHICH WAS ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE TEN MONTHS. THROUGH ALL THE ADDICTING HE'S I FACED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE MOST TRAUMATIZING FOR ME WAS ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WHAT MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO OUR ACCOUNTANTS OFFICE TO COMPLETE OUR TAX RETURN ANY ASKED AS THE STANDARD QUESTION? DID YOU GIVE BIRTH IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO SAY NO. NO I DIDN'T HAVE SEE SECTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NO I WAS NEVER PREGNANT FIRST FORTY ONE WEEKS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND NO I DIDN'T AUTOPSY CREMATE MY FIRST BORN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORCE ME TO DIE THAT SYDNEY MARIE EVER EXISTED. TODAY I'M NOT ASKING YOU FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR FAMILIES WHO SUFFER A STILLBIRTH I'M ASKING FOR EQUAL TREATMENT TO PARENTS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HEALTHY LIFE BABIES. BESIDES PROVIDING A LITTLE RELIEF TO HELP OFFSET THE EXPENSE OF A STILL BIRTH WHICH COSTS MORE THAN A LIVE BIRTH. YOU WILL BE RESTORING A LITTLE BIT OF DIGNITY TO THOSE LIKE ME WHO FEEL AS THOUGH SCIENCE DOCTORS GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD HAVE FORGOTTEN US. I'M ASKING YOU TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT WILL NOT BENEFIT ME PERSONALLY I'M NOT HERE TO FORCE YOU TO DECIDE IF SAID HE WAS A BABY OR A FETUS I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M STILL APPARENT. LIVE BABY OR STILLBIRTH WE ARE ALL FATHERS WE ARE ALL MOTHERS WE ARE ALL PARENTS I GAVE BIRTH. I WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GRATEFUL IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HADN'T TURNED ITS BACK ON ME LIKE SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS FAMILY AND COWORKERS. NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO DENY THEIR CHILDREN'S EXISTENCE. I HOPE YOU ALL HAD A LOVELY MOTHER'S DAY. AGAIN I'M ARIEL WEEKS MOTHER OF TWO EVEN THOUGH I CAN ONLY HOLD ONE IN MY ARMS. THINKING. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MANY MISTER UNDER GREGORY AND FROM ALL GROWTH I'M HERE TO SUPPORT AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE. I PERSONALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF TWO BABIES AND A I KNOW FROM MY VOLUNTEER WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED SHARING PARENTS THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THOSE FAMILIES IN NEED AND FOR THOSE REASONS I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. I AM DRAPER NOW ON WHAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CALIFORNIA WHERE I AM VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS SAYS GOODS HE ADDED AS HE BEING EVEN STRONGER WITH A. PROFOUND BELICHICK PROVISION FOR THOSE WHO ARE POOR. I VENN UPDATE LETTER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MISTER PARIS WOULD YOU LIKE. I THINK I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE TESTIMONY HERE OBVIOUSLY OF THAT. THE TAX BENEFIT. CAN'T REALLY BRING BACK. STILLBORN BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN LIST SOME OF THE LOAD AND SO I WILL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK YOU MR KRAUSS AND I KNOW IT'S TAKEN US A MINUTE TO GET IT HERE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND I. AND WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON ON THIS MEASURE. CLEARLY I'M CRYING. AS A MOTHER WHO STRUGGLE TO HAVE A CHILD MYSELF AND I KNOW THE. HORRIBLE LOSS OF OF LOSING A BABY IN TERMS SO. A. I'M SORRY YOU'RE HERE I'M SORRY FOR BOTH YOUR LOSS BUT IF WE CAN HOPEFULLY LIGHTEN YOUR LOAD IN ANYWAY AND WE'RE HERE TO DO THAT SO. WITHOUT WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO PREPARATIONS. THANK YOU SO I DON'T THINK YOU. MISTER STEINORTH ARE YOU READY. MOVING TO FILE ITEM TO AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TODAY WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN PRINCIPLE CO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOBBY ARROW. THIS LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED REFORMS TO THE PORTABILITY TAX. HE IS ME TO PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA BY GIVING FLEXIBILITY TO CALIFORNIANS YOUNG AND OLD. SPECIFICALLY AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT WILL IMPROVE PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY BY ALLOWING STATEWIDE TRANSFERS. UNLIMITED TRANSFERS TO HOMEOWNERS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE A NEW ONE TIME TRANSPERTH FOR HOMEOWNERS UNDER FIFTY FIVE AND IMPLEMENT A BLENDED BASE FOR MORE EXPENSIVE HOMES. WE WILL NO LONGER LEVER SENIOR STUCK IN HOUSING THAT IS TOO BIG FOR THEM OR FAR AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES BECAUSE LONGTIME HOMEOWNERS FEAR MASSIVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PROPERTY TAX BILL. AND WILL PROVIDE OUR YOUNG FAMILIES WITH AN INCENTIVE TO GET INTO THE MARKET EARLY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THEIR FUTURES BECAUSE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS FOR MIDDLE CLASS PROSPERITY. LEGISLATORS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO BRING FORWARD INNOVATIVE CHANGES TO PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY FOR YEARS INCLUDING LAST YEAR MEASURE PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE THAT WOULD ALLOW STATEWIDE TRANSFERS AND WAS CO AUTHORED AND SUPPORTED BY YOURSELF MADAM CHAIR. WHAT SHIPPING WEIGHT HOUSING CRISIS IS NOBLE WE HAVE TO MAKE BIG CHANGES TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE? THIS HOUSING STAGNATION ISN'T GOOD FOR OUR MARKET ECONOMY AND IT ISN'T GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS. WE MUST OPEN THE PATHWAY FROM HOMEOWNERSHIP TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND TODAY I AM JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO INTERESTS FOR CARLISLE FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. SOME OF THEM ARE COMING YEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL WHICH I AM PROUD TO CO AUTHOR. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IT IS NOT A BAR PART. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND ONE THAT WE ALL NEED TO ADDRESS. I DON'T NEED TO ITERATE THE DIRE HOUSING SITUATION OUR STATE IS IN WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE CRISIS AND WHAT WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO GET CALIFORNIA OUT OF THIS SITUATION. EVEN WITH ALL OF THE LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR IT IS ONLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET AND WE NEED TO GET CREATIVE. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY EIGHT DOES JUST THAT. BY EXPANDING THE PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY WE CAN GET EMPTY NESTERS OUT OF THE BIG HOUSES AND FREE UP MUCH NEEDED HOUSING STOCK. FOR YOUNGER FAMILIES MANY HOUSES OCCUPIED BY IT EMPTY NESTERS AND SENIOR CITIZENS ARE TOO BIG. NEED LOTS OF WORK AND THE REPAIRS AND UPKEEP CAN OFTEN BE A BURDEN AND IF YOU'VE EVER DONE ANY PRECINCT WALKING YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU COME UP TO A HOUSE. THAT HAS A DRIED UP FRONT LAWN AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT NEEDS A GOOD PAINT JOB. AND YOU KNOCK ON THE DOOR THAT USUALLY A SENIOR WHO IS DESPERATE FOR SOMEONE TO COME AND VISIT THEM THEY'LL INVITE YOU IN IN THEY'VE NEAR THEY CLOSED ALL THE DOORS DOORS IN THE HOUSE DOWN IN THEIR LIVING IN. IN KIND OF THE LIVING ROOM WATCHING TV AND EATING ON ON TV TRAYS I'M THOSE HOUSES ARE IN DIRE NEED OF. OF UPGRADE AND. PAINTING AND I YARD WORK AND FRANKLY GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE INTO A SMALLER HOME AND TAKE THAT PORTABILITY ALONG WITH THEM WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM. NOT ONLY THAT BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DESPERATELY NEED. AT TAX RESOURCES AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS HOME WOULD BE SOLD WHICH IS. WHICH WOULD THEN PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. PROPERTY TAXES TO COME TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. ENTITIES IN IN THAT IN A NEW STREAM THAT WOULD. HELP THEM TO HELP THEM TREMENDOUSLY. SO BY ALLOWING SOME RELIEF TO SEE AT THIS THE EMPTY THE SENIORS AND THE AB EMPTY NESTERS CAN KEEP THEIR PROPERTY TAX AT THE SAME RATE WHICH IS A ALLOWS THEM TO DOWNSIZE. WITHOUT THE RESULT IN TAX INCREASE AND SO THE SALE OF ANY HOUSE GETS REASSESSED FOR PROPERTY TAX PURPOSES AT IT CURRENT SALE PRICE THIS BRINGS A NEW. INCREASED TAX DOLLARS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING. WE NEED TO MAKE MAKE HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE. AND MAKE SURE THAT DOLLARS FOB FLOW BACK INTO THE ECONOMY AND STABILITY FOR STATEMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESS IN SPORT. AS FOR CARLISLE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU ONE FACTOID. ALMOST THREE QUARTERS OF ALL HOMEOWNERS FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER HAVE NOT MOVED SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. THAT'S A HUGE APPLY OF HOUSING THAT WE CAN TAP IN WITH THIS LEGISLATION. I'M GONNA JUST. LEAVE IT AT THAT AND I WILL HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. BUT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN THIS OPPOSITION MENACES IN OPPOSITION. WATCH OUT. NOT THE FIRST PERSON THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME WITH THE DOOR TODAY. ZERO THE GOVERNMENT THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS AT INCLUDING A CS CNC TO YEAH ALSO LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS HERE WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. ON ANY TIME THAT WE'VE CONSIDERED IN A MIXED PENSION TO PROP SYSTEM SIXTIES BEEN VERY VERY CAREFULLY TAILORED. ON THIS MEASURE UNFORTUNATELY IS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPANSIVE ON ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING ANYONE ANYWHERE. TO EXPAND UPON THE BENEFITS AVAILABLE. UNDER PROP SIXTY WITH A REDUCTION OF UP TO ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OUGHT TO THE STATE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY TOWN HALL WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WITH PORTFOLIO TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF. CALIFORNIA. STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES MATH MACAULAY. A WE TWO WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. HAVE BEING THE* THE. THE LOCAL AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE THE BULK OF THE. ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. WHEN SOMEONE MOVES INTO THAT COMMUNITY. WE FEAR THAT THIS MEASURE WILL IN FACT JEOPARDIZES. VERY SERVICES THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO GET WHEN THEY. RELOCATED. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK I WOULD LIKE CLOSE MADAM CHAIRMAN OUT ALLOW MISTER CARLYLE TO RESPOND. I JUST WANNA RESPOND WITH REGARD TO THE PROJECTED REVENUE LOSS NO THE OTHER REALTORS OF SUBMITTED ALMOST A MILLION SIGNATURES. OF FOR INITIATIVE THAT LARGELY MIRRORS THIS AND WE RECENTLY MET WITH. OF THE ALEJO AND MANY THINGS WERE REVEALED IN THAT MEETING. UP THEY DON'T DO A DYNAMIC ANALYSIS SO. INCREASES IN CAP GAINS TAXES. INCOME TAX SALES TAX DOT MATRIX OR TEXT NONE OF THAT'S INCLUDED. THEY ADMIT THAT THERE'S BE A INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING BUT THERE CAN CALCULATIONS DO NOT. A ALLOW FOR ANY MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION SO WE THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN QUITE A BIT OF EXCEPTION TO THEIR. REVENUE ESTIMATES. I THINK AND AT WHAT THE REASON THEY KEEP TALKING TO THE CONSOLE IS BECAUSE THE ARAB LAST YEAR WE DID. ONE TIME FIFTY FIVE IF YOU'RE AN OLDER. THAT WAS DONE BACK IN CONSTITUTION AMENDMENT THAT SO YOU JUST YOU KEPT REFERRING TO SENIORS AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE CORRECTLY? RIGHT NOW AT THIS BILL SHOWS A FISCAL LOSS OF ESTIMATES POPPING OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO WE HAVE AN. IDEA WHERE WE POWER REPLACING THOSE WHO THAT WAS MISTER CARLYLE'S COMMENTS WAS THAT AND THEY'RE IN THEIR ANALYSIS IT IS MISSING A LOT OF ELEMENTS SO WHERE DO YOU THINK THERE ANNOUNCES FALLS MISTER CARLO. AS I SAID THEY DON'T INCLUDE INCREASE AYE AIR THAT FOOTAGE HAVE YOU DONE AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE LOSS WOULD BE. IN YOUR PURVIEW. BOB NO WE'VE NOT ESTIMATED THAT IF I COULD ADDRESS AT THAT WHEN WE LOOKED OUT. PROPOSITION SIXTY AND THEN I MOVED INTO PROPOSITION NINETY I'M THERE'S ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF FIFTY COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATING PROPOSITION. I'M NINETY AND A LOT OF THOSE COUNTIES BUTTRESS EACH OTHER AND SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD ABOUT EACH OTHER AND SO WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING AT SOME THE OTHER COUNTIES THEY WERE LOOKING AT FORGET EXACTLY WHICH ON A POLITICAL NAY NOW SAYS. THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT LESS THAN TWO TENTHS OF A PERCENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE PROPERTY TAXES WERE BEFORE THE JOINT PROP THAT PROP NINETY AND THEN AFTER JOINING PROP NINETY. THAT THEIR ARGUMENT ORIGINALLY WAS THAT THEY WERE ESTIMATING THAT PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO MOVE TO DESTINATION CITIES AND LIVING IN SIN MEDINA COUNTY THEY WOULD SAY OKAY A. LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO MOVE TO MAYBE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OUT TO PALM SPRINGS ARE MOVED TO ORANGE COUNTY INTO THE BEACH AREAS AND YOU WOULD HAVE CITIES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE PROPERTY TAXES MOVED INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES. THEY DO NOT FIND THAT TO BE TRUE OR ACCURATE SO I I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT ON WHOLESALE LEVEL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THIS IS EXPANDED. AND I DO REMEMBER HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH THAT WOULD TO A CLOSE OPEN RESPECTFULLY ASK DR THOUGH WHEN YOU HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. LIVING FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. AS YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES SEEKING TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IS AFFORDABILITY. THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TAX CREDITS IN PLACE TO HELP COVER THE COST OF PREMIUMS. FOR THOSE MAKING LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT OR IF. I FELT THAT FPL. HOWEVER FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHOSE INCOME EXCEEDS FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FPL THERE ON THEIR OWN. KEEP IN MIND FOR TO PERCENT OF THE FPL IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE CREATES A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE OVER THE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT FPL TO HELP COVER THE COST OF THEIR PREMIUM. THIS CREDIT IS EQUAL TO THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO THE LOWEST COST BRONZE PLAN FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT EXCEEDS EIGHT PERCENT OF THEIR MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL ENSURES THAT NO CALIFORNIAN SPENDS MORE THAN A PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. TOO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE OF PAIN FOR HOUSING TRANSPORTATION GROCERIES UTILITIES. OR BUYING HEALTH INSURANCE THE RESEARCH IT'S CLEAR IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND MOVE US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. AS YOUR ANALYSIS OUTLINES I'M HAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. YOU'LL FIND. TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT WITH THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF I LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR FIFTY NINE IS A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. BEST PAL ON BEHALF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA WERE PLEASED TO BE HERE IS THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. AS MISS FRIEDMAN SAID FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MAKE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS AN INDIVIDUAL OR SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS A MARRIED COUPLE. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES. IN. YOUR DISTRICT MADAM CHAIR I HAPPENED TO LOOK THIS MORNING A COUPLE OF VERY COUPLE WHOSE AGE SIXTY TWO WOULDN'T PAY BETWEEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR COVERAGE THAT HAD A SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH OF THEM. I THINK MOST OF US COULD REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO TRY AND LIVE ON SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN WE'RE STARTING OUT. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND AND PREMIUMS. IN THE BAY AREA THE PREMIUMS WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER CLOSER TO TWENTY THREE OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE FOLKS HELP PAYING FOR THEIR. HEALTH INSURANCE SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE THIS WOULD BUILD ON AN EXTEND THE HELP THAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS GIVEN PEOPLE. TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COVERED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE HAPPY TO SPONSOR THE SPECIAL. I MARK HURLBERT WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WE ARE A AND NATIONAL CALIFORNIA BASED SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE BELIEVE WATCH MENORES AND SMALL EMPLOYERS ARE CENTRAL TO HEALTHY LOCAL THRIVING COMMUNITIES. AND THEREFORE WE'VE HOSTED HUNDREDS OF WORKSHOPS HERE IN CALIFORNIA HELPING UNDERSERVED ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND HOW THE ACA ACTUALLY CAN SUPPORT THEIR SMALL BUSINESS. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS ACA HAS PROVIDED HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS MANY OF THOSE NEWLY INSURED WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS OR OUR ACTUALLY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR SOME. OR ENTREPRENEURS THEMSELVES THEY SHE HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL FOR CALIFORNIA SELF EMPLOYED FOLKS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SELF EMPLOYED CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE. AND ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION THE MEDIAN INCOME IN CALIFORNIA FOR SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS IS AROUND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT PUTS THEM JUST ABOVE THE CUT OFF FOR RECEIVING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE THROUGH A COVER CALIFORNIA OF THIS BILL WOULD HELP THOSE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MAYBE JUST OVER THE THRESHOLD. A BE ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE INCREASING AFFORDABILITY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO PURCHASE THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETPLACE WILL ALSO MAKE SMALL BUSINESSES MORE COMPETITIVE AS THEY'RE SEEKING AT A HIGHER TALENT. ROUGHLY HALF CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEES WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE NEW JOBS SINCE THE RECESSIONS. AND THE BUSINESSES HERE CALIFORNIA CREATING MOST THOSE JOBS HAVE BETWEEN ONE AND FIVE EMPLOYEES AND IS THE SMALL FIRMS THEY'RE MOST LIKELY TO BE UNABLE TO AFFORD TO OFFER EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE. AND WE KNOW THE REMAINING UNINSURED ROUGHLY FORTY FOUR PERCENT ACTUALLY WORK FOR A COMPANY WITH LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. AND AND A RECENT SURVEY FOUND THAT AFFORDABILITY IS THE DRIVING ISSUE AND SO THEREFORE BY EXPANDING AFFORDABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE CAN ENSURE THE MORE WORKERS OF THE SMALLEST FIRMS CAN ALSO AFFORD COVERAGE THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE BOTH THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THAT WOULD LIKE BECAUSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WE HAVE A QUORUM OH NO WAIT FIRST I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS AND. WE HAVE THE FORCES APPLIED A GREAT INDIVIDUALS MAKING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE DEFINE THE TERMS OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAM STANDARDIZED BENEFIT DESIGN. AND DEPENDENT. I REQUIRE COVER CALIFORNIA TO CERTIFY THE CREDIT CLARIFY THE CREDIT APPLIES TO THE CALENDAR YEAR. AND CLARIFY THAT THE CREDIT MAY BE USED FOR PLANS OTHER MEN A BRONZE PLAN AND YOU'VE AGREED TO ALL THOSE AMENDMENTS GOT SLIGHTLY ALRIGHT GREAT. THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU OFFER WEAVING TO FILE ITEM THREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN ITS AB NINETEEN TWENTY TWO. BUT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. I AM PLEASE RESENT AB NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVENESS AND INNOVATION ACT A BILL TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE TAX RELIEF FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING UNDER CALIFORNIA'S BURDENSOME TAX STRUCTURE. I JUST LAST WEEK THE GOVERNOR RELEASE THE MAY REVISION OF ITS PROPOSED STATE BUDGET AND ANNOUNCE THE SURPLUS OVER OF OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR ALONE. AND A NEW RECORD BUDGET AND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WELL THE SURPLUS IS BEING CELEBRATED BY SACRAMENTO. THE REALITY REMAINS THAT HARD WORKING FAMILIES CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH HOUSING COSTS ARE SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL WE HAVE HOMELESSNESS THAT IS RAVAGING OUR COMMUNITIES AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION THAT HAS GOTTEN WORSE. CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO PAY THE HIGH STATE PERSONAL INCOME TAX THE HIGHEST SALES TAX THE SECOND HIGHEST GAS EXPLANATION AND THE NATION'S ONLY FRANCHISE TAX ON SMALL BUSINESSES. IS BECOMING MORE MORE DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN OUR STATE. WELL CALIFORNIA NOW RANKS AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD YOU MUST PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT. OUR CON ME CONTINUES TO FAVOR CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE WHILE OVERLOOKING COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE ONES I REPRESENT. THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT NEED AND DESERVE. REAL TAX RELIEF. THE BUDGET SURPLUS TO BE PUT TO BETTER USE BY RETURNING AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT TO TAXPAYERS SO THAT THEY CAN PUT IT BACK INTO THE ECONOMY. THE SURPLUS CAN BE USED TO HELP HOMEOWNERS OR THOSE LOOKING TO BUY THEIR FIRST HOMES BY INCREASING THE HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION WHICH HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. EVEN AS HOUSING COSTS HAVE SKYROCKETED. WELL WE CAN USE THE SURPLUS PROVIDE RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BY REPEALING THE ANNUAL FRANCHISE TAX. THIS TAX EFFECTIVELY PENALIZES CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES FOR WANTING TO PROVIDE JOBS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THE CALIFORNIA COMPARED THIS AND INNOVATION ACT WILL BRING THESE IMPORT REFORMS SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER STATES. ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT SACRAMENTO'S MONEY IT IT BELONGS IN THE HANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO EARNED IT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY SUPPORT IS DAVID WOLF OF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOOT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MEMBERS THERE JUST THAT HANDFUL OF THINGS IN THE BILL THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON HERE MY TESTIMONY IN THE FIRST ONE IS THE HOMEOWNERS EXAM. MEMBERS THE HOMEOWNERS EXEMPTION HAS BEEN INCREASED SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY. CALIFORNIA IS FOURTEEN THINK COMBINED STATE AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES EVEN AFTER PROP THIRTEEN AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CONTINUED INCREASE INVOLVED LOCAL BONDS AND PERSONAL TAXES. AN INCREASE IN THE HOMEOWNERS EXEMPTION WHICH RIGHT NOW IS JUST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. WOULD GO ON WAY TO MAKE HUNDRED SHIP. MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE AND TO THE EXTENT THAT. AN INCREASE IN EXEMPTION MAKES OWNERSHIP HOMEOWNERSHIP MORE AFFORDABLE GOVERNMENT COMPLAINING PARTNER ROLE IN INCREASING HOME CAPACITY. NUMBER TWO AN INCREASE IN THE RENTER'S CREDIT IS SOMETHING WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE SAME REASON ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA RUNNER SPEND HALF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY RIGHT NOW. ON RENT ONE THIRD. IT'S LITTLE WONDER THEN THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A TWENTY PERCENT POVERTY RATE NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION AND IT'S ALSO LITTLE WONDER THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEFT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. JUST LAST YEAR MAINLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING. NUMBER THREE IS INCOME TAX RELIEF CALIFORNIA HAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST INCOME TAX IN THE NATION AND IT'S THE MOST PROGRESSIVE TAX IN THE NATION ALSO WITH NINE SEPARATE BRACKETS. RETURNING MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IS IMPERATIVE. MISTER FUNG MENTION THAT WE DO HAVE A SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND I THINK THAT EXACTLY HITS ON THIS POINT. WITH HOUSING ENERGY AND CONSUMER GOODS CONTINUING TO INCREASE WE DO NEED MORE DOLLARS PUT INTO THE POCKETS OF MIDDLE CLASS TAXPAYERS. AND THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT SO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THE WITNESS IS A SPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHAUN LOUIS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN TWENTY TWO IS IT WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOUSANDS OF STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKING FAMILIES IN THE STATE. IT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE BUT IT'S WORTH REPEATING THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ENGINE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BUT NINETY NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL BUSINESSES BEING SMALL BUSINESSES. HALF OF ALL EMPLOYEES ARE EMPLOYED BY SMALL BUSINESSES AND HALF OF OUR GDP IS GENERATED BY SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS CLIMATE IN CALIFORNIA. HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THAT CAN BE DONE STARTING WITH THIS BILL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO WITH SMART. TARGETED TAX REFORM SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR MEMBERS IN THIS IS COMMON FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN GENERAL. FILE A SOLE PROPRIETORS OF THE REDUCTION IN THE INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES WOULD BE DIRECTLY BENEFICIAL TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT FILE ASIL PROPRIETORS. SECONDLY THE MINIATURE FRANCHISE TAX IS A PUNITIVE TAX TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND ESPECIALLY BURDENSOME TO THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS. ARE WHO HAVE TO PAY THAT EVERY YEAR SO WE THINK THAT TAX POLICY SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF OUR PRIORITIES IN THE STATE. IF WE CAN AFFORD TAX BREAKS AND TAX CREDITS FOR BIG MOTION PICTURE BIG SOLAR WE THINK WE CAN PROVIDE TAX RELIEF TO THE ENGINE OF OUR ECONOMY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. REX DOT BEHIND WITH CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. NGUYEN. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE.

IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN A NARROW MAJORITY OF CONGRESS BROUGHT THAT TO IN AND IMPOSE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP ON THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. AT THE SAME TIME CONGRESS ELIMINATED PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS FOR DEPENDENTS AND REPLACE THEM WITH A LARGER STANDARD DEDUCTION WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE NUMBER AFTER TAX PRICE OF SATAN UP SERVICES AND RAISES THE AFTER TAX PRICE OF CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS? IN THE SHORT TERM WE EXPECT CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DECLINE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF NONPROFITS EXPECTS CHARITABLE GIVING TO GO DOWN BY AT LEAST THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS NEXT YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THIS FEDERAL TAX CHANGE IN THE LONG TERM WE THINK IT WILL BE HARDER FOR STATES AND LOCALITIES TO RAISE REVENUE THROUGH TAXES. WHO LOSES FROM THEIR SWELLED STUDENTS FROM THE PRE QUE TO PHD LEVEL AT BECAUSE EDUCATION IS THE NUMBER ONE SPENDING ITEM FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION OF CHARITABLE GIFTS? PATIENTS IN PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHICH RELY ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. AND FAMILIES THAT ARE RELIANT UPON SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT? THE BIDDY MASON GOLDEN STATE CREDIT PROGRAM IS AN INNOVATIVE WAY TO ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AT THE SAME TIME. AND IT BUILDS OFF THE FACT THAT CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS REMAIN FULLY DEDUCTIBLE FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT CONTINUE TO ITEMIZE BUT THAT RUN UP AGAINST THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR SALT CAP. IT ALSO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THE IRS IS TAKING THE POSITION BUT A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION IS DEDUCTIBLE AS A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT A DONOR RECEIVES A STATE TAX CREDIT. SO HOW DOES IT WORK A IMAGINE A FAMILY IN THE TWENTY FOUR PERCENT BRACKET. IT MAKES A HUNDRED DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO A QUALIFIED ENTITIES SUCH AS A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR A KEY TO TWELVE SCHOOL OR A PUBLIC CHARITY LIKE THE UNITED WAY. THE QUALIFY CHARITY WILL SAY THE UNITED WAY GIVES THE FAMILY A GOLDEN STATE CREDIT WORTH EIGHTY DOLLARS. THE FAMILY IS ACTUALLY FOUR DOLLARS BETTER OFF AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE IT GETS AN EIGHTY DOLLAR STATE TAX CREDIT AND A TWENTY FOUR DOLLAR FEDERAL DEDUCTION SO IT'S GIVING UP A HUNDRED DOLLARS AND GETTING A HUNDRED AND FOUR DOLLARS BACK IN. TAX BENEFITS. THE UNITED WAY TRANSFERS NINETY DOLLARS TO THE STATE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CREDIT BUT IT STILL TEN DOLLARS BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT GETS A HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE FAMILY. AND THE STATE IS TEN DOLLARS BETTER OFF BECAUSE IT GOT NINETY DOLLARS FROM UNITED WAY AND GAVE A TAX CREDIT OF EIGHTY DOLLARS. SO THAT'S THE ATTRACTION OF THE BIDDING MASON GOLDEN STATE CREDIT PROGRAM AT THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW MAKES IT HARDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO RAISE REVENUE BUT THE BIDDING MASON GOLDEN STATE CREDIT PROGRAM GIVES THE STATE IN NEW REVENUE SOURCE. THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW MAKES IT HARDER FOR NONPROFITS TO ATTRACT CHARTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS BUT THIS PROGRAM HELPS THEM OUT. AND THE NEW FEDERAL TAX LAW DEALS A BLOW TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THAT RELIED ON THE SALT DEDUCTION BUT THE PD STATE GOLDEN STATE AT THE BIDDING MASON GOLDEN STATE CREDIT PROGRAM PROVIDES THOSE FAMILIES WITH RELIEF. LASTLY I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THE CHAIRWOMAN FOR PUTTING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD I THINK IT CAN AND WILL BE A MODEL FOR HER THE OTHER STATES. IN ADDITION WOODS SUPPORT. AND OF. I'LL JUST BOMB BRIEFLY I'M ADDRESS SOME OF THE FEDERAL TAX LAW ISSUES INVOLVING THIS PROGRAM SO. HOW ONE STOP EMPHASIZING THAT THIS LAWS GROUNDED IN THE SAME TAX LAW PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERSCORE THE HUNDRED PROGRAMS AND THIRTY OTHER STATES THAT PRE EXISTED? DID CHANGES MADE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IN PARTICULAR THE PRINCIPLE AS DANIEL'S SAID IS THAT. FEDERAL TAX LAW DOES NOT LOOK AT HOW THE STATE. DOES NOT EVALUATE. A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE PRINCIPAL AND THAT IS HOW I ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED. AND IT IS ALSO THE PRINCIPLE WHICH UNDERSCORES S. B. TWO TWO SEVEN. FROM THE SENATE AS WELL AS BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. I'LL ALREADY SO THE QUESTION IS. BOB. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THIS BILL IN WHICH A IN RELATION TO THOSE PRINCIPLES AND RELATED TO THOSE OTHER BILLS? I IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT. THIS IS THAT ALL OF THESE BILLS ARE GROUNDED IN THE SAME PRINCIPLES AND THEY SHOULD ALL BE SUPPORTED ON THE HOW ARE THEY SHOULD ALL ON. NOT BE CHALLENGED. BY THE IRS ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S NOT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE ON THAT THEY MIGHT BE ON IN PARTICULAR COMMENTATORS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THERE COULD BE A DISTINCTION MADE BETWEEN. THE PRE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND THESE NEW PROGRAMS BASED ON WHICH ENTITIES RECEIVE BENEFIT AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER OR NOT THE ENTITY IS A GOVERNMENT OR SOME OTHER KIND OF NONPROFIT ENTITY OR AT LEAST NOT THE SAME AT. GOVERNMENT ENTITY. ACTUALLY GIVING OUT THE TAX CREDIT. NOW. ONE EMPHASIZE THAT THAT DISTINCTION ITSELF WOULD BE AD HOC AND NOT GROUNDED IN IN THE LAW WOULD ULTIMATELY. FELL I BELIEVE NEVERTHELESS IT IS. A PROPOSAL THAT IS OUT THERE AND ONE OF THE. REALLY APPEALING FEATURES OF AB TWO TWO ONE SEVEN IS THAT IT SIMULTANEOUSLY DOES SOMETHING EXTREMELY DESIRABLE FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. NAMELY BROADEN THE TAX BENEFIT TO A LARGER SWATH OF CIVIL SOCIETY. AND AT THE SAME TIME AS IT'S DOING SOMETHING THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BEEN UPON POLICY GROUNDS. IT WILL ALSO BE MORE ROBUST RELATIVE TO ONE PARTICULAR KIND OF CHALLENGE. THAT IS POSSIBLE ON THAT THE IRS MIGHT HARM LEVY AGAINST THESE OTHER KINDS OF PROGRAMS PASSED BY OTHER STATE. THE COURTS QUORUM. IF I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO HAVE A QUORUM. HAVE LOVED IT SECRETARY FICTIONAL ROLE. BURKE THEIR. ROBERT. BONTA. CHU GRAY CHIU. GRAY. MCCARTY MELENDEZ MULLIN.

WERE SUPPORTIVE WE WE ALONG WITH ALL ON PROFITS. IN THE UNITED STATES WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED AND REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THE FEDERAL TAX. REFORM EFFORT IS GOING TO HAVE. SPECIFICALLY FOR CHARITIES BUT THE IMPACT. ON DEDUCTIONS AND SO WE SEE. THE CREATIVITY OF THIS BILL AND THE CONSISTENCY OF IT WITH OTHER. RELATED EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN IN A BAND IN EXISTENCE FOR SOMETIME AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO EASE. BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW. FEDERAL TAX CHANGES FOR SOME PICS SOME CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND AND EXPANDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT NON PROFITS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SO WE WOULD URGE OUR AYE VOTE PLEASE.

CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO SERVE AS THE HEADQUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE LARGEST VIDEO GAME PUBLISHERS NOT ONLY IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THE WORLD HOWEVER. LIKE IT'S COUNTERPART HOLLYWOOD THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A LEAD IN VIDEO GAME EMPLOYMENT.

FURTHERMORE WHILE AVERAGE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY WAGES IN CALIFORNIA ARE STRONG. I IN FACT FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GREATER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND SECOND ONLY TO WASHINGTON THE GAMING DEVELOPMENT HUBS OF LOS ANGELES IN THE BAY AREA HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY. PRINCIPALLY DUE TO A HOUSING COSTS.
