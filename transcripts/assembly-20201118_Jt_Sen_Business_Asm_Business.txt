AND WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THEM TO PRESENT THEIR OPENING REMARKS. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. MORNING CHAIRPERSON GLAZER CHAIRPERSON LONG COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF. MY NAME IS GREG WILL BE AT THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE PART OF TRAVESTY PRESIDENT. YEAH I HAD THE HONOR OF BEING A PUBLIC MEMBER THE COURTS WERE LIVING YEARS. NOT MY TENURE ON THE BOARD I'VE BEEN PROUD OF OUR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO CONSUMER PROTECTION. THAT OUR ROLE AS A LEADER. THE BORDERS ARE CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY CHARGED WITH REGULATING THE BUSINESSES PEOPLE AND PRODUCTS THROUGH THIS DRUG SUPPLY CHAIN. UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS EITHER DISPENSED TO THE PATIENT BY A PHARMACIST OR PROVIDED TO. DESCRIBE FOR DISPENSING. THE VERY ABILITY REGULATION IS SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX ENCOMPASSES A MERRY OUT OF STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE SAFE AND EFFICACIOUS MEDICATION. IN ADDITION TO EVALUATION AND DISPENSING OF MEDICATIONS THE ROLE OF THE PHARMACIST IS A LONGER TERM CAMPUS EVEN GREATER PATIENT CARE SERVICE. OVER THE YEARS US POLICY MAKERS HAVE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE AND THEY OPPORTUNITIES- PHARMACISTS HAVE MORE FULLY USE THE EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE GAINED AS PART OF THEIR PHARMACY EDUCATION. SUCH EXPANSION IS BOTH APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO CARE. FOR EXAMPLE THE PHARMACIST NOT PROVIDE MEDICATION THERAPY MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INITIATE MODIFIERS AND DISCONTINUES THERAPY USED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PRESCRIBED. MORE RECENTLY PHARMACIST WE'RE GOING TO BE AUTHORITY TO FURNISH FREE EXPOSURE AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE REQUIRED THE BOARD TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS BY JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY. LATEST REPORT THEM WITH THE COLLABORATION OF STAKEHOLDERS EXPERTS IN THE FIELD IN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY REGULATIONS BECAME A FACTOR APRIL THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. JUDGE TIME WHERE ACTIONS YOU BIRDS THE BUS OF THE WAY. INCREASE ACCESS OR- AS THE NEW CONTINUES TO GRAPPLE WITH- OGUN DUNES THE BORDERS TO AMONG FOR APPROACH COMBAT WE HAVE TO. INCLUDING ESTABLISHING REQUIREMENTS YOUR INSURER BETTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES PROMULGATING REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING A PROTOCOL FOR PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH NALOXONE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIVERS EFFECTS OF A DRUG OVERDOSE. PROVIDING FREE TRAINING ON COURSE RESPONSIBILITY AND RELATED TOPICS AS WELL AS MORE RECENTLY WORKING WITH EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO DEVELOP AND MAKE VAILABLE A SAMPLE COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT INCREASING ACCESS POINTS FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. IN GENERAL SUCH AN AGREEMENT PROVIDES THE ABILITY FOR PHARMACISTS TO PERFORM DRUG THERAPY MANAGEMENT TO PATIENTS WITH OPIOID USE DISORDER IN COLLABORATION WITH PRESCRIBERS. I BELIEVE AN IMPORTANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE ACTION THE BOARD IS TAKEN AS PART OF ITS RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THE BOARD HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON ITS EXTRAORDINARY STORIES TO ISSUE WAIVERS TO PROVISIONS OF PHARMACY LAW AND ITS REGULATIONS. ON THE BOARDS. RELATED THE PROJECT OF THE PUBLIC IN THE PROVISION OF PATIENT CARE. IS RESIDENTS OF SORRY THE BORN INSTAGRAM QUICK ACTIONS I AM PROUD OF THE BOARD JACK. AND I KNOW THERE BEEN MEETING BASED ON NUMERO ACCOLADES WE'VE RECEIVED FOR OUR QUICK RESPONSE TO WAIVER REQUESTS. SIMILAR TO THE STATE'S RESPONSE REPORTS RESPONSES INVOLVED DURING THE PANDEMIC. PARTNERING WITH OTHER AGENCIES WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS. BEEN SIGNIFICANT. R. S. ARE ONGOING AND INVOLVED IS NATION AND CALIFORNIA RISK CAN DO. AND THE EVENTUAL JUST OF. ALL ROBERT MERRY MEN PLACE THERE ARE MEN JOHN YOU HAVE. YOUR CURRENT AMONG THEM MAY IT I'M OF THE BOARD. I THANK YOU THE ARE TO SHARE OF THOSE ARE DURING THE PAST FIVE. TO FULFILL CONSUMER MANDATE WILL FORWARD TO CAN OUR WITH A- THEN MINISTRY. AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WE FURTHER OBJECTION OF CALIFORNIA CAN CONSUMERS. THANK YOU FOR ACCORDING. OPPORTUNITIES BIG TIER NINE- AM I WANNA LET YOU KNOW HOW I'M NOT LINE IS SENATOR GRAMM. RECORD ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR THE AND MR GRAMM LOOKS YEAR TO NOW. AT YOU FOR THE TO- AND TODAY- AND ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD AND PRESIDENT LIBBY WE TRULY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BOARD WORKS DILIGENTLY TO RESPOND TO THE CLUB IN NINETEEN CRISIS. THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN BOTH- IT TO PROVIDE WAIVERS AS WELL AS TO TRANSITION BOTH ARE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND OUR STAFF HAD DEMONSTRATED RESILIENCY WE HAVE TRIED TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF THE IMPACTS THE BOARD IS TAKING TO ENSURE THAT WE BOTH. CONTINUE TO MEET OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION MANDATE WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICE TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GRAMM I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS TO PLEASE SO INDICATE SO WE CAN BE RECOGNIZED. ANY- MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. CARILLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR GLAZIER OD AND SPECIFICALLY TO THAT OF OUR BOARD PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND TO THE- IMPORTANT WORK OF THE BOARD ITSELF MUCH OF IT IS VOLUNTEER BASED AND AGAIN ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE. SPECIFICALLY TO THE ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED ISSUE NUMBER TWO WITH RESPECT TO BOARD EXPERTISE IT'S BEEN A DAY- BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE- WITH RESPECT TO- PRACTICING COMPOUNDING- THE THAT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF. SPECIFICALLY THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AN ISSUE NUMBER TWO- TO BE UPDATED POTENTIALLY TO REQUIRE WHEN THE PHARMACIST ON THE BOARD TO BE PRACTICING TO BE A PRACTICING A COMPOUNDING PHARMACIST- DUE TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND REYES AND AGAIN ISSUE NUMBER TWO. OF MY DAY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND BOARD PRESIDENT ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE AGAIN ISSUE NUMBER TWO. I THINK YOU- IN GENERAL I WOULD SEE THAT THE BOARD REALLY LOOKS FORWARD TO REVIEWING ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDING RESPONSES BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE THE BOARD ITSELF HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE- I WOULD SAY THAT IN GENERAL THE BOARD WORKS VERY HARD TO DO ALL OF ITS DELIBERATIONS AND PUBLIC PROVIDES A VERY ROBUST OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE AND ENGAGE. THE BOARD ALSO REACHES OUT TO EXPERTS AS WELL WHEN THEY BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NECESSARY- THERE ARE SEVERAL PHARMACIST POSITIONS ON THE BOARD- SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY- DEDICATED OR ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC POSITION SO I DO BELIEVE UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTORY AUTHORITY- SOMEONE WITH A COMPOUNDING BACKGROUND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY- FOR AN APPOINTMENT. BUT UNTIL THE BOARD HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY DISCUSS THE ISSUE IT DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THAT ISSUE. GREAT THANK YOU IT AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IF I MIGHT MISS CARE. THIS IS WITH RESPECT TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN- WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE RETAIL PHARMACY PENALTIES. ED SPECIFICALLY DOES THE BOARD BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE HARSHER PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF LAW ACROSS MULTIPLE PHARMACIES OPERATING UNDER COMMONOWNERSHIP AND DISCUSSED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AGAIN THE BOARD WILL BE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE IN MORE DETAIL- IN RESPONSE TO THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND WILL BE PROVIDING A RESPONSE IN GENERAL THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH- EFFECTUATE IN- COMPLIANCE WITH THE AREAS THAT SEEM TO BE MORE SYSTEMIC THAN A SITE SPECIFIC ISSUE. SO THE BOARD IS LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BE- IT SHOULD BE ADAM. TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE THE NECESSARY PATIENT PROTECTIONS PERHAPS IN A MORE BROAD SENSE THAN JUST AND A SPECIFIC SITE- AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE LARGE- RETAIL CHAINS AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AND- THE NATURE OF HOW WE CAN RESPOND TO THEM IS CURRENTLY THE SAME AND THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITY TO- ADD SOME ADDITIONAL OPTIONS TO ITS- TOOLBOX TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE ITS CONSUMER PROTECTION MANDATE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR LOW- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SENATOR PAN HERE IN THE CHAMBERS- THANK YOU- CHECK LATER AND- APPRECIATE- DISCUSSION I'D I'D COUPLE QUESTIONS- IN REGARDS TO. WAS PRESENTED IN THAT BACKGROUND PAPER- SO FIRST OF ALL- THIS IS A QUESTION GENERALLY ASK A LOT OF BOARDS- DISHING HEALTH PROFESSIONS ON CONTINUING EDUCATION I APPRECIATE THAT ACTUALLY- THE TEARS THAT COMPLIANCE IS BEEN GOING UP OVER TIME BASS AND- THAT- FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- THAT- THE NUMBER OF AUDITS THAT PERFORMED- HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY I DON'T KNOW THERE'S THAT REALLY TO COVET OR SOMETHING OR WHAT CHANGE IS AN EXPLANATION. WHY THAT FOR THAT SIGNIFICANT DROP IN AUDITS. IS STILL IN CARD- AS WE'VE HAD TO RE DIRECT STAFF IN SOME AREAS WE'VE HAD TO- YOU KNOW AND MAKE SOME. DECISIONS ON WHERE BEST TO DIRECT RESOURCES SO WE HAVE pHAD TO SCALE BACK OUR EFFORTS IN THAT AREA WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL- TO PERHAPS. USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLATFORMS TO CONDUCT AUDITS BUT UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO EFFECTUATE THAT IT IS STILL A MANUAL PROCESS. OKAY SO. JUST TO CLARIFY YOU SAID YOU HAD TO SHIFT STAFFS OF- IS THIS CHANGE WHICH BASICALLY GONE FROM SIX HUNDRED TWELVE I MEAN WE'VE HAD OVER SIX HUNDRED AUDITS FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. UNTIL THE PREVIOUS YEAR WORDS TO ONLY TWO HUNDRED AUTHORED. IS THAT A OF A PERMANENT IS THAT AN ONGOING CHANGE BECAUSE OF STAFF FIFTEEN HOURS- TEMPORARY EVENTS TO HAPPEN FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY WHERE WE HAD A- DROPPED BY A THIRD MY EXTRA TWO THIRDS OF WE'VE ONLY CONNECTING. ONE THIRTY AUDITS THAT WERE DONE IN THE PRIOR THREE YEARS. ALSO FROM THE FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT WE WERE ALWAYS TRYING TO BALANCE- OUR WORK LIVES AND TRYING TO- RESPOND TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ISSUE SO IT'S IN PART TO KOPEN- ARE RESOURCES THAT ARE DEDICATED ARE SINGLE RESOURCE THAT'S DEDICATED TO C. E. ON ITS HAS LOTS OF OTHER FUNCTIONS AS WELL AND- HAS BEEN A RECENTLY- GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION TO CONTACT TRACING SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO- AS I SAID TRY TO AUTOMATE SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS SO THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO A MORE ROBUST- C. E. AUDIT BUT AT THIS POINT- WE HAVE STAFF WORKING IN VARIOUS AREAS. OKAY SO I'M GONNA TAKE THAT IS THE ANSWER IS YES THIS IS THE ON GOING AT LEAST CERTAINLY DURING TOTAL BID BUT- I DON'T KNOW TASK OF IT WE WILL BE HOPING FOR THE TASK OF A TIME- THAT I HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES- AND WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT REPRESENTS THAT- WE NEED TO DETERMINE. YOU KNOW WITH FOR AN EFFECTIVE C. E. PROGRAM WHAT'S REQUIRED- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE. OF THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU KNOW THERE ARE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT- ACTUALLY CREDIT THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROVIDERS. I JUST. THE QUESTION ABOUT. I DO THEY HAVE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS- POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT PROCEED- THAT'S BEEN RECEIVED BY PHARMACIST. IS IT DID THERE ARE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND RELATED TO THE MATERIAL THAT- THEY'RE BEING PROVIDED TO THEIR C. E. I WOULD NEED TO CONFIRM WITH THE- PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS THAT I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE STANDARD YES OKAY. AGAIN THIS IS A QUESTION I HAVE ASKED- USUALLY IF ALMOST EVERY HEALTH PROFESSIONS BOARD BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. OUR PROFESSIONALS ON THE RECEIVING CREDIT CLINT- CONCERNING EDUCATION THAT ACTUAR REQUIRING OF THEM THAT IT'S NOT AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT. IS ESSENTIALLY A SALES JOB BY SOMEONE IN INDUSTRY OR SOMETHING THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY CONTINUING EDUCATION SO. I'M SURE THESE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONS I SHOULD MAKE HOPE SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THE BOARD SAID. BE SURE THAT THE CASE- SO I DID SO I JUST APPRECIATE YOU CAN LAUGH. CHECK UP ON THAT AND- IF THEY'RE CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEN THAT'S PERHAPS SOMETHING THE BOARD SHOULD ADDRESS- THE OTHER THING THAT- ALSO WANT TO. ASK ABOUT IT I NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER- IT WAS REFERENCE MADE TO WORK FOR STUDY- WHERE DOES ACTUALLY EVEN- CONCERNED IT MAY BE AN OVERSUPPLY OF PHARMACISTS ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT GIVEN THE NEED OUT THERE. I HAD AN CHANCE LOOK THE STUDY ITSELF BUT- IT. I KNOW WE'VE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS IN TERMS OF SERVICE SUPERVISING PHARMACY TAX. IS THE BOARD-% EVERY CONSIDER DOING SOME SORT OF WORK FORCE EVALUATION TO BE SURE OUR OUR WORKLOAD EVALUATION IN TERMS OF- BE SURE THAT PHARMACISTS WHO ARE OUT IN THE FIELD THAT- THAT THEY'RE NOT- THAT BASICALLY THEY HAVE THE- TIME TO. CONDUCT A WORK I KNOW YOU CERTAINLY GET- TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF COMPLAINTS OR PROBLEMS THAT COME UP. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE BOARD LOOKS AT TO BE SURE THAT- READ OF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ISN'T BECAUSE OF EITHER EXCESSIVE WORKLOAD OR- EXCESSIVE SUPERVISION RESPONSIBILITIES THAT LEAD TO POTENTIAL EITHER ERRORS OR- ARE HARMED ITS CARS SO IS THAT SOMETHING THE BOARD LOOKED AT. THE BOARD ITSELF HAS NOT CONDUCTED ANY OF THOSE- TYPES OF STUDIES THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE- BUT NOT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA BUT I AM AWARE. OF SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO ALSO SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE REGARDING MEDICATION ERRORS. AND THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW- THAT THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND ISSUES BUT- I BELIEVE THAT THAT MAY BE ONE AREA THAT ALSO BLEEDS OVER INTO MEDICATION ERRORS AND- I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE BOARD WILL CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE- CONDUCTING A STUDY. OR WORKING WITH PERHAPS SOME OF THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO CONDUCT THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES OKAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE. IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW THE BOARD GAME PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE PROTECTOR OF THE CONSUMER- IT NEEDS TO BE SURE THAT THE WORK ENVIRONMENT WHICH PHARMACISTS ARE WORKING ALLOWS THEM TO DO THEIR JOB APPROPRIATELY AND HAD DIFFERENT DATA FIND PROBLEMS L. DOING THAT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. AND BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE WORKLOAD ISSUES THAT ARE LEADING TO ISSUE PROBLEMS WE ARE ASKING MORE OF OUR PHARMACISTS- AND- THERE ON THE FRONT LINES AND THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE VALUED MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM WHO DO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM. GIVE COVETED IMMUNIZATIONS HOPEFULLY AS A WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR THAT AS WELL AS OTHER. TYPES OF VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES AND- ALSO. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A DESIRE TO HAVE THEM DO MORE POTENTIALLY SCREENINGS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. AND BUT THOSE ALSO COME WITH GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES AND GREATER TIME AND SO WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT. AS WE'RE ROLLING THESE OUT THE BOARD IN THIS ROLE IS TO PUT NO CONSUMER PROTECTION- THAT IF IT. TO IDENTIFY ITS- THE WORKING FOR. OF WITH THE REST OF. WE GIVE FARM. IN A WAY THAT- THEY CAN PERFORM THEIR- JOBS- SAFELY AND CERTAINLY IS PROFESSIONALS I KNOW PHARMACISTS WILL SPEAK OUT OF THE SEA THERE'S PROBLEMS BUT- ALSO. I THINK THE BOARD HAS A ROLE AND- AND INTERACTING UP THOSE PHARMACISTS TO ENSURE THAT- AFTER THE WORK CONDITIONS ALLOW THEM TO. TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THE WAY THAT THEY THEY WERE THAT THEY DESIRE AS PROFESSIONALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND- APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND NOT. CERTAIN THAT THE- THE BOARD WILL PROVIDE INPUT- ON THIS CONFLICT OF INTEREST QUESTION THAT- THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER TODAY SO ASK YOUR STAFF TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KING. THE CARICATURE JUST A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS I DID NOTICE- ON IN JUST ON THE PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE REPORT. I GUESS OF REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS CLOSED- FOR ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TO ABOUT TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A CORRELATION BUT ALSO A- REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF- CONVICTIONS OR- YOU KNOW CITATIONS THAT WERE INVOLVED FROM MEMBERS SO COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH BY THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS. EXCELLENT HARD IT IS A FUNCTION OF THAT COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED- IT'S ALSO IN PART THE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE DOING THAT SOMETIMES ARE VERY COMPLEX ELKS IN IF YOU LOOK AT OUR INVESTIGATION CASE TIMES THEY'RE ALSO A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN WE WOULD- LIKE. AND IN PART IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TYPES OF CASES. THE BOARD HAS WORKED REALLY HARD TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION- IN ADDITION TO ENFORCEMENT AND- HOW PART OF IT COULD BE THE RESULT OF THE BOARD'S EDUCATION EFFORTS WE PROVIDE- C. E. AND A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AREAS. INCLUDING PHARMACY LAW AND ETHICS WE ALSO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT TRAINING WITH- PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION CORRESPONDING RESPONSIBILITY. PREVENTING FACTS AND LOSSES AND THOSE ARE ALL CORD PROVIDED TRAINEES WE ALSO ARE TRYING TO DO A LOT MORE IN TERMS OF EDUCATION USING OUR SUBSCRIBER ALERT SYSTEM AND OUR NEWSLETTER. SO I THINK IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT ITEMS. THE TICKET A QUICK FOLLOW UP- SO YOU SAID YOU NOTED THAT THERE ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND INVEST. BUT TWO THOUSAND DESTINATIONS OVER THE- THREE YEAR PERIOD. WAS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR. I WOULD HAVE TO PULL THE DATA WERE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING OUR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE OUR- SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE. THAT WILL BE SUBMITTED ON DECEMBER FIRST AFFECTS AGREEABLE YES THAT THAT IS THANK YOU- I JUST JUST WANNA JUST HIGHLIGHT WHY I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS I MEAN FOR. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AS WE GO THROUGH THIS SUNSET HEARINGS IN WE HEAR. ALL THE VERY US DIFFERENT- BOARDS WE COSTLY HERE FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR FRIDAY OF ISSUES AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE- DIFFERENT BOARDS ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE THAT THEY CAN ON THE MATTER FOR MET. THE CHALLENGE TO- WE WILL BE HERE YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES COME IN DURING THESE. TIMES AT TIMES DURING HEARINGS BUT ALSO DURING COMMITTEE TIMES. DURING VARIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS ABOUT JUST THE VARIETY OF WAYS THAT- YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEIR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PROPERLY DO THE. ENFORCEMENT THAT WERE ASKED TO DO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG. I WOULD INVITE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY LEFT QUESTIONS TO PLEASE THAT USED TO RAISE YOUR HAND FUNCTION SO YOU CAN BE RECOGNIZE OTHERWISE I WILL. HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE CHAMBERS BUT JUST WANNA. I'LL BEGIN MY QUESTIONS. AND IF- THERE IS A MEMBER WHO HAS A QUESTION A LOT WILL CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE YOU IN AN AND FOLLOWING MY QUESTIONS AND THERE'S WILL GO TO THE PUBLIC FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL. RIGHT- AT MINNESOTA GRIN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE STAFF AND ALICE'S I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FIRST ONE- THERE WAS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR DEALING WITH THE FARM TECH RATIO ISSUE- AND THE BOARD AT THAT TIME HAD DID NOT WEIGH IN WITH A THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT RATIO OF ONE TO ONE IS APPROPRIATE AND WHETHER UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. SHOULD BE EXPANDED DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THAT OR IS THERE STUDIES BEING DONE BY THE BOARD IN THIS IN THIS ISSUE. I SO THE BOARD DOES NOT. EXCUSE ME DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION- I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A WIN- TO. HE BACK IN ON SOME OF WHAT AND DOCTOR PANTS FACT ABOUT AS PHARMACIST ARE GIVEN ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW AUTHORITIES THERE'S A BALANCING ACT THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR TO ENSURE THAT- HAITIANS ARE STILL RECEIVING ALL OF THE NECESSARY CARE. AND WORKLOAD IS IF HE SAID THAT AS A MEDICATION THERE'S A LOTS OF OTHER THINGS SO I THINK THAT ITSELF IT'S A HOLISTIC COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED- THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW DISCUSSIONS IN THE MEDIA ABOUT MEDICATION ERRORS. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL WITH THE RATIONS AND WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE- IT NEEDS TO BE BELIEVE THE BOARD WILL BE. LOOKING AT THE ISSUE IN A VERY DELIBERATE IN FASHION TO SEE IF AN INCREASE IN THE RATIO WOULD ACTUALLY- AT ADDRESS WHAT COULD BE. BE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES FOR FURTHER- JUST WORK THE PHARMACY TO BE DO. BY INCREASE THE LAW OF- THE NUMBER OF THAT ARE ALSO REQUIRED SUPERVISION. WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION- BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY TO BRING THAT ISSUE TO A HEAD AND PROVIDE EXPERTISE TO US. ON MATTERS SUCH AS THIS A WEEKEND THAT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO MAKE CHANGES SO I WOULD JUST TO LIGHT A FIRE. UNDER YOUR WORK THERE- WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS AND VALUES AND ENSURING- PATIENT CARE IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. AT THE SAME TIME- WE WANT OUR PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR BEST WORK. AND SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T MEAN HAVING THE- CHIEF PHARMACISTS DO EVERYTHING- IN TERMS OF COUNTING PILLS THAT CAN BE DONE BY. A PERSON WHO'S BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED BUT HAVE- THE ABILITY TO TAKE OVER THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES TO FREE UP THAT PHARMACISTS FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL- ISSUE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR- CONTINUED REVIEW OF THAT LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR FEEDBACK. I'D LIKE TO TURN TO- PAGE THIRTY FOR THE ANALYSIS WORD ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF- THE ISSUES- REGARDING KOBE NINETEEN AND- YOU DID SPEAK IN YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT SOME OF THAT. A TEMPORARY LICENSES AND- THAT MATTERS THAT YOU HAVE ENGAGED IN- IN REGARD TO IT IN CALIFORNIA. MY QUESTION IS- LUCKILY THROUGH THE GOOD STEWARDSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND HIS TEAM. WE HAVE NOT BEEN OVER RUN WITH KOBE CASES WE ARE AT IT IS SERIOUS AB. THE POINT OF CONCERN IN REGARD TO INFECTIONS GOING UP. DRAMATICALLY NOW. AS THEY DID IN THE SUMMER- BUT WE HAVEN'T ARE OUR OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS HAVE NOT BEEN OVER RUN AS THEY HAD BEEN IN OTHER STATES. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE DELIVERY OF PHARMACY SERVICES AND SOME OF THESE STATES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT. EXTREME IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCES SO THAT. IF THINGS WERE TO GET WORSE HERE THAT. WE WOULD BE PREPARED AS WE COULD BE FROM- THE- OUR HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDING OUR PHARMACIES. THAT YOU'RE ON MUTE. EIGHTY I WAS UNABLE TO MEET STILL AS PART OF OUR COMPANY WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND PARTICIPATING IN NATIONAL MEETINGS AS WELL WITH THE OTHER STATE BOARDS OF PHARMACY- I'M THE LEADING END OF MANY OF THE RESPONSES AND- I BELIEVE THAT IN MANY CASES THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING HAS BEEN LEVERAGED BY OTHER ENTITIES AS WELL. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY- IT SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE DELIVERY OF PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES IN IN YORK IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE HAVE HAD SERIOUS- RUN OF COVE IN NINETEEN- HOSPITALIZATIONS AND THE LIKE. STILL CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE THE CHALLENGES WITH THAT PP- SO WE DO HAVE WAIVERS IN EFFECT THERE IN MANY STATES ACROSS THE NATION HALF THOSE- EARLY ON WHEN THERE IS- A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH DIRECT SHORTAGES IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE OUTSOURCING FACILITIES- THAT ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA AND WE DEVELOPED A LIST OF PRODUCTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO MAKE IT- SO THAT HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY THAT WE'RE NEEDING- MEDICATIONS TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCING ACT- BUT WE WERE VERY PROACTIVE IN DOING THAT AND ENSURING THAT THERE WAS RESOURCES AVAILABLE- SO THAT HOSPITALS ESPECIALLY WOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE TO GO WITH RESPECT TO DISTRACTIONS IN- AT PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT- HYDROCHLORIC NGUYEN AND ATTENTIONAL SHORTAGES THERE. ON THE BOARD WORKED WITH BOTH THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WE RE LEASED- A STATEMENT REMINDING BOTH PRESCRIBERS AND DISPENSERS ABOUT THE STANDARD OF CARE IN TO BE FOLLOWING THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF CARE. AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT TOOK ACTIONS TO ACTUALLY- RESTRICT- MEDICATION DISPENSING IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT IS NOT BE APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN IN CALIFORNIA. DID YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE OUR PHARMACIES ARE CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH- AN ESCALATION OF. COVERT NINETEEN VIRUSES AND ALL THEIR AFFECTS THAT- THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR INDUSTRY OF CONFIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED NOW. I BELIEVE SO I THINK THAT- PHARMACIST HAD JUST DEMONSTRATED TREMENDOUS RESILIENCY- THROUGH THIS ENTIRE AND PANDEMICS AND I THINK THAT- WE HAVE VERY GOOD DIALOGUE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND IF THERE ARE NEEDS FOR- ADDITIONAL WAIVERS- THE BOARD IS DISCUSSING THESE ROUTINELY DURING BOARD MEETINGS WE ALSO HAVE OUR WAIVER PROCESS ONLINE SHOULD A NEED COME UP THAT HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN IDENTIFIED. BUT I BELIEVE THAT CLICK THE COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE MAINTAINED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PROCESSES THAT WE HAVE. HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE ABLE TO QUICKLY RESPONDS TO THE VERY DYNAMIC NATURE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT WE REGULATE. ARE READY AND WILLING AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE HEALTH CRISIS THANK YOU THAT'S COMFORTING TO HEAR IS THERE ENOUGH PP NOW FOR ALL THE PHARMACIES- FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ENOUGH PP. ARBACE ON MY UNDER. THERE AT THE SUPPLIES BETTER- I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES WITH SOME- OF THE P. P. EACH ON SPECIFIC TO THOSE THAT HAVE SIZING REQUIREMENTS MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY HAVING THE RIGHT TYPES OF SIZING- LIKE I SAID WE DO STILL HAVE OUR WAIVERS IN PLACE FOUR PP SO THAT. IF THE CONDITIONS REQUIRE PEOPLE HAVE THE GOOD- GUARDRAILS ON WHAT TO DO AND IN RESPONSE I CANNOT SPEAK TO OUTSIDE OF COURSE THE PHARMACY RE NAME ONLY SPEAKING SPECIFIC TO YOU- PHARMACISTS. IT USED YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS CHAIN IS ADEQUATE SO THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY PROTECTED WITH PP. STILL I CAN SPEAK TO THE PHARMACIST AND THE ACTIONS THAT THE BOARD HAS TAKEN ON IN ADDITION TO THE WAIVERS FOR THE RE USE THAT P. P. E. THAT WERE YOU KNOW MODELED AFTER- EXPERIENCE- IN THE FIELD WE ALSO WORKED TO ISSUE TEMPORARY LICENCES TO FACILITATE- DISTRIBUTION OF P. P. E. AS WELL AS BETTER LEADERS INTO THE STATE. BY EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF DISTRIBUTORS THAT COULD PROVIDE THOSE PRODUCTS INTO AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA. BUT I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT I AND I'M SURE PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF COMFORT TO LISTENERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE WATCHING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD AND IN OUR STATE. ON IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE THE BOARD AT BE PROACTIVE IN THESE PLACES- TO. ADD TO THE CONFIDENCE SCALE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT WE ARE PREPARED AS WE CAN BE. I'D LIKE TO MOVE NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN- THE DRESSING PAGE TWENTY FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT ADVANCE PHARMACY TECHNICIANS- THE BOARD'S INDICATED THAT THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING- THE LICENSE TYPE PREVENTS PHARMACY TECHNICIANS- AND THE QUESTION THAT STAFF HAS RAISED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT- THAT. THAT CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT WHAT PLACE ARE WE WITH IN THAT. SUBJECT AREA COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT IN TERMS OF HOW FAR ALONG YOU ARE IN. ENGAGING AND WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT PLEASE. ABSOLUTELY SO THE BOARD'S LICENSING COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE BOARD ITSELF HAS CONVENED AT NUMEROUS MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL. ON THE BOARD- WAS IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING IT AND RECEIVED- SOME. ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER COMMENT EXPRESSING CONCERNS AN ASSET TO THE BOARD DECIDED TO- SCHEDULE AN ADDITIONAL MEETING TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION. REGRETTABLY THAT MEETING WAS CANCELED IT WAS ACTING VERY BEGINNING- IT WAS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SINCE THEN THE BOARD HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON THE ADVANCED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL- IS- IN SOME RESPECTS LINK TO YOUR PRIOR QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO RATIOS- THE APPROACH OF THE ADVANCED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN WOULD BE PROVIDING AND THE MID LEVEL PRACTITIONER THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE LIGHTENING THE LOAD. FOR PHARMACIST IN PERHAPS A DIFFERENT FASHION- THE RATIO IN ITSELF CHANGE. WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT WORK AND WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE IT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT- FEEDBACK TO US- ON THIS- IN THAT AREA. I'D LIKE TO MOVED OUT TO ISSUE NUMBER. ELEVEN ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN THIS IS TO MATTER REGARDING THE EXAMINATION- AND THE RECENT CHEATING SCANDAL THAT OCCURRED- IN REGARD TO THE EXAMINATION. AND I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS- OBVIOUSLY EVERY STUDENT WAS INVOLVED IN THAT THERE WERE SOME- INNOCENT. PARTIES INVOLVED THAT WERE CAUGHT UP IN IT DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT FOR THE STUDENTS AND WHAT PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE EXAM IS- IS DONE. FAIRLY AND CORRECTLY AND THAT THAT'S KIND OF DISRUPTION. IN THE LIVES OF THESE- SOON TO BE. PHARMACISTS IS MINIMIZED. HERE I MEET AGAIN. YEAH I SORRY SOMETIMES I'M UNABLE TO MEET- YOU'D SAID THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH THAT- WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE CTG IS- A TRAGEDY- IT WAS. EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE EVENT BY THE BOARD DID NOT HAVE ANY OPTIONS- PART OF THE BASIC PREMISES SEVEN EXAM IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR THE BOARD USES THE CPJ HE ASKED ONE OF THE- PRIMARY TEST FOR ASSESSING MINIMUM COMPETENCY. BEFORE ALLOWING SOMEONE TO ENTER THE MARKET PLACE AND GIVEN THE WIDESPREAD COMPROMISE. OF THE EXAM THE EXAM WAS NO LONGER VALID THE BOARD DIDN'T HAVE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GOOD OPTIONS. WHAT IT DID DO IS MOVE VERY QUICKLY TO RE ADMINISTERING THE EXAM. THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF I WILL TELL YOU IS ON GOING- I CANNOT GO INTO A LOT OF SPECIFICS BECAUSE IT IS ONGOING BUT- THE BOARD HAS DISCIPLINED- SOME LICENSES. THE BOARD ALSO BELIEVES THAT HE HAS A GOOD CONTROLS IN PLACE. TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE TO PREVENT THE WIDESPREAD SUBVERSION WHAT IS HAPPENING. ON AS WAS REVEALED THROUGH OUR IN. ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS ISSUE ITSELF THE BOARD IS ALSO WORKING THE OFFICE OF FOR EXAM. SERVICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF- THE PHARMACIST EXAMS AND IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE pTHE BOARD WILL ABSOLUTELY CONSIDER AS- VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR THAT- EXPLANATION AND- ATTENTION TO THAT TO THAT MATTER. I'D LIKE TO MOVE NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN ON PAGE THIRTY- THIS IS THE ISSUE OF- THE DYNAMAX DECISION AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE PHARMACY PROFESSION- AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE PHARMACISTS WERE NOT GIVEN AN EXEMPTION- IN THE- FOLLOW UP LEGISLATION AB FIVE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE. COME IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. HAS THERE BEEN ANY- FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE BOARD ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THE CURRENT- LANDSCAPE OF THE PROFESSION WOULD REQUIRE AN EXEMPTION OR NOT- THE BOARD HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE OR OR TO SCHEDULE ANY PUBLIC DISCUSSION- BUT AFTER THE BOARD REVIEWS THE ISSUE PAPERS ON WE WILL IT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSE DETAIL OUT WHAT THAT- WHAT THE PLAN IS IN TERMS OF. RESPONDING TO THIS ISSUE. OKAY I'M GONNA INVITE MR LIBBY BACK IN A MOMENT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE MATTERS THAT SEEM TO BE PENDING THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF THOSE. I WANT TO- MOVE NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE- THIS IS THE- MATTER OF UNUSED CANCER MEDICATION TRANSFERS- WE'VE SEEN THAT LEGISLATION IN THE LAST YEAR FROM SOME OF OUR GOOD COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. WHO RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE OF CANCER MEDICATION AND THE POTENTIAL- WASTE OF CANCER MEDICATION THAT IS OCCURRING. AND THIS- ITEM ADDRESSES THAT THAT CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME STATUTORY CHANGES. THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE TYPE OF VOLUNTARY DRUG REPOSITORY DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE USE FOR OTHER MEDICATIONS COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. I'M SORRY SO- IS SPECIFIC TO THE DAY- CANCER MEDICATION- THERE IS A PROGRAM WITHIN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR THE REDISTRIBUTION OF MEDICATIONS THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON AND I CANCER MEDICATIONS THE DRUGS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE- BY AND LARGE ARE- DEVELOPED BY THE COUNTY PROGRAM WHICH ON. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY COUNTY THAT IS CURRENTLY INCLUDING CANCER BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ANY PROHIBITIONS IN THE LAW THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. VERY GOOD WILL WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED EXAMINATION OF THAT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE ANY LIMITATIONS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW. FOR THE VOLUNTARY- DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH LIFESAVING MEDICATION I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MY QUESTIONS BY INVITING MR LIPPY TO COME BACK. TO THE SCREEN MISTER THAT BE THAT PER SHAPE-THE AGAIN THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU AND THE BOARD DO YOU ARE INVOLUNTARY POSITIONS BUT YOU AREIN POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP. AND A PART OF THAT IS THAT NEED IN THE REQUIREMENT TO ENGAGE IN AND MANY OF THESE SERIOUS ISSUES SOME OF WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY- I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN- ENSURING THAT THE BOARD HAS THE TIME TO DELIBERATE AND ENGAGE. WE WANTYOUR EXPERTISE TO COME IN WITH GREAT- DIVERSITY AND EXPERTISE IN THESE IN THESE MATTERS WE WANT TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THE BOARD TO BE ENGAGED. AND NOT TO BE AFRAID TO TAKE ON CHALLENGING ISSUES DIFFICULT ISSUES WITH THERE'S CONFLICTS. BECAUSE WE WANT YOUR EXPERTISE IN THE GAME WE WANT YOUR INPUT AND I WOULD SUGGEST THANK YOU AGAIN AND GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSE HERE AT LEAST IN THIS SEGMENT BEFORE WE GO TO. PUBLIC TESTIMONY. ABOUT AT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO GET THE BOARDING GAUGED. ON THESE MATTERS SOME OF WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. OKAY WHAT WE'RE DOING MOSTLY- IS. CONTINUING TO HAVE MANY MANY MEETINGS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT ISSUES- LATELY IT HASN'T AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS. MOST OF OUR TIME IS BEING SPENT MOST OF MY TIME HAS BEEN SPENT IN ISSUING APPROVING WAIVERS. RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES AND NECESSARY ESPECIALLY ON THE ENFORCEMENT AREA- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN MENTIONED HERE IN THE PAST BUT- WE DEAL WITH APPROXIMATELY- FIFTY OR SIXTY CASES A MONTH. ON THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS SO IT'S A VERY ACTIVE BOARD- WE DON'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY. AND- WE EXPECT THAT TO GO THROUGH ALL OF YOUR ISSUES AND MAKE SURE THAT THE BOARD TAKES LEADERSHIP. IN THE RESPONSE TO A- THANK YOU MR LIBBY WE LOOK WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE IS- VIGOROUS ENERGY AND ENGAGEMENT GOT GOING FORWARD. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA ASK MEMBERS ONE LAST TIME IF THERE'S FURTHER QUESTIONS I SEE SENATOR AN HERE IN THE CHAMBER AND THEN I'LL GO TO THE PHONE LINES. AND SEE IF THERE'S MEMBERS OUT IN THE- WORLD OUT THERE THAT ALSO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS TO ASK BUT SENATOR CAN'T PLEASE THANK YOU JUST A ONE BRIEF QUESTION ABOUT ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH IS FISCAL ISSUES REGARDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BILLING RATE- AND I KNOW THERE'S A BROADER ISSUE JUST THE BOARD OF PHARMACY- BUT- IN REGARDS TO THE BOARD ITSELF- AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THIS IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE PASS. BUDGETS- FOR THE STATE. WHAT HOW MUCH DONE NOTIFICATION OR JUSTIFICATION. HEAD WAS PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TO THE- BOARD OF PHARMACY. FOR THE RATE INCREASES THAT THEY CHARGE BECAUSE IT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASE. FOR LEGAL SERVICES. SO I'LL SPEAK IN GENERAL TERMS BUT- WITH YOUR- APPROVAL WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT MORE FULLY WHEN THE BOARD SUBMITS ITS RESPONSES TO THESE ISSUES IN GENERAL- SOME OF THE NOTIFICATION WAS- THAT THROUGH THAT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS- AND SOME DIRECTLY- I WOULD SAY THAT IT IT WAS HARD TO- MANAGE AND NAVIGATE THE INCREASE WE BELIEVE THAT. WERE OKAY FOR NOW- BUT WITH DAY THE STATE NOT BE SEEN- THE BUDGET CRISIS THAT IT IS FOR GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR BUDGET INITS ENTIRETY- NOT JUST THE EIGHTEEN LINE ITEM BUT THOSE KINDS OF UNEXPECTED- EXPENSES- DO YOU CREATE- SOME CHALLENGES OPERATIONALLY AND BUT WE WORK HARD TO TRY TO- NAVIGATE AND MITIGATE. RIGHT THANK YOU- IT YES CERTAINLY DIED ANY SORT OF FEEDBACK WE CAN GET FROM BOARDS- AS WE DO OUR OWN BUDGET DELIBERATIONS AND- I OUR OWN CONVERSATIONS WITH DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL. THERE'S A SOMEONE WHO HOLDS A LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PHARMACY BUT ANOTHER BOARD- YOU KNOW THIS TRICKLES DOWN SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU GET HIT WITH THIS P. AND THEN THE YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR FEES WHICH THEN HITS. THOSE OF US ON THE FRONT LINES TRYING TO TAKE YOUR PATIENCE SOME OF US- WE THERE'S AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW PHYSICIAN FOR PHARMACIES BEEN STRESSES AND STRAINS AS WELL FINANCIALLY FOR MANY PHARMACIES PHARMACISTS- AND WE NEED TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE VERY RAPID INCREASES OR CHANGES AND FEES. AS A RESULT AND AT LEAST OUR NEEDS WE NEED TO SEEK OUT SOME JUSTIFICATION AS TO WHY THE SUDDEN CHANGES THAT AND HAVE THESE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS THAT BEGAN AFFECTING THOSE OPTING TO OPERATIONS A BUDGET THE BOARD AND THEN OF COURSE THE LICENSEES WHO. MAY HAVE TO DENDERA SEE INCREASED HELP SUPPORT THE VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF. THE BOARD SO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FOR TO THAT MORE THE- THAT PRESS- ANSWER- WHEN YOU- THE BOY RESPOND.

AND SO IN THEORY THE BOARD HAS HAD UP TO EIGHT MONTHS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED IN ADVANCE AND THUS FAR IT'S BEEN MY OBSERVATION THAT THE- BOARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT EVASIVE AND NOT ANSWERING DIRECTLY THESE QUESTIONS AND I HAVE SOME CONCERNS I JUST WANT TO. SHARE THOSE OBSERVATIONS THAT MOVING FORWARD I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS I HEARD A LOT OF EVASION WITH RESPECT TO THE BOARD NOT TAKING A POSITION QUITE YET- BUT CERTAINLY GIVEN THE LONG LENGTH OF TIME TO WHICH THE BOARD HAS HAD. SOME OF THESE ISSUES. TO BE ADDRESSED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE EXERCISE OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY AND HOLD THE BOARD TO ACCOUNT SO AGAIN.

THE DIRECT ANSWERS IN ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC OUTLINING ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS WORKS FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. WELL SAID. LOW THAT TIME LINE I THINK IS ACCURATE. THERE'S A SENSITIVITY TO FROM THE ADMINISTRATION INTO THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESSES AND IN THE PAST THERE'S BEEN SOME.

YOUR REPORT TO THIS HEARING WE ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR NANCY. MR AZLAN DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD O THAT THE TESTIMONY BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. BUT NO I THINK I'M GOOD AT THE DOCTOR MEANS HE COVERED EVERYTHING I WAS GOING TO COVER- ON HERE AND WE CAN JUST GO RIGHT TO YOUR- QUESTION CAN ISSUES SCHOOL. VERY GOOD I'D LIKE TO INVITE- COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBERS AND ON OUR PHONE LINES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS TO PLEASE SO INDICATE SO WE COULD US. CALLING YOU I SEE SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU- SERRA GLACIER A TRANSLATOR AND AGAIN CREATE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE- FOR THE ACTOR THE MEDICAL BOARD- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- ACTUALLY QUESTIONS I ASK OF- PARTICULARLY THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS BOARD- RELATE TO CONTINUING EDUCATION I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT. ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT- THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU- BASICALLY AUDIT ABOUT 5% OF YOUR LICENSEES UNDER ELECTION UNDER RENEWAL CYCLES. AND CERTAINLY SHOWING THAT YOU HAVE A- LOW- FAILURE RATE ON THE- C. I. IT'S- SO PERHAPS YOU CAN COMMENT JUST BRIEFLY FIRST OF ALL ON THE YET THAT THIS. IS THERE ANY CHANGE IN THE AUDIT RATES- GOING FORWARD SO YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS BUT- LITTERED IN TERMS OF YOUR OWN STAFFING. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION RELATED TO CONTINUE EDUCATION IS THAT MAKE NOTE THAT THE BOARD ITSELF ACTUALLY APPROVES- THE CONSUMING EDUCATION PROVIDERS AN ORGANIZATION INSTITUTIONS. AND WHILE YOU MAKE NOTE THAT YOU DON'T ACTIVELY AUDIT TO SEE PROVIDERS THAT YOU DO HAVE A POLICY BUT TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU- ACTUALLY CONDUCT ANY REVIEW ARMED FORCE MEANT OF THE C. E. TO ENSURE THAT MEET STANDARDS AND THEN FINALLY- DO YOU HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST STANDARD TO ENSURE THAT THE C. E- PEOPLE THE LICENSEES ARE RECEIVING IS. ACTUALLY CONTINUING EDUCATION AND NOT MARKETING- FROM- INTERESTED- INDUSTRIES ARE ARE ARE PROVIDE OUR- THE COMPANY'S SIDE SO THAT THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY TEACHER THE C. IS SEPARATE FROM. A SEPARATE FROM- UNDUE COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE SO- THOSE ARE THREE QUESTIONS RELATE TO CONTINUE EDUCATION AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADDRESS THOSE. ZERO THREE- SO THE SCENE EACH YEAR WE- USUALLY DO OUR AUDITS- WANTED TIMES A YEAR. AND WE HAVE A VERY LOW RATE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT COMPLIANCE WE DO HAVE BEEN REGULATIONS WAIVER REQUIREMENT. THAT SPECIALLY DURING CODE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ONE PERSON SOME THAT WAIVER REQUEST HERE AND- WE DIDN'T NEED TO GET PAID- A WAIVER OUTSIDE. BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THE REGULATIONS ONE PERSON WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR. SEEN THESE BECAUSE THE- SOURCE THAT THERE WILL BE TO TAKE RISKS. ON IN YOUR SECOND QUESTION AGAIN WELL I GUESS AND OF THE FOR QUESTION IS LESS THAT BECAUSE HE DID PROVIDERS. IN TERMS OF RATE PERCENTAGE YOU PLAN TO AUDIT IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE IN THE UPCOMING YEARS OR IS THAT- USED IS THAT PATTERN STILL GOING TO STAY THE SAME LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE APPROXIMATE 5% OF YOUR LICENSEES. TO USE THAT SELLERS PROBABLY GONNA BE THE SAME OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE THE PATTERNS OF SAYING IT SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE ALL. THREE HALF YEARS IT LOOKS THE IN BACK IN HIS DATA ON THAT LOOKS LIKE IT THAT FOR STAY THIS OKAY AND THE SECOND THE SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT BECAUSE THE BOARD ITSELF ACTUALLY PROVES COMMUNICATION COURSE PROVIDERS AND WORK THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND MAKE NOTE THAT IN YOUR REPORT YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T ACTIVELY AUDIT THESE PROVIDERS WHAT TYPE OF A REVIEW OR ENFORCEMENT DO YOU DO OF THE CONTINUING EDUCATION TO BE CERTAIN STANDARDS AND THEN FINALLY YOU HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY TO ENSURE THERE'S AN UNDUE COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE OVER THE CONTINUED EDUCATION CONTENT. THAT PROVIDERS ARE. RECEIVING THROUGH CONTINUING EDUCATION. RIGHT SO SEEK IS BEING GOVERNING OVER THE SEA AND USE HERE ON THERE IS A ONE ON THE WEBSITE ONCE YOU CAN BE WEBSITE OF APPROVED SCHEME EQUAL. IN SO WE USE THAT GUIDANCE- TO- PRODUCT WHAT AVAILABLE SEE N. B. COURSE OR OR ON MORE TO THE. I ALSO LIKE TO ADD. IN IF I MAY PLEASE. YES SO THAT'S A GOOD POINT THE C. P. THERE IS WELL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET A LICENSE CALIFORNIA IT'S PROBABLY OF MORE MOST DIFFERENT STATE. IN THE KIND TO GET LICENSES A PODIATRIST. WITH THAT BEING SAID CPM WE YOU PAY DUES TO BOTH TO. ME YOU INCLUDED IN THAT IS. A SEMINAR THAT'S HOW I'D SAY IT BE OPPORTUNITY CREDIT IT'S STATE YOU KNOW- CENTER THAT'S HOW EVERY YEAR. YOU FULFILL ALL OF C. M. IF YOU ATTENDED IT IS VERY WELL IT. AND MOST PEOPLE TO ADVANTAGE OF THAT SO I DON'T I THINK WE. OFTEN. ABOUT HERE YOU KNOW IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES IS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND GOOD ACTORS CALIFORNIA HAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THIS FIFTY NINE THOUSAND AND DIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST THIRTY TWO THOUSAND PHARMACISTS SO WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT NUMBERS. YOU KNOW. OUR BOARD OVERSEEING- A GROUP OF PEOPLE IT'S MINUSCULE IT IS IN IN REGARDS TO YOU YOU KNOW. OTHER MEDICAL SPECIALTY THAT YOU CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT I'M JUST ASKING TO THAT SINCE THE BOARD ITSELF ACCORDING TO THE REPORT ACTUALLY- PRUE C. COURSES AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WORKING WITH YOU KNOW PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND SO FORTH THAT IS A WAY OF DOING IT. IS THAT JUST WHAT WAS WHAT DOES THE BOARD DO TO ASSURE THAT THAT THE QUALITY THIS OF THE CONTINUE EDUCATION RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE DOES IT DOES IT DOESN'T AVE TO. DOES THE US THE CITY ANY SHARE WITH YOU THE STANDARDS THAT THEY USED TO FOR THEIR OWN COURSES YOU GO YUP I LOOKED AT HIM TO LOOK GOOD YOU KNOW GO FORTH AND THAT'S WHAT WE APPROVED AND THAT'S FINE TOO BUT I YEAH DAY. SO THERE IS A MECHANISM THEY HAVE. TO TELL US WHO THE SPEECHES ARE. HELLO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE IF IS A SPONSOR SPONSOR IT LIKE IT'S- TRY TO. SELL THE LATEST ANKLE OR AYE AFTER THE VICE. YOU KNOW GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE WHO'S- YOU KNOW PANDERING. YOU KNOW A BUSINESS SERVICES SO YOU'RE TELLING IS THE BOARD LOOKS AT THIS SO THAT'S OKAY SO THAT THAT THAT DAY THAT THAT THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER- AND I DO THINK THAT- IT. WELL CERTAINLY BELIEVE YOU REVIEW IT ON INDIVIDUAL BASIS I DO ENCOURAGE THE BOARD TO HAVE A MORE FORMALIZED POLICY ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST RELATED TO SEE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST GOOD AS A STANDARD I THINK YOU PROBABLY. INHERENTLY DO THAT IN YOUR VIEW THE COURSES BUT THAT'S SOMETHING I BROUGHT UP AND I BEGIN TO REALISE SKILLS DIFFERENT- BUT IT'S IT IS ABOUT IT IS A STATEMENT. ABOUT VALUES AND- ALSO CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT BECAUSE THAT IS A REQUIREMENT FOR LICENSURE TO HAVE C. E. SO YOU'D WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE C. E. IS OF APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF LIKE YOU ARE REVIEWING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE REVIEWING THE SPEAKERS AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S THAT'S APPRECIATE THAT. AND I JUST DO ALSO ENCOURAGE BOARDS TO HAVE IF THEY THEMSELVES ARE ACTUALLY. APPROVING THE C. E.

WITH ME TODAY IS THE BOARD'S ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER STEVE SODERBERGH BUT IN LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATION MANAGER ROSE ENHANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. MANAGER MILO MCMANUS. WE WANT TO THANK COMMITTEES FOR THEIR WORK AND ASSISTANCE DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE ORDER OF THE BOARD SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET TO REVIEW. THE MORE REGULATE. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS LICENSE MANAGE LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS. LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELORS AND LICENSED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGISTS. PROTECTING CONSUMERS RESPONDING TO EMERGING TRENDS IN MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE AND THE NEEDS OF THE PROFESSIONS WE REGULATE GUIDANCE US AS WE SEEK A LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES TO REVISE OUR EXISTING LAW AND REGULATIONS. I AM PLEASED TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW EXAMPLES OF OUR WORK WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. THE FIRST ONE IS EXAMINATION RESTRUCTURE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN THE BOARD REVISED THE SEQUENCE OF THE LICENSURE EXAMINATION PROGRESS. THE NEW EXAMINATION'S SEQUENCE NOW REQUIRES ALL ASSOCIATES TO TAKE THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND ETHICS EXAMINATION WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF REGISTRATION. PREVIOUSLY ALL EXAMINATION CANDIDATES WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE THE LICENSURE EXAMS AFTER COMPLETION OF THEY WERE SUPERVISED WORK EXPERIENCE HOURS. THE NEW SEQUENCE DEMONSTRATES TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S AN ASSOCIATE WHO PASSED THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND ETHICS EXAMINATION IS KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE LAWFUL AND ETHICAL PRACTICES THAT GOVERN THEIR PROFESSION. THE CLINICAL EXAM IS THEN ADMINISTERED. TO THE COMPLETION OF SUPERVISED EXPERIENCE HOURS ASSESSING CANDIDATES CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCY. ADDITIONALLY THE EXAMINATION RESTRUCTURE PROVIDES THE BOARD THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE TO NATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATIONS LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. NATIONAL CLINICAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING EXAMINATION- IT'S FOR THE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELORS AND OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL REPORTS NATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION IS FOR THE LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS. THE USE OF THE NATIONAL EXAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDES A STREAMLINED PATHWAY TO LICENSURE IN OTHER STATEFOR CALIFORNIA LICENSEES. THE SECOND EXAMPLE IS THE SUPERVISOR SUPERVISION WORK EXPERIENCE AND SUPERVISOR REQUIREMENTS. THE BOARD SUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN SUPERVISED WORK EXPERIENCE BY ELIMINATING THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OR BUCKETS TO COMPLETE SO QUALIFIED FOR LICENSURE. CANDIDATES NOW HAVE ONLY TWO CATEGORIES CLINICAL SERVICES AND NON CLINICAL SERVICES TO COMPLETE THE BOARD ALSO STRENGTHENED THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOME A SUPERVISOR AND BERMAN DEFINES IT RESPONSIBILITIES OF A SUPERVISOR TO IMPROVE. THE QUALITY OF SUPERVISION. THE NEXT EXAM IS ANGUISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE RECOGNIZING THE DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA THE BOY WAS SUCCESSFUL IN THIS PROPOSAL TO ALLOW EXAMINATION CANDIDATES FOR WHOM ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE ADDITIONAL TIME TO TAKE A LICENSURE EXAMINATIONS. THE REGULATIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER FIRST. TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS THE LICENSE PORTABILITY. ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNS THAT THE BOARD'S LICENSE PORTABILITY BILL WHICH IS THE SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY NINE NINE EIGHT. THIS BILL REMOVES BARRIERS TO LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA FOR OUT OF STATE LICENSED APPLICANTS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST WITH TWENTY TWENTY LICENSED MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS AND LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELORS WHO ARE LICENSED IN ANOTHER STATE OR AT LEAST TWO YEARS MAY APPLY FOR LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE NEW STREAMLINED PROCESS. THIS WILL HELP INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL CALIFORNIA'S A SENSE TO IMPROVE LICENSE PORTABILITY IS SERVING AS A MODEL FOR CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THE NEXT ONE IS THE CULPRIT NINETEEN RESPONSE WILL CALL THE NINETEEN WAS NOT ADDRESSED THE BOARD TO ORIGINAL SUNSET TO RECORDING TWENTY NINETEEN. THE THE SPEND DOWN MAKE SHOULD BE NOTED. WITH A MINIMAL IMPACTS THE SERVICES THE BOY WAS ABLE TO TRANSITION MOST OF THE STAFF TO REMOTE WORK SETTING. THIS REQUIRED NOT ONLY EQUIPPING STAFF WITH THE NECESSARY HARDWARE BUT ALSO TRAINING STAFF ON NEW PROCEDURES FOR SCANNING AND RETRIEVING APPLICATION DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY. THE WATER WAS ALSO ABLE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND TO ISSUES AFFECTING CURRENT LICENSEES THROUGH THE WAIVER PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY THE BOARD HAS UTILIZED ITS WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO ENSURE APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES ARE KEPT UP TO DATE OF EMERGING ISSUES. MORE EXAMPLES OF THE BOARD SUCCESSES ARE DETAILED IN THE SUNSET REVIEW REPORTS THE BOARD CONTINUOUSLY WORKS TO ENSURE EFFICIENCY AND ADVOCACY OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AND SURE CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED AND HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING THE PORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS LONG FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I WANT TO INVITE ANY OF MEMBERS HERE IN THE CHAMBERS ARE ON THE PHONES TO- ASK QUESTIONS AND I SEE SENATOR PAN'S HAND IS UP AND WE WELCOME. GOOD SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CALCULATOR AND- AGAIN MY THANKS THE OF FORT FIRST- PRESENTATION I DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BASED ON THE REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED- FIRST OF ALL. IN RELATION TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS SUPERVISION- HE PERHAPS ELABORATE A BIT ON HOW THE BOARD INSURERS- THAT SUPERVISORS ARE. NOT SUPERVISING MORE REGISTRANTS ARE TRAINEES AND AUTHORIZED EIGHT BECAUSE BASICALLY ONE BE SURE THAT. THE SUPERVISORS ARE ABLE TO SUPERVISE APPROPRIATELY AND THE TRAINEES ARE GETTING THE EDUCATION THEY NEED SOMEONE WHO USED TO BE A RESIDENCY TRAINING DIRECTOR I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE SURE THAT ARE. THE FACT THAT FACULTY ARE SPENDING ENOUGH TIME TO THE BILL EDUCATE TRAINEES OF THE TRAINEES ARE JUST SIMPLY LEFT OUT TO DO CLINICAL WORK WITHOUT SUFFICIENT SUPERVISION AND GUIDANCE- AS TO DATE BOTH WITH THEIR OWN EDUCATION ALSO FOR THE QUALITY CARE THAT THE- THAT- OF PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING SO CAN YOU PERHAPS ELABORATED MORE ON- THE ANSWER TO THAT. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. YES I CAN I ANSWER THAT- MANY OF OUR ISSUES THAT WE BROUGHT UP I WAS GONNA MENTION THIS BEFORE- WE ARE WE DO HAVE TO COMMITTEES COMING UP ON THIS ONE WOULD BE DEFINITELY ADDRESSED IN OUR LICENSING COMMITTEE. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A TELEHEALTH COMMITTEE WHICH WE'RE GONNA BE ANSWERING ARE WORKING ON A LOT OF THESE ISSUES BUT IN REGARDS TO THE TRAINING AND SUPERVISION- WE DO RECOGNIZE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE REGISTRANTS AND TRAINEES ARE GETTING YOU KNOW THAT. REALLY. SOUND- SOUNDS. SO HAVE. IN THE LAST YEAR IN THE YEARS BEFORE WE HAD A SUPERVISION COMMITTEE. THE SETTLERS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE LEGISLATION GOING THROUGHAND- SOME OF THAT WILL BE IN PLACE NEXT YEAR IS TO REALLY STRENGTHEN UP- REALLY TO STRENGTHEN UP THE ROLE OF A SUPERVISOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR ROLE IS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPERVISOR HE KNOWS WHAT THEIR SUPERVISOR'S ROLE IS- PART OF THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE MADE- THERE'S GOING TO BE NOW A SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT WHERE BASIC YES SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT- THAT MICHELIN THE SUPERVISOR STARTS THE SUPERVISION. THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE SUPERVISED THE ABOUT. WHAT EACH AND EVERYONE WILL- IN TWENTY TWO. TWO WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY BEGIN. HAVING THE SUPERVISORS REGISTER WITH THE BOARD I'M DOING A- A SELF EVALUATION CERTIFICATION TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY. ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS TO SUPERVISE AND ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A COMPONENT THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE FOR THE SUPERVISOR WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A- WELL ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO DO A REVIEW A YEARLY REVIEW I'LL READ THIS- SO. THAT'S KIND OF HOPING STRAY UP STREET REQUIRE- WE CONTINUE TO DO AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK IN OUR LICENSING COMMITTEES NEXT YEAR. SO A LOT OF THIS IS. SO THAT ANSWERS- SORT OF THE CALL AS PRESHEAF THAT AT ONE OF THEY. THE YOUNG LADY IS KERN PRACTICE I JUST WANTED. IS SO WE HAVE USED THAT'S WILL BE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT AND WILL BE EDUCATING THEM OR BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITIES BUT FOR EXAMPLE. IF THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO RISING TRAINEES AND DETAINEES ARE SEEN PATIENTS. DO YOU HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO ONE LINK BACK- SAY TRAINEES ALL THE PATIENT THAT THE SUPERVISOR DOES NEED TO SIGN OFF THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF THE PATIENT IS A SUPERVISOR SO THAT IF THERE IS A- EVENT THAT HAPPENED OR- THE QUALITY WASN'T THERE. ON THE TRAIN HE AND TO THE TRAINEE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT'S TIED TO THAT. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT- SO I GUESS THAT FIGURED OUT LEVEL KIND OF DOING THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. THERE COULD BE AGREEMENTS THAT CHENEY IS NOT IN A POSITION TO CRITIQUE A SUPERVISOR RIGHT. SO AND TO EXPECT THE TRAINEE TO BRING UP THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE SUPERVISION I THINK IS- PROBABLY NOT A VERY GOOD WAY OF DOING THINGS IT'S- SO. THAT IS GONNA BE IN THE INCUMBENT ON THE BOARD OR THE BOARD THROUGH SOME OTHER TYPES OF YOU KNOW- ORGANIZATION OR AGENCY THAT HAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUPERVISORS SURE THAT THE SUPERVISOR IS DOING THEIR JOB. SO IT'S GREAT FOR THE SUPERVISOR SELF CERTIFIED BUT JUST WHAT THE FEEDBACK LOOPS TO IDENTIFY IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. NO ANSWER- AND I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE WORK BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT A FOCUS OF US AND THAT'S WHAT. I MEAN THE SUPERVISION. REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AND SO WELL DEFINITELY THINK. OKAY OKAY. ANYTHING WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PASS A RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY- THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO THE BOARD. BUT YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE OTHER INTERNAL. PROCESSES AS WELL OKAY- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD CENTER PANICKING HOLDERS ONLY TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND WE CAN SO YOUR NEXT QUESTION BECAUSE I. I WAS ALSO LEFT US A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HOW SUPER VISIT VISION HAPPENS. WITH- AND TELEHEALTH. AND WHETHER THERE'S A BORDERS STAB PROTOCOL IN THE RIVER HE TO SPEAK THIS THE TELE. PARTY THIS IN HOUSE. ACTUALLY WORKS- WELLS I AM SUPER CAN BEING WITH ALLOW SOME SUPER. THROUGH HELLO. TELECONFERENCING BUT IT HAS TO BE FACE TO FACE- VIDEO- SO I'M NOT SURE. THEY STILL HAVE TO READ THEY ARE STILL THEM THE STAFF THERE ARE REQUIRED FOR THE IN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERVISION THE AMOUNT OF HOURS FOR- SUPERVISE HOURS FOR ACTUALLY CLINICAL HOURS IT HASN'T CHANGED THAT WE ARE FOR NEED TO ASK FOR THE CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE WE ARE ALLOWING SOME OF THOSE USED TO BE THEY HAD TO HAVE IN PERSON- FOR SOME OF OUR GROUPS IT HAD TO BE ALL IN PERSON BUT WE ARE ALLOWING SOME VIDEO CONFERENCING. RIGHT SIR HOW ARE YOU HANDLING SUPERVISION- IN THAT TELEHEALTH SPACE- WHAT WE RELY ON- IS BASICALLY THE SUPERVISOR TO. DOCUMENT I MEAN THE SUPERVISOR IN THE SUPERVISOR HAVE TO DOCUMENT THAT THEY ACTION ACTUALLY HAS BE SUPERVISION THROUGH- THROUGH A SUPERVISOR AGREEMENTS AND WEEKLY WEEKLY OUR LAWNS- BUT TO ACTUALLY. WE CAMERA AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THAT AT THIS POINT THAT WE CAN REALLY I GUESS WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY AUDIT HUESO AUDIT THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE WHAT DO YOU HAVE ANY PROTOCOLS AND HOW IT'S TO BE DONE. PROPERLY. WE HAVE NOTHING IN OUR IN OUR LEGISLATIONS REGULATIONS OUT SOME PROPERLY- I THINK THERE'S BEST PRACTICES THAT WE HAVE. I DON'T- WHERE IT SAYS FOR THE WESTERN PROVIDER SHOULD BE DOING THAT'S IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT- BUT WE COULD DEFINITELY CLARIFY YOU KNOW WITH THE TELEHEALTH VIDEO CONFERENCING STUFF DEFINITELY KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THAT SENATOR PAN RIGHT TO THE INTERRUPTED LIKE TO GO BACK TO YOU FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE FOLLOW UP AND I GUESS JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU JUST ASKED ABOUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE PROTOCOLS- THAT- OF. AND INTERNET ACCOUNTABILITY AND AGAIN IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY THE BOARD LEVEL BUT FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW TOOK THE TIME TO SPENDING WHETHER YOUNG TWENTY FACE TO FACE AND ARE QUOTE FACE TO FACE AND A TELEHEALTH OR AGAIN WITH THE PROPRIETOR C. IN PLACE- YOU KNOW RECORDING OF THE INTERACTION WITH REVIEW BY THE SUPERVISOR AND SIGN UP WHAT'S RIGHT TO DO THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT. NEED TO BE DETERMINED AND APPROPRIATE STANDARDS BE ESTABLISHED- THE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION AND QUALITY BECAUSE ULTIMATELY TURNS PATIENT AT THE END TO DESERVES TO GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY NO MATTER WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THEM AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE TRAINEE AS WELL NEED TO BE TRAINED PROPERLY SO THEY CAN DO INDEPENDENT PRACTICE SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD. TO THE FOLLOW UP FROM THE BOARD ON THAT. RIGHT OF DISMISSAL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S PROBLEM ABOUT SPEAK. SO ANY POTS. THE I- CHINA. HELLO IF YOU WISH TO TIENEN THIS RIGHT NOW PLEASED RIGHT NOW OKAY THANK YOU SO JUST A COUPLE ABOUT- THAT- QUALITY AT THE OVER SUPPOSED SO I AM SUPER. YOU KNOW I CAN YOU'LL SEE BY. THAT SOME YOU KNOW THE YOUNG SUPERVISION TELECONFERENCING IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN INDIVIDUAL ALTHOUGH WE ALL OF THIS- YOU KNOW BEING TOGETHER SO- SO QUALITY WISE I CAN GET NOW I CAN BUY EXPIATION EXPERIMENTALLY DOESN'T REALLY GOING TO AFFECT MUCH AND THE SECOND THING IS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SUPERVISION. AND SO- GET UNDER A LAW- THE SUPERVISORS ARE REQUIRED YOU KNOW TO ONE TO TAKE- UNITS OF FROM CONTINUING EDUCATION IN REGARDING LINE ETHICS AND SUPERVISED EXHIBITION IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO UNIFORM LOOKING A SUPERVISOR. AND SO THAT IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THE SUPERVISORS THEMSELVES HAPPY- THE KNOWLEDGE AND ALSO TODAY SOME UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MOST CURRENT PRACTICE AND THE SECOND THING IS THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE YOUNG OF THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE- TRAINEES AND- THE ASSOCIATES- OUR RUN IT ALSO SETS IT WILL GET ON. TO HAVE THREE THOUSAND A SUPERVISED CLINICAL HOURS AND THEY HAVE TO MEET WITH THEIR SUPERVISOR IN AFRASIYAB COUPLE HOURS A WEEK YOU KNOW TO TALK ABOUT CASES AND GET ALL THE CHALLENGES SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS MECHANISM IS VERY VIGOROUS AND YOU KNOW IN MY EXPERIENCE AND I DO IT'S YOUR HOUSE- EXPERIENCE THAT TO GET ONLINE. YEAH NATALIE SUPERVISE SEES UNDER MY WING THEY ARE DEFINITELY GONNA OF QUALITY AND COMPETENCE YOU KNOW TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT JUST DIDN'T. APPRECIATE AND MEDIA ASK YOU QUESTIONS AND YOU ACTION OUR SUPER- WHEN IT COMES TO- THE SUPER THIS IS THIS. ALL SO OFF ON THE CHART SO KNOW WHO'S ULTIMATELY FOR THE CARE OF THAT PAY IN ADDITION TO TRAINEE. SO THE SUPER SUPERVISING IT IN MEDICARE PATIENTS THE SU. IN NAME IS ATTACK TO THAT. FOR THAT THAT PATIENT CARE OF SO TO THE SUPERVISOR ULTIMATE RESPONSE FOR THE OF PATIENTS RECEIVED IS THAT TRUE. WELL SO THE TRAINEE IS DIFFERENT FOR TRAINEES. IT'S I GUESS IT RUNS AND ALL EXAM YOUR PROBABLY EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT CLEARE IT ALSO THE TRAINEE TECHNICALLY IS NOT BEING DONE AROUND THE UNDER OUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED YES AND YET YOU KNOW THERE ENOUGH THAT IS CONSIDERED A PART OF THEIR PRACTICUM AND YES YOU KNOW WHEN THEY- YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S SOME OF THAT THE- THE TRAINEES YOU'RE A PROVIDER SERVICE THEY HAVE TO BE YOU'RE A SUPERVISED. BY THE SUPERVISOR. SO I GUESS I THINK IS A FREE STRAIGHT FOR QUESTION. WHEN A SUPERVISOR. TRAINING WRITING TO A PAY. THE SUPER. ALSO SO OFF ON THE CHART AND THERE FOR TAKES RISK. FOR THE THAT EVEN THOUGH IS. THROUGH A TRAINEE UNDER THEIR SUPERVISION SO THERE IS LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SUPERVISOR FOR THE CARE THAT WAS PROVIDED EVEN THOSE PROVIDED THROUGH A TRAINEE THE SUPERVISORS THAT TRUE. YES OKAY. YEAH AND OUR TIME INTO I THINK THIS. IS AN- THE TRAIN IS ACTUALLY WORK UNDER THE- RIGHT OKAY THAT. STILL IF THERE'S PROBLEM THE SUPERVISORS BASICALLY PUTTING YOUR LIFE ON THE OKAY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WANT TO KNOW AT THAT STOCKTON AND THE DOW. IN THE CARE AND I YEAH LET ME BE CLEAR FOR TH RECORD YEAH THAT'S A ROSE THAT HELPS THE LEAD TO MANAGER JUST SO YOUR IDEAL OKAY I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. AT A POINT ABOUT THE SUIT. AND FUTURE IF I MAY. YES AHEAD OF. I ALSO LIKE TO SAY WE REGARD TO SENATOR CANS QUESTION ABOUT SUPERVISION TELE. MOVING FOR- BUT CALL MAY NEED NOT HAVE A TON OF THE FOR SUPERVISION BE TO TELL. PRETTY COVERED IN COVERT HAS REALLY HIGH SOME AREAS OUR LAW NEEDS CLEAN AND SHE- WITHIN FOR AND BOARD HAS TO STOP ITSELF. CAN AND GOING TO ITS FIRST IS GOING TO BE JANUARY TWENTY IT'S TO BE ON GOING INTO WE CAN COME WITH THAT THE PROPOSAL ADDRESSED OF THE PORTIONS OF THE LAW AND REGULATIONS. THE CLERK SO WE ARE AWARE OF THIS- AND WEDDINGS MOVE FORWARD WITH THE HAVING. DISCUSSION DRESS THEM. THANK YOU THINK I'M MISSING. CENTER PAN OKAY MOVES TO MY NEXT. OKAY THAN ISSUE IS WHY I ACTUALLY UP WITH ALMOST ALL HEALTH FOR BOARDS- HAS TO DO IN COULD. AT. ESTIMATE THAT- IN THE BACK TAPE FIRST OF ALL- AM NOT SO WE JUST REVIEW A THIRD REVIEW TODAY BY YOU HAVEN'T FROM. ANY WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LIGHTS. ARE AT SELECT FOR AN- SO HE SAID RAN NUMBER I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENT IT IS. BUT MORE DISTURBING. IS ALSO. THAT THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF LICENSEES WHO FAILED THE BOARD SEE I DID- FROM S. FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HOURS 27% WHICH IS A FAIRLY LARGE PERCENTAGE AND IN FACT EVEN MAKE NOTE THAT. IS THE MOST FREQUENT. THE MOST FIVE IS COMING VIOLATIONS FOR CITATION ARE NUMBER OF. FAILURE TO COMPLETE REQUIRED C. E. AND THE MISREPRESENTATION OF THE C. COMPLETED. SO THAT WOULD SAY TO ME THAT THE CONTINUING EDUCATION OVERSIGHT IS PERHAPS A BIT PROFICIENT. AND- WE NEED MORE DETAIL ON ON THAT AS WELL SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE PERCENTAGE OF LICENSEES THAT ACTUALLY ARE BEING AUDITED EACH. RENEWAL CYCLE FOR THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION. AND- A THEN A WHAT L. IS IT. WHAT'S BEING DONE WHEN THERE'S A- YOU KNOW A VIOLATION RATE OF 27% AND IT'S WE ARE MOST CUT WHEN YOU'RE MOST COMMON CAUSES FOR CITATION. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THE BOARD IS DOING TO ADDRESS THAT- DEFINITELY AND I THINK I DON'T HAVE THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGES BUT I THINK ONE. IN THE PAST WE WERE DOING ABOUT ONLY A ONE PERCENT- I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS HERE FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE GET FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX. THEY HAVE LIKE A ONE PERCENT- A SAMPLE OR AUDIT- SO REALLY WITH THE FAILURE RATE- WHAT WE'RE- IT'S MOSTLY. LICENSEES NOT UNDERSTANDING FULLY- WHAT ARE THE REQUIRED- C. UNITS THAT THEY HAVE TO GET THEY MAY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THIRTY SIX UNITS THAT THEY HAVE TO GET BUT THEY FORGET SOMETIMES THAT THERE'S A SIX HOUR OF LAWN ETHICS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO EVERY RENEWAL CYCLE AND THERE'S OTHER ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW REQUIRED COURSES FOR THAT FIRST YOU KNOW IT SO THAT'S WERE SEEN I THINK. MOST OF THE- IN THE FAILURE RATES ARE IN THE HOUSE IT'S NOT. COMPLETELY MISSING THIRTY SIX HOURS THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING INSTANCE WE DID GO TO. A WHILE BACK ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I THINK IT WAS WE CHANGED OUR C. E. REQUIRE AS C. E. APPROVAL AGENCIES- THIRTY EIGHT SOME OF THE SCENES THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING DO NOT QUALIFY. FOR OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW I THINK WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS DEFINITELY MORE EDUCATION. MORE NOTICES TO OUR LICENSEES ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH SEEDS. AND WEBER THESE ARE REQUIRED. AND THEN FOR THE AUDIT PURPOSES WE'VE ACTUALLY GONE AHEAD AND WE ARE. THIS YEAR- WE HAVE A NEW POSITION THAT IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE. REALLY. CONCENTRATING ON JUST THE- IN THE- PROCESS WE WILL BE IN THE YEAR. OUR AUDIENCE WILL ACT- BE INCREASING ON THAT SO I'M THINKING HOPEFULLY WITH. FACTORY I MEANING. STAFF MEMBER BEING ABLE TO YOU THAT AUDIT. LAST- BUT IT'S MORE. TO WILL SEEM. WHAT WE SEE YOU KNOW PERCENT FAILURE RATE THE EX OKAY SO I MEAN. IF YOU. ANY ABERRATION THAT ANSWER THAT YOU'RE INVESTING AND DOING THIS IT'S ONLY- DOING 1% AND OF THAT AGAIN FOR THE REASONS USED TO IT I MEAN THAT SOURCE THAT'S REPRESENTS SAMPLE OF THE ENTIRE SO- I THINK OF PERHAPS RATHER BE EXAMINATION OF. WHETHER TO SEE REQUIREMENTS PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING IT THIS LACK OF CLARITY THERE TOO COMPLEX AND MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BE SOME SIMPLIFICATION ADULT LEARNING IS PEOPLE USUALLY. IDENTIFYING THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW COMPLEX YOUR C. REQUIREMENTS ARE BEYOND THE NUMBER OF HOURS I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. HOW MANY RESTRICTIONS YOU PUT ON IT LIKE WHAT TYPES VERSES TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS AND 2 DEGREES THAT- BUT- IS THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED UP BECAUSE OTHERWISE EFFECTIVELY WHATEVER SEE POLICY YOU HAVE IS NOT. BEING CARRIED OUT SO YOU MAKE A GOOD TENSIONS REQUIRE PEOPLE TO DO A CERTAIN TYPE OF C. BUT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. AND SO THAT'S DID SOMEWHERE WE GOTTA FIND IN A AND A BALANCED THERE THE OTHER ISSUE ALSO IS THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE BOARD- NO LONGER ACTUALLY PROVES- SPECIFIC C. E. BUT THEN- GOES THROUGH- THESE VARIOUS. ORGANIZATIONS WHICH- CERTAINLY SEEMS APPROPRIATE BUT I DID- I DO NEED TO ASK IS. IS THERE A BOARD POLICY- IN REGARDS TO CONTENT BE SURE THAT WHATEVER SEE PEOPLE TAKE- THAT THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY THAT- WELL I MEAN IS THAT THERE'S NOT UNDUE COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE ON THE CONTENT OF THE CONTINUED EDUCATION AND CERTAINLY THESE ORGANIZATION MAY HAVE THEIR OWN STANDARDS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE BOARD- TO ENSURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR THAT QUALIFIED SEE BUT I JUST WANNA BE SURE THERE'S A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE C. E. THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING A IS NOT UNDER UNDUE COMMERCIAL INFLUENCE SO- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT- YEAH ACTUALLY I WILL TO GET BACK TO ON. BUT I KNOW FIRST. WITH THE APPROVING AGENCIES WE HAVE A OUR NEW THERE FOR YOU NAY. OR AGENCY SPACE- LICENSE LIES- SORRY AND IN WHAT THE WORD IS LICENSE A ASSOCIATE AND BASED EITHER ONE THAT ACTUALLY IMPROVE YEAH PROOFREADING EDUCATION PROVIDERS THEY HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE FOR UNION AND FOR- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE QUALITY OF SEEDS- WITHIN. WE DO HAVE A IN A REGULATIONS WE DO HAVE IF A NEW PROVIDER APPROVAL AGENCY WANTS TO COME ON BOARD THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THEY MASS- SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT IS IN PLACE I HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE ORIGINALLY WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THESE ASSOCIATIONS THE APPROVAL AGENCIES- I AGREE THAT WE- LOOKED AT THAT AND ADDRESS. THAT BUT I WILL HAVE TO. A WHAT VERSION OF THE DOES HAVE A PA. IS YOU STAY AS THAT YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT TO BE ENSURE THAT THE AND THAT THE BODIES THAT YOU HAVE ASSEMBLY DEFERRED TO TWO. AFFORDABLE C. WHICH IS FINE. ALSO HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY THAT IS. ACCEPTABLE TO THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT- SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING- MEETS THE STANDARDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR PAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE QUESTIONS HERE IN THE CHAMBER ON OUR PHONE LINES AND ZOOM MANY MEMBERS WITH. THEIR HANDS UP PLEASE SO INDICATE. SEEN NINE I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS THEN WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC TESTIMONY- YOU'VE SPOKEN TO THE ISSUE OF TELEHEALTH AND BECAUSE OF IT. THE COVETED PANDEMIC IN. HOW THAT HAS CHANGED OUR WORLD IN SO MANY WAYS CAN YOU- SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THE BOARD HAS EXPERIENCE IN REGULATING. TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS. TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS PER SE I THINK WE CAN HAVE THIS- THAT WAS THE FOCUS FOR ADMINISTRATIVELY- LOOKING AT- THE LICENSE IT'S REALLY IT'S THAT'S RIGHT OR- IT'S HARD TO REALLY. HE SAID THAT- AND PERSONALLY I DON'T KNOW. WE- BECAUSE UR TELEHEALTH REGULATIONS ARE BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LICENSE WITH IN CALIFORNIA- YOU BASICALLY PROVIDE TELEHEALTH- REGULATING THAT IS A BIT TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT IF PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW IN TWO WEEKS- NO PROVIDING TELEHEALTH ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THE LICENSEES ON THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE- WE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH OUR- LICENSE THINGS FROM OTHER STATES- WITH CLIENTS THAT TRANSFER BACK TO CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE FOR SOME REASONS- JUST TRANSFERRING BACK AND THEY WANTED THEY CONTINUE READING CONTINUE READING OF CARE- WORKING WITH THOSE- LICENSEES UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT OTHER THAN A FINE FOR THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE ACT FOR THIRTY DAY TEMPORARY- YOU KNOW TEMPORARY LICENSES THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY TRANSFER YOU KNOW THE CLIENT OVER TO SERVICES WITHIN CALIFORNIA- AND I HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T. USE THAT- SO BEEN OF TOUGH BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE BE LOOKING AT WITH THEIR HELLO HOW- COMMITTEE IS NOW PUTTING IN PLACE OF THE I TEMPER WAIVER OR EMERGENCY WAY FOR LICENSING. AT A WEEK I'M- WELL I HAD THE BOARD'S IN INCOME. ABOUT ON OR APP BAY PROVIDERS IS THERE. FIVE SO. HEY WE REALLY IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU'RE NOT AT THE- IS NOT NICE. GONNA I DON'T THINK THAT I'M I'D HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE IF WE RISK ANY. I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY AND I WE I DO THINK WE REINSTATE. MUCH AND PLANTS ABOUT ALL RIGHT WELL IF YOU. TAKE A AT THAT I. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ON HE TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK THAT. RIGHT I'M SORRY. WELL THEN THERE'S THE BROADER ISSUE OF. DO YOU THINK THAT- THE TELEHEALTH IS- YOU KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS IT A PART OF OUR WORLD AND IT'S USEFUL AND HELPFUL AND- AS A POSITIVE IDEA OF ANY BROADER OBSERVATIONS ABOUT. TELEHEALTH IN YOUR SPACE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE BOARD BUT I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY I MEAN IT IS NEEDED- ESPECIALLY FOR ACCESS AND FOR ME AT THE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT REALLY HELPS OUT SPECIALLY FOR THOSE REMOTE AREAS- THE OTHER THING THAT I LOOK AT- IS THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD INCREASE POSSIBLY THAT ACCESS FOR- YOU KNOW CULTURALLY COMPETENT IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS MANY- THERAPIST MAYBE THAT IS MORE IN LINE WITH THEIR- WITH THEIR JOURNEY IN LIFE AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO SO I DEFINITELY- IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I. PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I THINK IS DEFINITELY NEEDED AND THE EXPANSION OF THAT BUT YOU KNOW REALLY LOOKING AT THE WITH OUR MANDATE PUBLIC PROTECTION DURING NEXT YEAR THE TELEHEALTH REALLY GONNA LOOK AFFECTS YOU. BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THOSE. IT'S REALLY WEIRD NEW WANTS TO DEFINE. FIGURE OUT HOW TO REALLY ENJOY. YOU KNOW THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION IN THIS IN THIS DIVERSE RIGHT. THAT'S WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT. YES NEEDED BUT WITH MORE. NOW WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REALLY REGULATE. ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR OBSERVATION AND OBVIOUSLY WE SHARE YOUR DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT. THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES IN ANY FORM IS TIME IT PROPERLY- WITH THE- WHO ARE PROPERLY TRAINED AND SUPERVISED. I'LL GIVE YOU MY- PERSONAL EDITORIAL. VIEW THAT.
