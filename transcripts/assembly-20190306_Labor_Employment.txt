GOOD AFTERNOON MARC CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. FIFTY ONE AGAIN THIS IS THE BILL -- FROM LAST YEAR IT WAS A JOB KILLER IT IS BEEN TAGGED AS A JOB FOR THIS YEAR THE INTENT AND FOCUS OF THE BILL IS TO ELIMINATE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS FOR LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES. SIGNED AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT PROHIBITS ANY STATE STATUTE THAT LIMITS PROHIBITS OR INTERFERES WITH THE RIGHT TO ARBITRATION. THE LIMITATION PROHIBITION FROM FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION. AGREEMENT AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN DEEMED TO BE PREEMPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS IT'S A HOLY VERSES WHITE MEMORIAL CENTER AND JUSTICE KAGAN WHO WAS APPOINTED BY BARACK OBAMA ALSO STATED IN CANDOR NURSING CENTERS THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES NOT ONLY TO CONTRACTS. ONCE THEIR FORM BUT ALSO HOUSE HOLLY THE COURT WAS EVALUATING AB TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND PROHIBIT AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT REQUIRED. AS A CONDITION OF A CONSUMER CONTRACT FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SPECIFIC CIVIL RIGHT CLAIMS THE COURT STATED THAT THE SPECIAL RESTRICTION ON THE FORMATION OF THE CONTRACT WAS PREEMPTED BY THE FAA. AS A PLACE CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE NOT REQUIRED BALK REMAINS GOVERNOR BROWN STAGE IN HIS VETO MESSAGE THAT A NEARLY IDENTICAL BILL PLAINLY VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW. ADDING PROPOSED SECTION TO AB FIFTY ONE THAT SEATS NOTHING IN THIS LAW EXPANDS UPON THE BASIS TO CHALLENGE A CONTRACT LAWFULLY CREATED DOES NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS IT STILL SEEKS TO INTERFERE WITH THE FORMATION OF AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. WHICH IS PREEMPTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. JUST LIKE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN THIS BILL WILL BE CHALLENGE AND GO THROUGH LITIGATION WHICH IS NOT SERVE THE EMPLOYEE OR THE EMPLOYER ONLY THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. AS DRAFTED AB FIFTY ONE ALSO PROHIBIT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND ADDS A NEW CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT WILL EACH WILL INVITE FURTHER LITIGATION THANKS. THANK YOU IT'S ABOUT FOUR MINUTES FOR THE TWO OF YOU CAN DIVIDE IT UP. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO THE REMAINING WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION -- ARBITRATION IS A FAIR -- AND IT MEANS OF RESOLVING DISPUTES THAT HAS BEEN UP HELD BY A CALIFORNIA COURSE AND BY FEDERAL COURTS. AND THERE IS NOT -- IT'S YOU -- SAY LAWS AND MUST BE FOLLOWED IN ARBITRATION AND MANY OF PEOPLE WHO GO THROUGH ARBITRATION FIND THAT THE QUICKER AND LESS FORMAL NATURE OF IT ACTUALLY MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE THEY GOT THEIR DAY IN COURT EVEN THOUGH THE IN GET THEIR DAY IN COURT IT WAS THEIR DAY IN. ARBITRATION -- AND THERE ARE -- OUR ARBITRATION IS ALSO -- MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE. AND DONE IN A QUICKER WAY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL ENERGY TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU. HI MISTER CHAIR CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION ANOTHER CLIENTS I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOUR NEW CHIEF CONSULTANT ON A PROMOTION. A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS TO NOTE ONE IS. A PROPONENTS MADE THE CLAIM THAT THIS IS BEING PAID FOR BY THE ABUSE OR THE EMPLOYER. THAT IS DUE TO A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH REQUIRES THE IN EMPLOYMENT ONTEXT IN EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION FOR THE EMPLOYER TO PAY ALL OF THOSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ARBITRATION. A SECRET PROCEEDINGS DUE TO LEGISLATION -- BY THEN ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY CHAIR BOB WHAT CAO SKI REQUIRES A QUARTERLY PUBLICATION BY ALL THE ARBITRATION COMPANIES. AND SO WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ARE OF DISPUTE THE AMOUNT THAT WAS AWARDED WHO WON WHO LOST IT CETERA THAT HAS TO BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THERE ARE ON THEIR WEBSITE SO WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT. ARBITRATION AND IN MANY OTHER STATES AND THE CLAIM AS HAS BEEN MADE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IS THAT WERE UNDERMINING SUBSTANTIVE LAWS. JUST BECAUSE YOU SIGNED AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN CHANGE THE UNDERLYING LAW WHERE EMPLOYERS DID ATTEMPT TO DO IT FOR EXAMPLE SHORTENING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THROWN OUT WHERE THERE WAS A CAP OR PROHIBITION ON PUNITIVE DAMAGES THROWN OUT. JUST BECAUSE THERE'S AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOESN'T MEAN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT I COULD -- PAY SOMEBODY LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE OR ELIMINATE ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS ARBITRATION IS A VENUE IT DOESN'T AFFECT SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS TO BUTTER UP MY CHIEF CONSULTANT AS NOTED -- ANY OTHER ANY OTHER A OF FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON OCCURRED WITH IDLE STINK GILBERT ROBESON AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN STAFFING ASSOCIATION IN THE CALIFORNIA STAFFING PROFESSIONALS. ALSO IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSE FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. RETURN MEMBERS MIKE BELOW FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAW COUNCIL OPPOSED THANK YOU. OKAY SO THAT'S A WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- ALREADY A TO MOVE THE BILL THE BILL -- AND YOU HAVE A MOTION A SECOND AND ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HI WE US WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SERVICE WAS ALSO -- I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING. THIS HASN'T BEEN DETERMINED EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WE JUST ONE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS TO ACTUALLY BE VOLUNTARILY ENTERED INTO WE DON'T THINK ARBITRATION IS NECESSARILY BAD. I'M COMING FROM LABOR MOVEMENT WE ACTUALLY OF SUPPORTED ARBITRATION -- BINDING ARBITRATION. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS -- THE FACTS THAT WE KNOW -- AND TODAY IT'S KIND OF FUNNY THAT WERE ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER WHY EMPLOYERS PAY FOR ARBITRATION AND WERE SEEN ON THE NEWS THAT SOME EMPLOYERS IN FACT. CHOOSE NOT TO PAY FOR ARBITRATION AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKERS DON'T EVEN HAVE THEIR DAY IN ARBITRATION SO WHAT USED TO BE USED AS A WAY TO AVOID -- AT TRUE SCRUTINY FOR THE EMPLOYER THERE NOW JUST SIMPLY REFUSING TO EVEN ENGAGE IN OR THEY DON'T ENGAGE IN TIMELY ARBITRATION SO. THAT WE WE WE SEE KIND OF THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL ON WHERE EVEN -- WORKERS AT GOOGLE HAVE FORCED THE COMPANY TO STOP USING THESE AGREEMENTS I I THINK THE WORLD IS CHANGING AS WE SEE IT AND I THINK IT'S TIME -- THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED AND SIGNED WE DO HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR AND SO WERE WHO WERE HELPFUL FOR A FRESH SET OF EYES ON THIS ISSUE -- I I JUST WITH THAT HI -- I WOULD THERE WAS ONE THING I THINK WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT WAS THE MOST COMPELLING REASON. WHY AT ARBITRATION CANNOT? REALLY SATISFY -- A WORKERS CLAIMS. AND I WAS VERY I WAS SHOCKED BY THIS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. SO. YES AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SELF CAN'T CAN'T WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS BUT ONCE IN ARBITRATION IF THE ARBITRATOR GETS THE WALL WRONG IF THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY WRONG THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO APPEAL THAT. THAT THEY JUST SAT EVEN IF THE ARBITRATORS BEEN FOUND IT TO HAVE DISCRIMINATED GETS A WORKER THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND I THINK IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT THE WORLD. THAT THERE SHOULD ALWAYS BE A CORRECTIONS THAT ARE MADE ARE OFTEN MADE IN COURT OF LAW THERE IS -- OFTEN MADE THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES -- WE WE VALUE THAT RIGHT TO APPEAL THAT GETS TAKEN AWAY IN A SECRET ARBITRATION AGREEMENT -- AND SO TODAY I JUST ASK YOU ONCE AGAIN -- TO BUT I ON THIS BILL. OKAY WELL THERE IS A A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL BY SUMMER CARILLO SECOND BY THE CHAIR AND THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIRS AND I A PIECE OF CAN TAKE A LOOK. MOTION IS TO PASS TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CREO. REAL I'D DEEP GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I BONTA. REVERSE. REVERSED HI THAT THE THE BILL IS OUT AND WILL.

SO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THIS BILL MAY SEEM FAMILIAR BECAUSE WE DID SINCE THE THAT LAST YEAR AND IT MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- AND HE VETOED IT SO WE ARE BACK THIS YEAR WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR AND WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS BECOMING AN EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE. THIS BILL TENDS. HOPES TO EXTEND WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION TO CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES WHOSE ROLES INVOLVED RECEIVING AND INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS. SO WE HAVE PATIENT RIGHTS ADVOCATES OUT THERE OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T WORK FOR THE FACILITY THEY ARE CONTRACTED TO SOMEBODY ELSE ARE COMING IN TO INSPECT -- AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS MOST OF THE THE LAWS THAT WE PASS. TO PROTECT WHISTLEBLOWERS THAT IS SEEN AS SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S COMING OUTSIDE OFTENTIMES CONTRACTED OR NONPROFIT COMING IN -- SO THIS JUST EXTENT ESSEX TO EXTEND THOSE RIGHTS. TO CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES OR EVEN VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE COMING IN -- TO TO LOOK AFTER OUR MOST VULNERABLE. AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE WITH ME. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE THREE THREE MY NAME IS SAMUEL JAN AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES WE ARE THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING COUNTY PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND ARE CO SPONSORS OF AB. THREE THREE THREE STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT EVERY COUNTY HAVE A DESIGNATED PATIENTS RIGHTS OFFICE TO RECEIVE AND INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND MONITOR LOCKED PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PATIENTS RIGHTS LAWS. WE SEE HORRIBLE THINGS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF OUR OUR OUR JOB. INCLUDING GROW CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. AND PATIENT DEATHS FROM NEGLECT TO MISTREATMENT. OUR WORK IS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING CONDITIONS AND QUALITY OF CARE WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HOWEVER OUR PROFESSION HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH INSTANCES OF RETALIATION RESULTING IN FEAR AMONGST ADVOCATES THAT THEY MAY LOSE THEIR POSITION FOR CONDUCTING THEIR STATUTORY DUTIES. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR EMPLOYEES OF A CONTRACTED AGENCY. UNLIKE COUNTY EMPLOYEES THESE CONTRACTED ADVOCATES DO NOT HAVE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. OUR DUTIES MAY REQUIRE US TO INFORM STATE LICENSING. ABOUT SERIOUS PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AT A COUNTY FACILITY WHICH ARE COUNTY MAY FROWNED UPON. ADVOCATES HAVE HAD THEIR CONTRACT NOT RENEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF FORWARDING A PATIENT COMPLAINT TO LICENSING. AB THREE THREE THREE WOULD EXTEND ALREADY EXISTING WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES TO CONTRACTORS IN A WATCHDOG ROLE. THESE WOULD APPLY TO OTHER CONTRACTED ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING AN INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

NEARLY A FIFTH OF THE EMPLOYEES CONTACT. UP EMPLOYEES OF CONTRACTED AGENCIES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS CITED CONCERN OVER LOSING THEIR CONTRACT AS A FACTOR AFFECTING HOW STRONGLY THEY ADVOCATE AGAINST PRACTICES AND POLICIES THEY BELIEVE VIOLATE THEIR CLIENTS RIGHTS. THIS IS A COURSE OF SERIOUS CONCERN TO US AS AFFECTS HOW EFFECTIVE THEY CAN BE IN THEIR JOB. ONE SURVEY RESPONDENTS STATED HERE IS NO A TANAMI OR PROTECTION FROM ADMINISTRATORS THAT MAY SEE YOU AS AN ADVERSARY OR THORN IN THEIR SIDE. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR CAN CHOOSE TO DIVERT OR SILENCE THE EFFORTS OF AN ADVOCATE AT ANY TIME. ALL OF US ARE SUBJECT TO UNCHECKED REPERCUSSIONS IF WE RUFFLED WRONG FEATHERS. AND AS SAM YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INSTANCES OF PATIENT RIGHTS ADVOCATES WHO DID NOT HAVE THEIR CONTRACTS RENEWED BECAUSE THEY ADVOCATED. A VERY STRONGLY FOR THEIR CLIENT.

MISTER CHAIR MAP BROWN BE AFTER THE TEAMSTERS EIGHTY YOU MACHINE S. -- I HAVE P. T. LOCAL TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE I YOU KNOW HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THE I ANGER MAY CELIA OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I LEASE IT OUT ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. A DENTIST SEEKING ON BEHALF OF THE CHURCH TAKE COUNSEL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON LAURA CURTIS -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY. WE ARE HERE AN IMPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE EXTENDING THE STATURE LIMITATIONS REDUCES OBVIOUSLY THEY EMPLOYEES OR MOTIVATION TO COME FOR IS THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO RADICALLY THE PROBLEM THESE AT THESE OCCURRENCES ARE LIMITED TO WORKPLACE HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION. SO IF THE EMPLOYER IS NOT MADE AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IN THE WORKPLACE THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACT TO CORRECT IT. EMPLOYERS DON'T WANT HARASSMENT LEAST OUR MEMBERS DON'T WANT HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION OCCURRING IN THE WORKPLACE NOT ONLY FOR THE EMPLOYEE MORALE PURPOSE BUT FOR THE LIABILITY PURPOSES WELL. AND LAST YEAR THIS BILL -- WHICH WAS AN IDENTICAL VERSION AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY MINUTES THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE VETOED THE BILL SAYING EMPLOYEES WHO EXPERIENCE TRESTMAN OR DISCRIMINATION THE WORKPLACE SHOULD HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED. I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE CURRENT FILING DEADLINE WHICH IS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE NOT ONLY ENCOURAGES PROP REPLICA RESOLUTION WILL MEMORIES IN EVIDENCE ARE FRESH BUT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE UNWELCOME BEHAVIOR IS PROMPTLY REPORTED. AND SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS COULD CONTINUE TO GO ON AN OF PLACES THE CONCERNS OF THE VICTIM ON TOP OF POTENTIAL FUTURE VICTIMS WHO MIGHT BE ALSO HARASSED IF NO ONE'S MADE AWARE OF WHAT'S OCCURRING -- AND ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED SUCH A LIMITATION TO SIX TIMES LONGER THAN THE FEDERAL E. O. C. STANDARD THAT'S ONLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS THE CURRENT STATURE LIMITATIONS IS DOUBLE THE STATE'S STANDARD -- OR THE CURRENT SPECIAL IMITATIONS IS DOUBLE THE FEDERAL STANDARD THIS WOULD EXTEND TO SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL STANDARD AND THREE TIMES A STATE STANDARD ALSO THE VICTIM DOES HAVE OTHER AVENUES OF RELIEF NOT ONLY CRIMINAL CHARGES DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE MATTER. BUT YOU CAN ALSO FILE A CLAIM CIVILLY FOR INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS ASSAULT BATTERY AND THOSE DO HAVE A TWO YEAR SESSION WHEN THE PATIENTS -- FOR UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT EMPLOYERS HAVE A DUTY TO NOTIFY ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE ONE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SO THERE IS THAT DUTY AS WELL TO TO NOTIFY THEM OF THAT AND SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE ASKING. FOR THE BILL TO BE LIMITED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ONLY SINCE THAT'S IMPETUS FOR THE BILL AND WE'RE ALSO -- ASKING THAT THE RETROACTIVITY LÏNG. IF I COULD JUST TO REQUEST BECAUSE IT IS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION MISTER CHAIR IN THE IN THE BILL IN SECTION ONE IN SUBDIVISION DE -- IF YOU COULD LIMITED -- TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT THERE INSTEAD OF AS BROAD AS THE CURRENT LANGUAGES. BY THE WAY IT SAYS ARTICLES IT SHOULD SAY ARTICLE. AND THEN IN SECTION TWO WE HAD HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY IN THE OTHER HOUSE IS POLICY COMMITTEE. THE LANGUAGE UTILIZES IT SHOULDN'T BE INTERPRETED TO REVISE. REVIVAL LAPS CLAIMS WE WOULD RATHER HAVE A VERY. EXPLICIT PROSPECT OF STATEMENT THAT THE BILL SHOULD BE AFFECT FOR CLAIMS. FILED ON OR AFTER JANUARY. ONE TWENTY NINETEEN AND LASTLY I THINK WE HAVE SOME GENERAL CONCERN ABOUT WHAT. THE ABILITY OF D. F. E. H.. TO HANDLE EVERYTHING THAT'S LIKELY TO COME -- WITH THIS BILL IF ENACTED. BY THE MOST RECENT DATA WE HAVE SEEN TWENTY THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. OVER FORTY ONE HUNDRED OF WHICH HAVE BEEN DISMISSED DUE TO LACK OF EVIDENCE. THOSE NUMBERS ON BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO GO UP CONSIDERABLY WITH THIS LEGISLATION SO. WE DO UNDERSTAND THE THE POINTS THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS HAVE RAISED WITH IT -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT A MORE LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATION THANK THINKING THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK OF ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. KIM STONE STONE ADVOCACY FOR ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED. THANK YOU. HI THIS PAID BACK. TO THE COMMITTEE -- AND WE ALREADY DO HAVE A MOTION -- THE TO MOVE THE BILL FROM AS A MEMBER BECAUSE ALL SECOND BY SUMMER CARILLO ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SOME RESULTS I JUST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THIS BILL AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU WE KNOW AND I MEAN IT'S ALMOST IN THE NEWS DAILY -- THAT SURVIVOR THE USE -- DEAL WITH IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND AND IT TAKES TIME AND I THINK THAT'S BECOMING MORE MORE CLEAR IN OUR SOCIETY SAID HEAR PEOPLE SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL STANDARD IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WILL SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH FEDERAL STANDARD -- BECAUSE IT IS -- THE EXPECTATION THAT A WOMAN OR MAN WHO FACES THIS WOULD -- REACT EQUALLY AT WITHIN A SHORT TIME PERIOD ESPECIALLY FACING -- JOB LOSS IN BEING A SINGLE MOTHER IN THIS COMPLIMENTS FOR SOME OTHER BILLS WERE DOING AS WELL BUT THANK YOU FOR COMING AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH TO THAT -- I I JUST COMMEND YOU IT'S HARD TO DEAL AND AND WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR SO I'M PROUD OF FOR THIS BILL TODAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THE SERVER DID. IS THIS CHAIRMAN I I ALSO I TOO WOULD LIKE -- TO ECHO -- MISTER DOLLARS IS COMMON -- A NO I THAT I THINK WAS REYES FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I THINK HER WITNESS. FOR US SO FOR FOR HER COURAGE IN COMING -- BEFORE AS PUBLICLY -- TO SHARE HER STORY AND AND AND AND I SEE THAT -- THE THE THE REASON -- BEHIND THIS LEGISLATION IS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL. VIOLENCE OR OR GIVEN THEIR THEIR THEIR TIME AND AND THEY'RE MIDDLE ENOUGH TIME. TO GO THROUGH WITH THEIR EMOTIONAL PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE SEEK WHATEVER JUST AS THE THE SEEM FIT -- I WOULD ASK MISS RAY AS IF SHE WOULD CONSIDER. NARROWING THE SCOPE OF OF HER BILL. TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- CLAIMS -- MEANING -- I'M OF EXTENDING THE THE STATUE OF LIMITATION FROM ONE YEAR TO TWO YEARS -- BUT WHAT WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO LIMIT THAT SCHOOL TO JUST SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND AND ANYTHING HAS TO DO WITH. OF THAT NATURE. I DO WANT -- TO SAY SOMETHING -- THAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED EARLIER THIS BILL MADE IT THROUGH COMMITTEE THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY THROUGH THE SENATE. AND GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. AND THIS WAS THE FORM. SO WE HAD TO WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS PREVIOUSLY AND THIS WAS THE FINAL BILL THAT. WE AS A BODY BOTH PARTIES HAD AGREED -- TO I THINK THAT THAT THE THE LANGUAGE IT'S I WILL CERTAINLY TALK TO TO TO THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THEIR POSITION -- BUT WE HAD. LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS OF LAST YEAR AND ARRIVED AT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS. THE BEST FIT THAT WOULD PROVIDE TO THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE NEEDED -- FOR THE VICTIMS AND THUS WE CAME UP WITH THE LANGUAGE AS WE HAVE IT. IF I CAN ADDRESS THAT -- THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AT COVERS -- CLAIMS OF US GENDER DISCRIMINATION OSMAN ALL TYPES OF UNPROTECTED CATEGORY SO IT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT LIMITATION TO ONLY LIMIT THE BILL TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT BECAUSE A LOT OF CLAIMS THAT COME FORWARD. HAVE INTEREST SEXUALITY WITH OTHER TYPES OF CLAIMS LIKE AGE DISCRIMINATION OR GENDER DISCRIMINATION OR SOME KIND OF OTHER PROTECTION UNDER UNDER FIFA SO TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING. TO HAVE ONE CLAIM IN IN A IN IN ONE LAWSUIT BE THREE YEARS AND AND KEEP THE OTHERS IT'S A MUCH SHORTER TIME SO -- THE BILL PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE CLAIMS UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING -- TO THE THREE YEARS -- AND NOT AND NOT IT'S JUST NOT WORKABLE TO DO IT WITH JUST -- ONE ASPECT OF THE PROTECTIONS AND ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS -- UP THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENT ABOUT THE BILL. I PREVENTING VICTIMS FROM COMING FORWARD QUICKLY ENOUGH. AS YOU HEARD FROM MS SANDERS SHE WENT THE VERY NEXT MONDAY TO REPORT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER I'M IGNORES THE FACT THAT WITH MEN AND AND VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT. DO NOT COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH MENTALLY ALSO THE FEAR AND THE HUMILIATION AND ALL THE OTHER FACTORS THAT PREVENT THEM FROM COMING FORWARD IT IS NOT A BILL THAT'S GOING TO DISCOURAGE. PEOPLE FROM COMING FORWARD THERE ARE REALITIES AS TO WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND SO THE FIX IS TO EXTEND THE STATUTE -- AS FAR AS OTHER REMEDIES THAT ARE THERE LIKE INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS THOSE ARE COMMON LAW CLAIMS THAT TO NOT HAVE THE SAME REMEDY THE PROTECTIONS THAT THE HOUSE. SUCH AS YOU KNOW THE COMMON LAW CLAIMS TO NOT HAVE SO THAT IS WHY IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED WITHIN THE STATUTE. THANK YOU I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I'M I I WANNA -- THANK MY COLLEAGUES WERE OF THE RECOGNITION APPROPRIATE USE OF THE COURAGE. TO COME FORWARD AND SPEAK OF SOMETHING SO PERSONAL AND I THINK IT DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR THIS BILL -- I'M VERY GRATEFUL SUMMARY IS THAT YOU BRING IT BACK AGAIN I'M I'M I'M ARE ALREADY A HAPPY COOPER ON IT BECAUSE I THINK I THINK AS YOU CORRECTLY INDICATED. THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORKED. TO GET IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS A MEANINGFUL BILL -- THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED DURING THE COURSE OF LAST SESSION. I DON'T AGREE WITH GOVERNOR BROWN AT MS A LOT OF REASONS WHY VICTIMS DON'T COME FORWARD RIGHT AWAY. AND AND YOU KNOW HE CAN'T BE RIGHT ON EVERYTHING HE WAS RIGHT ON THIS. ONE AND AS A REALITY AND SO -- I'M TECHNICIANS AND I AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GONZALESSECOND BIKE SUMMER CARILLO AND ALLOW AS MARIA'S YOU HAVE ANY FINAL CLOSING COMMENTS. I WOULDN'T -- JUST REITERATE WHAT TO ON MY COLLEAGUE -- HAS. ALREADY SHARED WITH YOU -- WHEN YOU'RE SIMPLY IS NOT ENOUGH AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT D. F. E. H. IN THE LAWS UNDER THE F. T. H. THEN WE HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THOSE LAWS? AND EXTENDING THE THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S A PERSONAL INJURY HAVE TWO YEARS IF IT'S FRAUD THREE YEARS CONTRACT DISPUTE FOR YEARS. AND THE BANK FRAUD OF UP TO TEN YEARS. GIVING A VICTIM THREE YEARS SHOULD BE THE MINIMUM BUT WE PROVIDE TO THEM AND THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOME AREAS OF THEM SO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE CALL THE VOTE. DO YOU PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NOT VOTING CREO. CARILLO EYES DEEP [inaudible] NOT VOTING [inaudible] NOT VOTING. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I BONTA REVERSE. REVERSE AYE. THE BILL IS OUT. I HAD A HEAD OVER TO APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SERVICE [inaudible] AS SPEAKING APPROPRIATIONS A SUMMER GONZALEZ AND YOU HAVE A COUPLE MORE ABILITY LIKE A PRESENT. BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION THAT IS JUST CLOSE UP DISCOUNT. SELECTION HAS TRANSPORT FOODS -- DECEMBER GONZALEZ AB ONE SEVENTY AND THEN AB ONE SEVENTY ONE IS THAT OKAY YES AB RIGHTLY. AND AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE WITNESSES THAT YOU HAVE FOR THESE TWO ITEMS FOR BEING PATIENT. WE'LL START WITH AB -- ONE SEVENTY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AS THIS BILL YOU ALSO SAW LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY HAD THE NEXT TWO BILLS IN ONE BILL WE'VE NOW -- AS CREATED TWO BILLS OUT OF IT SO -- PEOPLE'S CONFUSION CAN BE LESSENED. HOPEFULLY SINCE THAT WAS THE REASON APPARENTLY IT WAS OF THOSE MOVIES HAVE A TOAD. THANK YOU -- THE ME TOO MOVEMENT WENT A LONG WAY TO PROTECT US INTO FURTHER DIALOGUE ON HOW TO BETTER PROTECT WORKERS HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKERS IN HOSPITALITY AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. ARE OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION AB ONE SEVENTY AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT SEEKS TO PROTECT OUR VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE OFTEN IMMIGRANTS IN OFTEN WOMEN. WHO ARE IN NEED OF THE MOST PERFECT WE'VE SEEN ESPECIALLY A JANITORIAL AND HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES HAS BEEN TOWARD OUTSOURCING WORK TO STAFFING AGENCIES? THESE WORKERS MAY GO TO WORK EACH DAY AT THE SAME LOCATION WHEN THE UNIFORM OF THE OFFICE OUR HOTEL THEIR CLEANING AND REPORTING TO MANAGERS ON SITE. WORKERS ARE IN MANY CASES NOT AWARE OF THEIR JUST SUB CONTRACTING AGENCY OR THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISOR. IN SPITE OF THIS CLEAR TO FACTOR WORKPLACE. AND MANAGERS THESE CONTRACTING COMPANIES AND HOTELS ARE NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE ONE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT HAPPENS ON THEIR WATCH TO THEIR WORKERS WHAT HAS RESULTED FROM THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE HORROR STORIES OF ABUSE IS THE WORKPLACE IS. PERPETRATED BY THE SAME ACTORS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AB ONE SEVENTY WOULD ENSURE THE CONTRACTED WORKERS CAN SEEK RECOURSE FROM BOTH THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYER. AND THEIR CONTRACTING CLIENT EMPLOYER IF THEY EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE. BY REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO SHARE CIVIL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IN CIVIL LIABILITY WORKERS WILL BE MORE POWER TO HAVE THE REPORTS TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND HOLD THEIR ACCOUNTABLE THEIR WORKERS PLACE. THIS BILL WAS INSPIRED BY THE STORY OF TIME PERSON YEARS SANDERS GATHER SCAPA WHO BRAVELY CAME FOR TO TELL HER STORY THE WORLD UNFORTUNATELY -- AS A WORKING SINGLE MOTHER SANDRA WAS AN ABLE TO JOIN US TODAY BUT A FORMER CO WORKER SANDERS WHO FACED A SHOCKINGLY SIMILAR EXPERIENCE OF THE VERY SAME RESORT WILL SHARE HER TESTIMONY TODAY.

HELLO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I'M GONNA NAMES MY MIDDLE AND TRANSLATE THAT HER TESTIMONY SO. OF MINIMUS MONEY GOT SHOT SANCHEZ AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY STORY OF A STALL IN HOPES THAT. AB ONE SEVENTY MOVES FORWARD. I BEGAN WORKING IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AT THE TEN TURNOUT RESORT AS A DISHWASHER THROUGH STOPPING AGENCY CALLED EXCEL. I WAS HARASSED BY A SUPERVISOR WHO ALLEGEDLY HARASSING ASSAULTED ANOTHER ONE OF MY COWORKERS UNENDING FAIL STUDY THAT. SEVERAL MONTHS INTO MY EMPLOYMENT MISSISSIPPI BUT BEGAN TO MAKE SEXUAL ADVANCES TOWARD ME WHILE AT WORK. HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS PRETTY AND THAT HE WOULD HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT WITH ME OUTSIDE OF WORK. I TOLD THEM I WAS NOT INTERESTED. AT ABOUT THAT TIME HE BEGAN TO SCHEDULED TO SHIP THE CONFLICTED WITH MY NEED TO WATCH MY YOUNG CHILDREN. ONE DAY MY SUPERVISOR TOLD ME THAT. I KNEW WAS I KNEW WHAT THE SOLUTION WAS. IF I WANTED BETTER SHIPS. I WAS TERRIFIED. AFTER THE INCIDENT I WANT TO SPEAK WITH TURNING A MANAGER JIMY MARQUEZ AND TOLD HIM WHAT DALE SAID IT MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. JIMMY LAUGHED AT MY COMPLETE. AS FAR AS I KNOW JIMMY DID NOT DO ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE ISSUE. MY EXPERIENCE IS WORKING AT THE TURNING OVER TRAUMATIC FOR ME. WHEN I WAS WORKING THERE AND THEY'LL WAS HARASSING ME HE I FELT SCARED AND DEPRESSED I FELT LIKE I WAS LOAN? EIGHT MORE WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD STORY TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT AT THE CHAIR NEAR RESORT MYSELF INCLUDED. I HOPE THIS BILL PASSES TO GIVE AGENCY WORKERS LIKE MYSELF THE VOICE AND HOLD COMPANIES THAT THE TORNADO RESTORE RESPONSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS SANCHEZ FOR YOUR COURAGE. TO SPEAK FOR US TODAY. STATE MR TURN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION KAREN STRONG SUPPORT AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH US THE ONE AS BRAVE AS MONICA WHO CAME. GIVE ME TO SHARE HER STORY AND WE OFTEN SEE WHEN COMPANIES USE THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE WORKERS THAT THEY TRY TO ASSERT THAT SOMEHOW THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WORKERS GET PAID. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WORKERS ARE SAFE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WORKERS ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT -- FOR THAT REASON WE DID A BILL SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT SAID WHEN A COMPANY USES A THIRD PARTY TO BRING WORKERS TO DO THE REGULAR WORK IN THE BUSINESS. THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IF THOSE WORKERS DON'T GET PAID IF THERE ISN'T A SAFE WORKPLACE IF THEY DON'T HAVE WORKERS COMP PROVIDED AND THAT IS THE LAW TODAY. IT DOESN'T APPLY TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT THAT MEANS THAT THE COMPANY THE HOTEL THAT WAS USING THE STAFFING AGENCY HAS NO FINANCIAL REASON TO INTERVENE. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WOMEN ARE PROTECT. SO THIS THIS WOULD SAY THESE ARE THE WOMEN DOING THE WORK OF YOUR HOTEL YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TURN AWAY AND ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE ABUSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. WE HAVE TO CONSUMERS. JACKIE STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY AND ONE SEVENTY ONE REYES HERE YOU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. MANDY BENSON ON BEHALF OF WORK EQUITY AND AND EVENTS AND CONSULTING AND SUPPORT. WHEN DID YOU SELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT? PAMELA LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF WORK EQUITY IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY AND ONE SEVENTY ONE DOES THE CENTER ABOUT LEGAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. MATT BROUGHT ON BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS UNITE HERE AT YOU -- MACHINISTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE IN OPPOSITION HI LAURA CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY WE ARE HERE AND THEN THE POST POSITION ON AB. ONE SEVENTY THE REASON IS IS THAT THIS STATUTORY MANDATE ARE -- IGNORES AND DISRUPTS LAWS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY IN PLACE FOR THESE PURPOSES SO IF A IF HARASSMENT OCCURS OF THE PERSON PROVIDING SERVICES PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT. UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT AS TO AND IT'S DONE BY A SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE THEN THE CLIENT EMPLOYERS RT STRICTLY LIABLE IF A NON SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE HARASSES SOMEONE. THAT IS PROVIDING SERVICES TO AT PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT THAN THE STANDARD IS KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER WILL ALSO BE HELD PARTY TO THAT CLIENT EMPLOYERS OWN EMPLOYEES. THAN THAT -- KLEIN EMPLOYER WILL BE HELD LIABLE THE THE EMPLOYER ALWAYS HAS THE DUTY TO PROTECT THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES THEY ALSO HAVE A DUTY AGAIN TO PROVIDE TO PROTECT PERSONS PROVIDING SERVICES. PURSUANT TO CONTRACT DEPENDING ON THE STANDARD IT'S KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR IT'S AN S. SIGNIFICAN OUT OF CONTROL OVER THIS INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T EVEN PER DOESN'T EVEN MEET THE STANDARD FOR OR THAT -- DEFINITION FOR PERSONS PROVIDING SERVICES PURSUANT TO A CONTRACT BUT THE CLIENT EMPLOYER IS SEEM TO HAVE -- HAD ENOUGH CONTROL OVER THIS INDIVIDUAL TO ACT LIKE THE REAL PLAYER THEY'RE STILL LIABILITY HOWEVER AB SEVEN ONE SEVENTY IMPOSES JOINT LIABILITY EVEN IF THE EMPLOYEES OF THAT CLIENT EMPLOYER ARE NOT INVOLVED AT ALL. SO IF TO JANITORS THAT ARE IN YOU KNOW A FACILITY THAT HARASS EACH OTHER THAN NOT ONLY IS THE IN THE LABOR CONTRACTOR LIABLE BUT NOW THE CLIENT EMPLOYERS LIABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD NO CONTROL. THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD KNOWN SHOULD HAVE KNOWN KNOWLEDGE AHA ON THE ISSUE THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE HELD LIABLE AND LAST YEAR A SIMILAR BILL OR PROVISION OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE THAT WAS VETOED AND IN THE VETO MESSAGE. GOVERNOR BROWN SAID THIS BILL CREATES NEW ILL DEFINED STANDARDS OF JOINT LIABILITY BETWEEN LABOR CONTRACTORS INCLINE EMPLOYERS PERMITS BOTH ENTITIES FOR MENTALITY AGAINST EMPLOYEE WHOSE FATHER HARASSMENT CLAIM AND ESTABLISHES A THIRTY DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT BEFORE CERTAIN WORKERS CAN FILE CIVIL ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYER. MOST OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ARE CONTAINED IN CURRENT LAW AND ARE THERE UNNECESSARY TO CONSISTENT THAT THEIR NEW PROVISIONS THEY ARE CONFUSING. SO THE CURRENT STANDARD IS WHAT WE THINK SHOULD STILL BE IN PLACE -- BECAUSE AT LEAST THAT HAS THE STANDARD OF EITHER CONTROLLED KNEW HER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR PROVIDES A STRICT LIABILITY IF IT'S A AND A SUPERVISOR EMPLOYEE OF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER THANK YOU. RESEARCHER CHRIS SPECULATE AGAIN I DON'T WANT -- TO IN ANY WAY BE VIEWED AS CONDONING THE ACTIVITY THAT THE AUTHORS WITNESSES TESTIFIED TO I THINK THIS IS A EXAMPLE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THE RIGHT APPROACH THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN. AB ONE THE SEVENTY IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LANGUAGE LABOR CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT TEN POINT THREE WHICH WAS. THE LABOR FEDERATION'S -- ROGER HERNANDEZ SPONSORED BILL -- EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN IF I RECALL THE NUMBER CORRECTLY. THAT WAS FOR THE PAYMENT OF WAGES AND VALID WORKERS COMP COVERAGE FOR THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CONTRACTOR. ITEMS WHICH ARE I GUESS IN MY MIND OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE. AS OPPOSED TO THE LANGUAGE HERE THAT HAS BEEN PLACED INTO THE FIAT STATUTE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE. FOR HARASSMENT WHICH IS NOT AN OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE -- APPROACH. THAT WERE STANDARD THAT COULD BE UTILIZED ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE CONTRACTOR. AND THE OTHER DIFFICULT ASPECT IS IS THAT THE NOTICE IN TRAINING MANDATES CONTAINED IN THE FEE HIGH STATUTE FOR EXAMPLE. DON'T PROVID IF YOU WILL ANY SORT OF GOOD FAITH DEFENSE ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYING ENTITY. I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS OR SOME SORT OF AN APPROACH WITH THE YOU KNOW WHY A BAD THAT THE STATE OF PUTS TOGETHER BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF AN ABILITY. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VERY VALID POINTS THAT MISS CURTIS HAS RAISED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. ENSURING THAT THE EXAMPLE THAT THE WITNESS DESCRIBED DOES NOT GO UNPUNISHED. SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MATTHEW WELL OF WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE WOULD ALIGN OUR OUR POSITION AND WITH AND WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY -- MISS CURTIS CAM MISTER MCKINLEY. THANK YOU.

IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON BROWN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION LIKE TO ALIGN US WITH THE OF FOR OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED BY THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES THANK YOU. THE KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED AS WELL. THANK YOU. CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THAT'S SOME RIGOROUS. SENATE AVENCHES LIGULA LET US AS PART OF ANY. ORDER THAT THIS EAGLE THAT THE LOOK AT MAYBE THEY'LL THIS WSU FREMANTLE. NOISE SELLABLE MONOCLE MORE THE THAT THE ALMA. IT THEM INCENTIVE SICK I CAN PICK IT UP OR YEAH. NEEDLESS TO THE NEXT I WOULD QUE LES SIMPLY SOMEONE SALAS. MOTORS AND ALSO THOSE THAT ARE HOMELESS AGAIN AND CAPITAL IS ALMOST AS A LEVEL. APPLE YONDER Là UMASS ILLNESS A STUDY ABOUT A BULLET -- SUBACUTE CAN GO ANOTHER ORDER YOU LIST ALL THE CALIFORNIA APPLE YET TOTAL THROW A LOTUS KILLED US IN CLINTON AND LET CAKE HE SAYS THE STATE. NOTHING IN THE POLITICAL CONSISTING THAT WILL STEP IN TO GET THINGS. BUT SELECT THE ENABLED US TO SPECULATE WITH GLASSES. THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION. FOR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR YEARS COMING INTO THE CAPITOL TODAY AND BRING THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY INTERESTING. YOU KNOW AS A FATHER OF TWO LITTLE GIRLS -- I KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO IF I FOUND OUT THE SOMEBODY'S DOING THIS MY KIDS YEAH THIS IS INCREDIBLY I'M SERIOUS TO ALL OF US. THERE IS ONE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE AND AS A AND MISS FOSTER THIS IS KIND OF SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW IS MORE DIRECTED AT YOU BECAUSE I IT'S THIS IS NOT AN EASY BILL TO TONOT BE SUPPORTIVE OF BECAUSE IT IS SO INCREDIBLY SERIOUS. BUT ON THAT SMALL BUSINESS SIDE IF IF WE AS AN EMPLOYER WE ARE CONTRACTING SOMEBODY AND YOU KNOW TO HELP US OUT FOR HOWEVER LONG THAT MAY BE. AND WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES PRIOR AND AND I AND THERE MAY BE. NO AS I THINK IT'S ANGIE'S LIST YOU MAYBE THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE WHERE YOU CAN GET -- BACKGROUND ON EMPLOYEE YOU KNOW. BUSINESSES YOU KNOW AS YOU HIRE THEM IN BUT IF WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THAT AND YOU HIRE SOMEBODY IN ON THE GOOD FAITH. AND THEN THEY DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THIS IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO PIN THAT ON THE EMPLOYER. ON THAT HIRING AGENCY AND SO I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BUT IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE THING FOR ME I THINK. YOU KNOW IF IF THIS BILL TAKES AMENDMENTS AND IT DOES BECOME SO EXPANSIVE IT IS VERY SUPPORT. BUT WE CAN'T HOLD PEOPLE IN MY OPINION SMALL BUSINESSES LIABLE FOR ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE ZERO CONTROL OVER SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND AND I WOULD SAY LOOK. WHO'S IN THE BEST POSITION. TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. IS IT THE WORKER THAT'S BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OR THE EMPLOYER EVEN IF THE CONTRACT WAS SOMEONE ELSE TO COME ONTO THEIR PROPERTY. WHO'S IN THE BETTER POSITION AND I'VE AND THAT'S WHY I'M. BECAUSE I THINK CLEARLY AND THERE THE BY AND LARGE OF I DON'T THINK I'LL BE AT ALL I HOPE AGREE THAT. AN EMPLOYER IS IN A BETTER POSITION TO CREATE THAT SAME ENVIRONMENT AND IF THEY'RE BRINGING. OF FOLKS ONTO THEIR PROPERTY AS OPPOSED. TO HAVING THE VICTIMS BE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO IN A NOT JUST WE DEAL WITH THE THE THE SUFFERING. OF BEING VICTIMIZED AND I'LL THE THE HORRIBLE THINGS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT ON TOP OF THAT TO PUT THE BURDEN ON THEM. THAT AND GO TO THE PROCESS OF RAISING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE EMPLOYER THAT'S CONTRACTING -- Và DOESN'T HAVE THE THE THE SAME KIND OF LIABILITY I THINK THAT THAT. PRESSURE FROM THE LIABILITY WELL CLASS ACTION AND CAUSE MUCH MORE OVER KEEN OVERSIGHT AND THERE SHOULD BE OVERSIGHT IF YOU'RE NOT A CONTRACT OUT. CERTAIN SERVICES A LOT OF PEOPLE ON YOUR PROPERTY -- YOU BETTER KNOW WHO WHO'S ON YOUR PROPERTY THAT EVERYONE ON YOUR PROPERTY SAFE AT ALL TIMES AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THAT. THE ONUS SHOULD BE ON THE THOSE THAT ARE IN POWER TO MAKE THE CHANGES AND MAKE THE COULD MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT SAFE. AND NOT ON THOSE THAT ARE BEING VICTIMIZED AT THE LEE ENVIRONMENTS. AND SO FOR THAT FOR THAT REASON THAT RECOGNITION WHICH HAS NINE FEET IN OUR TO GUESS IT. AND IF ANY IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WILL TURN BACK DECEMBER GONZALEZ. SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE QUITE HONEST I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS IN A SMALL BUSINESS CAPACITY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKERS WERE ON YOUR PROPERTY UNDER YOUR CONTROL -- SO IT'S AYE AYE. WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THAT OFF Q. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT HOW THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE WORKPLACE -- I I THINK THAT MAYBE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON ON WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT. LARGELY STAFFING AGENCIES YOU KNOW WHO COME AND AND AND THOSE WORKERS ARE UNDER THE CONTROL AND ON THE LOCATION OF THE I WAS ON THE MASTER EMPLOYER WHICH IS KIND OF OFFENSIVE. DIDN'T YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYER CONTRACTOR -- SO I I I I I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS I I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WARRANTED IN THIS IN THIS ASPECT I WOULD SAY THIS. IF I WAS CYNICAL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THESE BIG COMPANIES ARE -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO LESSEN THEIR OWN LIABILITY FOR THEIR WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY THEIR OWN WORKERS. AND WE'VE SEEN IT. WITH WAGES WE'VE SEEN IT WITH WORKERS COMPENSATION WERE SEEN IT WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SO WE DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE PLAYING WHACK A MOLE YOU KNOW IN TRYING TO GET EMPLOYERS TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS RIGHTFULLY THEIRS THAT WE SAY IS A STATE SHOULD RIGHTFULLY BE THEIRS. AND NOT TO AVOID INCREASE LOOPHOLES -- BITE BY CONTRACTING OUT. IT MAY JUST BE INCIDENTAL IT MIGHT NOT BE A BUSINESS PRACTICE BUT I GUESS WE'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO THE EMPLOYERS TO TO TELL US -- I DON'T WANNA ASSERT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT BUT IT IT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S HAPPENING TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND SO -- WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKER ALL WORKERS ARE SAFEAND BECAUSE OF THIS TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT SITUATION YOU NOT ONLY HAVE WORKERS WHO NORMALLY. WOULD BE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION BECAUSE IT'S SERVICE WORK BECAUSE IT'S OCCUPIED LARGELY BY WOMEN WITH WOMEN OF COLOR -- IMMIGRANTS AS LOWER PAID WORKERS OUT OF SINGLE MOMS A LOT OF TIME IT ARE ALREADY WORD AFFORDABLE SPOT BUT THEN YOU'RE ADDING ONE MORE TO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SUBCONTRACTOR OFTEN NOT UNIONIZED OFTEN NOT -- HAVE A VOICE TO WORK AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY SAY HEY AT THE END OF THE DAY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND HOW DO WE MAKE VICTIMS HOLE. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO JUDICIARY. IN CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THE PAST TWO J. SHERRY KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NO CREO. CARILLO I DEEP. NOT FORTY THIEVES NOT VOTING. GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I BONTA REBUS. LIST ON CALL. THE BILL DOES ON CALLS WILL WAIT FOR ABSENT MEMBERS -- BEFORE WE GET A TERMINATION ON THE BILL. AND AGAIN SANCHEZ THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE SURELY -- AND THEN WE'LL GO ON TO AB. ONE SEVENTY ONE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS. IT'S AGAIN -- THIS WAS PART OF A LAST YEAR AND HAS BEEN PULLED APART -- IN ORDER TO INSURE -- THAT WOMEN IN PARTICULAR BUT ALL WORKERS ARE SAFE ON THE JOB IT'S NO SECRET IN SPITE OF THE GREAT STRIDES WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE REMAINS A PERVASIVE ISSUE ACROSS INDUSTRIES. ESTIMATED 25280% WOMEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORKPLACE AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THOSE NUMBERS GO UP OVER TALK ABOUT WOMEN COLOR IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND WOMEN IN LOW WAGE JOBS. AT THE SAME TIME APPROXIMATELY SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE NEVER REPORTED. THE REASON OVERWHELMINGLY CITED FOR THIS IS FEAR AND I THINK WE HEARD IT EARLIER WITH -- WITH MISS RACES. AS THAT HURT. HER WORKER TESTIMONY IT'S FEAR OF LOSING YOUR JOB IT'S FEAR OF LOSING YOUR HOURS IT'S FEAR BEING LAID OFF ITS FEAR OF BEING ABLE SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY FARE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TIED TO LOSING A JOB. SO RETALIATION INTAKE FORMS IN SO MANY WAYS AND OFTEN WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ARE ON REALLY CHILLED FROM FROM ESTABLISHING THE RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH THEIR RIGHTS FOR WOMEN WHO CAN HIRE AN ATTORNEY AND SUE UNDER FOR YOU HAD THE RIGHT FOR A WOMAN. TO CHANGE THE SITUATION WITHOUT FILING A LAWSUIT -- IS VERY LIMITED IN FACT IT DOESN'T EXIST AB ONE SEVENTY ONE PROTECTS VICTIMS OF WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SOLVE BY GIVING THESE WORKERS THAT SHE'LL THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD. IT WOULD ESTABLISH A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF EMPLOYERS KNOWLEDGE OF THE VICTIM STATUS. I'M SO OF COURSE THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO KNOW IN BEEN INFORMED A SUPERVISOR WOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS HAPPENED AND AND THEN NONETHELESS AT CREATED ACTIONS WHICH PUT THE WORK IN A WEBER SPOT. THE NUMBER ONE THING WE HEARD WE ACTUALLY THIS BILL CAME OUT OF DOING HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND WHAT WE HEARD THE MOST WAS -- AS A SITUATION THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE A RESTAURANT WHERE A SERVER OR OR A DISHWASHER GOES TO TELL -- HER SUPERVISOR LIKE LOOK THE COOK IS PENSION MY BAT SERIOUSLY WAS WHAT WE HEARD MULTIPLE TIMES I DON'T WANT TO WORK WITH THAT CC. AND THE SUPERVISOR SAID OKAY THEN I'M CHANGING YOUR SHIFT. THAT'S RETALIATION AND AND NO WOMAN SHOULD HAVE TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN ORDER TO STOP THAT BEHAVIOR THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES SOMEBODY ELSE'S ACTIONS -- THIS WOULD ENSURE ON THAT THEY HAD THESE RIGHTS IN THAT IT WAS OF COURSE REBUTTABLE I KNOW THE OPPOSITION WILL COME AND SAY AS THEY DID IN THEIR LETTER. THAT SOMEBODY STOLE FROM THE WORKPLACE -- AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY ALSO FILED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS NOT A FORMAL COMPLAINT BUT SAID COMPLAIN THEY CAN BE FIRED THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. YOU ALWAYS CAN BE FIRED IF YOU'VE STOLEN FROM YOUR WORKPLACE -- THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING A READ THE ALL THIS DOES HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A REASON TO FIRE OR TO CHANGE SOMEBODY SCHEDULE OR TO REDUCE THEIR HOURS THAT THAT IS -- ARTICULATE YOU CAN ARTICULATED IN IT SAID NOT BASED ON THE FACTION SO -- WITH THAT I THINK CAN VEGAS MY THANK YOU WITNESS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. AND TODAY MORE THAN EVER I AM REMINDED THAT THE ASSEMBLY LABOR COMMITTEE IS THE BEST COMMITTEE AND THE BUILDING BECAUSE YOU HEAR THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF BILLS. AND TESTIMONY YOU REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A WORKER IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WORKERS FACE AND I FEEL LIKE ANY ONE OF THESE BILLS GIVES YOU A LITTLE PIECE OF IT. BUT TOGETHER THE BILLS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY REALLY CREATE A PORTRAIT OF WHY IT IS SO HARD TO STOP SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THE JOB. PARTICULARLY OF LOW WAGE WORKERS. THIS BILL I BELIEVE IS AT THE HEART OF SOUL MUCH OF THE PROBLEM. WHEN WORKERS REPORT VIOLATIONS THEY GET RETALIATED AGAINST ALMOST EVERY TIME HAVING BEEN A UNION REP HI I AM A LABOR LAWYER WHEN YOU TALK TO WORKERS? EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY REPORT VIOLATIONS THERE IS SOME FORM OF RETALIATION IT IS EXTREMELY WIDESPREAD AND IT IS THE BIGGEST REASON THAT WORKERS DON'T REPORT ABUSE. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD SAY OKAY IF YOU REPORT THAT YOU ARE SEXUALLY HARASSED AND THE NEXT DAY OR FIRED OR THE NEXT WEEK YOU'RE FIRED OR YOU'RE PUT ON THE NIGHT SHIFT OR YOU GET YOUR HOURS CUT? WORKING ASSUME THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS NOW IF THE EMPLOYER HAS A GOOD REASON ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS COME AND PRESENT IT. THE EMPLOYER AS AS I THINK WE'VE WITNESS TESTIMONY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED TO OUR IN WORKED SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE POWER VERY LITTLE VOICE VERY LITTLE RECOURSE. TO ASK OF THEM TO BE ABLE TO THEN PROVE THAT THE ACTIONS THE EMPLOYERS TOOK TO PUNISH THEM FOR SPEAKING OUT WAS RETALIATORY MET SOME STANDARD OF RETALIATION. IS -- NOT ONLY UNFAIR IT'S UNREALISTIC IT CANNOT HAPPEN THE WORKERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE EVIDENCE TO SHOW RETALIATION THE EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY DO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT EVIDENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEBODY. PUTS FORTH THE CLAIM AND THEN THEY GET FIRED AND EMPLOYERS AS IT WAS BAD ATTENDANCE THEY HAVE THE RECORDS TO PROVE THAT IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO SHOW. THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T DESERVE THAT LEVEL OF PROTECTION THEN FOR ONE OF THESE WORKERS WHO HAS ALREADY BEEN VICTIMIZED AND TRAUMATIZED TO THEN BE ASKED TO PROVE THEY DON'T DESERVE TO FACE RETALIATION. I'M IN RESPONSE TO THAT ALLEGATION SO FOR THOSE REASONS FOR HER INSTRUCTS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ALSO SUPPORT. MANY EVENTS AND ON BEHALF OF WORK EQUITY AND MJ BENSON CONSULTING. WHEN AB CELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT? DOES THE CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. WHATEVER OUR O. S. C. I. E. S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ALSO THE TEAMSTERS AND THE CONSUMER JOURNEYS OF CALIFORNIA STEP OUT TO ME DOING FOR THEM. THANK YOU -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON LARA CURTIS AT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCEOF WE ARE HERE IN OPPOSE POSITION ON AB. ONE SEVENTY ONE THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THAT RETALIATION ASIDE FROM THE REDOUBTABLE PRESUMPTION BUT RETALIATION FOR FILING A HARASSMENT COMPLAINT DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT IS ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT IT IS UNLAWFUL FOR AN EMPLOYER TO CURRENTLY. RETALIATE AGAINST SOMEONE THE FILES A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM AND SO THIS IS ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW -- BUT THIS INSTEAD OF AMEND REVISIONS IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND NOW PLACES IT IN THE LABOR CODE SO NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. BEEN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER POTENTIALLY COMING OUT WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS OF REGULATIONS OR SOMETHING ON THAT AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND THAT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COUNCIL WITH THESE POTENTIAL REGULATIONS -- ON RETALIATION GENERALLY AND SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE THE PROVISIONS. REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE MISPLACED AND THAT THEY SHOULD YOU KNOW -- RETALIATION AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT TO REMAIN WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND AND AS MS GONZALEZ -- SAID THERE WAS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE ALL SAID AB THIRTY ONE OF THEM OUR THIRTY EIGHTY ONE SORRY WAS HER ON OF A SEXUAL HARASSMENT BILL THIS TO PROVISIONS FROM THAT. AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED THAT BILL FOR THE REASONS THAT THE PROVISIONS ARE CONTAINED IN CURRENT LAN THEREFORE NECESSARY AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AB FIVE SIX NINE AGAIN TRIED TO PLAY SOME PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN THE LABOR CODE. AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED SAYING THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS REMAIN WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. AND A SIMILAR MATTER WE FEEL THE SAME THING ABOUT A SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS MUCH DIFFERENT IT'S VERY BROADLY DEFINED IT'S NOT SEXUAL ASSAULT IT'S NOT STOCKING. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE THE POLICE ARE USUALLY INVOLVED IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS EASILY IDENTIFIABLE ALL THE TIME IT'S LEERING IT'S GESTURES IT'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT BECOME SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SO DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE IS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN DETERMINING SOMEONE WHO IS A VICTIM OF STALKING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ALL THESE OTHER TYPES OF CRIMES -- AND THANK YOU TO ADDRESS THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT IS A CONCERN OF OURS -- SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN SHIFTING OBVIOUSLY THAT THIS IS A CLAIM THAT THE EMPLOYEES BRINGING AND NOW THIS BURDEN SHIFTS TO THE EMPLOYER IN ORDER TO PROVE. THAT IT WASN'T A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AND AND I DO SAY THAT THE EXAMPLE THAT'S USED OUR LETTER WAS A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS LITIGATING THESE CASES THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ABOUT EMPLOYERS THERE'S ALSO ABOUT EMPLOYEES OUT THERE. SOMEONE DID FILE FALL SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM SIMPLY TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT THEY WERE STEALING FROM THE COMPANY SO THE THINGS UNFORTUNATELY DO HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY IT IS A CONCERN FOR US. THANK YOU -- ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE CHECK ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN STASHED YOUR GROWERS CALIFORNIA CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA CONGENERS IN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTERN AG PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION.

A BRIGHT LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- AND SAYS BRING IT BACK. I BELIEVE EARLIER SOMEONE CARILLO BETWEEN SIPS OF TEA WAS TRYING TO MAKE A MOTION TO THE BILL. OKAY WITH THE BILLS ARE SECOND. SECOND WAS A MEMBER OF BONTA ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- FROM ANY OF THE ABOUT COLLEAGUES UP HERE -- I'LL JUST SAY THAT ONE THANK YOU -- MISSOURI GONZALEZ FOR BRINGING THESE BILLS -- FORWARD AND LOOK AT I THINK WE'VE WE'VE SCREWED UP AS A SOCIETY GOVERNMENT. EMPLOYERS. UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES YOU CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON OVER REALLY GENERATIONS BUT I THINK WE'RE FINALLY COMING TO REALIZATION THAT WE REALLY SCREWED UP AS IT APPLIES TO PROTECTING VICTIMS -- BY WAS A BY THE SIX BILLS TODAY I THINK PLAY A ROLE IN US NOT JUST SAYING WE'RE SORRY BUT TAKING ACTION. ACTUALLY ABOVE EMPOWER VICTIMS TO BE PROTECTED OF FRANKLY HELP EMPLOYERS DO A BETTER JOB PROTECTING THEM BY A AND SO I THINK THAT WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING -- THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS THAT PUTS YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD AS WELL AS THE OTHER BILLS YOU BOUGHT FOR IT -- THIS AFTERNOON THE REASON I RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR -- AND WE'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WENT AND I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN THE LABOR CODE IN THIS IS AN ON GOING OBVIOUSLY -- WHEN CONVENIENT THE DISCUSSION THAT'S BROUGHT UP BY THE CHAMBER WHEN WE HAVE THINGS THE LABOR BECAUSE OF LONG IN THE LABOR BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT AS WELL BECAUSE? IT MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO PRAGUE A THEY DON'T LIKE LAWSUITS THROUGH FEE HER BUT YOU KNOW SO WHATEVER WHEREVER WE PUT THIS THERE'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE. BUT I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHY WE PUT IT IN THE LABOR CODE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN WHO DON'T WANT TO FILE A LAWSUIT. A BY AND FAR. EIGHT THERE'S A CLASS ISSUE GOING ON HERE RIGHT IF I'M IF I'M SEXUALLY HARASSED AT WORK I'M AN ATTORNEY I CAN GO FIND IT I KNOW THE PROCESS I KNOW THE LAW I CAN GO FIND AN ATTORNEY. BUT MOST WORKERS AREN'T EVEN THINKING THAT WAY ALL OTHER THINKING AS I WANT THIS BEHAVIOR TO STOP. I WANT THIS BEHAVIOR STOP IN THE ANSWER SHOULD NOT BE FROM SUPERVISORS AND OUR EMPLOYERS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT THROUGH FIFA. THAT NO WE IN FACT WILL MAKE IT STOP BY MAKING YOU GO AWAY. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT'S THE REALITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND TO SUGGEST THAT THE VERY VERY RARE CASES WHERE SOMEBODY WOULD FILE A FALSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM THAT WE KNOW BYE BYE. THE NUMBERS IS SO VERY RARE FROM THERE AND PLAY OPPOSITION THERE'S NO IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE THAT EMPLOYEE IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION PEOPLE ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM BAD BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY'RE THE RARE ONE WHO -- WHO BASICALLY ENGAGES IN AND FALSE REPORTING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN A LOT WE SHOULDN'T OF? WE SHOULDN'T STOP GOOD LAWS FROM HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THAT ONE SITUATION WHAT WE DO KNOW. IS THESE WORKERS WHO WHO DON'T WANT TO FILE A LAWSUIT WHO DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR UNDERSTANDING OR OR DESIRE IN ANY WAY TO SUETHEIR EMPLOYER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT HERE SO I RESPECT LAST.
