MISINFORMATION --

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:42.936
HAS GONE ON FOR YEARS ABOUT SEE

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.205
WHAT IT'S BEEN THE TOPIC OF SO

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.739
MANY CONVERSATIONS HERE IN THE

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.374
CAPITAL WE'VE ALL HEARD STORIES

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.809
ABOUT SEEK WERE.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.211
THAT IT'S BEEN USED BY SOME

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.180
GROUPS MAY BE NIMBIS OR BUSINESS

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.416
COMPETITORS. TO DERAIL SOME

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.985
MERITORIOUS OF PROJECTS.

CERTAINLY HEARD ABOUT THEM --

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.726
BUT THE THE OLD SAYING THAT MY

STAFF INSISTS THAT I SAY THAT I

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.296
DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.565
THE POOR THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTES

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:18.004
DOES NOT EVIDENCE MAKE.

00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:18.938
APPARENTLY LIKE SAID SAYING.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.707
BY DIAL WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.375
THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.444
EXCEPTION TO EVERY RULE THERE'S

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.246
ALWAYS A HORROR STORY. TO EVERY

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.814
CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHAT'S

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.216
IMPORTANT IS THAT WE GET TO THE

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.751
TO THE OR TO THE TRUTH ABOUT

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:36.389
WHAT IS REAL WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:37.490
AND WHAT IS NOT SO.

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:39.292
WHAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT A AS

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.427
MUCH OF THE OVERALL TRENDS OR

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.363
EMPIRICAL STUDIES BY NEUTRAL

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.231

PARTIES?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.369
WHO HAVE NO FINANCIAL INTEREST

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.703
OR BIAS AND ON THE ISSUE A

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.438
SEQUEL FRANKLY WE'RE TALKING

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.873
ABOUT DEVELOPMENT WE'RE TALKING

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.341
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.544
SUBSTANTIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.846
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.247
A LOT OF ECONOMIC WELL BEING.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:05.051
SO ARE WE REALLY HAVE RECENT

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.220
CHANGES AND SEE HOW THEY'VE BEEN

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.922
WORKING.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.823
EVERY SESSION THERE'S A RUSH. TO

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.959
REFORM SEEK WORK AND A LOT OF US

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.662
FRANKLY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.897
WHAT THIS COMPLEX AND EVOLVING

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.766
PROCEDURAL STATUTE ARE DOING

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.702
TODAY DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT THEY

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.370
DID A FEW YEARS AGO --

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:25.238
ADAM PARDON --

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:27.307
WHICH SOME OF THE INFORMATION

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.810
AND MISINFORMATION IS SPACE SO --

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.345
THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.781
OF WHETHER SHE COULD TRULY IS A

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.783
SOURCE OF PROBLEMS AS SOME

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.785
ALLEGE -- IT

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.620
PARTICULARLY IN OUR AREA OF HIGH

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.522
HOUSING WHERE WE ARE AS WE KNOW

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.325
ABOUT THREE MILLION UNITS SHORT.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:46.993
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.028
WHY SENATOR ALLEN AND I DECIDED

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.530
TO PUT ON THIS HEARING TOGETHER

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.665

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:53.900
ABOUT SEE WHAT.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.169

CHANGES SOME OF WHICH HAVE

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.006
OCCURRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:06.179
AND WHAT ROLE IT PLAYS FAX THE

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.313
IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE WE

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.016
UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE QUIT IS.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.051
HOW IT HAS BEEN STREAMLINED AND

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.720
WHETHER THAT'S WORKING SO WHAT

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.888
WE ARE NOT FOCUSED HERE ON TODAY

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.523
AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IS

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.827
WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON HOW TO FIX

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:21.394
SEEK WHAT?

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:23.329
WE JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.999

THEN PERHAPS ANOTHER HEARING.

AT SOME OTHER POINT IN TIME BUT

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.641
WE WANTED TO MAINTAIN CLARITY --

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.843
AND SO THAT IS THE REASON FOR

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.311
THIS HEARING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:41.280

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.057
THING TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH IS

00:10:58.124 --> 00:10:59.792
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:01.160

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:36.062
THERE IS A SAID LITERALLY

IT'S APPLICABLE WOODY TO LOCAL

REGULATIONS ARE TYPICALLY

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:49.508
THERE'S A SPECIFIC PLANS OF

THOSE PROJECTS TO THE DISCRETION

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.180

DID YOU HEAR ABOUT A LEADER --

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.254
THERE IT VARIES GREATLY BETWEEN

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.324

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.459
WHICH ARE NOT.

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:07.726
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY

00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:08.928
SICK WAS A PROCESS FOR

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:10.162
DISCLOSING POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.897

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:13.399
ACTION TO APPROVE THAT PROJECT

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.034
AS I MENTIONED IT'S NOT A PERMIT

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.302
DOESN'T SUPPLANT.

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.736
EXISTING REGULATIONS IT'S

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:19.438
ESSENTIALLY.

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.273
AN INFORMATION GATHERING --

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.309
PROVISION DOESN'T GRANT AGENCIES

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:25.511
ANY ADDITIONAL POWERS THAN WHAT

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:29.682
THEY ALREADY HAVE SOME MINUTES --

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.916
ANY SORT OF MITIGATION UNDER

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.051
SEQUEL FALLS UNDER THE POWERS

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:32.852
AGENCY ALREADY HAS IT DESN'T

COULDN'T ALREADY DO.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.022
SO SINCE COMMON SECRET TERMS

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:39.959
ESSENTIALLY A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.227
IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

MITIGATE LOW A LEVEL OF

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.011
SIGNIFICANCE THERE'S THIS SORT

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.113
OF CAM HERE I GUESS OF A

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.515
THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANCE SO

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:04.550
YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO TOTALLY

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.117
ELIMINATE THE IMPACTS OF A

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:05.951
PROJECT.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:08.320
BUT INSTEAD TO BRING ITS IMPACTS

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:11.223
TO A LESS THE TWO TYPES OF

THOSE IMPACTS.

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.228
AND THAT IDENTIFIES MITIGATION

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:24.196
MEASURES THAT WOULD REDUCE THE

I USUALLY TAKES AT LEAST A YEAR --

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.753
AND ON SOME PROJECTS MAYBE TO

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.822

DECLARATIONS AND THEN THE THIRD

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:00.666
WAY WOULD BE --

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.568
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS OF

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.670

STATUTE THEY CAN BE VERY BROAD.

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.080
OTHERS AN EXEMPTION FOR REAL

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:20.653
A GRADE SEPARATION YOU CAN DO

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.054
THAT WITHOUT ANY SORT OF SEQUEL

ANALYSIS AT ALL --

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.590
YOU COULD PUT IN TWENTY OF THEM

THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INFILL

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.298
EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE CREATED A

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:35.100
NUMBER OF YEARS BACK ARE VERY --

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.635
AND A LOT OF QUALIFIERS TO THEM

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:37.503
AND BECAUSE OF THAT ARE

00:15:37.569 --> 00:15:39.672
PARTICULARLY USED VERY OFTEN THE

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.440
MORE COMPLEX THE STATUTORY

00:15:41.507 --> 00:15:42.775
EXEMPTION IS KIND OF A GENERAL

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:47.012
RULE OF THE LESS OFTEN THEY TEND

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:47.746
TO BE USED.

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:48.314
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.441
CLEARING HOUSE.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:18.143
THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.278
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY STATUTORY OR

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.580
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE

THAT THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.683
WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.218
THOSE WOULD PRIMARILY BE

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.787
EXEMPTIONS BY STATE AGENCIES.

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:30.622
SO WE EXTRAPOLATE THAT STATE

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:32.858
WIDE TO THE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.326

EXEMPTIONS ARE GRANTED EACH YEAR

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:40.265
IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE TENS OF

BRING THE IMPACTS BELOW A LEVEL

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.295
OF SIGNIFICANCE.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.330
BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO BE

LOCAL PROJECTS WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.590
MANY -- SO

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:39.224
WE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IF

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:41.827
THERE'S ALMOST.

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:10.015
THERE'S NO REVIEW PERIOD --

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:12.117
THE AGENCY SIMPLY HAS TO ENSURE

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:12.918
THAT --

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.186
THERE ARE NO POTENTIAL FOR

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:15.988
IMPACTS IF IT'S A CATEGORICAL

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.022
EXEMPTION --

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:19.057
AND THAT THE PARTICULAR PROJECT

00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:20.559
FITS WITHIN THE THE SCORE FOR

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.394
SQUARE CORNERS OF THE

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:23.428
DESCRIPTION OF THAT EXEMPTION.

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:25.264
OF CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.398
INFILL DEVELOPMENT ARE VERY

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:27.799
COMMONLY USED THROUGHOUT THE

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.568
STATE LESS COMMONLY USED OR

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:33.539
STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS. FOR INFILL

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.139
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:37.309
THERE CHECKS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:38.477
SEAQUEST SO.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.945
IF YOU ARE AN AGENCY THAT HAS

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.013
DETERMINED THAT PARTICULAR

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.548
ACTIVITIES ARE MINISTERIAL

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.049
RATHER THAN DISCRETIONARY --

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.751
THAN SEQUIN NEVER --

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.085
NEVER COMES UP.

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.654
I CREATING MINISTERIAL PERMITS

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.355
THAT HAVE STRICT STANDARDS FOR

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:51.623
DEVELOPMENT OF OR FOLLOWED BY

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.358
EACH PROJECT THAT COMES ALONG IS

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:54.493
AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THE

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.695
NEED FOR SECRECY OF INDIVIDUAL

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:57.796
PROJECTS SOME AGENCIES HAVE DONE

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:59.665
THAT --

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:00.699
OTHER AGENCIES NOT SO MUCH.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.768
ABOUT ONE PROJECT ONE DOCUMENT

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:03.969
IS A PRINCIPLE OF SEQUEL --

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.637
AND NEGATIVE DECORATION

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:06.939
MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATION

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:08.707
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:10.008
PREPARED FOR PROJECT CARRIES

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:11.677
FORTH THROUGHOUT THE PERMITTING

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.779
PROCESS SO THE ORIGINAL AGENCY

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:15.247
THAT WROTE THE DOCUMENT.

00:20:15.314 --> 00:20:16.448
PERMITS THE PROJECT --

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:18.050
OTHER AGENCIES COMING DOWN THE

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.518
LINE FISH AND WILDLIFE --

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:20.886
CALTRANS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:24.389
USE THAT SAME DOCUMENT SO THAT

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:26.658
HELP STREAMLINE THE PROCESS.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.694
UP PROGRAM YOURS IN TEARING OF

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.595
THIS IS USUALLY A TYPE OF THE I.

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:30.963
ARE PREPARED FOR PLAN A

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.264
REGULATION OR MULTI PHASE

00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:34.299
PROJECT AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.233
USED.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.369
IN THE FUTURE --

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:39.037
TO APPLIED IT LATER ACTIVITIES

00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:41.006
THAT ARE WITHIN THAT SAME SORT

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.908
OF PROGRAM THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:45.844
BEEN APPROVED --

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.714
AS THOSE LATER ACTIVITIES OCCUR --

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.248
SOME CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:50.983
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE NEW

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.918
IMPACTS IF THEY'RE NEW IMPACTS A

00:20:52.985 --> 00:20:53.952
SUBSEQUENT.

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.220
IN VINYL IMPACT REPORT IS

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.855
REQUIRED IF NOT YOU GET TO USE

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.423
THE PROGRAM HE I ARE --

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.891
THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING I WAS

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.293
NEVER REOPENED IT'S JUST A

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.494
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.496
LATER ACTIVITY WILL HAVE A NEW

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:06.064
IMPACT THAT HADN'T BEEN COVERED.

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.467
UP PROJECT E. I. OURS CAN ALSO

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:09.801
BE TIERED IN A SIMILAR FASHION.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:13.238
LEADER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:15.140
OF THAT SAME PROJECT.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:15.774
ARE EXAMINED TO SEE WHETHER OR

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.209
NOT THEY WOULD RESULT IN A NEW

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.477
IMPACT OR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:21.246
SEVERE IMPACT IF NOT YOU USE THE

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.314
SAME E. I. R. WAS A VIRGIN

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.682
ORIGINALLY DONE FOR THE PROJECT.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.816
IF THEY WOULD THEN YOU WOULD

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.451
POTENTIALLY PREPARE A SUBSEQUENT

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:28.520
E. I. R. OR SUBSEQUENT SECRET

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.688
DOCUMENT.

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.189
A SPECIFIC PLANS ARE ANOTHER

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.457
METHOD OF USING TEARING IN THE

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.959
EGGS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:34.993
MANNER -- IF

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.828
A SPECIFIC PLAN HAS BEEN ADOPTED

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:38.096
AN E. I. ARE CERTIFIED FOR THAT

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:39.665
SPECIFIC PLAN IN A RESIDENTIAL

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.767
PROJECT PROPOSED THAT'S

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:43.368
CONSISTENT WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:44.536
FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN.

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:45.937
UNLESS THERE'S A NEW IMPACT OR

00:21:46.004 --> 00:21:47.739
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE IMPACT

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:49.441
NOT COVERED IN THE ORIGINAL

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:50.742
SPECIFIC PLAN E. I. ARE --

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.377
THAT AGENCY CAN TO CONTINUE TO

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.046
USE THE SPECIFIC PLAN THE I. R.

00:21:54.112 --> 00:21:55.447
FOR THE LATER PROJECT IF THERE

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:58.984
IS ANY IMPACT ON THE PREPARE A

00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.619
SUBSEQUENT DOCUMENT. FOR THE

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.520
PAST FEW YEARS LEGISLATURE'S

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:02.054
CREATE A NUMBER OF SECRET

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.854
STREAMLINING TEARING MECHANISMS

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.990
INCLUDING NEW EXEMPTIONS WITH

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.291
ENTRANCE A PRIORITY AREAS.

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:06.958
JUSTIN BUT COMMUNITY

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.326
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:10.295
OTHER APPROACHES APPLICABLE TO

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.129
DEVELOPING A TRANSIT PRIORITY

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:11.763
AREAS --

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.165
HOWEVER THESE TEND TO BE MORE

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.933
COMPLEX THAN THE STANDARD

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.501
EXEMPTIONS TO PROGRAM THE I. R.

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:17.703
THE PROJECT THE I. ARE --

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:19.337
ALSO THEY'VE NOT REALLY BEEN

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:22.207
TESTED AND AND SO THEY REALLY

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:24.543
HAVEN'T COME INTO WIDESPREAD USE.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.377
I OFFICE OF PLANNING AND

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.578
RESEARCH HAS WRITTEN A TECHNICAL

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:28.246
ADVISORY COMPARING THESE VARIOUS

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.915
APPROACHES WHICH I'VE ATTACHED

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:31.783
TO MY MATERIALS I'M NOT GOING TO

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.251
GO INTO THEM IN ANY DETAIL

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:34.186
BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THEM IS

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:34.820
UNIQUE.

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:35.854
AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:38.023
RELATIVELY COMPLEX UNTO ITSELF

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.827
IT WOULD TAKE US. TEN HOURS

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:42.427
RATHER THAN TEN MINUTES TO GO

00:22:42.494 --> 00:22:44.596
THROUGH ALL OF THEM.

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.131
YOU'RE SAYING TESTED INCREASING.

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:47.132
WHAT EXACTLY CLOUT CLERK IN

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:48.266
QUALIFIES AS TRANSIT ORIENTED

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:49.434
SOMETHING LIKE THAT GETTING

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:50.602
THOSE DEFINITIONS ARE RIGHT THE

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.337
DEFINITION IS SIMPLE THE TRANSIT

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:53.672
PRIORITY AREAS ARE RELATIVELY

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.240
SIMPLE TO IDENTIFY THEY'VE BEEN

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:57.142
IDENTIFIED ON THE --

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:58.510
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES

00:22:58.577 --> 00:22:59.978
THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY THE

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:00.445
METROPOLITAN PLANNING

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.147
ORGANIZATIONS OTHER ALSO

00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:03.348
ESSENTIALLY JUST --

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:04.349
EVERYTHING WITHIN A HALF MILE

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.384
RADIUS OF THE HIGH QUALITY

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.220
TRANSIT STOP OUR HIGH QUALITY

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:10.222
TRANSIT LINES SO THAT IS NOT

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:11.590
NECESSARILY A PROBLEM WHAT THE

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.058
PROBLEM WITH THE PROBLEM ARISES

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.626
IS THAT --

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:15.961
THERE ARE NUMBER OF QUALIFIERS

00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.229
APPLY WITHIN EACH ONE OF THOSE

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:18.663
AREAS ARE ALSO A VARIETY OF

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.799
DIFFERENT PROCEDURES THAT APPLY.

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.634
SO ONE PROJECT THAT MIGHT WORK

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.503
VERY NICELY TO BE TIERED ON A

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:25.837
SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE FOR

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:30.642
EXAMPLE MAY NOT QUALIFY. FOR ONE

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.377
OF THE STREAMLINING METHODS --

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.311
WITHIN TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS

00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:34.045
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:23:34.112 --> 00:23:35.413
LEGISLATURE'S CHOSEN TO CREATE

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.982
PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.750
WAYS OF TEARING RELATIVELY NEW

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:41.219
WAYS OF TEARING AND ALL OF THEM

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:41.586
ARE DIFFERENT.

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:42.654
AND SO.

00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:43.922
IT'S A QUESTION OF IF YOU'RE A

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:45.323
DEVELOPER IT'S PROBABLY MORE A

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.058
QUESTION OF HOW DO I DESIGN MY

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.226
PROJECT.

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.461
THE FALL WITHIN ONE OF THESE

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:51.463
TEARING METHODS THEN IT IS --

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.231
OF HERE'S MY PROJECT I'M GOING

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:54.966
TO APPLY ONE OF THE TEARING

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:56.134
METHODS TO IT.

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:57.669
SO IT IT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO

00:23:57.736 --> 00:24:00.505
DESIGN THINGS TO FOR UGH JUST TO

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.940
ADD TO THAT AND THEN WHAT I'D

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:03.708
LIKE TO DO IS LET YOU FINISH AND

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:05.443
WE'LL HEAR FROM JUST DISROBING

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.878
THEN HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.480
BUT CHOSE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:09.815
THIS ACT AND DOES IT MAKE IT

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:11.850
EASIER BECAUSE THE PARAMETERS

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:14.252
ARE SET OUT. FOR DEVELOPERS THIS

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.887
IS WHAT THE IF THAT DOESN'T GIVE

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.255
THEM DIRECTIONS SO THAT IT

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:18.657
CREATES GREATER CLARITY AND WHAT

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:20.225
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.760
GET THEIR PROJECT APPROVED.

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:22.928
GOOD QUESTION.

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:24.229
YES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GIVES

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.831
THEM SOME CLARITY AS TO WHAT

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:26.731
THEY NEED --

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.700
PARTICULARLY THE WHAT'S CALLED

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.035
THE SENATE BILL --

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:30.535
TWO TWENTY SIX THAT HAS

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.571
PROVISIONS FOR STATE WIDE --

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:34.206
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND THEN

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:35.574
ALSO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.375
PLAY A PART IN DETERMINING

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:38.009
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR PROJECT CAN

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:39.911
CAN TEAR TEAR OFF OF A PRIOR E.

00:24:39.978 --> 00:24:40.712
I. ARE --

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:45.817
AND SO THAT DOES GIVE YOU A

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.485
CERTAIN LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY A

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:48.386
CERTAIN LEVEL OF CLARITY AS TO

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:49.855
WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WE REQUIRED --

00:24:49.921 --> 00:24:50.822
BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:53.458

UNITS SO IT WAS FOR A RELATIVELY

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.705
LARGE PROJECTS --

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.806

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:50.508
AT ABOUT NINETY IT NAY DECKS

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.377
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOR

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.112
THOSE THAT ARE TEARING OFF OF A

UNITS FOR THE INFILL EXEMPTION

00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:00.552
ONE THING ABOUT THE CATEGORICAL

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:01.886
EXEMPTION FOR INFILL IS THAT.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.421
LIMITS THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:04.889
THAT CAN BE AFFECTED BUT IT

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:05.957
DOESN'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.859
UNITS INVOLVED SO YOU CAN END UP

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:10.061
WITH A LARGER DEVELOPMENTS.

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.997
AFFORDABLE UNITS BENEFITTED FROM

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.365
THE STREAMLINING EXEMPTIONS TO A

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:14.699
GREATER EXTENT TO MARKET EIGHT

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.201
UNITS IN MOST RIVER REVIEWED BY

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.736
TEARING FROM SPECIFIC PLAN HE

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.237
AYE OURS ARE USING THE

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:22.007
CATEGORICAL INFILL EXEMPTION --

00:27:22.073 --> 00:27:23.842
ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:27:23.908 --> 00:27:24.909
SEVEN OUT OF THE FIFTEEN

THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE

EXEMPTION.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.649
SO IT INDICATES AGAIN THAT IT'S

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:33.018
NOT VERY WIDELY USED --

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:34.419

ELEMENTS AND OF THE ONES THAT

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:49.034
WERE DOING BETTER --

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.506
UTILIZED FULL E. I. OURS --

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:55.073
ACTUALLY MORE COMMONLY THAN

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.275
OTHER AGENCIES --

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.076
FINDINGS ON SICK WAS A

00:27:58.143 --> 00:27:59.210
CONSTRAINT WE FOUND THAT THE

SOME PEOPLE OF SIDE WITHDRAWAL

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.487
OF PROJECT DURING SEEK REVIEWS A

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.422

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:12.757
OF SEIZING THE PROCESS OF

00:28:12.824 --> 00:28:14.059
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT --

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.794
BUT WHEN WE ASKED OUR SURVEY

RESPONDENTS ABOUT THIS --

00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:19.297
IN TOTAL THERE WERE FIFTY ONE

PROJECT WITHDRAWALS COVERING

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:23.034
ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS --

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.469
EQUIVALENT TO A WITHDRAWAL RATE

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.104
OF ABOUT TWO POINT 8% OF THE

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.572
TOTAL UNITS IN THE SURVEY.

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.008
WE ALSO DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:32.710
WHETHER IT'S SEEK TOP THREE

AND I'VE HANDLED SEQUEL CASES IN

BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES SO I HAVE HAD

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.786
SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THAT --

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:09.954

I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DO.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.192
TEACH OUR SECRET JUDGES THAT ARE

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.693
DESIGNATED AND COUNTIES OF MORE

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.028
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:20.565
AND WE HAVE AN ANNUAL COURSE FOR

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:25.403
NOT ONLY THE AND THEIR STAFFS SO

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.305
WE DO OUR BEST TO KEEP THEM UP

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:30.041
TO DATE AND TIMELY AND AT

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:31.476
HEARING THESE CASES --

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.544
IN THE LEAST THOSE COUNTIES IN

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:35.980
WHICH SECRET JUDGES ARE REQUIRED

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.081
BY STATUTE.

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:39.150
A COUPLE WORDS ABOUT OF WHAT WE

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:42.286
SEE IN THAT OCCASION --

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.721
FREQUENTLY THERE IS LITIGATION

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:45.957
OVER WHETHER AN EXEMPTION IS

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:48.126
PROPER --

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:48.926
BECAUSE THAT ELIMINATES ALL

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:50.561
SUPER REVIEWS SO OCCASIONALLY

00:33:50.628 --> 00:33:52.063
THEY'LL BE A LAWSUIT OVER

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.866
WHETHER THE EXEMPTION APPLIES IN.

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:58.136
AND IF IT IF THE SUIT NORMALLY

00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.170
AT THE TRIAL COURT DETERMINES

00:33:59.237 --> 00:33:59.837
THAT IT.

00:33:59.904 --> 00:34:01.806
IT DOESN'T APPLY THEM THEY WOULD

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:03.307
NORMALLY GO BACK AND DO THE

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:04.709
REGULAR PROCESS WITHOUT A

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:07.745
SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE PROCESS.

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:10.248
ANOTHER AREA WHICH IS REALLY A

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:11.315
FREQUENTLY.

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:13.418
LITIGATED IS WHEN AN AGENCY USES

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:14.952
AND THEY GET A DECLARATION

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:15.787
RATHER THAN.

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:18.790
AND THEN I RAIL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:21.659
IMPACT REPORT FOR A NEGATIVE

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.761
DECLARATION THIS IS A VERY LOW

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:24.762
STANDARD AND THEN --

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:26.697
IS SOMETIMES IF YOU TAKE THREE

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.765
YEARS LITIGATING WHETHER IN

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.667
NEGATIVE DECORATIONS PROPER AND

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.169
FIND OUT THAT IT ISN'T THEN YOU

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.303
SPEND ANOTHER THREE YEARS DOING

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.471
THE I. R..

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.406
SO MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:36.741
A PROJECT THAT MIGHT HAVE

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:37.975
CONTROVERSY.

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:39.944
AND AND MAYBE A LARGER PROJECT

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:42.680
AND AND GENERATE MORE.

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.682
OPPOSITION IS BUILT DIRECTLY TO

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.851
THE I. R. AND SAVE TIME THE THE

00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:48.119
OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:49.720
IS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT TOO

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:50.922
OFTEN BUT A IF THERE'S AN

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.290
ASSUMPTION THAT ONCE THE CASE

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:54.058
GOES TO THE COURT OF APPEAL IT'S

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.426
ALL OVER SOMETIMES --

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:56.093
WHEN THE?

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.596
WHEN THE DECISION OF THE COURT

00:34:58.663 --> 00:34:59.897
OF APPEAL --

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:00.832
GOES BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.400
THEN THERE'S FURTHER LITIGATION

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:06.604
OVER WHAT THE TRIAL COURT DOES

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.573
THE SECOND TIME.

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.575
EXCEPT THAT THE SOME SOMETIMES

00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:13.578
YOU GET MULTIPLE LAWSUITS BUT IN

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.246
MOST CASES YOU DO NOT IN MOST

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:17.281
CASES THE THE TRIAL COURT'S

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:19.050
DECISION WHETHER IT'S UP HELD A

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:19.517
REVERSE.

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:22.186
NEVER NECESSARILY RESULTS IN THE

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:24.822
OF THE MATTER BEING RESOLVED

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.591
WITHOUT FURTHER LITIGATION --

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.125
BUT THERE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.694
WE HAVE DONE THROUGH.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.262
A JUDICIAL OPINIONS AND I WANTED

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:32.129
TO TALK ABOUT.

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:35.733
A STREAMLINING ISSUES THAT

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.468
SYSTEM FIRST OF ALL.

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.070
A AS THOSE OF YOU OR YOU'RE ALL

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:40.938
LAWYERS YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.473
OBJECT.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.609
TO THE RECORD FOR EXAMPLE ON THE

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.611
BASIS OF PRIVILEGE LIKE ATTORNEY

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:49.080
CLIENT OR EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE --

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:51.249
YOU CANNOT WAIT UNDER THE CASE

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.150
LAW TILL YOU GET TO THE COURT OF

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:54.285
APPEAL AND THEN SAY NOW.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.953
IF THE PRIVILEGE WAS IMPROPERLY

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.421
INSERTED THEN WE HAVE TO START

00:35:57.488 --> 00:35:58.623
OVER AGAIN.

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.124
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BY WRIT AND

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.360
SO YOU CAN'T DELAY THE PROCESS

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.928
BY THAT.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:05.329
THE OTHER THING IS THAT IF IF A

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:06.697
TRIAL COURT OR COURT OF APPEAL

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.266
AFTER REVIEWING THE TRIAL COURT

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:09.166
DECISION.

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.168
FINDS THAT ONLY A SMALL PART OF

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.937
THE I. R. IS INADEQUATE OF FOR

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:16.841
EXAMPLE THE ANALYSIS OF RIPARIAN

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:18.376
VEGETATION WHICH WAS IN THE AD

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.810
IN THE CASE OF MINE.

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.045
THE ONLY PART OF THE I. R. THAT

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:23.147
HAS TO BE FIXED IS THE PART THAT

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.615
WAS EFFECTIVE.

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:25.249
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RE WRITE THE

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.817
WHOLE THING YOU KNOW YOU CAN

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:32.123
ONLY AND YOU CAN FOCUS THEN.

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:33.958
ON REPAIRING THAT DOING THAT

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:34.258
MORE -- IT

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:36.027
FAIRLY AND IN RESPONDING TO THE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:38.663
RED WHICH THE COURT HAS ISSUED

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:41.165
AND THEN MOVING RIGHT ON

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:42.066
SIMILARLY --

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.001
INJUNCTIONS IF ONE ARE IS IS

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:44.235
ISSUED.

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:48.606
A TO THAT PART OF THE PROJECT

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:49.840
WHICH IS SEVERABLE.

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:50.808
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.610
PARKING LOT HAVING AN

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:53.177
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.046
THERE'S A MAJOR CONSTRUCTION

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.514
PROJECT IN ADDITION TO THE

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.115
PARKING LOT.

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:58.649
YOU CAN'T AND THE COURTS

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.518
FREQUENTLY PERMIT THE PROJECT TO

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:01.385
GO AHEAD.

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:02.987
WITHOUT --

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.622
AS TO EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THE

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.257
PART THAT WAS THE SUBJECT TO

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:06.991
LITIGATION.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:09.627
AND IN THIS BY THE SAME TOKEN

00:37:09.694 --> 00:37:10.962
MANY CASES.

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.763
GO RIGHT AHEAD EVEN THOUGH THE

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.666
LITIGATION GOES ON IT IN OTHER

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:16.901
WORDS THEY'RE NOT ENJOYING.

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.736
AND THE BEST EAMPLE LOCALLY

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.171
THAT I CAN THINK OF IS IS

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:22.139
MCANALLY VILLAGE OUT HERE RIGHT

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:23.874
OFF OF BUSINESS.

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.977
EIGHTY WHICH I HAD A LAWSUIT THE

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:28.212
CAME TO OUR COURT AND THE I. R.

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:29.914
WAS FOUND INADEQUATE --

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.716
THEY WENT BACK AND WAS FIXED AND

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.084
THEN THE NEXT DECISION SAID IT

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.119
WAS OKAY BUT MEANWHILE DURING

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:36.687
THE ENTIRE TIME OF THIS

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:37.955
EDUCATION THE PROJECT'S.

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.791
BEEN BUILT THAT'S ALMOST

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.461
COMPLETELY CONSTRUCTED YOU CAN

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.595
SEE THAT.

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:47.031
THE PROCESS IS FREQUENTLY --

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.634
NOT A PROBLEM THE OTHER THING

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.402
ABOUT -- WE

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:53.237
SHOULD WE SHOULD NOTE THAT A LOT

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.839
OF CASES SIMPLY DON'T RESULT IN

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.407
LAWSUIT --

00:37:56.474 --> 00:38:00.711
AND MY FRIENDS WHO TEACH WITH ME.

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:01.646
IN THE END WHO PRACTICE.

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:04.348
FIND THAT OF FREQUENTLY --

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:06.017
CASES CAN BE RESOLVED.

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:07.685
EITHER AFTER THE CASE HAS BEEN

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:10.688
FILED IN COURT OR BEFORE IT'S

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:10.888
FILED.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:14.158
AND I WAS TOLD BY THE LAWYER FOR

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:16.727
THE THE WARRIORS ARENA IN SAN

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:18.462
FRANCISCO THAT.

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:19.730
IT WAS ORIGINALLY LOCATED IN A

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.899
IN A ZONE WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:22.933
JURISDICTION OF THE STATE LANDS

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.801
COMMISSION.

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:25.069
AND EVERYBODY WAS QUITE

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.004
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:29.040
PROBLEMS WITH THE PERMITTING

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:29.707
FROM THE LAST COMMISSION SO THY

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:31.542
JUST MOVE THE PROJECT SO IT NO

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:33.944
LONGER WAS IN THE AREA THE STATE

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.579
LANDS COMMISSION JURISDICTION.

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.548
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:40.685
PROJECTS CAN BE MODIFIED BY THE

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:45.623
PROPONENTS. TO LIMIT --

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:48.292
ON A SIMILAR SITUATION THOUGH

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.694
FREQUENTLY SIGLER LAWSUITS ARE

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.395
ACCOMPANIED BY LAWSUITS ON ANY

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:52.697
OTHER SUBJECTS.

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:53.931
OF VIOLATIONS OF THE GENERAL

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.400
PLAN AND ZONING ISSUES AND AND

00:38:56.467 --> 00:38:57.802
VARIOUS OTHER THINGS SO.

00:38:57.868 --> 00:38:59.570
IT CAN'T BE ASSUME THAT BECAUSE

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.005
YOU MAY HAVE A LAWSUIT THAT IF

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.807
YOU RESOLVE THE SEQUEL PART YOU

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:04.341
RESOLVED ALL THE REST OF IT.

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:06.343
AND THE THEY EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.112
IS THE EIGHT EIGHTY ONE FIFTY

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.814
SENSIBLE OF OUR CASE IN LOS

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.216
ANGELES WHICH IS ONE OF THE AB

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:13.317
NINE HUNDRED CASES WHICH THE

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:14.618
SICK APART RESOLVED AT THE

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.353
HISTORIC BUILDING PART IS NOT

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:21.192
YET RESOLVED.

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:22.526
SO SOMETIMES WHEN SICK WERE.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:23.194
IT WAS ALL OVER AND THEN THERE'S

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.562
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S CAUSING

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.196
PROBLEMS.

00:39:25.262 --> 00:39:26.130
I I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TALK

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:29.100
TO YOU A BIT ABOUT THE AB NINE

00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.301
HUNDRED PROVISIONS WHICH WERE.

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:33.037
ENACTED A FEW YEARS AGO AND IN

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.905
THEIR PRESENT FORM --

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.107
THEY PROVIDE FOR RESERVE

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:38.409
RESOLUTION OF THE LITIGATION

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:39.643
THROUGH BOTH THE TRIAL COURT AND

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.979
THE COURT OF APPEAL.

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:42.613
IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.749
AND WE AT THE COURT SYSTEM

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.717
CONSISTENTLY ADVISE YOU AND WE

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:47.852
WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THAT

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.320
THAT'S TOO SHORT.

00:39:49.386 --> 00:39:51.322
AND IT WASN'T BASED UPON --

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:55.025
ANY CASES BUT RATHER WAS JUST AN

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:56.527
ARBITRARY NUMBER.

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.462
WHICH CAME AND FROM HISTORICAL

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.598
STANDPOINT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:03.868
YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY AN S. A. B. --

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:04.769
NINE HUNDRED PROVIDED THAT THESE

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.737
CASES BE BROUGHT ORIGINALLY IN

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:07.905
THE COURT OF APPEAL WITH

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:09.406
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION --

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:10.708
AND SKIPPING THE TRIAL COURT

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:11.742
ENTIRELY.

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.010
THAT WAS CHALLENGED IN THE

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:16.747
ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT AND AS A

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.082
JUDGE OF THE ALAMEDA SUPERIOR

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.383
COURT RULED THAT IT WAS

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.018
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND TO MUCH TO

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.353
MY SURPRISE THAT EVERYBODY SAID

00:40:22.419 --> 00:40:23.721
OKAY WELL WE'LL JUST CHANGE IT

00:40:23.788 --> 00:40:24.522
AND SO.

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:25.990
THEY ADDED BOTH THE TRIAL COURT

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:27.258
AND THE COURT OF APPEAL PROCESS

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.827
BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE.

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.596
AND BUT THE NUMBERS DIDN'T GET

00:40:32.663 --> 00:40:36.700
ADJUSTED IN AN APPROPRIATE

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:37.268
MANNER SO.

00:40:37.334 --> 00:40:37.835
WE TRY VERY HARD AND WE WILL

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.537
ALWAYS TRY TO COMPLY WITH

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:40.971
WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:41.806
WISHES.

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:44.308
AS OUR GOALS OR REQUIREMENTS BUT

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.176
I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT THE

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:47.044
IT'S IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.713
FOR A COURT. TO MEET THOSE

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.981
REQUIREMENTS AND WITH ALTHOUGH

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.918
THEY ALMOST DID.

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:55.653
AND THEY DID OKAY IN SACRAMENTO

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:57.955
THERE ARE ACTUALLY FEWER ISSUES

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:59.490
IN THOSE LITIGATION THEN.

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:02.960
AND THERE MIGHT APPEAR BUT THERE

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:05.396
IS AND SOME OF THESE AB NINE

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.230
HUNDRED CASES OF ACTUALLY

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:07.665
RESOLVE WITHOUT LITIGATION.

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:09.633
I WAS REMINDED THAT THE APPLE

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.735
CAMPUS IN CUPERTINO WAS IS ONE

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.103
OF THESE AB NINE HUNDRED CASES

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.206
THERE WASN'T ANY LAWSUIT I GUESS

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:15.940
PEOPLE WERE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:16.640
THAT.

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:18.843
ONE BUT SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:21.278
RESOLVE THINGS AND I AND I AND

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:23.013
ONE THING THAT MAYBE IT CAN BE

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.149
DONE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'VE

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:25.482
TALKED ABOUT.

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.618
BOTH THE CENTER ALLEN AND CENTER

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.653
JACKSON IS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.423
TO BEEF UP A LITTLE BIT THE AND

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.124
MEDIATION SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:35.826
OF THE LAW.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:42.132
BECAUSE WE WHEN YOU SHOULD TRY

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.235
TO THE OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.470
SYKORA AND GET PEOPLE TO RESOLVE

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:47.905
THINGS BY DOING SOMETHING

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.673
DIFFERENT THAN.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.108
JUST ALLOWING THE JUDGE DO IT.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.476
WHENEVER YOU YOU HAVE THE COURT

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.211
MAKE THE DECISION THE PARAMETERS

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.846
AVAILABLE TO THE COURT TO MAKE

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:57.314
THAT DECISION A MUCH MORE NARROW

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:58.182
THAN IF YOU.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:00.718
IF YOU ARE FREE TO RESOLVE THE

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.152
MATTER.

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.687
BY ME AS A RESULT OF MEDIATION

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:06.857
OR SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES --

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.659
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN --

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.427
I THINK.

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:13.864
A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE WAY THE

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.532
COURTS OF HANDLE THESE THINGS

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.268
BECAUSE WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY.

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:20.170
AND WE I THINK --

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.039
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A LOT FEWER

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:23.407
THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT I MEAN I

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.375
MAY HAVE.

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:25.943
A SECRET CASE ONCE EVERY COUPLE

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.011
YEARS.

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.245
THEY'RE NOT AS FREQUENT AS YOU

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:29.480
MIGHT EXPECT.

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:30.681
AND WE DO OUR BEST TO GET THEM

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:34.785
THROUGH THE TIME FRAMES WHICH IS

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:36.220
IN THE PRESENT TIME WITH THE

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.489
NINE HUNDRED PROGRAMS ARE REALLY

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:41.091
A VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO US.

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:43.127
TO DO.

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:44.662
I I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:45.496

SPLATTER --

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.716
AND IF WE COULD FOCUS.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:08.419
AGAIN ON OF THE BASIS OF THEIR

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:11.221
TESTIMONY WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:14.158
TO KEEP IT IN THAT CONTEXT SO --

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.393
IF MISTER I SURE IF YOU'D LIKE

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.883
I THINK ALL THIS CAN I JUST JUMP

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:40.851
IN -- MY

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.553
PREVIOUS CAPACITY I WAS A MEMBER

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.922
OF THE A CITY COUNCIL AND THEN

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:49.259
BORDERS WE HAD A LOT OF LAND USE.

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:50.894

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.198
LEVEL.

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:56.233
AND I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.470
OVER TIME --

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.772
IS THAT SEE WHAT HAS --

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:05.042
FRANKENSTEIN.

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.810
IN ITS APPLICATION EN OUR

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:08.445
UNDERSTANDING OF IT IT'S

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.848
FRANKENSTEIN BECAUSE INSTEAD OF

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:13.083
IT BEING AN ENVIRONMENTAL SHIELD

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.785
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IT

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.420
HAS BECOME.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.022
A BIT OF A SORT.

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:20.958
ROLES HAVE REVERSED OVER PERIODS

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.393
OF TIME AT LEAST FROM THE

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.394
INITIAL --

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.396
DESIGN ON HOW IT WAS TO BE

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:26.930

AND THEN YOU HAVE.

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.901
I THINK FOR RIGHT OR WRONG.

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.803
A DANGEROUS MYTHOLOGY.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.071
THAT DEVELOPS.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:36.907
AMONGST FOLKS IN CERTAIN CAN

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.942
BUILDING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT --

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.210
ENVIRONMENTAL.

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:42.846
ON EXACTLY HOW IT IS.

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.148
SO IT THREATENS.

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:46.083
IN DISCOURAGES CERTAIN PROJECTS

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.584
ROM MOVING FORWARD.

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:48.485
WHAT I'VE SEEN AT THE LOCAL

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:50.788
LEVEL WHICH IS BEEN A LITTLE?

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:52.156
UNNERVING.

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.590
IS THAT --

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:55.059
FOLKS WHO ARE CHALLENGING A

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.660
PROJECT.

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:59.530
WELL AS ARE STEAMED --

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:01.265
JUSTICE HAD MENTIONED.

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.800
FIND A WAY.

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:05.102
TO FILE THE SUIT OR THREATEN TO

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:07.204
FILE A SUIT AND BEHIND CLOSED

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.506
DOORS CONCESSIONS ARE MADE.

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.775
AND LO AND BEHOLD GROUPS GO AWAY

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.310
THAT OTHERWISE HAD.

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:15.479
SOME SOME SOME CHALLENGES AND

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:16.046
SOME.

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:18.215
PRESUMABLY MERITORIOUS CONCERNS.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:20.350
BUT I GUESS.

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:21.852
WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE REPORT

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.320
HERE?

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.156
AND IT'S I'M LOOKING AT OUR

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.325
BRIEFING.

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.927
OUR LEGISLATIVE REPORT.

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.229
IT TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:34.731
SIXTEEN BE A URBAN ECONOMICS.

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:35.699
DID A QUALITATIVE QUANTITATIVE

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:39.203
AND THE FLASH YOUR QUESTION ON

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.839
ON THIS.

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.073
I DON'T THINK SO NO.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.274
WHAT WHAT IS IT IN GENERAL I MAY

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.275
HAVE SOME GENERAL I THINK

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:46.610
THERE'S A STATEMENT HERE THAT I

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:49.012
THINK SUMS UP IS THAT THE REPORT

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.614
FOUND QUOTE NO EVIDENCE TO

00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:51.748
SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT SEEK

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.851
REPRESENTS A MAJOR BARRIER TO

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:54.985
DEVELOPMENT?

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.753
AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU TO

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.155
BOTH OF YOU.

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:00.557
IS WE HAD A STATUS STATE.

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:02.893
AND THE GOVERNOR.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.595
TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:07.531
SEQUEL REFORMIST SPECIFICALLY IN

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.133
TERMS OF HOUSING.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.634
AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM YOUR

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.002
TESTIMONY TODAY.

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:14.972
IS THAT SEQUEL IS NOT A MAJOR

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:18.075
IMPEDIMENT TOWARD DEVELOPMENT

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.943
AND THE HOUSING STOCK.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.178
DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE IT WRONG

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:23.447
IN YOUR OPINION.

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:24.648
I WOULDN'T WANT TO SECOND GUESS

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.351
THE GOVERNOR BUT THERE.

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:28.819
I WOULD SAY THAT SECRET AFFAIR

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.387
ADVERSELY AFFECTS VERY LARGE

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.756
PROJECTS CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS --

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.725
HIGH PROFILE PROJECTS BUT IT

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.293
DOESN'T NECESSARILY AFFECT THE

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.661
GREAT GREAT MAJORITY OF PROJECTS

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.163
KNOW WHAT I'D ARGUE THAT IT

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:40.364
AFFECTS --

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:41.665
THERE WOULD HAVE A SAID A MAJOR

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.567
EFFECT ON HOUSING PRODUCTION

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:44.635
STATEWIDE.

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.970
IT CAN BE A CERTAINLY SOMETHING

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.405
IT DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:49.573
FINDING AN APPLICATION BUT IN

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.008
SOME CASES IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:53.277
PROJECT WASN'T VERY GOOD PROJECT

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:54.511
TO BEGIN WITH IT MAY BE THAT IT

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.913
HAD CONSTRAINTS ON THE THAT THEY

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:56.613
HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.118
EVEN FIFTY YEARS IN IN MY

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.419
PRACTICE WE HAVE.

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:03.854
PEOPLE WHO APPROACH US WITH THE

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.155
PROJECT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT IT

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.391
WE REALIZE WHAT GOSH YOU KNOW

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:08.125
YOU'RE ON TOP OF WETLANDS AND

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:09.359
NOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED PERMITS

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.128
FROM CALTRANS FOR A A

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.329
INTERCHANGE.

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:13.997
THE PROJECT SOMETIMES OF ALL

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.599
KINDS OF CONSTRAINTS.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.435
THAT SUDDENLY POP UP DURING THE

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:19.236
SUPER PROCESS.

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:19.870
THOSE SORTS OF CONSTRAINTS CAN

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.538
BE DETRIMENTAL TO A PROJECT AS

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:23.207
WELL SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.441
JUST SECRET.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.642
IT'S SOME CERTAINLY NOT OBJECT

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:27.511
THERE FOUNDED IN THANK YOU SO IF

I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY.

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.448
THAT THERE'S OTHER EXTERNALITIES

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.684
THAT BEAR AS MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.551
TO DEVELOPMENT.

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:36.853
SO THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS ON

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.854
HOUSING.

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:41.325
I UNDER THE RUBRIC OF SEQUEL

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:43.026
REFORM IS MISPLACED.

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:44.161
THAT IS ME I WHEN I CAN ARGUE

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.295
ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:48.398
WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT.

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:51.001
SEE QUIRK AND A AS YOU INDICATED

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.369
MISTER BORCHERS THERE IS A

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:54.871
MYTHOLOGY AND WE'RE HERE TODAY

00:47:54.938 --> 00:47:55.672
TO TALK ABOUT THAT MISSED

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.774
METHODOLOGY AND TO DISPEL IT TO

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.509
THE EXTENT THAT.

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:03.213
IT IS TO SPELL BOLTED TO TO LOOK

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.650
AT THE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.285
THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:09.920
UNDERMINE.

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.322
THE SEQUEL GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.523
THERE'S A YOU WILL IN A MOMENT

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.692
BECAUSE ON THE CHAIR --

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:18.195
IN THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN EFFORT

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.896
TO UNDERMINE SEQUEL BECAUSE HE

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:22.332
DOES IT CAN BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO

00:48:22.399 --> 00:48:24.067
A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE AND

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.236
DEVELOPMENT SO --

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:28.739
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S.

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:31.074
OF POSITION THIS IS AN EFFORT TO

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.110
TRY TO GET TO THE FACTS

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:35.245
ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT IS AND IS

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.213
NOT.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.915
TRUE OR REAL ABOUT SEQUENCE SO

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:39.716
WITH THAT IN MIND PLEASE FEEL

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.852
FREE TO PROCEED I WILL THANK YOU

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.453
MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT. ONE

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.856
OF THE WAYS OF STREAMLINING.

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:46.890
I'LL I'LL TAKE A DIFFERENT

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.892
APPROACH. ONE OF THE WAYS OF

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.327
STREAMLINING --

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:51.995
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH SEEK

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.930
WHILE I NOTICE REALLY SPEAKS

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.065
VOLUMES.

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:58.602
AND THAT IS.

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.270
AN EXEMPTION.

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:01.071
SO INSTEAD OF JUST WORKING

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:02.306
THROUGH THE SYSTEM THERE ARE

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.374
WAYS TO APPLY IT SO THAT IT DOES

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.176
NOT EVEN PERTAIN TO A GIVEN

00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:08.745
PROJECT --

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.514
AND I THINK THE THE GOVERNOR AND

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.549
ALL THIS IS JUST BY REFERENCE WE

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.318
TALK ABOUT THE WITH THE STADIUM

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:16.687
DOWN DOWN THE WAY --

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:18.155
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT SO

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.857
QUICKLY DO YOU DO YOU KNOW?

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.626
THERE HAVEN'T REALLY THAT THAT'S

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:23.960
IS ONE MYTH OF SEQUEL IS THAT

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:24.761
THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.163
EXEMPTIONS FOR STADIUMS THERE

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.332
HAVE NOT BEEN ANY EXEMPTIONS PER

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:29.366
SE FOR STADIUMS ALTHOUGH THERE

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.268
WAS A A LIMITED EXEMPTION FOR

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:34.204
THE OLYMPICS BACK IN.

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.072
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHAT HAS

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:37.107
HAPPENED IS THAT THEY HAVE --

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:37.974
ALLOWED UDER CERTAIN

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.576
CIRCUMSTANCES IN A PARTICULAR

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.178
STATUTES HAVE BEEN PASSED ALLOW

00:49:41.244 --> 00:49:43.680
DEVELOPERS OF STADIUMS TO FRONT

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:45.048
LOAD THE SEQUEL PROCESS THE SICK

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:45.982
AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A REVIEW

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.951
PROCESS FOR DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:48.819
IMPACT REPORTS.

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.754
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO FRONT LOAD

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:54.791
THAT PROCESS BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.626
WHAT COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED --

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.195
THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.464
OFFERED A STREAMLINED LITIGATION

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.765
PROCESS AT THE END OF IT TO THE

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.033
HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ANY

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.068
EXEMPTIONS ABOUT EXEMPTIONS HAVE

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:06.903
BEEN WIDELY USED BY --

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.739
AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE --

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:09.740
TO HELP.

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.842
APPROVED INFILL DEVELOPMENT THE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.410
AS I MENTIONED THE CLASS THIRTY

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.511
TWO EXEMPTION WHICH IS A

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.046
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION NOT A

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:17.714
STATUTORY ONE BUT ONE CREATED BY

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:20.217
THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY.

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:21.718
HAS BEEN BROADLY USED.

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:23.086
IT IS ALSO BEEN UP HELD A NUMBER

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.122
OF K&lt;c.cyan&gt; A NUMBER OF TIMES AND&lt;/c&gt;

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.090
AT THE COURT OF APPEAL.

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.291
SO IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED.

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:30.427
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT EXEMPTION

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.929
IS THAT IT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.064
EXEMPTION.

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:35.932
IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.235
MAY BE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.736
SURROUNDING THE PARTICULARS OF

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.171
OF THE PROJECT SITE OF THE

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:43.640
PROJECT ITSELF THAT SET IT APART

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:44.775
FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS --

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.343
AND THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.978
FOR SIGNIFICANT IN FACT YOU

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:49.079
CAN'T USE THAT EXEMPTION.

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:50.447
THOUGH IT DOES HAVE SOME

00:50:50.514 --> 00:50:51.581
LIMITATIONS ON AS I MENTIONED

00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:52.916
STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS FEWER

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:54.117
LIMITATIONS BUT THESE

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.186
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS TO HAVE

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:57.888
LIMITATIONS ALL FINISHED WITH MY

00:50:57.954 --> 00:51:00.190
LAST TWO QUESTIONS ON ME WILL

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:05.862
POSE IT TO YOUR HONOR --

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.697
YOU MENTIONED THERE'S NOT A LOT

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:09.032
OF LAWSUIT --

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:09.933
AND I'M WONDERING IN YOUR

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.367
EXPERIENCE.

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:11.001
DO YOU THINK THAT --

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.035
PARTIES HAVE BEEN DISCOURAGED

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:14.438
FROM THE PROCESS --

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:15.605
AND THAT IS YOU WANT THAT'S

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:18.108
REFLECTED IN AND HOW.

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:21.912
THERE IS A RELATIVE LOWER NUMBER

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.947
SIX LAWSUITS I WOULD HAVE NO

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:26.450
IDEA I I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:27.984
COMPARED TO THE NUMBER PROJECTS

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:28.852
OUT THERE.

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.153
THERE IS RELATIVELY SMALL

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.322
LITIGATION I DO TEACH WITH SOME

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.924
LAWYERS WHO DEAL WITH SICK WAY

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.858
EVERY DAY.

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.760
AND THEY TELL ME ANECDOTALLY OF

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.361
ALL THE MATTERS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.930
RESOLVED BECAUSE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:41.164
GROUPS HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.066
WITH THE DEVELOPER FOR EXAMPLE

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.869
AND AVOIDING LITIGATION --

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.270
NO AND NOBODY REALLY WANTS THAT

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:48.772
NOBODY WANTS TO COME TO THE

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:51.041
COURTS IF THEY DON'T HAVE --

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:52.609
TO AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT IN A

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:53.810
CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND IT'S TIME

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.512
CONSUMING SO I THINK THERE'S A

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:58.682
LOT OF OF OF PEOPLE WHO RESULT

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:00.951
THINGS OUT OF COURT --

00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:02.452
OTHERWISE IF IF EVERYTHING THAT

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.621
ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS OF OF

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.156
PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SENT

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:06.857
ME TO SEE WHAT.

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.492
WE COULDN'T EVEN OPERATE WE CAN

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.559
DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT SICK WITH

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.695
SO I THINK I THINK THAT IT'S

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.296
TRUE THAT THERE IS A RELATIVELY.

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:14.764
I MEAN YOU SEE.

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.634
LARGE ARTICLES ABOUT IMPORTANT

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.703
ONCE THEY GET CAUGHT BUT THE

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.705
VAST MAJORITY IN MARIN I'M NOT

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:22.339
IN COURT.

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:27.277
I CAN JUST TELL YOU BECAUSE WE

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:27.911
JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MANY CASES

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:28.979
IT [inaudible]

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:35.652
THAT THE THAT THE THE CASE IS

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:38.221
THAT THE THAT THAT THAT YOU'VE

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:39.456
STUDIED WERE THAT HAVE BEEN A

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.824
PART OF THE STUDY.

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:44.594
THAT ENDED THE ENTITLEMENT STAGE.

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.829
FIVE RIGHT YEAH SO DO NOT WILL

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:46.997
NOT NECESSARILY IT ENDED IN THE

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:48.698
ENTITLEMENT STAGE IN THAT WE ASK

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:50.400
THEM WHAT SORT OF ENTITLEMENTS

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.402
THE THE ISSUED FOR THESE. FIVE

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.371
PLUS UNIT PROJECT BUT WE DID

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:55.672
ALSO ASK THEM --

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.340
DID THESE RESULT IN LITIGATION

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:58.508
WHAT SORT OF LITIGATION DID YOU

00:52:58.575 --> 00:52:59.543
HAVE AN EYE SO WINNING THE

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.578
RESPONSE WAS SOMEWHERE Là

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.013
AROUND 1%.

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:05.148
THAT THAT WAS RIPPED PRETTY RARE

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:05.949
THAT THEY ACTUALLY ENDED UP IN

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:08.318
COURT OVER OVER A PROJECT SO

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:09.619
THAT LITIGATION OR THE THREAT OF

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.787
LITIGATION.

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.489
IN THE X. THE MASSIVE EXTENSIONS

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:13.623
THAT WOULD NORMALLY.

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.993
GO ALONG WITH A POST ENTITLEMENT --

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.395
JUDICIAL REVIEW WERE NOT

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:22.899
CALCULATED THE TIME LINE --

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.000
FOR THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE A

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.102
RIGHT IN GENERAL NO NO WANTING

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.971
TO TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT WE

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.040
DON'T KNOW.

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.841
HOW THE THREAT OF A BIG OF A

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:32.242
LAWSUIT --

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:36.313
LITIGATION AFFECTS THINGS

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:39.015
BECAUSE ONE THING TO KEEP IN

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.116
MIND THOUGH IS THAT ONCE A

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:41.551
PROJECT IS.

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:42.652
APPROVED --

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.254
AND IN WHAT'S CALLED A NOTICE OF

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:45.622
THE TERMINATION IS BEEN FILE

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:46.856
THERE'S ONLY A THIRTY FIVE DAY

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:47.924
STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS FOR

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.392
SOMEONE TO BRING A LAWSUIT.

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:51.061
SO SECRET DOES HAVE A RELATIVELY

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.964
SHORT STATURE LIMITATIONS PERIOD --

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.199
THAT MAY IN SOME WAYS DISCOURAGE

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.634
PEOPLE WHO WORK SORT OF LATE

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:58.735
ARRIVALS --

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:00.403
WHO MAY HAVE SOME MISCHIEF IN

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.905
MIND FROM FILING LAWSUITS

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.073
BECAUSE IF THEY HAVEN'T FOLLOWED

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:06.443
THE PROJECT ALL ALL ALONG

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:08.111
THROUGH THE PROCESS? THIRTY DAYS

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:09.179
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:10.046
TO PREPARE FOR THIS BUT THE

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:12.682
STATEMENT OF SEE WHAT NOT BEING

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.151
A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT.

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:17.387
EXCLUDES THE TIME PERIOD THAT

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:18.588
COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.690
POST ENTITLEMENT LITIGATION

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.125
BECAUSE IN THAT'S NOT REFLECTED

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:23.927
IN THOSE NUMBERS THOSE WOULD BE

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.261
REFLECTED THE NUMBERS YEAH.

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:26.396
YEAH BECAUSE WE DID ASSN ABOUT

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.264
LITIGATION AND WHETHER OR NOT

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.633
THERE HAD BEEN LITIGATION NOT

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:30.600
THAT THAT'S NOT MY QUESTIONS THE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.336
TIMELINE EXTENSION BECAUSE OF

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:34.504
LITIGATION.

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:36.239
IS THAT PRESUPPOSED IN THE

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:37.574
STATEMENT THAT IT'S NOT A MAJOR

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:40.110
IMPEDIMENT RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WE

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.578
DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION.

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.079
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:43.747
BUT ALL IN MY THANK YOU SIR

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:48.852

A LOT OF THAT THE PRESENTATION I

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:55.959

BASED LOOK AT SEQUENT THEN THE

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:03.800
MYTHOLOGY.

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.602
PART OF THIS OF THE I'M.

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.537
WHICH STRONG.

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:08.471
STRONG SHE WAS SUPPORTER --

00:55:08.538 --> 00:55:10.974
IN IN LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS IN

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:12.342
THE INFORMATION WHICH WAS

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.844
EXCELLENT AND BASED ON THE FACT

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.680
AND I THINK THE GENERAL JUST

MENTION THAT TO AND YOU'VE

00:55:17.547 --> 00:55:18.848
INDICATED THERE ARE VERY FEW

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:22.419
LAWSUITS THAT COME ABOUT --

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.320
THROUGH SHE QUOTE.

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.622
OF AND I'D LOOK AT ALL OF THE

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.322
REVIEWS THAT SHE COULD DOES

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:26.856
INVITE STATICS AGRICULTURE

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.258
EVERYTHING THAT IS DISCUSSED AND

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:30.026
LOOKED AT BUT WHAT.

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:32.662
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN IN

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.364
GOVERNMENT FOR ABOUT THIRTY

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:35.932
YEARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.401
CITY COUNTY STATE AND IN THE

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:40.236
AREA THAT I'VE WITNESSED I'VE

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:43.440
SEEN VERY FEW ACTUAL LAWSUIT.

00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:44.541
GOING FORWARD --

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:47.977
BUT WHAT I HAVE WITNESSED THAT I

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.412
THINK IT SHOULD FOR THE FACTS.

00:55:49.479 --> 00:55:52.182
IN THE FAX TO ME ARE THAT.

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:54.551

THAT IS IT COMES BEFORE THE

00:55:57.921 --> 00:56:00.090
LOCAL JURISDICTION.

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.791
IT WILL HAVE.

00:56:01.858 --> 00:56:03.526
A SEQUEL REVIEW OF SOME KIND OF

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:06.029
VISION NEGATIVE DECK OR OR ANY

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.397

WILL GO ON AND I SUPPORT PROJECT

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.804
LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH LABOR BUT

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:16.206
THAT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR.

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:20.376
TOOL WHICH USED TO GAIN.

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:21.111
SOME CONCESSIONS FROM THE

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.545
DEVELOPER.

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:25.482
IN LIEU OF THE TWO YEARS HOLDING

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.617
COSTS FOR LAND EVERYTHING ELSE

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:28.918
IT WOULD GO THROUGH THE COST IN

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:32.188
THE TIME THAT WOULD GO. FOR THAT --

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.657
IS AVOID IN AND THEY SETTLED IN

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:35.892
SOME FORM SAME WITH SOME OF THE

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:37.527
IT ANTI COMPETITIVE ISSUES WHERE

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.162
YOU HAVE A BUSINESS YEAR IN A

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.063
BUSINESS THERE.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.931
WILL THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:42.565
AND YOU'LL HAVE A CONSIDERATION

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:44.801
THERE OR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:47.137
I LOVE.

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:49.973
LOVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.241
SOME CASES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:53.076
QUITE GET WHAT THEY WANTED OUT

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:54.077
OF THAT HE AYE ARE.

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:56.246
THAT THEY WILL THREATEN A

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:56.479
LAWSUIT.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:58.882
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS LATER

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.283
OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WOULD BE

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:01.818
A SETTLEMENT AND EVERYONE WALKS

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.987
AWAY. TO SEE COULD DOES WORK

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:05.021
THERE ONLY VERY THERE ARE VERY

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.556
FEW LAWSUITS THAT COME ABOUT AND

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:07.724
VERY CHALLENGES.

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:10.193
BUT IT'S THAT SIDE OF FACT.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.729
IT SEEMS TO BE THE THE THE THE

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:15.532
REALITY FOR MANY BUSINESSES I

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:16.666
DON'T THINK IT'S A MYTH --

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.168
AND AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:20.470
AROUND THAT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:21.704
TO IT I JUST THOUGHT PERHAPS

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:24.307
BECAUSE OF YOUR BROAD

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:26.910
EXPERIENCES YOU MAY HAVE A WAIT.

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.178
TO TO IT TO GET THIS PROCESS TO

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.779
MOVE IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.447
EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T AND ISN'T

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:34.851
INVOLVED IN THE PERHAPS THE THE

00:57:34.918 --> 00:57:35.752
LEGAL SIDE OF IT [inaudible]

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:39.289
AT FIRST.

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.757
YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT ONE OF

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.158
THE THINGS THAT COMES UP I GUESS

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.160
AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT THE

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.662
WHOLE IDEA OF STANDING WHO HAS

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.263
STANDING. TO BRING A SEQUEL

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.865
LAWSUIT CAN CAN MAKE A

00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:51.100
DIFFERENCE IF YOU LOOK AT NEED

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.235
FOR THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.170
POLICY ACT VERSUS SEQUEL --

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:58.007
AND HOW LITIGATION GOES ON SEE

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:58.842
WHAT.

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.243
THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST DEFENSES

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.744
OF THE FEDERAL AGENCY WILL RAISE

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:02.679
IS THAT.

00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:04.547
THE POTENTIAL LITIGANT DOESN'T

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.515
HAVE STANDING.

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:06.716
AND SO THERE AREN'T AS MANY NEED

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:08.451
THE CASES AND CERTAINLY NOT AS

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:09.786
MANY SUCCESSFUL NEED THE CASES

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:11.754
AS THERE ARE SECRET CASE

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:14.057
EQUALIZATION AGAINST AGENCIES --

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.225
SO.

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:17.160
HAS VERY BROAD STANDING A FEW AT

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:17.460
A TAKE --

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.395
YOU NEED.

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.363
YOUR PART OF THE PROCESS.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.232
YOU'RE TAKING ACTIONS ON THE

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.333
BASIS OF ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.734
THE ENVIRONMENT AND ESSENTIALLY

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.202
YOU HAVE STANDING.

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.371
SO THAT MIGHT BE. ONE OF THE

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:29.405
REASONS THAT WE THAT WE HAVE

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.407
THIS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT HOWEVER

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.575
TO DO BOTH TO PROTECT THE

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.177
ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:36.512
LIMIT STANDING IF WE WANT

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:37.614
CALIFORNIA'S VINYL QUALITY BACK.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.317
TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IT HAS

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.752
BEEN IN THE PAST.

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:43.820
CALIFORNIA'S LAWS ON STANDING

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.488
ORDER IN ALL AREAS NOT JUST SEE

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:46.389
BECAUSE I'M MUCH BROADER THAN

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:46.956
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:49.025
FEDERAL LITIGATION.

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:49.959
AND THAT INCLUDES ANY KIND OF

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:54.197
LITIGATION ISSUE THE TO SEQUOIA.

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.832
THE ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT --

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:59.736
AND THE COURTS VERY STRICTLY --

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:01.137
REQUIRE YOU TO EXHAUST YOUR

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:03.373
MYSTERY REMEDIES UNDER SYKORA.

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:05.508
SO YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.677
GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN THE VERY

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:08.344
BEGINNING YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR

00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:10.613
POINTS WELL YOU CAN'T RAISE THEM

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.081
ON APPEAL.

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:12.882
YOU CAN'T REASON AT THE TRIAL

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:15.752
COURT AND FOR THAT MATTER --

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:18.021
AND SO -- IT

00:59:18.087 --> 00:59:19.522
WE DO THAT LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:23.793
CASES ON REGULARLY ON ON FAILING

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:24.994
TO EXHAUST --

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.329
AND THAT THAT THAT CAN BE AND

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.931
YOU HAVE TO EXHAUST BY RAISING

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.832
AN ISSUE.

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.067
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I'M GONNA

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:33.036
MAKE MENTION ONE ISSUE NOW WHEN

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.537
I GET.

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.171
ON APPEAL I CAN RAISE NINE MORE

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.606
YOU AT YOUR LIMITED TO THE

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:38.708
ACTUAL ISSUES YOU RAISED BEFORE

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:40.710
THE AGENCY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:42.312
IF EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS BUT

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.479
WHEN THE COURT THE BOTH THE

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.080
TRIAL COURT AND THE APPELLATE

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:44.747
COURT.

00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:47.250
WE REVIEW THE AGENCY'S DECISION

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:48.751
AND FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE COURT

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:51.387
OF APPEAL REVIEWS A CASE WE SKIP

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.789
OVER THE TRIAL COURT AND WE GO

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.958
DIRECTLY TO THE AGENCY AND SAY.

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.093
DID THE AGENCY DO IT RIGHT I

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.261
MEAN IT'S ALWAYS USEFUL TO HAVE

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.330
A TRIAL COURT'S RULING TO HELP

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.065
US BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:05.068
BUT SO.

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.270
YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE HAPPENS IN

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:12.275
COURT.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.010
SENATOR Y. KOWSKI.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:15.712
JUST FOR CLARIFICATION BECAUSE

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.046
THERE ARE SOME NON LAWYERS HERE

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:18.781
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STANDING TO

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.050
&lt;c.green&gt;RING THE LAWSUIT NOT THE WHOLE&lt;/c&gt;

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.386
LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL REFER THE

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.321
VIEW PROCESS I THINK THERE AT

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:25.855
THAT.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.824
A MISC AND DISCONNECT BETWEEN

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.659
THE SEEK WHAT PROCESS WHICH IS

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.761
THE GOLDEN WORDS AND THE CLEAN

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.196
AIR ACT THE CLEAN WATER ACT THE

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:35.164
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND THE

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:38.868
UNDERLYING LAW THAT PEOPLE USE

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.536
WHEN WE HAVE THIS. ONE TENT

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:43.339
EXPOSURE TO WHAT THE PROJECT IS

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.074
I MEAN THEY THEY HAVE STANDING

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:46.542
IN FROM THE CITY COUNCIL FROM

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.710
THE COUNTY FOR THE

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.412
ADMINISTRATIVE IS JUST IF THEY

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.647
WANT TO FILE A SUIT.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:54.684
THAT'S A VERY NARROW.

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.486
TIME IN THE DEBATE TO GET.

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:59.422
ANY IS HAS A IT HAS A LEGAL.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.657
LEGAL DEFINITION RIGHT AND IT'S

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.459
BUT CALIFORNIA STANDING IS

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:04.093
BROUGHT IF YOU WANT TO BRING A

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.395
CHALLENGE TO A WATER BOARD

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.363
DECISION OR YOUR BOARD DECISION

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.365
STANDING IS WATER IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:12.969
THAT WOULD BE UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:14.404
I GUESS.

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.472
MR VILLA SPATA --

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.073
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.541
WHAT WE DO LEGISLATURE'S WE HAVE

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:21.911
A HODGE PODGE OF LEGISLATION YOU

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.913
MENTIONED CAUGHT MY ATTENTION DO

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.481
WE DON'T HAVE HARMONIZATION?

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.949
OF THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE I

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:29.419
THINK THAT.

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.953
THIS OUTCRY OR SOMEBODY GETS

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.923
ELECTED TO THE CENTER OF THE

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.557
ASSEMBLY AND THEY WANT TO REFORM

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:34.991
SAKE.

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.392
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.360
BUT THEY JUST WANT TO REFORM

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.362
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.365
GET DONE AND CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:43.800
SOME EXAMPLES MAYBE YOUR HONOR.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.601
THAT SO IT HELPS US BECAUSE

01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:48.037
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF OF

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.239
DEALING WITH THIS THE ILLUSION

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.474
OF BILLS ARE GONNA BE INTRODUCE.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.242
HAD TO DO AND GIVE US SOME IDEAS

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.078
OF WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:58.781
THIS LACK OF HARMONY --

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.650
FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:01.417
TELL TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:02.151
TEARING TEARING IS THIS AT THE

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:03.820
IDEA THAT ONCE YOU'VE DONE AN

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.121
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR A

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.123
PROJECT THEN LATER ACTIVITIES

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.925
UNDER THAT SAME PROJECT CAN USE

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.426
THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.061
THEIR SEEK ONE ELSE.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.463
UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING NEW

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.998
RELATED TO THAT LATER ACTIVITY --

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:17.133
ORDERS --

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.901
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE IMPACT

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:21.003
RELATING TO THAT NEW ACTIVITY SO

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.238
RATHER THAN REINVENTING THE

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.473
WHEEL DO YOU USE THE SAME

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:24.941
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCKED AND JUST

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:29.011
FOCUS IN ON ON WHAT'S NEW.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.179
THE LATEST SET OF SECRET

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:33.316
STREAMLINING HIS LOOK AT THAT IN

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.617
TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:36.018
IN SOME CASES --

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.354
YOU LOOK AT NOT WHAT'S NEW BUT

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.423
WHAT IS QUOTE UNQUOTE PECULIAR

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.858
TO THE PROJECT.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.359
SO RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.128
NEW AND MORE SEVERE IMPACTS OF

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.996
WILL IS THE IMPACT PECULIAR TO

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.197
THE PROJECT --

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.699
AND ARE THERE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.868
STANDARDS THAT WOULD HELP AVOID

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.002
THAT IMPACT --

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.971
THERE BY BRINGING IT DOWN TO A

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.339
LEVEL I GUESS OF LESS THAN

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:58.841
PECULIAR WHATEVER THAT WOULD BE --

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:01.277
SO THERE'S DIFFERENCES IN NORMAN

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.479
FRANCES IN WHERE THEY APPLY.

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:05.148
OTHERS ALSO DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:06.816
TYPES OF STANDARDS THAT MAY BE

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.451
APPLICABLE TO A PROJECT AS I

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.920
MENTIONED THAT SB.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.321
TWO TWENTY SIX LEGISLATION HAS A

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.956
NUMBER OF STATE STANDARDS IN

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.291
YOUR PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO MEET

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.893
I WE'RE AS NO OTHER FORM OF

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.895
TEARING HAS ANY ANY STATE

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:19.695
STANDARDS AT ALL.

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.831
SO IT VARIES A LOT AND IF IT

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.733
WERE IF WE HAD SOMETHING THAT

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:25.001
WOULD APPLY --

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.537
IN A MORE GENERALIZED MANNERS

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:28.104
SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:28.704
SIMPLE.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.640
MAYBE SOMETHING BUILDING ON WHAT

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.041
WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.543
MY GUESS IS THAT THAT WOULD COME

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.344
INTO GREATER USE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:39.415
THAT IS THE CHANGE MADE BY SB

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.716
SEVEN FORTY THREE TO THE USE OF

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.351
SPECIFIC PLANNING AYE OURS.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.888
UNDER UP PRIOR LAW AND EXISTING

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:46.889
LAW I ONCE YOU'VE DONE ANY AYE

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.124
ARE FOR SPECIFIC PLAN AND

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:50.159
RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS BETTER

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.527
CONSIST OF THE SPECIFIC PLAN

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.995
DON'T NEED ADDITIONALLY I ARE

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.230
UNLESS THERE'S A NEW IMPACT A

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.531
MORE SEVERE IMPACT.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.833
SB SEVEN FORTY THREE EXPANDED

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.568
THAT.

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.203
ALL TO ALSO INCLUDE --

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.971
CERTAIN SORTS OF MIXED USE

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:06.642
PROJECTS AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:09.512
OF JOB PRODUCING PROJECTS --

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:10.146
AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:10.913
AS LONG AS THEY WERE LOCATED

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.882
WITHIN A TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.817
SO WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR PART

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.052
OF THE STATE IT EXPANDED THAT.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.787
THE BEAUTY OF IT IS IS THAT

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:19.922
THERE IS CASE LAW ON HOW

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:21.524
SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE TO USE

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:23.092
THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AT

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.327
THE LOCAL LEVEL ONE HOUSE

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.728
SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE AS YOU

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:26.696
USE.

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:31.267
AND SO BY SIMPLY ADDING THIS

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.501
WHICH IS EASILY DEFINED.

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.303
YOU'VE NOW EXPANDED THE USE OF

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.872
IT TO ALSO COVER A MIXED USE

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.809
DEVELOPMENT AS AN INFILL PROJECT --

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.344
YOU KNOW JOB PRODUCERS AS AN

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.312
INFILL PROJECT.

01:04:43.379 --> 01:04:45.548
RELATIVELY SIMPLY.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:46.582
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT USE I I

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:47.883
HAVEN'T PERSONALLY SEEN THAT USE

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.318
BUT I I'M EXPECTING THAT TO BE

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.853
USED.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.288
PRETTY SIMPLE THE COURTS OF

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:54.757
APPEAL TEND TO PUBLISH OPINIONS

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:55.424
ON SEAQUEST.

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:56.926
THE WITH GREATER FREQUENCY THAN

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.394
PERHAPS OTHER SUBJECTS FOR THE

01:04:58.461 --> 01:04:59.729
SOLE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.464
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE LAW

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.798
AND THE COURTS GIVE GUIDANCE.

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.834
RIGHT AWAY ON ANY NEW PROVISIONS

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.502
SO -- LEASE

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:08.237
MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN --

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:10.539
THAT WE PUBLISH A LOT MORE

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.375
BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYONE WE DO IS

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.076
A NEW ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:14.777
ASSN THIS.

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.979
HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:17.513
ONE OF THINGS I FAILED TO

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.115
MENTION AND I WAS WHEN WE TALKED

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.283
ABOUT STREAMLINING IS THAT.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.618
SENATE JACKSON DID HAVE A A BILL

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.854
THAT REQUIRED THE REQUIRES THE

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.422
PREPARATION OF THE RECORD

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:31.427
SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE WITH THE

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:32.662
PROJECT BEING.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:33.429
RUN THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.297
DOESN'T APPLY TO EVERYBODY AND

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:35.831
AND IT COULD BE EXPANDED TO TWO

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:37.733
OTHER PRO PROJECTS BEYOND THE

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.868
ONES AT THE PLACE TO NOW.

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:39.902
AND I AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.370
THAT THE PREPARATION OF THE

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.605
RECORD IS ONE OF THE BIG

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:43.739
BOTTLENECKS IN.

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.474
IN THE TIMING OF SEQUEL

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.376
LITIGATION --

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.546
AND UNDER THE LAW THE AGENCY OR

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.381
THE PETITIONER CAN PREPARE THE

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.649
RECORD - I

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:54.784
THINK YOU COULD --

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.052
YOU COULD CHANGE THOSE

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.720
PROVISIONS TO MAKE RECORDS GET

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.422
DONE MORE QUICKLY --

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:02.091
IT WHEN PETITIONERS DO THE

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.359
RECORD FREQUENTLY --

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.294
YOU WE GET PUBLIC RECORDS ACT

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.463
REQUEST AT THE TRIAL COURTS IN

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.764
ORDER TO HELP THE PETITIONER

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:09.999
DEVELOP THE RECORD.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.268
AND IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.969
JUDGE THAT WHY SHOULD WE BE

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.271
DEALING WITH.

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.939
SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND ALSO PUBLIC

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.774
RECORDS ACT REQUEST I MEAN I

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:19.842
THINK THERE ARE EASIER WAYS OF

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:20.443
DOING IT.

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:22.778
SO THOSE THERE ARE SOME THINGS

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:24.313
THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK I AM.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.381
THIS SENATE JACKSON DIDN'T WANT

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.483
US TO SAY HOW TO FIX THINGS BUT

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.485
AND A COUPLE THINGS THAT FROM A

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.353
JUDICIAL STANDPOINT.

01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:32.722
THAT COULD BE FIXED AND AND THE

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:33.923
ONE THAT HAS THE SIMULTANEOUS

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.424
RECORD DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.625
IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.894
SB NINE HUNDRED APPLIES WHEN THE

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.197
RECORDS AVAILABLE.

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:44.967
AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE ACTUAL

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:48.738
LAWSUITS OVER AND SO --

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.339
UNFORTUNATELY YOU GET SOME

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:52.274
ANCILLARY ISSUES THAT DON'T

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:53.309
ACTUALLY DEAL WITH WHETHER

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.345
SEQUEL IS BEING VIOLATED OR NOT.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.013
WELL JUST A STROKE I'M NOT GONNA

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.249
COR WITH YOUR CORRECTING THE

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.617
MISTAKES OR PERHAPS THE

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:04.987
LIMITATIONS OF MY LEGISLATION.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.288
FOR DO YOU BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.556
BILL BUT I MEAN AND I THINK THAT

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:08.858
THE TIME THERE WAS A FEELING

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.326
THAT SOME AGENCIES DIDN'T HAVE

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:13.462
THE CAPABILITY RIGHT --

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:16.132
YOU KNOW THE TO ELECTRONICALLY

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.366
DO ALL THIS BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.467
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE GETTING

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.869
MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AS

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.404
TIME GOES BY I MEAN.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.406
WE EVEN AT OUR COURTLY FILE

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:24.473
ELECTRONICALLY NOW.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.841
IF IT IS DOES ACTUALLY REDUCE

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:27.510
THE TIME FRAME IF IT'S

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.412
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY PREPARED UP TO

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.714
A YEAR OR SO IT REDUCES SAVE A

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.182
LOT OF TIME YEAH.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.116
WHICH WAS HAVE LAST QUESTION I

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:35.518
GUESS THE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.653
BECAUSE OF EVERYBODY WANTS TO

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.921
FOCUS ON STREAMLINING.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:41.257
SEQUEL BUT WE HAVE THE BASE THE

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.525
THE UNDERLYING A LOT THE

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:46.228
CALIFORNIA RESOURCESACT A. B. --

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.997
THE AIR CLEAN AIR ACT HAS THERE

YOUR ATTENTION THAT SAYS THERE'S

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.001
SOME CONFUSION.

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:53.869
AT THE APPLICATION OF THE

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.638
UNDERLYING LAW WHEN YOU HAVE

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.207
THIS PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS THAT

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:58.808
WE MAY NOT.

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:02.678
WE HAVE THIS.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:06.582
THANKS THAT IS.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:07.783
SENATOR THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

FREQUENTLY ARM ARE MULTIPLE

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:10.152
LAWSUITS FILED ON A SINGLE

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.455
PROJECT. ONE GROUP MAY FILE

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:13.556
SEQUEL LOSSES ON A ALSO FOLLOW

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:14.890
SOMEONE ELSE LAWSUIT.

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.192
AND WHAT THEY'RE WE ALWAYS

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:17.927
CONSOLIDATE THEM AT THE COURTS

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.528
OF APPEAL AND ACTUALLY AT THE

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.063
TRIAL COURT'S THE CHIEF JUSTICE.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.132
OF CAN PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:28.037
PUT A BEFORE ONE JUDGE AND

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.605
THAT'S A STANDARD PROCEDURE.

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:30.806
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:31.841
JUST LIKE THAT EIGHTY ONE FIFTY

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:32.741

THE SECRET CASES ALL OVER AND

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:34.910
THE OTHER ONE STILL THERE.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.512
BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE ONE JUDGE.

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:38.481
HANDLING IT AS OR ONE COURT OF

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.483
APPEAL HANDLING IT --

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:41.684
AND THAT THAT'S A TOOL THAT THE

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.953
BRANCH USES JUST TO KEEP US.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.455
SANE ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THESE

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.324
THINGS.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.259
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION --

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.461

HAVE FOR YEARS --

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.377
BUT I'VE ALSO SPENT THIRTY YEARS --

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.446
MEANT AND FIFTEEN YEARS AT A

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.313
LOOK AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.516
AT GENERAL PLANS AND AND LOOKING

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.683
AT PROJECTS SO.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.553
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.321
THINGS MAY HAVE SHIFTED.

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:21.123
OVER THOSE THIRTY YEARS --

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:23.559
BUT THE VIGNETTES ARE STILL

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:26.896

MISTER AT RIVETS PLOT THAT.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.671
YOUR FIRST FINDING ON I AM IN

YOUR SECRET DOCUMENT IS THAT THE

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.510
THAT THE THAT YOU'RE LED TO

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.312
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT A

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.080
DISCERNIBLE PATTERN.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:47.349
IN TERMS OF SYKORA THE WAY SICK

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.318
WHAT IS --

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.653
THE ANECDOTES ABOUT SEQUOIA

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.954
CAUSING PROJECT WITHDRAWALS ARE

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.389
POTENTIALLY ACCURATE FOR

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.157
SINGULAR HIGH PART HIGH PROFILE

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.358
PROJECT DO NOT REPRESENT AN

01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.826
OVERALL DISCERNIBLE PENNER.

01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:00.129
AND I'M I'M WONDERING --

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.664
WITH THAT KIND OF A STATEMENT --

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:02.464
ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED IN

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:06.402
STATISTICS IS THAT IT DEPENDS ON

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.704
WHAT YOU STUDY AND IN ORDER TO

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:11.073
MAKE IT MAKE YOUR STATEMENTS --

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.074
IN THIS.

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.009
THE CITY OF SALINAS IS TWENTY

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:16.478
MILES FROM MONTEREY PENINSULA SO

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:17.646
WERE CONSIDERED A COASTAL

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:19.582
COMMUNITY DESPITE THAT THE FACT

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:20.749
THAT OUR ECONOMICS.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.686
ARE RURAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:28.023
AND I I IN IN THE YEAR.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.559
WE APPROVED CLOSE TO TWO

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:31.126
THOUSAND FOUR DOUBLE HOUSING

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:34.396
UNITS AND THEY WERE.

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.266
HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL --

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.234
AND THEY WERE THE NASTIEST

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.936
MEETINGS THAT WE EVER HELD WAS

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:41.904
AROUND.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.373
THE FEAR THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.241
THEIR OWN VALUES ARE GOING TO BE --

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:49.111
AFFECTED BY THEY WERE LOW INCOME

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.646
AND POOR FARM WORKER HOUSING

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:51.747
PROJECTS.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:55.818
AND BOND THAT THE SEQUEL A

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.720
THREATS.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:58.821
SOME OF WHICH RESULTED IN

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.723
LITIGATION AND SOME WHICH JUST

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:02.758
RESULTED IN THREATS THAT --

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.093
FORCED.

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.661
DEVELOPERS TO DECIDE WHERE

01:11:05.728 --> 01:11:06.295
THEY'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD OR

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:07.596
NOT -- WERE

01:11:07.663 --> 01:11:10.232
REAL IN MY COMMUNITY AND SO THAT

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.734
THEY THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.901
FOR ME AND BELIEVING THAT

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:15.137
THERE'S IT HAS SUCH A LOW IMPACT

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.572
IS IT WHEN I LOOK AT THE CITIES

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.107
THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN SOME

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.642
OF THE OTHER REPORTS.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:20.709
THEY'RE THE BIG CITIES THEY'RE

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.944
NOT RURAL AGRICULTURAL

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:24.813
COMMUNITIES NUMBER ONE NUMBER

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.150
TWO OUR PROXIMITY. TO A VERY

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.551
HIGH COST.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.420
VERY ALIKE WHERE THERE'S A LACK

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.722
OF DIVERSITY AND WHERE THE

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:35.557
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GETS DUMPED

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:36.959
ON POOR --

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:40.095
LATINO MAJORITY COMMUNITIES THAT

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.563
SETS UP.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.831
A SITUATION WHERE.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.366
PEOPLE CAN COME AND TRY TO TELL

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.501
US WHAT TO DO IN OUR OWN

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.670
COMMUNITY AND USED THE

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.405
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT --

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.940
OF OF OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.942
WHICH IS TO HOUSE THE WORK FORCE.

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.444
AGAINST US AND SO LIKE I SAID I

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.179
WE WE MITIGATED ALL THE SECRET

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.281
ISSUES BUT OVER AND OVER AND

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:01.050
OVER AGAIN HAD TO FACE AND AND

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:02.317
MORE RECENTLY.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.352
THERE WAS A PROJECT THAT WAS

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.254
DEVELOPED ON A FORMALLY

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.623
INDUSTRIAL --

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:08.924
UNTOUCHED REAL SIDE WAS THE

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.492
SPRECKELS --

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:13.929
SUGAR FACTORY AND THE PROJECT BY --

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:17.299
AN AG COMPANY AND THEY TOOK NOTE

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:19.501
THE USE NO.

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.637
PUBLIC FUNDS ALL THEIR OWN MONEY

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.839
AND THEY WERE SUED UNDER SYKORA.

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.574
YEAH IN MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERIOR

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.743
COURT AND ULTIMATELY THEY BUILT

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.712
THE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.547
DIDN'T HAVE TO TO WAIT.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:34.550
AND THIS THE SUIT WAS --

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:37.286
WEST WEST WAS SETTLED FINALLY

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:38.153
FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.756
BECAUSE THEY HAD MOVED FORWARD

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.024
AND THEY BUILT IT AND IT HAD A

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.859
NEW FRANKLY HAD NO IMPACT IF YOU

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.728
CAN'T EVEN SEE IT FROM ANY ROADS

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.196
BECAUSE OF WHERE IT'S LOCATED SO.

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.832
MY CONCERN IS THAT IN MY REGION

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.601
IN IN IN THAT IN THAT SALINAS

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:53.936
VALLEY --

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.938
SEQUOIA HAS BEEN USED REPEATEDLY

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:58.140
AS A WAY FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.976
TO COME IN AND TO SO SO ONE IS.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.412
IT HAS HAD AN IMPACT IN MINUTES

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.180
COUGH IT'S COST US A LOT IN

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.148
TERMS OF FORD WILL HOUSING

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.951
PROJECTS IN TO THE FACT THAT THE

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:11.120
THE PEOPLE WHO CAN SUE THAT HAVE

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:11.386
STANDING.

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:13.889
IS SO BROAD THAT THEY DON'T EVEN

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.457
HAVE TO BE FROM OUR COMMUNITY.

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:19.995
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AND I'M

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.730
I'M WONDERING --

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.398
ESTES ROBBIE IF IF IF IF THAT'S

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:23.999
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:24.500
SEEN IN TERMS OF EITHER

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.869
COMPETITORS OR PEOPLE FROM OTHER

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:29.271
COMMUNITIES OR OR WHO JUST HAVE

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.340
A POLICY WHO HAVE A THE ATTITUDE

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:32.841
THAT THEY'D CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.343
REALLY GROW ANYMORE.

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.245
WELL I YOU KNOW CENTER I DIE

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:37.980
THERE ARE LIMITS TO STANDING I

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.581
DON'T THINK YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:42.584
BE A A YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU

01:13:42.651 --> 01:13:45.554
HAVE AN INTEREST ADVERSELY

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:46.288
AFFECTED BY IT.

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.122
ANOTHER WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.925
GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T THINK --

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.760
I I THINK THAT WE WOULD REJECT

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.228
STANDING ON SOMEBODY FROM

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:54.763
ANOTHER TOWN ALTHOUGH I MIGHT

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.032
ADD THAT UNDER THE LAW NOW A

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.333
TOWN CHANCE TO A NEIGHBORING

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.668
TOWN SO --

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.537
WE DO SOMETIMES GET LITIGATION

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.071
BETWEEN COMPETING COMMUNITIES

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:06.942
BUT I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.610
MOST RULINGS ON STANDING WOOD.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.079
WELL IT'S BEEN MORE BROAD THAN

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:14.416
THE FEDERAL --

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.584
IT'S NOT THAT BROAD I MEAN I YOU

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:16.351
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LOCAL

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.086
PERSON WHO LIVE NEARBY.

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.588
OR REGULARLY USE THE ROADS OR

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:22.124
ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED THEMSELVES

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.292
TO THE PROJECT SO THEY CAN

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:27.296
ASSERT AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.464
ADVERSE TO THEMSELVES.

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:30.098
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR IF

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.800
YOU AND I THINK THE STANDING

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.202
QUESTIONS ONE THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:34.269
CLARIFY.

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.071
I ONE QUESTION JUST BY WAY OF

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.806
CLARIFICATION THEN WE'RE GONNA

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.107
MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:41.810
YOU WOULD EARLIER TALKED I THINK --

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:44.613
MYSTERY THE SPLATTER ABOUT --

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.015
OTHER THERE ARE OTHER REASONS

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.517
THAT PEOPLE WALK AWAY FROM OR

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:49.918
DEVELOPERS WALK AWAY FROM

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:54.089
PROJECTS AND THAT TOO BECAUSE A

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.691
SMALL.

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.391
FRAGMENT OF THAT --

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.092
I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED A

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.828
DEVELOPER RELATED REASONS AND

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.797
NON SEQUEL OPPOSITION I THINK

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.599
YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT FUNDING

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.133
ISSUES -- I

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.468
THINK YOU ALSO MENTION HIGH

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:08.003
DEVELOPER FEES.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.072
AND THE LACK OF AVAILABLE SITES

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:14.409
WOULD YOU ARE JUST CLARIFY --

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:17.846
ARTICULATE FOR US THESE PROBLEMS

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:20.649
AS GREATER PROBLEMS IN THE

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:22.317
CURRENT DEVELOPMENT --

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.820
WORLD THEN THE SORT OF THE

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:26.889
STANDARD SEQUEL WHIPPING BOY.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:29.191
APPROACH OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.693
THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL OF EQUAL

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.295
CONCERN.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:33.929
YEAH IT REALLY VARIES BY

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.931
JURISDICTION AND I DON'T HAVE

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.566
THE BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE OF

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:38.367
ELEMENT DOING THIS FORTY YEARS

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.735
OR SO -- SO

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:40.702
I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE BREADTH

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.371
OF EXPERIENCE TO KNOW BUT IT IT

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.473
VARIES A LOT BY JURISDICTION AND

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.474
AND PART OF IT IS --

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.743
AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:48.810
COMING OUT OF THAT --

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.344
YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE THE

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:50.579
IMPRESSION OR THERE MAY BE A

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.014
PAST HISTORY IN THAT COMMUNITY

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.316
OF LAWSUITS WHICH TEND TO DISK.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:54.850
PEOPLE --

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.251
BUT THERE MAY ALSO BE HIGH

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.619
IMPACT FEES --

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:00.923
HIGHLAND COSTS TO BEGIN WITH --

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:03.158
COST OF CONNECTING IN A YOUR

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:04.693
PARTICULAR PROJECT WHATEVER

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.328
UTILITIES ARE ECESSARY YOUR

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.130
PROJECT MAYBE SOME DISTANCE FROM

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.998
EXISTING UTILITIES AT A HIGH

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.199
EOUGH DENSITY THAT REQUIRES

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.567
SEWER LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:15.837
THAT. TO THE FULL VARIETY OF

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:19.041
OTHER COSTS THE ONE WHO WANTED

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.542
TO BUILD ON A GREEN FIELD SITE

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.510
THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT WITHIN THE

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.378
CITY AND NOW YOU HAVE TO ANNEX

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:24.579
IT TO THE CITY.

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.781
YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.649
OF THINGS THAT POP UP --

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:30.118
AS WELL AS SEEK WITH A CAN.

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:31.086
NOT NECESSARILY SAND AWAY BUT

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:33.355
THE PART OF THE PROCESS OF GOING

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.023
TO AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.224
PERMITS THAT YOU NEED FROM THE

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.626
YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES

01:16:37.693 --> 01:16:38.827
AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:39.728
PERMITS AND ALL THAT SORT OF

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:40.162
THING.

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.563
IN THOSE VERY BY VARIOUS

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:43.365
COMMUNITY HISTORY BY CREATE

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.833

ISSUES THAT WERE WITH THE REST

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:06.722
ABOUT THE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.090

ON ANY TALK ABOUT HOW IT AND

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.593
COULD FIND ITS WAY.

GREAT WELL WE'LL START WITH YOU

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:37.446
AB [inaudible]

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.146
YEAH.

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:38.780
THANK YOU OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.348
TO SHARE RESEARCH WITH YOU MY

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.350
NAME IS MORE O'NEILL AND AS YOU

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.019
NOTED MY TITLE I MET BERKELEY

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:45.053
LAW CENTER FOR LAW AND RG

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.755
ENVIRONMENT AT AND AT THE

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:48.490
INSTITUTE. FOR URBAN AND

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.125
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.693
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GONNA

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.495
DO IS DISCUSS FIRST THE AIM OF

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.230
OUR STUDY SO RECOGNIZING THE

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:57.132
PERSISTENCE AND THE SIGNIFICANCE

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.601
OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.902
COMBINED WITH THE CHALLENGES

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.671
THAT WE FACE RELATED TO CLIMATE

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.706
CHANGE THE GOAL OF OUR WORK HAS

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:06.441
BEEN TO STUDY WHETHER STATE OR

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:09.244
LOCAL LAW MY CONSTRAINED DENTS

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:11.546
IN FILL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.415
AND IF SO WHICH LAWS AND

01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:16.118
REGULATIONS MIGHT BE AT ISSUE.

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.619
SO WE ENTERED INTO THIS WORK

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.721
RECOGNIZING THAT OTHERS HAD

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.923
FOUND INDIRECT EVIDENCE THAT

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.391
LAND USE LAW GENERALLY.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:25.460
MIGHT BE IN CONTRIBUTING TO OUR

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:26.528
HOUSING CRISIS THROUGH THE

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.196
IMPOSITION OF DELAYS INTELLECT

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:30.565
DEVELOPMENT BUT WE ALSO SAW THAT

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.134
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EMPIRICAL

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.368
RESEARCH.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.170
THAT COULD IDENTIFY WHICH LAWS

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:38.039
SPECIFICALLY WERE IT ISSUE SO

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:39.708
JULIA WILL BEGIN WITH DISCUSSING

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.276
OUR METHODS I WILL THEN TURN TO

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:45.113
SOME KEY FINDINGS AND AIRPORT

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.948
DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:47.716
GREAT I'M SO I WANT TO START BY

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.050
EXPLAINING HOW WE GATHERED OUR

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.752
DATA AND OUR RESEARCH METHODS

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.721
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT.

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:54.156
THESE METHODS REALLY ILLUSTRATE

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:55.590
THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THIS

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.159
ISSUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.193
SO FIRST I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.962
OUR OVERALL RESEARCH CLUED BY

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.864
SHARING SOME OF THE EXISTING

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:04.032
DATA LIMITATIONS.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.467
SO AS A STARTING POINT THIS WORK

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:06.968
INVOLVED COLLECTING DIFFERENT

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.203
KINDS OF DATA AND FOUR FOUR

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:10.005
PHASES.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.506
OUR FIRST PHASE INVOLVES

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.141
SELECTING OUR CITIES FOR STUDY

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.442
AND THEN SUMMARIZING ALL OF THE

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:16.011
LAW APPLICABLE TO RESIDENTIAL

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:17.646
DEVELOPMENT.

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:18.280
AND THAT'S BOTH LOCAL AND STATE

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.214
LAW.

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.482
THIS INCLUDED LAWS APPLICABLE TO

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.717
LAND USE ZONING AND LAND

01:20:22.784 --> 01:20:24.186
DEVELOPMENT MORE GENERALLY.

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.754
UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL LAND USE

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.155
PROCESS AND HOW AND WHEN SEEK

01:20:27.222 --> 01:20:29.057
WELL PLIES IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:31.493
STEP. TO BEGIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.594
CAN APPROVE RESIDENTIAL

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.796
DEVELOPMENT AND ONE OF TWO WAYS

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:35.931
THEY CAN ALLOW SOME TYPES OF

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.465
DEVELOPMENT TO PROCEED AS OF

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:38.166
RIGHT.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.035
OR APPLY A DISCRETIONARY REVIEW

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.469
PROCESS TO OTHER TYPES OF

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.071
DEVELOPMENT.

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.073
IN THE AS OF RIGHT CONTEXT IF

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.241
THE PROPOSED PROJECT MEETS ALL

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:47.776
THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.311
LOCAL ZONING CODE AND THESE ARE

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:50.712
REQUIREMENTS LIKE HEIGHT PARKING

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:51.813
AND DENSITY.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.249
THE DEVELOPER IT DIRECTLY

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:55.450
APPLIES TO GET A BUILDING PERMIT.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.018
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS FOR

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.320
INSTANCE IS ITS OWN THAT ALLOWS

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.021
A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH THE

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.223
ONE STORY MAXIMUM.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.657
AND A TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.492
LOT MINIMUM AS LONG AS THE HOUSE

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:05.527
FALLS WITHIN THIS BUILDING

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:07.529
ENVELOPE IT'S AS OF RIGHT AND

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:08.863
CAN PROCEED DIRECTLY TO A

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.498
BUILDING PERMIT.

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.133
ON THE OTHER HAND CITIES CAN

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.068
REQUIRE THAT PROPOSED

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:14.669
DEVELOPMENT BE SUBJECT

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:16.004
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.239
THEIR IMAGINATIVE OLIVER OWNS

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.473
LAND THAT IS OWNED FOR SINGLE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.308
FAMILY HOMES BUT WANTS TO BUILD

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:21.643
AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:22.711
THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO GET THE

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.312
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO REZONE THE

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.081
PROPERTY AND THAT REQUIRES A

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.549
FULL DEBATE --

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:28.717
AND DECISION MAKING PROCESS BY

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:30.518
THE CITY COUNCIL.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.354
BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.557
A CITIES BASED ON IN THE AREA

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.858
BUT THE CODE MAY STILL REQUIRE

01:21:36.925 --> 01:21:38.326
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.961
FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT --

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:40.495
MEETS CERTAIN PRESCRIBED

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.564
STANDARDS THIS IS OFTEN CALLED A

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.032
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT OR C. U.

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.467
P..

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.269
FINALLY AND THIS IS THE MOST

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:48.803
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FOR STUDY

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.238
EVEN WHERE PROJECTS MIGHT

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:51.640
OTHERWISE FIT THE BASE ZONING

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.541
SAY THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.210
THE SINGLE FAMILIES OWN EXAMPLE.

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.978
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT STILL

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:58.480
REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:00.015
THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF THIS

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.549
OUR DESIGNER ARCHITECTURAL

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:02.884
REVIEW WHERE THE PROJECT MUST

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.552
MEET CERTAIN AESTHETIC STANDARDS

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.187
EVEN THOUGH IT COMPLIES WITH THE

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:08.189
UNDERLYING ZONING CODE.

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.291
UNDERSTANDING HOW SEQUEL

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.558
OPERATES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.893
ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS PHASE OF

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.662
RESEARCH AND WE JUST GOT A

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:14.729
REALLY EXCELLENT --

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.464
INTRODUCTION TO SEAQUEST SO I

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:17.065
WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS VERY

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.867
QUICKLY BUT JUST TO REITERATE A

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:20.935
FEW KEY POINTS --

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:21.903
YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:22.637
SEE WHERE THEY USUALLY

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:23.938
ENVISIONED LARGE DETAILED

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:25.373
REPORTS ABOUT ALL SORTS OF

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.941
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:28.576
ACCOMPANIED BY PUBLIC HEARINGS

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:30.178
AND THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW IS AN

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.047
NINE BUYER MENTAL IMPACT REPORT

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:32.881
OR ANY AYE ARE.

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.249
BUT SEE WHAT PERMITS OTHER FORMS

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.917
OF COMPLIANCE INCLUDING

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:36.951
STREAMLINING --

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.453
WHICH ALLOWS THE DEVELOPER TO

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.088
PROPOSE A PROJECT THAT TEARS OFF

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.923
AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.325
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED.

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:46.394
SOMETIMES A DEVELOPER MAY ALSO --

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:47.762
PROPOSING AGREED TO MITIGATE YOU

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.030
KNOW POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.465
IMPACTS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED

01:22:50.532 --> 01:22:52.100
MITIGATING NEGATIVE DECLARATION

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:53.268
OR IN MND.

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:55.503
AND SOME PROJECTS MAY BE EXEMPT

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:56.738
FROM ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:59.374
THESE CATEGORICALLY EXAM

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:02.510
PROJECTS UNDERSTANDING HOW BOTH

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:04.245
LOCAL LAW AND SEQUEL INTERACT

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.780
MATTERS BECAUSE OF OPPOSED

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:08.483
pNOT APPLY.

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:09.951
HOWEVER IT IS LOCAL LAW THAT

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:11.486
DETERMINES WHICH PROJECTS ARE AS

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:12.620
OF RIGHT AND WHICH ONES ARE

01:23:12.687 --> 01:23:14.723
DISCRETIONARY AND THESE LOCAL

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.558
LAWS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:17.258
ARE PLANNING COULD HAVE

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:18.727
SUMMARIES HELP US UNDERSTAND

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:19.861
THESE DISTINCTIONS SO THAT WE

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.663
CAN CONSTRUCT OUR PROJECT

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.897
DATABASE.

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:26.000
OUR PROJECT DATABASE CONTAINS.

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.068
ALL PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL

TWENTY SIXTEEN TO CONSTRUCT THE

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:38.146
DATABASES WE COLLECTED ABOUT

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:38.580
TWENTY FIVE PROJECT

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:39.814

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.324
CA ANDY'S OF APPROVALS. FOR A

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.392
THIRD PHASE WE CONDUCTED

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.559
RESEARCH INTERVIEWS WITH

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:52.961
MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.195
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.630
CITY STAFF LIKE PLANNERS AN

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.365
ATTORNEY'S MARKET RATE AND

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.434
NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ADVOCATES

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:00.835
AND CONSULTANTS TYPICALLY

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:03.138
OUTSIDE COUNSEL ARCHITECTS ARE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.272
ENTITLEMENT EXPERTS.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:05.807
AND THEN FR A FINAL PHASE WE

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.375
EXAMINE WHETHER THE PROJECTS WE

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:08.777
STUDIED WENT THROUGH LOCAL LEVEL

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.845
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:13.615
LITIGATION AND PARTICULARLY

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:14.883
SEQUEL RELATED LITIGATION.

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:16.151
TURNING OUT BRIEFLY I'M TO SOME

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.886
IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT DATA

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.654
ACCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.723
UNSURPRISINGLY OUR ABILITY TO

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.291
ACCESS DATA TO CONSTRUCT THE

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:25.293
DATABASE VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:25.727
FROM JURISDICTION TO

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:26.995
JURISDICTION.

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.430
IN ORDER TO CREATE A PROJECT

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:30.198
DATABASE WE FIRST OBTAIN A LIST

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:31.766
OF ENTITLED DEVELOPMENTS THAT

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.168
MEET OUR CRITERIA.

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.803
AND VERY FEW CITIES HAD A LIST

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.371
OF ENTITLEMENT ABOUT ENTITLED

01:24:36.438 --> 01:24:38.373
DEVELOPMENTS READILY AVAILABLE

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.674
ON THE PLANNING WEBSITES.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:40.775
SO THAT MEANS THAT IN MOST

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.410
JURISDICTIONS WE HAD TO CALL THE

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:43.845
PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO REQUEST

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.147
THIS LAST OR SUBMIT A PUBLIC

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.816
RECORDS ACT REQUEST.

01:24:47.882 --> 01:24:48.917
AND I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:50.485
THAT DURING THESE YEARS STATE

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.886
MANDATED REPORTING THROUGH THE

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.288
HOUSING ELEMENT DID NOT REALLY

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:54.389
HELP US TO UNDERSTAND

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:55.924
ENTITLEMENT PROCESSES AT THE

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.091
LOCAL LEVEL.

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.193
DURING OUR STUDY YEARS THE

01:24:58.259 --> 01:24:59.894
HOUSING ELEMENT ANNUAL PROGRESS

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.996
REPORTS TRACK PERMITTED PROJECTS

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.465
ON A YEARLY BASIS BUT THEY DO

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.833
NOT CONTAIN DATA ON THE

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.968
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS SEES THAT

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:09.270
PRECEDE THESE BUILDING PERMITS.

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.238
AND THEN AFTER OBTAINING THE

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:11.973
PROJECT LIST WE GATHER DATA ON

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.241
THE MOVE ON THE PROJECT

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:14.676
CHARACTERISTICS.

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:15.376
AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:18.246
PROJECT LAW THAT'S THE LOCAL

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.481
CITY LEVEL VERY MOST

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.082
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.951
A MINORITY OF LARGE CITIES HAVE

01:25:23.017 --> 01:25:24.519
LINKS THEY'RE ENTITLEMENT DATA

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:25.954
TO ZONING AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIC

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.455
INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:28.923
THIS LINKAGE MAKES IT POSSIBLE

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.758
TO COLLECT ALL PROJECT

01:25:30.825 --> 01:25:32.260
CHARACTERISTICS AT ONE TIME.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.761
MOST JURISDICTIONS HAVE SOME

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.129
SORT OF PERMITTING INTERFACE

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:37.499
AVAILABLE WHICH AT THE MINIMUM

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.633
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SEARCH BY

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.835
APPLICATION NUMBER TO DETERMINE

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.036
ENTITLEMENT OUTCOMES.

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:43.338
BUT EVEN THE CITY IS THAT HAVE

01:25:43.404 --> 01:25:45.039
YOU KNOW PERMITTING INTERFACES

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.574
LIKE EXCEL --

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:47.909
OR OTHER CLOUD BASED SOFTWARE

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.811
MISSING OR INCOMPLETE

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.012
INFORMATION IS COMMON.

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.647
SOME JURISDICTIONS AND THIS IS

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:53.948
PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:56.050
SMALLER CITIES HAVE NO ONLINE

01:25:56.117 --> 01:25:57.085
ENTITLEMENT ARE PERMITTING

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:58.853
INTERFACE WHICH THEN REQUIRES

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.455
OUR TEAM TO SEARCH THROUGH EVERY

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:01.723
SINGLE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.091
PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:05.860
COUNCIL AGENDA TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.262
WAS ENTITLED IN THAT CITY.

01:26:07.328 --> 01:26:09.397
AND THE QUALITY OF THESE AGENDAS

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:10.832
AND MINUTES VERY CONSIDERABLY.

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.166
NOT ALL CITIES MAKE STAFF

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.434
REPORTS AVAILABLE WITH THEIR

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.969
AGENDAS ON THEIR PUBLIC WEBSITES

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.104
WHICH THEN REQUIRES US TO

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.872
CONDUCT ANOTHER LAYER OF

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:19.207
REQUESTS FOR DATA.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:20.942
AND DURING THIS PROCESS WE ALSO

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:22.644
OBSERVE MAJOR INCONSISTENCIES

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.778
BETWEEN AGENDAS AND STAFF

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.513
REPORTS AND IT'S CRITICAL

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.149
pDATA DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:29.751
RELIABILITY OF SELF REPORTED

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.486
DATA FROM THE CITIES.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.221
AND HAS IMPORTANT IMPACTS ON THE

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:35.256
APPROVAL PROCESS MORE GENERALLY.

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.758
WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.326
DESPITE THEIR HEAVY WORKLOADS.

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:39.360
ALL OF THE PLANNING DEPARTMENTS

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.628
WE ENGAGE WITH WERE VERY

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.497
RESPONSIVE AND VERY

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.965
ACCOMMODATING OF OUR REQUESTS.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.567
FROM OUR WORK IN INTERVIEWS IT

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:46.467
REALLY APPEARS THAT

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:48.303
TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:49.938
INFLUENCE HOW QUICKLY STAFF AND

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:52.140
OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS CAN ANALYZE

01:26:52.206 --> 01:26:53.708
THESE LOCAL PROCESS SEES.

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:54.842
AND THEN FINALLY TOUCHING

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:57.178
BRIEFLY ON OUR LITIGATED RICARDO

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.681
LITIGATION RELATED RESEARCH --

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.349
WE ALSO PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:03.151
ASSESSMENT OF ALL LITIGATION

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.819
AGAINST ENTITLED DEVELOPMENT

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.521
PROJECTS OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS.

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.956
TO DO THIS RESEARCH STATE

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.490
RECORDS TO IDENTIFY ALL SEEK OF

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.159
PETITIONS AND OUR BAY AREA IN

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.594
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.095
WE ALSO SEARCHED COUNTY COURT

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.597
RECORDS WHICH ENABLED US TO

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.832
IDENTIFY ALL WRITS FILED AGAINST

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.167
EACH OVER SELECTED CITIES

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:22.070
BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:22.637
TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO PROVIDE

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.472
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ABOUT RATES

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.107
OF LITIGATION FOR C. CA AND

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:27.141
NON SEQUEL CLAIMS.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.910
WE ISOLATED RECORDS ASSOCIATED

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.878
WITH LITIGATED PROJECTS OF FIVE

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:32.246
OR MORE RESIDENTIAL UNITS.

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:33.848
WE COMPLETED THIS COMPARISON FOR

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:34.816
THE BAY AREA AND WE'RE IN THE

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:37.652
PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:38.119
COLLECTION IN SOUTHERN

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.354
CALIFORNIA.

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:40.154
AND THEN FINALLY TO OBTAIN

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.489
APPEAL RATES WE SEARCHED ALL

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:43.024
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS PLANNING

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:44.692
COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:48.062
AGENDA AND MINUTES FROM.

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:48.596
TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:49.230
SEVENTEEN AND NOW WE'LL TURN TO

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.165
OUR FINDINGS TO RESEARCH HAS

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.534
UNCOVERED.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.036
SO I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.404
FINDINGS ABOUT THE ENTITLEMENT

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:57.872
PROCESS IS GENERALLY AND THEN I

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.641
WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC FINDINGS

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:01.876
RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:04.345
SYKORA WITHIN OUR STUDY CITIES.

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:06.080
OUR FIRST NOTABLE FINDING WAS

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:08.016
THAT OUR NINE STUDY CITIES

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:10.218
REQUIRED DISCRETIONARY REVIEW

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:12.286
FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE ONE

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.087
THOUSAND AND EIGHTY SEVEN

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:14.055
PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.491
DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN OUR DATA SET.

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.826
SO AFTER EXAMINING EACH CITIES

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.128
LAND YOU SYSTEM THAT WE FOUND

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:22.363
THAT ONLY LOS ANGELES.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.432
HAD AN AS OF RIGHT PROCESS THAT

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:25.933
WOULD BE APPLICABLES TO PROPOSE

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.568
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:28.803
OR MORE UNITS.

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:30.605
SPECIFICALLY LOS ANGELES HASN'T

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:31.739
AS OF RIGHT PROCESS FOR

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.108
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF UP TO

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.143
FORTY NINE UNITS.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.978
IF THE UNDERLYING ZONING PERMITS

01:28:37.045 --> 01:28:39.414
THE DENSITY ONCE WE COLLECTED

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:41.482
AND ANALYZED DATA AT THE PROJECT

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:43.651
LEVEL HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT ONLY

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:44.986
ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY PROJECTS

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:47.121
OR ABOUT 25%.

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.322
OF THE PROJECTS WE ANALYZE

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:49.924
WITHIN LOS ANGELES WHERE AS OF

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:50.792
RIGHT.

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:53.628
WE ALSO FOUND THAT EIGHT OF THE

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:54.295
OTHER NINE CITIES THAT WE

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.731
STUDIED DO NOT PROVIDE FOR AS OF

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.800
RIGHT TO PROCESSES FOR PROJECTS

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.401
OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS.

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:02.003
AND IN FACT WITHIN TWO OF OUR

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.105
STUDY CITIES THERE IS NO AS OF

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.606
RIGHT PROCESS FOR ANY

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.008
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:09.510
INCLUDES SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS.

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:11.979
WE USE FIGURE THREE IN OUR HAND

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:13.448
OUT TO YOU TO ILLUSTRATE THIS.

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.183
THIS FINDING IS OF PARTICULAR

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:17.552
IMPORTANCE FOR OUR WORK BECAUSE

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.220
AS PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED.

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:20.988
THE WHAT DOES NOT APPLY TO AS OF

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:23.157
RIGHT PROJECTS BUT IT DOES APPLY

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.126
TO PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.394
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:29.063
SO WHEN CITIES CHOOSE TO

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.233
REQUIRED FIGURE SEEK WHAT.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.234
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.169
FINDING MEANS IS THAT NINE OF

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:37.004
OUR NINE CITIES ARE CHOOSING TO

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:39.941
REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.576
PROCESS TO APPLY TO DO PRETTY

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.712
MUCH ALL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.047
AND THEREFORE THE CITIES ARE.

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:47.548
REQUIRING THAT THESE PROJECTS

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.050
UNDERGO ENVIRONMENTS REVIEW

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:49.784
UNDERSUPPLY.

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.519
AND THIS INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:54.722
COMPLETELY COMPLY WITH THE LOCAL

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:55.556
ZONING CODE.

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:57.391
ANOTHER IMPORTANT FINDING IS

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.626
THAT THE LOCAL PROCESSES FOR

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:00.428
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW VERY

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:02.797
TREMENDOUSLY ACROSS HOW THEY

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.298
WERE APPLIED IN OUR NINE CITIES.

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.033
EVEN WHEN THE CITIES WERE USING

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.769
THE SAME MECHANISM FOR

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:09.337
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW --

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:10.705
TABLE ONE IN OUR HAND OUT

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.440
ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE IS IN

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:14.041
THE ENTITLEMENT TIME FRAMES

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:15.510
ACROSS OUR NINE CITIES.

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:18.312
THOSE TIME FRAMES RANGE FROM

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:18.946
SEVEN TO THIRTY NINE MONTHS IN

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.348
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO

01:30:20.414 --> 01:30:21.783
MOVE THROUGH THE REQUIRED

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:22.884
ENTITLEMENT PROCESS.

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.552
WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AFTER

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.320
THE CLOSE ANALYSIS OF THESE TIME

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:27.989
FRAMES AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:29.323
IS THAT THESE PROPOSED

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:31.459
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS MOVED

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:31.726
THROUGH.

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.094
WE FEAR FOUNDED THERE DOES NOT

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.595
APPEAR TO BE ANY OBVIOUS

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:37.131
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.599
OF APPROVALS THE CITY IMPOSES.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.101
AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:42.103
FOR A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TO

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:42.670
MOVE THROUGH THE ENTITLEMENT

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:43.437
PROCESS.

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:44.772
OAKLAND IN REDWOOD CITY FOR

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.808
EXAMPLE ARE TO THE CITIES THAT

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:48.709
IMPOSE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:50.111
APPROVAL STEPS ON AVERAGE.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.846
BUT THEMEDIAN TIME LINES IN

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.447
THOSE CITIES WERE SEVEN MONTHS

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:55.650
IN CONTRAST SANTA MONICA IMPOSES

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.285
LESS STEPS TO APPROVAL BUT THE

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:59.187
MEDIAN TIMELINE TO ENTITLEMENT

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:00.388
IS THIRTY NINE MONTHS.

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:02.323
THEY'RE ALSO DOES NOT APPEAR TO

01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.393
BE A REALLY IT IMPOSES TO SECURE

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:06.961
ENTITLEMENT AND RATES OF

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:09.096
ENTITLEMENT TABLE ONE ALSO

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.665
ILLUSTRATES THIS.

01:31:10.731 --> 01:31:12.633
WHEN ALSO IDENTIFIES THE PRIMARY

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.435
MECHANISM THAT DISCRETIONARY

01:31:14.502 --> 01:31:17.104
REVIEW TAKES IN EACH CITY?

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.372
SO YOU'LL KNOW IN THAT TABLE

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:19.607
THAT FIVE OF THE CITIES THAT ARE

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.442
LISTED ARE USING DESIGNER

01:31:21.509 --> 01:31:23.311
ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW IS OUR

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.679
PRIMARY MECHANISM.

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:25.913
FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.315
AND YET [inaudible]

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:34.422
DOT.

01:31:34.488 --> 01:31:36.023
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE USING THE

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.525
SAME PROCESS. TO EACH OF THESE

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:39.160
POINTS ARE HIGHLIGHTING HOW

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.995
LOCAL CONTEXT ARE SHAPING THE

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:42.597
APPLICATION OF LAW.

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.931
OUR INTERVIEW DATA SUGGESTS THAT

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.399
OF OUR VARIETY OF NON LAW

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:46.334
FACTORS.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.035
SUCH AS CITY STAFFING OR

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:49.503
POLITICS ARE INFLUENCING HOW

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:52.306
SIMILAR LAWS ARE APPLIED WITHIN

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:54.408
VARIOUS LOCAL CONTACTS.

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:56.644
ANOTHER NOTABLE OBSERVATION IS

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:57.979
THAT ENTITLEMENT TIME LINES DO

01:31:58.045 --> 01:31:59.881
NOTALWAYS APPEAR TO BE RELATED

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:00.748
TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:02.416
PROJECT SPECIFICALLY PROJECTS

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:03.517
SIZE.

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:05.286
THE FOR EXAMPLE SMALLER PROJECTS

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.488
DEFINED AS FIVE OR TWO TWENTY

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:08.923
FIVE UNITS IN THIS CONTEXT.

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.524
MOVE FASTER THROUGH ENTITLEMENT

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.593
PROCESSES IN ONLY TWO OF OUR

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.895
NINE STUDY CITIES.

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:15.930
SO IN SIX CITIES WE ALSO SAW

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:17.465
THAT SMALLER PROJECTS TO NOTABLY

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:20.101
LONGER THAN LARGER PROJECTS.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.969
MULTIPLE INTERVIEWEES OFFERED

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:22.937
ONE EXPLANATION FOR THIS

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.239
SUGGESTING THAT LARGER PROJECTS

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:26.974
ARE SOMETIMES RESOURCE IN A WAY

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.542
THAT SOME SMALLER PROJECTS OR

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:29.644
NOT.

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.745
AND THAT THIS ALLOWS LARGER

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:32.613
PROJECTS TO BENEFIT FROM

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.814
CONSULTANT SECOND HELP.

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:35.349
DEVELOPERS NAVIGATE THE

01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:38.753
COMPLEXITY OTHER EXPLANATION MAY

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:40.087
BE RELATED TO WHERE THE PROJECTS

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:41.289
ARE CITED.

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:43.324
AS WE OBSERVE THAT SOME PROJECTS

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:44.959
INCLUDING LARGER PROJECTS.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:45.927
THAT ARE PROPOSED WITHIN

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.695
SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS IN THE

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.764
CITY'S APPEAR TO MOVE FASTER

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:50.831
THAN THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:53.034
PROPOSED OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.535
PLAN AREAS.

01:32:54.602 --> 01:32:57.305
OUR FINDINGS ARE ALSO SHOWING

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.240
WHERE HOW WHERE AND HOW PROJECTS

01:32:59.307 --> 01:33:01.275
ARE COMPLYING SEEK REQUIREMENTS

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.743
AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT.

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.278
WHEN WE ANALYZED HOW MANY

01:33:04.345 --> 01:33:05.613
PROJECTS MOVE THROUGH DIFFERENT

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.248
DISCRETE PROCESSES TO COMPLY

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.282
WITH SEEK WHAT?

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:10.017
WE FOUND THAT A LOW PERCENTAGE

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.485
OF THE PROJECTS WE STUDIED

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.120
REQUIRED FULL THE I. OURS THIS

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.488
IS NOTABLE TO US BECAUSE IN

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.357
INTERVIEWS WE FREQUENTLY

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.959
ENCOUNTERED PERCEPTIONS THAT HE

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:19.293
AYE OURS WERE COMMON.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.594
AND CERTAINLY PERCEPTIONS THAT

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:21.696
THEY WERE MORE COMMON THAN WHAT

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:24.031
WE OBSERVE IN THE PROJECT LEVEL

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:24.365
DATA.

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.300
THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:28.569
REQUIRE ER'S SUPPLIED ALSO

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.271
SURPRISED US.

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.540
SO ALTHOUGH GENERALLY ER'S WERE

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:33.874
REQUIRED FOR THE LARGEST

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.509
PROJECTS IN MOST OF OUR CITIES

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.078
WE ALSO FOUND THAT RELATIVELY

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:38.346
LARGE PROJECTS AND NOW WE'RE

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:39.814
DEFINING THAT AS A HUNDRED UNITS

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.015
ARE MORE.

01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:42.583
COULD GO THROUGH STREAMLINED

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:43.751
SECRET PROCESSES.

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:44.919
SO WE OBSERVE THAT IN SOME

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:47.555
CITIES A LARGE PROJECT OF OVER A

01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:48.222
HUNDRED UNITS COULD BENEFIT FROM

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:49.023
TEARING.

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:51.058
WHILE A SMALLER PROJECT OF LESS

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:53.527
THAN TWENTY FIVE UNITS MIGHT

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:54.362
HAVE ANY AYE ARE.

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.563
AND WHEN WE REFER TO STREAMLINE

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.331
HERE OF COURSE REFERRING TO

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:58.866
TEARING OFF OF AN E. I. ARE

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.701
ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN

01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:02.003
OR GENERAL PLAN.

01:34:02.069 --> 01:34:03.871
AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.573
CHARACTERISTICS INDICATED THAT.

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.241
WHETHER A PROPOSED PROJECT WAS

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:08.676
PROPOSED WITHIN A SPECIFIC PLAN

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:11.145
AREA RATHER THAN THE PROJECT

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.315
CHARACTERISTICS.

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:15.449
ACTUALLY DETERMINE THIS OUTCOME.

01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:16.717
SO WE CAN SEE IN THIS KIND OF

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.285
CONTEXT HOW IMPORTANT.

01:34:18.352 --> 01:34:20.287
IT IS.

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:22.957
THAT PLANNING ACTIVITIES HELP

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:24.258
FACILITATE STREAMLINING.

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:25.659
WE ALSO FOUND THAT IN GENERAL

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:26.994
THE USE OF STREAMLINING APPEARS

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.562
ASSOCIATED WITH QUICKER TIME

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:30.898
LINES OVERALL AND LOWER RATES OF

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.266
LITIGATION.

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:33.868
SO CROSS ALL NINE CITIES ON

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.770
AVERAGE TEARING TAKES SIXTEEN

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:37.972
MONTHS THE IRS TAKE FORTY FOUR

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:38.739
MONTHS.

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:39.673
BUT OCCASION RATES ARE PROJECTS

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.175
THAT USED HEARING WERE AS LOW AS

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:42.276
2%.

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.644
EDUCATION RATES OF PROJECTS THAT

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:46.280
USE ER'S WERE 19%.

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:47.715
THE COLLECTIVELY AGAIN THIS

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:52.053
SHOWS SELECT IT STREAMLINING FOR

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:53.587
MORE DENSE INFILL DEVELOPMENT.

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:54.555
WITH RESPECT TO SEE WILL

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.123
LITIGATION OVERALL WHEN WE

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:57.992
ANALYSE OUR SET OF PROJECTS TO

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:59.260
SEE HOW MANY FACE SEQUEL

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:00.861
LITIGATION WE FOUND THAT

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:03.431
APPROXIMATELY 3% OF ALL OF THE

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.799
PROJECTS THAT WE STUDIED.

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:06.100
FACE LITIGATION THAT INCLUDED

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.369
STEEPER RELATED CLAIMS THE TABLE

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:09.503
THREE IN THE HANDOUT PROVIDES

01:35:09.570 --> 01:35:12.073
DETAILS ABOUT LITIGATION RATES

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:12.740
WITHIN EACH OF OUR SPECIFIC

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:13.707
CITIES.

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.209
AND INTERESTINGLY ALTHOUGH SOME

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.510
CITIES AT VERY LOW SEQUEL

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:18.546
LITIGATION RATES WE OFTEN HEARD

01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:20.481
STATEMENTS IN INTERVIEWS WITH IN

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:21.715
ALL CITIES THAT REVEAL

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:22.817
PERCEPTIONS THAT SEQUEL

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.052
LITIGATION WAS MUCH HIGHER AND

01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:26.620
THAT LITIGATION SHAPE LOCAL

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.789
PRACTICES. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:31.058
HOW MUCH OPPOSITION PROPOSED.

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:32.760
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FACE WE

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.261
ALSO EXPLORED RATES OF

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:35.830
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND WHICH

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.064
OPPONENTS CAN CHALLENGE LOCAL

01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:38.532
DECISIONS MADE USING

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:40.901
DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROCESS WE

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:41.735
PRESENT THE RATES OF

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.270
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS ALSO IN

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:44.538
TABLE.

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:45.506
THREE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:46.974
FINDING IS THAT ACROSS ALL

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.676
CITIES RATES IN THE MINISTRY OF

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.344
APPEALS AND LITIGATION DO NOT

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:51.779
NECESSARILY SEEM TO HAVE AN

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:56.016
OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP TO

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.685
ENTITLEMENT HIGHLIGHTS GENERALLY.

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.686
AFTER ANALYZING THE LAWSUITS

01:35:58.752 --> 01:35:59.420
THAT DID ARISE IN OUR DATA WE

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:00.955
WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE WHAT IS

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:02.790
OCCURRING ACROSS ALL SEQUEL

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:04.225
COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS.

01:36:04.291 --> 01:36:05.559
SO TABLE FOR PROVIDE YOU SOME

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.027
INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL OF

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.662
THE THIRTY LAWSUITS THAT WE

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:10.064
LOOKED AT IN THE ALL NINE CITIES.

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.632
IT PROVIDES YOU THE DISTRIBUTION

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.267
OF LITIGATION ACROSTIC BUT

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:15.035
PATHWAYS FOR THESE LAWSUITS.

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:15.870
THIS TELLS US HOW MANY OF THE

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:17.338
LAWSUIT'S FELL WITHIN SPECIFIC

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:19.140
CATEGORIES OF SEQUEL COMPLIANCE

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:20.341
PATHWAYS.

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:22.209
THIS TABLE DOES NOT PROVIDE THE

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.844
FREQUENCY OF LITIGATION BY

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.579
SECRET COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS OR IN

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.181
OTHER WORDS THIS TABLE DOES NOT

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:29.250
TELL YOU HOW LIKELY A PROJECT IS

01:36:29.316 --> 01:36:30.684
TO FACE LITIGATION BASED ON THE

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:33.254
SEQUEL COMPLIANCE PATHWAY USE.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.555
BUT WE DID DO THAT CALCULATION

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:36.824
AND FOUND THAT ACROSS ALL CITIES

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:38.425
CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT PROJECTS

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.027
AND DOES IT USED HEARING ARE THE

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.729
LEAST LIKELY TO BE LITIGATED.

01:36:41.795 --> 01:36:43.130
AND HE AYE OURS ARE THE MOST

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:45.166
LITIGATED WITHIN LOS ANGELES

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:46.400
PROJECTS WITH MITIGATED NEGATIVE

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:48.102
DECLARATIONS APPEAR TO BE THE

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:49.370
LEAST LIKELY TO BE NOTED

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.172
LITIGATED ANY AYE OURS ARE THE

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.506
MOST LIKELY TO BE LITIGATED.

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.809
AND SOME OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:58.379
THE RELEVANT SOMETIMES THE

01:36:58.445 --> 01:36:59.914
DISCONNECT BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.448
ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING AT THE

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.083
LOCAL LEVEL AND WHAT MIGHT

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.451
ACTUALLY BE OCCURRING.

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:05.753
AND SO NOW WILL MOVE TO SOME OF

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:06.387
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.222
FINDINGS THANK YOU MARA SO WHEN

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:09.790
KEY TAKEAWAYS THE NEED FOR MORE

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:10.858
AND BETTER DATA.

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:12.226
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT IT IS

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.160
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.695
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO FIX OUR

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:16.497
LAND USE REGULATION PROCESS.

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:17.998
BUT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE I

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:20.067
TOOK AS A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:20.834
TO COLLECT FOR THE CITIES.

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.169
INDEED WE FOUND SUBSTANTIAL

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:23.537
DISCREPANCIES BUT THE TAKE

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.172
BETWEEN THE DATA WE COLLECTED.

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:25.940
THE DATA THAT THE CITIES

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.875
THEMSELVES PROVIDED TO US WE ASK

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:28.943
FOR THEIR REPORTS TO COMPARE

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.844
WITH OUR INFORMATION OR THE DATA

01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:32.746
THAT CITIES OF SELF REPORTED TO

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:34.081
OTHER ACADEMIC SURVEYS.

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:36.517
OR INFORMATION REQUESTS FROM THE

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:37.284
STATE.

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.352
THIS WE'VE SEEN THERE'S AT LEAST

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.087
A COUPLE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:41.689
FOR THESE DISCREPANCIES IN PART

01:37:41.755 --> 01:37:43.224
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LOCAL LAND

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:44.458
USE REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN THEIR

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:45.960
VARIATION FROM JURISDICTION TO

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.161
JURISDICTION.

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:48.262
AND ALSO THE RESOURCE

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:49.230
LIMITATIONS OF MANY LOCAL

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.631
GOVERNMENTS AND THE FACT THAT

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.066
THEY MAY NOT BE PRIORITIZING

01:37:52.132 --> 01:37:53.734
DATA COLLECTION AVAILABILITY AND

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:55.502
ANALYSIS.

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:56.103
THE CHALLENGES WITH DATA

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:57.238
AVAILABILITY IN ACCESSIBILITY

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:58.439
HAVE BROUGHT IMPORTANCE AND NOT

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:00.040
JUST FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.976
PROJECTS LIKE OURS. FOR INSTANCE

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.644
LACK OF ACCESSIBLE OR AVAILABLE

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.412
DATA MADE DIRECTLY IMPACT THE

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:06.747
ABILITY OF CITY PLANNERS TO

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:07.948
UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PROCESS

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.583
EASIER FUNCTION OVERALL AND HOW

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:10.784
THIS PROCESS EASIER SHAPING

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:13.587
PROJECT PROPOSALS AND APPROVALS.

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:14.521
WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP ON MISSING

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:16.123
DATA MANY JURISDICTIONS NOTED

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.524
THEY WERE UNABLE TO EXTRACT THAT

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.627
DATA DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN THEIR

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:20.995
UNDERLYING DATA SYSTEMS?

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:22.162
OTHER CITIES REMARKED THAT THE

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.797
LIMITED CAPACITY OF THEIR ONLINE

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:25.332
PERMITTING SYSTEMS MAY PROJECT

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.835
MANAGEMENT MORE DIFFICULT AND

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.036
CREATED PROCESS INEFFICIENCIES.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.371
BUT THESE DATA PROBLEMS ALSO

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:31.672
LIKELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.173
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACTUALLY

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.541

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:56.163
AND THEY MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR

HOWEVER WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:53.120
THAT WE ARE STILL COLLECTING

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.655
DATA ON THESE QUESTIONS WERE

MORE DATA ON ADDITIONAL CITIES

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.196
TO CONDUCT MORE SOPHISTICATED

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:03.831

ADDITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS WILL

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.341
FIND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE

CANNOT CURRENTLY TO TAX.

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:17.411
ALONG THOSE LINES I WOULD ALSO

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:19.079
FLAG THAT ONE SHOULD NOT READ

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.414
TOO MUCH INTO LOW LITIGATION

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:21.882
APPEAL RATES IN CITIES THAT

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.484
THEMSELVES APPROVED VERY FEW

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:26.687
SUCH AS POLITICS IN THE CITY'S

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:27.888
THE LOW LITIGATION RATES MASK

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.356
UNDERLYING POLITICAL AND LEGAL

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:32.126

01:40:34.728 --> 01:40:36.029
COMBINING A QUANTITATIVE DATA

WITH AND INTERVIEW RESULTS OUR

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.499
CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:40:38.565 --> 01:40:39.600
THE FOCUS OF REFORM EFFORTS.

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:41.301
SHOULD BE ON THE LOCAL LAND USE

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:42.703

DRIVERS OF THAT SYSTEM.

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.007
BUT ANY REFORM EFFORTS MUST ALSO

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:50.110
BE CAREFUL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES

01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:51.278
AND ONLY RECENTLY HAVE BECOME

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:52.679
EMPOWERED ENOUGH TO HAVE A VOICE

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:54.748
IN THAT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:55.349
ANOTHER THING THAT A RESULT

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:56.717
SHOWS THAT STREAMLINING

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:57.684
VERTICALLY THROUGH THE USE OF

TEARING OFF A PRIOR GENERAL AND

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.723
IS AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR LOCAL

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:03.857
GOVERNMENTS TO FACILITATE

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.025
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:06.593
WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING IMPORTANT

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.061
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:09.630
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ELEMENTS.

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.965
IN FACT AS WHERE INDICATED WITH

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:12.533
ON THE PROJECTS THAT WENT

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:14.067
THROUGH TEARING RELATED

01:41:14.134 --> 01:41:17.738
EXCEPTIONS IT'S GLOBAL AND WERE

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:19.139
LITIGATED A LOWER RATES.

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:20.507
SO THAT'S OUR BASIC SUMMARY AND

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:21.675
WE LOOK FOR TO QUESTIONS WERE

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:24.845
HAPPY TO EXPLORE ANY ASPECTS.

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:25.479
OF THE PROJECT THAT PEOPLE WANT

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:28.515
A I'VE BEEN IN MORE DEEPLY ON

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.017
THANK YOU THANK YOU OFFER YOUR

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:31.285
RESEARCH AND VERY INTERESTING --

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:34.354
LET ME JUST ASK YOU ONE ISSUE

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:35.722
REALLY AND ALL THIS --

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:39.159
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:41.228
THE FACT THAT IT'S MORE OF THE

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.896
PLANNING PROCESS AT THE LOCAL

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:45.399
LEVEL.

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:45.999
HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH PART OF

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:47.668
THAT.

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.403
ENVIRONMENT RIGHT IN AND AND I

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.004
GUESS IS IT IS REALLY HARD TO

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.206
GET IT'S BEEN ASKED A COUPLE

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:54.441
TIMES BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:55.075
TO GET ANY KIND OF DATA ABOUT.

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:59.480
WHAT SORT OF --

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:00.948
IMPACT THE THREAT OF A POTENTIAL

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.783
LAWSUIT OR OR JUST THE THE USE

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.552
OF EQUAL AS A TOOL.

01:42:05.619 --> 01:42:07.387
MIGHT HAVE ON THE PROCESS AND

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:08.922
AND DID YOU GET ANY AT LEAST

01:42:08.989 --> 01:42:10.457
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT OR

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.959
WAS IT JUST IT'S IT'S JUST SO

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:12.860
DIFFICULT IF YOU ASK ABOUT THE

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:15.662
PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE PROJECT

01:42:15.729 --> 01:42:17.264
PROCESS BOTH ACTUALLY.

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:18.365
SO I THINK ON THE PROJECT

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.766
PROCESS RIGHT THE WHAT WE CAN

01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:21.535
PROVIDE AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:22.803
IS LOOKING AT LITIGATION AN

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:24.238
APPEAL RATES ACROSS

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:25.839
JURISDICTIONS AND SING OF THAT

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:27.374
RELATES AT ALL.

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:28.809
THE TIME FRAMES FOR APPROVAL OR

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.977
ENTITLEMENT RATES IN THOSE

01:42:30.043 --> 01:42:31.845
JURISDICTIONS AND WE DON'T SEE A

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:34.248
CLEAR RELATIONSHIP AT THIS POINT

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:34.681
IN TIME.

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:35.949
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:38.118
RELEVENT BUT IT IS NOT A VERY

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:39.920
STE IT'S NOT A STRONG A FACTOR

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.321
THAT IS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS IN

01:42:41.388 --> 01:42:42.756
TERMS OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:43.524
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:45.626
AT THE PLANNING STAGE THAT IS A

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:47.261
DIFFICULT DIFFERENT AN IMPORTANT

01:42:47.327 --> 01:42:48.428
QUESTION.

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.930
AND WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTED THE

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.698
DATA AT THE PLANNING STAGE TO

01:42:51.765 --> 01:42:53.000
UNDERSTAND.

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:55.202
WHAT KIND OF PROCESS THESE LOCAL

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:57.471
GOVERNMENTS ARE USING EDUCATION

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:58.705
RATES AROUND THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:00.140
AN IMPORTANT INTERESTING

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.308
RESEARCH QUESTION?

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:03.076
AND YOU KNOW THE LIMITATIONS WE

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.545
HAVE IN TERMS OF RESEARCHERS IN

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.213
TERMS OF GETTING FUNDING AND

01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:08.148
CAPACITY TO RESEARCH SORT OF

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:09.683
HAVE CONSTRAIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.652
WE'RE ABLE TO COLLECT.

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:12.819
OKAYI MEANT YOU HEARD THE

01:43:12.886 --> 01:43:14.021
DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.423
STANDING AND WHO DO YOU HAVE ANY.

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.325
YOU'RE ALL SMART LAWYERS DO YOU

01:43:18.392 --> 01:43:19.660
HAVE ANY.

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:21.662
THOUGHTS ABOUT.

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:23.030
THE ABUSE OR AN ASSET THE

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:25.132
APPROPRIATENESS OF THE USE OF OF

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:28.168
OF STANDING IN THIS SPACE --

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.236
MANY ANY ANY COMMENTS ON THAT I

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.704
HAVE A BLOG POST ON THAT THAT

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:31.972
I'D BE HAPPY TO PASS ON IF YOU'D

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.674
LIKE WHERE I WROTE A COMPARISON

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.042
OF NEED BUT FEDERAL STANDING

01:43:35.108 --> 01:43:35.943
LEAD --

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:37.511
JURISPRUDENCE IN SEQUENCE

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:38.912
STANDING JURISPRUDENCE.

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.681
I AND HOW IT THE DIFFERENCES

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:41.648
BETWEEN THE TWO STANDARDS AND

01:43:41.715 --> 01:43:43.050
WHAT DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT LEAD

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:44.051
INTO OUTCOMES THAT.

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:46.119
THAT'S A FEW YEARS OLD AT THIS

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:48.989
POINT SO YOU KNOW. ONE AND

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.090
THAT'S RELYING SOLELY ON

01:43:50.157 --> 01:43:51.425
PUBLISHED OPINIONS WERE DOING AN

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:53.493
ANALYSIS OF HOW COURTS ARE

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.729
APPLYING THE STANDARDS.

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:56.830
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.498
AS WE DO OUR LITIGATION ANALYSIS

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:00.100
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:01.368
LITTLE MORE INSIGHT TO LOOK AT

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:02.369
FOR INSTANCE.

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:03.870
THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY OF THE

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:05.739
LAWSUITS WE LOOKED AT WERE

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:07.040
DISMISSED ON STANDING GROUNDS --

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.642
DAD'S DATA WERE STILL TRYING TO

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:09.776
COLLECT.

01:44:09.843 --> 01:44:12.446
AT THE LITIGATION LEVEL ONE OF

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:15.482
THE OBSTACLES.

01:44:15.549 --> 01:44:17.351
DIFFICULT AND TO BE FRANK

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:19.019
EXPENSIVE TO ACCESS TO THE

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:21.622
ONLINE CORD PORTALS.

01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:23.223
WHAT WAS I SEE SAID TO THE

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:24.925
ONLINE COURT SYSTEMS HA HA OR

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.226
SOME OF THE DATA IS NOT EVEN ON

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:28.161
THE ONLINE SYSTEMS RIGHT?

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:33.233
OKAY QUESTION SEVEN YES --

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.868
YES I I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:38.438
LAWYERS WE LIKE TO GET.

01:44:38.505 --> 01:44:40.574
CAUGHT UP IN THE THE ALSO

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:41.108
ULTIMATE --

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:42.709
LAWSUIT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.077
THE FINDINGS THAT YOU MADE ON

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.113
THIS SORT OF BYZANTINE.

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:48.915
LOCAL ORDINANCE.

01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:50.517
ZONING LAW --

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:51.785
SITUATION THAT SITS UP THERE IN

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:54.154
ALL FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.622
CITIES --

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:56.590
BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES YOU

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:59.059
KNOW AGAIN THE RAP IS THAT SEEKS

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:00.260
WAS WHAT TRIPS SET UP.

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.796
RIGHT EVERYBODY LIKES TO SAY

01:45:02.863 --> 01:45:08.268
THAT AND YOU HAVE A STREAMLINED --

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:11.471
SEEK WHAT I'M IN I DON'T KILL

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.106
THE PROJECT FOR WHATEVER REASON.

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:16.309
RIGHT IN SICK WITH GETS THE HOOK

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:16.943
BECAUSE WE HAD TO GO THE SEQUEL

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.845
AND THAT AND THAT REQUIRED THIS

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:20.414
LENGTHY DISCUSSION.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.716
ON ON THINGS.

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:25.218
SO I I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

01:45:25.285 --> 01:45:27.020
I DON'T THINK WE WE'VE FOCUSED

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:28.855
ON THAT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME.

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:32.726
OF THOSE NINE CITIES THERE SOME

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.094
OF THESE --

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.697
CONFUSING SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:38.331
AND I LIVE IN FREMONT SO I'M

01:45:38.398 --> 01:45:39.066
SORT OF FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:39.900
THESE.

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.268
SOME OF THE CITIES AROUND ME

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:44.471
THAT MAKE THE PROCESS.

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:45.972
NOT THE IT'S NOT THAT THE THE

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:47.841
DISCUSSION WE HAVE BUT JUST JUST

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:48.809
TRYING.

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:51.044
TO LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT THEY

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.846
DO THAT MAKES IT. NOW FOR

01:45:52.913 --> 01:45:57.184
IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVEN AN ENTITLED.

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:58.285
PIECE OF LAND TO GET SOMETHING

01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:59.286
THE BALLOT --

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:00.353
DEFERRED AT JULIE I THINK CAN

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.455
REALLY GIVE GOOD EXAMPLES ON

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:01.888
YEAH -- I

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:05.192
MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF I I THINK

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.960
WHAT'S YOU KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.395
THE BENEFITS OF PLANNING AND

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:10.464
SPECIFIC PLANNING PARTICULARLY

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.099
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TEARING AND

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.401
AND THE TIME SAVING YOU KNOW

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:15.569
BENEFIT OF THAT --

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:16.770
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS A LOT OF

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:19.005
CITIES HAVE INTRODUCED --

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:20.574
KIND OF NEW LAYERS OF APPROVAL

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.209
THREE SPECIFIC PLANNING SO.

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.143
THEY'VE INTRODUCED APPROVALS

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:25.946
RELATED TO SPUR --

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:28.181
REDWOOD CITY IS AN EXAMPLE SAN

01:46:28.248 --> 01:46:30.383
FRANCISCO LA --

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.318
WHERE IF YOU'RE DEVELOPING

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:32.586
WITHIN THE SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS

01:46:32.652 --> 01:46:33.487
YOU CAN BENEFI FROM

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:34.688
STREAMLINING BUT THERE'S

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:35.956
ACTUALLY AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF

01:46:36.022 --> 01:46:37.224
APPROVAL THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.425
GET THAT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:40.227
GET IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE A SPECIFIC

01:46:40.293 --> 01:46:41.528
PLAN AREA?

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.630
THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT --

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.265
LIKE AN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:47.834
BOARD OR HISTORICAL SO.

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:49.970
IT REALLY VARIES --

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:53.406
SO YOU KNOW TYPICALLY THAT KIND

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:55.408
OF APPROVAL IS --

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:59.713
IN LA IT'S MORE ASCETIC ORIENTED

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.515
IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S OR SIMILAR

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:02.482
FINDINGS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE

01:47:02.549 --> 01:47:02.983
FOR C. U. P..

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:04.184
SO EVEN THAT KIND OF THE

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:05.318
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT LOCAL

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:07.120
GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING AT YOU

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.688
KNOW VERY SUBSTANTIALLY --

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:09.990
ANOTHER COMMON THING WE'RE

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.858
SEEING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:12.459
IS.

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:13.994
DEVELOP BAD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.695
TRYING TO BAKE IN LIKE CERTAIN

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.831
POLICY OBJECTIVES INTO THEIR

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:18.999
ZONING CODE --

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:22.169
SO YOU KNOW OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE --

01:47:22.235 --> 01:47:24.604
INSTEAD OF JUST REDUCING MINIMUM

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:26.540
REQUIREMENTS.

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.275
CREATED THE C. U. P. PROCESS

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:29.609
WHERE YOU CAN GET LOWERED

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.077
PARKING BUT YOU HAVE TO GO

01:47:31.144 --> 01:47:32.679
THROUGH THIS UP PROCESS YOU KNOW

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:33.747
TO MAKE SURE YOUR MEETING

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:35.582
CERTAIN CONDITIONS RIGHT.

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:36.283
THAT JUST KIND OF ADDS ANOTHER

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:38.051
LAYER I'M SANTA MONICA IS

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:40.253
ANOTHER REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.088
NOT ANYMORE BUT YOU KNOW DURING

01:47:42.155 --> 01:47:43.390
OUR STUDY YEARS THEY HAD THIS

01:47:43.456 --> 01:47:44.658
VERY COMPLICATED.

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.126
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT PROCESS TO

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:47.694
ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:48.962
DELIVERING CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:47:49.029 --> 01:47:50.363
COMMUNITY BENEFITS.

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.065
THAT REALLY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:54.434
PRO LONG TO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.169
SEES AND REQUIRED A LOT MORE

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.271
INPUT FROM CITY COUNCIL THAN

01:47:58.338 --> 01:47:59.339
WOULD OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED GIVE

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:00.874
ME SOME IDEA BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:02.442
LIKE THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:05.378
ARE JUST THE BUZZ WORD IN THE IN

01:48:05.445 --> 01:48:07.013
THE PLANNING --

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.783
ARENA AND NOW WHERE PEOPLE GO

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.218
I'VE AT LEAST I'VE HEARD.

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:14.654
YEARS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:17.190
THE THE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:48:17.257 --> 01:48:19.092
BUT ALSO YOU GOT FIVE THOUSAND

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:20.527
DIFFERENT GROUPS AT ONE FIVE

01:48:20.594 --> 01:48:22.462
THOUSAND DIFFERENT THINGS AND

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:23.763
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU.

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:24.731
A PIECE MAJORITY THE CITY

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:26.399
COUNCIL.

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:27.767
YEAH IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.169
QUESTION I THINK CITIES ARE KIND

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:30.036
OF ATTACKING IT FROM TWO

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:31.605
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES YOU CAN

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:34.341
HAVE A CITY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO --

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:35.942
THAT CEATES BRIGHT LINE RULES

01:48:36.009 --> 01:48:36.743
LIKE YOUR PROJECT WILL PAY THIS

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.678
IMPACT FEE IT WILL HAVE THIS

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:40.013
PERCENTAGE AFFORDABLE.

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.281
YOU KNOW IT WILL PROVIDE THIS

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.616
AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE SANTA

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:43.884
MONICA DID A REALLY INTERESTING

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.285
THING WHERE YOU KNOW THEY KIND

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:46.419
OF RECOGNIZED.

01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:47.621
WE MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:49.356
NEGOTIATE THESE BENEFITS FROM

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:52.025
THE DEVELOPER ON A ONE OFF BASIS

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:54.527
RIGHT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS --

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:55.829
WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ACTUALLY

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:56.963
MIGHT BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.398
DEVELOPERS SINCE THERE'S SOME

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:00.200
FLEXIBILITY --

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:02.402
AND YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS REALLY

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:05.472
CREATED TIME INEFFICIENCIES --

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:08.341
AND A LOT OF WORK.

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:09.542
BUT IT KIND OF SHOWS THAT YOU

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:10.644
KNOW CITIES ARE TRYING TO SORT

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.579
OF TAKE THESE TWO APPROACHES AND

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:15.282
THERE'S PROS AND CONS TO EACH --

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:18.285
IN TERMS OF PROCESS. ONE THE

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:19.886
FINDINGS THAT YOU MAKE IS THAT

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:22.055
EVEN IF WE STREAMLINED THE

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:23.890
SEQUEL PROCESS WITH THE TWELVE

01:49:23.957 --> 01:49:25.125
MILLION BEER BILLS WE'RE GOING

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.259
TO GET FROM TE ASSEMBLY.

01:49:26.326 --> 01:49:28.428
IN LESS THE LOCALS INVEST IN

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:30.196
PLANNING PROCESS IT'S ALL FOR

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:31.731
NOT CAN YOU FLESH THAT OUT A

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:32.999
LITTLE BIT YEAH AND ACTUALLY I

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.367
THINK THIS GOES TO I THINK ONE

01:49:34.434 --> 01:49:36.736
OF THE SUB TEXAS CENTER ALAN'S

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:37.671
QUESTION EARLIER.

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:38.538
THE PROBLEM FOR LOCAL

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:40.407
GOVERNMENTS IS THEY PAY FOR THE

01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:41.675
SPECIFIC PLANNING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:42.876
REVIEW PROCESS.

01:49:42.943 --> 01:49:44.377
BUDGET PROPONENTS PAY FOR

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:45.745
PROJECT LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:46.646
REVIEW NOW SAYS.

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.814
STILL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.182
EITHER FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:50.817
OR DOESN'T HAVE THE POLITICAL

01:49:50.884 --> 01:49:51.952
AND SEND IT TO DO T.

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.386
OR SIMPLY JUST HAS CAPACITY

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:54.220
ISSUES.

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:56.523
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT UP

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:58.425
FRONT INVESTMENT.

01:49:58.491 --> 01:50:00.493
AND THEY'LL PUSH IT ON TO THE

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.995
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT PROPONENTS.

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:04.764
THAT IN TURN WILL NOT ONLY MEAN

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:05.665
IT THE PROPONENTS PAYING THE

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:06.800
COST FOR THE PRIME OF YOU BUT

01:50:06.866 --> 01:50:08.601
ALSO EXTEND THE TIME LINES.

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:10.203
AND CREATE HIGHER LEVELS OF

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.838
UNCERTAINTY PROJECT APPROVAL.

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:14.674
IF CITIES ARE WILLING AND ABLE

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:17.577
TO DO THAT UP CONS IN TERMS OF

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:18.745
PROJECT.

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:20.447
ACTIVITY SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:23.383
OUTDATED GENERAL PLANS ARE

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:24.084
HOUSING PLANS --

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:24.884
WE HAVE SOME.

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:26.419
COASTAL AREAS WE REPRESENT WE

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:28.221
NEED TO HAVE AN UPDATE ON ON ON

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.023
THOSE THINGS WE'RE HAVING THE

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:33.460
PROJECT PROPONENT HAVING TO TRY

01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:33.727
TO STICK.

01:50:33.793 --> 01:50:35.762
THEIR RIGHT. TWENTY NINETEEN

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:38.398
PROJECT INTO A TWENTY YEAR OLD A

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.333
GENERAL PLAN.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:43.937
AND IT'S WITH THE PROBLEM.

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.071
YEAH I MEAN THAT IS.

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:47.040
YEAH THAT IS PART OF THE DYNAMIC

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.608
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:50.276
UPDATED GENERAL PLANS UPDATED

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:52.145
CPAS SPECIFIC PLANS ALL CAN

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:53.980
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:55.415
TEARING --

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:56.883
AND EVEN IF SOME OF THE

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.718
EXEMPTIONS AND JULIA CAN TALK

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:00.120
ABOUT THIS IN MORE DETAIL EVEN

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:01.621
SOME OF THE STATUTORY AND

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.723
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS REQUIRED

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.325
HEARING TO BE FUNCTIONAL.

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:07.761
SO THERE IS AN OVERLAP BETWEEN

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:10.597
THOSE AS WELL.

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:11.297
IN CHAIR SOMEONE.

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:13.700
WE'VE IT SEEMS SEND BUT I'M

01:51:13.767 --> 01:51:14.901
PROBABLY WRONG ON THIS THAT THAT

01:51:14.968 --> 01:51:17.303
WE DO VARIOUS CATEGORY COLLECTS

01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.772
EMPTIONS SINCE SPECIFIC

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:21.307
EXEMPTIONS AND IN CITIES SOMEHOW

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:22.976
DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THEY

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:23.576
DON'T THEY DON'T.

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:25.145
THEY DON'T WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:26.446
THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE DO THIS

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:30.750
BECAUSE THIS CRISIS COMING OUT.

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:31.885
TO UP THE PROCESS I DON'T

01:51:31.951 --> 01:51:33.019
SOMETIMES A READING YOUR REPORTS

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.521
SOMETIMES I THINK MAYBE THEY

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:35.121
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PROCESS

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:35.855
SPEED UP.

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:36.489
OR IS THERE SOME

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:39.159
MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT'S

01:51:39.225 --> 01:51:42.595
AVAILABLE OUT THERE.

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:46.066
FOR WHAT'S THE RUB I'M AYE.

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:46.900
DO YOU WANT TO BUT I WAS JUST

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.002
GOING TO NOTE THAT IT MAY NOT BE

01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:50.570
THAT THAT'S TRUE FOR CATEGORICAL

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.105
EXEMPTIONS GENERALLY BUT THAT

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:53.139
THERE IS MORE USE OF CERTAIN

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:55.175
KINDS OF CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS

01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:56.276
AS COMPARED TO OTHERS.

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:57.644
THEY THINK THIS HIGHLIGHTS WHAT

01:51:57.710 --> 01:51:59.179
WAS DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.880
PANEL AS WELL BUT FOR EXAMPLE.

01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:02.749
BREAKING OUT WHAT WE HAVE I MEAN

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:04.784
YOU HAVE. FOR URBAN INFILL

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:06.953
PROJECTS S. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:08.755
TWO OF THE PROJECTS WE LOOKED A

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.090
FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY OF

01:52:10.156 --> 01:52:11.758
CHEMICAL EXTENSIONS AND THEN IN

01:52:11.825 --> 01:52:14.394
THE OTHERS IT WAS.

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:14.994
ONE TO THREE YOU CAN SEE A BIG

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.763
DIFFERENCE AND WHICH ONES ARE

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.264
BEING USED. TO THAT MAY SPEAK

01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:20.266
MORE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.435
CATALOG EXEMPTION RATHER THAN

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.036
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE WILLING

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:24.003
TO USE THEM.

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:25.472
AND I THINK ANOTHER FACTOR IS

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:26.739
THE UNDERLYING POLITICS OF THE

01:52:26.806 --> 01:52:27.841
LOCAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN THE

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:31.444
IMPLICATION OF DISCRETIONARY

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:33.012
REVIEW.

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:33.613
IS THAT OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.414
DOES WANT APPROVE OF DOES NOT

01:52:34.481 --> 01:52:34.981
WANT TO APPROVE A PROJECT IT

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:35.682
DOESN'T HAVE.

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:36.516
TO AND DISCRETIONARY REVIEW GETS

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:39.519
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT VETO POWER

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:41.588
OVER WHETHER PROJECTS PROCEED.

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:43.690
AND THAT IS WELL YOU CAN OBSERVE

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:45.325
IT IN OUR DATA AND I WOULD BE

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:46.759
SHOCKED.

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:47.727
IF THIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:49.629
DIFFERENT IN MOST CITIES AROUND

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:52.198
THE STATE SO I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE

01:52:52.265 --> 01:52:53.299
QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN

01:52:53.366 --> 01:52:55.001
IT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

01:52:55.068 --> 01:52:57.303
YOU'D MENTIONED EARLIER THE NEED

01:52:57.370 --> 01:52:58.972
TO COLLECT MORE DATA --

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:00.306
I THINK WE'RE ALL SORT OF

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:01.741
OPERATING A LITTLE BIT IN THE

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:03.376
BLIND I THINK WERE OPERATING

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:05.578
FROM OLD INFORMATION POTENTIALLY

01:53:05.645 --> 01:53:07.947
FROM THE MYTHOLOGY AND THE

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:10.950
ILLUSION OF WHO THE BAD GUY IS

01:53:11.017 --> 01:53:13.786
IF THERE IS A BAD CAR CERTAINLY

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:14.420
WHO THE IT WHAT THE IMPEDIMENTS

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:14.621
ARE.

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:15.989
IF YOU WERE TO CRAFT SOME

01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:17.891
LEGISLATION IF WE WERE TO CRAFT

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:20.593
SOME LEGISLATION TO ASSIST IN.

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:21.327
OBTAINING THAT ADDITIONAL DATA

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:24.430
THAT AS FIGURE OUT JUST WHERE

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:26.266
THE PROBLEMS ARE WHAT THEY ARE

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:27.033
AND THEN HOW TO FIX THEM.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.868
WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:31.704
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN

01:53:31.771 --> 01:53:33.606
THAT LEGISLATION?

01:53:33.673 --> 01:53:34.307
I'M GOING TO DEFER TO JULIA

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.743
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE LEAD ON DATA

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:37.343
COLLECTION SHERRY [inaudible]

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:39.179
WELL.

01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:40.580
I'M SO.

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.215
THERE IS NO THERE IS RECENT

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:43.516
LEGISLATION AROUND --

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:44.851
INCREASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:46.686
UNDER THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH

01:53:46.753 --> 01:53:47.320
I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD FIRST

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:48.221
STEP.

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:49.522
I THINK THE ISSUE IS AND WHEN

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:52.091
YOU TALK TO PLANNERS --

01:53:52.158 --> 01:53:54.093
IS THAT THEIR ABILITY TO TRACK

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.262
DATA INTERNALLY IS VERY LIMITED

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.864
IN ITS VERY CONSTRAINED BY THE

01:53:57.931 --> 01:53:59.399
EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE

01:53:59.465 --> 01:54:01.367
IN PLACE --

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.203
AND YOU KNOW AS WE MENTIONED IN

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.337
OUR TAKE AWAYS.

01:54:04.404 --> 01:54:06.206
IT ALSO REALLY IMPACTS HOW THEY

01:54:06.272 --> 01:54:08.541
MANAGE PROJECTS --

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:10.343
SO I THINK ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.045
GOVERNMENTS IN A PARTICULARLY

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:14.347
SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T.

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:15.815
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF

01:54:15.882 --> 01:54:17.650
MANAGE THESE LARGER SOFTWARE

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:19.586
PLATFORMS AND WHEN I'M TALKING

01:54:19.652 --> 01:54:20.787
ABOUT THESE PLATFORMS IT'S

01:54:20.853 --> 01:54:24.691
THINGS LIKE A REALLY COMMON --

01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:28.728
USES EXCEL OF IT'S NOT LIKE

01:54:28.795 --> 01:54:31.798
UNIFORMLY ADOPTED BUT THE

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:32.966
UTILITY OF EXCEL --

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:34.067
LIKE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN ADD

01:54:34.133 --> 01:54:35.602
DIFFERENT MODULES BUT THAT

01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:37.470
DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO

01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:39.005
MANAGE THOSE MODELS TO PAY FOR

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:40.707
THOSE MODELS --

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:42.842
SO A LOT OF SMALLER CITIES YOU

01:54:42.909 --> 01:54:46.012
KNOW JUST HAVE VERY BASIC.

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.981
KIND OF ACCESS --

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:49.616
YEAH PERHAPS WHAT WE CAN DO

THE RIGHT PROBLEM.

01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.625
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT

01:54:58.691 --> 01:55:00.593
SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED MORE DATA.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.295
AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT SO

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.763

ANY EFFORT TO WE CAN SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.611
WON'T CHANGE THE OTHER

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:54.046
IMPEDIMENTS IDENTIFIED BY

02:05:54.113 --> 02:05:55.848
DEVELOPERS NOR WILL THEY CHANGE

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:57.216
THE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS THAT WERE

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:59.451
HIGHLIGHTED IN TODAY'S PANELS

02:05:59.518 --> 02:06:00.986
ALL IT WILL DO WILL --

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:02.655
WILL HURT THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:06.025
SEE WHAT PROTECTS AND PROVIDES A

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:06.525
VOICE.

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:07.159
TO WE REALIZE THAT THOSE OTHER

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.327
IMPEDIMENTS MAYBE HARDER MORE

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:09.862
DIFFICULT TO LEGISLATE BUT WE'RE

02:06:09.929 --> 02:06:11.163
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:13.299
LEGISLATURE ON ADVANCING POLICY

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:15.301
THAT INCREASES HOUSING SUPPLY

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:16.769
THANK YOU.

02:06:16.835 --> 02:06:18.637
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS.

CONSIDERABLE TIME OVER THE YEARS --

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:29.181
AND YOUR STAFF'S WORKING ON SEA

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:30.716
QUEST AND I THINK PART OF THE

02:06:30.783 --> 02:06:32.284
PROBLEM IS THAT --

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:33.619
YOU KNOW PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:34.386
THIS BUILDING GET IN THEIR

02:06:34.453 --> 02:06:35.821
TRENCHES AND THE DEBATE IS

02:06:35.888 --> 02:06:38.624
FRAMED AS SEEK WHAT IS THE CAUSE

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:40.459
OF THE HOUSING CRISIS OR THERE'S

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.961
NO PROBLEM WITH SEQUEL AT ALL.

02:06:42.027 --> 02:06:43.495
AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S NEITHER

02:06:43.562 --> 02:06:44.596
OF THE ABOVE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:46.065
LOOKING AT THE EIGHTY P. STUDY

02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:47.266
AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW SOME

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:48.300
DEVELOPERS SAY.

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:49.635
SEQUENCES HUGE PROBLEM THEY SAID

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:50.936
HOWEVER SEEK WITH SUPPORTERS

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:52.538
MAINTAIN THAT IS CRITICAL TO

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:53.706
ANALYZE AND MITIGATE

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.507
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED

02:06:55.574 --> 02:06:57.009
WITH HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.610
BEHALF OF CD I LET ME SAY

02:06:58.677 --> 02:06:59.712
ABSOLUTELY THAT IS TRUE AND

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.113
SEQUEL PLAYS.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:05.484
A CRITICAL ROLE THAT BEING SAID

02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:06.819
SINGLE LIKE THE TAX CODE RIGHT

02:07:06.885 --> 02:07:08.487
WE SAT WE WE'VE PUT IT DOWN IF

02:07:08.554 --> 02:07:09.621
YOU LOOK AT SEE QUITE AS THE LAW

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.023
IT COMES WITH A TREMENDOUS

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:12.124
AMOUNT OF STREAMLINING.

02:07:12.191 --> 02:07:14.059
FROM ITS INITIAL INCENTIVE IN

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:14.793
SENT --

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.829
INCEPTION TO THE BILLS THAT

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:18.397
WE'VE PASSED OVER THE YEAR BY

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.432
INGENIOUS ATTORNEYS FIGURE OUT

02:07:20.499 --> 02:07:23.102
WAYS TO FILE LITIGATIONS FOR

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:25.070
REASONS THAT OFTENTIMES HAVE

02:07:25.137 --> 02:07:25.604
NOTHING TO TO DO WITH THE

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.672
ENVIRONMENT.

02:07:26.739 --> 02:07:27.673
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:29.008
ISSUE IS IN THIS BUILDING IT'S

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:30.109
NOT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:30.175 --> 02:07:31.777
PROTECTION I CAN'T RECALL THE

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:32.544
LAST TIME I GOT UP BEFORE YOU

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:33.345
AND SAID.

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:34.646
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:36.548
BAR IS TOO HIGH BUT WHAT I DO

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:38.584
REGULARLY GET UP AND SAY IS WE

02:07:38.650 --> 02:07:40.252
HAVE A SEAT WHAT LITIGATION

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:42.154
ABUSE PROBLEM AND THIS IS BORNE

02:07:42.221 --> 02:07:43.722
OUT BY THE SEA.

02:07:43.789 --> 02:07:45.891
QUOTA QUOTE EXEMPTIONSTHAT HAVE

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:46.959
COME WHEN PEOPLE POINT TO THE

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:48.160
BIGGER MEANNESS AND I CAN'T

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:49.328
REMEMBER IF IT WAS JUSTICE ROBY

02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:50.863
ARE OR THE EIGHTY P.

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:52.064
REPRESENTATIVE THEY SAID THOSE.

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:53.599
ACTUALLY WERE NOT EXEMPTIONS

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:55.667
THOSE THOSE PROJECTS HAD TO MEET

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:57.636
A HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL BAR AND

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:58.971
WE ARE THOSE WHERE THE BILL'S

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:00.606
WENT TO WAS GETTING SOME

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:01.373
LITIGATION STREAMLINING SO I

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.041
THINK.

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:03.142
PUTTING OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:04.276
WORKING ON THIS ON THE

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:06.512
STREAMLINING IS WELL WORTH IT

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.814
AND JUST TO TO CLOSE A COMMENT

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:12.751
ON THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:13.919
PRESENTED --

02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:22.227
THREE YEAR --

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:24.129
BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:26.065

HOMELESS SHELTERS WERE

02:08:31.103 --> 02:08:31.837
CHALLENGED.

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:34.440
AND 70% OF THOSE CHALLENGE WHEN

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:36.575
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:37.810
ISSUES THANK YOU SO IT JUST

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:38.644

VERY MUCH IN THE HALL INTO NIGHT

02:08:47.653 --> 02:08:49.855
STUDY WAS BASED ON A VERY SMALL

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:50.923
SAMPLE SIZE.

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:53.859
OF PROJECTS THE GET LITIGATED SO

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.060
AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO GET BETTER

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:56.228
DATA -- WE

02:08:56.295 --> 02:08:57.796
TRY TO PRESENT SOME OF IT HERE

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.631
BUT RATHER THAN HAVE DUELING

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:01.467
NUMBERS WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO

02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:02.401

THANK YOU AND THANK YOU I'M AN

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:10.542

ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.879
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I

02:09:13.946 --> 02:09:15.214
WANTED TO ECHO CBI IS COMING I

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:15.547
THINK.

02:09:15.614 --> 02:09:17.149
THE ANSWER FOR US IS SOMEWHERE

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.517
IN THE MIDDLE I THINK --

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:20.352
AS CASSIE MENTION WE HAVE BEEN

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:21.920
ENTRENCHED IN OUR OWN CAMPS I'VE

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:23.655
BEEN EDUCATED MEMBERS ON WHERE

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:25.257
THEY NEED TO SORT OF FIND MORE

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:27.292
MIDDLE GROUND IN TERMS OF SEQUEL

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:28.727
ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH

02:09:28.794 --> 02:09:29.661
DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:30.929
CALIFORNIA.

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:32.464
BUT I DO THINK --

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:33.699
AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.334
USED TO LITIGATE SEQUEL ON THE

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.169
PLAINTIFF'S SIDE AND ALSO

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:38.303
REPRESENT THE AGENCIES IN

02:09:38.370 --> 02:09:39.638
ANOTHER CAPACITY.

02:09:39.705 --> 02:09:41.907
THE THREAT OF SEQUEL LITIGATION

02:09:41.974 --> 02:09:43.842
IS OFTEN JUST AS MUCH AS OF A

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:45.711
PROBLEM AS THE ACTUAL FILING OF

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:47.412
THE LITIGATION I THINK WE WE

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:49.081
ECHO YOUR POINTS THAT MORE DATA

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:51.216
ON A SORT OF THOSE THAT ARE NOT

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:52.818
CAPTURED.

02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:53.485
NECESSARILY IN THE DATA WE HEARD

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:54.786
TODAY -- IS

02:09:54.853 --> 02:09:55.954
IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS

02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:57.890
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.491
DOING STATISTICS --

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:01.627
AND AS I THINK CABALLERO MENTION

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:05.230
THIS IS A CAN BE USED --

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:05.797
FOR YOUR NARRATIVE AND SO I

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.933
AGREE HAVING THIS TODAY THANK

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:11.837
YOU SITE I'D LIKE TO SUBMIT THAT

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:14.106
THE TEST THAT THE DATA DONE BY A

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:17.242
UNIVERSITY IS IMPARTIAL AND

02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:18.744
THERE'S NO FINANCIAL INTEREST.

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:21.013
INVOLVED IN IT BUT AGAIN THERE'S

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:22.848
A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAT I

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:24.416
THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

02:10:24.483 --> 02:10:26.151
WHETHER IT'S TO DISCUSS SEEK

02:10:26.218 --> 02:10:27.553
WHAT WARS.

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.254
OTHER IMPEDIMENTS WHICH SEEM

02:10:29.321 --> 02:10:31.256
RATHER CLEAR ARE CAUSING SOME OF

02:10:31.323 --> 02:10:33.392
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE OUR LAST

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:34.193
PUBLIC.

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:36.028
WITNESS NAME AND AFFILIATION IN

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:39.097
YOUR TWO MINUTES PLEASE OR LESS

02:10:39.164 --> 02:10:40.999
IS FINE.

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:41.767
TOO I'M SORRY EARNED AND I'M

02:10:41.833 --> 02:10:42.367
WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW

02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:43.001
AND POVERTY --

02:10:43.068 --> 02:10:44.736
AS BOTH A HOUSING ADVOCATE AND

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:46.238
SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED WITH LOW

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.339
INCOME COMMUNITY GROUPS

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:48.807
NAVIGATING THE SECRET PROCESS

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:50.108
IT'S BEEN --

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:51.610
FAIRLY FRUSTRATING TO WATCH SEEK

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:53.845
WOULD BE BLAMED FOR THE HOUSING

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.080
CRISIS AT TIMES.

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:56.415
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:58.984
WHILE OFTEN UNDERSTANDABLY THESE

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:01.186
CONVERSATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:02.187
LITIGATION AND WHAT THAT LOOKS

02:11:02.254 --> 02:11:03.722
LIKE AND WHAT PROJECTS ARE BEING

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:04.957
CHALLENGED IN COURT.

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:06.124
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:08.427
IN MIND THE OTHER 99% OF SECRET

02:11:08.493 --> 02:11:09.728
PROJECTS --

02:11:09.795 --> 02:11:10.896
AND WHAT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT THE

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.731
SEEKER PROCESS I THINK IT'S

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:13.966
REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:15.734
PROJECTS AREN'T THE SAME AT THE

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:16.602
BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:18.470
SECRET PROCESS AND WHAT HAPPENS

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:19.972
IN THE MIDDLE --

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:21.607
IS WHAT'S BEEN CALLED THE HEART

02:11:21.673 --> 02:11:22.674
OF SEQUEL WHICH IS PUBLIC

02:11:22.741 --> 02:11:24.042
PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC

02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:25.210
INFORMATION.

02:11:25.277 --> 02:11:29.181
AND THE ABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES --

02:11:29.248 --> 02:11:31.617
TO TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT THE TRUE

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:33.919
IT IS I'VE SEEN COMMUNITY GROUPS
