AUTHOR'S INTENTION HERE AND I

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.301
THINK DURING A JUDICIARY

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:18.469
APPEARED REMOTELY. SOME

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.671
QUESTIONS AND I THINK IT KIND

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.240
OF GOES TO THE HEART OF WHAT

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:25.977
CREDIT IS. OUR CREDIT SYSTEM IN

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:29.814
THE UNITED STATES IS PREMISED

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.049
ON PERSONAL RELIABILITY. AND

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:32.883
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.419
HERE IS THAT WE ARE

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:39.123
INCORPORATING INTO THE CALCULUS

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.725
OF PERSONAL RELIABILITY BASED

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:46.464
ON PAST PERFORMANCE IN OTHER

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.002
EXTERNALITIES. ON WHAT. IN THIS

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:52.937
I HAVE SOME MERIT THAT THERE

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:55.840
ARE MANY INSTANCES THERE'S NOT

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:56.874
ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.211
IN NEED TO. WHERE THE NECESSARY

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.680
CREDIT FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. THE

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.915
CONCERN WITH THIS IS THAT WE

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.817
COULD BE ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:10.154
THE CREDIT PROCESS ON FAIRLY

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:12.390
WHAT I MEAN BY UNFAIRLY IS

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:14.692
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SEGMENT

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:16.694
OF THE VISUALS FOR HAVING THEIR

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:20.698
RENT CHECK. FOR BY WHETHER YOU

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.367
NEED TO EAD ANY THERE SO

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:29.440
SERVICE. WHAT DO NOT MISS ALL

00:38:29.507 --> 00:38:31.609
OF OUR ACTION EIGHT WERE MORE

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.444

THIS- ON ALL TO NEEDS TO HAVE

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.985
DISCRETIONARY RENT CHECKS I

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.521
CAN'T. PROCESS DONE THE AUTHORS

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.857
PUT IN THIS PLEDGES. SO I WOULD

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:47.458
THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE MADE

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:51.395
MUCH MORE. COMPREHENSIVE AND

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.431
MORE FLEXIBLE IF THIS WERE

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:56.767
APPLIED TO ALL RENTERS THAT

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:59.370

ALL BOARDS THE REPORTING IT. I

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.652
THAT WOULD BE A EQUITABLE TO

LOOK AFTER BOTH THE INTEREST

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:21.759

PRESIDENT. SENATOR HERTZBERG.

THERE ARE A FEW THINGS. WE DO

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:23.437

01:32:46.794 --> 01:32:49.163
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT VOICE.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.998
WE FOUND IN DURING THE BUSH

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.067
VERSUS GORE CASE THAT THEY WERE

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:54.669
53% OF THE MACHINES IN

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.671
CALIFORNIA THE HANGING CHAD

01:32:56.737 --> 01:33:01.342
PROBLEMS. THE VOTERS AUTHORIZED

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:01.943
TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:04.078
BOND ISSUE TO FIX THAT. WE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.414
TALKED TO FOLKS THAT- OFTEN A

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.582
RENTERS IN. REVENUE PLACE AND

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:10.084
FIND OUT THAT THE THIRTY DAY

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.386
LIMITATION ON. REGISTRATION

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:13.621
INHIBITED A WHOLE HOST OF

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:16.390
PEOPLE TO VOTE. WE MOVED TO

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:17.591
FIFTEEN DAYS AND THEN KIND OF A

01:33:17.658 --> 01:33:20.328
PARTIAL SAME DAY REGISTRATION.

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:23.597
A FEW YEARS AGO. LOOK AT THIS

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:26.133
IDEA VOTE CENTERS. FOLKS WORK

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.035
ACROSS TOWN CAN'T GET BACK HOME

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.470
BECAUSE THEY GOT PROBLEMS OF

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.738
THEIR KIDS OR THIS OR SICK OR

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:32.440
WORK OR SOMETHING AND THEY MISS

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:34.709
VOTING. SO WE SET UP VOTE

01:33:34.775 --> 01:33:36.277
CENTERS WITH ELIMINATE THE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.379
TRADITIONAL VOTING PLACES WOULD

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.481
REDUCE THE FEW BECAUSE OF COSTS

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:41.749
BUT THE REALITY IS. HE WANTED

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:42.950
TO VOTE YOUR COMMITTEE YOU

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:45.553
COULD. SOME HAVE GONE TO ALMOST

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:49.857
ALL VOTE BY. IT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.559
DOING HERE I DIDN'T DO TO BUILD

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:53.227
THIS FEEL THE WHEN I FIRST GOT

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.996
HERE INSTEAD WE CHOSE TO PURSUE

01:33:55.062 --> 01:34:00.768
THE ISSUE CENTERS SOME COUNTIES

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:01.235
FELT THIS WOULD BE TOO

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.837
EXPENSIVE. BUT SIR OF THE

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:05.339
PANDEMIC CHAO. WITH THE LARGER

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.743
DYNAMIC IS WE AS ELECTED

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:10.845
OFFICIALS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.680

EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE TO

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:20.488
PARTICIPATE AND SO THIS IS JUST

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:22.056
ONE IT DOESN'T ELIMINATE PEOPLE

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:22.723
VOTING THEIR COMMITTEE THE

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:25.559

THEY WORK ON THE LA WHAT IT IS.

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:38.406
I JUST STOPPED A MOMENT BECAUSE

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:42.476
THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:45.079

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.570
PEOPLE WHO AGREE CONCERN ABOUT

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:33.474

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:48.422
ACCURATE. SEVEN DAYS. AS THE

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:51.959

01:38:57.965 --> 01:39:12.112
LAYING OFF. STILL THERE TEENS.

WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.716
QUESTIONS AND HE CAN ANSWER

01:39:15.783 --> 01:39:17.017
THOSE QUESTIONS. IN THE

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:22.656
CLOTHES. THAT'S APPROPRIATE. I

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:23.524
HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:27.861
FROM LOS ANGELES THAT. VOTING

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:30.731
IS THE BEATING HEART OF OUR

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:33.967
DEMOCRACY. MAKING CERTAIN THAT

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.936
PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IS PART AND

01:39:36.003 --> 01:39:37.004
PARCEL OF THE AMERICAN

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:40.307
EXPERIENCE. I THINK WE'VE HEARD

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:43.844
THAT. ROSS THIS IS ALSO A

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:44.645
SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:48.015
LEGAL SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK WE

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:49.083
HAVE TO MARRY OUT. THE

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:51.785
PRAGMATIC ASPECTS VOTING AS

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.120
WELL AS MAKING CERTAIN THAT

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.955
WE'RE LOOKING AFTER THE

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:55.456
ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL

01:39:55.522 --> 01:39:56.490
IMPLICATIONS OF OUR DECISION.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:40:00.060
SO I. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:04.832
HAVE IS. IF WE ARE GOING INTO A

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:08.168
ALL RICH ALL REGISTRANTS ARE

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:10.337
GETTING A BALLOT. OR WE'RE

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.805
EXPERTS I IMAGINE WE'RE GONNA

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.907
BE EXPECTING A HIGHER TURNOUT

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:17.778
BY VIRTUE OF THAT. DO YOU DO WE

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:19.012
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE CHATTING

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:22.049
WITH THE- COUNTY IS ON WHAT THE

01:40:22.116 --> 01:40:24.084
WOULD ANTICIPATE TO BE THE

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:25.986
INCREASED VOLUME OF VOTER

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:29.356
PARTICIPATION IN A GIVEN COUNTY

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.557
AND WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:32.826
IS I THINK THERE'S A COST HERE

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.963
THAT YOU WERE NOT POPULATING

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:39.800
OUT BECAUSE IF WE PRIEST. BUT

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.835
TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THIS NEW

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:43.570
POLICY. I'M WONDERING IF THERE

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:46.073
SHOULD BE. OPERATION ATTACHED

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:51.278
TO THIS NEW PROGRAM. BECAUSE I

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:52.446
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE KEY

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.314
KEY BECAUSE THE VOTING IS

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:56.283
SACROSANCT BUT- THE

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.185
TRUSTWORTHINESS OF VOTING I

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:01.155
THINK IS TERRIBLY IMPORTANT SO

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:03.757
MY OTHER QUESTION IS IT ONLY

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:05.426
THE SERIAL THAT IS MAILED BY

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.861
THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS TO THE

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:11.064
REGISTRANT. FIVE THAT ALLOWS

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:14.902
THE INDIVIDUAL TO- CAST A VOTE

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:16.937
FOR CAN SOMEONE GO TO A

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.907
COMPUTER PRINTOUT A BALLOT AND

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:22.943
USE THAT AS SOME FORM OF PROXY.

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:26.046
IS THAT I THINK IS GOES ALSO TO

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:27.714
THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT A

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:29.950
COUNTY REGISTRAR IS GOING TO

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:32.286
NEED A CLERK IS GOING TO NEED

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:35.422
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. EACH TOM

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:38.959
JONES OR TOM OR JONES OR TOM H.

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:41.962
R. JONES ANY NAME VARIATIONS

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:43.397
THAT WE HAVE IN THESE COUNTIES-

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:44.898
WERE INDIVIDUALS GET MULTIPLE

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.400
BALLOTS I THINK WE CAN ALL

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:48.402
ATTEST- THAT- SOME FOLKS

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:50.304
RECEIVE MULTIPLE BALLOTS BY

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:52.406
NAME VARIATION I THINK I'VE GOT

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:55.075

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:57.478
TIMES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SAME

01:41:57.544 --> 01:42:00.581
MAY FIRST MET AND NAME IN SAME

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:03.617
PER. IF THOUGH I'M NOT NINETY

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.687
YEARS. SO I THINK THERE'S AN

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:10.057
INNER FROM INNER SAFEGUARD THAT

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:11.024
I THINK WOULD BE HEALTH AND

LASTLY IS THAT SEVENTY DAISY

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.629

THEIR PAPER BALLOT BY ELECTION

01:42:25.506 --> 01:42:28.342

THIS SEVENTEEN DAY VISIT EXTEND

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:45.158
THE THIRTY DAY WINDOW THAT A-

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:47.895
THAT A COUNTY CLERK. USES JUST

01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:50.731
FINE ELECTION. DOES THAT CHANGE

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:53.734

DON'T KNOW I THINK THERE'S A

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:58.005
LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M HOPEFUL

01:42:58.071 --> 01:43:00.107
THAT THE SENATOR CAN ADDRESS

01:43:00.173 --> 01:43:01.642

FRAUD- YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG

01:43:13.287 --> 01:43:17.391
MANTRA BECAUSE- REALLY THE

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:19.393
EFFORT IS TO TRY TO SUPPRESS

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:22.829
THE VOTE. US LET'S BE. WE'RE

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:24.665

FEW CASES OF ACTUAL VOTER

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.937
FRAUD- I THINK STUDIES HAVE

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.172
SHOWN THAT SINCE THE YEAR TWO

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:34.908

WERE A TOTAL OF FIFTY SIX. THE

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:40.514
SIX CASES OF VOTER FRAUD AND

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:44.618
HOW MANY MILLIONS OF VOTES.

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:47.087
WERE CAST BUT IF THERE IS GREAT

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:51.425
CONCERN. ABOUT THE PENALTIES

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:54.394
FOR VOTER FRAUD. OUR COMMITTEE

01:43:54.461 --> 01:43:55.896

TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON IT IS

01:43:59.967 --> 01:44:02.903
A FELONY. TAMPERING WITH THE

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:06.373
VOTING SYSTEM. COULD GET YOU UP

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.008

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:18.151
LEADING A VOTER WHO NEEDS

VOTER FRAUD THEY FOUND EARLIER

WERE ACTUALLY COMMITTED BY

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:44.378
CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS AND NOT

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:48.015
VOTERS. SO THE FACT OF THE

01:44:48.081 --> 01:44:51.018
MATTER IS. THAT IN THE NATION

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:52.686
THE PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS

WHERE WE HAVE SANTA OTHERS TO

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.826

PERSON TO VOTE. WHO IS

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:10.737
QUALIFIED TO VOTE THEN WE

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:15.142
REALLY. DEMOCRATS GO AROUND THE

01:45:15.208 --> 01:45:18.512
WORLD WERE OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

IN GEORGIA. WHAT THERE ARE SOME

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:37.297
THAT WAS WHAT A DISGRACE TO OUR

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:40.333
DEMOCRATIC PULLS. WHY WHICH-

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.668
THAT IF IT TAKES DAYS. IT WILL

01:45:41.735 --> 01:45:42.803
ALLOW IT THERE'S A REQUEST

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:43.870
ABOUT THE BULLET OF A BALLOT IT

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:48.508
ALLOWS THE REGISTRAR TO DO THAT

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:50.677

THIS WILL. INCREASE THEIR

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:31.137

01:53:31.204 --> 01:53:32.472
THAT IT WILL RESULT IN THE BACK

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:33.740

ON THE ISSUE OUR FIRST OF ALL I

THINK THIS IS JUST A GOOD

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:59.465
COMMON SENSE MAY THE WILL ONLY

01:53:59.532 --> 01:54:01.701
KEEP TELL HEALTHY BUT TYPICALLY

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:04.070
IN I THINK THAT THE MARKET

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:05.838
WORKS ONLY WHEN EVERY SINGLE

01:54:05.905 --> 01:54:09.442
VOICES. WANTED TO SPEAK FOR THE

WHICH ARE AT ELECTION LOCALLY

ASIAN. COME FROM STRANGERS I

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:29.996
THINK THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:33.433
HEARD WAS NOT- BROUGHT IT WAS

01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:34.167
LITERALLY THROWING OUT

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:37.237
LEGITIMATE. VOTERS OUT BECAUSE

01:54:37.303 --> 01:54:39.973
THEIR SIGNATURES THAT IN MATCH

01:54:40.039 --> 01:54:41.140
AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT MY

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:43.176
COLLEAGUE SAID FROM- AND

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:46.713
VEHICLE. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:48.481
BLOOD VERY FULLY HOT. SO AGAIN

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:50.316
IT'S NOT AS THE A SELECT

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:51.684
BALLOTS THE SUBMITTING THEM

01:54:51.751 --> 01:54:53.953
THEY'RE STILL VERIFICATION.

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:58.224
THIS AND- THE BILL BONTA.

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.659
THROWING LEGITIMATE DOLLARS

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:00.627
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A

01:55:00.693 --> 01:55:03.162
SIGNATURE IS MAX SO THEN WE

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.030
WOULD BE ON THE UPPER TO

01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:05.565
AGAINST A META ON UPDATED

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:07.934
SIGNET BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:11.070
THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT-

01:55:11.137 --> 01:55:13.006
AT THE WILL. THE EIGHT. ARE TO

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:16.009

LINE FOR FOUR FIVE HOURS. THAT

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:26.619
IS REALLY NOT. THE GOAL I THINK

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:29.889
OF CALIFORNIA AT LEAST FOR

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:32.558

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:04.891
AND I THINK MAYBE IT SAYS I'VE

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:06.693
BEEN HOME ABOUT THREE MONTHS I

01:56:06.759 --> 01:56:09.329
THINK LIKE MOST OF YOU. AND

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:13.966
HAD. THE BEEN WATCHING. MANY

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:16.636
MORE MEDIA SOURCES THAN I HAD

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:18.971
LUXURY TO DO BEFORE. IN READING

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:22.141
MANY MORE FIVE REPORTS AND

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:25.078
EDITORIALS. AND I HAVE BEEN

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:28.748
APPALLED. AT THE EXPLICIT

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:33.519
STATEMENTS BY. REPUBLICANS IN

01:56:33.586 --> 01:56:36.055
OTHER PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY.

01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.291
THAT HAVE BASICALLY WHERE THEY

01:56:38.358 --> 01:56:41.661
EXPLICITLY STATED THAT THEIR

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:44.697
OPPOSITION TO VOTE BY MAIL

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:46.366
BALLOTS WAS BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:49.369
INCREASE TURNOUT AND THUS

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:50.803
POTENTIALLY THREATEN THEIR

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:54.607
ELECTORAL. CHANCES OUT I AM NOT

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:57.443
SAYING THAT MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.278
ON THIS FLOOR FEEL THAT WAY I'M

01:56:59.345 --> 01:57:02.615
JUST REPORTING. FACTUAL WHAT

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:06.753
WAS STATED IN HER. AND IT CALLS

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:10.623
ME. BUT THE LEAST THEIR UP

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:13.726
FRONT ABOUT THEIR REASONS SO

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:14.927
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VOTER

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:17.296
SUPPRESSION WE KNOW THAT IT IS

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:21.000
A PRESS BY MANY AS A FINE ART.

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:24.871
STRONG BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.606
WHILE WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THE

01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:29.308
PANDEMIC. AND YES IT'S VERY

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:30.777
IMPORTANT TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:33.112
OPTIONS TO NOT HAVE TO GO OUT

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.614
DURING A PANDEMIC WE SHOULD DO

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.950
VOTE BY MAIL REGARDLESS. AND

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:40.787
NOT ONLY THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE

01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:45.291
AUTOMATIC LITTER REGISTRATION.

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:48.895
IS NOT REQUIRED THAT'S NOT THE

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:49.762
SAME AS A FAILURE. WHERE TO

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:51.464
VOTE WHICH IS THE AUSTRALIAN

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:53.633
LAW. BUT THEY TURN EIGHTEEN IN
