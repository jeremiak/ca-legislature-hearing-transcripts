IT'S FILE NUMBER TWENTY NINE I'M GONNA HAND THEY GETOVER TO MR KILEY MY VICE CHAIR THAT IS NOW. THE CHAIR THERE WE GO MR KILEY. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU I MISTER BOND WHO'S GOING TO SENATE WITH ME AS WELL TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE REFORMS THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION APPEALS AND RENEWAL PROCESS. WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THIS IS A TOPIC OF MUCH DISCUSSION INSIDE THIS CAPITAL AND OUTSIDE THIS CAPITAL. IN FACT THERE ARE MANY RECENT AND NOT SO RECENT MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT THE NEED TO REFORM THE CURRENT PROCESS. NOT TO ELIMINATE IT BUT TO REFORM IT IN FACT THERE BEEN MANY MEDIA REPORTS HERE SOME HEADLINES RECENT. CALIFORNIA'S BROKEN CHARTER SCHOOL LAW HAS DEFIED REFORM. CAN NEWSOME BREAK THE GRIDLOCK. HOW A COUPLE WORK CHARTER SCHOOL REGULATIONS TO MAKE MILLIONS? SMALL DISTRICTS REAP BIG PROFITS BY APPROVING CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT. HOW A TINY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT SPARK CALLS FOR CHARTER CRACKDOWN? CELEBRITY CHARTER SCHOOL FOUNDER TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY CHARGES. PROSECUTORS SAID. AND THERE ARE MANY MORE. AGAIN RECENT ARTICLES IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DOCUMENT THE REASONS WHY IT IS TIME TO REFORM CHARTER SCHOOL OUT LAWS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND LET'S REMEMBER THERE ARE MORE CHARTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CLEARLY SOME BUT NOT ALL. CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKNESSES IN CURRENT LAW. WHICH IS LED TO PERSISTENT CORRUPTION AND DAMAGE TO OUR DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND ALL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CLEARLY WE NEED TO SHORE UP THIS LAW. THIS LAW DOES NOT GET RID OF CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT SHORES UP A LAW THAT AUTHORIZES AND OVER PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS -- LAWS ALLOW THOSE SEEKING TO OPEN A CHARTER SCHOL TO GO AUTHORIZED YOUR SHOPPING. SIMPLY PUT WAS AUTHORIZING SHOPPING ME. SIMPLY PUT THIS MEANS THAT AFTER BEING REJECTED BY ONE BOARD THEY CAN GO SEARCHING FOR AN OTHER BOARD FOR APPROVAL AND THIS IS OFTEN HAPPEN. WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM? THE DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER IS LOCATED NOT ONLY LOSES THEIR STUDENTS TO A SCHOOL THEY DID NOT BELIEVE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS. BUT MUST PROVIDE FACILITIES AND OTHERWISE A COMEDY THAT CHARTER IN THEIR OWN DISTRICT EVEN THOUGH THEY DID NOT APPROVE IT. FURTHER THE OVERSIGHT OF THAT CHARTER IS BY AN ENTITY THAT IS NOT LOCATED. IN THEIR DISTRICT AND IN FACT MAYBE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. THIS LACK OF OVERSIGHT CAN LEAD TO POOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND POOR STUDENT OUTCOMES AND IN FACT. HAS MANY TIMES ACROSS OUR STATE. OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND ADMINISTRATORS KNOW THEIR DISTRICTS AND THEIR STUDENTS BEST AND SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH CHARTERS CAN BEST SERVE THEIR STUDENTS THEIR LOCAL STUDENTS. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES RATHER THAN REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO APPROVE CHARTER PETITIONS. THIS GIVES LOCAL DISTRICTS THE SAME AUTHORITY THAT THEY ORIGINALLY HAD WHEN THE LAW WAS WRITTEN IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE MUST ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER ANY FISCAL ACADEMIC OR FACILITIES IMPACT A CHARTER SCHOOL MAY HAVE. A NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND ONCE CHARTERS ARE APPROVED THIS BILL REQUIRES AUTHORIZE RESTRICT SITTER THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL DURING RENEWAL. THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO A PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES AN EMERGENCY. WHEN I CHARTER SUDDENLY CLOSES OR SHUT DOWN IT IS DEVASTATING FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST PICK UP THE PIECES TO MAKE SURE? THOSE STUDENTS ARE SERVED EDUCATED. AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR IN SACRAMENTO A CRISIS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THIS DISTRICT HAD LOCAL CONTROL. THURMOND COLLEGIATE ACADEMY WAS INITIALLY DENIED BY SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND TONIGHT AGAIN BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. THE SCHOOL WAS APPROVED. BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. IT'S WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE SCHOOL WAS CLOSING ON THE VERY DAY IT CLOSED DUE TO FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. THIS SCHOOL CLOSURE LEFT STUDENTS STRANDED AND IT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN AVOIDED. APPROVED ON APPEAL. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY STORIES LIKE THIS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL REFORM THE APPEAL PROCESS SO THAT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. ARE NOT REPEATED. THIS BILL GIVES CHARTER AUTHORIZES THE TOOLS TO HOLD CHARTER SCHOOLS MORE ACCOUNTABLE. BY ALLOWING THE AUTHORIZED TO SHORTEN THE RENEWAL PERIOD. FOR STRUGGLING SCHOOLS. FURTHERMORE ANOTHER WAS RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S FIVE YEARS THEY CAN ACTUALLY. DESIGNATE A NUMBER UNDER THAT. OF COURSE BECAUSE FIVE IS JUST TOO LONG. WHEN THEY HAVE FISCAL PROBLEMS FURTHER TO ENSURE THAT CHARTER TEACHERS ARE QUALIFIED THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS MUST HOLD? THE REQUIRED CREDENTIAL FOR THEIR ASSIGNMENT. ALLOWING CHARTERS TO HIRE AND TRAIN TEACHERS ONLY HURTS STUDENTS. FINALLY. THE BILL ALLOWS CHARTERS TO RECEIVE VALUABLE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN A TIMELY MATTER AS CURRENTLY PROVIDED FOR OTHER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN CHARTERS ARE STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY? I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. THIS BILL CLOSE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS NO. THIS BILL WILL NOT SHUT DOWN EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS BILL MAY POTENTIALLY SLOW THE GROWTH OF NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS WHY BECAUSE SOME OF THE NEFARIOUS OPERATORS WILL RECEIVE MORE SCRUTINY AND POTENTIALLY. NOT BE APPROVED BUT IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE ANY SCHOOL. IF YOU'RE A GOOD CHARTER OPERATOR THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT IN THIS BILL AGAIN. IF YOU ARE A GOOD CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATOR THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL GRANDFATHERS IN ALL EXISTING CHARTERS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THERE ARE TWENTY NINE CHARTERS AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE BOARD THAT WILL NEED TO RETURN TO THE LOCAL DISK SCHOOL DISTRICT WHEN THEY ARE UP FOR RENEWAL. THIS WILL RETURN OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS THEY HAVE BEEN VERY LAX. WELL THIS BILL ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CLOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS AT RENEWAL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCIAL ACADEMIC OR FACILITIES IMPACT. THE INTENT IS TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER THE FISCAL IN THE FISCAL ACADEMIC AND FACILITIES IMPACT DURING THE REVIEW OF A PETITION FOR A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL OR FOR A SCHOOL. THAT IS EXPANDING ENROLLMENT. BUT NOT FOR EXISTING SCHOOLS I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THIS. AND WE ALL DRESSES AND FUTURE MOMENTS WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. NEXT HOW THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S TASK FORCE ON FISCAL IMPACT AND CHARTER AUTHORIZING IMPACT THE BILL. I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR IN SUPERINTENDENT FOR CLEARLY SIGNALING THAT MORE CHARTER REFORM IS NEEDED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TASK FORCE WHICH MAY HELP INFORM AND CHANGE THE BILL. THE LEGISLATURE IS A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND WE SHOULD IT TURMAN OUR PRIORITIES AND MOVE FORWARD WE SHOULD NOT KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD WE SHOULD ACT TODAY WE SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR A COMMITTEE THAT IS OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING. TO COME AND TELL US WHAT TO DO WHAT WE LISTEN TO THEM ABSOLUTELY WILL INCORPORATE SOME OTHER IDEAS I'M SURE WE WILL -- AND WITH THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA IT WAS ONE OF THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE BILL AND HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS FOLLOWED BY THREE WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR. WHICH IS APPROVED PRIOR TO THE HEARING OAKLAND UNIFIED BOARD PRESIDENT ANYTHING. SAN DIEGO UNIFIED A TRUSTEE RICHARD BARRERA AND REMOVE THE WORLD UNIFIED TRUSTEE CITY GARDENER SPEAKING ON BEHALF TO THE STANDARD YOU KNOW COUNTY OFFICE AND OTHER AREA DISTRICTS. MISTER CHAIR I TURN ABOUT YOU MISTER BONTA I THINK IT'S NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. ON AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT HAS. LARGELY BEEN UNTOUCHED SINCE IT WAS ENACTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY TWO CALIFORNIA NOW FINDS ITSELF FAR REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL MISSION AND VISION OF THE ACT WHICH WASN'T PART MEANT TO HELP GENERATE INNOVATION. TO BENEFIT STUDENTS IN ALL SCHOOLS. OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THE GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS STEADILY DRAINED MONEY AWAY. FROM TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AS A RESULT NUMEROUS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. IN MY OWN HOME DISTRICT. THEY TO THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS. OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE WITH NEARLY 30% OF STUDENTS ATTENDING CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN OPEN UNIFIED FACED A FISCAL SHORTFALL OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. OTHER DISTRICTS LIKE SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA AND INGLEWOOD. ALSO FACE SIMILAR FISCAL PRESSURES THESE DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE A LARGE CHARTER SCHOOL PRESENCE. SCHOOL GOVERNING BOARD TO MAKING CUTS IN STAFFING AND FACILITIES AS STUDENT ENROLLMENT DECLINES BUT DISTRICTS. ARE AT A BREAKING POINT. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO ENSURE THE FISCAL HEALTH. OF THEIR DISTRICT THAT IS THEIR MOST FUNDAMENTAL A CRITICAL ROLE MAKING SURE THEY HAVE A VIABLE FISCALLY SOUND SCHOOL DISTRICT. AB FIFTY NO FIVE WOULD AUTHORIZED LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO CONSIDER. HOW A PROPOSED CHARTER SCHOOL WHEN SEEKING ORIGINAL AUTHORIZATION COULD IMPACT A DISTRICTS FISCAL HEALTH? AS WELL AS HOW IT MAY IMPACT IT DISTRICTS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND FACILITIES. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF CHARTER AUTHORIZES THE WHOLE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR FISCAL MANAGEMENT. AB FIFTY NO FIVE WOULD PERMIT THE CONSIDERATION OF A CHARTER SCHOOLS FINANCIAL STABILITY. DURING THE RENEWAL PROCESS SO THAT A SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN IDENTIFY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO A PROBLEM. WITH ASSISTANCE BEFORE IT BECOMES. AN EMERGENCY. MOREOVER SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED PARTNERS IN INNOVATION NOT COMPETITORS. ALONG WITH THE OTHER GOALS OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT CARTER SCHOOLS ARE MEANT TO GENERATE INNOVATION. NOT PROVIDE DUPLICATION. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CHARTERS IN THEIR PETITION TO DESCRIBE WHY THEY'RE PROPOSED MODEL. COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN. THE EXISTING TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL STRUCTURE. LASTLY SCHOOL BOARDS ARE ELECTED BY AND ACCOUNTABLE. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ENTRUSTED TO MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF THE STUDENTS LIVING WITHIN THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE AUTHORIZED AND OVERSEEN. BY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT BEST UNDERSTAND THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL STUDENTS. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AB FIFTY NO FIVE WILL CREATE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND A STRONGER EMPHASIS ON EMPOWERING LOCAL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE WE HAVE WITNESSES HERE. STARTING WITH OAKLAND UNIFIED BOARD PRESIDENT. A MEETING. BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- MISSING. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS A MEETING PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE DIRECTLY SERVE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS VERY DISTRICT SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE FORTY FOUR CHARTER SCHOOLS OPERATING IN OAKLAND SERVING SIXTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. THIS MEANS THAT ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOW SERVING 27% OF OAKLAND'S PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS WHICH IS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. IN THIS RATIO IS EVEN HIGHER AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL WHERE OVER A THIRD 34% OF OUR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ARE NOW IN CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES ARE COMPLEX AND NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY STATE LAW IN ORDER TO BE BETTER ADDRESSED AND BEST ADDRESSED LOCALLY. FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT CURRENT APPEALS PROCESS HAD LIMITED THE DISTRICT'S OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY IN OUR ROADS OUR ABILITY TO PLAN FOR LONG TERM FISCAL HEALTH. OF OAKLAND'S FORTY FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS NINE ARE APPROVED BY THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION MANY AFTER INITIAL REJECTION BY THE LOCAL UST BOARD. AND ONE WAS APPROVED BY THE STATE LAST SUMMER AT THE SAME TIME THAT VIC MAC AND OTHER ENTITIES SUCH AS THE ALAMEDA COUNTY GRAND JURY. CRITICIZED OUR DISTRICT FOR OPERATING TOO MANY SCHOOLS IN ASKING US TO GET OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER. THERE IS A CLEAR FINANCIAL EDUCATIONAL IMPACT TO THE EXTENT CHARTER SCHOOLS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONCENTRATION OF OUR HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS INCLUDING LATE ARRIVING NEWCOMER AND SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS. AS A WHOLE OAKLAND CHARTER SCHOOLS SERVE. LAST SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND ALSO LESS. MODERATE TO SEVERE US STUDENTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE DISABILITIES. AS USTA'S OVER ALL STUDENT POPULATION DECREASES OUR PROPORTION OF STUDENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES IS INCREASING IN OUR DISTRICTS CONTRIBUTION TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES HAS INCREASED. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE LAST THREE YEARS TO NEARLY A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR GENERAL EDUCATION FUND. AND OUR POPULATION -- OUR SPECIAL JEKYLL EDUCATION POPULATION IS CONTINUING TO INCREASE. ONLY SIX OF THE THIRTY FOUR OPEN AUTHORIZED CHARTER SCHOOLS PARTICIPATE IN OUR O. U. S. D. SELVA. WHICH ALSO LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALES IN TERMS OF SERVING OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS EFFECTIVELY. FINALLY DISTRICTS US SUCH AS OAKLAND UP THAT ARE LARGE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME BEING NIMBLE ENOUGH TO WOULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ENROLLMENT LOSS. OR IN ROMAN LOSSES SPREAD ACROSS THE CITY'S EIGHTY SEVEN DISTRICT SCHOOLS MEANING IT'S DIFFICULT TO CUT STAFF FOR PROGRAMS TO ANYONE SCHOOL -- IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO MAKE FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS MERGERS CONSOLIDATIONS ENCLOSURES TO GET THE DISTRICT BACK ON SOLID FINANCIAL FOOTING. THE LAST TIME THE DISTRICT TRIED TO CLOSE SCHOOLS IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWELVE THEY TRY TO CLOSE FIVE SCHOOLS AND ONE OF THOSE SCHOOLS. CONVERTED TO A CHARTER SCHOOL AND WAS APPROVED TO THE COUNTY IN THE DISTRICT LOS THOSE STUDENTS. THE ABOVE CHALLENGES HAVE IS SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT WITH WHICH LEADS TO UNCERTAINTY AND ABILITY TO MAKE THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS IN IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR STUDENTS. WHICH LEADS -- TO AND WHICH ULTIMATELY HAS AN IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING. AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE MORE LOCAL CONTROL OVER AUTHORIZATION INTO MANAGE CHARTER GROWTH PARTICULARLY JUST TRICKS SUCH AS OURS WITH OUR HIGHEST RATIO OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. ON BEHALF OF OAKLAND WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AB FIFTY NO FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR STAYING WITHIN THE TWO MINUTES VERY CLOSE VERY GOOD. YOUR NEXT OUR NEXT WITNESS HI I'M RICHARD PERERA I'M WITH THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA WE SERVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS -- WITHIN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE -- FORTY SIX CHARTER SCHOOLS CURRENTLY OPERATING ARE ROUGHLY I CERTAINLY I SUPPORT OUTSIDE THE AYE ISSUES ARE REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT OAKLAND UNIFIED I JUST SPOKE TO AND AND WE'VE EXPERIENCED MANY OF THE SAME ISSUES AND SAN DIEGO BUT I I PARTICULARLY WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT LOCAL CONTROL. ASPECT OF THIS BILL -- WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS ELECTED OFFICIALS -- VERY SERIOUSLY WHEN A CHARTER PETITION COMES TO US OR WHEN A RENEWAL COMES TO US. I AND IN FACT WE I IN OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS. HI ON RENEWALS WE HAVE RENEWED FIFTY EIGHT PETITIONS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD TO OUR DISTRICT AND WE DID NIGHT THREE WE ARE HARDLY A DISTRICT THAT IS HOSTILE -- TO TO OUR EXISTING CHARTER COMMUNITY BUT WE DO HAVE AN EXAMPLE I'D THAT IS VERY CURRENT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HI FREDA I KNOW ABOUT IF YOU DON'T ALREADY. WE HAD A SCHOOL SEVERAL EITHER FIVE YEARS AGO THRIVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEY CAYMAN PETITION TO OUR DISTRICT. WE HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS IN THE PETITION ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THRIVE -- TO SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE A QUALITY EDUCATION PARTICULARLY HI TO YOU I STUDENTS -- FACING SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED ENGLISH LEARNERS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. I AND WE DENIED THAT PETITION AND AGAIN IT'S RARE I AND I'VE IT IS MY ELEVENTH YEAR ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IT'S RARE THAT WE DID NOT AND AND INITIAL PETITION BUT WE DENIED THAT. ONE THRIVE IN APPEAL TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION WHICH DENIED THE PETITION FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED. THRIVE AN APPEAL TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WAS GRANTED IT AYE AYE CHARTER. I AT THE TIME WAS GRANTED A CHARTER FOR AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TWICE APPROVED MATERIAL REVISIONS THAT ALLOWED THRIVE TO EXTEND TO A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. AND NOW HAS A THOUSAND STUDENTS. WHEN DR CAME TO US FOR RENEWAL WE SAW SOME OF THE WORST ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN IN A CHARTER PETITION WE DENIED THE STATE BOARD THEN DENIED THE RENEW ALL? AND NOW WE'RE IN A POSITION THAT WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS TO FIND PLACEMENTS FOR THEM I THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF OUR LOCALAUTHORITY THAT ARE EXPECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE ARE SUPPORT FOR THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M A GARDENER. IS -- IT IS ON GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CINDY GARDNER AND THE TRUSTEE VICE CHAIR FOR SAND DABS WHICH IS DECEMBER NINETEEN OH COUNTY DISTRICT ADVOCATES FOR BETTER SCHOOLS AND ON THE SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT PROGRAM IN THE WORLD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AT THE MARCH SAND DABS MEETING WE VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BELIEVING THAT CHARTER SCHOOL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN DECEMBER NINETEEN OH COUNTY HAVE GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CHARTERS OPERATING WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT BOUNDARIES WE ALL AGREED THAT THE DECISIONS REALLY NEAT NEED TO BE REMAINING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. INCLUDING IN THAT DISCUSSION WAS COUNTIES ASSEMBLY DINO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT TED ALL HUNDREDS. OF VOICE OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AGAIN AGREEING COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL OF US REPRESENTING THE COUNTY THAT THE DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WITH THE DATA THAT DISTRICTS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THE FACTORS OF FINANCE FACILITIES IN ACADEMICS. RAN FACE TO CHARTER SCHOOL PETITION WITH A MYRIAD OF RED FLAGS FOR A BOARD AND DISTRICT ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THIS ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM HAD CONTINUOUS BORDERS ALL THE WAY TO SAN DIEGO AND WE KNEW OUR SMALL DISTRICT STAFF COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY OVERSEE A MONITOR THIS ORGANIZATION. WE KNEW WORKING WITH OUR ATTORNEY ON THIS ISSUE WE COULD NOT INCLUDE ISSUES OF FACILITIES ALTHOUGH WE ONLY HAVE ONE HIGH SCHOOL WITH ONE FOR FOOTBALL FIELD ONE BASEBALL ONE STOP ALL. AND WE SHARE THESE FACILITIES WITH OUR YOUTH SPORTS PROGRAMS BECAUSE FLAT SPACE IS A PREMIUM ON THE MOUNTAIN AND WE'RE IN THE MOUNTAINS. SO A THIRD ENTITY CHALLENGING US FOR THESE FACILITIES WOULD BEEN HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC WE ALSO KNEW THAT WE COULD NOT INCLUDE THE ISSUES OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WE ARE DISTRICT WOULD FACE. IF THIS DISTRICT OPERATE WITHIN OUR BOUNDARIES BECAUSE WE ARE EXPERIENCING IT'S READ A 5% DECLINE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE ALSO ARE NOT THE WINNERS OF THE LCS THAT FORMULA. AND MOST OF THE HOMES IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAPPEN TO BE RESORT SECOND HOME OWNERS ONLY ABOUT OUR HOMES ARE ACTUALLY FAMILY SO WE HAVE A VERY -- TIGHT POPULATION WE KNEW WE WERE FACING ARREST TO DENY THIS CHARTER YET WE FELT BASED UPON THE PETITION DOCUMENT. THAT WE MADE THE BEST CHOICE FOR OUR SCHOOLS WHERE THE FIGHTING SCOTS EVERYBODY ON THE MOUNTAIN IS A FIGHTING SCOTT AND SAN BERNARDINO. ALSO BELIEVES THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES THANK YOU ARE WELL DONE I WILL HAVE ONE THAT'S ONE OF THE OPPOSITION OF THREE WITNESSES I BELIEVE THIS ROUTE IS A FOR THE OPPOSITION.

YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS HASTEN THOMAS I'M THE CEO OF EDUCATION FOR CHANGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS A CHARTER MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION THAT OPERATES SEVEN CHARTER PUBLIC SCHOOLS OAKLAND. SERVING OVER THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS 90% OF WHOM QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH I CAME TO THE CHARTER SECTOR AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS WITH AN OPEN UNIFIED TO SEE IF THE FLEXIBILITY IS EMBEDDED IN CHARTER LAW COULD FACILITATE XCELERATED. ACADEMIC GROWTH FOR HIGH POVERTY STUDENTS IN EAST OAKLAND. WHO HAVE BEEN VERY POORLY SERVED FOR DECADES? I AM DISMAYED BY THE DIVISION AND SCAPEGOATING THAT AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AS INVITED INTO AN OTHERWISE REASONABLE DEBATE ABOUT SUSTAINING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE RESEARCH BY GORDON LATE FOR THAT THE COMMITTEE IS RELYING ON LEX RIGOR AND BASIC REVIEW. THERE'S LITTLE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS OF THE CHIEF CAUSE OF DISTRICT FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND FAXES INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SKYROCKETING PENSION AND BENEFITS COSTS. WERE IDENTIFIED BY STANFORD RESEARCH. GETTING DOWN TO FAX IT TO REPORT AS THE MAIN DRIVERS OF DISTRICTS FILE JUST FISCAL DISTRESS AND FRANKLY CHARTER FISCAL DISTRESS. CHAIR O'DONNELL INDICATED THAT AB FIFTY NO FIVE GRANDFATHER'S EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS. ADD CODE FOUR SEVEN SIX OH SEVEN NAMES AT RENEWAL STANDARDS ARE GOVERNED BY CRITERION AT CODE FOUR SEVEN SIX OH FIVE WITH THIS LEGISLATION MODIFIES WHICH THIS LEGISLATION MODIFIES TO ALLOW DENIAL FOR NEGATIVE FINANCIAL ACADEMIC OR FACILITIES IMPACT. SO AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE STILL GRANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS EXPANSIVE DISCRETION TO CLOSE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS AND DENIES EXISTING SCHOOLS MEANINGFUL DUE PROCESS. TO OVERTURN DECISIONS THAT ARE ENTIRELY DIVORCED FROM THE EDUCATIONAL VALUES THE CHARTERS ARE PROVIDING FOR MRS MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. STANFORD'S REPORTER FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN DISTRICT SCHOOLS IN URBAN AREAS AND FOR TRADITIONALLY LOWER PERFORMING STUDENT GROUPS. ISN'T THIS THE PRIORITY OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM TO SERVE THE CHILDREN AND NOT THE INSTITUTION. AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE IT'S TO STARTING SCHOOL SYSTEMS AGAINST EACH OTHER HOLD ON HOLD ON WE CAN'T HAVE OUTBURSTS LIKE THAT. IN THIS ROOM HEY. EVERYBODY GETS A CHANCE TO BE HEARD BY THE A LIKE IT OR YOU DON'T THAT'S HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS OKAY AND WE'RE GONNA WORK RIGHT NOW SO PLEASE PROCEED. AB FIFTY NO FIVE PITS TO STARVING SCHOOL SYSTEMS AGAINST EACH OTHER DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENT A SCARCITY THAT WILL TO LOOK DOUBLE DEBILITATE ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE LONG TERM. I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR BRINGING A GROUP OF DIVERS PRACTITIONERS TOGETHER TO RECOMMEND REVISIONS I AM NOT OPPOSED REVISIONS TO CHARTER LAW. I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT PRACTITIONER VOICE THE VOICES OF PEOPLE ON THE GROUND DOING THE WORK MUST INFORM THE REVISIONS THAT WILL HAVE A VERY REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF POTENTIAL CHILDREN. IN HUNT THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL CHILDREN AND HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT. HI MY NAME IS LET THE GOMEZ AND I HAVE THREE CHILDREN ONE OF WHICH HAS A LEARNING DISABILITY I AM ALSO A PROUD FOUNDING PARENT OF A HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL IN EAST SAN JOSE WERE MY YOUNGEST CHILD ATTENDS. HERE'S MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER WITH ME G. ANA WE ARE HERE TODAY TO OPPOSE AB FIFTY NO. FIVE I NEIGHBORHOOD TRADITIONAL DISTRICT SCHOOL IS A K. THROUGH EIGHT SCHOOL AND ONLY 16% OF STUDENTS ARE PROFICIENT IN MATH AND 21% ARE PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH. I MY DAUGHTER'S CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE SAME COMMUNITY 57% OF STUDENTS ARE PROFICIENT IN MATH AND 56% ARE PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA. WHO IS MY REPRESENTATIVE EIGHTY TWENTY SEVEN HAS COLD WATER THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH IN HIS DISTRICT FIFTY FIVE POINT 8% OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY? COMPARED TO ONLY TWENTY NINE POINT 5% OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND DISTRICT SCHOOLS MY DAUGHTER'S CHARTER SCHOOL IS THE TOP PERFORMING SCHOOL IN ALUM ROCK DISTRICT. YET THIS BILL WILL GIVE POWER TO LOCAL DISTRICT TO DENY RENEWALS BASED ON FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THEIR DISTRICT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT ACADEMIC RESULTS. GIVEN FINANCIAL POWER BACK TO ALUM ROCK IS AN INJUSTICE TO OUR COMMUNITY WHEN THE RECENT GRAND JURY. REPORT FOUND THAT THEY WERE MISS MANAGING TAXPAYERS DOLLARS THIS BILL IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY OUR COMMUNITY RIGHT. OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THE RIGHT TO SCHOOL CHOICE. AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY I CAN NOT AFFORD PRIVATE SCHOOL FOR MY DAUGHTER AND WITH THE CURRENT COST OF LIVING I CANNOT AFFORD TO MOVE TO IN ORDER TO FIND A SCHOOL THAT BEST SUPPORTER. I WILL BE LEFT WITH THE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL IN THE EAST SIDE OF SAN JOSE. WHY ISN'T ANYONE TALKING ABOUT FIXING FAILING SCHOOLS I HAVE BEEN WAITING OVER THIRTY YEARS FOR OUR PART EDUCATION SYSTEM TO IMPROVE I CAN NOT CONTINUE TO WAIT AT THE EXPENSE OF MY DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION? WE DESERVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION OPTIONS THAT OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT ALLOW WE ARE DIFFICULT TO DEFINE OUR CHILD OUT CUP WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER FOR ALL STUDENTS.

GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DAVE GORDON I WORK IS THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND TODAY I'M REPRESENTING OUR COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR SACRAMENTO. WE HAVE THREE REASONS OUR BORDERS THREE REASONS FOR OPPOSING THIS BILL NUMBER. ONE ELIMINATES THE COUNTY BOARDS OPPORTUNITY TO APPROVE COUNTY WIDE CHARTERS GOING FORWARD. OUR BOARD CERTAINLY HASN'T ABUSE THAT PRIVILEGE AND FOURTEEN YEARS. THEY'VE ONLY APPROVED ONE COUNTY WIDE CHARTER. THE FORTUNE CHARTER SCHOOL WHICH IS BEEN OPERATING FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS NOW AND WAS. INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST PLACE TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND IN FACT. THE SCHOOL HAS OVER TWELVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AT SIX LOCATIONS NOW. AND IS DOING EXACTLY THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FOURTEEN SCHOOL. SECONDLY THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE CHARTER APPEAL PROCESS. FOR EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH THE BOARD FEELS. IS NECESSARY IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO HAVE SOME -- REDRESS IF UP IF THE PETITION IS TURNED DOWN AND AGAIN THE PROCESS HASN'T BEEN ABUSED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. THERE HAVE BEEN THIRTEEN APPEALS -- NONE OF WHICH WAS APPROVED AND IN FACT ONE OF THE ONES WAS THE ONE THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED THAT EVENTUALLY WENT TO THE STATE BOARD. AND WAS APPROVED IT HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD. AND FINALLY OUR BOARD BELIEVES A. B. FIFTEEN FIVE FIFTEEN OH FIVE IS PREMATURE AGAIN.

OFFER I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME ON THE END OF THE TABLE AND I DIDN'T. KNOW MY NAME IS HASTEN THOMAS FROM -- EDUCATION FOR CHANGE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA OKAY IT IS A ONE POINT YOU MADE ACT. I TWENTY SURE YOU YOU HAD A CONCERN ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT THAT WOULD ONLY BE GOING FORWARD. WE SEEK TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS AT CLARIFY THAT I SPOKE TO THAT WHEN I OPENED UP TODAY. WITH REGARD TO THE FISCAL IMPACT OF CHARGES THAT WOULD ONLY BE A NEW CHARGE GOING FOR SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. OKAY AND THOSE WHO YOU SPOKE ABOUT. MISTER MISTER CHAIR CAN I ASK. ALRIGHT LET ME JUST. NINETY BUT WHEN YOU ASK IS A PERK PERTAINS WHAT I JUST BROUGHT UP OKAY GOT. BOB SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE BILL IMPRINT TODAY -- IS NOT -- EIGHT THE BILL IN PRINT TODAY IS WHAT WE'RE REFERRING TO THE CROSS REFERENCE WHICH WOULD APPLY TO RENEWAL STANDARDS AND WOULD APPLY TO EXISTING SCHOOL SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THIS. YEAH YEAH SO MEMBERS WE PLAN TO TAKE. NOT THE CURRENT FORM. OKAY BILL FOR THEIR NOT REFLECT IN THE BILL. OKAY THAT'S WHAT I'M STATING YES I'M SORRY I THOUGHT OF YOU THE CLIP. OKAY THEN AGAIN -- I I JUST HAD A QUESTION TALK ABOUT FISCAL IMPACT YOU TALK ABOUT DISTRICTS. MAYBE THE WAY SOUND MAY WORK THE COMMENTATOR TAKE TEACHERS TOO MUCH. YOU TALKED ABOUT PENSIONS AND YOU TALK ABOUT BENEFITS AND PAY WAS IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA PAY TOO MUCH. NO MY POSITION WOULD BE THE OPPOSITE AND WE COME FROM OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WERE SKYROCKETING COST OF LIVING IS MAKING IT SUCH THAT WHETHER YOU'RE IN A DISTRICT A CHARTER PUBLIC SCHOOL OUR ABILITY TO PAY TEACHERS TO EVEN PAY RENT -- AND SURVIVE IS INADEQUATE SO I THINK I WAS REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT -- IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ARE THE ART. SCHOOL OPERATORS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE INCREASING AMOUNTS TO THE PENSION FUNDS WHICH HAVE MADE IT SO THAT WHILE L. L. C. AT THAT HAS GONE UP OUR EXPENSES OF ALSO GOING UP DRAMATICALLY IN AT THIS POINT. THE INCREASES IN LCF ARE NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THE INCREASES IN PENSIONS AND BENEFITS INCREASES OKAY AND I AGREE WITH AND THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A CHARTER SCHOOL OR TRADITIONAL. SCRAP PROBLEM THAT'S A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO DRESS FOR ALL STICKER ACT IN EVERY SCHOOL SO I APPRECIATE THAT POINT OF VIEW. AND I AGAIN I JUST I EITHER A LOT OF FOLKS WHO CAME UP WITH THINK FROM THE HOME SCHOOL COMMUNITY I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY FEEL MORE TARGETED THAN ANY OTHER IN THIS EFFORT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE EFFORT HERE. AND I I JUST WANT UNDERLYING THAT IF YOU'RE CHARTER SCHOOL AS WELL OPERATED TODAY. THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEAK YOUR SCHOOL. THIS BILL SPEAKS TO THOSE SCHOOLS WHO ARE NOT OPERATED WELL THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL OKAY SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. AND ALL MR MCCARTY YOU SEE SHE IN HER DO WISH [inaudible] TO THANK YOU -- MAYBE I CAN JUST ASK YOU MISTER BONTA OR THAT THE CHAIR IS A JOINT AUTHORED JUST TO CLARIFY ONE MORE TIME. BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU ASK THE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HERE TODAY WHATEVER THE WHATEVER NUMBER THERE ARE THIS BOOK CAN OPPOSITION. THEY WOULD SAY TWO THINGS. THEY LOVE THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY EITHER HALFORD HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN. HEY THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION. AND FRANKLY DISINFORMATION ABOUT. THIS AND THE AND THE NEXT BILL WHICH WILL GET TO A LITTLE BIT SO COULD YOU CLARIFY. FOR THE RECORD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO CURRENT. OPERATORS. WHETHER THE GRANDFATHER GRANDMOTHER CLAUSE WHEN THEY PETITION FOR RENO. YES IN SHORT THIS THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO CLOSE ANY CURRENTLY EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS [inaudible] THE IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE A DRAFTING ERROR. THAT HAS CREATED SOME CONFUSION IT'S IT IS IN THE CURRENT FORM OF THE BILL WHAT YOU'RE READING YOUR READING IT RIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO IT WILL BE A CHANGE SO THAT. THE CONSIDERATION OF FINANCIAL IMPACT THE CONSIDERATION OF ACADEMIC IMPACT THE CONSIDERATION OF FACILITIES IMPACT WILL ONLY APPLY. TO INITIAL AUTHORIZATION. NOT. NOT. TO RENEW OFFICE AND YOUR GRANDFATHER NANOGRAM MOTHER DâN. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE BUT OFF REPEATED -- IF -- IF YOU'RE HAVE ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZING YOU SEE CAN WE AUTHORIZATION YOU GO BACK TO THE AUTHORIZED FOR THAT AUTHORIZE YOU -- WITH ONE EXCEPTION BUT BUT IF YOU GOT A AUTHORIZATION FROM A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE YOU GO BACK FOR FOR RE AUTHORIZATION. FOR WE KNOW IF YOU GOT AUTHORIZED BY COUNTY. HE GO BACK TO THE COUNTY. BUT IF YOU'RE AUTHORIZED BY THE STATE WE ASK NOW WITH THIS BILL THAT YOU GO. BACK TO THE LOCAL DISTRICT THAT'S THE ONE EXCEPTION. SOMEONE JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT -- SO THAT WE MY IMPRESSION WAS MUCH THE SAME AS YOURS MISTER MCCARTY -- AND I FIRST WANT TO THANK INCREDIBLE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT FROM -- FOLKS MALL OVER THE STATE MANY -- I NOTICED A FROM MY DISTRICT THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING IF YOU CAME FROM MY DISTRICT -- THE YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULAR WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO FOR BEING HERE FOR EXPRESSING YOUR VIEW FOR ENGAGING. AND OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS -- BUT MY SENSE WAS. THAT FOLKS LOVE THEIR CURRENT CHARTER SCHOOL. AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE CLOSE BY THIS BILL. AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION NOR DO WE THINK IT WILL BE THE IMPACT AT ALL. OF OF THIS BILL THIS IS ABOUT NEW APPLICATIONS -- AUTHORIZATIONS GUY GOING FORWARD WHERE I CHARGE BUT NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED BEFORE SO THERE'S NO. KIDS ARE STUDENTS GOING TO IT YET IT DOESN'T EXIST. AND THEY'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING. SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY CONSIDER FOR OTHER ISSUES. LIKE THE FISCAL IMPACT OF PENSIONS THE FISCAL IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE THE FISCAL IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCES WERE GONNA ASK THAT THEY ALSO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER AS ONE FACTOR AMONG MANY. THE FISCAL IMPACT OF ON A DISTRICT OF A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S BEING ASKED WE AUTHORIZE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. SO I HOPE THAT CLARIFIES THINGS FOR SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE -- AND MAKES THEM FEEL A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT THEIR EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOL AND MISTER MCCARTY IF I COULD THERE'S ALREADY PROCESS FOR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AB TWELVE HUNDRED I BELIEVE IT IS THERE'S A PROCESS WHERE AND THEY FILED THE COUNTY AND THERE FISCAL SITUATION LOOKED AT THREE YEARS OUT AND ALSO SEE NEW SIMPLY. IS DEPRIVE BASICALLY THE SAME STANDARD TO CHARTER SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY WHEN THERE ARE FISCAL PROBLEMS MUCH EARLIER. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN FAULT US FOR DOING THAT THAT'S JUST WISE POLICY SO THAT IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS WE CAN GET INTO THE CHART OF THE COUNTY MEMBER THEY NEED HELP FROM. CAN GET IN THERE I AND HELP ADDRESS THE FISCAL PROBLEMS ON IT -- IT EARLY ON SO THEY DON'T RESULT IN A DAY OF APPARENTLY THE DAY HAVE A SCHOOLS CLOSING THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THEN FIND A SPOT FOR THEIR STUDENT IN IN IN. IN ANOTHER SCHOOL IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL LOCAL TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL HAS TO PICK THAT STUDENT UP IN A VERY IMMEDIATE BASIS AND THAT CAUSES ALL KINDS OF LOGISTICAL ISSUES. SO AGAIN THIS IS IT WE SEEK EARLY WARNING. TO HELP NOT TO HURT YEAH. THANK YOU AND AND MY NEXT QUESTION CAN I ASK MY LOCAL COUNTY SUPERLATIVE SCHOOLS MISTER GARDEN -- TO TO TO COME BACK IF YOU MAY FOR SECOND. YEAH AND WHILE HE'S HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT -- MISTER BONTA I WILL SAY JUST LIKE YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE KNOW GOOD CHARTER OPERATORS AREN'T IN OUR COMMUNITIES I HEARD. HERE FROM TODAY AND A BUNCH OF MY AREA THAT THE HIGHLANDS CHARTER PROGRAM WHICH IS THE FOCUS IS PROBABLY AN ADULT ADULT EDUCATION. ADULT LEARNERS ARE FORTUNE SCHOOL OF COURSE ARE HEARD FOR THE LANGUAGE TO CARRY A SACK SACRAMENTO SO. I KNOW INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE SO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY'RE NOT GOING AWAY. I WILL I WANT TO I WANT TO ASK YOU MISTER GORE YOU FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU ARE ARE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. AND YOU'RE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION -- TO THIS BILL -- ON BEHALF OF YOUR BOARD YOU SAID RIGHT SO SO YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT HERE AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS A SUPER TEN YOU'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF YOUR BOARD. CORRECT. YEAH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY BOARD TRYING TO REFLECT THE EXPERIENCE. THAT I AND MY BOARD HAVE HAD OVER THE YEARS. WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE. OF THE ED COALITION. WE HEARD FROM -- THREE GROUPS OF MY SENDING EARLIER THAT ARE TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. AND THERE'S THREE OTHERS FROM THE MANAGEMENT SIDE THE SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION CSPA BACKS -- WHO UP SOMEWHAT SUPPORTIVE AMENDED IN YOUR ORGANIZATION SUCCESS AT? WHICH IS COMMUNICATED TO OUR STAFF THAT THEY ARE ALSO. SUPPORT FOR MINUTES SO IT SENDS A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION THAT YOU'RE HERE. OPPOSING THE BILL. WHEN YOUR ORGANIZATION WHICH YOU'RE A PROUD MEMBER OF IS WALKING AROUND THE SAME ALL SAYING THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT WITH THAT TECHNICAL AMENDMENT? THAT CREATES A PROBLEM MISTER GORE'S LE LET ME TRY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THAT BECAUSE AS I SAID I THINK YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW. THAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS IS PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE. THE RECORD OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH MY COUNTY BOARD. AND THE MANAGEMENT OF OF CHARTERS. AND I THINK OUR OUR BOARD OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN VERY PRUDENT. IN LOOKING AT CHARTERS THEY HAVE NOT -- APPROVED WEEK CHARTERS THIS AS I MENTION THE ONLY COUNTY WIDE CHARTER THAT. THE BOARD HAS APPROVED AS THE FORTUNE CHARTER WHICH WHICH I THINK IS IS KNOWN PRETTY WELL. AS A HIGH PERFORMING CHARTERS SO THAT'S OUR EXPERIENCE WITH CHARTERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED TO REFLECT TO TO THE COMMITTEE AS YOU DELIBERATE. ON WHERE THE SKULLS. OKAY I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THE DID YOU KNOW YOU WORK WITH ALSO WITH THE ASSOCIATION. THEY'RE BRINGING US INFORMATION ABOUT -- SUPPORTING THE BILL WITH A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT AND SO I THINK THAT GOD AND ASK YOU CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU COMMUNICATE THAT WITH US AS WELL YEAH YOUR EYES SHALL AND AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HAVE A MEMBER ON THE GOVERNOR'S -- APPOINTED COMMITTEE -- UP. THE HEAD OF OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT ASSOCIATION -- ADVANCE. AND AND WE'RE LOOKING TO TO HIM TO HAVE -- INPUT AN INFLUENCE ON THAT PROCESS SO THANK YOU. YES AND AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FEW BILLS I WON'T GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES BUT IT'S BUT I KNOW SACRAMENTO IS IS ROUGHLY 1012% CHARTER POPULATION SIMILAR TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD. THIS LAW ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE EARLY NINETIES FARCE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE. LABORATORIES FOR LEARNING WHEN THEY FIRST CAME ABOUT TEN IT'S EVOLVED AND IT IS WHAT IT IS AND SO I THINK. THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FISCAL REALITIES OF OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND NEEDED AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THIS MISSION THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY HOPE. MISS SMITH. I LIKE TO THINK MY CO AUTHOR ON THIS MISTER BONTA AND I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENT. ABOUT PARTNERS IN INNOVATION AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY AND I'VE HAD SOME ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS HAVING SPENT. TIME AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NINE YEARS AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER IS THAT WE HAVE LOST SIGHT. OF THE INNOVATION FEEDBACK LOOP THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED IN OUR NATION AND OUR STATE'S CHARTER MOVEMENT. AND SO IF YOU COULD THOSE OF YOU IN OPPOSITION SPEAK TO KIND OF WHAT THAT INNOVATION FEEDBACK LOOP LOOKS LIKE IN THE DISTRICT THAT YOU CURRENTLY SERVE. AND IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON ANY CHANGES GOING FORWARD TO HELP ENHANCE THAT PROCESS. I'M SORRY JUST TO CLARIFY SO THE CHARTER SECTOR IN OAKLAND IS ACTUALLY IN PRETTY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH DISTRICT LEADERSHIP -- WE MEET REGULARLY WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT HER STAFF TO THINK ABOUT THE LARGER PORTFOLIO OF SCHOOLS I AM THE FOUNDER AND A PARENT URBAN MONTESSORI CHARTER SCHOOL THE ONLY PUBLIC MONTESSORI OPTION IN OAKLAND. WORKING ACTUALLY WE RAISE MONEY TO HAVE A STAFF PERSONWHO IS ACTUALLY WORKING ACROSS DISTRICT IN CHARTER SCHOOL TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE MONTESSORI PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMMING AND U. S. D.. I I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ACTUALLY WE'RE PART OF WE PARTNER WITH -- SIX ACTUALLY -- THIRTEEN LOWER ELEMENTARY PROGRAMS OPEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS PART OF AN EARLY LITERACY INITIATIVE FUNDED BY THE KENNETH RENDON FOUNDATION CHARTER DISTRICT ALIKE WE EDUCATION FOR CHANGER IN PARTNERSHIP WITH -- UST AROUND CREATING A SPECIAL EDUCATION RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND ACTUALLY GOT STATE FUNDING TOWARDS THAT THIS THIS SCHOOL YEAR. THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE DISTRICT CHARTER DIVIDE THAT IS SORT OF PERPETUATED IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE IN OAKLAND THERE'S RHETORIC AND THERE'S REALITY. AND I THINK THERE IS MUCH INTEREST IN WORKING ACROSS -- I OPENED AT THE CONTROVERSIAL LATITUDE HIGH SCHOOL THAT WENT TO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IT IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS IMAGINABLE WHICH IS WHY I PUT SO MUCH ENERGY AND OPENING IT. WE'RE THEIR CREDIT A COMPETENCY BASED HIGH SCHOOL MODEL VERY INVEST IN WORKING WITH THE ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS OAKLAND SO WE CAN GET RID OF THINGS LIKE CONTINUATION HIGH SCHOOLS AND ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOLS AND MOVE TOWARDS. IF YOU HAVE A COMPETENCY BASED SYSTEM ALL KIDS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE UNDER CREDITED SIXTEEN CAN ACTUALLY ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL AND WORKED QUICKLY OR OR THROUGH SUMMERS ARE EVENINGS TO ACQUIRE THE COMPANY SEES TO GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF INNOVATIONS WERE LOOKING. FOR AND SPEAKING OF INNOVATION I THINK WHAT'S TRICKY FOR ME ABOUT THE WORD INNOVATION BECAUSE MY CHARTER NO HE'S NOT PARTICULARLY INNOVATIVE. BUT I WILL SAY THIS IN FACT ART MY TURN OVER HE'S ACTUALLY COMPRISED ALMOST ENTIRELY A FORMER -- UST SCHOOLS THAT CONVERTED TO CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR VARIOUS SINCE OVER THE YEARS. AND I WILL SAY THIS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OAKLAND NEEDS FOR INNOVATION IS. BETTER PERFORMANCE FOR BLACK AND BROWN KIDS IF THAT'S NOT INNOVATIVE IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING INTO IT FIFTY SIXTY YEARS OF UNDER PERFORMANCE. FOR BLACK AND BROWN KIDS IN THE DEFAULT PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT'S THE STATUS QUO AND SO IT IS DISRUPTIVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE HIGH PERFORMING BLACK AND BROWN KIDS IN OAKLAND BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND I UNDERSTAND HERS AREN'T ALWAYS THE ANSWER IN FACT THERE ARE BAD PLAYERS AND WE ARE VERY OPEN TO GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG AUTHORIZED AN OPEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY ARE TOUGH AUTHORIZED -- ARE COUNTIES A TOUGH AUTHORIZED -- AUTHORIZING PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN ACCOUNTABILITY -- IT'S A TOUGH PLACE TO RUN A CHARTER SCHOOL IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PLAYER. AND I WILL SAY THIS I THINK THE CLOSING DOORS TO POTENTIALLY INCREASING OUTCOMES FOR KIDS WE'VE NOT SEEN OUTCOMES FOR DECADES WORRIES ME IT MIGHT NOT BE INNOVATIVE IN IN TERMS OF LIKE ENGINEERING OR STEM. BUT IT'S AND IT'S TRULY INNOVATE IN TERMS OF LIKE KIDS AND AND COMMUNITIES IN OAKLYN ARE EXPERIENCING. I WOULD ONLY THANK YOU NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. I WOULD ONLY GOT A GAME -- DO WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER. IN OTHER NO AND CONNECT YOU REMEMBER WHICH IS [inaudible] NUMBER OKAY. NO ONE DOWN THERE MISS SMITH. IS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO I pREMARKS. AND HERE'S MY THOUGHT WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I LIKE AS I JUST SAID I CAME OF NINE YEARS AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. I ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE DISTRICTS THE COMMUNITIES THAT I SERVE WE HAVE SOME HIGHLY EFFECTIVE CHARTERS I'M THE HOME TO THE GRANADA HILLS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL MULTIPLE TIME WINNER OF THE STATE'S ACADEMIC DECATHLON. I REPRESENT AND I LEAD AS HE AYE AYE LEAD SCHOOLS SELF DIRECTED LEARNING FOR STUDENTS -- A NUMBER THAT ARE CHARTER THROUGH OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN SERVING STUDENTS WITH VERY DIVERSIFIED BUT SPECIFIC NEEDS. AND SO MY HOPE AS SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN A GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER AND WHO KNOWS THE SIGNIFICANCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP IN ESTABLISHING WHAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT INTENDED. WHICH WAS DRIVING INNOVATION. ELIMINATING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND FOCUSING ON STUDENT SUCCESS THAT THE CLOSER THAT RELATIONSHIP IS AND THE MORE THAT WE TAKE OUT THE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF APPROVAL LIKE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT REALLY HAS NO RELATIONSHIP TO THAT LOCAL DYNAMIC. THE BETTER OFF STUDENT SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE ACROSS THE BOARD. SO I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE WORK THAT WE MAY DO AFTER THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE IS DONE AND WRAPS UP AND GIVES US A REPORT ON WHAT THEY THINK MIGHT FURTHER IMPROVE THIS RELATIONSHIP. BUT I THINK I'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR WITH EVERYBODY ALL ALONG FROM MY OWNCOMMUNITY TO THE FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS GETTING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND I WANT EVERYBODY OUT OF THEIR SILOS AND TO STOP THROWING BOMBS FROM OTHER SIDES OF THE AISLE AND FOCUS ON WHAT THAT MEANINGFUL WORK IS ABOUT. REGARDLESS OF THE KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL AND THE KIND OF PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT THEY ARE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS TO SPEAK DOCTOR WEBER GOING. YES OF I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK -- MY COLLEAGUES WHO. BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I REALIZE IT. IS THAT YOUR HEART IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S A PART OF IT ANY MALICIOUS OR PLATEN PLAN AGAINST I HOPE NOT AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I I JUDGE EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN -- ON ITS MERIT IN WHERE THE NOT IT'S BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN. AND CLEARLY IT BRINGS ME GREAT CONCERN TO SEE THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HERE TALKING ABOUT WANTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN -- ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW. GENERALLY HAPPENS IN MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH REGARDS TO BLACK AND BROWN KIDS WILL POUR -- HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED ANDAND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE CRITICAL QUESTION IS NOT BEING ASKING IS WHAT IS BEST FOR CHILDREN. I THINK WE CAN IDENTIFY THE ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE CREATED FOR OURSELVES -- THE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE SOME VALIDITY -- I AM CONCERNED AND I EXPRESSED TO SOME OF THE AUTHORS OF THAT -- I'M THAT PRETTY MUCH THIS THIS THIS DISCUSSION TODAY IS A DONE DEAL BECAUSE FOUR OF THE SIX MEMBERS ON THIS. ON THE DAY AS OUR CO AUTHORS OF OF THIS BILL SELF OF THIS BILL AND ALL THE OTHER CHARTER BILL SELF. BUT IT'S GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU ANYWAY SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF ROOM FOR PERSUASION BUT SIMPLY LET ME SAY THAT -- I AM CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR. AND THE SUPERINTENDENT HAVE FORMED A TASK FORCE. WHOSE TASK IS TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT AUTHORIZATION. YOU WHERE SHOULD BE HOPEFULLY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT SHOULD BE IN THERE AND EVEN NOW MORE RECENTLY THE IMPACT ECONOMICS HAS ON THE CHART OF SYSTEM -- I JUST LOOKED AT AND OF A LETTER FROM THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT THE MEETINGS A PAD AND THE GOAL THAT THEY HAVE TO RELEASE THE REPORT BY JULY. ONE SO I'M CONCERNED THAT I DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION. NOT UNBIASED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DO AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON OUR SCHOOLS. NOW IS NO QUESTION THAT AFTER TWENTY SIX YEARS -- THERE'S A NEED FOR A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT CHARTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND OVERSIGHT OF CHARTERS -- AND WHAT IS REASONABLE FOR A DISTRICT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF CHARTERS IS REASONABLE FOR DISTRICT THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MANAGE AND SUPERVISE. THE WHAT WE'RE GETTING READY TO DO WITH THAT AND SOME OTHER BILLS WOULD WITH TAX AND THIS AND THIS DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT. BECAUSE OF OAKLAND IS ONE THIRD CHARTER IS THAT A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE FOR THE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT DISTRICT ACTUALLY SUPERVISE THAT NUMBER SINCE YOU'RE CAPPING IT AT THAT THOUGH STILL BE A 30%. AND SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES IS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY THAT WE HAVE FOR CHART IS NOT ONLY TO BE OPERATED BY A BOARD THAT HAS GOOD OVERSIGHT IS THAT ENOUGH. AND WHAT IMPACT DOES THAT HAVE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OVERSIGHT AND WE SEEN THAT IN OTHER PLACES WHAT HAPPENS TO BOARDS THAT ARE BAD ACTORS. WHO ACTUALLY MAKE LOTS OF CHARTERS AND DO NO OVERSIGHT YOU KNOW DO WE TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT TO CHART I MEAN I THINK THERE'S SOME REALLY SERIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK THIS NOT? BEING ASKED AND SERVE OTHER LEGISLATION THAT WE SEE THIS COMING FOR I'VE HEARD THE RUMORS I KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY I'VE LOOKED AT IT. AND THEN I KNOW THE TRANSPARENCY POLICE IS GOOD AND WE WE BOTH GREASE FOLKS GREAT TO THAT. BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THAT THE REAL ISSUES AFFECTING CHARTERS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN THE STATE ARE NOT REALLY BEING ANSWER. NOW MY YOU KNOW MY INVOLVEMENT WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS WAY BACK PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS ROLE. BECAUSE I WAS CHAIR OF THE NO ONE ONE SEVENTY FOUR CAMPAIGN IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE I WAS CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND I'VE FOUGHT AGAINST VOUCHERS. AND I KNOW THAT A PART OF THE NEGOTIATION OUT OF THAT CAME CHARTER. WHICH IS FINE AND AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF SHARING INFORMATION AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND WE'VE GONE COMPLETELY IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION IT SEEMS AS IF THE YOU KNOW THAT MOST OF THE CONVERSATION HAS NOT BEEN. FRIENDLY SUPPORTIVE CONVERSATIONS EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL BOARDS AND A SAN DIEGO SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WITH CHARTERS. AND HAS DONE SOME GOOD WORK WITH CHARTERS AND AND AUTHORIZES REASONABLE CHARTERS BUT I KNOW THAT RUMORS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND YET I DON'T REALLY NECESSARILY SEE THIS BEING ADDRESSED HERE. THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AND IT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT HOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT -- AND WHETHER NOT WAS THE ECONOMIC ISSUES REGARDING CHART IS WHAT THIS WAS THE REAL ECONOMIC ISSUE WHAT'S A REASONABLE NUMBER OF CHARTERS THAT SHOULD EXIST IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SIZE OF THE DISTRICT. I MEAN THESE ARE SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT TO ME STILL ARE NOT ADDRESSED AND AND SO WHEN I SAW THE THREE BILLS COME FORWARD. WITH THE WOOD FOR THE AUTHORS FROM THIS COMMITTEE I BASICALLY SAID WAS A DONE DEAL. YOU KNOW IT'S A DONE DEAL THAT THIS IS THE DECISION THEY MADE AND THAT MY COLLEAGUES IN MAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH I THINK GREAT INTENTIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION. AROUND CHARTERS AND MANY OF YOU AS PARENTS HAVE -- YOU DON'T HAVE EXPRESSED THAT INTEREST BUT I'D STILL ASK THE QUESTION AND I WILL CONTINUE TO ASK A QUESTION WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS. AND WHY DO SO MANY PARENTS FEEL SOUL DESPERATE. FOR A CHARTER. YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND THIS TO BE TRUE THAT THEY SEE THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE THEY HAVE THE ONLY ANSWER THEY HAVE A MEET AND I HEAR THIS REGULARLY FROM PARENTS. AND WHAT I SHARED A DON'T SHARE THEIR THEIR VIEW OF THAT THE REALITY IS WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION. WHY IS IT THAT THERE'S SUCH A TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN CIARA'S WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC PIECE AND THERE'S SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE THAT ARE MAKING A BUNDLE ON CHARTERS AND THEN GETTING UP THE BUSINESS OF WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING? BUT WE STILL HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHY ARE FOLKS SO WILLING TO DO CHARTERS WE LIVE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL ALL RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL AND THEY WANT TO GO TO A CHARTER. YOU KNOW AND SO I I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ASK I'M NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL I'M GOING TO STAY OFF OF IT. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A RIGHT THAT YOU ALL THE INFORMATION YET AND LIKE I SAID I LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS FORMED. BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TO BASICALLY PROGRAMS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES AND HELP US COME TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT IS BEST -- WITH REGARDS TO CHARTERS AND I I STILL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT INFORMATION I'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT COMES IN IS HOW IT AFFECTS THESE THREE BILLS THAT ARE HERE. BUT I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE FOR THE BILL'S KNOWING THAT THAT WE THAT THAT MANY OF US ASK FOR TASK FORCE. AND NOW WE HAVE ONE AND IT'S JUST GOT STARTED AND WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF CHARTERS BEFORE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION BUT I WOULD THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THINKING ABOUT IT IT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE. I CAN'T SUPPORT IT UNTIL I GET MORE INFORMATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER KILEY. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR SO -- I'M SORRY I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- REMARKS YOU MADE IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS I THINK IT'LL LEAD AUTHOR THIS BILL. KATE WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE PERRY MASON THANK YOU KNOW I'M THE AUTHOR THE BILL RIGHT. SO YOU WANT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM UP HERE GET ON THERE I'M SORRY YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS FOR APPEAR GO TO OUR LIVES WE'VE GOT A JOINT AUTHORED THERE I THINK. YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION ONE ASKED IT'S ON THE FRONT. MR KILEY LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS I'M HERE OKAY SO PLEASE. IT'S OKAY TO BE NICE ASKED THE QUESTION WE USUALLY HAVE THE AUTHOR DOWN THERE ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT THE TRADITIONALLY WE HAVE AND ONE OF THE OTHER SO MAYBE MISTER BONTA WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND I MAY ASK HIM TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR ME SURCHARGE WHEN. I MAY HAVE QUESTIONS REST WE HAVE OTHER. AS WELL SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU SO. I'LL START WITH YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU MADE. IN YOUR REMARKS. IF YOU'RE A GOOD CHARTER OPERATOR YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT NOW I TAKE IT THIS IS A REFERENCE TO THE AMENDMENT YOU HAVE AGREED TO TAKE. SAYING THAT -- NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT WILL NOT BE A CONSIDERATION RENEWALS IS THAT RIGHT. IN GENERAL SPEAKS TO THE THE RE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS RIGHT SO. YOU CAN'T BE DENIED RE AUTHORIZATION -- ON THE BASIS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE AUTHORIZES SCHOOL DISTRICT PURSUANT YOUR ANSWER REPHRASE THE QUESTION [inaudible] OKAY. SO. THE AMENDED THE YOU SAID YOU'RE GONNA TAKE WILL MAKE IT SO I CHARTER THAT IS SEEKING TO GET RENEWED. CANNOT HAVE ITS RENEWAL DENIED. ON THE BASIS OF ANY NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT. ON THE AUTHORIZING DOES THAT THAT ISN'T THAT IS THE AMOUNT WE SEEK TO TAKE OKAY. AND SO IT'S I WANT THERE IS SOME COMMON THERE IS DISINFORMATION OUT THERE NO IT'S NOT THAT'S THIS IS THE BILL AS IT DESPITE. I'M RIGHT HERE I CAN HEAR YOU SO JUST YEAH GET OUT OF IT AFTER. WE CAN CONVERSE. THAT'S THE BILL AS WRITTEN AND I WAS EVEN CALLED A DRAFTING EVER MISTER BOND AS THERE'S BEEN NO DISINFORMATION BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHO'S EVEN TOO MUCH DRIVING YOUR IS IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO INCLUDE IN A MOMENT AND AND WE KNOW. OFTENTIMES IN THIS BUILDING BILLS COME THROUGH AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THEM MR THAT'S WHAT WE SEEK TO DO MISTER CHAIR AND CAN I CAN I SAY SOMETHING FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD BECAUSE I IT IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LIVE WHERE ALREADY DID TALK ABOUT THIS. A MOMENT SO I THOUGHT WHY DON'T I I APPRECIATE IT NO I NIGHT WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT MISTER CHAIR I I THINK WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BEFORE THE PUBLIC RECORDS WE'RE GONNA WORK IN LISTEN WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH YOU IN A MINUTE SO OF COURSE MR MCCARTY. THAT DID STATED THAT THAT DATE OR ALLEGED THAT THERE WAS DISINFORMATION AND LET'S BE CLEAR THE BILL IN PRINT RIGHT. BUT THERE'S NO MISINFORMATION AND PLAY YEAH WELL WE CAN ONLY RESPOND TO WHAT'S IN PRINT BUT I'M I'M QUITE CONFIDENT THERE'S BEEN CUT COMMUNICATION WITH YOU. AND THE MEMBERS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION THAT WE WOULD AMEND THAT SO. IT IS WHAT IT IS NOW OKAY PLAN NO MA'AM IT LIST. GANG I SAID IT IT'S HERE IT'S ON THE RECORD. THERE IT IS THANK YOU SO IF YOU ARE A CHARTER OPERATOR THAT -- YOU KNOW WAS LOOKING TO OPEN ANOTHER SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH DEMAND MORE DEMAND THAN THERE ARE SPOTS THAT'S HAPPENED FOR SOME OF THE CHARTERS IN MY DISTRICT IS. YOU KNOW THERE IS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO THERE -- THERE'S A LOT OF SPOTS SO EVENTUALLY OPEN OTHER SCHOOLS -- SO IN THAT SITUATION -- WOULD THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT BE A VALID FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN AUTHORIZING THE CHARTER. THE ES. IT'S A NEW CHARTER. AND UNDERSTANDING UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS -- BECAUSE THERE ARE NOW MORE CHARTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY UNDER -- FINANCIAL DURESS AND I THINK IT IS A VALID QUESTION SHOULD NOT AT ALL. THE THE ONLY QUESTION IS ASKED UPON APPROVAL BUT IT IS A VALID QUESTION TO ASK. IF THAT IS -- FINANCIALLY IMPACTFUL AND IN FACT CAN THE CHARTER. BE SUSTAIN FINANCIALLY. TO OKAY I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR YOU SAID THAT IF YOU'RE A GOOD CHARTER OPERATOR YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. BUT YOU KNOW SOMEONE OR OFTEN THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU WANT OPEN ANOTHER SCHOOL DOING PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MORE KIDS. YOU WOULD HAVE A FACTOR OTHER THAN THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT SCHOOL BE ROB IS THAT RIGHT. WELL YOU WOULD. IT'S A FIGHT AT THE FINANCIAL QUESTION WOULD BE ON PAR WITH THE OTHERS WHICH I THINK IT'S IT'S A VALID QUESTION ACT ASK. IT IS VALID TO ASK WHAT FINANCIAL IMPACT A NEW SCHOOL WOULD HAVE. AS FAR AS THAT STREET SCHOOL BEING ABLE TO BE SUSTAINED OR ITS IMPACT ON OTHER SCHOOLS. WHAT -- I MEAN HOW WOULD. HOW WOULD YOU ESTABLISH THIS -- YOU KNOW THE NEW FACTOR IS. NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT -- WHAT EVIDENCE WOULD YOU HAVE TO SHOW TO SUBSTANTIATE THAT THERE BE A NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT UNDER THIS BILL? WELL I'M SURE THERE WOULD BE AN APPLICATION PROCESS WHERE THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE ASCERTAINED SO EVEN IF IT'S A VERY MINOR NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT WOULD IT COULD A CHARTER BE DENIED ON THAT BASIS. I WOULD THINK -- BOARD WOULD TAKE THE SITUATION IN TOTALITY AND MAKE AN ACTION BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDED BUT IT WOULD BE LAWFUL FOR A BOARD TO DENY CHARTER ON THE BASIS OF A NEGATIVE. EVEN A MINOR NEGATIVE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE DOESN'T THAT RIGHT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE AND AGAIN. I'M NOT ON THE LOCAL BOARD. OKAY BUT I FOR ASK ABOUT THE LAW THAT YOU'RE SEEKING TO MAKE THE GOVERNOR'S THESE THINGS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS. THREE CHART RETURN THOSE DECISIONS THE LOCAL LEVEL BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SO YOU YOU SAID YOU WANT TO RETURN DECISIONS TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I THINK YOU TALKED ABOUT. WHAT AUTHORIZES SHOPPING WAS AT THE TERM? AND YOU MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS. GREATER DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY -- WITHIN THE AUTHORIZED -- WHEN THAT WHEN THAT CHARTER IS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AUTHORIZES SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS A ARGUMENT? YES YEAH WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A SITUATION WHERE. CHARTERS ARE BEING AUTHORIZED FAR AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY MAY SIT IN. AND THERE IS LITTLE TO NO OVERSIGHT OF THESE CHAR'S WHAT WE FOUND AYE AYE TO I TALKED ABOUT THE ARTICLES WE HAVE PEOPLE MAKING LOTS OF MONEY OFF THESE CHARTERS. KIDS NOT BEING SERVED WELL AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE A RATHER UNFORTUNATE SITUATION FOR THE STUDENTS. AND AND AND AND THE THE THE AUTHORIZED. FOR SO WHAT ABOUT COUNTS THAT COUNTIES HAVE DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY -- THEY'RE MORE MEMBERS ARE POPULARLY ELECTED -- YET THIS BILL SEEKS TO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES ELIMINATE THE ROLE -- WHY IS DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHEN IT COMES TO THE COUNTY? BUT WELL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT TOTALLY ELIMINATING THE ROLE BUT WE'RE SAYING IS IT SHOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION WERE CHAIRED AND WERE RETURNING DECISIONS TO LOCAL BASIS. OKAY SO WHY IS I I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'M A FIRM SUPPORTER OF LOCAL CONTROL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT FALL IT FALLS BACK ON THE LOCALS. OUR COUNTY IS NOT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS. THE REGIONAL DECISION MAKERS I WOULD SAY THEY'RE VERY MUCH LOCAL DECISION OKAY SO WHY IS IT THAT. I MEAN WHY IS THAT A DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS IN THIS CONTEXT. YOU TELL ME. WELL NOW YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S ACTUALLY PUTTING THAT DISTINCTION THE LAW SO I THINK YOU WANT TO TELL ME WELL IT'S IT'S IT'S A GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD CONCEPT THAT COUNTIES MAKE DECISIONS ON A REGIONAL BASIS. AND FOR INSTANCE A SCOLD SCHOOL DISTRICT MAKES DECISIONS ON A VERY LOCAL -- BASIS ONLY WITHIN THE CONFINES. OF THAT DISTRICT SO WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS ALLOW THAT DISTRICT WHICH MANAGES THAT. THAT. WITHIN THE CONFINES THAT BOUNDARY TO MAKE THE DECISIONS NOT TO PASS IT ON TO SOMEONE WHO WOULD NOT. A REALLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ON ON I SEE COOPERATION AND A VERY LOCAL BASIS UNDERSTAND SOME THESE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. FROM WHERE THE SCHOOL SIT SO HE'S AUTHORIZE OR SITS FAR FAR AWAY STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO TALK HOW FAR AWAY FROM SOME OF THESE ARE THAT IS AN ANSWER. SEVENTIES SO THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS SIT FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND THEY'RE JUST IS NOT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT I THINK YOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE GOING TO JAIL. YOU SEEN CHARTERS CLOSING OVERNIGHT YOU SEEN FINANCIAL DISASTERS AND I THINK TODAY WE NEED TO FIX THAT OKAY I WAS TALKING ABOUT COUNTIES SO SOME COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY SMALLER THAN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN TELL YOU WHAT COUNTY THEY LIVE IN A LOT OF YOU MIGHT EVEN KNOW WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY HAPPEN TO BE AND SO WHY IT. IS THAT NOT CONSIDERED A FORM OF LOCAL CONTROL BUT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR CHARTER AUTHORIZED. BECAUSE AGAIN WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS RETURN THE DECISION OF LOCAL CONTROL A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. HAS CONTROL OVER ITS OWN BOUNDARIES AND AND AND I SUPPORT THAT YOU MAY NOT I DO. AT A COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS OWN BOUNDARIES I'M SORRY. BUT WHATEVER I COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER ITS OWN BOUNDARIES THAT WE'RE SAYING SURE DOES [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S GO ON TO A THE PORTION OF THIS BILL. THAT WOULD ELIMINATE GROWTH IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CHARTER REAL WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THAT. I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME WHY DOES THE BELL THE MINUTE GROWTH IN ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CHARTER RENEWAL -- DOESN'T IT IT DOES NOT. IT IS STILL A FACTOR IT IS STILL A FACTOR BUT IT'S NO LONGER THE PRIMARY FACTOR WHY DO YOU THINK THAT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT SHOULD NOT BE THE PRIMARY FACTOR. WELL IT PUTS IT ON PAR WITH OTHER FACTORS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME CHARTER THAT ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT OUR FINANCIAL DISASTERS WE HAVE TO THE TRI VALLEY EXAMPLE. WHERE IN A CHARTER -- CHARTER WENT BANKRUPT WHEN OUT OF BUSINESS YET THE THE BUILDING THEY BOUGHT WITH PUBLIC MONEY ENDED UP IN PRIVATE HANDS. THE BUILDING WAS WORTH A LOT OF MONEY THE STUDENTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH THE SCHOOLS GOING DOWN THE TUBES FINANCIALLY. SO THERE'S A BALANCE TO BE FOUND -- BUT LISTEN I'M AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I WANT STUDENT SUCCESS I WANT OUR STUDENTS TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH US IF IF CHARTER IS -- IS IS IS IS FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO NEED TO LOOK I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY ATTENTION THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF ANY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATION. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU MAY NOT YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THAT BUT THAT'S MY PERCEPTION MY POSITION. THAT'S OFTEN UP. THANK YOU -- THAT -- MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT I REALLY PERSON DIALOG. PUSH THE DOWN ESPECIALLY AS OF LATE SO THE CONVERSATION FROM THE CHARTER EXPLICA THERE'S ROOM FOR A LOT OF COMMON GROUND AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. OPTICALLY WITH THE AMENDMENT AND THE CLARITY THERE I THINK THAT -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT -- IS A TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF US IS THAT -- NO ONE WANTS ANYONE WHETHER IT'S A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL OR A CHARTER SCHOOL TO BEA POOR PERFORMER I I THINK THAT WE WANT TO DO OUR BEST UP THAT ALL CHILDREN ALL SCHOOLS. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WITH THE THE CLARIFICATION -- THAT'LL BE FORTHCOMING THAT THAT HELPS ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AT LEAST FROM THE SCHOOLSTHAT ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN OPERATING WELL -- AND IF THERE'S FURTHER NEEDS FOR CONVERSATION AMENDMENTS WHAT HAVE YOU THE DIALOGUE CONTINUES IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING. I'VE NEVER YEAH I WOULD I WON THIS ONE OF MY THIRD YEAR I'VE NEVER SEEN A BILL THAT'S INTRODUCED THAT ISN'T AMENDED -- NUMEROUS TIMES AS IT MAKES ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND SO -- IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET FEEDBACK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND APPRECIATED EVERYONE THAT CAME ON BOTH SIDES TO PROVIDE THAT BE BACK -- BECAUSE THAT THAT IN ADDITION. TO CLEARLY UP SOME OF THE THE THE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE GREATER EXPERTISE -- CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE HELPS. NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN TO MAKE IT BETTER BILL. AND TO IMPROVE ON THE BILL AND CREATE CLARITY WHERE IT'S NECESSARY AS HAS BEEN SICK -- DEMONSTRATED BY THE CHAIR. AND SO -- I ALSO -- SHE DOCTOR WEBER'S COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SUPPORT OF CONVERSATIONS. THAT THE AND THAT'S AND THAT'S A A TWO WAY STREET BOTH IN TERMS OF COLLEAGUES DOING ONE OTHER BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. IS GONNA BE IT OF OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WERE AT LEAST THERE'S UNDERSTANDING THAT -- THAT. THE GOOD THE ULTIMATE GOALS AS STATED BY DOCTOR WEBER NEED TO BE SIMILAR OR THE SAME HOLE FOR THE SAME OR SOMETIMES IT CAN BE THE SAME ONLY SIMILAR. IN THE SENSE OF ENSURING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THESE A PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT REQUIRED THE SAME KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS REQUIRES. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A COMMON GROUND THAT CAN BE HAD HERE. WE ALSO RARELY SEE BILLS THAT HAVE A 100% UNANIMOUS SUPPORT ON EVERY ITEM BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT I KNOW THE CHAIR OF HIM HAVING SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE AND SEEN HUNDREDS OF THE HOUSE COMPASS ME THE CHAIR ALWAYS. TRIES TO STRIVE FOR AN AND BEING OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PRIMARY AUTHORED THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AND I AND I JUST WANNA MAKE MAYES WAS A MENTION OF AND I AND I TOLD I NEED TO BECAUSE I WAS. VERY SPECIFICALLY MENTION REGARDS TO IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT ALUM ROCK AND JUST TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR I THINK THAT ANYONE HAS PAID ATTENTION DOWN OCT KNOWS THAT. I CALLED FOR THE AUDIT OF THE ALAMO SCHOOL DISTRICT I SUPPORTED THE GRAND JURY RECOMMENDATION TO THAT THREE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS SHOULD RESIGN -- SINCE THEN TWO OF THE MEMBER OUR PLACE TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS -- THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS UNFAIRLY TARGETED BY THE PREVIOUS BOARD MAJORITY. HAD BEEN -- TRYING HER BEST TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAS SUPPORTED ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF SUPPORTER IN THAT WORK. AND WITH THE NEW BORDER MAJORITY I HOPE -- EFFECTIVE FORMS BE PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE I BOARD. THE BOYS ACTUAL HARM PUT ALL SCHOOLS CHARTER AND OTHERWISE AND IF THERE'S SOME AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE -- I HOPE -- BUT ANYONE THAT'S BEEN PAYING ATTENTION ALUM ROCK THAT IT'S IN A BETTER PLACE NOW IN TERMS OF CHANGES IN THE LEADERSHIP. IS A LOT AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE NEED TO BE VOLATILE BLACKED OUT THE NEED TO AT LEAST MENTION THAT. IS WAS VERY SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED AND AND I THINK THAT WITH THE I. I HOPE THERE'S AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE YOU'RE ON ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THAT OUR BROUGHT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HOPEFULLY ALL CAN WORK TO CERTAINLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND SO. WITH THAT -- I I I I WANT TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE TO EVERYONE THAT CAME TODAY EVERYONE ON BOTH SIDES PROVIDING EXPERTISE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT AGAIN THAT EXPERTISE IS GOING TO BE NEEDED. GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THE GOOD WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES I AND AGAIN AS DR WEBER SAID AND I AGREE A 100% -- WILL CERTAINLY IS A PRINCE ACOSTA I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THEIR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD I WOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED ON IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THE INTENTIONS WERE GOOD. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE GOOD IN GOING FORWARD AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED -- DEBATE AND AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND AS A DOES MOVE FORWARD IF THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME FORTH OUT FROM THE GOVERNOR SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTIONS. AS INDICATED BY THE CHAIR -- THAT THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR GOING FORWARD AS WELL -- SO WITH SO AGAIN THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT CAME FOR TODAY [inaudible] UP. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AND I'M SORRY I JOIN AUTHOR I DID NOT LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO MR KYLIE'S QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THOSE. PLEASE ADDED AN OTHERWISE YOU MAY HANDLE THE CLOTHES THANK YOU THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR WITNESSES WHO TESTIFIED SUBSTANTIVELY AND ALSO REGISTER THEIR SUPPORT TODAY. I JUST WANNA MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED -- BRIEFLY OUT ONE IS THERE'S BEEN REPEATED REFERENCE TO THIS THIS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. IT'S A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WHO. ARE WILL BE DIGGING DEEP INTO A POLICY AREA THAT THAT NEEDS TO DEEP DIVE THAT WE EAGERLY AWAIT. THE REPORT FROM IN THERE AND INPUT FROM -- AND THEY ARE ALSO NOT THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] THAT. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. IT'S OUR ROLE TO TO LOOK IF IT'S AT THAT SET OF LAWS AND IDENTIFY WHETHER WHICH ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. IF THERE'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF IT CAN BE STRENGTHENED IMPROVED IF THIS PLACE TO FIX IT MAKE IT BETTER MAKE IT STRONGER MAKE IT BETTER FOR KIDS PARENTS. TEACHERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WHILE THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION HAS THE ESSENTIAL ROLE. AND AND I I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR I APPLIED A SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ROLE -- WE WE WILL AND WE'LL BE LISTENING TO IT AND INCORPORATING -- ITS IDEAS -- THERE REALLY IS A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE HERE AND TERMS OF BEING ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SENT HERE TO ADDRESS BIG POLICY ISSUES LIKE LIKE THIS ONE SO -- I I I I I M. I KNOW IT'LL ADD VALUE TO LOOK FOR TO IT I JUST WANT TO SORT OF TRY OUT AND HE'S OUT THAT DISTINCTION A LITTLE BIT. ALSO WANT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- YOU KNOW. MUCH OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROVIDING. MORE LOCAL CONTROL IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT SO MANY TIMES IN THIS BUILDING -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE FOLKS TOUT THE IDEA OF LOCAL CONTROL THAT THOSE NEAREST TO THE PROBLEM OUR BEST LOCATED TO PROVIDE THE SOLUTIONS. AND AFTER THIS BILL DOES AND IN POWERS OUR OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD LEADERS WHO ARE. ELECTED TO STAND UP FOR KIDS AND PROVIDE -- RACIAL EQUITY AN OPPORTUNITY AND TO STAND UP FOR TEACHERS AND PARENTS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THE CONSIDER DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT ARE RELEVANT. AND NOT TO BE WILLFULLY BLINDED TO CERTAIN FACTS THAT COULD BE RELEVANT TO AN ANALYSIS NOT TO BE WILLFULLY BLIND AT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OR TWO IMPACT ON FACILITIES BUT TO CONSIDER THEM -- MANY OF THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WILL UP LEFT THE IDEA OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AS THE TOP ISSUE WILL UP LEFT THE IDEA OF ACADEMIC SUCCESS AS THEIR TOP ISSUE. THAT'S THEIR RIGHT -- BUT THEY SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST CONSIDER. OTHER FACTORS LIKE FINANCIAL IMPACT -- IMPACT ON FACILITIES THAT TO THIS BILL -- ASKS SO AND I I WANT TO JUST -- UPLIFT AS A MEMBER SERVICE MATHS. CONCEPT I I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT AS I'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO OUR CURRENT CHARTER SCHOOL LAW ON THE IDEA OF OF OF WHAT THE INNOVATIONS AND GOAL THIS. TO ME THE END GOAL IS IS. TO RECAPTURE. EFFECTIVE IMPACTFUL INNOVATION APPROACHES SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM AND TO SCALE. AND IF SOMEONE HAS UNLOCKED -- A PROCESS FOR HOW -- TO THEN THE NEEDLE OR ARE THAT. BEND THE CURVE. FOR BLACK AND BROWN KIDS AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. WHY SHOULD THAT BE LIMITED TO ONE CORNER OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ONE SCHOOL? FOR COUPLES WHY CAN'T IT BE SOME OF THAT COULD BENEFIT ALL -- BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BEYOND -- SO I JUST ASK THAT QUESTION NOT TO ATTRIBUTE ANY -- BLAME BUT JUST TO SAY THAT THE KIND OF THING I THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT GETTING BACK TO BASICS ON AND I ALSO JUST WANT A DOCTOR WEBER FOR ALWAYS LOOKING AT EVERYTHING. THREE JUSTICE LANDS FOR AN EQUITY THROUGH AN EQUITY LANDS -- WE MUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD SHOULD THIS BILL GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE -- KEEP THE S. S. DO NINETY MINUT OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS -- FOREMOST AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE OF OUR CHILDREN CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE FULL POTENTIAL REALIZE THEIR DREAMS -- WITHOUT RESPECT ASK THE I'VE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AGAIN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE PAST YOU APPROPRIATIONS WITH AMEDMENTS TO BE TAKING AND APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL AYE KILEY NO KILEY KNOWN KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE SMITH. SMITH I WEBER. WEBER NOT VOTING. FOR BILL HAS FOR VOTED IS OUT THANK YOU. THIRTY WE'RE NOW GOING TO FILE ITEM. THIRTY AB FIFTEEN OH SIX AB FIFTEEN OH SIX OKAY WE'RE NOW GOING TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTY WHICH IS AB. FIFTEEN OH SIX MISS MCCARTY'S GOING TO PRESENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'D FIRST LIKE -- TO THANK YOU AND THAT COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE PROPOSAL AND WILL BE ACCEPTING THE THAT COMMITTEE. SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. ESSENTIALLY THIS MEASURE. I THINK IT IS JUST AS PROBABLY HEATED FROM THE POLITICS AS A PRIOR MEASURE BUT I THINK A BIT MORE SIMPLE. IN ITS NOT THAT YOU'RE MEASURE WAS NOT AN IMPORTANT ONE USED TO SHARE BUT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS A BIT MORE OF A SIMPLE -- EQUATION I THINK PEOPLE WITH WOULD UNDERSTAND. THIS MEASURE WOULD ESTABLISH A CAP ON THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS OPERATING AT BOTH THE STATEWIDE. AND LOCAL LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OF COURSE THE LAN THE LANDS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AS MR BONTA ALLUDED. TO THEY WERE CREATED TO BE -- LABORATORIES OF LEARNING AND HAVE SERVED A VITAL ROLE. HOWEVER THIS CHARTER SCHOOL GROWTH HAS PLAYED A ROLE. NOT THE ROLE A ROLE IN THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CHARTER SCHOOL GROWTH HAS REMAINED STEADY IN THE STATE OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. LEADING TO MORE AND MORE AND STABILITY WE ALL KNOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED BASED UPON ATA AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. AT IS DECLINING STATEWIDE. THAT MEANS FEWER FUNDING AND FEWER THAT MEANS LESS FUNDING AND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF COURSE ETA'S DECLINE BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OUR STATE. BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. COMPETITION FOR THESE SCARCE EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS BETWEEN DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOL. BREED STRESS AND TENSION THAT'S LEADING TO A SCHOOLS WEARING IS. TO OPEN ADDITIONAL CHARTERS OF COURSE. MANY TITLE ONE SCHOOLS FACE GREAT CHALLENGES WITH EDUCATING OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. A SPREADING FINITE RESOURCES AMONG BOTH CHARTER SCHOOLS AND TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS EQUITY IN SKIN A SCHOOL DISTRICT. EVEN IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DID NOT APPROVE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL. ESSENTIAL WE HAVE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IS WERE FUNDING TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS. LIKE A FAMILY. WITH THAT. WITH THAT THE I. CAPPED INCOME. FUNDING TO HOUSEHOLDS. IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE. THIS BILL WILL GRANT SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH SOME FINANCIAL RELIEF BY CURBING CHARTER SCHOOL SCHOOL GROWTH. IT'S NOT A BAND IT'S NOT A MORATORIUM HAVE SOME VAST I THINK THIS IS A FAIR SOLUTION. IT WON'T CLOSE SCHOOLS AGAIN THIS WILL NOT CLOSE SCHOOLS. DESPITE WHICH MANY -- THINK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THIS BILL WOULD INSTITUTE A ROLLING CAP. MEANING THAT WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES. ANOTHER CHARTER SCHOOL MAY TAKE THAT SLOT AND WE'RE AND WE'RE WE'RE ADJUSTING AND AMENDING THE PROPOSAL NOT ON THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS BUT UPON THE ATA. SO IN OTHER WORDS KIND OF THINK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE HERE. SO IF A FAILING SCHOOL NOT A GOOD ANALYSIS CAP AND TRADE NOT A POPULAR PROGRAM. BUT THE MATHEMATICAL PART ABOUT CAP AND TRADE. IS SOMETHING WE WE WE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. SO IF ONE OF THAT. POOR PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL CLOSES AND WE HAVE A THRIVING CHARTER SCHOOL LIKE WE HEARD FROM EARLIER TODAY DRIVING CHARTER SCHOOLS. THEY CAN OPEN THIS PLACE. A ROLLING CAT. AGAIN THIS RECOGNIZES THAT THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE ON THE DISTRICT'S. COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND FINANCES. AT THAT TWO THINGS ABOUT THEIR FINANCES YOU KNOW WE HAVE DISTRICTS IN FINANCIAL STRESS. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT LOS ANGELES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OAKLAND. RIGHT HERE IN MY HOMETOWN OF SACRAMENTO OUR DISTRICT IS LITERALLY ON THE BRINK. MAY RUN OUT OF CASH IN THE COMING MONTHS. IS IT BECAUSE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. PROBABLY NOT PROBABLY WASN'T THE ISSUE IS IT A FACTOR IT'S GOING ON AS FAR AS THEIR THEIR ATTENDANCE. POTENTIALLY THERE ARE CHARTER SCHOOL POPULATION TO ABOUT 12%. ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS HOWEVER. IF THAT GREW BY 10% NEXT YEAR TO THE THEIR FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT -- THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT GROWTH WOULD PUT THIS DISTRICT ON THE BRINK. AND THAT'S WERE FACING UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S THE ISSUE WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE REPORT COMING BY OUR GOVERNOR. AND OUR SUPERINTENDENT. OUR COLLEAGUE MR BONTA SAID IT WELL THAT'S THE THOSE ARE TWO STATEWIDE ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE THE LEGISLATURE. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS AS WELL. BUT SHOULD THIS REPORT COME OUT WITH SOME GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS -- REST ASSURED THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT BECOME LAW. WHEN THAT REPORT COMES OUT WE'LL BE GOING AT IT AS WE KNOW UNTIL THE END OF SUMMER END OF AUGUST EARLY SEPTEMBER? THE REPORT THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE S. P. ARE WORKING ON WILL BE OUT WITHIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND ALLOW US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND POTENTIALLY -- BRIDGE THAT MEANT THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE HERE -- SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MIKE MY TWO WITNESSES -- CLEAR CRAWFORD SENIOR POLICY ANALYST WITH IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST MISTER JEFFREY BEAR SUPERINTENDENT OF A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THE LOS ALTOS SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE BAY AREA. THANK YOU. HI I'M CLEAR PRO FOR THE SENIOR POLICY ADVISER IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE FINDINGS FROM TWO OF OUR REPORTS THAT DOCUMENT SOME OF THE FISCAL AND RESULTING. EDUCATIONAL IMPACT OF CALIFORNIA'S UNRESTRICTED CHARTER SECTOR GROWTH ON DISTRICT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I'M AB FIFTEEN OH SIX ALONG WITH A COMING BILLS BEFORE YOU TODAY WILL GO ALONG WAY IN ADDRESSING THESE IMPACTS. ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT SPENDING BLIND EXAMINED CALIFORNIA'S ON TARGETED IN HAPHAZARD SYSTEM FOR FACILITIES FINANCING OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD RECEIVED MORE THAN TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE FUNDS TO LEASE BUILDER BY SCHOOL BUILDINGS. MUCH OF THIS FUNDING WENT TO SCHOOL THAT OPENED WHERE THERE ARE ALREADY ENOUGH CLASSROOM SPACES FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND TO SCHOOL THAT DID NOT PROVIDE A BETTER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THE NEARBY TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT SERVE DEMOGRAPHICALLY SIMILAR STUDENTS. WE FOUND THE PUBLIC FACILITIES FUNDING HAD BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY CONCENTRATED AMONG THE LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY CHARTER MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS. OPERATING CHAINS OF BETWEEN THREE AND THIRTY SCHOOLS. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS HAD ALSO BEEN USED BY CMO IS TO BUY PRIVATE PROPERTY. OUR SECOND REPORT RELEASED IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN DOCUMENTS -- THE IMPACT ON LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WHEN A STUDENT LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL FOR CHARTER SCHOOL ALL THE FUNDING FOR THAT STUDENT LEAVES WITH THEM HOWEVER NOT ALL THE COSTS. TO OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT BREAKING POINT DOCUMENTED THESE NOT COSTS OF CALIFORNIA'S AND RESTRAINED CHARTER GROWTH WHICH LEADS TO CUTTING CORE SERVICES LIKE COUNSELING IN LIBRARIES AND NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS. USING OUR MOST CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES WE FOUND THAT OAKLAND UNIFIED LOST FIFTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION PER YEAR. THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED LESS PER STUDENT ATTENDING A NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL THE ANNUAL COST OF SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WAS SIXTY FIVE POINT NINE MILLION. AND HE SAID UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THE NET IMPACT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WAS NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION PER YEAR. AB FIFTY NO SIX WILL HELP ENSURE THAT STRONG EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD FLOURISH WITHOUT FURTHER HARMING THE EDUCATION OF THE 90% OF STUDENTS THAT ATTEND DISTRICT MANAGED SCHOOLS. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JEFFREY BEAR I'M SUPERINTENDENT LOS ALTOS SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY NO SEX YET WOULD LIKE TO SEE. MODIFICATION. I SUPPORT A AP ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS YET A LIMITATION ON CHARTER SCHOOL ENROLLMENT ALONE IS OUR ON ENROLLMENT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. ARE ALREADY OPERATING IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ROMAN RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS AN AGGREGATE TOTAL PERCENTAGE CAP ON STUDENTS TRANSFERRING TO CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHIN THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE IMPRECISE MEANS OF ADDRESSING THAT HAS GONE DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS CHARTER SCHOOLS CREATE. A PERCENTAGE ENROLLMENT CAP IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DISTRICT OF CHOICE LEGISLATION ALREADY IN PLACE. WHICH SAFEGUARD TO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FISCAL HEALTH BY CAPPING THE NUMBER OF OUTBOUND STUDENT TRANSFERS. STUDIES SHOW THE CHARTER SCHOOL GROWTH DRAINS MONEY AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND THOSE STUDENTS BEAR THE COST OF ON CHECK CARD CHARTER EXPANSION UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN DISTRICTS LOSE ENROLLMENT TO CHARTERS THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO LAY OFF STAFF AN INCREASE CLASS SIZE WHAT'S WORSE. MANY CHARTERS LEAVE BEHIND THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS TO COST THE MOST EDUCATE. SIMPLY PUT AS A OPERATE TODAY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE INCREASINGLY INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RELEASED DATA. JUST THIS PAST MARCH. CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF DISADVANTAGED SUB GROUPS SUCH AS ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS MIGRANT STUDENTS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. WHAT? WELL IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL INTENSE. WE CREATED A TWO TIERED EDUCATION SYSTEM WHERE MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO SERVE THE NARROW INTERESTS OF A SELECTED GROUP OF STUDENTS TO THE DETRIMENT OF DISTRICT STUDENTS WHETHER HIGH OR LOW ACHIEVING WHICH ARE LEFT WITH FEWER RESOURCES. THE UNREGULATED ABILITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS TO ENROLL UNLIMITED STUDENTS WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION TO THE IMPACTS UPON THE LOCAL COMMUNITY UNDERMINES OUR COMMITMENT TO A PUBLIC EDUCATION THE DENTURES WE MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF ALL STUDENTS. PLEASE ENACTED BE FIFTEEN NO SEX. PLEASE ALSO STRONGLY CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE ENROLLMENT LIMITATIONS TO PROTECT EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND FISCAL HEALTH OF ALL STUDENTS -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR SEVEN RAMBLE HERE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WEREN'T SUPPORT I'M HERE.

RACHEL SMITH FOURTH GRADE TEACHER AT ABC UNIFIED AND MEMBER OF ABC FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. CATHERINE HAS QUAL HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER ABC FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. CHERI LEWIS I'M RETIRED FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED I HOME SCHOOL CHILD HER CHARTER SCHOOL AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL OKAY. THE SUPPORT IS NOW COMPLETE NOW WILL GO TO THE OPPOSITION THE OPPOSITE IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL COME FORWARD YOU MAY PROCEED [inaudible] THE FIRST. HELLO MY NAME IS MARGARET FORTUNE ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FORTUNE SCHOOL AND THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. AND I AM IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- MY CONCERN IS THAT A CAP ON CHARTER SCHOOLS REPRESENTS A CAP ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS -- IN THE CASE OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT I RUN THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION MADE A FINDING OF FACT BASED. BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THAT THERE IS A SEVERE AND PERSISTENT AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN ALL OF THE TH THE COUNTIES THIRTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SUCH A THERE IS NO PLACE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY COULD GO AND NOT CONFRONT THIS GAP. AND SO THEY CHIU CHOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY. TO APPROVE OUR NETWORK OF SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLOSING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN OF COURSE WERE OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS. WE ARE THE ONLY CHARTER SCHOOL THAT THAT THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVES SO IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL. WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IS THAT IN ORDER FOR A NEW? CHARTER SCHOOL FROM FORTUNE SCHOOL TO BE OPEN AN EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOL AND AND FORTUNE SCHOOL WOULD HAVE TO BE CLOSED -- IT WOULD CANNIBALIZE OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. THIS IS A TIGHT RESTRICTION ON THE PROGRESS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT. THERE ARE STUDENTS. AND YOU SAW MANY OF THEIR PARENTS TODAY. AND THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. THAT ARE DESPERATELY SEEKING ANOTHER OPTION WITHIN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM -- THAT -- THAT DESIRE IS REAL -- YOU CAN'T FAKE THAT. AND IN THE CASE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY IT'S VERY WILL ESTABLISH THE BLACK STUDENTS ARE THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP OTHER OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. THE DISTRICT THAT MR MCCARTY MAKES REFERENCE TO SACK CITY ONLY 13% OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS MEET STEP MET STANDARDS ON THE LAST STATE ASSESSMENT OF MATHEMATICS. A CAP ON SCHOOLS. BETTER DESIGNED TO CLOSE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. ARE IS A REAL INJUSTICE TO THE FAMILIES THAT NEED OPPORTUNITIES. THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL. IS THAT IT SUGGESTS THAT NGUYEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A NEW SCHOOL I WOULD WOULD BE CREATED THAT. AN EXPERIENCED OPERATOR COULDN'T DO THAT WORK -- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON CARLOS ARE CARED CABS HERE REPRESENTING THAT CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. TO AB -- FIFTEEN OH SIX AS MISFORTUNE HIGHLIGHTED BRIEFLY A. B. FIFTEEN OH SIX MAKES AN ARBITRARY JUDGMENT THAT SOMEHOW NEW SINGLE SITE CHARTERS ARE BETTER PREPARED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. OVER OPERATORS WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS OPERATING EXISTING SCHOOLS. THIS POLICY RUNS COUNTER TO STRONG EVIDENCE BY THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON EDUCATED ON EDUCATION OUTCOMES AT STANFORD. THAT IN CALIFORNI IN BOTH THE READING AND MATH STUDENTS IN CMO TO HAVE LARGER LEARNING GAINES PER YEAR. THEN THERE DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS AND THEN THERE INDEPENDENT SINGLE SITE CHARTER SCHOOL PEERS. THE DIFFERENCE IS EQUIVALENT TO A STUDENT ATTENDING SEVENTEEN ADDITIONAL DAYS OF SCHOOL PER LEARNING IN BOTH SUBJECTS. SO THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF ATTENDING A CMO IS EVEN LARGER FOR BLACK IN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS AND THE GAINES EVEN GREATER AMONG BLACK IN LATIN NEXT STUDENTS IN POVERTY. AND THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS OF GROUPS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE WIDEST LEARNING GAPS IN DISTRICT SCHOOLS. AS STANFORD RESEARCH FINDS AND SO FURTHER WE NEW SCHOOLS ARE REPLICATED BY SEE A MOST. CREDO FOUND THAT THOSE SCHOOLS PRODUCE LEARNING RESULTS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT ARE MORE POSITIVE THAN THEIR DISTRICT PEERS SO THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT SEE A MOST IN CALIFORNIA. I UNDERSTAND THIS HOW TO SCALE AND REPLICATE HIGH QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. SO WHY WOULD WE DISADVANTAGED THESE TYPES OF CHARTERS FROM OPENING NEW SCHOOLS. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO RAISE TO RESPOND THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS ON A. B. FIFTEEN OH SIX IS THE DEEPLY FLAWED MISLEADING RESEARCH BY IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. I PROVIDED WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN FULL BY ROBIN LAKE THE DIRECTOR OF CENTER ON REINVENTING PUBLIC EDUCATION TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

LET'S SEE IT'S SUBSECTION EIGHT TWO OF YOUR BILL SAYS THAT -- THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A CHARTER PETITION SUBMITTED UNDER THIS PART ESTABLISH A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT WILL NOT BE OPERATED BY AN ENTITY THAT IS OPERATING AT A CHARTER SCHOOL.

BUT THERE IS A THOUGHT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY EVALUATING AND AND SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD WILL KEY LOOK AT IT. IS SIMPLY A ALLOW THESE -- YOU KNOW LACK OF BETTER TERM CORPORATE STYLE AT T. CHARTER OPERATORS TO COME INTO COMMUNITY AND OPEN. ONE WHEN THEY REALLY ARE GONNA BE FOCUSED ON THAT COMMUNITY. LIKE A LOCAL ENTITY WAY. SO THE NOTION IS TO GIVE PRIORITIES TO A NEW CHARTER OPERATOR THAT AS MORE ROOTS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT RECENTLY. WAS -- EVALUATED WHEN WE SAT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION AND YOU WERE OPEN TO LOOKING AT THAT THAT PIECE GOING. FOR SO YOU'RE OPEN TO TAKING UP OR OUT OF IT OR MAYBE MODIFYING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WORKING AT THAT THE SO I THINK IT RAISES SOME LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THERE IS CAPACITY HAS SOME WE ALL AGREE THERE ARE SOME BAD OPERATORS AND SO IF IF A CHARTER SCHOOL -- SHUTS DOWN. OR YOU KNOW PHASES OUT FOR WHATEVER REASON AND WE HAVE CAPACITY TO OPEN UP A NEW SCHOOL SERVING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BASED UPON THAT. EIGHTY EIGHT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY WHAT'S GOING TO BE A STABLE ENTITY THERE. CAN BE A LONG TERM NET POSITIVE FOR THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S BEEN THAT SOME REFERENCE TO A STUDY FROM -- THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON EDUCATION OUTCOME SO JUST FOR THE RECORD I WANT -- TO SAY WHAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT STUDY FOUND HI THIS IS A QUOTE IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC GROWTH OVER TIME CHARTER SCHOOLS TO SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND URBAN AREAS. AND PROFESSIONALLY LOWER PERFORMING STUDENT GROUPS AS FOLLOWS. STUDENTS ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED ESPECIALLY THOSE WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO IT'S A DEFINITELY GREATER PROGRESS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THEIR MATCH PEERS IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BLACK STUDENTS IN GENERAL FOUND HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE ACT IN A PROGRESS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND POVERTY WAS EVEN MORE POSITIVELY AFFECTED. CHARTER SCHOOLS PROVIDE GREATER LEARNING GAMES FOR STUDENTS IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPPORT. FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THE CHARTER SCHOOL ADVANTAGES PARTICULARLY LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL IN OTHER STATES. AND FINALLY CHARTER SCHOOL SERVING DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION AND SERVE MORE STUDENTS ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE. SO GIVEN THESE FACTS WHY IS THIS THE SECTOR OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM WHOSE GROWTH WE WANT TO LIMIT. WELL FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT STUDY BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY PASS ON TO ME AND WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A LOOK -- YOU KNOW THE I THINK THIS IS A REALITY CHECK FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OUR TAXPAYERS THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] TODAY. WE KNOW THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE A ROLE WE KNOW THERE'S SOME HIGH ACHIEVING CHARTER SCHOOLS. BUT THEN VITAL GROWTH YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AND WE'RE GONNA SEE THE CONSEQUENCES HEARING YOUR COMMUNITIES IN MY COMMUNITY AT THE STATE CAPITOL AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO THRIVE THAT ARE EXISTING TODAY. AND CONTRARY TO THE LETTERS THAT I GOT OVER AND OVER FROM ROCKET SHIP. WITH THESE MEASURES ARE NOT GOING TO CLOSE DOWN. CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS CASE I'M GONNA PUT A MORATORIUM. SOME OF ASKED ME TO GO DOWN. SOME OF SAID WE SHOULD GET RID OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS IS NOT THAT THIS I THINK IS A FAIR SOLUTION WHICH ALLOWED CHARTER SCHOOLS TO THRIVE. AND ASK POPULATIONS DECREASE RESISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS WE CAN OPEN NEW ONES BUT PROVIDING SOME FINANCIAL BREATHING ROOM. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO CLEAR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT. FOLKS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THERE YOU KNOW VOLUNTARY KNOWN SPORTS GO TO ANY PARTICULAR SCHOOL SO I'D ASK YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT. OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU. SEE NO FURTHER COMING FROM COMMITTEES A BILL THEN MOVED. WELL I I I I WILL NOT JUST REITERATE WHAT I'VE SAID OF COURSE IN TERMS OF PROCESS. BUT I DO HOPE AT SOME POINT IN THIS -- DISCUSSION THAT WE FIGURE OUT -- WHAT'S THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF ALL OF THIS STUFF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IN OTHER WORDS. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO GUARANTEES OR NO DISCUSSION. OF HOW EITHER PUTTING A CAP. ONE CHARTERS OR WHATEVER PROCESS WE HAVE WILL BENEFIT THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO ARE REMAINING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR WHO MAY BE FORCED TO GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL. IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE A SITUATION WHERE THEIR CHART IS CLOSE TO WHAT HAPPENED. THESE PANTS THOUGH SINCE OF DESPERATION AND I THINK MOST OF YOU SINCE THAT. THAT -- AND AND AND I THINK IT'S IT'S WRONG TO TRY TO CONNECT -- THE PROLIFERATION OF CHARTERS WITH THE LIMITED -- OUTCOMES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE IF SO THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY SAYING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO DO BETTER GET BETTER FOR KIDS AS A RESULT OF ALL THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE. AND AND I DON'T THINK THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EVEN BEFORE CHARTERS. WITH A TO PLACE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO FAIL AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS. AND AND SO I I I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH IN THE LACK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL AND I'M NOT A LOT OF OVERSIGHT THAT. THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING AND I DON'T.% I DON'T EVEN AYE LESSER TO SEE THE OVERSIGHT COMING IN THIS AND I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEEN SOMETHING IN ALL OF THIS THAT REALLY MADE A COMMITMENT. OF OVERSIGHT AND OUTCOMES FOR KIDS WHO ARE POOR. BUT IF WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY AND PUTTING IT BACK INTO AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL PIECE ISN'T CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH WE SHOULD BE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT AT THIS POINT FOR A LOT OF KIDS AND WE'RE YOUR FORTUNE IN SACRAMENTO TO THE FOURTEEN SCHOOLS. BUT THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS UP AND DOWN THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE DON'T SEEM TO BE. AGGRESSIVELY DEALING WITH THAT WE SEEM TO DEAL MORE WITH -- FINANCES AND MANAGEMENT AND ALL THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE KNOW WHEN SCHOOLS HAVE DONE EXTREMELY WELL FINANCIALLY. BLACK AND BROWN HE'S STILL FAIL. WHEN THEY LOST MONEY BLACK AND BROWN KIDS STILL FAIL? SO EVEN AS WE DO THIS WE HAVEN'T MADE A COMMITMENT TO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND ATTACHING IT IN SOME WAY. THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO GET BETTER FOR OUR KIDS I THINK THOSE ON THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE TO COMMIT OURSELVES AFTER THESE THREE BILLS. AND ALL THE OTHER ONES WE SEE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS KNOWLEDGE TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUT WHAT ACT WHERE I KIDS FLEEING WHAT A PAN STILL SO DESPERATE. UP I MEAN IT. I UNDERSTAND IT THE WORST YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE DECISIONS PARENTS HAVE TO MAKE ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THEIR KIDS THESE THESE FOLKS A DESPERATE. AND AND SO AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE BUT WE SAT BACK AND KIND OF ALLOW THE CHARTER TEAM TO GO UP AND DOWN TO GIVE WEEKLY WAGGLE YOU. GET SOME THINGS OF THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE THAT WE GET TO TOSS OUT AND WE'VE HAD TO DRESS. BUT I'M HOPING AT SOME POINT THAT THOSE WERE PUT FORTH THESE THREE FOUR BILLS. THAT WOULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE CHARTERS ALSO WE'LL TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET SOME ACCOUNTABILITY? FOR PERFORMANCE INTEREST IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST CLAMP DOWN THIS AND THINK EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY BECAUSE IT WILL NOT. AND SO I HOPE THAT BECOMES A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE REALLY START TALKING ABOUT. PERFORMANCE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR OUR KIDS FOR EVERY KID IN CALIFORNIA TO GROW AND TO THRIVE. AND IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY PUSH OUR FOLKS OUT AGAIN. OUT OF FRUSTRATION. AND MY FEAR IS THAT THEY WILL GO INTO THE VOUCHER SITUATION THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO. AND I CHAIRED THE VOUCHER NO ONE AS I TOLD YOU THE NO ONE THOUGHT TO COMMITTEE AND I STILL WANTED TO THIS DAY IF I DID THE RIGHT THING. BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME ASSURANCES MADE AS TO WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN OUR SCHOOLS. IF WE DEFEATED VOUCHERS AND THAT INSURANCE WAS NOT LIVED UP TO FOR ME IN TERMS WITH PEOPLE SHORT ME WHEN I TOOK THAT CHARGE TO DO THAT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT CONVERSATION WILL RISE TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PERFORMANCE. IN ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS SO THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND AND AND BOTH RUNNING TO CHART IS IS JUST A SYMPTOM. OF OUTCOME OF OF WHAT WE SEE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUE WHICH IS EVERY SCHOOL IN THIS STATE SHOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL SO THE PARENT CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET AND PUT THEIR KID IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND FEEL THAT'S A GOOD THING AND AS A GRANDMOTHER YOU KNOW I MY DAUGHTER PAYS ALMOST FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR HER TWO KIDS GO TO SCHOOL. THAT IS CRIMINAL YOU KNOW THAT IS CRIMINAL AND SHE LIVES IN A DECENT NEIGHBORHOOD BUT THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT PERFORMING AT THE LEVEL THAT SHE THINKS IS IMPORTANT. SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THAT IS A STATEMENT ABOUT. PEOPLE CRYING OUT FOR HELP AND I'M HOPING THAT ONCE WE DO ALL THIS MISCEGENATION EVERYONE DO WITH THESE THREE BILLS. THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE CRYING OUT FOR A QUALITY SCHOOL IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE MUST COMMIT OURSELVES TO THAT. OTHERWISE THEY WILL FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN DUPED AGAIN. GREAT -- SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT -- MISTER MCCARTY. YOU MAY -- CLOSE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO PROVISIONS OF EMOTION. THE BILL WILL AS THE CALLER SECOND MIGHT MISS SMITH. UP YOU MAY CLOSE. YEAH I THINK THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE THINK IT THIS IS A A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE. IT'S A LOT OF GRAY BETWEEN AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE AS YOU SAID IN YOUR MEASURE AND ARE MEASURE TO WORK WITH THAT. WITH THOSE SITES YOU KNOW THIS IS THE REALITY WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOUR HOURS YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HEARD ONE TO FOUR HOURS. HOWEVER WOEFULLY UNDER FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS. RIGHT. FORTY FIRST THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE FUNDING THAT'S A DISGRACE WE PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW. IF WE WERE TWENTY FIFTH IN THE NATION -- FIT IN THE NATION ARE TENTH IN FUNDING OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION INCLUDING OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE X. ON UNBELIEVABLE PRESSURE ON OUR FINANCIAL -- WHERE WITH ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THAT MEANS EIGHT IN SCHOOLS INCREASE CLASS SIZES DON'T HAVE THE IN RICHMOND THAT THE SPORTS THE MATH? AND ON THE MAP THE SPORTS THE MUSIC THE DR SO THAT TOO SOMETIMES A MATHIS DOCTOR WHERE I WAS JUST POINTING OUT. AND YOU KNOW MONEY IS NOT THE ANSWER TO ALL OF OUR WILLOWS BUT I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT WE NEED. pTRACK ON BUT THIS ISN'T IS THAT NECESSARY PIECE. I THINK IT'S A FAIR PERSPECTIVE. HEARING WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE. AND WITH THAT HAS BEGUN. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY THINK YOU'RE POINTING OUT THE FUNNY ISSUE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE WITH REGARD TO THAT AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES OF ACTUALLY INCREASE THEIR LOCAL TAXES TO SUPPORT THEIR SCHOOLS. NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE THAT OPTION OR HAVE BEEN ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET THAT PASSED BUT THAT SHOWS YOU THE DESPAIR NESS OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THANK YOU -- WITH THAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE REAL QUICK MISTER MCCARTY YOU DO IT ON A MICROPHONE YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. YES I SAID AT THE BEGINNING ALSO. THE MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN AND APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NO KALRA. KALRA AYE MCCARTY. I SMITH SMITH I WEBER. WEBER NOT VOTING. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES ITIS OUT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE IT QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT -- EIGHTY SEVEN ELEVEN HAS BEEN PULLED AS HAS AB EIGHT SEVEN FIVE THOSE OF BOTH AND PULL FROM TWO NIGHTS AGENDA. IT WAS TODAY NOW IT'S TIME. I'M SORRY NEXT NEXT TO FILE ITEMS THIRTY ONE FILE ITEM THIRTY ONE AND THIS IS. FIFTEEN OH SEVEN BY MISS SMITH -- YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY WITH AB FIFTEEN OR SEVEN MISS SMITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO OPEN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH CLARIFY PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS AND INCREASE TRANSPARENCY FOR SCHOOLS. AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN CONTINUES THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK IN INCREASING CHARTER TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL INCREASES LOCAL CONTROL BY ELIMINATING LOOPHOLES IN CURRENT CHARTER LAW WHICH ALLOW CHARTER SCHOOLS TO OPERATE DISTRICT. THIS BILL RESTORES THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES AND CLARIFIES THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF THE DULY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS AND THEIR ROLES IN PUBLIC OVERSIGHT. MY STAFF AND I PROVIDED RECENT LA TIMES AND CAL MATTERS ARTICLES TO YOU FRAMING OUT OF DISTRICT CHARTER AUTHORIZATION ABUSES. THE ISSUE THAT AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN SEEKS TO ADDRESS AND IS NOW BEEN A CONSISTENT AN ONGOING CHALLENGE LEAVING IMPACTED ELLIE IS NO RECOURSE OTHER THAN COSTLY LITIGATION. ELEAZAR HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS BUT THAT SUCCESS IS BUILT OFF TRUST FROM THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE ALLEY A AND THE COMMUNITY IMPACTED BY IT. REST IS BUILT OFF MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT WHICH IS NOT PRACTICABLE IF ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE SCHOOL IN YOUR BACKYARD. THIS WAS THE CASE DURING MY TENURE ON THE NEW HALL SCHOOL BOARD. WE DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS NORTH ALREADY TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT. ON A SCHOOL. THERE WAS AUTHORIZED BY ANOTHER DISTRICT BUT PHYSICALLY LOCATED WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS BOUNDARIES IN FACT ACROSS THE STREET FROM OUR DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS. WE COULD NOT DO ARE DULY ELECTED JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE STUDENTS. IN THE SCHOOL NOR COULD WE ADVOCATE TO MITIGATE ANY FACTORS TO DECREASE THE IMPACT TO THE SCHOOL AND ITS SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. AS A CAL MATTERS ARTICLE INDICATES THE CHARTER IN MY DISTRICTS CASE CLOSED IN A FEW SHORT YEARS DUE TO WOEFULLY MISMANAGED FINANCES THROUGH THEIR CMO. AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED BY THE MULTIPLE ELLIE ETS WHO WOULD CAREFULLY VETTED AND DENIED THEIR ORIGINAL PETITION. THE AUTHORIZED OR IN THIS CASE WAS A SMALL RURAL DISTRICT IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS DUE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT. AND THIS IS OCCURRING IN DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE LOOPHOLE IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTION LITERALLY SETS UP A PERVERSE SET A FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR STRUGGLING ELLIE ETS IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT NOT ONLY WITH THE INTENT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT BUT WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ADEQUATELY FUND ALL DISTRICTS. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT AS THE COST OF OPERATION OFTEN DON'T DIMINISH IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO DIMINISHMENT OF ADA. HOWEVER AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE TOOLS AND POWER TO BEST USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR OUR COMMUNITY IN CHILDREN. AND FOR THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO DO. PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN THEIR STATUTORY JURISDICTION. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OUR GUILD GARBARINO MOJICA SUPERINTENDENT OF PLASTER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MARK WINGER MY FORMER SUPERINTENDENT IN THE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NEW LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS GAIL GARBARINO MOJICA AND I'M THE PLASTER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS WE HAVE HAD A NEW NUMEROUS AMOUNTS. OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WERE LOCATING IN OTHER DISTRICTS THAT WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY THEM. WE ARE AS A COUNTY OF ABOUT SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND KIDS SIXTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TWENTY ONE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AT ONE POINT WE HAD SIX CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WERE OPERATING OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTHORIZES BOUNDARIES. BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCE THESE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE COME ACROSS TO TRANSIT I FIND TROUBLING WHEN WE HAVE A CHARTER SCHOOL THAT RELOCATES OUTSIDE AN AUTHOR RISERS BORDERS. THE FIRST ONE HAPPENS IS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD GOVERNMENT SYSTEM A LOCAL CONTROL SYSTEM. WE HAVE A VERY LARGE CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S LOCATED IN ROSEVILLE. AND THERE WERE SOME INGRESS EGRESS ISSUES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE BUSINESS IN THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE TAKING THEIR CONCERNS TO THEIR LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS THEIR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. YOUR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS THERE CITY GOVERNMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T THE CASE THEY WERE AUTHORIZED BY A TOWN THAT WAS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AWAY. FROM THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE A TOWN THAT HAD A SCHOOL BOARD THAT DID NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE THE SCHOOL BOARD OR THE CAST CITY GOVERNMENT. IT RESULTED IN MANY CONSTITUENTS BEING VERY CONFUSED AS TO HOW THEY CAN CONFIRM CONVEY THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING THE INGRESS AND EGRESS ISSUES. THE SECOND ISSUES THAT I'VE COME ACROSS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS THE I DO THE THE PARTICIPATION OF MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS SEEKING A SMALL AUTHORIZED -- SUCH AS ONE OF MY SMALLEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY LOCATED IN THE FOOTHILLS. THEY ARE SMALL. A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEIR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF STAFF TO CONDUCT A IN DEPTH HIGH QUALITY REVIEW. AS SOON AS SUCH THEY HAVE AUTHORIZED MANY LARGE CHARTER SCHOOLS SOME OF WHICH THREE OF THEM ARE LOCATED IN TAHOE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS AWAY FROM THEIR CURRENT AUTHORIZED -- SO IF YOU DRIVE UP HIGHWAY EIGHTY YOU HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH SIX OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEFORE YOU GET TO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. WHAT IS THE SERBS WHAT HAS RESULTED IS THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT THAT THE SMALL RULE SCHOOL DISTRICT HOUSE FOR THESE CHARTERS I HAVE WITH WITNESSED IT MYSELF? THE FACT THAT THIS CHARTERS THIS DISTRICT DOESN'T EVEN MEET THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN LONG WHEN IT COMES TO OVERSIGHT. SO I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS AND I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THOSE IN DEPTH IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS LATER. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MARK WHERE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT NEW HALL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN I'M GONNA TELL YOU ARE DISTRICTS STORY SO TO A LITTLE MICROCOSM OF WHAT YOU JUST HEARD -- WE REJECTED A PETITION FROM THE ALBERT EINSTEIN A KIA CAN ME IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN DUE TO FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY WERE MAKING THAT WE KNEW WERE WRONG AND THEIR ABILITY TO OR THEIR LACK OF ABILITY. TO NOT DELIVER PROGRAM FOR OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS IN THE DISTRICT. THEIR PETITION WAS ALSO REJECTED BY OUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS SAUGUS SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND REJECTED BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF EDUCATION ON APPEAL FROM THE SAUGUS DISTRICT AND REJECTED. BY FOUR OTHER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE LOS ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTIES. AT AROUND A PARALLEL TRACK IN ON TWO THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ACTON I WOULD ALSO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS -- IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENT DISTRICT AT THAT TIME ABOUT TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM US. AND THEY WERE NEGATIVELY CERTIFIED BY LA COUNTY THEY COULDN'T MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN THE COMING YEARS -- THEIR BOARD DECIDED THAT THE WAY THEY WERE GOING TO PROVE THIS WAS BY APPROVING MULTIPLE CHARTERS AND I HAVE THE SLIDE PRESENTATION FROM THE BOARD -- MEETING AT THAT TIME MULTIPLE CHARTERS AND THEY WOULD GENERATE ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND SOLVE THEIR FISCAL PROBLEMS -- SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT. ACT AND I WOULD ALSO BE AND THE EINSTEIN CHARTER FOUND EACH OTHER AND ACT AND THEY'LL SEE APPROVED THERE -- PETITION AND THE PETITION TALK ABOUT SERVING THE STUDENTS OF THE ACT AND I WOULD ALSO A SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT THE IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THERE WAS NO ROOM IN THE DISTRICT AND THEY HAVE TO MOVE ELSEWHERE -- AND AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO SAW ON THE SMALL DISTRICTS WAS THEY MANUFACTURE THE ARGUMENT TO FIT THE LOOPHOLE THAT THERE'S NO ROOM IN THE DISTRICTS ARE SMALL DISTRICT -- SO THE THEY WANT TO MOVE TO SANTA CLARITA AND THEY TRIEDAND THEY FAILED TO OPEN. BUT THEY DID OPEN THAT FIRST YEAR THEY OPENED AN ABANDONED SCHOOL IN ACT AND I WOULD ALSO. GOING TO DEFINE THEIR OWN CLAIM OF NOT HAVING SPACE A YEAR LATER -- PRIVATE SCHOOL CAME ON THE MARKET IN SANTA CLARITA IN THE NEW HOUSE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY MOVED INTO THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL AND OPENED NOT TO SERVE THE STUDENTS OF BACKING OUT OF THE I WOULD ALSO BUT TO SERVE. THE SCHOOLS IN SANTA CLARITA. WE HAD ONE PETITION. IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL LAW ONE PETITION WE DENIED IT. WE FOLLOW THE LAW WE DID NOT IT ON SIGNIFICANT FOR SIGNIFICANT REASONS AND IF THAT SCHOOL WAS OPERATING IN OUR DISTRICT. AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT THAT WE ARE OVERSIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT APPLY A FEW YEARS INTO THEIR RUN -- FIFTH MAC CONDUCTED AN EXTRA EXTRAORDINARY HOT IT. AND FOUND ALL KINDS OF FISCAL MISMANAGEMENT A COMPLETE LACK OF PAPERWORK IN A LOT OF CASES THEY COULDN'T PROVE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING CRIMINAL GOING ON BECAUSE A CONFINED ENOUGH RECORDS TO DO THAT. AND NEW -- SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS COMPLETELY UNABLE. TO OVERSEE THAT CHARTER OPERATING OUR DISTRICT I THINK MATT HAD SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND AFTER NOT WITH ALL STATE I COMPETING INTERESTS HERE DIDN'T THEY DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT THICK MAT. AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH SAID THEY DROVE THEMSELVES INTO THE GROUND EVENTUALLY AND CLOSE -- ANY AS YOU KNOW THIS WAS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE A DOCTOR WEBER YOU KNOW TWELFTH BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED WITH THE SAME GROUP -- IT'S HAPPENED ACROSS THE STATE THE COMMON THEME IS SMALL FISCALLY DISTRESSED UNITS MANUFACTURING THIS NO SPACE SOLUTION. TO EXPLOIT THIS LOOPHOLE IN THE WHAT. AND HOW I FEEL STRONGLY A LOCAL LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS OF WE'VE HEARD ALL DAY TODAY. HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS INCLUDING CHARTERS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRICTS. THE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS OTHER DISTRICTS TO VIOLATE THAT WHOLE CONCEPT AND AND THE SOVEREIGNTY OF OTHER DISTRICTS. AND IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND I DON'T SEE THIS CONVERSELY IF THAT LOOPHOLE ISN'T CLOSED THAT'S SENDING A SIGNAL THAT THIS UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE ALLOWING IT TO GO ON SO COURSE I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IF YOU KNOW SO.

HI MY NAME IS THE RANDY GUESS AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN EDUCATION AS A TEACHER AND NOW AS A COUNSELOR. FOR THE PAST TWENTY THREE YEARS. I MADE THE SWITCH FROM WORKING IN A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL ELEVEN YEARS AGO WHEN I BEGAN WORKING AT A SITE BASED CHARTER SCHOOL. BECAUSE I WAS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH A POPULATION OF STUDENTS IN WHICH I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I HAVE DECIDED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE OF THE THREAT THAT AB FIFTY NO SEVEN PRESENTS TO THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS. THAT ATTEND OUR SITE. STUDENTS THAT HAVE COME TO OUR SITE. ARE THE STUDENTS. THAT COME TO US FOR VARIOUS REASONS [inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE. STUDENTS WITH DEPRESSION. ANXIETY. VICTIMS OF BULLYING. STUDENTS THAT PERHAPS ARE LOOKING TO START THEIR CAREER. AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL EARLY. WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM A FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE? AND A SMALL CLASS INSTRUCTION. STUDENTS WHO HAVE BIBLE FORCE OR I. E. P.'S WHO ARE STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY. AT OUR SITE STUDENTS CAN ENROLL IN SMALL CLASSES. THAT ARE NO BIGGER THAN. FIVE AND HAVE THE BENEFITS OF TRUE DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION. I CAN BE TRULY ENGAGED. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DETRIMENTAL IT WOULD BE TO THESE STUDENTS. LIVES IF THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IF AB FIFTEEN OH SEVEN PASSES. IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE STUDENTS. WHO HAVE FOUND SUCCESS IN OUR BACK OF BILL SITE BASED PROGRAM? WILL THEY BE FORCED TO GO BACK TO THE PROGRAM. AT THEIR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL SITE. THAT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS. WILL THEIR I EP GOALS. BE MAD AT THE RICH AT THE TRADITIONAL SITE. OR WHERE OR WILL THEY JUST SIMPLY DROP OUT. KNOWING THAT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FAILED THEM. AND I LEAVE THAT QUESTION FOR YOU TO PONDER. I KNOW. THAT OUR SITE PROGRAM MAKES A DIFFERENCE EVERY DAY. PERHAPS YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST ELEVEN YEARS WITH THE STUDENTS THAT I WORK WITH. AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT OUR ORGANIZATION. ATTEMPTED TO GET CHARTER APPROVED BY OUR LOCAL DISTRICT. AND WE WERE DENIED TWICE. DESPITE THE CLEAR STUDENT NEED. A COMMUNITY DESIRE IN THAT DISTRICT FOR OUR PROGRAM. I KNOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK THAT WE DO EVERY DAY. HOW CAN ANY EDUCATOR OR LEADER DENY A STUDENT A SCHOOL LARA PROGRAM OF CHOICE? IF THEIR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DID NOT WORK FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. AND AT THE END OF MY SPEECH HERE. I WANT TO JUST CONVEY THAT I WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR ALL STUDENTS. HELLO AND GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS DRIVING SPORTS AND I'M SIXTEEN AND I'M A JUNIOR AT US AND I'M A STUDENT AT RIO VALLEY. CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW. GOING TO CHARTER SCHOOL CHANGING FOR THE BETTER AND HOME EDUCATIONAL ON WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO FIRST OFF I WASN'T ALWAYS IN A CHARTER SCHOOL I WAS ALWAYS INTRODUCTION ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. I WENT TO TRADITIONAL HIGH SCHOOLS I WILL FOLLOW FOR PLAN AND I FELT LIKE EVERY SCHOOL THAT I WENT TO DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT I NEEDED THAT EXTRA AN INDIVIDUAL HELP. FROM TEACHERS I NEVER GOT THAT AND THAT'S WHY I WAS FEELING MOSTLY ALL MY CLASSES AND I'M GETTING ANYTHING DONE. AND I WAS FALLING BEHIND IN A LOT AND EVERYTHING AND SO I WENT TO THE CHARTER SYSTEM AND IT WAS THE BEST THING I EVER DID. I WENT IN AND I FEEL LIKE I REALLY GOT A SECOND CHANCE AT SCHOOLING. MY FIVE OH FOR PRIME WAS RESPECTED AND I GOT THE INDIVIDUAL HELP I NEEDED AND I FELT SO MUCH BETTER AND MORE CONFIDENT IN MY FUTURE AND THAT I WAS GOING TO GRADUATE ON TIME. AND IT IS GOOD SHOT DOWN EVERYONE INCLUDING ME WILL BE PUSHED BACK INTO THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING WILL NOT WILL BE THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE. AND I HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT'S NOT THE BEST THING FOR ME. BECAUSE THEN THERE GOES MY HOPE FOR PLAN AND MY GRADES ARE GONNA SLIP AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT WE AS KIDS AND ASSISTANCE ON DESERVED COVER SCHOOL SHUT DOWN WE DESERVE A GREAT EDUCATION AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE.

ONE HELLO MY NAME IS ANA I AM AN ARTIST. AND I AM A MOM AND POP AND AYE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK BEHIND THE RAIL -- FOR QUESTIONS FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I JUST WANTED. I THINK. MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD CLARIFY I DON'T THINK THIS BILLS AIMED AT H ANY FASHION AS IF WE'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT SEEKING. TO STOP PEOPLE FROM HOME SCHOOLING ARE RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER TERRY PRETTY THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THAT SO -- WE ACTUALLY ARE PLANNING ON WORKING ON ONE ADDITIONAL SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD GRANDFATHER IN EXISTING CHARTERS AND THAT MAY BE WHAT SOME OF THIS OPPOSITION IS SPEAKING TO OF THEIR CHOOSING A HOMESCHOOL OPTION NOW THAT. THAT MAY HAVE PRIOR BEEN LOCATED OUTSIDE OF A DISTRICT WE ARE GOING -- TO SEEK TO GO AHEAD AND GRANDFATHER THOSE SO THAT WILL BE ACCOMMODATED I'M AND WE ALSO PLAN ON ADDING FLEXIBILITY RICK REGARDING -- OPERATIONS AND CITING AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES AS WE RECENTLY SIGNED PARADISE SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR CHARTER TO GO AHEAD AND AND LOCATE OUTSIDE OF ITS BOUNDARY -- IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION SO WE ARE GONNA BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS BUT YOU KNOW TO FURTHER CLARIFY AND AND IN SEPARATION FROM THE PRIOR. FIFTEEN HUNDRED SERIES OF BILLS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED THIS HAS BEEN A VEXING PROBLEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AN INITIAL VERSION OF THIS BILL WAS AUTHORED BY SENATOR PRACTICE FAN FRIEND POWERFULLY IT WAS -- SB TWELVE SIXTY THREE IT CLEARED BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN BECAUSE HAD IT BEEN WE COULD HAVE STOP TO THOSE ABUSES. YEARS AGO AND WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY BUT THE ONGOING CHALLENGE REMAINS AND YOU KNOW I SAY ON BEHALF OF THE THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT THAT WENT THROUGH THIS ONE CHALLENGE WITH THIS. ONE AUTHORIZED -- AND AND ONE BAD ACTOR IN THE CHARTER SPACE WE SPENT WELL IN EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS. IN NOT ONLY VETTING THIS CHARTER PETITION BY HIRING ACCOUNTANTS AND BY HIRING CONSULTANTS TO REVIEW THEIR ACADEMIC PLAN BUT ALSO IN WHAT WE SPENT IN LEGAL COSTS. IT STRAINED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY THE CHARTER AS A LOCATED WITHIN OUR BOUNDARIES WERE NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS GOOD NEIGHBORS THERE WERE TRAFFIC ISSUES. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WERE CONCERNS WHEN THE SCHOOL DID CLOSE DUE TO THAT FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT SO. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THIS IS A GOOD GOVERNANCE BILL THAT IS LONG -- OVER DOOM AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. GREAT THANK YOU. I AGREE THAT IT IS LONG OVERDUE AND I JUST. I'LL SAY IT FOR YOU BUT YOU SAID IT YOU'RE NOT SEEKING TO STOP THEM FROM HOME SCHOOLING YOUR CHILDREN. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM BUT IT IS NOT TRUE. IT IS NOT TRUE IF YOU HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN LED DOWN THE WRONG PATH SO WITH THAT -- THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS MANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND ARE THERE ANY TINO COMMENTS MR KILEY THANK YOU. OUR FIRST ONE THANK EVERYONE WHO CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY -- I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY -- AND BUT IT'S SO SO IMPORTANT THAT THE AUTHORS THESE BILLS CONCEALED UNDER PACKED UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT'LL HAVE ON YOU SO I THINK SEVERAL IT CAME OUT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBERS WHAT I DO JUST HAVE A FEW PAN AYE AYE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND GOOD EVENING I THINK FOR AN EVENING NOW -- BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU WERE TAKEN AND LOOKING AMENDMENT YOU TAKE -- THAT WOULD. GRANDFATHER IN RESOURCE CENTERS THAT ARE -- CURRENTLY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT -- SO IT ALSO GRANT YOU GRANDFATHER IN. RESOURCE CENTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT WHETHER THOSE ARE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY AND THE DISTRICT OP RESIN OR WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY IS THAT RIGHT. THE FOR THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXISTING WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE DEFINITIONS LOOK LIKE WE WE PLAN ON WORKING ON WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS OUR ALLIES IN MAKING SURE WE'VE GOT SOME CLARITY ON THAT. OKAY THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR THANK YOU ON AND SO I I THINK I I FOR YOUR ARGUMENT AS FAR AS WHY YOU DON'T WANT -- RESOURCE CENTERS OPERATING OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT THEIR AUTHORIZED MISTER NORM BUT WHAT IF THERE'S EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THERE ARE FACILITIES IN VAIL AVAILABLE WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AUTHORIZED INDUSTRY WITH THE BILL ALSO PROHIBIT THAT. WELL YEAH I MEAN UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST ABUSES BEEN RIGHT IS THAT IS THAT LITERALLY THAT ASPECT OF THIS LOOPHOLE WAS WHAT'S BEEN EXPLOITED -- AND YOU KNOW THEY DID FOR TO GO INTO A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT IN NEIGHBORING COUNTY AND SAY WELL THERE ARE FACILITIES AVAILABLE -- AND SO YEAH UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH ABUSE IT WILL I THINK WE'RE AT KNOW NOW I'M AND NUMBER OF THESE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE REPRESENTING -- PLACES YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN IF IT'S A RESOURCE CENTER NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND A LOCATION IN A STRIP MALL LOCATION AND BUSINESS CENTER THAT KIND OF THING SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AROUND THE KIND OF SPACES ON THAT THEY'D BE. ABLE TO BE ACCOMMODATED IN DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK -- TO MAYBE -- MORE STRICTLY RAIN IN WHAT YOU PERCEIVE TO BE THE ABUSES WITHOUT AT WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR SOME -- OPTION OF LOCATING OUT OF DISTRICT EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WELL I MEAN I WOULD HOPE SO BUT AGAIN THIS IS CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING ON WITH AND PRIOR TO HIS TENURE -- WITH THAT YOU KNOW CHARTER SCHOOLS FOLKS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I MEAN WE'VE ASKED AND AND LITERALLY THE ONLY RECOURSE MY DISTRICT WAS LEFT WITH WAS LITIGATION. WE ASKED WE DID WE WENT TO THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT AND ASK THEM NOT TO AUTHORIZE WE ASK HIM TO RECONSIDER -- AND IN MANY CASES THERE THERE IS A LAB LEVEL OF KIND OF ABSTINENCE AROUND THIS MATTER AND THAT THAT HASN'T REALLY GOTTEN US TO A GOOD PLACE AND AND IS IS SIMPLY IS A MATTER OF GOOD GOVERNANCE I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF YOU WILL. YOU KNOW IT THE SCHOOL BOARD IS A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND A CITY IS A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE CITY ABOUT GROW SAID TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WELL WE NEED MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WE DON'T KNOW PLACE TO LOCATED WITHIN OUR CITY SO WE'RE BUILDING A NEW POLICE DEPARTMENT. IN YOUR CITY. BUT YOU HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OVER IT YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE COMINGS OR GOINGS OF LOGISTICS OR THE TRAFFIC AROUND IT I DON'T THINK VERY MANY OF US WHO CARE ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD. SUPPORT THAT RIGHT AND SO WE NEED TO RESTORE THIS IDEA OF THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF A SCHOOL BOARD AND THAT'S WHAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CRAFTED THIS IN A WAY. AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WAS ON BOARD BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO DO THIS WORK. TO TRY TO HELP THE STATE MANAGE THESE REALLY PRECIOUS RESOURCES ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY AUTHORIZE AND REPRESENT SO I FEEL LIKE THE TIME IS NOW TO FOR ITS TO A LEASE CLOSE THE CHAPTER ON THIS MATTER THAT WE KNOW WE CAN GET TO NOW. IN AND I I I JUST WANTED TO THINK THAT -- THE AUTHOR AS WELL FOR GREEN TO TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS AND MISTER COLLEY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS I WILL SAY -- JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT. THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR OVERSIGHT OF AUTHORIZES PARTICULARLY. SMALL AUTHORIZES AUTHORIZES THAT MIGHT AUTHORIZED CHARTERS THAT WITH A WITH AN ENROLLMENT THAT'S LARGER THAN THEIR OWN -- WHICH SHOULD INVITE SOME STREET SCRUTINY BY SOME. HIGHER AUTHORITY RIGHT I'M GONNA REMEMBER YOU JUST SAID THAT WELL LET'S LET'S I DON'T HEAR THAT REALLY. GOT IT DONE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WERE SAYING I KNOW I HONESTLY I DO APPRECIATE YEAH. WELL INTO THE POINT WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL AND SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THAT NEED AS WELL WE HAVE STRUGGLING RURAL DISTRICTS IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHOSE COSTS OF OPERATION DON'T CHANGE NECESSARILY IN RELATION TO EIGHTY A DIMINISHMENT RIGHT. THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON THEY HAVE TO KEEP A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STAFF BASED ON STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE WE'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS A FUNDING CHALLENGE ON OUR IN TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT IS A PIECE OF THIS OVERALL CONVERSATION AS WELL. YEAH AND THE LAST THING IS THAT THERE'S A SEPARATE VERSION OF THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE RESOURCE CENTERS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE AUTHORIZING DISTRICT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE OF THEM. YEAH WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. WELL WE'RE HOPING THAT ONE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT RIGHT I MEAN WHAT WE KIND OF WANT TO NOT HAVE TO DO IS BE PLAYING THE GO FOR GAME AS RESOURCE CENTERS POP UP ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S EASIER FOR AN AUTHORIZED OR TO HAVE OVERSIGHT ON AND MAINTAIN YOU NO. ISSUES WITH QUALITY AND SAFETY AT THAT ONE RESOURCE CENTER SAYS IT'S A MATTER AGAIN OF A LINE OF SIGHT AND EFFECTIVE AUTHORIZATION I CAN SEE HOW MAYBEIT THAT YOU KNOW. MIGHT MAKE SOME SENSE FOR REALLY COMPACT DISTRICT WHEN YOU LOOK AT RURAL AREAS THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING LARGE AMOUNTS OF TERRITORY POTENTIALLY FOR ONE DISTRICT AND SO YOU FEEL CAN ONLY HAVE ONE THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF KIDS WHO. GOT TO DRIVE A LONG WAY JUST TO GET THERE SO LET ME ONE WELL WHICH IS ALSO A CHALLENGE FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS RIGHT IN IN AREAS LIKE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT CERTAINLY SOME A PLACE WE CAN GO. IN THE FUTURE. SO YOU'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT POTENTIALLY -- MODIFYING THAT PROVISION TO ALLOW FOR MORE THAN ONE RESOURCE CENTER WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE NOT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE I THINK THIS LEVEL OF CLARITY AND SPECIFICITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE AND HOW PEOPLE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. BUT GOING FORWARD WITH BOTH. TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS OF CHOICE I THINK WE WANT TO BE LOOKING AT ACCESS AND DISTANCE RELATIVE TO WHERE FOLKS LIVE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS -- YOU MAY. CLOSE THE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. MISTER KALRA MOVES MISTER MCCARTY SECONDS -- YOU MAY CLOSE.

SABRINA PEERS AND AND HER HUSBAND RODRIGUEZ PEERS ARE HERE TO SPEAK -- THEY ARE THE WHOLE REASON FOR THIS BILL -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THEM. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS SABRINA PIERCE AND I AM THE MOTHER OF ALEX PIERCE. MY BLONDE HAIR BLUE EYED FRECKLE FACED SWEET BOYS WOULD BE WITH HIS FAMILY RIGHT NOW. FIDGETING IN HIS SEAT SMILING AND JOKING AROUND WITH US IF SOMEONE AT THE SCHOOL ANYONE HAD PERFORMED CPR ON MY SON. IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALEX WAS A SEVENTH GRADE STUDENT SWIMMING AT A SCHOOL SPONSORED PARTY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL POOL WITH HIS CLASSMATES WHEN HE SLIPPED UNDER THE WATER WHILE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MARIETTA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT STAFF AND PERSONAL. IT WASN'T THE SCHOOL DISTRICT STAFF PERSONNEL. OR EVEN THE LIFEGUARDS THAT CAME TO MY SON'S IMMEDIATE RESCUE IT WAS HIS MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSMATES THAT PULLED HIM FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL. AND DELIVERED HIM TO LIFEGUARDS WHO MISSY VALUE WAITED HIS TREATMENT AND PLACE THEM ON A FLOATING BACKBOARD IN THE POLL WITHOUT CHECKING HIS AIRWAY HIS BREATHING HIS CIRCULATION OR REMOVING HIM FROM THE POOL TO ADMINISTER CPR. MY SON WAS ONLY UNDER WATER FOR TWO MINUTES. BUT WAS WITHOUT OXYGEN FOR NINE MINUTES. ONLY ONE TEACHER AT THE POOL PARTY WAS CPR CERTIFIED HE CLAIMED HE WAS NOT WORKING AT THIS TIME. IF SOMEONE ANYONE HAD PERFORM CPR AND ALEX HE WOULD BE WITH US TODAY TO SHARE HIS STORY OF SURVIVAL AND HE WOULD CELEBRATE HIS SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN AUGUST. INSTEAD I STAND BEFORE YOU NOW IS A MOTHER WITH THE SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY AND AS AN ADVOCATE FOR THE MILLIONS OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN LIKE ALEX. WHOSE PARENTS AND TRUST THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILD TO THEIR SCHOOL. SHOULDN'T SCHOOL DISTRICT STOCK AND PERSONAL BE EQUIPPED WITH ALL THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THAT CHILD AND EVEN SAVE A CHILD'S LIFE IN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. CHILDREN ARE IN SCHOOL FOR MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND EIGHTY SIX HOURS EACH SCHOOL YEAR THEY SPEND MORE TIME IN SCHOOL AND THEY DO IN THEIR OWN HOME. CPR IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOL. IN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY BOTH ON AN OFF CAMPUS WHAT IF YOUR CHILD HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK. ON A SCHOOL FIELD TRIP OR HEART FAILURE RECESS OR DROWNED AT A SCHOOL SPONSORED SWIM PARTY LIKE MY ALEX. I SERVED SEVENTEEN YEARS IN THE NAVY AND MY HUSBAND SERVE. NINE BOTH OF US THOUGHT THAT WHILE WE WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE SAFE AND SOUND IN SCHOOL. NO PARENT SHOULD GET A PHONE CALL SAYING THAT YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER IS ON THEIR WAY TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT. AT SCHOOL AND THEY DON'T KNOW IF HE OR SHE IS GOING TO MAKE IT. IT'S A NIGHTMARE AND NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW HOW BROKEN WE FEEL UNLESS THEY'VE LOST A CHILD THEMSELVES. AS A PARENT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD THE STEEP AT SCHOOL AND THE STAFF SUPERVISING YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER KNOWS WHAT TO DO WHEN A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. HOW AND WHEN TO PERFORM CPR IS A BASIC LIFE SAVING SKILL? THAT SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF ALL ADULTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILD WHILE THE CHILD IS IN HIM OR HIS OR HER CARE. EVERY TIME OUR CHILDREN WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE NECK YOU WE HAD TO LEARN CPR AND FIRST AID. WHY IS THIS NOT A BASIC TEACHING REQUIREMENTS? MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THE BASIC SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN DURING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT SCHOOL AND CPR INSTRUCTION SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF ALL TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF. MY FAMILY AND I ARE STEADFAST IN OUR FIGHT TO ENSURE THAT NO PARENT OR FAMILY SUFFERS. THE LOSS OF A CHILD LIKE WE HAVE. WE ARE THANKFUL FOR ASSEMBLY ONE MELINDA'S IN DRAFTING THIS BILL AND FOR HER DEDICATION ADVOCATING FOR FAMILIES TO ENTRUST SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN. THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS -- DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SPEAK I THINK SHE PRETTY MUCH SAID IT ALL FOR EVERYONE I BELIEVE SO WE'RE SORRY EVERY TRAGEDY -- ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M ISABEL GARCIA WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE FIRST WANT TO EXTEND OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES AND SYMPATHIES TO MR MRS PIERCE. ON FOR THEIR AND THEIR PASSIONATE ADVOCACY WHICH WE SHARE. AND WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT. CPR IS AN IMPORTANT LIFE SKILL FOR EVERYONE. BUT IN PARTICULARLY FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WE'RE ONLY OPPOSING THE PROVISION IN THE BILL EVEN WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ON AT THAT PLACE IS AN UNRELATED ON CERTIFICATED STAFF. THAT BEFORE THEY RENEW THEIR CREDENTIALS THEY HAVE TO TAKE A CPR. CLASS AND WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY SCHOOL EMPLOYEE WHETHER THEY'RE CERTIFICATED OR NON CERTIFICATED. SHOULD HAVE -- DISTRICT PROVIDED CPR TRAINING. AND I CALLED A FEW LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS REQUIRE CPR TRAINING FOR THEIR SECRETARIES FOR THEIR COACHES AND THEIR HEALTH TEACHERS. OTHERS REQUIRED FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THEY'VE PROVIDED OR THEY REIMBURSE. SO WE ARE SAYING THAT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS. DISTRICTS SHOULD BE PROVIDING CPR FOR ALL THEIR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DISTRICT. THAT WERE THIS TRAGEDY HAPPENED THE POSTPONEMENT THEY ARE WE PROVIDING CPR FOR ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE'RE SAYING THAT'S WHERE THE BILL SHOULD BE AND WE'RE WE'RE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS. TO BRING THE BILL TO THAT PLACE AND NOT. PUT UP IN AN UNRELATED BEER YOU'RE IN THE CREDENTIALING PROCESS WHICH IS ALREADY COMPLICATED AS TO DO. AND WE'RE STAYING YOU'RE ONLY REACHING SOME OF THIS EMPLOYEES AND NOT ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES -- SO WE'RE SEEING THAT IT SHOULD BE IT FOR THE NON CERTIFICATED IN THE CERTIFICATED STAFF AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL GO AND AGAIN WE'RE HOPING. TO TO WORKING WITH YOU GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THAT PLACE AND IT'S FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEN OTHERS IN OPPOSITION BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. IT'S BEEN MOVED -- MISTER KALRA SECONDS. NOW MISMAS SECOND SECONDS -- WITH THAT -- MOTIONS TO PASSED YOU APPROPRIATIONS YOU MAY -- MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE -- THE OPPOSITION COMING FOR IN STATING WHAT THEIR ISSUE IS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- WE DISAGREE IN THAT -- THAT CPR IS JUST A LIFE SAVING SKILL NOT SOMETHING NECESSARY -- FOR EDUCATORS TO HAVE WE ON THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE WE DISAGREE WITH THAT AS A PARENT I DISAGREE WITH THAT -- IN THIS BILL THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING A SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM OFFERING CPR TO EVERYONE WITHIN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THAT SO -- THE CONCERN THAT THE OPPOSITION HAD THAT IT SHOULD BE OPEN TO EVERYONE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN OFFER THAT DIFFERENCE WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOSE.

YEAH ARE YOU LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DOING IT OTHER THAN JUST. I DON'T THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE TO TRY TO FIND BILINGUAL TEACHERS OBVIOUSLY. AND IF EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE A BILINGUAL TEACHER THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME GERMAN PROGRAMS WHERE. WHERE WHERE THERE'S A TRADE OFF EVERY EVERY WEEK IN SO THAT ONLY HALF OF THE STAFF AS THE HIT SPEAK GERMAN AND THEY DO EXTREMELY WELL? YOU KNOW SO THAT I THINK BECAUSE I THINK IT DELAYS US TO KEEP THINKING THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IT A A A TEACHER WHO SPEAKS TWO LANGUAGES IN EVERY CLASSROOM. AND DOG I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE THE EINSTEIN ACADEMY IN SAN DIEGO AND HAD SOME FRIENDS KIDS IN AND WHERE. EVERY OTHER WEEK ONE WEEK THEY WERE WITH THE GERMAN TEACHER THE NEXT WEEK THEY WERE WITH THE ENGLISH SPEAKING TEACHER AND THE REALITY WAS THAT IF THEY ONLY pGERMAN. AND THE KIDS ALL CAME UP BILINGUAL SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT NUMBER OF MODELS TO LOOK AT AND SO RATHER THAN SLOW US DOWN BECAUSE WE'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF IT.

IF THERE ARE NO OPTIONS TO TRANSFER WITHIN THE DISTRICT THIS MEASURE WILL ALSO ALLOW THE STUDENT WAS A VICTIM OF BULLYING TO APPLY FOR A TRANSFER OUTSIDE OF THE DISTRICT. WHICH THE SCHOOL OF ORIGIN CANNOT REJECT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE LAW. THAT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO TRANSFER WITHIN AND OUT OF THE DISTRICT. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A TRANSFER WILL BE GRANTED. GIVEN THE DATA PROVING THE PREVALENCE OF BULLYING AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS HOUSE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION I KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG DAY THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL. CONSIDERATION I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY NINE THE BILL THAT REFERS TO WHAT MAKES YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND WHAT MISTER MCCARTY REFERRED TO EARLIER THAT. WE WOULD BE AVOIDING A LOT OF THE ALL THESE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY IF WE HAD FULL AND FAIR FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL THAT I AM PRESENTING IT PROPOSES A ROAD MAP TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE. AMONG THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION AND K. THROUGH TWELVE PER PEOPLE SPENDING. THIS BILL -- PAPA PROPOSES FULL AND FAIR FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE. THERE ARE THREE MAIN POINTS THAT I WANT TO BRIEFLY EMPHASIZE BEFORE TURN OVER TO MY MY WITNESS BECAUSE MY SECOND WHEN THIS ONE ALREADY. BUT THE FIRST POINT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA WE DID THIS BEFORE WHEN WE ADOPTED THE LCF AT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND TWENTY THIRTEEN SOME OF US INCLUDING -- DOCTOR WEBER AND AND MISTER O'DONNELL AND AND MYSELF WE WERE HAND THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME WHEN WE ADOPTED LC FF. AND AT THAT TIME AS YOU WELL KNOW MISTER CHAIR WE ADOPTED FUNDING TARGETS TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK -- THEN TO WHERE WE USED TO BE BEFORE THE BUDGET CUTS THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO MAKE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. GOVERNOR BROWN PUSHED THOSE -- THE DEAD TWENTY THIRTEEN FUNDING TARGETS THESE FUNDING TARGETS THAT WE ADOPTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN PROVIDED THE ROAD MAP OR THE BENCHMARK SPIKE WHICH ME MEASURE WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING. OUR GOAL AND THANKS TO A STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE RESTORED THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE MET THE FUNDING TARGETS TWO YEARS AHEAD OF THE GOVERNOR'S TIMELINE. THIS BILL PROPOSES WHAT I'M CALLING L. C. F. F. TWO POINT NO. NOW THAT WE MET OUR FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING TARGETS RESTORE EDUCATION FUNDING CUTS MADE DURING THE RECESSION WE NEED A NEW SET OF FUNDING GOALS TO GET CALIFORNIA BACK TO THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION. IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. WE DID THIS BEFORE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. SECOND POINT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS BILL PROPOSES A ROAD MAP NOT AN APPROPRIATION WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL FUNDING IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE BUDGET BILL THAT WE PASSED EVERY YEAR. THIS BILL PROVOKED OPPOSES THE PLAN WITH FUNDING TYPE TARGETS TO GUIDE OUR FUTURE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS THIS BILL DOES NOT BY ITSEF CREATE A THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR OBLIGATION. FINAL POINT IT'S A TIME LINE FOR THESE FUNDING TARGETS GOVERNOR BROWN'S BASED GRANT FUNDING TARGETS WAS DALLAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BUT HE CREATED AN EIGHT YEAR TIMELINE TO CHIEF. HAS FUNDING TARGETS THAT TIME LINE WAS NOT WRITTEN IN STATUTE SIMILARLY THIS BILL DOES NOT. HAVE A TIME LINE WRITTEN IN STATUTE BUT IN TERMS OF THE YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THE FUNDING TARGETS THAT AS PART OF THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE HAVING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND THE BUDGET CHAIRS BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT I'M NOT PROPOSING A THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IT ELSE YET THE FUNDING. IN ONE YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND LET ME TURN OVER -- TO TO MY WITNESSES SUPPORT WE HAVE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SUPERINTENDENT CHRISTOPHER HOFFMAN WHO HAS BEEN VERY PATIENTLY WAITING FOR HIS TURN THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR YES SIR -- SO MY NAME IS CHRIS FOR OFTEN ON THE PRIDE SUPERINTENDENT OAK GROVE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT -- AND I THINK YOU FOR HEARING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TODAY -- I ALSO THINK OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER SUSHI FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND AUTHORIZING UNEXPLAINED AB THIRTY NINETY TONIGHT -- UNDER REAL CFF DISTRICTS WERE ASKED TO COLLABORATE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS LOCALLY AND DEVELOP MULTI YEAR PLANS DEVELOPED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS ALL STUDENTS. AND AS WELL AS DOLLARS CAME BACK -- WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT SO THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE -- TO INCREASE SERVICES TO STUDENTS INCLUDE FIVE MAJOR AREAS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TONIGHT. NEW THINGS TO THE DISTRICT THE OFFICE OF FAMILY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE WE'RE NOW ABLE TO DO THAT AND ENGAGE WITH OUR COMMUNITIES. THE OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AGAIN A NEW DEPARTMENT IS BUILT IN THE DISTRICT THAT SERVING OUR STUDENTS ARE STAFF ACROSS THE DISTRICT. WE ALSO BUILT UP ON THINGS WE ALREADY KNEW WERE WORKING INSTEAD OF JUST CREATING NEW -- WE EXPAND OUR QUITE OUR K. TWELVE LITERACY PROGRAMS WITH AN INTENSE FOCUS ARCADE THREE EDUCATION -- MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT INCLUDING P. B. I. S. AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING SERVICES OF AN EXPANDED ACROSS ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS. WE'VE ALSO DID EXPANDED LEARNING EXPAND OF ARNICA SUMMER SCHOOL INTERCESSION BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS ON LINE OF CREDIT RECOVERY ALL THESE THINGS ARE NOW IN PLACE. BUT WITHOUT INCREASE FUNDING -- THROUGH WHAT IS PROPOSING PROPERTY PROP THIRTY NINE WE CAN'T TAKE THIS FORWARD WE HAVE TO STAY WHERE WE ARE FOR IT WORK WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND SERVE THE NEXT GROUP OF KIDS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY WITH SUBSTANTIAL SUCCESS IS ALREADY IN PLACE. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EXPAND THAT IS DUE FOR THE FUNDING AND THAT WAY WE CAN BETTER SERVE OUR FOSTER YOU OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDENTS TO HAVE. A PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THE REALITY IS THE CURRENT FUNDING ONLY ALLOWS US TO TAKE CARE OF OUR EXISTING ONGOING FUNDING THINGS LIKE. RAISES THINGS LIKE STIRS EMPERORS THINGS LIKE SPECIAL LED ENCROACHMENT INTO OUR BUDGET -- THESE ARE THE THINGS WE KNOW WE HAVE TO COVER AND THE CALL ONLY -- EXPENDITURES WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT BUT NOT ANYTHING ELSE -- WITH PROP THIRTY NINE SEASON AB THIRTY NINE A REVIEW OF THAT SENSE OF THE VOTERS LET THEM DO SO WITH THAT WITH AB. THIRTY NINE WE KNOW THIS IS A ROAD MAP FOR ASPIRATIONAL FUNDING WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA GET THIRTY FIVE MILLION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD JOB.

WILL START WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE IS AB SIX TWO FOUR YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% EIGHTY SIX TWO FOUR WHICH WAR CRIER SCHOOLS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE STUDENT ID CARDS TO INCLUDE ON THOSE CARDS PHONE NUMBERS FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINES THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS ON SB NINE SEVEN TWO WHICH WILL SOON REQUIRE STUDENT ID CARDS IN CALIFORNIA TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER FOR THE NATIONAL SUICIDE. PREVENTION LIFELINE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE FACING A CHALLENGING SITUATION INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL HEALTH. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE ESSENTIALTO THEIR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WELL BEING. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A REAL AN URGENT NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. STATISTICS DEMONSTRATE THAT ONE IN THREE TEENS WILL EXPERIENCE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE ONE IN NINE GIRLS WILL EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ABUSE BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN AN STI RATES CONTINUE TO RISE SOMEONE CALIFORNIA'S TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS. IN SHORT IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES INCLUDING INFORMATION SUPPORT COUNSELING AND TREATMENT REGARDING SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AB SIX TWO FOUR WOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE INTERNET USAGE MAY BE MONITORED BY AN ABUSER. I'M FORCING ONE OF MY WITNESSES HAD TO LEAVE BUT WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LEE ENTRE CLARK HARVEY PHD BUT THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD EVENING -- I'M LEON CLICK HARVEY FROM C. B. HA WE REPRESENT THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR ON HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS ON THE PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. EFFECTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN BE LONG LASTING AND COULD AFFECT A STUDENT'S MENTAL. NO WAY STUDENTS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO READ ONLY ACCESS INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP THEM COPE WITH THESE ISSUES. SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT PROMOTE BETTER MENTAL HEALTH AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING THE ANCILLARY ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION FOR COLLEGE ADMISSION COUNSELING IN SUPPORT. SHERRI COBURN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OPPOSITION BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW THE YOU DID ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES THEY DID THE AMENDMENTS REMOVE THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL SERVICE STUDENTS AGREE SEVENTY TWELVE POINT A CENTRAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINE ON STUDENT ID. SO I KNOW I SEE OPPOSITION LETTER UP HERE. AND I THINK YOU OF YOU ADDRESS THAT ON THE THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SIDE. CLICK RELIGIOUS SCHOOL SIGN. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RAY BURNELL. AND I SERVE AS THE EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE. AS THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC POLICY VOICE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN OUR STATE WE ARE OPPOSED TO A. B.. SIX TWO FOUR OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THE MANDATED INCLUSION. OF MULTIPLE HOTLINE NUMBERS REGARDLESS HOW WORTHY WOULD DIMINISH THE EFFICACY OF THE ONLY NUMBER NOW REQUIRED ON STOOD IDENTIFICATION CARDS. THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE. ADOLESCENT SUICIDE AND SELF INFLICTED INJURY. IS AN UNPARALLELED NATIONAL CRISIS. DEATH FROM SUICIDE AMONG CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD GREW 84% THE LAST DECADE. AND INCREASED BY 210031% FOR GIRLS AGE. TEN TO FOURTEEN SUICIDEIS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AGE TEN TO FOURTEEN AND THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. FOR THOSE AGE. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR NEARLY ONE IN. FIVE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. 9% HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE ONE OR MORE TIMES. EVERY LIES IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST WEAK AND VULNERABLE. REQUIRING ONLY THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE ON ID'S HELP PREVENT IMMINENT DEATH AMONG OUR YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OF KILLING THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY THE SINGLE NUMBER WAS REQUIRED ON STUDENTS ID'S WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND WITH UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AMONG OUR STATE'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. THIS NUMBER GIVE STUDENTS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE. IN OTHER STUDENTS WHO KNOW CLASSMATES THEY MAY BE DOING SO. I DEDICATED RESOURCE TO IMMEDIATELY ACCESS VITAL SUPPORTS NECESSARY TO CHAIR CHALLENGE AND CHERISH THEIR LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT TO DISTRACT FROM THIS RESOURCE AS AB SIX TWO FOUR WOULD DO AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NOVO SO CAN I ASK YOU WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR WHAT WHAT DO YOU WANT NOT ONE THIS BILL I'M CONFUSED. WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. I KNOW THAT BUT WHAT WHAT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU OPPOSED TO IN THE BILL THE ADDITION OF ANY NUMBERS IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINE OKAY SO YOU DON'T WANT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT HOTLINE ADDED? AT A LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE AT IT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY UNDERSTOOD SORRY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YES THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOUR NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS MATT SHARP I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH ALLIANCE DEFENDING FREEDOM OVER FORTY YEARS AGO THE SUPREME COURT RULED STRUCK DOWN A NEW HAMPSHIRE LAW THAT REQUIRED IT CITIZENS TO HAVE PLAYED DISPLAY THE STATE MOTTO ON LICENSE PLATE. HOLDING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT NOT TO BE A CAREER OF THE STATE'S MESSAGE AND JUST LAST YEAR THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT REQUIRED PRO LIFE PREGNANCY CENTERS. TO POST CONTACT INFORMATION FOR ABORTION REFERRALS. SB SIX TWENTY FOUR SUFFERS THE SAME CONSTITUTIONAL FLAWS BECAUSE IT COMPELS RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS STUDENTS AND STAFF TO USE ID BADGES THE COMMUNICATE MESSAGES THEY MAY FIND OBJECTIONABLE. UNDER THE BILL A PRIVATE COLLEGE THAT ENDORSES A PRODI UP PRO LIFE IDEOLOGY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DESIGN PRINT AND DISTRIBUTE STUDENT ID CARDS. INCLUDE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINE. USING THREAT OF LOSING STATE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID THE PRIVATE INSTITUTION MUST SURRENDER ITS VOICE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE STATE'S PREFERRED IDEOLOGY. GET THE HARMS OF AB SIX TWENTY FOUR ARE NOT LIMITED TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS STUDENTS AT BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE LIKE LAST FORCED TO BECOME CARRIERS OF THE STATE'S IDEOLOGY. ON ISSUES OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. STUDENTS PUBLICLY USER ID'S TO CHECK IN AT SCHOOL PURCHASE LUNCHES AND GAIN ACCESS TO SCHOOL EVENTS SOME SCHOOLS EVEN REQUIRE STUDENTS TO WEAR THEIR ID'S AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION. BUT UNDER AB SIX TWENTY FOUR A TEENAGE GIRL WHO STARTS A PRO LIFE CLUB AT OUR SCHOOL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DALY KERRY USE AND EVEN WHERE A TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND THIS COMPELLED SPEECH REQUIREMENT CUTS BOTH WAYS I SOME PRO CHOICE STUDENTS MAY OBJECTIVE THEIR SCHOOL CHOSE TO USE A LOCAL PRO LIFE PREGNANCY CENTER IS THE HOTLINE. I'M TO PUBLISH ON STUDENT ID'S THIS LAW WILL INEVITABLY LEAD TO COSTLY LITIGATION AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY LOSE. REQUIRING STUDENTS TO BE MESSENGERS ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT IDEOLOGY OPENS A PANDORA'S BOX BECAUSE ANY MESSAGE FORCED ON STUDENTS BY THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BE CONTROVERSIAL TO SOME. IF THE STATE WANTS TO PROMOTE A HOTLINE IT HAS A NUMERAL WAYS TO DO SO BILLBOARDS AD CAMPAIGNS FLYERS BUT WHAT IT CANNOT DO IS FORCE PRIVATE PARTIES TO SPEAK ITS MESSAGE ON ITS BEHALF THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY WELL DONE AND WITHIN TWO MINUTES -- WITH THAT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION YES PHILLIP ASKING ME WILLIAM JOSEPH UNIVERSITY WHAT ARE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS ONE OTHER THERE THERE ARE TWO SIDES THIS BILL IS A SEVEN TWELVE PORTION. AND THERE'S A HIGHER EDUCATION PORTION WHICH IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED IN THE HIGHER ED COMMITTEE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT TODAY -- WITH THAT I'M GOING -- TO THERE'S MORE THEIR OPPOSITION ANSWER YEAH GREG BURKE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. JONATHAN KELLERMAN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION OPPOSED. THANK YOU -- WITH THAT -- ECONOMY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS IS COLOR RESTRICT KILEY. GOOD EVENING MISTER GARRETT ALSO I'M. I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS. SEVEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE BUT TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL BUT THE PRIVATE COLLEGES ARE STILL IN THERE SO IS THERE A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT IS GOING BE DISCUSSING HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE SAYS NO THIS IS NOT. COMMITTEE FOR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS THE HIGHER IT PROVISIONS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. SO WELL WE ARE VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY SIZE WILLIAMS YEAH MY SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW. IF I HAD A MODEL LIKE JUST ASK THANK YOU BUT AGAIN. THIS IS THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS K. TWELVE WELL I'LL LEAVE IT UP. TO ME THAT IF I HAVE TO LISTEN ON THE CHAIR I'M GONNA SPEAK THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE IS IS K.. TWELVE THE PURVIEW OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION THE HIGHER EDUCATION THE HIRED COMMITTEE IS HIGHER EDUCATION SO THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE POLICY CONCEPTS ARE I'M SURE YOU HAVE CONCERNS. YOU'VE GOT EXPRESSLY AUTHOR INDIVIDUALLY OUTSIDE OF THIS TERM. I DON'T WANNA GET INTO THAT DEBATE TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THAT PORTION OF THE BILL TODAY WORK WE'RE WE'RE DISCUSSING THE CAGE WALL PORTIONS. AND HE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE K. TWELVE PORTION DID YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT -- I'M HAPPY TO MOVE ON I SINCE WE BOTH ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IT THEN IN WITH YOU OFF LINE AND I'LL DEFER TO THE CHAIR I I LISTEN. I JUST WE'RE NOT GOING TO AMEND ANY PART OF BILL THAT SPEAKS TO HIGHER EDUCATION PROVISIONS BECAUSE THAT IS THE PURVIEW OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE. SO THERE'S NO NEED TO DISCUSS THEM HERE TODAY. AGREED THANK YOU. I AM I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS -- SO THERE'S THAT CASES MENTIONING WAS MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY IN ITS AND SOME OF THE MATERIALS I RELATED TO THIS BILL I NATIONAL TO THE FAMILY AND LIFE ADVOCATES -- VIVA SERRA HIGH SUPREME COURT DECISION STRUCK DOWN -- PREVIOUS CALIFORNIA STATUTE AT THE REQUIRED AT PRIVATE CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS TO POST NOTICES REGARDING WHERE TO OBTAIN -- ACCESS TO ABORTION -- STRUCK DOWN ON FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS COURSE ABOUT COMPELLING INDIVIDUALS TO SPEAK A PARTICULAR MESSAGE SAYS NOTICES ALTER THE CONTENT OF THEIR SPEECHES COMPELLED SPEECH SO. I HOW WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS IS CONSTITUTIONAL UNDER THAT DECISION OR HOW WOULD YOU DISTINGUISH IT. YEAH I'M SO I THINK IT -- IF FALL SQUARELY OUTSIDE OF THE NEW FLU DECISION -- SO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS GOING ON HERE THAT ARE FOR TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NO COMPELLED SPEECH ISSUE HERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA ISSUE ID CARDS. SO THAT ALONE OBVIATES THE ISSUE THE SECOND PART OF THIS IS WE ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERTS INCLUDING LIKE ELEVEN WHO IS A CLARK -- TO FORMER JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY IS NOW A PROFESSOR AT UC IRVINE ALSO THE DEAN OF UC BERKELEY LOST HER OWN INSURANCE KEEP BOTH OF THEM ALL BEHIND ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY THE BILL THEY THINK THAT THERE'S VERY VERY CLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN. WHAT WAS GOING ON AND NAY FLOCK IN HERE WERE SIMPLY ASKING FOR NUMBER TO BE PRINTED ON THE BACK OF THE ID CARD SO WE ARE VERY VERY CONFIDENT OF THIS BILL'S CONSTITUTIONALITY? OKAY SO I I GUESS. THE WAY I MIGHT TAKE SOME ISSUE WITH THAT IS IF THE SCHOOL IS REQUIRED THE STUDENTS WHERE THE IDEA. AND THERE'S SPEECH ON THE ID THAT IS RUNS AGAINST A CORE BELIEF OF THE STUDENTS DO YOU THINK THAT RAISES FIRST I'M CONCERNS. NO I MEAN WE WE REQUIRE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO THINGS ALL THE TIME RIGHT AND THERE'S COMPETE WE SEE WE SEE EXAMPLES OF CONSULT COMPELLED SPEECH ALL THE TIME IN YOUR LICENSE PLATE IS COME COMPELLED SPEECH THE THE LABELS ON A WINE BOTTLE OR BE -- BORROWER COMPELLED SPEECH SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF COMPELLED SPEECH THAT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE IT'S NOT THAT ANY COMPELLED SPEECH IS IMPERMISSIBLE IT'S JUST DOESN'T FALL WHICH SIDE OF THE WIND AS A PHONE I THINK PUTTING A PHONE NUMBER. WHICH A PHONE NUMBER ALONE ON THE BACK OF ID CARD CLEARLY FALLS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL CITED ONLINE. GOT IT SO IT WAS SO WHAT IS THE TYPE OF COMPELLED SPEECH I GUESS I DIDN'T HEAR HOW YOU DISTINGUISHED THE THE THE PREVIOUS STATUTE ON THAT BASIS. I'M I'M SORRY I DON'T FULLY FALL SO ON THE BASIS OF THE TYPE OF SPEECH ISSUE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A PRETTY SIMILAR TYPE OF SPEECH ISSUE HERE. AS WITH -- WHAT WAS CALLED THE FACT ACT NO I MEAN THERE I MEAN THE THE FAX IN THOSE CASES COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO BACK AND READ THE NESTLE DECISION TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF A FLAVOR OF THAT? HERE THIS IS SIMPLY REQUIRING SIMPLE FACTUAL INFORMATION IT'S NOT REQUIRING A IN IN THE FACT ACT AS I AS I RECALL THE THE COMPELLED SPEECH ISSUE REQUIRED SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE A MESSAGE. HERE IS SIMPLEA FACTUAL PIECE OF INFORMATION I ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER THERE'S NO IDEOLOGY THERE IT'S A SIMPLE FACTUAL PIECE OF INFORMATION SO IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF NETWORK. OKAY I WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CONCERN THAT WAS OUT ALSO RAISED A ONE OF THE WITNESSES -- THAT WE'RE GONNA BE OF LIMITING THE EFFICACY OF THE IS THE SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINE THIS IS A BILL FROM CENTER PORTANTINO LAST YEAR -- YOU HEARD SOME STATISTICS I MEAN IT'S AN ISSUE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON QUITE A BIT WE'VE HAD THIS. RISING YOU SUICIDES IT'S REALLY TRAGIC I THINK THERE'S IF YOU'RE A CLEVERNESS THAT SHOWS YOU KIND OF HAVE A JUMBLE OF INFORMATION IT. EVEN IF SOME OF IT'S GOOD INFORMATION HERE AT AND YOU KNOW YOU IF YOU REDUCE THE SALIENCE OF OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S THERE SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND. YEAH AND I AND I JUST WANT TO THANK -- THE OPPOSITION WE HAD A VERY VERY -- RESPECTFUL AND AN APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION -- I DO AND I APPRECIATE THEM COMING INTO RAISING CONCERNS IN THE MANNER THAT THEY DID I THINK WE I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ON THIS POINT WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT. WITH FOUR NUMBERS YOUNG PEOPLE CAN FIND THE NUMBER THAT THEY NEED I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S OVER AGAIN OVERWHELMED OR CONFUSED ANYBODY. AND YOU KNOW WE WE HAD A CONVERSATION PERHAPS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO PUT THAT ITEM AND READ OR BOLD IT OR DO SOMETHING ELSE TO TO CALL OUT THE THE SUICIDE LIFELINE BUT WE WE HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR ABILITY TO FIND THE LINE. THAT THEY NEED [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE YOU DOING THIS. ALL RIGHT QUESTION. WHAT REMAINS NOW I I'M LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS AND SO MUCH HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT SO WHAT IS THE? WHAT REMAINS AT THIS POINT? THEY SHOULD YOUR ADVOCATING FOR THANK YOU DOCTOR SO WHAT WE TOOK OUT WISE -- THE APPLICATION OF THE BILL TWO K. THROUGH TWELVE RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS I'M SORRY SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS ALSO EVER IT APPLY STILL -- TO SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE PUBLIC AND THEN HIGHER ED BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. BUT IT ALSO SAYS YOU'RE REMOVING THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE DOMESTIC HOTLINE. AND THE SEXUAL ASSAULT LINE. CHAU WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAD IN THE BILL WE WANTED TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY -- IF FOLKS WOULD RATHER IS THAT TO SAY THAN HAVE THE NATIONAL HOTLINE YOU WANTED TO PRINT A LOCAL HOTLINE. WE'VE REMOVED THAT FOUR SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE BUT IT WOULD GIVE FOR EXAMPLE IF SAN DIEGO STATE WANTED TO HAVE A A CAMPUS -- SEXUAL ASSAULT HOTLINE RATHER THAN THE NATIONAL LINE WOULD STILL GIVE SAN DIEGO STATE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO WE PRESERVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL BUT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS JUST TO MAKE IT EASIER -- SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE THAT THEY'LL HAVE THE NATIONAL HOTLINE OKAY SO THE HAVE THE NATIONAL RATHER THAN THE LOCAL SO THAT WAS THE ONLY CHANGE YES OKAY. RIGHT. THANK YOU SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- YOU MISTER CABLE AND I I JUST. I THE THESE ARE THESE ARE IMPORTANT PROVISION OF AND ADD TO THE STEW NINETIES I'M VERY SUPPORT OF THEM BUT I JUST HOPE THAT NEXT YEAR WE DON'T HAVE TEN MORE THESE BILLS. SO THAT OTHER NUMBERS BECOME ALMOST IMMATERIAL NOT EVEN REVERSIBLE OF STUDENT ID WHICH IS ONLY A BIG. SO I HOPE YOU'LL BE MY CHAMPION NEXT YEAR TO HELP ME PUSH BACK. WHEN I GET TEN BILLS AT ONCE PEOPLE WANT TO ADD? NUMBERS ON TO THE STUDENT ID THESE ARE IMPORTANT. I'M WITH YOU BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE NEXT. SO WITH THAT -- THE MOTION IS DO YOU AGREE TO THE AMENDMENTS THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO HIGHER EDUCATION THERE'S BEEN A MOVE -- MOTION A SECOND PLEASE CLOSE. I LOOK FOR TO WORKING ARM IN ARM WITH YOU ON THAT I THINK THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT WE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS ON A STUDENT'S.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB SIX SIX SIX A BILL THAT REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A MODEL REFERRAL PROTOCOLS. TO ADDRESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THE COMMITTEE IS NO DOUBT AWARE OF THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA. TEACHERS ARE OFTEN THE FIRST TO NOTICE CHANGES IN STUDENT BEHAVIOR THAT CAN SIGNAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES GET EDUCATORS REPORT A LACK OF PREPAREDNESS IN ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CONSULT WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND EDUCATION EXPERTS TO DESIGN A MENTAL HEALTH REFER A PROTOCOL FOR VOLUNTARY USE BY SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT PLEASE WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING. TO BETTER ADDRESS DID MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFIED AS AN EXPERT ON THE ISSUE SHERRY COBURN PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON -- AS YOU KNOW ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS -- SUFFER FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- SCHOOL NURSES SPEND OVER 30% OF THEIR TIME PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL IN SCHOOLS WE'RE OFTEN FIRST TO ASSESS. AND IDENTIFY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. THESE ISSUES WHICH AFFECT STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ATTENDANCE AND SUCCESS IN SCHOOL THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROCESS IS NECESSARY FOR IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HAVING A REFERRAL PROTOCOL. FOR STAFF WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE SERVICES TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THIS IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR THE ORDERING REFERRAL AND PRESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE ELLIE MEDI CAL BILLING OPTION PROGRAM -- TO READ BRING DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR STUDENT SERVICES WE ARE SO IN SUPPORT BECAUSE AS PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WE UNDERSTAND HOW BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. CAN IMPACT A STUDENT SUCCESS IN SCHOOL A PREVENTION AND EARLY EVEN INTERVENTION PROCESS WILL SIS SCHOOL STAFF IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES AND IN FACT MY OWN SON WAS SUICIDAL. IN SCHOOL AND IN BECAUSE HE WAS REFERRED TO A NURSE WHO KNEW WHAT TO DO HE WAS ABLE TO GET HELP SO THIS PERSONALLY TOUCHES. HOME.

A SCENE OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I'M HAPPY TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS SAW SOME BILLS ARE PERSONAL PEOPLE THIS ONE'S PROFESSIONAL TO ME. THIS IS ACTUALLY A BILL I RAN A COUPLE YEARS AGO NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY ADVOCACY GROUP BUT MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE AND I SAW THAT THERE WEREN'T PROTOCOLS WHEN YOU WERE NOTICING A STUDENT THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. CERTAINLY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TEACHER DIAGNOSING OR TREATING. BUT WE NEED A PATH FOR STUDENTS TO FIND RESOURCES AND I YOU KNOW I'M NOT CONFIDENT. THAT THAT EXISTS ON EVERY SCHOOL SITE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MEANS HOW DO WE GET THE STUDENT WE THINK MIGHT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME. JUST HANDING THEM OFF TO A COUNSELOR ISN'T ENOUGH THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO SO I'M. I'M VERY POSITIVE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU WITH THAT ANY.

THE ACLU RECENTLY ISSUED A NATIONAL REPORT TITLED COPS AND NO COUNSELORS HOW THE LACK OF SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH STAFF IS HARMING STUDENTS. THAT REPORT CALLS ATTENTION TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT STAFF WHO ARE A KEY PART OF IMPROVING SCHOOL CLIMATE AND MAKING SCHOOLS SAFER. THE DATA USED FOR THAT REPORT SHOW THAT OVER THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN SCHOOLS WHERE THERE IS A FULL TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. AT THE SCHOOL BUT NO COUNSELOR. FOR MANY STUDENTS WITH THE PRESENCE OF A OF SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER CAN MAKE SCHOOL FEEL MORE LIKE A DETENTION CENTER THAN A SCHOOL A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE SEEN AS SUSPECTS. WE'VE ALL SEEN THE VIDEOS OF STUDENTS PUSHED OR THROWN TO THE GROUND BY THE OFFICERS AND THEIR SCHOOL SOMETIMES FOR OFFENSES AS MINOR AS PUT FAILING TO PUT A CELL PHONE AWAY. WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF POLICE IN OUR SCHOOLS NOT TO INCREASE AT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP SCHOOL SAFE. WE NEED TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS AND A WELCOMING INCLUSIVE PLACES THAT SUPPORT THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS AND THAT HAVE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BUILD COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS CONFLICT WITH NON PUNITIVE METHODS. LET'S FOCUS ON PROVIDING SCHOOLS WITH THOSE RESOURCES RATHER THAN INVESTING IN EXPENSIVE MEASURES THAT WILL JUST MAKE THINGS WORSE THANK YOU ASKED FOR YOUR NOVEL. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STANDARD FOR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT AB SEVEN FIFTY COULD LEAD TO CONTRACTING OUT OF CLASSIFIED POSITIONS. I'M MORE STILL REVIEWING THOSE OF THE AUTHORS OFFICE DID SHARE THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE FLEXIBILITY -- TO CONTRACT WITH OUTSIDE AGENCIES I'M HOWEVER EDUCATION CODE DOES ALLOW CONTRACTING OUT OF CLASSIFIED SERVICES IN SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. AND SOME OF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE PROJECTS TO PROTECT CLASSIFIED JOBS AND THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEN OTHERS UP THE OPPOSITION WILL BRING A BEHIND THE THE REAL OF THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS -- BUT MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SUMMER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD -- I APPRECIATE YOUR TRYING TO DO I THINK THE INTENTION KNOWING YOU. ARE CERTAINLY IS GENUINE -- SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST RECALL MY OWN. UPBRINGING AND BE IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVING FENCING AROUND AND CAMPUS THAT ALONE -- HAD HAS EMOTIONAL -- BUT THE MOST TIMES TO USE HAVING TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND FOR EXAMPLE IN DC WHERE. I STUDENTS AT THE WATER METAL DETECTORS GOING TO THE SCHOOL -- YOU KNOW I JUST I THINK IT -- IT SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE TRYING. TO CHANGE THIS SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE -- CULTURE THAT'S BEEN CREATED OVER MANY DECADES UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS BUT OPERATIONAL NURSES AND MORE TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOLS BEFORE WE REQUIRE -- THEM TO HAVE MORE SECURITY OFFICERS SO JUST RESPECTFULLY I WON'T GO TO SUPPORT YOU TODAY BUT STILL PUSHING. THANK YOU MISTER CARTER. YEAH I THINK YOU AYE AYE I MET WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR DIALOGUE IN YOUR HISTORY TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU. HAVE WORK WITHIN YOUR PRIOR LIFE AND I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST BILL. WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THEY AND THE COUNSELOR RATIO IS IS -- DISGRACE AND YOU KNOW IT'S GETTING WORSE IN SOME DISTRICTS THEY'RE ACTUALLY LAYING OFF COUNSELORS IN THESE PROFESSIONALS AND YOU KNOW I SAW A BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE AT THE CAPITOL FEW WEEKS AGO THE SIGNS AND THEY SAID WHAT THEY WANTED MORE COUNSELORS NOT SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND SO. I THINK IT'S HARD WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND TALK TO THEM AND SUPPORT THEM. AT THE SAME TIME. FOCUS ON THIS BUT I WILL NOTE THAT -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF LCF AFTER FRANKLY NOT ENOUGH MONEY AS WE KNOW WE'RE STILL FORTY FIRST NATION FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS WAS THAT. IT'S UP TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES IF THEY THINK THIS IS A PRIORITY. THEY CERTAINLY CAN CAN STEP UP AND FOCUS THEIR THEIR RESOURCES HERE -- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT TO TAKE IT OUT OF THAT MOVIE TO MANDATE BUT IT'S IT ONE MORE DOLLAR GOING TO PAY A STATE MANDATE WHETHER I'LL SET UP OR NOT HE'S IS A DOLLAR THAT WE WON'T HAVE. TO TO POTENTIALLY OVER APPROPRIATE NINETY EIGHT I MEAN MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH NINETY IT SHOULDN'T BE. SHOULDN'T BE -- YOU KNOW. THE END ALL THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON OVER A PER PER OVER APPROPRIATING SO. IT DOES PUT PRESSURE ON US IN HERE IS THAT -- I DON'T THINK OUR PURPOSE SO -- I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR IT LET ME SEE IF I'M IF I'M CLEAR ON THIS THIS BEGAN ORIGINALLY AS A MANDATE. EVERYBODY HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST. ONE NOW IT JUST SAYS THAT IS THAT YOU YOU CAN HAVE. ONE OR YOU CAN DO IT BUT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO IT IS THAT CORRECT. FOR ASKING THAT -- ALL THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN EVERY SCHOOL CAMPUS HAVE AN SRO WHEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE CHANGE FROM A SIMILAR BILL AS TO THE LAST YEAR. ARE THOSE PRESENTED BY SOMEONE JAMES GALLAGHER WAS THE S. R. O. COULD BE ARMED OR UNARMED IT WOULD BE UP TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF WHETHER OR NOT. THEY'LL BE. CHOOSING A DECIDING SUCH. OKAY SO. BASICALLY THE RECORD YOUR ORIGINAL ONE WAS TO REQUIRE THE AMENDMENT SAY IT INTENT TO AN URGE SCHOOLS TO CONSIDER OVERALL STAFFING LEVELS TO ENSURE AB ONE IS NOT THERE ANYMORE JUST. THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING URGED TO CONSIDER IT IS THAT CORRECT MISTER CHAIR. WELL WE HAVE A DID THE AMENDMENTS. IT IS A MANDATE. FOR AN SRO PER SCHOOL -- SOLIS WAS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS. IT TO BE CLEAR IT IS A MANDATE IT IS A MANDATE OKAY THEN AB I THOUGHT IT'D GONE RECOMMENDATION THEN I I WOULD MANDATE IT MOST OF MY SCHOOLS HAVE AS SORROWS BUT I DON'T THINK I WANT TO MANDATE THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE -- ONE I WOULD MIND IF YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO CONSIDERED WHICH THEY CAN'T AT THIS POINT BUT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO MANDATE -- S. ARE ALL WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE OTHER THINGS ON CAMPUS SO ANYWAY BUT THANK YOU I THOUGHT IT WAS HAD BEEN CHANGED SO THIS LANGUAGE IS VERY. THANK YOU -- I I I THINK YOU FOR THE BILL I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT AS FAR AS LIKE EIGHTY A WHAT IS THE ATTENDANCE OF THE SCHOOL. AS EVERY SCHOOL REALLY NEED THAT. SOME OF OUR LARGER SCHOOLS LIKE THE HIGH SCHOOL I CAME FROM HEAD. TO OKAY BUT THEY AREN'T ALWAYS ON CAMPUS AS WELL I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE -- THEY'RE OFTEN DRIVING AROUND THE CAMPUS BECAUSE THINGS HAPPEN AROUND THE CAMPUS DURING THE DAY AND CERTAINLY THE BEGINNING TODAY AND FOR SURE AT THE END OF THE DAY. SO TO SAY WE DON'T NEED THESE ON OUR CAMPUSES AT ALL IS A VERY UNDER EDUCATED PERSPECTIVE THAT IS SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE TRAGEDY. THAT WE HAVE SEEN. FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL MORE THAN ONCE. AND I'D LOVE TO THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT. ACTIVE PRESENCE FROM PLACE RIGHT AROUND THE SCHOOL IN PARTICULAR -- DURING THOSE THOSE THOSE THOSE MORE VULNERABLE HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS. AND I THINK HAVING A A AN OFFICER ON CAMPUS HELPS A LOT TO KNOW IN OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THEY AREN'T THEY THEY ARE. I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THE VISION THAT IS SOMEHOW WALKING AROUND THE CLASSROOMS AND READY TO CATCH A BUS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PERFORMING ANY DISCIPLINE ON CAMPUS UNLESS IT'S PROBABLY SOME SERIOUS CRIME. BUT VERY RARELY WHAT A POLICE OFFICER EVER ENGAGES STUDENTS WITH REGARD TO THE TO SOMETHING THE STUDENT DID AT SCHOOL AGAIN UNLESS IT WERE A SERIOUS CRIME SO -- THESE OFFICERS. TO PROVIDE SAFETY AT OUR CAMPUSES LISTEN MY SCHOOL FIVE THOUSAND KIDS PLUS RIGHT THAT'S A SMALL CITY. YEAH BUT YOU A SMALL CITY OF FIVE THOUSAND AS MORE POLICE OFFICERS THAT BUT DO WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS ABSOLUTELY WE NEED MORE COUNSELORS WILL YOU NEED BE COPS ON CAMPUS -- GRANT YOU THAT BUT TO SAY WE DO NOT NEED ANY COPS ON CAMPUS IS IS A VERY UNEDUCATED PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK PUTS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS YOU KNOW IN IN IN AN UNSAFE SPOT I HAVE. A DAUGHTER HIGH SCHOOL QUE I WANNA. POLICE OFFICER ON OUR CAMPUS AND I KNOW THAT IN OUR CITY IN THE PAST I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING TODAY WHEN I MATCH IS STILL THE CITY ACTUALLY FUNDS THAT POLICE OFFICER. ON THE CAMPUS BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS A NET BENEFIT FOR THE FOR THE ENTIRE CITY TO HAVE A A PRESENCE ON CAMPUS AND ALSO. YOU KNOW DURING A LITTLE HOURS TO DRIVE AROUND THE SCHOOL TO HAVE THAT PRESENCE SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL BUT AGAIN I THIS IS VERY COSTLY. I THINK YOU KNOW THAT -- AND AGAIN I WANT MORE COUNSELORS AND COPS BUT STILL I WANT COPS WITH THAT -- THERE'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED I BELIEVE KNOW IF. WE HAVE A VOTE MOTION. YOU MUST KNOW ALL SECOND. IT'S TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT -- TIME SORRY DID NOT CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TIME I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE MR MCLARTY'S COMMENTS DR WEBBER'S AND ALSO MISTER KALRA AS IN THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD PART OF THIS. FROM MY BACKGROUND IS EDUCATOR I'VE YOU SEE MY DOCTORATE FROM USC YET I DON'T HAVE TO PAY MY WAY AND BY THE WAY. BUT I DID GET MY DOCTORATE FROM U. S. C. AND ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD AND THE ACADEMIC JOURNALS THAT WE HAD. WAS BY DOCTOR PATIENT GARCIA AND IT TALKED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AS RELATIONS ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND ALTERNATIVE THE THESIS THE IMPETUS OF THAT ACADEMIC DURABLE WAS WHEN STUDENTS DON'T FEEL SAFE IT REDUCES OUR ABILITY TO LEARN. AND I TRULY BELIEVE HAS A FORMER RESERVE DEPUTY AS A FORMER EDUCATOR MYSELF. THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SAFE IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF MAKING SURE THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN SECURE. IN ADDITION TO A LOT OF ESTARá OWNS THEIR MORE THAN SOMEONE IS JUST A SOURCE OF SECURITY. THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL THEY'RE THE BIG BROTHERS AND BIG SISTERS ON CAMPUS AND THEIR SURROGATE MOTHER AND FATHER SO THIS REALLY MY INTENT TO CREATE A INDICATION ENVIRONMENT. HOUSE WERE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS SAFE FOR ALL KIDS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I APPRECIATE -- THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE I CERTAINLY WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH YOU CONTINUING ON THIS BILL. I SAY WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY AS WHEN I WROTE THE HEARING AT THAT POINT THEY'RE MORE THAN JUST POLICE OFFICERS OR ASST. SOME TYPE OF OFFICER BECAUSE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THINGS THAT HAPPEN OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL OFTEN COME INTO THE SCHOOL AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN INSIDE THE SCHOOL OFTEN GO OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. ESPECIALLY IN SUMMER MORE DENSER NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY CAN OTHER FINGER ON THE PULSE TO HELP ADDRESS THEM VERY PROACTIVELY BEFORE THEY BECOME A TRAGEDY SO THANK YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS WITH AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I'D KILEY. KILEY AYE KALRA. KALRA NOT VOTING. MCCARTY. MCCARTY NOT VOTING SMITH. SMITH I WEBER. WEBER NOT VOTING [inaudible] SO. THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES FAILED. YOUR TIME MISTER THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOTOR FILE ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN AB FOR THIRTEEN BY MISTER -- JONES SAWYER. MISTER JONES STORY MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF AB FOUR ONE THREE CHANGES. REFERENCES OF AT RISK TO AT PROMISE IN THE EDUCATION AND PENAL CODES. AT RISK IS A STIGMATIZED LABEL THAT IS CREATED AN EX EXPECTATION OF FAILURE FAILURE AND FOCUSES. ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF USE BECOMING ANOTHER STATISTIC THIS IS A MINDSET THAT IS ALL TOO PERVASIVE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. AT THE STATE WE NEED TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL WITH THE LANGUAGE WE USE AND BE AWARE OF THE MESSAGE THAT IT SENDS TO BOTH THE STUDENTS AND THE PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITH THEM. IMAGINE OUR STUDENTS ATTENDING AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT IS KNOWING THAT THEY'RE VIEWED AS AT RISK. RISK IS SOMETHING WE ACTUALLY TRY TO AVOID OFTENTIMES IS SOMETHING WE WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR WILL MINIMIZE ALL AT ALL COSTS. THIS LABEL SHOULD NOT BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. BY CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE WE DO TWO THINGS. ONE WE'RE SENDING A MESSAGE TO PROFESSIONALS WORKING WITH STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN IT IN EIGHT GIVES EVERY CHILD POSSESSES AND TO WE'RE TELLING THE STUDENT THAT THEY'RE WORTH IT. AND THAT WE BELIEVE IN THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED WORDS MATTER. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW THE PRESIDENT WE HAVE ALREADY SET USING PEOPLE FIRST LANGUAGE AND THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES COMMUNITY. AND TRANSITION TO THE STRENGTH BASED APPROACH OF AT PROMISED THE STUDENTS ARE MORE THAN THEIR SITUATION AND THEY NEED TO BE TREATED AS SUCH. BY USING A MORE POSITIVE MINDSET AB FOR THIRTEEN ENCOURAGES TEACHERS TO EMPOWERS STUDENTS AND EMPHASIZED THEIR IMMENSE POTENTIAL TO SUCCEED RATHER THAN FOCUS ON WHAT THEY LACK FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE BOAT WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. IS ARE ANY SOBRE FROM AS I. A. TECH AND PAM GIVES OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OFFICE OF EDUCATION. YOUR FIRST WITNESS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MANY SILVA -- ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS SAITEK I ALSO SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE REACHING OUT PROMISE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION WE PICKED THAT TITLE BECAUSE WORDS ARE POWERFUL. AND SHOWERING UNDER PERFORMING STUDENTS WITH POSITIVE LANGUAGE LIKE AT PROMISE NOT ONLY INCREASES THE CONFIDENCE AND PERSISTENCE. IT ALL THE DATE ALSO SHOWS THAT INCREASES EDUCATE ALSO EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT OUTCOMES AS WELL. THE FOCUS ON DEFICIT LOW IS EXPECTATIONS LOWERED EXPECTATIONS LEAD TO FILL YOUR DISENGAGEMENT. HAVE PROMISED FOCUSES ON THE POTENTIAL OF A STUDENT WE RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL STUDENTS HAVE HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY DEMONSTRATE STRONGER OUTCOMES AB FOR THIRTEEN SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S WORK AT ADDRESSING TRAUMA. BUILDING MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS AND RECOGNIZING THE INHERENT VALUES OF STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAMELA GIPSON REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS DR TO AVERAGE ONE OF WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE KNOW AS THE MEMBER SAID AND AS OUR CO SPONSOR SAID WORDS MATTER. I RECENTLY ATTENDED AN EVENT WHERE I VOLUNTEERED TO HELPS SUPPORT STUDENTS WHO WERE CONSIDERED AT RISK AND I WAS VERY DISMAYED TO SEE A POSTER. REFERRING TO THEM AS SUCH THEY WERE AT RISK STUDENTS AND THIS IS WHAT THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO DO WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO SERVE TO SERVE THEM. AND I FELT THIS MADE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IN LIGHT OF THIS BILL I THOUGHT ONE OF THE STUDENTS FEELING. FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE VOLUNTEERING AND EDUCATORS HAVE AN INTEREST IN SEEING THE BEST IN THE CHILDREN. THAT WE ARE SERVING. IT'S THE CHILDREN'S VIEW OF THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SEE A POSTER LIKE THAT IMAGINE IF IT SAID SERVING AT PROMISE YOU WHEN THEY WALK INTO THE DOOR OF SUCH A PROGRAM. SO IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE FEEL A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT ALSO IT THE CHANGE IN THE WAY WE SPEAK ABOUT THESE USE OF WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THEM FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. JEFF PARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- ANY OPPOSITION SAYING OPPOSITION WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

BETWEEN STATE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DEVELOPERS. STATE BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN MATCHED BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOCAL FUNDS AND DEVELOPER FEES.

CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS SIMPLY CANNOT FULFILL THEIR ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IF ATTENTION IS NOT GIVEN TO ENSURE FACILITIES ARE CLEAN SAFE AND SECURE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE PROGRAM IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THEY'VE DONE SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE THIS PARTNERSHIP IS BENEFITTED MORE THAN SIX MILLION STUDENTS. IN TALKING WITH OUR MEMBERS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR PROP AB.

OUR CLASSROOMS MEET THE NEEDS OF EDUCATION IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO I'M ALL WITH YOU ON THIS. I HAVE ONE ISSUE THAT THE YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IS -- WE GO FOR HISTORICALLY THEY'VE BEEN EITHER A K. FOURTEEN BOND. OR SOMETIMES A CASE SIXTEEN BOND AND I'M ASKING THAT WE PUT ONE LITTLE LETTER AT THE BEGINNING A P.. FOR OUT REALLY EDUCATION AND THAT'S FOR PUBLIC EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR STATE STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AT PUBLIC FACILITY SO. I HAVE ANOTHER MEASURE THAT TIME WORKING WITH AS YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW -- THINKING ABOUT IT'S IT'S GOING FORWARD BETTER TO TO TO TEAM UP WITH THIS ONE ON YOU SO HOPE WE CAN MAKE THAT -- PARTNERSHIP AND AND WE'RE GOING. FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. DR WEBER. YES I HAVE. I'M AND YOU KNOW WHAT ALWAYS IN FAVOR BONDS AND BECAUSE OF FACILITIES ARE.

AND OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE BOARD I WOULD JUST SIMPLY LIKE TO ENCOURAGE US TO RECOGNIZE THAT OFTENTIMES. LIKE MANY COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT OUT OF THAT IN PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE APPRENTICESHIPS. THE BONDS THE CONTRACTS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND OFTENTIMES NOT BENEFIT FROM THE BOND THAT WE PUT OUT THERE.

SO I GET I HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. SECRETARY KALRA PLEASE. THE MOTION IS THE PAST TO HIGHER EDUCATION O'DONNELL. RIGHT O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NOT VOTING KALRA. KALRA I'D MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE SMITH SMITH I WEBER WEBER I FIVE VOTES THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU. THE MANAGER OF A GOOD MOVE AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX PLEASE DON'T. YEP ALREADY -- I THANK YOU MISTER KILEY FOR BEING. AN AUTHOR ON THIS AS WELL -- I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH BY ENSURING THAT AVAILABLE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS ARE USED EFFECTIVELY. WE KNOW THAT YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MORE LIKELY WE KNOW THAT YOUTH WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. TO ENGAGE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER RISK TAKING BEHAVIOS. RULES RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS BUT GENERALLY LACK THE LACK LACK ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THE SERVICES ARE EXPENSIVE AND THEY NEED TO BE. CONDUCTED BY PROFESSIONALS. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COMMISSION OVERSEES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTOR MHSAA WHICH FUNDS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THROUGH A 1% TAX ON PERSONAL INCOMES ABOVE ONE MILLION DOLLARS. A PORTION OF THE M. HSA FUNDS ARE TO BE USED FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY PREVENTION FOR CHILDREN IN YEARS. IN MANY CASES SCHOOLS ARE UNDER WELLER UNAWARE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE FUNDS OR HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS THEM TO MEET THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OF THEIR STUDENTS. THIS BILL WILL ESTABLISH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS TO SUPPORT COUNTIES IN ADDRESSING KEY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP TOOLS TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY A MENTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS WILL ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FUNNY AVAILABLE TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS. FINALLY AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL ESTABLISH AN INNOVATION AND AGAIN CURATOR. TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO INNOVATIVE COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS WRITING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND WITH ME. TO TO TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE A DOCTOR TOBY EWING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND YVONNE -- CARILLO OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT MINISTRY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MANAGED TO BE DOING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION FOR SET UP TO BE HERE THIS EVENING -- SO THE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE COMMISSION REALLY HAS BEEN WORKING TO PUT IN PLACE TOOLS AND STRATEGIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING IN OUR COUNTIES AND WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE. THE COMMISSION HAS PRIORITIZE SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AS A TOPIC THAT WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS REALLY EQUIPPED THE STATE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHEN THEY'RE AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE TO PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES THAT CAN SUPPORT THE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NECESSARY BETWEEN OUR COUNTIES? AND OUR SCHOOLS AND OTHER PARTNERS PARTNERS AND I WOULD AND I WOULD ADD IN IN REFERENCE TO MR MCCARTY'S COMING EARLIER THAT WOULD INCLUDE FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS AND OTHER KINDS OF PARTNERS FOR THAT KEY. PRIOR TO THAT THE K. TWELVE OF THE CASE SIXTEEN CONVERSATION. IT ALSO IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ENGAGE THOSE PARTNERS TO THINK ABOUT CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN RE THINK HOW WE DELIVER CARE IN WAYS IT'S MORE HUMAN CENTERED. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE PAST THAT THE HISTORICAL TRADITIONAL WAYS OF OFTEN STYLING CARE BASED ON A DIAGNOSIS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND REALLY THINK ABOUT PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES THE DROP ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE INSTITUTIONS. SUCH AS OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNTIES WITHOUT THE COMMISSION IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE THINK IT SIGNALS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO REALLY PARTNER WITH THE COUNTIES. TO NOT JUST UNDERSTAND IS WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING BUT TO PUT IN PLACE THE STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WITH THAT WE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING -- MY NAME IS EVEN CARRY ON WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. AND AUTHORS IN THE COMMITTEES RECOGNITION OF THE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT THAT'S FACING OUR YOUTH I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AXIS SUPPORTS A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX BECAUSE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GET THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS. THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. IT WILL DO THIS BY INCREASING STAKEHOLDERS ABILITY. TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF SERVICES FUNDED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. BY INCORPORATING STUDENT CENTERED METRICS A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL INCREASE THE FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AT SCHOOLS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT AB ELEVEN TWENTY SIX WILL HELP TO BREAK DOWN SILOS BETWEEN EDUCATION AND COUNTY PROVIDERS. AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT. THANK YOU SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT PLEASE TRY TO CARE ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THE GARAGE WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. JIMMY FROM IN A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS.

SIX VOTES THE BILLS OUT. MR DOWN MOVING ON TO FILE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE AB. THIRTEEN OH THREE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN OH THREE WHICH INCREASES THE FUNDING FOR CRITICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. PER YEAR FOR THE ONE ONE LOCAL MATCH. THIS BILL ALSO CONSOLIDATES K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS BY SHIFTING TO K. TWELVE PORTION OF THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HIGH QUALITY CAREER TECHNOLOGY KENSHIN'S IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GAIN THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE OR MARK ON POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THE STRENGTH OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY DEPENDS ON SKILLED WORKFORCE A SKILLED WORKFORCE AND SEAT HE PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIAL. ARE ESSENTIAL PART OF BUILDING THAT WORKFORCE AND I I WAS IN MY CLASSROOM I CAN SAY THAT. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT STUDENTS NEED MULTIPLE PATHS TO SUCCESS. WE SHOULD NOT TRACK THEM. WE SHOULD MAKE THEM ALL YOU KNOW RATE COLLEGE READY BUT THE SAME TIME WE SHOULDN'T MANDATE THAT THEY CAUGHT THEY ALL GO TO COLLEGE. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET PROVIDING ONGOING FUNNY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR THE C. T. PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS WATER FIFTY MILLION FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM -- CLEARLY THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FOR FUNNY ON GOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGH QUALITY C. T. PROGRAMS ARE IS ALSO A CLEAR NEED TO CONSOLIDATE. THE K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS TO AVOID SIGNIFICAN HURDLES AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT. AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS AND HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN OH THREE US -- WHEN SKILLS THAT -- NO -- MAYBE NOT -- LINDA GRANGER SUPERINTENDENT OF THE EATEN R. O. P. AND JULIE DUNCAN TRI VALLEY R. O. P.. I WITH THAT BEFORE I TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES I ALSO WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN CARTY. WHO IS VERY ACTIVE IN SUPPORT OF -- FUNDING C. T. AS CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB TO THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT WITHOUT MY WITNESSES MANAGER. THE GRAINGER SUPERINTENDENT WITH EATING AREA REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL PROGRAM AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THREE THINGS THAT I HAVE THINK OF BEEN EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SEA TAKE PROGRAM. ONE IS THE ALLOCATION MODEL GIVEN THAT IT IS BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT IT PROVIDES FOR A MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO ONGOING FUNDING WITH ANNUAL ACCOUNTABILITY INSURERS THAT WE MAINTAIN IN PROGRESS. NAME PROGRESS TOWARD EVERY PROGRAM MEETING HIGH QUALITY STANDARD FORT CTP. THREE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM REGIONAL MODEL OF DELIVERY THROUGH THE COUNTIES LEVERAGES STAFFING TO PROVIDE TAILOR CONTENT TO THE FIELD BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE REGION. CONTRAST THAT WITH THE STRONG WORK FORCE MODEL ONGOING STATEWIDE FUNDING HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A ONE TIME REGIONAL COMPETITIVE GRANTS AND YOU CAN ONLY APPLY IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AGREES TO WORK WITH YOU. YET THE ALLOCATION IS PARTIALLY BASED ON EIGHTY A OF THE REGION THIS CREATES AN ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUE. GRANTS ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE STRONG WORK FORCE REGIONS AND THEY WERE NOT SET UP TO HAVE THE STRUCTURE OR KNOWLEDGE OF K. TWELVE NEEDED TO MANAGE THIS PROGRAM WHY CREATING ANOTHER SYSTEM WHEN WE HAVE THE CD.
