BEGIN BY ACCEPING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME TO IMPROVE THE IMPORTANT BILL- THE RICK BEST SAFETY ACT IS NAMED AFTER LONGTIME LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND LOBBYISTS RICK. BASS WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY AFTER A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WITH AN UNMARKED DUMPSTER. THE COMMONSENSE MEASURE WILL REQUIRE LARGE TRASH RECEPTACLES PLACED ON ROADS AND CURBS SIDES THEY HAVE LEFT FOR RED TO HAVE REFLECTIVE MARKETING ON EACH SIDE TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER ACCIDENTS WITHOUT REFLECTIVE MARKETING LARGE TRASH RECEPTACLES PLACED ON ROADS AND CURBS ARE VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE ON A DARK STREET. AT PRESENT A HAZARD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN ACCIDENTS IN OUR STATE TOOK PLACE. AT NIGHT AND IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THIS BILL SERIOUSLY AND ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND- TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO. TOTAL CYCLISTS HAVE DIED ON CALIFORNIA STREET WHICH IS AN AVERAGE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE- PEOPLE PER YEAR SENATE BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. CALIFORNIA COULD TAKE TO IMPROVE OUR ROADWAYS FOR MOTORISTS AND BICYCLISTS ALIKE. HEAVILY LOADED YARD WASTE CANS ARE ESSENTIALLY IMMOVABLE AND THEIR IMMOVABLE OBJECTS THAT OFTEN ARE DARK AND NOT COLOR DIDN'T NOT VISIBLE AT NIGHT. THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU CAN SEE A DUMPSTER BLOCK IN A BICYCLE LANE CAUSING BY CLUELESS TO VEER OFF THE ROAD OFF THE PATTERN IN THE PATH RATHER IN INTO TRAFFIC LANES AND A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT. AS WE KNOW RICK'S SCENARIO A DRIVER BICYCLIST RIDING ALONG AT NIGHT CAN POTENTIALLY RUN INTO ONE OF THE- ONE OF THESE DUMPSTERS AT FULL SPEED AND BECOME SERIOUSLY INJURED. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RETRO. MARKINGS TO ENHANCE VISIBILITY FURTHERMORE CALIFORNIA ALREADY USES LIES REFLECTIVE MARKETING OR MARKINGS ON ROADS AND TRAFFIC SIGN SLICE A PLACE JUST TO NAME A FEW. S. P. ELEVEN ELEVEN SIX TO IMPROVE NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY ENABLE ENABLING MORE REACTION TIME. AND IT WILL BE SAFER IT WILL MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER DRIVERS THAT CYCLISTS SAFER AT NIGHT IF WE TAKE ACTION.

ALL RIGHT- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEEING NO QUESTIONS COMMENTS- SO I MOVED THE BILL SET A CAREER MOVES THE BILL CENTER BARGES. THIS SEEMS LIKE A COMMON SENSE MEASURE- JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY THOUGH- HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA OR METRICS ON. THE AMOUNT OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED HAD THERE BEEN REFLECTIVE TAPE. ON THESE BINS THE STATISTICS ARE ARE- NOT TOTALLY- AVAILABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T REPORT EVERY ACCIDENT YOU WILL AROUND THAT ALLEY YOU RUN INTO THAT THE TRASH BIN YOU GET UP DUST YOURSELF OFF FOR NOW AND OFF YOU GO AND IF IT CALLS FOR A NINE ONE ONE CALL THEN IT BECOMES DISTRICT AND AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO TOTAL CYCLISTS HAVE ACTUALLY DIED- IN VARIOUS ACCIDENTS. WHICH DOES INCLUDE RUNNING INTO TRASH BINS AS AS THE BILL REPORT RECALLS- AS A MATTER OF FACT WITH THE ALL THE HIGHWAY PATROL THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE THE BUILDING I'D MAGIC A FEW OF THEM AND THEY WERE SO GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE TAKING A STEP FORWARD TO STOP ACCIDENTS PREVENT ACCIDENTS- THAT WOULD SAVE LIVES SO THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE BUILDING WE CAN TAKE THIS STEP FORWARD- I THINK IT'S WAY WAY OVERDUE.

SO WE'LL LET YOU KNOW- WHAT WHAT POINT TIME WE ACTUALLY VOTE ON THE BILL SO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BECKER HERE. AND- BETTER WE'RE PROCEEDING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE- YOU'RE FILING NUMBER THREE SP ONE ZERO FIVE NINE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THINK UP TO THE PRESENT S. B. ONE ZERO FIVE NINE THE BILLABLE CALIFORNIA STRONGER PRIVACY RIGHTS AND BETTER VISIBILITY INTO AN OPAQUE WORLD THAT OF DATA BROKERS. DATA BROKERS ARE BUSINESSES THAT COLLECT SELL AND SHARE OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH US IS A CONSUMER. WHEN THE PRIVACY GROUP EPIC THERE THOUSANDS OF DATA BROKERS UNITED STATES WHO BY I AGREE SELL TRADE BILLIONS OF DATA POINTS ON AMERICANS. SOME DATA BROKERS ADVERTISE THEY COLLECTED ANGRY OVER TEN THOUSAND DATA POINTS PER CONSUMER. I WANNA THANK JOHN OLIVER FOR KINDLY RANGING A TWENTY MINUTE SEGMENT ON DATA BROKERS OUT LAST WEEK TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. ON THIS TOPIC. BECAUSE CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE A DIRECT RELATION WITH DATA BROKERS OFTEN OBLIVIOUS TO WHO IS SELLING ENTRY IN THE PERSONAL DATA. AND WHAT THOSE THIRD PARTIES ARE DEALING WITH THAT DATA. CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BROKERS TO REGISTER WITH THE PARTNER JUSTICE AND SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT KINDS OF PERSONAL DATA THEY COLLECT AND HOW CONSUMERS CAN OPT OUT TO THAT DATA. THE PROJECT AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND OF THIS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DATA BROKERS WORLDWIDE WOULD REGISTER. IN FACT ONLY FOUR HUNDRED HAVE REGISTERED. TO THE ONE THING THIS BILL DOES SET STRICTER ANNUAL REGISTRATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DATA BROKERS AND TOUGH IT'S A PENALTY FOR DATA TRAFFICKERS WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE LAW. CONSUMER ADVOCATE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS BECAUSE REPORTS HAVE FOUND THAT MANY DID BROKERS ARE PUTTING UP ROADBLOCKS. THAT IMPEDE CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO EXERCISE THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS. SO THE OTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IS REQUESTED BROKERS TRIED CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS. ON HOW CONSUMERS CAN EXERCISE OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS TO DELETE CORRECT. OPT OUT. AND HOW TO IDENTIFY WHO'S PURCHASED A PERSONAL DATA AND LIMIT THE USE OF SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DATA BROKERS TO ANNUALLY DISCLOSE IF THEY BREACH AND- IF THEY COLLECT SELL OR SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING CHILDREN. AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL. THE TENSION MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE FOR CONSUMER TO SEE ALL THIS INFORMATION AT ONCE MAKING THE RATIO A ONE STOP SHOP DOESN'T EXIST TODAY RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO DIG THROUGH HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY DISCLOSURES AND FIND OPT OUT LINKS. IN THE SAME VEIN THE BILL ALSO CONSOLIDATES THE REGISTRATION AND REGULATION OF DATA BROKERS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY SIMPLIFYING PRIVACY OVERSIGHT FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. ARE LESS IMPORTANTLY- THE POINT OF CONTENTION HARMONIZES THE DATABROKER LOG WITH THE CPR RAY TO CLUE THE CONCEPT OF SHARING. THIS WAS THE SAME LOOPHOLE CLOSED BY THE CPR A. TO LINK AT THE BOTTOM WEB PAGE NOW SAYS DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY INFORMATION ENCOMPASS A LOT OF SHARING FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION. FOR QUOTE VALUABLE CONSIDERATION. OF EXTRAS THAT CONSUMER REPORTS I FOUND THE TICKET BROKERS CLAIM THEY DON'T TECHNICALLY SELL OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. BUT SHARE IT. TO OPERATE THE SHADOWS AND NOT REGISTER. WITH THE PORT DISTINCTION IS BILL MAKES IT INCLUDES A DEFINITION OF SHARE. A CROSS KICK IN WHEN YOU SHARE INFO FOR CROSS CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING PURPOSES. WE'VE HAD A FEW PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAMBER AND OTHERS WE'RE IN THIS ISSUE. I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN RESOLVE. HERE BUT WHEN I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING US TO ADDRESS A FEW ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. MAYBE THE LACK OF A CROSS REFERENCE THE CURRENT DATA BREACH LAW. AND STRIKING THE DEADLINE FOR THE PPA TO ISSUE UPDATE REGULATIONS WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THOSE AS COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. CALLING IN TODAY TO SUPPORT THIS JUSTIN BROOKMAN. DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY.

HI THIS IS KELLY CRANDALL FRIEND YEAH AND ON BEHALF OF THE AFFECTED ACLU'S CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY FIRING FOR THE SOUTH THANK YOU THANK YOU. ONE MOMENT PLEASE FOR MORE LIGHTNING KILLS. SEVERAL AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT. ARE YOU MY NAME IS CHRIS TUCKER I AM IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU THE TIME ALREADY LET'S NOT TURN THE OPPOSITION- RUNNING. ALLOW ME IS HERE. IN OPPOSITION. MR LAMMY FORGERS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CHRIS ROCK DAYLAMI WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO SB TEN FIFTY NINE LIKE TO START BY THINKING THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR THE EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD THUS FAR AND FOR THE MOMENTS TAKEN TODAY PARTICULARLY IN PROVIDING FURTHER CLARITY AROUND WHAT ARE CONSIDERED. DISPOSABLE DATA BREACHES UNFORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE SB TEN FIFTY NINE IS UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE AN OVERLY BROAD MOST CONCERNING IS THE BUILD- SIXTY EXPAND THE TERM DATA BROKER TO INCLUDE COMPANIES THAT ARE TO BE BLIND NOT DATA BROKERS. FUNDAMENTALLY DATA BROKERING IS AN ACTIVITY THAT DESCRIBES SELLING DATA AND BECAUSE THE LAW RELIES ON THE CCPA DEFINITION OF SALE WHICH INCLUDES ANY DISCLOSURE THE CONSUMER'S PI. FOR ANY MONETARY OR OTHER VALUABLE CONSIDERATION WE BELIEVE EXISTING DATABROKER DEFINITION ALREADY CAPTURE SUCH ACTIVITIES COMPREHENSIVELY. STATED PLAINLY THERE IS NO GAP HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE CLOSED. ADDING IN BUSINESSES THAT SHARE CONSUMER DATA FOR CROSS CONTEXT BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING WITHOUT ANY MONETARY VALUABLE CONSIDERATIONS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL WOULD MERELY CONFUSE THE SITUATION AND FLOOD THE DATABROKER REGISTRY WOULD NOT DETER BROKERS. FOR EXAMPLE WERE CONCERNED THIS MIGHT REQUIRE REGISTRATION OF A COMPANY THAT DELIVERS AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE IP ADDRESS OF THE CONSUMER THAT INTENTIONALLY INTERACTED WITH THEIR WEBSITE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS I COULD CAPTURE LOYALTY PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW PARTICIPANTS- CONSUMER TAXES DIFFERENT BRANDS USING THEIR POINTS GATHERED THROUGH INTERACTIONS WITH ONE RETAILER WITH ANOTHER RETAILER AND SUCH EXAMPLES THE CONSUMER KNOWS WHICH BUSINESSES TO CONTACT EXERCISE OR CCP WRITES WITHOUT FURTHER ASSISTANCE. SO IF ANYTHING WE BELIEVE THIS OVERLY BROAD DEFINITION UNDERMINES THE UTILITY OF THE REGISTRY FOR THE CONSUMER. LASTLY GIVEN OUR LIMITED TIME ALL SIMPLY REFERRED HER LETTER REGARDING CONCERNS OVER ADDING RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE NEW PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY. AND OVER THE POSSIBILITY AT THAT DUPLICATE DISCLOSURES ON THE REGISTER REGISTRY COULD INADVERTENTLY CAUSE UNNECESSARY CONFUSION IF THEY ARE NOT UPDATED IN A TIMELY FASHION. EXCUSE ME. SOMETHING THAT BUSINESSES CANNOT NECESSARILY CONTROL WHAT THE GOVERNMENT RUN REGISTRY FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS THE ALARMING. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED. I DON'T OFTEN ON BEHALF OF TECH THAT WE ARE ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU. MARGARET LATCHING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OSCAR SORIANO POSES BILL THANK YOU. OTHERS IN ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED SAYING NO WHEN APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE NO ONE ELSE PROTEIN MICROPHONE LET'S NOW TURN TO THE PHONE LINE OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO SB. ONE ZERO FIVE NINE YOUR NAME YOUR FILIATION IN YOUR POSITION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DISRUPTED THE TRANSFER OF THE ONE ZERO FIVE NINE. ONE POINT ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. THIS. YEAH BUT THIS TIME WE HAVE A ROLLING SUITCASE ALL RIGHT- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NO MICROPHONES RAISED NO QUESTIONS NO COMMENTS- COUPLE EURO. SO THERE WERE SOME ISSUES RAISED BY BY THE CHAMBER AND SOME OF THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS CAN YOU ADDRESS- HOW ARE YOU YOU KNOW YOUR FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING ON- IT'S READ AND PART OF THAT I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR ME IS YOU KNOW WE PASS THE CCPA SO THAT THEY COULD WORK ON REGULATIONS IN SETTING UP THE FRAMEWORK. AND THEN. YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH. THAT ARE CHANGING IT BEFORE IT'S EVEN FINISHED I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT IN SO IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. YOU THINK SEVEN WE BELIEVE THIS IS REALLY IN SYNC WITH IT. THIS THE S. C. P. R. A. TECH THIS IS THE SHARING LOOPHOLE WAS TO BE SACKED WHEN THAT WAS CLOSED WHEN CCPA. WAS UPGRADED WITH PROP TWENTY FOUR. TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THIS EFFECTIVE T. C. IN ITS DEFINITION OF DATABROKER INCLUDES. SHARING BUT UNFORTUNATELY- A LOT OF DATA BROKERS ARE SURE USING. THIS LOOPHOLE AND SAYING THAT THEY DON'T GET VALUABLE CONSIDERATION- AND SO THERE FOR USE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT REGISTER SO. THE CAR WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY IS THAT. THAT NEAR USE CASE WHEN YOU AND I ARE BEING TRACKED AND TARGETED FOR ADS ON THE WEB. BASED SOLELY ON OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WHEN I CALLED. CROSS CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING SAID THAT'S THE ONLY CASE. THAT IRAQIS WERE JUST CLARIFYING THAT THAT- IS. EQUAL TO SHARING. AND AGAIN IF YOU HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMER AT THAT'S FINE. YOU CAN STILL DO ALL THIS AND I THINK MANY OF THE- CONCERNS I THINK ARE MARCHING IN THAT RESPECT. IF YOU WOULD DIRECT RELATIONSHIP THAT'S FINE WHICH SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. PERSON THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE INTERACT WITH AS A CONSUMER. IF THEY ARE THEN SHARING THAT THEY SHOULD BE COVERED. SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT STATION HERE. RIGHT SIR MICHAEL SKI DO WE HAVE WE USED A FOR PURPOSES OF MOVIE THE BILL BECAUSE I LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT APPROPRIATE TIME ALL RIGHT LET'S LET'S DO THAT- SENATOR BOOKER IF YOU'LL INDULGE IS FOR ONE MOMENT- MEANT TO COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE RULE FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A QUORUM FOR PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A QUORUM UMBERG HERE A BREAK HERE PORGES.

SENATE BILL FOURTEEN NINETEENWAS INTRODUCED IN RESPONSE TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT I'VE GIVEN PATIENTS I'M PRESIDENT ACCESS TO THEIR OWN HEALTH INFORMATION. THE INTENT OF THIS REGULATION IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND THAT IT ALLOWS PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN COORDINATING THEIR OWN CARE. BUT THE RULE IS ALSO SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY IN MY FIELD OF PEDIATRICS. CLINICAL NOTES WHICH PATIENTS NOW HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE OFTEN CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION. THE PATIENT MIGHT NOT WANT SHARED.

I WANT TO GROUND OR SOMETHING. ILLEGAL BY TWO FOUR SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THANK YOU HELLO NO ADDITIONAL LINE TO QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS JUST CENTER BURGESS. THE CATCHER- MAYBE JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION- SO WE MAKE A MINOR. HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROVIDER- DOES THE PRIVITY WITH THE INSURANCE POLICY RESTS WITH THE PARENTS. OR IS IT SEPARATE BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE PHYSICIAN. MAYBE IT'S A ADAM THIS WE NEED TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT IF MAYBE IF ANYBODY CAN ANSWER THAT. YES YOU ACTUALLY PASSED MY WITNESS TO COMMENT BECAUSE ALSO ON THE OTHER PIECE I THINK THAT THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IS MOSTLY REALLY EXIST ARE ALREADY EXISTING LAW WHICH ADDING CLINICAL NOTES BUT IF I COULD ASK- DETERGENT THANK YOU IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SO. JUST T CLARIFY THIS THIS IS POINTING TO STATE LAW THAT'S ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AROUND SENSITIVE SERVICES FOR MINORS. AND IT'S VERY NARROW IN TERMS OF WHAT'S PROTECTED AND THAT AND THE INTENT OF THIS IS NOT- I'LL GET YOUR QUESTION ABOUT INSURANCE. AND THE INTENT AROUND THIS IS NOT TO- IT TO EXCLUDE PARENTS FROM THE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN- PARENTS ARE INCREDIBLY TRUSTED- AND SO IMPORTANT AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND YET THERE'S SOME SENSITIVE SERVICES THAT IF THEY'RE A IF THE YOUTH IS NOT GUARANTEED THAT THEY'LL BE SOME PRIVACY. THEY WON'T DISCLOSE AND DISCUSS WITH ME OR ANYONE POSSIBLY- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. SEPARATE FROM THIS- WAS WAS PUT INTO PLACE FOR WAS JUST TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE IS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ASK A TRUSTED ADULT WHO HAS A RELATIONSHIP IN THAT FAMILY- ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT THEY MAY NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DISCUSSING. AND I ALWAYS- ENCOURAGED THAT WE BRING THAT CONVERSATION BACK TO THE PARENTS. AND OFTEN OFFER TO HELP AND MOST OF THE TIME THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO THEN. RETURN BACK INTO THAT THAT ME THE CHILD AND THE PARENTS. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INSURANCE WHAT IT HAPPENED WHEN THE SENSE OF SERVICES WORK I. PUT IN IS THAT IT GOT CARVED OUT FROM TRADITIONAL INSURANCE AND SO MEDIKAL HAS PROTECTION AROUND SENSITIVE SERVICES. SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE BILLING ON THE BACKEND WHERE YOU'VE ALLOWED SOME CONFIDENTIALITY AND THEN UNINTENDED LEE- DISCLOSED THROUGH BILLING. AND SO THAT'S THE WAY THE INSURANCE PIECE HAS BEEN- HANDLED WITH THE EXISTING LAW. ANY OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY IS THAT- THE TECHNOLOGY HAS THE ABILITY. TO DOCUMENT THE- ALL THE INFORMATION THAT'S NOT. UNDER THE SENSITIVE SERVICES AND RELEASE AN OPEN NOTES AND HAVE THIS OTHER SENSITIVE- INFORMATION KEPT IN A SEPARATE AREA SO ONLY THAT WOULD BE WOULD BE BLOCKED. IF THE TEEN WANTED IT- SO THAT OPT OUT ACTUALLY IS AND OUR SIDE THE OPT IN TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY FROM FROM NINETEEN. IS AVAILABLE IN CURRENT TECHNOLOGY OF MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION. THANK YOU I'M THANK YOU I THINK. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES WHERE YOU. CAN YOU SCRATCH YOUR HEAD A LITTLE BIT ON. YES YOU WANT INDIVIDUALS- TO SEEK AND OBTAIN MEDICAL TREATMENT YOU KNOW. AS AS IT'S NEEDED- AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU KNOW MAYBE A PARENT- WOULD DISAPPROVE. BUT I KIND OF HARKENS TO. OTHER ISSUES THAT WE DEALT WITH WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AN ADULT. IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST RUN THE GAMUT MAN. I MEAN YOU GOT TO BE TWELVE TO GET CERTAIN SERVICES YOU GOT TO BE. SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN TO JOIN THE MILITARY. PERHAPS YOUNGER WITH PARENTAL SO- CONSENT. YOU HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW SIXTEEN NOW TO VOTE HE USED TO BE EIGHTEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TWENTY ONE TO. TO DRINK ALCOHOLIC WORKERS ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO I GUESS THE IDEA IS. AND I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS A PERSON OUT THERE TO GET AND I WANT AND I WANT. I WANT TO KNOW THAT. WHEN THEY'RE GETTING SERVICES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE SPECIAL SERVICES IN THE CAR ABOUT. I THINK IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW. JUST TO A FATHER'S PERSPECTIVE I SUPPOSE. YEAH I APPRECIATE YOUR- THOUGHTFUL REMARKS IN A PORSCHE YOU KNOW JUST IN THIS PART OF THE BILL IS- WITNESS MENTIONED- ACTUALLY EXISTING LAW ARE WE REALLY ARE ADDING THE THIS IS CAN ONE PIECE THIS BILLS THAT THAT'S CLINICAL NOTES TO- THAT PART THAT'S THAT'S PROTECTED SO THAT PART IS REALLY ALREADY PART OF. OF CALIFORNIA ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A CLARIFICATION BUT WE DO THINK THOSE CLINICAL NOTES I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT WE DO THINK THAT CONNOTES ARE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT AS PART OF THIS. RT THANK YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS IS A MOVE BY SEN WHITEHOUSE SKI. IT'S I'M OF THE BILL NO IT'S A COUPLE EURO JUST TO BE SURE THAT IT'S BEEN PROPERLY MOST CYNICAL YOU'RE ALSO MOVES THE BILL- YES- SIR BECKER YOU COULD CLOSE. IT OUT OR USE THAT SICKNESS. A VOICE IS REMOVED AND WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT AND WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT THE PATIENT- PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT MECHANISMS PROVIDED BY THE BROWN ACT WE JUST ASK IF YOU ACCEPT AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THIS. HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT MECHANISMS PROVIDED BY THE BROWN ACT TO DEAL WITH DISRUPTIONS DURING BROWN ACTED PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE INSUFFICIENT. ACROSS CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC ATTENDEES CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH DISORDERLY CONDUCT DURING MEETINGS AT SUCH A HIGH MAGNITUDE THAT CRITICAL BUSINESS AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AS A WHOLE HAVE BECOME IMPAIRED REPEATED. DOUBLE SURE ONLY A FEW EXAMPLES THAT SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR S. B. ELEVEN HUNDRED I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF SIMILAR INSTANCES IN MANY OF YOUR OWN SENATE DISTRICTS. WELL IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLUS GET US MAYOR RICO SALE IN OUR FAMILY AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL FACE DISRUPTIVE ACTIONS TARGET BULLYING AND HARASSMENT EFFORTS AT PUBLIC MEETINGS. INCLUDING AN ANTI LGBTQ AND ANTI. API RHETORIC THIS YEAR AND LAST THE POTENTIAL YORBA LINDA UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD HAD IN MULTIPLE MEETINGS EARLY DUE TO MEETING DISRUPTIONS RECENT SAN DIEGO BOARD OF SUPERVISOR MEETINGS HAVE ALSO MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES IN PART DUE TO RACIST COMMENTS AS WELL AS THREATS OF VIOLENCE. IN PERSONAL ATTACKS WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND THE NEED FOR CLARITY OF WHAT THE FORTY- LET'S SEE THE BODY CAN EXERCISE IN REGARD TO REMOVING AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S DISRUPTING A PUBLIC MEETING DUE IN PART TO THE WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF. LEGAL COUNSELS THAT TOURNEY'S ACROSS THE STATE AS WE HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY SEEN MANY TROUBLING INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING HARASSMENT AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE NEED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC MEETING ACCESS BY MODERNIZING THE PRODUCTS. THAT IT PROVIDES CLEAR STANDARD AROUND ONE. FOR MEETING PART IS WARRANTED AND WHAT AUTHORITY OF OUR- BODY CONNECTIONS. THE STATE MUST SET A BARE MINIMUM. BY ESTABLISHING COMMON SENSE MECHANISMS TO DE ESCALATE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS. HELLO MEMBERS OF LEGISLATIVE BODY TO RETURN TO THEIR IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL BUSINESS IN A SWIFT MANNER. THIS BILL WOULD ENHANCE PUBLIC ACCESS TO MEETINGS. I WILL NOTE THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ACLU AND OTHERS. INCLUDING LEGAL COUNSELS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES WHO ARE HIGHLY ESTEEMED. ACROSS AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENT WITH FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES AND EXPRESSLY STATED OUR INTENT TO PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND NOT TO PROHIBIT PUBLIC CRITICISM.

IN TO HELP US ADDRESS AND UNFORTUNATE BUT NOTABLE INCREASE IN DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR THAT IS PRESENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF INTERRUPTING THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS. A REGRETTABLY EVEN HERE IN THE CAPITAL INCIDENTS OF THIS TYPE HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS. THEY'RE STRESSFUL THEY'RE DEMORALIZING AND OFTEN FRIGHTENING FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS STAFF AND THOSE IN ATTENDANCE- THESE BEHAVIORS NOT ONLY DISRUPT THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY BUT FUNDAMENTALLY BREAK THE PROMISE OF THE BROWN ACT. UNDERMINING THE ABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS SAFELY AND PRODUCTIVELY. S. B. ELEVEN HUNDRED PROVIDES HELPFUL GUIDANCE FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AS TO HOW TO MANAGE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH CASE LAW.

WE ALL KNOW THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THE BROWN ACT BUT IT'S NOT JUST ONE SIDED THERE IS PROBLEMS WITH ENFORCING THE BROWN ACT AND ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO HAVE ACCESS. TO MEETINGS OF ALL TYPES FROM SCHOOL BOARDS TO STATE MEETINGS AT EERY LEVEL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IF WE DO NOT WE DO NOT HAVE DUE PROCESS OF LAW WE DO NOT HAVE DEMOCRACY. AND THE LAST TWO YEARS EVERYONE OF US ACROSS THIS NATION HAS LIVED WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE LOCKED OUT OF THE PROCESS- AROUND RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT WORKS THAT AFFECTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US FROM OUR CHILDREN TO OUR ELDERS TO OUR BUSINESSES EVERY PART OF SOCIETY. AND THERE WAS A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN. IN THE BROWN ACT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO KEEP AN OPEN CHANNEL FOR ELECTIVES AND THE KINGS AND THE CITIZENS AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN I THINK WHAT THIS BILL NEEDS TO BE. COMPLETELY STOPPED PUT ASIDE AND LET'S LOOK AT HOW FROM ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE TOGETHER LOOK AT HOW TO SOLVE THE BREAK DOWN. IN THE LEASES OF THE CHILDREN THE BUSINESS'S THE CHURCHES THE ELDERS EVERYONE ONE THING YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS NOBODY'S VOICE WAS HEARD. AND IF YOU LOCK PEOPLE OUT FURTHER BY THIS YOU ARE ONLY ADDING INSULT TO INJURY THE TIME WHERE EVERYONE DESERVES A VOICE AT THE TABLE AND ALL ANYONE WAS CRYING FOR WAS TO BE HEARD. AND BE PART OF A SOLUTION TOGETHER AND THIS DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE IT'S REALLY REALLY ACTUALLY SHAMEFUL AND PAINFUL FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HURTING FOR TWO YEARS. AND I WASN'T PREPARED. TO SPEAK IN THIS I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. THIS THIS BILL. AMONG MANY OTHERS ARE SENSUALLY FUNCTIONING A SECRET BILLS THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THEM. AND IF YOU WERE TO GO OUT AND PULL YOUR COMMUNITY IF YOU WERE TO GO OUT AND HOLD A TOWN HALL YOU WOULD FIND THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS AND THEY DO CARE. THEY WANT A VOICE THEY WANT TO BE HEARD AND THAT'S ALL ANYONE'S ASKING NO MATTER WHAT POSITION THEY'RE IN.

WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSE WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT PARENTS TO JUST BE QUIET THAT TAX PAYERS SHOULD JUST BE QUIET AND RIGHT NOW WE JUST LEFT A MEETING. WHERE WE WERE TOLD TO FOLLOW THE F. ING RULES. WHY IS IT THAT REPRESENTATIVES ARE ALLOWED TO TALK TO US THIS WAY. BUT WHEN WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN SCHOOLS WHEN WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR REPRESENTATIVES WHY CERTAIN POLICIES ARE BEING PLACED IN SECRET BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE COMMUNITY CANVASSING AND PEOPLE DO. NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. WHY IS THIS BUILD PUT INTO. OF ACTUAL COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE AND OPENING UP THOSE LINES TO PEOPLE WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN CIVICS.

HI MY NAME IS VANESSA SANTOS I LIVE IN SENECA COUNTY AND I STRONGLY OPPOSE IT. THANK YOU FOUR TIMES WITH NO ADDITIONAL IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT- LOOK LET ME JUST DISCUSS THE ORDER OF BUSINESS HERE SO- THIS IS GOING TO BE THE LAST BILL WE'RE GETTING HERE BEFORE- OUR NOON OF WHERE WE ARE IN OUR NOON RECESS WHERE WE HAVE TO ATTEND OTHER ACTIVITIES- WILL BE BACK AT ONE THIRTY- BUT BEFORE WE LEAVE AT NOON I'M GONNA OPEN THE ROLE ON ALL THE OUTSTANDING MEASURES. SO GO BACK TO SLEEP. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET A MOVE- YES AND WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO- I BELIEVE HIS FILE AND NUMBER TWO CONSIDERING CENTER ACTUALLY IT IS BUILT. ALL RIGHT. SO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SIR BARGES. THANK YOU SURE. I TELL YOU I HAVE NEVER SEEN. FOLKS RESPOND WITH SUCH A LACK OF CIVILITY DECORUM HI IN- LOCAL AFFAIRS OR EVEN STATE AFFAIRS FRANKLY FEDERAL AS WELL- SO THIS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE RESONATES WITH ME- THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN YOU HAVE COME TO EXPECT. IN OUR REPRESENTATIVE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL IN MAKE THEIR OPINIONS KNOWN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE LEGISLATIVE BODIES. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE INTIMIDATION THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HARASSMENT THAT IS NOT INCLUDING CIRCLING INDIVIDUALS IN KEEPING THEM FROM ACCESSING OR LEAVING A BUILDING OR GETTING INTO THEIR CAR OR PROTESTING IN FRONT OF THEIR HOMES. I'VE SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL LEVEL INVOLVES YOU'RE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT PUSH THE ENVELOPE. IN THEIR ORDER IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT THERE'S A BALANCE HERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE IS UNDERTAKING THIS WHEN LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THEIR BEST DISCRETION TO REMOVE INDIVIDUALS HERE TODAY ARE ELEVATING THEIR CONDUCT IN SUCH A WAY. SO MAYBE I CAN THROW THAT OUT THERE IS A QUESTION TO THAT I FEEL THAT THERE IS IMPORTANCE TO THIS MESSAGE. BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT THIS IS A STATE RULE THAT NEEDS TO BE PROMULGATED WHEN JURISDICTION EXISTS ELSEWHERE. US SECRETARY Z. FOR PROCEDURE COMMON CENTER INTO. THE ISSUE IS THAT THE BROWN ACT IS. HAS BEEN IN IT IS CALLED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HERE TAKES LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO CLARIFY OR MODIFY IT AT ALL DESPITE THE FACT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH CERTAIN AREAS OF DECORUM IN IN BASIC RULES OF CONDUCT AND SO FORTH SO- THIS THIS BILL IS GOING TO YOUR COMMENTS OF JOST. IT MAY BE EVEN MORE NARROWLY DEFINED IN YOUR COMMENTS ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT- YEAH DISALLOWING MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR AS TO WHEN YOU CAN DISALLOW THE WILLFUL DESTRUCTION OF THE MEETING- RENDERING A MEETING IN FEASIBLE AS THIS. IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GONNA WORK. CHRIS BUT- TO PUT THOSE CLARIFICATIONS INTO LAW- WE HAVE TO START WITH THE BROWN ACT. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M SORRY I FULLY APPRECIATED AND I'VE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME DEALING WITH THE BROWN ACT AT. MUNICIPAL INC AND COUNTY LEVELS. THIS IS A MATTER OF THIS IS A TRUE MATTER OF LOCAL CONTROL. CLARIFYING WHAT IS ALLOWABLE THROUGH THE BROWN ACT THE BROWN ACT IS OPEN DISCLOSURE OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS. DECORUM SETTING. IT LOOSE LARGELY DECIDED BY THE CHAIR FOR THAT RESPECTIVE BODY. AND SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE USE OF STATE POWER- TO- TO GIVE LOCALS WHAT THEY HAVE INHERENTLY THAT GUYS RESPECTFULLY PUT THAT OUT THERE. FOR YOU. JANUARY THANK YOU- YES SERVERS FOR NIXON CENTER LAYER. I WANT TO- ECHO- COMMENT MADE IN THE LAST COMMITTEE WAS THAT GOVERN FINANCE I BELIEVE IT WAS WITH SENATOR WIENER I THINK CUT TO THE CHASE AND REALLY ELEGANTLY- I MADE THE POINT ABOUT THIS BILL. WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF IT HEARING PROCESS TO- DISCUSS DEMOCRACY TO HAVE EVERYBODY'S POINTS SHOULD BE TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND TO AVOID FOLKS INTERRUPTING THAT DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATIVE pPROCESS EVERYBODY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTEST DISCUSSION ANYWAY THEN THEY THEY WANT TO MAKE IT HOME FOR A- CENTER WHERE TO FURTHER MAKE THIS POINT BREAK JUST **** PERMISSION BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MAKES THE POINT ELEGANTLY. IN THE SENSE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY PRO DEMOCRACY AT ITS GREATEST BECAUSE FOLKS COME INTO A ROOM AND THEY IN FACT WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE DILUTES THE DELIBERATION- AND NOT. MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION SO. SHORT AT THAT THOUGHT. GLAZER HERTZBERG SAID EARLIER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO RESPOND TO A PREVIOUS COMMENT BECAUSE- IT WAS STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE PERSON PRESIDING AT THE MEETING IT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I WAS EXACTLY THAT PERSON. I WAS THE MAYOR. AT A TIME. THAT A FULL ROOM LIKE THIS SHOUTED US DOWN FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF IN A BUDGET HEARING. AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY ADVISED US WE HAD NO RECOURSE BUT TO ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE. WE COULDN'T HEAR BETWEEN US WHAT WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC STANDING AT THE PODIUM THAT COULD BARELY AND GENERALLY NOT BE HEARD. BY US AND OUR ATTORNEY ADVISED US WE HAD NO RECOURSE. AND SO. WHEN IT IS SAID THAT THAT A CHAIR OF A OF A MEETING COULD COULD DO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT RIGHT AND I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THE END IN THE KEY ISSUE WILL BE AS THIS BILL MOVES IS HOW YOU DRAW THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND DISRUPTION AND ENDED AT THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS HAVE GONE ADDED IN A GOOD WAY AND MAYBE THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS. BUT THERE WAS NOT THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I CAN'T DESCRIBE. I'VE HAD THAT MANY WEIRD MOMENTS IT IS FOUR OR ELECTED THING OVER THE SPAN OF FORTY YEARS BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST BECAUSE- YOU JUST POWERLESS YOU JUST BEING COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN YOU HAD NO CONTROL. THERE WAS NO RESPECT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THAT WAS NOT EXPRESSING AN OPINION THAT WAS NOT A COMMENT THAT WAS AT A PODIUM IT WAS JUST LITERALLY SHOUTED THE ENTIRE TIME AND SO. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL. IS ADDRESSING. THANK YOU SIR- JONES CENTER WHAT CAL SKI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE FOR. YOUR TIME. VERY STRONG DIALOGUE- THERE ARE SOME THINGS IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS ACT I DO AGREE WITH- YOU MENTIONED THAT THESE CASES ARE LIMITED AND RARE AND I WOULD I THINK THAT THAT'S I THINK THAT'S TRUE ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CYCLE AS THOSE LIMITED A RARE OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN SENSATIONALIZED BY THE MEDIA BY ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND HAS DEVOLVED TO THOSE SITUATIONS ARE ELEVATED MAYBE MIGHT BE A BETTER TERM TWO ELSEWHERE. PEOPLE ARE ASSUMING THAT THAT'S THE GENERAL THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THESE MEETINGS I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE- I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED- WITH THE BROWN ACT AND WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. I DO WANT TO BE IN A RECOGNIZE THE TWO SPEAKERS THAT SPOKE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I THOUGHT THAT THE VERY ELOQUENTLY AND GRACIOUSLY PRESENTED THEIR POSITION TODAY. BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS. THE NUMBER ONE TOOL WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION IN THESE PUBLIC MEETINGS. AND IN CENTER LEARNED NOT TO BE SNARKY WIT. IF I GET A NEW CITY ATTORNEY YOU KNOW IF THAT WAS MY SITUATION- AND I'VE BEEN ON THE CITY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A CITY COUNCIL- WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW MY THE CITY THAT HAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL WE HAD A SPLIT IN THE CITY BETWEEN. FOLKS THAT WANTED THE CITY TO DEVELOP AND FOLKS THAT DIDN'T WANT THE CITY TO DEVELOP AND- WHEN THERE WAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COMING UP. YOU KNOW WE GOT A VERY HEATED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT I'M OFTEN AMAZED BY THE FORESIGHT AND THE INTELLECT OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WHEN THEY WROTE THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION THEY WROTE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE PEACEABLY TO ASSEMBLE AND TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GOVERNMENT GRIEVANCES. I JUST IMAGINE IF WHEN THEY WROTE THAT LEFT OUT THE WORD PEACEABLE. AND I THINK ALL OF OUR MEETINGS AND ALL OF OUR INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC HINGED ON THAT ONE WORD PEACEABLE. AND AS SOON AS I THINK THAT'S THE GOVERNING CONCEPT. IN THESE MEETINGS AS LONG AS THE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC AT THESE MEETINGS IS PEACEABLE. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE HAVE A DUTY. TO STAY THERE AND LISTEN AS LONG AS IT TAKES. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT AS SOON AS THE THAT TURNOUT BECOMES UNFEASIBLE. THE PRESIDING OFFICER OF THAT MEETING HAS THE AUTHORITY AND THE DUTY. TO REMOVE THOSE ON PEACEABLE MEMBERS FROM THAT ASSEMBLY AND I THINK IT'S IS CLEAR IN AS CLEAN AS THAT- AND I'LL WRAP UP WITH THIS I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME FRUSTRATION FROM THE PUBLIC IN DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AT THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME OF KOBE HAD WITH. YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE ONLY STATE YOUR NAME AND ONLY STATE YOUR POSITION. BUT THERE'S FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL FORTY MILLION PEOPLE HAVE THAT RIGHT TO COME AND SPEAK TO US ON THIS DYESS. BUT IT IS IT'S NOT TENABLE FOR US TO GIVE EVERYBODY. THREE MINUTES OR TWO MINUTES OR WHATEVER. SO I'M GOING WITH THIS IS FOR THE PUBLIC YOU'RE NOT LIMITED TO TWO YEARS SPEECH HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ROOM. AND EXCHANGING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OR ANY COMMITTEE YOU HAVE. ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE TIME THE BILL COMES TO THE COMMITTEE TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THERE THROUGH THEIR EMAIL THROUGH THEIR DISTRICT OFFICE TO THEIR PHONE. DON'T LIMIT DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST LIMITED TO YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION HERE- USE THE RESOURCES THAT THE SENATE PROVIDES YOU THROUGH OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD YOU KNOW TO WRAP IT UP TO SOME RISE I THINK THE FIRST AMENDMENT TAKES CARE OF THIS. PROBLEM WHERE THERE MIGHT BE HE IS IN OUR CHALLENGE THE FIRST MEMBER DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF IT TIGHTENED CERTAINLY BELIEVE THE BROWN ACT AS- AND- I ALSO WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TAKES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR JONES OTHERS TELLICO SKI. MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MOVE FEE- MATTER BUT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BALANCING THE RIGHT TO DO OUR BUSINESS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PEOPLE HAVE. WE CAN'T FORGET THE OTHER PART OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHICH GIVES MEMBERS THE FIRST MEMBER RIGHT TO. PETITION THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S SORT OF WHAT'S NOT BEING LEFT OUT HERE SO I. WISH YOU GOOD LUCK GOING FORWARD AND WILL. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS- CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I ALSO JUST I HOPE IT DOESN'T GET LOST THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THAT IT'S ABOUT TWO THINGS IT'S ABOUT THE ABILITY OF. DECISION MAKERS TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDERING THE ISSUE AND CAST THEIR VOTE. BASED ON THE MERITS AND FEEDBACK THEY'RE GETTING AND NOT BASED ON A FEAR. THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE- BASICALLY ON RASTATT HEARING AND ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AND FRANKLY BULLYING. BEHAVIOR WE DON'T WANT ELECTED OFFICIALS DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL WE WANT WE DON'T WANT THEM MAKING DECISIONS. BECAUSE OF FEAR. OF WHAT IS HAPPENING PHYSICALLY- IN A CITY HALL OR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU CAN BE SUPER RIGHT WINGER SUPER LEFT WING OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN THAT'S GOOD THAT'S DEMOCRACY. AT A TERMS OF REPRESENTATION BUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE EVER TO HAVE IN THEIR HEAD WILL IF I CAST THIS VOTE. IS THAT GONNA MAKE EVERYONE. SO UNSETTLED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SITUATION THAT'S NOT DEMOCRACY. THAT'S MOB RULE. AND THAT IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE RUNNING A DEMOCRACY ANYWHERE IN THE REDDEST COUNTY OR THE PLUMAS COUNTY. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I HAVE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GO AND MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT OR THEY WANT TO GO MADE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. BECAUSE THEY ARE. THEIR FEAR ABOUT HOW OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE GOING TO REACT TO THEM. AND THERE FOR AND THIS IS YOU KNOW EVEN THAT AND VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. AND I SHOULD NEVER BE THAT WAY NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE SCARED TO GO AND MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE FEARFUL TO THIS ASSEMBLY CLARIFYING- IN THE BROWN ACT BECAUSE THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE BOUND BY THE BROWN ACT. AND IF THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY EVEN THEN THEY COULD GET SUED. AND THEY COULD LOSE AND WE WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO THIS IS A VERY IS A PRO DEMOCRACY MEASURE. BECAUSE LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR WHERE YOU ARE DECISION MAKER WHETHER YOU'RE A STATE SENATOR REPRESENTING A MILLION PEOPLE OR CITY COUNCIL MEMBER REPRESENTING TWENTY THOUSAND OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. YOU REPRESENT AND ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT A LOT TO DO. NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO CAME IN AT THE TIME. TO CALM AND MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME TO COME. AS WE START YELLING OR GAZING UP INTO THE INTERESTING BEHAVIOR YOU REPRESENT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT HEARING IS HAPPENING. THEY'RE WORKING THREE JOBS AND TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A- THANK YOU SIR WIENER OTHER COMMENTS- CENTER STERN. YEAH JUST VERY BRIEFLY WANTED I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS BRAVERY IN BRINGING THIS FORWARD- AND WE KNOW WHEN. WHEN YOU COME FOR THE MEASURE LIKE THIS. WE'RE GOING TO GET ANGRY AND- AND IT TAKES COURAGE ESPECIALLY SOMEONE SERVED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL TO BRING THIS DISCUSSION FORWARD I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE ANALYSIS WELL THE TEXT OF THE BILL ON THIS IS NOT AN OPEN ENDED- REQUIREMENT THE DIFF THE DEFINITION OF DISRUPTION ITSELF BRINGS IN THE NOTION OF THE USE OF FORCE OR TRUE THREATS OF FORCE SO. TERMS THE COMMENT ABOUT PEACE ABILITY OF THESE OF THESE AND- OF THIS OF THIS SPEECH I THINK THE BILL TAILORS ITSELF NARROWLY TO THAT- AND THEREFORE IN MY VIEW. SHOULD MEET THE CONSTITUTIONAL THRESHOLD AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT SAID THE NINTH CIRCUIT. ON THE ONE THING I WANT TO SAY THE WITH THE WITH WITH VOTING ON THIS BILL I DO THINK WE SHOULD OBLIGATE OURSELVES. TO LOOKING FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC. I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE REMOTE HEARING PARTICIPATION IS GOING TO SEIZE- AFTER THIS PANDEMIC. AND THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ATTEND MEETINGS CAN BE LIMITED BASED ON INCOME OR WHEN THEY ARE WORKING PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE AND CAN'T GO TO A MEETING. WE HAD LEGISLATION PENDING FOR THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AB THREE THIRTY. OUR HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER BILL COMING BACK- THIS YEAR AGAIN AB NINETEEN FORTY FOUR FROM THE ASSEMBLY BUT- LOOKING AT EXPANDING THAT ACCESS SO. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE PEACE STABILITY. AND HAVING SOME KIND OF MODICUM OF SAFETY WHEN PEOPLE ARE. TRYING TO GOVERNOR TRYING TO TESTIFY WE ALSO PARTNER AN OBLIGATION TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I THINK THERE ARE OPPRTUNITIES TO DO THAT BOTH ON DIGITAL PLATFORMS WHERE PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE THOSE WHO COULDN'T GET ALL THE WAY TO SACRAMENTO TODAY BUT MAYBE ON THESE FACEBOOK FEEDS OR WHATEVER MAYBE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TESTIFY TO. IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT SOUTHWEST LATER EVEN GET DOWNTOWN MAY DAY- SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS LEGISLATURE OBLIGATE ITSELF WITH. IF WE DO END UP MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD- WITH A COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS WHILE WE ENSURE- SECURITY IN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BEING PROTECTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER STERN ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO BE HEARD SINGING UP NO ONE ELSE- ALL RIGHT- THERE'S BEEN A MOTION BY SENATE WHITE HOUSE YOU ONE FINAL POINT- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS BUT BUT- COUNTRY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM- SEVERAL. OF US CAN READ AND SO. IF THOSE WHO WISH TO EXPRESS THEIR POINT OF VIEW WHICH TO DO SO IN WRITING- THEY CAN SUBMIT THOSE TO THE SENATE WEBSITE- AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE AND WE DO- TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. THOSE WRITTEN COMMENTS AS WELL SO. HAVING SAID THAT. THE CENTRE CORTESE NUCLEAR CLOSE. HERE SO I'M SURE IT'LL BE A BRIEF CLOSING FIRST FULL TO ME THANK YOU AND THE COMMITTEE FOR- REALLY PRODUCTIVE ASSISTANCE- GETTING TO THIS POINT APPRECIATE THAT- AND- APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR- COMMITTEE HEARING- LOTS OF GOOD AND IMPORTANT STUFF TO STE. SAYING THAT WOULD REALLY BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT WE ARE AT SOME POINT DEALING WITH CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES HERE- THE BILL'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY WELL THAT IT- I JUST WANT TO SAY IN AND NOT TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE BUT TO RESPOND IN MY CLOTHES- THE BROWN ACT IS NOT CLEAR IF THAT THE PRESIDING OFFICER. CAN TAKE THOSE ACTIONS WHICH WERE. WHICH WERE SPOKEN TO EARLIER- BUT ONE OF THE SENATORS WERE CLEARING THAT UP HERE- WE'RE SEEING THE PRIVATE PRESIDING OFFICER. KEENAN TAKE THOSE ACTIONS- IT IT'S IT NOT ONLY A BIG USE THE PRODUCT CURRENTLY BUT IF ANYTHING IT SAYS THAT THE ENTIRE BODY WOULD HAVE TO VOTE- TO TAKE AN ACTION. YOU KNOW IN A THREATENING SITUATION ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF IMPORTANT CLEAN UP IN. REALLY EFFICIENCY AND CLARITY THAT'S GOING ON HERE THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL- THAT ENCROACHES ON. THE CONTENT OF WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY NOTHING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I APPRECIATED THE OPPOSITION I APPRECIATE HEARING IT TODAY. IT CAUSES ME TO THINK IT CAUSES ME TO REFLECT THAT THINK IT CAUSES ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO REFLECT ON WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE. THE NEARLY TAILORING THIS APPROACH WELL ENOUGH IN IN IN AND I BELIEVE WE ARE- BUT I LISTENED CAREFULLY I'VE LISTENED CAREFULLY FOR. TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETINGS TO THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF TESTIMONY. NEVER GOT UP AND LEFT OR ABANDONED MY POSITION REGARDLESS OF WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING. THE BILL REFLECTS THAT WHEN WE STARTED. I MADE IT VERY VERY CLEAR TO MY OWN STUFF. THAT THEY WERE TO BE THERE IS TO BE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTENT BASED REGULATION IN THIS BILL WHATSOEVER PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY. PEOPLE ARE NOT TELL TO COME OVER THAT REAL. IT'LL GOVERNMENT MEETING PEOPLE AND I'VE HAD THAT HAPPEN TO BE. A PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO OCCUPY THE MICROPHONE BEYOND REASONABLE TIME PLACE AND MANNER. REGULATIONS AS TO HOW LONG WE ALL KNOW THAT BUT PEOPLE DO THAT. AND THEREFORE DENY EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM. THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE WITH THE HEARING AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE TO THAT. SALUCES EGGS. OF WHAT. BEING DEALT WITH HERE AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE YEAH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE.

AS I ANNOUNCED EARLIER WE HAVE A SPECIAL ORDER- AT ONE THIRTY IS NOW ONE FORTY THREE SO INVITE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO JOIN US- MAN PRO TEM. S. B. THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE SPORTFISHING. WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. WITH SO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. IF YOU WOULD ASK ME THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS MANAGING A CLINIC FIVE AND SERVICES AT A WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINIC. IF I WOULD STILL BE TALKING ABOUT DEFENDING ROE VERSUS WADE AND FIGHTING FOR ABORTION ACCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO UNFORTUNATELY I WOULD HAVE SAID MOST LIKELY. AND THAT IS TRUE STILL TODAY. IN STATE HOUSES IN COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT OUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE BEING STOLEN FROM US. ONCE AGAIN WOMEN ARE BEING PUSHED TO EXTREME MEASURES TO ACCESS ABORTION CARE ONCE AGAIN THERE THEY HAVE ARE THEY FACE HAVING TO PUT THEIR BODIES IN DANGER. THE SUPREME COURT'S IMPENDING DECISION ON A CASE THAT WILL DESTROY ROE VERSUS WADE AND THE REAL REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN AMERICA IS BIGGER THAN THIS ONE BUILT. AND IT HAS A VERY REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF MANY OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. THAT DECISION WILL CARRY THE WEIGHT OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN WHO WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTONOMY OVER THEIR OWN BODIES. IT'S A DECISION THAT WILL IMPACT WOMEN FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COME. IT'S ONE WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR IN EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN AND SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AS PART OF THAT PREPARATION. BY GIVING MORE TRAINED AND QUALIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ABORTIONS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS A PROACTIVE STEP TO FURTHER INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE IS FACING A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS ESPECIALLY. IN SOME OF OUR LATINO BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES A PROBLEM THAT'S EXPECTED TO GET EVEN MORE DIRE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN HAVE CLINICS THAT PROVIDE ABORTIONS. THOSE TWO FACTORS COMBINED MEAN THAT FAR TOO MANY PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED TO CONSIDER ABORTION AS AN OPTION CANNOT DO SO. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A LEADER IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. BUT THE PRACTICAL NEED TO ENSURE REAL ACCESS IS FAR FROM COMPLETE. ONE EARLY STEP I TOOK WAS OFFERING AB ONE FIFTY FOUR IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO EXPAND THE TYPES OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO CAN PERFORM FIRST TERM ABORTIONS WITH SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR TO INCLUDE NURSE PRACTITIONERS. THEN SEVEN YEARS LATER THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB EIGHT NINETY AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD AND IT CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUALIFYING NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. AND NOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE LAWS CAN WORK TOGETHER IN UNISON. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY CAN ALSO PROVIDE FIRST TERM ABORTIONS WITHOUT FISH PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CLARIFY THAT AMONG OTHER CRITERIA NURSE PRACTITIONERS NEED THREE YEARS OF EXPIRY AND- UNDER A PHYSICIAN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY. ACTIVE SHOOTERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE CARE ALLOWING EXPERIENCED NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO UTILIZE THEIR FULL TRAINING AND EDUCATION. WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED REPRODUCTIVE CARE PRACTITIONERS PARTICULARLY IN AREAS LACKING ACCESS TO CARE. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BILLS OFF OF THE SUCCESS OF THESE TWO PRIOR LEGISLATION TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE WHILE ALSO LIFTING UP WORKFORCE OF SKILLED NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND GIVING THEM MORE OPPORTUNITIES CARE FOR THEIR OWN PATIENTS. WHAT TIME SEEMS TO BE MOVING BACKWARD IN MANY PLACES ACROSS THE NATION THIS BILL WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH YOUR PERMISSION I HAVE THOUGHT TO INDIVIDUALS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT CHRISTY WE SAW BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AND DEBBIE BAMBERGER WHO IS A WOMEN'S HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN EAST OAKLAND THANK YOU MA'AM PUT THEM JUST OF BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH- SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION LET ME JUST. A REFRESH EVERYONE'S MEMORY AS TO THE- PROTOCOL HERE SO EACH SIDE ON THIS BILL AND ALL THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE-BEING HEARD THIS AFTERNOON. WILL HAVE- TWO WITNESSES WILL BE PERMITTED TO TESTIFY FOR TWO MINUTES TWO WITNESSES FOR TWO MINUTES ON EACH SIDE. AFTER THAT. WILL TAKE SUPPORT OPPOSITION OF THOSE WHICH SAYS FIND SUPPORT WILL GIVE US THEIR NAME THEIR AFFILIATION AND THE POSITION THE BILL THE SAME GOES FOR THOSE. IN OPPOSITION SO. LET'S BEGIN- WITH- THE PROMISE WE SUBMITS WIESE'S HERE IF YOU TO PRODUCE MICROPHONE THANK YOU THE SWISS THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHRISTIE WEEKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. VERY GRATEFUL TO THE FIRST TIME FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND- AS THE PERSON MENTIONED WE HAVE ONE OF OUR NURSE PRACTITIONERS HERE DEBBIE BAMBERGER AND I'D LIKE TO. HAVE HER COME UP IN HER A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE IN THE SPACE AND- CREATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANKS THANK YOU DECEMBER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR AND DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT BILL IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUE TODAY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE PROTON FOR HER LEADERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO ABORTION SERVICES. MY NAME IS DEBBIE BAMBERGER I'M A WOMEN'S HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN EAST OAKLAND AND A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS MEMBER I'M ALSO ON THE ADVISORY BOARD FOR TEACH WHICH IS TRAINING IN EARLY ABORTION FOR COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. I'VE BEEN A PRACTICING NURSE PRACTITIONER FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AND RECENTLY COMPLETED MY DOCTORATE IN NURSING PRACTICE AT UCSF. IN MY WORK AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD I PROVIDE FAMILY PLANNING GYNECOLOGY AND ABORTION SERVICES BOTH MEDICATION AND ASPIRATION. I WAS THE FIRST NURSE PRACTITIONER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE LEGALLY TRAINED TO DO ASPIRATION ABORTION WHEN SENATOR ATKINS PREVIOUS BILL AB ONE FIFTY FOUR WAS MADE LAW. ALLOWING SUPERVISED AND PEAS PDAS AND NURSE MIDWIVES TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES TO OUR PATIENTS. AT MY CLINIC WE SERVE A DIVERSE URBAN POPULATION WITH PATIENTS COMING FROM ALL SURROUNDING AREAS TO RECEIVE CRITICALLY NEEDED REPRODUCTIVE CARE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A SHORTAGE OF ABORTION PROVIDERS OVER 40% OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN HAVE A- CLINIC THAT PROVIDES ABORTION. AND BECAUSE OF THE ATTACKS ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND IN OTHER STATES I'M ALREADY SEEING PATIENTS FROM TEXAS TRAVELING HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO GET AN ABORTION. PROCEDURE THAT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. SB THIRTEEN SEVEN FIVE INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE CARE BY CONTINUING THE INTENT OF TWO PREVIOUS BILLS AB ONE FIFTY FOUR AND AB EIGHT NINETY. BECAUSE AB EIGHT NINETY GIVE CALIFORNIA AND P. IS THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE WITHOUT PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD BRING THE STATUTE ALLOWING AND PEACE TO PROVIDE FIRST TRIMESTER ABORTIONS. IN LINE WITH ALL OF THE OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SENATOR ATKINS PREVIOUS BILL AB ONE FIFTY FOUR ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND PROVIDERS WHO WILL TRAIN THEM AS MANY OF THE TRAINING PROCEDURES ARE GIVEN TO PHYSICIAN RESIDENTS RATHER THAN OTHER PROVIDERS. THERE'S A PARTICULAR DEARTH OF TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN AREAS LIKE FRESNO BAKERSFIELD AND RIVERSIDE SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES BUT WOULD EXPONENTIALLY GROW THE PROVIDER POOL SINCE EXPERIENCED AND PEAS COULD TRAIN OTHER MPS IN ABORTION SERVICES. THERE IS NO REASON THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER PROCEDURES AND PEAS PROVIDE EVEN BEFORE AB EIGHT NINETY I WAS PROVIDING ABORTION CARE AND SERVING PATIENTS WITH MY SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WAS NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT OFTEN HOURS AWAY I KNOW MY LIMITATIONS. I KNOW WHEN TO CONSULT OTHER PROVIDERS AND I KNOW WHEN TO CALL FOR HELP SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW ME TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES WITHOUT THE UNNECESSARY STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES THAT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF MPS WHO CAN. PRACTICE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW AS TO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED IF YOU APPROACH THE MICROPHONE- THOSE IN SUPPORT.

WHEN LOOKING BACK IT HAS ALWAYS TURNED OUT TO BE A SHAMEFUL TRAVESTY WITH SOCIETY IS WILLING TO INTENTIONALLY DE HUMANIZE AND MISTREAT A GROUP OF HUMAN PEOPLE FOR REASONS OF CONVENIENCE OR FINANCIAL BENEFIT OF ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE.

ALL RIGHT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS ARE COMMON. OF THE RECORDS YOU COULD CLOSE THANK YOU. MISTER I WILL WITH JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS. THERE IS ONE ASPECT OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO PATIENT PROTECTIONS THAT HOT NO ONE RAISED TODAY NOT DIRECTLY. AND ONE UNFORTUNATELY THAT I'M INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH IF THERE ARE NO AVAILABLE QUALIFIED CLINICIANS WILLING OR ABLE TO PROVIDE ABORTION CARE WOMEN WHO NEED ABORTIONS WILL SEEK THEM OUT REGARDLESS. AND THE RESULTS WILL NOT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PATIENT SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION OR THE INDIVIDUALS OR THEIR FAMILIES. WE DO NEED TO EXPLICITLY. AGAIN THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WILL ENABLE EXPERIENCED QUALIFIED TRAINED CERTIFIED PRACTITIONERS TO BOOST OUR REPRODUCTIVE AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. I BROADEN ACCESS TO QUALITY OF CARE. AND ADDRESS THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS USING QUALIFIED TRAINED PRACTITIONERS IN NINE OTHER STATES QUALIFIED AND TRAINED NURSE PRACTITIONERS PROVIDE FIRST TRIMESTER ABORTION WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF PHYSICIANS. CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES MORE HOURS OF TRAINING FORTY SIX HUNDRED. AND YEARS THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE THAT HAS A TRANSITION TO PRACTICE FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN OUR RESPECT OUR OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY BUT CALIFORNIA IS NOT A LEADER YET. NOR AHEAD OF NINE OTHER STATES WHO ALLOW CALTRAIN PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEIR PATIENTS WHO NEED ACCESS. TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AN ABORTION WE CAN CHANGE THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I CAUGHT.

P.'S AT THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BOARD PER PER PERSON PRECISELY THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR HOWEVER IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS HAVE SET OUT ANTI UNION COMMUNICATIONS REPEATEDLY TO EXISTING BARGAINING UNITS FOR WORKERS ATTEMPTING TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN AN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION SIX. THE SHOOTING PER TO GRANTED UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE PER CAN ONLY ISSUE A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER REQUIRING THE EMPLOYER TO POST NOTICE OF A VIOLATION. SADLY BY THIS POINT THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. IT IS CLEAR THAT SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE STILL WILLING TO BREAK THE LAW AND WILL CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THEIR EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. THE LEGISLATURE ACTS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES SB NINE THIRTY ONE WOULD IMPOSE A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY PER VIOLATION PER AFFECTED EMPLOYEE NOT TO EXCEED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

THIRTEEN ELEVEN ALSO MY CENTER EGGMAN. SO THE SURVEY EGGMAN. I'M SO GLAD TO GET TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING AT THIS POINT SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH WOULD PUT SOME POWER BACK INTO THE HANDS. OF A PROTEST PROTESTS PERSPECTIVE TENET RECEIVING RENT SUBSIDIES BY ALLOWING THEM TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT ON THE BASIS OF DOCUMENTATION THEY CHOOSE INSTEAD OF JUST RELYING ON THEIR CREDIT SCORE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS- SO AND I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT REAL LIFE I HEARD FROM. SOME BUT SOCIAL WORKERS AT YOU KNOW THEY GET THEY WORK REALLY HARD AND WE ALL KNOW HOMELESSNESS IS A HUGE ISSUE WORK REALLY HARD TO GET SOMEBODY A VOUCHER AND THEN THEY CAN'T FIND THEM IRAN WE ALL KNOW THERE'S A- HUGE SCARCITY UP BUT IN ADDITIONALLY THEY LOOK AT THEIR CREDIT SCORE AND THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD CREDIT. WELL IT I THOUGHT THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT WE DON'T SEVENTIES HOMELESS THEY'VE BEEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE GOOD CREDIT OR ANY CREDIT BUT INDEED THAT IS WE REACHED OUT TO SOME HOUSING ADVOCATES AND THAT IS IN FACT TRUE- WHICH WOULD MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU- SO. AND WE WILL KNOW WE SELL A LOT MORE WORK TO DO TO GET PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES SO THIS IS A ANOTHER WAY TO BE ABLE TO REALLY PROVIDE A PATH FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BAD CREDIT BUT NOW HAVE ABOUT YOUR AND NEED A PLACE TO LIVE- RESEARCH AYE MAJOR UNIVERSITY SUPPORT THESE CLAIMS STUDIES FROM THE BAD CREDIT IS A NUMBER ONE REASON WHY. THE TONIGHT SHOW. WHICH IS AMAZING TO ME- SO. RIGHT NOW PROPERTY OWNERS FEEL LIKE IT'S THE BEST TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK HOWEVER POUCH HOUSING VOUCHERS PAY UP THE SENATE ONLY TO PAY 30% AND THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TENANT DOESN'T GO THE TENET THEN TO GIVE THE LAN OR- DIRECTLY TO THE MAN. TENET SO THAT MEANS WERE ALREADY REALLY REDUCING THE RISK OF NON PAYMENTS- SO A PERSON'S CREDIT SCORE WOULD NOT BE REFLECTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO IT NOW THEY HAVE A VOUCHER THEY HAVE INCOME COMING IN- TO BE ABLE TO BE. DEPENDABLE SO THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO AN ADDITIONAL TO THAT TO THE CREDIT SCORE BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO USE DOCUMENTATION THAT SAYS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. AND THEN HAVE ONE MORE TOOL FOR THE LANDLORD TO BE ABLE TO USE AS THEIR- BEGINNING TO EVALUATE IT FOR WHO WHO IS GOING TO- TO BE RENTING THERE THEIR- THEIR- THEIR ROOM HER THEIR APARTMENT- WE FEEL LIKE SB THREE THIRTY FIVE PROVIDES MORE ACCURATE TO FOR PROPERTY OWNERS TO VALUATE ATTENDANCE ABILITY TO PAY BY ALLOWING TENANTS TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION. PROVING THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR PORTION OF THE RENT. AND TODAY I HAVE WITH ME P. BAGS DALE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY.

AND HOW TO ACTUALLY. YOURSELF IN THIS ENDLESS LOOP WITH CREDIT HISTORY WHERE YOU'RE- YOU'RE- YOU'RE LIVING ON THE STREETS A WITH NO HISTORY AT ALL PAYING THINGS BACK AND THEN IF THAT'S BEING. PART IS A- PRECONDITION OF YOUR ABILITY TO. HAVE INCOME TO SUPPORT YOUR HOUSING VOUCHER- YOUR INDIFFERENCE CIRCULAR LOGIC IN BACK ON THE STREET AGAIN SO I THINK IT'S A TIMELY MEASURE DOESN'T SOLVE THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF THE LACK OF VOUCHERS AND SOME OF THE BIGGER THINGS BUT- CRITICAL MEASURE SELF. THANKS FOR PAYING FOR. THANK YOU SIR WHAT KELSEY. I NOTED THAT. THE AUTHOR. DIDN'T ASK FOR ANYBODY'S INPUT ON HOW TO REPAIR ONES CREDIT REPORT AND THAT NOBODY WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CREDIT REPORT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT LOOK IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AMENDMENTS HE SAID. GENERALLY LANDLORDS NEVER REPORT THE PEOPLE DO A GOOD JOB PAYING THE RENT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS- ABSENT. IF THEY IF THEY MISTER RENT ARE. YOU COMPLETED YOUR ONE YOUR FRIEND AFFIRMATIVELY DID IT AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.

THANK YOU NOW WE'LL GET TO THE REPAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND CHEER FOR THE CONTINUE TO IMPORT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE WORKED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS AND ED AND THE CENTRE A BUG AND I ALSO SPENT A LOT OF TIME. TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL TOGETHER. AND WHAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT TO REPAIR EVEN HEARD ME TALK ABOUT FOR MAYBE THE LAST FIVE YEARS I'VE HAD RIGHT TO REPAIR BILLS- I DON'T WANT TO I WANT IT FOR GRANTED THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY FOR ME WHAT WILL TALKING ABOUT- AND SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A RIGHT TO REPAIR I DON'T TALK ABOUT. THESE TALK ABOUT MY PAD I'M TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT CONTROLS OUR LIFE NOW WITH THE YOUR DISHWASHER YOUR WASHER MACHINE WE ARE BOUND TO BUY ELECTRONIC DEVICES- AND PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU ALREADY CAN FIX ALL YOUR DEVICES REYES GOING YOU TOO CAN YOU WATCH IT THERE WELL. THERE ARE THINGS AND YOU TO AN AMAZON THAT JUST DON'T HELP US FIX OUR DEVICES AND THOSE ARE FOUR COMPONENTS THAT ARE PART OF THIS BILL ONE AN AUTHENTIC PART PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER. TO THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS NEEDED TO MAKE THAT REPAIR TO MAKE IT MORE SAFE. THREE I'M- TALKING. NOT WALK THROUGH THE- STEPS. IN FOR THE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RESET. AND KEPT RECALIBRATE THE PRODUCT. AFTER IT IS REPAIRED. AND AGAIN THIS BE ABLE TO SYNC AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE'RE NOT. NOT CAN I GET INTO THE PRIVACY ISSUES. LIMITING ACCESS TO THESE THINGS MAKES DANGEROUS MAKES REPAIR LESS ACCESSIBLE. MORE COSTLY. AND POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE DANGEROUS. THIS BILL WILL MAKE THE PARTS TOOLS DOCUMENTATION AND SOFTWARE NEEDED FOR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCE REPAIR. ACCESSIBLE TO INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOPS. AND TO CONSUMERS. I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU AT THE BACKBONE OF A LOT OF OUR ECONOMIES THE SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES THAT SET UP SHOP TO BE ABLE TO FIX OUR THINGS BUT A LARGE LOT OF OUR LARGER- MANUFACTURERS HAVE MADE A BUSINESS MODEL ON KEEPING THE FIXING TO THEM AND OR- SELLING YOU A NEW ONE- THE CALIFORNIA WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF THIS IS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT MOST CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS MUST MAKE. REPLACEMENT PARTS AND TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR EITHER THREE OR SEVEN YEARS- AND A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE ARE AGAIN LARGER MANUFACTURERS ACCOMPLISH THIS THROUGH AUTHORIZING THEIR OWN. FIRST PARTY AN AUTHORIZED REPAIR NETWORKS TO MAKE SAID- REPAIRS LIKE LIKE IF YOU GO DOWN TO- IF YOU GO TO THE BIG TICKET COUNTER RIGHT THOSE ARE THE APPLE FOLKS WERE THEN. MOSTLY GOING TO SEND IT. BACK WHERE WHERE WHERE IT'S COME FROM- WE BECOME MORE DEPENDENT UPON OUR TECHNOLOGY IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AND EVEN SIMPLE APPLIANCES HAVE BECOME. INTERNET CONNECTED INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND W'VE CONCEDED A LOT OF OUR OWNERSHIP RIGHTS- THAT I THINK WE USED TO CHERISH RIGHT THAT I BUY IT IS IT MINE OR DID I RENTED AND IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND I HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO ASK THEM PERMISSION TO FIX IT AND- GET ANOTHER ONE FROM THEM IT BECOMES THIS LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU MAY NOT NECESSARILY WANT- WE KNOW WHO THIS IS. GOOD POLICY. BECAUSE IT WILL EIGHT IT WILL SAVE CONSUMERS MONEY AS THEY REPAIR RATHER THAN REPLACE EXPENSIVE PROJECTS AS MUCH AS A FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IF THIS WERE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE GROWING ELECTRONIC WASTE CRISIS WERE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE. YOU KNOW HOW MANY PHONES CALIFORNIA SIR AWAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. FORTY SIX THOUSAND PHONES GO EVERY SINGLE DAY THINK ABOUT THAT IN OUR WASTE STREAM- AND HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU GOT A NEW PHONE WHEN YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY NEED ONE BUT- HE DIDN'T. DO IT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO GET IT FIXED. IT WILL INCREASE THE VIABILITY OF LOCAL REPAIR SHOPS IN OUR COMMUNITY RATHER THAN OVERSEAS FACTORIES THAT MAKE NEW PRODUCTS AND OR OUT OF STATE AUTHORIZED. REPAIRS WHO WHO WILL OPPOSE THIS BELT. AND IT WILL ALSO DISRUPT THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT HAS COME TO RELY MORE ON MORE ON SHORTER CYCLES. BEFORE PRODUCTS MUST BE REPLACED I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT WE ARE BECOMING A DISPOSABLE SOCIETY- WE WANT TO REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE. THIS IS ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE MOMENT HAS SWUNG ON THIS JUST ISSUE WITH MANY MANUFACTURERS BEGINNING TO WORK ON SELF REPAIR PROGRAMS. THE FTC PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FEEDBACK ON THIS BILL AND THE BIDEN MINISTRATION. INCLUDED LOOSENING OF REPAIR RESTRICTIONS IN AN ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS.

HAS BEEN MENTIONED WHAT TWENTY FOUR EIGHT THE FASTEST GROWING PART OF OUR MUNICIPAL WASTE STREAM CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS ALONE PRODUCE SOME ONE POINT ONE MILLION TONS OF E. WASTE EACH YEAR WHICH WHICH- TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. THIS NUMBER IS SO HIGH IN PART BECAUSE MANY FACTORS OF DEVICES RANGING FROM SMARTPHONES REFRIGERATORS RESTRICT ACCESS TO NECESSARY REPAIR MATERIALS AS A RESULT CONSUMERS ARE FORCED TO GO TO THE MANUFACTURER WHO CAN SECRETARY REPAIR PRICES SO HIGH THAT. MAKES SENSE TO JUST GET A NEW DEVICE. SB NINE EIGHTY THREE PER FIRST CONSUMER REPAIRED. IT WOULD HELP TO. OUR YOU A QUITE IN REDUCE THE NEED FOR OUR- MINING OCCURRED.

SEVERAL ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BEFORE WE BEGIN LET LET ME JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL CENTER EGGMAN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE CALL THE TIME IF YOU AND I HAVE SPENT ON THAT- I THINK THAT THE PARTIES HAVE SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS- THE- PUNCHES. PROTECTING IT'LL PROPERTY WITHOUT COMPLETELY- ABROGATING THE RIGHT OF A CONSUMER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE RELATIVELY SIMPLE REPAIRS AND THE AMENDMENTS ARE THIS COMMITTEES EFFORT TO TRY TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE WHETHER WE RENTED. PROPERLY OR NOT- I SUPPOSE IS IT PROGRESSES WE WILL SEE- BUT- IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THERE IS A RIGHT TO REPAIR AND THAT WE- APPS NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR THE DEFINING THAT RIGHT TO REPAIR SO WE DON'T INTENTION FRINGE UPON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY- HAVING SAID THAT LET'S TURN IT OVER TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THAT ARE COMING. AS A QUICK. I HAVE A QUESTION. SAVE I AGREE 1100% WITH MY CARE- THERE BUT WHAT FRUSTRATES ME THE MOST IS. HOW YOU BECOME A DISPOSABLE SOCIETY- AND I REMEMBER. THE DATE RIGHT WE GET TO AN AGING YOU START TALKING ABOUT WHEN I'M READING- THE- WHERE WHERE THE IMPLANTS IS WOULD LAST FOR TWENTY FIVE THIRTY YEARS AND- AND THEN YOU'D GET A REPAIR PERSON AND FIX IT AND HE WOULD ASK FOR THAT. SO I'M- THEY'VE TO RAMP TO THE TO THAT GIVEN AND I'M I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT- THAT THERE ARE SOME BASIC- REPAIRS IT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE DONE I HAD MY SISTER IN LAW JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ME ABOUT HER PHONE TAG THE- THE GLASS ON HER PHONE BREAKING SHE REPAIRED AND- THE RIGHT- AND- THE- SINCE IT'S A PUSH. PHONE IT DIDN'T WORKING LIKE SHOULD WHEN YOU PUSHED IT TOTALLY AND TO HER THAT THAT WOULDN'T YOU COULDN'T GET IT. BOB GET BASEMENT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE COMPANY THAT SHE BOUGHT IT FROM SO I AM I AGREE I THINK I THINK THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THE KEY IS THE WHOLE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED HERE TODAY WHICH IS- GETTING INTO THE THAT WHOLE AREA OF- OF THE DATA THAT IS- PARTICULAR TO THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY AND KEEPING IT- PROTECTED. DISAPPEAR BRO DAY HOPEFULLY I KNOW YOU QUIT THE OPPOSITION IF THEY FITS. ALL THE NEEDLE WE WILL SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE STORE THANK YOU SENATE OTHER QUITE IS AROUND. THANK YOU WELL I TOTALLY AGREE WITH TRY TO DO I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT. QUIT. SHE OF WITH THAT I GAVE. WHEN I NEEDED FOR TO A AUTHOR. REPAIR SHOP AND THEY ALWAYS ENDED UP BEING SMALL SMALL REPAIR SHOPS WITH THEIR AUTHORIZES I FELT MORE CONFIDENT THAT THEY WERE GONNA HAVE THE TOOLS AND THEY WERE GOING TO USE THE RIGHT CARD SINCE THAT. A LESS OF A CHANCE ON IT- I STILL THINK WHAT YOU DOING I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU BUT IS THERE SUCH THING TO THAT END IN TERMS OF- HOW. YOU GIVE. IF THEY WILL HAVE- WE WILL NOT THEY WILL HAVE PRIORITY IF THEY'RE A SHOP THAT HAS THE CONNECTION OR THE AUTHORIZATION FROM FROM THE ORIGINAL COMPANY I DON'T KNOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A PLACE FOR ANY SHOP TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE REPAIRS BUT THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GIVES AN ADVANTAGE TO THOSE THAT ARE AUTHORIZED HAD JUST. TO THROWING THAT OUT. AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T GO TO WHOMEVER YOU WANT YOU CAN STILL GO TO THE TO THE AUTHORIZED DEALER YOU CAN STILL GO TO. THE BACK TO THE COMPANY YOU CAN STILL DO ALL THOSE THINGS THIS IS JUST SAYING THAT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT MOM AND POP SHOP IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN THE HOME BOYS. THAT THEY WOULD ALL. MOST TWO PURCHASE A THE MANUALS DYSKINETIC TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT I MEAN IT'S- BUT YOU CAN STILL GO TO THE OTHERS. IS IT BECAUSE THAT WAS AT THE QUESTION. NOT REALLY WELL JUST TO BE CLEAR SAID I CAN ASSUME YOU'RE ACCEPTING A COMMITTEE YES I ANSWER SUGGESTED AND TO RESPOND TO THE SENATE ALSO QUESTION. IS IT IF YOU ARE NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER YOU'VE GOT TO DISCLOSE THAT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER MAY HAVE SOME ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE OF BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THAT THE IN AN AUTHORIZED DEALER MUST DISCLOSE THAT TO THE CONSUMER. SO THEY'RE AWARE THAT THAT THAT DEVICE OR PRODUCT IS BEING REPAIRED BY SOMEONE AUTHORIZED THAT THAT THAT MAY PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT IN THE MARKET SO. OTHER QUESTIONS SIMILAR BORDERS. I CAN WRESTLE WITH THIS WITH THIS ONE- MY WIFE BOUGHT ME A WATCH- IT WAS IT WAS A NICE WATCH- AND I JUST WANTED-TO GET A REPAIR THAT WAS A MISTAKE- AND- I GOT IT REPAIRED. AND THEN I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY'RE LIKE OOPS SORRY WARRANTY VOIDED BECAUSE YOU WENT TO. BUT THIS JURY PAYER WHATEVER IT WAS- I WAS LIKE WOW. THAT IS A PROBLEM- SO WE- HEY YOU GUYS HAVEN'T BEEN A PUBLIC JONES TO REPAIR SHOP YOU SHOULD. ANYWAY MY POINT IS ALL THIS IS- I THINK THERE'S A BIG DISCONNECT- WE HAVE COTTAGE INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED BASED ON EXCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MANUFACTURERS AND THERE'S BENEFITS TO THAT BUT THERE'S ALSO SUBSTANTIAL CONSUMER DRAW. AIR THE COMMENTS THAT- I THINK ONE OF YOUR TEST FIRES- ALLUDED TO IS THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT THERE'S NOT A DEARTH OF INFORMATION ABOUT DATA THEFT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT AND I CAN JUST SCRATCH MY HEAD ON ON ON THAT- PERHAPS SOME OF OUR REPLICATE- THROUGH PUBLIC DOMAIN SOURCES IN MANUFACTURE COMPETING YOU KNOW- PRODUCTS OVERSEAS SO. AT ANY CALL FOR THAT. FURTHER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RIVERS ENGINEER HAPPENS EVERYWHERE IN THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES IT TAKES TO PINPOINT WHERE THAT OCCURRED MIGHT PARTIALLY EXPLAIN WHY THERE MAY NOT BE A DEARTH BUT WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THESE COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS OR ALL OVER THE PLACE ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ORIGINATE FROM OR FROM OVERSEAS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD PRACTICE BUT IN TERMS OF AN NDA YOU BRING UP A SHIP IF YOU BRING A WATCH TO A SHOP OR SOME OTHER FORM OF TECHNOLOGY AND THEY'RE WORKING ON A PRODUCT THEY'RE NOT LICENSED DEALER BUT HAVE ACCESS THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION TO THOSE MANUALS IN THOSE MODELS SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT THAT IS PROPRIETARY- IN PROTECTED INFORMATION- IS THAT PART OF. HOW THIS IS PLAYING PLAYING OUT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. REDUCTION AN NDA FOR- FOR THE MANUALS. IN THE MODELING FOR THEM TO WORK ON AN IPHONE OR WATCH YES AND I WILL I WILL ASK MISTER- RALLIED TO ANSWER THAT MORE DETAIL. THAT IS THE ONE WHEN THE WHEN THE COMPANIES ARE AUTHORIZED SOMEBODY THEY ARE ARE THEY ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT YOU CAN DISCLOSE WHICH YOU CAN NOT WE WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT TO BE ANY DIFFERENT. MISTER RIGHT CARD. DROPPED TIMES. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS IN NO WAY TO. ENFORCE THAT MANUFACTURES TO TURN OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY- MORE TO TURN- YOU KNOW TREAT THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S WHY WE'VE INCLUDED LANGUAGE IN AND ACCESSIBLE TO COMMITTEE AMENDED MAKING SURE THAT- SOURCE CODE IS IT'S NOT. REQUIRED FOR MANUFACTURERS NINE TRADE SECRETS- ARE NOT PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED TO REPAIR- THE THING IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ACTUAL PROPERTY GET THE WAY OF PREPARE BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE HAPPEN VERY OFTEN- BUT- JUST TO ADDRESS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO REACH. AND THAT. PERSON YOU CAN. WHEN YEAH YOU CAN. BUY AN IPHONE- BY. THE PRODUCT WASHU WHATEVER MIGHT BE AND REVERSE ENGINEERING THAT WAY. THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THE REPAIRS. THAT- INHERENTLY IS PROVIDING KIND OF NEW INFORMATION OR- I THINK THAT PEOPLE CAN'T DO IT THEY WANTED TO GO AND TAKE A COMPUTER APART AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND MAKE A COMPETING- PRODUCTS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT AND THEN.

I OUR- FOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE EXTENSIVE WORK WITH MY STAFF ON THE SOME BILLS AS A PRIORITY FOR LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S A THE COMMITTED AGAIN TEMPTING THE THIS BILL IS. BY USE IN STABLE HOUSE INCREASED TAX PROVIDING SAFETY AND STABILITY AS THEY HEAL FROM TRAUMA WE KNOW THAT WITHOUT HOUSING VICTIMS PRESSURE JUST EAST OF RELATION TO AVOID CAUSING INSTABILITY FOR HOME FOR THEM OFTEN THERE. 97% OF THOSE WOMEN REPORT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH IMMEDIATE BECAUSE OF THEIR HOMELESS. WITHOUT FOR THE PROTECTIONS ARE HOUSING LAWS EFFECTIVELY PUSH PEOPLE INTO MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SHIP IN OF CHOOSING BETWEEN STAYING IN AN ABUSIVE. EARLY AT HOME. THIS PROTECTIONS FOR. MANY OBJECTION LAW TO EXPAND THE DOCKING A SURVIVOR CAN SUBMIT TO PROVE THEIR VICTIM OF DOMESTIC% VIOLENCE. CURRENT LAW UNJUSTLY REVOKED HOUSING PROTECTIONS IF A PERPETRATOR COMES ON TO THE PROPERTY WITHOUT THE TENANTS KNOWLEDGE OR IS ON THE PROPERTY TO TAKE CARE FAMILY AND RELATIONSHIP PUBLIC CONCERT AS TRIAL TO TASTE IN JUST. BILL WAS OUT FROM HAPPENING IT PROTECT EVERS OF A BROADER OF. DRIVER JUSTIN OTHER. HOUSE OR SURVIVE. THE BILL GIVE SURVIVE RECALL IF THE PROPERTY OWNER JUST FOLLOW EARLY TERM LAW BY TO WRITE OR DISK THEIR CONFIDENTIAL. AND IT PROVIDES FOR A PARTIAL VISION THAT REMOVES THE PERPETRATOR FOR ABUSE OR VIOLENCE BUT GIVES A SURVIVOR AND THEIR FAMILY RIGHT TO REMAIN IN THE HOME. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR BUT WAS BILLED AS TO. THE BILL DOES NOT MEAN PERPETRATORS CAN COME INTO A PROPERTY IN THREATEN HER PEOPLE WITHOUT FACING LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT HARDER FOR LANDLORDS TO EVICT PERPETRATORS AND IT DOES NOT MEAN PERPETRATORS CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS ON A PROPERTY WITHOUT FACING LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT. THAT MAKES LIFE EASIER FOR PERPETRATORS. IT DOES MEAN THAT A PERPETRATOR COMES ONTO THE PROPERTY WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THE SURVIVOR OR COMES ON TO THE PROPERTY TO TAKE CARE OF A RELATIONSHIP ARE FAMILIAR OBLIGATION. THAT THIS EVER EXPRESSED THE DO NOT HAVE TO LOSE HOUSING. THIS IS. A TEST. FOR THIS BILL OKAY. IN YOUR- TOURNEY OF HOUSING A- JUSTICE PRO AT THE FAMILY VITAL. THAT PROJECT AND NINE GOMEZ FROM BILLABLE SURVIVORS. ALL RIGHT. MISTER CAMPEON.

FAMILIES IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE SPELL.

CALIFORNIA LAW IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT TENANTS FROM BEING AFFECTED BECAUSE THEIR ABUSE BUT THE LAW IS INEFFECTIVE LAST YEAR'S GAS AND PROTECTION. YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A NEW HOUSING. A SENIOR ATTORNEY AT MY ORGANIZATION INTRODUCED ME TO THE EVICTION DEFENSE OF SURVIVOR BY CHARACTERIZING IT AS USELESS DEFENSE I WOULD LIKELY NEVER USE. HE EXPLAINED IT WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT DID NOT CAPTURE THE REALITIES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MAKING IT UNAVAILABLE TO MOST SURVIVORS. HE WAS RIGHT. TO PRACTICE AND ASKING HOUSING THIRTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES I'VE ONLY HEARD OF ONE CASE WHERE CALIFORNIA'S LOSS PREVENTED A SURVIVOR FROM BEING AFFECTED BECAUSE OF ABUSE. GIVEN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. THE LOSS IN EFFECTIVENESS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SB TEN SEVENTEEN MAKE MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS TO CURRENT LAW. IT PROTECTS SURVIVORS FROM BEING EVICTED BECAUSE AN ABUSER CAME ON THE PROPERTY AGAINST THEIR WILL. COMMONLY AND USER A SHOW UP AT A SURVIVOR'S HOME AGAINST THEIR WISHES TO THE SURVIVORS FEAR OF LOSING THEIR HOME TO EXERT POWER AND CONTROL OVER THE SURVIVOR. ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT PLANS LANDLORDS TO REMOVE AN ABUSIVE TENANT WITHOUT REMOVING THE TENANT WHO'S BEING ABUSED. WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME GIVES TENANTS SURVIVORS INCLUDE FURTHER BRUISERS- PROTECTION FROM EVICTION.

SO I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS THIS FORWARD ACT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE'S- REAL NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE- TO HELP. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- WHAT I DO THINK WE NEED TO AT LEAST THAT AT SOME POINT- CONSIDER AND I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR IT BUT- AT. THE ABBOTT DOING WORK IN THIS AREA- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT I'M SENSITIVE TO IS THAT WHEN THERE IS A DOMESTIC SITUATION IN AN APARTMENT- IT DOESN'T AFFECT JUST THE FAMILY THAT'S EXPERIENCING THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT'S THE NEIGHBORS AND- AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU. YOU CALL TO HAVE SOMEONE ARRESTED IT'S THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY AT NIGHT. AND THERE ARE FLASHING LIGHTS AND THERE'S POLICE OFFICERS AND BECAUSE THEY'RE SO VOLATILE THERE IT'S DANGEROUS MANY OF THE SITUATION USUALLY- THE BEST. SIX DEAD- I'M REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO WE WANT TO SURE THEM AS WELL SO SOMEONE IS REALLY CREATING A NUISANCE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY'RE SHOWING UP WITHOUT THE- THERE AUTHOR IS A- AT. THE OR WITH AUTHORIZATION OF THE VICTIMS- IT KIND OF ENDED FINANCES OF- PROTECTIVE ORDERS THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME SOME WAY TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO I SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT THE SAME THING OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE SKATING VIOLENCE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILY DOESN'T GET EVICTED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A- K. WHO'S OUT OF CONTROL RIGHT. BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S A GOOD BET. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT- IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF AVOID IT. TO ALLOW THE LANDLORD TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEN PROTECTS THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE NEIGHBORS THE CHAIR AND I HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT AS WELL THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE REALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WHICH IS WHAT THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION HAS. ON MORE TROLL WHO. AND WE'RE TO SPACE UNDERSTAND KIND OF HARD TO THE PROCESS SOMETIME IT. SO I AGREE AND WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THAT AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW WE- CONTINUE. THANK YOU. SEE THAT. SIR DRAWS OF- NO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS WELL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I. HAD A BILL. THAT HAD TO DO WITH. THEM NOT JUST DOMESTIC FLIGHTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT BROADER SCOPE OF VIOLENCE.

AND SO THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS GOING ON ON THE GROUND THAT. I THINK WE JUST. IT MAKE SIMPLIFY HIS. VERY COMPLICATED YEAH SO THAT BILL HAD TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO BREAK ON THE LEASE.

WHAT'S TO STOP SIMPLY IDENTIFIES IS PREGNANT FROM BOOKING A FREE ABORTION VACATION TO AUSTIN TO LOS ANGELES AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE WHO CONFIRMS THE PREGNANCY IN ANOTHER STATE AND WHAT IF YOUNG DESPERATE TEEN GIRS WHO COME HERE CHANGE THEIR MINDS LIKE I DID DO YOU THINK PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL SIMPLY ABSORB THE COST NO THEY WILL NOT.

ELEVEN FORTY TWO WILL BECOME A POWERFUL THREAT FORCING THESE NAIVE GIRLS TO CLOSE THEIR EYES AND GET THE PROCEDURE DONE BECAUSE IT WILL BE OVER SOON SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO WILL FIND A HUGE NATIONAL ABORTION WILL FUND A HUGE NATIONAL ABOARD. I THINK VOTE NO ON SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO. THANK YOU OF THE CIDER. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ALEXANDER SNYDER AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND THE CEO FOR THE LIFE LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION. SPF FORTY TWO IS NOT A PRO. SOLE PURPOSE IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE ABORTION THE STATED AIM OF SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO IS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A TRUE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FOR ABSOLUTE FREEDOM WHEN IT COMES TO REPRODUCTION TO REPRODUCE MEANS TO COPY A BY DEFINITION WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CREATION OF NEW PEOPLE. WHEN YOU ABOVE UP THEM BECAUSE YOU WERE HAVE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE BILL IS A LIE. SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO ESTABLISHES A PROPAGANDA CAL. IN ABOUT HOW TO GET A FREE ABORTION THE- ALTERNATIVES TO ABORTION. NOTHING ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS PRENATAL CARE OR ANYTHING ELSE A PREGNANT WOMAN MIGHT NEED OR WANT. THE INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE WILL BE CONTROLLED BY SO CALLED SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHICH ALL HAPPENED TO BE. IN WHICH ALL HAPPENED TO BE ENTITIES THAT A GREAT. PROMOTE ABORTION. THE WEBSITE IS GOING TO WOMEN ABOUT THE PHYSICAL LET ALONE THE WELL DOCUMENTED MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL COMPLICATIONS FROM ABORTION OR THE REALITY OF THAT IF THEY TAKE ABORTION PILLS THEY COULD END UP DELIVERING IS SMALL BUT FULLY FORMED PERSON. A VICTIM OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN THE- PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND OTHER SPONSORS OF SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO ALSO INCLUDED STATE FUNDED OUTREACH PROGRAM TO TELL THE PUBLIC HOW AND WHERE. TO ACCESS ABORTION WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE MCDONALD'S SPONSORING A BILL. THERE'S TO PAY FOR ADVERTISING. I HAMBURGERS I MEAN WE BE A LITTLE SKEPTICAL RIGHT. SB ELEVEN FORTY TWO AUTHORIZES CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO MANAGE GRANT PROGRAM TO ENTICE OUT OF STATE WOMEN COME TO CALIFORNIA FOR FREE ABORTIONS. TO RELIVE THE LEAD. NOTED THAT HAS NO EXPIRY OR BEING TO ADMINISTER SAFER PROGRAMS BUT THE MORE EGREGIOUS OVERSIGHT IS APPOINTING A COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TWO MEN. GRAHAM SAID. OBLITERATING TEXT DOESN'T CONTAIN A SINGLE REFERENCE TO WOMEN.

IN THE FALL ACT AND DINNER HAVE TO PROVIDE SPENT NOTED ON THEIR CONTACT WITH THE DEBTOR OR VALIDATE- DEBTS UPON REQUEST. THIS IS A BILL IS SIMPLE AND IT'S URGENT THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE COLLECTION OF RENT DEBT IS COVERED BY THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS OTHER KINDS OF CONSUMER DEBT. UNDER THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT SPECIFICALLY IT DEFINES RENTAL DEBT AS ON PAY IT TENANT UNDER TENANCY IT EXTENDS THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ROSENTHAL ACT TO COVER RENTAL DEBT THAT BECAME PAST DUE ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. NINETEEN THIRD IT EXEMPTS ANYONE COLLECTING RENTAL DEBT FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO LIST A DEBT COLLECTOR LICENSE NUMBER WHEN COLLECTING RENT. AND THIS BILL FINALLY A CONSUMER CREDIT TRANSACTION DOES NOT MEAN A TRANSACTION THAT RESULTS AND RENTAL DEBT THIS MEANS THAT THE LANDLORDS DO NOT NEED TO OBTAIN A DE COLLECTOR LIGHT WINDS IN.

I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT HARASSED WHEN THEY COLLECT ASKED TO RATE. BUT WE ARE. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WILL BE ACCEPTED TODAY. WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT WE STILL OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE FORM. OF SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR. AND DINNER ASSIST AS AN EXCELLENT JOB OF MAKING CLEAR THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES WE STILL HAVE TWO REASONS POSES. FIRST OF BY PLAINLY STATE. PURPOSES TO GOVERN THE BANKING AND CREDIT SYSTEM BRENT IS DISTINCT FROM ANY OTHER DEBT THAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO LUMP IT WITH ANOTHER CREDIT CARD RENT IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. IN OTHER WORDS RENT. CREDIT UNLIKE MORTGAGE THERE IS NO SECURITY INTERESTS THAT SECURES OUR RENTAL DEBT SB THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR WOULD IGNORE IGNORE THIS REALITY ANY QUITE RENT AS THE- IT WILL BE. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR STILL THE CONFLICT WITH EXISTING CALIFORNIA LANDLORD TENANT LAW FOR EXAMPLE THE ROSENTHAL ACT WOULD PROHIBIT LANDLORDS. WE REGARDING SOURCE OF RENTAL DEBT ARE OFTEN FAMILY MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE A PARENTS BOARD ONS OR SOMETHING ABOUT SORT THEY DON'T HAVE. IT'S THE OTHER CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT A LANDLORD FROM SPEAKING TO THAT GUARANTOR PARENT IF THAT CHILD IS PAST DUE ON THE RENT UNLESS AND UNTIL. BUT TENS OF JUDGING. AGAINST THAT THAT TENANTS. THIS WOULD HARM THE GUARANTOR PARENTS AND THE TENANTS ALIKE AND SIMPLY DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE PURPORT ROSENTHAL ACT IF A PERSON HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT DEBT COLLECTION MUST IMMEDIATELY CEASE THIS IS A PROVISION EXPRESSLY MEANT TO APPLY TO TRADITIONAL CONSUMER DEBT NOT RENTALS AT. BUT AS APPLIED TO THE RENTAL CONTEXT ALANLAR WOULD PREVENT IT WOULD BE PREVENTED FROM COLLECTING RENTAL DEBT BECAUSE OF THIS PROVISION OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NONSENSICAL AND WAS NOT THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL. PRICE OF CODE SEC. UNFORTUNATELY THESE ISSUES AT THE BILL CREATES WITH CALIFORNIA'S LANDLORD TENANT LAW WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS. I WHAT THIS BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED IT REQUIRES FAR MORE NUANCE THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. OTHERS OPPOSITE.

BOB LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY CASKEY. THE SEVEN MILLS THIS IS A GOOD JOB ON- SAYING THAT THE STATUTE MAY BE CREATED WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE SAVING. GRACE PROVISION WOULD BE THAT IF THE CALPERS OR CAL STIRS- FINANCING GOOD FAITH THAT THE ACTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR- BOARD RESPONSIBILITY OVER THERE FINALLY FORD. I DIDN'T HEAR THAT IN THE OPPOSITION IS THERE IS THERE A DISAGREEMENT ON THAT. OR IS IT IS A DISAGREEMENT. ON THE RISKS TO THE FUN AND THE DIVERSIFICATION IS A- THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT KOWSKI I THINK- THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THAT TRUE- REASON FOR OPPOSING A BILL LIKE THIS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONE TOOL IN ADDITION TO ENGAGEMENT THAT COULD BE USED- TO PROVIDE MORE RETURNS- FOR. PARTICIPANTS IN FACT THE CALPERS HAS A DIVESTMENT REVIEW PRESENTATION I BELIEVE THAT WAS DONE NOT TOO LONG AGO I THINK BETTER ABOUT A YEAR AGO. ON PAGE SIX OF THAT EVEN STATES BASED ON THE FIVE OR SIX DIVESTMENT POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE BOARD LED LED BY CALPERS STIRS BOARDS AND THE OTHER HALF BY THE LEGISLATURE- THE- I QUOTE CAL. ST HOW DAVIS. MANAGES FUND THE ANY FEASIBLE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES WOULD YIELD A LOWER RATE OF RETURN WITH COMMENSURATE DEGREES OF RISK FOR CREATE A HIGHER DEGREE. OF RISK WITH COMMENSURATE. RATES OF RETURN. AND THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THEM. WAS A GUY'S NAME SEPARATELY THE FIRST THE FIRST WITNESS CENTER AT SAM'S TO YOLO WITH USED TO THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS HE AT LEAST IT INDICATES THAT THAT NEW YORK CITY COULD MEET ITS FINANCIAL TARGETS BY DIVESTING- AND I JUST I DON'T KNOW. IT APPEARS THE PORTFOLIO THEY CALPERS HAS IS ABOUT 1% OF FOSSIL FUELS GIVE OR TAKE WHATEVER YOU KNOW WHATEVER THEY DO ON A DIFFERENT DAY I'D I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PORTFOLIO OF REASON I ASK IS THAT IS THAT THERE IS SOME RISK WHEN YOU DO SOME OF THE BEST DIVESTITURE THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER GOOGLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S MAKING MONEY RIGHT- OKAY BUT. I'D SAY THE GUY FIFTH WHETHER WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY THE WISDOM OF IT I GUESS IS THE THIS IS THE QUESTION- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT HOW HOW WE GET THERE. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS SIR SIR WIENER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR LEADING ON IT I KNOW IT HAS BEEN EASY. IN A LOT OF- BLOWBACK- I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS OF THIS BILL- AND- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND- THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CALPERS- TO BE A- FIDUCIARY- I JUST DON'T SEE FOSSIL FUEL DIVESTMENT. ANYWAY HARMING- THE- THE PENSION FUND I JUST DON'T I JUST DON'T SEE IT IT'S A IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE. IT'S ONE. INDUSTRY AMONG SO MANY- IT IS WE'RE NOT ASKING THIRD BEST FROM LIKE FORTY PERCENT. OF THE FUNDS THIS IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE- AND THIS IS HONESTLY AN INDUSTRY THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE INVESTING AND WE SHOULD NOT BE A PARTY TO PROVIDING CAPITAL. TO AN INDUSTRY THAT IS LITERALLY BURNING AND FLOODING THE PLANET THAT'S MAKING PEOPLE SICK. THAT IS DESTROYING PEOPLE'S HOMES. THAT IS FLOODING ROADS AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS- AND IT SAYS WE SHOULDN'T BE A PARTY- SO THAT AND SO I THINK THIS MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD WE ALSO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHEN CALIFORNIA TAXES AND A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE AROUND THE WORLD AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAVE WE SHOULD NOT BE INVESTING IN FOSSIL FUELS- SO I. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR WIENER- DID YOU MAKE MOTION SIR WINNER MOST BOOK ASSEMBLY CASKEY OF QUESTION I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION LOOK AT MY NOTES AND- IT IS THEY HOURS LATE. I THOUGHT I HEARD THE OPPOSITION SAY THAT THE BY. HOLDING ON THE PORTFOLIOS THEY HAD- OPPORTUNITIES FROM INSIDE IS A SHAREHOLDER TO AFFECT THE PUBLIC POLICY OF SOME OF THESE CORPORATIONS TO MOVE THEM. TO A CLIMATE OR A CARBON FREE- THE SITUATION OR REDUCTION. I WAS GONNA ASK IS TO ADDRESS THE PERSON WHO SPOKE HOW DO YOU DO THAT. AND HAS THAT BEEN THAT HAS THAT BEEN EFFECTIVE. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW THAT THAT DOES SEEM LIKE WE CAN DO IT ON OUR OWN AND I DIDN'T. WANT TO GET SOME SENSE OF. HOW THE SENATE CHIEF. SERVICE CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS CENTER I DID NOTE- THAT CALPERS- APPROACH HAS BEEN ONE OF ENGAGEMENT THROUGH- DIFFERENT STRATEGIES LIKE THEIR THEIR PARTICIPATION CO FOUNDING OF THE CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED PLUS WHICH HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH CLIMATE GOVERNANCE- TO DRIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN DR OTHER RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE- CALPERS ACTUALLY DOES. DO SOME REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED FROM US SENATE BILL FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN S. B. NINE SIX FOR THE TALKS ABOUT HOW- CALPERS IS ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISK ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO THEY DO TALK ABOUT- ENGAGEMENT IN- SHARE OWNER PROPOSALS- BEFORE THE COMPANY- PROXY DISCUSSIONS BOARD MEMBERS AND THOSE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. I BELIEVE THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM- ALLEN'S ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE IN THEIR PUBLIC MATERIALS ABOUT HOW THEY ENGAGE- YOU KNOW ENTITIES ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES INCLUDING RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT WITH THAT CALIFORNIA GOALS OF BEING CARBON FREE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS BY 40% BY TWENTY THIRTY GREAT QUESTION. THIS IS SET THAT'S INCORPORATING CALPERS MCALISTER'S. YEAH I MEAN I GOVERNOR LEASE YEAH I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT THEY DO ASSESS THIS REPORT FROM- DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AND THEY HAVE TO UPDATE EVERY THREE YEARS THEY DO TALK ABOUT THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH THE PARIS ACCORD AND OTHER PROPOSALS WITHIN- THEIR MENTAL PUT FORTH BY THIS. THE STATE. INCENT YES IN THE CENTER AYE KASKI AS THEY HAVE NET ZERO BOTH CALPERS AND STIRS NET ZERO BY TWENTY FIFTY WHICH IS JUST A PLEDGE. AT THIS TIME- KNOWING THAT IT DOESN'T ALIGN WITH CALIFORNIA GOALS. AND WHEN YOU GO TO K. CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU CAN GO ON CLIMATE ACTION ONE HUNDRED DOT ORG. AND SEE YOU CAN TYPE IN ANY OF THE TWO HUNDRED LISTS THAT WE- CHEVRON. CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR- GOALS BY EVEN TWENTY FIFTY. IN TERM GOALS NOT EVEN HITTING THAT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE- OUR OWN GOALS AS A AS A PORTFOLIO OF NINE BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE TWO BOARDS. IF THE FOLKS THAT WERE INVESTING IN AREN'T EVEN DOING THAT. SO IT JUST BEGS THE QUESTION ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO- INSURE THAT THE PORTFOLIO DOESN'T UNDER PERFORMING THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. WHEN WE GET OUT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION OF WAR WHEN PRICES GO DOWN AND WHEN WE HAVE POTENTIALLY STRANDED ASSETS WHICH IS. NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE. CENTER STERN. THANK YOU- I WOULDN'T JUST- THANK THE AUTHOR- OR THE JOINT AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD AND FOR ALL THE ADVOCATES SHOWING UP HERE- THE HISTORY OF DIVESTMENT- IN THE CLIMATE ARENA IS THIS IS NOT NEW GROUND THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WAITING INTO I DON'T THINK THIS IS- UNTESTED WATERS THE DATA I'VE GOT HERE MY STAFF FOR. SHOWS THAT ABOUT THIRTY NINE TRILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS ACROSS FIFTEEN HUNDRED INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE WORLD ARE CURRENTLY DIVESTING SO IT I KNOW YOU MENTIONED SECONDS ALL IS THE NINE BILLION. IN A JOINT THE JOINT HOLDINGS OF. OF SOME OF OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS BUT- WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE JOINING THIRTY NINE TRILLION DOLLARS IN OTHER ASSETS IT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A RISKY MOVE I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND- AND THE PEOPLE WHO FRANKLY DEFENDER. FROM CLIMATE CHANGE FROM WILDFIRES BURN MY HOUSE DOWN AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE'S. WITH THAT TREPIDATION AND SORT OF BUYING THE LINE FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY THAT SOMEHOW IF YOU START TO. ABANDON THIS ADDICTION TO OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO PUT OURSELVES AT RISK. IN FACT I THINK QUITE THE OPPOSITE I THINK. THAT CLIMATE THAT CLIMATE COMMITMENT IS GOING TO KEEP OUR WORKING MEN AND WOMEN SAY FOR- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PORTFOLIO'S PERFORMANCE- ANY OF THOSE THIRTY NINE TRILLION AYE AYE AYE YOU CAN YOU CAN ANALYZE THE DIFFERENT PENSION FUNDS GOVERNMENT MY OWN ALMA MATER HARVARD FINALLY AFTER A DECADE OF ADVOCACY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LARGEST PRIVATE HOLDING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD BE ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THE LOCKS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. CAN DIE DIVESTMENT AND- THE SERRANO CONFLICT WITH THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES OR WITH ANY COMMITMENT TO RETURN SERIES SAVINGS TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND IN FACT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT- THIS LEGISLATION WILL DE RISK OUR PORTFOLIO AND NOT LEAVE US EXPOSED TO THE NEXT TIME A GLOBAL PETRO DICTATOR WANTS TO. ELECT TO GO TO WAR WITH THEIR NEIGHBOR- TO HAVE OUR LIABILITIES THAT EXPOSED TO THE GLOBAL VOLATILITIES OF OPEC IN THE LARGER OF FOSSIL FUEL DICTATORSHIPS THAT THEY CURRENTLY HOLD ALL CONSUMERS AND OUR WORKERS OVER A BARREL SEEMS TO ME MISGUIDED. I APPRECIATE. THE TREPIDATION BUT WHAT I'M HOPING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION AND ESPECIALLY- YOU KNOW THROUGH THE- INCREASE LIQUIDATION PERIOD THAT YOU PUT FORTH ANY AMENDMENTS HERE WHICH I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT AND DOES GIVE US SOME TIME AND- HOPEFULLY ALIGNS WITH WHAT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS ARE DOING OPERATIONALLY NOW- IS TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. AND CLIMATE COMMITMENTS OR FIND. IN SIGNING PLEDGES FIND- BUT MONEY TALKS AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE- WE PUT THAT THAT MONEY TO WORK FOR THE FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SO. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED ON. TO THE MEASURE AND- WHO LOOK FOR JUST THAT. THANK YOU CENTER CERTAIN OTHER CENTERS ARE ALSO. YES I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY- I HOPE. THAT THE WAY WE FEEL THE URGENCY. TO MOVE AND SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MOVE IT FORWARD THE WILL FLOW HAVE THE SAME URGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO. THE JOBS THAT WE'RE LOSING BECAUSE WE WILL BE LOSING JOBS- THAT WE HAVE THE SAME URGENCY. AND THE SAME BOLDNESS. TO CREATE THE NEW JOBS IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE WELL PAID WELL PAID WITH RETIREMENT WITH THE KINDS OF BENEFITS THAT WE ALL SAY AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS LET'S PUT IT. YEAH LET'S PUT LET'S THROW DOWN IN THE SAME WAY GOING TO BE REPLACING IT WITH FROM THE GREEN ECONOMY LET'S SHOW THE SAME BOLDNESS AND THE SAME- A COMMITMENT. THAT WE ARE TODAY ON THE ON THIS END OF IT BECAUSE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER DOESN'T WORK ALSO- AND LET'S MAKE SURE WE ALL HAVE THAT SAME COMMITMENT AND HOLD OURSELVES TO THE- MISTER MISTER CHAN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT EARLIER THIS THE IS NOT LIMITED TO JUST SAID TOTALLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS AND GONNA. BE HAPPY TO PARTNER ON THAT. IS ONE PERSON I THINK THAT WAS HERE WHEN HE WON THIS WENT THROUGH THE LABOR COMMITTEE FOR ACTUALLY CENTERED RUSSELL WAS TOO. AND I THINK I'D LIKE SO I JUST LIKE TO STIPULATE MY ENTIRE LONG SPEECH FROM THAT COMMITTEE. HERE AGAIN WITH THOSE TWO YET YEAH BECAUSE HE BRIEFLY IT WAS HARVARD AND UC OF DONE IT WITHOUT NEGATIVE- IMPACT THERE WAS CONCERN. ABOUT INFANTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN LABOR ABOUT AN ACT OF GOD AND AS THINGS ABOUT- DIVESTMENT AND YET THERE WERE FIVE YEARS AND NOW OUT OF THIS THESE AMENDMENTS THURSDAY EIGHT YEARS. ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS WERE MADE ABOUT LOSS AT THE TIME OF DIVESTMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THEY WERE NOT TRUE AND THERE'S JUST AS AN URGENCY TO DO THIS SO I WILL BE AGAINST SPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. NUMBER THANK YOU. SIR HERTZBERG YEAH I JUST WANT TO FOCUS THIS DISCUSSION AS I THINK ABOUT THIS- IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA BOND LAWYER AND BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS A LOT LOOK THE IDEA ABOUT THE RATE OF RETURN AND COSTS IS INTERESTING. BUT WHEN WE MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS THERE FOR MAKING A STATEMENT ABOUT WHERE WE WANT TO GO. THE ISSUE HERE IS CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DEAD IN THIRTEEN SECONDS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TAKING AND URGENT ACTION. THAT URGENCY HAS INFORMED LIKE JUST SANRIKU WOULD YOU THEIR. SO SAYS TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED HIGH WAGE JOBS RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION AS FAST AS WE CAN. WE'VE GOTTA BE MAKING DECISIONS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL WITH INVESTMENT BILL THAT MAXINE WATERS TWO YEARS AGO IN SOUTH AFRICA THOSE WERE MORAL STATEMENTS THIS IS A STATEMENT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE. NOT ABOUT FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE ISIS IF YOU REVIEW THE PORTFOLIO OF OUR VARIOUS INVESTMENTS IS A LOT OF THAT WE COULD ANALYZE WITH THE BEST MINDS OUT THERE THAT PROBABLY AREN'T PERFORMING AS WELL RIGHT THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET READ OF. THIS IS A STATEMENT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THE STATEMENT OUR CLIENT THAT CHANGE TO ME THE IT HAS TO. DO WITH A SET OF POLICIES THAT IS INFORMED BY URGENCY I HAVE OPPOSED A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT CHANGING DATES AND TIMES AND- DID MARK DEADLINES AND STUFF VERSUS SAYING. LET'S GO DO THAT PLAN IN THE PORT FOR THE HYDROGEN FOR YOUR AREA IN LONG BEACH LET'S GO DO THE PROJECT DWN IN IN FOR BATTERIES SO WE'RE NOT RELYING ON CHILLY IN OTHER PARTSOF THE COUNTRY. KADING THOSE JOBS HERE LET'S TAKE YOU KNOW SOLAR CELLS THE SOLAR FIELDS IN MY HOBBY AND LET'S PUT ELECTROLYZER IS THEIR TURN REAL JOBS BECAUSE A PROBLEM SOLVER IF YOU JUST. HAVE TO GET DIRECTOR SET UP IF. IT'S PLAINEST REAL JOBS THE HE BECOMES A BIG PICTURE THINK ABOUT HOW CREATE WE JOBS. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS SO LOOK. MY FRIEND IN THE CAR SHE'S BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR YEARS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THE ONE ON THE BOARD OF CUTBACKS ON. HE ORCHESTRATED A PRETTY BRILLIANT MOVE. PRETTY BRILLIANT WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR PEOPLE ARE INVESTMENTS TO DO THAT. SO THIS I AM PERSUADED TO SOME EXTENT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THAT OKAY WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE ENTITIES THAT ARE GOING TO POLLUTE THE EARTH IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE DRAW THESE RIDICULOUS LINES IN THE AIR THAT WE CALL STATES AND CITIES AND COUNTIES WE ARE ONE GIGANTIC GLOBE. THE STUFF IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS IN THE HARBOR IS KILLING US THAT POLLUTANTS IN THE HARBOR THAT STUFF'S COMING FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. SO IT BECOMES AYE AYE ALL OVER SAY IS THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO ADDRESS THE LARGER ISSUE. APOLOGIZE I'M TAKING MR LAYERED SPEECH BECAUSE I WORK ON LABOR. BUT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE THIS THING UP BECAUSE THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE THE PROJECT INTO THIS. ARE PROJECTING BECAUSE TO THE POINT THAT SENATOR ALSO MADE. I CAN WITH A MAN. REPLACE IT WITH REAL WORK HAPPENING GUEST STARS YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO WHAT WHAT'S THE TERM. THAT WE USE- THE- INTERESTS. CHARM WHAT DO NOT TO. ARE GIVEN REAL AND WE'RE FIGURE OUT. HOW TO CREATE AND- APPROACH TO THIS LOOK. I'M OF A LARGE BIRD ON THIS BECAUSE- THE TEST IS. ARE WE REDUCING GHGS ENVIRONMENT I USED TO TELL THE ENVIRONMENT WAS TO SIT BACK AND TALK ABOUT THIS ALL DAY LONG. ALL THE REGULATIONS HOW MANY POUNDS OF CARBON YOU REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENT I TOOK OFF TWELVE YEARS OF MY LIFE. AND I TRAVEL THE WORLD TO REDUCE CARBON IN THE WORLD RIGHT. DOES THIS IN FACT DO THAT OR DOES IT JUST MAKE A STATEMENT THAT'S THE QUESTION SO LOOK AT YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT. TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO KEEP. GO IT'S GOT SIGNIFICANT. DISCUSSION POINTS THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN. AND THIS IS THE FIRST THE SECOND COMMITTEE BUT THE FIRST HOUSE THAT NEEDS SOME HOMEWORK ON THIS STUFF. IS STILL NEEDS SOME HOMEWORK I THINK IS I THINK THAT THE CHAIR. AT THE DATES BUT- I DO THINK WE CAN ANALYZE THIS LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT I THINK YOUR EARNEST. AND YOUR CARD. YOU TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND I GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT. BUT BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEEPER THINK. ABOUT OUR LARGE ARCHITECTURE WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING. TO ACTUALLY REDUCE GHGS LET ALONE ALL THE NEAR TERM IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE. OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE BUT MISFORTUNE- IT WITH THE AT CABBIE OUT THAT I HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENSURE THAT GOING FORWARD BUT- I WHAT I REALLY WANT TO THINK IT THROUGH. REGULAR REGARD FOR YOUR APPROACH THIS AGAIN I REGARD YOU THINK AND- AND PEOPLE. ARE REALLY UPSET BECAUSE THE WORLD'S COMING TO AN END SO TO SPEAK. AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT AND DILIGENT AND EARNEST AND FAST. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IN THE WAY. THAT WE PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS SO. THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF THE DEEP THINK THAT I'VE ENGAGED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HERTZBERG. OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS- ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN CLOSE. THANK YOU MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE DEBATE AND THAT THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I KNOW THIS ISN'T AN EASY- TASK TO ASK BUT I THINK THAT IT'S- YOU KNOW I AM LITERALLY PUTTING MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS ON THE CALPERS MEMBER. MYSELF CITY OF LONG BEACH. I'M ALSO- A FOUR OH ONE K. A PRIVILEGE TO HAVE A FOUR ONE K. FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST ESG MOST SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE CORPORATIONS- WHEN I WAS THERE FOR SIX YEARS I ACTUALLY. WAS ACTIVELY LOOKING AT VETTING COMPANIES NOT JUST FOR FOSSIL FUEL. DIVESTMENT BUT ALSO FOR ENSURING THAT THEY WERE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THAT THEY ACTUALLY- DIDN'T VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT THEY ALSO HAD GOOD GOVERNMENT SO. I'M LITERALLY PUTTING MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS HERE IN ADDITION TO SO MANY MEMBERS THAT HAVE SAID THAT THEY WANT THIS DIVESTMENT TO HAPPEN- WHAT I WILL JUST END WITH SAYING IS WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME IS DIVESTMENT AS HAPPENED IN FACT HOLSTERS MADE A STATEMENT. I'M NOT TOO LONG AGO WITH PRIVATE PENSIONS I'M SORRY PRIVATE PRISONS- THE BASICALLY DIVESTED WITHIN SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE ENGAGE THEY WENT ON SITE AND VISITED PRIVATE PRISONS A NOTICE AT THAT FAMILIES IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE BEING SEPARATED. FROM EACH OTHER SO WITH THAT THEY CAN MAKE STATEMENTS WERE HERE TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO AND THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DIVESTING AND DOING. RIGHT BY- SCHURING THAT THERE'S GOOD JOB IN THAT WERE. IN THOSE CLEAN JOBS. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. THANK YOU CENTER GONZALEZ WAS THERE MOTION. IS CENTER WE ARE MOVING THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT.

SEVEN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK- IS A STAFF REPORT- BRILLIANTLY POINTS OUT IN THIS ONE AND A HALF PAGE BILL THAT- THE JUDICIARY'S JURISDICTION IS OVER THE CIVIL PENALTIES THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THE FIRST OFFENSE SECOND OFFENSE AND THIRD OFFENSE BEING THE FIVE HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND- LEVELS CITY ATTORNEYS IN GAS CITY COUNCIL. COUNTY COUNCILS WOULD DO THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE BAN AT OF THE BILL THAT'S IN PRINT. AND THEY HAVE THE ABILITY IMPOSED A CIVIL PENALTY SINCE IT'S NEGATIVELY- IF- IMPACTS VIOLATIONS AND FALSE AND THAT THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTION SO THIS BILL SB TWELVE. FIFTY SIX MOVES AWAY FROM THE SINGLE. PRODUCTS THAT HARM THE ENVIRONMENT POSES A THREAT TO ITS THREAT TO SAFETY IN. OUT WORKERS IN ENDS UP IN LANDFILLS- THERE'VE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS YOU KNOW HI I WANT TO- NO TED I AM WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR I'D LIKE TO SEE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY WOULD RATHER THAN THE PAN SOME OF THE POINTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RACES THAT ARE WE JUST GONNA USE ONE PATENT A PATENT IS GOING TO AFFECT. ONE COMPANY AS WE SEE- TRANSITIONS TO A REFILLABLE SEN ACTUALLY THERE ARE MULTIPLE PAT HOUSTON THIS INDUSTRY PATENT FOR FLAME KING KING HOLDS ITS LOCATION. OF THE SAFETY RELIEF FELL ABOUT THEIR PATENT IS FOR THE SAFETY RELIEFVALVE TO BE LOCATED WITHIN THE STEM OR SERVICE- CONNECTION VALVE OF THE CYLINDER. WORTHINGTON HAS A SAFETY RELIEF VALVE LOCATED ON THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE STEM THIS IS THE EXISTING DESIGNED ONE MORE THAN TEN ACQUIRED THE PRODUCT- PRODUCTION FACILITY IN KANSAS FROM COLEMAN MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. AGO TO REFILL ASIF A SINGLE USE CYLINDER THE REFILL OUR MUST USE THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE TO ALLOW AIR TO. GAS FLOWING IN FLAME KING AT MANCHESTER REFILL POOLS ARE DESIGNED WITH THE BLEEDER VALVES TO THE CONSUMER DOESN'T NEED TO TOUCH. THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE THEREBY. NOT AFFECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE IMPORTANT SAFETY DESIGN FEATURE IN IN THIS WAY ANY CYLINDER MANUFACTURER CAN DESIGN WHERE THAT SAFETY RELIEF FELLAS LOCATED ON THEIR CYLINDERS. SINCE THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE DESIGN TO REFILLABLE CYLINDERS TO ACCOMMODATE THE SAFETY RELEASE VALVE THERE IS. NO LIMIT ON HOW MANY CAN BE DESIGNED AND THEREFORE PATENTED WE UNDERSTAND THAT WORTHINGTON ALREADY INSTALL SEEK TO RELEASE VALVE CORES FROM DIFFERENT SEVERAL DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS INTO THE WORTHINGTON CYLINDERS DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. SO AGAIN IT IS POSSIBLE HAVE MULTIPLE ENTITIES- WITH PATENTS ON VALVES- THE SPONSORS WHO. HAVE STATED THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT AND IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BENEFIT ONE COMPANY. OR ONE COMPANY CENTRIST AND WE WANT TO TRANSITION TO MORE. REUSABLE SHOULDERS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY STRINGS AND WHEN CALIFORNIA BENEFITS.

THANK YOU- SO MISSED. CURIS GHETTO SEATTLE'S OKAY SO YOU'RE A US WITH THAT SO YOUR INTEREST MILL FAILING HOW BEHALF OF CPSE SPONSORS THE BILL- I'LL JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW AT. WORTHINGTON IS- THE ONLY THERE'S TWO COMPANIES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE DOING THE REFILLABLE PROPANE TANKS THAT STUFF LINKING AND- I BELIEVE. IT IS- START AT MANCHESTER SO IT AS SENATOR MCCASKEY STATED YOU KNOW OR THE TEN RIGHT NOW CAN GO AHEAD AND YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BASICALLY WHERE IT STATED ON WHERE THEY CAN. FORM THAT SAFETY RELIEF VALVES SO WE'RE INTO RIGHT NOW CAN DESIGN THE CYLINDER IN A WAY THAT COULD BE REFILLABLE AND DO A SIMILAR KIND OF DESIGN THAT FLAME KING AND MANCHESTER. HAVE DONE IT BEFORE IN THE PAST- AND DOUG COBLE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT BILL MORE THAT- Q. AND DID YOU. YEAH THANK YOU FEATURE AND MEMBERS- OF THE COMMITTEE I HAVE SOME PANELS I'D LIKE TO HAND THE SERGEANT. AND MADE I THINK WILL HELP ABSOLUTELY THERE WE GO THANK YOU- I THINK THAT THESE WILL HELP. TO GUIDE YOU BECAUSE WHAT CENTER LIKE HEALTHY EXPLAINED YOU WITH THE SERVICE CONNECTED VALVE THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE THE BLEEDER VALVE THERE ARE A LOT OF VALVES. AND YOU'LL SEE THESE AS ON ON THE- SHEETS THEM HAND OUT BUT I THINK I'LL CLARIFY FOR YOU THAT- AT CENTER WHAT BECAUSE HE POINTED OUT. THE PATENT THAT FLAME KING HOUSE IS ONLY ON THE LOCATION OF THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE AS A SAFETY MEASURE IN CASE THE PROPANE CYLINDER WITH IT EITHER DURING FILLING OR DURING TRANSPORTATION- ANY TIME. STARTS TO EXCEED THE SAFE. PRESSURE WITHIN THE CONTAINER THAT BALBAN UP AND RELEASES I NEVER GAS TO BRING IT BACK DOWN TO THAT SAFE PRESSURE. AND SO THAT IS THEIR SAFETY MECHANISM IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A VALVE TO OPEN UP SO THAT YOU COULD RELEASE ERROR TO REFILL THESE. THE CYLINDERS AND SO- FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY REFILL IN THE SINGLE USE CYLINDERS ARE ONE VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW. BECAUSE IF YOU'VE READ POLICE AND THEN PUT THEM OUT ON THE ROAD TO GET ON THE ROAD YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN VIOLATION OF THE DOT FEDERAL LAW A COOK. CAL COULD AT THE RELATED REGULATIONS- AND THEN TO YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF AT RISK BECAUSE NOW THAT. THE CYLINDER HAS DONE SOMETHING ISSUED A NEVER BEEN DONE IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED. TO BE REFILLED AND- BY THE SO CALLED. ALL THE- SAFETY RELIEF. ISSUE N. THE CONNECTION VALVE IN THE BILL VALVE UNTIL I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THAT. THAT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A PATENT ON THE STEM WHICH IS WHERE FLAME KING. CHOSE TO IN BED THE STATE'S RELIEF VALVE AND IN THE STATE TO RELIEF EVENT WHAT YOU ALSO SEE IN THOSE DIAGRAMS. WHICH IS RIGHT BELOW THAT SEEKS TO REPEAT VALVES UTTERED A LOUD THAT ALLOW THE TO BE. RELEASED AND SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL HELP. YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER THE ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A PATENT. WALK DOWN HERE ARE NOT.

MY CLIENTS LETTER AND YOU KNOW EVERY ALL CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD ON THE ON THE PATENT ISSUE- IT'S AN INTEGRATED VALVE AND SO AND IT'S INTEGRATED VALVE FOR A REFILLABLE CYLINDER AND FROM OUR CLIENT DOESN'T MAKE A ONE POUND REFILLABLE CYLINDERS SO THEY DON'T. AND THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW. TO HAVE A SAFETY VALVE- HE YOU'D HAVE TO YOU'D HAVE T GET THIS PATENT HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THIS PATENT AND YOU KNOW AND- THE RIGHTS TO THAT AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. TACTIC TO USE SOMEBODY ELSE'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SO WE STAND BY THE FACT THAT THIS BILL. IS THAT AFFECT THE NET EFFECT IS THAT. THE- THAT WE WORK IN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MARKET. THE ONE POUND CYLINDER THAT THEY DO NOW UNDER YOU KNOW THE COLEMAN BRANDON SOME OTHER BRANDS. AND THE SENATE. BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE PAST OLDER WHITES AND IMPORTS WHO HAVE BRANDS FLAME KEEN AND LITTLE CAMPER. AND SO THAT'S WE WILL ALSO BY THAT IN IN IN AND THAT'S IN FACT. TO GET ARE SIXTEEN POINT POINTED CENTER WHITE HOUSE YOU'VE DONE- MADE IN THIS POINT THE CHAIRMAN. WHAT FONTS IS PRODUCED WITH TO THAT IN QUALITY CAN CENTERS YOU KNOW I THINK I NOT WANT TO BE FOR HIM HE SPEAK FROM BY THING HE THINKS THAT'S THE APPROACH I'M A RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM WOULD ACTUALLY CAPTURE ALL CYLINDERS NOT JUST ONE POUND GAS CYLINDER PROTEINS OWNERS BUT- YOU KNOW. OTHER OTHER ISOBUTANE CYLINDERS ARE USED IN TORCHES THAT ARE USED IN OTHER APPLICATIONS IT WOULD CAPTURE THE REFILLABLE CYLINDERS BECAUSE AT SME POINT THREE FILSON REFILLABLE CYLINDERS WHETHER YOUR PHONE OR NOT THEY HAVE AN END OF LIFE TOO. AND THEY HAVE THE SAME DISPOSAL PROBLEMS AT A DISPOSABLE SOME GRASS AND IS TO MAKE CLEAR WE UNDERSTAND THE WORDS THAT WERE USING. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT CENTER IT'S A DISPOSABLE CYLINDERS KIND OF SINGLE USE OWNER I MEAN I HAVE MY SHOULDERS AND MY GARAGE I'VE HAD FOR YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN MY GARAGE A LONG TIME BECAUSE I DON'T CAN'T THAT MUCH I MEAN I TURNED FIFTY AND I DON'T LIKE. CAMPING ANYMORE BUT BUT BUT YOU GET A LOT OF USES OUT OF IT YOU COULD PROBABLY GET ABOUT YOU KNOW LEAST FIFTEEN THIS IS ADAM. SO THEY THEY HAVE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS THAT I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO BAN I WANT I WANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING OUT ON THE RIVER. THIRTY SECONDS WAS KEEPING WARM AND JUST PUTTING FOOD WITH. WITH DISPOSABLE PROPANE CYLINDERS THE REFILLABLE ONES BECAUSE ABOUT THIS AS MUCH SO YOU KNOW YOU'LL- PLEASE YOU'RE JUST GONNA CALL IT CAUSE PEOPLE TO SPEND MORE MONEY. TO STAY WARM AT NIGHT.

QUESTIONS FROM THOSE HERE PRESENT THIRD RUSSELL YES- I JUST I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT- SENATE WHITE HOUSE Q. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY. YOU WANT TO WORK ON THIS- ALTERNATIVE. TO THE BAND SOME. YEAH YEAH AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A BAND IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT. OF THE ALTERNATIVE TO IT AND IT'S COINCIDENTALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT EARLIER TODAY UNDER A PREVIOUS A BILL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS GREEN ECONOMY RIGHT AND HERE WE HAVE. THE THREAT OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX WORKERS RIGHT. MAKING GOOD MONEY REPRESENTED BY A UNION DOING GOOD WORK- ABIDING BY YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS ON. AIR AND WATER QUALITY- I MEAN THE DOING ALL THE GOOD STUFF THAT A COMPANY SHOULD BE DOING SO I DON'T. I WANT THEM TO LOSE THEIR JOBS IF THEY'RE DOING GOOD STUFF IF WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO REAP REDO IT OR REBOOT IT SO THAT'S A COMMITMENT I'M I'M HOPING TO GET FROM YOU. SURE GO AHEAD IN A WAY BECAUSE HE- THE THOSE GOOD PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN THAT ARE MAKING THESE THESE CONTAINERS COULD MAKE AID RETURNABLE CONTAINER IF THEY HAD TO OR PUT OR THEY COULD CERTAINLY WORK ON THE LINE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A- A REPRIEVE- A VALVE ON IT TO THEY HAVE TO RELEASE TO THERE'S NOT THIS PATENT PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. BUT THAT'S THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT EITHER IS WE WHAT I'VE GOT TO LETTER I'VE I'VE SEEN THE LETTER BUT THEY CAN YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OF GOOD UNION JOBS FOR PEOPLE ARE MAKING RETURNABLE- BOTTLES OR CONTAINERS AND THAT WAS THAT'S THE IDEA THAT WE STARTED OFF YEARS THAT WE WANT TO GET. THESE DISPOSABLE OR NON RENEWABLE CONTAINERS OUT AND GET PEOPLE INTO REUSABLE ONE SICK TO GO CAMPING AND HAVE AND HAVE A PROPANE TANKS I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IF I CAN GET TO THE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY NOBODY ELSE IS DOING THIS MEAN CONNECTICUT HAS A BILL THAT'S BEFORE THEIR LEGISLATURE SO THERE'S NOT LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS. AREA HOW DO YOU GET TO THE DETAILS OF THE COLLECTION YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE CAMPING SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE THE COLLECTED THAT COLLECTIONS OUT OF THE PARKS IN THE PAPER PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T BE OF GOT THIS SPORTING GOODS SOURCES TELL THAT SOME OF THEM ONLY SELL.
