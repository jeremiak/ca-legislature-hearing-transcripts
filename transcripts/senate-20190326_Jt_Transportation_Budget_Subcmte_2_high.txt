INFORMATIONAL HEARING SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. NUMBER. TWO WES CENTER WHITE HOUSE GIVES CHAIR CULTURE IN THIS MEETING WITH ME. SO WE WILL [inaudible] CONVENE -- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL INFORMATIONAL HEARING. SO WE LIKE TO HAVE A EVERYBODY -- SETTLE DOWN IN. TWO DISCUSSING THIS AND BOB YEAH. OKAY -- HELLO EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR COMING TO OUR MEETING TODAY WE I LIKE TO FURTHER. TAKE KNOWLEDGE -- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TESTIFYING BEFORE INFORMATIONAL COMMITTEE MEETING TODAY WE HAVE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THE STATE AUDITOR. THE PEER REVIEW REVIEW GROUP -- LA -- AND MANY MANY LOCAL OFFICIALS -- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND AND MAKE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE -- TODAY'S HEARING IS TO GET A STATUS UPDATE. ON A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PANELISTS TODAY. REGARDING PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT WHAT. ARE THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THE PROJECT IS FACING. AND WHAT OPTIONS -- ARE THERE FOR MOVING FORWARD. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS A MY MONUMENTAL TASK. AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF THEM. ADDITIONALLY WE ALL KNOW THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY. IF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT -- IS KEPT MOVING FORWARD AND THEN BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED NOT ONLY WHAT WILL THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BUT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS AMENDED ADMINISTRATION ALL HAVE A PART IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES. TO MAKE THIS PROJECT A SUCCESS I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH AS THE LEGISLATURE IS THE FUNDING PARTNER. AND HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OVER THE AUTHORITY I WANT THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE CHALLENGES -- IN AN HONEST WAY THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS IT CURRENTLY FACING THE OPTIONS WE HAVE IN MOVING FORWARD PRIOR TO THE DECISION -- BEING MADE ON MOVING FORWARD SO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD -- EXPRESS THEIR OPINION AND THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS FIRST INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- THIS IS BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION IS ALREADY HAPPENING. THE PROJECT IS BEING BUILT RIGHT AWAY IS BEING ACQUIRED. FOR WORKING WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE PROPER OVERSIGHT. OVER THESE ACTIONS AS CHAIR OF OUR COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THOSE TESTIFYING TODAY. ON THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT AND THANK YOU WILL BE -- HAVING OUR FIRST PANEL -- CENTER Y. KOWSKI -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU I WOULD -- CHAIRMAN OF BELL AND DOES THE BUDGETS OF TWO YOU KNOW WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A BIG BOLD -- PROJECT THAT HIS HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THAT THE IDEA OF BUILDING AND CONNECTING TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS -- THAT WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIANS TO MOVE FREELY -- FROM ONE PARTY STATE TO THE OTHER IS IS IS WONDERFUL BUT LIKE MANY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OF THIS SCALE IT HAS HAD MORE OF ITS CHEER SHARE OF CHALLENGES. ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RIGHT OF WAY ISSUES AND OF COURSE. ISSUED INDICATED FUNDING -- ISSUES I SEE MERIT IN BUILDING -- A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK THAT WILL EVENTUALLY LINK -- THE SYSTEMS OF THE BAY AREA WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT I SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT OUR COLLEAGUES. IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE -- SINCE THE VOTERS APPROVED PROP ONE A IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R. FEDERAL PARTNERS QUITE FRANKLY HAVE NOT BEEN -- ARE COOPERATING AND IS GROWING INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO THE POINT THAT WE'VE GOT. THE THREAT OF PULLING AWAY. NINE HUNDRED PLUS MILLION DOLLARS -- IN AND WARNING US THAT THEY MAY TRY TO CLAW BACK. THE OUR OWN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR SLOW. WALKING A SOME OF THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEW UNDER NEPA -- IN OUR% ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE TO BE SIGNED OFF SO. AND I GUESS WE COULDN'T PASS BUT HAVING THAT IS TO SAY THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT HAS BEEN LETHARGIC WHICH IS VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE THE PROJECT. IT HASN'T MATERIALIZED -- TO DATE -- AS WELL AS THE SMELL OTHER LEGISLATORS HAVE FIVE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE A OF EARLY PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO THIS SPRING AS ARE. VIEW HAS SAID IS MAY FIRST IS. CRITICAL TIME FOR THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- PROJECT -- I PRESUME THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS TODAY -- IN THE PRESENTATION WE WILL HAVE YOU IN FRONT OF SUB. TO NEXT MONTH. ON SO WE GET A FURTHER FURTHER UPDATE ON THAT AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT OF THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE IN SEPT TWO WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUN ON THURSDAY IN. IN IN DETAIL AND HOW I KNOW PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION THAT WILL HAVE TO DAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SO. ALTERNATE BACK TO YOU CHAIRMAN BELL LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU SENATOR -- NOW. I LIKE TO CALL THE FIRST PANEL UP -- LOU THOMPSON IS -- GROOVY REVIEW GROUP. ELAINE HOW OUR STATE AUDITOR -- WITH YOUR ASSISTANT -- MARK WREN RD. AND HELEN BERNSTEIN PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY ANALYSIS ANALYST FROM THE LA -- LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. SO -- WELL -- WE'LL HEAR FIRST FROM LOU THOMPSON -- THE STATUTE CREATING I BELIEVE LIEU THE STATUTE CREATING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- AUTHORITY -- CREATED AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PEER REVIEW GROUP -- WHICH LUIS LOOP THOMPSON IS BEEN THE CHAIR OF TO PROVIDE -- OPINIONS TO LEGISLATURE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IS -- TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT VIEW OF THE HIGH SPEED REAL PROJECTS ALL TURN OVER. TO LUKE THOMPSON -- WE ARE WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SALAS WHO IS CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE -- AND IS JOINT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US RUDY. THANK YOU SIR -- LUTON'S AND YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND THEN WE'LL GO DOWN THE LINE TO THE AUDITOR. AND THE LA -- SALUTE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THIS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD. THREE TO TESTIFY TO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A COLD I WARN YOU SO I MAY HAVE A HOARSE VOICE. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE PEER REVIEW GROUP THE LA -- AND THE STATE AUDITOR HAVE REVIEWED AND REPORTED ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS THEY WERE REMARKABLY SIMILAR AND SAYING THAT THE PROJECT IS IN CRISIS. BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINAL AND CONTINUING FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH BETWEEN PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND AVAILABLE FUNDING. THIS PROBLEM HAS AMONG OTHER THINGS MEN A BECAUSE OF THE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. THERE ARE TWO CRITICAL ISSUES ONE DEVELOPING AN AGREED VISION FOR PASSENGER RAIL TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT NOT ONLY. AND TO MATCHING THAT VISION WITH AN ADEQUATE AND STABLE FINANCING PLAN. THE GOVERNOR STATE OF THE UNION OF STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS WAS APPARENTLY ATTENDED THE START A PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE VISION FOR THE PROJECT. BUT IT LEFT IMPORTANT QUESTIONS UNANSWERED. GIVEN THAT THE NEW US DOT AND NOW TO MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION OR ATTEMPTING TO WITHDRAW OFF OR REPROGRAM FEDERAL FUNDING COMMITMENTS. CLARIFYING AND COMMITTING TO THE FUTURE VISION OF THE PROJECT ALONG WITH A COMPATIBLE FUNDING PLAN HAS BECOME EVEN MORE URGENT. THE GOVERNOR SAID I QUOTE RIGHT NOW THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A PATH TO GET FROM SACRAMENTO TO SAN DIEGO LETTER WHAT LITTLE LOAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA. I WISH THERE WERE. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT HE INTENDED TO SAY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FINANCE SOME CONTEXT WOULD BE USEFUL. A RECENT PROPOSITION IN LOS ANGELES ADDED A HANSON SALES TAX AND GENERATED A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORT. THAT'S TWICE THE COST OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. EVERY ONE CENT PER GALLON ADDITION TO GAS AND DIESEL FUEL TAXES AS A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OF A ONE DOLLAR PER VEHICLE ADDITION TO THE REGISTRATION TAX WOULD ADD THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND TRUCK WAIT FEES OR ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. GOING BEYOND TRANSPORTATION AS THEY DID IN LOS ANGELES A 1% ADDITION TO THE STATE SALES TAX WOULD ADD SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. MORE THAN FINANCING THE PROJECT AND I WANT TO ADD HERE. THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS PLAN FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ACTUALLY CALLED FOR FINANCING THE PROJECT FROM A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX OF THIS ISN'T A NEW OR A RADICAL IDEA. A 1% SURCHARGE ON INCOME TAXES WOULD ADD A BILLION ANNUALLY A TENTH OF A PERCENT IN CRIMINAL IN PROPERTY TAXES OR EXCLUSION OF BUSINESS PROPERTY FROM PROP THIRTEEN LIMITS. WE DEAL BETWEEN FIVE AND ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. A 25% HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN SEVERANCE TAX WOULD ADD THREE TO SEVEN BILLION. EVEN AT 2% STATE WIDE SO THE TAX WOULD ADD TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OUR REVIEW FOR SENATOR BILL OUR REVIEW OF THE IS ISSUE REAL ESTATE AND STATEWIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DOES SUPPORT. THE ARGUMENT THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL WOULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND STATION AREAS. AND WOULD HAVE MANIFESTS BENEFITS TO THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENT AND ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT. AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THESE BENEFITS HOWEVER GREAT. WOULD BE ABLE TO YIELD A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION COST OF THE SYSTEM. FINDING MORE FEDERAL MONEY WILL BE A HEAVY LIFT. THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR A REQUEST FOR MORE GRANT MONEY FOR TRANSPORTATION ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA. EVEN IF THIS CHANGES NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS STATE HIGH SPEED RAIL WOULD NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FACE OF LARGE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS. EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS TIGER AND BUILD ARE BEING DOWNSIZED OR ELIMINATED AS OR THE TO FEEL LOANS. RIFF LOANS MIGHT PAY SOME ROLE BUT THEIR LOANS NOT GRANTS IN THIS YEAR THAN ANYONE STATE PROJECT MY CLAIM. IN THE TOTAL PROGRAM IS NOT LARGER NICK LIKELY A LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION. THE PROJECTIONS OF DEMAND AND COST ARGUE THAT THERE WILL EVENTUALLY BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT BUT THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT CLEAR AND IN ANY CASE. THE SYSTEM MUST BE BUILT AND OPERATED FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE COST AND DEMAND RISK CAN BE EVALUATED. PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN FINANCING STATION DEVELOPMENT BUT NOT ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE TO SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION OF THE SYSTEM. AT THE VERY LEAST THERE S A GAP OF SEVERAL TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE COVERED BEFORE THE SYSTEM COULD BEGIN GENERATING INCOME. A SIMPLE STATEMENT WOULD BE THAT IF WE WANT HIGH SPEED RAIL THE STATE WILL NEED TO FIND A WAY TO COVER THE FINANCING GAP. BEYOND WHAT WE ALREADY AND HAVE BEEN HANDY IF WE GET TO KEEP EVEN THAT. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPTIONS FOR PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM AND SOME COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE OR OTHERS THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DEVISE WOULD CLEARLY WORK. THERE IS A PATH IT'S JUST A HARD. ONE THE PEER REVIEW GROUP HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AS AN APPROPRIATE PART OF A STATEWIDE PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM INCLUDING TRANSIT AND LOCAL COMMUTER TRAVEL. UNFORTUNATELY BE A PROP ONE A AND THE FEDERAL ERA PROGRAM WE GOT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. HIGH SPEED RAIL WITHOUT LINKAGE TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. INSPIRING VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL REPLETE WITH DRAMATIC PICTURES OF SPEEDING GOLD AND BLUE TRAINS. BUT PRESENTED IN ADVANCE OF A CREDIBLE FINANCING PLAN IS NOW MEETING REALITY. THEN THE ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE IS BADLY NEEDED. HIGH SPEED WILL CONSTITUTE TO YOUR A DILEMMA OR AN OPPORTUNITY WE THINK IT COULD BE THE LATTER. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR TO ESTABLISH A NEW VISION FOR THE ROLE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. WITHIN THE OVERALL STATE RAIL PASSENGER TRANSPORT SYSTEM. GET THE HORSE BACK IN FRONT OF THE CART. WITH THE REALISTIC VISION BASED ON EXPERIENCE TODAY AND A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BY EVERYBODY OF WHAT WE WANT OUT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP A SCOPE IN FINANCING PLAN THAT WOULD PERMIT STABLE MANAGEMENT. EXPERIENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT A NEW VERSION SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THERE ARE OPTIONS. THE REAL DANGER IS STUMBLING AHEAD WITH NO CLEAR AND AGREED GOAL. IF THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON A VISION THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. AND PROVIDE A CREDIBLE FUNDING APPROACH BASED ON A COMMITMENT FROM THE STATE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE PROGRAM CAN GO FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY. I WISH I COULD BE MORE OPTIMISTIC BUT I THINK THAT'S A VERY REALISTIC STATEMENT OF WHERE WE STAND [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT OVER THE OF OUR STATE WATER LANE HOW LINE. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHAIR WACO SKI AND CHAIR SALAS US SENATORS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND WE'RE GOING TO MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE AND I ARE GOING TO DO IT VERY HIGH LEVEL REVIEW. OF THE AUDIT REPORT WE ISSUED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE CURRENT STATUS OF RESPONSES THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE AUTHORITY REGARDING. OTHER PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN THAT REPORT SO AT A HIGH LEVEL WE HAD THREE KEY ISSUES THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TODAY. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION RISK MANAGEMENT CHANGE ORDERS THE PROCESS. FOR MANAGING THE PROJECT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PARTICULAR PROJECT AND AS WE CONCLUDED IN THE REPORT AND AS AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER NOTED. THE AUTHORITY REALLY MOVED AHEAD WITH CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO REALLY ANALYZING OR UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING SO. AND THE THREE EXAMPLES THAT WE IDENTIFY THE REPORTER THREE ELEMENTS HIS ACQUISITION OF LAND -- ABILITY TO DETERMINE HOW IT WOULD RELOCATE UTILITIES WHAT TE WHAT THE COST OF THAT WOULD BE. AND THEN ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR OTHER RAIL ROAD AND UNION PACIFIC FOR EXAMPLE IS WHAT WE MENTION IN THE REPORT. AND BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY. MOVED FORWARD WITH CONSTRUCTION BEFORE REALLY UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THE RISKS MITIGATING TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT THE THREE PROJECTS THAT WE LOOKED AT DURING THE AUDIT -- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COST OVERRUNS DELAYS IN THE TIME -- FOR COMPLETING THE PROJECT THE COST OVERRUNS AS OF JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE FINISHED OUR FIELD WORK WAS AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE THREE ELEMENTS I JUST TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS ACQUIRING LAND -- WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT. THERE IS THE ABILITY TO RELOCATE UTILITY SYSTEMS SO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COST OVERRUNS DELAYS IN THE PROJECT AND AS WE SHOW IN THE REPORT. THE MOST RECENT -- ANALYSIS THAT WE HAD SEEN WITH FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE VALLEY TO VALLEY AS IT'S CALLED THESE THREE PROJECTS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS BEING PUSHED OUT TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE CONCERN WITHOUT THAT WE RAISE AND DISCUSSING THE AUDIT REPORT AND THE AUTHORITIES. WELL AWARE IS THE FEDERAL DEADLINE -- FOR MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE RECOVERY ACT THE ERA MONEY IS DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE'RE PUSHING UP AGAINST THAT PARTICULAR. DEADLINE ALSO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PACE OF CONSTRUCTION WE CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON PAST. HISTORY AND ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT SKEWS ME THAT THE AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE TO WORK TWICE AS QUICKLY AS IT HAS IN THE PAST TO BE ABLE TO MEET. ON THAT PARTICULAR DEADLINE SO CERTAINLY HAD CONCERNS WITH RISK MANAGEMENT. CONSTRUCTION ETCETERA WE ALSO LOW WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CHANGE ORDERS LOOK AT THE PROCESS THAT THE AUTHORITY HAD FOR APPROVING KNOWS CHANGE ORDERS THEY CERTAINLY HAVE CONSULTANTS ON BOARD. TO ASSIST THEM IN ASSESSING THOSE CHANGE ORDERS IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE FULLY JUSTIFIED. IN SOME CASES WE SAW THAT THE AUTHORITY HE DID THAT ADVICE FROM CONSULTANTS BUT IN OTHER CASES WE SAW THAT THEY DID NOT. AND THEY ULTIMATELY APPROVED CHANGE ORDERS THAT WERE HIGHER HIGHER DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAN WHAT THEIR CONSULTANTS -- SUGGESTED -- AND WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IS JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE FOR WHY THE THE AUTHORITY FELT THEY NEEDED -- TO EXCEED THE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THEIR OWN CONSULTANTS AND WE DIDN'T SEE THAT KIND OF EVIDENCE SO WE FELT THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE. A STRENGTHENING OF SOME OF THEIR CONSTRUCTING CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT THE CHANGE ORDER PROCESS. SO THAT'S THE FIRST AREA. THE SECOND AREA WE LOOK AT HIS CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CENTRE BELL IS ONE OF THE REQUESTED THIS AUDIT REALLY ASKED US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HIGH SPEED RAIL WHAT KIND OF STRUCTURE DO THEY HAVE IN PLACE. TO MANAGE ALL THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT THEY HAVE THE CONTRACTOR'S -- THAT THEY'VE ENGAGED TO A SYSTEM IN THIS PROJECT AND AS WE HAD IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN WE ISSUE A REPORT WE FOUND SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS -- IN THE CURRENT AUDIT THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS AUDITS WHERE THE AUTHORITY WAS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON CONSULTANTS. DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH IN HOUSE STATE STAFF TO OVERSEE THOSE -- CONSULTANTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE PROPERLY MANAGING CONTRACTS ALSO SOME OF THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED WERE REALLY POOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- NOT NECESSARILY REVIEWING ALL OF THE INVOICES EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST AREA THAT WE LOOKED AT WHERE WE WERE REALLY CONCERNED IS. MONITORING CONTRACTS MAKING SURE THAT THE DELIVERABLES THAT WERE -- DILIP PROVIDED TO THE AUTHORITY HER COMPLETED -- WERE OF THE RIGHT QUALITY THE APPROPRIATE DELIVERABLE SO THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF REALLY. THESE CONTRACT MANAGERS ARE SHARING THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WAS GETTING -- WHAT THEY WERE PAYING FOR SO WE REALLY HAD SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IN THE CONTRACT -- MANAGEMENT. ARENA THE LAST THING I'LL TALK ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THAT IS -- WHEN WE ASK CONTRACT MANAGERS FOR EVIDENCE OF AMENDMENTS AND A REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT NOT ONLY FOR FOUR DOLLARS BUT FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WAS GOING TO BE ADDED ON TO A PARTICULAR PROJECT? WE WERE AGAIN WE'RE NOT SEEING SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN MOST CASES OF WHO REVIEWED THAT WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION WAS WHETHER THERE WAS LEGITIMATE RATIONALE -- FOR APPROVING THAT PARTICULAR AMENDMENT. SO REALLY SOME ARE CONTINUING CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT MANAGEMENT THE AUTHORITY DID CREATE ITS OWN CONTRACT MANAGEMENT -- UNIT SUPPORT UNIT TO REVIEW CONTRACTS AND CONTRACTORS BUT AGAIN WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE STRUCTURE OF THAT UNIT WE FOUND THAT. YOU KNOW HE SUPERVISOR OF THE UNIT IS A STATE EMPLOYEE MOST OF THE OTHER. INDIVIDUALS WERE CONTRACTORS WHO WERE ULTIMATELY REVIEWING OTHER CONTRACTORS WORK SO THE STRUCTURE ITSELF -- WAS PROBLEMATIC SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT. THE THIRD AREA THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT WAS -- THE AUTHORITIES POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABILITY AND THERE TRANSPARENCY IN THE REPORTING OUT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT -- AND AND WE CONCLUDED IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA THAT WE HIRED A CONSULTANT TO ASSIST US WITH SUSTAINABILITY. AND OUR CONSULTANT INFORMED US AND WE JUST DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT THAT THE POLICIES THAT THE AUTHORITY DEVELOPED WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABILITY WERE ACTUALLY QUITE STRONG. AND ALIGNED WITH BEST PRACTICES WHAT WHAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THERE WAS NO SEPARATION BETWEEN. THE SUSTAINABILITY IN THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF A FULLY FUNCTIONING HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM VERSES THE IMPACT THAT CURRENT CONSTRUCTION IS HAVING WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABILITY SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS -- THAT ARE CONSULTANT ASSISTED US WITH TO THE AUTHORITY OF GOT A SEPARATE THOSE TWO OUT AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE IMPACT IS WITH RESPECT TO SUSTAINABILITY. AND AND YET AT THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT DURING CONSTRUCTION CERTAINLY CAN AND HAVE THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM GETTINGPEOPLE OUT OF CARS. NOT TAKING AIRPLANES IT CETERA. THE OTHER -- ISSUE RELATED TRANSPARENCY THE SENATOR AND AND THE OTHER REQUEST THURS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER ON BELOW AND PATTERSON ASKED US TO LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT SMALL BUSINESS DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS A DISADVANTAGE BUSINESSES MICRO BUSINESSES ARE THOSE BUSINESSES. ARE GAINING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THE REPORT IS THE ANSWER IS YES -- THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES FOR CONTRACTING WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY PRIMARILY AND AND PERSONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS WHICH MAKES SENSE. A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO PROVIDE CONSTRUCTION SERVICES -- BUT THEY CERTAINLY CAN PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICES OUT TO THE AUTHORITY SO -- THE AUTHORITY SET A VERY. HIGH BAR I MEAN THEY WANTED TO ACHIEVE A 30%. ARE UTILIZATION RATE AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE ANALYSIS WE SAW THAT IT WAS APPROACHING 30% SO THEY WERE REALLY HAVE DONE. A RELATIVELY GOOD JOB AND WORKING WITH THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IN AND CONTRACT WITH THE AUTHORITY. WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WE SAW ABOUT A 16% UTILIZATION RATE THERE SO AGAIN RELATIVELY GOOD. RESPONSE FROM THAT. THE LAST ISSUE IS THE ECONOMIC MODELLING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND AGAIN WHEN WE LOOKED AT THEIR MODELS AND THEIR METHODOLOGY -- WE FELT THAT IT WAS VERY STRONG -- CERTAINLY AGAIN ALIGNED WITH BEST PRACTICES THEY ARE REPORTING OUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE HIGH LEVEL ISSUES WE HAD A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AS YOU KNOW MEMBERS WHEN MY OFFICE ISSUES AN AUDIT REPORT -- WE HAVE GIVE THE ENTITY THAT WE'VE AUDITED THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AS PART OF THE OUR REPORT BUT WE HAVE A FOLLOW UP PROCESS SIXTY DAYS SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR SUBSEQUENT. TO THAT PUBLICATION WE HAVE RECEIVED THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHORITY AND I'M GONNA HANDED OFF TO MR REINER TO HE WILL GO THROUGH AT A HIGH LEVEL. THE NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE IN EACH OF THOSE THREE AREAS AND BASICALLY THE STATUS -- OF THE THE AUTHORITIES PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR A MISTER SURE MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARK CRINER DE AND THE SENIOR AUDITOR WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE -- AS A STEPDAUGHTER -- SUMMARIZED WE HAVE THREE AREAS -- AND WHICH WE'VE GROUPED OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION TO SUMMARIZE THEM FOR YOU TODAY -- BY WAY OF A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY ABOUT ALL. OUTSTANDING RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE SEVENTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY ACROSS THE STREET SUBJECT MATTER AREAS -- AS OF THE SIXTY DAY MARK WHICH WAS A JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH JANUARY FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE TO TURN AT TEN OF THOSE SEVENTEEN OF BEEN PARTIAL PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. AND AND SEVEN ARE PENDING IN INSOFAR AS WE ARE. STILL WORKING WITH YOU FOR DETERMINE -- STEPS THEY'VE TAKEN IN THAT PROPERTY TAKEN DOCUMENT FOR US -- WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND CHANGE ORDER -- AREA TO THIS AREA -- FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND THE ASSOCIATED RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES FOR BOTH THOSE CONTRACTS AND YOU FUTURE PLANNED A DESIGN BUILD A CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. THE THIRTY HAS PERSON COMMITTED TO OF THE SIX RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MADE IN THIS AREA. ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE CHANGE ORDER REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE STATE AUDITOR SUMMARIZED -- INSURING THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE THE DETERMINATION IS MADE BY THE AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO REQUESTED CHANGE ORDERS. ARE IN LINE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE APPROPRIATE WITH THE THE CONSULTANTS THE OVERSIGHT FIRMS THAT HIRES TO TO ASSIST IN THIS WAY. THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION WHICH HAS BEEN PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE AUTHORITY HAS TO DO WITH QUARTER REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING. THE PROGRESS IT IS MAKING IN COMPLETING CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION AS TRACKED AGAINST THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT IT IT CURRENTLY A PROJECT IT WILL NEED TO COMPLETE. AND DOING SO. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DECEMBER. TWENTY TWO DEADLINE FOR THE ERA A GRANT -- IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT TO THAT RECOMMENDATION THE AUTHORITY ISSUED A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND PUBLISH ON ITS WEBSITE AT THE END OF JANUARY -- THAT -- THAT REPORT TO CONTAIN ASPECTS OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE RECOMMENDED THE REPORT CONTAINED WITH RESPECT -- TO THE URBAN VALUE MODEL OF OF OF REPORTING ON CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS HOWEVER WE PROVIDED FEEDBACK IN OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS. THAT THE AUTHORITY NEEDED TO UPDATE THE DATA IN -- IN THAT MODELING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS THE MOST UP TO DATE AND ACCURATE POSSIBLE MINUTE REFLECTS -- THE BEST IDEA CAN POINT TIME FOR OUTSTANDING RISKS EXPECTED COSTS AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE. THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHER USERS OF THAT REPORT WITH A A BETTER IDEA OF HOW PROGRESS HOW IT HOW -- THE WORK IS ACCELERATING ORG OR ALTERNATELY DECIPHERING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGAIN WITH THE THE END GOAL BEING THAT DECEMBER. TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. OTHER RECOMMENDATION THIS IN THIS AREA HAVE TO DO WITH THE OVERSIGHT BY THE AUTHORITY OF THOSE FIRMS IT EMPLOYS TO HELP IT -- MONITOR CONTRACT PERFORMANCE -- CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS SOME RISK MITIGATION STEPS THAT WE RECOMMENDED THE AUTHORITY TAKE PRIOR. TO EXECUTING FURTHER CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND OTHER PORTIONS OF THE OF THE SYSTEM. WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL CONTRACT MANAGEMENT WE PERFORMED AND AN EVALUATION OF THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES BY THE AUTHORITY -- WITH RESPECT TO OTHER NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED CONTRACTS THESE WERE. NINE LARGE CONTRACTS RELATED TO A CONSULTING SERVICES THE REAL DELIVERY PARTNER INCLUDED -- ALSO FINANCIAL ADVISING CONTRACTS OF MANY OF THE REGIONAL CONSULTING CONTRACTS ARE ASSISTING WITH OBTAINING -- DIRECTOR OF DECISION THE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING APPROVAL. AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR -- SUMMARIZE WE FOUND. FAIRLY WIDESPREAD NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE AUTHORITIES OWN. PRACTICES IN THAT AREA ON THE THIRTY HAD ACTUALLY PRIOR TO OUR ENGAGEMENT -- DEVELOPED A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF POLICIES ABOUT WHAT CONTRACT MANAGERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DOING IN A WITH MANY OF THE SAME THINGS THAT WE SAW WE SAW THEM HOW IT IS THAT THEY WERE NOT PERFORMING SUCH AS REVIEW OF OF INVOICES. ENSURING THAT DELIVERABLE QUALITY WAS OF A HOT BUT YOU KNOW WAS APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY. SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY THAT AREA HAVE TO DO MORE WITH SHORING UP THE PROFESSIONAL A FULL TIME CONTRACT MANAGEMENT STAFF THAT A A PROGRAM THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON ON OUTSIDE RESOURCES THAT HAS THIS DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH IT REALLY WARRANTS. TO THAT END THE AUTHORITY HAS PARTIAL IMPLEMENT ITS THREE OF OUR SIX RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA HAS TAKEN STEPS TO DRAFT. A DUTY STATEMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH FULL TIME CONTRACT MANAGER -- POSITIONS AS WE RECOMMENDED HOW THEY HAVE INITIATED TRAINING FOR THE SUPERVISOR TO CONTRACT MANAGERS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE SUPERVISORS ARE EQUIPPED TO EVALUATE THEIR SUBORDINATES PERFORMANCE IN THIS AREA -- THEY'VE ALSO LAID OUT A SCHEDULE BY WHICH THEY ARE ASSESSING THE THE WIDE RANGE OF CONTRACTS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO GET TO BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST THE SHEER VOLUME -- SO THAT AREAS WHERE THEY ARE STILL WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THEM TO SEE DEMONSTRATE IMPROVEMENT HAVE TO DO WITH THE COMPLETION OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS -- THE THE ACTUAL -- TOOLS THAT YOU ARE USING TO PROVIDE THOSE ASSESSMENTS. AS WELL AS TO BRING STATE STAFF INTO POSITIONS THAT OVERSEE CONTRACT MANAGERS AND BY EXTENSION OTHER CONTRACTORS. THE AUTHORITIES INDICATED IS TAKEN STEPS IN IN THOSE AREAS WE HAVE YET TO SEE IT ACTUALLY EXECUTE ANY OF THOSE PLANS. I SHOULD I SHOULD MENTION THAT. A HIGH LEVEL THE AUTHORITY HAS INDICATED TO US THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IT PLANS TO HAVE IMPLEMENTED FULLY BY THE SIX MONTH MARK IN MAY TWENTY NINETEEN SO -- THAT WILL BE. SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR AND WORKING WITH THEM LEADING UP. TO TO THAT DATE. FINALLY IN THE SUSTAINABILITY AREA AT THE AUTHORITY HAS PARKING FERMENTED ALL FIVE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE. FOUR OF THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY POLICY DELINEATING CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS FROM. THE THE PROJECTED IN A ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM. AND AT A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL -- IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF ITS DATA COLLECTION AND I TRACKING AND REPORTING OF CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS TO DATE. OF THE AUTHORITY HAS PROVIDED US WITH. AT SIX AT SIXTY DAYS PROVIDE US WITH DRAFT VERSIONS OF OF A VARIETY OF NEW REPORTS AS WELL AS NEW POLICIES RELATED TO VALIDATING ITS DATA. THE QUALITY OF ITS CONSTRUCTION RELATED DATA -- THOSE THOSE PROJECTS ARE IN DIFFERENT STATES OF OF COMPLETION BUT ALL ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE CONCLUDED IN THE REPORT. AND THEN FINALLY THE AYE WITH RESPECT TO SMALL BUSINESS REPORTING. IT IS IS VERY MUCH TRUE THAT THE AUTHORITY IS. IS REACHING OUR OUR PER PROTEIN IT'S CALLED 30% THE TIME OF OUR REVIEW. HOWEVER -- THAT NUMBER DOES NOT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF OF CONTRACTING MONEY THAT'S GOING TOWARDS. OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES PUBLIC PARTNERS LOCALITIES -- WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THEIR OWN A SMALL BUSINESS OR A DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS OR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS SO WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE AUTHORITY THAT THEY? JUST SIMPLY BE MORE INCLUSIVE IN THEIR REPORTING HAVING MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHICH CONTRACT AMOUNTS THEY DAY EXEMPT FROM THE DENTURES JUST IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT THEY HAVE. CREATED A METHODOLOGY FOR MAKING THOSE CALCULATIONS AND PRESENTING THEM AND SO WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE THOSE CALCULATIONS IN PLACE NOT REPORTING A PLACE AT SIX MONTHS. THANK YOU THANK YOU OF FROM THE SENATE FROM THE STATE ORDER OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO TO YOU AN ALTERNATE OVER. TO HELEN FOR CHRISTINE -- PRINCIPLE FISCAL POLICY ANALYST FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HELLO ANY OTHER. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND SENATORS HI CHRISTINE AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT THAT PARALLELS MY REMARKS. I MEAN IT PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON THE PROJECT ALL STAR WHICH IS A VERY RIEF BACKGROUND ON THE PROJECT I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE SORT OF OPERATING FROM THE SAME BASE UNDERSTANDING. ALL PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ON THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO THE PROJECT AS FAR AND HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT. ALL ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT-THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT AND THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- ONE WITH RIGHT JUST SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW STATE LAW REQUIRES THE AUTHORITY TO PREPARE A BUSINESS PLAN EVERY EVEN YEAR AND THE LAST BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS -- PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY WAS IN JUNE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE'S ALSO A REQUIREMENT FOR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BASICALLY UPDATE A BUSINESS PLAN -- TYPICALLY THAT'S EXPECTED IN MARCH WHERE IN YOUR WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT -- HAS BEEN DELAYED A BIT AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN MAY AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN A FEW MINUTES. SO -- THE PROJECT DELIVERY PLANNED I DESCRIBE HERE -- IS BASICALLY WHAT'S REFLECTED IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN IT'S CHANGED A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME -- REALLY A KEY COMPONENT IS THAT THE PROJECT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO MAIN PHASES OF PHASE ONE WOULD GO FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM IT'S A TO ANTICIPATED TO COST ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ALTHOUGH THERE'S A RANGE THAT THE AUTHORITY IS PROVIDED. AND THE COMPLETED BY -- TWENTY THIRTY THREE THERE'S ALSO A PHASE TWO WHICH WOULD EXTEND TO SACRAMENTO AND ALSO TO SAN DIEGO -- CURRENTLY THERE'S NO SCHEDULER COST ESTIMATE FOR THAT PHASE IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE Q. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MAP THAT SHOWS PHASE ONE AND THAT'S THE THE PORTION THAT'S IN. KIND OF A GRAY -- A GREAT AREA. THEN PHASE ONE IS DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS -- YOU'LL SEE THAT'S ACTUALLY SHOWN WITH THE LITTLE -- KIND OF THE THE EDGES THERE -- THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS IS WHERE -- OPERATIONS ARE INTENDED TO BE AGAIN THAT'S BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND BAKERSFIELD -- AND THAT'S ALSO KNOWN AS ABOUT ABOUT A LINE O YOU'LL BE OF HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL THAT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE AND COST ABOUT TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION. AND THEN THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT IS FURTHER AND DIVIDED -- WITH THE FIRST CONSTRUCTION OCCURRING ON WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT THAT EXTENDS HERE AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE DASHED LINE BETWEEN MADERA. AND CHAPTER. THAT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO I CAUGHT ABOUT TEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO IF YOU ALONG WITH A MAP WE JUST MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A BOOK AND THEN CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT. ARE THE TORTILLAS UNDERTAKING WITH LOCAL PARTNERS -- TO IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS AND FACILITATE CONNECTIVITY TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT ON A SUBSEQUENT PANEL BUT JUST WANTED TO REFERENCE THAT. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE THREE MAIN SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED. SO THE FIRST ONE IS PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS SO PROPOSITION ONE A WAS APPROVED BY VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT PROVIDED TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS NINE BILLION WAS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT ITSELF. ABOUT A BILLION WAS FOR CONNECTIVITY PROJECTS AND THEN THAT NINE BILLION -- WAS FURTHER DIVIDED ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION WAS SET ASIDE FOR THOSE BUT CAN PROJECTS THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT LATER. THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION HAS BEEN SPENT ABOUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION OF THAT ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT ITSELF. AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ON THOSE CONNECT TO BE PROJECTS. THE SECOND CATEGORY OF FUNDS THAT THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY BE TALKING ABOUT THAT -- MORE TODAY IS THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AWARDED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO MAJOR GRANTS TOTALING THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FIRST THE STATE RECEIVED TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND FROM THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OR ARE A GRANT. PROCESS. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS FULLY EXPENDED THESE FUNDS AND IS ANTICIPATING MATCHING OF THOSE FINES AND MEETING THAT MATCH REQUIREMENT BY. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THEN SECOND THE STATE RECEIVED ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION FROM A SECOND GRANT THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE FY TEN FEDERAL GRANT. THAT EXPIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS WE'VE HEARD THAT KIND OF A KEY DATE FOR THE AUTHORITY -- THAT GRANT HAS OF RADIO PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS A FEW THE KEY ONES INCLUDE THAT -- BEFORE THIS THE STATE CAN SPEND THAT MONEY WE HAVE TO COMPUTER MATCH ON THE AIRCRAFT SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T SPENT ANY OF THAT MONEY YET WE HAVEN'T COMPLETED THAT MATCH -- BUT ONCE WE COMPLETE THAT MUCH WE CAN ACCESS THOSE FUNDS. SECONDS THOSE FUNDS CAN HAVE TO BE USED TO SUPPORT INTER CITY RAIL PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE -- AND THEN THIRD WE HAVE TO COMPLETE ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS FOR PHASE ONE BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WHETHER OR NOT WE COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION OF ALL PHASE ONE WE HAVE TO DO ALL OF THAT -- BERMAN REVIEW PROCESS. THE AGREEMENT DOES HAVE SOME PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TERMINATE THAT GRANT AGREEMENT -- FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE FAILS TO MAKE WHAT'S KNOWN AS REASONABLE PROGRESS ON THE PROJECT. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALERTED THE STATE THAT IT INTENDED TO EXERCISE THAT PROVISION AND TERMINATE THOSE FUNDS -- AND THAT THAT NOTIFICATION CAME IN FEBRUARY THE AUTHORITY HAS RESPONDED WITH A COUPLE OF LETTERS. WITH A POINT BY POINT REBUTTAL OF THAT -- BUT STILL THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA DO WITH THOSE FUNDS AND SO THE STATE IS IS IS WAITING TO TO FIND A CONCLUSION ON ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THOSE FUNDS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE HIGHLIGHT THE THIRD MAIN SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHORITY INTO THE PROJECT WHICH IS CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AT CENTER WHAT HOUSE YOU MENTIONED. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE STATE BEGAN TO PROVIDE CAP AND TRADE AUCTION PROCEEDS TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THIS INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. AS WELL AS CONTINUES APPROPRIATION OF 25% OF REVENUES I'M A NOT BEGAN AND AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SO TO DATE THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE REVENUES AND SPENT ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE WE HAVE A A SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE RECENT -- PROGRESS IN THAT AS STATUS OF THE PROJECT FIRST WITH REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS THE AUTHORITY HAS TO COMPLY WITH NOT ONLY THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACTORS SEAQUEST. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW INCLUDING THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OR NEED BACK. WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT FOR REFERENCE TO THAT -- AND SOME OF THAT THE CHALLENGES THE STATE'S HAVING IN TERMS OF GETTING THE ABILITY TO SORT OF A MINISTER THAT PEACE. BUT BOTH OF THOSE LAWS REQUIRE THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THE PROJECT TO DETERMINE IF IT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. TO THE FORTY HAS COMPLETED A BUYER MIDDLE REVIEWS OF MERCED TO FRESNO AND FRESNO TO BAKERSFIELD THOSE SECTIONS. BUT IT'S STILL IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE REMAINING REVIEWS FOR PHASE. ONE NEXT RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION AND I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO REFERENCE TO THIS IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT PORTION OF COMPLETING ANY MAJOR FAT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS. ONE THE AUTHORITY HAS IDENTIFIED OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SEPARATE PARCELS JUST FOR THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AND TODAY HAS ACQUIRED OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE BUT THAT LEAVES ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED OF THOSE PARCELS THAT STILL NEED TO BE ACQUIRED. WITH REGARD TO CONSTRUCTION THE AUTHORITY -- BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IS IT SPENT ALMOST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AT THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. I'D COMPLETED SOME MAJOR STRUCTURES AND IT'S ALSO WHAT REALIGNED A PORTION OF THE NINETY NINE FREEWAY -- YOUR FRESNO. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX WE HIGHLIGHT FOR MAJOR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE PROJECT FACES A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING CAP AND YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ALREADY BUT THIS TABLE KIND OF SHOWS SHOWS THE NUMBERS HERE THAT WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE HELPFUL -- SO BASED ON THE NUMBERS IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN THERE'S A FUNDING GAP PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT -- WELL UPWARDS OF FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- AT THE LOW END IT COULD BE FIFTY FIVE BILLION AT THE HIGH END MAYBE FIFTY EIGHT BILLION -- AND IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TERMINATES THAT GRANT FY TEN GRANT THAN THE FUNDING GAP WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT A NOT ANOTHER NINE HUNDRED MILLION. A LARGER TO AT THIS TIME THE AUTHORITY HASN'T IDENTIFIED HOW THIS CHECKED FUNDING SHORTFALL WOULD BE MATT. AND THERE CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT RISK THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE SHORTFALL I'M PRIVATE FUNDING HASN'T YET EMERGED -- SO IT'S LIKELY THAT THE STATE THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND OR THROUGH SOME OTHER -- MEANS IF THERE'S ANOTHER AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO COVER THAT. ALSO WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR SIGNIFICANT -- UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THAT THIS COST ESTIMATE -- THIS IS A VERY LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS CAMERON -- AND YOU EXPERIENCE COST OVERRUNS AND SO -- THERE'S CERTAINLY A RISK THAT THAT THE COST COULD BE ON THE HANDS FEDERATION ONE OF THEM IS THE PEER REVIEW GROUPS CONSISTS CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH MISTER THOMPSON MENTIONED -- ESSENTIALLY FOCUSING ON THE CHALLENGE OF OF MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT A RELIABLE AN ADEQUATE FUNDING STREAM FOR THE PROJECT GIVEN THAT AND GIVEN THAT FUNDING GAP THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. ALSO THE PEER REVIEW GROUP DID IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. I I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE WORK AS EARLY -- TOTALLY COMPREHENSIVE THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO START THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL -- THE NEXT ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE GOVERNOR THE SHIFT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS -- HAS INDICATED HE'S MAKING IN TERMS OF HIS HIS APPROACH TO THIS PROJECT IN THAT STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. A AS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT A GREAT LIKE THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT -- YOU APPROACH IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE -- HE DID MENTION THAT THE PROJECT AS PLAN WOULD COST TO MATCH AND TAKE TOO LONG -- AND HE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR STARTING WITH THIS MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SECTIONS THAT EXPECT. LARGER STRETCH THAN THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT BUT NOT THE ENTIRE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENTS. SO STARTING WITH THAT COMPLETING THE BOOK IN PROJECTS THAT THE LOCALS ARE UNDERTAKING AND COMPLETING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR PHASE ONE WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE FEDERAL GRANTS -- AGAIN THE SPECIFICS OF THAT PROPOSAL ARE UNCERTAIN WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE MORE IN MAY AND PERHAPS THAT OR YOU CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT. SO THE FOURTH ISSUE -- THAT WE REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S A CONSIDERATION IS THAT THIS SHIFT IN AN PLAN AND APPROACH THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAKING WE THINK REALLY PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN OPPORTUNITY A STEP BACK. AND CONSIDER. WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO AND HOW THE PROJECT WISE WITH ITS PRIORITIES -- GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER -- WHETHER IT'S COMFORTABLE FINDING THOSE REVENUES WHEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT THEY COULD BE GENERATED ADDITIONAL REVENUE COULD BE GENERATED ORG OR OTHER PRIORITIES COULD BE SHIFTED. BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP AND SO THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT IS COMFORTABLE PROVIDING THOSE FUNDS -- IF NOT IT WILL WANT TO CONSIDER. VARIOUS OTHER APPROACHES AND THAT THAT COULD BE THE GOT WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SUGGESTED IT COULD BE ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES THE PEER REVIEW GROUP BOB POINTED OUT. IT COULD BE SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACH -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO TRY. TO MAKE SOME -- SOME CLEAR DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THE STATE'S GOING TO GO ON THIS PROJECT SO WE DON'T END UP I'M SPENDING MONEY ON ACTIVITIES ULTIMATELY WE DECIDED NOT. TO MAKE YOU SEVEN THE FUTURE AS WE THINK THOSE DECISIONS HOPEFULLY INFORMED BY THE INFORMATION THAT WE RECEIVE IN MAY -- WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO UNDERTAKE [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE CAN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS NOW OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- OF BLUE TARPS AND IN TERMS OF OPTIONS WE'RE WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A BASIC OPTIONS WE HAVE. AT THIS POINT -- COMING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. TIONS FOR SCOPE OR FOR PAYING FOR THIS GOAL AND HOW HOW. HOW SHOULD WE PROCEED? AT THIS POINT -- TO OF DEAL WITH% THE ISSUES AT HAND THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT. OF THE GOVERNOR YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING. TO COME UP WITH A REVISION TO THE BUSINES PLAN. WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS SHOULD WE LOOK AT BEFORE YOU MAKE THAT FINALDECISION? I WISH I THOUGHT I COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND IT AND OF COURSE ARE GOING ON AND ANY. USE BUT WHAT WHAT WE RECOMMEND pIS THAT YOU ASK THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO WORK WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. TO TELL YOU WHAT THE FUTURE OF RAILPASSENGER TRANSPORTATION AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK LIKE INCLUDING HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUT NOT ONLY HIGH SPEED RAIL AND I EMPHASIZE THAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT SHOULD THE SYSTEM LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ROLE SHOULD A HIGH SPEED RAIL PLAY. I THINK THE SECOND THING IS NOT TO GET TOO HUNG UP ON DOING IT RIGHT AWAY. THE END OF THE DISH THAT WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME WE CAN PLAN FOR IT WE CAN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OR MULTIPLE YEARS IF WE NEED. TO AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS -- I WOULD I WOULD CITE THE FEDERAL INTERSTATE HIGHWAY PROGRAM IS BEING ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES FOR HOW TO DO A SYSTEM LIKE THIS AND THAT IS. THEY HAVE AN OVERALL VIEW OF WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO THEY HAD A FUNDING MECHANISM THAT THEY COULD RELY ON FROM YEAR TO YEAR THEY HAD TO ADJUST SCOPE TO FUNDING FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT THEY HAD A FUNDING WRECKED MECHANISM THAT THEY COULD RELY ON SO PEOPLE THE MANAGERS COULD HIRE PEOPLE THAT CAN TRAIN THEM. THEY COULD MAKE COMMITMENTS TO CONTRACTS THEY COULD LIVE UP TO THOSE CONTRACTS THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM EVERY OTHER YEAR WHEN THEY WERE. WERE RUNNING UP AGAINST A HARD BUDGET CONSTRAINT THAT IS NO WAY TO MANAGER PROJECT. SO -- WHICH OF THE ALTERNATIVES I SUGGESTED I THINK DEPENDS ON WHICH JERRY WANT TO HIDE BEHIND BUT BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SOME STABLE SOURCE AND PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING SO THAT THE PROJECT CAN BE MANAGED RESPONSIBLY. IS IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL. I LIKE THIS STATE ORDER QUESTION -- OF DO YOU SEE PROGRESS -- ARE YOU SATISFIED THE PROGRESS IN COMPLETING -- THE RESPONSE TO YOUR AUDIT AND ARE THE PROCEEDING -- DILIGENTLY AND RESPONDING TO THE CONCERNS -- AND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN YOUR AUDIT. SO MR TRAIL OF FEEL THAT -- YES THE THIRTIES BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY COMMUNICATIVE WITH US LEADING UP TO THE SIXTY DAY PERIOD AND ACTUALLY AND SINCE THAT TIME. AS WE AGREE TO BEING IN A YOU KNOW HAVING A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION APPROACHING THE SIX MONTH MARK. AS I SAID. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS TO SHOW -- THAT THEY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED TEN OF SEVENTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS ALREADY THEY EXPRESSED REPEATEDLY AN INTENTION TO GET AS MANY OF THOSE THAT -- RECOMMENDATIONS FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTED BY THE SIX MONTH MARK AS POSSIBLE. NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE THE RECOMMENDATION RE REGARDING REPORTING TO TO YOU THE LEGISLATURE -- THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US. ON A ONE ON ONE ON ONE AND WITH OTHERS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL METHODOLOGY USE THERE. OUGHT TO ENSURE THAT IT IS USEFUL AS POSSIBLE TO THE POLICY MAKERS AND TO THE PUBLIC SO YES THAT THERE'S BEEN A HIGH LEVEL OF COMMITMENT FROM THEM AND AND WELL THAT'S BEEN. ENCOURAGING AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- NOT LA -- QUESTIONS FOR YOU WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING OUT. FOR THIS PROJECT IN YOUR OPINION AND YOU -- HOW HOW WHEN YOU REVIEW THE -- THE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT -- IS BEING JEOPARDIZED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. DO YOU SEE ANY AVENUES. FOR OF MAKING SURE THAT -- JUST ON A LOGICAL BASIS -- THAT WE MEET HE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO OF RETAIN THAT THOSE FUNDS -- THAT SEEM TO BE IN JEOPARDY. OUR N. IN ON TALK I I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO ADD A SHIP QUESTION FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT. BUT A RATIONAL STAFFS EMPLOYED OKAY. DO WE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IS IT. THE PROCESS NORMALLY. TO TO SIT DOWN AND WORK OUT THE THESE KINDS OF THINGS -- AND HOW HOW. HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS IN THOSE GRANT AGREEMENTS? SO -- WITH REGARD TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION IT SEEMS LIKE ALL THE OPTION SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF PROCEEDING -- AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED -- BY OTHERS I'D BE THE GOVERNOR'S SERVED IDEA FOR EXAMPLE GOING FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY AN OPTION THAT WOULD CONNECT TO THE A STRAIN TO POTENTIALLY BECAUSE THE ACE -- CURRENT DAYS TRAIN IS EXPECTED TO EXTENDED SERVICE TO MERCED SO THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONNECTIVITY OF IT WOULD ALSO PROBABLY BE KIND OF WITHIN THE RANGE OF OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THAT. IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT AND THEN CONNECTING DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD WOULD CONNECT TO ANOTHER -- KIND POPULATION CENTER SO THAT'S WHAT CERTAINLY ONE OPTION IS CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY OPTION -- THE PART AT THE STATE COULD -- STOP AFTER THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT AND WE COULD TIE IN TO THE TO THE EXISTING SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE THAT'S ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT THE PEER REVIEW GROUP I MENTIONED -- ADDITIONALLY YOU COULD TAKE ONE OF THOSE I MEAN YOU COULD JUST EXTEND UP DIDN'T MERCED OR JUST DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD -- YOU COULD DO MORE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BAY AREA OR IN THE LA AREA -- I MEAN THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST YOU COULD IMPROVE SERVICE SACRAMENTO -- SO I THINK THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY SHOULD CONSIDER-- IT DOES SEEM LIKE. WE WILL HAVE HOPEFULLY MORE INFORMATION IN MAY FOR THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR OF PROVIDING INFORMATION ON RIDERSHIP ON THROUGH FEASIBILITY -- ISSUES OF FOR SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND SO I THINK OUR HOPE IS THAT THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED IN MAY WILL HELP INFORM THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION ABOUT WHICH OF THESE OPTIONS TO PURSUE. ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE A POLICY CHOICE THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIVE COST OF THOSE -- AND THERE'S YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN COST TO THERE AS WELL AS THE MOBILITY BENEFITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND AND OTHER KINDS OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS. OF FOR THESE IT PRIDE IF YOU KNOW THIS PROJECT VERSES YOU KNOW WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF THESE BUTTONS -- WHAT ARE THE OTHER KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS I THINK -- MISTER THOMPSON'S COMMENT TO ABOUT HOW THIS FITS IN WITH THE THE STATE'S LARGER WELL PLANS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE SO I THINK ALL THOSE THINGS -- SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PROBABLY NONE OF THESE OPTIONS SHOULD BE OFF THE TABLE -- IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE WE PROBABLY JUST NEED TO SORT OF STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT -- GOING FORWARD WHICH ONE MEET THE STATE'S NEEDS THE PAST IN WHICH ONE MATCHES UP BEST WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR THOSE FUNDS -- WITH REGARD TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT THE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION OF THE AUTHORITY DID PROVIDE A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE UPPER BOTTLES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. A LETTER AND REALLY -- KIND OF OUTLINED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE HAS DONE -- SO I THINK THAT IT SEEMS THAT THEY PROVIDED A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT SEEM TO BE COUNTER TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAD ARGUED AND AT LEAST I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT IT SEEMED LIKE THEY MADE SOME SOME PRETTY -- PRETTY STRONG ARGUMENTS ON THAT POINT OF COURSE THERE IS SOME -- THE WAY THAT THE GRANT AGREEMENT IS WRITTEN PROVIDE SOME KIND OF GRAY AREA WHAT IS REASONABLE PROGRESS I'M AGAIN NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT IT SEEMS LIKE REASONABLE MINDS CAN DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES REASONABLE PROGRESS AND SO. SOME OF IT MAY ULTIMATELY BE -- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY MAY ULTIMATELY BE LITIGATED IF ULTIMATELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES. TO CONTINUE FORWARD WITH THAT PATH AND THEN IT WOULD BE -- ANNA HE WOULD BE A CHALLENGER -- HE WOULD COULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE STATE HAS ON AT THE AUTHORITY HAS HAS PUT TOGETHER A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE REBUTTAL. TO THOSE ARGUMENTS -- IN TERMS OF THE THE STATUS OF THAT -- JUST BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE PERHAPS SOME OF YOU CAN COMMENT -- WHEN THERE'S? THESE KIND OF MAYBE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT. THE GRANT CONDITIONS. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THE SIT DOWN WORK COME OUT. AND THEN THEY HAVE A A LIKED OUT FIRST BEFORE. THERE'S SOME KIND OF CONCLUSION -- A KIND OF APPROACH WHERE THEY JUST SAY THE GRANTS GOING TO BE CANCELLED -- I THINK THAT PART OF THE DISCUSSION IS KIND OF MISSING HERE -- AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION OF HOW. IT CLOSE THE SEEM TO BE OR THERE'S THE YOU THINK IT'S WHERE THE ISSUES THAT YOU FELT. OR PERHAPS THE OTHER PANELISTS FELT THE COULD BE WORKED OUT IF THERE WAS A STRONGER ATTEMPT TO DO SO. I DON'T KNOW -- MAYBE YOU CAN COMMERCE HELLO. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ROLE FAX PLAYED IN THIS DECISION AND WE DON'T WANT TO CONSIDER THAT BUT THAT THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE POLITICAL SCENE THERE IS THERE IS HEART TALKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU DO GRANTS FOR A TRANSIT PROJECT? YOU KNOW LIKE IT WHETHER IT'S LA OR DETROIT OR NEW YORK WHEN THEY HAVE. SERVE A DIFFERENCE ON THE PROJECT -- CONDITIONS OF THE GRANT. USUALLY THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME WERE. THERE'S A DISCUSSION TO WORK OUT -- THOSE DIFFERENCES AND PEOPLE ARE GIVEN TIME AND I'VE TALKED TO MANY PEOPLE. ABOUT THIS OF GONE THROUGH THE GRANTS PROCESS. AND I THINK THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHERE THERE'S THIS. DISCUSSION THAT TAKES PLACE IS MISSING. HERE SO I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WNTS. TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT. A SETTLEMENT AS POSSIBLE. I DON'T I DON'T DOUBT THAT I WANTED IN ONE PIECE OF EMPHASISED -- OF WHAT -- THIS KIRSTEIN SAID [inaudible] OPTIONS. LET ME URGE YOU TO ASK FOR OPTIONS IN WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU GET IN THE PAST YOU'VE TENDED TO GET A RECOMMENDATION OR THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO. WITHOUT KNOWING WILL WATER MY CHOICES WHAT ELSE COULD I DO AN HOUR LATER A YEAR AGO. WE TRIED TO LAY OUT FOR OPTIONS THOSE WERE NOT MEANT TO BE THE ONLY OPTIONS BUT THEY WERE MEANT TO REPRESENT THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE CHOICES. AND WHATEVER YOU CONSIDER IN THE FUTURE. I URGE YOU TO ASK FOR ONE OF MY CHOICES NOT WITH IS JUST ONE RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE GRANT SUIT. I FIGURE PROJECTS LIKE THE BOSTON. TRANSIT PROJECT IN YORK SUBWAY PROJECT THE SEATTLE PROJECT. I CAN GO ON AND ON AND ON WHERE THERE WAS PROBLEMS WITH THE PROJECTS. LOT OF PROBLEMS [inaudible] BUT IN EACH CASE THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AND THERE WAS A PROCESS. TO TRY TO RESOLVE. THE GRANTS -- CONDITIONS AND WORK OUT A SOLUTION LIKE THAT AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT NOT MUCH ELSE TO ADD BEYOND WHAT WAS YOUR TIMES IMAGE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HE'S HE'S CORRECT IN HIS. ASSESSMENT -- IN MANY WAYS I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT PERHAPS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD IT'S COULD CERTAINLY COME TO AGREE WITH THAT I THINK THAT ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED WERE NOT UNUSUAL ISSUES FOR PROJECTS -- YES THE PROJECT'S BEEN DELAYED SOMEWHAT. PROJECTS ARE DELAYED -- YOU KNOW THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- CERTAINLY THE PROJECT MADE PROGRESS A LONG LIST OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN DELAYED I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY YEAH VERY TRUE AND AND SO IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE. THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY ISSUES THAT COULDN'T BE OVERCOME IF THERE WAS -- AN INTEREST -- BUT BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY HAS TO BE AN INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- OTHERWISE IF THEY IF THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD -- NEAR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE AUTHORITY IS PREPARED. TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IF THEY IF THEY IF THEY ARE IF THEY END UP -- TRYING TO TAKE BACK THOSE FUNDS THAT THE STATE FEELS A WE WE A HAVE A CLAIM. TO THERE'S A MOVIE THAT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO RECONCILE. ON THOSE GRANTS AND TRY TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THAT MONEY -- I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN YOUR ARCHER THE GRAND CELEBRATION COMMITTEE OF THE THAT THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. SITTING WAS THE CENTER DODD AND OTHERS -- WE ALWAYS TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT -- IF THERE IS SOME SCHEDULE CHANGES ARE SOME ISSUES THAT HAD TO BE DEALT WITH. THAT WE WOULD SIT DOWN TO RESOLVE THEM. AND TAKE THE PROJECT MOVING ALONG SO WE CAN COMPLETE THE PROJECT. AND MAYBE EVEN CATCH UP AND IF THE PROJECT ON TIME AND ON BUDGET -- AND WE HAVE DONE THAT MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA -- IT SEEMS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT ATTITUDE HERE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN MY OPINION. AND WE ARE BOTH NEED TO HAVE THAT -- TOO SO WE CAN. GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AND FIGURE OUT HOW. TO SOLVE RESOLVE THIS IT WOULD. I JUST ANOTHER. COMMENT AS LOOKING AT THE PICTURE OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT COMES TO CALIFORNIA WE DON'T REALLY GET OUR FAIR SHARE ACCORDING TO THE FORMULAS. OF TAXES THAT'S NEVER. BEEN TRUE THAT CALIFORNIA'S GUN IT'S FOR SURE BASED ON THE FORMULA ALLOCATIONS. BUT WE ALWAYS MADE UP A LITTLE BIT OF THAT DEFICIT. BY GETTING GRANTS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AND SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THE NAT. WOULD BE CLOSE TO GETTING YOU KNOW THE IT NEVER. EXCEEDED BUT CLOSE TO GETTING -- OVER A LONG RANGE FOR THE TIME THE AMOUNT OF TAXES THAT CALIFORNIANS THE IN TWO OF THE FEDERAL TRANSIT FUNDS. WE NEVER REALLY RETRIEVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OVER TIME BUT JUST. TO BY GETTING GRANTS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS -- ONE WE MANAGED -- TO GET CLOSER TO THE pHAD A 100% WE MIGHT A FEW YEARS BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IN A BIG. BIGGER PICTURE FOR GOVERNOR IN THOUGH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. EVEN OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SHOULD BE. ADVANCING THE PRINCIPLE THAT CALIFORNIA FIGURES FOR SURE OF THE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS. AND NOT LOSE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS IT'S IS -- IT'S NOT FAIR TO OUR TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. TO PAY TAXES IN AND NOT. HAVE SOME PROJECT. FUNDING TAKEN AWAY WITHOUT. THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION. AND NOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. NOW FOR CAKE CENTER WHAT CALZAGHE'S ARE RUBIO AS ALWAYS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS. SHOULD OF THIS THREAT OF LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS COME TO PASS. WHAT OPTIONS WITH WE HAVE A COVER THAT? OR WITH THE LA OF PINE. CERTAINLY SO -- SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE NEEDED -- TO TO COVER THAT GAP AND THAT COULD BE THE GENERAL FUND -- IT COULD BE EXISTING TAX REVENUES IT COULD BE NEW TAXES -- OR OTHER KINDS OF FUND SOURCES SUCH AS THAT I MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE INVESTORS BUT I THINK IT'S WAS REFERENCED -- AT THIS POINT THOSE -- THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES HAVE NOT A MERGED AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WINNER IF THEY THEY WELL AND SO -- PARTICULARLY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COMPONENTS SO IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW FIND SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAM AND WHETHER THAT BE THE GENERAL FUND OR SOME ADDITIONAL NEW. TAXES. A SO RUBIO THANK YOU. NOT A LOT OF PERMISSION AHEAD COMING OUR WAY BUT I JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO I BELIEVE MISS. CHRISTIAN STATED EARLIER I BELIEVE YOU SAID ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE COST. NOT BELIEVE YOU STATED ALO THAT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THE HIGHER AND AND I THOUGHT I HEARD MISTER THOMPSON SUGGESTS THAT WE NEEDED. TO WELL MAYBE THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WOULD BE TO SLOW DOWN AND TAKE OUR TIME I'M JUST WONDERING IN TERMS OF JUST ANY GENERAL PROJECT. THE LONGER WE WAIT THEN YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT -- FOR THE HIGH COST OF MATERIALS LABOR. I JUST WONDER HOW DO WE RECONCILED THE BOTH WAITING FOR THE PROJECT AND THEN THE HIGH COSTS HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT I'M JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS TO SEE IF YOU'RE. TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT. WELL IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE. OF THEIRS IS SITTING IN CONSTRUCTION YOU WANT IT BAD YOU GET IT BAD. AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BALANCE BETWEEN BEING PREPARED AND HAVING EVERYTHING ORGANIZED IN AWARDING CONTRACTS OF THE RIGHT SIZE AND HAVING THE RIGHT MANAGER YOU'LL CAPABILITY. AND THE EXPOSURE YOU HAVE DO INFLATION. THIS YEAR EVERY YEAR OF INFLATION THIS PROJECT IS EXPOSED TO IS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS BUT AS FOR THE COST OF THE PROJECT ROUGHLY. WHICH TELLS YOU SOMETHING ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT BUT BUT NO IT'S A BALANCE YOU DON'T WANT TO RUSH IN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO GO OFF BEFORE YOU'RE PREPARED TO GO YOU DON'T WANT. TO TO GET PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE AS I SAID BUT AT THE SAME TIME IDEALLY YOU'D LIKE TO GET IT THE PROJECT DONE IN A REASONABLE PLAN THE MANAGEABLE WAY. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOING TOO FAST THERE IS SUCH A THING AS HAVING SO MUCH MONEY OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE AVAILABLE -- BUT GOOD PROJECT MANAGERS KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IF THEY KNOW WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE AND IF THEY CAN DEPEND ON THEM IF THEY CAN PLAN AROUND -- STONE SIR GALGIANI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- YOU KNOW THE THE CARD BACKS ARE ARE CERTAINLY CONCERNED A NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A CERTAINLY A CONCERN AND AND ONE THING MISTER HERMAN I'VE I'VE I'VE MENTIONED AND IN THE PAST TWO YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THAT WE NEED -- TO BE A LITTLE BIT KINDLER AND GENTLER TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT -- TO LAWSUITS ARE FILED AGAINST FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE ATTORNEY GENERAL FILES LAWSUITS ABOUT ONCE A WEEK. AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS EXTREMELY STRAINED AND I DON'T THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THAT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO BE ANY BETTER -- SENSITIVE -- TO HELP BEING AS BILL OUT OF A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN. FRANKLY MISMANAGED -- AND AND AND NOT PLANNED WELL AND SO -- THE MESSAGE I GOT FROM OUR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS IS THAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT GOING TO COME TO FRUITION ANYTIME SOON. AND IS A GIGANTIC PROJECT AND WHILE I UNDERSTAND HIS NEED TO COMPLETE A SEGMENT BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD MERCED TO PRESERVE WHAT FEDERAL FUNDING IS COMING THAT PROBABLY WAS PROBABLY A WISE ALTERNATIVE IN A WISE RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] FOR HIM. I'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD -- EVEN BEFORE I CAME IN THE LEGISLATURE WHY WE START A SEGMENT FROM BAKERSFIELD NORTH -- TO RESET AND THEN THE SAN FRANCISCO INSTEAD OF STARTING IN A MORE POPULATED AREA LIKE MAYBE GOING FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- SOUTH FOR LOS ANGELES SOUTH THE ANAHEIM. BECAUSE MAYBE THE AUDITOR IN THE ALLEY -- CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT THAT IF WE BUILT THOSE SEGMENTS. THE ACTUARIAL COST OF A TICKET. BUT PROBABLY HAVE A LOT LESS. THAN WITH THE ACTUARIAL COSTS ARE GOING TO BE IF WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD IMMERSE THAT. KNOWS WANTING IF YOU'VE DONE ANY ANALYSIS ON THAT AT ALL SO WITH THOSE ACTUARIAL COSTS WILL BE. TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT AS CLOSE TO A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS NOW. BUT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT OKAY IF WE INCREASE WE INVEST THAT KIND OF MONEY WHAT IS THE ACTUARIAL COST IS GONNA BE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE STATE TO BREAK EVEN. TO GO FROM LOS ANGELES TO SACRAMENTO VERSUS GETTING ON A FLIGHT FOR SIXTY NINE DOLLARS -- OR TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS AT THE STATE PAYS FOR US THEY PAY FULL PRICE FOR THE PRO FOR THOSE TICKETS -- OBVIOUSLY THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF THESE TICKETS WHICH IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR GOVERNMENTS TO SUBSIDIZE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS DONE. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S DONE THROUGHOUT EUROPE -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR OPINION ON THOSE. WE HAVEN'T DONE IN AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED PERHAPS -- AS IT AS IT NAM SUBSIDY TO OPERATE THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS -- AND HOPEFULLY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND IN MAY WILL PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL RIDERSHIP DATA THAT'LL HELP UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT THOSE -- WHAT THOSE WOULD BE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST IS THAT FROM THE DECISIONS TO START A CENTRAL VALLEY -- WERE RELATED TO THE SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND AND TRYING TO MEET THOSE -- AND I AND THE STATE TOOK A NUMBER OF STEPS AS WAS REFERENCED I TO TRY TO MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS -- IN ADDITION I THINK THERE WAS SOME THOUGHT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THAT WOULD BE -- PERHAPS A MORE DURABLE SEGMENT ON SOME OF THAT THE SEGMENTS. FIVE FOR EXAMPLE I'M IN THE LA AREA AS WELL AS IN THE BAY AREA REQUIRE TUNNELING AND SOME MORE DIFFICULT -- KINDS OF ENGINEERING WORK THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE MORE CHALLENGING THAN. THE RELATIVELY FLAT CONSTRUCTION IN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO I THINK THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT WENT INTO THE DECISION TO START THEIR PROBABLY THE ABILITY OPERATE WITHOUT A SUBSIDY -- YET AS A STANDALONE-SEGMENT WAS NOT WAS NOT THE READ THE MAIN REASON -- BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THAT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH THAT CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT THEN. PERHAPS A SEGMENT THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE MORE RIDERSHIP YEAH THAT THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO BE ONE OF MY CONCERNS THAT -- WITH IF WE WERE TO GET THIS THING BUILT ON THE ACTUAL COST OF THE TICKET IS GOING TO BE -- ASTRONOMICAL -- AND THEN BUT I I STILL BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE pPROJECT I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR WE SHOULD BE BREAKING IT UP INTO SEGMENTS MAKING MAYBE THREE OR FOUR SECONDS FIVE SEGMENTS AND BUILDING IT AS WE CAN AFFORD TO BUILD AND CERTAINLY PRESERVE. FROM THE FUNDING WE'RE WE CERTAINLY CAN BUT I WOULD JUST GET -- CAUTION THE THE THE STATE TO STOP KICKING PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE GROWING EVERY TIME YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO LET'S TRY TO WORK WITH HIM. AND MAYBE MISTER CHAIRMAN WE GET A SUBCOMMITTEE OF SOME REPUBLICANS ALBEIT WERE A MINORITY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE THE KEY. TO GETTING INTO THE WHITE HOUSE IF WE NEED TO GET IN THERE AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALL WANT. GOOD THINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK COOPERATIVELY TOGETHER TO GET WHAT WE NEED. TO TO BUILD A FIRST CLASS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I I WELCOME THAT OPPORTUNITY -- JUST RESPOND TO MR CENTER STONE -- THOUGHTS ON THERE ARE -- OF COURSE. SIR WORK HOURS CAN I COME FROM THE GREAT MENTOR THAT WE HAD -- ON ON EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO GERMANS -- WERE MENTORED. BY -- CONGRESSMAN AND THEN SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION NORMAN MINETA. AND NORMAN MINETA THIS STYLE WAS. TO WORK ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WITH THE THE MINORITY -- A MEMBER IN THE PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE -- WORK WITH THE MEMBER ON WAS ACCEPTABLE IN TERMS OF A MAJOR PROPOSAL. AND HE OFTEN GOT OVER FOUR HUNDRED VOTES FOR HIS -- ICED TEA SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BILLS. OUR HE WENT AND VISITED EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT -- BY THE WAY I DO THAT IS YOU KNOW. AND I TAKE HIS -- STYLE LEADERSHIP -- AND I THINK -- PERHAPS WE NEED -- TO GET HIS ADVICE AS A CALIFORNIA THE NOSE WASHINGTON. I WOULD SAY THAT -- AND I CERTAINLY REACH OUT TO THEM. TO GET IS A VICE. BECAUSE HE SERVED DOES SO. A SECRETARY IN THE CABINET -- FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THEN PRESIDENT -- BUSH OF MADE HIM THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION FOR UNITED STATES [inaudible] SO -- HE WOULD BE A GUIDE A YOU KNOW GET SOME ADVICE FOM ABOUT THIS EXACT SUBJECT SO CENTER GALGIANI -- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY FOR EVERYONE THAT THE FRA HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS PARTNERS WITH CALIFORNIA I AUTHORED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOND AND I WAS BACK IN DC SINCE SHORTLY AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD MADE A COMMITMENT TO HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDING. FOR THE NATION AND THE FRA HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING US TO ACHIEVE MANY OF OUR GOALS THEY'VE BEEN FLEXIBLE WITH US WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE DOLLARS. NOBODY IN THE NATION NEW HOW TO BUILD A SYSTEM THERE IS NO BLUEPRINT WE'VE NEVER BUILT ONE BEFORE. AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ALONG WITH SOME OF OUR IMHO YOU PARTNERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WORKED WITH THE F.. THE F. R. A. SOUGHT REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FROM THESE OTHER -- COUNTRIES LIKE FRANCE SNCF FROM FRANCE SUBMITTED A COPY THAT I HAVE TO THIS DAY AND SO I JUST WANT TO CLEAR UP FOR ANYBODY THAT HAS DOUBTS THE FRA HAS WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY WITH US. I THINK THERE WAS SOME GREAT MISCOMMUNICATION -- IN JANUARY AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL REACH SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION -- SECONDLY TO SPEAK TO SENATOR STONES -- COMMENTS I WILL TELL YOU WHY WE STARTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY PLACE IN THE ENTIRE NATION AT THAT TIME THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO REACH THE SPEEDS OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR. AND THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE AT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR THAT'S THE LEVEL AT WHICH HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY TO AIRLINE TRAFFIC. AND OR AIRLINE TRAVEL AND THEREFORE. GENERATE A PROFIT THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND LATER HAD TO SAY AND ALSO THE GRANTS ARE FOR HIGHER SPEED RAIL BECAUSE IT CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY THE ONLY STATE THAT COULD COMPETE. AND AGAIN I REPEAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO DO THAT. SECOND REASON FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE NEEDED A TEST TRACK TO TEST THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS. WE NEEDED A HUNDRED MILES AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AGAIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS THE ONLY PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THIRD THE REQUIREMENT WAS TO HAVE INDEPENDENT UTILITY AND THAT'S IN THE EVENT THAT THERE WAS MONEY BUT THE ECONOMY CHANGED FUNDING CHANGED. THE PRESIDENT AT ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILT IT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT BACK AGAIN WITH A PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE SUCH AS BNSF OR THE U. P. LINE. AND SO WHEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WAS PROMISED MONEY NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA BUT WE ACHIEVED MONEY FROM OTHER STATES. THAT WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR PROJECTS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WHATEVER WE BUILT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD CONNECT BACK INTO THE BNSF LINE. AND WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TWO DAYS IF WE DID NOTHING MORE TODAY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE STILL COULD CONNECT INTO THE B. AND A SEVEN AMTRAK. OF CORRIDOR WITH DIRECTLY WITH AMTRAK. ONCE WE GET UP TO MERCED WHICH IS JUST ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE MILES AS THE GOVERNOR IS WISHING TO DO. TO DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE PASSENGERS COMMUTE FROM BAKERSFIELD. CONNECTED MERCED WITH AMTRAK UP TO SACRAMENTO AS THE FIRST LEG OF THE STOOL THE SECOND LEG OF THE STOOL WOULD BE CONNECTING AT MERCED INTO OAKLAND WHICH AGAIN IT DOES TODAY. AND ONCE WE FINISH THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACE DOWN TO MERCED WHICH THIS BODY HAS APPROVED FUNDING FOR THAT WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL. YOU MENTIONED THE COST OF TICKETS DANNY DO TAE -- GOD REST HIS SOUL HE WAS A TREMENDOUS PARTNER AT WITH CALIFORNIA BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY AND HE WAS WITH THE SNCF COMPANY OUT OF FRANCE SOME OF YOU BEEN WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED FOR A LONG TIME WILL REMEMBER HIM. AND HE TALKED TO US ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE THE COST OF THE TICKET AND THE LEGISLATIVE BODY NEEDS TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER IT'S IF. WE INTEND TO MAKE A PROFIT FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL TO BILL TO PUT BACK IN THE SYSTEM AND BUILD MORE OR IF WE INTEND TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. AT THE TIME IT WAS BELIEVED THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL TICKETS WOULD COST ABOUT HALF OF WHAT AN AIRLINE TICKET WOULD BE. BUT THAT COULD GO LOWER OR HIGHER DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE WANTED TO HAVE THE INFLUENCE THE END. TO EMPHASIZE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT PORTION OR EMPHASIZE THE PROFIT PORTION -- IN NEXT I WANTED -- TO ADDRESS MISTER LOU THOMPSON -- EARLY ON WHEN WE HAD THE MY VISION FOR THE PERIOD VIEW COMMITTEE THAT I PLACED IN AB THREE OH THREE FOUR WAS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE WHO HAD. INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IT WAS VERY EXPLICIT THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE MEMBERS WOULD BE WOULD HAVE THAT BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE. AND PART OF THAT THOUGHT PROCESS WAS BECAUSE AT THE TIME CALIFORNIA'S HIGHS ROLE FORTY DID HAVE EMOJIS WITH JAPAN GERMANY FRANCE. ITALY CHINA -- AND I AND OTHERS -- SOUTH KOREA I BELIEVE AND THEY WERE VERY ACTIVE AND VERY INTERESTED IN CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AT THE TIME WHAT THEN HAPPENED BECAUSE WE HAD MONEY. IS THAT COMPANIES THAT DID HAVE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EXPERIENCE IN BUILDING STRUCTURES WERE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACTS AND SO THEN IT WAS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE FOR THE SAME INDIVIDUALS TO BE MEMBERS OF THE PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE. AND I REMEMBER BEING -- APPRECIATIVE OF THE MEMBERS WHO WERE WILLING TO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE BUT AT THE SAME TIME DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T ND UP HAVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD THIS INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE. WITH ACTUALLY BUILDING SYSTEMS I THINK THAT -- WHERE THE TIME NOW WHERE WERE WE WE HAVE A CAN SEIZE ON THE PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE [inaudible] CORRECT. YES AND THE CONTRACTS HAVE NOW BEEN LET. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION -- PROJECT ONE TWO THREE FOUR AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT WHO AND WHO WE CAN ADD TO THE PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE WHO DOES IN FACT HAVE SOME OF THIS EXPERIENCE. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE AN OPERATOR THAT WE BROUGHT ON BOARD THAT DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE I THINK IT'S TIME FOR THE FORTY TO TAKE A LOOK AGAIN AS WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE DID THE BUSINESS PLAN. AND WE HAD WE ASKED RESPONDENTS TO PARTICIPATE AND REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST WHERE THEY WOULD. COMMENT ON CALIFORNIA'S -- HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT THEY WOULD COMMENT WHETHER WAS DOABLE WHETHER MATCH THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AND EXPRESSLY -- WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE THESE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES? BE INTERESTED IN MAKING INVESTMENTS AND CALIFORNIA'S PROJECT I THINK WE ARE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHERE WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE A STRONG EMPHASIS. ON THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN HERE TO FOUR IS. A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN PASSENGER RAIL COMMUTER RAIL -- CALTRANS TYPE PROJECTS THOSE ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT THAN A LARGE MULTI BILLIONDOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO FOCUSING ON THE SAME THINGS THAT WE FOCUSED ON WHEN WE WERE ASKING OTHERS -- TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR COMMENT ON THAT [inaudible] WELL. COMMENT IS THAT IT HAS BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PEOPLE WITH INTERNATIONAL HIGH SPEED RAIL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING FOR CONTRACTORS TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. SO TIME AFTER TIME WE FOUND PEOPLE BUT THEY'VE BEEN CONFLICTED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER -- IN FACT THOUGH WHAT THE PROJECT IS RIGHT NOW IS NOT SO MUCH OF RAIL PROJECT AS IT IS A VERY STRAIGHT HIGHWAY PROJECT. AND WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE WITH CALTRANS EXPERIENCE WHO I THINK ARE VERY WELL SET UP TO ADVISE US ON THAT PART OF THE PROJECT -- HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE WE WILL FIND PEOPLE WITH THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE YEAR MENTIONING. BUT AS OF NOW I SUPPOSE I'M THE ONLY ONE ON THE COMMITTEE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN A HIGH SPEED RAIL AND ALL OF ITS ASPECTS AS WELL AS THE ENGINEERING AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. WHAT I HAVE FOCUSED ON IS ALSO TRYING TO GET PEOPLE WITH ECONOMIC EXPERTISE BECAUSE? THAT'S REALLY WHY WE'RE BUILDING THE PROJECT IT'S NOT AN ENGINEERING PROJECT AS A BUSINESS THE WHOLE PEOPLE AROUND. AND I HOPEFULLY WE HAVE -- EXPERTISE TO ANALYZE THE PLANS FOR THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW [inaudible] HI I NEW GUINEA DO TEAM DO TAE VERY WELL AND I AM VERY WELL FAMILIAR WITH THE FRENCH EXPERIENCE IN -- CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THEY'VE MADE. AND THEY CERTAINLY DID. OUR AND MATT BRINGS UP AS WE LOOK AS WE GO IN THE FUTURE HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE SOME WAY TO GET THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE. ESPECIALLY THE EXPERTISE OF THE EARLIER OPERATOR FROM THE AUTHORITY INTO THE FORMULATION OF THE OPTIONS IN THE PLANS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE. THE F. R. A. HAD ISSUE THEIR OWN REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN HAD RECEIVED -- INPUT FROM MANY COUNTRIES AT THE TIME AND I I DO KNOW THAT THAT SO MANY ARE WORKING ON THE PROJECT THAT IT CONFLICTS AMOUNT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE ASKING OUR FRA PARTNERS -- TO WORK WITH US TO SOLICIT ONCE AGAIN. OUR REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FROM THOSE WHO ARE IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHO ARE WATCHING. THIS SYSTEM AND WHO HAVE THE ABILTY TO COMMENT ON AND PERHAPS THAT SOMETHING OUR OUR NEW OPERATOR CAN HELP US WITH. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. THE FIRST STUDY DID THE FRA DID OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA WAS ONE THAT I SEPARATE SUPERVISED AT THE F. OR A IN SEVERAL OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE UNITED STATES AT THE OFFER A HAS DONE. HI SUPERVISOR WAS INVOLVED ALL. IT AGAIN THE PROBLEM WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE UNITED STATES IS THAT PEOPLE SEE A PICTURE OF MOUNT FUJI ON ON THEY THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THAT AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT ARE THE ISSUES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. SO WHILE ARE YOU CERTAINLY VALUED INTERNATIONAL EXPERTISE -- EXPERTISE IN US CONSTRUCTION ISSUES EXPERTISE IN U. S. DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES US DEMAND MODELING. OF THOSE ARE IN SOME WAYS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOUR WITH YOUR POSITION THAT WE NEED. MORE INTERNATIONAL EXPERTISE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BUTTRESS THAT WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT AMERICAN CONDITIONS ARE. WHAT AMERICAN DEMAND AND AND RESPONSE CONDITIONS ARE? THANK YOU. THANK YOU KAT OF CIRCLE JOHNNY OH OKAY WELL THANKS I LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL -- PERHAPS AT THE PROPER TIME THE LA -- COULD. SUMMARIZE SOME VARIOUS OPTIONS. THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. TERMS OF AN INDEPENDENT LOOK AT THE HALF. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL CALL THE NEXT PANEL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THEMSELVES -- WE HAVE -- THE WHO'S ON A PANELIST ON LANNY. AREAS OKAY SIR I WAS WONDERING. AND BRIAN ILLNESS OR SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION [inaudible] AND JOE HEDGES CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER -- ROSS FONG AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER PAM IS THE IS A COMMA A JETER FOR THE OFFICERS. SO WILL TURN OVER -- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FIRST OF ALL -- I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE BOARD CHAIRMAN -- AND WELCOME. TO THE CALIFORNIA SENATE. YOU HAVE A FOR OKAY [inaudible] BUT AB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LENNY MENDOZA -- AS OF FEBRUARY I WAS NAMED THE BY THE GOVERNOR AS HIS CHIEF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS ADVISER AND THE pECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS AGENCY AND THEN SIX WEEKS AGO I WAS ASKED TO CHAIR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO TODAY IS? GIVE YOU SOME INTRODUCTORY REMARKS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND THEN I WILL TURN OVER TO SECRETARY AND THIS WILL GIVE A WE WILL MARCH FORWARD TO DELIVER. ON THAT VISION. THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN WOULD BE INCREDIBLE. CREDIBILITY MEANS. QUALITY OF BEING BELIEVABLE AND WORTHY OF TRUST GOOD FOR YOU IS GOING TO REESTABLISH CREDIBILITY THROUGH. AN AGGRESSIVE COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY. BY KEEPING OUR COMMITMENTS. AND DELIVERING ON HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS WHILE LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS FOR DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL IN A WAY THAT IS TRANSPARENT TRANSFORMATION. AND UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE AREA OF TRANSPARENCY. THE STORY IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO THIS MOST OBVIOUSLY THROUGH THE STAB WHICH MEANT OF A FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. WHAT PROJECTS CHALLENGES TRENDS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PUBLIC? AND OF COURSE STEPHANIE DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE. AND WE HAVE AN EFFORT NAY COMMITTEE REPORTED EVERY HIGH SPEED RAIL BOARD MEETING. I'VE ALSO ASKED MISTER RICHARD. ON THE BOARD TO PROVIDE AN UPDATED EVERY COMMITTEE MEETING AND ADDED TO THAT'S BEEN THE CASE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT. WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE FUNDING IN HAND TO DELIVER THE ENTIRE SYSTEM NOW. SO WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. BY USING BUILDING BLOCKS. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED TRANSPORTATION PROJECT UP. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PLAN LAID OUT A SET OF PRIORITIES. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT. AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS STATEWIDE. NUMBER WILL ADD TRACK AND SYSTEMS AND EXTEND THE SEGMENT FROM JUST AN ALMOND ORCHARD JUST NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD INTO DOWNTOWN. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN PROMISED TO EXPLORE REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MARK EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR ON EARLY SERVICE OPTION. AN UPDATE THE COST FIGURES OUT TO REVIEW BY THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR. AND SUBJECTING THE BUSINESS PLAN. NUMBERS TO FURTHER RESTRICT. THE PLAN COMMITTED TO INVEST. THE REMAINING BOOK IN FUNDS AND PURSUE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FINANCE A COMPLETE THE SYSTEM. INDEED THE PROJECT UP REPORT UPDATE REPORT WILL INCLUDE THIS CONTENT IN OUR MESA MIDDLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE A FULL ANALYSIS AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR BEST EARLY OPTION. BEST EARLY SERVICE OPTION. THE GOVERNOR ASKED. FORTY TO DO MORE IN THIS AREA OF TRANSPARENCY AND WE ARE. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION WE'VE ESTABLISHED A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PAGE ON THE WEBSITE. BUDGET CHANGE ORDERS CAN BE FOUND FOR EACH CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. AS OF TODAY. THE PACKAGE INCLUDES THE HUNDREDS OF CHANGE ORDERS EXECUTED TO DATE. AND THE SITE WILL BE UPDATED QUARTERLY GOING FORWARD. ON KEEPING COMMITMENTS LET'S BE CLEAR. WE'VE COMMITTED TO FUND THE BOOK AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES AND WE'RE KEEPING THOSE COMMITMENTS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHORITY IS A FUNDING PARTNER THE CALTRAIN. ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT. THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROP ONE A FUNDS PLUS AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE AUTHORITY AS DIRECTED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ROSECRANS MARXUACH GATE GRADE SEPARATION PROJECT. NUMBER ONE ON THE PC LIST OF MOST DANGEROUS GRADE SEPARATIONS. THE REMAINING BOOK AND FUNDS ARE COMMITTED TO THE LA UNION STATION IMPROVEMENT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] MOREOVER. WE COMMITTED TO COMPLETE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES AND I'M. WE WERE DOING THAT. REQUESTED NEED ASSIGNMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STREAMLINE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND WORK IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE ARE A FUNDING. FEDERAL FUNDING AGREEMENT DEADLINE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THE AUTHORITY WAS VERY CLEAR IN ITS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT THE LESSONS THAT I LEARNED. FROM GOING INTO CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO FULLY ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES PREVENTED BY PRESENTED BY RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION. UTILITY RELOCATION. AND THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT ISSUES. WE'RE SMARTER NOW. AND COMMITTED TO NOT REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST. COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IN FRONT OF FUTURE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IS NECESSARY. TO REFINE COST ESTIMATES TO ADVANCED DESIGN. TôI JENNIFER BY AND MITIGATE RISK. TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT WORK. AND TO READY SHARED QUARTERS FOR INVESTMENTS AS FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE MOREOVER. THE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS BROUGHT IN A NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT IS FOCUSED ON PROJECT DELIVERY. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER JOE HEDGES. THE PROJECT CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN EVER BEEN ON THIS PROJECT. RISK ISSUES ARE BEING IDENTIFIED MANAGED UNMITIGATED. SECRETARY ANISE WILL DISCUSS HOW. CONSTRUCTION WILL PROGRESS THIS YEAR IS THE RESULT OF THAT HARD WORK. AS YOU KNOW THE PROJECT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE FUNDING NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROJECT. AND LET'S BE CLEAR IT NEVER HAPPENS. PROP ONE A PROVIDED ONLY 20% OF THE PROJECTS THAN ESTIMATED COSTS. TODAY WITH A STABLE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH. TWENTY TEN FEDERAL FUNDS IN THE PROP A FOUR ONE A FUNDING. IS ALREADY HAS ACCESS NOW TO JUST UNDER 30% OF THE PROJECT FUNDING COSTS. SO HOW DO WE GO ABOUT MAKING HIGH SPEED RAIL REAL IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US TODAY. FORTY IT ALREADY BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHEN THEY BROUGHT IN THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO ADVISE ON OPERATIONAL ISSUES FOR SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA. THE AUTHORITY DIRECTED THE VIDEO TO ANALYZE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AND ROOM SERVICE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. THROUGH THIS WORK. THE INDICATION IS THAT MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD. IS THE ONLY SERVICE LINE TO MAKE SENSE AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE ONLY PLACE IN THE STATE WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS COMPLETE OR NEAR COMPLETE. AND CONSTRUCTION IS WELL UNDER WAY. THE MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD LINE ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF OFFERING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILE HIGH SPEED SERVICE CONNECTING THREE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES. IN THE CENTER PART OF THE STATE WHERE I GREW UP. AND MERCED FRESNO ONE CAR SERVICE. WOULD ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS TO A SERVICE TRAVELING TO SAN JOSE. AN AMTRAK SERVICE TRAVELING TO SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND. WHILE REDUCING THE TRAVEL TIMES BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED MINUTES THROUGH THE CENTRAL OUT. ON MAY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN AUTHORITY ROLE WILL RELEASE THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. OUTLINED THE E. TIAS ANALYSIS FOR EARLY OPERATIONS. BENEFITS RISKS. COSTS AND SCHEDULES AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WITH FOUR DIFFERENT PRESENTING THAT IN MAY -- LET ME TURN IT OVER TO SECRETARY ANISE WILL PROVIDE MORE PROGRAMMATIC UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GERMAN MAN DONS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TESTIFY BRIAN AND THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. HIGH SPEED RAIL REMAINS THE ESSENTIAL BACKBONE OF A BROADER MODERNIZE RAIL AND TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE CALIFORNIANS DESERVING NEED AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO GROW TOWARD FIFTY MILLION POPULATION. THAT MODERNIZE RAIL SYSTEM WILL BE INTEGRATED. AND FOR AN INCREASING NUMBER OF TRIPS WILL BE FASTER LOWER COST AND MORE CONVENIENT. THAN A CAR OR A AIRPLANE TRIP. AND A ROBUST RAIL SYSTEM IN TRANSIT SYSTEM. IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CALIFORNIA'S MOBILITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN PROVIDES THE EXAMPLE. OF SAN JOSE TO FRESNO TRIP. THAT TRIP TAKES ABOUT THREE HOURS BY CAR WITH HIGH SPEED ROUTE WOULD TAKE ABOUT ONE HOUR. AND THERE'S A SIMILAR TRAVEL TIME SAVINGS LOOKING AT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. THE SLIDE IS UP ON THE SCREEN NOW. ADDRESSES SOME OF THE NEW STRATEGY DIRECTION AND APPLYING THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS IMPLEMENTED. COUPLE EXAMPLES. FIRST WITH THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION OF THE THIRD PARTY CAESAR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. THE RAILROAD OPERATORS -- THE CITIES IN THE REGION. AND THAT HAS BEEN AN AREA OF RISKING AND COST FOR THE PROJECT BUT THE PROJECT TEAM RIGHT NOW IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THOSE THIRD PARTIES IN SOME CASES. A REINSTITUTING THIRD PARTY MASTER AGREEMENTS OF COOPERATION. TO REDUCE RISK. HIGH SPEED ROSE ALSO INCREASING ENGAGEMENT OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES WITH THE FINAL DESIGN WORK THAT THE DESIGN BILL CONTRACTORS WORKING ON BECAUSE THAT DESIGN BUILD WORK CAN CHANGE SOME OF THOSE. THIRD PARTY REQUIREMENTS AND AND AND THAT PROJECT SCOPE SO HIGH SPEED ROSE WORKING DAY REDUCE RISK IN THAT AREA BY GOOD COORDINATION BOTH WITH THE THIRD PARTIES AND THE DESIGN BUILDERS AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR DESIGN WORK. AND IN FACT COMPLETING THE DESIGN WORK IS A BENEFIT AS WELL BECAUSE THAT REDUCES ANY RESIDUAL RISK OF RIGHT AWAY QUESTIONS ENVIRONMENTAL. WORKING SENTRA SO ALL THESE THINGS THROUGH THE PIPELINE A PROJECT DEVELOPMENT -- BE MANAGED BY JOE AND HIS TEAM. pPROJECT. IN BOTH THE TIME AND SCHEDULE. ON THE NEXT FLIGHT HERE'S MORE SPECIFICS OF SOME OF THE CHANGES IN HOW THE STAFF FOR DOING THEIR WORK. THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AND THE DEPUTY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER ARE ROUTINELY NOW IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY MEETING WITH ALL THE PARTIES. LOOKING AT SOME OF THE LEGACY ISSUES WITH TO RESOLVE THOSE -- MONITORING ISSUES AS THEY COME UP. TO RESOLVE THOSE AS WELL. THERE IS AN ONGOING EFFORT TO OPTIMIZE STAFF AT THE AUTHORITY NO SOME OF THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY HE STATE AUDITOR. ASSUME INCREASED FOCUS ON CONTRACT MANAGEMENT ADD TO THAT END IN THE SHORT TERM A HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS REDESIGNATED SOME POSITIONS THAT ARE VACANT TO CONTRACT MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL IN THE LONGER TERM APPROACH TO STAFF IN THIS AREA. AND HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS IMPLEMENTED TO GET TO WORK SCHEDULES AND PLANS. TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND MONITOR WORK AS WE GO. AND THIS NEXT SERIES OF SLIDES SHOWS DETAIL ON WHAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE IS BEING DONE AND SOME OF THE REMAINING AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO CLEAR. THE SEGMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS A CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE ONE AND THIS CHART INDICATES THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK AS OF JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. THIS SEGMENT INCLUDES MANY OF THE ICONIC STRUCTURES THAT YOU MIGHT SEE IF YOU'VE DRIVEN DOWN HIGHWAY NINETY NINE IN FRESNO RECENTLY. AS SUCH AS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER VIDAK: CAN PERGOLA THAT'S JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THAT -- THEN REALIGNED HIGHWAY NINETY NINE PROJECT. AND ALSO THE CEDAR VIADUCTS. DON THIS CHART AT THERE'S A TOTAL MILEAGE -- THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE MILE SEGMENT. ABOUT SEVEN MILES OF THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS FOR GRADING. AND THE EMBANKMENT WORK AND THEN YOU SEE -- BY THE COLORS DIFFERENT PROJECT STRUCTURES SWITCHES BRIDGES GRADE SEPARATIONS EXCEPT TRUCK -- SOME THAT ARE COMPLETED SOME THAT ARE UNDER WAY AND SOME THAT ARE STILL IN THE FUTURE. NOW THE PROJECT TEAM IS FOCUSING ON RISKS TO THIS. PARTICULAR SEGMENT AND ON ON THIS SEGMENT THIRD PARTY ISSUES WITH UTILITY RELOCATION. AND ADJACENT RAILROADS ARE ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED RISK. THE TEAM IS WORKING TO FINALIZE ISSUES WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES AND ADDITIONALLY ADDRESSING CRITICAL DESIGN NEEDS BY FORMING A FOCUS TEAM TO DRIVE COMPLETION OF DESIGNED TO ALIGN WITH THE EXISTING RIGHT AWAY ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES AGAIN. MANAGING THE RISK. AS I GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS ALSO CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. ONE BUT THE PROGRESS WE EXPECT TO MAKE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR BY DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE CHART INDICATES THAT. THE PLAN IS TO AB. BRING ADDITIONAL. SEGMENTS OF GUIDE WAY WORK AGAIN THIS IS THE THE GRADING IN THE EMBANKMENT WORK. GROWING FROM ABOUT SEVEN MILES TODAY TO EIGHTEEN MILES BY THE END OF THE YEAR. RIGHT NOW THERE ABOUT SEVEN STRUCTURES IN PROGRESS IN FOR COMPLETE BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR THE PLAN IS TO HAVE TEN STRUCTURES UNDER CONSTRUCTION WITH TEN STRUCTURES COMPLETE. THE NEXT CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE IS CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE TO THREE THE ISSUES. ON THIS SEGMENT ARE LARGELY PROCUREMENT OF THE REMAINING RIGHT AWAY. AND RESOLVING THIRD PARTY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE ISSUES. THE TEAM IS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS WORKING TO FINALIZE ISSUES WITH THE THIRD PARTIES AND BY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. THE NEXT SLIDE OR SHOW WHERE WE PLAN TO BE AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. SO COMPARING THE TWO TABLES HERE YOU SEE THAT -- WE GO FROM HAVING -- IN JANUARY. TWENTY ONE SECTIONS OF GUIDE WHERE TWENTY ONE MILES OF GUIDEWAY IN PROGRESS IN TWELVE COMPLETED TO BY THE END OF THAT. CALENDAR YEAR SHOWING A TWENTY EIGHT ARE IN PROGRESS AND THIRTY SEVEN MILES OF THE GUIDE WAY ARE COMPLETE. SEVERAL MILLION STRUCTURES THREE STRUCTURES ARE IN PROGRESS NOW BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. THE TARGET IS TO HAVE FOURTEEN IN PROGRESS IN FOR STRUCTURES COMPLETE ON THE SEGMENT. LASTLY CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE. FOR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE FOR IS THE CHALLENGES ARE LARGELY ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN A SMALL NUMBER POTENTIALLY DIFFICULT PARCELS TO ACQUIRE FOR THE RIGHT AWAY. WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES. BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR YOU'LL SEE THAT. THIS SEGMENT ANTICIPATES. THE DAHLE. MILES OF THE GUIDE WAY ARE EITHER UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR COMPLETED BY DECEMBER. AND THEN AS YOU LOOK TO STRUCTURES. OF THE TOTAL STRUCTURES OF ELEVEN I SEVEN WOULD BE IN PROGRESS BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR HAND FOR WOULD BE COMPLETED. S. IS THAT YOU ALREADY HEARD TODAY FROM THE STATE AUDITOR. WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE AUTHORITY IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE ALL OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND ON THE ESTABLISHED SCHEDULE WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT -- THE ODD THE OFFICE BELIEVES WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS IN THAT REGARD. THE AUTHORITY WELCOMED THE AUDIT. AND IS TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY ITS FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BUILT ON ISSUES THE AUTHORITY HAD IDENTIFIED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN BUT THANKS TO THE AUDIT. THAT SOME GAPS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND SOME ADDITIONAL AREAS OF PROCESS DEVELOPMENT WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED IN HIGH SPEED RAIL UNDER THE LEADERSHIP -- IT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BRIAN KELLY IS WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES. AND WILL CONTINUE TO MEET THOSE DELIVERABLES. IT'S ALSO BEEN DISCUSSION AT THE HEARING ABOUT THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION LETTER THAT CAME TO US ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH. THREATENING TO DE OBLIGATE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION IN FEDERAL GRANT FUNDS. IT IS ALSO MENTIONED AT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY RESPONDED ON MARCH FOURTH SENDING TWO LETTERS. STAY IN THE POSITION OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE PROJECT CONTINUES TO FURTHER THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE FEDERAL FUNDS WERE OBLIGATED. WE ARE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING THE GRANT REQUIREMENTS. THE LETTERS NOTED FRA IS TAKEN ACTION DETRIMENTAL TO TIMELY PROGRESS ON THE AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. AND LASTLY WE INVITE THE F. R. A. TO REESTABLISH THE VERY. FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP IN VERY PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH HAD FOR MOST OF THE GRANT CYCLE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE HAPPENS HERE WE HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YET BUT VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THEY WILL RE ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHORITY. THE AUTHORITY CERTAINLY ANXIOUS TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT THAT THEY HAVE AN BELIEVE WE CAN DO SO. I JUST QUICKLY GET A RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE STATISTICS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENNETT HE SHOULD BE THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT IN THESE WERE. DISCUSSED AT THE LAST BOARD MEETING -- THROUGH JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PROJECT SPENT ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND OF NOTE THAT. 95% OF THAT OF THOSE EXPENDITURES HAVE GONE TO CALIFORNIA FIRMS AND WORKERS. ECONOMIC IMPACT. SINCE -- THROUGH AGE RATHER JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN HIGH SPEED RAIL SUPPORTED APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND DIRECT INDIRECT IN INDUCED JOB YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT. ALL THIS ACTIVITY HAS RESULTED IN ALMOST THREE MINUTES THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS. THIS INCLUDES AGAIN INCOME FROM DIRECT INDIRECT AND INDUCED ACTIVITIES. THE INVESTMENT IN ICE BE ROUTE HAS RESULTED IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TOTALING OVER SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WITH TOTAL PROGRAM PROGRAM EXPENDITURES OF FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION. THIS MEANS THAT EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN HIGH SPEED RAIL RESULTS IN ABOUT A DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. 54% OF THE X. THIRTIES EXPENDITURES HAVE OCCURRED AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN HERE USE THE DEFINITION OF AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WOULD SUFFER MOST FROM A COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS. THESE BURNS INCLUDE POVERTY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE AS WELL AS AIR AND WATER POLLUTION AND HAZARDOUS WASTE. AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AUTHORITY HAS HAD FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES WORKING ON THE PROGRAM STATEWIDE. THE AUTHORITY HAS A 30% SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION CALL. INCLUDING 10% DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION. AND 3% DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PARTICIPATION. IN SUMMARY CALIFORNIA'S DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL. BY GETTING TRAINS ON THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS NEAR COMPLETION AND CONSTRUCTION IS UNDERWAY. COMPLAINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK STATEWIDE BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO COMPLETING THE BOOK IN COMMITMENTS IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND BEING PREPARED TO EXPAND THE SYSTEM CONSISTENT WTH PROP ONE EIGHT AS FEDERAL IN OR PRIVATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES MATERIALIZE. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS DURING THIS BY BEING TRANSPARENT ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. MAINTAINING OUR COMMITMENTS TO THE PARTNERS. AND DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL WHILE LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS. THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE OF IN TERMS OF YOUR TIME LINE CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA ABOUT THAT RICHARD. TIME LINE'S GOING TO BE -- YOU'RE GOING TO CONSIDER A SOME DOCUMENTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT TO US IN MAY -- IS THAT DOCUMENT GOING TO BE REVIEWED BY THE HIGH SPEED REAL. OR COMMITTEE BEFORE THEN OR HOW HOW ARE YOU PROCEEDING. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A WORKSHOP ON HOW HOW ARE YOU PROCEEDING WITH THAT. FROM FROM NOW THROUGH APRIL AND MAY -- MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT. AS YOU KNOW THE HIGH SPEED ROSE COMMITTED TO GETTING THAT. PROJECT UP THE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MAY FIRST -- THERE IS A HIGH SPEED RAIL BOARD HEARING IN APRIL AND I KNOW -- THE THE BOARD INTENDS TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THAT -- PROJECT UPDATE REPORT NOT TODAY BY BELIEVE NOT THE FULL REPORT WILL BE RELEASED BUT SOME OF THE PRESENTATIONAL BE PROVIDED BY STAFF TO THE BOARD FOR COMMENT AND ALSO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO IS THE BOARD GOING ALONG. CONSIDER VARIOUS OPTIONS -- TO TAKE PLACE AT THAT TIME OR WHAT HIS INTENTIONS. BY THE A THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IS AS WAS STATED WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. YEAH THERE'S WORK WITH THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE OPTIONS IN MORE DETAIL THE COST ISSUES THE EARLY SERVICE. OPTIONS AND SO THAT'S WHAT -- IS GOING TO BE BUILT INTO THE PER WHITES TAKING ON MORE TIME IS TO YOU KNOW DAD GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON THAT ARLY CENTRAL VALLEY SERVICE. AND PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON WHAT THAT SERVICE WOULD LOOK LIKE. HEY ARE YOU -- GOING TO DEFINE. THE DIFFERENCES IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. THE IT'LL TAKE PLACE WITH THE PROPOSAL IN MAY. SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCES. THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING SURE YES TO THIS WALL THAT IN OF COURSE IS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE ROUNDED THAT. PROJECT UPDATE REPORTING THIS WOULD PROVIDE THOSE UPDATES TO THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT -- OKAY -- EIGHTEEN THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE BAY AREA SPECIFICALLY. ARE INTERESTED IN. WHAT CHANGES YOU'RE PROPOSING TO THE VALLEY TO VALLEY SEGMENT -- RELATIVE TO ENGINEERING RIGHT AWAY -- OTHER ACTIVITIES -- HOW IT CONNECTS WITH THE? OUR AREA AND I THINK THE SAME THING WOULD APPLY TO LOS ANGELES AREA. ONE CHANGES YOU'RE PROPOSING OR ENHANCEMENTS. YOU WANT TO CONSIDER EITHER ONE OF THEM. TERMS OF FUNDING. IN TERMS OF RIGHT AWAY OF ENGINEERING. YOU KNOW GETTING THE PROJECT -- YOU KNOW READY FOR ANY FUTURE FUNDS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN GETTING. AND ARE YOU GOING TO BE LOOKING AT A CONTINGENCY PLAN THAT COULD. RESULT AS A RESULT OF THE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DOING. TERMS OF THE NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION. DOLLARS YOU LOOKING LIKE A CONTINGENCY. PREPARING ON YOUR CONTINGENCY FOR THAT -- SO WE BUILD TO KNOW. WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE? ON THE PROJECT -- IN THE IF THEY DECIDE TO PURSUE THAT HORRIBLE COURSE OF ACTION. AND WEEKEND THAT TALK MORE ABOUT THAT WHEN WE COME BACK -- TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE NEXT BECAUSE CLEARLY A TAKING NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION OUT OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE HARMFUL. AND HAPPY. TO DELVE INTO THAT IN MORE DETAIL MISTER SECRETARY LOOKING LIKE TO YOUR WAS I CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT CALIFORNIA ON THE FORMULAS. DON'T GET. CHARLIE THE TAXES THAT WE PAID TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TRANSPORTATION TAXES. IN THE FORMALISM BACK TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE SORT OF MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BY THE GRANTS THAT WE GIVE FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AND WAS THAT A FAIR CONCLUSION. YOU'RE HAVING AND THAT WAS MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN THE PRETTY ACCURATE OVER A LONG TERM. YOU TEND TO BE -- I THINK CHARACTERIZES AS DONOR STATE HONORS AND A LOT OF THE HIGHWAY INVESTMENT IN SOME OF THEIR COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS IN FACT SOME OF THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS HAVE 10% CAPS ON HOW MUCH ANYONE STATE CAN GET AND OF COURSE OUR POPULATION OF THE NATION'S ABOUT AND MANY TIMES ARE ARE A COMPETITIVE -- AB APPLICATIONS CAN BE BELOW THAT 10% -- SOMETIMES SIGNIFICANTLY IN DIFFERENT GRANT ROUNDS BUT AS YOU SAY. YOU KNOW BECAUSE CALIFORNIA INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRANSIT. THAT'S BEEN AN AREA WHERE WIZ RECEIVED -- YOU KNOW MORE THAN OUR POPULATION SHARE TO MAKE UP FOR SOME OF THE DEAF SHORTFALLS IF YOU WILL IN OTHER MODES RIGHT. AND THAT'S BEEN THE TRADITIONAL WAY WE MADE IT UP THIS TRYING TO GET THESE GRANTS AND YOU KNOW TRY TO BALANCE IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AS MUCH AS WE CAN I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER RECEIVED. I HAVE HE ADDED UP FOR A LONG TERM I THINK WE'RE STILL A QUOTE DONORS STATE. A TRUE. THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT YEAH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HAS BEEN AUGMENTING -- THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND WITH FEDERAL GENERAL FUNDS BUT IF YOU LOOK AS A PROPORTION YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT -- NO IT TIMES -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD SET A 93% -- MINIMUM -- RETURN ON SOME OF THE HIGHWAY FUNDS AND IN FACT WE WERE AT THAT LEVEL FOR MANY YEARS AND CHAU AGAIN AS THAT HIGHWAY FUNDS BEEN SUPPLEMENTED WERE ABOVE THAT BUT AGAIN STILL PROPORTIONATELY WE HAVE THIS. ISSUE OF BEING A DONOR STATE OF THE AIR THE ERROR OF FUNDS -- SENATORS STONE IN CAP AND CENTER GALGIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS THERE ARE FUNDS WERE TO HELP THE THE THE TIME IN OUR COUNTRY. THAT WAS UNDER ECONOMIC CRISIS AND WAS. TO HELP STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. AND IN CALIFORNIA GOT CUT -- THE GRANT FOR THIS BECAUSE THE VERY AREA THAT WE WERE SPENDING THE MONEY IN. FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WAS ONE OF THE WORST HIT. ECONOMIC AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND CALIFORNIA'S STILL HAS THE HIGHEST. PERCENTAGE WISE. OF OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY. IN THE UNITED STATES SO THE ERROR FUNDS WERE MEN HELP THOSE AREAS THAT HAD AN ECONOMIC -- DOWNTURN AND IT'S STILL IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF ERROR FUNDS WERE STILL. AGAIN A DONOR'S STATE AND IN THAT PART OF MONEY I I I I I BELIEVE IS THAT TRUE. AND YOU HAVE ANY CON MISTER CHAIRMAN. LOOKS LIKE MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE LADY THAT WORKED YEAH GO AHEAD YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THE RECOVERY ACT FUNDS WERE TO TRYING COURAGE -- ECONOMIC GROWTH PARTICULARLY IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT NEEDED THE MOST. THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WERE TWO OF THE HARDEST HIT SPOTS. IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND SO INVESTING THERE WAS A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME IT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA. OF AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IS AS AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE IN LINE AMP AND AT THROUGH THE THROUGH CONNECTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTO THE BAY AREA. AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WAS THE INTENT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUING TO INVEST THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT OF THE FUNDS. AND IT'S ALSO GOOD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THE IDEA OF TAKING THOSE MONIES AND SPENDING -- WHEREVER ELSE WAS. NOT PART OF OUR PLAN BECAUSE WE WERE INDEED SPENDING IT AT ONE OF THE POOREST AREAS OF CALIFORNIA CORRECT [inaudible] THE TRUE. OKAY SO SO -- DO YOU DO. IN. CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE US -- OVERVIEW OF WHAT KIND OF FALL. RELATIONSHIP OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. ENTER INTERACTIONS ARE GONNA HAVE WITH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. ON THIS REVISED PLANS CAN GIVE SCOPE OUT THAT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS -- RELATIVE TO US WERE APPROACHING OUR BUDGET SEASON -- WE'RE HAVING HEARINGS IN THE COMMITTEE -- AND I GUESS. CENTER WHITE HOUSE VIEW OF A HEARING. ON THIS SUBJECT COMING UP CORRECT WE HAVE A HEARING ON THURSDAY AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS. FIVE ON THE CAP INTRIGUED GRINNELL CAP AND TRADE FUND AND NEXT MONTH FOR TRANSPORTATION -- SO I THINK AT THAT TIME YOU -- TERMS OF THOSE HEARINGS WE WON THE WAR MAKE SURE A STRONG. INTERACTION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND OF COURSE THE PUBLIC ON ON DISCUSSING THESE -- OPTIONS ARE WHAT THE DIRECTIONS GOING TO BE SO WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP ON DOING THAT IS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. ONE NO IT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I SING ME A LOT BUT I DO I WANT OTHER MEMBERS. YEAH I I THINK WITH WITH BIG PROJECTS OF THIS TYPE OF THE PUBLIC. ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE ENGAGE SO WE LOOK FORWARD. TO GROW. A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH ALL OF YOU AND AS I MENTIONED THAT THE BOARD WILL MEET IN IN APRIL. AND WE WE HAVE -- THERE IS HEARINGS COMING UP SO ANTICIPATED -- YOU KNOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO THEM. AND WE ALSO EXPECT THROUGH THAT PROCESS BECAUSE ALL OF THE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT ARE. AS PART OF THE AUTHORITIES DIRECTION. WILL BE REVIEWED AT THE BOARD MEETINGS ALL IN PUBLIC WE ALSO EXPECT TO HAVE. A ON A VERY ROBUST TRANSPARENT. THE BILL WOULD BE TO SAY WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE DOING AND HOW READ GOING. WE GET REGAIN TRUST BY HAVING CONFIDENCE AND WORKS DOING WHAT WE SAY WE'RE DOING. I'LL JUST SAY THIS FOR THE BAY AREA. AND PROBABLY A LOS ANGELES A LOT A LOT OF US -- IN TERMS OF THEIR IN A REGIONAL REGIONAL AND OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS THAT WE ARE. SPENDING. ACTUALLY PROBABLY FEDERAL UP WAY MORE MONEY THAN YOUR SPENDING WE'RE UP ALL THE TRANSIT DISTRICTS IN. WE'RE GONNA HEAR THEM NACS THEY'RE PROBABLY IN TERMS OF SPENDING MONEY SPENDING MORE MONEY ON PROJECTS. THEN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE TRANSIT PROJECTS AND SO FORTH. THE HOUSE IN SALES TAX ALL THE ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA LA ORANGE COUNTY IN. SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE ALL THESE AREAS ARE SENDING A LOT OF MONEY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IN TERMS OF IN RELATIONSHIPS IN TERMS OF ANY CHANGES IN THE PLAN. THAT THE COMMUNICATION OF WORK YOU'RE DOING. DOESN'T CAUSE AN INCREASE IN COST FOR ANY OF THOSE. PROJECTS AT OTHER AGENCIES ARE DOING THEY'RE GONNA TALK NEXT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS ****. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. THERE BE THIS INNER CONNECTION. OUR DISCUSSION LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN MY AREA THE SENATE IS A DERON STATION -- PROJECT WHEN -- BART PROJECT HAS BEEN UNDER CONSTRUCTION. IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE WERE WE DON'T WANNA. PUT TO THE BARD IN THERE THEN. FINISH SHOULD THEN. COUPLE YEARS LATER HAVE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL DIG UP TO STATION AGAIN. HAVE TO DO A NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THERE. AS EXAMPLES OF THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT -- ANOTHER ONE DAY A STRANGE. A CAPITAL QUARTER -- OTHER BART PROJECTS -- WE WANT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIMING AND COORDINATION. pLIKE -- LOSS OR TO REQUEST -- FROM THE CONSTRUCTION SIDE OF THINGS WHAT IS YOUR CONSTRUCTION. OUTGOING CONSTRUCTION COST THE SPENDING THAT YOU'RE SPENDING ARE SLOWING DOWN OR USE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE THE CONSTRUCTION. ARE YOU -- ON A SPENDING MONEY -- AS PER PLANNED OR YOU SLOWING DOWN OR OR WHAT'S HAPPENING. WITH THE CONSTRUCTION. AND RIGHT AWAY IN ENGINEERING SAID SLOWING DOWN. YES SIR RIGHT NOW AS YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST COMING THROUGH THE WINTER MONTHS A LITTLE BIT SLOW DOWN. BUT SHE TO THAT GREAT WET ON FEBRUARY MONTH IN THE VALLEY SO WE EXPECT T. SANO SLIDES. IS IS UP TAKING CONSTRUCTION WE'VE BEEN WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON RELEASING SITES. AND PIECES OF ALIGNMENT AS A GOOD BILL WHICH THAT. GET THE WORK GOING GET THE WAR. VERY SPECIFIC FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL SITES INDIVIDUAL BRIDGES INDIVIDUAL MILES ALIGNMENT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED COULD AFFECT THEIR FRAZIER SOLD SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF HIGH SPEED RAIL BONDS TODAY SO I EXPECT ALL THEIR MONEY TO BE SPENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OKAY JUST. YOU KNOW WE WHAT THE WE WANT TO CONSTRUCTION -- I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD -- THE FASTER YOU SPEND. OF THE BEST VALUE IN GOOD TERMS OF COSTLY ONE OF DO THOSE KINDS OF CONSTRUCTION. WE WANT TO SEE WHAT THE CONSTRUCTION AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT ANALYZE A COURSE BY OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S AND OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND OUT -- IN TERMS OF YOUR CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES -- WE HAVE SOME OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS AS CENTER WHAT COUNTS IN ANSWER GALGIANI AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON INDICATED THAT ONCE UPON A TIME THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION WAS. A HAPPY PLACE TO COME FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL I INTO MADE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME. UNNECESSARY DELAYS OR PROJECT ACTIVITIES -- CAN YOU TOUCH ON THAT IF. WHAT'S THE SITUATION CURRENTLY WITH THE FRA IN AND IF AND IF THERE ARE DELAYS OR AB. YEAH I'M APPROVAL OR ACTIVITIES IS THERE A WORKAROUND POSSIBLE ON THAT. I MIGHT START IN AND JOE YOU CAN CORRECT ME BUT YOU KNOW. THAT WE HAVE THEY HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE F. R. A. OVER THE YEARS ONE OF THE PROJECTS WE KICKED OFF JOINTLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS THIS ISSUE OF A NATIONAL ON VIA VERMIN A POLICY ACT ASSIGNMENT OR NEED BY SIMON AND YOU KNOW DEVELOPED A PACKAGE -- I I WORKED ON THAT WE WENT TO WASHINGTON WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH STAFF -- THAT NEED ASSIGNMENT PACKAGE -- WAS FINALIZED POSTED IN SPRING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON FEDERAL WEBSITES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- THE GOVERNOR BROWN FORMALLY SIGN THE APPLICATION IN JUNE. AND THAT'S BEEN UNDER FEDERAL. A CONSIDERATION SINCE BEEN WITHOUT ACTION -- THE OTHER THING THAT'S UNFORTUNATE IS WHILE THEY'RE PHÃN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR ASSIGNMENT THAT STOP WORK AT STOP THE NEED TO WORK. ON THE TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL -- AB THE CHANGES THAT ARE INTO THEM THAT'S THE BAKERSFIELD -- LOCAL A PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE IN THE WHY IN THE SOUTH OF MERCED. AND SO THOSE ARE -- PROJECTS WHERE THIS SEQUEL -- PROCESS IS MOVING FORWARD I IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE NEPA HAS STALLED AND IN JODY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. YES SIR -- IT'S INTERESTING HERE IS THE REFEREE'S CREATED A PARADIGM. THE SENSE THAT THEY'VE MANDATED -- FULFILLMENT OF THE ARE. AND THAT IS YOU KNOW BASICALLY THE VANCE IN OF THE RODS AND THEN NODS RECORDS DECISION. THROUGH THROUGH THE PROCESS BY A TWELVE TWENTY TWO HOWEVER WITH THE LACK OF PARTICIPATION IN THAT PROCESS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT IMPOSSIBLE. NOW AS A SIGNATURE YOU SALUTE WE ARE DANCING. FANCY THAN VITAMIN A CLEARANCE TO THE CALIFORNIA PROCESS. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE NOT PROCESS AS IN TO GAIN THE INSIGHT THAT WERE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OF THAT PLANNING. THE FURTHER MEN OF FOR COST ESTIMATES. AND WORKING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO EVOLVE AND RESOLVE SOME OF THE ISSUES. OKAY AT THE OTHER THING I WOULD I GUESS I WANTED UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE REACHING YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE CAP. THERE IS A PART PART OF THE ONE A SET UP A MINISTRY OF CAP THAT YOU HAD IN IN WHAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE. OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR FOR THAT EVENT. RESPOND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SO AT A CURRENT. ADMIN BUDGET AND THE ADMIN BUDGET AGAIN IS TO PAY STATE STAFF -- IT'S AT FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- WE WILL ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF OUR PROP WHEN A TWO POINT 5% IN ABOUT TWO YEARS BUT TO FISCAL YEAR -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF WE WERE TO GET THE 5% INCREASE AND WE WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ALLOWS US TO INCREASE OF UP 25% -- AT THE CURRENT BURN RATE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EXTEND OUR ADMIN BUDGET UP UNTIL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX OKAY SO WHERE DOES GET NOW THAT'S THAT'S AT YOUR FINNISH. OKAY SIR GALGIANI THANK YOU. I DID READ THROUGHTHE BUSINESS PLAN AND I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT YOU ANSWER BUT I WANTED TO VERIFY. THE BUSINESS PLAN SAID THAT THE ALTERNATIVE. IN THE BAKERSFIELD ERROR AREA. HAD APPROVAL OF THE SEA QUEST AND WAS AWAITING FINAL APPROVAL I WANTED TO VERIFY THAT. IT THE SEQUEL IS DONE AND THAT IT'S THE KNEE BUT THAT WERE WAITING ON YES MA'AM THE SEQUEL IS COMPLETED AS OF NOVEMBER -- WE ARE CURRENTLY WAITING ON THE NAY PO WE THIS SUBMITTED THAT TO THE FRA. THREE GUARDS TO THE REVIEW THEY HAVE NOT MADE ANY COMMENTS AS A DATE. OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND ITEM HE THERE WHY THAT WE REFER TO WHERE THEY TRAIN CONTINUES NORTH OR IT SPLITS WEST. TO GILROY IN SAN JOSE -- THAT WHY. WAS I THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE WAS I'D DONE A FIGHT IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE SEQUEL WAS APPROVED. IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN MA'AM ONLY IN THE NORTHERN MOST MORE THAN EIGHT MILES OF THAT. AS YOU APPROACH MORE SAID THAT YOU HAVE BASICALLY SYKORA AND IS FOR FILLED FOR THAT -- WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING THE SEQUEL FOR THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THAT OKAY. AND THEN -- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE COMING UP WITH THE COST THAT REMAINS TO GET TO MERCED FOR THAT LAST TWENTY FIVE MILES. IS THAT INCLUDING THE WHY. JUST TO MERCED OR YOU ALSO INCLUDING IN THAT COST ESTIMATE THE WHY THAT HEADS TOWARDS SAN JOSE. BECAUSE EMIGRATE IN OPERATIONAL SEGMENT WE'VE INCLUDED BASICALLY THE WESTERN PORTION OF THAT AS AN TO COME INTO MERCED WE ARE COUNTING THOUGH FOR THE TOTAL Y.. AS WE ADVANCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WE HAVE NOT FORGOT OUR COMMITMENT. OKAY AND THEN -- WHEN WE CAN WHEN WE COMPETED FOR THE ARE DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND AND -- NINE CALIFORNIA IT ORIGINALLY HAD MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AS ONE OF THE SEGMENTS WITH THAT WAS OUTLINED IN PROP ONE NAY. BUT BECAUSE WE WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE SEGMENT COULD HOLD BACK THE OTHER. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AT THAT TIME ACTUALLY SPLIT SPLIT THAT ENTIRE USABLE SEGMENT UP INTO MERCED FRESNO FRESNO TO BAKERSFIELD. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT FOR OR COULD THERE BE ANY THOUGHT FOR TAKING THE MERCED TO SAN JOSE SEGMENT. AND LOOKING AT SMALLER BUILDING BLOCKS IF YOU WERE PERHAPS AT MERCED TO THE BASE OF THE TUNNELS. THE TUNNELS BEING A SECOND SEGMENT AND PERHAPS THE GILROY TO SAN JOSE SO THAT WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT WOULD BE THE COSTS. FOR EACH AND AS A BODY THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE WHETHER WE WANT TO ADVANCE SOME MONIES FOR LAND ACQUISITION. AND ONE AREA OR ANOTHER AND AND HOW HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND GET THEIR SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND NINE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE STRATEGY IS IS A GREAT STRATEGY AND THAT'S CALM OF THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE AS WE CHE. AS WE COME INTO THE VALLEY THE VALLEY. ALMOND LOOKING AT BASICALLY AND THEN THE BIG PIECE THE STUDY THERE IS IS THE PROJECT O'DONNELL'S UNDERSTANDING. UNDERSTANDING THAT TRUE COST US THE BIG DRIVER IN THAT SEGMENT -- IN ADVANCING OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME THE GEO TECHNICAL WORK. SO THAT'LL GIVE US A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE COST IS AND ALSO TO WITH REGARDS TO MAKING IT A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. THE MORE INFORMATION YOU NOW THE LESS RESCUE HALF SO IT MAKES IT MORE VIABLE TO HAVE THOSE P. THREE TYPE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I'D WHEN I LOOKED AT YOUR PRESENTATION. WE LOOK AT PROJECTS SO THE PROJECT UNDER WAY. CONTRACTS UNDERWAY [inaudible] OF AND YOU SEE THE RED IN HER COULD YOU. I WANT TO KNOW. ARE THERE ARE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE FALLING BEHIND SCHEDULE. IN THOSE RED AREAS AND IF SO WHAT ARE THEY YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE A MONITORING SYSTEM FOR THAT CORRECT. SO COULD YOU GIVE ME A LIST OF THOSE. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE WHY THEY'RE FALLING BEHIND. I LIKE TO KNOW I MEAN -- I I I I AM I'M SERVE I I SEE THAT IS SO. WHEN THEY FALL BEHIND IT SIR LIKE WHAT'S THE CONTRACTOR DOING THIS THE QUESTION? IS THE CONTRACTOR. PROCEEDING EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH THE PROJECT [inaudible] OR TODAY THE LITTLE SPECIAL TREATMENT. ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PEOPLE. OKAY SO I WANNA YOU KNOW THIS KIND OF BASIC QUESTION. IF YOU IF YOU HAVE DELAY CONTRACTS THAN. THEY'RE GOING TO EAT A PART CASH BASICALLY. THERE IS NO PART CASH BY DELAYING THE PROJECTS. SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF LIKE PUSH IT. YOU KNOW MOVE THE PROJECT SO WE DON'T HAVE THEM. DRAIN US. WORSE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE OKAY. YES SIR THAT IS THE STRATEGY. IS BASICALLY IS TO WORK BY OWNING GLOVES. AND A PUSH AND A PUSH WITH THE CONTRACTORS TO GET TO WORK WE'VE TAKEN THE EVEN SOME VERY STRATEGIC -- APPROACHES AS ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE IS BRINGING IN FILL IN TWO THREE WHERE WE HAVE OBSTACLE WITH RIGHT AWAY WE CANNOT BRING IT IN FROM THE EAST. SO WE PAID A LITTLE BIT DIVISIONAL AS AN TO BRING AN END TO THE WEST WAS A LONGER HAUL. AND IN DOING SO KEPT THE PROJECT MOVING. A NEW HAVE A NEW RIGHT AWAY LAW WE WE PASSED THE SB WHAT WAS IT SEVEN ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO LAST YEAR THAT. I AUTHORED THAT WOULD. ALLOW YOU TO DIRECTLY BY RIGHT AWAY RATHER THAN. THROUGH THE REGULAR STATE PROCESS AND THAT'S GOING TO CAN YOU COMMENT ON HOW THAT STILL TO IN TERMS OF A EXPEDITING A RIGHT AWAY PURCHASE PROGRAMS. YES SIR WE ARE USING I'M ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO TO OUR FAN H. WE HAVE JUST STARTED THAT PROCESS YOU'RE SEEING AN UPTICK IN WITH THE CARDS THE NUMBER OF RIGHT AWAY SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROCURE. RIGHT NOW OUR STRATEGY IS IS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE CALL THOSE CRITICAL PARTIALS THOSE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BUY IN THE MEDIA. AS AN TO KEEP THE CONSTRUCTION MOVING FORWARD. I THINK THE RIGHT AWAY -- JUST REAL TO THE CENTER GALGIANI COMMENTS THE TO RIGHT AWAY BETWEEN SALAS AND WORSE -- THAT OUGHT TO BE A PRIORITY. THE THE YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY. GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON IN SILICON VALLEY A HOUSING LAND USE PROPERTY VALUES. THE QUICKER YOU CAN BUY THE PROPERTY THE BETTER I MEAN YOU CAN'T. IF I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THE MORE. WHEN YOU START TO GET INTO THE BAY AREA URBAN AREA THE PROPERTY VALUES JUST GOING UP SO FAST? IT'S A VERY COMMON FINE YOU. TO TRY TO SECURE RIGHT AWAY IN YOUR DECISION MAKING ON PRIORITIES BECAUSE THE RIGHT AWAY DELAYS. WOULD BE VERY COSTLY. AND ELISE'S SILICON VALLEY I KNOW CERTAINLY AND ALSO TO SOME EXTENT LOS ANGELES AREAS WORLD PROPERTY VALUES ARE GOING UP VERY QUICKLY [inaudible] OKAY WITH. MY FOLLOW UP ON YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT THE CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE NUMBER ONE MAYBE WE CAN GET THAT UP THERE -- WHICH IS A THIS IS PAGE TWENTY FOUR BEFORE THE IN JANUARY WE HAD -- SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE MILES UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN IN DECEMBER WE'RE GONNA HAVE EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE SO THERE'S PROGRESS ON MILES IN THE CONSTRUCTION. THERE WERE WERE NO SEGMENTS THAT WERE COMPLETED AND THERE WERE NO AND IN DECEMBER THERE'S NO SEGMENTS COULD BE COMPLETED. WAS THE OTHER THE AD SHERMAN BELLS WAS THAT. ALWAYS ANTICIPATED BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE TWO YEARS TO BUILD THOSE SEGMENTS OR WAS THERE SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT. AN INTERVENTION THEY CAME IN FOR BECAUSE OF THESE DELAYS THAT YOU KNOW. FOR FOR THE MILE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BUT WE JUST. WE COULDN'T GET THE CLEARANCE OR WEAKENED CONTRACTOR DID SOMETHING I MEAN IT WAS THAT THE SCHEDULE THAT WE EIGHT WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED TWO YEARS AGO OR THREE YEARS AGO. SIR NOW THAT IS NOT TO SCHEDULE. AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE REGIONAL CONTRACTING POLLUTION DATES AND ALL THREE OF THOSE WE ARE. AT THEM OR PASS THEM BASICALLY ALL THREE THE SEGMENTS WHAT IS HAPPENING ALL THROUGH THE SAVINGS IS WE JUST ARTICULATED. THROUGH THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD BASICALLY WITH PROCUREMENT OF RIGHT AWAY. AND WHAT WE CALL CALL BASICALLY CONTRIBUTING SCOPE SO SHE TO PREDOMINATELY WITH THIRD PARTIES A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE INTRUSION PRODUCTION BARRIER SYSTEMS. ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGE AND RAILROADS SINCE WE DID NOT HAVE A MASTER AGREEMENT IN PLACE AT TIME OF AWARD. RIGHT WE NEGOTIATED THOSE MASTER AGREEMENT SIEGE TO MAKE THAT REQUIREMENT. OUT NOW THAT WE HAVE THOSE AGREEMENTS AND WE KNOW WHAT THE REQUIREMENT IS WHICH IS REQUIRED BASICALLY ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE WE'VE ARTICULATED BEFORE. IN THE PROPOSED COST OVER RUNS AT THOSE KASTRO RUNS A BIG PIECE OF THEM HAD BEEN TO SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO CONSTRUCTION. DOES SHE ALSO HAVE IN THAT CASE MORE TIME MORE TIME. THE GAL JENNY. ALSO TO RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE -- THERE WAS AN EMPHASIS ON EARLY WORKS PROJECTS SO IN OTHER WORDS THE BRIDGES AND THE GRADE SEPARATIONS SO THAT COMMUNITIES WOULD FEEL SOME BENEFITS. BEFORE THEY WOULD JUST FEEL HIGH SPEED RAIL COMING IN AND TEARING THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TEARING UP THE ROADS AND SO FORTH. AND ALSO TO MA'AM THATIS THE CRITICAL PATH OF THE PROJECT IS THOSE STRUCTURES. IF YOU LOOK AT AND THEN FRESNO THOSE ICONIC STRUCTURES YOU DRIVE BY. THOSE THOSE MILE LONG VIADUCTS THAT IS THE CRITICAL PATH TO THE CONSTRUCTION. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND KEEP WORKING HARD AND LET'S TRY TO GET THAT. NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS STAYING IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T WANT TO GO. TO WE DON'T WANT TO GO THE TAXES ARE FLORIDA TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT. BECAUSE I I I I THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR MONEY. THAT'S OUR MONEY. LET'S NOT GO TO THE SITE HAVE THEIR MONEY SLIP AWAY. OKAY WE HAVE AN EXPAND ONLY A JIM HARDEN A CALTRAIN AND STEPHANIE WIGGINS'S -- CO METROLINK [inaudible] AND JENNETTE -- LANCE'S SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT LA METRO SO WE'RE GONNA HEAR THE REGIONAL INVESTMENTS AND HOW THAT'S GOING AND AND GUYS FIGURE OUT GET YOUR STUFF. WHO'S GOING FIRST OKAY. STEPHANIE OR YOU. YOU JUST GOT APPOINTED RIGHT. WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SO EXCITED CONGRADULATIONS FIND THE THE IN OUR NEW IG. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT METROLINK IT'S IT'S GREAT. TO TO SEE YOU HERE WITH US FOR THE FIRST TIME IS YOUR IN YOUR NEW POSITION. SO CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND WE'LL START WITH JIM AND JIM -- ARNETT AND HE'S THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AT CALTRAIN SO. THANK YOU TEARS. ANSWER BILL IT'S A PARTICULAR PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE TO TO PRESENT AGAIN ON A UPDATE ON OUR CALTRAIN SYSTEM ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAM -- AND IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO PRESENT TO CENTER BILL TO YOU SINCE YOU WERE ON THE BOARD YEARS AGO AND NO MORE ABOUT. TO THE TRAIN SYSTEM THAN MOST IS SO -- I HOPE BY I DON'T BORE YOU WITH SOME THINGS THAT TO YOU YOU KNOW ALL TOO WELL [inaudible] SAID THE BUT AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE PROBABLY ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING TRANSIT REGIONAL BOARD IN NINETEEN NINETY TO NINETEEN NINETY TWO A YOUNG AND TENDER AGE. YES. A LONG TIME AGO YES SO WEB BUT IT AS YOU KNOW YOU LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR A A A FAST GROWING TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING AND IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE CURRENTLY ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND RIDERS PER DAY ON NINETY TWO TRAINS HONOR WEEK DAYS -- CONNECTING SAN FRANCISCO. SAN JOSE AND SELL TO GILROY -- WE ESTIMATE. AT LEAST I I DO A SIMPLE CALCULATION EVERY SINGLE WORK DAY THERE'S ABOUT ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES NOT DRIVEN BECAUSE OF FOLKS -- WHO RIGHT ARE CALTRAIN SYSTEMS WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IMPACT ON CONGESTION? IN THE REGION TO JUST BY WHAT WE DO TODAY. BUT THE ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN IS CAN ALLOW US TO DO MORE -- AS SOON AS SOME OF YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE BUSINESS PLANNING PROCESS IT IS LOOKING. TO WHAT THE DEMAND WOULD BE FOR OUR SERVICES AS FAR OUT AS TWENTY FORTY AND HOW WE CAN CAPTURE THAT DEMAND WHAT THE INVESTMENTS -- WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO SO WE WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE CAN -- EASILY DOUBLE OUR RIDERSHIP IN IN LIKELY TRIPLET WITH THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS BUT THE ELECTRIFICATION IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THAT -- YOU KNOW OUR OUR RIGHT OF WAY -- BEGAN TO EXIST IN THE DAYS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN -- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A FOUNDATIONAL CHANGE NOW BY WHAT WE DO WITH OUR INVESTMENTS TO BRING US INTO THE MODERN. ERA BUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN THAT WILL BE COMPLETE OF LIKELY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE ROADMAP FOR AN EXPANDED. ELECTRIFIED SERVICE THAT EVENTUALLY WILL INCLUDE HIGH SPEED RAIL OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN INCLUDES A HIGH SPEED RAIL -- WE ARE -- WE ARE PARTNERS IN A STRONG BLENDED PLANNING SYSTEM AND ANALYSIS. IN WE WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER AND BLENDED PLANNING. BUT WE ARE SEPARATE AND TO PROJECTS -- THAT DISTINCTION IS MADE CLEAR THROUGH OUR OF VARIOUS -- LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND LEGISLATION AND COURT DECISIONS. AND THE COURT DECISIONS ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HELPFUL FOR BOTH OF US IN THE SENSE THAT -- AS WITH ANY BIG PROJECT -- BUT THE LECTURES CATION PROJECT -- WENT THROUGH LITIGATION BUT THE LITIGATION WAS AIMED MORE AT STOPPING OUR ASSOCIATION WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TO COME THROUGH THAN IT WAS. TO STOP OR ELECTRIFICATION. BUT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IS STILL GOING THROUGH ITS OWN ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS FOR OUR OUR LEGO OF OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. OURS IS COMPLETED IN THE CORD -- WHEN IT RULED THAT IN A WAY THAT I THOUGHT PROTECTED BOTH OF US SAID THE ARE? CALTRAIN CALTRAIN PROJECT IS ONE OF INDEPENDENT UTILITY. THAT CALTRAIN HAS BEEN SEEKING TO EMPLOYMENT FOR NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THE ELECTRIFICATION HAS BEEN -- PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR CALTRAIN FROM THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- AND AS THE COURT SAID THAT YEAR. ELECTRIFICATION IS DISCRETE FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL FUTURE BLENDED. SYSTEM DESIGN CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION. AS TO WHICH SEPARATE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND CERTIFICATION WILL BE REQUIRED HAVEN'T BEEN THAT'S WHAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS WORKING ON NOW IS TO GO THROUGH ITS. IT'S ANALYSIS AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THIS. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW I A REAL REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONTEXT THAT SERVER GALGIANI GAVE AND WITH RESPECT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- I YOU KNOW IT IT REALLY BROUGHT TO MIND A TIME WHEN I WAS ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD AND AND HER GREAT SUPPORT. OF FOR THE FOUNDATIONAL. REQUISITES FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. IN AYE AYE AYE AT THAT TIME AND IN IN STORE NOW BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTMENT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE A REASONS THAT SHE ARTICULATED. AND BECAUSE SPINE YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE SYSTEM. IT JUST AS THE INVESTMENTS IN THE BOOKENDS NORTH AND SOUTH ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THOSE INVESTMENTS IN THE BOOKENDS HAVE INDEPENDENT UTILITY AS THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS IS GETTING IN PLACE AND THAT INDEPENDENT UTILITY. HAS TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR THE REGION AND FOR THE STATE. I IN FACT AT THE REFERENCE TO ACING CAPITOL CORRIDOR AMTRAK -- YOU KNOW THEY CONNECT UP TO OUR CALTRAIN SYSTEM. AND SO -- WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO US IN TERMS OF -- CONNECTIVITY WITH US IN A REAL ROBUST STATEWIDE REAL SYSTEM SO THAT INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS IMPORTANT TO US. TO JUST AS THE COMMITMENT TO OUR THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOOKENDS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE CONFIDENCE THE STATE HAS PUT IN US. WE RECEIVED I IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS ALREADY MENTIONED WE RECEIVED A AND T. I. R. C. P. FUNDS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. UNDER SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL ELECTRIC -- UNITS -- SO WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL OF OF LIKE THE TRAIN SETS -- TO FURTHER -- CAPACITY AND HAVE A CLEANER ELECTRIFIED SERVICE. BUT I CAN SAY TO YOU THAT -- WE ARE -- OUR PROJECT IS IS FORECAST TO BE COMPLETE OUR ON TIME WITHIN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH -- FULLY OPERATIONAL LECTER FIGHT SERVICE IN IS FORECAST TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN BUDGET. AND AS SUCH TIME AS A HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IS READY TO COMMON COMPLETES ITS -- IN FAR MENTAL WORK AND AND HAS HAS OTHER THINGS IN ORDER WE KNOW THAT WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER IN THE QUARTER AND ARE ARE BLENDED SYSTEM AND AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT [inaudible] OKAY -- STEPHANIE I BELIEVE YOUR SOMETHING WE CAN SIMPLY HIS NECK SO [inaudible] METROLINK. THE DEL PERRO. OF GOOD AFTERNOON THERE ARE THE FOR ALL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WHILE THEY WORK ON THE TECHNOLOGY. NOW THAT. TENANTS. I WANNA THANK TERRIBLE TERRIBLE KASKI IN THE SENATORS -- FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON OUR AGENCIES CONTINUED COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. METROLINK PROVIDES COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE TO SIX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES -- THAT'S VENTURA COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SAMITY DINO COUNTY SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND WE TO LIKE CALTRAIN OR NOT ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVING A REGION'S SEVERELY CONGESTED FREEWAYS. AS METROLINX NEW CEO I AM COMMITTED TO DELIVERING A CUSTOMER FOCUS SYSTEM THAT FULLY INTEGRATES METROLINK WITH ALL OF OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PARTNERS. METROLINK IS POISED TO DELIVER SUCCESS ON MANY OF THE PRIORITIES IN THE STATE'S RAIL PLAN. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DOUBLING OUR RIDERSHIP IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I'M ACTUALLY CONNECTS PEOPLE TO OPPORTUNITY EVERY DAY. MY VISION FOR THE REGION IS TO EMERGE AS THE SAFEST MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE AND CUSTOMER FOCUSED REGIONAL RAIL AGENCY ANYWHERE. WE ARE PART OF A LARGER TRANSIT ECO SYSTEM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION TO CONNECT COMMUNITIES AN OPPORTUNITY. MORE THAN 85% OF OUR WRITERS MAKE THE SMART CHOICE EVERY DAY BY LEAVING THEIR CARS AT HOME AND TAKING THE TRAIN. SO MEASURE LINK SERVICE IMPROVE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND REAFFIRMS OUR COMMITMENTS TO A SUSTAINABLE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO WE HAVE OPERATED IN OUR REGION'S MOST TRAVELED CORRIDORS AND URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. OUR FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILES OF TRACK WE SHARE WITH INNER CITY SERVICE ALONG THE LOS AND CORRIDOR. AND BOTH BNSF AND UNION PACIFIC ARE HIGHLY CONSTRAINED IN SUPPORT CRITICAL RAIL OPERATIONS IN A REGION OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE IS KEY TO REDUCING VEHICLE TRIPS CONNECTING HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT CENTERS AND AVOIDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE KNOW THAT RAIL KEEP SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOVING. AS THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES LONG LONG BEACH A WHINY ME CONTINUE TO FORECAST A GROWING INFLUX OF SHIPMENTS COMMERCE WILL CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED VIA RAIL ON SHARED METROLINK RIGHTS OF WAY. TO DESTINATIONS ACROSS THE NATION. METROLINK SERVICE ALSO PROVIDES A CRITICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ACROSS ALL MODES INCLUDING LIGHT RAIL BUS AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMUTER RAIL IS THE LINK TO LOCAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE REGION. WHEN THE STATE FIRST BEGAN DISCUSSING THE INTRODUCTION OF HIGH SPEED SERVICE CONNECTING NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? METROLINK ECHO THE VOICES OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN COLLEGE CLOSE COORDINATION WITH EXISTING PASSENGER RAIL OPERATORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. METROLINK TRAINS CAN CURRENTLY TRAVEL AT SPEEDS UP TO SEVENTY NINE PARK MILES PER HOUR WITH HIGHER SPEEDS POSSIBLE. OUR NEW TWO YEAR FOR LOCOMOTIVES ARE CAPABLE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR WITH IMPROVE TRACK AND OPERATING CONDITIONS. IN OUR EARLY DISCUSSIONS OUR REGION COMMUNICATED ITS SUPPORT OF BEING BOLD AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN CONNECTIVITY AND BOOK AND OPERATIONS. IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE NEED FAR OUTWEIGHED THE AVAILABLE INVESTMENTS AND WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON ENCOURAGING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE PROJECTS THAT SUPPORT EXISTING OPERATORS. ALONG THE IDENTIFIED PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO ROUTES. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. AS THE VISION AND PHASES HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME THE INTRODUCTION OF HIGH SPEED SERVICE AND SHARED URBAN CORRIDORS CONTINUES TO REAFFIRM THE NEED FOR COORDINATION WITH EXISTING RAIL OPERATORS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THIS NEED AND PROVIDED CRITICAL CONNECTIVITY AND BOOK AND INVESTMENTS FOR LOCAL OPERATORS WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS OF PROP ONE A REVENUES TO PROJECTS. ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIMELY COMMITMENT OF REMAINING OBLIGATIONS. THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT WILL TRANSFORM PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE PROJECT IS A CENTRAL PART OF METROLINX LONG TERM CAPITAL PROGRAM. AND UNION STATION IS THE HUB OF OUR RAIL NETWORK AND TRANSFORMING THAT STATION WITH RUN THROUGH TRACKS WILL ACCOMMODATE FUTURE TRANSPORTATION DEMANDS IN THE REGION. AND WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S COORDINATION WITH LA METRO TO FINALIZE THE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING COMMITMENT FOR THE PROJECT. IN ADDITION AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER PANEL THE SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IDENTIFIED FOR THE ROSE QUITE AS ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATION PROJECT. WILL IMPROVE THE SAFETY IN OPERATIONS OF ONE OF THE MOST TRAVERSE PASSENGER AND FREIGHT CROSSINGS IN THE STATE. PROJECT BENEFITS ALSO INCLUDE INCREASING PASSENGER RAIL CAPACITY TO THE INLAND EMPIRE BY AND PROVIDING A CRITICAL A TENTATIVE TO THE FIVE FREEWAY. WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S RECOGNITION OF RAIL FUNDING NEEDS IN THE REGION. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN COMPLETING THE FIRST PHASE BETWEEN MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD THERE ARE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND COORDINATE WITH MET CHILLING FOR THE ANAHEIM TO BURBANK CORRIDOR. WHILE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING FOR PROJECTS SEGMENTS BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND SAN DIEGO CONTINUE WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING FUNDING DISCUSSIONS FOR THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CONNECTIONS. AND THE METROLINK SERVICE AREA THERE ARE PROJECTS WITH INDEPENDENT UTILITY THAT CAN DELIVER SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S. CALIFORNIANS RATHER THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OPTIMIZE RAIL EXPANSION OUR SCORE PROGRAM IS A TEN BILLION DOLLAR CAPITAL PLAN TO UPGRADE THE REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM TO MEET THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF THE TRAVELING PUBLIC. BY ADDING TRACKS GRADE SEPARATIONS AND UPGRADING SIGNAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE IMAGE LINK SYSTEM TRAINS CAN OPERATE MORE FREQUENTLY AND RELIABLY MAKING REGIONAL RAIL EASIER AND MORE CONVENIENT TO USE. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL ALSO BENEFIT FROM A REDUCTION IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. BY WHICH WOULD THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION METRIC TONS WE'RE EXCITED THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS SUPPORTIVE OF OUR SCORE PROGRAM. THE GOAL IS TO DELIVER THE PROGRAM IN TIME TO CONNECT OUR REGION FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES. THE STATE'S COMMITMENT. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT CAN PROJECTS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE SCORE PROGRAM. MAJOR LEAGUE RECEIVED A HISTORIC GRANT AWARD FROM THE TRANSIT IN INNER CITY CAPITAL PROGRAM TO BEGIN FUNDING PROJECTS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND IN ADDITION WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OVER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY IN THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM CORRIDOR AND READY TO BE DELIVERED TO THE REGION IF FUNDING CAN BE SAID. IN CONCLUSION. A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WILL BE COMPLEX AND REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING WITH PARTNERS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING METROLINK. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNICATE EARLY AND OFTEN AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER AND DELIVERING A PREMIER RAIL NETWORK FOR THE REGION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FROM METROLINK -- WILL NOW HEAR FROM. GENERAL ONES FROM THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER LA METRO NUMBER OF YEAH OKAY THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BALLOTS CHAIRMAN WITH KASKI COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SENATORS. MATCH CHAU HAS BEEN WORKING WITH A HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND LIKE ALL NEW LARGE SCALE TRANSFORMATIVE RAIL PROJECTS. MACHU IS FULLY AWARE OF THE CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES FACING HIGH SPEED RAIL. FROM PLANNING ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WAS AN HONEST ASSESSMENT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL COMPLETING THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILE OF OPERATING SEGMENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS THAT COME FROM MAKING MORE INVESTMENTS IN THE RAIL SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT SPEED UP RAIL SERVICE IN. THAT WILL INCREASE TRAVEL TIMES AND IMPROVE COMMUTES FROM PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE ALREADY MAKING TWO TO THREE HOURS COMMUTE ONE WAY? DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY TO THE IMPORTANCE OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL GUIDING PRINCIPLES MAKING STRATEGIC CONCURRENCE. INVESTMENTS IN THE EXISTING RAIL SYSTEM. THAT WILL BE RULING. OVER TIME WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES IMMEDIATE MOBILITY ECONOMIC AND INVOKED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHILE POSITIONING HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL SEGMENTS AS FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE. Q. KEY BOOK AND INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT AND THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GREAT SEPARATION AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THESE TWO PROJECTS. LOS ANGELES UNION STATION IS THE LARGEST MULTIMODAL HUB IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SERVING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THOUSAND PASSENGERS A DAY WITH OUR MATCHES SUBWAY LIGHT RAIL. AND OVER A HUNDRED OVER A THOUSAND BUSES METRO BUSES MUNICIPAL BUSES INCLUDING INTERCITY AMTRAK BUSES. UNION STATION WITH BUILT IN. NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AS SEVENTY TRACKS AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THE PICTURE ALL TRAINS ENTER FROM THE NORTH OF THE NORTH IS WHERE THE THROAT AREA IS THE SOUTH IS WHERE YOU SEATING BOTTOM THAT THE US ONE AND ONE FREE WAY. TODAY EIGHTY YEARS LATER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FROM TWO FROM. NINETEEN THIRTY NINE IT IS LARGELY THE SAME. WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT WOULD BE BUILT ANOTHER SEVEN PLATFORMING UNION STATION SO YOU MAY THINK SIX BACK FROM HERE THERE'S ACTUALLY SEVEN PLATFORMS ALREADY THERE. SO THAT'S THE CHANGE AND EIGHTY YEARS. WELL AT LEAST UNION STATION PROJECT WILL TRANSFORM HOW ARE REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM OPERATES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BY PROVIDING RUN THROUGH TRACKS THAT WILL IN ABLE ONE SEAT RIDES FOR INNER CITY AMTRAK. TRAINS AS FAR NORTH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND AS FAR SOUTH AS SAN DIEGO. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR A REGIONAL RAIL SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT WILL ALSO ACCOMMODATE A FUTURE HIGH SPEED RAIL. WITH UP TO WITH UP TO FOUR TWO PLATFORMS AND FOUR TRACKS. DELINKING IN STATION PROJECT HAS BROKEN OUT INTO TWO PHASES OF YOU SEE HERE IN THE CHART. YOU'LL HAVE THE RUN THROUGH TRACKS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THAT WILL BE PART OF THE PHASE ONE THAT WILL ALSO INCLUDE EARLY TRACK AND SIGNAL WORK. AND THE FACE TIãU ARE WHAT WE CALL PHASE BE WILL ALL WILL NOW INCLUDE THE FULL PLATFORM AND RAISING OF THE RAIL YARD OVER THE US ONE AND ONE FREEWAY. SO HERE IS THE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE FREE FOR THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT PARTICULARLY THE FIRST PHASE WHICH WE CALL PHASE HEY. AS YOU CAN SEE THE BOOK AND PROJECT INVESTMENTS FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO SECURE A FUNDING AGREEMENT FROM THEM. AS EARLY AS SUMMER OF THIS YEAR BUT NO HOPEFULLY NO LATER THAN FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE T. I. R. C. P. AS PART OF METROLINX OVERALL SCORE PROGRAM AWARDED THE LINKING AND STATION PROJECT APPROXIMATELY. THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THE REST OF THE REMAINING IS LOCAL FINDS. HERE IS WHAT WE'RE BUILDING IN A LINKING AND STATION AS PART OF PHASE ONE THE REAL CONSTANT SIGNALS DATES BACK. TO NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND SO IT WE WILL TRANSFORM THAT BY COMPLETELY REVAMPING THE RAIL CONSTANCE SINGLES AT UNION STATION AND COMPLETING ACTION THE ACTUAL BUILD OUT OF THE ENTIRE RUN THRILLED TRACKS. THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALSO A COMEDY THE FUTURE HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUT IT'S PART OF AN INDEPENDENT UTILITY WE WILL START OUT WITH Q. OPERATING RUN THROUGH TRACKS AS PART OF PHASE A SO WE WILL TEMPORARILY BUILT A RUN THROUGH TRACK PLATFORM ON WHAT WE CALL PLATFORM FOR WHICH IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAIL YARD. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH SEPARATING THE KNEE BEND THE SEQUEL. THE SEQUEL IS ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR'S AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED -- WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED THE COMMENTS TO THE DRAFT DIR AND WE HOPE TO FINALIZE THE SEQUEL PROCESS. BUDGET. NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH OVER TO ONE OF THE GREAT SEPARATION THE FIRST BOOK AND PROJECT BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHICH IS THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT. IT WILL SCAN SMARTCARD IS LOCATED IN THE CITY OF SANTA FE SPRINGS. IT IS A DIAGONAL CROSSING SEE YOU CAN SEE HERE THE DIAGONAL CROSSING IT'S LOCATED IN ONE OF THE BUSIEST GOODS MOVEMENT CORRIDOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT IS OWNED BY BURLINGTON NORTH SANTA FE. AND OPERATED BY BNSF AS WELL. THIS BECAUSE OF THE DIAGONAL CROSSING IN BECAUSE OF A OVER A HUNDRED AND TWELVE FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRAINS THAT PASSED BY EACH WEEKDAY. WITH OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND VEHICLES IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS CROSSING BY THE CP YOU SEE IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO ESSENTIALLY TRAINS COME ACROSS THAT THIS GREAT CROSSING EVERY TEN MINUTES. AND FREIGHT TRAINS UNLIKE PASSENGER TRAINS IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG STRETCH I JUST KIND OF WANT TO POINT THAT OUT. HERE IS THE GRADE SEPARATION PROJECT OF THE PROPOSED CONDITION THIS ACCOMMODATES UP. TO FOUR ACCOMMODATES HIGH SPEED RAIL BY INCLUDING UP TO FOUR TRACKS AND JOURNEY FIFTH GRADE SEPARATION. RIGHT NOW BEING A STEP IS COMPLETING THE THIRD -- MAINLINE TRACK BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WHICH WILL ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME SPOTS BECAUSE THIS IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY BEING A STAFF. PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE IS THOUGHT IS PROVIDED TIME SLOTS ALONG THE CORRIDOR. THE WITH THE THIRD MAILING TRACK AND WITH THE GROCERY AS MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATION IT REALLY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME SLOTS FOR METROLINK AN AMTRAK TRAINS. SO HERE'S THE FUNDING PLAN AS YOU CAN SEE. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS PROVIDING 50% OF THE INVESTMENT IN THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED THE BENEFITS OF THIS WE'RE IN IN THE PROCESS OF REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION. WE WE HAVE ALREADY SUBMITTED AT LEAST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THE RESIDENTS MARQUARDT GRAY SEPARATION. WE HOPE TO SICK COMPLETES THE CONSTRUCTION AND UP BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND HOPE TO WARD CONSTRUCTION BY. TWENTY TWENTY THE NOW I'M JUST GOING TO PLAY A VIDEO OF THE LINK UNION STATION PROJECT I DO YOU WANT TO ADD A QUALIFIER THAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A VIDEO THAT THE ROLLS ROYCE OF WHITE. LOS ANGELES UNION STATION COULD BE. AND SO SOME OF THESE ARE NOT BLINDED AND IT'S MORE OF A VISION OF WHAT WE CAN IMAGINE IT TO BE. I AM I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR NOKIA STATE THEATER DOWN IN DOWNTOWN WITH THE STABLE CENTRE NIKITA THEATER. IT WAS THE RIBBON CUTTING WHEN I ATTENDED A RIBBON CUTTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX YOU ONLY SIGN A KIA THEATER BUT NOW WHEN YOU GO BACK THERE TEN YEARS LATER. IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE AT THE LOS ANGELES UNION STATION. SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY NINE LOS ANGELES UNION STATION HAS CONNECTED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE LOS ANGELES REGION TODAY. WE SHOULD OF OVER TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE. UNION STATION IS CENTRAL TO THE TRANSPORTATION FOR THIS. TAKING PLACE IN LA TODAY. THE NEW LANDSCAPE WEST PLAZA SITS BETWEEN THE RETAILER IN THE IN READING [inaudible] PROVIDES ACCESS. THE PASSENGER PLATFORMS OF SERVICE TO THE BAGGAGE HANDLING CAROUSELS CAN BE SEEN TO THE RIGHT. RETAIL KIOSK ADJACENT TO THE FULL RETAIL SPACE. FOR THE AT GREAT KIND OF COURSE THE CITY DOWN. TO THIS ARE LOCATED IN THE IF IT'S TO THE RENOVATED RATED. AS WELL AS TAKING IS IT. THE LINK UNION STATION. IS. TO BE [inaudible] UNION STATION. IT TO A WORLD CLASS. IN THE LASTLY I JUST HAVE ONE MORE VIDEO WHICH IS THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT GRADE SEPARATIONS. REYES GRANTS IN A CART GREAT INTERSECTION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE MOST HAZARDOUS CROSSINGS CALIFORNIA. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND VEHICLES CROSSES RECEPTION DALY. EACH WEEK THE CLASSIC ARMS ARE DOWN. BY. PLEASE PRESS MCCARTY RICH. THE COMPLETE SAFETY BY SEPARATING THE STRANDS BICYCLES AND BEING. FOR TAX OF TRAINS YEAH. METROLINK. TRAIN AS WELL AS THE FUTURE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS WILL GREATLY REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ELIMINATE DELAYS. IN HAD SOME THE REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AND OVERALL. THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- DOES THE QUESTION THAT -- I HAVE IN TERMS OF THERE WERE THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP YOU'VE HAD TO COMPLETE YOUR PROJECTS -- WITH THE PRIOR RAILROAD COMPANIES AND THE HIGH SPEEDRAIL. IN TERMS OF COLLABORATING ON THE USE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AWAY. THE TRACKAGE. HAS THAT. BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S GOTTEN BETTER. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN TERMS OF WORKING OUT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. AND PLANNING TOGETHER. I NOTICED THAT YOU HAD SOME FREE TRAINS GO THROUGH. THAT PARTICULAR A PROJECT. SO THE ROSE FANS MARKET IS ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE TRANSFORMATIONAL WITH -- OUR DEALINGS WITH A HIGH SPEED RAIL THE BEING A STAFF HIGH SPEED RAIL BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BEING A STAFF AND ALSO AS PART OF THE SCORE PROGRAM. THERE -- IT INCLUDES A FOURTH MAINLINE TRACK SO I'M SHOWING A RESTAURANTS MARKET GRADE SEPARATION IT. PROVIDES -- THE ABILITY FOR HIGH SPEED BILL TO COME TROUGH AND BE IN A STAFF AND HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A GREAT RELATIONSHIP IN THAT REGARD -- HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ALSO ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARING -- THE FOURTH MAILING TRACK ALONG THIS CORRIDOR SO IT'S THE FOURTH MAILING TRACK THAT CAN CALM BE ACCOMMODATED THE RESIDENTS MARK MARKET GRADE SEPARATION. SO THE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HIGH SPEED AS A GONE A LOT BETTER -- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN GREAT WORKING CLOSELY IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THEM -- AS YOU KNOW LINKING IN STATION ALSO WORKING WITH NATURAL LINKS. SHARES THE TRACKS WITH THE HIGHS IS PROPOSED TO SHARE THE TRACKS WHEN HIGH SPEED RAIL COMES INTO LOS ANGELES. SO -- WHAT -- THE UNFUNDED PROJECTS. WITH FACILITATE -- BETTER CONNECTIONS. WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT ULTIMATELY IN YOUR AREA. SO MAYBE CAN TALK ABOUT THE SECURE. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIORITIES -- FROM EACH AGENCY. GO AHEAD OF STEPHANIE MY WANT TO START DRILLING. SURE WELL AS PART OF OUR METROLINK SYSTEM THE ANAHEIM TO BURBANK CORRIDOR IS THE PLAN SHARED QUARTER WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL ANAHEIM BEING THE SOUTHERN MOST TERMINUS. AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO HELP US OPERATE HIGHER SPEED RAIL IT IN ORDER TO CONNECT WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL WHEN IT EVENTUALLY COME SOUTH -- I MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE IDENTIFIED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE SHELVE READY OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS INCLUDES. ADDING ADDITIONAL TRACK IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT 60%. OF OUR RAIL NETWORK IS SINGLE TRACK. SO WE HAVE WITHIN OUR RAIL RIGHTS OF WAY ROOM TO ADD A SECOND TRACK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL GRADE SEPARATION PROJECTS ADDITIONAL SIGHTINGS THAT WILL HELP FACILITATE OUR DESIRE TO HAVE HIGHER FREQUENCY SERVICE. TO ATTRACT MORE WRITERS ALL AGAIN TO IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY WITH HIGH SPEED WELL WHEN IT COMES FARTHER SOUTH AND ALSO -- TO PROVIDE AN INCREDIBLE RAIL SHOWCASE BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT WHEN THE OLYMPICS IS HERE AND WE CAN SHOWCASE. A CONNECTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE ANAHEIM ANAHEIM TO THE LA METRO STATION ON A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH TO BURBANK FRANK -- SOWE CONNECT THE BURBANK AIRPORT RIGHT TO ANAHEIM YES SO THAT'S OUR MAJOR SEGMENT THAT'S ALL -- JOINT WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL THE ROLE. SECTION IS THAT TURNING OUT TO BE ONE OF YOUR BUSY IS -- LINES THAT YOU HAVE IS THE BUSIEST QUARTER WE HALF BECAUSE WE SHARE IT WITH AMTRAK'S LOS AND CORD OR ON THE ALSO I'M SURE THAT CORD OR WITH THE FREE BOTH FREIGHT. OPERATORS [inaudible] AND S THE SAN BERNARDINO SO -- TO LA UNION STATION A BUSY CORNER AT THIS POINT. THAT WATER KIND OF PROBLEMS WITHOUT. ONE ASSEMBLY DINO LINE IS OUR TOP PERFORMING LINE. PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM LOSANGELES METRO AND SENATOR DO YOU KNOW COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY PURCHASE THOSE RAIL RIGHTS AWAY FROM THE CLASS ONE RAILROADS SO IT'S PRINCIPALLY OWNED BY THE MEMBER AGENCIES RATHER THAN A PRIORITY FREIGHT CORRIDOR -- IS ABOUT THE OTHER TWO AGENCIES THE METRO AND CALTRAIN SO I'LL JUST PICK IT BACK ON STEPHANIE'S COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WE HAVE A LOT. SO FROM THE BURBANK TO UNION STATION SEGMENTS WE HAVE GRADE SEPARATIONS AND INVESTMENTS AND DOUBLE TRACKING -- WILL DEFINITELY HELP FACILITATE THAT IT'S THE READY BURKE IT'S ALREADY DOUBLE TRACK FROM BURBANK TO LOS ANGELES UNION STATION BUT FURTHER NORTH LIKE FROM PALMDALE WHERE HIGH SPEED RAIL DOESN'T TEND TO HAVE. IT CONNECTIVITY HUB UP IN THE NORTH AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- THAT WILL THAT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WITH OR ASKING TO LOOK INTO. ENHANCE INVESTMENTS IN THE RAIL CORRIDOR ALL THE WAY FROM PALM DEL DOWN TO BURBANK -- I EIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW HIGH SPEED RAIL AND WHERE THEY WANT TO CALM AS AN OPTION THAT WE ARE OPEN -- THAT WERE THAT WE HOPE THAT'S OPEN THAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO DOUBLE TRACKING THAT RAIL CORRIDOR THAT CAN BE USED MAYBE AS AN INTERIM OPERATING SEGMENT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL WHILE THE BILL TO MORE DEDICATED. HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR STILL TO BURBANK. YES FROM PALM DELTA BURBANK YES. AS A BEEN STUDIED. IT HAS BEEN STUDIED WE HAVE A A DOUBLE TRACKING PROJECT ROUGHLY FROM BURBANK TO GO FURTHER NORTH UP TO YOU. ON THE OUTSKIRTS LIMITS OF LOS ANGELES THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT'S A LITTLE OF AN MILE STRETCH. AND THEN WE WOULD NEED FURTHER DOUBLE TRACKING FROM THAT SEGMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO PALMDALE TO MAKE IT A FULL LEAD -- OF FOR HOPEFULLY DOUBLE TRACKED CORRIDOR [inaudible] CALTRAIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I GUESS TO THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE CALTRAIN SYSTEM WHERE I THINK -- FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL PURPOSES ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT WOULD BE NEEDED WHICH WOULD BE -- SUPPLEMENTAL TO OUR SERVICES. FIRST I'D LIKE TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES. OF RIGHT AWAY IN A CIVIL WORK BEING DONE -- IN OUR SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN IS A SYSTEM THAT WE OWN THE RIGHT AWAY OTHERS FIFTY TWO MILES. AND SO AS PART OF THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT M. THE INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE IS MAKING THROUGH HIGH SPEED RAIL -- AS A GRAND TOUR IN A AND TO US -- AMONG OTHER FUNDING AGENCIES -- HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IS RECEIVING A PROPERTY INTEREST IN. OUR RIGHT AWAY SO THAT IT WILL HAVE A PROPERTY RIGHT TO ACTUALLY. OPERATE. IT IS STILL AS I MENTIONED TO A SEPARATE PRODUCT A PROJECT THAT AS THE COURT SAID -- YET INTERESTINGLY WAS A VERY INTERESTING BUSINESS AND FACTUAL STATEMENT THE COURT SAID IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT A HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN CANNOT SIMPLY BE PLACED. ON ELECTRIFYING CALTRAIN TRACK. MANY OTHER CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REQUIRED. TO IMPLEMENT THE BLENDED SYSTEM IT BRING HIGH SPEED RAIL TO THE PENINSULA -- SHOWED IS A SEPARATE PROJECT BUT WE HAVE THE FOUNDATION BOB BY THE INVESTMENT IS BEING MADE AND ELECTRIFICATION. AND ON LIKE TO CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE NOT A CONTRACTOR PERFORMING WORK ON BEHALF OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS IS A PROJECT THIS GOT MULTIPLE FUNDERS. AND TOTAL COSTS FOR WHAT. WE AND OUR TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT -- APPROXIMATELY FOR ELECTRIFICATION BUT THE THREE AREAS I THINK THAT ARE OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO US IN HIGH SPEED RAIL ONE IS THAT SAN JOSE TO GILROY -- THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT DOES NOT EXTEND PAST SAN JOSE TO GILROY -- BUT IT WOULD BE IN THE MUTUAL INTEREST OF OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AND AND CALTRAIN FOREVER THE ELECTRIFICATION TO CURB WE RUN DIESEL SERVICE THERE. ON UNION PACIFIC TRACKS -- AND WE DO NOT OWN THAT RIGHT AWAY WE ARE -- THERE'S A TRACKAGE RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE SERVICES LIMITED IT IS NOT ELECTRIFIED SERVICE. AND WE KNOW FROM THE FROM THE LAST BUSINESSPLAN OF OF HIGH SPEED REALTORS AN EMPHASIS ON SAN JOSE. TO TO GO RIGHT COMPLETED THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION A PROPOSED THAT GO RIGHT OR CORRECT YES -- SO THAT'S ONE AREA WERE -- RIGHT HI WELL IT'S WE CAN WE CAN SERVE THAT WITHOUT ELECTRIFICATION WITHOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF A MUTUAL INTEREST. THE SECOND IS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT THE SAME AS A DIRT ON STATION THAT YOU'RE VERY. FAMILIAR WITH -- BY THE WITH THE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL COMING INTO SAN IS A WITH PART COMING INTO -- THE DO DIRT ON STATION AREA. WITH EXPANDED -- CALTRAIN SERVICE -- AND WITH THE MAJOR DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OCCURRING IN AROUND -- THAT STATION THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED -- END OF WE KNOW THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES SEPARATE APART FROM OF ALL THE OTHERS IT WILL THERE WILL HAVE TO BE AN INVESTMENT MADE. IN THAT STATE XIN. AND THERE'S A PLANNING PROCESS IN PLACE THAT INCLUDES MULTIPLE PARTIES. AND CLEAN UP HIGH SPEED RAIL CALTRAIN -- THE THE VALLEY TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION CITY SAN JOSE. TO WORK ON ON PLANNING FOR THAT STATION AREAS SO THAT'S AN AREA IN WHICH I I I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAW ACTUALLY WILL HAVE TO FIGHT THE FUNDS IT'S THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FOLKS WILL KNOW THAT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME. FUNDING REQUIREMENT AND THAT WILL BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND AND ALL THE PARTIES ARE JUST MENTION. IN THE THIRD AREA IS IN SAN FRANCISCO BY THE DOWNTOWN TERMINAL -- IN THE EXT EXTENSION FROM -- FOR THINKING STATION IN SAN FRANCISCO TO THE DOWNTOWN TERMINAL THAT'S OF INTEREST TO CALTRAIN TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- AND SO -- YOU THAT THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PROJECT -- THERE'S A PLANNING GOING ON IN THERE OR YOU JUST NEED TO BUILD EXTENSION. BY ALL RIGHT KIND OF THEIR YEAH IT SHOULD YEAH THIS KIND OF THEIR OWN. WE HAD A A STEEL BEAM THAT IDEA AND THEY JUST NEED TO BUILD THE THE EXTENSION IS IS A LITTLE OF AN UNDERSTATEMENT -- BUT IT WOULD BE A VERY COMPLEX -- BUT INTERESTING PROJECT IT'S IT'S OUR MUTUAL INTEREST AGAIN CALTRAIN -- DOESN'T HAVE TO EXTEND FROM FOR THINKING TO THE DOWNTOWN TERMINAL WE WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW LOTS OF TRAIN SERVICE TO SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE ARE BUT IT WOULD BE IN OUR INTEREST AS WELL FOR THEIR AN EXTENSION TO BE MADE. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT COME TO MIND IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. DO YOU ALL THINK THAT -- IF WE GET INTO THE NEXT. PHASE OF THE TRANSIT FUNDING -- THEY'RE ALL THESE PROJECTS WOULD ENHANCE THE ALL TWO MILLION HANDS THE RIDERSHIP. OF BOTH YOUR SYSTEMS AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOTH. YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE AB SO BOTH WOULD BENEFIT. IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP OF TAKING THE AIR POLLUTION NOW THERE'RE SO FORTH AND SO ON ABSOLUTELY OKAY -- CENTER STERN AS A QUESTION. SIR HENRY STERN. THANK YOU SENATOR. MISTER CHAIR. I'M SORRY I MISSED THE FRONT FIRST HALF YEAR YEAR HEARING I'M I'M JUST SHOWING UP FOR WHAT IN MY OPINION IS THE GOOD PART -- I TRULY THINK WITHIN YOUR AGENCIES AND THE INVESTMENTS WERE MAKING IT THESE BOOKENDS. THE ENTIRE. POLITICAL FORMULA FOR GETTING BUY IN FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL THE VOTERS TO APPROVE THESE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS AND ENDS TO ME YOU TALK ABOUT THE TWO MOST POPULOUS AREAS OF THE STATE SO I COMMEND YOU OFFER THE INTEGRATION YOUR EFFORTS AND I WANTED TO GET SOME CONFIRMATION THOUGH. BEFORE HAVE TO POP IN AND OUT. DO WE DID WE HEAR EARLIER IS THEIR COMMITMENT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE BOOK IN FUNDING FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ON THESE OUTSTANDING PROJECTS ON SCORE CALTRAIN -- MINE AND AND METRO THE RUN THROUGH TRACKS IF WE IF WE DO WE NEED TO RUN THAT TO GROUND HERE IS THAT. BEEN MADE CLEAR BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICER HR SORRY WILSON. NOT YET NO NO WE'LL SEE WHEN THE PRESENTER. OKAY IT'S IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN YOU CAN CREEK AND PANEL CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. IT'S IN THE CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN. BUT WHEN THEY PROPOSED ON THE REVISED -- UPGRADE BUSINESS PLAN IN MAY [inaudible] THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WILL SHOW AND ONE OF THE FOR THE SCARY FACTORS PROBABLY. IS THE NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES IT AWAY [inaudible] HOW WOULD? IMPACT THESE PROJECTS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND LAWS ARE CLEAN I I IT IN IN TERMS OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND IT IS THE SECRETARIES COMING TO JOIN OKAY GREAT. YEAH I THOUGHT I MIGHT BRING UP HERE TO GET SOCKED RIGHT HAVE A SEAT. YEAH THANK YOU IN TERMS OF THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR PROP ONE A FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT THERE WE HAVE IT AN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THOSE FUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH FACTUALLY STARTED DRAWING DOWN ON THOSE FUNDS. AND THE THE STATE HAS HAS INDICATED. THAT THE THOSE FUNDS ARE SEPARATE FROM -- ANY ISSUES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR THE FEDERAL FUNDS THOSE ARE NOT THOSE ARE. STATE FUNDS DOT FEDERAL FUNDS IN THAT AYE IMPACTED BY -- THE DISPUTE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MY HEAD BRIAN NUCLEAR ABSOLUTE RIGHT OUT OF STATE SECRETARY. OF TRANSPORTATION FOR YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WITH FAT -- THAT CLARIFIED THAT. TO YOU KNOW NOT ONLY CLEAR FIND THEY WERE STILL COMMITTED TO THESE EXISTING COMMITMENTS BUT AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE SOLD SOME BONDS -- EARLIER TODAY AND SOME OF THOSE BONDS I THINK WILL BE AVAILABLE TO JIM TO EXISTING AGREEMENTS FOR THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION AND WE'VE ALSO. COMPLETED THE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE ROSECRANS MARQUARDT PROJECT AND SO THOSE FUNDS AS WELL OR AVAILABLE TO THAT PROJECT AS IT MOVES FORWARD HIS IN. TO CLOSE THE LOOP AT THE UNION STATION WILL HAVE -- TO IS SAID GENET SAID THERE'S A FUNDING PLAN TO BE DONE WITH THAT PROJECT WHEN IT'S READY TO GO BUT THEY COMMITMENT REMAINS TO WELL THE BOOK AND PROJECTS AS WAS SAID -- STARTED IN TWENTY TWELVE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION OF MONEY FOR THOSE PURPOSES. WHAT'S THE TOTAL COST OF THE UNION STATION AND HOW MUCH REMAINS TO BE FUNDED AS THAT. IT MIGHT BE ARE YOU CLEARLY FUND -- INNER SO WE HAVE TO PHASES GO AHEAD SO THE FIRST PHASE IS THE RUN THREE PHASE YEAH SO THAT IS PARTIALLY THAT'S FULLY THAT WE HAVE. RECEIVED A FINING AWARD BY TERROR C. P.. WE HAVE FINING COMMENCEMENTS BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. TO APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE THE RATE CONSTANT SIGNALS AND BUILD A COMPLETE RUN FOR THIS. THE SECOND PHASE OF THAT IS RAISING THE RAIL YARD TO HAVE ALL PLATFORMS. BE RUN THROUGH CAPABILITY. AS WELL AS BUILDING A NEW PASSENGER CONCOURSE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AT UNION STATION THERE IS NO PASSENGER CONCOURSE YOU COME THROUGH EIGHT AN EXISTING TWENTY NINE FOOT PASSAGE WAY THAT WAS BUILT IN. NINETEEN THIRTY NINE AND SO THE INTENT IS TO TURN THIS INTO YOU USE. LEVERAGE THE LINKING AND STATION -- TO TO TRANSFORM IT TO A WORLD CLASS OF TRANSIT MOBILITY HUB -- FOR THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AGO TOOK EIGHTY YEARS WEST'S REVAMPING ANOTHER EIGHTY YEARS MORNING. SO THIS IS WHAT WILL IT BE FOR THE NEXT CD YEAR SO THAT. TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT IS ROUGHLY NORTH OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND ONLY NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PART OF PHASE A HAS HAD FINANCIAL COMMITMENT THAT'S THE ONE YOU HOPE TO GET DONE BY THE OLYMPICS ARE CORRECT. LET ME JUST SAY THANK YOU SECRETARY ANISE DEAD SINCERELY AND DON'T STOP THERE. THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE. SAID OLYMPICS TO BE HAD BUT ALSO HOW MANY MORE GRADE CROSSINGS DO WE HAVE WITH MARQUARDT TYPE -- THROUGH PUT ME TED. FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TROOPS TODAY. HOW MANY MORE LIKE THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER WE HAVE SEVERAL ONE WE HAVE DOOR ENDING GREAT DORK DOREEN AND BROADLY IN BRAZIL BETWEEN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND CITY OF GLENDALE? THAT'S ONE HAS IT IS COSTING THIS BUSY IS IN YOUR SET INTERESTED THAT'S A BUSY RAIL CORRIDOR BECAUSE WE BOTH HAVE THE LOW SAN CORD AROUND THE MATCHING LINKS WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE -- AMONG THEM METRO LINK. TO THE GOT THE SIGNS BUT YEAH NOTE THIS IS IN THIS IS AND THIS IS YOUR YOUR FIRST DAY. UP HERE RIGHT GRETA WELCOME IS WEEKENDS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THE NEW CEO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOU. THE IS THERE A LOT OF PHONE GRADE CROSSINGS FOR METROLINK ALSO YOU. YES WE HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS ROUTE MILE NETWORK AND UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF AT GRADE CROSSINGS ON SO YEAH. CALDERON BY WERE SMALL POTATOES COMPARED TO THAT BUT THE THERE'S A LOT WE HAVE IT JUST IN THE MAIN LINE WE HAVE FOR OVER. FORTY OKAY. SIR GALGIANI HAS SOME QUESTIONS SENATOR -- WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN IT WITH THE WHOLE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THERE WERE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED GRADE SEPARATIONS. ALONG THE WHOLE ENTIRE NORTH TO SOUTH CORRIDOR SO -- QUICK IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW QUICKLY EVERY DOLLAR OF HIGH SPEED RAIL DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT SIMPLY ON GRADE SEPARATIONS BECAUSE THE STATE HASN'T PROVIDED. ENOUGH FUNDING FOR GRADE SEPARATIONS BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND MEMBERS THAT THE WAY THAT PROP ONE IT WAS WRITTEN IS THAT. ANY MONEY THAT WE SPEND ESSENTIALLY HAS TO BE A COMMITMENT TO DO THAT CORD OR AS A USABLE CORD OR BECAUSE THE INTENTION WAS SO THAT WE WOULDN'T -- END UP USING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE ALL OVER THE STATE BUT RATHER. ANY PROJECT THAT WE COMMIT TO WE WOULD THEN HAVE THE INTENTION OF FOR FILLING THE ALL OF THE TRACK HAVE A HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION AT EACH END. SO WE COULD USE IT FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THEN THERE WAS -- GREATER WEIGHT WOULD BE GIVEN TO USABLE CORRIDORS THAT WOULD CONNECT WITH REGIONAL RAILS SO AT THIS POINT -- THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS COMMITTED. TO THE L. A. TO ANAHEIM SEGMENT IN MY VIEW BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE COMMITTED THE FUNDING FOR THE ROSE CRANS MARK WHAT GRADE SEPARATION. AND TO BE COMPLIANT WITH PROP ONE A WE NEED TO HAVE A USABLE. SEGMENT THE S. STATIONS AT EACH END EVENTUALLY. IT'S BURBANK RIGHT BURBANK TO ERA [inaudible] SO. YEAH THAT'S THE FOCUS. AND THROUGH THE MAIN STATION. SO GETTING THAT. OKAY -- WELL THANK YOU -- FOR THE PANEL ANDPUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT. HIGH SPEED RAIL -- WIN RIGHT TO PUBLIC TO COME FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF WE HAVE A MICROPHONE WE WANT TO HAVE EVERYBODY -- A CHANCE TO MAKE COMMENTS -- TWO MINUTES A PIECE OF ALL TIME YOU KNOW. AND WELCOME TO OUR HEARING. GOOD EVENING SIR -- MAN THANK YOU -- TO DO THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR I WILL MOVE THIS ALONG BUT THANK YOU TERMS BELL AND CHAIRMAN OF Y. KOWSKI AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME STEVE KERR AGAIN. ON THE CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY MERCED I'M HERE TODAY OR THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF MAYOR MURPHY WHO'S ON A LONG OVERDUE VACATION. MERCED HEARD IS THAT MISTREATED SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S RURAL RESILIENCE STRATEGY WHICH INCLUDES IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION IN THE HEART OF CALIFORNIA THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A KEY ELEMENT TO THAT STRATEGY PROVIDING A COMMITMENT TO CLEAN LOW AND NO CARBON TRANSPORTATION. STRATEGIES THAT HELP REDUCE POLLUTION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOME TO SOME OF THE NATION'S WORST AIR QUALITY AND HIGHEST ASTHMA RATES. WE'RE SAID FRESNO BIGGEST FILTER ON GENERALLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES MERCED FRESNO AND KERN. AND THEY HAVE A POPULATION X. THE IN EXCESS OF TWO MILLION PEOPLE. THE CITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AMONG THE SIX CALIFORNIA'S FASTEST GROWING COMMUNITIES RIGHT WITH OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY CALIFORNIA INTO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. THE GOVERNOR'S HIGH SPEED RAIL PROPOSAL IS TRANSFORMED OF FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY CAN TRAVEL TIME AND HAVE TO MOVE BETWEEN CITIES THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY. COMPARED TO TODAY'S RAIL SERVICE IN TRAVELING BY CAR WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TRANSFORMED IT FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT MAINTAINS IMPORTANT TARGET INVESTMENTS. ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITY AND THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES OPENING OF VALLEY TO VALLEY ACCESS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPANIES TO EXPAND TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND OFFERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROSPECTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL GOALS TO ENSURE STATEWIDE COORDINATED INVESTMENTS. HIGH SPEED RAIL ALSO CONNECTS MERCED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE MEGA REGION EFFORTS FROM THE BAY AREA PROVIDING A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO HOW WE ADDRESS HOUSING WORKFORCE AND EDUCATIONAL ISSUES. THIS INCLUDES LEVERAGING STATE INVESTMENTS AND DYNAMIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS UC MERCED. AND FINALLY THE THE CITY MERCED HAS BEEN AND REMAINS SUPPORT OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL LOOKS FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP IN DOING ITS PART TO RIDE TO SOLUTIONS TO CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM CHALLENGES. THANK YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. FORMER SAID THANKS FOR COMING ALL THIS LONG WAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE KEITH ON HER BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED TRAINS MADE UP OF BUSINESS AND LABOR GROUPS WHO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT FROM BEGINNING. I'LL BE BRIEF AND JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NATURE OF SOME THE CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE TODAY AND THIS REALLY IS A TRANSFORMATIVE INNOVATIVE. PROCESS TO MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT AS YOU HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES TODAY THIS IS. TRANSFORMING IN MODERNIZING OUR TRAIN SYSTEM WHICH SERVES ALL OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALSO THE CENTER STONE I'M SORRY HE'S NOT HERE BECAUSE TALKING ABOUT THE AIRPORTS. IN FLIGHT TRAVEL WITHIN OUR STATE IN CALIFORNIA IS RESTRICTED AND LIMITED DUE TO NUMEROUS THINGS BUT MILITARY BASES OTHER ACTS AB. LIMITATIONS ON AIR TRAVEL THE STATE SO WE'RE BUILDING THE SYSTEM FOR THE FUTURE WE HAVE CONGESTION IN THE CARS WHICH WE SEE BUT WE ALSO FORGET ABOUT CONGESTION IN THE ERRORS. ADDITIONAL AIRSPACE IS NOT AN OPTION HERE IN THE STATE AND IN IN INNOVATING OUR TRAINING TRAVEL WITHIN THE STATE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IS GOING TO HELP THE SKIES AS WELL. I'M LET MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE BUILDING TRADES MISTER SMITH TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMICS AND JOB CREATION OF THIS PROJECT BUT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WAS A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT RIGHT AT THE TIME THAT WE NEEDED IT. AND WE'RE JUST COMPLETELY SUPPORTER OF THIS PROJECT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS I THINK WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM ON BOARD -- WHO ARE GONNA MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS BUT MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING IN THE OPPORTUNITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO BOTH CHAIRS HERE TODAY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- AS POINTED OUT IN THE WHITE PAPER CREATED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE LAST PAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THOUSANDS OF JOBS. IN -- WORKER HOURS THAT HAVE ALREADY -- BEEN PUT INTO PLACE IN THIS JOB NOT NOT TO MENTION A TRANSFORMATIVE. ECONOMIC INVESTMENT IN THE AREAS OF THE STATE WHAT IS HAPPENING PARTICULAR THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- BUT OUTSIDE OF THE ECONOMIC THE POSITIVE TO THIS PROJECT -- IT'S THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION OF THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WE NEED TO KEEP AT THE FOREVER MINE FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW IT'S CENTRAL TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION GOALS. THAT WE HAVE -- PROMOTED IN THE STATE. IT'S ALSO CENTRAL TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND IT IS ESSENTIAL ANSWER TO THAT. IF WE CAN MOVE PEOPLE FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO WHERE THE JOBS ARE -- THAT IS GOING TO HELP FIX THAT CRISIS AS WELL IN FACT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE A GREEN NEW DEAL. THEN YOU NEED TO SUPPORT A PROJECT LIKE THIS. BECAUSE THIS GETS AT THE HEART OF WHAT IS IS -- PROVIDING A LOT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF THE STATE AND THAT'S VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ARE GETTING CARS OFF THE ROAD IS GOING TO HELP US MEET OUR GOALS. UNDER AB THIRTY TWO AND THE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION. AND IF -- THE LEGISLATURE SPOKE ABOUT BY PASSING AB THIRTY TWO IT. ALSO SAID WE WANT TO BE BELIEVE IN THESE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS. THAT ARE GONNA SOLVE THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS AND IN SITUATION. THOSE PROJECTS ARE BIG AND COSTLY AND TAKE A LONG TIME TO FINISH WHAT THEY'RE VITAL. TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS AND TO FIX THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE. AND SO FINALLY I WOULD SAY WE SUPPORT THE PROJECT MOVING FORWARD CONTINUOUS IT IS -- WITH THE CONTINUED ROBUST OVERSIGHT. I NOT ONLY OF THE TWO COMMITTEES REPRESENTED HERE TODAY -- BUT THERE -- THE COMMITTEES IN THE US ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS WELL IN THE PEER REVIEW GROUP THIS IS A BIG PROJECT -- IT'S GOING WE THINK WELL -- COULD ALWAYS BE IMPROVED EVERY BIG PROJECT ALWAYS BE IMPROVED BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE NEED TO CONTINUE FOR ON THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S VITAL TO THE STATE'S. ECONOMIC IN -- CLIMATE CHANGE INTERESTS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR ARE BOTH CHAIRS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT AND CENTER GALGIANI TO THIS PROJECT -- JOE CRUISE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROJECT -- BUT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS A REALLY VIABLE SEGMENT OF THE VALLEY TO VALLEY PIECE WHICH CONNECTS. A RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH GOOD JOBS IN THE SILICON VALLEY -- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY A COUPLE OF OF SORT OF FUNDING ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THERE WE WOULD WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEEK FUNDING FOR IN THAT ONE IS THE CALTRANS ELECTRIFICATION. THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE RAIL LINE AND ALSO THE UPGRADES TO THE ROLLING STOCK -- WE WOULD ALSO -- RESPECT THE REQUEST THAT THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH INCLUDING GRADE SEPARATIONS AT SKY WAY BRAND HAND. AND SIGNED OFF IN THE FINAL E. I. R. E. I. S. -- CAN MISTER MISTER HARNICK -- TOUCHED UPON A COUPLE OTHER ITEMS ONE IS THE ACQUISITION OF VITAL RIGHT AWAY ALONG THE UNION PACIFIC RAIL CORRIDOR FOR THE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE RAIL LINE FURTHER. ON PASSED GILROY WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP IN THE OVERALL PROJECT. AND THEN LASTLY -- AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN MEMBER AGENCIES -- THE CITY OF SAN JOSE VC A CALTRANS AT HIM TO SEE.

LOCKED BEHIND A GREAT BAND FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES HAD TO GO THROUGH THE HOT CHICK PEAS WEATHER SNOW ON THE GROUND ALL KINDS OF STUFF.
