01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:53.993
DREDGED UP I MEAN IF SOMEBODY

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:57.630

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:41.541
POLICE OFFICERS APPLY FOR A JOB

01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:43.977
OR CONTINUE TO SERVE. IF

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:46.212
THEY'RE NOT CONVICTED CORRECTLY

01:54:46.279 --> 01:54:48.915

I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS THE

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:10.737
CRITERIA FOR THE AUDIT. AND

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:11.704

IN AGING SO THANK YOU FOR

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.106
BRINGING THESE POINTS AS WELL.

01:56:20.173 --> 01:56:21.240
IN FACT I WAS GOING TO PUT IT

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:22.975
INTO THREE CATEGORIES THE FIRST

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:24.310
ONE MISTER CHARITY ANSWERED SO

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:25.745
I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT THAT.

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:27.847
THE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS-

01:56:27.914 --> 01:56:29.082
THINGS FROM PAST CAN BE USED

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:31.684
AGAINST YOU WHAT IF THE IN TWO

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:33.086
WHAT IF THE INDIVIDUAL LEFT THE

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:35.288
GROUP. THAT THEY HAD JOINT OKAY

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:36.889
AND THEN THREE TATTOOS WHAT IF

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:38.391
IT WAS DONE IN THE YOUTH I'M

01:56:38.458 --> 01:56:39.525
PARAPHRASING BUT I THINK I

01:56:39.592 --> 01:56:41.561
CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF IT. I'LL

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:43.596
BE VERY CANDID WITH YOU- I AND

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:45.898
I GUESS THE SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:48.634
OF FORGIVENESS. MY GOAL. ISN'T

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:49.936
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE OF US

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:54.140
WHO. ARE WANTING TO LOOK INTO.

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:57.810
THE THIS BIT THE UNDERLYING

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.879
ISSUE NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS BUT

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:01.247
THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF WHAT'S

01:57:01.314 --> 01:57:04.217
WRONG. ARE NOT GOING TO WORRY

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:07.086
ABOUT THESE ISOLATED INCIDENTS

01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:10.990
MY GOAL IS. WHEN CERTAIN ISSUES

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:14.861
ARE NOT ADDRESSED. THEY START

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:15.428
FOSTERING A CULTURE OF THEIR

01:57:15.495 --> 01:57:18.331
OWN. WHEN WE HAVE A CULTURE

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:20.299
WITHIN A DEPARTMENT THAT'S

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:23.269
DANGEROUS THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO

01:57:23.336 --> 01:57:23.870
BE ROOTED OUT BECAUSE THAT'S A

01:57:23.936 --> 01:57:27.974
CANCER. WE DON'T WANT THAT

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.909
CANCER TO BE MALIGNANT AND

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:32.478
SPREAD AND CONTINUED TO

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:35.348
DEVASTATE OTHER FUNCTIONS. I

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:36.382
CAN SHARE WITH YOU MY OWN

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:38.885
EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN A VERY

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:40.987
LONG TIME RESIDENT OF LA CITY.

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:42.488
HAVE HARDLY GOTTEN PULLED OVER

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:44.424
IN THE CITY OF LA BUT WHEN I GO

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:47.093
TO A NEIGHBORING CITY. I KEPT I

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.328
KEPT ON GETTING PULLED OVER I

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:50.062
EVEN GOT PULLED OVER AS A

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:56.002
STAFFER WITH EMPTY PLATE. THERE

01:57:56.068 --> 01:58:00.440
IS BIAS. AND I'VE EXPERIENCED

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:02.041
THAT MYSELF BY THE WAY THAT

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.476
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:05.178
NOT PART OF THIS AUDIT BECAUSE

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:07.046
I'M NOT A **** FOR TAT GUY I'M

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:08.648
NOT TRYING TO GO AFTER SOMEONE

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:09.816
FROM MY PAST THAT'S DONE

01:58:09.882 --> 01:58:11.617
SOMETHING MY GOAL. IS TO ROOT

01:58:11.684 --> 01:58:16.889
OUT. THE CANCER THAT TAKES HOLD

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:19.258
AND BECOMES A CULTURE ONCE AND

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:22.128
WE'VE HAD THAT HAPPEN SO OFTEN

01:58:22.195 --> 01:58:23.463
AND IT'S GONE ON UNCHECKED FOR

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:26.299
SO LONG THAT NOW WE'RE SEEING

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:28.768
MORE AND MORE INCIDENTS AND

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:29.402
THEN UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.038
IS. INCIDENTS THAT RIGHTFULLY

01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:34.874
TAKE PLACE CAUGHT ON CAMERA GET

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.809
BLURRED WITH INCIDENTS THAT

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:38.744
SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND

01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:42.315
IT BECOMES. A VERY DIFFICULT

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:44.183
ISSUE TO DISTINGUISH AND YOU

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:45.485
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO LOOK

01:58:45.551 --> 01:58:47.386
BACK AND SEE WHAT THE CONTEXT

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:50.056
OF IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:51.924
WHY IT PRECIPITATED INTO WHAT

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:55.027
IT BECAME. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:56.863
INDIVIDUAL ISSUES THIS IS ABOUT

01:58:56.929 --> 01:58:58.798
A CULTURE THAT TAKES HOLD OF A

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:01.300
DEPARTMENT AND IS FOSTERED AND

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.835
IT GOES GENERATION FROM

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:04.437
GENERATION AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.205
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:08.541
I DO BELIEVE THAT A MAN OF YOUR

02:08:33.939 --> 02:08:34.807

ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR ANOTHER

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:08.126
SET OF EYES. TO SAY. THAT WE

02:26:08.192 --> 02:26:10.962
ARE DOING IT RIGHT. WE CAN USE

02:26:11.028 --> 02:26:11.696

AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE

02:26:21.973 --> 02:26:26.077
CRUX OF THIS IS. ONE OF I'M

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:27.678
OVER ME JUST ON MY OWN TIME

02:26:27.745 --> 02:26:29.814
COMMON APPRECIATE THAT AND I

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:31.549
THINK THAT. THAT PART OF THE

02:26:31.616 --> 02:26:33.618
PROBLEM I WAS BUDGET CHAIR IN

02:26:33.684 --> 02:26:36.654
THIS CHAMBER FOR A MOD TWO

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:38.289
THOUSAND FORTY EIGHT. AND A LOT

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:40.591
OF THE- INSTITUTIONS WERE

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:43.427
CLOSED DOWN AT THE TIME 80% OF

02:26:43.494 --> 02:26:47.398
THE MONEY. WANT 220% OF THE

02:26:47.465 --> 02:26:49.867
RECIPIENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONS

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:54.238
AND- ARE 20% OF THE MONEY WENT

02:26:54.305 --> 02:26:56.240
280% OF THE RECIPIENTS IN THE

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:58.643
LOCAL PROGRAMS AND YET. WHEN

02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:00.511
THE HOSPITALS WERE CLOSED DOWN

02:27:00.578 --> 02:27:02.346
THE SAVINGS FROM THE MONEY

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:04.482
DIDN'T SHIFT TO THE LOCAL

02:27:04.549 --> 02:27:07.985
PROGRAMS. AND THE SO I THINK

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:10.755
PART OF THIS IS. IT IS THE

02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:12.190
RESOURCES AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN

02:27:12.256 --> 02:27:14.859
ALLOCATED BUT- I'M ON THE GO

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:18.696
WITH YOUR- SUGGESTION THAT ARE-

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:20.064
WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT EYES WE

02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:21.566
LOOK AT IT AND IF PART OF THE

02:27:21.632 --> 02:27:23.534
RECOMMENDATION IS MONEY. THEN

02:27:23.601 --> 02:27:25.603
IT WAS WE KNOW THAT THAT SAID

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:27.638
OF PART OF IT IS THAT THE

02:27:27.705 --> 02:27:29.040
SERVICES COULD BE DELIVERED

02:27:29.106 --> 02:27:30.608
BETTER WITH THE EXISTING MONEY

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:34.378
THEN WE WOULD GET AT THAT SO-

02:27:34.445 --> 02:27:35.913
THIS THE- THAT. THERE MIGHT BE

02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:37.381
SOME REDUNDANCIES IN HERE I

02:27:37.448 --> 02:27:39.116
THINK IT'S WORTH GOING AHEAD

02:27:39.183 --> 02:27:40.918
WITH WHAT PRESHEAF HAD ONE OF

02:27:40.985 --> 02:27:42.386

YEAR THESE ISSUES. HAVE ONLY

GOTTEN WORSE AS A RESULT OF

02:57:00.409 --> 02:57:02.011
MANY CALIFORNIANS LOSING THEIR

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:07.283
SECURE. WE'VE MADE MANY STEPS

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:08.884
AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO

02:57:08.951 --> 02:57:11.554
ADDRESS THIS WITH A RECENT VOTE

02:57:11.620 --> 02:57:14.757
ON A RED MORATORIUM. WE ALSO

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:16.092
KNOW THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:57:16.158 --> 02:57:17.493
THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY

02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:20.129
IN THIS AUDIT INTERSECT AS WITH

02:57:27.470 --> 02:57:29.672
LOOKING IN THE FUTURE WITH THE

02:57:29.739 --> 02:57:31.774
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT

02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:33.376
POTENTIALLY WILL MOVE FROM

BEING HOUSED TO HOMELESS ARE

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:38.681
TOO MANY TO COUNT. AND SO WHEN

02:57:38.748 --> 02:57:40.750
WE LOOK AT STATE PROPERTY STATE

02:57:40.816 --> 02:57:43.352
SURPLUS PROPERTY BUT WE HAVE

02:57:43.419 --> 02:57:48.190
SEEN AND EVAN FLOW JUST IN

02:57:48.257 --> 02:57:48.791
TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN I SAT ON

02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:51.427
ACCOUNTABILITY. COMMITTEE WE

02:57:51.494 --> 02:57:53.963
ARE ACTUALLY JUST REMOVING PART

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:56.132
PROPERTIES FROM THE ROLES NOW

02:57:56.198 --> 02:57:59.535
WE FIND OURSELVES. IN A CRISIS

02:57:59.602 --> 02:58:00.970
AND EVERY PIECE OF LAND IS

02:58:01.037 --> 02:58:04.173
VALUABLE WE KNOW HOUSING PRICES

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:04.940
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF HEALTH

02:58:05.007 --> 02:58:07.076
CALIFORNIA ARE THE HIGHEST

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:10.179
THEY'VE EVER BEEN. SO WHEN WE

02:58:10.246 --> 02:58:12.114
LOOK AT SURPLUS PROPERTY IT'S

02:58:12.181 --> 02:58:13.983
OUR DUTY TO NOT ONLY TAKE

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:16.852
INVENTORY BUT TO AUDIT IT TO

02:58:16.919 --> 02:58:20.890
FIND OUT WHY WHEN CALIFORNIANS.

02:58:20.956 --> 02:58:23.025
THE ONE THING THEY DO AGREE ON.

02:58:23.092 --> 02:58:25.461
AND IS VERY CONTESTED PERIOD IS

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:27.329
THAT WERE NOT DOING ENOUGH

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:29.665
REGARDING HOMELESSNESS. THAT WE

02:58:29.732 --> 02:58:34.603
ARE NOT. HOUSING PEOPLE THAT WE

02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:36.939
ARE NOT BUILDING. AND THAT WE

02:58:37.006 --> 02:58:38.808
ARE FAILING WITH SOME OF OUR

02:58:38.874 --> 02:58:41.544
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:43.679
FORWARD TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.

02:58:43.746 --> 02:58:45.414
SO WITH THAT WE HAVE MORE THAN

02:58:45.481 --> 02:58:47.216
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE

02:58:47.283 --> 02:58:48.984
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW

02:58:49.051 --> 02:58:50.019
THAT ARE EXPERIENCING

02:58:50.086 --> 02:58:52.588
HOMELESSNESS 27% OF

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:53.322
CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS

02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:55.558
POPULATION IS CHRONICALLY

02:58:55.624 --> 02:58:57.726
HOMELESS. JUST IN MY COUNTY OF

02:58:57.793 --> 02:59:01.297

SPACES BENCHES BUS STOPS PARKS

02:59:11.006 --> 02:59:12.374
THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL THAT

02:59:12.441 --> 02:59:14.743
THE STATE IDENTIFY AND SELL

02:59:14.810 --> 02:59:16.645

COATED IN THE PANDEMIC. AND AS

02:59:51.247 --> 02:59:54.049
YOU MIGHT GUESS WE HAVE SEEN

02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:58.921

THOSE ARE SUITABLE FOR HOUSING.

03:00:15.237 --> 03:00:17.673
BUT WE KNOW A MINUTE AMOUNT

03:22:42.316 --> 03:22:43.951
DASHBOARD THEY WERE RELEASED

TWO YEARS AGO. AND RECENTLY

03:22:46.621 --> 03:22:48.289

03:22:48.356 --> 03:22:50.858
US TO EVALUATE THE FINANCES. OF

03:22:50.925 --> 03:22:52.527

THE PROGRAM GOING IN TWO

03:23:00.201 --> 03:23:01.969
THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WE'VE REALLY

03:23:02.036 --> 03:23:04.038
BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCES

03:23:04.105 --> 03:23:06.107
OUT OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND.

03:23:06.173 --> 03:23:09.277
AND SPECIFICALLY- SINCE WE

03:23:09.343 --> 03:23:10.444
ESTABLISHED THE DASH FOR THE

03:23:10.511 --> 03:23:12.046
CITY OF RICHMOND HAS REALLY

03:23:12.113 --> 03:23:14.348
BEEN MOVING UP OUR LIST. OF

03:23:14.415 --> 03:23:16.417
CITIES THAT ARE OUR MOST

03:23:16.484 --> 03:23:17.685
FISCALLY CHALLENGED IN THE

03:23:17.752 --> 03:23:20.421
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN OUR

03:23:20.488 --> 03:23:21.656
MOST RECENT UPDATE TO THE

03:23:21.722 --> 03:23:23.391
DASHBOARD IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY

03:23:23.457 --> 03:23:25.960
TWENTY. RICHMOND MOVED UP TO

03:23:26.027 --> 03:23:27.562
THE FIFTH MOST FISCALLY

03:23:27.628 --> 03:23:29.397
CHALLENGED CITY IN THE STATE.

03:23:29.463 --> 03:23:30.464
AND BASICALLY WHAT IT COMES

03:23:30.531 --> 03:23:31.933
DOWN TO IS THE CITY IS REALLY

03:23:31.999 --> 03:23:34.535
LACKING. SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL

03:23:34.602 --> 03:23:36.637
RESERVES. AND IT REALLY HAS A

03:23:36.704 --> 03:23:38.172
COMPROMISED ABILITY TO PAY ITS

03:23:38.239 --> 03:23:40.575
LONG TERM DEBTS. INCLUDING

03:23:40.641 --> 03:23:45.580
SIGNIFICANT UNFUNDED.

03:23:45.646 --> 03:23:46.147
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE

03:23:46.213 --> 03:23:46.781
OTHER THING THAT WE FOR TROUBLE

03:23:46.847 --> 03:23:48.950
IS. THE CITY IS A HOW TO HARD

03:23:49.016 --> 03:23:51.285
TIME BALANCING ITS BUDGET OVER

03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:53.354
THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. FOR

03:23:53.421 --> 03:23:56.357
EXAMPLE TOWARDS FISCAL YEAR

03:23:56.424 --> 03:23:57.391
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SLASH TWENTY

03:23:57.458 --> 03:23:59.927
TWO BUDGET. THE CITY HAD TO USE

03:23:59.994 --> 03:24:02.296
OUR- FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:24:02.363 --> 03:24:04.198
STAINLESS MONEY THAT EXPECTS TO

03:24:04.265 --> 03:24:05.299
RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL

03:24:05.366 --> 03:24:07.234
GOVERNMENT TO REALLY BALANCE

03:24:07.301 --> 03:24:08.569
ITS BUDGET WITHOUT THAT THE

03:24:08.636 --> 03:24:09.937
CITY HAD A HOLD ITS TWENTY

03:24:10.004 --> 03:24:12.139
TWENTY. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

03:24:12.206 --> 03:24:14.408
BUDGET. THE OTHER THING IS WE

03:24:14.475 --> 03:24:15.710
KNOW THAT THE CITY OF RICHMOND

03:24:15.776 --> 03:24:17.478
HAS RECENTLY HIRED MANAGEMENT

03:24:17.545 --> 03:24:19.347
CONSULTANTS AMERICAN SOLDIERS

03:24:19.413 --> 03:24:20.615
COME UP WITH A TEN YEAR

03:24:20.681 --> 03:24:22.783
FINANCIAL FORECAST. AND NOT

03:24:22.850 --> 03:24:24.785
FORECAST PROJECTS AT THE CITY'S

03:24:24.852 --> 03:24:26.520
GENERAL FUND IS GONNA BE

03:24:26.587 --> 03:24:28.723
STARTING TO RUN A DEFICIT IN

03:24:28.789 --> 03:24:33.694
JUST A FEW YEARS BY FISCAL YEAR.

03:24:33.761 --> 03:24:34.261
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND

03:24:34.328 --> 03:24:35.363
BASICALLY THAT'S HAPPENING

03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:36.530
BECAUSE THE CITY IS

03:24:36.597 --> 03:24:38.766
EXPENDITURES ARE PROJECTED TO

03:24:38.833 --> 03:24:40.635
GROW MORE RAPIDLY THAN ITS

03:24:40.701 --> 03:24:43.104
REVENUES. IT PUTS STRESS

03:24:43.170 --> 03:24:49.343
FINANCES. AND SO JUST TO WALK

03:24:49.410 --> 03:24:51.078
THROUGH THE KEY OBJECTIVES IN

03:24:51.145 --> 03:24:53.247
OUR OUR PROPOSAL VERY QUICKLY

03:24:53.314 --> 03:24:54.515
IF THE ARTS APPROVED WHAT WE

03:24:54.582 --> 03:24:56.217
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A DEEP

03:24:56.283 --> 03:24:58.653
DIVE INTO THE CITY'S FINANCES

03:24:58.719 --> 03:25:00.121
PROGRAM ASSESS ITS CURRENT

03:25:00.187 --> 03:25:02.156
FINANCIAL CONDITION WE'RE GONNA

03:25:02.223 --> 03:25:03.791
TAKE A LOOK AT ITS ABILITY TO

03:25:03.858 --> 03:25:05.993
PAY ITS BILLS BOTH IN THE SHORT

03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:08.162
TERM AND THE LONG TERM WE'RE

03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:10.064
GONNA IDENTIFY REALLY THE ROOT

03:25:10.131 --> 03:25:11.832
CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL

03:25:11.899 --> 03:25:13.801
CHALLENGES THE CITY OF RICHMOND

03:25:13.868 --> 03:25:15.836
HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING. FOR

03:25:15.903 --> 03:25:18.339
QUITE SOME TIME WE'RE ALSO

03:25:18.406 --> 03:25:20.174
GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

03:25:20.241 --> 03:25:22.009
CITY'S BUDGETING PRACTICES

03:25:22.076 --> 03:25:22.977
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR

03:25:23.044 --> 03:25:24.512
FINANCIAL FORECASTS OF AN

03:25:24.578 --> 03:25:26.914
ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF

03:25:26.981 --> 03:25:28.649
THE OF THE PROJECTIONS BOARDS

03:25:28.716 --> 03:25:32.186
REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND

03:25:32.253 --> 03:25:33.154
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO TAKE A LOOK

03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:34.422
AT THE CITY'S PROCESS

03:25:34.488 --> 03:25:36.657
PROCESSING FEES WE WANT TO MAKE

03:25:36.724 --> 03:25:39.260
SURE THE CITY SETTING PLEASE AN

03:25:39.326 --> 03:25:40.828
APPROPRIATE MANNER THAT COVERS

03:25:40.895 --> 03:25:43.564
THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES.

03:25:43.631 --> 03:25:45.900
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:47.535
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL DO

03:25:47.601 --> 03:25:50.037
IS TAKE A LOOK AT ANY OTHER

03:25:50.104 --> 03:25:51.272
ARTS HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE

03:25:51.338 --> 03:25:52.840
CITY'S EXTERNAL FINANCIAL

03:25:52.907 --> 03:25:54.775
AUDITORS WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK

03:25:54.842 --> 03:25:55.810
AT WHAT THEY'RE MANAGEMENT

03:25:55.876 --> 03:25:57.511
CONSULTANT HAS DONE AND WE'RE

03:25:57.578 --> 03:25:59.480
NOT GOING TO DUPLICATE ANY OF

03:25:59.547 --> 03:26:01.215
THAT WORK BUT WE WILL TAKE A

03:26:01.282 --> 03:26:02.483
LOOK AT IT AND WE'RE GONNA

03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:04.051
FOLLOW UP TO SEE WHAT WITHIN

03:26:04.118 --> 03:26:06.454
CITY HAS ACTUALLY MOVED FORWARD

03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:11.392
WITH IMPLEMENTING. ANY OF THOSE

03:26:11.459 --> 03:26:12.226
RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT I THINK OF.

03:26:12.293 --> 03:26:12.860
IF THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THIS

03:26:12.927 --> 03:26:14.261
OP. WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR'S

03:26:14.328 --> 03:26:16.597
OFFICE IS GOING TO PROVIDE. IS

03:26:16.664 --> 03:26:19.233
REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE. LISTING

03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:21.769
OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN

03:26:21.836 --> 03:26:23.370
PROVIDE A BLUE PRINT. FOR THE

03:26:23.437 --> 03:26:24.939
CITY OF RICHMOND TO REALLY TURN

03:26:25.005 --> 03:26:26.907
AROUND ITS FINANCES ITS

03:26:26.974 --> 03:26:29.276

03:26:31.812 --> 03:26:33.881
ROBUST PROCESS IN PLACE THAT

03:26:33.948 --> 03:26:35.483
WILL ALLOW US TO MONITOR THE

03:26:35.549 --> 03:26:37.685
CITY'S EFFORTS. TO IMPLEMENT A

03:26:37.752 --> 03:26:39.687
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN IN AS A

03:26:39.754 --> 03:26:41.255

03:26:41.322 --> 03:26:43.324
LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WHERE

03:26:43.390 --> 03:26:44.225

03:26:44.291 --> 03:26:46.393
SOLUTION AND WILL BE THERE TO

03:34:44.738 --> 03:34:46.907
BILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN I DID

03:34:46.974 --> 03:34:49.343
PROP BUT SB SIXTEEN WHICH WAS

03:34:49.409 --> 03:34:50.911

ANOTHER ONE PASSED IT YOU KNOW-

03:35:08.929 --> 03:35:11.798
SHOULD TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO

03:35:11.865 --> 03:35:13.066
FUND THE SCHOOLS. AND SO WHAT'S

03:35:13.133 --> 03:35:14.801
HAPPENED HAS BEEN THERE'S BEEN

03:35:14.868 --> 03:35:17.037
A QUESTION BROADLY SPEAKING

03:35:17.104 --> 03:35:19.439
BROADLY SPEAKING THAT AS A

03:35:19.506 --> 03:35:21.275
RESULT THERE HAS BEEN. THE BILL

03:35:21.341 --> 03:35:22.776
GROUP ENROLLMENT GROWTH HAS

03:35:22.843 --> 03:35:25.245
DRAMATICALLY SLOWED ACROSS THE

03:35:25.312 --> 03:35:27.347
STATE THE RECENT YEARS. IT IS

03:35:27.414 --> 03:35:29.216
DECLINING IN MANY COMMUNITIES

03:35:29.283 --> 03:35:31.218
AND THE EMPHASIS BY THE STATE

03:35:31.285 --> 03:35:33.353
FACILITIES PROGRAM HAS SHIFTED

03:35:33.420 --> 03:35:34.655
FROM CONSTRUCTION OF NEW

03:35:34.721 --> 03:35:36.256
FACILITIES TO MODERNIZATION AND

03:35:36.323 --> 03:35:37.891
REHABILITATION OF EXISTING

WHICH ARE USED TO SERVE ON

03:35:45.732 --> 03:35:47.668
FOUND THAT 38% OF CALIFORNIA

03:35:47.734 --> 03:35:48.835
STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOLS THAT

03:35:48.902 --> 03:35:50.070
DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM FACILITY

03:35:50.137 --> 03:35:51.672
STANDARDS. THERE WAS ALSO A

03:35:51.738 --> 03:35:54.741
STUDY. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

03:35:54.808 --> 03:35:55.976

INEQUITABLE FACILITIES IN A TWO

03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:00.380
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY BY

03:36:00.447 --> 03:36:02.082
STANFORD UNIVERSITY SIMILAR

03:36:02.149 --> 03:36:04.418
CONCLUSIONS. AND SO THE

03:36:04.484 --> 03:36:07.554
QUESTION BECOMES AS WE EMBARK

03:36:07.621 --> 03:36:10.324
ON ON THE NEXT STEP. ALL OF

03:36:10.390 --> 03:36:11.591
SCHOOL FACILITIES FINANCING

03:36:11.658 --> 03:36:12.826
WHICH WE HAVE TO DO WHICH I

03:36:12.893 --> 03:36:15.429
FUNDAMENTALLY SUPPORT. WE NEED

03:36:15.495 --> 03:36:18.332
DATA AND I WANT TO I WANT YOU

03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:19.599
KNOW MENTION THIS IN MY CLOTHES

03:36:19.666 --> 03:36:22.502
ON. TO NARROW THE TERM I WAS

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:25.005
TOLD BY THE AUDITOR WAS

03:36:25.072 --> 03:36:27.240
DETERMINES DOWN SCOPE THE AUDIT

03:36:27.307 --> 03:36:29.009
JUST TO DEAL WITH MODERNIZATION

03:36:29.076 --> 03:36:31.745
NUMBER ONE. AND TWO TO ASK FOR

03:36:31.812 --> 03:36:32.746
URGENCY IF THAT'S THE RIGHT

03:36:32.813 --> 03:36:35.382
TERM SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS

03:36:35.449 --> 03:36:37.984
DONE IN TIME THAT THE

03:36:38.051 --> 03:36:40.887
LEGISLATURE'S EDUCATED. WHAT

03:36:40.954 --> 03:36:42.322
ARE THE STUDIES SHOW. IS THERE

03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:44.191
A REAL ISSUE OR NOT IF IT IS

03:36:44.257 --> 03:36:46.093
WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUE.

03:36:46.159 --> 03:36:48.261
AND THEN INCORPORATE THAT IN

03:36:48.328 --> 03:36:49.963
OUR HOUSE AND TWENTY TWO

03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.897
EFFORTS OR ANY OTHER EFFORTS

03:36:50.964 --> 03:36:54.000
BEYOND. SO THAT THE BOTTOM LINE

03:36:54.067 --> 03:36:56.303
OF OUR BODIES LEGISLATURE. IS

03:36:56.370 --> 03:36:58.372
TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS TO

03:36:58.438 --> 03:37:00.107
CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING.

03:37:00.173 --> 03:37:01.775
AND THEN THE CONT CONSCIOUSLY

03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:03.377
AND COVER AND CONSISTENTLY

03:37:03.443 --> 03:37:05.746
COURSE CORRECT TO LEARN TO GROW

03:37:05.812 --> 03:37:06.380
TO GET BETTER TO MAKE THE

03:37:06.446 --> 03:37:08.382
SYSTEM WORK BETTER TO IMPROVE

03:37:08.448 --> 03:37:11.017
WHAT'S GOING ON. THE PATTERNS

03:37:11.084 --> 03:37:12.018
OF STUDENTS IS GOING SCHOOLS

03:37:12.085 --> 03:37:13.553
CHANGED. THE NUMBER OF NEW

03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:14.821
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID

03:37:14.888 --> 03:37:17.524
EVAN- BUILT IN THE STATE OF

03:37:17.591 --> 03:37:18.225
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

03:37:18.291 --> 03:37:20.127
EXTRAORDINARY. BUT ALL THAT

03:37:20.193 --> 03:37:22.295
BEING SAID WE HAVE TO BE ON OUR

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:24.698
TOES WE HAVE TO BE ON TOP OF IT

03:37:24.765 --> 03:37:26.066
SO THIS IS NOT AN AUDIT THAT'S

03:37:26.133 --> 03:37:29.336
DOING ANYTHING. THAT'S ADVERSE

03:37:29.403 --> 03:37:34.841
TO SCHOOLS IT CELEBRATES. AND I

03:37:34.908 --> 03:37:36.543
WANT TO FOCUS THAT NEAR THE

03:37:36.610 --> 03:37:39.012
FOCUS DOWNSIZED TO JUST. IN THE

03:37:39.079 --> 03:37:40.914
IN THE LETTER TO MODERNIZATION

03:37:40.981 --> 03:37:42.516
BECAUSE THAT'S THE FOCUS OF

03:37:42.582 --> 03:37:43.817
THIS WHAT WE GOTTA DO TO

03:37:43.884 --> 03:37:45.552
MODERNIZATION DOES THE

03:37:45.619 --> 03:37:46.086
COMMUNITIES ARE FACING THE

03:37:46.153 --> 03:37:48.121
CHALLENGE AND TO. ASK FOR

03:37:48.188 --> 03:37:49.623
URGENCY PROVISION SO THAT THIS

03:37:49.689 --> 03:37:51.825
THING CAN GET DONE QUICKLY AND

03:37:51.892 --> 03:37:53.760
WE CAN BE INFORMED AS WE MARCH

03:37:53.827 --> 03:37:55.662
FORWARD IN THE IMPORTANT.

03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:56.596
PROCESS OF EDUCATING OUR

03:37:56.663 --> 03:37:59.266

AND WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS WE

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:42.909
THINK WE WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT

03:43:42.976 --> 03:43:44.611
RESEARCH WHERE. IT'S TRYING TO

03:43:44.677 --> 03:43:47.147
