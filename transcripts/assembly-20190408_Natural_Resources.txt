TWENTY ONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY MAY BEGIN THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. AB ONE FORTY FOUR REQUIRES THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO RECOMMEND A COORDINATED STRATEGY FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS. ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTRY AGRICULTURE AND URBAN WASTE ORGANIC WASTE. REDUCING WILDFIRE LANDFILL HAND HOW BURNING OF ORGANIC WASTE ACROSS THE SECTORS IS CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR EXISTING CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. HOWEVER THE STATE LACKS A COORDINATED STEP STRATEGY AND FUNDING PLANS TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFICIAL REUSE OF THESE ORGANIC MATERIALS. BENEFICIAL REUSE SUCH AS COMPOST BIO ENERGY OR SOIL AMENDMENTS CAN SUPPORT NICK CARMINE CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS. APPROVED AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC CO BENEFITS. AN AGORA AN ORGANIC SCOPING PLAN WILL PROVIDE LONG TERM TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND DATE INFORM RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO SUPPORT AND INCENTIVIZE THE BENEFICIAL REUSE OF ORGANIC WASTE. IT WILL BE DEVELOPED BY THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL WITH INTER AGENCY SUPPORT. AND IT WILL CONSIDER AND BALANCE THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. INCLUDING WILDFIRE SMOKE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT A REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION. CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND THE CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO THE WITNESSES JUST FOR ALL THE WITNESSES AND AUTHORS WHO WERE PRESENT WE'RE GOING TO BE BECAUSE WE WERE VERY LONG AGENDA TODAY AND NEXT AT THE NEXT MEETING AND PROBABLY FOR THE REST OF TIME.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JUST MULLIN FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION I CAN DO TO WILL AND TO TWO MINUTES I THINK THE THE CITADEL. WE KNOW THAT COMPOST IS PROBABLY THE BEST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND REALLY A PULL TAB MOVING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. THAT WAS A ROLE MODEL THANK YOU CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD AUTHOR THEORIES OF REALLY AGGRESSIVE POLLS NUMBER ORGANIC WAY. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND FRANKLY WE'RE NOT QUITE ENOUGH AN ORGANIC WAY SECTOR THAN OFFICE POINTS OUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CONFLICTING PERMITTING INSTRUCTIONS ARE REQUIREMENTS. FOR DIFFERENT FACILITIES OCCASIONALLY -- BUT OCCASIONALLY DURING THE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY THING IS THE MORE DIFFICULT APARTMENT REQUIREMENT. THAT HAPPENS BOTH BUT THE WATER BOARDS AND WHAT THEY ARE DISTRICTS. WE DON'T WANT TO DIS INCENTIVIZE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION. AND THEN -- IT REALLY NO EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE -- TO COORDINATE THEIR AGRICULTURAL WASTE BEFORE SHE WAY SWEAT THAT STUFF COMING OUT OF URBAN FACTORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU KELLY BOY WITH A CALIFORNIA. I WAS WITH MY THANK YOU. KELLY BOY THE CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION -- US SO HIT MYSELF WITH REMARKS TO THE OTHERS SPEAKERS BUT ALSO JUST POINT OUT WE DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY ACROSS AGENCY ACROSS SECTORS. THIS IS A KEY WAY TO GET A SENSE OF THE VOLUME -- IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES AND ALLOW EVERYTHING TO MOVE FORWARD. UNDER THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCILS AGES WE WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE AT THE RIGHT TIME THANK YOU FOR ENTRY AN INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU MOVED TO THE SIDE ACTUALLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEED A GOOD FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. TO CHECK OUR INTERACTIVE CULTURAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JOHN CALDERON CALIFORNIA BY MEN ENERGY ENOUGH ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. JOSIAH YOUNG WITH THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THREE IS A BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT TO HAVE ANY WITNESSES AND OFFICERS ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I WILL RETURN TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE MEMBER I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY I LOVE MAKING IT DECISIONS BASED ON DATA AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO WE CAN ACTUALLY GET A GOOD PICTURE AND A PLAN AND I LOVE TO BE AS A CO AUTHOR. OF THE HAVE TO HAVE A QUORUM. YOU'RE NOT OF A QUORUM. SO -- WITH THAT WE WILL -- WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A QUORUM I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL WHEN IT -- WHEN WE OPEN THE ROLE FOR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOU ARE ALSO HERE FOR AB EIGHT FIFTEEN I AM? AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALL BEGINNING BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS AB EIGHT FIFTEEN WILL INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE SIR CURBSIDE SEPARATION IN THE RECYCLING PROGRAMS. WHICH WILL REDUCE CONTAMINATION RATES IN THE RECYCLING STREAM. BY COMPARISON WHEN WE THROW OUT ALL OF OUR RECYCLABLES INTO THE SAME BIN GLASS BREAKS LEFT OVER SO TO SPILLS ON COPY PAPER. AND A RECYCLED MATERIALS BECOME CONTAMINATED. CONTAMINATION REDUCES THE QUALITY OF OUR RECYCLABLES MAKING THEM DIFFICULT OR IN PART BEEN POSSIBLE. TO MARKET FOR RE USE. WE USED TO SEND OVER HALF A WROTE CONTAMINATE RECYCLABLES TO CHINA WHERE THEY WERE FREQUENTLY LANDFILLS OR BURNED. BUT CHINA ISN'T TAKING ARE CONTAMINATED RECYCLABLES ANYMORE. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE CONSUMERS AND RECYCLERS. DUAL STREAM PROGRAMS KEEP RECYCLED MATERIAL SEPARATED AND CLEANER IN THE WASTE STREAM. CLEAN STREAMS INCREASE THE MARKETABILITY OF A RECYCLABLE SO THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY TURNED INTONEW PRODUCTS. AB EIGHT FIFTEEN WORKERS LOCALS WITH EXISTING DUAL STREAM PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE OPERATING THOSE PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVIZE THOSE WHO WISH TO TO SWITCH. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND MARKETABILITY OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF THOSE MATERIALS THAT ARE STOCKPILED LANDFIELD OR BURNED AT HOME -- OVERSEAS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PENINSULA SANITARY SERVICE MILL VALLEY REFUSE SERVICE AND THE GLASS PACKING INSTITUTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JIM MY PERONI I'M WITH MILL VALLEY REFUSE SERVICE -- HOLDER IN MARIN COUNTY -- COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE WERE OPERATING A SINGLE STREAM -- RECYCLING -- OPERATION PICKING UP CURBSIDE AND WE BEGAN TO SUFFER THE AFFECTS OF THE CHINA NATIONAL SORT POLICY. SO WE WERE LOOKING AROUND FOR A DIFFERENT WAY TO COLLECT RECYCLING AND WE TESTED A DUAL STREAM PILOT PROJECT LAST YEAR WE FOUND IT WAS A A GOOD WAY TO CLEAN UP OUR MATERIAL. AND THAT WAS THE MAJOR GOAL TO REDUCE PROCESSING COSTS AND AND HELP -- MAKE OUR MATERIAL MORE MARKETABLE SO -- WE SUPPORT THIS BILL WE THINK DUAL STREAM SEEMS TO BE -- A GOOD WAY TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF CONTAMINATION IN -- RECYCLING COLLECTION AT THE CURB. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN IN A BOARD MY NAME'S LEE PELLEGRINI I'M A HOLLER IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA INSOLENT SANITARY SERVICE. MY RELATED COMPANIES SERVICE OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WE HAVE A BOTH SYSTEMS IN PLACE OF A SINGLE STREAM AND DOLE STREAM SYSTEM. THERE'S ROUGHLY TWENTY JURISDICTIONS AND AROUND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY THAT HAVE DUAL SPRING COLLECTION SOME OF THOSE OF HAVE MOLLY BACK TO THE EARLY EIGHTIES. IT IS A BETTER CLEANER -- HIGHER AND BETTER USE OF MATERIAL COLLECTED FROM CURBSIDE. WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY TRANSITION TO CITIES THAT WERE SINGLE STREAM OVER TO DUAL STREAM THE CITY A MILPITAS IN THE CITY OF WINDSOR AND SONOMA COUNTY. ARE. A RESIDUAL PERCENTAGE ON A SINGLE STREAM COLLECTION PROGRAM HAS BEEN AVERAGING 25% WHICH IS GROWN WITH TO CHINA SOARED IN THE REQUIREMENTS OF A QUALITY PRODUCT. OUR DUAL STREAM SYSTEMS ARE ACHIEVING A 10% RESIDUAL FACTOR. WE NEED TOOLS. TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES ARE OUR CUSTOMERS MEET THE MANDATES OF THE STATE AND THE GOALS THEY WANT TO DO BETTER WE ARE. LIKE THE IDEA OF THIS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO BRING SOME INCENTIVES SO WE CAN ALL DO OUR JOB TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE A CLEANER HIGHER BETTER USE PRODUCT TO BE REUSED. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE GLASS PACKAGING IS TO WHICH IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF GLASS BOTTLE MANUFACTURERS AND CALIFORNIAN IN THE NATION -- WE GPI HAS BEEN A LONG SUPPORTER OF A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF OF OF TRYING TO GET MORE DUAL STREAM PROGRAMS -- IMPLEMENTED -- GLASS CONTAINERS ADDS AS AGAIN. AS HE NOW SAYS POINTS ON THE NOW SAYS DOESN'T EXCELLENT JOB ON THE WHOLE HISTORY OF OF A SINGLE STREAM DUAL STREAM AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH -- CHINA NATIONAL SOARED SO IT'S A IT'S AN EXCELLENT DOCUMENT AND AND IN AND DOES EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM THAT THE GLASS INDUSTRY HAS THE GLASS INDUSTRY IS THE INITIATOR OF THE GLASS BOTTLE AND THEY'RE ALSO THE END USER OF THE GLASS BOTTLE IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE LOOP AND GET THAT GLASS BACK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT REDUCING THE CONTAMINATION IN THE IN THE RECYCLING STREAM AND AND A DRAWSTRING PROGRAM DOES DO THAT AS THE GENTLEMAN OF HAVE POINTED OUT ON THE ALTERNATIVE FOR SOME COMMUNITIES AND FORTUNE LIKE. THE CITY OF MEAN PEAK AT THIS EVEN TAKE IT DECIDED THAT THEIR THEIR ANSWER TO CHINA NATIONAL SORT WAS JUST A CUT GLASS OUT OF THERE CURBSIDE PROGRAM IN AND AND THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER OF GLASS IS THE MOST RECYCLABLE PRODUCT IT'S A GLASS BOTTLE CAN BE A GLASS. BOTTLE AND WE NEED TO DO THINGS TO INCENTIVIZE DUAL STREAM PROGRAMS RATHER THAN WHAT THE COMMUNITIES COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT ACTUALLY. TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE RECYCLING STREAM ON IN PROJECT THE AUTHORS HELP HELP ON THIS IN THE FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SIGNAL WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEES FOR QUESTIONS AND I'M SORRY IS THERE ONE OR ACTUALLY A TWEENER -- AN ACCOMPLICE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL AS WRITTEN BUT WE DEFINITELY SHARE THE AUTHORS -- MOTIVATION AND INTENT AND APPRECIATE THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU OKAY WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE TWENTY FOR ANY QUESTIONS MISTER CHILD JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE WITNESSES -- THEY DID THE ONE ON EACH ITEM AND SAY THAT IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY COST LESS TO DO. A DOOR STREAM SYSTEMS. THIS IS A LESS COSTLY -- MORE MORE CAR ARE EXPERIENCED AT INCREMENTAL COST -- TO COLLECT MATERIAL SEPARATELY AS A DIVIDED CART -- ANNA SPLIT TRUCK. SO THAT WHEN YOU COLLECT MATERIALS KEPT SEPARATE ALL THROUGH THE COLLECTION PROCESS YOUR MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY TECHNOLOGY CAN HANDLE SINGLE STREAM OR DUAL STREAM. SO TO INCREMENTAL COSTS A SMALL PERCENTAGE THE RETURN IS REDUCED -- RESIDUAL THAT COST YOU ENDS UP IN THE LANDFILL AND IT'S IT'S WORTH THE INVESTMENT STOP FOR THE LONG TERM IN MY OPINION. SEVEN ASSESSMENT YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO STATE -- THIS NATIONAL SORT OF SOMETHING THAT WE ALL ARE STE TRYING TO STRUGGLE WITH AND AND TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO TO THREAD THE NEEDLE SO I APPRECIATE THEM. I APPRECIATE THE CARROT APPROACH THAT YOU'VE DECIDED UPON HERE -- BUT TO IT. BUT THAT IT DOES COST MORE UNTIL WE HEAR FROM WITNESSES A WE RESPECT THEIR THAT THEY'RE ALL FROM BAY AREA. TYPE CITIES AND SO WHEN YOU MOVED FURTHER OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN DOWN THE STATE THINGS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT AS YOU WELL KNOW REPRESENTING RURAL AREAS SO. I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO TRY TO GET IS THERE AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION AS IT GOES FORWARD AND PAY ATTENTION THE COST ISSUES BUT ALSO THAT WE USE THE CARROT NOT A STICK. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY -- WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. OF DEALING WITH THE RECYCLING CRISIS IS GOING TO BE A TOP. PRIORITY FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR MANY OF OUR MEMBERS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR I'M EFFORTS IN THIS AREA ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL -- WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM? THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP WE HAVE MR HOLDEN WITH THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WELCOME YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- A. B.. THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS VERY SIMILAR BILL. TO MY BILL A. B. THREE ONE FORTY SIX FROM LAST YEAR WHICH MANY OF YOU VOTED -- TO SUPPORT. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OLD AND POTENTIALLY LEAKING OIL AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THESE SITES ARE IDLE DESERTED. HAZARDOUS. AND THOSE ARE THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. LIKE ACTIVE PRODUCTION SITES IDLE DESERTED AND HAZARDOUS OIL AND GAS WELLS CAN LEAK POLLUTION. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN APPEAR OF IDLE OIL AND GAS WELLS WERE FOUND LEAKING HAZARDOUS LEVELS OF GAS IN THE ECHO PARK NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES. LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET FROM NEARBY RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION EARLIER THIS YEAR AND OIL. OLD OIL WELL IN MARINA DEL REY EXPERIENCE RELEASE DURING REMEDIATION WORK. POTENTIAL EMISSIONS FROM IDA WELLS INCLUDE METHANE ADVANCING. METHANE IS A CLIMATE CHANGE GAS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN CARBON DIOXIDE. WHILE OTHER CO ADMITTED YOUR POLLUTANTS LIKE BENZENE CAN CAUSE CANCER. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION ON LEAKS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. CREATING A BODY OF INFORMATION THAT IS IMPORTANT. TO KNOW IN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE EMISSIONS FROM IDLE AND DESERTED WELLS. INFORMATION COLLECTED UNDER A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT CAN BE USED TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S OIL AND GAS WELLS. LESLIE AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE DAGR TO PERFORMERS VIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WELL PLUGIN OPERATIONS TO ELIMINATE ERA MISSIONS. AND CLOSING IDLE AND DESERTED WELLS CAN AND DO LEAK. AND WHEN THEY DO IT CAN RESULT IN EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT ENDANGER THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT SIX TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AT A LOW COST BY REQUIRING THE DATA ALREADY COLLECTED BE MADE PUBLIC. I HAVE WITH ME LARA NAVARRO FROM ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEGISLATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR. I GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LAUREN OF OUR I'M HERE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND -- I WOULD ECHO MANY OF THE ASSEMBLY MEN'S POINTS AT CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ABANDONED AND IDA WELLS. FOR EXAMPLE THE LA BASIN IS HOME TO OVER SEVENTY OIL FIELDS ME THAT A BANDED WELLS UNDERLIE MANY HOMES AND BUSINESSES. WHEN THESE WELLS HAVE NOT BEEN PROPERLY SEALED THEY PRESENT A SERIES EXPLOSION HEALTH RISK TO BOTH HOME -- HOMEOWNERS AND RESIDENTS AND ALSO TO WORKERS IN THE BUSINESSES. SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINING WHICH WELLS ARE LEAKING AND WHAT THE FACTORS ARE THAT ARE LIKELY TO MAKE THEM WEEK CAN HELP US AVOID HAZARDS LIKE EXPLOSIONS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. ADDITIONALLY METHANE LEAKING FROM THESE WELLS IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS AND CO POLLUTANTS LIKE BENZENE WHICH HARM AIR QUALITY IN AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH -- AND WITHOUT PROPER TESTING LIKE CONTEMPLATED IN. THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT ARE THESE LAWS CAN LEAK FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DISCOVERED THAT THEY'RE LEAKING. SO WE BELIEVE THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHICH WELLS ARE LIKE ITALY WILL HELP US TRACK DOWN AND SEAL MORE LIKELY WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA. I AB THIRTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WILL MAKE THIS POSSIBLE ME VERY MUCH THANK ASSEMBLYMAN HOLD AND TO BRING IT FOR THE FOR FRONT -- THE DATA THAT IS NECESSARY IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED BY OIL AND GAS COMPANIES -- UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS FOR WELLS THAT THEY ARE PLUGGING. THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY MAKE IT AVAILABLE MAKE THAT DATA AVAILABLE TO BOTH REGULATORS AND THE PUBLIC WHICH SURPRISINGLY IT ISN'T ALREADY -- SO WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ROCKY RESCUED COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. QUITE A MEET ON A WITHOUT UPON CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THERESA PROHIBITS ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOVING COALITION IN SUPPORT. LAUREN COMMON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. I WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WAS THERE ANYONE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THREE CENTERS WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHERE WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMITMENT. ON THIS ISSUE ALONG WITH STAFF -- YOU KNOW WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A ROBUST -- A RUBRIC FOR IN A LEAK DETECTION REPAIR PROGRAMS OUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAP PROGRAM IS ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE A LOT OF SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR SEEK. HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING AGAIN WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND AND AND STAFF. TO TO OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SHARED LANGUAGE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE A DIALOGUE TO TRY TO YOU KNOW MAYBE REMEDIATE SO THE COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE REDUCE COSTS BUT ALSO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT -- AS AND AS IT RELATES THE DATA THAT THE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO FOR THESE REASONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OPPOSEUNLESS SOMEBODY POSITION BY YOU KNOW WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS P. ANTHONY THOMAS WRITTEN IN THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION OR STEP UP -- JUST THE RESPONSE TO THE RESPOND TO THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING STATEMENT THAT THE PROPONENTS MAY. WE SHOULD WE SHOULD. KNOW THAT THERE IS A QUALITY INSPECTION REQUIREMENT BY A. R. B. TO QUANTIFY -- ANY LEAKS -- BUT THE TESTING DEVICE CALLED AN EAGLE ON THAT DOES MEASURE TO FLOW THE PPM -- THE LAB GIVES YOU FULL CONCENTRATION SO LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THERE IS WORK BEING DONE IN THIS AREA. AND FOR THE STATEMENT TO AT LEAST BE SOMEONE INTERPRETED THAT IT ISN'T IT IS -- AGAIN WE FUNCTION ON THE SOME OF THE MOST STRICT. RULES AND REGULATIONS IN THE NATION IF NOT THE WORLD'S SOLE WHILE -- LEAKS ARE CONCERNED BOB IDLE AND BAND WELLS ARE CONCERNED THERE STILL ASSETS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE FUNCTIONS AND POLICIES IN PLACE TO ADDRESS IT -- I WILL JOIN WITH MY COUNTERPART FROM WESTERN STATES TO SAY THAT WE TRYING TO DO OUR BEST TO BURKE WITH THE MEMBER -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I AS WE GO FORWARD THAT SHOULD BE NOTED IN PLACE ON THE RECORD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES SOME MEMBER.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK AND ASSISTANCE AND I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WILD FIRES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING TO OUR STATE. IN ADDITION TO BURNING OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES OF LAND RECENT WILD FIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY HAVE IMPACTS. IN THE AIR QUALITY FOR RESIDENTS WHO LIVE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM THE BURN AREAS. THE TOXIC AIR. CONTAINS ELEVATED LEVELS OF WOOD SMOKE AND CONTAMINANTS FROM BIRD STRUCTURES VEHICLES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THIS CONTAMINATED AIR CAUSES PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AS A CONTROL THE LENGTH OF THE STATE IN BECAUSE NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS TO ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CHILDREN ELDERLY AND INDIVIDUALS WITH EXISTING ROBERT REST RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS. FOR EXAMPLE DURING LAST YEAR'S CAMPFIRE THE BAY AREA AND AREAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED THE WORST AIR QUALITY. THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE DROP THE AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA TO THE WORST IN THE WORLD. AND PROMPTED MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND UNIVERSITIES TO CLOSE THEIR CAMPUSES. DURING THAT TIME THE AIR QUALITY INDEX LEVELS WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND MANY REGIONS SUCH AS THE BEAR EXPERT EXPERIENCE POOR AIR QUALITY. FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS. I THINK YOU KNOW MY DAD FIGHTS WILDFIRES IS ENOUGH FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS SO IT'S SOMETHING I'M VERY USED -- TO IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN THIS HEARING ABOUT US BUT THE SAD REALITY IS I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO PREPARE THAT THIS IS OUR NEW NORMAL. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SAYING -- WITH WILDFIRES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE THIS. BEING OUR NEW NORMAL. AB EIGHT THREE SIX WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM THAT WOULD IDENTIFY VENTILATION SPACES WHICH WERE CALLING CLEANER CENTERS. THESE ARE PUBLIC OF PUBLIC CENTERS LIKE SCHOOLS SENIOR CENTERS -- LIBRARIES PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CONGREGATE -- THAT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AND STUBBLE XIN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THAT PROVIDES FUNDING. FOR THESE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR L. AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM. AND LIVING IN THE BAY AREA IN THE EAST BAY MANY OF US DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONERS. SO IF YOU'RE AT HOME YOU HAVE NO AIR CONDITIONER A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS DON'T HAVE THAT YOU HAVE LITERALLY NO WHERE TO GO WHEN THESE -- TERRIBLE AIR QUALITY DAYS COME UP SO THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE SPONSORS THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT FOR THEIR SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. AND INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES ALLEN APES AND WILL BARNET. SORRY BARRETT. AND I RESPECT TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR FREEMEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN ABS I'M WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND FOR OPENING COMMENTS. AT THE STATE HAS EMBARKED ON A LONG TERM PLAN TO IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH BUT WE KNOW THE LARGE FOREST FIRES WILL IMPACT US FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SIXTEEN OF THE WORST TWENTY AIR QUALITY DAYS IN BAY AREA HISTORY OF OCCURRED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS TO THE WILDFIRES -- TO FILL A GAP IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO THESE EVENTS -- WE'VE PROPOSED THIS BILL TO IDENTIFY PUBLIC SPACES THAT CONNECT ACCOMMODATE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CHILDREN ELDERLY SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND RESPIRATORY EARLY CHALLENGED -- DURING WILDFIRE SMOKE EVENTS OR OTHER HIGH PARTICULAR EVENTS THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT CONSTRUCT NEW FACILITIES BUT WOULD PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING FACILITIES OPEN TO THE PUBLIC TO RECEIVE INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES TO PROVIDE INDOOR VENTILATION INFILTRATION. ELIGIBLE FACILITIES COULD INCLUDE SCHOOLS LIBRARIES COMMUNITY SAID SANDERS AND OTHER BUILDINGS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC USAGE SUBJECT TO THE GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL. WHEN WE FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL WE DID -- IT WAS A BAY AREA SPECIFIC BILL AND AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- IN NOT ALL CASES OF A BAY AREA SOLUTIONS FOR APPLE TO THE REST OF THE STATE BUT WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS. INTEREST IN EXPANSION OF THE BILL AND SO -- WITH THAT I WOULD -- ENCOURAGE YOUR I. BUT WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AS A KEY TOOL TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM GROWING IMPACTS OF WILD FIRE SMOKE THE CALIFORNIA. THE RECENT FIRES HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR THESE CLEANER SPACES ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE MOST VULNERABLE AND UNABLE TO FIND RELIEF FROM ON HEALTHIER DURING THE WILDFIRES. ANYONE EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF PARTICLE POLLUTION IS AT REST BUT AS ALLEN NOTED SEVERAL GROUPS ARE AT HIGHER RISK INCLUDING OUR CHILDREN SENIOR CITIZENS THOSE LIVING WITH HEART AND LUNG DISEASE AND LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS. ACCORDING TO EXTENSIVE RESEARCH SHORT TERM INCREASES IN PARTICLE POLLUTION HAVE BEEN LINKED TO DEATH FROM RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR CAUSES INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. AND THE INCREASED SEVERITY OF ASTHMA ATTACKS FACING CHILDREN. THE FOURTH NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT RELEASED LAST YEAR NOTED THE CALIFORNIA COULD EXPERIENCE A 74% INCREASE AND BURNED AREA -- BY THE END OF THE CENTURY AND THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COULD POTENTIALLY FACE A DOUBLING OF THE BURNT AREA. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A GROWING NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF RESPONSE TO WILDFIRES THE LUNG ASSOCIATION URGES YOU TO SUPPORT AB EIGHT THIRTY SIX AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROTECT. THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC DURING THIS GROWING THREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. LAUREN CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL RETURN TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND WHEN WE GET A QUORUM WILL BE HAVING A VOTE ON IT. THANK YOU DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE OUT JUST ASK YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY THANK THEM VERY MUCH OKAY [inaudible] NEXT. IS MR TANG HERE. MR COOLEY. UP MR COOLEY IS COMING UP RIGHT. FOUR AB TWO AND NINETY SIX GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES. IT'S A PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE. SPEAKER TODAY BECAUSE FOR IN AB. TWO NINETY SIX AND THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE CLIMB INNOVATION GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL. INVOLVED WAVE INTRODUCTION THE SUBJECT MATTER I WANT TO SAY THAT THE I'VE ACTUALLY HAD AN INTEREST IN INNOVATION ADVOCACY FOR LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS FOUNDER OF THE CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA WHICH IS OF COURSE A TYPE OF INNOVATION. AND I PUT TOGETHER MY THOUGHTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATION. IN A SPEECH I DID BACK THEN WHICH I'VE OFTEN UPDATED. BUT SO KEY IDEAS IN THE REALM OF INNOVATION. A GREAT COMMENT BY HARVEY FIRESTONE WHO ONCE SAID. THOUGHT NOT MONEY IS THE REAL BUSINESS CAPITAL. THE ABILITY TO BRING FORWARD A NEW IDEA IS OFTEN THE MOST VITAL ELEMENT IN ANY. HUMAN ENTERPRISE [inaudible] MARK TWAIN. ALSO WAS A FAVORITE ON INNOVATION HE SAYS THE MAN WITH A NEW IDEA IS A CRANK. UNTIL IT SUCCEEDS. IDEAS TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT WE EXPECT. AND A LOT OF OUR FUTURE DEPENDS UPON IT. AND THEN THE LAST COMMENT ON INNOVATION JUST AS A PRELUDE TO THIS IS THAT. ALL GREAT HUMAN ENDEAVOR HAS TO EVOLVE THROUGH THREE WORDS IMPOSSIBLE [inaudible] IMPROBABLE [inaudible] INEVITABLE. AND I FEEL I I AGREE WITH OUR GOVERNOR FORMER GOVERNOR WHO. NOTICED THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NEXT SUBSTANTIAL. ONE AND SO WE ARE IN NEED OF OUTSTANDING IDEAS TO PUSH BACK THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS KNOWN. WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS POSSIBLE? ON AB TWO DONE A SEARCH FOR THE CLIMB RIVERS GRANT PROGRAM. WILL SEEK TO ACCELERATE AND SUPPORT THE RESEARCH INVOLVING NEW INNOVATIONS. THAT IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY RESILIENT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I WANT TO SEE THE COMMITTEE HAS OFFERED TO SUGGEST A MUCH WHICH I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT. I ACTUALLY FEEL THE CHANGE PROTECT HER FROM PROMOTE TO CONTRIBUTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE ROLE OF SCIENCE IS NOT TO GIVE YOU A WHOLLY NEW IDEA. BUT ACTUALLY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION IDEA BY MAKING IT'S A CHEAPER MORE FEASIBLE. WHAT I REFER TO IS AS OF? REDUCING THE RISK. OF CHANGE. AND SO WE ACTUALLY NEED IDEAS NOT JUST THE BIG IDEAS. BUT THE ONES THAT MAKE CHANGE TOOK LESS RISKY MORE MANAGEABLE MORE FEES WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT CHANGE. KIND OF MOVES MADE THAT DIRECTION SO I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THAT [inaudible] ARM. WE KNOW FOR THE FROM LAST OCTOBER'S UNITED NATIONS INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT WE ARE SEEN CHANGES RELATED TO CLIMATE ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE THEY ARE LIFE THREATENING. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON DECEMBER EIGHTEENTH ARE LA -- ISSUE IN THEIR REPORT ON OUR CLIMATE POLICIES. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE'S SUPPORT INNOVATION. AND ADDRESS OTHER IT. A MEANS OF SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A WIDE ARRAY OF POLICIES CAN AFFECT. CLIMATE POLICIES GREENHOUSE GRASS REDUCTIONS CO BENEFITS DIRECT COSTS INDIRECT BENEFITS ECONOMIC TRANSFERS. ENERGY THERE THE ROLE OF CALIFORNIA ON ALL THESE FRONTS. IS A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ITSELF ONE OF INNOVATION. FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN CARP FIRST PRODUCED ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN MORE RECENTLY AND TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE KEEP CHANGING THE CONVERSATION. AND GLOBALLY CALIFORNIA'S LEAD IN THAT CONVERSATION AND THIS WILL BE A PART OF THAT. PROCESS. ARM. THE BILL PROPOSED THE USE OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TOWARD MATCHING GRANT FUNDS. FOR INNOVATIONS IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. IT DOES OFFER A DIFFERENT ECONOMIC TOOL THEN JUST BARELY GRANTS A PUBLIC FUNDS. BUT INVITING PERSONS WHO WISH TO OF RESEARCH [inaudible] TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS. AND I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS. IT IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA UTILIZE THIS TYPE OF TOOL. TO INVITE THE PARTNERSHIP OF OTHERS. I CAN QUOTE THE ANCIENT AND I GUESS WAS FROM THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED BC ANCIENT SANSKRIT. PROVERB [inaudible] THE ENEMY. OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND. I THINK CALIFORNIA IS ALWAYS A STATUS IT IS THE ENEMY OF GLOBAL WARMING. THAT WANTS TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN BATTLING GLOBAL WARMING. AND IF THERE ARE. INSTITUTIONS OUT THERE THAT WILL ASSIST US IN THAT. AND ASSIST OUR STATE. THEN SURELY THEY ARE OUR FRIEND ON THIS TOPIC. IN THIS BILL AND BODIES THIS IDEA. THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE CALIFORNIA ONE ABOUT A GLOBAL WARM IF THEY'RE WILLING TO PARTNER. A WE SHOULD BE OPEN TO THAT. COM [inaudible] I AM. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE PROGRAM THE EPIC CHARGE OR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. FUND G. G. R. RAF. AND I'M DELIGHTED TODAY TO HAVE MERRY SELECCIONA AJ W. REPRESENT THE LARA INSTITUTE TO TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF FUNDING FOR INNOVATION. SO MERRY. HI THERE CHAIR FRIEDMAN VICE CHAIR FULLER APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY I JOIN YOU AS A REPRESENTATIVE MY NAME IS MERRY SO LACKEY HI -- IT AND REPRESENTING THE LAR TO INSTITUTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO NINETY SIX LARA IS A LOS ANGELES BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH THE CORE MISSION OF TRANSFORMING IDEAS AND RESEARCH INTO MARKET READY PRODUCTS. SINCE LURCHES FOUNDING IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN -- COMMERCIALIZATION PARTNER TO TOP FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING AND I H. ANISSA NEST NOAH AND U. S. T. A.. AND HAS ASSISTED OVER SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA COMPANIES BRINGING THEIR RESEARCH TO MARKET. LOTUS WORK IS NASH ON A NATIONAL SCALE THE HAS PROFOUND IMPACTS ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. LIKE TO SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL BECAUSE ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE SEE IF THE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DOLLARS INVESTED INTO RESEARCH YIELDS POSITIVE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. WE RECOGNIZE THE BILL AUTHORS INTENTIONS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR CLIMATE RELATED RESEARCH WE ARE PARTICULARLY EXCITED TO BE WORKINGWITH THE AUTHORS OFFICES ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THE GAP. FROM RESEARCH TO MARKET READY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CAP CLIMATE INNOVATION GRANT PROGRAM WOULD NOT ONLY ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS BUT WILL BRING POSITIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE STATE TO FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THAT PARALLEL LOWER TO THE CORE MISSION. BASED ON WHAT LOWER TO HAS SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS GRANT PROGRAM UTILIZES THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL THAT WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN THE U. S. WHICH IS LEVERAGING MATCHING FUNDS. AND THUS COMBINING MANY FUNDING SOURCES FOR RESEARCH ESPECIALLY PLIED RESEARCH. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE COMPANIES LIKE MANGO MATERIALS CAN TURN THEIR RESEARCH AND TO MARKET READY PRODUCTS WITH THE HELP OF FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS AND ACCELERATORS. MAKE A MATERIALS IS BASED IN BERKELEY AND PRODUCES A BY A POLYMER FROM RECYCLED METHANE AND CREATES BIOPLASTICS. MAKE A MATERIALS WAS STARTED BY THREE WOMEN ENGINEERS AND WAS AWARDED RESEARCH UNDING BUT THEN UTILIZED FULLER TO THE TREES SERVICES TO HELP PROPEL THEIR PRODUCT INTO THE MARKET. LARGE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SIMILAR SERVICES YOUR TIME IS UP SO IF YOU CAN FINISH UP. ANY STATE FUNDED RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND AB TWO NINETY SIX THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. ANOTHER WHAT ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. FOR CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. NATALIE NEXT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TROUT AND SUPPORT. HAVING DORKIN SOME BEHALF A SMART IN SUPPORT. ADAM ROBIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

AND I I QUOTED BY OLD SANSKRIT PROVERB FULL QUOTE A MORE CONTEMPORARY. ONE FROM THAT RUSSIA. RELATIVELY RECENT LIVED INDIVIDUAL BEN FRANKLIN. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT OVERLOOKING ANYTHING WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE SURE WE DO NOT DO IN CALIFORNIA. FOR WANT OF A NAIL THE SHOE WAS LOST FOR ONE OF THE SHOE THE HORSE WAS LOST FOR WANT OF A HORSE THE WRITER WAS LOST. FOR ONE OF THE WRITER THE BATTLES LOSS FOR ONE OF THE BATTLE THE KINGDOM WAS LOST AND ALL FOR WANT OF A NAIL. I THINK THAT IN THIS ERA OF EXISTENTIAL THREATS. WHEN LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED AROUND THE GLOBE? AND OUR STATE IS PROVIDED THAT LEADERSHIP IN A DRAMATIC WAY. I THINK BEING OPEN TO ANYONE WHO HAS AN IDEA THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE CASE MAY HELP US DEAL WITH GREENHOUSE. THE HOUSE GAS PROBLEMS WRITTEN LARGE AS SOME RISE LA -- REPORT. INCLUDING THAT NEW WANTS OF CONTRIBUTING TO CHANGE BY MAKING A BIG ASPIRATION LOOK MORE MANAGEABLE TO DE RESPECT ASPIRATIONS. THIS IS A GREAT. PUBLIC SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA'S BUT INDEED TO THE GLOBE I THINK A. B. FITS OUR STATE CHOICES FOR QUESTION RIGHT VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. OUR IS MISTER TAYLOR HERE. NOT WE'RE MOVING TO MISTER MULLIN WITH AB. EIGHT THIRTY NINE YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS A BILL TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD. IN OUR EFFORTS TO ADAPT TO THE INCREASING RISKS BROUGHT ON BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THE COURT IN CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC COST TO CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT CLIMATE IMPACTS BY TWENTY FIFTY IS ESTIMATED AT OVER ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. THIS STAGGERING FIGURE IS ATTRIBUTABLE. TO DAMAGES TO COASTAL PROPERTIES THE POTENTIAL FOR DROUGHTS FIRES AND MAKE A FLOODS AND ALARMINGLY HUMAN MORTALITY. CALIFORNIA HAS DONE GREAT WORK TO DATE INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPING GUIDANCE IN PLANNING AS OUTLINED IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS. I INTRODUCED AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE IN RESPONSE TO THE CALL THE MY OFFICE IS HEARD FROM THE NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THAT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT MORE TEETH TO OUR EXISTING EFFORTS SIR TO ACCOMPLISH THAT THE BILL DESIGNATES THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. TO LEAD THE STATE'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY AND TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC RESILIENCY FRAMEWORK THAT BILLS ON THE SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLAN. CRITICALLY THAT FRAMEWORK WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDED ACTIONS WITH TIMETABLES AND METRICS TO MEASURE THE STATE'S PROGRESS IN BUILDING AND INVESTING IN ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROJECTS EACH STATE AGENCY IDENTIFIED IN THE FRAMEWORK. REPORT TO THE SECRETARY ON ITS PROGRESS COMPLETELY THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD CREATE THE ADAPTATION THROUGH RESILIENCY ECONOMIC VITALITY IN EQUITY ACCOUNT WHERE FUNDS FOR ADAPTATION PROJECTS CAN BE CONSOLIDATED WE WANT THE NATURAL THE DIRECTOR OF STATE PLANNING AND RESEARCH. TO DEVELOP GRANTS AND INNOVATIVE FINANCING MECHANISM SUCH AS LOANS FOR EXAMPLE TO IMPLEMENTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS OF THE FRAMEWORK FUNDING THE ACCOUNT COULD BE FROM EXISTING OR FUTURE BOND DOLLARS. ALSO WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY ALLOCATING VERY MUCH MONEY FROM THE G. G. R. F. TO ADDRESS OUR CONSIDERABLE ADAPTATION NEEDS BUT PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE WILL CONSIDER THAT DIFFERENTLY. IN THIS ACCOUNT CAN SERVICE THE APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENT TO ENSURE THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT EFFECTIVELY WHERE THAT FUNDING WILL COME FROM IS SUBJECT TO FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY PINPOINT THOSE SOURCES IN FUTURE BUDGET VOTES TO SOME RICE I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE BILL WILL ENACT A CLEAR. CLIMATE. ADAPTATION FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE STATE OVER THE COMING YEARS TO ENSURE WE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL SET OF GOALS COORDINATED GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND INNOVATIVE FUNDING MECHANISMS IN PLACE. GIVEN THE BREATH COMPLEXITY PERVASIVENESS AND DANGER OF CLIMATE CHANGE THIS ACCOUNTABILITY IS NEEDED AND I ASKED FOR THE COMMITTEES SUPPORT. THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES PLEASE. BOB GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE ON AND I'M CHIEF SCIENTIST WITH OCEAN CONSERVANCY. AND WE WORK FOR FORTY YEARS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO OCEAN HEALTH. IN THE OCEAN AS ON LAND CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOW THE BIGGEST LONG TERM THREAT TO THE PLAN ITSELF. BUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO A MAJOR THREAT TODAY RIGHT NOW TO THE STATE'S PEOPLE PROPERTY ECONOMY IS A NATURAL RESOURCES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME NATURAL EVENTS IN A RECORDED HISTORY OF COURSE DROUGHT RAVAGING WILDFIRES BACK TO BACK YEARS. WITH THE WARMEST AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND IF GREENHOUSE GASES AREN'T REDUCED AVERAGE TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE STRAIT WILL STE OF THE STATE WILL LIKELY BE NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER. IN JUST FIFTY YEARS WITH THE SNOW PACK REDUCED BY TWO THIRDS SEA LEVEL RISING BY APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FOUR INCHES. AND HIGH HEAT HEALTH EVENTS THE COULD LAST UP TO TWO WEEKS. CALIFORNIA'S CAUGHT A FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT AND THE STATE'S THEY'VE COURTING CALIFORNIA PLAN HAVE HELPED TO PREPARE THE STATE BUT MORE WORK AS WE'VE HEARD IS NEEDED. AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE IS REALLY A NEXT PHASE IN CLIMATE ADAPTATION FOR THE STATE. PROACTIVE ADAPTIVE PLANNING ESPECIALLY IN RESPONSE TO RAPIDLY DEVELOPED DEL VALLE UPPING SCIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S DAYS AHEAD OF THE CHANGES. THAT ARE UNDER WAY AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE WILL PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY. TO ENSURE THE STATE'S PRIORITY ACTIONS ARE BASED ON A CLEAR EYED ASSESSMENT OF THE THREATS OVER THE LONG TERM. IT WILL PUT TEETH BEHIND THE SAFEGUARDING PLAN TO ENSURE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THAT THEY DELIVER THE ADAPTATION BENEFITS THAT WE DESIRE AND THAT WE DEVELOPED METRICS OF SUCCESS. TO ENSURE THAT WE HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. WHILE THE STATE HAS BEEN A REAL LEADER AN ADAPTATION PLANNING AND POLICY TO DATE IT IS NEVER REALLY EMBARKED ON A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY TO CREATE GOALS REQUIRE BETTER COORDINATION. AND PUSHED INNOVATIVE FINANCING A AB EIGHT THIRTY NINE GOES A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS. CHAIR AND MEMBERS READ AT US ON BEHALF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN PARTICULAR -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOST THE ADAPTATION FORM THAT OCCURS -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BASED ON THAT WORK WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE ELEMENTS THAT FOCUS ON NATURAL RESOURCES. BUT THE ELEMENTS OF THE BILLS THAT THE FOCUS IS ON COMMUNITY RESILIENCY. WE'RE LOOKING AT AT PROVISIONS THAT ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND PEOPLE AS WELL AS NATURE AND SO WE WE REALLY LIKE THAT ABOUT THE MEASURE. TWO OTHER ITEMS WILL MENTION. BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE FROM MACHINE CONSERVANCY COVERED ALL OF THE OTHER ONES BUT THE INNOVATIVE FINANCING ELEMENT OF THE BILL. WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH A RED RATHER LARGE BILL TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE ADAPTATION. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF INNOVATIVE FINANCING AND THE FINANCE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO DO THAT AND WE THINK THIS MEASURE. HELPS THE STATE YEAH GET GO A LONG WAY IN TRYING TO DO WITH THOSE FINANCIAL. NEEDS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A POLICY IN HERE THAT WE THINK IS REALLY USEFUL MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. MAKING SURE THAT THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES ALSO TALKING TO THEIR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO MAKE SURE THAT POLICIES ARE LINE FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU.

YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS -- THIS AFTERNOON -- MANY PEN THAT I'M WORKING ON MY JACKET. OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND THIS PEN RIGHT HERE ACTUALLY REPRESENTS THE FLAG OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE -- WRAPPED WITH THE AMERICAN FLAG IT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY -- FORMER MAYOR PARADISE SCOTT LAUDER. WHO'S HERE WITH US TODAY -- INDIA AS MANY YOU KNOW THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED UP IN THESE IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- IN BUTTE COUNTY WITH THE CAMP FIRE'S BEEN VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART IT'S BEEN A BIG PART OF MY LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE -- THIS YEAR -- IN TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO HELP PEOPLE RECOVER. HIDE SO IN THAT LIGHT I'M I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB FOUR THIRTY THE THE CAMPFIRE HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AS YOU ALL KNOW -- THE CAMPFIRE WAS THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND DEVASTATED THE COMMUNITIES OF MAY GALIA KHôNG CAL YANKEE HILL. AND PARADISE. THE FIREDISPLAYS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN THE DAYS SINCE NOVEMBER EIGHTH I'VE I'VE TALKED WITH COUNTLESS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WHO HAVE DETAILED THEIR HORROR STORIES OF? HAVE LITERALLY GOING THROUGH HELL -- AND MAKE IT OUT ALIVE IN THE TERROR THAT THAT WENT WITH THAT. BUT ALSO THE HELL OF THE AFTERMATH. OF THIS DISASTER OF NOT HAVING THE SAFETY SECURITY AND COMFORT. OF A HOME AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO DO IN THIS JOB WE WE TRAVEL A LOT AND HOW GREAT IT FEELS TO BE ABLE TO COME. HOME. TO BE IN YOUR HOME TO HAVE THAT -- YEAH BASICALLY THAT REFUGE -- THAT A HOME PROVIDES. SO MANY THESE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT -- WE HAVE -- WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL LIVING IN RV'S AND TRAILERS [inaudible] EVEN TENSE. DURING THESE -- WINTER WEATHER -- CONDITIONS AND ALSO FAR TOO MANY THAT ARE STILL HOMELESS. AND THERE WERE ALREADY WAS A HOMELESS ISSUE AND IN THE AREA BUT THIS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE FIRE. IT WILL TAKE YEARS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES TO REBUILD. AND IN THE MEANTIME EVACUEES NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND. STABLE HOUSING -- WHILE MANY AND THERE'S A VERY STRONG CONTINGENT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL CHOOSE TO REBUILD IN PARADISE IN FACT I HAD A MEETING THIS MORNING. WITH MEMBERS OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE WORKING ON REBUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE A VITAL CORNERSTONE OF THAT. BUT STILL OTHERS WILL HAVE TO TRY AND FIND PERMANENT HOUSING IN SURROUNDING AREAS OTHERS WILL NEED HOUSING IN THE INTERIM AS THEY START TO MAKE THOSE PLANS. FOR REBUILDING BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THE CAMP FIRE DESTROYED FORT DESTROYED FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. 14% OF BUTTE COUNTY'S HOUSING STOCK. AND THE COUNTY FELL SEVENTEEN PLACES MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE ON THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX. THE RENTAL MARKET VACANCY RATE ALSO FELL TO NEARLY 0%. AFTER THE FIRE THERE IS LITERALLY NO HOUSING. FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO FIND HOUSING IN THIS AREA. THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF PLACE AND THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS IS WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE. TO TO WORK TO RAISE A FAMILY. AND IT MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR CAMPFIRE VICTIMS AND OTHERS TO FIND THAT HOUSING IN THIS IN THIS REGION IN THIS PLACE -- THAT THEY WANT TO LIVE EVEN THOUGH MANY WANT TO STAY IN THE AREA WHERE THEY HAVE JOBS THEY STILL HAVE JOBS THEY HAVE. FAMILIES THEY HAVE KIDS THAT NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY HAVE MANY COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS SOCIAL CLUBS AT THEIR INVOLVED WHEN THEY WANT TO STAY IN THE AREA. NOT LONG AFTER THE FIRE AND THAT WITH MANY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS -- WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITH CITY MANAGERS WITH THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT. WITH HOUSING ADVOCATES. REALTORS -- THE WHOLE THE WHOLE RANGE ALL OF THEM IDENTIFIED SEEK WAS THE NUMBER ONE IMPEDIMENT. TO BUILDING MORE HOUSING IN THE IN THE IN IN THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION. AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE KNOW THAT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS SOME HOUSING PROJECTS TO BE PERMITTED BY CITY OR COUNTY PLANNING STAFF MINISTERIAL E.. THERE BY STREAMLINING -- PROJECT APPROVAL ONLY SEEN SOME BILLS LIKE THAT BEFORE -- MOST RECENTLY SB THIRTY FIVE FROM SENATOR WIENER WHICH PASSED IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH EXPANDED THIS MINISTERIAL PROCESS THAT HELPS IT AND ENSURE CERTAIN INFILL PROJECTS IN AREAS. THAT HAVE NOT MET THEIR HOUSING GOALS CAN BE DONE I AM TRYING TO TAILOR. THIS BILL AB. FOUR THIRTY TO DO EXACTLY JUST THAT BUT FOR THE BUTTE COUNTY REGION. THAT IS IT IS NARROWLY FOCUSED IN A PUT IN IT APPLIES THIS STREAMLINED MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE REBUILDING OF HOMES IN URBAN AREAS OF THE CAP AND BUTTE COUNTY THIS IS NOT SPRAWL. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO THE URBAN AREAS OF CHICO GRIDLEY IN ORVILLE. AND INCLUDES PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENTS FROM BEING BUILT. IN FLOOD PLAINS. IN PROTECTED AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN FACT IN BUTTE COUNTY WE HAVE A LONG STANDING ORDINANCE WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE GREEN LINE. THAT KEEPS -- PROJECTS FROM BEING BUILT -- IN PRIME AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN BUTTE COUNTY. IT ALSO PREVENTS IT FROM BEING BUILT ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDS. THE DEVELOPMENT ALSO MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL ZONING AND GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATIONS. IF THE LAND IS NOT CURRENTLY ZONED FOR RESIDENTIAL AND MULTI USE RESIDENTIAL. IT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROCESS. SO IT IS A VERY LIMITED BUT IT'S A VERY SURGICAL. BILL THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BRING ONLINE HOUSING STOCK IN IN PLACES WHERE WE'VE ALREADY SAID AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE WANT -- TO IT WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED INCENTIVE TO BRING THIS ONLINE AND SO -- AGAIN THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF VERY BROAD. LOCAL SUPPORT YOU SEE. AS VERY VERY MANY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE COME ON BOARD IN SUPPORT OF THIS YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM MANY OF THEM TODAY -- SIERRA CLUB IS THE ONLY REGISTERED OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL AT THIS POINT AND I HAVE COMMITTED TO MAKING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS ARE OUTLINED IN THEIR LETTER. AND THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY AS WELL. NOT SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR THIRTY I HAVE JENNIFER MORRIS -- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTH VALLEY PROPERTY ASSOCIATION AND TOM LANDAU -- THE CITY MANAGER OF THE CITY OF OR BILL. HE'LL JUST GIVE US A MOMENT ONE OF SELFLESS A QUORUM BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. WE CAN HAVE A ROLL CALL. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FLOOR FLOOR HERE CHAU EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE GARCIA. GARCIA HERE LONG. MATHIS. MATHIS HERE MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MELINDA'S THE LAND IS HERE MURATSUCHI STONE OKAY. THE WITNESSES CAN PROCEED THANK THANK YOU. I'M TOM WINDOWS WITH MENTION ON THE INTERIM CITY ADMINISTRATORS IN YOUR BILL. HI I WAS WITH THE CITY OF CHICO FOR ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS MOST OF IT IS OUR CITY MANAGER -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO US. AS I SAT BACK I ALREADY HEARD. THE CAMPFIRE REFERENCED AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN IN WITH YOUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY OUR ECONOMY IN THE REGION IS AT RISK. YOU COUNTIES OF LOW INCOME COUNTY WITH A LITTLE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AS YOU HEARD FIFTY THOUSAND HOME MORE BURN OUT OF THEIR HOMES. WHEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE DESTROYED? UNFORTUNATELY THE RIDGE PROVIDED HOUSING FOR MANY OF THE REGION'S EMPLOYEES DUE TO ITS LOW COST. WITHOUT THESE WORKERS ARE REGION'S ECONOMY IS AT SERIOUS RISK. EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SURVEYED AND ON AVERAGE 10220% OF THEIR EMPLOYEES HOUSING EMPLOYERS ARE SAYING THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME RECRUITING. AND CONSIDERING OTHER LOCATIONS ALREADY ONE EMPLOYER. THE FEATHER RIVER HOSPITAL WITH ITS THIRTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IS CLOSE TO STORE. HOUSING IS CRITICAL AND FOR A HOST OF REASONS IS UNLIKELY TO BE BUILT IN A TIMELY FASHION ON THE RICH INCLUDING. NO SEWER VICTIM TRAUMA INSURANCE ISSUES AND COST TO BUILD. WE NEED A FIVE TO EIGHT THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS IMMEDIATELY. AND WE'RE TALKING PERMITTED EMPLOYEE HOUSING WE'RE NOT TALKING DOUBLING UP. WE'RE NOT TALKING FEMA TRAILERS WHICH WHICH INCIDENTALLY HAVE NOT YET BEEN PRODUCED. AGAIN AS WAS MENTIONED THERE VIRTUALLY NO VACANCIES OUR COMMUNITY NOW. UP THE COMMUNITY I'M WORKING IN WENT FROM. PROBABLY A 20% VACANCY TO A ZERO OVERNIGHT. INCLUDING TAKING OUR OLD STRUCTURES THE CITY HAD REPOSSESSED AND RE PURPOSING THEM AND HOUSING PEOPLE IN THOSE STRUCTURES. HOUSING PRICES HAVE SOARED DO A LOT TO A LACK OF THE SUPPLY. THIS BILL I BELIEVE IT IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE SOLUTION. IT'S GONNA TAKE AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. AS WAS MENTIONED. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE JURISDICTIONS GENERAL PLANS AND SEVERE INFLUENCE. TIMING IS CRITICAL. WE ALREADY HAVE SEEN LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF THE AREA -- FEMA'S PUT TOGETHER A MAP WHICH I BELIEVE IS AVAILABLE ONLINE. SHOWS WHERE THE REGS -- RESIDENTS HAVE RELOCATED -- TO THERE ARE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT I BELIEVE WITH THIS BILL WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD. AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH EACH OF THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES GENERAL PLAN. WE HAVE A DEVELOPING CALLED VALLEY VALLEY'S AGE WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE UP TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS. IN OUR AREA WE BUILD TWO TO FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR. HOPEFULLY WITH THESE DEVELOPMENTS COMING ON LINE WILL BE ABLE TO BUILD MAYBE THREE TIMES AT BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. A LARGER EFFORT TO GET THE REGION BACK ON TRACK. THERE'S A GATEWAY PROJECT WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED ACRES AGAIN. COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN THREE OR INFLUENCE IT HAS THE ABILITY TO HOUSE. TWELVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND UNITS AGAIN BILL OVER TIME YOU CAN FINISH UP CERTAINLY -- PLEASE PASS THIS BILL IT'S ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE RECOVERY. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER FOR INTRODUCING IT. THE RECOVERY IT WAS IN CAN YOU NEEDS TO BE A TEAM EFFORT. I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY FOR BEING PART OF THE TEAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

I AM HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER'S PROPOSED BILL OF AB FOR THIRTY TO STREAMLINED RECONSTRUCTION AND YOU HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CAMP FIRE IS LIKE NOTHING ANYONE HAS EXPERIENCE BEFORE GENERATIONS UPON GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED WE HAVE EXPERIENCED WAYS OF HOUSING CHANGES AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MORE? EVERY DAY THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO OUR RESIDENTS IS ANOTHER DAY THAT THEY LOSE HOPE. AND LEAVE THE AREA.

STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IF THERE ARE -- YEAH WE CAN HAVE THREE PEOPLE -- SET UP HERE AND IF ONE OF THE WITNESSES COULD MOVE PLEASE. AND THAT ANYONE ELSE WILL BE ABLE TO TESTIFY [inaudible] AFTERWARDS and the two minutes apiece I'm a resident I'm grace Marvin resident of Chico concerned about four thirty unnecessarily taking away the role of our local community and planning housing and parking and then removing the crucial role of the sequel -- in assessing future developments the bill states that it would it it's a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and it applies only to BiÃu six it also said that seek what does not apply to the approved projects and more over its says that -- with respect to streamline ministerial approach the the county of Butte would in other words lose control to the state mandated local program we are concerned about the role of and mission of see cça and its review of people's physical health and safety and the need to protect plants trees water ways and critters in our natural environment and any proposed development why should we drop those concerns about people and nature in the nay in the name of supposedly helping people moreover I spoke with this the mayor of of of Chico and he sent you a letter today regarding his opposition to it and in that letter he wrote I am white writing his name is mayor Randall stone I am writing to convey my personal opposition unless amended to at AB four thirty I have communicated my opposition to the bill as currently written to author meant to author assemblyman member James Gallagher and look forward to working with the member once the preemption to conditional land use authority is redacted the Chico city council did not have an opportunity ahead of this hearing to discuss and or issue and oppose unless amended letter additionally the Butte County Board of supervisors letter of support did not seek approved the approval of either of the two suit supervisors in the Chico area overwhelmingly the most populated city pre and post campfire our community is concerned about lifting conditional land use authority ma'am your your two minutes are up -- if I would like one of your colleagues to finish okay and and we also have the letter so unless you want to read into the record we've lost we all have the letter read read this part that starting here the city of Chico currently has twenty five hundred single for family units and twenty eight hundred multi family units of housing in various stages of development that are overwhelmingly not pending city regulatory authority I see AB for thirty as a considerable over reach a potential state preemption under any circumstances let alone potentially that opposition to the most impacted jurisdictions I am urging a no vote to pass this bill to appropriations unless amended should you have any questions about my personal opposition of this bill please do not hesitate to contact me next okay I have something to -- I mean the main the thing is that I mean I have total sympathy and empathy for the survivors of the campfire in the fire came within ten feet of my own house and I was evacuated but I am I see this as a really stunning over reach of power into the locally elected representatives of Butte county local governments as the mayor said -- the locally elected officials should always have the decision making power over their development and since they're already fifty three hundred approved future residences in Chico many of us see the logical next step is building the opportunity sites already listed in the general plan which already has expensive infrastructure in place this would offer the possibility of efficient public transit walkability and particular affordable housing quickly in addition the sequel approval process is there to not only protect the environment and the last remaining five percent of our endangered species but also to protect the health and safety of the people large or small developments which are not able to pass carbon emissions worsen air quality and climate change and should not be allowed the irony would be to approve a bill like AB for thirty and streamline this process on the kinds of developments which actually would contribute to such disasters events disastrous events as the campfire emerging a no vote okay can you just identify yourself there was a Beth Devereaux from Chico thank you last witness please good afternoon madam chair and members of the committee my name is Molly Colton I'm an organizer an advocate for Sierra Club California I was also born and raised and paradise my family and friends lost everything in the camp fire being from Butte county I know first hand the impact this bill could have on the region and the necessity of housing for wild fire victims including my friends and family I also understand the need for environmental protection given that our official position on the bill is opposed unless amended as we believe sequel provides the opportunity for prudent environmental consideration we have provided the author with for specific amendments that we believe would provide greater environmental protection to the bill we've met with the author and are pleased that he has committed to adopting these amendments I am confident that we can work with the author to reach a neutral position and craft a bill that would best strike a balance between providing affordable infill housing for wild fire victims that best coincides with environmental preservation we look forward to removing our opposition upon seeing upon seeing the amendments and print thank you thank you is running body else wishing to testify in opposition to the bill Melissa Romero on behalf of the California league of conservation voters and I line our comments with those of Sierra Club California thank you thank you all bring it back now to the committee for for comments or questions assemblymember Melinda's thank you madam chair I'm I'm sorry the witnesses already left the table of your rate here so of the three you don't have to come back at me and you may sit down I'm just of the three of you who how many of you lost your your home the three to testify in opposition seven nine if you lost your home in the fire thank you so here's my concern is that from what I understand Mister Gallagher there's some issue with the conditional use land permit is that correct I think what has been brought up is it somehow this would take away local control -- I I disagree with that contention if you read the terms of the bill -- first of all it requires through the planning commission process that have to go to this to the city council or the board of supervisors whatever the case may be -- it would have to be consistent with the general plan and zoning so as we all know many of us are and local government you you do a plan the do a general plan that you establish where where residential is going to be what zoned residential so you've already planned and said this is okay for a committee that's worry what the building taking place would presumably have to coincide with whatever the city's general plan AB radio right hundred there's no changing of zoning no change in accounting the the change would be that we're trying to which people could rebuild their lives is that a fair way of explaining it exactly bill bring on more housing that we've already planned for as soon as possible so that we can house fire victims okay thank you thank you some of the real amount I think you as a member Gallagher for bringing this forward and certainly as someone who is impacted whose district was impacted by the Thomas fire in the a subsequent debris flows I understand how important it is to rebuild and to get our community -- functioning and moving in as normal as a way possible in the most a normal circumstances and it is very difficult -- one of the elements that I I've been kind of you and I had a conversation about it that we've been trying to figure out is AB you know the removing of the sea quest -- piece of it and I the conversations in my district still -- happening and -- I have not felt the positive impact of public input and through the review process as much had to deal with than with rebuilding our community -- and so seen that it would be removed was a much thorough is something that you know I just throw out there -- our community has been very involved in what rebuilding looks like -- there have been really tough not just individual owner conversations but community conversations about area that can no longer be rebuilt because the topography itself change and you know watching a community go through a process to have to decide that ex number of homes won't be rebuilt and now we're going to service the debris basin -- was very difficult decision but also community had to come around and support some of these decisions a throw that out there because I know sometimes we feel that seek when the public input process can THE DISTRICT HAVE ALSO SEEN IT UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ALSO BE PART OF THE CEILING. IN TERMS OF THIS IS HOW WE REBUILD -- INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS HAVE HAD TO BE MADE AS WELL AS COLLECTIVE DECISIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY AND I JUST. AS THIS DISCUSSION CONTINUES I UNDERSTAND WE'RE NOT VOTING ON THIS TODAY BUT YOU KNOW THERE. THERE HAS BEEN GREAT VALUE TO THE PUBLIC. IN DEATH PROCESS -- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND -- WHERE YOU AND THE COMMUNITY ARE COMING FROM LIKE EIGHT IS IMPORTANT? TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY REBUILT AND IT WILL BE YEARS -- BUT BUT I WANTED TO US TO ALSO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THERE'S JUST. A FEW INSTANCES OF IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE IT REALLY HAS HELPED. THANK YOU A SUMMER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M HEARING EVERYTHING A RIGHT SO. WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL FROM SAY THE CITY OF CHICO FOR ISSUE IN A BUILDING PERMIT WE'RE DECIDING NOT. TO ISSUE A BUILDING PERMIT IS THAT CORRECT. NO I MEAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS SIMILAR TO SB -- THIRTY FIVE WHICH WAS PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. IS IT THESE ARE VERY LIMITED TYPES OF PROJECTS NUMBER ONE THEY HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING SO THAT ALREADY HAVE TO BE. A PLACE IT'S ZONED RESIDENTIAL THAT'S ALREADY BEEN AYE ZONE AND GONE THROUGH AND NOT EASILY CORE PROCESS AND EVERYTHING LOOKING AT THE ZONING CURRENT EXACTLY AND THEN IT HAD CAN'T. INVOLVE -- YOU KNOW ON A FLOOD PLAIN AGRICULTURALLY PROTECTED AREA OR OTHER BUYER MENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA -- SO IT'S IT'S THERE'S GONNA BE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF PROJECTS HERE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TOOL AND WHAT IT WOULD DO FOR THE SO IN THOSE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE A MINISTERIAL PROCESS. THE SO AS LONG AS YOU MET THAT CRITERIA YOU GET APPROVED BUT YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE THE PLANNING COMMISSION YOU'D STILL HAVE TO GO TO THE THE BOARD. IT WOULD BE PUBLIC INPUT THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS. AND AS LONG AS IT MET THE CRITERIA AND MEETS THE OBJECT YOU COULD ALSO HAVE DESIGN CRITERIA. IN PLACES MANY COMMUNITIES DO. AND AS LONG AS A MET THAT CRITERIA IT WOULD IT WOULD BE MINISTERIAL E. APPROVED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. NOW SOME MIGHT TAKE THAT IS TAKING AWAY THEIR THEIR CONTROLLER DISCRETION BECAUSE OF THAT FACT THERE. BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LOT. THAT GOES INTO THAT THIS IS A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF PROJECTS AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND SO I NEED TO TRY AND BRING ONLINE HOUSING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. AND WE'RE SAYING HEY WE'RE WE'RE COMMUNITIES OF ALREADY DECIDED. IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE GROWTH AND BUILDING LET'S GET IT DONE. IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR EXAMPLE THE THE MAYOR OF CHICO AS THESE CONCERNS THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS COULD. HOLD PUBLIC EVENT TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT ON ANY PUBLIC CONCERNS REGARDING. THE THE PLANNING OF A SAY THE HOMES THAT THE IS ALREADY ZONED FOR CORRECT. I'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT THIS LETTER TODAY MYSELF I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE EVEN READ THERE'S A LIMIT IS MAYOR I COULD DEFINITELY HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT TIME IT. THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS IRONY I IS I AM A OR IF YOU WANTED. TO I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT INTO THESE PROJECTS IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS YES. BUT SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE BUT SEQUEL WOULD BE BYPASSED YEAH SO YOU'RE NOT TYING HIS HANDS ON THE PUBLIC PROCESS OR OR AS OUR COLLEAGUE HAS SAID YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THE COMMUNITY. CAN COME TOGETHER AND HILL IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS THEY THEY COULD ALL. MEET IN AND TALK ABOUT IT PUBLICLY THERE IN CHICO JUST LIKE IS THE THE PEOPLE AND PARADISE TO BE ABLE TO GET TOGETHER AND TALK. CORRECT. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING YES OKAY SIDE. HE STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE MAYOR SO I THINK YOU'RE BILLS GREAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU A MANAGER AT THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER -- FOR FOR FOR THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ONE TALK ABOUT TODAY AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS DROVE ALL THE WAY HERE BUT FOR ALSO. SAYING TO WORK WITH THE AT COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE CHAIR TO TRY TO COME TO A CONCLUSION HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL. VERY SYMPATHETIC -- TO TO THE CONCERNS OF DEALING WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERED A GREAT TRAGEDY IN TRYING TO REBUILD UNFATHOMABLE. WITH THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF OF ALL THAT IS NOT MY DISTRICT I DON'T SO I DON'T SEE IT -- BUT ALSO TRYING TO IT HERE TO OUR CALIFORNIA POLICIES AND OUR VALUES SO I DO WANNA TO HAVE TO ASK A QUESTION FOLLOW UP WITH MISTER MATHIS ITSELF I WAS A FORMER. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL JUST LIKE YOU. AND I UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THAT ONCE THE PROPERTY IS IS -- PROPERLY ZONE. IN RESIDENTIAL AND SINGLE FAMILY. YOU GO IN AND GET YOUR APPROVAL FROM THE CITY AND IT IS A MINISTERIAL DECISION SO. RIGHT BUT YOU SAY THERE'S SOME TYPE OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT CAN YOU EXPAND. WHAT WHAT THE SITUATION CIRCUS HARD FOR ME TO KIND UNDERSTAND? I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS BUT JUST JUST IN ADVANCE OF THAT -- YES IT WOULD BE A MINISTERIAL PROCESS BUT NONE THE LESS. AGAIN THIS IS ONLY FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY ZONED RESIDENTIAL THEY CAN INVOLVE ANY AGRICULTURALLY PROTECTED LAND ECCENTRIC RIGHT. THEY WOULD STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PUB THEY GO TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION EVEN THOUGH THE MINISTERIAL THEY GO TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION PROCESS THEY GO TO THE BOARD. WHERE THERE WILL BE PUBLIC INPUT BUT ALL TURNED OVER TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR A BILL WHO KNOWS THIS ALL TOO WELL? I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SO. CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN CONSISTS WHO WAS OWNING IT STILL TAKES SUBDIVISION APPROVAL THERE STILL IS A PUBLIC HEARING THERE STILL PROCESS. PLANNING STAFF TO ADDRESS IS THE SAME ISSUES WHETHER IN DANGER SPECIES OR TRAFFIC AND I GUARANTEE ' COMMUNITIES INVOLVED ALLOWED DISCUSSION ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE. YEAH SO THOSE ITEMS ARE STILL DRESSED IN A PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS IN IN A COMMON PROCESS. SO GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF OF A PROJECT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE APPROVED AND YOUR CURRENT PROCESS ONE THAT WOULD BE TRIPPED UP WHICH SHE WOULD SHE WOULD NEED THIS BILL TO ADDRESS OUR COMMUNITY. IS A VERY DIVIDED COMMUNITY AND IN THIS CASE AND TALK ABOUT THE CITY OF CHICO. AND THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S A PORTION THE COMMUNITY THAT GREATLY OPPOSES ANY DEVELOPMENT. AND WITH SEEK WERE IT'S PRIMARILY PROCEDURAL TOOL AND THEREFORE THE PROJECTS ARE DRAGGED OUT. NOT BECAUSE HAVING GONE THROUGH A LENGTHY LENGTHY PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS BUT BECAUSE THERE'S A WAITED TO DETERMINE. THE TO SLOW THE PROJECT DOWN BASICALLY MAYBE MAYBE STOP IT. OKAY AND THEN -- CAN YOU REMIND US AGAIN WHAT WHAT THE SIERRA CLUB IS IS ASKING OF YOU. AND WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TO PUT ON THE TABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS [inaudible] SO [inaudible] I DON'T. I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THEM BUT ESSENTIALLY. ONE THEY WOULD LIKE SOME LANGUAGE THAT DEALS WITH WETLANDS -- AND ENSURING THAT THOSE ARE PROTECTED -- THEY ALSO WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE THE REQUIREMENT ON WHETHER NOT YOU CAN REQUIRE PARKING -- RIGHT NOW THE LANGUAGE READS IT AS LONG AS IT'S WITHIN A MILE OF PUBLIC TRANSIT -- THAT THERE CAN'T BE A PARKING REQUIREMENT ON IT -- THEY'VE ACID BE HALF A MILE. SO HAVE AGREED TO DO THAT -- THE LET'S SEE HERE THERE'S THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT IF THERE'S A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN. GENERAL PLAN AND AND SONY AND HOW THAT WOULD BE HAMMERED OUT. THAT COMES FROM SB THIRTY FIVE THEY'VE ASKED THAT THAT BE TAKEN OUT. I'M AGREEABLE TO TAKING THAT OUT -- AND THEN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS AS A FIVE YEAR OR SORRY A TEN YEAR. IT HAS A TEN YEAR SUNSET ON IT -- BECAUSE I WAS THINKING WILL REALLY WERE THINKING IT. ABOUT TEN YEARS TO RELEASE. AB GET BACK UP ON THE RIDGE IN REBUILDING -- ALSO MANY GENERAL PLANS ARE TEN YEARS USUALLY -- SO. THAT THAT WAS THE THINKING BEHIND THAT THEY'VE ASKED FOR IT TO BE FIVE IN THE INTEREST OF TRYING TO COMPROMISE A MOVE SOMETHING ALONG HERE I'M WILLING TO DO THAT AS WELL DOES THAT COVER EVERYTHING HERE. YES PRINT AWESOME B. OFFICE HERE THE CALIFORNIA -- FIRST OFF THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING THIS BILL -- HE BASICALLY HAD ALL THE NET IN THE NOTES ON THE HEAD AND THAT OF OUR REQUESTS -- WE'VE TALKED ALSO ABOUT HOW BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS THAT I PROVIDED AND ALSO SOME OF IMITATION THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TALKING TO A LOT OF THIS WOULD BE SUBJUGATED -- TO INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE AS WELL -- AND SO THAT'S NOT A NEED THAT IN OUR LETTER PER SE BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK TO MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO IT LIKE LIMIT THIS TO INFILL DEVELOPMENT. WHICH WE OBVIOUSLY ADVOCATE MORE -- FOR LONG TERM WHAT NOT SURE OF THANK YOU IN IN THE MAYBE THAT THANK YOU THOUGHT YOUR WELL YOUR WORKING WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND HOPEFULLY BUT TIME IS A BILL. YOU'LL HAVE WORKED WORKED IT OUT WITH THEM TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION BUT ONE THING THAT THEY DID NOTE THERE WHICH I WANT TO ASK YOU IS THAT IS AYE AYE. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CREATIVE AND MODEL THIS AFTER. SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH WAS IS THE LIE SUPPORT DEVOTED -- BUT IT'S YOU KNOW APPLES AND ORANGES I THINK THAT THE GOAL THAT MISTER WINNER PUT FORTH WAS. IN THESE URBAN LOCATIONS WERE THERE YOU KNOW MANY TIMES CLOSE OUR CLUSTER RAIL AND TRANSIT AND OBVIOUSLY PARADISE IS NOT. NECESSARILY -- THAT CITY MAYBE CHICO'S A LITTLE BIT SINCE SOME OF THE DENSE AREAS AND SO AND THEN ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW. WELL YOU FOCUS ON THIS IS SB THIRTY FIVE LIKE IT'S IT'S GOOD AS A LIGHT IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING. THIS INFILL -- YOU KNOW -- PRINCIPLE THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT THERE IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO. ONE IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT IN SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE IN. THIRTY FIVE SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH ARE NOT IN YOUR PROPOSAL. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY IT LIKE I I MEAN I I I KIND OF JOKE TO AN SB THIRTY FIVE WAS UP THAT IT WAS IT WAS. NO SECRET STREAMLINING FOR SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THAT WAS KIND OF THE ONLY AREAS IT WOULD REALLY WORK IN -- SO I'VE I'VE MODELED. FOUR THIRTY OFF OF THIRTY FIVE THAT I WOULD CALL IT. SICK WITH STREAMLINING FOR BUTTE COUNTY HERE AND SO I'VE I'VE DEFINITELY IN TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT THERE YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS DIFFERENT AS I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW -- AND MANY AB THE VISITED. YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. VERY URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WE DO HAVE URBAN AREAS -- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. BUT THIS WOULD ENABLE INFILL PROJECTS IT WOULD ENABLE A MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS APARTMENTS THERE'S A LACKS THE A LOT OF APARTMENT HOUSING IN CHICO PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE MORE -- IN IN OTHER IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL. BUT ALSO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF PART OF HOW PEOPLE LIVE UP IN THIS IN THIS AREA THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ON THE RICH ARE USED -- TO BUT WE NEED IT ALL RIGHT WE NEED WE DON'T JUST NEED ONE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT'S WHY THIS ALLOWS. FOR THE WHOLE GAMUT -- AND BUT ONLY IN THOSE LIMITED AREAS WHERE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA BASICALLY. YES MA'AM I HAVE TO INTERRUPT BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO ON PRESENT A BILL I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY CODE MY VICE CHAIR TO CONTINUE TAKING YOUR QUESTIONS BEFORE I GO I I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN. AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S CLEARLY A CRISIS AND I DO -- ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR BEING WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US BEFORE WE BRING ABOUT GO BACK FOR A VOTE I THINK YOU ARE HEARING. CONCERNS AND THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE WITH THIS BILL -- FRIEND SINCE SB THIRTY FIVE WAS REALLY A BILL THAT WAS MEANT -- TO FORCE ARE RETICENT -- CITY COUNCILS IN URBAN AREAS I'VE TO FORCE THEM TO ALLOW PROJECTS WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SO IT'S STILL UNCLEAR TO ME WITH THIS BILL. IF A PROJECT COMES IN IT MEETS THE CRITERIA OF BEINGS UP KIND OF THE RIGHT KIND OF PROJECT FOR THE ZONING AND OTHERS WHETHER CITY COUNCIL COULD STILL DENY IT THAT STILL UNCLEAR TO ME. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S YOUR INDICATION TO ALLOW THAT LEVEL OF REVIEW BUT THAT'S NOT ALL WITH SB -- THIRTY FIVE DID AND I I THINK BECAUSE YOUR BILL MAHER MIRRORS THAT BILL SO CLOSELY THAT WE REALLY DO NEED. TO YOU KNOW YOU'RE IT IS THAT ROUND PEG SQUARE HOLE OR WHATEVER THE EXPRESSION IS BASICALLY TO GIVE COME BACK WITH THE CLOTHES. ON RIGHT [inaudible] SENS [inaudible] YEAH -- BUT YOU KNOW TO BETTER DEFINE WHAT IT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF URBAN MEANS TO NARROW THIS SO THAT IT'S NOT. USED FOR FOR SPRAWL THAT THE THE COMMUNITY HAS A CHANCE TO REALLY HAVE A VOICE AND INPUT. AND I ALSO WILL SAY THAT AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER MEASURES THAT COMMUNITIES CAN BE TAKING RIGHT NOW IF THEY WANT TO HELP DEVELOPERS AND HELP DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS PROGRAMMATIC YARIS -- WITH THEIR DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC YOU KNOW WITH THEIR PLAN SO THAT THAT WORK IS DONE IN ADVANCE -- FOR THE DEVELOPERS THAT'S USE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S MONEY IN SB TWO FROM LAST YEAR TO HELP SMALLER COMMUNITIES -- HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT SO RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL THIS BILL MAHER MAY NOT GO THROUGH AN UNTIL JANUARY COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE WORKING RIGHT NOW I THINK TOWARDS THAT END. SO I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHAT WE GET WITH THIS. WITHOUT IT OVER MISTER I DO JUST WANT TO SAY IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF APPRECIATE THE INPUT AND DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE HAD AND I AND I DO BELIEVE THAT WILL BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW GET TO THAT PLACE -- BUT IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY A GREAT TO HAVE AND COMMITTEE STAFF WHO'S BEEN VERY ATTENTIVE TO THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW I THINK AS WE AS WE AS WE SAID THERE'S NO I THINK ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED OR THINGS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS -- AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET TO A PRODUCT HERE AT THE END. HOW RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER SOME WOMAN? WAS EGGMAN THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER IN. THANK YOU FOR THIS. YOUR WORK ON THIS -- I I I WOULD. AND THEN TOUR THE AREA AND AS YOU WELL KNOW I HAVE FAMILY THAT LIVE IN THE AREAS IMPACTED -- SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AYE AYE. AYE AYE DIFFER FROM MY COLLEAGUES A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I SEE SB THIRTY FIVE WAS ADDRESSING A CRISIS -- AND I AND I THINK YOUR ROUND HOLE IS A CRISIS AS WELL -- IT MAY NOT FIT IN THE EXACT SAME WAYS BUT I THINK IT IS VERY CLEAR -- THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN HOUSING. I GUESS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS I WOULD ASK FOR THE CITY MANAGER IS IT EVERYBODY HAS A GENERAL PLAN ALREADY IN PLACE AND THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING UP -- FOR LAND USE EXTENSION AT THIS POINT. IN. THE CITY OF CHICO AND SO YOUR BILL YES PARADISE APPOINT THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE LAND USE PROCESS RIGHT NOW. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK LIKE SINCE. THEY BASICALLY WIPED OUT BUT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES. RECENTLY ADOPTED A LONG TERM GENERAL PLANS IN THE COMMUNITIES. OKAY SO THAT SO THIS WOULDN'T BE CHANGING ANYTHING BUT ALTHOUGH CHICO IS IS LOOKING AT THEIR LAND USE RIGHT NOW. I'M PREPARED AYE SOMETHING PARADISE IS. NOT YOUR ENTRY POINT. OKAY ALRIGHT BUT YOU GO IN ORVILLE HAVE DENTAL PLANS IN PLACE THAT IS CORRECT OKAY -- BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY LIKE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M HEARING EVEN MORE CLEARLY TODAY IS SIMPLY BE ISM. RIGHT ABOUT THEN PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW BUT IT THE FIRE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED A BUNCH OF SORRY PICK SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS. AND I THINK IT'S UP TO US AS A AS A STATE AS A COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET SO -- I'D BUY I AM ENCOURAGED. YOU KNOW AND THE THE HOPEFULLY THE COMMITTEE WILL DO GOOD WORK AND WILL BE ABLE TO THREAD THE NEEDLE IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES. YOU TOOLS -- AND CONTINUES TO A PULLED CALIFORNIA VALUES. BUT THERE THERE IS A CRISIS IN IN THE AREA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE A NINE TO GALLAGHER ALICE'S TESTIMONY ONLY SO. IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE I MEET AS YOU KNOW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ME I WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS IN IN IN CLOSING -- AND I DO LOOK FORWARD IN TWO WEEKS TO BRING IT BACK SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND AND PASS OUT -- NUMBER ONE LOCAL CONTROL IS PRESERVED -- THEY AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAR TERMS OF THE LEGISLATION. I WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANNING THE CITY COUNCILS AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY DONE. AND SAID THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO GROW THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO HAVE RESIDENTIAL THERE WOULD STILL BE A PUBLIC. REVIEW PROCESS FOR THESE PROJECTS. SO LOCAL CONTROL IS PRESERVED IF YOU MEAN THAT AND THEN BE ISM. WILL BE LESS LIKELY YEAH THAT'S TRUE. YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY COMES IN A PROJECT WHERE EVERYBODY'S ALREADY DECIDED THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AS WAS HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO -- AND THE PROJECTS WERE GETTING BUILT YEAH OF THIS WOULD PROVIDE A MINISTRY -- PROCESS THAT HELPS ENSURE. THAT HAPPENS -- BUT IT WOULD PROVIDE FULL PUBLIC VETTING OF THOSE PROJECTS AND IT WOULD HAVE TO MEET CRITERIA VERY LIMITED CRITERIA AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THAT CRITERIA SO THAT PEOPLE FEEL FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. SECOND POINT IS LOCALS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS WHOLE PROCESS I STARTED THIS RIDE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE. WE MET WITH ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE MET WITH LOCAL ELECTED IF OFFICIALS. WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE MAYOR OF CHICO. WHO IS WHO IS WELL AWARE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROPOSING? AND HE HAS A LETTER APPARENTLY THERE'S BEEN SUBMITTED -- THAT HASN'T BEEN SHARED WITH ME AT THIS POINT -- BUT WE HAVE BEEN AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ME IN. IF ANYBODY SAYS THAT LOCALS DON'T SUPPORT THIS I HAVE A LETTER CITY OF OROVILLE. VALLEY CONTRACTORS EXCHANGE SIERRA NORTH VALLEY REALTORS. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES A CALIFORNIA BUTTE COUNTY. AND THE P. O. A THE NORTH VALLEY PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION THAT YOU HEARD FROM THE CHICO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- THE CHICO BUILDERS ASSOCIATION. THE VALLEY CONTRACTORS EXCHANGE ALL THE BUILDERS IN THAT REGION. AND PEOPLE AND VENDORS INVOLVED IN BUILDING I MEAN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND LOCAL. PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILD HOUSING AND THAT WE TREAT THIS AS THE EMERGENCY THAT IT IS. ARE BEHIND THIS AND SO THOSE THAT MAYBE -- OPPOSE THIS ARE A VERY SMALL MINORITY. AND I CAN SAY VERY EMPHATICALLY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO NO ONE WHO REPRESENTS AN OFFICIAL ENTITY. THERE'S BEEN ANY OFFICIAL VOTE INCLUDING THE CITY OF CHICO FOR THAT MATTER. THAT IS SAID THEY OPPOSE THIS BILL -- BUT IF THIS YEAR THE CITY OF CHICO RIGHT NOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER EMERGENCY TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AN ESTIMATED THAT ARE IN THE CITY OF CHICO RIGHT NOW PRECARIOUSLY HOUSE STE. EITHER LIVING WITH WITH A FAMILY MEMBER LIVING WITH FRIENDS LIVING IN TRAILERS ON THE STREET. LIVING IN TENTS. HOMELESS THE IMPACTS ARE GOING ON IN THAT CITY WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE IMPACTS BY FINDING PEOPLE STABLE HOUSING. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. BUT AT THE CITY OF CHICO REALLY DOESN'T WANT THIS HELP OF THIS BILL. FROM THIS BILL WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM OUT. IF THAT'S THE KIND OF STATEMENT THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE. THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM OUT AND OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO STEP UP AND HELP. AND WHO HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT PUBLIC DO -- BUT I JUST WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR MY COMMUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE. THEY GOT UP HERE TODAY PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING IN RV'S THAT YOU HEARD FROM. TODAY RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I DO THIS FOR AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THEM AND I'M. AND I WANT TO THANK. I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS. THE SERVER Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; ONLY BEEN&lt;/c&gt;</u> WORKING A LOT OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE ISSUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. CAME UP TO PARADISE. THE VERY ATTENTIVE TO THIS ISSUE INTO THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING THE PEOPLE UP THERE. AND MANY OTHERS THE SERVER MATHIS -- THAT HAVE COME UP AND SIT AND AND SEEN THE DEVASTATION UP THERE IN THAT WANT TO HELP -- I AM VERY APPRECIATED ALL OF THE APPRECIATED THE CHAIR WHO'S TRYING TO FIND. A SOLUTION HERE WE WANT TO THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION. FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT RIGHT NOW -- I THINK WE CAN FIND A WAY AND HOPEFULLY IN TWO WEEKS WE'LL COME BACK HERE WITH THE LANGUAGE WILL GET THE SAME WITH THE FORD SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE -- WHEN WE HAVE THIS AMENDED MEASURE BEFORE YOU? IN A COUPLE WEEKS AND HELP YOU COUNTY RECOVER FROM ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE US TO GALLAGHER. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP SOMEONE NUMBER. THIRTEEN AB SEVEN NINETY TWO SO EVER WHATEVER YOU'RE READY PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FIRSTLY JUST THANK THE CHAIR AND THE CONSULTANT FOR THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE HAPPY -- ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS THAT APPLY THESE STANDARDS TO ONLY I CALIFORNIA REDEMPTION VALUE BOTTLES AND BASES THAT ON THE MANUFACTURER'S AVERAGE -- A. B. SEVEN ID TO ESTABLISH IS A TIME LINE FOR PLASTIC BOTTLED BEVERAGE MANY FACTORS TO USE MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT IN THEIR PLASTIC BOTTLES. WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING 21100% RECYCLED CONTENT BY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AS YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLE PLASTICS. WERE SHIPPED OVERSEAS TO CHINA INTEL LAST YEAR WITH CHINA STOPPED TAKING AND PURCHASING MOST OF OUR RECYCLED CONTENT. NOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING THIS CRISIS I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK INTERNALLY TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO CAN REALLY HAVE RECYCLED CONTENT IN OUR VARIOUS PLASTIC BOTTLES. IT JUST. TO SET THE SET THE RECORD SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE. IS IF NOTHING ELSE IS DONE. TO DEAL WITH THE RECYCLED PLASTICS BY. TWENTY FIFTY THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THAT FISH. SO IF YOU COULD THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING BY TWENTY FIFTY WALK TO HAVE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THAN FISH. A NUMBER OF LEADING COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY. STARTED AND LEAD BY EXAMPLE WE HAVE THE NAKED JUICE COMPANY THEY HAVE BEEN USING BOTTLES WITH 1100% POST RECYCLED CONSUMER. CONTENT IN EUROPE COCA COLA HAS COMMITTED. TO HAS ALREADY BEEN USING 25% RECYCLED PLASTIC AND THEY'VE COMMITTED TO THE 50% BY -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE RECYCLED PLASTIC THE PROPOSAL IN EUROPE. SO AGAIN IF WE CAN SET UP MINIMUM CONTENT TO PLASTIC BOTTLES IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WE HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES THROUGH WILLING. TO JUST BE VERY QUICKLY ON THE ISSUE THANK. MY APOLOGIES ON BEHALF OF THE RECLAIMER IS IN THE RECYCLERS THE PROCESSORS AND ON I HAVE ONE WITH ME HERE FROM CARBON LIGHT BUT VERY QUICKLY I JUST PASSED OUT A A HAND OUT. IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN DOING AS FAR AS THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO TO TRYING TO HELP WITH BOTH THE BOTTLES OUT OF LANDFILL AND GREENHOUSE GASES -- BUT IF YOU LOOK THROUGH YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE BOTTLES EXPLAINING A 100%. A 100% -- NAKED CHOOSE A 100% -- WE WERE TOLD YEARS AGO THAT IT COULDN'T BE DONE NAKED USED AS A EVERY ON DOES A 100% NESTLE PURE LIFE DOES A 100% KIRKLIN WATER DOES BOTH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY I MEAN A HUNDRED AND 50% RECYCLED CONTENT. SO I THINK WE'VE COME TO THE POINT WHERE I'LL JUST SAY THAT IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT OK ANYMORE TO JUST BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING RECYCLED. BUT IT NEEDS TO ACTUALLY BE RECYCLED IN THE STATE TO HELP KEEP THIS OUT OF YOUR LANDFILL AND AND OF WATER WAYS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR TAKE UNDER CONSIDERATION APOLOGIZE SIR. REYES RICH COST ON THE DIRECTOR PROCUREMENT SUSTAINABILITY IT CORRELATE INDUSTRIES LONGER COALITION A CALIFORNIA GROUP REQUIREMENTS THAT CONSIST OF ALL REQUIRES THE STATE EXCEPT. FOR ONE WE PURCHASED THE BOTTLES PIPE TRUCKLOAD FROM STATE PROCESSORS AND RECYCLERS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OR TWO BILLION BOTTLES ANNUALLY AND PROCESS MATERIAL. THROUGH OUR PLANT RIVERSIDE BACK IN A NEW PT PELLETS WHICH IS FDA CERTIFIED FOR FOOD GRADE CONTACT UP TO A 100%. WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMING THE SERVICES. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS MINIMUM PATH GOING ON FOR FOUR YEARS NOW AND GETTING NEW GROUND EACH TIME. WE EDUCATE. THE WILLING OF THE FACTS ABOUT INDUSTRIES CAPABILITY AND NOT THE SECTIONAL HAVE TREES PUT OUT BY SOME WHO SAY IT'S NOT SAFE FOR FOR CONTACT BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GOOD MATERIAL. OR RECYCLING IS FINDING CALIFORNIA. NGUYEN RECYCLE P. TWO BOTTLES ARE DOWN CYCLE THAT TO OTHER PRODUCTS AND SET UP SHORE THE CHAIN IS BROKEN AND WE LOSE ABILITY TO CLOSE THE LOOP. AND LIMIT NEW FOSSIL FUELS LIVE IT. X. WITH THE LIMITED. THAT'S WE LIMIT THAN DO. OF SIDE THE NEW FOSSIL FUELS A VIRGIN PT BADAK COULD BE PROCESS BACK INTO A BOTTLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND TELL US BANKS DOWN CYCLE INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT OR OFF SHORT. IT'S A CHICKEN OR EGG ARGUMENT THAT COMES TO MIND WE DISCUSS TO DEBATE THIS TOPIC. IT'S TRUE WE DO HAVE THE MOST FOR BUS RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NATION WITH THE RECYCLING RATE THAT HOVERS AROUND 70% YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT WE MUST SET NEW STANDARDS TO PUSH INDUSTRY TO REALIZE MORE THE RECYCLE MATERIALS THAT THEY SELL TO THE PUBLIC. THE REALIZATION RATE FOR OUR PET BACKING ABOLISHED EVER 007%. YOU HAVE A GREAT RECYCLING STORY WE NOW NEED WE'RE GREAT RECYCLING THAT WE NEED REALIZATION AND PRACTICE TO CLOSE THE LOOP AT CIRCA CONNERY WE MUST DO BETTER. I UNDERSTAND OUR FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO OPPOSE A MANDATE MANY OF WHOM ARE OUR CUSTOMERS BY THE WAY. NO ONE WANTS GOVERNMENT TELLING THEM HOW TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS. BUT THEY HAVE THE OPTION BE A VIRGIN WE DO NOT. IT'S IF IT'S AT A COST SAVINGS TO THEM THE MATTEL YES WE USE IT BUT ONLY IF IT'S CHEAPER. UNFORTUNATELY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RECYCLING FOR STRUCTURE THE STATE HAS NO BEARING ON DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL VERGE OF PRICING AT ALL THAT PUTS OUR INDUSTRY IN A NO WIN SITUATION. TAKE ORDERS A LOSS OF HOPE VIRGIN RESIN GOES UP AT SOME POINT OR SHUT DOWN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLAN THAT'S JUST ONE COMPANY. WE NEED ONGOING GUARANTEE FOR THE BALLING THE STREET TO SECURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR FUTURE GROWTH EXPANSIONS WITHIN THE STATE AND WITHOUT IT WE COULD LOSE A GREAT SUCCESS STORY WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA RECYCLING. A CLOSE WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE MAP. THANK YOU. WITH US. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK VERY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER TINGS MEASURE WILL ENHANCE AND EXPAND THE MARKETS FOR THE NINE BILLION PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY RECOVERED. AND IT ALSO CREATE NEW INCENTIVES FOR THE THREE AND A HALF BILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT WE AREN'T RECYCLING THAT ARE GETTING LITERATURE LANDFILLS. THE EXPERIENCE THIS WHOLE CHINA NATIONAL SOARED. EPISODE HAS TOLD US THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY RECYCLING UNLESS SOMEBODY IS BUYING THAT MATERIAL IF THEY'RE NOT BUYING THE PLASTIC AND PUTTING IT INTO A NEW PRODUCT THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY RECYCLING. OUGHT THE RECYCLE CONTENT THE IDEA OF MANDATING RECYCLE CONTENT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS STATE PIONEERED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. YOUR PREDECESSORS SET MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR NEWSPRINT FOR NON FOOD PLASTIC CONTAINERS ALL AND FOR GLASS CONTAINERS. TODAY WE HAVE A 35% RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE FOR GLASS CONTAINERS BUT THE MARKET. THAT WE HELP BUILD IS ACHIEVING MORE THAN 50% RECYCLED CONTENT AND THE RECOVERY RATE FOR THE PT BOTTLE IS HIGHER THAN THE RECOVERY RATE FOR GLASS BOTTLES. AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE PROCESSOR FOR GLASS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YET WE'RE USING WE HAVE MORE THAN A HALF A DOZEN PROCESSORS OF RECYCLED PLASTIC IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE REASON THAT WE HAVE A HALF A DOZEN PROCESSORS FOR THAT MATERIAL IS BECAUSE PRIVATE INVESTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE INVESTED IN THAT. WE'VE USED TAX CREDITS WE'VE USED MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN TAX CREDITS IN ON RUDY MONEY FROM THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP THESE FACILITIES. AND WE NOW HAVE CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR PROCESSING AND TURNING INTO FOOD GRADE PACKAGING. ANOTHER PLASTIC. BUT ENOUGH PLASTIC TO RECYCLE EVERYTHING THAT'S COLLECTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THAT SYSTEM IS BEING UNDER UTILIZED BECAUSE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT BUYING THAT MATERIAL BACK. THIS MEASURE WILL REQUIRE THAT THEY BY THE MATERIAL BACK WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEE AN NINE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT AB THERE. FEDERICA MCGEE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION -- UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED COUPLE OF CONCERNS WE HAVE MOSTLY WE WANT TO SEE RECYCLE CONTENT NOT OPPOSED TO THAT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY TWO OR SIMPLY NOT REACHABLE -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR COLLECTION RATE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A SEVENTY FIVE OR 80% COLLECTION RIGHT SO IF YOU GET OUTLINED IN AB? SEVEN NINETY TWO IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING A 100% EVENING COLLECTED BACK -- LET ALONE THE CONTAMINATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EVEN IN -- AGUILAR CARRIES BILL EARLIER TODAY SO WE ARE ALREADY DOWN FROM 1100% ACTUALLY DOWN THE 75% IF THAT'S THE COLLECTION RATE AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. THE SECOND THING THERE'S YIELD LOSS OUR P. R. C. C. DID A STUDY IN THE FALL WITH OUR RECLAIMER IS AND AND AND LOOKED AT ABOUT. THIRTY THREE AT THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT POUNDS OF SORTED BAIL SO WHEN YOU GET THE BALES A COME BACK. EVEN THE RECLAIMER IS HAD A TEN AND A HALF PERCENT YIELD LOSS FROM THE BAIL THAT CAME BACK SO NOW YOU'RE ALREADY DOWN FROM WHATEVER THE 75%. OF OUR COLLECTION RADIUS FROM WHAT YOU GET BACK FROM WHAT THEY GET BACK TO THAT TO THE BAIL SO YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO A TURNING AROUND INTO ANOTHER BOTTLE -- WE TALK ABOUT THE FDA STANDARDS THAT IS IMPORTANT AND OUR OTHER OUR OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT A 100%. RECYCLED CONTENT RATE THAT'S RIGHT THERE ARE SOME BEVERAGES THAT THAT BOTTLE CAN HAVE 1100% RECYCLED CONTENT BUT THERE ARE CARBONATED DRINKS WHERE THE THAT -- CONSISTENCY OF THAT BOTTLE MUST BE DIFFERENT BASED ON THE FDA STANDARDS AND SO ALL BEVERAGES ARE NOT COULD CREATED THE COOL THE EXAMPLES WERE YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR OUR OUR DRINKS THAT KIND OF OUR WATER OR OTHER PRODUCTS AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TYPE OF PRODUCT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TIME LINES ARE CONCERNING HERE SOME OF THE CONTRACTS ARE. TWO IN THREE YEARS OUT WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THERE AND SO EVEN IF WE CAN LAND ON A NUMBER OR A TIME MIND WE ALSO THINK THAT. PRICE GOUGING CONCERN SHOULD BE CONSENT LAID OUT IN THE BILL AND THOSE PROTECTION SHOULD BE IN THERE THERE SHOULD BE -- CONSPIRE AS CONCESSIONS FOR COMPANIES LIKE COCA COLA WHO HAVE PLANT BASED PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT PUTTING AS MUCH VIRGIN INTO THE TO THE SYSTEM AND THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN ART LAID OUT. IN HERE AS WELL AND SO AND LASTLY -- THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVERAGE IT ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO BECAUSE ALL BEVERAGES ARE NOT THE SAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. DENNIS I'LL BE ON A ON A BEHALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS BUT THE ABA REPRESENT OF LAID OUT A VERY GOOD -- SET THAT THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY IN FEASIBLE THE TIME LINES ARE NOT -- COULD NOT BE MAD AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE BIG LARGE MANUFACTURERS THERE'S ALSO -- YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE STORE BRANDS THE BELL THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURES BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT FIRST STEP -- WHICH IN THIS BILL IS NEXT YEAR REQUIRE ONE YEAR FOR COMPLIANCE SO THOSE ARE AREAS THAT THAT THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK ALSO THERE'S ALSO REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION THESE BOTTLES THE PT THAT. THAT THE PROPONENTS BROUGHT FORWARD IS A 1100% RECYCLABLE BOTTLE. AND BY THE WAY THAT THE NATIONAL SORT. WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BUT FOR OUR PET. OUR PET ACTUALLY THE PRICEY RETAINED VERY STRONG VALUE THROUGHOUT THAT TIME WOULD DUMP A FEW MONTHS AND BOUNCE BACK UP TO EQUILIBRIUM. SO OUR PET IS A DIFFERENT MATERIAL BASED ON DIFFERENT. AND NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. AND SO. WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TO DRIVE TO A REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION SITUATION WE HAVE THINGS LIKE THIS THIS CAME OUT OF THE SIX OF FLOOR CAFETERIA. THIS IS NOT A WILD IS PAPER IT IS LINED WITH A WITH A LINER THAT IS NOT RECYCLABLE IT HAS A SECOND MATERIAL IN HERE WHICH IS A PLASTIC PRODUCT. AND SO THIS IS A VERY ON RECYCLABLE UP. OF A PACKAGE IT'S A WE DON'T WANT TO DRY THINGS OUT OF OUR PETS ARE PET IS A IS A ISA GOOD MATERIAL AND WE CAN GET BEHIND. RECYCLED CONTENT AS THE MOST OF THE THE THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ALREADY. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FEASIBILITY TIMING LIKE SAY ONE MORE THING SO MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH THE THE E. U.. LAID OUT THEIR STANDARDS AND THEY STUDY THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY LOOKED AT IT VERY INTENTLY AND THEIR STANDARDS ARE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THEY GIVE% A FIVE SIX YEAR A GLIDE PATH ON THAT. AND THEN THEY ARE 30% BY. TWENTY THIRTY THEY ALSO HAVE A GOAL -- REQUIREMENT OF OF 90% OF RECYCLING. AND SO THEY HAVE A MUCH BETTER RECLAIMING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND THEY'RE STILL AT THOSE NUMBERS SO THAT THAT'S CLEARLY A DEMONSTRATION THAT THAT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN SOME THE NUMBER TING MY NAME'S THEIR THOMAS ON BEHALF OF NIAGARA BOTTLING WITH THE LARGEST PRIVATE LABEL.

ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION SEE AN NINE ANY QUESTION COMMITTEE. THE SEGMENT. I THINK YOU AB. THANK YOU MISTER KING FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- AND I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY FAST TURN AROUND TIME AND ALSO ABOUT THE U. RIGHT TO THE YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS. AND SO I GUESS. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT AND THEN TO THE OPPOSITION WITH THE E. U. MODEL B. DO YOU THINK THAT'S MORE FEASIBLE. SO SO HOT HAPPY -- TO WE DON'T HAVE HAD THAT INITIAL MEETINGS WITH THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD WHAT WERE HAPPY AND OPEN -- TO BOTH DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES AS WELL DIFFERENT TIMELINE. WE LOOKED AT THE KEY YOU MODEL -- WE THINK IT'S IT'S WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOOK AT OURSELVES A SORT OF LEADING NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOWING. SO THE FACT THAT THE E. U. -- HAS SET A BENCHMARK I THINK IS GOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO JUST ACCEPT. THE 30% BY TWENTY THIRD I MEAN TO THE 25% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS WELL ROUTE. THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE HOPE IS THAT ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS. PRACTICE OF RECYCLING BIN I THINK IT COULD REALLY PICKS UP A LOT OF STEAM. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE -- JUST JUST TO GO FOR A COUPLE COUPLE DIFFERENT PIECES. IN TERMS OF NESTLE NESTE IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO I BELIEVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ALSO MR BIONDI I'LL BE ON A HAD THE HERE WILL LOOKS LIKE A SMALL MILK CARTON -- IN IN CERTAIN PLACES THAT IS COMPOSTABLE AT FAULT YOU CUT OUT THE PLASTIC PIECE OF IT SO AGAIN. THAT ACTUALLY IS COMPOSTABLE IS NOT NOT JUST NOT IT'S NOT JUST -- RECYCLABLE IS COMPOSTABLE SO -- IT ALSO WITH THE THE OGIC OF THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION IS SORT OF LIKE -- A VERY ODD TYPE OF MATH THAT WAS SORT OF BEING USED IN TERMS OF WELL BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. GET BACK EVERY SINGLE BOTTLE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY. RECEIVE GET A 100% WELL WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS IN DOUBT NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT GETTING BACK IN THE BOTTLE FOR ACTUALLY USING MORE AND MORE AND MORE PLASTIC BOTTLES OUT THERE. THAT THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE THE BIGGER ISSUE IS IS. THE USE OF PLASTIC BOTTLES IS FRANKLY NOT SUSTAINABLE NOTHING BEFORE LANDFILLS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR OUR OCEANS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR OUR STATE I THINK. IT'S REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET THOSE -- GET THAT QATAR RECYCLED AND RE USE IN IT TO TRY TO BE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ABOUT. IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY THE YIELD. PERSPECTIVES I'M SORRY. YEAH RIGHT WHEN WE MIND THAT WAS A PROJECT. WELL I I WAS JUST ASKING IF THE OPPONENTS. ARE OKAY WITH THE WHAT. IF THEY THINK THAT IS A MORE REASONABLE. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE LEFT. SO WE HAVE A GROCERY MANUFACTURERS WITH THE BRANDED FOOD COMPANIES -- WE THINK THE A LIVE IS A YEAH A GOOD WRAP UP WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRACT WOULD LOOK AT THE PHASE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL. AND I IN THAT 30% BY TWENTY BY TWENTY THIRTY IS IS ABSOLUTELY MAYBE WE COULD EVEN DO BETTER. THANK YOU MAY HAVE PERMISSION JUST TO GO INTO THAT TOO WE WILL BE A BUSINESS BY THEN. LITERALLY WE'VE ALREADY LOST. ONE I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I JUST WALKED IN I WHAT WHAT DOES YOUR INTO YOU AND THREE TO TWO OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. ON THE QUESTION OF WAITING I WAS ALSO ANYBODY YOU AND THE AND THE OPPONENTS -- TO TO TO THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN -- YOU KNOW NIAGARA LIKE AS I WAS SAYING IS THE LARGEST PRODUCED -- BUYER OF OUR PAY IN THE STATE IT WAS REFLECTED IN LAST WEEK'S CAR CYCLE REPORT -- WE YOU KNOW WE'RE CLOSE 240% WE USE THE STUFF WE LIKE IT WE ENCOURAGE IT. WE DON'T EMBRACE THE U. MODEL WITH THE GUYS WERE STUDYING. I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF ELEMENTS TO THAT PROPOSAL THAT'S WORTHY OF FURTHER REVIEW -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH RECLAIMER IS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AMOUNTS IN THE BEVERAGE COMMUNITY TO WORK ON SOMETHING THAT'S ACHIEVABLE AND REALISTIC THIS BILL. REGRETTABLY I I YOU KNOW ARTS ARE OPINION IT'S IT'S NOT THAT BUT IT CAN BE AND WE HOPE TO GET THERE SO WITH YOUR SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. WE THINK WE CAN WE CAN GET THERE SO SOUNDS LIKE EVERYBODY'S WORKING LOOKING IS EVERYONE IS EAGER TO TERRY HARD I'M KIND OF AGREEMENT -- AND I WOULD. AND I WOULD JUST SAY TO TO MR TANG. WITH THE THE THE LITTLE CARTON I'M UP I AM A SERIOUS RECYCLE SEC RECYCLER CYCLER -- PERSON WHO RECYCLES. BUT I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND OUR AVERAGE PERSON WHO RECYCLES IS NOT GOING TO TAKE A PART THAT THAT CARTON I MEAN I I DO IT SOMETIMES AND I HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETIMES I DON'T ALWAYS PULL IT ALL APART AND THEN. AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT LED TO THE NATIONAL SORT. TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT WE'RE ARE GRAPPLING WITH. MS EGGMAN I'M SORRY MISS GARCIA OKAY -- WE SAW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ HERE RECENTLY PRESENTING HER BILL DEALING WITH WITH PLASTICS AND I I TOLD HER AND HER SPONSORS THAT IF THIS IS THE APPROACH WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH PLASTIC THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE -- A BILL SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WILL SAY THOUGH I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE WHETHER OR NOT THE TARGET OF A IN IN THIS BILL. AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. BEFORE THIS COMES TO THE FLOOR TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S FEASIBLE. IN GENERAL PRACTICALITY SPEAKING ONCE WE START TO GET PAST THE THIRD NUMBER FINISHINGS BECOME EITHER TOO EXPENSIVE -- AND AND I THINK YOU CAN GET A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE E. U. MODEL AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HONESTY. ON AND SO YOU KNOW BUT I DO QUESTION WHETHER 1100% IS USABLE FOR ALL THESE PRODUCTS AND WE HAVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE AN EXAMPLE ARE READY 290%. BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT. ABOUT IT -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TIED TO OUR RECYCLE CONTINENT WHERE WAS TO PRODUCE OR SOMETHING ELSE AND HOW YOU GET TO THAT NUMBER I I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M NOT GIVING YOU A SOLUTION. THAT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE MOVING FORWARD BUT FOR TODAY I AM. READY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO KEEP THE DISCUSSION GOING AND NEVER GOING TO BE HAVING AB TEN EIGHTY AND ITS COMPANION BILL IN THE SENATE. WE NEED TO HAVE -- SOME SORT OF CONTENT BILL SPELL THANK YOU. SO HAPPY TO WE'VE WE'VE HAD SOME INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND THEY DID -- POINT OUT CERTAIN TYPES OF BOTTLES THAT PERHAPS COULD COULD EVENTUALLY GET THERE IS SOMEONE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY NEVER GET THERE SO I THINK. THE OPEN TO DIFFERENT IN THAT DISCUSSION -- THE THE THE GERMAN FROM NIAGARA HAS NOT COME INTO THE OFFICE OF WHERE THE HAPPY TO BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT HAS PROPOSAL WOULD BE. TO TO SEE HOW IT MATCHES WITH OURS BUT WHAT WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU MISTER STONE THANK YOU. THIS IS TECH. THE BIGGEST SERVICE I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE YOU THIS YEAR'S RUN THE LEAST THE LID BOTTLE AGAIN BECAUSE AS WE TRIED TO DO THAT AND HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MAJOR FILERS THEY SAID DON'T DO THIS TO US DON'T DO THIS TO US. WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW GREAT WE ARE DOING -- AND RECYCLE CONTENT IN OUR BOTTLES AND SO THEY LAID OUT THESE GREAT NUMBERS AND I THINK YOUR YOUR PATH IS REALLY WHAT THEY WERE TRYING. TO USE TO CONVINCE US TO NOT DO THE LEAST THE LEAD SO IT'S IT'S INTERESTING THIS YEAR NOW ALL SAID THIS IS THE BIG BUGABOO AND WE CAN'T GET THERE. THAT'S THE REFRAIN WE CONSTANTLY HEAR OH CAN'T DO THIS INVISIBLE INVISIBLE VISIBLE AND THEN TURNS OUT THINGS ARE VISIBLE. SO I I WISH YOU LUCK DO YOU HAVE A MOTION ON THIS YET. HAVE YOU SOCIAL QUORUM. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM THAT ARTICLE MOTION ON THIS BILL. OKAY WITH EMOTION THE SECOND ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AND I DO A REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FOR THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISIS IS WE HAVE IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU. I DO YOU HAVE ANY YOU WANT TO CLOSE TO DO JUST VERY QUICKLY CLOSING WITH THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GONE MADAM CHAIR BUT REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THE CONSULTANTS WORKING WORKING WITH AS I HEAR AT THE FEEDBACK FROM MY COLLEAGUES I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT WE KNOW. THIS ISSUE IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE WE WERE WERE UP TO I KNOW THAT THE STATE DOES BODIES UP TO THE CHALLENGE. AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET -- A MINIMUM CONTENT BUILT ON THE SHORES THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT WE HAVE A ROLL CALL A SECOND WE HAVE A VOTE A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE. ITEM TEN A. B. SEVEN NINETY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TEAM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA. CHAU [inaudible] EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LIMóN. MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY [inaudible] MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NOT VOTING. RIGHT TO TREAT STONE SO [inaudible] NINE FOR ONE THE VOTERS FORTY ONE BELIEVE THE REAL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MISTER KALRA [inaudible] YOUR NEXT. WITH ELEVEN SIXTY TWO YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN SIXTY TWO WILL TAKE ME FOR ACTION TO CURB SINGLE HOUSE ON THE BILL'S DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE AND COUNTY AMOUNTS. PROVISIONAL PLASTIC WASTE AS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING AND AND THIS COMMITTEE IS AS COST REALLY OVER MANY YEARS -- IS HAVING DEVASTATING IMPACT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND AS IN DALLAS IS RIGHTLY POINTS OUT ITS POLICING OUR OCEANS. SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ALSO ADDING TO OUR LANDFILLS. THOSE TINY PLASTIC SHAMPOO SHAMPOO BOTTLES OTHER PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS REPRESENT A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WASTE I CAN EASILY BE ELIMINATED. TWO MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES. THINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU STAY IN A HOTEL EVERY DAY WORKERS MUST RESTOCK POSSIBLE THE NEW ONES OFTENTIMES REGARDLESS OF FULL USED BY THE GAS OR JUST USING A SMALL FRACTION OF IT. WITH OVER NINETY FIVE HUNDRED TRAVEL ACCOMMODATION EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOTEL ROOMS A PLASTIC WASTE STREAM QUICKLY ADDS UP. BACK ORDER THE AMERICAN HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION AS PACOLLI A APPROXIMATELY HALF A MILLION HOTEL ROOMS IN CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ARE JUST THOSE THEIR ACCOUNT ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ASSOCIATION. SO LIKELY MANY MORE. BOB IF YOU OF COUNT FOR A THOUSAND BOTTLES PER ROOM PER YEAR SUGGEST BY THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. THAT AMOUNTS TO APPROXIMATELY HALF A BILLION PLASTIC BOTTLES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE EVERY YEAR AND AGAIN THAT'S A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE. BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF ROOMS -- THAT WE HAVE. AB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO PROHIBITS A LODGING ESTABLISHMENT PROVIDING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES CONTAINING A PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. TO A GAS AND THE SLEEPING ACCOMMODATION. FORTUNATELY MANY BUSINESSES AND BRANDS IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY ARE ALREADY FACING OUT THE SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES AND PAPER PAPER -- FOR REFILLABLE DISPENSERS OR IN THE CASE OF SOAPS USING A PAPER. OF A BY NOT OFFERING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS HOTELS MOTELS AND OTHER LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS. WE SB CAN REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC CONSUMPTION AND INCREASED CONSUMER AWARENESS OF OUR USE OF PLASTIC IN FACT A LOT OF WHAT THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IS DOING IS BEING DRIVEN BY CONSUMER CHOICE AND PREFERENCE AS WELL. I'VE BEEN A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS ASSOCIATION AMERICAN ASIAN AMERICAN HOTEL OWNERS ASSOCIATION -- AND YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY HAD MET WITH THEM BEFORE THIS BILL WAS EVEN INTRODUCED AS A SIGN OF GOOD FAITH THAT WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH THE WITH THE INDUSTRY. AND MAKING SURE THIS IS DONE AWAY DONE IN A WAY THAT'S RESPECTFUL OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS -- AND JUST RECENTLY -- THE IT INDUSTRY TOOK A SUPPORT OF A MAN A POSITION ON A. B. ELEVEN SIXTY TWO AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. MY HOPE. AND INTENTION IS TO KEEP WORKING WITH INDUSTRY AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE BILL'S TIME FRAME AND SCOPE OF ALREADY RECOGNIZE THE NEED. TO DELAY -- THE BILL BUT BEFORE A THREE YEAR TIME LINE TO GET BUSINESSES TIME. TO DEPLETE THE CURRENT STOCK IS DAHLE DISPENSERS AND ENSURE THEY HAVE DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLY. SO MANY VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO PROVIDING SMALL PLASTIC BOTTLES OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS LIKE SHAMPOO THE LOGIC IN IT INDUSTRIES IN A PRIME POSITION TO PHASE OUT THE PRACTICE. AND CONTINUE THEIR COMMITMENT AS AN INDUSTRY THAT'S VERY FOUR FOUR THINK ON THESE ISSUES -- TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP OF REDUCING PLASTIC WASTE WASTE. WOULD BE TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS KATHERINE -- DAY EXACTED DIRECTORS SAVE UP FOR SAVE OUR SHORES. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AS JUST SAID MY NAME IS KATHERINE -- DAY AND AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE SAVE OUR SHORES AND ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIAN CONSTITUENTS -- WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT AB ELEVEN SIXTY TWO SAVE OUR SHORES AS A NONPROFIT BASED IN SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA WHOSE MISSION IS TO STEWART CLEAN SHORES HEALTHY HABITATS AND LIVING WATERS. WHICH FOSTER THRIVING MARINE SYSTEMS ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST. PLASTIC POLLUTION AS EVIDENCED BY THE EXPLOSION OF MAINSTREAM NEWS COVERAGE HAS REACHED A CRISIS STAGE. SERIOUS ACTION IS REQUIRED TO STEM THE TALKS A VACATION NUMBER OCEAN THE DEATH OF SEA LIFE AND SEE BIRDS IN THE VERY HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF HUMANS. TRACES THE PLASTICS ARE NOW FOUND IN FOODS AND BEVERAGES WE CONSUME INCLUDING FISH SEA SALT HONEY TAP WATER AND WATER. PLASTICS AND THEIR TOXIC AND CARCINOGENIC ADDITIVES HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND IN HUMAN BLOOD IN STOOL. MANY HOTEL CHAINS INCLUDING MARY ON HILTON HAVE ALREADY BEGUN SWITCHING TO WALL MOUNTED DISPENSER STIRRED REDUCE WASTE. PER STUDY RELEASED BY MARRIOTT AN AVERAGE SIZE HOTEL WHICH THEY DEFINE AS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ROOM PROPERTY. CAN ELIMINATE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BOTTLES PER YEAR YIELDING TWO THOUSAND IN ANNUAL SAVINGS WHILE ALSO YOU ALSO. KEEPING ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POUNDS OF PLASTIC CONSUMING EACH BOTTLE WEIGHS ONLY ONE POINT FIVE OUNCES OUT OF THE LANDFILL EVERY YEAR. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL A WIN WIN SCENARIO. LIMITING SINGLE USE PLASTIC TOILETRY BOTTLES ALSO RESULTS IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. GHGS ARE RELEASED DURING EVERY PHASE OF EVERY YEAH EACH PLASTIC BOTTLES LIFECYCLE FROM FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION THROUGH PLASTIC RESIN PRODUCTION TO PACKAGING MANUFACTURING LANDFILL DISPOSAL. USING THESE ARGUMENTS WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN URGING THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO TAKE ACTION. IN NOVEMBER TWO IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IF YOU CAN FINISH UP PLEASE YOUR TIME IS YET. SANTA CRUZ BECAME THE FIRST COUNTY AND MAYBE A IN THE CALIFORNIA AND POSSIBLY IN THE U. S. TO PASS SUCH IN A MEASURE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING IN HAVE ACTIVE -- AN INDICATION OF ACTION FROM SIT CITY OF SANTA CRUZ SCOTTS VALLEY CAPITAL LACKS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIRMAN. JOHN CALDWELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR REACHING OUT TO US -- WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS HE SAID WE WE I HAVE ASKED -- FIRST AMENDMENTS AND WE WOULD SUPPORT IT IF THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN OUR INDUSTRIES A LEADER IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT AND SUSTAINABILITY AND DEMONSTRATED TANGIBLE COMMITMENT. TO ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. INTER CONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUP HAS RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SCORE FOR THE INDUSTRY ON THE CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT HEALTH IN AS REDUCE LANDFILL WASTE BY 41%. HI IT IS COMMITTED TO DIVERTING BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY MARRIOTT HAS -- RECYCLED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS. OF PLASTIC JUST IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE. OUR INDUSTRY IS ALREADY TAKING RECOGNIZED INNOVATIVE STEPS TO CREATE A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING. IS THAT THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HELP SB ELEVEN SIXTY TO MELD WITH THESE EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND SO WE WERE WE TALK TO THE THE AUTHOR ABOUT THIS -- WE WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SO SURE THAT CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BE LIMITED THE SHOWER BATH ACCESSORIES. WHICH THE INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY BEGUN IN EARNEST OVER THE PAST DECADE WITH SEVERAL HOTEL BRANDS ALREADY MOVING AWAY FROM SINGLE USE SHAMPOO CONDITIONER LIKE WHICH SHALL. WE BELIEVE THIS FOCUSED APPROACH -- MEETS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND WILL PREVENT LATER DISPUTES. SECONDLY WE REQUEST A RIGHT TO CURE PROVISIONS SIMILAR TO WHAT IS REQUIRED OF ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING SIGNAGE THAT HOTELS AND OTHER BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT. TO LASTLY REQUEST AN IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR ALL LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS WITH FIFTY ROOMS ARE MORE. THAN A YEAR LATER FOR THOSE. WITH FIFTY ROOMS ARE LAST. ON THAT THIS OUR PRIDE THIS WILL PROVIDE HOTELS WITH ENOUGH TIME TO EXHAUST OUR CURRENT SUPPLY OF SHAMPOO CONDITIONER LIQUID SOAP SO AS NOT TO ENCOURAGE UNNECESSARY WASTE. ADDITIONALLY THE REALITY IS A MANDATE LIKE THIS ON A STATE WITH MORE THAN HALF A MILLION HOTEL LODGING ROOMS MAY CAUSE BACKLOGS AND SHORTAGES. ON THE REPLACEMENT TECHNOLOGY AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR REACHING OUT TO US IN HIS WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THIS WAS LOWER. YOU ARE THERE ARE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. BOTTOM ANYONE FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT. THERESA RIGOROUS ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SORRY LITTLE OUT THERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KAREN ROSS AND WITH THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL WHERE THE INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION. REPRESENTING THE FRAGRANCE PERSONAL CARE -- AND BECAUSE MEDICS ASSOCIATION WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN STATE AND WE ARE HERE TO OPPOSE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS BUT LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEM -- WE THINK THIS BILL IS WELL INTENDED WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL AS FAR AS REDUCING PLASTIC PACKAGING. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE SET AGGRESSIVE COMMITMENTS ON THAT FRONT -- WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES -- WITH THE SCOPE OF THE BILL -- WITH THE SIZE OF THE TWELVE OUNCES OR LESS WE THINK THAT COULD ON IN A FOR ONLY BàN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRODUCT. AND WE ALSO HAVE -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF MY MEDIUM AND SMALL COMPANIES THAT ARE IN STATE THAT COULD BE READ READ -- PACKAGING THE PRODUCT OF DISTRIBUTING THE PRODUCT UNDER BRAND NAMES TO HOTELS AND WE DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BRING THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES. CAN COMPLY WITH US BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- BUT REGRETFULLY OPPOSE AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSE. GOOD AFTERNOON ADAM REQUIEM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE HAVE A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- TO GO TO NEUTRAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NUMBER GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- SO MISTER KALRA -- MANY OF THESE BOTTLES ARE RECYCLABLE. YES THEY ARE [inaudible] SURE THERE. MISTER KALRA MANY OF THESE BOTTLES ARE RECYCLABLE IF THEY'VE IF THEY'VE GOT THE SYMBOL UNDER NEED THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS LIKE WHAT THEY CAN BE REACHED THAT CAN BE PUT IN THE RECYCLE. BIN IN THE ROOM ON THAT DOT THE HOTELS CAN THEN YOU KNOW SEND THEM OUT FOR READ FOR RECYCLING SO I'M JUST CURIOUS. RATHER THAN A BAN WHY NOT MORE OF A FOCUS ON AN EDUCATION. CAMPAIGN. WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT POINT. ONE IS THAT WE KNOW ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER A PIECE OF PLASTIC GETS THE LESS LIKELY THAT IT DOES ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED AND BACKED. UP AND AND A SUMMER STYLE HE'S OVER THERE THAT. THIS BILL IDEA CAME BECAUSE IT WAS A SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING THAT A SIMILAR STONE WAS -- HOLDER THE HELD IN SANTA CRUZ NEVER DIFFERENT -- IDEAS AS TO WHAT KINDS OF THINGS COULD REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC USAGE THAT ENDS UP IN THE WASTE STREAM AND IN THE OCEANS. AND THIS WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE MOST MORSE BUT MOST POSSIBLY BECAUSE NOT JUST THE SIZE BUT THE VOLUME OF THE AMOUNT OF THEM. IS SO LARGE THE DAD A NOTE IN AN INORDINATE INORDINATE A NUMBER OF THEM ARE ENDING UP IN THE WAY STE NOT IN THE WAIST PROPER WASTE AND RECYCLING STREAM. BUT ENDING UP IN OUR RIVER WAYS AND OUR WATERWAYS AND INTO THE OCEAN. SECONDLY OF THE WE HAVE THIS LARGER CONVERSATION -- SUMMER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS HAVE BILLS REGARDING SINGLE USE PLASTICS IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TACKLE THE ISSUES IN THESE PLASTICS WE HAVE TO FIND. AREAS WHERE WE CAN REDUCE THEIR USE AND I BELIEVE THAT HOTELS UP ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THE INDUSTRY ON ITS OWN WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATION. IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IS ABSOLUTELY LOW HANGING FRUIT TO REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN OUR IN -- IN OUR STATE -- AGAIN YOU KNOW MERRY OUT BY ITSELF BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND IN NORTH AMERICA WILL HAVE WELL OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES -- BUT ENDED THIS YEAR -- WELL BEFORE ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE WOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE OF OF OF OF REMOVING SO THEY USE PLASTICS AND THEIR TOILETRIES. AND SO IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY A MATTER OF WHETHER SOMETHING CAN BE RECYCLED OR NOT. IT'S A MATTER OF HOW DO WE ULTIMATELY BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A PRODUCTION COSTS AS WELL TO CREATING PLASTIC THAT AB HAD TO CONTRIBUTE TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CRUDE JOBS TO WASTE. AND SO IF WE CAN REDUCE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF PLASTIC IS PARTICULARLY SINGLE USE. I THINK THAT IT IT HITS A LOT OF DIFFERENT GOALS WE HAVE OKAY BUT YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT KIND OF STAND ABOUT WHICH IS THAT THE INDUSTRY IS REALLY ALREADY TAKING THIS UPON THEMSELVES. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS SO WHY THEN DO WE NEED GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION. IF IT'S WORKING. WELL IT'S A COUPLE REASONS ONE IS GAS INDUSTRY IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE BRANDS. I THINK THAT WITH LEGISLATION NOT ONLY CAN WE PAYS IT OUT ALL TOGETHER WHICH I THINK IS A A NOBLE COLIN OF OF APPROPRIATE GOAL IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY. BUT BY HAVING LEGISLATION WE CAN ALSO. HELP IN WORKING WITH THE LODGING ASSOCIATE HOW AND ACTIVELY WITH THOSE INDEPENDENT HOTELS THAT AREN'T PART OF THE MARRIOTT BRAND WHAT HAVE YOU MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MANY OF THEM WANT TO I'VE MET WITH I MET WITH SO MANY OF THEM. THEY WANT TO THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM TO DO IT WITH THE BILL NOT ONLY CAN WE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MANDATING IT'S ALSO ABOUT. CREATING A TIE MINOR SUPPORT SYSTEM TO HELP ALL OF THE HOTEL YEARS A MOTEL YEARS -- PAYS US IN THESE PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT GOAL IN ITSELF IS A GOOD GOAL SO WHAT IN THE WHICH PART IN THE BILL OFFER SUPPORT TO THEIR SMALLER HOTEL. WELL FOR ONE OF THE AREAS THAT. WERE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE. OF THAT WE DISCUSSED AND I I KNOW WELL A REPRESENTATIVE HERE FROM THE HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION A REFERENCE -- TO AND IT'S SOMETHING I'VE DISCUSSED. EVEN WITH OF THE ORGANIZATION IS THAT ADDITIONAL TIME LINE OF ONE YEAR FOR SMALLER HOTELS. I THINK THAT ADDITIONAL YEAR ALLOWS THE ASSOCIATION -- AND ALLOWS. US AS A STATE TO EDUCATE AND GET THE WORD OUT THERE ABOUT IT AND TO HELP OFFER ASSISTANCE AND CONNECT WITH SAYS ABSOLUTELY -- SOMETHING THAT -- I'M I'M ABSOLUTELY INTERESTED IN DOING IS ENSURING THAT -- AND THAT'S PART OF THESE I MET WITH THE BILL DISSOCIATION WAS A HOA -- BEFORE I EVEN REDUCE THE BILL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A HEAVY HANDED ABLE COMING AT YOU -- COMING AT YOUR INDUSTRY IT WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT WAS A LET'S MEET NOW BEFORE I EVEN KNEW DISABILITY AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING OFFERED THE CONVERSATIONS GOING TO CONTINUE. TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE BUT ABSOLUTELY THERE'S AN INTEREST TO HELP WITH THE INDEPENDENT SMALLER HOTELS HELP FACILITATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH COMMENTS. SOME MEMBER MATHIS JUST. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER BILLS FLOATING AROUND THE LEGISLATURE THAT MORE TOWARDS -- YOU KNOW KINDA INFORMING THE PUBLIC ON RECYCLING -- HAVING DIFFERENT GROUPS ACTUALLY SET UP RECYCLING BINS I MEAN I'VE NEVER WALKED INTO A HOTEL ROOM. IT'S IN A BLUE. RECYCLING BAND -- MALIK I'VE SEEN A FEW BUT IT'S YOU KNOW YOU YOU GOT A LITTLE TRASH CANS THERE ARE THEY OFFERING RECYCLING BINS I MEAN WHAT WOULD IT BE A MUCH EASIER PUSH -- FOR HOTELS JUST. TO HAVE THEM OFFER RECYCLING BINS THAT WE WE KNOW WE'RE GETTING THIS. AND IT GOES INTO TO THE PLASTIC -- RECYCLING IN A GOES AND MISTER TEAMS BILL I'M A GOES IN AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- NO IT WE A LOT OF US GREW UP WITH THIS -- YOU KNOW RECYCLE REDUCE REUSE. BIND SCHOOLS AND NOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE JUST WANT TO GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT COULD BE A RECYCLED PRODUCT ON JUST BECAUSE IT'S BAD -- OR OR SOMEBODY DEEMS THAT BAD -- YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE THE WHOLE PURPOSE -- THE EARLIEST -- FOR FOR THE MILLENNIALS ON MY GENERATION THAT WE GOT -- INSTITUTIONALIZED IN IN -- SCHOOL WAS TO RECYCLE ON NOT TO GET RID OF SO WHY AREN'T WE FOCUSING ON RECYCLING THESE PRODUCTS AND SAY HAVE THE HOTELS -- HAVE RECYCLE BINS THERE IN THE ROOMS TO CAPTURE THAT OR THE YOU KNOW ON SPENT SHAMPOOS CAN GO TO HOMELESS SHELTERS WERE HAVING AN ISSUE GETTING PRODUCTS THERE I MEAN THERE'S A HUNDRED ONE THINGS WE CAN DO. BUT I I FEEL LIKE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY OKAY THIS IS BAD. LET'S GET RID OF IT YOU KNOW IN THE I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT FLOW AROUND UP HERE I I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE LOOK YOU KNOW I GREW UP JUST LIKE YOU DID LEARNING ABOUT RECYCLING WE TAUGHT OUR PARENTS HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GROW UP. WITH THAT AND THE PART OF THE REASON IS THAT POSSIBLE LIBERATED DURING OUR UPBRINGING IN A WAY THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE NOW WE KNOW WHAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE. THIS IS AN EVOLUTION IT'S AN EVOLUTION RECOGNIZING IS NOT JUST ABOUT ABOUT RECYCLING PLASTICS BUT WE HAVE TO START ARE WE AT THE START TO PHASE AS MUCH THE MOTHER THAT'S PACKED THAT'S PRACTICAL. THAT MAKES SENSE -- SECONDLY AND THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN THIS HOUSE A CITY COUNCIL IN A MANY OF YOUR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WHEN I VISIT RECYCLING PLANTS IF THERE ARE CONTAMINANTS -- THAT THEIR OF THEIR CONTAMINANTS WHICH A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS WOULD HAVE AS FAR AS RECYCLING IS CONSIDERED. THE END OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT RECYCLE THEY ACTUALLY JUST PUT INTO LANDFILL AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE NOT AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ABOUT IS EDUCATION ENOUGH. PLASTIC. BAGS AT THE GROCERY STORES I KNOW I'M SURE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ON ON WHETHER THAT WAS A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT PRO. TWO TO THREE DECADES THERE WAS A EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR PLASTIC BAGS BACK THE GROCERY STORE THEY WOULD TAKE IT BACK. THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE JUST DIDN'T DO IT AND SO THE THOUGH OF THE REAL THE REAL. OF THE THE REAL MOVE THAT HAD TO BE MADE WAS JUST ABANDONED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GETTING IN THE RECYCLING STREAM THERE ARE GETTING IN THE WAY STREAM. NOW AGAIN I KNOW YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH THAT. THAT CONCLUSION BUT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO HAVE A RECYCLING BIN OR HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ACCEPTS BACK TO THE RECYCLING SO THAT IS. SO YEAH SO. WANT ONE MORE QUESTION MANAGERS IF. WE'RE WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON SINGLE USE SMALL PLASTICS AND WHAT ABOUT LIKE THE INK PEN THAT YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND. NO I MEAN IS THAT IS THAT NEXT ON THE CHOPPING THIS WAS CARE AT ALL SINGLE USING PENS AND WELL% OF AT THE LOOK THE REALITY IS THIS AND I I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I AM I MEAN A LITTLE FACETIOUS. I GET IT I I'VE IT BUT I MEAN WE WE KEEP GOING AFTER. YOU KNOW ONE SMALL PLASTIC AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER. ONE IS IN STOCK WELL ABOVE WHAT WE DO THIS AND GET RID OF HALF A BILLION A YEAR. THAT'S NOT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ACTUALLY COMING FROM CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER PLAYER THAT'S CALIFORNIA ALONE THAT THAT'S CAL. IT'S A VERY ROUGH LIKE NAPKIN CALCULATION BUT BASED UPON THE DATA OF THE HOW MANY ROOMS AND HOW MANY PLASTIC BOTTLES OF THE ROOMS. AND SO -- BUT IT DOES MATTER IT DOES ADD UP I MEAN WE DON'T. WE'RE IN THE WERE IN THE PROBLEM THAT WERE IT WE WERE HAVING A PROBLEM IN THE CRISIS RIGHT NOW WITH THE PLASTICS. BECAUSE IT'S CONSERVATIVE AND SO YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE DO ONE THING OVER JUST TO THAT ONE THING WHICH IS IN THE OTHER THING AHLERS SANTA SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF OF ABILITY TO RECYCLE AND AND REVIEWS. ARE WE WE ARE YOUR YOUR I HATE YOU YEAH WELL RIGHT NOW WE'RE HAVING A BILL WE'RE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH RECYCLING PLASTIC BECAUSE CHINA'S DECIDED TO STOP TAKING OUR RECYCLABLES. AND SO PART OF IT IS YES HAVING OUR OWN HOME GROWN ABILITY TO RECYCLE AND PART OF IT IS REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION OF SIMPLY IS PLASTICS. AND SO WE HAVE TO DO IT ALL IS THAT THERE'S NOT ONE ANSWER TO IT. A SIGNAL MORE COMMON SIDE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL -- THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE SOMETHING IS RECYCLABLE THAT IT'S OFF THE HOOK WHEN WE KNOW BECAUSE WE SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HEAR IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED. THEY'RE EITHER BEING LAND FILLED OR IF THEY GO OVERSEAS SOMETIMES ARE BEING BURNED. AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP IN THE OCEAN AND WHEN DOES IT END ENDS WHEN WE STOP PULLING WELLS OUT OF THE OCEAN. WHO ARE DEAD BECAUSE OUR STOMACHS ARE FILLED WITH PLASTIC THAT THEY CAN'T DIGEST SO? REDUCING THE SOURCE OF ALL OF THIS POLLUTION IS GOING TO BE A HUGE PART OF THE EQUATION AND THIS SEEMS TO ME LIKE LOW HANGING FRUIT. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION IS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I DON'T KNOW. HOW TO THE PACE CONTAINERS FIGURE INTO THIS GIVEN THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME SANITARY ISSUES SO JUST THINK ABOUT ALL THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD? BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE SUPPORT -- AND I'LL JUST DO A QUICK ON WE'RE NOT CUTTING TO PLEASE BECAUSE NOT IT'S NOT AS STANDARD YOU WALK IN EVERY HOTEL ROOM YOU DON'T SEC TWO BASE THERE. AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF POSITIVE A KIND OF ISSUE WITH CONTAMINANTS RAPID. PROCESS I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT INTEND TO COVER TO PAY JUST JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO EVERYONE BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT COME UP THAT WE TALK ABOUT WITH THE INDUSTRY. ARE THOSE DETAILS BECAUSE THE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS WHEN IT COMES TO A BILL LIKE THIS IS GOOD IMPACT SO MANY. HOTEL ROOMS AND HOTELS THAT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE INDUSTRY HAS PROVEN THAT YOU'VE SEEN IT WITH THE BUT THE TOWEL ON THE BED SHE CLEANING WHEN THEY HAVE SIGNS ALL BUT IT SEEMS THE MONEY IT'S ALSO WRITING TO DO. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT WILL SAVE INDUSTRY MONEY AND IT'S ALSO THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND SO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA BECAUSE OF THE WILLINGNESS OF THE INDUSTRY TO WORK WITH US. THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND UP OF PUT COMPROMISED POSITIONS OF YOU'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY WELL TOGETHER ALREADY AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL AS WELL A TO SUMMER STONE -- FOR HAVING A SELECT COMMITTEE THAT REALLY SPREAD THIS IDEA HAS WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT. AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BORROW THE SHAMPOO YOU CAN BRING YOUR OWN BOTTLE. OKAY WITH THAT WE HAVE A WE NEED A MOTION A SECOND. OKAY. OUR CAN I MAKE. A MOVE IT WE HAVE A SECOND. OKAY ABOVE IT AND ALSO I THINK THAT. WITH ACT MAY HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM EIGHTEEN A. B.

WHAT TYPE OF METRIC THEY WANTED MANUFACTURES USE WHEN REPORTING AND AS A RESULT THE DATA REPORTED? CAME IN PERCENTAGES POUNDS KILOGRAMS AND A NUMBER OF BOTTLES USED AS A RESULT THE INFORMATION DOES NOT ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFYING THE AMOUNT OF VIRGIN PLASTIC AND RECYCLE PLASTIC USED. IN PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR AS OPPOSED TO BE AMENDED THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE CLIMBERS TO REPORT DATA I'M RECYCLE MATERIAL INCLUDING. GRADE MATERIAL THEY PRODUCE IN THE PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR THE GOAL IS TO SET UP AN ANNUAL SNAPSHOT OF THE FOOD GRADE PELA TIES MATERIAL THAT IS BEING PRODUCED IN. THE STATE TO SEE IF THEY CAN SUPPLY THE NECESSARY FEEDSTOCK FOR THE VARIOUS PROPOSED MINIMUM CONTENT LEVELS FOR BEVERAGE BOTTLES UNDER THE C. R. V. PROGRAM. AT NEW POLICIES PROMOTING RECYCLE CONTENT ARE CONSIDERED IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND CAL RECYCLE TO NOT ONLY KNOW HOW MUCH RECYCLED MATERIAL IS IN THE STATE BUT ALSO HAVE USEFUL STANDARDIZED INFORMATION TO BETTER INFORM THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS A FEDERICA MCGREEVEY MIKEY WITH THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- PATRICK MAGEE ON BEHALF ABA AND JUST CONSIDERING YOUR TIME IN THE LIFT THE THINGS YOU HAVE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT. IT IS SUPPORT [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS THERE ANYBODY WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SIGNAL BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY COMMENTS OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY THOUGHT TO WE HAVE A MOTION. MOVED AND SECONDED WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND CLEAVER ALL CALL PLEASE THANKS I DON'T TWENTY FIVE A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY AYE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA. LARA AYE CHAU. EGGMAN GARCIA LIMóN. MATHIS. MATHIS I MCCARTY MELENDEZ MELENDEZ AYE MURATSUCHI STONE. STONE I FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT WE HAVE MISTER O'DONNELL WITH. ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WEBER SECOND FULL PLEASE PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AT ELEVEN NINETY FIVE WHICH CARS CARP TO ALLOW OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO GENERATE AN INNOVATIVE PRODUCTION METHOD CREDIT. UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FOR USING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS TO DISPLACE THEIR EXISTING USE OF TRADITIONAL. NATURAL GAS. THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OR ELSE CFS IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF CLEAN. LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO INTENDED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DURING THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF PRODUCING TRANSPORTATION FUELS. AS SUCH THE PROGRAM ALLOWS OIL REFINING OPERATIONS TO GENERATE% LC OF AS CREDITS WHEN SWITCHING FROM FOR TRADITIONAL NATURAL GAS TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE SEEKS TO EXPAND THIS OPTION TO OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS REQUIRED BY ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY METHODS. THIS MAKES THE PROCESS LESS CARBON INTENSIVE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE LC OF US. THIS BILL ALSO ASSIST IN CREATING ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL USES FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. THE ABSENCE OF A HAVE A HEALTHY RENEWABLE GAS MARKET HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO FIND INVESTMENT. TO CAPTURE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF METHANE DERIVED FROM ORGANIC WASTE AS REMINDER METHANE IS A POTENT GLOBAL WARMING GAS THAT IS THIRTY FOUR TIMES THIRTY FOUR TIMES. MORE POWERFUL THAN CARBON DIOXIDE AT TRAPPING THE EARNERS HEAT OVER A ONE HUNDRED YEAR PERIOD. WELL THIS BILL REPRESENTS A MODEST USE OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE FINDS ADDITIONAL END USERS FOR WHAT FOR FOR WHATEVER IS POSSIBLE. AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE ASSISTS IN CREATING A MARKET FOR MATH THING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DISSIPATE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE GHQ FOOT PRINT OF ALL OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS INTERSTATE. IN HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS THE CALIFORNIA. STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. IN THE STATUS OF SEASON ELECTRICAL WORKERS -- WE'RE HERE TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- IT TODAY YOU KNOW MY MEMBERS -- BOTH WORK AT MANY OF THESE. OIL REFINERIES AND IN THE IN THE OIL PATCH. AS WELL AS IN THIS NEW EMERGING INDUSTRY OF BIO GAS AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS -- COMMONSENSE MEASURE. CURRENTLY -- INDUSTRIAL USERS -- YOU KNOW -- OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS. IF THEY PURCHASE SOLAR POWER. THEY CAN GET OFFSETS FOR THE PURCHASE OF THAT SOLAR POWER REGARDLESS OF OF WHERE THAT POWER IS GENERATED AND PUT ON TO THE GRID. BUT IN IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THE BIO GAS. IT HAVE TO BE PIPED DIRECTLY TO THE FACILITY. WE WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THE MOLECULES AND ELECTRONS IN THIS INSTANCE SHOULD BOTH. BE TREATED EQUALLY. WE THINK THAT THIS WAS A HUGE BENEFIT TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO THEIR BURGEONING BIO GAS INDUSTRY AND TO THE FOLKS. MY MEMBERS WHO WORK IN LABOR EVERY DAY IN THE OIL PATCH SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE WOULD -- DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE PAY US OVER THE CALIFORNIA BEEN PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION. SOME MODEST BILL IT JUST GIVES US ANOTHER INCENTIVE TO BUILD TO PRODUCE OIL AND GAS. IN A WAY THAT REDUCES RGH TWO FOOT PRINT -- AGAIN WE THINK IT'S VERY MODEST THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL. THAT IS GOOD NO -- BECAUSE US TO TRY TO PRODUCE MORE GASOLINE OR CRUDE OIL FROM CALIFORNIA THAT'S SIMPLY A DEMAND QUESTION THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS THIS JUST SAYS AS LONG AS WE'RE PRODUCING. OIL IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN AVAIL OURSELVES TO THIS INCENTIVE TO DO SO IN A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. I JUST WANT ONCE AGAIN REALLY QUICKLY THE BENEFITS OF METHANE ARE HUGE. IF WE CAN USE MECHANIC METHANE STREAM INSTEAD OF USING A FOSSIL FUEL BASED NATURAL GAS TO TO HEAT OUR WATER TO MAKE THIS TEAM TO DO THE IN FINANCE OR RECOVERY. I THINK THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT RECENTLY -- WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS SUCH AS BY THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT THAT AVENUE WILL NATURAL GAS COME FROM CALIFORNIA SOURCES. THUS THE METHANE REDUCTION IS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH A METHANE SOURCES BE A DAIRY ORGANIC -- LANDFILL WASTE IN YOUR DISTRICT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR DISTRICTS SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FRIEDMAN MEMBERS NEED TO COOK FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MEMBERS -- FROM EVERY SECTOR OF THE R. G. INDUSTRY INCLUDING ORGANIZED LABOR UTILITIES AND PRODUCERS OF OVER NORTH AMERICA. WE SUPPORT ALL SUSTAINABLE AND USES OF OUR ENERGY AND THAT INCLUDES WHEN IT IS USED AS A PROCESS YOU'LL TO LOWER THE CARBON INTENSITY OF OTHER FUELS OF IN PROGRAMS LIKE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. AND WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY -- MODEST AND APPROPRIATE BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND FOR AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE AS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS P. ANTHONY THOMAS RIP IN THE CALIFORNIAN GAS PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. NATALIE MAX ON BEHALF OF SEE OUR IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. HI LAUREN COLEMAN BE ALPHA SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. CIRCLE CALIFORNIA POSES AB ONE ONE NINE FIVE THIS BILL WOULD OPEN UP THE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS ND BY DOING SO WOULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS ON CLEAN ENERGY POLICY. AND DELAY OUR SHIFT TO CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE PUT FORWARD IN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER THIS BILL WOULD ALSO UNDER CUT THE NON COMBUSTION CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES THAT SOME FIELDS ARE DEVELOPING. SUCH AS USING SOLAR STEAM TO EXTRACT AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT WOULD END UP PRESERVING COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY AND DISCOURAGE THE TRANSITION TO NON COMBUSTION TACK. IN AREAS THAT NEED THAT TRANSITION. FOR EXAMPLE MANY FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY RELY ON USING THERMAL ENHANCEMENT RECOVERY HE'S AREAS COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM NON COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY TO HELP MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THEIR SUFFERING FROM SUCH AS AIR POLLUTION. INSTEAD THIS BILL WOULD LOCK THOSE AREAS AND RELYING ON DIRTY COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGIES. THE STATE NEEDS TO WEAN ITSELF OFF OF ITS DEPENDENCE ON GAS AND THIS BILL WOULD WORK IN OPPOSITION TO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE I BRING TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MATHIS. YOU KNOW I I ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING SO TALK ABOUT WINNING PEOPLE OF A GAS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ALL THIS NATURAL NATURAL GAS OCCURRING IN THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE IT AND USE IT AND GET IN THE PIPELINE -- YEAH I'VE GOT A VERY DISADVANTAGED DISTRICT IN WE WE HAVE A AREA AND I I WON'T CALL THE THE TOWN OUT BY NAME -- BUT THE RESIDENTS ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPTION. TO GET FREE SOLAR. AND SWITCH ALL OF THEIR APPLIANCES OVER TO ELECTRIC. THEY REFUSED THE FREE OFFER OF SOLAR ELECTRIC APPLIANCES. BECAUSE THEY PREFER THE ABILITY TO USE GAS STOVES. AND INSTEAD HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING THE LOCAL AREA -- TO TEAM UP WITH OUR GAS COMPANIES AND OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY PLANT THAT'S ACTUALLY CAPTURING METHANE FROM DERRY DIGEST STATION -- TO USE THAT NATURAL NATURAL GAS -- AS A MATTER. ID AND I BELIEVE THIS WOULD ACTUALLY LOWER THE COST -- QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY. OF THAT NATURAL NATURAL GAS AND HELP AND MOVE FORWARD TO CREATE A MARKET -- FOR THAT MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE MOST DISADVANTAGED IN OUR STATE. I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS ROAD ON ALL -- TO TO DO THIS AND REALLY HELP DRIVE DOWN THOSE COST AND MAKE NATURAL NATURAL GAS MORE AFFORDABLE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA NEEDED THE MOST THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS EGGMAN. THE GAME IS PARTY PRESENTATION BUT MY MY ESTIMATE WHAT A LOT OF TEARS IN MY DISTRICT IT IT IS. ONLY CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS ONLY TO BE RECEIVE THE CREDITS IN CALIFORNIA ALL CALIFORNIA. ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE. FOR THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT THE THE METHANE HAS TO COME THAT DISPLACEMENT HAS TO BE FROM CALIFORNIA SO AS TO BE ACCEPTED YEAH EXCEPT YEAH THE COUPLE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- I DO THINK WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US AND ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I WILL SAY THAT I DO -- WANT TO JUST PUT OUT THERE THAT THE LC ABOUT L. L. C. F. F. IS VERY. IS A VERY COMPLICATED SET OF REGULATIONS AND I DO THINK THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD -- CAN REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS WORKABLE AND SUPPORTS OUR COMMON OBJECTIVE OF NEW NOTHING CAPTURE PROJECTS MY ONE CONCERN IS THAT. THIS ISN'T WORK SOMEHOW SO THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE EXISTING PROJECTS SO THAT YOU MOVE THOSE CREDITS OVER IT HAS TO IT FOR THIS TO WORK AS AS ADVERTISED. THESE HAVE TO BE NEW PROJECTS SO THAT WE'RE GETTING -- NEW REDUCTIONS SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE RECORD THAT THAT'S OUR INTENTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I HOPE THAT THERE RESOURCE BOARD IS. UP TO THE TASK OF BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT. WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION I BELIEVE. WE HAVE A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE -- AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO. MY MY ONE QUESTION IS WILL THE BILL SUPPORT NEW METHANE CAPTURE PROJECTS. IS THAT YOUR YOUR COMMITMENT RATHER THAN TRYING TO PERCH ON TEXTING PRICE SO I MEAN I I CAN'T SPEAK TO EVERY PARTICULAR TRANSACTION BUT I CAN I CAN'T SAY A COUPLE THINGS. ONE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH METHANE CAPTURE IN THE STATE IS AS WE THINK WE DO RIGHT AND SO AS WITH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SO CAL GAS IS COMMITMENT TO START. OFTEN INVOLUNTARY WINNABLE NATURAL GAS IN THEIR PIPELINE AND FOR ALL THE OTHER VARIOUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE -- ACROSS THE STATE WE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO FILL THE DEMAND THAT'S RIGHT THERE IN FACT WE HAVE ASKED. FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN A RETURN PHONE CALL IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS GONNA TAKE THERE'S GONNA BE COMPETITION FOR NEW PROJECTS. RIGHT NOW WE ACTUALLY COULDN'T DO WHAT'S IN THE BILL BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT THE SUPPLY SO IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE. NEW PRODUCTS NEW PROJECTS BUILT OUT IN ORDER TO GET THE GET THE SUPPLY IN THE PIPELINE AND DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN SO WE CAN DO THAT'S WEIRD MY UNDERSTAND IS WE'RE NOT THERE YET. SO MY ASSUMPTION IS BANNED FROM THE BEGINNING ONCE THAT AMENDMENT WAS PROFFERED THAT WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT NEW PROJECTS OKAY THANK YOU WITHOUT MISTER DONNA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THAT'S WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND WAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. I AM NINETEEN AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMAN AYE FLORA. CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LOW MOAN. MATHIS -- MATHIS AYE MCCARTY. MELENDEZ [inaudible] WROTE SURGERY [inaudible] STONE. STONE NO FOUR ONE THANK YOU FOR ONE LEAVE THE ROLL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE MISTER GLORIA WITH. FOR TWENTY THREE A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WE'RE STRUCTURE SAID THE EAGLES AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT AND DIRECT THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PROGRAM TRANSPARENCY. THE BOARD INCLUDES REPRESENTATION FROM ADDITIONAL SAN DIEGO AREA CITIES AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS IF PASSED A BEFORE TWENTY THREE WILL TAKE EFFECT ON MARCH FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE QUICKLY -- MADAM CHAIR I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY OF THE BILL. THIS BILL CORRECT ANOMALY -- IS CREATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE MANY MANY YEARS AGO -- BASICALLY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND REPRESENTATION THIS BOARD I BELIEVE WILL HELP US TO REACH A CLIMATE GOALS I AM REDUCE AIR POLLUTION OUR COMMUNITY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES I'D LIKE TO HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TRAVEL FROM SAN DIEGO DâN TALK VOID WITH THE ENVIRONMENT HEALTH COALITION AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS TO TELL US OF THESE FROM THE CITY OF NATIONAL CITY. WE CAN MAKE IT REALLY WORTHWHILE AND ASK A LOT OF REALLY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS IF YOU PREFER AS WELL. YOU CAN ASK THEM TO BE PUT ON THE WITNESS OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON -- DIANE TECH FOR IN DIRECTOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION WE'RE A FORTY YEAR OLD ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- TO CONFRONT THE UNJUST CONSEQUENCES OF POOR AIR QUALITY AND OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE A VERY LONG HISTORY OF WORKING FOR AIR QUALITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE BEEN MET WITH AN UNRESPONSIVE BOARD. THE HEALTH IMPACTS IN THE CONTINUED HIGH RATES OF CANCER AND ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATIONS AMONG CHILDREN ARE UNACCEPTABLE AND DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR ACTION. THE NEED FOR A DIVERSE REPRESENTATION ON THIS BOARD IS CLEAR. THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BOARD IS AN ANOMALY AMONG THE LARGE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE THE PRODUCT OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROVISIONS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO EXAM SAN DIEGO COUNTY FROM HAVING A DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE FORD. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE NEED FOR DIRECTED ACTION THROUGH CLEAR REQUIREMENTS IS EVIDENT FOR EXAMPLE BASIC TRANSPARENCY IN LACKEY IS LACKING IN AREAS WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE. VERY SIMPLY THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT MINUTES AND AGENDAS ARE NOT POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE -- THEY'RE BURIED IN THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- INFORMATION THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT -- BASIC PERMITTING WHEN WE FOLLOW THEIR INSTRUCTIONS AND SIGNED UP TO RECEIVE DATA -- WE RECEIVED ZERO DATE AND NONE OF THE DATA REQUEST MATCH THEIR CRITERIA-- WHEN WE DID THAT ON THE -- BAY AREA'S WEBSITE WE GOT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HITS SO THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT FOUR DOES NOT PROVIDE BUDGET INFORMATION THERE'S NO DETAILED INFORMATION AND NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE. AND LASTLY MONITORING DATA FROM EXISTING MONITORS TAKES YEARS TO BE PROCESS JUST LAST WEEK WE RECEIVE DATA FROM. TWENTY SIXTEEN SO IN CLOSING OTHER LARGE DISTRICTS HAVE ROBUST PUBLIC INFORMATION AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES AN AMBITIOUS EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS SAN DIEGO DESERVES AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. THAT ENCOURAGES AND SUPPORTS ITS KATE CAPABLE AND COMMITTED STAFF TO TAKE BOLD AND EFFECTIVE ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITH THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I KNOW THAT HOW THAT'S WHAT THE LAW SO LEASE AND I AM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NATIONAL CITY AND IT'S A CITY OF SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN **** ANY ACCOUNTING. NATIONAL CITY SUFFERS FROM SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AND AS A RESULT OF THESE CHALLENGES NATIONAL CITY HAS RECENTLY BEEN SELECTED TO BE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM. UNDER AB SIX ONE SEVEN OR SIX SEVENTEEN THE CITY OF NATIONAL CITY HAS RECOGNIZED THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. AND WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO IMPROVE OUR AIR QUALITY. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT INCLUDE THE NEW WEST SIDE COMMUNITY PLAN THAT RESOUNDS THE COMMUNITY TO CORRECT INCOMPATIBLE LAND USES. NATIONAL CITY ADOPTED THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ELEMENT IN A GENERAL PLAN AND IN THE STATE AND WHICH WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR SB ONE THOUSAND ADOPTED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE JUST COMPLETED THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO HUNDRED ONE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS RIGHT NEXT TO OUR A TRANSIT CENTER WITH THE HELP OF NINE MILLION DOLLARS. IN CAPITAL FUND TRADES. CAPITA RATE BUTTONS. WE NEED YOUR HELP TO ENABLE NATIONAL CITY IN ALL OF THE EIGHTEEN CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPROVING AIR QUALITY WE WANT OUR SEAT AT THE TABLE. OUR PERSPECTIVES AN INSIGHT INTO LOCAL AIR POLLUTION SOURCES OUR UNIQUE INVALUABLE INSIGHTS THAT ARE REPRESENT. OF REPRESENTATION WILL PROVIDE WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB. FOR TWENTY THREE THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. YEAH GOOD EVENING IN A BASKET ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ROOM TO SCIENCE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. LAUREN CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ROCKY RUSSIAN COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR HAPPY TO SUPPORT. I WILL BEAR AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT LIKE TO SPEAK. COUPLE OF TWEETERS. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS JONATHAN CLAY HERE ABOUT FOR THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO TO VOICE CONCERNS WITH THE MOST RECENT AMENDED VERSION OF AB -- FOR TWENTY THREE IN ITS PREVIOUS ITERATION WHEN THE BILL JUST DEALT WITH GOVERNANCE THE COUNTY AND CHOSEN TO REMAIN SILENT ON THAT. BUT WITH THE RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS -- WE FELT WE NEEDED TO RAISE SOME CONCERNS. THIS CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND A COUPLE DIFFERENT -- ISSUE AREAS FIRST OFF WE BELIEVE THAT IMPLEMENTATION FOR THOSE NEW SET OF AMENDMENTS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DISTRICT -- THE MANDATES TO DO WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WE ALSO THINK THERE'S A NUMBER REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- WEATHER RELATED TO PENDING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAVING TO MAKE THOSE PUBLIC WITHOUT HAVING THE FULL FACTS OF THE MATTER BEING DETERMINED -- WE ALSO FEEL THAT THERE'S WAYS INTERPRET THE LANGUAGE OF REQUIRE TIPSTERS AND OTHER TYPES OF COMMENTS HAVE TO BE MADE PUBLIC. THERE'S JUST SOME MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE LANGUAGE WE ALSO FEEL THAT -- THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT THE BILL REQUIRES THAT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BETTER -- HUGE WORKLOAD FOR THE DISTRICT IN VERY EXPENSIVE. FINALLY WE ALSO THINK -- THERE'S SOME -- MISSING CROSS REFERENCES FOR FEAR FORTY AND THAT OF THEIR OTHER ITEMS IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DONE OR IN PROCESS OF BEING DONE AND DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY BE MANDATE AND STATUTES. WITHOUT THOSE ARE CONCERNS. THANK YOU. CHAIR FREEDMAN RANDALL FRIEDMAN REPRESENTING THE NAVY AND MARINE CORPS ALSO VOICING CONCERNS. WITH SIX MAJOR INSTALLATIONS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY DEPENDENT ON A WIDE RANGE OF EQUIPMENT SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE A. P. C. D.. THIS BILL IS. A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US. WE ARE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE AUTHOR ON REQUESTED AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THE MILITARY'S UNIQUE MISSION NEEDS ARE FULLY CONSIDERED BY THIS NEW BOARD.

EGGMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE LIMóN. MATHIS NO MATHIS NO MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. WROTE SURGERY. STONE. BUT SOON I FOR ONE FORTY ONE BELIEVE THE REAL OPEN CRAFTED MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND NOW -- MISTER REAVIS WITH NINE THIRTY SIX AND SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IS PREPARED TO SAY I'M HAPPY WITH WHO I AM HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON BUT IT'S SEEMS TO BE EVENING TIME. BUT IT'S A IT'S IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO BE HERE -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I ALSO WANT TO THANK -- STAFF FOR NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE FOR A WORK ON THE ANALYSIS AND I ALSO GLADLY ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT I AM HAPPY HERE TO PRESENT A. B. -- NINE THREE SIX A BILL RELATED TO OIL SPILL RESPONSE A CONTINGENCY PLANNING. AND SO LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL. THAT IS BILLS INTENT. YOU KNOW IT'S A BILL ABOUT SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS -- AND SO CERTAINLY SEE THE THE KALAMAZOO RIVER OIL SPILL IN SOUTH CENTRAL MICHIGAN HAS BEEN CALLED THE BIGGEST OIL SPILL THAT YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ACCORDING TO FEDERAL AGENCIES A RUPTURED THIRTY INCH PIPELINE RESULTED IN A SPILL OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION GALLONS OF TAR SANDS OIL FROM ALBERTA CANADA. INTO THE KALAMAZOO. THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL WAS SEVERE. NEARLY FORTY MILES OF RIVER AND SHORELINES ARE POLLUTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES VOLUNTARILY LEFT THEIR HOMES. MOSTLY -- MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVELS OF OF OF BENZENE THAT HAD EVAPORATED FROM THE OIL INTO THE AIR. IT WAS -- BENZENE THAT HAD BEEN USED TO DILUTE THE HEAVY CRUDE. AND THIS EVENT TO THIS OIL SPILL. WITH SIGNIFICANT IT WAS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST SPILL OF TAR SANDS OIL. A TYPE OF NON FLOATING OIL THAT US AGENCIES WERE FORCED TO DEAL WITH. AND TO DATE THIS BILL REMAINS ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND COSTLIEST INLAND OIL SPILLS EVER REGISTERED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE BIGGEST AND COSTLIEST BECAUSE THE TYPICAL OIL SPILL CLEANUP METHODS DID NOT WORK THIS. THIS PARTICULAR HEAVY OIL IT DID NOT FLOAT ON WATER LIKE MOST OILS. TO EVERY ACTED VERY DIFFERENTLY. ONCE THIS BILL OCCURRED OVER TIME AS IT SAT IN THE WATER IT BECAME SUSPENDED IN THE WATER COLUMN EVENTUALLY THINKING. THE CALVET THE THE RIVER CLEANUP TOOK FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE. AND COST OVER ONE POINT -- TWO BILLION DOLLARS NOT INCLUDING THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SPENT IN COMPANY FIGHT TO INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY THREE MAJOR REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CAN REFINE THIS TYPE OF HEAVY CRUDE. TAR SANDS OIL HAS BEEN IN PRODUCTION SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND CURRENTLY ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT HOWEVER PRODUCTION HAS BEEN SCALING UP. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE US ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR CANADA EXPORTED A RECORD AMOUNT OF TAR SANDS OIL TO THE UNITED STATES. EXPORTS ARE TRANSPORTED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE USING VARIOUS METHODS INCLUDING BY C. ALONG OUR PACIFIC OCEAN COASTLINE. AND IN LIGHT OF THIS THIS LEGISLATION. AB NINE THIRTY SIX AGAIN IS ABOUT SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS. IT'S SIX THIS IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO ENHANCE OIL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY IN CALIFORNIA BY PROVIDING INFORMATION ON NON FLOATING OIL MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE STATE TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS. AND IT RESPONSIBLY SEEKS TO UPDATE AND STRAIGHTENING CALIFORNIA'S TOOLS FOR PLANNING AND PREPARING FOR UNANTICIPATED FUTURE OIL SPILLS. OF NON FOR AN OIL. THE CALIFORNIA COAST ALL TWELVE HUNDRED MILES ALONG THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS ONE OF OUR STATE NATURAL TREASURES. AND IT'S CLEARLY A MAJOR ECONOMIC RESOURCE FOR OUR STATE. NON FOR THE OIL PRESENTS A UNIQUE AND SERVICE RISK TO OUR COAST. HERE CALIFORNIA IF YOU TAKE THE TIME AND REVIEW CALIFORNIA'S OIL SPILL -- THE CONTINGENCY PLAN IT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. THAT OUR STATE OIL RESPONSE CAPABILITIES ASSUME. THE OIL FLOATS. WHEN IT COMES TO NON FORTY OILS HEAVIER OILS LIKE TAR SANDS THE TRUTH IS WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT? WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THIS WILL IMPACT IN BEHAVIOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS BILL OCCURS. WE CAN HAVE A POINT TO THE KALAMAZOO RIVER INCIDENT THE EFFECTS THAT NON UT -- HAD ON THE RIVER AND ON THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENT. THAT INCIDENT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR THAT ONCE ALL THE OIL STARTED TO SINK IT MADE THINGS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT AND VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO CLEAN UP. RESPOND AS WERE CLEARLY NOT AS PREPARED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION AND CLEAN IT UP AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- IT'S AGAIN THIS BILL IS ABOUT SAFETY AND PREPAREDNESS -- FOR OUR STATE AND ALONG OUR COAST I HAVE HERE SOME WITNESSES AND I WILL ALLOW THEM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THANK MANAGER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM -- JOSHUA AXELROD FOR WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FOSSIL FUELS PROGRAM AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE APPRECIATE MISTER REVERSES LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING AB NINE THIRTY SIX TO ADDRESS THE THREATS THAT NON PUTTING AYEOPPOSED TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. AND NATURAL RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE. THE BILL PROVIDES FOR PRUDENT AND NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS TO CONFRONT THESE THREATS SPECIFICALLY -- I'LL HAVE IT THREE THINGS -- PROPOSED NEW INFRASTRUCTURE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE IS POISED TO OPEN CALIFORNIA'S REFINING MARKETS TO AN INFLUX OF NON FLOATING AROUND. CARRIED MOSTLY BY OCEAN TANKERS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES AREAS. IN LIGHT OF THIS POTENTIALITY AND TO COPE WITH NON VOTING ARE BEING TRANSPORTED INTO OUR STATE NOW AB NINE THIRTY SIX PROVIDE STATE AGENCIES AND SPELL RESPOND AS WITH INCREASED INFORMATION. REGARDING CHARACTERISTICS OF OILS ENTERING THE STATE AND CLARITY AS TO THE TIMING AND TYPES OF RESPONSE THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IN THE EVENT OF A LARGE WATER BORNE SPELL OF NON FLOATING AROUND. AB NINE THIRTY SIX EXPANDS THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF OPERATORS MOVING NON PUTTING OIL INTO THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT COSTS OF CLEAN UP. SHOULD THEY ARISE ARE NOT BORN BY THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. AB NINE THIRTY SIX OF THE COMMONSENSE BELT THAT WILL BENEFIT FIRST RESPONDERS COMMUNITIES AND CALIFORNIA'S PRECIOUS NATURAL RESOURCES. BY IMPROVING OUR PREPAREDNESS FOR A POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING ACCIDENT INVOLVING NON PUTTING OILS WE ARE QUITE BE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT THEIR MEDICARE. MEMBERS TIME I'M THEN I CAN BURKE STAFF ATTORNEY PERCENT DISCO BAY KEEPER I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER REAVIS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WELL AS MANY STAFF. ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE MINORITY SEE FOR TAKING TIME OUT FROM HIS PATERNITY LEAVE AND HIS HIS NEW BABY. AS IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER REAVIS CALIFORNIA NEEDS THIS ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IN THE EVENT OF A NON POLLUTING SPELL. TO SUMMARIZE -- THERE'S AN IMMINENT THREAT OF MORE OF THIS TYPE WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA THE RISK OF THIS BILL IS CATASTROPHIC. OUR SOLUTION IS THREE PARTS FIRST. FIRST OF ALL FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH SECOND OF ALL WE MUST PREPARE FOR THIS THREAT USING THE BEST TECHNOLOGY WE CAN GET. AND THIRD THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T BE SADDLED WITH THIS THE COST OF A SPELL. THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IS THE STUDY THIS ISSUE TWICE FIRST IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND THEN WHAT MORE RECENTLY. FOUND THIS THREAD TO BE SEVERE AND FOUND THAT WE ARE UNDER PREPARED. SAN FRANCISCO BAY IS SPECIFICALLY UNDER THREAT -- THERE'S GONNA BE MORE THERE COULD BE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED IT'S NOT BARGES AND TANKERS CARRYING ON PUTTING OIL ON THE WEST COAST IF CURRENTLY PLANNED PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED. FIRST RESPONDERS MUST KNOW WHAT IS COMING. EACH TANKER CARRIES AN ADDED RISK OF SPELL AND SPILLS IMPORT MEAN ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES COULD BE HIT PARTICULARLY HARD. CALIFORNIA'S FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR COASTAL ECONOMY HAS A LOT TO LOSE FROM A SPELL. EVER GONNA SHIP THIS THAT STUFF THROUGH SEPARATIST KOBE AND ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO IMAGINE THE SCENARIO TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN TO REDUCE CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE. ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MELISSA ROMERO CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. I FURTHER THAN ON BEHALF OF BOTTLING CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. VICTORIA AROUND YOU KNOW ME AS IN OUR DC BUT I'M SPEAKING TODAY FOR THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JENNIFER SAVAGE SURFRIDER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LAUREN COM SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. TREES A BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF HILL THE BAY IN THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IF ONE OF THE WITNESSES COULD PLEASE GIVE THEIR SEAT TO THE OPPOSING WITNESS THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR P. ANTHONY THOMAS WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- WE'RE WE'RE IN WE'RE IN OPPOSITION -- TO AB NINE THIRTY SIX FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THIS -- MADAM CHAIR THAT I WANT TO THANK MISTER REAVIS WE WORKED WE'VE WORKED ON TO OTHER BUILT ASIDE FROM THIS WOMAN. AND I HE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD AND A PERSON WHO I AM GLAD TO HAVE KNOWN HOW TO NOTE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING IN THE FUTURE. BUT IN SO FAR AS A. B. -- NINE THIRTY SIX IS CONCERNED. THERE'S NO ARGUMENT ON HOW DAMAGING ANY OIL SPILL IS. BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY VERY CLEARLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPORT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH THE IMPORT SOLD WHEN PRODUCTION IN A STATE GOALS DOWN THE DEMAND IS STILL THERE SO WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON IMPORTS. ENTERS TALKING ABOUT THE DAMAGE OF IMPORTS WE'VE SAID THAT ALL THE TIME THAT MORE IN STATE PRODUCTION IS ACTUALLY BETTER CONSIDERING THE ROUTE THE REGULATION THAT WE FUNCTION UNDER. THE TO PROPONENTS MENTION THE ISSUES WITH IMPORTS OF OIL SO WE SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MAYBE WE NEED TO IN FACT INCREASE PRODUCTION STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE GOVERNED AND BECAUSE OF OUR ORAL BEING THE BEST IN THE CLEANEST IN THE NATION. AS THE BILL READS MADAM CHAIR THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE OFFICE OF SPILL RESPONSE ADMINISTRATOR TO ESTABLISH A CRITERION FOR SEPARATE RATING. OUR RATING LEVEL FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO ADDRESS NON FLOATING. OIL INDUSTRY HAS ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE OF WORLD BILL DATING BACK TO AB -- ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN MEMBER LAMONT CHAPTER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS WELL AS SB EIGHT SIXTY ONE WHICH IS ALSO CHAPTER IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND TIMING CRAFTING THESE TO COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. TO SUPPLEMENT SB FOUR CHAPTER IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS NOW UNDERGOING STATUTORY REVIEW FOR A TWENTY TWENTY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WILL INCLUDE. OIL SPILLS YOUR TIME IS UP YOU CAN JUST FINISH UP IN LATE WITNESSES MAY HAVE MADAM CHAIR I I I UNDERSTAND WE'RE ALWAYS ON TIME LINES BUT BUT I WERE. OKAY LET ME JUST SAY THIS. THERE ARE CHAPTER BILL THAT ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE THERE WAS A REPORT COMING OUT THAT WILL ADDRESS OR THIS BILL DOUBLE INCLUDE NON FLOATING. IF IN FACT NON FLOATING IS NOT INCLUDED I AM SURE THAT THIS BODY WILL GO BACK AND READ AND READ AND READ KINDLE AND RE SURFACED AND DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE THANK YOU. EARLY EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RESENTED WITH THE WESTERN PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION BE VERY BRIEF. ENCOURAGED THAT THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AND PROVIDING INFORMATION AS TO YOU KNOW HOW WE CURRENTLY OPERATE AND TAKE THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY.

A DECADE AGO CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY A FUTURE THREAT BUT TODAY IT IS HERE IN FULL FORCE BOTH ON LAND AND IN THE OCEAN -- AND WHILE MITIGATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS IS CRITICAL TO A STABLE CLIMATE IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR EFFORTS. TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGES THAT ARE ALREADY UPON US -- AND THAT ARE PREDICTED TO CERTAINLY GET WORSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND THAT'S WHY I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT A. B. AT NINE SEVENTY FIVE CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE IS GOING TO REQUIRE ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER INCLUDING THOSE OF US IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT ALSO OUR FRIENDS AND OUR NEIGHBORING STATES -- AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE PACIFIC OR CONFRONTING SIMILAR CHALLENGES TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE AND MAXIMIZING KNOWLEDGE GENERATION.

THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER SAVAGE ON THE CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER FOR SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. SURFRIDER WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR BY A SMALL GROUP OF SURFERS DETERMINED TO PROTECT THE WORLD'S OCEAN BEACHES IN WAVES. AT LAST COUNT WE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY VOLUNTEER LE CHAPTERS AT STUDENT CLUBS IN THE US INCLUDING TWENTY CHAPTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M VERY PLEASED TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI NINE SEVEN FIVE TODAY. AND WILL NOT EVERYONE WHO IS PART OF SURFRIDER SERVICE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY MOST OF US DO AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR CO SURFERS ARE AMONG THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES. READ THE BEACH IN THE WATER IN THE WATER EVERY DAY COLLECTIVELY. A MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S BEACHES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ARE EXPECTED TO DISAPPEAR IN THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS DO YOU SEE LEVEL RISE. IT'S ALSO LIKELY TO DO MANY IF NOT MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC SURF BREAKS WHICH IS A RATHER SAD FOLLOW UP TO AN ACTIVITY THAT WE JUST MADE THE STATE'S SPORT. AND WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE GET TO PLAY THE COAST MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A PRIORITY ISSUE BUT SEA LEVEL RISE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY OUT WAIT EVEN WILD FIRES AND EARTHQUAKES. ACCORDING TO A MAJOR NEW STUDY BY USGS RESEARCHERS AND OTHER SCIENTIST THEY FOUND THAT RISING SEAS AND STORMS WILL DEVASTATE CALIFORNIA AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY WITH IMPACTS OCCURRING AS EARLY AS TWENTY FORTY AND AS YOU KNOW THE FISCAL IMPACTS OUR ENVIRONMENT TRANSLATE INTO SOCIO ECONOMIC ONCE BOTH. THE COAST AND INLAND AREAS WILL FACE MAJOR FINANCIAL LOSSES. WITH ALL THIS AT RISK CLIMATE CHANGE MUST BE ADDRESSED IN COORDINATION WITH AT A MINIMUM OUR NEAREST NEIGHBORS WHICH THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING THAT ALMOST WHOLLY THROUGH UNILATERAL ACTIONS BY PAST GOVERNORS. AB NINE SEVEN FIVE AND IT'S FOR ENGAGEMENT IN MULTI STATE IN INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. AND ENSURE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE STRENGTHENING THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THESE EFFORTS GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AN OVERDUE AND NECESSARY LEADERSHIP ROLE.

SEVEN ZERO SEVEN ZERO THE BILL IS OUT LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN AND YOUR NEXT BILL PLEASE THANK YOU. I WANTED TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AS OIL PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS GROWING CONCERN FROM OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND STATE REGULATORS THE OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE COULD BE DESERTED LEAVING THE TAX [inaudible] THE LEAVING TAXPAYERS TO ADDRESS THE RISK AND COVER THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.% AT TO PLUG WELLS WHEN THEY ENTER INTO LEASES WITH THE STATE TO DRILL TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE OIL AND GAS -- BONDS ARE REQUIRED FROM OPERATORS AS PREREQUISITES TO OBTAIN PERMISSION TO DRILL WELLS IN THE EVENT A COMPANY WHETHER THROUGH BANKRUPTCY OR OTHER. EVENT CANNOT TO FILL THE STATURE IT THE STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO PLUG IN A BAND IN THE WELLS THE STATE CAN COLLECT IN OIL AND GAS. SURETY BOND TO PAY FOR THE CLEANUP THE CURRENT BOND LEVELS ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO COVER ME MEDIATION AND THE STATE MUST STEP UP TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM BEARING THE COST OF DESERTED OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS. BASED ON CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES COSTS PAYERS COSTS TO TAXPAYERS COULD BE AS HIGH AS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION PER TEN THOUSAND OIL WELLS. ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY SEVEN DOUBLES MINIMUM BONDING REQUIRING REQUIREMENTS FOR ON SHORE OIL AND GAS WELLS TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTED FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES IN THE EVENT A COMPANY FAILS TO FILL THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DECOMMISSION. AND REMEDIATE OIL PRODUCTION SITES THIS BILL ALSO STRENGTHENED THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES DAGR AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL BONDING REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE LIKELY COST FOR FULL REMEDIATION AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A BALANCED APPROACH THAT WILL PROTECT TAXPAYERS BY ENSURING THE STATE IS NOT LIABLE. IN THE EVENT AN OPERATOR FAILS TO FILL THEIR DUTY I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MELISSA FROM METAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEGAL CONSERVATION VOTERS AND UNFIT THOUGHT IT ON THOUGH WITH OB ON A LOT OF ON TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SO EVER LIMóN -- GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS THERE ARE CURRENTLY THIRTY THOUSAND IDLE OIL WELLS IN THE STATE WITH NEARLY A QUARTER OF WHICH HAVE NOT PRODUCED OIL IN THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IF THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND IDA WELLS IN THE STATE BECOME ORPHANED OR ABANDONED IT COULD EXPOSE TAXPAYERS TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY. IN ADDITION TO THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO INCREASE BOND LEVELS FOR OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT FOR ON SHORE WELLS WHICH MAKE UP 97% OF ALL OF THE WELLS IN THE STATE. BOND LEVELS ARE ADEQUATE AND THAT THE STATE HAS THE TOOLS TO INCREASE THOSE BOND RATES IF NEEDED TO COVER THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATION AND THAT SECOND PIECE IS REALLY KEY BECAUSE THE COST TO PLUG. IN A BAND AN ON SHORE OIL WELLS VARIES GREATLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING WELL DEPTH AND PROXIMITY TO SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINSTCLIMATE CHANGE AND PART OF THAT FIGHT IS TO THOUGHTFULLY PLANNED AND MANAGED. FOR THE MANAGE DECLINE AND OUR RELIANCE ON ALL ON FOSSIL FUELS. IN TO MAKE SURE THAT LIABILITY FOR MEDIATION COSTS ARE PLACED ON THE PUBLIC THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ALREADY BEEN HARMED. BY THE POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS BECAUSE BY THIS INDUSTRY. AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A CRITICAL STEP THAT THE STATE MUST TAKE IN ORDER TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS AND IT'S PART OF AN OVERALL STRATEGY. TO THE FOR THE MANAGE DECLINE OF OIL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU IS ANYBODY ELSE WHICH SPEAK SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL NAM BEHALF OF BOTTOM LINE CALIFORNIA I'LL BE BRIEF AND JUST OFFER TWO EXAMPLES I THINK THAT I THINK REALLY EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR IT FOR THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW JUST LAST YEAR WE HAD A IN THE BUDGET -- OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BEING YOUR MARKED -- TO DO THE REMEDIATION FOR PLATFORM HOLLY AND RINCON ISLAND. ALTHOUGH THOSE WERE OFF SHORE -- I THINK IT EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO TO REALLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS -- HEAD ON BEFORE WE WE FIND OURSELVES IN ADDITIONAL SITUATIONS WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO FOOT THE BILL -- FOR THOSE REMEDIATION EFFORTS AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION TO IS THAT SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN YOU HANDLE -- THE LAST UPDATE OF THESE -- INDEMNITY BONDS -- WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF NEW ACTIONS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT ACTUALLY ROLL BACK PROTECTIONS VOTE FOR THE WAY THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR ARE. SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE -- WITH THE THE CASE IN POINT BEING THE ROLL BACKS RUN THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT -- BY THE CURRENT TO ACTING I INTERIOR SECRETARY MISTER BURN HARD -- AND THE CONTINUED A PUSH. TO TO REMOVE THOSE PROTECTIONS SO IT REALLY JUST ELEVATES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE AND THE NEED AND THAT. ULTIMATELY THE DESIRE OF LEGISLATORS -- LIKE SOMEONE FROM THE MON TO CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS OTHER PEOPLE IN SUPPORT VICTORIA ROME WITH ENERGY SEE IN SUPPORT. LAUREN COMMA SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. JAMIE GO ON BEHALF OF A SOUL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR P. ANTHONY THOMAS REPRESENT CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- GIVEN THE OUR LET ME BE BRIEF AND JUST GET TO THE POINT. AND THAT IS -- AS COMPELLING. AS THE THE TESTIMONY WAS -- WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROADJUST RECENTLY AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE CHAPLAIN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN MISTER WILLIAMS. DID EXACTLY WHAT FIVE EIGHTY FIVE IS ATTEMPTING TO DO. THERE'S A SECTION FIVE THAT BILL IT TALKED ABOUT THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH WELL THAT IS LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND FEET. FORTY DOLLARS FOR EACH WELL THAT IS TEN THOUSAND OR MORE DEEP AND THEN OF COURSE WE GO TO THE INDEMNITY BONDS OF WHICH THE AUTHOR SPEAKING ABOUT. HIS WAS SET UP ON A TIERED SYSTEM I PERSONALLY WITH MY CEO HELP NEGOTIATE THIS PARTICULAR DEAL. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOREIGN OPERATE HAVING FIFTY OR FEWER WELLS IN THE STATE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ANY OPERATOR HAVING MORE THAN FIFTY BUT NO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED WELLS. TWO MILLION DOLLAR BOND THERE'S A THREE MILLION DOLLAR BOND AND OF COURSE THERE ARE PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE RANGING FROM. ONE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WELL. NOW IF IF IF IT'S THIS IF IT'S THE GOAL OF JETS TO INCREASE ANOTHER BOND AND AND ASSURE DIMOND AND THEN SO BE IT. BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REAL POLICY MADAM CHAIR TRUE POLICY AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH. IS THIS BEING APPLIED. FAIRLY AND ADEQUATELY TO PROTECT WHEN SHE REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT THEN I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF AND HOPEFULLY. ANSWER IT ACCORDINGLY THIS INDUSTRY HAS IN FACT HAD THOSE BONDS TAKEN CARE OF THERE WAS ALSO A BILL BY FORMER MEMBER LOS WILK SB -- SIX SIX FIVE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IT DID THE SAME THING SO ARBITRARILY. OR SPECIFICALLY RAISING BOND EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHT. BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHT THERE'S GOING TO BE DESERTED WELLS. IT IS INCONCEIVABLE ESPECIALLY AGAIN WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE REGULATED UNDER THE MOST STRICT REGULATIONS IN THE COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD I THINK THE BILL SHOULD BE HELPED -- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS BEING CURRENTLY PAID -- BY INDUSTRY AND I BELIEVE THAT -- HAVING THAT CONVERSATION -- COME OUT AND SHOW THAT WE ARE IN FACT PAYING ENOUGH I STAND AGAINST A STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE IN OPPOSITION. HEY SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MANY MANY MEMBERS. OKAY WITH THAT MISSILE MOMENT TO LIKE TO CLOSE.

THIS IS REALLY ABOUT PROTECTING TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND MAKING SURE THEY DON'T PICK UP THE COST OF THESE ABANDONED WELLS. OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE FOUR TWO AND I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB THREE FOUR TWO WILL HELP CALIFORNIA PROTECT. FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND AND NATIONAL MONUMENTS WITHIN OUR STATE BY PROHIBITING ANY STATE ENTITY WITH POLICING AUTHORITY OVER STATE LANDS FROM ENTERING INTO ANY LEASE AUTHORIZING THE CONSTRUCTION OF OIL AND GAS RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. ON STATE LANDS TO SUPPORT OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ON FEDERALLY PROTECTED LANCE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PURSUING AGGRESSIVE ENERGY POLICY TO OPEN UP MORE MORE FEDERAL LAND TO OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AB THREE FOUR TWO WILL HELP PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDS BY PROHIBITING THE ISSUANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT SUCH OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY BRIAN WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WILL BE TESTIFYING SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS A COMMITTEE. MEMBER I KNOW WE GIVE THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC LANDS FROM OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING TO OPEN MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LAND AND MINERALS STATE ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA TO OIL DRILLING AND FRACKING ENDING THE FEDERAL MORATORIUM ON LEASING CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS TO OIL COMPANIES. THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT UP 290% OF NEW WELLS ON FEDERAL LANDS ARE CRACKED. WHICH OCCURS LARGELY AT SHALLOW DEPTHS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO UNDERGROUND DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF CHEMICALS DANGEROUS TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER NEW DRILLING AND FRACKING WOULD DO FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE AIR QUALITY OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR BASIN WHICH HAS SOME OF THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN THE NATION. OIL AND GAS DRILLING AND FRACKING OPERATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS POLLUTION WHICH CAN TRIGGER ASTHMA WORSE AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS AND ARE LINKED WITH HEART DISEASE AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES. LIKE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET THE PLANET HAS A FOSSIL FUEL BUDGET AND THERE IS ENOUGH OIL GAS AND COAL AND ALREADY OPENED PRODUCING FIELDS GLOBALLY TO TAKE US FAR BEYOND THE PARIS CLIMATE TARGETS. IT DEFIES REASON THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE SELLING OFF PUBLICLY OWNED LANDS AND FOSSIL FUELS FOR DEVELOPMENT NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST KEEP FOSSIL FUELS IN THE GROUND. THE TRUMP PLAN WOULD PUT THE STATE'S MOST ICONIC LANDSCAPES AT RISK AS WELL. IT THREATENS NOT ONLY LANCE MANAGED BY THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT BUT RISKS POLLUTING THE AIR AND WATER OF OTHER FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LANDS IN THE REGION INCLUDING THE ICONIC SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST. LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST GREASE A PLANE NATIONAL MONUMENT AND CALIFORNIA'S BEAUTIFUL COASTLINES. WHILE THE STATE MAY HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY TO STOP THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLAN. TO OPEN OUR PUBLIC LANDS TO EXPANDED FOSSIL FUEL DRILLING. THE STATE SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE WORKING TO FACILITATE THEIR EXPANSION FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB. THREE FOUR TWO AND RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. OR ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THIS BUT THIS IS SIMILAR. TO WHAT -- YET LESS LATE YESTERDAY ON OFFER AFTER. IT IF WE'RE GONNA BLOCKING FROM GOING. THROUGH STATE LANDS ARE GONNA GO AROUND THEM WELL -- THAT. MAY BE AN OPTION THAT -- OIL COMPANIES MAY CHOOSE. TO PURSUE BUT THE THE THE THE BASIC OBJECTIVE IS. TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE -- TO DRILL AND SOME OF OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL -- LANCE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALRIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THE GO AROUND. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO YOU DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WE WERE ROLL CALL. ITEM FOR AB THREE FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MOUNT FUJI THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN YES FRIEDMAN I FLORA. FLORA NOTE CHAU. EGGMAN.

TWO EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS A TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO BE CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THE TAIL PIPE OF CARS TRUCKS OFF ROAD TRANSPORTATION SOURCES AND MORE ACCOUNT FOR ALMOST 40% OF THE GHG INVENTORY IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A 2% INCREASE FROM. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO INCORPORATE CURRENT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS SUCH AS SB THIRTY TWO AND THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY PLANS INTO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THIS UPDATE TO CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION PLANNING WILL IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAMS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH COLLEGE FOR CLEAN AIR. THE HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS OF HELP LET ME -- TAILPIPE EMISSIONS ARE IRREFUTABLE. WE ARE HEATING UP OUR CLIMATE MAKING PEOPLE SICK. TRANSPORTATION SOURCES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80% OF SMOG FORMING KNOCKS EMISSIONS 90% OF DIESEL PM AT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF OUR GREENHOUSE GASES. THESE POLLUTANTS FILE THE AIR WE BREATHE AND CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDE RANGE OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. CARBON POLLUTION FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM DRIVES CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED CONDITIONS. SUCH AS EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES YET THERE'S A SERIOUS DISCONNECT WITH OUR AIR QUALITY IN CLIMB A GOLD AND ARE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. THE RECENT SB ONE FIFTY REPORT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR WE ARE ON THE ROAD TO FAILURE IN MEETING OUR FUTURE GHG REDUCTIONS. AND CLIMATE MANDATES. UNLESS WE SOLVE THE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING PLANNING CONUNDRUM THAT WE FACE. COLLEGE CLEAN AIR SPORTS AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T SURE THAT THE CURRENT CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE STANDARDS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN. THERE'S CRITICAL NEED TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND INVESTMENT SUPPORT REDUCTIONS IN THE POLLUTANTS THAT THREATEN THE HEALTH OF TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE WOULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEETING THIS NEED AND COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. ASKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. HI GOOD EVENING WILL BEAR AT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE TO UPDATES THE ESCAPEES -- CONTENTS THE BILL INSURERS THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION PLAN ACCOUNTS FOR TREATMENT OF OUR FEDERAL CLEAN AIR STANDARDS IN OUR STATE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES. WILL ALSO IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CRITICAL GRANT PROGRAM ALIGNMENT. IN PORTLAND AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE CREATE SPACE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS WITHIN THE PLAN. RECOGNITION THAT MANY CAN COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS AND ASSOCIATED POLLUTION BURDENS TRAFFIC POLLUTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH CAUSING ASTHMA TEXAN CHILDREN. IN A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER HEALTH IMPACTS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT CALIFORNIANS. GIVEN THE URGENCY OF ACHIEVING OUR HEALTH PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY CLIMATE STANDARDS IN A TIME WHEN TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE INCREASING IN OUR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS ARE NOT WELL ALIGNED WITH OUR HEALTH EQUITY IN CLIMATE GOALS. AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE PROVIDES A POSITIVE STEP FORWARD PLANNING. TOWARDS PLANNING ASSISTANT WILL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. YES VICTORIA ROOM WITH AN RTC IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW WITH YOU AT THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE IN OPPOSITION.

HOLD MY POWDER TILL THE NEXT. ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE. PERFECT MANAGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM TWO AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN I FLORA NO FLORA NO CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE GARCIA. GARCIA I LIMóN. LIMON AYE MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NO WAY OUT. MURATSUCHI AYE STONE. STONE AYE. SEVEN THREE ALL RIGHT OKAY I'M SURE THE GO ONE MORE A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YES I THANK YOU MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AS WE KNOW WE'VE HAD HORRIBLE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE WILL MOVE THE BILL. OKAY I'M AT Là JUST FOR THE RECORD SAY THAT -- THIS IS REALLY TO BEEF UP THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS -- WHOLE -- HOMES OF REQUIRING THE NEW IS BUILDING CENTERS ARE OFTEN IGNITION RESISTANT BUT ONLY IF THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. AND WHAT'S NEW ABOUT THOSE FIRES WITH A LOT OF THE HOUSES THAT BURNED WERE NEWER HOUSES THAT DID HAVE A LOT OF THE MORE RESILIENT A FIRE CODES BUILT INTO THEM BUT WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT THE VEGETATION THAT WAS RIGHT WITHIN THE FIVE FOOT. THIS FIVE FOOT BUFFER WAS WHAT IGNITED THE HOUSES AND THAT WAS NOT IN THE CURRENT -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS SO THIS NARROWS IT DOWN TO REALLY TRY TO GUIDE PEOPLE TO LOOKING AT THE SPACE BETWEEN ZERO AND FIVE FEET OF YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE EVEN IF YOUR YARD DOESN'T BURN YOUR TREE DECEMBER AND IF IT AMBER BLOWS INTO A BUSH SITS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR WINDOW. THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO BLOW THE WINDOW OUT AND ALLOW FIRE TO MOVE INTO A HOME SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CAL FIRE. WITH THE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU KNOW THESE ARE OURS ARE MEASURES THAT -- A LOT OF THE EXPERTS BELIEVE ARE REALLY NECESSARY TO START INSTITUTING TO MAKE OUR HOMES MORE FIRE RESILIENT. WITH ME TODAY TO SUPPORT IN IT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LIZ FOR FOSS BURKE FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND RICK SAID TOLD ME A FARCE ADVISER FROM UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING GREAT. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCE BURKE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA'S OF THE WORST WILDFIRES IN HISTORY SETTING NEW RECORDS FOR THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY US. IN THE FACE OF MAKE THE FIRES WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO INVEST IN AND CREATE FIRE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. BUT IF YOU'RE CONSERVANCY IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE FIRE ADOPTED COMMUNITIES LEARNING NETWORK A NATIONAL GROUP WORKING TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE CAPACITY IN FIRE PRONE COMMUNITIES. THE COALITION IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PEOPLE IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE ADAPTOR LIVING WITH WILD FIRE. AND REDUCE THEIR RISK FOR DAMAGE. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STOP MOTION HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WE MUST MAKE THE MORE RESILIENT TO FIRE SAFE BUILDING STANDARDS DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAMS. EVACUATION PLANNING AND PREVENTION OF HUMAN CAUSED IGNITIONS AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MAKES IMPORTANT CHANGES TO IMPROVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE ENSURING WE ARE ADOPTING CALIFORNIA TO DEAL WITH THE ESCALATING FOR A FIRE. WE ALSO BE MORE RESOURCES AN EXPERT TO COULD HELP WITH FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AB FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IMPROVE THE TRAINING OF LOCAL DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS AND PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR CONSERVATION CORES. RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS AND FIRE CITY COUNCIL TO CONDUCT DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR HOMEOWNERS. LET'S STOP MAKING HISTORY AND START MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES MORE FIRE RESILIENT THROUGH IMPORTANT MEASURES LIKE AB. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS RICK IS TELL ME I AM FORCE VISOR OF PC DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES BASED ON A SHASTA TRINITY AND SISKIYOU COUNTY. YOU SEE SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A NON COMBUSTIBLE ZONE AROUND STRUCTURES IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD. DANGER AREAS. OUR RESEARCH AND MY OWN EXPERIENCE DURING THE CAR FIRE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE THREE TO FIVE FOOT ZONE IS A CRITICAL AREA TO PROTECT -- WENT WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE HUMMING MISSION POTENTIAL. BY ADDRESSING THIS CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN OUR HOME OUR KERN FIRE DEFENSE STRATEGY WE WILL REINFORCE OUR EFFORTS. OF OUR AGENCY COLLEAGUES WHEN THEY GO ABOUT PROTECTING HOME STRING WILDFIRE. AT THIS POINT IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU SEE AN ARTS ONGOING EFFORTS SURROUNDING -- NEAR HOME FIRE DEFENSE OR OUR CURRENT RESEARCH. I AM HAPPY TO HELP. ANSWER I CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. KRISTIN MURPHY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. BRIAN -- ACUTE THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN SUPPORT. SYLVIA SO LEASE SHAUN BEHALF OF ALL STATE INSURANCE AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT CNN ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEE AN NINE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THE CARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AT DEJA VU I I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WEATHER IS THAT AT INFORMATIONAL HEARING OR WHEN YOU'RE HIGHER BILLS ARE ARE ALL THE ABOUT. A SOON. THE BILL THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT BEFORE I RECALL AT THIS MAKES SENSE IS JUST WONDERING. WHO WOULD BE AGAINST THIS AND WHAT WHAT WITH THE PUSH BACK IF ANY? IF ANY BE AGAINST THIS WOULD IT BE I GUESS I PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD LIKE IT BUT THERE ARE OTHER ANY ORGANIZED GROUP SERVING ORGANIZATIONS WOULD OBJECT TO THIS. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY ORGANIZED OPPOSITION BUT THIS THIS BILL IS REALLY INTENDED TO ALSO WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE DANGERS OF HAVING -- THIS COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS AROUND THEIR HOMES AND CERTAINLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO HAS YOU KNOW ONE SMALL PLANNED AND THEN. I'VE BEEN JUST DOING WINDSHIELD SURVEYS AND DRIVING AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSES THAT ARE LITERALLY WRAPPED. IN FOLIAGE -- YOU KNOW IS A IS REALLY ASTOUNDING AND WHEN I TALK TO HOMEOWNERS AND YOU KNOW I I PUT MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT THE DANGERS THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT TO HAVE A PLANT TEN FEET AWAY FOR YOUR HOUSE IS TO HAVE ONE THAT'S LITERALLY. RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR YOUR HOUSE SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE COMMUNITIES USE THIS TO TO GO OUT AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. AND START TO SORT OF IDENTIFY THOSE HOMES ARE MOST AT RISK AND SEND THEM NOTICES THE WAY THEY DO WITH OTHER TYPES OF HAZARD AND BRUSH CLEARANCE ISN'T AND GET THE WORD OUT. THIS ONE IS. THANK YOU OKAY SO NIGHT TWO QUESTIONS -- ONE IS. I I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT THERE IS ALREADY -- A PENALTY ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HAVING THIS DEFENSIBLE SPACE YOU'RE SAYING -- IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE. YOUR SHORTENING. THEAMOUNT OF SPACE IN BETWEEN THE HOME AND AND FOLIAGE CORRECT WELL THERE'S TWO DIFFERENCES THE FIRST IS THAT THERE IS NO THE CURRENTLY IS ZERO TO FIVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ZONE. SO THIS DOES CREATE A NEWS ON BASED ON WHAT WE SAW IN THE LAST COUPLE OF FIRES AND SECONDLY RIGHT NOW THERE'S A CIVIL PENALTY AND LEAN AUTHORITY BUT HELL FIRES NEVER USED IT HOWEVER. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT SO THIS CREATES AN ADMINISTRATIVE -- REMEDY FOR THEM BUT AGAIN WITH THE GOAL TOWARDS GETTING COMPLIANCE -- YOU KNOW NOT TO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THE MINISTRY OF ROMANI AND I UNDERSTAND. ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY THROUGH AN ALLERGY PROCESS. RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTY WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO DO IT THEY'RE STILL A PROCESS AND THEY'RE STILL AWAY FOR THE HOMEOWNER TO RESPOND BUT IT'S THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE COURT SYSTEM TO DO IT. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY'VE HAD THIS ABILITY TO PLACE A LIEN ON THE HOME THEY HAVE THAT NOW. THEY JUST NEVER USE IT AND SO YOUR OBJECTIVE LEAST PARTIALLY IN THIS BILL IS TO MAKE IT EASIER. TO HAVE A LIEN PLACED ON HOMEOWNERS PROPERTY IT'S NOT FOR A LEAN IT'S FOR THE FINE. CORRECT. YEAH AND IT'S FOR THE FINES AND TO GET COMPLIANCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE OKAY IN -- SO WHEN YOU WERE TALKING MUCH DRIVING TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD NOTICING A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANTS AROUND THEIR HOMES -- I'M JUST HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE PEOPLE GOING TO KNOW THAT THEIR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WELL THEY WOULD BE NOTIFIED THE SAME WAY THAT RIGHT NOW I I I I'LL JUST USE MY OWN EXPERIENCE. EVERY YEAR THE CITY OF GLENDALE DOES HAVE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DO THEY DRIVE AROUND THE HIGH FIRED JONES THEY START SENDING OUT NOTICES PEOPLE SAYING. YOU KNOW FROM WHAT WE SAW YOUR OUT OF COMPLIANCE YOU'RE NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW PERSONALLY BUT YOU'RE A YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT YOU NEED TO REMOVE SOME OF THE BRUSH IN YOUR LANDSCAPE. AND SO THEY DO ACTUALLY NOTIFY PEOPLE. AND CAL FIRE DOES NOTIFY PEOPLE IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES OWN SO THERE IS NOTICING THAT GOES OUT. OKAY SO THEN -- EVERYONE IS A GUARANTEED BEING NOTIFIED IF THEY'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE BUT WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY THE SITUATION BEFORE THEY GET FINED ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT IS THAT TIME FRAME. LET'S NOT I GUESS IT'S WHATEVER IT IS NOW RATED YOU'RE NOT CHANGING THAT IT MIGHT CHANGE BY DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITY OR WHO'S THE RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES SO CAL FIRE FOR THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THEY DO THAT IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ON A LOT OF MUNICIPALITIES. DO IT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE HAVE THEIR OWN YOU KNOW THEIR OWN A PROCESS. OKAY -- THANK YOU. WELCOME. YES THIS MATHIS SO. WE WE YOU SAY YOU GET A NOTIFICATION. I ON A HOUSE YOU'VE HAD FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU SPENT. A TON OF INVESTMENT. NOT ON THIS LANDSCAPE NET NAGGING NOTIFICATION THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF IT SEOUL. WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL RECUPERATION FOR HAVING TO REMOVE THAT? BE BECAUSE NOW NOW WE'RE WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE THAT I'VE HAD THIS LANDSCAPE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG HEY GUESS WHAT YOU NEED PULL ALL THAT OUT. SO WE WITHOUT. THE ANY ABILITY TO PULL NOW SO NOW WE'RE JUST EXPECTING PEOPLE TO GO READ ABOUT SOMETHING AND INVESTMENT THAT THEY'VE MADE. THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOLD FOR DECADES IS IS AN INVESTMENT TO INCREASE OUR HOME VALUE. AND SO. I MEAN IS THERE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE IN YOUR BILL THAT'S GOING TO HELP PAY FOR THIS. ORDER IF IT'S AN OLD TREE THAT'S BEEN THERE. I MEAN TO SOMETIMES TAKE A SOME OF THE STUFF OUT IS EXTREMELY COSTLY ESPECIALLY IF IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOUSE. THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ROOT SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING. UNDERNEATH THE FOUNDATION -- SO I MEAN IT IT THESE THIS CAN GIVE VERY VERY COSTLY VERY QUICKLY -- A ADDED RE CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELING HOMES AND FLIPPING HOUSES AND BETWEEN DEPLOYMENTS. IN. I MEAN FIXING A FOUNDATION IS A NIGHTMARE. SO IF YOU'RE GONNA GO START PULLING STUFF OUT. I MEAN IS THIS CAN QUICKLY GOING TO THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO DO. OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL -- WE ARE NOT -- IT RIGHT NOW SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITHIN THE FIVE FEET WE THE BILL DIRECTS -- THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW EXPERTS SORT OF COTTON SORT OF WELL I'M A LOOK AT WHAT EXACTLY WE SHOULD BE RECOMMENDING BUT ALSO TO FOCUS ON SORT OF THE MOST FLAMMABLE MOST DANGEROUS MATERIALS. BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IS EXPENSIVE IS REMOVING THIS MATERIAL WITHIN FIVE FEET FOR YOUR HOUSES IT'S NOT GONNA BE NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS REPLACING YOUR HOUSE IF IT BURNS DOWN IN A FIRE. SO THERE IS A YOU KNOW KIND OF A RISK ANALYSIS THAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO BE DOING WHEN THEY LOOK AT THIS AND IF YOU. GET A NOTICE FROM ONE OF YOUR AGENCY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A REAL A HAZARDOUS CONDITION AND YOU'RE ALREADY LIVING AT A HIGH FIRE. SEVERITY ZONE WHICH THIS BILL ONLY IMPACTS. YOU REALLY NEED TO DO THAT COST BENEFIT US AND BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO GETS NOTICE WAS A COUPLE OF PLANTS IS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU'VE GOT. A REALLY FLAMMABLE TREE RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR HOUSE. PEOPLE REALLY DO NEED TO BE PUT ON NOTICE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE HOW HAZARDOUS THAT IS THEY JUST DON'T NOW SO A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN NO AYE THOSE KINDS OF ANALYSIS YOU TO DO THAT DO THAT ANALYSIS AND SELF. ABSOLUTELY BUT THE MEN WERE ALSO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WERE YOU KNOW. SAYING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEIR OWN TRAFFIC TICKETS. SO HOW SHOULD WE EXPECT THEM TO REMOVE TREES THERE ARE -- FIRE -- RESPONSIBILITY -- AREAS THAT HAVE COME UP WITH WAYS OF INCENTIVIZING AND FINANCING LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS TO REMOVE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE ARE CITIES THAT DO THAT AS WELL WHERE THEY HAVE FOR LOW INCOMES -- HOMEOWNERS AND SENIORS -- ALL KINDS OF HAZARD ABATEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO THERE ARE LOCAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN MANY PLACES AND I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT. MEASURES TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DO ALL KINDS OF HOME HARDENING -- BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ALL ACROSS THE STATE AS WILD FIRE RISK INCREASES I MEAN WILL HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION ABOUT HOME HARDENING ABOUT REPLACING ROOFS ABOUT. YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT MEASURES YOU KNOW I THINK IS AS HIGHLIGHTED. ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND DEFENSE YEAH SPACE EIGHT MY FIRST JOB WAS DRIVING A THREE WHEELER WITH THE TRAILER CLEARING DEFENSIBLE SPACE ON THE COUNTRY -- IN IN MY ROLE COMMUNITY WHERE I GREW UP SO I I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT VERY WELL -- BUT I ALSO ONE OF THE BY I ALSO KNOWS VERY COSTLY IN WITHOUT HAVING A FUNDING. TASKED WITH IN THE BILL TO REALLY HAVE A MECHANISM THERE. TO HELP THESE FAMILIES OUT TO DO THIS I I CAN'T SUPPORT IT INTO A SALE ALSO SAID THAT A BIG PART OF THIS IS TO CHANGE THE CODES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION A NEW LANDSCAPES THAT ARE PUT IN AND YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE IGNORED BECAUSE LANDSCAPE DESIGNERS. ARE STILL DESIGNING NEW NEW LANDSCAPES TODAY IN THESE ZONES WITH PLANTING RIGHT IN THAT FIVE FOOT -- AREA. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. FROM A FIREFIGHTER -- SORRY MR SOME GOOD WE JUST ADD IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED PRETTY CLOSELY WITH MILES WHO WAS OR THE SECOND I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT'S GOING TO GET USE. EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS THE HOUSE. LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES NO THE HOUSE. THAT FIRE SAFE COUNCILS NO THE HOUSE THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET CLEANED UP AND THAT ONE HOUSE WHO REFUSES TO CLEAN UP. AND ADDRESS OF THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IS A THREAT TO THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD SO YEAH IT'S A COST TO THAT HOUSE BUT IT'S A COST TO THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IN THESE FIRE. RISK AREAS WHEN THEY GO UP SO I DON'T SEE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE CAL FIRE. USING THIS IRRESPONSIBLY THEY'RE GOING TO THEY CONSTANTLY ARE WORKING WITH HOMEOWNERS THEIR COSTLY WORKING WITH NEIGHBORHOODS TO GET THEM TO CLEAN UP THE RISKIEST AREAS AND THOSE LAST FEW HOMES THAT REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE. AND THAT PUT ITS THREAT THE REST OF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE. THIS TOOL WILL BE USED. TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE THAT'S THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T SEE IT BEING USED. SORT OF **** NILLY AND JUST FOR FOR EVERYONE AND IT'S ASTONISHING WHAT SOME HOMEOWNERS ARE ARE REALLY NOT WILLING TO DO THAT BUT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AT RISK AND THIS IS HOW THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. CNN MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AT THE END OF THE HEARING. THIS.
