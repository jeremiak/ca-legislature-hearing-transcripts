CERTAINLY- HERE LIVE IN PERSON WE ALSO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY LATER ON THE HEARING THE ACCESS PUBLIC COMMON NUMBERS ON THE AGENDA AND I'LL REPEAT THAT LATER IN THE HEARING- SO TODAY OF COURSE IS FOCUSING ON PRIMARILY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. ARE ARE- TODAY. IN IN CALIFORNIA HERE- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY PROUD OF CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS- ECONOMIC BASE BUT ALSO UPWARD MOBILITY. AND- FOUND WE HAD A BIG DEBATE YESTERDAY ON UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY EMISSIONS AND DECISION ON THE COURT CASE AND SEE WHAT UPDATES AND SO THIS GETS TO THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS ACCESS TO THE COVETED- UC SYSTEM AND THAT'S ALWAYS A CERTAINLY A TOP TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS OVERALL PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR MISSION. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR YOU SEE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ON THEIR BUDGET AND AGAIN FOCUS ON OUR TOP PRIORITY ENROLLMENT. A LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE UC- YOU KNOW SOME- BOOSTERS AND HIGHER AND YOU SEEN OTHERS CALL THE YOU KNOW THE BEST BUDGET EVER. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY COMING AFTER COATED WITH THAT YEARS OF CUTS AND PREDICTABILITY AS FAR AS WE WERE HEADED- BUT WE DID HAVE. A RECORD AMOUNT OF MONIES IN THE BASE FUNDING IN ONE TIME MONEY TO SUPPORT THE UC PLUS. MASSIVE ENROLLMENT INVESTMENT WHICH WILL GET TO. THAT'S WHY THIS IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE IS A BIT OF DISAPPOINTMENT LEGISLATURE THAT. THAT YOU SEE IS NOT- ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH SO FAR ON THE AGREEMENT WE MADE LAST YEAR. TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY SEVEN THOUSAND ROUGHLY NEW STUDENTS AT WINNER STAND THAT YOU SEE OVER AND ROLLED- STUDENTS- TWO YEARS AGO AND IT TOOK ROUGHLY TWO YEARS TO COUNT HOW MANY THEY ACTUALLY HAD THAT'S GREAT NEWS. WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT THAT AND I CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT LATER BUT WE DO SUPPORT FULLY FUNDING. EVER STUDENT SHOWS UP BUT YOU SEE LIKE WE DO AT OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM I THINK THERE IS THIS. PROBLEM WE'VE HAD AFTER THE RECESSION WE'RE- YOU KNOW IN K. TWELVE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU FIND HIS THEIR WHO SHOWS UP AND THEN YOU SEE WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS. HAD IT LIKE THAT FOR UC AND CSU SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FIXING THAT ISSUE. SO WE CAN HAVE A TRUE UP AFTER THE YEAR TO MAKE SURE WE FIND ACTUAL. ENROLLMENT AT THE UC. BUT AGAIN IT IS- DISAPPOINTING THAT- THE SPEAKER THE PRO TAB OF THE BUDGET SHARE. AND THE SENATE ASSEMBLY WE ALL HIGHLIGHTED THE SEVEN THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS ARE GONNA START THIS FALL. AND NOW THAT IS IN QUESTION SO WE WANT TO GET TO THE CRUX. AT AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD- WE DID FIND THOSE- SLOTS IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE HAVE TO SORT OUT- AGAIN ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AS A TOP TOP PRIORITY AND- WE HOPE TO- FIND AT. A PATH THAT WE CAN ALL. BE PROUD OF HERE TODAY- SO WITH THAT. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND ISSUE NUMBER ONE ENROLLMENT. WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ALEJO. AND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IN THAT ORDER THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- JAX WEALTH BERMAN OF FINANCE- THE COMPACT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE ADMINISTRATION- SETS CLEAR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING THAT GROWTH. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT INCREASED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT MOMENT BY BOTH INCREASING. CAPACITY AND BY FUNDING THE FIRST YEAR MULTI A PLAN TO REPLACE NONRESIDENT STUDENTS- WITH RESIDENTS STUDENTS AT THREE CAMPUSES- IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN WOULD GROW RESIDENT MOMENT BY ABOUT 1% ANNUALLY BEGINNING AND- TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- EVERYONE MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIANS BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX. TWENTY SEVEN. AND INCREASING GRADUATE STUDENT ROLE THAT BY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DURING THE SAME PERIOD THANKS. IF YOU CAN GO. YOUR FROZEN. PLEASE LET TO MIMIC SOME. OKAY THANK YOU SORRY ABOUT THAT SOME CONFUSION THERE- L. A. L. DUSAN CONCENTRA ROSELLI- IF YOU WANT HAS TO TOPICS IN IT THE FIRST RELATES TO ENROLLMENT DECISIONS- THAT WERE MADE IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AFFECTING ENROLLMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. SEVEN THE SECOND TOPIC IS AROUND INVOLVEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED FUTURE YEARS SOLVED QUICKLY TOUCH ON EACH TOPIC. ALL ON THE FIRST TOPIC I THINK TERM MCCARTY USED COMMENTS- SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE QUITE WELL BUT TO FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE SITUATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA. THERE IS A SURE TABLE ON KATE I'M SORRY PAGE FIVE OF HER GENDER THERE'S A SHORT TABLE ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA. FIRST ROW THE MOMENT EXPECTATIONS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND GET THE GOVERNOR BUDGET IS INTENDING TO IMPLEMENT DECISIONS ARE MADE OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SO THAT RESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE. STUDENTS WILL REFLECT GROWTH OF SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO STUDENTS OVER THE LEVEL AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SECOND ROW SHOWS UC'S PLANS AND IT'S A BIT LOWER IT SHOWS ENROLLMENT OF JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS MORE THAN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IF HE'S PLANNING TO SPEND THE REMAINING FUNDS ON OVER TARGETED ROMAN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THE QUESTION FOR LEGISLATORS HOW TO RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES AND- WITH A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS HERE. ONE IS TO TREAT UC'S PLANTED ROMAN LEVEL AS THOSE SORT OF BASELINE LEVEL IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS BECAUSE YOU SEE IT IS CURRENTLY MAKING FALL ADMISSION DECISIONS BY THE TIME THE BUDGET IS ENACTED IT WILL HELP ONCE WE FINALIZE THOSE POLITICIAN DECISIONS. I'M ALSO LOOKING LIKELY WILL BE SORT OF THE BASELINE THAT UC'S WORKING OFF OF FOR RESIDENT. MOMENTS IF YOU WERE TO TREAT THAT THEY- AS A AS THE BASIS FOR FUNDING THAT FOURTEEN HUNDRED STUDENT GROWTH ESTIMATE WOULD COME TO ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. YOUR AGENDA STARTS EARLIER ESTIMATE WE PROVIDED IN OUR REGIONAL ANALYSIS OF FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS WORKING OFF SOME. PRELIMINARY DATA THAT YOU SEE PROVIDED THIS THIRTY SEVEN MILLION REFLECTS THE UPDATED INFORMATION. ON THE- NOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ABOVE- THAT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION UP TO THE ENTIRE NINETY NINE MILLION PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR- DOING SO WOULD EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THAT OVER TARGET GROWTH AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS HASN'T PROVIDED FUNDING FOR OVER TARGET GROWTH. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS A UNIQUE SITUATION- THAT WAS A PERIOD OF WHEN THERE IS A PANDEMIC THERE IS A PARTICULARLY LARGE GROWTH AND DEMANDS TO INVOLVE DURING THE SUMMER. THE UNIQUE SITUATION THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE CONSIDER MAKING IT A SUFFIX OPTION FOR THIS YEAR. AND THEN THE SECOND TOPIC AND ROMAN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- THREE HUNDRED NOTES THE LEGISLATURE RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN SETTING TARGETS FOR BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE. THAT APPROACH IS INTENDED TO BETTER SIGNAL LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS FOR. THE UPCOMING YEAR GIVEN THAT POLITICIAN DECISIONS ARE USUALLY MADE UP BEFORE THE BUDGET IS ENACTED IN JUNE. I WOULD RECOMMEND- TAKING THIS APPROACH- ONE OF PRACTICE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER DOING IS SETTING UP- A- LEVEL TARGET RATHER THAN GROWTH TARGET STONE SERVE SPECIFYING GROWTH OF SAY FIVE HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND OVER HOW MANYHOW MUCH GROWTH THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS. IT ACTUALLY I SENT THE BUDGET THE SPECIFIC LEVEL SO IT MIGHT BE TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND OR TWO HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND RIGHT WHATEVER THE LEVEL THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS. BIGELOW TARGET WITH BETTER. LEGISLATIVE EXPECTING AROUND. AND HELP AVOID SOME OF THE SITUATION LEGISLATURE SPACE IN THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE NOW HEAR FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR GOOD MORNING CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND SAY OVER TEN AND REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HOPEFULLY MY AUDIO IS COMING THROUGH WELL IT WAS FREEZING EARLIER SO- THANK YOU. SHOULD DO IF YOU CAN HEAR ME- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S THANKFUL THE GOVERNOR YOU SOME FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET INTRODUCTION AND WE ARE REQUESTING THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED NEW FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO GROWING ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WE RECOGNIZE THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ARE CONNECTED AT THAT ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL GIVE OUR FUTURE STUDENTS THE CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ENROLLS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AN INCREASE OF OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED F. TO YOU FROM A DECADE AGO. AND AN INCREASE OF OVER NINE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AT TWENTY THIRTY THERE USED TO BE JUST SOME PRESIDENT DRAKE ONE TO INCREASE THE UNIVERSITY'S ENROLLMENT BY TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. INCLUDED AND THIS PROPOSED GROWTH ARE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AND FOUR THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS INCLUDE THE REPLACEMENT OF FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NONRESIDENT STUDENTS WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES SIXTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ONGOING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE INVOLVEMENT. BY SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. THE UNIVERSITY APPRECIATES THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN OUR STUDENTS AND WE REQUEST YOU SUPPORT THESE FUNDS. WE DO HAVE A REQUEST ON HOW THE PROPOSED ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS WOULD BE MEASURED. THE LAST TIME THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY WITH ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDS WAS IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN AT THAT TIME YOU FUNDED FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY STUDENTS. OVER TWO YEARS AT OUR CAMPUSES. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING YOU PROVIDED THAT ALLOWED THE CAMPUS IS TO HIRE INSTRUCTORS. IN A TIMELY WAY. UNIVERSITY THIS TARGET UP THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY STUDENTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACADEMIC CYCLE. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT YOU FUND ALL THE STUDENTS ABOVE THE FUNDED ENROLLMENT TARGET SET IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN WITH THE BOOK MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION. ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO COUNT THIS PRIOR YEAR ENROLLMENT TOWARDS THE GOAL OF SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NEW STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY WANTS TO PROVIDE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WITH EQUAL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND FUNDING THE STUDENTS WILL ALLOW US TO HIRE THE FACULTY TO TEACH THE COURSES. AND THE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE ACADEMIC SERVICES THAT THE STUDENTS. SERVICE THE GREAT RECESSION THE UNIVERSITY HAS SEEN A STEADY EROSION AND THE STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO OF STUDENTS SATISFACTION WITH THE UC EDUCATION. WELL THE 200063% OF UNDERGRADUATES REPORTED NOT. GET THE MAJOR OF. THIS IN TWENTY TWENTY THIS NUMBER HAD GROWN EROSION OF QUALITY AND ITS IMPACT ON RETENTION RATE TO STUDENTS IS LARGELY DUE TO OVER TARGET ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS. AND THE DECREASING DOLLARS PER STUDENT RECEIVED BY THE CAMPUS SINCE. YOUR KIDS ARE ROLLED ABOVE THE TARGET ENROLLMENT SAID IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WOULD MEAN THAT WITH THE FUNDS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE CAMPUS IS COULDN'T ROLL AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY IS AWARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO DO UNIVERSITY EVEN FURTHER. WITH THAT ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE MILLION ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE UNIVERSITY COULDN'T ROLL AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. FOR A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IN ADDITION TO THIS ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES THIRTY ONE MILLION ON GOING FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO REPLACE. NINE HUNDRED AND TO NONRESIDENT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. FOR PAUL TWENTY TEN THROUGH- THE UC BERKELEY UCLA AND UC SAN DIEGO CAMPUS AS- THE CAMPUSES ARE PREPARING TO PROVIDE ADMISSIONS OFFERS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO INVOLVEMENT. AND ALL THREE CAMPUSES INTEND TO REPLACE THREE HUNDRED NONRESIDENT STUDENTS. WITH CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES TO REACH THIS NINE HUNDRED AND TWO STUDENT REPLACEMENT GOAL. RECEIVING THE FUNDING FOR THE NON RESIDENT REPLACEMENT IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE CAMPUSES RELY ON THESE FUNDS FOR MANY ASPECTS OF THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS FROM HIRING FACULTY TO TEACH MORE COURSES TO STUDENTS SERVICES TO MAINTAINING THE CAMPUS FACILITIES. CURRENTLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED OVER 12% OF CAMPUS CORE FUNDS FROM NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID BY NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. THEN THERE WERE THE ROLE MY GROWTH AND NON RESIDENT REPLACEMENT PLAN MEANS THAT WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING PROVIDED AND IN ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE MILLION I MENTIONED EARLIER. UC CAMPUSES COULD ADD UP TO TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES WE'RE TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE. FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNIVERSITY RECEIVED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF UNDERGRADUATE APPLICATIONS IN OUR HISTORY AND ADMITTED OUR MOST DIVERSE FRESHMAN CLASS EVER. THE UNIVERSITY ALSO ENROLLED MORE LACK NEXT STUDENTS IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAN EVER BEFORE AND MORE AFRICAN AMERICAN GRADUATE STUDENTS THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS YEAR. TO CONTINUE ON THE SUCCESS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY IN FUTURE YEARS WHAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE 5% ANNUAL BASE BUDGET INCREASES WE WILL DISCUSS IN THE NEXT ITEM. SUPPORT FOR THIS AT DIGITAL INVOLVEMENT IS VITAL TO PROVIDING INCREASED ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO FOR FUTURE UC STUDENTS. THE 1% GROWTH WOULD TRANSLATE TO ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES ANNUALLY. ENDED ANNUAL STATE SUPPORT COST OF ROUGHLY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION AS ENROLLMENT GROWS. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S MULTI YEAR BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES ENROLLMENT OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN WITH THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE PROPOSED 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE. SOME OF THE PROPOSED NEW INVOLVEMENT WILL BE ACCOMMODATED THROUGH INCREASED ONLINE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BY INCREASING GRADUATION RATES TO ALLOW FOR THEIR THROUGHPUT OF STUDENT. AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF SUMMER SESSIONS. IN CLOSING WE REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THE FUNDING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR YOU SEE INVOLVEMENT BUT CHANGE THE MEASUREMENT FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH TO BE FROM THE FUNDED LEVEL OF THE BUDGET ACT OF. TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I'LL HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BUT TURNED OVER TO MR MR MEDINA. YOU WANNA GO. YOU SEE TO MENTION- THE BILL THAT I HI AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY- HAVE INTRODUCED TO INCREASE OF FUNDING AT THE UC ARE AND UC MERCED CAMPUS- AS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT MANY TIMES HERE OF BOTH UC RIVERSIDE- ESPECIALLY UC RIVERSIDE HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDER FUNDED AND- PER STUDENT OF FUNDING SO THE BILL THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND I OR INTRODUCING IS TO TRY TO ATTEMPT. TO- FIX THAT THAT CONDITION AND TO BRING BOTH OF THOSE TWO CAMPUSES UP TO THE SAME KIND OF LEVEL OF FUNDING. AS THE OTHER- AS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO FLAGSHIP CAMPUSES SO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- GRAY AND I INTRODUCED A BILL TO- FIND YOU SEE OUR- AND UC MERCED WITH CLOSE TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME MONEY. AND I'M GONG I'M GOING MONEY AS WELL- WE HAD THE CHANCELLOR'S OF BOTH YOU SEE OUR AND UC MERCED HERE YESTERDAY- I THINK IT'S- PAST TIME THAT ALL CAMPUSES BE- TREATED EQUALLY AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT AND YOU SEE. HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR MANY YEARS- UNDER THE PAST TWO PRESIDENTS- WITH THREE BENCHING BUT I THINK MY BILL AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGREES BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY. PROVIDE EQUAL TREATMENT TO ALL CAMPUSES AND ESPECIALLY AS YOU POINTED OUT TO THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST A MINORITY- ENROLLMENT- BEING UC RIVERSIDE AND UC MERCED TO JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON YOUR RADAR- AND PERHAPS ASK FOR A COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR CAMPUSES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR STUDENTS AND THE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD SLIGHTLY LESS FUNDING PER STUDENT THAT OTHER CAMPUSES AS YOU MENTIONED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TRYING TO CORRECT FOR THE INEQUITIES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. FIRST BY IMPLEMENTING BREED BENCHING WHICH SOUGHT TO GIVE EACH CAMPUS- THE SAME DOLLARS PER STUDENT. IN ORDER TO CREATE SOME- SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE FUNDING LEVELS OF OUR CAMPUSES AND WE ARE NOW ARE PRETTY FINDING THAT FORMULA TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT- WITHIN THE DOLLARS PER STUDENT BECAUSE WE PREVIOUSLY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF STUDENTS. WITHIN DOLLARS PER STUDENT THAT NO CAMPUS AS MORE THAN 5% OF HELLO OTHER CAMPUSES AND WHAT THEY RECEIVE OUR STUDENTS. WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU- ON ON MY BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MR MEDINA. THAT'S A NICE- SEGUE TO THE ENVIRONMENT ISSUE BECAUSE WHILEWHY MR MEDINA'S PROPOSAL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE FOR MORE INVOLVEMENT AT RIVERSIDE AND ALSO UC MERCED. IS THAT SIR WE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM IN CAPACITY TO GROW I WILL NOTE THOSE ARE CITIES WE DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW NIMBY NEIGHBORS FIGHTING IN SUING TO. TO HALTS- EXPANSION THAT THOSE UC CAMPUSES SO THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING VERY PROMISING. JUST WANNA GO BACK- TO THIS DAY AND I'M NOT GONNA YOU KNOW BE DONE THIS ISSUE AT AND YOU KNOW. THAT THERE'S THAT. DISAPPOINTMENT IS TO UNDERSTATE THE REFLECTION THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE SEVEN THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS THIS FALL AND I KNOW YOU SEE SAYING WELLS THIS WEEK. WE HAD FIVE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND WAITING QUITE COUNTS LAST FEW YEARS WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MANY OTHER WHERE SO WE'RE GONNA CANNOT CONTRIBUTE THOSE TO THE NEW AND THEN ONLY DO A COUPLE THOUSAND. THIS YEAR SO WE WANT TO KEEP. ENGAGING IN THE NEXT FW MONTHS. AND IT'S HARD TO TURN ON THE WATER SPEAK IT NOW SO YES SEVEN THOUSAND ARE GOING TO BE THIS FALL FROM THE SLICK LESSON. YOU KNOW A ROUGHLY ABOUT- SIX OR SO MONTHS AWAY SO- BUT- YOU KNOW AT THE MINIMUM THE SEMESTER THIS SEMESTER AFTER THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON- SO THE QUESTION IS HOW. HOW CAN AT THIS POINT. HOW CAN LOOKING YOU SEE. HELLO SECOND. WHAT CAN YOU SEE PUT OUT THERE AS FAR AS BEING MORE IN LINE WITH THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNOR'S EXPECTATIONS LAST SUMMER WE PASS THE BUDGET FOR THIS SEVEN THOUSAND NUMBER I HEARD YOU EARLIER SAY TWELVE HUNDRED PLUS FIVE HUNDRED MORE YOU'D ADD ON FOR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND I THINK LAST WEEK WE'RE TALKING TWENTY FIVE IN THE TO SELL I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS THEIR CELL. MAYBE ADDRESS THAT SIMPLE START WITH THAT FIRST THING. BUT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE- TWELVE HUNDRED PLUS THE FIVE HUNDRED- WAS INTENDED TO- LOOK AT THE NEW STUDENTS WITHOUT THE NON RESIDENT REPLACE TOUCH WITH THE NON RESIDENT PLACEMENT IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS WHILE PREVIOUSLY WE HAD DISCUSSED TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS YEAH. THIS FALL YEAH AND THAT OF COURSE IS VERY YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S GREAT NEWS AND OF COURSE OUR FOCUS A 100% IS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- WE HEARD THIS LOUD AND CLEAR YES YOUR HONOR FLOOR DEBATE ABOUT BERKELEY THAT'S OUR TOP TOP PRIORITY MAKE NO MISTAKE IN PEOPLE HAVE QUALMS OF THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT OUR- CONSTITUENTS- DEMAND OF US- YOU KNOW BUT IT'S REALLY ONLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED NEW SLOTS NEW SPACES BECAUSE NINE HUNDRED WORK RE SHUFFLING FROM YOU KNOW NON RESIDENTS WHO ARE LEAVING THE SYSTEM BRING ANY. SO THIS HUNDRED KIND AND NEWS NEWS SLOTS AND WHY THIS MATTER SO MUCH AS GOES BACK TO YOUR COMMENTS FIVE MINUTES AGO WE HAVE THE LARGEST EVER. QUALIFIED APPLICANT POOL- SO WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE AMAZING GRADES. I'M OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE TEST SCORES AREN'T THERE ANYMORE THE SAT BEING PHASED OUT WE APPROPRIATELY. BUT GPA AND CLASS RANK. AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS ALL MATTER WE HAVE AMAZING APPLICANTS YOU JUST YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE SPACE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA PUSH. AS HARD AS WE CAN. TO APPROPRIATELY GET AS MANY STUDENTS TEN ALONG WITH OTHER HAS BEEN ONLY TO ADDRESS. FACILITIES YOU KNOW CLASSROOM SPACE LAB SPACE AND YOU KNOW THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WITH THE DEBATE WITH BERKELEY IS HOUSING SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY ON THAT WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY ON THAT. SO- THE QUESTION IS. HOW CAN THE UC HELP US ACHIEVE LAST YEAR'S GOAL WHICH IS THE SEVEN THOUSAND NUMBER ABOVE WHICH YOU ARTICULATED EARLIER IN YOUR PRESENTATION HOW CAN WE KIND OF BRIDGE THAT. THE GAP HERE BETWEEN US. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR- BRIDGING THE GAP FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO MAY NOT BE FULLY POSSIBLE. BECAUSE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE ENOUGH INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. ARE AT BUT WE DO HAVE ENOUGH APPLICANTS INTO THE UC SYSTEM TO INCREASE OUR ADMISSIONS BEYOND THE- OF TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THAT I ALREADY DISCUSSED. OF CLOSE THE BUDGET HAS NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED AND UNIVERSITY DOESN'T YET HAVE THAT INVOLVEMENT FUNDING. WE CAN'T START HIRING FACULTY BECAUSE WE HAVE NO FUNDING TO BRING THEM ON BOARD UNTIL- JULY FIRST WHEN THE BUDGET WILL BECOME LAW. SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE UNABLE TO START THE HIRING PROCESS FOR THE FACULTY THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR THE SIX THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS- WE MAY BE ABLE TO I KNOW WE CAN IN ROLE THAT MANY STUDENTS OVER THREE YEARS. AND THERE MAY BE WAYS TO ACCELERATE IT TO TWO YEARS. YES THAT'S A GOOD POINT SO I KNOW THERE'S DEBATE AND LA I WAS SAYING WE SHOULDN'T GIVE YOU ALL THE MONEY FOR THAN SIXTY TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING ON ROLE THEN- IF WE DID KEEP IT IN THERE WHAT WHAT WITH THE COMMITMENT BE THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM. THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO THE- TWENTY TWENTY THREE YOU SEE YOU YOU WOULD HAVE THE MONEY THERE JULY ONE- AND FRANKLY WE THINK YOU COULD HAVE STARTED MAKING THE HIRING DECISIONS IN THE SPRING YOU GET THE MONEY A FEW MONTHS LATER IN JUNE ANYWAY BUT WE- KIND OF. WE CROSS THAT. BRIDGE SO WE CAN'T GO BACK HERE. SO WHAT TYPE OF COMMITMENT WILL BE HAVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO THE END TO THE ENTIRE. SIXTY TWO HUNDRED NUMBER. FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD UTILIZE THE 5% BASED BUDGET ALLOCATION PROPOSED IN THE MULTI YEAR COMPACT. TO ENROLL AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. FOOTBALL TWENTY TWENTY THREE NO I GET THAT IT I'M SAYING THAT IF WE GIVE YOU THE ENTIRE MONEY THAT SLATED THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR WHICH IS FUNDING FOR THE SIXTY TWO HUNDRED. AND YOU SAID YOU WE CAN'T DO IT FOR THIS FALL'S TOO LATE- WE COMMIT TO HAVE THAT ENTIRE NUMBER FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE IF WE FIND THE ENTIRE AMOUNT. THIS THIS THIS YEAR. WE ARE HOPING TO UTILIZE STEVE FUNDING PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TOWARDS OUR CURRENT OVER TARGET. STUDENTS YEAH SO WE WOULD NEED A FURTHER INCREASE IN FUNDING IN ORDER TO. INCREASE ENROLLMENT BEYOND THE TWO THOUSAND THAT WERE ALREADY COMMITTED TO TAKE ON IN FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE CATCHES SO LET'S JUST STOP RIGHT HERE SO I GET THAT I'M IN TOTAL AGREEMENT. AND HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW BUT I TALKED TO. BUDGET CHAIR TEAM JUST BEFORE THE HEARING STARTED AND WE WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT. THAT WE'RE WE ARE WE ARE WILLING TO REVERSE THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE. DURING THE RECESSION. WHERE WE DON'T TRUE UP AFTER THE YEAR TO FULLY FUND. MINISTERED AS A SALAD BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S ART ON ADMISSIONS WHO ACTUALLY SHOWS UP. SO WE SO WE GET THAT. WE WOULD RATHER YOU KNOW ERR ON THE SIDE OF. OF HAVING MORE STUDENTS AND PAPERS TO ANSWER SHOW UP THEN THEN THERE THAN THE. REVERSE SO- HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER. TO DO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHICH IS FUNDS THAT THE SPIKE THAT YOU GOT DURING THE KOBE LAST TWO YEARS I KNOW IT WAS HARD YOU CAN PREDICT TWO SHOWING UP AND ADMISSIONS AND ENROLLMENT IS THAT. AGAIN AN ART NOT A SCIENCE YOU NOT ALWAYS CERTAINLY PRECISE IT TOOK. TWO YEARS TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE MATHEMATICAL ERRORS WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM WARRANT TODAY ITSELF THAT'S ON YOUR ALL AND BUT WE UNDERSTAND IF. WE GET THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE ON THESE CAMPUSES SO YES. SO HOW CAN WE FULLY FUND THOSE AND GET THE SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WE- HAD OUR DESIRE TO. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO AT. THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS THAT ARE IN THERE TODAY. AND THE SEVEN THOUSAND BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHAT IS TO HAPPEN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. ABOUT THAT WOULD BE- THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF EXERCISE DO THAT SO EACH ONE THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY- ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE UC SYSTEM TO TAKE ON- AND SINCE WE'RE PROPOSING TO TAKE ON TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED. AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THAT IT'S GOT US TO FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SO THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO BE FUNDED FROM ADDITIONAL FUNDS I GET THAT BUT AGAIN FORTY SIX HUNDRED IS WAY LESS THAN THAT. SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WE DID AND THESE PRESS RELEASES ON LAST SUMMER TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN THE INTERIM YOU'RE SAYING OH BY THE WAY CALIFORNIA WE OVER AND ROLL THESE OTHER STUDENTS WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND SO. WE'RE SAYING WE'RE WE AGREE WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK TO FULLY FUND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF LIKE A TRUE UP AFTER THE YEAR HOW MANY WE HAVE WILL FULLY FUND THE MARGINAL COST THOSE ACTUAL STUDENTS. BUT WE STILL WANT TO NOT LOSE SIGHT ON. THE HIGHER NUMBER AND WHY DOES THIS MATTER BECAUSE IT GOES BACK TO YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT THE RECORD NUMBER OF APPLICANTS. IS BACK THE FACT THAT. EMPLOYERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SAY MANY MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES FOR TO FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THIS REALLY MATTERS. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO PUSH- TO THE HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR I HEAR THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO GET THE GRADES TO GET INTO UC- WE WILL WORK WITH YOU TO SEE HOW MANY MORE SUDENTS WE COULD. ENROLL TO REACH THAT SIX THOUSAND STUDENT GOALS SOONER- WILL NEED APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR SO IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS. FOR THOSE FOR THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND A SEVEN THOUSAND THAT. WE'RE DISCUSSING NOW. AND WE WILL WORK TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN I DON'T SEE THAT IS THE IS THE ISSUE. HI MR LEGIA COMES YOUR QUESTION. OKAY WHAT WILL CERTAINLY- MOVE ON HOLD THIS ISSUE BUT JUST TO SUMMARIZE WE'RE GOING TO COORDINATE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE TRUE AT AND FOCUS ON THE EXISTING STUDENTS AND PUT THE RESOURCES IN THIS BUDGET TO ACHIEVE THAT THE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE OUTLINED- FOR THAT FOR THAT SEVEN THOUSAND NUMBER TO YOU KNOW. MAXIMIZE PARTICIPATION OF OUR INCOMING FRESHMAN. AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- SO WITH THAT WE WILL GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE BASE BUDGET THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL BUDGET PROPOSAL WITH THE BASE BUDGET THE INCREASE OF 5% FOR YOU SEE CORPORATIONS- WHICH DOES INCLUDE- A 1% ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS WELL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES GOOD MORNING JACK SWELLED FROM FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS THE COMPACT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THIS CONTACT PROVIDES CONSISTENT PREDICTABLE SUPPORT TO YOU STATE THAT WILL SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY'S CORE OPERATIONS AND A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE OF TWO AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES PROVIDED TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT WHICH WE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THIS HEARING. THE CONTACT CALLS FOR AN ANNUAL 5% INCREASE THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN- PROVIDED YOU SEE ADVANCES SHARED GOALS- DESIGNED INCREASE ACCESS ADVANCE EQUITY WRITTEN REDUCE COSTS TO STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND PETS COLLABORATION AND ALIGNMENT WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. HAVE A RESTAURANTS AFTER MICHAEL. AT PRESENT. THANK YOU LA UP- BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I JUST WANNA. NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED BASED INCREASE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU SEE IS PLANNING TO INCREASE TUITION AS PART OF A MULTI YEAR TUITION PLAN YOU SEE BORDER IT'S A DOCTOR- LAST YEAR. BUT OF OUR NOSE THAT WAS ESTIMATED TO BRING IT APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO- COMBINED WITH THE PROPOSED BASED INCREASE THAT WOULD GIVE YOU SEE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NEED BASED SUPPORT. TO WORK WITH THAT COVER. CORE OPERATIONAL COST INCREASES. WEAPON OF YOUR GENDER DESCRIBES OUR ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS- ANALYSIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMMITTEE AS PER SE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST AS- OF THE COMMITTEE IS NOTED- YOU KNOW BATES INCREASES ARE. SORT OF A LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO COMPOSE. AND INVESTORS WE'VE FOUND BATES INCREASE APPROACH TO BE NOT A GREAT. APPROACH TO BUDGETING. IT A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN LACKS A CLEAR RATIONALE CONNECTION TO ACTUAL COSTS THAT THE- UNIVERSITIES ATTENDING THIS IMPORTANT GIVE THE LEGISLATURE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT IT IS PACIFIC WAS SUPPORTED. WITH THE AUGMENTATION. I WOULD RECOMMEND A CONNECTING ROOM TO MORE SPECIFIC AS TO. FOR EXAMPLE LET'S COULD CANNOT DOCUMENT. TO ACTUAL COSTING THAT THE UNIVERSITY AND- AT THE CURRENT IN THE BUDGET. THANKS AS DEBT SERVICE OPERATING EXPENSES EQUIPMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFIT INCREASES AN EMPLOYEE'S SALARY INCREASES. NOW ONE THING I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT OUR ASSESSMENT IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE HARD RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO THE EXACT LEVEL OF AUGMENTATION THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROVIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY THAT'S ALTERNATELY SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATURE ONE A WEIGHT BASED ON ITS- GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES AFTER REVIEWING UC'S- COST PRESSURES THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIKE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INCREASES WARRANTED WE ESTIMATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD SUPPORT UC'S. FIXING FOR OPERATING COST INCREASES. AND ALSO SUPPORT BY NEARLY 3% INCREASE IN POINTS OUT. HOW TO REQUEST MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT A TERMINATION OF MY DETERMINE THAT A HIGHER AUGMENTATIONS WARRANTED DUE TO. YOU KNOW HOW INFLATION PRESSURES THAT COULD PUT PRESSURE TO. INCREASE US SALARIES FOR EMPLOYEES OR ALTERNATIVELY YOU COULD DETERMINE THAT A LOWER OF MAGICIANS WANTED. HELLO FOR BASED ON THE STATE COULD PASS BASED ON THE THAT YOU SEE IS BERKELEY IS. PRETTY COMPETITIVE IN TERMS OF ITS COMPENSATION PACKAGES FOR EMPLOYEES HER POINT IS THAT THOSE SHOULD FACTOR SHOULD BE THIS OR BASIS FOR- LEGISLATIVE DETERMINATION. NOT ARBITRARY THESE INCREASES DETERMINE ANY GRIEVANCE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND BOB UNIVERSITY. QUARTERFINAL WE JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT FEEL BEHOLDEN TO CONNECT TO THE MULTI YEAR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LARGE FRAME THE- ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. I JUST BECAUSE THAT REMAINS RICH BETWEEN THEM THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD STILL RETAIN ITS- AND YOU WILL OF AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THE BUDGET PROPOSALS AND THE SPECIAL PROPOSALS EACH YEAR. BASED ON THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT PRESENTED EACH YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU OF THE UNIVERSITY IS THANKFUL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED MULTI YEAR FUNDING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND INVOLVEMENT GROWTH THE PROPOSED FOR FIVE YEARS WOULD PROVIDE STABILITY AND SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY AS WE UNDERTAKE IMPORTANT AN AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR ACCESS EQUITY AND AFFORDABILITY HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR IN RECENT YEARS HAS ALLOWED US TO ENROLL THOUSANDS OF NEW CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CONDUCT RESEARCH ON ISSUES IMPACTING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE. FROM AGRICULTURE TO HEALTH THE CHILDREN'S LEARNING LOSS. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CHOSE TO INVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP IN SUPPORTING OUR SHARED GOALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S EXCELLENCE. WE HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH A CHALLENGING PANDEMIC FOR TWO YEARS OUR FACULTY AND STUDENTS HAVE ADJUSTED TO CHANGING INSTRUCTIONAL MODALITIES AND OUR STAFF HAVE KEPT THE CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND SERVICES GOING STRONG. OUR MEDICAL CENTERS HAVE TENDED TO PATIENTS PROVIDED VACCINES AND CONDUCTED RESEARCH ON COBIT AND ITS IMPACTS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED ADMIRABLY AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S FISCAL AND POLICY CONTRIBUTIONS THE UNIVERSITY HELPED WITH THIS FLEXIBILITY DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AS THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE WITH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL BUDGET OF OVER FORTY FOUR BILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. UNIVERSITY PROVIDES EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICES THAT TOUCH ON THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. TODAY I WILL DISCUSS OUR CORE FUNDS BUDGET WITH YOU THIS IS THE COMPONENT OF THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET THAT FUNDS ARE CAMPUS OPERATIONS. INCLUDING INSTRUCTION. WHAT'S THE STATE CHEN FUND TUITION AND FEES NON RESIDENTS OF. TO AND A FEW SMALLER FUNDS. THE CORE FUNDS BUDGET FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS ESTIMATED AT TEN POINT FIVE BILLION. OR BILLION OF THIS CORE OPERATING BUDGET IS PROVIDED US ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND. ANOTHER ONE BILLION COMES IN DIRECTLY FROM STATE IN THE FORM OF CAL GRANT TO MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIPS TO COVER STUDENTS TUITION. THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET PROPOSES FOUR POINT THREE BILLION AN ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND AND TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. FOR TOTAL BUDGET OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION THE PROPOSED 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE WOULD PROVIDE TO UNIVERSITY WITH TWO HUNDRED POINT FIVE MILLION. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO SUSTAIN CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND HELP UNIVERSITY UNDERTAKE POLICY CALLS FOR ACCESS EQUITY AFFORDABILITY. AND COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CSU. CAMPUS OPERATING COST INCREASES THAT THE UNIVERSITY FACES INCLUDE CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED REPRESENTED LABOR SALARY INCREASES DEBT SERVICE ON OUR BUILDINGS FACULTY OF POLICY COVERED STAFF INCREASES AND GENERAL OPERATING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. THE PROPOSED BASED BUDGET INCREASES FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS COUPLED WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S COVERT BASS TUITION ADJUSTMENTS WILL PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY WITH RESOURCE ABILITY TO GROW ENROLLMENT RESPONSIBLY. MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS ON CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS AND BEGIN OFFERING DEBT FREE EDUCATION OPTIONS. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE COURT BASED TUITION AND FEES ARE ESTIMATED TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE MILLION IN OPERATING REVENUE. AND THIRTY THREE POINT. SEVEN MILLION IN FINANCIAL AID. RECOGNIZING ACCESS MUST BE PARTNERED WITH SUCCESS THE REGION'S HAS SET OF GOAL AND OUTLINED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR CLOSING GRADUATION GAPS. WHILE THE CARD FOR YOUR OVERALL GRADUATION RATE IS SEVENTY TWO POINT 6% THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IS SIXTY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT. THE UNIVERSITY WANTS TO ENHANCE STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION ADVISING TUTORING AND BOLSTER ANALYTICAL TOOLS TO ALLOW FOR EARLY ACADEMIC INTERVENTION AND SUPPORT INNOVATIONS IN INSTRUCTION. INSTRUCTIONAL DELIVERY METHODS FOR CLOSING THIS GRADUATION GAP. IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE DEVELOP NEW FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS. THE UNIVERSITY SHARES THIS GOAL OF DEBT FREE EDUCATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. PRESIDENT DRAKE HAS DISCUSSED HIS INTENT TO MOVE TOWARDS DEBT FREE EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE OF STATE AND FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS WE WILL BEGIN MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS GOAL. THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS FOR FINANCIAL AID GROW SO WILL OUR PROGRAMS TO OFFER ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS THESE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS COMBINED WITH THE STABILITY PROVIDED BY THE UNIVERSITY'S COHORT BASED TUITION. WILL PROVIDE ASSURANCE TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT. THEY CAN AFFORD HIGHER EDUCATION. ORDERS BY ALSO ESTABLISH GOALS FOR THE YEAR. COLLAB WITH COLLEGES AND CSU THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREASING INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION IN RECENT YEARS WHAT TWENTY ONE THE STOPPAGE TRANSFER PATHWAYS FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO UC. STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AN EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS TO PREPARE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE TRANSFERRED TO CSU OR UC AND WORKING WITH STATE PARTNER AGENCIES ON A BLUEPRINT FOR THE CRADLE TO CAREER SYSTEM. THE COLLABORATION GOALS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCREASES COLLABORATION AND LEVERAGE DISTRICTS OF EACH PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENT. WITH THE SHARED GOALS IN MIND THE UNIVERSITY OF REQUEST FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASED BUDGET INCREASE OF 5% THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TRY MISTER LEE NO I BACK TO- THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH ISSUE ON THE BASE BUDGET SO THIS WOULD THIS IS- THE PROPOSAL FOR THE GOVERNOR IS FIVE YEARS PER YEAR OVER A OF YEARS AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND IT'S AT STATE BUDGET WHICH HAS TO BE AGREED UPON YEAR BY YEAR FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT- YOU KNOW I ASSUME AB A STRONG APPETITE EVERY YEAR FOR THE LEGISLATURE- THERE ALWAYS. HAS BEEN RELAYED TO FULLY FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I HOW DO WE- CALCULATE. HOW MUCH OF THIS WOULD WOULD WOULD GO OF THE 5% TO FUNDS IN ROMAN GROWTH IS THAT AUTOMATICALLY BUILT IN OR IS THAT A FLEXIBLE NUMBER EACH YEAR WHAT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ARRANGEMENT ALASKA THE UC TO START WITH THAT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THINKS THE 5% WILL COVER THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS ANNUALLY AT A COST OF ABOUT TWENTY THREE MILLION. COMING OUT OF THAT 5% ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT'S RIGHT ANNUAL GROSS OF 1% SO EACH YEAR BUILDING ON THE NEXT ONE TWO THOUSAND THERE'S SLOTS ANNUALLY. OKAY SO TWO THOUSAND SLOTS ANNUALLY. IS WELL OVER TEN YEARS THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND. SO IF WE IF WE- FUNDED THE THAT IT INCREASE ENROLLMENT LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- THIS IS LIKE COMPOUNDING NUMBER SO HOW HOW- WILLING IS THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WHY THIS GOES BACK TO YOUR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS A KIND OF A- MICROCOSM OF THE DEBATE WITH UC BERKELEY- HOW READY IS THE UNIVERSITY ABLE TO- TO GET TO THAT TWENTY THOUSAND NUMBER BY TWENTY THIRTY. OR EVEN THIRTY THOUSAND. WHERE WHERE PREPARE TO GET TO TWENTY THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH INCLUDES. SIXTEEN THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES A COMPONENT OF WHICH WOULD OF THE REPLACEMENT OF NON RESIDENTS WITH RESIDENTS. AND IS THAT IS THAT NUMBER. A REACH ABOVE THAT IS THAT THE CONSTRAINTS BASED UPON MONEY OR IS IT BASED UPON YOUR CAMPUS IS NOT IN HAVING THE CAPACITY WITH. SPACE TO LAND AND SO FORTH SO IF THE IF THERE WAS A MEETING OF THE MINDS OF DESIRE TO GO TO THIRTY THOUSAND WHICH MISTER KING AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO MISTER DRAKE ABOUT. AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AND CERTAINLY SAID THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO GO NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND WHAT ARE SOME OF THAT CONSTRAINTS TO SUCH. A GOAL TODAY. TODAY THE CONSTRAINTS WOULD BE THE- NUMBER OF ACADEMIC SPACE ON THE CAMPUSES AND THE FACT THAT IT TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO CONSTRUCT A NEW ACADEMIC FACILITY OUR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH ARE GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS FOR THE CAMPUSES THAT INCLUDE ENROLLMENT AS A COMPONENT OF THOSE PLANS WOULD ALLOW FOR EXPANSION OF UP TO FORTY THOUSAND. FIVE NEW STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES BY APPROXIMATELY- TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE DEPENDING ON THE CAMPUS OF BUT THERE IS DEFINITELY ROOM WITHIN THE EXISTING LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR THE CAMPUS IS TO GROW. THE CONSTRAINTS WITH THEN BE BEING ABLE TO HIRE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF FACULTY IN A TIMELY MANNER AND BUILDING ACADEMIC SPACE AND STUDENT HOUSING SO THAT WHEN THE STUDENTS ARRIVE- THEY HAVE SAFE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEAR THE CAMPUS YEAH. YES SO WE'RE WORKING ON THE HOUSING- AS AS WE KNOW AND WE'RE FINDING ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS WE KNOW SO IS THERE A THIRD MISSING PIECES THEIR DESERT. NEEDED ONE TIME FACILITIES MONEY OR DOES THE DOES THE MONEY FOR THAT ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE VIET. YOU KNOW THE INTO ADDITIONAL MARGINAL COSTS FOR EACH STUDENT DOES THAT COVER YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR STAFFING AND FACILITIES NEEDS OR THE B. S. A SEPARATE NEED. DEALING WITH CAPITAL ISSUES. THERE WOULD BE A SEPARATE NEED DEALING WITH CAPITAL ISSUES FOR THE CAMPUSES AND WHAT IS THE AND TIME'S UP AND- I DON'T QUITE HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME WE DO HAVE A ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS REQUEST FOR. THIS- BUDGET YEAR OF THAT WOULD. HELP CAMPUS THAT HAS- RENOVATE AND CONSTRUCT NEW ACADEMIC SPACE AND PREPARATION NEW STUDENTS I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THAT IS- MY UNDERSTANDING IS. NEEDED RETROFITTING IN SIZE MAKE. THEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHICH I DON'T DIMINISH THAT BUT- WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE PLAN. FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ALLOW US TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LOVE WE DON'T IT COULD BE TWO YEARS AND- BACK- WE DIDN'T QUITE GET THE NUMBER RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THIS WAS IS NOT PLEASANT GOING BACK IN FIGHTING OVER. YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE FIRST IN ROME IT'S AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHY THIS MATTERS BECAUSE THERE IS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ARE BEING TURNED AWAY. AND WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS SO. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO PROPERLY PLAN FOR. FIRST FACILITY IN CAPITAL NEEDS- ON TOP OF HOUSING WHICH WE ALREADY ARE ARE WORKING ON AND FULLY FUNDING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS THERE IS THERE A PLAN THE UNIVERSE IS GONNA PUT FOR TWO AT A LONG TERM PLAN A CAPITAL PLAN I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR ONE POINT SEVEN BUT AGAIN. IF I RECALL LOOKING AT THAT A LOT OF THAT IS YOUR EXISTING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SEISMIC NEEDS. THAT'S NOT NEW THAT'S NOT NEW NEWS YOU KNOW LAPSED INTO SPACE YEAR CAPITAL FINANCING PLAN. THAT INCLUDES- ACADEMIC SPACE THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE FUNDING PLANS TOWARDS- WE COULD HAVE SOME OF THAT PLAN FUNDED BY THE STATE. THROUGH A FUNDING MECHANISM YET TO BE DETERMINED. AND THUS MAKE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR THOSE STUDENTS. OKAY THANK YOU SOUTHWESTERLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THIS BRINGS UP AN IMPORTANT POINT SHARING'S IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT YOU KNOW IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE UC EVERY UC CAMPUS TRIES CAN OPERATE IN ITS OWN KINGDOM AND CREATE THEIR OWN ALLERGY PEAS SO HOW AND THAT REALLY GENERATES THEIR LONG TERM EFFICIENCY OF HOW MANY SINCE THEY CAN ENROLL HOW MUCH ACADEMIC SPACE THEY CAN HAVE RIGHT SO IN HAVING THAT PASSED ON TO MY PAST EXPERIENCE IN THE RECENT YEARS LIKE THAT. HOW HOW MUCH COORDINATION IS THE UC OFFICE FRESNO THE REGION'S PUTTING PRESSURE ON ALL THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE ASKING. FOURTH PERHAPS THIRTY THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS ACROSS ENTIRE SYSTEM RIGHT AND YOU NEED LEVEL COORDINATION SAY WELL. SANTA BARBARA YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS MANY DAVID SHOULD TAKE THIS MANY BERKELEY COULD TRY TO GROW IN THIS LEVEL. ARE YOU ARE YOU ALL. COORDINATING THAT KIND OF GROWTH STRATEGY AN OLDER ALREADY PEAS ARE YOU LETTING EACH INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS PUSH ON THEIR OWN. AND FIGURING OUT THAT WAY SO IS IT LIKE A TOP DOWN SYSTEM OR A BOTTOM UP SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER CURRENTLY IT IS A BIT MORE OF A BOTTOM UP. SYSTEM WHERE EACH CAMPUS DEVELOPS THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ARE BASED. AND LOOKING AT WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE FOR THAT CAMPUS AND HOW THEY WANT TO GROW AND DEVELOP- ANNUALLY. THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WORKS WITH THE ADMISSIONS OFFICERS UP EVERY CAMPUS. THE FIRST ASK THEM HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY WANT TO ENROLL AND THEN- FOR FALLING SHORT OF THE LEGISLATIVELY SET GOALS. WE WORK WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO HAVE THEM INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS TO. SEE WHO COULD TAKE ON ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT BUT FIRST WE ALLOWED THE CAMPUS AS- THEY TRY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES. AND SEE IF IT THEN ALIGNS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE GOALS. AND I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND EVERY CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY EMBEDDED HAS OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL WANTS AND NEEDS BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS. WHY THERE'S DIFFERENCE. NONRESIDENT ROMAN THERE'S DIFFERENT STRATEGIES HOUSING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES EVERYWHERE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO PURSUE WRITING A MORE CONSISTENT STATEWIDE GOALS IS. GIVEN ALSO THE MINISTRATION SEEMS TO HAVE THAT AND I THINK YOU SEE SEEMS TO WANT TO DO THAT SO I WOULD URGE HOPEFULLY WE CAN COORDINATE WITH US AT A MORE HIGHER LEVEL. AND FIGURE OUT ITS NOT YOU KNOW US PRESSING DOWN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO DO THIS BUT LIKE HOW CAN WE SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER. RATHER THAN YOU ALL INDIVIDUALLY SAY I ONLY WANT THIS MUCH- I CAN ONLY DO THIS MUCH. AND THAT COORDINATION I THINK HAS RESULTED IN A MORE SCATTERED APPROACH TO ENROLLMENT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE STRUGGLES WE HAVE. SO I HOPE THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH US THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY PRESS ON FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE COORDINATE THESE GOALS RATHER THAN HAVING THE CULTURE OF A- INDIVIDUAL KINGDOMS I'VE KNOWN YOU SEE TO BE. SUFFICIENT BUT I JUST WANT TO HARP ON THAT AS I THINK RELATED TO THE POINT THAT CHEN RICCARDI WAS MAKING SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HOWEVER NONE THANK YOU WILL THAT HOLD THIS ISSUE OR VAN FOOD PROCEED NOW ISSUE NUMBER THREE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. GOOD MORNING JEFF WALKED FROM THE FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME. GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IF YOU SEE. THIS IS PART OF A YEARS LONG TREND OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND IT WASN'T UP TO OUR- PHILIPPINES PRESENT THANK YOU. ALAIA. AS YOU MINISTRATION NOTED- THIS PROPOSAL REFLECTS THROUGH MANY YEARS OF THE STATE PROVIDING ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND YOUR GENERALLY OUR MESSAGE OVER THOSE YEARS HAS BEEN THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS REASONABLE ESPECIALLY FOR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DRESSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS NOW PREVENTS- PROCESS COLLATION IN FUTURE YEARS AND ALSO- POTENTIALLY REDUCES THE RISK FOR. DISRUPTION TO CAMPUS OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM SYSTEM FAILURES. THAT SAID IT- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A- FAIRLY COMPLEX ISSUE AND TO ILLUSTRATE THAT I WOULD TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE FOURTEEN. OF YOUR AGENDA. THE SHORT TABLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE FOURTEEN. AND PRESENTS INFORMATION THAT YOU SEE RECENTLY PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ITS MAINTENANCE NEEDS. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE TABLE YOU SEE ESTIMATES HAVING A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OF SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND ALSO ESTIMATES HAVING A TEN YEAR RENEWAL NEED OF TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT ROOMMATE IS EFFECTIVELY THE ESTIMATE OF WHAT USED TO WOULD HAVE TO SPEND TO PREVENT THAT BACKLOG FROM GROWING OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TEN YEARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT'S- OF NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. CAN YOU SEE SPEND SYSTEM WIDE A LITTLE UNDER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON MAINTENANCE. SUBSTANTIAL GAP BETWEEN WHAT YOU SEE IS CURRENTLY SPENDING AND- SORT OF OVERALL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT UC'S ESTIMATING. SO GIVEN THAT INFORMATION YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE PROPOSED OF FUNDS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- BUT THEN SECONDLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE START THINKING LONGER TERM ABOUT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SERVER GIVEN THE COMPLEX ISSUES HERE. NOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO RESULT IN THE END OF THIS BUDGET CYCLE IT'LL PROBABLY BE A MULTI YEAR PLAN WE CAN START NOW COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE START THINKING ABOUT. HOW TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ON ON GOING BASIS HOW TO ENSURE THAT UC'S ADEQUATELY PROVIDING FUNDING TO ADDRESS ITS MAINTENANCE NEEDS IN. DEVELOPING A LONG TERM PLAN TO DEVELOP THE MAINTENANCE HELLO MANY THE MEANS BY FONG. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR FOR PAST SUPPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY'S DEPARTMENT AND SUBURBS THE APPROPRIATIONS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDING THE FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENTS HAVE HELP TO RESOLVE THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM FAILURES AND HAVE A LOT OF CAMPUS IS TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS UC'S CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS CAMPUSES WILL UTILIZE THESE FUNDS TO RENEW BUILDING SYSTEMS ENSURE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS AND IMPROVE EERGY EFFICIENCY IN CAMPUS BUILDINGS I REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT. UNIVERSITIES CAPITAL NEEDS ARE GREAT AND WE ARE REQUESTING THE LEGISLATURE FOR A TOTAL OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO ADDRESS A COMBINATION OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SEISMIC.% FUNDS NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TOWARD CLASSROOM BUILDING RENEWABLE AND CONSTRUCTION OF NEW ACADEMIC SPACE THIS INVESTMENT IN ACADEMIC FACILITIES IS IMPORTANT TO ACCOMMODATE THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS WROTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY PROPOSES TO UNDERTAKE BY TWENTY THIRTY TO BE CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR DEGREES. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OUR CAMPUSES RECEIVE A THIRD OF THEIR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY HOWEVER SIX OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE THEIR OWN NATURAL GAS HEATING POWER PLANTS CONSTRUCTED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES DECOMMISSIONING THOSE FACILITIES WILL TAKE TIME AND BE EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CARBON EMISSIONS. BECAUSE OF THIS OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING REQUEST INCLUDES CAMPUS DECARBONISATION STUDIES. UNIVERSI OCCUPIES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION GROSS SQUARE FEET OF SPACE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS CAMPUSES HAVE ENGAGED IN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO EVALUATE THE COST OF CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR NEW LEADS. AND DETERMINED THAT SYSTEM WIDE CAMPUSES HAVE TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION NEED WITHIN EXISTING BUILDINGS. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES A SIZABLE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND SEISMIC RENOVATION OF OUR AGING BUILDINGS. UNIVERSITY USES INTEGRATED CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR I CAN'T TO TRACK DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS ARE LISTED AS READ IN THE EYE CAMPS SYSTEM AND THE UNIVERSITY CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION AND READ CATEGORY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST BUDGET A PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR WILL UNIVERSITY MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ADDRESSING THESE CRITICAL PROJECTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UC MERCED UC CAMPUSES WERE MAINLY CONSTRUCTED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES OR EARLIER. USE ORIGINAL BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE NOW NEED SIGNIFICANT REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS WELL CAMPUS ROUTE. KNOWN PROJECTS TO FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION LIST THE PAST USEFUL AGE INFRASTRUCTURE RECORDED AN EYE CAMP COULD FAIL AT ANY TIME. THIS WILL LEAD TO MORE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTION AND HOW THESE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS CAN BE ADDRESSED YOU HAVE VERY FUNDING INSTRUMENTS BUT YOU CAN AUTHORIZED. DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS ARE PREFERABLE FOR SMALLER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS THAT KEEP COMING UP AS INFRASTRUCTURE AGES. FOR SEISMIC RENOVATION IF DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS OR GRANTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WE WHICH FAVOR AND NO INTEREST REVOLVING LOAN FUND DEDICATED. FOR THAT PURPOSE THANK YOU. THANK I WILL WHAT'S THE ROCK DRAKE A QUESTION FOR YOU SEE WHAT'S THE ROUGH BREAKDOWN OF YOUR- IN YOUR CAPITALIST HERE. FIRST DID YOU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE VERSES- SEISMIC. WITH R. ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR REQUEST YEAH THAT WOULD BE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEN THE OTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS- INCLUDES BOTH SEISMIC AND CLASSROOM RENEWAL AND SOME NEW ACADEMIC FACILITIES IS THIS I'D MAKE IT RENEWED. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD SIR. YES SO IT IS SEISMIC- RENOVATIONS AND THEN WE WOULD ALSO DO A COVER UP REPAIRS. WITHIN THE BUILDING SO WOULD TAKE CARE MULTIPLE CATEGORIES AT THE SAME TIME. IS THIS SIZE MAKE PRIMARILY UC BERKELEY. NO EACH CAMPUS WOULD RECEIVE SOME AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS A PRIMARILY CAL. THE SEISMIC LEST. NO ACTUALLY THERE'S OTHER CAMPUSES ON THE SEISMIC LIST AND IN DIVIDING THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS- BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO OF DIRECT SOME OF THAT TO CLASS REMARKABLE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY EACH CAMPUS WOULD RECEIVE SOME FUNDING. OKAY. YEAH WELL WE HAVE THE OVERALL YOU KNOW REQUEST IN THIS IS ALWAYS A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY SO HE CERTAINLY WILL SEE WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. AFTER WE COME UP WITH THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AFTER THE MAY REVISE AND WE'LL- GET BACK. TO YOU ON THIS ISSUE SMALL THIS ISSUE OPEN QUESTIONS WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DR CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. I OFTEN WONDERED WHY NO UC SYSTEM- OR ANY OF THE STATE AGENCIES- I DO NOT PLAN ON. SETTING ASIDE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF- MAINTENANCE. COST RATHER THAN USING UP- THE ENTIRE BUDGET AND YOUR BUDGET AND ACCUMULATE THAT BACKLOG OFF THE MAINTENANCE PROBLEM ARE AND THAT YEARS LATER- ASK FOR LUMP SUM TO CATCH UP WITH THAT THE- ARE IN YOUR DATA I SEE WHAT THE TWO POINT NINE SOMETHING BILLION DOLLARS OF BACKLOG GOT US- TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND IF I WAS STILL PRESIDENT- OR EVEN MY OWN HOUSE- TO MAKE IT EASY I GOT I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SAVE IF I SOME NOW REPAIR NEEDS TO BE DONE IF A ROOF WAYS- LEAKING ARE GONNA SPEND- TONY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND OF QUESTION IS A HOME OR A CELL COMMONSENSE. WHY ARE YOU SEE SYSTEM YES AND NOT PRACTICING THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPENDS OR IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE SPENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION ON CAMPUS MAINTENANCE. SPENDING ONCAMPUS MAINTENANCE IS A OF. RED CALLED THE CAMPUS LEADERSHIP HAVE TO MAKE. TWENTY MAINTAINING THE FACILITIES I'M PROVIDING STUDENT SERVICES AND INSTRUCTION SO THOSE ARE THE COMPETING NEEDS ON THE CAMPUS AND BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND WE HAVE pSO MANY NEEDS THAT ARE EMERGING WITHIN STUDENT COMMUNITY CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN STUDENTS. THROUGH DIRECT SERVICES AND INSTRUCTION- WHILE WE DO RECEIVE FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM THE STATE OF BECAUSE OUR CAMPUSES ARE NOW REACHING THAT POINT OF AGING- WHERE MANY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE STARTING TO FAIL OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS GROWING FASTER THAN OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS IT. YEAH THE WORD THIS OFFICE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OUT THAT THIS- LATER IT'LL COST YOU EVENTUALLY MORE BECAUSE TO IT THAT THE PROBLEM OR PART OF COMPOUND A RATHER THAN MAINTAINING IT IS- AT THE LAST BLAST SO COST OF SO. I WISH IS TAMPA SO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE- SUBGROUP BUDGET ASIDE IS SET ASIDE AND- REGULARLY MAINTAINED SO THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO ISSUE OF FOUR SO CALLED THE BACK ROW GOOD MENTORS SO PROBLEM SO AND- EVENTUALLY COSTING- YOUR INSTITUTION. OR EVEN- TAXPAYERS MONEY. THAT'S A COMMON. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE- ISSUES NUMBER FOUR THESE ARE THEM MISCELLANEOUS PROPOSALS FROM THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED. MORE INJECTS WILL DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A NUMBER OF OTHER EXCITING PROPOSALS INCLUDING SIX MILLION WHO ARE. I'M GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WITH THE UC. TWO MILLION DOLLARS ARE GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE UC'S FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER. HI AND A TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO THE UC SAN FRANCISCO DYSLEXIA CENTER FOR RESEARCH- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE COUNSELING. SERVICE COORDINATION AND OTHER RELEVANT STUDENTS SUPPORTS TO HELP FOSTER- YOU TO COMPLETE COLLEGE- THE AMBITIONS FOR FIREARM AND SELECTS A RESEARCH. ALSO BUILT ON SEVERAL YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL INVESTMENTS. HE'S IN THE RESOURCES WILL HELP BOTH CENTERS INCREASE RESEARCH AND IN THE CASE OF THE CSS DISLIKES IS THAT OUR- FURTHER VALIDATE YOU DEVELOPMENT OF AN EARLY SCREENING TOOL- THANKS AND AGAIN HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS FONG TRANSCRIPTION. THANK YOU. HERE IS THE CALIFORNIA LOL. THAT PROPOSED ISSUE FOR A WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH ONE OF THOSE PROPOSALS WHICH IS AROUND DYSLEXIA RESEARCH TO LOOK FOR A FINAL FOCUS MY COMMENTS JUST ON THAT PROPOSAL. NOW YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE STATE PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING TO THE UC SAN FRANCISCO DYSLEXIA CENTER IN PAST YEARS AND AT ONE TIME FUNDING. IS INTENDED TO HELP DEVELOP A NEW SCHOOL A SCREENING TOOL. THAT HELPS FLAG EARLY AND EARLY SIGNS OF LEARNING CHALLENGES BUT THAT WITH THAT AND I'LL SUPPORT EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND POTENTIALLY pPREVENT STUDENTS FROM. LACED INTO US EDUCATION. OVERARCHING OBJECTIVES OF THAT PROPOSAL SHE REACHED HER REASONABLE TO US WE HAVE TWO CONCERNS THE FIRST IS THAT THE PROPOSAL TO DATE HAS VERY LITTLE STATUTORY GUIDANCE FOR REPORTING AROUND IT BUDGET DEFEATED MINISTRATION HAS REALLY DEFINED THE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DYSLEXIA CENTER RATHER THAN THE LGISLATURE AND THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE REPORTING ABOUT LEGISLATURE OTHER ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE THE LONG TERM. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS LITTLE INFORMATION AS TO HOW THE PROJECT TO BE SCALED STATEWIDE. DURING THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT FUNDING- WE RECOMMEND ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES BY ADOPTING MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE. AND ALSO ADOPTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THANK. THANK YOU YOU SEE. THANK YOU I WILL REVIEW THE PROPOSALS AND THE ORDER THAT THEY APPEAR IN YOUR AGENDA. FOR FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE OBSTACLES FACED BY FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES SIX MILLION AN ONGOING. FUNDS FOR STUDENT SERVICES AND ACADEMIC ADVISING SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THESE STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY OVERCOME TREMENDOUS OBSTACLES IN PURSUING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS pSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WHEN THEY MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS GRADUATION. THIS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WILL ASSIST THEM ON THE PATH TO SUCCESSFUL GRADUATION CURRENTLY UC CAMPUSES HAVE FOSTER YOU SERVICES PAID FOR WITH DONATIONS AND GRANTS. THE CAMPUSES HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED DEDICATED FOSTER YOUTH SERVICES WITH STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THIS PROPOSED ONGOING STATE FUNDING WILL ENSURE THE CAMPUS AGAIN HIRE PERMANENT PROFESSIONAL STAFF RATHER THAN RELYING ON TEMPORARY CONTRACTS. OR APPROACH TO YOUTH ARE TWO AND A HALF MORE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS THAN OTHER STUDENTS AND MORE LIKELY TO REPORT FOOD INSECURITY. ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC ADVISING AND SUPPORT SERVICES WOULD HELP THE STUDENTS GET ACCESS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GRADUATE AND THRIVE WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIX MILLION. MOVING ON THE FIREARMS RESEARCH FIREARMS ARE HEALTH CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND TWO AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONE CALIFORNIANS DIED EVERY THREE HOURS FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN TWENTY NINETEEN ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL CALIFORNIA DIED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS. FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE GUNSHOT WOUNDS. ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. REDRESS THIS PUBLIC CRISIS THE LEGISLATURE CODIFY TO MAKE OF THE U. OF. FIREARM RESEARCH CENTER AT UC DAVIS AS AN ACADEMIC AND POLICY RESEARCH CENTER THE CENTER FOR AREAS OF ACTIVITY INCLUDE RESEARCH ASSISTANTS TO POLICY MAKERS TRAINING AND EDUCATION FOR RESEARCHERS PRACTITIONERS AND THE PUBLIC. AND MEDICAL HEALTH PROVIDER EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT OPTIONAL GRANT PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE RESEARCH BY OTHERS. THE CENTERS WILL APPOINT PROJECTS HAS DEVELOPED A CURRICULUM TO TEACH MEN MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ABOUT FIREARM INJURY PREVENTION. THE CENTER IS NOW DISSEMINATING THIS CURRICULUM AND EVALUATING ITS EFFECTIVENESS. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE TWO MILLION PROPOSED TO CONTINUE THIS CRITICAL WORK. I'M DYSLEXIC CENTER. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TEN MILLION FOR THE UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER CONDUCT TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AND BUILD UP THE CAPACITYOF SCIENCE TO DEVELOP ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION PRACTICES FOR CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA. THE CENTER IS DEVELOPING A TOOL CALLED MULTITUDE STAFF WILL PROVIDE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY INCLUSIVE SCIENCE BASED ASSESSMENT OF YOUNG CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA. HAS PRACTICES HAVE TESTED CHILDREN IN THIRD GRADE OR LATER ONLY AFTER THEY DEVELOP NOTICEABLE LEARNING DIFFICULTIES AND THEN ONLY IN ENGLISH. AT THIS POINT MANY CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA HAVE ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND IN LEARNING AND MUST ENTER SPECIAL INSTRUCTION CLASSROOM. THE MULTITUDES PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A DIGITAL PLATFORM TOOL THAT TEACHERS CAN OPERATE WITHOUT A SPECIALIST PRESENT THE SCREENING WILL TAKE TWENTY MINUTES FOR THE SECOND TWENTY MINUTES SCREENING FOR CHILDREN WHO STRUGGLE WITH THE FIRST STEP. THE SYSTEM SCREENS KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF RISK FOR LEARNING CHALLENGES BEFORE THE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE FAILURE. SCHOOLS CAN BEGIN EARLY INTERVENTION BEFORE THE CHILD FALLS BEHIND OR HAS TO BE PLACED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING. VERY QUICKLY I WOULD LIKE TO READ YOUR SUPPORT UC REGENTS BUDGET REQUEST NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FIRST OF THESE IS THE STUDENT ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND EDUCATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS ARE SAFE BUT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES A THROUGH G. COURSES THE STUDENTS FROM HIGH SCHOOLS DO NOT OFFER A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THOSE COURSES. IN ADDITION AP COURSES SUMMER ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND MENTORING OUR OFFER TO ENCOURAGE HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ATTEND A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ON GOING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. AT A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT LEARNING IMPACTS FOR LOW INCOME DISTRICTS THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE PANDEMIC GENERATION DOES NOT LOSE OUT ON HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SECOND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIX MILLION FOR HER FOSTER YOUTH SERVICES. AND REQUEST YOUR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR OTHER VULNERABLE STUDENTS FIVE MILLION FOUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FOUR MILLION FOUR IN CARCERAL SYSTEM IMPACTED STUDENTS. THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW CAMPUS IS TO ESTABLISH DEDICATED PROGRAMS FOR ADVISING AND SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOR MILLION ON GOING FOR THE UC CANCER CONSORTIUM FOR UNIFIED STRATEGY TO LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE STRENGTH AND SCALE OF THE UC SYSTEM TO IMPROVE CANCER CARE AND PATIENT ACCESS. A BETTER STORE OF THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA THE CANCER CENTER WOULD PROVIDE A CURRENT CANCER DATABASE FOR PRECISION ONCOLOGY. PUBLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS GREAT TEAMS OF DISEASE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND OFFER SECOND OPINIONS. TO PATIENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THESE PROPOSALS. SEEING NONE I DO NOT HAVE ANY AS WELL- SEVERAL OF THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE PAST FEW YEARS- SO WE WILL HOLD THESE ISSUES OPENED. AND PROCEED WITH THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. CLIMATE CHANGE PROPOSALS. GOOD MORNING GENTLE BERMAN THANKS ARE EXPIRATION IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR BUDGET SEEKS TO LEVERAGE THE EXPERTISE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM TO FURTHER THOSE AFTER. THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT RESEARCH A MEDICATION WORK- NOTABLY TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS THAT WILL CYSTIC KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FROM THE ACADEMIC BROWN TO THE PRACTICAL. FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS ON ITS CAMPUSES. I WHICH COMPLEMENTS PREVIOUS INNOVATION HUB INVESTMENTS AT THE UC. AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR CLIMATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING AT THE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU L. A. O. PLEASE. SO THIS ISSUE HAS THREE PROPOSALS WITHIN IT ONE FOCUSED ON CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH ONE FOCUSED ON OUR CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY INCUBATORS AND ONE FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE ISSUES. GENERALLY FOR ALL THREE PROPOSALS THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. OTHER PROPOSALS COME WITH JUST A FEW LINES OF PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. THIS IS A FEW LINES DO NOT PROVIDE CLEAR GOALS ESTABLISH PARAMETERS A RELEASE OF THE FUNDS OR ESTABLISH ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. TWENTY MINISTRATION- SOME PROPOSALS LIKE THIS TO THE LEGISLATURE IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES BY PROVIDING MORE STATUTORY GOALS ESTABLISHING BETTER PARAMETERS. ESTABLISHING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE EFFORTS TAKE TIME AWAY FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM OTHER LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO A PART PART OF THE BUDGET. WE THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE REVIEWS THESE PROPOSALS- THERE ARE AREAS YOU COULD- PRIORITIZED OVER OTHERS. FOR EXAMPLE WE THINK OF THE THREE PROPOSALS CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH- COULD BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AMONG THESE PROPOSALS. WE THINK CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH IS AN ACTIVITY THAT COULD HELP- STATED IT'S CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION GOALS. AND ALSO IT'S JUST COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ADAPTATION EFFORTS. IN ORDER TO RETHINK THE LEGISLATURE EVER WERE INTERESTED IN PURSUING- THIS IS A PROPOSAL IT COULD ADOPT- MORE STATUTORY GUIDANCE STOP WISHING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION THAT A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD NOT REQUIRE YOU SEE TO. COORDINATE THE STATE'S VERY AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCIES WHEN DEVELOPING THE RESEARCH AGENDA. WE THINK BECAUSE OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE. YEAH HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU TEASE EFFORTS WOULD ALIGN WITH EXISTING STATE EFFORTS WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PURSUE- OPTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ANY RESEARCH FUNDING AS WELL COORDINATED AMONG THE STATE'S VARIOUS INTERNAL PROTECTION NATURAL RESURGENT RESOURCE ENTITIES. I'M THE SECONDARY EVERYTHING THE LEAD CONVENTION TO WOULD BE. QUITE AN AUDIENCE. OKAY WHERE THAT HAVE SOME. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMUTER IN THE FORMATION NEW BUSINESS THAT DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE PROPOSAL LACKS A LOT OF BASIC DETAILS THAT WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND ITS IMPACT. ON THE CITY CURRENTLY HAS MANY- COLLAGEN COMPETITORS INCLUDING A FEW THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES. AT HAND THE PROPOSAL DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO REALLY ASSESS HOW THE TO KEEP READERS WOULD ALIGN AND COORDINATE. WITH THESE EXISTING INCUBATORS. THIS IS AN AREA WE THINK THE- WORK IN IN PER MARC BY CHANGING. THE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK AND PROVIDE- MORE INFORMATION FOR SALES. AND IN THE FINAL AREA WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD THEN TURN TO WOULD BE WORKFORCE ISSUES. THIS IS AN AREA WE THINK WOULD BE THE LOWEST PRIORITY AS THE- STATE ALREADY PROVIDES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR ONGOING WORKFORCE PROPOSALS. THE STATE ALREADY PROVIDES ONE TIME FUNDING FOR VARIOUS WORKFORCE INITIATIVES ADOPTED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. SOME OF WHICH APPEAR TO SHARE SOME SIMILAR GOALS TO THE UC PROPOSAL THE REASON WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD REJECT THIS PROPOSAL WITHOUT NECESSARILY PROVIDING MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE GIVEN THE EXISTING LEVEL OF ACTIVITY ALREADY GOING ON THE STREET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU SEE. THANK YOU CLIMATE CHANGE IS A CRISIS IMPACTING THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WHILE THE STATE LEADERSHIP HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARD MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE IT IS CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MITIGATE AND ADAPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COMMITS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES EXPERTISE INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORKS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S NEEDS AND ACCELERATE THE STATE'S PROGRESS TOWARDS A CLIMATE RESILIENCY GOALS THE PURPOSE OF THE THREE PROGRAMS IS TO GENERATE IDEAS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS WELL AS A TRAINED WORKFORCE TO HELP CALIFORNIANS BECOME MORE RESILIENT THE CHANGING CLIMATE. ORDER PROPOSES A AMBITIOUS PLAN OR INNOVATIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RESEARCH FOR CLIMATE ADOPTION STRATEGIES THE PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESEARCH WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR CUTTING EDGE TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE. THESE GRANTS WILL BE UNIQUE IN FINDING INNOVATIVE CONCEPT WORK NOT BUT THROUGH OTHER STATE AGENCIES OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO SEEK NEW KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPLORED. REGIONAL INNOVATION INCUBATORS WILL BE AWARDED BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS O EQUITY REGIONAL CONTEXT LOCAL TRIBAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUTSIDE INVESTMENTS AND RESOURCES. INNOVATION INVESTMENTS ARE CONCEIVED TO COVER A RANGE OF FIELDS AND ACTIVITIES SPENDING AGRICULTURE AND HEALTH TRAINING LAB AND MAKERSPACE ACTIVITIES MULTI DISCIPLINARY NETWORKS OF INCUBATION AND LAB FACILITIES. COMBINED INCUBATOR ACCELERATOR AND CO WORKING SPACES THEY WILL BE OPEN TO INNOVATORS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITIES WITH BROAD PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT FROM INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THE REGIONAL WORK FORCE. ARE INTENDED PRIMARILY TO SERVE UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE STATE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AS WELL AS ALUMNI WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN ON THE JOB TRAINING FOR HUB FUNDED ACTIVITIES. CAREER CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT YEAH YOU SEE EXTENSION AND ON THE JOB TRAINING AT THE INNOVATION HUBS WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO PREPARE CANDIDATES FOR A RANGE OF COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. THESE SERVICES ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED AT INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO ENHANCE AN EXISTING BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR OTHERWISE ENHANCE THEIR. EDUCATION WITH CERT TRAINING. THE OVERALL OBJECT OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE FUNDING OUR CONTRIBUTE TO HELP BY A BY PREDICT. AND JUST AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. PASSING NINE AGAIN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CERTAINLY ARE WELL AWARE WE SUPPORTED INCREASES FOR YOU SEE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH IN THE PRIOR YEARS AND- WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AGAIN THIS YEAR. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- FINALISTS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. UNIVERSITIES ARE THANK YOU SIR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AS ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS AMOUNT SIX HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION OR 69% ARE PASSED THROUGH OR FEEFOR SERVICE FUNDING AN EXAMPLE OF THESE KINDS OF FUNDS ARE THE BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FUNDS UC RECIEVESTHROUGH PROPOSITION FUNDING. THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION IN UNRESTRICTED FUNDING. THESE FUNDS ARE USED FOR SYSTEM WIDE OF COURSE SERVICES PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES AND STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS YOU SEE OKEY BUDGET YOU SEE PATH BUDGET AND THE UC AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES OR YOU SEE A IN OUR BUDGET. THE BUDGET ACTOF TWENTY TWENTY ONE **** THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY FOR USE YOUR P. AND YOU SEE PASSED. THROUGH THE STATE OF CAMPUS ASSESSMENT THAT WAS USED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BEFORE THE UC OP A LINE ITEM. THE STATE HAS DECIDED TO RETAIN YOU SEE A AND R. AS ITS OWN LINE ITEM AND ENHANCE THE STATE WHAT SERVICES THAT YOU SEE A AND R. PROVIDES WITH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING INVESTMENTS. TODAY I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE U. C. O. P. BUDGET. HAVING RETURNED TO CAMPUS ASSESSMENT NOT ONLY IS THE TOTAL USE YOUR BE BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WITH THE SAME AS IT WAS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. BUT FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE REGION'S APPROVAL OF THE TOTAL CAMPUS ASSESSMENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT TWO MILLION WHICH IS THE SAME AMOUNT. AS THE STATE LINE ITEM FOR YOU C. O. P. WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. YOU STILL BE BUDGET TODAY'S NOT THE UC A PRE BUDGET OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO TRANSPARENCY DOCUMENTATION AND DECISION MAKING HAVE BEEN MADE. THESE REFORMS INCLUDE THE FORMATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS VICE CHANCELLORS OF FINANCE AND OTHER CAMPUS LEADERS. WILL REVIEW THE UC O. P. EXPENDITURES AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UC WOULD BE PROGRAMS AND EXPENDITURES. IN ADDITION YOU SEE OP HAS DEVELOPED AND DOCUMENTED A RESERVE POLICY. AND RESEARCH ARE NOT REPORTED REGULARLY FOR THE UC REGENTS ALONG WITH BUDGET AMOUNTS TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. UTILITY IMPLEMENTED AN ENTIRELY NEW BUDGET AND PLANNING SYSTEM. AND COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF EACH YEAR C. O. P. FUND AND ITS USE. THERE WAS ALSO AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO DOCUMENT EACH PROGRAM AN INITIATIVE I'M PROVIDE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF EACH. UC CHANCELLORS REQUESTED TO RETURN TO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT AND THEY DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE CAMPUS WHICH FUNDING SOURCES THEY WILL USED TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT. THE CAMPUS WILL REPORT ON THE FUNDING SOURCES THEY USED FOR THE ASSESSMENT AFTER. THE FISCAL YEAR BOOKS ARE CLOSED. HE SEE REGION'S WILL APPROVE THE PLAN TWENTY TO THE TWENTY. YOU SEE OKAY BUDGET IN MAY. YOU SEE REGION'S WILL APPROACH A FINAL YOU SEE KEYPAD IN JULY. THAT WILL REFLECT ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS ON THE UC BUDGET. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REQUEST THAT YOU ALLOW THE CONTINUATION OF THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT UPON THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND YOU SEE PATH OPERATIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU AT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS ITEM. I DO NOT HAVE ANY WILL HOLD THE SERVICE YES MISTER DOCTOR CHOI CHU THANK YOU- I WONDER. IF FOR A USE O. P. FAR OF SELF EXAMINATION OF- HOW YOUR EACH YEAR AS A BUDGET IS- EFFICIENTLY USED. AND HOW YOU CAN. SAVE MONEY- IT IS SO EASY TO ASK. ANNUAL BUDGET THE TYPICALLY INCREASE THE BUDGET FOR YOUR OPERATION AND THE SYSTEM WIDE THE NEEDS- BUT THE ONCE YOU GET THE FUNDING- I WONDER. WHETHER THERE'S ANY IS SELF EXAMINATION AKA SEVERAL AUDITING- BEFORE STATE DOES- THAT CAN WORK ON A TEAM- EXPENDITURES SO OF ALL- YOU SEE OR PIECE OF BUDGET. I AM NOW pAN AFFLUENT CAN YOU ANSWER THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO IN TERMS OF EVALUATION OF THE U. C. O. P. EXPENDITURES THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOW ABOUT MEETS MONTHLY AND THEN SOME MONTHS- TWICE A MONTH TO GO THROUGH THE UC OF P. EXPENDITURES AND SEE IF THEY ALIGN WITH CAMPUS PRIORITIES- THE COMMITTEE INCLUDES CHANCELLORS OF CAMPUSES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE ASSESSMENT. AND DECIDING IF THEY WANT TO FUND THOSE SERVICES THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING THE UC REGENTS NOW ARE ALSO REGULARLY BRIEFED UP ON Q. C. O. P. ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES- AND ALSO COMPARISON OF BUDGET TO ACTUALS SO THIS IS NEW ACTIVITIES SENSE OF THAT WORD OUT OF PLACE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE UC OP BUDGET REFLECTS THE NEEDS OF THE CAMPUSES AND ONLY SPENDS MONEY ON THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE VALUABLE TO CAMPUSES THAT SAVED. UP FUNDING SYSTEM WIDE. CAN WE CAN. I THINK THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT A FUNCTION THAT THE U. S. C. O. P. S. WHEN YOU ALLOCATE THOUGH- AND YOUR BUDGET SO TO EACH OF WHAT THAT NINE CAMPUSES THANK CAMPUSES SHOWS- I. LOST A NUMBER OF ALL UC SYSTEM IS A CAMPUS TEN CAMPUSES NOW HOW THEY ARE- EFFICIENTLY- THAT THE FUNDING ALLOCATED FUNDING HAS BEEN USED TO AND THE FOR THE PURPOSE- OF- INITIAL BUDGET REQUEST SO I THINK THAT US- YOU SEE OP'S. JOB WITH. THANK YOU SIR- IT DID TO THE- BY THEIR- COMMITTEE AND EVERY CHANCE THEY UC REGENTS HAVE AN INTERNAL AUDITING TEAM THAT FOUGHT ITS U. C. O. P. EXPENDITURES. AND THE REASON DOT AUDIT TEAM IS LOCATED AT THE REGION'S IS THAT SO THAT THEY WOULD BE INDEPENDENT FROM- THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT LEADERSHIP AND ANY CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. BUT WE DO HAVE THAT INTERNAL AUDIT TEAM WHO- EXAMINE DO YOU C. O. P. EXPENDITURES AS WELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RHYS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A TWO PART QUESTION HOW DOES THE UC DETERMINE HOW MUCH EACH CAMPUS IS ASSESSED AND AS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT CONSIDERING INCREASING CAMPUS ASSESSMENT IN. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT IS BASED ON A FORMULA THAT LOOKS AT THE- NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FACULTY AND STUDENTS AT EACH CAMPUS- AS WELL AS THE TOTAL CAMPUS EXPENDITURES. UP TO LOOK AT WHAT THE AMOUNT OF THE ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE THE ASSESSMENT MUST BE APPROVED BY THE REGENTS BEFORE IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED- AND IN TERMS OF A POTENTIAL INCREASE FOR NEXT YEAR. YOU C. O. P- IS PROPOSED WELL PROPOSED TO THE REGENTS IN MAY A NEW BUDGET- AND WE ARE LOOKING AT INCLUDING EIGHT OF THREE PERCENT- STAFF SALARY INCREASE WITHIN THAT BUT THAT HAS NOT AT THIS POINT BEEN APPROVED BY THE REGENTS. THE UC REGENTS MUST APPROVE THE ASSESSMENT LEVEL BEFORE IT CAN BE PASSED ON TO THE CAMPUSES. THANK YOU END OF MY LAST QUESTION IS HOW'S YOU SEE COMPLETED ALL OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE ARE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE AUDITOR THINGS ARE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA JUST CONTINUE TO WORK ON- WE HAVE COMPLETED THE SALARY ASSESSMENT AND RETAINED AN INDEPENDENT. EVALUATOR TO ASSIST US WITH THAT OR- EVEN DEPENDENT EVALUATOR TO ASSIST US WITH THAT- TO ENSURE THAT YOU SEE OKAY SALARIES WERE ALIGNED WITH THE MARKET- AND ALSO THE AUDITOR WOULD. LIKE THE UC REGENTS TO APPROVE AN ANNUAL BUDGET FOR YOU C. O. P. EARLIER IN THE YEAR OF WE ARE STILL DOING A PRELIMINARY BUDGET- FOR UC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IN NOVEMBER. AND EIGHT YOU SEE OKAY BUDGET PRIMARILY IN MAY BECAUSE AT THAT POINT WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT THE- FUNDING LEVELS AND PROGRAM LEVELS THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES WILL BE SO WE ARE STILL NOT APPROVING A FINAL BUDGET UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE PASSES THE BUDGET FOR THE STATE. IT JUST AS A FOLLOW UP WHEN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. OUT WOULD BE COMPLETED. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR- IN REGARDS TO THE- STAFF MEETINGS STAFF SALARY LEVELS WE CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THOSE. UP AND THEN DISSIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE FUTURE LOOK AT MAKING SURE THAT THE SALARY LEVELS FOR STAFF ARE ALIGNED WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES ON THE MARKET- IN TERMS OF THE- APPROVAL OF THESE. UC OKAY BUDGET- WE DO HAVE A PRELIMINARY APPROVAL BEFORE THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINS- BUT BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE AND WILL DOES MAKE CHANGES TO THE UC BUDGET. OF AROUND THE JUNE FIFTEENTH STATE BUDGET ACT BEING PASSED. WE CAN'T REALLY PASS THE FINAL BUDGET. BUT SYSTEM MORE FOR YOU SEE OP BEFORE THAT TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT ARE BEING MADE. IF I MAY MY LAST QUESTION MR. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD THERE'S TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION UNRESTRICTED FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. MY QUESTION IS WHAT PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE. THAT THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REMAINS TRANSPARENT. AND THAT IT DOESN'T GROW SIGNIFICANTLY THERE WAS AN ISSUE. TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO- ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE INPUT OF THE REGION SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO THE BUDGET GROWTH WAS ACTUALLY AN ISSUE PRIOR TO TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE AUDITOR'S REPORT CAME OUT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SINCE THAT TIME YOU C. O. P. REPORTS REGULARLY TO THE REGENTS AND AN EXTENSIVE OF BUDGET. THAT COMPARES- THE- OR PUBLISHED YET TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES I'M PROVIDES ANY FUNDS THAT ARE STILL REMAINING AS WELL OF RESERVES WE ARE UTILIZING. THE DISPLAYED AS RECOMMENDED- OR FORM OF THE DISPLAY AS RECOMMENDED BY THE STATE AUDITOR FOR HOW TO BEST DISPLAY BUDGET INFORMATION TO THE REGENTS SO THAT IS ONE REFORM THAT HAS BEEN DONE- TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY IN ADDITION THERE NOW IS THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT MEETS. OUR COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS AND VICE CHANCELLORS OF BUDGET AND OTHER LEADERSHIP WHO DISCUSS WHETHER OR NOT THE U. C. O. P. FUNCTIONS MEET- CAMPUS EXPECTATIONS FOR SERVICES AND IF THEY ARE ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE CAMPUS IS NEEDED FROM YOU C. O. P. THAT GROUP ALSO MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE- APPROPRIATE FUNDED LEVEL FOR EACH OF THOSE SERVICES. OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PASSED TO THE PRESIDENT AND TO THE REGION'S AND ULTIMATELY IT IS THE UC REGENTS WHO HAVE TO APPROVE THE UC OP BUDGET YOU SEE OKAY CANNOT ALTER DOC BUDGET. WITHOUT WE GENTLE APPROVAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY THANK YOU GOOD QUESTIONS. THE END WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN NEXT ITEM THE FINAL ITEM IS THE TASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. WE HAVE THE HASTINGS REPRESENTATIVES HERE. BERMAN A FINANCE WILL BEGIN EN LA OF IT HE STICKS. ZACKS WITH BERMAN FINANCE- THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAWS BUDGET- AT UC HASTINGS IS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM- BUT IS GOVERNED BY ITS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS. LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO IT PRIMARILY SERVES STUDENTS SEEKING A JURIS DOCTOR DEGREE BUT ALSO HAS A MASTER OF LAWS PROGRAM A MASTER'S STUDIES IN LAW PROGRAM AND A MASTER OF SCIENCE HEALTH BALLS IN LAW PROGRAM. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I EXCUSE ME INTO MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I UC HASTINGS EMERALD- NINE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. I DON'T TUITION FOR FEES AND FEES FOR ITS JURIS DOCTOR PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE I WILL. BE FORTY SIX THOUSAND THIRTY THREE DOLLARS. THE BUDGET PROVIDES IT TO MILLION DOLLAR ON GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT- I'VE PATIENTS EXHIBITS FOR OPERATIONS BRINGING ITS TOTAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR AT TWO TWENTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU L. A. O. HOUSTON CONCENTRA SALLY- COMPARED TO THE UC BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- LEGISLATURE IN A BETTER POSITION TO REVIEW HASTINGS BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS. ONE IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASED INCREASE IS CONNECTED TO A BUDGET PLAN THAT HASTINGS DEVELOPED. BUDGET PLAN INCLUDES SIR BASIC WORKLOAD INCREASES LIKE SALARY INCREASES BENEFIT COST INCREASES THINGS ALSO PLANS TO HIRE US ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES AND REPLACE SOME RICH BY PLAY REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN IN ADDITION HASTINGS ANNUALLY PROVIDES A LEGISLATURE A MULTI YEAR PLAN THAT GIVES A LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE SENSE AS TO WHERE IT'S HEADING. THE NATIONAL AND IT'S NOT A CONTRACT SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO COMMIT TO TODAY. I'M SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- PROVIDES A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR HASTINGS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IT IS A STARTING POINT SO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REVIEW HASTINGS PLANS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR INSURANCE PLANS ALIGNED WITH ITS PRIORITIES. ONE OTHER POINT YOU JUST WANT TO QUICKLY EMPHASIZED TWO THINGS- IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING AN INITIATIVE TO CHANGE ITS NAME. THEN INTENT ALTERNATELY REQUIRES OF A BILL FROM THE LEGISLATURE. ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR OFFICE HASTINGS NOTED THAT THAT NAME CHANGE COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOME ONE TIME COSTS SUCH AS CHANGING BUILDING NAMES THOSE COSTS ARE NOT. INCLUDED IN HASTINGS EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT IT SUBMITTED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR EITHER THE REVISION. IN THE FUTURE BUDGET CYCLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. I THANK YOU ARE THE RUN SAM HARDY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DAVID HEY MAN- THE DEAN OF THE LAW SCHOOL AND I'M SORRY IF I GAVE THE SERVER THE COLLEGE'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER I'M GIPSON GRATEFUL- AND THANKFUL FOR THE LEGISLATORS. SUPPORT OF. PATIENTS OUT OF THE LAW. THE PROPOSAL BUDGET. IT WAS STRONG AND GROWING WITH THE WAY FOR IN TERMS OF PER AND- IN AN X. CLASS PAST FALL FROM AND- FACT.

OUR MARKET AND IT'S KICKING TO BE GOOD THE CLASS OF TWENTY POINT ONE HAS EVEN PER THREE. WITHIN THE FIRST TIME PASSWORD OF 80% WE HAVEN'T GOT IT CAN YOU YEAH DESPERATE TOPICS FOR STUDENTS OF THE PAST COUPLE OF THE GIRLS THIS THE PENDULUM A DAY WE HAVE THEM AUDIO. SO CAN WE HAVE MISTER SEA MAYBE TAKE OVER TO SEE IF HIS CONNECTION IS ANYBODY. THAT A GOOD MORNING FOLKS- DAVID SO HERE TO FINANCIAL OFFICER SO TO PICK WHERE A FAKE LEFT I DON'T OPEN I'M COMING THROUGH OKAY. I SEEM TO BE- THE ECO IS DOING VERY WELL- WE BENEFITTED FROM THE OF ACTED PRO. WE ARE EMBARKED UPON THE OF REBEL MEANT- IN ACADEMIC VILLAGE THAT WILL SUPPORT- STUDENTS FROM MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS- CURRENTLY OUR PRIMARY PARTNERS UCSF WE HAVE UC DAVIS STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AS WELL.
