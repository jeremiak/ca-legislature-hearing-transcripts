OR THE LARGEST EARTHQUAKE EVER RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA STRIKES IN SECTIONS OF HIGHWAY EIGHTY AND FIVE AIRPORT RUNWAYS HAVE BUCKLED OR HEAVEN FORBID ANOTHER MORE DEADLY WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC UNLIKELY SCENARIOS PERHAPS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE. NO CALIFORNIA THE STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT PROVISION IN OUR CONSTITUTION. SO WHEN WE ARE UNABLE TO SAFELY PHYSICALLY BE IN THE CAPITAL THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE HAS SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED POWER TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDERS WITH ZERO WARNING TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WHERE BY THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. HAVE VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT. WHILE WE WERE ON A HASTY KOBE DRIVEN EXTEND A RECESS THE GOVERNOR ISSUE THIRTY EXECUTIVE ORDERS. MOST OF WHICH I AGREE WITH AND I APPLAUD BUT VERY FEW OF THOSE ORDERS WITH WIDE RANGING POLICY IMPLICATIONS HAD ANY MEANINGFUL IMPACT. FROM THIS LAW MAKING BODY. AS WE'VE ALL LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THE WAY THEY WORK USING TECHNOLOGY IN A REMOTE FASHION TO KEEP BUSINESS MOVING. TWENTY STATES CURRENTLY RED AND BLUE STATES SO CALLED RED AND BLUE. ARE USING REMOTE VOTING THEY HAVE TAKEN THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF LEGISLATING REMOTELY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. ACA TWENTY FIVE STATES THAT IN AN EXTREMELY RARE CASE. WHERE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED BY THE GOVERNOR AND OR PRESIDENT. AND LEGISLATORS ARE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO BE SAFELY PRESENT IN THIS BUILDING. THIS LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE LEGISLATING A REMOTE WAY. IF AND ONLY IF. THE VOTE OF CALIFORNIA AUTHORIZED US TO DO SO. IF ALLOWED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT EACH HOUSE WAS FURTHER ADOPT RULES BY A TWO THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY VOTE. DETAILING THE PRECISE MEANS BY WHICH REMOTE OR PROXY LEGISLATING WOULD HAPPEN. WITH PUBLIC ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION BY THE PUBLIC AS A PARAMOUNT CONCERN. THERE'S BEEN DATED AND AN ACCURATE INFORMATION PUT FORTH BY OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL REGARDING PUBLIC ACCESS AND TRANSPARENCY. LET ME BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THERE IS NO RESTRICTION. ON PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR PROCEEDINGS IN EVERYTHING WE DO EVERYTHING WE WOULD DO AND STATE OF EMERGENCY THROUGH REMOTE MEANS. WOULD BE ALIGNED WITH ANY COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR. THE P.

I PARTISAN SUPPORT FOR ANYONE PRESS TWO TO MY JOIN OFF TO GLARE AT THE MINORITY. WHO UP OF WAS LEAD ARE BY. EFFORTS IN ROUNDING UP SUPPORT FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS LONG OVERDUE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN MISTER KING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I'M A PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF A CA TWENTY FIVE I THINK WE KNEW WHAT WOULD OCCUR WHEN WE WENT ON RECESS DUE TO THIS COVERT PANDEMIC. WHEN WE ENDED UP GOING HOME WORKING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WHAT I WITNESSED WAS ALL THE LOCAL AGENCIES WHO WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE TO LIBERATE THE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE ON BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE COMMUNICATORS BOARDS ARE SCHOOL BOARDS ARE WATER DISTRICTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD NO PROVISION TO BE ABLE TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US TODAY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO DO THE BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND MOVE THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT BYMOVING FOR LEAVING YOU ACTUALLY SAW IT INCREASING DISAPPEAR YORKSHIRE SOME MORE PEOPLE WILLING TO OF BE TO GIVE THEIR OPINION. IS NO LONGER YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK TO GO DOWN TO CITY HALL WELCOME TO THE CAPITAL AND- SIT FOR A FEW HOURS TO JUST GIVE A ONE OR TWO MINUTES COMMENT YOU COULD DO THAT LINE. YOU COULD. BEING GAY. STILL DO AT DOING AWAY AT HOME WERE STILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY HOME SO THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND DO OUR BUSINESS- DURING A PANDEMIC OR DURING ANY PARTICULAR EMERGENCY WHERE WE ARE UNABLE TO BE IN THIS BUILDING WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MISTER TANG MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES ARE VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. IT WAS PRESENTED LAST WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY RULES COMMITTEE THAT'S WHERE THE MAN WAS TAKEN TO REMOVE ANY CONFLICT WHATSOEVER PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR. AND I THINK THERE WAS A CONFUSION BY SOME FOLKS. RAISING QUESTIONS THINKING THAT BY THIS ACTION WE WOULD RE WRITE THE RULES WITHOUT PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT. SO COURSE THIS IS A PROPOSED CONSTITUTION MEMBER WILL GO ON THE BALLOT. AND THE PUBLIC WILL BE PERMITTED TO WAY AND ACTUALLY IT IS THEIR VIEW WHICH WILL BE DISPOSITIVE. OF THIS POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT I ACTUALLY THINK TWENTY TWENTY. IS EXCEPTIONAL TIME TO PUT A QUESTION LIKE THIS BEFORE CALIFORNIANS. I THINK THERE ARE THREE VERY LARGE FACTORS OF THE WAY INTO THEIR CONSIDERATION. THAT TWENTY TWENTY ACQUAINT SOME WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL WAY WE ALL KNOW THE CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGY. THAT EVERYONE IS USING TO A GREATER EXTENT BECAUSE OF COVERT. SO HAVE PERSONAL FAMILIARITY WITH HOW TECHNOLOGY EXTENDS YOUR REACH. EVEN IN TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE DISRUPTIONS ASSOCIATE COVE IN. NINETEEN WHICH WILL GIVE THEM AN IMMEDIATE FRAME OF REFERENCE ON THIS QUESTION. THAT TOO WILL BE A GREAT ADVANTAGES A COMES BEFORE THE VOTERS. AND THEN THE THIRD ELEMENT HONESTLY IS THE ELEMENT OF PROTEST CURRENTLY COURSE INTO AMERICAN LIFE. CALIFORNIA LIFE IT IS A REMINDER THAT PEOPLE DO WANT ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK THESE THREE ELEMENTS THE FAMILIARITY WITH TECHNOLOGY THE REALITY OF DISRUPTION IN THE PRECIOUSNESS OF OUR AMERICAN HERITAGE OF. OF SPEAKING TO THE GREAT ISSUES OF THE DAY WILL BE INTERTWINED IN THE VOTERS MINDS IS A REVIEW THIS THIS FALL I REGION I WILL. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY MISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ESTABLISH REMOTE AND PROXY VOTING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA AND IT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE CURRENT STATUS OF REPRESENTATION GEN IN OUR STATE. BECAUSE BY ANY MEASURE CALIFORNIA HAS THE LEAST REPRESENTATIVE LEGISLATURE IN THE COUNTRY EACH OF US IN THIS CHAMBER REPRESENTS CLOSE TO A HALF MILLION PEOPLE ALL COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE REPRESENT CLOSE TO A MILLION PEOPLE THAT SEVERAL TIMES MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. IN THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY THAT BUT EVERY YEAR THIS ASSEMBLY TAKES CONTRA STEPS TO LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS AND TO BECOME LESS TRANSPARENT BY LEGISLATING POLICY MORE THE BUDGET PROCESS BY CRAMMING MORE BILLS INTO A SHORTER WINDOW FOR COMMITTEE HEARINGS BY IGNORING PROP FIFTY FOUR TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS AND PERHAPS MOST EGREGIOUSLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT TERM. GETTING RID OF CHOIR THE BILL EVEN UP TO BE HURT VOTED ON IT DID YOU CAN COMMITTEE CHAIRS THE POWER TO SPIKE LEGISLATION WITHOUT A HEARING WITHOUT ABOUT WITHOUT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. NOW IN SPITE OF ALL OF THAT. THE WHAT THERE'S ONE THING THAT KEEPS THIS A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN MORE THAN JUST A NAME AND THAT IS THE SINGLE UNASSAILABLE. YOU WOULD THINK IN ALL FOR A BALL FACT OF US AS REPRESENTATIVES WALKING INTO THIS ROOM SITTING AT THESE DESKSPUTTING ALL OUR FINGERS ON THE BUTTON AND PUTTING OUR VOTES ON THAT BOARD FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE WHOLE WORLD. SEE AND IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A STATUTE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT HAS TO COME THROUGH THIS ROOM AND RECEIVE THE AFFIRMATION OF THE PUBLIC'S DELEGATES OF THE PUBLIC DELEGATES THAT IS THE BASIC ARCHITECTURE OF DEMOCRACY. AND THIS LEGISLATION PUTS A CRACK IN. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT REMOTE VOTING. WOULD NEVER BE WARRANTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF WE'RE GONNA PUT A CRACK IN THE INSTITUTION OF REPRESENTATION WE BETTER HAVE SAFEGUARDS AND REINFORCEMENT THAT IS IRON CLAD SO IT DOESN'T DESTABILIZE THE INSTITUTION ITSELF OR EVEN BECAUSE THE WHOLE EDIFICE TO CRUMBLE BUT THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS. CREATES THOSE VERY RISKS THE DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY IS TOO BROAD IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE OFFICIALS IN OFFICIAL STATEWIDE EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE GOVERNOR IS LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ASSEMBLY IT ALLOWS FOR NOT JUST REMOTE VOTING BUT PROXY VOTING WHERE YOU CAN JUST HAND YOUR VOTER VOTING BUTTON OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE AND- SEVERS THE TIED TO THE ACTUAL REPRESENTATIVE- IN THE MOBILE DEVELOPING. AND DIED AT ANY OTHER PREVENT WE ATE SWAYED BROAD OF A MAN I TO INVOKE THIS THEN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE INDEED THERE'S EVEN ONE PROVISION THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WOULD ALLOW THE MEMBERS OF THE AND TO UP ITS MEMBER UNDER. BILL SERVE WHICH I THINK IS A TROUBLING PRECEDENT THIS IS GOING TO GET A STATE WHERE I COULD SUPPORT IT IT WOULD NEED TO BE NOT MUCH NARROWER AND WE NEED MEAN TO ME THREE REQUIREMENTS. OF ALL THE STATE OF THE WITH BE TO BE THE FIVE TWO COULD ONLY THOSE RIBBONS THE LEAD. SIMPLY ME. EXACTLY THERE WERE TO BE A AYE A BETTER PROCESS. FOR GETTING. ACTUALLY HOW'RE VOTING WOULD WORK SAID THE WE'RE GONNA NOT HAVE PROXY VOTING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SHOULD ONLY BE LIMITED TO REMOTE VOTING. AND THERE WOULD BE A MUCH CLEARER PROCESS ABOUT HOW EXACTLY YOU GO ABOUT BRINGING THESE CONDITIONS I TO A- AND BRINGING THEM TO AN END AND THEN FINALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE RECONVENES. TO EITHER RATIFIED OR REVERSE WHAT HAPPENED- WELL THE REMOTE VOTING OCCURRED. I'LL MAKE ONE FINAL POINT. AND THAT'S THAT I COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH WHAT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL SAID REGARDING THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE JUST HAD. DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. WHILE WE WERE AWAY OUR STATE GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE INTO ONE PERSON RULE WITH THE GOVERNOR ISSUING AT THIS POINT FORTY ONE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. CHANGING OVER TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA LAWS WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN AND THE ARGUMENT AS WELL IF WE HAD REMOTE VOTING THEN MAYBE WE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ACTIVELY IN THE EIGHTIES WE COULD HAVE BEEN AN EQUAL PARTNER. IN GETTING OUR STATE THROUGH THIS CRISIS. WHAT IS THE ISSUE. WE'RE BACK NOW. WE'RE HERE WE'RE IN SESSION. AND YET THE GUY IS STILL ADDED. ISSUING EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT YOU SERVE OUR LARGEST. ONE SECOND. REMOTE VOTING. IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR POLITICAL WILL IT'S NOT A SUBSTITUTE. FOR LEADERSHIP. SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WOULD CALL ON ALL OF US. TO LEAD THE WAY IN BRINGING THE LEGISLATURE BACK TO BEING A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF MR STONE TO DISAPPOINT ORDER I'M SORRY. OKAY I NAY A POINT OF ORDER THIS HOUSE HAS A FIVE MINUTE SPEECH LIMIT THAT SPEECH IS GONNA QUITE A BIT LONGER I WAS. HOPING TO ASK. THE PRESIDING OFFICER TO ASK MR KILEY TO WRAP UP. THANK YOU MISTER S. DOWN HOWEVER HE DID HAVE FIFTEEN MORE SECONDS. ON THE CLOCK WE DO HAVE A TIMER APPEAR- SO I JUST JAN THIRTY SECONDS WERE YOU DONE MR KIND OF CHECK. OKAY THANK YOU. AN MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER WANTED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS SURE A FEW THOUGHTS FIRST WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE- FOR BRING FOR THIS THOUGHTFUL MEASURE HE'S BEEN A REAL LEADER ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES AND A REAL ASSET IN CREDIT TO OUR BODIES SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR OF YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE AND- RISES A PROUD POST SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A FEW POINTS ONE I THINK IS A POINT TO MAKE FOR THE RECORD WHICH IS THAT- I IT'S MY OPINION I THINK OPINION OF A LOT OF FOLKS OF LOOK AT THE ISSUE THAT REMOTE LEGISLATING IS CURRENTLY CONSTITUTIONAL I THINK THAT'S CLEAR FROM THE LANGUAGE OF ARTICLES THREE AND FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. IT'S CLEAR FROM THE OPINION OF A LOT OF OUTSIDE EXPERTS INCLUDING THE CONSTITUTION CENTER UC BERKELEY THAT IS LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE A LOT OF THE LAWYERS IN OUR HOUSE TO LOOK AT THIS THE CHAIR OF OUR JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THE CHAIR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE THE ASSISTANT MAJORITY LEADER OUR SYSTEM TOM OTHERS HAVE EXAMINE THIS ISSUE AND I THINK I'VE TAKEN THE OPINION I THINK RIGHTFULLY SO IT'S CONSISTENT ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS OF CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. THAT WE WANT TO TOMORROW TO WE FROM NOW ON NOW MEET REMOTELY AND REMOTE THE TOP PERMISSIBLE OUR CONSTITUTION NOT IS SAID I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY PER TAKE MEASURE TO CLARIFY WHAT THE SHOULD PROVIDE SOME GABRIELLE'S IN CYBER. EYES IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND I THINK IT'S A MUCH INAPPROPRIATE. I ALSO WANT REALLY A STATE MY CELL WITH THE COMMENTS OF OUR CALL. FROM SAN. I THINK THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED RECENTLY. HAS REALLY EXPANDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I THINK IT'S BROUGHT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS AND I THINK IT'S- SOMEWHAT TELLING WITH WITH AND I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS ARE THE PAID. PROFESSIONAL LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO. BECAUSE WHAT THEY ENJOY UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS A NEAR MONPOLY ON THE ABILITY TO COME TESTIFYING COMMITTEE. AND OURS ARE CALLING FROM SAN FRANCISCO NOTED. IT' PRETTY HARD FOR YOUR- CAL. THEY DON'T LIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE IT UP HERE AT ELEVEN A. I'M ON A WEDNESDAY TO COME TESTIFY ON AN ISSUE OF BROAD PUBLIC IMPORTANCE. BUT WHAT ALL OF US HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS IS THAT BY USING TECHNOLOGY. PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE CAN CALL IN AND HAVE THEIR OPINIONS HEARD AND CAN BE PART OF THE PROCESS SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A REALLY STRONG ARGUMENT. AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MADE VERY CLEARLY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S GOING TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IT'S GOING TO START TO PUT YOUR AVERAGE CITIZEN ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH PAID LOBBYISTS UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I THINK IT'S A REALLY WISE AND PRUDENT AND MEASURE I DON'T REALLY ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT IT. YOU MISTER GABRIEL MISTER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE CULMINATING CRISIS HAS SHOWN US THAT OUR GOVERNMENT MUST BE ABLE TO RAPIDLY ADJUST TO EVER EVOLVING CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. HOWEVER OUR ABILITY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS FOR IMMEDIATE RESPONSES FOR THE MITIGATION OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS WAS LIMITED BECAUSE IT WAS UNSAFE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONVENE. I BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF A CA TWENTY FIVE IS TO ALLOW FOR US AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO CONTINUE OUR WORK IN REAL TIME DURING A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU AVE DONE AND- THIS I BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE MATTER AND I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY HOWEVER. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE STRIKE THE BALANCE OF SAFEGUARDING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THE RIGHTS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WHILE WE DO OUR LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON MISTER LIVING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. ASSERTING BRANCHES CO EQUAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT BUT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS TRULY ABOUT CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE'S GOVERNANCE. WE HAVE A DEADLINE STARING DOWN BEFORE US- THAT WERE RACING TOWARD WHICH IS PASSING THE STATE BUDGET. AND WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT PASS THE STATE BUDGET WE CANNOT FIND CRITICAL HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES PUBLIC EDUCATION WITH OUT. THE LEGISLATURE MEETING AND PASSING THAT BUDGET AND THIS MEASURE HELPS MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEVIN MISTER BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MIL I'M NOT A SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE- IN SUPPORT OF A CA. TWENTY FIVE TO A MEMBER- EVERY WOMAN AND MAN IN THIS ROOM I THINK WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED BY THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE FELT. WHEN WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COME TO SACRAMENTO AND DO OUR JOBS AND A LOT OF US TALK TO EACH OTHER WE TAXES EACH OTHER WE CALLED EACH OTHER WE DISCUSSED IN CAUCUS SOME OF US TWEETED OUR ANGER AT THE GOVERNOR AND CONTINUE TO TWEET OUR ANGER AT THE GOVERNOR. ON A DAILY BASIS- AND I THINK THERE'S UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT AT THE FRUSTRATION AND WHAT WE CAN ROMANTICIZE. ABOUT WALKING INTO A PHYSICAL LOCATION AND DOING OUR JOB IN THAT FIELD PHYSICAL LOCATION. SOMETIMES OUR ROMANTIC IDEALS RUN INTO THE HARSH REALITIES OF TODAY- AND TODAY. THAT WE HAD A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EARTHQUAKES- THERE ON TOLD- UNANTICIPATED EMERGENCIES THAT COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN'T PHYSICALLY WALK ONTO A GREEN CARPET AND PUSH A PHYSICAL BUTTON TO REPRESENT OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT IT'S DURING THOSE TIMES THAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DO OUR JOB. IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE THE CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE- AND THAT IS WHAT A CA TWENTY FIVE IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATTEO. FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THIS ISSUE FOR WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE GETTING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE- WE CAN TWEETS WE CAN RAGE WE CAN YELL BUT AT SOME. TIME WE HAVE TO DO THE RESPONSIBLE THING AND SUPPORTING A CA TWENTY FIVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE THING ON CAR DRIVER. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN MISS RIVAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A CA TWENTY FIVE I THINK GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF AMENDING OUR CONSTITUTION IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS AND WE LEARNED DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA DOES THE SAME. ALSO BY GOING THROUGH- A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IT MAKE SURE THAT THE DEBATE OF WHETHER REMOTE LEGISLATING IS ALREADY IN THE CONSTITUTION OR NOT- IT WILL DEFINITELY CLEAR THAT UP AND I THINK ALL OF US WILL FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT WE THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I'M CONFIDENT TO THAT THE AUTHOR AND ALL OF US WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE. AND SO I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS RIVAS MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS- I A PRE I DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL. THAT I THINK. MADE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT- BETTER BUT I THINK FOR ME THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS IF THE ISSUE IS REMOTE VOTING. AND ALLOWING US TO REMOTE VOTE IN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THAT IS ALL THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SHOULD BE ABOUT. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE OTHER THINGS IN THERE LIKE ORIGINALLY. OUT PUTTING AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY OF THE PUBLIC BEING ABLE TO REDRESS AND PETITION THEIR GOVERNMENT. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE AS IT DOES NOW AS IT STILL DOES- PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FOR- SOME OTHER BODY TO FILL. SEATS US IF THERE WERE SOME SORT OF DESTRUCTIVE THING TO HAPPEN AND WE LOST MANY MEMBERS OF THIS CHAMBER. I DON'T THINK THAT ANYBODY ELSE SHOULD FILL THAT SEAT OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT THE DOT SEAT REPRESENTS. THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT THIS BILL THERE'S THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR PROXY VOTING AND I'M SORRY BUT EACH AND EVRY PERSON IN THIS ROOM IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS ONE REASON YOU AND ONLY YOU. CAN REPRESENT. YOUR CONSTITUENTS. YOU AND ONLY YOU. HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH THAT VOTE TO VOTE ON BEHALF OF THEM AND IF WE ALLOW PROXY VOTING WEIRS WE ARE TAKING AWAY FROM THAT FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND ALLOWING SOMEONE ELSE TO VOTE IN THAT SEE WHICH IS NOT WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS INTENDED SO IF THE ISSUE IS ABOUT REMOTE VOTING THEN LET'S JUST MAKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SIMPLY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I AGREE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET. DURING THIS EMERGENCY WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO REMOTE IN WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO IT I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER FROM FROM THE GREAT SAN FERNANDO VALLEY- THAT ALREADY CONSTITUTIONALLY WE PROBABLY HAVE THAT ABILITY. TO DO THAT- AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN LET'S JUST DO THAT. RIGHT BUT ADDING IN THESE OTHER THINGS ALLOWING SEATS TO BE FILLED BY SOMEONE WHO'S NOT. THE PEOPLE. WHO THAT SEAT IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT. AND STILL LEAVING IN THEIR PROXY VOTING WHICH ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO VOTE ON BEHALF OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEY DID NOT ELECT REPRESENT THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME AND IF WE CHANGE THAT IN THEIR HOUSE TO ME THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD DISCUSSION AMONGST MANY PEOPLE. BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A FULL OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE THE PUBLIC WEIGH IN ON THIS AND HAVE DELIBERATION AND I THINK YOU NEED TO DO THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SIGNIFICANT. CHANGES SO. THAT IS WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. AS IT SITS HERE TODAY AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE THINKING ABOUT THOSE. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. AND I WILL AGREE WITH MY REPRESENTATIVE FROM ROCKLAND. MY COLLEAGUE FROM ROCKLAND THEY IT ONLY MATTERS OF THIS CHAMBER ACTUALLY STEPS UP AND CHALLENGES THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE TAKES OVER OUR LEGISLATIVE ROLE AND HE HAS DONE THAT MANY TIMES DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE'VE DONE VIRTUALLY NOTHING. WE DON'T LITTLE BIT COMPLAINED ABOUT IT. WE DONE VIRTUALLY NOTHING TO TAKE BACK LEGISLATIVE POWER THAT HE IS A SERB FROM US WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS. WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IT REMOTELY. OR WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IN THIS CHAMBER AT SOME POINT THIS BODIES GOT A STEP UP AND SAY THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE HOUSE THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS ARE OURS ALONE. AND NOT THE GOVERNOR'S AND UNLESS SOMEONE IS WILLING TO DO THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE- VOTING REMOTELY ARE NOT. IT'S THE WILL OF US TO PROTECT THAT SO DON'T. PUT THIS IS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN. ASSERT OUR POWER WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW TODAY. AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE AS JOIN AUTHOR OF A CA TWENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD ENSURE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. AS THE COLD WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR OUR LEGISLATIVE WORK DOES NOT STOP SIMPLY BECAUSE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVENT US FROM BEING PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE CAPITAL IN FACT IN TIMES OF DISASTER OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED REPRESENTATION MORE THAN EVER AND WE SAW THAT SIMPLY HANDING CONTROL OUR STATE OVER TO THE GOVERNOR IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WE CAN HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. AND IT'S GLARING FAILURE THAT IS A STATE THAT LEADS THE WORLD IN TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION WE IN STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE FALLEN SO WOEFULLY BEHIND THE TIMES ACA TWENTY FIVE WOULD HELP BRING US INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WHAT THE WORK CONTINUES REGARDLESS OF OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEARER THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE WILL PRESERVE TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THIS IS A CA DOES NOT PREVENT. OR PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS GRANTED TO CALIFORNIANS BY PROP FIFTY FOUR IN ANY WAY. NOTHING IN THIS ACA PREVENTS ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FROM CONTACTING THEIR LEGISLATORS OR FOR FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS JUST AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING IN FACT IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER. NOTHING IN THIS A CA ALLOWS LEGISLATORS TO VOTE OR GOVERNMENT IN SECRET. IN FACT THE AUTHOR OF PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR SAID THAT RECENT AMENDMENTS ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. FURTHER THE ABILITY TO VOTE REMOTELY IS GRANTED ONLY TO THOSE LEGISLATORS WHO CANNOT SAFELY GET TO THE CAPITAL DUE TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY A DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT BECAUSE TO ALLOW REMOTE VOTING UNDER A CA TWENTY FIVE. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. THIS MEASURE WILL GO TO THE VOTERS VOTERS WILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY BOTH HOUSES MUST THEN ADOPT IMPLEMENTING RULES TO SPECIFICALLY DEFINE THE RARE INSTANCES WHEN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MEASURE MAY BE INVOKED. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS NEVER LOSE THEIR RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION EVEN IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY OR DISASTER I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL HAVE MANY CONCERNS. OVER THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR OF THIS HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WITH THE GOVERNOR ROLLING VIA EXECUTIVE ORDER AND US FINDING OUT WHAT HE'S DOING. ON THE NEWS OR HIS FACEBOOK OR HOWEVER YOU ALL COTTAGE. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I FEEL THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME PROVISIONS IN THIS. THAT NEED WORK. I FEEL THAT THE PROXY SITUATION IS AN ISSUE. AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS THIS MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE THE AUTHOR WILL ADDRESS THESE THINGS AND TAKE SOME MORE AMENDMENTS. TO CLEAN THIS UP TO REALLY TRULY INSURER. THAT THE VOTERS ARE GETTING THE VOICE THAT THEY VOTED FOR. AND THAT THAT POWER REMAINS WITH THEM. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS THOSE- POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE AND HIS CLOSE. I THINK THAT- REMOVING THE PROXIES WOULD MAKE THIS MUCH MORE PALATABLE- X. SPECIALLY FOR THE VOTERS AS THIS GOES FORWARD BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY. GOES THROUGH THE ELECTION PROCESS. TO SAY OH YEAH SOMETHING HAPPENED WERE IN ANOTHER PANDEMIC OR AN EARTHQUAKE OR WHATEVER. TO HAVE THE PERSON THEY VOTED FOR NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE THERE AND THEN THAT PERSON BE APPOINTED BY SOMEBODY ELSE I THINK THAT EEDS CLARIFICATION. AND HONEST TO GOD HOPE THAT THAT CHANGES SO WHEN THIS BILL DOES COME BACK ON CONCURRENCE FROM THE SENATE. WE WILL SEE THOSE CHANGES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS NETWORKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATTEO FOR PUTTING FORTH THIS IMPORTANT ACA. I AM STANDING HERE THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO AS A PREGNANT LADY WITH A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY. WHO IS HERE TODAY IN THIS ROOM WITH ALL THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE HOPEFULLY NONE OF YOU HAVE CURRENT VIRUS. AND TAKING THE RISK TO BE HERE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE ENFRANCHISED IN MY CONSTITUENCY BE A FRANCHISE. AND I NEED TO VOTE ON THESE BILLS. BUT THAT IS A TOUGH CHOICE TO MAKE. WE ARE WHEN YOUR HEALTH. OR YOUR JOB WHICH WE ALL TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND IF WE HAD TO SAY CA PASSED RIGHT NOW ON OF THE VOTERS APPROVE IT. WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES. AND SO IT ASKS THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS TODAY SO WE CAN GO TO THE BALLOT SO OUR- OUR LECTURED. CAN HELP MAKE THIS DECISION FOR US. BECAUSE OF THESE RARE MOMENTS OF TIME WE HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE NEED ANOTHER TOOL AND ART AND ART IN THE TOOLBOX. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS VERY VERY CRITICAL. TO ENSURE EVEN MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND TO ENSURE FUNDAMENTALLY THAT OUR PEOPLE IN FRANCHISE BECAUSE THAT IS THE AND THE ESSENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WICKS% SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER MIND YOU MAKE US.

THE ACTUAL METHODS AND HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN THAT UNFORESEEABLE EVENT- THAT WILL BE DEBATED ON THIS FLOOR SO. I'VE EVER JUST VERY BRIEFLY I KNOW SAID A LONG DEBATE AND I STAND IN THE WAY OF- A LUNCH BREAK I BELIEVE LET ME BE BRIEF AND JUST SIMPLY SAY THAT SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT- I WAS A VOICE FOR KEEPING THE OLD THE ORIGINAL CAL CHANNEL.

NOT A TAXES AND TAXES IN THE AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE NOW I KNOW THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE TAKING SOME INVENTS. OUR FIVE THIS IS NOT AND THE TO BE A TWO. FOR FISHING EXPEDITIONS OR HARASSMENT IN FACT WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE PROVISION THAT ALLOWS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY. ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE CITY TO. A CASE FOR THIS BILL WILL. WAY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WHO USE OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND DON'T HAVE INSIDE. BRING THESE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE IT OF. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BILL SECONDLY THEY CONCERNED THAT PRIVATE ATTORNEYS ON BEHALF OF THE KEY TO HAVE THE WHISTLE BLOWER THE KEY TELL PLAINTIFF WOULD BE. THE MAY COMPANY WHERE I'M GONNA TAKE AN AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON OPPOSITION. DEMANDS ARE OF THIS REQUEST TO INSURE THAT IF AN ATTORNEY DOES THAT. LETTER THAT TOURNEY WOULD FROM BRINGING THAT CASE SO THIS IS NOT COOL TO FISHING OR GO HOME. THIS IS BUT IT WE SHOULD TO GO OKAY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UP FOR MORE IN TAX. AND IT TENDS ONLY WILL. NOT PAID THEM. THAT'S THE SCOPE IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN NEW YORK NEW YORK AS PRIDE IN. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE LAST TEN YEARS IN UNPAID TAXES WE HAVE A TAX CAP IN CALIFORNIA OF TOOL HE BILL. MOYERS NOW THIS. THAT OTHER. YEAH BRING IT TO THE STATE AND LOCAL JR HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF AGAIN INTENTIONALLY WITHHELD TAXES SO THIS IS THIS IS A BILL THAT GOES AFTER THOSE SCOFFLAWS THIS GOES AFTER TAX EVADERS THIS TO GO OUT FOLKS WHO HAVE THIS. THING AGENCY THOSE ARE PROHIBITED IT IS ONLY FEE OF WILLFULLY AND INTO SELECT WITH HELD THEIR AXES IS. BORN AT THE- IS A BY THE GENERAL WHO. OF THE U. THE THOUGHT. UNDER THE WHISTLE BLOWERS THAT TO AFTER TAX STUFF LAWS AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISS STONE MISTER O'CONNOR TO YOU ARE IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE AND I. TO AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBERS BY. TO REDUCE TAX CAPITAL. THIS BILL GOES ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BUT ULTIMATELY VERY DESTRUCTIVE. THIS BILL. GET PRIVATE. TO IN CALIFORNIA REVENUE. LAW IT CREATES A- OF FOR THESE ATTORNEYS BRING NUISANCE LAWSUITS AGAINST TAXPAYERS AND YOU WANT TO GO TO. OF HOW THIS PROCESS HAS RUN AMOK IN THE PAST LOOK AT THE- PLEASE AT WHICH IS A NOT EVERY DAY SUPPORTS. DOES OF LAWSUITS AND ALLOW SIXTY OF BILLS AND ALL SIX YEAR A TO FOR TO BE WITHIN THAT'S SYSTEM WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF A CITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE SAME. ASSET AS A MORE. WHERE SINGLE PAYER. BUSINESSES IN. WHY OF THEM ALL UP. THAT THE TOY. SEAT TO A ARE HAPPENING TOO CLOSE TO THE WALL. SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THE- THAT THAT THIS OF BILL WOULD ENABLE YEAH IF YOU DON'T GO. THAT THAT WHAT HAPPENED HE AND CAL LOOK NO FURTHER THAN OTHER STATES THAT. MEDI ANGEL. BY JUST ONE BERNIE FILED HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS IN WHICH HE WENT ONLINE WHAT. THE PRODUCTS AND THEN USE THAT AS JUSTIFICATION TO FIRE. HOW TO STICK A. HELLO IN VIOLATION AND STATE CODE I WILL HAVE. IF WE PASS THIS TODAY AYE URGENT VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL TEAS SEEING NO FURTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MR SO YOU MAKERS I THANK YOU I'M I'M ACTUALLY GLAD THAT CALLING FROM BIG BEAR BROUGHT UP THOSE ISSUES. AS THAT SLOWLY. REMOTE UNDER THE CLAIMS ACT WHICH MEANS THERE NEEDS TO BE A WHISTLEBLOWER AND THAT WAS A BLOWER NEEDS TO COME FORWARD TO A TAXING ENTITY OR TO. THE B. S. THAT WILL HAVE TO THE TAX IS. MAKE CLAIM THINK OF THE GENERAL IN THIS CASE. WHERE PRINT ATTORNEYS FROM UNDER THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN THE SENATE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET THOSE DONE UNDER A SHORTENED ABBREVIATED SCHEDULE WE'RE PROHIBITING IT IS SENDING OUT THOSE LETTERS AS HAD HAVE TO THE EIGHTY. BUT ROOM THERE'S A BRUSH. HI DOLLARS WILL FULLY TAP. SO THOSE FISHING UP BUT IF WON'T HAPPEN BE WERE FOR THEM WE HAVE TAKEN OUT THE SECTION AND THIS WAS THE OTHER OPPOSITION THAT BECAUSE WE HAD ALLOWED CITIES WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A CITY TURNING ON STAFF THEY YOU CONTRACT OUT BERNIE'S IN RECOGNIZE THAT WE TOOK THAT PROVIDE YOU NOW BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT THAT WAS DRIVE IN PRIVATE IS RAISING THE- GOING AT. THAT WOULD TRUE. UNDERSTOOD THE CAN. SO WE TOOK THAT PROVISION THAT THE EIGHTY A LAWSUIT IN FACT WE HAVE THAT PROVISION THAT BARS ATTORNEYS FROM FILING THOSE CLAIMS AGAINST BUSINESSES THAT WORKS UNDER STATE LAW RIGHT THE PROBLEM IS FEDERAL LAW DOES. SAME OPPONENT BUT UNDERSTOOD. THE EIGHTY. HOWEVER DROPPED OUT OUR HAPPENING THERE IF THAT LAW THAT WE HAVE THE PHONE JURISDICTIONS THE SAME CHANGES WE DID THEN THOSE WOULDN'T HAPPEN THERE EITHER SO WE HAVE AFFECTED WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM UNDER THE EIGHTY WHICH IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THANK IN THAT MECHANISM SPARE. SO DON'T GET THE FISHING EXPEDITIONS AT GRASS BUSINESS. HOURS WILL. IN TAX WITH CHEATING THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ESPECIALLY IN A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN WE NEED AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL THE REVENUE WE CAN GET SO THE OPPOSITION ARE NOT. ALI BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TAKING AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH OPPOSITE. THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL CAN BE PROPERLY MANAGED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.

THEY ACTUALLY PUT DEMANDS ON TENANTS BEFORE THEY WILL INSPECT FOR ON SAFE AND IT ON AVAILABLE CONDITIONS IN APARTMENTS. THEY WERE CAUGHT. UP ON THEIR RENT THEY REQUIRE THAT THEY FIRST NOTIFY THE LANDLORD. AND TRY TO CORRECT TO THE LANDLORD EVEN IF THOSE TENANTS HAVE REASONS TO FEAR EVICTION OR BEING REPORTED TO ICE OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH PUTS A BUG AS YOU CAN TELL HUGE BARRIER SOMETIMES TO REPORTING THESE UNSAFE CONDITIONS. BUT NONE OF THAT SHOULD MATTER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AN APARTMENT IS EITHER SEEK TO LIVE IN OR IT'S NOT AND IT'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INSPECT FOR UNSAFE CONDITIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE REMEDY BY PROPERTY OWNERS. AB THIRTY THREE FIFTY TWO SIMPLY PROHIBITS LOCAL COLD ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA FROM PLACING THOSE KINDS OF RESTRICTIONS IN PRE CONDITIONS BEFORE RESPONDING TO PROBABILITY COMPLAINTS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE AGENCY PROVIDE COPIES OF THE INSPECTION REPORT AND ANY CITATIONS TO THE TECH ANOTHER DOCUMENTS OF THE BUILDINGS WHO MIGHT BE AFFECTED. SO THAT THEY KNOW THE CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN. OUT I PROVIDING A- WORK EIGHT THREE WHO DOES NOT READ ANY NEW DO A RESPONSE ON THE GOVERNMENTS I DO NOT EXPECTED INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS MADE ONLY HOPE.

IT DIVERT IT DIVERTS OVER IT IS DIVERTED OVER ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT EACH YEAR FOR WOMEN AND BLACK AND BROWN OWN BUSINESSES. UNRAVELING THE YEARS OF GROWTH AND ADVANCEMENT FOR THAT FOR THESE ENTREPRENEURS. THE BAN ON RACE CONSCIOUS AND GENDER CONSCIOUS REMEDIES DO NOT ALLOW FOR US TO DEAL WITH THE ROOT CAUSES OF SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND IT PREVENTS US FROM DESIGNING EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. TO CORRECT A ONGOING HISTORY OF BIAS AND EXCLUSION. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S OUT OF STEP WITH FORTY TWO OF THE STATE'S BEING ONLY ONE IN EIGHT STATES WITH THIS BAND. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. I DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE IN ACT TOWARD RACIAL AND GENDER EQUALITY. THE REMOVAL TOOL NINE WOULD NOT BURDEN YOU BECAUSE IT IT IS PERMISSIVE AND NOT PRESCRIPTIVE. AND DOES NOT MANDATE ANYTHING. WHAT THE LEADERS WHO WANT TO HELP REMEDY GENDER BIAS AND DISPARITIES. PROPOSITION TWO HAD NINE IS ALL HAS ONLY SERVED AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO ACT ON BEST PRACTICES ALIGNED WITH THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. ACA FIVE WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO RE VISIT AND EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. BOTH THE NEW GENERATION WHO ARE CALLING FOR CHANGE AND THOSE WHO RECALL THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR BEFORE AND AFTER PROP TWO NINE WOULD WAS IN EFFECT. ACA IS A PRIORITY BILL OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS ISN'T BOARD BACK DOORS BY THE JEWISH CAUCUS IN THE LGBT CAUCUS AND PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS. IT IS IT IS SPONSORED TODAY BY OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORT. MEMBERS WITH THE WORLD WATCHED IN MINNEAPOLIS THE SYMPTOMS OF A MUCH LARGER PROBLEM. AND THAT WAS EQUALLY DISTURBED AS US OFFICE WHO HAD HIS KNEE ON ON GEORGE FLOOR FLOOR ITS NECK. WAS OFFICER WHO STE AND AS WELL AS THE OFFICE WHO STOOD BY AND WERE COMPLICIT AND ALLOWED IT TO HAPPEN. EVEN BLOCKING STAND BUYERS FROM HELPING. TODAY I ASK THIS LEGISLATURE. I HOPE IT IS LEGISLATURE WOULD NO LONGER BE COMPLICIT IN THE STATUS QUO. THAT WILL NOT IDLY SIT BACK AND REST IN GENDER WITH GENDER AND RACIAL INEQUALITY. AND FURTHER THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WE WOULD BE WE WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA VOTERS. TO MAY HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD ABOUT THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY THE UNJUST AND UNFAIR SYSTEM AT AND WHETHER NOT THEY WANT TO UPHOLD PROPOSITION TOOL NINE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A CA FIVE. FIGURED WEBER THIS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE. CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENTS IT'S A BEACON OF HOPE AND NEW BEGINNINGS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT TO DIVERSE CITY. WITHOUT OUR DIVERSITY WE CANNOT CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MINORITY GROUPS FACE DISCRIMINATION AND DISPARITIES STEMMING FROM INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST BY THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC WITH BOTH THE ECONOMIC AND HEALTH IMPACTS. AS THESE COMMUNITIES MOURN HIGHER RATES OF KOBE INFECTIONS AND DEATHS THEY ALSO HAVE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY NAVIGATE HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT HAVE AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD. BY ALLOWING CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO REMOVE THE BAN ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND ALLOW DENTRE GENDER RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY TO BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. IF WE DO THAT WE WORK TOWARDS EQUITY. EQUITY IS NOT GIVING EVERYBODY THE SAME RESOURCES IT IS GIVING EACH PERSON THE APPROPRIATERESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED. EQUITY IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT NO ONE GROUP HAS A HIGHER RATE OF POVERTY. AND OTHER NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. UNTIL WE ACHIEVE EQUITY WE CANNOT TRULY CELEBRATE THE MANY FACES THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONAL FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES IS GOOD SALAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY AS THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF REPEALING PROP TWO OH NINE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTIVE AND OUR DESIRE TO HAVE THIS PROPOSITION REPEALS AND THE REASON IS QUITE SIMPLE IF YOU LOOK AROUND OUR CAUCUS WE KNEW THAT A VAST MAJORITY EXCEPT FOR THERE ARE VERY YOUNG ENDS. WE ALL BENEFITED FROM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WE KNEW THAT. IN FACT EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR WHO IS A WOMAN. A PERSON OF COLOR A NATIVE AMERICAN AND LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN OF FILIPINO. IN IS OVER THE AGE OF FORTY. BENEFITTED FROM THIS PROGRAM WEATHER WAS YOUR OWN PERSONAL STORY LIKE MINE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND STANFORD UNIVERSITY I WAS JUST SOMEBODY WHO HAD NEVER SET FOOT ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS COMING FROM A FAMILY WHO HAD NEVER DREAMED. THAT THEIR CHILDREN COULD GO ON TO A SCHOOL LIKE THAT. AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SECOND LOOK BECAUSE DIVERSITY MATTERED. BECAUSE MY STORY MATTER TO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICER I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND STANFORD TO GO ON TO PROVE MYSELF AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AND EVENTUALLY. GOING TO A FULL RIDE SCHOLARSHIP AT UCLA LAW SCHOOL. WHEN I WAS AT THAT SCHOOL LAW SCHOOL AT MY FIRST YEAR. THEY REPEAL PROP TWO OH NINE AND I ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED. TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF LOS STUDENTS TO NEXT YEAR OF OS STUDENTS. AND WE SAW A CLASS GO FROM BEING INCREDIBLY DIVERSE. COMPLETELY QUALIFIED. REALLY ROBUST IN OUR DISCUSSIONS TO ONE THAT LACKED ALMOST A SINGLE BLACK OR LATINO STUDENT. IT WAS DEVASTATING NOT JUST TO THE STUDENTS WHO MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT DEVASTATING TO THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. SYSTEMATIC RACISM DIDN'T STOP BECAUSE OF TWO OH NINE. PEOPLE DON'T STOP BEING. PREJUDICED THEY DIDN'T STOP TREATING CHILDREN DIFFERENTLY WHO CAME FROM OFTEN POOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. TEACHERS DIDN'T FAMILY THINK THAT YOU HAD THE SAME ABILITIES AS MAYBE YOUR UPPER MIDDLE CLASS WHITE SCHOOL MATE YOU CAN CERTAINLY GET EXPECTED TO GO INTO HONORS CLASSES INTO YOUR BEST BECAUSE PROP TO AND I WAS PULLED BACK. WE CAN'T CREATE COLOR BLINDNESS. IT DOESN'T EXIST. AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THESE GENERATIONS IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF SO MANY KIDS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE BENEFIT THAT WE ALL HAVE AT. AND AS A RESULT.WE'RE SEEN. EVEN INCREASE SYSTEMATIC RACISM. WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND HAVE THIS DIVERSITY. EVEN IF YOU'RE WHITE THAT HURTS YOU TO. IT HURTS THE ENTIRE PROCESS AND GETS US INTO A SITUATION QUITE FRANKLY LIKE WE'RE IN TODAY. I'VE BEEN A- REALLY FLABBERGASTED BY EVERYTHING GOING ON I THINK LIKE WE ALL ARE AND WATCHING THE FRUSTRATION ESPECIALLY OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR REALLY JUST REACHING OUT TO TRY TO CHANGE THINGS RIGHT NOW TAKING TO THE STREETS. AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM CHANGE THINGS HERE TO CORRECT A MISGUIDED SET WE THOUGHT BY REPEALING ARE ONE FORM OF EQUITY WHAT WOULD PUT US IN A BETTER SPOT AND IT HASN'T SO WE'RE ASKING TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY EVERYBODY TO ONCE AGAIN OPEN IT BACK UP. TO ALLOWS AN OPPORTUNITY. WHETHER YOU'RE A WOMAN A PERSON OF COLOR. AN UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY TO HAVE THAT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS ONE OF MANY FACTORS WHEN YOU'RE QUALIFY OTHERWISE QUALIFIED TO GET A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT OR TO GET INTO A SCHOOL. IT'S IMPORTANT TO US. AND OUR LATINO CAUCUS IS PROUD TO STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH OUR BLACK CAUCUS IN ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE ON A CA FIVE. THANK YOU MS CONSULTANTS GRAYSON YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND CALLING SITE RISES WELL SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE. IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH TO LOOK AT CURRENT EVENTS AND SEE WHERE THE NATION IS. THIS IS A NATION THAT IS GRAPPLING WITH ITS IMPRESSIVE PAST AND LINGERING AFFECTS. THE KILLINGS OF GEORGE FLOYD BRIANNA TAYLOR. AND FAR TOO MANY MORE HAVE SHOWN. THAT WE MUST DO MORE TO LIVE UP TO OUR NATION'S PROMISE OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. I BRING THIS UP IN THE CONTEXT OF A CA FIVE. BECAUSE SYSTEMIC RACISM IS INTERCONNECTED. THE SAME SYSTEM THAT HAVE ALLOWED FOR DISPROPORTIONATE POLICING OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE ALSO ALLOWED FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WOMEN. TO BE LOCKED OUT OF EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AS A AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. WE SHOULD BE COMMITTED TO ENSURING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS LONG LONG OVERDUE. AND I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT ACA FIVE A MEASURE THAT TAKES. A STEP CLOSER TO. ACHIEVE A FAIR AND JUST CALIFORNIA. BY PASSING A SIXTY FIVE WE CAN SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO UNDOING DECADES OF EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC HARM TO WOMEN. THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS PROVIDES IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BY INCREASING PUBLIC. IN A PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION THAT YOU SEE IN THIS YOU CAMPUSES. WHILE THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO FURTHER ADDRESS INEQUITIES AND EMPLOYMENT. WAGES PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING AND R. K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. AC FIVE WILL SET US ON THE PATH TOWARDS EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. AND I DO CHALLENGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO MORE THAN JUST CAST YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR AND SUPPORT TODAY. BUT TO ALSO CHALLENGE TO SHOW UP AND BE PRESENT IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT NOT ONE CONSTITUENTS IS TO NOT AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. TO SUCCEED. SIMPLY BECAUSE O THEIR THANK YOU. NAME IS AND DOCTOR CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS SAW OF THE ASSEMBLY I STANDING OPPOSITION OF ALL A. C. A. FIVE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I HAVE A GREAT THE RESPECT OF ALL MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE I. L. FOR THE AMAZING WORK. THAT YOU DO IS SEND THE EVERYDAY IN THIS A GREAT STATE. I AM A MINORITY A PERSON OF COLOR YOU MAY SAY. LET US BE CLEAR WHAT THE AC EIGHTY FIVE IS ARE TRYING TO DO TO DO THAT IS SO REPEALING PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO END THIS SPECIAL AND THE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF WHAT INDIVIDUAL SO BASED ON THEIR RACE SEX COLOR ETHNICITY. AND THE NATIONAL ORIGIN THE ACT OF WAR GIVING SPECIAL OR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO SOMEONE BASED ON THEIR RACE IS SO RAISES SOME ITSELF. OR ON THE SEX IS A SUBSYSTEM. JUST ASK YOURSELF FOUR IS IT RIGHT TO GIVE US SOMEONE A JOB. JUST BECAUSE OF THE WHITE WHAT BLACK OF ONE GREEN WHY ARE YELLOW OR JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE MALE. REPEALING PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE ENACTED A BY THE BORDER LOS TWENTY FOUR YES OUR GOAL IS TO REPEAL THE PROHIBITS CHEN OF A JUDGMENT A BASED ON RACE SEX COLOR ETHNICITY AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LEGALIZING RACISM AND SEXISM. COLLEAGUES ARE I DO NOT DOUBT WHEN I LEAVE A IN A STATE TO WHERE THE COLOR OF MY SKIN OR MY READY SO ONE MAIS SEXO WERE MINE NATIONAL ORIGIN DETERMINES ON MY QUALIFICATIONS SO FOR A POSITION. A JOB POOL WA ENTERING TOLL COLLEGE. I CAME HERE TO THIS COUNTRY TO GET AWAY FROM IDEOLOGIST SELECT THAT. IT IS SO FOR THOSE REASONS OF THAT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK OF FOR YOU A NO VOTE. COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THEY ARE CHOI MISTER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNITION READ CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY SIGNED THE FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. TO ENSURE THAT AMERICANS ARE TREATED FAIRLY WHEN IT COMES TO RACE COLOR. OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE VISION TO REVERSE THE LEGACY OF PAST RACISM IN THE IMPACT OF ONGOING DISCRIMINATION. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT THAT VISION WAS NEVER CHEAT. DECADES AFTER HIS ASSASSINATION AND THE ASSASSINATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS. RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION AND THEIR IMPACT ON INEQUALITY AND POVERTY CONTINUE TO THIS DAY. DECADES AFTER THE FIRST MARCHES FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MARCHING IN THE STREETS TO DATE AND THOSE SAME WRONGS. NOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GONNA BE SAID ON THIS TOPIC TODAY SO I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CONVERSATION AND MY AT THE COMMUNITY. AS RELATED IN SOME OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND EMAILS I'VE RECEIVED ON THIS TOPIC. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION WANT YOU TO BELIEVE THAT ASIAN AMERICANS UNILATERALLY OPPOSE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS REPRESENTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASIAN AMERICANS SUPPORT THIS MEASURE SURVEYS SHOW A MAJORITY OF OUR COMMUNITY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND WHY. THEY KNOW THAT WHEN PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE IS LIFTED. ASIAN AMERICANS WILL RECEIVE MORE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE IN CONTRACTING THE DATA SHOWS THAT ASIAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES. WHEN MORE CONTRACTS AND CITIES WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LIKE A LANA FOR CHICAGO THEN IN MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE OLDEST ASIAN COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTRY. IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT I. HER ALL THE TIME THAT MY ASIAN AMERICAN CONSTITUENTS WANT MORE TEACHERS WHO LOOK LIKE US MORE PRINCIPLES UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS MORE FIRST RESPONDERS FIREFIGHTERS BI LINGUAL POLICE OFFICERS. CURRENT LAW PREVENTS THAT. AND FINALLY SOME FACTS ABOUT EDUCATION FACT. UNIVERSITIES THE PRACTICE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OF SEEN GREATER GAINS IN ASIAN AMERICAN ENROLLMENT IN SCHOOLS THAT DON'T. FAX ASIAN ADMISSION RATES TO THE UC'S INCLUDING THE GREAT SCHOOLS ARE BERKELEY AND UCLA HAVE ACTUALLY GONE DOWN SINCE THE PROP TWO OH NINE BàN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AND ONE MORE FACT IF ACA FIVE PASSES THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY RULED THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE USED TO SET QUOTAS. I ALSO WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL HISTORY. I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE ON THIS FLOOR. AS THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN TO REPRESENT EASTERN SAN FRANCISCO BUT FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WHEN I WAS NINETEEN. I WAS ADMITTED TO A PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE MINORITY STUDENTS TO CONSIDER CAREERS IN PUBLIC POLICY. I WOULD HAVE GOT A FELLOWSHIP TO GO TO PUBLIC POLICY SCHOOL AT HARVARD OR PUT ON THE PATH TO BE WHERE I AM TO DAY. AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID SO MANY OF US WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. BUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WHEN HEREBY POINTING OUT ONE THING ABOUT TODAY'S VOTE. TODAY'S VOTE IS NOT GOING TO DO WAY WITH PROP TWO OH NINE TODAY'S VOTE SIMPLY GIVES CALIFORNIANS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION A QUARTER CENTURY AFTER PROP TWO ONE NINE WHEN WE SHOULD ALLOW A NEW GENERATION OF VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER WE ARE DOING ENOUGH TO IT. TO ADDRESS THE SPIRITS. VOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO THE SIDE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD RUN STEM CAMPS FOR GIRLS. AND NOT HAVE A BAND BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS GENDER. VOTER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE IF A POLICE REVIEW BOARD. SHOULD CONSIDER THE RACIAL BACKGROUND OF ITS APPLICANTS AND NOT HAVE A BAND FOR CONSIDERING RACE. VOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE IF WE CAN A PROGRAMS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LET NEXT DOCTORS TO ADDRESS ENORMOUS HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND VOTER SHOULD DECIDE IF ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES DECIMATED BY COVERT RACISM SHOULD GET SOME ASSISTANCE. IF THIS MEASURES PASSED BY VOTERS IT'S SIMPLY LIFTS A BAN. BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER NOVEMBER IS THAT THE PUBLIC. LOCAL STATE GOVERNMENTS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS PLEASE ACCOUNTABILITY BOARDS. CAN GO TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN WORK ON NEW SOLUTIONS TO MAKE OUR STATE. A TRUE STATE OF OPPORTUNITY. IN CLOSING LET ME ALSO ADMIT THAT I HAD SOME INITIAL MISGIVINGS ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS THE RIGHT TIME TO MOVE ON THIS MEASURE. BECAUSE THIS IS A TOUGH CONVERSATION. BUT LET ME SAY IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN. IF NOT US THEN WHO THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT IT'S TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT ACA FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER TO. MS WICKS. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE CA FIVE AND COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR TAKING ON YET ANOTHER RIGHTEOUS FIGHT. AS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PROTEST THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD AND THE CENTURIES OF OPPRESSION RACISM THAT LED TO THE LAST EIGHT MINUTES AND FORTY THREE SECONDS OF HIS LIFE. IT IS PAST TIME TO ADMIT THE RACISM HAS INFECTED EVERY SYSTEM OF THIS NATION. CALIFORNIA IS NOT IMMUNE FROM THIS DISEASE OF RACISM YET SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO NINE WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE BLINDERS ON TO THIS UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS. PROP TWO NINE IS A MANIFESTATION OF OUR REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE DAMAGE THAT SYSTEMIC RACISM SEXISM HAS CAUSED CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR. THIS IS MADE EASIER TO BE SHOCKED- ME SEE DISCRIMINATION FIRSTHAND WHETHER IT'S AS A MICROGRAPHS IN PUBLIC HATE SPEECH ONLINE ONE UNARMED BLACK PERSON BEING MURDERED BY POLICE IN THE STREETS. THE FIRST STEP TO CURING THE DEEPLY ROOTED RACISM DISEASE OF RACISM IS BY DIAGNOSING IT AND REJECTING FAULTY TREATMENTS LIKE PROP TWO OH NINE. THAT PROMISE RESULTS SUCH AS COLOR BLIND CALIFORNIA DOES NOT SEE RACE. THE REALITY IS THAT PROP TWO NINE WAS NOT A CURE ALL. FOR DISCRIMINATION IN FACT THE MEASURE WAS A REGRESSIVE CHANGE TO OUR STATE CONSTITUTION THAT DECIMATED CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO FIGHT DISCRIMINATION. SINCE PROP TWO NINE PASSED WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE LOST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. THERE'S BEEN DRAMATIC AT THERE'S BEEN DRAMATIC DECREASES IN ADMISSION RATES FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND WOMEN HAVE CONTINUED TO BE PAID LESS THAN MEN A WAGE GOT THAT IS EVEN WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. WELL A CA FIVE WILL NOT REMEDY ALL THE ILLS CAUSEWAY RACISM AND SEXISM IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS A HUGE LEAP FORWARD. THE WILL OUR STATE TO PROACTIVELY FIGHT THEM. THIS WILL REDUCE RACE CONSCIOUS PROGRAMS THIS WILL INCLUDE RACE CONSCIOUS PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERY COMMUNITY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FULL BREADTH OF PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES. WHICH ARE SHAPED BY THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND SEXISM THE PREVENTS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. REPEALING PROP TWO NINE IS NOT ABOUT SETTING QUOTAS. IT'S ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THAT STARTS WITH RECOGNIZING THAT THE BARRIERS SYSTEMIC RACISM AND SEXISM CREATE SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT HELP PEOPLE OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES I WORKING TO PARMALEE DISMANTLE THEM. WE CANNOT HAVE COLLECTIVE SUCCESS WITHOUT SHARED OPPORTUNITY AND A CA FIVE IS UNNECESSARY AND LONG OVERDUE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. IF YOU'VE WATCHED THE EVENTS OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS LIKE MANY OF US HAVE. WATCH THIS UNFOLD ON YOUR TELEVISION ON YOUR PHONE YOU'VE SEEN THE VIDEOS IF YOU WATCH THE PAIN AND ANGUISH. THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE EXPRESSED. IN THESE WRETCHES PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AND IF YOU HAVE WONDERED WHAT CAN I DO TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SOLUTION. HOW CAN I BE AN ALLY HOW CAN I BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION WELL HERE'S A CHANCE FOR YOU. I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS. IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS WICKS MISTER RAMOS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND PROP TWO OH NINE IS AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO REPEAL I STAND HERE TO FULLY SUPPORT ACA FIVE. THE NEXT THURSDAY JUNE EIGHTEENTH HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MARKS. THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY THAT THIS STATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORMER WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE HISTORICAL VIOLENCE MALTREATMENT NEGLECT AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AGAINST CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPEAL TWO OH NINE WILL GO TO THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT ACA FIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL. COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE REPRESENTED. IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THE STATE SANCTIONED OVER CENTURY OF ATTACKS PLUNDERING PILLAGING AND PREJUDICIAL POLICIES AGAINST CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS. I WANT TO THANK US A QUAN BAND. THE PEOPLE OF CALL ME I NATION FOR THEIR SUPPORT ALSO IN MOVING FORWARD THE REPERCUSSIONS OF THOSE DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES STILL PERSIST TODAY. WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE OF THOSE PRACTICES CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS REMAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THROUGH DISEASE EDUCATION ATTAINMENT LACK OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND DIMINISHED EMPLOYMENT ENTERTAINMENT 31% A NATIVE AMERICANS EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION WHEN APPLYING FOR JOBS. I STAND HERE TODAY. IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AS THE FIRST CALIFORNIA INDIAN ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WHAT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHY HAS IT TAKEN SO LONG FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. IT'S BECAUSE OF POLICIES LIKE THIS. THAT WE NEED TO REPEAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE A FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT AND MOVING FORWARD. IT'S TIME THAT WE ALL COME TOGETHER AS CALIFORNIAN ALL COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER TO FURTHER THE QUEST OF EQUALITY FOR ALL OF US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- JR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER RAMOS MR GLORIA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FROM THE PODIUM IN THE WALL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LGBT Q. CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE. I WANT TO TAKE MY GREAT COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE MEMBERS THAT ALL OF US ARE MINDFUL OF THE STATE OF OUR NATION. AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FUNDAMENTALLY THE CHALLENGE BEING FACED IS THE STRUCTURE OF THIS NATION FROM ITS LAWS TO ITS OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN RIGGED AGAINST COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS. WHAT WE'RE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST RIGHT NOW IS NOT ONLY POLICING. THAT'S JUST THE START. IF THE SYSTEMIC AND HISTORIC LACK OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT AN OPPORTUNITY IN AND FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS SAD HISTORY. MEMBERS IT'S NOT THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND THEY START BEHIND. IT HAS PREVENTED EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK AND BROWN BUSINESSES FOR WOMEN IN BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN PUBLIC CONTRACTING PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR DECADES. IT'S OUT OF DATE IT'S OUT OF SYNC WITH WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIANS IT DOES NOT HELP US BUILD THE CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL THAT WE SHOW UP HERE EACH EIGHT TO WORK TO CREATE. IT'S TIME THAT WE ARE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION. IT'S FINALLY TIME TO UNDO THIS INJUSTICE IN ADVANCE REAL RACIAL AND GENDER EQUITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS WHEN I WAS YOUNG. MY PARENTS SAT ME DOWN AND EXPLAINED TO ME THE SUMMER WITH THIS COMPLEXION HAS TO WORK TWICE AS HARD. TO GET JUST AS FAR. THE QUESTION THAT WE SHOULDASK OURSELVES IS WHY IS THAT. WHY SHOULD THAT STAND PARTICULARLY IN THE GOLDEN STATE. HI HUMBLY SUGGEST YOU THE ANSWER IS THAT IT JUST SHOULD NOT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND JUSTICE HERE TODAY. SO I STAND HERE IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LGBT Q. CAUCUS IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS. IN ASKING THIS BODY TAKE THIS STEP TO FINALLY GIVE WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS STATE. A GREATER SHOT AT SUCCESS OF THAT CALIFORNIA DREAM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU EITHER. THANK YOU MISS GLORIA. MISS THE MARK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE WHICH IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WE'RE LIVING THROUGH UNPRECEDENTED TIMES THE PANDEMIC COUPLED WITH ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE NATION CALL ON TO AND- THE MANY VOICES THAT FOR DECADES HAVE GONE ON HEARD. AS WE HE'LL PICK UP THE PIECES WE MUST WRK TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY STATE AND NATION BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE CONVERSATION THAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY IS ONE THAT WILL ALLOW THE MANY VOICES IN CALIFORNIA TO WEIGH IN ON WHERE WE WANT TO FALL ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR MINORITIES. IF YOU ARE WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF FORTY AND SEVENTY THREE. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION APPLIED TO YOU. YOU BENEFITTED FROM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AC FIVE GIVE CALIFORNIA VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER AND POTENTIALLY REPEAL PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE THROUGH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WELL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ARE FLOURISHING NATIONALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF OPPORTUNITIES. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE NATION WITH ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION WOMEN OWNED FIRMS EMPLOYING MORE THAN ONE MILLION PEOPLE AND GENERATING A COMBINED ANNUAL REVENUE OF TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND YET. A TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN STUDY SHOWS THAT BUSINESS OWNED BY BUSINESSES OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR LOSE ONE POINT ONE BILLION. ANNUALLY IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. 60% OF ALL AMERICANS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS DURING THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ARE WOMEN. ACA FIVE WOULD ALLOW FOR A CONVERSATION AND HOW WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES GIVING A VOICE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN AWARDED GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND STATE HIRING TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT SOLUTION SPUR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WILL HELP. ALL MEMBERS A KID OR OF OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE MOST VULNERABLE. BY EXPANDING JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKES A CRITICAL STEP IN CLOSING THE GENDER GAP. WOMEN MAKE EIGHTY ONE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY MEN. IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE WAGE GAP IS EVEN WIDER FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. BLACK WOMEN MAKE SIXTY TWO CENTS TO THE DOLLAR FOR A WHITE MAN AND LATINOS MAKE FIFTY FOUR CENTS TO THE DOLLAR. WITH EIGHTY FIVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNLOCK CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC POTENTIAL AN OPPORTUNITY THAT CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE MISSED. REALIZING THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES REQUIRES CHANGING POLICIES BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ATTITUDES. THIS IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS VOTED TO MAKE AC FIVE A PRIORITY BILL FOR US THIS YEAR AND ALLOWING CALIFORNIANS TO WAIT IN ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THANK YOU MISS AMOUNT MR GABRIEL. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF A CA FIVE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS. OUR CAUCUS HAS VOTED TO SUPPORT ACA FIVE WE THINK IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT MEASURE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BEING. SUCH A MORAL VOICE IN THIS BODY AND FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JURORS CAUCUS SUPPORTS THIS BILL. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE IT IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN OUR VALUES OUR TRADITION TEACHES US TO VALUE JUSTICE. TO VALUE EQUITY TO VALUE HUMAN DIGNITY TO VALUE PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE SO THIS IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHO WE ARE. AND HOW WE DEFINE OURSELVES AS A COMMUNITY. THERE'S ALSO FIRMLY ROOTED IN OUR HISTORIC SUPPORT FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S A DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS ON MANY THINGS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. THE ONE THING THAT IS BROADLY SHARED IN OUR COMMUNITY IS THE PRIDE THAT WE FELT THAT SO MANY RABBIS. SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN IT SUPPORTED THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. NURSING KNOWLEDGE MINT IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT THAT THE STRUGGLE THE STILL RIGHTS MOVEMENT IS SO FAR FROM FINISHED. AND SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND STAND. IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE BLACK COMMUNITY WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WITH WOMEN IS THEY CAN CONTINUE TO ST STRIVE TO. EQUALITY ONE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO MIGHT NOT BE INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS THAT. I ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE HOPEFULLY IT'S AN EASY VOTE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS TODAY. BECAUSE IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE POLICY I HOPE THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT. IN HISTORY RIGHT NOW. AN UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT WE HAVE WITNESSED PROTESTS. ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. OFTEN IN PLACES WHERE WE WOULD NOT EXPECT THEM. WHERE PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING. NOT JUST JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD. THE DEMANDING SYSTEMIC CHANGE. THE DEMANDING SO SOME EXCHANGE AND MY- COLLEAGUE AND I FROM HOW ALSO WERE TALKING LAST NIGHT ABOUT THE FACT. THAT ANYONE WHO IS UNDER THE AGE OF FORTY ONE HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE. THAT THEY ARE THAT OUR GENERATION HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK TO THIS AND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT IT'S BEEN. A QUARTER OF A CENTURY SINCE VOTERS WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT OUR GENERATION. I'M THIRTY EIGHT A COLLEAGUE I THINK IS A IS APPROACHING FORTY WERE NOT THAT YOUNG- OUR- GENERATION. HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. AND I THINK. THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS ISSUE. THAT LEFT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. I THINK DEMAND. FOR CHIU THIS. THE DEMAND FOR OFFICE. CHANGE THAT WE ARE WITNESSING FOR PEOPLE A- THIS COUNTRY. BE EXTRAORDINARILY SHORT SIGHTED ABBAS AND I THINK I WOULD SUGGEST. REALLY TONE DEAF. FOR US NOT TO PERMIT VOTERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH ON ON THIS. AT THE SAME TIME OUT ALSO. THAT THIS IS A CHEN. AND COMPLEX ISSUE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE IT REQUIRES US TO BE HONEST ABOUT SOME PARTS OF OUR HISTORY THAT ARE HARD TO THINK ABOUT. REQUIRES US TO BE HONEST ABOUT HOW BADLY THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M A WHEN I HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS ABOUT THESE ISSUES OFTENTIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL WHAT ABOUT ECONOMIC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WHY CAN'T WE JUST FOCUS ON ON POVERTY IN THERE THERE'S MERIT TO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT POVERTY IS A REAL ISSUE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT RACE AND GENDER MATTER. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE BASED ON RACE AND GENDER IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WAY THAT THEY LIVE THEIR LIVES. IN AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT. IT ALSO IGNORES HIS. IGNORES THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CENTURIES OF SAYS OF SYSTEMIC RACIAL INJUSTICE THAT HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED IN SO MANY PARTS OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY. IN EDUCATION IN ZONING AND HOUSING AND IT'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT. FACETS OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY WE HAVE SEEN THINGS THAT HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WOMEN. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SUGGEST ALL OF US WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I THINK ALL OF US KNOW IN OUR HEARTS. THE RACE AND GENDER MATTER. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A PERSON IN HERE WHO WOULD WOULD DISPUTE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT IMPACT US AND THAT THE IMPACT ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS VERY DAY. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT VOTE. AND TO THOSE WHO MIGHT THINK THAT. IS THAT. THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IS SOMETHING THAT ZERO SUM MIGHT OFFER. I OFTEN ALTERNATE PERSPECTIVE. BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY. WHEN I THINK A LOT ABOUT THE- THE SEMINAL SUPREME COURT CASES FROM THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ABOUT ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE STRONGEST AND MOST PERSUASIVE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE ULTIMATELY CITED IN JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S OPINION CAME FROM THE MILITARY. THE SECOND IS COMMUNITY THAT IS WAITING IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S A IT'S A CENTRAL TO OUR COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESSES TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR MILITARY AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST EVERYBODY THAT EVERYBODY WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS WE WILL HAVE A SOCIETY THAT STREET THAT FREE- THAT'S HEALTHIER AND STRONGER. WEALTHIER THAT'S MORE COHESIVE THE MORE EQUITABLE AND MARCH STE LOSS OF A SOCIETY THAT'S BRAVE ENOUGH TO BE HONEST ABOUT HOW BADLY THIS SYSTEM IS RIGGED AND BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND I THINK THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL GIFT FOR US IF TO OUR CHILDREN AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IBM. THANK WAS GABRIEL MS BOERNER HORVATH. NEXT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO ECHO- MY SUPPORT FOR A CA FIVE OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED WITH YOU. BUT I WANT TO SHARE PERSONAL STORY. IN MARCH A FIFTH GRADE CLASS FOR MY DISTRICT CAME TO THE CAPITOL TO ADVOCATE FOR EQUITY NOT JUST EQUALITY. AND THE PRESUMPTION BE TO BEHIND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS TO CREATE AN OPTION FOR THOSE LEADERS WHO WANT TO FIGHT THE HISTORIC GENDER AND RACIAL BIAS. AND CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. EQUITY AC FIVE IS ONE STEP IN THAT DIRECTION IT GIVES THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD. ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T VOTE TWO DECADES AGO. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE CURRENT NATIONAL DISCOURSE. I THINK OF THOSE FIFTH GRADERS CAN UNDERSTAND EQUITY WE CAN'T TO I ORDERED YOUR SUPPORT OF A FEW FIVE. THANK YOU THIS BOERNER HORVATH MR STONE YOUR RECOGNIZE. I'M AN ENDING SEXISM AND THAT'S NEVER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. AB TWO OH NINE WAS ABOUT PRESERVING PRIVILEGE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I AM COLOR BLIND WHAT THEY'RE BLIND TO IS THEIR OWN PRIVILEGE. WHAT THEIR BLINDS TO IS THE BENEFIT AND THE RESILIENCE IN THE BEAUTY OF CULTURES THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH. MEMBERS IF WE STOP TALKING ABOUT GENDER. SEXISM WHEN. IF WE STOP TALKING ABOUT RACE. RACISM WITH THAT'S WHAT PROP TWO OH NINE IS ABOUT AND ANYTHING ELSE. IS THAT LIVE. IT IS TIME WE AND THAT WHY IT IS TIME WE STAND UP TO THOSE WHO HAVE HAD PRIVILEGE. AND USE THAT PRIVILEGE TO KEEP OTHER PEOPLE DOWN. AND AWAY FROM THAT PRIVILEGE ACA FIVE IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND IF WE CAN'T COMPLETELY REPEAL PROP TWO OH NINE. IF WE CAN'T COMPLETELY REPEAL THE LAWS THAT HAVE BUILT SYSTEMIC RACISM AND SEXISM INTO MOST EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS. THEN WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THAT JUST A CA FIVE THIS IS A STEP WE CAN TAKE THIS IS FOREVER ALL OF US WHO HAVE BEEN OUT TO THE PROTESTS AND SHOWN SOLIDARITY. THAT'S ONE THING THIS IS WHERE WE CAN SHOW THAT THERE'S MORE THAN JUST. LIP SERVICE TO THIS ISSUE THAT WE CAN START TO REALLY ADDRESS RACISM SEXISM AT ITS CORE WE HAVE TO PASS A- MISTER KALRA. YOUR RECOGNIZE. AN MEMBERS OF MY RISE IN. SUPPORT OF AC FIVE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT TO THE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN FORTY TWO OTHER STATES IN ALLOWING FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ONCE AGAIN. AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT. THE LAST FEW WEEKS IN PARTICULAR- IF WE'RE GOING TO STAND WITH OUR BLACK SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN THE STREETS AND CLAIM THE BLACK LIVES MATTER. YEAH JUST DO THAT WITH WORDS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE CONCRETE STEPS. THAT ACTUALLY CAN PROVE THAT WE MEAN IT. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MARCHING WITH WOMEN OR LAMENTING THE GENDER PAY GAP. WE CAN'T SIMPLY JUST OUR HANDS UP. AND EXCEPT FOR A FACT. THAT THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS IN OUR COUNTRY OR OUR STATE. IF WHAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA MORE THE STAINS OUR HISTORY BUT THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OR JAPANESE INTERMENT WE HAVE UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT UNDER WHICH THOSE HORRORS OF KURT OR FOR GOING TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN SICK AMERICAN INDIAN AMERICAN CONGRESS NUMBER DOLLOP SING SONG. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT BACK IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES HE WAS OF PURE SUPPORTER OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT. HE WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS AND FARMWORKERS. AND HE DROPPED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL HE WORKED TO DROP A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. DECLARING THE QUALITY OF THE RIGHTS OF MEN AND WOMEN. WHAT HE KNEW SIXTY YEARS AGO IS WHAT WE STILL KNOW TODAY THE WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL AND ROOTING OUT RACISM AND SEXISM THIS IS NOT ABOUT LEGALIZING RACISM AND SEXISM AS ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE SAID. IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT RACISM AND SEXISM EXISTS AND IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO WE'VE NEVER WEEKEND TO ROOT IT OUT. NOW MY FAMILY CAME HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THAT'S A FACT. AND WE CAN COUNT MANY MANY THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES- API FAMILIES. WITH THAT SAME SCENARIO THAT OF A WASN'T FOR THOSE THAT GAVE THEIR LIFE GIVE THEIR BLOOD. IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. SO HE FACT THAT. THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED. AND BECAME A GLOBAL SUPERPOWER ON THE FOUNDATION OF STORM LAND A STONE LABOR IS NOT A MATTER THAT IS RELEGATED TO CHAPTERS IN DUSTY HISTORY BOOKS IT ACTUALLY RUNS THROUGH THE VEINS OF OUR NATION THIS DAY AND TO ALL OF US. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE. THE REALITY THAT RACE MATTERS. AND THAT THE LONGER WE DENY IT AND THE LONGER WE TAKE ACTION ON IT THE LONGER IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO REACH THE PROMISE. OF OUR GREAT NATION. WE AT THE RECOGNIZE THE REALITY THAT GENDER MATTERS AND WE NEED TO BE HONEST AND INTENTIONALLY THAT REALIZATION SO THAT WE MAY SOME DAY HAVE CHIU EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN AND AS OTHER COLLEAGUES OFSAID THE DATA IS VOLUMINOUS. IT'S AS CLEAR AS DAY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY. BY NO FAULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT JUST BASED UPON. OUR COMMON SHARE HISTORY. WE HAVE BARRIERS THAT ARE PUT UP STRICTLY BECAUSE OF ONE GENDER AND RACE. AND RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE WORLD ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE RISING UP BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOT ONLY THAT IT'S WRONG BUT THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND SO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW THE VOTERS. TO GET IT RIGHT. AND TO STAND UP FOR RACIAL JUSTICE FOR GENDER JUSTICE THE STAND UP FOR EQUALITY AND WHAT WORDS ON PAPER DO YOU MUST TO BE AS AMERICANS. WE NEED TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT AND I URGE YOU JUST TO VOTE I ON A CA FIVE SO WE CAN FIGHT TOGETHER. THANKS CALLER MISTER COOLEY IN THE REAR CHAMBER. COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ACA FIVE. AND PERMISSION TO READ EVER SO BRIEFLY WITHOUT OBJECTION. I HAVE HERE THE CLOSING LINES OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. I WANT TO OFFER A LITTLE REFLECTION UPON. IT IS RATHER FOR US TO BE HERE DEDICATED. TO THE GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US THAT FROM THESE HONORED DEAD WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE. FOR WHICH THEY HERE GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION. THAT WE HERE HIGHLY RESOLVE THAT THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN. THAT THIS NATION UNDER GOD. SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM. AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH. TO REFLECT UPON THIS I THINK IS SO MANY THOUGHTS COME TO MIND. ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SPARRING FOR NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM. FOR OUR NATION TO ENTER INTO A DIFFERENT QUALITY. OF ITS UNDERSTAND OF WHAT FREEDOM MEANT. THAT WAS WHAT HE SAW BEFORE US. HE SAW THIS AS SOMETHING THAT WAS AN EXTENSION OF THE WORK AND THE- SACRIFICE IT PRECEDED IT. HE SAW IT AS SOMETHING THAT WAS FOUNDED IN THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. I HAVE THE UTMOST REGARD FOR THIS CAPITAL IN THIS CHAMBER. BUT THE MEANING OF AMERICA WILL NOT BE SETTLED HERE. IT WILL BE SETTLED IN THE HEARTS OF AMERICANS IT'LL BE SETTLED IN THE HEARTS OF CALIFORNIANS. I THINK ACA FIVE. COMING AS IT DOES IN THIS YEAR. WHEN WE HAVE SEEN SO MUCH DIVISION. REALLY PRESENTS A PLEBISCITE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE CALIFORNIANS AND SAY WHAT IS THE NATURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL. CAN CELEBRATE AND HARBOR HOPE FOR ANOTHER WHO MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM NOW. YOU KNOW THERE CANNOT BE DEMOCRACY IF THERE IS NOT COMPASSION. IF THERE IS NOT EMPATHY. FOR PEOPLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN. I THINK THAT THE WHOLE MILIEU OF SOCIAL MEDIA. ACTUALLY HAS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF CONFRONTING EVERYONE WITH A DIFFERENT LIVES UPON REAL LIFE. SO I THINK THIS IS A OUTSTANDING TIME TWENTY TWENTY. TO REACH OUT TO ALL CALIFORNIA SAY SEARCH YOUR HEART. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY WHAT IS THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA MARK PERCY. CAN I CELEBRATE AN OPPORTUNITY CONFERRED UPON SOMEBODY WHO IS FACE BURDENS. YOU KNOW IT WAS JOHN DUNN WHO LIVED IN THE FIFTEEN HUNDREDS SERVED IN THE PARLIAMENT. WHO SAID NO MAN IS AN ISLAND COMPUTER TO ITSELF. IF A CLOD FALLS AWAY EUROPE IS DIMINISHED. DON'T ASK FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS IT TOLLS FOR THEE. THIS NOTION THAT WE. IF WE ARE PARTISAN TO BURN OURSELVES. WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. SO I SORT OF VIEW THIS AS A VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY I WILL SAY FOR MY WHOLE CAREER. THE MOST IMPORTANT QUOTE ON LEADERSHIP I'VE EVER HEARD WAS AGAIN NAMED MICHELLE ROO. WHO SAID THE JOB LEADERS NOT TO CHALLENGE PEOPLE. DON'T BE RATE PEOPLE DON'T WEB ON PEOPLE. THE JOB LEADERS NOT TO CHALLENGE PEOPLE BUT TO GET THEM TO CHALLENGE THEMSELVES I THINK ACA FIVE IN A VERY FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC WAY IN KEEPING WITH THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS REFLECTION UPON A MARKER SEE THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN PROVIDED IS NOT TRUE FOR PEOPLE ASIDE WHAT IS IT CARE FOR CALIFORNIA MARK PERCY AMERICAN DEMOCRACY I THINK IT IS A VERY FITTING QUESTION TO BRING FOR DOUBLE WRIST. AT THIS TIME. MUCH LIKE. THE OTHER ACA WE DISCUSSED I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR TO BRING FOR THIS QUESTION. AND ASK ALL CALIFORNIANS TO REFLECT UPON THE MEANING OF CALIFORNIA DEMOCRACY. THANK WAS COOLEY MISTER SANTIAGO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES OFFERED FOR THE- FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL. ACA FIVE AS ASSEMBLY EQUALITY IT'S ABOUT TAKING A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO BRING US JUSTICE. AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A VERY MODEST THAT. ALL THIS SAYS ANALYTICAL OF MY COLLEAGUES A SAID LET THE VOTERS DECIDE. THIS IS NOT THE SAME CALIFORNIA THAT VOTED ON THIS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE I'LL REMIND YOU ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA THERE VOTED ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY PASSED PROPOSITIONS. THAT ATTACKED OUR LANGUAGE. THEY PASSED PROPOSITIONS THAT ATTACKED IMMIGRANTS. A PAST PROPOSITIONS THAT ATTACKED OUR OPPORTUNITIES BUT THE THING CALIFORNIA TODAY AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS LET THE VOTERS DECIDE TODAY. AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A MODEST. YOU DON'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON GENERATIONS TO COME IT'S A LITTLE TO NOT TODAY WE DENY GENERATION THAT OPPORTUNITY. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITY. YEAH YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. HOW KIDS ARE RAISED. AND I'LL BE GOOD BREAK INTO A VERY VERY SIMPLE. SIMPLE STORY WHICH IS MY STORE AND IT'S NOT UNIQUE. MOST OF US HERE WHO ARE OF COLOR OR WOMEN. HAVE BENEFITTED FROM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MANY MANY OF YOU SHARE SIMILAR STORIES. IF YOUR PARENTS CAN'T CAME HERE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY AND THEY WORK EXTREMELY HARD. WASN'T MY CHOICE TO BE BORN POOR. IT WASN'T MY CHOICE THE BE BORN AND NOT UNDERSTAND A LANGUAGE. WASN'T MY CHOICE TO LIVE IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. WASN'T MY CHOICE TO WORK FULL TIME- WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE. THE DID I GET THE BEST GRADES IN THAT I GET A FOUR POINT THREE AND DIE SLAM DUNK IT IN THE IN THE UCLA RIGHT AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. COURSE NOT. THEY TAKE ME A LONG TIME. LIKE IT TOOK OTHERS TO GET THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF COURSE. PROBABLY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD. FIVE SIX YEARS ON LIKE THAT. BUT THIS IS THE REALITY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO WORK AND YOU HAVE TO HELP YOUR PARENTS MAKE RENT NO ONE CHOOSES THAT. SO THIS WHOLE IDEA. AND I'M NOT SAYING ANYONE IS THAT IT. BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA AT THE TIME. THAT CERTAIN KIDS ONE QUALIFIED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE EQUAL AND THAT RE SHOULDN'T MATTER WILL IT DOES. BECAUSE THE ZIP CODE THAT YOU WERE BORN IN DETERMINES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GO. AND IT'S NOT COINCIDENCE THAT THE ZIP CODE YOU ARE BORN IN OFTENTIMES REFLECTS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE THAT'S NOT A SECRET. IF YOU GREW UP IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I REPRESENT. MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'LL BE LOOKING. IF YOU GO UP IN CERTAIN AREAS WITHOUT THE LATE MORE THAN LIKELY YOU COULD BE AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING. SOME OF YOU I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH BUT I NEVER REALLY SHARED PUBLICLY. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE YEAH I STRUGGLED. NIGHTFALL ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AND WE THOUGHT ONE PROPOSITION AND IT WAS FOR THIS HEARTENING TO KNOW. THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED. I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO STUDY I DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO BE POLITICALLY ACTIVE. I COULD DO THOSE THINGS. AND WHEN APPLIED TO UCLA MY ONE DREAM. MY ONE DREAM NICE TO SAY WHEN I WAS A KID MY ONE WAY TO GET OUT OF THE HOOD. TO GET EDUCATION. BUT I WAS THE NIGHT. I WAS DENIED BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE THE GRADES. AND I WAS HEARTBROKEN. IT ALMOST DESTROYED MY LIFE I THINK THAT THE ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT I COULD HAVE TO HELP MY PARENTS GET A SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. GET MY LITTLE BROTHER NOT PER TUTTI. WITH THE NIGHT BECAUSE INSTEAD OF STUDYING I HAD TO GO TO WORK. AND INSTEAD OF A RECREATIONAL SUMMER VACATIONS. WE PICKED THE BAXTER JOBS. SO I APPEALED. AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE CASE THAT I MADE THE UCLA. WITH A OOK I WOULD LOVE TO GO HOME AND STUDY IN A PIE WITH A GOT A FOUR POINT THREE. BUT I COULDN'T. THIRTY SECONDS AND BECAUSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AND BECAUSE CONSIDERATION WHERE I CAME FROM. WHAT I LOOK LIKE THE LANGUAGE I SPOKE I GOT IN. I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE. MEGHAN COLLIDED AND IT WAS NEVER IT WAS NEVER ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE ABILITY. BUT HE GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE HE GAVE MANY OF US. IN THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA GIVE GENERATIONS. A PEOPLE OF COLOR. WOMEN AND WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THE STATE IT WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON WHO GOES TO THESE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. AND WHO HAD WHO HAS A SAY. IN THE COME UP THE WHAT WHEN THEY BECOME DOCTORS ATTORNEYS LEGISLATORS BECAUSE WE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE WILL NOT WASTE THAT OPPORTUNITY I CAN GUARANTEE. BECAUSE WE KNEW HOW HARD IT WAS TO GET HERE. AND WE'RE WILL DO ALL WE CAN. TO MAKE IT EASIER AND PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND ALL OUR ALLIES WERE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. GOD BLESS YOU FOR DOING IT IN TAKING A STAND. FOR EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU CAN BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. DECORAH SANTIAGO MISTER JONES SAWYER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AS CHAIR OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS. I JUST WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF ACA FIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANT. ABOUT THE HORRORS OF THE PREMATURE REPEAL OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHICH IS A LEFTY EXPERIENCE OF BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE. OUT OF THE EQUATION FOR THE SAKE OF A COLOR BLIND WORLD THAT HAS NEVER EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY BUT WE ALL KNOW IT HAS. WELL MY UNCLE WALKED UP THE STEPS OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS BLACKNESS THAT THE SUPREME COURT. TO RULE THAT HE BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE SAME SCHOOLS AS WHITES STUDENTS. HIS SKIN COLOR IN DOVER THEREFORE HIS HUMANITY BY THE VERY REASON HE HAD THE RIGHT TO INTEGRATE INTO A SCHOOL WITH MORE RESOURCES THERE WHERE HE WAS BORN. IN MY DISTRICT WHICH HAS 95% OF THE RESIDENTS EITHER BEING LATINO OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. AC EIGHT FIVE DIRECTLY IMPACTS AND BENEFIT THOSE IN MY DISTRICT BY PROCLAIMING THEIR BACKGROUND. AND EXPERIENCES MATTER AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR PUBLIC HIRING AND ADMISSION PURPOSES. REALLY DO NOT LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND SOCIETY SO IT IS TIME THAT WE STOP ACTING LIKE IT. WHEN I WAS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. I WOULD TELL MY STAFF WE WOULD HAVE AN AUCTION TO SELL CITY PROPERTY. THAT WE NEEDED TO ADVERTISE IN THE PAPERS AFTER AMERICAN LATINO FILIPINO JAPANESE. AND THE FIRST AUCTION THAT I WAS OVER THEY NEVER ADVERTISED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY ADVERTISE IN A PREDOMINATELY WHITE NEWSPAPERS. AND WHEN I BROUGHT THEM INTO MY OFFICE. ALL WHITE MALES. THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE OF THE PROP TWO OH NINE THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ANY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICIES THEY DID NOT HAVE TO ADVERTISE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND BESIDES. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. AFTER I CALMED DOWN. I MADE IT VERY CLEAR FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT THAT YOU'RE LEAVING OUT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PAY MORE FOR THE POOR THOSE PROPERTIES THEN THE PEOPLE YOU BELIEVE IN AND THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ADVERTISE IN THOSE PAPERS. SO I FORCED AND I NOTICE HOW READ THEIR FACES GOT AND HOW ANGRY THEY GOT. THE NEXT AUCTION WE HEAD. I WAS SO HAPPY. THAT THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR A PROPERTY IN THAT AUCTION. WENT TO A MEMBER OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY WHICH FURTHER PROVE TO ME AND TELL THEM THAT YOU NEED TO INCLUDE EVERYONE. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I ALSO REALIZED WHY HE WAS SO ANGRY. WHY THEY WERE SO ANGRY. THEY DIDN'T NEVER THOUGHT IN THEIR CAREERS. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A BLACK MAN TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO. AND IN FACT I WAS PROBABLY THE WORST NIGHTMARE. IN FACT WHEN I SCORED NUMBER ONE ON THE TEST TO BE THEIR BOSS. OTHERS WERE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THAT BY PICKING SOMEONE A WHITE MALE FOR THAT POSITION EVEN THOUGH HE HAD NOT. PASS THE TEST. LUCKILY FOR ME. THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DEPARTMENT SAID WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH. THE NUMBER ONE CANDIDATE. AND I BELIEVE LUCKILY FOR ME THE GENERAL MANAGER WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. WHO WAS APPOINTED BY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAYOR. SO MAYOR TOM BRADLEY. APPOINTED MY GENERAL MANAGER HE WAS ELECTED NOT IN THE SEVENTIES. YOU POINT AT MY GENERAL MANAGERS IN THE NINETIES. AND THEN I WAS BROUGHT ON. IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. IT WAS TO TRY TECH TO OF NIGHTMARES OF NIGHTMARES FOR ANY RACES IN ANY. COMMUNITY OR ANY INFRASTRUCTURE BUT MORE IMPORTANT ANY BUREAUCRACY LIKE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. I WAS ABLE TO BREAK UP. THE RACISM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. BY BEING NUMBER ONE ON THE TEST BY STAYING TRUE TO MY NATURE BUT MOST IMPORTANT MAKING SHORT DID NOT DID NOT GO ALONG TO GET ALONG OR TO PERPETUATE THE WORD RACISM WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT AND DOING WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO. ON THE LEGACY THAT I STAND ON ON THE SHOULDERS THAT I STAND ON TO MAKE SURE THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THE REPEAL OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WAS TERRIBLE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET THE VOTERS DECIDE. THE MISTAKE THAT WE MADE BECAUSE I VOTER DURING THAT TIME AND I VOTED AGAINST IT EVEN GOT. THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES WHEN I WAS ASSISTANT DEPUTY MAYOR. TO VOTE DOWN THE REPEAL OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THIRTY SECONDS SO WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN THIS. AND WE ALL HAVE RIGHT NOW A BOAT IN THIS WE ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT A WRONG. ONE MEMBER AT A TIME ONE PERSON AT A AT A TIME. SO THAT THIS BECOMES A BETTER WORLD AND THANK GOD HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY WE NEVER SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STREETS AGAIN BECAUSE WE'VE NOW MOVED. WE MOVED THE AGENDA TO A BETTER PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER MISTER MAIENSCHEIN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE COMFORTABLE OPPOSING A CA FIVE BASED ON AN ASSERTION THAT RACE DOESN'T MATTER BUT FACTS ARE FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION JOBS SCHOOLS CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HOMEOWNERSHIP. AFRICAN AMERICANS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN HAVE SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION. ACA FIVE WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO VOTE TO HELP END THIS DISCRIMINATION RACE DOES MATTER I'M VOTING YES ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. MS CRISTINA GARCIA HERE RECOGNIZE THANK YOU I READ THROUGH THE PORT OF EIGHTY FIVE I TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO LIKE WITH THE DETAILS OUT THERE PROTESTING AS MAKING PHONE CALLS ALL TALKING AND DOORS AGAINST FIVE TWO ONE NINE AND MY ARGUMENT THEN IS THE SAME AS IT IS TODAY. UP TO A NINE IS ABOUT PUSHING A FALSE NARRATIVE. THAT WE HAVE AN EQUITABLE EQUAL SYSTEM. SO CALLED NEGATIVE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE IN FULL CHARGE OF THEIR FAITH. BUT WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE BLACK OR BROWN IF YOU'RE A WOMAN. NO MORE LIKELY TO BE POOR MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POLLUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON TRAIN TEACHERS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED OR TO THEIR WHICH REALLY. AND THE LIST GOES ON. THIS FALSE NARRATIVE ALSO IMPLIES THAT WE FAIL TO SIXTY. BECAUSE WE DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH. BECAUSE THIS IS THE REWARDS HARD WORK EQUALLY. WE ALSO NOTICED A SMALL. THE REALITY IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS MADE TO MAKE BROWN AND BLACK PEOPLE FEEL MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. AND IT'S AMERICA SOME OF THOSE DO HAVE MOBILITY. BUT WHEN WE DO THAT MOBILITY IS USED TO PRESERVE ALTERNATIVE. THAT WE WORK HARD ENOUGH WE CAN MAKE IT AND WE CAN BE A SUCCESS. THE REALITY IS THAT BEING A TOKEN. IS FAR FROM BEING AN EQUAL VOICE. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS THAT ABOUT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT. IT'S ABOUT A KNOWLEDGE IN THAT THE SYSTEM IS AN EQUAL. THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND SEXISM. THAT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER. MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US I COULD DO EVERYTHING RIGHT IN BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN AND A WOMAN OF COLOR IS LIKELY NOT TO BE ENOUGH. EASY ADVISED OPPORTUNITIES THAT AGAINST THE SMALL OF NARRATIVE. IN TO BE AN ALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS THE MOST ANYTHING BUT FAIR. WE HAVE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO ENSURE WE HAVE INCREASED AT THE- TOP OF OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN. AND MAYBE CLEARLY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY DO WE RISE TO THE OCCASION BUT WE NEED BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE. TWICE AS GOOD FOR D. SANTA FOR GOOD. AND SO I HOPE THAT TODAY WE HAVE CORRECT AND JUSTICE THAT WAS THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AT THE BALLOT. IN IS NOT ENOUGH TO VOTE YES ON THE CA FIVE. WILL BE ON YOUR DISTRICT YOU CAMPAIGN BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PULL THIS AND WE. AND THE SOUTH AREAS. THANK YOU. THANK MISTER CMS. GAL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS- I RISE TODAY IS AS SOMEONE WHO IS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN CONFRONTED ONCE AGAIN. IN THIS COUNTRY WITH THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE NOT EQUAL AND THAT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID. REYES DOES MATTER. BUT AS I STAND AND CONSIDER THIS MEASURE. I CAN'T SAY THAT PROP TWO OH NINE IS THE PROBLEM. IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE- THAT HAVE BEEN STATED HERE ON THIS FOR TODAY AND THE AND THE EXPERIENCES THAT. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED TODAY THOSE ARE IMPORTANT AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES. THE INEQUITIES THAT. WE CAN SEE VERY CLEARLY IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. BUT I SAY THAT PROP TWO NINE IS NOT THE PROBLEM- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATS- THE GETTING RID OF A RACIAL PREFERENCES DID NOT ACTUALLY LEAD TO DECREASES IT ACTUALLY LEAD TO INCREASES- AND LATINO STUDENTS BEING ADMITTED IT LEAD TO INCREASES IN ASIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS BEING ADMITTED. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATS. ADMISSIONS OF BLACK STUDENTS REMAINED STAGNANT. IN THE UC SYSTEM 4% THERE HASN'T IN PROGRESS THERE. THAT'S A PROBLEM LET'S GO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A MISSION BECAUSE LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN RETAINING STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE IN. HIGHER EDUCATION. THE STATS SHOW THAT 38% OF BLACK STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS FROM THE UC SYSTEM. IN CSU IT'S EVEN MORE SINCE 8% SO YOU CAN TALK ABOUT EMISSIONS AND USING BRING BACK FROM AN OF ACTION BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ENSURE THAT. BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS GRADUATE AND GET THAT EDUCATION THAT'S A CONVERSATION. THAT WE NEED TO BE HAPPENED WE NEED TO GO EVEN DEEPER. BUT LET'S TAKE EVEN TO THE NEXT LEVEL BECAUSE THIS STARTS WAY BEFORE. HIGHER EDUCATION. NOW IS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAYS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU WHERE YOU LIVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE IS. IN OUR CASE THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM. RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS RACIAL DISPARITIES. AND SOME OF US HAVE ADVOCATED FOR REFORMS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THAT VERY ISSUE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW. NINE MINORITY STUDENTS. STOOD UP AND BROUGHT A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS IN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND THIS STATE GOVERNMENT FOUGHT THEM TOOTH AND NAIL IN THE REGARD VERSUS- CALIFORNIA DECISION. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN FOUGHT THEM TOOTH AND NAIL. SAY NO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THOSE SYSTEMS IN PLACE. AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION BROUGHT HER OWN LEGISLATION SAYING WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE TENURE FOR EXAMPLE. AND THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY KILLED THAT LEGISLATION. THE CHANGES THAT MINORITY STUDENTS ARE BRINGING TO US SAYING PLEASE CHANGE THESE THINGS. THE GIVE US BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT'S NOT WHERE IS IT CODE IS THAT IS NOT MY RACE. THE DETERMINES MY SUCCESS IN MY ABILITY TO GET AN EDUCATION THE THINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT TO US THIS BODY. KILLED IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MAJORITY SAID NO. SO IT'S A LOT DEEPER. THEN JUST TALKING ABOUT PROP TWO OH NINE. IT'S TALKIN ABOUT A FIRST IN FIRST OUT POLICY THT WE HAVE FOR TEACHERS. IS TALKING ABOUT IN LA UNIFIED IN THAT TRIAL. EXPERT WITNESSES TESTIFIED. THE BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS WERE. MANY TIMES OVER PERCENTAGE WAS LIKELY. TO BE TAUGHT BY A TEACHER IN THE 5% EFFECTIVENESS RATE THIRTY SECOND LOWEST 5% I'LL GIVE YOU THE STATS AFRICAN AMERICANS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WERE 43% MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE STUDENTS TO BE TAUGHT BY A TEACHER IN THE BOTTOM FIVE PERCENT. LATINO STUDENTS ARE 68% MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A TEACHER IN THE BOTTOM 5% OF EFFECTIVENESS IN LA UNIFIED THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND THAT'S IN THAT IS SHOWING ITSELF. ALL THE WAY UP AND WAY BEFORE WE GET TO HIGHER EDUCATION WAY BEFORE WE GET TO ADMISSIONS. SO THIS BODY NEEDS A START DOING THINGS ABOUT THIS AND IT'S HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. AND DON'T TELL ME TODAY THAT IS TWO OH NINE IF YOU'RE NOT ON BOARD WAS GET RID A TWO OH NINE YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TRYING TO GET EQUITY IN EDUCATION BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. PLEASE CAN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT IN THIS SPOT. AND I WOULD SAY LET'S HAVE LET'S CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION IS MUCH NEEDED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE WHAT'S HAPPENED. FOR US TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS BUT LET'S LET'S REALLY GET TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH EDUCATION THE RACIAL DISPARITIES WERE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY I'M READY TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT. WHAT'S A COVER UP OF THOSE ISSUES OF THE SAME WHAT'S ABOUT TO AN IRA LET'S ELIMINATE THAT LET'S GET TO THE ROOT. CAUSES OF THIS ISSUE THANK YOU MEMBERS THERE WAS GALLAGHER MR MCCARTY IN THE REAR CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW IT REALLY IS TIME FOR THIS CONVERSATION. I'VE BEEN WAITING TO VOTE ON THIS FOR AGAIN FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS. I'VE AWAITING A VOTE ON THIS AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SINCE THE DAY I GOT ELECTED SIX YEARS AGO I KNEW IT'S TIME. CON I THINK IT'S ABOUT I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM IS NICOLAS JUST NORTH OF MY DISTRICT. HAS STRONG OPINIONS AS WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE EIGHTY OPINIONS HERE THERE ARE NEARLY TWENTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DESERVE A RIGHT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM ENCINO SAID. MAYBE ONCE IN A GENERATION PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE ON SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT. WHICH ALSO I FIND. AN ACHE. AND SOMEWHAT HYPOCRITICAL IS THIS MEASURE BEFORE WAS LET'S PUT ON BY A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. KNOWS AGAINST US. DON'T ASK TO HAVE A VOTE. SO WASN'T LEGISLATURE THAT PUT THIS POLICY THE FACT IT WAS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY GOT A CHANCE TO VOTE ON IT AT THE BALLOT. SO WHY NOT JUST LET US HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GO OUT AGAIN. YOU KNOW I WANT TO FOCUS ON A FEW SECONDS OF WHAT THIS. BILL AND THIS MEASURE BEFORE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WON'T DO. IT WON'T BRING QUOTAS AROUND AND YOU HERE THE RHETORIC. ABOUT WHAT IT WILL DO AND THAT'S JUST FLAT OUT FALSE THE SUPREME COURT. RULED ON THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT'S THE LEGAL IT WON'T HAPPEN. IN CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW IT WON'T HAPPEN IN. WITH OUR UC ADMISSIONS WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS NOT THE POLICY. THIS STATES THAT RACE WILL BE A CONSIDERATION A FACTOR. AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME REAL. IMPLICATIONS FOR ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS IN CALIFORNIA. HIGHER EDUCATION COLLEGE ACCESS. TO OUR SCHOOLS. THROUGH THE WITH REGARD TO YOU. ALL OF. THEY'VE REFORM THEIR ADMISSIONS POLICIES OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AFTER PROP TWO NINE. THE REPEAL PROP THREE FIELD THE MEASURES. WITH SP ONE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WE NOW HAVE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW. PUBLIC REVIEW OF CASES WITH A LOOK AT ALL THESE FACTORS AND SO. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE THIS QUARTER SYSTEM IN PLACE. REALLY CHANGING THE PROCESS HOW TO GET THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE NOW HAVE. THE TAX AS FAR AS I ELIGIBLE THE LOCAL CONTEXT IF YOU'RE IN YOUR- RAP. A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL YOU GET A MINUTE. FOR THAT THERE'S NOT GONNA BE QUITE AS WHO GETS IN AND WHO DOESN'T FOR YOU SEE. BUT THIS WHAT THIS WILL DO IT'LL SEND A HUGE MASSES AS FAR AS WELCOMING TO UC CAMPUSES. AFRICAN AMERICAN ROME IS ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG NOT NOT WELCOME SIGN. WE HAVE A TALENT DRAIN THAT GOES TO SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. EAST COAST SCHOOLS TO HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES ACROSS THE SOUTH. TALENT LEAVES CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE A ON WELCOME SIGN AND FORTUNATELY. SO THIS WILL SEND A MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA ONCE AND VALUES EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY TO SIXTY. WE HAVE TWO MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATES IN CALIFORNIA FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW WE NEED MORE PEOPLE GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE OF ALL OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT MEANS HAVING FACULTY THAT REFLECT OUR COMMUNITY. THEY ARE RIGHT NOW WITH HIGHER DO FACULTY AT UC AND CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. REYES CAN'T BE A CONSIDERATION. THIS WILL CERTAINLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. AS MY COLLEAGUE TO MEET NICHOLAS AS WE DO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT WE HAVE THE- GRADUATION RATES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. FOR BROWN TO BLACK STUDENTS IS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS FOR OTHERS SO WHAT WITH THIS ALLOWS TO DO. HAVE RACE BASED REMEDIES THAT WE KNOW WORK RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE ILLEGAL AND THEIR THEIR THE MANY THE CAMPUSES ARE AFRAID OF BEING SUED. SO THEY CAN'T GO AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND HOW WILL THAT HELP S THAT WOULD MEAN MORE PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THE UC AND CSU IN FOUR YEARS. BRING UP SPOTS FOR ALL OF THE BROTHER CALIFORNIANS AND DEALING WITH OUR NEEDS AS FAR AS- HIGHER EDUCATION GRADUATES BILL THE JOBS IT TODAY. FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS MY COLLEAGUES SAN DIEGO THE AUTHOR IS MEASURE MINUS LAST YEAR THE BLACK MINDS MATTER WE HAD TREMENDOUS RESEARCH TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE ACHIEVEMENT OPPORTUNITY GAP WE GIVE OUT MONIES FOR ELSE YET THAT FORMULATION BASED UPON HI NEAT. ANYTIME SCHOOL DISTRICTS COME UP WITH COME UP WITH THE REMEDIES BUT THEY CAN'T IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS BECAUSE- THEY CAN'T FOCUS ON RACE AND EVEN KNOW THEY KNOW THOSE PROGRAMS WOULD BE PROPER INTERVENTIONS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO WE KNOW THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REMEDIES AND SOLUTIONS WE CAN ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE BECAUSE WERE HELD BACK BECAUSE OF PROP TWO NINE. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO GO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO WEAR. WHAT MANY PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BENEFITTED FROM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. MY FAMILY MY FATHER GOT HIS FIRST JOB HERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS AN ATTORNEY RIGHT DOWN THE STREET THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND HE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY. AND MANY PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE THE SAME AND FOR THE LAST TWENTY FOUR YEARS WE ELIMINATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. AND WE KNOW THIS ISN'T IT I SEE. I HOPE WITH PASSES I'M GONNA BUT FOR TODAY UP THE VOTERS. WEIGH IN AS WELL IN A FEW MONTHS THIRTY SECONDS THERE ARE STATES ACROSS OUR NATION THAT HAVE THESE POLICIES AND THEY HAVE THEIR TROUBLES TO THE WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT RACE DOESN'T MATTER. AND GOVERNMENT POLICY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND ACKNOWLEDGING RACIAL INEQUALITY IT'S IMPORTANT STEP CALIFORNIA TAKE TO TAKE UP. THANK YOU JUST BE. THANK YOU. MS CALL SILVA. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS WE'VE HEARD A LOT ON THE FLOOR TODAY ABOUT A CA FIVE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I WAS HERE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THIS CONVERSATION CAME UP AND IT WAS QUITE A CONVERSATION THERE WAS NOT AN AGREEMENT AND IT ACTUALLY CAUSED QUITE A BIT OF I THINK FROM FRUSTRATION. TO THE AUTHOR DR SHIRLEY WEBER BECAUSE WE COULD NOT GET THAT UP ON THE FLOOR IT WAS ACTUALLY TABLE. AND NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY WE STAND HERE WITH THIS ON THE FLOOR. AND I DID WASN'T READY TO JUMP IN AS I'VE SAID A FEW TIMES ON THIS FLOOR THESE ARE DIFFICULT VOTES THESE ARE TOUGH VOTES AND IN MY DISTRICT I'VE SEEN MORE THAN A FEW TIMES. WHEN YOU TAKE A VOTE THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE. AND I HAVE RECEIVED MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF LETTERS TO SAY DO NOT SUPPORT A CA FIVE MATTER FACT THE LEADING OF. PERSON IN MY DISTRICT WROTE THESE DON'T VOTE ON A CA FIVE THAT IS A RACIST POLICY. I RECEIVED MANY. RESPONSES SAYING THIS LETS PEOPLE GET AHEAD OF SOMEONE ELSE WHEN THEY DON'T DESERVE IT. BUT I'M GONNA QUICKLY SHARE A FEW OF MY STORIES IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX I WAS THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD WITH THREE YOUNG CHILDREN SEVEN YEARS OLD SIX YEARS OLD AND A THREE YEAR OLD AND A CLASSROOM TEACHER I HAD BEEN TEACHING FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS BY THAT TIME AND RIGHT AFTER PROP TWO NINE I WENT BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. AND ARE BILINGUAL PROGRAMS WERE DISMANTLED. SO WITH IN A SHORT FEW MONTHS. CHILDREN THAT WERE IN BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. THAT WERE LEARNING THAT WAY THOSE PROGRAMS WERE DISMANTLED WE HAD BEEN TRAINED IN VARIOUS PRACTICES THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEY WERE JUST RACED. WITH THAT BEING SAID IF YOU WERE A PERSON OF COLOR PARTICULARLY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD ORANGE COUNTY FULLER TEN WE WERE TRACKED WE WERE TRAPPED RIGHT INTO BILINGUAL PROGRAMS WHETHER WE WERE BI LINGUAL OR NOT. AND THAT MEANT USUALLY NOT AN OPTION FOR COLLEGE I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT MANY OF MY COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL. DID YOU EVEN THINK THAT I WAS A CANDIDATE. AS I CAME FROM A FAMILY OF TEN AND UP NOBODY IN MY FAMILY HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE BEFORE BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE WERE OFTEN DISCOUNTED HOUSING POLICIES IN MY AREA LATINO FAMILY OWNS WORK UP PUSHED INTO ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THAT WAS A POLICY AT THAT TIME SO WHEN WE LOOK TO NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS POLICY THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EQUITY. AND EQUALITY AND THAT IS SO HARD FOR PEOPLE. THEY REALLY WANT EVERYTHING TO BE FAIR.

THAT YOUR ACCESS AND YOUR OPPORTUNITY IS EQUAL BECAUSE YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EQUAL. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A LIE. THAT IS A LIE. AND TO CLING TO THAT LINE. IS TO ABDICATE. THE MORAL WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO. TO CONFRONT. THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS OKAY TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT NOT EVERYONE WAS BORN UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. IT IS NOT OKAY. TO DENY. ACCESS OPPORTUNITY A SPACE BECAUSE OF THAT. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO PAY SOMEONE AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE. THEN IT IS TO GET HONEST AND UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. KING SAID.

FIVE THANK YOU MISS GIVE SAID. MR MAYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. ARE WE ON WELL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- WASN'T SURE I WAS GONNA STAND UP BUT TODAY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THIS- VICTOR WASN'T SURE WE'RE GONNA TAKE UP ISSUES LIKE LIKE THIS- BECAUSE OF COVERT ABOUT YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH MOSTLY COVERED RELATED- LATED ITEMS AND HAD A CONVERSATION JUST LAST WEEK WITH OF THE AUTHOR AND SHE SAID HEY CHAD WHERE YOU OUT AN ACA FIVE AND I SAID HA. WHAT'S THAT. NOAH AND WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A- OF A CONVERSATION I SAID MY SAID TO THE AUTHOR GIVE ME. THE WEEKEND LET ME SPEND A LITTLE BIT TIME DIGGING IN AND- AND I'VE I'VE GONE FROM- THINKING I WASN'T EASY NO. TO BEING A HARD YES TO. THE I DON'T KNOW. A TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. OVER THE WEEKEND I READ THE LANGUAGE OF PROP TWO OH NINE IF IT'S OKAY MISTER SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH WHICH IS REALLY THE HEART OF THE- OF THE PROPOSITION IS WITHOUT OBJECTION. SAYS THE STATE SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR GRANT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO ANY INDIVIDUAL GROUP ON THE BASIS OF RACE SEX. COLOR ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN IN THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT PUBLIC EDUCATION OR PUBLIC CONTRACTING. SO I'M FOR FORTY THREE YEARS OLD IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT NOW BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT ME BEING THE YOUNG GUY IN THE ROOM- SO I WASN'T I'M NOT FORTY ONE- IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX I WOULD HAVE BEEN. A NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND I AM. ALMOST CERTAIN THAT WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I VOTED IN FAVOR OF THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE WHERE I COME FROM I WANTED TO BELIEVE I STILL WANT TO BELIEVE- THAT WE LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND A WORLD- AND THAT WE- THERE IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL I WANTED TO BELIEVE LIKE. ALL OF YOU HEARD ME SING A FEW YEARS AGO OF THE- THE COURSE THAT WE SAYING WHEN I WAS IN. IN IN SUNDAY SCHOOL RED AND YELLOW BLACK AND WHITE THEY ARE PRECIOUS IN HIS SIGHT THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL WANT TO LEAVE AT THEN I VOTED FOR IT THAT. THAT IS ALMOST TWENTY. YEARS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE AT WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AS A SOCIETY IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. RACE DOES MATTER. WE'RE BEYOND FIFTY YEARS PASSED THE NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE I DID WASN'T CUTTING GROUP GROPE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THAT WAS WAS ALL ABOUT I WAS BORN IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND FOR ME I DIDN'T SEE ALL OF THOSE THOSE THINGS. BUT WHEN I WAS NINETEEN I HAD HOPED THAT WE HAD GOTTEN BEYOND ALL OF THAT AND THE TRUTH IS TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE WE ARE NOT BEYOND THAT AND THE FACT IS IT HAS BEEN. A GENERATION. BEFORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO STAND UP. AND PINE ON THIS. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS BODY FROM TIME TO TIME LOOKING AT OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. TO PUT THOSE QUESTIONS BACK BEFORE THE VOTERS AND SAY IS THIS STILL WHAT YOU WANT. TO BE IN YOUR CONSTITUTION. AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK IT IS MORE THAN APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SEND THIS ACA FIVE TO BE ABLE TO GET ON THE BALLOT. IN NOVEMBER AND ASK THIS QUESTION OF WHERE THE CALIFORNIANS WANT TO MOVE IN THE FUTURE. IF WE JUST LISTEN AND I GUESS IS THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD WANT TO SAY IS WE'VE BEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THIS EVERYONE SAYS- I'VE GOT THE ANSWERS BECAUSE WHEN I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS YOU HAVE ASKED ME THEN I WAS THE SMARTEST GUY THAT I KNEW- STE SOME OF YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SAY THAT CHECK GIVEN CHANGE MUCH. FROM A BUT- BUT WHAT I REALIZE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER YOU TRULY LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER. LIKE AT THE TONE OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY. YOUR REALIZE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE ALL HAVE- ARE VALUABLE. AND I WOULD SAY AS THE MAJORITY OF HIS BODY HAS SAID AND I BELIEVE IT'S GONNA BE SUPER MAJORITIES BODIES SAID. IT'S TIME TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS TIME TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO THE TO OPINE ON THIS. AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES THAT ARE. BEING REPRESENTED IN OUR DISCUSSION TODAY YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE ARE THE MOST. DIVERSE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND I. I THINK WE TRULY BENEFIT. FROM THIS DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES. AND I THINK THAT THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE- FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. TO ENSURE THE RICHNESS OF. DEBATE OF CA OF CONVERSATIONS ESPECIALLY A PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS BY HAVING SUCH A BROAD RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES. BEING REPRESENTED. I WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. I THINK A- YOU KNOW RECENT EVENTS ARE CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE CORONAVIRUSES HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD ANOTHER YOUNG BLACK MEN IS CLEARLY SHOWED. THAT WE STILL LIVE IN A RACIST AND SEXIST SOCIETY. AND I WOULD AGREE WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW RACE STILL MATTERS GENDER SO MATTERS. AND THAT WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS REALITY. BY OPENLY CONSIDERING RATHER THAN PRETENDING. THAT WE LIVE IN A COLOR BLIND AND GENDER NEUTRAL SOCIETY THAT WE DO NEED TO OPENLY. CONSIDER RACE AND GENDER. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE VOICES THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD IN THIS DEBATE AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE VOICES. AND THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN DONE JUSTICE IN OUR CONVERSATION THUS FAR AND SO I WANT TO. RAISE A VOICE FOR. MANY NOT ALL BECAUSE THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS EXTREMELY DIVERSE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD IN THIS DEBATE. ASIAN AMERICANS EVEN DURING THIS CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC I MEAN WE HAVE EXPERIENCED RACISM WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. THE VICTIMS OF MORE HATE CRIMES BECAUSE OF OUR PRESIDENT THAT CALLS THIS. THE WUHAN VIRUS THE CHINESE VIRUS. THAT A JAPANESE GUY LIKE ME IS GETTING ATTACKED OR YOU KNOW AT RISK OF BEING ATTACKED BECAUSE IN THE EYES OF SO MANY AMERICANS WE ALL LOOK THE SAME. ASIAN AMERICAN THIS IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HOW ASIAN AMERICANS ARE NOT. IMMUNE FROM RACISM HERE AND NOW AND OF COURSE ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN. ARE JUST AS MUCH VICTIMS OF SEXISM. IF NOT MORE. AND SO THAT IS THE REASON WHY. THE MAJORITY OF ASIAN AMERICANS SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT WE SUPPORT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S- DONE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS THAT DOESN'T UNFAIRLY. LIMIT OR EXCLUDE. IN A MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. IN THE PRACTICE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. ASIAN AMERICANS ARE DIVERSE AMMANAI AT THE RISK OF ENGAGING IN STEREOTYPES A MAN WE HAVE A WEALTHY RECENT IMMIGRANTS FROM CHINA. WE HAVE FOURTH GENERATION JAPANESE AMERICANS LIVING IN MIDDLE CLASS SUBURBS WE HAVE COLLEGE EDUCATED KOREANS AND SOUTH ASIAN IMMIGRANTS WORKING IN GROCERY STORES THIRTY SECONDS. AND YET THE ONE THING THAT BRINGS ALL ASIAN AMERICANS TOGETHER IS. THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AS YOU KNOW THE TICKET FOR OUR CHILDREN TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THERE IS A WIDELY HELD PERCEPTION AMONG MANY ASIANS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK HARDER AND GET BETTER GRADES AND HIGHER TEST SCORES TO GET INTO THE MOST COMPETITIVE SCHOOLS IN OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT. THAT PERCEPTION CONTINUES TO GET HAVE SOME SUPPORT. IN THE DATA THAT I RECEIVED RECENTLY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I MEAN ADMISSION RATES FOR ALL GROUPS HAVE DROPPED BECAUSE THE APPLICATIONS. HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS EVER SINCE PROP TWO OH NINE PASS PLEASE INCLUDE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IS THAT. ASIAN AMERICANS JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE. WE ARE SEEKING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. WE WANT. TO BE TREATED FAIRLY. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IF DONE RIGHT. IT IS TO PROMOTE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERSITY FOR ALL. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT THE REPEAL OF PROPOSITION TWO OR NINE. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. WORKS FOR ALL COMMUNITIES AND THAT DOES NOT. UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYONE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER COOPER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ACTUALLY HADN'T PLANNED ON TALKING BUT I AM VOTING TO SUPPORT OF ACA FIVE I DON'T THINK THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO- SHOULD TAKES THE EASY ROAD AND- I APPRECIATE THAT BUT- IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH DOING YOUR WHEN THE HARDWORKING MEMBERS I KNOW- THE MILL MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO WHEN HE SPOKE AND IT REALLY TOUCHED ME WE SAID HIS PARENTS TOLD THEM LET'S NOT FOR YOU GOT WORK TWICE AS HARD. MY MOM TOLD ME THE SAME THING SO THINK ABOUT THAT WHY WOULD APPEAR EVER TELL THEIR CHILD THAT LIFE IS NOT FAIR YOU HAVE TO WORK TWICE AS HARD AS EVERYBODY ELSE I HAVE FOUR DAUGHTERS I TOLD THE SAME THING THAT'S REALITY PEOPLE FACE IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF SIXTY FOUR VOTING RIGHTS ACT THE SIXTY FIVE I WAS BORN IN SIXTY FOUR A FIFTY SIX MY DOZEN MILITARY IN FRANCE MY FAMILY'S OVER THERE. AND HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO VOTE BEFORE THEN. GOOD MISSISSIPPI. COULDN'T VOTE. SO IT'S CRAZY THINGS GO ON. IN THINK A- THIS IS TO LET THE VOTER VOTE. DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAT WE'RE NOT THIS IS. THEY'RE MAKING. IN A RICE TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. WITH LOW ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE EVERYBODY ELSE. FOR THE API COMMUNITY SOUTHEAST ASIANS LAWFUL ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS JUST TO HAVE A CHANCE SO THINK ABOUT THAT A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. HOW MY FOUR DOLLARS HAVE A CHANCE THEIR THEIR BLACK WOMEN. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS I'VE BEEN THE PAY EQUITY BILL FOR WOMEN IN THE LEGISLATURE. INITIALLY THE BILL IS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON IT NO FOR THE BILL GETS THROUGH BUT WHO KNOWS BUT WE KELLY CHART TELLS ME COULD TAKE TEN YEARS. TO BRING UP THE PAY OF WOMEN TO MEN. IN STATE SERVICE THAT IS INSANE. THAT IS FAR TOO LONG. THINK ABOUT THAT TEN YEARS TO BRING UP. IF YOU'RE FEMALE CHIEF IN THIS BUILDING. YOU MAKE LESS THAN MIL CHIEFS DO. WHY IS THAT. I CAME FROM I REFER COUNTY FOR THIRTY YEARS IN A CITY FOR FIFTEEN. AND WHATEVER THAT CLASSIFICATION WAS MADE THE SAME PAY IN THAT JOB DESCRIPTION HERE THE CAPITAL. IT IS THE GOVERNMENT PAYS EVERYWHERE THERE'S NO EQUITY IN THE I THINK ABOUT THAT SO WILL SEEING IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. WE GOT A CHANGE THAT. IT'S EXCELLENT IT'S TOUGH TO HAVE DISCUSSION ON RACE. IS TOUGH KNOWN IT MAKES PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE OR TALK ABOUT IT. I CAN'T CHANGE COLOR OF MY SKIN I'M A BLACK MAN. BUT IT IS SOMETHING FOR THE VOTERS. TO GO VOTE SO I DON'T KNOW WHY. ANYBODY WOULD BEGRUDGE THE VOTERS TO MAKE A DECISION. THE VOTE ON THIS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO LET THEM VOTE ON IT NOW. IT IS NOT A BIG DEAL JUST MAKES SENSE. AND I REALLY BELIEVE. WE ARE AT A WATERMARK IN SOCIETY WITH THIS THERE'S SO MUCH THAT'S GOING ON. IN TO JUST BEING GATES IN OF ALL. PLACES LAWMAKERS EVER ELECTED WE VOTE ALL THE TIME TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS. BUT THIS IS THE CHANCE WE GET TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. MAKE THE CHOICE LET THEM HAVE A CHOICE I SUPPORT THIS AND URGES SUPPORT A CA FIVE. THANK YOU MISS COOPER MISS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBER SINCE THE ELDER MILLENNIAL CAUCUSES IS ADMITTING THEIR AGES I'LL SHARE THAT I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY I WILL BE FORTY IN AUGUST. THE YEAR THAT I WAS BORN IS THE YEAR THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN INVESTING IN THE PRISON SYSTEM. IN TWO YEARS PRIOR THROUGH PROP THIRTEEN BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THE FUNDING PUBLIC EDUCATION. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. THE STATE HAS BUILT MORE THAN TWENTY NEW PRESENCE AND ONLY THREE CS USE. IT IS MY GENERATION OF STUDENTS. AND THOSE THAT FOLLOWED THAT HAPPENED FUNNELED THROUGH A VERY REAL SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. I ATTENDED ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE HEIGHTS MY HIGH SCHOOL HAD FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS THREE DIFFERENT TRACKS. I HAVE SHARED IN THE PAST THAT IN ELEVENTH GRADE I DROPPED OUT. BUT IWAS LUCKY. THAT I HAD THE SUPPORT OF MY HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL WHOM WE'VE HONORED ON THIS FLOOR. MISTRUST KEEL AND I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME AND WITH MY CLASS. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT I PROBABLY WALKED SHRINE AUDITORIUM IN LOS ANGELES AND MY RED CAP AND GOWN. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MOMENT OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. AT THE TIME I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TWO YEARS PRIOR WHEN I WAS JUST SIXTEEN. THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCT PASSED PROP TWO OH NINE. REMOVING ANY OPPORTUNITY I WOULD HAVE HAD IN ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT TO BE AN IMMIGRANT TO BE FORMALLY UNDOCUMENTED TO BE AN ENGLISH LEARNER TO COME FROM A LOW INCOME FAMILY OR WHAT IT MEANT TO GROW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD RIDDLED WITH GANG VIOLENCE AND LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS. AFTER GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL A FEW YEARS LATER. I MADE MY WAY THROUGH EAST LA COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEW YEARS LATER CAL STATE LA. AND A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT U. S. C. FOR GRAD SCHOOL. IT WORKED THE ENTIRE TIME. AND OFTEN PAID FOR BOOKS I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO READ. I AM A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN. THE FIRST ONE IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THERE ARE SO MANY MORE LIKE ME. WHO DESERVE ENOUGH WHICH AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH OUR FULL POTENTIAL. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR HER DECADES LONG FIGHT FOR KIDS LIKE ME. THANK YOU. I AM A PRODUCT DOCTOR WEBER OF YOUR FLIGHT. THERE IS A NEW GENERATION OF CALIFORNIANS WHOSE VOICE SHOULD BE HEARD WHO BELIEVE THE PROP TWO ONE NINE WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE BAD POLICY. WHO WANT TO PROVIDE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. MEMBERS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE ON AC A FIVE AND ALLOW THE VOTERS OF OUR STATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA UP TO DATE. AND THE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA UP TOMORROW THAT IS DESERVING OF THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THE CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO. MISTER LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- I WON'T OF REFLECT BACK ON NINETEEN NINETY SIX AS A PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE DONE SO AS A LONG TIME AGO I WAS STILL DATING WOMEN BACK THEN- AND THAT WAS VERY VERY LONG TIME AGO- SO WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT MUCH HAS CHANGED. OKAY SO BUT NOW THAT I GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY. I STAND YOU WITH SIGNIFICANT MIXED EMOTION. OF SADNESS. A DEEP ANGER FRUSTRATION. IN CONFLICT. YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THIS NOTION ABOUT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER JUSTICE FOR ALL. NINETY BELIEVE IN THAT JUSTICE IS ONE JUSTICE TO ALL. BUT WE MUST DO THAT COLLECTIVELY. AND THIS IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE BUT IT NEEDS TO BE HAD BECAUSE WE ARE A MICROCOSM OF OUR ELECTRIC. AND IT CAN'T IT BE DONE IN ISOLATION. YOUR HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR THAT THIS LEGISLATION HAS GREAT SUPPORT FROM MANY CAUCUSES. NO THAT ONE CAUCUS THAT'S MISSING. THE API CAUCUS. WHY WE'RE NOT HAVING A FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. WHY IS THERE SUCH RESISTANCE WHY IS NOT A SINGLE A PACK CAUCUS MEMBER A CO AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE OF THIS DEEP. FEAR THAT WE WILL LOSE THAT WE WILL LOSE SEATS. AND HOW DO WE RECONCILE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT DEEP PAIN AND RACE AND CHALLENGES THAT EXIST THROUGH DIALOGUE. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THERE IS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE ABSENCE OF THAT DIALOGUE. COLLEAGUES I WAS NOT EVEN GIVING THE DIGNITY NOT GIVEN THE DIGNITY. OF HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THIS THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS HAS NOT COME TO ME TO ASK ME FOR MY VOTE. NOT A TEXT MESSAGE ALL NOT A MEDIA REQUEST NOTHING. AND THAT IS EMBLEMATIC A PART OF THIS PROBLEM. WE CAN'T DO THIS IN ISOLATION. YES WE HAVE A MORAL COMPASS. WE MUST HAVE CONVERSATIONS DIFFICULT ONES EVEN WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES IN OPPOSITION. BECAUSE ALL THIS TOGETHER RIGHT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND LET'S THINK ABOUT SORT OF THIS MITCHELL. AN UNCONDITIONAL ALLY SHIP IT IS MUTUAL IT IS TO WAIT. AND I SHARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS BECAUSE- I WAS IT JUST DIRECTOR FOR PAUL FONG WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS WHEN THIS FIRST CAME ABOUT. WHO BY THE WAY SUBSEQUENTLY LOST HIS NEXT ELECTION BECAUSE OF THIS VOTE. SO DOES COME POLITICAL PERIL. BUT I DO NOT RUN FOR OFFICE FOR SELF PRESERVATION. BUT I BEGIN TO WONDER THEN WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY IN MY COMMUNITY ARE IN OPPOSITION. AREN'T YOU YELLOW. WHY ARE YOU VOTING AGAINST YOUR OWN PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU PORTRAYING US. THESE ARE FROM SITTING ELECTED OFFICIALS TELLING THIS IN MY DISTRICT AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THIS WAS TRUE OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. BECAUSE I'VE HAD NINETY NINE CALLS AND EMAILS IN SUPPORT. AND A WHOPPING THREE THOUSAND AND SEVEN HUNDRED IN OPPOSITION. THIRTY SEVEN TO ONE. YOU MIGHT THINK OKAY THEY'RE OUT OF THE DISTRICT WEISSMAN SOMETIMES LIKE LOOK ABSOLUTELY THE REGISTERED VOTERS THE REAL PEOPLE. REAL OPPOSITION SO ONE OF MY TO DO. WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THE DECENCY OF A CONVERSATION TO DISCUSS DIFFICULTIES OF RACE. AND THIS INSTITUTION. HAS THE MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND IF WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE THESE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE ELECTORATE. IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO BE TALKING IN ISOLATION. SO WHY IS THIS. THE CASE. IT'S ABOUT POWER IT'S ABOUT FEARS ABOUT RACE ABOUT THE LOSS OF POWER AGE WAS ROUNDER'S PARTICULAR THE CHINESE COMMUNITY FEAR THE LOSS OF GOOD HARD WORKING PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU DO THE HARD WORK AS YOUR TOLD. THEY WILL HAVE THE CHANCE AS WELL TO. MANY OF THEM GOING TO DEBT BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION THAT'S A CULTURAL THING. SO IF WE UNDERSTAND. THE REALITIES NO ASIAN BECAUSE OF UNDER CAUCUS SUPPORT OUR AS AUTHORS CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL THE CLOCK IS MISSING AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE EIGHT YEARS AGO NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE CONVERSATIONS. SO WHY IS THAT THE CASE THAT SO MANY BELIEVE THIS. MANY IN THE COMMUNITY ARE RECENT IMMIGRANTS. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY DON'T SEND THE CHALLENGES OF OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHY BY THE WAY WE NEED MANDATORY ETHNIC STUDIES SO WE CAN LEARN ABOUT THE HISTORY OF ALL OF US AS A CULTURE SO YOU REMEMBER THE UNCANNY PARALLELS WITH THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT LAW OF NINETEEN THIRTEEN WHICH FOR BID ASIAN AMERICANS FROM. OWNING PROPERTY. OR EVEN IN MY COMMITTEE. THE DISCRIMINATION WITH PROPOSITION EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WHICH ELIMINATE THE RIGHTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES TO MARRY. AND THE MESSAGE IS ACTUALLY REALLY CLEAR TO ASIA PROVIDERS YOU WANT THE BEST WAY TO GET. YOUR CHILD YOUR KID AND HIGHER EDUCATION GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE HAVE PROPERTY TRANSFERS. AND BY THE WAY AT THE END OF COMMITTEE CALL IT'S LIKE MINE IN MY COMMUNITY 79% TRANSFER RATES THE UC SYSTEM THAT'S THE BEST WAY. TO GET IT. SO ABSOLUTELY IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TALK ABOUT. THESE CONVERSATIONS THESE ISSUES. IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE RACE NEUTRAL POLICIES FOR VERY VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. THIRTY SECONDS MR LOW. AND SO TODAY MY VOTE WILL BE BASED SOLELY ON MY CONSCIENCE AND MY COMMITMENT TO MY CONVICTION AND AS WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION TODAY WITH THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. TECHNICIAN LOW THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER SPEAKER YOUR RECOGNITION OR THE CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR A VIGOROUS- DEBATE TODAY- PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE ALONG WITH PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WITH THE TWO- MOMENTS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY THAT REALLY LED TO MY POLITICAL. AWAKENING TODAY I THOUGHT BOTH WERE BAD IDEAS AND I THINK- I STILL THINK BOTH ARE BAD IDEAS. TODAY THANKS TO THE AUTHOR WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT ONE OF THOSE TWO VERY BAD IDEAS. AND TODAY IS BEYOND TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. REALITY IS FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH THOSE WHO HOLDING GRAIN MISCONCEPTIONS OF RACE AND GENDER RELATIONS. WE KNOW NOW THAT SAYING WE ARE RACE COLOR BLIND IS THE SAME AS SAYING WE ARE BLIND TO HISTORY. THE SAME WAY THAT SO MANY HAVE BEEN BLIND TO POLICE BRUTALITY. TO SAY THAT FEMINISM MEANS TREATING WOMEN EXACTLY THE SAME AS MEN. IS THE DENIAL OF THE LONG TIME AFFECTS. A TURKEY. WE CAN LEARN FROM THE PAST. AND WE MUST KEEP LEARNING. EACH OF US CAME INTO THIS WORLD WITH THE SAME INTRINSIC VALUE. BUT SOCIAL NORMS AN IMPLICIT BIAS HAVE TIPPED THE SCALES AGAINST US AND WE HAVE SEEN RESEARCH OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT BEARS THIS OUT. WE MUST ALLOW FOR SOLUTIONS. THAT PROVIDE A COUNTERBALANCE TO UNFAIR ADVANTAGES. WE CAN BE FAIR. WE CAN DIGEST WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. BUT PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE STANDS IN OUR WAY. I ASK YOUR RIVALS RACY ACA FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND THANKS TO SO MANY OF YOU WHO HAVE STOOD IN SPOKEN TODAY AND- HAVE EXPRESSED YOUR CONCERN OF YOUR INTERESTS THE IN THIS. WE BEGIN BY FIRST OF ALL SAYING THAT IT WAS NOT MY DESIRE TO BE THE PRIMARY AUTHOR ON A CA FIVE. OF IT WAS A GROUP THING AND I HOPE THAT SOMEONE ELSE WOULD BASICALLY LEAD THE CHARGE BECAUSE I WOULD WAS EXHAUSTED FROM LAST YEAR FROM THREE NINE TWO AND SO I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER TO CHEER THIS IT WAS A GROUP THING THAT WE MET WITH COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS AND SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER PEOPLE JUST ASSUMED THAT I WAS THE MAIN AUTHOR. AND AS A RESULT MY NAME COMES FIRST EVEN ONE LAST IN THE ALPHABET. WITH REGARD TO THIS. SO FOR WHATEVER REASON A IT WAS NOT MY INTENT TO DO THAT. I WHEN I BEGAN MY PRESENTATION TODAY I WAS GOING TO APOLOGIZE TO MANY OF YOU. BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY STRATEGY GENERALLY IS TO TALK TO PEOPLE. TO TRY TO GET TO YOU TO GET TO YOUR OFFICE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOU I WAS NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. MAINLY BECAUSE WE WERE QUARANTINED AND WE WERE HERE AND WE WERE THERE AND TIME WAS RUNNING OUT AND SO WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. AND I HAD TO RELY UPON OTHERS TO DO SOME OF THE CONVERSATION FOR ME. THE API COMMUNITY CHOSE THE CAUCUS CHOSE TO DO ITS OWN CONVERSATION WITH ITS MEMBERS. AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY HEAR FROM ME. BUT YOUR OWN MEMBERS CHOSE TO DO THAT. AND THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THE LATINO CAUCUS. BECAUSE THERE WERE ALL THESE CAUCUSES IN EACH ONE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO GET ENGAGE WITH THEIR PERSONS. AND COME BACK TO ME AND TELL ME WHERE THEY WORK. THE LAST I HEARD WAS I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MEETING ORGANIZED WITH YOU. THE MISTER GIBSON I BELIEVE IT WAS. AND SOME OTHERS AND SO IT WAS NOT THAT I WAS IGNORING YOU IS THAT WE HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME COMING BACK. AND SO VERY FEW OF YOU I HAD REALLY A CHANCE TO REACH OUT TO. AND I GOT THE INFORMATION FROM OTHERS AND EVENTUALLY. GOT FOUND OUT WHERE PEOPLE WERE WITH REGARD TO SOMEONE APOLOGIZE AS I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE- MY STRATEGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO MEET IF YOU INDIVIDUALLY. AND SO THAT WAS THEN BEING TOLD WHO POTENTIALLY I NEEDED TO CALL. BECAUSE WE WERE RUNNING TIME AND NOT BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO IGNORE ANYONE BUT I WAS GETTING INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. I SEE FOR DOES SOME OF YOU I DIDN'T REACH OUT TO. BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT GET FIFTY FOUR. AND YOU A VERY LIMITED OF TIME WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING I HAD MUCH MORE TIME WITH THREE NINE TWO. NINE THREE ONE COMBINED AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. SO LET ME THAT USE THAT SAY THAT THIS WAS NOT MY INTENT TO DO THIS. AND ONE OF THE REASONS OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO TALK ABOUT RACE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE A PERSON WHO SEES IT EVERYWHERE IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO SAY THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS THERE IT IS BECAUSE THEN YOU BECOME THE PERSON WHO'S ALWAYS SO BREAKS CONSCIOUS. PEOPLE START AVOIDING YOU DISLIKING YOU SO I TRY TO SAVE MY RACE CONVERSATIONS FOR THE REAL BIG RACE ISSUES. NOT THE LITTLE ONES BECAUSE IF YOU DO THE OTHER YOU'RE OVER PEOPLE BEGIN TO AVOID YOU. AND THEN YOU BECOME INEFFECTIVE AND YOUR ABILITY TO TEACH THEM ABOUT THE BIG THINGS AND SO I TRY NOT TO BECAUSE OF THAT AND I TRIED NOT TO ALSO BECAUSE IT'S VERY PAINFUL FOR ME. A PERSON WHO'S LIVED AS LONG AS I'VE LIVED. I'M SEVENTY ONE I'LL BE SEVENTY TWO IN SEPTEMBER. HAS LIVED AS LONG AS I LIVE. HAS SEEN SO MUCH TRY SO HARD TRY TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL WHAT I SEE IN MY CHILDREN AND MY COMMUNITY WHAT I SEE MY RELATIVES HOW I SEE THE HURT AND THE PAIN THAT THEY FEEL IN THE DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH. AND SOME PEOPLE THINK WELL YOU'VE GOT IT ALL SURELY YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT THE CAREER YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW A SUCCESSFUL LIFE YOU'VE GOT THE BIG HOUSE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE THINGS BUT I STILL HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT I STILL HAVE NEIGHBORS I SEE SICK CHILDREN AND I STILL WOULDN'T SCHOOLS WHAT I SEE THAT THERE THE FUTURE IS BLOCKED. AND I KNOW THAT BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ME. BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS IN TERMS OF THE FAMILY THE RELATIVES THAT YOU SEE. AND SO WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY YEAH I KNOW IT'S THERE BUT I WANT TO DO THIS AND I WANT TO DO THAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANTED ALL THOSE THINGS TO. AND YES WE MUST SARCHIE TO A PROBLEM. WE MUST SO THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE SAW THAT PROBLEM. BUT I'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT IN THE PROCESS OF THE STRUGGLE. BUT I CAN'T JUST DO K. TWELVE. BECAUSE INTO THE GENERATION UP YOU THIS I'M ALSO LOSING. AS I'VE GOT TO HELP THEM AS WELL. AND I'VE GOT TO HELP PEOPLE GET INTO THAT AND I'VE ALSO GOT TO HELP PEOPLE GET CONTRACTS BECAUSE- I SEE THE VISION. BEING KILLED IN THE EYES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY CAN'T GET THESE CONTRACTS OF THESE JOBS. I SEE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH- KIDS OF COLOR NOW IN A PRINT YOUR PROGRAM. SO WHEN I GO ON WORK SITES I SEE. ALMOST VERY FEW. AFRICAN A- ITS OWN. LETTING TO PRINT YOUR PROGRAM. WITH THERE IS NO. OF REACH THEM TO. INTO THE- IN SO WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION A THIS THE PEOPLE CALL ME THE CAP SAYS NO AFTER AMERICAN BILL THAT BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. AND WE HAD TO GO TO THE GOVERNOR AND WE HAVE NO PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS OF THIS DIVERSITY ON A WORK SITE. AND SO EVENTUALLY WILL REALIZE AHA THERE'S NO AFRICAN AMERICAN SO THAT WHEN FOUND THREE OF THEM WHO ARE. WELL QUALIFIED TO DO IRON WORK ON ON THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I SEE IN A DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. BUT I DO KNOW THAT WHEN I WORKED UNDER NEATH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND I SPENT THOSE YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP PEOPLE. I KNOW THAT MY PROFESSOR HELPED ME THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN ON THE CAMPUS OF UCLA I WOULD NEVER BEEN A WHICH WILL SOON FOLLOW. I WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE TO GRADUATE SCHOOL. AS IT WOULD TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE PULLING ME AWAY BUT HE WAS THERE AS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ON CAMPUS TO HELP US. NAVIGATE HE DIDN'T TAKE MY TEST HE COULD WRITE MY DISSERTATION HE COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS BUT HE COULD ENCOURAGE ME TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. HE COULD BE A ROLE MODEL FOR ME IF YOU COULD LIFT ME UP WHEN TIMES ARE DIFFICULT AS THEY TRIED TO PUT ME OUT OF SCHOOL. AND YET I HAVE A HIGH GPA IN THE DEPARTMENT GRADUATED EARLY THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AND YET THE RACISM OF THE WHITE MALE. PART AND WANTED TO DESTROY ME AND THEY MADE EVERY EFFORT TO TRY TO DO IT. AND WHAT NOT FOR THIS THIS GENTLEMAN WHO WAS A SCHOLAR. AND A ROLE MODEL FOR ME THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THAT. AND SO I HAD A COMMITMENT WHEN I BEGAN TO TEACH THAT I HAD TO OPEN THESE DOORS EVERY YOUNG PERSON I EVER SAW. TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. NOT ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS BUT I BELIEVE THE WHITE STUDENTS WHO CAME INTO MY CLASS A BETTER PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY THAT WAS IN THAT CLASSROOM. THEY HAVE FRIENDS IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THEM THAT WE COULD CHALLENGE SIMILAR FOUGHT TO MAKE AN CHALLENGE US. AND THEY GREW FROM SIMPLY BEING IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND IT MADE CALIFORNIA IT MADE A UNIVERSAL MAKE CALIFORNIA A BETTER PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO BE. SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THIS IS EVERYTHING. IT IS NOT JUST GETTING IN THE UNIVERSITY. IT'S HAVING SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHY YOU BETTER KEEP YOU THERE. IS COMMITTING A STANDARD YOU DIDN'T A RESPONSE. TO DO LIKEWISE. THAT WHEN YOU WILL HAVE A WORK SITE AND PEOPLE COME TO THAT WORKS LIKE THAT IS SO DIFFERENT. THAT'S WHAT YOU WALK ABOUT WAS HE YOU WALK OFF SINCE. YOU SEE STREET. TO THE MY THIS. BUT YOU KNOW I ALSO DID I TELL ALL MY- THAT THEY HAD A HIGH BLACKS. AND THE- IS TO. THERE IS A WHEN YOU INTO OFFICES. CUT SANDY. EVERYBODY HAS A THESE WERE BLACK. WORK AT OFFICE THAT NAY DID THE BEFORE. WHY BECAUSE THAT IS A- SO I HAD YOU TODAY TO GIVE CAL. A CHANGE. GIVE A THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THIS IS A NOT BUT JUST THAT WE GOT TO HAVE A- BUT THAT. IN A- NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT. AND THE RE. INTO FOR THIS QUE. TO BERKELEY WHEN I. MY CAN. TIME IN. IT YOU WANT TO REPEAL PROP BLOOM. THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD DO WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AND I WAS SO GRATEFUL I DIDN'T HAVE TO CONVINCE YOU THAT RACISM IS REAL BECAUSE- GEORGE FOR DID THAT. SO THAT WAS ONE CONVERSATION THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE TO ADMIT IT IS REAL. AND IT IS THERE THAT IS PRESENT AND IN THE PAST NOT JUST THE LIVES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO FIGURE OUT EVERY WAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN TO IMPACT THAT AND IT WOULD NOT BE ONE THING. TWO NINE THE REMOVING TOLD I WILL NOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MANY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA TO SAY CALIFORNIA IS THE LAND OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY. AND THOSE WHO CAME HERE IS IDEA THREE YEARS OLD THEY CAME HERE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY COULD GET BETTER THINGS YOU THAN THEY COULD IN MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA IN OTHER PLACES LIKE THAT. BUT THE SUN WAS SHINING BRIGHTER IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEIR FUTURE WOULD BE BRIGHTER AS WELL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IDLE FOR A CA FIVE.
