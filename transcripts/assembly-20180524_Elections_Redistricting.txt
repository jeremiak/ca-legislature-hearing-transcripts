I JUST WANNA I'M BRIEFLY AT KIND OF RECAP WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THIS BILL AND AND THINK SIMPLY MEMBER COURT FOR HIS. LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AS YOU RECALL THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT STEMS FROM DISCUSSION LAST YEAR ON. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FORTY ON THAT ONE PERCENT MENTAL TALLY AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE TO A MORE. A SCIENTIFICALLY BASED AUDITING OF POST ELECTION NOT IT'S THAT ADDRESSES THE OUTCOME OF THE CONTEST RATHER THAN. JUST OF THE. EFFICACY OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S USED FOR VOTING SO WHEN WE'RE HERE BEFORE HAVE WE HAD THE FIRST VERSION OF THE BILL NOW WE HAVE A VERSION OF THE BILL THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO INCLUDE. SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY ON. THOSE NOT CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE. BUT WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AND AND I THINK THERE'S STILL A STRONG COMMITMENT TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD AND SO WHY WE'RE ENCOURAGED. BY WERE RAT AND. ASK FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT YEAH รณ I SHOULD SAY THAT I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH IS A VERY GOOD ONE. ARE DIRECT THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO BALLOT GUIDELINES ON THAT REPORT. OF MISTER SHOW FOR IT HAS BEEN. I HE WAS AMONG THE FOLKS WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THE IDEA OF A RISK LEVINE AUDIT. I HAD THIS SIMPLE BILL LAST YEAR CONVENTION OF THE VOTING RIGHTS TASK FORCE AND WAS VERY. WELL IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT WRESTLING MEAN AUDITS AND. AND WE'RE HERE NOW TO DISCUSS THEM JIM DO YOU WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND JIM VEGAS INERT QUICKLY THAT'S UNCONFIRMED WITH THEM.

GROUP OF TWELVE ELECTION INTEGRITY ADVOCATES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS BILL. FEBRUARY. AND. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION AND I'M JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. BUT PAM SMITH WROTE A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE TWENTY THIRD AND I BELIEVE. MR LOGAN GOT A COPY OF THAT. BOB. AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THERE WERE NINE. TELL ME IF I'M RUNNING TOO LONG BUT. SOME OF THE COMMENTS. THIS A RISK WHEN YOU WHAT IT IS NOT ABOUT VERIFICATION OF SOFTWARE. CPO VERIFICATION OF THE RESULTS THERE IT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE. ARE. DEFINITION OF RISK WINNING AUDITS NEEDS TO BE RE WRITTEN. TO INDICATE AGAIN THAT IT'S ABOUT THE RESULT WHO'S THE WINNER THAT'S THE QUESTION NOT VERIFICATION SOFTWARE QUALITY CONTROL. WE NEED A A DEFINITION ABOUT PULLING AUDITS. IN THERE IT'S NOT IN THERE. WE NEED DE. A DEFINITION OF WHAT IS THE PARTIAL RISK WINNING AUDIT WHICH IS. WHAT HAPPENS? WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF TIME TO DO THAT THE AUDIT BECAUSE SHE WAS RUNNING OUT OF TIME. YOU COULD SAY OKAY WE THINK THIS IS SIXTY PERCENT CHAIRS THE RESULTS ARE RIGHT. AND YOU RUN WITH THAT. BUT THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF DOING THAT IN THIS BILL AT LEAST. A AS WE START WHEN PAM WROTE THE. THE LETTER. A. NOW WITH SELECTION. NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE AUDIT IT'S DEFINED SEPARATELY AND IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD TO BE. PART OF THE AUDIT. ARTS OF THAT'S. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE. FOR A. CHANGED. AND THERE'S ARE. AN ISSUE OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE OBSERVABLE. IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO REPLICATE WHAT THE SOFTWARE DID FOR COMING UP WITH THE DETERMINATION OF. WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE WE AT? WE HAVE DEAD THE SOFT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE REPLICATING COME UP WITH THE SAME ITSELF THAT IS THE PUBLIC. AMENDMENTS ANOTHER LARGER ISSUE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT GO. FIT INTO THIS BOUGHT IT'S BEEN A CONCERN. OF ELECTION INTEGRITY OBSERVERS FOR A LONG TIME. IS WERE TOLD TO GO AND OBSERVE THE COUNTS. WE CAN SEE THE BALLOTS WE CAN SEE. A PAPER AT THIS DISTANCE. I CANNOT SEE THE MARKINGS. THAT EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. ARE IN THE FINAL THING IS THE SUGGESTION OF. CREATING A LIST RISK WINNING AUDIT. TASK FORCE. COMPOSED OF OF STAKEHOLDERS. YOU GO OVER SOME OF THE TRICKY ISSUES WHICH INCLUDE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN UP AGAINST TIME LIMITS? BECAUSE YOU AT THE END OF THE CAMPUS PERIOD. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE BALLOTS THAT ARE NOT COUNTED OR IF? IT DID NOT BEEN COUNTED. BUT THEY'RE VALID BALLOTS. AND THE LETTER INCLUDES SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THEIR ART. THIS WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THAT. FORCE SET UP TO TWO. WORK WITH ALL THAT. STAKEHOLDERS. TO GET THIS RESOLVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THAT WAS FOR OR AGAINST BY. COMING. OF COMMENTARY YEAH THAT'S FINE I'M GLAD TO HAVE CHICKENS. CONTINUING THE INPUT AND WE WILL WORK ON ALL OF THESE THINGS IN THE SENATE. BOB THE SPIRIT OF WHAT HE DISCUSSES IS CERTAINLY A SPIRIT THAT I WOULD EMBRACE. BUT WE WE WERE GOOD NEED TO WORK OUT A LOT DETAILS. ANY ADDITIONAL A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR NEUTRALITY OR OPPOSITION. FOR WAS DOING EVERYBODY IN ONE BIG GROUP IT'LL BE FUN. SHARE BERMAN MEMBERS NICKEL SITE ON WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE FIRST TO ONE OF THINK THE AUTHORS WILL SEE CO WE CAN WORK FOR SEVERAL MONTHS ON THIS. PRODUCT COMMON CAUSES STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF OUR ELAINE CONCEPT WE THINK THIS IS WHERE THE STATE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO GO. WE DON'T THINK WE'RE QUITE THERE YET WITH THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT. I'D SAY TO THE THINGS GOING FORWARD THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON AND HOPE WE CAN READ RESOLUTION FRAWLEY WILL BE MORE CLARITY ON. THE USAGE OF BALLOT IMAGES AS WELL AS THE TIMING ISSUE THOSE HARD TO ME TO THE TWO LARGER LOOMING ISSUE. SO DO YOU THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK AND LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE THANK YOU. RICHARD TAM OF THE VOTING RIGHTS TASK FORCE A AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK FOR WORKING WITH US SO. SO WELL ON THIS BILL AND. I CONSIDER THIS BILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE VERY MUCH ARTS OF. IN SUPPORT OF A RISK LIMITING AUDIT OF ELECTIONS WE THINK IT'S VERY. VERY MUCH NEEDED. BUT THIS BILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK YET A I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE TOTALS THAT ARE USED TO AND THE TIMING OF WHEN A RISK LIMITING ORDER ORDER CAN START BECAUSE. A ACCORDING TO TALK TO PHILIP STARK. ALL THE BALLOTS NEED TO BE COUNTED. BUT IN THE REAL WORLD OF THE VERY LARGE COUNTIES THEY ARE COUNTING TO THE VERY LAST DAY OF THE CAMPUS PERIOD. SO I THINK WE NEED TO COMPROMISE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN WHERE PRACTICALLY ALL THE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED. AND THE ONES THAT ARE NOT YET RESOLVED AND COUNTED. YEAH I CAN BE COUNTED. FOR THE LOSER COUNTED MOST CONSERVATIVELY TO NARROW THE MARGIN. SO THAT. OF BUTTON BUT WE CAN'T. SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA USE THE TOTALS ON ELECTION NIGHT BECAUSE THAT. EXCLUDES A THIRD OF ALL THE BALLOTS THAT. YOU KNOW AND SERVE THAT WON'T TO SO WE ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF RISK LIMITING AUDITS. THIS BILL WE CONSIDER A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE'RE NOT SURE WE CAN SUPPORT IT THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW WE WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE TO. SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S MUCH TOO WEAK TO WAITERS THERE IN NEEDS. A LOT OF CHANGES YET THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ELECTRIFYING A CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN. WE'VE NOT YET TAKEN A POSITION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ON THIS BILL BUT WE LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK IN THE SPONSOR. AS WELL THIS IS WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT I THINK I I WOULD. CURRENTLY ECHO SOME OF THE CURRENTS THAT CONCERNS BY COMMON CAUSE IN THE VOTING RIGHTS TASK FORCE IN REGARDS TO TIMING IN THE CLARITY OF. A BALLOT IMAGES AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER ASPECTS SO I WILL BE WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY AND AND HOPE WE CAN. HELP WELL. WHERE POSSIBLE TO KEEP THIS MOVING FORWARD AND PROVE IT TO WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE THANK YOU THANK YOU? TIFFANY MOCKINGLY HALF OF THE SECRETARY STATE IN SUPPORT AND WE LOOK FORWARD THE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRING HIM BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ON THE FLOOR. SEEING NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER CORBETT YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH SO AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING I VERY MUCH EMBRACE. THEM SOME GOOD SUGGESTIONS HERE ARE ONE OF THE POINTS THE RISK WOULD MEAN AUDIT IS TO GO BEYOND WHAT COMES IN ON THAT FIRST NIGHT. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE CONVERSATION. ARM THEN IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING SOMETHING WHICH IS BOTH PRACTICAL AND. AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT WE FINISHED IT'LL BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE. AND WE'LL JUST SEE HOW CLOSE WE CAN GET TO THE VERY BEST THING THAT EVERYBODY CAN SUPPORT FROM. THE MOMENT I JUST PROMISED WORK VERY HARD WITH FED CHAIRMAN OTHERS AND. COMMON CAUSE AND. AT CETERA SO WE WILL WORK VERY HARD AND ALL BILLS YOUR WORK IN PROGRESS UNTIL THE COVENANT SHOT AND SEE IF IF IF. SO AND THAT THE TRUTH YEAH. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TARA MISTER QUIRK I ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING RISK LIMITING AUDITS HAVING THE ABILITY TO ON ELECTION RESULTS IS PARAMOUNT INSTILLING CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS. I A FULLY UNDERSTAND AS WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY FOLKS TODAY THAT OTHER STILL SOME ISSUES THAT ARE BEING WORKED ON THE ME TO SAY. THAT THIS IS A REMARKABLY. IT KINDA TECHNICAL ISSUE AND I THINK THERE'S NO BETTER AUTHOR FOR THEN. MISTER QUIRK. SO I THINK IF YOU WERE IN GOOD HANDS IN TERMS OF. GETTING TO THE RIGHT. SOLUTION AS WE WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE STICKIER. ISSUES THAT ARE STILL OUTSTANDING. AND I KNOW THAT. THE AUTHORED SPONSOR WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GOOD FAITH DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PER PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL.
