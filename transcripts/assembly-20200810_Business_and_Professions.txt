THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM OPERATOR NUMBER IN THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO SPEAK TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE ITEM BEFORE US BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION I JUST WANTED TO ASK- ESPECIALLY. I THINK DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD BE IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE. TO BE ABLE TO ASK A QUESTION AND THAT IS- I DID READ THE MATERIAL BUT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THE ACTUAL NEED. TO INCREASE THE FEE AND I BELIEVE. THERE THE EXISTING VIA SIX DOLLARS. THE INITIAL ASK WAS TO INCREASE IT TO FOURTEEN IT'S NOW BEEN BACK DOWN TO TWELVE. SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL NEED TO INCREASE THE FREE AND- IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS IT'S A REASONABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING AND MAINTAINING. CURES SO IS IT BECAUSE SIX DOLLARS WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH. OR IS IT BECAUSE THERE ARE LESS LICENSEES PAYING THE FEE. GREAT I ALSO- BEFORE WE GET TO THAT QUESTION ANSWERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ALSO WANT TO. MAKE IT A TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE BOARD REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE BORDER- THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD. OF PODIATRY IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES ARE ALSO ON THE LINE AS WELL TOO SO AGAIN IF WE COULD GET CLARIFICATION FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY TRAVIS AGAIN AND YET OF A FIXED DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE IS AFFECT THE LICENSEES AUTHORIZED TO PRESCRIBE ORDER ADMINISTER FURNISHED OR DEFENSE SCHEDULED TO THREE OR FOUR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THE NUMBER LICENSEES HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT I'M AWARE OF BUT I WILL AND ELECT HIM CHRIS MEYER AND LET US KNOW IF THAT IS NOT ACCURATE. AND WHAT HAS CHANGED THOUGH AND WHY WE BONTA THE TWELVE DOLLARS IS WHEN WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IT AT FOURTEEN AND- THAT THE STATE HAD NOT CLOSED THERE ARE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR AND FISCAL PROCESS. AND SO THERE WERE SOME SAVINGS REALIZED THERE AND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO RE EVALUATE THE FEE AMOUNT AND UPDATED A PHONE THAT NEW INFORMATION. I KEEP A CLEAN WHEN A SOME OF THE COSTS DRIVERS ARE. BILLS AND OF LEGISLATION THAT THEN REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION BY DOJ AND WHILE THE BILLS THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATION WE DO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS EVERY YEAR. AND IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THOSE BELLS. AND SO. IN THAT PROCESS AND IT HI YOU MAY RECALL WHEN WE WERE NEGOTIATING THE FINAL BUDGET ONE OF THE BILL THAT WAS INCLUDED WHEN EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE F. AND THAT WE ALSO KNEW WOULD REQUIRE. CONTRIBUTED NEED FOR A FEE INCREASE THAT WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY MOVED FROM THE BUDGET WHILE WE WORK ON THE ISSUE AND IT IS NOW BACK IN. THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL JUNIOR OR CONSIDERATION AND APPROVAL. AND HE OKAY WOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE STICK WITH THAT TO THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH ANY ADULTS HAVE RECENTLY. IF YOU WANT GO BACK TO WHATEVER BILL AND I GIVE THE TO EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL. BUILT ON THE BUT THEY WERE FOR BILLS THAT WERE CAP. AND RESULTED IN BY OF HER. FOR THE NINETY TWENTY ACROSS. AND AT THE TIME OF THE APPROVAL OF THE LARGEST. AND THE ADMIN. WHERE WHERE WOULD. CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOR THE INCREASE. AND AS I AND A- IT AND DEFEAT. IT WILL BE IN EFFECT OUR- APRIL FIRST TWENTY ONE CURRENT IS SIX DOLLARS. IT WILL BE AND TWELVE DOLLARS EFFECTIVE APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT'LL BE SETBACK RATE UNTIL MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT WHICH TIME IT WILL BE REDUCED DOWN TO NINE DOLLARS. AND BEGINNING AT JULY FIRST TWENTY THREE TWO FOUR EIGHT FOUR APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AS WE THINK THAT IS WHAT IS NECESSARY BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE COST. BEING INCURRED AND BY BOTH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND DCS. AND WITH THAT A. AS- HOPE THAT THE DAY OR DCA. CAN AT ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WITH ANY OTHER MEMBER OF WOULD WISH TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION AT THIS TIME- FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE BOARDS OR DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. OKAY HEARING NONE- MEMBERS- FOR GIVE ME A LOT WAS TO CHECK THE REMOTE VIEWING ROOM I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS ONE INDIVIDUALS IN THE REMOTE VIEWING ROOM. A WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SO IF THE START OF A KILEY ALLOW THE- INDIVIDUAL TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION IN THE REMOTE VIEWING ROOM. I THINK YOU GUYS ALL SEE AND HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU KELLY BEAM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. PROVIDERS ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE CURES DATABASE RECOGNIZING ITS POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE VALUABLE CLINICAL INFORMATION THAT SUPPORTS APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WELL THERE MIGHT BE A COST TO MAKE NECESSARY TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE DATABASE THE PROPOSED INCREASE REQUESTED SEEMS EXCESSIVE SENTIMENTALITY OJ PROJECTS THE TECHNICAL CHANGES TO COST MORE THAN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OVERALL THAT WAS COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AN AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS COMPONENTOF THE BILL IT WAS A QUICK TURNAROUND. THE DUE DILIGENCE OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE HELP TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THE FUND. HOW MUCH OF THE CURRENT FEET AT COULD COVER THE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. AND JUST HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE IS JUSTIFIED ACROSS ALL THE HEALTHCARE LICENSEES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURES DATABASE. I WILL TAKE THESE MOMENTS BACK TO OUR MEMBERS FOR AN UPDATED POSITION BUT WE THINK YOU. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL POLICY CONSIDERATIONS ARE MEMBERS REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK INTO REGARDING THE CURES DATABASE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE COLLABORATION WITH YOU ALL TO STRENGTHEN THE DATABASE NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE SOME MORE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND INTENTIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK. INTO THE REMOTE VIEWING ROOM. FIFTY NINE WILL TAKE THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN THEN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOLLOWED BY SEVEN NUMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION- I HAVE TO ADMIT LIKE I THINK MANY OF OR COLLEAGUES WE- WERE ALL PRETTY SURPRISED IN THE LAST- YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW DAYS IS WERE REVIEWING THIS THAT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING AT THIS POINT AS OPPOSED TO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND- AS A- SON AND A BROTHER OF AN ACUPUNCTURIST WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING AT THIS TIME. IT TO. IT'S CHALLENGING- SO HAVE A QUESTION TO THE DCA DIRECTOR IF- IF- DIRECTOR STILL AVAILABLE. AND I SERVE ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES DC AND WE HAVE HAD. OUR CONVERSATION FOR MANY YEARS ABOUT. THE INCREDIBLE FIASCO THAT HAS BEEN THE BREEZE SYSTEM- DCH LICENSING SYSTEM. OUR SYSTEM THAT. WAS INITIALLY BUDGETED AT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR ITS RECALL. THAT LIKE TO MANY. LARGE IT PROJECTS IN THE STATE BALLOON TO A NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT- LITERALLY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEHIND. MANY YEARS DELAYED THERE WAS REFERENCE MADE IN THE OPENING COMMENTS AROUND I. T. AND MY QUESTIONS ARE REALLY. HOW MUCH. HAS THE CHALLENGES OF THAT PROGRAM. REQUIRED THE FEE INCREASES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY- BECAUSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT. CONTINUE AS CONTINUE TO REMAIN- TO BE. RELEASED ON JAN. AND YEAH THAT. SADDLE UP OUR- ALL OUR OUR YOU KNOW MANY TIMES MORE BUSINESS CAN WERE THIS IS JOHN. AND WHY ARE WE DISCUSSING THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS COMMITTEE AS OPPOSED TO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. WHERE WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH ALL THESE ISSUES TOGETHER. THANK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER TO. KIMBERLY CLARK FIRE WITH THE CA- JUST AT. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM AND WHETHER THESE THREE ENTITIES ARE RELATED TO THAT. SO OBVIOUSLY IT'S A CONGLOMERATION OF ISSUES THAT HAVE CAUSED THE- FEE INCREASES FOR THESE BOARDS. THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD IN PARTICULAR YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THEM THEY ACTUALLY ARE NOT PART OF THE PRE SET THEM- THERE YOU ARE GOING THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED A WHOLE PART ONE TO OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN WHICH I BELIEVE YOU'RE AWARE OF. AND SO THEY WILL HAVE SOME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TO CHANGE UP THEIR OLD SYSTEM INTO THE NEW SYSTEM SO THEY THAT PIECE OF IT. THE OTHER TO BOARD THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AND- DEPORTEE AFTER MEDICAL FOR BOTH OF THEM ARE PART OF THE GREEK SYSTEM. BUT REALLY TO A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT COST INCREASES- ON CALPERS RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ALSO WE HAVE- ATTORNEY GENERAL CLASS BE INCREASES AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE. HEARINGS INCREASES UNTIL IT'S ALL BEEN ALL OF THESE THINGS ALTOGETHER THAT HAS- AS- IMPACTED THAT AND THEN I GET A WOULD ALSO LIKE IF MISTER PODIA IS STILL ON THE LINE AS WELL. BECAUSE BECAUSE PERFECT AND HOW BUSINESS AND THEY WORK FOR HIM. AND REALLY- WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE SENATE. APPROVED THROUGH THE HONORED THE PROCESS AND THEY WERE BE ROLLING OUT SOME OF THEIR INITIAL CHANGES I BELIEVE- AND THAT AT THE END OF THAT SUMMER I'M FOR THAT PARTICULAR SET UP- WHETHER I. BELIEVE I'M STRONG. ONLINE AND THIS WAS A ISSUE THAT WE- I'M BETTING FOR INCREASED WITH THE- ASSET. WE WOULD. WITH THE INCREASE IN IT HE HAD. AT THE GARDEN I MEAN HAPPY TO AND ADDRESS BUT I THINK- I THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS THAT. TYPICALLY THAT HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH THE FACT THAT THE HUGE FEE INCREASE THE PUBLIC ON THE BEDROCK BUDGET PROCESS AT LEAST IN RECENT REPORT HISTORY- WE GET IT OUT IN THE PARTY BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH NEED HAVE WHEN. BC INCREASE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE A NEED TO BE A PLACE. TO STAY- RETAIN STRUCTURAL BALANCE WITHIN THE FUNDS- ARE RECOGNIZING THE KOBE CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS AND A LOT OF WAYS. ADEQUATELY THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE THOUGHT IT MADE NO SENSE IT INCLUDES EVEN THE BUDGET PROFIT FIFTY NINE I THINK GOING FORWARD WILL HAVE TO HAVE CONTINUE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE- BUT REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE- AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER COLORADO. WITH A CLAIM WILLING TO AND- TAKE THIS ONE FOR US BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT THE FEE INCREASES ARE NECESSARY FOR STRUCTURAL BALANCE IN HERE. IF I COULD JUST REPLY. TO SO I'D HEAR TO ANSWER TO MIKE. ABOUT WHETHER. THE FEW OF THE BREEZES WHICH WAS AND IS BUDGET ADDED TO. MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHICH IS NOW IN NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AND GOING. WHICH STARTED I THINK IN 200-010-2000 ELEVEN AND IS STILL GOING WHETHER THOSE COST PRESSURES ARE IMPACTING WHY WE HAVE TO RAISE HE'S HE'S AT THIS POINT AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKING. IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR. FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN A SATISFACTORY ANSWER THE RELEVANCE TO THIS IS IN PART RELATED TO THE RELEVANCE OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY OF C. R. ET DE SYSTEM. WHICH HAS FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE NOT BEEN REFORMED AND WE'VE BEEN RAISING QUESTIONS FRANKLY IT'S BEEN A VERY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE TRYING TO GET TO THE ANSWERS OF ITSELF I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY STRESS TODAY ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN THESE BUT WHAT I DO READ. IN THE EMAIL SAYS IS THAT. YOU'RE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LICENSING. THOSE SAME BACKLOG AT RISK OF TO BE ADDRESS. BY EIGHTY REFORM SO. I HAVE TO ADMIT I. I HAVE TREMENDOUS HARPER AROUND THIS PARTICULAR KNOWING. THE STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESSES THAT. HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH THE FAILURES OF. THE SYSTEM HERE AND SO- ONGOING QUESTIONS- LOOK FORWARD TO MORE ANSWERS- IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND HERE BUT- JUST WANTED TO STATUS FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SIMILAR ISSUE. THIS AMERICAN GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO. P. BACK IN THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO A LESS OF A QUESTION IS MORE OF A COMMENT- AND I. ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW IT IS OFTEN NOT SEXY TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR UNWILLINGNESS TO DO THAT IS ON FULL DISPLAY WITH THE DYSFUNCTION IN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM NOW. AND SO THAT- THAT REQUIRES THIS PARTICULAR ACTION TODAY WHAT I WANT TO GET TO IS LESS ABOUT THE VENUE ISSUE WHICH WAS MENTIONED THE I. T. ISSUE WAS MENTIONED WHICH IS JUST TO GET INTO A GOOD BUDGET PRACTICES WHICH WHEN I READ THE STAFF REPORT I WAS MORTIFIED. WHEN READING THAT THERE ARE FEES HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED IN OVER TWENTY YEARS THAT IS THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MAY HAVE HAPPENED BUT TO THE QUESTION OF TIMING YOU KNOW IT SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WE'VE GOT MANY ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS WITH THIS WOULD MARKET IN A MORE. APPROPRIATE TIME THIS YEAR WE. ARE IN. FIRST TIME HAD IT. FOR YEARS AND BASS PEOPLE TO PAY MORE. NOW THAT MAYBE NOT. BUT I ASKED THE MINISTRY. I THE- WHEN WILL YOU ADOPT A FEE OF ALL PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS POSSIBLE WHAT. WE ADJUSTED AND HAVE A BIT OF COSCO DOWN MAYBE THEY CAN GO DOWN AS WELL. THAT IS PARTICULAR EFFECT IN THE MIDDLE WHICH I APPRECIATE IN IN THE AUTHOR TAKING. TO TAKE WHAT WAS GOING TO BE A- IN. FEE AND MAKE IT TWELVE IN AN- ADVENTUROUS- LESS THAN THAT. WHICH SHOWS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS IN HERE WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THESE THINGS AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR AT AT. THAT ANNUALLY IT POPPED UP. SO HI I. APOLOGIZE TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF GROUP THERAPY HERE IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY. BUT WHEN LOOKING AT THIS ITEM WHICH IS PROBABLY NECESSARY GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE INFORMATION WOULD BE PROVIDED IN TERMS OF. THE DIRE STRAITS OF SOMEBODY'S FUNDS. I SIMPLY ASK THE QUESTION WHY IS IT TAKING TWENTY YEARS FOR ONE IN PARTICULAR WILL HAVE TO TAKE IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE CENTS ANOTHER ONE. AND HOW MANY MORE OUT THERE THAT WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING AND WE MAY BE ASKED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO WHEN WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO STRUGGLING. WITH AT MY COLLEAGUES AND SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONS PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY CAPABLE THAN EVER. IN THE SPAC OF- IT'S NOT JUST A COUPLE OF BUCKS WHEN YOU LOOK INTO IT ALL TOLD THESE ARE. HUNDREDS IF NOT MORE THAN A COUPLE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WE SHOULD TAKE LIGHTLY AND THERE ARE BETTER APPROACHES TO DOING THIS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO PAY THIS FEE SO I WOULD OFFER SOME STRUCTURAL FOR TO. QUESTION GOING FORWARD. I DO BUT I. THE NATURE WHERE THE COMING. OBVIOUSLY THE- AND THAT IN. INFRASTRUCTURE. MORE BORN IN A- TO MAKE SURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HEARD A NUMBER OF COMMENTS THAT I WOULD ASSUME. THE MYSTERY WOULD LIKE TO ALL RISK TO AT AND CLOSE BUT WILL THEN MOVE ON TO A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BEGIN WITH A SECOND WOMAN EGGMAN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I ALSO DON'T. HAVE A REAL QUESTION I JUST THINK WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL GRAPPLING WITH THIS THIS VERY ISSUE- COVERT IS CERTAINLY I THINK PULL BACK ON THE COVERS ON A LOT OF THE DYSFUNCTION THAT EXISTS THAT THE STATE FOR A WHILE- AND IT'S AND WE AND WE- DIVE INTO IT I. I JUST WROTE A LETTER ASKING IF WE COULD LOOK AT THE FEES JUST BECAUSE ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. OKAY A VERIFY BUT HE SAID HIS HE'S A LOCKSMITH AND HIS LOCKSMITH BE ONE UP FROM FIFTY DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YEAH TO BE TO A PAIN PLAN THEY SAID THEY WOULD STOP LOSS CAMPUS DO THAT SO IT IS TO ME AS WE AS EVERYONE IS STRUGGLING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH THINGS BACK DOWN ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES BBS BUT IF IT WERE WRITTEN DOUBLING DOUBLING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED AND OUT NEED TO RENEW THEIR LICENSE DOUBLING THAT THAT THAT IS TO ME IT JUST SEEMS UNREASONABLE TO BE ASKING THE COMMON PERSON STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT DURING COVERT. TO PAY TO BEAR THE COST OF THE STATE ON INVESTING IN PLACE THAT WE SHOULD THE BEST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCUMENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO JOIN MARK MY COLLEAGUES IN ADDRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE VENUE. THAT IS BEING PURSUED WITH THIS BILL. THERE IS AN EXCELLENT REASON WHY- FEE INCREASES ARE GENERALLY PROCESS THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THAT IS BECAUSE- WHEN. A DEPARTMENT SAYS WE'RE NOT TAKING IN ENOUGH MONEY WE NEED TO RAISE OUR FEES. WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE TAKING IN ENOUGH MONEY WHICH IS HAT THIS BILL DOES BUT ALSO TO GO OVER IN DETAIL. HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY. MAKING SURE THAT THE EXPENDITURES ARE REASONABLE NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE. AND BALANCING THE NEED THE DEPARTMENT AGAINST THE NEEDS OF CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE TO PAY THOSE FEES. M. WORST THING THAT STEP HERE AND TAKING LEGISLATIVE ACTION. I MYSELF DO NOT SEE. WHY THIS IS SO URGENT THAT COULD NOT GO THROUGH THE NORMAL BUDGET TWENTY FOUR SQUARE ALSO. THE LAST WEEK WE ASKED TO BUDGET TRAILER BILL. WE CAN CERTAINLY PASS MORE BUDGETARY BILLS. THE TIME THAT WE HAVE WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. HAS NUMBER GEN BUT I FEAR IT WILL TRYING TO. SORT OF THE PROCESS HERE. AND I URGE POSH IN TAKING THIS ACTION. IF WE DO. WE'RE JUST. TO APPLIES TO. THE TO PROCESS THE SCRUTINY COMES WITH THE- ANTI HIS ACTION THROUGH THIS. IN THE- WHICH I DO THINK WOULD BE GOOD. FOR INSTEAD OR FOR. VERY VERY MUCH AS SOMEONE OVER TO ANY ADDITIONAL. QUITE FOR K. AT THIS TIME DOCTOR AFTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVEN'T- INITIALLY WANTED TO COMMENT ON THIS BILL BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE TALK ABOUT THE CARES. PROGRAM ITSELF WHICH I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO GROUND OURSELVES IN WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH THE FEE INCREASE. THIS PROGRAMALLOWS US TO LOOK AT A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT SUBSTANCE USE IS ON THE RISE. AND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREASED NEED FOR US TO BE MONITORING AND EFFECTIVELY ENFORCING STRATEGIES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I DO WANT TO THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL UP AND- YOU SUPPORT. HEY SO I AM WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE NEED FOR A TO HAVE THESE DISCUSS IN THE BUDGET SETTING AS IT ALLOWS US THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A NEED DURING THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. SEEING A NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PERHAPS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON IF YOU WISH TO ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS FROM ADMINISTRATION AND RESPECTIVE AGENCIES. RESPOND AS YOUR CLOTHES AS WELL TOO SHE DESIRES. IF ONE OF THEM HAS SOMETHING THEY'D LIKE TO SAY I'M MORE THAN WELCOME THEM TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SURE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY MY COLLEAGUES TO HAPPEN MINISTRATION ON THE LINE. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ALSO SEE. THAT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY ON THE QUESTIONS OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SO WITH ANY. OTHER MEMBER OF THE- RESPECTIVE AGENCIES WHICH TO RESPOND AT THIS TIME. SHOULD I NEED ARTICLE IN MOTHER CARE. GO HEADING. I'M SORRY I'M I'LL BE BRIEF I THINK HE'LL AND I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE DID INCLUDE THE FINANCIALLY AND TRAILER BILL- SO THAT THE QUESTIONS STARTED THERE I TYPICALLY THAT IS NOT COMMON FOR ATHLETES TYPICALLY THE- TYPICALLY GO THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROPERTY AGAIN AT LEAST FROM RECENT HISTORY AND MANY OF THEM ARE TIED TO THAT- SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS THROUGH THOSE THOSE FEET THAT THE AUDIT. AND THAT ARE CONDUCTED FOR MOST OF THE FOURTH IN EUROPE I'M NOT SURE I CAN THINK ALL I WOULD NEED THE STATE TO CONFIRM THAT- BUT THAT IS THE TYPICAL PROCESS AND BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED FOR AND ONE CASE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND ANOTHER ONE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS- IT IS IT DID IT THE PROCESS AND WE TRIED TO ONLY RAISE THAT ONE IN THERE WHEN THERE IS AN ABSOLUTELY. BUT THAT IS WHAT THE PUBLIC NOW AGAIN WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH THIS WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WHEN WE USE THE PROPER THE TWENTY HAVE CHANGED BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND WE DO DISCUSS WHAT OR NOT IT AN IMPACT ON THE TO BE BUT TYPICALLY DON'T I THE. L. I WANTED TO OFFER THAT AND THEN MY CHRIS RYAN FROM THE OKAY WITH LIKE TALK ABOUT THE TERRIBLE ABOUT. THANK AMY THANK YOU CHAIR PRESCRIBE FROM THE OF THE JUST JUST WANT TO ADD A FEW MORE TO COME WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. THE FINANCE WE AGREE WITH COMMENT I COULD. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS SOME OF THE ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE INCREASE AT THE RED LIGHT THE I. P. AND THOSE ID CARDS I THINK SOME OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT. THE CARD LICENSE HAS NOT BEEN A JOY FOR SOME. SO THERE ARE THE VERY STRIVE RELATED TO. YOU KNOW SALARIES AND BENEFITS AND THE COST OF MY I. T. OVER THE LAST DECADE INCREASING- HAVE GONE UP AND SO- IT MAKES FOR. A LARGER GAP AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THE OTHER ITEM I'D JUST LIKE TO CONTACT BRIEFLY ON. THERE WAS A QUESTION RELATED TO OTHER IT PROJECTS. AND I THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL OR THE I. DID FROM THE UNITED. THAT IS UP AND RUNNING BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE PASSED TO BE A LEGISLATION.

THANK YOU. PRESS ONE NOW MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN. BY SENATOR DOT. SENATE ARE WELCOME PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN SEEKS TO INCREASE THE ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILDBIRTH BY ALLOWING CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF A PHYSICIAN. SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN PROVIDES A WELL DELINEATED SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR ALL NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY NO MATTER THE CARE SETTING. SB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR EXIST FOR PHYSICIAN NURSE MIDWIVES COLLABORATION ON MODERATE IN THE HIGHER RISK PATIENTS THEIR MOOD MUTUALLY AGREED UPON POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS. THESE PROTOCOLS SPELL OUT HOW INTERWETTEN DITION MIDWIVES WILL WORK WITH PHYSICIAN PARTNERS IN AN INTEGRATED TEAM BASED MODE WHEN THE TRANSFER CARE. UTILIZING THE SIDE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS IS A NATIONAL NURSE MIDWIFERY STANDARD SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NURSE MIDWIVES IN IS NOT SUPERVISION LET ME REPEAT THAT UTILIZING THE SIDE POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS IS A NATIONAL NURSE MIDWIFERY STATE SET FORTH. BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NURSE MIDWIVES AND IS NOT SUPERVISION. SUPERVISION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE IT'S NOT DEFINING THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE IS DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE POSITION TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT. EXAMINE THE PATIENT SIDE A REVIEW IN THE CHARTS. OR OVERSEE PATIENT CARE IN ANY WAY. SUPERVISION ALSO FORCES NURSE MIDWIVES TO CONCENTRATE IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE THE POSITIONS PHYSICALLY PRACTICE. THIS REDUCES ACCESS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COUNTIES IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ASTONISHINGLY THERE ARE NINE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THEY DO NOT HAVE. A SINLE PRACTICING OBGYN. THERE IS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RACE ACCESS IN MATERNITY OUTCOME. ACCORDING TO THE MARCH OF DIMES IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION IMPROVING ACCESS TO NURSE MIDWIFERY MIDWIFERY CARE. IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES IN ADDRESSING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN THE DELIVERY OF A SEXUAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ALSO I WISH TO POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF FOUR STATES IN THE NATION THAT STILL REQUIRES PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION IN ORDER FOR NURSE MIDWIVES TO PRACTICE. RECENT AMENDMENTS CLARIFY TRANSFER PROTOCOLS CODIFY THE ROLE IN MAKE UP WITH THE NURSE MIDWIFERY ESOS- INVITED THREE COMMITTEE IN ADVERTORIAL THE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE WILL HELP DRIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERNITY CARE. ALTOGETHER THESE AMENDMENTS SATISFIED REMAINING CONCERNS RAISED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN A COD. GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF LICENSE BID WIVES WHO WERE NOT IMPACTED IN THIS BILL AGAIN NURSE MIDWIVES ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THIS BILL IN THE WAKE WHICH TODAY REFLECTS AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SAFETY. AND ECONOMY. IN RESPONSE TO THEIR CONCERNS THIS BILL FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER INCLUDES PATIENT ECONOMY LANGUAGE THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN ANY OTHER MIDWIFERY STATUTE. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHILE SEARCHES HAVE BEEN MADE AT THIS BILL NEWLY EXPANSIVE PORTIONS BY MIDWIVES. IT DOES NOT. NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES ANYTHING IN THAT AREA AT ALL. STORY. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS HOLLY SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES ASSOCIATION M.

AT THE ONE TWO THREE SEVEN INNOVATIVELY CARTS OUT INDEPENDENT SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR THERE'S BEEN WIDESPREAD REMOVES RESTRICTIVE BARRIERS SUCH AS SUPER BIT. AND COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENTS THE OPENING UP ACCESS WHERE THE NEED IS GREATEST. THE BILL ALSO INJURED THE TEAM BASED APPROACH TO CARE FOR WOMEN AND WORKING PEOPLE WHO NEED MEDICAL CARE.

BY SENATOR GALGIANI WELCOME CENTER GOTCHA THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THE MONEY. THIS BILL IS TO THINK OF SHELTER STAFF A SURROGATE PET OWNERS FOR RESCUE ANIMALS UNDER THEIR CARE. TELL THEM ALL CAN BE SAFE RETURNED TO HONOR ADOPTED TO A GOOD HOME. THE CURRENT. EXAMS THE OF THE PAT FROM THE PATH OF. MEDICINE AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT. ACCORDING TO MY RECENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WARNING NUYS. HUNDRED THOUSAND CATS AND- STATE Y. SINGLE YEAR. THIS BILL WILL. IT OWNERS CAN GIVE THEIR ANIMALS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS BUT STATE LAW CURRENTLY PROHIBITS NON VETERINARY MEDICAL STAFF. FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THE SAME. THIS MEANS THAT IF AN ANIMAL COMES INTO THE SHELTER WITH FLEAS NONFAT STAFF ARE LEGALLY EMPOWERED TO EUTHANIZE BUT NOT TO GIVE THE MALL A FLEA PILL. THIS BILL WILL EQUALIZE THE ABILITY FOR ANIMAL SHELTER CARETAKERS TO PROVIDE FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AN ANIMAL IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU AND I ARE ALLOWED TO DO SO. FOR OUR OWN PET. THIS BILL SIX. PROPER TRAINED OFFICERS EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS OF ANIMALS. B. AND B. AT THE KEY TO A MESS ADMINISTERED OVER THE COUNTER OR NON FICTION. THE NATION'S. A SAME WAY THAT ON DO. IN THE LAST RECESSION PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES WERE BAD. WE'LL BE REPEATING ITSELF. THE S. OF FLOYD CAL. AND SHE- BUDGETS DO TO THE COVERED NINETY PAN. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE SHELTERS WITH SOME REGULATORY RELIEF TO HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF EUTHANIZED ANIMALS AND TO SUPPORT GOVERNOR AVENUES SAYA MAKE CALIFORNIA A NO KILL STATE. OUT THIS BILL EUTHANASIA WILL BE THE ONLY MEANS TO CONTROL A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE WITHIN SOME SHELTERS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DURING THE RECENT DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WE SAW COUNTLESS IMAGES OF VICTIMSWITH THEIR PETS STRUGGLING TO EVACUATE TO SAFETY. ACCORDING TO A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE FOLLOWING THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN STORMS OF EL NINO IT WAS ON THAT 80% OF PEOPLE WHO RE ENTERED THE IN. ACTUATED AREA IS RESCUE THERE PAT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS LONG RECOGNIZED PRINCE OF THE- TO ABANDON. PLACE THE DESIGN VASE. THE AS SUCH AND THOUSAND SIX LEGISLATURE PASS A BEFORE FIFTY WHICH REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO ADOPT A CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WAS EMERGENCY SYSTEM PROGRAM AND INCORPORATE PET EVACUATION AND RELOCATION PROCEDURES AND TO THE STANDARD EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THIS FURTHER INTENT BY SHELTERS WILL BE BUILT TO PROVIDE BASIC FIRST AID AND WE CARE. CHANGING BACK THIS OR DRESSING WITHOUT LIMITING THEIR CARE. TO DISASTERS. WE HAVE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS AS REQUIRED BY CONSTABULARY STAFF IN JULY PAGE TWO AND THREE OF THE TEXT SECTION FORTY EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN PART EIGHT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS TO COMMIT TENUATE. LET'S SEE. OVER THE REGISTER ENGLISH THROUGH THE NEXT SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD.

HE IS PROVIDING ANIMAL CAN'T CARE AND CONTROL MANDATE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CONCEPT OF MANDATORY VAT REGISTRATION BE DISCUSSED. IN A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND THE REGIONAL COUNCIL OF RURAL COUNTIES. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT EVEN WITH THIS BILL. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SHELTERS WILL STILL HAVE TO. BE SUBJECT TO STATE REQUIREMENTS THEY ARE STILL REGULATED BY THE STATE CDFA STATURE REQUIRES TRACKING OF ALL MEDICATION CDPH REQUIRES RABIES REPORTING AND FINALLY A SHELTER WHO DOES NOT SEEK VETERINARY CARE WHEN IT'S NEEDED IS IN VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE FIVE NINE SEVEN POINT ONE.

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BNP VETERINARIANS WHICH HAVE INCLUDED LICENSING EXAMS LICENSING FEES GOING TO SCHOOL SIMILARLY THE BORDER OF. THE TWENTY BOARD OF VETERINARY BOARD HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REVOKE A LICENSE AND OR REPRIMAND INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT HARM. SO THE BILL PROCESS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE MECHANISM FOR THE STATE AND THE BOARD AS ARTICULATED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE BASIC PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF. PASSIONS THAT REGULATORY. AND SO TO HAVE VOLUNTEERS WHO DON'T HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF TRAINING PROVIDE FIRST AID AND VACCINATIONS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE BUT WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT INTENT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO WHICH WHY WE DID NOT SUGGEST IN THE AMENDMENTS TO RECALL ARMORING THAT IS WHY. WITHOUT OF THAT. SIR FOR K. YEAH HOUSE RECORD YOU READ. TO ALLOW FOR THE FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT THE OVERSIGHT PROTECTIONS IN PLACE SO THAT SHOULD THERE BE SIGNIFICANT HARM THAT THE STATE HAS FRATERNITY TO SUPPORT THOSE CONSUMERS SIMILARLY MEMBERS ALONG THE REALM OF BUSINESSES PASSIONS WE DO A NUMBER LICENSE CATEGORIES WHAT I. WHETHER IT'S IN THE I THINK GOING THERE IS ARM WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE BASIC. IN PLACE. IF THERE'S COMPLAIN. THE BILL PRESENTED THERE IS THERE ARE NONE IN THIS FOR THE SAFEGUARDS THE FOR OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. AND AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW WE TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A BALANCE IN ACCESS BUT SIMPLY WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE. THOSE THAT ARE NOT LIFE PROVIDE VACCINATIONS. ON COVERT OR OTHER. RELATED ITEMS SO AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THE REGISTRATION TO HELP SUPPORT AND COMPROMISED IS THAT OF A REGISTRATION. NOT CERTIFICATION NOT. A CENSURE BUT REGISTRATION AND THE REGISTRATION AGAIN PROVIDES THAT FROM OR TO ALLOW FOR WHAT WE THINK WE COLLECTIVELY WANT TO SEE WHICH INCREASED TAX. AND THAT'S WHAT. THE REGISTRATION. TO STILL RESERVE THAT PROTECTION AND UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT THE PROTECTIONS WE HAVE HEARD SPECIFICALLY FROM THE VETERINARIAN BORE. THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT. THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL INTENT. OR PERHAPS. DRUG OFFENSES THAT MIGHT BE. SUBJECTED TO IT WITHIN THE SHELTERS GET SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO LOOK AT. AS WELL. FOR THE SENATE AND THAT'S WHY. WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL AGAIN WE COULD'VE GONE STRONGER ON STRICT LICENSURE OR EVEN ON CERTIFICATION BOETTCHER SAID SIMPLY REGISTRATION. SO AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE ARE SO SUGGESTING THAT THE AUTHOR EXCEPT THE AMEND SIZES BUT WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. THE AND I WAS MAKING A SECOND WITH. AN IMPRINT THIS IS. THANKS I NEED QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CAN MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. I SEE NINE HUNDRED JANET DO WISH TO CLOSE. I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION.

THE TICKET EXPERTISE. IN THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS AREA AND WE WANT TO SEE THIS BE SUCCESSFUL BUT WE HONOR ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE.
