ROLL CALL [inaudible] I HAVE [inaudible] MR [inaudible] GLAZIER. SURE GLAZER SP TWELVE THIRTY FIVE ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I AM MOTION BY MISS RATES IN A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO -- THIS LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MANY THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAT OUR COUNTRY'S TRUTH IN LENDING LAWS HAVE GIVEN CONSUMERS MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY. I'VE REQUIRE LENDERS AND OTHER FINANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT DISCLOSURES TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN THEY OFFER THEM FINANCING. AND WHEN THEY CLOSE THE IDEAL. I KNOW THAT THERE REMAINS DESPITE THAT GREAT AMOUNT OF WORK THIS YEAR SOME OPPOSITION REMAINING. AND DEPENDING ON THAT COMMENTS THEY MIGHT MAKE I CAN GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL. BUT I THINK YOU SEE FROM THE ANALYSIS IT JUST REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF SIX BASIC ELEMENTS. REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE COST OF MONEY -- AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS A I DISCLOSURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO COMPARISON SHOP AS A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON FROM. ONE LENDER TO ANOTHER -- AT THIS SMALL. LENDING OUT MARKET IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE INTO BUSINESSES I DON'T WANNA AFFECT THAT IT HURT IT. I'M BUT I THINK WE FOUND THE RIGHT CHORD. AND AS I IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE YOU THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE. AND TOO MANY THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE WORK THEY'VE DONE TO HELP US MOLD THIS BILL TO WHERE IT IS TODAY HAVE. TWO EYEWITNESSES THAT TO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF SUPPORTERS AT CAROL LENA MARTINEZ THE CEO OF CALIFORNIA SUSHI XIN OF MICROENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY. AND LOUISE AT QUE DIETZ PACK OF THE LENDING CLUB THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION HOW OUR MIND FOLKS THIS IS A DO PASS HAS A MOTION A SECOND AND IT'S LATE -- AND SO IF WE CAN JUST MAKE SURE WE SPEAK ONLY TO THE FISCAL. QUESTION OF THE BILL MAY PROCEED. WELL THANK YEAR TREK GONZALEZ FLETCHER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND COUNTY MARTINEZ AND THE CEO OF THE TIME YOU KNOW AND IT'S VOICE FOR MICRO BUSINESS SAYS IN CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS AGENCIES THE SMALL BUSINESS TRAINING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA SERVING FIFTY THOUSAND BUSINESS. OWNERS -- I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY S. B. TO AUTHORED FIGHTS I'M POOR AND THIS SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND BUSINESS I STILL STRUGGLE TO GET THE LUNGS FROM TRADITIONAL LENDERS -- NEW TYPES OF PHONE LINES CALLING FINANCING ARE COMMON FOR OPTIONS CAN BE A GOOD THING BUT MANY OF THESE OPTIONS ARE NOT TRANSPARENT ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY POTS -- OUR MEMBERS WORK EVERYDAY WITH A SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE IN TROUBLE THE BUSINESS HONOR TO GOD FINANCING WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST. WHY BECAUSE THEY ONLY LENDER IT NEVER TOLD THEM? WITHOUT S. B. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE LENDERS DON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE PRICES TRANSPARENTLY AND SOME DO NOT. RESEARCH BY CAMEO OPPORTUNITY FUND -- FOUND SOME CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE PAYING ONLINE VENDORS RATES OF 94% ON AVERAGE WITHOUT DISCLOSING THEM TO BORROWER. WE'VE PAYMENTS ABOUT DOUBLE WHAT THE BUSINESS COULD AFFORD. SOMETIMES OUR MEMBERS CAN HELP THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER BUT SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T. THEY CLOSE THEY LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES SO. FOR THE COMMON SENSE IS CLOSER DISCLOSURES OF SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE ARE NEEDED TO EMPOWER SMALL BUSINESSES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. CALCULATING RATES IT'S NOT DIFFICULT OUR MEMBERS MAKE THESE CALCULATIONS WHEN THEY HELP WITH SMALL BUSINESSES UNDERSTAND THE FINANCING THEY HAVE TAKEN. THE BILL IS THE RIGHT AGENCY TO FINALIZE THE DETAILS AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE BEALES RURAL MACON. I HAVE TO GET PORN SECONDS YEAH I'M I ASKED YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE TODAY IT'S SMALL BUSINESSES ARE HURTING AND THEY NEED YOUR SUPPORT. THANK THANK YOU I MARRY MY PEOPLE I'M ONLY SAY IF FISCAL ELSEWHERE WHERE ONLY SPEAKING TO THE FISCAL ANALYSIS OF THE BILL TODAY AND NO MORE THAN -- TWO TWO PEOPLE IN SUPPORTER OPPOSITION NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK CHAIRMAN JAMES LEWIS GET PACKED AND THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR LENDING CLUB BUT IN CLUBS A LOT THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MARKETPLACE LENDING COMPANY AND I'M ALSO SUPPORTING THE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ON THE COALITION. ON TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO YOUR QUESTION BY THE FISCAL IMPACT -- I'LL I'LL SHARE WHAT WE THINK THAT THE FISCAL IMPACT IS IN FACT MINIMAL ON THE STANDARDS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE BILL ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD VERY CALM AND OF THE KINDS OF OF CALCULATIONS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THEM ARE SIMPLE UP MY COMPANY DOES HE'S EVERY DAY INCLUDING FOR VARIABLE. RATE PRODUCTS AS DO OTHER COMPANIES WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE EXCEPTIONAL DIFFICULT FOR DPO TO FINALIZE DETAILS OF THIS REGULATION. AND WE THINK THE DB ó IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT ORGANIZATION AND THE ONLY AGENCY AVAILABLE TO DO IT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WE URGE STRONG SUPPORT CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD ON THIS ISSUE AND SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE DEPENDING ON IT THANK YOU THANK YOU PERFECT IN SUPPORT DENNIS LOW PER WITH THE AUTOMATIC FINANCE CORPORATION. A IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR LAURIE CAMERA SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA AND OPPORTUNITY FUNDED STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX ONLY TO REPRESENT A SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE ASSOCIATION WE THINK THE IMPACT -- EXACTLY SIGNIFICANT. DEPARTMENT IS THE OVERSIGHT DOES HAS NO EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA THEY DO A GREAT JOB PERSPECTIVE LICENSING. AND REGULATING IN THEIR HOME THOSE UNDER THEIR LICENSE HOWEVER. OF SMALL BUSINESS LENDING IS REALLY NOT IN THE ROOM WILL HOUSE THE THEY WOULD HAVE TO HIRE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS EXPERTS IN THIS AREA WHICH ARE NOT -- INEXPENSIVE ACTION VERY EXPENSIVE -- THE BILL ALSO THE ALTHOUGH IT DOES LAY OUT FIVE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT THAT THE BILL NEEDS TO CONSIDER. IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THOSE FIVE FACTORS SO IT COULD BE FIFTY DIFFERENT FACTORS DE REALIZING QUITE DECIDED WHETHER. WHICH FACTORS ARE GOING TO USE IN ORDER TO CREATE IN THE MATRIX SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THE NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT -- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THAT AREA WE THINK THE COSTS ARE ACTUALLY PROBABLY CLOSE TO MILLION DOLLARS JUST THAT HIRING CONSULTANTS. AND ALSO REGULATORY WORK THAT'S NEEDED SO WE BILL FORTS. GOOD EVENING AT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS PAUL BAUER ON BEHALF OF THE COMMERCIAL FINANCE COALITION WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL SPEND COMPLETELY RE WRITTEN SINCE BANKING OUT WE DON'T BELIEVE TURNING OVER DPO MAKE SENSE WE THINK IT IS EXPENSIVE FOR THE STATE TO DO THAT -- AND WE DON'T THINK AN ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE RATE WORKS FOR VARIABLE PRODUCTS IN THE WAY THAT THE CENTER HAS DESCRIBED WE BELIEVE IN DISCLOSURE WE JUST THINK THE ANNUALIZED METRIC IT'S THE WRONG WAY TO GO.
