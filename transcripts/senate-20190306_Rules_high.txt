THE DEPTH OF THE ANSWERS THAT SHE WAS LOOKING OUT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME THROUGH THAT ON IT I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION I DIDN'T ANSWER AND I THINK YOU MIGHT MAY HAVE ANSWERED IT TOOK YOU LEAVE THAT. THE ME REPEATED AGAIN IT'S WHAT A PLAN YOU HAVE ON GOING FORWARD SO WE IDENTIFY MAYBE PRO ACTIVELY SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR AGENCIES AND THEIR FIVE THEIR OPERATION AND THERE FISCAL. ARE REPORTING -- I SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THE ARTISTS THAT WE GOT ACTUALLY ANTICIPATED. THE PROBLEMS AND PUT INTO THE REPORT HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS THOSE GOING FORWARD AND IT WAS CERTAINLY BY YEAR I MEAN YOU CAN'T GET IT ALL DONE. IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS SO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR. DIEM BE AND HOW WE'RE STRUCTURING OTHER REMEDIES THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND HE AND SEVERAL AREAS MOST IMPORTANTLY ARE. UNFORTUNATELY WITH GOVERNMENT WE ALWAYS HAVE THESE I. T. PROBLEMS SO JUST A QUICK CALL COMMENT ON THAT AND YOU KNOW THEN YOU ALREADY HAVE MY I BUILT ONE WEEK WHEN THEY CALL BUT I THOUGHT IT WE SHOULD HAVE THAT ON THE RECORD SO I HAVE IT. FROM MY NOTES YEAH I MEAN SUCH A GOOD CRY PRESS ON ALL OF OUR STAFF IS THAT THEY ARE OUT TALKING TO PART TO DO TO DEPARTMENTS AND IDENTIFIED ISSUES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RAISE THOSE UP AND THOSE CAN COME IN FROM ALL DIFFERENT CHANNELS THEY CAN COME IN FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT CAN COME IN FROM. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY CAN BE RAISED -- THROUGH AN AUDIT -- YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE SHOULD AND WE WE ARE LOOKING AT IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD OF PROBLEMS. I'M WE DO HAVE A RESEARCH ANALYSIS UNIT THAT DOES -- TACKLE SOME OF THESE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS AND REALLY AND DOES A MORE THOROUGH AB -- ANALYSIS OF WHAT. ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM BUT BUT WHAT ARE THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THE PROBLEM BUT THEN ALSO HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE. AND THAT'S I'M AT A PART OF MY DEPARTMENT THAT I DEFINITELY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- BECAUSE THEY DO REALLY IMPORTANT WORK ON ON THOSE -- ISSUES THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE TIME AND THE STAFF RESOURCES AT TO TAKE THE MORE IN DEPTH LOOK AT AM I ALSO AM OVERSEE AND THE AUDIT AND EVALUATION DIVISION AND THEY ALSO CAN BE A RESOURCE ON TO HELP. ADD TO ADDRESS AND GET OUT SOME OF THESE MORE I SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED SO I I PROBLEM SOLVING IT'S PART OF OUR CORE VALUES THAT FINANCE. AND IT'S ONE THAT I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE A LOT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST NECESSARILY ABOUT. ABOUT HOLDING THE LINE ON SPENDING BUT IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO ABOUT I'M REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND SOMETIMES THAT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THAT'S OKAY WHEN WE'RE SOLVING A PROBLEM FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I THE VERY GENERAL ANSWER BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING. WHEREI'M AT EACH AND EVERY DAY I HAVEN'T THE FOCUS OF OF OUR STAFF? THANK YOU FOR READING CONCERNING ZACHARY THE WHAT I EXPECTED. GOOD JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BATES MR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN. THANK YOU MS BLASTER CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS APPOINTMENT WE'VE HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING TOGETHER AND DISTINCT CAPACITIES THE THE TOUGHEST ONE I THINK WAS STARTING OUT DURING THE RECESSION IN 200-082-0009 WHEN STATE LOST ABOUT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. NEW ALWAYS MAINTAINED A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AS WE NAVIGATED THROUGH AN I GOT THAT SAME SENSITIVE. CONFIDENCE YESTERDAY WHEN WE SPOKE -- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I THINK -- WORTHWHILE FOR FOR THE COMEDIAN AND FOR THE PUBLIC -- MANY BELIEVE WE'RE HEADED TOWARDS A DAY FOR A DROP NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE QUINN. ON HOW DO YOU WANT HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT NOW -- HOW DO WE FORECAST HOW DO WE PREPARE AND? WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF CONFIDENCE ABOUT OUR ABILITY. TO WHETHER THAT DIP OR THAT DROPPED IN THE FUTURE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS I'D AT M. BEING ABLE TO RESPOND IN A BETTER WAY THAN THE LAST TIME WE WORKED ON THE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE BY BY SETTING UP A RAINY DAY FUND AND CONTINUING TO PUT MONEY. INTO THAT FIND AT THE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WAS FRONT AND CENTER WHEN WE WERE BUILDING THE BUDGET WITH THE GOVERNOR -- IS THE LACK AT THE TIME HI AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE ALMOST TEN YEARS AND TO THE CURRENT. FISCAL EXPANSION THAT'S THAT'S A RECORD ANTICIPATING THAT THERE WILL BE AT SOME POINT A SLOW DOWN AND AND AND WE FORECASTED EVEN MILD RECESSION COULD RESULTS AND A SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR DROP IN REVENUES OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD SO THAT'S A DAUNTING NUMBER. ABSOLUTELY -- BUT THAT'S ALSO WHY WE'VE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE JANUARY BUDGET IN WHAT WE CALL BUDGET RESILIENCY IN THIS IS THAT IT'S A COMBINATION. OF OF SEVERAL FACTORS ONE IS CONTINUING TO BUILD RESERVES HAVING THOSE RESERVES THAT ARE SATISFIED IN THE RAINY DAY FUND -- FOR EXACTLY AT THAT AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IT'S NOT OUR OPERATING EMERGENCY RESERVES THAT SET ASIDE FOR WHEN WE ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO NEED NEEDED. I'M AND THEN ALSO PAIN CONTINUING TO PAY DOWN DEBTS AND DEFERRALS SOME OF WHICH WERE TAKEN OUT MANY YEARS AGO. AND THAT IS ALL GOING TO HELP US I'M TO WHETHER ADD THAT THE VOLATILITY THAT DOES EXIST IN OUR REVENUE SYSTEM. I AND ALSO JUST THE CORRESPONDING -- YOU KNOW I HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE BOTH PROPOSITION -- NINETY EIGHT BUT ALSO MANY OF OUR OTHER ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT DURING ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN SOMETIMES GROW AND NOT APPROPRIATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND AND NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. I'M SO THE COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS DOES MAKE MANAGING THE STATE'S FISCAL. I'M BALANCE THE A VERY VERY -- AND IT'S AND IT'S VERY FRAGILE -- THE STATE'S BALANCE AND SO I'M I'M VERY GROUNDED AND THAT THOSE BAD YEARS THOSE RECESSION YEARS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE MAKING CHOICES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A OVER THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU -- AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK -- IN OUR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN. YOUR AGENT SEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE -- ANY EARLY WARNINGS OF CONCERN THE MORE OF US THAT CAN WITHOUT WITHOUT. CREATING UNNECESSARY PANIC JUST -- ANY TRANS -- TENDENCIES WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO KNOW THAT WELL. YES AND WE WILL BE UPDATING OUR FORECAST FOR THE MAY REVISION WHICH IS WE DO THE TWO TIMES A YEAR AND THAT'S A IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WHAT HAPPENS IN APRIL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WILL BE REALLY LOOKING AT CLEARLY -- IS ALL OF THE THE REVENUE INFORMATION COMING IN APRIL BUT ALSO THE BROADER ECONOMIC. INDICATORS IN THE ECONOMY -- ALSO WITH -- KEY AND WHERE WE ARE MONITORING THOSE ON A WEEKLY BASIS THANK YOU AND THEN MADAM CHAIR JUST MY FINALLY REALLY A COMMENT -- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY KNOW HOW MANY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS USE IT ON A NEAR CAPACITY.
