AND THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN -- IDENTIFIED SO WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATORS APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF AB. TWO OH SIX WHICH WOULD PROTECT PROPERTY OWNERS FROM FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS IF THEY PARTICIPATE AND LEAD ABATEMENT. LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CAME OUT OF A LANDMARK LEGAL DECISION THAT FOUND LEAD PAINT COMPANIES LIABLE FOR KNOWINGLY PROFITING FROM PRODUCTS WITH DOCUMENT HEALTH RISKS IN CREATING A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE. THE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO A LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAM -- THESE LEADING COMPANIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THERE ERE TWO SENTENCES IN A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PAGE COURT CASE. THAT MIGHT LEAD TO LAWSUITS AGAINST HOMEOWNERS WHO CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. WHILE THOSE LAWSUITS WOULD BE FRIVOLOUS THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT COULD DETER PARTICIPATION BY THOSE HOMEOWNER SO THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT. PROPERTY OWNERS WHO CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE AND LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS TEND ORGANIZATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND ADVOCATES AND I APPRECIATE THE UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN COMMITTEE AND ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. TESTIFY JAMIE HEALING DELAY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS WELL AS TWENTY BILL HE WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION MISTER WHITE. GOOD AFTERNOON YOUR OF TWO MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS JAMIE HEALING TO LAMB ADEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ONE OF THE LAWYERS REPRESENTING. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE LEAD PAINT LAWSUIT THAT SPURRED THE SPELL. WE WON THIS CASE BECAUSE WE PROVED THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES KNOWINGLY MANUFACTURED DISTRIBUTED AND PROMOTED LEAD PAINT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT POISONED CHILDREN PERMANENTLY. THE LEAD PAINT THAT THEY PROMOTED A CENTURY AGO IS STILL IN HOMES IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR TEN JURISDICTIONS POISONING CHILDREN EVERY DAY OVER A THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE STILL POISONED BY LEAD PAINT. EVERY YEAR AND THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT THAT WE ONE REPRESENTS A ONCE AN OPPORTUNE ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY. TO READ THE STATE OF THE SCOURGE OF RESIDENTIAL LEAD PAINT. ONE OF THE HITCHES WITH THE JUDGMENT IS THAT WE HAVE FOR YEARS. IN WHICH TO SPEND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND IF WE DON'T SPEND THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WITH IN THAT FOR YEARS THE REMAINDER GOES BACK TO THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES. THIS CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES TO SUE HOMEOWNERS IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM WHICH IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO COME TO THE TEN JURISDICTIONS AND SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME IN AND OBEYED THE LEAD PAINT. IN OUR HOMES WE SAW LAST YEAR THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES ARE NOT ABOVE LYING TO HOMEOWNERS ABOUT THIS JUDGMENT IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION. LAST YEAR THEY WERE PAYING FOR ADVERTISEMENTS LYING ABOUT THIS JUDGMENT SAYING THAT IT WOULD RED TAG HOMES THAT HOMES WOULD BE DECLARED AND YOU SENSE. THAT HOME THE PEOPLE WOULD BE UNABLE TO GET MORTGAGES ALL OF THESE ARE PATENTLY FALSE AND IT'S PATENTLY FALSE THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES WOULD SUCCEED IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST THE HOMEOWNERS. BECAUSE THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES HAVE TAKEN TWO SENTENCES OUT OF THIS HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGE COURT CASE SAYING THAT THEY COULD BUT IN FACT THE VERY PAGE BEFORE THAT SAYS. THAT HOMEOWNERS WERE NOT JOINT PORT FEES THERE'S WITH DEFENDANTS. YOUR TEST FOR THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS TO PHONE SURE THANK YOU SIR NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES ONLY BE WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THE ONLY TWO ITEMS -- TO ADD IS IT IS THE ARE THIS -- THIS BOOK THE PROTECTION THIS BILL WILL GREATLY ENCOURAGEMENT TO POPULOUS PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AND I'M SURE THAT THERE'S NOT A CHILLING EFFECT -- OF THE THREAD A LAWSUIT. AND THERE'S ALSO NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT CHANGES EXISTING LAW AS IT RELATES TO MAINTENANCE OR SUBSTANDARD. CONDITIONS IT JUST HELPS ENSURE THIS PARTICIPATION THIS PROGRAM IN THIS FOUR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ENCOURAGE HER SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESS GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBER KATE ALLEN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION ARE OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS WE ABOUT HALF MILLIONS THE STATE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS A PROJECT OF CONAGRA AND SHERMAN WILLIAMS. WERE TWO DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE -- I'LL START BY FIRST ADDRESSING SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE SUPPORT TESTIMONY STIPULATED. MY CLIENTS LOST THIS CASE THEY ARE GOING TO PAY MONEY INTO A FUND THE CLEANUP HOMES. WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT? YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE FIRST DOLLAR IN. THERE WAS REFERENCE TO TWO LINES IN THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE TWO LINES HAVE MORE MEANING THAN -- THAN THESE FOLKS WOULD SUGGEST BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY TRADITIONAL TORT LAW. THIS IS AN ACT IN EQUITY. AND IN EQUITY IN THOSE ACTS THE RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION FOR OTHERS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HARM IS A NATURAL. IT IS PART OF THE ABILITY TO GO AND RECOVER TO CLEAN UP THAT HARM. THAT IS TRADITIONAL STE CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY IS WE SAY ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE WE'RE GONNA BRING YOU ALL AND WE'RE GONNA GET THE THING CLEANED UP AND THEN YOU FIGHT AMONGST YOURSELVES AS TO WHO PAYS FOR WHAT AND FOR HOW MUCH. ARE VALUE HERE IS GETTING THINGS CLEANED UP. WE LOST THE CASE WE ARE GOING TO PUT FIRST DOLLAR INTO THIS FUND TO CLEAN UP HOMES. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY FOR US TO GO AFTER FOLKS WHO HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE LAW? AND THAT'S SLUMLORDS. WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN SUING JOHN AND JANE SMITH LÃ  LIVING IN THEIR HOME. WHETHER THEY MAINTAINED THEIR HOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW ARE NOT. BUT THE ONLY FOLKS WHO BENEFIT FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ARE SLUMLORDS. AND ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SIGN UP. AND AND AND THEY ARE ABSOLVED FROM THERE. TYPICAL STATUTORY AND TOWARD REQUIREMENT. TO PAY FOR CONTRIBUTION FOR WHATEVER HARM THEY COST. THANK YOU THE YOUR TESTIMONY. THE FEDERAL TWO MINUTES THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS SO WILL ANTICIPATE THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NON -- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DÃ­AS I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE POINT I'D MENTION THERE WERE NO AMENDMENTS NONE THAT. THAT HAVEN'T ALREADY BEEN TAKEN AND TO CLARIFY -- THAT IN RESPONSE TO OUR CONCERNS JUST MIGHT -- ADD ALLOW PROPERTY. OWNERS OFF THE HOOK IMPROPERLY OR IMPACT TENANT REMEDIES FOR LEAD PAINT PROBLEMS THE AUTHOR DID AGREE TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT -- THAT MAKE CLEAR THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AND MAKES THE INTENT AND OPERATION OF THE BILL CLEAR I BELIEVE SAYING. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT ALTER EXISTING OBLIGATIONS ON HOMEOWNERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY UNDER APPLICABLES LAW. IN OTHERWISE LIMITED TENANTS LEGAL REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT ON A DWELLING SO I THINK THAT CLARIFIES. EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF RATS AND PEOPLE'S PROPERTY THIS IS A LEAD PAINT CLEANUP BILL AND I THINK THAT IF THERE WERE. ANY CONFUSION THAT THIS LANGUAGE WHICH THE AUTHOR GRACIOUSLY AGREED TO TAKE A CLARIFIES THAT SO. WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM DYSON -- BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK IT'S A MATTER POLICY MOST IF NOT ALL FOLKS WOULD WOULD WOULD AGREE THAT YOU NEED TO INCENTIVIZE. FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. AND THIS PROGRAM -- WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE -- I HAVE TWO LITTLE BOYS AND THE IDEA OF CHIPPING PAINT ON IT EVEN THOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED. GIVEN THE HISTORICAL-- THREATS -- BYE BYE LE BASED PRODUCTS IT'S STILL SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED BE MINDFUL OF SO I THINK IT'S A MATTER POLICY. THIS IS A GOOD THING. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH ON SOME POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION SO. IF THE IF HOMEOWNERS -- OR PROPERTY OWNERS PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM DO THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION. OUR THROUGH THIS PROGRAM TO BE LEGALLY ABSOLVED HIM PROTECTED. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE SIR. THREE NO YOU YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN APPLY TO BE PART OF THE PROGRAM YOU CAN GO THROUGH PART OF THE PROGRAMYOU CAN COMPLETE THE PROGRAM BUT HE WOULD HAVE IMMUNITY FOR THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH YOU ARE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WE TO FIND. THAT TO BE PARTICIPATING IN ANY PART OF THE PROGRAM. IS THAT SEEM [inaudible] ADEQUATE. SO IF I'M A PROPERTY OWNER AND I HAVE. SOME CONCERNS AND I JUST TAKE MY SWEET TIME. IN GOING THROUGH AN ABATEMENT A REMEDIATION PROGRAM BUT I AM ABSOLVED FOR THE DURATION. THAT I AM MAKING EFFORTS. DOES THAT SEEM LIKE IT GOES FAR ENOUGH. SO WE COULD SAY THAT THE IMMUNITY THAT WERE ESTABLISHING WITH THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW IT IS ONLY LIMITED TO LAWSUITS AGAINST OWNERS AND PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT ARE SEEKING TO RECOVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS. BUT THEY'RE STILL EXPOSED TO OTHER POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND SO I WOULD. I I I I DO UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S TRYING TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW LEAVE THINGS OPEN TO SLAM ARTS AND AND LET ME JUST SAY. I FOR ONE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE WORKING ON THIS BILL. THAT WOULD WANT TO DEFEND THE ABILITY OF SOME WORDS TO RECEIVE ANY MORE PROTECTION. THAN THEY SHOULD. ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THERE IS A POT OF MONEY AND WE WANT TO HAVE MAKE PEOPLE. MAKE THIS PART OF MONEY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WE DON'T% WANT TO SCARE OFF POTENTIAL INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE WHAT THE PAIN COMPANIES ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BRING. LAWSUITS AGAINST HOMEOWNERS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND THE REASON WE PUT IN THE LANGUAGE THAT. THE CHAIR ONE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAD PUT FORTH IS TO MAKE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE SLUMLORDS A MISTER MOFFETT IS REFERRING TO WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED UNDER OUR BILL. THIS SECTION SHALL NOT ALTER EXISTING OBLIGATIONS OF HOMEOWNERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR OTHERWISE LIMIT ATTENDANCE LEGAL REMEDIES -- WE WANNA MAKE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE VERY LIMITED IMMUNITY IS REALLY TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE IF WE% DON'T. THE OPPOSITES GONNA HAPPEN THE FORMER MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO SIT THERE NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND THEN ALL THIS AND WE'RE GONNA BE BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED. ME COULD GO AHEAD AND IF -- I'M TRYING TO REFINE TO MAKE CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEIR LIVES OF I'M SUPPORTIVE I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I'D. APPRECIATE. OF THE POLICY THAT WE'RE MOVING ON TODAY. SO A PROPERTY OWNER THAT PARTICIPATES IN THIS PROGRAM. SURE WHEN WILLIAMS BY EXAMPLE TRIES TO COME AFTER THEM. BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING. EXCEPT REGISTERED TO BE PART OF THIS ABATEMENT PROGRAM. THEY'RE PROTECTED BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMPLETE THE ABATEMENT. IN THEIR STILL GIVEN DE. EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY IS THAT-CORRECT SO IF I COULD JUST AND CLEAR AGAIN THE FIRST SECTION OF THIS OF THIS BILL SAYS A RESPONSIBLE PARTY IF. IF THERE'S A LAWSUIT WERE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES SEEKING TO RECOVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAD PAINT MEANT ABATEMENT PROGRAM. SO IT'S RELATED TO THE PROGRAM WE'RE NOT SAYING OTHER THINGS FOR SAN RELATED TO THE PROGRAM. SO IN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS SHERMAN WILLIAMS WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT HOMEOWNER BECAUSE THE HOME OWNER RECEIVED SOME BENEFIT FROM THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR SAY. TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR WAS WAS SPENT ON THEIR HOME SURE WILL MILLIONS IS SUING THEM TO SAY YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT YOU NEED TO PASS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK THAT WE PUT INTO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR POT. IF A HOMEOWNER JUST SIGNED UP FOR THE PROGRAM AND NEVER ACTUALLY. RECEIVED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ABATEMENT THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GROUNDS FOR THE SUIT BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO FUNDS FOR SURE WILLIAMS TO SEE TO GET BACK. SO. IF A LOOK AT THE CHILD. INGESTED A CHIP MAN GOT SICK IN THE PROPERTY OWNER. ODD THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PROPERTY -- SHARON WILLIAMS TRIES TO SUE NOT FOR THE COLLECTION OF THE DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABATEMENT BUT SOME SORT OF PERCENTILE OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE. ARE YOU SAYING THIS PROTECTS SUMMER DOESN'T PROTECT. THAT CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ADDRESSED BY THE BILL THAT'S LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSONAL INJURY LAWSUIT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHO PAID INTO THIS FUND OR GOT MONEY OUT OF THIS FUND BUT NOT IS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED IN THAT SITUATION I THINK THAT. THE LANGUAGE WE PUT IN THEIR CLARIFY SAID SO ALL THAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REFERS TO IF PEOPLE DO ACTUALLY ACCESS MONEY FROM THIS FUND FOR ABATEMENT PURPOSES. THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE SURE WHEN WILLIAMS OR WHOEVER THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE WHAT TO PUT THE MONEY AND THEY HAVE TO THEY WILL. BE REQUIRED TO PAY THAT MONEY AND THEY THEN CANNOT TURN AROUND ANDSUE TO GET THE MONEY BACK. HAVING FOR THAT PURPOSE. ALL RIGHT NEXT -- THE REBEL POSES -- TO TO THE OPPOSITION -- SOMETIMES WHEN INDIVIDUALS-- ARE ARE SUED THEY JUST PICKED THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT AND SAID LOOK SOUNDS AS IF YOUR CLIENTS WERE THE RIGHT THIS FRUIT CONAGRA AND SHERMAN WILLIAMS -- THOSE ARE THE TWO ENTITIES DEEMED RESPONSIBLE FOR AN INDUSTRY WIDE PROBLEM. THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE CONFRONTING. ES BEARING ALL THIS WEIGHT. IS HOW EXACTLY YOU GO OUT. AND TRY TO DRAW FOLKS INTO A DRAGNET TO SHARE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY THOSE SUCCESSOR ENTITIES THAT HAD PREDECESSORS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE LEAD PAINT INDUSTRY. WAY BACK IN TIME IS THAT IF. A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF WHERE YOU'RE AT I WOULD SAY THAT THE ISSUE THAT WE FACE IN THIS BILL. IS THAT YOU KNOW AND AND TO SOME EXTENT ALL AGREE WITH WITH THE FOLKS WHO. YOU KNOW WHO THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE. WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN IN SUING HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THEIR HOMES WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE LAW. THERE'S THERE'S NO LAWSUIT THERE THERE'S NO CONTRIBUTION ACTION THERE AND IF THE BILL WAS LIMITED JUST TO THAT. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE AN ISSUE. BUT WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES IS IT SAYS A SLUM LORD WHO HAS THUMB THEIR NOSE AT THE LAW. DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE HARM. IS ABSOLVED FROM ANY FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT CURRENT LAW WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DATE AND THAT IS WHAT THE LAW SAYS SO WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON I THINK WE'VE ESTABLISHED WHAT THE LAW DEALS WITH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK AND RE LITIGATE THE CASE YOU FOLKS LOST THE CASE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS THAT FUND THAT IS AVAILABLE AND IT'S AVAILABLE FOR A VERY LIMITED SPECIFIC PURPOSE IT'S AVAILABLE ONLY TO THOSE WHO ACCESS THE FUN. TO DO ABATEMENT IF THEY ONLY ACCESS TO TO THE TUNE OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN IT'S A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR CLEANUP. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE THANK COMPANIES CANNOT THREATEN TO SUE THEM EITHER FOR THAT MONEY OR FOR ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY SO I THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RE LITIGATE THE OTHER SHORE ONLY GO TO ADDRESS THE BILL AT HAND. AND FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT AMENDMENT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOOK I THINK CLARIFIES THE LIMITATIONS AND THE LIMITED SCOPE. OF THIS BILLS WILL GO ON TO MISTER STIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANKS FOR CONTINUOUS LOG WITH THIS ISSUE -- WE WERE IN AND SORT OF STATE OF UNCERTAINTY OF THE END OF LAST SESSION AND I WANTED ON THE ONE HAND I'M I'M GLAD THE LITIGATION WORKED OUT-THE WAY IT DID BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME CERTAINTY NOW AND EVERYONE WAS SCARED FRANKLY INVENTOR COUNTY IN LA IN BACK. HOME AND I DO I RESENT THE THREATS THAT WERE. LEVIED AT THE END OF SESSION. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT FOR UNDER MILLIONS OUT ENOUGH. UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS BIGGER AND I KNOW THAT THAT SORT OF THE NATURE OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENTS. I'M WONDERING I'M MUCH LESS INTERESTED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE OPPOSITION MUCH LESS INTERESTED IN. A MECHANISM FOR REIMBURSING THEIR LIABILITY THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A NON STARTER BUT BUT THE THE IDEA THAT. THERE COULD BE OTHERS LIABLE OUT THERE -- AND THAT THAT COULD ACTUALLY SUPPLEMENT THE FUND HAVE YOU HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO THAT I KNOW I JUST. I WE WERE POKING AROUND BEFORE THE HEARING IN JUST. BRAINSTORMING LIKE [inaudible] THE THE THE AMENDMENT DE THAT THE COMMITTEE ADDED THAT ALLOWS FOR TENANTS LEGAL REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING PRESENCE OF OF LEAD PAINT. BUT IF THERE WERE SOME OTHER MECHANISM BEYOND JUST THE TENANTS SEEKING THAT RECOURSE. AND TRYING TO GET BACK TO GO INTO EITHER A LOCAL JURISDICTION OR THE FUND OVER ALL -- FROM SORT OF ADDITIONAL BAD ACTORS OUT THERE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS OF THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL IS THERE SOME WAY. TO GO FURTHER IN OTHER WORDS NOT JUST LIMIT IS THE FOUR HUNDRED BUT THEN SAY -- AS A UP A PROPERTY OWNER WHO IS NOT TAKING CARE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IF THEY WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THOSE EXPENSES AND THEN THAT WOULD THEN SUPPLEMENT. WHAT THE BOOK? WE BE ARTICULATING HERE AS WELL AS IN THE LITIGATION. YOU GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IDEA I THINK I ANSWER THE QUESTION -- IN THE FLY AWAY WHICH IS YOU AND I AND CENTER HERTZBERG AND OTHER COLLEAGUES OF MINE THE ASSEMBLY WE SPENT SOME TIME LAST YEAR TRYING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN. THE TWO SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND I THINK. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE COULD BROADEN THE POT INVOLVE MORE -- MORE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS -- HELP MORE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THE PLAINTIFFS IS SOMETHING I THINK WE WOULD ALL WANT. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF LITIGATION -- THAT HAVE LASTED FOR TWENTY YEARS AS A LEAD PAINT COMPANIES WERE FIGHTING THIS OFF -- WE WERE UNABLE TO GET TO A PLACE I FOR ONE WOULD BE OPEN TO THINKING IF THERE WAS UP A BROADER OPPORTUNITY BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US WITH THE BILL. THE QUESTION WE HAVE INFORMACIÃ³N THE BILL IT IS IT IS LIKELY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS THERE WILL BE A COURT SETTLEMENT AND THE CLOCK WILL START TAKING THERE WILL BE FOR YEARS. TO SPECIFIC FOR FOR FOR HOMEOWNERS TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT FUND AND IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THAT MONEY WILL REVERT BACK TO THE COMPANIES. THAT FOR DECADES KNOWINGLY PROFITED OFF A POISONING KITS AND IN THAT INSTANCE WE WANT TO ENSURE. THAT HOMEOWNERS. BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO GET SUED BY THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION TODAY BUT TO YOUR POINT IF WE COULD HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION I WILL SUITABLE SITES I'M OPEN IN THAT CONVERSATION WE GET THERE BUT THAT ISN'T THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN I APPRECIATE. THE DISCUSSION THAT THE BILL BEFORE US IS ON A VERY LIMITED. SET OF FACTS AND OF THE RESOLUTION THAT WE ANTICIPATE -- OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SO MY ONLY POINT MADAM CHAIR WAS THAT THE THE THE LIMITATION ON LIABILITY MAY KEEP. POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS -- OFF THE TABLE THAT WE COULD OTHERWISE BE ADDING TO THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE CONCERN SO SO WITHIN THE NARROW SCOPE OF THE BILL. I GET WE DON'T WANT. OPEN ANY LITIGATION PREDATORY LITIGATION WAYS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE PROGRAM BUT IF IF WE WERE ABLE TO GO. AND FIND OTHER BAD ACTORS AND AND AND SORT OF KEEP THEM WITHIN THE SCOPE OF DE THAT YOU ADDED. AND MAKE SURE THOSE LEGAL REMEDIES COULD STILL CONTRIBUTE A BROADER FIND ANYWAY I CAN BE A CONTINUED CONVERSATION  THANK YOU FOR THAT INDULGENCE CERTAINLY. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT -- CAN WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW UP THINK YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT BUT FEEL FREE I'D I'D I THINK I'VE MADE A POINT A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION OF THIS THIS HAS BEEN. A LONG STANDING ISSUE AND AGAIN AS WE SAID BEFORE WE'RE TRYING TO JUST INSURE A VERY NARROW CAR ABOUT UP FROM UNITY FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SO THAT THEY DON'T -- BEAR THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY BEING SUED ONE LAWSUIT AGAINST ONE HOMEOWNER COULD HAVE ENORMOUS REPERCUSSIONS OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO VOTE HERE WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THERE IS A MOTION BY SENATOR WHY CAO SKI IN THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE SENATE HE Q.. N. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HIGH JACKSON AYE BORDERS. BORDERS AYE ALLEN. ALLEN AYE CABALLERO CABALLERO AYE JONES. JONES I AM MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN. STERN I AM BURKE. BY CASKEY I GUESS HE I THANK YOU CENTER SITE THAT THE BILL HAS EIGHT VOTES WE WILL HOLD THE ROLL OVER FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBER THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS. FILE ITEM THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RAMOS. THAT IS AB [inaudible] ELEVEN TWENTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I PRESENT TO YOU AT ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH ENSURES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN HIS OFFICE RECEIVE NOTICE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS. PROP SIXTY FIVE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES A BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES CONSUMERS TO CHEMICALS LISTED. ARE AS CARCINOGENS OR REPPERT REPRODUCTIVE REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS MUST FIRST PROVIDE CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROP PROP SIXTY FIVE PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN ENFORCE THE STATUTE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO COMPLY THE CITIZENS MUST BEEN SENT A NOTICE TO AN ALLEGED VIOLATOR AND TO THE AG'S. OFFICE ADVISING OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. PRIVATE ENFORCERS MUST ALSO REPORT TO THE AG'S OFFICE WHEN THEY FILE A COMPLAINT OR SETTLEMENT. THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE CLAIMS THAT ASSURE THE PRIVATE ENFORCERS CLAIMS HAVE MERIT. AND THAT PRIVATE LAWSUITS AND SETTLEMENTS ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER. THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THE PRIVATE ENFORCERS ARE DEFENDANTS REPORT. ON ANY OF THESE PROP SIXTY FIVE ACTIVITIES. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INCLUDING ONE IN THE PEEL IS FILED. AS A RESULT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MAY BE UNAWARE OF PENDING. AND THE COURT OF APPEALS ARE FREQUENTLY ASKED TO PINE ON THE LONG WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INPUT. RISKING A PRESIDENTIAL DECISION DAMAGING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE OFFERS A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY LITIGATION. THAT COULD ESTABLISH STATEWIDE PRECEDENT REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION OF PROP [inaudible] SIXTY FIVE IT'S ONLY. APPROPRIATE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BE AWARE OF APPEALS REGARDING PROP SIXTY FIVE AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MARIO THE BUT NOT THE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON AS CHAIR MARIO DIBERNARDO HERE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HOBBY OF THE CERAS PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL REQUIRES UP -- PRIVATE ENFORCERS WHO APPEAL A PROP SIXTY FIVE CASE TO PROVIDE NOTICE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHEN THEY'RE FILING THAT APPEAL. WE DO OUR BEST TO FOLLOW PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS -- BUT OCCASIONALLY SOME FALL UNDER THE RADAR AND THE REALITY IS THAT NOT ALL PRIVATE ENFORCERS ARE THE THE BEST ATTORNEYS AND THEY MAY MAKE ARGUMENTS THAT COULD HARM STATE INTERESTS AND SO IF WE'RE NOT ENGAGE IN THOSE PROCEEDINGS. AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILE AN AMICUS BRIEF TO HELP GUIDE THE THE DECISION OFTENTIMES THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE DECISION -- TO THE STATE AND AND TWO RECENT CASES WE HAD TO PETITION FOR D. PUBLICATION. SO INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH IT ON THE BACK AND WE'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH IT ON THE FRONT AND BY HAVING THIS NOTICE ARE VERY SIMILAR PROVISIONS IN THE DISABILITY LAWS UNFAIR COMPETITION SEQUEL AND FALSE CLAIMS IN THIS ESSENTIALLY DOES THE SAME THING. THAT THOSE PROGRAMS -- PROVIDE SO WTH THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. MARCHING IN HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS ANY QUESTIONS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING THE BILL.

TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS FILE ITEM [inaudible] NINE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR STONE. FILE ITEM [inaudible] NINE AND MY UNDERSTANDING THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AND THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THIS IS A BIT OF A CLEAN UP BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE GERALD FORD'S F. T.. C. PROPOSED AND IMPLEMENTED WITH A CALL THE HOLDER RULE. SO THAT THE HOLDER OF A FINANCING CONTRACT FOR A AN ITEM THAT WAS SOLD TO A CONSUMER BUT AN ITEM THAT WAS SOLD UNDER FRAUDULENT TERMS. THE HOLDER OF THAT. FINANCING WOULD ALSO BE LIABLE FOR THAT FOR THAT FRAUDULENT SALE SO FOR EXAMPLE. A LEMON VEHICLE. HAVING FLOOD DAMAGE SO BY USED CAR SALES PERSON. THAN THAT. FINANCING AGENCY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE BY. THE VICTIM OF THAT CRIME -- OR OF OF THAT FRIED WHAT THIS DID WAS IT INSURED THAT THERE WAS A REMEDY IN THE CASES WHERE FLY BY NIGHTERS SMALLER. FRAUDULENT SELLERS WENT OUT OF BUSINESS AND THE FINANCING COMPANIES THAT WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ONLY DEALING WITH RAPPER REPUTABLE VENDORS. WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR THIRD THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS? TURN THIS AROUND AND INTERPRETED THE HOLDER RULE TO REQUIRE THAT ATTORNEYS FEES BE PAID OUT OF THAT SETTLEMENT WHICH MEANS NOW IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. FOR ANYONE TO FIND TOURNEY BEING WILLING TO TAKE UP THAT CASE SO THIS BILL DOES IS IT RESETS. THE THE RULE TO HOW IT HAD BEEN INTERPRETED AND HOW DID BEEN USED IN CALIFORNIA FOR FORTY SOME ODD YEARS AND THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION VEHICLE THAT WE WOULD LIKE. TO PUT BACK THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED TO BE DONE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEIGHBORHOODS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NO WHICH IS GOOD. THE YES VERY GOOD -- MY NAME IS LYNN HARRIS I'M HERE MY WIFE CRYSTAL IN OUR THREE CHILDREN WE LIVE IN BAKERSFIELD I'M A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY CURRENTLY WORKING AS A MAINTENANCE MECHANIC UP -- PEPSICO. WHEN YOUR GOAL CRYSTAL IN -- IN -- WINTER CAR DEALERSHIP EXPRESS AUTO SALES IN BAKERSFIELD WE BOUGHT A TWO THOUSAND THREE CHEVY SUBURBAN 460-003-0050 DOLLARS. WE MADE A DOWN PAYMENT OF EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY A FINE AS THE REST DEALERSHIP TOLD US THAT THEY WOULD REGISTER THE SUBURBAN WITH THE DMV AND SEND US A PERMIT LICENSE -- LICENSE PLATES WE PAY THE DEALERSHIP A DOCUMENT. FEE AND REGISTRATION FEE AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS IN THE MEANTIME TO GIVE US A TEMPORARY STICK WITH THE VEHICLE. IDENTIFICATION NUMBER PLACED IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND PLATES WITH THE JUST THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP. MONTHS WENT BY AND WE STILL DIDN'T GET THE PERMANENT LICENSE PLATES WE CALL THE DEALERSHIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT NO ANSWER -- THEY DIDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE. FINALLY WE CALL THE BANK THAT THE DEALERSHIP GOT TO OUR GOT TO FINANCE OUR LOAN AND THAT WE'VE BEEN PAYING EVER SINCE WESTLAKE FINANCIAL. THE BANK TOLD US THE DEALERSHIP WENT OUT OF BUSINESS IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THREE MONTHS BEFORE WE EVEN BOUGHT THE CAR. WHY DID THE FINANCE ALONE MADE BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT WAS OUT OF BUSINESS THE BANK TOLD US THE TO SIGN US BUT -- SIGNED OVER POWER OF ATTORNEY SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE CAR REGISTERED IN SENATE'S PERMANENT PLATES SO WE DID BUT THEN THEY TOLD US THAT THE IT COULD TAKE UP TO TEN MONTHS FOR DMV TO PROCESS THE DOCUMENTS. WORST OF ALL I WHEN I WHILE I WAS DRIVING TO WORK RECENTLY THE SIEGE BE PULLED ME OVER. THEY NOTICED THAT I WAS DRIVING WITH TEMPORARY STICKER THAT HAD EXPIRED AND MY CAR WAS IMPOUNDED. THE SIEGE BE ALSO SAID THAT THERE WAS OVER A YEAR OF BACK FEES ALL TO THE DMV THAT EXPRESS AUTO SALES NEVER PAID. THEY SAID WE HAD TO PAY THE DMV THOSE EXTRA FEES BEFORE THEM FROM BEFORE WE EVEN BOUGHT THE CAR BEFORE IT WOULD BE REGISTERED IN OUR NAMES WE CAN AFFORD TO PAY DMV. THOSE UNEXPECTED FEES THAT WERE DISCLOSED WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR ON TOP OF WHAT WE ALREADY PAINT WE'RE WE'RE READING. IN THE BANK I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE HEFTY IMPOUND FEES WHICH ARE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS I ALSO CAN GET THE CAR OUT OF IMPOUND BECAUSE I'M NOT THE REGISTERED OWNER. EVEN IF I GOT THE CAR OUT OF IMPOUND I COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET IT REGISTERED SO I MAY GET PULLED OVER OR TAKE IT AGAIN. MEANWHILE I HAVE TO KEEP PAYING WESTLAKE FINANCIAL ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR ELSE MY CREDIT WILL BE RUINED IN A REPOSSESSION STAYS ON A CREDIT REPORT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND CAN BE A VERY TO GET ANOTHER CAR BETTER JOB OR HOUSING. THIS YEAR'S HARDSHIP FOR ME AND MY FAMILY TO BE WITHOUT A CAR THERE.

THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE INTERIOR OF THE UNITED STATES SIGNED IN JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALLOWS AYE SEES ALL EXECUTIVE BANCH AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IN AIDING AND ASSISTING WITH THE REST. THOSE PRICES INCLUDES -- THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HUMAN ADMINISTRATION OR OSHA. ON AND THEY HAVE BEEN USED BY ICE TO MAKE ARRESTS. THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER RE AUTHORIZES THE USE OF THIS AND OTHER AGENCIES IN MAKING IMMIGRATION RELATED ARREST. IN DOING SO THEY ARE IN PLAIN TACTICS IN SAVE SPACES WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT COURTHOUSES BUT IS NOT THE ONLY FACE OVERSEEING. THE SERVICE HAPPEN AN INDIAN SO THEY'RE PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK ARE INSTEAD OF HAVING INDIVIDUALS. RING THE ALARM LÃ  THE WHISTLE AND LET US KNOW WHEN THERE'S PLANS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THERE ARE FATED CUMPLE WARD. NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BUT AND IN THE PROCESS NOT PROTECTING OTHERS. THESE USES UNDERMINE THE TRUST BETWEEN THESE COME BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE AGENCIES THAT I MEAN TO KEEP ALL OF US SAFE. BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE HAPPENING WE'RE SEEING HEALTH VIOLATIONS AND OTHER SERIOUS INJURIES NOT GO REPORTED TO OSHA AND OTHER AGENCIES. WE ARE CALLING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW THIS PRACTICE -- AND ABANDON IT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS DOING THEIR JOB IN KEEPING ALL OF U SAFE ALONG THE WAY. WE'VE WORKED HERE IN THE HOUSE AND WE ALSO TRY TO OUR AGE -- EYES IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW THEY USED -- POLICE OFFICERS OR FOLKS WHO IMPERSONATE POLICE OFFICERS AND OTHER WAS THAT'S OUT THERE.

GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS AND JERRY RIVERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. AJ ARE NINE URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CEASE USING BRUCE'S AGAINST IMMIGRANTS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LIVE IN. ADDITIONALLY IT ASKS THAT THEY CEASE -- UNJUST DETENTION AND DEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. AND IT OVER ASKS THE ICE OFFICERS THE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT A STANDARD UNIFORM THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIES THEM. ICE AGENTS FREQUENTLY OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE TACTICS THAT THEY USE SUCH AS FAILING -- TO USE JUDICIAL WARRANT -- IMPERSONATING A PERSON'S FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMETIMES -- FAKING FAMILY EMERGENCIES TO LOWER INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE ADDITIONALLY -- WE HAVE HEARD OF CASES WHERE -- LOCAL POLICE ARE IMPERSONATED BY ICE OFFICERS AS WELL. ICE AGENTS FREQUENTLY WHERE BASS THAT LABEL -- POLICE AND THEY SERVE ON JOINT TASK FORCES WITH LOCAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AS WELL. THESE PRACTICES NOT ONLY A ROAD PUBLIC TRUST BUT THEY ALSO A ROAD THE TRUST IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THESE TACTICS ARE ULTIMATELY. ULTIMATELY GOING TO THREATEN THE SAFETY OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES IF WE CAN'T TRUST THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT PATROL US. WHILE THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN CERTAINLY DO MORE -- SUCH AS AJ ARE NINE TO pWE DO HAVE IN PLACE PROTECT ALL OF US. AJ ARE NINE IS IN LINE WITH CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND IT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CALIFORNIA WILL STAND BY ITS IMMIGRANTS AND WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE WITHOUT FEAR. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AJ ARE. NINE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

JUST AN OBSERVATION IS A FORMER PROSECUTOR ALTHOUGH A LONG TIME AGO -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT% THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATES -- OWN EFFECTIVELY ONLY WHEN IT OPERATES IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THERE IS TRUST. AND OF PEOPLE WON'T COME FORWARD. THEY WON'T AGREE TO TESTIFY THEY WON'T AGREE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO ARE -- ENDANGERING THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS IF THEY THEMSELVES ARE AFRAID AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND I TING ADJUSTING ANECDOTALLY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND CERTAINLY IN COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT WHICH OF A STRONG -- LATINO POPULATION PEOPLE ARE JUST AFRAID AND THEY'VE GONE UNDERGROUND AND WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN CRIME BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO COME FORWARD. THEY'RE BEING THREATENED SO THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. WHETHER IT'S IN THE FORM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT A HARASSMENT DOOR. ANY ANY OTHER FORM OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR AND IT'S THIS KIND OF FEAR THAT ICE HAS. BEEN PERPETUATING WHETHER IT'S INTENTIONAL OR NOT IT'S CERTAINLY REAL AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BRING THIS. FORWARD TO OUR ATTENTION AND AGAIN TO TRY. TO TO CALL UPON. OF ICE TO BEHAVE IN A WAY WHICH SOME OF US WOULD ARGUE IS. MORE CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES AS A NATION AND AS A PEOPLE SO. THAT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
