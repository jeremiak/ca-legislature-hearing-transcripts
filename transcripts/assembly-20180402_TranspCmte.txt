COMMITTEE IS NOW CALLED ORDER. WE'RE GONNA START AS A SUB COMMITTEE AS WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. HOW MISTER OBERNOLTE? YOUR FIRST UP. SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT YOU PRESENT WITH AB TWO TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE FIRST. THEN YOU'RE A FALL FALL FOR THE OTHER BILL. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU SIR. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WE ARE AS A SOCIETY WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY ARE RELYING ON AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST IN ISSUING VIOLATIONS OF OUR TRAFFIC SAFETY LAWS. AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS RECENTLY HAS BEEN. THE AUTOMATIC ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS FOR TOLLING VIOLATIONS WHICH HAS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS IN RECENT YEARS. A NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING THAT WILL ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ENFORCE. HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES OCCUPANCY RULES WITH. SOME AUTOMATION AND IT'S REALLY REMARKABLE TECHNOLOGY USES A COMBINATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING. TO BE ABLE TO IN AN AUTOMATED WAY DETERMINE HOW MANY OCCUPANTS THEY ARE IN A CAR. AND ISSUE A VIOLATION AUTOMATICALLY IF THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS DOES NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR THE HIGH OCCUPANCY LIAM IN WHICH VEHICLES TRAVELING SO. RECENT STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS ABOUT A NINETY FIVE PERCENT ACCURACY RATE. AND ABOUT A ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT PAUSES TO A FALSE POSITIVE RATE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S IS THAT IS REMARKABLE ACCURACY I DON'T THINK THAT A HUMAN. COULD DO EQUALLY WELL IF THEY SPENT A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME ON EACH PHOTOGRAPH IS THESE ARE MACHINES DO HOWEVER THAT IS SMALL CONSOLATION IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONE AND TWENTY. PEOPLE THAT WERE ISSUED ONE OF THE CITATIONS THAT REALLY DON'T DESERVE TO BE ISSUED A CITATION. SO CURRENT STATE LAW REQUIRES CERTAIN INFORMATION BE GIVEN TO A CONSUMER ALONG WITH THE VIOLATION THAT WAS GENERATED IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION. AND THIS BILL. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL. ANTI REQUIREMENT THAT IF THE AUTOMATED TICKET IS ISSUED FOR A HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE VIOLATION THAT THAT VIOLATION NOTICE ALSO INCLUDE THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE VIOLATION. AND THIS IS GOING TO DO TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT'S GOING TO INCREASE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. OF THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HARD TO ARGUE WITH SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN A PICTURE OF YOUR VEHICLE YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE VEHICLE AND YOU WERE IN THE HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE AND THAT'S PRETTY HARD ARGUMENT. WITH BUT THE OTHER THING IT WILL DO IS IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE. FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ISSUED A VIOLATION IN ERROR IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A TOOL TO CONTEST THE VIOLATION WHICH I THINK IS ONLY FAIR SO I HOPE THIS IS WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. AND I GO OUT ON AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL NO SIR. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF YOUR. THE POOR THE AUTHORS BILL. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. OR SHARE AN OPINION ON THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION. WELL THAT'S OKAY FIFTY. SO I'LL SAYS WHERE'S WHICH I TO CLOSE IT'S WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SOMEONE ONE THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND HAVE A QUORUM THAT BILL. WAS THAT IF YOU DISABILITIES HAD INSTALLED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STE IN THE SPACES IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO RESTRICT THE USE OF THOSE SPACES. PART TWO ONLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES HOWEVER THOUGHT THAT IGNORES A COUPLE OF ITEMS OF STANDING PRACTICE IN STATE CODE ONE OF WHICH IS THAT. VEHICLES WITH. WELL I'LL MEET WITH A HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE PARKING PLACARDS ARE ALREADY. ALLOWED TO PARK IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RESTRICTED PARKING SITUATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PARK IN METERED PARKING WITHOUT PAYING THE METER THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PARK IN LIMITED DURATION PARKING SUCH AS A LOADING ZONE. WITHOUT A OBEYING THOSE LIMITS AND THEY'RE ALSO ALLOWED TO PARK IN RESTRICTED PARKING AREAS FOR THINGS LIKE. TENANTS ONLY PARKING FOR A BUILDING THAT WORRY IS CERTAIN BUSINESS ONLY PARKING SO WE ESTABLISHED THOSE THOSE. THOSE EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONSUMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE VEHICLE SPACES. AND ALL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE DONE I AS PRACTICE IN THIS LEGISLATURE SO THIS BILL SIMPLY. ESTABLISHES A VERY NARROWLY TAILORED EXEMPTION TO THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ONLY PARKING SPACES. NOT ONLY IN THE CASES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE DRAFT. BOB OR WITH A LEFT FOR A. A WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLE AND ONLY IN THE OCCASIONS WHERE THAT SPACE IS BEING USED FOR VEHICLE USING THOSE DEVICES TO ON MOTOR OFF LOSE. AN OCCUPANT WITH A WHEELCHAIR SO IT'S A VERY NARROWLY TAILORED DECEPTION AND I WOULD HOPE WOULD BE WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MEMBER DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES WERE YOUR BILL YES I DO. PLEASE IT TO A STATUE NAME IN THE REPRESENT PLEASE. JENNIFER HANNAH HELL WITH READING ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE TAXI CAB PARA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I'M IT'S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT MANY TAXI COMPANIES ARE THE PAIR TRANSIT PROVIDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT'S OFTEN TAXI COMPANIES THAT ARE CONTRACTED WITH. THAT CONTRACT WITH REGIONAL CENTERS OR HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE PAIR TRAINED TRANSIT SERVICES AND HAVE VEHICLES EQUIPPED THAT. AT SUCH MENTIONED IN THIS BILL. I AB TWENTY EIGHT OH SIX IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WILL ALLOW THE BEST USE OF THOSE THE OFTEN LIMITED SPACE AVAILABLE FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING DISABLED TRAVELERS AND WE REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OR VOICE AN OPINION ON THE OTHERS. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. MR. CITIZENSHIP. AND TAKE YOUR MISTER CHAIR THIS IS JUST FOR. LOADING AND UNLOADING. NOT FOR AN EXTENDED. TIME OF PARK IN THAT SPACE ARE. NOT EXACTLY IT ALLOWS PARKING IN A SPACE. ONLY INDICATIONS WELL WHERE THE VEHICLES BEING USED TO LOAD AND UNLOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE. BY HANDICAP PERSON WITH A WHEELCHAIR WORK TO USE ONE OF THE SPACES USING RAP TO OFFLOAD THEIR WHEELCHAIR GO INTO A BUSINESS FREQUENT THE BUSINESS AND THEN COME BACK OUT. TO THE VEHICLE COULD BE PART IN THAT SPACE FOR THE DURATION. NO I DO HAVE A LITTLE RESERVATION ABOUT THIS HIGH I MEAN THIS IS REALLY A WELL INTENDED THROUGH THE VEIL. AND THE. TO PROVIDE MORE PARKING SPACE FOR THE DISABLED COMMUNITY. I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL BUT BECAUSE. IT IS ALSO CRITICAL TO PROVIDE CHARGING SYSTEM FOR A LOT OF FOR. THOSE OF YOU BE OR OR OR CARS AND AND AND DO DIRECT VISION COMES HAVE SO THEY'RE EQUALLY. CRITICAL TO ME THE RESERVATIONS BECOME MAN BECAUSE. WHAT PAY SO MUCH MONEY FOR THE CHARGING CSUS THIS THE SYSTEM? WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HELP THAT PASSED USE. I MEAN TO MAKE MORE PARKING SPACE HANDICAP PARKING SPACE AVAILABLE I'M I'M TOTALLY YOU IN THE AGREE WITH IT. BUT TO PUT A VERY EXPRESSIVE SPACE AND AND THEN LIMITED USE BY THE EVENING IS. IT'S WORTH IT WHO RESERVATION COMES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMAN I SHARE YOUR RESERVATION AND THAT IS WHY WE TOOK SUCH CARE TO SO NARROWLY. A TAILOR THE BILL. NOT ONLY FOR THOSE CERTAIN TYPES OF VEHICLES AND I WE HAD ANOTHER MOTIVATION FOR DOING THAT WHICH IS THAT A RECENT APPELLATE COURT DECISION HAS ESTABLISHED THAT. CITIES HAVE LIABILITY UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ON ST HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE PARKING. SO THE EXEMPTIONS FOR OTHER KINDS OF VEHICULAR SPACES FOR THOSE KINDS OF USES HELP CITIES AVOID THAT KIND OF LIABILITY AND WE'RE ALSO HOPING TO HELP THEM AVOID THE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE EVEN ONLY SPACES. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE TARA WOULD TEAR TAYLOR DID SO NEARLY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER OBERNOLTE WE'RE GONNA LITTLE HOUSEKEEPING AT THIS POINT WE SORT OF A QUORUM MADAM SPEAKER. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FRAZIER AYE HERE FONG. AND WE ARE CURRENT. BAKER. BERMAN. CHIU. DALY NEAR FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. WHERE? HARPER. MATHIS. DOES IT MEDINA RESIDENT. NAZARIAN. O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER ALTERNATE OBERNOLTE FOR YOUR PATIENCE ENJOYED CLOSE. BUT CERTAINLY. I'M SORRY THAT YOU THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL AS WELL. AND I'M OBVIOUSLY I MEAN I CAN SEE BOTH SIDES OF IT. AND. WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON IT BEFORE. JUST TO SEE WHAT MORE IF WE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL IMPACTS ON THIS PROPOSAL. BUT. YOU STRUGGLE WITH THE RETARDED STATIONS I'VE STRUGGLE WITH OF THE DISABILITY DISABLED PARKING. I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I'M IN A RESERVE MY RIGHT TO. HOA WITHHOLD MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR. I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE PARTIES AS THE BILL MOVES MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. MEDINA GIVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR I DO AND AND I'M SORRY IF. YOU PRIORITY ANSWERS BUT I CAME IN LATE IS IT OFFERS THEM THAT I HAVE. WELL. AS PARKING OR JUST DROPPING OFF OR IT IS PARKING ALTHOUGH IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO BE ONLY PARKING THAT INVOLVES THE LOADING AND OFFLOADING. OF SOMEONE WITH A WHEELCHAIR THAT USES A LEFT WHERE HE RAN. SO IT IS VERY NARROWLY TAILORED TO THOSE USES. SO THE THE THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T STAY THERE ONCE THE THE PERSON IS HONOR OFF. WELL I I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON TO THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE THE EXEMPTION THAT REQUIRES IT TO ONLY BE LOADING AND OFFLOADING SO IF THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE VEHICLE WAS SOMEONE. IN A WHEELCHAIR THE WHO DRIVES THAT THE VEHICLE AND THEN USES A LIFT TO OFFLOAD CLEAR THEIR WHEELCHAIR OBVIOUSLY. THE VEHICLE WOULD STAY THERE WELL THEY DID WHATEVER THEY NEED TO DO THANK YOU. BACK. WELL FIRST BY BAKER SECOND BY MATHIS. ALWAYS LIKED CLOSE UP I'D JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS DRIVE OF. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE A. AS YOU KNOW ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE JUST ABLE COMMUNITY IS A TRUE PASSION OF MINE. HOWEVER WELL WELL WELL INTENDED I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS PREMATURE. S. MIGHT LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES REVIEW OWNERS. TO CHARGE OUR VEHICLES AND UNFORTUNATELY TREAT SEGMENTS OF THE DISABLED DISABLED COMMUNITY DIFFERENTLY. EVERY DISABLED PERSON MUST HAVE ACCESS TO PARKING AND I DO NOT THINK THIS BILL RESULTS IN THAT PERFECT APPROACH. HOWEVER I PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. WITH THE RIGHT TO RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR AND URGE YOU TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY. MANIFEST INTO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS AND DOESN'T SEGMENT THE DISABLED POPULATION. AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF PARKING ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL SEGMENTS SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOU WORKING WITH THE. THE COMMUNITY AND. AND HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH. A SOLUTION THAT WORKS TIME CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO THAT ALSO. WITH THAT MANSARD A PLEASE KALRA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS FRAZIER. AYE FRAZIER IPHONE.

I GUESS I'LL DO MY CLOSING. OF. SO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I UNDERSTAND THE BILL'S ABOUT PROPER NOTIFICATION TO VIOLATORS AND NOT ABOUT AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT HOTLINES. I WILL SUPPORT I WILL BE SPORTING A BILLS BECAUSE DRIVERS DESERVE TO BE PROPERLY NOTIFIED IF THEY'RE BEING TICKETED. HOWEVER I THINK THERE MAY BE. STILL SOME ISSUES TO. BE RESOLVED. AROUND AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES AND I HOPE ARE RESULT BEFORE YOU THIS IS PUT INTO PRACTICE. LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER. SOLUTION FOR HOTLINES. THERE SO VALUABLE IN A LOT OF THE REGIONS AND ALSO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BOND THAT. AND SO LOOKING FORWARD TO. HELPING THEM WITH THAT. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WHEN YOU'RE READY. PLEASE PROCEED. WE CARE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FOUR. IS JUST A. A SIMPLE CLEAN UP TO LAST YEAR'S AB FIVE ALL THREE. WHICH ESTABLISHED THE PAPER PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME DRIVERS WHO ACQUIRE PARKING TICKETS. AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY FOUR MAKE CLEAR THE INTENT OF AB FIVE A THREE. WHICH IS TO MAKE PARKING TICKETS ISSUED TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. ELIGIBLE FOR THE PARKING TICKET PROGRAM CREATED IN AB FIVE ALL THREE EVEN IF THEY WERE ISSUED. THOSE CITATIONS PRIOR TO THE JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COMPLIANCE STATE. THIS WAS ALWAYS. THE INTENT OF AB FIVE OF THREE WHICH IS TO RECEIVE. ZERO WHICH RECEIVED ZERO NO VOTES AND. THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WITH ME TODAY IS MY CAROL FROM THE WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL AGAIN WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. YES I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THIS BILL LAST YEAR WAS TO CREATE A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF THEIR PARKING TICKETS. BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR CAR REGISTERED BE LEGAL ON THE STREET ALL THINGS WE AGREE THAT WE WANT TO HAVE DONE. WHEN THE BILL WENT THROUGH WE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL PARKING TICKETS. AS WE STARTED TO GO THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A COUPLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOLD US THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE HAVE A TICKET IN ADVANCE OF JULY ONE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW PROVISIONS OF LAW. AND THIS SEEMED ON NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD NEGOTIATED FOR AND FURTHERMORE NOT GOOD POLICY IN THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE POPULATION WOULD HAVE NO REMEDY AT ALL. THE BACK UNDER THE OLD LAW SO WE THINK THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE. CONSISTENT FIX OF WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR WE ARE TONIGHT VOTE. SECOND. THE FIRST IN A SECOND. FOR SOON MR MEDINA SEX RIGHT HERE CURRY. MISTER LIKE YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE. PUBLIC THAT YOU WOULDN'T THINK HAVE TESTIFIED SPREE BILL. HE MOVES THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENT PLEASE MY INGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICE DOOR VOICE OUR OPINION. WE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT SIR PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITY SACRAMENTO. ARE WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL. THESE ARE ALL DULY ISSUED CITATIONS THAT PEOPLE BUT NOBODY FOR SOMEBODY TO GET A PARKING TICKET YOU HAVE TO MAKE A VIOLATION OF LAW. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TICKETS THAT WE HAVE FILED WITH THE DMV FOR COLLECTION WE PAID THREE DOLLARS OF CITY MONEY. FOR THAT TICKET TO BE PUT ON THE THAT DMT COLLECTION OF DOCKET. IF THIS BILL PASSES WE WOULD HAVE TO A REFILE THE VAST MAJORITY THOSE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND CITATIONS FOR COLLECTION. OF WE WE THINK IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND COST A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE ASK FOR NO VOTE. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKES TESTIFYING OPPOSITION OVER SHOW THEIR OPINION ON THE OFFICE BILL SEEING NONE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE OTHER MISTER O'DONNELL. JUST THANK YOU ARE IN MY COMMENTS MAYBE ALONG THE LINES OF. THE CITY SACRAMENTO THERE I ACTUALLY FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FOR THE CITY LONG BEACH IS LAST YEAR THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING. MAY LAST YEAR AND SOME AGO SHE ASIANS WITH EIGHTY FIVE A THREE. THAT HAD THE BILL ONLY REQUIRING. TO TICKETS TICKETS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE MEETINGS HELD CONVERSATIONS HAD AND THAT UNDERSTANDING FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE CITY LONG BEACH. WAS ESTABLISHED. DO YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON THE. THAT'S CLEARLY A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THAT WAS THE IMPRESSION THAT WAS. RECEIVED IT WAS NOT THE INTENT BUT THAT'S HOW THE BILL WAS WRITTEN. SO. I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE THAT THE CITY LONG BEACH WILL DOES HAVE SOME. SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THIS NEW APPROACH. WE WHERE. WE WOULD TO TEST THIS IS NOT A NEW APPROACH THAT THIS WAS THE INTENT ALTHOUGH FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THAT ACTUALLY. NOT AND WHERE ARE YOU WHERE BONE THAT'S THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AGREED THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BACK HERE TO MAKE YOU WANT TO CHANGE. PRIOR TO CLEAN WE JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ITS NOT CHANGE. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. BLOOM OF. IT WAS YOUR THIRD ENFORCEMENT. MOST MATHIS HAVE QUESTIONS OF HEALTH. I USED. THEN M. MADE INTERESTED IN HIS OPPOSITION FROM THE CITY. OKAY BECAUSE I'VE SEEN BEFORE OUR CITIES WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WAYS. COMPANIES THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH TO DO THE TICKETS. SO I AND MY MY THOUGHT IT HOW COME THEY'RE NOT RENEGOTIATING THE CONTRACTS WITH THESE AGENCIES THAT THEY HIRE. DO THEM I'M IN THE THE BILL CLEARLY IS JUST. SIMPLIFICATION TO GO BACK AND. I JUST WHAT WAS ALREADY DONE TO CLARIFY. SO FOR ME IT KIND OF COMMON SENSE THAT IF YOU GOT A CONTRACT. IT'S DOINGTHAT THE PARKING TICKETS OR ANY OF THE TICKETS. ITS THE I MEAN. QUIETLY QUESTION FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION. BUT NOW I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT THINGS AND I'VE SEEN THINGS HAPPEN WITH WITH SOME OF MY CITIES WHERE THEY'VE HAD. ISSUES WITH ONE FIRM IN THAT IT SWITCHING OVER TO ANOTHER FIRM THAN PEOPLE GETTING TICKETS TWICE AND THREE TIMES A. RIGHT IT'S IT'S A MASSIVE SELL. MANY CITIES DO CONTRACT BUT SACRAMENTO DOES IT ITSELF SO WE DO IT INTERNALLY SO THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE. SIMILAR DAY CHARGING YOURSELF THREE DOLLARS WE'RE PAYING THE DMV THREE DOLLARS TO PROCESS OUR OWN PARKING TICKETS WE WOULD LIKE TO GET PAID AND THE ONLY POINT WE CAN GET THESE FOLKS THAT. HAVE THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S A VIOLATION THAT BIG THEY EARNED A PARKING TICKET OR TWO. OF THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET IT COLLECTED IS AT THAT STOP POINTING DMB WHEN THEY HAVE TO GO REGISTER THEIR VEHICLE. SO WE'VE HAD IT EASY PAYMENT PLAN FOR YEARS. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT ASPECT OF FIVE WITH YOU FROM LAST YEAR BUT THIS IS RETROACTIVE IT'S NOT IT WAS NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WOULD BE RETROACTIVE TO. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND CITATIONS THAT WE'RE NOW IN JEOPARDY FOR US. IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT GUYS ZERO CORRECT I OWN I'M SURE THE AUTHOR WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND WORK THAT OUT. THANK YOU MISTER DOLE YOU HAVE YOUR EX ONE ASK QUESTION UP FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM THE CITY SACRAMENTO. SO WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS THE SAME AS THE CITY LONG BEACH IS PRESENT CORRECT. VERY LARGE IT HAS TO THE GOING BACK. YES NO WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS GROUP WE WE HAVE ALWAYS TICKETS THAT WE'VE ALREADY FILED WITH THE DMV TO COLLECT. SO WE PAY THE THREE DOLLARS THAT'S SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WE PAID APPROXIMATELY. WOULD WE IF THIS BILL PASSES WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK AND RE FILE THEM IN THE DIEM KEEP THE FEE FOR FOUGHT FOR COLLECTING PARKING TICKETS INCIDENTALLY WENT UP BY A DOLLAR. SO IT COST US FOUR DOLLARS TO COLLECT THE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TICKETS THAT WE ARE DO WE OWED SO WE PAY SEVEN DOLLARS. TO TRY TO GET THE SIX CLICK. SO FOR US IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT COSTS WERE. YOU KNOW VERY SURPRISED AT THAT. DISPLAY OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES OR DOES NOT DO BUSINESS CLEARLY WHICH WE SHARED ONE BEACHES UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE BILL. FROM FROM LAST YEAR GETS PER THANK YOU. THIS BAKER. Q. AND. I WONDER IF FOR. JUST TO BE TODAY THE OP I'M SORRY YOU JUST LEFT I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. YOU'LL EXERCISE TODAY. WE'RE YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOU INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WAS THAT CONDUCTED THROUGH YES I WAS. AGAIN AND AGAIN MAINLY WHAT THE STAFF THE CITY'S LIKE RUN ON THE LOBBYIST BUT. STAFF THE CITY SACRAMENTO THE PARKING A A PERSON WAS INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS FRIENDLY NOT FOR THE LEAGUE. NO. AND WHAT PROVISIONS SPECIFICALLY DO YOU FEEL MAKES IT WHERE THIS WASN'T THE CASE LAST YEAR AND THIS IS A CLARIFYING WHEN LOOKING AT THE BILL IT LOOKS CLARIFYING TO ME WELL IT'S. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE NEEDS THIS BILL. TO MAKE IT CLEARLY RETROACTIVE AND WE CAN THINK LAST YEAR STILL WHAT I'M ASKING A DIFFERENT QUESTION IT WILL WHEREIN THE BILL DO YOU THINK THIS ISN'T ALREADY COVERED BY LAST YEAR THAT IS A CLARIFYING. DO YOU HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU WHERE. I DON'T HAVE A RIGHT FOR TO BE BUT I KNOW THAT THE ONE IF THERE'S VERY FEW CHANGES IN THE BILL SO IT IT'S ONLY THE CHANGES THAT SAYS. YOU KNOW LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS. WELL I I GUESS I I WOULD I WOULD DISAGREE I'M JUST LOOKING AT PAGE TWO. THAT THE AMENDMENTS AND AREA IT DOES LOOK LIKE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO MYSELF BUT IT ABBY WELCOME. YOU KNOW I I HOPE THIS WILL GET OUT TODAY WE WELCOME TO HAVE US ESTABLISH WHERE IT'S NOT STRICTLY CLARIFYING IF YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE UKRAINIAN AND TRISTATE GROUNDED IN WHAT THAT LANGUAGES. THANK YOU. HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. MR LIKE YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY. THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL. YES CERTAINLY IF THERE IS A FEW AND ADDITIONAL FEE I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT WOULDN'T BE IMPOSED UPON. THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE FEE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF PAYING THEIR. WHAT THEY WHAT THEY NEED TO PAY WHAT WHAT WE'RE WHAT IS JUST A REASONABLE PAYMENT PLAN? AND. THIS IS NOT AMNESTY THIS IS JUST TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO NOT LOSE THEIR VEHICLES. BECAUSE THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION DOESN'T FOR THEM TO DO THAT ALL WENT PAYMENT. AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WAS ALWAYS THE INTENT. AND WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER LIKE IF BRING THIS BILL TO OUR COMMITTEE.

IF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY OR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CELLS PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE WELCOME TO THE PODIUM I'M TO THE DICE. SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT HERE. THE WAY TO GET STARTED. GOOD AFTERNOON JONES. TODAY'S HEARING IS AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO PREVIEW TO REVIEW THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES TWENTY EIGHTEEN. CRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. THE AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE PLAN EVERY TWO YEARS. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE PLEA THE PLAN IS TO INCLUDE AN UPDATED SCHEDULE AND COST ESTIMATE. UPDATE FINANCIAL SCENARIOS AND DISCUSSION OF ALL REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS. AUTHORITY HAS A DIFFICULT TASK IN DELIVERING HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. THEY MUST. BUILDING OPERATE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM UNDER VERY SPECIFIC DESIGN RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH. IN THE BOND MEASURE. AND THAT'S INCLUDING OPERATING WITHOUT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. BILL THE INITIAL SEGMENT WITHIN VERY TIGHT PARAMETERS REQUIRED FOR THE USE OF FEDERAL DOLLARS. COMPLETE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND ACQUIRE PROPERTY WITHIN A VERY LITIGIOUS ATMOSPHERE. AND. CLEAR SOME VERY REAL VERY INTIMIDATING ENGINEERING CHALLENGES. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE A. TO PROVIDE NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS TO HELP BUILD THE SYSTEM. NOW AT THAT TIME THE ESTIMATE FOR THE FULL COST OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WAS FORTY FIVE BILLION. SINCE THAT TIME THE COST OF FLUCTUATED BETWEEN HIGH OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED BILLION DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO. AND DOWN TO SIXTY FOUR BILLION AND NOW THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATE OF SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION IN THIS DRAFT PLAN. GOVERNOR BROWN HAS THROWN HIS FULL SUPPORT BY THE PROJECT. COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD. MEMBERS. AS THE FUNDING PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT WE THE LEGISLATURE SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MONUMENTAL EFFORT. AND MEMBERS LET'S BE VERY FRANK. THE PROJECT IS AT A CROSSROADS. TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM THE AUTHORITY OF OTHERS AND AND OUR OTHER PANELISTS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE INITIAL. OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE WAYS DOES THE I. U. S.. THIS IS TO GET HIGH SPEED TRAINS UP AND RUNNING. THIS SHOULD BE OUR MAIN FOCUS. AND AGAIN WE ARE THE FUNDING PARTNERS IN THIS PROJECT. AS SUCH WE MUST PROVIDE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT ANY PART OF THE DECISION MAKING. ABOUT ITS FUTURE. TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT TWO THINGS. TAKING A LOOK AT THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT AND TO FULLY DISCUSS WHAT WILL BE EXPECTED FROM US THE LEGISLATURE. IF THE PROJECT IS TO PROCEED. MEMBERS LAST TIME THIS COMMITTEE HEARD FROM THE AUTHORITIES WHEN WE REVIEWED THE DRAFT TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN SIGNALED A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. THE PLANTS WHICH THE IOWA AS THE INITIAL OPERATING SYSTEM FROM SOUTH. TWO NORTH. DO CAN EXAMINE IS A DOUCHE AFTER IN NORTH NORTHERN KERN COUNTY. THE PLAN ALSO LAID OUT A MORE REALISTIC FUNDING SCHEME ALTHOUGH. THERE WERE MANY. RISKS INVOLVED. AND A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN. CONSTRUCTION CENTRAL VALLEY CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD. MAJOR STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BY MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED CRAFTS. CRAFTSMAN IN THAT PROCESS. I HAVE BEEN TO THE VALLEY TO SEE THE PROJECT AND IS VERY IMPRESSIVE. IT ALSO HAS IT ALSO HAS MADE AN UNDENIABLE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY. RIGHT NOW IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE AUTHORITY SUCCESSFULLY MET THE DEADLINES FOR FEDERAL RECOVERY ACT FUNDS. AND BEGAN SPENDING THE PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT BOND FUNDS I'M CONSTRUCTION. TO BOOK IN PROJECTS CALTRAIN IN THE NORTH AND THE ROSECRANS. MARK. MARK MY QUIRK REAL. GREAT I ALWAYS CALL ROSECRANS GREAT SO SEPARATION IN THE SOUTH ARE MOVING FORWARD. THE AUTHORITY ITSELF HAS BEEN THROUGH SOME CHANGES. WITH FORMER CAST A. SECRETARY BRIAN KELLY REPLACING. FORMER DIRECTOR. CHAU JUST MORALES. AND BRINGING IN NEW MANAGEMENT STAFF WITH EXPERIENCE BOTH IN OVERSEEING LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. AND COMPLEX. ORGANIZATIONS. AND MOSTLY IMPORTANT. THE AUTHORITY UNDER TOOK A COMPREHENSIVE COST REVIEW FOR ONGOING CONSTRUCTION. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS REVIEW PREVENT PRODUCE WHAT THEY CALL A TRUE COST TO COMPLETE. NUMBER FOR THE EXISTING CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES. WITH COUPLE CAVIAR. AND THE AUTHORITY ANNOUNCED A TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE OF SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. WELL THIS IS TROUBLING TO HEAR IT IS WHAT IT IS. AND NECESSARY TO ACT TO BE ACCURATE AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD. THESE NEW COST ESTIMATES OR INCLUDED AND IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN CONTINUES THE COMMITMENT TO A NORTHERN IOS OR SILICON VALLEY TO CENTRAL VALLEY LINE. WHICH IS EXTENDED. SO THAT IT STARTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ENDS IN BAKERSFIELD BAKERSFIELD. THE COST OF THE IOS IS ESTIMATED TO BE TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS INCLUDES THE CURRENT TEN POINT SIX BILLION FOR THE ONGOING CENTRAL VALLEY CONSTRUCTION. THERE I WAS WOULD BE FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF PROP PROPOSITION ONE A BONDS. FEDERAL FUNDS CAP AND TRADE PAY AS YOU GO. AND CAP AND TRADE FINANCING. THIS IS THE SAME FUNDING SCHEME THAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. WHICH HINGES ON A SUCCESSFUL LONG TERM FINANCING OF FUTURE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. THE A F. ORDEAL OUTLINES THREE CRITICAL ELEMENTS TO MAKE THIS FINANCING WORK. THREE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE MUST DO. STAN CAP AND TRADE THROUGH. TWENTY FIFTY. PROVIDE A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF FUNDS EVERY YEAR TO THE AUTHORITY FROM CAP AND TRADE OR OTHER STATE FUNDS. ENSURE FUTURE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS FOR THE AUTHORITY. WILL WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED REDISTRIBUTED OR. IMPAIRED. NOT ANY OF THESE ARE EASY. FACT ALL WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND MAY REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE OPTIONS IN IMPLICA IMPLICATIONS. OF OF INACTION. MEMBERS. WE HAVE TO GO INTO THIS WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN. WE CONTINUE. TO EVALUATE. WELL PREVIOUS BUSINESS PLANS HAVE PROVIDED SOME UPDATE TO THE VISION OF HEIS HOW HIGH SPEED RAIL COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. WE'RE APPROACHING A POINT WHERE. WE DECIDE TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES AND COMMITMENTS NECESSARY TO SEE THIS THROUGH. OR WE COME UP. WITH ALTERNATIVES. THIS BUSINESS PLAN LAYS OUT THE NEEDS AND RISKS OF MOVING FORWARD. AND WE NEED TO REALLY CONSIDER BOTH IN THE SYRIAN AND APPRECIATE MISTER KELLY'S. PULLING THE BANDAID OFF ON THIS BUSINESS PLAN. THIS IS REAL. THIS NO SMOKING MIRRORS INVOLVED IN THIS ONE. WE WILL HEAR TODAY FROM BRIAN KELLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WE'VE ASKED CEO KILLER TO BRIBE PROVIDE US A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS PLAN. AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR STAFF WITH HIM TODAY. THE CAN HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE. WE'VE ALSO ASK HIM. TO THEN WALK US THROUGH CLEARLY IN DIRECT THE FINANCIAL PLAN FOR THE SYSTEM. WE WILL THEN HEAR FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE THEIR CAP AND TRADE EXPERT. HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP. WHOSE WORK WE SHALL SHOULD ALL BE GRATEFUL FOR. THESE PRIVATE CITIZENS ARE PUTTING THEIR YEARS OF EXPERTISE INTO HELPING US GOVERN THIS MONUMENTAL PROJECT. AND WE OWE THEM A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I'M BRIAN KELLY SEE OVER THE. CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY. PLEASE BE HERE TODAY AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. ON MARCH NINTH THE AUTHORITY RELEASED THIS PLAN UP FOR PUBLIC REVIEW. AND COMMENTED DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN A PLAN. PREVENTS OUR SITE PRESENTS PRESENTS A VISION FOR IMPLEMENTING. THE NATION'S FIRST HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES. THAT PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY HAVE FACED AND SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS DRAFT PLAN THE AUTHORITIES ASSIGNING COSTS. TO THE RISKS PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IN PRIOR PLANTS. AND REPORTS AND PRESENT A BASELINE COST ESTIMATE. FOR ALL PROJECTS SECTIONS. ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT PLANNED DISCONTINUES THE PAST PRACTICE OF ESTIMATING PROJECT COSTS WITH THE SPECIFIC DOLLAR ESTIMATE. INSTEAD THE PLAN ESTIMATES COST UTILIZING A BASELINE ESTIMATE AND RANGES. CONSISTENT WITH BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR MEGA PROJECTS. THE REVISED BASELINE COST ESTIMATES SHOWN INCREASING COSTS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION. INCREASED CONTINGENCY IN PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED CONSTRUCTION DELAYS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THESE AREAS MAKE UP ABOUT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF THE COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED. WITH THE FULL PHASE ONE SYSTEM BILL THEM. THE SCHEDULE FOR THE VALUE VALLEY SERVICE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD IN THE FOR FACE ONE SERVICE. FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM. OR PUSHED OUT BY FOUR YEARS RESPECTIVELY. SCHEDULED TO BE AFFECTED PRIMARILY BY THE TIMING AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING. FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. THE DRAFT PLAN ALSO OUTLINES A FINANCING STRATEGY CONSISTENT WITH THE ONE OUTLINED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. TO BETTER ALIGN THE TIMING IN AVAILABILITY OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. SO THE PROJECT CAN BE DELIVERED IN A MANNER THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME. IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES THE DRAFT PLAN PROPOSES TO CONTINUE. A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY THAT BUILDS INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WILL BE LINKED OVER TIME TO PROVIDE MOBILITY ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THE CALIFORNIANS. AND INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IS SOON AS POSSIBLE. TOWARD THAT END. THE DROUGHT BUSINESS PLAN IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT PRIORITIES IAN ARE CONSTRAINED FUNDING SCENARIO. FIRST WE MEET OUR COMMITMENTS TO OUR FEDERAL FEDERAL FUNDING PARTNER. IF WE WILL COMPLETE THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. INCOMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS FOR A THE ENTIRE PHASE ONE SYSTEM. BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS REQUIRED IN OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT. SECOND WE EXTEND THE VALUE VALLEY SERVICE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD. THE DRUG USINESS PLAN RECOGNIZES THE HIGH RIDERSHIP AND REVENUE POTENTIAL. OF LEAKING THIS LEAK LINKING THE SILICON VALLEY BUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO. ALL THE WAY TO BAKERSFIELD. THE PROPOSAL WOULD DELIVER TO DO TWENTY FOUR MILES OF HIGH SPEED RAIL READY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR USE BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THE PLAN PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT HIGH SPEED RAIL. ALREADY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND MADERA. IN THE SILICON VALLEY BETWEEN GILROY AND SAN FRANCISCO. TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES FOR EXISTING PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEMS. EXPAND CLEAN ELECTRIFIED SERVICE. AND PREPARE THE CORRIDORS FOR TESTING IN POTENTIAL EARLY HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATIONS. FOURTH WE ISOLATE THE TUNNELING IN THE POTATO PASSES THE FINAL MISSING LINK TO COMPLETE THE BALLOT ABOUT A SERVICE. WE ENGAGE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERTISE TO EXAMINE AND REFINED DESIGN OPTIONS. OPTIMIZE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY LIMIT COSTS AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE FUNDING INNOVATIVE FUNDING OPTIONS FOR THAT SEGMENT OF THE PROJECT. AND FIVE WE CONTINUE THE BOOK AND INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVING LOS ANGELES UNION STATION. THE BURBANK ANAHEIM CORRIDOR AND THE ELECTED ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN COURT OR IN THE BAY AREA. THE PLAN IN SOME REFLECTS THE AUTHORITIES COMMITMENT TO APPLY LESSONS LEARNED AND TO MAKE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY. TO DELIVER THIS PROJECT TO INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SOON AS POSSIBLE WHILE COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND MAKING IMPORTANT VESTMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ASSISTANT WITH ACTION TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO INVEST WHAT OCCULT BOOK AND FUNDS FROM PART PROPOSITION ONE A. WITH THE RELEASE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN WE'VE INITIATED A SIXTY DAY. A PERIOD OF PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT IT CLOSES ON MAY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE FINAL PLAN IS SCHEDULED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITY BOARD AT ITS HEARING DURING THE THIRD WEEK OF MAY. TO MY RIGHT OR TWO. REPRESENTATIVES OF THAT OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM. ONE IS NEW TO THE AUTHORITY THAT'S A JOE HEDGES WHO IS OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WHO WE BROUGHT DOWN FROM SEATTLE WASHINGTON. AND TO HIS RIGHT MY FAR RIGHT IS RESPONDER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY. WITH THAT SUMMARY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OF MEMBERS OF AT THEIR AT THE. THE DIES DOWN FOOD LIKE TO CONTINUE WILL GO AND ASK QUESTIONS AT THE VERY END. YES POSTING ANYTHING INCLUDE ANY COMMENTS. YOUR PLAN. THOSE ARE MOSTLY HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WELL MOSTLY HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CANCER CHAIRMAN. SIR ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER FUNG. I THINK YOU OFFER FOR BEING HERE. HOW MUCH MONEY? CURRENTLY EXIST THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW. WHO A FEW CLUED? HANDICAP TRADE COMMITMENT FROM. THE SUCH A CAP AND TRADE LAST YEAR. WE DESCRIBED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN IN RANGES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG OF BECAUSE THE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES BUT VOLATILE SO LOYALISTS THAT STIPULATE THAT HOW MUCH MONEY IF YOU INCLUDE THAT. WE ESTIMATE. BETWEEN TWENTY. ON THE LOW END IN ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT BILLION ON THE HIGH END SO YET TWENTY TO TWENTY EIGHT BILLION CURRENTLY. CORRECT ENHANCE. AND YOU PROJECT IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. THAT THE POTENTIAL ESTIMATE IS SEVENTY SEVEN TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION. THE BASELINE PROCESS MEANT FOR THE ENTIRE PHASE ONE SYSTEM IS IS THAT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION THAT'S RIGHT SO THERE'S A THERE'S IT SO THERE'S A DELTA OF. FIFTY TWO AIR. SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PLUS OR MINUS. YEAH AS A RATIO OF. A SORT OF IDENTIFIED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT AND OF FUNDING WE HAVE IN HAND YEAH THAT'S IT WE HAVE ABOUT A THIRD. IS OPPOSED TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE. BOND MEASURE WAS FIRST PASSED THE BOND PROVIDED US ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE FUNDING WE NEED FOR THE PROJECT. OKAY. AND AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT THE DRUG BUSINESS PLAN YOU INDICATE THAT. THE POTATO PASSED TUNNELS IS THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN THE SILICON VALLEY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT. RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO CONSTRUCT A BECAUSE OF A QUOTE FUNDING SHORTFALL. WELL WHY DOES THE BUSINESSMEN PROPOSED A BILL TO ORPHAN SECTION TRACKS. IF THERE'S NO WAY TO CONNECT THEM. OF MR FUNG THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT ONE THE AUTHORITY HAS HAD FOR SOMETIME A PRINCIPLE OF. MAKING STRATEGIC CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COURT OR THE CAN BE LINKED TOGETHER OVER. AND ALSO. THAT AS A STRATEGY TO BRING A MOBILITY BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH TAXPAYER MONEY. IS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WE PROPOSE IN THIS PLAN IS TO MAKE THE SAME KIND OF INVESTMENTS ON THE SILICON VALLEY SIDE BY EXTENDING THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT ALL THE WAY TO GILROY. SO WE'VE ELECTRIFIED TRAIN SERVICE FROM GILROY TO SAN FRANCISCO THAT BOTH CALTRAIN CAN YOU CALTRAIN CAN USE IN THE SHORT TERM. AND REDUCE THEIR DIESEL. TRAIN OPERATIONS BETWEEN KID A GILROY IN SAN JOSE WOULD ALSO BE A A A A A CORRIDOR THAT THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO USE. A WITH EXPRESS TRAIN SOONER THAN TWENTY TWENTY NINE PERHAPS ASSUMES TWENTY TWENTY SIX OR TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SIMILARLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY UNDER FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT. AFTER WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE REQUIRED INTO THAT AGREEMENT. TO FIND OPERATIONAL INTERIM USE FOR THE. STRUCTURES THAT WE BUILD. AND SO ON THAT SIDE WE ARE PROPOSING TO EITHER A T. PUT THOSE STRUCTURES TO USE THROUGH EITHER EARLY ELECTRIFICATION. COMBINING THAT WITH THE AMTRAK SERVICE IS NOW AVAILABLE THE WAY TO BAKERSFIELD FROM SACRAMENTO WHERE THE BAY AREA. REDUCING THAT TRAVEL TIME PROVIDING ENOUGH. USER BENEFIT IN THE INTERIM. WHILE WE MOVE FOR THE BALLOT VALLEY SECTION IN ESSENCE. THE GAP OR FUNDING SHORTFALL WE HAVE IS ABOUT THE PRICE OF THE TOP. AND SO WHAT WE. PROPOSED TO DO HERE IS MAKE IN ROME A USE AND INVESTMENTS ON EACH SIDE OF THAT ISOLATE THE TUNNEL IS THE ISSUE. ENGAGE WITH THE. INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND OTHERS ON WHAT THE TUNNEL COULD IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE IMPROVE PURSUE OPTIONS FOR FUNDING OF THE TUNNEL. AND THEN GET THE TIME A BILL SO WHAT IS THE PRICE OF THE TITLE. IT'S ESTIMATED A IT'S IT'S AN EARLY A DESIGN RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. SO IT'S SO KIND OF A WIDE RANGE BECAUSE IT'S ESTIMATED BETWEEN AND THE LOW END OF FIVE ON THE HIGH END ABOUT TWELVE BILLION. AND. CURRENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ANY. FEDERAL STATE AND PRIVATE FUNDING FOR THAT THAT GAP. A NOT FOR THE GAP. OKAY AND THEN. I IN TERMS OF. OTHER THAN THE IN SORRY IT MAY BE USEFUL TO SAY AGAIN BECAUSE. WHAT WE HAVE IS THE CHAIRMAN NOTED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS? THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND RISK IN BOTH OUR COSTS AND OUR FUNDING AND ON THE FUNDING SIDE. DEPENDING WHAT CAP AND TRADE COMES IN THERE'S A SCENARIO OUTLINED IN THE PLAN. WERE OF CAP AND TRADE COMES IN THAT THE HIGH END OUR COSTS WITH THE LOW AND. WE HAVE NO GAP THAT'S PROBABLY UNLIKELY SUI ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIVE. TO TEN BILLION OF WHITE. WELL I THINK THE UNCERTAINTY IS. RIGHT OKAY THAT'S THE IMMEDIATE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THIS WHOLE PROJECT IS EXPECTING WHAT GIVES US AS MEMBERS PAUSE IN TERMS OF OF OF. OF THIS WHOLE ENTIRE PROJECT. SO I AND ED I HEARD ON IN AN ARTICLE THAT WAS MENTIONED THAT IT. WOULD POTENTIAL YOU WOULD WE WOULD YOU WOULD ASK OR I'D RATHER IT WOULD ASK FOR. A VOTE FOR FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO HOW MUCH IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN I PATHETICALLY HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU ASK. IF THE DELTA IS. FIFTY TO SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION YEAH I'M NOT SURE. WHAT? A I THINK WAS A RECORD I THINK THIS RICHER'S. MENTION WHO AND RESPONSIBILITY HARSH INFERNO OPENED UP THE ANSWER THOUGH. YOU KNOW WE ADDITIONAL FUND WE EVEN HAD A DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOT THAT'S THE THE RIGHT PURSUIT THE PURSUIT TO WE LAY OUT IN THE PLAN IS UTILIZING THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE. TO MAKE YOU KNOW INTERIM INVESTMENTS NOW THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS NOW ON EACH SIDE OF THE TUNNEL AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK COMPLETE THE DESIGN WORK. AND PURSUE FUNDING FOR THE TUNNEL ELEMENT LATER AS WELL AS FOR ELEMENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFTER WE COMPLETE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. SO YOU KNOW BEYOND THAT I DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO GO TO THE VOTERS FOR ANY SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND I ENTERED TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF IF IT BOTHERS A TIME FRAME THAT HAS TO BE COMPLETED FOR THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BE UTILIZED OR THEY HAVE TO BE REFUNDED BACK TO THE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT CORRECT WE'VE RECEIVED THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS WE'VE ALREADY SPENT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OF US. THE REMAINING NINE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IS IN THE FISCAL YEAR TEN APPROPRIATION THAT WE HAVE NOT ACCESSED YET. AND WILL USE AT A LATER TIME. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. PART OR YOU KNOW THE WAY SHUT DOWN THE PROJECT WE WOULD BE SUBJECT OF REPAYMENT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS WE PARTY SPENT. SO HOW MUCH OF THE FUNDS SO YOU HAVE TO THE TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY BILLION YOU CURRENTLY HAVE SO WHAT IS IT GOING TO BE USED FOR RIGHT NOW. BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR YEAH WE WOULD UTILIZE THOSE GUYS THAT SUGGESTED EARLIER FOR. A COUPLE OF THINGS. BUT ONE WE PROPOSE IN THIS PLAN TO SPEND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH THE COLD BOOK AND INVESTMENTS. THE CHAIRMAN NOTED AGAIN GREAT SEPARATION THAT AREA CALLED ROSECRANS MARXUACH THAT IS. AT ONETIME WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS THAT RAILROAD THAT TRAFFIC CROSSING IN THE STATE. SO WE ARE FUNDING PARTNERS FOR SEVENTY SIX MILLION ON THAT THE REMAINING FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION WE WOULD USE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AND AN EXPANSION OF THE LA UNION STATION. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE WOULD USE IT TO COMPLETE OUR WORK FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH THAT WE ARE NOW IN CONSTRUCTION ON. WHO WOULD EXPAND THATINDIVIDUAL SPILLED MAKING THAT STRETCH APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED FORTY MILES AND GET THAT TO BE A HIGH SPEED RAIL ELECTRIFIED READY? INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE WOULD INVEST TO EXPAND OF THE ELECTRIFICATION OF CALTRAIN ON THE PENINSULA SIDE ALL THE WAY TO GILROY. WHICH ULTIMATELY WE ALSO WOULD WE NEED TO BE ELECTRIFIED GET IN THE BAY AREA. AND WE WOULD. PURSUE. FURTHER ALL ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ON A WHOLE SEGMENT OF THE PROJECTS WOULD BE PLEADED. AND WE WOULD. PURSUE. FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS LEADING TO THE TUNNEL SECTION ON BOTH THE EAST AND WEST SIDE. OF THE. OF THE VALUE VALLEY SERVICE OF THE CRITICAL PASSED. NOW IN TERMS OF YOU GIVEN. A PRETTY WIDE RANGE IN TERMS OF YOUR HIGH AND ANNUAL AT THE LOW END AS. SO YOU'VE SEVEN SEVEN BILLION TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION HOW RELIABLE ARE THOSE NUMBERS SINCE WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME THOSE NUMBERS HAVE CONTINUALLY CHANGING. YOU KNOW PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL. AT THE AUTHORITY. THE THE BOARD HAD INITIATED ACOSTA COMPLETE EXERCISE IN EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU WOULD WHICH WE CALL THE BASELINE ESTIMATE. IS THE RESULT OF THAT EXERCISE THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE TEN POINT SIX BILLION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT'S WE GET THE TWENTY NINE POINT FIVE FOR THE BALLOT ABOUT SERVICE AND THE SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION FOR THE STATEWIDE. A SERVICE SO THAT'S THE BASELINE WHICH IS I'VE DONE ON AN ESTIMATE OF ALIGNMENTS WE WOULD USE. CHEERIOS YOU NEED. INSIDE OF A TRIP THAT SEEMS TO FULLY FUNDING AT THE GAP THAT IT AT THE PERSON TIRE SYSTEM AT SEVENTY SEVEN BE THE WHOLE. ANAHEIM TO SAN FRANCISCO SERVICE PHASE ONE. SO THAT'S THE BASELINE. WHAT WE ARE DOING DIFFERENTLY IN THIS PLANS BEFORE IS NOT DONE IN THE PAST? IS A YOU KNOW I'M I'M UNCOMFORTABLE COMING HERE. FOR PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND WE DON'T HAVE. ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE WE DON'T HAVE FOR THE DESIGN WORK DONE TO JUST LEAVE IT AT A SIMPLE DOLLAR ESTIMATE. SO WHAT I'VE INCLUDED HERE IS A UTILIZING AYE AYE WHAT I WOULD CALL BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICE TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF AROUND THAT BASELINE. IF WE MANAGE WELL. GOING FORWARD WE CAN COME IN BELOW THAT SEVENTY SEVEN WE HAVE A LOW RANGE. THREE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE ESTIMATE FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. AND A HIGH OF NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS. GENERALLY THE SWING UNDER INDUSTRY PRACTICE AT THIS LEVEL OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT IS TWENTY PERCENT BELOW THIRTY PERCENT ABOVE. WHERE WE KNOW MORE LIKE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SWING IS LOWER BECAUSE FIVE PERCENT BELOW FIFTY PERCENT ABOVE? SO WE USED THE BASELINE TO LAY OUT OUR BEST ESTIMATE AND THEN REPLIED INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES ON WHAT THOSE SWINGS COULD. AND IF I'M CORRECT THIS ALREADY HAS MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS IN UNSPENT CAP AND TRADE REVENUES WHY HASN'T THE AUTHORITY SPENT. OR WHAT IS WHAT IS IT PLAYING TO DO WITH THAT BILLION DOLLARS IF THEY HAVEN'T SPENT IT ALREADY. WE HAVE SPENT SOME CAPITA RATE DOLLARS A AND NOT A HUGE AMOUNT BUT SOME IN THE AT CALTRAIN CORRIDOR FOR THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT. RUSSELL YEAH BICU RUSS FUNKY FINANCIAL OFFICER WE HAVE ABOUT A LITTLE OVER BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH FOR PROP ONE A AND ALSO LITTLE BILLION. BUT OVER BILLION DOLLARS FOR CAP AND TRADE OF THOSE ARE DEAF ON TARGETED FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAYING THAT WERE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY NOW. SO THOSE A BEACON FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT ALSO TO MAKE SURE WE MEET OUR OUR AGREEMENT WHICH IS A REQUIRES A FIFTY. BUT LOOK THE LAST FEW QUESTIONS AND YOU KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES CONTINUE ON. I THINK IN THE BUSINESS PLAN AS I READ IT. YOU PROPOSE FOR I GUESS FOR THE FIRST TIME OR MAYBE THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF PUBLICLY INDICATED THAT YOU WOULD. POTENTIALLY BORROW AGAINST THE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES. WOULDN'T AND THAT. BE USING A LOT OF THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS FOR DEBT SERVICE. YELLOW ME UP START THIS AND RUSSELL HAVE YOU HIT A JUMP IN. THAT'S NOT A NEW IDEA IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. THE SCENARIO THAT WAS PRESENTED THAT PLANNED ASSUME TO FINANCING OF CAP AND TRADE AS WELL. WHAT WE DID IN THIS PLAN WAS A ARTICULATED WITH A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICITY WHAT WOULD BE? WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS RECOMMENDED THE KIND OF THINGS YOU NEED TO MAKE THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS UNANSWERABLE? USED TO BE A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNNY TO BE. INVESTMENT GRADE SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A FLOOR OF A COMMITMENT AN EXTENSION OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO TWENTY FIFTY. AND. ANON IMPAIRMENT OF LANGUAGES IDEAL. ALSO TO GET INVESTMENT GRADE RATING SO THOSE ARE SORT OF THREE THINGS THE INDUSTRY IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU NEED. TO GET THE HIGHEST INVESTMENT GRADE RATING FOR THE FINANCING BUT THE IDEA FINANCING CAP AND TRADE. IS REALLY HAS TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO. BRING DOLLARS FORWARD TO MEET OUR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS AT THE TIME THE KAPPA CONSTRUCTION USED TO BE BUILT. THAT DOING A MAKE A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE ON A PAGE YOU GO BASIS WOULD HAVE US CONSTRUCTING THIS THING ALL THE WAY OUT OF TWENTY FIFTY YEAR BEYOND. AND SO. THE FINANCING ELEMENT IS SIMPLY TO BRING DOLLARS FORD SEEING GET THE WORK DONE SOONER. I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS THAT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW OF ONE WORD AND WHEN DID IN THE DEBATE OF CAP AND TRADE THAT THERE WAS ANY JUSTIFICATION USE CAP AND TRADE TO PAY BOND DEBT AND SO IN. IN TERMS OF INVESTING CAPITAL DOLLARS I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS WERE ANTICIPATING THAT YOU WOULD FUND PROJECTS. ACTUAL DELIVERABLE PROJECTS SENSITIVE I USING IT TOOK THE FUN BONDS. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S CLEARLY A CONCERN THERE AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS YOU MAKE YOU'RE ASSUMING THOUGH THAT THE LEGISLATURE EXTENSIVE AND TRADE. POST TO TWENTY FIFTY WHICH IS AN OPEN QUESTION CURRENTLY RIGHT YEAH IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION ALTHOUGH AGAIN I WOULD SO SAFE FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE WE UTILIZE THE. ASSUMPTION FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN WHICH HAD CAP AND TRADE GOING OUT THAT FAR WE KNOW THAT IT WAS EXTENDED LAST YEAR WE DON'T NEED THE. EXTENSION OR THE. THE FINANCING IMMEDIATELY DONE SOMETHING WE NEED DIRECTLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE IN THE TIMELINE OF ROUGHLY. TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY THREE. ROUGHLY THAT TIMELINE. AND SO. THAT'S WHY WE'VE WE'VE LAID OUT IS AGAIN THIS WAS FIRST RAISED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS PLAN HERE WERE SAYING THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU NEED TO GET INVESTMENT GRADE. A RATING YOU KNOW I THINK I'D SAY FURTHER ABOUT FINANCING THE CAP AND TRADE REP. MONEY IS. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO DEDICATE MONEY TO THIS MAKE A PROJECT. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MANY OF THE SALES TAX COUNTY'S FROM AROUND THE STATE THAT DEDICATE SALES TAX MONEY TO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO BOND AGAINST THOSE REVENUES. IT'S AT A VERY COMMON FOR PROJECTS OF THIS SIZE AND SCOPE. SO THAT YOU CAN PULL THE CASH FOR DAY AGAIN BE ABLE TO MEET CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE PROJECT IN A TIMELY WAY BUT. BUT ESTIMATE AND THAT YOU WOULD BE USING SOME OF THE CAPITAL DOLLARS TO PAY DOWN DEBT AND INTEREST ON DEBT CORRECT THAT THREAT. SO. YOU I THINK THE PUBLIC ANYBODY TO KNOW THAT THAT MONEY IS BEING DIVERTED FROM ONE PROJECT PROTECT FOR WHAT ONE PROJECT TO PAY FOR IT FOR FOR DEBT SERVICE WHAT IT WOULD BE PAID A DEBT SERVICE TO PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT. THEN BUT I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF READING THAT. THE BUSINESS PLAN PROJECT IS A PLAN I MEAN THERE ARE OUT STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNFUNDED ASSETS. IT'S PROJECT CORRECT. I'M NOT SURE WHICH MEAN BY UNFUNDED ASSETS I'M SORRY GO THERE. IF ON PAGE FORTY ONE YOU YOU DO TERM TO TAKE A PASS AS UNFUNDED ASSET AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS. BEING PUT INTO THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING A LOT OF REVENUE THAT POTENTIALLY MAY NOT MATERIALIZE SO THERE IS A LOT OF STILL. GAPS IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN. THERE IS NO QUICKLY BOOK. THIS PROJECT FROM DAY ONE. HAS NEVER HAD ALL THE FUNDING IT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. AS I SAID AT THE OUTSET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THE VOTERS APPROVE THE BOND THAT PROVIDED ONE FIFTH OF THE MONEY FOR THE THE ENTIRE COMPLETED A PROJECT. BUT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF WHAT WE NEED FOR THE ENTIRE COMPLETION A PROJECT. THEREFORE OUR STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO INVEST THE DOLLARS THAT WE DO HAVE. TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC AS SOON AS WE CAN IN AN INCREMENTAL WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE IN THIS PLAN UNTIL. WE'VE WE IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT I WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON PRACTICE TO BUILD TRANSIT SYSTEMS. AROUND STATE YOU BUILD WHICH YOU HAVE WITH THE MONEY YOU HAVE IN ULTIMATELY YOU EXPAND OVER TIME WOULD MORE MONEY IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR EXPANSION. BUT I APPRECIATE THE CANDOR I JUST THINK THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW SEEING THIS BILL COMING FORWARD AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE. I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY TRULY UNDERSTAND THE TRUE GAP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AS A STATE AND THE LACK OF FUNDS THAT PERSON AT NECESSARY TO BUILD THIS PROJECT. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. HERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF QUESTIONS. OF THE. PALACE MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIRMAN OF CERTAINLY APPRECIATE I'M THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK GOT THIS MY SECOND MEETING. OF CHASTISED COMMITTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR CONVENING THIS SORT OF HAS BEEN ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE MEET YOU BROUGHT CLAYTON CERTAIN WELCOME YOUR OFFICE REACHING OUT TO ME PERSONALLY. AND YOU KNOW LETTING ME KNOW THE HISTORY THIS BEHIND THIS I THINK THAT AGAIN THE VOTERS OF. CALIFORNIANS VOTED TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FOR. SURLIS. THE GOVERNOR'S WISHES TO. MOVE THERE'S PROJECT FOR AND KNOW THIS PROJECT HAS HAD SOME SHORTFALLS BASE WHEN YOU JUST. AS YOU DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL SHORTFALL THAT EXISTED CERTAINLY YOU DON'T KNOW. HOW THE? ENVIRONMENT IMPACT IS GOING TO AFFECT THAT PARTICULAR BUDGET APPRECIATE YOU STATING THAT UP FRONT. CERTAINLY I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL IF IN FACT THIS PROJECT CAN GET OFF THE GROUND. AND I THINK THAT IS DEMONSTRATED BY YOUR LEADERSHIP. BEING BROUGHT HERE TO THE COMMITTEE. AND ALSO YOUR NEW ROLE RESPONSIBILITY. LET ME ASK YOU JUST THIS THIS QUESTION CAN WE GET IT DONE. YEAH I BELIEVE SO I MEAN. I HAD A PRETTY GOOD JOB. BUT I TOOK THIS ONE BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE IN THIS PROJECT I THINK IT'S THE MOST. A TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT I'VE SEEN IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF WORKING TRANSPORTATION POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK IT PROVIDES MOBILITY ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS LIKE. NO PROJECT I'VE SEEN BEFORE. SO. YOU LOOK WE GOT WORK TO DO. WERE GONNA NEED TO PARTNER WITH YOU WE'RE GONNA NEED A CONTINUING PARTNERSHIP WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET IT DONE. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROPOSE IN THIS PLAN AND RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES IN THE CHAIRMAN DID A FINE JOB OF ARTICULATING. ALL THE RISKS THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN OPERATING. UNDER. YOU KNOW I I I THINK YOU KNOW OUR JOB IS TO IS TO. YOU KNOW PUSH TOWARD AS WE SAID MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE TO PROVIDE THE ME BENEFITS THAT PROVIDE AS WE GO. AND ISOLATE THE ISSUES THAT NEED FUNDING. GOING FORWARD AND OF THAT'S WHAT WE'VE LAID OUT IN THIS PLAN. THE PROJECT HAS AS I SAID REPORT ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND MOBILITY BENEFITS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND. ON YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TO. TO BRING THIS THING TO. TO FRUITION. THANK YOU. STAR FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OF. I WANT A FALL OPEN ISSUE THAT I BROUGHT UP A LAST YEAR AND. IT KIND OF. MORE ELABORATE I THINK WITH THE POINTS THAT. AND MEMBER FONG THE SENATE TRYING TO OUT BRING OUT THE VICE CHAIR. AYE IN THAT'S ABOUT. YOU KNOW I'M PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROJECT A BE BEING COMPLETED BUT IN THE. WORST SITUATION I SEE IS THAT IF SOMETHING GETS PARTIALLY COMPLETED AND WHAT DOES PARTIALLY GET COMPLETED IS INTERVIEWS. SO THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE TO KEEP ALWAYS ASKING ABOUT THE QUESTION OF COMPATIBILITY. WITH EXISTING AMTRAK STOCK WITH NORTH AMERICAN STANDARD GAUGE THAT FOR. FOUR FOOT TO EIGHT AND A HALF INCH. STANDARD GAUGE SO THAT I IF I YOU YOU BUILD UP A NICE PATH RIGHT DOWN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THEN THAT CAN BE USED BECAUSE THE CURRENT PROBLEM WITH AMTRAK AYE IS THAT IT USES RIGHT OF WAY THAT SIR. NOT LEAST FROM A PRIVATE COMPANIES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE. THE PRECEDENCE OVER THEIR FREIGHT STOCK IN THAT IT ENDS UP BEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST UP PROBLEMS WITH THEIR EXISTING AMTRAK SYSTEM. AYE IS A HAVING TO YIELD. AND SO. YEAH QUESTION I'M TRYING TO GET THE HARD AT IS ARE WE BUILDING ON THAT STANDARD GAUGE SO THERE'S THAT. BACK COMPATIBILITY. THAT IT CAN BE USED BY AMTRAK OR STANDARD LA FREIGHT OR PASSENGER. IF OF WE AYE. FISHER CUT BATES SITUATION. OF WE ARE UTILIZING STANDARD GAUGE OF FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE THE THE PROJECT I THINK. THE ISSUE MAY BE FOR SOME CRITICALLY FREIGHT AND I'LL I'LL BE CANDID HERE. THE BENEFIT OF THE PROJECT IN MANY WAYS AND WHAT SETS IT APART FROM OTHER PASSENGER RAIL. THAT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT FOR LARGE STRETCHES OF IT IT DOESN'T CHAIR RAILROAD WITH FRIGHT. IT DOESN'T SHIPS ARE CHAIR RIGHT AWAY OR OR. WHO WITH FREIGHT WHICH WHICH MAKES IT A NO CAPABLE OF TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEEDS AND? DOES NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR A FREIGHT TRAFFIC TO MOVE SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT. DISTINCTION. FOR THIS PROJECT BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER. STANDARD GAUGE IS WHAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD WITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. SIMILAR BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY AYE AYE. PLEASED WITH THE EXPERTISE THAT YOU BRING TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THE BACKGROUND I MEAN IT'S IT'S A. IT IS GOOD TO SEE GIVEN THE CHALLENGES FACING THE PROJECT AYE AYE ASK A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT QUESTION AND CANNOT BE DONE AND REALLY BE FOCUSING ON SHOULD IT BE DONE. BECAUSE EVERY PENNY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS GOING INTO THE PROJECT OR HAS IT GONE INTO IT YET YOU'LL SAY WE NEED. CAN BE SPENT ELSEWHERE COMES FROM SOMEWHERE IT COULD BE INVESTED ON THE BOOK AND PROJECTS THAT CAN BE PUT IN SO MANY OTHER. PROJECTS THAT NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS IN GREAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE BUT ACTUALLY IMPROVE MOBILITY. AND I I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE. PEER REVIEW GROUP WHICH IS DONE GREAT WORK. ONE OF THE FOUR OPTIONS THEY LAY OUT EARLY ON IN THEIR REPORT IS TO AND IT. AND THE PROJECT TAKE A LOOK AT AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. IT'S KIND LIKE THE CARTOON WHERE THERE'S A TRAIN GOING IN THEIR BUILDING THE TRACKS AS THEY GO AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER AND PRETTY SOON. YOU YOU WONDER WHERE IT'S GONE. THAT TO ME IS A LITTLE BIT HOW THE PROJECT FEELS NOT ANY REFLECTION ON THE EXPERTISE OF THOSE HAS BEEN WORKING NOT JUST HOW DEFAULT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. SO THAT THAT SCENARIO THAT THEY HAVE EVEN THE SECOND SCENARIO WHICH IS TO COMPLETE SOME OF IT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. YEAH I HAVE CONSTITUENTS IN THE BAY AREA SAY I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THOSE. DOLLARS CAN BE SPENT BETTER. AND AND SO LET'S END IT AND MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE WHY SHOULDN'T WE END IT. INSTEAD OF CONTINUE ON AND POSSIBLY LIKE THAT CARTOON PUTTING THE RAIL IN FRONT OF US AS WE AS WE MOVE ALONG. WELL I'D SAY A COUPLE THINGS OF ONE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND BUSINESS PLAN DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEPARTURE IN THE STRATEGY. A GOING FOR FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WOULD BILL BUILT FIRST AND AND THE DIRECTION WE WOULD GO. IS CONSISTENT AND COULD CONTINUOUS SO. SO I I. I AGREE A ONE ONE HOP AROUND AND I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WE DO. THIS GETS BACK TO WHAT I SAID A MINUTE AGO ABOUT THE PROJECT WHY SHOULD WE CAN TO. FOR ME THE GREATEST VALUE OF THIS PROJECT. AND A VALUE THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROJECT IN MY TIME HERE. IS THE MOBILITY BENEFIT FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL. I THE IDEA THAT WE CAN BUILD SOMETHING AND REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES. VERSES A CAR FOR EXAMPLE GOING FROM STAMPS ES GO TO LA FROM SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS. TO THREE OR LESS IS. THE OUTSTANDING HAND AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM THE BAY AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY. INSTEAD OF A SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR HOUR TRIP ON THE HIGHWAYS. TO DO IT IN JUST OVER AN HOUR IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER I THINK IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE MOVE. I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE AROUND THE WORLD. WERE HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS BEEN. PUT INTO PLACE AND SO IN TERMS OF THE SHOULD FOR ME. IT'S THAT KIND OF MOBILITY DIFFERENCE THAT I CAN'T NAME ANY OTHER PROJECTS BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THE SIMPLE REALITY WHICH MY COLLEAGUES ARE TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY. IS THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY LANES YOU BUILD CARS ON THE HIGHWAY. CAN'T GO TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR. BUT HIGH SPEED TRAINS CAN'T. AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN CUTTING TRAVEL TIME. AND SO. TO ME IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT TO REALLY GIVE CALIFORNIANS. AN OPTION TO MOVE AROUND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TODAY IN SEVERELY CUT TRAVEL TIMES IN WHAT IS OTHERWISE A VERY CONGESTED. THE SITUATION AROUND OUR STATE. SO SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE WHY FOR ME AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE STRATEGY WE LAY OUT IN THE PLAN. IS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT LOST INVESTMENTS AND WOULD NOT BE STRANDED INVESTMENTS EXTENDING. THE ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION A CALTRAIN THE BAY AREA TO GILROY. WILL HAVE SOME INTERIM BENEFITS FOR CALTRAIN SOME LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR US. FLOTILLA SAME ABOUT THE OF THE. THE STRUCTURES WERE BUILDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY ARE REQUIREMENTS TO PUT THOSE IN THE USE. AND WE WOULD CONTINUE. TO DO SO FINAL POINT IS THAT. THE CAP AND TRADE A DOLLARS ALSO HAVE TO. HAVE TO RESULT IN SOME GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BENEFITS NOT EVERY TRANSPORTATION PROJECT CAN ACHIEVE THAT AT THE LEVEL THAT THAT THIS ONE CANCER THERE'S ALSO INAPPROPRIATENESS. TO THOSE FUNDS BEING USED FOR THIS PROJECT IN IN OUR ESTIMATION. THANK YOU IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE TO HERE YOUR YOUR HOW HOW YOU LAY THAT OUT LIKE WHY WHEN WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE QUESTION SHOULD WE STOP. WHAT DO ONE OF THE CENTRAL PART OF YOUR ANSWER WAS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE THERE'S GONNA BE IMPROVE MOBILITY? THAT COMPARED TO A CAR. HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL GO FASTER. AND THERE HAVE BEEN CRITICISMS AND ANOTHER WILL HEAR THEM ALL OUT HERE ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BE HIGH SPEED WHETHER ITS SHARING RIGHTS OF WAY WHETHER SHARON TO FOR TRACK. AND STATE THE COMPARISON FIRST OF FIRST OF ALL THAT IT WILL BE TWO TO THREE HOURS. AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC THAT IS REALLY GREATLY THAT THE CREDIBILITY OF THAT HAS. IT'S BEEN LOST. AND THAT THE COMPARISON IS WITH A VEHICLE WHEN WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S MOVING FORWARDS AND SO MANY WAYS YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL AS. YOU KNOW BAY AREA MOBILITY OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO ABILITY THAT THE AMOUNT OF MOBILITY PERMITS WE CAN MAKE WITH THESE DOLLARS MIGHT NOT BE FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO BUT MIGHT BE ALL AROUND THE GREATER BAY AREA ALL AROUND THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL AROUND. LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THEY JUST WOULDN'T BE SPENT ON HIGH SPEED RAIL SO TO ME. I ALSO LOOK FOR THE GREATER MOBILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS JUST I DON'T SEE IT AS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE IT IS. THROUGH THIS PROJECT I THINK IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN A QUESTION ON THE FIRST ONE NOW I CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. THE COMPARISON YOU'RE MAKING THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TWO TO THREE HOUR RIDE FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN SO MANY OTHER PROMISES ABOUT THE PROJECT HAVE FAILED TO BE KEPT. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW OUR OPERATING GUIDELINE IN THE FOLKS WHO. DO THE OPERATION DESIGN WORK FOR THIS PROJECT ARE GUIDED BY THE REQUIREMENTS PROP ONE A. LOT AND THAT IS A DESIGN REQUIREMENT TO. BE ABLE TO TO. OPERATE THE SYSTEM THAT IT TOURISM FORTY MINUTES BETWEEN CHANCES GOING LOS ANGELES. ISN'T DESIGNED MATTER WE WILL DESIGN TO THAT WILL HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STATION STOPS. SO. IT WILL BE IT WILL BE DESIGNED TO MEET THE CRITERIA PROP ONE IS NOT RACIONAL MATTER IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER WAS STATION STOPS TO BE SAFE THREE HOURS. OF TO GO FROM SEPSIS COULD A LOS ANGELES BUT AGAIN VERSES YOUR TRAVEL OPTIONS TODAY FAIRY THAN A TRAIN OR CAR. IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. CONFERENCE ARE HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES TO THREE HOURS WHEN THIS IS BUILT THIS CAN BE YOU PERSONALLY I UP YOUR CONFIDENCE IN. WELL AGAIN THE DESIGN CRITERIA IS THE TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES TO TRAVEL TIME WAS STATION STOPS WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THAT OKAY BUT I I'M CONFIDENT. CERTAINLY THAT WILL BE IN A TO FORTY TO YOU KNOW THREE TWENTY ARISE AND. FROM SOME DEPENDING ON HOW TO STOP TO MAKE YOU WHICH STRAIGHTER ON EXPRESS SOURCES NOT EXPRESS. AM. IT AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS HAS THAT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE SPEED BECAUSE WE'RE COMPARING YEAH DIFFERENT ERA IS THE SHARED YOUR LINES YES. AND YOU HAVE EXAMPLES OF HOW FAST YOU CAN GO ON A SHARED LINE YES. IN THE AREAS WERE IN URBAN AREAS AND WE HAVE SHARED CORRIDORS LIKE IN THE. BURBANK TO ANAHEIM AREA AND IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND CALTRAIN. STRETCH. YOU KNOW FOR STRETCHES OF THAT THE IN THOSE RELATIVELY SMALL STRETCHES OF OF MOVEMENT WILL TRAVEL BETWEEN HUNDRED TEN. UNDER TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE. BUT THE BULK OF THE TRAVEL THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL BE IN EXCESS OF TO MILES PER HOUR. WELL IT AND A SLIGHTLY VARIOUS CENTRIC YEAH THINKING OF THE THE SAN JOSE AREA OF SAN JOSE AND GILROY YOURS ALL ALONG THAT. THAT LINE. HOW FAST IS THAT GONNA GO THINK ONE TEN IS OUR ESTIMATE TODAY? AND WHEN YOU MENTION THAT STE IT'S WHERE THEY WERE COMING HEARING IS BECAUSE PROP ONE A SAID IT HAS TO BE. ABOUT THREE HOURS WE HAVE BE ATTEMPTED DESIGNED THAT WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE PROMISED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE WILL HAVE YEAH THE DESIGN CRITERIA THAT'S IN THE BOND BILL IS FOR TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES AYE CRITERIA WE'RE DESIGNING IT TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT. AND. I AYE. THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS PROMISED AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IS WELL BE DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW WERE HOW WE'RE GONNA BE THERE PARTICULARLY WITH THE SHARE TRACK AND THAT AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. BUT I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE THE PERSON IS TRYING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. AND FIND SOME WAY TO GET THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER DALY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AS YOU MENTIONED. THE STRANDED COST ISSUE WERE. AS TO BE DEALT WITH IN IT ON MY LIKE. WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE FOCUSED ON? IN THAT AREA. AND ONE EXAMPLE IS THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM. SEGMENT. WHICH. EVEN IF THE LINE NEVER. GETS OVER THE TEHACHAPI HE'S. WHICH IS MY REAL QUESTION IS. HIS IS THAT CHALLENGE OF. TUNNELING OR GOING OVER THE TEHACHAPI MOUNTAINS FROM PALMDALE TO BURBANK. ON I LIKE THE IMPROVEMENTS FROM BURBANK TO ANAHEIM. BUT IT'S REALLY NOT A. STATEWIDE SYSTEM. AND DOESN'T MEDIAN TEN OF THE OF THE VOTERS. IF IT NEVER GETS. FROM BAKERSFIELD TO LA. OR. PAPPOINTS PALMDALE EXCUSE BUT. TO BURBANK. HAS THERE BEEN ANY PROGRESS. THE TECHNOLOGY. OR WORTH THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. FOR THAT LINK. BECAUSE ALL THE READING I'VE DONE. IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING. MORRELL MORE COMPLICATED MORE AND MORE CHALLENGING. MAY BE COST PROHIBITIVE. AS SOON AS A. ELECTED OFFICIAL INIS SOMEONE WHO LOOKS TO HOW MUCH THINGS COST. TO GET FROM PALMDALE TO BURBANK NOT TO MENTION THE NIMBY ASPECTS IN OTHER OPPOSITION BUT JUST THAT DOLLARS IN SO ANY PROGRESS ON THAT. YET WHAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON ASSESSING DIFFERENT ALIGNMENTS. THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE A TUNNELING. THROUGH. THE TO DETACH APPEASE. I THINK WE HAVE ON THE ORDER OF. A MORE THAN ONE TUNNEL I THINK WITH A FIFTEEN MILE AN EIGHT MILE. TUNNEL. YEAH IN THAT IN THAT STRETCH SO. EIGHT AND LOOK IT WHILE IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMMON AND PERHAPS IN AMERICAN CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA. FOR THAT LEVEL OF TUNNELING. IT IS ACHIEVED THE AROUND THE WORLD A THIRTY THREE MILE TUNNEL JUST RECENTLY OPENED IN SWITZERLAND. THEY BUILD A TUNNELING THROUGH MOUNT A SERIES FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ALL OVER THE GLOBE WHERE THEY HAVE IT. AND WE WILL BE UTILIZING OF THAT KIND OF EXPERTISE WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR OPTIONS. A HERE SO WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES FROM THE PALMDALE TO BURBANK SCENARIO ALL OF THEM. HAVE TOTALING ELEMENTS IN THEM AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE PER PRESENTED IN THE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND WE FURTHER REFINE. THE DESIGN OF THE SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THE COST OF THE COST LEVEL IT HAS A HIGH SWING. IT COULD BE AS LOW AS TWELVE HOURS HIGHS TWENTY FIVE TO GET THROUGH THAT THAT SECTION AND SO. YOU DO THINGS LIKE. FURTHER THE DESIGN REFINEMENT OF OF THAT YOU BRING IN EXPERTISE TO. A PROVIDE OPTIONS. TO TO MOVE THROUGH THEIR. AND YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTING AWAY USING THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY TO. TO PROVIDE. LOW COST MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY. EFFORT AND THAT'S. OUR DUTY GOING FORWARD IS WE WE WORK ON THIS PROJECT BUT BUT THOSE ARE THE. THREE ALTERNATES DOWN THERE ALL INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT. THANK YOU. CLEARLY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF PEOPLE THE SPELL. WRITER. OF MISTER KACZYNSKI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF HER YOU KNOW MISTER HOW THE PRICING STORY I'M A I'M THIS POLITICS OF PRESENTATION WAS. DON'T STEER TAKEN SOME BOTH IN THE REVENUE AND TAX. AND WHAT REAL QUICK QUESTION AND THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION CLOSE TO THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT. IS WHEN CAN WE ACTUALLY SEE THE I HAVE EVER SINGLE TWELVE WE'VE WHEN CAN WE SEE THE FIRST TRAIN ARRIVING IN DURING A STATION. IS THERE ANY MASCULINE. A COUPLE ANSWERS THAT THE FIRST IS. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CALTRAIN PARTNER ON THE ELECTRIFICATION OF THAT. CORRIDOR. WE PROPOSE IN THIS PLAN TO ELECTRIFY FURTHER SOUTH ALL THE WAY TO GILROY. CURRENTLY THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT TO SAN JOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO. WE'D LIKE TO COMPLETE THAT WORK UNDER THIS PLAN AND. DO SOME WORK WITH OUR EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR TO SEE IF WE CAN'T GET. BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. CAMINO REAL ROY. HE OUGHT YES HOLLYWOOD GILROY IN CRIME. AND THERE'S PRETTY MUCH ANTICIPATING THAT THEIR HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BE. COMING SHALL SHARE SHARING A YET TO GILROY SAN JOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO WE BE SHARING THAT QUARTER AT THAT TIME. WITH WITH WITH CALTRAIN PLUS THE BLAND THAT SAYS YEAH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S CORRECT. GREAT AUNT CANSECO QUESTION WAS THROUGH THEM. REGARDING TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. YOU KNOW YOU THE WAY I KNOW THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OFF A CAP AND TRADE MONEY. IT WILL GO TO THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM GUARANTEES ARE YOU TALKING THEIR FILE AND. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR OF WHICH IS TO LOW ESTIMATE. OR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE HIGHEST YET TODAY. WE HAVE A A PERCENTAGE SHARE COULD CONTINUES THE APPROPRIATE OUT A CAP AND TRADE A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RIGHT AND. IF WE WERE TO. REPLACE THAT WITH A DOLLAR VALUE WE. I THINK OUR ESTIMATE HERE WE WE CAN WE DO A LOT OF THINGS IN RANGES HERE WE HAD A LOW RANGE USING THE FIVE HUNDRED. AND A MEDIUM RANGE USING THE SEVEN FIFTY HAVE PER YEAR. I THINK BASED ON THE LAST THREE AUCTIONS WE BROUGHT IN A SINCE AB THREE NINETY EIGHT PASSED WE BROUGHT IN. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST THREE AUCTIONS WITH ONE MORE TO GO SINCE THAT BILL PASSED SO. WE HAVE INVESTMENT OF YOU KNOW SEVEN FIFTY AS A REASONABLE BASELINE A GOING FORWARD. TWOSOME FIFTIES TO BASELINE THAT A LITTLE WORSE YOU KNOW WHO CAN NOW GET SOME HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CAP AND TRADE. BILL WOULD HAVE TO A. YOU MOVE SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND WHOSE. TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM. WELL I I'M BARKING ONLY BECAUSE THE AGAIN UNDER CURRENT LAW WE'VE. LIVED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT COMMITMENT AND HOW MUCH THAT TURNS INTO ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH CAPITA IT BRINGS IN. IN TOTALITY. SOVIET IF YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OF THAT THE COULD BE MUCH HIGHER IN THE OUT YEARS SO WE BE HIGHER I GUESS. WHAT WE WERE SAYING HERE FOR GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH A DOLLAR SIGN LEVEL SEVEN FIFTY? WOULD BRING US ABOUT THE TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY BILLION THAT WE'VE REFERENCE IN THIS PLACE. YOU KNOW MARK MARK. GETS ON. I JUST FILLED OUT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A PERCENTAGE LEVEL AND POSTED THAT THE CAP ENTRY A MONEY. FLUCTUATING UP AND DOWN KNOW YOU'RE GIVEN US AND. AND ARE ABSOLUTE. DOLLAR AMOUNT SOME HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THEM MONEY REQUIRED W. SOLVED THE GENERAL FUND. TO TO TO BACKFILL THE DIFFERENCE. THAT WOULD BE I SUPPOSE TRUE ONLY IF A THAT WAS A. YOU KNOW A FIRM FLOOR ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT A SILLY THAT WOULD BECOME FROM THE GENERAL FUND I MEAN I THINK. BEGIN WE'VE SAID HERE IS NOT OR IF THERE WAS A DOLLAR DOLLAR SIGN BASELINE. NO SEVEN FIFTY WOULD GET US THIS MUCH VERSES ARE PERCENTAGE AMOUNT TODAY. WHAT'S. BUT I LIKE TO POINT OUT MY CONCERT TICKET. WE HAVE A QUESTION IS. CLEAVED PAL. SO. MY SCHOOL YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS LESSONS LEARNED AND I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR SKILL LOW HERE. AND. SOME OF THE EXPENSE OF LESSONS LEARNED. IT WAS THE RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION. HOW WAS YOUR PURPOSEFULLY P. ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD I MEAN WHAT I'M A CONTRACTOR ALWAYS? NEVER BUILT TO HOUSE THEM PROPERTY NEVER OWNED. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT THIS SIERRA KIND HAS THE CONCEPT OF BUILDING THE PLANE ON THE RUNWAY. PARA SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE ICE ALSO AS YOU KNOW WE BOTH SERVED ON THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD TOGETHER. AND WE SAW ONE EMINENT DOMAIN. COMING TOWARDS US. OF FROM THAT PROCESS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE. NOW. ABOUT HOW THEY WERE TREATED BUT THEY WERE TOLD. AND SO. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO MOVING FORWARD TO ACQUIRE THIS AND AND OTHER APPROPRIATE FASHION THAT ALSO? IS A VALUE NOT ONLY TO THE PROJECT BUT THE TAXPAYERS WERE PAYING FOR IT GREAT LESSONS LEARNED. FROM THIS PROJECT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT. ABOUT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE COST INCREASES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THIS PLAN. ARE TIED TO HAVING GONE INTO CONSTRUCTION OR ISSUE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WITHOUT ALL THAT THE RIGHT AWAY. A IN HAND AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IS THEN. REQUIRED US TO BUY ADDITIONAL RIGHT OF WAY TO STAY AHEAD OF THE. A CONTRACT CA CONTRACTOR. AND HAD HIS PAY SOME DELAY CLAIMS BECAUSE OF THAT. ALSO IF YOU DON'T ALL RIGHT AWAY YOU DON'T A LAWYER THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS AND YOU DON'T KNOW. ALL UTILITY RELOCATIONS. SO THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WERE LET BEFORE ALL THAT RISK WAS IDENTIFIED IN FULLY MITIGATED. THAT IS THE PRIME LESSON LEARNED HERE THAT WE WOULD BE. IMPLEMENTING GOING FORWARD IS THAT WE WOULD NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN WILL HAVE THAT RISK MUCH BETTER IDENTIFY MUCH MORE. IDENTIFIED MANAGING MITIGATED BEFORE WE GO TO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. ON RIGHT AWAY ITSELF WE HAVE REALIGNED. THE RIGHT OF WAY AND THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT. THAT DUTY IN OUR ORGANIZATION. TO. A NEW MANAGER. LAWYER THAT WE HAVE. REASSIGNED STRICTLY TO THAT. PURPOSE. HEADED VACANCY IN OUR DIRECTOR OF REAL PROPERTY THAT WE ARE NOW FILLING. AND. WE'RE PUTTING IT. ALL UNDER THE AN EXPEDITED LEGAL PROCESS WITHIN. A WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. WERE ALSO A WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CONTRACTORS TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL PATH PARCELS THAT NEED TO BE. A PRIORITIZED. AS WE GO FORWARD. AND WE ARE OF THROWING OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HIRING MORE RESOURCES TO FOCUS ON THE RIGHT AWAY. THE RIGHT AWAY A ISSUE -- SO WHAT WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THINGS TO MOVE FORWARD ON THAT I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IS A LITTLE UNUSUAL FOR A LINEAR TRANSPORTATION PROJECT OF THE PROCESS THAT WE USE IS MORE -- FAMILIAR FOR -- FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING BUILT DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I TYPICALLY DON'T GO TO THE PUBLIC WORKS -- BOARD -- AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY USED AT DTS SO WE WOULD BE SEEKING -- TO -- FIND -- WORK WITH YOU ON THE RIGHT AWAY FOR YOU MIRRORS MORE WHAT CALTRANS A DOES -- IN THEIR PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN A SELF DO SEVERAL THINGS UNTIL THEY -- -- SORT OF THE YEAH WHAT'S THE TERM I'M LOOKING FOR THEY CAN -- ON THEIR OWN DO THINGS LIKE APPRAISALS NEGOTIATIONS -- AND OTHER THINGS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE DDS A PROCESS THAT IS MORE COMMON FOR TRANSPORTATION D. W. ARE LINEAR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS I WILL BE WORKING WITH OF LEGISLATORS ON AYE THAT AUTHORITY HERE SO WE CAN EXPEDITE OUR OUR PROCESS AS WELL SO THOSE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU MENTIONED SECURING DOLLARS OF -- REALLY CAP AND TRADE IF THAT WASN'T BROUGHT FORWARD IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE GENERAL FUND HAVE TO MAKE THE CAP I MEAN IT'S NOT A YOU KNOW IT IT'S A COUPLE THINGS IT'S IT'S NOT A SO THE GENERAL FUND FIRST OF ALL I MEAN WE ARE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS A BUSINESS PLAN IS TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF A OF AN ANNUAL TOTAL THAT'S CAP AND TRADE -- DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING FORWARD -- ACCORDING TO ALEJO WITH THE LID LOW RANGES FIVE HUNDRED THE HIGH RANGE IS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION -- WE'VE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES PUT SEVEN FIFTY IN THIS A PLAN -- AS A AS A -- -- PLANNING -- MATTER TRYING TO ESTIMATE WHAT WOULD BE REASONABLE NUMBER WE TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT IT -- AND OTHERS AND THAT'S THAT'S A NUMBER THAT WE PLUGGED IN HERE SO IF WE WERE TO REPLACE THE PERCENTAGE WITH A DOLLAR SIGN AND WE WANTED TO MAKE IT FINANCES WILL WE WOULD WANT TO TRY TO MAKE THAT A FLOOR OF SOME KIND BUT WHETHER THAT WAS -- WHETHER THE FLOOR WAS -- SOME COMMITMENT WAS MADE FROM OTHER CAP AND TRADE MONIES OR SOMETHING ELSE REMAINS TO BE SEEN IS UNNECESSARILY IT IN GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT SO THEN I DID AGAIN IF WE'RE IDENTIFYING A NUMBER IS ONE OF THOSE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE BACKSTOPS A ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IS MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CAP AND TRADE IS AT SOME POINT IN TIME IT HAS A DIMINISHING AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT COMES IN BECAUSE YOU'RE USING IT FOR MITIGATION AND AS A RESULT -- ACQUIRE THAT YOU DON'T NEED AS MUCH MONEY COMING IN SO THIS WAS HAVE A DOWNSLOPE OF INCOME AND NOW WE'RE SAYING I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE DRAFT PLAN EITHER ASSUMES IT'S A STATIC OR AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF REVENUE I DON'T THINK THAT WAS IN A PURPOSES OF A GOING OUT HIS A. B. THIRTY TWO SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HIS REDEFINING CAP AND TRADE WITH AN EXTENSION IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FUND FOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN A PLAYER YEAH YOU KNOW THE THE EXTENSION AND MISTER CHAIRMAN IS IS JUST THE CONSISTENCY WITH -- THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN HAVE PLANNED THAT CAP AND TRADE FOR PURPOSES OF FUNDING HERE WOULD BE AVAILABLE TILL TWENTY FIFTY WE DID A TALK TO CARBON DOUBT THAT THEY'VE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS THEY EXPECTED CAP AND TRADE WOULD BE AN ELEMENT OF OUR -- CLIMATE CHANGE PROPOSALS GOING FORWARD -- WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT OVER TIME -- YOU WOULD HOPE THERE'S A DIMINISHING -- AMOUNT YOU ALSO SEE THE EXPENSIVE GO UP -- AND SO -- -- WE MADE WE THOUGHT WAS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF AB SEVEN FIFTY BASED ON ESTIMATES WE'VE SEEN WHAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM COULD LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD SO WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON THIS PROJECT WHOSE COMPANIES EMPLOYERS LABOR DATA AND I WHEN I WHEN I WALK THAT PROJECT IN ACTUALLY HA THE ARTISTRY OF THE WORKERS IS UNBELIEVABLE IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC -- AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THESE PEOPLE LIVE ACTUALLY RELOCATED TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THESE AREAS -- IN FROM THE TRADES IN AND AND AND VENDORS AND WHAT NOT OF SO WE LOOK AT THE VIEW OF THE BUSINESS PLAN AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE DEBT SERVICE THERE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID ON ANY MONEY FAR SO WE LOOK AT IT WILL IT SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WE DON'T GET FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE DON'T GET -- PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND SO NOW WE HAVE A SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR THAT WELL IN OVER THIRTY YEAR PERIOD OF TIME IT WOULD COST US ACT IT'S ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE THE LOOK AT THE TOTAL BURDEN OF THE PROJECT AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S AN OBLIGATION WE HAVE AS LEGISLATORS TO COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PACKAGE IT TELLING US WHAT'S AND COST REAL TIME DOLLARS BUT NOT THIRTY YEARS THAT THE DEBT THAT WERE OCCURRING FOR FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S WOMEN PEOPLE THAT O'NEILL GOING FORWARD SO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCLUDED A AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL I MEAN PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ON THIS PROJECT WORDS ASTRONOMICAL OF IT ALL AND THE CLEAR BENEFIT THAT THIS PROJECT DOES BRING FOR REDUCTIONS EVENTUALLY HOW THAT THERE'S BEEN NO OF CREDIT GIVEN UP IN IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THOSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT MAN UNITED YOU KNOW HOW THE EARLY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EXORBITANT COST OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE ACTUALLY ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF A KIND OF AN OXYMORON REALLY -- BUT THAT NEARLY CLOSER SOME OF THINGS BUT IN IN THE DRAFT IS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SEE REAL TIME NUMBERS OKAY OF JUST ONE COMMENT ON THAT MR CHAIRMAN THERE IS A A CHART OF THE COSTS SECTION IN THAT CHART IT NOTES HAVE FOR CAPITAL COSTS THE ACTUAL AMOUNT WE WOULD BRING IN IS IN EXCESS OF THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW SOME OF IT WOULD BE PAID FOR FINANCING BECAUSE AGAIN WE WANT TO BRING THE DOLLARS RIGHT FOR TO MEET OUR CAPITAL EXPENSES SO IT WOULD WE WOULD ACTUALLY GENERATE MORE THAN THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE CAPITAL COSTS BUT AGAIN WE WOULD PROPOSE TO FINANCE WE CAN GET THE WORK DONE SAID ONE WE ALSO KNOW THAT PICKED AS IT GETS MORE COSTLY AS TIME GOES ON BECAUSE WE HAVE WHICH IS THE GO UP IN COSTA MATERIALS AND AND AND AND PURCHASED INFLATION THE FACT OF IS IT GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE TO UTILIZE I MEAN THERE'S NO PUBLIC SUBSIDIES AROUND US IN THE BOND MEASURE AND SO I MEAN I I THINK I SAW SOMETHING WAS NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE THAT I WANT TO CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE THE FIELD OF DREAMS OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN SAN JOSE OR LA ABSOLUTELY I THINK IS PHENOMENAL BECAUSE I THINK THE CENTRAL VALLEY BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR MANY MANY YEARS OTHER THE PROP ONE BEER THING WE DROPPED A BILLION DOLLARS FOR NINETY NINE -- SO -- BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE THERE IS THERE A TIPPING POINT THAT YOU KNOW IS THIS ACTUALLY A A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SOME OF OUR WORK A PATH THAT WAS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE INTO PURPOSES YEAH I THINK OUR -- RIDERSHIP ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF THE TROOPS WOULD BE LEISURE TRIPS OF THE FORTY ONE I THINK BUSINESSES I THINK THAT'S THE BREAKDOWN -- THE NINETY THREE IS -- ESTIMATE OF FOR THE RIDERSHIP -- FIGURES THE IDEA IS TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH -- AIRLINE TRAVEL -- AN AIRLINE TICKET PRICES IN YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WITH THE TICKET PRICES ARE WILL WILL BE USING EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR THAT WHICH IS BROUGHT ON THIS YEAR -- TO HELP US WORK THAT THROUGH IN THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR DIFFERENT USERS A DEPENDING ON FREQUENCY OF HIMSELF OR YOU'RE TRAVELING ALL THOSE ONE LAST QUESTION SO SO WE'RE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR PLEASE WHAT THE COMMITTEE THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ACTION WILL NEED TO TAKE PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THE FUNDING PLAN YOU PROPOSE FOR JUST THE IOS WHAT DO YOU EXPLODED YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE I WELCOME THE IF WE ARE TO COMPLETE THE FINANCING ELEMENT OF THE CAP AND TRADE -- -- ULTIMATELY WE WOULD NEED TO STABILIZE THE KAPPA TRADE A AMOUNTS GOING TO THE PROJECT SO IT WOULD BE AN INVESTMENT GRADE -- REVENUE STREAM -- AND IN THAT REGARD WE NOTED IN THE PLAN THAT -- ULTIMATELY AN EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE A HELPFUL AT TWENTY FIFTY -- THAT THERE WOULD BE A OF A DEDICATED AMOUNT OF CAPITATE FOR THE PROJECT THAT IS A RELIABLE OVER TIME OF A FLOOR IF YOU WILL -- AND SOME COMMITMENT THAT THOSE THAT WOULD NOT BE A IN IMPAIR AMOUNT OF MONEY SO THOSE ARE THE THREE ELEMENTS TO MAKE SOMETHING INVESTMENT GRADE YOU'RE GOING TO FINANCE THE REVENUE STREAM SO THOSE OF THOSE ELEMENTS THAT WE WE NEED WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT MOVING TO FINANCING UNTIL AGAIN ROUGHLY THE TIMELINE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE ROUGHLY WILL ALSO BE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR WE HOPE AS I SAID EARLIER ON SOME OF THE RIGHT OF WAY PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR MATHIS SIR SO ONE ON MAY MAKE SURE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR IS YOUR YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE YOU'RE BETTING THIS ON FUTURE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS ARE CORRECT YEAH THAT'S THE ONLY SOURCE OF ONGOING REVENUE WE HAVE A GARAGE HERE'S MY BIGGEST QUESTION FOR HIM WITHIN THE THAT THE CAP AND TRADE YELLOW WE JUST NEGOTIATED THERE'S A CA ONE WHICH THEN GOES TO PROP SEVENTY SCARES THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE ABILITY VOTE ON THE FUNDS AND IF AT THAT POINT WE VOTE TAKE THE FUNDING AWAY FROM YOU QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BUSINESS MODEL PLAN FOR THE PROPOSITION ON THE BALLOT HERE AND A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOT KNOWING AND NOT HAVE ANY GUARANTEE THAT THAT VOTE WON'T CALM FOR THAT THAT PROPOSITION WON'T PASS SO SO YOU'RE BETTING ITS CHICKENS THAT ARE HATCHED YET ON ON MONEY THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE AND YOU'RE TELLING US THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL THIS IS YOUR PLAN BUT YEAH COME JUNE IF PROP SEVENTY PASSES THEN COME TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHEN WE HAVE THE VOTE YOU MAY BE DIE IN YOUR ARTICLE OFF A FEDERAL FUNDING THEN YOU MAY BE CUT OFF A STATE FUNDED SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU INTEND TO GET THE FUNDING IF THAT IS THE HALF AN OR HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO PROJECT FUNNY BEYOND THAT POINT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THERE'S NO CERTAINTY INTEL AFTER BOTH POINTS OF HAPPEN IF THE LEGISLATURE CUTS OFF FUNDING A YEAH WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- WHAT WHAT WHAT THIS PLAN DOES IS TRY TO LAY OUT A PLAN -- AND WHAT I WILL DO AND THEN TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN IS COME BACK TO YOU AND CONTINUE TO REFINE AND LAY OUT THE PROGRAM IN THE PLAN SO THAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND REDIRECTING CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THAT WE'VE LAID OUT A PROPOSAL FOR YOU IN A PLAN FOR YOU THAT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT THE BUT IF SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO DO THAT WILL HAVE A PROBLEM SAYS THE CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE ONE PLAN THERE'S NO PLAN B. YEAR I OTHER CONTINGENCY PLANS NO WE WE WERE WERE ALL LOOK WE'RE REQUIRED UNDER THE STATUTE TO ESTIMATE AND LAY OUT FOR YOU WHAT WE DO WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDS DEDICATED THE PROJECT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS PLAN OTHER FUNDS IDEA ADMIT BUT THAT'S BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PLAN BECAUSE AS THE CHAIRMAN TO SAY YOU HAVEN'T CALCULATED OUT THE COST OF INFLATION FOR FROM THE PROJECTS ACTUALLY AND WE DON SO IT'S WE HAVE IN OUR BECAUSE THIS IS A VALID COST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SCENE OF LIKE WITH THE INFLATION AND WITH WITH NEW I MEAN THE YEAH I I'M I'M I'M HONESTLY EXPECTING TO HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT THE TEARS GOING ON OF THE STILL COST TO OVER HERE BUT IT'S YOU HAVE NO GUARANTEE ON YOUR FUNDING SIR AMEN I AGREE WITH THAT WE HAVE NO GUARANTEE ON OUR FUNDING WHAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING WE NEED THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO BE SOLIDIFIED AND THAT'S WHY WE LAID OUT IN HERE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I'D I GOTTA SAY THAT I DON'T AGREE THAT WE'VE GOT BEEN CUT OFF PERMANENTLY WAS FROM FEDERAL PARTNERS I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO -- WE HAVE SUCH A DEDICATION THE STATE REVENUE FOR THIS PROJECT THAT I HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE MATTER WHAT LOOKS LIKE AND SOME SNAP IN AND IT'S NOT SNAPSHOT IN TIME WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK THAT PARTNERSHIP GOING FORWARD MISTER KELLY PLEASE GET THE REST OF US THAT THE CRYSTAL BALL THAT YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE I CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SCULLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PLEASE YEAH SO PLEASE MAKE US PROUD SO MOVE FORWARD WITH ITS NEXT PANEL LA JOH NA PEER REVIEW GROUP THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE SO MISTER KELLY IN YOUR GROUP IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST HANG AROUND QUE SOME QUESTIONS COME UP DURING THIS AFTER THIS PANEL WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU SO REALLY WHAT IT IS START WITH THE -- LA O. FIRST TOM WOULD YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN PROCEED GOOD AFTERNOON TIME HE WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SERGEANTS DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT THAT ALL BE REFERRED TO IT PARALLELS NETWORKS THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING THIS YEAR'S PART OF THESE PROCEEDINGS AS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A BUSINESS PLAN EVERY EVEN YEAR THAT PROVIDE CERTAIN KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM GENERALLY ARE OFFICE REVIEWS THAT PLANET OFFERS ANALYSIS LEGISLATURE THIS PRESENTATIONS GONNA PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON PLANTS SYSTEM I THINK IT'S USEFUL GIVEN THE NUMBER ACRONYMS AND COMPONENT PARTS THIS COMPLEX PROJECT TO JUST SET THE STAGE BILL DESCRIBING MAJOR CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN AND IDENTIFIES ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATIONS ON PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT THAT WE MAKE REFERENCE TO PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY EXCUSE ME -- WHICH SPECIFIED CERTAIN CRITERIA CONDITIONS THAT THAT'S THE REAL SYSTEM ASSAULTING EACH YEAR THAT'S REALLY HELP PROJECT GOT STARTED FOR EXAMPLE THE MEASURE REQUIRES ELECTRIC TRAINS CAPABLE OF OPERATING SPEEDS OF AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR SPECIFIES MINIMUM TRAVEL TIME TO ONE SPECIFIC ROUTES THE OVERALL PROJECT VISION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES PHASE ONE OF THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE SERVICE FOR ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM FACE TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM NORTH TO SACRAMENTO AND SOUTH TO SAN DIEGO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED PHASE ONE OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE AND COST ABOUT SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THE AUTHORITY IS NOT PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF THE COST OR SCHEDULE FOR FEES TO ON PAGE THREE ALL DISCUSS THE PROJECT DELIVERY PLAN FOR PHASE ONE DELIVERY PHASE ONE IS DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS AT PHASE ONE OF -- THAT YOUR PROJECTS TO WAITING TO TWO SEGMENTS FOR FOR A PURPOSE TODAY CRINKLY FORTY THE FIRST OPERATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE STATE WILL BE AFTER CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL OPERATING SECOND AT THE IOWA US THAT WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO THIS AFTERNOON THAT'S GOING TO CONNECT THE SILICON VALLEY TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE VALLEY TO VALLEY ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED THAT THE IOWA US WOULD COST ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS INITIALLY OPERATE BETWEEN SAN JOSE AND A TERMINUS NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD STARTING TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT BEGAN WITH THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE ICE YES EXTENDS FOR HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM THAT EUROPE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES NORTH OF FRESNO TO SHOW AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MILES NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATED COMPLETING CONSTRUCTION OF THE I CS AT A COST OF SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO DATE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE PROJECT HAS RECEIVED CAPITAL FUNDING PRIMARILY FROM THREE SOURCES THE FIRST OF THOSE OF COURSE ARE PROPOSITION ONE A BONDS THIS AUTHORIZES THE TO SELL TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AT THIS TIME STEVE IS SOLD OUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT MONTHS AND AS OF DECEMBER THE AUTHORITY IT'S BETTER COMMITTED ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT TOTAL FEDERAL FUNDS ARE THE SECOND MAJOR SOURCE OF CAPITAL FUNDING YOU THIRTIES RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TWO POINT SIX BILLION THAT IS FROM THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT THE AUTHORITY IS FULLY EXPENDED THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN SECOND STATE RECEIVING NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE FY TEN GRAND THAT IS NOT YET ACCESSES CO KELLY INDICATED FINALLY OF COURSE CAP INTRODUCTION REVENUES ARE THE THIRD AND MAJOR LEG OF THE STOOL STEVE BEGAN PROVIDING CAP INTRODUCTION PROCEEDS YOU FORTY -- IN THE MATTER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ANNUAL CONTINUES PREPARATIONS BEGINNING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AT THIS TIME A TOTAL OF ROUGHLY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS AND CAPTURED REVENUES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE FORTY AND AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN BEFORE IT SPENT ALMOST SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THOSE ONCE YOU FORTY ALREADY GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR FEATURES OF THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN SO I WON'T DWELL ON THE SKIRT FOR TOO LONG BUT BEGINNING ON PAGE FIVE WILL NOTE THAT WE'VE GOT A MAP INDICATING A THIEF ONE THE INITIAL OPERATIVE SEGMENT AND INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT THIS ARE SUBSETS OF OF THE OTHERS AND IT'S WORTH UNDERSCORING AGAIN THAT THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN PROPOSES TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE IOS EXTENDING IT TO SAN FRANCISCO IN TO BAKERSFIELD THAT'S CONNECTED TO A LARGER POPULATION CENTERS IT ALSO ASSUMES A DELAY IN THE OPERATION OF THAT I WEST NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE FOUR YEARS LATER THAN ASSUME IN THE SIXTEEN PLAN MAJOR FEATURE OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN -- YOU'RE YOU'RE THE TOP PAGE SIX AND HE PROPOSES EARLY INSURANCE SERVICES I COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION SEGMENTS PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE SIXTEEN PLAN NO REAL SERVICES WERE EXPECTED TO BEGIN UNTIL FOR COMPLETION OF THE IOWA US AS YOU'RE KILLING NOTED A THE AUTHORITY OF PROPOSES TO WATCH REALLY INTERESTS REVERSES ON THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY CORRIDOR AND ON COMPLETED ICE YES THE PLAN SUGGESTS THAT THOSE COMPLETED SEGMENTS COULD HOST ENHANCE CALTRAIN OR AMTRAK SERVICES WERE POTENTIALLY ABBREVIATED HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATIONS PRESIDENT STRUCTURE COSTS HAVE BEEN REVISED UPWARD AND BY ABOUT A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE WHOLE FEES ONE MOVING TO SIXTY FOUR TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT'S ABLE TO BOTTOM OF PAGE SIX SUMMARIZES THE ROUTING NUMBER THROUGH VARIOUS SEGMENTS OF THE PROJECT OKAY SEVEN WE DISCUSS THE PROJECT FUNDING PLAN THE DRAFT PLAN IDENTIFY SCHOOL FUNDING FOR THE ICS FROM VARIOUS FUN SOURCES INCLUDING PROPOSITION ONE A BONDS FEDERAL GRANTS AND CABINETRY REVENUES TO COMPLETE THE I WAS THE PLAN ASSUMES FURTHER EXTENSION OF CABINETRY AND SECURITIZATION OF THOSE REVENUES THIS PLAN IS THE CAPTURE PROGRAM EXCUSE ME IS CURRENTLY ONLY AUTHORIZED OF COURSE THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY FINALLY IT ASSUMES THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF FEES ONE THE BALANCE OF CONSTRUCTION OF FEES ONE THAT IS FROM BAKERSFIELD SOUTH TO ANAHEIM BLS ANGELES IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO COST FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WHILE THE PLAN DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCES IN AMOUNTS THE FUND THAT CONSTRUCTION IT DOES DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL SOURCES INCLUDING A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL SOURCES I'M BORROWING AGAINST THE NET OPERATING REVENUES AT THE IOWA US ON PAGE EIGHT WE CAN'T FOR ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION THE FIRST IS THE ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS COULD BE EVEN HIGHER THE AUTHORITY NOTED OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT PRESENT COSTS IN RANGES NAY DESERVE CREDIT FOR THAT I THINK IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE COST THE PROJECT COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN THE HEADLINE NUMBER SEVEN SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT UP TO AS HIGH AS NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FACT SEVERAL FACTORS NEED TO BE DECIDED THOSE INCLUDE FINAL DESIGN DECISIONS PROCUREMENTS AND THERE COULD BE CONSTRUCTION DELAYS THAT ARE HARD TO FORESEE AT THIS STAGE IN THOSE COULD ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECT THAT EVENTUAL ACTUAL COST THERE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING FUNDING TO COMPLETE THE IOS AS YOU NOTED A LARGE PORTION OF THE FUNDING IDENTIFY FOR THE AYE WEST WOULD COME FROM BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE CABINETRY AT AUCTION REVENUES THROUGH TWENTY FIFTY THE US WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO EXTEND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THE TOTAL CAP AND TRADE FUNDS YOU FORTY PLANS TO USE CLEARLY I LESS WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT LEVEL OF ACTION REVENUES ASSUMED IN THE DRAFT PLAN DOES NOT MATERIALIZE WITH COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IN THIS BASELINE ESTIMATES THE STATE WOULD NEED TO IDENTIFY OTHER FUNDS WERE SAID TO HELP FINANCE THE I WAS THE GENERAL FUND TO BE ONE OF THOSE SOURCES THERE'S NO COMPLETE FUNDING PLAN FOR THE REMAINDER OF FEES POINT WELL THE DRAFT PLAN DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF SECURE TIES IN THE NET OPERATING REVENUES AT THE I WAS THERE SEVERAL POTENTIAL CHALLENGE THIS APPROACH FIRST IT'S UNCLEAR THE INITIAL SYSTEM WILL ACTUALLY GENERATE NOT SURPLUS SECOND YOU THREE ANTICIPATES A SECURE TIES IN THE NET CASH FLOW WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE NEW SOONER THAN TWENTY THIRTY TWO EVEN THOUGH FUNDS WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED EARLIER TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE BY TWENTY THIRTY THREE HAS ASSUMED AND CLAMPED THIRD THE PLAN ESTIMATES THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT BE GENERATED WOULD FALL SUBSTANTIALLY SHORT OF THE LEVEL NEEDED TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY HOW THE SHORTFALL WILL BE MET AS I MENTIONED THAT BALANCE TO BE STRUCK XIN YES IT FOR THAT IS THE FORTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND THE PLAN INDICATES THAT SECURE TYPE THING AND OPERATING REVENUES MIGHT BRING IN TEN ELEVEN TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FINANCING PROCEEDS FINALLY ON PAGE NINE JUST UNDERSCORE BEFORE FUNDING PLANT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT AND AT THIS TIME TO COMPLETELY VIABLE FUNNY PLAN TO COMPLETE THE IRS AND THE MANGER FEES ONE DOES NOT EXIST RUSS BROWN IS OUR CABINETRY EXPERT IS HERE WITH ME AS WELL BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS NO MISTER CHAIRMAN HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU THINK YOU IT'S TWO THOUSAND UP MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY AND I WANT ESPECIALLY TO THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS YOU SAID ABOUT WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO SO FAR OF WE FOUND IT A GREAT PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR STAFF WE ARE ACUTELY CONSCIOUS OF THE DIFFICULTY IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS DECISIONS THAT YOU'RE FACING RIGHT NOW AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT IS I THINK WORTHWHILE WE VERY MUCH ENJOYED IT I WON APPROVED OF THE PRESENT -- MARTY BLACKS AS APOLOGIES A LAST MINUTE SCHEDULE PROBLEM -- I TOOK HIM OUT OF THIS -- I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PEER REVIEW OF COMMITTEE AS A GROUP THAT HAS LEGISLATURE A DIVIDEND SOME FIFTEEN REPORTS TODAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ON THE STATUS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WE SENT A LETTER TO THE -- CHAIRMAN AND THEN CHAIRMAN ON THE SENATE SIDE AS WELL COMMENTING ON THE DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN LAST FRIDAY I WANT TO SUMMARIZE THOSE COMMENTS -- TODAY THEY FALL INTO CATEGORIES OF ONE IS THE POLICY ISSUES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FACING AND THE OTHER IS SOME COMMENTS ON DE YET OF THE CONTENT WITH THE PLAN ITSELF AND I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS FIRST ON THE POLICY ISSUES BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT WE BELIEVE THAT THE HIGH SPEED PROJECT HAS NOW REACHED A CRITICAL POINT WHERE DIFFICULT DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE ABOUT THE PROJECT FUTURE SCOPE AND FUNDING QUITE SIMPLY AS A RESULT OF COST INCREASES IN CHANGES IN THE FUNDING SOURCES THE AUTHORITY CAN NO LONGER COMPLETE THE LINK FROM CENTRAL VALLEY EITHER TO THE LA BASIN ORDER SAN JOSE IN THE FINANCIAL THE US AS IT STANDS TODAY THERE IS LITTLE PROSPECT FOR A SYSTEM THAT WOULD GENERATE ENOUGH CASH FLOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE INVESTMENT THIS DILEMMA DOES NOT COME AS A SURPRISE IT HAPPENS NEARLY EVERY TIME WE TRY TO TRANSLATE A MEGA PROJECT FROM THE GRAND VISION INTO A WORKING SYSTEM AND IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A REFLECTION ON THE CONFIDENCE OR HONESTY OF THE PEOPLE AT THE AUTHORITY WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BUILD A SYSTEM THE CRITICAL QUESTION THOUGH IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE THE DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T REALLY LAY OUT THE CHOICES THE HUH IN ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION THE GROUP PLAYED OUT FOR BROAD OPTIONS BUT THESE WERE MEANT BASIC OF YOU PROVOKE A DEBATE THERE COULD BE OTHER OPTIONS THAT ANYONE COULD ENTER INTO THIS FIRST OPTION IS WE COULD JUST STOP STOP WHERE WE ARE PAY ALL OF WHAT WE HAVE TO PAY OFF AND AND CUT OUR LOSSES THE SECOND OPTION IS THAT WE COULD COMPLETE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BASICALLY AND CREATE WHATEVER VALUE WE COULD CREATE THEIR AND AND THE WORK THAT'S COMMITTED ON THE ENDS AND STOP THERE THE THIRD OPTION -- WE COULD DO WHAT AFFECT AND EFFECT THE BUSINESS PLAN IS SUGGESTING WHICH IS COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAD THE CONNECTIONS TO GILROY AND BAKERSFIELD AND IMPROVE LA UNION STATION WHILE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT DRACO PASSED TUNNELS ARE GOING TO COST AND HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT FINANCING THAT OR FOURTH WE COULD REALLY COMMIT TO THE FULL PHASE ONE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SUCH A DECISION WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED ON THE ADOPTION OF A CREDIBLE LONG TERM PLAN TO FINANCE THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT SYSTEM COST MIKE WILL COME IN AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE WE DON'T VIEW THE FIRST OPTION SIMPLY STOPPING AS CREDIBLE IT WOULD LEAVE US WITH NOTHING USEFUL AND WE WERE PROBABLY STILL HAVE TO PAY BACK THE FEDERAL ERA MONEY THE SECOND OPTION STOPPING WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY PLUS A BOOK AND IMPROVEMENTS WOULD WORK BUT IT WOULD LIMIT THE VALUE OF THE RESULT THE THIRD OPTION AS IN THE DRAFT PLAN PROBABLY MAKES THE BEST USE OF THE EXISTING SITUATION ESPECIALLY IN BRINGING NEAR TERM BENEFITS TO THE MILLIONS OF CURRENT PASSENGERS ON THE BOOKENDS BUT IT LEAVES THE STATE SHORT OF THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO FINANCING OF THE REMAINDER OF THIS BEFORE FOURTH OPTION WHICH WOULD BE COMPLETING PHASE A AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED DOES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROP ONE NAY BUT IT CANNOT BE DONE WITH CURRENT FUNDING PROVISIONS ARE SOURCES SIMPLY PUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FAIR A CREDIBLE ANY LONGER TO ASK MANAGEMENT TO DELIVER A LONG TERM PROJECT OF THIS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY WITH SOURCES OF FUNDING BETTER INADEQUATE IN TOTAL AND UNRELIABLE AND ANY GIVEN YEAR IF THE PROJECT IS TO GO AHEAD BEYOND ESSENTIALLY THE SECOND OPTION THE STATE WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT IS UP TO THE TASK THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FUNDING GAP OF SOME SIZE DEPENDING ON THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT COST IN INCOME IT WAS CLEAR IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUSINESS CLASS PLAN THAT THERE WAS A FUNDING GAP OF AROUND FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MEDIUM ASKED MONTH AND THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL TEN BILLION THAT WAS NEEDED TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE OF REVENUES COULD BE GENERATED FROM SELLING THE SERVICE ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND TWENTY BILLION THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE INVESTMENT MONEY FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR COULD BE GENERATED WHAT IS NEW IS THE INCREASING SIZE OF THE GAP ALONG WITH A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED TO MAKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES FUNDING STABLE AND PREDICTABLE THERE ARE OBVIOUS WAYS TO DEAL WITH THIS YOU COULD INCREASE TO SHARE OF CAP AND TRADE RECEIPTS GOING TO THE PROJECT YOU CAN GUARANTEE THEIR INCOME OR PERMIT THEM TO ISSUE SOME KIND OF GUARANTEE BLINDS AGAINST THE STATE AGAINST PREDICTED REVENUES THAT COULD BE A TAX ON FUELS LARA SALES TAX WAS PROPOSED IN THE TWO THOUSAND BUSINESS PLAN THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES THAT MIGHT EMERGE LIKE FUTURE FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAMS FEDERAL LANDS IT CETERA BUT THEN AGAIN THEY MIGHT NOT THE PROBLEM WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN ONE WHERE NO THERE IF EVEN THE THIRD OPTION OR BEYOND IS TO BE COMPLETED IN PARALLEL WITH DEALING WITH THE NEED FOR IMPROVED APPROACH THE FUNDING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE STATE'S ROLE IS LIKELY TO GO UP GROW WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE RE VALIDATE THE PRIORITY OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMPETING NEEDS ELSEWHERE IN THIS TRANSPORTATION TEN OVER WHAT ALL AND THAT STATE'S BUDGET THIS IS THE TASK OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT OR TRANSPORTATION ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED WOULD BE WELL SUITED TO CARRY OUT FOR THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW OF MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR QUESTION AND ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW BENEFITS OTHER THAN REVENUES AND COST THIS WAS ACTUALLY ADDRESSED AN EARLIER BUSINESS PLANS WITH THE DID ATTEMPT AN ECONOMIC A SOCIAL BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY AND HOW MUCH THAT WAS WORTH IT WOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT TO RE COMMISSION THAT KIND OF WORK AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WE DO HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC CHANGES IN THE FINAL PLAN ONE WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD BENEFIT FROM INCLUDING AND REPORTING ON THE END OF IT INPUTS FROM THE EARLY OPERATORS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE LONG ARGUED FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE ADVICE OF AN EARLY OPERATOR NOW THEY'VE ACQUIRED THE EARLY OPERATOR WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE THE INPUTS FROM THAT EARLY OPERATORS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE NEED A BETTER EXPLANATION OF THE BUSINESS MODEL THIS MAY SOUND STRANGE BUT THIS IS NOT A CONSTRUCTION WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS BUILDING A BUSINESS TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YET THE BUSINESS PLAN DOESN'T PROVIDE THE KIND OF STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION WE THINK SHOULD BE PROVIDED UP WHAT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT ACTUALLY ARRIVES WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT TO WHOM ARE WE NEED TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING DETAILED AGREEMENTS WITH THE BOOK AND OPERATORS IN THE FREIGHT REYES DESCEND SIMPLE IT IS ANYTHING BUT WHEN TWO OR THREE OPERATORS HAVE TO LIVE TOGETHER ON THE SAME PIECE OF TRACK ESPECIALLY FREIGHT AND COMMUTERS AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHO GETS WHAT PRIORITY WHO PAYS WHAT TO WHOM IT IS VERY CALM AND THESE OF THE DECISION SHOULD NOT BE LEFT TO LAST MINUTE THEY NEED TO DEVELOP WE NEED TO DEVELOP AND I PUT THE EMPHASIS ON WE A LONG RANGE PROGRAM FOR ADDRESSING GREAT CROSS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MORE SERVICES NOW GOING TO BE PROVIDED JOINTLY BETWEEN SAN JOSE AND GILROY AND AND THE OF BURBANK TO ANAHEIM AREA OF MORE AND MORE ENCOUNTERS ARE GONNA BE THERE BETWEEN AUTOMOBILES OR TRUCKS OR GAS TRUCKS AND HIGH SPEED TRAINS NOW THIS CAN'T BE SOLVED IMMEDIATELY AND THERE THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM JUST FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THEM PLUS COMMUTER RAILWAY SPLIT FREIGHT RAILWAYS PLUS THE HIGHWAY AUTHORITIES PLUS EVERYBODY INVOLVED BUT IT SHOULD START NOW AND CAL CALTRANS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO ASK THAT IT BEGAN WE NEED TO CLARIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM IS SHOWN IN TRIP TIME CALCULATIONS AND SCHEDULES OF I AM INFORMED THAT THEY ARE STILL TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF MEETING THE TWO HOUR FORTY MINUTE TRIP TIME BUT I THINK CONTINUING OF MY ATTENTION TO THAT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE EMPHASIS ON SHOWING PROJECTIONS AS RANGERS RATHER THAN POINT ESTIMATES IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AND TRACK BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO EXPAND THAT TO INCLUDE THE CAPITAL ESTIMATES AS WELL SO WE CAN BEGIN TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS KINDS OF OUTCOMES NOT ONLY THE EXPECTED OUTCOME BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT ALL GOES WRONG WE COULD HAVE THAT IF THIS WORK IS EXTENDED TO GIVE US THAT INFORMATION FINALLY WE THINK THEY NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER BACK UP PROCLAIM SURE BENEFITS URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR BUT THE BACKUP FOR WHAT HOW MUCH BUT IS IT WORTH WHAT WILL IT DO WELL WE HOPE THESE CAN BE ADDRESSED THESE MORE TECHNICAL POINTS CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE FINAL PLAN WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S IMMEDIATE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE FUNDING AND POLICY THANK YOU ENOUGH AND THESE ARE BIG QUESTIONS BUT IF I CAN HELP YOU ANSWERING THEM I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO TRY THANK YOU MISTER THOMPSON HER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE PANEL THE CRAFT SO MEMBERS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A VERY CLEAR -- OVERVIEW OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO IT AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO HAVE ONE OF THE LAST TWO POINT YOU'RE MAKING ABOUT TRIP TIMES YOU SAID I AM INFORMED THAT IT'S STILL TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE FOR THIS TO BE TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES AND THEN I THINK CLEARLY I THINK YOUR SUMMARY SAID ABOUT THREE HOURS INTENTIONALLY -- HOW MUCH SCRUTINY LIKE REAL SCRUTINY RIGOROUS SCRUTINY HAS THAT HAVE THE TRIP TIMES RECEIVED INDEPENDENT FROM ON HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS SAYING WILL HAPPEN WELL I'VE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH THEM THERE IS SOMETHING AND RAILWAY PARLANCE CALLED IT OUT TRAIN PERFORMANCE CALCULATORS COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT TAKES ALL OF THE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INTO ACCOUNT AND PREDICTS A TRIP TIME FOR THE TRAIN VAT OF I BELIEVE IS STILL SHOWING THE LESS THAN TWO OR AND THEN FORTY MINUTES FOR A TRAIN THAT STARTS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND DOESN'T STOP UNTIL IT GETS OF LOS ANGELES ARE THEY WILL NEVER SCHEDULE THAT TRAINS NOR WILL THE OPERATING SCHEDULE EVER SHOW THAT KIND OF TRIP TIME IT WILL BE MORE LIKE THREE HOURS THREE HOURS AND TEN MINUTES WHICH THEIR BUSINESS PLANS HAVE SHOWN FOR SCHEDULED TRAINS WITH THREE STOPS THAT'S NOT UNREASONABLE ARE IN THE DEMAND FORECASTING THAT THEY'VE DONE THIS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OUR POINT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY THAT THE DEMAND FORECASTING SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL SCHEDULE NOW WITH THE OPTIMUM POSSIBLE RUNTIME BUT OF THERE THERE IS AN ISSUE OF WHAT IS A LEGISLATION ACTUALLY REQUIRING IT APPEARS TECHNICALLY THAT IT REQUIRES THAT THE SYSTEM BE DESIGNED TO YIELD ON A TRAIN PERFORMANCE CALCULATOR TIME OF LESS THAN TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES AND TECHNICALLY THEY CAN DO THAT AND WITH THE AIR MARKS THAT YOU'RE MAKING WITHOUT ME THAT IN THE BACK I WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT IT'S IT WOULD HAVE TO TECHNICALLY BE DESIGNED TO DO THAT ALTHOUGH IT MAY NEVER DO THAT WHEN THAT IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT WILL NEVER KNOW YOU TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES NOT AS IT STANDS NOW OBVIOUSLY OVER TIME OTHER THINGS COULD BE DONE IF YOU WANTED TO BUILD UP A BRAND NEW TRACK OF FROM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE OVERT OR TO GIVE AWAY AND SEPARATED COMPLETELY AND SEVEN AT YEAH DOT COM COULD BE DONE OKAY WELL THEY TECHNICALLY COULD BE DONE IT HAS BEEN IS ARE NOT I WOULDN'T ARGUE THAT THEY NECESSARILY SHOULD I THINK THE THE THAT WHAT WE ARE CIRCLING IN ON MIGHT WELL BE THAT THE BEST ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM AND THE TRIP TIME POINTS AT I THINK YOU HAVE THIS IN YOUR REPORT AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HEAR THIS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS IT'S ONE OF THE CRITICISMS ABOUT CALLING AT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS YOU KNOW FOLKS FEEL LIKE FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN PAY ME TO FLY ON ANY GIVEN VERY CONVENIENT AIRLINE I WON'T PITCH ONE IN PARTICULAR HERE -- I GET FROM LA OR BURBANK TWO OAKLAND SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO FOR ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY IF NOT LAST FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND THAT TRAVEL ONLY GET MORE EFFICIENT AND CONVENIENT ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE OTHER ADVANCES THAT WE MAKE ON HOW YOU GET TO AN AIRPORT OTHER PARTS OF TRAVEL -- AND HAS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY EVER IN ANY OF ITS REPORTS AND I THINK IT DOES IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN TRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS FOR WHERE ELSE WE CAN PUT THOSE DOLLARS TO GET MOBILITY FASTER LIKE THAT ARE THE HELP OR THE AIRLINE OPTION OR OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE IN A NUMBER OF PLANTS MAKE CALCULATIONS OF HOW MANY LANES OF HIGHWAY CAN BE AVOIDED BY BUILDING HIGH SPEED RAIL HELP YOU KNOW BE AVOIDED BY INVESTING IN THIS WAY OF I DON'T THINK -- EXCEPT IN THE BROADER SENSE OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS ACOSTA I'M NOT SURE I'VE EVER SEEN A STUDY THAT SAYS WHAT THIS WOULD WOULD DO IN THE HEALTH AREA IF WE DIDN'T DO IT IN THE HOUSE IT REALLY WELL AND I THINK LEGISLATION LAST YEAR ACTUALLY PROHIBITS THE ABILITY OF US TO ADD MORE LANES YOU KNOW WHEN YOU PLACES IN ORDER TO RELIEVE CONGESTION SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THROUGH EUROPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COMPARE SOMETHING FAIRLY IT WILL HAVE VERY HIGH SPEED RAIL THE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NOW DECIDED IS A STATE THAT WERE NOT REALLY GONNA BE ABLE TO DO I'M NOT SURE THAT NOT IF THEY'RE COMPARISON IT IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS PRECISELY MY BROTHER WHAT I'VE SAID IS THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN BUILD MORE THE PAST AND CALL IT THE FUTURE WE JUST CAN'T DO THAT -- WE'VE WAS THERE IT WON'T WORK I THINK A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW I PERSONALLY BELIEVE PEOPLE WILL THANK US FOR DOING IT BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND YES THERE ARE HARD TRADE OFFS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE AND THAT'S HIM AGAIN GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND YOU MAY WELL WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASK US QUESTIONS WELL ABSOLUTELY AND AND THAT'S GOING TO MY NEXT ONE WHICH IS THERE'S OTHER THERE'S OTHER OPTIONS YOU LAY OUT IN AND SUMMARY OF WHAT IS IDENTIFIES POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT OPTIONS ONE IS STOPPING JUST STOPPING WHICH WHICH MANY CALIFORNIANS SAY PLEASE DON'T SPEND ANOTHER PENNY ON THIS BECAUSE I'D RATHER SEE THOSE DOLLARS GO INTO WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE A HIGHER INCREASE OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN MOBILITY IN ANOTHER GOOD IMPACTS AND YOU MENTIONED YOU DID NOT THINK THAT WAS APPROPRIATE SWEEP VOICES QUICKLY WE WOULD WE'LL BE STE LEFT WITH AN ASSET THAT CAN'T BE USED FOR ANYTHING THE THREAT THAT OKAY THIS SECOND OPTION YOU MENTION YOU THOUGHT WHICH IS THE PLEASE SOME OF THE LINE REALLY BE LEFT WITH THEIR THAT IS OF VALUE YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH BETTER SERVICE ON THE SAN JOAQUIN'S TO SOMEWHERE NEAR BAKERSFIELD YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH MUCH BETTER SERVICE IN THE CALTRAIN AREA YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH MUCH BETTER SERVICE OR SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ON THE SOUTH END -- INCLUDING THAT THE RESTAURANT MOST COURT MORE COURT I HAD SAME PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT WORK AND THREE CROSSINGS -- AND -- ME YOU WOULD HAVE YOU WOULD HAVE BETTER SERVICE AND WHEN IT LOOKS GOOD WITH IT WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IT TO DO JUST THAT NO YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA AND THAT'S OUR DECISION IS THAT WE WE YOUR POINT EARLIER ABOUT THE FUTURE AND USING THE PAST AND THE FUTURE OF IN THE REALITIES THIS IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS THAT I AM THINKING HUNDRED YEARS IF WE STOP THIS PROJECT BUT WE'VE DONE KUWAIT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MEGA REGIONS WE'VE INVESTED IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES WE MIGHT HAVE A GENERATION THANKING US FOR SPENDING THE DOLLARS THAT WAY AND NOT HAVING THE OPERATING COSTS THAT TAKE AWAY FROM TRANSPORTATION A END TO THIS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE DECISION WE WE HAVE TO MAKE WANT TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS THAT THERE'S FOR THAT ARE KIND OF SUMMARIZED A LITTLE BIT BUT WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BEYOND THE FOR THAT OR OR SAID ABOUT THEIR WORK OR WHAT POSSIBILITIES WOULD YOU SAY WE WANT TO BE SURE TO CONSIDER I KNOW THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AYE I SUPPOSE ONE OPTION WOULD BE PUTTING MORE MONEY IN CONVENTIONAL RAIL PASSENGER SERVICE AND MAYBE LASSEN HIGH SPEED FOR EXAMPLE A MUCH BETTER CONNECTION FROM SACRAMENTO OF BETTER SERVICE SERVICE SO WE HAVE A BETTER CONNECTION ON NAY FROM -- LA TO SAN DIEGO THINGS THAT WOULD NOT INVOLVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILES AN HOUR BUT WOULD INVOLVE BETTER SERVICE ON EXISTING CLIENTS WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF PASSENGERS ALREADY -- LIKE IT IT IN AND WHAT I REALLY HOPE WE CAN DO IS PROVOKE EXACTLY THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND THE LAST IS THE PRIVATE FUNDING -- OFF WE GET QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE'S THE PRIVATE FUNDING THAT THAT AT LEAST FOLKS FEEL LIKE THEY HEARD ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THIS WAS DEBATED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S WELL OFF INTO THE FUTURE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT BEING TRIGGERED AND COMING TO THE RESCUE THE FACT I THINK IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY AT SOME POINT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FORM OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM LET US NOT SUPPOSE YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU'RE RUNNING TRAINS AND YOU SHOW A LOT OF DEMAND AND A LOT OF PROFITABILITY AND THEN YOU SAY WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU OFFER ME AROUND MY SYSTEM FOR ME I THINK WE COULD WELL GET TO THAT BUT THE THE POINT WE WERE MAKING IS THAT GETTING TO THAT POINT REQUIRES AN AWFUL LOT OF INVESTMENT THAT WE RIGHT NOW HAVE GOT THE FOLLOWING THANK YOU THANK YOU CULTURE THE QUESTION TIME SO GO TO WASTE YOUR FOLLOWING THEM GO TO MR MATHIS I JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ATTILIO IN TERMS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS BEING MADE IN THE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN UP BUT YOU WOULD DO YOU DO YOU S. ASSESSOR AT IN YOUR ANALYSIS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REALISTIC COULD BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHICH ASSUMPTIONS HERE FOR INTO -- THEY THAT THE THE MODERNIZATION OF THE CAP AND TRADE THAT DEBT SERVICE ASSUMPTION THAT KEVIN TRAITS AND BIG SAID THE TWENTY FIFTY WE DON'T MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS PROJECT WORK BUT THEY DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A THOSE ARE REALISTIC I THINK I'M IN TERMS OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CAPTURED REVENUE ELECT ROSS SPEAK TO SPEAK TO THAT -- IN IN GENERAL THE AUTHORITIES PROPOSING A SET OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD MAKE THAT REVENUE STREAM FINANCE BOWL -- AND THOSE SECURITY REASONABLE TO TO OUR HOUSES -- IT WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A SILLY MUCH MORE OR MUCH LESS THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO SATISFIED HE DOESN'T COMMUNITY THAT MONEY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT PLATE INVESTMENT CREED IS AS THEY SAY I -- MINUTES FOR IS THE ASSUMPTION ON CAP AND TRADE INS ARE THE STEPS WOULD NEED TO BE TAKEN TO MAKE THAT SECURE I MEAN THOSE OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ACTIONS TAKEN BY A FUTURE LEGISLATURE AND SO THOSE ARE I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY SORT OF KNOW WHAT TYPES OF OPTIONS LEGISLATURE WILL TAKE BUT YOU KNOW THOSE YACHTS HOPEFUL TO KIND HOW THOSE OUTLINED IN KIND KNOW WHAT TYPES OF STEPS MIGHT NEED TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO COME TO MAKE THAT FUNDING -- MORE SECURE THAT CONTINUUM AND OF THE WAY THAT YOU SAID IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN SECURITIZED UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE AND WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE OUT YEARS AS WAS MENTIONED THE PROGRAM IS ONLY CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO TWENTY THIRTY SO ONE OF THOSE KEY ACTIONS WOULD BE -- EXTANT IN THE PROGRAM OUT TO TWENTY FIFTY -- BUT EVEN THE REVENUE OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY -- THE AUTHORITY I REFERENCE SOME OF OUR NUMBERS THAT WE PUT OUT IN A RECENT REPORTS WHICH PROVIDE SORT OF A LOS REVENUE SCENARIO IN HIGH REVENUE SCENARIO OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY -- I THINK NO COUPLE IMPORTANT POINTS ONE THOSE ARE ABSOLUTE BALANCE ON REVENUE I MEAN IT IS EVEN POSSIBLE IN CERTAIN YEARS THAT REVENUE WOULD DROP NO BELOW A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS IN A PARTICULAR YEAR OR IT COULD BE QUITE A BIT HIGHER THAN NO SIX SEVEN EIGHT BILLION THAT WE -- -- OUTLINED THIS SORT OF OUR HIGH REVENUE SCENARIO ON SUCH IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS MUCH DETAIL AS YOU WOULD LIKE ON -- ALL THE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT AFFECT CAP AND TRADE REVENUE UNCERTAINTY BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL NEW ARE A HIGH LEVEL YEAH YOU REVENUE DEPENDS ON ALLOWS CRISIS IN THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES SOLD AND THOSE FACTORS DEPEND ON THINGS LIKE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF REGULATORY DECISIONS -- THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS YET TO MAKE ON THINGS LIKE SURE -- NUMBER ALLOWANCES ARE GONNA BE ISSUED HOW MANY ARE GIVEN AWAY FOR FREE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE BUT LET ME CRYSTALLIZE I GUESS MY CONCERN MY QUESTION AND I I KNOW AS AS THE CHAIR INDICATED NO CAP AND TRADE AS THE PROGRAM AND FULLS OF THE REVENUES WILL REDUCE OVERTIME I GUESS AS AS HE HAS AS A CHAIR STIPULATED SO HOW I SEE IT IS WE HAVE AN UNCERTAIN FUNDING PLAN WHICH AND PAGE EIGHT YOU USE UNCERTAINTY A LOT AGAIN IN YOUR ANALYSIS AND THAT WE HAVE A VOLATILE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO YOU PLUG A LOT OF GAPS IN THIS TRAP PLAN IS THAT A CORRECT ASSESSMENT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION AND MY LAST QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE IF THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE IN THIS BUILDING ABOUT THAT IS THERE AN ANALYSIS DONE IN TERMS OF THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF SHOULD WE USE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS FOR THIS VERSUS OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING WHATEVER SO IF WE HAVE A A DELTA OF FIFTY TO SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS WE USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES MORE EFFECTIVELY IS THAT HOUSE IS BEING DONE OR CAN'T LA I DO THAT I THINK IT LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES MENACES AND YOU KNOW -- MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND IT AND IT DEPENDS -- YES OR YOUR MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDS ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOW THE ADMINISTRATION DOES PRODUCE A REPORT ANNUALLY WHERE THEY TRY TO ESTIMATE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND SO THERE'S SOME INFORMATION IN THERE AND THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS AN ESTIMATED COST PER TON OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE WE HAVE NO SOME ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE ESTIMATES BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION THERE BUT -- I THINK WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE ENCOURAGED THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY EVEN THEN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF THE REGULATION ITSELF CAP AND TRADE IS INTENDED TO HELP THE STATE MEET ITS GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS AND SO WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK BROADLY ABOUT HOW WE COULD USE THIS MONEY ON A VARIETY OF THINGS WHETHER IT BE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS LOCAL AIR POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS OR THINGS EVEN OUTSIDE OF THAT SCOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED A HIGH PRIORITY SO THINK ABOUT THAT WIDE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITY COSTS IS IMPORTANT ARGUE WHAT IF THE AND GET THE LEO COULD GET A SYSTEM THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT COURSE MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- NAY ARREST WHERE THIS I MEAN THE THE REVIEW THIS SUMMER YOU GUYS GIVES US GREAT -- WOULD IT WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS -- YOU GO THROUGH A LOT OF OPTIONS OF YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE THE MONEY WE CAN DO THIS OR IF WE HAVE THIS WE CAN DO THAT S. BUT I I'VE REALLY GOTTA ASK IN THIS IS THE QUESTION QUITE FRANKLY THAT I GAS AT HOME ALL THE TIME WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND PRIVATE FUNDING IS WHY AREN'T WE LOOKING TO PAY A HIGH TO PRIVATIZE THIS IN AND DO SOMETHING I MEAN WE WE HEAR ALL THE TIME AND ON FACEBOOK FEES AND EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT HOW THE AWESOME THINGS GUYS LIKE IAN MUSKER DOING AND I SCREWED UP GET ASKED ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS HOW COME WE ARE TALKING YA MUST TO PRIVATIZE THIS IN HERE PRIVATE DOLLARS TO DO THIS ON SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGIES MUCH FASTER AND IT STILL GIVES ARE ALL OF OUR GUYS THE JOBS IN THE BUILDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS STILL GIVES ALL OF THAT SOURCE LOOKING TO BUILD ON THE WORK FORCE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE THE JOB DEVELOPMENT GRAVEL THAT EVERYTHING WE'RE GETTING FROM I SCRAWLED ON ON THE JOB FRONT BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING A PRIVATE DOLLARS IN IN SOMEBODY WITH BETTER TECHNOLOGY QUITE FRANKLY I MEAN IT IT HE'S OF THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED ON A DAILY BASIS WHEN I'M HOME SO ON I'M ASKING YOU GUYS BUT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER TO THAT AND HOW COME IF IF WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE GETS HER WHY ISN'T THAT ONE SOMETHING THAT'S BEING EXPLORED IT THE ANSWER THAT I THINK IS THAT IF THEY WERE ONLY PRIVATE BENEFITS AND PRIVATE COSTS THEN WE COULD LET THE LINE TAKE CARE OF IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THERE ARE MANIFEST PUBLIC BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LIKE POLLUTION LIKE CONGESTION LIKE SAFETY LIKE OF NOISE LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL NOT PAY FOR AND WE CAN'T ASK THEM TO THERE ARE ALSO PUBLIC COSTS BECAUSE WHERE ELSE I HATE TO SOUND LIKE AN ECONOMIST I SWORE NEVER WOULD PUT BUT I'VE GOTTEN INTO THIS FROM TIME TO TIME THERE PUBLIC COSTS THAT ALSO NO PRIVATE ENTITY WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ONE WHERE THE OTHER THE QUESTION OF THESE KIND OF PROJECTS AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPE IS IS THE SOME OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BENEFITS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COSTS IN THE ONLY WAY TO TURN MEANT TO DETERMINE THAT ONE IS TO TRY TO PUT A NUMBER OR SOME VALUE ON WHAT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS ARE HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH US TO US TO ELIMINATE TWENTY GRADE CROSSING DEATHS A YEAR BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH IT TO US TO M. TO REDUCE CONGESTION OF BETWEEN -- SAN JOSE AND SAN FRANCISCO DILLON MUST CAN'T GENERATE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT ONLY THE PUBLIC SECTOR CAN DO THAT AND THE QUESTION IS IS THE COMBINATION OF PUBLIC MONEY AND PRIVATE MONEY EQUAL TO THE BENEFITS THAT WE BOTH TO RUNNING SENSORS ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT ONLY AT THE SECOND PHASE OF THIS ONCE YOU'VE GONE PAST THE POINT OF GETTING IN AND OUR OPERATION THEN YOU CAN SELL THE PRIVATE BENEFITS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS REMAIN IN ON THE PUBLIC SIDE AS THEY SHOULD LA AREAS HAVE ANYTHING READ RELATED OF I HEARD THEY HAVE YET EVEN LOOKED AT ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED ON THE STRAP BUSINESS PLAN I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE TO ADD TO IT LOU SAID BUT I JUST UNDERSCORES THAT THE DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T VISION ONCE THE IOWA'S OPERATIONAL SECURITIZED THOSE REVENUES AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN A FINANCING THE REST OF OF PHASE ONE A OF BRING THEM BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS THINKS THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE VOEPEL I WILL JUST ADD MR MATHIS THE QUESTION MUST WOULD HAVE TO ALSO ACQUIRE ALL RIGHT AWAY A PUBLIC PRIVATE YEAH STILL GOT ACCORDING TO WRITE I WHICH IS AN ONEROUS TASK AS WE CAN SEE JUDGE OF THIS TO THE ONLY TWO FOR THE ACTIONS ITEMS REQUESTED BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE A TO FINANCE CAP AND TRADE DOABLE AND WOULD REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE I THINK WE NEED TO DISCUSS WITH COUNSEL IN MORE DETAIL WHICH ITEMS WOULD REQUIRE GOOD PEOPLE BUT IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT SOME OF THEM MIGHT A GENERALLY SPEAKING THE ACTIONS THAT YOU FORTY IS REQUESTING THAT SEEM TO BE WILL BE NECESSARY TO NAY CAP AND TRADE REVENUES INVESTMENT GRADE GOOD QUESTION WOULD BE -- DOES THEY'LL THEY'LL HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT WOULD DIE OF BE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE OR THE MINISTRATION I'LL JUST USE SP ONE AS AN EXAMPLE CALTRANS NOW HAS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT IS PART OF THAT PROCESS WATCHING FOR THAT AGENCY -- WITH A SIX YEAR TERM DID YOU GUYS CONSIDER OF OTHER OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE -- PART OF WE CAN CONSIDER THAT QUESTION BUT WE COULD WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO CONSIDER AT ANSWERING THAT PERHAPS IN IN MORE DETAIL -- IT'S WORTH NOTING OF COURSE THAT ALSO WANTS NOT OF OF THE HAS YOUR AUTHORITY IN THE PROJECT AND THAT'S A POSITIVE STEP MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THAT ARTICLE BEGUN IN THE LATTER PART OF MAY I THINK IT'S A SEVERAL MONTH PROCESS BUT I NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT TO GIVE YOU CORRECT MISTRUST THANK YOU SO MUCH I WISH EVERY PROJECT HAD THIS ABILITY FOR THE DEDICATION YOUR COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN AND THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT IS ROUGHT AND THE AWARENESS. TO LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY. PHENOMENAL SUPPORT YOU'VE GIVEN US AND I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH WORKING MY STAFF AND SO SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOING FORWARD. OF. THE DRAFT PLAN CONTAINS RECOMMENDATIONS OF NEEDED ACTIONS FOR LEGISLATION TO TAKE. TO ENABLE THE AUTHORITY TO FIND HIS CAP AND TRADE FUNDS. WITH THESE ACTIONS BE SUFFICIENT TO BUILD THE SYSTEM. IN IS THIS THE BEST OPTION FOR FUNDING THE IOS. WELL FIRST OF SHIP THANK YOU FOR SAYING NICE THINGS HAD BEEN NOT SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION TO ME. COULD STILL PUT YOU ON THE SPOT THEM. I AND. I THINK. THE ANSWER IS NO IT WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO FINISH THIS THERE IS MORE THAT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU REALLY WANT TO REDEDICATE TO DOING FACE ONE AND FINISHING. THAT ONLY IF YOU WERE TO SAY. ALL OF THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY GOES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL AND. ONLY IF THE HIGHER END ESTIMATES WERE TO COME ABOUT. WHERE THAT WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO SUFFICE? OTHERWISE IT'S OTHER SOURCES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE FOUND NOT WRITTEN NOT NECESSARILY AFTER IT'S AN OPERATION BUT TO GET IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN OPERATE. WELL BASED ON THE DOES THE CURVE YOU GROUP BELIEVE THE FINANCING PLAN THAT WAS IS VIABLE. MARTIN DARLING I THINK MORE WILL NEED TO BE DONE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME TO GET US THERE. ESPECIALLY IF AS WE SAID YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR THE HIGH END OF THE ESTIMATES TO COME TRUE RATHER THAN THE THE MIDDLE OR THE OR THE MORE FAVORABLE NUMBERS. IT WILL BE THERE WILL BE MORE THAT WILL NEED TO BE DONE AND AND AND I I THINK. AGAIN IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD WITH PHASE ONE TYPE AMBITION. WE REALLY NEED THE PLAN FOR THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE NOT NOT THE MID PART OF THAT I'D LOVE TO HAVE IT TURN OUT BETTER BUT BUT I WOULD. ABSENT SAID I'M AN OPTIMIST AND MY HOPES BUT I'M A REALIST IN MY PLANTS AND IN THIS CASE I THINK REALISM WOULD SAY. PLAN FOR. COMPLETING IT IN UNDER ADVERSE OUTCOME. KRISTIN. SO DO YOU THINK THAT THE EARLY SERVICE ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY LINE OR THE SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY LINE MIGHT VIOLATE PROPOSITION ONE A. THERE IS NO SUBSIDY MANDATE. WELL I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION IT ISN'T CLEAR TO ME WHAT THE EARLY SERVICE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM SAN JOSE TO SAN FRANCISCO OR GILROY MIGHT ENTAIL I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY REALLY WOULD DO THAT. AND I CERTAINLY THINK THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS MONEY TO A CALTRANS PERFORMANCE WILL BE POSITIVE AND WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. WHAT WOULD THIS HURT THE SERVICE WOULD LOOK LIKE BETWEEN A AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AGAIN OTHER THAN TESTING I DON'T KNOW THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL? I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WOULD DO. I THINK THE INITIAL SERVICE WOULD BE TO ALLOW. AMTRAK TO USE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRACKS. HOWARD ST SAN JOAQUIN SWITCH RUBY A GOOD THING AND THAT WITH CONTRIBUTED PERFORMANCE THIS AND WORKING. WHETHER YOU WOULD HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS IN EFFECT COMPETING WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN'S. AT THE OUTSET I REALLY DON'T KNOW AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN WELL ENOUGH. DEFINED. SO. LA THOUGH IN AND MISTER THOMPSON WOULD YOU EVER HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IF THERE WAS. THE POSSIBILITY OF A REVENUE GENERATING COMPONENT OF HIGH SPEED FREIGHT. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO TO. ALL WHO MET. THE SYSTEM IN SOME KIND OF FUTURISTIC KIND OF CONCEPT. WERE OF SOME OF THE FOREIGN. COMPANIES THAT PERFORM. I SPEED RAIL I HAVE THAT THAT DYNAMIC. AN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGE OF GLASS TRUCK MILES TRAVELED. BICU MOBILITY THROUGHPUT BASED ON THIS. WOULD IT BE. ANOTHER OPTION IN YOUR VIEW POINT AS A VIABLE. SOURCE OF INCOME THAT MIGHT BE INTEGRATED NO. AND I REALLY DON'T THINK SO I THINK THE EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH SPEED. PASSENGER TRAINS OR A VERY SPECIAL BEAST. AND THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MARKET AND A DIFFERENT SET OF CUSTOMERS IN A DIFFERENT SET OF TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. EVERY TIME PASSENGER RAILROADS HAVE TRIED TO OPERATE FREIGHT SERVICES THEY'VE HAD TROUBLE. NOW HIGH PRIORITY PACKAGE SERVICE FEDERAL EXPRESS KIND OF STUFF YES BUT THAT THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. BUT ANY ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF THE. MOUSSA BUT I APPRECIATE THE GANDER. SO LAST QUESTION FOR ME OF. WISCONSIN. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS PROJECT STOPPED. WELL THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW WHAT STOPPED IF YOU STOPPED IT JUST STOPPED NOW YOU WE HAVE NOTHING OF VALUE LEFT IN THE VALLEY NOTHING REALLY TO USE. AND YOU'D HAVE TO PAY BACK FEDERAL MONEY BATS. APPARENTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF INSTEAD YOU SAID COMPLETE WHERE YOU'RE DOING AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND COMPLETE WHAT YOU'RE DOING ALL CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PLUS THE WORK ON THE SOUTH END. IT YOU WOULD NOT END UP WITH HIGH SPEED SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY REALLY OF OF MANY GREAT VALUE. ALL YOU WOULD HAVE MUCH ENHANCE CALTRAIN SERVICE. AND YOU WOULD HAVE AND DANCE SERVICE ON AND. ON THE GRADE CROSSING IN THE SOUTH. IN IN THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY BACK THE FEDERAL MONEY BECAUSE YOU WOULD AT LEAST COMPLETE COMPLETE SOMETHING OPERATIVE IN THIS WE'RE BATTLING AND THEN. THAT WOULD BE IT AS I UNDERSTAND. AND NOT ONLY THAT VALUE LOST BUT ALSO ALL OF THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED RESOURCES IT WOULD BE. IN THAT REGION. JUST AN ABSOLUTE. ECONOMIC DEVASTATION THAT WOULDN'T. HIM. AND THE IMPACT ON. THE ECONOMY. WOULD BE. THAT PART THAT'S DEPENDENT ON FINISHING THIS CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS WOULD BE WOULD BE HARMED YES. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. MET SOME EVER BAKER. I THINK YOU AND I. ON THAT FEDERAL MONEY. IF IT JUST STOPPED. IT DIDN'T MAKE MAYBE PUT THE OTHER RESOURCES INTO OTHER CONSTRUCTION IN MOBILITY PROJECTS IS. OR I SUPPOSE ONCE NOT SPENT IT ALL BUT THAT FEDERAL MONEY IT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM FOR GIVING THAT. LEGALLY THAT YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. THE ANSWER IS I DON'T AND IF WE DON'T COMPLETE CERTAIN EVERY EVERY CERTAIN MILESTONES BY. EARLY THE NEXT DECADE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DON'T HAVE TO IS THERE A TRIGGER THAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK FEDERAL MONEY ANYWAY HER AM I. NOT RIGHT ABOUT THAT. I THE ONLY TRIGGERING NEW OF WAS THAT THE MONEY HAD TO BE SPENT BEFORE SEPTEMBER THE THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OTHERWISE IT DIED. BUT I DON'T KNOW. EXPATRIATE IN THAT BED DATES CONTINGENT ON COMPLETING A USEFUL SECOND THAT BY TWENTY FOUR LITTLE SHIPMENT NO. I DON'T KNOW WHEN WHETHER THERE'S A DEADLINE AFTER COMPLETING MY I HAVE BEEN IN MY HEAD THAT'S WHY TO ME TOO. I THOUGHT IT WAS THAT THEY HAD SIGNIFICANT HAVE TO COMPLETE ALL DELIVER HAS REAL PEOPLE.

EXACTLY FOURTEEN NINE POINT SIX PERCENT OF THE STATE POPULATION. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT DISCUSSION TODAY I APPRECIATE. THE CEO OF HIGH SPEED RAIL MISTER KELLY. COMING IN AND BEING STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT. HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COSTS WHAT'S GONNA TAKE? JUST TO REMIND YOU ON NINETEEN AND TWENTY OF COMMITTEE BEFORE. THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH HIGH SPEED DATA STORAGE. TO INVEST THAT BILLION DOLLAR. AN IMPROVING. THE THIRD RAIL CROSSINGS. AND. OLD THE PROJECT THAT WOULD MAKE HIGH SPEED THEY'LL COME SMALLER REGION. AND THAT BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWELVE WAS NOT EXPECTED. THE TO BE WAITING UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT OF THAT SEVENTY SIX. MILLION OUT OF THE BILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED PLUS CON. NO CROSSING. I AM VERY PLEASED AND GRATEFUL TO THE HIGH SPEED THEIR US WHAT IF YOU FOR PUTTING IN THEIR DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO COME TO UNION STATION WHICH WILL BE. A WELCOME OF TODAY. IN NEWS FOR US. SO THAT BRINGS THE FIVE HUNDRED BILLION FROM ONE EIGHT. DOLLARS. THERE IS ANY MEANING COVER BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. TO IDENTIFY FROM OTHER SOURCES. TO INVEST IN THE CATO. I'M NOT HERE TO JUDGE. THE PROJECT I THINK YOU HERE'S ENOUGH ABOVE THE PROJECT ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS. NOT ONLY THAT THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOOK ENDS. THEY JUST SIGNED THE MORE YOU IT IS VERY CRITICAL FOR THE EXISTING. RAIL SERVICES IN THE FUTURE. WHEN I SPEED DETAIL. COMPLEMENT TO OUR REGION. SO I I COMMIT TO YOU TODAY THAT WE GET TO WORK WITH WITH YOU AND WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY THAT AS TO THE MONEY. AND DID HE IF THE HIGH SPEED HEALTH ON TELEVISION. REMINDING YOU THAT WHEN WE STARTED THIS DISCUSSION. LE FARE SEGMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND SOMETHING CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS. THAT MOVES NOTICED AND AND WE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE'S ON WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL ON. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR PERMIT CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THE FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. THAT SETS A PRESENT OR SOMETHING CALIFORNIA EXPECT. AND INVESTMENT IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM IN ANTICIPATION OF HIGH SPEED BILL. BUT BEING THERE AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE. PAGE WAS TURNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S A A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MY NAME IS JIM HART THAT I'M THE EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALTRAIN COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM. CALTRAIN APPLAUDS THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ON THE RELEASE OF THEIR CRAFT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. THANKS IN PART TO COMMITTED PARTNERSHIP AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT FROM THE AUTHORITY CALTRAIN HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROCEED WITH EFFORTS TO ELECTRIFY THE CALTRAIN QUARTER BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE. AND HAS SECURITY INVESTMENT NEEDED TO REPLACE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE SYSTEMS DIESEL FLEET. WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE ELECTRIC TRAINS. A PLEASED TO REPORT THE WE ARE PROJECT GROUNDBREAKING IN JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. DESTRUCTION HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR MONTHS AND THE FIRST POLLS HAVE BEEN SCRAWLED ALONG THE QUARTER. WE'RE ALSO PLEASED WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE HIGH PERFORMANCE ELECTRIC TRAINS OF WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN SALT LAKE CITY. AND SERVING WRITERS ARE QUARTER BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE DRAFT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN PROPOSES NEW STRATEGIES THAT WOULD EXPAND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CALTRAIN QUARTER SOUTH OF SAN JOSE TO GILROY. ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES CURRENTLY SERVED BY CALTRAIN WILL BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY ELECTRIC TRAINS. INCLUDING INCREASE SERVICE FREQUENCY REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES. ENHANCED RELIABILITY AND IMPROVED AIR QUALITY. THIS NEW APPROACH WHICH IS PART OF THE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SILICON VALLEY TO CENTRAL VALLEY LINE. IS A CONTINUATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE AUTHORITY OF LONG STANDING COMMITMENT TO EVENTUALLY CONNECT THE STATE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. IN A WAY THAT ALSO OFFERS IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING REGIONAL RAIL SERVICES. ACCORDING CALTRAIN. THE APPROACH ALSO FOCUSES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EARLY IN A ROOM HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND GILROY. AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THE ADDITION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE TO THE CALTRAIN QUARTER HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS OF COURT OR ELECTRIFICATION. AND PROVIDING COMMUNITIES ALONG THE QUARTER WITH NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT WILL BE A VALUABLE PART OF OUR EFFORTS AS A REGION TO ADDRESS GROWING TRAFFIC CONGESTION. AND MAINTAIN OUR ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. CALTRAIN IS CURRENTLY LEADING EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE CALTRAIN BUSINESS PLAN WHICH INCLUDES AN IN DEPTH TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES INCLUDES CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES. WITHIN THE CORRIDOR INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. CALTRAIN LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT FROM THE AUTHORITY ON OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO COMPLETE THE BUSINESS PLANET TO BETTER DEFINE STRATEGIES. FOR ENHANCE CONNECTION BETWEEN COMMUNITIES ON THE COURT OR IN FOR THE EVENTUAL CONNECTION OVER REGION TO THE REST OF THE STATE. CALTRAIN ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY IN OUR PARTNERS IN SAN FRANCISCO TO ENSURE THAT CALTRAIN AND HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICES ARE EXTENDED TO DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO'S TRANSBAY TRANSIT CENTER. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE EXTENSION OF HIGH QUALITY RAIL SERVICE THE TRANSBAY TRANSIT CENTER HOLDS DRAMATIC POTENTIAL FOR THE EXPANSION OF CALTRAIN SERVICE. TO NEW MARKETS WILL HELP FACILITATE CONGESTION RELIEF AND ENHANCE MOBILITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE QUARTER. SIMILARLY WE ARE EXCITED TO BE WORKING IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AUTHORITY THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. TO ENVISION A NEW DIRT ON STATION AYE IN SAN JOSE A PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE THE NEW REGIONAL STATE WHY CONNECTIVITY. AND TRANSFORM THE SOUTHERN TERMINAL OF OUR RAILROAD. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. Q. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF OUR PALS. WE GET TO GOOD. SO I HAVE A COUPLE. HASSAN WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THE OTHER PRIOR PRIORITY PROJECTS IN THE SACK SKEG REGION QUICKLY FUND BY THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PROMISED IN THE MOU. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER. OKAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE WERE SEVERAL PROJECTS WE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A LIST. FOR OVER FIFTY IF YOU PROJECTS. FROM A GRADE THE CROSSINGS TO EXPANDING THE THE RAILS IN SOME PLACES. SAFETY PROJECTS. THAT AND WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THAT SHORTAGE HERE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF US CRIED. GRANTED SOME OF THESE PROJECTS. I'M NOT REALLY FOR CONSTRUCTIONS. BUT NOW THE FACT THAT WE'RE USING THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF OTHER THAN PROP A. WE COULD WORK WITH US ON THE TEAM MUCH BETTER MUCH FASTER TO GET THIS PROJECT. WOULDN'T OUT OF IT GOT TO GROW. SO IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE COMMEMORATIONS THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED. MIL THAT AWFUL. OKAY. AND THEN. MR HARTNETT. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO IDENTIFY THE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BRING HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. TO FOR THINKING SAN FRANCISCO ONE ROLE CALTRAIN PLAY IN THE DEPLOYMENT PLANS. AND AGAIN ON TO THE TRANSMITTER YES I ACTUALLY. THERE'S A OF WE HAVE. LAID OUT A PROCESS FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON OF PLANNING THE SERVICE. FROM. OUR EXISTING FOR THINKING STATION TO THE TRANSBAY TERMINAL. WITH. LOOKING AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ALTERNATIVES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO COME TOGETHER ON A PLAN TO. BOTH CHOOSE THE RIGHT ALTERNATIVE AND HAVE THE APPROPRIATE STATION CAPACITY. TO. SUIT BOTH HIGH SPEED RAIL ON CALTRAIN NOT JUST FOR NOWBUT FOR THE FUTURE SO WE HAVE WE ARE WORKING VERY WELL TOGETHER AND THAT. CAN YOU. DETERMINE WHAT CAPACITY IT HER ADDITIONAL CAPACITY THIS WILL FORWARD. CALTRAIN ON RIDERSHIP. THIS BEING THE EXCEPTION TO DOWNTOWN. IT IT YEAH I. YOU DID IT SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES THE MARKET FOR US BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF WRITERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO TO DOWN. TOWN EXTENSION AS AS COMPARED TO STOP UNIT FOR THINKING. THERE IS A THERE'S A RANGE OF FIGURES. BUT. AYE RIGHT NOW WE SERVE ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION WRITERS YEAR. AND. I WOULD EXPECT. BY A THAT AS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THAT MERELY BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSION BUT WE HAVE PLANS TO ENHANCE THE CAPACITY FOR OTHER REASONS AS WELL SO WE WE EXPECT VERY. OF ROBUST. SYSTEM WORKING TOGETHER WITH HIGH SPEED ROLLER BLADED SERVICE. APPRECIATED. SEGWAYS INTO. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE CURRENT CALTRAIN SERVICE TO GILROY. HOW WOULD THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF ELECTRIFICATION GILROY AFFECT CALTRAIN? I THE PROPOSED AND THAT THE PROPOSED. ELECTRIFICATION I THINK WOULD PROVIDE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAPACITY INCREASE RIGHT NOW. THE THE RAIL SERVICE. USES SOLELY THE UP RIGHT AWAY. UNDER ATTRACTED YOU AGREEMENT THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT HAS. BE CAPPED LIMITED NUMBER OF TRAINS THAT CAN. RUN UP AND DOWN THE THE TRACKS. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE OF THE FUTURE. AND UNDER OUR CURRENT THAT ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT THE THERE IS NO FUNDING FOR ELECTRIFYING THAT THAT THE RAILWAY. SO. THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THIS IS IS OF TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO TO THE ENTIRE COURT OR. WELL I THINK IT HAS TO BE CAPTURED ALSO THERE WAS. BOOK IN MONEY FROM ONE EIGHT BUT THERE WAS ALSO SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR. COMMITMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THIS PROJECT ALSO YES THE. ACTUALLY THAT THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT INCLUDING OF BOTH OR ALL THE THE CIVIL SIDE OF IT IN THE PURCHASE AT THE ELECTRIC CARS IS JUST SHORT OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO THE. THE FUNDING FROM THE AUTHORITY. INCLUDES A SIX HUNDRED A BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS AND ANOTHER HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAVE OTHER SOURCES. AND WE HAVE. WITH THE GREAT SUPPORT OF THE STATE AND AND OTHERS OBTAINED AT SIX HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION. DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANT IN THE BALANCE OF THE MONEY IS FROM OF LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS REGIONAL ONE AND ANOTHER ABOUT COMMITMENTS. SO IT'S. DE DA HIKED THE AUTHORITY INVESTMENT IS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LEVERAGED. IN IN THE SELECT CATION PROPERTY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE ECONOMIC. VALUE OF THIS INVESTMENT WITH. TACK COMING INTO THE REGION HOW CONGESTED THE. THE THE. REGION IS RIGHT NOW FOR FOR ANY KIND OF MOBILITY GET TO WORK. AND. AND ANY KIND OF FREE DYNAMIC IS ACTUALLY STALLED IN THE WORLD ONE AND SO DID THIS INVESTMENT ACTUALLY BRINGS ANOTHER. VALUE. INTO THE AREA THROUGH THAT. WOULD LIVE ONE OF KIRK IT IT'S ABSOLUTELY. CRITICAL TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE IN THE REGION AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC VITALITY. THE THAT ENHANCE THE CAPACITY BETTER OPERATING CLEANER OPERATING. SYSTEM IS JUST KEY TO THE REGION. OF. ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS PROUD OF OUR SYSTEM WHEN IT FIRST STARTED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND I THINK I PROBABLY DIDN'T FORESEE BOB ELECTRIFICATION OF IT BUT. BUT HE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED A LITTLE BIT MORE A LITTLE QUICKER. AND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THIS MAKE THIS CHANGE TO TO BRING US UP TO THE. IT YOU KNOW BUT THAT THE QUALITY THAT REALLY. IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE CAPACITY NEEDS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. WELL. MR AT OUR. AND FOR ONLY A TO KNOW THAT AND INVESTMENT. IN THE BOOK ENDS. IS NOT POLITICALLY TAKE ALONG AND FROM SHIFTED WILL BUT IF YOU SAY IT'S AN ECONOMIC ISSUE IT WILL BRING BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. JET JUST REMINDING YOU THAT WE HAVE THE. THE LOSS AND CANADA. LOS ANGELES IN THE ABSENT FROM SAN DIEGO TO SAN LUIS OBISPO. THAT'S THE SECOND BUSIEST GUIDED OR AFTER THE NORTHEAST. AND THEN IN THIS MONTH THERE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL IMMEDIATELY. TO THE PEOPLE SUFFERING CAN BE FOR THE TO HALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. THEY ECONOMIC BENEFIT THESE DOCUMENTS IT WILL BE GREAT. TO INVEST IN THE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE TO JIM TALK ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN THE. ONE I THINK WE HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE. IMPENDING A. I'M NOT AFRAID FISCAL BECOMING INTO THAT REGION. WITH A NEW SUPER FREIGHTERS AND WHAT NOT NEARLY FROM THE EIGHT THOUSAND TWO YOU DO YOU USE TO TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO USE. AND THE ABILITY TO GET THAT. FREIGHT. PRODUCT MOVING. HOW WITH THESE GREAT SUBSTANCE SOME OF THE MOBILITY ISSUES THAT YOU YOU RUN ACROSS? IT'S IT'S A FOR PLANNING KIND OF INVESTMENT TO TRY TO CONTINUE. TO ENCOURAGE THAT THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY TO FLOURISH SO I GET EXECUTIVE I MISTER CHAIRMAN ONE THING. DETAILS. OF THE FAIRY TALE. AND THE PASSENGER RAIL USE THE SAME TAX RATE. AND THE KIND OF PROJECT THAT WE. WE PUT TOGETHER FOR THE BOOK AND INVESTMENT INCLUDE THOSE AGAIN CROSSINGS IN MANY AREAS WERE ABOLISHED THE FREIGHT. AND THE PASSENGER RAIL USES. AND AND LAKE YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIRMAN ONCE HERE THOUGH THE STATE'S JOBS THAT ACCURATE IN THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN LOS. MOVING FREIGHTS MOVING GOODS AROUND. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. MISTER BERMAN I THINK YOUR QUESTION. YET TO SCOOP WATCHING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A LOT OF TIME AND ATTENTION AND RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SPENT ON. GRADE SEPARATIONS AND. INK FOR ATTACK GRAY CROSSINGS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN GYM. THAT YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO TO MY DISTRICT INTO THE PENINSULA WHERE CALTRAIN CURRENTLY RUNS YOU KNOW FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND SCHOOLS THAT I WANT TO. AND BUSINESSES AND. THERE ALSO. YOU HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PERSONAL SAFETY ISSUES AROUND THE CALTRAIN CORRIDOR. IN THE PENINSULA CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL WHAT KIND OF. GOT COMMITMENTS THEY'RE MAKING TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE. IMPACTS THAT HIGH IF ICE HERO ORDER RUN. UP TO SAN FRANCISCO WOULD HAVE ON THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE A SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS AT THIS TIME THE THEIR. HIGH SPEED RAIL IS IS STILL GOING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS FOR THE. ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AT SAN FRANCISCO TO SAN JOSE. AND. I'M SURE THE GRADE SEPARATIONS ARE GOING TO BE. MENTION AND LOOKED AT AS PART OF THAT. YOU TO BE REALLY HONEST WE SUFFERED IN IN CALTRAIN FROM A LACK OF. THE ABILITY TO INVESTMENT GRADE SEPARATIONS SYSTEM CALTRAIN IS NOT. THEIR ORGANIZATION THAT RECEIVES A DEDICATED SOURCE OF TAX FUNDS WE ARE. FUNDED OVER SEVENTY PERCENT FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SIMPLY BAR FOR A BOX OF REVENUE. IN UNDER THE BALANCE COMES FROM OUR OR THREE COUNTY PARTNERS. AND WE HAVE NEVER HISTORICALLY HAD A GREAT SEPARATION PROGRAM. END SO WE RECOGNIZE IT IS IT'S NOT JUST A HIGH SPEED RAIL ISSUE IT'S A CALTRAIN ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE FOR THE COMMUNITIES. SAM UNTIL COUNTY. ITSELF FROM LOCAL FUND'S LEVERAGING OF OTHER FUNDS HAS. FUNDED A NUMBER OF GREAT SEPARATIONS WE HAVE ONE GOING ON NOW THAT'S LIKE JOINTLY FUNDED WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE SAN MATEO AREA. WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDS. AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHEN IT PASSED ITS THAT MEASURE BE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEENA SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY. AVAILABLE TOWARDS GRADE SEPARATIONS. SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS JUST WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK TOGETHER HOW BEST WE CAN ADDRESS THE GREAT SEPARATION ISSUE. IT IS NOT ANYONE ENTITIES. FULL RESPONSIBILITY TO TOTALLY AGREE APPRECIATE THAT AND IN LIEU WOULD MENTION THAT EARLIER HOW IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE. STATE. REGIONAL LOCAL EFFORT I KNOW A LOT OF CITY GOVERNMENTS THAT ON THE PENINSULA ARE TALKING THAT. PUTTING RESOURCES TOWARDS IT AS WELL THE SCOPE OF IT IS SO BIG THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVERYBODY. YOU KNOW COMING TO THE TABLE WITH SERIOUS RESOURCES. AND AND I I HOPE AND TRUST THAT A HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL MAKE THAT COMMITMENT WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST SO THAT THEY'RE. JUST SEEN ON OUR REGION. WE HAVE. FIVE COUNTIES OUT TO THE SIX. AND SIX OUT OF THE SEVERAL SOFTENED CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A DEDICATED SALES TAX OF TRANSPORTATION. SO I WANT PARTNERSHIP WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL OF THIS MONEY BECOMES AVAILABLE MEANS WE'RE GONNA MATCH THIS MONEY. AND HAVE A MULTIPLE BILLION THERE ARE LITTLE INVESTMENTS ENOUGH POLITICALLYEXHIBITION POP I THINK CAPACITY TO THE TAX. OF BEING GREEDY FOR HIGH SPEED DELIVERY. GOING THERE I THINK YOU FOR IT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SELF HELP COUNTIES IN IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILLING TO. BE PART OF THE PROCESS WE LOOK AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO LEVERAGE THE THESE FUNDS ON. ISSUES AS A PARTNER GOES A LONG WAYS I MEAN. WITH THERE WASN'T THIS COMMITMENT BY YOUR ORGANIZATION. AND THE SUFFOLK COUNTIES. PROBABLY NOT GONNA GET OUT OF OUT OF THE BOX JUST APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AND AND ALL OF YOUR MEMBERS TO BE PART OF THIS. A SOLUTION BECAUSE AGAIN IT WAS HIGHLY CONSTRAINED PROJECT. EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS SO THAT THE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION THOSE COMING TO UNION STATION THAT'S THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. ONE A FUNDS GONNA BE MATCHED BY MUCH MORE LOCAL AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO THE SAME. WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY WENT. I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT. ASSEMBLY BIGGER GIVEN THE QUESTIONS YOU. THINK YOU AYE. SO WHEN I UNDERSTAND A BIT BETTER. FROM EIGHT EAST BAY AREA SO JUST THROUGH THE BENEFITS TO THE GREATER BAY AREA FROM THE WORK THAT YOU'RE REFERRING PARA CALTRAIN CORD BUT. WHICH OF THOSE. ITEMS THAT YOU'VE LISTED FOR US HEAD HEIGHT HAD IF THE FUNDING COULD HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE IF HIGH SPEED RAIL WEREN'T. BUILT BUT FUNDING CAME THROUGH SOMEWHERE ELSE WOULD SAVE A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT YOU NEED JUST CAME AT THE STATE LEVEL A STATE TRANSPORTATION BY WHAT NAME YOUR FUNDING SOURCE THAT MAY HAVE COME FROM IT BUT. THERE'S NOTHING IN HIGH SPEED RAIL BEING BUILT ITSELF IT'S MAKING THESE BEGIN PROJECTS POSSIBLE IT'S JUST THAT IS A SOURCE OF FUNDING NOW THAT. THE LEGISLATURE MADE THAT THE CASE EARTH THEIR PROJECT THAT. IF WE DON'T BUILD HIGH SPEED RAIL THE BOOKENDS WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE. BUT FOR THE FUNDING. WELL BOB I GUESS. THE BEST WAY I COULD ANSWER THAT IS TO SAY THAT. IN THE CALTRAIN TO STRATEGIC PLANS BEGINNING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. ELECTRIFICATION. WAS A BIT PART OF THE STRATEGIC VISION VISION OF CALTRAIN SO THAT IT PREDATES. HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND SO THE OUT IN THE IN THE FUNDING POWER OVER UP WITHOUT THA THE FUNDING FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM THE AUTHORITY AND FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AND ALL OUR PARTNERS LOOKED AT. TOGETHER WE COULD NOT HAVE. UNDERTAKEN THE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT. BUT SINCE THE PERCENT SAID SINCE THE OUT. ADVENT OF OF HIGH SPEED RAIL WE WORK VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER AND NOT JUST BETWEEN. CALTRAIN AND HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATE. AND IN TERMS OF HOW WE BEST FIT IN. FOR THE. OVERALL STATE RAIL PLAN. AND SO. ALL OF THIS POWER PIECES% OF THAT. IN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A PIECE OF THAT AND CALTRAIN IS A OF THAT. TOGETHER UP WITH THE OTHER PIECES. REALLY COULD COMPRISE A WHOLE STATE RAIL PLANTS AT THAT THOSE ARE POLICY DECISIONS FOR. OTHERS THAN ME BUT WE WE ARE PART OF A LARGER POT PUZZLE THAT INCLUDES HIGH SPEED RAIL. IN THE OTHER WORLD SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE SAMPLING ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR SOMETHING CALIFORNIA THIS PROJECT EXISTED. WE THAT MEANS THEY WE WANT TO TO IMPROVE IN THE STATION. WE PRESCIENT THE PARTNERSHIP OF HIGH SPEED YET BUT I I WOULD SAY. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE HIGH SPEED THAT WE WOULD SO PROBABLY COME TO THIS COMMITTEE AND SAY. HOW BY THIS GOVERNMENT DID FUNDING VOTER OR THAT I THE FUNDING THE POINT IS THESE THESE PROJECTS ARE NEEDED? AND WHAT I WHAT PARTNERSHIP WAS AYE SPEEDOS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN WHICH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND. BEING PART OF OUR PANEL SO. IF YOU HAVE ANY LAST WORDS LIKE SAY BEFORE YOU. AT JUST AGAIN ONE I THINK HIGH SPEED RAIL AND MYSTICAL FOR BEING STRAIGHT FORWARD AND AND THE BUSINESS COMES UP WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT BIG AND THE BOOK ENDS AND AND WE WAITED. CHEERS AND WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER SIX ONE OF THE WOOD FROM WHAT. HOW WOULD YOU DO IT TOMORROW TO ASK? SO IT IS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. SO WERE GONNA GO AHEAD NOW AND MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WE NEED THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE. ON FOR OR AGAINST. THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN PLEASE WHAT I'LL ASK. IS THAT YOU STATE YOUR NAME REPRESENT. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT AT A. REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME PLEASE AND. SIR STAGE NAME UNCLEAR RIGHT HERE MY NAME IS TED HEART. I'M SPEAKING AS THE VOTER AND AS A CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH A HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR TEN YEARS. AND APPRECIATE. WHAT THIS PANEL AND WHAT THIS HEARING HAS DONE IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN TEN YEARS? THAT I'VE HEARD REALLY PERTINENT QUESTIONS ASKED OF THE AUTHORITY UP UNTIL NOW. THAT HAS NOT EXISTED. BECAUSE I'VE ATTENDED ALMOST EVERYONE OF THE BOARD MEETINGS AT SARAH BUT I'D LIKE TO CALL TO YOUR ATTENTION IS WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING TODAY FROM. ALL OF THIS. AND THAT IS. THE VOTER. THE VOTER HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE US IN THE SENSE. THAT IN PROP ONE A AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS WERE TOLD. THAT. FOR TEN BILLION DOLLARS THEY WERE GOING TO GET A FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE'RE TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE YOU MENTIONED IT BEFORE. EXCEPT THAT THE FUN THE ACTUAL NUMBER. IF YOU TAKE THE NINETY EIGHT BILLION. AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE THAT MOVE IT FORWARD YOU'RE LOOKING AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION. SO THE FORTY FIVE BILLION HAS GONE UP THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THE QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS IS. WHAT ABOUT THE VOTERS IN SAN DIEGO? RIVERSIDE AND SACRAMENTO IN THE INLAND VALLEY AND ALL OF THESE PLACES WHO ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THIS. AND THE DISCUSSION TODAY. IT'S LIKE IT DOESN'T EXIST. THESE VOTERS ARE BEING LEFT OUT COMPLETELY. THE LAST COMMENT I WOULD MAKE. IS I JUST WANT TO THROW IT IN THERE THE QUESTION WAS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE STOP IT. WELL AFTER SIXTY YEARS IN THE COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BAD INVESTMENT. YOU STOP YOU DON'T THROW. GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD THANK YOU. DID YOU NAME YOUR REPRESENTING SIR YES MY NAME IS ALICE GOT ON WITH. SINCE MY CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO SPEAKING AS A TAXPAYER AND OF THE CITIZEN. AS FAR AS THE PROJECT IS CONCERNED I THANK YOU TODAY FOR WHICH YOU DON. ENLIGHTENING OF AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MEETINGS OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. AND THIS IS THE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES THAT REALLY HIT THE POINTS THE MAIL ON THE HEAD. WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS MEETING AS LIKE A PAIR KNOW SOMEONE'S HAND AMEND IF I COULD FOR THE RECORD? BUT I TOOK AWAY AS. THERE'S NO PLAN. WHAT I TOOK AWAY AS THERE'S NO MONEY? AND TO MISTER HART POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS I LEARNED WHEN I WENT IN THE BUSINESS AFTER A TRIED FROM THE NAVY VERY SIMPLY WAS THIS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO WORK FOR MY COMPANY YOU BETTER MAKE ME MONEY. AND YOUR NOT MAKE ANY MONEY WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET RID OF IT. AND TO ME THAT DEEP AND HAS TO STOP. SOME ONYX. CUT TO THE CHASE. AS THERE'S BEEN SAID ALREADY MISSED GERMANS PROJECTS LIFELESS CRITICAL LIFE THREATENING CROSSROADS FURTHERMORE. YOUR CONCERNS FOR THE RECORD I DIDN'T WELL STATED AND TODAY I APPRECIATE AGAIN WHAT YOU DON. WITHOUT QUESTION THE TAXPAYERS HAVE THAT THAT DIDN'T THE MOST ALL HAVE THE MOST ONEROUS TAX OBLIGATION UNITED STATES. PROBABLY EVEN IN THE WORLD FOR CALIFORNIA WE ARE TAXED TO. THE NTH DEGREE. ADDITIONAL I BELIEVE EVERYONE IN THIS DIAZ BELIEVES AND KNOWS THAT THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER VIABLE I DON'T THINK IT'S VIABLE ANYMORE EVEN HARDLY HEARD OF TODAY. KEY POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE ENTIRE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH. OF THIS CAN OF THIS STATE ARE STEWARDS OF OUR BANK. PLEASE ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ONE HUNDRED AND TEN PERCENT. AND THAT IS WHAT THE TAXPAYERS EXPECT OUT OF YOU THAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE LIKE TO CLOSE WITH THIS. DOWN IN SOUTHERN. DOWN IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. IT'LL TOWN SOUTH OF HILL AYE KINGS CAN'T. SOUTHERN KINGS COUNTY. THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE PLAN TAKING IT SHOULD THE SERIOUS COMPOUND THE HOUSE WAS CLOSED UP. SOME. TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO. AND I DROVE BY THERE. ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO THE HOUSE IS NOW OCCUPIED. I CALLED. SOMEBODY DOWN THERE THAT IF OF KNOWLEDGE. ESTAMOS GOING HE SAID WELL THEY DON'T LONG THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THE HOUSE. PEOPLE LIVE IN THAT HOUSE THE GENTLEMAN THAT BUILT THAT HOUSE. HIS WIFE. DESPITE. HE BUILT THE HOUSE FOR HER WITH HIS OWN HANDS. THREE YEARS TO BUILD A HOUSE. A COUPLE YEARS LATER THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SAYS A COMMON THREAD. I GOT PAST THEIR. BUT THE LAST MONTH. HOUSE IS WIDE OPEN. BRENDA WINDOWS. HOUSES BIT LIVING AND BEING RENTED. TUNISIA ONE. BEING RENTED. AND. WHY? MY QUESTION THAT TO ME IS ONEROUS. SURPLUS KRISTIN PRIMARY REPRESENT I'M BILL TO CARRY RESIDENT BAKERSFIELD MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND REPRESENTS PLAINTIFF FORTY FINALLY ADMITTED IT IS NUMEROUS MADE NUMEROUS COSTLIER IS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HOWEVER LIKE PREVIOUS BUSINESS PLANS THERE IS STILL A LOT OF HYPE AND HOPE. A HUGE IN MISSION IS THE FUNDING GAP CONNECTING SILICON VALLEY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENTS NEW TEMPLATE TO FUNDING GAP. YOU THIRTY AGAIN FEELS TOO FAILS OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WILL NOT INVEST IN THIS RISKY PROJECT WITHOUT GUARANTEES. NATIONALLY THERE STIFF COMPETITION FOR LIMITED FEDERAL MONEY FOR EXAMPLE AMTRAK IS SEEKING NINE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR SALTY'S CORRIDOR. MODERNIZATION. THE AUTHORITY HOPES TO MONETIZE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE BY ISSUING STATE OF CALIFORNIA REVENUE BONDS. REQUIRING A CREDIT ENHANCEMENT OR GUARANTEED BY THE STATE BECOMES A BOND HOLDERS FOR THE UNCERTAINTY OF CAP AND TRADE. OF RECEIPT OBVIOUSLY SEGMENT SOUTH OF BAKERSFIELD TO COMPLETE PHASE ONE REMAIN UNFUNDED. THE AUTHORITY CONTINUING ADMITS. OUR TOUTS ITS TRANSPARENCY YET AN EXHIBIT TWO POINT ONE IT SHOWS TUNNELS BETWEEN YOUR IN MADERA. BUT OMITS THE TUNNELS BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD IN PALMDALE AND THE TUNNELS BETWEEN PALMDALE IN BURBANK. TUNNELS VERY HUGE UNKNOWN COST. IN THE PLAN RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON TRAVEL BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND SAN FRANCISCO. IN REALITY TRAVEL WILL BE BETWEEN CHAPTER OR POSSIBLY BAKERSFIELD AND MADERA IN BETWEEN GILROY IN FULL FORCE AND KING STREETS IN SAN FRANCISCO. LACK OF FUNDING WILL LIKELY MAKE PEACE TWO SCENARIOS LONG LASTING. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL STATE SUBSIDY TO MAINE TO. A SUSTAIN OPERATIONS RIDERSHIP REVENUE FORECAST FOR THESE TWO SEGMENTS IS ESSENTIAL. IT IS CLAIMED CENTRAL VALLEY STATEMENT COULD BE USED BY AMTRAK. BUT WITH CURRENT AMTRAK STATIONS GONE FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ALIGNMENT. IT WOULD BE A HARDSHIP FOR CENTRAL VALLEY WRITERS. LASTLY WHILE MORE REVEALING THAN PRIOR PLAN I'M FLABBERGASTED ONE ON PAGE NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN. YOUR THORNY INDICATE SERVICE DECISIONS WOMAN SHORTFALL COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A. THE CURRENT PROJECT IS FAR FROM WHEN VOTERS NARROWLY APPROVED TEN YEARS AGO. IN CONCLUSION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE NOT SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS RISKY PROJECT AND HALTED UNTIL ENVIRONMENTAL WORK IS COMPLETED. AND TUNNELING COSTS OF DEVELOPING A RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCES ARE IDENTIFIED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MA'AM WHICH SAY YOUR NAME WHO REPRESENT PLEASE. YES ON IT IS AND GENTLEMAN MY NAME IS ME THERE RIGHT AND I'M THE OWNER OF A REALLY COOL GROUP INC. A SMALL WOMAN OWNED AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE FROM ROSEVILLE CALIFORNIA. MY COMPANY PROVIDES PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CIVIL ENGINEERING SERVICES TO BOTH. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR CLIENTS. WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. BUT I HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF THIS PROJECT LONG BEFORE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON IT. BECAUSE AND I'M HERE TODAY TIGHTLY TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT ONCE THEY GAIN FOR THIS PROJECT WHICH I THINK IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE. AND I'M DOING THAT BOTH OF THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND THEIR RESIDENT FOR CALIFORNIA VOTE. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AYE I'M VICIOUS UNDERTAKING IN OUR STATE RIGHT NOW. AND IT REQUIRES THE SUPPORT OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS AS WELL AS ALL OF FOR LEGISLATORS ALL LEVEL. TO BECOME A SUCCESS. THERE'S NO NEED TOREPEAT THEIR OF THE BENEFITS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECTS I'M SURE GO HER DIED. ITSELF MODERNIZE THOSE OR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS CREATING JOBS BUT I'M COMPELLED TO POINT KNOW WHAT GOVERNOR BROWN SAID THAT THIS PROJECT HAS CREATED TAUZIN'S OF THOUSANDS OF. HIGH PAYING JOBS FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE RIVER VETERANS WHICH I ALSO I'M VERY MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH IT. UP WE KNOW THAT MANY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF THE PROJECT DELAYS BUT I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS A MONTHS I'M A CIVIL ENGINEER. AND I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SEVERAL MEGA PROJECTS I DON'T THINK THIS PROJECT IS ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER MEGA PROJECTS. THAT HAVE HAD TO OVERCOME A POSITIONS FUNDING ISSUES. AND SO. YOU CONCLUSIONS. I MUST BE OR LEGISLATORS WHO PUT THEIR FULL SUPPORT BEHIND THIS PROJECT BECAUSE I THINK WOULD YOUR SUPPORT. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL MAKE THIS PROJECT A SUCCESS AND A REALITY FOR A STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK. THANK YOU SIR PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ROLAND LEBRON EARLY BE ARE YOU AND I HAVE NO AFFILIATION. OUTROS FROM SAN JOSE THIS MORNING TO GIVE YOU A FIFTH OPTION. WHICH IS HOW WE COULD CONNECT SILICON VALLEY TO FRESNO. WITHOUT HAVING TO AMEND THE EXISTING TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING ENVELOPE NOT TWENTY EIGHT. THE BULLS ARE CLEAR. THE MAJORITY OF VOTERS APPROVED ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE ANAHEIM IN THE SOUTH. AND DEROY ES AND FRANCISCO INTO NOT. PROBLEMS ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. PRIMARILY PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE EXISTING ALIGNMENT. IS IMPACTING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. DUBBED APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED HIGH SPEED LINE WILL DELIBERATELY AVOID THAT'S WAY TO COST NOT SWAYED IMPACTS ARE COMING FROM. SO BRIEFLY INCLUDE ENCLOSING. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION? FIRST WE NEED TO HIT THE POST BUTTON AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SECONDS WE NEED TO REVISIT BUT NOTE SAY NOT PACHECO PASS. IF YOU DO DAYS WE WE REDISCOVER AND ALIGNMENT THAT NOT ONLY SHE'S TEN MINUTES TRAVEL TIME. BUT THEY'D ALSO ELIMINATES APPROACH HIM ACTS APPROXIMATELY TEN MILES OF TUNNELS. AND IF YOU DO THIS. BECAUSE OF THE EXISTING A FREIGHT LINES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE LYMAN. IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SHEA AND A TON OF SWISS FREIGHT WITHOUT IMPACTING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAFFIC THANK YOU.

TO HELP MEET OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITH THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR SYSTEM REALLY TAKING CARS OFF OF THE LANES WERE HAVE LESS POLLUTERS REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT.

TO HAVE A VERY HIGH STANDARD WITH REGARDS TURN BERMAN WE SUPPORT THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORITY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND BUILD THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU. SHAMELESSLY RIPS UP MISTER CHAIRMAN RECESSED IDEAS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. OF ALSO ACOLYTE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY SAID ON BUT ALSO NOTE THAT A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN CONSTRUCTION WORK REPRESENT IS WE'RE HERE IN THE ROOM. LISTENING TO THE DEBATE AND THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED WE HAVE TO LEAVE. BUT IT ISN'T LIVES OR DUTY AND THEN ALSO TRANSPORTATION. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE EMBODIED HERE IN THE WORK THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE WITHIN THIS PROJECT. IN GOING A STEP BEYOND THE PROJECT CARRIES A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THAT ONLY HELPS OUT. IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS WHICH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS AND WHICH OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE BUT ALSO IN ASSISTING. A LOT OF THE SMALL MINORITY CONTRACTORS THAT AREN'T ACTUALLY ABLE TO BID ON TOUCH HOW THE PROJECT BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEXITY. WITHOUT PROJECT LIVER THAT LABOR AGREEMENT AND WHAT THAT FLEXIBILITY IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND OUR CONTRACTORS THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT DIVERSE CITY. SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THAT WERE STATED BEFORE WE STRONG SUPPORTERS BUSINESS PLAN WE THINK IT CARRIES A LOT OF FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. WE SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF CARRYING FORWARD BUT WE THINK THIS PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD ONGOING GET MORE MONEY FOR THE PROJECT. WE BELIEVE THE REPUBLICANS CANDID AND TO HAVE A LOT OF POINTS TO MAKE BUT THEY SHOULD GET REALLY GET BEHIND BECAUSE IT IT IS THERE ARE AREAS THAT ARE BENEFITING MORE SO GREAT LEAVES THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THEY'RE ACTUALLY HAVING THAT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN THAT BENEFIT TO WE THINK. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. TODAY. BUT THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. SEEING NONE. SO. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE PANELISTS IN THE PUBLIC FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S. HEARING BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY STAFF. WHO ARE VERY SHORT NOTICE AFTER THE DRAFT PLAN WAS PUT OUT THE WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE THIS HEARING? AND BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT GOT THE TEAM HERE WORKING WEEKENDS AND NIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF OF WITH A REAL REGULAR DUTIES. HEARING BILLS. AND SO. KUDOS TO MY STAFF AND I CAN'T THANK THEM ENOUGH. IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS. AHEAD OF US ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL. I AM COMMITTED TO CONSIDERING ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS HAS SO THAT WE MAKE THE BEST. DECISION FOR CALIFORNIA. NO WE CAN'T YOU CAN ATTRIBUTE THIS. EXTRA COST TO LABOR. THERE WAS DOORS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. IN ITS EXUBERANCE. THIS JOB IS I SAID. MOVE FORWARD. WITHOUT ALL THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE IN PLACE. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT. AND NOW WITH THE NEW. UPPER MANAGEMENT TO TAKE. THE THE. THE RAINS. WE'RE HOPING THAT PAST MISTAKES. CAN BE. AVOIDED. WHO ON FORWARD? THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THESE CEMETERY Ó SAN JOSE SAN FRANCISCO COURT OR. HOME. BUT WE HAVE TO BE REASONABLE HAVE TAP HAS TO BE ABLE TO BE OF VALUE TO THE PEOPLE. AND RECOGNIZE OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT PASSED TO BRING SOMETHING BACK. THE. WHOLE COMPONENT OF THE FUTURE GHG REDUCTIONS BECAUSE THIS PROJECT BUT WE'RE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING. WHY DID THE TOUR WHICH WAS TOUTED AT ALL OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A COMMITMENT IS BEING UTILIZED? WHEN I WAS THERE. WAS EITHER VERY LOW EMISSIONS ARE KNOWN MISSION. EQUIPMENT WHICH WAS. I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES IT'S BEEN DONE OR ACCOMPLISHED OR PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE. SO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I'M I'M? ADAMANT THAT WE GO FORWARD. WITH A PROCESS. ACTUALLY. HAS MORE OVERSIGHT. MAKE THE TRANSPORTATION OR THE. THE AUTHORITY HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY MORE. ACCOUNTABLE FOR DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. HOW GOING FORWARD? HA AND AND. THE PUBLIC SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER. THIS WAS NOT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN'S HIGH SPEED RAIL. REPUBLICAN TWO THOUSAND A VOTED FOR THIS PROJECT. BE IT ALL THEY MAKE IT HAS EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING ELSE YES AT HOUSE BECAUSE WHO COULD ANTICIPATE. WE THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT HOW ENORMOUS. THE TASK WOULD BE. OTHER COUNTRIES OF DONNA BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS WE DO. WE ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF OR HER ARE. OUR LAND AND DON'T MAKE RASH DECISIONS THAT MIGHT HURT THE ENVIRONMENT. I LIKE TO REMIND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PUBLIC THAT THIS IS A DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. SO MAY DRAFT IS NOT CAST IN STONE. COULD YOU HAVE FURTHER COMMENTS. BE SURE SUBMIT THEM TO THE AUTHORITY SALUTE COMMENTS CAN BE CONSIDERED IN THE FINAL PLAN. EVERYTHING. IS A WORKING DOCUMENT CONSTRUCTION I SPENT THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PROJECT THAT DIDN'T EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING ELSE OR. HE HAD TO ADAPT. I THINK THROUGH THE ABILITY TO. ADAPT AND MAKE THINGS WORK IS WHAT WE NEED. ON PROJECTS LIKE THIS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO. A BETTER DEFINITION OF A BETTER OF OF HOW. FINANCING WILL BE DONE. I DON'T WANT TO. UTILIZED JUST CAP AND TRADE AS THE CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR THIS I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK MORE INTO. PRIVATE INVESTMENT. NOW MY NAME BEFORE COUNTRIES. TO BE ABLE TO INVEST INTO THIS PROJECT. WITH THE. UNDERSTANDING THAT NUMBER ONE LABOR COMES FIRST. OUR JOBS ARE IMPORTANT TO US AND THEN YOU. LOOK AT. MAYBE ARE OF VALUE MAKE AN INVESTMENT INTO CALIFORNIA ALSO. SO I LOOKING FORWARD AGAIN TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS DONE RIGHT THE AUDIT WHEN IT COMES OUT. LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TO DISSECTING IT WITH MY STAFF. AND. BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU EVERY TIME THAT I'VE BEEN. IN THE THE THE PRESENCE OF THAT PROJECT. THE DATA DAY OPERATIONS ARE BEING HANDLED ON IT A VERY EFFICIENT MANNER AND YOU'RE GETTING. IN THAT ASPECT OF VALUE THE TAXPAYERS ACTUALLY GETTING ABOUT. HOME BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST. GENERATIONS. SO THIS WILL COMMENCE THE HEARING. OF HIGH SPEED RAIL CRAFTS VISIT BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING FORWARD SO THANK YOU SO MUCH
