00:34:39.076 --> 00:34:40.178
KNOW IS A LOOK AT THE THE

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:43.014
LEGISLATION AND THE HISTORY OVER --

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.449
SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY WHEN WE

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:46.117
STARTED WITH LICENSE PLATE

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:47.852
READERS AND THEN WE THE NEXT

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.821
YEAR WE ALL OF SUDDEN DISCOVERED

00:34:49.887 --> 00:34:50.721
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.457
USING THE CELLULAR INTERCEPTED

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:54.926
VICES IN LOCATIONS THAT UP.

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:57.195
AND IN A MANNER THAT --

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.163
WASBASICALLY FOR A FREE FOR ALL

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.765
CIRCUMSTANCE ROUTE WITH NO

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:03.568
CONTROLS OVER IT AND EVEN ONE

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.236
CITY WAS USING IT DIDN'T FLY

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:05.536
[inaudible]

00:35:05.603 --> 00:35:07.872
THAT A CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:08.906
FACED WITH IS THAT THE

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.242
TECHNOLOGY IS IS DEVELOPING SO

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.044
RAPIDLY THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.713
US TO CONTINUOUSLY CONTINUALLY.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.382
WAIT UNTIL WE GET SITE OF

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.017
UNDERSTAND HER SHE OR SOMEONE

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:22.420
EXPOSES A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY --

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:23.654
AND THEN WE HAVE TO DO

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.057
LEGISLATION THIS COVERS ALL OF

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:27.758
THE LEGISLATION OR ALL OF THAT.

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.894
ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT IS

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.462
PRESENTED AND THAT NEW

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.331
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S PRESENTED --

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:34.765
WHAT WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY IS

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:36.267
IT DOESN'T?

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:38.402
PROJECT PRECLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.037
FROM CATCHING THE BAD GUYS ARE

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.973
CRIMINALS JUST FOR THE FACT OF

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:42.940
HAVING IT OR THAT THE PUBLIC

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.342
KNOWS IT THEY KNOW WE DO

00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:45.576
WIRETAPS TODAY.

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.911
THEY STILL TALK ON THE PHONE AND

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:47.545
SAY THE SAME THINGS THAT THEY

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.080
SHOULDN'T THEY KNOW WE HAVE

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.081
LICENSE PLATE READERS IT PEOPLE

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:51.315
STILL STEAL CARS.

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:52.717
AND DRIVE AROUND IN THOSE CARS

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.785
AND GET PICKED UP FROM THEM --

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:57.221
THIS IS COMMON TECHNOLOGY THAT --

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:58.556
FROM ONE JURISDICTION TO THE

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:01.025
NEXT ISN'T SPECIFIC TO THAT

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:03.194
JURISDICTION FROM UP PERSPECTIVE

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:05.429
OF A OF A CRIMINAL AND THEY KNOW

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:07.365
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:09.233
THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IN THEY USE

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.635
THAT TECHNIQUE THAT THE LAW

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.203
ENFORCEMENT USES THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.571
I BELIEVE WITHOUT ANY

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.172
RESTRICTION TODAY AND AND IT'S

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.407
VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE WANT TO

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:18.142
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.911
THAT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:20.878
AND THAT'S THAT BUT TO ME THE

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.346
MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT THE

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:24.549

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.284
CIVILIAN BODY MAKES THOSE

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.319
DECISIONS AND UNDERSTANDS IN A

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.421
PUBLIC FORUM WHAT TYPE OF

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.156
EQUIPMENT IS BEING USED THEIR

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:33.190

CORCORAN AND I AND AND I'M.

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.203
WANNA MOVE THIS OUT SO WE CAN

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.371
KEEP THIS GOING I THINK --

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:50.408
TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY IMPORTANT --

00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:53.077
IF YOU CAN WORK WITH.

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.211
THE COURT HOPEFULLY THAT THIS

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:56.981
BILL GETS OUT. TO TO TO ADDRESS

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:57.915
HIS CLAIM.

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.183
ARM BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION

00:36:59.250 --> 00:36:59.483
[inaudible]

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.588
KIND OF TWO THINGS OF BECAUSE OF

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:04.121
HER JUST HAVE HEARD JUST A

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.856
SECOND TIME.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.425
ON THIS QUESTION.

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:09.427
OF AUTHORITY.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:11.195
OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:11.495
[inaudible]

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.464
OVER --

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:15.566
LAFORTUNE.

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.801
BOB NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:20.838
RIGHT. TO DO THAT IS OUR

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:23.307
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY --

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.509
SHERIFF COULD NOT FUND THEM

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.111
SELVES THIS YET NEARLY DONE BY

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:28.512
THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WE DO THAT

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:29.714
WITH CHP.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.682
DO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.751
WE DO THAT ON A LOCAL LEVEL

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.820
BOAST THAT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:38.456
THE AND THE CITY LEVEL.

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.458
AND IN FACT --

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:41.792
DIFFICULT DEPARTMENTS CAN'T BE

THANK YOU MAY BEGIN SIR --

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.886
YES SENATOR BRADFORD DESCRIBE

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:24.721
CALIFORNIA SENTENCING AS ONE OF

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:26.323
THE MOST COMPLEX IN THE NATION I

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.624
THINK THAT KIND OF UNDER CELLS A

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:29.059
LITTLE BIT --

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:30.727
I TOOK AN INFORMAL POLL OF MY

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.396
COLLEAGUES AT THE UC BERKELEY

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.730
SCHOOL OF LAW.

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.699
AND THE CONSENSUS IS THAT

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.501
CALIFORNIA'S SENTENCING SCHEME

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:40.437
IS BY A GOOD MEASURE THE MOST

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:41.405
COMPLEX IN THE NATION.

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:43.373
AND THAT'S BECAUSE AMONG OTHER

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.008
THINGS IT'S GOT ABOUT FIVE

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:46.710
DIFFERENT LAYERS WHO COMPLEXITY.

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:49.379
MOST OTHER STATES HAVE ONE OR

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:52.215
TWO PLAYERS WE HAVE --

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.550
FIVE AND I'M IN THE LIMITED TIME

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:54.885
HAVE I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU ONE

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.353
EXAMPLE OF THE PRACTICAL EFFECT

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.322
OF THIS --

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:00.991
ABOUT A MONTH AGO I GOT A LETTER.

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:03.693
FROM THE CDC ADDRESS TO THE MOST

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.462
SENIOR AND PROBABLY THE MOST

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.264
SCHOLARLY JUDGE IN OUR COUNTY.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.498
ASKING HIM TO CORRECT THE LEGAL

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:11.034
HEIR THAT HE MADE IN THE SENSE.

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:11.701
AND I WENT OVER TO THE

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.236
COURTHOUSE TO LOOK ATTHE COURT

00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:15.238
FILE AND I WHEN I DID I REALIZE

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.773
THAT THIS LETTER WAS JUST.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.775
THE LAST IN A SERIES OF LETTERS

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.143
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.977
CORRECTIONS ASKING TO CORRECT

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.078
THIS ERROR.

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.814
WHICH HE REFUSED TO TAKE ANY

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.649
ACTION ON IT INSISTING THAT HE

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:26.883
WAS RIGHT AND THAT THE

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.418
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS WHICH

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:29.886
ACTUALLY WAS RIGHT IN THIS CASE

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:30.921
WAS WRONG.

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:32.155
SO I WAS CURIOUS I ASKED THE

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:34.558
CLERK TO GET A LOT OF THESE

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:35.091
LETTERS.

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:36.059
AND SHE SAID WELL I DON'T KNOW

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:38.795
WHAT YOU MEAN BY A LOT.

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.030
SO THAT KIND OF PIQUED MY

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:42.132
CURIOSITY SO I I EMAILED THE

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:44.134
PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER AT

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.836
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:47.003
AND I ASKED HIM HOW MANY OF

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.105
THESE LETTERS DO YOU SEND OUT.

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.173
SO EMAIL ME BACK HE SAYS IS

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.074
INTERESTING YOU ASK THAT

00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:52.776
QUESTION BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.845
BEEN ASKING THE SAME QUESTION.

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:57.013
ANY SAID WE WE SENT OUT A COUPLE

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.181
HUNDRED OF THESE IN THE LAST FEW

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.916
MONTHS.

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:01.384
AND APPARENTLY IN THE REVISED

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:02.886
BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR THERE'S TWO

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.522
MILLION DOLLARS TO BOLSTER THE

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.990
FOR THIS UNIT --

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:07.724
THAT EXPLORE SENTENCE

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:09.926
DISCREPANCIES.

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:11.928
SO THAT'S THAT'S GOOD THE JUDGES

00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:14.297
THE LAWYERS I LOOKED AT SOME OF

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:16.633
THE OPPOSITION AND I TRIED TO DO

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.068
THE NUMBERS AND I DON'T GET

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:18.668
ANYWHERE NEAR THE NUMBERS THAT

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.871
THEY GET.

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:22.305
AND I THAT'S I MEAN I'M RIGHT NO

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.740
WRONG I DON'T KNOW THAT IT DOES

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.242
AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:26.610
THIS THE ONE THING I KNOW. FOR

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:27.944
SURE ABOUT SENTENCING IS THAT

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.379
NOTHING CERTAIN.

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:30.614
AND I MAYBE WRONG THERE MAY BE

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.250
SOME OBSCURE SENTENCING RULER

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.451
ENHANCEMENT BURIED DEEP IN THE

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.752
PENAL CODE.

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.521
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE POINT

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:39.289
THAT WHEN YOU WRITE THESE LAWS

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.124
YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE.

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.459
EXECUTED IN UNIFORM A

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:43.827
PROPORTIONAL MANNER AND YOU

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:44.961
EXPECT THEM TO HAVE SOME

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.963
DETERRENT EFFECT.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.965
BUT IF THE SENIOR AND SCHOLARLY

00:52:49.032 --> 00:52:50.667
JUDGE CAN'T GET IT RIGHT IF

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.636
LAWYERS ON BOTH SIDES CAME TO

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:54.938
GET THE ARITHMETIC RIGHT.

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.206
THEN HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE LAWS

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:57.941
YOU ENACT.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.277
WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A UNIFORM

00:53:00.343 --> 00:53:01.945
A PROPORTIONAL MANNER.

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.480
AND OF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:04.814
CAN YOU EXPECT.

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:06.650
THE AVERAGE CITIZEN.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:07.551
THE HAVE ANY DETERRENT EFFECT ON

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.619
THIS.

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.854
THIS BILL IS NOT GONNA SWING

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.489
OPEN THE PRISON GATES.

00:53:12.556 --> 00:53:13.990
IT'S NOT GONNA SAN RECIDIVISM

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.592
RATES SOARING AND IT'S NOT GONNA

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.093
PREVENT JUDGES FROM STRICTLY

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.428
PUNISHING.

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:21.231
SERIOUS VIOLENT AND SEX OFFENSES

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.233

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.702
IN UNTANGLING IN SIMPLIFYING.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:27.404

VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE THE MOST

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.683
LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS.

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.284
AS NON VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE

SENTENCING STATUTES IN

CALIFORNIA ARE ARE EXTENSIVE BUT

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.316
THEY ARE NOT INDECIPHERABLE TO

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:54.984
THE PROSECUTORS THE DEFENSE

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.319
ATTORNEYS AND THE JUDGES WHO

IN EACH CASE BY THE PROSECUTORS

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.931

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:09.566
WHO HANDLE THESE CASES THIS IS

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.767
NOT ROCKET SCIENCE THIS IS

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.635
SOMETHING THAT WHEN YOU DO IT

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:13.336
FOR A LIVING.

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.138
YOU LEARN IT AND YOU DO IT

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.539
CORRECTLY OF COURSE THERE'S

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.274
ALWAYS GOING TO BE HUMAN ERROR.

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:19.743
HUMAN ERROR HAPPENS IN EVERY

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:21.144
SCENARIO IN LIFE BUT JUST

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.112
BECAUSE THERE COULD BE HUMAN

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:24.180
ERROR DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE GET

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:26.082
RID OF A BOTH A PROCESS THAT

00:56:26.149 --> 00:56:27.851
WORKS.

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.319
IN FACT THE CURRENT SENTENCING

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:30.520
LAWS SERVED A VERY IMPORTANT

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:33.289
PURPOSE THEY DIFFERENTIATE THE

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.091
PERSON WHO USES A GUN FROM THE

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.526
PERSON WHO DOES NOT USE A GUN

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:37.093
DURING THE COMMISSION OF AN

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.194
OFFENSE.

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.462
THE CURRENT LAWS DIFFERENTIATE

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:41.831
THE PERSON WHO SERIOUSLY INJURES

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:42.799
A HUMAN BEING DURING THE

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:44.334
COMMISSION OF OF AN OFFENSE FROM

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.602
THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT CAUSE

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.237
GREAT BODILY INJURY.

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.972
THE CURRENT LAW DIFFERENTIATES

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.707
THE PERSON WHO COMMITS ONE CRIME

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.208
AGAINST ONE VICTIM FROM THE

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:53.543
PERSON THAT COMMITS MULTIPLE

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.446
CRIMES AGAINST MULTIPLE VICTIMS.

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.448
THAT'S WHAT THE CURRENT LAWS ARE

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.350
THEREFORE TO TAKE INTO

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.951
CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.286
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAPPEN

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:04.988
WITHIN A CRIME AND NOT TO TREAT

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:07.423
EVERYBODY EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.759
THIS BILL HAS NO EXCEPTIONS FOR

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:12.729
GUN USE WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.130
PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:16.199
SPEAKING FOR LOS ANGELES WE HAVE

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.734
A HUGE PROBLEM WITH GUN VIOLENCE

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.369
IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.070
THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT MAKE AN

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.705
EXCEPTION FOR A CAUSING GREAT

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.641
BODILY INJURY OR FOR HAVING

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:27.310
MULTIPLE VICTIMS ROUTINELY IN

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.912
LOS ANGELES WE SEE.

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.747
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT ARMED

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.715
ROBBERIES AGAINST MULTIPLE

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:33.850
INDIVIDUAL SOMETIMES IN ONE

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:36.920
NIGHT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WE ONCE

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:39.255
PROSECUTED ARE FOR A DEFENDANT

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.423
WHO COMMITTED FIVE SEPARATE

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:42.625
ARMED ROBBERIES IN ONE NIGHT.

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.861
AGAINST EIGHT DIFFERENT VICTIMS

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:45.662
ONE OF THE VICTIMS WAS AN

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.130
ELDERLY WOMAN THAT HE SHOVED TO

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:48.464
THE GROUND BREAKING ONE OF HER

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.966
LIMBS.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.901
UNDER THIS BILL THE JUDGE WOULD

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:52.969
NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:54.270
CONSIDERATION THE GREAT BODILY

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:56.372
INJURY ALL OF THE OTHER ICTIMS

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:57.507
WHERE HE POINTED A GUN IN THEIR

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:58.741
FACES TOLD THEM HE WAS GOING TO

00:57:58.808 --> 00:57:59.709
KILL THEM.

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:00.310
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:03.413
CAP UNDER THIS BILL IF IT WERE

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:04.881
TO PASS THE MAXIMUM THAT PERSON

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.449
WOULD GET IS TEN YEARS WHEN

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:08.251
REALLY HE SHOULD BE FACING WELL

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.752
OVER.

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:10.320
THIRTY FIVE FOR ALL OF THE

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.554
DIFFERENT VICTIMS ALL OF THE

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.456
TIME TO USE THE GONE ALL OF THE

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:14.858
TIMES THAT HE COULD HAVE FIRED

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.059
THAT GUN WHAT IF ONE OF THE

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:17.493
VICTIMS HAD ACTUALLY JUMPED UP

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.761
AND TRIED TO TAKE THE GUN AWAY.

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.331
THAT HAPPENS THEN PEOPLE DIE AND

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:22.432
THAT'S WHY THE CURRENT

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.000
SENTENCING STATUTES RE

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.301
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY TAKE INTO

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.502
ACCOUNT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:27.770
SCENARIOS.

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:29.873

BRADFORD'S BILL.

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:28.031
BUT NOW IF THIS BILL WERE TO

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:29.866

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.634
IMPOSE A FIREARMS ENHANCEMENT IN

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.069
A PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE IS THE

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.938
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO.

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:36.572
THAT.

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:38.074

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.814
SPECIFIC EXCEPTION COULD CLOSE

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:05.781
TO LIKE.

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:08.084
THERE'S A SPECIFIC EXCEPTION FOR

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:08.684
SIX SIX SEVEN POINT SIX WHICH

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.219
ALLOWS FOR CONSECUTIVE

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:13.256
SENTENCING FOR FORCIBLE ANY SORT

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.957
OF FORCIBLE MOLESTATION IMPACT.

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:18.327
AND WHAT ABOUT --

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:18.895
FIVE ARMED ROBBERIES IN ONE

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.963
NIGHT.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.498
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU GO TO DOUBLE

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.433
WHAT IT IS FOR NON BRIBERY OR

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.270
WOULD YOU DO IF THE YOU YOU WILL

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.504
DOUBLE THE BASE TERM SO IF THE

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:30.273
JUDGE SAYS OKAY ARMED ROBBERY

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.641
THE MAXIMUM SENTENCES.

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.176
TAKE TEN YEARS YOU GET TWENTY

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.144
YEARS FOR THAT.

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:35.745
THAT'S NOT A LIGHT SENTENCE AT

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.380
ALL.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:39.348
YOU GET TWENTY YEARS FOR THAT SO

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.283
WHATEVER THAT SENTENCES WERE

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.351
SEEN DOUBLE THAT.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.554
AND AYE NW SHOULD EXPECT TO DO

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.189
MORE THAN THAT BASED ON THE

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.757
CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED WERE

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.492
SAYING DOUBLE THAT BASED TERM SO

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.027
WE EVEN TO JUDGE USE.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:51.694
THAT -- THE

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:54.130
MINIMUM SENTENCING --

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.065
THE MIDDLE RANGE OR THE MAXIMUM

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:56.566
RANGE WE SEE DOUBLE THAT

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:56.866
[inaudible]

01:03:56.933 --> 01:04:01.270
BASED BASIS YEAH I AGREE THAT.

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.506
A PEOPLE DON'T CALCULATE WHAT

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.007
THE TERM IS GOING TO BE WHEN

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.976
THEY GO OUT AND COMMIT A CRIME.

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.844
YEAH SO THAT I DON'T SEE THE

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.379
DETERRENCE VALUE FURTHER FOR

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:11.514
SOMEBODY'S BEEN IMPRISONED

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.416
TWENTY YEARS.

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.784
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERSON

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.953
COMING OUT TYPICALLY THESE ARE

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.621
DONE BY YOUNG MAN AND I GONNA

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.622
TALK ABOUT MIDDLE AGED MAN.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.890
SO I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.391
KEEPING THE MEN FOR THESE VERY

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.559
LONG TIMES.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:26.662
NOR BUT MAYBE YOU AND I COULD

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.564
WORK TOGETHER ON GETTING RID OF

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:29.966
SOME OF THIS COMPLEXITY SO

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.934
INSTEAD OF FIVE LAYERS LAYERS

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:32.969
THERE'S CHIU.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:36.706
OR WHATEVER RATHER THAN --

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.674
THIS APPROACH WHICH I AGREE WITH

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.942
THEM IN FACT I'D LIKE TO BE A CO

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.744
AUTHOR.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.246
HOW BECAUSE I THINK TOO MANY

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:46.082
PEOPLE END UP IN JAIL FOR TO LOG?

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:49.752
AND IT'S NOT A DETERRENT WAY AND

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.953
TO KEEP SOMEBODY AND YEARS

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:55.024
INSTEAD A TWENTY BUT THE

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.626
COMPLEXITY SOUNDS LIKE A REAL

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:58.828
ISSUE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:02.131
FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.499
DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LA IT

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.567
SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE DO MAKE

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:05.868
MISTAKES.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.169
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET RID

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.204

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.696
INTO IT IN OTHER WORDS I THINK

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:07.596
WE'VE SEEN THAT --

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.432

FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IN

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.745
CALIFORNIA IT'S TWO EIGHTY EIGHT

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.213

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:33.989
YEARS OLD.

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.391
YES YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET SIX

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.059
YEARS FOR THAT AND THERE'S GOING

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:38.561
TO BE GOOD TIME --

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:39.128

YOU'RE NOT IN --

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:43.699
SIX YEARS AND CERTAINLY I DON'T

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:45.201
SEE THAT IS LAUGHABLE IN ANY WAY

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.335
SHAPE OR FORM.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:47.136
I THINK THAT --

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:48.571
THERE THERE WOULD BE SOME VERY

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:51.974
SERIOUS INJUSTICES TO VICTIMS.

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.576
WE CAN TALK ABOUT TIMES.

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.911
TIME MEANT AND REHABILITATION

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.279
BUT THERE COMES A POINT TO WHERE

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.514
SOME OF THESE CRIMES ARE BEING

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.515
CONVICTED.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.417
ARE MORE THAN JUST.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.052
LAPSES OF JUDGMENT WHEN MAKING

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.888
IT SOUND LIKE IT'S SOMEBODY --

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.757
MAKING THE CHOICE TO DRIVE TO

01:07:07.823 --> 01:07:09.291
FASTER.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.926
NO WE HAVE VICTIMS THAT ARE.

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.261
IMPACTED BY SOMEONE IS CRIMINAL

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:14.730
OF BEHAVIORS FOR THEIR LIVES.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.198
THEY GET NO RELIEF FROM FROM

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:18.834
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.869
THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY VERY

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:20.336

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.016
WHO COME BEFORE JUDGES WHO ARE

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.985
REPRESENTED BY ATTORNEYS IN

BY JURIES HOPEFULLY A BUNCH OF

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.525

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.938

FEW HUNDREDS --

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:32.747
AND I THINK IT COULD GROW

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:33.548
INCREASINGLY.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.849

JUST FINISHED IN THE ARAB VALLEY --

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:40.422
SIXTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION ON

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:42.190
WATER RIGHTS IN THE BIG LOSERS

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.625
WAS THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:44.726
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR WATER CUT

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:48.496
BY 44% OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS --

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.665
THE PRIMARY CROP IS ALFALFA

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.867
WHICH REQUIRE SEVEN ACRE FEET OF

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:53.568
WATER.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.103
PER ACRE INDUSTRIAL HEMP IS

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:56.871
UNDER.

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.440
TWO SO --

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:00.909
LITTLE NO PESTICIDES LESS WATER.

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:03.945
CROP ACTUALLY PAYS BETTER THAN

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:06.114
ALFALFA I'VE HAD MANUFACTURERS

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.316

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:12.687
THE OUR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES%

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:13.788
BECAUSE THAT THEY HAVE WILL BE

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:15.357
THERE.

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.392
AND TO ALL THE NAYSAYERS OUT

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.061
THERE WHO WOULD THEN SAY WELL MY

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:21.629
GOD NO ONE ELSE IS GONNA BE

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.431
GROWING CORN OR ALFALFA THEY'RE

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:24.632
ONLY GOING TO BE GROWING HEMP

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.267
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM.

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:27.936

BUT THE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:31.039
THE MATTER IS IS IT'S NOT FOR US

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.707
THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE I MEAN

THEIR CROPS THAT THAT FIT.

01:23:52.394 --> 01:23:52.961
THE THE CONDITIONS THAT WE LIVE

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:56.631
IN AND HEMP IS ONE OF THE BEST

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.166
ROTATIONAL CROPS ACTUALLY HAD

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.300
HOPES TO REMEDIATE THE SOIL IT

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.902

WE MADE SURE OF WHEN WE PASSED

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:23.362

02:13:40.011 --> 02:13:41.046
COMPLIED WITH.

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:42.547

02:46:25.675 --> 02:46:28.244
SUPPORTIVE UP BUT NOT QUITE SURE

02:46:28.311 --> 02:46:30.613
IF -- ALL

ACROSS OUR STATE.

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:46.096
AND HOW BEST WE CAN DO SOMETHING

02:46:46.162 --> 02:46:47.464
THAT IS --

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:51.000
ACCEPTED ON ALL ON ALL LEVELS SO --

02:46:51.067 --> 02:46:54.237

THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE

02:46:55.205 --> 02:46:57.407
HAPPENED OR OCCURRED OR WHAT YOU

PLAN ON DOING FORWARD TO ENSURE

02:46:58.641 --> 02:47:00.076
THAT.

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:01.945
THE THE POSITIONS THAT WERE

02:47:02.011 --> 02:47:04.180

THE BILL AND NOW IN ITS AMENDED

02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:08.184
FORM NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL.

02:47:08.251 --> 02:47:09.252
AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW WE

02:47:09.319 --> 02:47:11.421
CAN BEST INTERPRET THAT --

02:47:11.488 --> 02:47:13.089
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ONE

02:47:13.156 --> 02:47:14.391

LIVE ON ON SOVEREIGN LAND.

02:47:17.961 --> 02:47:19.596
BUT THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:20.964
PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE IN

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:23.233
THESE COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE

02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:24.801
THAT WHAT WE DO AS A LEGISLATIVE

02:47:24.868 --> 02:47:32.308
BODY IT'S HELPFUL.

02:47:32.375 --> 02:47:34.344
CAN I LETTERS LETTER STATEMENT I

GO AHEAD.

02:47:37.714 --> 02:47:39.149
AND NOT SIMPLY PUT I JUST WANT

02:47:39.215 --> 02:47:40.550
TO SAY THIS THIS BILL.

02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:43.720

TECH HAS DECADES OF WORK ON

02:47:45.321 --> 02:47:47.257
BEHALF OF THE TRIBE.

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:48.057
ARE.

02:47:48.124 --> 02:47:48.691
THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THIS WITH

02:47:48.758 --> 02:47:50.894
THE TURN.

02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:53.763
FEDERAL LAW AS IT PERTAINS TO

02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:55.064
TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS VERY CLEARLY.

02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:56.866
MEAN THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP

02:47:56.933 --> 02:47:58.635
BETWEEN THE STATE.

02:47:58.701 --> 02:47:59.969
AT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND

02:48:00.036 --> 02:48:00.770

02:48:03.807 --> 02:48:05.642
LIMITED.

02:48:05.708 --> 02:48:07.343
AND AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

02:48:07.410 --> 02:48:09.846
AREAS WHERE WE WE NEED.

02:48:09.913 --> 02:48:11.414
STATE INVOLVEMENT TO CLARIFY THE

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:14.050
LAW OR TO PERMIT.

02:48:14.117 --> 02:48:16.786
AN ACTIVITY TO HAPPEN JUST LIKE

WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SIGN A COMPACT

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:19.923

02:48:28.932 --> 02:48:30.900
COMMITTEE.

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:33.770
WHERE ACTION WAS REQUIRED FOR US

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:35.338
TO BE INVOLVED IN PLANNING

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:36.973
AROUND TRIBES MAKING INVESTMENT

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.641

THE RESERVATIONS THERE THERE IS

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:56.259
A YOU KNOW.

02:48:56.326 --> 02:48:57.861
THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THE STATE

02:48:57.927 --> 02:48:59.462
WORK WITH TRIBES AND MANY AREAS

02:48:59.529 --> 02:49:00.597
IN THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TRIES

02:49:00.663 --> 02:49:01.965
WORK WITH STATE.

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:03.333
ON MANY AREAS AND THAT REQUIRES

02:49:03.399 --> 02:49:05.668
LEGISLATION --

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:08.004
WE HAVE EXPERTS THAT HAVE I

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:09.439
LOOKED INTO THIS AND SAID.

02:49:09.506 --> 02:49:11.241
THAT WE NEED THIS TO ACCOMPLISH

02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:13.176
OUR ULTIMATE GOAL.

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:13.810
WHEN WE TOOK THAT AMENDMENT THE

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:16.045
SENATE?

02:49:16.112 --> 02:49:17.914
AND IT DID IT DIDN'T REGISTER AT

02:49:17.981 --> 02:49:19.682
THAT AT THAT LEVEL WHITE RACISTS

02:49:19.749 --> 02:49:21.117
ARE HERE IS IS.

02:49:21.184 --> 02:49:22.218
UNKNOWN TO ME [inaudible]

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:25.355
BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL WE TOOK

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:27.257
THAT AMENDMENT IT WAS CONSISTENT

02:49:27.323 --> 02:49:28.558
WITH ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN

02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:30.894
ON COMPAQ'S.

02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.829
AND ARE THERE A <u>&lt;c.green&gt; TRIBES&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:49:32.896 --> 02:49:35.899
OPPOSED. TWO AT SOME OF THE

02:49:35.965 --> 02:49:39.068
LANGUAGE AND COMPACT ABSOLUTELY

02:49:39.135 --> 02:49:39.335
THEY ARE.

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:42.739
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S A IT'S

02:49:42.805 --> 02:49:46.376
A IT'S NOT A SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE.

02:49:46.442 --> 02:49:48.177
IT'S MORE OF A DISAGREEMENT IN

02:49:48.244 --> 02:49:49.212
TERMS OF HOW [inaudible]

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:52.348
A THEY SHOULD CONDUCT CERTAIN

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:53.349
ASPECTS OF THEIR THEIR BUSINESS

02:49:53.416 --> 02:49:55.251
ACTIVITIES.

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:57.353
AND AND NONE THE LESS THERE HAS

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.889
NEVER BEEN A CHALLENGE TO THAT.

02:49:59.956 --> 02:50:01.691
OTHER THAN A BALLOT INITIATIVE

02:50:01.758 --> 02:50:02.892
BACK AND BACK.

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:05.128
AWHILE BACK THAT THE CHALLENGED.

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:07.497
ARE THOSE BEING ADDED TO THE THE

02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:08.698
THE COMPACT WERE OVERTURNED BY

02:50:08.765 --> 02:50:09.699
THE PUBLIC.

02:50:09.766 --> 02:50:12.201
AND IT WAS.

02:50:12.268 --> 02:50:14.003
BUT ACTION THAT REQUIRED AGAIN A

02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:16.306
STATE LAW.

02:50:16.372 --> 02:50:18.741
SO I THINK FOR THE TRIBES MANY

02:50:18.808 --> 02:50:20.643
OF THEM THAT ALREADY HAVE THESE

02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:21.844
PROVISIONS IN THE COMPACT THEY

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:23.212
SEE IT WE DON'T SEE THE HARM

02:50:23.279 --> 02:50:24.480
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY.

02:50:24.547 --> 02:50:26.249
A STATE LAW.

02:50:26.316 --> 02:50:30.320
THIS BASICALLY REITERATES --

02:50:30.386 --> 02:50:31.654
THE STATE LAW I THINK FOR IT FOR

02:50:31.721 --> 02:50:33.423
THIS BILL ADVANCE WE WE LOOKED

02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:36.059
AT AND SAID THERE ISN'T A HARM.

02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:37.794
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY LAW THERE'S

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:40.263
NO REASON THAT ADDING IT TO THIS

02:50:40.330 --> 02:50:42.265
PROVISION WOULD CREATE.

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:43.833
A DOES A CREATOR REDUNDANT

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:45.301
REDUNDANCY YES AT US I AGREE

02:50:45.368 --> 02:50:47.070
WITH THAT.

02:50:47.136 --> 02:50:48.171
BUT DOES THAT CREATE A CONFLICT

02:50:48.237 --> 02:50:49.806
NO IT DOESN'T.

02:50:49.872 --> 02:50:50.907
SO WE DON'T SEE HARM IN ADDING

02:50:50.974 --> 02:50:52.408
THAT.

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:53.843
AND WE NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:56.145
BECOMES AN ISSUE. TO BE HONEST

02:50:56.212 --> 02:50:57.547
WITH YOU BECAUSE I MEAN THE

02:50:57.614 --> 02:50:59.182
TRIBES BASICALLY.

02:50:59.248 --> 02:51:01.985
ARE CONSULTED AND SAID --

02:51:02.051 --> 02:51:02.986
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WE SHOULD

02:51:03.052 --> 02:51:04.954
MOVE FORWARD THERE IS A AS YOU

02:51:05.021 --> 02:51:07.657
SEE A THREE TRIBES MAYBE.

02:51:07.724 --> 02:51:08.691
FOUR ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BUT

02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:10.326
THIS IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:10.793
HUNDRED NINE TRIBES IN

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:12.862
CALIFORNIA.

02:51:12.929 --> 02:51:14.530
CHAU EVERY TRIED THIS IN

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:16.299
OPPOSITION ACTUALLY HAS.

02:51:16.366 --> 02:51:17.533
THIS LABOR RELATIONS POUND THEIR

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:18.768
CURRENT COMPACT.

02:51:18.835 --> 02:51:21.004
IT DOESN'T PROTECT EMPLOYEES WHO

02:51:21.070 --> 02:51:23.840
COMMIT THESE PETTY CRIMES BUT IT

02:51:23.906 --> 02:51:25.008
ONLY REALLY PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE

02:51:25.074 --> 02:51:26.409
THAT ARE NORMALLY GOING THROUGH

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:27.877
THEIR ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES.

02:51:27.944 --> 02:51:30.046
SO IT ALLOWS FOR NOTHING MORE

02:51:30.113 --> 02:51:31.214
THAT'S ALREADY AGREED TO BUY

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.217
THOSE TRIBES IN THEIR COMPACTS.

02:51:34.283 --> 02:51:36.486
COME OUT OF THE OF COURSE

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:36.786
[inaudible]

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:38.254
WELL SCUD.

02:51:38.321 --> 02:51:39.656
I WAS SO --

02:51:39.722 --> 02:51:40.857
THAT TOUCHES UPON SOMEONE I WAS

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:42.425
GONNA ASK AYE AYE PROPS ONE TO

02:51:42.492 --> 02:51:43.693
BE OPPOSITION A CHANCE TO

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:44.927
RESPOND TO THAT POINT IN

02:51:44.994 --> 02:51:46.763
PARTICULAR THIS --

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:48.164
GOES NO FURTHER THAN WHAT'S

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:50.733
CURRENTLY IN THE CONTACTS.

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:52.635
YOU I WON'T I'M TICKET TAKE A

02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:54.537
STAB AT THAT ON IT IS MY

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:56.639
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT SO

02:51:56.706 --> 02:51:58.841
MUCH THE PROCESS IT'S THE ORDER

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:00.376
OF THE PROCESS.

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:02.578
THAT IS AT ISSUE IN TERMS OF IT

02:52:02.645 --> 02:52:03.680
WHEN OF THIS CLEARANCE AND

02:52:03.746 --> 02:52:06.115

AND PERCENT TO THE LANGUAGE IN

02:52:07.650 --> 02:52:08.651
THE BILL.

02:52:08.718 --> 02:52:09.385
SO -- YOU

02:52:09.452 --> 02:52:12.488

REACHED OUT TO TRY TO CLARIFY

02:52:15.992 --> 02:52:17.560
THAT ANY --

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:19.128
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INVOLVE A

VARIATIONS OF THAT OPINION BUT

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.768
THIS IS WHY DISCUSSION IS

02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:27.003
NECESSARY.

02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:29.105
BUT FOR BARONE IS PART WE HAVE

02:52:29.172 --> 02:52:31.941

02:52:44.854 --> 02:52:45.888
LABOR RELATED ACTIVITY.

02:52:45.955 --> 02:52:48.291
AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS A FAIR

02:52:48.357 --> 02:52:50.259
LIMITATION ON THIS SORT OF

02:52:50.326 --> 02:52:53.229
PERMISSION OR PRE CLEARANCE UP

02:52:53.296 --> 02:52:54.630
PROCESS --

02:52:54.697 --> 02:52:57.800
BUT WE WHAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY A

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.302
AND WE OFFERED WHAT WE THOUGHT

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:02.839
AND WAS REALLY SORT OF SURGICAL --

02:53:02.905 --> 02:53:05.675
FOCUS TO CLARIFYING LANGUAGE --

02:53:05.742 --> 02:53:07.643
WAS TO CLARIFY THAT IF THERE ARE

02:53:07.710 --> 02:53:10.780
ANY TRULY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:13.716
THAT GO WELL BEYOND LEGAL --

02:53:13.783 --> 02:53:15.351
LABOR ACTIVITIES THEN THAT WOULD

02:53:15.418 --> 02:53:16.719
NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE PRE

02:53:16.786 --> 02:53:18.488
CLEARANCE.

02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:21.023
SO THAT'S ONE IDEA AND ONE

02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:23.092
EXAMPLE THAT WAS FLOATED BUT

02:53:23.159 --> 02:53:23.960
THERE WAS NO MEANINGFUL

02:53:24.026 --> 02:53:26.929
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IDEA --

02:53:26.996 --> 02:53:28.164
INSTEAD THERE WAS JUST AS SORT

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:30.199
OF AN OUTRIGHT DISMISSAL.

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:31.667
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT TOO IF

THAT EMPLOYEE WOULD BE FIRED FOR

DO BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL

02:55:27.383 --> 02:55:28.818
DISCUSSION.

02:55:28.885 --> 02:55:31.854
COULD BEAR FRUIT ON THIS POINT

02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:34.423
BUT TO DATE WHAT WE'VE RECEIVED

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:35.925

THESE PROBLEMS WOULD WOULD BE

03:12:02.844 --> 03:12:04.746
WHAT IT WHAT IS THIS BILL DO.

03:12:04.813 --> 03:12:07.082
IT IMPROVES THERE ARE EXISTING

03:12:07.148 --> 03:12:09.718
STATUTE BY ELIMINATING THE FEES

03:12:09.784 --> 03:12:10.886
FOR ISSUING.

03:12:10.952 --> 03:12:15.323
A ORDER WE DO NOT WANT THE COST

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:16.758
TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO SOMEONE

03:12:16.825 --> 03:12:18.793
SEEKING A PETITION.

03:12:18.860 --> 03:12:21.196
IT ALSO EXPANDS THE G. BUREAU TO

03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:24.232
COVER FIRE ARM COMPONENTS NOW I

03:12:24.299 --> 03:12:25.834
HAD A LEGITIMATE QUESTION ABOUT

03:12:25.901 --> 03:12:26.735
WHY.

03:12:26.801 --> 03:12:28.536
BECAUSE IN INDIVIDUAL FIREARM

03:12:28.603 --> 03:12:30.372
COMPONENT OBVIOUSLY IT CAN'T

03:12:30.438 --> 03:12:32.574
JUST BE AS DEADLY AS A FIREARM

03:12:32.641 --> 03:12:34.209
BUT AS WE KNOW FIRE ARMS CAN BE

03:12:34.276 --> 03:12:35.610
DISASSEMBLED.

03:12:35.677 --> 03:12:38.380
AND UNLESS BE A PERSON --

03:12:38.446 --> 03:12:41.149
ARRIVING TO ISSUE THE AND WHAT

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:43.218
IF THEY DO NOT ASK FOR ALL FIRE

03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:44.586
EARN COMPONENTS YOU COULD HAVE A

03:12:44.653 --> 03:12:46.588
SITUATION WHERE THE PERSON HAS

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:48.623
DISASSEMBLED A FIRE ARM.

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:50.258
AND THAT'S THEY'VE NOT RECOVERED

03:12:50.325 --> 03:12:51.426
THE FIRE ARMS IN THE PERSON'S

03:12:51.493 --> 03:12:52.994
POSSESSION.

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:55.363
SO THAT IS PART OF THE REASON

03:12:55.430 --> 03:12:57.132
FOR THAT AMENDMENT.

03:12:57.198 --> 03:12:59.334
ADDITIONALLY IT IMPROVES DUE

03:12:59.401 --> 03:13:02.537
PROCESS BY REQUIRING A HEARING

03:13:06.508 --> 03:13:08.209
SO WE'VE AND RITUALLY DESIGNED

03:13:08.276 --> 03:13:09.878
THE STATUE TO RESPECT DUE

03:13:09.945 --> 03:13:11.880
PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:12.747
SAW.

03:13:12.814 --> 03:13:14.316
OVER TIME THAT WE HAD FAILED TO

03:13:14.382 --> 03:13:17.018
REQUIRE THAT HEARING IN THE US

03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:18.920
HEARINGS WERE NOT OCCURRING SO

03:13:18.987 --> 03:13:21.957
THAT'S THE BILL IN ITS FORM.

03:13:22.023 --> 03:13:24.192
ANDA I WOULD LIKE ME WITNESSES

03:13:24.259 --> 03:13:26.161

03:13:37.272 --> 03:13:40.408
URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SP TWELVE

03:13:40.475 --> 03:13:40.942
HUNDRED A BILL WE HAVE CO

03:13:41.009 --> 03:13:42.010
SPONSORED.

03:13:42.077 --> 03:13:43.578
THIS BILL MAKES IMPORTANT AND

03:13:43.645 --> 03:13:45.780
RELATIVELY MINOR CHANGES TO THE

03:13:45.847 --> 03:13:47.115
EXISTING GUN VIOLENCE

03:13:47.182 --> 03:13:49.017
RESTRAINING ORDER LAW AND AS THE

03:13:49.084 --> 03:13:50.685
SENATOR MENTIONED IT WOULD

03:13:50.752 --> 03:13:52.954
INSURE THAT INABILITY TO PAY IS

03:13:53.021 --> 03:13:54.155
NEVER A BARRIER TO PREVENTING

03:13:54.222 --> 03:13:55.890
VIOLENCE.

03:13:55.957 --> 03:13:57.625
IT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT HARDER FOR

03:13:57.692 --> 03:13:58.960
RESPONDENTS TO ASSEMBLE

03:13:59.027 --> 03:14:01.496
FUNCTIONAL FIREARMS BY REQUIRING

03:14:01.563 --> 03:14:02.764
THEM TO RELINQUISH PARTS AND

03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:04.799
COMPONENTS THAT ARE CLEARLY

03:14:04.866 --> 03:14:08.770
DESIGNED AND INTENDED TO BE USED

03:14:08.837 --> 03:14:09.270
TO ASSEMBLE.

03:14:09.337 --> 03:14:11.673
A FULLY FUNCTIONAL FIREARM THIS

03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.108
IS NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

03:14:13.174 --> 03:14:14.309
SPRINGS HERE WE ARE TALKING

03:14:14.376 --> 03:14:15.710
ABOUT UNFINISHED FRAMES AND

03:14:15.777 --> 03:14:17.612
RECEIVERS.

03:14:17.679 --> 03:14:19.381
THIRD IT WOULD MAKE IT HARDER

03:14:19.447 --> 03:14:21.182
FOR PERSON TO USE A FIRE ARM

03:14:21.249 --> 03:14:22.617
ILLEGALLY BY REQUIRING

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:23.785
RESPONDENTS TO RELINQUISH

03:14:23.852 --> 03:14:25.520
MAGAZINES.

03:14:25.587 --> 03:14:27.055
AND IT WOULD ALSO IN SHORT THAT

03:14:27.122 --> 03:14:28.456
A ONE YEAR HEARING IT'S SAD

03:14:28.523 --> 03:14:29.824

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:38.533
PARTE ORDERS.

03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:39.667
THE BILL WOULD ALSO MAKE IT

03:14:39.734 --> 03:14:41.036
EASIER FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:42.404
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO KNOW

RELINQUISHED FIREARMS.

03:14:47.475 --> 03:14:49.010
BECAUSE THESE FIXES TO THE G.

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:50.612
VERO STATUTE ARE MODEST

03:14:50.678 --> 03:14:52.747

INCREDIBLY POWERFUL EXAMPLES OF

03:15:27.215 --> 03:15:28.950
THE UTILITY OF THIS TOOL --

03:15:29.017 --> 03:15:30.351
THE EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE SEEN

03:15:30.418 --> 03:15:32.487

LAW THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION BY

03:16:30.678 --> 03:16:31.880
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT WOULD

03:16:31.946 --> 03:16:35.416
HAVE LEFT BEHIND --

USED LEGISLATIVELY WITH REGARD

03:18:10.511 --> 03:18:14.449
TO WHAT CONSTITUTES A GUN PART --

03:18:14.515 --> 03:18:17.518
IS OPEN TO MASSIVE --

03:18:17.585 --> 03:18:19.587
INTERPRETATION AND IT IN REALITY

03:18:19.654 --> 03:18:21.289
IF THEY HAD TRIGGERS BARRELS

03:18:21.356 --> 03:18:21.589
[inaudible]

03:18:21.656 --> 03:18:23.324
STOCKS.

03:18:23.391 --> 03:18:26.194
GRIPS ALL OF THOSE THINGS THERE.

03:18:26.261 --> 03:18:28.263
UNLESS THEY HAD THAT PORTION

03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:31.866
THAT IS THE FIRE ARM ITSELF --

03:18:31.933 --> 03:18:33.601
IT IS ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD

03:18:33.668 --> 03:18:34.202
NEVER BECOME A GUN [inaudible]

03:18:34.269 --> 03:18:36.738
NOW.

03:18:36.804 --> 03:18:39.040
SO EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

KNOWS THAT A RECEIVER WEATHER

03:18:40.608 --> 03:18:41.976
STRIP OR FULLY ASSEMBLED INTO

03:18:42.043 --> 03:18:44.445
THE GUN IS IS THE GUN AND IS THE

03:18:44.512 --> 03:18:47.915
CRITICAL PART. TO MAKE A GUN SO --

03:18:47.982 --> 03:18:49.250
HE IS.

03:18:49.317 --> 03:18:50.451
THE DEFINITION YOU KNOW IF

03:18:50.518 --> 03:18:51.953
SOMEBODY SEES A TRIGGER GROUP

03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:53.021
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD GO INTO

03:18:53.087 --> 03:18:54.222
NAY ARE FIFTEEN OR SOMETHING

03:18:54.289 --> 03:18:56.724
LIKE THAT OR A BOLT ACTION RIFLE.

03:18:56.791 --> 03:18:58.192
CLEARLY IT'S A TRICKLE GROUP

03:18:58.259 --> 03:18:59.193
CRADLED CLEARLY IT'S A PART OF A

03:18:59.260 --> 03:19:01.129
GUN BUT I COULD NEVER BECOME A

03:19:01.195 --> 03:19:02.263
GUN OR BE USED.

03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:04.532
AS SUCH THE OTHER CONCERN THAT

03:19:04.599 --> 03:19:06.200
WE HAVE IS WITH THE THAT THE GBR

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:07.335
ROSE AND WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT

03:19:07.402 --> 03:19:08.536
OF RESEARCH TO FIND THAT.

03:19:08.603 --> 03:19:09.971
THERE BEEN UP APPROXIMATELY TWO

03:19:10.038 --> 03:19:11.139
HUNDRED EUROS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:19:11.205 --> 03:19:11.973
ISSUED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:13.041
IDENTIFY.

03:19:13.107 --> 03:19:15.176
AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE

03:19:15.243 --> 03:19:17.578
HAVE AS FAR AS THE THE ABUSE OF

03:19:17.645 --> 03:19:21.215
PEOPLE FILING THEM ALICIA SALI.

03:19:21.282 --> 03:19:22.083
ARE HAVE NOT OCCURRED.

03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:23.818
BUT THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS

03:19:23.885 --> 03:19:24.519
THAT.

03:19:24.585 --> 03:19:26.454
PUTTING OUR ATTENTION AND AND

03:19:26.521 --> 03:19:28.923

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND IN

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:36.531
REALITY.

03:19:36.597 --> 03:19:37.632
ANYBODY CAN ASK A LAW

03:19:37.699 --> 03:19:39.634
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO REQUESTED

03:19:39.701 --> 03:19:41.102
UV RO.

03:19:41.169 --> 03:19:43.705
IT'S GRANTED AND THEY THEY GET

03:19:43.771 --> 03:19:44.972
THEY LOSE THEIR GUNS THAT YEAH

03:19:45.039 --> 03:19:46.641
WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ARE

GUNS [inaudible]

03:19:47.675 --> 03:19:48.910
BUT THEN.

03:19:48.976 --> 03:19:51.546
NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS.

03:19:51.612 --> 03:19:53.214
IF YOU'RE DANGER TO YOURSELF FOR

03:19:53.281 --> 03:19:55.249
OTHERS YOU JUST GO OUT THERE AND

03:19:55.316 --> 03:19:56.150
NOTHING IN THE LAW PREVENTS YOU

03:19:56.217 --> 03:19:57.785
FROM.

03:19:57.852 --> 03:20:00.154
BORROWING A GUN OR YOU CAN BREAK

03:20:00.221 --> 03:20:00.855
THE LAW AND STEAL A GUN OR

03:20:00.922 --> 03:20:02.090
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE IS WE

03:20:02.156 --> 03:20:03.191
BELIEVE THAT THEIR EXISTING

03:20:03.257 --> 03:20:04.726
PROCEDURES AND IN STATE LAW

ALREADY IN PLACE --

03:20:07.028 --> 03:20:09.831
IN IN PLACE THAT WILL --
