HOWEVER AS WE KNOW THE PROSPERITY HAS NOT BENEFIT IS NOT BENEFITING ALL SECTORS ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE IN CERTAIN CERTAIN POPULATION GROUPS ARE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND. CALIFORNIA IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS EXPERIENCE WITH GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY.

SO IF WE CAN BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL OR I'D LIKE TO WELCOME JOHN ROSS FILLED AND CAROLINE SHUE. AND WITH IT WE RIGHT UP HERE PLEASE. SO AS A SPEAKERS GET SETTLED IN LET ME FIRST I INTRODUCED JOHN ROCK FILLED INVESTMENT TO DIRECTOR AND HAD ECONOMIST OF CALPERS INVESTMENT OFFICES -- PRIOR TO JOINING CALPERS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MISTER ROCKFORD HAD. EIGHTEEN YEAR CAREER IN GLOBAL MARKETS RESEARCH AND STRESS STRATEGY AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH AND BEFORE THAT FOR CHICAGO BANK -- IN THE AUSTRALIAN TREASURY INCLUDING A STINT AT THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND IN WASHINGTON DC -- GIVEN THE TECHNICAL NATURE OF THIS PEN I'M GOING TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THIS PRESENTATION. OKAY AND CAN I ASK HOW MUCH TIME IS INVOLVED -- FOR THIS PARTICULAR PANEL I COULD EVEN GO TO FIVE MINUTES OR TWO HOURS I BELIEVE WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR FOR THIS -- AND LET ME SEE -- OKAY GOOD -- SO AT THANK YOU FOR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY -- KILLED HOUSEHOLD OWNERSHIP -- WAGE INCREASES FOR RELATIVELY LOW INCOME EARNERS AT THAT STARTED TO FEED INTO THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION THAT WE'VE HAD -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE THE BACKWARD LOOKING FOR ME WAS PRETTY GOOD. WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS IS. SEVENTEEN AND THIS IS PRELIMINARY DATA BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN IN THE IN IN IN IN -- WASHINGTON -- WE DON'T HAVE FULL DAY YET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT COMES OUT THE TWO DAYS FROM NOW. BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE ECONOMY AS I MENTIONED EXPANDED FROM A TWO AND A QUARTER PERCENT RATE TO A 3% RIGHT. A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSUMER SPENDING WE ALL GOT A TAX CUT LAST YEAR -- SOME OF US TO DISAPPOINTED BY THE REFUNDS WE GETTING BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WITHHOLDING WAS TAKEN DOWN SO PEOPLE HAD MORE MONEY TO SPEND -- THE GOVERNMENT ALSO GOVERNMENTS ALSO STARTED TO SPEND A LOT MORE SICKLY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO FEDERAL SPENDING ON DEFENSE -- BUT STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HIRING AND CAP EX IN OTHER FORMS OF SPENDING IN THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL ALSO WENT UP -- QUITE STRONGLY IN THE ONE AREA OF THE ECONOMY THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY WEEK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS HOUSING. AND WE HAD SOME MORE DANGER OUT TODAY SHOWING THAT HOUSING STARTS WITH VERY WEAK TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR SO. HOUSING IS CLEARLY AN AREA OF THE ECONOMY THAT HAS SLOWED DOWN. IN PASTA CANONIC CYCLES THIS A CONCERN. BUT IN THIS CYCLE WE'VE HAD SUCH A SLOW RECOVERY A SLOW AND MEASURED RECOVERY IN HOUSING. WE HAVEN'T HAD -- AN EXCESSIVE USE OF MORTGAGE DEBT FOR HOUSEHOLD EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST CYCLE BUT BECAUSE THE WHOLE ECONOMIC EXPANSION BLOW UP. WE'VE HAD A MUCH MORE MAY SHOULD IMPROVEMENT IN HOUSING A LOT OF IT IS BEING IN THE MULTI SPACES POST A SINGLE FAMILY. AND SO -- THE SLOWDOWN RECENTLY IT'S BEEN DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS ONE IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BEING SPENDING MORE RAISES INTEREST RATES SO KIND OF CROWDS OUT SOME OF THE ACTIVITY. IN HOUSING IS ALSO A BIG SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BY HOUSING -- YOU CAN SEE THAT IN JOB ADS IN HOUSING A VERY STRONG YET THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED HASN'T GONE UP. ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AND OTHER HOUSING CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GONE UP ABOUT 50% IN THE LAST YEAR SO. X. IT'S EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A HOUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO FIND WORKERS AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES OF COURSE TO SLOW DOWN. BUT WE DON'T THINK THE SLOWDOWN IN HOUSING -- IS THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF HOUSING COULD HAVE A BETTER YEAR IN. TWENTY NINE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT IMPROVING THE ECONOMY LAST YEAR. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MATTER THROUGH INTO FINANCIAL MARKETS IN FACT THE STOCK MARKET HEADED DOWN YEAR WHY IS THAT. IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE THE STOCK MARKET TENDS TO BE FORWARD LOOKING SO. WE DID HAVE A VERY GOOD -- A YEAR FOR THE ECONOMY TWENTY SEVENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THE MARKET SO WORRIED ABOUT TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THE BOND AND THE STOCK MARKET WHICH IS WHAT WE LOOK. FOR THE RETURNS IN IN CALPERS PORTFOLIO SO WHAT WHAT ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT ONE THING THAT AGAIN CHAIRMAN PAL. MENTION TODAY IN THE SEMI ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY. WAS HAVE THE POLICIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. LED TO A QUICK A RAIN TO THE EXPANSION BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN THE ECONOMY A SUGAR HIGH IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR IS THERE A SUPPLY SIDE REVOLUTION IT'S A LOT OF THIS KIND OF DEBATES WE WERE HAVING -- IN IN THE REAGAN YEARS IS THIS A SUPPLY SIDE REFORM OR IS IT ADVANCE SIDE. AND SO. A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION. LAST YEAR -- WE WE GOT A LOT MORE FOLKS INTERESTED IN LOOKING FOR JOBS WAGE RISES STARTED TO IMPROVE. AND SENTIMENT SURVEYS WERE SHOWING SOME PEOPLE FELT VERY COMFORTABLE THERE WERE PLENTY OF JOBS OUT THERE FOR THEM. AND THERE WAS ALSO A LOT MORE -- BECAUSE GOING ON THE ECONOMY AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE STARTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THE STRONG LABOR MARKET FEEDING THROUGH INTO LOWER INCOME CO HOLDS. THE FEMALE LIFE PORTAL FORCED PARTICIPATION WENT UP VERY SHOPPING -- STICK WITH THE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD AND ALSO FOR LATINO HISPANIC -- GROUPS IN THE LABOR FORCE SO THAT WAS VERY ENCOURAGING BUT IT HAS TO CONTINUE. ANOTHER ONE IS PRODUCTIVITY AND ANOTHER ONE IS -- DOES THE FED HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY -- TO ALLOW THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION TO KEEP GOING AND THAT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT SINCE DECEMBER WAY FED CHAIRMAN PAL -- SAID THAT THE FED COULD AFFORD TO WHITE. AND CALIBRATE ECONOMY A LITTLE LIST MECHANISTICALLY THAN IT HAD BEEN FILLING ON WHEN IT STARTED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES. IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE FED CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES TO SO THE ECONOMY STARTING TO BACK OFF WHEN THEY RAISE INTEREST RATES. AND THEY BACKED OFF RAISING RATES IN FACT I CUT RATES IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND NINETY NINETY EIGHT SAID THAT FIT FLEXIBILITY. IS ONE REASON THAT PEOPLE WILL BECOME THE FOCAL -- ONE OF THE SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION -- IN IN BULLET POINT FORM THREE FOR THE CHALLENGES WHY ARE THE MARKETS KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT EIGHTEEN ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT THE US ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS GETTING VERY LONG BY JUNE IT WILL BE A RECORD. TEN YEAR ECONOMIC EXPANSION. JAPAN'S IN FACT NOW SEVENTY FIVE MONTHS A POST WORLD WAR TWO RECORD OF AB SEVENTY FIVE MONTHS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS AROUND THE GLOBE LOOKING LONG IN THE TOOTH. THAT BELIEVE THAT MEANS THAT THERE START TO BE HEAD WINS AGAINST ECONOMIC GROWTH RATHER THAN TAIL WIND SO. THE MATURITY OF SOME OF THE ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS IS A PROBLEM. ANOTHER ONE IS OF THE LABOR MARKET IS VERY TIGHT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR WORK -- IS IS GETTING VERY VERY LOVE SO. WE NEED TO THINK A AND THEN FED CHAIRMAN PAL ALSO MENTION THIS IS MORNING WE START WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT INNOVATIVE WAYS. TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO LOOKING FOR JOBS WITH THAT'S GOING INTO PRISONS WHETHER IT'S GOING -- INTO THE OPIOID -- PROBLEM PARTICULARLY WITH THE YOUNG MALES WE WE DON'T HAVE THE POOL OF LABOR THE DRAWER ON YET -- THE WE HAVE BEEN FEMALES -- IN IN IN THE LABOR FORCE SAID. NOW THAT PROBLEM CLEAR ITSELF UP A LITTLE BIT IN TWENTY EIGHT TO EIGHT BUT THAT COULD JUST BE TEDIOUS SOCRATIC. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS TO THE U. S. ENGAGED IN A TRADE WAR GLOBALLY NOT ANY WITH CHINA BUT WITH YOUR NOW WE SAY THAT WE CAN BE IN THAT WINDOW FROM THAT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC DATA. TYPICALLY U. S.. THE US ECONOMY IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE. SO I COOL AND WE START TO SLOW DOWN GLOBAL YEAR OF THE TURNING AND SALES AS WELL. AND THAT'S A BIG THING WITH THE LOCAL AT THAT THE US INVESTORS HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT -- THIS YEAR. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT. EVEN THOUGH DIRECT TRADE IS ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR ECONOMY. S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES SO THEY PRODUCING A BROAD INTO FOREIGN MARKETS SO. THAT THEY START TO SEE A TRADE WAR -- THEY THEY THE CORPORATE SECOND FLOOR -- CHINA SLOWDOWN IS ANOTHER BIG ISSUE AND AND THE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A PARTICULARLY WHEN WE CATCH WITH CHINA. CHINA'S ECONOMY HAS ACTUALLY SLOWED DOWN THE EFFICIENT NUMBER SAY SIX AND SIX AND CHANGE. SOME OF THE MORE AGGREGATED PARTIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS SAYING CHINA'S ANY GROWING 32425% -- CHINA HAS PLENTY OF LEVELS IN WHICH TO TRY AND IMPROVE ITS FARMING. THE SOMETHING CALLED IMPOSSIBLE TRINITY WHICH SAYS THAT CHINA CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING. AND RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THEIR STARTING -- TO BOTTOM OUT THE IS THAT -- THEY WANT TO BE ABLE. TO IN TIME TO PREVENT A BIGGER SLOWDOWN IN CHINA'S ECONOMY. THE U. S. FEDERAL DEBT TRAJECTORIES BIG ISSUE -- YOU EXTEND HIS BRIAN -- SHOCKLEY SAN USUAL FOR THIS STAGE OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE WILL BE -- FOR THE US TO BE RUNNING SUCH. A LARGE LEVEL OF ANNUAL DEBT. AND ON MARCH ONE WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE EXTENSION OF THE DEBT CEILING WHICH IS BEING SYSTEM FOR AWHILE. AND IN FIVE FINALLY -- ONE MORE I WILL MENTION IS THAT CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD SINCE. TWO THOUSAND NINE HAVE BEEN ADDING LIQUIDITY TO THE GLOBAL SYSTEM THROUGH. BUYING PHONES ESSENTIALLY AND THAT GETS INTO BANK RESERVES SO IF HE PROVES YOU BELIEVE BANKS TO LEND Là IT ENDS UP IN HOUSE PRICES. IT ENDS UP IN STOCK AND BOND PRICES. RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HAS STOPPED DOING QUANTITATIVE EASING THE FED IS ACTUALLY REVERSING ITS QUANTITATIVE EASING. SO THERE'S A BIG LIQUIDITY IMPACT ON THE WORLD. WHICH SAY THE GROWTH WILL NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO GET -- A GOOD OUTCOMES -- FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THAT LEADS INTO CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND CORPORATE BEHAVIOR IF FINANCIAL MARKETS ON STRONG. SO OVERALL I WOULD SAY -- YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS A GOOD YEAR -- FOR THE U. S. ECONOMY -- BUT FINANCIAL MARKETS AND AND IN GENERAL WHEN YOU WE LOOK FOR WE START TO SEE SOME MORE PROBLEMS. BASED ON THINGS LIKE MATURITY OF THE CYCLE -- FEDERAL DEBT -- AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS -- AGAIN MY MESSAGE WOULD PROBABLY BE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTIES MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT THE WILL BE SO -- UP UNTIL NOW IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUESTIONS -- IF MISTER ROTH OF THE THOUGHT IS OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS MOMENT HAVE ANY YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER I FEEL THAT WITH WHAT INFORMATION TO FIT IN IN THE TIME THAT YOU YOU MEASURED IT BUT THANK YOU I'M IF I WAS WONDER IF YOU COULD PLEASE SPEAK TO SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE GOAL GLOBAL TRADE WAR -- WE AT AGE IT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU -- CAROLINE MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO TALK ABOUT I'D I I WORK IN THE AREA OF THE CALPERS WHICH LOOKS AT THE BIG MORE MACRO ENVIRONMENT SO -- I DON'T REALLY HAVE A FEEL FOR WHICH INDUSTRIES HAVE BEEN MORE AFFECTED OBVIOUSLY THE TRADING GAUGE WENT HAS BEEN. MORE ONEROUS FOR THINGS LIKE TECH. AS OPPOSED TO THE FOLKS WHO MAKE SERVICE SECTOR GOODS -- SO -- IN THIS LATEST ROUND OF REPORTING BY THE S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES WE ACTUALLY PEOPLE IN HEALTHCARE AND LUXURY GOODS SILES WAITRESSES ENGAGEMENT WITH CHINA IS ACTUALLY GOING REALLY WELL. SUCH A REAL BIFURCATION I THINK BETWEEN TAKEN INDUSTRY MANUFACTURING VERSES SERVICE SECTOR WHICH OF CHINA'S TRY TO RE BALANCE OUR ECONOMY MORE -- MORTARBOARD SCHOOL WOULD -- SERVICE SECTOR PURCHASES -- THAT ENGAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY BEEN FAIRLY POSITIVE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN EARLIER YOU MENTION ABOUT THE SLOWING HOUSING MARKET -- YOU MENTIONED YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL FACTORS THAT SO BASICALLY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE TO THAT SITUATION. DIMENSION RENT CONTROL AND THE YOU KNOW. UP -- I NOTED THERE WAS SOME CONCERTED EFFORT AT ALL WORKING ON THE RENT CONTROL WHAT KIND OF ROLE WITH THAT PLAY INTO THE OVERRIDING QUESTION IF ANY -- WELL I I MEAN WE THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT IS WE ARE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE WE WE BASICALLY TAKE THE THE LANDSCAPE THE WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAD -- SOME KIND OF DILUTION OF RENT CONTROL -- THAT COULD SEND OUT MORE OF A SIGNAL FLOW WARD TO WARD MORE BUILDING AT CENTER. BUT IT IT DOES SEEM TO BE A NATIONAL PROBLEM THE THE BUILDING PROBLEM THE SHORTAGE OF WORKERS THE THE HIGH COST OF BUILDING A HOME THAT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ANY OTHER PROBLEM QUITE FRANKLY IS THAT -- IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING CALLED A HOUSING OPPORTUNITY INDEX WHICH TAKES A HUNDRED CITIES HUNDRED TWENTY CITIES AROUND THE U. S.. LOOKS AT WHETHER THE MEDIAN FAMILY CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE IN A JURISDICTION WHAT PERCENTAGE OF MEDIAN FAMILIES -- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF HOUSE OF SOUL CAN BE FOR AREA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKE LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO THOSE NUMBERS ARE INCREDIBLY LOW -- SO WE ALREADY HAVE THE EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. SO -- I'D HAVE TO THINK MORE THROUGH THE IMPACT OF SOME KIND OF DILUTION OF RENT CONTROL WHAT IMPACT THAT MIGHT HAVE ON THE SUPPLY PASSES BUT AS I SAID -- CALIFORNIA HOUSE PRICES IT IS -- GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WITH ALMOST OF THE HISTORICAL. NORM AFFORDABILITY -- RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. MR ROSS GOT A QUICK QUESTION WHERE ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA TO ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVENESS. WELL I WOULD SAY -- I'D I'D SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE AREAS OF GROWTH WILL INCLUDE -- SAID THE THE STATE DEVELOPING SERVICE CHECK AROUND THE WORLD SO MEXICO TRYING OR ITS ADDRESS. THE EMERGING MIDDLE CLASS IN THOSE COUNTRIES -- THE SIGNIFICANT áP APPETITE WE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPOSED TOWARD BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THESE COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SERVICES. AND SO -- I I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE AREA THAT WE MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE -- TO TO ENGAGE BETTER AND THEN OF COURSE IN THE IT WORLD -- IT REALLY WE REALLY COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR WHATEVER OF WATER COMES OUT OF THE THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND THE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. JUST A FEW MADAM CHAIR JUST ON THE THE 45% -- INVESTMENT ABROAD THAT THE S. AND P. IS DOING. AND THAT -- STARTS TO LOOK AT THE PROJECTIONS AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS THAT WE SEE. HOW -- HOW VISUAL IT SHOULD WE BE OF KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT IT IS THAT THE -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING AS IS DISCUSSING WORLDWIDE -- DISCUSSIONS WITH DIFFERENT NATIONS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS US. I THINK THERE I THINK IN GENERAL THERE WAS SOME ISSUES -- THE CHALLENGING ISSUES CHINA -- BUT I THINK WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TWO CHASE A STRAW MAN AS FAR AS THAT GOES BECAUSE THE ARRANGEMENT WE HAD WITH CHINA GOING ON SINCE THEIR ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. TWO THOUSAND THREE HAD A LOT OF MUTUALLY. SO -- IF YOU KNOW THE US SUPPLYING -- AS CHINA SUPPLYING. CONSUMPTION -- FOR IMPACTING CORPORATE PROFITS AND AND THEN ALLOWING -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE BETTER PERFORMANCE OF US CORPORATE SECTOR. BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME DOWN SIDES OF THAT YOU KNOW WHICH OR HOLLOWING OUT OF MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN THE U. S. AND SOME OF THE SIX IS THE US BUT THAT'S REALLY BEEN HAPPENING GLOBALLY SO -- THE I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THE ENGAGEMENT -- IF IF US CORPORATIONS ARE -- GOING TO BE HURT BY. THIS AND WE AREN'T GOING TO GET A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES COMING BACK ON SHORE ESSENTIALLY TAX CUTS ARE BEING USED. FOR BUY BACKS AND DIVIDEND NINE SECOND BEING USED TO INCREASE NECESSARILY HIRING -- CAP EX -- THAT'S THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM. SO IS THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OUTCOME BUT WE GET IS BENEFICIAL I THINK TO THE TWO THE TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY PUBLIC FOR THE CORPORATE SECTOR BUT ALSO WE WANT TO SEE. A GREAT A HIRING AS WELL AS A PROBLEM IN THE US ECONOMY IS WE WERE VERY TIGHT ON HIRING ANYWAY. WE HAVE A VERY TIGHT SUPPLY OF LABOR RIGHT NOW SO. I WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE OLD. IN WOOD MIGRATION -- PROGRAMS TO BETTER EDUCATE AMERICANS -- IN ORDER THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO GET A SHIFTING OF SOME PRODUCTION BACK ON SHORE AND THAT THAT IS DONE -- YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT -- WE HAVE SKILLED WORKERS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO BETTER FOCUS I THINK OF THE POLICIES WOULD TO IMPROVE. THE OUTCOMES OF THE ENGAGEMENT WE DOING CHINA. THANK YOU AND RESTORE FINAL QUESTION MADAM CHAIR -- THE HOUSING DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S A THE IMPACT AS FAR AS THE THE MAXIMUM LOAN AMOUNTS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED THROUGH FHA LOAN SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE IMPACTING THE THE OWNERSHIP OF OWNS AND SOME OF THE BUILDING OF THOSE PHONES BECAUSE IT'S OUT PACING SOME TO QUALIFY. FOR THE AMOUNT OF THOSE HOMES ARE. I I I THINK THAT AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN IN -- IN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ITEMS ARE JUSTIFIABLE -- CAN'T A REACTION WHICH IS THAT -- WE GOT INTO A CRAZY LEVERAGE CYCLE WHERE -- THEY WERE THE THERE WAS A LOT OF LENDING GOING ON NOW -- I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHY HOUSING IS BUDGET BEING A MUCH SLOWER. AND THEREFORE MORE COMFORTING -- GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCKS. IN THE CRAZY SOCCER WILL BE HEADING IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS. ONE OF IT IS ACCESSTO LOANS I THINK -- KIND OF TALK TO STAND ITS OWN WHEN. THERE'S ALSO NUMBER A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS AS WELL -- INCLUDING. THE FACT THAT WE ARE CHANGING AT TASTE AWARD MULTI UNIT. LIVING AS OPPOSED TO SINGLE FAMILY -- THAT THAT KIND OF CHANGE THIS IS GOING ON NINE AND ALSO -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE SUB PRIME PRIME. BANKRUPTCIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BASICALLY GOING BACK INTO RENTAL SPACE. SO I THINK THIS A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE OF IT IS PROBABLY IMPEDIMENTS TO LANDING -- BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO AVOID GOING BACK TO THE KIND OF CYCLE WE HAD BACK IN -- I CAN THE ONLY TWO THOUSAND AND AND QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW WE THE CONSUMER SIDE IS IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN WAS IN THE TWO THOUSANDS. THERE ARE POCKETS OF CONCERN LIKE THE OUTSTANDING LEVEL OF STUDENT LOANS WHICH I THINK IS ABOUT ONE FOUR POINT FIVE TRILLION. SO MAYBE SOME POLICY CHANGES AND THEY DID THEIR OF SOME POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS -- WHAT WE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE TO SEE IS -- HOUSING HAVING A BIT OF OUR IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE WE ARE STARTING TO GET HIGH HOUSEHOLD FORMATION. WE ARE STARTING TO GET LOWER INCOME GROUPS BY -- OWNING HOUSES AS OPPOSED TO RENTING SO SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE QUIETLY GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND. THAT I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ECONOMIC CYCLE GOING A FEW MORE YEARS TO ALLOW THAT TO BROADEN OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ROSS FILLED FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY I LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER CAROLINE CHU. WHO IS THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OF STATE AND LOCAL FINANCE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THIS CAPACITY MISS CHIU LEADS THE OFFICE WORK ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY STATE REVENUES OVERALL GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES? PENSIONS AND EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES AMONG OTHERS PREVIOUSLY MYSTERY WORKED AS THE US DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND THE RAND CORPORATION MYSTERY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND PLEASE BEGAN AT YOUR LEISURE -- SO GOOD MORNING THIS MORNING I WAS ALSO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA ANYWAYS SPECIFICALLY AND THEN HOW THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY PLEASE AND THE STATE REVENUES -- SO -- AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. PUNCHES A LITTLE BIT ABOVE ITS WEIGHT IN TERMS OF ITS ECONOMIC OUTPUT COMPARED TO ITS POPULATION ARE WITHIN THE COUNTRY. ABOUT CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS ABOUT 12% ABOUT OF THE NATIONAL POPULATION BUT HAS ABOUT 40% PERCENT -- OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. SO LOOKING CALIFORNIA JOBS THIS CHURCH SHOWS YOU THE UPPER PORTION OF JOBS FIVE SECTOR IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHAT YOU CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS CHART IS THAT JOBS AND HEALTH THEM ARE PRETTY SPREAD OUT ACROSS A VARIETY OF SECTORS THERE REALLY ARE -- A LOT OF ASPECTS -- OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS -- FOCUSED ON ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF I'LL PUT LIKE AGRICULTURE OR OR I. T. WE WE HAVE AN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- STRINGS. THIS CHURCH SHOWS YOU THE PROPORTION OF JOBS IN PARTICULAR SECTORS THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SO. LOOKING AT THIS. AND SEE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF CERTAIN SECTOR JOBS SO I'M SURPRISINGLY CALIFORNIA HAS OVER 50%. OF THE NATION'S JOBS IN MOTION PICTURES SO THAT'S DOWN IN LA AND HOLLYWOOD OF A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE COUNTRY'S AGRICULTURAL JOBS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PREDOMINANTLY -- AND ALSO A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE COUNTRY'S -- ATTACKER I. T. JOBS IN WEB SEARCH AND INTERNET PUBLISHING. OVERALL THOUGH THE STATE ONLY HAS ABOUT 11% OF OF JOBS NATION. SO THIS NEXT CHART -- SHOWS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE FIRST SHOWS THE PROPORTION OF JOBS -- BY AREA IN THE STATES SO AS YOU CAN SEE ALMOST HALF THE STATE'S JOBS ARE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES REGION. AND THEN ABOUT A QUARTER OF JOBS ARE IN THE BAY AREA. IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE NEXT CHART HERE IT SHOWS YOU THE CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULAR SECTORS IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE STATE SO THIS REALLY BREAKS OUT. ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH CERTAIN REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA REALLY HAVE KIND OF A REGIONAL SPECIFIC ECONOMY THAT HAS A PARTICULAR FOCUS. SO IN THE BAY AREA AND THERE IS A HIGHER I. T. AND AND PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL JOBS -- AND THEN IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES REGION WHICH IS REALLY A GOODS HUB FOR THE STATE THERE'S A VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION WAREHOUSING JOBS. UNSURPRISINGLY SACRAMENTO -- HAS A HIGH PROPORTION OF STATE GOVERNMENT JOBS AT ALMOST 25% AND THEN -- THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS OVER HALF THE STATE'S AGRICULTURE JOBS. SO WITH INCOMES IN CALIFORNIA OVERALL CALIFORNIA INCOMES ARE HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. THE MEDIAN INCOMES IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AT LEAST OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT HIGHER NOW. I'M IN CALIFORNIA'S -- HIGH INCOME EARNERS ALSO EARN HIGHER THAN THEIR PEERS ACROSS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIATION ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF INCOME THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THE VARIATION IN INCOME BY REGION AND THEN ALSO BY INCOME GROUP -- SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE BAY AREA HAS THE HIGHEST INCOMES OVERALL IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS -- THE LOWEST INCOMES OF THE REGIONS LISTED HERE YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE SORT OF THE SPREAD OUT MISS. FOR HALF OF A BETTER TERM OF INCOMES THE CHURCHES YOU THE GEN AND THE TOP. 10% OF HOUSEHOLDS SO YOU CAN SEE THE VARIATION BETWEEN THE MEDIAN -- AND THE TOP 10% OF HOUSEHOLDS BY REGION HERE. SO MOVING INTO INCOME AND THEN HOW IT PLAYS INTO THE STATE'S REVENUE IS. THE LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME IN CALIFORNIA ARE WAGES AND SALARIES ALMOST A TRILLION DOLLARS ON THAT'S FOLLOWED BY CAPITAL GAINS OUT OF A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN -- PENSIONS ANNUITIES AND IRA DISTRIBUTIONS AND A HUNDRED AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS. NOW I'M LOOKING AT HOW THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INCOME PLAY IN NEW ON PEOPLE'S EARNINGS THIS CHART MIRRORS THE LAST ONE SO THE BLUE SHE ANSWERED OUR FRIENDLY WAGES AND SALARY AND RETIREMENT. INCOME AND THEN THE ORANGE SHADES ARE CAPITAL GAINS PARTNERSHIP INCOME DIVIDENDS INTEREST AND RENTS WERE YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS CHART IS THAT YOU MOVE AS YOU MOVE UP THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION WE STARTED THE LAST HOME IS -- OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOU CAN SEE THAT THE PROPORTION OF INCOME FROM WAGES TO CLIENTS AS PEOPLE'S INCOMES INCREASES IN THE PROPORTION OF INCOME FROM CAPITAL GAINS. PARTNERSHIP INCOME IN OTHERS REALLY STARTS TO INCREASE. THEN THIS NEXT CHART SHOWS YOU THE VARIATION OR THIS SORT OF VOLATILITY OF INCOME BY INCOME TYPE AND AND WE'LL TALK NEXT ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYS INTO REVENUES -- IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES BUT WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS THAT WE JUST AND SALARIES WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME OVERALL IS RELATIVELY STABLE AND IT'S YOUR TO YOUR GROW THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THE PERCENT CHANGE YEAR OVER YEAR. IN CONTRAST CAPITAL GAINS PARTNERSHIP INCOME THESE ARE VERY VOLATILE AND ANY CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YOUR YOUR AGAIN LOOKING AT THE TOTAL PERCENT CHANGE. SINCE THE NINETIES -- THE LARGER SHARE OF INCOME TIME TO THE THAT TO HIGH INCOME EARNERS THOSE IN AND EIGHTY IF. THOSE EARNING EIGHTY IN THE EIGHTIETH PERCENTILE ON ABOVE. AND AND YOU CAN SEE HERE AGAIN THE PERCENT CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR YOU CAN SEE THE GROWTH ESPECIALLY SINCE THE END OF THE GREAT RECESSION -- IN THE HIGHEST IN THE HIGHEST INCOME EARNERS. SO MOVING TO REVENUES AND WE'LL GET INTO HOW ON THE GROWTH IN THE HAITIAN EARNERS PLAYS INTO THE STATE'S OVERALL REVENUE SYSTEM IN JUST A SECOND -- THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THE DISTRIBUTION OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX SYSTEM SO THERE ARE THREE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES HERE THE FOR THE INNERMOST CIRCLE SHOWS YOU THE SPLIT -- IN TOTAL TAX REVENUE BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF STATE. OF TAX REVENUE GOES THE STATE AND ABOUT ONE THIRD GOES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR THE STATE'S REVENUE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF REVENUE IS THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX WHICH YOU SEE IN IN THE SECOND CONCENTRIC CIRCLE. AND THEN ON IN THE OUTERMOST CIRCLE THOSE -- HI SLICES SHOW YOU THE SOURCES OF THOSE -- OF THOSE REVENUES SO AGAIN PERSONAL INCOME TAXES YOU CAN SEE THE LARGEST OUT ON PORTION OF THAT HIGH IS WAGES AND SALARIES -- AND THEN THEY'RE ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF INCOMES INCOME AND THEN SIMILARLY ON THE CORPORATION TAX AND THE SALES AND USE TAX YOU CAN SEE HOW. THE SOURCES OF THOSE TAX BREAK OUT ACROSS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT -- TYPES OF OF SALES OF GOD. SO SINCE THE NINETIES THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX HAS GROWN MUCH FASTER -- THEN THE SALES AND USE TAX AS WELL AS THE CORPORATION TAX AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS -- INCOME GROWTH AT THE HIGH INCOME AT THE HIGH END OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION IN COMBINATION WITH THE STATE'S PROGRESSIVE RATE STRUCTURE SO WITH HIGH INCOME GROWTH. TO THOSE WHO ARE TAXED AT THE HIGHEST MARGINAL RATES COMES THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. IN CONTRAST TO SALES AND USE TAX IN THE CORPORATION TAX -- HAVE HAVE GROWN MORE SLOWLY. SO TALKING ABOUT THE VOLATILITY IN CALIFORNIA'S -- REVENUES THIS CHART SHOWS YOU THREE BREAK THREE DIFFERENT BREAK OUTS -- OF TAX LIABILITY THE FIRST -- COLUMN SHOWS YOU THE SHARE OF TAX RETURNS BY INCOME GROUP. SO YOU CAN SEE IN THIS FIRST BLUE COLUMN IS THAT THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TAX FILERS OFFERED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ZERO AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME? WHICH IS THE CENTER -- LATER ORANGE COLUMN THAT FALLS MORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DISTRIBUTION IN THE FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST CON THE DARK TAX LIABILITY YOU SURE YOU SEE THAT THE HIGHEST SHARE OF TAX LIABILITY. IS -- FALLING TO THOSE MAKING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS REALLY SHOWS YOU HOW THE STATE'S TAX STRUCTURE IS PROGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF WHO BEARS -- THE OVERALL THE LARGEST SHARE OF THE TAX BURDEN. THIS CHART SHOWS YOU JUST A DIFFERENT A LITTLE BIT A DIFFERENT BREAK OUT IN TERMS OF WHO PAYS. THE LARGEST PORTIONS OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX WHAT DISH SHOWS ESSENTIALLY IS THAT THE BAY AREA HE'S A LARGER PROPORTION OF BEING INCOME TAXES COMPARED TO ITS POPULATION -- THAN ANY OTHER REGION SO THAT THE PLOT OF THE HORIZONTAL AXIS SHOWS YOU THE SHARE OF THE POPULATION AND THE VERTICAL ACTUALLY SHOWS YOU THE PERCENT OF PERSONAL INCOME TAXES PAID. WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE BAY AREA IS ABOUT 20% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION BUT PLEASE -- OVER 35% OF FOLKS OFTEN ASKED WHY ON THE SALES TAX HAS GROWN SLOWER. IN RECENT YEARS AND IN LARGE PARTTHAT'S BECAUSE THE PRICE OF GOODS -- HAS HAS NOT RISEN VERY QUICKLY -- WHERE IS THE PRICE OF SERVICES HAVE -- RISEN NOTABLY SINCE THE EIGHTIES BUT THOSE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SALES TAX ON CONSEQUENTLY THE SHARE OF TAXABLE SALES -- AT IS A SHARE PERSONAL INCOME HAS HAS DECLINED SINCE THAT TIME. LASTLY JUST A COUPLE NOTES ON CORPORATION TAXES ARM WHICH IS THE THIRD LARGEST CATEGORY OF THE STATE'S -- TAX REVENUE. CORPORATION TAXES ARE RELATIVELY CONCENTRATED ON THESE TOP FOR AT LEAST HALF FOUR GROUPS PAY ABOUT SIXTY PER 68% ALMOST 70% OF OVERALL CORPORATION TAX BUT ONLY MAKE UP -- THAT'S MANUFACTURING RETAIL HOLDING COMPANIES AND FINANCIAL COMPANIES. WESLEY JUST ONE NO -- ON CORPORATION TAXES THIS -- SHOWS YOU THE BREAK OUT OF CORPORATION TAX CREDITS WHICH SOME ARE SOME OF THE STATE'S LARGEST TAX CREDITS. SPECIFICALLY THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- TAX CREDIT AT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IT SHOWS YOU THE BREAK OUT. BY INDUSTRY OF OF WHAT CORPORATE. EVE -- DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS OF THAT TAX FRIDAY. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME. THANK YOU MISTER DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FROM THAT ONE JUST FOLLOW UP ON THE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ARE THE FEDERAL. TAX LAW LAST YEAR WHAT HAS THAT DONE WITH RESPECT TO THE YEAH THE CORPORATE DEBT TAXES FOR EXAMPLE THE NUMBER -- ONE DOWN FROM 39% 221% OF THEIR ABOUT HOW THAT IMPACTING CALIFORNIA IS A WHOLE -- SO CALIFORNIA HASN'T TAKE ANY ACTIONS TO CONFORM WITH THE FEDERAL CHANGES IN -- TAXOL EITHER ON THE PERSONAL ORACLE AND THAT SAID BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF BRINGING. BACK HOME WE HAD CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN. SOMEONE OF AN INCREASE IN CORPORATION TAX REVENUE JUST BECAUSE COMPANIES ARE RESPONDING TO TO THAT INCENTIVE SOMEWHAT BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN REALLY AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON REVENUES THAT WE'VE SEEN AS YET THIS YEAR THANKS. A QUESTION -- THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK TO HOW DO YOU SEE THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY. I REALLY IMPACT IN OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH. WELL I THINK. IT DEPENDS IT IN TERMS OF HOW THE STATE. MAKES THAT TRANSITION ULTIMATELY IF THE FOCUS IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA FACES IS. IS -- RELATED TO TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING THAT IS INCREASINGLY PEOPLE LIVE FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM THEIR WORKPLACE -- AND NEED TO COMMUTE TO TO WORK I'M SO THAT THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR WHERE AND HOW CALIFORNIA BILLS HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT THAT. LOW EMISSIONS GOAL. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US TODAY I CERTAINLY BEEN A PLEASURE I KNOW THAT WE MAY HAVE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AFTER TODAY'S HERE IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO JUST TO CONTINUE ON WITH TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- WALK CALIFORNIA'S CLEARLY A DOMINANT PLAYER WITH IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE AND POPULATION GROUPS HAVE NOT EQUITABLY PARTICIPATED IN ITS PROSPERITY. CALIFORNIA'S WORK FOR SERVICE WANTED THE STATE'S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES KEY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO JOIN US TO DISCUSS. THIS -- AND RECOMMENDATIONS AN ANALYSIS FOR USING WORKFORCE IN TRAINING PROGRAMS TO ADVANCE A PROSPEROUS MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY -- IT IS MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME MISTER JIM MAYOR AS OUR FIRST SPEAKER. WITH US THIS MORNING MISTER MAYOR IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CALIFORNIA FORD WHERE HE LEADS OUR EFFORTS TO SUSTAINABLY AND EQUITABLY INCREASE PROSPERITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND MODERNIZE THE PUBLIC'S RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE STATE'S GOVERNMENT THROUGH BY TRANSPARENCY WE HAVE ASKED MISTER MAYOR TO COVER IN ADDITION TO WORK FORCE THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ROADMAP. FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT MISTER MAYOR IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE GETTING. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS INVITATION IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. THAT THE HEADLINE HERE I THINK IS THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA WITH ACTUALLY MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THIS CENTRAL ISSUE ABOUTHOW DO WE SUPPORT PROSPERITY. THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCES INEQUALITY AND POVERTY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY. ANTS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BUT THAT PROGRESS IS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT WE CAN DO. AND WE IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF US INVOLVED IN THE SUMMIT BELIEVE THE TWENTY NINETEEN IS A VERY IMPORTANT YEAR VERY IN. CORN OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE THE SCALE IN THE SPEED AT WHICH WERE MAKING PROGRESS. NOT JUST AGAINST THE NUMBERS WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH NOW IN TERMS OF INCOME INEQUALITY AN OPPORTUNITY. BUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE KNOW WE FACE IN THE FUTURE AS WHETHER IT'S A AYE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION. ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY THAT THE MENTIONED AND SO WE WERE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SETTING UP TO SOLVE TODAY'S PROBLEMS AND SETTING IT UP SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. FASTER BETTER AND CHEAPER GOING FORWARD. I WANNA MAKE THREE MAIN POINTS FROM GATED SUBJECT THAT WHAT YOU'RE TAKING ON TODAY THE FIRST IS THAT. EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE PROSPERITY REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. THAT'S THE SYSTEM SCALE. LEVEL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS WITH A PROGRAM WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE IT WITH A FUNDING SHIFT. IT REALLY TAKES ALL OF THE PIECES COMING TOGETHER. CHANGING FUNDAMENTALLY HOW THESE PROGRAMS AND HOW THESE POLICIES AND HOW THEY STRATEGIES WORK. AND THAT MAY SOUND DON TEAM BUT AGAIN WE'VE BEEN MAKING US HERE THAT SHOWS US WE CAN DO THIS. THE SECOND IS THAT IF WE WANNA TAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO SPEED AND SCALE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORMALIZE OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PARTICULARLY HOW IS IT WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS NOT JUST HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RETURN. THAT'S THE KEY GOVERNANCE CHALLENGE WE'VE GOT. AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT IF WE WANT TO MOVE PAST MARGINAL CHANGES INCREMENTAL CHANGES. AND THIRD TO THE PRECISE FOCUS OF THIS CONVERSATION THERE IS AN URGENCY TO INNOVATE AND TO EMIGRATE AND TO ACCELERATE. ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. SOMEONE SPEND JUST A FEW MINUTES ON EACH OF THOSE. THREE FIRST BY WAY BACKGROUND FOR THOSE OF YOU DON'T KNOW CALIFORNIA FORWARD MANAGES BUT WE'RE JUST THE MANAGER. OF THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT ON BEHALF OF WITH. THE WHOLE SET OF REGIONAL CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS -- UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE CALIFORNIA STORES AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR IN A FEW MINUTES FROM PAGANI OF THE CEO OF THE INLAND EMPIRE. ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ONE OF THOSE REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OVER THE EIGHT YEARS THAT THE SUMMIT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH ATTRACTED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ASSOCIATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LEADERS. THAT HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON THEY WANT TO WORK CROSS SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR SAID SIX ACTOR. THEY REALIZE WE HAVE DISTINCT REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND THEY WANT TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE REGIONAL SCALE TO REDUCE. INEQUALITY AND TO GROW PROSPERITY AND JOBS AND CONNECTEDNESS AND THEN TO CONNECT THAT ACROSS THE REGION'S AND WITH THE STATE. AND THIRD THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT TRYING TO FIND TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS. SIMULTANEOUSLY ADVANCING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WAYS THAT ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF INEQUALITY AND INCREASE OUR SUSTAINABILITY RESILIENCY THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF WE DON'T GET THERE BY SACRIFICING ONE FOR THE OTHER. WE'RE NOT GONNA START WITH NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE CLIMATE CHANGE IF IT HAD IF IT HAPPENS THAT THE CONSEQUENCE. OF JOBS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND A STRUGGLE BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT THESE GROUPS TOGETHER OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS EVERY YEAR THERE IS A SUMMIT LAST YEAR WAS IN SANTA ROSA. THIS NOVEMBER IT WILL BE IN FRESNO -- EVERY YEAR PEOPLE COME TOGETHER THEY ACTUALLY WORK THROUGH TWO AND A HALF DAYS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THEY WANT. TO PRIORITIZE IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THEY PRODUCE A DOCUMENT CALLED THE ROADMAP TO SHARE PROSPERITY WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET. SO EVERY YEAR THERE IS A OF A NEW ROADMAP THAT SAYS HERE'S WHAT WE'VE MADE PROGRESS HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO WORK IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND THEN THEY WORK ON IT ALL YEAR LONG THIS IS A SO THIS WHERE EVERYBODY COMES TOGETHER FIVE HUNDRED OR SO LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE IN ONE PLACE AT ONE TIME. BUT ALL YEAR LONG LITERALLY HUNDREDS. OF ADVOCATES EXPERTS AND OTHERS ARE WORKING TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE THAT ROADMAP TO SHARE PROSPERITY IN DEEP PARTNERSHIP WITH GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS. LOOK AT THAT ROAD MAP IT IS ED INCLUDED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR COURT CHALLENGES. AND THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MORE MINUTE ONE MILLION MORE. MIDDLE INCOME JOBS. THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MILLION MORE AT LEAST SKILLED WORKERS. THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MILLION MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES AND THE NEED TO CREATE ONE MORE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER EACH YEAR FOR TEN YEARS IN ORDER TO BRING OUR WATER SUPPLY TO BALANCE. WE KNOW THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE GONNA MOVE A LITTLE BIT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE DID SOME ANALYSIS WITH MACKENZIE WHO CAME OUT WITH NEED ONE MILLION MARK AFFORDABLE JOBS WE NEED THREE POINT FIVE MILLION MORE AFFORDABLE JOBS. YOU MAY HAVE MADE HERE THAT FROM THE GOVERNOR NOW THAT'S WHERE THAT NUMBER CAME FROM FROM THE GOVERNOR'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN SOME OTHER ELEMENTS ADDED TO THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS OUR WORK AGAIN THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED WE NEW THAT EVEN IF WE COULD MEET THE METRIC OF THOSE MILLION CHALLENGES. WE WORK ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IN FACT THAT WORKFORCE PIPELINE IF YOU LIKE THAT TERM BEGINS AT BIRTH. RIGHT WE KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS LARGELY INFLUENCED SCIENCE WILL TELL US THAT WE CAN DO THE ECONOMICS. SO OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THE FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BECOME INVOLVED IN THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT SO THAT THEY CAN START TALKING TO THEIR BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. ABOUT THE END OF PORTENTS NOT ONLY OF THOSE EARLY LEARNING INVESTMENTS IN LONG TERM ECONOMIC PROSPERITY BUT HOW DO WE STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZE THOSE SO THAT WE GET BETTER RETURNS ON THAT INVESTMENT. SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM BUT IT'S A MORE ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY IN A BETTER SYSTEM THAT GETS US THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED. IF WHAT WE NEED IS IS ALL CALIFORNIANS TO BE CAPABLE OF DOING THEIR BEST IN THE FUTURE. UP. AS AS A AS WAS REFERENCED IN THE QUESTION AROUND HOUSING THE COST OF SO MUCH MORE POVERTY PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN. BY THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPACE WITH ENGAGE A LOT OF THOSE LEADERS OVER THE YEARS. ON HOW IS IT WE CAN BRING TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY AND REDUCE THE COSTS OF HOUSING AND I CAN WE CAN PROVIDE LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON THAT -- THIS LAST YEAR WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT -- ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IN TERMS OF LONG COMMUTES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING PUTTING TOGETHER TO MINIMUM WAGE JOBS IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET. ACTUALLY IMPACTS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS AND SO THIS YEAR WE'RE DOING AN OVERLAY ON HOW THIS IMPACTS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH -- IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT A TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE WE WANT A MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY IN THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. AND FINALLY -- A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE I THINK THERE IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE IS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH WORLD COMMUNITIES WITH IN CALIFORNIA. TO IDENTIFYWHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SIMULTANEOUSLY RESPOND TO THE WHAT GREAT INCREASING WILDFIRE THREATS. TO REDUCE THOSE HAZARDS TO BETTER MANAGE THE FOREST BOTH FOR THIS FOR THE SAKE OF A WILDFIRE IN FOR THE SAKE OF OUR OF OF WATER SYSTEMS AND AND AND AND WATERSHEDS BEING MANAGE BETTER IN A TIME OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BY IN FACT RECREATING WOULD THE SUSTAINABLE AND SUPPORT THAT -- THERE'S A LOTS OF INTEREST INTEREST IN THAT THERE'S LOTS OF ACTIVITY CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN THE SUMMIT IS INVOLVED IN THAT -- BUT THAT'S THE THROUGH PUT -- THAT REALLY COULD BE A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT. SO MY SECOND POINT THAT IF IF WE WANT TO ACCELERATE THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING WE NEED. TO FORMALIZE OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE -- IN AND THIS CAN THIS IS A LONGER CONVERSATION AND IS THE SUBJECT OF SOME THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED YOU WANT TO TAKE ON AND SO -- THE SUMMIT IS -- HAPPY TO OFFER OURSELVES AS A RESOURCE AND A PARTNER IN FIGURING THESE THINGS OUT SO AB -- NINE OH SIX BY THE CHAIR WOMAN AND SOME OTHER MEMBERS OUTLINES -- A PROPOSAL AND PUT PUT FORTH PROPOSAL FOR HOW THE STATE COULD GO ABOUT INTEGRATING WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DOING. DOING THE EVALUATION OF WHAT ELSE WE NEED TO DO AND THEN COMING UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT WE CAN PURSUE AN EMPLOYMENT -- AND IT'S A VERY GOOD STARTING POINT IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE SUMMIT HAS SUPPORTED PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND WERE EAGER TO ENGAGE. IN THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE SUMMIT ON ITS OWN HAS INITIATED THIS YEAR WORK ACROSS ITS REGION'S TO PUT TOGETHER -- A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL OF EXISTING PLANNING EFFORTS GOOD AGGREGATED AND BUILT UP SO THAT WHATEVER THE STATE DOES IT'S TRULY IN RESPONSE TO REGIONAL NEEDS -- WE'VE ALSO GOT ANOTHER WORK GROUP THAT SAYS IF IF THIS SOME KIND OF STRUCTURE WHERE THE STATE IS CONSULTING WITH THE REGION'S THE STATUS AND DEVELOPING A PLAN THIS IS ABOUT COMING UP WITH A PLAN THIS IS ABOUT COMING UP WITH ON GOING. PROCESS PLANTS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO BE MOVING THIS FORWARD ON AT THREE SIXTY FIVE DAY BASIS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY ORGANIZING STRUCTURE THAT SO. WE'RE DOING OUR HOMEWORK ON HOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY ORGANIZING STRUCTURE THAT ONLY TO OFFER THAT IS A RESOURCE FOR YOU AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR LEGISLATION -- WE ALSO IN THE LAST YEAR -- WHEN WE WHEN WE GET DONE WITH THE SUMMIT THAT COOK FORMER CULTURE OF CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND CULTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT -- LEMON DON SAID -- ACCEPTED A REQUEST BY THE GOVERNOR TO BECOME HIS LEAD. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR AND AND MISTER MADONNA HAS AGREED TO TAKE THAT ON FOR A LIMITED TIME IN PART BECAUSE HE WANTS TO TAKE THE THINKING THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING BY THESE HUNDREDS OF LEADERS. AND WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE HERE TO ACTUALLY FIND A WAY TO FORMALIZE THAT AND BRING IT INTO PLACE SO THE TICKET SO THAT THE AGENCIES. THAT NEED TO COOPERATE ARE COOPERATING AND WHERE WE FIND WHERE THERE'S FRICTION POINTS WE HAVE A SYSTEM WITHIN THE STATE THAT CAN RESOLVE THOSE. SO. THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE THIS GOVERNANCE ELEMENTS SO WE'RE GETTING NOT JUST BETTER IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS ARE STRATEGIES BUT BETTER AND HOW IT TURNS WE MANAGE GOVERNMENT OVERSEE THIS. TO THAT END ONE FINAL ELEMENT ON THIS SECOND POINT -- OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT. THE SUMMIT DEVELOP WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA DREAMIN TAX WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE WE SAID WE WERE ALL IMPRESSED BY THIS IDEA THAT A FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE PUT OUT A METRIC WE WANT TO REDUCE CARBON. EMISSIONS BY AXE AND IT DROVE POLICY IT DROVE INNOVATION IT DROVE AMBITION AND DROVE IDEAS AND IT DROVE INVESTMENT -- AND WE SAID WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME EXACT THING FOR INCOME INEQUALITY UPWARD MOBILITY ECONOMIC SECURITY -- AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AROUND WE REALIZED BELIEVE IT OR NOT OF ALL THE DASHBOARDS OF ALL THE INDICATORS WE ACTUALLY DON'T MEASURE THOSE WE DON'T MEASURE THOSE IN WAYS THAT ARE PREDICATED BACK. ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE ROUTE DRIVERS OF THOSE INCLUDING HEALTH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND AVAILABILITY OF JOBS AND SO WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROTOTYPE FOR HOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY MEASURE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S NOT YET TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE WE NEED TO GET IT THERE BUT I WANT I WANT TO SUGGEST AS YOU CONSIDER YOUR OWN IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO FORMALIZE OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. PLEASE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY HOW ARE WE GONNA MEASURE THIS. IN A IN AB NINE OH SIX AND YOU'RE IN THE FIRST DRAFT HERE THAT WAS SUBMITTED JUST A WEEK AGO IT CALLS OUT FOR TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE SOLUTIONS WHICH WOULD SUGGEST WHEN YOU TROUBLE BOTTOM LINE METRICS. SO FINDING A THIRD AND I WANT TO TOUCH JUST UP FOR A COUPLE MINUTES ON THIS IDEA THAT. THERE HAS TO BE AN URGENCY TO INNOVATE AND A GREAT AND ACCELERATE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- IT DID CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN THE SUMMIT HAS BEEN GREATLY INVOLVED IN THIS WORKING WITH MISTER LANDER AND HIS TEAM WORKING WITH THE EDGE COALITION THERE'S LOTS OF ENERGY AND GOOD PROGRESS THAT IS BEING MADE BOTH ON IMPROVING THE WORKFORCE. PIPELINE CONNECTING THE VARIOUS SILOS WITHIN THE WORKFORCE WORLD COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE A KEY ELEMENT TO THIS AND I'VE BEEN REALLY AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS -- BUT WHAT WE'VE REALLY DISCOVERED AS WE IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT IN REALLY MEANINGFUL WAYS HOW TO IMPROVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND THIS AND THE STRUCTURE. AND IT'S GOT TO BE MUCH DEEPER THAN AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE IT'S GOT TO BE MUCH THE DEEPER THAN OCCASIONAL CONSULTATION -- AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WERE YOU SEE THE GREATEST GAINS THEY ARE WORKING A DEEP PARTNERSHIP TO UNDER DANCE UNDERSTAND THE SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED TO DO VERY TARGETED REMEDIAL EDUCATION -- TO THEN PROVIDE THE TRAINING THAT'S NEEDED TO GET PEOPLE INTO JOBS THAT PAY WELL WITH BENEFITS AND THEN MOVE ON UP THE CAREER LADDER. AND NOT ONLY IS THAT FIGHT AND WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE PIPELINES BEGAN WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE DISCONNECTED USE AND THE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T SHOWING UP A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOORS THEY'RE NOT SHOWING UP AT WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS. THE MOST EXCITING PROJECTS ARE WE'RE GOOD WILL OR SOME OTHER COMMUNITY -- ENTITY IS DRIVING IS THAT IS THE FRONT END OF THAT PIPELINE. THIS IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT AGAIN TO REMEDY THIS CHALLENGE WE HAVE AROUND FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS MAKING A MINIMUM WAGE AND IT TAKES TO MINIMUM WAGE IN THE CHEAPEST PARTS OF THE STATE TO PAY RENT -- BUT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO ALLOW US TO ADAPT THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA KNOW THE IMPACT OF A I REALLY EMPLOYERS THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA KNOW THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL TRADE. IS GOING TO BE THE EMPLOYERS IF WARRANTY PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM OR ABILITY TO RESPOND IS GOING TO BE MUCH FASTER MUCH GREATER -- AND DISK AND THIS GOES MUCH BEYOND KIND OF MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS ARE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING THIS APPLIES TO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING -- ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND WE STARTED TO BUILD THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THIS AND THE GOVERNOR IS PUT. SOME MONEY ON THE TABLE TO DO DATA INFRASTRUCTURE SO ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ROLE WHAT IS THE DECISIONS WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BE MAKING WITH THE DATA THAT COMES OUT OF THIS. AND ONE OF OUR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD BE HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW HOW AFFECTED THESE PARTNERSHIPS REALLY ARE. AND HOW AND AND WHAT ARE THE DECISIONS THAT EMPLOYERS IN ORDER FOR THEMSELVES TO BE PREPARED AND RESILIENT. SECOND WITH THEM UNDER THIS IDEA OF OF PARTNERSHIP -- WE NEED TO THINK VERY CLEARLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE EXISTING FINANCIAL AID AND TRAINING FUNDING AND TURN IT INTO A REALLY NIMBLE INTEGRATED IN COHERENT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT LIFELONG LEARNING -- WE STARTED A WORK GROUP TO WORK ON THAT THERE'S SOME BILLS THIS YEAR THAT ARE MOVING THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAS PUT FORTH. A BILL -- BY -- SENATOR LEYVA SB TWO NINETY ONE THAT WOULD BEGIN TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR CAL GRANT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE ALREADY WORKING ON WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS HELP YOU BLUE SKY WHAT IS THIS REALLY LOOK LIKE. WHEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT LIFE LONG LEARNING FOR ALL OF MY LIFE BUT GUESS WHAT NOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS WILL PEOPLE ARE GETTING SKILLED UP WHETHER STILL EMPLOYED BEFORE THEY'RE LAID OFF BEFORE THE I. A. TELLS THEM WHAT TO DO? AND AND IN OUR GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE C. WEB AND AND WITH -- REGIONAL WEBS. THEY UNDERSTAND THIS THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT SOLUTION AND WE WANT TO HELP DO THAT AND FINALLY THE LAST POINT. IS -- WE REALLY THERE'S A LOT -- INVOLUNTARY FREELANCE WORKERS ARE HOURLY WORKERS ARE GET WORKERS -- THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PROFESSIONAL AND THEY WANT TO MOVE THEIR LIVES IN THAT WAY THEY WANT TO CONTROL THEIR PORTFOLIO WORK BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT -- SO WE STARTED A GROUP LAST YEAR TO DO SOME DISCUSSIONS -- THE LONG BEACH WHERE THAN SOME OTHERS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FRAMING UP WHAT THAT REALLY COULD LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN EMPOWER WORKERS IN THE MARKET PLACE IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE STRUCTURE CO OPS ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY EMPOWER WORKERS. AND GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS -- STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS CREATING A COMMISSION ON CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE IN THE FUTURE OF WORK TO WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO -- DOES SOME IT WILL WANT TO CONTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY WE CAN TO THAT CONVERSATION -- WE THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT BLEAK THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO EMPOWER ALL CALIFORNIANS -- TO REALLY OWN ON THAT THEIR CAREERS AND BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC SECURITY IF WE GET THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL COMPACT AND UPDATE INTO TODAY'S TRENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH I MISTER MAYOR IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IF WE CAN CONTINUE ON WITH THE NEXT SPEAKER -- BUT THAT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF ALL THE PANELISTS -- OF OF THIS SECTION. THE NEXT SPEAKER WE HAVE ENTER EXECUTOR FOR YOUR WORK FORCE ASSOCIATION MISTER LANTERNS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND NONPROFIT INDUSTRY. HAVING PREVIOUSLY LED LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS INSERTED IN THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING ADMINISTRATION. THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS NETWORKS OF LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS AND THEIR PARTNERS WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER LANTERN. I THANK YOU CHAIR CERVANTES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY TO SHARE A COUPLE OF EFFORTS WE HAVE GOING UNDER WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THAT I MISTER MAYOR MADE. JUST A MINUTE AGO -- REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TALKING TO YOU AT A TIME SUCH AS THIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR CURRENT STATE OF OUR ECONOMY. THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING YOU HEARD THAT EARLIER THIS MORNING UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE DOWN UP AND DOWN THE STATE -- AND IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REALLY A FACT EQUITY ISSUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHILE THERE IS GOOD NEWS ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT US -- CURRENTLY WE HAVE SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA TWO AND A HALF MILLION OF THEM ARE SET TO RETIRE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THAT'S TRUE 16% OF OUR POPULATION STILL LIVE AT OR BELOW POVERTY AND THAT INCLUDES TWO POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN THAT IS A TIME OF YOUNG. KIDS EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FAMILIES EARN LESS THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. ARE CAREER CENTERS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED WE HAVE A NETWORK OF ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY CAREER CENTERS -- THROUGH THE WORK FOR SPORTS IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR WE SAW ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS CAREER CENTERS. MOST ALL OF THEM CLOSE TO EIGHTY FIVE IT'S WILL BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. THESE CHALLENGES NOT ONLY AFFECT OUR CITIZENS BUT THEY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES AS WELL -- ESTIMATES ARE THAT WE WILL NEED FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS BY. TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND THAT THE COST OF ON FILL JOB OPENINGS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA IS FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TALENT SO WHERE IS THE TOWN. WILL THE TALENT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY LIES IN TWO AREAS TARGETED POPULATIONS AS WE LIKE TO CALL THEM -- EXPLAIN IS SECOND. AND YOUTH YOUNG PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL. FIRST I WANT TO SAYTHAT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION AND OUR PARTNERS AND OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THE EQUITY ISSUES BOTH THE SKILLS GAP. AND MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY LAST YEAR WITH. YOUR HELP WITH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S HELP THE HELP OF THIS COMMITTEE THE GOVERNOR AND MANY OF OUR PARTNERS ARE ON THE TABLE -- WE SPONSORED LEGISLATION CALLED THE BREAKING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVE AND ULTIMATELY FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED OF THE GENERAL FUND. TO HELP AND TARGETED AT TO HELP TARGET POPULATIONS. THIS IS REALLY MET TO TARGETED FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NOT THE TAXED TO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES OVER THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS INVESTING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. INVESTING IN K. TWELVE INVESTING IN HIGH A HUGE PART OF OUR POPULATION THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY ATTACHED AND ABLE -- TO TO TO BENEFIT FROM ANY OF THAT INVESTMENT SO THIS -- THIS IDEA IS REALLY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS IN OUR OPINION IT PAIRS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS -- TOGETHER TO REACH OUT TO WEAR THESE INDIVIDUALS FOSTER YOU HOMELESS DISABLED POPULATION ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS WHERE THEY LIVE THE CBO'S HAVE THEIR CULTURAL COMPETENCIES THEY HAVE THOSE. THE TRUST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE IDEA IS THAT THE CBO'S WOULD BRING THEM INTO THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM WORKING WITH WORKFORCE BOARD WE WOULD REMEDIATE THEIR LIFE SKILLS AND EDUCATION SKILLS. WORKING WITH ADULT EDUCATION SYSTEM WHEN WHEN NECESSARY. TO MOVE THEM INTO ONE OF THREE OUTCOMES -- ENROLLMENT IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION. ENROLLMENT IN -- INTEREST IN THE CRYPT HALFWAY JOBS AND THE THIRD WOULD BE INTERESTED TO PRE APPRENTICESHIP AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THAT PROGRAM IS OFF AND RUNNING WE'VE JUST CONCLUDED FIVE FORMS ARE ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR INTRODUCING -- AB ELEVEN ELEVEN THE BREAKING BARRIERS INITIATIVE TO THE COMMUNITY OF CALIFORNIA. HAVING GREAT QUESTIONS COME FROM PRIMARILY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT THE RULES -- AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THIS INITIATIVE THAT MONEY WILL HIT THE STREETS IN THE SPRING AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO COMING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND SHARING INCREDIBLE RESULTS -- WITH THIS EFFORT -- FIFTY MILLION EMPHASIZE START. OKAY SECOND APPRENTICESHIP SO. CALIFORNIA AS WE KNOW IS THE DRIVING. FOR THE DRIVING FORCE OF OUR ECONOMY IS INNOVATION. WE ARE STILL THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN. HOWEVER THERE IS A MISMATCH THE TYPE OF TALENT THAT'S NEEDED AND DEMAND THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM EMPLOYERS AND THE TYPE OF SUPPLY THAT'S CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. WE CAN WORK TO FILL THE CURRENT -- NEED -- BY MOVING PEOPLE QUICKLY IN THE JOBS BUT THERE'S A BIGGER CHALLENGE AND THAT'S THE PIPELINE TO THE FUTURE FIVE TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW. WHERE WE GONNA FIND THAT TALENT IN OUR NATION'S HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM IN OUR STATE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM? THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN WITH THE STATE WORKFORCE SPORT HAS A PLAN FOR DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF APPRENTICES. BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN GOVERNOR NEWSOME. HAS UPPED THE ANTE CALLING FOR AN INCREASE IN NEARLY 5100% AN APPRENTICESHIP TO THE TUNE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE STATE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND APPRENTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 86% OF THOSE EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND ARE IN THE BUILDING TRADES AND FIRE FIGHTING. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. IT AFFECTS OUR YOUNG PEOPLE -- A DISAPPEAR DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP IN CALIFORNIA IS MICROSCOPIC POINT ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD. CALIFORNIA IS THE GLOBAL LEADER IN THE AVERAGE WEIGHT AVERAGE AGE OF A PRESS IS. AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF A PRICE IN CALIFORNIA IS TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD -- THAT IS QUITE OLD FOR AN APPRENTICE AND THAT HAS SOME ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS. WE KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED NINTH GRADERS THAT ENTER HIGH SCHOOL SEVENTY FOUR GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL ON TIME. FORTY FIVE OF THOSE HUNDRED START CALLER BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO EARNED A DEGREE AFTER SIX YEARS. AND ULTIMATELY ONLY TWELVE OF THE HUNDRED NINTH GRADERS ARE IN A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. THE AVERAGE TIME THAT IT TAKES A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE TO LAUNCH A CAREER. IS SEVEN YEARS. THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD BEFORE THEY FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THOSE YOU'D END UP OUR OPPORTUNITY YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND OF THEM STRONG. I HAVE TO LIVING WITH ME RIGHT NOW. SO. I LET ME JUST SAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU LOOK AT IF YOU LOOK AT IT WE HONOR COLLEGE AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT WE HONOR COLLEGE FOR ALL BUT I THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE. TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IF YOU GOOGLE RIGHT NOW AND I JUST DID THIS THE OTHER NIGHT FOR PRESENTATION I'M DOING ON THE FUTURE OF WORK. IF YOU GOOGLE CAREER NIGHT HIGH SCHOOL CAREER NIGHT. AND YOU LOOK AT THE FLYERS AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY ADVERTISE IT'S ALL ABOUT COLLEGE PREP. I JUST RECENTLY ATTENDED A CAREER NIGHT AT MY SON'S SCHOOL. SIXTY BOOTHS TO VOCATIONS MOST ALL OF THEM WERE COLLEGES FROM HAWAII. TO NEW YORK CITY -- SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SHIFT THE SCRIPT ON WHAT IT MEANS ON HOW WE HONOR WORK WITHIN OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. YEAH I'M THE THING ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP THAT'S SO GREAT. AS IF WE GET HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN A BIG WAY INTO THE WORLD OF WORK IT BENEFITS INDUSTRY DRAMATICALLY IT'S MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE TO HIRE AN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN YEAR OLD. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS MUCH GREATER FOR BUSINESS THAN IT IS TO HIRE A TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD WITH THE FAMILY AND A HOUSE AND A CAR PAYMENT X. ADDRESS -- STUDIES WILL SHOW THAT OUR ALLY ON YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP -- WILL RETURN INVESTMENT BACK TO THE EMPLOYER IN YEAR THREE OF AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND THEY'RE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW IN COLORADO. JUST A COUPLE MORE POINTS ON THAT. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT GOING ON AN APPRENTICESHIP TODAY -- WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA APPRENTICESHIP INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN ROLLING UNDER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK UNDER ET P. -- WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK WORK WITH LINK LEARNING IN DUAL CREDIT BUT IT'S ALL VERY DESPERATE IT'S ALL VERY ON CONNECTED WE DO NOT HAVE A SYSTEM. THAT REALLY ALLOWS HIGH SCHOOLS AND INTO WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO WORK. IF WE APPLY HE SWISS MODEL IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT SWITZERLAND -- WE RUN SOME NUMBERS CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND APPRENTICES. BUSINESSES WOULD INVEST ABOUT EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. THE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD EARN TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS -- SKEWS ME THE BUSINESSES WOULD EARN TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS BACK ON THEIR INVESTMENT. YOUNG PEOPLE ASK ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION IN CONSUMER SPENDING AND THIS I THINK IS A CRITICAL THING STUDENT DEBT WOULD BE REDUCED BY ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION RIGHT. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND. THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH -- OUR PARTNERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE BOTH LOCALLY REGIONALLY AND STATEWIDE. ARE WORKING TO ADVANCE A YOUTH POLICY INFRASTRUCTURE A YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP POLICY INFRASTRUCTURE. A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS GOVERNANCE WE RECOMMEND. THAT A GOVERNOR FACILITATED BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION LED BY EXPERTS FROM BUSINESS AND EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BE WELL VERSED IN THE MODERN APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. WE RECOMMEND POLICY ALIGNMENT BE REALLY -- SCRUTINIZE SO WE CAN TRANSITION FROM A SET OF PARALLEL A COMPETING PROGRAMS. TO A SINGLE WELL ARTICULATED SYSTEM AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE CONDUCTING A LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE YOUNG PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL WORKING. THE ADDITION TO HIGH SCHOOL DESIGN WAIT OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO MOVE OUR FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND OPPORTUNITY YOU INTO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. TO SECURE SUSTAINABLE FINANCING FOR SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY INSTRUCTION BUILDING UPON THE RECENT BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- POLICYMAKERS ADDRESS LAST YEAR WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT THAT AND THEN DESIGNING SUSTAINABLE FINANCING MODEL FOR INTERMEDIARIES. WE WILL LOOK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS TO CREATE GUIDELINES FOR STREAMLINED ONLINE REGISTRATION PROCESS. THAT IS THAT IS A SHAREABLE REPOSITORY THAT INCLUDES A SHAREABLE REPOSITORY OF CURRICULA FOR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. WE RECOMMEND THAT WE WORK TODAY TO CONTINUE THE WORK AROUND EDUCATIONAL ALIGNMENT THAT ALLOWS WILL DO ALL CREDIT BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR CREDIT ELECTIVE OR OTHERWISE FOR WORKING. LASTLY PREPARE AN OUT REACH AWARENESS AND COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN. THAT ENGAGES THE PUBLIC AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF WORK. AND THE VALUE OF WORK OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS -- I JUST LOOK AT SOME FIGURES IN WORK TODAY 19% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WORK. PARENTS ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANT THE KIDS TO GO TO COLLEGE I'M NO EXCEPTION -- BUT I THINK WHEN A YOUNG PERSON SAYS MOM DAD I WANT TO WORK IN THE REFINERIES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY ABSOLUTELY. LET'S HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND LASTLY THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOPED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE PERMEABLE WHICH MEANS A YOUNG PERSON WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. CAN AUTOMATICALLY ENTER INTO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION -- WHEN THEY GRADUATE WITH THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE PROGRAM AND ALLOW THEM ENTRANCE INTO THE CSU SYSTEM? THE FUTURE WORK IS HERE WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK. AND FROM OUR MONEY. WE NEED TO BE ARCHITECTS OF THE FUTURE NOT VICTIMS OF THE FUTURE THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER LANDER I SAW. IT SO THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS AFTER THIS I CERTAINLY WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH ON A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT LET ME GO HEAD TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER -- MISS RUNNER SURE REEF -- RONA WORK FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE WHERE SHE SERVED AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH MANAGING ISSUES. RELATED TO EDUCATION OF WORK FORCE LABOR AND PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT POLICY AS SHE NOW SERVES AS THE CO DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA AGE COALITION WHICH IS A COALITION OF BUSINESS LABOR SOCIAL JUSTICE EDUCATION. AND WORKFORCE ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY FOCUS ON CLOSING THE SKILLS AND EQUITY GAP IN CALIFORNIA. GO HEAD AND BEGAN. GOOD MORNING I'M RHONDA SHEAR FROM CO DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA IT'S COALITION SO WE DON'T DESPAIR COALITION IS AN UNUSUAL COLLECTION OF PARTNERS WHO. RARELY AGREE ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THEY WE THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF CLOSING. THOUGH THE SKILL GAP THE EQUITY GAP. IN CALIFORNIA AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES AND THEIR WORK FORCE NEEDS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM GIVE YOU A CALIFORNIA WE'RE NINE MEMBERS -- OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FED THE CAREER LADDERS PROJECT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THAT LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE POLICY LINK THE STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL AND YOU NEED AS YOU S. WHICH IS THE CURRENT NAME HE USED TO BE NATIONAL COUNCIL RAZA WHICH MIGHT BE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE CHANGE THEIR NAME. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE ENGAGE IN EDUCATION ADVOCACY AND COALITION BUILDING AROUND WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING POLICY AND INVESTMENTS TO MOVE PEOPLE THEM. CAREER PATHWAYS AND SUSTAIN A MIDDLE CLASS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS -- IN THE WORLD IN THE AREA OF EDUCATION WE DO POLICY MAKER BRING THINGS AROUND KEY TOPICS. WE WERE YOU KNOW WE DO RESEARCH PAPERS ARE SHORT BRIEFING PAPERS -- WE WE SUPPORT BILLS AND LEGISLATION SO IF YOU HAVE THAT LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA COME TO US BECAUSE WE WERE YOU KNOW WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE THIS. AMAZING COALITION OF UNLIKELY PARTNERS THAT ADD YOU KNOW ED VOICE TO JUST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. AND WE'RE ALSO ENGAGED IN COALITION BUILDING -- AROUND THE STATE NOW YOU. YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS YOU HEARD FROM THE BURKE OR CO PANELISTS HERE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SO WE'RE REALLY -- THAT WE WERE SAYING THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW -- NEARLY. 25% OF OUR WORK FORCE OF FIVE MILLION PEOPLE MAKE LESS THAN FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING. NOT ONE JOB WITH MANY JOBS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOUSING AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE CALIFORNIA IT CAN BE CONSIDERED THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN. YOU KNOW IN THE NATION ANY STATE IN THE NATION. AS I SAID MANY OF THEM ALL YOUR WHOLE MULTIPLE JOBS SO THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME TO TO TO GO AND GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND TO GET TRAINING AND LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS TO MOVE UP. A CAREER PIPELINE. MANY MORE INDIVIDUALS WE HEARD ABOUT THEM ESPECIALLY FROM C. WA FACED A LOT OF BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT I MEAN THEY HAVE BASICALLY WITH LIMITED ENGLISH AND MATH SKILLS THEY HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS. THEY HAVE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND REALLY LIMITED EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE OF MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO OBTAIN JOBS. WE HEAR THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAVE CRITICAL SHORTAGES OF OF MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS I MEAN TO INDUSTRIES A PARTICULAR THAT WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER -- ARE THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY I THINK WE ALSO THINK THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AND AND MANY OTHERS FACE THOSE CONSTRAINTS SO WE HAVE. PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED. TO GET INTO THE PIPELINE AND MOVE UP THE PIPELINE AND EMPLOYERS WHO REALLY ARE EXPERIENCING GAPS IN THE WORKFORCE -- SO -- IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE CANCEL. WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW AS PART OF OUR COALITION BUILDING EFFORTS AS WE ARE -- CASH. YESTERDAY AND TODAY WE ARE COULD BE ANYONE I'M CALLING OUR FIRST ANNUAL SKILLS FOR CALIFORNIA SUMMIT. WE HAD -- YESTERDAY WE HAD OVER THE BASED ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL WORK FORCE BOARDS COMMUNITYCOLLEGE ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATES -- A FOLKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE COMING TO TO SACRAMENTO TO TALK ABOUT A SERIES OF POLICY ISSUES THE TWO GENTLEMEN HERE AT THE TABLE WHERE THEY ARE. AND TODAY OVER SIXTY OF THOSE -- INDIVIDUALS WILL BE MEETING WITH WITH FOLKS OVER IN THE CAPITAL WE HAVE BEATING SET UP TO ADVOCATE FIRST SERIES OF POLICY ACTIONS THAT WE THINK WILL ADD WILL CREATE BETTER PATHWAYS FOR FOLKS. AND GREATER -- PROSPERITY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES SO I'M JUST GOING TO QUICKLY TOUCH ON THE THREE THINGS THAT THEY WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR IS THE AS AS OUR TEAMS OF OF FOLKS ABOUT THE DOWN THE STATE MEET WITH -- PEOPLE MAYBE IN YOUR OFFICES I HOPE -- TO TALK ABOUT -- STRATEGIES ONE IS AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IT ALREADY IT'S ABOUT MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. A RECENT STUDY BY TEAK IS WHICH IS THE IS FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY -- CAME OUT WITH A LOOKED AT THE COST OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE AND FOUND MUCH TO THE SURPRISE OF MANY OF US. THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU TAKE WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T GET -- THEY DON'T GET EIGHT EIGHT INSTITUTIONAL AID WHICH YOU GET IT AT C. ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE SO. EVEN THOUGH THE TUITION IS LOW THE NET COST IS VERY EXPENSIVE THERE'LL BE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS MENTION THAT THERE WILL BE A BILL -- AROUND FINANCIAL AID -- FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THE SENATE'S AND LEYVA THAT WILL KIND OF CHANGE THE WAY -- THE WAY OVER THE AWARD LEVELS AND WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR FOR BENEFITS WE THINK THAT THAT EFFORT AND MANY OTHER EFFORTS BUT THAT THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE WILL BE CONSIDERING THIS YEAR VERY IMPORTANT WE WE REALLY BELIEVE IN WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR WE THINKING HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE. A FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS RECOGNIZING THAT TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENT IS. IS -- THE AVERAGE AGE IS TWENTY FIVE MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING AND THIS IS JUST A WHOLE NEW TYPICAL COLLEGE STUDENT THAT WHAT WE THOUGHT OF TWENTY YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO. SO WE WILL BE SUPPORTING HAVE HAD TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE ACCESSIBLE. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT AS WE MEET WITH FOLKS TODAY. IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AROUND EDUCATION AND TRAINING PATHWAYS THAT ARE IN DEMAND AND CREDENTIALS THAT ARE VALUED BY EMPLOYERS. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT. SIMPLE IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AB ONE IS IT. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THERE ARE SO MANY CREDENTIALS THAT THERE'S SOME OF THEM OFFERED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS SOME OF THEM OFFERED BY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS PRIDE AND SOME OF THEM FOR IF THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY. SO. WHAT'S OUT THERE WHICH ONES HAVE VALUE WHERE WHERE WHAT DO EMPLOYERS AND WITHIN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES RECOGNIZED AS VALUABLE SO THAT. PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHERE TO SPEND THEIR TIME AND EFFORT AND MONEY TO GET THIS ADDITIONAL SKILLED TRAINING KNOW WHERE TO GO AND WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THAT IS. WE ALSO -- WILL BE SUPPORTING WE ALSO BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU HEARD -- AS BOB TALK ABOUT I I KNOW YOU BOB. BOB TALK ABOUT APPRENTICESHIP WE THINK -- AND LEARN STRATEGIES OR OR KIND OF REALLY THE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO PREPARE AND TO A MOVE PEOPLE ALONG A WORKFORCE PIPELINE WITH THE BEAUTY. THE BEAUTY OF EARN AND LEARN STRATEGIES IS PEOPLE GETTING PAID WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING IT'S BECAUSE MOST OF THE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR CAN'T LEAVE. LEAVES -- THEIR JOB TO GO AND LEARN. SO WE ARE BIG SUPPORTERS OF APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING AND I I'D LIKE TO MENTION ALSO THAT. THE VALUE OF WE ALSO THINK THE VALUE AND THERE'S A GREAT VALUE AND IN DEVELOPING THESE PRE APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES THEY ARE PATHWAYS. FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR WAY AND THERE'S ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT CAN. CAN REALLY DIVERSIFY THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE MOVING PEOPLE WHO WHO HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY GONE INTO THESE FIELDS. INTO INTO IT A RANGE OF FIELDS. AND FINALLY OUR THIRD THING THAT WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR TODAY IS THE CREATION OF A STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATE FOR YEARS ABOUT CREATING A STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. AND AND OR OR NETWORK. OF SUPPORTERS REALLY BELIEVE THERE'S MULTIPLE VALUE IN IN DOING SO I MEAN YOU KNOW POP IN RESEARCHERS WANTED AND AND A LOT OF OTHER YOU KNOW I THINK POLICY MAKERS WOULD LIKE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE INVESTMENTS THAT THAT -- THAT YOU'RE MAKING IN PROGRAMS THAT AND AND I BOTH WORK FIRST PROGRAMS AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. BUT THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO HAVE ACCESS SO THAT THAT IS STUDENT WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING TO GO O A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WILL REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU KNOW HAVE. YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO WHAT DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO STUDIES -- OF THE OUT THE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES ARE DIFFERENT PUBLIC -- PROGRAMS OF STUDY SO WE REALLY ADVOCATING AS YOU DELIBERATE OVER CREATING THIS LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM THAT YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THE AUDIENCE SUPPORT. AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACCESSIBLE IT'S TRANSPARENT. AND ALSO THAT IT IS BROADER THAN JUST THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY. A OF A DESIGN THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF INTEGRATING WORKFORCE PROGRAMS INTRUDE INTO GRADING -- OTHER INTERVENTIONS WOULD YIELD SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW HOW COME SIMPLY MEANT AND COMPLETION OUTCOMES -- WORK WITH -- WITH. EUROPE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING PRESENT I THANK YOU VERY WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE USE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T STAR YOU GET YOUR PROBABLY START SMALL BUT YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THIS WITH THE CAPABILITY OF INTEGRATING A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND UNDERSTANDING THE INTERRELATIONSHIP. OF THE WIDE RANGE OF HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT ULTIMATELY AFFECT US. AS STUDENTS IN A PART OF CALIFORNIANSOUTCOMES IN OUR SOCIETY. SO IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE WE YOU KNOW WE WE'RE BELIEVERS IN A HIGH QUALITY WORK FIRST -- DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM BUT THAT ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF PROP POVERTY AND GROWING INEQUALITY BUT WE THINK IT HAS A MAJOR MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY. AND WE WE REALLY APPLY TO YOU FOR HAVING US YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS YEAR AND THE YEARS IN THE FUTURE TO WORK WITH YOU. AND MAKE IT A REALITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH WELL I FIRST WANT. TO NOTE THAT SIDE TO THE PUBLIC THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ROADMAP IS ON APPENDIX II THE EDGE COALITION GOALS IS ON APPENDIX K. SKILLS FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGENDA IS ON APPENDIX AL. AND A FOR THE WITNESSES WE WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU CAN SUBMIT OUR PROPOSALS RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLICY ACTIONS ARE TO OUR COMMITTEE AFTER THIS HEARING -- IT'S I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT. OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS I WILL START BY -- POSING A QUESTION TO YOU THAT WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME WITH WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH. OUR EMPLOYERS IN OUR REGION ARE IN STAFF INSTITUTIONS EDUCATION HOW CAN WE HOW CAN THE STATE HELP TO TRANSACT TRANSCEND HISTORIC DIVISIONS THAT EXIST -- IN CAREER TAG COLLEGE DEGREES AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYER NEEDS IF IF YOU CAN OFFER [inaudible] IDEAS [inaudible] WHAT COULD? LET LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT SAYING SO WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS CAREER TECH. WELL I THINK THAT WE HAVE REALLY AND I THINK IS JIM HAS TALKED ABOUT I MEAN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THE POOR THAT THAT WE HAVE TODAY. WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY DESIGNED OUR PROGRAMS. I'D I WOULD YOUR FROM THE EDUCATION PERSPECTIVE AND WE AGO AND WE REALLY NEED TO GET MORE EMPLOYER INPUT. INTO KIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HOWEVER. EMPLOYERS THAT WE DEAL WITH SAY THEY SITTING IT TOO MANY TABLES YOU KNOW EVERY PROGRAM HAS AN EMPLOYER VISOR GROUP. AND AND THAT BECAUSE AND AND SOMETIMES THE WRONG PEOPLE ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE SO IF IT IS A HUGE IT IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. TO TEND TO INTERN TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALIGNED TO WORKFORCE NEEDS -- BUT THERE ARE EFFORTS THERE ARE EFFORTS TO TO BRING TOGETHER AND CONSOLIDATE THIS BUT IT'S IT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE I I WOULD. JIM I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT HAVE. YOUR OUT COMES INCENTIVES AND INTERMEDIARIES. K. -- OUTCOMES MEAN DON'T YOU'VE GOT TO MEASURE SOMETHING THAT ALL OF THEM ARE TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOU LOOK AT THE STRONG WORK FORCE OUTCOMES THEY LINED WITH THE WHEEL OUTCOMES INTENTIONALLY. AND THEY INCLUDED DID THEY GET A JOB TO GET A JOB IN THE FIELD OF STUDY INTO THE GET A RAISE SO SITTING DOWN WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE PRESIDENTS AND THEY SAID WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WE SAID THEN WHO ELSE YOU GET THE MONEY. AND ALL THE SAID THEY HAD A STRONG INTEREST IN IT -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF IN SANTA THAT PROGRAM AND THERE'S OTHERS WERE YOU ACTUALLY CREATED IN THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM 17% OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON RESULTS. AND IT AGAIN IN CONSULTATION WITH THE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS THEY ARE USING EVERY DIME TO IMPROVE THEIR RESULTS BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR 17%. AND INTERMEDIARIES ARE IT IS ASSOCIATIONS THAT -- THAT LIKE IT'S COALITION AND LIKE THE WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION BUT ALSO THE REGIONAL CIVIC LEADERS EVERYONE OF OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS IS ENGAGED IN WORKFORCE. AND AS MISTER NEAL CAN TELL YOU THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE BRINGING TOGETHER THE SYSTEMS. AND USING THEIR OWN POLITICAL CAPITAL AT A SCALE WHERE THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHICH IS COMMUNITY AND REGION IN ORDER SAY LOOK WE'VE GOT THE NEED WE'VE GOT THE DOLLARS WE'VE GOT THE INCENTIVES WERE DRIVING TOWARDS THE OUTCOMES WHAT DOES IT TAKE. YOU CAN'T ENGINEER IT FROM HERE BUT YOU CAN CREATE THE STRUCTURE AND WHICH STORE LEADERS AT A REGIONAL COMMUNITY SCALE CAN WORK WITH THESE ASSOCIATIONS TO MOVE THE NEEDLE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE DELIBERATE ABOUT IT. AND I WOULD JUST ADD ONE MORE THING TO THAT -- I SPENT THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS -- LAST WEEK WITH THE KRYCEK EDUCATION CONSORTIUM THE STATE'S AND WITH MANY SUPERINTENDENTS A HIGH SCHOOL'S FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE GET OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WORKPLACE READY? AND THE MORE I START THINKING ABOUT THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT THE A THREE G. REQUIREMENTS AND HOW. HOW HIGH WE HOLD THEM UP -- WHEN WHEN MY STUDENTS REGISTER FOR CLASSES EVERY YEAR THEY STOP BY THEIR COUNSELORS DESK AND THEY GET HANDED THE A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS THEY DON'T GET HANDED ANYTHING ABOUT C. T. E. PROGRAMS? PROGRAMS OF STUDY-- AND THE FUTURE THAT WORK AND BRING TO THEM SO WE NEED TO INGRAIN WORK IN HIGH SCHOOLS. LASTLY I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE THE COUNSELORS AND HIGH SCHOOLS CALIFORNIA. IS THE NATION'S LAST RATIO TO COLLEGE CAREER COUNSELORS TO STUDENTS NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN STUDENTS TO EVERY CAREER COUNSELOR. AND AND THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP AND SO IF THERE IS A WAY THAT THESE INTERMEDIARIES THESE WORKFORCE BOARDS CAN GET INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND PROVIDE CAREER COUNSELING. LIKE THEY DO IN OTHER STATES AND SOUTH CAROLINA -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE FABULOUS SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD A THOUGHT ABOUT -- FUNDING AND AND I I THINK THAT LOOKING AT OUTCOMES IS HUGE AND LATE BUT IT'S COMPLICATED AND IF WE REALLY WANT TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS YOU YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK AT THOSE OUTCOMES SO THAT YOUR AND YOU SO YOU'RE NOT DOING THE WRONG THING. BECAUSE IT FUNDING IS TO TIED TO TWO QUARTERS CERTAIN OUTCOMES THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT REACHING THE PEOPLE WE NEED TO REACH TO BREAK THE CYCLES OF POVERTY WE HAVE IN THE STATE. SO IT'S I I AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUTCOMES WE HAVE TO HEAD THAT'S WHY WE DO NEED A DATA SYSTEM WE HAVE BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE WE'RE TRUMP WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS VERY COMPLICATED. VERY COMPARABLE. TO THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M AN OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST A REAL QUICK -- COUPLE QUESTIONS ON FRIENDS PROGRAMS AND TECHNICAL TRADES AND AND HEARING THE GOVERNOR TALK ABOUT UPSCALING WORKERS AND RATHER THAN TRYING TO DISPLACE THEM AT CERTAIN POINTS BUT AN EARLY ON THROUGH -- HIGH SCHOOL -- MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THAT ACCESSIBILITY -- FOR TRADES APPRENTICE PROGRAMS TO BE PART OF THE DIALOGUE OR TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF FUTURE OF GOING ON TO ATTAIN YOUR COLLEGE DEGREES THAT'S GREAT. BUT THERE'S ALSO THOSE THE PERCENTAGES DE NOT EVERYONE'S GOING TO MAKE IT TO THAT POINT AT THAT TIME IN THEIR LIFE RIGHT SO LET'S GIVE HIM OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE EARLY. EARLY ON IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN WE'RE OUT THERE HAVING THESE DIFFERENT FAIRS THAT ARE THERE THAT APPRENTICE PROGRAMS TRADE PROGRAMS M. ARE WELCOMED ON CAMPUS IS TO SHOW THAT THAT IS A VIABLE TRADE. TO GET ENGAGED AND WE WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THAT AND WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU TO THE CHAIR ON GATHER MORE DATA AND TO LEND OUR SUPPORT TO THAT. ALSO WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT -- THE EDUCATION AND MOVING FORWARD ON SOME OF THOSE THINGS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN COLLEGE -- AND AFFORDABILITY THIS THERE IS LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE OF PART TIME STUDENTS THERE ARE ALSO THERE. PART TIME STUDENTS THAT NOW MAY BE ON IN THEIR LIFE FIGURE THEY NEED TO GET YOU KNOW INTO EDUCATION SEE THOSE THINGS BUT NOW THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR A FAMILY THEY'RE WORKING THEY'RE DOING THOSE THINGS. SO LET'S NOT FORGET WHEN WE START TO MOVE FORWARD TO BRING THE TOPIC AROUND HIGHER EDUCATION LET'S NOT FORGET THE PART TIME STUDENTS THAT ARE THERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD THEIR LIVES ALSO. IN THE BIGGER IT MAKES ITS THERE THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE POINTS THAT I WANTED TO TO RAISE MINIATURE. YEAH I HAVE SEVERAL FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS A HOW DO WE BEST PREPARE OUR WORK FORCE -- FOR THINGS LIKE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH A JIM MENTIONED EARLIER ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION AS A HOLD. CAN WE INCORPORATE THOSE -- THINGS INTO YOUR APPRENTICESHIPS -- PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS SOME OF THE CHANNELS THAT WE CAN DO THAT WITH. SO -- EXCELLENT QUESTION -- SO WOMEN CHILD SO. THAT THE THE FOURTEEN WORKFORCE REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN -- ORGANIZED THE FORTY FIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S IN TO FOURTEEN REGIONS -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE WORKING REGIONALLY AS WELL ADULT SCHOOLS -- TO ARE BEGINNING TO PULL INDUSTRY SECTORS TOGETHER AND I THINK THE KEY IS YOU NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST ONE EMPLOYER BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A GROUP OF INDUSTRIES -- WHETHER ITS MANUFACTURING THE OR EVEN RETAIL GROCERY TO TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT THEY ARE SEEING COMING DOWN THE PIPE -- JIM SAID IT EARLIER BUSINESSES OF THE FIRST ONES TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECTS OF AUTOMATION THE EFFECTS OF A AYE. AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO DICTATE THE CURRICULUM THAT'S TAUGHT TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ARE ADULTS ON WHAT THEY NEED TO GET INTO THOSE JOBS. SO WE HAVE TO ENGAGE BUSINESS AT A AT A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL AND IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN AROUND SOME OF THE SECTOR INITIATIVES AND ONE THING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN DO. IS TO ADOPT A SECTOR STRATEGY APPROACH -- AS A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR DOING WORKFORCE IN EDUCATION AND REGION'S DROUGHT STATE. I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD I THINK THAT EURO AS WE AS THESE INDUSTRIES CHANGE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DO JOBS BUT THEY'LL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE OUT OF JOBS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A STRATEGY OF HOW TO BRING. A WORKFORCE TRAINING TO THE EMPLOYER. EMPLOYMENT SO THAT WE CAN UP SKILL AND AND AND TRANSITION AS MANY BETWEEN NOT EVERYONE WILL BE. CAPABLE OF THAT TRANSITION YEAH WE HAVE I THINK MENTIONED EARLIER WAS EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL PROGRAM. THAT HAS RESOURCES FOR THAT BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY THEY WE GET THIS YEAR I THINK OR THIS YEAR THERE'S ABOUT NINETY MILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES TO RETRAINING -- AND ITS PERFORMANCE BASED AND IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM BUT REALLY AS WE'RE THINKING OF THE SCOPE OF THIS OVER THE YEARS HAT YOUR TO RETHINK OUR INVESTMENTS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH WE TRY TO LEVERAGE. NOT JUST GOVERNMENTAL MONEY BUT LEVERAGE IMPORTANT ASSONANCE IN IN TANDEM TO RETRAIN THEIR CURRENT WORK FORCE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE A DO ALLEGE PROBLEM. LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID A TWENTY SIX MEETINGS SELECT CREATE AN ONLINE COLLEGE WITH EMPLOYERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. THAN NOT MOST COMMON REFRAIN WAS THEY SAW THIS IS VERY VALUABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO WHAT BOB AND RUN IT JUST SAID. THAT HAVE SOLD SOME OF THIS IS WHAT CAN WE TEACH THAT THAT IS ABOUT ENTREPRENEURIAL AND BILLY TO LEARN AND ABILITY TO ADAPT. SOME OF THAT IS CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PARTNERSHIP SO WE CAN REACT QUICKLY. YEAH IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE MORE THING -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT RUN A SAID. HISTORICALLY A LOT OF THAT AND WE CALLED INCUMBENT WORKER TRAINING A LOT OF THAT INCOME BUT WORKER TRAINING IS LOOKED ON AS CORPORATE WELFARE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE YOU KNOW. SUPPORT BUSINESSES UPGRADING THEIR OWN TALENT -- AND PEOPLE FEEL THAT THE BUSINESSES SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THAT HOWEVER I THINK WE SEE THAT IF IF THAT IF IT'S NOT A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS WERE LEFT WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A HUGE SEGMENT. OF OUR POPULATION IS BEING LEFT BEHIND. CAN I ADD TO THAT I'D SAY THAT ALSO HEALTHCARE IS ONE OF THE HUGEST INDUSTRIES WHERE WE HAVE WORKFORCE THESE ESPECIALLY WELL PAYING MIDDLE SKILL WORKFORCE THESE AND MOST OF HEALTHCARE. DOESN'T PAY INTO THE APPOINTMENT TRAINING FUND AND IS CAN IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RESOURCES TO UPGRADE THEIR THEIR WORKFORCE. AND TO TRAIN THEIR WORKFORCE ABOUT THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS A WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE MOST OF THE JOB GROVE -- IN CALIFORNIA IS IS WERE -- A LET'S SAY A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SAID NEEDED OR TO YOUR COLLEGE A COLLEGE HERE ADVANCE SOMEBODY WITH THAT ADVANCED DEGREE WHICH WHICH WOULD. BILL WOULD BE CORRECT TO SAY THAT -- WHICH LEVEL WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE MOST OF THE JOB GROWTH IS SO YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THIS THE WORKER SUPPLY SIDE AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM AS OPPOSED TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE DEMAND SIDE OF THAT AND AND WHAT. I CAN SUGGEST TO YOU IS THAT IN EVERYONE OF OUR REGIONS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BOTH AND AND I WOULD ADD JUST. FOR MY OWN PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE IS I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL OF WHAT I SEE IS A REAL DEMAND. FOR BOTH THE CREDENTIAL PEACE YOUR THE TWO YEAR OR THE CERTIFICATE. AND THE MORE ADVANCED THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE YOU KNOW AS A MOTHER I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN AS HAVING DIMINISHING VALUE YOU'RE EITHER GOING TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S VERY TARGETED AND THEN DEMAND WITH IT YOU KNOW BUT AND RECOGNIZED BY EMPLOYERS VALUABLE OR YOU'RE GOING ON FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS. AND AND MANY OF THE CAREER CENTER'S THEIR BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT TEAMS ARE NOW TRYING. TO TO RECOMMEND THE BUSINESSES THAT VARIANCE IN LIEU OF AFTER YOU KNOW FOR YOUR DEGREE IS REQUIRED BUT WILL TAKE EXPERIENCE IN LIEU OF THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE -- AS A WAY TO GIVE EMPLOYERS MORE OPTIONS FOR FOLKS THAT MAY HAVE A TWO YEAR DEGREE. AND THE EXPERIENCE WHO COULD BE JUST AS VALUABLE OF NOT MORE THAN SOMEBODY COMING RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE AT THE FOR YOU THANK YOU. SO I DO WANT TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE WORK FORCE -- IN CALIFORNIA WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE. THAT OUR OUR GREATEST STRENGTH IS WHEN IT COMES TO WORK FORCE. OUR DIVERSITY WE HAVE AYE BE SOMETIMES SOME PEOPLE SEE IS THAT CHALLENGE I WE SEE IT IS A TREMENDOUS STRENGTH FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CAPITALIZE ON IT BUILD ON IT. AND YOU KNOW AND AN INTEGRATED INTO OUR FUTURE IN IN REAL POSITIVE WAYS YES. DIVERSITY AND IS YOUR CIVIC EXAMPLE OF HOW JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE WORK SOME WORK THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AROUND MAKE THE NEXUS BETWEEN VERY SMALL BUSINESS ESPECIALLY ETHNIC CAM AND IMMIGRANT BUSINESSES AND GLOBAL TRADE. BECAUSE THE INTERNET ALLOWS ALL OF THEM TO TO TO ENGAGE IN THAT ENTIRE MARKET SO -- IT'S THIS LONG BEEN OUR STRENGTH. AND WE'RE FINDING NEW WAYS FOR TO BE A STRENGTH EVEN IN A CHANGING AND GLOBALLY MARKETED WORLD. YEAH I WOULD ECHO THAT. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'D I CERTAINLY WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE ASKING YOU QUESTIONS I PERSONALLY I KNOW THAT I WILL BE REACHING OUT. TO EACH OF YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I THINK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. MEMBERS THE NEXT PANEL THERE'S NO FORMAL PRESENTATION THIS IS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO JUST DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER AND TO MAYBE DISCUSS POINTS ON HOW TO BUILD A COMPETITIVE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY -- EACH OF OUR NEXT SPEAKERS REPRESENTS GROUP GROUP INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESS THE PROFESSIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPER AND A MANUFACTURER OR GOALS TO ASK -- EACH WITNESS SHORE AND FOCUS QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY TOP TRENDS. A POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS TOWARDS SUPPORTING ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IF WE CAN HAVE OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS JOIN US. WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME SCOTT. HOWARD SHOULD PRESIDENT OF CAL INSURANCE IN ASSOCIATES INC. PAUL GRAY NEO PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA OF THE INLAND EMPIRE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP. AND NICOLE RICE POLICY DIRECTOR WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS UNITS OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING'S AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION HOW WELCOME EACH. OF OUR PANELISTS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. AT THIS MOMENT I LIKE TO OFER EACH OF YOU AN OPPORTUNITY. TO WRITE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND WE COULD TURN IT OVER FOUR SEVEN Q. AND A GREAT GUY. AT YOUR CERVANTES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF PETER VIEGAS THE CHAIR OF THE INLAND EMPIRE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AND OUR OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFY -- I KIND OF WANT TO BE THE COLOR COME OF A REGIONAL -- FOCUS ON SOME OF THE THE FAX AND THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE HEARD THIS MORNING. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY -- A REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS A CON IS AN ECONOMY OF REGIONS AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN CREATE POLICY -- THAT REFLECTS THAT I THINK THE BETTER WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT. THE STATE THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC -- MILIEU. MY MEMBERS ARE THE LARGER EMPLOYERS OF THE INLAND EMPIRE -- THE INLAND EMPIRE IS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES -- SABATINO COUNTY THE SIZE OF ISRAEL -- RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE SIZE OF NEW JERSEY -- FOUR POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE U. S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS ON OUR WAY TO SIX POINT. FIVE BY -- TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY FORTY BUT A REGION'S OF OVER MILLION WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE LOWEST BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT IN THE COUNTRY. AND SO THAT IS A LIMITING FACTOR -- ON THE TYPE OF INDUSTRY THAT WE CAN WE CAN HALF -- WE ARE -- THEREFORE VERY -- BLUE COLLAR DEPENDENT REGION -- MANUFACTURING -- GOODS MOVEMENT AND LOGISTICS THE BLUE COLLAR JOBS AND HEALTH CARE. ARE REALLY -- THE FOCUS OF OUR ORGANIZATION. AND WE DO PUBLIC POLICY IN WASHINGTON AND HERE FOR OUR MEMBERS -- BUT WE'RE ALSO HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE OF EDUCATION AND WORK FORCE -- BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO MY MEMBERS AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN -- GET THIS RIGHT I THINK -- THE BETTER WE WILL BE -- GROWTH AS OUR REGION -- I TALKED ABOUT THE THE THE PRESSURE OF A LOW BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT -- OF REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS THE FOURTH LARGEST LATINO POPULATION LOS ANGELES NEW YORK HOUSTON AND THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND YET DISPROPORTIONATELY LATINOS ARE AFFECTED BY THAT -- BACCALAUREATE ATTAINMENT ISSUE AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EQUITY ISSUES -- DISPROPORTIONATELY NOT A LOT OF FOCUS BEING PUT ON THAT HALF OF OUR POPULATION TWO POINT TWO MILLION. AND ALL OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE IMPORTANT -- BUT I REALLY DO THINK THAT AS CALIFORNIA'S LATINO POPULATION GROWS WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE FINDING WAYS THAT -- WE CAN -- CHANGE -- THE RESULTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY GETTING AN EDUCATION WORKFORCE AND AND MY BUSINESS MEMBERS WILL TELL YOU WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR LEADERSHIP BENCH -- THEY KNOW THAT THE THAT -- MINORITIES ARE. COUPLE OF THINGS TWO THINGS FROM THE SECOND TO PRESENTATION THAT YOU SAW -- CALLED OUT -- THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRIES -- THE GOODS MOVE IN INDUSTRY AS GREATER LOS ANGELES -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES YOU KNOW. HOW? THE SUPPLY CHAIN AFFECTS THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND SO AS AS MISTER MAYOR IS TALKING ABOUT THE FOCUS ON REGIONS -- JUST IN THAT PRESENTATION AND NO DISRESPECT OKAY -- BUT WE HAVE TO DIG DEEPER INTO GREATER LOS ANGELES IS TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE DEPENDING HOW YOU YOU -- LAID OUT -- HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S -- POPULATION LIVE SOUTH OF THE TWO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE POLICY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OF THESE ISSUES WE HAVE TO GET TO I THINK A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL -- BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS. ON THE ISSUE OF EMPLOYER MEANING GAUGE MEANT EVERYTHING THAT THE LAST PANEL SAID. EMPLOYERS BEING ASKED TO ATTEND TOO MANY MEETINGS NOT GETTING THE OUTCOMES THAT THEY WANT -- THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER MODELS OF HOW WE REGIONAL LIVES -- AT THAT THE THAT THE SUBREGION LEVEL -- BUT ALSO MAYBE BREAKING THE STATE OFTEN TO YOU KNOW ELEVEN DIFFERENT REGIONS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THESE. THESE CONVERSATIONS. LAST A PIECE AT ALL BRING UP IS -- OF ALL THOSE PRESSURES ON THE INLAND EMPIRE THE ONE THAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS THE RISE OF THE ROBOTS. AND IT IS AUTOMATION. SO -- ACCORDING TO WORK DONE OUT OF UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS -- AUTOMATED AWAY BY -- TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE ANOTHER SURVEY THAT SAID -- 47% OF OUR JOBS DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO CREATE NEW JOBS WE ARE GOING TO CREATE NEW JOBS. BUT WE NEED TO BE HYPER. VIGILANT -- WEEK WE CANNOT WAIT -- THE EXAMPLE I USE YESTERDAY TO TALK IS WHEN'S THE LAST TIME ANY OF US WALKED INTO THE BANK TO GET MONEY RIGHT. FOR GENERATION NOW WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE ATM THAT WAS THE CUTTING EDGE OF AUTOMATION. AND WE SEE IT LITTLE BY LITTLE -- AND IT'S MEANT TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER OKAY IT'S MEANT TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER. BUT IT DOES HAVE -- CONSEQUENCES FOR EMPLOYMENT -- THIS IS GREAT STATE AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL STATE AND WE HAVE SO MANY ADVANTAGES BUT WE NEED TO WORK MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER -- ON THESE BIG ISSUES THANK YOU MISTER WE CAN MOVE -- TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER TO PROVIDE A BRIEF PHONE COMMENTS AS WELL OPENING INTRODUCTION A CHORUS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- BY INTRODUCTION THIS NICOLE RICE WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE STATE WIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS. OF CALIFORNIA'S THIRTY THOUSAND PLUS A MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AND ARE ONE POINT THREE MILLION -- MANUFACTURING WORKERS -- ALSO JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU -- MY BACKGROUND IN THIS ISSUE AREA WE CURRENTLY CO CHAIR -- A COALITION -- ALONG WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES THAT FOCUSES ON K. THROUGH -- TWELVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CTV POLICIES CALLED THE GET REAL A COALITION REELS AN ACRONYM THAT SPENT STANDS FOR RELEVANCE IN EDUCATION AND LEARNING -- ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE AGILE COALITION THAT WAS -- PRESENTED AND REPRESENTED -- BY ROSE SHERIFF ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL -- ALSO HAVE BEEN A MEMBER FORCE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WORKING WITH -- FAN OF VICE CHANCELLOR BONTA ON QUINLIVAN TO ESTABLISH THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO SHORE UP THERE CRITIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND OFFERINGS. AND FINALLY -- A PROUD MEMBER OF THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD -- WORKING WITH SOME VERY OUTSTANDING PEOPLE AS AN APPOINTEE OF GOVERNOR BROWN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM I LOOK FOR TO YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THINK HERE. WELCOME. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY -- I AM THE PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER. OF SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO. AGENCY FOR ABOUT FORTY FORTY YEARS OR SO SO I HAVE. ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WHAT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR ALL MY LIFE -- JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND SPOKE WITH ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ALWAYS GET ASKED IS WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS. AND IT DOES VERY DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE ASKING. THE SB A USES ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. CALIFORNIA USES ABOUT A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND THEN YOU'LL UP TALK TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MICRO BUSINESSES AND THAT'S LESS THAN TEN EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MOST PART -- WE LOOK AT WITH. LESS THAN A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WHO RECOGNIZE WITHIN EMPLOYEES THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEN FORTY FOUR AT A HUNDRED EMPLOYEE -- FOR THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY LOOTING SOUL WRITERS. PROXIMALLY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION -- SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA -- SO. AND WE MAKE UP ABOUT 50% OF THE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 50% OF THE EMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA WORKS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND AND WHAT I'M TALKING HERE I'M TALKING HUNDRED EMPLOYEES -- AS A DEFINITION. AS AN ORGANIZATION WE FOCUS ON WHAT I CALL THE GLOBAL ISSUES THAT AFFECT ALL SMOKERS. WE DO AN ANNUAL SURVEY RETIREMENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT -- ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO SMALL BUSINESS AND SOME OF WHICH WE CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON SO WE WHICH WE CAN'T. BUT EVERY YEAR THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE HAS BEEN AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH INSURANCE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT'S BEEN THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE DOES HIS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING THOUGH IS WE LOOKED. AT A WE GIVE A A LIST OF ISSUES AND WHAT I THOUGHT REALLY INTERESTING AS FAR AS SMALL BUSINESSES STORES ISSUES. IS -- THE OTHER HOUSING COSTS WITH. A HUGE HUGE ECONOMY THOSE KIND OF THINGS. BUT HIGH UP ON THE LIST. QUALITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS YOU DON'T THINK OF THAT THAT IS A MAJOR ISSUE FOR FOR SMALL BUSINESSES -- AND THAT'S OUR WORKFORCE SO. THAT IS CRITICAL. THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP IS IMAGES MOVE THE MICROPHONE A LITTLE CLOSER TO SAID THAT I WAS I HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING MONNING CARE. THE OTHER ISSUE IS INFRASTRUCTURE -- IS VERY VERY HIGH ON THE IMPORTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESS GETTING YOUR GOODS TO AND FROM -- TO AND FROM YOUR CUSTOMERS -- VERY HIGH THE ONES YOU'D NORMALLY THINK OF IS -- REGULATIONS TAXATION THOSE CAN MAKE REGULATIONS COMES UP WITH A VERY -- VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IMPACTS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AS AN ORGANIZATION. WE TRY TO FOCUS -- ON THOSE ISSUES OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS SIX SIGNIFICANT ISSUE -- START UP CAPITAL VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE SO WE WE GET HEAVILY INVOLVED IN HIM BACK -- WE'VE THIS YEAR OR FOCUSING -- ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES BUT REALLY QUICK. FOCUSING ON ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF BILLS -- FOR FORTY SEVEN WHICH WILL -- BASICALLY PUT MONEY IN THE GOVERNOR GO GO BIZ PROGRAM -- WHICH WE THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH WILL PROVIDE CAPITALS SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEN WE ARE ALSO VERY INVOLVED IN -- CROWD FUNDING. WHICH IS A NEW SOURCE FOR SMALL MIRACLES ON NEW BUT WE WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESS WE HAVE A BILL -- SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE WHICH IS -- ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUILDING THE WERE THEY WERE FOCUSING ON ONE OF THE THINGS JUST TO JUST. TO GENERAL COMMENTS. IS IS A HERE. AND THIS IS WHAT I HEAR FROM SMALL BUSINESSES AND IT TO A LARGE DEGREE MAY BE OUR FAULT WERE WORKING. MOST OF US AND IT'S TO GET INVOLVED IN ISSUES THE TAKE AWAY FROM OUR FOR MORE JOBS BUT BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BEEN PUT. AND HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- IS IS REALLYIMPORTANT AS AS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER -- PUTTING TOGETHER OUTREACH TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO SMALL BUSINESS HAVE SEATED ABLE. AND BE ABLE TO GIVE GIVE THEIR INPUT BECAUSE THEY COME IN A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FAN. MAJOR EMPLOYERS -- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THOSE KIND OF THINGS -- AND AND THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE FOR SMOKERS. THANK YOU AND AND YOU KNOW I FIND I JUST YOU SPOKE ABOUT REGULATION AND SO. IN YOUR POINT OF VIEW WHAT STEPS CAN THE STATE TAKE TO MAKE REGULATION SMARTER FOR THE REAL REALITIES THAT SMALL BUSINESSES FACE AND I KNOW THAT WE PROBABLY ALL HAD DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES BACK IN OUR HOME DISTRICTS BUT WANTED TO POSE THAT QUESTION AND AND SEE. IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SOLUTIONS COMMENTS ON THAT. WELL THE PROBLEM. THAT SMALL BUSINESS SPACES THERE'S A WHOLE LOTTA REGULATIONS A WHOLE WATER PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. AND IN A LOT OF CASES. REGULATIONS ARE INTEGRATED -- WHAT THE STATE HAS WITH WHAT LOCAL -- WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS IN THE REGULATIONS THEY PLACE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND? A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHERE THE REGULATIONS ARE COMING FROM THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT'S COMING FROM THE STATE OR WHETHER IT'S COMING. LOCALLY. THEY JUST KNOW REGULATIONS ARE PROBLEM AND AND PERMITTING IS A PROBLEM AND IN SOME CASES THERE IS NOT DISCUSSION -- BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ENTITIES. SO THE REGULATIONS ON A LOCAL BASIS ON INTEGRATED WITH WHAT'S ON A STATE BASIS. AND THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER SO THAT IS -- THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THE OTHER THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. BE HELPFUL AND I KNOW -- THIS IS BEING DONE TO SOME DEGREE -- IN IN VARIOUS ENTITIES BUT LOOKING AT THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE OUT OUT THERE IN STREAMLINING THEM GETTING RID OF THE ONES THAT ARE -- NOT APPLE ICAL DUPLICATIONS THOSE KIND OF THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO -- MANY MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT 64% OF MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ACTUALLY. LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES SO THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES. IN OUR INDUSTRY AND THEY MAKE UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND RELY ON OUR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED OR LARGER MANUFACTURERS -- FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD -- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS SCOTT WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT -- ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT REGULATIONS COMING FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENT SOURCES AND SMALL COMPANIES HAVING CHALLENGES. TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THAT LET ALONE ABOUT COMPLIANCE THEY DON'T HAVE BIG H. R. DEPARTMENT OR MAYBE EVEN AN HR PERSON IT MIGHT JUST BE THE OWNER THEMSELVES TRYING. TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY TO THE STATE AND EVEN THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS DEFINITELY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S COMPLY THAT NOT COMPLIANCE I'M SORRY BUT THERE IS COORDINATION. BETWEEN THOSE REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE NOT CONFLICTING OR CREATING SOME CHALLENGES -- WITH COMPLIANCE FOR THOSE -- THOSE PRIORITIES AND POLICY INITIATIVES BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT BECAUSE THE SMALL MANUFACTURERS ARE SMALL COMPANIES DON'T HAVE THESE H. R. PROFESSIONALS ARE DEPARTMENT. THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO CURE VERY MINOR REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT BE PAPER VIOLATIONS OR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THREATENING THE HATE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WAR OR THE WORK FORCE OR OR THEIR THEIR CONSUMERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. YOUR WHERE IT IS REASON DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE HELPFUL IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THE STATE HAS -- ENACTED A REVIEW OF REGULATION TO DETERMINE -- ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT REVIEWED SO THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT ECONOMIC AND NON ECONOMIC IMPACTS BECAUSE FOR THE SMALLER GUYS. THE WHAT THE REGULATIONS WHAT THE PURPOSE IS AND THEIR THEIR OUTCOME AND THEIR IMPACT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE ARE THE COMPANIES WHO ARE RIGHT THERE ON THE ON THE TAP. OF EITHER PROSPERITY OR HAVING TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS SO MAKING SURE THAT THE REGULATIONS TARGET IT IT MAKES SENSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN OVER REACHING OVER OVER BURDENSOME IMPACT. TO REALLY YOU KNOW TO THREATEN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE SMALL COMPANIES IS IMPORTANT TO BY LOOKING AT THE REGULATION IMPACTS TO THE ECONOMY. BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM. THANK YOU MISTRESS. SO YOU KNOW WE STRIVE TO BE A TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE ORGANIZATION -- THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY AND AN EQUITY. I THINK -- TO PUT YOU KNOW. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. THE CALIFORNIA -- IS A REGULATORY BOARD. EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE EFFECTS BECAUSE OF YOU AFFECT THE ECONOMY -- THE EIGHT NATURAL COMES YOU'RE GONNA FACT EQUITY AND SO. AN EXAMPLE THERE I THINK OF HOW THEN DO WE LOOK AT THE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH REGULATION HOW DO WE TAKE THOSE INTO CONSIDERATION AND I THINK THE MORE -- OVERSIGHT THE MORE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED ABOUT WELL WHAT IS THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO DO DOWN THE ROAD -- I THINK SOMETIMES THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S MISSION WHEN YOU DEAL WITH SINGLE FOCUSED AGENCIES. THANK YOU MICHIGAN AREA. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BOB DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND CALIFORNIA ARE SELF EMPLOYED -- IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OR OTHERWISE [inaudible] WELL I'VE. FIRST OF ALL TO FIND SELF EMPLOYEE EMPLOYED -- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. THE THEIR SELF EMPLOYED WITH NO EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT'S DEFINED RIGHT YEAH YEAH. YOU CAN BE A SELF EMPLOYED IS CORRECT SOLE PROPRIETOR I USE. FOR CORRECT RIDER WITH EMPLOYEES PRESS. FOR FOR THE MOST PART -- THE NUMBERS ARE. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY THE NUMBER BUT THE VAST MAJORITY. OF BUSINESSES ARE LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES -- PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. OF THE OF THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION SO TO THE LARGE MAJORITY ARE. TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. COMPANIES ARE LESS AND FIVE EMPLOYEES. THANKS. MISTER ROBERTS DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION JUST REAL. QUICK MADAM CHAIR I JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WITH YOURSELF AND AND MISTER BENNY OF THAT WE'VE. START LOOKING AT WITH -- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING ON THERE WITH THEM GENERATION GOLF TEAMING UP WITH -- THE BUSINESSES IN THE AREA IN THAT PARTICULAR -- PROGRAM PILOT PROGRAM I WORKED WITH THEM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM SAN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL ARE SEVERAL CITY UNIFIED. AND EARLY HEAD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AND MEDICAL TRANSPORT INITIAL BRINGING -- STUDENTS TOGETHER NOT WAITING UNTIL FURTHER ROM BUT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL -- IN BRINGING THEM FORWARD TO EXPOSE THEM TO THE PIPELINE OF OF THE WORK FORCE ITSELF. AND THE AT THAT PILOT PROGRAM WE HAD THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY STUDENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THAT. AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEY ALSO WENT TO THE COMMUNICABLE AJ AND AND BUILT THE CREDITS UP THERE. AND UPON GRADUATION THE SEVERAL OF THEM WERE OFFERED A FULL TIME POSITION WITHIN THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE THERE SO THESE TYPES OF THINGS ARE GOING ON THE MANUFACTURING ASPECT WITHIN THE INLAND EMPIRE. IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO A LARGE SECTOR OF OF GROWTH IT'S IN OUR AREA AND LOOKING AT THOSE AREAS THAT ARE THERE AND BILLION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE MAKING SURE THAT THE ROADS IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. ARE ALL THEIR SO THAT THIS PRESENTATION IN THIS THIS HEARING -- OUT OF CHAIRS BEEN REALLY GREAT AND WELL ROUNDED AS FAR AS TOUCHING ALL THE DIFFERENT TOPICS. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS FAR AS FOR BUT SEEN THE SUCCESS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE INLAND EMPIRE I THINK WE NEED TO SHOW THAT STORY. A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WHEN WE DO TALK ABOUT. AREAS IN GREATER LOS ANGELES AND THOSE ARE ALL GREAT BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THERE'S REGION'S RIGHT REGIONAL GOALS AND NEED TO BE DONE. WE COULD SET UP A STRUCTURE THAT COULD FIT EACH REGION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE GOALS THAT ARE THERE JUST WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION FOR YOUR DISCUSSION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON YOU KNOW I'M I'M THE FATHER OF THE SEVEN YEAR OLD. AND THIS ISSUE OF SKILLS DEVELOPMENT I KNOW WHAT SHE CAN DO AND LEARN ON THE IPAD -- HER MOTHER HAS A PHD -- I'VE GOT TO ADVANCED DEGREES IN THEOLOGY OKAY -- IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE AGAINST HIGHER ED -- BUT I HAVE TO TRY AND BE THE BEST DAD I CAN'T AND MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE -- SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE AND SO THIS ISSUE OF HOW WE BILLET% SKILLS -- EXPERIENCE BE A ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE TEAM WORK ALL OF THAT HAS TO START VERY YOUNG SO -- AND I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE ABOUT THE FOCUS ON REGION'S APPROACH. AND I DO WANT TO ADD ONS THAT THERE THERE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL REGIONAL INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE READ A BALLOTS AND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE BUILD ON THAT AND I LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT OTHER REGIONS ARE DOING THAT ARE WORKING. I JUST TALKING ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE IN TALKING ABOUT THE I. E. OPPORTUNITIES ARE. MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS AS I ALWAYS SHARE WITH FOLKS THEY HAVE TO THE COMMUTE INTO OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES FOR WORK -- FOR HIGH SKILLED WHAT WE'RE LOSING IS THIS BRAIN DRAIN -- THAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT WE HAVE GREAT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SURROUNDING THE INLAND EMPIRE FROM SAMBAR DINO COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND MANY OF THESE RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES ARE LEAVING FOR BETTER JOBS IN OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES NOW. WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS MISTER GREMIO YOU KNOW HOW WHAT DO YOU SEE. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TRADE TRACKS -- THESE HIGH SKILLED EMPLOYERS TO OUR REGION. YOU WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO PROPOSE -- IN ORDER TO GET THESE HIGH SKILLED JOBS IN THE AREAS -- SUCH AS SAMBAR DO NO COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR AFTER THE RISE OF THE ROBOTS THIS IS THE SECOND. ONE THE KEEPS ME UP AND IT'S THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG SO. MY WIFE WORKS AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL -- YOU KNOW FOR OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE GRADUATING AND WANT TO WORKING TACK IN THERE'S NO TECH INDUSTRY. SO THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE AND ARE GOING TO GO TO THE SILICON VALLEY THEY'RE GOING TO GO -- TO THE COAST BOSTON AND THEY'LL GO I THINK. AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THIS HOUSING ISSUE AND AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THAT'S ALSO -- A CHOICE THAT THEY'RE MAKING -- YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MOST MONEY EARLY ON IN THEIR CAREERS HOW AFFORDABLE IS CALIFORNIA -- YOU NO MATTER CHAIR YOU KNOW THAT -- A HOUSE IN NORCO IT'S THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE -- THE SAME HOUSE. GAINES ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BY JUST BEING AND AND AN ORANGE COUNTY YOU DIDN'T EVEN PAINTED IT'S THE SAME HOUSE RIGHT -- THAT THAT THAT HAS A LIMITING FACTOR SO I THINK IT IS THE EDUCATION WE'RE PRODUCING VERY WELL EDUCATED -- INDIVIDUALS -- BUT WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE BUSINESS TO SAY OKAY WELL THERE ARE REGIONS WHERE IT'S CHEAPER TO DO BUSINESS -- BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE WORK FORCE THAT THEY NEED -- BUT IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH BECAUSE SOME OF THESE. OTHER ISSUES OF OF OF ALSO AFFECTING -- THAT THAT THAT GROUP THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS PRESENT IT WAS ABOUT RESTORING AND MANUFACTURING AND HOW TO REMOVE THESE BARRIERS AND SO -- AS THE FORMER SPEAKER JUST SAID YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PAIN POINTS -- TO IT TRACK TEAM BUSINESS INVESTMENT INTO CALIFORNIA THAT'S PROBABLY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION. AND PROBABLY CAN TAKE ITS OWN HEARING -- BUT GIVEN THE FACT AS OR AS AN INDUSTRY ARE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OUT OF STATE COMPETITION IT'S HARD TO JUST CHOOSE ONE OR TWO PARTICULAR AREAS -- THAT COULD BE LIKE A SILVER BULLET TO REMOVING THESE BARRIERS IT'S THE WHOLE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF OF THE END OF THE IMPACT THAT WE FEEL AS AS COMPANIES -- THAT MAKE IT CHALLENGING. FOR WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ATTRACT SOME ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT I ALSO THINK IT'S NOTEWORTHY TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE WE'RE SEEING RE SHORING AND WE'RE SEEING MORE MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT I THINK IT'S UPWARDS OF 12% NATIONWIDE. CALIFORNIA'S HALF OF THAT SO IT IS A TIMELY CONVERSATION TO TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE -- SO HAVING SAID THAT MANUFACTURERS NEED CERTAINTY AND WE NEED PREDICTABILITY IN ORDER TO THRIVE -- WE ENCOURAGE POLICYMAKERS TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND RESOLUTIONS AND SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO ATTACK THE NARROW IN ISOLATED INCIDENTS IN THESE BROAD SWEEPING POLICY AND MISSION S. -- THAT ARE INCOME NATURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING -- OPERATIONS -- MANUFACTURING IS IN UNIQUE WE'RE NOT LIKE THE SERVICE INDUSTRIES WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU KNOW THE PROFESSIONAL -- OFFICE INDUSTRIES THAT YOU SEE -- OUR COMPETITION IS GLOBAL OUR JOBS ARE REQUIRE HIGH SKILL OUR OPERATIONS ARE IT HERE TOO STRICT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES -- OR BUT OUR MANUFACTURING JOBS SUPPORT TWO POINT FIVE ADDITIONAL JOBS IN THE ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE MANUFACTURING JOB THAT'S TWO POINT FIVE ADDITIONAL JOBS THAT WERE CREATING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE OPERATIONS AS I SAID BEFORE OUR SMALL THEY'RE NIMBLE. AND FRANKLY ARE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS CAN BE SERVICED FROM ANYWHERE. SO UNDERSTANDING THE UNIQUENESS OF MANUFACTURING IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO EXPLORE WITH THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR ARE TWO TOP PRIORITIES THIS YEAR OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO BRING BACK INCENTIVIZE -- INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR MANUFACTURING AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO BUILD OUT A SKILLED WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY AND TO SHOW THE LEGISLATURE THAT WHILE WE ARE BOTH USERS AND MAKERS OF THE TECHNOLOGY. WE ALSO HAVE A PLAN OF HOW OUR WORKERS CAN WORK ALONGSIDE WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY BUT AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE EVEN HIGHER SKILL SET WHICH IS GOING TO CHALLENGE POLICY MAKERS. TO INVEST EVEN MORE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND CAREER GOALS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE HOPING TO ESTABLISH WITH EITHER. YOU KNOW WHAT CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE OR THE ADMINISTRATION IS A MANUFACTURING COUNCIL BECAUSE WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE WE FORECAST THESE TRENDS WE KNOW THESE -- THESE PATHWAYS NEW OR SURPRISING TO US BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ANTICIPATING IT BUT WE NEED A FORM TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH POLICYMAKERS SO MANUFACTURING COUNCIL I HEARD EARLIER YOU KNOW IT'S BEYOND ADVISORY GROUPS WE TOTALLY AGREE. BUT WE DO NEED A STATE WIDE PLACE ONE PLACE SO WE'RE NOT AT MULTIPLE TABLES WHICH WAS SAID BEFORE WHERE WE CAN CONVENE AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT IS A CORNERSTONE INDUSTRY OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE TO THIS IS THAT WE OFTEN HEAR CALIFORNIANS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. WE NEED TO OF DEVELOP A NATION STATE MENTALITY AND IN ORDER TO HAVE A STRONG AND SUSTAINABLE NATION STATE WE HAVE TO HAVE A PRODUCTION INDUSTRY A STRONG AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION INDUSTRY THAT'S WHAT MANUFACTORY REPRESENTS. AND THAT'S WERE WERE EXCITED TO COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT -- ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS I WAS TALKING -- TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THE METAL TRADES INDUSTRY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID IS THAT. A LOT IF NOT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MEMBERS BECAUSE ASSOCIATION HAVE A BACKUP STRATEGY -- FOR MOVING. OR FOR EXPANDING WITH ANOTHER AREA AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S COMPETITION OUT THERE PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THESE PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEIR BUSINESSES THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A SAID IS DEVELOPING BACKUP STRATEGIES THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE WORK AFTER EXPAND WHERE THEY CAN AGO MICHIGAN. SPECIFIC -- TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE -- MANY REGIONS HAVE BEEN DOING WORK WITH THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE MACKENZIE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE REGIONAL ECONOMY -- THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS BEEN IN THAT PROCESS FOR LAST TWO YEARS IT'S CALLED -- ID GO THE INLAND GROWTH AN OPPORTUNE. GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE -- WE'RE ABOUT. TWO MONTHS AWAY FROM ANNOUNCING -- THE RESULTS OF THAT -- BUT IT REALLY IS -- TELLING US THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR STRENGTHS -- IN CREATING -- COALITIONS -- AROUND WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND OUR PLAYERS IN OUR BIGGEST -- SECTOR DRIVEN -- PARTS OF THE ECONOMY -- AND SO IN MANUFACTURING OF ANTS MANUFACTURING IS ONE OF THEM CERTAINLY THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SO THAT'S THAT'S COMING. THANK YOU. KNOW I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME TIME FOR A FEW MORE QUESTIONS BEFORE WE OPEN IT TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- JUST AS A MILLENNIAL IN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MILLENNIAL ENTREPRENEURS OUT -- IT WITH ALL PARTS OF CAL I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST MINDS -- OUT THERE WHO ARE YOUNG MILLENNIALS AND ARE. ARE SO CREATIVE INNOVATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL WHAT CAN THE STATE TO DO TO PLAY A SUPPORTING ROLE. TO ASSIST MILLENNIAL ENTREPRENEURS [inaudible] GOOD QUESTION. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE I'VE HAD TO SO I TURNED FIFTY ONE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT HAPPENS. DRIVE [inaudible] SOME -- THE THIS IN WOMEN THAN I WOULD -- KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE -- I I I HAVE LEARNED TO LISTEN TO MY MILLENNIAL STAFF RIGHT AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY -- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW -- MY PARENTS AND THE GEN X. RIGHT -- SO THERE WAS A FORMALITY -- MISTRUST SURE -- BUT I WE I THINK WE NEED TO BETTER TO EACH OTHER I THINK -- BOTH SIDES HAVE A LOT TO ADD OKAY AND JUST BECAUSE I STILL LIKE TO GO SHOP -- INSIDE OF YOU KNOW. OF GROUP THAT STORE RIGHT AND OTHERS DON'T -- THAT SHOULDN'T SEPARATE US SO I THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME PLACES WHERE WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THAT ARE NOT SO MUCH -- EVERYBODY IN THE CORNER RIGHT BUT COMING TOGETHER AND SAYING GOSH WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM EACH OTHER -- SO TOTALLY AGREE AND YOUR GREAT EXAMPLE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- ONE OF THE THINGS THIS IMPORT BECAUSE MILLENNIALS ARE INTERESTED IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND STARTING BUSINESSES AND THOSE THOSE KIND OF THINGS -- AND THAT GOES TO THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- ISSUE AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THEY CAN RAISE START UP CAPITAL GROWTH CAPITAL -- IT'S IT'S CRITICAL TO THEIR ABILITY -- TO TO GROW THRIVE EXIST THAT TECH. I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO PUNCTUATE THAT POINT AND AND YOURS AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOMEONE TASTE. TO TO STATE WHAT WE'RE SEEING AS FAR AS IN OUR INNOVATION ECONOMIES WHICH INCLUDES ADVANCED MANUFACTURING THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. YOU'RE SEEING YOUNG PEOPLE GET EXCITED -- ABOUT THE YOU KNOW ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ECONOMY AND STARTING UP THESE LITTLE COMPANIES IN THEIR GARAGE OR IN MAKER SPACES SO WE SEE A LOT OF THAT -- AGAIN TO PUNCTUATE DOT POINT THAT WHEN THEY'RE STARTING THEY HAVE DREAMS OF BECOMING BIGGER OR MORE -- I'M SUCCESSFUL MORE POSPER OF OF THE ECONOMY SO THEY DO NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY DO NEED OUR SUPPORT -- AND THAT INCLUDES WITH THE WORK FORCE I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I RUN IN ON TO INDIVIDUALS DURING MANUFACTURING DAVID'S HERE. IN IN CALIFORNIA IN OCTOBER AND THEY'RE SAYING YOU KNOW I WANT TO GROW I WANT EXPAND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE BUT I CAN'T FIND THE WORK FORCE. AND SO THE SUPPORT THAT WE GIVE THEM FOR CAPITAL BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT BUT ALSO FOR CREATING THIS PIPELINE INTO INDUSTRIAL TRADE CAN HELP SUPPORT THE INNOVATION THE INNOVATION. IS NEEDS TO BE SCALED UP IN ITS THE SCALING UP OF THAT THAT PRODUCES THIS PRODUCTION THIS THIS NATION STATE MENTALITY ALL GO BACK TO AGAIN. THAT IF WE'RE JUST SEATING IDEAS IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS INTO THE SCALING UP AND PRODUCTION MASS PRODUCTION OF THOSE IDEAS WERE GOING TO MISS OUT ON OPPORTUNITY. I'D ALSO -- SAY ONE LAST THING. I NOTICE JUST HEARING FEEDBACK FROM MY COMPANIES THAT MILLENNIALS DON'T SEE WORK IN THE WORLD OF WORK LIKE WE NEED TO ADD I'M EVEN ON THE EDGE OF THAT MYSELF FOR I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE BEFORE AND I'VE SEEN THE EVOLUTION. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR NIMBLE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND FLEXIBILITY THERE LOOKING FOR LOTS OF ON RAMPS AND OFF RAMPS BACK AND FORTH INTO CAREER AND INTO EDUCATION. SO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO EVOLVE WITH THE EXPECTATION OF THE MILLENNIALS AND THE GENERATION TO FOLLOW. AS TO WHAT THE GOAL OF A EASY IT IS ASSET AND IS NOT [inaudible] BUT IT'S CREATING PATHWAYS SO INDIVIDUALS CAN SEE WELL HOW THOSE PATHWAYS CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN STAYING SOMEWHERE. FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN NOT EVEN FIVE YEARS WE SEE THAT EVEN OUR OUR OWN CAPITAL COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. EVOLVES AND AND FOR FEELS THAT EXPECTATION. RECORD JUST ADD SOMETHING TO THAT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGY I HEAR A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS SAYING. INSTEAD OF WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS TECHNOLOGY AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN EVERYBODY TO DO IT. THAT THEY'LL JUST GIVE THE TEAM THE TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THEY'LL LET THE TEAM FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT IT -- THAT'S IT THAT'S A BIG CHANGE AND I THINK THE MORE WE CAN. LEARN FROM THAT I THINK THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE. WANTED OPEN UP -- TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY LAST QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I I DO HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION BEFORE WE CLOSE -- WITH THIS SECTION HERE WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THE STATE CAN TAKE TO SUPPORT. UPWARD MOBILITY. SO. I THINK. THIS ISSUE OF A REGIONAL FOCUS -- THE NATION STATE IF WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY -- IF WE WERE A COUNTRY WE ARE I MEAN THE UNITED STATES -- IN THE DIFFERENT STATES OF THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THERE FOCUSED ON SECTOR BASS STRATEGIES -- WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT US AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND DO THE SAME DO THE SAME IN REGIONS AS WE APPROACH. THESE ISSUES OF GROWTH OF WORKFORCE TRAINING OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HIT OUR CLIMATE GOALS -- AND YET WE MAKE WE WE ARE PROTECTED IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING BUT I THINK THAT WOULD. RISE TO THE TOP OF MY LIST THANK YOU. A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THAT -- FIRST AND FOREMOST -- A LOT OF THIS IS BEEN FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT TO ME IS VERY KEY WE CANNOT ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE CAN'T -- TO INNOVATES WE CAN'T -- EXPAND OUR ECONOMY WITHOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE WORK FORCE THAT REFLECTS THE NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE ECONOMY. SO TO THAT END MATE REALLY MAIN STREAMING CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NOT SO THAT IT'S A ONE OFF FOR THAT AFTERTHOUGHT OR THE THING THAT WE FIND AFTER. IT TO REALLY BE AN INTEGRATED PART OF AN EDUCATION EXPERIENCE WITH TRAINING FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS AGAIN THOSE ON RAMPS AND OFF RAMPS CREATING OPTIONS AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE SIMPLY MEMBER. FOR INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THEY CAN YOU KNOW INFO AT THAT WILL INFORM THEIR CAREER PATH. IN THEIR EDUCATION EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE -- THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE YOU KNOW KIND OF CHANGING THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THE DELIVERY OF THE SYSTEM AND ALSO THE FUNDING MECHANISMS ALSO WE CAN'T HAVE INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE TEACHERS. SO WE NEED TO BUILD OUR WORK FORCE OF TEACHERS THEY NEED TO BE EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY IN ACADEMICS BUT ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN INDUSTRY IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIGH QUALITY RELEVANT PROGRAMS. SO THE PHILS THAT THEY'RE CONCENTRATED AND THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AND ALSO SOME SUPPORT FROM THEIR STATEWIDE PARTNERS AS WELL. WE NEED TO DEVELOP IT WAS BUT BE ON THE TRADITIONAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH IN OUR INDUSTRY WORKS BETTER FOR OUR LARGER MANUFACTURERS NOT SO MUCH FOR OUR SMALL ONES FOR WHAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOUNDATION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE HOURS THAT NEED TO BE RECORDED THAT YOU KNOW THAT TRAINING AND HAVING SOMEBODY BE GONE OUT OF THE OPERATION FOR CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF TIMES DURING THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE. SO WE NEED TO HAVE EARNING LEARN PROGRAMS THAT CAN WORK FOR ALL INDUSTRIES. AND FINALLY. AGAIN I MENTIONED THIS BEFORE IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO SUCCEED AND TO HAVE SUSTAINABLE CAREERS WITH LIVABLE WAGES CALIFORNIA MUST PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLEGE A AND CAREER. THE GOAL OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE A COLLEGE DEGREE IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL AND FULFILLING AND SUSTAINABLE CAREER AND NOT WILL ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE OPTIONS THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATHWAYS. AND THEY WILL REALLY FEEL EMPOWERED AND BE ABLE -- TO ENGAGE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY ECONOMY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY -- I'D LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE THE ASPECT OF EDUCATION. AND COLLEGE RUSSES. APPRENTICESHIP AND THAT THAT TAPE WITH ME IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A INTERNAL BATTLE WITHIN THE DIFFERENT SECTORS. OF THE COMMUNITY OF THESE PEOPLE I KNOW I WAS INVOLVED. IN AND I EVEN FORGET WHAT THE ORGANIZATION WAS BUT I HAD THE GUY CALLED ME UP AND HE SAID THE GUY WHO WAS THE HEAD OF THE COMMUNITY. AND HE SAID SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF EDUCATION? AND HIS BAND WAS COLLEGE. AND DO IS AN INTERNAL BATTLE GOING ON THAT'S GOT TO STOP -- THERE'S A PLACE FOR BOTH. MEDICS IMPORTANT THAT WE EMPHASIZE THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR COLLEGE THERE'S A ROLE FOR COMMUNITY COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIR TO ROSE FOR FRIENDSHIPS. AND THOSE THOSE ALL NEED TO BE. TOGETHER AND WORK ON TOWARDS REACHING TE FINAL. I AGREE VENTURE IT IF I COULD JUST OUT ONE LAST THING -- I DON'T KNOW TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT AND PERSPECTIVE SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU. BUT IF MY PLUMBING GOES OUT IF MY CAR STOPS WORKING IF MY ROOF STARTS LEAKING IF THE ELECTRICITY DOESN'T WORK IN MY HOUSE OF MY SOLAR SYSTEM. GOES DOWN MY LAW DEGREE IS NOT GOING TO HELP ME IN FIXING ANY OF THAT AND THE NARRATIVE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT WE AS AS POLICY MAKERS HAVE CREATED THE NARRATIVE. THAT COLLEGE IS THE IT'S THAT THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO KIND OF BUILDING THIS SKILLED WORKFORCE IS THE NARRATIVE THAT WE PUT OUT AND THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED. TO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN START REALLY FOCUSING ON COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS AND REALLY MAKING THE GOAL OF EDUCATION. A CAREER A SUCCESSFUL SUSTAINABLE LIVING WAGE PRODUCING CAREER THEN I THINK WE WILL HELP TO KIND OF ROLL BACK SOME OF THESE BIASES. THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THEN START CREATING THIS WELL ROUNDED SOCIETY WHERE YOU HAVE ACADEMICS AND YOU HAVE TECHNICAL SKILLS WORKING TOGETHER. WONDERFUL WELL I I DO WANT TO CLOSE I'D THIS SO -- PANEL BY SAYING THANK YOU TO EACH OF YOU FOR PARTICIPATING AND MAKING YOUR WAY -- FROM ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA TO BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS -- IF THERE ARE THOSE WHO WISH TO SPEAK UP PLEASE.

MAYBE BRINGING IN SOME OF THE LABOR FOLKS MY IN IN WORKING WITH.

CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS PRE SHEET THIS DISCUSSION THAT THAT WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION IN VERY MUCH AGREED WITH EVERYTHING. WHO SHARED APPRECIATE THAT COUPLE JUST A COUPLE THOUGHTS ON TOP OF MY HEAD BOTH -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO AS A PARENT OF TWO HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA -- ONE THOUGHT AS IT RELATES TO THE IT INCREASING THE IMPRINT APPRENTICESHIPS IN THE BUILDING TRADES AND JUST ASKING TO KEEP IN MIND OTHER AREAS SUCH AS A RESTAURANT TRADES RETAIL SO MANY OTHER AREAS THAT REALLY NEED SKILLED WORKERS. THOUGHT THAT CAME TO MY MIND THAT WOULD BE GREAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW I JUST THINKING OF MY BET YEARS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL IN SOUTHERN CAL AND UP HERE WITH MY CHILDREN EVEN NOW -- TO THE EXTENT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCENTIVIZE SMALL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND HE MAY BE BACK EVEN TO MIDDLE SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CAREER FAIRS AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES I THINK EVEN AS FAR BACK IN MIDDLE SCHOOL WHEN. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO THINK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH SCHOOL JOBS -- THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY -- TRANSLATE INTO YES IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE THE THE LARGER CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES SHOW UP BUT TO THE EXTENT THERE SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES. ARE MEMBER SCOTT'S AND OTHERS THAT COULD BE INCENTIVIZE SOMEHOW I JUST A TOP OF MIND TOP IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM SOME PEOPLE. A SECOND COMMENT WAS JUST VERY QUICKLY WAS YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW TO MAKE REGULATIONS SMARTER -- AND MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE I COULD NOT IN AGREE WITH SCOTT HOW CAN MORE THAN I THINK A LOT OF THE AGENCIES AREN'T TALKING TO EACH OTHER OFTENTIMES SO TO THE EXTENT. THERE'S A CHANCE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF DIALOGUE HERE WITHIN THE CAPITAL BUT TO THE EXTENT THERE'S A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE LEAGUE TO THE C. SACK. TO RURAL COUNTIES ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS AND THEN FRANKLY -- FOLKS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS A MUST BE A MULTI LEVEL AT A DISCUSSION ABOUT -- THESE CONFLICTS COMPLETELY AS I'M SURE YOU'VE HELP STIMULATE SOME OF THAT DISCUSSION BUT TO THE EXTENT THOSE THREE LEVELS CAN HAVE MORE OF A DIALOGUE TO BE GREAT AND IT FINALLY JUST TO THE EXTENT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE. RIGHT TO CORRECT PERIODS I THINK OFTENTIMES THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT A RIGHT TO CORRECT PERIOD MEANS THAT. EMPLOYERS SMALL EMPLOYERS ARE ANY LEVEL OR JUST TRYING TO GET AROUND A LOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST SO BUSY IN THEIR DAY TO DAY AS SCOTT MENTIONED IN IS A A TO HURT OTHER STATES PAUL AND OTHERS SAY TODAY. SO THAT RIGHT TO CORRECT PERIOD WHETHER IT'S OSHA -- VIA VIOLATIONS ORAL ALLEGATIONS OR YOU KNOW LOT LEGAL AREAS -- THE EXTENT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SMALL EMPLOYERS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE DOINGWRONG AND HAVE A CHANCE TO CORRECT IT. I THINK MOST OF THEM ARE WILLING TO DO THAT SO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IN THIS DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU SO MUCH.

NUMBER TO THE CALIFORNIA -- WORK FOR SPORT TO BRING BACK -- LOWERING BARRIERS TO ENTRANCE FOR PARTNERSHIP AND CALIFORNIA AND NUMBER THREE EDGE ON HOW TO LOWER BARRIERS. GETTING INTO EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND USING THINGS SUCH AS CLEP EXAMS -- STANDARDIZING COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO -- THE UNITS FROM ONE COLLEGE ARE ACCEPTED BY ANOTHER COLLEGE. AND WITH A CALIFORNIA STATE COLLEGES ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY LIKE TO HAVE THEIR OWN IN THEIR OWN DISTRICT. YOU NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT AND ACCEPT ALL EDUCATION SO IS TRANSFERABLE I THINK WE NEED BOTH THE CAREERS. AND I THINK WE NEED -- COLLEGE ALSO WHAT WAS MENTIONED IS -- WHAT ARE MILLENNIALS LOOKING? FOR HELLO BARRIER OF ENTRY. WHETHER IT'S INTO THE WORK FORCE OR INTO A CAREER OR EDUCATION. SO WE OUGHT NOT BE TAXING CELL PHONES AND THE INTERNET OR OVER TAXING IT IN CREATING MORE BARRIERS.

ITS BARRIERS TO THE MARKET PLACE THEY'RE ALL LOOKING FOR TALENT. THEY WILL PAY MORE MONEY THEY WILL LOCATE IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE. IF IN RETURN THERE'S A TALENTED WORKFORCE THEIR TALENTED WORKFORCE CAN COME FROM HIGH SCHOOL CAN COME FROM CREE ATTACK CAN COME FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WORKING COME FROM A COLLEGE.
