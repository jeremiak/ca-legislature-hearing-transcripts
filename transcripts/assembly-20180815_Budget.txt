THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING WE'RE HEARING SEVERAL. CLEAN UP BILLS I HAVE A FEW NEW TECHNICAL ISSUES TODAY. O. IN ADDITION WE WILL BE VOTING ON EACH BILL INCLUDING -- THREE BILLS WHICH OUR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE ITEMS AND WILL BE HAVING PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER EACH BILL. SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH S. B. EIGHT SIX TWO WHICH IS AMENDMENT TO OUR BUDGET BELT BERMAN FINANCE. THANK YOU CARL BECAUSE THE OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M S. B. EIGHT SIXTY TWO MAKES A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO THE BUDGET ACT. IT LARGELY -- ADDS A REVISES ENCUMBRANCE STATES IN LIQUIDATION DATES A MIX IF YOU CORRECTIONS TO FISCAL YEAR REFERENCES AND CODE REFERENCES. AND THEN PROVIDES A FEW -- FEDERAL FUND UPDATES THAT THE GRANTS WERE PROVIDED AT THE AFTER THE BUDGET ACT AS WILLIS A FEW SPECIAL. BUT APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS IN THE CAN AND MISTER OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO ORIGINALLY IS WRITTEN THIS TRAILER BILL -- ALLOCATED UP TO AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS HAVE UPON THE DMV'S REQUEST. TO BE USED FOR REDUCING WAIT TIMES AT FIELD OFFICES. BY I'M LOOKING AT AN AMENDMENT. HERE'S HAS AMENDMENT EIGHTEEN WHICH I'VE HAD FOR AN HOUR -- CAN I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT DID TO THAT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR CAP. TECH CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANT WHAT THE AMENDMENT DOES NOW THAT DIFFERS FROM THE ORIGINAL BILL. SURE MARK NO PART FINANCE AND YEAH THAT THE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WAS -- AN INITIAL ESTIMATE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF QUICK YOU KNOW [inaudible] RESPONDING TREINTA. I TRY TO SOLVE THE IN OTHERS WAY TIME ISSUES THE DMV AND THAT WAS IT A QUICK ESTIMATE I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IN THE END -- THE IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS TAKEN OUT AND WHAT'S REPLACED WITH IT IS LANGUAGE THAT WELL -- REQUIRE THE DMV -- TO IDENTIFY THE REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH WHATEVER POSITION. THEY COME IN WITH. SO WHAT'S THE NEW CAP ON WHAT THEY CAN ASK. FOR THERE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY A DOLLAR CAP IN. IN THE LANGUAGE IT WOULD JUST BE WHATEVER THINK I'M JUSTIFIED. ANYTHING THEY ASK. FOR ANYTHING THAT THEY JUSTIFIED -- OKAY THE ARMY DECLARE FIGHTS UPON APPROVAL BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A BLANKET THE APPROPRIATION IT IS UPON APPROVAL BY THE ALLEGED -- ACTUALLY MISTER CHAIR AFTER RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU I THINK THEY'RE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THE COMMITTEE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL BUT I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE IN THIS BILL THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO APPROVE IT. AND THAT'S BY A BIG PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH THIS AMENDMENT -- IT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE PERFORMS A VITAL FUNCTION IN SAFEGUARDING THAT MONEY AND PROVIDING A LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OVER THAT MONEY. AND ESPECIALLYIN LIGHT OF THE HEARINGS THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR WE ARE BUT YOUR LAST WEEK WE HAD A BUDGET SUB SIX HEARING. LAST WEEK AND THEN A JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE HEARING IN WHICH THE DMV TESTIFIED THAT. OTHER REALLY COULDN'T TELL US WHY WE PAID SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION OF THEM TO REDUCE -- THE WAIT TIMES ARE FIELD OFFICES IN OPEN SIXTY FIELD OFFICES ON SATURDAYS. ARE THEY OPEN SOME FIELD OFFICES ON SATURDAYS LAST YEAR IN JAIL THIS YEAR IN JANUARY AND THEN CURTAIL THEM -- AND WHEN I ASK HOW MUCH MONEY WAS LEFT THEY SAID NONE IT ALL BEEN SPENT IN THE IF THEY COULDN'T JUSTIFY YOU KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY HAD GONE AND SO I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH. GIVING THEM ESSENTIALLY A BLANK CHECK -- WITHOUT ANY KIND OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- AND I WISH I WAS I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO VOTING YES ON THIS -- WERE ALL MOTIVATED TO TRY AND REDUCE THOSE DO IT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IS MISGUIDED. YOU KNOW MISTER OBERNOLTE AYE AYE COMPLETELY ON CONCUR ON THE LEGISLATURE APPROVAL OF NAFTA. QUESTION GRIFFITH ACHIEVE CONSULTORES. COMMENT ON THE AMENDMENT NUMBER EIGHTEEN WHICH YOU FRAUD REFER. TO QUESTION GOV OTHER THE SOME THE BUDGET MANY THE CONVENTION OF JAIL BC WORKS IN SUCH A WENT ONE WERE NOTIFIED IF THERE'S YOU THERE'S A DATE AND THERE'S THAT'S WHY THERE'S A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS THERE. IN THE NOTIFICATION IF THE JAIL PROCEED NON CONCURS. WITH THE LATTER SENDS A LETTER THIS IS THEY TALK OCCUR. THE APPROACH BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATED AND SO THAT'S BEEN THE CONVENTION WE FOLLOWED AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE ABLE. TO ALLOW FOR FUNDING TO BE ADDED WHILE THE LEGISLATURE'S NON SESSIONS TO THEIR CONTINUED BE DISCUSSIONS OF THE INTENT OF THIS LANGUAGE HERE. IS TO NOT. FRAME THE DMZ AUGMENTATION AROUND A TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING LEVEL IS TO FRAME AROUND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO REDUCE WAIT TIME SO THAT WE ACTUALLY GET OUTCOME DIFFERENCE. CHANGE THE OUTCOME FROM IN A DIFFERENT DAY ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION AND THE CONVERSATION TO BE THAT WAY TIMES AS OPPOSED TO FRAMING. THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION AROUND AND NUMBER WHICH WITH THAT. KIND OF LEAD TO THAT OUTCOME DID HERE THAT YOU REFERENCED EARLIER IN THE HEARING WHERE WE ADDED MONEY WERE REALLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD CHANGE THE OUTCOME WHICH IS WHAT WHERE REAL. CONCERNS. SO DO JUST GOOD JUST AND OTHER DISTRICT REPLICATION DOWN. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TWENTY SIX MILLION WITH THE TWENTY SIX MONEY WAS THE CORRECT NUMBER MAYBE WAVES HIGH MAYBE WAS LOW. BED -- EITHER WAY BASED ON THAT PREVIOUS HEARING IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY HAD NOT BROUGHT FORTH ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO JUSTIFY A SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS SO THAT'S WHY. THE WE HAD ASKED THAT THEY COME BACK AND BASICALLY COME BACK TO US DURING RECESS AND THEN JAIL PC COMMITTEE WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT WHILE WE WERE. WHILE WE WERE OUT. OKAY I UNDERSTAND I I WOULD FEEL A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF -- AN EXPLICIT APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE SAID IS THAT IT'S CONVENTION THAT ONCE THEY GIVE US A NOTICE IF WE DISAGREE WITH THAT WE CAN HOLD A HEARING. BUT THAT'S NOT THEM IN THE LEGISLATION DOES NOT SAY THAT WE HAVE THE BILL NOW IF IF WE DON'T CONCURRENT THAT IT WOULD THE APPROPRIATIONS NOT OCCUR. THAT'S THE CADETS A CONVENTION FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DIDN'T WANNA. NAM NOT ALLOW THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY WHEN WE HE WANTED -- TO GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE OKAY OUR I REALLY WISH THAT WE HAD APPROVED ON AUDIT OF HOW THAT MONEY WAS SPENT THE LAST TIME WE NEED AN ALLOCATION. LIKE THIS THAT WOULD GIVE ME A LOT MORE COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE COULD WRITE THEM ESSENTIALLY A BLANK CHECK AND EXPECT THE PROBLEM TO GET SOLVED IT ON A PORCH I DON'T HAVE THAT COMFORT. WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL INCENTIVIZE TO TRY AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. LAW AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THIS COMMITTEE HAS COMPLETE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE DID AND SO ON IF THERE ARE CONCERNS REGARDING THAT -- MORE THAN HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AND DISCUSS ABOUT HOW THIS COMMITTEE CAN PURSUE THAT. BUT WITHOUT MISS MELINDA'S. BEFORE YOU CAN WE KALRA. KILEY KALRA PERSONAL TING [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] ARAMBULA [inaudible] BLOOM. BROWN HAIR CARRERA [inaudible] CHAVEZ [inaudible] CHIU [inaudible] CHOI COOPER. FONG HERE HARPER. JONES SAWYER KALRA. LACKEY HERE. MATHIS THEIR MCCARTY MEDINA AIRS MELENDEZ. MULLIN MURATSUCHI O'DONNELL. PATTERSON RADIUS RUBIO STONE [inaudible] VOEPEL [inaudible] WEBER [inaudible] WHAT? THANK YOU THIS MONTH'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN UP SO. THE VICE CHAIR ALREADY ASKED MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ON MY MIND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF I GUESS REPORT. THAT REYES RECORDER STANDARD THAT IT THAT IS SET TO THAT -- WE UNDERSTAND WHICH DMV OFFICES WILL BE. INSTITUTING HOURS ON SATURDAY OR OVER YOU NO LONGER HOURS IS IS THIS UNIFORM ACROSS ALL DMV OFFICES IN THE STATE. HOW IS THAT DECIDED? YES THE DMP IS-- DIRECTING A NEW STAFF TO THE OFFICES WITH THE THE GREATEST NEED. AND DUMB AND THE LANGUAGE AS AN INTENDED TO REPORT ON EXACTLY HOW THAT WAS DONE SO -- SAID THEY'LL DECIDE WHICH OFFICES HAVE THE GREATEST NEED AND THEN ASSIGN SATURDAY HOURS OR ADDITIONAL HOURS DURING THE WEEK TO THE TOPS IS THAT RIGHT NOTICING. WELL YES -- AND ALSO THE STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE [inaudible] OKAY BECAUSE I JUST -- IN GOING THROUGH. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT DMV OFFICES AND SAYING THERE. REALLY I CAN'T FIND ANY THAT DON'T HAVE KIND ENOUGH OF A LONG WAIT SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OFFICES IN THIS STATE THAT WON'T GET THOSE EXTRA HOURS THAT REALLY NEED THEM JUST AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTY SAN TURN FORGET. HOW WE MAKE THAT FAIR AND EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE IF IT'S GOING TO BE -- SOMEWHAT ARBITRARILY DECIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF -- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I I'M NOT TRYING TO THIS ISN'T A GOTCHA THIS IS GENUINE CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WILL BE. YOU KNOW STILL WAITING IN A VERY LONG LINES ARE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE. ESSENTIALLY -- UNLIMITED FUNDS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS ASKED FOREIGN JUSTIFIED FOR THAT PART I THINK IT'S ARE COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE AND DOWN IN A VERY VERY GOOD QUESTION AND FACT THE QUESTION I ASKED -- W. DIRECTOR WHEN I MET WITH. HIM ON MONDAY WOULD BE HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WOULD WELCOME ANY MEMBER ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OR ANY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY IF THEY WANT TO JOIN IN ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPY. TO ON THE DE DEPUTY COULD NOT SPECIFY EXACTLY THE METHODOLOGY THAT I ASKED EXACT IN QUESTION. HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHERE YOU ALLOCATE RESOURCES? WHAT ARE THEY DOING ON THE HEAT HE DID SHOW ME? THAT BASED ON THEIR BEST CALCULATION OF WAIT TIMES WHERE THERE WERE WITH THE WORST WAIT TIMES WHICH WERE NOT WHICH OF THE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO SHARE WITH. SO THEY CAN GET A KIND OF OF A GAS OF WHERE WHERE THINGS ARE -- HAVING THE MOST PRESSURE BUT HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT'S ON ACTUALLY PROPER THAT WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP AND UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED. SO THAT AGAIN THESE WAIT TIMES WHICH AGAIN ARE STATEWIDE ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED ACROSS THE BOARD SUB POP UPS LOW AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED HAPPY -- TO INCLUDE ANYONE AND FURTHER A PROPER [inaudible] PART [inaudible] MR MATHIS. SO MY MY QUESTION GOES ALONG SOME THE SAME LINES. I ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE DMV OFFICE AND SAID I WANT TO SIT DOWN AND NO ACTUALLY OTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT A WHAT. WHAT D. V. ACTUALLY NEEDS TO TO HELP GET THEM IN FIX SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS? ON PART OF THE CONVERSATION INVOLVED KIOSK -- THE FACT THE THE OTHER SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH KIOSK IN THERE'S HIGH PROPENSITY AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE KIOSK -- IN IN I THINK THE THE CHAIR CHYNA ANSWER PART OF THE QUESTION FOR YOU INSANE YOU YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW WHERE. THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY GONNA GO BUT IT BUT I'D LIKE TO NOW YOU KNOW HOW MANY KEY OSCAR GASOLINE UPSWING IN -- EXTENDING HOURS A IN IN THESE THINGS BLADE CURRENT FROM THE ANSWERS WERE GETTING -- APPEAR ALREADY TODAY YOU GUYS SEEM TO NOT KNOW THOSE. I MEAN CAN YOU. SEAN SOME LIGHT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. YES I THINK SO IN TERMS OF THE KIOSKS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THESE ARE THE AUTOMATED -- YES SELF SERVICE TERMINALS WE CALL THEM -- AND SO THE OTHER NUMBER OF THEM IN DMV OFFICES AND THEN A FEW YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN BEGIN PUTTING THEM IN RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS. AND SO THERE IS A A PROCESS FOR THAT. I THINK IN TERMS OF USING THOSE KIOSKS -- IT'S SIMILAR TO WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE WORD THE DMV IS GOING UP POSITIONS -- THE TREND OVER ADDRESS WHERE WHERE THAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST SOCIALS PART OF THE THE PROCESS IN THE PLANNING WITH THIS -- UNLIMITED FUN THAT YOU GUYS ARE ASKING FOR IS. TO IMPROVE MAYBE SOME OF THOSE KIOSK IN RETAIL OUTLETS IN IN THOSE THINGS AS WELL. AS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED. I BELIEVE SO YES. THE DEBATE IN THAT MEETING THAT I HAD ON MONDAY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DID -- THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN ON ALL OF US WERE IN THEM MEANING IN THIS I'M TWENTY AND YOU'RE ABOUT CRIED DOMINATE YOUR QUESTION ON THIS RIGHT. GO FOR MY QUESTIONS FOR THEM SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT'S FUN THINKING THAT. THAT THEY DO HAVE A SPECIFIC PLAN FOR KIOSKS ON MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THEY LOOK AT A CONTRACT AND ARE EXPANDING THOSE OPTIONS ARE AROUND THE STATE AND THEY HAVE NOT THEY DID NOT TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEPLOYED. BUT THEY HAVE MORE THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED. AND THEN YOU AT I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PUBLIC KNOWS. WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN THEY'RE MEETING WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN IT IT DOESN'T GET OUT TO THE PUBLIC ON WHAT THESE PLANTS ARE? IN A ANY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR PUBLIC ESPECIALLY WITH WITHOUT HAVING AN AUDIT. AND IN HAVING THESE THINGS IN IN TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS LATER ONE OR NOT IN SESSION AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF OUR PUBLIC SOURCE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. THE SHEET IS IT BEING DONE -- AND IN THE DARK OF NIGHT AND NOT BEING A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY AND SO I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UPSET. BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING THAT WAY THE INFORMATION IS NOT GETTING OUT AND THEN WITH THE AUDIT NOT HAPPENING THERE'S EVEN MORE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ASKED. SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING WITH OUR DMV IN WITH. OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS GOOD GOOD WITH MORE WHICH IS WHY CHAIR THAT HEARING ALL LAST WEEK -- WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP HEARINGS AND I BELIEVE THAT -- BASED ON THIS IT'S TO COME IN ON US AS AS MESSENGERS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO TRY. TO LIKE GET THATINFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL SO I I COMPLETELY IT OCCURRED CURRENT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE. FAR GREATER TRANSPARENCY GREATER OPENNESS AND COM I'M GLAD YOU AGREE ON TRANSPARENCY LOOK FOR TO THAT ON IT [inaudible] MR FUNG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I THINK THE HESITANCY I THINK A LOT OF US TO ACTUALLY APPLY THE CHAIRMAN FOR FOR HIS PUSH FOR PLAN. AS IS THAT VERY REASON WE'RE LOOKING FOR A PLAN FROM THE DMV I KNOW THAT THERE'S FOCUS ON KIOSKS FOCUS ON STAFF TO FOCUS ON RESOURCE IS THERE. A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT THE DMV IS GOING TO PROVIDE US. SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THAT ALONG WITH WITH ANY FUNDING REQUESTS TO TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE WHETHER. THE FUNDING AND THE PLAN WORKS. I WOULD SAY YES IF -- WE GOING TO THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IT'S BEING -- CONSIDERED HERE -- IT PROVIDES FOR THAT SORT OF REPORTING AND THE DESCRIPTION INTO FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT HOW THEY'VE USED THAT. WE HOPE RESOURCES THEY'VE RECEIVED SO FAR AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE TO NEW RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO THIS SO THIS PLAN HAS TO BE PRODUCED AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FUNDING REQUEST. YES AND WHAT METRICS ARE THEY USING A ME IS. IS THERE A SPECIFIC WAY TIME THAT INTERNALLY THEY NEED TO MEET IS IT FIFTEEN MINUTES IS IT. THIRTY MINUTES OVER WHAT WHAT METRICS ARE THE UTILIZING I'M. SO IN TERMS OF MEET YES IT'S COULD TELL BASED ON WAIT TIMES -- HISTORICALLY THEIR TARGET HAS BEEN IF YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT -- THAT YOUR AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN APPOINTMENT YOUR SEEN WITHIN FORTY FIVE MINUTES NOT TO SAY THAT. SAID THAT THE IDEA IS TO MAKE IT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE THAT THOSE THOSE KIND OF BEEN THEIR TARGET WAIT TIMES. AND SO -- THOSE WAIT TIMES HAVE GROWN CONSIDERABLY AND THEIR GOAL IS TO GET BACK TO THAT -- AS AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW TERMS OF IT'S NOT THAT AND UP. AT ANOTHER THERE'S A WOULD LIKE TO GET DOWN TO AN HOUR IF YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET BACK TO THAT SO THEN. FOR US AS THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR THE CHAIRMAN IS THAT IT'S A WE CORRECT INTO TO EVALUATE THE DMV BASED ON THOSE WAY TYPES SO IF THEY WERE TO REQUEST. AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHOULD EVALUATE THEIR SUCCESS OR INABILITY TO ACHIEVE THOSE WAIT TIMES BASED ON THE FIFTEEN MINUTE. OR WHATEVER CRITERIA THAT THEY BALLOT. I WOULD SAY THAT DOES WAIT TIMES THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TESTIFIED AS BEING THERE STANDARD THAT'S KIND OF THAT THE BAR THEY HOLD THEMSELVES. TO BUT AND SO THE WAY THIS LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN. ANY AUGMENTATION THIS WAS TO IDENTIFY -- HOW HOW IS THIS REDUCING THOSE WAIT TIMES? SO AND ASK THE QUESTION DEVOID OF I THINK IT'S IT'S A I'M I'M BEING A LITTLE I'M NOT I GUESS I'M BEING MAYBE A LITTLE CONFUSING THAT SHOULD BE. HOW DOES THE DMV DEFINE SUCCESS? I WOULD BE. IN IN IN OTHER HEARINGS I THINK THEY HAVE TESTIFIED THAT. IN TERMS OF WAIT TIMES THEIR SUCCESS IS MEETING THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE MINUTE TIMEFRAME. AND SO -- DID WHEN THEY ASK FOR NAY RESOURCES THEY'LL HAVE TO BE EXPLAINING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE CURRENT WAIT TIME IS. AND HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO REDUCE THAT WAIT TIME AND BY HOW MUCH OKAY BECAUSE I THINK THE CHAIRMAN IS CORRECT ASK FOR PLAN I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE ARE ALL OF US SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT PLAN. BASED ON WHAT IT SHOULD BE AND SO IF IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEY'RE ASKING. FOR TWENTY SIX MILLION OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THAT IF THEY DON'T MEET THAT THEN THEY SHOULD BE UP FRONT AND SAY THEY DIDN'T MEET THAT AND THAT THEY SHOULD REEVALUATE THEIR PROCESS. MY CORRECT TO ASSUME THAT. WELL YES IN THAT WELL. I WOULD SAY YES [inaudible] BUT IF THEY WERE TO COME IN FOR REQUEST SAFER TWENTY SIX MILLION. AND IT'S X. NUMBER OF POSITIONS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY -- WHAT THAT HOW THAT'S BRINGING DOWN THE WAIT TIME AND SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR NUMBERS THE RIGHT NUMBER -- BUT WHATEVER THAT DOLLAR IS IT'S GOING DEL VALLE YES IT WILL TELL YOU WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO AND WHAT THE BY HOW MUCH THEY ANTICIPATE THAT REDUCING WAIT TIMES OKAY Y. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CHAIRMAN'S FUTURE HEARINGS AND LOOK FOR THEM TO DEFINE. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO FIFTEEN A FORTY FIVE MINUTE WAIT TIMES? I THINK IT WAS BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT -- THAT YOU REFERENCED -- EARLIER AND AND LIKE A CHAIR BUDGET SUB THREE THAT HAS OVERSIGHT OVER -- AT THE AT DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. ON A I REGRET THAT I WASN'T AT THE HEARING. LAST WEEK I WAS TOURING -- THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER OF THE OF THE CAR FIRE. THAT DAY AND UNFORTUNATELY WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT CAUGHT FIRE BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT -- THAT WE OVERSEE AND I I WOULD LIKE. TO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HIGHER PERFORMING DEPARTMENTS THAT WE OVERSEE -- AND SO I SEE THIS -- A CURRENT SITUATION AS AN ABERRATION FROM FROM THE NORM AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY -- ARE EASY TO CORRECT -- A WE KNOW WHAT A OF SOME OF THE CAUSES ARE -- FOR THE DELAYS OR WAS IT -- AND AYE IT CLEARLY IT WAS NOT -- THE EXTENT OF THE WORKLOAD WAS NOT PROPERLY ANTICIPATED BY BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION ABOUT -- WAIT TIMES AS A METRIC OF EVERY TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COMES AND IT PROVIDES -- THEIR UPDATE TO US THEY ALWAYS TELL US ABOUT WAIT TIMES AS BEING ONE OF THEIR METRICS AND I'M QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY WILL DO THAT AGAIN BUT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT. CUSTOMER SERVICE AS A AS A METRIC A AT THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO SERVE. THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY THAT THEY GET FROM CUSTOMERS AND THIS IS SO ONE OF OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT INTERFACES WITH THE PUBLIC MORE SO THAN -- THAN MOST -- AND IT'S GOOD THAT QUE OUR CUSTOMER CENTRIC AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND REQUIRED THAT WE WANT TO MORE THAN ENCOURAGED IN ONE WEEK. CHOIR THEM TO TO BE THAT WAY AND AND A LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE -- I REALLY MET THE MARK AND THE FEEDBACK THAT I'VE RECEIVED OVER TIME UNTIL NOW HOW ABOUT -- ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN -- VERY POSITIVE PARTICULARLY COMPARED TO YEARS AGO WHEN -- I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES WAS -- NOT SEEN IT WAS IT WAS YOU KNOW WAS SEEN AS THAT PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD GO ONE WAY AND NEVER GET SERVE TEN AND AND WITH -- I DON'T THINK WATCHES CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WAS THE* OF MANY JOKES -- ABOUT -- A BUREAUCRACY AND WAIT TIMES AND THEY REALLY -- TURNED THAT AROUND SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS. UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IT EXISTS UP WE WILL APPROVE BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT HAD OVER THE DEPARTMENT IN THE COMING BUDGET CYCLE -- I'M QUITE CERTAINLY THAT CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXPAND OUR HEARING TIME FROM A WHAT WE NORMALLY DO WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND PERHAPS -- A RESERVE IN ENTIRE HEARING SO THAT WE CAN PERFORM SOME OF THE IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT AND TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. THAT -- OF THAT THE PUBLIC SO THAT IS SOMETHING GOT -- THAT WE WILL -- DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN THE COMING BUDGET CYCLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER. YES -- I WAS AT THE HEARING AND AND I THINK -- AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY WHERE WE'RE ASKING FOR TIME AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD AS TO HOW SOON SHOULD WE SEE. THE RESULTS OF THE LOVE OF THE INFUSION OF DOLLARS OF DOLLARS ARE PLACED INTO THIS AGAIN. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE OFTEN WE'VE ALREADY CREATED SOME PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN IT AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER NOT WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO RESPOND TO THOSE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS NOW. WHAT I'M HAD TO DO WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO GET APPOINTMENTS? AND THE POINT WAS WILL COMING AFTER THE DATE THAT THEY WOULD DO TO BE -- ALL THEIR DAY TO GET THE LICENSE AND I KNOW THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION THAT WE WERE THINKING OF DOING. EIGHT EIGHT THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS [inaudible] DELAY. FOR SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT IS THAT HAPPENING OR NOT I I HEARD IT AS A DISCUSSION I HAVEN'T SEEN IT AS A PLAN. OF MAY BECAUSE AFFECTS ME PERSONALLY JUST GOT MY RENEWAL AND TRY TO GET APPOINTMENTS AND IT'S OCCURRING A MONTH AFTER MY STUFF IS DO YOU. THAT SAID I DON'T ONE OF YOU FACE THE DMV BUT OBVIOUSLY I MIGHT BECOME SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WE HAVE. MADE AN EFFORT TO TRY TO CORRECT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE CREATED OR THAT WERE CREATED AS A RESULT OF THE OF OF WHAT'S GOING ON HAVE WE DONE THAT. YES AND SO ON I THINK THAT -- THE DISCUSSION YOU REFERENCE SCENE HAD TO DO FIRST OF ALL WITH WITH BILLING AND SO -- THAT ARE MOTOR VEHICLES NORMALLY SENDS OUT BILLS -- AND AND LIKE YOUR RENEWAL NOTICE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD GO OUT NINETY DAYS BEFORE IT'S DUE -- AND STICK DEBT WITH THE TO GIV YOU TIME. TO RESPOND AND AND A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT THAT IS BEING -- CHANGE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS SO THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF EXTENDING THAT OUT SO EVERYBODY WILL GET THEIR RENEWAL NOTICES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE. WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE ENOUGH TIME THERE FOR CUSHION FOR OF THOSE APPOINTMENTS. BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OF THESE NOTICES AND NOT GO OUT NINETY DAYS IN ADVANCE THE ONE THAT I RECEIVED. SO AS A RESULT IS MORE LIKE FORTY FIVE DAYS SO YOU APPLY -- FOR TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AND ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE APPOINTMENT WILL COME. UP THIRTY OF FORTY DAYS AFTER IT SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SO YOU LICENSE WILL EXPIRE AND OF THE WORDS BEFORE YOU HAVE RENEWAL SO YOU HAVE THE CHOICE. OF EITHER GOING AND STANDING IN LINE FOR EVER AND TRYING TO GET IT DONE. OR HAVING AN EXPIRED LICENSE WHICH ALWAYS CREATED MORE PROBLEMS SO I KNOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT. THAT THE NOTICES HAD GONE OUT. NINETY AND SO WHEN PEOPLE THEN WENT ON THE LINE TO TRY TO GET AN APPOINTMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GREEN OF THEIR LICENSE. THAT THEY WOULD BE BASICALLY WHAT THE DATE PASSED THE DEPRESSED THE EXPIRATION DATE SO THE QUESTION IS AND I KNOW WAS SOME DISCUSSION THAT WE WERE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT. AND TRY TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A SITUATION FOLKS IN NOW VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY TRYING TO GET A DATE AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING. AND GOT AND SO THEY'RE GOT THESE RENEWAL DATES BEYOND THE EXPIRATION DATE -- AND AND THERE WAS A NINETY DAYS THAT THAT INPUTS THEY RECEIVE THEIR WE KNOW LICENSE AND AND BILLING. SO HAVE WE GRAPPLE WITH THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IT BUT I GUESS IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AFTER THE LAST HEARING. WELL IN TERMS OF DMV'S PROCESS IS THERE IN THE PROCESS OF OF SWITCHING OVER TO THE I DON'T EXACTLY WHAT DAY IT PAID DINNER WILL HAPPEN THERE SWITCHING OVER -- TO SENDING OUT. FOR OUR RENEWAL NOTICES ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS IN ADVANCE. RIGHT BUT YOU GOT SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED NOTICES THAT WERE NOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NOR NINETY DAYS IN ADVANCE. AND THEY ARE NOW IN A SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE THE ONSLAUGHT OF FOLKS TRYING TO GET IN THERE THAT THEY ARE THERE'S LICENSE WILL EXPIRE. BEFORE THEY CAN GET AN APPOINTMENT. AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE WOULD ALWAYS. AS THE OTHER IS THAT SOMEONE ASKED ABOUT THAT NICK WAS IT HAPPEN TO ME IS I'M IN THE SAME SITUATION -- SOUL OR IS OUR ONLY SOLUTION TO GO STAND IN LINE. BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CALL DMB YOU GET A RECORDING SO IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN -- SO YOU'RE CONSTANTLY COMPUTER PUSHING A BUTTON THAT GIVES YOU DATES AND EVEN FURTHER THAN THE FIRST DAY. SO. WHAT'S THE SOLUTION TO THE PRODUCT I DO KNOW WE WHEN WE AND THE SOMEONE IT SAID THEY WERE THINKING OF DOING EXTENSION. FOR THOSE THAT ARE BETTER BEEN CAUGHT IN THIS RIGHT NOW BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON THAT. WELL I KNOW THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING THAT AND A PROCESS FOR AS EXTENSIONS I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW I COULD FOLLOW UP. OKAY WHO WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION. DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES. LET ME ANSWER THE PHONE. OKAY SOUND LIKE A PLAN THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS MATHIS [inaudible] SO. SO SOME UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY YOU GUYS PRIDE YOURSELVES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE. RIGHT IT'S E. YOU YOU HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS AND TIMES AND WAIT TIMES CORRECT -- FINE AS THE DATE DVDS. TRYING TO GO AND SAY OKAY WE WE WANT TO DO FIFTEEN MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE MINUTE. IN THIS IS THE STANDARD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. BUT DE FIND A REMARKABLE THAT WERE CALLING. IT THEY WERE CALLING OUR OUR FOLKS CUSTOMERS BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THEY CAN'T TAKE THEIR BUSINESS SOMEWHERE ELSE. WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE TIME IT IS A RESTAURANT. WAS MULTIPLE HOURS PEOPLE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. WITH DMV THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE. AND SO IT'S IS JUST PREPOSTEROUS TO ME THAT THEY WERE CALLING ON CUSTOMERS WHEN IT WHEN THEY'RE MORE TRAFFIC MEAN. NORMAL CELLS LIKE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID HOTEL CALIFORNIA YOU CHECK IN BEACON NEVER LEAVE. AND IN THIS IS GETTING A FIX. SO WITH AS THESE MATRICES ARE DONE AND AS WE COME BACK TO THESE HEARINGS. I DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE SOMETHING THERE I WANT TO SEE SOMETHING. IN THE MANAGEMENT. IN IN WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE AT THE MANAGER LEVELS IN THE SUPERVISOR LEVELS BECAUSE WHEN WE GET THE PHONE CALLS AND WE WE HEAR ABOUT THE STORIES OF YOU KNOW EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE BEEN SLEEPING HALF. THE TIME THEY'VE BEEN ON THE JOB. IT IT REALLY MAKES YOU ASK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE MANAGERS. AND THE SUPERVISORS WERE THESE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DOING. TO ENSURE. THAT THESE WAIT TIMES ARE HAPPENING [inaudible] THIS WAY. IN THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING CHANGED WITHIN THAT. EXPRESSION WHEN HE HOOKED HIS ARE ASKING FOR BLANK CHECKS. THIS COOPER MISTER COOPER OKAY [inaudible] ANY OTHER [inaudible] QUESTIONS. OKAY CAN WE GET OUT A MOTION A SECOND TO APPROVE S. B.. AS AMENDMENT IT -- IT SIX TWO AS AMENDED. YES MISTER COOPER. IT WHAT WILL MY CONCERN IS IS ON ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY WITH THE BILL REFORM SO. IT'S KIND IN THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE OVER. ALLOCATING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PROGRAM THE DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S REALLY MY BIG ISSUE WITH THAT. SO S. B. TEN IS AN APPROPRIATION SOMEWHERE LAST YEAR A. B. FORTY TWO WHICH THIS OPINION BILL. DIED. IN THE ASSEMBLY SO. WYRICK ALLOCATING MONEY FOR PROGRAM. THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN MAY NOT EXIST. NUMBER ONE IN THE NUMBER TO THE ONGOING NEARLY KOSTER TUNER MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] AND OBVIOUSLY. YOU GOT A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WERE ORIGINAL SPONSORS AND PULLED OFF THE BILL NOW POSE THE BILL ALSO. WHY ARE WE PUTTING DOWN THIS ROAD? JOSH DUGGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S ONGOING DISCUSSIONS REGARDING BAIL REFORM AND THIS ESTIMATE THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL -- IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT UPON THOSE -- DISCUSSIONS -- IF A BILL DID PASS WE KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME FORM OF START UP COSTS AND WE THINK AT THIS POINT THIS IS A A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE START UP COST. HOW OFTEN DO YOU DO THAT FOR SIMILAR BILLS AND JUST? NOT EVEN BILL BILLS BUT DO WE DO THIS I MEAN THAT'S THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL CORRECT I SORRY I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO HOW OFTEN WE HAVE DONE ASSEMBLY SENATOR YOUR TIME WHICH YOU'VE BEEN IN THE OFFICE. I AM NOT SURE I COULD SPEAK TO THAT AND I APOLOGIZE OFF THE TOP MY HEAD WHETHER OR NOT. WE DON'T FEEL RECALL OUR I MEAN AND THAT'S THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS NOW I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL MAYBE I'M WRONG THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS SEE WORKING AT OFFICE THAT YOU DO OF NUMBER OF BUDGET BILLS. SO IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. IN HELL YOU BEEN THERE. FOR I'VE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT FIVE AND HALF YEARS. SO IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS HAVE YOU SEEN THIS DONE FOR ANY OTHER BILL. TO THE BEST YOUR RECOLLECTION. TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION ON MY ASSIGNMENT AREA I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT BUT THAT'S A SMALL PORTION OF THE OVERALL STATE. BUDGET. SO I TAKE THAT AS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT ARE. THAT'S CORRECT I AND I'M NOT AWARE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS DONE IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET. WHO HAVE BIG ISSUES WITH WITH PATROL REFORM INCLUDING THE OPEN PROTOCOLS RULES OF COURT TRAINING ADMINISTRATOR? MYSTERY OF ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND ONE THING WHAT I TALK ABOUT THIS -- AD NAUSEAM IS. IN IN CALIFORNIA JUDGES SET THE BILL SO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN EVERY TWO YEARS A PANEL OF JUDGES IN THOSE COUNTY SET THE BILL. SO BILL. IN THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN ONE COUNTY FOR THE CHARGER RODRIGUEZ TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT WAS ALWAYS A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANOTHER COUNTY AND ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN SO. THAT AS A BIG ISSUE EVEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE SPOKE ABOUT IT. TO US AND FURTHERMORE IN A LOT OF FOLKS JUST DON'T SHOW UP THE FIELD TO APPEAR AND THAT'S REALLY A BIG ISSUE. WITH FOLKS NOT SHOWING UP YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE DENNIS OFFICE TO GIVE YOUR CARD HEY HERE'S YOUR DATE YOUR PLAY A SHOW UP. AWFUL STILL SHOW FOR COURT AS WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUSTING WARRANTS IN THE MILLIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO IT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST PUZZLING AT ITS HEAD SCRATCHING. KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THIS BETTING ON THE COM IT MAY NOT HAPPEN NOVICE LAST YEAR WITH THE I SAID EARLIER WITH AB FORTY TWO IT DID NOT HAPPEN. SO HERE WE ARE PUTTING MONEY. FOR AND THERE'S WE NEED MONEY ELSEWHERE LA PROGRAMS ARE VERY WORTHY THAT WE CAN BE A SETTING MONEY ASIDE. IF IT DID PASS THEM FOR THEIR OTHER BILLS IN THIS PACKAGE. THAT MAY PATH THAT NO HEAVY. DOES DE ARE DESIGNED OR DO WHATEVER FUNDING STREAM DOES NEED A FUNDING STREAM SO. I GUESS SAID THIS IS THIS IS B. S.. FLOOD LBS WHAT IS IN HERE. AND IT IS TO A CERTAIN WITH THE SYSTEM THE BILL IT'S IS POLICY WILL COME TO ASSEMBLY FOR WILL HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IN THE NEXT TWELVE DAYS. BUT BUT TO HAVE THIS BILL HERE I MEAN. TO AND YOU WONDER WHY WE WONDER WHY WHEN THE PROBLEMS WE ARE OR TRY TO FIX IT HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THIS. AND THAT'S WHY ON THE FLOOR WILL HAVE DISCUSSION DISCUSS IT BUT BUT THE MONEY HERE. I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS. BUT ALL PERIOD. AND AND IT IS THIS IS REALLY RESUME THE WRONG WAY TO HELP MY COLLEAGUES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS IS NOT HOW YOU DO BUSINESS. THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW YOU DID YOU HAVE LIVELY DEBATE ABOUT ISSUES. AND ALSO THE MONEY ASIDE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MONEY. THE BILL DOESN'T PASS. WHAT HAPPENS THAT DISNEY MONEY CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME? YES THEIR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE INCLUDING THE BUDGET -- ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE EXPENDITURE PENDING THE PASSAGE OF PRE TRIAL REFORM LEGISLATION SO THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE. YEAH LEVEL FOR THIS [inaudible] MISS MATH [inaudible] SO THAT I DID TO MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION SO SO AMERICAN NATION AND AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A YES OR NO OUT OF YOU. ON ON TO IF YOU SEEN THIS BEFORE. YOU SAID IN IN YOUR FIVE AND A HALF YEARS YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN YOUR BUDGET. AREA IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T RECALL SEEING IT IN MY BUDGET AREA HIGH. IT MEDICALLY CANNOT SPEAK TO OVER THE FIVE AND A HALF YEARS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY HAS HAPPENED IN MY HEART BUDGET SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA. MAKE A MOVE. TO CHANGE. TO TO TAKE TAX DOLLARS TO PUT IN A SYSTEM FOR BELL. THAT HASN'T PASSED THE LEGISLATURE YET. JUST TO HAVE IT THERE JUST IN CASE. AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS. SO TO CLARIFY -- I'M NOT SURE THAT THE CLARIFICATION WILL ALLEVIATE ALL OF YOUR CONCERN BUT THIS IS A NOT A GENERAL APPROPRIATION THIS IS FROM THE TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND AND THERE WAS A AT THIS POINT NO -- INCREASE TO THE REVENUE IN THE TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND ALTHOUGH THE PROVISION DOES INDICATE WHAT THAT -- THERE WOULD BE AN INTENT TO PROVIDE ENERAL FUND IN THE FUTURE YEAR IF -- THEM IF THE EXPENDITURE OCCURS AND THE PASSAGE OF PRE TRIAL FORM LEGISLATION OCCURS WOULD THINK IN ENDING MOST MY CONSTITUENTS WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD PUT. PASSED THE LEGISLATION AND THEN AFTER WE PASS IT IN IT GOES IN THE LONG. AND AFTER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT AND THEN AS WE COME BACK OUT OF NEXT YEAR [inaudible] IF. THE THIS BILL REFORM WAS TO PASS. AND AND I SAY THAT IS A BIG IF THEN. WE WOULD LOOK AT IT IN THE BUDGET THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO SO WHY WOULD WE DO IT. I MEAN YEAH I HONESTLY AB A VIEW YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ANYWHERE ELSE. SO WHY WOULD WE BE DOING IT HERE. I THINK THE THE ISSUE IS THAT -- IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT IF THE LEGISLATION DOES PASS THERE WOULD BE REASONABLE START UP COSTS IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR SO THAT YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LEGISLATOR OUGHT TO DO ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ON A WHAT IF BASIS. I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD SPEAK. TO HOW THE A BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SHOW. YOU THAT THIS IS A WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS. IN IN IF WE'RE STARTING TO LEGISLATE BASED ON WHAT IF AND COMMIT STATE BUDGETS TO WHAT IF. IS IS THIS OF ANY IN THIS ISN'T A STANDARD PRACTICE. SO IT IS IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS SOMEBODY FROM THE PART IN A FINANCES IS HOW WE SHOULD BE OPERATING. ARE ON A WHAT IF BASIS. MY RECOMMENDATION ON THE AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT THIS IS A A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION -- THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN START UP COSTS IF LEGISLATION PASS AND THE WAY THAT THE LANGUAGES WRITTEN I THINK THAT IT PROTECTS AGAINST ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURES IN THE INTENT THAT LEGISLATION DOES NOT PASS NO I THINK. RUNNING A WHAT IF BUDGET IS NOT US MORROW FOR THE STATE MISS MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I I THINK EVERYBODY'S FIGURED OUT THAT THERE'S SOME GREAT FRUSTRATION WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- AND I WILL AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER COOPER THAT IT IS UNUSUAL. THAT WE WOULD PUT THAT MONEY IN PRIOR TO THE BILL BEING APPROVED I DON'T KNOW THAT WE DONE THAT BEFORE I'M SO IT IT DOES. SORT OF HINT AT PERHAPS THERE BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT THE REST OF US HAVE NOT BEEN PRIVY TO THAT'S REALLY NOT. YOUR AREA TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND I JUST. WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT -- YOU KNOW THE FOLKS WHO COME UP WITH THESE BILLS AND WORKERS IN IT. DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO THE DMV AND SETTING THAT AMOUNT [inaudible] NOW RIGHT. YOU JUST RUN THE NUMBERS IS THAT CORRECT. I THINK AS THE OTHER GENTLEMAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF DMT. SO BUT HE WAS ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT ABOUT [inaudible] DMV. RIGHT NOW HE THAT THIS DRAMA WAS GOING TARGET. BOTH AREAS OKAY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. WHO DID YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION? I THOUGHT FOR SURE HE WAS ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FINDINGS. WE'RE JUST TO UNVEIL REFORM WITH HIM. I'M CIRCUITRY BE THE QUESTION I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHO IS. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NUMBERS THAT ARE PLACED IN THESE BUDGET TRAILER BILLS DID DID YOU. COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS WERE YOU. DIRECTED TO PUT I MEAN BECAUSE I JUST. I'M TRYING TO HELP ME OUT HERE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MISPLACED FRUSTRATION IN WHAT'S IN THIS BILL. WELL I CAN -- I MEAN THE PART OF FINANCE WORKS WITH DEPARTMENTS AND AND IN COMING UP WITH NUMBERS -- BROADLY -- AT I UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION AS WELL. THE DMP COMPONENT IS THAT SO TERMS OF THOSE NUMBERS THAT WE WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND TO COME UP WITH -- YEAH I IDENTIFY WORKLOAD AND THEY YOU KNOW THAT'S A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH WITH US. SAY YOU HELPED IN CRAFTING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR THE DMV. WHO WELCOMES THIS A LICK THE CURRENT PROVISIONS DON'T ACTUALLY -- ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR THAT IN TERMS OF THAT. THE FUNDING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED THAT'S ALREADY CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET. YES WE WORKED WITH THE MV TO GO THROUGH THEIR WORKLOAD ASSUMPTIONS AND AND STAFFING ASSUMPTIONS. OKAY LET ME REPHRASE THIS. BECAUSE NOW I'M FRUSTRATED. REMOVING THE LIMITATION. IT WAS TWENTY SIX MILLION. THAT LIMITATION HAS NOW BEEN REMIT. DID THAT COME FROM YOU OR YOUR PARTICULAR PART OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS A PART OF YOUR DECISION TO DECIDE THAT THERE THIS GUY SHOULD BE THE LIMIT. YOU KNOW. TV WHEN. SO SO I PERSONALLY DID NOT. WHAT WAS THAT PART OF THAT PARTICULAR DISCUSSION THAT YIELDED THAT RESULTS? I KNOW THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS. THAT -- SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH PERHAPS. A PERSON OR TWO LET LET ME ANSWER THE QUESTION. WHILE KNOW ACTUALLY I MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I WOULD HEAR FROM HIM SURE. SO NOT YOU BUT SOMEBODY YOU WORK WITH SOMEBODY IN YOUR OFFICE SOMEONE IN THEIR HELPS TO COME UP WITH THIS [inaudible] NUMBER. INTERNET HELP OTHER THE DEPARTMENT AND IT TERMS OF THE TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL IN TERMS OF GETTING RID OF THE LIMITS. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OCCURRED IN. IN THE CONTEXT OF OF MEETINGS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. AND THAT CHAIRS OFFICE AND OTHERS. I RECEIVED THE IT'S A RECEIVE THE UPDATED LANGUAGE YESTERDAY. THAT WAS YOU KNOW THEY CAME OUT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] TO COOPER. IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT REDUCING COST A LAW DOESN'T EXIST YET -- SO YOUR ESTIMATING THAT FOR THE ONGOING COST WILL BE TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR CORRECT YEAH. CORRECT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF PRIO TRIAL REFORM LEGISLATION COULD -- COSTS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BECAUSE I I'VE BEEN TOLD BY INDIVIDUALS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT. WITH ALL THE PARTS THAT GO INTO THAT [inaudible] SO. BUT WOULD WOULD COME UP WITH THE WITH THE FIFTEEN MILLION. ONE I THINK THAT. THE SIGNIFICANT MAGNITUDE OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS ALSO. AN INDICATION OF WHY WE THINK THAT IT'S PRUDENT TO SET ASIDE TO RESEMBLE -- START UP COSTS. FOR A OF POTENTIAL CHANGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION. NOTHING I JUST MIGHT MY STATEMENT IS AYE AYE SILICON VALLEY'S IF IF IF MISS LYDIA COMMITTEE. ON THIS BLOWS MY PERSONAL FEELINGS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER BILL. UGH JUST TO COMMENT ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF BAIL REFORM THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY UNIQUE SITUATION AND IT IN IN MY VIEW AND NOT ONLY -- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH IT CERTAINLY MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE BUDGET AND I JUST HAVEN'T. HAD NOTICEDIT BEFORE A A A CONTINGENT -- TO AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT AYE IN IN THIS CASE -- THIS IS A PRIORITY OF THAT CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. OF IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE GOVERNOR AND THAT'S PRIORITY OF BOTH OF THE LEADERS OF OTHER -- OF THAT HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE -- AND SO I THINK THAT TO HAVE -- PUTS US IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT -- CATEGORY WE RARELY SEE ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT PUSHING -- FOR REFORM -- IN THE WAY. IF IT'S A CHIU PRIORITY OR TALK ABOUT WITH TWELVE DAYS LEFT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY [inaudible] THIS. BODY THEY SIMPLY. THE BILL WAS KILLED LAST YEAR DID NOT PASS TO DO NOT GET ENOUGH VOTES ON THAT SO. ASSIST BEEN GOING O FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT OUR CAUCUS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. IN THE CHIEF JUST THINKING OLIVE SOME ISSUES I BOUGHT UP THAT IT NEVER BEEN ADDRESSED BY ANYBODY AT ALL. SO IRAN IT'S COUNTY JAIL. FOR TWO YEARS. I SO I'M ACT AND BE HAPPY TO RESPOND THAT MUCH OF THE CHAIR WILL JUST TO GET A JOB AS COLLOQUY NUMBERS TO CALL I MISS MAKING COMMENTS BUT SO I I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND LAW THESE ISSUES IT'S IT'S IT'S A THIS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO IT. WE ALL WANT IT FIXED WILL WANT CHANGES BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS. AND UP TILL NOW THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED AND THAT'S THE REASON SO. SO JUST TO CLARIFY IF YOU ARE WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED THAT PLEASE WAIT FOR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT SOME MISTER BLOOM AYE COMMUTERS. DAN AT AS MY COLLEAGUE COULD -- HIMSELF JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BILL HAS A IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER -- BEEN A PRIORITY FOR AT LEAST TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS NOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THIS ISSUE -- HOT ALBEIT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS DISAGREEMENT OVER -- OVER THE ISSUE [inaudible] BOOKS. I THINK IT'S MCCARTY THANK YOU GET JUST SOME CLARIFYING POINTS ON THIS FOR THE FOR THE BIG PICTURE I SUPPORT THEY'LL REFORM AND THERE'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE QUITE SAFE THERE BUT FOR THEM PRETRIAL. WHAT'S THAT CLARIFICATION PRE TRIAL REFORM. I AM DOWN JUST A NOTE THAT. THIS IS A DEBATE ON THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT JULY ONE SO IF THIS PASSES WERE. THREE MAYBE FOUR YEARS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SO IF THAT IF THE REFORM PASSES IN THE FALL. BE SIGNED INTO LAW IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE OUT YEARS AND SO. THAT THERE IS THE PROJECTED AS YOU SET UP TO TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IS REALLY AN OUT YEAR BUDGET DISCUSSION THIS JUST PROVIDES. PROP PRUDENT COSTS BUT IN THE BUDGET ARE PRETTY RESOURCE IN THE BUDGET TO ADDRESS COST FOR THE FINAL THREE OR FOUR MONTHS IF THAT MEASURE GETS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND IF IT DOESN'T. THERE IS A CATCH IS TO GO BACK TO ESSENTIALLY ARE RESERVE SO I THINK THAT -- IT'S NOT IRRESPONSIBLE AND IT SETS UP IN A WAY THAT -- MAKE SURE OF THIS MEASURE IS DOT PASSED BY THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S YEAR THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITY TO DO IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE FINAL THREE YEARS FINAL THREE MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT I DON'T. MISTER FEAR HOLD ON TWITTER. WE GOT PEOPLE CONNECT. I MISTER RESEARCH.

AND ARE YOU CAN READ REPEAT THE QUESTION THE OTHER THEIR THEIR ELDERS TODAY THERE THE BILL'S WILL BE VOTING ON IN THIS BUDGET THAT HAVE POTENTIAL COST. IS THAT TRUE. I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD SPEAK TO ALL THE THE BILLS BUT I THINK THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE BILLS THAT WOULD BE VOTED ON INCLUDE THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL'S. JUDGE I DON'T JUST OCCUR FROM THIS COOPER QUESTIONS NOT TOTALLY. NAM. IT DOESN'T HER WHERE WE DO. APPROPRIATE MONEY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS FOUR CONTINGENT ACTION.

WHERE WE DO ON [inaudible] APPROPRIATE. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN ACTION TAKEN. DURING THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR CREEK UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS.

YES CHRIS FERGUSON WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WOULD BE COMPRISED OF TWELVE MEMBERS UP FOR FROM THE RAP FOR APPOINTED BY THE ASSEMBLY FOR APPOINTED BY THE SENATE AND FOUR BY THE ADMINISTRATION THE COMMITTEE WHAT SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT A CERTAIN ACTION OR CERTAIN COMPONENTS ON IN. PARTICULAR WOULD BE LOOKING AT UP FIRST GENERATION METRICS IT WOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE DEFINE LOW INCOME STATUS FOR PURPOSES FORMULA. IT WOULD BE LOOKING AT OVER SESSION SCENARIO AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THE INCORPORATION OF A DOT. NONCREDIT A DIVE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENT SO THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD SOME WORK BEFORE IT.

FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IN I DESERVED MY COLLEAGUES TO DO AS WE GO FORWARD WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS A BODY BECAUSE WHY HAVE US WHY HAVE A COMMITTEE PROCESS. WHY HAVE POLICY COMMITTEES OF WE'RE JUST GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN THE BUDGET -- SO THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING OUR BODY NEEDS TO TALK ABOUT -- WITH REGARD -- TO THE L. CAPPIES I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT WERE STRENGTHENING THE EL CAP DAY BE. GIVEN MORE DEFINITION. TWO THE ALL CAPS HAVING THEM POSTED ON WEBSITES IS GOOD. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD A COUNTY OFFICE HAVE TO POSTED IN EL CAP WHY WOULD A SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE TO POST IN NOW EL CAP ON THEIR WEBSITE WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING. AND WHY WOULD NOT A CHARTER. SPECIFICALLY LEAVES OUT CHARTERS AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PUTTING THE MEN AND I LIKE TO KNOW WHY THEY ARE INCLUDING. THIS IS GONNA COME BACK. THIS IS SEVEN BEEN NAVY BUT IT'S STRENGTHENS A CHARTER FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THE GOALS AND MISSION ARE. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME ON JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UNDERLING WHICH THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU THAT REQUIRES IT TO BE ON THE HOME PAGE -- AND PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO AND CHAOS EDUCATION ARE YOU REQUIRED TO MAKE THEIR HOW CAPS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AND THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY THE QUITE THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS SO THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE SEEING IS TO STRENGTHEN THE LANGUAGE THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CHAOS IS OF EDUCATION GREG THAT WAS MY QUESTION THE QUESTION IS WHY ARE CHARTERS INCLUDING. SO. WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU AND THAT WASN'T PART OF OUR DISCUSSION WE WERE. HAVING A WHAT MIGHT ASSUME IT WAS PART OF THE DISCUSSION SO WHY WERE THEY SO THE THE DISCUSSION WHAT THAT WE HAD WAS ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE.

MR CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS BILL LUCY WITH THAT VOICE -- WANTED TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO A FEW ISSUES ONE WAS ON THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY LANGUAGE. DEALING WITH AL CAPP TEMPLATES WHERE I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU APPRECIATIVE TO THE CHAIR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR DR WEBER ALSO FOR THE WORKING THE STAFF IN MOVING THE NEEDLE. ON INCREASING APPROVED SERVICES AND MORE TRANSPARENCY WE WE DO BELIEVE THERE IS MORE TO GO BUT THIS. THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE AND IT NEEDS TO KEEP GOING FORWARD AND NOT THINK THAT WE'VE HIT THE PINNACLE OF SUCCESS IN. TRANSPARENCY INCLUDING INFORMATION FOR PARENTS UP TO BEING ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN HELPING TO TARGET RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED MOST FOR THE AND DEPARTED STUDENTS. UP HAVING SAID THAT WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSIDER FORMAL WORK GROUP FITS IN STATUTE THE REPORTS AINLEY BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY COUNTY BILLY TO THIS BODY IN YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO ENSURE THAT TRANSPARENCY IN STRENGTHENING TRANSPARENCY ACTUALLY IS A COMMITMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS. THIS IS PROBABLY LESS THAN HALF A CUP BUT WORTH DOING. AND COMMENTING ON OTHER PROPOSALS ARE THERE IN THIS THEY WERE JUST DESCRIBED IS AMENDMENTS I'D HAVE TO SAY I JUST FOR THE RECORD I'VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE TWENTY NINE YEARS STARTING OUT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING LETTER DELEO. NEVER ONCE IN A FISCAL THE THE ISSUE OF TAKING OVER A WHOLE DIFFERENT APPROACH TO FISCAL DISTRESS BEEN HANDLED IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE IN THIS KIND OF A PROCESS WITH LITTLE PUBLIC INPUT -- I GUARANTEE YOU YOU CAN'T FIND A SINGLE PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN TWENTY NINE YEARS THAT YOU'VE EVER DONE THIS NEEDS MORE TRANSPARENCY EITHER IN THE FISCAL POLICY DISCUSSION OF A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. OR IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE ITSELF THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRIAN REAVIS ON BEHALF OF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST WE FEEL SIMILAR LEAD TO MR LUCIER AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM AT VOICE -- WE URGE YOU TO AN ACT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY BUT WE WOULD ASK OR WE WOULD URGE CAUTION AND WE ASK THAT YOU NOT CONSIDER THIS -- KEYS CLOSE AND THINK THAT WE ADDRESS ALL OF THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES THIS IS GOOD WORK A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO AROUND IDENTIFYING HOW MUCH THE STATE IS SPENDING. TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE SERVICES FRONT DUPLICATED STUDENTS AND ALSO DOCTOR WEBER IS BEEN OF MARBLES CHAMPION AROUND THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL SITE TRANSPARENCY WE THINK THAT'S ANOTHER AREA. THAT NEEDS SOME MORE WORK SO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK AND WE URGE APPROVAL BUT WE WE DO NEED SOME KIND OF ON GOING PROCESS TO CONTINUE IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY. SOME ARE WITH THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING PLACES THAT STATION WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FOR CAMINO COLLEGE FOR CLASSIFYING EMPLOYEE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND FOR THE EXTENSION TO RETROFIT SCHOOL BUSES -- WHICH OUT SAFETY OTHER SYSTEM WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. JERRY MEMBERS BRAD STRONG SENIOR DIRECTOR EDUCATION AT CHILDREN NOW I'M ACTIONS THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ACTIONS -- AND SERVICES SUMMARY CHART THE INCREASED IMPROVE SUMMARY CHARTS AND WE THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT AND AND GOOD STEPS FORWARD AS WELL AS THE THE ACCESSIBILITY ONLINE -- WE USE COULD STILL HAVE A SINCE THE OF THE EQUITY COALITION SUBMITTED A LETTER WITH OVER TWENTY SIGNATURES OF ORGANIZATIONS. AND THAT WE HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER INCLUDING BEFORE ADOPTION MEDICINALLY WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE THE REPORTING OF ACTUAL EXPENDITURES FOR EACH LEN EACH SCHOOL IS REQUIRED BY THE EVERY STUDENTS SUCCEED ACT IS NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS CONVERSATION. I'M CHILDREN NOW AND I AND I KNOW OTHERS HAVE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR AND THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES WITHIN A SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT IF THAT INFORMATION IS NOT ACCESSIBLE EVEN IF IT IS COLLECTED IN REPORTED SOMEWHERE THAT IT'S NOT USEFUL. OF FEDERAL LAW NO LONGER PROVIDES FOR THE PROTECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT. THROUGH THE ONEROUS ACCOUNTING OF EXPENDITURES IN ROOM AND THAT RESTRICT THE USE OF FUNDS INSTEAD RATHER. THAN ACCOUNTING FOR HOW THE FOR THEIR SPENDING FUNDS DISTRICTS WILL NOW FOCUS ON HOW THE ALLOCATE. STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES -- ACCORDING TO EVERY STUDENTS AND IT IS S. AS A REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES. CAN -- MORE CLOSELY MONITOR THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES TO THE VARIOUS SCHOOL SITES WITHIN THE DISTRICT. AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT MONITORING WILL BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA TO INSURE THAT SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS ART BEING SHORT CHANGED WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. HOW A CALIFORNIA ENSURE ACCESS TO THE SUB SITE LEVEL EXPENDITURES IN A MANNER THAT ENABLES MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT AND LOCAL SPENDING DECISIONS? DOCTOR WEBER WEBER AUTHORED AB TOUGH THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION BUT IT WAS DEEMED PREMATURE. THIS YEAR THE EQUITY COALITION ELEVATED IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE BEEN ADVISED IT ISN'T WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THIS WORKGROUP. AND YET THE QUESTION OF USEFUL ACCESS TO THIS DATA IS STILL UNRESOLVED WE HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE TECHNICAL OCEAN LETTERS. AND RECOMMENDATIONS WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ACTUAL EXPENDITURES FOR REPORTING FOR EACH LEN EACH SCHOOL SITE AND DO GREATLY APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE'S WORK. AND THE WORK GROUP ITSELF THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON TARA LOIS EXECUTOR ACTOR OF TEACH PLUS AND I ONE ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE LCF EQUITY COALITION THANK YOU.

TOOK TO ADDRESS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON IN THAT LETTER AND THINK ABOUT THAT THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD -- WE WOULD ALSO REITERATE THE RECOMMENDATION OF EXPRESS MY ADVICE FOR FOR STATUTORILY REQUIRED A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE -- BUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS BILLION REFLECTING THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF ALL LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS FAMILIES STUDENTS EDUCATORS IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT THIS TOOL IS IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER. AND BETTER INTEGRATED INTO ALL OF OUR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENTS UMP. GOOD AFTERNOON US WHISKEY AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES -- WE SUPPORT THE BILL ARE AS IT RELATES TO THE EL CAP TEMPLATE IMPROVEMENTS -- BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS -- BUT A SOME OF MY OUR ALLIES IN THE EQUITY COALITION HAVE SAID THIS DOES NOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE YOU HAVE BEEN OF SEEKING FOR YEARS. OR OR OR THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEKING FOR YEARS. PACIFIC WAY HOW MUCH THE STATE IS PROVIDING TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE SERVICES FOR ON DUPLICATED STUDENTS AND HOW MUCH OF LCF OF FUNDING IS BEING USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SCHOOL SITES -- WE AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE -- SOME STAKEHOLDER PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. OF AND FOR FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PARENTS AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN FAITHFULLY ENDING GOOD FAITH WORKING. TO MAKE THE EL CAP PROCESS WORK THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY CHALLENGING FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THEIR DISTRICTS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT THAN WHAT. THIS BASELINE LANGUAGE REQUIRES SO WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT USING TERMS LIKE AT A MINIMUM. OR SO THAT DISTRICTS DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO PULL BACK I ALSO WANT -- TO JOINED OF THE COMMENTS OF OF OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WITH REGARD TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING FORMULA.

COMMENTS MADE THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE RIGHT VOICE FROM THIS I TRUST WEST AND FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES WE SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD. AYE AND WE APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS IBM MADE WITH REGARDS TO FISCAL TRANSPARENCY BUT BELIEVE THAT THERE STILL ADDITIONAL WORK NEEDED. TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR OUR A DUPLICATED PUPILS AND WHERE THAT INVESTMENT HAS INDEED HELP NARROW THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. ADDITIONALLY I DO SUPPORT THE CONSIDERATION OF THE WORK GROUP TO BE ABLE TO A LOOK AT THESE ISSUES FURTHER. BUT IN ADDITION A FIRE APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF FIVE TWO OH SIX FOUR HE THAT'S IN THE BILL. WHICH REQUIRES THAT THERE BE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS MADE BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO THE ELEAZAR WITH REGARDS TO INCLUDING ACTIONS IN THEIR EL CAP SPECIFIC TO ENGLISH LEARNERS BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. IN THE PAST WHEN WE'VE REVIEWED. ALL OVER I DON'T KNOW TWENTY FOUR AL CAPS OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS THAT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY. THIS WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS. ARE THERE IS A CONCERN OF THE BILL IS PROPOSING TO REPEAL. A SECTION SIX OR EIGHT ONE ZERO OUR I JUST A LOOKED AT THAT TODAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR POSITION WOULD BE ON THAT SPECIFIC REPEAL BUT SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER BY THE END OF THE DAY TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SAYING NONE LIKE. TO DOCTOR WEBER. YES I AM I WANT TO THANK ALSO THE STAFF AND WHO WORK VERY HARD ON THIS ISSUE -- THEY'VE BEEN WORKING OVER THE BREAK AND ALL ALONG TO REALLY TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WOULD DOWN. IMPROVE OUR EL CAP AND AND CREATE SOME TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE ISSUE OF THE FUNDING AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE REALLY. GETTING THE MONEY TO THE KIDS WHO WE SAY WE WERE GOING TO GIVE IT TO FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WHETHER THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED THAT -- WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM ACTUALLY PRODUCING A DOCUMENT THAT MAKES SENSE TO PARENTS AND THAT WAS THE CHARGE AND MANY WAYS TELLING APPROVAL CAP. IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR PARENTS TO KNOW AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME DISCUSSION IN COMPARISON ABOUT WHERE MONEY IS GOING WITHIN THAT IS BEING PUT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHETHER NOT THAT THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TWEAKED IN AND AND AND AND CHAINS IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. SO WE'RE LONG WAY FROM THAT AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO WORK BECAUSE SOME OF YOU HAVE PUT IN. SOME LONG HOURS FOR THE LAST. FIVE WHEN WE WERE SURE THAT THERE WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY WITH EL CAP WITH LC A FAST AND WE DIDN'T GET IT THEN AND WAS STILL STRUGGLING WITH THAT TODAY. AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO DELAY DELAY DELAY FOR FOUR YEARS NOW WE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO WE NEED TO CREATE SOME SENSE OF TRANSPARENCY AND WE STILL HAVE NOT. WAS SITTING AND I HAVE WORKED ON THIS FOR FIVE YEARS I THINK SINCE EL CARE SINCE WE DID LCF AB. AND IT CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING -- TO THOSE OF US AS I LOOK AT WHAT WE PRODUCED AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE BACK AND HANDED TO US SOME OF MY MOST ACTIVE PARENTS IN MY DISTRICT AND SAY. ARE WE DOING A GOOD JOB IS THIS MORE THE MONEY SHOULD BE GOING AYE WE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE KIDS OF MEAT AS WE SAID WE WOULD DO. A FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME INTO THIS HOUSE SO -- I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO WORK OF THESE ARE SOME REAL DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE WORKED. ALL ON THIS ISSUE FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AS WELL AS OUR STAFF -- WE WILL NOT GIVE UP. WE WILL FIGURE THIS OUT MOST OF YOU KNOW I IF LORD WILLING AND THE CREEK DON'T RISE I HAVE SIX MORE YEARS. AND AND WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS WE WILL FIGURE OUT WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND EVEN IF IT DOESN'T GO IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE HE IS. AND WHETHER NOT ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL AND HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE ARE MAKING A NOT MAKING ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- SO I I'M COMMITTED THIS I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO ALSO WORKED ON THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE KIDS WILL LEFT BEHIND. AND THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE IN THE TESTING FOR THAT TO ACCOMPLISH. OF WHAT WE NEED TO ACCOMPLISH BUT IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY AND I'M NOT PLEASE IN THEY'RE NOT PLEASE BUT WE KNOW WAS SLOWLY MAKING THESE BABY STEPS. BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET FAST AND WE'VE GOT TO GET BETTER BECAUSE EVERY DAY THAT WE DELAY AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHERE THE MONEY GOES WE HAVE CHILDREN'S LIVES WHO IN OUR HANDS. THAT NOT BEING ADEQUATELY SIR THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THE BILL. THANK YOU BYE MISTRUST. I GOTTA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THIS ALSO FOR SIX YEARS -- THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS IN HERE THAT DEAL WITH POLICY NOW LIKE TO REFER LIKE ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER. THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEST A BEEN THERE -- TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE MOB POLICY ISSUES. THAT BEING SAID [inaudible] THE TRANSPARENT SHE'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE LOOKED AT MAKE YOU DOUBT CAP A RELEVANT -- DEALING WITH THE DASHBOARD. PUT IT ONLINE -- BUT ONE OF THE MISTAKES I THINK WE MAKE [inaudible] SACRAMENTO. IN THE ASSEMBLY. IS THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE OWNERSHIP OF EVERYTHING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEM IF YOU LOOK AT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING AND HELP CAP IT WAS TO EMPOWER. THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'VE TAKEN A GREAT -- LOT OF TIME IN MY OWN DISTRICT TO LOOK AT HOW MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE DEALT WITH THIS AND AND TO SUMMER SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER [inaudible] SAME DEMOGRAPHICS -- ONE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH LOCAL OR DRAW FUNNY THAT HELLCAT BECAUSE THEY EMPOWERED THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY WOULDN'T OF THE CHURCHES IN THE COMMUNITY GROUPS. AND THE PGA IS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR PRODUCT. IN LOOK AT THE RESULTS GIVEN TO THOSE STUDENTS -- THE FIRST THREE GREAT FIRST SECOND THIRD YEAR OUTPERFORMING SOME OF THE HIGHEST PER. ACADEMICS BECAUSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT. RIGHT NEXT DOOR ANOTHER ONE IS FAILING. BUT THEY HAVE. AND THAT'S SCHOOL THEY'RE SICK OF MY OPINION THEY HAVE NOT ENGAGE A COMMUNITY THEY TOOK ON THE OWNERSHIP TO THEM SOLVE TO SCHOOL BOARD. AND THE ADMINISTRATORS BECAUSE THEY KNEW BASS AND DID NOT EMPOWER THE PARENTS. THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. YOU CAN DO FOR CHILD AND EDUCATION IS APPARENT. AND SECONDARY WITH THE TEACHER AND THAT'S WHERE THE EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES EMPOWER THEM. THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE NEED TO SEND DOWN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE NEED TO TALK TO OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. EIGHT THIS IS YOURS IF YOU WANT US TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO CATEGORICAL. AND WE KNOW THAT DIDN'T WORK SO. DON'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE BURDEN UPON OURSELVES UP HERE. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE TO DO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE YOU OPPORTUNITIES AND REDDING CALIFORNIA ARE DIFFERENT THE BAKERSFIELD AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT THAN IN CARLSBAD. BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS IN THE CULTURES OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. I BELIEVE A GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AS FAR AS LOCAL TROUGH FUNDING AL CAPP DASH BOARD. TRANSPARENCY OR ALL GREAT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT WAY. BUT DON'T PUT IT ON US THAT WE ARE THE DID THE FONT OF KNOWLEDGE OR NOT. GOVERNMENT IS BEST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE NEED TO TALK TO OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS ARE DUMB. TAKE OWNERSHIP BUT THERE'S A MAKE IT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. YOU DON'T WANT US INVOLVED IN THAT AND SOMETIMES I THINK WE WANT TO GET INVOLVED SAY. THIS IS PRESCRIPTIVE DO A. B. C. DAY [inaudible] THAT'S THAT'S A FAILURE BECAUSE ABC DAY AND WE'RE WRITING IS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS AND BIGGEST FAILURE CARLSBAD.

EIGHT SIX NINE REGARDING GENERAL GOVERNMENT IN ELECTIONS. WITH MR CALLUM. FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE PRESENTING PLEASE BEGIN. PUT COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SENATE BILL. EIGHT SIXTY NINE AS A GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL RELATED TO ELECTIONS THE BILL CLARIFIES HOW THE CALCULATION OF QUALIFIED ELECTORS IS COMPUTED. FOR AN AMENDMENT TO THE CHARTER -- OF THE SEA CAN'T COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND OTHER RELATED CHANGES ADDITIONALLY INCLUDES A FEDERAL TRUST FUND AUGMENTATION AND I WILL ALLOW THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO SEND. FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE COUNTIES TO IMPROVE AND SECURE ELECTION SYSTEMS. THANK YOU MISTER BLOCKED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO I WAS READING THE TITLE THE BILL SAYS COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. LOCAL ELECTIONS. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE BUDGET? SO THE BILL INCLUDES AN APPROPRIATION AND TO SEND MONEY TO COUNTIES TO IMPROVE THEIR ELECTION SYSTEMS AND I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY IN THE FRAMEWORK OF MAKING SURE ELECTIONS. HAPPEN THE WAY THAT THEIR INTENDED TO AND I THINK THIS IS RELATED TO PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SO. AND IT'S A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HIS SO THERE MIGHT BE COLLEAGUES I COULD HE HOPED [inaudible] ONE X. OKAY GOING I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S ONE LINE AT THE END OF CONTAINS A SMALL APPROPRIATION -- THE REST OF THE BILL I WOULD SAY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET AND SO THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF IS. WHY ARE WE CONSIDERING THIS BILL IN BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I HAVE -- A VERY -- UNFORTUNATE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND MY ANSWER IS THAT IT'S AN ATTEMPT BY. THE LEGISLATURE TO INTERFERE SORTS OF A LOCAL ELECTION. AND Y. WITH THE LEGISLATURE INTERFERE. WELL IT'S A PARTISAN FIGHT AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME LOOK IN THE PREAMBLE OF THIS BILL UNLESS THE COURT CASE. THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE TWENTY TWO WORKERS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SAME WOULD HELP WITH THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY -- THIS IS BEING DONE RETROACTIVELY WHICH IS COUNTER TO THE CUSTOM PRACTICE OF THIS BODY AND YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHY IS THIS A BUDGET BILL AND I SUBMIT THE ONLY REASON WHY IT'S BEING PROPOSED AS A BUDGET BILL. IS THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN APPLY THIS CHANGE WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT WITHOUT A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE AS THE CAN. THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES SO. A GUY I THINK IT'S THIS IS A DEPLORABLE INTERFERENCE ON A LOCAL ELECTION. I'M KIND OF A SHAME THAT WERE DOING IT IS EXACTLY THIS KIND OF ACTION. THAT OUR ROADS OUR CONSTITUENTS FAITH AND TRUST IN THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT. I DON'T THINK IT HAS A PLACE. IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND AND I HAVE MY APOLOGIES TO THERE'S ALSO AN ASSOCIATED APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR RELATED SIEU -- PROVIDING FUNDS TO THE COUNTY RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LANGUAGE SO IT IT THERE IS -- BUDGET ASPECT -- ON THE FISCAL SIDE TO THE AND ADMITTING THAT MY EARLIER TESTS OKAY [inaudible] INSTRUMENTS. AS I LIKED ALSO SPEAK ON THIS I'M FROM SAN DIEGO THAT WATCH THIS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH. S. PROSELYTIZED BY LITTLE EARLIER ON EDUCATION I WOULD DO IT AGAIN. POLICY BILLS WE HAVE POLICY COMMITTEES THEY SHOULD DO IT POLICIES THERE -- JUST BECAUSE WE CAN DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL RIGHT HERE. IT IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF OVERREACH INDIA AUTHORITY. OF THIS BODY TO INFLUENCE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS WRONG. IS CLEARLY WRONG. THIS SHOULD NOT BE BEING HEARD AND AND WHEN WE REFLECT BACK ON OURSELVES. THIS BILL RIGHT HERE SHOWS THE PROBLEM IN SACRAMENTO. WHAT WE'RE GOING THERE WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR POLITICAL INFLUENCE TO INFLUENCE SOMETHING DOWN THERE IN THE REGION WE KNOW WHY THE RESORT DOING THIS BECAUSE? THERE ARE LEADERS WITHIN THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO COME FROM SAN DIEGO. AND THEY ARE ABLE TO PUSH THESE THINGS THROUGH. AND THIS IS WRONG. IF THIS A SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING IT TO THE COMMITTEE BUT DO YOU. USE OUR MONEY. TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POLITICS. BECAUSE WE CAN [inaudible] IS WRONG AND I'LL BE STRONGLY VOTER YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS HOPE THE PRESS IS WATCHING THIS HELP DAN WALTERS WHO CAL MATTERS I HOPE. PODCAST COMES ON AND CAO CAO WORKS WHAT'S GOING ON IN SACRAMENTO. EVERYBODY SPEAK UP TO SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND SACRAMENTO. WE OVERSTATED OUR POSITION AND THIS IS THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE. OF ABUSE OF POWER [inaudible] BY THIS. BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS ASSEMBLY [inaudible] OKAY -- SEE NO OTHER.

JOSH DUGGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY ONES A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND WHICH CLARIFIES ALLOCATIONS BY THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FROM THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUND IN 200-011-1212 THIRTEEN AND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WERE CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION PROVIDED IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. ONE TWO FIVE THREE ONE SUBDIVISION <u>&lt;c.green&gt; ENACTING&lt;/c&gt;</u> THIS CLARIFICATION IS ALSO THE INTENT TO ABROGATE THE HOLDING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS RELATED TO THIS MATTER. HAVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I THINK MISTER. THANK YOU ACTUALLY I AS YOU'VE JUST REFERENCE SOMETHING THAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE IN THE ANALYSIS AND I JUST -- WAS A PRIZE THAT THIS DOES IMPACT -- AN APPELLATE COURT RULING THAT JUST CAME DOWN A FEW WEEKS AGO SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS. A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE DECIDED -- THAT -- THIS WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO AS OPPOSED. INTENT OF THE SETTLEMENT FUND WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO AND AND IS IS THIS LANGUAGE PART OF ANY AGREEMENT AROUND THE LAWSUIT OR HOW DOES THIS. IMPACT LAWSUIT IT'S IT'S THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNOR THAT THIS. AGGREGATES THE LAWSUIT AND AND IF WE TAKE THIS POSITION THAT THOUGHT THAT THIS WILL PREVAIL IN COURTS COULD YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH HOW THIS IMPACTS THE LAWSUIT. SO IT IT'S ARE -- POSITION -- THAT THE OPINION THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING HINGES ON THE THE FACT THAT OR THE FINDING THAT THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE MISINTERPRETED THE LEGISLATIVE A DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION IN ENACTING -- THE CURRENT STATUTE SO -- THIS IS MEANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE ALLOCATIONS MADE BY THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE WHERE IN FACT CONSISTENT WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S OUR POSITION THAT THAT YOU KNOW FURTHER MADE CLEAR BY THE FACT THAT THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE ALSO ACCORDING TO CURRENT. A STATUTE -- WAS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT -- SCHEDULES AND PLANS TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW AND THEN IN SUBSEQUENT. FISCAL YEARS INCLUDED -- THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS A APPROVED ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S OUR POSITION THAT THIS ADDRESSES THE CURRENT OPINION -- BUT I THERE'S ALSO LIKELY -- A SEEKING OF A REVIEW BY THE SOME SUPREME COURT ON THE MATTER AS WELL. OKAY TO SO AND AND IS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DID SOME YEARS BACK. I KNOW SO THIS IS -- STRICTLY CLARIFYING THAT THE ALLOCATIONS -- THAT WERE MADE AFTER THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE THE PRIOR STATUE THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING WORK CONSISTENT WITH THAT STATUTE AND FOR FOR IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE DISCUSSION THE CURRENT STATUTE READS NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW. THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE MAY ALLOCATE OR OTHER THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUND OFFSET GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES IN THE THREE FISCAL YEARS MENTIONED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THIS OR NOT I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT QUESTION. IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT. THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS OUT OF THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SPECIAL DEPOSIT FUND. WERE. A A LEGAL USE OF THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE FUND -- MONEY. SO IT IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S MAYBE FIRST IMPORTANT KIND OF SET THE STAGE IN THE BACKGROUND ON THE IS CHAU SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS -- IN RELIEF DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS -- ALSO THERE WAS A SEPARATE PART OF A SEPARATE POT OF MONEY AS PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WAS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE. US STATES THEMSELVES -- FOR DAMAGES AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE PROPERTIES PROPERTY TAX LOSSES INCOME TAX LOSSES EXPENDITURES THAT STATES MADE -- TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUENTS OTHER STATE -- AS CITIZENS OF THEIR STATE AND OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT SO -- THE POT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE JUST SUBJECT -- IN THE LAWSUIT IS THAT SECOND PART OF MONEY THAT WAS FOR THE STATE'S -- AND IT THIS -- DECISION WAS -- DURING THE RECESSION AND CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AND POT OF MONEY AND THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS WERE BASICALLY -- I IN SOME STATES WEIGHED IN WITH THEIR INTENT OF HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED -- THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL WEIGHED IN WITH A INTENT ON HOW THE FUNDS SHOULD BE USED -- HOWEVER -- THE STATE WAS FACED WITH THE RECESSION AND UNDERGOING DEEP BUDGET CUTS AT THE TIME AND SO THE STATE DID THE BEST -- THAT IT COULD -- TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES CONSISTENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S -- INTENT AND I THINK THAT THAT THE COURT AND HAS -- AGREED THAT SOME OF THE ALLOCATION OF THE FOUR HUNDRED TEN MILLION IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. INTENT -- BUT THESE SO MADE -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- THE RECESSION AND COMPETING PRIORITIES AT THE TIME AND TRYING TO AVOID -- EVEN DEEPER BUDGET CUTS AND AND AGAIN WERE MADE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION PROVIDED IN THE STATUTE. YOU SEE VERY WELL INFORMED ON THIS. HAVE YOU READ. THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE FUNDS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS SPECIFICALLY THE LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT MONEY GIVEN TO THE STATES SHOULD BE. I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD SPEAK TO THE EXACT LANGUAGE -- RIGHT NOW I COULD GIVE YOU AYE PERHAPS -- OVERVIEW OF THE CONSENT DECREE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INTENT OF FOR THE USE OF THE FUNDS ATOP AT THE FEDERAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND THAT LET ME LET ME READ YOU THE RELEVANT PIECES BECAUSE THIS IS. BUT WHAT THE COURT CASE WAS TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT. THE STATE'S EXPENDITURE OF THAT MONEY COMPLIED WITH THIS TERM OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. OUR AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SAYS SUCH FINE SHALL BE USED. TO AVOID PREVENTABLE FORECLOSURES TO AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS OF THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS TO ENHANCE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND PROSECUTE FINANCIAL FRAUD. OR UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES AND A COMPETENT IT'S COMPENSATE THE STATES FOR THE COSTS RESULTING FROM THE ALLEGED OUGHT UNLAWFUL CONTACT OF THE DEFENDANTS. SO THE APPEALS COURT SEGMENTED THOSE EXPENDITURES. AND THEY'VE DECIDED THAT OF THE FOREIGN TEN MILLION DOLLARS A CALIFORNIA RECEIVED -- THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SHOULD HAVE GONE TO FORECLOSURE RELIEF AND THE REST. WAS FREE THE STATE WAS FREE TO USE AS IT INTO -- ITSELF IT BECAUSE THAT PORTION COMPENSATED THE STATE'S FOR ITS COSTS SO WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN POSSIBLY ARGUE. THAT THAT MONEY SHOULDN'T GO. TO AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS OF THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS AS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS DICTATED. SO I I'D I DON'T I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU CAN ARGUE. WITH SOMETHING SO FORTHRIGHT. WHAT IF I THINK I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THE LANGUAGE -- AND CLARIFICATION THAT'S PART OF THIS TRAILER BILL -- IS IN RESPONSE -- TO THE THE OPINION THAT -- SPECIFICALLY HINGES ON FOR THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCES MISINTERPRETATION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE -- INTENDING TO ADDRESS WHERE FOR THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING OF AND YOU KNOW FOR FOR ALL OF US THERE TRY TO MAKE THIS DECISION A PART OF THIS BILL SAYS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS AWARE OF AND APPROVED THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS THAT'S IT THAT'S A LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WERE VOTING ON SO WE HAVE TO DECIDE. DO WE APPROVE OF THAT OUR AND IT SAYS EXPLICITLY WHEN THE STATE WAS GIVEN THAT MONEY THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT. TO AMELIORATE THE EFFECTS OF THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS WHICH IS NOT SPENDING IT. BOND BY FIXING THE DEFICIT OF OUR STATE DEPARTMENTS SO. I I THINK IT'S IT'S IAM INCREDULOUS. THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE THIS ACTION -- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S KIND OF IN A LITTLE HOLE HERE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THIS ADVERSE APPEALS COURT RULING. BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE COMPLICIT [inaudible] IN. GIVEN MY APPROVAL TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS WRONG AND I THINK THAT THAT THREE AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD GO TO THE VICTIMS. A OF THAT FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND NOT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD. STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE NEED TO GIVE.
