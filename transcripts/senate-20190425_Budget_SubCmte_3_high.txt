OKAY ALRIGHT WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN. AND ISSUE NUMBER ONE MEDICAL OR DENTAL SERVICES. SO -- IT IN TERMS OF AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH UTILIZATION WE ARE SEEING POSITIVE MOVEMENT IT'S IT'S SLOW AND IT'S NOT AS FAT YOU KNOW HIGH AND FAST AS WE WANT -- WITH RESPECT TO KIDS WE SEE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT WHO ARE GETTING ANNUAL DENTAL VISIT ABOUT 44%. PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND THEN WE WE DON'T A COUPLE OF THINGS TO TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IS IT THAT THE SAME KIDS ARE COMING IN EVERY YEAR OR IS THAT YOUR THEIR KIDS ARE NOT COMING. EVERY YEAR BUT THEY'RE COMING SOMETIMES AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WE SEE ABOUT 54% OF TWO YEARS WE SEE ABOUT 70% OF THE KIDS. SO THAT WITH THAT WHICH IS HELPFUL FOR US TO SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT HALF THE KIDS AREN'T GETTING SERVICES IS THAT THEY'RE NOT COMING IN ANNUALLY. SO THAT'S HELPING US AS WE THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT WE WANT TO DO FOR THE FUTURE ON THE ADULT SIDE YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL PRETTY LOW POST EXPANSION WE HAVE 23% WHO ARE GETTING AN ANNUAL DENTAL VISIT. US ABOUT 14% PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND THEN AGAIN FOR USING THOSE OTHER. THE NATION'S -- ABOUT 27% IN A SINGLE YEAR AND WE SEE ABOUT 39% OVER TWO YEARS. SO STILL NOT GREAT NUMBERS BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO YOU -- WORK ON GETTING THOSE UP AND AGAIN WE ARE SEEING SORT OF IT TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND A LOT OF THAT I THINK DOES HAVE TO DO WITH AND THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD FOLLOWING WHICH WAS REALLY ABOUT THE OUTREACH EFFORTS. TO WE HAVE AN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME FOR BOTH SO I I DON'T THINK ANY TO SPLIT BETWEEN KIDS AND ADULTS BUT WE HAVE A A NEW OUTREACH CAMPAIGN CALLED SMILE CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN WEBSITE SMILE CALIFORNIA DOT ORG FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO. CHECK IT OUT -- AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBER RESOURCES ON THAT WE HAVE FAQS BULLETINS WE HAVE VIDEOS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW TO ACCESS THE SERVICES -- SO THAT'S REALLY A BIG PLACE FOR FOR BOTH ADULTS AND KIDS IN ADDITION WE DO HAVE -- DELTA DENTAL IS GOING TO LOCAL COMMUNITY -- PLACES LIKE THE WICK OFFICE IS IN A MEETING DIRECTLY WITH MEMBERS OF THEIR TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR SERVICES -- AND THEN FROM THE ADULT SIDEOR I GUESS THIS IS TRUE FOR KIDS DO WE DO WHAT WE DO ALSO HAVE ADULT IS DOING LOTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS. AND ALSO DOING -- IF PEOPLE AGREE DOING TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS OF LIKE WHEN YOU'RE DUE FOR A VISIT OR IF YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO. THOSE ARE REALLY THE THINGS WERE FOCUSED ON AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE STILL HAVE THE PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY IN THE DTI. AND IT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THOSE LATER TODAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM OHIO. FINANCE. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SO X. SO IN TERMS OF OUT REACH A AND APPRECIATE -- MAY THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING -- SINCE YOU'RE ALSO THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES WRIT LARGE -- IF -- I DON'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE -- IS THERE ANY EFFORT TO THINK ABOUT HOW. SAMPLED THE PEDIATRICIANS AND FAMILY PHYSICIANS OR SEEING THE% KIDS MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP OUT AND GETTING KIDS AND I WILL TELL YOU IS A PEDIATRICIAN WHO TOOK CARE MEDI CAL PATIENTS. BY BIGGER CHALLENGE WAS ACTUALLY AT THAT TIME WAS ACTUALLY FINDING SOMEONE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY SEE THEM. I WOULD TELL THEM THEY NEED TO BE SEEN I'D EVEN CALL AND TRY TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT AND SOMETIMES HAD TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH. SO I ASSUME WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT PROBLEM BUT AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. WE DO REMIND THEM THAT ARE WELL CHILD VISITS THAT THEY NEED TO GET THEIR TEETH EXAMINED -- THE FIRST TO THIRD BIRTHDAY SO FORTH -- BUT THINKING ABOUT THAT AND THEN ALSO I WOULD SAY WHAT ABOUT A WEEK OFFICES AS WELLS ARE TALKING MONEY TRADITION A HAVE YOU GOTTEN YOUR DENTAL CHECKUP YET. AND SO FORTH SO -- ESPECIALLY ON THE KIDS PART WHETHER WE CAN DO SOME OUT REACH WITH OTHER PROVIDERS -- TO ALSO BY THE WAY ARE YOU GUYS AND AND STATE PROGRAMS. SO DEFINITELY ON THE AS I MENTIONED WE ARE DOING DELTA DOES GO TO LITTLE LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS LIKE WEEK OFFICES TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH -- MEMBERS AND THEN I WOULD SAY ON THE OTHER PIECE -- FROM A PIECE OF LEGISLATION FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE INCREASE THE REQUIREMENTS ON OUR HEALTH PLANS TO HAVE -- ESSENTIALLY DIRECT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS AND YOU KNOW THE DOCTORS AND THEN HOW TO GET TO THE DENTAL SERVICES SINCE IT'S NOT IN THAT MODE OF MEDI CAL MASTER PLAN BUT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. BOTH SIDES BOTH THE DENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE KNEW WHO THEY SHOULD CONTACT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THE SERVICES IN THE MULTI DIRECTIONAL. SERVICES AND IF YOU WANT THAT WE CAN I JUST SAY THE OBVIOUSLY THE PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX FUNDING HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN A VARIETY OF WAYS ALSO WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE AND THEN AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- JANUARY PROPOSAL AROUND VALUE BASED PURCHASING THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INCENTIVES ON THE WELL CHILD AREA THAT WE'VE PROPOSED THAT WOULD -- ALLOW FOR PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO BE DOING DENTAL SEALANTS AND HAVING THAT BE A COMPONENT SO YOU KNOW A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- BOTH INTERVENTIONS AND INTERACTIONS THAT WE'VE TRIED FROM A MULTI YOU KNOW MULTITUDE OF AREAS TO TRY TO KIND OF CAPTURE THIS POPULATION BOTH IN THE PROVIDER OFFICES. FROM A PEDIATRICIAN AREA CLINIC AREA AS WELL AS IN THE DENTAL PROVIDERS THEMSELVES OKAY YEAH THE CERTAINLY THIS NOTE SEALANTS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO IN THE OFFICE AND I APPRECIATE THE MEDI CAL DOES NOW DOES REIMBURSED FOR THAT -- SAYS THAT THE YOU OUT TERMS OF GETTING ACTUALLY INTO DENTAL CARE AND WHETHER SOME MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE THAT'S ALL TELL YOU KNOW I MEAN THEY GET IT'S A WHILE AGO BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I COULD GET THROUGH TO ANYONE EXCEPT FIRST ASK THE PATIENT. AND THEN THEY COME BACK SAID HAVE YOU SEEN A DENTIST YET WELL WE'VE TRIED AND I'M LIKE OKAY. AND IT ACTUALLY SAID WILL DEAL TO BE ON BOARD IT IS I'M A CALM RIGHT NOW AND MAKE THE APPOINTMENT FOR YOU AND THEN I FIND OUT I CAN'T GET THROUGH. RIGHT SO -- WHETHER THERE'S SOME WAY -- TO TO SO IT'S REALLY WORKS THAT SOME OF THE DENTAL PLANS FOR ON THE MEDICARE SIDE BUT THE FEE FOR SERVICE I WERE SOME MECHANISM BY WHICH A AND MORE TO THE S.. A PHYSICIAN WHO WHO'S NOTICES THAT THE TEETH LOOK BAD BECAUSE WE DO LOOK IN THE MOUTH -- AND SAY WILL YOU NEED SEE DENTAL CARE CAN CAN SOMEHOW YOU KNOW. CALL SOMEONE TO HAVE SOMEONE THEN TAKE IT FROM THERE. AND SIX A DUMP THAT BE GREAT YES ANDERSON -- DEVICE WHEN A COMPLIMENT YOU ON REACHING OUT AT THE WAKE CENTERS FOR FOR THE DENTAL SERVICES ARE WE ALSO GOING TO REGIONAL CENTERS AND NOT BECAUSE THAT'S A WHOLE. DIFFERENT CHALLENGE THAT -- I HEARD. FIVE AFTER. THAT MIGHT BE A GREAT PLACE TO THAT -- KNOW THAT DAY THEY COULD BE THERE YEAH YEAH THANK YOU. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE TOUCH LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE BRING THAT ALL TOGETHER. SO. SO I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S GOING UP HEY IT'S STILL AS YOU POINTED OUT NOT VERY GOOD -- AND THE TRUE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS IS THAT -- PEOPLE GET MORE OR HEALTH PROBLEMS SO I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE WANNA BUMP IT UP THAT ARE AS YOU SAY. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HOW HIGH IT IS IS THIS IS THE RIGHT NUMBER AT THE RIGHT TIME RIGHT AND I WOULD STILL SAY THAT PROBABLY THAT'S WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE WERE STILL AT THE LOW END AND THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO -- SO WHAT'S THE GOAL THEN WERE AT FORTY THREE POINT. NINE THE HOPE IS THAT I MEAN I KNOW IF SO BUT SO UNDER THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE THE MOLE -- WAS TO GO UP TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS -- FROM THE BASE OVER THE FIVE YEARS RENTS WHAT BUT THAT WAS ONLY HOW HIGH THAT WAS IT. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE FIFTY FIFTY FOUR YEAH. I DON'T KNOW I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW THAT I MIGHT HAVE IT IN HERE IF I ACTUALLY THERE IS A LOW NUMBER TO A NOT SO LOW NUMBER IT'S 10% AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EASY TO DO THE 10%. EVEN EVEN AT 10% IT'S THE WHOLE YEAH AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND HIS MERRY SAID THE NUMBERS DEPENDING ON HOW YOU CUT THEM WHETHER THEY COME IN ANNUALLY OR THEY COME IN EVERY SIX MONTHS AS AS RECOMMENDED. I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AT LEAST A 60% GLOBALIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN AND SO THAT IS KIND OF CERTAINLY THE OVERALL GOAL AND I KNOW THAT -- UNDER THE DTI WE HAVE BEEN -- IMPROVING OUR UTILIZATION MORE THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY AGREED TO RISE TO TERMS OF THE WAIVER SO I THINK. YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BUT AGAIN WE'RE STILL ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT AT LEAST 60% WOULD BE KIND OF THE THE PLACE IN WHICH WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT TO BE ACCEPTABLE OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO. I THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STRETCH GOALS IS BECAUSE BECAUSE EVEN AT THE GOAL WE SAT. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID IT THERE AND THERE'S SOME CONSEQUENCES NOT MEETING THAT PARTICULAR GOAL. EVEN WE HAD IT I'M LIKE OKAY THAT'S BETTER. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD YET AND SO AND SO THE HOPE I HOPE WE CAN THINK BEYOND AND AND AND THEN AND THEN HAVE PEOPLE THINK OKAY -- IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO HIT THAT GOAL IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO LEAP BEYOND IT. AND SEE WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO ALL RIGHT. AS IT IS I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT OKAY RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO I THINK WE HAVE ON THE OF THE FUSION CYCLICALS YEAH. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WELL WE DO HAVE OKAY AS ANYTHING ELSE ON ON THE OVERVIEW ALRIGHT SO WE DO HAVE TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS. READY TO THAT THAN TO CAL OVERVIEW CELL ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK YOU TO SHIFT AROUND AND MAKE SOME ROOM. FOR HIS PROPOSALS. SHE CAN SHIFT AROUND TO SHE WANTED TO BUT THAT'S OKAY SHE WASN'T. BEEN EDGING TO GET OUT OF OKAY NO NO THAT'S GOOD I CAN UNDERSTAND THANKS THAT'S ALMOST THAT'S HOW MY SON FEELS ABOUT THESE THINGS TO USE LIKE OKAY GIVE ME ON THE SPOT RIGHT NOW. I'M TOO CLOSE TO YOU. ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA FIRST START OFF WE HAVE A THE PROPOSAL FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR CLARIFYING THE SALVATION OF PATIENTS FOR CLINICS AND WE HAVE. WHO'S PRESENTING HERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO -- YEAH WE ASK THREE MINUTES FOR THE PRESENTATION MAX FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS. A GOOD MORNING AT CHERRY MEMBERS I AM ERRORS ALL THE NAVARRO WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP -- TCP IS REQUESTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO MAKE SPECIFIC THE INTENT OF LEGISLATION WAS PASSED SPONSORED IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR THAT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND RURAL HEALTH CENTERS MAY ESTABLISH A PATIENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF BILLING THROUGH STORE AND FORWARD TYLER DENTISTRY. WE SPONSORED AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR SO THAT SUCCESSFUL VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME -- COULD SPREAD -- TO REACH MORE UNDERSERVED CHILDREN AND ADULTS ESPECIALLY THOSE ENROLLED IN MY ACCOUNT TO REDUCED HEALTH ORAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. IN FACT AROUND AS WE HEARD AROUND 50% OF CHILDREN RULED IN MEDIC HOW -- DON'T GET OR RECEIVE LIMITED -- DENTAL SERVICES AT ALL. THE VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME OUR SYSTEM ADDRESSES BARRIERS SUCH AS THE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IN ABILITY TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND THE AND THE LIKE BY PROVIDING DENTAL CARE. COMMUNITY SETTING SUCH AS SCHOOLS HEAD START SITES AND I'M NURSING HOMES THIS TECHNICAL FIX -- THAT WE ARE REQUESTING WILL ENSURE THAT THE VIRTUAL DONE A HOME CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON REDUCING ORAL HEALTH DISPARITIES -- AND TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN MY HAND IT OVER. TO THE CLASS. DR PROGRESS FOR YOU TO RECEIVE PACIFIC SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND I KNOW DOCTOR PAN YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE VIRTUAL DEL HOME SYSTEM BUT FOR THE RECORD IT'S A SYSTEM THAT WAS. ESTABLISHED DESIGN AND ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE DENTED CAL BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GETTING DENTAL CARE AND THIS IS A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THE FABULOUS NEW PREVENTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE KNOW CAN ACTUALLY KEEP MOST PEOPLE HEALTHY AND COMMUNITY SITES LIKE SCHOOLS AND HEAD START CENTERS AND REGIONAL CENTER -- HOMES AND THIS IS A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE SPECIALLY TRAINED DENTAL HYGIENISTS AND ASSISTANTS ACTUALLY GO INTO THOSE COMMITTEE LOCATIONS. THE EVIL TO USES PREVENTIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ABLE. TO WEBER WITH DENNIS FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND MORE COMPLICATED SERVICES AND REACH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GETTING CARE OTHERWISE. NOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT FOR A HEALTH CENTER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. SYSTEM THEY HAVE TO ESTABLISH A PATIENT AS THEIR PATIENT AND SO IN A IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BILL ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HEALTH CENTERS COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE LANGUAGE AND THAT BILL WAS ACTUALLY THE FACE TO FACE CONTACT. BETWEEN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PATIENTS NOT REQUIRED ON THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. PURTELL OPTIMAL G. TOLD ARE INTELLIGENT TELL DENTISTRY BY STORE AND FORWARD. UNFORTUNATELY WE BECOME TO REALIZE MORE RECENTLY. THAT IT WASN'T COMPLETELY CLEAR IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THAT BILL THAT THAT ALSO ALLOWED THE HEALTH CENTER TO ESTABLISH THE PATIENT BY CONTACTING THE PATIENT OUT IN THE SCHOOL USING STORE AND FORWARD TOLD DENTISTRY SO. THE TECHNICAL FIXES BEING PROPOSED NOW WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE SPECIFIC THE INTENT OF THAT BILL FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN BY SPECIFYING THAN RAC OR OR FQHC. CAN ESTABLISH A PATIENT USING STORE AND FORWARD TELE DENTISTRY. ON THE PROPOSAL NOT TRYING TO ESTABLISH ANYTHING NEW IT'S ONLY TRYING TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONTINUE TO DO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERING THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO KEEP THIS PROJECT WHICH IS REACHING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GOING BACK THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ANY OBSERVATIONS FROM THE PARK HAS A SERVICES -- AO. FINANCE COMMENTS OKAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SO WHICH I DID HAVE A QUESTION JUST FOR THE THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES SO THIS PROPOSAL IS OF COURSE. WE HAVE -- TELE DENTISTRY IT'S BUT IT'S BASED DATA COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTER RIGHT SO LET'S CUT CALATHEA ON THE WALLS BUT WITHIN THE ALSO. WHEN IT COMES TO PPS AND SO FORTH THERE THERE'S SOME ISSUES WITH THIS THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN RELATION TO POLICY THAT YOU HAVE REGARDING -- FQHCS AND ART SEES -- AND BE ABLE TO DO THIS -- TELE DENTISTRY FROM. THOSE BASES I WOULD I WOULD HAVE -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OKAY X. AROUND THE PROPOSAL BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- CLINICS THEY ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE PATIENCE ESTABLISHED PATIENTS I'VE SEEN IN A DENTAL CLINICOUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY WE HAVE THEN YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. OKAY YES THAT OUR CLASS AND MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT ISSUE WHICH IS THAT. THERE WAS SOME CONCERN RAISED ABOUT THE SEPARATE MECHANISM WHICH IS THAT HEALTHCARE IS ALLOWED TO CONTRACT WITH OUTSIDE PROVIDERS. AND THERE'S SOME CONCERN ABOUT PATIENT GOING RIGHT TO THE OUTSIDE PROVIDER NOT BEING ESTABLISHED FIRST AND SO IN THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO TRY TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THIS IS NOT THAT. THIS IS A HEALTH CENTER USING ITS OWN EMPLOYEES IN THEIR OWN EITHER REGISTERED A LICENSED OR INSIGHTS OF CERTAIN PLEASE OUR OWN SITES IT'S NOT THE CONTRACT. SO WE TRY TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT NOT SPILLING OVER TO AND DOES SO -- SO CERTAINLY VERY SYMPATHETIC WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I JUST WANNA BE SURE TO TO OUR CONNECTING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THE OF CMS RULES YES THE RULES AND THEN HOW THEY ALL INTERFACE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE WHAT I THANK YOU DESIRE -- INSIDE SO I APPRECIATE THAT CERTAINLY IN DEVELOPING YOUR LANGUAGE YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT IT'S THE DECISION WILL BE MADE BY THE AGENCY'S WHETHER IT'S OUT OR NOT SO I THINK HOPEFULLY THAT DIALOGUE WILL HELP -- LEAD TO IF THE THE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WHICH THAT DIALOGUE OKAY -- ENCOURAGED THE DIALOGUE SO -- ALL RIGHT OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OF A MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND THAT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL FROM. ON SILVER DYNAMITE FLUORIDE COVERAGE AND DENTAL CAROLINE WITH THE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION HERE FOR THAT. I'M NOT SURE WHY I SEEM TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT THE DENTAL PROPOSALS. OKAY -- WONDERFUL HOW ARE EIGHTEEN ANOTHER CHAIR OKAY. DO I INTRODUCED YOUR LITTLE ONE FIRST WE WILL TAKE THAT OFF YOUR TIME [inaudible] TELL ME. THIS IS LILAH BLANCHARD I LEVEL. SHE'S FOUR YEARS OLD -- WONDERFUL ALL RIGHT WELL WELCOME. ALL RIGHT SO ALL RIGHT SO THREE MINUTES TOTAL. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS -- AN INSTRUCTOR STUFF ME SEND RT. ACCESSING DENTIST HERE IN SACRAMENTO I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CDA WAS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DENTISTS ACROSS THE STATE. TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SILVER DIAMINE FLORIDA MEDICAL DENTAL BENEFIT. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE FDA APPROVED STF PAVING THE WAY FOR WIDESPREAD USE IN THE US. AND IT HAS BEEN USED IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA. FOR DECADES AND IS CURRENTLY IN ESTABLISHED MEDICAID BENEFITS SEVERAL OR STATES SUCH AS OREGON. PRIVATE COMMERCIAL DENTAL INSURANCE PLANS ARE REIMBURSING FOR THE STF CODE AND PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR THIS ALTERNATIVE CARRIES ARRESTING METHOD -- STF IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL IN THE CARE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THE FOR FRAIL ELDERLY PATIENTS YOUNG CHILDREN AND CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE TRADITIONAL FRUSTRATIONS. ALTHOUGH STF IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL PATIENTS IT IS A LOW COST SAFE NON SURGICAL APPROACH THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INJECTABLE DENTAL ANESTHETICS. SEDATION OR DRILLING. I HAVE STAFF DOES NOT FULLY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR TRADITIONAL DENTAL CARE -- BUT IT DOES ARE DIRECTLY. WHEN IT'S PLACED DIRECTLY ON THE DECAY ARE STOP THE DAYCARE FROM FORGETTING FURTHER OR SLOW IT DOWN -- AS ARRESTING THE DECAY MAY ALLOW FOR A CHILD TO BECOME MORE COOPERATIVE AS THEY GET OLDER -- OR EVEN THE BABY TO TO FALL OUT WITHOUT THE NEED FOR TRADITIONAL RESTORATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE MAIN SIDE EFFECT OF STF IS THOUGHT THE APPLICATION OF THE LIQUID SIGNIFICANTLY DOES COLORS THE TOOTH INTO A DARK BLACK COLOR. WELL THIS ON A STATIC SIDE EFFECTS CAN BE TROUBLESOME I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THIS RESULT. I IN THE RIGHT SITUATION FURTHERMORE SB HOT ONE ONE FOUR EIGHT REQUIRES THAT PROVIDERS DISCUSS THE SIDE EFFECTS. AND OBTAIN INFORMED CONSENT PRIOR TO TREATMENT. AS A PRIVATE PRACTITIONER -- I ACTUALLY APPLIED STF TO A TWO YEAR OLD AND EVEN A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD LAST WEEK -- THE TWO YEAR OLD HAD BABY BOTTLE TO QUE IN THEM ON DECIDED TO CHOOSE -- STF OVER TRADITIONAL NITROUS OXIDE INJECTIONS A NORMAL FEELINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- THE NINETY TWO YEAR OLD HAD DEMENTIA AND HIS FAMILY DID NOT WANT. TO EXPAND YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND ENERGY INTO RESTORING HIS TEETH SO WE'RE ABLE TO REMOVE THE DECAY QUICKLY PLACE STF AND GO ABOUT OUR WAY. SO EXPANDING COVERAGE OF STF AS A MEDICAL DENTAL BENEFIT WOULD ENCOURAGE PROVIDERS TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS FOR KERRY'S MANAGEMENT. THAT EXTEND BEYOND MORE TRADITIONAL AND BASS OF RESTORATIVE THERAPIES. AS THE OFFICE CURRENTLY BEING CORPORATE INTO MONEY DOWN TO A PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE AND THEREFORE IS SIGNAL AGING HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. SB ONE ONE FOUR EIGHT WOULD ALLOW ACCESS TO THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO PATIENTS IN THE DENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS ANGELA BLANCHARD HERE TODAY AS A PARENT WHO CHOSE STF FOR HER DâN THREE YEAR OLD NOW BIG GIRL FOUR YEAR OLD. HI LAST FALL WE WERE SHOCKED TO LEARN AT A ROUTINE DENTAL APPOINTMENT AND THAT OUR DAUGHTER HAD SIGNIFICANT DECAY AND ONE OF HER TEETH AND OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THAT SHE'S THREE YEARS OLD WE WERE NOT GOING TO CHOOSE A DRILL OR OTHER MORE TRADITIONAL RESTORATIVE PROCEDURES. ARE DENNIS EXPLAINED TO US THE STF WAS GOING TO BE A FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AND THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR. AND IF WHEN AND SHOULD THAT CAVITY BECOME BIGGER THAN WE WOULD HAVE TO EXPLORE MORE TRADITIONAL OPTIONS. SO SHE JUST HAD HER APPOINTMENT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND GREAT NEWS WE HAVE AND NOT ONLY HAS THE DECAY COMPLETELY STOPPED BUT THE TWO SCINTIGRAPHY APPEARS ACTION TO BE BETTER. MY HUSBAND AND I OPTED TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE OUT OF POCKET WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S NOT VIABLE FOR EVERY WORKING FAMILY AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF CITIES PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DID AT THE TIME OF IT IT'S A GOOD ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT. OKAY -- ANY THOUGHTS FROM OUR HEALTHCARE SERVICES NO ALEJO FINANCE. BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBER CSS UNDERTONE THANK YOU -- COULD YOU JUST -- CAPITAL ABOUT HOW THE SILVER DIAMOND FLUORIDE IS -- CAP APPETITE IS IT IS IT LIKE YOUR OLD FLUORIDE TREATMENTS AND LITTLE -- IT'S VERY SIMILAR -- SO IT'S ON A TOOTH BY TOOTH BASIS IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S APPLIED TO EVO MOUTH LIKE FLUORIDE WOULD BE TRADITIONALLY -- TYPICALLY WE USE A A SMALL HAND INSTRUMENT TO EITHER SCRIPTED K. OUT OR A VERY SLOW ROUND BURGER WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST. VERY SLOWLY REMOVING ANY SOFTER OR STICKY MESS OUT OF THE TOOTH AND THEN THE STF IS APPLIED IT'S A CLEAR LIQUID IT'S APPLIED WITH A BRUSH DIRECTLY TO THE DECAY -- IT TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE THE DARK COLOR STARTS TO SET IN AND THE DARK COLOR ONLY SETS IN WHERE TO QUE IS SO IT DOESN'T COLOR THE ENTIRE TO SPOCK JUST WHERE THE COMPANY WAS SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S NOT A PRESENT A PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT. IS -- IT'S AN AND Q. TREATMENT -- FRONT FOR DENTAL CARE IS HE DIAGNOSED AS PRESIDENT -- IN ORDER TO USE IT NOW YOU COULD PLACE IT IN THE GROUP'S PROVOCATIVELY ALMOST LIKE A SEALANT YOU COULD SY BUT IF THERE'S NO ACTUAL TO KATE WILL NOT BONTA THE TOOTH -- AND IT WILL NOT TURN THE THE TO STARK I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS MY GRANDDAUGHTERS A SIX YEAR OLD AUTISTIC CHILD THEY FOUND SHE HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT THE K.. AND THAT ACTUALLY AND THAT'S A SIZER TO TO DO THE WORK TO BE NICE TO KNOW OF THIS TREATMENT BUT WHICH MUCH FOR NON INVASIVE -- COULD HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR HER SO THANK YOU FOR EDUCATING ME ON IT. RIGHT -- SO EXIT AND THEN NINETIES YOU JUST SPOKE TO THE STORY OF I JUST WONDER. IF THEY HAVE YOU EXPLAIN AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE SO THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS I'VE HEARD ABOUT. THIS TREATMENT US SORT I MIGHT IS IS THAT IS IS THE ASCETIC AFFECT THE BLACK NEED TO SO. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE GONE AROUND CALLING -- YOU HAVE THE BLACK TO SPILL HER EIGHT AND AND AND I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE AESTHETICS IS IMPORTANT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO AROUND WITH THE DARK TEASE THAT MAY. HAVE BEEN DONE FROM LETS IT FLY MAKE THEM -- ANXIOUS TO APPLY FOR A JOB OR MAKE FRIENDS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND CERTAINLY IS A DENTIST I KNOW YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS -- TO PEOPLES -- YOU KNOW THE WELLBEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY AS WELL OF COURSE OR HEALTH. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE SAY WELL I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID YOU'LL DENNIS AGAIN USES TOO MUCH AND NOW WE ARE AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HARMED BECAUSE WELL CERTAINLY YEAH WE'RE STUCK HERE TO DECAY BUT THERE MIGHT BE A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO OVER USE THAT. AND NOW PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING I FEEL ASHAMED OF THEIR TEETH AND SO FORTH. SO IT IS IT IS IS THAT A REAL ANY AND HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN IS THAT. IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT COMES UP FOR WITH PARENTS ESPECIALLY IN NO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY YOUNG CHILDREN THAT WE TYPICALLY USE THIS ON OR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS -- WITH THE THE LIKE THE YOUNGEST I'VE USED IT ON HIS ONE YEAR OLD IT'S IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT A ONE YEAR OLD TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW SENATE DENTAL CHAIR AND GET NITROUS OXIDE OR GO UNDER SEDATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO KIND OF PAUSE THE DECAY AND MAYBE EVEN SAVE THE TOOTH FROM EXTRACTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT UNTIL THE PATIENT IS. OLD ENOUGH TO SIT IN THE DENTAL CHAIR AND DO NOT YOU KNOW REGULAR TRADITIONAL. RESTORATIONS OR IF THEY'RE OLDER YOU KNOW THE OLDER THEY GET. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SAFER OR IT COULD BE TO PUT THEM UNDER AN ASCETIC ARE GENERAL ISSUES ARE SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. IT'S JUST ANOTHER TOOL WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR BAG OF TRICKS TO HELP STOP DECAY AND AND KEEP TEETH AROUND OKAY SO YOU CAN QUITE ANSWER MY QUESTION WITH. THAT THIS SO I APPRECIATE IT'S ANOTHER TOOL RIGHT. BUT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID I'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS THAT. IT'S A TOOL IF IT'S BUSINESS AS A CONSEQUENCE WHEN IT'S USED AND IF IT'S OVER USED. RIGHT. SO NO IT'S OKAY AND I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER DO THIS BUT NOW IT'S OKAY SOME DATA SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO USE A LOT OF IT I CAN BILL FOR AT NOW THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY UPPER SAY THE PATIENT TO GET IT. AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE PATIENTS GOING AROUND WITH BLACK TEAS AND THOU THERE YOU KNOW AND I I GUESS I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A WAY TO REVERSE THE BLACKNESS ITS SILVER DINER SO IT THAT TENDS TO GET. PRETTY IMBEDDED IN THERE BUT EXACTLY HOW BLACK TO THE TEETH TURN AND IS THERE A WAY AND AND AND WHAT'S THE DEAL WHAT IS THAT THE RISK OF OF THAT KIND OF HARM POTENTIALLY HAPPENING. SO SOON AS HE'S QUITE DARK OR ONE NOT I'M SURE CUT BY. THAT TIME IT IS QUITE DARK ITEM AND YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT'S I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE INFORMED CONSENT REALLY HAS TO COME INTO PLAY I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE DOCTORS ARE GOING TO OVER USE IT I DON'T THINK THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS THAT AREN'T. OVER USED OR NOT UNDER UNDER USED. BUT IT'S FOR SURE A CONCERN I A SHOW ALL OF MY PATIENTS THE PICTURES OF IT SO THAT THE PARENTS CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION -- BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO COVER UP THE BLACK YOU CAN PUT REGULAR FILLING OVER ME ARE ON TOP OF IT AND KIND OF BLENDED IN WITH THE TO THE LITTLE BIT MORE -- I'VE DONE NOT FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE MORE COOPERATIVE AND THEY'RE STILL NOT GETTING ANESTHETICS ARE STILL NOT GETTING DRILLED ON OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT DOES COVER IT UP SO IT'S NOT AS DARK IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT GRAY KIND OF A GREATER TONE -- SO THERE ARE WAYS OF MAKING IT LOOK MORE AESTHETIC -- MORE AESTHETIC -- I THINK IT'S MOSTLY A CONCERN FOR FRONT TEETH I DON'T THINK PARENTS ARE SINCERELY CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT THE BACK TEETH IT'S MORE WHEN IT IS CLEAN THE FRONT TEETH -- AND SO I THINK THAT SHE MAY HAVE SOME SOME GOOD COMMENTS GOOD KNOWING THAT HER DAUGHTER HAS HAD IT. BEST SO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT SO WE WE WERE WELL AWARE THAT THE TOOTH MAY BECOME DARKER AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR BLACK TO USE IT'S REALLY SCARY. LIFELESS TO THIS NOT BLACK IT IS IT IS DARK WHERE THE TWO K. WISE AND IT LOOKS ACTUALLY LIKE A SMALL SILVER FILLING. I SHE ONE OF HER MOUTH TO SHOW YOU I TRIED OUT -- FIVE JUSTIN. BUT IT'S AND YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WAYNE THE OPTIONS IT WAS STF OR ANASTASIA AND I'M SORRY BUT AS A PARENT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE STF OVER ANASTASIA ANY DAY. AND WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AND ULTIMATELY IF WE NEEDED TO EXPLORE FURTHER OPTIONS WITH OUR DENTIST WE WOULD DO THAT BUT YOU KNOW A BLACK SMALL BLACK SPOT IS IS. RELATIVELY SMALL PRICE TO PAY. AND IN THE END YOU MENTIONED ONLY THE REALLY ONLY STICKS TO THE PART THAT WAS THE CASE SO IT'S NOT LIKE ONE TO APPLIES IT IT'S GOING LIKE COME ALL OF THE TEETH IT'S JUST KIND OF THE SPOTS GOING TO THE DARK SPOTS GOING TO BE WEIRD AT THE K.. WHATSOEVER DECAY AS I MEAN I THE MOVE DOCUMENT ACTUALLY COVERS THE WHOLE TOOTH WHEN YOU'RE PLACING IT THERE'S NO WAY TO PREVENT THAT -- HOWEVER IT WILL ONLY SIXTEEN WHERE TO QUE OKAY -- SOMETIMES IT CAN STAY IN THE GUMS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THERE'S BACTERIA PRESENT ON THE GUMS BUT THAT WAS A A TRANSIENT THING IT WILL GO AWAY WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS OF BRUSHING THE BLACK SPOT WILL STAY PERMANENT -- UNTIL THE TO THIS EITHER FOLD OR FALLS OUT OR WHATEVER HAPPENS THAT TOO SO IT'S ONLY COMES BACK TO ME AND SAYS OH THAT'S THAT BLACK TO THING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S ALL THEIR TEETH OR TALKING ABOUT BLACKNESS WHERE DID THE QUE WAS BUT IT'S AND IT'S NOT. GOING TO STICK TO THE REST OF THE TEETH CORRECT ONLY WHERE THE DECAY WAS WILL IT STAY DARK RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A SENSE OF THE CABLE. BUT STILL IT'S IT'S ONLY WITH THE CASES OKAY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WITH THAT -- WILL GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON MEDICAL DENTAL SERVICES DEAL REVIEW AND THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS AND SENATOR STONE I JUST WOULDN'T WANT A I GOT A RESPONSE.

LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THIS OVERSIGHT AS ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICES BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE AS EVIDENCED IN THAT THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS -- CONSIDERING THE LOW GROWTH OF THAT ACCOUNT PROVIDERS IN FEE FOR SERVICE VERSES SACRAMENTO DENTAL MANAGED CARE 2% VERSUS NEARLY 50% WE WOULD RECOMMEND REACHING OUT TO DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO SEE IF THERE ARE RECRUITMENT PRACTICES TO REPLICATE. AND AT THE AT THE ALICE'S INDICATE LESS THAN 14% OF MEDI CAL ADULTS RECEIVED A DENTAL PREVENTED OF SERVICE IN THE PAST YEAR SO WOULD SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN HOMES AS WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD INCREASE PREVENTATIVE UTILIZATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. BUT IT'S NOW WHAT'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE'RE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORTER THE VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LANGUAGE ACCESS AND THE DENTAL PROGRAM -- YOU'VE RECEIVED ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS BEING DENIED A LANGUAGE ACCESS SERVICES AND SEE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CONSUMERS BEING SERVED TO THE TELEPHONE SERVICE LINE -- SO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME.

THANK YOU. WELCOME. A BREANNA PITTMAN SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION -- OBVIOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF STF BUT ALSO OF THAT VIRTUAL DOWN HOME PROPOSAL -- I THINK JUST ONE ECHOES IN THE COMMENTS OF YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE GROWTH IN BOTH UTILIZATION AND PROVIDER ENROLLMENT NOT AS MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE EXTRA RATES BOTH THROUGH THE DTI INTHE FIFTY SIX ARE WORKING AND WANT. TO CONTINUE THAT AND WANT THE STABILITY THERE -- IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING FOR US WHEN WE START TO GET CALLS FROM OUR MEMBERS COMPLEMENTING DONE ACCOUNTING HEY THIS IS ACTUALLY GREAT THIS IS WORKING. THOSE ARE -- SOMETIMES NEW CALLS FOR US SO IT'S ALWAYS GOOD RATHER THAN THE COMPLAINT CALLS THAT WE HISTORICALLY HAVE GOTTEN -- I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE THE DTI PROGRAM YOU'RE TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL. DENNIS PROVIDING PREVENTIVE DENTAL SRVICES TO AT LEAST AT TEN CHILDREN AGES ONE TO TWENTY INCREASED BY A I'M 7% FROM -- TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN I KNOW SOME OF THE THE DATA THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT EARLIER IN THE AND WAS SORT OF LOOKING AT SMALLER CHUNKS SO WE ARE SEEING INCREASES -- WE WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THAT AND ARE VERY I KNOW CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EACH YES TO BUILD THOSE NUMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME AGAIN FOR US AGAIN UNIVERSITY PACIFIC SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY OBVIOUSLY SUPPORT THE VIRTUAL DEL HOME TECHNICAL FIX BUT ALSO. JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT SERVER DIAMINE FLOORED WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE IS BEING USED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY NOW. AND OVERWHELMINGLY DENNIS REPORTING WHEN YOU PERCENT THE ISSUE TO A PARENT OF YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR CHILD EITHER IF THEY ON CRAWFORD HELD DOWN GET INJECTIONS THE REALLY FRIGHTENING FOR ABOUT A DENTAL CARE AND FUTURE OR EVEN WORSE HAVE TO GO UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA WITH THE RISK OF BRAIN. DAMAGE OVERWHELMINGLY PARENTS ARE CHOOSING THE STF AND THE SMALL BOX POLITICS IS PRETTY MINOR THING COMPARED TO SOME OF THOSE OTHER CONSEQUENCES. OKAY THANK YOU ONLY SEE ABOUT I THINK WILL ALSO APPLY IN VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME. TO OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- IT'S ONE OTHER QUESTION BEFORE YOU WRAP THIS UP SO WE HEARD FROM C. PAN ABOUT. TRY CHALLENGES LANGUAGE ACCESS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WELL HOW WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE TWELVE UTILIZATION ARE GET THE RIGHT UTILIZATION I THINK IS A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY TO SAY IT -- BUT WE LOOKED INTO FOR EXAMPLE HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO HOW MUCH OF A BARRIER LANGUAGE ACCESS MAY BE BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE STATE. AND PEOPLE SPEAKING WRESTLING WITH THAT THAT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER IF PEOPLE ARE HAVING LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND WE'RE NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH EFFORT. EFFORT. TO THAT THERE'S POPULATION WE HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCESS TO OUR SO IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES FOR ALL BENEFICIARIES AND SO WE DO GET ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS -- ACROSS. ELEVEN MOBILE MORE THAN ELEVEN LANGUAGES BUT MORE BUT MOST ARE IN. ELEVEN LANGUAGES SO WE DO WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT BUT CERTAINLY TO THE DEGREE THERE'S MORE THINGS WE CAN BE LOOKING OUR HAPPY TO DO THAT. OKAY A SAID I I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF VALUATION IT'S BEEN DONE LOOKING AT EVERY DISPROPORTIONATELY -- THE FOLKS WHO ARE. HILL WHO ENGLISH IS A PRIME LANGUAGE OR NOT UTILIZING SO I I THINK SERVE GETTING SOME DATA THE LOOK AT YOU KNOW IS THERE ARE WE DOING EVENLY ACROSS THE BORDER. IF THAT'S THEIR Và LOT LOWER THAN THE BORING THAN THIS OKAY WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE WE CAN TRY. TO PUSH IN OTHER WAYS. BUT YEAH THOSE ARE GREAT SUGGESTIONS AND WE CAN LOOK INTO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ASK FOR AND AND GIVE A BETTER RESPONSE BUT THANK YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU APPRECIATE ANY FOLLOW UP ON THAT THEN OKAY. RIGHT NOW THE OKAY NOTHING ELSE LET'S MOVE ON TO MEDI CAL PHARMACY SERVICES. AND I KNOW THAT SIR. THURSTON WOULD HAVE SOME GREAT INSIGHTS BUT HE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE HIS PRIORITIES -- FAMILY -- NEED TO TEND TO SO -- I'LL TRY TO DO AS WELL AS I CAN THE COVER FOR HIM AS WELL ON PHARMACY ISSUES. THANK YOU AND OKAY AND BEGAN. SO -- AS JUST AS YOU KNOW -- THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE IN JANUARY ONE OF THE FIRST IF NOT THE FIRST THING THAT HE DID HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER -- AROUND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS -- PRICE SCENE AND OBVIOUSLY EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THOSE PRICES AND THE COSTS THAT WERE BEING BORN BY. CONSUMERS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS PURCHASERS ANOTHER BIG PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE ALL AND SO AS A COMPONENT OF THAT -- EXECUTIVE ORDER WE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- HAVE TO KIND OF DISTINCT EFFORTS -- WITH EMBEDDED IN THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER ONE WAS THE REMOVAL OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS THERE WITH -- FROM ALL OF THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM EFFECTIVE JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON WHICH I CAN SPEAK TO IN JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DETAIL IN A MINUTE. AND THEN THE SECOND -- PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLED FOR US TO NOT ONLY WORK WITH THE GS AS THEY LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR BOOK PURCHASE SCENE -- EFFORTS IN THE STATE BECAUSE WERE PART OF THEIR DRUG -- COLLABORATIVE. BUT ALSO. CHALLENGING US IS A DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH OTHER PURCHASERS IN THE STATE AND PAYERS TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW WE CAN CHANGE -- THE OVERALL COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR THE GOVERNOR. AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S BEYOND JUST THE STATE -- PROGRAM -- IN THAT WE AS MEDI CAL HAVE -- VERY CONCRETE FEDERAL AND STATE STATUTE AROUND WHAT WE CAN DO AS A MEDICAID PROGRAM THE PRICING THAT WERE ALLOWED TO RECEIVE AS A AS A COMPONENT OF OUR UNIQUE STATUS. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE AS A STATE -- NEGOTIATE AND RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE -- PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS TODAY AS WELL AS THE MANDATORY RIVER REBATES THAT WERE SET IN PLACE NOT ONLY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT BUT ENHANCE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO I THINK -- IN ALL OF THAT -- WE CONTINUE -- TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS AS A STATE PROGRAM ACROSS BOTH MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICETODAY -- OBVIOUSLY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS LOOKING -- TO AGGREGATE THAT PURCHASE SEEN OUT -- F. TWO DISTINCT YOU KNOW AREAS IN TERMS OF WE ONLY GET THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ON THAT FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION AND INSTEAD RETURN ALL OF THOSE -- LIVES INTO FEE FOR SERVICE SUCH THAT WERE NEGOTIATING RECEIVING SUPPLEMENT A REBATES FOR THE ENTIRE THRTEEN MILLION -- MEMBER PROGRAM -- BUT OBVIOUSLY REBATES OR NOT THE GOING TO CHANGE THE UNDERLYING COST OF THE DRUGS SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE OTHER ADDITIONAL THINKING AND RECOMMENDATIONS CERTAINLY COME AND FOR FOR PURPOSES OF THE BROADER EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUESTS -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE CAR ABOUT -- SPECIFICALLY -- WE HAVE SEVERAL REASONS FOR DOING THIS NOT JUST FOR THE REBATES AND FOR THE AGGREGATION OF THE PURCHASING POWER. BUT AS WE LOOK TO THE RENEWAL OF OUR WAIVERS AND TO THE CONTINUED KIND OF EVOLUTION OF OUR PROGRAM -- THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE MANAGED CARE BENEFIT ACROSS THE VARIOUS MODELS ACROSS THE COUNTIES -- ACROSS PLAN TO PLAN WE HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT NOT JUST FOR PHARMACY BUT FOR A LOT OF OTHER BENEFITS -- BENEFICIARIES DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY THAT THEY LIVE AND HAVE DIFFERENT -- ACCESS TO DIFFERENT SERVICES AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND SO THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT IS ONE THAT WE THINK IS BOTH -- IMPORTANT BUT ALSO IN RETURNING IT TO FEE FOR SERVICE -- THE CONTRACTING PHARMACIES THAT WE HAVE IN FEE FOR SERVICE -- REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 97% OF THE PHARMACIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- INDIVIDUALS WILL NO LONGER -- HAVE CHANGES IF THEY CHANGE FROM EITHER COUNTIES OR DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLAN ASSIGNMENTS FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE WOULD BE -- OBVIOUSLY JUST MANAGING THAT PHARMACY BENEFIT ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT. CHALLENGE WHICH I THINK IS IN SOME CASES ARE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET -- AROUND PURSE TIONS IN MANAGED CARE WHEN PEOPLE. CHANGE AND ROLE IN PLANS AND SO -- THE CAR ABOUT -- WILL CONSIST OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- ACTIVITIES RELATING -- TO THE REMOVAL OF THE COSTS -- FROM THE RATES AND THE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY LOOKING -- TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING DATA THAT WE GIVE TO THE PLAN SO RIGHT NOW IT'S INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING -- DRUGS THAT ARE CARVED OUT OF THE MANAGED CARE BENEFIT FOR EXAMPLE -- A LOT OF THE ANTI PSYCHOTICS AND BLOOD FACTOR ARE NOT PAID FOR BY THE PLANS TODAY WE DO PROVIDE THAT DATA BACK TO THE PLANS -- THE PLANTS HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH US ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND INDICATED THAT THE DATA DOESN'T COME TO THEM. IN A MANNER THAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE TIMELY WE WOULD AGREE AND SO A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW UP. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THAT DATA SUCH AS THE PLANS WOULD HAVE THE FULL -- PICTURE OF A INDIVIDUALS PRESCRIPTION HISTORY SUCH THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO A LOT OF THE CARE MANAGEMENT -- AND CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES THAT WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR SO -- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY -- TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BUT IN AND AND QUICK SNAPSHOT THOSE ARE THE DISTINCT ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING [inaudible] OKAY -- I THINK WITH SOME OTHER QUESTIONS SO -- IN TERMS OF I THINK HE DID SORT OF ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT MANAGED CARE PLANS ABILITY TO ACCESS OR MANAGE THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AND DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT. THAT I MEAN IT'S EASY TO DISCOVER SAID OF WHAT THREE FORTY B. -- REALLY IS SO WE HAVE HAD. A COUPLE OF YEARS OF ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITIES -- IN THAT -- WHEN A THREE FORTY B. AND TO T. BILLS THE FEE FOR SERVICE -- PROGRAM TODAY THEY BILL ACQUISITION COSTS AND REIMBURSE ACQUISITION COST PLUS THE DISPENSING FEE. AND MANAGE CARE THERE'S A DIFFERENT. PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REIMBURSING THOSE THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES -- AN AMOUNT -- THAT MAY OR MAY NOT -- THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT AND NO BECAUSE THE THREE FORTY BE DISCOUNTS AND PRICING IN THAT THE ENTITIES THEMSELVES NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE MANUFACTURERS IS NOT KNOWN TO US -- SO WE HAVE HAD ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW DO WE KIND OF BOTH UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENTIAL BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THE STATE ARE NOT PAYING. MORE FOR DRUGS THAN WE OTHERWISE SHOULD BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE PAYING. A PRICE THAT IS NOT A THREE FORTY BE PRICE THEY THEN TURN THOSE COSTS BACK TO US AS A STATE SO THERE'S A CONCERN AROUND. PAIN -- FOR PAIN FOR COSTS THAT OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF THEY WERE IN A FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE CARVE OUT FOR THE PHARMACY BENEFIT WE HAVE INDICATED AND OPENNESS AND WILLINGNESS -- TO UNDERSTANDS THE REVENUES THAT THE THREE FORTY BEENTITIES RECEIVED TO DATE -- DUE TO THESE -- ARRANGEMENTS WITH MANAGED CARE -- WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SEE -- WHERE THOSE COSTS ARE AND WHAT THOSE REVENUES ARE BEING USED FOR IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES OR PROVISION OF OTHER BENEFITS WHICH WE HAVE HEARD ANECDOTALLY BUT CERTAINLY REMAIN? OPEN TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT THOSE LOOK LIKE AND THEN AS THE STATE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE AND WHEN I SAY STATE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE. YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE -- TO UNDERSTAND IF THOSE REVENUES NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE SAFETY NET -- THAT'S A POLICY DECISION THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW. BEEN GOING TO THOSE ENTITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES -- WE THE STATE HAVE MADE A DECISION THAT WE COLLECTIVELY WANT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THAT -- IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE ON THE CAR ABOUT AND SO WE REMAIN OPEN TO THAT DISCUSSION BUT TO DATE HAVE NOT SEEN SEEN THE DATA OKAY. OF OUR FOLLOW UP ON THAT. AND THEN -- THE SERVICE CORPS OF THE SPECIMEN ON THE SAVINGS TO MEDI CAL PROGRAM FROM THIS BENEFIT TRANSITION YES THE WILL BE RELEASING THAT WITH THE MAY REVISION OKAY SO NO ANSWER AT THE MOMENT AND I'LL ANSWER THERE IS SAVINGS ESTIMATE BUT JUST NOT TELLING YOU WHAT IT. AND THE QUESTION WAS ARE WE RELEASING IT AS PART OF THE MAY YES YES THE ANSWER IS YES ALL RIGHT. I CAN BE PATIENT. A LITTLE WHILE. I DOES NOT THAT MUCH LONGER AND THEN. OKAY RIGHT WHAT COMES FROM LA -- FIRST. BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA SO -- WE RECENTLY RELEASED REPORT ANALYZING THE CARVE OUT OF PHARMACY SERVICES AND MEDI CAL -- WHERE WE FIND THAT -- WE'RE WE AGREE REALLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE CAR ABOUT IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN THAT SAVINGS FOR THE STATE -- AND POTENTIALLY IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS WAS NOTED IN THE IN THE GALLEY OR IN THE BUDGET -- WE EAGERLY AWAIT THE THE THE FISCAL ESTIMATE AS WELL WE THINK THAT A LOT MUCH OF THE SAVINGS COULD COME IN THE FORM OF THAT TRANSFER OF SAVINGS FROM THREE FORTY BE -- COVERED ENTITIES OVER TO THE STATE THROUGH -- THE STATE ULTIMATELY PURCHASING THOSE DRUGS AT AT LOWER COSTS -- THE OTHER SAVINGS ARE LIKELY TO COME -- FROM JUST THE TRANSITION OF SPENDING FROM MANAGED CARE PLANS TO THE STATE OBVIOUSLY FOR THE ACTUAL DRUG BENEFIT WE WOULD BEAR THOSE COSTS AND SO THERE'D BE OFFSETTING COSTS. BUT A PORTION OF THAT TRIP -- THAT TRANSFER OVER TO THE STATE -- COULD BE IN SAVINGS THAT THROUGH LESSER ADMINISTRATIVE AND MAY I SAY PROFIT ACCESS. FUNDING -- FOR FOR THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ULTIMATELY WITH THE THE CARD THAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE MADE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WE AGREE THAT THE STANDARD OF THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE BENEFIT COULD BE BENEFICIAL -- FOR FOR BENEFICIARIES. MANAGED CARE PLANS BEAU WOULD WOULD RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUNDING GOING FORWARD -- INCLUDING POTENTIALLY ON THERE FOR THE TIME FOR THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND SO FORTH -- THREE FORTY BE ENTITIES WHAT POTENTIALLY LOSE -- SOME OF THE NET REVENUES THAT THEY AREN'T CURRENTLY ON ON THE THREE FORTY BE SIGNED AND SO -- WE DEFINITELY THINK WE I THINK WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT -- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE -- OF THIS THE TRANSFER OF THOSE SAVINGS RESULTS IN SORT OF HARM TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS PRO -- TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL COVERED ENTITIES AND THAT THAT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED -- THAT YOU KNOW A SPECIFIC STATE POLICY CAN BE CRAFTED TO TWO INCH -- THEIR CONTINUED VIABILITY -- AND THEN -- WHAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THEN ON THE OTHER END MAJOR IMPACT ON DRUG MANUFACTURERS -- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ASSERTED THAT IT DOES HAVE UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO UNDER CURRENT STATE LAW TO AFFECT THE CARVE OUT -- AND WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT -- WITH THAT ASSESSMENT HOWEVER WE DO STILL THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE SIGNIFICANT AUTHORITY -- TO AND AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO BOTH WHETHER AND HOW THIS CARVE OUT PROCEEDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS -- THAT THE COVER WILL ULTIMATELY REQUIRED NEW STATE RESOURCES -- FOR DH YES -- TO CONDUCT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REVIEWS -- AND TO DO A VARIETY OF OTHER ACTIVITIES TO THE ULTIMATELY SEND THE INFORMATION -- FROM THE STATE TO MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE CONTINUED COULD CARE COORDINATION AT THE MANAGEDCARE PLAN LEVEL AND SO THE STATE CAN'T THE LEGISLATURE REALLY CAN PROVIDE -- STRONG OVERSIGHT -- AND REALLY BEEN PUT INTO WHETHER AND HOW THAT CARVE OUT PROCEEDS TROUGH ITS APPROVAL OR REJECTION OF THE STATE RESOURCES. THERE IS A THERE IS MUCH INFORMATION THAT IS MISSING ON ULTIMATELY HOW THIS CARVE OUT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND IT'S LIKELY IMPACTS -- AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONDITION APPROVAL OF ANY FUTURE RESOURCES REQUEST BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON DH CS PROVIDING THIS KEY INFORMATION THIS INCLUDES THAT -- THAT FISCAL ESTIMATE. AS WELL AS A PLAN TO UPGRADE THE STATE'S IT INFRASTRUCTURE SO AS TO PROVIDE MORE TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE DRUG UTILIZATION OF MANAGED CARE MEMBERS. WOULD LIKE TO SEE PERSPECTIVE GUIDANCE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTINUED ROLE IN REALLY OVERSEEING THAT BENEFIT FOR THEIR BENEFICIARIES SINCE THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT ROLE -- CONTINUE KERR WITH -- LET'S SEE IF THEY'RE ANY CONTINUED -- CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE SO THAT -- MANAGE CARE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOW SUBJECT TO A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW -- FOR MILITARY OR CONTRACT ARE PREFERRED DRUG LIST -- CAN STILL ACCESS DRUGS THAT THEY FOUND BENEFICIAL GOING FORWARD. AND THEN -- ALSO ANALYSIS OF OF FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO TO THIS PURSUIT SO WE DO IN OUR REPORT PROVIDE CERTAIN ALTERNATIVES -- BUT AND ULTIMATELY HERE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THOSE OR OTHER ASPECTS OF THE INITIATIVE. I DO HAVE QUESTIONS WITH FINANCING ENDING ALL RIGHT. SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING CAREFULLY TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO. WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY? SO WE HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR WE'RE GOING AGAIN ESTIMATES FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION. NINETY THOUSAND SURF KIND OF ANTICIPATED REPOSE BUT ALSO WAY HEARD YOU SAY WAS OF MOST OF THAT WAS GOING TO COME FROM ESSENTIALLY SHUTTING DOWN THREE FORTY BE. I'M NOT NOTS FROM ACTUALLY SAVINGS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TECHTV SPECIALLY SAID THAT. NOT REALLY GOING TO SAY MY FIVE SOON AFTER ACTORS BUT ASTHE MONEY'S COMING FROM CLOSING THREE FORTY B. WHICH IS NOT WHAT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HEARD THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE DISSIPATING THEY WERE THINKING THAT. STATE WAS GOING TO USE OUR PURCHASING LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE DRUGS OUT LOWER PRICE AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE SAVINGS TO COME FROM. WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW MUCH SAVINGS THE STATE CAN GET FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES. ARE IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS CURRENTLY NEGOTIATE REBATES WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER FOR THOSE STRUT THEIR DRUGS TO BE PLACED ON THE FORMULARIES. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THOSE REBATES DID INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF MANAGE CARE REBATES WITHIN THE MEDICAID OUT WITHIN MEDICAID PER PER GRAMS NATIONWIDE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENT OF THOSE REBATES. ULTIMATELY WHATEVER THE STATE DOES RECEIVE IN SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES -- THROUGH SORT OF THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM -- THOSE SAVINGS WOULD BE OFFSET AGAINST -- ANY SAVINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PASSED ON TO THE STATE THROUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS -- REBATES WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS ULTIMATELY WE REALLY DON'T KNOW THE NET IMPACT BUT WOULD LOOK WE LOOK FOR TO EVALUATING THAT WHEN WE DO SEE THE FISCAL ESTIMATE SO. NOTE NOT THERE'S NOT CERTAINTY HERE AT ALL I MEAN THERE THERE WOULDN'T BE ONCE WE SEE A FISCAL ESTIMATE BUT WE SHOULD WE DO HOPE FOR A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ONCE THAT DOES COME OUT. THE ESTIMATE WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW WHAT WHERE THE COMPONENTS OF THE SAVINGS ARE COMING FROM. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. IT IS SO I'VE MET BUNCH ALARM BELLS ARE GOING OFF RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THEY MOST OF IT IS COMING FROM THAT GIVE YOU. OKAY. RIGHT WELL I MY CONCERN ITSELF FIRST OF ALL I MEAN WE CAN. WE CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT DEBATE ABOUT THREE FORTY BE IN. YOU KNOW IS. IS A WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT. NO ENTITIES ARE USING THESE MEN AND YES AT SOMEWHAT ANECDOTAL. AND I WAS THAT AGE RIGHT BUT THEY'RE USING THEM TO PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES MAYBE THERE'S A DESIRE FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY OF EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THAT MONEY -- BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT I SEE THOUGH IN THE END IS IS THAT WE'RE STRIPPING THAT MONEY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES THE CLINICS PLANNED PARENTHOOD OTHER PEOPLE WHO GET THREE FORTY B.. THEN WE GOT A GET THAT MONEY BACK TO THEM IN SOME WAY TOO RIGHT TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THEY WERE PAYING FOR UNLESS WE JUST WANT TAKE WITH THE SERVICES AS WELL -- SO THAT ESSENTIALLY IS NOT A SAVINGS -- IT'S IT DID IT IS BETTER TO TRANSFER SO OKAY FINDER NOT GETTING IT THIS WAY WE HAD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER WAY UNLESS WE ACTUALLY SAY WE DON'T WANT TO SERVICES ANYMORE. MY GUESS IS THE TYPE OF SERVICES THEY'RE PROVIDING -- ARE PROBABLY ONES THAT. WE'LL HEAR FROM PEOPLE SAYING NO THEY NEED TO HAVE THOSE SERVICES I A I I I I I DON'T SEE THIS GROUPS BASICALLY TAKING MONEY AND TO STICK IN YOUR POCKET AND WALKING AWAY WITH IT I THINK THEY'RE USING IT. TO PROVIDE OTHER PEOPLE SERVE WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THE VALUE OF IT IS AND SO FORTH. BUT IT'S LIMITING THREE FORTY BP'S. WITH THAT MONEY ESSENTIALLY SPRITE GOING BACK AND SOME OTHER MECHANISM. TWO PEOPLE FOR STUFF I DON'T. THE SERVICES IT'S NOT GOING TO IT. I I DON'T SEE THAT LIKE -- WELL NOW WE HAVE SOME NEW MONEY. THE INSTITUTE IT THOUGH I THINK THAT'S TO TO MY COMMENTS EARLIER THAT SAYS. CERTAINLY THAT TRANSPARENCY OF THOSE REVENUES AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES ARE DOING TO SUPPORT THE SAFETY NET TODAY IS THE DIALOGUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE NEED TO HAVE WHICH IS ARE THE SERVICES THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE NEED TO BE PROVIDED AND IF SO. THEN THERE'S A AN APPROPRIATION IN A FUNDING MECHANISM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEN AS A AS A DEPARTMENT IS WE DON'T KNOW EITHER IT RIGHT IT'S IT'S ANECDOTAL AND SO WE REMAIN OPEN TO SEEING WHAT THAT DATA IS AND WHAT THOSE SERVICES ARE WITH THOSE REVENUES. BEING GENERATED AND OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE A A JOINT DECISION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE SERVICE. AND AND MAYBE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT I THINK THERE IS THAT A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAINTY HERE THAN THERE WAS IN UNDER LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL TO REALLY ELIMINATE THE USE OF THREE FORTY B.. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT SAY THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT FEE FOR SERVICE PAYS AND WHAT MANAGED CARE PLANS CURRENTLY PAY FOR A GIVEN THREE FORTY B. DRUG -- WHEREAS I THINK THAT THE SORT OF AND SO HOW MUCH OF A HIT SAY AT THREE FORTY BE COVERED ENTITY IS TAKING IS UNCERTAIN AT LEAST AT THIS POINT UNTIL WE SEE A FISCAL ESTIMATE -- SO THERE COULD IT IT IT JUST IS THERE IS THERE JUST IS UNCERTAINTY HERE AS TO ITS ULTIMATE MAGNITUDE AND I REMEMBER DISCUSSION CORRECTLY LAST YEAR THE PROBLEM WAS THAT YES THE STATE SAVES MONEY. BUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE GETS TAKEN AWAY SO THE MATH MINUS THE STATE SAVES IS ACTUALLY LESS ABOUT HALF. OF WHAT THE ENTITIES ESSENTIALLY. ADD SO WHICH MEANS OF THAT ACTUALLY WE'VE JUST. CHOPPED IN HALF THAT WE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE. TO TAKE THE STOCK QUOTE SAVINGS WE GOT AND FINALLY THE CHANNEL BACK WE'VE GOT TO FIND MORE EVEN MORE MONEY. OTHERWISE IT'S STILL A CUTS. THE YEAH THE ONLY THING I MIGHT. ADD TO THAT IS -- THE IF TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DID THAT REINVEST THIS THE SAVINGS THAT WE DID GET WE WOULD ALSO GET THE FEDERAL MATCH THERE AS WELL SO IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW DOUBLE THE YOU KNOW THAT WHATEVER WE SAID THE SAVINGS THAT WE GOT AND WE SAY. EXPANDED COVERAGE OR PROVIDED A TARGETED RATE INCREASE WHERE WE FIND AN ACCESS ISSUE WE WOULD ALSO BE SORT OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL FUNDS THERE AS WELL -- DATA YOU SAID THAT -- LET'S SAY -- THE ADMINISTRATION MAY FEEL IT'S THEY CAN DO THIS WITHOUT. MUCH. BUT AS THE AYE AYES CERTAINLY TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY INVOLVED IN THIS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE -- VERY. AT THAT EIGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IS DONE WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT APPROVAL. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE CONSEQUENCES THAT I'M HEARING RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF HIGH. WHAT THIS IS THE SITE? AND CERTAINLY LOOK FOR THE ESTIMATE BUT THIS IS ANY WHAT PEOPLE WERE THINKING WHEN WE HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE. OUR PURCHASING POWER TO LOWER OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING PEOPLE AND WHILE PEOPLE SAID WELL WHAT'S GONNA HAVE A THREE FORTY BEATER NOT THINKING LIKE WELL THAT'S FOR MRS SAVINGS ARE GOING TO BE COMING FROM IT AT ALL SUPPOSED TO COME FROM. MAGGOTS ARE PURCHASING POWER -- AND ACTED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL SO WHAT OUR FORMULARY HAVING A LEVERAGE THAT BUT OUR HEARING LIKE WELL NOT SO MUCH WE'LL FIND ON THE ESTIMATE. BUT I THINK -- THERE'S AND CERTAINLY THINK CERTAINLY I'VE HER HEARD FROM ME MY COLLEAGUES I THINK TO BE SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. IF THE THIS BASICALLY ESSENTIALLY BECOMES A PROPOSAL PRIMARILY TO ELIMINATE THREE FORTY BE. I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE TREMENDOUS CONCERN. WE LOOK FOR THIS SORT OF ANALYZING THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE FISCAL ESTIMATE TO SEE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THREE FORTY B. IS REALLY A SORT OF PRIMARY GENERATOR OF THE SAVINGS -- VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER SORT OF TRANSFERS OF I OR SOME OF THE OTHER SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY SO STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY HERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS ANY COMMENT ABOUT THAT -- TOO THE AND THEN I THANK YOU APPRECIATE THERE'S CONVERSATIONS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ABOUT -- A MEDIC YO BUT DON'T LET AND I RELATED TO TALK WITH VALUE BASED PURCHASING BUT OBVIOUSLY -- MEDICATION TREATMENT IS SERVE A COMPONENT IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN AND SO THE WAY WE CALL CARVE IT OUT AND IS A SEPARATE THING IN TERMS OF FOR DOING VALLEY'S PURCHASING ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS. WE GOT THINK ABOUT HOW THAT ALL KIND OF COMES BACK TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S FOR APPLE SOMETIMES WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY TO IMPROVE -- QUALITY AND REDUCE COSTS IS ACTUALLY. TO INCREASE MEDICATION. ADHERENCE AND THEREFORE UTILIZATION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDICATIONS FRAMPOL ASTHMA TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE ON CONTROLLER MEDICATIONS SO FORTH AND AND BUT THAT SAVINGS COMES FROM REDUCTION AND UTILIZATION THINGS LIKE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SO FORTH SELF MEDICATIONS CARVED OUT. HOW DOES THAT WORK RIGHT BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE [inaudible] THAT. THAT THAT ART OF THE FUNDING IS SEPARATED FROM. THE OTHER PIECE AND SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU GET THE VALUE OUT HOW DO YOU PROVIDE INCENTIVE IS THIS IS THE -- AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE FROM THE MEDICATION SIDE WELL GEE YOU DON'T PUSH UP YOUR PUSHING EXPENSE ON TO THEM MEDICATION SIDE WELL THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA HELP US DECREASE. SO HOW THOSE THINGS COME TOGETHER AS OUR AS WE TRY TO PROMOTE. NOT A VALUE BASED PURCHASING BUT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES OKAY. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO ALL RIGHT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM POSTED. OKAY ACTUALLY ALL RIGHT WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS AND WE HAVE TO HAVE COUPLE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS WILL HERE. SEVERAL COATS GO AHEAD AND TAKE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM FOR THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS. OKAY WELCOME. THANK YOU A DAY NUGENT I AM THE P. I. FOR THE HEARSE OF HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTER NETWORK. AND I FIRST OF ALL WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE DH CS.

BUT IN ADDITION I'D LIKE TO TAKE TEN SECONDS TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK SENATOR PAN -- FOR IDENTIFIED THAT THREE FORTY B. IS HELPING PATIENTS IN THE STATE. AND UNLIKE THE DHS HOSPITALS HAEMOPHILIA DOES HAVE AN HM DESIGNATION AND THE RECENT WHITE PAPER FEDERAL WHITE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT.

THANK YOU WE WILL BE HEARING STAKEHOLDER RIPPLES ON HIM THE RATTLE THAT AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES -- AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS SO I'VE JUST FIRST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE ABSOLUTELY. AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND TRYING TO LOWER DRUG COSTS AND SO MY COMMENTS I WANTED TO JUST FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM IN THE SAFETY NET. PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR HEALTH CENTERS THREE FORTY BE A SAVINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT AND I TOTALLY I HEARD THE CONVERSATION HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND I APPRECIATE DR PANTS COMMENTS ABOUT. ARE ALL THE SAVINGS GOING TO BE CAPTURED ON THE BACKS OF THE SAFETY NET I DON'T THINK THAT IS THE INTENT -- AND SO -- WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A A BROAD SURVEY PROCESS WITH OUR MEMBERS TO GET A HOLD OF THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT ARE CAPTURED TO THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND SPECIFIC -- PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVICES THAT ARE USED. TO BUT THAT THREE FORTY BE SAVINGS ARE USED TO FIND AND WHILE I WAS SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION I DID ASK ONE HEALTH CENTER TO QUICKLY GIVE ME SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY THEY USE THAT THEIR HEALTH CENTER THINGS LIKE OF DEFINE THEIR IN HOUSE PHARMACY. TO PAY FOR INDIGENT AND EDUCATOR SUPPORT CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT -- AND I I I HEAR THE DEPARTMENT ASKING FOR THAT DATA WHICH IS WHY WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT SURVEY PROCESS -- WE HOPE TO HAVE IT WRAPPED UP -- NEXT WEEK AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO THE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAFETY NET IS PROTECTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE HAVE ABOUT -- ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY HOSPITALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE PARTICIPATING THREE FORTY B. SO THAT IS SO THAT IS THE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOWER OVERALL DRUG PRICES. BUT THE SAVINGS ON TO THE STATE AS YOU WELL ARTICULATED SENATOR THIS SAVINGS -- MOST OF THOSE WILL COME FROM THREE FORTY BE PROVIDERS SO I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT ON OUR SAFETY NET PROVIDERS BECAUSE THERE WILL BE AN IMPACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. NEARLY HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CESSATION ALSO WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE THREE FORTY BE PROPOSAL I WOULD JUST ADD ONE NEW ONES. AND IT'S RIGHT NOW HOSPITALS AND OTHER COVERED ENTITIES ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE ALL INTO THREE FORTY B. OR ALL OUT OF THREE FORTY VIEW CAN'T BE AN ON COMMERCIAL AN OUT ON MEDI CAL. FEE FOR SERVICE BILLING FOR THREE FORTY B. IS MUCH MORE BURDENSOME FOR THE PROVIDERS THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE THE SAVINGS THEY GET ON THE MEDICAL SIDE AND INCREASE THE BURDEN TO ACTUALLY BILL FOR THOSE DRUGS. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER IF THIS PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD THAT WE ALLOW COVERED ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO OPT IN COMMERCIAL AND OUT ON MEDI CAL SO THEY DON'T ACTUALLY INCREASE. IN THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WHILE LOSING THEIR SAVINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER ALLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- IN YOU KNOW CAPS APPLAUDS THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT -- TO ADDRESS THE RISING COST OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION -- THE SKYROCKETING DRUG PRICES HAVE BEEN A MAJOR IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE OVERALL IN THE EXPENSE OF THAT. SOME ARE MEMBER PLANTS WERE EVER TO HAVE QUESTIONS AND GET SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT THAT HEALTH PLANS ABILITY TO MANAGE CARE FOR THEIR ENROLLEES -- WE'VE YOU THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AS MORE THAN JUST PURCHASING DRUGS ON HEALTH PLANS UTILIZED PRESCRIPTION DATA.

WELCOME HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MICHELLE COVERED IT UP WITH SCA YOU CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO RE LOOK AT HOW WE DO OUR PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING ACROSS THE STATE -- WE THINK THAT A MEDI CAL IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THREE FORTY B. AS FUNDING AND IF APPROPRIATE TO BACK FILL OR REINVEST THOSE SAVINGS T MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD THE SAFETY. NET HARMLESS -- FOR GOOD SERVICES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MATCH EVEN BETTER SO WE ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVIEW OF THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE. GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON BOTH SIDES THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO CONTROL COSTS AND WOULD LIKE DIE THERE'S TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS AND BE ENROLLEES WHO NEED DRUGS NOT ON THE SO. ON THE LIST SO ANY. MOVE TO STANDARDIZE OR RESTRICT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SHOULD CONSIDER THAT MEDI CAL COVER SOME OF THE THE SICKEST INDIVIDUALS AND SO THERE SHOULD BE A ROBUST PROCESS. TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY TRUCKS THANKS. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANKS FOR MUCH ALRIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON WE HAVE TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS -- RELATE TO THIS SO WE FOR THE FIRST ONE IS ACTUALLY ON HIM LIBRA WHICH WE DID HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE PHARMACY SERVICES OVERVIEW.

THANK YOU -- FOR ONE MEETING UP SORRY MISTY JOHNSON WITH OF NIELSEN MARK SUMMER HERE ON BEHALF OF SYMANTEC THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH US EARLIER THIS YEAR. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF DAYS HOURS IF YOU WILL TALKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT HIM LEVER AND THE POTENTIAL FOR CAR ABOUT SO THAT PATIENTS COULD ACCESS. MEDICATION LATE LAST WEEK WE LEARNED THROUGH SOME OF OUR MANAGED CARE PARTNERS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN ACTION ON THAT AND WE WELCOME THAT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM ON IMPLEMENTATION SO THAT THESE PATIENTS CAN ACCESS THIS MEDICATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY COMES FROM PARKER CENTER AND I WOULD JUST SAY WE IT WILL BE A CARVED OUT RETROACTIVELY TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO THE DATE SO THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY ISSUES WE DID. WE DID END UP UNDERSTANDING SORT OF EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT THE SAME AS BLOOD FACTOR IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH IN THE IN THAT SORT OF GENRE THAT THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW HAVE FOUND TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HAVE AN FEE FOR SERVICE SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT AND CERTAINLY WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU GUYS. THANK YOU LA -- COMMENTS FINANCE. SO JUST TO CLARIFY DO EAT BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE NEED THAT ANYMORE. OKAY THAT'S OKAY SWUNG CLARIFY THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE SEE WE DON'T. THE AGENCY ACTUALLY CAN ACT FASTER THAN WE CAN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THERE YOU GO. I LIKE IT WHEN YOU DO IT WITHOUT WAITING FOR US ALL RIGHT. OKAY. NEXT WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR A CARVE OUT. OF HIGH CUTS STROKES FROM POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT FROM CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MERE MARTIN TODAY AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION -- WE'RE DOING KIND OF A NEW WANTS TO ASK RELATED TO HOW HOSPITALS ARE REIMBURSED FOR HIGH COST DRUGS WHEN THEY ADMINISTER THEM ON AN INPATIENT BASIS TO MEDI CA PATIENTS. THAT ARE REIMBURSED A FEE FOR SERVICE. THE VERY NARROW -- AND WORD DEFINING HIGH COST DRUGS IN THE LANGUAGE AS MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. THE CURRENTLY WHEN A FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL PATIENT IS ADMINISTERED A PRESCRIPTION DRUG ON AN INPATIENT BASIS THE HOSPITAL'S REIMBURSE AS PART OF A D. R. G. WHICH IS A BUNDLED AVERAGE PAYMENT TO TREAT THAT PATIENT INCLUDING EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE DRUG -- BUT WHEN THERE'S A NEW HIGH COST DRUG ON THE MARKET THAT'S NOT BEEN PART OF THE STANDARD OF CARE OFTEN THE DRG PAYMENT WILL NOT CAPTURE THAT COST AND PARTICULARLY WON'T CAPTURE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. OR IF THE DRUG IS TRADITIONALLY ADMINISTERED OUTPATIENT AND ONLY SOMETIMES IS THE PATIENT HOSPITALIZED AND THEN IT'S PETER DEAR G. THE DEAR G. WILL NOT CAPTURE THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONSIDERING IT PART OF THE IN PATIENT CARE. SO IN THOSE CASES THE LOSS TO THE HOSPITAL CAN BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL WE HAD A TRUCK LAST YEAR CAMERA OUT FOR LEUKEMIA. THE LOSS OF THE HOSPITAL WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY TIME THEY ADMINISTER THIS AND THE PATIENT WAS HOSPITALIZED IF THEY WERE A MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS. JUST MOSTLY WHO ARE HOSPITAL SEE -- WE DID REACH OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND BY EARLY THIS YEAR THEY AGREED TO CARVE THAT DRUG OUT OF OUT OF THE DRG SYSTEM AND REIMBURSE IT BASED ON ITS COST. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOSPITALS WERE MADE WHOLE AND NOT AND PENALIZED FOR OFFERING THE DRUG. SO WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO HERE IS BASICALLY CODIFY THAT PRACTICE FIND THE RIGHT TARGET FOR ON FOR THESE REALLY HIGH COST DRUGS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE HOSPITAL IS MADE WHOLE WHEN THEY ADMINISTER THOSE DRUGS ON AN INPATIENT BASIS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OKAY ELIO. FINANCE. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- I KNOW OF ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER OF THE US TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS. OKAY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT SO -- WILL BE WAITING WITH BATED BREATH. AND THE ESTIMATES SINCE HE SAID HAVE TO WAIT. BUT I THINK THAT -- NO THE COLOR. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE THERE'S TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE -- IN TERMS OF HOW WE IMPLEMENT -- THE GOVERNOR'S VISION -- REGARDING SINGLE PURCHASING WHILE I THINK GENERALLY PEOPLE VERY SUPPORTIVE. THE DETAILS MATTER AND AND IN WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING AT WHAT MAY HAPPEN WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTING ME NOT NECESSARY MATCHUPS SO THERE MAY BE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT ALL RIGHT. NEXT ISSUE IS THE CAN OKAY SO I'VE FIVE A SIX FORMALLY SAY FOR ISSUE NUMBER ONE WE'RE HOLDING OPEN THE TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR MEDICAL DENTAL SERVICES ISSUE TO ROLLING OPENED THE STICKER PROPOSALS MAKE. A SOLO. OKAY SO NEXT ISSUE IS THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER FOR MEDI CAL TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT'S COMING DOWN THE LINE. VIEW. SO -- YOU TO ASK FOR A BRIEF UPDATE IS OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU STILL WANT THAT. BEFORE I START TALKING YOU SAID TO BE BRIEF SO YOU KNOW -- BUT SO THERE ARE FOUR I WAS ALLOWED TO DETAILS. THAT THERE ARE THE FOUR MAJOR PROPOSALS THAT WE THINK OF OBVIOUSLY THE FIFTH IS THE ODS WAIVER WE'VE HAD OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT SO I MORE. ONLY BE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF FOR THAT PEOPLE USUALLY ASSOCIATE -- THE FIRST BEING THE GLOBAL PAYMENT PROGRAM SO THAT IS THE PROGRAM WHERE WE MET ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE RE PURPOSING THE DISH FUNDS AND SAFE IN A COUPLE FUNDS TO MOVE AWAY FROM A HOSPITAL BASED AND COST BASED SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO UTILIZE -- PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY CARE FOR THESE POPULATIONS -- AND WE NEED TO DO THAT THROUGH ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT DISH TYPICALLY -- NEEDS TO BE ALLOCATED SO WE HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS IN THE SHIFTING FROM IMPATIENT TO OUT PATIENT AND REDUCED EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION -- WE HAD OUR FIRST INTRO VALUATION THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED SOME OF THAT OBVIOUSLY THOSE IT WAS STILL THE EARLY YEARS OF THAT BUT WE BUT YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S ACCOMPLISHING WHAT. WE HAD DESIRED WHICH WAS REALLY TO PROVIDE -- YOU KNOW WHAT AN ACCESS POINT TWO PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTY CARE FOR THOSE WHO STILL REMAIN UNINSURED IN THE SEATS -- WE HAVE -- PAID OUT ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN AFFECT -- AND AGAIN OBVIOUSLY WE STILL HAVE MORE TO TO COME GIVEN THAT WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF INCH OF OF THE PROGRAM -- THE SECOND PROGRAM IS THE PRIME PROGRAM -- AND I NEVER REMEMBER WHAT PRIME STANDS FOR SO I'M JUST GONNA AND NOT SAY IT. BOB SPITTLE REDESIGN AND ADMITTED AS AN MEDICARE YES AND THERE'S LIKE MISSING LETTERS LETTERS THAT ARE TO CAPITAL I YEAH SO I WE WERE WE WERE STRIVING FOR A A A A GOOD ACTORS AND THEIR SO WE ARE NEARING THE END OF THE FOURTH YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION SO LIKE. WITH A G. P. V. THESE PROGRAMS RUN ON A FISCAL YEAR BASIS EVEN OUR WEAVER'S A CALENDAR YEAR IT GETS CONFUSING -- SO THERE ARE FIFTY TWO HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT PARTICIPATE IN PRIME WE DID HAVE TO HEALTH SYSTEMS DROP OUT BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL'S CLOSED -- MEANT SO WE DO HAVE ALL OF OUR DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS SO ARE COUNTY AND YOU SEE FACILITIES AND NOW ALL EXISTING ARE ALMOST ALL DISTRICT MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS -- PARTICIPATING AS WELL -- THE PROGRAM REALLY ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES A STANDARD SET OF PROJECTS AND METRICS. AND THEN THERE'S A MENU OF ADDITIONAL ONES THAT THAT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CAN CHOOSE AND THEY THEY'RE IN THE OUTPATIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION REALM TARGETED HIGH COST HIGH RISK AND THEN RESOURCE UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY. THAT WHICH SOUNDS SUPER BORING BUT IS SUPER IMPORTANT. AND SO -- ESSENTIALLY THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IS THAT THERE WAS IN THE EARLIER YEARS MORE PAY FOR REPORTING. NOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- OVER PERFORMANCE AND WILL BE GOING PROGRAM -- SO WE HAVE LET'S SEE WE'VE PAID OUR ROADS -- ABOUT ONE POINT. SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TOTAL FUNDS SO I DIDN'T WRITE DOWN MY MY FEDERAL FUNDS IT'S LOTS LOTS OF FEDERAL FUNDS. LIKE THREE THREE BILLION FEDERAL FUNDS. AND THEN I AM. AND WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS INDUSTRY TO MUNICIPAL HOSPITALS -- OUR OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR -- HAS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE PRIME TEAMS AND WE ARE HOSTING TO IN PERSON COLLABORATIVE CONFERENCES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE DO THIS EVERY MAY AND ONE COMING UP IN OCTOBER AND THIS IS WHERE. THEY CAN DO PEER TO PEER LEARNING IN AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES -- SO WE'LL HAVE BE HAVING THAT COMING UP BUT THE THIRD IS THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE THAT WE BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON EARLIER -- THAT HAS FOUR CATEGORIES -- INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TIED TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES UTILIZATION THE TEN PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT -- THE ESSENTIALLY A PILOT TING TYPE PROCESS FOR THE CARRIES RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL THAT IS NOW IN TWENTY NINE COUNTIES WE ACTUALLY ALSO HAVE A HUGE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO HAVE NO REGISTERED FOR THAT IT WAS. WE ONLY HAD TWO HUNDRED TEN PROVIDERS IN DECEMBER AND WE NOW HAVE OVER. ELEVEN HUNDRED PARTICIPATING SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. AND THE THIRD WAS THE CONTINUITY OF CARE ESSENTIALLY A INCENTIVE PAYMENTS SO. IF YOU CONTINUE TO SEE THE SAME CHILD A YEAR AFTER YOU WOULD BE YOU WOULD BE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT HAS NOW EXPANDED TO THIRTY SIX COUNTIES WERE THAT IS. THAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR FORCE WAS -- WE SOLICITED LOCAL DENTAL PILOT PROGRAMS WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THIRTEEN THAT HAVE BEEN FULLY EXCUTED -- WE'VE WE'VE SPENT ABOUT EIGHT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR ON THAT IT WAS A SLOWER START GIVING SOME OF THE LONGER TIME FRAME -- BECAUSE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND GETTING CONTRACTS SIGNED AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. AND THE FINAL ONE IS THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT PROGRAM -- WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE PILOT SWITCHER IN -- TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES AND ONE CITY -- WE AS OF SEPT THE SEPTEMBER DIETZ. AT SEPTEMBER QUARTER HAD EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM WE ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT BECAUSE WE'RE FINALIZING THE DECEMBER DATA NOW THAT WE WILL BE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE -- AND SO YOU KNOW WE SPENT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OF THE DOLLAR SO WE ARE -- BEHIND I WOULD SAY IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT IS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN FEDERAL FUNDS. AND WE'VE SPENT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE PILOT PROGRAMS THEY ARE RAMPING UP A LOT MORE IT WAS IT TOOK ALL IT DID TAKE SOME TIME BUT WE WERE WORKING WITH THEM ON ROLLING OVER MONEY SO THAT. WE'RE NOT LEAVING THAT MONEY ON THE TABLE BUT THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TO SPEND AT ALL BY THE END OF THE FIFTH YEAR SO. WE SHOULD SEE A BIG INCREASE IN SPENDING -- BY THAT BY THE END OF OF THE PROGRAM AND I YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IT'S IT'S DOING. PRETTY AMAZING THINGS AND REALLY HELPING PEOPLE'S LIVES CHANGE -- SO JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT AND I ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS THE CAN TO PEER LA COUNTY PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT PROGRAM BEFORE. SO -- FOR PARTICULAR POPULATIONS -- WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY HOMELESS ARE VERY ISOLATED THEY ARE ASSIGNED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO TALKS THEM PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY TAKES THEM TO THE GROCERY STORE HELPS THEM? GET COULD GET. CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITY IF THEIR FAMILY IS SOMETHING THEY COULD BE SAFELY RECONNECTED WITH SAFELY RECONNECT THEM. AND SO REALLY IS THAT THINGS ARE CHANGING CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS ALSO WITH GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING STUFF THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF TENDENCY SUPPORT OF THAT FIRST FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT SECURITY UPON THE KIND. OF THINGS AND THEN SOME OF OUR COUNTIES OBVIOUSLY ALSO DO PROVIDE DIRECT HOUSING SUPPORT -- WITH THE NON FEDERAL MONEY THAT IS IN THE PROGRAM SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE DO THIS. ON A STATEWIDE BASIS -- AFTER THIS WAIVER IS OVER AND REALLY JUST INCORPORATING THESE TYPES OF SERVICES INTO OUR BROADER MEDI CAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU LA ECHO COMMENTS FINANCE [inaudible] SO. SO IN TERMS OF THESE WAIVERS AND THEN THIS WAIVER AND ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS YOU'RE DOING RIGHT AND SOME OF THEM AS YOU INDICATED TAKE SOME TIME TO WRAP THINGS UP SO WE GOT THE WAIVER. IT TAKES SOME TIME TO RAMP IT UP -- WHEN THE WAIVER EXPIRES -- AT HOW MUCH DATA HAVE ABOUT CELLS YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THIS WE SPENT THIS MUCH WE DID IT-CETERA. AND THEN OF COURSE I SOON WILL BE APPLYING FOR ANOTHER WAIVER WHAT CROSS OUR FINGERS AND SEE WHAT CNN AS RIGHT AND WASHINGTON IS A LITTLE INTERESTING RIGHT NOW. AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME ANXIETY ABOUT THAT TOO BUT IT'S TERM. I MEAN WE'LL SEE BY THE TIME THE WAIVERS OVER. WELL YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DATA FOR THAT LAST YEAR YET BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL DOING AT RATE. YOU'D SELL THE LATEST DATA WOULD HAVE PERHAPS IS THE YEAR BEFORE. I I GUESS I'M TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CAPTURE LIKE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WAIVER RIGHT AND AND AND AND AND AND HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK AT LEAST TO BE PART OF THE PURPOSE OF OF THESE PROGRAMS IS THE SAY WELL WHAT WORKED WHAT. DIDN'T WORK WHAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH -- WHAT WE PITCH TO CMS THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE RIGHT -- I MEAN IT SO I GUESS IT WILL MAYBE ALL OF THEM BUT BUT I MEAN IT'S HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO SAY LOOK WE'VE GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION TO SHOW THAT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE SO. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT ROLLING OUT AND HOW AND HOW DO YOU SEE REPORTING OUT TO YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THE? RESULTS ARE LIKE QUITE. BEYOND THEY'LL HAVE SOME GREAT CASE STORIES AND SO FORTH BUT EXACTLY WHAT. WHAT HAPPENED? SURE SO WE DO HAVE --IN MOST OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE MID MID EVALUATION OR HOWARD SO WE'VE DONE SOME OF THOSE. I THINK WE HAVE ONE COMING UP FROM ONE I'M SORRY I DON'T REMEMBER THEM OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WE ALSO DO QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REPORTS ON THE WAIVER TO SEE A MASS -- AND SO WE ARE ESSENTIALLY COMBING THROUGH THAT INFORMATION AND LOOKING AT THE OTHER DATA THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW EVEN IF THE EVALUATION ISN'T DONE YET. AS A BASIS FOR HAVING THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE THINK WILL STAR IN THE FALL OF WHAT THINGS WORKED AND SO HOW DO WE THEN I THINK THE POINT YOU'VE MADE A LOT LIKE HAVE IT NOT TO BE PILOTS ANYMORE BUT REALLY HOW DO WE IF SOMETHING'S WORKING HOW DO. WE MAKE IT INTO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AS A WHOLE JUST CLARIFY I MEAN THAT. SOME PEOPLE SAY RIGHT WE I SUBMIT REPORTS. TO THOSE REPORTS ARE JUST LIKE WHAT WE SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY AND WE DELIVERED EX NUMBER SERVICES SO FORTH I MEAN THAT'S BEEN A WE HAVE ACTUAL. VALUATION. SO I THINK WHAT THEY MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS. THAT BIT OF A A BROADER TIMELINE ON THE VALUATION THE KIND OF RESULTS YES WE'RE GOING TO YET I MEAN THE ON THE OUR REPORTING WE SPENT. HOWEVER MUCH MONEY OBVIOUSLY IS BUDGET COMMITTEE AND CARE ABOUT MONEY A LOT. BUT ALSO I'M THINKING ABOUT THE EMIGRATE AND AND ALSO RECOGNIZE FOR EXAMPLE OKAY SO THE WAIVERS. DONE WE HOPE THAT IT WILL CONTINUES ON THESE PROGRAMS CONTINUE IN A FUTURE WAIVER BUT IS OR HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO. YOU KNOW THE DEAD OR CAPTURED A LAST YEAR RIGHT AND DEPENDING HOW LONG IT TOOK TO RAMP UP AND SO AND BY WE WILL HAVE TO RAMP UP. YEAH WE WANT YOU DON'T DOES NOT THINK THINGS SO HAPPEN ONLY ONE YEAR BUT THE OF MAY TAKE A FEW YEARS BEFORE YOU SEE THE IMPACT. IS THERE'RE SOME SORT OF PLANNED FOR EVALUATION TO OR YOU KNOW TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE CONCLUSION OF THIS WAIVER NOW OF THE THIRD LACKEY WEEKS WE'RE STILL CONTINUE THE PROGRAM BUT EVEN THE PROGRAM FOR SOME REASON WAS NO LONGER FUNDED DUMMIES OR SOME. WAY TO LOOK AT WHAT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT WAY FOR ALL OF THE PROGRAMS ALSO REQUIRE FINAL EVALUATIONS THAT LOOK ACROSS THE FIVE YEARS SO. OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T GET THAT WAS DONE UNTIL AFTER THE PRO RIGHTS OVER BUT YES IT WAS WITH THE WINDOWS EXPECT TO HAPPEN AND BY THE FINAL EVALUATIONS LIKE A YEAR LATER TWO YEARS LATER. I WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU IT IS MORE THAN A YEAR LATER. I GET -- KNOW IF IT'S EXACTLY A YEAR LATER FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER -- WITH THERE'S PARTICULAR TIME FRAME SO I'D HAVE BUT I'LL I'LL FOLLOW UP BY JUST ON OKAY YES TO BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT THE THE FINAL AND ALSO YOU SAID THE MID TERMS. YEAH I LIKE HAVE SOME OF THOSE THAT WE CAN SHARE RIGHT AT THE END AND AND THE ONES YOU DON'T HAVE YET WHEN YOU EXPECT TO GET. I THINK THAT BE HELPFUL BECAUSE IT WILL BE VERY. I WAS AROUND WHEN YOU SAID YOU'RE PROPOSING IS WAIVERS AND SO OKAY GOT A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS OF PRIDE AT SOME OTHER ONES TOO BUT THE OF INTERESTING THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND BE GOOD TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS ARE THAT. THAT THOSE ARE SO THANK YOU. IS LA ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE LOOKING AT THE VALUATION MAYBE COMPILE SOME REPORTS ABOUT THE THE THE WAIVER. RESULTS I THINK IT'S MORE WORK WHEN YOU'RE NEAR. WE CERTAINLY ARE TRACKING THE EVALUATIONS AS THEY COME OUT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT AT THOSE REPORTS AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED. OKAY WELL I YEAH I THINK IT'S SINCE YOU GUYS WORK FOR US. THE I I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE. TO TRY TO DRAW OUT WATER LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE THIS WAIVER SO THAT WAS WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICY MOVING FORWARD AND IS IS I'D. WATCH WE LOOK FOR IN THE NEXT WEBER OBVIOUSLY IT'S TIME THAT WE DECIDE BY ADMINISTRATION BUT THEN ALSO FOR THE ONES THAT CMS MAY OF DECLINED TO FUNDER FUND DIE LOWER SCALE. TO WHAT DEGREE MIGHT WE WANT TO BE THE PUT IN STATE RESOURCES ARE NOT PUT IN STATE RESOURCES TO CONTINUE SOME OF THE WORK. DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SUCCESS AND WHAT SCALE THAT WE NEED TO DO IT AT TO STILL. BE ABLE TO GET THE RESULTS SO. RATES OF ED PRECIADO AREAS AND PUT INTO THAT.

THE THE DTI IS THE THE FIRST FORAY INTO VALUE BASED PAYMENT IN THE FOR SERVICE DENTISTRY AND WE HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING THAT MOMENTUM WHEN THE LIVE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER EXPIRES. INDICATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT THEY BOB DUE TO THEIR NEW RULES WILL WILL NOT. APPROVE A A DENTAL COMPONENT -- FOR AT ANY NEXT ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER AND SO WE ARE. VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN START THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW ABOUT CONTINUING THE BEST PRACTICES A THREE STATE PLAN AUTHORITY -- IT IS SO THAT THERE IS NOT STOPPING AND STARTING WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL ON THE FINAL EVALUATION IN ORDER TO THEN SAY THESE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES THAT CAME OUT OF THE TI AND THEN.

GOOD AFTERNOON RENTAL COMING HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE JUST LOVE A LINE IN ECHO MY COMMENTS WITH AT THE AYE YOU MY COLLEAGUE MICHELLE CABRERA.

NO MY BOTTOM A CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AS AN ORGANIZATION WORKING IN THE COUNTY THAT HAS THESE PROGRAMS WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS OF HEALTH ACCESS ANY OTHER ADVOCATES OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU RUN TESTIFYING AT JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION SO IN TERMS OF WELL THIS WAIVER SO WHEN WHEN THIS PLANNING START FOR THE NEXT ONE WE HEARD FOR THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION THAT THEY'LL THAT. THE NEW GUIDELINES MEANS SO BUT WHAT POINT DO WE SAY WE'RE SORRY THE NEXT ONE AND GETTING SOME INFORMATION AS TO WHAT YOU LOOK. WERE YOU EXPECTING TO PUT IN -- NOT OR WORSE THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT YOU FEEL THAT WILL PROBABLY IN GIVEN THE CURRENT FEDERAL GUIDELINES MAY UNFORTUNATELY NOT BE ABLE TO BE PUT INTO A WAIVER OBVIOUSLY CMS STORE. YEAH SO -- WE HAVE STARTED OUR INTERNAL PROCESS -- GZ COOPER WHO IS MY SENIOR ADVISER HER DAUGHTER KENNEDY WAS HERE EARLIER. THEY HAD TO LEAVE THAT SHE HAS BEEN REALLY SHE'S GOING TO BE OUR LEAD PERSON IN TERMS OF ORGANIZING THIS PROCESS AND IT REALLY IS SOME OF THE STUFF I TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT ME THE LAST TIME I TO THE FUTURE OF MEDIC HOW. THREE OF CONCEPTS THAT REALLY IS FOR STARTING WITH NOT JUST THIS WAIVER BUT THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN MENTAL HEALTH WAIVER THAT'S EXPIRING. AND SO WE'RE REALLY DOING THAT INTERNAL PROCESS RIGHT NOW -- AND THEN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND SO PROBABLY LIKE LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL IS WHEN WE WILL START TO HAVE A MORE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE ARE CERTAINLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH THOSE WHO ARE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED JUST TO SERVE HAVE THOSE EARLY CONVERSATION SO CERTAINLY -- THE DENTAL COMPONENT WILL BE ONE OF THOSE -- I THINK PROBABLY JUST A CLEAR FIVE REALLY WHAT PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ME SAY IT WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT. I HAVE BUT WHAT. OUR BELIEF IS THAT WE THERE IS NOT A POSSIBILITY FOR LARGE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE RULES THAT CMS IS PUT IN PLACE FOR THE BUDGET NEUTRALITY COMPONENT -- BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUR INTENTION IS TO NOT CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING SO ON THE DENTAL SIDE WE WILL WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT -- THERE ARE OTHER AUTHORITIES JUST LIKE THERE'S OTHER AUTHORITIES WE COULD USE FOR OR ANY OF THESE OTHER COMPONENTS SO THAT IS REALLY THE CURRENT WORK WE'RE DOING THE ANALYSIS ON WHAT AUTHORITIES. CAN WE USE AND AND YOU KNOW I WOULD ALSO SAY THERE SO -- BENEFIT TO USING A LESS SUBJECTIVE AUTHORITY -- AND NOT THE AUTHORITY THAT THEY'RE DOING WORK REQUIREMENTS THROUGH SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S IT'S PART OF THAT CALCULUS WHAT I ACT ACTUALLY THINK MATHEMATICALLY WE'RE NOT. GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE FOR THE PAST THREE THREE WAIVER CYCLES BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME PROGRAMS. THEY MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT WE CAN DO THEM UNDER OTHER AUTHORITY SO WILL HAVE DEFINITELY MUCH MORE CONVERSATION IT USER LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL WITH -- SORT OF EVERYONE WHO'S INTERESTED WHICH IS EVERYBODY SO. HELLO PLANET AND I'M INTERESTED I KNOW I HAD THAT I WAS INCLUDING YOU [inaudible] YOUR OFFICE. OKAY. ALRIGHT SO THE AND SO I JUST WANT YES SENSE OF WHAT OUR TIME LINE IS AN WATER EXPECTS. SO IT'S IT'S THAT LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL TO START THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A PLAN A SO WE WOULD HAVE. GENERALLY THE WHAT WERE THINKING THAT WE CAN SHARE AT THAT TIME IN IT SOME OF IT IS COMING OUT OF THE CARE COORDINATION GROUP THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR. THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL IN IN SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM -- SO YEAH SO WE'LL HAVE SOME STUFF COMING OUT THEN AND THEN HAVE A LOT OF ROBUST CONVERSATIONS LIKE WE ALWAYS DO. IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL GOING TO LOOK LIKE -- AGAIN I THINK IT WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A LARGE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WE WILL WE WILL STILL NEED SOME ELEVEN FIFTEEN AUTHORITY FOR SEA BASS FOR EXAMPLE AND TO THE ODS WEAVER BUT THOSE -- ANGIE PP BUT THOSE ALL AREN'T DON'T HAVE BUDGET NEUTRALITY ISSUES IT'S THE OTHER THINGS I HAVE A HOUSING TRIAL THE ISSUE SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT A MAYBE NINETEEN FIFTEEN B. HEALTH AUTHORITIES ARE STATE PLANT ORTIZ TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. I LOOK FOR TO YOU EDUCATING ME ON THESE THINGS. ALL RIGHT OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE HOUSING SERVICES. SURE SO -- THE GOVERNOR AND HIS JANUARY BUDGET WAS IS PROPOSING A ONE TIME ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION THAT WOULD BE GOING TO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT ROGRAMS. TO SUPPORT HOUSING SERVICES SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE LIKE LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM HOUSING COULD BE RENTAL SUBSIDIES AS WELL AS CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND BUILDINGS YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY BUILDING HOUSING PROJECTS -- THE IT IS NOT MATCH THIS IS WHY WE CAN DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT WITH WITH FEDERAL MONEY. WE DID RELEASE WAS IT JUST EARLIER THIS WEEK YES LAST WEEK YOU PUT IT IN YOUR AGENDA SO YOU HAD AT SOME POINT -- THE THE PROPOSED ALLOCATION ACROSS THE ACROSS ALL OF THE PILOTS -- MAY WAS A MIXTURE OF BUT YOU KNOW THE POINT TIME HOMELESSNESS THE MEN'S YOU KNOW MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE FAIR MARKET. RENT -- EFFICIENCY AMOUNT SO IT WAS IT WAS BASED ON SORT OF A COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS -- SO OUR INTENTION IS THAT THAT MONEY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO EACH OF THOSE PILOTS. THE CABBIE OUGHT WE HAVE IS THAT IF A PILOT IS NOT CURRENTLY PERFORMING -- WE'VE HAD FIVE PILOTS BEEN BE UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO STILL ARE -- SO WE WOULD NOT BE PROVIDING THE MONEY UNTIL THOSE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED. THANK YOU ARE COMING TO MILLION -- BEN JOHNSON ALEJO WE PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE HOUSING SERVICES EARLIER THIS -- THAT THIS YEAR WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS AND THAT -- THAT WERE LARGELY ANSWERED BY THE DEPARTMENT THE ONLY ONES THAT -- WE STILL HAVE OUTSTANDING ARE HOW THIS FUNDING WOULD ULTIMATELY RELATE TO SORT OF FORTHCOMING MONEY THROUGH NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND SO FORTH TO BETTER COORDINATE -- THE VARIOUS SORT OF POTS OF FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENTS OKAY. YEAH I THINK WHEN THE A BECAUSE I PREACH IN WE HAVE TREMENDOUS NEEDS AROUND ADDRESSING HOUSING THOUSAND DOES THAT WE HAVE THE PART HERE POP THEIR POT THERE AND SO HOW RECORD. HOW ARE YOU BE SURE THAT THE? WHAT'S ARE ALL WORKING WITH EACH OTHER NOT AGAINST EACH OTHER OKAY -- PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AGAIN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- FOR SOME STATE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A WHOLE PERSON CARE AND THE HOUSING SIDE OF IT -- BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING ALL OF OUR SERVICES TO BEAR AND USING A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND OTHER THINGS TO MAKE ALL PERSON CARE WORK BUT IT'S THE HOUSE IS THE MISSING PIECE WHICH WE HEAR ACROSS ALL OF OUR ISSUES. AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE WELCOME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL BUT ALL OF WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND FOR THE METHODOLOGY THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER. INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS INSTEAD OF HOME WITH. MATH GENERALLY AS PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION -- IN ADDITION THERE'S THERE'S A QUESTION WHETHER OR THE FUNDING GOES TO THE COUNTY OR THE LEAD ENTITY. A REGARDLESS WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A CONNECTION WITH HOUSING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES INCLUDES THE INCLUDING HOUSING NAVIGATION IN TENNESSEE SUPPORT EITHER THROUGH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT OR HEALTH HOMES PROGRAM. TO ENSURE OF EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE FUNDS THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME MICHELLE CAM DATA WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA WE ALSO ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND AGREE WITH YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK HOLISTICALLY AS WELL IF POSSIBLE -- THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AS AND JUST SORT OF ALREADY HIT IT'S DEEPENING AND CONTINUING WE ARE LOSING HOUSING SUPPLY -- CONSTANTLY BECAUSE PROPERTY VALUES ARE SO HIGH AND WE DON'T REIMBURSABLE -- FOLKS AT ADEQUATELY TO KEEP LOW INCOME FOLKS -- HOUSE AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME THAT AFTERNOON SIR HAS GETS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN MY COMMENTS ARE ARE BOTH REPRESENTING SEE PAGE AS WELL AS THAT OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION GEAC. WE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND WHAT OFFER TWO RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS WITH THE METHODOLOGY ONE WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN THE KERN ELIGIBILITY FOR HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES WHOLE PERSON CARE ALREADY HAS A DEFINED. ELIGIBLE POPULATION AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS ALREADY CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY LOCALLY. AND THEN THE SECOND WOULD BE TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN DETERMINING HOW TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE SOME REALLY STRONG LESSONS LEARNED AROUND HOW WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE THINK WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN AND IDENTIFYING. KIND OF HOW TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE ACT REALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME HI MARTY EMOTO FAMILY MEMBER CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOU CAN ACTION NETWORK CALIFORNIA PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY PARTNERSHIPS IS STRONG SUPPORT. FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND ALSO -- ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THANK YOU WELCOME. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THIS AS A PHYSICIAN. I KNOW THAT WHEN I PATIENTS TO HAVE ARE HOMELESS OR HAVE UNSTABLE HOUSING IT'S VERY HARD TO GET SERVICES BECAUSE PRACTICALLY THE FIRST QUESTION YOU GET ASKED WE REQUEST SERVICES THAT WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS. AND THE FACT THAT THE FINES OR YOUR ADDRESS TO FIND OKAY NOW YOU GET SERVICE IN THIS PERSON CONCERNED IS COUNTY OR JUST NEIGHBORHOOD OR WHATEVER ELSE SO -- SO SIDE THEN IN ADDITION OF COURSE HAVING A STABLE POINT AND SO I THINK THIS. IS OFTEN THE MISSING PIECE IN AND SHE MENTIONED THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE PART THAT WE HAVE TO PUT THE MONEY UP FOR BECAUSE WHEN I GET YOU A FEDERAL MATCH WE'RE NOT GETTING IT CETERA CELL. I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PUTTING THIS. FOR ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE PRIVATE HOSPITAL DIRECTED PAYMENT QUALITY INSTEAD OF FOR SURE SO THIS IS A RESOURCE REQUEST -- FOR FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS IN EIGHT A FIVE YEAR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES REALLY FOR US TO IMPLEMENT THESE TWO PROGRAMS -- THE THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT GENERALLY HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY. THE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE BE AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS FROM OUR PUBLIC HOSPITALS -- THIS IS JUST A NEW STRUCTURE ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE MANAGED CARE RULE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATELY MORE COMPLICATED HENCE THE NEED FOR MORE RESOURCES. OKAY COMES MILLENNIAL. FINANCE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS OKAY WELL WE LIKE TO KEEP THEIR QUALITY JERSEY COMING IN SO. HIS PHONE WE NEED PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK ALL RIGHT SO ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER PROGRAMS. SURE SO -- YOUR ASSETS. THEM THAT WE WILL HOLD THE PREVIOUS ITEM SORRY. I SURE SO YOU'D SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON THE ASSISTED LIVING WEAVER. SO WE DID HAVE OUR WEAVER RENEWED EFFECTIVE MARCH FIRST OF THIS YEAR -- IT IS A FIVE YEAR RENEWAL WE DID HAVE WE HAD DONE AN AMENDMENT LAST YEAR AT TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SLOT SO THE WAIVER RENEWAL ALSO INCLUDES THAT SO WE DO HAVE -- THE TOTAL CAPACITY IS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS WE ARE RELEASING THOSE SLOTS AT AT A RATE OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CARE COORDINATION AGENCIES YOU KNOW HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE ASSESSMENTS OF OF THE SERVICES THAT. ARE NEEDED AND JUST AS A REMINDER WE DO HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT AT LEAST 60% OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLING IN THE IN THE PROGRAM ARE ACTUALLY COMING FROM FACILITIES. SO THEY'RE REMOVING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AT THE THE REMAINING ESSENTIALLY PREVENTING THEM FROM BEING -- PUT INTO AN INSTITUTIONAL SITUATION -- WE ARE YOU KNOW IT SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT PHASE EVEN THOUGH THIS WAIVER WAS JUST RENEWED. IT WAS A SORT OF AGAIN PART OF WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE BEFORE HOW DO WE THINK MORE HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IN ALL OF THESE WAIVERS -- AND NOW PEOPLE WHO'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THESE WE HAVE NOW HEARD ME SAY THIS BUT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW RIGHT PURPLE STRIPES. POLKA DOTS YOU GET THIS PROGRAM BUT NOT THAT AN ORANGE I ALWAYS PICK DIFFERENT COLOR SO ORANGE. ORANGE SKIN THAT'S MAYBE NOT A GOOD ONE GREEN SKIN AND A PURPLE STRAIGHT SAY IS ANOTHER AND THAT'S CONFUSING FOR THE BENEFICIARIES IT'S CONFUSING FOR ALL OF YOU AS YOU TRY TO DO OVERSIGHT OVER THESE PROGRAMS AND IT'S ALSO CONFUSING FOR US AS AN ADMINISTRATOR. SO WE WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE THINK MORE HOLISTICALLY ABOUT EIGHT CBS AND NOT. ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL WAIVERS BUT AND AGAIN SIMILAR TO THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE IN THE DENTAL SIDE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR A WHOLE SIDE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE. THINGS MORE STANDARDIZED AND HOW DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS SERVICES SO THAT WILL BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I MENTIONED. THAT WILL BE HAVING LATER THIS YEAR AS WE REALLY CONSIDER WHAT WE WANT THE FUTURE OF ALL THESE WAIVERS TO LOOK LIKE. OKAY IN A NOTRE AND OUR DESCRIPTION WITH SEVEN DIFFERENT WAIVERS. YES EIGHT YES. OKAY FINANCE ALL RIGHT AND WE DO HAVE THREE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED -- TO THESE WAIVERS SO THE FIRST IS -- SEE WE HAVE PROPOSAL FOR CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HERE PERCENT. ON THAT. ONE AND THEN AFTER YOU DO THE STATE CALLED PROPOSAL TO PUBLIC COMMENTS SO IF THREES. THE THREE SIGNALED PROPOSALS RELATED TO THIS [inaudible] OKAY WELCOME. MINOR THREE MINUTES FOR ALL THE TESTIMONY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE ASK QUESTIONS YOU HAVE MORE CHANCES. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN DEBORAH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. MAY I SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED. ALTERNATIVES WAIVER BECAUSE THAT RELATES TO SEE CITY IT IS AN INNER URINALYSIS AS ONE OF THE SEVEN WAIVERS. AND THEN I'LL ASK MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST BAY INNOVATIONS TALK ABOUT CCT. WITH THAT WORK FOR YOU. I'LL BE FAST ON EVEN IF SO AND YOU ALSO CAN MAKE A PUBLIC OUT AND I'M GONNA BE REALLY REALLY FAST WE HAD A WITNESS HERE WHO'S AT THE CONSISTENT CONSTITUENT OF YOUR SYSTEM WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE. WHO HAS BEEN ON THE WAITING LIST FOR THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER HER NAME IS MERRY KERR? SHE HAS SOMETHING CALLED I'LL GET IT WRONG MUSCULAR. SPINAL ATROPHY SHE KELLY IN YOUR OFFICE HAS BEEN HELPING HER SINCE LAST SUMMER SHE APPRECIATES THAT. WE KNOW THAT LAW A WAIVER SLOTS HAVE INCREASED WE DO HAD A VERY ROBUST HEARING IN. THE OTHER HOUSE SO IN AND MAY SIXTH IS A DATE BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE H. C. B. WE WERE WHEN WE VERY MUCH ASK YOU TO CONCUR IN THAT REQUEST OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. LIVVIE CENTERS ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY INNOVATIONS -- REGARDING UP THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS BUDGET REQUEST ON BEHALF OF THE R. C. AND E. B. I. FOR NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. OF STATE GENERAL FUND FUNDING -- TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS WE'VE BEEN. IN THIS KIND OF LIMBO WITH CONTINUED FEDERAL FUNDING -- FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO EXPIRE. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE THEN WOULD HAVE A YEAR TO CONTINUE -- FOLLOW UP BUT NO LONGER BE ABLE TO TRANSITION WE SINCE THEN GOT A THREE MONTH EXTENSION AND A SIX MONTHS AS EXTENSION FROM THE FEDS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS TWO FOLD. IT LEAVES OUR COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS LEAD ORGANIZATIONS IN TURMOIL WE HAVE EMPLOYEES LEAVING THEY CAN'T STAY IF THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB LONGER THAN TWO MONTHS. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WE CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRANSITION WE'VE TRANSITIONED OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD BE STRANDED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. AND THESE ARE COMPLICATED VERY DETAILED TIME INTENSIVE TRANSITIONS THAT WE CANNOT COMPLETE IN THE TIMELINE NECESSARY UNLESS WE HAVE A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR HOPE WE OPTIMISTIC THE FEDS WILL GIVE A LONGER EXTENSION. BUT WE CAN'T JUST KEEP BEING IN THIS LIMBO PHASE THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T GIVE US A LOT OF ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED UNLESS WE HAVE SOME STABLE FUNDING SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THAT STABILITY. AND SHE FORGOT TO SAY THE WAIVER IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY SO THAT'S THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS WE CAN'T JUST RELY ON THE EIGHT CPA WAIVER BECAUSE FOR THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER OR ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE IT. IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WE ARE ABLE TO TRANSITION INDIVIDUALS -- AND SUPPLEMENT EIGHT CB A WAIVER SUPPLEMENT ALE W. WAIVER SUPPLEMENT IHS US BUT WE NEED TO KEEP THE CCC CCT PROGRAM IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MOVE YET. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE EIGHTY S. ALEJO. FINANCE SO IS NOT CLEAR IF I SO THE REQUEST HERE AND SO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THE CCT THE COMMUNITY. THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE TRANSITION SERVICES SO THE REQUEST BECAUSE YOU SAID THERE'S FOR THE VINE HEARING YOU SAY IS THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ON THE FEDERAL SIDE RIGHT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY. CONGRESS DOES WHAT CONGRESS DOES AND WE SOMETIMES DO THAT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SURE WE'D SUPPORT AND WILL KEEP YOU GOING FOR THREE MONTHS AND FIGURED OUT RIGHT AND OF COURSE IN THE MEANTIME YOU'RE LIKE TO HAVE A JOB IN THREE MONTHS ARE NOT. GOING TO ACTUALLY KEEP GOING -- YEAH DON'T WORRY WE KEEP GOING OUT BUT WE NOT SURE RIGHT -- SO WITH THIS MONEY IS HE SAID AUTHORITIES THIS IS TO SAY THAT IN CASE IT DOESN'T THERE WILL I MEAN THIS IS LIKE A BACKUP PROMISES THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE REQUEST IS. SENATOR PENN LAST YEAR WE CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT TO MAKE IT. PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL REQUEST BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WAS SCHEDULED TO END AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND NOW WE ARE HERE BECAUSE EVEN THE WERE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FEDERAL MONEY. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS DISRUPTION IN THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF THE A TIME LAG BETWEEN THE DATE WAS SCHEDULE TO END THE SUBSEQUENT TEMPORARY EXTENSIONS AND THIS DEMONSTRATES THE VITAL REASON. FOR THE STATE PUTTING UP THAT MONEY TO SAY WOW WILL RECEIVE HAS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN CONGRESS. IF THEY CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS PROGRAM STOP AND IT SAVES MONEY. AND THIS THIS IS FOR ONE YEAR -- THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WOULD BE TO ENSHRINE IT IN LAW I'M TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ONE YEAR BUT WE DO HAVE A POLICY BILL SB TWO FOURTEEN DODD. FOR THE SENATE PROGRAM CLARIFIED AND THIS IS A REQUEST FOR ONE YEAR FUNDING. IN THE EVENT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DOESN'T COME THROUGH OUR HOUSING GAP OR SOMETHING SO WE COULD BASICALLY AT LEAST DEAR THAT THAT THE NONPROFITS WHO ARE DOING THIS TO HAVE THEIR EMPLOYEES TO LOOK. YOU KNOW YOU WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A JOB FOR THE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THE MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH THIS WILL BE A FUNDED. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY SO WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUE TO TRANSITION PEOPLE THE PROBLEM IS WE WERE IN A POSITION WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO STOP STOP OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY IT BY ANY FROM TEACHERS RESPECTIVE I MEAN WELL I MEAN I THINK WE ARE WE HAVE COMMITTED AGAIN THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION IN THE ASSEMBLY ON MONDAY. AND SO IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES WE DID ALSO COMMIT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON HELPING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FISCAL RESULT IS IF ALL THE FEDERAL MONEY IS GONE AND IT'S ALL STATE FUNDING. WHAT IS THE SAVINGS IF THERE IS SAVINGS JUST SO THAT THAT CAN BE A PART OF THE DECISION MAKING SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT? OKAY M. TO EXPLAIN THE LOG JAM BECAUSE WE THINK THERE ARE SLOTS AVAILABLE THEY'RE JUST NOT BEING FILLED OKAY AND THERE'S A VERY LONG LIKE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PERSON WAITING LIST. OKAY AND AND THIS IS. IN A SU MOST OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE NURSING HOMES AT THEM TO BE A MEDICAL. SO IN GENERAL YES MOST PEOPLE IN HER SING SILLY IS RIGHT YEAH I THINK IT'S 80% -- IF WE ACTUALLY GOT ABOUT NURSING HOMES ENTER HOMES WOULD SAVE SOME MONEY TO WRITE YES AND THAT IS THE BASIS WHY WE HAVE THESE WEAVERS I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE OF HOW DO YOU DO THAT OR IS THAT. WHAT ARE THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE WE DOING IT APPROPRIATELY SO THAT IS OUR GOAL AS WELL FOR SURE -- AND AGAIN I THINK A YOU KNOW AS AS WE COMMITTED TO COME BACK -- IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS ON SORT OF SOME OF THE PARTICULAR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT PARTICULAR ON CHILDREN OR OTHERS. THAT WE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS BUT YES WE WE ARE A 100% AND ON HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WE JUST. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT THERE'S ALSO UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THERE'S LOTS OF VERY SPECIFIC FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THAT ALSO TAKE TIME THAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD ALL LIKE THINGS. TO MAGICALLY BE EASIER BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS BUT WE THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO IMPROVE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT BUT AT A AT THE ON THE BUDGETARY STANDPOINT SO I UNDERSTAND LIKE OKAY IF THE FED DOESN'T? AT ALL BUT PRICE SOME KIND OF A FINANCIAL I DON'T CARE TO USE RIGHT WORD BUT BUT IT IS BY WAY OF IT TURNS OUT WERE FUNDING IT WE CAN CHANGES WE CAN MAKE THE RULES LAW HE'S HEARD IT'S OUR MONEY. YES. BUT I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT. THIS IS A PROGRAM TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF NURSING HOMES INTO THEIR HOMES. THAT'S SAVING US MONEY. SO WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS IT SAVED US MONEY BUT BECAUSE WE HAD ALL FEDERAL MONEY FOR THEIR PART -- YEAH I THINK THAT'S WHERE DOES THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT WE LOOK AT NINE SO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS IN THE CONTEXT OF IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DESN'T AND WE FIND IT WHAT IT WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE FROM WHAT I TO TERRY. PERSPECTIVE OKAY SO I AM VERY INTERESTED IN YES I NEED AT OUT BECAUSE MY GUESS IS THAT. IT. CERTAINLY THE REQUEST IS FOR NINETEEN POINT. NINETY POINT ONE MILLION BUT THE ACTUAL COSTS TO US. BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT DOING IT. MAY TURN OUT TO BE A LOT MORE MAY TURN OUT TO BE EQUALLY EXPENSIVE. OR EVEN POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE SELF OKAY SO IT'S GREAT THAT YEAH SO IT'S GREAT THE FEDS ARE PROVIDING NOW BUT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T. WE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT OKAY VERY GOOD. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT -- NEXT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL IS THE TO EXPAND CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER FUNDING AND SERVICES WE OF THE SUSPICION OF CALIFORNIA CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS HERE -- WILL COME [inaudible] HI. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- BUDGET YOUR PAN MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M CATHY KELLY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FAMILY CAREGIVER ALLIANCE IN THE BAY AREA. YOUR RESOURCE CENTER SOME SPEAKING TO THE REQUEST FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE CENTER SYSTEM TO SUPPORT -- UNPAID FAMILY CARE GIVERS. FOR A ONE TIME BUDGET INCREASE OF TEN MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS EACH YEAR. TO EXPAND AND RETOOL THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY CARE GIVERS. AND THE COMPLEXITY OF CARE. THAT THEY NEED WE KNOW -- TOO WELL WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE AGING. DEMOGRAPHICS AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OUT. OF DON'T TELL INTO THE KIND OF DIRECTION THAT WERE WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE. THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM AND THAT IS THAT THE FAMILY CARE GIVERS ARE TRENDING YOUNGER THEY'RE MORE DIVERSE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY BE IN THE WORKPLACE THEY HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME -- THEY ARE ALSO PROVIDING ABOUT TWENTY HOURS A WEEK ON AVERAGE OF IN HOME ASSISTANCE -- THERE ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT ARE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE ALTHOUGH WE SERVE ALL INCOME BRACKETS -- THE ONCE A REALLY STOCK OR THE ONES THAT ARE NOT FAR ENOUGH TO QUALIFY. FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE PUBLIC SERVICES NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY FOR PRIVATE SERVICES THIS IS A GREAT MIDDLE THIS IS THE MAJORITY OF FAMILY CARE GIVERS. IN THE STATE. AND THEIR STOCK -- MANY OF THOSE -- CARE GIVERS ALSO AND THIS IS SORT OF EMERGING DATA THAT WE'RE HAVING NOW SO YOU'RE HEARING SOMETHING BRAND NEW FROM NATIONAL. DATA AND ALSO SKIN FROM OUR OWN DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS -- IN SAN FRANCISCO AND AND LOS ANGELES CA OR SEE ON THE SPECIAL -- A RESEARCHER PROJECT THAT WERE UNDERTAKING IS A UPWARDS OF HALF OF ALL CARE GIVERS ARE ACTUALLY CARING FOR VERY COMPLEX CASE. IN A COMPLEX CARE RECIPIENTS. AND THAT IS THAT THERE PERFORMED A MAJORITY OF VOTES OF THESE A DAILY LIVING IN AN INSTRUMENTAL. TO ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND THEY ARE PERFORMING A COMPLEX MEDICAL TO HOUSES TO FIND. AS THE SIXTEEN NURSE DELEGATED MEDICAL TASKS A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED. SO THINK OF IT THIS WAY HALF OF FROM OF CALIFORNIA CARE GIVERS ARE REALLY PROVIDING AN ASSISTED LIVING OR A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. EXPERIENCE FOR ONE IN THEIR OWN HOME. AND THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE SEE THAT ARE THE MOST STRESSED. SO THEY NEED THEY ARE DOING THESE KINDS OF THINGS OF WITHOUT TRAINING GUIDANCE INSURANCE THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS HOUSE CORRECTLY -- AND THEY HAVE GREAT PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL RISKS OF THEMSELVES AS A RESULT. THIS BUDGET. EXCUSE ME THIS BUDGET REQUEST US TWO THINGS. FIRST IT DRAMATICALLY RAMPS UP THE STRUCK SERVICES THE FAMILY CARE GIVERS BY WORKING TOWARDS TRIPLING THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT WE HAVE. CAN'T CARE GIVERS RECEIVE. EXCUSE ME HIGH AND LOW INTENSITY SERVICES -- YOU HAVE THE SPECIFIC -- INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE LEVEL SERVICES UNDER DIFFERENT CATEGORIES -- AS WELL AS RAMPING UP WHAT WE CALLED CONSUMER DIRECTED RESPITE SERVICES TO GIVE A BREAK TO VAN NESS AND GAS WRAP UP OKAY.

NO OTHER. OKAY BUT ALL RIGHT OKAY AND NEXT ITEM IS THE STATE WIDE TRANSITION PLAN EXTENSION. FOR SO -- AS YOU MAY RECALL -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD RELEASED A FINAL SETTINGS RULE RELATED HOME COMING COMMUNITY SETTINGS THAT-- FUNDAMENTALLY REQUIRED A LOT OF CHANGE IN ASSESSMENT -- AND FOR US YOU KNOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS. THE ORIGINAL TRANSITION PERIOD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BY MAY OF THIS YEAR -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID RECOGNIZE THAT FOR MANY STATES BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT MAKE ALL OF THE TRANSITIONS. HAPPEN AND MAKE ALL OF THE SETTINGS COMPLIANCE -- BY THAT TIME WAS NOT POSSIBLE SO THEY HAVE DONE AN EXTENSION AND SO -- THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL THE SAME BUT WE ARE REQUESTING THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXTEND SO LIMITED TERM STAFF IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THAT ADDITIONAL WORK. INCOMES FAMILIAL THIS FINANCE. OKAY -- ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY SEEING NONE. RIGHT CERTAINLY WILL HOLD THAT ITEM -- CONCERNING MAKES LOS SENSE. ALL RIGHT -- I AIMED AT ITS ONE FIFTY RIGHT NOW I WOULD -- GONNA TAKE A TAKE A FIVE MINUTE STRETCH BREAK I COULD USE A STRETCH FRANKLY. SO. AND SO IT SAYS STRETCH FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WE'LL DIVE INTO PROP FIFTY SIX SO ALL RIGHT THANKS [inaudible] FIVE MINUTES SO WE'RE NOW ON ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT SO WE HAVE A SERIES OF ISSUES AROUND PROP FIFTY SIX AND PAYMENT SO -- LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT PROPERTY SIX MEDI CAL PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES. FOR SO IN TERMS OF THE THINGS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THEY ALL ARE NOW IN A FACT -- SOME HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR AWHILE -- THE MOST RECENT ONE I THINK ON THE THE HOME HEALTH IT WENT INTO EFFECT AT THE END OF DECEMBER -- WE ARE STILL LOOKING TO PROCESS THE RETROACTIVE -- ADJUSTMENTS BACK TO JULY -- ONE THAT THAT WILL BE HAPPENING PROBABLY NEXT MONTH -- BUT OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS BEEN GOING GOOD WE HAVE THE FEDERAL APPROVALS ON THE MANAGED CARE SIDE SO THE PHYSICIAN PAYMENTS -- JUST WENT TO THE PLAN SO THOSE SHOULD BE GETTING OUT TO THE POSITIONS AS WELL -- SO IN GENERAL EVERYTHING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR PROPOSALS IS IS IN EFFECT IN AND WORKING -- OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PROPOSAL WILL BE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE FOR THE NEXT YEAR THAT WILL BE -- HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY AND I'M AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE QUESTION ABOUT THE EVALUATION ABSOLUTELY -- WE WE THINK WE NEED TO DO AN EVALUATION THAT IS. LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE AFFECT NOT JUST ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL BUT ON A REGIONAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF ARE WE REALLY SEEING. UTILIZATION INCREASE ARE WE SEEING DIFFERENT PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM I THINK AS AS WE TALK ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I KNOW A CONCERN THAT YOU HAD BEFORE IS THE STOP AND START NATURE THAT WE'VE HAD FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I THINK THAT THAT HAS. HAD AN EFFECT ON SEEING ANY AFFECTS SO WHEN WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE DATA WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN ANY CHANGES OTHER THAN PAYMENTS ARE GOING OUT BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN UTILIZATION OR OR PROVIDER PARTICIPATION WE ARE HOPING THAT. GIVEN THAT. THIS YEAR'S UP. THIS YEAR'S AMOUNTS ARE REALLY CONTINUING NEXT YEAR SO THERE WON'T BE ANY STOPPING IN BETWEEN -- JUST CONTINUE THAT -- HOPEFULLY WHEN WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR WILL HAVE SOME BETTER DATA THAT WILL START TO HOPEFULLY SHOW -- ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY I THINK PROBABLY IS BUT TAKE ANOTHER YEAR. TO HAVE REAL COMPLETE DATA OF AN ON GOING NATURE BUT THAT IS THAT IS CERTAINLY OUR PLAN -- AND WE BECAUSE WE AGREE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS IS DOING WHAT. IT WAS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING OR SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT DOING SOMETHING ELSE. I THANK YOU AYE COMES FROM ALEJO. THANK MISTER CHAIR AROUND WILL THE WITH THE LA -- EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT -- ASSESSING ABOUT THE VARIETY OF PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELATED TO PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX AND WE HAVE COMMENTS ON THOSE SOME OF THEM WILL BE ADDRESSED IN LATER ITEMS ON ON THIS AGENDA BUT WANT TO IN PARTICULAR JUST. MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT IN PARTICULAR THE PHYSICIAN -- PAYMENTS WHICH MAKE UP A VERY LARGE PORTION OF OF THE ALLOCATION -- HERE TO FOUR AND AND IN THE UPCOMING -- THE PROPOSED THAT AMOUNT FOR THIS YEAR -- IN JUST TO START OFF WITH THAT -- ONE TOO NOTE THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- DETERMINED IN THE STATE IS DETERMINED OVER. MANY YEARS TO MOVE A LOT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM INTO THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE STATE MAKES CAPITATED PAYMENTS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRES THEM. TO GUARANTEE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ACCESS AND THAT'S MEASURED THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS IN NETWORK ADEQUATE STANDARDS. AND WHEN MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE -- CHALLENGE -- TO PROVIDE ACCESS CONSISTENT WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS THEY ARE ABLE TO AN OFTEN DO PAY ABOVE -- FEE FOR SERVICE RATES -- AND THEN THE STATE -- SUBSEQUENTLY -- CAN INCREASE THE CAPITATION THAT THEY RECEIVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THOSE FOR THOSE CHANGES SO IN SOME SENSE. THE SYSTEM THAT THE MAJORITY OF THIS CARE IS TAKING PLACE AND IS IT IS SET UP -- TO TO PROVIDE FOR THIS ACCESS TO BE TO BE -- IN PLACE -- THAT ALSO LEADS TO A SITUATION WHERE THE EXISTING PAYMENTS ARE A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT'S ON TOP OF WHATEVER THE MANAGED CARE PLAN IS PAYING IN BECAUSE THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ARE IN THE POSITION OF NEGOTIATING WITH PROVIDERS ABOUT WHAT THOSE RATES COULD BE -- WE DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHAT THE RATES ARE GETTING TO AFTER THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE MADE AND THIS MEANS THAT WE MAY NOT BE TARGETING. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED SINCE MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD ALREADY BE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS -- IN SOME CASES TO TO TRY AND INCREASE THE ACCESS. IN LIGHT OF THAT -- WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL AS A AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS MENTIONED THAT. THIS BE EVALUATED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY -- TO GUARANTEE THE LEVEL OF ACCESS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONCE. AND WE ALSO NOTE THAT AND THERE ARE OTHER. WAYS TO GET AT ENSURING THAT THERE'S ACCESS IN THE PROGRAM A ONE OF THOSE. IS THROUGH COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE AGENDA IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WITH -- REGARD -- TO STRENGTHENING PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS -- AS IT -- FOCUS ON HELPING THEM. ENSURING THE MEASURE PLANS ARE MEETING THEIR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT. TO TO ACCESS [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENTS. EIGHT SO FOR A FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT -- STATE THAT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO SEE RESULTS RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT YOU MAKE THE CHANGE PEOPLE TO KNOW THE CHANGES HAPPENED SO THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. AND THEN TAKE SOME TIME TO MEASURE IT AND THEN REPORTED OUT SO -- I APPRECIATE RECOGNITION OF ACTUALLY HAVING SOME CONSISTENCY SO THAT PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY CONSIDER BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY -- WHAT'S. MATTERS IN TERMS OF ON THE END SO WE WANT MORE PEOPLE WILLING TO ACCEPT MEDI CAL PATIENTS -- I APPRECIATE -- THE ALLEY AS COMMENTS -- AGAIN I GUESS WHAT I SAY IS THAT -- CERTAINLY TIME AND DISTANCE AND WE USE THAT FOR IN IN -- AND OUR COMMERCIAL SIDE AS WELL -- HIDE THIS IT'S A BETTER FOR STILL FAIRLY NARROW WAY OF LOOKING AT AT ACCESS IN THE FACT. I THINK THE STANDARDS ONLY APPLY TO CERTAIN SPECIALTY IS CERTAIN TYPES OF SERVICES SO -- SO I THINK THAT AND ONE WITH A LOOK AT OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAMS I MEAN I I I I I IT IN WHAT WERE YOU HERE. FOR FREQUENTLY BUT I ALSO SEE PEOPLE GETTING BACKED UP TRYING -- TO THOSE WEEDS OUT NO WE CAN BRACE MEDI CAL EXPANSION MEDICAID EXPANSION SO FORTH I KNOW WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE OF OF PEOPLE BUT BE ABLE TO GET IN -- AND WHILE CERTAINLY US SOME MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS VERTICALLY FOR SPECIALTY CARE WHICH HAS BEEN. THOSE PROBLEMATIC. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE -- THERE'S ALSO CHALLENGES SO -- SO IS SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO TO EVALUATE THAT AND ALSO LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE OF THE ACCESS SERVICES WHICH ACTUALLY FRANKLY IS -- THE BIGGER CHALLENGES ON THE SPECIALTY SIDE. NOW RECOGNIZING THE REASON ON THE PRIMARY CARE SIDE WE TEND TO HAVE A LITTLE LESS IS BECAUSE OF OUR FQHCS AND ARE AT AND LOOK LOOK LIKES AND SO FORTH AND IN SOME SENSES -- AND THEY GET FEDERAL SUBSIDIES SO -- SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE LOWEST DISSIPATION RATE OF PRIVATE PRACTICE PEDIATRICIANS. IN OUR MEDICAID PROGRAM OF ANY STATE. SO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT IS THAT A PROBLEM OR NOT WELL YOU KNOW IF WE CAN GET INTO A DIFFERENT ONE RIGHT TO GET TO A CLINIC. BUT ARE A LARGE NUMBER CAN IT THERE IN URBAN AREAS FINE OF CLINICS AROUND BUT THE STAT IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH. FOR MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES OTHER PLACES WHERE PEOPLE MORE DISPERSED AND WHILE THEY'RE CERTAINLY VERY EXCELLENT. COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTERS RURAL HEALTH CENTERS. SOME OF THE MORE CHALLENGING WHEN THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO PHYSICIANS -- ISN'T PARTICIPATING NOW BUT TO MY COMMENT. YEAH THE ONLY THING I MIGHT ADD IS THAT WE DO WE DO REALLY AGREE THAT THERE IS -- WHILE BROADER CONSTELLATION OF ACCESS OR QUALITY MEASURES THAT REALLY MATTER FOR HOW WELL THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS A IS SUCCEEDING AND SO FORTH AND THAT THAT IS WHY WE DO THINK THE APPROACH THAT WE WILL DISCUSS AT THE END OF THE DH CS AGENDA. IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HE THIS MEASURES THAT -- PLANS ARE -- HELD ACCOUNTABLE. TO FULLY UTILIZING THE SURVEYS OF BENEFICIARY SATISFACTION AND SO FORTH AND SO WE REALLY DO -- WE DO REALLY DO THINK THAT THAT LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO A LOT OF THESE OUTCOMES MEASURE DOES HOLD PROMISE IN TERMS OF INCREASING QUALITY AND ACCESS. AND THE SONY SIKORA PROVEN HE THIS IS GREAT -- BUT IT'S THE MYSTERY OF DATA AND IT'S USUALLY ON FAIRLY CALM CONDITIONS SO IF YOU HAVE RARE CONDITIONS THERE'S USUALLY NOT A HE THIS MEASURE BECAUSE IT'S MORE EPISODIC. WE DO CAPS I APPRECIATE THE REMOVING THE CAPS EVERY. YEAR BUT SO FAR WE HAVEN'T DONE VERY WELL ON CAP SO WHAT -- EVERY OTHER YEAR OKAY THIS IS A VERY THREE YEARS EVERY TWO YEARS SO -- BUT FRANKLY YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT COMMERCIAL PLANS STIR GENTLY FOR FIVE STARS IF WE HAVE A THREE STAR MEDI CAL PLAN THAT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY WELL I KNOW WE HAVE SOME CARDS ARE PLANS ARE UP AT FOUR FEIST I APPRECIATE THAT YES AND WE WE NEED TO TAKE. A LOOK AT THIS MEASURES. ALL RIGHT WELL WE DO HAVE -- NUMEROUS -- STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS DO WE HAVE HERE. LET'S SEE 1-234-567-8910 ELEVEN TWELVE OKAY. WE DO HAVE TWELVE SPEAKER A HOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED TO MEDI CAL PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE ARE GOING TO HEAR THEM ALL AND THEN WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS. WHICH MAY END UP BEING JUST TELL ME WHICH OF THE TWELVE YOU REALLY LIKE -- BECAUSE HE ALWAYS STILL GOT A MINUTE -- AND YOU HAVE MORE YOU I TELL ME ABOUT THEM YOU CAN. PROVIDE. SCOTT HERE'S HAPPY TO LISTEN TO YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO. SO MY BUT IN RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO THE FIRST -- ONE IS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROPOSAL DIRECT DTS MINUTE THREE YEAR STATE PLAN AMENDMENT WELCOME. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PHYSICIANS THANK YOU -- PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE COVERAGE AND CARE FOR THE OVER THIRTEEN MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE AL. AND WE ALSO COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S RETURN OF ALL PROPERTY SIX FUNDING TO SUPPORT PROVIDER PAYMENTS. AND THE MAIN CHALLENGE FACING PROVIDERS WHO WANT TO PERMANENTLY SEE AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH MEDI CAL PATIENTS ARE THE DELAYS AN ANNUAL APPROVALS OF THE SUB MODEL PAYMENTS BY CMS AND THE FACT THE FUNDING IS NOT GUARANTEED EACH YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE -- THE TO TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS STATE PLAN AMENDMENT WAS JUST APPROVED BY CMS AND ALMOST A FULL YEAR AFTER THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED PAYMENTS IN THE BUDGET. SO THEME IS SUPPORTING A BUDGET REQUEST DRAFTING DH CS TO SUBMIT A THREE YEAR FEDERAL STATE PLAN AMENDMENT VERSUS A SINGLE -- CURRENT YEAR APPROVAL TO SMOOTH AND MAKE MORE CERTAIN THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REVENUE STREAM SUPPORTING INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FOR DCS OF OBTAINING APPROVAL BY CMS EACH YEAR WILL BE LESSENED GIVING THEM MORE CAPACITY TO MONITOR THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND ENFORCE ACCURATE AND TIMELY DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING. ONCE FEDERAL APPROVAL IS RECEIVED -- WE BELIEVE THE CONTINUED OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE PROGRAM IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE BENEFIT OF PROP FIFTY SIX DOLLARS. CONTINUE TO FLOW FROM MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDERS AS BENEFICIARIES INTENDED. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- ON THE ALLEY -- REPORT -- INTERVIEW AND WE SEE THAT SUPPLEMENT PAYMENT STRUCTURE AS A WAY TO LEAPFROG THE CAREFULLY BALANCED -- CAPITATED RATE ECOSYSTEM AND DIRECTLY -- AFFECT PROVIDER BEHAVIOR -- AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE -- OF MOST OF THE PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL HEAR TODAY ALL -- TWELVE BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PICTURE AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH AN UPDATED LETTER THANK YOU. AND I BROUGHT MY FRIEND FROM CA THANK YOU.

IT IS NOT ACHIEVING THE BEST POSSIBLE USE OF THE FUNDS -- WITH SINGLE YOUR SPOT. ALLOCATIONS THREE YOUR SPOT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE SOME CONTINUITY BUT ALSO ALLOWING FOR EVALUATION TIME IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU.

SO -- IN -- IN PREVIOUS REPORTS WE FASTER -- WE'VE SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER AT LEAST A MULTI YEAR APPROVAL -- BUT THAT IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TERM TO ALLOW FOR THAT PROPER EVALUATION [inaudible] FINANCE.

IT MAKES FISCAL SENSE TO INVEST IN THE HEALTH OF THIS PROGRAM -- THE RESTORATION OF THE 10% CUT TO THE CURRENT PUBLISHED RATE WITH THE ADDITION OF A MODEST OF LOSSES TO AVOID NEW CLOSURES. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM PARK HOSTS WAS OKAY ALEJO [inaudible] FINANCE. AND IS THERE AN SO I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE RESTORATION THE REDUCTION AND 15% BECAUSE LIVING INCREASED IS OR AT AND THAT'S ABOUT WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF THAT WOULD BE. WE DON'T HAVE A CURRENT ESTIMATE BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE I BELIEVE. A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HEALTH -- FOR CREATED AN ESTIMATE AT THAT TIME OF TWENTY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. STATE COSTS -- BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE UPDATED TO CURRENT TIME A HIS ANY CONVERSATIONS OF FINANCE ABOUT GETTING AN UPDATED ESTIMATES YET -- YES AND THEY ARE I BELIEVE AT YOUR DIRECTION PREPARED TO TO THEM BUT WITHOUT THAT -- WE'RE ONE OF MANY MANY PROPOSES THAT NEED AN ESTIMATE CREATED SO -- YEAH WE DON'T WE WE DON'T INDEPENDENTLY HAVE US OKAY OR YOU OKAY SO WE HAVE JUST SO YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THIS. WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF OKAY YEAH ALL RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU THANKS FOR MY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU pDOING. I THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT UP WE HAVE -- THE PROPOSAL TO RECREATE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY CLINICAL LABORATORY SERVICES CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION AND ON THE BETTER CIRCLES THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES NETWORK. OKAY WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHRISTIE FOR A ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE QUESTION LAP CORE THAT OUR MEMBERS. AND WE HAVE A BIT UNIQUE SITUATION WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A RATE INCREASE WE'RE JUST ACTUALLY ASKING THAT ARE MEDI CAL RATE BE LEFT THE SAME. AND NOT BE CUT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO HOW THAT WORKS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CMS HAS MADE THE DECISION TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY CALCULATE. A MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR CLINICAL LABORATORIES SO THEY HAVE CUT ALL OF THE RATES DOWN TO THE NATIONAL MARKET RATE. AND THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE NOW IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S BEEN HERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT SAYS UP OUR MEDICAL RATES CANNOT BE MORE THAN 80% OF THE MEDICARE RATE. AND SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE THESE NEW REDUCE TO MEDICARE RATES FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS IMPACTS WHAT OUR RATES ARE FOR MEDI CAL AND I CAN GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE KINDA HELPS ILLUSTRATE THAT. SO AS A PART OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WE DO CHILDHOOD LEAD BLOOD TESTING. AND SO AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME -- WHEN THEY TESTING ON A LEAD IN THE BLOOD IT'S THE SAME TEST FOR A CHILD AND MEDI CAL AS IT IS FOR AN ADULT IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM? AND SO THE RECENT -- MEDICARE PRICE WAS SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY ONE CENTS THE NEW CALCULATION THAT PUT IT UP MRKET RATE BROUGHT IT DOWN TO TEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS. SO IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWO pTO A MARKET RATE SO THE STATE FORTY COPULATE OUT THE MARKET RATE AND THE CURRENT MARKET RATE FOR THIS TEST. IS TEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE CENTS SO YOU CAN SEE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT MARKET RATE. THE PROBLEM IS WITH THIS NEW PROVISION OUR WEBSITE WITH HIS OLD PROVISION IT WILL CAUSE THAT RATE TO BE CUT 20% DOWN TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FORTY EIGHT CENTS. AND THEN WE STILL HAVE THE AB TO SEVEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE CENTS. SO IF YOU CAN SEE THE CURRENT MEDI CAL RATE IS TEN DOLLARS AND THE NEW RATE WOULD BE UNDER SEVEN DOLLARS SO WE ABSOLUTELY THINK IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON ACCESS. FOR NOT JUST CHILDHOOD BLOOD LEAD TESTING BUT A LOT OF OTHER TESTS. TO SO BASICALLY IN CONCLUSION -- ARE ISSUE WE'RE JUST ASKING. AS A MATTER PRIORITIES THE YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET YOU MAKE DECISIONS NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA REALLY LOOKED AT CLINICAL LABORATORY RATES AND SAID THEY NEED TO BE CUT 30%. IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A FIX TO GET RID OF THAT 80% CAP AND I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THAT. THANK YOU COMMENTS PER HAS RISEN SALLY -- FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY SO. ME NO CURSO IS A OKAY SO I MEAN WHAT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WHERE CERTAINLY I THINK -- I MEAN LOTS A WINDFALL FOR MEDI CAL IF WE JUST SIMPLY LET THIS HAPPEN BUT AND ITS POTENTIAL AXIS ISSUE AN ANSWER. YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE PUT IN A TENT QUOTE 10% CUT BACK IN BUT THIS IS THIS SO IN OTHER WORDS. IS IT FAIR TO JUST TAKE THE WINDFALL AND RISK THE PROBLEMS ARE TOO WE JUST MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT SO THAT I MEAN THEY'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR AN INCREASE OR JUST LOOKING FOR PARITY BEFORE OR SO SURE SO WE WILL NEED TO ASSESS ANY ACCESS POTENTIAL. ACCESS ISSUES BECAUSE AS AS AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS A CURRENT STATE LAW LIMITATION SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. THAT SO THIS WAY -- BUT WITH YOUR HELP -- FOR THIS IS EVEN WITH YOUR ACQUIESCENCE. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY LAWS REQUIRE WHAT WE COULD OVERRIDE THE GOVERNOR'S VETO BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THAT -- IF IF THE LEGISLATURE SO CHOSE TO MAKE A CORRECTION. WE JUST LIKE TO KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION BE OPEN TO THE IDEA AND PERHAPS. THE GOVERNOR SAID. NO YOU CAN'T. IT IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO DO NINETY OKAY AND WE WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM YOU TO VOTERS TO DO THAT. AND THEN A STATE PLAN CHANGED TO REMOVE BECAUSE OF THE STATE LODGE. PROVISION IS IN THE STATE PLAN OKAY ALL RIGHT SO CELL VIEW COULD PROVIDE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR APPROPRIATE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- THOUGH IT OF FACILITATE THIS OCCURRING CORRECT AND WE GOT YES AND SO I KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH SCOTT AND HIS LIST OF THE PRIDE NOT HIS LAST BUT THE LIST OF RIGHT -- KIDS THERE ARE AS YOU'VE NOTED MANY MANY STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS AND SO I THINK BETWEEN US AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE WE CAN'T REALLY DO ALL NINETY I THINK THERE'S NO I I UNDERSTAND THAT I BUT I PLAY I THINK FOR THIS. ONE PARTICULAR I MEAN THIS IS NOT. THE SICKLY IS THAT THIS IS A WINDFALL FOR BACK I I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE DATE WAS BUDGETED FOR THAT OR NOT -- IN THE REGIONAL THAT AND I AND I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A FAIRNESS ANDERSON ACCESS ISSUES THAT SO I'M NOT SURE WE WERE OVER PAYING THEM BEFORE. AND SO BUT WE WOULD NEED YOUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE SURE WE CRAFT THE SOLUTION THE RIGHT WAY. SORRY AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT Y. INCREASE I THINK WE WANT TO TRY TO FOLLOW THE LINES OF WHAT YOU SUGGESTED AND JUST TRY TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE -- METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY CHIEF WHAT THE LABORATORIES -- UP PROPOSED SWITCHES YOU OF BEING SURE THAT THERE'S SOME PARITY WITH PREVIOUS. THAT MAKES SENSE TO SURE WE HAVE THE SAME -- ACCESO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE ABOUT ASSISTANCE FROM FINANCES WELL I'D TELL OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN WE'LL DO OUR PART. OKAY -- DEVELOPED SURVEY SO WE HAVE -- PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE THE RATE FREEZE INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR AYE CFT DIS FOR THE GOVERNMENTAL SERVICES NETWORK AND THE NEXT UP ON THE BETTER CIRCLES CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. RIGHT WELCOME TO PAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS MARK CLAUS FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FOR HOME OF GUIDING HANDS WERE A FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD A COMMUNITY BASED -- PROVIDER NONPROFIT -- IN SAN DIEGO -- I WASN'T HERE TO ELEVEN PM WHEN I WAS AT THE AIRPORT FOR FIFTEEN THIS MORNING SO I I FEEL YOUR PAIN -- BUT YOU KNOW -- WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR IMMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES ICO AND -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR SMALL COMMUNITY BASED HOMES WE OWN AND OPERATE TWENTY FIVE HOMES -- THEY EACH SUPPORT SIX INDIVIDUALS KNOWS HOMES -- GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW THE THE OTHER PROVIDERS ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED HOMES -- I SEE OF HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING I CAN TELL YOU HAVE BEEN AN ABSOLUTE LIFELINE THEY ALLOWED US IN MONEY OTHER PROVIDERS. TO SURVIVE -- WITHOUT THESE FUNDS OUR ORGANIZATION WAS LOOKING AT CLOSING A NUMBER OF THESE HOMES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE OUR RATES WERE FROZEN AT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ARE EXCUSE ME TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT LEVELS -- SO THEY WERE LOOKING AT A RATE FREEZE OF ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE. DURING THIS TIME THE COST OF LIVING INDEX OF IN CALIFORNIA IS INCREASED ABOUT 27% -- WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO DO THE SUPPORT TO UNFREEZE THE RATES -- BUT YOU HAVE TO FOR EARLIER -- FROM OTHER PROVIDERS AND ALSO A PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS. REQUIRED MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES HAVE HAVE LEFT -- US UNABLE TO BE COMPETITIVE IN TERMS OF OUR STAFF IN TERMS OF QUALITY DIRECT CARE STAFF OUR CURRENT TURNOVER RATE IN OUR HOMES IS IN EXCESS OF 40% -- ARE THE MEDICAL COSTS TRYING TO FIND NURSES TO WORK ON OUR OWN -- OUR HOMES HAVE SEVEN NURSES BETWEEN ALL TWENTY FIVE OF THEM. OUR COSTS EXCEED OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO TRY TO FIND GOOD QUALITY NURSING AND MEDICAL STAFF TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS THE COMMUNITY IS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO -- SERVICE -- THIS 15% -- WOULD ALLOW US TO BE COMPETITIVE REDUCE AT STAFF TURNOVER RATE AND CONTINUE THE IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- PECAN ON THESE HOMES FOR MANY MANY YEARS. THANK YOU HI THANK YOU. THE PROPOSAL. BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THIS PROPOSAL -- IN THE ON THE AGENDA TODAY WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECALCULATE THE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE FORMULA SO THIS IS I AM GONNA HOLD SO. WE HAVE GOT TO THAT PROPOSAL YET HAS OUT. TO YOU I THOUGHT YOU ARE ALSO PART OF THIS ONE SO THAT'S OKAY YOU JUST WAIT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES -- A. L. FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY -- ALL RIGHT AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S THE CURRENT -- WHICH I GUESS THAT'S THE FOR FOR THE SEAT DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SO BASED ON THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT HOW MUCH WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET FOR THESE SERVICES. BRENAN TRAMP. ROUGH TO TELL ME YEAH. THE 15% WE WILL I THINK WE PROVIDED A A ROUGH NUMBER -- I KNOW WE'RE WORKING DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON ON SOME MORE CURRENT INFORMATION AND BETTER TENDONS WERE LOOKING AT ACOSTA SOMEWHERE AROUND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS [inaudible] OKAY. HI THAT'S VERY HELPFUL OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY SO THE NEXT ACRE PROPOSAL IS THE RECALCULATION OF PROP. FIFTY FIVE SHOPFOR HOSPITALIZATION AND NEXT PERSON UP IS THE CALIFORNIA BIRTH CENTER ASSOCIATION ON WILL BE AFTER -- HOSPITALS AS IT OKAY WELCOME AND THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THIS TODAY BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECALCULATE PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE MORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROPOSITION AND IN LINE WITH VOTER INTENT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT. IT COULD MEAN AS MUCH AS AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM. WE WOULD PROPOSE THAT THOSE DOLLARS BE SPENT -- ON A ONE TIME BASIS AS INVESTMENTS FIRST OF ALL WE'D LIKE TO SEE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PUT INTO WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THEY COULD BE USED TO FUND -- PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCIES AND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCIES -- AND IF THIS WERE DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW WE THINK THIS COULD BE WE COULD UTILIZE THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WOULD ALSO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND IT COULD BE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT THAT COULD BE UTILIZED OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. THOSE DOLLARS COULD ALSO BE SPENT TO TRAIN MORE NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN PSYCHIATRY THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT CAME OUT OF A WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORT THAT CAME OUT ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO. WITH THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WE COULD TRAIN THREE HUNDRED MORE -- NURSE PRACTITIONERS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME GRANT MONEY GO -- GO OUT AS WELL TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS THINK THEY COULD SPEND IT ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS MORE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS -- HOSPITALS COULD USE IT FOR SOME OF THE RENOVATION AND RETROFITTING THEY NEED TO DO TO MEET SOME FEDERAL LIGATURE REQUIREMENTS THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN OUR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS. AND THEN WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT MONEY PUT TOWARDS -- IMPROVING ACCESS IN OUR RURAL AREAS ARE RURAL HOSPITALS STRUGGLE ON THE AGAIN THEY COULD IT COULD BE GRANT MONEY THAT COULD BE YOU SOMEONE TIME BASIS -- FOR TELUS IJCAI A TREE AND MORE REGIONAL CRISIS STABILIZATION SERVICES AND THEN LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GO TOWARDS DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS. CURRENTLY THERE IS A POSSIBLE. STRONG POSSIBILITY OF A CUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE ARE WORKING HARD TO STOP THAT BUT THEY COUD BE FACING A SIGNIFICANT CUT AS EARLY AS THIS FALL. SO VERY QUICKLY THOSE THAT THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE DOLLARS SPENT ON MOST MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SEE A RECALCULATION OF PROPOSITION. FIFTY FIVE WHICH I THINK WAS IN THE SPIRIT OF THAT OF THAT LAW WHEN IT PASSED IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN OKAY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM DCS ALEJO. WE CAN PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND IF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE ON HOW THE CALCULATION IS DONE AND AND HOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT -- THIS IS SOMETHING WE BROUGHT UP IN PAST YEARS -- BUT HAPPY TO TO REITERATE THAT IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WELL ACTUALLY WE DID HAVE A RATHER EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS -- NOT ONLY LAST YEAR BUT EVEN THIS YEAR. HI THANK YOU FOR I RECALL -- AND I DID ADMONISH THE PARTNER OF FINANCE -- ABOUT. THE WAY THEY CALCULATED BUT ALSO HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE INITIATIVE. AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW AND NEGOCIO THE GOVERNOR PUT THE SAN. LEFT IT ENTIRELY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO DETERMINE WHATEVER METHODOLOGY. AND WHILE I COULD INVITE ISSUE AGAIN THE PART OF FINANCE WHICH JERRY DID THIS YEAR ACTUALLY YOU'VE YOU PLAY BACK THE TAPE IS QUITE. WHO? TO PRY THE DEVICE ON GO THROUGH THE AND I DON'T KNOW AS IS QUITE A COOL AS A QUITE A LONG CONVERSATION -- I HAD TO ADMIT THAT LEGALLY I HAD NO. ABILITY TO DO THIS IT'S AN INITIATIVE I MEAN WE ALLEN THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD TRY TO PASS A BILL. TO TO FIX THAT SO -- SO I WILL TELL YOU THAT I SHARE YEAR -- CONCERN I HAVE. MAN MADE THAT POINT POINTEDLY AND AT LEAST IN THE A AND SEVERAL OCCASIONS HERE -- BUT IN THE END -- AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO AND I WILL URGE AGAIN I HOPE THAT WITH THE HOSPITALS THAT -- FINANCE LOOK AT THAT BUT SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN MAY BU WHATEVER THEY DECIDE THAT WE HAVE. VERY LITTLE ABILITY TO CHANGE IT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE WAY THE INITIATIVE WAS WRITTEN SO. I WILL APPEAL ONCE AGAIN TO FINANCE TO HONOR WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE SPIRIT THE ACTUAL SPIRITS AND INTENTION OF THE VOTERS. AND I SAID PREVIOUSLY I WON'T. GO THROUGH ALL OF IT BUT THAT ARE. WHEN VOTERS -- PASS INITIATIVES -- AND DAY -- AND WE DON'T UNDER DURING TENSIONS WE CAN DOWN LIKE THE STRICT BUT LEGAL WE DON'T HONOR TENSIONS THAT UNDERMINES TRUST. BY THE VOTERS AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEM AGAIN AND ASK THEM TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES FOR VERY IMPORTANT THINGS FOR THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. THEY RIGHTFULLY BECOME A LITTLE LESS. OPEN TO THOSE IDEAS BECAUSE THAT'S WHY I OFTEN HEAR SAY THAT ONE COMES INITIATIVE MONEY WE NEED TO SPEND IT THE WAY THE VOTERS INTENDED. BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE CAN KEEP GOING BACK TO THEM AND ASK THEM FOR HELP AGAIN AND WHEN THEY POINT TO THE FACT AND THE WE'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT IT'S NOT BEING DONE THE WAY THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THEM SO. NOW I'M REALIZE PART OF IT ALSO IS THE WAY WE WRITE THESE THINGS TO BUT SO I HOPE. BECAUSE OF WHILE I SAID THE WAY IS WRITTEN THE TORIES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE PARK FINANCE. I HOPE THAT. THE GOVERNOR WHO IS THE BOSS -- WILL -- THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT -- AT ABOUT THIS AND RECOGNIZE THAT -- THAT WHILE THERE HE HAS THE POWER PLANTS HAS THE POWER TO DO HOWEVER THEY WANT THAT I THINK THE WAY IT'S BEING DONE NOW. DOES NOT ACTUALLY REFLECT MY INTERPRETATION AND I THINK SOME OTHERS -- THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. DO YOU WANNA SEE MORE ABOUT THAT. WELL THE ONLY THING I'D LIKE TO ADD IS PARTICULARLY IN SUCH GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES I THINK CLEARLY VOTERS WOULD THINK -- THERE SHOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR MEDI CAL NOW IF NOT NOW WHEN WHEN WOULD IT OCCUR [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT. OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- NEXT UP WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA -- BIRTH CENTER ASSOCIATION TO OKAY SO WE HAVE AN ELIMINATION REIMBURSEMENT RATE PRODUCTION UNDER AB NINETY SEVEN FOR CERTIFIED NURSE WAS FIVES CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIVES APOLOGIZED. AND TURNED BIRTHING CENTERS AND THANK YOU WITH CALIFORNIA BIRTH SO STATION AND NEXT UP AFTER THEM WILL BE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION MEDICAL PRODUCTS SUPPLIERS. OKAY WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. MY NAME SHOULD COME MEANS AND I'M A CERTIFIED NURSE MIDWIFE AN OWNER OF THE BIRTH CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I AM HERE'S A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA PERCENTER ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK TO THE REQUEST FOR REINSTATEMENT MONIES. AFTER THE 10% REDUCTION IN MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR MIDWIVES NUMBER CENTERS. THAT HAS REMAINED FROM THE ORIGINAL 10% CUT TO MEDI CAL PROVIDER RATE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR BATES FOR HER SUPPORT TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE BUDGET DECISIONS. AB NINETY SEVEN BUDGET TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN PUT INTO PLACE A PAYMENTS FOR ALL PROVIDERS AND FACILITIES TO THE BUDGET CRISIS AT THE TIME. WITH THE REBOUND IN THE ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA THIS 10% REDUCTION WAS NOT REVERSE FOR ALL PROVIDERS ONLY TO PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS. THIS IS CURIOUS PERHAPS JUST AN OVERSIGHT AS MIDWIFE TEMPER CENTERS ARE NOTED AS MANDATED SERVICES FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. HOWEVER BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY NAME MIDWIVES AMBER CENTERS THE RESTORATION OF RATES WERE NOT INCLUDED. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH DH CS TO HAVE OUR RATES REINSTATED BUT WERE ADVISED THAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE SPECIFIC BUDGET OR BILL LANGUAGE. TO RESTORE RATES TO THE PRE AB NINETY SEVEN LEVEL. PER CENTERS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND WERE INCORPORATED INTO MEDICAL SERVICES FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES IN. TWENTY TEN CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE SAFE AND COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES OF MIDWIVES AND HAVE SUPPORTED THE POLICY THAT MIDWIVES WOULD RECEIVE A FOR SAME SERVICES PROVIDED. AT THIS TIME MIDWIVES ARE NOT RECEIVING A 100% OF THE PHYSICIANS PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE AS WE REMAIN UNDER THE CUT. REDUCED RATES MEAN REDUCED ACCESS WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARLY ENTRY ADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE. LASTLY PERCENTERS ARE NOT ONLY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE BUT ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE GOAL OF REDUCING CAESAREAN SECTION RATES. CARE PROVIDED BY MIDWIVES AMBER CENTERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION OF CAESAREAN SECTION RATES ARE 10220% LOWER. THAN TRADITIONAL KERR WITH COMPARABLE OUTCOMES. THERE ARE TWELVE LICENSE PER CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND MORE ARE BEING DEVELOPED YEARLY. THIS MODEL WILL CONTINUE TO SAVE THE STATE REAL HEALTH CARE DOLLARS. WE ASK THE 10% REDUCTION OF MEDI CAL RATES FOR MIDWIVES SUPERCENTERS BE REVERSED. MIDWIFE NUMBER CENTERS ARE POISED TO PROVIDE INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES. BUT CANNOT WITHOUT ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT WE ASK THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE INCLUDE RESTORATION OF MEDICAL RATES FOR MIDWIVES NUMBER CENTERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU INCOMES PERHAPS OF SERVICES ALEJO [inaudible] FINANCE OKAY. RIGHT I'D DAY WOULD MAKE NOTICE WE ARE HEARING THESE -- PROPOSALS. FOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTS THAT WENT BACK TO THE GREAT RECESSION [inaudible] THAT -- NO I THAT FIRST OF ALL WITH ITS -- IN TERMS OF REVENUE RESOURCES FOR RESTORING THOSE CUTS -- THEY WERE ABSENT FOR A VERY LONG TIME -- AND THE ONES THAT WERE VERSES BECAUSE THOSE ENTITIES WORKED TO BRING IN MORE REVENUE AND THAT'S THOSE REVENUES THAT WE'RE USING TO REVERSE AS RATES THAT'S WHY THIS IS UNDER PROP FIFTY SIX IT WAS. A CAMPAIGN TO BRING IN MORE REVENUE THROUGH PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX AND THE THE ENTITIES THAT WORKS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN OF COURSE -- YOU KNOW. IF THEY HAD TO BRING IN NEW REVENUE THEY DIDN'T JUST ASK FOR THE MONEY -- SO -- THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRY TO ADDRESS THAT FOR OTHER -- PROVIDERS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT -- AND SO CERTAINLY. NOT SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT FOR DOING THAT BUT THAT IS WHAT THE CELL PHONE AS YOU SAY WELL HOW COME THEY GOT IT AND I DIDN'T. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS PART OF HOW HOW THAT EVOLVED BUT WE ARE IN BETTER ECONOMIC TIMES AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW WE CAN. LOOK AT WHAT OTHER REVENUES WE HAVE -- COMING IN -- TO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION THAT'S OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS PLAYERS TO PRISON PROPOSAL MADE CHANGES REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND AND AND THE BETTER CIRCLE IS THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR SYSTEM IN REHAB TECHNOLOGY. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR OF BOB ACKERMAN BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL PRODUCTS SUPPLIERS. SO AS YOU KNOW DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT COMES IN A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND FORMS FROM THE SIMPLEST THING A WALKER TO A COMPLICATED I DON'T LIKE A VENTILATOR OR COMPLEX REHAB WHICH YOU HEARD. ABOUT THE SECOND. SUCH STORY METHODOLOGY FOR MEDI CAL SAYS THEY PAY 80% OF THE MEDICARE RATE FOR MOST DIEM IN UNDER PERCENT OF MEDICAREFOR CUSTOMER YOU HAVE. THAT IS FOR THE REDUCE CURRENTLY BY THE 10% PROVIDER -- ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION YOU JUST SPOKE ABOUT. SO OF THAT HAS EXISTED FOR I THINK ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS THOSE RATES IN URBAN GREAT BUT BUT SUSTAINABLE IN OUR FACE WITH CHANGES AND HOW MEDICARE'S CALCULATING THEIR REIMBURSEMENT. SO SEVERAL YEARS AGO MEDICARE BEGAN A COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROGRAM FOR DME A MOSTLY FOCUSED ON URBAN AREAS -- AND MUCH OF CALIFORNIA OF THOSE RATES GREATLY REDUCED THE ALLOWABLE UNDER MEDICARE SO. NOW WE'RE FACED WITH MEDI CAL THE BEGINNING TO USE THESE LOWER RATES EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. A SPA IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED -- WOULD MAKE THOSE RATES RETROACTIVE ONCE A SPA IS APPROVED AND IT WOULD BE -- THOSE MEDICARE RATES ARE RE BEING REDUCED FOR C. PAP FOR BEDS FOR SENATE WHEELCHAIRS BY MEDI CAL WOULD THEN TAKE 80% OF THAT AMOUNT AS THE PAYABLE. TO THE REDUCTIONS ARE MORE THAN MINOR THEY ARE A REALLY SIGNIFICANT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN -- IMPACT IN THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY WITH ACCESS TO DME THERE WAS A LUCILLE PACKARD -- STUDY FOR CCS WHICH SHOW 37% OF PATIENTS HAD DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING OFFENDER. BECAUSE OF LOW REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE OF UNWILLING TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND LONG DELAYS IN GETTING ACCESS THE NUMBER PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA HAS GONE DOWN BUT FOR OVER 40% THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING. MEDICARE HAS NOW SLOW DOWN THE COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESS DELAYED ANY NEW ROUNDS OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING UNTIL UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS. SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS GOING TO HAVE TO SERIOUS ACCESS ISSUES. WITH ACCESS TO DM ME IF THESE RATES ARE IMPLEMENTED IN ADDITION PROVIDERS ARE TOTALLY UNAWARE THE WHAT THESE RATES ARE GOING TO BE THE PROVIDING SERVICE RIGHT NOW UNDER FEE SCHEDULE IS PUBLISHED. THE CLUE IS GOING TO BE SO SLASH DRAMATICALLY -- ONCE THE SPAS APPROVED -- QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT VENTILATOR WE HEARD FROM EARLIER AND SUBACUTE THE VENTILATORS ARE -- A PRODUCT THAT THAT FEW DE ME COMPANIES PROVIDE BECAUSE THE COMPLEXITY BECAUSE THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CARE. FOR RESPIRATORY THERAPY EXCEPT FOR A THAT RATE WAS REDUCED BECAUSE OF MEDICARE CHANGES A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FROM ELEVEN AND ALWAYS A MONTH LATER DOLLARS A MONTH. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT THE EQUIPMENT'S EXPENSIVE DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL THE SUPPLIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPLACED -- THE BREEDING CIRCUITS THE TUBING ETCETERA THOSE ARE ALL PART OF THE RENTAL RATE. SO OF BEEN ACCESS IS BECOMING AN ISSUE YOU'LL HEAR FROM -- CCS PROGRAM A PROPENSITY TO GETTING A DELAYS IN GETTING KIDS OUT OF HOSPITALS BECAUSE A LACK OF OF THAT PATIENTS -- VENTA EQUIPMENT SO WE ARE ASKING FOR THE PROGRAM TO MOVE TO UNDER PERCENT MEDICARE RATES WHICH FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS HIM TO DO -- AND TO USE A BLENDED RATE BECAUSE THE REAL RATES UNDER MEDICARE IN CALIFORNIA DRAMATICALLY HIGHER WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE VERY LOW RATES IMPACTING. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND NON URBAN AREAS WITH RATES THAT ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE -- ALSO ASKING THE TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CUSTOM REHAB AREA OF THE MEDICARE -- ALLOWABLE AMOUNTS WITH THE USE OF MODIFIERS THAT UPGRADE OF THE REIMBURSEMENT CERTAIN ITEMS OF CUSTOMER YEAH BECAUSE THE COMPLEXITY. THANK YOU I TALK FAST. THANK YOU I HATE EIGHT COUNTS OF OUR HEALTH SERVICES ALEJO FINANCE OKAY. WE'VE ACT I MEAN IS ARE WE MONITORING ACCESS TO THE ME -- YES SO -- THE STATE PLAN THAT WAS MENTIONED HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO CMS IT IS STILL PENDING THAT DID INCLUDE AN ACCESS ASSESSMENT ON OUR PART TO THAT IT WILL BE PART OF CMS IS EVALUATION OF A APPROVING. THE THE REDUCTIONS. AND AS MENTIONED THIS IS REALLY NECESSITATED BY THE STATE LAW LIMITATION OF 80% OF MEDICARE AND THE FACT THAT. AT THIS POINT MEDICARE'S BEEN COMING DOWN AND SO THAT'S WHY -- OUR STATE PLAN AND OURS OUR STATE PLAN IS BASED OFF OF THE STATE LAW. OKAY SO DO WE NEED TO WELL I MEAN SO WE BENCHMARKED AGAINST MEDICARE RATE AND WE CITY PERCENT MEDICARE MEDICARE WAS OLD. A LOT HIGHER. THE FORMER IT'S BEEN COMING DOWN PRETTY THIN COMING DOWN A COMMON EXAMPLE LOCSIN CONCENTRATOR WHICH IS PRIME A RESPIRATORY TOOL CURRENTLY MEDI CAL IS REIMBURSING HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. THE NEW RATE WOULD BE FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT YEAH. SO I MEAN I THINK. APPRECIATE IN THAT AS WELL IF IT IS A SITE. NOW WE CAN ARGUE HOW MUCH OF A MARGIN MEDICARE TRIES TO BUILD AND I GET THE IDEA OF LIKE -- MAYBE SHE COME IN UNDER MEDICARE BUT IT'S MEDICARE'S REALLY COMING DOWN ON THEIR RATES AND THEY'RE TRYING TERM INTO RATES BASED ON ACTUAL COSTS AND SQUEEZING OUT PROFIT MARGIN AND WE'RE SAYING THEN YOU HAVE TO GO SUB PROFIT -- MORGADO I THINK WE HAVE SOME ISSUES SO -- I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO SOUNDS LIKE HIM HEARING A PATTERN HERE WHETHER V. NEED TO RE LOOK AT WHETHER THAT'S RIGHT BENCHMARK AND 80% OF MEDICARE OR OR IT'S A MEDICARE RATE OR SOME OTHER AND MORE INDEPENDENT BENCHMARKS THAT. ALLOWS US TO SURE ACCESS WITHOUT THE REPAIR WANTS TO BE UPROOTED PURCHASER. SO -- WE I THINK SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME TO MAYBE LOOK AT THAT BENCHMARK SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BUILT INTO A LOT OF IT'S A GENERAL IS GENERALLY HOW THE MEDICAID RATES ARE SET -- A LESS THERE'S A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY SO FOR MOST OF THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT THAT AREN'T SORT OF FACILITY SERVICES OR THINGS LIKE THAT IT IS. TYPICALLY BENCHMARKS 280% OF MEDICARE -- AND SO THEN WE HAVE TO UPDATE THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THESE OF MEDICARE CHANGING THEIR RATES IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL RATE THAT'S BEING PAID BUT YES THEY IT IS A GENERAL REQUIREMENT FOR MOST OF OUR OUTPATIENT AND SORT OF CANCELLARIA TYPE SERVICES AND IS THIS. TYPICAL OF OTHER STATES SEVEN THAT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY TYPICAL BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S AN MEDICARE RIGHT THAT'S THE PAYMENT FROM THE MEDICARE. PROGRAM AND THE 20% IS THE COST SHARING FROM THE BENEFICIARY -- SO THAT IT IS A VERY TYPICAL STANDARD. OKAY THAT IS WHERE IT REGIONALLY CAME FROM WHENEVER HOWEVER MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS HERE THAT. RIGHT BUT BUT I THINK WHAT IT BUT I'VE OBVIOUSLY THEN ON THE MEDICARE SIDE IS IS THAT THERE'S THE BENEFICIARY COST SHARING YOUR PAIN THE OTHER 20% OR TO HAVE A MEDIGAP PLAN OR SOMETHING THAT COVERS AT THIS CASE. WE'RE NOT EXPECTING LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO COUGH UP THE OTHER IMPORTANT. SO. SO WE I THINK WE'RE CLOSE THE SAY WE'VE THE THE ALMOST MANY OCCASIONS HERE IN THIS. THE SUBCOMMITTEE SINCE I'VE BEEN IN HERE WE'VE HAD RULES THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR DECADES THAT THE LONGER WORK AND I THINK IT'S PERHAPS TIME TO RE LOOK AT THEM. AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A CMS ISSUES RELATED TO THAT BUT I MEAN IT THEY WOULD ALL REQUIRES FEDERAL APPROVALS BECAUSE THEY 80% LIMITATION IS IN ANY ANY OF OUR STATE PLANS -- THE ONLY LIMITATION -- OTHERWISE AND IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE ARMY IS THE LIMITATION TO A 100% OF MEDICARE THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT EXIST FOR ANY OTHER SERVICES BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE CURE'S ACT. SO THAT THAT LIMITATION -- IS A FEDERAL LIMITATION BUT OTHERWISE. MEDICARE ITSELF IS NOT ACTUALLY A LIMITATION -- IN GENERAL I MEAN ON THE FACILITY SIDE UPPER PAYMENT LIMITS ARE BASED ON A MEDICARE WOULD PAY BACK ON THESE TYPES OF SERVICES IT WAS A BIT THIS WAS A VERY SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT. IN THAT IN THAT BILL OKAY SO SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING PERHAPS WE JUST SINCE IT'S A LIMIT AND THEN JUST DO A MEDICARE'S REALLY CRANKING DOWN THEN. THAT MAY MAKE MORE SENSE THAN. EIGHTY OKAY AND I WOULD ALSO VENTURE TO SAY IT'S A MEASURING ACCESS NOW BEFORE THESE NEW RATES ARE IN PLACE IS REALLY NOT. A BAROMETER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I MEAN ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS THROUGH PAID THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROVIDING THE SERVICE A LOT OF PARTS OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT WELL RIGHT NEW MEASURE NOW IT'S THE SITUATION NOW. SO IT'S NOT THEN WHEN WHEN DO WE EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN. SO THE STATE PLAN IS WITH CMS I WILL I ASSUME FOLKS KNOW THIS PART OF THEIR PROCESS ALSO IS TAKING. A STAKEHOLDER INPUT ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR ACCESS -- MOST SO YOU KNOW AT WE RARELY GET A STATE PLAN APPROVED IN THE NINETY DAY TIME FRAME SO I MEAN I I WOULD GUESS WERE PROBABLY STILL A FEW MONTHS AWAY FROM APPROVAL IF I MEAN AND AGAIN AND THEY COULD NOT GIVE APPROVAL. AS ANOTHER AS ANOTHER OPTION BUT IT IS CURRENTLY SLATED TO BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY OF THIS YEAR OKAY. AND OF GIVEN THE SITUATION SHOULD BE LEE LOOKING AT SOME PERHAPS LANGUAGE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE STATE LAW SAYS 80% THAT PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE. OTHERWISE YOU AROUND YOU TELL ME WELL YOU JUST. STATE LAW SAYS IT'S 80% SO EVEN IF WE WANTED TO WE CAN BECAUSE YOU TOLD THIS WEEKEND SO SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT THAT NOW. AND IN ANTICIPATION AND DOING SOME KIND OF SOMETHING THAT CAN GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. I WOULD NEVER DEEM TO SAY WHAT YOU SHOULD. SAY I SINCE I'M THE ONE SUGGESTING IT. YOU HAVE THE YOU CAN COMMENT ON WHETHER THAT WOULD BE ADVISABLE OR NOT -- SINCE I'M THE ONE SUGGEST YOU BECAUSE I KNOW I'M THE ONE WHO WOULD HAVE TO DO IT. I I AGAIN I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF HOW HOW HE WOULD DO THAT TYPE OF PROPOSAL OKAY WELL LET'S HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND WE CAN WE HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE -- BUT I AND ALSO LOOKING OUR BUDGET PROCESS IS IF WE WANT TO DO IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO IT RIGHT. BECAUSE OKAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. OKAY. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS. TO MAKE CHANGES TO REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY FOR COMPLEX REHAB HAS FROM NATIONAL COALITION ASSISTED AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT UP HERE AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION SAYS EACH YEAR IN THE BATTER CIRCLE SO FOR THE NEXT. FOLLOW UP. FOR THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE AFTER TO BE HERE. MY NAME IS DON CLAY BACK I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR SISTER RIYA TECHNOLOGY I'M HERE REPRESENTING OUR EIGHT MEMBER COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA -- COMPLEX READ TECHNOLOGY IS SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT USED BY. CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH HIGH LEVEL DISABILITY SO -- IT'S SOMETHING THEY DEPEND ON ON A DAILY BASIS BUT INCLUDE SUCH THINGS AS SPECIALIZE WHEELCHAIRS AND SEATING SYSTEMS -- OTHER ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT LIKE STANDING DEVICES IN GAY TRAINERS -- IT'S PROVIDED THROUGH A VERY -- TIME -- LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS INVOLVES THE PHYSICIAN THAT TYPICALLY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST OR PHYSICAL THERAPIST. AND THEN -- THE SUPPLIER ALONG WITH POTENTIALLY OTHER CLINICIANS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOMETIMES THEIR FAMILY OR CARE GIVERS. IT'S VERY INTENSE A SERVICE INTENSIVE AND IT'S FOR A REALLY A SMALL POPULATION AGAIN PEOPLE THAT HAVE. VERY COMPLEX NEEDS AND ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS THAT IT GETS LOST SOMETIMES IN THE BROADER MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CATEGORY BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF THAT IT'S A SMALL POPULATION. SO -- THE CHALLENGES THAT PROVIDERS ARE FACING IT IS JUST THE COMMITMENT THAT'S REQUIRED TO RUN A BUSINESS IN THIS ARENA THAT TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE CREDENTIAL PEOPLE. TO DO THE EVALUATION TO NOT ONLY GET THE EQUIPMENT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME BUT THEN ONCE SOMEONE HAS THIS KIND OF EQUIPMENT. IT'S PART OF THEIR DAILY LIFE SO IF THERE'S A REPAIR THAT'S NEEDED -- IF THERE'S MAINTENANCE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT IN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE LIKE A WHEELCHAIR SOMEONE IS A WHEELCHAIR WAS SPECIALIZED SEATING. THAT WHEELCHAIR BREAKS DOWN A LOS AND TELL THAT SHARES FIX THEIR PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN THEIR BAD -- IN THAT THE FLIES WHETHER AGAIN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD ADULT SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO SCHOOL WE'RE GOING TO WORK -- SO OUR CHALLENGE REALLY IS -- WHO IS THE -- COVERING THOSE COST AND ALSO MAKING IN -- THE ENVIRONMENT SUITABLE FOR COMPANIES TO STAY IN THIS BUSINESS AS A MENTION IS ONLY EIGHT COMPANIES AND CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PROVIDING THAT AND AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT COMPANIES FACE -- SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS -- REALLY REQUESTING TWO THINGS ONE IS THE RESURGENT RELIEF FROM THE AB 9710% CAUGHT. AND ALSO THE MODIFICATION OF THE UPPER BILLION LIMIT THAT APPLIES TO THESE ITEMS AND LOOKING FORWARD TO BE MODIFIED TO ALLOW SOME LABOR COMPONENT TO BE ADDED TO THE CALCULATION -- AND ALSO TO LOOK AT THE TOTAL WHEELCHAIR VERSES INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS -- WHAT WE THINK IS THIS REALLY FOR LEASE PROVIDE -- SOME -- ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THIS WE ALSO HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT MENTION ABOUT THE SPA THAT'S BEING THAT IT'S BEING PROPOSED. AGAIN IT'S GOING TO HAVE REDUCTIONS IN IMPACT ALSO THIS ARENA AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES THAT COMPANIES ARE UNDER IT'S ONLY GONNA MAKE ACCESS AND EVEN BIGGER ISSUE -- AND THEN THE FINAL THING JUST FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE IS THIS EQUIPMENT REALLY DOES SIGNIFICANTLY CONTROL REDUCE COSTS. ON FROM A MEDICAL SO -- MEDI CAL PERSPECTIVE -- THINGS LIKE PREVENTING MEDICAL TREATMENTS BECAUSE YOU'RE MINIMIZING IN -- SKIN PRESSURE -- ISSUES OR ORTHOPEDIC COMPLICATIONS -- IF A LOT OF THIS EQUIPMENT IN THE EVALUATION ARE DONE IN THE HOME SETTING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PROVIDERS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IS -- LOOKING AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GO OUT TO THE HOME AND REQUIRING PEOPLE TO COME INTO THEIR BUSINESSES FOR REPAIRS OR FOR EVALUATIONS. THAT COSTS WILL HAVE TO BE PICKED UP BY THE STATE SO IT'S ANOTHER THING TO KIND OF FACTOR AND SO -- SOCREATE THE ATTENTION AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS AND FOR HALF OF SERVICES ALEJO FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY WELL I CERTAINLY SOMEONE'S TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN SPECIAL NEEDS RECOGNIZE HOW THE SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT. I MEAN IS ESSENTIAL TO THEIR ABILITY TO BE MOBILE AND AND FOR THE FAMILIES HELP GET THEM AROUND AND AND SO FORTH SO I APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE. BRINGING UP IN HOW WE CAN HELP THESE FAMILIES CELL THANK YOU. SO MUCH IN HIS TALKS I GUESS THANK YOU THESE ARE MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- FINALLY WE HAVE A DETAILED FOR MEDICAL TRANSPORT IS ASSOCIATION PROPOSAL TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LONG AFTERNOON -- I'M BILL BAR TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION SOCIAIS XIN. OUR PRESIDENT -- STEVE HORN WHO IS IN THE BUSINESS WOULD GIVE YOU A MORE PRACTICAL IMPACT BUT HE HAD TO LEAVE ON FAMILY BUSINESS. BUT I'M HERE. OF REGARDING ANY EMPTY RATES I'M HERE TO REQUEST ASK IN LITERALLY BEG. FOR AN INCREASE OF OF THE MEASLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOLD GO A LONG WAYS IN. ONE OF RESTORING THE 10% CUT IN THE FAX SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND ADDING PROBLEM. DISPLACING PAPER SERVICE PATIENTS. WHO WHO'S CONDITIONS MEDICALLY JUSTIFY ANY EMPTY THAT'S A MANDATED BENEFIT UNDER EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH FINANCE AND WITH THE LA ALE? AND OTHERS. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW TRIPS BEYOND TEN MILES ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SO PATIENTS PARTICULARLY DIALYSIS PATIENTS TO RURAL AREAS ARE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO AND IF THEY MISDIAGNOSIS PATIENT -- TREATMENTS YOU KNOW THE RESULT MORE OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS OF THE AND MORE DIFFICULTY FOR THESE PATIENTS. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH A LOT OF MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS PAY A LOT MORE FOR ANY EMPTY SERVICES KAISER FOR EXAMPLE PARTNERSHIP SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY HEALTH PLAN. IF OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OUR TO BEAT THE SAME REQUIREMENTS -- THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS IN RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM. THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL MAKE CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS THAT THEY'RE FACED WITH LAWSUITS OR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DECISIONS THAT ARE ADVERSE. THEY WILL MAKE ALL KINDS OF EXCEPTIONS PAY -- FOR UNLOADED MILES -- ADICIONAL MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WAITING TIMES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. TO THE ONLY MAKE THESE EXCEPTIONS ON THESE UNUSUAL SITUATIONS WHEN THEY'RE INVOLVED LEGAL ISSUES OR A HIGH HIGHLY VISIBLE PATIENTS. SO WE THINK THE THE SITUATION JUSTIFIES THE INCREASE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS IT JUSTIFY. ANY EMPTY ENTERED YOUR OF SUPPORT FOR INCREASING THIS. MUCH NIGHT NEEDED SERVICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM FOR HIS SERVICES HELLO. FINANCE OKAY AND THAT PEOPLE LOOK I MEAN THE LOOK AT IT LOOK THAT. OF PEOPLE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THEIR I GUESS -- DIALYSIS POINT MINUTES OTHER APPOINTMENTS HE SAID THIS SOMEONE SOMEONE. LOOKED SYSTEMATICALLY AT THE SEVEN I'M SURE THE SITUATIONS REAL BUT NOW. SELL THEM AT SOME. BUTTONS BUT I CASE BASIS UP THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM IN THE IN. THE A CS OR IT AND AND AND DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE AS WELL. DOESN'T WORK TERRIBLY WELL WE'VE HAD PEOPLE IN OUR OFFICE TRY TO LODGE COMPLAINTS THEY'LL LOGIC COMPLAINT OF BUT A NEEDED DIALYSIS TRIP AND GET A CALL BACK A MONTH LATER. AND SO THAT DOESN'T WORK SO THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM THAT IS HEAVILY RELIED UPON BY SO I EVENT OF A I GUESS IN SOME SENATE ANNE AND I GET THAT A CALL FOR THE COMPLAINT NOTHING YOU KNOW DON'T BUT I MEAN THE LOGGING OF THE COMPLAINTS ALSO HELPS. SO I REALIZE IT DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM I AM -- I'M JUST TRYING -- TO POSES A I'M TRYING TO MAKE AN ARGUMENT FOR YOU THAT ARE WE Là. IS THERE A WAY I CAN ARGUE THAT. USES THIS FAIRLYSMALL AMOUNT THAT WERE ACTUALLY LOSING MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE BUSY TREATMENTS AND NOW THAN SAID OF GAINED ALICE'S STAND UP IN THE HOSPITAL AND BOY THAT WITH THAT COUPLE HOSPITALIZATIONS MAY MAKE UP THE WHOLE AMOUNT. OR NOT IS THERE SOME WAY TO QUANTIFY THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I REALIZE THAT THERE MAY NOT BE THAT EASY TO DO THAT YEAH I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT FROM THAT PRSPECTIVE I THINK. AS MENTIONED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS IS A MANAGED CARE -- AND pMEMBERS ARE SMALLER -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN ANY SORT OF SPECIFIC CHANGES IN UTILIZATION OF OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW. MY TEAMMATE BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE THAT I CAN ASK THEM I JUST DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENT LOAD IS DIMINISHING IT'S TURNING ALL THE TIME PEOPLE FALL IN AND OUT OF MANAGED CARE SO THEN THEY GO FOR MANAGED CARE WHERE THEY WERE GETTING GOOD SERVICE? BACK TO FEE FOR SERVICE BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO FILE RIGHT PAPERWORK OR SOMETHING OR OTHER SO THEN -- BACK -- WITHOUT TO SERVICE FOR SIX EIGHT TEN MONTHS TILL THEY GET BACK ON MANAGED CARE SO IT'S A CONSTANT THE MATTER AND THERE'S ALWAYS NEW FEE FOR SERVICE PATIENTS COMING UP ON TO THE PROGRAM BEFORE THEIR SIDE. SO THEY MAY BE SMALL IN NUMBER BUT IT TO CONTINUALLY -- EXISTING GROUP OF ABOUT 20% OF THE PATIENTS SOLELY THEY'RE NOT TO BE -- JUST DISMISSED AS BEING A SMALL GROUP BUT IF THE THE FOR SERVICE WERE TO PROVIDE ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT MANAGED CARE DOES IT WOULD END TO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THESE PEOPLE. SO WE WOULD URGE FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION ALRIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE THOSE HELPFUL THE SIN THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE BE ABLE. TO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT IF WE DON'T DO THIS ACTUALLY GONNA COST US MORE MONEY IF POSSIBLE SO -- SO SO ANYWAY BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. OKAY SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS I WILL YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS OUT MAKE NOTE THAT THERE IS A PRESENTATION ON EACH ONE SO -- THE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ALTHOUGH IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A NEW ONE YOU CAN BUT IT'S PROBABLY BEST FIRST OF ALL IF YOU HAVE ANY GENERAL COMMENTS. ON THE PROPERTY SIX MEDIC -- CAL PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND JUST INDICATE WHICH STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS. YOU REALLY LIKE -- I REALIZE A LONG LIST OF THEM AND I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT MAKING AN ARGUMENT FOR THE ONES THAT YOU LIKE I THINK THE PROPONENTS THREE HAD A CHANCE TO DO THAT SO.

TWENTY SIXTEEN HOWEVER THE MEASURE ALSO STATES THAT -- CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED IS TO BE INTERPRETED AS IT WAS INTERPRETED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SIXTEEN SO.

OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SO A REAL POTENTIAL. TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON SOME PROVIDER ACCESS IN THE STATE OKAY SO YOU'RE TALKING ONE POINT TWO MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS. ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE.

BY THE MEDI CAL WORK FORCE TO ENSURE ACCESS. SIMILAR TO OUR PREVIOUS COMMENT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN EVALUATION OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM AND CONSIDERING THE OVER SUBSCRIPTION WE WOULD LIKE FOR OUR PREVIOUS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED IN FUTURE YEARS SPECIFICALLY. ARE RAISING THE MEDI CAL THRESHOLD -- LOAD FROM 30% TO POTENTIALLY A HIGHER NUMBER AS WELL AS OTHER LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS OF THAT MAYBE REDUCING THE AMOUNT SO THAT THERE ARE MORE -- AWARD AMOUNTS AVAILABLE INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AWARDS PER YEAR THANK YOU.

IT'LL HELP US RECRUIT AND RETAIN PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS IN CALIFORNIA IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST NEEDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. OKAY SEEN OTHER COMMENTS -- TO I ALSO WANT TO ECHO -- THE STATEMENTS BY SOME OF THE CDA ABOUT THE THEY KNOW TAKES TIME BUT THESE PROGRAMS UP AND YOU'VE DONE EVER. DONE A VERY QUICKLY AND SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE DON'T KNOWLEDGE TIMES WHEN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT AND OUR EMPLOYEES INTERACTION. THINGS QUICKLY WE JUST LOOK AT THE TIMES WHEN THINGS DON'T GO SO FAST. I THINK SO SHE DOES THE TEAM WHO'S WORKED ON IT HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB YES EXCELLENT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK CELL. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN IT'S THE PROPOSITION VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM OR SO AS PART OF THE JANUARY BUDGET THE GOVERNOR DID PROPOSE -- IS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR FOR THREE YEARS VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM WE DID RELEASE AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA AT THE DOOR THE INITIAL LIST OF OF MEASURES. WITHIN SORT OF THE FOR DOMAIN AREAS THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND THE AGENCY REALLY FELT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND THAT'S PRENATAL AND POST PARTUM CARE EARLY CHILDHOOD PREVENTION. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION -- MET JUST TO QUICKLY HI LATE OVER BECAUSE IT BECAUSE I KNOW IT. THIS PROGRAM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE AN AND REALLY THAT IS YOU KNOW WE HAD TO STRUCTURE IT IN A WAY. THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD THE DATA TO DO THIS AND THIS IS DOING VALUE BASED PAYMENT ON THE PHYSICIAN LEVEL. IT IS NOT AT THE PLAN OR THE GROUP LEVEL. SO WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER DATA WE WERE USING YOU COULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT DETERMINE PAYMENTS FROM THAT SO JUST A FLAG THAT BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS DIFFERENT THAN YOU KNOW SORT OF SOME MORE OTHER TYPICAL VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAMS -- MET SO WE AS NOTED DID DID RECEIVE COMMENTS WE ARE JUST FINALISING -- THE REVIEW OF THOSE I KNOW THE QUESTION WAS WOULD IT BE CHANGING SUBSTANDARD OR SIGNIFICANTLY -- I DON'T KNOW THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME ADDITIONAL MEASURES THAT WERE SUGGESTED -- THAT WE THINK COULD COULD MAKE SENSE TO ADD AND SO WERE THE TEAM IS COMPILING ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT OUT PRETTY SOON -- SO THAT FOLKS CAN SEE THE FINAL AND THEN AS WE HAD NOTED IN THE RELEASE OF THE DRAFT THERE WAS NO -- VALUATION OF THE MEASURES LIKE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WOULD GET FOR PARTICULAR ACHIEVEMENT. WE FELT WE NEEDED TO FINALIZE THE MEASUREMENT LAST BEFORE THEN WE COULD START TO HAVE THAT SO ONCE WE GET THAT FINALIZE WILL START TO TALK ABOUT SRT OF THE BEGINNING OF THE MONEY INTO THE FOR AREAS. AND HOW WE THINK -- THE DIFFERENT MEASURE SHOULD BE VALUED. SARAH COMES MEGLIO. IN A REPORT WE DID THE WE DID. PRELIMINARILY EVALUATE THIS AND SORT OF WE DID PROPOSE ALTERNATIVELY -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE THIS FUNDING TO PROVIDE -- VALUE BASED PAYMENTS MORE ON THE MANAGED CARE LEVEL -- GIVEN THE SORT OF DELEGATED MODEL WE WOULD YOU KNOW -- ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE ACCORDING TO THESE MEASURES AND THEN PAY THEM AND THEY WOULD -- PAY PROVIDERS AS NEED BE SO THAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCT TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS -- HAS A PROPOSED TO DO WITH THIS FUNDING -- IN IN LIGHT THOUGH. OF THE THE THE NAME PREVENTIVE SERVICE FOR CHILDREN AS WELL AS THE SORT OF MORE GENERAL INCREASED ENFORCEMENT. OF HE THIS MEASURES ANOTHER -- ACCESSING QUALITY MEASURES WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS ARE SOMEWHAT DUPLICATIVE WITH WHAT WE ARE DOING A LOT MORE ON THE OVERSIGHT SIDE OF THINGS -- SO WE'LL GET INTO THAT I THINK -- ON THE ON THE NEXT ITEM AS WELL SO ARE THERE MEASURES THAT WE ARE NOW REALLY ENFORCING HOLDING MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING -- AND THEN ALSO -- SORT OF ON THE OTHER SIDE ALSO PAYING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT NOTHING WRONG WITH NECESSARILY BEEN DOING BOTH BUT ONE ONE OPTION MAY BE A MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO DO SO AND MOREOVER MANAGED CARE PLANS MIGHT NEED TO BE PAID FOR SOME OF THE MORE -- FOR THE GREATER ADHERENCE -- TO THE HIGHER STANDARDS THAT THE STATE IS IMPOSING SO WE JUST TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT -- AT LEAST FOR SOME OF THE NEW VALUE BASED PAYMENTS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REPRESENT A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE -- THE STATE IS REALLY INCREASING ITS ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES [inaudible] FINANCE. THIRTY MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE PLACES WATER SOME OVERLAP AND SEE HOW MUCH THAT MOVES THE NEEDLE VERSES THE PLACES WHERE THERE ISN'T. OF ANY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. FROM A VALUATION STANDPOINT. AT THE RADICALLY YOU THINK ALL WOULD DUPLICATING SO THEREFORE. YOU KNOW THEM IT'S JUST THAT DOUBLING UP OR WERE DOUBLE PAYING FOR SOMETHING BUT I I JUST A POSE THAT QUESTION TO YOU IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DID RESEARCH ON QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SO. YEAH I MEAN AS A AS A RESEARCHER AT THAT DEFERRED YOUR EXPERTISE THERE THE MEASURES CAN BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK SO MAYBE ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION I'M NOT SURE OR YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SORT OF A CORRESPONDING -- SAY -- HE THIS ENFORCEMENT MEASURE THAT'S GOING ON AND HOW DO YOU SORT OF COMPARE SAY THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH INTEGRATION -- TO YOU KNOW A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OR WELL CHILD VISIT SO. RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL PROMISE THERE -- BUT WE HAVE TO EVALUATE IT FOR THEIR ALL RIGHT -- SO I DO APPRECIATE THE THIS -- AFTER VALUE BASED PAYMENT -- AND IN FACT -- AND THE FACT APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE WE HAD A HEARING ON IMMIGRATION OF CARE AND THERE WAS SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT -- THING THAT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT SAMPLE ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE AND THE MEDIC OUTSIDE TRYING TO A LINE -- RIGHT AS SO THAT. SO WHILE WE DO HAVE I THINK WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SEGREGATION AND THE NATURE OF PROVIDERS TO BE -- GIVEN THAT OUR LOW REIMBURSEMENT SO FORTY SEND TEND TO HAVE LIKE THIS GROUP DOES MEDI CAL THAT GROUP I MEAN THERE ARE MANY WHO DO BOTH. AND AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET TO THAT WHAT CAUGHT TIPPING POINT CHANGING BEHAVIOR AND SOMEONE'S PRACTICE. IT'S GOOD IF YOU KNOW EVERY PAYER ARE ALMOST ALL THE PLAYERS ENOUGH PAIRS OF THEIR PRACTICE ALL WANT THE SAME THING BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU AS A PHYSICIAN IF. NO ONE CARES LIKE 20% OF MY PRACTICE AS A DO AX. AND OTHER ONE IS 15% READ THOSE WHY A AND THE OTHER ONES IS THE YOU KNOW THE YOU CAN GO ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S GREAT EXCEPT. NO I TO MAKE THE CHANGE ACROSS OUR PRACTICE IS NOT LIKE I GO LOOK AT INSURANCE CARDS ALONG A TREAT THIS PERSON THIS WAY AND THAT ONE THAT WAY RATES THAT'S THE SYSTEM YOU PUT IN PLACE YOUR PRACTICE YOU KNOW YOUR NURSES YOUR CLERK SOONER THEY'LL AND HOW AND WE DO. CORPORATION CARE AROUND WHICH DISEASES AND LIKE A CELL. ALSO -- WHEN THINGS I'M HOPING THAT AS THIS IS DEVELOPED TO THINK ABOUT IT WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITIES ALSO ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE GIVING THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW WE PAY FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE FOR CALPERS AND WE HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA SO? FOR TO TO TO BUILD ON THIS AND THINK ABOUT HOW. WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW SO APPRECIATE YOU HAVE THIS PROPOSAL HERE AND THAT. SAYING THAT OKAY WELL SUPPOSE HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS SAYING OKAY LET'S HAVE SOME COMMERCIAL PEOPLE THINK ABOUT DOING THE SAME THING AND SEE HOW WE CAN COORDINATE. SO BASICALLY YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME SIGNAL THAT'S GOING OUT TO THE REVISED HERS AROUND THESE PARTICULAR AREAS RIGHT OKAY. SO THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT ISN'T DOES THIS ONE JUST BE FROM THE MEDI CAL SIDE FOR THAT MAY BE ACROSS BOTH MEDI CAL AND NOW THEY'RE MAJOR COMMERCIAL PAYERS WE MAY NOT GET ALL THE PLAYERS BUT ENOUGH THAT IT'S LIKE OKAY WELL THAT'S PLAY THAT'S YOU KNOW FALLEN THAT IT MAKES SENSE FOR ME TO NOW CHANGE THE WAY I DO THINGS MY PRACTICE -- BECAUSE IT'S JUST IT DID HAVE A BIG IMPACT. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND I'M IS SINCE SINCE THAT HEARING -- J. C. COOPER WHO WAS AT THE THE THE PART ONE LEADING NETWORK WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO A CALPERS AND COVER CALIFORNIA START ON THIS IS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE METRICS AND OTHER THINGS. PROPOSAL BUT I THINK WHAT YOU HAD SUGGESTED TO US AND NOT HEARING LIKE WHAT WHAT QUALITY MEASURES ARE WE LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE HAVE SOME. CONSISTENCY WHERE IT MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS BUT SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING DOWN THAT PATH AS PART OF SORT OF OUR FUTURE MEDI CAL PLANNING THAT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER SO DEFINITELY AGREE THAT WE WANT TO TRY. TO DO WHAT WE CAN SO THAT WERE CHANGING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT IF IF YOU'RE AFFECTING SORT OF A LARGER PERCENT OF THE POPULATION. OKAY. WELL I I APPRECIATE THAT. NAM AGAIN AND TAKE THE PARTICULAR MEASURES THAT. THERE IS A SAID PLEASE THROW. IT'S NOT ON THE LIST THERE BUT YOU KNOW THIRTY SCREENING FOR PRE DIABETES. THE SERVER SO. CLOSE THROW THAT OUT THERE -- YOU SUBMIT US ANY COMMENTS THAT THE TWO ARE I DON'T THINK I I WILL TAKE YOUR COMMENT EVEN THOUGH IT'S PAST VIA. WE GET TO TALK TO YOU HERE. THE AYE AYE NO I WAS LOOKING AT I THINK YOU HAVE A REALLY GREAT SET OF MEASURES -- AND THAT NOT LOOKING TO UPSET THE APPLE CART BUT YOU KNOW AT NIGHT AND SEE DO YOU HAVE A MEASURE OF DIABETES CARE ITSELF BUT MY THINK ABOUT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IN THE WAS IT. US PREVENTIVE TASK FORCE THING RIGHT -- THE GUIDELINES AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT ALMOST HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT WELL IF. YOU DON'T IDENTIFY THEM BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DIABETIC YET THEY'RE OFTEN NOT IDENTIFIED. AND THEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO WORK STOP THEM FROM DIABETIC. AND THE NAME THE SO SO SO DEBTS CAL ITSELF ANYWAY. SORRY. WATCHING SO THEY'RE PROBABLY LATER RARELY GO GREAT I GOT SIR PAUL. RIGHT OKAY ANYWAY. I'M NOT GOOD TRIED UP TO THE TOP OF CARD ANYMORE NOW YOU HAVE SOME EXCELLENT MEASURES HERE. AT THAT WAS JUST THE ONE I WAS LIKE WELL I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THAT ONE OUT. OKAY -- EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS THEN ALL RIGHT -- SO WE DO HAVE TO STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS -- WHO I GUESS PEOPLE OF MORE SUGGESTIONS -- ALL RIGHT -- SO THE FIRST WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL TO PRIORITIZE METRICS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES -- THAT'S FROM THE CALIFORNIA TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES -- THE AREAS FOCUSED ON PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE CHRONIC DISEASES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE AREAS WITH -- PERSISTENT AND WELL DOCUMENTED DISPARITIES -- WE ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT -- SIMILARLY TO CONSULT WITH COVER CALIFORNIA OTHER PAIRS AND WE KNOW THAT MEDICARE AT THAT -- CMS JUST UPDATED THEIR VALUE BASED PAYMENT -- PROPOSALS WHILE -- AS A WHOLE SYSTEM MOVES TOWARD VALUE BASED PAYMENT WE NEED PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ACCESS AND MONITOR DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. A RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT FAILURE TO PRIORITIZE HEALTH EQUITY IN EMERGING KERR MODELS ACTUALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO EXACERBATE THEM. AND THEREFORE WE'RE REQUESTING THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT IN THE VALUE BASED. PAYMENT PROGRAM THAT PRIORITIZES THE REDUCTION OF DISPARITIES -- AND THE DH CS CONSULT WITH A BROAD SET OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE MECHANICS OF THE PROPOSAL -- THE METRICS AT WE WE PROVIDE A COMMENTS ON THE METRICS AND I THINK THE METRICS THEMSELVES ARE YOU KNOW VERY. BE ABROAD AND WE APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE THEM I THINK AS PROPOSED THOUGH -- THAT THERE'S A FAILURE TO CLEARLY STATE THE DISPARITIES REDUCTION IS A GOAL TO TIE PAYMENTS EXPLICITLY TO HAVE HELPED THE SPURS REDUCTION OR TO IMPROVED COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF PATIENT DATA -- BY SPECIFIC SUBPOPULATIONS -- AND THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT -- MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE ADEQUATELY INVESTING AND IMPROVEMENTS AND TO CLINICAL PROCESS SEES AND CONSUMER EXPERIENCE AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL -- ARE ARE. YOU KNOW PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD ADD ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES TO STRENGTHEN THE COLLECTION AND REPORTING. OF PATIENT DATA BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE LGBT Q.. STATUS AND OTHER FACTORS -- TIES PAYMENTS TO HEALTH DISPARITIES REDUCTIONS AS MEASURED BY CHANGES AND OUTCOMES NOT JUST PROCESS SEES -- INVEST IN IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CLINICAL PROCESSES OF CARE -- FOR EXAMPLE BY INCENTIVIZING COMPLETION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS ON THE ADOPTION OF FEDERAL -- AND SEE. HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TWENTY FIFTEEN STANDARDS -- FOR EHR CERTIFICATION AMONGST OTHER OF PROPOSALS -- THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP TO STRENGTHEN -- PATIENT EXPERIENCE -- INCLUDING AVAILABILITY OF EVENING AND WEEKEND APPOINTMENTS AT CETERA -- YOU KNOW THIS IS A I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCE DISPARITIES BUT ONLY IF WE MAKE THE THAT COMMITMENT EXPLICIT -- SO WE REALLY URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE -- DESPAIRS REDUCTION AS A GOAL AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. THANK. YOU COMMENTS FROM THE EIGHTY S.. I THINK THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE I THINK IT GOES BACK TO MY PRIOR STATEMENT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM BEING AT A PROVIDER LEVEL. AND SO THE KINDS OF DATA THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE I THINK WE SHARED THAT THE DESIRE TO REDUCE DISPARITIES I I THINK WE STRUGGLED WITH HOW COULD WE ADDRESS THAT. IN THE TYPE OF STRUCTURE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND SO -- I KNOW WE DID RECEIVE COMMENTS OR OR STILL GOING THROUGH THOSE BUT I JUST WANTED TO FLAG IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT A PRIORITY IT'S CAN YOU ACTUALLY DO IT AND THAT YOU KNOW DATA AS YOU KNOW CAN BE CHALLENGING -- AND AS IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW THE DATA COLLECTION THAT WE SO OUR RACE ETHNICITY DATA TODAY AND MEET IN AND IT HAS TO BE OPTIONAL. AS OURS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY ALSO HAVE THAT INFORMATION -- FOR A WIDE. PERCENTAGE THERE I THINK WE'RE LIKE AT 20% A KNOWN OR OTHER IN GENERAL IN OUR MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY DATA SO. AGAIN TOTALLY APPRECIATE AND AGREE THAT THAT IS A GOAL BUT HOW I THINK WE STRUGGLE WITH HOW DO WE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT IN A STRUCTURE LIKE THIS OKAY. HELLO ANY COMMENTS FINANCE. OKAY -- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT -- THE PROPOSAL AND SHARED GOALS IS CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHO -- HAS BEEN FIGHTING ABOUT TRYING TO DRESS -- DISPARITIES IN -- AND THAT SHE FOR THE API COMMUNITY TRYING TO ACTUALLY DISAGGREGATED SO SHE FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY DOING ANY OF THAT INFORMATION -- BUT ALSO REACT -- RECOGNIZING UM AS SOMEONE WHO'S THAT PRACTICE SPACE RESEARCH SO OKAY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL. THE KINDS OF INFORMATION SO WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE THE OFFICES ASK INFORMATION LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR RATES AND AND AND SO FORTH. WE CAN'T COMPEL SOMEONE ANSWER IT IS GONNA BE SELF IDENTIFIED SO WHEN WE WE THERE ARE ELEMENTS TO DO THAT -- BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE QUITE AS NEAT CLEAN AS PEOPLE EXPECT WILL BE AT MIGHT BE PRETTY FUZZY AND DEPENDING ON IT I THINK WHEN YOU AGGREGATE EVERYONE YOU MAY GO GET A BETTER IDEA BUT IT CAN BE HARD -- TO FOR PARTICULAR SO AS YOU GET DOWN TO A PARTICULAR POSITION AT SEA ON THIS BENT ON THE PATIENT BASE RIGHT -- AIDS IS THAT IT YEAH SAID TYPICAL PRICE YOUR PHYSICIAN ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND PATIENTS -- THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE MEASURES IF YOUR PEDIATRICIAN AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT WELL CHILD WILL. THAT COVERS A GOOD PORTION OF THEM BUT THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DIABETICS THAT'S A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER AND SO -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TRY TO REDUCE -- THE SPIRIT IS THE THING IS IS THAT YOU HAVE A HANDFUL OF PATIENCE. HOW DO YOU DO THAT ON A SENTENCE OF SIDE -- FOR THAT PARTICULAR DIE YOU CAN TRY TO DO AN AGGREGATE BUT THAT'S MORE AT THE HEALTH PLAN -- MEDICAL GROUP LEVEL. AND SO -- BUT I THINK WE SHOULD YOU KNOW CERTAINLY FIGURE OUT HOW. TO CHIP CHIP AWAY AT THAT MAYBE OVER TIME YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET MORE SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE POINT OF TIME WITH NUMBERS OF PATIENTS OVER TIME YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FIND SOME WAYS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THINGS. AS WELL AND I CERTAINLY THINK -- ONE THING WE CAN BE COMMITTED TO YOU IS BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE A VALUE WAIT. THEN THE RESULTS AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL TO SEE YOU KNOW NOT ONLY AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL BUT YOU KNOW NOT AGGREGATE TOTAL POPULATION BUT AGGREGATE BUT BREAKING BROKE BROKEN DOWN BY THE POPULATION INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. TO SEE WHAT EFFECT IT DID HAVE WHAT WAS THERE A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT IT OVERALL AGAIN NOT OUT THE PHYSICIAN. LEVEL BECAUSE AGAIN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND ALL OF THAT SO I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE THING WILL WILL BE LOOKING AT AND THINKING ABOUT FOR THE EVALUATION COMPONENT OF THE VALUE BASED. TO AT LEAST SEE IF IT IF IT DID HAVE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS AND IF SO THAT MAY BE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE AS WE LOOK AT STUFF IT ARE THERE OTHERS OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING AS WE LOOK AT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. PHOTO LOG THE OTHER LEVEL THAT WAS ALSO RECRUITMENT SWITCH. WHO'S PARTICIPATING IN WHICH COMMUNITIES -- AND RIGHT. BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TALKING ABOUT. OVERSTOCK OTHER ANTI GOT ABOUT THIS FOR WAY TOO LONG. BUT SO ANYWAY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK WE US ALSO FOR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO BECAUSE AS AS WE CANSEE JUST HERE THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE SENATE. WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT IT THIS IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION TO MEASURE AND APPRECIATE THAT WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS SO I THINK. YOU KNOW FOR FOR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION AND REALLY. FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE CAN DO THIS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE PARTS THAT NOTE TO GET TO WHAT YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT IS IS ACTUALLY IT IS GOING TO BE PROVIDER. GROUPS INVOLVEMENT WHICH ONES ARE IN PART OF THE VALUE EIGHT SO. SO BECAUSE INHERENTLY WE MAY NOT BE A MEASURE ON THE MEL TO GIVEN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PER PHYSICIAN BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN POSITIONS OF A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS IN DIFFERENT. YELL AT THE GROUP'S DIFFERENT SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES AND SO YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IS YOU GO BACK I HAVE A VALUE BASED PACE AND SAVE SYSTEM AND ALL THE YOU KNOW. IN THEM YOU KNOW HELLO THIS IS NETTA CAL BUT YOU KNOW THERE. ARE CERTAIN THERE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF YOU KNOW CERTAIN RIGHT AND THAT AND YOU KNOW ALL THE ONES WHO ARE TO YOU KNOW ALL THE ONES ARE TAKING A KERIO WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. YOU KNOW HIGHLY -- NOW AFTER AMERICAN OR SOMETHING ARE PARTICIPATING OUR OR OR AREN'T PERFORMING. LET'S SAY THAT'S THE OTHER THING TO BE INCLUDED BUT THEIR QUOTE NOT PERFORMING IN. YUP THINK LIKE -- WHAT'S GOING ON IT IS IT. IS IT THE WAY WE STRUCTURED THIS IS IT YOU KNOW WHAT CELL BECAUSE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE DISPARITIES MAY SHOW UP TO WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN ADOPTION OF EHR TECHNOLOGY PARTICULARLY FOR YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE GETTING TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER LEVEL AND THE AMOUNT OF TA. I MEAN. THAT'S ANOTHER I THINK FOCUS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE'S YOU KNOW ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN BE DOING TO HELP BUILD UP INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW CLINICS AND PRACTICES TO MAKE IT. EASIER FOR THEM TO COLLECT AND REPORT THE STATE AS WELL. YEAH WELL THAT'S SO THAT THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE ON TOP OF THAT. OKAY WHOA I THINK WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE THERE BEFORE WE STRIVE TO DESIGN THE SYSTEM HERE. AND WE'LL FINISH SOMETIME TOMORROW -- SO THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL OKAY NEXT UP WE HAVE -- THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION REQUEST VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM FOOD FQHCS RURAL HEALTH CLINICS [inaudible] WELCOME. I'M THINKING MISTER CHAIR OMINOUS TROUBLE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATIONS -- WE SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION EFFORT TO CREATE A VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM. THAT WILL INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE -- CLARITY OF CARE AND MEETING CERTAIN METRICS THE PROPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT HOWEVER WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CAR AND TRY TO BE LANGUAGE. IN THAT IT -- DOES NOT SPECIFY DOES DOES NOT -- IN. COMPREHENSIVELY INCLU ALL PROVIDERS -- MEDICAL PROVIDER IN THE PROGRAM SO WE PROPOSE AMENDMENTS SPECIFICALLY -- TO ENSURE THAT ALL MEDICAL PROVIDER WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN DESK VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM. TODAY ONE PART OF THE MEDIC COW POPULATIONS ARE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS THESE PATIENTS OFTEN LIVE IN POVERTY THEY ARE SICKER AND MORE VULNERABLE AND THEY HAVE RELIED ON COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AS THE ONLY SOURCE OF CARE. THESE PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE QUALITY CARE INTO ENTITLED TO THE SAME SERVICES THAT ARE AFFORDED -- WELL TO AUTOMATIC HOW -- PATIENCE AND THEY WILL BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THIS PROGRAM -- FOR MY RESEARCH -- WE DIDN'T FILE THEY ARE KNOLL -- SPECIFIC LAW REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBIT -- COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THIS KIND OF PROGRAM. SO -- WE ASK THAT WE SUBMIT THAT THE AMENDMENTS AND WE ASK THAT -- YOU ADOPTED THE CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSE AND I'M TO THE POINT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS AND EQUITY A THING ONE THIRD OF THE MEDICAID POPULATION THESE ARE. THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES AND DATA PROVIDERS ARE ALSO LOOKING AND EAGER TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. COMMENTS FROM PARKER SERVICES. NO I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES THIS IS WHY YOU KNOW WE MADE WE MADE THIS CHOICE AGAIN TO TRY TO HAVE THE MONEY GO SORT OF AS FAR AS IT COULD -- THE IT IT IS TRUE THAT THERE'S NO FEDERAL PROHIBITION ON ON THIS. THAT BEING EXTENDED TO TO THE CLINIC I THINK IT'S IN THE END -- YOU KNOW DECISION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OKAY HELLO [inaudible] FINANCE. THE PERSON HI. GEORGE THIS IS YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. WHAT I LOOK FOR MAGIC IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY EXCELLENT? AND OF THAT BEFORE BUT FOR THE RECORD OKAY -- GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE THAT. CLINICS PLAY IN MEDIC HOW. HOW HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM CAN WE HAVE WITHOUT THE CLINICS I MEAN I ASSUME THAT THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION RIGHT -- THROUGH I MEAN IT'S SIMILAR TO THE OTHER PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THAT WERE DOING ON THE PHYSICIANS AND THE DENTIST WE DID THOSE DO NOT GO TO FQHCS AN ARTERY SO IT WAS JUST. REMAINING THE SAME AS AS SORT OF ENHANCED PAYMENT BEING DIRECTED AT THOSE PROVIDERS WHO ARE UNDER A NON PPS REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE [inaudible] OKAY. AND ALL RIGHT. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS. GETTING IT DONE. PAYMENTS THROUGH THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT SYSTEM SO ME PERFORM A CERTAIN LEVEL BEYOND THE PBS YES AND IN. JUST FOR THE RECORD THE PPS WILL CREATED IN -- TWO THOUSAND TO PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL -- SAFEGUARD FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER. TO TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO UNINSURED POPULATIONS AND INTO PPS -- WHEN IT WAS CREATED IT WASN'T INTENDED TO CALL OF A THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROPOSING THAT THE V. P. PROGRAM? SEOUL WHEN WHEN TRYING TO LIE -- THOSE SORT OF SERVICES TOGETHER IT'S IT'S UNFAIR FOR THE FOR THE PROVIDER AND UNFAIR FOR THE PATIENTS -- THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE A MINORITY AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE -- LIVING IN POVERTY AND AND TOLD ME CLEAR THOUGH THE SERVICES ARE ALREADY REQUIRED SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED THIS IS JUST PROVIDING A QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT SO IT'S NOT I WOULDN'T I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE PPS DOESN'T COVER THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE THESE ARE WELL CHILD VISITS THESE ARE. THE CASE MEANT NEO DIABETES CASE MANAGEMENT SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S NOT PAYING FOR SERVICES FOR THOSE POPULATIONS IT'S NOT PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENT TO THE PROVIDER [inaudible] OKAY. AT THANK YOU AMERICANS WHO WERE GONNA HAVE A CALIFORNIA HELPLESS ADVOCATES AND TOTALLY UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNED COMMENT AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AS YOU KNOW. THE DOCTOR PAN YOU WORKED WITH US PREVIOUSLY ON A BILL AND WE ALSO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS THROUGH YOU -- TO CLARIFY SOME INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AT A HEALTH CENTERS ALREADY DO PARTICIPATE IN OUTSIDE OF THE PPS RATE AND ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT -- ALSO BILLING FOR THAT AND THEY'RE PPS RATE AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THIS WOULD BE A PROGRAM THAT WE COULD PARTICIPATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER SO. OKAY. YEAH. DATES OF THESE ARE THE THIS IS THIS IS A VALUE BASED PAYMENT MEANING THAT YOU GET A FOR FOR PERFORMING THEM YOU GET REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICE BUT WE WON'T WE WHAT IF YOU ACHIEVE A CERTAIN STANDARD THAT'S THE VALUE PART RIGHT. AND YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS INCENTIVE TO TO DO THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND THE TWO STAKEHOLDER OF PROPOSALS. WELCOME. RAIN SPENCER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS -- THE FAMILY PHYSICIANS SHARE IN THE DESIRE TO CHEAP TRUE VALUE BASED. PAYMENT THAT BESIDES THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS TO DO THIS SO WE BELIEVE ANY BEEP B.. B. B.. BY PAY STATEMENTS PROGRAM SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOME PAULINE -- CONDITIONS REWARD BEHAVIOR OVER OUTCOMES ALIGN INCENTIVES WITH EXISTING PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT AND PEACE PCMH MODELS CONSIDER THE MERITS OF THE PAPER PERFORMANCE COULD RELATIVE TO TRUE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT. ENSURE THE TIMING AND SIZE OF INCENTIVE. PAYMENTS AND FOR DESIRABLE BEHAVIOR AT A FAMILY PHYSICIANS DID PREVIOUSLY SUBMIT COMMENTS TO THE APARTMENT AND BE HAPPY TO SHARE THEM WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AND I'M TRYING TO SAY SAY V. B. V. B. P. CORRECT SOME REASON KEPT. SAYING IT SO THANK YOU RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. WELCOME. THERE'S ALL THE DOOR WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP -- WE'RE ALSO IN SUPPORT -- WE DO HOPE THAT -- DH CS ALSO INCLUDES METRICS TO REWARD PEDIATRIC -- PRACTICES FOR COORDINATION AND REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME AT THREE DEGREE GONE ON BEHALF OF THE FIRST FIVE BILLION FOR SERVICES YUSHIN IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROGRAM. WE SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES INTEREST IN BUILDING QUALITY IN THE INTO THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL STEPS TO STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF EARLY IDENTIFICATION REFERRALS LINKAGE TO APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND HIGH QUALITY INTERVENTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE -- THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS AND INPUT INTO THE THESE NEW THREE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE RESULTS OF THAT PROCESS -- AND WE ALSO AGREE WITH YOU THAT ANY NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM SHOULD ALSO ALIGN WITH -- OTHER COMMERCIAL PROGRAM SO THAT PHYSICIANS ARE MORE EASILY ABLE TO COMPLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN SEND ONLINE POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S. PROPOSAL AND ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE PEN IN ADDITION THE OF FQHC PROPOSAL I MAKE SENSE TO US ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ONE OF THE MATRIX IS -- COLOCATION OF PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THE NOTE ON THAT COMMUNITY CLINICS -- TO DO THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. RICHARD FRANCIS WITH CHILDREN NOW CHILDREN NOW SUPPORTS THE V. B. P. PROPOSAL AND SOMEWHAT WITH SEVERAL PARTNERS WE'VE ALREADY MADE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO TEACH CS ON HOW THEY CAN STRENGTHEN THEIR CURRENT PROPOSAL. WHILE THE PROPOSED VALUE BASED PAYMENT INCENTIVES ARE VALUABLE FOR STAFF WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUE TO REFINE AND IMPROVE THESE EFFORTS OVER TIME TO THAT END WE EXPECT THE FCS TO CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS TO BEGIN TO CONSIDER FUTURE PROPOSALS. FOR VALUE BASED PAYMENTS THAT WILL ADDITIONALLY IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE FOR CHILDREN AND EXPECTING MOTHER. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. NO WAY BOTTOMLESS EERILY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF C. PENCE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME HI MICHELLE CUT IT OUT WITH A C. R. U. CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU WILL -- HUMOR ME I WANT TO KICK OUT AS WELL A LITTLE BIT ON C. PENS VALUE BASED PURCHASING PROPOSAL -- WE THINK THAT DATA ISN'T COLLECTED AS WELL IN TERMS OF RACE ETHNICITY IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IN ANOTHER HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE IT DOESN'T REALLY SERVE A PURPOSE RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN IN THE AGGREGATE LIKE CD PH REPORTING KIND OF SENSE. BUT WE THINK THERE'S A TON OF POTENTIAL IF WE WERE TO INCENTIVIZE AND REALLY DRIVE DATA COLLECTION TOWARD AN END I. E.. DISPARITIES REDUCTION THAT WE COULD. KIND OF DO BOTH THINGS WE COULD WE COULD GET THE DATA WE NEED AND THEN START TO DRIVE FOR MEANINGFUL CHANGE THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MOVING FROM THE TRIPLE AIMS TO THE QUADRUPLE AIMS RIGHT. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE SO LUCKY -- YOU KNOW I STUDIED THIS LITTLE BIT TOO AND I SAW THAT IN MASSACHUSETTS THEY TRIED SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE OF COLOR TO DO IT. WE HAVE AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN MEDIC HAL AND SO JUST FROM A SORT OF A NUMBERS PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE COULD DO POTENTIALLY TO TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT BUT IS IS IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S EVEN MORE MEANINGFUL IN A PROGRAM. THAT'S OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH. THE EFFORT TO TRY TO TAKE IT TO THAT NEXT LEVEL TO EXPLORE WHAT VB P. PROGRAM AROUND DISPARITIES PRODUCTION MIGHT LOOK LIKE. IN MEDIC COW -- CAL COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH IS MUCH SMALLER OBVIOUSLY HAS STARTED A DOWN THIS PATH HAD MAY HAVE SOME LESSONS LEARNED FOR US BUT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER APPROVAL OF THAT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT OBSERVATION AND I THINK. I THINK I THINK IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING IT THEN. WHETHER WE DO IT OR NOT SELL. THAT OKAY WELL APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AT JUST THE ONE OTHER QUESTION THEN -- WILL SO YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF YOU GOT LOT OF SUBMITTED COMMENTS IT'S A WIN WIN DO WE WHEN DO YOU EXPECT. TO COME UP WITH THE FINAL PROPOSAL -- MET. SO I HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT FROM MY TEAM AT SOCCER SO IT'S GOING TO PROBABLY BE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF WEEKS I WOULD SAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO SHARE IT. IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I AM A I BELIEVE IT'S COMING TO ME SOON SO HOPEFULLY E CAN GET THAT OUT PRETTY QUICKLY. OKAY SO. FEW WEEKS HE SAID I THINK SO OKAY ALL RIGHT IF I'M TOTALLY WRONG I'M SURE SOMEONE'S GOING TO TEXT ME AND BE LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T HVE SAID THAT BUT AND A LOT'S GOT NO THAT I WAS WRONG. I AM. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I BELIEVE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING IT LIKE TOMORROW OKAY ALL RIGHT SO SO IN FEW WEEKS WE SHOULD YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW I GOT IT OKAY. WITH MY COLLEAGUES. SHARE WITH US. TO OKAY. I KNOW ALL RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I I THINK THE OTHER THING I WAS ME NO NINETIES ON A COMMENT ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE START OF SOMETHING AND SO I REALIZE AND BELIEVE ME I CAN COME WITH A LOT MORE MEASURES AND SO. FORTH LET'S START WITH -- SAID DOOM WELL SEE HOW IT GOES AND THEN WE SHOULD THERE'S MANY OTHER WORTHY MEASURES OTHER THINGS AND WE CAN BUILD ON THAT AND CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE AN ON GOING PROCESS I MEAN. WE WE HAVE TO GET THIS ONE STARTED FIRST WHERE -- IT'S THIS PROVES SUCCESSFUL -- AND I KNOW WHAT THE FUSES TOO MUCH OUT SO THAT WE CAN TEST HOW SUCCESSFUL WE CAN BE WITH THIS AND THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW. WE CAN SHOW WE CAN DO THIS WITH THE MEASURES THAT YOU HAVE THEN BUILD OUTS BECAUSE CERTAINLY DOES MANY OTHER MEASURES MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT COME UP AS WELL. AND THEN -- BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THAT SO [inaudible] OKAY. I THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT -- THEY WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT -- ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN DEVELOPMENTAL AND TRAUMA SCREENING. SO AS PART OF THE JANUARY BUDGET THEY GOT TALKING TO A PEDIATRICIAN YEAH IT IS A PROPOSING -- MED IS SCREENINGS FOR PAYING ESSENTIALLY SEPARATELY FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND TRAUMA SCREENINGS -- TODAY IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE WORLD THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING IS A BILLABLE SERVICE -- IN MANAGED CARE THE LIKELIHOOD IS IT'S NOT SEPARATELY PAID FOR IT IT'S PAID AS PART OF THEIR CAPITATION OR OR OR OR WHATEVER ELSE THERE HOWEVER ELSE THEY'RE PAID. SO THIS WOULD REQUIRE IN THE MANAGED CARE SIDE A NEW DIRECTED PAYMENT SO THAT TO THE DEGREE OF PROVIDER DOES -- NOTE IN IT THEIR ENCOUNTER THAT THEY PROVIDED THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING OBVIOUSLY IN. IT HAS TO BE IS PART OF THE NORMAL BRIGHT FUTURES IS GAY OR NOT JUST ANY HI OR THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT AND THEN SIMILARLY. ON THE TRAUMA SCREENING SIDE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A LITTLE NEWER IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE -- WE DID HAVE THE EIGHTY THREE FORTY WORKGROUP -- RECOMMENDATION TO USE THE PEARLS TOOL FOR CHILDREN -- AND SO WE ARE WE WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A SURGEON GENERAL WHO IS VERY WELL VERSED IN IN IN CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ISSUES AND TOXIC STRESS AND SO SHE'S. PROVIDING US A LOT OF GUIDANCE -- AS WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE YOU. SORT OF GET THIS OUT OF THE DOOR -- FOR ADULTS THE THE SCREENING WOULD BE THE ASUS TOOL WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW SORT OF THE STANDARD THAT WAS FROM THE KAISER STUDY MANY YEARS AGO -- AND AND REALLY WE WE BELIEVE IN AND YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND WANTING TO DO THIS REALLY EMPHASIZING -- EARLY CHILDHOOD AND JUST THE NEED TO BETTER IDENTIFY THE NEED THAT WHAT NEEDS PEOPLE HAVE -- SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE WITH THIS I THINK -- YOU KNOW FOR FOR PATIENTS THAT NOT HAVING TRAUMA IDENTIFIED APPROPRIATELY LEADS TO MISDIAGNOSES ON A MENTAL HEALTH SIDE IT LEAVE IT AT DOES THAT HELP TODAY AND EXPLAIN WHY THERE'S CHRONIC DISEASE THAT'S HAPPENING IN IN THE BODY AND SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. WE DO RCOGNIZE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THAT I WOULD FLAG -- ONE AND I KNOW THERE'S A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL WE ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE PROVIDERS ARE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED ON THE TRAUMA SCREENINGS -- GIVEN THAT IT ISN'T NEW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S IT YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TYPICALLY DONE TODAY SO THAT OF COURSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT SENSITIVE AND UNDER YOU KNOW. THAT THE FAMILY UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THAT IF THE SCREENING IS LITTLE BALD LIKELY IDENTIFY GAPS IN AVAILABLE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE AND SO HOW DO WE THEN TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND USE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN ORDER FOR US TO IDENTIFY WHAT WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE. THANK YOU COLLEGE MILIEU. YEAH RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- I HAVE A A FEW -- COMMENTS ARE SPECIFIC TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING SOME OF THESE WILL ALSO APPLY TO THE TRAUMA STRUM SCREENINGS. BUT WHO FIRST START WITH -- OUR OFFICE AGREES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND IDENTIFYING I CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ALL INFANTS AND TODDLERS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS BUT RESEARCHERS -- SUGGESTS THAT AS FEW AS ONE OUT OF FIVE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ARE CURRENTLY BEING I IDENTIFIED AND SERVED WITH IN THE STATE. OUR OFFICE HAS SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- DIVING INTO THIS AND OTHER ISSUES IN EARLY INTERVENTION IN SPEAKING WITH PARENTS AND PROVIDERS AND RESEARCHERS ACROSS THE STATE -- THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS RARELY COMES UP AS A PRIMARY REASON WHY WE'RE NOT SERVING ALL ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. AMONG THE REASONS THAT WE COMMONLY HERE ARE THAT. SOME PARENTS COULD DISCOURAGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN -- THE WELL CHILD VISIT AT WHICH THERE THEY'D RECEIVE A SCREENER AT THAT IDENTIFIES SOME ISSUES. AND I'M GOING TO THE FORMAL PROCESS OF BEING DETERMINED ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICE AT REGIONAL CENTERS SAID. VARIES ACROSS THE STATE THE EXACT PROCESS BUT IS OFTEN. COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE FOR PARENTS WHO ARE NEW TO THIS OR EVEN ONCE A PARENT HAS -- SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE URGE CHILD IDENTIFIED IS ELIGIBLE -- PARENTS OFTENTIMES GET DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND A PROVIDER -- PARTICULARLY PROVIDERS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT MEDICARE ALL RATES. AND PARTICULARLY PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO SERVE THE CHILD IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT MEANING TEIR HOME WHICH IS NOT ONLY OF COURSE CONVENIENT FOR PARENTS BUT ALSO. REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AS DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE -- SO IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE GENERAL COMMENTS WE'VE GIVEN TO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PACKAGE TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE COST EFFECTIVE. OPTIONS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE MOVE SOMEWHERE MAKING TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT CONTRACTS WHICH INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS BE PROVIDED. AS PART OF A WELL CHILD VISIT. WITH AND TO THINK THAT THERE RE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT IDENTIFYING AND SERVING MORE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN -- WE LAY THOSE OUT IN OUR RECENT BUDGET ANALYSIS BUT AS ONE EXAMPLE WE COULD OFFER SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS SPECIFICALLY TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT SAYS FEDERAL LAW SUGGESTS THEY SHOULD -- ONE ADDITIONAL THOUGHT IS THE GIVEN THE LARGE POPULATION OF CHILDREN WHO ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SERVED. WE SHOULD BE THINKING AS PART OF ANY STRATEGY TO IDENTIFY AND SERVE MORE CHILDREN HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMMODATE THAT NEED -- LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IF WE DID IDENTIFY AND SERVE ALL CHILDREN THAT ASSOCIATED COSTS ON THE DDS SIDE OF THE BUDGET. WHO WOULD INCREASE BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET? AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION WERE SERVING OVER EXPERIENCING -- NOTABLE PROVIDER SHORTAGES PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE. IN AN INTERESTING THOSE MIGHT REQUIRE SOME UP FRONT -- EXPENDITURES FROM THE STATE AND THOSE COULD EASILY BE WITHIN THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THIS EARTH [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] COMMENTS OKAY. WELL -- CERTAINLY -- I AGREE THAT -- WE BUY A LOT OF I MEAN FOR THE REASON WE'RE PROPOSING THAT'S BEING THIS IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND IS BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY UNDER DIAGNOSED SAYING -- AND ANYWAYS I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING. IF YOU THINK OF IT ALWAYS SERVICE FROM A MORE INFORMAL PROCESS. AND THEY ALSO THE PEDIATRICIAN AND WE HAD THE THE DENVER A DENVER TO WHICH ACTUALLY IS. TO OKAY IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK AND YOUNG A YES NO AND WHAT TIME DID YOU WALK IN ROLL OVER AND SO FORTH -- TO DOING MORE FORMAL MORE VALIDATE SCREENINGS -- AND THOSE SCREENINGS ARE MORE STRUCTURED -- SOMETIMES THEY MAY TAKE MORE TIME. AND FRANKLY -- SOME OF THEM AND THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED VERY HARD TO DEVELOP THEM AND VALIDATE THEM AND SO FORTH SOMETIMES EVEN CHARGE MONEY FOR THEM RIGHT SOMEONE THAT'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. RIGHT BUT BUT THE REASON -- SO USEFUL BECAUSE SOMEONE TO DO ALL THAT WORK TO VALIDATE AND SO FORTH AND I THINK AS WE'VE MOVED FORWARD IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIANS TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN. TO SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA USE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY MEANS WHAT IT IS IT'S NOT A COMPUTER SOMETHING TECHNOLOGY -- IT'S COSTING MORE IT'S CAUSING MORE TIME IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY THE LICENSING FEES AND STUFF LIKE THAT TO TO USE THESE TOOLS AND SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING SOME MORE FUNDS INTO THAT SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW ALL CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO HELP SCREENS NOW THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS AN HOUR GOING DOWN TO FIND MORE CHILDREN WE ME HOPEFULLY WITH THE FIVE MORE ACTUALLY. TOO AND WHAT YOU DO WITH ALL OF THEM RIGHT SO THE PROCESS WE HAVE THEN OF THE DRESSING THAT YOU KNOW GETTING THEM IN EARLY INVENTION TO REGIONAL CENTERS. GETTING TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY THE WAY -- SO. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSION AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION RIGHT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW SPECIAL IT STARTS AT THREE YEARS. NOT SCHOOL ROMAN THREE YEARS OLD. OKAY AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EVEN PAY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THREE YEAR OLDS. TELL THOSE IT IS ADDED TO JUST GETS ADDED TO THEIR SPECIAL ED BUDGET OR SO THAT'S ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SITE AND THEN OUR COURSE OF GOVERNMENTAL CENTERS SO. CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TACKLE I APPRECIATE LA -- BRINGING THAT UP IT MAY HAVE SOME SERIOUS BUDGET -- IMPLICATIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO SIT AND THEN NOT LOOK RIGHT SO YEAH BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. OH MY GOD YOU KNOW SWEDES WON'T LOOK AND THEN WE WON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD PRETEND LIKE NOTHING'S GOING ON AND BUT BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT BECAUSE IF IT ISN'T IT. SOMETHING IS GOING ON JUST HAPPENS WE DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK THAT WAY AND I THINK I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER EITHER I KNOW THAT SOMEBODY APPLYING I THINK YOU'RE. YOU'RE JUST GIVING US THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AND GIVING US A HEADS UP LIKE OKAY THIS IS THE IMPLICATION OF THAT AND WE'LL WALK INTO THIS. AND THEN I THINK YOU KNOW THIS LEGISLATION GOVERNOR WILL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT HOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. AND AND TO DO THIS AND MAYBE THERE'S A THERE MIGHT BE SOME MORE EFFICIENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS AS WELL THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO ETCETERA. BUT I THINK WE FIRST GOT TO KNOW WHAT THE FIND THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM FIRST AND WITH THAT WE NEED TO MEASURE IT AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING THAT WE ACTUALLY -- THAT IF I MEASURE -- FOR THIS IS AS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP YES. YEAH AND WE DO APPLIED THAT EFFORT -- TO TO DO BETTER AND IDENTIFYING A ONE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT DOES ARISE THROUGH A MANAGED CARE PLANS AS WE DON'T WE DON'T PAY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SCREENING AND LIKE WE WOULD IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT RESULTS IN DATA GAPS IN. IN THE NUMBER SCREENINGS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY REPORTED WE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS OCCURRING TODAY AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAD GOOD DATA. THAT COULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO WE HAVE A WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE CURRENTLY SCREENING 50% OF KIDS SO IT IT IS A IT IS A PROBLEM HOWEVER I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE THE EXPANSION IN THE OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE INCLUDES A SPECIFIC -- DATA MEASURE ON APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS OCCURRING BY AGE THREE SO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD NOT MEET THAT -- THEY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CAP -- TO A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR SANCTIONS SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE -- ADDITIONAL EFFORTS THAT ARE OCCURRING THAT COULD SOLVE THIS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE A COST OF OF MANNER. THANK YOU AND I WOULD MAKE A NOTE -- THAT I WOULD THINK THAT -- FOR THIS PAYMENT -- WE NEED TO HAVE FAIRLY WELL DEFINED CRITERIA SO THE PROBLEM IS WE SAVE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE BEING SCREEN I'LL TELL YOU THE QUESTION. THE REAL QUESTION IS IS THAT TO WHAT LEVEL SCREENING. RIGHT SO EVERYONE OF ACCESS TO A PEDIATRICIAN VISIT HAS BEEN DEVELOPMENTALLY SCREENED QUESTIONS IS IT -- THE EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY AND WHAT YOU COULD WALK AROUND WHICH IS A LEVEL DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING FOR YOUR AGE AND ALL. HE DEVELOPED THE EYE FOR THAT BUT IT'S BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT US MORE FORMALIZED VALIDATED. RIGHT SO AT THAT LEVEL SCREENING WHAT PERCENTAGE THAT THEN SEARCH RANKING RIGHT SO AND I THINK THAT'S THE EXPECTATION I PRESUME -- FOR TO RECEIVE A PAYMENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT AND WE'RE STILL FINALIZING POLICY ON HOW WE WOULD TRACK BOTH THAT BEING TRUE ON BOTH THE DEVELOPMENTAL SIDE AND THE DRAMA OUTSIDE RIGHT -- TO MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT. WHOEVER'S THAT THAT THEY'RE GIVING AN APPROPRIATE SCREENING AND THAT THEY ARE DOING IT APPROPRIATELY. RIGHT I MEAN AGAIN I THINK AS I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK ON THE DRAMA SIDE IN PARTICULAR RIGHT IT'S CAN TRIGGER PROBLEMS IF YOU JUST ASK QUESTIONS IN A CALLOUS WAY SO -- MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND THAT THAT THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT SO THAT IS WHAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT IS HOW DO WE IN AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL AND ON BOTH THESE PROPOSALS. TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE END IT'S IT'S ACCOMPLISHING WHAT WE WANT WHICH IS APPROPRIATE SCREENINGS HAPPENING APPROPRIATELY. WELL IN SOME SENSES AND WE JUST CAME OUT THIS GUY SING ABOUT VALUE BASED PAYMENT WHAT WE WANNA DO IS WITH THESE PAYMENTS BUT ALSO WITH THE STANDARDS ASSOCIATE OF CHANGE THE CULTURE. RIGHT AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DOCTORS AND THEIR STAFFS IT ALSO BECOMES ABOUT THE PATIENT'S RIGHT SO. IF IT BECOMES ROUTINE FOR EVERYBODY THEN IT'S NOT LIKE WELL YOU JUST ASKING ME BECAUSE YOU THINK SOMETHING'S GOING ON IN MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE. EVERYBODY WHO GOES -- YEAH I THEY ASKED ME THAT TOO IN THE BOX OFFICE THEY ASK ME THAT TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. THIS IS WHAT'S NORMALLY SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN RIGHT AND AND THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT WE WE DID TRY TO CONSIDER THE THE THE PROPERLY EVALUATING QUESTION WHEN WE WERE. CONDUCTING OUR ANALYSIS AND IT DOES IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AMERICA CORRECT ME IF -- IF IF I AM WRONG BUT THE CURRENT CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS ON MANAGED CARE PLANS REQUIRE USING AN APPROVED -- USING ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED TOOLS. SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL LOOK INTO NOW BRIGHT FUTURE SAYS SOME GOOD GUIDELINES BUT SOME THAT HAS TO BE SOME VERY SPECIFIC TOOLS AT THIS. PARTICULAR AGES THAT WOULD TRIGGER THIS OKAY WE MIGHT NEED TO REACH OUT TO YOU TO GET SOME INSIGHT SINCE NO. ONE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT FOR ME THERE YOU GO ALL RIGHT.

TO THAT SO WILL HOLD OF THOSE ITEMS OPEN WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS -- FAMILY PLANNING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR SO -- IN THE ORIGINAL AND A COUPLE OF YEARS OF PROP FIFTY SIX THERE WAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES -- THE VAST MAJORITY IN IN FAMILY AND FAMILY AND THAT'S PACKED PROGRAM -- WE REALLY FELT LIKE IT WAS APPROPRIATE. AS WE WERE LOOKING AT RECESS YOU KNOW THAT WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD BE SPENDING THIS MONEY TO ACTUALLY ADD SUBLIMINAL PAYMENTS TO THE MEDIC HOW FAMILY PLANNING -- MOST SIDE AS WELL -- TO REALLY TRY TO YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE EQUIVALENT OBVIOUSLY THE THE POPULATION IN F. PACKED IS A MUCH SMALLER POPULATION -- ABOUT A MILLION INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH THAT PROGRAM BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THIRTEEN MILLION NOT ALL OF THEM FAMILY PLAN. BUT SO. THE WHAT SO WHAT WE HAD PUT OUT ORIGINALLY WAS A TWENTY DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR THE SAME CPT CODES THAT WERE BEING USED -- FOR THE F. PACKED I WILL SAY WE WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A DEAD ISSUE IS THAT THERE WAS A DATA ISSUE SO WE ARE RE EVALUATING THAT AND CERTAINLY EVALUATING THE PROPOSAL FOR THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE STAKE HOLDERS -- MISS SO I WOULD SAY TO STAY TUNED TO FLORIDA IT'S STILL THE SAME DOLLARS IT'S JUST -- WHAT THE ACTUAL PAYMENTS SUPPLEMENT PAYMENTS WOULD BE? OKAY THANK YOU L. L.. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT WE W RECOGNIZE AND MAKING PARITY WITH THAT FACT IS A POTENTIALLY GOOD YOU KNOW GOOD REASON -- TO AUGMENT AND USING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX IN THIS AREA WOULD ALSO -- RECOMMEND LOOKING AT ACCESS ISSUES AND WHETHER THOSE ARE OCCURRING IN SORT OF JUSTIFY THE REASON -- JUSTIFY THE THE PAYMENT INCREASE IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU FINANCE OKAY -- I APPRECIATE THE COMMON THAT -- WERE GONNA BE HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS RAY SHORTLY -- YEAH I THINK MY CONCERN SO I SHE SHOULD SAYING ALWAYS TREAT YOUR COLLIDES IS THAT -- IN ORDER TO GET THE MAXIMUM I GUESS IMPACT IN TERMS OF ACCESS AND SERVICES THAT -- THE FUNDS ARE DISBURSED SO MUCH THAT ACTUALLY THAT IS AN INCENTIVE FOR SO BASICALLY I MEAN IT'S GREAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET A LITTLE EXTRA PAYMENT BUT NOW PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY YOU KNOW IT IS IT REALLY GOING TO INCREASE ACCESS OR IS IT JUST THE WELL I GOT. PAID A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE ME CHANGE SOMETHING NEEDS TO SELL THEM THEY ALWAYS APPRECIATE AN INCREASE. BUT IT YOU KNOW BUT LANDS NOW WE SPREAD IT OUT SO THIN. AND PEOPLE GOT LITTLE PAYMENTS AND SO CUMULATIVELY. IT'S NOT MOVING THE NEEDLE ON ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING SELVES GREAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY SHOULD BE PAID MORE FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I'M HOPING THAT. THE GUIDING THE GOAL OF THE FUNDING SINCE THE TIME YOU KNOW WITH FOR WE FIRST STARTED IT IS TO REALLY TRY TO FOCUS AND TRY TO BUILD CAPACITY. AROUND FAMILY PLANNING AND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE THAT AS A JUSTIFICATION BUT I'M. BUT I AND I I THINK THAT IS. THAT SWEAR I HOPE WE CAN GO AT THAT AND PERHAPS THE STAKE HOLDERS MY I DON'T KNOW THEY'LL SAY THE SAME THING OR NOT I OKAY WITH THAT -- WHEN WE GO AHEAD AND BRING UP STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL SO I THINK WE HAVE PLANNED PARENTHOOD HERE WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAN'T FORGET AT THE BUTTON -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME AS WELL OUR STAFF -- MY NAME IS ANDREAS AND THE GAL IN THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING SEVEN AFFILIATES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHICH SERVE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS AT A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE TODAY KILL THE LENS OF THE DATA COORDINATOR PEACOCK -- SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OUR THOUGHTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD DOUBLE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THROUGH -- PROP FIFTY SIX DOLLARS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED JANUARY BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR FAMILY PLANNING IS ABOUT BUILDING OFF OF THE EXISTING -- INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO FAR THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST TWO YEARS -- WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO SEE MORE PATIENTS -- AND TO DECREASE WAIT TIMES THROUGH FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND ALSO THROUGH SOME WORK FORCE INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER EVEN WITH THESE INVESTMENTS THERE IS STILL A GROWING ON MEN NEED FOR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. THROUGHOUT THE STATES -- WHICH WE'D BE HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT A LATER TIME WHEN THERE AREN'T MORE ITEMS IN FRONT OF YOU -- THIS UNMET NEED IS CONTRIBUTING TO PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES -- AND WE BELIEVE DIRECTLY RESULTING IN HIGH RATES OF PREVENTABLE MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY -- AS A TRUSTED PROVIDER FOR SENSITIVE SERVICES AND OFTEN THE ONLY PROVIDER -- THAT MANY OF OUR PATIENTS WILL SEE DUE TO OTHERWISE BEING YOUNG AND HEALTHY -- THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAN PROVIDE MORE SERVICES THAT CONNECT WITH MATERNAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -- AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT -- NAMELY INFANT HEALTH -- SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS MONEY HAS A REAL MEASURABLE KLEINFELD IMPACT FOR THOSE PATIENTS. WHO NEED CARE THE MOST WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND WE SPENT SEVERAL MONTHS RESEARCHING WITH OUR AFFILIATES -- TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY THEY BELIEVE ON THE GROUND TO MEET THE GOALS LAID OUT NOT JUST BY THE GOVERNOR BUT BY. THE PROP -- FIFTY SIX INITIATIVE ITSELF. LIKE MANY OF THE OTHER SPACES IN THE BUDGET WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO ENTER WE'VE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS. AND MAKE SURE INVESTMENTS BUILD UPON EACH OTHER SO WE CAN ALL GET THE MOST OUT OF IT -- BECAUSE WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES FACED BY CALIFORNIANS IN OUR PATIENT BASE IN PARTICULAR. ARE NOT SILO ROAD LIKE OUR BILLING STRUCTURES SOMETIMES INCENTIVIZE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE SEEING THINGS LIKE MORE VALUE BASED PAYMENT DISCUSSIONS AND AND EVERYTHING SO EVERYTHING'S HEADING IN OUR DIRECTION -- BUT THAT THE NEED IS STILL THERE SO THIS ARGUMENT AUGMENTATION FOR UP TO ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILLION PER YEAR. IN STATE DOLLARS IS NOT AND SHOULD NOT. BE JUST ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE RATES AS YOU WERE SAYING -- AS LOW AS THEY ARE. THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE THE OBJECTIVE IN THE MIND OF OUR AFFILIATES -- IT SHOULD BE ABOUT OUTCOMES FOR INCREASING CARE -- INCREASING CARE FOR THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDED IN THE ARAS OF THE HIGHEST NEED AND FOCUSING ON ADDITIONAL KERR WERE PATIENTS ARE ALREADY AND HEALTH CENTER -- SO THIS IS WHY OUR PROPOSAL SHIRT WITH DH CS -- WHICH WE APPRECIATE HAVING DISCUSSIONS -- HAS SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF PROVISIONS WHICH I'LL LET YOU ALL READ ABOUT -- OUR BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS IS JUST THAT THIS ALLOCATION IS FINE IT IN ITS FINAL FORM CAN BE DRAWN DOWN PRIMARILY BY TRUSTED PROVIDERS -- AND BELIEVE THAT OUR PROPOSAL REALLY ADDRESSES -- YOU KNOW A RANGE OF OPTIONS FOR THE FINAL -- DECISION AND ALSO TAKE SOME IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS INTO ACCOUNT -- AND SOME THOSE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF MAKING SURE THE MONEY FLOWS WELL -- ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH CENTERS SO -- WE LOOK FOR TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL ISSUES -- AND ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER NY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL NOW OR AT A LATER TIME. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SORRY SHE KNEW IF SHE REFUSED. TO GET HER HEAD. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE H. YES NO VALUE [inaudible] FINANCE. SO. SO I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF TH ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS HERE WHICH I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO GET INTO THE SPECIFICS -- BUT YOU DID MENTION THAT HE THAT -- HE WANTED. TO ENTER MEMBER YOU SAID AT THE END -- THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE BUT IT'S ABOUT THE FUN GOING IN THE MONEY GOING TO TRUSTED PROVIDERS. CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THE WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THERE YEAH I MEAN I THINK WE'RE YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN ENGAGING ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. OUT PART OF THE BUDGET HAVE -- A STRONG CONCERN AN INVESTMENT IN MAKING SURE WE HAVE -- COLD YOU KNOW BECAUSE CULTURALLY COMPETENT. PROVIDERS THAT ARE REALLY WANTING TO MAKE SURE LIKE FOR ALL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE EGGS. INVESTMENT -- THUS FAR HAS -- BEEN TO DO WHATEVER WORK FORCE -- ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO OPEN MORE HOURS EMPLOYMENT SLOTS AND WALK IN TIME ON WEEKENDS AND AND IN THE EVENING AND WE'RE SEEING IMMEDIATE DEMAND FOR THAT. A NOT AS SOMETHING THAT REALLY I THINK COMES FROM YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE THE TYPES OF PROVIDERS THAT HAVE. IT'S VERY MISSION BASED RIGHT IT'S A IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. THE THE THE FOLKS THAT ARE SERVED BY THE PROGRAMS THAT LARGELY FROM THE SERVICES RENDERED -- HAVE CERTAIN BARRIERS TO CARE AND AND OUR AFFILIATES AND A LOT OF OTHER HEALTH PROVIDERS IN OUR CLIP IN OUR TYPE. ARE -- ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT AND SO I THINK THAT'S AND ALSO YOU KNOW WANTING TO BE ABLE. TO QUANTIFY AND MEASURE AND SHARE THAT OUT -- I THINK IS -- IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD HOPE WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE -- THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING -- IN TERMS OF FEES IT AROUND THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE INTERVENTIONS -- BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A HEARING ON THE SEG CRISIS AND APPRECIATE THAT VERY HARD WORKER PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING -- MANY WHO ARE UNFORTUNATE UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERSTAFFED AND THE RECOGNIZING THAT TO TACKLE THAT CRISIS IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BOTH BETWEEN -- SORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO PRIVATE PROVIDERS -- LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND OTHERS WHO ARE PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH BUT THEN CAN ALSO HELP ON ON THE SUB PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ARE RELATED.

TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE PEACE ORGANIZATIONS ON BOARD AND DO THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU COME THIS MILIEU. FINANCE. THE STATE FROM DIFFICULT. ONE OKAY. OKAY I THINK THERE'S A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL -- REGARDING AMENDMENTS TO THE PACE MODERNIZATION ACT. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF PTO SO CAL PAYS WERE THE ASSOCIATION AND THE PROGRAMS OF ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY -- TO START WITH WE DO APPRECIATE THE STAFFING INCREASE WE DO -- I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT PART OF KEEPING UP WITH PACE GROWTH AND WE DO. APPRECIATE THE STATE SUPPORT FOR PACE -- IT IS A RAPIDLY GROWING MODEL OF CARE -- SHOWING GREAT PROMISE IN OUR COMMUNITY OF FRIEL SENIORS AN AT RISK ADULTS. OF THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR YOU IS AND WOULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY FOR PACE PACE IS A COMPREHENSIVE CARE PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW -- PEACE PROGRAMS ARE CAPITATED THEY'RE AT RISK FOR THE ENTIRE RANGE OF ACUTE CARE AND LONG TERM CARE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE BENEFICIARIES NEED. AND THAT PAYMENT DOESN'T CHANGE SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT PAYMENT TO BE -- SUPPORTIVE OF ALL THE THINGS THAT PACE DOES -- PACE OF BENEFITS REASON ROLLING PACE IN LIEU OF RICK SAVING ANY OTHER SERVICES AND FEE FOR SERVICE OR MEDICARE ALSO PACES ESSENTIALLY THEIR SOLE PROVIDER -- IS NOTED IN THE AGENDA THAT PACE MODERNIZATION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CHANGE THE METHODOLOGY. TO A MORE OF A EXPERIENCE BASTER COST BASED METHODOLOGY -- SHOULD SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT OUR DEPARTMENT IS PAYING MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE SUPPORTED THAT MOVE -- IN CONCEPT AND IT CERTAINLY CAN WORK FOR PACE BUT WE ARE FINDING SOME PROBLEMS WITH -- GETTING ALL THE COSTS RECOGNIZED -- THAT METHODOLOGY SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING THESE CHANGES -- EXAMPLES OF AREAS WERE HAVING PROBLEMS ARE IN THE AREA OF CAPITAL COSTS SO PEACE IS A CAPITAL INTENSIVE MODEL -- IT REQUIRES ME UP TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE TESTS TO START A PEACE CENTER -- IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT -- THERE'S REALLY NOTHING IN THE METHODOLOGY NO WAY TO RECOGNIZE THOSE COSTS AND ALLOW THEM TO BE RECOUPED IN A TIMELY WAY -- AND THE PROGRAMS -- YOU DO HAVE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS -- THE PROGRAM IS ALSO -- ON TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF RISK AND VOLATILITY BECAUSE IT'S COVERING EXCLUSIVELY NURSING HOME ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES THERE'S REALLY NO RISK SHARING OUR OUR SPRING I SHOULD SAY -- AMONG THE BENEFICIARIES LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A TRADITIONAL MANAGED CARE PLANS SO THERE'S A A NEED FOR A LITTLE BIT HIGHER MARGIN TO HANDLE THE THE VOLATILITY AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO NOT ACCOUNTED. FOR IN THE METHODOLOGY AND THEN FINALLY THE START UP PROGRAMS WHICH WERE SEEING MANY TAKE TAKE ON STARTING UP THE PROGRAM WHICH IS GREAT. BUT THE METHODOLOGY DOESN'T REALLY TAKE INTOACCOUNT THAT THEIR COST STRUCTURE IS HIGHER WHEN THEY START BECAUSE THEY HAVE HIGHER OVER -- OVER HIM OUT THERE SPREADING FIXED COSTS OVER A VERY SMALL. DAYS SO ANYWAY THE PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE METHODOLOGY WE THINK THE REASONABLE -- WE HAVE HAD SOME PROMISING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT I THINK WE MAY BE ON THE SAME PAGE ON SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE AND THE PROPOSAL BUT NOT ALL -- BUT I GUESS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVEN WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDING IF WE DO THIS SORT OF FLOOR FOR THE PAYMENTS -- THE PAYMENT STILL HAVE TO PEOPLE -- WITH THE STATE WOULD PAY FOR CARING FOR THESE TYPES OF BENEFICIARIES OUTSIDE OF PAYS SO IT'S STILL WALK A COST EFFECTIVE MODEL -- IN SO ANYWAY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING HOPEFULLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND WE HOPE WILL HAVE YOUR SUPPORT -- AT THE PROPER TIME. THANK YOU COMMENTS FROM THE BAR HAS SERVICES OKAY HELLO. FINANCE SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING RIGHT YEAH I THINK I WAS NOT IN THE MEETING I THINK THEY JUST MET WITH MY TEAM LIKE TWO DAYS AGO OR SOMETHING.

I WOULD KNOW WHAT IT IS AT A 75% FEDERAL MATCHING RATE SO IT'S A LOW GENERAL FUND COST. THIS REALLY IS RELATED TO A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING ON THE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT SIDE I MEAN JUST IN GENERAL BUT THE PROGRAM GROWING. ALWAYS MORE WORKLOAD FIGHT -- THE PROVIDER ROLE DIVISION ALSO HAS TAKEN OVER THE ENROLLMENT OF OUR DRUG MEDI CAL -- PROVIDERS AND AS WELL THE CURES ACT HAD SOME REQUIREMENTS AROUND -- MANAGED CARE MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS BEING IN ROLLED THROUGH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PROCESS AS FEE FOR SERVICE AND I THINK ORIGINALLY WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS THE IMPACT OF SECURES. OUR PLANS INITIALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD STILL DO THEIR OWN PROCESS AND THAT YOU KNOW AS LONG AS IT MET THE REQUIREMENTS -- BUT NOW WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE ALMOST ALL OF OUR PLANS OR AT LEAST HAVING SOME OF THEIR PROVIDERS AND ROLL THROUGH THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM SO IT'S REALLY CREATED A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. FOR US AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR JUST THESE LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO CLEAR TO CLEAR UP THAT BACKLOG. OKAY INCOMES MILIEU FINANCE. THE PUBLIC COMMENT ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD WELL ALWAYS.

THIS IS REALLY TO DO THE PROGRAM MONITORING SIDE ON THE ON THE CAR ABOUT PEACE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ACCURATE SEASON ARE TO USE YOU MAY BEGIN TO BE PROVIDING THE SERVICES. EXCELLENT. HELLO WE'VE REVIEWED THIS AND THE REMAINING -- ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND HAVE NO -- FOR DH CS AND HAVE NO CONCERNSOKAY TANK YOU FINANCE ALL RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY. YOU'LL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AS WELL. ALL RIGHT. ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN REAPPROPRIATION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MODERNIZATION RESOURCES FIRST AND THIS IS JUST A REAPPROPRIATION OF A OF A OF A REQUEST THAT WE'VE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. FOR THE CONSULTING RESOURCES THAT WE NEED TO COVER THE PLANNING COSTS OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DATA SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT -- THE EVERY ORIGINAL ACTIVITIES WERE DELAYED -- AS CMS WAS REQUIRING SOME ADDITIONAL PERF APPROVALS BEFORE WE COULD SECURE THE CONSULTING SERVICES SO NOW WE'RE READY TO MOVE FORWARD AND ARE ASKING THAT THAT MONEY BE RE APPROPRIATED FOR THAT PURPOSE. LA -- WE'RE GOOD FINANCE PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK FOR RE APPROPRIATE ALRIGHT. WE WILL PUT THAT ON OLD AS WELL. THE ONE MISSING ONE MISINTERPRET. BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF IT I OKAY ISSUE NINETEEN STRESSING PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ON AND MEDIC HOUSE. SURE SO THIS IS A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE -- A PROPOSAL THAT WAS REALLY DRIVEN OUT OF OUR INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE CAME INTO OFFICE ABOUT HIS DESIRE TO REALLY IMPROVE SERVICES FOR KIDS. IN MEDIC HOLLAND SO WE WERE TAKING A MORE COMPREHESIVE LOOK AT HOW COULD WE D ENHANCED COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT -- OF OUR HEALTH PLANS AND SO WE ARE ASKING -- FOR STAFF RESOURCES TWELVE PERMANENT NINE LIMITED TERM TO REALLY DO A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF IT ALREADY TODAY -- ONE IS ADDING ALL OF THE CHILD AND ADULT COURSE THAT MEASURES TO YOUR EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY SET -- I THINK AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WHEN I'M STUCK ON THE ON THE MEASURES WERE MEASURING AND HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE -- TO THEY DO THEY'RE DOING BETTER ON THESE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN. PARTICULARLY DOING THAT WELL -- AND SO WE WANT TO ADD ALL OF THE MEASURES AS A WAY TO HAVE ENHANCED COMPLIANCE MONITORING WE'RE ALSO DOING A COUPLE THINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE BENCH MARKS -- ONE WE ARE MOVING OUR MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL FROM THE TWENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE TO THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE -- SO THAT AGAIN THROUGH THE HIGHER BAR OF ACHIEVEMENTS FOR PLANS AND THEN -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS I COULD GEEK OUT ON SO I'M NOT I WON'T BUT I'LL JUST -- YOU KNOW I THINK QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MEASUREMENT. IN THE WAY THAT HE DOES DOES IT WITH THE PERCENTILES IS ALWAYS POTENTIALLY QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE YOU COULD BE TERRIBLE BUT STILL BE THE BEST OR YOU COULD BE REALLY GOOD BUT BE THE WORST -- AND I THINK THERE'S SOME PARTICULAR MEASURES IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THEM PARTICULARLY WITH SUCH AS YOU SCREENING AND OTHER THINGS FOR ADOLESCENTS WERE LIKE THE NATIONAL. THAT LIKE THE TOP IS 25% OF KIDS SO IT'S YOU KNOW WE DID THAT. SO WE WE REALLY WANTED SORT OF CHANGE HOW WERE HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE SO THERE ARE TWO I BELIEVE IT'S TWENTY THREE OF THE MEASURES. DO YOU HAVE NATIONAL BENCHMARKS JUST LIKE STREET BENCHMARKS -- I ALWAYS USE THIS WHEN I TOTALLY MAKE IT UP BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE BUT LIKE YOU KNOW 90% OF KIDS TO GET YOU KNOW IT UP HIGH ACHIEVEMENT IS 90% OF KIDS GETTING ALL THEIR IMMUNIZATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE BUT I USE. IT AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN THINK OF SO WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE SETTING THOSE STANDARDS AND HOLDING PLANS NOT JUST TO THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE MPO BUT FOR THOSE MEASURES FOR WHICH STANDARDS EXIST. THAT ARE YOU KNOW PROVEN TO BE APPROPRIATE WE WILL BE HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE AS WELL -- AND AGAIN I IT MY TEAM KNOWS BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS I'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT HOW QUALITY MEASUREMENT HAS ALWAYS DRIVEN ME CRAZY FROM A MATHEMATICAL PERSPECTIVE. JUST THAT THAT YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOOD -- MISS SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OUR ARE THERE OTHER WAYS THAT A STANDARDIZED BENCHMARKS CAN BE ADDED FOR THE REST OF THE MEASURES -- BUT JUST STARTING WITH THE ONES FOR WHICH-THEY EXIST TODAY -- EDITION ONLY -- HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS WHEN A PLAN HAS NOT BEEN MEETING ITS PERFORMANCE LEVELS HAS THE FIRST STEP IS ALWAYS BEEN A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. WHERE WE WORK WITH THE PLAN -- AND DO A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROVIDE MILESTONES THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET AND THEN ONLY IF THEY DON'T. COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE MILESTONES DID WE SANCTION THE HEALTH PLANS -- ON ON THE ON THESE QUALITY MEASURES -- WE HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND NOW WITH WITH THESE HIGHER -- STANDARDS THAT IF A PLAN IS IS FAILING TO MEET THOSE STANDARDS WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ISSUE A SANCTION AND TO DO THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. THAT COULD LEAD TO FUTURE SECTIONS -- AGAIN WE WE HAVE FOUND AND I THINK WE HAVE SEEN -- AS WE HAVE SORT OF IN MORE RECENT YEARS BEEN USING THE SANCTION TOOL THAT IT HAS DRIVEN CHANGE IN A FASTER WAY THAN WE'VE BEEN SEEING WHEN WE WEREN'T DOING IT -- SO WE THINK IT IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WE SHOULD BE USING -- MORE APPROPRIATELY AND MORE OFTEN -- THE OTHER THINGS WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT REMOVING THE THE CAPS SURVEY FROM EVERY THREE YEARS TO EVERY TWO YEARS AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DOING SO WE DO WE ALREADY HAVE OUR REPORTS THAT WE DO FROM ARE YOU CURL AND WE HAVE. OUR QUARTERLY DASHBOARDS BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT NOW WITH THESE INCREASED A WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF MEASURES SORT OF A A MORE ROBUST ANNUAL COMPLIANCE REPORTS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SO THAT FOLKS COULD SEE A HEALTH PLAN PERFORMANCE SORT OF INDIVIDUALLY ON ALL OF THESE. MEASURES. OKAY THANK YOU OHIO FINANCE HELLO. AND I APPRECIATE -- WH WHAT -- YOUR PRESENTATION AND WHAT YOU SAID -- A SOMEONE WHO ALSO DID WORK AND QUALITY PRE. FOR I WE GOT IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I MEAN I THINK THE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WAS QUITE DISMAYING. RIGHT AND CERTAINLY IS A PEDIATRICIAN.

THIS. I MEAN THIS IS SO CORE I MEAN THIS IS NOT ONE OF THESE -- IT'S A NEW MEASURE WE'RE STILL FIGURING IT OUT KIND OF THING I MEAN THIS IS A STANDARD THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

DO YOU BE WITH ME ON THAT END WITH YOU ON THAT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO RIGHT -- AND DOES COME UP WITH BEST PRACTICES AND SO FORTH BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT ALSO IS THAT YOU SIGNED UP TO DO THIS YOU SHOULD ARRAY OF KNOWING HOW TO DO THIS -- NOW YOU COULD COULD YOU DO BETTER YEAH WE YOU AND MAYBE LEARN HOW TO DO BETTER BUT YOU SHOULD BE STARTING OFF LIKE -- I DIDN'T DO VERY WELL TO START WITH.

THAT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY WE REALLY SERVE TWO MAJOR FUNCTIONS FOR THE ST ONE WE HAVE OUR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WHICH OVERSEES THE REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY MEASURES FOR OVER TEN THOUSAND FACILITIES. IN THIRTY DIFFERENT FACILITY TYPES. THE OTHER MAIN FUNCTION FOR CC QUEUE IS OUR HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS PROGRAM THAT REALLY FOCUSES MORE ON EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. OF HEALTH CARE -- ACQUIRED INFECTIONS AND WORKS WITH INFECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION AND NURSES. SO FOR THIS YEAR FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT AND WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATED.

THIRTY OF AN INCREASE OF TEN POINT TWO MILLION OR THREE POINT EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT FOR BUDGET YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY CCQ ESTIMATES EXPENDITURES WILL TOTAL THREE HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF THIRTY POINT THREE MILLION OR TEN POINT 8% COMPARED. TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. AS FOR NOVEMBER ESTIMATE OVERVIEW. RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING BASICALLY A DEEP DIVE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN DECEMBER WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT -- PROCESSES OUR FIRST GOAL IS TO STREAMLINE ALL OF OUR PROCESSES INFUSE TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN HAVING MANUAL AND AND PAPER PROCESSES INTO OUR AN EXISTING REGULATORY FUNCTIONS AND LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION. BUT AFTER WE DO THAT DEEP DIVE AFTER WE LOOK AT THE STREAMLINE WE WANTED TO JUST LET YOU BE AWARE FOR THE NOVEMBER ESTIMATE THAT WERE ALSO PROBABLY GONNA BE LOOKING AT A FIFTY SIX POINT FIVE HEALTH FACILITY BELL THE CITY'S.

SO AS OF MARCH THIRTY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN SEATS ACCUSE OVERALL VACANCY RATE HAS DROPPED DOWN TO SIX POINT 2%. AND HEAVEN VACANCY RATE IS NOW FOUR POINT 2% WE'RE CONTINUING TO DROP THOSE VACANCY RATES EACH MONTH -- AS FOR ITEM NUMBER. THREE AND ONE IN AN UPDATE ON OUR IS OUR MOST CURRENT TIMELINE METRICS. AND WIN POSTED OUR QUARTER ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN METRICS FOR TIMELY COMPLETION OF LONG TERM CARE COMPLAINTS WILL SHOW THAT CCQ COMPLETED 77% OF COMPLAINTS RECEIVED AFTER JULY FIRST IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. THIS COMPARES WITH THE FORMER -- EVALUATION TOOL WHICH IS WAS NINETY DAYS WE USED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 82% PERCENTAGE COMPLETION RATE -- WITH A NINETY DAY TRADER BUT NOW THAT WE'RE MOVING DOWN TO THE SIXTY DAY METRIC THAT IS SHIFTED A BIT. THIS IS A VERY SLIGHT DECREASE IN PERFORMANCE IN THE TIMELY FOR COMPLETION -- HOWEVER SEE TO CARE RIGHT NOW AS I SAID WE'RE UNDERGOING -- ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF ALL OF OUR COMPLAINT PROCESSES AND WORKING ON ONE SET STANDARDIZE WAY THAT WE WILL HAVE COMPLAINTS REVIEWS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. AND L. A. L. [inaudible] FINANCE -- SO. FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE -- YOU STARTED IN DECEMBER. RIGHT CONGRATULATIONS -- THIS IS THE AREA IS A DEPARTMENT THAT SAID SOME CHALLENGES -- SO I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT THE VACANCY RATE IS -- I GUESS WAY DOWN ACTUALLY -- WHEN I REMEMBER ATTENDING A MEETING OR -- AND LOTS OF ACTING FOLKS AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK THERE WAS -- SEEM LIKE MORALES PRE POORER AND THINGS ARE TOTALLY BACKLOG LOTS OF EXCUSES FOR REASONS THINGS ONE I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S A TWENTY FOURTEEN L. OUT AND ALL THAT STUFF SO -- AND PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON YOUR DEPARTMENT TO KEEP THEM SAFE SO -- AND THEN TELL YOUR LOTS VACANCIES IN TURNOVER SO. HAD TO SEE THAT -- YOU'RE LOOKING INTO THIS I MEAN THAT CERTAINLY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE THEN ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THINGS CAN STILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. A A A A I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- I MEAN TERMS OF YOUR OBSERVATION OF THIS DEPARTMENT. BUT SONY PARTICULARLY -- I MEAN WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- THIS AT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY AS YOU POINTED OUT AS AS YOU POINTED OUT -- HAS REALLY. BEEN UNDERGOING A LOT OF CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT WERE OCCURRING IN THE LOW MORALE AND THE HIGH VACANCY RATES AN OLD BACKLOGS OF COMPLAINTS. AND SO THIS IS IT AN AREA THAT OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN EXPECT -- TO SEE LIKE DRASTIC CHANGES FROM ONE CORNER TO THE NEXT BUT WE'LL YOU KNOW WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE TRENDS OVER TIME AND AS AS SOME OF THESE NEW PROCEDURES ARE EMPLOYEES AND AS THE ELLIE THE NEW ELLIE A PERFORMANCE BASED CONTRACT -- IS IN PLACE YOU KNOW WILL BE CONTINUING TO WATCH THOSE TRENDS OVER TIME. ALL RIGHT -- WE DO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL -- ORGANIZATION FEELS IT WILL ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF HOSPITAL INSPECTIONS AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. UNDER CURRENT LAW CV PH IS MANDATED TO DEPLOY A HOSPITAL INSPECTORS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE INSPECTIONS OF HOSPITALS FOR UNSPECIFIED PURPOSES. JUNE THESE INSPECTIONS ARE INTENDED FOR INSPECTORS TO MAKE FINDINGS AS WELL AS RESPOND TIMELY AND PROPERLY TO ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING THE INSPECTION PROCESS. HOWEVER AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS THE PRESENCE OF MANAGEMENT DURING THESE INSPECTIONS HAD HAS HAD A STIFLING EFFECT ON HOSPITAL PERSONNEL. OFTENTIMES INTIMIDATING PERSONNEL SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE DETERRED FROM PROVIDING MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES AND POTENTIALLY REGULATORY. VIOLATIONS. THEREFORE AS NOTED AND SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA WE LIKE TO RESPECT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO AMEND SECTION -- ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT POINT FIVE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES OF ENTITIES INSPECTED BY THE PH TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISCUSS. POSSIBLE REGULATORY VIOLATIONS ARE PATIENTS SEEKING CONCERNS WITH INSPECTOR PRIVATELY DURING THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION OR INSPECTION BY DPH. ALSO AS NOTED THIS PROVISION WOULD -- BE CONSISTENT WITH LABOR SECTION SIX THREE ONE FOUR WHICH ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH INSPECTORS -- AT THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OR OSHA. UNDER EXISTING LAW IF CAL OSHA INSPECTOR COMES INTO THE HOSPITAL TO CONDUCT AN INSPECTION. THE NURSE THE NURSES AND OTHER PERSONNEL CAN ASK TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH THAT INSPECTOR. BUT IF A DPH INSPECTOR COMES INTO THE SAME HOSPITAL FOR INSPECTION THE SAME EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE THAT SAME RIGHT TO SPEAK PRIVATELY. WE'RE SIMPLY SEEKING PARITY AND CONSISTENCY UNDER THE LAW THE PRESENCE OF MANAGEMENT DURING THESE INSPECTIONS HAS NO CORRELATION TO IMPROVE QUALITY OR OUTCOMES -- HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON PERSONNEL AND IF ANYTHING HAS ONLY RESULTED IF ANYTHING HAS ONLY RESULTED IN THE EMISSION OF POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES PERSONNEL MAY SEEK TO HAVE ADDRESSED. WE ALSO FEEL AS THOUGH ADOPTING THESE PROVISIONS WILL POTENTIALLY IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AS INSPECTORS WILL GET A MORE ACCURATE DEPICTION. OF WHAT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ARE AT THE END GIVEN HOSPITAL. WHICH ME ALSO LIKELY RESULT IN CURBING THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL OR FOLLOW UP INSPECTIONS BEEN CONDUCTED BY DPH -- PROMPTED BY PERHAPS ANONYMOUS CALLS FROM HOSPITAL PERSONNEL FOR EXAMPLE OR OR OTHERWISE. WE PREACHER CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN ADOPTING TRADING TRAINER BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD HELP IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INSPECTIONS. AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BY ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO SPEAK. UP PRIVATELY WITH CV PH INSPECTORS JUST LIKE CAL OSHA EMPLOYEES ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH INSPECTORS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT MATTER THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM C. PH YES CITY PH M. HAS NO ISSUE WITH THIS TRAILER LANGUAGE. OKAY THANK YOU. ELIA [inaudible] FINANCE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN A COPY OF THE TRAILER BOWLING WHICH I HAVE NO POSITION AT THIS TIME OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE THE PROPOSAL AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- TELL YOU AS A RESIDENCY DIRECTOR ON WEDNESDAY ACCREDITATION BODY CAME BY TO DO THEIR REVIEW -- THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO TALK TO THE RESIDENCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE FACULTY PRESENT AND THAT WAS ALL RIGHT -- AND I HAD NO FEAR OF THAT. BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT INSPECTORS HAVE AND THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO INSPECT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THEY HEAR SOMETHING AND THEY'LL POSSIBLES THERE'S A DISGRUNTLED PLAY BUT THEY ONCE BACKED AND THEN THEY'LL SEE WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT THEY'LL STATE BUT THEY'LL HAVE A LEAD. TO FOLLOW UP ON AND THEY AND THEY CAN JUDGE BUT WE DON'T WANT IS WE DON'T WANT THINGS BEING HIDDEN AND WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE TOLD WELL YOU YOU CAN MEET AND SO FORTH SO WE WANT TO HELP THE INSPECTORS THAT INSPECTORS DO THEIR JOB. GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED THEY CAN SORT OUT THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF IF THERE'S ANY IF THERE'S ANY CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT. BUT APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT. OKAY WITH THAT I'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THIS -- ITEM SO WE HAVE THIS IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL SO THE OVERALL CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY LACING CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THE COLORS OKAY WELCOME. SENATOR PAN BARBER GLASER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I'M NOT A 100% SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO BRING THIS UP BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH -- LICENSING FEES OF C. H. A. HAS CONCERNS ABOUT THE RATE AT WHICH LICENSING FEES ARE INCREASING -- THIS IS THE SIXTH YEAR IN A ROW THAT AN INCREASE IS BEING PROPOSED IT'S WORKING OUT TO BE ABOUT 20% EVERY YEAR AND IN LA COUNTY IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HIGHER. SO OUR FEES NOW ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 50% MORE THAN THEY WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND WE'RE JUST CONCERNED -- IF THIS RATE CONTINUES TO INCREASE WHETHER THAT'S A SUSTAINABLE RATE OR NOT IT'S IT'S REALLY ADDING TO THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. AN IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL QUALITY I KNOW THAT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO RIGHT SIZE -- BUT THESE FEES JUST KEEP GOING OUT UP QUITE A BIT EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THEREFORE WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS YEAR'S P. INCREASE. OKAY. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR MARKER FOR THAT SO THIS IS -- CAN KEEP CAN YOU JUST. I REALIZE FEES RIGHT VERY ON SIZE INSTITUTION I MEAN CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT KIND OF SCALE OF FEES WERE TALKING ABOUT FOR A HIGH I GUESS A TYPICAL HOSPITAL AND OTHER SUCH THING AS A TYPICAL HOSPITAL BUT YEAH THAT'S IT THAT IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION I WAS HAVING. THIS CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE THE OTHER DAY BUT I THINK -- I WAS LOOKING AT OPERATING MARGINS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ABOUT. NEGATIVE OPERATING MARGIN IN SO IT'S THOSE HOSPITALS THAT ARE GOING TO FEEL THIS AND IT MAIL IT MAY BE A TWENTY THOUSAND OR THIRTY THOUSAND INCREASE BUT IT'S HAPPENING EVERY YEAR NOW. AND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT'S EVEN GREATER FOR HOSPITAL THAT'S NOT I MEAN IT'S DOING PRETTY WELL FINANCIALLY IT'S NOT AS BIG A DEAL BUT IT'S FOR THOSE OTHER HOSPITALS. WHERE BASICALLY? ANY KIND OF P. INCREASES CAN IMPACT THEM NEGATIVELY SO IT'S I I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OKAY ALL RIGHT NO PREACH AND JUST TO SCAN A SENSE OF SCALE SO OVER THAT THAT HELPS ME SEE TWENTY THOUSAND HERE TO USE. THE RIGHT. WAY YES. JENNIFER CENTER MAY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND AGAIN IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE BAR PLEASE WITH THE COMPANY POSSIBLE CESSATION WE WE WE WANT TO BRING UP. SOME OF OUR CONCERNS RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN LICENSING FEES OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME SINCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU WERE LOOKING FOR SOME EXAMPLES OF KIND OF A A DIFFERENTIAL -- BACK IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN NURSING FACILITIES WERE ASSESSED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE DOLLARS PER BED -- IN LA COUNTY IN PARTICULAR NOW THAT PROPOSED THIS YEAR -- PER BED IT'LL BE OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IS SO THAT'S JUST SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN OF FOUR FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE -- IT'S RISEN FROM THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE DOLLARS UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS PER BED SO -- YOU CAN SEE THE EXPONENTIAL INCREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE NEW NEW LEADERSHIP -- AT THE CENTER -- AND VERY MUCH -- ENJOY THE THE DISCUSSIONS AND THAT AND THAT COOPER ABILITY WE HAVE BUT JUST CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED WITH THAT EXPONENTIAL INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN LICENSING FEES AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE AWARE OF THAT. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELCOME I AM A SUCKER DATA WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA AND ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBERS WHO WORK FOR BOTH THE STATE AS WELL AS ELLIE COUNTY AS HEALTH FACILITY INSPECTION PERSONNEL -- WE SUPPORT THE STATE'S PROPOSALS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS AT THE LA -- MADE -- WE'VE BEEN UNDERGOING A KIND OF A LONG REACH TRANSFORMATION PROCESS -- AND I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IT STARTS PRIOR TO EVEN WHEN THE SOME OF THOSE INITIAL CHANGES STARTED IN BAD BUDGET YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HELD OFF ON OR OR I THINK EVEN LOWERED SOME OF THESE FEES FOR HOSPITALS BECAUSE WE WERE CUTTING THEM SO SEVERELY ON THE MEDICAL. SIDE -- AND THERE WAS JUST THERE IS SORT OF THIS UNDERSTANDING DURING THE BAD BUDGET YEARS THAT WE NEEDED TO NOT GO THERE BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INTERVENING TIME IS. THE PROGRAM CONTINUED TO GROW AND WE STARTED TO SEE PEOPLE SUFFER -- THERE WERE DEATHS THEY WERE REALLY BAD QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR EVERY HUMANS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES AND SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT -- WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT PROGRESS IS TIED TO TANGIBLE OUTCOMES AND METRICS THAT THE LEGISLATURES TRACKING THANKS TO THAT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE -- WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT THE CNA PROPOSAL -- IT AND AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT -- THEY SAID IN THEIR STATEMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL CERTAINLY WE WANT TO TRY TO KEEP AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF FEES BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THAT IS A COST BUT ALSO OF COURSE WE NEED TO SUPPORT A REQUEST AND EFFECTIVE. INSPECTION SYSTEM TO ENSURE SAFETY SO. SO GO TO WORK AT THAT AND PLEASE SEE THE TERROR HAVE BEEN NOW CERTAINLY SIGNIFICANT MISSING EVERY IMPROVEMENT SINCE I HAD. TO JUST AS BEFORE AND SO APPRECIATE HAVING LEADERSHIP NOW -- THIS AT THE TIME THERE WASN'T EVEN COULD NAIL THOSE INSTABILITY EVEN AT THE TOP AND SO -- BUT ALSO HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT THIS WERE MOVING FORWARD -- NOT CONTINUING HAVE TO INCREASE THE INSPECTION COSTS BUT WE WANT WE WANT YOU TO THE RIGHT SIZE RIGHT. NOT TOO HIGH NOT TOO LOW THE RIGHT SIZE SO I'M SURE YOU'LL FIGURE THAT OUT. OKAY SO THE NEXT. ITEM IS WELL WE PEOPLE MADE REFERENCE TO IT LOS ANGELES. ALL RIGHT ISSUE THREE LOS ANGELES COUNTY CONTRACT. SO I'M GONNA DO IS THREE AS GOVERNOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY OF NINETEEN TWENTY THIRTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FROM FUND. THREE NINETY EIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL WATER CITY TO EACH OF THE M. POSITIONS NURSE POSITIONS. AND NINETY FIVE SUPPORT STAFF -- COMPANY THOSE NERVES POSITIONS -- THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT THE GOAL OF HIS PCP IS TO PROVIDE FULL FUNDING FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO ASSUME. THE THE ABILITY TO COMPLETE ALL THEIR WORKLOAD ALL THE COMPLAINTS OLDER BACKLOGS OVERTIME WE SURVEYS -- WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE ARE NEARING THE CONCLUSION OF OUR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IT'S BEEN A VERY FRUITFUL A CONVERSATION THIS LAST NINE MONTHS OR SO -- WE'VE EXCHANGED DOCUMENTS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN US IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE NEARING THE STAGES OF SIGNING THE DOCUMENTS GOING FORWARD -- WE FULLY EXPECT THAT WE'LL HAVE A SIGNED CONTRACT IN PLACE BY JULY ONE A PART OF OUR CONVERSATION WITH THEM. ON THE ON OUR SIDE IS WE'LL ALSO BE TAKING ONE OF OUR EXISTING POSITIONS AND DEDICATING IT TO TO REALLY A CONTRACT MONITORING OF THE RELATIONSHIP. TO HELP FOSTER THE ROUTE THE THE GIVE AND TAKE IN THE DISCUSSIONS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN OUR TWO DEPARTMENTS A SLEW CAN REALLY EFFECTIVELY MONITOR AND LOOK AT THE CONTRACT DELIVERABLES HELLO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME OTHER THAN TO NOTE THAT -- AS WE REVIEWED THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL -- WE JUST NOTE THAT SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTOR -- STILL UNCLEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDERGOING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS IS SORT OF HARD TO ASSESS WHETHER -- YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO ASSESS THE THE QUALITY OF THOSE MEASURES -- AND ALSO NOTE THAT -- OVERALL THE THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY IS NOT REQUESTING ANY NEW. POSITIONS AT THE STATE. LEVEL BUT PRESUMABLY -- THE ADDITION OF OF WORK FORCE IN LA COUNTY WILL FREE UP SOME OF THE STATE WORKERS DO THE WORKLOAD DOWN THERE NOW. SO -- THE CENTER HAS INDICATED THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF STATE WORKLOAD -- TO BE ABSORBED BY IT BY THOSE FOLKS -- BUT THAT'S JUST AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE KEEPING AN EYE ON TO SEE. HOW IT AFFECTS THE RATE SIZING OF THE? OF THE CENTER -- AND FEES ARE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WERE KEEPING AN EYE ON GIVEN THE THE SORT OF RAPID INCREASE IN FEES PARTICULARLY IN LA COUNTY GIVEN THE APPROVAL GIVEN LAST YEAR TO ASSESS A SUPPLEMENTAL FEE THERE. WE'RE NOT SURE THAT IT -- YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT WE EXPECT THE FEES WILL SORT OF STABILIZE ONCE ONCE THE CENTER AND LA COUNTY OF KIND OF REACHED A YOU KNOW PROPER A STAFFING LEVEL BUT ANYWAYS JUST TO KNOW THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THE ISSUES THAT OUR OFFICE IS KEEPING AN EYE. ON BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT THE PUZZLE. ALL RIGHT FINANCE. HEY YEAH I MEAN WE WE SELL. IT YEAH YEAH YOU STILL PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING SELL THE GETTING CLOSE. THE QUESTION IS GOING TO BE A YOU KNOW WHAT THE FEE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN LA COUNTY SINCE. AND THE REST OF THE STATE AND THEN AT WHAT POINT IS THIS THOUGH IS THAT THE THERE'S A STABILIZER SO WE HAVE. SO YOU'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO DO THAT BUT ALSO SINCE YOUR CONTRACT WITH THE LA COUNTY WHEN. IS THE IS THE HOUSE THAT BUILT INTO THE CONTRACT RIGHT I MEAN IS THIS A STRAIGHT LINE EVERYTHING KEEPS GOING UP CONTRACTORS OR SOME POINT. THAT IT'S GONNA LEVEL THE THE THE ZONE IT AGAIN WE HEARD ABOUT FEES. FOR SO I I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE I DON'T HAVE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT YET OR NOT SO OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE FIRST YOU'RE AUGMENTATION THEY WERE BUILDING IT INTO THE SHOW'S FEES. IS IS THE THREE YEAR CONTRACT AS OF THE HIRE MORE STAFF OF THE OLD POLICY BE. INCREASES BY THE END OF YOUR THREE THOUGH WE'RE HOPING THAT IT WILL BE MORE OR LESS A THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE THE COOL EFFECTS OF OF SALARY INCREASES AND WHATNOT SO -- WE'RE HOPING TO ESTABLISH THE RIGHT METRICS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY STAFF. ACTUALLY NEEDS TO PERFORM THE WORKLOAD AND THEN DEPENDING IF MORE WERE COMES IN -- YOU KNOW CMS GIVES US MORE WORK TO DO OTHER SOME UP TICK IN THE NUMBER OF SLEAZE -- COMING INTO -- OPERATIONS THAT MIGHT DRIVE ADDITIONAL OF POSITIONS BUT THERE SHOULD BE A LEVELING OFF AFTER YOUR THREE OKAY. US ALL RIGHT. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT DEGREE FOR NURSING HOMES -- WERE THE MAIN PAIR. SELLS THE FEES GO UP I'M NOT SURE WE'RE PAYING AT THE OTHER END [inaudible] BECAUSE AFTER HOTEL THEY PAY FOR THEIR FEES BY WHAT WE PAY THEM TO CERTAIN EXTENT NOW AT LEAST EIGHTY ROUTE 80% I THINK SO. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGELA BLOWN LIME DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PICK UP THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN LA COUNTY. AND WE WANT TO START OF COURSE BY THANKING THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSAL TO INCREASE FUNDING IN OUR CONTRACT WITH ST DPH WERE ALSO VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP AT THE AT THE DEPARTMENT -- WE ON WE WHO ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. LA COUNTY AS I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HAS BEEN CONTRACTED BY THE STATE TO PERFORM THESE INSPECTIONS. IN ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FACILITIES IN IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES -- THERE WAS AT ONE POINT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR FOURTEEN AS YOU MENTIONED MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT. A POOR PERFORMANCE NOT ONLY IN LA COUNTY BUT STATE WIDE. THERE WAS A RIGHT SIZING OF THE PROGRAM IN LA COUNTY BOY WHAT THAT RIGHT SIZING DID IS IT IT FUNDED US SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE ON ABOUT 60% OF THE WORKLOAD. AND DOT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING OVER THE COURSE OF THIS NEW CONTRACT IS TO GRADUALLY TRANSITION ALL OF THE WORKLOAD IN LA COUNTY. TO THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND THAT'S THE UP THE BASIS FOR THIS. AS OF SCOTT MENTIONED IT THE LEVELING OFF WILL OCCUR IN IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THAT CONTRACT AND THEN WE'RE SUBJECT TO JUST ANNUAL COST INCREASES. LET ME JUST SAY A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WITH SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. ACTUALLY WOULD SUPPORT OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE THE COUNTY DID. MAKE THAT INCREASE THAT I MENTION THAT RIGHT SIZE I THINK WE'VE COVERED THAT AND THE PROGRAM GREW FROM A FOUR THE PROGRAM WHEN IT'S FULLY. CAPABLE OF ASSUMING THE FULL WORKLOAD IN LA COUNTY WILL GROW BY ABOUT ANOTHER 50% SO WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH HERE. BUT JUST AS WE WERE ABLE TO PERFORM VERY WELL IN MET ALL OF OUR EXPECTATIONS ON THE LAST CONTRACT WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THE SAME WITH THIS NEW CONTRACT -- WE'RE FINALIZING THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AS WAS SAID THE CONTRACT SPECIFIES METRICS. FOR A HOW TO MEASURE THE COUNTY'S PERFORMANCE IN THREE AREASTHE QUALITY OF OUR WORK THE QUANTITY OF OUR WORK AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. THERE IS ALSO A PROVISION THERE THAT IF THE COUNTY DOESN'T EET ANY OF THE ANY OF THE TARGETS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED. ALTHOUGH WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT THERE IS AN ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO WITHHOLD SOME OF THE FUNDING IF WE DO NOT MEET THOSE TARGETS. FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE BACKLOG BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND DOUBT MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE HAVE SHARED WITH WITH OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENT. THAT GROWING BACKLOG HOW WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THAT IS THAT THE CONTRACT PROVIDES -- FOR SUFFICIENT FUNDING SO THAT IN TERMS OF NEW COMPLAINTS THEY WILL ALL BE OB RESOLVED IN THE TIME FRAMES THAT ARE SPECIFIED. AND NO NEW COMPLAINT THAT'S RECEIVED WILL GO BEYOND THE YEAR THAT IT'S RECEIVED BEFORE ITS RESULTS SO THAT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH NO GROWTH IN THE IN THE BACKLOG. AND THEN NOT WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTING BACKLOG THAT WILL BE CUT IN HALF AT THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR AND THEN WE IN THE STATOR TALKING ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THAT FINAL PUSH. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ITEM IS GONNA BE HELD OPEN TODAY BUT WE REQUEST YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES OUGHT TO APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IN UPCOMING HEARINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

NOW WE CARRY OUT ON A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS -- WE ALSO PROVIDE AND DISPENSE MEDICATIONS TO PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM FOR ON SOME OF THE CHRONIC COM AFFECTIONS. BUT I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY TIME WITH YOU TODAY TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE MISSILE SITUATION I KNOW THAT'S AN ITEM OF INTEREST TO YOU. OUR IS SO THAT'S OKAY WITH OU WILL TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES JUST -- TO FILL YOUR WHAT IS STILL HAPPENING. AS YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE -- BEEN EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MEASLES CASES IN CALIFORNIA -- JUST FROM LAST WEEK TO THIS WEEK AND WE SAW AN INCREASE OF FIFTEEN CASES WE NOW HAVE. THIRTY EIGHT CASES ARE IN CALIFORNIA. THOSE CASES ARE ALL ON YOU SOME FORM RELATED TO TRAVEL -- WE HAVE ON A FIFTEEN OF THOSE CASES DIRECTLY THEMSELVES TRAVELED TO INTERNATIONAL LAW THIS THE NATION'S -- IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS INITIALS OF TRAVEL HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN GOING ON THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE ARE. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION REALLY LARGE OUTBREAKS. OF THE WORLD INCLUDING THE UKRAINE AND INCLUDE IN THE PHILIPPINES. HI AND THOSE ARE AREAS THAT -- CALIFORNIA TRAVELERS FREQUENT ON QUITE A LOT. SO ARE RETURNING TRAVELERS FROM THOSE AREAS AND A FEW OTHERS -- HAVE ON HAVE RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN -- INFECTED OTHER CALIFORNIANS HERE -- WE HAVE HOT ON OR WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FOUR OUTBREAKS SO FAR IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. WE HAVE A ONE WE HAD ONE SMALL OUTBREAK IN THE BAY AREA THAT IS CONTROLLED. WE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT OUTBREAK IN BUTTE COUNTY. THAT NOW HOUSES ON NINETEEN CASES AND THAT'S ALL FOR ONE SINGLE TRAVELER WHO. EFFECT AT ALL THERE SO ALL OTHERS EFFECTED OTHERS. WE HAVE -- SMALL OUTBREAK IN -- LA AND ONE IN SACRAMENTO. HI END SO THAT APARTMENT HOUSE AROUND TOP OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REST RESPOND AGGRESSIVELY -- WE BELIEVE THAT GIVEN THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD AS A FEW SECONDARY CASES AS WE HAVE IS A GOOD TESTAMENT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TRAVELERS WHO HAVE EFFECTED NO -- ONE AND THAT'S NOT BUT COINCIDENCE THINK OF A PART OF THAT IS THERE HIGH RATES OF IMMUNIZATION THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP. NOW IN CALIFORNIA ALL ABOUT 95% OF FROM SCREEN -- KINDERGARTNERS COP THAT COUPLED WITH OUR VERY SWEET PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION IN CONTAINING EXPOSURES IN AND AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE GET TREATED ON VACCINATED HUSBAND QUITE SUCCESSFUL. NONE THE LESS WE HAVE ACTIVATED OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM -- AND TODAY WE ACTUALLY HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE MEDIA -- AND SO I THINK TONIGHT YOU WILL SEE ON THE NEWS QUITE A LOT OF NEWS. ABOUT THAT OUR MAIN POINT HAS BEEN TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS THAT TRAVEL OVERSEAS. I INSURED OTHER FULLY VACCINATED. ANA AND SO THAT'S BEEN OUR MISS ME MESSAGE COUPLE BY A MESSAGE THAT IF YOU'RE TRAVELING YOU'RE SICK. I MAKE SURE TO CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER NOT BASE IN THE E. R. -- VISITED THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND GET SOME INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT TO DO AND DON'T EXPOSE OTHERS. TO THINK THAT'S AN UPDATE ON ME SO SOME OF YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS WE CAN CONTINUE. THANK YOU ACTUALLY THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I KNOW I ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION ABOUT. THE OUTBREAK IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND I KNOW THAT PART OF THE RESPONSE WAS THAT YOU KNOW. WHEN THERE'S AN OUTBREAK YOU'RE JUST TOO BUSY RIGHT TO SIT THERE AND? KEEP A TALLY ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME PEOPLE ARE SPENDING ON ARE YOU -- GIVEN BY THE TIME THE CASE IS NOW 383-8 CASES. ARE YOU TRACKING THE COST OF THE ALL THE WORK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OUTBREAKS HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING THE STATE HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING THE VARIOUS COUNTIES -- TO DO THIS THE THE NATURE OF THE FACT THAT. WE WE HAD A HEARING BEFORE THAT PERSONNEL BEING PULLED OFF OF THE REGULAR TASKS. TO OTHER DO OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS. TO DEAL WITH THE THESE OUTBREAKS -- CAN CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK A LITTLE BIT. TO THE THE COST OF THE OVER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON WITH THE TO BE BUDGETING MONEY FOR THIS NOW. CORRECT SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND HE'S NOT JUST THE THE THIRTY EIGHT CASES ON IT IS THAT EVERYONE OF THOSE CASES RESULT IN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF EXPOSURES. ARE FREQUENTLY IN AIRPLANES -- IN DIFFERENT VENUES THOUGHT CALIFORNIA FROM SHOPPING CENTERS. TO MALLS TO JAMS AND SO EVERYONE OF THOSE EXPOSURES HAS TO BE CONTACTED. BY A PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER AND PROVIDE AN INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT TO DO AND FREQUENTLY THOSE ARE VERY. DIFFICULT TO THE WE HAVE TAKEN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS VERY SERIOUSLY AND JUST YESTERDAY WE HOT. ON ALL COUNTY CALLED WHERE WE BASICALLY A TALL FOLKS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ON OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM HERE'S THE UPDATE ON MISSILES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY IS ASKING EVERYONE OF THOSE FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO HELP US KEEP TRACK OF THE COSTS DURING CURRENT -- IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO THEM TO NOT JUST KEEPING TRACK OF COSTS FOR MEASLES CASES ABOUT ANYTHING THAT THEY DO RELATED TO MEASLES OR INTO. A DIFFERENT A RESPONSE SO DOCTORS MADE HERSELF WAS AT THE MEETING AND SHE MADE A PLEA. THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND WE HAVE FORMED A GROUP THAT WOULD BE MEETING REGULARLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING. THANK YOU -- BECAUSE THE WE TALKED ABOUT THE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND IF GOING -- TO KNOW WHAT RESOURCES WE NEED FOR THAT AND WE NEED TO HAVE. THE CAPACITY. TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE OUTBREAKS -- IDEALLY WE CAN PREVENT THEM THAT'S WHY WE IMMUNIZE AND THAT CERTAINLY THE MAIN PURPOSE IS NOT TO SAVE MONEY IT'S TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S. HEALTH AND AND PREVENT DISABILITY AND INJURY. BUT WE ALSO NEED WE DO HAVE TO THIS IS A BUDGET COMMITTEE NOW THIS POLICY COMMITTEE AROUND HEALTH -- WE NEED TO ALSO BE SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE RESOURCES ARE TAKEN AWAY SO LABS SO WE'RE DOING A BUDGET. WE'RE GONNA BE BUDGET CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE VOTING FOR THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS -- WE HAD A BUDGET FIGURE -- THAT WE HAD SUCH A DISCUSSION ABOUT -- ACTUALLY -- EARLIER AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AROUND -- MONEY THAT DOWN THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REAL PULAK SOMEBODY IN ORDER TO HELP FUND AND YOU KNOW IT'S ADISEASE AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAY WAIT A MINUTE WE'RE GETTING OUR BUDGET CUT RIGHT AND SO WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. AND IN TERMS OF CAPACITY AND SO FORTH SO WE NEED TO QUANTIFY. THE NEEDS AND THE FLEX NEEDS A SOMEONE WE HAD WILD FIRES -- YES TELLS US IN CAL FIRE TELLS US OKAY WE SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY. THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT THE NEW ABNORMAL. AS WE DO OUR BUDGETING PROCESS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BUDGET. THE SPACE TO PAY FOR THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T JUST COME FROM OTHERWISE WE'RE ACTUALLY. HIDDEN TAXING EVERYTHING ELSE RIGHT WHEN WE'RE PULLING THE PERSONNEL OUT OF WELL WE GAVE MONEY FOR THIS BUT ACTUALLY THAT THAT YOU KNOW FOR LET'S SAY. DIABETES PREVENTION BUT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE PERSON GOT PULLED OUT THE ID'S PREVENTION TO DEAL THAT OUTBREAK AND THEY COULDN'T WORK ON THAT. SO WE MY BUDGET MONEY FOR DIABETES PREVENTION DIDN'T HAPPEN IF WE'RE NOT EXPLICITLY MEASURING THE COST AND SAYING OKAY AND WE NEED TO BUDGET FOR THAT. THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE LEAST ACCOUNT FOR IT AND MAYBE IT'S A FAX FILL IN THE NEXT BUDGET -- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW FROM FINANCES PERSPECTIVE SORRY ARE YOU LOOKING AT THESE THINGS I MEAN THESE THESE CASES I MEAN IT AT LEAST I'VE SEEN PREVIOUS REPORTS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TRYING TO CONTAIN OUTBREAKS IS NOT LIKE -- IT'S A FEW THOUSAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR COUNTIES IN THE STATE. TO TRY TO GET THE PENNY HOW BIG IT GETS TO TO CONTAIN THESE OUTBREAKS YOU WANT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED JUST. FOR THE HOUR THE CONTEXT EVEN TODAY DOT AND WE WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS LAY RIGHT. THAT IN MANY COUNTIES EVERYBODY STOPS EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING INCLUDING FOLLOWING UP ON SYPHILIS CASES BECAUSE NOW THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH A MEASLES CRISIS AND SO. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH BANDWIDTH PRESENTLY TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS NOW SELL. ARE WE BUDGET FOR EMILY BUT TO FURTHER EMERGENCIES TO WRITE SO. WE ARE ALMOST UPON A FINANCE. ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AS EVERY YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FUNDING -- PUT ASIDE FOR CONTINGENCIES ON EMERGENCIES SHOULD THE GOVERNOR DECLARE EMERGENCY THAN THAT MONEY COULD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THIS I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SOME OF THAT FUNDING WAS USED TO PROVIDE VACCINES. TO SAN DIEGO [inaudible] OKAY -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE GOVERNOR DECLARES AN EMERGENCY SO WE CAN TAP IN THE FUNDING FOR ALL THIS CONTACT TRACING AFTER NOW YET THIRTY EIGHT CASES OF MEASLES. SO HOW. OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY IDENTIFIED ON ON THIS ISLAND. OKAY NOW MANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- OKAY ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FOR FINANCE. ALL RIGHT SO -- AND I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE THE WORK OF THIS APARTMENT WE HAVE SEVERAL -- STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS -- SEE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT OKAY EIGHT STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS ON HERE SO WE'LL START WITH THE TALENT COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ALL RIGHT NOW. SO WE'RE GONNA DO THEM ONE AT TIMES I WONDER IF YOU'RE PART OF THIS PROPOSAL COME OUT THE OTHER WAY SUITE FOR YOUR TO BE CALLED UP NEXT FOR NEXT ONE SO AND AGAIN -- HOW MANY PEOPLE SPEAKING ON THIS? ONE WE'LL DO OKAY SO YEAH THE THREE MINUTES MAXELL ARI. GOOD AFTERNOON ALMOST EVENING OR EVENING AT MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA INTRODUCE DOCTOR ROBLEDO FROM PLASTER COUNTY WHO'S GONNA PRESENT ON OURS ARE ABDEL REQUEST. BUDGET REQUEST SKEWS ME THANK YOU. EIGHT A SPECIAL THANKS TO OUR PANEL MEMBERS. MY NAME'S ROB OLDHAM I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL I SERVICES HEALTH OFFICER AND PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR PLASTER COUNTY. IN THAT DUAL ROLE I AM A MEMBER BOTH OF CHI ACT WHICH IS THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO HO ACT THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA -- JACKSON HOLE ACT COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT CALIFORNIA SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HEALTH OFFICERS. AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M REPRESENTING BOTH JACK AND WHO ACT THIS EVENING -- REQUESTING YOUR CONSIDERATION APPROVAL OF AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE TO PREVENT CONTROL THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CASES REPORTED TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST DECADE. NOW THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE INTERNS SIXTY THOUSAND TITLE SEVENTEEN MANDATED REPORTABLE CASES EACH YEAR. THEY'RE ALSO MILLIONS MORE CASES OF NON REPORTABLE DISEASES LIKE INFLUENZA AND CHICKEN POX WHERE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE OFTEN INVOLVED IN SURVEILLANCE FOR IN RESPONSE TO THESE ILLNESSES AS WELL. WE FREQUENTLY SEE EVIDENCE OF THE SURGE OF NEW CASES IN THE NEWS -- THERE WAS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK -- PRIMARILY IN POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE DRAMATIC RISE IN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION RATES OVER THE LAST DECADE AND RELATED TO THIS THE WE'RE NOW SEEING FAR TOO MANY CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS -- THAT IS BABIES BEING BORN -- WITH OFTEN LIFE LONG AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES AND POTENTIALLY FATAL COMPLICATIONS OF SELFLESS PASSED DOWN FROM -- THEIR UNTREATED MOTHERS. THE GENERAL SERVICES 1100% PREVENTABLE AND SIMPLY SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN ANYWHERE ESPECIALLY NOT IN CALIFORNIA IN. TWENTY NINETEEN WE CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE OUTBREAKS -- IN THE ALREADY PROVIDE PERVASIVE VALLEY FEVER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE SEEING INCREASED NUMBERS OF CASES -- THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE ON GROWING -- MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED MANY JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING MY OWN. THEN THERE ARE THE EVERYDAY DISEASES THEY DON'T MAKE THE HEADLINES ON THINGS LIKE SHIGELLA SALMONELLA. OF CHLAMYDIA GONORRHEA -- WE'RE WE SEE -- LARGE INCREASES IN THOSE NUMBERS OF CASES TO THOSE ARE VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE THEY HAVE HUGE COST AS FAR AS THE HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT ALSO -- SOCIETAL COSTS -- PARTS TO FAMILY ECONOMIES IN OF OF COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES NOT HAVING TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM SENSITIVE OCCUPATIONS. SO IT'S CLEAR THAT -- THAT OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FACE THESE CHALLENGES AND THREATS -- AFFECTED CITIES OUTBREAKS BUT WE'RE NOT ADEQUATELY RESOURCE TO CARRY OUT OUR UNIQUE AND CRITICAL ROLE AN OUTBREAK INVESTIGATION AND DISEASE CONTROL RESPONSIBILITY FORCE THERE IS NO OTHER ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE. YOUR TIME IS UP OKAY. WRAP IT UP. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE FUNDING FROM A VARIETYOF SOURCES BUT THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING FOR COMES FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- WHICH CURRENTLY IS OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BELOW THE FISCAL YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT ALLOCATIONS AND IS INTO OUR VARIOUS DIVERSIONS TO ADDRESS OTHER PARTIES IN RECENT YEARS. SO I'LL JUST BE BRIEF TO WRAP IT UP SOLD OUT DEPARTMENTS ARE REQUESTING AN ONGOING CONTINUES APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CHERYL FINE THE REASON BEING IS YOU HEARD THERE'S A NUMBER OF OUTBREAKS AND THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO FACE AND SO LOCAL DEPARTMENTS ARE GRAPPLING TODAY AND REALLY. COULD USE THAT INVESTMENT INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM CITY PH OKAY HELLO. THE SONY PEDIGO AO THE ONLY COMMENT THAT WE WOULD MAKE AND IT'S THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NOTED OR AND NOW ANALYSIS OF THE REALIGNMENT PROPOSAL. WHICH IS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO INVEST IN PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS BUT ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW IS TRUE ABOUT THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGETS AT BOTH. THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL IS THAT THE FUNDING IS VERY CATEGORICAL AND LAX -- FLEXIBILITY -- FOR IT YOU KNOW PUT LOCAL AREAS TO RESPOND TO TO THEIR LOCALIZED NEEDS -- AND SO THAT'S I GUESS ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER VARIOUS PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE COMMENTS. SO A SERVER CRASH IS OKAY YOU'RE REQUESTING FEES -- FIFTY MILLION -- IS IT GETS PASSED IN THE BUDGET -- THAT THE HOUSE WAS TO DISPENSE THIS. HOW DO YOU SEE IT BEING DISPENSED YES I THINK THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE -- POBABLY UP TO CHECK AND SEE SELECTOR WITH ME TO DOWN THE ROAD THAT UP SO WOULD BE AN ALLOCATION THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONCERNS IN CONSULTATION WITH CHECK AND HOW ACTS SO -- IN THAT'S DONE ON A MYRIAD OF FUNDING SOURCES. WE LOOK AT PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN FACTORS IN THE COMMUNITIES AND THEN BUILD A FUNDING STRUCTURE BASED ON THAT. ALL RIGHT I'M I'M GOING TO PROPOSE A SUGGESTS A FRAMEWORK TO THINK ABOUT THIS -- THIS IS WE TALK ABOUT VARIOUS OUTBREAKS SOME MORE IMMEDIATE OTHERS PRESS MORE I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT STDS IS OVER THAT'S NOT JUST ABOUT COMMUNICABLE DISEASES TO I NEED I KNOW THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE HEADLINES NOW -- I THINK WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE HAVING TO DO WITH WILD FIRES RIGHT AND WE HAVE A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW -- YES BUYS FIRE TRUCKS FOR LOCAL HOLLERED FIRE DEPARTMENTS WHO JUST THEN CAN USE THEM FOR THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF WILD FIRES AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS -- THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MUTUAL AID W. AT THERE'S A MUTUAL AID STRUCTURE BUT THINK ABOUT FINDING -- A SYSTEM WHERE PRHAPS WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PART OF A PUBLIC HEALTH THE THE STATE FARM FILED GIVES GRANTS OUT TWO COUNTIES -- THAT TO HELP FUND POSITIONS THAT COULD BE PULLED. OUT FOR TO TAKE CARE OF ME IT BUT THEN WONDERED. WHEN THEY'RE NOT NEEDED FOR AN ON GOING PRESENT EMERGENCY THEN THAT PERSON YOU'VE KIND ENOUGH FIVE WHICH KIND OF PEOPLE YOU NEED? AND THEN THEY WOULD BUT THEY WOULD BE FINE HEALTH COUNTY EMPLOYEES WOULD BE PAID YOU KNOW WHO FUNDED THROUGH THESE GRANTS WHO THEN WOULD DO SOMETHING WHATEVER TASK NEEDS TO BE DONE AT THE COUNTY BUT THEN COULD BE PULLED. OUT THAT YOU MIGHT NOT PULL EVEN MORE PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE FOR A SO THINKING ABOUT A A SOME FORM OF THAT THESE I UNDERSTAND FROM OUR LAST HEARING IT'S REALLY STAFF AND STAFF CAPACITY THAT YOU NEED IS NOT LIKE YOU CAN -- THERE'S OUTBREAK I'M JUST GONNA HIRE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE SITTING AROUND WAITING AROUND FOR SOMETHING TO DO. TO HAVE THAT KIND OF READY CAPACITY WITH THE EXPERTISE BILL BAKED INTO THE SYSTEM. WHERE BASICALLY THERE ARE YOU KNOW CARRIED ANOTHER SCENES ONLY HAS TO BE PERSONNEL BUT I HEARD THAT WAS LIKE THE TOP THING YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME LEFT PASS AND SO FORTH THAT? BASICALLY SEE PH WORKING WITH -- THE YEAH COUNTIES AND HOW ACTIVE SO FOR THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE DO WE NEED IS BUILT FOR THAT COVERAGE IS A CAPACITY IN AND SAYING OKAY FINE WE'LL GIVE GRANTS OUT. WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES STATION AND NOW WORKING AT DIFFERENT COUNTIES BUT WHEN THERE'S AN OUTBREAK THEY GET PULLED. THE DEAL TO HELP YOU KNOW. HELP EACH OTHER OUT IN THE AREA I MEAN. COME THROW THAT OUT AS AN IDEA OF THE FREE BUT I JUST TRIED TO COME OF THE FRAMEWORK OTHER JUST THAT LIKE HERE'S SOME MONEY AND YOU GUYS GO TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE I MEAN ELLIE -- PREGGO WELL. THAT THAT'S A LITTLE TOO OPEN ENDED. SENATOR WE APPRECIATE THAT NIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO CREATE A MUTUAL AID FREE MARK WHEN ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE BORDER SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE REALLY. LEADING FOR THE OUTBREAK THAT THIS MONEY IS NOT OUTBREAK MONEY IT'S ACTUALLY MONEY TO TO BUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT'S ENTRANCE FOR PEOPLE RIGHT HERE SURE THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S WHAT THIS WAY MIGHT MY OBSERVATION IS IS THAT IF IT'S SIMPLY. A CHUNK OF MONEY THAT GOES UP THE NEXT RECESSION HAPPENS IT'S GONE. I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL BE GONE ANYWAY BUT I THINK IF THERE'S A FRAMEWORK TO THINK ABOUT IT. SEVENTEEN HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER DISCOUNT AS WELL OKAY THE DEAD ALL RIGHT. THE PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY I THINK THE WE'VE HAD INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND UNDERSTAND THE NEED IS THERE AND WE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE -- AND IT'S A MULTIPLE LATER ONE RIGHT COUNTY AND STATE AND EVEN A FEDERAL COMPONENT BUT THAT'S FOR CONGRESS TO FIGURE OUT SO. OKAY. ALRIGHT ANYTHING OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT TAKEOVER PROPOSALS FROM THE CALIFORNIA MUSICIAN COALITION -- REGARDING THE CALIFORNIAN STATION REGISTRY. WELCOME. A CATHERINE MARTIN MARTIN AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DECISION COALITION A STATEWIDE NONPROFIT FOCUSING ON IMMUNIZATION EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY. ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AS A COALITION IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATION INFORMATION SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS CARE. THE CALIFORNIA IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY WHICH HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE REGISTRY IS AN ONLINE DATABASE OF ASSIST HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HEALTH DEPARTMENTS SCHOOLS HEALTH PLANS AND PHARMACIES TO KEEP TRACK OF IMMUNIZATIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. IT ENABLES PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION MANAGE BACK SCENE INVENTORY AND PROVIDE DATA IN THE AGGREGATE ABOUT HOW OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DOING TO KEEP VACCINATION RATES STRONG. IT CONSOLIDATES RECORDS FROM MILLIONS OF PATIENTS FROM THOUSANDS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PHARMACIES AND AS OF FEBRUARY THERE OVER TWENTY NINE MILLION PATIENCE AND CARE WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TOTAL IMMUNIZATIONS. AND WE CAN DO BETTER. CALIFORNIA'S IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL DOLLARS AND IS SUBJECT TO THE UNCERTAIN AVAILABILITY OF EVER FEDERAL DOLLARS -- STATE FUNDING FOR THE REGISTRY WAS ELIMINATED DURING CALIFORNIA BUDGET REDUCTIONS IN TWENTY TEN AND ALL EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF A LOCAL ASSISTANCE FINDING THAT THE CITY PH IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM. HAD A STARKLY RECEIVED WAS ELIMINATED. AND THREE POINT TWO DOLLARS OF THAT FUNDING WAS FOR THE REGISTRY. BUT THE REGISTRY CONTINUED AND THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THE CALIFORNIA -- SEES FROM FEDERAL FUNDING BY THE CDC. FOUR MILLION OF THAT IS USED FOR THE REGISTRIES WITH WHICH LIMITS THE DOLLARS THAT ARE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS GET. SO BASED ON DATA FROM THE CITY PH THE REGISTRY IS CURRENTLY UNDER FUNDED BY AT LEAST TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. TO BE A STATE OF THE ART SYSTEM WE NEED TO HAVE A STABLE FUNDING SYSTEM FOR ENHANCEMENTS MAINTENANCE AND GROWTH. OUR BIGGEST FAN CHANNEL IS THAT RELIANCE ON LIMITED FEDERAL FUNDING. AS IT IS THE STATE RECEIVES LEVEL FUNDING FROM THE CDC YEAR AFTER YEAR WHICH IS ACTUALLY A CUT BECAUSE OUR STATE'S COSTS GO UP YOU'RE AFTER HERE AGAIN STAFF. AND IN THE WORK WE DO THEY DO. FULL FUNDING REQUIRE FULL THE FULL FUNDING REQUIRES AT LEAST SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO OUR CURRENT. OUR AND I'M BECAUSE WE PARTNER WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS THAT OUR THEIR CURRENT FUNDING EQUALS APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW FOUR MILLION FROM THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL GRANT FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS. ONE POINT THREE MILLION IN MEDICAID FUNDS THAT EXPIRE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THEY'RE BUILDING OTHER CUT COMING. AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT REGISTRY FLEW ACTIVITIES THAT STUFF THAT THOSE DOLLARS TO STATE TO SUPPORT INFLUENZA VACCINATION. THE FUNDING THAT IS NEEDED. ONE POINT THREE MILLION ANNUALLY AT pAND THEN I'M GOING TO REPLACE THAT MEDICAID FUNDING THAT EXPIRES IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ONE POINT ONE MILLION ANNUALLY FOR EXPANDED MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND STUFF. IMPORTANTLY WITH SUSTAINED AND CONSISTENT FUNDING THE STATE WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID MATCHING FUNDS AT 75% FOR THE REGISTRY ENHANCEMENTS AND 50% FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS AS LONG AS WE HAVE A STATE MATCH. WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS. CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW IS THE LARGEST NUMBER HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS TO KEEP TRACK OF YET PROPORTIONATELY WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVESTING AS MUCH AS WE NED. TO IN THIS DECISION MAKING TOOL THAT PROVIDES DATA. AND I'M INFORMATION PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND SAVE OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS A LOT OF RESOURCES TIME AND EFFORT.

NEARLY HALF OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT OR CONSISTENT CARE. THE CDC ESTIMATES THE ONLY ABOUT FROM PROPER CURRENTLY TAKING THAT.

THANKS VERY MUCH RIGHT SO WE WILL HOLD ALL THOSE ITEMS OPENED AND AGAIN. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN WHICH IS THE AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM A DEAF PROGRAM. YES -- MY COLLEAGUE A TERM BERASA IS JOINING ME -- TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL. JUST WANTED TO SAY BRIEFLY THAT THE A. THAT PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OFF AND IT'S SORT OF A CORNER PIECE OF OUR HIV PREVENTION EFFORTS AS YOU KNOW. THE MORE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN GET INTO A CHEVY TREATMENT THE LESS PEOPLE THAT WILL TRANSMIT THE DISEASE AND THE MORE. AND THE CLOSER WILL BE TO ACTUALLY ELIMINATING THE DISEASE -- MY COLLEAGUE WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO THROUGH OUR ON GOING ON WITH -- BUDGET PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE A GREAT RIGHT UP TO HERE SO I JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS. A GOOD EVENING A DRIVER OUT OF OFFICE. YEAH. BETTER. GET SOME DENTISTS ARE JUST TURN IT ON WHEN THEY DON'T HEAR YOU TURN IT ON THEN YOU'RE TURNING IT OFF SO YEAH THOSE ALL THE RED LIGHTS ON ITS GOOD OKAY. I'M SORRY JUST PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE EIGHT OUT NOVEMBER ESTIMATE -- SO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT INCLUDED EIGHT UP LOCAL SYSTEMS FINDING A FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WITH NO. FEDERAL STATE A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. THE REVISED CURRENT YEAR -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION WHICH IS A THREE A DECREASE OF TWENTY SIX POINT. TWO MILLION OR THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. AND THE REASON FOR THE DECREASE PRIMARILY AS A DECREASE IN MEDICATION EXPENDITURES. FOR MEDICATION ONLY CLIENTS WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY CLIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH COVERAGE AND FOR WHOM WE PAY THE ENTIRE COST MEDICATION -- FOR BUDGET YEAR FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY A PROPOSED EIGHT AT LOCAL SYSTEMS FINDING IS FOUR HUNDRED FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION OR THREE POINT 6% WHEN COMPARED TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET OUT AN INCREASE OF FORTY ONE POINT. NINE MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO THE REVISED COUNT YOUR BUDGET. AND INCREASE HERE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OVERALL MEDICATION EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE INCREASE AND INSURANCE PREMIUM EXPENDITURES. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I JUST WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO ONE ITEM BECAUSE I BELIEVE -- THERE WAS A REQUEST IN THE AGENDA -- RELATED TO THE EIGHT UP -- ENROLLMENT SYSTEM AND TELL BROAD PROJECT. SO FOR CURRENT YEAR THERE'S NO CHANGE IN BUDGET AUTHORITY -- FROM THE FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- BUT FOR BUDGET YEAR -- THERE IS -- AN ONGOING REQUESTS FOR THREE POINT THREE MILLION JUST FOR THAT -- FOR FOR BUDGET YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY. AND THAT PRIMARILY CONSIST OF TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION RELATED TO THE EIGHT UP IN ROMAN SYSTEM. AND ANOTHER. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOR THE PROJECT ITSELF. I THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM MALAYO. FINANCE RIGHT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. RIGHT WELL IT SAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S A WE HEARD FROM SOME PREVIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AND THEN -- PROPOSAL WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND AND FREE SHEET AT DEATH IS. VERY POOR PROGRAM TO HELP YOU SURE WE GET PEOPLE ON TREATMENT FOR HIV AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN TRY TO ELIMINATE HIV EVENTUALLY SELL THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WORK. ALL RIGHT SO -- NEXT ISSUE -- ISSUE LEVIN IS S. T. D. PREVENTION SOMETHING WE'VE. THREE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT BUT HAVEN'T ENDED YET HI YOU WILL PRESENT THE PROPOSAL ON AS YOU HEARD TODAY ON THE NEWS ON THE S. TO THE FRONT IS NOT GOOD -- THEIR RATES OF STV'S IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUED TO INCREASE. OUR PROVISIONAL DATA FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOWS ABOUT THE RATE OF INCREASE OF ALL MAJOR STV'S HE'S. STILL ON THE RISE. OUR LAST YEAR THROUGH A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL ON WE RECEIVED AN AUGMENTATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS -- UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A ONE TIME A ROMAN TATIAN -- OLDER THERE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN INCREASING THEIR CAPACITY AND I CAN. I WILL COME BACK IN A MINUTE TELL YOU MORE WHEN THEY'VE DONE WITHOUT. THE CHALLENGE FOR THEM HAS BEEN THAT BEING THAT IS A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO SECURE PERSONAL RESOURCES TO DO THAT MUCH NEEDED WORK THEY NEED TO DO. SO A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS -- ACTIVITIES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE STAFF RESOURCES SO OUR PROPOSAL IS -- IN THE HOPES THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT TWO MILLION DOLLAR -- AUGMENTATION PERMANENT SO THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE TWO YET AND DO ANOTHER REDUCTION IN THIS TO THE FUNDING. THANK YOU OF COMES FROM OHIO FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY. SO I KNOW THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO -- THAT I'D SAY. REACHED HER PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY MILLION REQUESTS -- SO I KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT ANSWER BUT THIS TWO MILLION REALLY ENOUGH. NO BUT I THINK. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE AN INCREASING PROBLEM ABOUT HI SONYA GETTING WORSE. SO ARE CLEARLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS IS JUST -- TO KEEP US WHERE WE ARE TODAY IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP -- IN IMPROVING THE SITUATION MORE THAN THAT -- I THINK THERE ARE. A BUDGET ESTIMATES THAT. AND PROJECTIONS THAT CAN BE MADE USING CDC. ARE GORY FILMS THAT WILL TELL YOU THAT TO ACTUALLY TURN THE CURB ON STDS WE NEED A MUCH LARGER INVESTMENT OKAY. OR MAYBE WE CAN GET SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN LOOKING AT THAT AND I MEAN I I THINK THE OTHER PART IS THE THINK ABOUT SO ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE RATE WE'RE TALKING HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED TO PUT IN. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE SPENDING ON THE MEDICAL SIDE WHEN PEOPLE YELL NEED DIRECT HEALTH SERVICES FROM THESE STDS. AND HOW MUCH WERE SO I KNOW WE WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT OUT PROP FIFTY SIX AND SOME OF THAT BUT ALSO ON THE ON TERMS OF THE ON THE MEDIC HAL AND GREAT BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE HAS AN STD. THEY'RE ALSO GONNA SIR FOR HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THAT THEN. IF THEY'RE A MEDIC HOW THAT'S GOING TO COST MEDICAL PROGRAM RIGHT NOW -- SO -- WE TALK ABOUT THOSE BABY THE ONLY TALK ABOUT THIRTY BABIES WHO ARE STILL BORN BUT AND THAT'S TERRIBLE BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF OTHER BABIES WERE BORN YOU NOW HAVE -- INJURIES STRAIGHT AND AND SOME OF THEM HAVE LONG TERM AND SO THAT HEALTH COSTS THAT. EDUCATION COSTS DEVELOPMENTAL COSTS. SO I HOPE WE CAN LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF NOT JUST LIKE OH WELL TWO MILLION AND DO WE WANT TO DO WATER AND HOW MUCH THAT COSTS BUT WHAT'S THE COST OF NOT DOING ANYTHING HOW MUCH ARE WE SPENDING NOW. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH AND NOT CHANGING THE CURVE. SO I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I PREVIOUS OFTEN POSE IT SAID THIS ONE'S PRIVATE OVER COMPLICATED FIGURE OUT BUT FOR A A BUT YEAH. YEAH I CERTAINLY CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION RIGHT NOW AND I I MEAN I GUESS ONE THING OUR OFFICE WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL OR NOT WELL WE WOULDN'T. NECESSARILY HAVE A AN ALTERNATIVE AMOUNT TO RECOMMEND RIGHT NOW THE TWO MILLION DOESN'T REALLY HAVE AN ANALYTIC PIECE IS ONLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT TWO MILLION ONE TIME WAS PROVIDED LAST YEAR. RIGHT SO THAT WAS ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WHEN WE SAW THIS PROPOSAL THAT. BASICALLY THE TWO MILLION REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE ONE TERRIBLE. DISEASE OVER ANOTHER -- SO IT YOU KNOW SO I I THAT'S WHY IS IT IN THE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BUT USING THE ANALYTICS WE SHOULD FIND OUT LIKE HOW MUCH YOU REALLY NEED TO BEND THE CURVE RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. OR WHAT HOW MUCH WE REALLY NEED. SO OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY IS BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE REALLY DOING A TWO MILLION AND WE REALLY WANTED TO CHANGE THE SITUATION AND HOW MUCH DO WE REALLY NEED. AND WE SHOULD BE KNOWING WHAT THAT NUMBER IS AND THEN WE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE IT IS IN THE PRIORITY RIGHT THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND BUDGETSBUT AT LEAST WE KNOW WHAT. HOW MUCH WE NEED TO TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT SO I'M HOPING -- I REALIZE THIS IS PRETTY LATE IN THE GAME BUT I THINK SOME WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT THAT WHETHER IT'S THIS BUDGET NEXT BUDGET OR SOMETHING -- BUT WE ONLY HAVE A SINGLE PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY MILLION FOR LET ME HAVE THIS SWITCH OVER I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO DO AN ON GOING SINCE AS A ONE TIME INITIALLY BUT LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THAT. AMOUNT THAT WE NEED. TO TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE CHANGE AND IF THERE'S A MECHANISM TO DO THAT YOU MENTIONED CDC HAS SOME SORT OF A THING. MAY WE CAN APPLY THAT AND COME UP WITH A NUMBER. SO WE CAN START CHANGING THESE NUMBERS. OKAY. OUR RIGHTS IS CITY WHO'S GONNA DO THAT. FINANCE. WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS TO EXTEND THE PRIORITY AS YOU MENTION OKAY SO I GUESS WHAT IT IS. TECHNICAL SO WHAT YOU SEE WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION AS TO EXACTLY HOW MUCH EVENTUALLY BUT IN TURN ORDER FORM THAT DISCUSSION I THINK IS THE ALLEY AS SUGGESTED AT LEAST CAN WE COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE AS TO THIS IS NOT LIKE EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE. THIS MUCH IS FOR SO I GOT A WHAT THE TARGET IS RIGHT ITSELF WE CAN HAVE SOME HELP IN TURNING TO TARGET THAT WOULD BE GREAT THAT OKAY [inaudible] I MEAN. YEAH WE HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT SORT OF DATA YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR OKAY WELL THE DATE I'M LOOKING FOR IS HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO WE NEED TO GET THE RESOURCES TO CHANGE THE CURVE ON THIS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT SO THERE'S SOME MODELS OUT THERE SOME MECHANISM SET OUT TO DO THAT YES AND I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT AND APARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE SURE THIS QUESTION GETS ANSWERED FOR YOU OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENT. SO GIVEN THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE FUNDING IS CONTINUOUS IT'S NOT IT'S NO LONGER ONE TIME WE DO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT A TWO MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO REALLY TACKLE THAT THE HUGE STD ISSUE THAT WE'RE HAVING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. IS NOT ENOUGH -- AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AROUND WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED TO MAKE. AN INVESTMENT TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD BE MUCH BROADER BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SKILL SETS THAT WILL ADDRESS STDS WILL ALSO ADDRESS OTHER DISEASES AS THEY COME ALONG SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT DISCUSSION. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO YOU HAD AN ON ITEM TWO HERE AND I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME YOU. CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT THE THE INVESTORS FROM LAST YEAR ARTISTS ARE BEING USED VERY WELL. WE ARE LOCATED THE FUNDING TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS USING A FORMULA THAT THEY HELPED US DEVELOP TO TARGET THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS -- WE WANTED TO HAVE MINIMUM A WARTS THAT WHERE AT LEAST GOOD -- FOR BASIC CONCEPT OF ACTIVITIES SO WEAK ARE HOT FUNDING FROM 270-002-60020 THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND WE FOUND THAT FIFTY LOCAL HELL JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE 86% OF THE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES -- AN 89% OF ALL SYPHILIS CASES AND SO WE WE GET THE NEW FUNDING WE WOULD DO A SIMILAR FORMULA TO MAKE THE DECISION ON ONGOING FUNDING. COUNTY SO USING THE FUNDS TO ENHANCE AND HAD A SEXUAL HEALTH AND EDUCATION ON FOREST TO THE SCREENING TESTING AND TREATMENT. FOR PUBLIC OUT OF REACH HI FOR ENHANCING POLITICAL SERVICE. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M SURE YOU MAKE VERY EFFECTIVE USE OF WHAT. MONEY YOU DO GET CELL AND APPRECIATE THAT AND THEY KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN BY DATA CELL. MISTER YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE MOST YOU CAN BUT NICE MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO DO THIS MUCH IS NOT JUST WHAT YOU WANT BUT THE CHANGE CURVE WHICH IS I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND I WANT AND I THINK PEOPLE CALIFORNIA.

UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THAT THEY HAVE NO ADULT CENTERS TO GO TO LIFE EXPECTANCY IN CALIFORNIA IS SHORTER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE.

WE CAN ACT -- TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WITHOUT HEMATOLOGIST THROUGH TELEMEDICINE. WHICH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT VERY SUCCESSFULLY FROM OUR HUB AND FROM OTHER HUBS IN THE STATE -- WE'RE ANXIOUS TO IMPLEMENT THIS IN AREAS THAT ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CHALLENGED AND PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF WORK FORCE HAVE NO FACILITIES THE SECOND PART OF THIS -- FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE USED FOR WORK FORCE EXPANSION THE THIRD IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY BASED. HEALTH CARE WORKER NAVIGATORS FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FRONTAL LOBE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION ISSUES FROM SILENT STROKES. OF THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES IN THE LAST PART IS REALLY TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE HOSPITALS MEDICAL SCHOOLS IN E. OURS THIS IS WHERE PATIENTS ARE GETTING THEIR CARE NOW. IT ISN'T THIS POOR THERE'S NO CONTINUITY OF CARE THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE A MORBIDITY SUCH AS ACUTE CHEST SYNDROME. AS BEING SOMETHING OTHER THAN BRONCHITIS AND THE PATIENTS GO HOME TO DIE.
