HOW WE'VE RESPONDED TO THE

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:58.148
CRISIS. WE DID REALIZE EARLY ON

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.816
THAT WE HAD TO HAVE A STRATEGY

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:01.051
THAT WAS GOING TO PROTECT

WORKSITE BY WORKSAFE BASIS- SO

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:15.131
FIRST. WE KNEW WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.500
LEVERAGE KNOWLEDGE AND

00:52:16.566 --> 00:52:19.503

OF A STANDARD. REGULATIONS THAT

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.043
WOULD COVER WORKERS SO THAT-

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.211
WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS WOULD

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:29.746
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.616
MINIMIZE RISK OF TRANSMISSION

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.518
TO COVER NINETEEN- SECOND WE

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:36.486
HAD TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:37.654
DISSEMINATE THAT KNOWLEDGE BY

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:39.356

CONSERVATORY SOURCES TO

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.078

VALUABLE TOOLS AND THEY'RE

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.838
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL DURING A

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:19.542

THEIR PARTICIPATION. THIS IS A

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.129
PIVOTAL CHANGE THAT WILL BUILD

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:42.231

SEVENTY POSITIONS. IN THE

SPRING OF NEXT YEAR- HOW HAS

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.315
THIS AFFECTED YOUR ABILITY AT

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:46.054
ENFORCEMENT. TO HAVE SUCH A

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:48.190
SUCH A HIGH VACANCY RATE. SO TO

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:53.162
HAVE A GREAT. WELL IT CERTAINLY

01:13:53.228 --> 01:13:57.232
HAS AN IMPACT- BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:13:57.299 --> 01:13:58.934
FEWER PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK WE

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:02.838
HAVE TO- PULL INSPECTORS INTO

01:14:02.905 --> 01:14:07.142
THE OFFICE TO CONDUCT-

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.977
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES IF WE

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:10.679
DON'T YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:12.414
TEMPORARY SHORTAGES OF A OF

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:16.018
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF DID A-

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.220
VACANCY RATES ARE EVER YOU KNOW

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.254
IF THE VACANCY RATE IS LOW AND

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.423
THEN WE HAVE. AN ABSENCE THEN

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.958
YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT CRITICAL

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:26.295
WORK STILL HAS TO BE DONE- SO

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:27.629
IT DOES DEFINITELY HAS AN

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.298
IMPACT IT HAS MORE IMPACT IN

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:30.566
SOME PLACES THAN OTHERS IT JUST

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.734
DEPENDS ON WHAT HE- STAFFING

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.937
LEVELS ARE IN- THOSE PARTICULAR

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:38.574
PARTS OF THE STATE- HELP YOU

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.942
AND THERE'S ALSO JUST THE ISSUE

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:43.145
OF WHAT THE- MIX OF EXPERTISE

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:45.647
IS WITHIN A PARTICULAR OFFICE

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:48.450
SO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.718
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THESE

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.653
CASES IS TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH. A

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.590
HEALTH EXPERTISE- AND SO

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:58.794
THAT'S- THAT'S BEEN A- A SKILL

01:14:58.861 --> 01:14:59.995

WE'VE BEEN IN AN EXTENSIVE

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.783
REBUILDING PROCESS FOR SOME

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.239
CERTAINLY IS- IS BEEN A STRAIN

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:53.041
ON THE SYSTEM AND IT'S BEEN AN

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:55.077
ONGOING LEARNING PROCESS. WE

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:58.947

SEEING RESULTS AND MAKING THOSE

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:05.120
HIRES- IT IS CERTAINLY

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.121
FRUSTRATING FOR ME AS HEAD OF

PROFESSIONALLY AND FEELING A

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.363
GREAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.897
TO THESE WORKERS WHO ARE

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:18.200
EXPOSED TO THESE HAZARDS- TO

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.068
SEE THAT GAP MYSELF BETWEEN

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.571
THE- BUDGET THAT WE HAVE

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.840

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.075
AND THE LIMITS ON THE STAFF

01:17:27.142 --> 01:17:27.676
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO SEND

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:30.012
OUT IN THE FIELD. I WOULD.

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.981
SUGGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGES OUR

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.816
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN TAILOR

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:37.452
THEIR TRAINING TO THE NEEDS I

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.254
WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.456
THAT BE USED. IF I MAY ON THE

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:43.525
FIRST PAGE OF THE BACKGROUND

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.360
BRIEF THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:46.528
YOU TALKED ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:47.829
INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.898
ENFORCEMENT AS A RESULT OF

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.933
COVERT NINETEEN- AND YOU'RE SET

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.168
FOR FEBRUARY ONE TO THE END OF

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:56.405
OCTOBER YOU HAD TWELVE THOUSAND

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:56.938
EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.774
COMPLAINTS. I PERHAPS I MISSED

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.875
IT IN THE DOCUMENTS BUT I

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.810
DIDN'T SEE WHAT THAT COMPARED

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.645
TO LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.147
THERE'S AN INCREASE BUT GIVE US

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:07.482
A BETTER IDEA WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:11.319
KIND OF INCREASES THAT. WHAT WE

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:14.756
NORMALLY HAVE- TEN TO TWELVE

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:15.357
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS IN A YEAR

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.392
SO- I BELIEVE BY THE END OF

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.261
OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST. WE HAD

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:20.929
EXCEEDED THIRTEEN THOUSAND

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.597
TOTAL COMPLAINTS SINCE.

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:26.201
FEBRUARY ONE- AND ABOUT EIGHT

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:26.802
THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE COVERED

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:29.171
NINETEEN RELATED- I THINK IT'S

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.472
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.973
COMPLAINTS ARE NOT THE ONLY

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.676
SOURCE OF OUR WORKLOAD WE ALSO.

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:36.344
HAVE A STATUTORY MANDATE TO

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.747
INVESTIGATE SERIOUS ILLNESSES

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.415
THAT ARE REPORTED. AND

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.951
FATALITIES THAT ARE REPORTED-

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:48.123
SO WE'VE HAD- AS OF OCTOBER

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.192
THIRTY FIRST TO SIX HUNDRED

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.960
FORTY FATALITIES REPORTED TWO

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.195
HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOSE WERE

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:55.130
COVERED NINETEEN RELATED AT

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.065
LEAST AS THEY WERE REPORTED

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:59.868
AND- FOUR THOUSAND OVER FOUR

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:00.469
THOUSAND SERIOUS INJURIES AND

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:01.837
ILLNESSES OF WHICH THOUSAND ARE

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.940
COVERED RELATED. AS WELL AS A

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:07.409
NUMBER OF REFERRALS AND OTHER-

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.677
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.805
IT'S REALLY JUST AN INTENSIFIED

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.306
MORE VISIBLE VERSION OF WHAT

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:27.342
WORKERS ALWAYS FACE IN TRYING

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.210
TO STAY SAFE ON THE JOB. WE'VE

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:30.478
SEEN A VARIETY OF EMPLOYER

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:32.780
RESPONSES FROM SOME THAT DO

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.315
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN AND

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:35.316
EVERYTHING THAT THEY KNOW OF TO

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.251
KEEP WORKERS SAFE BUT- FOR

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:38.586
EVERYONE OF THOSE THERE'S AN

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.922
EMPLOYER THAT. DOES LITTLE TO

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:42.557
NOTHING THAT EVEN GOES BEYOND

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.792
THAT TO SHAME WORKERS WHO TRY

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.761
TO STAY SAFE THREE PP OR MASKS

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.930
OR EVEN RETALIATE AGAINST THOSE

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:51.099
WHO REPORT HAZARDS OR GET SICK

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.401
ON THE JOB. WHICH LEADS US ALL

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:55.737
TO RELY ON CALLOW SHOW AND THE

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.238
LABOR MOVEMENT AND GROUPS LIKE

01:27:57.305 --> 01:28:00.341
WORKSAFE ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUALS

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:01.542
TO PROTECT WORKERS WHERE

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:04.245
EMPLOYERS WANT. AND TO FOCUS ON

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.114
CALIFORNIA FOR A SECOND THE

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:06.881
ISSUE OF STAFFING HAS BEEN

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:08.416
MENTIONED A LOT AND THAT'S

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:10.084
REALLY ONE THAT WE SEE AS THE

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.153
PRIORITY HERE THAT THE 20%

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.589
VACANCY RATE. HAS BEEN A PRETTY

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.391
STUBBORN ISSUE AT LEAST AS LONG

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.525
AS WE'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION

01:28:17.592 --> 01:28:19.160
TO WHAT THE 20% RATE HAS BEEN

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:20.862
THERE FOR AT LEAST A DECADE

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.730
DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.732
VARIOUS AGENCY HEADS AND THAT'S

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:25.333
DEFINITELY ENCOURAGING TO HEAR

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.502
THAT. THERE REMAINS A FOCUS AND

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:28.970
HOPEFULLY THIS TIME WE CAN MAKE

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:30.538
SOME SIGNIFICANT STEPS TOWARDS

01:28:30.605 --> 01:28:32.340
SOLVING IT BUT WE THINK IT IS

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.107
REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET A

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:34.342
LITTLE BIT INTO THE WEEDS OF

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:35.343
EXACTLY WHAT THAT LACK OF

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.578
STAFFING. NEEDS FOR WORKERS AND

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:38.880
THE PRIMARY PROBLEM THAT IT

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.615
CAUSES IS AS WAS MENTIONED A

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.384
FOCUS ON LETTER INVESTIGATIONS

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.018
AS OPPOSED TO ONSITE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:45.720
INSPECTIONS. AND JUST SOME

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.423
QUICK NUMBERS IN NINETEEN

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.958
NINETY TWO QALISYA CONDUCTED

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:51.526
TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

01:28:51.592 --> 01:28:52.260
AND EIGHTY INSPECTIONS IN

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:53.995
PERSON INSPECTIONS AND ONLY

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.396
SENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.432
EIGHT LETTERS. LAST YEAR BEFORE

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.867
CODE NINETEEN EVER- IT

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:03.237
CALIFORNIA THERE WERE SEVENTY

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:04.305
HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED. INTO AND

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:05.907
OVER SEVEN THOUSAND LETTERS

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:07.975
THAT WERE SENT. SO WHEN YOU

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.410
LOOK AT THE CHART THAT MAPS OUT

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:10.278
HOW MANY THAT DON'T EACH YEAR

01:29:10.344 --> 01:29:11.512
YOU CAN SEE IT KIND OF DOING

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.847
THIS. AND IT'S GOTTEN TO A

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:14.449
POINT EVEN BEFORE COVERT

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:15.583
NINETEEN HAPPENED. WHERE THEY

01:29:15.650 --> 01:29:16.551
WERE DOING ABOUT THE SAME%

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:17.785
NUMBER OF LETTERS AS ONSITE

01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:19.253
INSPECTIONS AND IS ONSITE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:19.987
INSPECTIONS ARE REALLY

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.022
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT THAT

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:22.724
MEANS IS THAT. AN EXPERT FROM

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:24.692
CALIFORNIA IS THERE IN PERSON

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.094
THEY ASKED TO SEE THE INJURY

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.562
ILLNESS PREVENTION PLAN THEY

01:29:27.628 --> 01:29:28.629
ASKED TO SEE THE FORM THREE

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.131
HUNDRED. THEY GET A REALLY GOOD

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.099
SENSE OF JUST HOW BAD THINGS

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:33.034
ARE AT THAT EMPLOYER AND YOU

01:29:33.101 --> 01:29:33.968
CAN SEE IF THERE ARE ANYTHING

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:34.969
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE GOING

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.971
WRONG. YOU JUST DON'T GET THAT

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.639
WITH THE LETTER INVESTIGATION

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.574
AND THOUGH THE LETTERS ARE ARE

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.675
DEFINITELY NOT USELESS THEY DO

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:41.909
DO SOMETHING WE NEED TO SEE

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:43.511
MORE ON SITE INSPECTIONS.

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:45.313
ESPECIALLY WITH COCA NINETEEN

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:45.913
TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.516
KEPT SAFE. AND IT ALSO REALLY

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:50.718
AFFECTS THE- THE EFFECTIVENESS

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:51.886
OF THINGS LIKE THE COVER

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.154
NINETEEN STANDARD THAT'S UP FOR

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:53.654
THE STANDARDS BOARD ON

01:29:53.721 --> 01:29:55.456
THURSDAY. THEN IT'S A GREAT

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:56.691
STANDARD IT'S A VERY WELL

01:29:56.758 --> 01:30:00.428
WRITTEN. WE VERY MUCH HOPE THE

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:00.995
STANDS FOR DISAPPROVAL. BUT

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:01.763
WHILE IT DOES GIVE EMPLOYERS

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:02.930
MORE CLEARLY AS FAR AS WHAT

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.232
THEY NEED TO DO TO KEEP WORKERS

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:05.933
SAFE. IT WILL GENERATE A LOT OF

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.034
COMPLAINTS I WOULD JUST KIND

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:08.369
OF. GO ON THE PILE OF

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:09.804
COMPLAINTS THE COLORS SHE JUST

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.105
DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.040
DEAL WITH. AND IN THAT SENSE.

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.642
IT REALLY IS GOING TO BE LESS

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.377
EFFECTIVE THAN IT COULD BE IF

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:17.178
WE DID HAVE THE STAFFING THAT

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.180
WAS NECESSARY. ALSO WANTED TO

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.149
MENTION THAT IN RECENT YEARS

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:22.984
EMPLOYER APPEALS OF CITATIONS.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.018
HAVE REALLY GOTTEN OUT OF

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.753
CONTROL. AND THAT HAS LED A LOT

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.755
OF INSPECTORS TO HAVE TO DO ALL

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:29.257
SORTS OF PAPERWORK. WHEN THEY

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.658
DO MORE SERIOUS CITATION

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.127
SERIOUS WILL FOR. ONCE IN ORDER

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.162
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITATION

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:35.163
CAN SURVIVE THE LEGAL

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:36.764
CHALLENGE. AND SO THAT'S

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:37.899
ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE MINDS OF

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:38.833
THE INSPECTOR WHEN THEY'RE

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:39.667
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:30:39.734 --> 01:30:41.169
RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT. HAS

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:43.037
BEEN REPORTED. THAT IF THEY DO

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.138
THIS AS AN IN PERSON

01:30:44.205 --> 01:30:45.473
INSPECTION. THEY'VE GOT TO

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.808
SPEND A LOT OF TIME FILLING OUT

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:48.075
PAPERWORK THAT'S TIME THAT THEY

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.043
COULD BE SPENDING DOING

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.244
SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE SENDING

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.679
LETTERS MAYBE INSPECTING OR

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:53.781
DANGER SUPPORT. SO IT'S NOTHING

01:30:53.848 --> 01:30:54.715
THAT PUTS HIM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.684
POSITION THAT LIMITS HOW WELL

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.386
THEY CAN KEEP WORKERS SAFE.

01:30:58.452 --> 01:30:59.253
THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE WHERE

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.655
MANY INSPECTORS ARE COMFORTABLE

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.690
DOING IN PERSON INSPECTIONS. SO

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:03.858
WE NEED TO WE NEED TO DO A LOT

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.092
TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:06.093
INSPECTORS HAVE THE TRAINING

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.829
AND THE PP THEY NEED TO KEEP

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.463
WORKERS SAFE. ALL OF WHICH KIND

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.631
OF ADDS UP TO A DEMORALIZING

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:11.933
EXPERIENCE FOR A LOT OF

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:14.735
INSPECTORS THAT. IT STANDS TO

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.137
REASON THAT DEMORALIZE WORKERS

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:17.672
ARE LESS LIKELY TO STAY AT THE

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.574
JOB AND SO THAT'S GOING TO

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.074
INTENSIFY THE STAFFING

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:22.276
STRUGGLES. BUT IT'S NOT ALL

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:23.811
ABOUT CAL OSHA ANOTHER BIG

01:31:23.878 --> 01:31:25.179
PROBLEM WE SEE WRITING OVER ALL

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.948
OF THIS IS THAT. FRANKLY NOT

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.649
ENOUGH WORKERS ARE IN UNIONS.

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.218
AND BEING IN A UNION CAN BE

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.353
PRETTY DECISIVE IN DETERMINING.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.621
WHETHER OR NOT. YOU WAS A

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:35.122
WORKER EVEN ABLE TO SURVIVE

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:37.091
THIS PANDEMIC. WORKERS IN

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.426
UNIONS AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO HEAR

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:40.528
FROM THE NEXT WITNESSES- HAVE

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:41.629
THE BENEFIT OF ALL SORTS OF

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.231
INTERVENTIONS FROM THINGS LIKE.

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.799
A UNION HELPING TO ENSURE

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:46.133
IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE WITH

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.902
EXISTING RAGS AND GUIDANCES.

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.871
PROVIDING PP WHEN EMPLOYERS

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.706
WANT TO EDUCATING WORKERS ON

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:53.474
THEIR RIGHTS. AND A LOT OF

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:54.675
OTHER STUFF THAT A UNION CAN

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.410
TAKE TO HELP PROTECT WORKERS.

01:31:56.477 --> 01:32:00.581
BUT WITHOUT A UNION. WHEN A

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:01.482
COMPLAINT IS FILED. K. OFF GOES.

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.317
THE TO GET A LIST OF WORKERS TO

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:04.418
TALK TO. OBVIOUSLY THE

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:06.020
EMPLOYER. IS NOT GOING TO PICK

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:07.989
THE VOCAL ACTIVIST TYPES THAT

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:08.723
ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:09.757
HAZARDS ARE GOING TO PICK THE

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.192
ONES THAT ARE. LESS LIKELY TO

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:12.660
DO THAT. AND SO THEY'RE GOING

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:13.628
TO GIVE A DIFFERENT

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.528
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT'S

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.030
HAPPENING TO THE INSPECTOR.

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:17.064
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SYSTEM IS

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:19.100
KIND OF DESIGNED TO. DOWNPLAY

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.601
THE SEVERITY OF THE HAZARD AND

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:21.636
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:22.670
GOING TO HELP THE PANDA

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:24.338
EXPRESS. HELP WORK HELP MORE

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:25.606
WORKERS GET THE VIRUS AND PUT

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.275
US ALL IN A WORSE POSITION.

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:28.910
ALSO WITHOUT A UNION WORKERS

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:29.810
ARE HARLEM WHOLE LOT MORE

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:30.578
LIKELY TO WIND UP

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:32.179
MISCLASSIFIED. AND OBVIOUSLY

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.915
MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS HAVE NO

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.549
CAL OSHA PROTECTIONS AT ALL.

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:38.419
BUT BY AND LARGE. THE PIPE BY

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:41.689
FAR THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT-

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:43.090
THAT'S AT THE TOP WORK HERE IS

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:44.625
THAT WORKERS. AREN'T IN UNIONS.

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:46.027
HAVE LITTLE IF ANY PROTECTIONS

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:48.362
AGAINST RETALIATION. THAT THERE

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:49.931
IS IT IS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL TO

01:32:49.997 --> 01:32:51.265
RETALIATE AGAINST WORKERS FOR

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:51.866
REPORTING HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:54.101
HAZARDS BUT- THE REALITY IS

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:55.503
THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:58.105
PROCESS THESE CASES. THAT MOST

01:32:58.172 --> 01:32:59.707
WORKERS. YOU KNOW IF THEY GET

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.175
FIRED FOR REPORTING SOMETHING

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.344
THEY STAY FIRED FOR YEARS IF

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.111
EVEN IF THEY DO STAY INVOLVED

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:05.446
WITH THE CLAIM. AND MOST OF THE

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:06.781
TIME THEY NEED TO GET A NEW JOB

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.382
AND THEY JUST MOVE ON. AND

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:09.583
THAT'S WHAT WE THINK IS THE

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.384
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DEAL

WORST IN PEOPLE. THIS IS AS

TRUE FOR PEOPLE AS IT IS FOR

THERE'S A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL.

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.152
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADING

LARGEST NUMBER OF FARMWORKERS

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:33.761
THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:36.163
AGRICULTURE IS FLOURISHING. IT

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:39.166
IS IT IS FLOURISHING BUT JUST

THE LAWS THAT GOVERN OUR STATE

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:18.832
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. LIKE OTHER

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:21.602
HISTORIC INJUSTICES THE SYSTEM

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:23.637
IS NOT BROKEN RATHER THE

01:37:23.704 --> 01:37:26.307
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM IS DESIGNED

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:27.775
TO KEEP FARMWORKERS FROM EVER

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.743
RECEIVING THE ECONOMIC

WHEN FARMWORKERS ORGANIZED THEY

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.526
CAN LIFT THEMSELVES UP AND

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:47.728
NEGOTIATE FOR THEMSELVES. THE

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:49.163
CURRENT VOTING AND ELECTION

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.398
PROCESS IS MEANT TO SUPPRESS

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.801
VOTES AND THE NIGHT OUTCOMES

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:55.769
ALL TO PERPETUATE THE ECONOMIC

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:58.839
OPPRESSION THAT HAS EXISTED

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.841
SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF SLAVERY.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:03.377

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:07.414
ADDITIONALLY FARMWORKERS ARE

HUMANS AS MUCH AS A PRIORITIZE

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.327

KING GRAPES IN FIRE ZONES. THAT

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.068
WILL REVIEW THE STATE LAWS THAT

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:29.703

WORKER DESIGNATION DOES NOT

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.020
MEAN THAT FARMWORKERS GET MORE

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:48.355

GOAL IS A SHORTAGE OF STAFF.

02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:46.904
CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOURTEEN

02:25:46.971 --> 02:25:48.272

DOLLARS AN HOUR AND MOST OF

02:25:58.616 --> 02:26:00.351
THESE POSITIONS ARE LESS THAN

02:26:00.418 --> 02:26:02.019
THREE HOURS A DAY SO THEY'RE

02:26:02.086 --> 02:26:04.155
VERY HARD TO FILL. UNTIL THESE

02:26:05.656 --> 02:26:07.825
OPERATING WITH YOUR STAFF THIS

02:26:07.892 --> 02:26:09.093
MEANS THAT EACH OF US HAS TO

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:10.728
PICK UP THE WORKLOAD AND FILL

02:26:10.795 --> 02:26:12.830
THAT GAP TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:14.198
MAILS ARE DELIVERED ON TIME.

02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:15.867
OTHER FOOD SERVICE POSITIONS

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.768
ARE PROTECTED FROM LAYOFFS AND

02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:19.637
THE STATE YOU'RE A BUDGET.

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:20.671
ACROSS THE STATE THERE ARE

02:26:20.738 --> 02:26:22.406
NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND LAYOFFS OF

OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT STAFF IN

02:26:24.442 --> 02:26:26.377
OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. AS WE

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:28.112
STRUGGLE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS

02:26:28.179 --> 02:26:30.348
WE NEED MORE STAFF NOT FEWER TO

02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:31.716
SAFELY PREPARE AND DELIVER

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:33.885
MEALS FOR STUDENTS. THE NEXT

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:34.886
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I WANT TO

02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:36.120
HIGHLIGHT IS THE NEED FOR

02:26:36.187 --> 02:26:39.190
WORKPLACE PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:40.124
THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. LOTS

02:26:40.191 --> 02:26:41.325
OF EMPLOYEES HAVE PUT THEIR

02:26:41.392 --> 02:26:43.227
HEALTH AND WELL BEING AT RISK

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:44.729
TO ENSURE CHILDREN. AND

02:26:44.795 --> 02:26:46.364
COMMUNITIES RECEIVE MUCH NEEDED

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:48.199
FAILED DURING THIS CRISIS. THE

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:49.867
EMPLOYEES ARE VERY WELL OF THE

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:52.003
POTENTIAL OF CATCHING COVERED

02:26:52.069 --> 02:26:53.671
NINETEEN WILL WORKING ONSITE.

02:26:53.738 --> 02:26:55.273
AND INTERACTING WITH COMMUNITY

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:56.974
MEMBERS AND YET. THEY DO SO

02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:58.743
WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IF

02:26:58.809 --> 02:27:00.077
IT WERE NOT FOR THESE MAILS

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:01.779
THESE KIDS COULD GO HUNGRY.

02:27:01.846 --> 02:27:02.680
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:04.749
DISTRICT HAS BEEN SELECTED AS

02:27:04.815 --> 02:27:06.584
ONE OF EIGHTEEN IN THE STATE.

02:27:06.651 --> 02:27:07.919
TO PARTICIPATE IN A PILOT

02:27:07.985 --> 02:27:09.053
PROGRAM FOR SURVEILLANCE

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:11.889
TESTING AND TRACING FOR STAFF.

02:27:11.956 --> 02:27:13.257
I HOPE THAT WE GET A GOOD

02:27:13.324 --> 02:27:14.425
PROTOCOL FOR THIS TESTING

02:27:14.492 --> 02:27:16.093
PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.628
THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AT OUR

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:19.030
WORKPLACE AND THAT ALL OF OUR

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.831
WORK SITES. AND I WANT TO MAKE

02:27:20.898 --> 02:27:22.500
SURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE GIVEN

02:27:22.567 --> 02:27:24.202
GOOD NOTICES AND TRAINING FOR

02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:26.938
THAT TESTING PROCESS. THIRD WE

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:27.805
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOOD

02:27:27.872 --> 02:27:29.473
SERVICE WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:30.741
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT

02:27:30.808 --> 02:27:33.211
THEMSELVES. TYPICALLY PEOPLE

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:34.845
THINK OF GLOVES AND MASKS WHEN

02:27:34.912 --> 02:27:35.813
THEY THINK OF PERSONAL

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.015
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. SOMETIMES

02:27:38.082 --> 02:27:39.250
THE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND

02:27:39.317 --> 02:27:41.786
CONDITIONS REQUIRE SPECIALIZED

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:44.155
PORTABLE EQUIPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE

02:27:44.222 --> 02:27:45.623
SINCE THERE'S NO DINING IN THE

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:47.458
CAFETERIA AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:49.293
TO LOAD THE MEALS ON TO CARTS

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:50.094
TO HELP TO GET THEM TO

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:51.429
CLASSROOMS WHERE THE STUDENTS

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.130
ARE NOW EATING. THEIR BREAKFAST

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:54.765
AND LUNCH. WE TEND TO FORGET

02:27:54.832 --> 02:27:56.400
ABOUT SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HAVING

02:27:56.467 --> 02:28:00.004
OF CARDS. SO THAT WE CAN

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:00.771
TRANSPORT THE FOOD. AND THERE

02:28:00.838 --> 02:28:03.808
ARE OTHER OF. IN SOME CASES WE

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:05.076
SHOULD HAVE A PORTABLE BARRIER

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:07.511
DEVICE LIKE PORTABLE PLEXIGLASS

02:28:07.578 --> 02:28:08.813
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE HANDING

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:10.281
OUT MEALS AT AN OFF CAMPUS

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:12.416

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:18.089
MEALS ENTIRELY OUTSIDE DEALING

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:19.223
WITH THE WEATHER IS AN ADDED

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.592
STRESS IN SERVING MEALS DURING

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:22.793

KEEP NO COLD OUTDOORS WITH

02:28:26.097 --> 02:28:28.199
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND WHEN

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:29.300
IT'S RAINING THERE ARE NONE OF

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:31.269
CANOPIES TO COVER EVERYTHING

02:28:31.335 --> 02:28:33.271
AND WHEN IT'S WINDY THE

02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:34.972
CANNABIS CABELO WAY. IN SOME

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:37.208
PLACES EMPLOYEES MUST SANITIZE

02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:38.276

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:45.650
SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT

02:28:45.716 --> 02:28:48.085
WE'RE FACING IN CONCLUSION THE

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:49.420
KEY POINTS I WANT TO LEAVE YOU
