BEGIN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE AT SUCH SUBCOMMITTEE BECAUSE WE'VE NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. ELICIT ANY OBJECTIONS. I WANT TO FIRST BE BEGIN BY GIVING ON THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE A DOVE A WARM WELCOME NOT ONLY TO THE LEGISLATURE UP TO THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU KNOW WE WILL BE A BIG STRONG OF VOICE. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. MISTER TOUGH YOU OKAY WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND AFTER THAT THE STATE THAT MR OBERNOLTE WILL BE ABSENT TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AB NINETEEN NINETY NINE WOULD EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO DEVELOP PUBLIC BROADBAND SERVICES WHILE PRESERVING NET NEUTRALITY TO ENSURE THE INTERNET REMAINS OPEN. AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS BROADBAND ACCESS IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE THE ECONOMIC THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE IN IMPORTANT PARTNER IN ENSURING THAT ITS BENEFITS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY AUTHORIZES MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICTS AND PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICTS TO OPERATE THEIR OWN BROADBAND NETWORKS. BUT OTHER FORMS OF INDEPENDENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITIES TO DO SO FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS CAN INITIALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICE. BUT HAVE TO SEE OVER THE AUTHORITY ONCE A PRIVATE ENTITY IS WILLING TO DEPLOY THE SERVICE. RESTRICTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM BUILDING OUT THEIR OWN HIGH SPEED NETWORKS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CLOSING CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE. ESPECIALLY IN ROAD AREAS WERE ONLY FORTY THREE PERCENT. THE POPULATION HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND IN THEIR HOUSE VOTES OR IN AREAS THAT HAVE ONLY ACCESS TO ONE PROVIDER. OR WHERE THERE IS A LACK OF ONGOING INVESTMENT. NOW THE IDEA THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN VOTING OUT LOCALLY OWNED BROADBAND NETWORKS HAS ALSO BEEN REKINDLED. BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS OUR RECENT ACTION THE FCC TO REPEAL NET NEUTRALITY RUSE. A FORMER NET NEUTRALITY RUSE ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OFFER EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL WEB CONTENT WITHOUT CHARGING CONSUMERS FOR HIGHER QUALITY DELIVERY OR GIVING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. OUGHT TO CERTAIN WEBSITES. NOW THE REPEAL WAS DONE DESPITE STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE PUBLIC. ACCORDING TO A RECENT POLL CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND. ON IN JUST TO DAYS PRIOR TO THE REPEAL MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE VOTERS OPPOSE THE F. C. C.'S PLAN TO REPEAL IT'S OUR NET NEUTRALITY RUSE. S. LOCALLY OWNED BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE BECOMING ALTERNATIVE FOR CONSUMERS IT SHOULD BE THE STATE'S POLICY TO UPHOLD THE TENETS OF AN OPEN INTERNET BY REQUIRING ADHERENCE TO THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY. THIS BILL AB NINETEEN NINETY NINE WOULD AFFIRM CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND ALSO COMPETITION SINCE THE REPEAL OF THAT NET NEUTRALITY RULES. WHILE AUTHORIZING THE EXPANSION OF PUBLIC BROADBAND SERVICES A WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES SO. MISTER CHRIS OUT MITCHELL WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY BROADBAND NETWORKS WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF RELIANCE. AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL FALCON FOR CON OF WHO IS THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION GERMAN. TYPICALLY WE GET FIVE MINUTES ON EACH SIDE. THERE'S NO OPPOSITION SO FEEL FREE DON'T FEEL PRESSURED TO USE THE FIVE MINUTES. GOT OUT LAST FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I'M CHRIS MITCHELL AT THE INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF RELIANCE WHERE FOR TWELVE YEARS WE'VE BEEN THE GO TO EXPERTS ON BROADBAND POLICIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY MUNICIPAL NETWORKS. AND MORE RECENTLY COOPERATIVE NETWORKS. WE TRACK MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE. OPERATING THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE. HAVE BECOME EXPERTS AND AND BOTH WHAT'S MADE THEM SUCCESSFUL. AND IN THE FEW CASES IN WHICH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WHY THERE WERE PROBLEMS AND WHAT TO DO TO CORRECT THOSE. I ALSO AM THE DEPUTY HER I'M I'M ACTUALLY THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR NEXT AND THREE CITIES AN ORGANIZATION THAT I HELPED TO FOUND. THAT INCLUDES LOS ANGELES SAN JOSE SANTA MONICA SEVERAL OTHER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES BUT HUNDRED EIGHTY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. BOTH OF US ARE IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF OF LOCAL RIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS AND STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE. OF THE ECOSYSTEM MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE INTERNET ACCESS THAT THEY NEED TO THRIVE. I WANTED TO INCLUDE JUST A BRIEF NOTE THAT THE. WAYS THAT SIDDIG THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AREN'T ANY PUBLIC UNIT GO ABOUT THIS VERY. THERE ARE METHODS THAT ARE EXTREMELY LOW RISK IN WHICH CITIES TAKE ON VERY LITTLE DEBT. AND ENGAGE AND MODELS THAT CAN PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GAINS AS WELL AS OTHER GAINES FOR. LOW INCOME HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL MODELS IN WHICH CITIES PROVIDE SERVICES DIRECTLY. AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE CABLE OR TELEPHONE ENTITIES. AND THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE OPEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENABLE OTHER ISPS TO USE IT TO COMPETE. SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM THEM FREELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WANT TO ENTER A FIRST SECOND.

CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SANTIAGO MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I MONIES ARE ASKED ABOUT GOING ON THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. I'LL KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF ON ANY TREES A TIME BUT. REALLY WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS IS TODAY HALF OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE ONE CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. AND YET FIFTY FIVE COMMUNITIES IN AMERICAN CHOI A AYE GIGABIT NETWORKS. PROVIDED BY THEIR OF THE GOVERNMENT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING THE WORLD'S FASTEST INTERNET COMPANY IN CHATTANOOGA TENNESSEE WHICH IS RUN BY THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I IT IS HAVE THE FASTENING HISTORY BEHIND HOW THE COMMUNITY OF CHATTANOOGA WAS WAS NEGLECTED BY THE INCUMBENTS AND HOW THE CITY DECIDED TAKE UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. OB BROADBAND ACCESS. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS THAT THAT I LEARNED FROM MY VISIT THERE WAS THE THE ONE OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM ON UP WITH EPB THE COMPANY OF THAT REPRESENTS THE CITY. THE FORMER EIGHTEEN T. EXECUTIVE NOTED THE REASON WHY THAT CITY WAS NEVER GOING TO SEEN YOU KNOW INVESTMENTS IN NEXT GENERATION OF BROADBAND WAS THERE WERE CONSIDERED BY EIGHTEEN T. A TIER THREE CITY. WHAT WHAT IS A TIER THREE CITY IT TIER THREE CITY IS A CITY THAT IS JUST NOT HIGH UP IN THE PRIORITY LIST FOR THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE? THIS THE CITY WILL OF A POPULATION OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH. A MEDIAN INCOME OF FORTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. DOZENS OF TOWNSHIPS AND CITIES IN CALIFORNIA QUALIFY PROBABLY IN THIS TIER THREE STATUS. AND WITH THE ABSENCE OF GOOGLE FIBER AND VERIZON WHICH OF BOTH. DICK NEW HAVE TERMINATE THEIR EXPANSION THE FIBER. YOU WERE LEFT WITH REGIONAL PLAYERS OUT LIKE SONIC NORTH CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGING IN AND PUBLIC A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. SO WITH THAT I WOULD FULL IF I FULLY SUPPORT HIS BILL WE BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO. YOU CAN'T TAKE THE INTERNET INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IF THEY SO DESIRE AND IN THIS BILL WOULD FURTHER ACOSTA WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S A COMMITTEE ON ANTHONY TAMA HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS MEASURE AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD.
