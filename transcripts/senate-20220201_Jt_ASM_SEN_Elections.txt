TODAY'S COMMITTEE TODAY THE COMMITTEES THIRD JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE CALIFORNIA RECALL PROCESS. IT'S ALSO THE FIRST SUCH HEARING SINCE I WAS NAMED CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE. BACK IN DECEMBER. HOWEVER I WAS PLEASED TO PARTICIPATE IN PRIOR HEARINGS FOR BEING AN OFFICIAL MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD UPON THE WORK. THAT THE COMMITTEES. I PLAN ON DOING. AND HAVE BEEN UPLIFTED IN THESE FIRST TWO HEARINGS I SPECIALLY WANT TO GIVE. IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT CHAIR GLAZER FOR ALL OF HIS EFFORTS. AND STEWARDING THIS JOINT PROCESS. YOUR LEADERSHIP IN PARTNERSHIP IS PART OF WHY WE'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR AND I THINK IT'S- GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR US TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THE RECALLS AN IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S DIRECT DEMOCRACY PROCESS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THAT PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ITS RULES AND FRAMEWORK MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AND WORK AS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED. LAST SEPTEMBER'S GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION. THE SECOND OF SENATE ELECTIONS IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS PROVIDE US WITH THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE HOW THAT PROCESS CAN BE IMPROVED. AND WHILE THE INTENDED RECALL THE GOVERNOR HAS RECEIVED THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF TENSION IN THE PRESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CLEAR FROM THE FIRST TWO INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS THAT THERE ARE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN. FROM CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE RECALL PROCESS. AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. WE CAN'T ALLOW THE RECALL PROCESS TO BECOME A TOOL USED TO ATTEMPT TO SUBVERT THE ELECTORAL WILL OF THE PEOPLE. AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAIN A MAIN MAINTAIN A MEANINGFUL ABILITY. FOR THE ELECTORS TO REMOVE A PERSON FROM OFFICE BEFORE THE END OF THEIR TERM. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR JOINT EFFORTS TO EVALUATE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF OUR CURRENT RECALL SYSTEM. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR THEM. I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM OUR EXPERT WITNESSES TODAY WILL GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING NOT ONLY OF THE CHALLENGES IN OUR CURRENT RECALL PROCESS. IT ALSO ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIANS FEEL ABOUT THAT PROCESS BASED ON THE SURVEY DATA FROM PP I SEE. SO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR THE WITNESSES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARINGS. AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES. THAT ARE TAKING TIME OUT OF THEIR SCHEDULES TO BE PRESENT HERE TODAY. I'M INCREDIBLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN THINGS OVER TO CHECK GLAZER FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AT YOUR BRYANT- AND THANK YOU FOR SEAMLESSLY PICKING UP THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE FROM HER BERMAN I'VE REALLY ENJOYED GETTING TO KNOW YOU AND TO- WORK WITH YOU. AND I THINK THIS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR HOUSES IS A IS A REALLY EXCELLENT EXAMPLE FOR HOW WE- CAN COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER TALK THROUGH A LOT OF THESE DIFFICULT ISSUES. IN A CONSTRUCTIVE POSITIVE WAY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUING THAT THAT PARTNERSHIP. AS YOU MENTIONED AT OUR PRIOR HEARINGS WE DID HEAR FROM. DISTINGUISHED ELECTED LEADERS AND EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. ON THE NEED FOR CHANGING THE RECALL PROCESS AND DIFFERENT WAYS FOR DOING THIS. SECRETARY OF STATE WEBER WAS OUR FIRST SPEAKER AT OUR FIRST HEARING IN OCTOBER. AND WE APPRECIATED HEARING HER. EXPERTISE AND HER WISDOM AS SHE TALKED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT YOU KNOW THE SECOND pGUBERNATORIAL CALL AND STATE HISTORY. AND SHE DID MENTION TO US THAT SHE WAS CONDUCTED OUR OWN REVIEW AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT WE HEAR FROM HER TODAY. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM HER WISDOM AND INSIGHT. I'M ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE CEO DR MARK BALL THE SORRY- HE'S CONDUCTED TWO POLLS- THAT INCLUDED QUESTIONS ON THIS RECALL PROCESS. AND I'M VERY. PLEASE THAT HE HAS CONTINUED THAT RESEARCH IS GOING TO SHARE WITH US TODAY FRESH INFORMATION- ON THE RECALL PROCESS FROM A THIRD POLL THAT HE HAS DONE. AS I HAVE SAID FROM THE ONSET IN THIS PROCESS THAT THE RECALL IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL OF THE ELECTORATE. TO HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE ONE THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORT. HOWEVER AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY WITNESSES- THERE'S SOME ISSUES THERE'S SOME CONCERNS THERE SOME DEMOCRATIC FLIES. ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS IS CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S A PART OF OUR PROCESS TODAY AND PREVIOUSLY TO TRY TO EXAMINE THAT DEEPLY AND POTENTIALLY PUT FORWARD ALTERNATIVES FOR THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO CONSIDER. SO WITH THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY TURN MATTER BACK TO CHIP REID. THANK YOU TRIGGERING FOR AS WAS MENTIONED SECRETARY WEBER. ATTENDED THE FIRST OF THESE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS AND I THINK IT'S ONLY FITTING. THAT WE BRING HER BACK FOR THE FINAL HEARING. I TO SHARE NEW PERSPECTIVES FROM HER OFFICE'S REVIEW. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH DOCTOR WEBER I THINK WE ALL ARE BUT- SHE SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM TWENTY TWELVE UNTIL HER APPOINTMENT AS SECRETARY OF STATE. IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE DURING THE TIME OF THE LEGISLATURE DR WEBER SERVED AS A CHAIR. FOR THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS. ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN RESISTING COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL AS A MEMBER OF THE EDUCATION ALEXION'S. REDISTRICTING HIGHER EDUCATION AND BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEES. ALSO ON THE FIRST DAY OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH I pRECOGNIZE. DR WEBER'S POSITION AS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO HOLD THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION SHE HOLDS TODAY- WE'RE HONORED. I SEE AN ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE SOME OPENING COMMENTS SO WILL MAKE SPACE FOR THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND JUST BRIEFLY- I'VE BEEN THROUGH. A WHOLE SERIES OF THESE HEARINGS THUS FAR. AND AS WE COMMENCE TODAY I'VE BEEN INCREASINGLY OF A MIND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO CHANGE. THE RECALL PROCESS CERTAINLY NO SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT'S BECOME MORE OF A HARDENED POSITION WITH ME THE MORE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SHARING. FURTHER THE SUMMONS WITNESSES WHO SPEAK AT LENGTH. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY WHO HAVE BEEN. OPPOSED TO CHANGING THE RECALL OR MAINTAINING IF YOU OF THE STATUS QUO WE'VE HAD MOST ALL WITNESSES WERE IN SOME MANNER OR ANOTHER CRITICAL. AND FURTHER AND THIS IS JUST AN INDICTMENT THE WHOLE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD USED TO BE RELEVANT HERE. BUT OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR A LOT OF REASONS- BEING BLAMED ON A CULL WOULD FOR ONE. PUBLIC COMMENT IS PRETTY WELL MEETINGS WELL JUST HAVE THE MODERATOR TAKE A POLL FIVE FOUR FOUR AGAINST. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU GET ONE MINUTE. OR IN OUR OWN HEARINGS LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS THEY GET TO SAY I'M JOE- FOR- JANE- AGAINST. LAYS DOWN THAT IS NOT PUBLIC INPUT AND I WISH THE PUBLIC. WITH THAT LETTER OUTRAGE BEACH SHEEN ABOUT HOW THERE ARE HAVING LESS OPPORTUNITY. SO WILL PROCEED AND WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER HEARING TODAY AND I THANK YOU OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR. THANK YOU IN WITH THAT WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR SECRETARY OF STATE DOCTOR WEB. THANK YOU VICE YOU'RE CERTAIN THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME TO. A COUPLE OF WORDS ABOUT THE PROCESS I SHARE SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS THAT ARE GOOD SENATOR- NIELSEN ALSO- HAS ECHOED- BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME BALLOTS SOME PEOPLE THAT DO OF IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. BECAUSE EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD AND I GREATLY RESPECT THE- A INTELLECT IN THE POLITICIAN YEAH- INPUT. BUT A LOT OF TIMES OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE SUBJECTED TO THE RECALL PROCESS AND DON'T REALLY WANT IT- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF A STATE WITH HEARING FROM PEOPLE THAT- THAT. HAVE ISSUES WITH CHANGING THE PROCESS BECAUSE CHANGING THE PROCESS- MEANS DENYING ACCESS TO OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS- WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO. ALLOW MORE ACCESS NOT LESS- ALSO YOU'D MENTIONED IT WAS WE HAD TO- RECALLS OF THE GOVERNOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS WELL WE ALSO ONLY HAD TO IN THE PAST HUNDRED TEN YEARS. SO TRYING TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR THAT HAS ACTUALLY GONE TO A BALLOT- SO- I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING SOME MORE COMMENTS- THIS MORNING- BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS WITH CHANGING THE PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE THOSE OPENING REMARKS AND I THINK IT'S- IT'S WONDERFUL THAT WE HAVE P. P. I SEE HERE TODAY TO SHOW PULLED FROM THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY. AND BEFORE WE GET TO THAT. MADAM SECRETARY DR WEBER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER NOT ONLY BY YOU- CHAIR BRYANT AND ALSO- SHARE GLAZER AND YOUR EFFORTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO- AS IN A FIVE PART IN A AND I'M- IN A ACROSS HOUSE MANNER SO THAT WE GET OUR SENATE AND OUR ASSEMBLY TOGETHER. ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE- I READ WITH YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR OF YOUR- SESSIONS AND EXPRESSED TO YOU AT THAT TIME SOME CONCERNS I HAD BUT I SAID AT THE SAME TIME. BUT I DIDN'T WANT THIS JUST TO BE THE SHIRLEY WEBER SHOW THAT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST WHEN SHE THINKS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND SO I WANTED TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS AROUND THE STATE TO FIND OUT OF THEIR THINKING AND- WE DID A BI PARTISAN KIND OF. OF ACTIVITY AND SO WHAT I DID INSTEAD OF ME BASICALLY SERVING BECAUSE I KNEW THAT YEAH I WOULD BE A GREAT SURVEYS I ASKED TO INDIVIDUALS- WHO ARE FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES. I ASKED THE FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN- AND THE FORMER CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUDGE. JUSTICE RIGHT GEORGE. TO HOLD MY PART OF CONGRESS. WITH SCHOOL. TO JIM JONES. THREE COPPER. AND WHAT THEY MIGHT. CRITICAL AND TIMELY REFORM IF THEY NEED ALL- THE LEGISLATURE HAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HELP REFORM THE FALL PROCESS. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S LONG HELD EMBRACE OF THE RECALL IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS AND CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. AND THAT IT METS THE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE VOTERS WHERE WE ARE AND THAT WE ALSO. DON'T FORGET THE MANY WAYS WE CAN AVOID THE UNNECESSARY TIME CONSTRAINTS AND COSTS THAT MAKE CONDUCTING A RECALL DAY IN ENDEAVOR FULL OF UNNECESSARY RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS- I WANT TO SAY THE BEGINNING THAT NO ONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROCESS OR EAT- HAD ANY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ELIMINATE THE RECALL PROCESS- CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE IN- IN RECALL THEY BELIEVE IN THE- PUBLIC HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO WHICH IS TO. ENGAGE IN AND REMOVING A PERSON FROM OFFICE BUT THEY ALSO BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT- THE UNIQUE THING OF CALIFORNIANS THAT WE HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO DO IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC BUT LIKE ANYTHING- THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE WAS LONG AS THIS HAS AND IS THE TIME TO CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE STATE THE RESOURCES. ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS MAKERS WANT TO AT LEAST LOOK AT IT AND TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE THINK ARE SOME ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO- MAKE THE RECALL PROCESS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS WE'D LIKE FOR IT TO BE ONE WAY THE OTHER BUT A TRULY FAIR TO EVERYONE THAT'S INVOLVED. DO YOU THINK LAW COMMITTEE ALONG WITH NAY THING GUARD DALE HELPED ME AS WE S. STATE AND SERVE JUSTICE ALONG WITH MY STAFF- OF BROWN AND CHIEF JUSTICE RON GEORGE- THEY UTILIZE OUR STAFF AND INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY- ADMINISTRATIVE CONTACTS THEM TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. THE CONTAINER THAT HOLDS SUCH A COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WAS THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS HOW JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION THE N. DOUBLE ACP ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE MALL DEATH MALAYO SEIU CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION CALIFORNIA CALLS. HOW MANY CALLS AND WE ALSO CAN DID THEY ALSO COULD WITH THE- GUY. GRAY DAVIS. AND THE FORMER GOVERNOR. ARE ALSO- THEY MET WITH ALSO TO WITH A BILL WHERE WEAPONS KIND. RICE IN THE WHO AND- OF EXT. JOE- MATTHEWS ALL A GLOBAL FOR THE MY THERE TO MY- AND PRINT A PETER. WHO THE DEAN OF PUBLIC POLICY SCHOOL UP ANYA. SO WE TRIED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO GET A CROSS SECTION OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO REPRESENT. VARIOUS PARTIES VARIOUS IDEOLOGIES TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR TAKE ON THE RECALL AND RESPOND TO SOME ISSUES- REFORM ACT AS IS A PART OF ANY OF THE RECALL PROCESS SHOULD CONSIDER. THE IMPACT ON AN OVERALL VOTER ON OVERALL VOTER PARTICIPATION. SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE SOME IDEAS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF THE REFORM THAT'S THERE BUT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WHATEVER WE DO WILL HAVE A- POSITIVE EFFECT. ON IT AND EVERY ISSUE YOU HAS ALL THE ISSUES THAT BECAUSE IT'S A NOT TO BE AS EFFECTIVE. AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THAT OUT- BUT IT'S CLEAR UP FROM ACROSS THE BOARD ITSELF HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE RECALL. THAT THEY FELT COULD BE IMPROVED COULD BE TWEAKED AND WANT TO LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC- ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS AS YOU PROBABLY PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE DID NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD SPLIT THE ISSUE. BETWEEN THE NO VOTE FOR A RECALL AND THE END OF THE SITTING OF THE ISSUE AND A YES VOTE WILL CONTENDERS. THAT IN ITSELF PROBABLY CREATED MORE CONFUSION WITH INDIVIDUALS- THE MINIMUM CONFUSION AROUND THE PRIMARY QUESTION OF SUBJECT OF THE RECALL AND THE QUALIFICATIONS AND THE MOTORS OF REPLACEMENT. I HAD A TENDENCY TO OVERSHADOW WHAT THE RECALL WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT. AND IT IS ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL ELECTION TAKING PLACE IF WE DO WORK TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE. BUT IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY GOOD PRETTY CLEAR THAT MOST FOLKS THOUGHT THAT THE- UP AND- IT WAS DIFFICULT TO VOTE- FOR ONE THING AND THEN TO VOTE FOR THE OTHER THING WOULD SUCH A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RUNNING. AND THEN FEELING AT THE SAME TIME. BACK TO BECAUSE IT WASN'T RUNOFF BECAUSE IT WASN'T ANY WAY TO REALLY HONE. THE REPLY- WE WERE RUNNING THE RACE OF HAVE REPLAY. AND VERY LITTLE SUPPORT FROM THE PUBLIC- THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PASSED. FIRST TO LESS VOTE AND BECOME GOVERNOR- TO REPLACE PERSON WHO GOT MORE VOTES. IN FAVOR OF THEM- THAN THAN THE OTHERS AND THAT'S A REAL FATHER WAS A REAL POSSIBILITY. WITH REGARDS TO- THE WAY THIS RECALL IS STILL STRUCTURE EVERY STATE DOESN'T STRUCTURE TO RECALL THAT WAY. AND YET WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND I THINK IT HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT UPON. HOW FOLKS DECIDE TO VOTE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT. THIS REALLY DOESN'T LIVE UP TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN TERMS OF THE MAJORITY VOTE AND AS A RESULT WE END UP WITH. A HUGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS RUNNING- WE ALSO WANT TO AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT- AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD THAT THE MECHANIC GOVERNOR. SHOULD ACTUALLY. BE THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE AT LEAST AT THAT POINT. PEOPLE WHO ARE VOTING WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR. NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE RECALL BUT WHO THEIR BOOK WHO WOULD TAKE THAT PLACE AND SO THEREFORE. THEY HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S COMING- THE PAST ELECTION MADE IT SUCH A DIFFICULT THING THAT PEOPLE HAD. DIFFERENT FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD- THEY VOTING. AT THIS TIME WHEN THE BUILDING SOME. SO THAT IF THEY THEY WANTED TO RECALL THE PERSON THEY MAY NOT LIKE THE CHOI. THAT WOULD BE A OR FEARFUL THAT THE CHOICE THAT WERE BEING MADE- I'LL- ON WHERE THE MOST MONEY AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WILL LEAVE US WITH A CANDIDATE OR A SPACE SPLIT- PODOBE INDIVIDUALS AS WE SELL- ELECTION GIVEN THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE WITH THE PROBLEM. IF THE THAT WAS A CONCERN OF GREAT CONCERN TO STEER. THE GROUP BUT ACTUALLY WE- THE LIEUTENANT OBVIOUSLY CRAZY WITH YOU AND I GUESS WHAT THE- IN THE MEETINGS I BIT INTO. SHE KNOW SHE DID THINK IT WAS A GOOD SYSTEM TO BASICALLY HAPPY. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THERE COULD BE ALL. OF- WELL. ISSUES OF THEM PUSHING THE RECALL. SO THEY COULD BECOME GO OVERNIGHT. I PUT THE REALITY IS ELECT LIEUTENANT. WHAT THE END IS. THAT THEY PERSON IS PREPARE IT WILL BE. TO STEP IN INCOME THERE IS ANY. OF BACK. IN CASE THERE IS A- IN CASE THE- REMOVED THE PERSON FROM. OR IN CASE OF UP HORRIBLE. OR SOMETHING OF NATURE I SAW **** IS THE- GOVERNOR LIKE TO BUY SPREAD. UNITED ITS PER. TO TAKE ALL- THERE'S A FEAR. DIFFERENT PARTIES AND I'LL KINDS OF THINGS ARE CAN HAPPEN MANY OF THOSE THINGS. THAT ALSO STOP THAT MAYBE IF. IN IT SO. THAT THAT IS WAS GOING TO AT THAT. THAT MODEL THAT WE GET. ALSO CHANGE WE ELECT TO. GOVERNORS THAT WE LOOK LIKE TO NEW TEN GOVERNORS. TO THE WAY WE SELECTED A VICE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES. THAT THE GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR RUN ON THE SAME TICKET. SO THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO THAT PERSON. WHO WOULD TAKE AND THEN BASICALLY UPLOADING FOURTEEN. UP SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS IN FACT MOST FOLKS FILLED MORE THAN ANYTHING THAT- THAT. IT LEFT US VULNERABLE TO END UP WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE GOVERNOR. WHO- WHO DID NOT ENJOY THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT- WAIT THEY ALSO COULD. THAT MOST FOLKS ASK QUESTIONS WHY ARE WE DOING RECALL ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE RECALL. THAT'S ALL THERE IS DISCUSSION THAT YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE ABOUT- THE WAY WE IDENTIFY. WHAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE OR INAPPROPRIATE. SOME ARE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD USE THE SAME KIND OF. LANGUAGE THAT WE USE FOR IMPEACHMENT- THAT THIS IS A FORM OF IMPEACHMENT BY THE PUBLIC VERSUS IT AND FORM OF IMPEACHMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE TE SAME AND THEREFORE WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AND BASICALLY REQUIRE THAT AS A- AS A STANDARD FOR THE FILING OF. A PAPERS TO DO A RECALL THAT THEY HAD THE BIG THIS IS THE PEOPLE SAME STANDARD OF IMPEACHMENT. AND IS BASED ON PERFORMANCE AND BEHAVIOR- THAT IS THE AND THEY FEEL THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF INCAPABLE UNSATISFACTORY IS TOO LATE. AND AND IS SUBJECT TO ABUSE. THAT DOUBT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE GREATER STANDARD SIMILAR LIKE WE HAVE WITH AN IMPEACHMENT. PROCESS YEAH CONCERN ABOUT OB. THE CITY SIGNATURE. AND ENACTED BE BALLOT WITH OUR- ABOUT PEOPLE. TO HAVE AN- TO IF WE WAIT IT. TOO HIGH. WE SAY LIKE SOME STATES YET A BIT DEPRESSED. OF THE ELECTRIC WITH ONE FIVE. BUT THAT MAY IT VERY DIFFICULT IN THIS DAY. TO ACT FOR THE- TO. ENGAGE IN. BOB AND SO AND SO OF THE SAID. WAS THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T END UP AS WE DO NOW. WE PEOPLE. KIND OF ANALYZE WHETHER NAY BUSINESS AT A GOOD IDEA TO DO- A RE. THE OF THE TERM OUT THAT TOOK PLACE THE GLOBAL. ELECTION THAT WE SHOULD ABOUT IT THE STANDARD THIS WASN'T THE HIGHEST ISSUE THAT PEOPLE REYES. BUT THINK ABOUT BASICALLY UTILIZING. OF THE NUMBERS THAT THAT PRETTY STANDARD THAT IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS NOT NECESSARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ACTUALLY SHOWED UP TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION. BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS AT THE END OF THE ABILITY TO- PARTICIPATE IN THE RECALL ELECTION. AND SO THEREFORE THEY THEY SHOULD BE ADDED INTO THE VERY WELL THAT'S THE YEAR. THERE WAS CONCERN OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME AND YOU KNOW MANY STATES DON'T GIVE YOU A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAYS WHICH IS ALMOST A HALF WHICH IS A HALF OF A YEAR. TO BASICALLY- DO YOU RECALL PETITIONS AND WE SAW AN EXTENDED PERIOD THIS TIME MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE- COLD EVERYBODY BLAMES ON CALL THAT AND THE COURTS AGREED. AND SO AS A RESULT WE END UP WITH ALMOST AN ALMOST A YEAR. WELL OF TIME TO COLLECT SIGNATURES AND THEY WERE. IS THAT IF THERE ARE FLAWS IN THIS PERSON'S- PERSONALITY. FLAWS IN HIS BEHAVIOR OR HIS SERVICE- THOSE ISSUES SHOULD BE RESPONDED TO ALL RIGHT AWAY AND NOT. TAKE ANOTHER ALMOST A YEAR OF WORK YOU CAN IN A BAG WAY MORE AND MORE ISSUES IN APPLE'S ISSUES TO. THE RECALL SO THERE'S A CONCERN THAT ARE PART TIME FRAMES ENTIRELY TOO LONG- EVERYONE. SUPPOSED US. CREASING FEES AND- M. SIGNATURE PRESSURE FOUR. CANDIDATE AND THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT THE PUBLIC CITY STAFF ACCESS. TO THE RECALL. SHOULD BE REASONABLE BUT IT SHOULD. HAVE ACCESS TO THE RICO. BOB THIS YEAR- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MAIN THINGS THAT FOLKS HAD A- IS A CONDITION. OF THAT CONCERN OF WHETHER THERE'S- THAT WE HAVE DONE IN. INTO ABOUT. PROCESS WE REGARD TO PROCEDURES THE SHOULD BE. CALL WE CAN'T. WHO ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE OURS ARE EXTREME IMPORTANT ISSUES- AND THAT'S A SAY AN SHOULD BE. EFFORTS TO DRIVE REALLY THE KIND OF RECALL THAT WE WILL TO HAVE AND THE- THIS YEAR- WE- THINK CAUTION. THIS THAT. FACTOR ACOSTA ALWAYS A- BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE AT A POINT WHERE. FEEL THAT- DONE RIGHT. AND SO- WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ARGUING THAT THE COST BACK TO BACK TO THE YEAR. BUT WE ARE ARGUING SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES- THAT MAYBE HAVE DIFFICULTY. I UNDERSTAND IT NOW BUT I'M SURE TO OUR CALLS BACK TO BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING- DURING THIS LAST RECALL ELECTION. WITH THE NUMBERS WILL BE OUT TO DATE OUR STAFF IT'S BEEN WORKING SO LATE LAST NIGHT THIS MORNING TO VERIFY ALL OF. THE MATERIALS THAT CAME IN. THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF- MADE POSSIBLE EIGHT AN ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED I THINK IN SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE RECALL PROCESS- AND- AND AS A RESULT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. THE ONLY WE SPENT A HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON THE RECALL SO WE- WE WERE- WE MADE GOOD ON YOUR INVESTMENTS WE DID NOT. THE WHOLE TUNE IN SO THE SPEECH WAS NOT SPENT. UP THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION- THAT WAS COUNTY COST AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION. THAT WAS SECRETARY OF STATE COST- THERE'S STILL SOME COUNTIES THAT HAVE- NEEDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE ABOUT SIXTEEN OF THEM BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT- BASICALLY PULL OFF THE ELECTION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AND YOU'LL GET THOSE IN A REPORT AS IT COMES FORWARD- THAT TURNED OUT OF COURSE AND ELECTION WAS TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS. ABOUT IT. WHICH WAS A COST OF ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT. FIFTEEN DOLLARS LITTLE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER PERSON. THAT WE PAY FOR THE ELECTION- THERE WERE THERE WERE TWENTY TWO ELIGIBLE REGISTERED VOTERS- AND WHICH IS GAY AT ALL HOLD IT BUT WE DID OUTREACH TO ALL OF THEM WHICH MEANS THE COST WAS. EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS. AND NINETY TWO DOLLARS PER VOTER AND THAT WAS THE RESULT- RECALLS ARE EXPENSIVE. AND ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT WHEN WE DO WE CALL THAT WE GET IT WE DID IT THIS TIME THAT WE- OPERATE THAT THE STATE PAYS FOR IT- IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY BUT IT IS IF THERE'S A RECALL ELECTION STATEWIDE. IT SHOULD TELL THE STATE SHOULD PAY THE COSTS OF THAT WAS. STRONGLY FELT BY THE PERSONS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND THEY WERE GRATEFUL FOR OBVIOUSLY FOR- FOR YOU. BEING ABLE TO DO THAT- JUST IN TERMS THE- ASK. OF IT. THE TO. OF ASPECT OF IT IS THAT. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. A TO RUN INTO LAW OR ELECTION SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- AFTER WE WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF COLLECTING SIGNATURES VERIFYING SIGNATURES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT INDICATING THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY OTHER WAS ENOUGH SIGNATURES OBVIOUSLY PUT THE RECALL. WE HAD DID LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAVE BETWEEN EIGHTY TO SIXTY DAYS- TO BASICALLY CALL THE ELECTIONS. ELECTION OFFICIALS UP AND DOWN THE STATE'S SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A BIT MUCH MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO ADMINISTER AN ELECTION IN A STATE THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA. UNCERTAINTY AFTER THE ELECTION DATE PREVENTS PRINTING BALLOTS AND VOTER GUIDES AND OTHER REQUIRED MATERIALS UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE AN ELECTION GETTING- UNFORTUNATELY WE ONLY HAVE FORTY SOME ODD FORTY THREE FORTY FOUR- PERSONS ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR I THINK THE LAST TIME WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SOMETHING. TO TRY TO PRODUCE A DOCUMENT WITH THE INFORMATION ON ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IS DIFFICULT AND RUNS THE RISK OF LAW ERIS- RUNS THE RISK OF THE PAPER SHORTAGE AS WE I HAVE OF. WHAT ABLE TO MEET THAT BUT WEREN'T SURE INITIALLY WE WOULD DO THAT BE ABLE TO MEET THE PAPER SHORTAGE THERE'S A PAPER THAT THERE'S A SPECIFIC PAPER THAT THE BALLOTS ARE PRINTED ON. AND TRYING TO MEET ALL OF THAT AND NAVIGATE THAT AS WELL AS WE HAVE OVERSEAS BORDERS THAT WE MAILED BALLOTS TO ANOTHER FEMALE EVERYONE A BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA IT MAKES IT- A VERY MUCH MORE DIFFICULT PROCESS ONE IS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. IT ALSO DOESN'T GIVE MUCH TIME- THE CURRENT PROCESS DOESN'T GIVE MUCH CAR IMPROPER PEOPLE TO VETS- TO GET TO KNOW THE CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR THE WAY THIS IS SO STRUCTURED IT'S ALL DONE AT THE SAME TIME- AND AS A RESULT WE DON'T GET A CHANCE THOUGH TO BASICALLY. TALK ABOUT THE QUALIFICATIONS THE ACCESS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ACCESS AND FIGURE OUT WHO'S RUNNING WHAT THE REAL ISSUES ARE IT'S PRINTED IN A BOOKLET BUT IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AMONG CANDIDATES FOR THE LARGEST STATE IN THE UNION SO. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- WOULD CONCERN AS A SAID ABOUT THE COST AND A THE ASPECT IT IS TRULY ONCE BACKED OUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS. WHAT THE PROCESS IS. GOING TO- WELL THE ISSUES WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE PERSONS ARE. THAT ARE RUNNING A WHAT THEY CALL THE- ARE ALL-THOSE KINDS OF THE- BECOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT. TO THE PUBLIC WE TALK ABOUT- REMOVING A GUN. OR REMOVE ANYWAY FROM OFFICE. AND YET W DON'T THAT TIME TO TIME TO. IT TO ACCESS IT WE DIDN'T MUCH AS WE COULD IN THE SIGNATURES. OFFICE WE USED UP WE UTILIZE A NUMBER OF- OF- RESOURCES IN TERMS OF PUBLIC MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS MAILING THINGS OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNEW THAT THERE WAS AN ELECTION UNDERSTOOD THE PROCESS THEY VOTED TWICE. SO FORTH AND SO ON BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT WITH PEOPLE WITH A PROCESS THAT YOU DON'T DO VERY OFTEN. YOU TRY TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT AS TO HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS. SO IN IN THE YEAH LET ME JUST SAY THAT- THERE'S SOME CONSENSUS THAT THE STRUCTURE IN THE LONG TERM REFORM DESERVES PERIODIC REVIEW AND WIDE RANGING. AND PROLONGED SCRUTINY- THE RECOMMENDATION OFTEN IS THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOME KIND OF COMMITTEES- EVEN MY OFFICE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE OR THE LEGISLATURE. THAT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE RECALL PROCESS. OF TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ALL THAT WE STILL. ARE ABLE TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS WE SAY WE CAN DO WITH THE RECALL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE DONE THE NEXT LEVEL TO PERFORM IF THERE'S ANYTHING. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT TO TAKE TIME TO FULLY ASSESS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS BUT- WHETHER IT'S BROKEN AND IF SO. WHETHER IT NEEDS FIXING AND- AND IT WAS NOT THE FIXING IS BETTER THAN. OF THE PARTS THAT WE HAVE A WHERE THE NOT THIS IS JUST A BLOCK SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH- SO MUCH THAT CONSIDERED IN HIS COMMITTEE THAT WE DO SOMETHING LIKE SELECT COMMITTEES AND INDEPENDENT CITIZENS COMMITTEES AND REFUSED. TO PRINT OUT TO KEEP US UP TO WHERE WE ARE WITH REGARDS TO RECALL. BUT ALSO WITH OTHER ISSUES. MANY OF THEM HAD TO ISSUES WITH THE WHOLE INITIATIVE PROCESS. THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW- SO MANY ISSUES ABOUT- ST. IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE RECALL PROCESS AS WELL AS THE PETITION PROCESS. AND SIGNATURE GATHERING. LIVES TO EXPECTATION EMBARKED UPON THIS WHOLE PETITION ISSUE. FROM THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE FELT THE PUBLIC NEEDED A VOICE. AND THE RECALL PROCESS TO THE PUBLIC NEED A VOICE. BUT THE IS COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT IT IS NOW ALMOST EVERYONE AGREES. THAT IT BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE PERSON. TO ENGAGE IN ESTABLISHING OR DOING A RECALL. IT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND MONEY. AND OFTENTIMES OUTSIDE INFLUENCES DETERMINES THE NATURE RECALL AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF PETITIONS THAT WE SEE. IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION. SO NOT ALWAYS- UNTIL THERE IS GREAT CONCERN THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH AND MAYBE WE CAN'T. TO BASICALLY A PROBE INTO THE ACT I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT DO YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE- I WOULD WANT TO CAUTION ALL OF US THAT DOWN. THAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY DID NOT. RUSH TO JUDGMENT TO NOT RUN QUICKLY TO. THE SOLUTIONS WHAT TO SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THEM TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION. AND REALLY BEGAN TO WORK TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG A PROCESS ONE THAT THE PUBLIC SEES IS BEING FAIR. TO IT NOT ONLY TO THE PERSON BEING RECALLED BUT TO THE PUBLIC ITSELF AND IT REALLY IS THE VOICE OF THE PUBLIC. AND MANY FELT THAT THIS LAST PROCESS WAS NOT- THAT DIED IT WAS AS I SAID IT DID NOT GIVE THEM THE ASSURANCE. BACKED UP IF THEY RECALL THE GOVERNOR THAT THEY WOULD BE ACTUALLY SELECTING A REPLACEMENT. ALL AND THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF THAT AS WELL AS THE- THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO GOOD THERE WAS NO RATIONALE THEY COULDN'T COME UP WITH THE COST FOR THE RECALL. THEY FELT THAT THEY WAS OUT. OF SO MANY THINGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. DIFFERENTLY THAT'S THE- WE. WELCOME YOUR INPUT WE'RE LOOKING SOME POINT THIS HAVE A- TO WORK CONTINUE WORK WITH YOU. ON VERY ISSUE CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO BREAK. BY YOU SO MUCH. SECRETARY WEBER THANK YOU FOR THAT INCREDIBLY THOROUGH. THOROUGH RUN DOWN I THINK I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF. BOTH COMMITTEES AND SAY THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE SPENT IN LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE FROM. ALL THE VARIOUS ANGLES THAT YOU JUST PRESENTED. TO US. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR. ANY QUESTIONS. GLAZER THANK YOU CHAIR BRYANT. SECRETARY WEBER AS THAT JEFF BRIAN INDICATED THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR REVIEW. CERTAINLY OUR APPRECIATION TO CHIEF JUSTICE. RON GEORGE THE GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND THE MANY PEOPLE IN WHICH SHE CONSULTED WITH. TO TO BRING THE- THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM YOUR OFFICE IN FROM YOU. SO- MUCH APPRECIATED. SO IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE TODAY. AND YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY PUT FORWARD TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA A CHANGE OR NOT. WHAT WHAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT GO ISSUE. YOU KNOW- I PERSONALLY IS AS I LOOK AT IT IN AND TRY TO BRING A SENSE OF FAIRNESS WITH THAT I SURELY WOULD NOT- I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THE RECALL QUESTION BOB WOULD BE A SINGLE QUESTION ON THE BALLOT SHOULD WE SHOULD WE NOT RECALL THE GOVERNOR. I THINK IT BECOMES CONVOLUTED WHEN YOU ADD NAMES TO THE LIST AND YOU HAVE ALL OF THE FOLKS RUNNING AT THE SAME TIME- PEOPLE ARE NOT EVALUATING IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG THAT WE NEED TO DO RECALL ABOUT AND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S ALWAYS BECOMES IS THIS PERSON BETTER THAN THE OTHER FORTY THREE AND THAT BECAME THAT THE CONVERSATION MUCH MORE THAN THE DISCUSSION OF RECALL- SO I WOULD DEFINITELY WOULD SEPARATE THAT. I WOULD LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE SPANISH THE RECALL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS AND HOW DO WE EVALUATE INCLUDE EVALUATE WHAT THE APP IS BEEN PROFICIENT EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION TO PUT IT ON THE BALLOT FOR RECALL THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE CONSISTENTLY I WAS ASKED AS I WENT AROUND AND NOT DOING THE RECALL PROCESS IS WHY ARE WE DOING THIS WHAT ARE THE PERSON WHO DOES WRONG I KNOW AND IT BECOMES VERY YOU KNOW DIFFICULT TO ANSWER BECAUSE OF THE FACT. THAT THE- THE ALLEGATIONS ALL THE ISSUES OF WRONGDOING WOULD NOT VERY CLEAR AND THEN PEOPLE WORK GREATLY CONCERNED- AT THE END OF THE PROCESS AND I SAID THE ONLY THING I CAN ENSURE TO MOST FOLKS IF THE GOVERNOR'S RECALLED IS THAT WE WOULD END UP WITH SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE DIDN'T EVEN WHAT'S WHAT'S NEXT GET FIFTY PERCENT. ONE AND WE DON'T HAVE A RECALL AND WE DON'T HAVE RUNOFF PROCESS ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE I KNOW TO TEN A GOVERNOR IS NOT EXCITED ABOUT TO STEPPING INTO THAT ROLE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. AS A FEEL SAFE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS PREPARED TO SET EXPERIENCE WHO CAN STEP INTO THAT ROLE AND WHEN YOU PICKED A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR- YOU SHOULD BE PICKING SOMEONE YOU BELIEVE WILL STEP INTO THAT ROLE OF THE SAME IS TRUE I THINK WITH THE- AND SOME ARGUED AND I WOULD PROBABLY SAY IF THERE'S APPEARS. TO BE A CONFLICT THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND GOVERNOR ON. THE SAME TO. SO THAT YOU KNOW WERE YOU'RE BY. UP FRONT AND THERE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT JUST. COULDN'T UP A- IS. ON THE BILL. Y. KNOWING TO THEY KNOW. WHAT THEY CHOSEN. AS A SECOND. SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE- IS. SAID THERE. IF WE CAN LOOK AT THE TIME FRAME. I WOULD DO THAT. I MAY WILL ALSO. THE NUMBER OF TIMES PEOPLE CAN DO RECALLS IT WAS SAYING THIS AND THAT IT. TOO MUCH IT AT THAT AT OUR LEVEL. BUT AT OTHER LEVELS WORK THE FIRST TIME YOU DON'T GET THE SIGNATURES COME BACK AGAIN THE SECOND TIME YOU COME BACK AGAIN A THIRD TIME. AND IT BECOMES JUST THE OF THE WORLD RECALLS IN IN TERMS OF OUR REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AND UP- IF THEY RECALLS A PERSON HAS A- LEGITIMATE REASON TO DO THE RECALL SHOULD BE DONE IT SHOULD BE PUT OUT THERE. AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT- LOOK UP YOU KNOW WE CAN DIDN'T ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS. IT IS ALSO GOOD SUGGESTED THAT WE DO A THAT IF WE GO DOWN THE PATH WHERE- WITH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. ACTUALLY BECOMES THE GOVERNMENT THERE'S A RECALL. THAT THAT PERSON THAT THE ELECTION TO CHOOSE A GOVERNOR HAPPENS AT THE NEXT STATEWIDE ELECTION. WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE ALL ON AND OFF YEAR IT COULD BE- WHENEVER WE'RE DOING A STATE ELECTION THAT WOULD PREVENT US BY HAVING SUCH AN EXTREME COSTS. FOR ANOTHER STATEWIDE ELECTION TO CHOOSE THE GOVERNOR. OF THE STATE IT WOULD BE BLENDED IN WITH THE NEXT ELECTION SO. IF SAY FOR INSTANCE IF FOR SOME REASON THE NEW SOME HAD BEEN RECALL THIS TIME- COLLECTORS WOULD BECOME GOVERNOR. AND SHE AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE ON ELECTION IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR. OUR PRIMARY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THEN THE GENERAL ELECTION AND WOULD ALLOW IT SHE WANTED TO RUN. FOR THAT SEAT BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD NOT INCUR AN ADDITIONAL COST. TO TRY TO FEEL THE GOVERNOR'S SAT FOR A FEW MONTHS. AND AND UP BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY VOTED THERE ARE REPLACEMENT. IS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WE DID THAT WHEN WE HAD THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND IT WOULD HOLD TRUE THAT THIS WOULD BE A REPLACEMENT. UNTIL WE HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION BUT WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO HOLD OFF UNTIL THE NORMAL CYCLE THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTION. IT WOULD BE THE NEXT STATEWIDE ELECTION. THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK ARE A REASONABLE- AND GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN BE PROUD OF OUR- OUR RECALL PROCESS. THAT BE FAIR TO THOSE WHO WERE. MORE INTERESTED IN. THE GOVERNOR. WILL BE FOR TO THOSE WHO ARE. THE OF THE GUY. WHO'S BY TO BE REACHED. AND TO BEGIN. A GOOD. TO THE- IN TERMS OF KNOWING- THAT THEY- MADE A DECISION TO RECALL BASED ON THE STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE. AND THAT THEY RECALL THE PERSON. KNOWING THAT THEY'VE ALREADY CHOSEN REPLACEMENT WHEN THEY DID THE FIRST ELECTION. AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. CHECK THAT THE SELECT THE GOVERNOR. I MEAN THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK THAT ARE. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE OUR PROCESS IS FIGURE. OUT FOR ALL THAT TO THAT ARE ALL INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS. THANK YOU US SECRETARY LEVER FOR YOUR THOROUGHNESS AND YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS THE PROCESS GOES FORWARD. THANK CHAIR RIGHT. YES A MEMBER BEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR BRIAN- SECRETARY WEBER I'M- I'M I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE THOROUGHNESS ALSO. OF YOUR- RECOMMENDATIONS. AND PARTICULARLY. IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR GLAZERS WHAT WOULD YOU SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON- I'D LIKE TO ASK. WITH REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF. COMBINING THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WITH THE GOVERNOR. BOTH IN THE ORIGINAL ELECTION LIKE WE DO AT WITH THE UNITED STATES. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF. A LIMON AIDING A LONG LIST OF OTHER CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT. AND THEREFORE ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU IDENTIFIED AS A CONCERN WHICH IS TRYING TO PREPARE. A BALLOT PAMPHLETS XCERRA FOR FORTY OR FIFTY OR SIXTY- CANDIDATES AND GETTING ALL OF THAT- AND I WOULD ALLOW. IT WOULD IT WOULD ELIMINATE SORT OF THE WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT THEM SO. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU HOW SIGNIFICANT DO YOU TAKE IT IS THAT WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE. OF THE CHALLENGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOUR- THE CLERK RECORDERS IN. VARIOUS CANDIDATES. IN VARIOUS COUNTIES TO. NARROW THE RECALL DE DOWN TO- MORE DO. VALID VOTES FOR THE FOR THE L. THE ELECTORATE- AND ALSO FOR THE ADMIN. OF THE LAW. IT WOULD BE- CLEARLY- A MUCH EASIER JOB TO DO BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND WHEN WE HAVE FOLKS WHO- FILING TO BECOME TO RUN FOR THE REPLACEMENT. WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM TIME FRAME FOR THEM TO- PUT THEIR PAPERS TOGETHER GET THEIR MATERIAL TOGETHER GET THE MONEY TOGETHER SO THAT YOU YOU'VE GOT A WEEK TO. CONSULT AND SOME EVEN A LOT LONGER TIME SO YES IT WOULD BE EASIER BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE LEVEL BUT AT THE AT THE AT THE- COUNTY LEVEL BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION SHOULD YOU RECALL THIS GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT LIKE- YOU KNOW I DO YU LIKE THESE PEOPLE THESE OTHER FORTY PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PRINT ALL THIS MATERIAL FOR AND ALL THE DOCUMENTS FOR AND ALL THE CERTIFICATIONS AND EXAMINE ALL THE THINGS THEY PUT TOGETHER- THE QUESTION IS IT. POSSIBLE FOR YOU SHOULD YOU RECALL THE GOVERNOR AND- AND IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION AND BUT IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO I THINK MORE CONVERSATION AND DEBATE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO. EXAMINE WHAT THE QUESTION IS AND WHETHER NOT IT'S A BALLOT ENOUGH QUESTION FOR YOU TO VOTE TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR RATHER THAN HAVING ALL OF THIS STUFF PUT TOGETHER AND A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THROWN AT THE PUBLIC VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THEY HAVE TO MAKE THESE CHOICES AND THEN MAKE LIMITED THINKING STRATEGICALLY DO LEVEL FOR THIS VERSUS THAT THEN THERE WAS A WHOLE MOVEMENT TO SAYS DON'T GO FOR ANY REPLACEMENT WHICH WHICH OBVIOUSLY COULD HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPLETE DISASTER. AND SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T I THOUGHT YOU KNOW VOTING FOR ONE OF THE VOTING AGAINST THE OTHER INSULT SO IT REALLY WOULD SIMPLIFY THE MATTER IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER AUG TWO AUG FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE A DECISION. AND THEN IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER AND GOING FORWARD THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED A GOVERNOR HAS BEEN RECALLED A LOT OF THE OTHER BUT WE WOULD HAVE A CLEANER AND A FASTER PROCESS- AND ONE THAT WOULD PROBABLY GIVE PEOPLE MORE INFORMATION. THAN THE CURRENT PROCESS WE HAVE. THANK YOU SERVE TO WEBER ONE ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT IF THAT IS. AN IMPROVEMENT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- AT THE STATE LEVEL- WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE TO CONSIDER HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL A WE ALSO CAN HAVE. THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH IS YOU CAN HAVE A RECALL M. AND YOU CAN HAVE MULTI. OTHER CAN. TO WHAT WHAT WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE STE A LOW RE. AS A OTHER- YEAH REMOVAL FROM OFFICE OR SOMEBODY DYING IN OFFICE IN OTHER WORDS USED TO LOCAL PROCEDURE THAT EXIST RIGHT THEN IF THE CITY COUNCIL REPLACES YOU IF YOU DIE IN OFFICE THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD REPLACE YOU IF YOU'RE RECALL FROM OFFICE RTHER THAN HAVING YES- SAME CHALLENGE OF HAVING ALL THESE OTHER CANDIDATES RUNNING IN THE RECALL BEFORE WE KNOW WHETHER WE'VE RECALLED. AND THEN AS YOU STATED- HAVING THE NEXT AVAILABLE ELECTION BE WHEN THEY ACTUALLY THE ELECTORATE VOTES TO REPLACE THAT CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE OR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER BECAUSE THAT'S RIGHT I THINK I SEE THE GREATEST ABUSE OF THE RECALL HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WE'RE- PEOPLE THE RECALL EFFORT IS BEING DONE. PURELY FOR NARROW POLITICAL REASONS AND NOT FOR ANY OF GREGIS- ETHICAL VIOLATION ON THE HEART IT ON ON ON THE PART OF THE CANDIDATES SO- DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THAT DID THE FOLLOWING THE SAME KIND OF CONCEPT- THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT SHOULD- YOU KNOW THE PROCESS OF REMOVING A PERSON FROM OFFICE IS A VERY SERIOUS THING AND- NOT ONLY FOR THE PERSON BUT FOR THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE STRUCTURE THAT'S IN HERE AND THOSE WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS IT WILL PART OF IT SO IT SHOULD BE DONE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY AND NOT DONE- OFTEN- I KNOW THAT- I'VE SEEN GROUPS CASES OF ISSUE WHERE THERE'S BEEN I DON'T KNOW THE- RECALL OF THE PERSON WENT OVER. WHICH TO ME IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT THE FIRST TIME LT'S MOVE ON AND SO I THINK IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE TO BEAT THIS SOME GUARD WILL TO PEOPLE PUT OUT THE DRAFT AT LEAST BEEN IN OFFICE FOR YEARS BEFORE YOU CAN BE READY CALL YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IN ORDER TO EARN A RECALL AND SO- SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS I THINK THAT ARE IMPORTANT. SOME CITIES HAVE A VARIOUS PROCESSES IN SAN DIEGO WE HAVE LOST TWO DIFFERENT MAJORS ONE JUST RESIGNED AND THE OTHER ONE- NOT GUESS WHO'S BEEN THIRTY NOW WE PASS WE WERE. UNIQUE WEEK WE HAD THE WE'VE HAD GOVERNOR UP. WILL LEAVE THIS. OF VARIOUS. READ AND THE CHAIR OF THIS CAN. BECAME THE BIG ACTING MAY. I KNOW FULL WELL TONY. WAS THE ACTING MAYOR FOR. AND IN- TALK GLORIA GLORIA WAS AS NUMBER BUT HE WAS. ME AFTER- TWELVE CHILDREN LIVE SO THERE A PRESS THAT'S- THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT'S THAT THE CITY. DO THEMSELVES WITH THEIR C. COUNCIL AND I THINK THEY'D CAN STRENGTHEN IT PROBABLY BY MAKING SURE. THAT IF THERE'S A RECALL PROCESS THAT THAT'S A PART OF BUT JOIN PEOPLE. DIED OR MAYOR RESIGNS OKAY THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE AND THAT THEY USE IN TERMS OF. THE CITY COUNCIL OFFICERS AND- ACTING MAYOR UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION AND SO FORTH AND SO ON BUT- I THINK TRYING TO. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE A STANDARDIZED AND YOU GO FROM ONE BOOK TO THE NEXT SOME CITIES HAVE 20% FOR RECALL. SIGNATURES OTHERS HAVE LESS- AND- AND I THINK IT'S A NEW ONE IF CITIES AS MUCH OF A TANAMI AND YOU PASSABLY CAYENNE- TO MEET THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY CITY IS VERY DIFFERENT. AND YOU CAN'T DO A LOT OF L. A. B. PROCESS WITHOUT SUTTER COUNTY OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. THE SIZES ARE SO DIFFERENT AND- SO DIFFERENT. BUT I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK AT THE PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE THERE ABOUT IT- IN TERMS OF. HAVING A DINNER FIVE WHAT THE SECESSION YES AND WHO COMES IN. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- BUT THEY MAKE IT SHOOTS OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT DOCTOR. ACTUALLY HAVING SOME SOMETIMES FRAME AND SOME LIMIT TO THE NUMBER RECALLS THAT YOU CAN PUT. THIS ON ONE PERSON. ALL THAT STUFF CAN BE VERY DISRUPTIVE TO IF WE'RE CONSTANTLY FALLING PAPERS FOR A RECALL ON SOMEONE WHO JUST GOT AN OFFICE. AND I'VE SEEN IT RECENTLY SURE THE SUCCESSION PROCESS IF IT IS A SUCCESSION PROCESS. THAT IS FOLLOWED. IF THE SAME SUCCESSION PROCESS IS FOLLOWED FOR RESIGNING IS FALL FOR RECALL IT WOULD. POTENTIALLY DECREASED THE SAME CONFUSION. AND CHALLENGES THAT. WE HAVE- THAT WERE RICH REFER TO AS A STATEWIDE LAW. WAS TEN A GOVERNOR BEING ON THE BALLOT. THANK YES THEY YES. THANK YOU BENNETT I DON'T WEBBER I HAVE A- THE ARGUMENTS MADE. IMPAR COMMITTEE HERE THAT RICO A REALLY WERE AND THERE'S NO NEW TO CHANGE THIS QUO OR MAKE MAJOR. AT FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING YOU MADE A NUMBER OF POINTS ABOUT THE FLAWS IN THE- FULL THREE RECALL. AND I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THE URGENCY OF MAKING CHANGES TO THE RECALL FOLLOWING LAST YEAR AS WELL. I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK WE CAN WE CAN SAY THIS THIS THIS SITUATION ONLY HAPPENS ONCE EVERY. YOU KNOW WE CAN INITIALLY SAID IF THIS IS HAPPENING BUT NOBODY'S BEEN RECALLED OKAY OR THAT'S KIND OF THE CERTIFICATE. THE NOT QUALIFYING FOR THE BALLOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE DECISIONS NOW WHILE IT'S FRESH IN PEOPLE'S MINDS. BUT FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE RECALL INTO IT AND IT'S IN A TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IN FACT THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW. THEY HAD CHANGES THEY HAD IDEAS AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD DIDN'T GET TO THE BALLOT SO WHILE IT'S ON THE MINDS OF PEOPLE AND THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME DISCUSSIONS AND POSSIBLY SOME SOME REFORMS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO THAT IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT IS. BUT CLEARLY THE FLAWS THAT WE SEE IN IT THAT EVERYBODY AGREES TO THE ACTIONS EVERYONE SOME FOLKS DON'T THEY SEE THE FLOP THEY DON'T THINK IT'S- LARGE ENOUGH TO MAKE CHANGE. THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO- AND MOST FOLKS THAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND IT DIDN'T- AND- ISSUES- BOB. YOU KNOW ISSUES OF QUALIFICATIONS- WHAT IS QUALIFYING FOR PERSON TO RUN ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS CAME TO MY DESK. AND WILL AND I HAD TO NAVIGATE THE WITHOUT HAVING ANY- ANY SUPPORT NECESSARILY FROM THE LEGISLATURE TERMS OF THEM HAVING WRESTLE WITH THE SAME ISSUES BEFORE. AND RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SO WE'RE I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL THAT THAT THE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH. LEFT UP TO CHANCE OR TO WHO I WANTED TO PICK I WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE RULES TO MUCH. OF THE MAINLY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THIS WAS SOME MANIPULATION KIND OF GOING ON. BUT ISSUES- OF QUALIFICATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS RUNNING AND ALL THOSE KIN OF THINGS THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE JUST KIND OF LEFT OUT THERE AND SO- AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE APPALLED AT WHAT THEY SAW RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR- INTELLECTUAL BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR FARMERS OUR SYSTEM DOES PRODUCE AND SO- SO I THINK IT IS TIME TO YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A- IT'S A IT'S A GOOD TIME TO DO IT WHILE IT'S ON PEOPLE'S MINDS. PEOPLE CAN VOTE AGAINST IT THEY CAN BEFORE THEY HAVE TO. CONSTITUTIONAL. CHANGE BUT I THINK IT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO AND IS. NOT BE. SO THAT. I DO BUT I IT MAY. BE I DON'T KNOW IF OCT AT LEAST WITH. THE OF TIME. AND PRODUCE TIME CHANGED THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WANT. TO KIND OF HEAR. AND DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU HAD. A TO DO THAT BUT I THINK IT IS- WE SAW ONE A RECALL IN TWENTY THIRTEEN- TOOK TWO THOUSAND THREE WE SAW ONE THIS PAST YEAR. AND SOMEONE SAID WELL THAT'S WHAT EVERY FIFTEEN YEARS BUT WHO KNOWS IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER RECALL IN THE NEXT THREE FOUR YEARS. A WE DON'T KNOW I JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST ONE. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'LL BE ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS THEY MAY BE ANOTHER. TWO YEARS THREE YEARS WE DON'T KNOW- WE KNOW THAT THE PROCESS HAS CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY. IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO. WHO PUT RESOURCES AND MONEY UP THE RECALLS- BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE VENTURE THAT IT MAY HAPPEN MORE OFTEN THAN NORMALLY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. BUT JUST THE OFFICES AND PULLING OUT. SOME PAPERS TO DO A RECALL. THANK YOU DR RAINY. FINAL QUESTIONS ARE. FROM COME MEMBERS FOR MAKING SOME TIME TO BE A PART OF THIS JOINT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- WE'RE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAM PUT IN- AND I HOPE YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL REST OF YOUR DAY.

TO NOTICE THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS HAS LEFT- BUT I LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE VERY LEADERSHIP COMING IN AS AN APPOINTED SECRETARY OF STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE FACED WITH- THE CAST OF THE UPCOMING ELECTION IN A LECTURE HERE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECALL. WONDER WHAT KNOWLEDGE THEY LEADERSHIP. AND IT CREATING A FOR AND A LOT QUESTIONS ABOUT ELECTION.

SO AS I WAS MENTIONING IT KNOWLEDGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- LECTURES BUT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BOTH THE CHAIRS AND THE VICE YEARS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR TAKING ON THE TASK OF- LOOKING AT THE PROCESS IT TOOK PLACE IN. AND ASSEMBLY OF MAKING HIM. ARE WHICH IS NEVER AN EASY TASK BUT- BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE WORD ROCK C. AND WHAT OUR TECHNOLOGY BOTH THE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES. WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS I PREPARE THEIR TESTIMONY FOR THIS- FOR THIS PURPOSE. I WISH I COULD MEET AGAIN TO ALL USERS UPON EARLY SURVEY. AND LET ME JUST BACK UP FROM OF SOME- IT WE HAD TO S. AS WE MENTIONED IN A NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE HAD TO WAIT TIMES. AT THE END OF. FIELD VOTE- AND GOVERNMENT RECALL. AND YOU VERY DIFFERENT OUT IN OCTOBER THOUSAND THREE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE AND REPLACED BY ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR NUISANCE REMAINED IN OFFICE WITH THE 62% OF THE VOTE. TO RECALL HIM THE OUTCOMES WERE VERY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK I SEE SURVEYS CONDUCTED. BEFORE AND RIGHT NOW THE HE IN BOTH CASES CENTERS SHOWED STRONG SUPPORT FOR PROCESS CHANGES TO RECALL ELECTIONS- WHAT WHAT. WHAT DO WE KNOW FROM THE SURVEY CITY AND THAT WE CONDUCTED RIGHT AFTER THAT WE CALL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. L. AND YOU'RE A VERY PRO PROCESSES TWENTY ONE- OVERWHELMINGLY- THIS PAST NOVEMBER 79% OF LIKELY VOTERS SAID THAT THE RECENT RECALL US BASED MONEY STE ABOUT 70% ALSO SAID THAT- CHANGES WERE NEEDED IN THE RECALL PROCESS. STILL IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN CONTACT SAID 86% OF LIKELY VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA SAID THAT IS A GOOD THING THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR A TO YOUR CALL STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS SUCH AS GOVERNOR. SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU TODAY ABOUT OUR LATEST CONDUCTED FROM JANUARY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTH SO THAT ENDED ABOUT A WEEK AGO. FINALLY READING ON SUPPORT FOR POSSIBLE RECALL REFORMS ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BALLOT NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE- IN THIS SURVEY HAS BEEN INFORMED BY COMMON SIX SUGGESTIONS FROM A NUMBER OF POLICYMAKERS AND POLICY EXPERTS. BUT IT'S A SURVEY METHODS QUESTIONS AND CONTENT TO TERMINATE SOLELY BY PP I STUDENTS. SO FIRST ARE CALIFORNIANS TODAY IN TERMS OF- THEY'RE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE- THE RECALL PROCESS- THE LATEST EXPERIENCED. AT 39% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS SAID THAT IT MADE THEM FEEL WORSE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA. POLITICS AND ELECTIONS WHILE 18% SAID THAT IT MADE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT CALIFORNIA POLITICS AND ELECTIONS 40% SAID DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. MARK REPUBLICANS THEN INDEPENDENCE- I SAID THAT IT MADE HIM FEEL WORSE THEN IT HAPPENED AND- THEN IT FOR THE DEMOCRATS 54% OF REPUBLICANS 49% OF INDEPENDENCE. COMPARED 230% OF DEMOCRATS SAID THAT THAT THAT THE RECALL PROCESS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE ABOUT. CALIFORNIA POLITICS ELECTIONS. SO TO IT INFORM HIS FAMILY. WE ALSO HAVE AT THE REFORMS AND WE ASKED ABOUT TO KEEP PROPOSALS THAT THAT YOU. HEARD ABOUT THIS MORNING- AND SOME SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ON FIRST OF ALL THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT. THE SIGNATURE REQUIRED- ONE VERSION OF THIS REFORM WOULD CHANGE HIS SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT FROM 12% ELECTED WITH FOR THAT OFFICE CONTACTS AND IS A MEMBER RECALL ELECTION ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SIGNATURES WERE REQUIRED YOU TO QUALIFY WE EXPLAIN TO VOTERS THAT THIS CHANGE MEANT THAT HIGH STANDARD BEING. TWO POINT FIVE I MAY S. AS WE FIND WITH A LOT OF CIVIC PRESSURE ABOUT AROUND RECALL PERSON GROUPS WERE GET KEEP DIVIDED ON SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL 69% OF DEMOCRATS COMPARED 222% OF REPUBLICANS. AND 39% OF AND IN SUPPORTING THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL I ALSO MENTIONED THAT- THAT THERE WERE JUST 4% WERE UNDECIDED ON THIS PARTICULAR. THOSE LAWS THAT HAVE AN INTEREST PERCENT ACROSS FULL OP RIPS ANOTHER VERSION OF REFORM WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED CONGRESS WHAT CHANGING REQUIREMENTS 10% OF ALL REGISTERED VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA MILLION REQUIRED SIGNATURES FOR THEIR SEPTEMBER RECALL CURRENTLY FORTY THREE PERCENT. THIS CHANGE PARTISAN ONCE AGAIN DIVIDED BUT AFTER THE JOURNEY ACROSS PARTIES- NOT OF THIS BILL PROPOSAL 9% DEMOCRATS 37% REPUBLICANS AND FORTY FIVE PERCENT. OF INDEPENDENCE ONCE AGAIN- RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER WHO SAY THAT THEY HAVE NO OPINION FIVE PERCENT- YEAH IN THIS CASE 52% OF PUBLICLY VOTERS SAYING THAT THEY WERE A POST. SO THE MOVING ON TO A SECOND FORM COVERAGE OF REFORM PROPOSALS- HAVING TO DO WITH THE REPLACEMENT PROCESS- IN ARTICLE HE- LAST YEAR WE FOUND A NUMBER OF. LARGE NUMBER CALIFORNIANS SAYING THAT THEY SUPPORTED HAVING A TOP TWO RUNOFF- AND INDICATING THAT IT THAT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMATIC HELEN SPENT FROM THEIR STANDPOINT AND THE SECOND PART OF THE BALLOT TO REPLACE MY CLASSES SO WE- TESTED IN THIS CASE A COUPLE OF VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS CURRENTLY OF MILLIONS ALREADY WROTE YES ON PART ONE OF THE RECALL BALLOT. THE GOVERNOR'S LOOKS MODEST IN THE CANDIDATE WHO RECEIVES THE MOST VOTES ON PART TO THE POLICIES. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT SHOULD LEAD TENER GOVERNOR OVER FOR THE RE OF THE FOUR YEAR TERM. IF THE GOVERNOR'S RECALL CHANGE ONCE AGAIN PARTISAN TO DEEPLY DIVIDED SIXTY SEVEN SENATE DEMOCRATS 20% REPUBLICANS AND 40% OF INDEPENDENTS TAKE CARE. A SECOND FORM OF THIS- CHANGING REPORT REPLACEMENT PROCESS IS SIMILAR TO KEEP PERCENT SUPPORT ACCORDING TO LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO GOVERNOR AND HAVING A SPECIAL BALLOT MEASURE TO REPLACE THE GOVERNOR IN THE NEXT STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. AGAIN PARTICIPATING PROVIDED 66% DEMOCRATS 34% REPUBLICANS 43% OF THE INDEPENDENCE- HIM IN BOTH OF THOSE CASES FOR THE REPLACEMENT- THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT. WHAT WE- OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR POINT OUT THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE EVENTS ARE PLANNED. PLACE SMALL PERCENT- AND SAID. SO THE LAST NOT BE I WANT TO YOU I'M GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT ANOTHER QUESTION ASK ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOOD- RELEVANT THE WORK THAT THANK YOU OUT- NINE- HOW INTERESTED ARE LIKE. VOTERS THAT INTO. CHANGES SURGERY. WHEN TOLD THAT THERE IS A- HEARINGS I THERE ARE TWO. THAT WILL MAY RECOMMEND. THAT WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL 60% SAY THEY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE STATE PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THE RECALL. PROCESS ON THE BALLOT THIS YEAR THE REGION ISN'T DEMOGRAPHICS THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. 72% OF DEMOCRATS 55% OF INDEPENDENCE AND 47% OF REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE RECALLED WARMTH HELLO IS A LIST OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO ELECTION BALLOT. SO WHY IS THAT SO. THE GOVERNOR'S RECALL PROCESS PROCESS ILLUSTRATES AND RUNNER DILEMMA FOR A DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM THAT ASK FOR VOTERS TO WEIGH IN ON INITIATIVES REFERENDA AND RECALL. WHEN I WROTE A BOOK ON THE TWO THOUSAND THREE THE CALL I NOTED THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND- ALMOST. HAVE ALL PARTICIPATED IN IT. GOVERNANCE'S THAT IS STILL LESS THAN PERFECT. THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY MAKE REFORMS NECESSARY FOR MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OR WILL THEY A LOT OF THE SPIDER AND PERHAPS EVEN FELT IN SOME FUTURE. THE ENTIRE NAIL TO PENTAGON HOW MUCH IS FOR ARE WILL TO AT CHANGE. THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE VOTERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION OR FOLLOWING THE SCRIPTS OF THE TWO THOUSAND THREE RECALL THEY CAN IGNORE THE WARNING SIGNS AND. RISK POLITICAL CRISIS IN THE FUTURE. YES RECORD TO IN. DISCUSS ABOUT RECALL REFER. EXPLORATION OR ASSESSOR. THIS YEAR IN MEETINGS AS THIS ONE TODAY. AND FOLLOWING RECALL RECALL. THAT MAKE IT OUT TO THE TWENTY TO ABOUT. GOOD RECALLS ARE RARE AND STATE FROM. JUST TO CHANGE THE CALIFORNIA CONCEPT. ARE COMPLEX BUT THE IF FUNCTIONING DIRECTOR IS A SERIOUS MATTER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALKED ABOUT THE SORRY FOR THAT A WONDERFUL RESENTATION AND FOR YOUR ON GOING WORK TO PROVIDED PUBLIC INSIGHT TO OUR POLICY MAKING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA GO FOR QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE PANEL OF FIRST GOING TO. TURN THE CHAIR BRIAN FOR HIS QUESTION THANK YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT A SITE THAT WAS. INCREDIBLY INSIGHTFUL- AND AS MINE COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE MENTIONED YOUR EFFORTS AROUND THIS WORK NOW SPANNING. DECADES DEDICATED TO POLLING OF VOTERS ON THE RECALL AT I THINK OF SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE INFORMED THE PROCESS EARLIER THAN NOW BUT I'M GLAD WE COULD UP LIFTED HEARING HEARING LIKE THIS. YOU MENTIONED THAT GOING FROM 12% 220% THE VOTER THRESHOLD GOT 50% SUPPORT AND THAT YOU EXPLAINED HOW MANY TOTAL VOTES THAT CHANGE WOULD BE FOR VOTERS. AND THE QUESTION ABOUT GOING FROM 10% OF REGISTERED VOTERS- FROM 12% IN THE LAST ELECTION WAS THE% NOMINAL CHANGE IN TOTAL VOTES EXPLAINED BECAUSE THAT RECOMMENDATION I'VE HEARD HAS ALSO BEEN UPLIFTED BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND IT'S GETTING SOME TRACTION AND SOME CURIOUS TO WHAT EXTENT- IN YOUR POLL. FOLKS WERE EXPLAIN KIND OF THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN IN TOTAL VOTE. SO WE EXPLAIN IN TOTAL GROSS WHAT WAS NEEDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WATER WITH ME IF YOU CHANGES TO- EITHER- THE TWENTY PERCENT. THRESHOLD OR AT THE 10% WE GAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS. WHICH IS THE POOREST MORE THAN WHAT PROBABLY IN APPEARANCE A BALLOT MEASURE BUT WE JUST FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF CONTEXT- SO THAT PEOPLE KNEW THAT IT MEANT THAT THEY WOULD LET 10% ACTUALLY MEANT BUT THERE'D BE MORE. OF BOTH REQUIRED THEN AT 12% AND IN THE PAST SELECTIONS- AND SIMILARLY THAT 20% THAT. WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MORE. THANK YOU AND THEN AND THEN MINE MY SECOND QUESTION AND ALL OF THE POLLING THAT YOU'VE DONE THROUGH THE YEARS ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC. IS THERE ANY. PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S BEEN SHAED BY VOTERS THAT. YOU FIND TO BE THE MOST SALIENT AND MOST IMPORTANT FOR US TO REFLECT ON FOLLOWING THIS YEAR. I DO AND- IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO EXACTLY WHAT THE PROPOSAL FUNDRAISER MOST WANT TO HEAR BUT LAST YEAR WE ASKED THE QUESTION IN ON NOVEMBER SURVEY ACT OUT- IF THERE WAS A COMMISSION- THAT WAS BIPARTISAN AND HELD HEARINGS AND PROVIDED. RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH THE VOTERS ABOUT DECIDE WE SAW A CALIFORNIA LIKELY VOTERS MANY DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS AGREEING THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY THEY COULD SUPPORT AND THAT THEY WANT TO SEE. AND SIMILARLY IN THAT IN THIS CURRENT GOAL THE THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH NOW IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD- THEY THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA IT. OKAY THE SUCH AS YOURS PROVIDES SOME- SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL THAT WILL VOTERS WILL BE ABLE TO CONSIDER ON THE BALLOT LATER IN THE YEAR WE SOUGHT NEARLY HALF OF REPUBLICANS- SEVENTEEN TEN DEMOCRATS MAJORITY LOOKING DEPEND SAYING. THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA. THAT MEANS THAT- THE HARD WORK AND LEADERSHIP THAT WE'RE SEEING- IT IT THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TODAY OR SOMETHING THAT THAT THE VOTERS WELCOME BECAUSE THE VOTERS THINK VERY HIGHLY OF THIS PROCESS- BUT HAVING TO RECALL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. THEY BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT A PERFECT ONE THAT'S CHANGES ARE MADE EIGHT ARE NEEDED AND THEY ARE LOOKING TO YOU FOR SOME- SOME LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF WHAT COULD MAKE THIS PROCESS- ALL. BUDGET AS THE FACT THAT WE AS POSS. I CURRENTLY. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT- THANK YOU FOR MUCH SIR. OF I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ON MY SCREEN JUST POP GIVE ME ONE SECOND THERE WE GO- AND THAT IS YOU MENTIONED- A DOCTOR THAT IS RARE- AND THAT WE'VE HAD BUT TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE HERE IN THIS FIELD THAT PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS ARE LIKELY TO MAKE RECALL ELECTIONS MUCH LESS RARE THAN THEY WERE IN THERE AND THEY'LL- OVERALL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IN OTHER WORDS ARE WE HAVE. IT WHERE WE HAD A PERIOD WHERE RECALL ELECTIONS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN THAN THE HISTORICAL. AVERAGE. I YEAH THAT'S A HARD QUESTION FOR ME TO ANSWER- AND- I THINK THAT ALL OF THAT- I- COMMITTEE MIGHT HERE THIS- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THAT THAT PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS- CLEARLY CHANGES THE DYNAMICS OF. OF NATURAL RECALLS BUT REFERENDA AND INITIATIVES WHICH ARE ACTUALLY MORE COMMON. THAN CITYWIDE RECALLS WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MANY MORE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY- AND WHEN MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO VOTED. SAID THAT WERE IN THE PAST SO IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SORT OF YOU KNOW MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF OUR PAID RECALL OF PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS EXCEPT AS NAY THAT- IN IN MOST CASES WE KNOW THAT. THAT THAT- ITEMS GETTING TO THE STATEWIDE BALLOT WITHOUT PAYING SIGNATURE. GATHERERS WHAT. WITH WOULD BE WITH RARE TO OF. THE MILLIONS OF SIGNATURES ARE NEEDED TO MAKE ABOUT. TO THE THAT A OF. RECALL IS BAY ON TRULY ACT BY AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHICH- HOPEFULLY WOULD MOTIVATE MANY PEOPLE TO WANT TO SIGN THE RECALL. IT IT TO. LEADS ME TO THIS QUESTION AND THEN THAT I GUESS OBSERVATION AND LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND THAT IS IF WE MAKE A CHANGE TO- THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TAKING OVER PROPOSALS THAT IS OUT THERE. IT SEEMS THAT IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE INCENTIVE FOR MINORITY CANDIDATES TO FUND- RECALL EFFORTS BECAUSE MINORITY CANDIDATES WHO REALIZED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO WIN A MAJORITY VOTE AND A REGULAR COOLEY SCHEDULED GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION. VIEW THE RECALL PROCESS AS A WAY FOR THEM TO- TAKE THE SEAT- WITHOUT EARNING A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE MADE THIS CHANGE THE LOOKS TENTATIVE GOVERNOR ASPECT IT SEEMS TO ME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT IT WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE INCENTIVE AND THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT WOULD FLOW BECAUSE- YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THESE MINORITY CANDIDATES IN THEIR FUNDRAISING MACHINES FUNDING HELPING TO FUND RECALL CAMPAIGNS. IF THEY COULDN'T THEN USE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME A MINORITY ELECTED A GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. COULD YOU OFFER YOUR THE THIS SAGE OPINION ON THAT IF YOU ARE WILLING RIGHT. HI I CAN OPERATE AT WHETHER IT'S SAFE OR NOT IT'S IT IS BASED ON WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT VOTER INTEREST FROM THE DATE YOU BECAUSE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BASEBALL. I THINK IN. IN S. SOMEBODY WHO DOES WORK IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLING AND YOU KNOW THE BIG QUESTION AROUND ELECTIONS HE'S ALWAYS VOTER TURNOUT AND- THE FACT THAT- GLOBAL GOVERNMENT IS MEATBALLS ARE SPECIAL ELECTIONS- THURS YOU KNOW EXCEPT THAT RISKY RECEPTION. THAT THESE COULD BE LOW VOTER TURNOUT. ACTIVITIES AND WE HEARD THAT AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE RUN ELECTION WE HEARD THAT THE THREE THOUSAND THREE ELECTIONS THIS SUMMER DEGREE WE WERE ARE WE UNDER. THE LEVEL OF INTEREST. BUT ALSO THE- THAT PEOPLE PLACE CUNNINGHAM CALL BECAUSE THREE LAW AND I THINK WHAT WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE TWENTY. ONE A LOT. IS IF THERE IS GOVERNOR BEFORE. THAT PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE GOING TO. THE ISN'T WORK AND THEY'RE GONNA GO LARA NUMBER YEAH CANDIDATES WHO WOULD EXPECT OTHERWISE I THINK WE'LL BE SURPRISED TO LEARN. THAT THIS IS ELECTIONS THAT WILL NOT JUST GET GREAT MEDIA INTEREST BUT THAT THE MOTORS WILL PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IN THE CASE OF LAST YEAR- WHERE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS WERE GOING ON COLD IT CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY WITH THE GROUND OUT US- THE RECALL ELECTION. WAS CENTER STAGE REPORTERS PEOPLE WHEN THEY THINK VOTE IS IMPORTANT. AND GOVERNMENT'S RECALLS. WE NOW TO- WE WILL BE- PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ABOUT THEIR- IN THE SELECTION. AND THEY'RE GONNA SHOW UP. IN YOUR YOUR POLLING DOES INDICATE THAT. PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A MINORITY CANDIDATE BEING ELECTED IN THAT RECALL PROCESS CORRECT. YES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STEP BACK NOW YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND THREE AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE GREAT CALL WHAT'S THAT IN BETWEEN THAT TIME- CALIFORNIA WENT TO A- CHU PRIMARY SYSTEM AS AS A PUBLICLY- UNLESS THAT AND UNLESS LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE ACT. AND SO- AND VOTERS SUPPORTED THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THEY CAME TO THE BALLOT AND VOTERS SAID WE WANT THE TOP TWO PRIMARY SYSTEM WE WANT. THE PERSON WHO GETS THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES TO BE ELECTRIC SO WHEN I ASKED WHY CELESTE YEAR ABOUT- WHETHER PEOPLE SUPPORTED A RUN OFF WITH THE TOPIC I GETS LISTEN TALK TO WHAT WE SAW SOLID MAJORITY SUPPORT BOTH TIMES WERE. CHANGING THE RECALL SYSTEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN CONTEXT THAT THAT IS ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE VOTERS SUPPORTED AT THE BALLOT BOX WE WENT TO A TOP TWO PRIMARY SYSTEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEEN. VERY HELPFUL REALLY PUSHING THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONSI REQUEST THINK YES VICE. WE ARE JUST. I HAVE A CUP OF QUESTIONS- WANTED ABOUT THE SAME REQUIREMENT OTHER ONE IS ABOUT- PROBABLY THE FINE PART OF THIS- I- BENNETT HAS BROUGHT UP A VERY. POINT ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO ACCESS IT AND RUN IN A RECALL ELECTION. AS FAR AS A SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT EARLY ON IN OUR HEARINGS WE HEARD IN MY MIKE ON. OKAY THANK YOU- EARLY ON IN OUR HEARINGS WE HEARD FROM A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY. WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT AND HE MENTIONED THAT. TAKING IT FROM 12% 220% WOULD. TAKE SOMETHING THAT IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN HIS TERMS AND MAKE IT EXTINCT AND IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD MAKE IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT. BOTH FROM A FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL STANDPOINT FOR PEOPLE WHO WISH TO ENGAGE IN A RECALL PROCESS TO ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH IT AND THEREFORE MAKING IT BE DISCOURAGING THEM FROM DOING SO- WHICH IS SOMETHING I THINK WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM IS DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM- THAT PARTICIPATING IN THE VOTING PROCESS. I DO AGREE WITH THEM OR WOULD YOU DIFFER WITH THAT AND IN SAY IT WOULDN'T MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. TODAY IT'S EXTENT SAID IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE FEEL SOMETHING'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO HELLO DON'T TRY TO GET THERE BUT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE PERCEPTION OF THE VOTERS SAID IT'S YOU MAKING SOMETHING THAT'S DIFFICULT- MORE DIFFICULT. AND I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW. RESTATE THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE TODAY WHICH I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS- THROUGH TO ALL OF US WHO WERE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN TENSE HEARING TODAY WE WERE WE LIVE IN A TIME IN WHICH- ALEXION'S ELECTION REFORMS ARE SOMETHING THAT THE VOTERS ARE ARE HEARING ABOUT- YEMENPRESS IN REPUBLICANS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELECTION REFORMS SO- I AMTHERE THEY'RE FEELING ALL ACTION REFORMS AS THROUGH ACCIDENTS LANCE AND- THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THEM- I THINK LOOK. VERY CLEAR AND WHATEVER IS FARMS WOULD COME OUT OF- COMMITTEE HEARINGS THEIR WORK OR COMMISSIONS OR SIGNS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT PARTY TRYING TO GAIN ANY OVER THE OTHER BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT- THESE EASIER CAMPERS THAT ARE BEING MADE. TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY SO WERE REFORMS TO GET THAT KIND OF SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT THAT- THAT THEY WERE NEEDING CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD NEED TO BE CUTE **** REALLY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE DEMOCRACY- HANNAH'S FUNCTIONING- HIGH AND PEOPLE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR SIGNS THAT- WELL ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED AGREED THAT THESE CHANGES ARE THE ONES THAT WILL BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF. CALIFORNIA'S DIRECT DEMOCRACY SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND REVOLVES AROUND THE FINANCE PART OF THIS AND- TO ENGAGE IN- TRYING TO ATTEMPT A RECALL. TO BE A CANDIDATE IN THE RECALL IS EXPENSIVE AND THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND FUND RAISING THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO- FOR CAMPAIGN SPENDING LIMITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- WHEREAS A PERSON BEING ORG RECALLED IS NOT. AND DOES SO THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS THE DAVEY IN THE ROOM THAT GETS A MILLION DOLLARS. AND IS THERE ANY TALK ABOUT THAT TYPE OF REFORM THAT WOULD HELP LEVEL THAT PLAYING FIELD- SO THAT- IF PEOPLE THAT ARE. AYE I MEAN SO THE PERSON THAT IS BEING RECALLED HAS THE SAME CAMPAIGN LIMITS AS THE- PEOPLE THAT ARE. TRYING TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM. ACCESS THE VOTING- ALEXION SYSTEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY- YOU KNOW. PROPOSAL SO THAT SOARED NOR. THAT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED- HUH I MAKING NOTED LESS WORK FOR FUTURE POLLING THAT YOU GUYS THINK RIGHT AND IT THAT ANSWERED MY OTHER QUESTION IS ANYBODY HAVE YOU RECALLED ANY POLLING ON IT AND SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT. I COULD NOT AT THIS POINT BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- BEING SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED YOU'RE MORE ABOUT. INPUT THING AND- THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU- TO. BYE SHARE C. R. TOO I APPRECIATED IN PARTICULAR YOUR FIRST QUESTION. BECAUSE IT POINTED OUT THAT WE HAD A WITNESS. TO OUR HEARING EARLIER THAT WAS CRITICAL OF CHANGES IN THE RECALL IT WAS SUGGESTED EARLIER THAT SOME HAVE. THE WITNESSES WERE INVALID SO I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THAT AND REMINDING US OF THAT. OF THAT TESTIMONY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR DR BARBARA SORRY. I HAVE ONE- IN IN YOUR IN YOUR SURVEY WORK THAT YOU DID IN NOVEMBER. ONE OF THE FINDINGS OF A QUESTION YOU ASKED IS THE RECALL ON THE CHANGE. 50% OF THE PEOPLE SAID MAJOR CHANGE 28% SAID MINOR CHANGE TO SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT. AT THAT POINT IN TIME. I WANTED TO ASK YOU OF. ABOUT THIS- THE THIS TREND- EIGHT GIVEN THE SURVEY WORK THAT YOU'VE JUST COMPLETED IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S LESS INTEREST IN RECALL THAT THERE WAS IT EVEN HAS SAID RECENTLY AS NOVEMBER AND OBVIOUSLY IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT. ANY KIND OF REFORM ON AN UPCOMING BALLOT IT WOULD HAPPEN MANY MONTHS INTO THE FUTURE. CAN YOU SPEAK THE WHAT YOU THINK THIS MEANS OUR VOTERS- DISTRACTED BY OTHER THINGS I. DON'T SEE THE SAME URGENCY THAT THEY SAW NOVEMBER HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE. THE CHANGE IN MOOD AND WHAT THAT MEANS GOING FORWARD. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR GLAZERS AND- DESERVE IT WILL BE RELEASING THAT TOMORROW WILL PROVIDE IN A CONTEXT THAT WILL PRODUCE ARE TODAY BUT IT THEIR CONCERNS BUT OBVIOUSLY THEIR CONCERNS AROUND- OKAY THE ECONOMY HOMELESSNESS- HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRYING- ALL THINKS THAT I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT FROM CONSTITUENTS. WHICH HAVE YOU KNOW TAKEN TAKEN CENTER STAGE THIS YEAR AND- LAST YEAR WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR SUBS YOU KNOW START FINAL POLLS I DIDN'T MENTION THAT- YOU KNOW. VOTERS WILL- YOU KNOW THIS ELECTION HAVING AND THEN THERE'S A RECALL HAVING THEN COMPLETED- AND FOR- THE OUTCOME- MUCH TO WHAT- YOU KNOW WE EXPECTED IN THE POLLING THAT MANY VOTERS MOVE ON OTHER CONCERTS- AND- THAT I THINK IS. IT AS FAR IT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE CON IS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY BUT I ONCE AGAIN I'LL POINT TO THE FACT THAT SIXTY PERCENT. SAID THAT YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT HEARINGS THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING SOMETHING THAT THE VOTERS CAN CONSIDER AND WEBER- IS SOMETHING THAT- THAT 60% OF VOTERS STATURE NAY SAYING IT'S A GOOD IDEA- MAYBE IT HAD WOOD WE'RE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER. IN NOVEMBER BUT THERE IS STILL LOT OF VOTERS WHO RUN TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROCESS WHICH IS A NEW THAT MICROPHONE ISSUES THEY THINK THE IMPORT. OF THE OUTCOME IS VERY GREAT CLERK FOR THE STATE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO BE SURE- IT'S BEEN LOOKED AT AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. NOW IS THE TIME TO PICK SIX.

WITH GRAY DAVIS. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO ASK THE COMMITTEE DO YOU ANY OF YOU KNOW WE'RE THE SURVEYS THAT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'LL NEED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST I BELIEVE PP I SEE IS GOING TO ISSUE A BLOG POST TODAY. I AND PUT PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS ON THEIR ON THEIR WEBSITE AS THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE ON ON ON THE STATE ON THE- ON ON HERE ON THE STATE'S. WEBSITE OR THE GOING TO BE IN THE VOTER REGISTRATION OFFICES IN EACH COUNTY. IT'LL BE ON THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA'S% WEBSITE OKAY RIGHT I GET THAT PARTISAN THING OKAY. I'M GONNA EXPLAIN SOMETHING WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO ASK ABOUT RAISING THE PERCENTAGE OF THE RECALL I MAY GO BACK TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHE SAID SUPPOSEDLY THE CURVE IT. STOPPED AND WE HAD A JUDGE APPROVED THE SECOND PART THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED SHE SAID SUPPOSEDLY IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED NOTHING WAS OPEN WE WERE ALL ON LOCKDOWN EVERYBODY WAS REMOTE YOU GUYS WERE EVEN REMOTE. SO ALL OF THIS BUT IT CONTINUES TO BE TALKED ABOUT MEMBERS JIM AND IT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT HERE'S MY LAST COMMENT THANK YOU KNOW SCHOOL IS TEACHING FIT IN ORDER KEEPING PEOPLE IGNORANT AND YOU KNOW WHAT AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS MAX BRUNNEA- AND I THINK THAT BY MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RECALL BEING UNDEMOCRATIC IN NATURE YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THAT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNOR. THIS IS THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD FOR A LONG TIME. SHIFTING AROUND THE QUALIFICATIONS IN THE RULES EVERY NOW AND THEN IS LIKE BARRING PEOPLE FROM RUNNING. THE FIRST QUESTION A SHELL EX GOVERNOR TO BE RECALLED. AS LONG AS A 50% PLUS ONE SAY YES THE CANDIDATE WITH THE MOST VOTES IN THE SECOND SECTION WHO SHALL REPLACE EX GOVERNOR ASSUMES THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR. A PLURALITY VOTE IS THE PROCESS WE USE IN OUR PRIMARIES IT'S A PROCESS USED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA TO ELECT THEIR OFFICIALS THAT ALLOW CITIZENS TO RECALL THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. IF WE TAKE THAT AWAY WE REMOVE ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATE LEVEL. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SAYS AND I QUOTE RECALL IS THE POWER OF ELECTORS TO REMOVE AN ELECTED AN ELECTIVE OFFICER. MAX THAT'S ONE MINUTE BUT THANK YOU I THINK IT'S REALLY POWERFUL WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE COME AND GIVE TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR THAT. BRIDE PLASTER COUNTY IN THE WORDS OF JIM NIELSEN FROM THAT THE OCTOBER RECALL REFORM CARING CAN WE LOWER THE MIKE FROM AS WE GRAPPLE. LET GO. OKAY OKAY IN THE WORDS OF JIM NIELSEN THANK YOU JIM THE INITIATIVE AND THE REFERENDUM AND THE RECALL A VERY SACRED DIRECT DEMOCRACY OPPORTUNITIES REALLY PERFECTED IN THE STATE AND LET'S NOT TRIVIALIZE THOSE I AGREE WITH JIM NIELSEN THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO CHANGE THE RECALL CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE NINETEEN STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT PERMITS THE RECALL OF STATE OFFICIALS CALIFORNIA AND COLORADO ARE UNIQUE IN RIO HAVING THE RECALL AND REPLACE IN ONE. ELECTION THIS SEEMS THE MORE WE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BEST OPTION LET'S PICK OUR BATTLES LEAVE THE RECALL ALONE WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE BY HAVING TO ELECTIONS. WE THE PEOPLE NEED TO RETAIN OUR EXISTING CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO RECALL STATE OFFICIALS THE RECALL PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA IS A WELL OILED MACHINE. AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT SPENDING TAX DOLLARS CHANGING OUR CONSTITUTION REGARDING THE RECALL IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEACE PEOPLE THANK YOU THAT'S ONE TALK ABOUT ELECTION INTEGRITY LETTER. WRITING ID MAIL IN VOTING AND DOMINION MACHINES WE THE PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO SACRIFICE OUR VOTER RIGHTS THANK YOU MS MCBRIDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YES SIR ORNATELY THE CHAIRMAN OF REBUILD CALIFORNIA DOT COM AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE WAS SEVEN ATTEMPTS TO RECALL ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WHERE WAS YOUR- YOU KNOW HIGHER THAN AND THE RECALL PROCESS IS THE ONLY THING LEFT THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE TO HOLD YOU FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE YOU WERE ELECTED TO REPRESENT AND THE FARTHER YOU WANDER AWAY FROM THAT OBLIGATION AND FROM. YOUR YOUR FROM YOUR THOMAS TO THE PEOPLE TO REPRESENT THEM THE MORE YOU WISH TO END THE RECALL PROCESS BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT'S LEFT TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE SO I AGREE WITH MISTER NELSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- SUPPORTING THE RECALL PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION.

PARENTS WHO WANT TO STAND UP FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS IN OUR FREEDOMS. I MEAN YOU GUYS SHOULD BE STANDING WITH US NOT AGAINST US. SO THE RECALL IS OUR RIGHT. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT WHEN THEY'RE- ADELINE IT'S UP TO US TO KEEP THEM IN LINE. IS ALWAYS YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT WHAT YOU GUYS WHO ARE BEHIND THESE THAT'S RIGHT NOW.

THANK YOU MODERATOR AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD ALREADY PASSED THE REMOTE INFORMED THAT THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES OUTSIDE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT DURING THIS PROCESS ESPECIALLY IT BEING OUR THIRD INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT WE GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SELL WITNESSES AND REMOTE TESTIMONY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU AS WELL. YOU EACH HAVE ONE MINUTE. HEY CAN YOU SEE ME YES WE CAN OKAY SO YOU CAN SEE ME- AND IS THIS RECALL HEARING. DO I JUST START TALKING YES AND IT'S AN OKAY. START BY SAYING I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT- THE CHAIR THIS NEW CHAIR BRIAN- IS CHAIRING A COMMITTEE LAST TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN YOU DIDN'T EVEN STAY FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WARRANTS YOU BECOMING CHAIROF THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU KNOW IS TALKING ABOUT STRIPPING OUR OUR BASIC RIGHT TO HAVE RECALL ELECTIONS. THE PERSON YOU HAVE SURELY WEBER WHO WAS YOUR MAIN WITNESS WAS NOT EVEN A LACK DID BY THE PEOPLE SHE WAS APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM SO WHY IS YOUR EXPERTS. YOU KNOW THAT WAS APPOINTED BY A GOVERNOR THANK YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CLEARLY BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH WHAT. OFF DID THEY CUT ME OFF- THAT SO FROM. HELLO MY NAME IS JIM EMONDS- I JUST THINK IT'S WRONG THAT YOU TAKE AWAY OUR RIGHT TO RECALL A GOVERNOR YEAH MY ON- IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO. TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT TO RECALL A GOVERNOR WHO'S NOT DOING ITS JOB IS NOT FOLLOWING WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. AND THAT THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY IT IS IDEA I'M I'M NOT SOLO WITH THIS ITEM I THINK THEIR MASSES AGREE WITH ME- AND EAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE AWAY THAT RIGHT- ANYWAY THAT'S IT THANK YOU MUCH. ALL RIGHT. WELL THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN FUN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN TODAY'S HEARING ARE TWO EXPERT WITNESSES MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAIR GLAZIER. I ALSO WANT TO OPEN UP THE FLOOR BEFORE WE ADJOURN ARE THERE ANY REMARKS THAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH TO MAKE- IN OUR BRIEF CLOSING. STATISM BENNETT- THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. IT JERRY BRYAN. OF THE QUESTION AT THE OPENING OF THIS WORLD SOME PEOPLE QUESTION THE NEED FOR REFORM OF THE RECALL PROCESS AT ALL. AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTIONIS YES THAT WITH PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS OUT THERE. RECALLS HAVE BECOME DOMINATED. BY THOSE WHO WANT TO USE THE RECALL PROCESS FOR NARROW. POLITICAL INTEREST RATHER THAN FOR WHAT THEY'RE DESIGNED FOR WHICH IS- TO REMOVE FROM OFFICE PEOPLE THAT ENGAGE IN EGREGIOUS- OF MISCONDUCT OR SERIOUS ETHICAL VIOLATIONS AND THAT ARE OUT THERE. WILL GIVE TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT AND ONE IS A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THEY CAN ONLY WIN. IN A RECALL ELECTION THAT STARDOCK DESIGNED TO ALLOW A CANDIDATE WHO GETS A PERHAPS SMALL NARROW SLICE OF THE VOTES TO BECOME. THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA- THAT IS A MOTIVATION FOR SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND FUNDS TO FLOW IN TO RECALL CAMPAIGNS. THE SECOND IN THAT ONE THAT WE SEE VERY MUCH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE PEOPLE WHO AT A LOCAL LEVEL HAVE KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE OF- OF THE PREVIOUS MISCONDUCT OR ETHICAL VIOLATIONS. BUT SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH A POLITICAL OF POSITION TAKEN BY A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER CITY COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP PROVIDES OUR EXETER- AND- WHILE THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT- OF. PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS ALLOW THOSE PEOPLE TO ALSO- GATHERED THE SIGNATURES OFTEN WEST OF MISREPRESENTATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE GATHERING AND I THINK WE WE'VE ALL SEEN PLENTY OF THOSE EXAMPLES. SO I. WOULD OFFER THAT I SUPPORT THE CLARITY THAT COMES. FROM IDENTIFYING FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE THE PERSON THAT'S GOING TO BE RECALL. THE CLARITY. THAT COMES FROM- THIS HANG. THE LOCAL PROCESS WE BE. A RE. OR THREE PLACEMENT IF SOMEBODY IS RECALLED IS THE SAME AS IF IT AND IF SOMEBODY RESIGNS BECAUSE THAT CLARITY DECREASES THE INCENTIVE FOR MINORITY CANDIDATES TO TRY TO PUSH THROUGH A RECALL AND I THINK THAT WITH THAT SINGLE CHANGE. WE WILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASE- THE INCENTIVES AND THEREFORE- THE FREQUENCY OF INAPPROPRIATE- RECALL EFFORTS THAT THAT WOULD BE OUT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF BORDER THANK IS A NUMBER INSTEAD OF BY CHERYL. I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR. TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO REVIEW A PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA- SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO REVIEW. AND EVERYBODY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE SHOULD BE REVIEWING PROCESSES EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THERE ARE SO MANY PROCESSES IN AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT FUNCTIONAL THAT WE SHOULD BE REVIEWING AND THIS IS PROBABLY ON THE SCALE OF ALL OF THEM- NOTNEARLY AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST- BUT AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS. AND LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY AND THINGS. ARE THEIR IDEAS TO CHANGE ANYTHING CAN BE CHANGED BUT WE HAVE TO WAY OUT IS THAT CHANGE NECESSARILY- SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROCESS OR NOT. AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I TAKE- ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE. VERY VERY SERIOUSLY- SO- THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING IN THIS AND- I APPRECIATE TO EVERY YOU KNOW THE TIME THAT PEOPLE PUT IN. AND SPEND HERE- BUT- I ALSO APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS FROM FRUSTRATED PEOPLE OUT THERE- THAT ARE AFRAID THAT WE ARE GOING DOWN THE WRONG PATH. AND BACK ON THE UC BERKELEY A GENTLEMAN ACTUALLY HE WAS IN FAVOR OF CHANGING THE RECALL PROCESS HE JUST OFFERED AN OPINION ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM. THAT A DEFERRED WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT- HAVE. HAVE TALKED ABOUT- THE SIGNATURE PROCESS. THANKS FOR CLARIFICATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED THANK YOU ALL.
