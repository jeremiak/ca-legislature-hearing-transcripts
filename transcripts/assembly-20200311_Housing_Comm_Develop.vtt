NOT CREATE ANOTHER- IF YOU WANT

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:23.301
TO SAY- INSTITUTION- BECAUSE I

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:25.903
DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO. WE

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:26.637
WANT TO HAVE A FOCUS BUT WE

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.473

SHELL. OR FOR THAT BUILDING I

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.151
DON'T. KNOW I AM I THINK THAT

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:43.421
BIAS BY CREATING ONE OFFICE ONE

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:44.822
ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:47.058
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- IT WOULD

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:49.127
ACTUALLY UP STREAMLINE THE

THE GOVERNOR COULD DO THAT

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:34.739
EIGHT DOLLARS OFF SWITCH IT ON

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:37.742

GOVERNOR'S DOT THAT'S BEEN

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:52.917

RUNNING A THIRTY PROGRAMS

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:46.037

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:53.144
PROMISES ARE I DO THINK THIS

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.012
KIND OF A BILL COULD PROVIDE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.581

OBJECTIVES. YOU KNOW FOR MY

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:02.520
PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE AT LEAST

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:05.122
THREE THINGS WE NEED TO MOVE

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:06.958
