JANUARY TWENTY SECOND TO SATURDAY IS THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING IN ROE VERSUS WADE THAT RULING DEFINE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AS A RIGHT THAT INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. BEFORE ROE VERSUS WADE. ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION AMERICANS RESORTED TO AN ILLEGAL ABORTION EVERY YEAR. I WAS FORTUNATE TO BEGIN MY REPRODUCTIVE YEARS NEAR THE TIME OF THE ROE V. WADE DECISION AS A RESULT I HAD ACCESS TO ALL OF THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES I NEEDED I DID NOT HAVE TO FACE THE SHAME THE COST OF THE POTENTIALLY LETHAL CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING AN ILLEGAL ABORTION. BEFORE ROE V. WADE WOMEN RISKED THEIR LIVES. ILLEGAL ABORTIONS COST UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DEATHS ANNUALLY. AND MANY OTHER HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. LIKE MANY MANY PEOPLE. I GOT PREGNANT UNINTENTIONALLY A PREGNANCY I HAD NOT PLANNED FOR. I CAN DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IN MANY RESPECTS THERE IN MATERIAL WHETHER IT WAS FAILED BIRTH CONTROL SEX I DIDN'T CHOOSE. WRONG TIME IN MY LIFE OR A RELATIONSHIP I DIDN'T INTEND TO HAVE. REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT UNINTENTIONAL PREGNANCY. FORTUNATELY THEY WERE NOT LEGAL OR OTHER OBSTACLES BEFORE ME. INSTEAD I WAS ABLE TO WEIGH MY SITUATION AND MAKE THE VERY PERSONAL DECISION TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AN ABORTION I HAD. AND I DO NOT REGRET. IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED AT THE TIME AND WAS ABLE TO I WAS ABLE TO GET THAT CARE AT A SAFE HEALTH CARE SETTING. TODAY HOWEVER AN INCREASINGLY OVER THE LAST DECADE. WE ARE AND HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING AN ONGOING RELENTLESS ATTACK. ON ABORTION ACROSS THE NATION. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO TEXAS PASSED SB EIGHT. BY BANNING ABORTIONS AFTER SIX WEEKS THE TIME PERIOD THAT MOST DON'T EVEN REALIZE YET THEY ARE PREGNANT. S. B. EIGHT IN FACT UNDERMINES ROVI WAY AND JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT WHO HAVE PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR OPPOSITION TO ABORTION HAVE FOR NOW LET S. B. EIGHT STAND. MISSISSIPPI FLORIDA AND DOZENS OF OTHER STATES ARE POISED TO FOLLOW SUIT. IF THOSE SAME JUSTICES VOTE TO OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE OR CONTINUE TO ALLOW BANDS LIKE ESP EIGHT TO REMAIN. ON OVER HALF THE STATES IN THE US WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE WHICH COULD IMPACT OVER THIRTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE WHO COULD BECOME PREGNANT. S. R. SIXTY THREE HONORS THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE AND REAFFIRMS CALIFORNIA'S OUR STATE'S LEADERSHIP ROLE AS A NATIONAL LEADER FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. I URGE YOU TO VOTE ON SR SIXTY THREE YES BUT- MADAM PRO TEM ADKINS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ALEX I RISE ALSO IN SUPPORT AND IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SENATE RESOLUTION SIXTY THREE A RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING A CRITICALLY DEFINING MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING ON JANE ROE L. VERSUS HENRY WADE. THE LANDMARK DECISION DETERMINED THAT A PREGNANT PERSON'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO HAVE A SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION IS A LIBERTY AS STATED BY THE AUTHOR. BY THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. YET DESPITE THIS CLEAR RULING THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS PROTECTED BY HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY NOT A DAY HAS GONE BY IN THE LAST FORTY NINE YEARS. WHEN ABORTION RIGHTS HAVE NOT BEEN UNDER THREAT. NO MORE SO THAN TODAY. AS WE SPEAK OTHER STATES ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH POLICIES TO RESTRICT ABORTION ACCESS AND ESTABLISH UNITIVE LEGAL STRUCTURES TO INTIMIDATE. AND DISENFRANCHISE PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE ABORTION. THE THREAT OF THESE POLICIES IS ONLY MAGNIFIED WHEN WE CONSIDER THE RECENT COURT RULINGS AS ALSO INDICATED AT EVERY LEVEL AND THE DELIBERATIONS OCCURRING AT OUR SUPREME COURT. WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND WE KNOW WHERE IT LEADS. WE'VE COME MUCH TOO FAR TO LOSE GROUND ON OUR INDISPENSABLE RIGHT TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT OUR OWN BODIES FREE OF EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT RESTRICTION. TODAY AS WE LOOK BACK AND REFLECT ON ROE VERSUS WADE I URGE YOU TO REMEMBER THE REALITIES OF A WORLD WITHOUT ABORTION RIGHTS. WE MUST NOT FORGET THE COUNTLESS WOMEN WHO RISK AND TOO OFTEN LOST THEIR VERY LIVES IN ORDER TO END UNWANTED PREGNANCIES. LET ME END UP MAKING ONE THING CLEAR CALIFORNIA HAS DOES AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WOMEN. AND OUR FAMILIES AT EVERY TURN NOT JUST ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. FOR MANDATING MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR LIFE SAVING BREAST CANCER SCREENINGTO PROVIDING FUNDING TO SUPPORT BLACK INFANT HEALTH IN THE BUDGET. WE'LL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE POLICIES PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SERVICES. TO INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY OUR KIDS OF ALL KINDS AT ALL STAGES. PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING SR SIXTY THREE. CENTER DRAWS A. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SENATE RESOLUTION SIXTY THREE CALIFORNIA'S LONG STOOD AS THE MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING AND FORTIFYING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION HAS BEEN LEGAL FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY WOMEN FACE TOO MANY BARRIERS TRYING TO ACCESS A SAFE MEDICAL PROCEDURE. FOR LATINOS THESE BARRIERS ARE LAYER IMMIGRANT WOMEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE THEY FEAR AND OFTEN MISTRUST GOVERNMENT PROVIDED CARE. BLACK AND WE'RE- THE NEXT WHICH ARE OFTEN AWAY AND THE PROCEDURES ARE COSTLY ABOUT 60% OF LOW INCOME NON CITIZEN IMMIGRANT WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE LACK HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE THE PROPORTION OF LOW INCOME US BORN WOMEN WE MUST ENSURE THAT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN. FINANCIAL BARRIERS STILL REMAIN THE NUMBER ONE REASON THAT SO MANY ARE UNABLE TO GET TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE THE WAY TO WIN AN HONOR ROLL VERSUS WADE IS FOR REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND TO FIGHT FOR HEALTHCARE EQUALITY AND TO EXPAND ACCESS THANK YOU MANAGER. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE RESOLUTION SIXTY THREE WHICH COMMEMORATES THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE VERSUS WADE AND II M. AS ASTONISHED AS ALL OF YOU TO BE HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO ALMOST FIVE DECADES LATER AND TO SAY THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER THIS LANDMARK UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IS OF ABSOLUTE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. ROVI WAY TO ENSURES AMERICANS A TANAMI OVER THEIR OWN BODIES LET'S FACE IT WOMEN AS THESE REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS HAVE BASS EFFECTS ON THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IF AND WHEN A PERSON CHOOSES TO INCORPORATE A FAMILY INTO THEIR LIFE SHOULD ALWAYS BE THEIR DECISION AND THEIR DECISION ALONE. THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN LEGAL ABORTIONS AND SAFE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE FOR A. FOR STATE. THREE CAN'T SHOULD AN ALREADY MEMBERS IF ROE V. WADE IS EVER OVERTURNED IF ABORTIONS BECOME ILLEGAL BUT PEOPLE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT STOP HAVING OF ABORTIONS MORE WOMEN WILL JUST. WHEN WE DECIDE THAT WOMEN ACTUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS I'M SURE THAT MANY HEREON THIS FLOOR WOODEN AND ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T LIKE US MAKING LAWS THAT TOLD THEM WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH THEIR **** SO I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND I SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO A SAFE. AND LEGAL ABORTION THANK YOU. ENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I ALSO BRYSON STRONG SUPPORT A SENATE RESOLUTION SIXTY THREE TO COMMEMORATE THE FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY. OF THE LANDMARK SUPREME COURT DECISION ROE VERSUS WADE I WANT TO ADD MY VOICE AND I CALLED ALL THE WONDERFUL COMMENTS ALREADY MADE HERE BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY. ROE VERSUS WADE HAS BEEN THE CORNERSTONE. AND THE PROGRESS OF WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY ALMOST FIFTY YEARS WOMEN ACROSS THIS NATION. I HAVE HAD ASSURANCES THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM OVER THEIR BODIES EXIST. AS A NATION WE ARE STILL FAR AWAY FROM TRUE GENDER EQUALITY. YET FOR FORTY NINE YEARS ROE VERSUS WADE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING WOMEN CLOSER TO THAT GOAL AND AS WE KNOW TODAY IT'S BEING CHALLENGED IMPORTANT IN ALLOWING WOMEN TO PLAN THEIR OWN LIVES HAVE BETTER CONTROL. OVER PURSUING PROFESSIONAL CAREERS AND ALIGN WOMEN TO BE GREATER CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS COUNTRY AND IN AND OUT ALLOWING WOMEN TO BETTER PLAN THEIR FAMILIES. AND SUPPORTING CENTER RESERVATION SYSTEM SIXTY THREE WE REQUEST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE FOR WOMEN. LET US NOT GO BACK. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AT THIS R. SIXTY THREE. THIS IS A PHYSICIAN AND ALSO CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND THE- MARKING THIS FORTY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON ROE VERSUS WADE. EVERY PERSON HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY SOMEONE MAY CHOOSE TO DO SO. AND CERTAINLY- AS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT REASONS- WHICH ONE THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO SOME OF WHICH MAY ACTUALLY INVOLVE RISK TO HER OWN LIFE- READ. AS WELL BUT ALSO I MAKE NOTE THAT IS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BERKLEY SAID- THE REASON ISN'T THAT. REASON THIS IS THE WOMAN'S. AND SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY- BE QUESTIONED IN THAT REGARD. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INCLUDING ABORTIONS AND HEALTHCARE. IN FACT IF ROVERS WILL PERSUADE IS OVERTURNED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ASIAN WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE OR RISK LOSING ACCESS. THE CRITICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES SERVICES THAT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES. THAT IS WHY OVER 70% OF ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS SUPPORT ROE VERSUS WADE. THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA AMERICANS HAVE SAID STRONGLY- NUMEROUS POLLS THAT THIS IS A EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RIGHT TO THEM. CERTAINLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN HEALTHCARE WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENSURE EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF GENDER HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR COUNTRY. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONTINUE TO PROTECT THIS RIGHT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECLARED FOR NOW OVER FORTY NINE YEARS. SO I STRICTLY ASKED THAT. WE VOTE FOR YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS R. SIXTY THREE THANK YOU. MEMBERS IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION. EIGHT SAYING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER SCANNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF S. R. SIXTY THREE AND I WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS BY THE PRO TEM UM. I KNOW THAT. WE AS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO PROVIDE ALL THE SUPPORT WE CAN HEALTH CARE SUPPORTS. CHILD CARE FAMILY SUPPORTS. UP REMOVING BARRIERS TO ECONOMIC OBSTACLES- EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE ABLE TO THRIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOW WE'VE NOT YET FULLY ACHIEVE THAT. BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT. A WOMAN WHETHER SHE IS A SINGLE MOTHER OR IN A- PRINT PARTNERED FAMILY THAT SHE HAS THE ABILITY TO RAISE HER CHILDREN WITH SUPPORT. HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT AS MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED I STATED THAT PEOPLE STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE A PREGNANCY AND THAT IS WHAT ROE VERSUS WADE ALLOWED. AND AS WE FACE THIS ONSLAUGHT OF ATTACK ON THE OUR ABILITY TO SEEK THE REPRODUCTIVE CARE THAT WE NEED. A FREEDOM THAT THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS SUPPORT I KNOW ALL THAT CALIFORNIA WILL NOT JUST STAND BY. I AM PROUD THAT WE ARE A STATE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO ABORTION AND ALL REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO MAY SEEK REFUGE HERE. AND WE'RE DETERMINED WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY PERSON'S RIGHT TO BODILY AUTONOMY TO EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO FREEDOM TO CHOOSE FOR WHAT'S BEST FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR HEALTH. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO READ DESCRIBED THE QUALITY FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OF ALL GENDERS WHETHER THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA OR ANOTHER STATE WE WILL NOT GIVE UP THIS FIGHT AND I URGE A YES VOTE ON SR SIXTY THREE.
