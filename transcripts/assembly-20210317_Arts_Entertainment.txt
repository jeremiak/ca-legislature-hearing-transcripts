AN ATHLETE AND IT REALLY DID OPEN UP SO MANY DOORS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME I HAD DREAMS OF THERE BEING A pSCHOOL THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT EVENTUALLY THE W. N. B. A. WAS BORN. AND WE HAVE COME SO FAR IN TERMS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN ATHLETICS AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND THAT PASSED AWAY. I'M EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. ONE THE OTHER THINGS THAT I. THANKS SO CONCERNED. THROUGH THIS HAND IN THE PRIOR TO THIS KIND OF WAS AMONG CHILDREN OBESITY RATES ARE AN ALL TIME HIGH AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMONG LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN A RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT CHILDREN WHO DON'T EXERCISE ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AS CHILDREN WHO DO. AGAIN THIS PANDEMIC HAS ADDED TO THIS ON THE ANXIETY THAT WE SEE IN CHILDREN- THIS GROWING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE NEED TO GET CHILDREN TO BE ACTIVE AGAIN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GREATEST INDICATOR OF POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IS SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS AND COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS HAVE BEEN A BIG ECONOMIC BUT PRINT HAVE A BIG ECONOMIC FOOTPRINT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I AM HOPING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PANELISTS ON HOW THE INDUSTRY'S ADJACENT TO COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS WOULD BE IMPACTED. BY RE OPENING WITH FANS HOTELS RESTAURANTS VENDOR PARKING- SPORTS IS A IS A BIGGER ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT I THINK THAT WE REALIZE. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT. AS WE CAN TO REDUCE. OUR CASE THREE AND ACCESS TO BOX WE NEED TO ALSO BE PROACTIVE IN GREEN LIGHTING ALL LEVELS OF SPORTS AS WELL SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR PANELISTS- AND THE LAST THING THAT I WILL MENTION IS- I SPENT TIME AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT ALL TO THE- AUTISM SPEAKS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

THEY ARE DOLLARS SO HOW MUCH CONTACT ARE VERY COME. THE IT IN THE OR PLAY IS SELECTED A MUCH MEDIA NAY. VALUE YOU KNOW HOW EXPRESS THEY ARE. BUT THEY WERE EXT. TO PLAY WITH THE IN OUR NECK OF WHAT FISCAL OF CONTACTS. TAKE IN A SCORE SPORTS OR SHOULD BE OPEN THERE ARE MANY MANY- PARENTS- KNOCKING ON MY DOOR ON THE SAME TOPIC AND THEN ALSO EVEN ON OUR ON OUR GO AHEAD OF SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS- A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION MEMBERS SO- MEETING. WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS- ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND THAT THAT WAS ALL IN ALL ALL ON ONE OF THOSE SMALL AREAS THAT THAT WE- TALKED ABOUT THE- SO- WITH. THIS OF PERIOD OF. OF VACCINES ALSO AVAILABLE AND- MOST TEACHERS SO ARE ENCOURAGING THE TO GET THE FAXES AND IN PERSON LEARNING AND THE CONTEXT OF- SHOULD BE- VERY SOON OPEN AND- AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE AND ALLOW. ALL THE CONTEXT BOSA FOR THE SCHOOLS SO ARE TO OPEN AND- OUR NON SCHOOL AREA. AND ALLOWING THE PLAYERS TO PLAY AT THE SAME TIME LIMITING EVEN. IF UNPOPULAR- THE CATEGORY OF- DISTRICTS- THE WILL ALLOW LIKE A 20% OFF FOR SPECTATORS YES 20% 50% IF TO SELL INDOOR OUTDOOR AND THEY CAN HAVE A SOCIAL DISTANCING EVEN MORE THAN SIX. YOU KNOW FEET AWAY BUT THAT WILL. FILL UP BOB APPLAUDED YOU KNOW LIKE HALF OF THE STADIUM. ONCE YEAR INSIDE OR OUTDOORS BUT THE WAY THAT THE US NUMBER COME FROM IN VERY LIMITED IN ON NUMBER ABOVE PEOPLE ALLOW THAT THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO ME SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS. HOW TO LEAVE- SAFELY WITH HIS CELL CORBETTA IN PARTICULAR WITH THE VACCINES- NOW BEING INOCULATED SO. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT THE POINT OF AND- I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL FULL OR DISCOURSE OF TO OPEN AND- A SPECTATOR'S OPEN AND- I'VE TO MENTAL- IMPACT. OF CLOSING DOWN EVERYTHING AND EVEN STUDENTS AT HIM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS SO THIS A COMMITTING A SUICIDE AT THAT RATE IS EVEN HIGHER THAN- ARE THE PEOPLE THE YOUNG CHILDREN DYING FROM COLD WITH HIS SELF SO YES I THINK WE NEED TO. OPEN UP A WITH A SAFE GUIDELINES OF THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED THANK YOU DR CHOI AND WITH THAT I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE ON WEB ACCESS AND I KNOW. LISTENING MANDER WEBEX WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU ASSEMBLY WOMAN LAURA FRIEDMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADRIN NAZARIAN IF ANY OF YOU ARE OUT THERE ON OUR WEB BACKS AND WANNA MAKE SOME VERY VERY BRIEF COMMENTS WE WANT TO GET RIGHT BACK ON TRACK OR YOU. CAN MAKE COMMENTS AFTER EACH PANEL. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM WEB ACTS AS A MEMBER. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START RIGHT AWAY OUR- PANEL AND SPEAKER AS I KNOW- SOME OF OUR SPEAKERS ARE IN A VERY SHORT TIME LINE. OUR FIRST PANEL IS GUIDELINES GOVERNING CALIFORNIA SPORTS IN TITLE NINE CONSIDERATION WE HAVE OUR FIRST SPEAKER DR ERICA PAN. WHO IS THE STATE M. A. D. ALL AGES DEPUTY DIRECTOR CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE WELCOME DR ERICA PAN. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH- IN ORDER TO BE WITH YOUR COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON- AS MENTIONED I'M DR ERIC UPON I'M THE STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST- ALSO PEDIATRICIAN BY TRAINING AND I'M ALSO A PARENT- AND I JUST. WANT TO RESONATE THAT I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMER AND PLAYED A WOMEN'S WATER POLO IN COLLEGE AS WELL SO I AM AN ATHLETE AS WELL AND I DO UNDERSTAND- THE IMPORTANCE AN ATHLETE YOU KNOW PULL THE IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISE AND U. SPORTS- TO OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH- I CONTINUE TO TRY TO BALANCE THAT WITH THE- OTHER- IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC- MORE RECENTLY JUST AS FAR AS ATHLETICS- I'VE SORT OF TERMS THAT. THAT PRIOR HISTORY INTO- LEASE AGAIN PRE PANDEMIC WHEN I HAVE TIME- AND MY TRANSLATE- SO JUST TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR OUR YOUTH SPORTS GUIDELINES THAT WE'VE HAD FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH AGAIN WE RECOGNIZE IMPORTANCE ABSOLUTELY OF CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN WORKING TO BALANCE THOSE BENEFITS AGAINST COVE IN NINETEEN RISKS. AS CASE RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE DECLINING ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOW WE ARE ALLOWING OUTDOOR HIGH AND MODERATE SPORTS COMPETITION TO BEGIN WHILE COUNTIES ARE IN THE PURPLE OR RED HERE. WITH MODIFICATIONS AND STEPS TO REDUCE RISK IN COUNTIES WITH THE CASE RATE AT OR BELOW. FOURTEEN CASES PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW VERY NINETY WE HAD REALLY SOME. GUIDANCE FOR AND REC SPORTS AND THAT KIND INTO FOR ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SIX. WE THEN FURTHER UPDATED OUR GUIDANCE ON MARCH FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND OUR GUIDANCE APPLIES TO YOUTH SPORTS IN GRADES K. THROUGH TWELVE AND SCHOOLS COMMUNITY SPONSORED RECREATIONAL CLUBS WORDS ORGANIZE USE WORDS- AND THEN WE ALSO WANTED TO HAVE CONSISTENCY ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES LEVEL OUT LOW MEDIUM AND HIGH RISK CONTACTS WORDS- AND- SO ALSO PUT FOR THE ADULT. RECREATIONAL SPORTS AS PART OF THAT OVERALL GUIDELINES- THESE GUIDELINES DO NOT APPLY TO COLLEGIATE OR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. I DO WANNA MENTION AS WELL JUST AS FAR AS CONTACTS AND THEN THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE- WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO VACCINATION A VERY EXCITING THAT WERE OVER TWELVE MILLION DOSES IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER FOUR MILLION PEOPLE FULLY VACCINATED. WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT THERE IS NOT YET A PEDIATRIC APPROVED VACCINE- WE DO KNOW THAT TWELVE TO SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS ARE BEING ENROLLED IN TRIALS NOW I THINK THAT THAT AGE RANGE TWELVE TO SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS WE MAY HAVE ACCION'S LATER THIS YEAR- BUT- WE ARE JUST NOW. LITERALLY JUST AND REPORTED YESTERDAY THE FIRST TIME THAT KIDS UNDER THAN TWELVE YEARS OLD. THEY'RE GOING TO BEGIN TO DO TRIALS SO WE MAY NOT SEE CHILDREN'S VACCINATED. UNTIL YOU KNOW MUCH MUCH LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IN MINE AS WE THINK ABOUT THE RISKS TO OUR CHILDREN. OF ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK CONTACTS SPORTS THE OTHER THING I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE RARE BUT REALLY IMPORTANT INTEREST CONSEQUENCES OF COVERT NINETEEN WELL AGAIN MANY CHILDREN- YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE SERIOUS IMPACTS ARE CAN HAVE. HAD NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL WE'VE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CONFIRMED MULTI SYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYSTEM AND CHILDREN CASES IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOUR OF THOSE CHILDREN DIED AND OVER HALF OF THEM WERE ADMITTED TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF LONG TERM OUTCOMES- AND SOME OF THE MIDDLE LONG TERM IMPACTS THAT WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PREVENTING WHEREVER WE CAN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE THAT- ALSO TOP OF MIND AS WE THINK ABOUT AGAIN WEIGHING THE DIFFICULT DECISION THE BOUNCES OF SPORTS- AND WHAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO. SAFELY AS FAR AS PHYSICALLY DISTANCE MAKING SURE PEOPLE WEARING FACE COVERINGS ALL THE TIME- LET'S SEE A FEW OTHER COMMENTS- SO. SPORTS THAT ARE. WE AGAIN THEM INTO THE DIFFERENT CAT. AS FAR LOW MEET AND HIGH CONTACT. AND THEN YOU CAN SEE BASED ON WHAT TEARS- WE HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND OUR OUR GUIDANCE IN THE TABLE. AND IT'S AGAIN BASED ON THE LEVEL CONTACT PARTICIPANTS CAN HAVE WITH EACH OTHER. AND ONE OF THE SPORT IS PLAYED INDOORS OR OUTDOORS. HOPEFULLY YOU ALL AREHEARING OUR MESSAGE IS LOUD AND CLEAR THAT ANYTHING OUTDOORS AS MUCH LOWER RISK AND THINGS THAT ARE INDOORS INDOORS IS VERY HIGH RISK- CONDITIONING PRACTICE FOR ALL SPORTS ARE CONSIDERED LOW RISK IF THEY CAN BE OUTSIDE AND- AND- PEOPLE REMAIN DISTANCED- AND AGAIN WEARING A MASK OR FACE COVERING. INCLUDING DURING CONDITIONING IS REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW EARLY ON. PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXERCISE WEARING A MASK I ACTUALLY WEAR A MASK NOW WHEN I RUN AND I DO THINK PEOPLE CAN GET USED TO THAT. SO EXCEPT FOR THINGS LIKE OUR WATER SPORTS AND OTHER PLACES WE REALLY ARE WANTING PEOPLE TO GET IN TO IMPROVE THEIR SAFETY TO BE WEARING FACE COVERINGS DURING- DURING CONDITIONING AND ADD DURING PRACTICE AND COMPETITION UNLESS IT'S A HAZARD- SEE IF THERE'S OTHER. HIGHLIGHTS WANTED TO MAKE SURE SO AS FAR AS HUMAN ERROR COMPETITION JUST TO HIGHLIGHT THE CURRENT GUIDELINES. CANTOR TEAM COMPETITIONS. RESUME IN CALIFORNIA BEGINNING JENNER TWENTY FIFTH AND IT'S BASED ON THE GUIDELINES AGAIN AN ARTISTIC ITEMS. THE STATUS OF RETURN TO COMPETITION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME GIVEN A WHATEVER LEVELS ATTENTION WE HAVE. A NO TOURNAMENTS OR EVENTS THAT INVOLVE MORE THAN TWO TEAMS MAY OCCUR. EXCEPTIONS MAY BE MADE OF AUTHORIZED BY THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IF THERE ARE SPORTS WHERE INDIVIDUAL COMPETITORS FROM MULTIPLE TEAMS ARE ROUTINE- SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT MIGHT BE TRACK OR FIELD. CROSS COUNTRY GOLF- SKIING OR SNOWBOARDING OR TENNIS. AGAIN THINGS WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS COMPETING- YEAH JUST ONE ALSO REITERATE WE STILL HAVE OUR CALIFORNIA TRAVELED WAS REPLACED TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA FOR COMPETITION IS NOT ALLOWED- THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MULTI STATE AND MULTI JURISDICTIONAL OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH. A TURN OF EVENTS OR- OR SPORTING EVENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED OR INDIVIDUALS TRAVELING TO OUT OF STATE COMPETITION SO WE HAD A LOT OF TOPICS RELATED TO THAT- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE TEST REQUIREMENTS AS WELL THAT CAME UP MORE RECENTLY. THE TESTING IS REQUIRED FOR SOME SPORTS AND STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OTHERS. BECAUSE FOOTBALL RUGBY AND WATER POLO ARE HIGH CONTACT SPORTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE PLAYEDON MAST. WITH CLOTHES FACE TO FACE CONTACT EXCEEDING FIFTEEN MINUTES OR JUST VERY CLOSE AND READING HEAVILY IN EACH OTHER'S FACES. WEEKLY TESTING IS REQUIRED FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS AGED THIRTEEN AND OVER. AND COACHES IN COUNTIES WITH THE CASE RATE BETWEEN SEVEN TO FOURTEEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. FOR COMPETITION TEST RESULTS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A PLAY. AND THEN OUTDOOR MATER CONTACT SPORTS SUCH AS BASEBALL CHEERLEADING AND SOFTBALL CAN BE PLAYED IN THESE COUNTIES WITHOUT THE TESTING REQUIREMENT. US MAYBE ALL BECAUSE OF THEIR- AND I'M NOT SURE I'M TAKING QUESTIONS OUR LATER. I THINK I'M DOCTOR PAN AYE I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY ON- NOT ONLY ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HEAR EVERY DAY BUT PIVOTING ONE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ONE AREA AND I'LL JUST JUMP A LITTLE BIT OUT OF ORDER HERE. THAT IS WE'VE BEEN CONTACTED- MORE THAN A FEW TIMES RELATED TO IF YOU WANT TO CALL THEM THE CHARITY RUN GARAGE GROUPS OR GROUPS. THAT MIGHT WHETHER IT'S THE TURKEY TROTTER THIS USING CHROME AND TYPE OF RUNS OR SMALLER FIVE KAYS JUST ALL OF THOSE- IF YOU CAN GIVE US ANY UPDATE THERE OR IF WE COULD HEAR ABOUT ANY PLANS THAT THERE'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN- GUIDELINES THAT. THEIR TAX WORKING FOR THEIR IN. YEAH ANNA THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE- HAVE ALSO BEEN CONTACTED OF COURSE AS WELL AND WE DO HAVE THOSE KIND OF HONOR DR WE'RE WORKING ON SOME GUIDELINES AROUND THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT WHEN THAT COULD BE SAFE- AND HOW THOSE CAN BE DONE SAFELY- SO I THINK IT IS- WE'RE KIND OF DOING A LOT OF THE- MOST RECENTLY UPDATED BLUEPRINTS- AS FAR AS- OTHER THINGS THAT ARE FORTHCOMING SUCH AS OTHER EVENTS AND- SOME OF THE LARGER KIND OF EVENTS- INDOOR SPORTS AND OTHER. PROFESSIONAL SPRTS GUIDELINES AND I THINK SOON AFTER THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING WITH OTHER GUIDELINES ON THOSE KINDS OF EVENTS. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PLANNING AHEAD OF TIME WHERE. THEY NEED A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO. PUT ON AN EVENT. UP WITH THAT I THINK DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE THAT HAS A QUESTION- BECAUSE DOCTOR PAN WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY FOR THE ENTIRE. PROCEEDINGS SO ONE ONE QUESTION FROM OUR- VICE CHAIR. AND IT'LL IT'LL BE QUICK SO DOCTOR PAN DO YOU- BUNCHES A PAID. OR IS THE ADMINISTRATION WORKING ON ANY GUIDANCE- OUTDOOR GREEN TIER WHEN. WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU KNOW 1100% CAPACITY. AND YOU KNOW 1100% PARTICIPATION AND WHAT IS THAT TIMELINE LOOK LIKE. YES WE ARE DEFINITELY ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT- AND HOPING TO HAVE- SOMETHING AROUND THAT THE BILL THE VERY SOON- AGAIN WE'RE FOCUSING ON A LOT OF THESE- MOST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED UPDATE THAT ARE FORTHCOMING- BUT WE HOPE TO HAVE UPDATES ON US FOR THE GREEN PHASE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU DR PAN WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND THAT IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE CAN SEND THOSE INTO HER AND SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STAY AFTER THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVING. OKAY ALL RIGHT NEXT WE HAVE WITH US. THE TWO SPEAKERS ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN AND KIM TURNER FROM THEY ARE BOTH PROJECT DIRECTORS FOR FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS A PROJECT OF LEGAL AID WORK- AND THIS WILL BE RELATED TO TITLE NINE WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH KRISTIN AND I AM A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AND I DIRECT THE GENDER EQUITY AND LGBTQ RIGHTS PROGRAM AT LEGAL AID AT WORK- LEGAL AID AT WORK IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE YEAR OLD NONPROFIT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY KIM TURNER DIRECTOR OF OUR FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS PROJECT I'LL SPEAK FIRST AND THEN WE'LL- WE'LL TRY AGAIN IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR ABOUT EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT THEIR SPORTS BACKGROUND I TO HAVE A STRONG CONNECTION TO SPORTS. I PLAYED BASKETBALL IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND IT WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE ALSO PERSONALLY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND I KNOW WE HOPE EVERYONE HAS A SAFE AND AS WELL AS POSSIBLE DURING THESE REALLY DIFFICULT TIMES- AND I WANT TO THINK AGAIN THE COMMITTEE AT STAFF AND OUR CO PANELISTS FOR THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY. FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES OUR FAIR PLAY PROJECT HAS HELPED GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN OVERCOME GENDER INEQUALITY IN SCHOOL AND PARKS AND RECREATION ATHLETIC PROGRAMMING. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING WITH YOU OUR PERSPECTIVE ON GENDER INEQUALITY IN THE RE OPENING OF YOUTH SPORTS. AND MORE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT PRINCIPLES OF GENDER EQUITY HAVE TO BE KEPT IN MIND AS SPORTS RE OPEN IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE IMPORTANT BOTH BECAUSE GENDER EQUITY IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAWS LIKE TITLE NINE. BUT ALSO BECAUSE GIRLS AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN DENIED EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN SPORTS FOR GENERATIONS SO IT'S BOTH LEGALLY MANDATED. BUT ALSO PART OF OUR CORE SHARED VALUES AS A STATE TO ENSURE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN. AND THROUGH LITIGATION TRAINING AND POLICY WORK FAIR PLAY ADVOCATES FOR GENDER EQUITY IN YOUTH ATHLETICS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE MILLIONS OF GIRLS IN PRE K. ELEMENTARY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BUT ALL TOO OFTEN EXPERIENCED SECOND CLASS SPORTS EXPERIENCES. ARE NO SPORTS OPPORTUNITIES AT ALL COMPARED TO THEIR MALE PEERS. THIS CORROSIVE MESSAGE OF INEQUALITY FOR GIRLS CAUSES LIFELONG HARMS. AND CONVERSELY MAKING SURE THAT GIRLS HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY DEVELOPS GIRLS CONFIDENCE AND AFFORDS THEM A LIFE LONG BENEFITS I KNOW. SOME OF YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE HEALTH BENEFITS FROM PARTICIPATING IN SPORTS. THERE'S ALSO A BETTER EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES IN ADULT EMPLOYMENT SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE GIRLS WHO PLAY SPORTS IN HIGH SCHOOL EARNED 7% HIGHER WAGES LATER IN LIFE. FAIR PLAY SEEMS TO BE ABOUT ACT FOR GIRL. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN LOW INCOME CAN. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WERE GIRLS HAVE THE FEWEST SPORTS OPPORTUNITIES OF ALL THEIR GIVE PEERS. TITLE NINE THE FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN FEDERALLY FUNDED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING SCHOOL SPORTS HAS BEEN A LOT FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS. AND IN CALIFORNIA JENNER EQUITY IN USE COMMUNITY SPORTS RUN OR HOSTED BY YOUR LOCAL PARK AND REC DEPARTMENT. HAS BEENREQUIRED BY AB TWO FOUR FOUR NOTICE THE FAIR PLAN ACT FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS. BEFORE TITLE NINE FEWER THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GIRLS ARE PLAYING HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS NATIONWIDE AND NOW THERE ARE MORE THAN THREE MILLION GIRLS PLAYING HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS. YOUR VOICE STILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA STATISTICS IMPROVE THE PANDEMIC TIMES GATHERED BY THE CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION. MEMBER STATES HIGH SCHOOL CHAU BOYS GETTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY SPORTS COMPARED TO GIRLS DESPITE GIRLS WANTING TO PLAY MORE. AND FURTHER MORE GIRLS TO DO PLAY SPORTS ARE OFTEN RELEGATED TO SUBPAR FACILITIES RESOURCES AND TREATMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN GIRLS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COACHES TRY TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL. THEY ARE TO OPT IN OR RETALIATED AGAINST AND SUCH BACKLASH FOR COMPLAINTS IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER TITLE NINE COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE WELCOMED IN A DRESS. WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE MATTERS DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC. AND FAIR PLAY IS HERE TO HELP. WITH THAT. WE WOULD LIKE TURN TO OUR SPECIFIC CONCERN. AND I'M A GREAT FOR ME ABOUT HOUSE RIPPING CAL. IS GOING FIRST GENERAC WITTY. I PLAYED IN SOME DURING THESE PANDEMIC TIMES ATHLETIC INEQUITY. TUMBY EXACERBATED FOR EXAMPLE GIRLS AND BOYS TEAMS ARE HAVING TO SHARE ALREADY STRAINED AND OVERBOOKED FACILITIES THERE SHARON COACHES THAT ARE MANAGING SEVERAL TEAMS SPORTS IN THE MIDST OF THESE COMPRESS YOU SENSE. THIS FORCED SHARING OF ATHLETICS FACILITIES COACHING AND RESOURCES RAISES THE REAL THREAT THAT ITS GIRLS WILL BE TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS THEY'LL BE PRACTICING AND PLAYING AT THE WORST TIMES GETTING LESS ATTENTION COMPARED TO BOYS SPORTS. AND INFERIOR ACCESS TO THE STRING RESOURCES. GRAYSON THEIR TEAMS HAVE NOT BEEN PRIORITIZED IN REOPENING TO THE SAME EXTENT AS BOYS SPORTS IMMERSING SHORTER SEASONS FOR EXAMPLE. AND JUST GLANCING AT THE LAST YEAR OF NEWS ARTICLES AND COVERAGE AND OUTSIZED LEVEL OF ATTENTION HAS GONE TO BOYS FOOTBALL AND OTHER BOYS SPORTS SUCH AS BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL GETTING BACK TO PLAY. WITH LITTLE TO NO MENTION OF GIRLS SPORTS RESUMING AND THE IMPACT OF THE POTS AND FEMALE TEENS. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT USE ANSIBLE SPORTS ARE ABOUT EDUCATION AND YOUTH% DEVELOPMENT YOUTH ATHLETIC EXPERIENCES SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL REGARDLESS OF GENDER. AND I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN THIS TO CAN TURNER TO CONTINUE REMARKS THANK YOU AND AGAIN I'M JUST SAYING. AGAIN I'M GONNA REMINDER SPEAKERS WE NEED TO KEEP TO THE TIME LIMITS INCREDIBLE COMMENTS. ELIZABETH BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SRE WE STAY ON TRACK. A WELCOME CAN'T. THANK YOU SO MUCH- JUST ONE TO YOU KNOW AS OTHER MENTIONED MENTIONED I AM LIKE LONG AFTER BALI PLAYER. HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL PLAYER PRODUCT OF PARKS AND RACK AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THANK YOU EVERYONE. FOR THIS TIME SAID IN THIS ATTENTION- BUT STILL TURNING OUT TO COMMUNITY YOUTH SPORTS IN TERMS OF OUR UNDER RESOURCE FOR PARKS AND RECREATION AGENCIES WE'RE SEEING THEM STRUGGLING. TO REINTRODUCE YOUTH SPORTS WHILE SERVING AS A SAFETY NET FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES MUCH LIKE THE BELEAGUERED SCHOOLS WE'RE SEEING EXPENSIVE PRIVATE. CLUB SPORTS THAT ARE OFTEN USING PUBLICLY RESTORES JAMS AND FIELDS THEY'RE GETTING BACK TO THEIR WORKOUTS CONDITIONING AND THEIR GAMES BUT THIS IS LEAVING LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND- THEIR KIDS WITHOUT SPORTS OPTIONS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME GIRLS OF COLOR. THESE ARE GAPS WE MUST BILL. WHEN THE SAUDIS AVAILABILITY IS TIGHT AND COMMUNITY SPORTS GIRLS AND BOYS TEAMS AND LEAGUES ALIKE SHOULD GET COMPLETELY EQUITABLE ACCESS AND PRIORITY. IN ADDITION A RECENT SURVEY BY THE ASPEN INSTITUTE'S PROJECT PLAY EMPHASIZE THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN GIRLS AND BOYS SPORTS IN THE PANDEMIC ERA. FOR EXAMPLE BASEBALL PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY BOYS. ON AVERAGE LOST JUST FOUR WEEKS OF ENGAGEMENT DURING KOBE NINETEEN TIMES WHERE'S GIRLS SOFTBALL PARTICIPANTS LAS JUST ACTUALLY SEVEN HOURS EACH WEEK NEARLY DOUBLE THE TIME LOST. THEN FOR OVERALL ATHLETES VIRTUAL TRAINING INCREASED FOR MALES BUT NOT FOR FEMALE ATHLETES IN TERMS OF RITUAL OPPORTUNITIES. WE WOULDN'T ALLOW BOYS TO GAIN ACCESS TO RE OPEN PLAYGROUNDS EARLIER ON THAN GIRLS AS COMMUNITIES OPEN UP. OR TELL BOYS THAT THEY CAN HAVE MORE ENGLISH AND MATH CLASSES AT BETTER TIMES IN THE DAY AS ENCRYPTING SCHOOLING REOPENS. LIKEWISE WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW GENDER INEQUITY IN ANY FORM WHILE WE'RE RE OPENING YOUTH SPORTS. LOOKING AGAIN AT SCHOOL ISSUES AND ONE CAT CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL A PARENT WAS EXCITED TO HEAR HER DAUGHTER SPRING SPORT WAS FINALLY COMING. BACK HOWEVER THE PARENT EXPE WHEN FOR DA IMMEDIATELY FELL TO SOME. BECAUSE FOOTBALL. WAS GIVEN AN EXTRATO BE REACH THEIR DOES- TEAR AND FOOTBALL WAS GIVEN THEIR FIRST CHOICE OF PRACTICE TIMES IN GAME DAYS WITH THE REMAINDER SPLIT BETWEEN MULTIPLE SPORTS. ANOTHER PARENT ADDED I KNOW THAT THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES BUT AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF TITLE NINE I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE EQUITY AND JUST PLAIN FAIRNESS WHEN RE OPENING CALIFORNIA SPORTS. IT ALMOST FEELS AS IF ADMINISTRATOR THERE'S THINK THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THE SCREAMING NATION BECAUSE THESE ARE UNUSUAL TIMES. IN YET ANOTHER CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL A SENIOR GIRL ATHLETE IS STRUGGLING TO GET A COMPRESSED SPRING SEASON FOR HER OUTDOOR SPORT. WARDING WITH ALL ALL THE PRESSURE OF LIFE AS A YOUNG ADULT MY SUPPORT IS MY CALM AND COMFORTABLE PLACE. I SUFFER FROM ADHD AND PLAYING SPORTS HELPS ME KEEP MY WORLD IN ORDER. NOT HAVING THAT RIGHT TO PLAY IS SO DIFFICULT BUT SEEING EVERYONE ELSE HAVE THAT RIGHT AROUND THE IS DEVASTATING. THE GIRLS ONE OF THE COURTS JUST AS MUCH AS BOYS THEY WANT TO BUY FOR THOSE LIFE CHANGING COLLEGE ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS AND THEY NEED THAT ATHLETIC OUTLET OF SPORTS JUST AS MUCH AS BOYS DO. ALL YOU THIRDS PARENTING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF STRESS ANXIETY ISOLATION AND MENTAL HEALTH STRAINS BROUGHT ABOUT BY SHUTTERED SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS WERE ALSO AWARE THAT THE LET THEM PLAY CAMPAIGN AND RELATED LAWSUIT ENDED IN A RECENT COURT ORDER AND SETTLEMENT ALLOWING YOUTH SPORTS TO RESUME IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. AS LONG AS RELEVANT SCHOOL SPORTS FOLLOW THE SAME OR SIMILAR COVERT NINETEEN PROTOCOLS IMPOSED FOR COMPETITION AND PROFESSIONAL OR COLLEGIATE SPORTS WITH BEEN THE COUNTY. FURTHER SETTING STANDARDS ACROSS THE STATE. WE ARE GLAD THAT SPORTS ARE RE OPENING SO LONG AS IT'S DONE SAFELY AND EQUITABLY WE REMIND ALL INVOLVED WE MUST NOT ONLY FOLLOW THE NEW COVENANT AND TEAM PROTOCOLS. BUT ALSO THE LONGSTANDING TITLE NINE PROTOCOLS AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS IMPOSE FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES TO ENSURE A GENDER EQUITABLE REINTRODUCTION OF SPORT. QUICKLY I'LL TURN TO HIGHER EDUCATION OUR COLLEAGUES THAT HELP YOUNG WOMEN COMBAT GENDER INEQUITY AT THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY LEVEL REPORT GENDER INEQUITY IN SPORTS REOPENING. FOR EXAMPLE I WANT CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY. WHEN POTENTIAL COVERED NINETEEN EXPOSURE WAS DETECTED WITHIN THE FOOTBALL THE MEN'S FOOTBALL PROGRAM THE TEAM WAS QUARANTINED PROVIDED HOUSING AND BROUGHT EXPENSE MEALS WHEN POTENTIAL COVERT NINETEEN X. BOOK ORDER WAS DETECTED WITHIN A WOMEN'S TEAM AT THE SAME UNIVERSITY. NO SUCH HOUSING OR MEAL ARRANGEMENT WAS MADE FOR THEM A TROUBLING REFLECTION OF BLATANT UNACCEPTABLE GENDER EQUALITY INEQUALITY AND SPORTS- WOMEN'S ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL HAVE BEEN CUT. OR THREATENED TO BE CUT WITHOUT HEAT FOR WOMEN ALREADY LACKING OPPORTUNITY AND TITLE NINE STANDARDS. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO ENSURE WOMEN ARE GETTING A PROPORTIONAL SHARE ABOUT POLITIC OPPORTUNITIES AND EQUITY IN TREATMENT AND BENEFITS REGARDLESS OF THE PANDEMIC WERE FOR BUDGET STRAINS. FINALLY LET ME JUST SAY TO ENSURE GENDER EQUITY DURING. THE SPORTS RE OPENING PHASES IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO DO THE FOLLOW THINGS. FIRST THERE HAS BEEN NO. OF THE ROCK CHEN EQUITY. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE MUST REMEMBER THAT. LAWS LIKE TITLE NINE FOR SCHOOLS AND AB TWO FOUR FOUR FOR PARKS AND RECREATION ARE STILL 1100% IN AFFECT. ALSO THERE'S NO EXCEPTION OR CARVE OUT FOR FOOTBALL OR OTHER BOYS AND MEN'S SPORTS IN TITLE NINE OR AB TWO FOUR FOUR. SO ALL SPORTS SHOULD BE GETTING BACK TO PLAY ON THE STATE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN TERMS OF SEASON LENGTH. FACILITIES ACCESS PRACTICE AVAILABILITY COACHING EQUIPMENT AND MORE SECOND RE OPENING SHOULD BE A RESET OPPORTUNITY FOR GENDER EQUITY IT'S ESSENTIAL TO TRAIN EVERYONE ON LAWS LIKE TITLE NINE IN AB TWO FOUR FOUR FOUR. FAIR PLAY IRLS IN SPORTS AND OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS HAVE A LOT OF GREAT ONLINE TOOL KITS ON OUR WEBSITE SO THAT COMMUNITIES CAN GET STARTED ASSESSING AND INSTILLING GENDER EQUITY TODAY. AND THEN FINALLY IF THE SCHOOL OUR COMMUNITY LEAGUE ISN'T GENDER EQUITABLE WHEN YOU'RE REAL OPENING YOUR ATHLETICS DEMAND EXPECT PERSIST WITH NECESSARY CHANGE. FOR THOSE IN LEADERSHIP PROACTIVELY EXAMINE AND ADDRESS ISSUES IS WHERE YOUR INSTITUTIONS SCHOOLS PARKS AND REC AND THIRD PARTY LEAGUES ARE BEING GENDER INEQUITABLE FOR KEEPING ANY MEMBERS SUCH AS STUDENTS AND PARENTS IF YOU SEE GENDER INEQUITY IN YOUTH SPORTS IN SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY WEEKS. CONTACT LOCAL LEADERSHIP NOTIFY THE COMPANY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION THE CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC WRITTEN IN FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS YOU CAN HIGHLIGHT AND STAMP OUT SB GENDER INEQUITY IN YOUTH SPORTS THERE ARE MANY EASY. REASONABLE SOLUTIONS TO INSTRUCT US AND LET US TODAY MAKE SURE WE HAVE A TRULY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR GIRLS ONCE AND FOR ALL. THANKS SO MUCH FOR EVERYONE'S TIME AND FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS HEARING WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS NOW. ABOUT THE ISSUES AND WE'RE GRATEFUL. FOR THIS THE SPECIAL HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU CAME TO. AND PLAY GIRLS IN STE. WE CERTAINLY AND I WILL AS A CHAIR I WANT TO INTO RE ENTRY THAT. AS WE LOOK TOWARDS RE OPENING EQUITIES IMPORTANT- AND IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT BUT IT'S A CENTRAL- FOR OUR OUR GIRLS YOUNG GIRLS. TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM AND PLAY AS THEIR MALE PEERS UP WITH THAT THANK YOU THAT WAS OUR FIRST PANEL WE ARE NOW GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL AGAIN EACH SPEAKER WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES OR LESS AND- I REALLY WANT TO HAVE TO CUT ANYBODY OFF SO PLEASE STICK TO YOUR TIME OUR NEXT POINT PANEL IS PLANS FOR SAY FREE OPENING. SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY ATHLETICS- I WOULD JUST ASK IF THERE ARE ANY- INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT ADD REGARDING TO THE FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS AS FAR AS THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT IN EQUITIES THAT WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL BUT OUR FIRST PANELIST WILL BE- THE CHIEF OF STAFF. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ATHLETICS AND THAT WOULD BE BRANDON SOSA. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU TODAY IN ADDITION TO MY POSITION AS CHIEF OF STAFF I'VE ALSO SERVED AS THE CHAIR OF THE USC ATHLETICS KOBE NINETEEN ACTION TEAM A ROLE WHICH I'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING OUR DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSE OF THE PANDEMIC TO PROVIDE A QUICK BACKGROUND ON USC ATHLETICS WERE A MEMBER OF THE PAC TWELVE CONFERENCE AND WE OPERATE TWENTY ONE SPORT-PROGRAMS TWELVE WOMEN'S AND NINE MEN'S. WITH NEARLY SIX HUNDRED STUDENT ATHLETES AND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY COACHES AND STAFF IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY WE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THE FIRST THREE PHASES OF OUR ATHLETICS RESTART AND RETURN TO CAMPUS PLAN WITH THREE MEN'S SPORTS IN THREE WOMEN'S SPORTS THE STUDENT ATHLETE VOICE WAS INCLUDED IN OUR RETURN PROCESS. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY OUR FACULTY ATHLETIC REPRESENTATIVE DR ALAN GREENE A VIRTUAL HOTLINE WAS ESTABLISHED FOR STUDENT ATHLETES TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH SEVERAL STUDENT ATHLETES. INCLUDING MULTIPLE VISITS HOSTED BY PRESIDENT CAROL FULL AND INFORMATION SESSIONS AND WEBINARS WERE HOSTED FOR PARENTS AND STUDENT ATHLETES AMONG OTHER EFFORTS AND SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT OUR ATHLETES ARE VERY EXCITED TO BE COMPETING AGAIN. OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS WERE RIGOROUSLY VETTED FOR EFFICACY AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLIANCE BUYER CAN'T AS MEDICAL TEAM ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY GROUP AND THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL. CENTRAL TO OUR CODE MITIGATION STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN OUR TESTING PROTOCOLS WHICH ARE ALIGNED WITH THE NCAA PAC TWELVE IN UNIVERSITY GUIDELINES PRESENTLY STUDENT ATHLETES IN ALL SPORTS TESTED MINIMUM TWICE WEEKLY THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAM WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY AND OUR STUDENT ATHLETES IN HIGH RISK SPORTS UNDERGO DAILY ANTIGEN TESTING THROUGH A SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE PAC TWELVE CONFERENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR POLICIES. ESSENTIALLY WERE ABLE TO TEST THOSE ATHLETES PRIOR TO THE START OF ACTIVITIES EACH DAY TO INSURE THAT ALL ATHLETES ARE CLEARED TO PARTICIPATE. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND THE SPIRIT OF TRANSPARENCY EVEN AS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION WE TYPICALLY RELEASE ARE CO IN NINETEEN TESTING RESULTS TO THE MEDIA AT EVERY MONDAY. OVERALL I CAN SAY WITH THE UTMOST CERTAINTY THAT OUR COBIT AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY WE'VE HAD THE EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH STATE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AS CALIFORNIA WAS FINALIZING ITS HIGHER EDUCATION GUIDANCE FOR COLLEGE ATHLETICS WE WERE PLEASED TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THE STATE WERE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF LANDET JOSE AND I'M PERSONALLY GRATEFUL AS WELL FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP. LOCALLY WE COLLABORATED WITH L. A. COUNTY WHICH FEATURED JIM CALLS CODE AVOIDANCE PLAN REVIEWS SITE WALK THROUGHS AND VISITS DURING LIVE EVENTS MOST RECENTLY WE WERE PROUD TO SHARE OUR PROTOCOLS AND BEST PRACTICES WITH THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION TO ASSIST WITH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS PLANNING WE'RE THRILLED THAT OUR LEARNINGS AND EXPERIENCES MAY HAVE EVEN BEEN THE SMALLEST BIT HELPFUL WHILE IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO DEFINITIVELY ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SAFER IN A STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT. IF OR INDEED EVER ABLE TO DO SO AT ALL WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW EMERGING THEMES TO OF WHICH I'LL HIGHLIGHT TODAY THE FIRST RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH WHICH HAS BEEN REFERENCE DOCTOR ROBIN SCHOFIELD OVERSEAS ARE SPORTS PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAM WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE LARGEST IN COLLEGE ATHLETICS AND IS GROW BY THREE POSITIONS DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES DR SCHOFIELD SHARED THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF HER ANALYSIS. FOR THE STUDENT ATHLETE NOT BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE AND COMPETE AS EXPERIENCED AS BEING REMOVED FROM A LIFELONG PURPOSE ONLY WORSE TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS HAVE YET TO EXPAND AND DEEPEN THEIR IDENTITIES AND OTHER AREAS OF LIFE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE FORTIFY THEM DURING TROUBLING TIMES MOST ATHLETES DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THEIR LIVES BEFORE SUPPORT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES IN ONE AREA OF LIFE CAN AFFECT MOTIVATION AND OTHER AREAS INCREASES IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AS WELL AS GENERAL REDUCTIONS IN WELL BEING HAVE SPILLED OVER TO AFFECT MOTIVATION IN ACADEMICS IN OTHER AREAS OF FUNCTIONING. THE SECOND TEAM IS IN REGARD TO OUR LEARNINGS ABOUT STUDENT ATHLETE COMPLIANCE WITH CODE PROTOCOLS WHEN THE PAC TWELVE VOTED TO RESUME ATHLETICS ACTIVITIES ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY AFTER PREVIOUSLY PAUSING WE EXPERIENCED. SEVENTEEN DAYS WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE CASES THE LONGEST STRETCH WE'VE HAD WITHOUT ANY POSITIVE CASES AMONG OUR STUDENT ATHLETE POPULATION. SINCE WE BEGAN TESTING REGULARLY IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. TODAY OUR CAMPUS MEDICAL TEAM HAS NOT IDENTIFIED A SINGLE POSITIVE CASE THAT HAS BEEN TRACED ATHLETICS ACTIVITIES. SO WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT IS POSSIBLE SUCH TRANSMISSION HAS OCCURRED. UPON OUR RETURN TO CAMPUS AFTER THE WINTER BREAK WITHIN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS OF THE JANUARY REENTRY PROCESS WE WERE MANAGING SEVENTY ONE STUDENT ATHLETES IN COVERT PROTOCOLS. EITHER FROM A POSITIVE TEST OR FOR THE MOST PART ATHLETES WHO WERE QUARANTINED DUE TO CONTACT TRACING. BY THE FIRST WEEK IN MARCH WITH STUDENT ATHLETES FULLY IMMERSED IN THEIR ACTIVITIES THAT NUMBER HAD BEEN REDUCED TO ZERO. FINALLY I JUST BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK OUR COACHES AND STAFF FOR THEIR SERVICE TO OUR STUDENT ATHLETES. AT USC ATHLETICS WE'VE DEFINED OUR VISION TO BE THE MOST STUDENT ATHLETE CENTER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. AND THAT PURPOSES REALLY MANIFEST ITSELF IN MANY INSPIRING WAYS OVER THE PAST YEAR. AS AN ATHLETICS ADMINISTRATOR I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NOTHING MORE DEVASTATING THAN THE FEELING YOU EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU CAN'T DELIVER FOR YOUR ATHLETES. AND THAT'S BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE OF OUR RELENTLESSNESS IN THE FACE OF SUCH UTTER EXHAUSTION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND A U. S. B. F. X. IS HAPPY TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THIS COMMITTEE. MOVING FORWARD ANYWAY THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BRANDON SOSA FROM USC. WILL GO HEAD AND TAKE OUR PANELISTS AND THEN ALL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. AND NEXT WE HAVE DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS FROM CAL STATE. UNIVERSITY BAKERSFIELD DR KENNETH SINGH FRIED. YES THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME TODAY MY NAME IS- KENNETH ZIGGY SIEGFRIED I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS AT CSU BAKERSFIELD. AND FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT KNOW WHO SHE IS SHE BE PARTICIPATES IN NCAA DIVISION ONE ATHLETICS AS A MEMBER OF THE BIG WEST CONFERENCE- SO WE SPONSOR TEN. FEMALE SPORTS IN SIX MALE SPORTS- THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND THANKS TO MANY- WE HAVE FOUND A LOT OF SUCCESS IN OUR SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AT CSUB. SO TODAY I'LL FOCUS MY COMMENTS AROUND. GENDER EQUITY WHICH I KNOWS BEEN DISCUSSED- IN THE FIRST ANALYST- BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO SUCCESSFULLY. RETURN OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS TO TRAINING AND COMPETITION AND THAT ALSO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST- FOR OUR STUDENT ATHLETES. AND I DO BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ON THE FRONT END FOR EVERYONE WHAT THE ROLE IS OF THE NCAA. THE NCAA HAS FOCUSED ITS ATTENTION TO PROVIDING GUIDANCE SO NOT REQUIREMENTS- AND THEY'VE ALSO PROVIDED LEGISLATIVE RELIEF TO ROLES- BETTER HELP THEIR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS- THOSE STUDENT ATHLETES WHO DO NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE OR THOSE THAT EVEN COMPETED. IN THE FALL AND WINTER GOT AN EXTRA YEAR OF ELIGIBILITY. SO THE NCAA HAS PROVIDED. REQUIREMENTS ONLY AROUND NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS. WHICH IS WHAT THEY MANAGE- SO SORT OF LIKE MARCH MADNESS- THE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY HAVE NOT PROVIDED- MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS AROUND REGULAR SEASON COMPETITION. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE GENDER EQUITY ONE CRITICAL AREA ARE ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL AREAS AROUND THE OPENING IS GENDER EQUITY AND I CAN TELL YOU THE FOCUS OF MY DISSERTATION- RESEARCH WAS AROUND GENDER EQUITY AND FEMALE STUDENT ATHLETES SATISFACTION SO IT'S- DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I AM- PASSION ABOUT AND I'LL- DONE SOME RESEARCH ON- IT WAS PREVIOUSLY STATED BUT I'LL REEMPHASIZE A LOT OF THE ATTENTION SPECIFICALLY MEDIA ATTENTION. HAS FOCUSED ON RE OPENING OF FOOTBALL AND MEN'S BASKETBALL- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO KNOW THAT THE NCAA SPONSORS THIRTY EIGHT OTHER SPORTS WITH. TWENTY ONE OF THOSE BEING FEMALE SPORTS SO I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL FOR LEADERS TO FOCUS ON THE WELL BEING OF ALL STUDENT ATHLETES. NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE OFTEN IN THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT. AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO OVER A FEW BEST PRACTICES THAT I FEEL ARE IMPORTANT ON GENDER EQUITY- ONE IS MAKING SURE WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. THAT THERE'S DIVERSITY IN QUITE SO SIMILAR TO BRANDON AT USC WE HAVE AN ATHLETICS COACH IN NINETEEN ACTION TEAM WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF MEMBERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS. INCLUDING MALE AND FEMALE STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SENIOR WOMAN ADMINISTRATOR- AND MANY OTHERS. I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO WHILE THIS ISN'T THE ONLY PART OF TITLE NINE. I BELIEVE- IT'S CRITICAL THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT PARTICIPATION NUMBERS SO IF THE PARTICIPATION NUMBERS AND AGAIN IT'S A FEDERAL LAW. SHOULD MATCH CLOSELY TO THE OVERALL STUDENT POPULATION FOR INSTANCE AT CSUB WE HAVE 61% OF OUR GENERAL STUDENTS THAT ARE FEMALE. SO WE LOOK TO MIMIC THOSE PARTICIPATION NUMBERS WITH OUR STUDENT ATHLETES YOU TOO ARE COMING BACK TO CAMPUS COMMUNICATION IS CRITICAL AND I KNOW THAT COULD BE EMPHASIZED- OVER AND OVER ADVOCACY WE NEED MORE PEOPLE JUST LIKE WITH THE FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO SPEAK UP TO ADDRESS INEQUITIES WHEN THEY SEE. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO COVER IS- KEY INGREDIENTS TO SUCCESS IN GETTING ATHLETICS PROGRAMS BACK I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL AREAS THEY'RE- SIMILAR TO BRANDON'S EXPERIENCE AT USC. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF CODE NINETEEN CASES WE SAW. HAVE BEEN RELATED TO ALL CAMPUS ACTIVITIES NOT ON CAMPUS ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRACE ANYTHING BACK TO. BOB ATTENTION OR PRACTICES- AND THEN BRIEFLY THE THREE KEY INGREDIENTS- THAT WE HAVE FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL CREATING A BUBBLE IS CLOSE TO ABOUT WAS POSSIBLE. HAVING FRANK CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENT ATHLETES- PUTTING IN ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES- AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT I FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS. OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES TO ALLOW THEM TO RETURN TO COMPETING IN SPORTS I BELIEVE IT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT ATHLETICS PROVIDES GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENT ATHLETES FOR EXPERIENCE ALL LEARNING. SO I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT STUDENT ATHLETES ARE SAFER ON CAMPUS AND OFF CAMPUS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUT THERE TALKING TO THOSE ATHLETES AND HEARING THEIR STORIES. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE A WHO IS THE INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA CAN MEET COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION JENNIFER CARD DOWN. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO- THANK DOCTOR ONE DAY JUST SITTING ON BEHALF OF OUR HUNDRED AND TEN INSTITUTIONS FOR HER RESPONSIVENESS TO OUR MANY REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION CLARIFICATION AND DIRECTION AS IT RELATES TO THE I. H. I. HV GUIDANCE- I SHUDDER TO THINK WHERE WE WOULD BE WITHOUT HER SENSIBILITY OUR INITIAL CONTACT- TOOK ANOTHER JOB AND WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND IT WAS A DEAD SILENCE FOR MONTHS UNTIL SHE PICKED UP THE PHONE. AND CAME TO OUR RESCUE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH DR JOSEPH- WE'RE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE THAN THE FIRST TWO SPEAKERS AND THAT THERE ARE THERE ON CAMPUS- THE THREE C. TWO A. OVERSEAS COMMUNITY COLLEGE ATHLETICS WOULD LIKE I SAID FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN INSTITUTIONS. WE SPONSOR TWENTY FOUR SPORTS TWELVE FOR MEN TWELVE FOR WOMEN. NOW WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE CHAMPIONSHIPS THAT WE OVERSEE. WE PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK- FOR OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS- THAT'S REALLY OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK- TAKE THE INFORMATION FROM THE IT GUIDANCE. EXPLAINED THAT TO THEN WORK WITH THEM- HAVE THEM. OBVIOUSLY KEEP IN TOUCH IMMENSELY WITH THEIR HOUSE THEIR COUNTY AND THEIR DISTRICT. GET THEIR PLANS APPROVED THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO- WE'RE WE'RE COMING I'M COMING OUT DIFFERENTLY THAN- THAN- THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS SO I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE- NCAA AND THE THREE C. TO ACT. AND THE REASON IS THAT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS AS TO WHY WE'RE NOT PLAYING WHY AREN'T WE ARE NOT THERE YET AND WE ARE WE WERE STARTING TO NOT COVER THAT IN A SECOND- BUT THERE'S THERE ARE SOME. FOUNDATIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE C. TWO A. AND THE NCAA AND THEN OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR INSTITUTIONS- I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY THAT THE THREE SEE TO IT IS LIKE THE NCAA. BUT WITHOUT THE MONEY WITH THE STAFF THERE ARE SIX POSITIONS WERE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR FILLED- AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET- THAT THAT THE NCAA DOES TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ON THE LEVEL THAT THEY DO. OUR INSTITUTIONS DIFFER OUR MOST OF OUR NCAA COUNTERPARTS- BECAUSE WE MUST TAKE FROM EXISTING RESOURCES TO PAY FOR ATHLETICS WE DON'T HAVE. LARGE GATES WE DON'T HAVE TELEVISION CONTRACTS. WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE A VERY SMALL STABS THE FEW THAT DO MAYBE HAVE AN ASSISTANT OR ASSOCIATE ATHLETIC DIRECTOR MAYBE ONE OR TWO- THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF LOT OF BODIES GOING AROUND- AND ALSO OUR- WE DON'T HAVE- WE ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH. ENOUGH THAT'S WHY TRAINERS WE HAVE A TRAINER WE JUST TRY WITH HAVING ENOUGH OF THEM AND THE PANDEMIC MADE OF WORSE- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WIND RESPONSE OF. ABOUT AROUND TESTING THE CLAY PRODUCTS AND ALL. IT FALLS ON THEIR SHOULDERS- AND SO. THAT'S THAT'S JUST A PART OF WHAT WE DEAL WITH EVERY DAY IN THE OTHER PART OF THAT JOB. THAT WAS MENTIONED IS NOT POSSIBLE BEHIND. THEIR UNREALISTIC FOR US BECAUSE ONLY TWELVE OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE DORMS- AND SO WE HAVE A VERY. TRANSIENT IF YOU WILL COMMUNITY- BECAUSE WAIT WHERE THEY'RE COMING IN FROM FROM ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND. SO I MENTIONED THE PROCESS WHERE THEY WOULD SPEAK ABOUT THE PROCESS AND BASICALLY THE THREE SEED TO A FORM TO COVER NINETEEN WORKING GROUP JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE GENERALLY IN THE PANDEMIC. AND THIS GROUP HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED TO AND APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS- THE RECOMMENDATIONS RANGE FROM MODIFICATIONS TO PLAYING A PRACTICE SEASONS ELIGIBILITY IN RECRUITING ROLES. AND APPROVING PLANS CREATED BY THOSE ATHLETIC TRAINERS AS IT RELATES TO TESTING STUDENT ATHLETES COACHES STAFF AND OFFICIALS. FROM THE PLANS ARE WHAT WE ARE THE PLANS THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING TODAY ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF THIS GROUP'S WORK AND THIS GROUP CONTINUES TO MEET WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL THINGS ARE BACK TO NORMAL- WE DO HAVE FISCAL CONCERNS- BUT BEFORE I GO THERE. STATUS RIGHT NOW WE ARE FALL SPORTS WE MOVED OUR FALL SPORTS TO THIS FIRST HALF OF THE SPRING OR SPRING SPORTS THE PUSH THEM BACK TO THE SECOND HALF OF THE SPRING. WE HAVE THIRTY TWO INSTITUTIONS AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE TEAMS THAT ABOUT SAID THEY INTEND TO PRACTICE AND COMPETE BETWEEN JANUARY EIGHTEENTH AND APRIL SEVENTEENTH. THAT'S ABOUT- SIXTEEN PER. OF WHAT WE NORMALLY WOULD HAVE. AND THEN FOR THE PRING WE HAVE SIXTY FIVE PROGRAMS AND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR SO FAR- THEY'RE OUT THEY'RE ABLE TO EITHER CHANGE THE CHANGE THEY'RE ABLE TO CHANGE HER MIND OPT IN OPT OUT- BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES- AND THAT'S- ABOUT 60% OF OUR TEAMS. AND ROUGHLY GENERAC WE WISE IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SAME AS WHAT WE NORMALLY HAVE- SO THAT. MEN AND WOMEN WERE PROGRAMS- IN SO THEY CAN- PRACTICE INTERVIEW BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH AND JUNE TWENTY THIRD. THEY ARE ONLY ABLE TO DO 70% OF THEIR SEASON- SO. A FORTY GAME BASEBALL SEASON WOULD BE REDUCED 270% AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO- WORSE AT THE HANDS. FORTY GAMES SOFTBALL SEASON FOR THAT MATTER I DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TOO MANY TO HIT THAT NUMBER BECAUSE- OF THE COST OF TESTING INCLUDING. PROTOCOLS COUNTY OR DISTRICT RESTRICTIONS ON OPPONENTS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF EITHER FACULTY CONTRACT ISSUES IN THE GENERAL LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF COMPETITION- AND IT KIND OF TIES INTO THE COSTS. OF THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH- THE COST OF TESTING IS A MAX AS WELL AS THE ENHANCED. PROTOCOLS TO TRAVEL THE EXTRA STAFFING- IN ORDER FOR OUR ATHLETIC. OPPORTUNITIES ARE TIED TO CLASS SARKAAL. ARE CONCERNED WITH OPENING. THEIR COLLEGES TO PROVIDE. RESOURCES TO THEIR STUDENTS. THERE ARE OUT THERE ALSO- CONCENTRATING UP OPENING UP CLASSES DELIVERING THOSE CLASSES HOPEFULLY BACK- IN PERSON AT SOME POINT. AND SO I THOUGHT EXES IS JUST. PART OF THAT EQUATION IS NOT SEPARATE FROM THE AND FINALLY THE THREE C. TO A BELIEVES THAT DUE TO THE ROLLOUT OF VACCINATIONS IN COMBAT COMMON NINETEEN NUMBERS GOING DOWN. THE TIME IS RIGHT TO LOOK AT REVISIONS TO THE ICICI GUIDANCE THAT WILL ALLOW THREE C. TOO MANY INSTITUTIONS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE STUDENT ATHLETES WE SERVE THE CHANCE TO GET BACK ON THE FIELD COURT AND TRACK IN THE FALL. ATHLETICS'S INTERCULTURAL ENROLLMENT AND COMPLETION OF OUR FOR OUR POPULATION WHICH IS MORE THAN 70% OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES ARE FROM DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED GROUPS. WE HAVE LOST DO NOT PLEASE DO THE ABSENCE OF ATHLETIC PRACTICING COMPETITION SIMPLY PUT ATHLETICS IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SOME DISMAL OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE HEARING AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO GET PEOPLE BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SOME OF IT WILL BE RECTIFIED BY THEM ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN SPORTS ALL RIGHT AT THE FINISH OFF THIS PANEL WE HAVE RHONDA'S SAID THE WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION- WELCOME RON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA AND I BELIEVE YOUR HOST WAS GOING TO GIVE ME THE ABILITY TO SHARE MY SCREEN- BECAUSE I DID WANT TO SHOW YOU A FEW- THERE WE GO. YEAH PERFECT. OKAY SO THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE PPORTUNITY TO- TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY AND- TO DISCUSS THE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND THE RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AS MANY OF THE PANELISTS OF MENTIONED- WE ALL HAVE INVOLVEMENT EITHER WITH SELF FOR FAMILY- ALSO I'LL CHOOSE TO FOCUS MALES IN MY FAMILY MY WIFE WAS A COLLEGIATE ATHLETE I HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS- TO HAVE PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS INDIVIDUAL IN COLLEGE SPORTS AND I AM A CURRENT HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR WATER POLO PLAYER AND SWIMMER WHO IS VERY EXCITED TO BE BACK IN THE POOL AND- SHE'S OFF TO PLAY COLLEGE WATER POLO NEXT YEAR AND THEN I HAVE A SON WHO'S A HIGH SCHOOL A- STUDENT ATHLETE AND FRESHMAN. ALL OF US IN THE STATE OFFICE- I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND RETURN TO MANY OF US AS I MENTIONED HAVE CURRENT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ATHLETES THAT ARE LOOKING TO GET BACK TO PARTICIPATE QUICK OVERVIEW THE CIF AS YOU KNOW WHERE THE GOVERNING BODY OF HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS WE HAVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED FIVE MEMBER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE WITH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENT ATHLETES OVER IN OUR THOUSAND STUDENT ATHLETES AND WE'RE IN FEDERATION MODEL WITH TEN SEMI AUTONOMOUS GEOGRAPHIC SECTIONS AND OUR STATE OFFICE LOCATED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. PUTTING THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THE NCAA ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY DIVISION ONE TO BE HAS ELEVEN OTHER MEMBER INSTITUTIONS AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENT ATHLETES SO GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE. OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD OF. WE DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND- DOCTOR UPON WHO WAS ON EARLIER HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THAT WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE. OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. ALONG THE WAY WE MADE MANY ADJUSTMENTS- WE'VE ADJUSTED OUR CALENDARS- WE DELAYED THE BEGINNING OF OUR SPORTS TO DECEMBER AND THEN HAD TO FURTHER PUSH IT BACK. BECAUSE I WANTED OUR SCHOOLS GOAL TO FOCUS FIRST ON HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TURN THEIR STUDENTS TO LEARNING AND ACADEMICS. AND THE TIME NEEDED TO DO THAT AND IMPROVE THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING WHICH WHICH THEY'VE OBVIOUSLY DONE. WE ALSO MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS. SO THAT WE PUT ASIDE A LOT OF OUR FANS OUR CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST SEASON. TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGULAR SEASON FOR OUR STUDENT ATHLETES AND OUR MEMBER SCHOOLS. WE'RE HOPING THAT WE COULD MAYBE HAVE SOME SPRING CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS. IF THE TRAVEL. RESTRICTIONS ARE AT LEAST RELAX A LITTLEBIT TO ALLOW STATEWIDE TRAVEL IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE MANY OF OUR SPRING STUDENT ATHLETES MISTER STATE FACT ALL OF OUR SPRING SARGSYAN ATHLETES. MISTER CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS LAST SEASON. WE ALSO ISSUED A LETTER TO OUR MEMBER SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR MEMBER SCHOOLS UNDERSTOOD THE CIS EXPECTATION WITH RESPECTED HEARING. TO THE GUIDANCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THAT IS MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION- YOU AGREE OH FIVE OUR RULES AND OUR DECISIONS AND ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS WAS. TO ABIDE BY ALL THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS BEING PUT OUT THERE BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR ADMINISTRATORS FOR HOW THEY HANDLE THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY WATCHED A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE C. I HAVE. CONTINUE TO PLAY IN AND MAYBE NEVER EVEN STOPPED. AND THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LINE AND UNTIL WE'RE ALLOWED TO BEGIN MOST RECENTLY- WE STILL ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF ISSUES REGARDING U. SPORTS IN IG GUIDANCE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW OUR- OUR INDOOR SPORTS ARE NOW UNDER THE IG GUIDES THEY WANT TO START WITH VERY DIFFERENT TESTING PROTOCOLS. AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO DISCOVER HOW TO. TO MAXIMIZE THE RETURN. TO PLAY FOR AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE VERY LUCKY CAL. ALL TO HAVE A SPORTS MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SOME OF THE BEST SPORTS MEDICINE PHYSICIANS ETCETERA AND- NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE WORLD- BECAUSE OF WHERE WE'RE LOCATED AND THEY'VE HELPED US DEVELOP MANY OF THE FOLLOWING RESOURCES- RETURN TO PLAY ACTIVITIES AND TRAINING. SO THAT STUDENTS THAT HAVEN'T PLAYED IN AWHILE ARE PUT BACK OUT THERE IN THE SAFEST MANNER POSSIBLE. WE'VE ALSO ISSUED TO RECENT DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE ABUSED OR ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND ALSO TO PHYSICIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR WHEN THEY BELIEVE STUDENT ATHLETES NEED TO BE TESTED FOR CARDIAC EVALUATED AND- CARDIAC TESTING. AFTER A POSITIVE C TEST CASE. AND THEN ALSO GRADUATED RETURN TO PLAY WAS ADDED TO OUR WEBSITE AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR OUR SCHOOLS. DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CASE I SAW A SYMPTOMATIC TO SEVERE. AND HOW TO BRING STUDENTS BACK AFTER THE INITIAL TEN DAY QUARANTINE PERIOD- AND BRING IT BACK SLOWLY WITH RESPECT TO EXERCISE. OUR NATIONAL FEDERATION- WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE OUR IN CA- IS ISSUED A CAR SITS FREE FOR COACHES AND ADMINISTRATORS. WITH RESPECT TO COPE IN NINETEEN. WE ALSO INSTITUTED AND THIS GOES TO SPEAK TO- WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER WITH THAT WITH THE FAIR PLAY- FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP WITH THAT ORGANIZATION IS SPECIFICALLY WITH WITH KIM TURNER- THEY HAVE CALLED ISSUES TO OUR ATTENTION BOTH IN PRIOR YEARS IN THIS YEAR AND IT'S ALLOWED US TO ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY OCCUR. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A FAIR AND EQUITABLE RETURN TO PLAYING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOAL FOR ALL OF US. OR SEE I HAVE LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE. THE GOAL IS TO DEVELOP FUTURE LEADERS A CIF AND ONE OF OUR FIRST PROJECTS THAT WE HAD TO WORK ON WAS. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUES OF EQUITY WITH RESPECT TO GENDER RACE AND ACCESS WHICH WE'RE SEEING EXACERBATED THIS YEAR. SO THESE ARE THE INFORMATION EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE AS LINKS AND RESOURCES FOR HOW TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS AND SPORTS. NOT JUST FOR PLAYING SPORTS BUT ALSO A FUTURE IN SPORTS OUR BELIEF IS THAT. THE MORE A FEMALE STUDENT ATHLETES. SEAT WOMEN OUT THERE THAT ARE COACHING BETTER TEACHING THAT ARE INVOLVED IN SPORTS THEY'RE PLAYING SPORTS OF THE KWIDZYN PROFESSIONAL LEVELS. BUT THOSE CAN BE THEIR ROLE MODELS SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES HERE THAT WE DEVELOPED. TO ASSIST IN THAT RESPECT AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AS YOU HEARD NEXT YEAR'S A FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE NINE. AND WE INTEND TO MAKE THAT A MAJOR FOCUS OF OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF RACE ON OUR CAMPUSES AND HELP PROVIDE STRATEGIES FOR COACHES AND ATHLETIC ATHLETIC ADMINISTRATORS INSIDE ADMINISTRATORS TO HELP INTERRUPTING PRINT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES. AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO DO SO WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE BEING A RESOURCE FOR OUR MEMBER SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ACCESS IN THIS IS BEEN A MAJOR CONCERN OF OURS. IN THE RETURN TO PLAY. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE ONLY THE SCHOOLS THAT CAN AFFORD TO RETURN TO PLAY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CAN AFFORD TO RETURN TO PLAY TO DO SO. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S APPROPRIATE TESTING RESOURCES FOR EVERYONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO COME BACK. TO THE FIELD TO PLAY THE POOLS THE JAMS ETCETERA. AND DO IT IN A SAFE. SAFE MANNER AS POSSIBLE AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THERE'S IS A LOT OF STUDENT ATHLETES THAT WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON CLUB SPORTS. BUT MANY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT AND HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS. IS ONE OF THE FEW AND MAYBE THE ONLY FREE RESOURCE LEFT FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ATHLETICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR IT WHEN WE RETURN. SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR IMPORTANT WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU RON NECESSITY- A SHORTER WAY TO SAY IT IS C. I. F. EVERYBODY. KNOWS WHAT THAT IS WHO'VE PLAYED A- HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS AND- I MYSELF- JUST GAIN SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE- WORKSHOPS YOU'RE HOSTING AND- OTHERS. ARE NOW IS THE TIME FOR US IF ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTION WHETHER YOUR ON WEB ACCESS. OR HERE IN PERSON. FOR OUR PANELIST. OKAY WE HAVE ONE FROM OUR VICE CHAIR. OKAY I'M JUST CURIOUS IF ANYBODY ON THE PANEL KNOWS ARE THERE OTHER STATES OPEN FOR SECONDARY AND POST SECONDARY SPORTS AND WHAT GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE SO AND- ALSO IN REGARDS TO TESTING DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY AND RESOURCES- TO TEST. CAN YOU SAY THAT LAST PART YES BECAUSE I IDEA DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY AND RESOURCES FOR TESTING BY. ALL RIGHT THAT WAS FROM ANYBODY ON THE PANEL NOW HOW DO WE DO THIS VIRTUALLY IF WE'RE ASKING THE PANEL. THINK ABOUT EACH OTHER YES WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND ASK. STILL BE ON. ABSOLUTELY AND- SO WITH RESPECT TO TESTING WE DO BELIEVE THAT OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR TESTING- FOR THE OUTDOOR SPORTS- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO BEING ASSISTED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THROUGH THEIR VALENCIA LABS AND BECAUSE THE OUTDOOR SPORTS THE TESTING IS ONE DAY PER WEEK I DO THINK OUR SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THATWE HAVE A MUCH GREATER CONCERN AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR GUIDANCE FOR INDOOR SPORTS THAT ARE UNDER THE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GUIDANCE WERE TESTING HAS TO BE ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS- THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN LIES. WE WOULD WE WOULD ADVOCATE THAT BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THE STUDENT ATHLETES AND THE TESTING IN THE EASE OF TESTING FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT FOR OUTDOOR IN ORDER SPORTS IT WAS THE SAME CADENCE OF TESTING OF ONE DAY A WEEK- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN EQUITABLE RETURN. AND AS DOCTOR CAN- SIX. ON STILL LIKE TO MAYBE NO VISIT IS OPINION TO THE QUEST. FOR SECONDARY YES. I'M ON. SO- YEAH. THE WANT ME TO REPEAT THAT ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE OTHERS OPEN FOR- SPORTS GARLING HAVE BEEN IN AN EGG AND THE QUESTION FOR YOU ALSO AROUND TEN DO HAVE THE AND RESOURCES. YEAH SO ALSO. FIRST- I BELIEVE. THERE IS A- VARIETY. OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES. ON SCHOOL SO I CAN'T I CAN SAY FOR US. WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TESTING THERE'S A LOT OF- RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO HELP US. SPARSE OTHER STATES. PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT IS- CALIFORNIA IS BY FAR THE MOST RESTRICTIVE- WHETHER PEOPLE THINK THAT'S GOOD OR BAD. IT'S THE MOST RESTRICTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO- OPENING UP FOR SPORTS- AND- REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO CONTACT TRACING. TESTING AND THEN BACKS NATIONS AS FAR AS THE AREAS THAT. HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL FOR OPENING UP- OTHER STATES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. OKAY ONE OF THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE CAN- AND THIS QUESTION- ALSO MENTORING IF YOU'RE CAN- EXPLAINED TO ME- ARE THE IMPACT OF THE STATE'S SUPPLIED LINES. I'VE HAD A ON THOSE CHILDREN AFTER LEASE. WHERE THERE COUNTERPARTS IN ORDER CITIES. HAVE A UP- QUICKER THAN A WAR OWN. ARE WE GO BACK TO DOCTOR KENNETH A SIXTEEN SINCE HE'S ON THERE- THAT'S PROBABLY MORE OF AN OPINION IN A QUICK ANSWER BUT GO AHEAD AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF OUR ATHLETES COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. STILL MY VIEW ON THAT IS. OUR STATE GUIDANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL. BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION EVEN NATIONALLY THAT THE NCAA IS SETTING THE ROLE ALL THE COLLEGES. AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE IT'S WE TAKE OUR STATE GUIDANCE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- SO I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA'S. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE. IN OTHER WORDS. OUR STAYED WITH SO MUCH STRICTER AND- OR SOUL- STAY. LOS OLE. SO ON. WAS THERE ANY NAY IN UPON OUR ATHLETES. YEAH THE I HAVE BEEN LIMITED SO WHEN IT COMES TO EXPERIENCE CHILLED LEARNING WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING I BELIEVE WE MAY BE- BEEN HELD BACK A LITTLE BIT OF THOSE AREAS. BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT- OPENING UP TOO SOON A FEW MONTHS AGO COULD HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THAT'S A WHOLE THERE THAT'S A WHOLE TINY QUESTION AND ANSWER- HELLO FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES. ARE PLAYED YOU SPORTS BEFORE CALIFORNIA SO MAYBE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO BUT THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS THAT EVEN GO BACK SIX MONTHS ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND THANK YOU. CAN I HAVE A- QUESTION IS. WE'RE GONNA GO HEAD MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL BECAUSE WERE A FIFTEEN MINUTES LATE BUT WE WILL YOU WILL BE BACK TO. THE OTHERS TO SPEAK. SO WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND MOVED OUR NEXT PANEL. WHICH IS PROFESSIONAL SPORTS OUTLOOK LESSONS LEARNED IN PLANS FOR COVE IN NINETEEN. WE HAVE THREE SPEAKERS WANT TO REMIND YOU YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES EACH. AND AGAIN THIS IS NOW GOING ON TO OUR PROFESSIONAL. FIGHTERS MARC MARTIAL ARTS HEAVY WEIGHT AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE TOP SPEAKERS HERE FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO FIRST WE'RE GONNA INVITE MMHM. MIKE NEWQUIST WHO IS THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP. WELCOME MIKE. THANK YOU IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY. SO MY NAME IS MIKE NEW QUEST WHEN I SERVED AS THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF EVENT ABOUT WOMEN FOR THE UFC THE WORLD'S PREMIER MIXED MARTIAL ARTS ORGANIZATION. AMONG MY RESPONSIBILITIES I OVERSEE ABOUT MARKETING TICKETING HOSPITALITY AND TRAVEL OPERATIONS. AND SINCE LAST YEAR I'VE OVERSEEN YOUR CITY'S COPA NINETEEN TESTING PROGRAM. UFC IS TRULY A GLOBAL BRAND WE HAVE MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION FANS WORLDWIDE AND ARPENTS ARE BROADCAST TO OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION HOMES IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES. IN FORTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. THROUGHOUT OUR COMPANY'S HISTORY WE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BRINGING UFC EVENTS TO CALIFORNIA TWENTY NINE TIMES. MORE CITIES SUCH AS ANAHEIM LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO HAVE GRACIOUSLY HOSTED US. THE LOGISTICS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND AMONG THE MOST UNIQUE IN ALL OF SPORTS. AS UFC PRODUCES EVENTS NEARLY EVERY WEEK TRAVELS TO DIFFERENT CITIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND HAS NO OFF SEASON. THIS TIME LAST YEAR AS THE WORLD WAS SHUTTING DOWN AND IT'S HUNDREDS OF SPORTS EVENTS WERE CANCELED. UFC COULD HAVE SUSPENDED OPERATIONS INDEFINITELY LIKE OTHER SPORTS DID. NO DOUBT THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO STAFF LAYOFFS AND PAY CUTS. HOWEVER OUR PRESIDENT DANA WHITE TESTERS TO FIND A WAY TO PRODUCE UFC EVENTS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ATHLETES AND STAFF. SO WE CAN KEEP OUR BUSINESS STRONG AND OUR STAFF EMPLOYED. DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR SPORT HEALTH AND SAFETY HAS LONG BEEN A PRIORITY FOR YOUR SEATS. AND WE HAVE SET THE STANDARDS FOR INDUSTRY. HOWEVER WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT FURTHER ENHANCE SAFETY MEASURES IN ORDER TO RETURN TO PRODUCING LIVE EVENTS. THAT'S THE FIRST STEP. WE DRAFTED A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY OPERATIONS PLAN IN CONSULTATION WITH TOP MEDICAL EXPERTS GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT WAS FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON COBRA NINETEEN MEDICATION. THIS THIRTY PAGE DOCUMENT OUTLINED A VARIETY OF PREVENTATIVE MEASURES INCLUDING COVER NINETEEN TESTING TEMPERATURE SCREENING SOCIAL DISTANCING YOURSELF PP CLEANING AND SANITATION PLANS MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND MUCH MORE. ONCE WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR PLAN WE SOUGHT TO RETURN TO PRODUCING LIVE EVENTS AFTER A BRIEF HIATUS AS A RESULT I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE C. WAS THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES TO COME BACK IN THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN ERA. WHEN WE PRODUCE THREE SUCCESSFUL EVENTS IN JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA LAST MAY. THESE EVENTS WERE FULLY SANCTIONED BY THE FLORIDA STATE BOXING COMMISSION AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR MEDICAL STAFF AND STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA AND MAYOR OF JACKSONVILLE TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS WERE IN PLACE. THESE EVENTS WERE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AND PRODUCED WITH ONLY ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL IN ATTENDANCE. FOLLOWING JACKSONVILLE WE RETURN TO OUR HOME CITY OF LAS VEGAS FOR A SERIES OF EVENTS AND- UFC PREPARATION WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE NEVADA STATE ATHLETIC COMMISSION UNDER GUIDELINES FROM NEVADA'S GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO FURTHER REFINE OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PLAN. INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING A BUBBLE LIKE ENVIRONMENT STRICTER QUARANTINE PROTOCOLS IN LIMITING THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL IN OUR FACILITY. THE NEXT SERIES OF EVENTS TOOK US TO ABU DHABI WHAT HAS BEEN FAMOUSLY GRANTED UFC FIGHT ISLAND. AS WITH OUR EVENTS IN JACKSONVILLE IN LAS VEGAS WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ABU DHABI AUTHORITIES TO FINE TUNE OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PLAN TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL COVERT SAFETY TO COVER TESTING. AND THE SAFETY ZONE THAT WAS ONLY OPEN TO U. S. UFC ATHLETES STAFF. AND ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL. DESPITE THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES OF TRANSPORTING NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED UFC STAFF AND ATHLETES TO ABU DHABI. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MINIMIZING THE RISKS OF COCA NINETEEN WHITE ISLAND WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THERE WERE ZERO POSITIVE CODE NINETEEN CASES AMONG THE UFC DELEGATION IN ABU DHABI. AND ALL PERSONNEL RETURN HOME SAFELY AFTERWARDS. THESE EARLY EVENTS IN JACKSONVILLE LAS VEGAS AND ABU DHABI ESTABLISHED THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ROAD MAP WE CONTINUE TO USE TO HELP US PRODUCE EVENTS SAFELY RESPONSIBLY AND SUCCESSFULLY WELL WE MANAGED THE CHALLENGES OF COPING NINETEEN. SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. USC HAS PRODUCED FIFTY EVENTS AND WE HAVE ADMINISTERED MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND COVER TASK TO STAFF AND ATHLETES YIELDING A POSITIVITY RATE OF ONLY ZERO POINT 86% ZERO POINT EIGHT SIX PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THIS TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST POSITIVITY RATE AMONG PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. IN SUMMARY WE CAN HOLD EVENTS SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY WHILE MINIMIZING THE RISKS OF COVERNINETEEN THIS WAS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SUPPORT OF TOP MEDICAL EXPERTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND HEALTH OFFICIALS AS WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY PLAN. THE CONFORM TO JURISDICTIONAL GUIDELINES LIKE THE VENTS ARE THE DNA OF UFC AND ATTENDING IN PERSON IS THE MOST IMPACTFUL EXCITING WAY FANS CAN EXPERIENCE THE SPORT. OUR RESEARCH INDICATES THERE NEARLY SIX MILLION UFC FANS IN CALIFORNIA WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT BODIES SUCH AS THIS DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH A PATH TO BRING UFC EVENTS BACK TO THIS GREAT STATE. STATE IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE WAY AND TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE FANS TO EXPERIENCE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE MOST THRILLING. SPECTACLE IN ALL SPORTS I THANK YOU FOR THEIR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AFTER THIS PANEL. THANK YOU MIKE THE NEW.

AND CREATE A CITY OF TOP SEED WE HAVE REGULAR CAST WE HAVE- THE MAN THE GLOVE BURST EFFECTIVE WITH MY- THE DECISION. EVERY THAT YOU KNOW THE BULB IS NOT- WE YOU IN LOOKED AT A LOT OF THE- SIX IS THE U. S. HAD JACKSON. AND ALSO LOOK AT SOME OKAY WILL MAKE WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN DO THIS WE LEARN FROM THAT EXPERIENCE AND SO WHAT WE DEVELOP A PRETTY GOOD A SERIES OF REGULATE- WE'VE HAD A- VERY VERY LOW POLICY. RIGHT WE WE'VE BEEN- NOT AS AS U. S. OF COURSE WE'VE HAD ABOUT WE CAN TWENTY FIVE OF THE- VETERAN THOUSAND TEN. WE NOT HAD THAT MANY PAUL A THIRD POSITIVE. WHAT HAPPENS- MEMBERS. A LOT OF TIME BEFORE BERMAN WITH. A PUT A NATIONALLY OR CAMP ON THE CARD GO AWAY AND- CHECK THEM BEFORE THEY BEFORE WE SEE THEM WHEN TESTS THAT CAN. MAY SURE THE THERE. THAT THEY'RE GOOD SO- THAT'S WHAT THAT ABOUT- MOVING FULL. MOVE FORWARD WE CAN GOING TO CAN YOU THE SAY. RECKONED TO USE THE BUBBLE. WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT TESTING WE LEARNED A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TESTING AND WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO USE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TEST AND- BUT IT'S BEEN A REAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE NOT THINK WE BE INVOLVED- KNOWLEDGE AS WE WENT ALONG. AND PERHAPS WE'VE BEEN OVERLY CAUTIOUS AT TIMES BUT I WOULD RATHER BE OVERLY CAUTIOUS TO NOT CAUTIOUS ENOUGH IN THIS SITUATION- THIS IS A PICTURE I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU JUST SOME EXPERIENCE SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES IN THE BUBBLE WHEN I WENT THERE- THE FOOD IS ALL PACKAGED SEPARATELY SO THAT THE ATHLETES AND- AND THE STAFF HAVE TO GET IT SEPARATELY THE TABLES ARE ALL PUT TOGETHER YOU HAVE TO CALL TO GET ON THE ELEVATOR TO RIDE ANYWHERE YOU HAVE BRACELET OWN.

AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT COMING BACK AND- THAT WILL RETURN. WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED IN SOMEONE'S ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BEEN BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES AND- ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS AND- HAD HAD AN ISSUE WITH IT AND SO WHAT WE DID- SHE SHE BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AND WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH CONSUMER AFFAIRS PUBLIC. AFFAIRS UNIT. AND WE- ASK SOME OF OUR CHAMPIONS AND LYFT VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND WE MADE A NAS MIDDLE HELP VIDEO- AND WE'VE PUT IT OUT. ON SOCIAL MEDIA- SO WITH THAT SAID MADAM CHAIR I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL. THANK YOU I- REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT YOU MADE I THINK THAT ATHLETE TO ATHLETE THAT TYPE OF- MESSAGE COULD BE VERY INSTRUMENTAL FOR ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNGER ATHLETES WHO ARE REALLY- NAVIGATING THIS FOR MANY OF THEM ON THEIR OWN- AND A ON THE LAST PANELISTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PANEL IS MIKE. MCATEE WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF U. S. BOXING MIKE. AFTERNOON- SHARE- IS WORK SHAUNA- IN DURING PANEL MEMBERS- MY NAME IS MIKE NINETY I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF USA BOXING A USA BOXING IS ONE OF FIFTY NATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES CERTIFIED BY- THE UNITED STATES OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE I'M HERE IN COLORADO SPRINGS COLORADO ONE BIG CITY USA FONG AND ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS- ARE PRETTY COMMON NUMBERS OF FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS- THIS YEAR WE'RE DOWN. TO SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REPRESENT OUR SCHOOL WORK AND OTHER USE OR NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY SPORTS. THAT IMPACT- ALL ARE- DIFFERENT NATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES FROM USA BOXING TO DIFFERENT COMBAT SPORTS WITHIN THE ANTI BEES AND THEN ALSO- REGULAR SPORTS- FAQIH HI CUANDO ATTRACTED BILL. AND IF IT WOULD BE OKAY THE HOMICIDE LIKE TO SHARE. MY SCREEN I HAVE A SMALL- OUR POINT THAT I CAN ADD TO IT. YES. I CAN BE THERE WE GO. WE COULD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE THAT- NOT IS FC IS A CAMINO YES THERE IT IS THERE IT IS YES. THANK YOU- I JUST WANTED HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE'RE AT IN USA BOXING I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE A FEW THINGS CURRENTLY- WE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN MARCH WE SHUT DOWN- AND- THEN AS WE NOTICED IN DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY APPROXIMATELY ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND- WE WERE SHUT DOWN BY MAY TWENTY SECOND. WE HAD OF SOME FORM OF BOXING- ACROSS THE COUNTRY KNOWING THAT BOXING WOULD OCCUR- UP MARGINS WE CAME OUT WITH OUR BACK TO BOXING PROTOCOLS IN JUST A NATIONALLY STARTED WITH OUR- GUIDELINES FOR DIFFERENT BOXING GYMS WHAT DID HAPPEN WAS- AS WE WERE ABLE TO GO BACK TO BOXING ON JULY ELEVENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE HAD OUR FIRST BOXING COMPETITIONS ONE BEING IN NEBRASKA ONE BEING IN FLORIDA AND SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE HAD OVER A HUNDRED. USA BOXING SANCTIONED EVENTS ACROSS THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT STATES CURRENTLY WE HAVE FORTY THREE EVENTS- SCHEDULED ACROSS THE STATES THAT ARE OPEN FOR US TO DO SUCH AND THEN- WERE VERY. EXCITED IN THAT- NEXT WEEK WE WILL HAVE OUR TWENTY TWENTY NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH WERE CANCELED- IN DECEMBER IN LOUISIANA WILL HAVE OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED BOXERS COMPETING IN FOUR DIFFERENT RINGS- IT WILL BE THE LARGEST BOXING BY USA BOXING EVENT IN OUR HISTORY- BUT AS OUR EXACT ARE. WATCHING DIRECTOR LIKES TO SAY IT WILL BE THE LARGEST BOXING EVENT WITH THE SMALLEST OF NOT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE NINETY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HERE- ARENA SO NO FANS LEVITATING BY EVERYTHING WE CAN DO. USA BOXING HAS FIFTY SIX NATIONAL OR LOCAL BY ACTUALLY COMMITTEES FOR THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A COMBINED OPERATION BUDGET OF A HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WE HAVE BEEN HEARING PANELISTS DISCUSSED OF LIKE UFC BY ANY FOSTER WITH THE- ATHLETICA. DOES AFFECT JOB WORKING WITH US BACKED UP BECAUSE WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION- WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE LIKE A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DO TESTING AND OR LIKE. A COLLEGIATE SPORT- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS AND I THINK- THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO ATTENTION IS YOU KNOW UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES USA BOXING- AND I'M USING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NUMBERS JUST BECAUSE IT'S- MORE ACCURATE OF WHAT WE'RE WE CAN SAYS STOP. YOU KNOW WE HAVE NINETY OR 84% OF OUR BOXERS ARE MINORITIES- AND THEN WE ALSO- AND THAT'S- UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. 72% OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN ONE OF THE PILLARS AS WELL IF YOU LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS THAT WE DO HAVE. LAST FEMALE BOXERS BUT THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME- OPPORTUNITIES WE DO NOT TREAT- BOXERS DIFFERENT IF THEY'RE MALE OR FEMALE- EVEN AT THE OLYMPIC LEVEL OF THE FUNDING IS EXACTLY THE SAME- FOR BOTH GENDERS. HOW ARE COMPANIES TO IMPACTED OUR MEMBERSHIP AND MOST YOUTH SPORTS GROUPS- WERE DOWN 67% OVER THE EXACT SAME TIME LAST YEAR SO THAT IS. IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR BOXERS OUR COACHES AND ARCHANGELS. CURRENTLY USA BOXING IS ONE OF THE WAR. ORG DELEGATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BY A CEASE ACT- CALIFORNIA MATURE MIXED MARTIAL ARTS CAMEL. UNITED STATES FIVE LEAGUE AND THEN THE INTERNATIONAL KICKBOXING MORE TYPE FEDERATION ALL OF US ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO ANY FOSTER AND THE- C. C. SACK. GROUP AND THEN ALSO THEIR EXECUTIVE BOARD AND ALSO THE COMMITTEE SO WE'RE HIGHLY REGULATED NOT ONLY BY WELL US NEWS WHEN IT COMES TO THE- UNITED STATES OLYMPIC PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE. IN CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO REGULATED BY THE ATHLETIC COMMISSION AND FOR THE SUPPORT OF AMATEUR BOXING WE'RE ALSO REGULATED BY FORTY NINE OTHER. STATES WHEN IT COMES TO BOXING. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE- SIX HUNDRED NINETY NINE GEMS LAST YEAR OR IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE PUT ON A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE EVENTS. WHAT WE'RE FINDING IN WITH. ALL OUR BOXING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT ARE YOU BOXES ARE SUFFERING WHEN IT COMES TO NOT BEING ABLE TO BE PART OR BE ABLE TO BE A WITH THEIR CULTURES WHICH ALL OF YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEING. A ATHLETE YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTORSHIP OF YOUR CULTURE IT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL GROUPS AND THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE OF EVERYBODY. BODY BELONGING AND THEN EVERYBODY TO A COMMON GOAL. USA BOXING SPONSORS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING WHICH ARE VITAL GLOVES NOT GUNS BOOKS BEFORE BOXING. AND WE ALSO. SERVE IN OUR COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THAT WE WOULD BURKE THE LOOK AT IS WE HAVE BEEN I DON'T. COM SPORTS YES HIGH RISK- BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS- IN BOXING IN SPECIALLY AND AMATEUR SPORTS AND ARE PART OF GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THEY ARE SHORTER THEIR INDIVIDUAL- CAN CONTESTANTS SO WE'RE NOT HAVING ELEVEN FOOTBALL PLAYERS GO AGAINST ELEVEN FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND ANOTHER. YOU KNOW TWENTY ON THE SIDELINES BY INDIVIDUAL SPORTS WHICH HELPS WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING IT ALSO LIMITS A LOT OF THE CONCERNED WHEN YOU HAVE LARGE GROUPS BECAUSE YOU ARE COMPETING ONE ON ONE. OF FOR USA BOXING THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF ANY BALLOT WILL BE NINE MINUTES. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE WELL WE HAVE FOUR FOUR OLYMPIC QUALIFYING BOXERS OF R. THIRTEEN THERE FROM CALIFORNIA AND I THINK RICHARD TORAHS FROM A CALIFORNIA- SUMS IT UP OF. WHAT WE THINK BASTON OF LIKE THREE TO LISTEN WHAT RICHARD HAS TO SAY. BUT A LITTLE TECHNICAL ISSUE. THE VIDEO SOUND ON THE POWER POINT IS NOT COMING THROUGH. OKAY I DON'T KNOW I AM IT IS. YEAH I'LL STOP SHARING. I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- RESIDENTIALLY WHICH RICHARD SAID IS THAT BOXING IS HELP CHANGE AND SAVE HIS LIFE LIKE MOST OF OUR BOXERS OUT THERE SO- AND HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO BE ABLE I HAVE KIDS BACK IN THE GYM- SO THEY CAN TRADE I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT OUR OLYMPIC QUALIFYING TEAM WILL BE IN CHULA VISTA FOR FORTY THREE DAYS ARE STARTING AT THE END OF THE MONTH- TRAINING AND GETTING READY FOR OUR OLYMPIC QUALIFYING EVENT IN ARGENTINA- WHICH WILL BE A MAY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE- OLYMPIC GAMES IN TOKYO SO CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE RESOURCE FOR US AND WE'RE LOOKING. FORWARD TO BE A BACK TO BOXING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. ALL OF YOU SCORCHED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU AGAIN WE- I AM CONTINUING TO HEAR THE SAME THEMES WHICH ARE AT. THE IMPACT ON OF COURSE ARE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES BUT CERTAINLY ARE YOUNG ADULTS AND WE KNOW THAT EVEN PREPARING FOR THE OLYMPICS IF THEY CAN'T GET INTO THOSE BOXING RINGS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AS COMPETITIVE AND WE WANT TO SEE THOSE CHAMPIONSHIP. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THAT ENDS OUR- THIRD PANEL AND WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT TO NOW- BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE OUR WEB ACCESS- THE MEMBERS HAD A WILL I KNOW IF THEY WANT TO ASK A QUESTION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THEM NO OUR ANY QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S GONNA MOVE US TO OUR LAST PANEL RECREATION YOUTH IN NY SPORTS COVERED NINETEEN PLANS ROUTE FOR RETURNING TO COMPETITION. AND THIS PANEL WILL END OF MANY MANY INCREDIBLE SPEAKERS BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEARD FROM EVERYONE AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE- THAT AS CALIFORNIANS WE HEAR WHAT'S WORKING WE HEAR THE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND ALSO- ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BEGAN WITH MATT DUARTE WHO IS THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RECREATION AND PARK. DISTRICT. YES GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU HEAR ME I HANG ON THERE YOUR- ALL RIGHT YOU'RE HERE GREAT. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MATTHEW TOWARDS A AND IN ADDITION TO BEING A FATHER TO THREE ACTIVE CHILDREN AGES TEN EIGHT AND FOUR I'M AN ATTORNEY A FORMER ELECTED OFFICIAL OF MY LOCAL PARKS BOARD AND CURRENTLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT SUPPORT. C. A. R. P. IT IS COMPRISED OF OVER SIXTY PUBLIC RECREATION PARK DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBER AGENCIES HAVE A SERVICE TERRITORY OF OVER SIX MILLION ACRES IN WHICH THEY MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A MULTITUDE OF LOCAL PARKS. OPEN SPACES AND COMMUNITY RECREATION FACILITIES THAT ARE VISITED OVER A HUNDRED MILLION TIMES EVERY YEAR. AND ARE PRESENTING A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE PUBLIC PARK AND RECREATION FACILITY OPERATORS IN THE STATE. WE REGULARLY PARTNER WITH THOUSANDS OF U. SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS TO OPERABLE I'D RANGE OF RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES DID YOU CALIFORNIA. NOW I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT TO SAY IT CITIES HEARING AND I COULD SHARE STATISTICS LIKE THAT FROM A RECENT STUDY WHICH FOUND THAT OPEN SPACES TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE PENCE VISIBLE WELLBEING. I COULD GO ON ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PARKS AND RECREATION AND MENTION THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS GENERATED PART LOCAL ECONOMIES. I CALIFORNIA YOUTH SPORTS TOURNAMENTS ALONE. I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE WELL DOCUMENTED HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE RECREATION FOR YOUTH AND ADULTS ALIKE. I COULD TELL YOU ALL THOSE THINGS. WHICH YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW IMPORTANT RECREATION IS TO OUR STATE AND IF YOU DIDN'T BEFORE YOU CERTAINLY DO NOW. WHAT ELSE WE KNOW IS THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF HEALING IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE FIRST STAGE OF A TRUE RECOVERY NOT JUST ECONOMIC BUT OF MIND. SPIRIT AND BODY THE FIRST AID TO BRING OTHERS TOGETHER AGAIN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD BALL FIELDS. OUR COMMUNITY CENTERS AT OUR LOCAL PARKS THE JOY THAT THESE ACTIVISTS BRING TO US ALL IT'S GOING TO COME AGAIN IT'S GOING TO COME SOON. NOT BEHALF OF THE PARKS AND REC PROFESSIONALS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I CAN SAY THAT WE ARE READY TO SEARCH. FOR DRESSING WHAT'S AHEAD FOR OUR SECTOR DID WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT SPEAK TO WHAT THE PAST YEAR IS DONE THE PUBLIC RECREATION PARK AGENCIES. RECREATION DOES NOT BEEN ALL FUN AND GAMES BUT THROUGH IT ALL WE HAVE SHOWN UP. REMAINING OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WHICH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE STATE. THIS OF COURSE IS EXPOSED AFTER THE VIRUS AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN OUTBREAKS AND QUARANTINE SAID OF STRETCH PERSONNEL EVEN FURTHER. SO OUR USAGE HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY SOME ESTIMATES THAT 40% GREATER FREQUENCY. OUR REVENUES HAVE DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY. RANCHO SIMI RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT IN SIMI VALLEY ALREADY RECOVERING FROM THE DEVASTATING WARS HE FIRED NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN A SENIOR REVOLUTION REVENUE LOSS EXCEEDING FOUR MILLION AND WAS PART OR STEPPER LOW OVER TWO HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE VALLEY WIDE RECREATION PARK DISTRICT OPERATES THE. TIME VALUE OF QUANTIC CENTER ABOUT I DON'T COMMUNITY RESOURCE AND HEMET. AND THEY HAVE. THREE HUNDRED. THOUSAND AND WITH POLL. AND THEY STILL HAVE TO EXPAND- OVER TO HER FIFTY. PER FOR WATER FOR CHEMICALS EVERYTHING THAT GOES INTO MAINTAINING AQUATIC FACILITY. THE CROSS THE STATE WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN LOST REVENUE. COUPLED WITH ADDITIONAL MILLIONS IN A BUDGET CODE RELATED EXPENDITURES AND JOB LOSSES IN THE THOUSANDS. AT THE SAME TIME PUBLIC RECREATION FACILITIES CONTINUE TO BE CALLED UPON TO SERVE AS A VITAL PART OF EMERGENCY AND DISASTER RESPONSE. IN ORANGE COUNTY SILVERADO MODJESKA RECREATION PARK DISTRICT HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE COMMUNITIES DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS AFTER WILDFIRES BLAZE THROUGH THE CANYONS. MISSIONARY AGENCIES FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CALLED UPON TO SERVE AS TESTING SITES AND NOW BACKSEAT CLINICS. CLINICS MAKING SURE THESE VITAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE ELDERLY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. PARKS AND REC SERVICES HAVE ALSO BEEN MODIFIED TO COMPASS DAYCARE IN DISTANCE LEARNING SERVING AS RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT DURING OUR STATE'S MOST PRESSING TYPEWRITTEN. BURKE PARKS AND REC PROFESSIONALS WE'VE CONTINUOUSLY ADAPTED TO WHATEVER CONSTITUENTS MAY NEED A DESPITE RISING TO THE CHALLENGE OF TWENTY TWENTY. OUR AGENCIES HAVE NOT RECEIVED A FINANCIAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO ENSURE. INDEPENDENT INDISPENSABLE SERVICES CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AND OUR EXPANDED TO ENSURE A FAIR AND JUST ACCESS. BOTH FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGES. FAILED TO DIRECTLY ALLOCATE ANY FUNDING TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHICH MEANT THAT THOSE AGENCIES PROVIDING CORE PUBLIC SERVICES LIKE RECREATION PARK DISTRICTS. HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST DIFFICULT FINANCIAL HITS AND RECEIVEDABSOLUTE ABSOLUTELY ZERO DOLLARS IN A WEEK. AS TO WHAT IS TO COME WE APPRECIATE THE GUIDANCE OF THE CDPH WITH RESPECT YOUTH AND ADULT SPORTS. WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO WELCOMING OUR PUBLIC BACK TO COMPETITION BUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES WILL COME AT A COST WITHOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THIS SPECIAL DISTRICTS LIKE RECREATIONAL PARK DISTRICT. THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN SPECIAL EVENTS AND OTHER RECREATIONAL OFFERINGS AVAILABLE. FURTHERMORE WE ALREADY LOST A YEAR OF USEFUL LIFE FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES AND I THINK IT LIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. SLOWED IMPLEMENTATION OF CAPITAL PROJECTS AND DELAYS AND OTHER NEW DEVELOPMENTS. THOROUGHLY JUST WANT TO END BY SAYING. WE DIDN'T STOP AND WE HAVE BEEN HIT PART OR AGENCIES ARE NOW CURRENTLY PREPARING TO STEP UP. IN ANTICIPATION OF A BUSY SUMMER SEASON. AND BELIEVE ME WHEN THAT NW GUIDANCE COMES OUT OUR PHONES ARE RINGING SO WE KNOW WHAT IS COMING IN AND WE WILL BE READY. BECAUSE FRANKLY OUR ECONOMY NEEDS IT OUR COMMUNITY IS NEEDED IN OUR CHILDREN. BUT SPECIAL DISTRICTS LIKE OURS TO BE GOING IT ALONE WE HOPE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON RELIEF TO COME SOON. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MATT EXCEPTIONAL TESTIMONY I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A- FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND NATIONALLY A PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSIONER. AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID IS SPOT ON AS- THINGS HAVE CLOSED DOWN LESS REVENUE AND AGAIN- THOSE ARE THE PLACES THAT PEOPLE GO TO FIRST. TO THE PARKS FOR PICNICS TO WALKING THE TRAILS. UP WHEN POSSIBLE THOSE YOUTH SPORTS AND OF COURSE. I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE- REALLY HOPING FOR SOME FIREWORKS THIS. FOURTH OF JULY AND THOSE ARE USUALLY UP PUBLIC PLACES SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED I NEXT WE HAVE CO FOUNDER OF LET THEM PLAY BRAD HENSLEY. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH EVERYONE SO. MY QUALIFICATIONS ARE- VERY UNIMPRESSIVE IN- WHY WHY I'M HERE TODAY I'M A I'M A FATHER OF. THREE I HAVE A FOOTBALL PLAYER AND I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE DANCERS. AND LIKE A LOT OF PARENTS AND MY WIFE AND I WERE VERY PATIENT THROUGH- THROUGH THE PANDEMIC I'M STARTING BACK IN MARCH- YEAH WE'RE PATIENTS OF THE SUMMER WHEN THE STATE PUSHED GUIDANCE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S COMING WHERE PATIENTS IN THE FALL. WHEN THE STATE PUSHED GUIDANCE THAT WE SAW ALL THESE OTHER STATES PLANE YOU SPORTS- AND THEN WE GOT THE GUIDELINES IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER IN TERMS OF THE TEARS AND WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED IN AND WE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT. THERE WAS NOT. SHORT OR EASY PATH. FOR OUR KIDS TO GET THE MUCH NEEDED RELIEF AND IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF ANYTHING. UNLESS THE KIDS GOOD FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL THEY WENT ON THE SCHOOL. PARKS WERE CLOSED CHURCHES WERE CLOSED AND THERE WERE NO SPORTS. SO- IT WAS MY WIFE AND I AND- WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WOULD CALVET WE STARTED A FACEBOOK PAGE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST ALONG WITH OUR THIRD CO FOUNDER- FRIEND AND ATTORNEY. YEAH I CAN HELP YOU. WE STARTED WITH THREE PEOPLE ON NEW YEAR'S EVE THE NEXT DAY WAS FIFTY- THE NEXT DAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED. AND WE STARTED TO GROW BY THOUSANDS EVERY DAY- AND THEN WE REALIZED. THERE ARE A LOT OF LIKE MINDED PARENTS OUT THERE AND ATHLETES AND COACHES THAT. WANT TO GIVE THESE KIDS A VOICE- YOU KNOW IN OUR OPINION. KIDS WERE THE ONLY ONE THAT DIDN'T GET TO RESTART. CRITICALLY EVERY INDUSTRY GOT A CHANCE TO RE OPEN BUT- THE KIDS THAT- BY THE END OF JANUARY WE HAD GROWN TO OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. AND WHAT STARTED AS A L. AS A SMALL FACEBOOK PAGE BY TWO PEOPLE BUT NEVER EVEN DID FACEBOOK BUT- WE'LL WELL THE SUDDEN. I HAD A MOVEMENT- OUR MISSION WAS VERY SIMPLE FROM THE BEGINNING AND IT REMAINS- AND IT REMAINS SIMPLE IT WAS- TO BRING BACK. USE SPORTS TO CALIFORNIA- SAFELY AND IMMEDIATELY. AND I THINK WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY WORKED WELL AS WE WANTED TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY- WE- WE DID NOT VIEW THIS AS POLITICAL WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T VIEW THIS AS- PARTISAN- WE HAVE STRICT STANDARDS IN TERMS OF MODERATING WHAT WAS ALLOWED. AND WE ARE NOT A RECALL SITE AND WE KEPT ALL THAT OUT OF THAT BECAUSE BASICALLY. KIDS THAT ARE PLAYING SPORTS THEY JUST WANT TO PLAY SPORTS ARE NOT DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS- SO WE CAPTURE THAT MISSION AND IT WAS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO KEEP FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE FROM CURRENT. GOING IN THAT ROUTE BUT I THINK THAT TRULY TRULY HELPED US ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL- SO HOW WE DID IT WE EMPLOYED A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES AND THERE'S THREE REFORMS OFF I'LL TALK ABOUT IS WHEN WE NEEDED TO GET THE DATA. TO PROVE IT WAS SAFE IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO OUR KIDS. TO WE NEED TO ORGANIZE TO BRING ATTENTION AND LEVERAGE THE MEDIA TERMS OF OUR CAUSE. AND THREE WE ALSO HAD TO GET SUPPORT FROM A VARIETY OF OTHER- RIGHTY EITHER ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA SO FROM A DATA STANDPOINT WE LOOKED INTERNALLY IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK AT THE- SPORTS THAT WERE PRACTICING UNDER CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS IS COLDAND WE GOT A MILLION DATA POINTSTO SHOW THAT THE KIDS. ARE VERY LOW RISK IN TERMS OF CONTRACTING AND SPREADING COLD INTO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. WE WENT NATIONAL TO THE FORTY PLUS STATES AT THE TIME THAT WERE SEIZED. SAFELY AND SUCCESSFULLY- COMPETING IN YOUR SPORTS- AND ALSO LOOK AT INDEPENDENT STUDIES- WE THEN TURNED OUR ATTENTION ONCE WE PROVE THAT WE CAN DO IT SAFELY. FOR YOU SPORTS WE LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. WE LOOK THAT THE SO WEEK. AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO WAS PLANS FOR CLUB SPORTS THE ONLY THE THAT COULD. IT MORE. THOUSANDS WERE TRAVELING OUT OF STATE THERE IS ONLY AND UTAH AND YOU NAME IT IN UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS THAT. JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO US. AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CYBER CRIMES BEING. COMMITTED AGAINST OUR OUR OUR OUR KIDS SUMMER STAFF IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO IS A MEMBER OF OUR COSTS AND- AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH. WITH THE MEDIA ITSELF VERY ALARMING. SO I'VE WE'VE- GOT THE DATA WE ORGANIZED AS GROUPS AND WE DID THAT RIGHT AWAY IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS WE DID IT THROUGH PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND RALLIES ACROSS THE STATE- BELIEVES JANUARY NINETEENTH. WE CONDUCTED A HUNDRED FIFTY OF THESE ACROSS THE STATE WITH OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND NOW PARTICIPANTS- VERY SUCCESSFULLY SOCIALLY DISTANCE MAST. GIVING OUR KIDS A VOICE AND I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE SAW HOPE IN OUR KIDS LIVES THAT. MAYBE MAYBE AMERICAN PLAY SPORTS. THE FINAL OUR STRATEGY THAT WE EMPLOY WAS ARE GETTING SUPPORT FROM THOSE THOSE AREAS THAT WE FELT THAT WE WOULD NEED IT. UNCLEAN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WERE MEDICAL DOCTORS AND- DISEASE SPECIALISTS- QALAT LETTERS. TO THE GOVERNOR SAYING HEY WE SUPPORT OF BRINGING BACK U. SPORTS. OF THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD SPECIFICALLY LIKE TO CALL OUT STEVEN CHOI. AS A AS A- AS AN ADVOCATE OF ARSIA- COAL- CO SIGNED A- BIPARTISAN LETTER- WHICH WE HAD THE MAJORITY OF. THE ASSEMBLY- SUPPORTING A LETTER WRITTEN GOVERNOR SOME TO BRING BACK OUTDOOR SPORTS. AND THE FINAL STRATEGY WORTH MENTIONING. WAS- WE LEVERAGE THE LEGAL SYSTEM. HE WILL PUBLISHED THAT INSTEAD DIEGO. WE ARE WE FILED. OF AN EQUAL UP. CLAUSE AGAINST THE COUNTY AND STATE. I'M NOT FEBRUARY NINETEENTH WE WON A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER THAT ALLOWED. ALL U. SPORTS IN SAN DIEGO INCLUDING INDOOR SPORTS. ASSEMBLY WAS OPREME TEAR FREE- FOR TWO WEEKS. UNLIKE THE REST THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY- OUR ATTORNEYS MYSELF ARE PLAINTIFFS IN THE STATE CAME TOGETHER. AND WE CAME WITH THE SETTLEMENT. THAT BASICALLY EXTENDED THE SAN DIEGO PROVISIONS TO THE REST OF THE STATE TO ALLOW ALL U. SPORTS. TO RETURN BACK TO CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO. DIFFERENT GUIDELINES OUTDOOR VERSES ON VERSUS INDOOR. THIS WAS A HUGE VICTORY FOR THE THREE MILLION KIDS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAD BEEN BENCHED- SINCE MARCH- AND. AND I CAN TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF MESSAGES AND- POST THANK YOU FROM TELLING ME THEIR STORIES OF HOW WHAT A BIG IMPACT THIS IS HAVING KIDS- THE FIGHT REMAINS NOW- THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF BATTLES THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT. FOR AS AN ORGANIZATION AS PARENTS I'M FOR EXAMPLE SPECTATORS THE STATE GUIDELINES ARE ONE SPECTATOR- OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY BASIS AND- THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO US WHEN YOU COULD BE LIKE AN OUTDOOR FOOTBALL STADIUM SOCIALLY DISTANCE WEARING MASKS. ONE PERSON KICK KIDS NEED THE SUPPORT OF THEIR PARENTS OF THE PARENTS AND THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR FRIENDS THERE'S A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT. ANOTHER THING THAT CAME OUT TODAY FROM THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ALSO NEW GUIDELINES THE CLARIFICATION IS THEY'VE BAND- SIDELINE CHEER. ON FRIDAY NIGHTS AND THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO US HOW CAN IT WE'VE PROVEN THAT YOUTH FOOTBALL CAN BE DONE SAFELY THAT'S A VERY HIGH IMPACT SPORT HOW. HOW SIDELINE SHEER SOCIALLY DISTANCE PROBABLY WEARING MASKS THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. NOT BE ACCEPTED SO VERY IDIOSYNCRATIC IN TERMS OF A LOT OF THE RULES OUT THERE AND WE'RE DOING OUR BEST AS AN ORGANIZATION. TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THIS- ON A FINAL NOTE LET THEM PLAY WILL NOT STOP EXISTING WE HAVE. TOO MANY MEMBERS INTO MANY CAUSES TO FIGHT FOR- WE'RE NOW FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE- AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER FUNDS AND WE'VE ALSO SET UP A FOUNDATION AND- THOSE ASSETS WOULD THEN BE DEPLOYED TO NEEDY ATHLETES AND- AT MEDIA ATHLETIC. PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND AGAIN THANKS THE PLAN. ON FOR. ALLOWING US SPLIT FOR. THANK YOU BRAD AND I FIND YOUR STORY REALLY INSPIRING THIS IS EXACTLY HOW YOU GET THINGS DONE NOT ONLY LOCALLY BUT THROUGH THE STATE IS BY ADVOCATING AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE DONE THAT I'VE HEARD OF YOU AND SEEING YOU. JUST ON THROUGH VARIOUS- I KNOW OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL HAD A SUCH A SMALL HIGH SCHOOL- LET THEM PLAY RALLY. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE PART. OF REALLY TRYING YOUR BEST NOT TO BECOME% OVERLY POLITICAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID WHEN I WAS A PARKS AND RECREATION COMMISSIONER AND THIS WAS QUITE AWHILE AGO BUT ALSO AN ELEMENTARY TEACHER. YOU GO ONTO A SOCCER FIELD IT'S NOT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WHO ARE PLAYING IT'S KIDS NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR COMMUNITY. TO COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHEN WE'RE AT OUR BEST SO I APPRECIATE THIS WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SENSIBLE THE- DECISIONS I DID HEAR ABOUT THE CHEERLEADERS AND THAT WE DEFINITELY THAT IS IN FACT A SPORT. AND I CAN TELL YOU I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS TODAY ST PATRICK'S DAY AND THEY GREW UP DOING IRISH DANCING. AND FROM THE TIME THEY WERE KINDERGARTEN TO HIGH SCHOOL GOING TO FESTIVALS IN PLANO- DANCING AT SCHOOLS AND- AMERICAN LEGION CLUBS AND FAITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS SO THEY'RE ALL IT'S A FAMILY AFFAIR WHEN IT COMES TO SPORTS AND- WE NEED THE SPECTATORS OF THE FAMILIES OUT THERE THE GRANDPARENTS EVERYBODY.

CALIFORNIA IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE SPORT A TRY APPLE. WE ARE THE ESSENCE OF HEALTHY OUTDOOR LIVING AND HEALTHY COMPETITIONS FROM AGE. EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED WERE PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY EVENTS EVERY WEEKEND UP AND DOWN THE STATE. 90% OF OUR INDUSTRY OUR SMALL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES OR NONPROFITS. THERE'S A STRONG NEED RIGHT NOW FOR IN CALIFORNIA TO BE SPENT. OPEN UP OUR INDUSTRY AND WE WILL WE FILL HOTEL ROOMS RESTAURANTS AND RENTAL CARS. YOU NAME IT WE DRIVE ALL AS A RESULT OF JUST DOING OUR JOB. INTERN SUPPORTS SPORTS SUPPORT NONPROFITS IN A NORMAL YEAR. ARE INDUSTRY IT WILL GENERATE NEARLY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CHARITABLE GIVING AND RABBIT. IMAGINE THE IMPACT OF THIS MONEY DISAPPEARING FROM THE NONPROFIT SECTOR IMPACTING EVERYONE FROM NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY NONPROFITS. ACCORDING TO THE AP ONE OR THREE NONPROFITS ARE IN FINANCIAL JEOPARDY FROM THE ECONOMIC SHUTDOWN ALREADY. WE NEED YOUR HELP TO RETAIN OPENS WE HAVE SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN OUR INDUSTRY. THOSE WAS MENTIONED AT THE OPENING AN ART WE OPERATE ON HUGE LEAD TIMES VERY LARGELY TIMES TYPICALLY NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS. ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO BUILD A HOME AND THAT'S OUR TIME FRAME FOR EVERY EVENT WE DO. ARBENZ ARE LARGELY AND- ONCE THE DATE PASSES THE BAN EXPIRES AND THEY'RE GONE FOR A YEAR OR FOREVER. BUSINESSES WILL CLOSE THIS FALL IF WE CANNOT GET SOME ASSISTANCE AND RE OPENING NOW. WE CAN REOPEN SAY FOR WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR NATIONAL GOVERNING BODIES WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND RESILIENCY OFFICERS TO ENSURE THAT WERE READY TO REOPEN. WE HAVE A SOLID PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN WHICH HAS BEEN VETTED BY MANY OF THESE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND IS ALSO ACCEPTABLE AND AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE. FURTHER WE HAVE SCIENCE ON OUR SIDE. WE ARE OUTDOORS THERE'S TWENTY TIMES HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CONTRACTED THE COBIT VIRUS INDOORS THAN OUTDOORS THAT. ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE STUDIES REPORTS THERE ARE NO NO NO KNOWN OUTBREAKS OF THE VIRUS FROM THE OUTDOOR ENDURANCE IT'S- IF WE ALLOWING HIGH CONTACT SPORTS AN INDOOR SPORTS DOES DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO US WHY OUR OUTDOOR. DISTANCE MODIFIED EVENTS ARE NOT HAPPENING THAT. WE NEED YOUR HELP IN THREE SPECIFIC POINTS. CREATE A SUBCLASS OF ENDURANCE SPORTS IN THE SPORTS THREE OPENING GUIDELINES PLACES ON THE OUTDOOR RECREATION SO THERE WE ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITY. SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RECOGNIZING THE SKI INDUSTRY IS A HEALTHY OUTDOOR ACTIVITY. THAT'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE DO. AND ALLOW US TO OPEN IMMEDIATELY WITH MODIFICATIONS THE SAME AS OTHER THAN ADULTS SPORTS. WE CAN DO THIS NOW AS A MATTER OF FACT FORTY TWO OTHER STATES ARE EITHER CURRENTLY ALLOW PAIN ARE CURRENTLY PLANNING AND PERMITTING. FOR SOME FORM OF ENDURANCE SPORTS. WE HAVE NO GUIDELINES FOR OUR BANDS WERE READY TO GO TO WORK AND WE CAN DO IT SAFELY. WE HAVE A SHORT VIDEO THAT DEMONSTRATES OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE- SPORTS SAFELY UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT COOPERATING WITH WEBEX SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE TO VIEW IT AS DIFFERENT TALK. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURTS OF THE ADVENTUROUS LIKE TO TALK TO AND GUIDANCE WE KNOW THAT THESE EVENTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO THE COMMUNITIES WE KNOW JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THAT WITH HEALTHY ACTIVITIES. LIKE OURS WE GENERATE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND PROVIDE OTHER DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED. THANK YOU MIKE AND I WILL SAY WE KIND OF AND WITH OUR FORMAL PRESENTATION OR WE STARTED WHICH WAS ME MAKING A PLEA TO- ARE- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DR ERICA PAIL IN HAND WHICH IS THAT WE REALLY THIS. ASSOCIATION ENDURANCE ASSOCIATION REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE GUIDELINES AS WAS NOTED NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS TO PLAN SO EVEN IF THEY WERE TO GET. SOME TYPE OF INFORMATION IN THE BLUEPRINT IN THE NEXT MONTH THEY'RE STILL NOT ABLE TO GET ANY EVENT OFF MAYBE WELL INTO THE FALL AND THIS IS CRIPPLING TO THEIR INDUSTRY. BUT ALSO AS WE KNOW TO ALL THE ATHLETES WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS SO THAT THAT'S JUST A COMMENT BUT I WILL- ASK OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS- WHETHER WEB ACCESS- HERE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL AND THEN WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. SURE I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS DONE ON AND ALL OF THE PANELS TODAY FOR THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION- A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I'M AN ATHLETE. AND IN HIGH SCHOOL I PLAYED BASKETBALL SOFTBALL VOLLEYBALL. I ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPORTANT TIMES- IN MY LIFE AND GIVE ME LOTS OF DIRECTION BUT I'M ALSO A MOM. A MOM OF A LITTLE GIRL WHO'S GONNA BE FOUR YEARS OLD IN A MONTH AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD BEING AND ROLLED INTO BALLS. AND THAT OPTION IS OPEN FOR HER RIGHT NOW. AND SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW IT AND- SO MANY CHILDREN THATNEED TO BE. IN SPORTS THAT NEED AN EMOTIONAL OUTLET THAT NEED A PHYSICAL OUTLET- FOR THE LET THEM PLAY MOVEMENT FOR BRAD. WHAT CAN WE BE ADVOCATING FOR AND DOING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE- FOR STUDENT ATHLETES. AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE- HAVE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF OUR PARENTS. OF OUR UNDERSERVED MINORITY FAMILIES WHO DON'T HAVE. THE FINANCIAL MEANS AND RESOURCES TO ENROLL. IN OR PUT THEIR CHILD CHILDREN- AND CLUBBER TRAVELING SPORTS. WHAT I MEAN THOSE ARE SO MANY GOOD QUESTIONS I HAVE I WAS THIRTY AND SOME TO MY HEAD AND THEN I THINK I LOST TRACK OF THEM LET ME START WITH THE LAST ONE IS THE UNDERSERVED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES RIGHT THAT'S A THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE AND THAT'S WHAT LET THEM PLAY IS GOING TO BE FOCUS MOVING. FORWARD I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE PARTNERED WITH CIS EXTENSIVELY- AS WE TRIED TO BRING BACK ALL USE FOR ITS FOR EVERYONE A LOT OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE TESTING. RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNEW TESTING WAS GONNA GET FIGURED OUT BY THE HIGH SCHOOLS THAT COULD AFFORD. AND TESTING WASN'T GONNA GET FIGURED OUT BY INNER CITY AND SOMETIMES REMOTE OR OR LOWER ECONOMIC- THEY SCHOOLS- SO THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT SUPPORTING- THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS OF INDOOR SPORTS THEY'RE ONLY DOING IT FOR OUTDOOR SPORTS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IS COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OF NO CHARGE FOR ANY ATHLETES OR ANY SCHOOLS THAT ACTUALLY WAS MOBILE AND WOULD GO TO THEM SO THAT THAT WAS ONE OF OUR BIGGEST WAYS THAT WE WANTED TO BRING BACK ALL THE U. SPORTS AND GIVE EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY WITH TESTING REALLY BEING THE BIGGEST BARRIER THERE. IN TERMS OF ADVOCACY WHAT WHAT THE ATHLETES NEED RIGHT NOW IS THERE IS THERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS ONE IS TESTING REQUIREMENTS- FRANKLY THE STATE IS BASED ON A LOT OF THE PROTOCOLS AROUND TESTING NOT JUST OUTDOOR VERSES INDOOR. BUT FOR FALSE POSITIVES- AS WELL AS WHAT HAPPENS- WHAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS POSITIVE AND THE OTHER KIDS THAT THAT HAVE TO QUARANTINE OURS ARE THOSE RULES THE MOST- RULES MOST UP TO DATE- I THINK. I MAY ALREADY MENTIONED- CHEER. I A A A BIG CONNECTED ISSUE- AND I THINK THAT. YOU TO BE TO GO TO THAT THEN ALSO THE SPECTATORS SO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PAGING YOU LOOK WHERE THE- CONCENTRATION IS AND IT'S PRETTY SPIRITED I PROBABLY MORE SCARED THAN I'D LIKE. THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT- WE NEED. WE NEED ADVOCACY ON AND WHERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. MOVING MOUNTAINS HERE I THINK THE MOUNDS ALREADY BEEN LET'S LET'S LET'S LOOK AT SOME. OF THESE IDIOSYNCRATIC POLICIES AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A WIN WIN. I DON'T THINK I ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT THAT'S- NOT A MATTER VICE CHAIR BY MAY- YOU KNOW BUILD ON THE LET THEM PLAY COMMENTS THIS IS KIM TURNER WITH FAIR PLAY FOR GIRLS IN SPORTS I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME BUT- I ALSO HAVE. A SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO WOULD LOVE TO BE PLAYING YOUTH SPORTS RIGHT NOW AND- A TWO YEAR OLD SON. WHO'S LOOKING FORWARD TO TALK SOCCER YOU KNOW AND- I AM UP HERE IN THE BAY AREA AND I JUST WANT TO CHIME IN AND SAY. I AM DESPERATE TO SEE ARGUED BACK ON THE FIELD IN THE GYMS IN A SAFE MANNER- AND I'VE TALKED A LOT WITH PARKS AND REC AND I APPRECIATE MATT DOHERTY'S COMMENTS. TODAY ABOUT HOW MUCH PARKS AND REC- SUFFERING RIGHT NOW. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT OUR LOCAL WONDERFUL PARKS AND REC FOLKS CAN WORK TO MAKE SURE VULNERABLE YOUTH ARE EXERCISING ARE GETTING SPORTS CONDITIONING OPPORTUNITIES. AS MUCH AS THEY CAN IN A SAFE MANNER AND MAKING SURE GIRLS ARE JUST AS WELCOME BACK BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF POP WARNER. FOOTBALL IN LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL JUMPING TO GET BACK BUT NOT AS MUCH. EMPHASIS ON THE GIRLS YOUNG GIRL'S SPORTS GETTING BACK OR THE CODE SPORTS GETTING BACK SO JUST MAKING SURE THERE'S A GENDER LENS. ON MAKING SURE ALL YOUTH REGARDLESS OF GENDER CAN GET BACK INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES PORTS IS KEY. AND THEN ALSO JUST SAVE. THE PRIVATE EXPENSIVE SPORTS ARE PRICING OUT A LOT OF LOW INCOME KIDS SO LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS CAN'T ALWAYS AFFORD A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A CLUB SPORT- YOU KNOW IT'S GOTTEN SO EXPENSIVE SO I THINK IF OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS CAN ENSURE THERE'S- SCHOLARSHIPS. AND EQUITABLE ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE YOUTH SPORTS CONDITIONING AND WORKOUT OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S GOING TO FIGHT THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW SUFFERING. A SUMMER BY OUR KIDS I THINK THAT COMMENTED I HOPE YOUR GIRL GETS BACK OUT THERE TO PLAY VERY SOON AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S KIDS THANK YOU. AND THEN ONE MORE QUESTION MANAGER IF YOU DON'T MIND. FOR MY PHONE YES- AS I MENTIONED- EARLIER IS A- DIRECTOR OF. SPEAKS OUR BROTHER BUTTER WERE WALL.

SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THEY'VE BEEN HAPPENING AT DIFFERENT EVELS WHERE THEY HAVE A NOT LIFE EVENTS BUT THEY'LL HAVE A VIRTUAL EVENT AND THEY'RE- RECEIVING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEY NORMALLY MAY.

I'D BE HAPPY TO SLICE UP THE ECONOMIC IMPACT I DON'T HAVE HER- BECAUSE FOR NONPROFIT HANDY BUT IT IS A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT'S GENERATED THROUGH AND THEIR EXPORTS. THINK BACK.
