this meeting will come to order my name is Jim Grayson assembly member for assembly district fourteen. And I chair the select committee. And I want to first. Thank everyone for being here good morning to you and welcome to the very first hearing of the assembly select committee on streamlining services for victims of interpersonal violence. The purpose of the select committee is to examine the colonel's. The victims of interpersonal violence face when seeking help from service providers and law enforcement. By reviewing how victims of interpersonal violence are being served. I believe that the legislature can gain important insight into the ways in which the state's current laws are being implemented. And ascertain whether changes are necessary to ensure that victims are receiving the best possible service and support. The focus of today's hearing is human trafficking and the crisis that California is facing. As you all know human trafficking is reported to be the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise. And in two thousand sixteen. At least it was labeled that two thousand sixteen and California was actually listed as the state with the highest number of reported human trafficking victims. In order to help the legislature remain vigilant in the effort to combat human trafficking in California. The select committee hearing will examine the nature of art of our state's human trafficking crisis and assess the services available human trafficking victims. Our goal is to shine a spotlight on the persistent and growing problem of human trafficking in California. And hear from those who work to serve victims of human trafficking by by prosecuting perpetrators and or by providing services to the victims. I believe that it's important to understand that where we are to that where we are today and what exist as far as issues than the current system in order to improve. And to move the needle forward to eliminate human trafficking in our state. Today I look forward. With our special guest and speakers to hearing testimony and being further educated on the issue of human trafficking. And working with you all as well by the way thank you to each and everyone of you for being here. Are working with you all as well on this very important topic and the work that you do that's very important on a daily basis to fight this crime. And also work to protect human trafficking victims. So today. We have. I do have colleagues and actually sit on this committee with me they are working very hard in their districts. I would like to list my colleagues that are part of this committee its assembly member Katherine Baker. Assembly member Jim Cooper assemblymember Jordan Cunningham assemblymember Eloise radius and assembly member Marie Waldron. And. I don't know if we have any other elected officials in the room. Outside of our VA who will be introduced here in a minute. For Alameda county. With that we are going to move into our panels now today's meeting is slated for. For no more than two hours. That doesn't mean we have to use the whole two hours. It's like. When I give my my my kid a twenty dollar bill to go out. They think they have to use the whole twenty dollar bill. So I've learned whether I get my five or ten or twenty it's all going to get used. So. We do have to our slated for it and. Speakers thank you.

What to block so welcome? To the panel and. The panel will give us an overview of California's human trafficking crisis. And I will simply ask for someone that I highly admire and the steam especially. For all the work you've done to protect and provide services to victims. Who also may I note? Serves on the national board for. Family justice centers and was very instrumental in the very existence of start of the family just center now meet a county which we went and toured and used as. A model to help us start right here in Contra Costa so thank you have a right to introduce an ask. District attorney or knowledge to begin. Today's panel. Thank you simply member very much for a couple of things one for. Being a champion in this area and I know that. That some to this issue around human trafficking one of my greatest concern is that. We have done a lot to educate people about the term human trafficking. But we cannot become complacent that somehow because we all know the language that we have solved the problem. Because we have not and so its hearings like this and attention from leaders like you that are going to help us to eventually get to a place where we can say. We have ended human trafficking in California. And I have hope and I have faith that we will all be able to do that. I'm gonna give an overview of some of the data that we have. And and a little bit of a background. Of a few years back well first of all my first human trafficking prosecution case was in nineteen ninety six. And it involved a twelve year old girl who's being trafficked by a thirty nine year old man. Who is selling her multiple times a night? And when she was finally separated or rescued away from. The from the purchaser the man that bought her he was a fifty year old man. And the police found her in a motel room with them they were both prosecuted by me. For rape. Of her and both were sent to prison for many years. And that was really the beginning of my education and my advocacy. On first learning as much as I can about human trafficking. And this insidious crime. That treats people like their chattel like they're human ATM machines and then secondly is to find the solutions to end human trafficking. And to serve those that have been victimized by this crime. But part of my effort has been also creation of the heat institute that he is human exploitation trafficking. And the institute. Isn't is a funded. Research institute focusing solely on California at this point. We've been hearings all over the state of California so we've gathered a lot of data about how our communities across California. Are responding to and managing their work to combat human trafficking so some of the information I will share with you comes from those those hearings that we did. But. In. Players and get it players project is one of the major players in the country. And that since two thousand and seven players project which managed as it manages the national hotline. There been over almost twenty two thousand calls from California alone reporting of incidents of human trafficking. Of those US. As sixty one hundred almost sixty two hundred actually resulted in cases in California. And all its spot sixty three hundred victims have been identified to Clarice now players is very quick to tell us that their hotline. So what they do is if somebody calls in a report that they direct it right back to the community I know that the the justice center here in Contra Costa. Is very involved in a zero tolerance in the various counties so they have. Identified those areas where those calls can be returned. But into from two thousand and sixteen to seventeen there were over four thousand calls from California alone to the national hotline. Thirteen hundred thirty one cases were reported in California. And there were. About a third of nine thousand or three thousand. Cases that moved forward or that were investigated were here in California two hundred and Oakland alone. And that's my community. Some statistics about buyers and I'm going to give a little bit of emphasis and when we talk about where we should be giving focus. It's on Byers because right now a person. Well we've changed a lot over the last couple of years to separate fires. From buyers of adult sex workers from buyers of children for sex. And I think this is an important piece of legislation that was passed because it allows us to really. Gather the data that we need to focus on who's purchasing children as in those that are on the spectrum for child assault for sex offenders. Are posed just engaging in adult sex worker which is a different dynamic. But we have given no attention and we have not increased the punishment of buyers of children. That's an effort I will once again introduce legislative a sponsor legislation so be our fourth year. Of trying to change the punishment for buyers who are fine children. In any event fourteen percent of the men in the United States report paying for sex fourteen percent that's fifteen million men. Who reported and admitted that they have bought? I paid for sex seventy five percent of the church children who are sexually exploited. Say they have been inadvertently sold. Online or they have been at advertised and sold online. And according to the New York University study thirty six of a percent of all internet content now is*. One in four internet searches for* and at any given time one point seven million. Users are streaming*. Our research shows that there's a direct link between*. And on the spectrum of human trafficking is a purchaser or as an exploiter. So we can't miss ought we can't ignore the impact of* on this issue. Locally I in my county one of our youth guidance centers are counting centers served a hundred twenty three you. Two thousand sixteen Missy and you'll hear from Dr Haitian maze later admits he served two hundred thirty four youth that are Oakland base you. Who are all victims of child sexual exploitation? And the Oakland police department at four hundred and five open cases. My office is prosecuted over five hundred and fifty. Human traffickers. Involving children. And we have an eighty two percent conviction rate so when I my message to my colleagues across the state is if you think people will not convict. Human trafficking because the victim oftentimes has Vona has vulnerabilities are the cases that vulnerabilities look at Alameda county eighty two percent conviction. Of those and that's been is cut a constant for the last several years. Fires in the bay area had incomes sixty one percent at incomes over sixty thousand dollars. The tech industry we have now discovered has a higher incident of purchasing so we just need to give. Some real attention to that. We have a safety net program which we've had since January of two thousand and eleven. A working group confidential. A protected by confidentiality working group meets every week and we have met every week since January first of two thousand eleven. And we have now almost eight hundred used in the database. And we use the database in order to educate us about. Common denominators a bike dynamics about areas where we should get focused. We've seen only about one percent male but we know that males are being exploited at a high rate. We also are seeing. More youth that are. That are. Trans gender. There's no question that for children particularly that the incidence of child sexual exploitation. Children of color are disproportionately represented. And in my county in the stats we have and I would just say that are the the people that we work with the young people. Are that we have information. That only about sixty three or percent are from Alameda county. We have children that are identified from other states and certainly from other counties in the bay area and for that reason. One of the efforts is to have regional responses as well. And we're out this particular bay area is very good at working between Santa Clara county contrast to San Francisco Alameda Solano now down into San Joaquin to really. Grow that regional response. But in my county sixty three percent of the children that primarily girls. Are African American about fifty percent Latina. And thirty five percent said that they had. Sorry seventy five percent had identified their own prior victimization. Hi incident of children who have run away. So some of the areas that we've identified that are of great need and we've given great attention to. Are. Housing. Of course housings an issue for everybody. But in this particular situation there is a lack of really of lack of housing for safe housing for children. Or for young adults who have been separated away from the exploiter who are. Who are getting out of the life for I've gotten out of the life? We are encouraging our communities to think out of the box the rules around foster care have changed regarding child sexual assault excuse me the. Sexually exploited minors it's a different licensing structure now. And so some of the traditional foster homes are not able or aren't going to be moving into that higher level. We are in Alameda county and another way we're thinking out of the box is we can't just rely on government. Funding although it's government funding is there. That we have partners who want to step up our faith community want to step up. Our of philanthropic community wants to step up. So one of the efforts that we're doing right now which is both Alameda and Contra Costa is that I reached out to Catholic charities to the bishop. A bishop Michael barber who is working with us and we are transforming an old rectory into a safe house. Long term housing therapeutic housing for minor girls. Or those that identifies female that will open this spring it's called Claire's house. And at the projection is five houses over the next five years in Alameda and Contra Costa county that our partnership with our faith community. Who and our faith and the people in our community as volunteers? Through the efforts of Claire's house we have talked to all the parishes in Alameda Contra Costa we have over a thousand people have signed up to be volunteers. To help work and support and help the healing of these children so that when they can get beyond. Their exploitive experience they can have the same opportunities and future that we hope for all our children. Housing is a big issue. Out the role of law enforcement change the last couple of years and it's been evolving but we change but that our legislature changed it. For sure sing case there's any questions and that is children are victims of human trafficking they're not perpetrators of crime. So we are we have re frame the way the law enforcement is working with exploited miners. In large part of being their protectors. Rather than. You know bringing kids into juvenile justice system. And I will say that again we've been involving to this point for a long time so the law which is the final part the broadest to there. But we just created a new protocol on using law enforcement advisers from all over the state for law enforcement so they can re frame how they're going to interact in the community. There is a lot of frustration about where can I take this child is on the street or I rescue out the internet one of my supposed to do next. And we're trying to answer those questions and help law enforcement and all communities figure out what that looks like. And then another area we discovered is that we know that a lot of children a lot of adults who are trafficked either labor or sex traffic. Are going to the hospitals and going to clinics for care for medical treatment so we're working with all of our hospitals in Alameda county. Developing a medical protocols doctor Mays is a member of the heel network. Yeah and they're an adviser to us so we are now working with each of those hospitals and physicians and we're looking at potentially proposing legislation. Or working with medical schools to make it a mandatory part of their medical training. To learn and understand human trafficking. And and then lastly. You know we many years back. When I when we got more organized and that was in the nineties. That we created what we what I call he'd watch human exploitation trafficking and the watch is where we engage community. And this is a five point strategy for communities to use as a guide. What we do in Alameda Contra Costa county may not be the same in Fresno or? Merced county but this is a guide that will it help all communities. And the five strategies are what working with law enforcement to help train law enforcement because very often they are the first responders they're the first to have encountered to encounter someone. Is being trafficked the second was we have to prosecute traffickers. With the many traffickers will continue exploiting and continue finding children to exploit and adults to exploit so they we just have to hold them accountable. The third one is. To make sure that we have strong community support and by that I mean and you're gonna hear from the panel later so I won't go into it. But organizations that are in place to help. Those. As they are separated away or moving into their recovery. That. Those nonprofit non government organizations need to be supported and strong. We've been changing the law since the early since the late nineties thank goodness to members like assembly member Grayson who hears the cry and understands the need to change the laws. And then lastly that it we have to engage our community this is human trafficking awareness month. We've we have to engage our community because. This is a crime that is hidden in plain sight. And the more we. Have our community be the eyes and ears and recognize human trafficking and then a resource for what they can do once they see that. The more we are going to. Change the whole paradigm of this community of this society. That would allow this to exist the last thing I say is we did Pat the legislature did pass a law. A few years ago it was SB eleven ninety three which requires. Thirteen different types of businesses to post a poster. That has some information about human trafficking but importantly the national hotline and we've added the text line. I can tell you that we've done days of action with the with the family justice center. In a country Costa we do I'm all the time in Alameda county there are wonderful volunteers to do that. We created an app to really engage communities so when I go to a restaurant if I don't see the sign I can go on the app. Call at that restaurant push a red button that says they're out of compliance with California law this isn't just a feel good I wish everybody would do it. This is the law. And so we push the button the district attorney's office the attorney general's office have the authority to do administrative. Enforcement the fine for failing to put them poster up in a conspicuous place is five hundred dollars for the first offense and a thousand dollars for every offense after. And it is my feeling that and this is what we're doing in my county that as we find businesses that don't comply with the law comply with the law. That some of it can fund the compliance officers but that can go right back into a pot. For services for those that have been exploited. The businesses that are not following the law can help us build the networks and the resources to help people get beyond this experience so. If I know country Costa we've been uploading all the businesses into the database so they can continue to. Days of action through the leadership of the justice centers. And any other community in California is welcome to it we have the apt we will share it with anyone. And let's get those days of action going throughout all of our cities and all of our counties in California. Thank you. Thank you so much district attorney o'malley and what a great presentation will move out right and to amend up listeners human trafficking coordinator for the. DOJ. Thank you to terminate said in the members of the subcommittee from biting the department of justice here today. I'm I'm pleased to be representing Attorney General. Sarah in the department of justice after the hearing and the department office of long prioritize the fighting instrument half king and continues to do so today. As you've heard I'm from both German Grayson and from MTA o'malley that statistics. Nationwide worldwide but particularly in California really staggering grew up with no choice but to lead the fight against human trafficking. At. At the department of justice we use what's called the four peas approach to combating trafficking. At the Ford he's. Is that a good approach outlined in the national United Nations trafficking in persons protocol. And it includes prevent. Prosecute. Attacked in partner. And our goal is to focus her work on each of those areas. Most recently on the prevention front the department of justice. Supported it work to pass assembly bill twelve twenty seven I've that bill. Outlaw mandates human trafficking it education in public schools throughout the state. I'm. That education helps students to protect themselves and protect each other and make sure that every young person understands that commercial faxes not a victimless crime. The curriculum called protectors originally rolled out a role communities than there is an expansion and will now be available to students statewide. And data is also being collected to evaluate the effectiveness of this educational curriculum. Data collected from seventh and ninth graders show that ninety five percent of the students who have been educated. With this curriculum felt that they could identify trafficker tactics after receiving that training. In addition our office continues to enforce. And implement. Statewide anti trafficking initiatives like I feel I've been ninety three which damn alley mention which is. I recently been amended. By SP at two twenty five which require the department of justice to create. And it enumerated entities to post a human trafficking I'm. No death that in. Includes multiple types of reporting it information that phone number and dad and awaited fended information by text message. We're working with the state agencies responsible for oversight of some of those covered entities tie identify implementation gaps. In any need for enforcement actions. By the department of justice for other other locally add prosecutorial entity if. The department office also works tirelessly everyday at stake traffickers off the street by investigating and prosecuting offenders. The department of justice houses a multi agency task force in San Diego. The task force comprised of local state and federal law enforcement. Service providers and prosecutors. And that it has for tape task force takes a collaborative a regional approach human trafficking which is the met with much success. Last year the task force arrested at ninety three traffickers. Eighty nine of those traffickers faced state charges for face to federal charges. In addition to those charges. Are the task force if this provided assistance and support to fifty eight back down. And conducted twenty one trainings in the San Diego area for students government employees law enforcement officers in the public. Those trainings are geared towards raising awareness and making sure that everyone in the community in their workplace are in their day to day lives is able to identify trafficking when they see it. And knows what to do out when they've identified at. In addition it. This past year the department of justice is filed a number of top ad cases against human traffickers. One such case was filed. In the. The middle of the year was against. Three defendants who were charged with. Fraudulently procuring a luxury residential units and cars which they then proceeded to use to traffic thirteen victims up and down the state. Including eight miners. Just a couple of weeks ago two of the three defendants pled guilty. Wanted twenty eight years and one to eleven years I'm an outcome we are very pleased with. In the course of this work we also take I very careful steps to protect. The survivors who we encounter. We work closely with service providers very early on from that very. Start of our investigations to make sure that. Victims and survivors needs are met. At each step of the way both mental health needs it though think that physically than any other needs add that. The individuals may have. The exact nature of the support and services that are provided. If of course determined in a substantial part by the needs of that particular individual. But they can include a. Housing mental health the drug and alcohol counseling. Emergency housing in basic needs like medical care food and clothing. Service providers we work with are also available to shepherd survivors through the court process. And at that survivors election it to stay on that support them even after the close of the case. Additionally attorneys in office take. Take steps to ease the burden of it. That survivors have facing a trafficker in court. I am for survivor that is a very very challenging oftentimes most times. To go to court. To look their trafficker in their faith in the face and a half to describe sexual encounters. And. Other awful things that. That took place while they were being trafficked. We try to assist in the. To assist them in that endeavor and to make it. Too easy the burden to the fact that we can we do a few things. The first is we will. Take survivors who are who are at anticipated to testify to court in advance of whatever hearing or have to buying in to do a courtroom that that. I that enables the survivor to get a lay of the land to see the court room to go up on the witness stand that actually experience what that will feel like. And even though it's. Generally empty courtroom at that time but to have that first step. In feeling quite that testimony will feel like you were able to upgrade to answer any questions. And. To do anything we can to to warm up the environment for that. Individual up. We also work. Arrange for. Anything survivor who is testifying who would like to have a support person available to actually have that person up on the witness stand with them to. To provide additional support at the time of testimony in front of. Add the trafficker in the public a Jerry. And lastly we. Would go out of our way to make sure that the audience is filled with familiar faces and. Add that there is additional security in the courtroom so that I need. Survivor who we have to testify knows that they are safe and supported. As this collaborative approach with service providers have you but many successes. I purchased a few examples. I last year on. That. One case we worked at the service provider to get. Eighteen age a trafficking victim back into school so that she could receive. Her GED and she is now taking classes at a local community college. Have. And more recently we at the citadel picked on. Who? With an ad desperate need of substance abuse treatment and after. Getting. Part way through that treatment. That. That survivor was able to share with us that this was the first time in ten years that she had left. The life and was not under the control of a trafficker Pam. And that she had. As a result the calm the a better mother to her children. Finally we partner with government agencies advocacy groups and service providers to train a broad range of people up and down the state. I in the identification reporting with you in trafficking it's often these folks did not law enforcement. Who are best positioned to observe trafficking in their community either in their workplace as? For example we've trained government employees who. Perform building in code enforcement work. In the identification of traffickers in those locations I've trafficking victims in those locations. We've trained healthcare hospitality workers are identification of trafficking victims in the hospitals and hotels. And we've trained teachers who are. Around here the whispers in the hallway into notice a change in a child's demeanor behavior. Despite our best efforts there are of course still gaps in our sport I've trafficking survivors. I would reiterate that point that the a rally made about how things specifically for I. juvenile trafficking survivors. Do the Taliban that forms between it I trafficking survivors. And their traffickers. Juvenile survivors signatory flee right away from whatever placement it is that they're put in. I despite law enforcement's best efforts to keep them safe. Fortunately there is a significant shortage of safe victim oriented placements for juveniles who been trafficked. Juvenile hall they're not the proper place for the survivors that they're victims of crime not criminals. But urban foster. Group foster homes or group homes are also not. The right place. Those locations lack the the structure and the. Staff who are trained in commercially sexually exploited children. And. Better really necessary for the. For the juvenile. Ad trafficking survivors it to. To thrive. And it to heal from the trafficking situation that they were at. At. Example that we've experienced my office related to that wise. In a recent case where juvenile trafficking Sir at. You're the victim. Than survivor ritualized located in central California the trafficker was in southern California. That young woman traveled several hundred miles on her own. Three times. To be to re unite with her trafficker despite having being rescued were covered by law enforcement. And each of the previous times. It wasn't until she was placed in this case that her parents expense. A camp in a rural town out of state. That she was able to break free of the traffickers mental control over her. You really begin to heal. And. It begins to get back to the place that she was before she was initially contacted by the proper. And despite the research gaps that remain in the hard work that that is certainly a lot to do with the fight against human trafficking is under way. And we can't allow and won't allow traffickers to continue to. Target very vulnerable that segments of our population. Nor what will we are kind we allowed the. Strong survivors of this crime to be left behind. The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer of the state. Is committed to continuing the strong work I've his predecessor. And remaining a leader in the fight. And we look forward to continue discussions. In partnership with legislature to stop human trafficking and provide victims of the critical services they need to be survivors. And it to thrive. And thank you again to chair and the members of the subcommittee for having the department of justice here today and I look forward to answering any questions. This was not thank you for your presentation and we will before questions come. Which we do have some. Before they come we will turn to our final panelist to speak and present. Mister Aaron to fari for a deputy district attorney for cost cost accounting thank you for being here. First they determine very. When the. Thank you chairman Grayson for putting this committee together. I really do want to emphasize what this return your mallee already said which is but we appreciate your ongoing efforts here we want to make sure that human trafficking is not. Just a flavor of the month or flavor of the year type of crime where everybody learns about it and then like district attorney o'malley said we become complacent. Because we've already heard about it so thank you for continuing this fight we really do appreciate it. The next person I would think is district attorney o'malley. It's I think it goes without saying but I'm gonna say it anyways she has been the tip of the spear. And her offices been the flagship in fighting human trafficking in California we have modeled a number of efforts that we've undertaken is chairman grace and set. Off of what she has done and we. I feel a little bit out of place sitting next to her on a panel like this but I'll do my best. What I want to talk about today? And what I think is relevant for the conversation you're starting here. Is there's two two issues I want to talk about and one is the need for multi jurisdictional efforts in our county. To attack and prosecute human trafficking operations particularly large scale. Human trafficking operations and the next topic I wanted to address after I talk about that is what's already been touched on by deal Nelly. And a representative from DOJ and that is addressing how to meet victims where they are and more properly how to ensure that they become survivors of human trafficking. And just the partnerships that we are required to forge and make that happen and it's it's not easy especially the county as diverse as ours with as many different jurisdictions as we have. Our county is a little different we have all types of different populations here and so it's not always easy to coordinate those efforts. But I'm proud to say that I think we've made great progress there. So first in terms of multi jurisdictional investigations what we've discovered but what we have not yet perfected and we're working hard to accomplish. Is developing a task force approach to trafficking. Investigations specifically we have a really frankly FBI safe streets task force here in Contra Costa county they partner with us and our agencies and specifically the DA's office. To attack large scale criminal enterprise and problematic. Particularly criminal street gang violence issues and as part of that we have accomplished several large scale human trafficking investigations through for example wire taps. A one of the. Investigations we managed to accomplish that was particularly surprising was a human trafficking operation that had been running out of Danville for approximately fifteen years and also parts of Alameda county Livermore. In Dublin. And it was one individual named James Joseph junior who had been running women adult women across the country. For fifteen years starting at approximately two thousand or two thousand one Mister Joseph had trafficked victims all across the country. And his method was he would lie. To the women you would me he pick on eighteen nineteen twenty year old women he tell them they were beautiful. And that they would be models or maybe make up artists and we travel across the country and make hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mister Joseph was a very good con man. He dressed the part he had their expensive cars he had rented a number of very nice houses from San Ramon to Danville which is. One of our more affluent communities in Qatar Costa county. And he would learn these women in and after two or three meetings and he would bring his other girls the other survivors the other trafficking victims with him. And they would play the part of success model. He would bring them in and after two or three appointments he would get the next victim alone. Raper tell her he had all of his information all of her information rather. And then he would say you're going to be in the trafficking ring or I'm going to kill your family. A Mister Joseph it pull that off for fifteen years. Fifteen years he had been arrested by the federal government on more than one occasion. Is trafficking activities had been detected in New York. Ohio places like that but at the time. We didn't recognize as a society. Or is the law enforcement community. What human trafficking look like and so when he was arrested for these crimes it wasn't fully appreciated the scope of what he'd been perpetrating so we just a short stints in federal prison? But he kept at it. Finally in two thousand and fifteen through some incredibly alert work by members of the San Ramon police department. They listened to one of his survivors one of Mister Joseph survivors speak at a human trafficking awareness conference. He brought the case to San Ramon police department. They did a lot of surveillance work and our human trafficking. Deputy will we have one human trafficking jeopardy in Contra Costa county now and we're working to increase that. But they brought it to our office we got together with the safe streets task force and initiated a wiretap investigation. And what that wiretap investigation turned over was just what I said Mister Joseph it conducted a nationwide human trafficking ring. For sex for the better part of fifteen years. We brought a forensic accountant in an eBay roughly. One point five to two million dollars per year running the human trafficking ring. Through the wiretap investigation and some phenomenal work thanks in large part to. Our partners who sponsor a victim witness advocacy program at the California department of justice and the state. We were able to develop a number of victims. Put Mister Joseph and his partner his common law wife on trial for human trafficking and multiple counts of rape. That investigation came to a successful close actually less than three or four months ago and Mister Joseph. Was sentenced last week to a hundred and seventy four years to life in the state penitentiary. Which is absolutely the right result but it was a lot of work and it was only made possible by the cooperation of multiple jurisdictions and the FBI safe streets task force. We need to expand that. What DA o'malley is done in her jurisdiction by creating he task force is a great model to follow? It obviously each county each city is unique and Carter Costa needs to have its own solution but one that looks a lot like what DO now is done. The head of our sexual so unit right now senior deputy district attorney Paul graves is working hard. To create a human trafficking task force a one day is not being. Somewhat multi task if you will with combating gang violence because that's incredibly important and they've made tremendous strides especially with the freeway shooting epidemic we had here. But also focuses on human trafficking because that deserves its own taskforce and that deserves its own resources. So we're working to create that. We need more support we need more help our law enforcement agencies have been tremendously supportive of that and we hope they'll continue to do that. The next topic I want to talk about is streamlining victim services which which is a large part of why we're here today. And. Again I want to commend. German Grayson and a number of the elected officials in our county who have worked to bring us to family justice centers. We have Susan came here today who. Has done a ton of work in that area and we we couldn't be happier with what we've achieved and again. This is more of a approach where we've learned a lot by watching what Alameda county is done. And we've created two family justice centers and the I think the strength of that is we've created a type of one stop shopping if you will. For victims of family violence. Victims of sexual assault and particularly victim of victims of human trafficking. Those are great strides forward but we can still do more. What we've seen and we started to dress your day and I think it's really important is that we don't have enough beds just just plain and simple? Our infrastructure in terms of how we how is vulnerable victims or survivors of human trafficking is completely lacking. We don't have safe places for them to go and there's tension especially for our. Minor victims of human trafficking there's a lot of tension between what was already identified where do you put a minor victim of human trafficking because we know that. Group homes foster homes those can be places where they're re victimized or their re recruited back into trafficking rings. So we need places that are completely focused on human trafficking we need more bed space is available and we need to have those accessible through our family justice centers. And those places do have to be task specific meaning for human trafficking victims they need to address some of our most common ailments are most common. Syndromes that affect our human trafficking victims such as post traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse because many of our traffickers. Many of our traffickers use drugs such as methamphetamine heroin cocaine a number of the prescription drugs that are abused today to get. A young women addicted so they can keep them in their employ it's. Manipulation method are traffickers use so we absolutely need to have trafficking spaces trafficking beds available where those types of. Shoes are dressed. And. I think one other part of that and and it's already been discussed today. But I do think coupling or. Multiplying or increasing our efforts with partner partnering with nonprofit organizations non governmental organizations is something we still need to work on this county we are. Getting there but we're not there there are brilliant organizations a Catholic Church is definitely stepped up in a lot of ways but we have other non religious affiliated organizations like pillars of pillars of hope is religiously affiliated but. Arm of care which is a great organization does a lot of work with human trafficking victims specifically trafficking victims we need to. Continue to build our relationships with those types of organizations. I would. Finally like to mention that. There is one last field of human trafficking they were still building out into and you're gonna hear later today I believe from Louise Reeves who works for Pittsburgh police department she is a. Resource that we could not do without I've said before I'll say it again I wish we had ten Louise Reeves is but intelligence analysis for human trafficking. Is a monster part of the equation to effectively attack and prosecute you and trafficking I would I guess I'd add this back into my multi jurisdictional approach we need to take a social. Networking intelligence analysis to how we attack human trafficking and for example in San Francisco a lot of the way that they deal with gang violence and they investigate gang violence. That takes place when they look at network analysis they look at who contacts to who knows who and they build out complicated nexus maps to determine where violence will occur next it's pretty sophisticated model. Louise Reeves at Pittsburgh Pete is taking an intelligence analysis approach to determining where and when human trafficking is occurring we need to do that on the next level. And I think that that doesn't have to be individualized departments are in visual police departments I think would be an excellent addition to human trafficking task force. So thank you gonna some women. Should the time. Thank you for your presentation deputy de eight of ari and. Your presentations for all three of you were fantastic. I I wrote down a couple of quotes here. Because it was said and I I have just a a question I'm gonna ask you that we're gonna get on to the next panel. So I'm sure we will be able to exhausted today about something for you to think about and hopefully a provide some feedback to my office. Because I really do want to provide some assistance to be a resource to you. Some statements were made that that traffickers if not prosecuted will continue to traffic. And then the quote we have to prosecute traffickers and then. It was made known by this place for one of the four pieces prosecute. And then. A comment that was made quote unquote we need more help. The question that I would have for you is what barriers currently exist that would limit or impede your offices efforts to prosecute human traffickers. And part to that question is what can lead just what can lead to the legislature do to help law enforcement combat human trafficking and assist the victims. Well. Part of the part of the challenge is that. That. Those that have been trafficked some don't trust the system because they've been trained and taught not to. So they don't necessarily see the police as their protector. But that's the first thing the bonding that. That miss builder talked about is real and we need to make sure that we are providing. A lot of support to those that are separated away from the trafficker. For them to be able to come into court and testify. I your legislature has passed several of bills which I'm proud of sponsored about. Having closed circuit TV testimony and doing are taking conditional examination testimony early on before the case actually. Hits the the trial stage and I think those are important tools. But I do believe that. That we need to in order to successfully prosecute we need to have witnesses. And so how we're able to support. And provide the resources to those victims and witnesses early on. Is really critical to their ability to stay with us and be available to come and testify. Excellent thank you. One of the most significant. Barriers continues to be resources. Other mentioned we have. The department does that house is a tough sport and see an ego that has been quite successful however. At the department is only able to see currently to staff that have forced with three agents including a supervisor. And. So in short our court allocating additional resources to this collaborative regional. Mold. Approach to human trafficking that we've seen it at be successful both at the scene a good half fourth I know in the in Alameda county. Is well and. I I think would be something certainly to address with additional resources we would be able to grow the existing task force. I'm the DOJ houses and ideally replicate that passport. And central California northern California so that there is a greater reach an ability to investigate. More traffickers arrive to prosecute war traffickers. I think at second exactly what's been said so far in in an. Ad that in our office unfortunately to date there's typically been one for the last four years assigned deputy district attorney to prosecute human trafficking. The truth is we need more it these are very complex cases they I often say that they're sort of the marriage in a bad way between gang prosecution and domestic violence prosecution because our witnesses are unwilling. And they're very mobile. Are unfortunately are survivors are very able to go from one place to the next so the management of the case takes a lot of time. I will say that I am I am appreciative of the efforts for example assemblywoman Baker I know sponsored legislation to make all human trafficking prosecutions vertically prosecuted. Meeting one prosecutor handled the case from the filing to the end of the case from cradle to grave if you will. So I simply think we need more resources and that. Goes hand in hand with the bell being our human trafficking task force. So obviously resources are limited on every level we're all feeling the crunch. I know that. If I if I am correct. That to and this is a little off. Maybe topic but what will bring it right back real quick because we have to get to the next panel. But. In in drug enforcement. When there is an arrest. And prosecution there are. Seizures of assets. Is that something that also exist in the trafficking world where you can. Seize assets and use that to actually help the healing side or of victims. Yes so am. In the loop like two thousand. Eleven twelve thirteen. We will eat the legislature was able to enact legislation that added human trafficking to the forfeiture statute. The place where we see resources that are identifiable is in labor trafficking. And we've been very successful at seizing. Buildings and businesses and then being able to provide research restitution to the victims or to pay for their. For their finding the victims of crime fund which is something that people don't always think about. That all prosecutor office in the Attorney General get funds for. And that is to. Provide counselling for victims and it does provide for relocation if there's no safe place. And so that those are resources that are there. To help. Augment. The. The forfeiture but in the sex trafficking it's. Again it's a fluid for most of what we see are lower level traffickers. Are the big cases like the case in Danville. That case. I would expect that under most circumstances seizing the house and selling the house is completely within the realm of. The law enforcement authority or the prosecutors authority with course with the court. I and that. Read those resources can become. Restitution or they can also go back into. Of being able to support that counties. Efforts to continue the work excellent thank you very much and thank you to all the panelists that we were I really appreciate your presentation. They're worthy of a good hand from us audio so we have. We will now transition to our next panel and. We will be able to hear from law enforcement and. Their response to human trafficking. And. While there a while the transitions taking place I do wanna think district attorney o'malley this place near a deputy district attorney to fari for. The excellent testimony presentation. And. As we are inviting the next panel up to the Dyess. I will. Introduce them. And we have with this corporal. Tony Gilliam. Now with the Concord police department. And we also have Louise Reeves the community service specialists with Pittsburgh police department as well. Yeah. We are entering our last half of the time for the panel so we look forward to hearing from. Part two presenters. And I will simply reach out and. Have. Corporate Killian if you want to go out and kick it off just make sure you get the little button on the side. Green light comes on go for. I think you for others here Sir. I'm actually have a Louise reason start with the most the conversation she doesn't mostly heavy lifting. I recently laughter special victims unit on back on the street and want to be motivated my squad to be focusing on this on a daily basis. Well nightly basis of working nights. But Louis is gonna go into more the in depth. So be it let's do it. Good morning thank you chairman grace of having us here today. I'm. I'm surprised to be here but this is just as great I'm so excited that call to Costa county is really recognizing the problems that we have out here. I am. What is a community service specials the pits but please department I'm not a police officer? I have for the last ten years been investigating my weight juveniles. And over the lost. Basically since two thousand eleven when I had my first trafficking case. I really recognize that this is a giant problem that we have here in Contra Costa county. My first case was a girl she was fourteen years old she was picked up on railroad Avenue in Pittsburgh. By two guys who wanted to invite her to a party. Of four hours later she's in hot topics in Alameda meeting a man for a date. In the short time that she was the way she was taken to. Hotels in Union City Hey would. At San Jose Monterey and down to because filled. It was then that I learned how multi jurisdictional this problem is I'm how we all have to work together. It was actually the case actually sent to because I had no crime in Pittsburgh at that time it was actually fought by a union city down in Alameda county. Big I have for me. Fourteen years old my daughter at the time was fourteen. The. The victim ended up being my told his. Best friend's cousin. So that's really kind of what board come to me just how close this is and how how it affects us Texas all. So we were given today some questions. And I kind of just a bullet point I didn't know how to kind of present this so one of the questions was was has a human trafficking changed. Yes in the last ten years I've seen big changes in this and especially since two thousand eleven. And the biggest change for me as well. Arent differ are you just spoke about. Was the social media. I am seeing off. Social media just explode with. Pandering. You know recruitment I monitors social media and and justice quick case a few weeks ago I had my I have multiple screens on my desk. And I had my Facebook feed up and Facebook live popped up this that young man trying to get to go into a vehicle. I this kind of. Struck a red flag with me so I did a a workup on this this gentleman he lived in Antioch. And it during the work up I found his phone number and that phone number was a satiated to prostitution acts. I said all this information over to Anya out PT annual PP started building a case on him in the meantime I had a runaway juvenile from Pittsburgh. And. Richmond PD picked up they sent me a picture they found on her cell phone. From her Instagram account and then like do you know this guy and I'm like well yes I do. trying to get and I got into a cough so this is why all social media has to be monitored I'm on it I literally I'm on it even a home at eleven o'clock at night. Just scrolling through Instagram Facebook life Snapchat I don't tweet I don't have time for it. So I'm big. Big changes that. Another change I've seen is. It's been glorified. You know we have this glorification that we have comedy be we have Nicki Minaj we have JZ all rapping about human trafficking. And it has been glorified with sending this message to all our youth that this is okay and it's not. I seen a big big changes and that. We talked I am saying. Pandering for the internet I just had a case of a girl who returned home she was a Pittsburgh run away. As she let me look up her phone and what I was going for her phone they don't think I'm going to be able to find much on the phone they don't think I'm really that sad because I'm a fifty year old grandma. But I know my way around the phone and as I was going for this phone I found that she was being pandered by her friend a seventeen year old friend was telling her to contact an exploiter. In Sacramento to make money. That's just not acceptable when did it become OK to friends to refer friends to exploit as. One the other things I'm seeing is tattooing and branding. I've got girls as young as thirteen but tattoos of the exploit its name on them. And this is kind of late on the list I want to talk about maybe we mandating them as mandated reporters if they suspect human trafficking and possibly going after these. Tattoo artists for tattooing a thirteen year old it's illegal. So I'd like to see sort of more that. I am seeing more about victims being trafficked in more affluent areas. Before the fires and I had quite a few up in the Santa Rosa area assignment file seen them going down to Santa Clara I'm not saying it's not still happening over in Oakland I know it is. But I am seeing that's where the money is. Diego Maddie talked about of the tech industry you know that that heading down to that area. What are we doing? Social media monitoring I'm like I said I'm on it all the time. I monitor a prostitution ads I go through the pages I go through the back pages I go for the night shift at night shift has a lot of information. Out there are few matlab and to manage your way through that. We investigate or suspicions of HT you don't become threatened by. Mandated reporters through the. Sub social workers will for the schools we investigate everything nothing is now suspicious circumstance we look at the. That were investigated. Working with other agencies is huge high what Creek Tony and I'm going to go into it just a little case. Auto unite what many cases together. But we recently had a case last year of a fourteen year old girl who is. Running wait Pittsburg shoes one of Tony's Kelson. Twenty put in contact how mommy contact with me. And we worked this case together aye why it turns out this thirteen fourteen year old. Although she won't admit the trafficking it led to another victim which led to another victim I think at this point where now it fourteen victims. From around wait I'm hoping they get this guy very soon. Room. Meeting with nonprofits not NGOs faith based groups I'm I'm very involved in that as a lot of the other agents who thought they are huge to us there are huge resource. So we really recognize the value of all these groups. Human trafficking operations. We we try and do them. As always a manpower issue. You know we'd like to see more. Funding and resources to help us with that but we do need to do these John and. Exploiter operations and I am especially passionate about the. The purchases and we really should be going off to them I it's a preventative measure. And like the idea of ID said we need to be. You know that they need these to ninety registrations home these purchases. You we need to be getting. More prosecutions on them I have a phone in my possession from adult who was thirteen at the time. I had a search warrant written on it. I got over thirty men China by this goal on that phone. I have she looks like she's nine years old and have prostitution ads we don't have the time or the resources to go off to every number to go off to every person that was trying to buy these female. We are out in the schools and then the community I just last week trying to one of the high schools. We need to be doing more might target area for business it's my opinion it's not depend on the police department we meet need for teaching awful for fifth graders. We need to be out that educating them at that age. By high school it's too late by middle school it's almost too late my youngest victim for me has been the eleven. I we need to be talking about recognizing the signs that said early on and and that parents the parents need to be involved in this education. I have department training hard to office is a trained on human trafficking recognize the signs of human trafficking. I believe they should have more but again it's that time in a funding issue. I have we participated and. S. B. eleven ninety three and I actually have to say it was a lot of fun. I was surprised how well we received got we well we will receive from the when out to these businesses. It was section a fun afternoon I really enjoyed doing that and I know they'll be enough one coming up. We work very closely with neck mac and national Senate missing exploited children huge resource are often norm Forstmann. I'm one of things I like about the national citizens when children this they will do analysis for you. They wrote analysis on social media council on. You know possible exploit is and they they will help with that they also get the flies out for you and they keep track of data. So they are keeping a track of. The amount of. Since you know and that's why we really need to all be referring op. Children to neck neck so they can keep better statistics. That we have a wonderful program I'm not going to get its name away but law enforcement has a. Huge program. Ashton Krishna is the founder of this program and the big fan of his off that this. And if I didn't have this program I couldn't do the work that I'm doing it is huge. We need to getting this not wonderful some agencies have it and it's free. And every time I get because I have multiple agencies calling me all the time because I've what's kind got around that I. I know what I'm doing. I might wear your using this program that I know we don't know about it and I can it's free just apply for it's a huge asset so I'm trying to get the word out about everyone using. This program. We work well with probation and parole. Probation is huge in fact. Just recently I really have to equip probation the district attorney's office I had a runaway juvenile aye before she left she stole. A consumer and money from her family member. And what I wrote of petty theft case on have because I hate to say this. It was a way I knew I could get for safe. And the aye actualizado two it probation weak and per. The district has office we got the case file it and the judge. Thank you judge issued and extradite will warrant. We found her in Phoenix aye founder in Phoenix for social media if we didn't have that warrant we probably would not go ahead back to get have safe. One of the things when our full spent sorry I would note we really have to develop good relationships of the families of these. Not a white cities trafficking victims because they are help these girls often reach out to them. And they give us information and it's a it's really important to. Have a good relationship with these these families. A for the questions office varias I think. The biggest barrier is keeping the juvenile safe that's the. Biggest problem that we have in my ideal world we'd be building a home on the top of a mountain surrounded by bats coyotes the snakes. So these girls would not run because they also into the life that they do run that we need the support in the counseling in the help for them. We as we talked about we are century victimizing our children right now because we cannot detain them. Of various is then not willing to talk they've they often don't see themselves as the victim. And that's a huge problem for us I'd like to go in when I find a victim I to talk to on a Friday because I don't write uniform on Friday I got my civilian clothes to welcome Friday. And that because I'm not in a police uniform. I'm a mom I my grandma they do tend to open up a little bit. But not very often you know but it does help that time not seen as a person of law enforcement. We have the reluctance the often very reluctant to get out of the life. They. They see that exploiters that provider. And that's very hard that trauma bond that was spoken about earlier is very very hard to break. The resources needed was one of the questions funding we need funding we need more people we need more help. This is this is a giant battle that we're facing right now. A kid housing for juveniles I just spoke about that specialized housing for adult victims that's open twenty four seven that's nothing was someone. Tony and I have we had if I had this a few weeks ago we find a victim. I am the thin air space like a put who was in fact filled. You no we need some think that we can we can keep them you know low because they. But away from their exploiters. So what can the legislative do then this is just. Mike my feelings. Pacha cuts the time for suspects said Diamanti talked about that many big proponent of that let's put these guys away for a very very long time. Funding for personnel to work these cases education I spoke about that harsher sentences for the buyers I spoke about that. I really to see some kind of. Penalize ation for hotels. I just had a fourteen year old I just spoke to and she was telling me that. The exploit a was given the hotel five hundred dollars. To keep quiet. So I really think that you know we meet we nay to start going off the hotels and and and into prosecuting them for tying the blind diet such. Mandate tattoo parlors and now follow up and nail salon spear. Mandated reporters I I think you know the schools alumni had done they one that now it's done. But I think that's a great place to start especially the talk to. Pause. A jurisdiction. Right now if. But I'd I'm not a legal person I don't quite know how this works but I've just had a case of a. Spec all. And nothing happened in Contra Costa county and it was all in Alameda county so that is actually going down I spoke to he would PD in that's going down be filed next week and Hey what it. But why copy five hit. You know I mean I victims here I I'd like to see you know if it's my case. I should own it. Rob wouldn't give it to someone else. Then that's just my personal opinion but I'd like to see maybe you know at some changes that. And another thing. Is hippa I mean we kind of spoken out earlier I had a big debate with adulta. About he was telling me how he knew who these skills quirk who the trafficking victims web because. Basically he was an OBGYN and they were coming in and he was cleaning them up. And three months later they were back again I might but your mandate a report he says but that protected by hip. So I again I'm not legal I don't know how that works but it he signalman recognizing them. Out opposite doing that then maybe we need to make some changes right that. And I think that's about all I have to say. But just and is there anything else the safety corporate really. Actually no that's actually Y. one Louise to go first. Always very thorough. I'm one things I want to talk about it's been said before but. I want to reiterate it we need a multi angle approach we have take out every lake of this chair if we want to bring it down. We have to target the buyers. Stricter penalties because for people who are buying these children. Against the pimps we'd have aggressive investigation by the police officers. The more training we have the better the more we know how to do our jobs better. And then cooperation with our de is. To insure the prosecution. And also and. Certainly important I can't. Stressed enough to provide services services and to be available twenty four hours. I work nights. I don't work. I I will not be able to call services at noon and say Hey I need help with me and I'm calling it to three four o'clock in the morning. Can I have one shot to get that woman that victim off the street and get her health. I've talked survivors in the average time they've told me is they've been offer services sixteen times before they get out of a life. I have to if I have one shot I have to make it count. It have to be able to reach him twenty four seven. Big server what next week. Absolutely in thank you for your very thorough and. And corporal. Killian your expeditious. Presentation. Recall the questions were answered and. I just a going back to one thing I know if the move quickly we have another panel to to hear from. But going back to. The resources. And. We went that. Is there any kind of a way that there can be a a closer bond or. Communication with these non governmental agencies or groups that could possibly provide services whether it's Catholic charities or others. Are are local agencies. Such as police departments meeting with potential. Groups that could become resourceful to you or has a something that's yet to. Come to fruition in celebrated by police departments. We belong to at the alliance to offend and abuse coalition and we meet quarterly and prove that we have got lots of information on the family justice center. Lots of information on you know who can help us and I'm I'm very lucky Pittsburg PD that we do have a victim witness Africa who works out of our office. And I am really good friends with the. Neighborhood who is. Who does the victim witness over the more my speed dial soap we do have an issue I am able to call them because at this point I'm kind of rushing around trying to get the H. T. investigation Dodd? And I can meet with that and then they stop calling all all the groups see what help we can get fantastic in this is a perfect segue and to our next panel. Our next panel are. Service providers that we're going to be able to hear from so I would like to make that train. Transition as we enter into the latter part of our. Special. Session today. And we will invite our service providers. To come to the Dyess. And as they are. I do want a fake. Corporal Killian as well as miss Reeves for your presentation. Very thorough and it's good to hear from law enforcement. And now we're excited to hear from a service providers as they're coming and getting settled and. I will introduce them su son Kim who is the executive director for Contra Costa county family justice centers. We have mealy Bacteroidetes. Division manager of children and family services. Services quality assurance division for Contra Costa county. Benicia Johnson. With C. S. E. C. and that is commercially sexually exploited children and you are the coordinator for cops Costa county. Isa Mayes interim executive director for Missy. If she. Okay aye Aysha. Is not come in. Make it well by the way I did want to let miss leaves no. We did invite Ashton. Chris merger got of. But that he is busy today. So could not make it. And then less. The guy she. Board member for pillars of hope. Which is a great resource as well so our four panelists that we have here today. Thank you for coming and we will ask you some will you. The liberty to kick it off. Good morning. I took a Tim Grayson has as as you know really been a leader of our family justice centers in contrast the county and. I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address any. Disappoint topic and today I'm gonna try to use only ten dollars but not one dollar like got Tony did but about ten dollars that's right. Right. So I'm the executive director of the family justice center so I represent the family justice center here amylose on the executive committee for the Contra Costa times alliance to and. Human trafficking. And this coalition has been around for about. Ten years you know community. And I is started first as a project of the Contra Costa alliance ten the. And abuse which was the board of supervisors initiative that started in two thousand one to address domestic violence and child abuse. Back in two thousand one we weren't really thinking about to identify human trafficking. But a little later all around two thousand seven the coalition started. With informal activities and some organizing efforts. And in two thousand. Fourteen we've finally hired a full time coordinator so we were able to put structure. And coordination in place. And so it currently the coalition consists of about thirty members of which includes law enforcement agencies probation. Community based organizations such as Comey valid solutions. And family justice that up and a lot of organizations working together. And we have our various working committees that address of raising awareness and expanding resources for becomes. As well as. Improving capacity building follow providers. And as for as far as the family justice center IEDs once that's that a for victims of domestic violence sexual assault elder abuse child abuse and human trafficking. In two thousand seventeen we assisted three thousand four hundred families there was an increase of about twenty five percent from two thousand succeed. So the word is out there. To any victims of interpersonal violence that could come to the family justice advocate and get the health and healing they need. I in terms of human trafficking becomes aye in Alice center in two thousand seventeen about two percent of our clients who are trafficking victims. Yes it is a small number compared to the rest of us becomes but it is increasing. And is increasing because there's more awareness of our community more identification by providers and also more referrals from. Law enforcement partners so I think this collaborative approach of public private partnership you know county really has been working very well. In addition to providing. Bond services I coordination for the victim services we provide capacity the opportunities that the family justice than a. Real run a school called the family justice institute. So the insecurity is really a learning opportunity for a lot of our service providers and community members so just this morning we had we are offering human trafficking one a one. So most of our providers Dugdale at the family justice center learning about him in trafficking and they are not here for that reason. So on the day we opened this institutes registration on the first day fifty people registered so people overly hungry for that knowledge about human trafficking in our community. So we are offering another workshop in February. And again that one is sold out. So there's just a lot more interest in the topic and people are learning about that so I think that's really good news. Another thing we do it the family justice center in call partnership with the coalition is to avoid monthly my to this very team review meeting. And the key. We started that in April two thousand sixteen. And between two thousand sixteen are they put it doesn't sixteen and December two thousand seventeen we come being. Fourteen and the team meetings participated by fifteen to twenty different partners so that includes a district attorney's office. Concord police which were police probation on nonprofit providers and a lot of different different professionals anywhere between fifteen to twenty partners coming together once a month. To discuss the most complex and difficult human trafficking cases. So if we want to look at this case is the fourteen case a fifteen cases that we would review together. Or victims were female. To what goal sex trafficking cases. One was at the old labor trafficking case and twelve cases involve children drug trafficking victims. That kind of goes to show you how in our community we were the. Up prioritize child trafficking becomes. If you ask this victims what their needs are and we asked them. I guess can you guess number one need. Housing. The second was education they wanted to go back to school and Lauren and we found that there were barriers with these two going to get back to school and a lot. Third I mental health services. Fourth legal services and fifth need was jobs so this five things basic things that we or enjoy and our human trafficking become source identified as their top needs. In addition to. Up providing the services for human trafficking becomes our and the team meetings provided learning opportunities for all members food at all professionals became what capable. Of. Handling human trafficking cases. I want to just briefly talk about barriers that I want to spend too much time about it because that there we are talk about. The lack of housing the for sure. As they can use I think. We are not quite quite identifying male victims of UN traffic we are not as good at that so we need more education are on that and we need more commitment to the identifying male becomes. And also labor trafficking I think we are definitely not. As good about identify labor choppy becomes and providing services to them. Princess. The coalition are has produced the reports I'm gonna leave this to use him so you could read them in your spare time. So the coalition's report also identifies some of the cases that we worked on as a coalition of oda partners. And in a in Contra Costa county the coalition members. Provided services to five hundred victims between two thousand fourteen and two thousand seventeen. And ninety percent of those victims will women. And also labor chucking it was about ten percent. We believe that their much labor trafficking cases out there we just are not addressing them adequately someone I give you this reports. Up in terms of the additional resources that we need. I wanna go back to more training and resources for labor trafficking. And then one of collaboration across sectors and departments and different. Sectors I think up Nancy o'malley Maienschein. systems I think that's really important. I also like the idea of how to Palos. A when I was sitting here today actually I got an email from. Someone with them mount Diablo school district and I was like how timely I too got this email. What they're saying is? Mount double unified school district has been struggling with so many young girls and boys who are being sexually exploited. Then or at high risk the day identified that and they wanna do something about it in the school district and they've reached out to us the family justice center and the coalition. To work together you know we have this collaboration opportunities that I would be point so I went over to talk about that expanding those resources to improve collaboration. Among different sectors through that we've done work in silos. And then I just wanna also mentioned that. We need to look up pay attention to immigrant communities a marginalized communities I mean especially with labor trafficking an increase language access and cultural competency normal all of our partners and agencies who service becomes. Well you know that in Contra Costa county we have about four hundred fifteen new refugees. That is each year. There from Afghanistan so I just learned this last year. So what are we doing about these community so just to pay attention to marginalized communities. In terms of your support him. Everyone is going to be more money but I'm not going to say that. No I would just say that you know we definitely need to. Do while I in the area of labor trafficking. We need. More investments inflexible housing options but becomes and finally. We need more investment in prevention education we gotta go back to elementary school we gotta start now much school there's so much that needs to be done. Thank you. That I spent ten dollars you spend ten dollars. That is actually thank you so much for your presentation we will move right on to our next president aye presenter. Neely macaroni. Thank you I think you chairman Greenspan and all the panelists who spoken today so eloquently about the needs of our human trafficking victims. I don't feel like I need to spend that much time even going over all of the. Different areas that I could have potentially done because the palace have been so thorough in their comments. And one of the things I wanted states it's actually very inspiring and heart warming to know that. There's so much expertise out there because when you're doing this work it feels very. Overwhelming and it feels like. We're not gonna make any difference so it felt really good to me to hear how much. Expertise is out there and obviously the expertise leads us to what more is needed but at least were were more aware of what that challenges our. I'm a division manager with children and family services in Contra Costa county. And. For the last several years I've been tasked with implementing the cease act program which is commercially sexually exploited children program. In our county which went into effect in two thousand fifteen with the passage of SB eight fifty five. S. B. fit a fifty five clarified that. Children who've been exploited could be served by the child welfare system although we had always been in. Working with youth who been. Traffic or had been exploited it clarified that the children are actually victims and as such should be reported to our child abuse prevention hotline so one of the things that S. B. eight fifty five did it clarified that all. Suspicion of exploitation and trafficking whether or not the parent was aware or did something to I'm contributed exploitation it should still be reported to our hotline and that we were also tasked with cross reporting back to law enforcement. So those were some of the changes that that legislature. A courage my comments today are going to address the issues facing our counties human trafficking coalition pursue son covered a lot of that. So I'm gonna focus more specifically on some of the challenges that face youth and families who are served or on coming contact with the child welfare system. We do participate from the very beginning when I got involved with. This work I partner with the human trafficking coalition because. It's up such complex work on any. It they require such capacity in the community that it made more sense to be involved with the greater counties. Activities so that we could leverage our resources leverage our expertise and be more aware of what is out there what the gaps are. Through the legislation as I mentioned we're tasked with the requirement to identify. And track in our child welfare database. It's that's a statewide system. You that have been. Traffic it's either before coming into foster care after being in foster care and also tracking those who are at risk so a lot of our efforts are around training our social workers and our community partners. Around identification. We also serve. Youth and families we provide case management we provide place that resources if they come into foster care. And we also provide service linkage to our community partners we don't specifically provides a mental services but we work with our kids. County mental health or community based organizations to ensure that families you get. Link dot and then one of our primary goals is obviously we unification R. permanency for you. Making sure that they're able to move back home to a safe home or and to some other permanent situation. I'm one of the areas that limits our ability to serve these. Victims is actually they use receptive eighty to services. As many of us learned through training that there's aye stages of change that occur for. For anyone who's going through any challenge in their life and a lot of that you that we had. Come across are just not even aware were ready to make a change and so how that manifests is that they're often. Be very difficult to work with. They're teenagers on there are resistant to aye acknowledging that there's a problem they run away a lot the. They coming go it's very challenging and it's very frustrating for those that want to help that we all want to go out and rescue these. Victims but the reality is they have to have some willingness to change or receive the. Of the assistance and then of course as a child welfare agency and also for. Approach our probation partners who are charged with making up placement into foster care within challenged with them coming and going out of foster care. Taking use with them out back on to the streets getting exploited and foster care. And just that challenge of. Of care givers whether it's relatives or foster homes or a larger facilities. Group homes having the. The ability and willingness to deal with layers of trauma. On the youth that are coming to us. It's no it's no accident that they're being exploited these are usually I use that have been abused as young children weather was severely lacks. Physical abuse sexual abuse their coming with layers and layers and layers of trauma exposure to violence in their communities are their homes so it's not. Easy to take these youth into your home and for those of you like myself who have teenagers. It's just not even easy they're teenagers they're putting up. Up beside and I shall a way of being they want to be. Adults in some ways so it just makes it really challenging to work with them. At another barrier for child welfare for probation a particular who do try to make placements into the facilities that we have in California. Is that. The regulations that. We. We are. Passed with where we're governed by the state by federal ready regulation state regulations and it makes it difficult for us to navigate a system. And is to make placements into foster care our server use when we have to. Among or working with our juvenile courts all the youth have attorneys families have attorneys. And it's just makes it complicated it's not as simple as just placing a youth in a home in a. Rural area and just letting it go it's it's very calm. Complicated is really hard to juggle when you're managing so many other. Caseload. Demands other initiatives are coming down or new changes in law that our staff have to deal with. Some of the resources that we've identified include like I said placer resources. The ability to and the willingness to serve teenagers are young. Young young children. And how that specialty we there is training out there now from on the community colleges who. Provide curriculum for caregivers but it's not mandated it. Mandated that the community colleges provide that for our child welfare families but they're not. Foster families but they're not required to go because there's so many other reasons. Other training that they need to do so training on identification. And. Just out like I had said earlier just being able to emotionally deal with the layers of trauma and the fact that you were opening your home. To potential violence and. If especially if exploiters are still out there. We have and the. Youth and foster care are. Allowed to have a set of personal rights which were very important and those personal rights though sometimes conflict with our desire to keep them safe so often they're. Able to have cell phones we can't take cellphones away and that's obviously. As Louise pointed out social media as a is a huge way that they're getting. Contacted or exploited or recruited of what have you so we we have some challenges I know there's reform going on in our system but it's it's it's hard to balance both. The other thing that I think that. We've identified in this is been something for a long time and manage the. Art hotline for many years and I'm the the social workers that manage hotline when I would ask them what is the biggest thing that you're seeing. You know need that you see out there and it's resources and support for families with teenagers with adolescents and I think that that was even before we identify that that see sec was occurring at such a volume. But really these are families were struggling with young adults with their teenagers and there's nothing in the community toward them. You're limited by what health insurance you have. And that may or may not be holistic enough. So resources around if you're just someone in the community you need help parenting your team. What's out there in the community and. Being able to serve them and then once they do become clients of child welfare. It it is still just as challenging to find resources to serve them. So finally I just want to encourage the legislature to trust that the greater societal issue of child sexual abuse and. Happy that other isn't mentioned this. We really need to get at the heart of why it's okay for adults to have sex with children every that's a societal issue that's not something that's how welfare can solve we're basically. Up receiving kids who've Bates who. You know have had years of neglect and abuse and it cut it starts with some fundamental issues that. We're not dealing with in our society which is why is that okay. Why is that okay and so one of the things I would encourage is we have partners around the state who do child abuse prevention? Education and that's our child abuse prevention councils their woefully. Under under funded. But there are like our own child abuse prevention council is out there doing curriculum and and school districts they've been views some of the trafficking information in there. But they're they they need more resources to expand into dedicated curriculum for school districts and I'm sure other on child abuse prevention councils with it well. Thank you very much. Thank you so very much for your presentation. And we will move on to Benicia Johnson and. Get away. There was. Thank you chairman Grayson and everyone for being here. I have aye specific role I work primarily with. Children who've been sexually exploited within the county so I've only been here a few months so in so many ways I think and stone the preparation phase. So hopefully. I'm able to articulate myself while as my boss sits next to me. Thank you for that. I think my role has always been a little bit different I. I came introduced to sexual exploited kids when I was twenty years old. And my first clients in liberty city Miami Y. has an eighth grade. Young man who was selling and himself at night and he would show out only on the days that we had out there. And he would talk to me about those experiences so at that time there were that dilutes the lingo wasn't even around and the support wasn't there all the asked me to do was to just meet with him and talk about his feelings and. That was that so we've come a long way from that point to actually having resources and support. And so my arms testimony I guess today is really to talk about some of the services and that. Contra Costa county is providing and some of the challenges without but also our commitment to it and so it's. Part of our role is to identify all children that are at risk or currently being exploited so it's not just that you have been exploiting want to know that if there's a possibility that you will be. And we want to intervene to make sure that we prevent. It continuing another part of that is once we've identified in were working with you we want to make sure that we're giving you the best supports. Because the problem with the trauma that they've experienced is yes you've come in with the support and you're there with this is a life long. Challenge that they will happen trauma and stays with you and so I won't necessarily get into trauma one a one but it's not I always feel with the visual sense. It's most people experience trauma they once a blink and have it go away. Kind of like the rain. It rains today and tomorrow the sun comes out and people may ninety remember that it rainy. That is not the same far trauma victims and so one of the things that's a lot of that Contra Costa county dies is we're able to. Get it immediately so we do have their community violent solution we do have a twenty four seven lie crisis line that people can call. And someone will go out and meet with this you. Some of the barriers with that is who knows about it. So that's part of my job is to make sure that everyone is aware that leases aware that the other police officers when they're out are where everyone needs to know that that service exists. The other components is making sure that people not is a drop in center. In Richmond. I am so we're getting that information out making sure that the social workers know that the laws have changed a lot of it is the information as things change we have to get out. And how we get it out a lot of times we write things down. We get brochures we get emails and I'm since people don't read it. But people watch commercials. People love to see media they like to see things in front of them that are flashing in moving. And so that's also part of our strategies that use different ways of communicating. Right because a lot of times how many vets get business cards wood business cards you sometimes you look at them any put away. And you're like all I remember I did speak to someone about that we get no idea where it it. Has a part of our strategy is also having our information on a website. If you can't get me on the phone you know exactly where to go to get that the concept that is needed. The other parts as far as barriers I think I don't need to get into what more the barriers are. Aye deftly feel that. When we're out looking into giving information. Sometimes we get the same And so that becomes a barrier so if. Certain people come that only certain people know. Everyone needs to know. Every whether you have children or not. Because everyone weekends are actually each other in different ways we all catch the part we all see the five we all go to the mall well good grocery stores. Were all interacting with each other so there's no need for only one demographic to go everyone needs sit out and that's part of our role is to spread the word. The great thing about cuts across the county is working in a collaborative effort. We're not alone. Should never feel like you're alone in this fight there's so many resources that you can connect with and if there's a resource doesn't exist. That we can collaborate to create. And so that's one thing that's really great about us working with the steering committee. Working with RC sack team to make sure that we're prepared making brain awareness week doing prevention right down to find our children. And we're providing the resources that they need. I think that's all I need to to say about. Working with. The children and. Cuts across the county. Thank you so much for your energy passion hope. That you have in your presentation S. Johnson and we now will go to our final presenter. Today and that is less Higashi. But that is pillars of hope. My can throw away probably ninety five. Percent of what I was gonna say because it would said everything so well. And thank you so much a assembly member Grayson for inviting us here for inviting me here. As a father as a grandfather in as a volunteer in despite. Does something that I'm very very passionate about. I'm of. I am very encouraged but out but I'm here today. I've learned a lot even though I've I've had no I've gathered a lot of information in the fight. One of the things that I do is I I volunteer for. A. Home because colors of hope. There were a very very small nonprofit. We struggle everyday to make our bills we struggle every to give hope and restoration two girls that have been. Better survived human trafficking. And one of the things that we do is we. Give them not only a home environment but we get them a loving home environment. Something that they haven't had in a very very long time whether they grew up in a very very abusive family or whether they grew up in an abusive situation. And of course being exploited that was very very violent abusive as well. And. It's very difficult as eight organization. Such as ours to do the things that we need to do because one of our barriers is of course is money. And we've all talked about money and we work with a wonderful wonderful NGOs if you ever. Have a chance to volunteer for an NGO ninety and I encourage you in this field. To volunteer to to spend a couple days to do. Whatever you need to do because you can see a passion gonna see a calling on the people's lives to do this fight. And one of the things is that. It is to get. For for media personally is that I feel that I need to be I need to get people as passionate about it as I am. Against this fight because every day every minute someone is being exploited somebody's daughter is being exploited. And so as pillars will we like to do is we like to get that child we'd like to get the or what we're up face to right now. I would like to be a phase one where we get sea sick kids. That's a long way down the down the road. But right now we're face to we have a we have adult women eighteen and over. And. What we want to do is we want to give them a holistic? Care we want to give them their dental their medical accounts lean education. Job training. And that that I'm quickly costs money. And it's very very expensive it's not the it's not something that we can just do it a couple dollars we need a lot of money. So in that in that. That. One of our main things we do is we do a lot fund raising. That is one of our main focuses and I feel that that's one of the things that we know that we have to do it. But is something that takes away time and energy. Helping these women. In helping these kids the other thing we've addresses well is is you know I I don't know of any any houses that. That. That houses voice that had been exploited across the United States I think. I heard of one maybe there's two now I am not sure. But that something as a County at the we need to address as well. Is I know that there's I've I've spoken to people spoken demand that it had that been. Exploiters exploited themselves to survive in the streets as a run away running from adobe's situation. Pillars is is world fairly young. Organization still learning every day every every. Every person that we come in we we just start taking people and. How women and survivors in the last year? So it's been a learning experience for us and them even though we. We fully prepared to to take on this task everyday it's it it's new it's a new challenge for us. So we would love to work with. Other organizations in collaboration and down and be able to. Make ourselves aware to use what we provide. To the agencies and what we can do and what and and and I don't see what you guys can do with us. And to to collaborate so maybe that some of the costs that we have. Maybe that can be. Taken up by another agency as well. And I think that if we can streamline and we come together as organizations both. A governmental law enforcement and NGOs and we can do something that we're not being so redundant. In our in our task for that same person or the scene. Same out victim. Survivor that would be something that we can do as well. The other. Thing I'd like to speak on is that and we spoke on and what can we do better. And I think one of things we can do better. And this something that's also and very very passion about. Is that I go to a lot of. Human trafficking anti human trafficking things. And I am. Sadly to say. The meetings are with. Mostly women. Very few men. So men. We are absent in the fight but we're we're ninety per eight percent of the demand. Something wrong with that. Why don't we their? When we their in the fight. We are the demand side. The reason why these organizations exist is because men. By women and children. That is the only reason why we are even talking about this. This something that we need to address as men. And and we need to talk or boys about as well. Boys these days they say are exposed to hard core* at the age of eight. There's something wrong with that picture. I am lucky to also. Be involved with Alameda district attorney's office on. On. And he project. What we address the demand side but it's a very small fight right now? Let's not keep on fighting this thing downstream let's fight upstream. So. I had I hope I've made myself clear. Aye I love. The fact that. That I get to speak on this issue. I love the fact that them I meeting new people on the flight. Idea I thank you for your time. I thank you for the panels that spoken I've I've enjoyed every. And I've learned quite a bit from you guys so thank you very much Mister Gatti thank you for your strong call and passion in your presentation. Unless the panel if you just if you don't mind staying up here for the last couple of minutes. We are going to and I want to thank the panel as who sent him for your presentation as well as miss McElroy miss Johnson and Mr Akashi. As provider service providers we have just a couple more minutes here and I wanted to open up the opportunity. To in this session with public comment are are there any folks or anyone here. That would like to come and make public comment. Seeing none then. Or do I. Okay will come forward there's a podium right over here. Public comment NDEs. About two minutes for each speaker so if you have a comment you have about two minutes. Please. Yeah I just like to comment about one thing. You have all these people that are being sent up for trafficking. He's been in the papers left and right. But what I like to know is. Why in the world are these people get enough with the deals? Every time you turn around. It's a plea deal. A plea deal to where. Okay. Well his name is senior again. Why is it taking care of the first time? Why isn't just cut? To where. Hey. He's gone out. And he's trafficking these. Women. Underage girls. And he gets a free deal. He does go to prison. But he's gonna be out maybe ten years. Maybe seven years. Why is he put away for life? I don't understand that. It goes over and over and over. They had one guy and you're that. From Lafayette. I mean it took you repeat this corpus to finally find out what he was up to. It took over ten years. I don't understand it. It's not so much on the streets. But through the court system. And that is where we're having problems. And if anything else like we've done our right with marijuana we may that to where. You can buy for bags and. Whatever. But the thing is is wears is going to stop. Why can't we get something out there to where? Okay. You're gonna put for twenty five years. Obviously. It's not happening. Because these people. Get back on the streets. And they do what they did before. And it doesn't make any sense to me. Thank you. Thank you very come and if you don't mind just stating your name for just for the record. John doors said Concord California. One of our constituents and assembly district fourteen. Any other public comments please. Simply state your name and. My name's Kanyon them thank.

And and there is many. I know other organizations I've been part of pillars of hope in the past and. I'm really actually anxious to.
