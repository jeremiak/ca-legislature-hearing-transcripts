FINALLY WE WILL BE ACCEPTING WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THROUGH THE SUB ONE EMAIL ACCOUNT. AND THE ADDRESS IS BUDGET SUB ONE AT ASM DOT CA DOT GOV. A FEW BRIEF OPENING COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN. THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THAT THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORMS. IT IS CLEAR TO ME AND NO DOUBT TOO MANY OF US THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THIS IS TRUE FOR SOME ASPECTS OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM MORE THAN OTHERS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR NURSING HOME CARE. IT'S HIGH TIME AND LONG OVERDUE THAT WE TAKE THE CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF LABOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO IGNORE THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY OR THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION OF PATIENTS. BUT BEFORE WE DIG INTO THE DETAILS ON NURSING HOMES WE'LL START WITH THE DISCUSSION ON CAL EIGHTEEN WHICH IS THE STATE'S INSPIRING EFFORTS TO END THE STATUS QUO FOR MUCH OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. CAL AIM AT LAST SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE FRAGMENTATION THE INEFFICIENCIES AND THE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE MEDICARE PROGRAM FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND WHILE CAL AIM SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT APPROACH OVERALL IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE. FOR ENSURING THAT CAL AIM DOES IN FACT LIVE UP TO ITS PROMISE. WITH THAT LET US BEGIN. HER FIRST PANEL TODAY WILL BE ON ISSUE ONE COVERING CAL AIM WE WILL HAVE THREE PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL DIRECTOR MICHELLE BOSS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES J. C. COOPER WHO IS OUR STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR AND SANDRA SIGNS WHO IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOR SOLANO COUNTY. ALTHOUGH LISTED ON THE AGENDA DR RYAN QUEST WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS BEEN PULLED AWAY BY JURY DUTY. LET US PLEASE BEGIN WITH DIRECTOR BOSS. THIS IS JC COOPER ACTUALLY I'M DO MOST OF OUR COMMENTS TODAY IN A DIRECTOR POSSIBLE BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS LATER ON IN APPRECIATE THE OPENING COMMENTS. I'M IN REGARDS TO LEVEL SETTING YOU KNOW HOW LAME IS BEING EXTREMELY ASPIRATIONAL AND IN A HUGE UP HE'S BIRTH ALL TO WORK COLLECTIVELY TO IN OTHER DEPARTMENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE POLICY PIECES I THINK OVERALL CALLIE MS MOVING MEDICARE TOWARDS A POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH THAT REALLY PRIORITIZES PREVENTION AND WHOLE PERSON CARE APPROACHES. THE VISION IS TO REALLY MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND LYFT ADDRESS SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH AND BREAK DOWN THE WALLS OF HEALTH CARE. HOW HE WILL OFFER MEDICARE ENROLLEES COORDINATED AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AT THAT ADDRESS THEIR PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENTAL DENTAL AND LONG TERM CARE NEEDS. KELLY REALLY ALIGNS ALL ELEMENTS OF MEDIC CAL INTO A SYSTEM THAT IS STANDARDIZED SIMPLIFIED IN FOCUSED ON. HELPING ENROLLEES LIVE. BE HEALTHIER I SUCCESS REQUIRE THE END. INSIST COME OF A- NETWORK OF PARTNER. INCLUDING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDERS COUNTIES THE END COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THIS IS NOT SOMETHING JUST ONE OF US CAN DO WE ARE COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL. IDES WAS VERY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR- THE FEDERAL APPROVAL OF OUR PEERS WEAVERS IN TELLING KEY INITIATIVES. THEIR SUPPORT IS INSTRUMENTAL IN REGARDS TO US BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. ON AS WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT OR WHAT WE CALL ECM- IN PHASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES THAT PREVIOUSLY SERVED WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND OR HEALTH PROBLEMS MEMBERS I WENT LIVE- APPROXIMATELY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WERE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION INTO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT. THE NEXT IMPLEMENTATION BELIEVES IS ON JANUARY FIRST OUR JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. A POPULATIONS OF FOCUS INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HOW TO UTILIZE OUR ADULTS AND ADULTS. WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THREE TWENTY TWENTY D. FOURTH. AND HE YOUR MAN TO- SEPARATE ADDITION. COPULATIONS OF FOCUS- INTO THREE WALL JANUARY OF TWENTY THREE INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING FROM INCARCERATION TO THE COMMUNITY. I'M MEMBERS ELIGIBLE FOR LONG TERM CARE OR AT RISK OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND NURSING HOME RESIDENTS TRANSITIONING TO THE COMMUNITY. COME JULY ONE OF TWENTY THREE WE WILL ALSO FOCUS ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH. EASING OF ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT WAS CRITICAL AND REALLY WAS DONE BASED ON EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS TYPE OF CHANGE HAPPENED OVER TIME WE NEEDED TO EXIT OUT THE PLANS AND PROVIDERS CAN FOCUS ON KEY POPULATIONS AS THEY BUILD THEIR NETWORKS. BUILD THEIR RELATIONSHIPS AND BUILD CHANGE AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL TO HAPPEN OVER TIME. EACH THE ALSO PARTNER WITH PLANS IMPROVE TO. LAUNCHED SUPPORTS GNU ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M WE HAVE ADOPTED AND ARE PROVIDED A LIST OF FOURTEEN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. IN JANUARY TWENTY FIVE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES BEGAN OFFERING MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY COMMUNITY SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS TRANSITION TO COMMUNITY SUPPORTS FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND WHILE COMMUNITY SUPPORT ALL ARE VOLUNTARY FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO OFFER BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO NEARLY ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN ALL COUNTIES WERE WILL OFFER SOME LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. ON AVERAGE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE ELECTED TO INITIALLY FOCUS ON OFFERING FIVE TO SIX COMMUNITIES THE COURTS IN EACH COUNTY. I WITH MOST PLANS STARTING WITH HOUSING RELATED SERVICES MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS AND ASK THE REMEDIATION. OUR TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR COMMUNITY SUPPORT ELECTIONS. DH CS HAS POSTED THE LIST OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BY MANAGED CARE PLANNING COUNTY ON ITS WEBSITE FOR FULL TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS. REGARDING THE OTHER KALYAN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORMS DHT HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE. AS TO UP THE CRITERIA FOR ACCESS TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD INCLUDING THE FOR A DIAGNOSIS IS MADE AND ESTABLISHES SEVERAL CRITERIA FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. TO ACCESS SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR VIRTUE OF BEING A HIGH RISK UPPER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER DO YOU TO EXPERIENCE OF TRAUMA. IN ADDITION THE ACS IS IMPLEMENTING A DOCUMENTATION REFORM POLICY THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO JUST STREAMLINED AND STANDARDIZED CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ACROSS SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH DRUG MEDI CAL IN DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEMS. FINALLY DCS IS DEVELOPING GUIDANCE TO IMPLEMENT THE WROTE NO WRONG DOOR POLICIES THAT WILL ALSO BECOME EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES REGARDLESS OF THE DELIVERYSYSTEM WHERE THEY ARE SEEKING CARE. I'M TO GET SOME UPDATES IN REGARDS TO YOU SOME OF THE PLANNING PHASES FOR THE LONG TERM CARE A BENEFIT. FOR PLANS TO CURRENTLY COVER LONG TERM CARE IF THEY'RE NOT TO GET A AFFECTED JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON DEC HAS HAS BEEN CONVENING A LARGE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND THAT INCLUDES DISTANCE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS A DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES JUSTICE IN AGING AND OTHER KEY PARTNERS- THIS WORKGROUP THAT CAN BEAT. HELP INFORM THE OVERALL IMPLEMENTATION IT TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON MEMBER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY COMMUNICATIONS DATA SHARING NEEDS FACILITY OVERSIGHT NEEDS AND NETWORK ADEQUACY. THE GOAL OF THE WORKGROUP IS TO CREATE A RECOMMENDATIONS BY MANY OF THIS YEAR I WISH DH YES WILL CONSIDER FOR THE FINAL POLICY IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE VERY LARGE. MOVEMENTS COMING NEXT YEAR. WE ARE ALSO READ OUR OUR ARE BEHAVIOR HEALTH REFORM WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON SCHEDULED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN JULY OF TWENTY THREE. I REMEMBER BIRDS ARE BROKEN INTO A VARIETY OF COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDED THEIR TRANSITION TO A NEW CODING SYSTEM ACROSS ALL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITHIN MEDIC. TRANSITIONING IN DEVELOPMENT OF I. G. T. PROCESS WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND THEN OF COURSE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW SCHEDULE FOR ALL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES IN OUR PROGRAM. IN REGARDS TO THE INTERSECTION WITH SACRAMENTO AND SOLANO COUNTIES D. H. THAT HAS ENGAGE SACRAMENTO SOLANO AND KAISER IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION FOR BENEFICIARIES SERVED IN THESE COUNTIES. AS A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO. POSTPONE THE TRANSITION DATE FROM JULY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO JULY ONE AT TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO ALIGN THE START DATE WITH KELLY'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORM INITIATIVES. THIS DELAY WILL ALLOW THE COUNTIES IF THEY SO CHOOSE THE CONTRACT BACK WITH KAISER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES IN THE COUNTY THIS WAS THE REQUEST MADE BY THE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. IN THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED THAT FLEXIBILITY WAS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. CONSIDERING THE RELEASE OF THE FIRST TELLING PROPOSAL IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR AND A HALF DELAYED TO JULY ONE OF TWENTY THREE. DH CS BELIEVES THAT SACRAMENTO SOLANO AND KAISER THAT HAD TO BE ABLE TIME TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION OF BENEFICIARIES. D. H. U. S. WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS NEEDED. ADDITIONALLY DO YOU YES NO IT'S A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT HAVE YOU GOTTEN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE REALIGNMENT REVENUES INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA. PURSUANT TO STATE STATUTE THE ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPED THE REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IN CONJUNCTION WITH COUNTY PARTNERS. THAT IS BASED ON THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IN ANNUAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES IN EACH COUNTY BECAUSE SACRAMENTO AND SOLANO COUNTIES DID NOT PAY FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED TO KAISER BENEFICIARIES IN MY COUNTY. THOSE COSTS WERE NOT CAPTURED IN THE REALIGNMENT ALLOCATIONS DH CS NOTES THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FALLS WITHIN THE COUNTY'S REALIGNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. KAISER RECEIVED PAYMENT FOR THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SACRAMENTO IN SOLANO COUNTY AS A PART OF THEIR CAPITATION PAYMENTS. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS MADE. TO KAISER FOR THESE SERVICES. IT ESTIMATES THE END TO COUNTY YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO RAISE IS A- FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION IT'S MILLION IN SOLANO. AS PART OF THIS TRANSITION THESE COSTS WOULD NO LONGER BE INCLUDED IN KAISER'S CAPITATION PAYMENTS. NOW WANTED TO KIND OF CONCLUDE COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THREE QUESTIONS AROUND HOW WILL MEASURE CALLIN SUCCESS. A DH CS WILL MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF TELLING IN SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING TRACKING PERFORMANCE RATES ON A CORE SET OF MEASURES ASSESSING WHETHER MEASURE SO A DECREASE IN HEALTH DISPARITIES WHETHER ACCESS AND PERFORMANCE RATES IMPROVED OVER THE LIFETIME OF KELLY. WELL IF HE DID AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF MEMBER EXPERIENCE SURVEYS TRACKING OUTCOMES FOR STATEWIDE CALLIE RELATED INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND WHETHER PLANTS AND COUNTIES ARE REACHING PARTICULAR MILESTONES RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION. IN ADDITION AS A PART OF THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN CAROLINE WEAVER EVALUATION THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTRACT OUR CONTRACT WITH AN OUTSIDE EVALUATOR TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL EVALUATION WHICH WILL BE DUE TO CMS IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. N. S. AT THE END OVERALL EVALUATION WHICH WOULD BE DO YOU TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. DH CS WILL SUBMIT AN EVALUATION PLAN TO CMS IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR THAT WHAT OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF THOSE EVALUATIONS AND HOW WILL WE EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF QALINGE IN THE COMING YEARS. THE EVALUATION WILL OUTLINE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF TELLING INITIATIVES ARE IN RALEIGH ACCESS QUALITY OF CARE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH DISPARITIES IN ADVANCEMENT OF HEALTH EQUITY. INCLUDING B. INITIATION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH TREATMENT REDUCTIONS IN INAPPROPRIATE MERGES YOU DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION AND REDUCTIONS IN INAPPROPRIATE INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION ACROSS MANY DELIVERY SYSTEM BUT ALSO SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO- INTERSECTION WITH THEIR DNC ODS PROGRAM. I THANK GOODNESS OF THE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT BENEFITS PROVIDED TO QUALIFYING AND ROWLEY'S INCREASE ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS THROUGH ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND IMPROVED. ACCESS AND UTILISE ASIAN AB HELPED SERVICE. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL ASSIST WITH THE- FUNDING HI TO THESE INITIATIVE. HELPED OUT COMES REDUCE IN A PER. UTILIZATION UTILIZATION REDUCTION AND IMPATIENT A LONG TERM UTILIZATION WILL ALSO BE TIED DIRECTLY TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE COST EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF OUR BENEFICIARIES. ADDITIONALLY AS A PART OF THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WEBER DH CS WILL BE CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS ASSESSMENT ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS MANAGED CARE DENTAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. DHS WILL MONITOR AND EVALUATE VARIOUS CALLUM INITIATIVES USING THE CRITERIA OF IMPROVING HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE MEMBER EXPERIENCE ACCESS UTILIZATION AND QUALITY. DTS IS A LIST OF RELEVANT MEASURES AND INITIATIVES REGARDING THE MONITORING AND EVALUATION AND THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND. HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. NEXT NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SANDRA- SINCE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOLANO COUNTY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU- FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M SANDRA SINCE I'M THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR SOLANO COUNTY TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF SOLANO COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND- THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF THE KAISER SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. CARE TO THE COUNTIES IN THE IN SACRAMENTO AND SOLANO AND AS MENTIONED- BY J. C. JC COOPER JUST A MOMENT AGO. AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE ALIGNMENT OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARVE OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE SUPPORT DH CS SAYS GOAL THE STANDARDIZED SPECIALTY BENEFITS ACROSS COUNTY THEN AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED TO SERVE THIS POPULATION WITH A SEVERE AND SPECIALIZED NEEDS. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TIMING. ON BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEGIN ACTUAL PLANNING WITHOUT IMPORTANT DETAILS REGARDING BOTH COMMITMENT OF FUNDING AND DETAILS OF THE CLIENT POPULATION. THE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ONLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AGREED WITH AT UP WITH DTS AND KAISER UPON A PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS. THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE. IMPACTED BY THE TRANSFER AND THAT NUMBER IS FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX INDIVIDUALS IN SACRAMENTO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETY ONE AND SOLANO. AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OF THE TRANSFER OF CARE POTENTIALLY SEVEN THOUSAND CLIENTS. AND FOR ON. BASED UPON THIS PARTICULAR AT THE MET THIS WOULD REQUIRE FOR SACRAMENTO AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR SERVICES AND FOR SOLANO COUNTY AN ADDITIONAL. SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SERVICES. ONLY AFTER COMMITTING OF FUNDING COULD BE BEGIN PLANNING- AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXTENDED NETWORK AND THAT IN CAN IN A IN A COUNTY WOULD TAKE. I ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS THE TIME IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THIS IS TREMENDOUS SYSTEM BUILD OUT AND IN SOLANO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IF THE ESTIMATES PROVE ACCURATE HI THERE IS A VERY LARGE MEDICAL FOOTPRINT AND THIS WOULD BE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED BY. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH- AND FOR BOTH COUNTY IS THE SPRING CARE TO INCLUDE **** UP YOUR A PROCUREMENT PROCESS ARE PEAS CONTRACTING DEVELOPING SITES HIRING ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE NEED TO OCCUR TO CREATE AN ACCEPTABLE NOT WORK BEFORE WE COULD BEGIN TRANSFER OF ANY CLIENTS- I'M AND ONE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT HIRING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IS VERY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW. AND SOLANO COUNTY HAS HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF- POSTING OUR OF PEAS AND HAVING NO INTERESTED BIDDERS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES THAT NEED TO FOLLOW TO PLACE AN ORDER FOR IT THIS. TRANSCRIPT HERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. ADDITIONALLY AND THE PLANNING REQUIRES IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE REGARDING THE KAISER CLIENTS SUCH AS- INFORMATION REGARDING THE AGES OF THE CLIENTS THEIR DIAGNOSES AND EVEN THE CITIES WHERE THEY LIVE SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE AND FOR WHOM SERVICES. NEED TO BE DEVELOPED AND EXPANDED. SO ONLY APPLY AND ONLY ONCE ALL THAT HAPPENS COULD BE BEGIN TRANSFERRING CLIENTS. ON AND AT THAT POINT WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND I'M- HAVING A MONTHLY CAP- NO MORE THAN 10% OF THE ANNUAL PLAN TRANSFERRING IN ANY GIVEN MONTH- THE- MS COOPER MENTIONED EARLIER THAT- THAT THERE ARE FUNDS- THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPITATED RATE THAT'S BEEN PAID TO KAISER. AND IN SERVING THIS POPULATION AND SO WE DO BELIEVE IT'S REASONABLE IF THE STATE WOULD TRANSFERRED THESE SERVICES AND IN TRANSFERRING THOSE SERVICES WOULD TRANSFER THE FUNDS. I TO THE TO THE RECEIVING HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS THE WHICH ARE THE TWO COUNTIES- WE DO NOT LEAVE ANY MEDIC CAL PLAN BUT AGREED TO CARE FOR THOUSANDS MORE BENEFICIARIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING AND- TIME TO TRANSITION OF THE OP ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE STATE WAS TO TRY TO GET A RECALCULATION OF REALIGNMENT DOLLARS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ALL COUNTIES AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO WE DON'T THINK OTHER COUNTIES- THAT ARE ALREADY STRETCHED IN THE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS SHOULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NEEDS OF OUR TWO COUNTIES. WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE INCLUDED- SOME GROWTH FOR OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND REALIGNMENT. BUT ALSO NOTE THAT AT THE SAME TIME- THAT THIS OCCURRED THE STATE IS PROPOSING SEPARATE RECRUITMENT- WHICH IS EQUIPPED WHICH ARE EQUIVALENT TO THREE TIMES. ANY POTENTIAL GROWTH THAT WE WILL SEE. CONDITIONALLY BECAUSE THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS MULTI FACTORED- WE SUGGEST- IN A REPORTING TO THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEES AND BUDGET COMMITTEES FROM BOTH DH CS IN THE COUNTIES ON THE STATUS OF THE TRANSITION AND ACHIEVEMENT OF KEY MILESTONES FOR IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN CLOSING AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN SOLANO COUNTY BOTH SEEK INTENTIONAL TIME AND SPECIFICALLY GUARANTEED FUNDING. INCLUDING ONGOING AT INCREASES FOR INFLATION AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS. IN ORDER TO. ACT ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR AN DEVELOPER SYSTEMS AND HUMANELY TRANSFER ON THIS LARGE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS. ABSENT ANY ABSENT ACTION TO ENSURE A SAFE TRANSITION. BOTH THE KAISER MEMBERS AND THOSE CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLAS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL WANT TO AVOID. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IS THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF PANELISTS ALL NOW BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I WILL BEGIN I'M GONNA START WITH- YOU MISS COOPER I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I- EAGERLY READ THE FIRST CALLING REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN OF FOLLOWED EVERY ITERATION. THUS FAR THAT IS WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO IMPLEMENTATION I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO ASK SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY GET SOME RESPONSES- I WILL BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS ON THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT- IN OUR DISCUSSION IT IT SAID THAT IT WAS INVOLVING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM BUT IT DIDN'T X. PLEASANTLY SAY THAT. IT WAS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL KIDS WHO ARE WITH IN FOSTER CARE- I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO ASK YOU THAT AS WELL AS TO UNDERSTAND IF IT WILL ALSO BE INCLUSIVE OF- THOSE WHO ARE IN THE HIT IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO BORING HERE TO SECURE MANAGEMENT- WE ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULING HAVING BE ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH ECM BUCKET WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WOULD GO LIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THAT WAS REALLY BASED OFF OF A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK THAT WE JUST NEED MORE TIME. TO UNPACK ON THAT PARTICULAR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WHO WOULD BE IN AND OUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT CAN IMPACT SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE. INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD NEED ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT SO THAT'S ONE PIECE OF ADVICE SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FULL STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP RIGHT NOW THAT WE ARE WORKING ON TO BUILD. THAT CHILDREN AND YOUTH ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD GO LIVE NEXT YEAR. HOWEVER I WOULD JUST SAY ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE RIGHT I THINK IT IS MEANT TO TOUCH THE HIGHEST MOST COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS OFTEN WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING QUESTIONS AROUND CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE CHILD WELFARE. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY ARE SOME OF OUR MOST COMPLEX. INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE DO ANTICIPATE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE OF THOSE CHILDREN WOULD NEED SOME LEVEL OF ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT SUPPORT- BUT WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REPORT THAT ONCE WE KNOW MORE. IN REGARDS TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE CONSULTING. WITH REGARDS ABOUT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE. I'M GONNA DIG INTO LITTLE BIT SO THE PAGED. OF THE- THERE TALK OF THE IN. COORDINATION OF CARE. THE FOURTH BULLET DOWN TALKS ABOUT ENSURING CONTINUOUS AND INTEGRATED CARE. HOW ARE THE PLANS ACTUALLY PLANNING TO OPERATIONALIZE THAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE I'M- ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT. THE INTEGRATION IT'S EASY TO SAY BUT IT'S HARD TO OPERATIONALIZE WOULD LOVE MORE DETAILS. I AGREE WITHYOU I'D SAY BUT- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT WITH ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- THEN WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE THE OTHER KIND OF CASE MANAGEMENT THAT WE PROVIDE OUR COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT- WHEN SOMEONE SIGNS ON AS A PROVIDER TO BE AN ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. WE HAVE A STANDARD CONTRACT FOR ALL ECM PROVIDERS STATEWIDE REGARDLESS OF MANAGED CARE PLAN THAT LET OUTLINED THE KIND OF VERY DETAILED EXPECTATIONS SOMEBODY IS OUR NEED TO MEET IF THEY BECOME AN ECM PROVIDER IN ONE OF THOSE IS BEING WILLING TO BE DE CORPS. A CASE MANAGER CARE MANAGER OF FOR THAT PATIENT REGARDLESS OF DELIVERY SYSTEM I THOUGHT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHO COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ECM I THINK CAN HAPPEN YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM THREE FOUR FIVE YOU SEEN MATCH ON WITH SOME OF OUR EXAMPLES. OF TO YOU KNOW TWELVE PLUS CASE MANAGERS ACROSS VARIOUS SYSTEMS ARE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BECOMING AN ECM. PROVIDER MEANS THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO BE THE MAIN POINT OF CONTACT FOR THAT PERSON FAMILY- TO BE ABLE TO WORKING ACROSS THOSE VERY SYSTEMS ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING A CARE PLAN TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF THAT INDIVIDUAL I'M IN SO IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT REGARD. VERSUS THE OTHER TYPES OF CASE MANAGEMENT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED WHERE YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE PROVIDING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES NOW THIS DOESN'T MEAN AN ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT PROVIDER MAYBE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER CASE MANAGERS OR SYSTEM. BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE OBLIGATION THAT THEY ARE TAKING ARE WHEN THEY ARE WORKING ACROSS THE SYSTEMS AS AN ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT PROVIDER IT'S ALSO WHY THE POPULATIONS THE FOCUS THAT WE HAVE ZEROED IN ON ARE REALLY THOSE POPULATIONS THAT ARE YOU MOST VULNERABLE IN COMPLEX. OFTEN TOUCHING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR MEDIC COW- SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT STANDARD CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND EXPECTATIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE. A SIMILAR OUTCOME ACROSS THE STATE OF HOW. THE HERE'S THE MINIMUM OF WHAT YOU MUST YOU TO BE THE TYPE OF. AND THEN THERE BE OTHER THINGS ADDED AND THAT IS WHY OF THE WAYS WERE HOPE FOR. AMERICANS OUTCOME AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THE INTEGRATION ACROSS OUR SYSTEMS BUT IT WILL BE. A CHANGE THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS IS HARD TO DEAL ON IT SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDERS AS THEY WORK THROUGH THAT TRANSITION. I'M ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE AGENDA WE TALK ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE TRANSITIONAL CARE. ENDED DESCRIBES IT AS THE NEED TO FACILITATE TRANSITIONS FROM. AND AMONG TREATMENT FACILITIES- I I'D LIKE TO. UNDER'S WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO WORK WITH THE ENHANCED COORDINATION OF CARE THAT WE JUST MENTIONED ARE WE- PLANNING TO ENSURE AS WE'RE TRANSITIONING FROM- ONE SITE TO ANOTHER THAT WERE COORDINATING I. LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK DOES THIS INCLUDE OUR CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS- AS WE HAVE HERE IN. SACRAMENTO ARE WE ABLE TO ENSURE THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION A FEW PIECES HERE AND I'LL TOUCH ON ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT PER SECOND A LITTLE TOUCH ON SOME OF OUR AND FORTHCOMING CHANGES IN POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT I THINK TOUCH ON BOTH OF THE ITEMS THAT YOU'RE RAISING HERE. SO YES IT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A TRANSITION YOU ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM- AS WELL AS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS IN A UP IN INPATIENT STAY RECENTLY DISHED CHARGE ENSURING THAT ON THEIR SUCCESSFULLY WORKING WITH THAT BENEFICIARY. TO WHETHER IT'S MAKE SURE MEN RECONCILIATION HAPPENS UPON I'M HOME MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE ALL OF THE SUPPORT THEY NEED WHEN THEY TRANSITION HOME OR TO IS IN ASSISTED LIVING ENVIRONMENTS. WHATEVER THE ENVIRONMENT MAY BE ON TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT TRANSITION AND SO THAT WOULD BE A ROLE THAT ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT A PROVIDER WOULD PLAY ON BEFORE THESE INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW. ALSO TO YOUR EXAMPLE A CRISIS UNIT SO SOMEONE WHO MAYBE IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE- B. AS YOUR YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR A COMPLEX A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. ISSUES THAT THEY HAD A RECENT STATE OF CRISIS UNIT OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE HELPING APPROPRIATELY FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING INTO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY DATA FEED BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE ENTITIES TO BE AWARE OF WHEN THOSE INSTANCES HAPPEN- I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES THAT WE KNOW. WE NEED TO IMPROVE IS ALL OF THE VARIOUS DATA TRACKING POINTS AND HOW DO WE HAVE MORE REAL TIME ACCESS TO THOSE ON YOUR SHARING OF HEALTH INFORMATION SO THE- CASE MANAGERS CARE MANAGERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CRITICAL TRANSITIONS. ARE AWARE OF WINDY SERVICES TAKE PLACE SO THAT THEY CAN DO APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP ON AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE FUNDING WITH HALF OF FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO HELP PROVIDERS AND OTHERS IMPLEMENT THOSE KIND OF KEY DATA SHARING POINTS. WITHIN TELLING- AND WE ARE HOPING TO WATCH THOSE THAT. LATER THIS YEAR THAT PROVIDE CAN. BE ABLE TO ARE. THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE DO THAT. YOUR OTHER POINT I WOULD ADD IS WE OUR- HELP MANAGEMENT. STRUCTURE THAT WILL BE ROLLING OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE ONE OF THE KEY ON PLACES AS AROUND A STANDARDIZATION AND HIGH EXPECTATIONS AROUND TRANSITIONS OF CARE. OF WHETHER THAT IS INPATIENT EMERGENCY ROOMS SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. OR THE VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRANSITIONS YOU ARE MENTIONING OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE KEY. REQUIREMENTS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN HALF YOUR MANAGEMENT OR THE FACILITIES TO MEET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HAVING A- SMOOTHER AND HIGHER QUALITY TRANSITIONS. ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN THE TIMES WHERE OUR MOST VULNERABLE CAN FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN WE DO KNOW THAT IT IS A KEY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROVING HEALTH OUT COMES IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING SOMEONE SUCCESSFULLY. DO THAT NEXT. YOU KNOW CONTINUE ONE. OF SERVICE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DAY I WILL MENTION WHEN WE TOWARD A CS YOU HERE I DID NOT SEE THAT LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND- REALLY WOULD HOPE AS WERE ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIC CAL THAT WE CAN GET THERE. WERE WERE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WHAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TREATMENT AT THE RIGHT TIME AND- OFTENTIMES YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHICH STORE. PEOPLE COME INTO AND- THEN WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE COORDINATING WELL AND SO THAT'S WHY I. AM ASKING SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS NEW BENEFIT- I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TRANSITION TO COMMUNITY SUPPORTS IF I CAN- I WILL JUST FOR TRACKING PURPOSES MENTIONED THIS. HAS BEEN CALLED IN LIEU OF SERVICES BEFORE HAND- WILL SAY I PREFERRED THE NEW TERM I. THINK IT IS MORE FITTING. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK WHY THIS IS OPTIONAL WHY WE HAVE CREATED SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY- IS. IS IT. SO THAT WE CAN BE ADDITIVE. TO THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. HOW WILL WE AND- THAT IT WILL BE ROBUST ENOUGH. YOU'RE ON MUTE MISS COOPER. THANK YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME. WHEN IT. YES WE CAN. I THANK YOU FOR A SECOND AFTER YOU SAID IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND I GREATLY APOLOGIZE TO ASK YOU TO CAN YOU RESTATE YOUR QUESTION WHY ARE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS OPTIONAL WHY HAVE WE CREATED SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY. IS IT SO THAT WE CAN BE ADDITIVE TO THE-COMMUNITY SUPPORTS HOW WILL YOU HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE THAT. THE SUPPORTS THAT ARE ROBUST ENOUGH YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE KIND OF MOVE THE NEEDLE ON SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH- AND REALLY GETTING MORE PREVENTIVE IN UPSTREAM IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY ACROSS THE STATE- WITHIN FEDERAL GOT. THIS OPPORTUNITY IN WHAT WE CALL AND BELOVED- AND IT ALLOWED US PRETTY BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING IN MEDICAID- AND REALLY SEE HOW WOULD YOU GROW THAT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WE KNEW IF WE CAME IN WITH A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF FOURTEEN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS ALL GOING LIVE. ON AT ONE TIME- THAT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS CURRENTLY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE. THESE CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONTRACTS AND CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN OVER TIME- THERE IS A CLEAR ENOUGH GUARD RAILS AND I STRUCTURE WITHIN THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE. THAT WE DID THINK THOUGH IT IS A REALLY GOOD AVENUE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REALLY ADDRESS SOCIAL DRIVERS AND HELP. INTO INVEST IN THESE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO BUILD NETWORKS OVER TIME WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO NOT JUST IMPLEMENTED. THE REALLY INCENTIVIZE THE UTILIZATION THE PARTNERSHIPS THE RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS THE- REALLY MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN CHANGE MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THIS TYPE OF LARGE SCALE CHANGE. ON THAT SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE COMFORTABLE WITH SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. WE DO KNOW THAT OVER TIME WE WILL BE CONSTANTLY EVALUATING IF AND WHEN WE NEED TO SWITCH FROM WHAT IS A IN LIEU OF SERVICE WHERE IT'S MORE FLEXIBLE. TO A POTENTIAL FULL TIME BENEFIT RIGHT AWAY THERE ARE DIFFERENT OF GUARD RAILS IN FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY- BUT FROM A- FEDERAL PERSPECTIVE THEY ALSO CONSIDER THIS A CAR A PART OF WHAT THEY CALL CORD MEDICAID- SO IT HAS A NUMBER OF PROTECTIONS IN GUARD RAILS WITH IT- AND SO. I THINK THAT IS WHY WE REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD STILL NEED THE NEEDS OF ON ADDRESSING SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH ALLOWING FOR THAT. PHASE THEN BUILD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ALLOWS US TO KIND OF BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE. NECESSARY FOR THE LONG RUN. YOUR TO MENTION CORE MEDICAID AND THAT MADE THE- FOR THE NEXT FEW QUESTIONS I HAVE. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PLANS DON'T OFFER THESE SPECIFIC COMMUNITY- SUPPORTS THAT WE'RE ALKING ABOUT OR THEY CHANGE THEM AFTER SIX MONTHS AS IS- ALLOWABLE. IN THE AGENDA. HOW WILL WE TRACK THOSE RESULTS AND HOW DO WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THEY RESULT IN GOOD OUTCOMES. SURE YOU PIECES HERE SO WE ARE THE GOOD THING IS AS YOU HEARD IN OUR OPENING COMMENTS A VERY BROAD TAKE UP OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT ACROSS ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN ALL COUNTIES- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WERE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS PICKING UP THE VARIOUS PIECES OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT OVER THE FIRST TWO YEARS AS WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON OUR OUR WEBSITE. AND SO I WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO. ADD NEW COMMUNITY SUPPORTS I THINK THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD AS MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HER. LANCE WHO SAID THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL SERVICES THEY NEED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR BENEFICIARIES. I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERSECTION WITH SOME OF THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED AND LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. A THAT WERE ADDED INTO THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS LIST OF SERVICES- IT'S A WE WILL MONITOR THAT VERY CLOSELY IF FOR SOME REASON BC MANAGED CARE PLANS ELECTING TO. END A COMMUNITY SUPPORT IN WHICH THEY HAVE OFFERED A WE WILL TRACK THAT BERRY CLOSELY. IN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ELECTED TO PICK THEM UP WE ARE HAVING VERY ROBUST REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY MANAGED CARE PLANS TO TRACK. A TO A TO TRACK THE KIND OF. UPTAKE AND UTILIZATION OF THESE SERVICES- WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THEM CLOSELY IN REGARDS TO YOU ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE. ON THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE INTENDED FOR THEM NOT JUST IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN REGARDS TO REDUCTION OF YOUR INFORMATION OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BUT ALSO THE IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. ON THE QUALITY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE SEEN- SO SUCCESSFULLY WITHIN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. WE DIDN'T DO THIS IN A BOX WE REALLY TOOK A LOT OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH PROBLEMS YOU MOVE THEM INTO KIND OF STATEWIDE STRUCTURE. OF AND SO WE ARE REALLY. HOPEFUL AND HAVE SEEN GREAT OUR COMMITMENT BUYER MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND WILL CONTINUE. TO MONITOR THIS VERY CLOSELY. I'M TO TRAIN NOW TO THE MATH CARE INCENTIVE. ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THE AGENDA AS WELL AS- PATH HI. I'M TRYING TO ASK HOW WE ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE. GOING TO BE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED- WILL COUNTIES WHO HAVE IMPLEMENTED WHOLE PERSON CARES AND HOME HEALTH. BE FIRST IN LINE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS WILL THEY GET RESOURCES FIRST. WILL THERE BE FUNDING FOR LAGGING COUNTIES LATER OR WILL IT BE THAT THE SAME COUNTIES GETTING THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING THAT ARE CURRENTLY GETTING THE FUNDING TODAY. WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT SO- INCENTIVE DOLLARS AND PASS A DOLLARS ARE DISTRIBUTED DIFFERENTLY I'M SO FOR THE CALLANAN SENSITIVE PROGRAM- THAT IS BROADLY ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL COUNTIES WILL. OF OUR PARTICIPATING ALL PLANS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE US SO ANY PLAN MEETING THOSE MEASURES WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW DOWN THOSE INCENTIVE FUNDS WERE WE ARE REALLY INCENTIVIZING THE BUILDING OUT OF PROVIDER NETWORKS- AND IT THAT INCLUDES ANY COUNTIES THAT ARE NON WHOLE PERSON CARE A COUNTIES ARE JUST REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE PATH FUNDS IT IS WHY WE SPECIFICALLY NEW WE NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER PATHWAY FOR DIRECT PROVIDER A GRANTS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP US REALLY ACHIEVE WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVING TELLING FOR BOTH AND HE HAS CARE MANAGEMENT. IN COMMUNITIES. AMAZING IN IN ARE TRANSITIONING INTO CALIFORNIA- WELL WE KNOW SOME OF THEM MAY NEED TO GROW THEIR CAPACITY OR TAKE ON NEW POPULATIONS OF FOCUS WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER PROVIDERS IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDED THAT REALLY CRITICAL INVESTMENT FUNDING TO GET UP AND RUNNING. PARTNER WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS SO WE ARE- THINKING BROADLY AROUND HOW THIS HAPPENS GET DISTRIBUTED WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR THIS IS AROUND STATE WIDE EXPANSION OF IN HIS CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SPORTS NOT JUST IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE. YES IT'S ALSO WHY WERE ALLOWING FOR SOME PLANNING DOLLARS TO GO OUT FOR SMALLER OR WHAT AREAS THAT MAY NEED TAX BRING SOMEONE IN AND HELP THEM DEVELOP A PLAN AND THEN BE ABLE TO FUND VARIOUS PIECES WERE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- COLLABORATION DOLLARS LOCALLY BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT THIS TO REACH ALL OF THE RIGHT PROVIDERS TO COME TO THE TABLE AND PARTNER WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE RURAL AREAS ORANGE COUNTY'S ARE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY OPERATING WHOLE PERSON CARE SERVICES AND SO WE WILL BE A VERY INTENTIONAL AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS GO TO. ALL THE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN REACHED THE PROVIDERS THAT REALLY NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE PARTNER WITH OUR PLANS. THANK YOU FOR THAT INTENTIONALITY- I'M GONNA STICK WITH PATH IF I CAN- IT STATES THAT IT THERE ARE WARM HANDOFFS THAT WILL OCCUR FROM OUR COUNTY JAILS TO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AS WELL AS OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN. AGAIN OUR WE OPERATIONALIZE IN SOME OF THOSE WARM HAND OFFS- I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO. HAVE YOU. HAD A LITTLE DETAILS YOU CAN. SURE SO ON ONE OF THE AN ISSUE WHICH IN CAL PULLED. AND WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE JUSTICE PACKAGE THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON- PROVIDING SERVICES WHILE SOMEONE IS INCARCERATED IN A- PRISON JAIL OR JUVENILE FACILITY. FOR NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO RELEASE AND THEN UP ON RIPLEY'S DOING WHAT WE'RE CALLING A ACCORD NEEDED RE ENTRY OR DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF SERVICES. ARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES BEING PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE MANDATING WHAT'S CALLED A WARM HANDOFF. YOU ARE MOST LIKELY WOULD BE THE COUNTY FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH OR- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES BUT IN THE CASE THAT IT. INCLUDES A MORE MILD TO MODERATE. AD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. THIS WAS. APPROVED AND AB ONE THIRTY THREE LAST YEAR I'M AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH HOW WE DO THAT WORK NEEDED RE ENTRY SO SOME OF THOSE TAX DOLLARS THAT. HE FUNDED IS REALLY HELP SUPPORT- OUR JUSTICE PARTNERS IN OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THOSE WARM HAND OFF TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS. DID YOU- EARLY ASSESSMENTS WHEN POSSIBLE I'M IDENTIFIED IN START TREATMENT WHEN POSSIBLE AND THEN DO A HAND OFF TO THE CORRESPONDING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE TO REALLY HELP FUND- THAT IMPRESSION INFRASTRUCTURE START UP. ON THE AND TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DO THOSE WARM HAND OFF AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD AND- I WOULD JUST NOTE WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST A JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES JUSTICE PARTNERS COUNTY PARTNERS PROVIDERS. A LARGE NUMBER OF AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS HELPING A CHIC WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW. TO DO IT WELL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL STAY THEN WITH PATH FOR ONE MORE. ON WERE FORCE- WITHIN THE ENHANCED MANAGEMENT- BENEFIT EARLIER WHICH DOES INVOLVE OUR JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE NEED FOR EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT- WHETHER OR NOT THAT ASSISTANCE WILL BE AS ROBUST AS THE PATH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THAT IDENTIFIED SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE PAST PROPOSAL HOW WILL THEY BE DIFFERENT WILL ONE BE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE DON'T DUPLICATE. DUPLICATE SERVICES. THANK YOU I THINK I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I THINK THAT DOMINANTLY THE YOUNG ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO WITH IN THE PAST FUNDING IS TO ACQUIRE MORE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO DO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET THEM TRAINED UP TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BRING THEM ON TIMELY AND INTO YOU I'M IN BED THEN INTO THE WORKFLOW AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT MANY OF THE DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO YOU TO FUNDS OF BOTH THE CROSSED YOU KNOW ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT OUR COMMUNITY SUPPORTS IN THE JUSTICE PACKAGE BROADLY YOU KNOW THAT- THESE ARE BRINGING A NEW RESOURCES AIR- AND SO THE TRAINING AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED THAT WELL IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I'M IN SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FUND THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S HARD FOR PROVIDERS TO TAKE ON THAT THAT RISK- WHEN YOU ARE MAKING THIS LEVEL OF CHANGE AND SO WE ARE HOPING TO YOU AUGMENT THAT WITH SOME OF THE- FUNDING. I WILL TRY. OUT THE POPULAR HEALTH MANAGEMENT ON PAGE EIGHTEEN OF THE AGENDA- WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT GOALS IN THE SPACE- DO WE HAVE SUFFICIENT H. I. T. WORK FORCE- FOR THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKING AS A STATE. HI WE LOST YOU AGAIN. MY DAUGHTER BY DOCTOR IMAGES IN A NATIONAL PEACE I'M IN A HOTEL ROOM IT'S NOT THE IDEAL SITUATION FOR I'M CONNECTIVITY'S I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WITH ME BUT I DIDN'T LOSE YOU CAN YOU REFRAME YOUR QUESTION YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO- DO WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT H. I. T. WORK FORCE TO IMPLEMENT THE POPULATION. HEALTH MANAGEMENT EFFORTS WERE TAKING AS THE STATE. GOT IT IM NOT FOR THAT PARTICULAR ONE WE- DONNELLY WILL BE USING OUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE WHICH WAS FUNDED IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR WHERE WE WILL BE GOING OUT FOR AN RFP TO REALLY TAKE ALL OF THE DATA AND INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW TWO YEARS YES HAS ACCESS TO SO MUCH INFORMATION AND DATA. ON WHETHER IT'S OUR ENCOUNTER DATA CLAIMS DATA- AND THEN OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS LIKE I JUST SAT OR DEVELOPMENTAL. DISABILITY SERVICES- IN BOULDER INTO ONE PLATFORM. WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO GET THAT MOVING AND I THINK THAT LEVEL OF INFORMATION WILL ALLOW US DO YOU. A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING RISK STRATIFICATION. AS WELL AS SHARING INFORMATION WITH. PROVIDERS IN OUR VENDORS THIS YEAR SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO A BUILDING THAT OUT- IN THE FUTURE AND DO YOU FEEL THIS TIME WE HAVE A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION. ABOUT COURSE AS EACH I. D. NEXANS. IN A FEW. WANT TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION FOR SOME OF THAT ADDITIONAL DATA THAT CAN BE. THE. OR CALL. MISTER PRESIDENT FOR BEING POPULOUS IN STRONG- IT WOULD SAY WE ARE HEADING IN A NEW TO IN US WORK AND PATHWAY MAY NEED TO BE TO AS WELL- HENCE WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ASK THE QUESTION AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP- I WILL MOVE NOW TO FEE FOR SERVICE- BENEFITS THAT ARE CARVED OUT- EARLIER MEDIC WELL APART CONDITION. AND HAD AN UPDATE HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON HOW THINGS ARE LOOKING TODAY AND THE DIRECTION THAT THEY'RE GOING. SURE- AND APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO GIVE THAT UPDATE SO- OUR CALL TIMES ARE READ THE REDUCED WE ARE ABLE TO PICK UP VERY TIGHTLY ON ON CALLS COMING INTO OUR CALL CENTER WE ALSO FOR US SINCE. EARLY FEBRUARY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TURNAROUND TIME- WITHIN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AND SO I WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL HOPEFUL- IN REGARDS TO WHERE WE ARE ON THE TEAM IS WORKING EXTENSIVELY WITH MAGELLAN TO FIGURE OUT OUR FUTURE FORWARD TRANSITION PLAN- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDER. A GRANDFATHERING OF COLOR SEE- FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS UNTIL WE ARE DEVELOPING WHAT THAT FUTURE RIVER TRANSITION A LOOKS LIKE IN REGARDS TO YOU SLOWLY MOVING INTO YOU ARE WHERE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE FUTURE- FORTHCOMING GUIDANCE THE DEPARTMENT WILL COME OUT ONCE WE HAVE A FULL. A PLAN AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO APPROACH THAT- BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE- YOU'RE FULLY ENGAGED WITH PROVIDERS WE ARE WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOR FEEDBACK LOOPS I TO IMPROVE OUR OUR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. THAT ARE IN A LOT OF PLACES LAST TIME WE DID YOU AND EIGHT. THE MEDIGAP TAX- DO ONE OF THE ADMIN. TO LISTENING TO MANY OF THE CAN. THAT COMMUNITY WAS BRINGING UP IN MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES SET. I WAS BOTH TIMELY AND IMPORTANT AND GLAD- YOU DID- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON NOW TO LTSS INTEGRATION AND THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IF I CAN- WITHIN IT YOU SAY THAT THERE IS SELECTIVE CONTRACTING- WHO IS THIS. HAVE WE ALREADY IDENTIFIED- OR SELECTED AN ENTITY- IT SAYS THE DH CS INTENDS TO USE SELECTIVE CONTRACTING. TO MOVE TOWARDS ALIGNED ENROLLMENT OF MEDICAL. MANAGED CARE AND DE SNAPS OPERATED BY ONE INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION. CAN YOU SPEAK MORE TO THE SELECTIVE CONTRACTING. I'M NOT QUITE SURE- ALL THE GIANTS FOR MY CONNECTION ISSUES TODAY. WE WILL COME BACK TO SELECTIVE CONTRACTING THEM- HOPING I CAN STICK WITH THE SNAPS- I I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE MOVING TO THE ALIGNMENT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT EVIDENCE HELPS US TO SUPPORT THIS TRANSITION IS THERE ARE DATA THAT WE HAVE THAT HELPS US TO SUPPORT IT IS THEIR- DATA FOR THE NON ALONE ALIGNED DE SNAPS. HOW ARE WE MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS TRANSITION IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. SURE I'M JUST TO MAYBE HELP WITH MY CONNECTION I'M GONNA TURN MY VIDEO OFFICE THAT'S OKAY. I'LL STILL BE HERE ENROLLMENT I MEAN REALLY AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I'M HERE IS I'M THAT WE ARE ABLE TO KIND OF INTEGRATE THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES TOGETHER ON IT YOU KNOW REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS DO INDIVIDUALS WHO. I'M SHOULD HAVE A COORDINATED BENEFIT ON IN THE EXCLUSIVELY AND LYFT IN ROME IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO DO THAT IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE- BENEFICIARY STILL HAVE THEIR CHOICE OF THE MEDICARE ENROLLMENT INTO A LINE THAT WITH THE MEDIC HOW- PLAN THAT ALSO OFFERS THAT SEEM SERVICES. IT ALLOWS ONE PLANNED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HOW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THAT IN THE MOST WORK NEEDED WAY WE REALLY HAVE SO MANY LEARNINGS FROM CCI AND IF ONE OF LEARNING THAT WE HAVE IS REALLY THAT INTEGRATION OF THOSE SERVICES TO COORDINATE ALL OF THE SERVICES MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TOGETHER. REALLY ALLOWS FOR A BETTER OUTCOMES AND SO THAT'S WHY WE REALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU- BENEFICIARIES TO HAVE THAT ALIGNED ENROLLMENT. SO THAT THEY AREN'T MANAGING TO DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DIFFERENT- SETS OF EXPECTATIONS BUT ONE PLAN ONE POINT OF CONTACT WORK NEEDING ALL OF THEIR SERVICES AND HOW CRITICAL THAT IS UPPER OUTCOMES. IN THESE REALLY PARTNERED WITH CMS IN REGARDS TO THIS AND THEY ARE REALLY. LEVERAGING THIS UP IN REGARDS TO YOU ON THAT ARE JUST BEING A BEST PRACTICE AND SO WE WERE REALLY HAPPY THAT THIS WAS APPROVED IN EIGHTY ONE THIRTY THREE LAST YEAR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING BETTER. FOR DUAL BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M I'M GONNA TO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT THREE FOUR- EARLIER WE HEARD. THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET ANNUAL UPDATES FOR THE ESTABLISHED RATES TO ENSURE THAT. REIMBURSEMENT REFLECTS THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS- INCLUDED IN THOSE UPDATES. SO THAT WE CAN TRACK THESE COST TRENDS- CAN WE- EXPECT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- THIS INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. SURE SO AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS COMMITTED IN BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES IN REGARDS TO YOU- PAYMENT REFORM IN THE FEE SCHEDULES WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE MAKING THIS LARGE OF A TRANSITION ACROSS THE STATE WITH THIS MANY SERVICES YOU WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS CLOSELY. ON INTENSELY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS EACH YEAR WITHIN THOSE FIRST FEW YEARS AND THEY'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AND COMMITTED TO KEEPING THE LEGISLATURE UPDATED. EACH YEAR WITH ANY OF THOSE RESPECTIVE TO EACH. I WAS HOPING TO FOLLOW UP WITH- MISS SENDS I BELIEVE FROM- SOLANO COUNTY- HE YOUR COMMENT WAS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT BEEN BUILT BECAUSE IT'S ONLY AFTER THE FUNDING- CAN THE COUNTY BEGIN TO PLAN- I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT PRUDENT RESERVES THAT COME FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ACT THAT WE HAVE HEARD ARE- RECEIVING HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUES THIS PAST YEAR THEY'RE NOT FUNDS FOR US TO BEGIN SUPPORTING SOME OF THE EXPECTED TRANSITION WHILE THOSE OF US HERE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION DISCUSS HOW WE CAN- INSURE WE ARE SUPPORTING YOU- EFFECTIVELY AS WELL. HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS THAT- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE COR MEDIC CAL BENEFIT SO- I'M- SERB CROSSING OVERIN USING ME TO SAY TO PROVIDE THE COURSE THE COURSE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS. NOT REALLY WHAT OUR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND WHAT ARE AN HSA PLANS ARE ABOUT- EVEN SLOW- SOLANO COUNTY IN PARTICULAR IS THE COUNTY THAT DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF PRUDENT RESERVE I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE LESS THAN THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IN IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VIABLE FOR US I'M SORRY I CAN'T SPEAK FOR SACRAMENTO- THERE. NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL INFORMATION AND I APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK THAT ALLOWS ME THAN TO ASK MISS COOPER HOW WE ARE- RECENTLY EXPECTING THESE COUNTIES TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ABSORB THESE PATIENTS- WHAT TYPES OF FUNDS ARE WE EXPECTING THEM. TO FRONT HOW DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- SUPPORT THESE COUNTIES DURING THIS TRANSITION A DCS CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH- SACRAMENTO AND IN SOLANO IN YOUR GARCIA THIS. ON THE USE OF A REALIGNMENT AND OPTIONS THAT WE CAN EXPLORE IN THE FUTURE AND AS THOSE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE TO BE HAPPY TO KEEP. YOU UPDATED AS A ABOUT. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH PANEL ONE WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PANEL TO. WHICH IS ON THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF THE SUSPENSION OF MEDIC CAL ENROLLMENT FOR ADULT INMATES. WE WILL HAVE ONE PRESENTER ON THIS PANEL WHO WILL BE- RENEE MAILLOT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY WITH DH CS. THE SMALL- CAN YOU PLEASE BEGIN. YES THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO- DH CS PROPOSES THAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE DURATION OF SUSPENSION MEDIC HEALTH. FOR DAHLE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE EXTENDED FROM A ONE YEAR TIME LIMIT SUSPENSION. SUSPENSION THAT REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL THE INDIVIDUAL IS NO LONGER INCARCERATED IN A PUBLIC INSTITUTION IF THEY ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MEDICARE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE SUSPENSION SHELL AND- ON THE DATE THE INDIVIDUAL IS EITHER NO LONGER AN INMATE AT A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THAT THEY BECOME AN INMATE AT THAT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE VERY SIMILAR. ELIMINATING THE CURRENT- EXISTING ONE YOUR LIMIT ON SUSPENSION OF MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR ADULT INMATES WILL ALLOW KERN COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS TO SIMPLY LIFT THE SUSPENSION ON THE INDIVIDUALS RELEASED FROM THE CORRECTIONAL CENTER. THIS PROPOSAL OUTLINES FEDERAL LAW IN SUPPORT WHICH ELIMINATES TIME LIMITED SUSPENSIONS FOR ELIGIBLE SUPPORT ACT FEDERAL LAW REQUIRED ANNUAL READ DETERMINATION FOR MOLD THE VISUALS EACH YEAR. MORNING PARTS RAINY INDIVIDUAL THIS WOULD HAVE NECESSITATED ANGLE RETIREMENT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THEIR INCARCERATION. EMPIRE TO THE FEDERAL SUPPORT ACTOR WITH NO PREVIOUS FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT OFFERS EASE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE PROVISIONS SUSPENSION FROM MY BENEFIT PERSPECTIVE VERSUS AN ELIGIBILITY PERSPECTIVE. WITH THE NEW FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT WAS DERIVED FROM THE SUPPORT ACT STATES NOW HAVE AN ABILITY TO DEVELOP A SUSPENSION PROCESS. USING THE TWO PATHWAYS EITHER ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS EXPANSION. WHEN WE USE THE ELIGIBILITY PATHWAY IT DOES NOT NECESSITATE AND OVERRULES AND AS SUCH THE SUSPENSION POLICY WILL BE APPLIED SIMILARLY ACROSS OUR BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE ENFORCING IN TERMS OF OUR TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS MELO BRING IT UP TO THE DIS FOR ANY QUESTIONS I WILL SIMPLY PROVIDE A COMMENT ON BOTH APPRECIATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL. ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE HEIGHTENED ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON THE HIGH NEED TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED POPULATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING A PART. I WOULD. THANK PANEL TO WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM PANEL THREE ON TWO PROPOSALS RELATED TO SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS WE WILL HAVE ONE PRESENTER ON THIS PANEL IT WILL BE DR KELLY PFEIFER THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DR FIVE FOR WHEN YOU ARE READY.

THANK YOU DR FIVE FOR OPEN IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY QUESTIONS I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT. THE I'M HOPE YOU CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT ON- AND DETAIL ABOUT S. T. R. T. P.'S- IN GENERAL HOW MANY. BEDS ARE THERE FOR US AS A ST TAMMANY. FACILITIES DO WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE- NEED. OF BEDS AT S. T. R. T. P.'S DO WE HAVE ENOUGH- ARE THERE'D DISPARITIES GEOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION- HOPING YOU CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LICENSED AND UNLICENSED ISSUES THAT WE HAVE- AS I'M TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT IF WE NEED OTHER OPTIONS AS WE FILL OUT OUR CONTINUUM OF CARE- THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS ANALYSIS FROM YOUR DOCTOR FIVE FOR IF YOU CAN. THANK YOU REALLY AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT THE SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OR WE ARE WORKING ON CLOSELY BECAUSE THE ACTOR TV'S ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OF AN EVOLUTION. RECOGNIZING THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING PER CHILD AND PARENTING AND TO BE PART OF A FAMILY. AND THAT'S HOW COME THEY'RE NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THESE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES ARE GROUP CONTACT JACQUI PEACEFUL REALLY DEVELOPED TO CHANGE THE MODEL OF. FIFTEEN OF PUTTING A BUNCH OF KIDS IN A GROUP HOME INDEFINITELY AND NOT WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE THEY NEED. SPECIALIZED SERVICES THAT WAS REALLY A PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THESE GROUP HOMES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR SHORT TERM OR A SHORT TERM PART OF THE DEFINITION. AND OTHER THERAPEUTIC WILL BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OVERSIGHT AND TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THEY GET NOW PROGRAM APPROVAL THAT THAT WILL PROVIDING SERVICES. ULTIMATELY WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING AS PART OF THE- LARGER DISHES EITHER YOU'RE VERY WELL AWARE OF THE CONTINUAL CALIFON THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS TO BUILD OUT. OTHER CHOICES ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE ECONOMY AND CARE SETTINGS OKAY WHAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER OF- DANCER I THINK THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT QUESTION ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK. MANY WOULD SAY LESS THAN WE HAVE NOW BUT IF WE DON'T KEEP THOSE BAD ACTIVE NOW THAN WE WILL GREATLY RESPECT CHILDREN WILL HAVE A CRISIS OF PLACEMENT AND CAN READ COMMONSENSE HAVING LOTS OF FOLLOW UP SO. OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THAT PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICES SO HAS IT LIVED. THAT WE MAINTAIN THE- BETTER AVAIL HAS GO AGAIN ALTERNATIVES AND FOR THE THAT SITUATION YEARS NOW VERY DIFFERENT THAN ADULTS. AND THAT IS A WHY WE YOU TRIED. BUNGALOW TO. OF ALL UNDER REALLY. I THAT AROUND THE THESE AND HIS SMALLER STOPPED. SO I CAN PROVIDE YOU AFTER FACT WITH THE- NUMBER OF DEAD BUT HAVE TO. KEEPING IN THAT. HOW THAT SHE- AND THE EXACT THEM OF THE TWO. THAT WE OF COURSE. BUT OUR GOAL COURSE TO GET THEM COUNT. TO REYES A FAMILY AND NOT TO BE. HUNDRED GRANDMOTHER KNOW THAT. MANY CHILDREN HAVE COME NEEDS THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE NURSING HOME THAT'S WHY WE CREATED MODEL FATAL IDENTIFY UP OTHER QUESTIONS AFTER IT- I WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT IT SOUNDED LIKE COUNTIES ARE A PARTNER HERE THAT. DH CS IS- WORKING TO GALLAGHER DELEGATE.% SOME OF THE AT THE- ARE YOU EIGHT THE I. M. D. I'D LIKE TO. ON WHY AREN'T MORE COUNT HELPING TO A VALUE TEN TO PREFER THESE TO. SINCE IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE. S. T. R. T. P.'S THERE CURRENTLY ARE NOT. LICENSED WHAT IS THE- DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING A LICENSE. CURRENTLY FOR SOME OF THESE S. T. R. T. P.'S IS IT A STAFFING ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE A DH CS WAS AT. COUNTIES WHO NEED TO HELP US TO PARTICIPATE. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY- WITHIN THE SYSTEM- IF WE'RE NOT- EVALUATING THE FACILITIES. YEAH AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN GET THEM LICENSED I THINK I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT'S A ISSUE OF STAFFING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR HOW WE CAN ASSIST YOU- TO. GET MORE OF THESE FACILITIES EVALUATED. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL WE PUT FORWARD WHERE FLEX STAFFING THAT WE NEED TO DO THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL SHOULD BE CEAR WE DON'T LICENSE CORRECT HERE TO BE THE DHS. BUT WE DO PROVIDE A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL SO THAT- THE NUANCES THAT WORK APPROVING ABOUT HEALTH COMPONENT. NDSS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SHOULD THE COMPLAINTS- SO WE DO THINK THAT WITH THE RESOURCES OF THE OF THE QUESTION WE HAVE THE STAFFING WE NEED. THAT WE TAKE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN OUT PROGRAM APPROVALS REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH. THE CHALLENGES OF ALL BEING ON TRACK TREATMENT MODEL WHERE IF YOU HAD A GROUP HOME. THAT GROUPON THAT MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT SO BAD THAT PROVIDER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO WHEN SHE CHANGED A GROUP HOME INTERNET CARE DEEPLY WITH. OUR LITTLE BUDGET QUITE HONESTLY FAMILY NEEDED A PRETTY INTENSE AS- LEVEL OF STAFFING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WORK WITH THOSE PROVIDERS IN THE UNDERSTAND THE RULES. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. BUILD UP THOSE SERVICES- FINAL QUESTION I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OF SOME THE ARE- ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS WE ARE REGARDING C. C. R. REFORM. ARE ARE THEY FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION AS YOU WERE SAYING OF ATTEMPTING TO. MOVE AWAY FROM CONGREGATE CARE IS THAT LEADING TOWARDS SOME OF THE LICENSING ISSUES WERE HAVING WITH TIME DE HOW ARE WE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT- S. T. R. T. P.'S ARE EMPOWERED TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST. THANK YOU I HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR COLLECTIVE PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS B. THE ALLIANCE OF THE PROVIDERS OF PATIENTS. AND THE OR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION DIVISION WORKING HAND IN HAND TO TRY AND HELP YOU GET YOUR G. P. AND IN HAND WITH THE COUNTY. TO SUPPORT THEM TRANSITIONING THIS MODEL BECAUSE WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SOME VERY VERY LARGE CAMPUSES THAT WERE PRETTY DAUNTED BY THE REQUIREMENTS AND JUST A SEPARATE THINGS OUT RIGHT NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT MAKES. A FACILITY ME THINK FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TRANSPORTATION COLLECTIVITIES AND WHAT ALLOWS THEM TO FUNCTION WITHOUT DESIGNED TO DETERMINATION BECAUSE ABOUT THE I AM DETERMINATION GOT ON FEDERAL ACTUALLY SEEN AT GREAT WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF PROVIDERS TO LOOK AT. HOW YOU CAN TAKE A LARGER CAMPUS AND DIVIDE THEM UP INTO MORE SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONAL UNITS ARE YOU CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT. THAT LOOKS LASSEN HAS. CANFIELD'S LETTER EDUCATIONAL AND MORE LIKE A SMALL FAMILY HOME AND BY. PHYSICALLY HARD WORK BUT I FEEL A WEDNESDAY'S GREAT. ACROSS. NEEDS OF PATIENTS THAT OF VISION AND- IN THE OTHER TO. AND SERVICES. WITH THE I WILL THANK VERY PANEL AND WE WILL NOW MOVE TO FOR WHICH IS ON THE NURSING FACILITY FINANCING AND QUALITY OF CARE WE WILL HAVE FOUR PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL WE WILL BEGIN WITH DEPUTY DIRECTOR LINDA HARRINGTON WITH HEALTH CARE FINANCING. FOR DH CS WE WILL THEN HAVE TO FROM THE WHITEN WITH SEIU ANTHONY CHUCKLE TELL STAFF ATTORNEY WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND JENNIFER SNYDER THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. LET US BEGIN WITH LINDA LINDY HARRINGTON WITH DH CS. I'M LINDA HARRINGTON DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE FINANCING I'M HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- TO PRESENT TODAY- DCS RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF- LONG TERM FINANCING STABILITY. FOR THE HEALTH OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF HOW AIM IS A FOCUS ON TRANSFORMING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH BACK VALUE BASED INITIATIVES MODERNIZATION AND PAYMENT REFORM TO FURTHER THIS FOCUS DH CS IS FINALIZING A PROPOSAL THAT RECOGNIZES BOTH COST. AND INCENTIVIZES QUALITY WHICH WE ANTICIPATE RELEASING IN THE NEAR FUTURE I WOULD TEACH YES HELD A BROAD STAKEHOLDER MEETING IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'VE ENGAGE WITH A CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND CONTINUES TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SEIU. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AS. WE FINALIZE THIS PROPOSAL. RELATIVES YOU CAN OF BAKER REMEMBER METHODOLOGY APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNT FOR INCENTIVIZE INVESTMENT IN LABOR THE DEPARTMENT HAS SHARED WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WOULD RESPOND TO THIS CONCERN BY SEPARATELY ESTABLISHING THE ANNUAL RATE INCREASE PERCENTAGE. FOR THE LABOR COST CATEGORIES AND NON LABOR COST CATEGORIES WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE TIED TO LABOR COSTS THE MEDIC HOW ESTIMATE CURRENTLY ASSUMES A PLACEHOLDER 5% FOR THIS LABOR INCREASE. THIS WOULD BETTER REFLECT COSTS FROM FACILITIES AND DIRECTLY INCENTIVIZE FACILITIES TO INVEST MORE IN LABOR RELATED TO CONCERNS THAT THE CURRENT COST PROGRAM DOESN'T APPROPRIATELY INCENTIVIZE QUALITY THE DEPARTMENT HAS SHARED AND DISCUSSED WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SHIPPED FROM A PERCENTILE BASED PROGRAM. THAT LIMITS THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO A SUBSET OF FACILITIES TWENTY THRESHOLD PROGRAM ALLOWING ALL FACILITIES THAT NEED FOR QUALITY THRESHOLDS. TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL QUALITY FUNDING. RELATIVE TO THIS PROPOSALS WITHIN THE AGENDA AT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY EVALUATE AND SEVERAL BUT FALL OUTSIDE OF OUR EXPERTISE COMMENT CAN BE PERFORMED DTS PERFORMS AN EAGLE ON IT AND EACH NURSING FACILITY'S PROPHETIC COST REPORT. THE AUDIT INCLUDES A REVIEW OF THE COST REPORT TO ENSURE ONLY MEDIC HOW ELIGIBLE COSTS ARE UTILIZED FOR RATE SETTING PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE DH CS WILLETT JESTER AND LEMONY ANY NOT ELIGIBLE OR EXCESSIVE COSTS. INCLUDING PROFITS FROM RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WHAT IS THE BIG COST REPORTS INCLUDE ALL FACILITY COST NOT JUST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ONLY MEDICAL ELIGIBLE COSTS ARE INCLUDED WHEN SETTING THE ANNUAL PER DIEM RATE. WHICH IS PAID FOR. PAY FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES EACH YES OVERSIGHT PROCESS EASIER AND EVER EVOLVING FUNCTION BUT WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL DATA. UTILIZED TO SET RATES AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR. MISS IN WITH SEIU. IF ANY RIGHT WITH US EIGHT CALIFORNIA THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEMS IN NURSING HOMES AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO RE AUTHORIZE IT IN A WAY THAT PRIORITIZES THE RELENTLESS WORK OF CARE GIVERS AND THE THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS THAT RELY ON THEM FOR SAFE AND LONG TERM CARE. SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN REPRESENTS TWENTY THOUSAND NURSING HOME WORKERS IN A VARIETY OF POSITIONS IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE PANDEMIC AND FOR YEARS HAVE EXPERIENCE PERSISTENTLY LOW WAGES LIMITED BENEFITS AND A DANGEROUS WORKPLACE THE REAUTHORIZATION OF AB SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES. AND WE ARE EAGER TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM INTO A TRULY QUALITY BASED ONE. MANY'S NETWORKERS ARE BURNT OUT THEY'RE BURNT OUT FROM UNDERSTAFFING NOT BEING VALUED AND PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO CARE FOR STATES VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE DURING THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT NEW FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO HAVE FACED THESE CHALLENGES LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE REFORMED SO AS WE DISCUSSED FINANCING REFORM WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES THAT NOT ONLY AFFECT THE LIVES OF WORKERS AND RESIDENTS BUT ALSO HOLDS AND IF INDUSTRY- ACCOUNTABLE FIRST SPENDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY INCLUDING MAKING TARGETED INVESTMENTS TOWARD WORK FOR STABILITY WHICH WILL IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF CARE. WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION SHOULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE METHODOLOGY AND INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE WORKFORCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF RESIDENT CARE. THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEM IS THAT THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY DOES NOT FULLY REIMBURSED LABOR COSTS OF NURSING AND SUPPORT STAFF. NOR DOES IT ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT TO IMPROVE WORK FOR STABILITY. RATE INCREASES HAVE BEEN GIVEN READILY TO FACILITIES WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO RAISING WAGES BENEFITS OR INVESTING IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE PROPOSE A FEW SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPROVE QUALITY THROUGH ENHANCED DIRECT AND INDIRECT KERR LABOR COST REIMBURSEMENT AND INCENTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM REMEMBERS DIRECT AND INDIRECT KERR LABOR UP TO THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE AND NON LABOR COSTS LIKE SUPPLIES- AT THE SEVENTY FIFTH PERCENTILE. THERE IS ALSO A COST CNTAINMENT MECHANISM KNOWN AS THE GLOBAL CAP. THAT REDUCES OFFICE YLIDES PER DIEM RATES IF OVERALL SPENDING PROJECTIONS IF THE EXCEED THE STATUTORY. IS GIVEN THE STATUTORY CAP. WE KNOW OTHERS ARE PROPOSED MOVING THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT KERR LABOR PERCENTILE TO THE 100% TILE BUT THIS WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SINCE THE GLOBAL CAP IS IMPOSED AFTER FACILITY SPECIFIC PER DIEM RATES ARE CALCULATED. THE GLOBAL CAP REDUCTION IMPOSES A GREATER BURDEN ON FACILITIES THAT SERVE A HIGHER POP PROPORTION OF MEDICARE RESIDENTS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXEMPT DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARE COST FROM THE GLOBAL CAPTAIN MAINTAIN THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE CAP ON LABOR COSTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MOST FACILITIES THAT HAVE LABOR BECAUSE ABOVE THE NINETY FIVE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE SERVE LESS MEDICARE RESIDENTS THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. THIS APPROACH WILL PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN THE WORK FORCE BY ALLOWING MORE FACILITIES TO BE AND REIMBURSE FOR A LARGER PORTION OF THEIR LABOR COSTS. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL THAT THE STATE ADDRESSES THE RATE INCREASES THAT FACILITIES HAVE RECEIVED DURING THE PANDEMIC THROUGH AB EIGHTY ONE. SMITH RECEIVED A 10% INCREASE AND MEDICARE RATES TO ASSIST WITH THE- ADDITIONAL COST DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE ESTIMATE THAT EQUATED TO NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION ADDITIONAL. FUNDS TO THESE FACILITIES ALTHOUGH AB EIGHTY ONE REQUIRED THE STATE TO CONDUCT AUDITS NO AUDITS HAVE BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC TO DETERMINE IF THE FUNDS WERE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. SINCE WORKERS PAY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE AND CARE GIVERS ARE LEAVING THE INDUSTRY IN DROVES AT THE STATE AND IF THE STATE INTENDS TO RETAIN THIS EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE DECLARED EMERGENCY PERIOD. IT IS VITAL THAT ONE WE KNOW HOW THE MONEY ALREADY GIVEN TO THE SENATE'S WAS SPENT AND TO- HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS IN PLACE BEFORE FURTHER INCREASES ARE GIVEN. WE PROPOSE THAT THE INCREASE BE REPURPOSED AND REDISTRIBUTED INTO A VOLUNTARY WORK FOR STABILIZATION RATE INCREASE PROGRAM. MODELED AFTER CALIFORNIA'S NET WAGE ADJUSTMENT WAIT PROGRAM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY CMS. FACILITIES WILL APPLY FOR THE RATE INCREASE TO APPROVE BASE WAGES UP 210% OR TWENTY DOLLARS HICHEVER IS HIGHER. PROVIDE STAFF RETENTION BONUSES AND WAGE ENHANCEMENTS FOR COMPLETING ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND EXPAND BENEFITS. FACILITIES WE NEED TO PROVIDE LEGALLY BINDING WRITTEN AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY ALONG WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO RECOUP ANY FUNDS THAT ARE NOT SPENT APPROPRIATELY. THIS TYPE OF PROGRAMWOULD AVOID THE PITFALLS OF WAGE PASS THROUGHS WHICH DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT NURSING HOME WORKERS WAGES WILL INCREASE BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM LACKS THE MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. WE SUPPORT THE STATE'S GOAL TO YOU THE MORE QUALITY BASED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM. THE ACS HAS INDICATED THEY PREFER AT LEAST 40% OF FUTURE RATE INCREASES BEING TIED TO QUALITY PERFORMANCE HOWEVER WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THIS PORTION OF THE FUTURE RATE INCREASE IS DEDICATED TO THE EXISTING COST BASED. METHODOLOGY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO REIMBURSE INCREASE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARE LABOR COSTS AND IF OUR GLOBAL CASH EXEMPTION- IS NOT ADOPTED WILL RESULT IN LARGER RATE REDUCTIONS FOR FACILITIES THAT CARE FOR MOSTLY MEDICARE RESIDENTS. FOR YEARS NEVER HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH RATE INCREASES AND QUALITY PAYMENTS WHILE NEGLECTING TO MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR OPERATIONS ANY SET OF QUALITY METRICS MUST BE WORK FOR CENTURY TO RECOGNIZE THE DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN CARE GIVERS AND QUALITY OF CARE. THERE MUST BE A SET OF STANDARDS THAT EACH SNIFF IS REQUIRED TO MEET BEFORE THEY ARE EVEN CONSIDERED FOR A QUALITY RATE INCREASE A SNIFF THAT HAS A HISTORY OF DANGERS A. AND DOUBLE A. CITATIONS OR THAT IS NOT ABIDING BY CURRENT RAGE LAWS AND ORDINANCES OR THAT FAIL TO PAY THEIR QUALITY ASSURANCE BE. A SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN THE MONEY FROM THE STATE IT'S ALSO CRUCIAL THAT THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS REMAIN SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE DAILY RATE THE CURRENT- QUALITY AND ASSURANCE UP LAMENTO PAYMENT PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS THE COST. STRUCTURE PROVIDES A SEPARATE PAYMENT AND MANY WORKERS ARE ABLE TO SHARE AND THOSE QUALITY BONUS PAYMENTS A FEW OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE PLACIG DOLLAR CAPS ON CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SUCH AS MANAGEMENT AND HOME OFFICE CROSS IN ADDITION TO MAINTAINING THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE COST CENTER CAP AND RESTRUCTURING THE PEER GROUPING SYSTEMS TO BETTER REFLECT SNIFF. RESIDENTS SOCIO ECONOMIC GROWTH RISK FACTORS ADDITION AT LEAN MORE STRINGENT- AUDITS AND RECOUPMENT ARE NEEDED SINCEOUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SEVERAL FACILITIES THAT RECEIVED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MEETING THE MINIMUM STAFFING STANDARDS RECEIVED STAFFING WAIVERS AND SOME ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR STAFFING LEVELS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. BUT OUR AB SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE SOLUTIONS ADDRESS ONLY THE FINANCING ISSUES AND OTHER LONG STANDING ISSUES IN THE NURSING HOME REMAIN WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE INDUSTRY CAN BE BEST ACHIEVED BY INVOLVING WORKERS EMPLOYERS ADVOCATES AND THE GOVERNMENT AND THE STANDARD SETTING PROCESS. THAT CAN HELP EMPOWER WORKERS IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS AND ENSURE THAT STANDARDS ARE LEVEL ACROSS THE INDUSTRY OUR MEMBERS STAND STRONG AND PROUD ALONG SIT ALONGSIDE SENATOR STERN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AS WE PROPOSED TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA'S FIRST SKILLED NURSING FACILITY QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD. CALIFORNIA CAN TRANSFER- NURSING HOMES PER FROM CENTERS TO CARE CENTERS BUT ONLY WHEN WORKERS ARE AT THE ABLE QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD OUR PUBLIC BODIES COMPOSED OF WORKERS EMPLOYEES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. CALIFORNIA'S NET QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD WITH THAT WORK FOR STANDARDS SUCH AS MINIMUM WAGE RATES BENEFITS TRAINING AND MINIMUM STAFFING STANDARDS FOR SNIFF INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO STABILIZE THE WORKFORCE AND IMPROVE RESIDENT CARE QUALITY. THE QUALITY STANDARDS BOARD WILL ALSO AIM TO DECREASE LONGSTANDING RACIAL DISPARITIES AND RESIDENT QUALITY CARE OUTCOMES INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDS CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHERE HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS. THAT PROVIDE GOOD WAGES AND BENEFITS ARE NOT UNDERCUT BY LOW ROAD. OPERATORS THE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE PRESENTED TODAY WILL ADDRESS THE EXISTING DISPARITIES AND THE REIMBURSEMENT WHILE ENHANCING THE DEPARTMENT'S GOAL OF FOCUSING ON QUALITY CARE AND SNIFFS. AS A SHIFT INTO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE SYSTEM. THESE CHANGES FALL IN LINE WITH THE BITE AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT STATE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE STAFFING AND WORK FOR STABILITY SUCH AS TYING MEDICAID PAYMENTS TO NURSING STAFF WAGES AND BENEFITS. INCLUDING ADDITIONAL PAY FOR EXPERIENCE AND SPECIALIZATION IT IS CLEAR THAT BOTH ON A STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY MUST BE UNDERTAKEN TO PROTECT WORKERS RESIDENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES. CAREGIVERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS INDUSTRY AND HAVE ALREADY AND DOOR TO MATCH AND LOST TOO MUCH IT'S TIME TO MAKE MEANINGFUL LONG LASTING CHANGES IN THE FITNESS INDUSTRY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ANTHONY- CHUCKLE TELL STAFF ATTORNEY WITH CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING. HOME REFORM. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS TONY I'M UPSET SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. ALSO KNOWN AS SCANNER. PART OF THE PANDEMIC UNDERSTAFFING WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT JANICE INVOLVES. BUT NOW WHAT HAD BEEN EMBARRASSING IS BEING FEATURED RIGHT NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN THAT CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING SHOULD NEED MORE REVENUE GOING TO NURSING HOMES FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS. THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE CRISIS IS NOT A SHORTAGE OF AVAILABLE WORKERS AND SHORTAGE OF WILLING WORKERS. IT'S A SHORTAGE OF NURSING HOME OPERATORS THE TREE WORKERS AND RESIDENTS FAIRLY. ISIS IS IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE CARE AND THE CONDITIONS OF WORK. THE FRAMING OF THE ISSUE HAS BEEN MISLEADING. IT IS IF WE THROW A PARTY AND PROMISED EVERYONE HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME MACINNES OR FOOD OR DRINKS THERE'S NO MUSIC THERE'S NO BUTTONS AND THE CONVERSATION IS GUARANTEED TO BE BORING. LET NO ONE SHOWS UP AND WE ASK. A DOZEN ANYONE LIKE PARTIES ANYMORE. WORKING IN A NURSING HOME IS THE OPPOSITE OF A PARTY THESE DAYS. WHEN PEOPLE ARE STAYING AWAY. OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON MAKING WORK CONDITIONS BETTER MAKING THE WORK A CALL IN A WAY THEY CAN ACT A WAY TO HELP AND NOT FEEL OVERWHELMED AND UNDER APPRECIATED. ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. CANTOR 1100% ENDORSES MORE FINANCING TO SUPPORT NURSING HOME CARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE SEIU QUALITY STANDARDS FOR PROPOSAL IT SOUNDS AMAZING. WHAT IS CONCERNED IS FOR DECADES IS THAT DESPITE THE INCREASED SPENDING YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY CARE STUBBORNLY DOES NOT IMPROVE. WHAT ARE WE DOING. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE PROMISED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR PROMISED TO MAKE NURSING HOME CARE BETTER FOR RESIDENTS AND WORKERS MORE EQUITABLE BUT REALLY THE ONLY TWO THINGS IT IS PRODUCED ARE BILLION OUR OPERATORS AND RECORD LEVELS OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. THE STATE IS GETTING PLAYED. ARE WE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH. WITHOUT AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE CANNOT REALLY KNOW. WE DO KNOW THAT NURSING HOMES ARE EXPERTS IN HIDING MONEY PRIMARILY THROUGH RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WHERE THEY SET UP. RELATED COMPANIES JUNE OUTSOURCED SERVICES IN A THEMSELVES. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NEW YORK IS INSTRUCTIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY NEW YORK PASSED A LAW SIMILAR TO THIS YEAR'S AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE. THAT WOULD BE HEARD TOMORROW IN THE ASSEMBLY- COMMITTEE. IN THIS NEW YORK LAW REQUIRES 70% OF ALL NURSING REVENUES TO BE SPENT ON DIRECT CARE. IN THIS LAWSUIT THAT WAS FILED VERY RECENTLY. TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT NURSING HOMES SUED THE STATE OF NEW YORK TO STOP THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS 70% SPENDING REQUIREMENTS. IN THEIR COMPLAINT WITH THE SAUDIS REPORTED EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE MINIMUM CARE. THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS HER NURSING HOME DIVERTED TO PURPOSES NOT CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTER OF THE- ELECTIVELY THAT EQUALS TENS OF MILLIONS. OF CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT HOURS. ONE MEDIA SOURCE CALLED THIS LAWSUIT THE MAGNA CARTA OF NURSING HOME DEBAUCHERY. SKINNER IS ONE OF FOURTEEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT TOGETHER WROTE TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING OUR NURSE FINANCING SYSTEM. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY'S HEARING STARTING ON PAGE THIRTY FOUR. SINCE WE SENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO DH CS IN NOVEMBER WE'VE NOT RECEIVED ANY RESPONSE. YOU'RE THE RESIDENTS WILL BE RELEGATED TO THE SIDELINES ONCE AGAIN AS THE STATE IN THE INDUSTRY COME UP WITH THE POLICY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THIS IS SUPREMELY FRUSTRATING. OUR SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE GET. PROFITABILITY HAS NOT BEEN ALIGNED WITH QUALITY. AND TO ADDRESS CHAIRPERSON ARAMBULA OPENING COMMENT WE HAVE IGNORED RESIDENTS TO SOME DEGREE WE BIG NOR. WE HAVE WE CERTAINLY HAVE NOT IGNORE RESIDENTS WITH OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WHAT WE REALLY NEED NORD IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE WANT ANY ENFORCEMENT THAT WE NEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JENNIFER SNYDER THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I AM REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND- SPEAK TO YOU REGARDING THAT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY MEDICO RATE SETTING FORMULA AND IT'S RE AUTHORIZATION- THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH FACILITY STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE RE AUTHORIZATION THE MEDICARE FUNDING FRAMEWORK FOR NURSING HOMES AND THE ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT OVERALL THIS FRAMEWORK CONTINUES TO ASSURE FACILITY BASED REIMBURSEMENT REWARD FACILITIES FOR QUALITY CARE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR OUR STATE'S NURSING FACILITY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE WERE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST PROVIDERS TO PROPOSED TO PAY A QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE. FUND MEDICAL RESEARCH NURSING HOME CARE ALL ELEVEN HUNDRED LICENSED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA TAX THEMSELVES AND GENERATE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WHICH IS MATCH TO FILTER FEDERAL DOLLARS AND PROVIDES ONE BILLION IN TOTAL REVENUES EVERY YEAR. CAST MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT MEDICARE RATES SYSTEM IS WORTH OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT HOWEVER DUE TO THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE CODEPENDENT MAKE AND AS WE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE WORK FOR SHOWED SHORTAGES WE ALSO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE MEDICARE RATE NEEDS TO BE REFLECTIVE. OF GROWING PATIENT CARE COST AND SUPPORTS AND ADDRESS DRYER STAFFING NEEDS AND LONG TERM CARE. NURSING FACILITIES WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN NURSING STAFF ESPECIALLY CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT. THE COBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER DECIMATED THIS CARE GIVER WORK FORCE TO CRISIS PROPORTIONS NAY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CARE GIVERS BUT THE LONG TERM CARE PROFESSION JUST IN CALIFORNIA FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND INFORMATION H. CAI ESTIMATES THAT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED C. N. A.'S LEFT THE PROFESSION. SO THAT'S JUST FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN WITHOUT NECESSARY STAFF NURSING FACILITIES ARE FORCED TO REDUCE THEIR CENSUS WHICH IS THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN IN OVER TWENTY YEARS. AT 78% BENDS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE. FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS IN NEED A PLACEMENT. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WE KNOW- A 100% GOVERNMENT FUNDED WITH ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR OF FUNDING COMING FROM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE REST USUALLY AROUND 20% CUT EXCLUSIVELY FOR MEDICARE. AT SIXTY SIX AVERAGE MEDICAL PATIENT CENSUS NURSING HOMES ARE ONLY PAID 53% OF THEIR COSTS BY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ANOTHER WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS UNDERFUNDING IS TO COMPARE RATES LET'S SAY BETWEEN NURSING FACILITY CARE AND IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE MEDICARE REIMBURSES THE AVERAGE NURSING FACILITY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. AND THAT IS SUPPOSED TO PRIDE RESIDENT WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT SERVICES THEY NEED AND THEY DESERVE. CALIFORNIA PAYS AN AVERAGE I DOLLARS A DAY AND WE WOULD SAY THAT STILL ISN'T ENOUGH FOR THE HSS WORKER. BUT THAT COVERS AN EIGHT HOUR SHIFT IN SOMEONE'S HOME IT DOESN'T COVER NURSING CARE MEALS UTILITIES RENT FULL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THAT A NURSING HOME- PROVIDES. AT RIGHT NOW AN AVERAGE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY. THE MEDICARE RATE IS TWICE THE MEDICAL RATE AT THE LOW END AND AT THE HIGH END WHICH INCLUDES THERAPY SERVICES IT'S UPWARDS OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS TO PROVIDING SERVICES TO MEDICARE PATIENT BUT IT IS GOVERNMENT FUNDS THAT ULTIMATELY DICTATE WHAT RESOURCES CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PAY ADEQUATE STAFF WAGES. AND SUPPORT QUALITY PATIENT CARE. THERE ARE THREE KEY ITEMS WHICH WE FEEL MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE SNIFF MEDICARE RATE WE AUTHORIZATION TO ASSURE NURSING FACILITIES CAN RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC AND PROVIDE QUALITY CARE. FIRST NURSING FACILITIES SHOULD REMAIN FUNDED AT THEIR CURRENT MEDICARE RATE THIS INCLUDES THE CODE NINETEEN FUNDS AND THEY'RE ALLOCATED THAT ARE GOING SPECIFICALLY TOWARD STAFFING AND NEEDED PP. MEDICARE PROGRAM IS TO PAY NURSING FACILITIES FOR THEIR FULL LABOR COSTS AND SIMILAR TO WHAT I SEE I YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS MEANS RECOGNIZING THOSE FULL LABOR COSTS NOT THREE YEARS AFTER THE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SETS AS SPENT WHICH IS HOW THEY ARE CALCULATED. AND NOR WITH THE CERTAIN LESSER PERCENTILES THE CAPS THAT SEIU AND THAT- THAT WORD AND THE TOLL BY SEIU OR BUDGETARY ASIDE OUR ADJUSTMENTS. AND LASTLY CAPS SUPPORTS THE STATES EFFORTS ACTUALLY TO RESTRUCTURE PAYMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE QUALITY- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE QUALITY MEASURES REQUIRES OUR TRANSPARENT AND DO NOT DISQUALIFY GOOD PROVIDERS. UP FROM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE DOLLARS. SO CAST MEMBERS ARE INDEBTED TO THEIR STAFF FOR THE CARE THEY PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DIRECT CARE STAFF ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE FACILITY AND PATIENT CARE. THAT'S RIGHT CALF RECENTLY RELEASED A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY REFORM PACKAGE WHICH IS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TODAY- IT INCLUDES FOUR KEY COMPONENTS FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE CALLING IN OUR DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE. REQUIRE FACILITIES TO PAY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO EVERY CNA BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. NOW THIS AS- IS MY ACCOUNT TO PAY TWO THIRDS OF THAT COST BECAUSE THEY PAY TWO THIRDS OF COST OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT THAT. FACILITIES WILL KICK IN THE REST AND THAT REQUIREMENT WILL GO THE DRIVES TO TWENTY FIVE. AND WE'RE ASKING FOR A CONTINUED STRONG INVESTMENT IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT MAKING SURE WE BUILD ON WHAT THE SUB COMMITTEE DID LAST YEAR- AND INFESTED FUNDS AND CNA TRAINING WE WANT TO SEE THAT CONTINUE AND TO. GET BIGGER- WE'RE SUPPORTING ENHANCE REGISTERED NURSING CARE IN OUR SMALLER BUILDINGS MOVING MANY OF A FACILITY STARRING CARE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. AND LASTLY CALF SUPPORTS A SIFF EVIDENCE BASED STAFFING STUDY TO DETERMINE WHAT STAFFING NEEDS ARE REQUIRED. FOR LONG TERM CARE FOR THE LONG TERM CARE A PROFESSION POST PANDEMIC ARE WHAT ARE NEEDED ALONG WITH A FULLY FUNDED MEDICARE RATE REIMBURSEMENT. SYSTEM FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE THAT ALREADY SECURELY IN PLACE. AND THAT FULLY FUNDS FACILITY COSTS FOR LABOR AND THEN WE LOOK AT OUR DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE IN THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE- WE BUILD OUR WORK FORCE AND WE SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE. TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE. I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT CASTRO WE SUPPORTS COST AND RESOURCE TRANSPARENCY FOR NURSING HOMES. NOW WE ALL OF HER THAT THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM ALREADY AUDITS ALL COSTS INCURRED. BY A NURSING FACILITY DISALLOWING ANY UNAUTHORIZED FUNDS. THAT CAP IS STILL OPEN TO ANY ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OR SAFEGUARDS RELATED TO THOSE FUNDS AND ANYTHING ELSE WE THINK. IS NEEDED TO BETTER ADDRESS- THAT AUDIT PROCESS. LEGISLATION WAS PASSED LAST YEAR WITH. IT WAS SB SIX FIFTY IS IT- SENATOR STERN BILL WHICH CALF WORK WITH THE AUTHORED SPONSORS TO MOVE TO A NEUTRAL POSITION. IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSING FACILITIES INCLUDING DETAILED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTS. DISCLOSURES OF RELATED AND UNRELATED PARTIES AND FULL DISCLOSURE INCOME EXPENSES AND ARE PRETTY SURPLUS. AND DEFICITS AND THAT ALL GOES TO LEARN NEW. ARSHAD H. CHI- AND WE HOPE THAT STARTS BY NEXT YEAR. EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT MEDIC. IS NURSE. TO BE FOUND ON THE H. K. H. WEBSITE PROCESS ASSURES THAT PHYLLIS FACILITIES ARE NOT ONLY PAID A PERCENTAGE ARE ONLY PAID A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEIR. THAT MEDICARE PROGRAMS DO NOT PRODUCE PROCESS PROFITS BUT RATHER UNDER FUND COST OF SERVICES. IN NURSING HOMES. AS I MENTIONED THE MEDICARE RATE IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE MEDICARE RATE. AND THIS RATE STILL REPRESENTS REALLY ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF PATIENTS IN NURSING HOMES NURSING HOMES DO YOU SOME OF THESE FUNDS TO BACK FILL THE LOW MEDI CAL RATES. BUT ALSO THE ALSO MISUSE THIS FUNNY PROVIDE MEDICARE PATIENTS MORE COMPLEX NURSING THERAPY SERVICES AND ACUTE REHAB. FOR RECOVERY TO RETURN HOME. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE MINISTRATION LEGISLATURE ON A STRONG MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FORMULA FOR NURSING HOMES THAT FULLY SUPPORTS LABOR COSTS AND INCENTIVIZE QUALITY. CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR ANY MEMBER OF QUESTIONS- SEEING NONE AT THE MOMENT I WILL BEGAN AYE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION- WHY WE STILL DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL- OBVIOUSLY FOR MANY OF US WE WERE SYMPATHETIC AS THE PANDEMIC HELPED TO SLOW DOWN MANY PROPOSAL. HELLO HOWEVER LAST YEAR DH CS HAD COMMITTED TO ENGAGING IN A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. THIS LAST FALL TO DEVELOP THE PROPOSAL AND YET WE HAVE NOT HEARD OF SUCH A PROCESS OCCURRING NOR DO WE HAVE THE PROPOSAL. I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK SINCE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY IS NOT INHERENTLY LOOKING TO EXTEND. THE EXISTING PROGRAM FOR OTHER HERE. BUT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE SUFFICIENT TIME TO IT WAIT. A COME. AND THAT IS WE WILL HAVE TO DO. HOPING YOU PROVIDE A UNDER OF ONE WE WILL HAVE AN EXPECTATION TO RECEIVE THAT PROPOSAL. WHEN YOU HEARING TO MAKE IT RIGHT THE DEPARTMENT WE ARE WORKING TO FINALIZE THAT PROPOSAL AS DILIGENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER PARK PARTNERS- AND WE WILL CAN COMMIT THAT THERE WILL BE A PROPOSAL. BY THE MAY REVISION. HAVING TO BUY THE MAY REVISION MAKES IT AWFULLY TOUGH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND IN A MEANINGFUL TIME AND SO WE JUST ASK THE ADMINISTRATION- TO REMEMBER THAT COMMITMENTS TATE TOWARDS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND TO- LIVE UP TO IT IS I BELIEVEIT'S IMPORTANT. TO HAVE ALL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THEIR VOICE BE HEARD IN THIS PROCESS- I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP MISTER ERRINGTON IF I COULD WE'VE RECENTLY INCREASED- LABOR COSTS FROM 90% 295% TAKES STILL WOULD FOR WHY WE ARE NOT- REIMBURSING OUT A HUNDRED. PERCENT I'M HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME CLARITY TO THAT. SURE YOU WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR I MEAN WE HAVE HELD A PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER MEETING AS WELL AS MATT WITH MULTIPLE- GROUP STATE TO CONTINUE THAT STAKEHOLDER AND ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SO WE HAVE- CONDUCTED A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND ARE CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THAT- RELATIVE TO THE RAISING OF THE- NINETY FIFTH PERSON FROM THE NINETY. FROM NINETY TO NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE REALLY THAT WAS SPEAK TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE CAPTURING- THE APPROPRIATE COST AND AGAIN THAT WE ARE SAYING THAT ALL LABOR COST UP TO THAT NINETY IF IT FIFTH PERCENTILE ARE INCLUDED SO FOR FACILITIES COSTS WERE BELOW THAT NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE. THEIR TOTAL COSTS ARE INCLUDED SO IT'S JUST REALLY FOR THOSE OUT LIAR pFACILITIES THAT MAY HAVE- HIGHER COSTS AND I WAS- JUST WOULDN'T- TESTIFY TO YOU THAT IS GENERALLY YOU OF THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE LOW MEDIC HOW- PARTICIPATION- AND SO THOSE ARE KIND. OF OUT LIAR REAP WAGES. FOLLOWING UP ON WITH MY WHAT MAY GLOBAL TAP CAN YOU PROVIDE THE RATIONALE FOR WHY WE MAINTAIN THAT AND- IF THERE IS- FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO ADDRESS THAT. SO OF COURSE IN THE GLOBAL CAP IS INCLUDED AS PART OF. THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT THE ANNUAL RATE INCREASE WILL BE FOR THE FACILITIES AND HAS I'VE MENTIONED WE ARE LOOKING AT- I'VE JUST SEEN THAT- HAVE AS PART OF- THE PROPOSAL THAT THAT IS COMING FORWARD BY SEPARATING OUT LABOR AND NON LABOR COSTS. AND BUT BUT YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME FIDUCIARY. RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE REASONABLE RATES MOVING FORWARD- WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TRANSITION TO THE WORK FORCE ON PAGE THIRTY TWO- WE HEAR THAT. THE NURSING INDUSTRY HAS LOST SIXTEEN THOUSAND WORKERS SINCE TWENTY TWENTY THAT THAT ACCOUNTS TO ELEVEN POINT 3% OF THE ENTIRE WORK FORCE HAVE WE REPLACED THE TWENTY. IT SEEMS THAT WE WERE ON A WHOLE BACK THEN ARE WE DIGGING IT DEEPER HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF THIS WHOLE- WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT ARE SHORT AND OUR LONG TERM PLANS ARE TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. THIS IS. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT TO THE BROAD- WORK FORCE AND THAT DOES NOT FALL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES UNFORTUNATELY. I WOULD HOPEFULLY REMIND THE ADMINISTRATION THAT A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR CARA KANEMI. PROPOSAL AND WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD FIND ROOM TO ENSURE THAT WORK FORCE FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WAS INCLUDED IN THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO- I AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT- FOR US TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE WE NOT WE MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE. AND THAT MUST START WITH HAVING SUFFICIENT WORKFORCE IN PLACE- AND SO WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP ON HOW WE HAVE BOTH THE- SHORT AND LONG TERM PLAN FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS AS THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING. WE CAN SOLVE ANY ONE BUDGET YEAR BUT WILL NEED A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT PARTNERSHIP AND- COORDINATION. I'D LIKE TO- FOLLOW UP IF I CAN ON SOME OF THE WAIVERS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN- ALLOWABLE. AND AM- IF THAT HI- SOME OF THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES THAT WE REALLY HAVE AND A WAR. EXACERBATES SOME OF THE BURN OUT FROM THE WORKERS WHO ARE SHOWING UP- WHEN WE ARE- CONTINUING THOSE- WAIVERS AND I'M HOPING TO HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF THERE'S- A PLAN FOR US TO ADDRESS THOSE WAIVERS AS- AS I BELIEVE IT. WILL BE IN. A FOR US TO FOCUS ON THE WORK FORCE FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW OFTEN FACILITIES ARE USING THOSE WAIVERS. THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR A COMMENT FROM YOU ON- WHAT THE THOUGHT IS ON WAIVERS GOING FORWARD. MICHELLE POTTS I JUST STEPPING ON THIS QUESTION SO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROCESSES THAT A TWO POINT FOUR THREE POINT FIVE OF THE WORK FORCE AND- AND ACUITY WAIVER SO I THINK IT'S BEST FOR THEM TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT TO YOUR YOUR QUESTION EARLIER ON WORK. AND MENTIONING THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION YOU KNOW THERE'S DOLLARS IN THEIR PARTICULARRELATED TO NURSING SOCIAL WORKER IN PSYCHIATRIC- I WORKFORCE I THINK ALL COULD TOUCH ON BUILDING OUT THAT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WORKFORCE IN THE FUTURE SO. I WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH- EACH CRY AS THOSE EFFORTS ARE STILL UNDERWAY. I WILL THANK YOU DIRECTOR BOSTON AYE- REALLY. ENJOYED THAT THE LEGISLATURE TOOK A LEADERSHIP ROLE LAST YEAR. TO INVEST IN TO WORK FORCE AND- REALLY WANTS TO PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THIS YEAR TO ENSURE WERE- CREATING A PLAN GOING FORWARD- I. WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IF I CAN- AS WE ARE- TRANSITIONING TO MANAGED CARE PLANS CARVING THIS IN AS AN L. T. S. S- HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE. THAT WE DON'T TRANSITION PEOPLE FROM NURSING HOMES INTO A COMMUNITY BASED CARE WHICH MANY OF US ACKNOWLEDGES OUR DEFAULT PREFERENCE. BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NOT PUSHING PEOPLE FROM OUR SNAPS. WHO ACTS ARE PUSHING PEOPLE TO THE COMMUNITY BASED CARE WHO ACTUALLY WILL NEED SNIFF CARE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO REDUCE COSTS WHAT TYPES OF MECHANISMS ARE WE LOOKING AT AND EVALUATING TO ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT OCCUR. I WOULD NOTE THAT- AS PART OF THE NURSING HOMES MUST COMPLETE IT AND YES SECTION Q. WHICH GOES THROUGH A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS TO THE RESIDENT ASKING THEIR PREFERENCE I THINK THAT INFORMATION WILL BE ONE ONE I'M ACTIVISM TO ENSURE THAT. RESIDENTS HAVE A CHOICE IN WHERE THEY WANT TO RECEIVE CARE AND KIND OF THE LEVEL OF CARE THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. USING THAT INFORMATION AND MONITORING THAT I THINK WOULD BE ONE AVENUE TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO MADE ME MOVE. SERVICE HAS HAD. TO DO THAT. THIRTEEN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I GUESS I JUST MISSED HERRINGTON- DO YOU CONSIDER THE LEGISLATURE A STAKEHOLDER. WE DO CONTACTED. IT IS THERE A REASON FOR THE A MISSION. YOU KNOW I MEAN WE HELD A OF RIDE IT STAKEHOLDER MEETING ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION OF THE COST PROGRAM AS REQUIRED AND IT WAS PUBLICIZED. BUT BUT NOW WE HAVE NOT HAD A SEPARATE INTERACTION. WELL MY ADVICE TO YOU IS IF YOU DON'T GIVE US SOMETHING SOON WANTED TO SAID WANTED TO RELEASE IT JUNE SIXTEENTH. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN WOULD YOU CONSIDERING. HOW'S THAT TIME LINE SOUND TO YOU. SO I'M HAPPY TO STEP IN HERE WENDY I'M COMPLETELY EGGNOG GENE YOUR COMMENTS ON THIS YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION HAS GONE THE PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO YOU I'M GIVING YOU A PROPOSAL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I CONTINUE WITH DAVID ACT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE DEDUCTED AS MY CALENDAR. THAT DIDN'T IN MY TIME WHEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OF YESTERDAY BECAUSE MY STAFF HOW THEY- REACT TO THAT. SO I DON'T GET A PROPOSAL. SO IS A SINCE POSSIBLE. I THINK WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING US WHEN HE SAID- NO LATER THAN MAY REVISE IT WE'RE WORKING IT'S USUALLY. NOT ALREADY TOLD ME REVISED TO LATE DON'T SUBMIT THEM. WE HAVE ANOTHER DATE. I CAN GIVE YOU ONE ARE TODAY BUT I WILL COMMIT TO YOU ARE ENGAGING WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS- YOU WE CONTINUE TO HAVE EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS AND WE'LL GET YOU SOMETHING I DID THAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS AFTER THAT RELEASE IN THE FUTURE AND APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT. COMMITTEE YOU THAT. ONE MINUTE I THOUGHT IT. EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO NOT IT OF MY COMMAND THE DEMONSTRATING A COMPLETE LACK OF DESIRE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ARE ITS COMPLETE LACK OF DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS IS VERY. SERIOUS ISSUE WE SAW DURING KOBE ED HOW MANY DEATHS OCCURRED IN NURSING QUESTIONS. BUT IF- YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. THEN CLEARLY. WE'LL HAVE TO PUNT UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHICH IS VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT'S A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FROM ALL THE OPERATORS FROM THE EMPLOYEES FROM THE PATIENTS. SO I THINK WE'RE WAITING FOR ENGAGEMENT BUT I DON'T THINK WE'VE- BEEN CONTACTED ABOUT A MEETING OR- ANY DISCUSSION TO SOLICIT WHAT ARE OPINION OR FEEDBACK IS. I'M SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WE ARE TAKING THIS PROPOSAL EXTREMELY I'M SERIOUSLY HERE WE HAVE BEEN FULLY ENGAGED IN THIS AREA FOR A LONG- AN EXTENSIVE TIME YOU'VE BEEN HAVING- EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH- STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CAP AS HE ARE YOU AND OTHERS- AND WE WILL WORK TO GET SOMETHING TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY YEAH- OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE. I'M A STUDENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BUT I JUST WANT TO HOW A CRITICAL WE THINK THIS IS WE HAVE BEEN A DRIVING TO AND NOT THE QUALITY IS EMBEDDED INTO THE RATES THAT WE PAY IN THAT IT IMPROVES THE OUTCOMES FOR OUR- INDIVIDUALS AND BENEFICIARIES- IN MEDICARE AND WE ARE I CONTINUE TO BE ADDED TO. IN BEING. PASSED WE CAN. GET YOU KNOW FOR I'LL COME STATE MEETING HAVE YOU HEARD. WHEN THE I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO YOUR REGARDS TO STATE MEETINGS YOU'VE BEEN FOR THE LICENSE THE THREE TWELVE MONTHS AND FIFTEEN. AND OVER THOSE TWELVE FIFTEEN WERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE INVITED. ARE YOU LEGISLATIVE STAFF STAKEHOLDER MEETING INCLUDED AT LUNCH LEGISLATIVE STAFF BUT I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AS WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES CD PH PARTNERS ON ESTABLISHING THAT MEETING IN AND THERE WAS ONE OUT OF THE TWELVE MEETINGS. YES THROUGH THE REASON THAT YOU DECIDED TO IGNORE THE LEGISLATURE. PERHAPS YOU DON'T REALLY NEED OUR SUPPORT. REALLY WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS AN IMPORTANT PARTNER AND I MEAN WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE AND HAVE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LIKES OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE LAPTOP ON THE STRUGGLE IT IS A VERY TECHNICAL AND LOTS OF DATA BEHIND SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WHICH IS. WHICH IS SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THERE BEEN SOMEONE OFF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS SOME OF OUR TECHNICAL CONVERSATIONS AND THE PROPOSAL THAT WORK WE'RE THINKING THROUGH IS A SAME PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD. A SIMILAR TOOK TO LAST YEAR- AND IN THE PAST SO THAT IT'S KIND OF THE BUILDING BONE OF A WE'RE THINKING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT OF DIRECTOR I WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE DISAGREE WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW IT'S A IT'S SORT OF-LIKE IF. YOU DON'T INVITE ANYBODY TO THE PARTY CLEARLY YOU DON'T CARE OF. CARE ABOUT THEIR OPINION. SO IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY DESIRE FOR ANY INTEREST TO ENGAGE OR DISCUSS OR TO SOLICIT OPINIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IN MY IN MY MISSING SOMETHING. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT LEGISLATIVE STAFF WERE INVITED TO ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND SO I MEAN I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT OVERLOOKED ON THIS TEAM CONVERSATIONS. WELL I GUESS GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY I COULD A SECOND CENTRIST AND HOW ONE MEETING COULD JUST SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE AND YET YOU ONLY INVITED US TO ONE MEETING. SO IS IT A SIMPLE ISSUE IS A COMPLEX ISSUE I'M I'M KIND OF CONFUSED. IT IS DEFINITELY A COMPLEX ISSUE THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF DISCUSSION BUT A LOT OF WORKING FOR SOME OF THE DETAILS. I CAN. I COMPLETED SO I THOUGHT THAT I COMPLETELY CONCUR WITH YOU. ABOUT WHAT I'M UNDERSTOOD FRONTRUNNER JUST AS HOW CAN WE HAVE BEEN INVITED TO ANY OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. EXCEPT FOR ONE OF THE FUNDS ARE THERE IS ONE OF THEM. THAT WE WERE INVITED TO. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT KIND OF THE DETAILS OF THE STATE CULTURAL I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WERE PREPARED WITH THE LISTING OF ALL THE CONVERSATIONS TODAY- TO TALK THROUGH THIS WITH YOU. NO I'M JUST ASKING WHY WERE WE INVITED ANY THE CONVERSATIONS. BUT ENOUGH FOR A THE DETAILED MINUTES FOR ALL FIFTEEN. I THINK WE JUST YEAH I HAVE TO GET BACK TO ONE KIND OF ALL THE MEETINGS THAT OCCURRED IN WHO WAS INVITED TO WHICH MEANS I I'M NOT. I DON'T I'M NOT TRACKING THE DETAILS OF ALL THE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS- COULD YOU TELL US AT LEAST GIVE US A BROAD BRUSHSTROKE WHO'S INVITED TO THE MEETINGS. WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S INVITED SINCE WE'VE BEEN EXCLUDED. WE CAN. DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT INFORMATION. THE REASON WHY NOBODY FROM STAFF IS PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT. THAT AT THIS PRESENTATION. I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE LIST FROM THE FROM THE LARGE AND STAKEHOLDER MEETING THAT WE HELD ABOUT WHO. WHO WHO YOU INVITED TO THE SMALL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS BECAUSE CHRIS CLEARLY WERE INVITED TO THE BIG ONE SO WE KINDA KNOW. WHO'S IN THE BIG ONE WHO ARE WHO ARE. WHO WHO ARE IN THE OTHER SECRET. THE MAIN GROUPS THAT WE MET WHEN I FIRE AT SEA ARE YOU HAVE CANNER AND- OR OR MAIN FOCUS AS WELL AS OUR- PARTNERS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. SO EVERYBODY WHO'S TESTIFYING HERE TODAY EXCEPT FOR US. I MEAN GENERALLY WE- DON'T INVITE LEGISLATIVE STAFF MEMBERS TO IT TO THOSE TYPES OF MEETINGS AND BE- COORDINATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL WHEN IT'S PRESENTED TO- I I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE. ASSEMBLY COORDINATION WHEN YOU JUST SENATE'S PROPOSALS CALLED FUNDING THE PROPOSAL NOT A COORDINATION I GUESS. BUT IT'S OKAY I MEAN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS THIS TO THE FOREFRONT WE CAN WE CAN YOU KNOW ANSWER I WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT NO NEED TO. SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON SOMETHING THAT MAY BE NIPPING AND I CONSIDER THE SHIFT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET. FROM THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS- YOU KNOW GOING TO- JUST THE- DISSOCIATION IF WE COULD- I- YOU KNOW IN THE AGENDA WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM I SEE YOU ARE FOUR POINTS WHICH I FOUND WAS INTERESTING- FOR CALF- UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE. THE YOU'RE ASKING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO IN TERMS OF MORE MONEY MORE TRAINING- MORE INVESTMENTS I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE ASSOCIATION'S GOING. FIVE I EIGHT TO RESPOND YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT SOME OF THEM RETAIN I THINK- OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR ASSOCIATION ARE DOING MANY MANY THINGS WE BELIEVE TO RESPOND- AND TO TRY TO GROW- BACK OUR WORK FORCE AND SUPPORT OUR PATIENTS- I THINK FOR MOST OF OUR FOLKS- EVERY DAY. IS A DAY WERE BIGGER BURKE I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PROVIDE QUALITY PATIENT CARE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET MORE OF FOLKS TO COME WORK IN THEIR BUILDINGS- AND TRYING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN AS MANY FOLKS AS THEY CAN- IT'S A STRUGGLE FOR ALL OF THEM- THE ASSOCIATION ITSELF I THINK IT IS- IS IN THE MIDDLE OF FIRST YOU KNOW THEY'VE- THEY'VE- ACTUALLY HAVE THIS PROPOSAL. WHICH THEY'RE COMMITTING TO MAKING SURE THAT THEY'LL MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW WITH A DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO INCREASING WAGES FOR THEIR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS- THEY MANY OF OUR- FACILITIES OF STEPPED UP TO DO MORE TRAINING PROGRAMS- AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE LOCAL- LABOR EXPERTISE- AND OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE DOING WORKFORCE TRAINING THEY'RE VERY. THEY'RE TRYING THEIR BEST TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE TO DO THAT- CALF IN AN OF ITSELF HAS DONE A TON OF OUTREACH TO ITS MEMBERS OF BOTH DURING THE PANDEMIC MAKING SURE THAT WE COULD PROVIDE EVERY SUPPORT SERVICES IF THEY COULD FOR THEIR AND- FOR THEIR MEMBERS- TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE PERTINENT PANDEMIC EVERY. YOU KNOW TIME THERE. IMPORT ISSUE OR THINGS THAT CHANGED OR ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM C. PH I THINK IT WAS A IT WAS A REALLY HARD TIME FOR IT FOR EVERYBODY. I'M IN SO I THINK THE ASSOCIATION IN OF ITSELF WANTS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF SUPPORTING ITS MEMBERS. TOWARDS MOVING TOWARDS QUALITY- I THINK. MOST OF OUR FOLKS FEEL LIKE EVERYDAY IS A STRUGGLE TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME- AND MAKING SURE THAT GOT THE RIGHT PEOPLE WORKING FORM SO. HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION AS WELL AS I COULD. APPRECIATE THAT IN TERMS OF BY BY GUESS MY QUESTION IS. SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE THE MEDICARE RATES WILL WILL. DISSOCIATION BE DOING ANY WAGE INCREASES ARE NOT COMPLETE DEPEND ON MEDICARE. SO IT IS MEDIC COW IS- A PRIMARY FUNDER- SO THERE ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT REPRESENTS I MEAN AT LEAST THE MEDICARE PROGRAM REPRESENTS TWO THIRDS OF THAT SO- WE CAN'T WE WOULD SAY IT CAN'T BE DONE WITHOUT IT. NOW THERE WERE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND CONTINUE WITH THE TEN PERCENT- RATE ADJUSTMENT THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. AND FACILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE THOSE FUNDS BOTH FOR AND WAGE INCREASES AND INFECTION CONTROL PP. MANY IF NOT MOST OF OUR FACILITIES UTILIZE THOSE ADDED FUNDS TO INCREASE WAGES FOR PROVIDE BONUSES OR RECRUITMENT RETENTION TYPES OF PROGRAMS FOR THEIR- THIRD FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES SO I CAN SAY IN MANY CASES NURSING FACILITIES I'VE ALREADY RACED REACHES- TO TRY TO ADDRESS ON THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES AND KEEP THEIR FOCUS- A WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC- SO. ON IF FIRST I WOULD SAY THAT THAT FOR THE MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM DOES HAVE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE FUNDS. TO PAY FOR INCREASES IN WAGES BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT TWO THIRDS OF THE FUNDING FOR NURSING FACILITIES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE NURSING FACILITIES ARE GOING TO KICK IN THE OTHER THIRD. AND SO THEY'RE SAYING LOOK WE'LL COMMIT. TO RAISING WAGES BUT WE NEED. OUR GOVERNMENTS OUR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM BECAUSE WE ARE A PARTNER WITH YOU WITH THAT PROGRAM. AND TO HELP US DO THAT AND WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE THAT THE WHIMS MY QUESTION IS YOU YOU SORT OF MADE IT YOUR OF ONE THIRD DEPENDED ON OUR TWO THIRDS AND- IF R. TWO THIRDS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHILE YOU'RE STILL WHAT WERE YOUR ONCE. YOUR SECURE ONE THIRD STILL COMMAND. AND AT AND I WOULD ARGUE ARE ONE THIRD IS ALREADY TRYING. IT'S ALREADY THERE TO SOME EXTENT WITH THE MONIES THAT WERE ALREADY ALLOCATED THROUGH MEDICAL PROGRAM AND ALSO. FACILITIES NEED AND WANT- TO HAVE QUALITY CARE GIVERS IN THEIR BUILDING SO THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND SO I CAN SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY ALREADY DOING THAT PERSONALLY I CAN'T I CAN'T TELL YOU FROM FACILITY FACILITY. THE MITCHELL SMITH WITH WASHINGTON BUT THINK ABOUT THAT STATEMENT THE ONE THIRTY THIRD IN THE WE ARE THE WHICH IS ALREADY THERE. THE WAGES ARE NOT ALREADY THERE. MR NOT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE FOR SURE. THANK THIS IS YOUR NO THEY ARE NOT THERE WHICH IS WHY WE WOULD LIKE THE 10% OF TO BE REPURPOSE BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY AUDITS I THINK WE HEARD FROM DH CS AND ONE OF OUR MEETINGS THAT THEY PROMISED TO GET IT TO US AND- THEY'RE- HOPING THAT THEY KEEP THAT PROMISE SO WE CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT 10% BECAUSE AGAIN. IF THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE POST- THE PANDEMIC WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FIRST CHUNK OF MONEY AND THEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS A CONTINUE SO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IT'S NOT THERE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN. SUCH A THING GOING BACK TO MISS SNYDER SO YOU GOT. YOU GOT THE- THE UNION SAYING THEIR WORKERS AREN'T SEEING IT SO WHERE WORKERS WERE THE MONEY. I THANK THE I THINK WHAT MISS WHITTEN WAS SAYING IS IF THEY HAVE THEY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE FACILITIES HAVE NOT BEEN AUDITED A NOW FACILITIES ARE TRACKING THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO HAVE IT. SO I CAN SAY THAT IN MOST CASES POLICE THAT I TALKED TO I'VE SPOKEN TO THEY UTILIZE THAT MONEY TO PAY MORE FOR WAGES AND TO USE IT FOR BONUS PAYMENTS RECRUITMENT RETENTION- IT LEAST IN THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH NURSING FACILITIES THAT'S WHAT THEY USE THE MONEY FOR. AGAIN MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS NOT. BEEN PROVIDED THE INFORMATION SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUSH A SIMPLE BONUSES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WAGE INCREASES. TRIP SORRY TALKING ABOUT I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING YOUR YOUR YOUR DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE IS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR RIGHT OKAY SO THAT'S A WAGE INCREASE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING YOU BY YOUR LAST STATEMENT IT SAID IT WAS WORRIED THERE SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT THERE IN TERMS OF WAGES BECAUSE WHAT YOU MENTIONED WERE- BONUSES AND RETENTION BONUSES WHICH I THINK ARE ARE WONDERFUL BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT'S NOT A WAGE INCREASE. NO I APOLOGIZE IF I SEEM TO IMPLY THAT. AT THAT THE WAGES WERE ALREADY AT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW OKAY. YOUR ONE THIRD OF THAT DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE WAS A READER THAT'S KIND OF WHERE YOU HAVE. AN INTIMATE OKAY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT AS WELL ALL I CAN SAY IS THE NURSING FACILITIES THAT I HAVE SPOKEN WITH- THEY- HAVE SAID THAT THERE THAT THE MONIES THAT THEY HAVE. THEY'RE USING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN TO GO TOWARDS INCREASED WAGES FOR- OF FOR IN THEIR EMPLOYEES. WHAT CALF IS A TESTING TO IS THE FACT THAT. AGAIN IT IS A GOVERNMENT- NURSING FACILITY PARTNERSHIP THAT. REQUIRES THAT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM INVEST. THE DOLLARS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE TO RAISE THE WAES AND UNTIL THE MEDICARE PROGRAM CAN AT LEAST PAY THE MAJORITY OF WHAT IT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR. NURSING FACILITIES WILL NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO RAISES WAGES. OKAY SO SOUNDS LIKE THE ANSWER'S. NO THAT EVEN IF WE DON'T DO THE TWO THIRDS YOU WON'T KICKING YOUR ONE FOR. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I GET TO TWENTY FIVE CORRECT. OKAY SO IT'S TWO VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID A MINUTE AGO OKAY GOT IT. ARMY SO FROM- THE ADVOCATES THERE'S A LIST OF. ISSUES THAT THEY HIGHLIGHTED I GUESS IT'S ON OF THESE OF THEIR WARS ARE THE STAFF'S REINTERPRETATION OF A WORSE BAND. SELF DEALING SCHEMES TO PREVENT DIVERSION OF PUBLIC FUNDS INTENDED FOR CARE AND STAFFING- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE READ ANY OF THESE BULLETS ON OF THOSE ANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT YOU WOULD AGREE WITH OR- YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WORKING ON. AND IF YOU THE METER READ READ RECITE IT PUTS HERE YOU MIGHT NEED TO YEAH SURE- THAT THE POINTS WERE PROHIBITS AN EXCUSE BILLION PER MY REQUEST IS PROHIBITED- LICENSEES FROM CONTRACTING WITH MANAGEMENT OR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE COMPANIES TO CIRCUMVENT. THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO OPERATE STEPS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL PERMITS. SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE OFTEN BEING USED TO ENRICH OPERATORS BY FUNNELING MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO UNREGULATED ON ACCOUNT. TO BOWL COMPANIES THEY OWN OR CONTROL. LOS NEXT BULLET CLOSE RELATED PARTY LOOPHOLES AT TWENTY TWENTY MINISTRY PEEL DECISION NARROWED THE MEANING OF RELATED PARTY QUORUM COURT RELATED PARTY AND EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES TO HIGH PROFITS AND AVOID TRANSPARENCY. NEXT BULLET IS IMPOSED STRICT CAPS ON RENTS AND LEASE BACK ARRANGEMENTS OPERATION OPERATORS CALMLY CHARGE. INFLATED RATES FOR LEASE PAYMENTS OFTEN USING LAYERS OF SHELL COMPANIES TIE PROFIT TO MAXIMIZE REIMBURSEMENT. NEXT BOYS AND TAX PAYER REIMBURSEMENT FOR WORTHLESS A RELATED PARTY INSURANCE OPERATORS ARE PAYING EXORBITANT PREMIUMS TO THEMSELVES FOR INSURANCE PROVIDED BY RELATED PARTIES. MEMBERS BEFORE INSURANCE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO FAIR MARKET- RATED ONLY FOR POLICIES FROM INDEPENDENT INSURERS THAT PROVIDE ERROR RELIABILITY COVERAGE- BUT A BULLET IS PREVENT TO REIMBURSEMENT OF EXCESSIVE INTEREST RATES NURSING HOMEOWNERS CAN PROFIT A RESIDENTS EXPENSES. BY MAKING LOANS TO NURSING HOME OPERATOR COMPANIES THAT CONTROL EXCESSIVE RATES EVEN THAT'S 10% MORE THIS IS JUST ON PAGE. THIRTY FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. I NO THANK THANK YOU DOCTOR I WOULD HAVE A MUCH EASIER. I'M SORRY I SEE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T BRING YOUR READING GLASSES TO. THANK YOU DR WORK OUR LEMONADE NURSING HOME OWNERSHIP DRAWS. CURRENTLY OWNERS MAY DRAW OR TAKE ANY AMOUNT OF. OUT OF THE NURSING HOME OPERATING BUDGET. AT THE DISCRETION REDUCING AVAILABLE FUNDS AND THEN LASTLY PROHIBIT REIMBURSEMENT OF NURSING HOMES ASSOCIATION DUES NURSING HOME. SO SOLUTIONS ARE BASIC LOBBY ORGANIZATION FOR THE INDUSTRY THEY ARE USED TO SEEK INCREASE STATE FUNDING. FOR STRICTER OVERSIGHT AND DIMINISH ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT PAY FOR THESE TWOS. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS JUST GOING BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS- YOU KNOW IN IN THE THINGS YOU LISTED WERE ALL THINGS THAT YOU WANT OTHER PEOPLE TO DO FOR THE INDUSTRY I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR DOING SUCH TODD JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOUR- COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR BOSS APPRECIATE THAT- AND I APPRECIATE YOU GOING THROUGH THESE NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE THEM IN FRONT OF ME SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFECTIVE. AND SO FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE- THE- CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM SOME OF THEIR- THINGS THEY TALK ABOUT HERE SO I. THINK SOME OF WHAT THEY- ARE RAISING- WE HAVE BEEN PART OF DISCUSSIONS IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT- MUCH OF THIS CAN BE TRANSPARENT GONG FORWARD- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SB SIX FIFTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT HAD A BILL COUPLE THREE YEARS AGO. THAT THAT MAKE SURE NURSING FACILITIES. ARE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT. AS ALL OF THE RELATED PARTIES- ALL OF THEIR AND- ANY ANY OTHER TYPES OF RELATED PARTIES THAT THEY OWN AND WHAT REVENUES GO TOWARDS THOSE PARTIES- SO I WOULD SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST SOME OF WHAT THEY- REYES HERE. WILL BE ADDRESS GOING FORWARD IN THE REPORTING THAT IS REQUIRED AND AGAIN. WE PARTICIPATED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE TRANSPARENCY- AND- ENDED UP GOING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION ON THAT BILL AS WE TALK THROUGH IT WITH THE PROPONENTS INCLUDING CANNER- I THINK- WHEN. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON THE MEDICARE PROGRAM DOES. CLEARLY AUDIT WHERE FUNDS MEDIC MEDICAID FUNDS GO. AND DISALLOW ANY FUNDS THAT RE NOT APPROPRIATE ARE NOT AT MARKET VALUE OR IF THEY DEEMED TO NOT BE A MEDIC CAL DIRECT COST. SO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM HAS AN AUDITING PROGRAM THAT FACILITIES MUST YOU KNOW. PROVIDE CLEAR DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION TO THE PROGRAM AND THEY COME IN ANNUALLY TO ON IT. SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART TO IT BACK TO TRANSPARENCY IN TRACKING THATINFORMATION. I ALSO SAID EARLIER THAT OFF IS OPEN TO OTHER FORMS OF LOOKING AT- TRANSPARENCY WHERE THERE CAN AND SHOULD BE REASONABLE COSTS- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IN. EVERY AREA OF HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE ENTITIES THAT OWN DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT. AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE NURSING FACILITIES- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDER- THEY MIGHT OWN- YOU KNOW A POSSIBLY THE NURSING FACILITY ITSELF BUT THEY ALSO MIGHT OWN A LIP THERAPY COMPANY. AND SO THE PAYMENTS THAT THEY MAKE TO THAT THERAPY COMPANY. SOMETIMES ACTUALLY DO SAVE MONEY- AS OPPOSED TO COST MONEY AND SO I THINK. TO CONSIDER- NURSING FACILITY IS IT ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. ENTITY FOR PURPOSES OF ONLY DIFFERENT COMPANIES I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE ARE TRANSPARENT AND WE'RE OPEN TO ANY. OTHER IS- ANY OTHER IDEAS THE LEGISLATURE HAS SENT TO MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR. WELL SEEMS LIKE FIRST YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE TRANSPARENCY ON YOUR WAGES COULD YOU HAVE THE PERSON REPRESENTING THE LABOR FOR SAYING THAT THEY TURNOUT SAYING THE WAGES- SO ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING IN TERMS OF- RENTS AND LEASE BACKS- INSURANCE CHARGERS- AS WELL AS- INTEREST RATES THAT THESE ARE ALL MARKET MARKET BECAUSE THE- THE ADVOCATES ARE SAYING THEY'RE WAY ABOVE MARKET. I CAN'T GET PERSONALLY I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT ALL I DID SAY ONE WAS NOT OR NOT YOUR YOUR RIBS IN THE INDUSTRY I UNDERSTAND THAT- WHAT I SAID WAS THAT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM HAS A CERTAIN WAY THAT THEY CALCULATE- PAYMENTS TO NURSING FACILITIES FOR PURPOSES OF RENTS AND LEASES AND IT'S- IT'S BASED ON A PARTICULAR FORMULA IT'S NOT BASED ON WHAT. THE FACILITY PAYS IN RENT OR LEASES- I WOULD- I WOULD SAY AND I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS CONVERSATION JUST RECENTLY WITH A CONSTANTLY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD STAFF ABOUT. A WEEK WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTION BECAUSE- IN MORE CASES THAN OFTEN- IT'S NOT THE NURSING FACILITY OPERATOR THAT OWNS THE- THE- ACTUAL BUILDING ITSELF IT'S- OTHER FORMS OF. REITS OR OTHER THINGS AND A LOT OF CASES ARE FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE AS WELL- IT'S OVER AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO WORK ON THAT- AND WE'RE OPEN TO IT TO TALKING MORE ABOUT. WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT RECENT COSTS IN THAT REGARD. GREAT THANK YOU I'M I'M JUST GOING TO GO BACK TO- MISTER CHIP. TO TELL THANK YOU THANK YOU DEAR DEAR RESPONSE BECAUSE- FROM THE STARTERS RESPONSE BECAUSE I DID THANK YOU MUCH OF AN ANSWER. SO THESE ARE YOUR BOARDS. YEAH I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM I HAVE A- A FEW RESPONSES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS SYSTEM IS REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM WAS DEVISED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WITHOUT ANY PARTICIPATION ANY MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION FROM RESIDENT ADVOCATES IT WAS SORT OF A LAST MINUTE DEAL. WITH THEM WE WERE EXCLUDED FROM AND WE SUBMIT THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR THERE HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO BUY GOOD CARE IN NURSING HOMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR PAYMENTS TO NURSING HOME FROM THE STATE HAVE GONE UP OVER ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THE AMOUNT PAID IN WAGES TO STAFF IS ABOUT 50% INCREASE THERE'S A BIG DISPARITY THERE- WE'VE BEEN RICH. OWNERS THE- MULTIPLE IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN ENRICHED- BUT THERE'S BEEN LONG LONG STANDING UNDER INVESTMENT. IN THE WORKFORCE SO OUR OUR PROPOSAL WE HAVE A LOT OF- RECOMMENDATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR EXPLORING A LOT OF THEM THAT THEY'RE ALL STILL VERY VIABLE BUT WHAT WE REALLY WOULD LIKE. IS FOR ANY FUTURE INCREASES CAN BE TIED DIRECTLY TO STAFF TO INCREASING THE STAFFING MINIMUM SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT RELATED. TO INCREASE STAFF- WE DO HAVE AGAIN WE'RE ALL FOR INCREASING WAGES JUST TO FRONTLINE WORKERS MEETING THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA- BUT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT. SUBSIDIZING CNA'S IS THAT THEY MIGHT END UP IF. THEY MIGHT END UP REPLACING LPNS ARE REGISTERED NURSES. ARE ONES THAT C. N. A.'S I WILL PAYING THEM MORE WE GET THEM IN THE BUILDING BUT THEN THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THE FACILITIES FROM THAN LAYING OFF OTHER DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE. INSTEAD BECAUSE NOW THAT IT'S CHEAPER TO HIRE THIS UNITS SO- LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD BE DONE BUT AGAIN. WE'RE TOTALLY FOR INCREASING WAGES INCREASING. WORKFORCE NURSING ABSOLUTE. WELL FRANKLY YOU I APPRECIATE THAT THE FEEDBACK ARE WHAT WE QUESTION HAD IS THE TO BACK TO WHAT MR IT IS. YOU MET MEDICARE'S A FORMULA IT'S ALL THESE THINGS ARE REIMBURSED IS IT. IS IT IS THIS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARRANGE FOR MEDIC CAL IS BEING TOO PERMISSIVE THAT THESE. YOU KNOW THE RENTS THE LEAST BACKS THE- INSURANCE THE INTEREST RATES THAT THIS REALLY. CAN US NOT DOING OUR JOB TO TIGHTEN MEDICARE. YEAH WE SUBMIT THAT THERE'S- TONS OF INFLATED RATES BEING PAID TO RELATED PARTY ENTITIES. THERE ARE ON THE BOOKS MEDI CAL AUDITS AND JUST ALLOWANCES FOR CERTAIN. COSTS ARE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THOUGH IS WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY OPERATORS INFLATING THEIR RATES THAT RISE THE AVERAGE RATE UP SO. YOU COST MIGHT NOT LOOK SO- OUTLOOK SO MUCH LIKE AN OUT LIAR OF EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT. ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE JUST ALLOWANCES IS THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT THE FACILITY REFUND THE MONEY. IT JUST GETS BAKED INTO THEIR FUTURE MEDICARE RIGHT MAYBE THE MEDICARE RATE GETS LOWERED IN THE FUTURE BUT THAT GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY. TO RAISE OTHER COSTS. IN RETURN SO IF YOUR COSTS ARE HIGH YOU CAN JUST KEEP RAISING UNKNOWNS OSCAN THE QUESTION. BECAUSE EVERYONE'S COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN NO ONE CAN THAT. THAT'S THAT JUST COMES WITH THE MARKETERS. PRECISELY SO OKAY. ARE KICKING WE GO MISS. AARON TURNER NO SHE'S. WELL INTO AND SEARCH IT JUST GOING BACK TO MEDICARE ALL- HOW IS THIS YEAR WHAT WHAT THE ADVOCATES ARE RAISING THOSE ISSUES THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE WOULD THAT SOUND IN OUR HANDS THAT WE HAVE TO GO OVER FOR MEDICAL. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I THINK REALLY STATE WE DO HAVE A IN ALL HONESTY IT BUT IT JUST OR LEMONADE ANY OF THE NON ELIGIBLE OR EXCESSIVE COST- INCLUDING THINGS LIKE PROFITS FROM RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW. IF THERE ARE INDICATORS OF FRAUD THAT ARE IDENTIFIED DURING THE COURSE OF ANY OF THE ANNUAL FACILITY AUDITS WE- WILL OPEN A FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND OUR INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALSO. OPEN BASED ON COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDING THE PUBLIC AND OTHER REGULATORY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND IF WE DO DETERMINE IF THERE'S A CREDIBLE ALLEGATION OF FRAUD. AND WE WILL WORK FOR THE CASE. TO WILL TALK ABOUT FRAUD I. THINK YOU YOU HEARD- MISTER TELL WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS THE INDUSTRY. AND IF THE AID THE ENTIRE IF EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY IS INFLATING THE COST BECAUSE THEY CAN GET. MONEY BACK FROM MEDICAL- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE REVIEWING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE'S- ARTICULATE. DOCTORS ARE LOOKING AT RELATED PARTY- COST AND LOOKING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE ME CAPTURED- WE-ARE ALSO LOOKING TO IDENTIFY ANY OVERPAYMENTS THAT ARE RECOVERED FROM THE FACILITY- THESE COULD BE DUPLICATE PAYMENTS- PAYMENTS AT WORK. WOULDN'T TALK TO BRUSSELS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AUDITORS ARE HOW HOW DID THE WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THE BASELINE IS SO HIGH THAT WE'VE ACCEPTED THIS REALLY HIGH BASELINE AND WE'RE GETTING KIND OF YOU KNOW WERE WERE FOR PAN- A LOT TO THE OPERATORS WHO OWN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY ON THE BUILDINGS. THEY ARE LENDERS. OR NOT PAINS SEEMS LIKE WE'RE NOT PAYING THE WORKERS THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED- SO I GUESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHEN THE AUDITORS A LOOK AT THAT HOW DID THEY DETERMINE WHAT THE BASELINE READ WHAT THE BASELINE- YOU KNOW INSURANCE PAYMENT SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT THE BASELINE INTEREST RATES SUPPOSED TO BE. I'M A 10% INTEREST IT SOUNDS PRETTY PRETTY HIGH. I AM J. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF HOW THEY DO THAT CALCULATION- HOWEVER I DO KNOW THAT THEY THEY WORK AT EXTENSIVELY AMONGST THEMSELVES STARTED TO WORK THROUGH AND ENSURE THAT WHEN THERE ARE RELATED PARTIES THAT THAT THEY ARE LOOKING- ARE BROADLY TO DETERMINE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE. WE GET AN ANSWER BY NEXT WEEK REGARDING THE SPECIFICS TO THESE QUESTIONS I WILL TAKE THAT BACK YES- THEN- JUST GO GO GO INTO THE WORK FORCE I THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW- I'M NOT A WORK FORCE EXPERT YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE ACTUALLY HAVE WORKFORCE EXPERTS HERE SO I'LL TRY TO BE FAST AND WHAT THE EXPERTS CRACKS OR QUESTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT IS VERY CLEAR IS ON WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS PEOPLE WHO CAN'T. LIVE ON THE JOBS. THAT THEY'RE WORKING. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE- THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN THE WORK FORCE TO PAY FORTY HOURS- WE SAW WE HEARD DOING COVERT QUITE OFTEN. THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS WERE SPREADING COVERT BECAUSE NOT NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT HAVING A GOOD TIME IS BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING FROM ONE NURSING HOME TO THE NEXT NURSING HOME TO THE NEXT NURSING HOME BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO OR THREE JOBS. SO I GUESS- YOU'RE GOING BACK TO AGAIN WHAT IS THE INDUSTRY DOING MISTER CAN YOU TALK ABOUT. HOW YOU'RE WORKING TO TRY TO. NOT HAVE NOT BE TOTALLY RELIED ON A PART TIME WORK FORCE PER FULL TIME WORK FORCE AND ARE. YOU KNOW BETTER BETTER PAID WORK FORCE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK. THREE JOBS THREE FACILITIES. I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MANY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GOALS FIRE- NURSING FACILITY WAS- YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY USE THOSE PANDEMIC FUNDS. TO RAISE SALARIES WAGES- BECAUSE EVEN IF IN SOME CASES C. N. A.'S WERE FULL TIME WORKERS THEY WOULD NEED TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS TO BE ABLE TO. TO MAKE THINGS YOU KNOW I WORK SO- APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THIS THAT SITUATION AND WAGES- FOR OUR NURSING HOME WORKERS I THINK- THAT IS WHY. A CALF HAS PROPOSED. THE PROPOSAL THAT THEY HAVE WHICH THEY SAID WHICH IS THE DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE AND MAKING THAT COMMITMENT- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MEDICAL PROGRAM AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO THAT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR THEIR C. N. A.'S AND MOVE THE INDUSTRY FORWARD. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE OKAY I GET THAT BUT IT'S CLEAR YOU KNOW YOU WANT MORE MONEY FROM US YOU WANT MORE MONEY FOR US FOR TRAINING YOUR MORE MONEY FOR US FOR MEDIC CAL. WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR IS WITH THE INDUSTRY PUTTING ON THE TABLE I DIDN'T HEAR ANY INDUSTRY MONEY COME THE TABLE. EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THIRD THAT MIGHT COME A FIVE MINUTE CAL COMES BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT LIKE YOU KNOW. AND AGAIN I DON'T I DON'T I'M NOT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS IS TRUE WITH MR JUNCKER TELLS CENTER. I HAVE NOTHING TO BELIEVE THAT IS NOT TRUE. BUT IS THERE ANY BELT TIGHTENING IS THERE ANY EFFICIENCY WHAT WHAT'S THE INDUSTRY BRING TO THE TABLE EXCEPT FOR. A LITTLE MORE MONEY ON TOP OF A MEDICARE RATING CHRIS. I WOULD SAY THAT. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WHAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHERE THERE IS POSSIBLY. ABUSES THAT TONY TO TELL HAS MENTIONED THAT THE ADVOCATES OF MENTION. THAT THERE WERE WILLING AS AN INDUSTRY TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THAT AND TO ALLOW FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT THAT. AND DETERMINE IF THOSE COSTS ARE REASONABLE OR NOT- YOU'RE ASKING US FOR MORE MONEY ON TRADE RIGHT SO HOW MUCH IS THE ASSOCIATE HOW MUCH IS YOUR COLLECTION OF. OPERATORS GOING UPON TABLE FOR TRAINING. YOU KNOW HOW HOW HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE. TAKING A LOOK AT TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS I MEAN ALL I ALL I SAW ON YOUR FOUR POINTS WAS GOVERNMENT THIS GOVERNMENT THAT DISPUTE. YOU'RE MOSTLY A FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY. SEOUL I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND I MEAN IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE COMPLETELY RELIANT ON GOVERNMENT TO RUN YOUR INDUSTRY WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S TRUE THOUGH BUT THAT'S BASED ON THE FOUR POINTS YOU BROUGHT FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEE I DIDN'T SEE HEY THIS IS WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING DOT THE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MISSING AT LEAST INTRODUCED IN THIS ANALYSIS OF MAYBE IT'S AN OVERSIGHT FROM OUR CONSULTANT WHO. MAY NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT I WOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. FOR THEM. WHAT MY PURPOSE WAS FOR TODAY WAS TO. RELATE WHAT WE HAD HOPED WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM. AND WITH MEDIC CAL AS A PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR FACILITIES. I APOLOGIZE IF I AM NOT PREPARED TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS DOING. I KNOW THAT THEY ARE- I KNOW THAT THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING AND THEY'RE DOING A LOT SO. MAYBE WHAT I CAN DO TODAY IS COMMIT TO YOU. THAT WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HI AT THE SOONEST ALL TO MAKE. SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT. EXACTLY WHERE THEIR COMMITMENT LIES YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA. YOU KNOW SOMEHOW I DON'T GET PAID IF I DON'T GET THE BUDGET DONE BY JUNE FIFTEENTH THAT'S A DATE. SO WHAT I'D SAY IS HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEK. SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU JORDAN DR WHAT IS GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE A COUPLE OF THINGS- THAT'S THE QUESTION SO- V. AUDITS THE YARD IS RELATED TO- RELATED PARTIES WENT NGUYEN HAVE HOW HOW MANY HAVE HOW MANY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND IF WE HAVE A COMPLETED. WHICH IS WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENED WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THOSE AUDITS TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE THE QUESTION BAGS THAT AND THIS IS WHERE MR TANG WAS GOING. IT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE HOW DO WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT'S REASONABLE GOING FORWARD SO WIN HOW MAY I HAVE THE ODDS HOW MANY AUDITS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE AND IF NOT WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT BECAUSE- I THINK THIS WAS SET. PRETTY SURE BECAUSE IT WAS PROBABLY MY WORK THAT WE SET THIS IN MOTION QUITE AWHILE AGO SO. HELP US UNDERSTAND WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS. SO THANK YOU AS A MEMBER AND I JUST WANT TO CLEAR FOR YOU ASKING ABOUT THE AUDITS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR COPING RELATED EXPENDITURES OR THE RELATED EXPENDITURES NO NO PER PRIOR TO THAT THE. THE THIRD THE- RELATED PARTIES. I WILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THEM AND ASK OUR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS YOU EXACTLY HOW MANY HAVE BEEN- COMPLETED I KNOW THAT THAT DOES AUDIT THAT IS PART OF THE AUDIENCE THAT THEY ARE DOING NOW- DAY INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE RELATED PARTY- COMPONENTS AND EXPENSES BUT I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF HOW MANY HAVE HAD TO PRODUCTION TO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- AVAILABLE BUT I TAKE THAT BACK AND HAVE THAT BE PART OF OUR RESPONSE. AT THIS POINT I INTERESTED IN REDUCTIONS I'M JUST INTERESTED IN WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS MAYBE MISS WINDOWS BUT WHEN THIS ANSWER I DO NOT KNOW YOU DO NOT OKAY. I'M INTERESTED. I WONDER WHAT AND THEN. THE INCLUSION OF THAT REVIEW OF THE RELATED PARTY IS HAPPENING TODAY. AND THAT IS THAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS PART OF THE AUDITS THAT ARE COMPLETED HAVE TWO YEARS IN ARREARS. OKAY OKAY APPRECIATE THAT SO- AND I'M JUST GOING TO FOLLOW UP I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT IS A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING AND SO. I APPRECIATE THE DRIVE TO TWENTY FIVE AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON. WHETHER THE STATE CAN PROVIDE FOR PROVIDE MORE MONEY BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS- NUMBER ONE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- IN THIS COUNTRY MET PACKED SO ISN'T MY THIS ISN'T MY INFORMATION- THAT CONSOLIDATION IN HEALTH CARE- IS A GROWING ISSUE. CONSOLIDATION AND THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE WISE CONSOLIDATION AS FAR AS- IS IN NURSING HOMES. AND I BELIEVE WAS ELEVEN POINT 4% IS WHAT I'M RECALLING AND IF I'M WRONG I'M WRONG BUT BUT I. CONSOLIDATION AND PRIVATE EQUITY PROFIT SO I'M TROUBLED THAT- WE'VE HEARD YOU HAVE BILLIONAIRE- OPERATORS- YOU HAVE- CONSOLIDATION- WE HAVE ALL THESE RELATED PARTIES HERE- WITH INCLUDE THINGS LIKE UNNECESSARY INSURANCE AND HIGH INTEREST RATES AND- AND. AND WE'VE HAD WE HAD WE HAD YOU KNOW CHALLENGES OBVIOUSLY DURING CODED AS WELL SO. I A- I. I'M JUST I'M STRUGGLING IT BECAUSE LIKE LIKE MR TANG SAID YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY IS LARGELY FOR PROFIT- SO WHY ISN'T THAT TRICKLING DOWN MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING HERE IS HAPPENING TO THE LEVEL THAT IS BEING PRESENTED TO US I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S WHY THESE AUDITS ARE SO IMPORTANT. AND SO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT YOU KNOW- IN OWNING AND LEASING BUILDINGS IT'S IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT I KNOW IN MY OWN DISTRICT THERE'S OPERATORS IT'S REALLY REALLYDIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON QUITE FRANKLY. AND YOU KNOW YOU OPERATORS. BRING IN DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO SET UP A DIFFERENT ENTITY AND- AND- EVEN ENTITY FOR LAUNDRY- INTERVIEW ALL ENTITY FOR ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. THEY'RE ALL REALLY TIED BACK TO. A CORE GROUP OF PEOPLE- AND IT FEELS LIKE THE ONLY. PURPOSE IS TO GET MORE PROFIT. SO IF THEY'RE PROFITABLE ALREADY. AND MAKING YOU KNOW MAKING THESE PROFITS WHICH- YOU KNOW AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE. WHY WHY CAN'T I AND I'M ALL FOR PROFIT DON'T GIVE. ME I HAD MY OWN BUSINESS I NEEDED TO BE PROFITABLE TO SURVIVE THAT'S- THAT. BUT AT WHAT POINT. ARE WE SACRIFICING THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR PEOPLE- HAS CERTAINLY WHAT POINT WE SACRIFICING THE SALARIES OF THE PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE. I JUST. AND THAT'S WHY THIS THAT'S WHY THE THAT'S WHY THAT'S WHY GO BACK THESE AUDITS WENT YOU KNOW WHEN WE GOING TO GET THEM SO WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS. AND YOU KNOW. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY- AND I HOPE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY WHAT IT OFTEN LEADS TO WAS. IF THERE'S THINGS GOING ON YOU CAN BET THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE- BUT I WANTED TO BE. I HOPE WE'RE GETTING TRANSPARENCY THAT. YEAH HE CAN YOU CAN SEE THROUGH ALL THE WAY ALL THE WAY DOWN DOWN THE STREET BECAUSE- I THINK THERE'S A IT JUST FEELS LIKE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND. AND- LIKE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THIS ENTIRE PANEL FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON IN HERE OUR FINAL PANEL PANEL NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS ON THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROPOSALS AND ISSUES. WE WILL HAVE TO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL BEGINNING WITH RENEE MAILLOT. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY AT DH CS. AND MONICA MON TANO. REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. LET US BEGIN WITH RENAME ALL OF. THANK YOU SO MUCH SHARE I'M SO FIRST I'M GOING TO COVER OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AT THE HELP OKAY AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT THE DEMO. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WERE PROPOSING TO THE EXISTING LAW ALAINA SCHEMERS AND DENTAL CARE WITH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. AND NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED GUIDELINES FOR THE MEDICARE POPULATION BY ADDING HAS A COVERED BENEFIT LABORATORY PROCESS CROWNS FOR INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. THE BUDGET INCLUDES A THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IN TOTAL FUNDS THIRTEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS PROPOSAL. UNDER CURRENT LAW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE LABORATORY PROCESS CROWNS ON POSTERIOR TEETH. ARE NOT A COVERED BENEFIT EXCEPT FOR WHEN THERE'S A POSTERIOR TOON THAT IS NECESSARY AS AN APARTMENT TO ANY FIXED OR REMOVABLE FEAST. THE EXISTING REIMBURSEMENT RATE COMPORTS WITH OTHER SIMILAR SERVICES COMPLEXION WE NEED BASED ON LAFAYETTE. AND AS AN AS AN EXAMPLE IN IS ALSO ELIGIBLE THAT LABORATORY THE CROWNS THAT WE COVER IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IT IS ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR A 40% A SCHEDULE OUT MAXIMUM ALLOWANCES SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER OUR. FIFTY SIX A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TODAY. THE NEXT PROPOSAL I'M GOING TO COVER IS ON OUR DENTAL MANAGED CARE EXTENSION BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO WE DO HAVE PROPOSED CUTS IN THE OPERATION THE OPERATING- THE EXISTING DENTAL MANAGED CONTRACT. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR I'M IN BEING HIDDEN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS EXTENSION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR US TO PROCURE AND EXECUTE NEW CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE THE DOMINANCE CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN SACRAMENTO AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE END OF THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE RIGHT. AND AGAIN THIS IS THE WAY OF OUR THAT WAS JUST APPROVED BY CMS. AB THAT WAS A RENEWAL OF OUR FIRE. NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WAY. SO CONTRA WORTH FROM THE FOR WOULD BE A- NO SOONER CHEN ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND DO YOU SEE THAT IS COMMITTED TO INCREASING MEDICAL BENEFITS YOUR UTILIZATION OF DENTAL SERVICES STATEWIDE. EXTENSION TIMELINE FOR THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL FORCE BOND WITH THE TIME FRAME THAT IS WHEN YOU GET FOUR DEFEATS THE ASCOT BERKSHIRE NEW CONTRACTS. VIA A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. WE INTO TO MAINTAIN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL OF OUR DMC CONTRACTORS OR DENTAL MANAGED CARE CONTRACTORS. THE EXTENDED CONTRACT TAKE INCREASE MEMBER UTILIZATION OF DENTAL SERVICE. ADDITIONALLY OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES HAVE SHARED AN INTEREST IN SEEING DENTAL UTILIZATION RATES IMPROVING AND OUR DENTAL MANAGED CARE COUNTY AGAIN THAT IS IN SACRAMENTO AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THROUGH THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER OF ALL WHICH REQUIRED BEACH YES TO DO THE FALL. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MONITOR PLAN PERFORMANCE ON KEY QUALITY MEASURES. WERE ALSO TO CONSIDER PRIOR PERFORMANCE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS OPERATING IN THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AS A COMPONENT IN THE REAPER CARE. AS A POTENTIAL- AWARDEES FIVE YEAR HISTORIC PERFORMANCE ON THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE MEASURE IS BELOW THE HISTORIC PERFORMANCE OF THE STATE THE FOR SERVICE IN THE PROGRAM. THEN THE STATE MUST PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION TO SEE A MASS FOR BOARDING THE CONTRACT TO THAT GIVEN MANAGED CARE. THE STATE. ACCIDENT OF THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM AND THEN SUBMIT THESE FINDINGS NINETY DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR. WE MUST ALSO ESTABLISH PAYMENT WITHHOLD ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE LINKED TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TARGETS. BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WE MUST ALSO SUBMIT ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED MANAGED CARE PLAN DEFICIENCIES TO SEE AMOUNTS. AND THE STATE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO. LOOK AT PARITY OF PERFORMANCE BETWEEN THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. IF IT DOES NOT ACHIEVED IN EACH OF THE MEASURE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THAN BENEFICIARIES IN COUNTIES WHERE WE HAVE MANDATORY ENROLLMENT INTO DENTAL MANAGED CARE WHICH WOULD BE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'M THOSE BENEFICIARIES MUST BE ALLOWED TO DECIMAL FROM ANY MONEY AND THAT IS NOT ASSURING- ADEQUATE QUALITY OF SERVICES AND THEN THE STATE MUST UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF THAT MANAGED CARE PLAN WITHIN FOUR MONTHS. AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHETHER THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACT SHOULD BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED SO AGAIN- THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT I JUST WALK THROUGH ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE AND NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR DENTAL. MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. AT THIS TIME I WILL ALSO PROVIDE. WANTS TO ASK SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION AND AGAIN THESE WERE- AT QUESTIONS THAT WE WERE ASKED TO RESPOND TO THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE AGE. SO AGAIN I HAVE A QUESTION OR THAT THE COMMENTS BY I CBA. THEY EXPLAINED THAT UNDER TELLING THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH I JUST WALK THROUGH. I WORK HARD DENTAL MANAGED CARE TO PERFORMANCE CHARITY WITH FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEREFORE CDA RIGHT THAT MEANS THAT THE EIGHT CST MARC WATTS O MONITORING AND TRACKING. OF DENTAL. MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND A AND- WE DO MONITOR BALLPARK FEE FOR SERVICE AND R. DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ACROSS THE PUBLISHED PERFORMANCE MEASURES. AND ALSO IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT I JUST WALK THROUGH. A SPECIFIC TO THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE WILL HAVE TO DO THE MONITORING I THAT I HAD IDENTIFIED AND AGAIN I'LL JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF POINTS. OUT WE WILL BE ESTABLISHING PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE UTILIZATION OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS ANNUAL DENTAL VISITS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND SEALANTS FOR CHILDREN ACROSS TWO AGE GROUPS. AGES SIX TO NINE IN AGES TEN TO FOURTEEN. PLANS MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TO WORKS THE- WHILE ALSO AS I INDICATED DEVELOP HE- WITH WHOLE METHODOLOGY FOR DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT DO NOT MEET THAT- IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE TARGETS. WE WILL ALSO UTILIZE THEIR HISTORIC OUTPERFORMANCE OF THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AGAINST THAT FEE FOR SERVICE. AS A FACTOR IN AWARDING FUTURE CONTRACTS WALL REAPER CARING NEW DENTAL MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. AND THEN AGAIN TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLAN DOES NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE REALIZATION OF THE FOR SERVICE. THEN WE CAN GET SOME MORE MEMBERS FROM THAT. AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT A MEMBER DOES CHOOSE TO DECIMAL FROM THE DOWN MANAGED CARE AND THEN AGAIN WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO A REVIEW OF THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLAN WITHIN FOUR MONTHS. TO THEN DETERMINE IF THAT PLANE SHOULD BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED. THE NEXT. SET OF COMMENTS FROM CDA. I DEALS WITH DH CS- IDENTIFYING A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED UNDER. THAT DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE AGAIN WHICH WAS ONE OF THE INITIATIVES UNDER OUR FIRE MEDIC HELPED ONE TWENTY WAIVER AND NOW CONCLUDED. AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. AND THEIR COMMENTS ARE THAT THIS WOULD RESULT I IN TERMS OF SOME PROVIDERS NOT BEING REIMBURSED. FOR GETTING UNDER REIMBURSED FOR SOME SERVICES AND SEE THE A STATE THAT THIS WAS THE STATE'S ERROR. AND THAT THERE ARE PROVIDERS THAT. SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED IN THIS WAY. SO M. UNDER THE ADDED TRANSFER INITIATIVE. WELL CLOTHING DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT INITIATIVE IN THOSE EFFORTS WERE LARGELY UNSUCCESSFUL AND THEY ON THE GENERAL- TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE WAS CARRIED THROUGH INTO A SIX YEAR FOR AN EXTENSION THERE IT WHILE WE WERE WORKING ON THE RENEWAL OF THE CURRENTLY APPROVED NINETEEN FIFTEEN. RIGHT AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUATION THERE WAS A REAL POTENTIAL TO EXCEED THE FUNDING AUTHORITY ON WHICH WAS A BOX- APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AS SOON AS TCS BECAME AWARE OF THE ANTICIPATED SHORTFALL I BASED UPON REAL IME AND PROJECTED CLAIMS DATA WE WERE VERY PROACTIVE IN TRANSPARENT WITH BOTH PROVIDERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND NOW PERSON WENT TO THE NOW EXPIRED MEDICAL TWENTY TWENTY WAIVER TO THE EXTENT WARRANTED DH YEAH. DOES HAVE AN ABILITY TO ISSUE PROGRAM IF HE MEANT IF GIVEN DTI DOMAIN OR DOMAINS WORK RISK OVER EXPENDITURES AND AGAIN THIS PROGRAM ABOUT OUR REQUIREMENT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIRE MATAGAL TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE UNDER WORDS THAT DTI OPERATE. AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT OUR TEAM TO NOT PROVIDERS FOR ACTUAL SERVICES RENDERED BUT WHAT IS IN QUESTION IS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE WILL HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE ON A PROGRAM BASED. PROVIDERS ARE BEING REIMBURSED FOR THEIR COVERED SERVICES HOWEVER DUE TO THE SHORTFALL THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PROVIDERS MAY NOT RECEIVE THEIR DTI INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. FOR CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE PERFORMANCE. AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO KEEP PROVIDERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OF THE THAT. ARE VIABLE ATTENDS AS WELL AS THE VERY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WE HOLD REGARDING CARDINAL PARK. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS ON THE ISSUE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MONICA MON TUNNEL WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MONTHS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TO THEM. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION'S TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBER DENTISTS FIRST I WANT TO START OFF WITH STATING THAT CDA APPLAUDS THE DEPARTMENT'S AMBITIOUS GOALS AND EFFORTS IN CALLAHAM. THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN INCREASING ACCESS AMONG BENEFICIARIES AS WELL AS A STEADY INCREASE OF MEDICAID DENTAL PROVIDERS. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO SEE THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM IMPROVE. CDA IS SUPPORTIVE OF DECSS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE LAB PROCESS CRIME BENEFIT. AS THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING GAP A MEDIC CAL DENTAL COVERAGE. THE DENTAL CROWN IS A COMMON RESTORATIVE PROCEDURE THAT ALLOWS THE DENTIST TO SAVE THE TOOTH WAS SIGNIFICANT DECAY OFTEN AVOIDING A COSTLY REPAIR NOW OR THE LOSS OF A TOOTH. CDA BELIEVES MEDICARE MEMBER SHOULD HAVE A DENTAL BENEFIT THAT MEETS THE STANDARD OF CARE. HOWEVER WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS PROPOSED BENEFIT WILL NOT TRANSLATE INTO ACCESS AS A PROPOSED RATE DOES NOT EVEN COVER THE COST OF PROVIDING THE SERVICES. THE PROPOSED RATE IS WELL BELOW THE ACTUAL COST TO PROVIDE A CROWN. THE COST IS HIGH BECAUSE A CUSTOM CROWN MUST BE CREATED TO ACQUIRING THE DENTIST EITHER PAY AN OUTSIDE LAB FEE OR INVEST OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT TO PROCESS THEM IN OFFICE. IN ADDITION A CROWN PLACEMENT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CHAIR TIME BUT THE LEAST TWO VISITS. AT THE EXISTING PROPOSED REIMBURSEMENT RATES DENTISTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE EXPANDED NUMBER OF CROWNBET OF COVER CROWNS WITHOUT SUFFERING SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES. AND AS YOU KNOW A BENEFIT WITHOUT A FUNCTIONAL GREAT IS NOT A REAL BENEFIT AND IT WILL LEAD TO INSUFFICIENT ACCESS FOR BENEFICIARIES. CDA IS SEEKING AN INCREASE IN THE SCHEDULED MAXIMUM ALLOWANCE TO SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS WHICH ROUGHLY EQUATES TO AN ADDITIONAL. THIRTY MILLION TO DH CS IS PROPOSAL. THIS IS A- TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT COVERAGE EXPANSION MEANINGFUL FUNCTIONAL AND MOST OF ALL A REAL BENEFIT. REGARDING DENTAL MANAGED CARE IDES IS ALREADY GONE OVER BROADLY THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS- BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS OVERALL A LEAD ON THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS SEEK TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION AND ACCESS GAP BETWEEN DENTAL MANAGED CARE AND THE FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS LONG CONCERNED CDM. UTILIZATION RATES OF DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND FEE FOR SERVICE. ESPECIALLY FOR PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE THERE'S BEEN A 627% LOWER UTILIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH RECEIVING AN ANNUAL DENTAL VISIT AND DENTAL MANAGED CARE. COMPARED TO FEE FOR SERVICE. AND THIS UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I BRING UP THE LOWER RATES OF DENTAL MANAGED CARE BECAUSE PER THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AT DH CS AS MENTIONED. IF THERE IS NOT PERFORMANCE PARITY BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED. BASED ON THIS DATA GIVEN THE VARIOUS TIMELINES FOR THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THIS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WEREN'T EVER BUST TRANSITION PLAN INCLUDING BENEFICIARY NOTIFICATIONS PROVIDER OUTREACH AND CONTINUITY OF CARE. WE URGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MONITOR UTILIZATION AND INSURE THAT WHEN AND IF EXISTING PLANS ARE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED. THAT THERE BE A ROBUST TRANSITION PLACE. TRANSITION PLAN IN PLACE. LASTLY AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA CDA IS CONCERNED WITH THE A FUNDING SHORTFALL AFFECTING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DJI'S CHILDREN PREVENTATIVE SERVICES. THE TDI TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE ALSO KNOWN. I ALSO KNOWN AS THE TI PROVIDED A CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S PREVENTION SERVICES AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE MEDICAL DENTAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES. THE SUCCESSFUL PARTS OF DTI HAVE TRANSITIONED TO CALLAHAM AND DTI WAS EXTENDED- ANOTHER YEAR AS DEEDS DH CS HAS MENTIONED. BUT AGAIN THE FUNDING SHORTFALL OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS MEANS A DENTIST WHO HAVE PROVIDED SERVICES UNDER DTI TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL NOT RECEIVE THE FULL PAYMENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YES WHILE THIS IS DTI INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THERE ARE. THIS IS ACTUALLY CREATED A NEW INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT NEVER EXISTED BEFORE ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT RANGE FROM A THIRD ARE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF PROVIDERS ARE RELYING ON. THIS A ROADS THE TRUST BETWEEN PROVIDERS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND WE BELIEVE THE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE BACK FILLED. WE URGE THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN FUNDING AS PROVIDERS DELIVER THESE SERVICES AND GOOD FAITH TO THEIR PATIENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WITH. YES THANK YOU- TO. A SMALL- AND- AND- MISS MANTEGNA- FOR THEIR PRESENTATION I'M CURIOUS- WELL COUPLE THINGS I'M GONNA AGREE- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH CDA. THAT THE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLAR RATE IS- FOR A CROWN IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE BASED ON MY OF NEARLY THIRTY YEARS PRACTICING DENTISTRY- I DON'T SEE HOW THAT REALLY WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD- I HAVEN'T PRACTICED IN A WHILE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS PRACTICING MY CROWN. RATES FROM MY PRIVATE LAB WHICH I HAD- WERE IN OFTENTIMES A DEPENDING ON THE PRICE OF METALS WHICH IS ALSO AN ISSUE- TWO HUNDRED. PLUS UP INTO MAYBE INTO A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR SOMETIMES- TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICE TO MY- TO MY PATIENTS SO- THAT DIDN'T COUNT THE CHAIR TIME. AND AND THEN MY RATE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT- YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE WE'RE PROBABLY IN THE THIRTY. DON'T KNOW HOW I KNOW HOW THE DENTIST MAKES IT. QUITE FRANKLY BASED ON THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLAR HOW ABOUT HOW TO MAKE IT ON THAT EITHER BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER IS BUT THAT WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS IT. IS IT DOESN'T DOESN'T WORK SO- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT- I KNOW IN OUR BUDGET ACTIVE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE CALLED FOR- THE PROCUREMENT OF- REAL. REGARDING THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE ABOUT- CONTRACTS. AND THAT NEVER CALLING FOR BY BY DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND NOW WE'RE CALLING FOR AN EXTENSION OF ANOTHER YEAR- CAN. WITH WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THE EXTENSION AND- BECAUSE WE CALL FORD IN THE BUDGET EVERY ALL THREE PARTIES AGREED THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE GOVERNOR. WHY WHY. WHY ARE WE NOT WHITE WHY WE'VE EXTENDED A YEAR. SO BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR DISCUSSIONS REGARDING DENTAL MANAGED CARE AND BECAUSE DOWN ON MANAGED CARE IS A COMPONENT PART OF THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS I'M IN THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH A VERY PROCUREMENT BECAUSE THE EXISTING CONTRACTS TO DATE. HAVE EXPIRED SO THEY HAVE BEEN EXTENDED WE HAVE AN ABILITY TO EXTEND THEM THE EXTENSION IS ONLY IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN THEN CONDUCT THE NEED OF PROCUREMENT TO THEN GO OUT TO IDENTIFY. HOPEFULLY I'M DIFFERENT MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT WOULD COME TO THE TABLE TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT TIME. IN ORDER TO DO THE REPORTS ARE MEANT FOR THOSE NEW CONTRACTS AND WE CANNOT DO THAT WITHOUT CONTRACTS JUST BE AN EXTENDED THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE PROCURED. THE LAST REPORT CARE MEANT I WANT TO SAY IT WAS AROUND- NINE OH TEN I BELIEVE I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT THE ARMY BUT IT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE IS THAT A NORMAL INTERVAL. TWELVE YEARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME. WELL THERE ARE THERE ARE CONTRACT EXTENSION YEARS ON THE CONTRACT EXTENSION IS DIFFERENT THAN A PROCUREMENT HEALTH UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WHAT IS THE TIP WHAT WHAT IN IN THE REAL IN THE WORLD OF THIS WHAT IS OF- WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT SHOULD WHAT SHOULD ENTITIES OUT THERE WHO MIGHT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS RECENTLY EXPECT. FOR IT'S A TIME FRAME FOR REPORT RE PROCUREMENT TAKES TO DO WAY PROCUREMENTS ME TECHNICALLY WILL HAVE AT A BASE NEAR OUT FIVE YEARS AND THEN IDENTIFY EXTENSION YEARS OUR ONE YEAR EXTENSION YEARS TO WHERE IT MIGHT THEN GO FOR- EIGHT YEARS. BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE TINY AND THEN THE OTHER INTERVENING FACTORS BY TYPICALLY CONTRACTS WOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SAY FIVE MAYBE SEVEN YEARS AND THEN WITH EXTENSION YEARS THEREAFTER AB TWO I TYPICALLY WE SEE LIKE- FIVE IT'S NOT FIVE I'M SORRY LIKE THREE ONE YEAR EXTENSION TIME. AFTER THAT NUMBER BUILT ON. OUR FORMAT BECAUSE- SO THE LAST REPORT HERE IT WAS INTO THE AND NINE AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT. POTENTIALLY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S FOURTEEN YEARS IF MY MATH IS CORRECT- THAT. I'M SORRY THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. NO UNDERSTOOD UNDERSTOOD. BUT I THINK THEY GET A NUMBER BUT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS WE JUST CONTINUE TO EXTEND THE CONTRACTS EXISTING CONTRACTS. WELL I GUESS I GUESS THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS. WE HAD A BUDGET ACT THAT EVERYBODY AGREED ON. ALL THREE PARTIES. AND HERE WE ARE THE NEXT WE'RE GONNA PUSH IT OUT ANOTHER YEAR. ARE WE GONNA PUSH IT IF WE IF WE COME TO AGREEMENT THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO PUSH IT OUT AGAIN. THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT WE ARE ACTIVELY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THEM REPORTS SHERMAN- PACKAGE. TO GO OUT AND SO WE DO HAVE- TIMELINE FOR THAT. AND AGAIN WITH OUR BOLD TO GET NEW CONTRACTS IN PLACE NO SOONER THAN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND AGAIN. IN THE INTERVENING TIME PERIODS. WE STILL HAVE THE SPECIALTERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT HERE. SO AGAIN IF WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE A LACK OF PERFORMANCE THEN WE WILL EXECUTE ON THOSE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AND TERMS ARE. CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FROM THE PLANT AND THEN ALSO DOING AN EVALUATION IN TERMS OF ARE MOVING FORWARD TO THEN. TO THEN RELEASE THOSE CONTRACTS FROM THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE OR PERFORM SO WAS THAT YOUR INTENT LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID THE BUDGET TO. I MEAN. DID WAS THE INTEL. WE DID I MEAN. IS IT LIKE IT WAS THE INTENT TO HAVE THESE CONTRACTS DONE BY THIS YEAR WHEN WE ALL AGREED AND SIGNED ON TO THE SIDE THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. I THINK AS WE WERE WORKING ON THE WORK THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH THE WAIVER AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AND GIVEN WHERE WE WORK ACT WHERE HAVING THE BUDGET AND THAT THAT WAIVER AND THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS. THE AN EXTENDED THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHAT THE FINAL OUTCOMES WERE I'VE BEEN NEGOTIATIONS. FOR THAT. SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING FOR NOW. ARE WHAT THOSE FINAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS WORK THAT WAY TO WORK READ ON AND FIND. YOU KNOW BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE'RE WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. SO I RECOGNIZE THE FRUSTRATION- AND AGAIN WE'RE WORKING AS FAST AS WE CAN IN TERMS OF THE PROCUREMENT. I TYPICAL PROCUREMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT THE EXECUTION THE SCORING AND ALL. AND TAKE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND WE ARE LOOKING TO WRAP THAT UP AND WE JUST NEED THAT TIME. TO GET BOTH THAT PROCUREMENT RELEASED ON THE STREETS. TO YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE RESPOND TO THE REQUEST DO THE EVALUATIONS AND THEN WORK TO GET NEW PLANS IN PLACE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DO THAT USING THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. AND I GUESS MY BIGGER POINT THERE IS THAT WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT. THE DELIVERY OF CARE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. YEAH WE'RE TWICE THE TO BUY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL TWICE. THE YEP TWO TIMES WHAT WOULD A NORMAL BY A NORMAL. PROCESS SO WE'RE JUST ENABLING THINGS TO NOT. BE EFFICIENT TO NOT ROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY CARE- ALONG THE WAY AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION. IS THAT WHY WE TWICE AS LONG I MEAN EARLY. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK ALSO WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN THAT SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AND THENGIVES US SOME ADDED LEVERAGE SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF OUR OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE PLANTS OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. I'M HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN TO DATE REGARDING AND THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND A LACK OF. OUT APPROPRIATE UTILIZATION OF OUR POPULATIONS SO IN THE INTERVENING TIME KERRY WE HAVE THESE- I REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO IMPOSE UPON THESE PLANS AND TO BE CLEAR WE NEED TO JUST LIKE OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS HAVE THOSE SAME CONCERNS WE HAVE BEEN ON THE RECORD WITH THIS. IN TERMS OF THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM- PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW OUR PROPOSALS WERE NOT ADOPTED I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AND WHAT THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS DO ALLOW US TO DO. IS. TO BE- MORE FORTHRIGHT AND IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR TO EVERYONE THEN BY THOSE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS BACK ACTIVE STEPS THAT WE WILL THEN TAKE. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE OUR PERFORMANCE BY THESE MANAGED CARE. SO SO IS CAN WHAT KINDS OF ASSURANCES CAN YOU GIVE US THAT THAT ACTUALLY THAT ACTUAL PRE PROCUREMENT WILL HAPPEN BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OR ARE WE GOING TO BE HERE NEXT YEAR TALKING ABOUT AN EXTENSION TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HERE. I'M AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THE PROCUREMENT. WE HAVE THE SAME GOALS AS YOU DO. TO EITHER MOVE FORWARD WITH NEW CLIENTS IN OUR PROGRAM OR TO THE EXTENT WE DO NOT HAVE FINAL PLANS. THEN THE EXISTING PLANS WOULD BE TERMINATED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF BECAUSE OF THEIR CONTINUED OR PERFORM. SO AGAIN WE HAVE LEVERS THAT IN THE INTERIM KIND. IF THEY ARE NOT MEETING THE METRICS THAT WE HAVE SET OUT AND WITH OUR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OUR ABILITY TO DO THIS ENROLLMENT BASED UPON THAT OR QUALITY OF THOSE PLANS DURING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS HAVING TO SUBMIT IF THERE WAS. YOU KNOW WHAT POTENTIAL FOR ANY OF THE EXISTING PLANS TO PARTICIPATE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE A PROGRAM PERFORMANCE METRICS MET OVER THE PAST FIVE FIVE YEARS. THEY HAVE NT BEEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AS IT COMPARES TO OUR FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO WE DO HAVE THE LEVERS THAT WE'VE WE NEED IN ORDER TO HELP INSURE THAT EITHER THROUGH THE WE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. OR THROUGH OUR MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT WE WILL THEN HAVE PLANS EITHER IN PLACE THAT CAN MEET OUR NEEDS ARE THOSE PLANS WILL NO LONGER BE IN PLACE BECAUSE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE FOR. YOU KNOW TO LEVERAGE THROUGH OUR SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THAT I RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE THE TOOLS THAT I AND I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT BUT IT DOESN'T BELIE THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER ENTITIES OUT THERE AVAILABLE QUALIFIED. THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE THOSE LEVERS IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT. PROIDERS IN PLACE DO YOU SEE MY POINT. I DO. AND OUR GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO GET TO THE TABLE THOSE PLANS THAT WE BELIEVE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS. AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CANNOT. BUT BUT SADLY WE FIXED WORKS YOU'RE ASKING US TO EXTEND ONCE AGAIN SO- ANYWAY I WE'RE WE'RE IN A CIRCULAR DISCUSSION AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET I DON'T WANNA BE HERE NEXT YEAR AND HAVE THE SAME DISCUSSION. PUSHED OUT. I I'VE I DON'T. THINK THAT'S AN UNREASONABLE REQUEST ON OUR PART. RIGHT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT I'M LOOKING FOR SOME CERTAINTY AND I JUST HEARING IT'S NOT OUR INTENT SO WE'D LIKE. I'D LIKE SOMETHING STRONGER QUITE FRANKLY. WE'RE NOW NOT FOR TODAY YEAH YEAH BUT I THINK I THINK WE DESERVE SOMETHING STRONGER THAN THAT. BUT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO FULLY COMMIT TO RELEASING THE RPG'S FLOORING IT BEING GET THE FULL INTENT TO HAVE NEW MANAGED- DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN PLACE BY THE JANUARY TIME PERIOD THAT WE PUT FORWARD. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT THE DEPARTMENT AYE YOU KNOW HAS BROUGHT FORWARD FOR QUITE A FEW BUDGET CYCLES NOW OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM THAT WE ARE ALL GRAPPLING WITH AN OF YOUR DUTY ARE YOU KNOW THAT IS. EXTREMELY HARD RIGHT NOW TO PULL THIS TOGETHER AND NEED TO TIME HERE IS THAT WE HAVE OR IN THE BUDGET- AND HAVE NO PROBLEM HOLDING OUR DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR LACK OF- YOU KNOW INCREASED ACCESS UTILIZATION. OF OUR ATHLETES NEEDED FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO UPDATING YOU ON REGARDS TO HOW WE'RE HOLDING THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. AS WELL AS UPDATES ON THE PROCUREMENT. AND I WANT TO ASK AND I GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. CAN CAN SOMEBODY DESCRIBE WAS OUT A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR ERROR THAT SOMEBODY. I MEAN DESCRIBE THE SHORTFALL FOR ME WHERE WHERE DID IT HOW DID ORIGINATE HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT OUT- CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE DENTIST THAT PROVIDED THE SERVICES- DID SEPARATE TAB DONE SO IN IN EXPECTATION OF BEING PAID. SO DID SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW NOT BALANCE THE CHECKBOOK I MEAN WHAT HAPPENED WHERE DID THAT WHERE THE SHORTFALL COME FROM WITH THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS IT AN ERROR. CAN SOME CAN YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. YES SO ONE I AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. NUMBER ONE IT'S THE ONE I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS AN ERROR I'M AGAIN IN THE WAIVER THE WAIVER WHAT THAT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE DTI WHAT WE WANT OUR THROUGH OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS EDUCATION OF OUR PROVIDERS IT BECAME VERY SEXY. SO THROUGH THAT SIXTH SENSE AND ALSO FOR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO- YOU KNOW ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON BENCHMARKS THAT ARE PROVIDERS WOULD MEET. AND IF WE STARTED TO SEE THAT WE WERE GOING TO GET ACT TO- THAT CAPPED ALLOTMENTS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THEN WE COULD DO PROGRAM TO KEEP. AGAIN WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND IT'S REALLY AND THAT LAST YEAR WHERE WE'RE NOW SEEING YOUR FOR THAT EXTENSION NEAR IN TERMS OF SEEN WHERE THE EXPENDITURES. THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DATE WHERE WERE STARTING TO SEE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THAT CAP ON THAT A LOT. AS THE TEAM HAS BEEN MONITORING BOTH INCOMING RECEIPTS AS WELL AS PROJECTED EXPENDITURES BASED UPON OUR PRIOR PERFORMANCE IS WHERE WE THEN RAISE THE SIGNAL THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HAVING A SHORTFALL SO WE HAD TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR PROVIDERS. WE ASK FOR THEM TO SUBMIT- CLAIMS INFORMATION FOR US TO THE END OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE CAN THEN MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF THAT SHORTFALL AND AGAIN- WHAT IT HAS BEEN AN ANTICIPATORY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE PROJECT IT. WAS THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SMEARS CARPET CONTINUING TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN EVALUATING THE- INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF. HAVE TO MAKE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS NOT MOVES BACK FOR ONE DOLLAR SO BASED UPON WHAT WE WERE ALLOWED TO EXPAND IT. UNDER THIS WAY BURKE I'M WITH THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY IS WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM AND NOW. FOR THE PART. AND IT GRANT PARK THAT PROGRAM AMOUNTS ARE BASED OF THE IN. PAYMENTS THAT THEY WANT OTHER BE IN. TO FOR THE SERVICES THEY ARE THE ANSWER FINANCE- THAT ARE WHAT'S BEING HELD BACK UNTIL SUCH THAT WE CAN BEING. THE HAVE FALLEN AVAILABLE AND THEN HOW THAT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED AMONGST. PROVIDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THE DOMAINS IN WHICH THAT WAS INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WOULD BE. I GUESS WHAT FEELS INHERENTLY UNFAIR IS THAT YOU THAT WE'VE GOT THIS INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE THEY PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND POTENTIALLY THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET PAID FOR SO THAT'S NOT AN INCENTIVE. ANY LONGER IT'S LIKE A BAIT AND SWITCH IT MEANS LIKE LIKE HAVING TO ASKING FOR A GLAZED DONUT GET A PLAIN ONE YOU KNOW I. MEAN I. LCDA BELIEVES IS AN ERROR IN THEIR PROVIDE SHOULD HAVE TO BE PENALIZED WITHOUT. ME YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE- YOU'RE SAYING IT'S NOT AN ERROR THAT PEOPLE WERE WARNED HOWEVER THEY WARNED AND WHEN WERE THEY WALL. AFTER THEY PROVIDED SERVICES. NO BUT THAT INFORMATION WAS ALWAYS IN THE SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THERE IS THE INFORMATION THAT IS IDENTIFIED ON THE REMITTANCE DETAILS SO WHEN THEY'RE SUBMITTING OUR CLAIMS. THERE ARE- LINE ITEMS ON THAT CLAIM THAT WILL SHOW LIKE- PAYMENT FOR- INSTEAD OF PAYING YOU KNOW LIKE THEIR REGULAR CLAIMS THAT OUR- PAYMENT FOR THE- INCENTIVE PAYMENT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A LINE THAT SAYS PROGRAM. AND TO DATE THAT PRO RATA SHARE. SOME TO SPEAK HAS ALWAYS BEEN. CELTICS THAT WE NOW HAVE TO DO A PROGRAM THAT PAYMENT IT WITHIN SHALL WE GET A WHAT THAT PROVIDER WOULD RECEIVE. WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR. THAT UNDER THE IDTI THERE IS A CAP THE LAW. YEAH IT WAS A FEDERAL WAIVER WE HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO EXPAND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE. OF THE FIVE YEAR WE REPAIR IT WITH THE- ADDITIONAL EXTENSION YEAR THEN WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR- THE AVAILABILITY OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. FOR REIMBURSEMENT PURPOSES OF THE PROVIDERS BUT UNDER THE FEDERAL LABOR IT IS A CAPPED A LOT SO ANYTHING THAT EXCEEDS THAT ALLOTMENT THEN WOULD BECOME AN OBLIGATION WITH EIGHT GENERAL FUND HOMES WE CANNOT DRIVE DOWN. THAT FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE DON'T. HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DRAW. I GUESS AND THE BIGGER POINT HERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW DENTIST. DISSIPATED IN THIS THROUGH BECAUSE OF THE INCENTIVE. AND INCENTIVE IS TO HELP BECAUSE THE COST TO WRITE CARE IS HIGHER THAN THAN. IT THAN WHAT THEY'RE TYPICALLY RE REIMBURSED FOR SO MY POINT HERE IS THAT IF YOU BURN US ARE YOU BURN NOT I SAYS A PROFESSION AND YOU WANT OFFER SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. GOOD LUCK. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT GONNA BE TRUST. PEOPLE ACTUALLY GONNA GET PAID FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. SO I WOULD URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER THE BACK FILL FOR THAT. AN HONOR THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM. THANK THANK YOU DOCTOR- MISS HOLLOW I'M GONNA STICK WITH YOU FOR A SECOND IF I CAN- EARLIER YOU HAD SAID THAT- IT PART OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR PLANT PERFORMANCE AND CONSIDER PRIOR PERFORMANCE- I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRIOR PERFORMANCE IS THE BEST PREDICTOR FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND SINCE WE HEARD ABOUT HOW THESE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE HAD LOWER UTILIZATION RATES FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THEY WILL REACH PARITY OR IS THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL BE READY FOR THE TRANSITION AND IF WE ARE TO TRANSITION CAN WE FOLLOW UP ON WHAT CDA HAD SAID FOR THE NEED FOR US TO HAVE CONTINUITY OF CARE TO COME UP WITH THE ROBUST TRANSITION PLAN HOPING TO- HAVE YOU PROVIDE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO AGAIN IN LOOKING AT BETTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS- WE DO QUESTION. IF THE PLANS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS COME THE END OF THE WEEK. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE NOT MET THOSE REQUIREMENTS THEN WE WILL START TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS FOR THE DESCENDANTS. AND TO THE EXTENT BASED UPON WHAT THAT WAS JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK LIKE THEN ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD THEN WORK TOWARDS- AT AN APPROPRIATE TRANSITION. ON AS YOU ALL MAY RECALL PREVIOUSLY ONE WE HAVE BUT THIS PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE- OUR BUDGET CYCLES. THE TEAM HAVE WORKED ON. A TRANSITION PLAN AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE THEN NEED TO EXECUTE ON THAT PLAN WE WOULD THEN LEVERAGE THAT AND WORK WITH YOU KNOW OUR BENEFICIARIES ARE PROVIDERS STAKEHOLDERS. AND TERMS OF THE IN THE EXECUTION OF THAT TRANSITION PLAN BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT. AND THEN START TO EXECUTE WITH THE NECESSARY STEPS BUT IT WOULD BE INFORMED BY A TRANSITION PLAN BASED UPON WHAT WE ARE SEEING HOW FAR. THAT PLAN AT THAT POINT IN TIME. I'M GONNA FALL UP ON- DA WOULD QUESTIONS ON THE DENTAL TRENDS. INITIATIVE IF I CAN IT SEEMS THAT. PART OF YOUR RESPONSE WAS THAT THE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE SINCE IT WAS NOT- PART OF THE CAPITAL. OUTLAY AT THE BEGINNING CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHAT WE BELIEVE THE STATE PORTION OF THAT SHORTFALL TO BE OUT OF THE FORTY MILLION THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS IT SIMPLY THAT WE CAN'T. PULL DOWN THE- FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS ARE IS THERE A STATE PORTION THAT WE SHOULD BE- AT A MINIMUM LOOKING TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REIMBURSING PROVIDERS WITH. IT TOUGH FORTY MILLION IS THE TOTAL SOLAR WOULD BE WITHOUT THAT FEDERAL. SO THAT WOULD BE COVERING BOTH THE STATE AND WHAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN THE CATALYST. WITH THE FEDERAL PARTICIPATION HOW MUCH OF THAT FORTY MILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AYE YOUR- ANSWER RIGHT THERE WAS THAT THE STATE IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THE FORTY MILLION- WHAT WAS IT. PRIOR TO THIS IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO. OH I'M SORRY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BASED UPON- SO FOR THE CHILDREN WE HAVE DIFFERENT FEDERAL MATCHING RATE. SO WOULD% BE ASED UPON THOSE THOSE FEDERAL MATCHING RATE SENT AS AN AVERAGE OF WITH LIKELY BEEN LIKE THAT. PROBABLY AT A SIXTY FORTY SPLIT BECAUSE WE GET A HIGHER MATCHING READ ON SOME OF OUR CHILDREN'S POPULATIONS I WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN WE HAVE TYPICALLY IT'S FIFTY FIFTY. AND THEN- IT THAT THE BALANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE UP BY THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS. IF MY MATH IS RIGHT THAT THEN IS THAT A MINIMUM SIXTEEN MILLION THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO CONTRIBUTE TO. ENSURE THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING- WHY WAS THERE NOT LEGISLATURE WAS AT THE APPLICATION PROCESS OR HOW COULD WE HAVE SUPPORTED TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE CONTINUING THESE INCENTIVES. I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES SO WE WERE OPERATING UNDER THE WEIGHT. SO UNDER THE WAIVER ITSELF IN TOTALITY THE WAIVER AND THE DTI PAYMENTS WERE CAPPED IN TOTALITY AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WE GET ALL OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND SO THAT IS FUNDED IN PART AND I WANT TO CORRECT MY STATEMENT SO IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S FIFTY FIFTY. SO WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED- FOR THAT THE STATE GENERAL FUND WHICH WE USE TO- OUR DISH THE FUNDING WHICH WAS FAR STATE DESIGNATED- HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT WE USE IN FACT. FINDING AND THE SAVINGS FROM THOSE STATE DESIGNATED HEALTH PROGRAMS WHERE WE COULD THEN CLAIM ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING TO MAKE UP THE BALANCE OF THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT. WE WOULD GET YOU KNOW- THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION STATE GENERAL FUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR THE ADDITIONAL YEAR ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE UP FOR THAT ADDITIONAL EXTENSION. SO AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE OPERATING UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE WAIVER WE ARE THEN CAPPED AT THE ADDITIONAL SETTLED HERE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO US AND SAID THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND SELL HALF OF THAT WOULD BE BORNE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HALF OF THAT WILL BE BORNE BY- THE STATE JOURNAL. SO LOOKING AT EXPENDITURES TO DATE.

WE WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO DATE TO CONSIDER ENCOURAGING THE HCI TO EXPAND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPONENT OF CAL IN RESTRICTING A BENEFIT RICH A BENEFICIARY'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE A MEDICARE DOOR ELIGIBLE SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN AT THE FACT. BEGINNING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND HEALTH CERTAIN NECESSARY BENCHMARKS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN ORDER TO ENSURE A CAREFUL AND JUDICIOUS TRANSITION OF THIS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE POPULATION. I WE HAVE SEEN PREVIOUS TRANSGRESSIONS INVOLVING SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM THE PATIENT CRAP PATIENT PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE. AND SOMETIMES IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR A PATIENT. CALLING IS AN AMBITIOUS AND FAR REACHING INITIATIVE THAT WAS SUPPORTED IN LARGE PART BY THE IN MAY LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS HURT BY THE LEGISLATURE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ACCOUNT. HOWEVER EACH YES IT'S ALREADY JUGGLING MANY COMPETING INITIATIVES AND PRIORITIES THAT MAY HOLD A THREAT TO BE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMMATIC DETAILS OF A TRANSITION OF DEATH BY THE CULT. AT A MINIMUM THERE WILL BE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THE MOST FRAIL ELDERLY SENIORS FORCED TO CHANGE THEIR HEALTH PLAN AND LIKELY THEIR PROVIDER IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AS WE SAW DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVES CCI IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVEMENT OF POSITION BOTH MINIMAL. AS A RESULT THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS THAT DESCEND ROLLED FROM THE CPI BECAUSE THEIR PROVIDER WAS NOT INVOLVED WITH. A MAGNETIC HOW MANAGED CARE PLANS. BETTER THAN ANY DOT UNDERSTAND THE AND- OF COORDINATING CARE ACT RIGHT COPULATION. RECOGNITION THAT A TRANSITION SUCH AS BACK ENVISIONED IN CALLING NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE NATURE OF THE AFFECTED POPULATION IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING ACCESS TO CARE.
