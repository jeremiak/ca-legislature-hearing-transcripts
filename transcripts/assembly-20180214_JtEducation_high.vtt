HOW THE LEGISLATURE ALSO

SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN THE

HEADED SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT PREDICTED THAT CONFLICT

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BETWEEN THE STATE BOARD AND THE

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPERINTENDENT WAS INEVITABLE.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT RECOMMENDED ABOLISHING THE

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:22.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
POSITION OF THE STATE

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPERINTENDENT AND REPLACING IT

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

OF THE LEGISLATURE NEVER TOOK UP

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT RECOMMENDATION BUT OVER THE

OTHER STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED AND

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
NAY I'VE MADE SIMILAR

NINETEEN TWENTY STUDY.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THREE CASES THE STATE GOT AS

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FAR AS PLACING A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AMENDMENT ON THE BALLOT BUT IN

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EACH CASE THE VOTERS ULTIMATELY

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REJECTED THE PROPOSED CHANGES.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:51.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO OVER THE PAST ONE HUNDRED

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE EDUCATION CODE. AND THE

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE BOARD COULD WAVE TO HIM AS

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IT COULD WITH ANY OTHER

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PROVISION OF LAW.

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SOME DISTRICTS ARE PUT TOGETHER

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:02.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY WAIVERS AND WENT TO THE

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:04.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE BOARD BUT THEN THE STATE

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BOARD DECLINED ISSUE THEM

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUING A DIFFERENT OPINION THAT

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOUND THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:09.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AUTHORITY TO WAIVE INITIATIVES

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:09.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
APPROVED BY THE

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:15.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
VOTERS.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I SAID TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:19.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIVE MAJOR STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KEY TWELVE GOVERNANCE AND MADE

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A FIREMAN.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:25.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I IN BROAD STROKES ALL OF THOSE

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:26.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CURRENTS

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ACTUALLY HAS SIGNIFICANT

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SHORTCOMINGS.

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THE FIRST MAJOR CONCERN WAS

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM A LACKS

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CLEAR LINES OF AUTHORITY AND

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESPONSIBILITY. HAVING MULTIPLE

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNANCE ENTITIES MEANS THE

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PUBLIC HAS DIFFICULTY HOLDING

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANY ONE ENTITY RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:44.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND RESULTS.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:45.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A THINK THAT LINE WAS A CONCERN

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS BEST EXPRESSED BY THE LINE

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE CHAIRMANSHIP AT THE

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BEGINNING.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
JUST THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REPORT A AYE WHICH CONCLUDED

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THE PROBLEM WITH STATE

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT EVERYONE IS IN CHARGE AND

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NO ONE IS ACCOUNTABLE.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STUDIES ALSO RAISED CONCERNS

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROMOTE COHERENT POLICY MAKING.

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THE GOVERNOR THEY NOTED THAT

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE BOARD ALL RELY ON THE

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:10.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPERINTENDENT IMPLEMENT THE

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POLICIES.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT IS

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ELECTED INDEPENDENTLY ANSWERABLE

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO A DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY AND

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:16.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MAY HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
PRIORITIES.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I FINALLY ALL OF THE STUDIES I.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:23.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CITED MANY EXAMPLES OF

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:24.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DUPLICATION FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GOVERNOR OFTEN APPOINTS

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THEIR OWN EDUCATION GOVERNOR'S

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:28.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OFTEN APPOINT THEIR OWN

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:30.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EDUCATION ADVISERS. WHOSE

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE VERY

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMILAR TO THOSE I DONE BY THE

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:38.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OF EDUCATION.

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT OF THE

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STUDIES I MAKE A SERIES OF

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:43.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OFF FIVE REALLY ENVISION A.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:49.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD BE THERE

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SORT OF CLEAR HEAD OF THE

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:53.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATE'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WHAT THAT TENDERLY GENERALLY

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:56.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TENDS TO MEAN IS THAT SOME OR

00:13:56.702 --> 00:13:58.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN ALL. OF THE POLICY MAKING

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:02.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT TDAY ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:03.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:05.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STATE BOARD AND OTHER AGENCIES.

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED INTO AN

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OFFICE THAT REPORTS TO THE

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:10.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
GOVERNOR.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:12.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I REGARDING THE SUPERINTENDENT

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE STUDY'S RECOMMENDATIONS

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:15.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY FOR A LONG SPECTRUM. ARE

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:16.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX STUDY

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:17.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CALLED FOR THE MOST DRAMATIC

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHANGE IT RECOMMENDED ABOLISHING

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE POSITION OF THE STATE

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SUPERINTENDENT.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND REPLACING IT AYE WITH

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMEONE WHO'D BE APPOINTED BY

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE GOVERNOR HOW TO PERFORM ALL

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BY THE OTHER TWO STUDIES

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECOMMENDED RETAINING ELECTED

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:33.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPERINTENDENT BUT MAKING THIS

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSITION RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I UNDER THIS AYE RECOMMENDATION

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SUPERINTENDENT WHICH REALLY

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ENVISIONED AS SORT OF AN

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INDEPENDENT VOICE FOR SCHOOL

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.117 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
IMPROVEMENT WITH SPECIFIC
DUTIES.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT MIGHT INCLUDE A COLLECTING

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND PUBLISHING ACCOUNTABILITY

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DATA. IDENTIFYING LOW BUT LOW

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERFORMING SCHOOLS OVERSEEING

PERFORMING.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AT THE FINAL TWO STUDIES

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RECOMMENDED MORE MODEST CHANGES

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO THEIR PROPOSALS I RETAIN THE

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUPERINTENDENT TWIST MUCH OF THE

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSITIONS CURRENTLY ALL. I WITH

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:09.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOME REFINEMENTS TO CLARIFY

TRANSFORM TO THE GOVERNOR.

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE

SPECTRUM I TO STUDY IS

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:23.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
RECOMMENDED COMPLETELY

I TO ABOUT ONE STUDY ENVISIONED

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT NARROWING THE BOARD'S

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AUTHORITY BY ELIMINATING BOTH OF

EXPLICITLY ASSIGNED TO IT.

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:46.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND I THE FINAL TWO STUDIES

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:47.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RECOMMENDED MAINTAINING THE

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BOARDS CURRENT GOAL AS A

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:49.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

OF OUR HAND OUT LET ME LEAVE YOU

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:58.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WITH JUST A FEW CLOSING.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THOUGHTS AS YOU THINK ABOUT

00:16:00.192 --> 00:16:01.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POTENTIAL GOVERNANCE CHANGES.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THE FIRST IS THAT THERE ARE

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOME CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOUR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE KEY

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTORS IN THE SYSTEM. OF THE

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSTITUTION REQUIRES BOTH THE

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
STATE BOARD AND STATE

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:12.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

INSTRUCTION.

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:15.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE VERY

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BROAD AUTHORITY TO CHANGE THE

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THOSE ENTITIES.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEARLY ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE GOVERNANCE RANGING FROM

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:23.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE METHOD OF SELECTING THE

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE BOARD TO SPECIFIC DUTIES

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF EACH ENTITY. AYE THINGS THAT

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YOU COULD CHANGE THROUGH

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MODIFYING STATUTE.

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:32.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND FINALLY. CONSIDER YOUR TRADE

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OFFS.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THE PRINCIPLE I THINK BEST

00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:36.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:37.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS A

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:40.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIFFUSION OF EXECUTIVE POWER. I

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MOST BY DESIGN THE CURRENT

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:43.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SYSTEM REQUIRES ALL OF THE MAIN

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTORS TO AGREE ON MOST MAJOR

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
POLICY CHANGES.

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT THE FIVE STUDIES HAVE

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:50.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADVISE YOU TO DO BY CONTRAST IS

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOCUSED MORE? ON SOME OTHER

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRINCIPLES LIKE HAVING CLEAR

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LINES OF AUTHORITY BY HAVING

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSPARENT DECISION MAKING AND

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ELIMINATING ARE OVERLAPPING

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
FUNCTIONS.

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO WITH THAT OVERVIEW I CHAIR

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:03.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUMBERS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
QUESTIONS.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WELL THANK YOU.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:09.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT EVEN WE START WITH ONE.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RELATING TO THESE THESE STUDIES.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:16.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
HAN.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:17.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THIS PARTICULAR STUDY THAT

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASKED FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BOARD'S POLICY MAKING POWERS

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:21.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RECONSTITUTION AS AN ADVISORY

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BODY.

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:26.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHO WOULD THEN MAKE POLICY THE

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POLICIES UNDER THAT STEADY WHO

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WOULD THEN MAKE THE POLICIES?

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:30.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ARE CURRENTLY MADE BY THE

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BOARD. THOSE STUDIES ENVISIONED

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:34.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD A POINT

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:36.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO HEAD OF AN AGENCY SAME WAY

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH OUR THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE HEADS OF OTHER AGENCIES AND

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:40.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT PERSON WOULD LEAD UP.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NICELY A NEW AGENCY WITH THAT

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KIND OF POLICY MAKING AUTHORITY.

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSIDER THE WHOLE IDEA THAT IT

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS IT'S JUST ASKING THE BROADER

00:17:47.966 --> 00:17:49.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTION OF WHY IT IS THAT WE

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE THE SEPARATE BOARD. MAKING

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DECISIONS WHEN IN OTHER AREAS OF

00:17:52.871 --> 00:17:54.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
POLICY MAKING ITS DONE.

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:57.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN A MORE HIGHER HOPE ROACH.

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH SO THAT MEAN THAT'S A GOOD

00:17:58.644 --> 00:17:59.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUESTION AND PUBLIC HAS ITS

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ROOTS.

00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:02.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOW ALL THE WAY BACK IN IN

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE BUT. ON THAT

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DELEGATES AT THAT TIME SEEM

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO WANT SOME. DISPERSION OF

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POWER THEY WERE CONCERNED AYE

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:11.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT JUST EDUCATION BUT IN OTHER

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AREAS OF THE BUDGET.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ABOUT POWER BECOMING TOO

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:16.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONCENTRATED IN ANY ONE AREA.

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:19.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'M.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IN SOME. OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE LATER

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:23.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSOLIDATED THAT BUT IN THE

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CASE OF EDUCATION IT'S ONE WHERE

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:26.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE VOTERS HAVE REALLY NOT GONE

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:28.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR ANY MAJOR CHANGES. TO THAT

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:33.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM SINCE THAT TIME HONOR.

THIRD OF AND DID YOU HAVE A

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

LOOKING AT SALACIOUS BETWEEN THE

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

AT THIS AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:56.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
S. REPORTS.

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:57.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT'S THE IMPACT THEN DOES THAT

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:00.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SORT OF DOWNSTREAM WE HAVE. NO

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEN OF

COURSE YOU. DON'T TO THE

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FRONTLINE TEACHERS AND

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:07.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THIS SORT OF CONFUSION AT THE

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
TOP.

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEN LEADS TO LET ME CONTINUE AT

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:16.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NW HAD CHEST EXPLORED THIS

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:19.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT.

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:20.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ULTIMATELY OF COURSE WERE

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCERNED ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:23.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR CHILDREN SO. IS THIS BASIS

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:25.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT HAPPENS THE TOP LACK OF

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CLARITY THESE FIGHTS THEY'VE HAD

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
WHAT WHAT WHAT THEN.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEADS TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:33.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON FOLKS

00:19:33.138 --> 00:19:35.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROBABLY CAN'T YOU KNOW I DON'T

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH TEXTBOOK TO GET THAT. NO

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:39.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WHO KNOWS. THERE'S NO RATING

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:40.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM FOR KIDS CAN CAN YOU

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:41.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SPEAK TO THAT.

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:42.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:43.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ALL OF

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE STUDIES ARE LOOKED AT AS

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WELL AND I THINK I SHOULD

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MENTION THAT MANY OF THE US

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOVERNMENT STUDIES. PATTON

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALTHOUGH THEY'VE FOCUSED ON OUR

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE GOVERNANCE MANY OF THEM

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAD SIMILAR CONCERNS ABOUT LACK

00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF CLARITY AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR EXAMPLE. THAT WE NOTED I'M

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECENTLY THAT THE MISSION OF THE

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:00.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COUNTY OFFICES IS REALLY UNCLEAR

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO THAT'S AN AREA OF LOCAL

FOR SOME OF THE STUDIES SAID BUT

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM AS

THEY FELT LIKE THEY SOMETIMES

PRIORITIES.

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:38.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE ARE CLEARLY THAT IT LEADS

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO CONFUSION LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

BUT DIRECTION AND AND THAT SOON

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THERE MIGHT EVEN BE SOME

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT EXAMPLE OF

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

HOW INDEPENDENT IS THE STATE

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BORDER APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SICKLY WHAT'S THE TO TURN OVER

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRADITION OF THE OF THE STATE

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:17.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BOARD I MEAN IF THEY'RE

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:19.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ESSENTIALLY DIRECT TOOLS OF THE

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNOR ARE DO THEY HAVE SOME

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENOUGH SOME INDEPENDENCE IN THE

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SENSE THAT TO OTHER APPOINTEES.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
YOU HAVE LIKE.

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:28.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THEIR TERMS AND.

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND SO YOU DON'T DO NOT

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GOVERNMENT COMING IN AND

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLEANING HOUSE ESSENTIALLY IF

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:34.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THE

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNOR HOW. SO EXACTLY HOW

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:37.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
INDEPENDENT

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
STATE BOARD.

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:40.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION TWO THERE I

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD SAY MADE MORE INDEPENDENT

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:43.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SAY THE HEAD OF AN AGENCY.

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BUT NOT.

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:46.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FAR LESS INDEPENDENT IN THE

00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:48.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:49.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IS THE STATE

00:21:49.941 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PART MEMBERS SERVE FOUR YEAR

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
STAGGERED TERMS.

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:55.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I SAW WHEN I GOVERNOR I'M COMING

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:57.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND HAS A CHANCE TO SORT OF.

00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:59.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
NAME NEW.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:00.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEMBERS THE STATE BOARD OVER THE

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
YEARS.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THE STATE BOARD ALSO HAS A

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY CHOOSE A THEY ELECT THEIR

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OWN HEAD OF THE STATE BOARD SO

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:07.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEY CHOOSE WAS GOING TO

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:10.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REPRESENT THEM. I'M KEY ISSUES

00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:13.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THEY DO HAVE THEIR OWN ON

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:13.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ITS RELATIVELY SMALL WHAT TO DO

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT IT BUT DOESN'T STAFF

00:22:14.833 --> 00:22:16.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEMBERS WHO WORK FOR THEM. SO

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SOME INDEPENDENCE BUT NAM

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:20.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT'S JUST MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPERINTENDENT IS COMPLETELY

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INDEPENDENT OF THAT STRUCTURE.

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THE CLEAR FIVE WELL THE BOARD

00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAS A SMALL STAFF TECHNICALLY

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:29.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT YET IT'S THAT THEY DON'T

00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:30.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HAVE CONTROL OVER TO

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:31.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUPERINTENDENT TO ACTUALLY.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OVERSEAS

00:22:33.218 --> 00:22:34.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LARGER STAFF THE DEPARTMENT

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:36.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YES EXECUTABLE WORDS POLICIES

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:39.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YEAH SOME OF THE STAFFING I

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:41.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THINK IT'S BEEN.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SORT OF FATAH MOVEMENT THE LAWS

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:45.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
A LITTLE BIT NAM.

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOME WAYS UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW THAT

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORKS IN THE SUPERINTENDENT. AYE

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:51.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS DIRECTED TO HAVE SORT OF

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:52.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CONTROL OF.

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF ALL OF THOSE STAFF OF SAY THE

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:55.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT THE

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK

00:22:56.842 --> 00:22:58.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE STATE BOARD.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:00.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO KIND OF WHERE THE LINE IS

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BETWEEN THE STATE POINTS GENERAL

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AUTHORITY AND THE SUPERINTENDENT

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:05.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY.

00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:06.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT'S ABOUT LESS CLEAR AND

00:23:06.718 --> 00:23:08.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRACTICE AND THE GOVERNOR IN

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:10.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RELATION TO ALL OF THIS THE

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STAFF AT CD IS ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THE SUPERINTENDENT.

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO GOV GOVERNOR HAS A ROLE IN

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:16.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT I MEAN THAT'S THE GOVERNOR

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:17.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT STATE BOARD BUT ASIDE FROM

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE BOARD DIRECTLY BETWEEN

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GOVERNOR AND THE CD STAFF.

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:22.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT LOSS WE HAVE BEEN DOING

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS PRESENTATIONS SAY TEN YEARS

00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:25.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGO THE SITUATION MIGHT HAVE

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEEN EVEN MORE CONFUSED BECAUSE

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:28.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE STATE USED TO HAVE A

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:30.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION.

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:31.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WHO WAS REALLY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POLICY STAFF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:33.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOT OF FORMER ROLAND LA. BUT BY

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVING THE GOVERNOR'S YEAR THEY

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:36.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
EXERCISE A LOT OF.

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:38.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF POLICY I TODAY WE DON'T HAVE

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A STRUCTURE LIKE THAT MOST OF

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FORMER. HOT WHEELS OF THAT I

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WERE

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:49.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE BOARD.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON BUT IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANOTHER GOVERNOR COULD APPOINT.

00:23:53.165 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT BRING BACK THAT POSITION AND

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:15.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE VARYING ALTERNATIVE METHODS

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:18.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE PRIMARILY RELATE TO STATE

THE SUPERINTENDENT'S ROLE.

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:24.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LOCAL LEVEL.

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT NOT TOO MUCH ON. LIMITED TO

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTHING IN THESE MODELS LE. HAS

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCLUDES THE STATE LEGISLATURE

DEPARTMENT OF THAT.

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PALM IT'S A STARTING POINT FOR

POLICY AREAS.

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:01.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

PITCH.

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:17.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
BUT LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:18.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE'S NO BEST MODEL THAT WE

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:20.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

HAVE MORE CHALLENGES.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT WE'VE EVER HAD SO AGAIN IS

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:13.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

MODEL ONCE MODEL TO IT WAS JUST

00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A SIMPLE ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THE

BUT. WE CAN BE VERY DIRECTIVE

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:51.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY CONTROLADA

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:03.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SELF AND IF YOU ANYONE LOOKED AT

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ARE YOU CAN COMMENT ON ON

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HOUSE THE STRUCTURE MAY

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:07.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CORRELATE WITH RELATIONSHIP

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:09.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BETWEEN THE STATES AND SCHOOL

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISTRICTS OR WHATEVER LOCAL

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:12.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENTITY GOVERNS EDUCATION IN THAT

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:14.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PARTICULAR STATE.

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DONE SO AGAIN THIS ISN'T AN AREA

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S BEEN WIDELY STUDIED SO IN

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:19.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TERMS OF.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE IMMEDIATE QUESTION OF

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHETHER THERE'S A CORRELATION

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BETWEEN A LOCAL STRUCTURE IN THE

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
STATE'S STRUCTURE.

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:26.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:28.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:32.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND A LOT OF THE WAY. OF STATE

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:33.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND LOCAL STRUCTURES HAVE

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DEVELOPED HAVE NOT BEEN.

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:36.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SO MUCH.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTENTIONAL DECISIONS BUT JUST

00:45:38.335 --> 00:45:39.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAIT THE WAY THINGS HAVE EVOLVED

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OVER TIME. I WILL POINT TO.

00:45:42.206 --> 00:45:44.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE STUDY TO SORT OF ADDRESS

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:45.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE CENTRALIZATION VERSUS LOCAL

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CONTROL.

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:51.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHERE? PERHAPS IN THAT THE

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:52.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DICHOTOMY NEED ISN'T.

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:53.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOLY RELEVANT ANYMORE IN THE

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:55.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SENSE THAT IT THERE'S NO STATE

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S ENTIRELY LOCAL CONTROL

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:58.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND ENTIRELY CENTRALIZE BUT.

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
ON.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE STUDY I'M REFERRING TO

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:04.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ASSESS WHETHER CENTRALIZATION

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HELPS DO NOW COMES VERSES A

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOCAL CONTROL. AND WHAT THEY

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOUND WAS ESSENTIALLY DONE YOU

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE TO BE MORE NUANCED ABOUT

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WHAT YOU WANT THE STATE

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTROLLING HIM WAT YOU WANT OF

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LOCAL DISTRICTS CONTROLLING.

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:18.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ON AND AT THE END OF THE DAY IT

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:21.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SORT OF COME SOUND TO.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT ALLOWS A? LOCAL DISTRICTS

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO FOCUS ON STUDENTS AND WHAT

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:26.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ASPECTS.

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:29.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAN THE STATE'S TAKE OFF ON THE

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:29.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DISTRICTS MY A PLATE.

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:34.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE. OTHER QUESTION IS IN

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RELATION TO. ITEM IT'S YOU'RE

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:37.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
LOOKING AT THESE.

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:41.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOB SO YOU MADE THE COMMENT THAT

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:42.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR EXAMPLE MODEL ONE WHERE

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BASICALLY THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:44.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EVERYBODY.

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:47.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT IT'S YOU

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:49.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW DODD VT DIRECTION EDUCATION

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:51.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POLICY DEPENDS ON WHAT PRIORITY

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:52.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE GOVERNOR GIVES OF THE

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:52.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
GOVERNOR.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKES A VERY LOW PRIORITY THEN

00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:57.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
IF THERE'S.

00:46:57.848 --> 00:46:59.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
VERY LITTLE EMPHASIS RIGHT.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:00.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IF THE GOVERNMENT'S A HIGH

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:01.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRIORITY TO DRIVE A LOT OF

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHANGE BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS GOOD

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:03.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
POINT.

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:04.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO I I GUESS THE THE THE

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:07.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTION IS IS THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS ACTUALLY LOCAL AREAS AS

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WELL SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT.

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
pPOPULACE.

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:17.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF EDUCATION IS SEPARATED FROM

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LET'S SAY THE GOVERNOR AND

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALLEGE THE OF THE GOVERNOR.

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
DE DO YOU SEE.

00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:26.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:29.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BEING I WOULD

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAY LESS INTERESTED BUT LESS

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENGAGED AND THEREFORE WHEN WE

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EASE AFFECT EDUCATION NOT JUST.

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
EDUCATION DIRECTLY

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:39.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU SEE LESS COORDINATION BUT

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAY BETWEEN EDUCATION AND OTHER

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:44.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTS OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS.

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AB BECAUSE THOSE.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOLKS ARE SEPARATED AND A LATE

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT NIGHT BLADES GIVE YOU MAY

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:52.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRESS LOCALS AND SOMETIMES FOR

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:53.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN MARES WHO

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:54.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DON'T OVERSEE THEIR LOCAL

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EDUCATION TRIED INSERT

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEMSELVES IN EDUCATION. AT

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:58.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TIMES.

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE BATES FEEL THAT THAT'S

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING THAT THE THEIR DIALECT

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OR YOU COULD HAVE SAVED YOU

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:08.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE OFFICIALS AND SAY WELL YOU

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:09.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW EDUCATION ISN'T PART OF

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MIND IT SEPARATELY ELECTED

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:12.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SEPARATELY APPOINTED WHATEVER

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:16.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH IT'S

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:18.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT AND THEY JUST GO OFF ON THEIR

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:20.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OWN SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HOW THE STRUCTURES THAN

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
INFLUENCE

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:25.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HOPE WHAT PRIORITY A.

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:26.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNOR MAKES EDUCATION SO

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:28.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S THE PARTNER THE PART

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ABOUT WELL IF EVER IF

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERYTHING'S APPOINTED BY THE

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNMENT IS A

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CARE ABOUT EDUCATION THAT CARE

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:34.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT DOESN'T A HIGH PRIORITY

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TACTIC LANGUISH BUT ALSO A

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SERIOUS SITUATION WHERE. THE

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:39.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAVE OVERSIGHT

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER IS IS ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OF

00:48:41.184 --> 00:48:44.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION ARTS ARE PARSED OUT

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TODAY AND THERE'S LESS.

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF A DESIRE ARE LESS. INTERESTED

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN ARE AT IT IN IN BAD AND THE

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:52.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOVERNOR AND TRYING TO PURSUE

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
EDUCATIONAL PRIORITIES.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:54.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:55.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE LESS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:59.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO AGAIN IT'S LOW DIFFICULT TO

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:03.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SAY JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR ISN'T

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MUCH RESEARCH ON THIS AYE. I

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEAN WHEN I SAY THERE IS A OF

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE GOVERNOR MAY BE LESS

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:10.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTERESTED I THINK THEY MAY BE

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LESS INTERESTED IN THE SENSE

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THEY CAN. MOON MAY OR MAY

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT HAVE LIKE MORE AMBITIOUS

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:16.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PLANS FOR WHERE THEY SEE THE

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EDUCATION SYSTEM GOING I THINK

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:20.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S A HILL LEAST AT THE STATE

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:20.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
LEVEL EDUCATE.

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:21.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
K. TWELVE IS

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:23.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:23.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUDGET SO THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TO HAVE.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SOME INTEREST IN AND.

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:29.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT I THINK WHERE IF.

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO ANSWER THE BEST I CAN THE

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
ONLY.

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE DISTINCTION WILL BE WHETHER

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:33.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THEY CARE ABOUT.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:35.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
YOU KNOW TAKING A.

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:38.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR INSTANCE IN COLORADO LIKE.

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:40.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
P. THREE READING AND THE.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OR DOES SOMETHING A BIG POLICY

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INITIATIVE LIKE THAT THAT'S

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:45.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHERE YOU'LL SEE THAT

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
DISTINCTION.

00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:49.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE PERHAPS

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
MORE WORK TO.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LET INFORMED DECISIONS MIGHT BE

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:53.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
NECESSARY YES

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
STATE OF.

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:00.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THANKS FOR A FOR THE

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:02.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRESENTATION I SOCIAL TO FOLLOW

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:02.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
UP ON CHAIR.

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
O'DONNELL'S QUESTIONS EYES SO I

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:05.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I BELIEVE YOU SAID THERE IS NO

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REAL EVIDENCE OUT THERE IS TO.

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:09.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO RELIABLE POINT TO WHETHER

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:13.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONE OF THESE FOUR PREVAILING

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:13.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MODELS WORKS BUT AND OTHERS THAT

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:14.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
RIGHT.

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO CALIFORNIA WERE TO MAKE.

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME SORT OF CHANGE THAT WOULD

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:20.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT BE ON THE BASIS OF REALLY

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:22.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANY RELIABLE EXISTING EVIDENCE.

00:50:22.252 --> 00:50:24.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT ANY QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I'M AWARE OF. A CAT. AND SO

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I WON THE RECOMMENDATIONS I

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:28.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK WAS TO ESTABLISH AYE

00:50:28.325 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
METRICS GOING FORWARD IF WE WERE

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:32.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO CREATE OUT WORD BEFORE FOR

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE CHANGE A MANY SIDED ONE

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STUDY THAT HAD. SOMEONE I THINK

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:36.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DESCRIBES METRICS BUT THERE SEEM

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE MORE TO ME LIKE IDEALS

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:39.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE SIMPLICITY AND THINGS LIKE

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:40.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT SO DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:43.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RECOMMENDATIONS UP FOR WHAT

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:43.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE METRICS OUGHT TO BE.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
UN

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DO THINK.

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
GOING BACK.

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:50.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN TERMS OF THE SALAS SHIRLEY

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:52.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ESTABLISHING A GOAL OR VISION

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO ACCOMPLISH

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:54.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING SO. I

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE.

00:50:58.021 --> 00:51:00.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS THERE'S YOUR* CONSTANTLY

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:02.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOUNCING PRIORITIES SO DO YOU

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WANT THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE MORE EFFICIENT YOU WANT TO

00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:07.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE MORE TRANSPARENT YOU WANT.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BETTER CHECKS AND BALANCES THESE

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:51:11.334 --> 00:51:15.806 align:middle line:74% position:50% size:70%
DICTATE WHETHER YOU WANT TO
MAKE-A CHANGE OR YOU WANT TO
JUST.

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UP PERHAPS PROVIDE MORE CLARITY

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:17.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IN.

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:20.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXISTING ROLES OR SOMETHING

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:23.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIKE THAT SO. ON MY SUGGEST IF I

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAD IS SUGGESTION IT'S SIMPLY

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:26.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
JUST TO.

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:29.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:31.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONSIDER WHAT YOU HOPE TO

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACCOMPLISH BEFORE MAKING ANY

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:33.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CHANGES AND THEN.

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DETERMINE WHAT THE KEY METRICS

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILL BE FROM THERE BECAUSE IT'S

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
REALLY HARD TO ASSESS.

00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:41.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
WHAT EVEN?

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
HOW YOU WOULD?

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
QUANTIFY A GOOD GOVERNMENT

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SYSTEM JUST BECAUSE.

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN A LOT OF CASES THESE ARE

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:47.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
BASED ON.

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:50.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VALUES JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW YOU

00:51:50.207 --> 00:51:52.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WANT THE EXISTING LOCAL AND

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:54.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
STATE DYNAMIC TO BE OR.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:57.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT YOU WANT STUDENT OUTCOMES

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO HOPEFULLY LOOK LIKE IN THE

00:51:58.748 --> 00:51:59.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FUTURE AND HOW THE STATE WILL

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:07.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SUPPORT IT?

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WELL APPRECIATED I ALSO WANT TO

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:11.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOT OF EXCELLENT FIFTY STATE

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REVIEW THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S AND EVANS PACKETS AND I

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:16.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK SOME OF THE MEMBERS AN

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OPPORTUNITY REVIEW IT EARLIER

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:19.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT BASICALLY OUTLINES MOST

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:21.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF WHICH YOU PRESENTED.

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:21.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT HE'S VERY STRUCTURES AND

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
DOWN.

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
YOU KNOW IT'S A.

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMPLES OF THERE'S NO PERFECT

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:29.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WAY TO DO THIS SO WE DO

COMING TO US WITH THESE REYES

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MODELS AND I THINK THAT TERADATA

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HAS A DISMAL COMMENT IS A

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:37.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMENT HERE JUST KIND OF. THIS

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:40.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS JUST I'M GONNA ME THINKING

00:52:40.156 --> 00:52:40.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH LESSONS THEY READ OUT WHAT

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:15.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEY HAD TO READ STUDENTS

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
LITERALLY SAT.

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN A ON A CARPET AND ALL HAD A

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:20.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NUMBER IT WAS VERY REGIMENTED.

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:22.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE TRIED THAT APPROACH AND IT

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:24.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
DIDN'T WORK.

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT WE DID WAS WE WE MICROMANAGE

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROM SACRAMENTO SO ON TO BE

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.673 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T THINK
THAT.

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:32.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WORKS BECAUSE WE TRIED IT.

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:33.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND NOW WE'RE UNDER THE ERA OF

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:34.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL CONTROL

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDING FORMULA COUNTRY YOU'RE

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FAMILIAR WITH.

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:38.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IT'S UST PER WORD WE'RE

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:39.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRYING ANOTHER APPROACH WERE

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRYING TO GET THERE. BUT I JUST

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:42.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:43.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE CAN DO ONE THING WE CAN DO IN

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:46.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SACRAMENTO.

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:47.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TO MAKE.

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:49.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAKE EVERY CHILD SUCCESSFULLY

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:50.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS CANNOT

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:52.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAPPEN IN THE CLASSROOM IT'S

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:53.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOTTA HAPPEN AT LOCAL LEVEL. AND

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT CAN'T ALL BE DRIVEN FROM

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SACRAMENTO.

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ED I JUST ONE OF THE THING TO

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:04.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT OUT ON. A DATE DUBS AGREE

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITH THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS.

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:07.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE OF THEM TO POINT AS THE YOU

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALSO MEDITATING ONLY THIRTY FOR

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE STATE'S FIT INTO ONE OF THE

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:11.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOUR MODELS YOU DESCRIBED.

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
BUT THERE OF COURSE.

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIXTEEN OTHER STATES AND AND I

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:16.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK YOU LAME OUT PRETTY NICELY

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:17.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR REPORT

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:20.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHER GOVERNMENTS MODELS AND THE

00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:22.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE BUT WITH A. RANGE FROM.

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:24.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:25.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPEAKER APPOINTING MEMBERS THE

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STATE BOARD AS THEY DO IN

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:28.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MISSISSIPPI RIGHT THE WAY OVER

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO THE COME HYBRID MODELS WHERE

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
YOU'VE GOT.

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PART OF THE BOARD ELECTED PART

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE BOARD APPOINTED AS A LOT

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF DIFFERENT IDEAS OUT THERE BUT

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:38.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TEN BUT ULTIMATELY AFRAID I MEAN

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:38.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
IT'S IT'S.

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I GUESS THE QUESTION WE HAVE IS

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:41.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOW DO YOU CREATE A STRUCTURE

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THAT WILL PASSED.

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:57.761 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
ALLOW FOR THE THE SORT OF I GOT
YOU A FLOWERING FITTED TO.

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:58.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S ALSO JUST GIVE I COULD

00:54:58.461 --> 00:54:58.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
JUST IF WE GO BACK TO HISTORY

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBABLY PRE PROP THIRTEEN THE

00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:00.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DYNAMIC IN SACRAMENTO WAS

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:01.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROBABLY VERY DIFFERENT.

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:02.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE THE FUNDING MODEL WAS

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT MOST OF THE MONEY CAME

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:04.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
APPROVED CAME FROM THE LOCAL

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
LEVEL.

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:06.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO EVEN LOCALS PROBABLY DIDN'T

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
SEE GOVERNANCE

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:09.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OR A MUCH INPUT FROM THE

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SACRAMENTO LEVEL NOW THAT

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SACRAMENTO'S IN CHARGE OF THE

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOLLARS THEY'RE SEEKING TO HAVE

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:18.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MUCH GREATER SAID.

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:20.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH YEAH CENTER PAN THAT THAT'S

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:21.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PART OF REASON I ASKED MY FIRST

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:24.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT QUESTION IS IS THAT YOU

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:29.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE YOUR CLASS FIND STATES

00:55:29.092 --> 00:55:30.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DIFFER MODELS BUT. SOME OF IT

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS TO DO WITH WILL HOW DO YOU

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:34.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STRUCTURE THE WHOLE.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THING IN THE STATE MUST RELATION

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:35.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BETWEEN THE STATE THE LOCALS

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FUNDING OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEVERS OF FOR. PAUL AND I AND I

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:40.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THINK THE OTHER.

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:41.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISSUE IS YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU SAID WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DATA

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:46.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ON WHICH MY LIFE BUT ALSO THAT

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BAGS LIKE TO IS THE DATE EVEN

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:49.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
OUT THERE IF WE HAD A
RESEARCHER.

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IT WENT IT DO WE HAVE

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:51.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERFORMANCE DATA ETCETERA. DO

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:55.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DOES THE PUBLIC IN THE EACH

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE WITH DIFFERENT MODELS

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:57.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WHICH

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:58.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY. ADD

00:55:59.022 --> 00:55:59.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

RECOGNIZING THAT ACTUAL

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:05.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPLEMENTATION TAKING PLACE AT

MAKING PROGRESS ON THEM OR NOT

THAT.

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:24.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOW DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA. ARE

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:25.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:28.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RECOMMENDATION TO CHANGE THE

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:29.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SIMPLIFY AT AND MAKE IT MORE

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:32.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TRANSPARENT AT TRANSPARENT

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SO AND THIS IS BEEN.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BROUGHT UP BY GOVERNOR'S

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ATTORNEYS GENERAL THE

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:42.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATURE ON THE COURTS AND

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ALL WHO SEEMS SORT OF A

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BALKANIZED STRUCTURE.

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:47.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND WE'RE NOT COMING YEAR JASON

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BECAUSE

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE BELIEVE YOU ARE THE FOLKS WHO

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:50.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN COME UP WITH THE OVERALL

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:52.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THAT. BUT

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM HAS BLURRED LINES OF

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND PLENTY OF OF

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ROOM FOR MUCH GREATER

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TRANSPARENCY EFFICIENCY AND

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:03.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HONESTLY WHERE CONSTITUENTS AND

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOUR VOTERS AND THE PEOPLE THAT

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:06.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STATE KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO. WE WE BELIEVE NUMBER ONE

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THIS IS BEEN SEEN FOR YEARS

01:02:11.627 --> 01:02:13.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND AND NUMBER TWO THIS IS THE

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TIME. WE THINK THIS IS THE

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOMENT THE EVEN TAKE TIME TO TRY

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TO FIX THIS. ARMED.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE THINK THAT YOU ALL AS THE

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:23.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATURE IN IN A BY CAMEL WAY

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN DO JUST THAT COUPLE OF FOR

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:26.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
OF THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:29.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TIME AND THE FACT THAT BOTH THE

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
GOVERNOR. AND.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THIS HAS P. IRE ARE LEAVING

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OFFICE HAVE CAN HAVE AB IT

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:36.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PLEASE THROUGH THEIR STAFFS

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GIVEN US THEIR DIRECT TALKS

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT. HOW THE ALBUM GOING

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FORWARD THIS COULD BE DONE BUT

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ALSO THE IT'S?

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOU I WOULD ARGUE AND AFTER

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:46.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CONVERSATION WITHOUT EVER

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:47.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LAST YEAR WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:48.965 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE
SYSTEM.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DAVID EIGHT IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:51.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS YEAR IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR ANOTHER TEN OR TWENTY YEARS

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND IT MAY NEVER HAPPEN. AND

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:57.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS IS A UNIQUE MOMENT FOR THE

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.342 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THE LEAD.
ON.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:00.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND BOTTOM LINE I THINK OUR

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:02.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
POINT IS THAT IF YOU FOR

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:05.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIMPLIFY AND STREAMLINE THAT THE

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEN SOME OF THE TOP DOWN

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCOUNTABILITY MANDATES LIKE NO

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHILD LEFT BEHIND ME I I HEARD

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE. I'M

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MISTER KILEY ABOUT ABOUT TOP

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:18.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOWN MICRO MANAGING THAT OR. WE

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT EITHER

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND ACTUALLY WE BELIEVE THAT. A

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A SMART GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL PROVIDE MUCH MORE BOTTOMS

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:27.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
UP ACCOUNTABILITY AS OPPOSED

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:28.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POST WHEN COMBINED WITH LCF

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OFTEN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:03:30.139 --> 01:03:31.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT HAVE

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:32.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OCCURRED OVER THE PAST SEVEN OR

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:32.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
EIGHT YEARS.

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PALM.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND AND LITTLE ELIMINATES

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:36.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CERTAIN BYZANTINE GOVERNMENT

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRUCTURES THAT CAN GET ON THE

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAY WORK REQUIRED THE STATE. AND

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND AND LOCAL I. DISTRICT

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SUSPEND WAY TOO MUCH TIME AND

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:46.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RESOURCES ON. INEFFICIENT DIED

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
BY COMPLICATED.

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:50.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
STRUCTURES AND LACK OF

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:52.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACCOUNTABILITY UP BY THE WASTE

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN GENTLY I THINK AND WE'RE

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER WITNESSES. THAT THIS ON

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:57.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ULTIMATELY ALSO BENEFIT EARLY

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHILDHOOD AND. ALL OF YOU ALL

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU CARE ABOUT

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KIDS AN EDUCATION AND OBVIOUSLY.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD SITUATION

01:04:05.374 --> 01:04:06.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CONCERN OF FIVE IS GONNA

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LATE LEAD INTO THEIR ABILITY TO

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:10.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL TILL AND

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHANGE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING.

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:16.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WILL IN FACT ALSO IN YOUR TO

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE BENEFIT OF BY STREAMLINED

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:22.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE EFFICIENT EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:23.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SYSTEM IN THE STATE.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT PART OF

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSAL WAS

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PRETTY FUNNY TODAY. AND LASTLY

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:27.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:27.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHANGING THE ROLE OF THE S. P.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:28.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AYE WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSAL'S STRIKES ME AS P. AYE.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:32.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT OF THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHERS ON. BUT AT THE END OF THE

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DAY A MORE ACCOUNTABLE EFFICIENT

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIMPLE SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE IT'S CLEAR WHO'S IN CHARGE

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN IT'S CLEAR WHO THE PEOPLE CAN

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. IS GONNA BE A

01:04:43.579 --> 01:04:44.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETTER SYSTEM OF EDUCATION FOR

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:47.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS MUCH EXPERTS AS THEY ARE ON

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:50.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FUNCTIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THOSE ARE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:53.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'RE NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:54.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNITARIANS THAT COULD HAVE SOME

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BY DO YOU. FAVOR.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A UNITARY EXECUTIVE WHEN IT

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:58.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COMES TO ADMINISTRATIVE

01:13:59.001 --> 01:14:00.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EDUCATION FUNCTIONS WHEN ANOTHER

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:02.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AREAS BECAUSE WE BECAUSE THE

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:03.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CURRENT SYSTEM IS THE ONE THAT

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO ITSELF HAVE BEEN SUCH I HAVE

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEEN URGED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE RESTRUCTURED RIGHT WHAT

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT THE SUGGESTION I JUST MADE

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:12.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT YOU COULD FLIP. IT THE

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:12.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OTHER WAY AROUND SO THE

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ADMINISTRATIVE.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:15.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXIST IN THE STATE PARK I GOT A.

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COULD ARE YOU COULD OUR SENSE IS

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:16.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO DO IT

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:17.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
UNDER THE SLIDE.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:18.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
MY GOVERNOR

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT BECAUSE WE TAKE THAT

01:14:20.255 --> 01:14:21.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ULTIMATELY THE GOVERNOR IS THE

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:23.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PERSON WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AVERAGE CONSTITUENT WHO THE

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERSON WHO THE PUBLIC'S GOING TO

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOLD ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE THINK

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A MUCH

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STRONGER POSITION ELECTORALLY

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
QUITE FRANKLY GOVERNOR'S A

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BIGGER DEAL THAN S. B. I. AND WE

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK IT MAKES A LOGICAL SENSE

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
TO HAVE THE OVERALL

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACCOUNTABILITY IN ONE PLACE

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RATHER THAN ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DIFFERENT LOCUSTS AS. YOUR

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:43.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
POINT'S WELL TAKEN THAT YOU

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:44.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD SAY LET'S PUT IT ALL OVER

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HERE. BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK IT WOULD CONTINUE THE

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:49.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONFUSION ACT THAT WE CURRENTLY

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:50.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE THAT SORT OF. IT WITH WITH

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:53.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DUAL AND UNCLEAR LINES OF

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:55.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AUTHORITY BETWEEN SP AYE AND THE

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:56.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE BOARD WITH THE STATE BOARD

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:57.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF THE FEEDING ON OF THE

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOVERNOR. AN ARTS CENTER IS THIS

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:00.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS THE SIMPLEST MOST LOGICAL WAY

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO DO IT BUT THE TRUTH IS COMING

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALLING. THAT'S THE COMP THAT'S

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A CONVERSATION WE WANT YOU TO

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE AND YOU HAVE RECKONED

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LANDED ON THE REALLY SMART

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PEOPLE HERE WORK ON EDUCATION

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:12.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAY LONGER THAN I HAVE. AND SO

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE RISK AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A CLEARER MORE SIMPLE EFFICIENT

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEMS GOING TO BENEFIT GETS

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:20.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERIOD. BUT IT TO YOUR POINT'S

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WELL TAKEN YOU COULD DO IT DEATH

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THANK YOU AND I I I WILL JUST

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:27.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW THAT SORT OF THE ARGUMENT

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:28.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S MORE

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:31.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VISIBLE FIGURE THAT. IS EQUALLY

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AN ARGUMENT FOR PUTTING THE

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ATTORNEY GENERAL THIS AREA STATE

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO FORTH THOSE FUNCTIONS

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:39.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S WHILE I I

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:41.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULDN'T I I DOUBT I WOULD SAY

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:44.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT I DOUBT I WOULD AGREE WITH

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:48.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU BUT I GET YOUR POINT BUT I

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH SO I HAVE BEEN. LOOKING AT

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE LOCAL.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:53.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THINGS I WE HAVE ELECTED AND

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:54.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I THINK MOST COUNTY USER AT

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:55.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LEAST SEVERAL COUNTIES IN

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:56.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ELECTED COUNTY. AS

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:57.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION AND

01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:58.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE ALSO HAVE ELECTED I COUNTY

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:58.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOARDS OF EDUCATION DOES THAT

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
LEAD TO THE SAME SORT OF

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL EVEL YOU

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW IT'S. A GOOD QUESTION AND

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:02.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I'M NOT HERE DAY TO COME.

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:02.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IT'S A VERY GOOD.

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:03.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TO ASK

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:04.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M AND I THINK THAT MIGHT MY

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GENERAL SENSE ON THIS IS THAT

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE L. CFF DECISION TAKEN EARLY

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:07.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST TERM.

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:08.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
REALLY DEVOLVED A LOT OF

01:16:08.297 --> 01:16:08.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RESPONSIBILITYTO THE LOCAL

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEVEL FOR FUNDING IN AND OTHER.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OTHER LOCAL SCHOOLS DECISIONS

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS A MEAN

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ULTIMATELY I THINK OUR SENSE IS

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:15.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT I'LL SEE IF OPPOSITE GOOD

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DECISION THAT REALLY THAT THERE

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS A POSITIVE SUPPORT FOR THE

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:20.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATE PARTICULARLY FOR. AND IT

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR LOWER INCOME KIDS QUITE

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:24.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HONESTLY AND FOR DISTRICTS THAT

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:26.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
NEED THE MOST HELP UPON BUT

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:28.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S THIS IS A

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:29.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT'S RIGHT IT

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS A LONGER DISCUSSION IT'S NOT

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:33.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT. THERE AND BY THE WAY I

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WOULD SAY THIS TO.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:35.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS THE

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MAGIC BULLET WE'RE NOT SAYING

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE IS ONE THING IN OF ALL ALL

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:39.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
YOU HAVE TO DO HERE IS

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:41.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RESTRUCTURE THE SYSTEM AND.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:42.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE PERFECT IN

01:16:42.798 --> 01:16:44.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CALIFORNIA'S GOING GO FROM FORTY

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TWO TO ONE IN TWO YEARS.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S NO MAGIC BULLET THE WE

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:51.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
INTELLIGENT WAY TO MORE

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EFFICIENTLY DELIVER SERVICES TO

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:55.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIDS IN SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND TO HAVE A CLEAR LINE A CLEAR

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:58.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
LINE OF A THOUGHT OF

01:16:59.047 --> 01:16:59.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ACCOUNTABILITY TO YOUR

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONSTITUENTS AND THE GENERAL

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:03.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN

01:17:03.418 --> 01:17:04.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE SYSTEM OVERALL WHICH IS WHY.

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:05.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOU GUYS ARE ALL ON THE

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND PLOTS

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT MY LIFE WORKING ON KIDS AN

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION. RIGHT BUT I GUESS MY

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTION IS WHY ARE YOU FOCUSING

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:12.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON THIS REFORM AT THE STATE

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEVEL WHERE THE SAME BIFURCATION

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF AUTHORITY SEEMS TO EXIST AT

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:16.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE AFTER TALKING AFTER

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVING WORKED ON THESE ISSUES

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:21.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS. AND

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TALKING TO PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STATE AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:25.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY KEPT COMING BACK TO THE

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:26.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEME THAT PICTURE THAT WE

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SHOULD RESTRUCTURE THAT AND THAT

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:29.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EVERY COMMISSION THAT EVER

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:30.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOKED AT THAT SAYS RESTRUCTURE

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO AGAIN IT IS NOT A PURELY

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIGNED I THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT OF

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME WOMEN O'DONNELL QUESTIONS

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT YOU KNOW SHOW THEIR. PURE

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:39.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVIDENCE AGREED THE GOOD PHD

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THESIS PER SOME KID IT AT HIM

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IN A PHD UPS AT SCHOOL RIGHT

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:47.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOW. BUT IT'S JUST IT IT JUST ON

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ITS FACE AND AND ALSO WITH WITH

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:53.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE INPUT OF SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:54.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PEOPLE ON THE STATE.

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:55.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT IS A LOGIC A MORE LOGICAL

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:56.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
STREAMLINED EFFICIENT

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSPARENT SYSTEM. BUT IT'S NOT

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A MAGIC BULLET LEFT I WILL BE

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLEAR ON THAT THEY'RE STILL LOT

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF OTHER STUFF THAT YOU ALL. ON

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IMPORTANT COMMITTEE AFTER

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:05.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WORK ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION SO SO

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:07.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE THIS TO BE

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:08.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A MORE LOGICAL AND TRANSPARENT

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:09.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM EVERY NIGHT

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU THROW OUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:12.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATES THAT HAPPENED OF GOOD

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESULTS THAT ALSO. HAPPEN OF THE

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEM THAT YOU LIKE BUT THAT

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:17.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AYE GENTLEMAN TO TESTIFY BEFORE

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU GO I THINK YOU'LL KNOWLEDGE

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:19.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TOPIC

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:21.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU. I STATED THAT THERE IS

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:22.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NO QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTUALLY THE ONE SYSTEM WORKS

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BETTER HAN THE OTHER GOES BELOW

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ME FINISH MY QUESTION. AS TO WHY

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:27.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ARE WE SORT OF.

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:29.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THROWING AROUND IDEAS ABOUT

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:30.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT WE CAN TWEAK THIS BETWEEN

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BAT WITHOUT HAVING FIRST

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:33.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGOROUSLY STUDIED I YOU KNOW

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HUNDRED PLUS YEARS OF HISTORY

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:35.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WITH.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE DIFFER MODELS I THINK WE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE I MEAN I MY MY ANSWER TO IS

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK YOU HAVE I THINK THAT

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY ARE NOT GEARED TO TO THAT

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTION AND. AND AND THE TRUTH

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:44.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BEEN A MOUNTAIN OF RESEARCH

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MONEY PUT INTO STUFF LIKE THAT

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOO AND A DETAILED. QUANTIFIABLE

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:52.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISCUSSION ABOUT BUT I THINK IN

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:53.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THE BIG PICTURE SENSE

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I BET THAT IF YOU GO TAKE THAT

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:57.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GO GHOST SPEND AND AND I KNOW

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU AND YOUR ALL YOUR CABLE DO

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:00.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT FROM TIME TO. GO ASK ALL

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE PEOPLE IN EDUCATION THE

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATE TO WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT THIS AND

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:04.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'RE GOING TO GET DIFFERENCE

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OPINION FROM THE PEOPLE ARE

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:06.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GONNA TESTIFY AFTER MIDNIGHT A

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIGHT RIGHT. SO WE'RE NOT SICK

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND PART OF WHAT WE'VE WHAT I

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK IS REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:12.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISCUSSION IS YOU ARE BOTH.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOTH HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE HERE

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE TRYING TO

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:18.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
GET IT RIGHT. AND.

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:20.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALL OF THE INPUT WE HAVE GOTTEN

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:21.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WHILE THIS

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:23.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS A WONKY SOLUTION IT ACTUALLY

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:25.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WILL ULTIMATELY. IN YOUR TO

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR SCHOOLS

01:19:28.063 --> 01:19:29.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
HERE AND KICK DELIVERY OF

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:31.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SERVICES TO GET AND ALSO SENT TO

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE PUBLIC THERE'S

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCOUNTABILITY YEAH BUT IS VERY

01:19:33.735 --> 01:19:35.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE STUDY THAT. THAT COULD

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CANONIZE THAT NO AND THAT'S A

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:40.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FAIR QUESTION BUT THE BALANCE OF

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS SO AND THAT'S

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:42.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHY I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT CAN. COUPON SAID WHICH IS

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EVERY STUDY THAT'S LOOKED TO

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PASS FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS RECOMMENDED A CHANGE OF THIS

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NATURE WITHOUT ALL THE SPECIFIC

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ELEMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RELYING ON AND IT'S NOT PURE

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SCIENCE I WOULD AGREE.

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:57.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RIGHT WE I MEAN YOU I KNOW

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOMEONE WHO CARES VERY MUCH

01:19:58.160 --> 01:19:59.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT STUDENT TIME HOW COMES AND

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT. AND IMPROVING THAT AND I

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:02.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU SEEM TO BE ACKNOWLEDGING I

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:03.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GUESS THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKED AT WHAT'S WRITTEN OTHER

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STATES IN AS QUANTIFIABLE WAYS

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE COULD AND. AGAIN THAT THE

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:10.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
JOHN JUST TESTIFIED.

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:13.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AGREED WITH THAT SO WOULD YOU.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT MAKE ANY SORT OF STRUCTURAL

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGE UNTIL WE HAVE A HIGHER

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WHERE THAT THE

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOLKS WHO JUST TESTIFIED COULD

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TELL US THAT WE ACTUALLY DO NOW

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:24.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAVE SOME GOOD EVIDENCE.

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:25.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS MOTTO TO NOW IT WOULDN'T I

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:26.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULDN'T OF I THINK THAT'S A

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FAIR QUESTION NO I THINK THAT.

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:29.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I THINK THAT THE BODY OF

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS. IS IS GOOD

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENOUGH TO SUGGEST THAT A CHANGE

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOW WILL WILL MAKE THAT HAVE

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:36.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOUR MONEY WHAT THAT EVIDENCE

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:38.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS DONE I I THINK IT'S THAT

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.902 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
IT'S IT'S REALLY THE EVIDENCE
AS.

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF OF OF TO GAWKING TO ALL THE

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHER KEY EDUCATION PLAYERS

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AROUND THE CITY TALKING TO

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE ISN'T REALLY EVIDENCE YOU

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:48.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HAVE KEY POINT WHAT THE

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:49.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EVIDENCES.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW I WOULD AGAIN BE IT

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:50.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONLY EVIDENCE I WOULD POINT TO

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD BE THE STATES THAT ARE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXCEEDING US IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

EFFICIENT SYSTEMS COSTS OF THEIR

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

HOMEGROWN KNOWN LET MISTER STARR

PROPOSAL YEAH WE DID SAY WE HAD

OURSELVES.

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU SEE

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS WHERE YOU SEE THIS IS A BIG

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:03.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PICTURE QUESTION AS THE GREATEST

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:04.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DYSFUNCTION ASSOCIATE WITH OUR

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:06.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CURRENT STRUCTURE?

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:07.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT WHAT'S WITH THE BIGGEST

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE HERE?

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I WOULD SAY THAT THREE WERE AYE

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:13.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
JAY ACCOUNTABLE I THINK I KEEP

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:14.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
USING THE WORD ACCOUNTABILITY

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S NOT CLEAR

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO THE AVERAGE PERSON MAYBE TO

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
EXPERTS ON IT WHERE THE

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:21.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACCOUNTABILITY LIES WHICH WE

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:22.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:23.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
I THINK.

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND AND BY THE WAY THAT MATTERS

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:27.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN TERMS OF CONSTITUENTS

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BELIEVING THEY HAVE AN

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPPORTUNITY. TO. HELP THEIR KIDS

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET A BETTER EDUCATION IN THEIR

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOCAL SCHOOL BE BETTER AND WHICH

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:33.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE WAY THAT THE NINETY

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENT OF THE FOLKS WHO ELECT

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU THINK. THEY JUST WANT TO

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW REMOTE

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:40.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WORKS

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:41.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BETTER IMAGES MORE EFFICIENT

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:43.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DELIVERY OF RESOURCE. SO I WOULD

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT.

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IT'S AND IT'S STILL ITS THE

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:49.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EXPECT THE ALSO THAT TO EDIT

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SYSTEM WHERE THEY ALL POINT

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FINGERS AT THE. RIGHT NOW WHERE

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:52.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I KNOW THAT'S NT OUR FAULT

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:54.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S THEIR FAULT THAT THEIR

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESPONSE GOING. AND I THINK THAT

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S A CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
STRUCTURE WE BELIEVE THAT A

BEHIND THE POWER STRUCTURE

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. AYE

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS IN THE MIX WITH THE WAY THE

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:29.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOCAL GOVERNANCE IS TAKING PLACE

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:31.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLAYING THERE'S A FEAR PERHAPS

POSITION THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:37.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POLITICAL POWER TO THE

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:38.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNOR'S POSITION THE SAME

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TIME THE GOVERNOR'S WORKING ON

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TWENTY NINE DIFFERENT ISSUES.

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

WHATEVER THAT PARTICULAR

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:03.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOVERNOR MIGHT BE DIVERTED

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEY'RE DIVERTING THEIR

ATTENTION DO YOU HAVE A STRONG

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:11.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ELECTED OFFICIAL TO POKE TO

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:14.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%

WHICH WAS YOUR EARLIER QUESTION

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE

STATE LEVEL SO I ACTUALLY THINK

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THIS THEIR DESTRUCTION

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:45.286 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
WOULD ROUGH THAT WEEK THAT THE
PEOPLE

YOU KNOW EDUCATION COURSE HAS A

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:03.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHOLE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

GOVERNANCE COMPONENT TO THIS

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:06.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT DOESN'T.

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:09.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

THE SECRETARY STATE.

I'M.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE EDUCATION

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:24.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUCH A BIGGER PART OF THE BUDGET

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:25.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
CRACK.

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:26.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT ALIGNED IS FOR THAT REASON

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.830 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
ALONE TO TO GET THE GOVERNOR
AND.

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:32.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A GREATER SENSE OF BRIAN. BUT IT

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:35.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS A BIG QUESTIONS I IDEA AND I

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:38.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I MIGHT THE PART WHY ONE HAVE

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:41.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEARINGS FOR US THAT CAN SIT

BACK AND AND NOW SOME OF THESE

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:45.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
QUESTIONS AND.

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:46.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT BUT I THINK YOU TO SOME

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:47.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXTENT THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:48.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
IT IS ON.

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU TO TO YOU THE PROPONENTS OF

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:50.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF MAKING SUCH A BIG CHANGE IT

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:51.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BECAUSE.

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:52.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
YOU KNOW.

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:56.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SURE WE MAY IF THE CHOICE WERE

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT WE WERE STARTING A NEW

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:58.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BRAND NEW STATE.

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW WOULD WE STRUCTURE

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINGS THE WAY WE WE DO NOW YOU

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:02.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW PERHAPS NOT MAYBE MORE LAWS

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:02.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHICH IS OBSESSING BUT THE

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
QUESTION IS.

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:04.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IF WE'RE GOING TO.

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAKE ALL THE STEPS NECESSARY ALL

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:08.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE A A UPHEAVAL ASSOCIATED AYE

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IS GOING TO BE WORTH IT.

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'M NOT AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GREAT I ACTUALLY THINK.

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:13.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S CANDIDLY A REALLY WELL OF

01:35:13.908 --> 01:35:14.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GROW A GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT I

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD ASSUME THAT HOW WE WOULD

01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:17.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT IT. WE

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT IS WORTH

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:20.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IT YEAH BUT HAVING SAID IF

01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:21.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU'RE RIGHT AND I ALSO THINK

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S FAIR FOR YOU TO SAY. THAT

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:25.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE SHOULD SUBMIT MORE EVIDENCE

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO YOU AND I'M A AND WE WILL OF

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:28.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF WHY WE BELIEVE THIS WILL

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:30.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DELIVER AND AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE CAN FIND THAT EXISTS WHICH.

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:33.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:34.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS NOT GOING

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:35.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE PERFECT IF NOT GOING TO BE

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:37.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE UNIQUE WE TAILORED

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT YOU MIGHT

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IDEALLY LIKE OUT. BUT I AGREE

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:45.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THERE IS A BURDEN ON US TO

01:35:45.139 --> 01:35:46.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AFFIRM BILLY SHOW THAT WHY THAT

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:49.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WILL HAPPEN WE WILL BE HAPPY TO

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:52.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACCEPT THAT. I'M IN THE US AND

01:35:52.847 --> 01:35:55.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I ALSO THINK THIS INCREDIBLY

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPORTANT STRUCTURE AND THAT

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S WHY GO BACK TO THE TIMING

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS EITHER GOING TO HAPPEN

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:04.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS YEAR OR IT'S NOT. THIS IS

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:07.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE RIGHT YEAR THAT THE OTHER

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THING I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GONNA HAPPEN IT IN IN TWENTY

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY IT'S

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:17.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GONNA HAPPEN IN A YEAR WHERE.

THE GOVERNOR IS TURNING OUT THE

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:25.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPI IS TURNING OUT AND AND AND

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:27.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THEY DON'T HAVE SKIN IN THE

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GAME IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY OR

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PORTANTO ISSUES AND CONCERNS I'M

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.730 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
I JUST TO TRY TO BUILD UPON
YOUR.

01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:50.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHEN YOUR LAST QUESTIONS.

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:52.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE SENATOR ALAN TO OF THE

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:53.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITNESS WAS WHAT IS WHAT IS THE

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BIG ISSUE HERE WHAT'S THE MOST

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:57.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:00.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SOMEONE WHO SERVED.

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:02.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR TWENTY

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEARS BUT ALSO AS A CLASSROOM

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:06.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TEACHER NOT FOR QUITE AS LONG AS

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:08.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HER. SUBLIMINAL DONALD BUT FOR A

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:10.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUMBER OF YEARS AS A HIGHSCHOOL

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TEACHER AND ALSO AS A

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:12.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
RETURN OF EDUCATE.

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:14.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION IS IN A

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT BROUGHT ME TO A LEGISLATURE

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MORE THAN THING ELSE IT'S WHAT

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'M I DEEPLY CARE ABOUT.

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THE ISSUE I THINK THAT'S

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:23.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MOST IMPORTANT HERE IS THE

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:24.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION YOU HAVE

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO ELECTED OFFICIALS. MAY

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:33.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS.

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:35.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU HAVE

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
IS THAT WHEN THOSE.

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:38.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INDIVIDUALS.

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:41.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE NOT IN ALIGNMENT THERE'S

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:43.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DISAGREEMENT WHETHER IT'S A

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:44.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PARTISAN DISAGREEMENT AND

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IDEOLOGICAL DISAGREEMENT A

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PERSONALITY DISAGREEMENT.

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:51.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
IT'S AN ISSUE.

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:53.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE GOVERNOR HAS ALMOST ALL OF

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POWER THE GOVERNOR HAS THE

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
POWER OF THE PURSE.

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER OF

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:04.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
VETO. OF THE GOVERNOR HAS THE

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:06.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POLICY OF APPOINTMENT.

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:07.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF HIM THROUGH HIS STATE BOARD

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:09.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF EDUCATION AND THE WAY THE

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATUTE HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INTERPRETED BY THE COURTS.

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:15.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE POLICY FOR EDUCATION REST

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION BUT WITH THE

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOB IT SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:24.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BATTLES BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND

01:39:24.425 --> 01:39:26.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THERE

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:27.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAPPENED BATTLES IN THE PAST.

01:39:27.728 --> 01:39:30.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OF CURRENTLY WE HAVE.

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW. A QUITE FUNCTIONAL

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PEACEFUL RELATIONSHIP I THINK

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:35.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR

01:39:35.469 --> 01:39:36.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THE STATE POURED.

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:39.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:41.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION BUT THAT

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:43.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE AND

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:44.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT JUST BE

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:44.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
INSTRUCTED.

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:45.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OF FROM

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:47.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PERRANCE.

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:49.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MISTER TO SHARE WITH YOU YOU

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:50.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
KNOW WHAT. SOME OF THOSE

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:52.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONFLICTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.

01:39:52.853 --> 01:39:54.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
BECAUSE WE'D.

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:55.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY'RE LIKELY TO REEMERGE IN

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:56.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE FUTURE YOU KNOW AT SOME

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT IN HIGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:00.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ANSWER IS BUT THE LET JUST

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MADE NO MENTION TWO OR THREE OF

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:03.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THESE ONE IS. FIX UP THE

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:04.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONFLICT IN SOME RESPECTS HAVE

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:06.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPARKED SO MANY OF THE PREVIOUS

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STUDIES THAT HAVE CALLED FOR

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:09.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CHANGES.

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DEREK YOU KNOW THEM BUT I THINK

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT'S REALLY NOTEWORTHY EVEN

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:12.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THOUGH THESE ARE NUTS

01:40:12.806 --> 01:40:14.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH STUDIES IT

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY IS REMARKABLE THAT OVER

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE.

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:19.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
AS WELL AS.

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:20.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ALL OF THESE BLUE RIBBON

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMISSIONS HAVE COME TO THE

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:22.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SAME.

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:25.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE OUGHT TO BE MORE POWER

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:27.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S GIVEN TO THE GOVERNOR AND

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:28.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIST TO THE SUPERINTENDENT IN

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:30.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
PART BECAUSE.

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT'S THE DE FACTO OF

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:34.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT EXISTS

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:36.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE OUGHT TO BE MORE. BUT I

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:37.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THINK FORTHCOMING AND.

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:38.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN ESTABLISH AND AND I THINK IT

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALSO ONE OTHER POINT SENATOR PAN

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:43.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MADE REFERENCE TO THIS.

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:44.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ITEM THE ISSUE OF I THINK

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:46.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONFUSION IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I

01:40:46.673 --> 01:40:48.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THE ELECTORATE OFTENTIMES

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND EDUCATORS AS WELL WHO HAVE

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:51.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AT THE AT

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:53.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:54.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BELIEVE IT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:56.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IT IS A YOU

01:40:56.517 --> 01:40:57.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW A VERY POWERFUL PERSON.

01:40:58.051 --> 01:41:00.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT THEY HAVE FISCAL.

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:02.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAVE POLICY

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAKING AUTHORITY WHEN. IN FACT

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT MUCH IN

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT CAN BE MISLEADING I THINK

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:09.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO A TO EDUCATORS. BLOW ME GET

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:11.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BACK TO JUST UP.

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THIS ISSUE ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:13.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONFLICTS THAT EXISTED IN THE

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:15.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PAST AND I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT PLEASE JUST PASSING REFERENCE

01:41:17.971 --> 01:41:19.540 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
TO THE ISSUE OF HIGHER
EDUCATION.

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND GOVERNANCE AS RELEASED THE

01:41:22.042 --> 01:41:22.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:23.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CONSTRUCTION.

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:24.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SO AS IT RELATES TO.

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:26.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PARTISAN NATURE I JUST PUT

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
POINT OUT THAT OBVIOUSLY THE

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:29.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:30.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONSTRUCTION IS A NONPARTISAN

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OFFICE.

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT IN FACT FOR THE TIME THAT I

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:34.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEARCH THE LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
A SITUATION WHERE.

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE GOVERNOR'S TENDED TO BE

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
REPUBLICAN.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A REAGAN RIGHT BEFORE I GOT

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:42.996 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
ELECTED THE LEGISLATURE AND

SCHWARZENEGGER ARM AND THE

PARTISAN DIFFERENCE WITH HER IN

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:12.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PAST AT LEAST REPUBLICAN

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:14.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

INSTRUCTION.

01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:18.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THERE THERE WERE ISSUES.

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:20.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:20.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%

MENTION A NUMBER BUT THE ONE

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:25.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT COMES WITH THEM MOST

01:42:26.039 --> 01:42:26.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PRODUCTS MIND IS A AND A

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:27.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOVERNOR WHO FELT THAT THE

SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

INSTRUCTION WAS LIKELY GOING TO

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BE UPON. ARRIVAL LEAST THAT WAS

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:33.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE RUMOR FELT THAT THAT WAS

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO BE A SUPERINTENDENT OF

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:37.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WAS GOING TO

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
RUN AGAINST GOVERNOR.

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND IT'S RESULT OF THE HAD BEEN

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VIEWED AS A POTENTIAL RIVAL AN

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:42.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OPPONENT.

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INTO ACTIONS WERE TAKEN BY THE

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:47.127 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF BUDGET
TING.

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:48.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VETOES AND WHAT NOT THAT.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WERE CONTRARY TO THE INTERESTS

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:52.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
CONSTRUCTION AND I.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FELT IN THAT SITUATION THAT

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:55.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE IN

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT SITUATION WHERE KICKOFF

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:59.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EDUCATION I THINK AND SUFFER IF

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:02.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE GOVERNOR. HAS IT OUT FOR THE

01:43:02.142 --> 01:43:02.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:03.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
INSTRUCTION.

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE OTHER ISSUE THAT BOB.

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:08.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETIMES COMES UP AND IT IS THE

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISSUE OF I THINK PERSONALITIES

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT POLITICS

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF YOU HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:15.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT HAS A STRONG PERSONALITY

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:16.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT HAS SOME

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:19.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT SAY A BRASH PERSONALITY.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SAYS ON OCCASION THINGS

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:24.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THE GOVERNOR. A DOZEN

01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:25.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
APPRECIATE.

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT GOVERNOR ABUSES

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:29.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
INTEMPERATE NOT FAIR

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INAPPROPRIATE. UP THAT'S ANOTHER

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMPLE WHERE THE THE GOVERNOR

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:33.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
CAN.

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:35.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK TAKE ACTION AGAINST TO

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE SUPERINTENDENT AND

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ULTIMATELY TOWARDS. K. TWELVE

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EDUCATION THAT I THINK IS SO YOU

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW IS SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATE.

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:45.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF REFERENCE WAS MADE TO.

01:43:45.118 --> 01:43:47.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THE DEMARCO POSITION.

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:49.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WHICH

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WAS CREATED.

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:51.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
BY GOVERNOR WILSON.

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:54.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IN NINETEEN NINETY AND

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:56.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAINTAINED BY GOVERNOR DAVIS AND

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND AS

01:43:58.298 --> 01:43:59.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
WAS MENTIONED.

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:00.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAS BEEN ELIMINATED BY GOVERNOR

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:01.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
BROWN.

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:04.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ON THAT THE MINUS SIDE OF

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:05.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVING SUCH AN OFFICES WAS MADE

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:07.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REFERENCE IT TO SORT OF

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASES THE NUMBER OF POINTS

01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:09.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OF.

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:11.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF VOTE THE AUTHORITY THAT CAN

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:12.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BE CONFUSING TO PEOPLE.

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:14.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF THAT IS

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IT DOES HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GOVERNOR IF THEY HAVE THE

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:19.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOVERNOR WHO

01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:20.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS WORKING ON A DAILY BASIS WITH

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:21.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THE GOVERNOR ON K. TWELVE

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
EDUCATION.

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:24.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND MOVES AWAY FROM THIS

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:26.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SITUATION CENTER PAN MADE

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REFERENCE TO EARLIER THAT I

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THINK IS.

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:30.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT SO MUCH RECENTLY BUT IF YOU

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:30.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
GO BACK.

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:33.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A COUPLE OF DECADES AS I DO

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHERE THERE REALLY WAS A FEELING

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON THE PART I THINK OF SOME

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:37.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
GOVERNOR'S I WOULD SAY.

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:39.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF NOT CONSCIOUSLY UNCONSCIOUSLY

01:44:39.139 --> 01:44:41.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT EDUCATION ISN'T MY DOMAIN.

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:42.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT'S WE HAVE ELECTED

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:44.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER AND SO

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:45.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE GOVERNOR DID NOT PAY

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTICULAR CLOSE ATTENTION OR AS

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:49.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MUCH ATTENTION AS THEY MIGHT IF

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:50.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THEY HAD SOMEONE IN THEIR

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:52.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CABINET. IN THE HORSESHOE THAT

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:53.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WAS ACTUALLY WORKING ON K.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TWELVE I'M ISSUES.

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:56.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BOB BUT WHEN I WAS SERVING AS

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:58.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION THE

01:44:58.792 --> 01:44:59.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
GOVERNOR.

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:01.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RATHER THAN USING THE OFFICE

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENTIRELY AS HE POLICY MAKING

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OFFICE WHICH WAS WHAT IT WAS SET

01:45:05.198 --> 01:45:06.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
UP TO DO. UP BECAUSE THE

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:08.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:10.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:12.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INSTRUCTION. DEEP TO THE OFFICE

01:45:12.572 --> 01:45:13.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:15.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SOME ADMINISTRATIVE

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RESPONSIBILITIES TO CARRY OUT

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:19.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNOR WERE

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:19.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEAR AND DEAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:21.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEART. SO YOU HAVE THESE ISSUES

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PARTISANSHIP OF PERSONALITY

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:24.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENCE OF LACK OF CONFIDENCE

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:25.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
IN THE.

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:27.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THE OFFICE OF THE

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:28.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

INSTRUCTION ON OCCASION. AND

01:45:30.357 --> 01:45:31.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOSE THINGS REALLY GET IN THE

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:34.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAY I THINK ON OCCASION OF ARM.

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:35.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
NOT ONLY GOOD WORKING

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
RELATIONSHIP BUT.

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK TO THE DETRIMENT OF K.

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TWELVE EDUCATION BECAUSE I

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MENTIONED EARLIER THE POWER

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:43.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY RESTS WITH THE GOVERNOR

AUTHORITY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

GOVERNANCE IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WORTHY OF THE COMMITTEE'S

ARE DOWN FIFTY PERCENT. ONE OF

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:43.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT THE

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS IS

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GETTING THE WORD OUT TO HIGH

FOR THIS TO NAY COMMISSION IN

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%

DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME AT

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:57.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE SIZE THE WORK WE HAD TO DO

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:00.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT AT THAT. AT THE DEPARTMENT

01:51:01.988 --> 01:51:03.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CLOSING

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:04.357 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT WE TRIED

TO LEASE SAYS STATEWIDE

01:51:05.959 --> 01:51:07.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
CONVERSATIONS.

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:08.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE WERE THE PROGENITORS IN

01:51:08.261 --> 01:51:09.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THE SPONSORS OF THE EARLIEST

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:10.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF THE GETTING ON THE FACTS

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:11.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
STUDIES WHICH I THINK.

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:12.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RESULTED IN MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:13.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BEEN DEALING WITH THE LAST

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:16.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND AFTER THAT I SPENT THREE

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEARS WITH THE BILL AND MELINDA

01:51:17.203 --> 01:51:18.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GATES FOUNDATION RUNNING THEIR

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLICY SHOP FOR EDUCATION IN THE

01:51:20.273 --> 01:51:21.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
UNITED STATES.

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:23.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A AND HAD EXPERIENCE FROM THAT

01:51:23.543 --> 01:51:25.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IN MANY DIFFERENT PLACES

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVERTURE SORT OF MANY YEARS AT

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:30.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS A

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONSULTANT TO AN ADVOCATE A

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
COACH AND A FACILITATOR

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:35.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONVERSATIONS MOST RECENTLY I.

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:36.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STILL ATTEND THE CONVERSATION

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:39.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE

01:51:39.559 --> 01:51:40.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE HAVING IN THE STATE OF

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:41.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
WASHINGTON.

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:42.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OBVIOUSLY MY COMMENTS ARE MY OWN

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:43.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I DON'T REPRESENT ANYBODY IN

01:51:43.696 --> 01:51:44.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THIS.

01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:45.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT THEY'RE BASED ON THESE

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:48.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COUPLE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE.

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DON'T TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE FROM

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:50.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A FROM A SAMPLE OF POLICY AND

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:53.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POLITICS.

01:51:53.073 --> 01:51:54.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO THESE ARE MY MAIN POINTS

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:55.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE THEY ARE AND I THINK WE'VE

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:56.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HEARD A LOT OF EVIDENCE HERE

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TODAY THE DISH WITH NO PERFECT

01:51:59.112 --> 01:52:01.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STRUCTURE TO ENSURE. EFFICIENCY

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:03.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I THINK EFFICIENCY IS PART

01:52:03.116 --> 01:52:03.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:05.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HERE.

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:07.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVEN IF THERE WERE I WOULD STILL

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSITED THAT AND I WOULD CHOOSE

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THERE BE A STRONG ELECTED

01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:12.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SPI AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THAT

01:52:12.859 --> 01:52:15.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
STRUCTURE.

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:16.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MY THIRD POINT IS THAT SOME OF

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:17.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ITS ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HISTORICAL AND PRACTICAL PERSON

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:21.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONSIDERATIONS PREVENT BIG

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:23.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
STRUCTURAL CHANGE.

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:24.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN THAT THE

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:26.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PREPONDERANCE OF STUDIES AND THE

01:52:26.439 --> 01:52:28.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LACK HUNDREDS OF ACTION HAS HURT

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:30.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
GIVEN IT TO THEM.

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:31.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I THINK ALSO MY WOULD LAST

01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:32.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT I WANT TO MAKE TO IS THAT

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:33.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK IT'S BEEN TOUCHED UPON

01:52:34.047 --> 01:52:35.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BOTH AND THAT SORT OF THE.

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:37.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:39.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CREE QUE AND EARLY LEARNING AND

01:52:39.352 --> 01:52:41.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE POST SECONDARY PARTLY

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:43.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
QUESTION THAT THAT. THE GROUP A

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:44.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GREAT CONVERSATION TO BE HAS A

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:46.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONVERSATION ABOUT LINKAGES OF

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:48.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE AND ENTER. OUR INTER

01:52:48.394 --> 01:52:49.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEGMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:50.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ACCOUNTABILITY NOTHING IS A

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:52.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GREAT CONVERSATION. PERHAPS THE

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:54.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT COMMITTEES CAN UNDERTAKE A

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
GOING FORWARD.

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:57.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I AM SO OBVIOUSLY A DOUBLE THE

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:59.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NUMBER OF OF ORGANIZATIONS THIS

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:00.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
IS MY FIRST POINT EVERY

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS FROM

01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:04.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WASHINGTON TO. LOUISIANA TO NEW

01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:06.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YORK TO MASSACHUSETTS THAT.

01:53:06.246 --> 01:53:07.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU'VE HAD OF THE PRESENTATION

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:09.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECESS AND THERE ARE SOME OF FOR

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:11.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BAIT GREAT MODELS.

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:12.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A FORGOTTEN GENERAL BUCKETS OF

01:53:12.352 --> 01:53:13.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOVERNANCE AND THEN TWELVE

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STATES HAVE DONE THEIR OWN THING

01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:17.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUTSIDE OF THOSE AND. AND IN YOU

01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW GET SINCE I THINK I HAVE WE

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:20.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SEEN THAT THERE IS ONE THAT

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:22.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
RISES TO THE TOP AND SO

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:24.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEMONSTRATES TO ME THAT THERE.

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:25.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALLY IS NO PERFECT STRUCTURE.

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:27.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TIME FOR OPERATING THIS

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:29.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENTERPRISE IF THERE IF THERE WAS

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOULD HAVE IF THERE WAS GOING TO

01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:31.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BE HAVING ROBUST CONVERSATION

01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT HOW TO ANY SORT OF FIX IT

01:53:33.907 --> 01:53:35.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
THAT WAY.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO MY FUNDAMENTAL CONCLUSION

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:38.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND SORT OF BEEN

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:39.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATIONS

01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:41.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN I WAS PLEDGE THAT FROM WHEN

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:42.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I WAS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT.

01:53:42.582 --> 01:53:43.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STRUCTURES REALLY THROUGH THE

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:46.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MATERIAL. UNLESS IT ISN'T AND

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:47.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR MANY OTHER REASONS THAT GARY

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:49.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ISLA OUTLINED.

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:53.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
M.. STRUCTURE IS A STRUCTURES

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:55.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BLAME IN SOME INSTANCES FOR

01:53:55.795 --> 01:53:56.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUES THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:56.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
TO

01:53:57.063 --> 01:53:57.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING.

01:53:57.697 --> 01:53:59.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POLITICAL PERSONAL PHILOSOPHICAL

01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:00.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISAGREEMENTS ARE POSSIBLE AND

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBABLE IN ANY STRUCTURE THE

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:03.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE WHETHER IT'S ELECTED OR

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:05.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPOINTED OFFICIALS INEFFICIENCY

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:06.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IS POSSIBLE AND.

01:54:06.906 --> 01:54:08.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULAR NOT UNDER ANY STRUCTURE

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:09.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT YOU HAVE IS THE NATURE IN

01:54:09.909 --> 01:54:10.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE FORM OF OUR GOVERNMENT

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESPECIALLY HISTORY LEADERSHIP.

01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:14.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
MY SECOND POINT IS THAT

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:16.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ULTIMATELY I SUPPORT THE NOTION.

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:17.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT ISN'T TRYING TO OUR

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:18.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONSTITUTION THAT THERE IT THAT

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY'RE BEING ELECTED PERSON

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:21.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHOSE SOLE JOB IT IS.

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:24.190 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
TO PAY ATTENTION TO OUR
STUDENTS.

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:25.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONE PERSON THE GUARDIAN OF THE

01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:28.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROMOTER THE PROTECTOR THE NIGER

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SUPERINTENDENT IF YOU WILL.

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:31.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE NEEDS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:33.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF THE STATE WHO REPRESENT OUR

01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:34.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FUTURE IF YOU ARE ECONOMIC

01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:35.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUCCESS IN OUR SOCIAL SUCCESS IN

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:38.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FUTURE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MY SENSE IS THAT IT EDUCATION'S

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:41.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A GOBLET EXERCISE WHAT IS MY

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:44.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SENSE MY EXPERIENCE IS EDUCATION

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:45.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS A COMPLICATED A TENER PRAWNS.

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:47.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LET DESERVES NO LESS LEADERSHIP

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:48.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SINGLE MINDED FOCUS THAN

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DOES JUSTICE WHO'S MORE

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMPLICATED WE THOUGHT HAVE.

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:53.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAS CERTAINLY WHEN WE GOT THERE.

01:54:53.353 --> 01:54:55.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'M.

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YEAH WHO SINGLE MINDED FOCUS IS

01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:59.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
IMPORTANT.

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AS JUSTICE TREASURY.

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:04.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
OR EVEN INSURANCE.

01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:05.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO TO THE HISTORICAL ON

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:06.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT. WE'RE IN

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT AND EXTENDED PERIOD IS NO

01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:08.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
QUESTION ABOUT IT OF GOOD

01:55:09.035 --> 01:55:10.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:11.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNOR'S A STATE BOARD OF

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:13.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
EDUCATION ELECTIVES

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:14.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPERINTENDENT. AND ALONG WITH

01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:16.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU FUNDAMENTAL AND LASTING

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:18.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO THE

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:19.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
STRUCTURE OF EDUCATION IN

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:20.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
CALIFORNIA.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEAH AND IT HAS ALWAYS IT IN

01:55:21.948 --> 01:55:23.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOUSE HELD IN A VERY POSITIVE

01:55:23.416 --> 01:55:25.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:26.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE'S

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MOST PARTICULARLY WHAT'S

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HAPPENING THE PARALLEL.

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
PREVIOUSLY.

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNDERGOVERNOR DAVIS AT SET TO

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:34.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRETEND O'CONNELL WITH A SIMILAR

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:36.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

01:55:36.162 --> 01:55:37.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ESPECIALLY WHEN GARY WAS THE.

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:40.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:43.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PHILOSOPHY THAN WHAT WAS ALWAYS

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:44.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD GOVERNANCE DOESN'T MATTER

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:46.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS LONG AS THE PLAYERS IN EACH

01:55:46.105 --> 01:55:47.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GAME GAUGE WITH EACH OTHER

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
FORTHRIGHTLY.

01:55:48.908 --> 01:55:50.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FAIRLY AND HONORABLY IT WAS

01:55:50.643 --> 01:55:52.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:54.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABOUT TRANSPARENCY REQUIRED US

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:56.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE THAT TO HEAR THE NOTION

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:58.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THERE WERE THAT THERE BE NO

01:55:58.284 --> 01:55:59.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SURPRISES AND THOSE WERE OUR

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:00.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT WHEN WE

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:02.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENGAGE WITH THE STATE BOARD.

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WHEN HE WAS THE STATE

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPERINTENDENT AND I HAVE TO

01:56:05.658 --> 01:56:07.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TELL YOU IT WAS EASY AT TIMES

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:09.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SORELY TESTED AT OTHER TIMES

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:09.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BECAUSE.

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ULTIMATELY OF COURSE AS WE ALL

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:12.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW WE HAD A VERY BAD WORKING

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:13.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNOR

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:16.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:17.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES BUT NOT

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
BUT OFF MIKE.

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:20.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THE STORIES IS GARY RELATED

01:56:20.506 --> 01:56:20.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

01:56:20.973 --> 01:56:22.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FROM PREVIOUS SBI'S IN PREVIOUS

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:23.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GOVERNORS ARE ARE LEGENDARY

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:27.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
EQUALLY LEGEND.

01:56:27.313 --> 01:56:28.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT

01:56:28.548 --> 01:56:29.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEASE FROM POLITICAL PRACTICAL

01:56:29.849 --> 01:56:31.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
STANDPOINT FROM MY FROM MY

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:32.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STANDPOINT MOST OFTEN IN

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CALIFORNIA THE CONTEXT IS THE

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:36.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTEXT IN ITS TO THE CONUNDRUM

01:56:36.322 --> 01:56:37.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS CAST AS CONFLICT BETWEEN THE

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FBI AND THE GOVERNOR'S THROUGH

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:41.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HIS OR HER BOARD OF EDUCATION.

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:42.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PREMISE IS THAT TO FIX THE

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:44.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROBLEM ONE OF THE PLAYERS HAS

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:46.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY DISEMPOWERED

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:49.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND USUALLY THAT'S THE SPI.

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:49.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BUT OPPOSITE THEIR

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:50.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CONSTITUTIONAL.

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:52.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE REAL

01:56:52.305 --> 01:56:53.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGE TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:55.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
BUSINESS.

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:57.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MEANS THAT IT REQUIRES A AND A

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

01:56:59.812 --> 01:57:02.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'VE SEEN IT THAT VOTERS LIKE

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:02.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE THAT

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:03.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
REPRESENT THEM.

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:05.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT.

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:07.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL SOLUTION

01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:08.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
OCCUR IN THE FBI.

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:09.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST POINTED

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:11.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUT THAT THERE WERE THREE TIMES

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE PAST ALREADY AND THEY

01:57:12.158 --> 01:57:14.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WERE NOT SUCCESS.

01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:15.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TOOK ME TECH TO GIVEN THE STI

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:16.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THAT ARE THE QUESTION ON THE

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:18.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OTHER SIDE WHAT GOVERNOR WOULD

01:57:18.965 --> 01:57:20.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OPT TO GET RID OF THE STATE

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:21.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BOARD OF EDUCATION OR

CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.

01:57:32.779 --> 01:57:33.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO NO GOVERNOR'S GOING TO GIVE

01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:35.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THAT UP.

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:38.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL AND.

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:42.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU'VE HAD IT BOMBING TIMES HAVE

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:43.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HEARD PEOPLE COME BEFORE YOU

AND SAY YOU KNOW I LIKE HALF OF

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:49.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THAT BILL.

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN THIS INSTANCE I LOVE THE

01:57:50.797 --> 01:57:51.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONCEPT I COME FROM A REALLY

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:53.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
GOOD PLACE.

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:54.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I APPLAUD THE NOTION THAT

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:55.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMONSENSE READ THE TABLE ABOUT

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:56.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALL THE SEGMENTS BEING CONNECTED

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:59.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TO EACH OTHER.

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:00.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MY READ THEIR PROPOSAL HOWEVER

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:02.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS HASN'T LEADS ME TO BELIEVE

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:02.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT IT WON'T ADDRESS THE

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHALLENGES MIGHT OBFUSCATE SOME

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:04.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ALREADY

01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:07.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
HAVE.

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:08.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
I'M AND PERHAPS HAS

01:58:08.314 --> 01:58:10.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE OTHER POINT THAT I'D MENCKEN

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:13.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS ALREADY MADE IN THE IN THE

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:14.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
COMMITTEE TODAY.

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:15.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS THAT THERE ARE NON STATE

01:58:15.788 --> 01:58:17.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMPONENTS TO THIS EQUATION THAT

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:18.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE THAT HAVE RISEN IN IMPORTANT

01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:20.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ESPECIALLY. IN AN ERA OF

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:22.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUBSIDIARITY WHAT ABOUT THE

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:23.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS WHAT

01:58:23.463 --> 01:58:25.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ABOUT THE CTC.

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:26.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE C. C.

01:58:26.699 --> 01:58:28.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
E.?

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:29.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISTRICT LEADERSHIP DISTRICT

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
BOARDS.

01:58:31.337 --> 01:58:31.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND I THINK.

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:34.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BOTH THE TERMINAL DONALD SENATOR

01:58:36.175 --> 01:58:37.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PAN IN THE SETTLEMENT KILEY HAVE

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:39.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MENTIONED THAT THOSE FACTORS ARE

01:58:39.111 --> 01:58:41.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRETTY KEY ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ORDER OF BUSINESS WITHOUT HAPPEN

01:58:42.748 --> 01:58:44.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
LCF AT.

01:58:44.584 --> 01:58:45.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ANY

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:47.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONVERSATION ABOUT GOVERNANCE

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:48.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND OR STRUCTURE HAS TO ADDRESS

01:58:48.354 --> 01:58:50.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
ALL THOSE PARTS.

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:52.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF K. TWELVE AND THE END AND

01:58:52.625 --> 01:58:53.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SERVE HORIZONTALLY AND

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:54.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VERTICALLY WITH THE OTHER

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:56.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SEGMENTS INVOLVED.

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:57.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO MY LAST POINT IS THAT I'D

01:58:57.997 --> 01:58:59.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
POSIT WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER

01:58:59.265 --> 01:59:01.133 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
CONVERSATION NOT ABOUT
STRUCTURE.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT ABOUT FUNCTION ABOUT SORT OF

01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:04.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
JOINT AND SEVERAL ACCOUNTABILITY

01:59:04.437 --> 01:59:07.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF ONE SEGMENT TO THE OTHER.

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:09.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EARLY HEAD AND PRETTY EASY AND

01:59:09.575 --> 01:59:10.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEN CREE QUE LINKED TO K.

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TWELVE AND RESPONSIBLE TO EACH

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:13.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHER QUE TROUBLING TO POST

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:15.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SECONDARY ROOM AND IN SOME

01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:16.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MEASURE RESPONSIBLE TO EACH

01:59:16.148 --> 01:59:17.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OTHER. ALL SEGMENTS ANSWERABLE

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:18.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:20.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OBVIOUSLY OUR SOCIETY OUR

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:21.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ECONOMY AND OUR STUDENTS

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:23.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
PRIMARILY.

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:24.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT COULD BE A BILL IT IF THAT'S

01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:26.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT FEASIBLE IT COULD BE BUDGET

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:28.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTION VERY EASILY IF NOT IT

01:59:28.794 --> 01:59:30.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF WAYS BUT

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:32.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

APART YEARS A LITTLE BIT. AND

02:00:22.915 --> 02:00:25.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MISTER PAYNE GIVEN SOME OF THE

BASICALLY SAYING.

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:35.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POWERS ARE IN THE HANDS OF

02:00:54.747 --> 02:00:55.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE GOVERNOR HAS WITH YOU IN THE

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:56.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THEN.

02:07:51.964 --> 02:07:53.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TYPICALLY NOT VERY INTERESTED IN

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:54.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CREATING NEW GOVERNANCE

02:07:54.166 --> 02:07:54.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%

TO FLY CELIBATE.

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:06.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF THIS IS JUST KIND OF EVOLVED

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:07.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I THINK IT'S KIND OF AN INFORMAL

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY DIRECTIVE

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:10.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE

OF A. PARTICULARLY WITH THE

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:15.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
DEMISE OF SEPAK

AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:17.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
COORDINATING.

COUNCIL HAVING SOME MECHANISM BY

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:21.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WHICH.

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OF PEOPLE IN THE HIGHER

02:08:22.261 --> 02:08:24.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EDUCATION LEADERSHIP CAN

COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:27.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS WAS SORT OF ESTABLISHED AND

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:28.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I THINK APPROPRIATELY AS THE

02:08:28.834 --> 02:08:29.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC IS.

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:31.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
PART OF THE

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:33.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE K. TWELVE

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:34.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

YOU KNOW THIS GOVERNOR I THINK

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:43.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE DONE

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:45.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STATUTORILY TO TRY TO CREATE

02:08:45.617 --> 02:08:48.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUCH A. POEM YOU NOBODY PROBABLY

YOU KNOW PERHAPS NEXT YEAR

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:53.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THERE COULD BE A DIFFERENT

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
APPROACH. I DO THINK THAT YOU

02:08:55.894 --> 02:08:57.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COULD YOU COULD FUND THIS EASILY

02:08:57.930 --> 02:08:58.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BY ASKING EACH OF THE SEGMENTS

02:08:59.031 --> 02:09:00.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY WOULD PROBLY WOULDN'T

02:09:00.199 --> 02:09:01.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULDN'T LIKE THIS TO SAY THAT

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:03.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

COORDINATION ARTICULATION

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:13.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:15.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAY TO TO DO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE

KATE KATE PARTS APART YOU'RE

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:19.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PREPARED SUGGESTION THAT YOUR

02:11:19.404 --> 02:11:20.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPINION IS THAT WE OUGHT TO JUST

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GET RID OF THAT. BUT POLCY

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:24.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRETENDS POSITIONAL TOGETHER. IT

02:11:24.209 --> 02:11:26.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
IS THAT IT DO YOU DO I MAKE
THAT.

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:29.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE OR DO

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU HAVE THAT FEELING BECAUSE.

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:33.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ULTIMATELY YOU THINK THAT IT.

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:35.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS IS

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DECEPTIVE TO THE VOTERS THAT DID

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:38.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POWERS AND THE GOVERNOR WE

02:11:38.957 --> 02:11:41.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CREATE THIS POSITION THAT.

02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:42.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT IS VOTERS THE SENSE THAT

02:11:42.294 --> 02:11:43.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY'RE VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO'S

02:11:43.295 --> 02:11:45.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RUNNING THE SCHOOLS AND THAT'S

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:47.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
ULTIMATELY AND.

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:49.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECEPTIVE IN AND WE ARE JUST.

02:11:49.701 --> 02:11:51.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DO AWAY WITH IT FOR THAT REASON.

02:11:52.004 --> 02:11:53.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DECEPTIVE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:54.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE TWO STRONG WORD I DON'T

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:55.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:56.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REASON I THINK THAT'S A

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:57.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONTRIBUTING REASONS TO IT BUT I

02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:59.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY IS TO

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS.

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:02.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF

02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:03.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
GOVERNMENT TO HAVE MAJOR

YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD LEADS TO

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE PROBLEMS THAT WE DON'T

HAVE NOW BUT W'VE HAD A IN IN

02:12:15.994 --> 02:12:17.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PAST AND. AS I MENTIONED

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:18.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EARLIER I JUST THINK THE

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:21.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOVERNOR IS THE KEY PLAYER THE

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:22.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GOVERNOR NEEDS TO ASSUME.

02:13:29.201 --> 02:13:30.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ELIMINATING THE OFFICE IN MY

02:13:30.168 --> 02:13:33.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

BUT IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS.

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE.

02:13:47.619 --> 02:13:49.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

ONE HAND AND.

02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:38.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT IT IS

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNLIKELY THAT THE VOTERS WOULD

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:40.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WANT TO GET RID OF A ELECTED

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:41.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POSITION.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:15:43.602 --> 02:15:44.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW SO KEEP THE POSITION

02:15:44.903 --> 02:15:46.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GIVE IT MORE OF AN ADVOCACY ROLE

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:48.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN TERMS OF MEMBERS OF CITIES

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:49.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VERY SPORTS A COMMISSION SIMILAR

POWERS. BUT ULTIMATELY.

02:15:51.977 --> 02:15:53.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PUT AN APPOINTED.

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:57.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERSON I HAD IN CHARGE OF THE CD

02:15:57.249 --> 02:15:58.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHO IS SINGULARLY FOCUSED AND

02:15:58.717 --> 02:16:00.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NOT AS POLITICALLY ORIENTED.

02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:02.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO DO MAKE

02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:04.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE BEST OF THE OF THE POLITICAL

02:16:04.656 --> 02:16:06.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REALITIES IN THE STRUCTURES BUT

02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:08.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO THE. SORT OF IMPERATIVES

02:16:08.293 --> 02:16:10.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
YOU'RE DESCRIBING.

02:16:10.161 --> 02:16:11.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I IN THE WAY THAT HE'S CRAFTED

02:16:11.296 --> 02:16:13.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
THIS PROPOSAL.

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:15.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I I THINK THAT THAT MAY BE A

02:16:15.901 --> 02:16:16.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
STEP IN THE RIGHT.

02:16:16.801 --> 02:16:18.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU KNOW DIRECTION I MEAN ALL

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:20.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THESE MOST RECENT STUDIES

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE NOT GONE THE ROUTE OF

02:16:21.473 --> 02:16:22.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE OFFICE

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:23.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE I THINK THEY FEEL THAT

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:25.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT CAN'T BE ELIMINATED SO TO TRY

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO RESTRUCTURE THE OFFICE AND

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:28.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CAREFULLY DEFINED.

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:31.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WHAT IT IS AND A TWO MINUTE

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:32.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%

ROLE ARM OR EXPAND ITS ROLE IN

02:16:34.986 --> 02:16:37.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADVOCACY AS MISTER STARR WOULD

.

02:16:39.457 --> 02:16:40.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MAYBE THAT WILL WORK I WORRY A

02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:42.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITTLE BIT THAT AS LONG AS YOU

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:43.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S INDEPENDENTLY

CAN YOU BE A LITTLE BIT
PREGNANT.

02:26:08.359 --> 02:26:10.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CHANGED AT ALL BECAUSE WE

02:26:10.128 --> 02:26:10.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACTUALLY TOOK TIME WE CREATED A

02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:11.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
COVER.

02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:13.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
FORCE WITHIN ACSA

02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:14.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
I'M TO LOOK AT ALL THE

02:26:14.532 --> 02:26:15.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
RECOMMENDATIONS AND.

02:26:16.033 --> 02:26:17.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EITHER ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:19.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUGGESTED TO A COUPLE PEOPLE

02:26:19.370 --> 02:26:20.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RECENTLY IS THE LONGER YOU'RE ON

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:21.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS PLANET YOU REALIZE THERE

02:26:21.739 --> 02:26:23.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE NOT A WHOLE LOT OF NEW IDEAS

02:26:23.074 --> 02:26:24.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THEY JUST SORT OF KEEP.

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:25.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RESURFACING IN SOME SORT OF

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:26.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ITERATION

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:28.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AS WE THINK THIS IS.

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:30.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT FALLS INTO THAT CATEGORY.

02:26:30.481 --> 02:26:32.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I AM DO WE WHERE WE WERE AT THE

02:26:32.783 --> 02:26:34.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TIME AND WE STILL CONTINUE TO BE

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:35.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD

02:26:35.419 --> 02:26:37.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BE ELECTED S. P. I THAT THAT IS.

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:39.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

02:26:39.390 --> 02:26:41.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE PUBLIC. AND BUT LISTEN TO

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:42.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE TESTIMONY TODAY I WAS KIND

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:42.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
OF FUN.

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:44.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
WE'VE

02:26:44.662 --> 02:26:45.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOOKING AND THINKING ABOUT OTHER

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IDEAS AND ONE OF THE THOUGHTS I

02:26:47.532 --> 02:26:48.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HAD IS.

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:49.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND REALLY MOVING FORWARD IS

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:53.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTINUITY I'M WHERE WE HAD THE

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEAST ABOUT CONTINUITY IS WHEN

02:26:54.672 --> 02:26:55.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE THROUGH WENT DIFFERENT

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CHANGES WHEN WE HAD THE

02:26:56.807 --> 02:26:58.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. AND

02:26:58.376 --> 02:26:59.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SENATOR HART WAS AN AMAZING

02:26:59.777 --> 02:27:01.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SECRETARY AT THE TIME BOTTOM

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:02.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S WHERE MY MEMBERS BUT

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:04.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THROUGH HAD A LOT OF CONFUSION

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:05.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAD THIS THIRD

02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:07.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERSON THAT WAS KIND OF. IN AND

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT OF CREATING POLICY I THINK

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:11.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THE THIS FIELD FEELS THE

02:27:11.556 --> 02:27:13.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAY IT WORKS NOW IS FINE. AND I

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:14.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THINK THAT.

02:27:14.592 --> 02:27:15.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCOUNTABILITY TO BE HONEST THE

02:27:17.361 --> 02:27:18.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CAPABILITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:27:18.829 --> 02:27:20.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I'M IT IS A LONG WAY FROM A

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:22.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DISTRICT TO THE STATE TO WHETHER

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT'S THE STATE BOARD WEATHERS

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:26.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE LEGISLATURE. SO KEEPING THAT

02:27:26.571 --> 02:27:28.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IN IN MIND IS WHERE WE REALLY

02:27:28.439 --> 02:27:29.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
POINT OF VALUE THE THE

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:30.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT IS WITH

02:27:30.808 --> 02:27:33.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REACHING OUT TO. OUR LOCALS UP

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:35.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND I THINK HAVING A STATE

02:27:35.346 --> 02:27:37.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ELECTED S. P. AYE IS PROBABLY

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:38.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMETHING THAT WE WORRY ABOUT IT

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:40.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HERE A LOT MORE THAN I THINK THE

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:42.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE ON THE FIELD REALLY WORRY

02:27:42.286 --> 02:27:42.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ABOUT.

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:43.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WITHOUT THINKING.

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:44.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FROM WHICH ROOM.

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:45.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
I APPRECIATE THAT.

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:46.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEXT WE HEAR FROM TERRY BURNS

02:27:46.591 --> 02:27:47.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:49.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ASSOCIATION.

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:50.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT LARA'S RIGHT SOME OF US

02:27:50.962 --> 02:27:51.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:55.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AWHILE AND HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

02:27:55.166 --> 02:27:57.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DAYS BACK WHEN THE HOENIG

02:27:57.268 --> 02:27:58.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DECISION JUST CAME OUT.

02:27:58.336 --> 02:28:00.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:01.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE WERE ALL KIND OF IN A

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:03.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENT PLACE FIGURING OUT

02:28:03.407 --> 02:28:05.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WERE

02:28:05.276 --> 02:28:07.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND HOW THINGS CHANGED NOW.

02:28:07.612 --> 02:28:09.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I THINK THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY

02:28:09.447 --> 02:28:12.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WELL ESTABLISHED OVERTIME.

02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:14.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'RE WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE WE

02:28:14.318 --> 02:28:15.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GET HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.

ON MISTER PAYNE WAS RIGHT YOU

LEGISLATE RELATIONSHIPS ON

02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:22.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH FOLKS GET ALONG AND WORK

TOGETHER.

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:24.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

.

02:28:26.964 --> 02:28:30.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVEN IF WE HAVE. GOVERNOR NSP

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

HAVE A LEGISLATURE WHO IS.

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:38.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIMILARLY ALIGNMENT WE WILL

ALWAYS HAVE THOSE CONFLICTS.

02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:43.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE'RE JUST NOT FEELING THAT

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:45.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

02:30:25.015 --> 02:30:26.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THRILLED THE TREND FROM CHILDREN

02:30:26.117 --> 02:30:27.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOW.

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR

02:30:29.153 --> 02:30:30.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THAT

02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:33.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPECIFIC SCOPE OF THE ENTITIES.

02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:34.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER WE

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:38.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CONVERSATION. THAT SAID AND

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:39.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALONG THE LINES OF THE OF THE

02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:40.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY

02:30:40.931 --> 02:30:43.100 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
MEMBERS IN AND VARIOUS
PANELISTS.

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:44.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHILL NOW BELIEVES THE BEFORE WE

02:30:44.535 --> 02:30:45.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
START TALKING ABOUT STRUCTURES

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:47.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE

02:30:47.371 --> 02:30:49.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIRST IDENTIFYING CLARIFY WHAT

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:49.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE STATE'S FUNDAMENTAL

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:51.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMMITMENT IS GOING TO BE.

02:30:51.542 --> 02:30:54.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO KIDS AND FAMILIES AND THE

02:30:54.211 --> 02:30:54.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BROADER.

02:30:54.645 --> 02:30:56.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADULTS WHO PARTICIPATE EACH OF

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:57.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

02:30:57.982 --> 02:30:59.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS IT

02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:00.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
AND FUNDAMENTAL IN.

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT COMMITMENTS ARE WE GONNA

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAKE TO THOSE CHILDREN AND WHAT

02:31:04.221 --> 02:31:05.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS THE STATE'S ROLE AS THE

02:31:05.890 --> 02:31:07.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GUARANTOR OF THOSE COMMITMENTS?

02:31:07.558 --> 02:31:09.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UP ONCE WE HAVE CLARITY ON THAT

02:31:09.126 --> 02:31:10.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FRONT AND THEN HOW THE DIFFERENT

02:31:10.895 --> 02:31:11.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STRUCTURES MIGHT BEST BE

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:13.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ORGANIZED CAN FLOW FROM THAT.

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:19.136 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
UNFORTUNATELY WITHIN AND THAT'S
ESPECIALLY

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:20.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PROBLEMATIC FROM EQUITY

02:31:20.871 --> 02:31:21.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S OUR

02:31:21.772 --> 02:31:23.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOST VULNERABLE KIDS THAT SUFFER

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:24.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN ADULTS DON'T HAVE CLARITY

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:26.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
OR THE CAPACITY TO.

02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:27.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACTUALLY DELIVER ON A HIGH

02:31:27.578 --> 02:31:30.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION.

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:31.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A SO WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AS

02:31:31.816 --> 02:31:32.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY CURRENTLY STAND WHEN WE

02:31:32.516 --> 02:31:33.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOOK AT THE EARLY LEARNING

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:34.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SECTOR.

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:35.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT IS PROBABLY THEM THE MOST

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHALLENGED IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:39.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FUNDAMENTAL STATE ROLE IS.

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:40.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YET WE KNOW WITH THE RECENT

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:42.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BRAIN RESEARCH AND ECONOMIC

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:44.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANALYSES THAT THIS IS WHERE WE

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:45.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CAN HAVE THE MOST. PROFOUND

02:31:45.329 --> 02:31:47.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM IMPACT.

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:48.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
I THINK IF WE HAD THI

02:31:49.066 --> 02:31:50.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INFORMATION MANY YEARS AGO WHEN

02:31:50.601 --> 02:31:51.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE WERE CREATING OUR PUBLICS.

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:54.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION WE WOULD

02:31:54.371 --> 02:31:55.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAVE MADE SURE THAT WE WERE

02:31:55.306 --> 02:31:56.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STARTING MUCH YOUNGER AND THAT'S

02:31:56.974 --> 02:31:57.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY ONLY

02:31:58.042 --> 02:32:00.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOURTEEN PERCENT OF INFANTS AND

02:32:00.377 --> 02:32:01.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TODDLERS THAT ARE EVEN DEEMED

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:03.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ELIGIBLE FOR. SUPPORT.

02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:04.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN THE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM GET

02:32:04.882 --> 02:32:05.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ACCESS TO IT.

02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:07.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE KNOW THAT HIGH QUALITY

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:10.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INFANT CARE COST AS MUCH PER

02:32:10.554 --> 02:32:11.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
YEAR.

02:32:11.989 --> 02:32:14.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ACTION MORE THAN THE USE YOU

02:32:14.124 --> 02:32:17.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SEE TUITION AND OUR.

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:19.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROACH TO THREE AND FOUR YEAR

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:22.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OLDS IS A PATCHWORK WHERE

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:23.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S NO ONE ENTITY THAT'S

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:25.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FUNDAMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:32:25.269 --> 02:32:27.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
QUALITY ACCESS AND OR

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:30.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AFFORDABILITY. I'M ALL OF THESE

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:33.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUTCOMES ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF THE

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FACT THAT THE STATE IS NOT FULLY

02:32:35.913 --> 02:32:39.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLARIFIED WHAT IT WILL OR WON'T

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:42.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROVIDE TO KIDS. AND WE BELIEVE

02:32:42.119 --> 02:32:43.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT BASED ON THE RESEARCH AND

02:32:43.888 --> 02:32:46.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUBLIC SENTIMENT THAT THE STATE

02:32:46.924 --> 02:32:48.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAS TO. MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:32:48.926 --> 02:32:50.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:52.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
QUALITY AFFORDABLE EARLY

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:56.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE STATE SHOULD BE THE

02:32:56.367 --> 02:32:57.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
GUARANTOR.

02:32:57.935 --> 02:32:59.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO ENSURE ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:10.047 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
HAVE ACCESS THAT CHILDREN ACROSS
I ECS OF IT WHAT IS THE STATE

02:33:10.114 --> 02:33:11.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO HOLD ON TO AND WHAT IS

02:33:11.215 --> 02:33:12.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT GOING TO DELEGATE AND WE

02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:13.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BELIEVE THERE AT LEAST FIVE

02:33:13.183 --> 02:33:15.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AREAS WHERE THE STATE. NEEDS TO

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:17.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STEP UP AND PROVIDE EVEN MORE.

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUPPORT ENGAGEMENT AND THAT

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:21.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCLUDES ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH

02:33:21.191 --> 02:33:22.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAS I REFERENCED A LOT TODAY

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

ACCOUNTABILITY FRONT CALIFORNIA

02:33:31.035 --> 02:33:32.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAS MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:34.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RELEASING A NEW STATE DASHBOARD

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:36.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE RIGHT

02:33:41.278 --> 02:33:41.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
REALLY GREAT.

02:33:42.012 --> 02:33:43.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT THERE ARE SOME KEY AREAS

02:33:43.113 --> 02:33:44.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:45.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEEDS TO REALLY ENGAGE IN AND

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
FOCUS ON.

02:33:47.084 --> 02:33:49.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND AND AND POTENTIALLY.
