00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:13.965
ELEMENT OF THIS. AND UNTIL WE

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:17.702
ON WIND AB ONE OH NINE. AND

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:20.772
UNDO PARTS OF PROP FORTY SEVEN

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.373
AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN WE'RE NOT

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.775
GOING TO SOLVE THIS. THAT

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:26.711
ELEMENT OF THE HOMELESSNESS.

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:30.582
AND I EVEN LIKE. ALMOST DON'T

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:31.750
WANT TO CALL IT HOMELESSNESS

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.685
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE MAKING

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:36.254
BAD LIFE CHOICES. BETTER PUT

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:37.522
THEM ON THE STREETS AND SOME OF

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:39.190
THEM WANT TO STAY ON THE

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:40.358
STREETS THEY THEY DON'T WANT

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.193
TO. BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.763
SOCIETY SO UNTIL WE- ADDRESS

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:47.232
THAT CRIMINAL ELEMENT I THINK

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:48.600

AN AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY. MY

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.116
FRUSTRATION REALLY IS WHAT THE

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:47.452
GOVERNOR. MADE A BUNCH OF

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:51.022
PROMISES BOTH IN HIS PAIN AND

00:29:51.089 --> 00:29:55.727
THEN HE EXPECTED THEM IN THE

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:59.998

VERY MUCH SENATE JACKSON HERE I

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.510
WASN'T REALLY PLANNING TO DO A-

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.579
DEFENSE OF THE GOVERNOR BUT I

00:30:14.646 --> 00:30:16.714
WOULD LIKE TO REMIND MY GOOD

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:18.850
CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES. IN

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:20.752
THE TIME OF. STATE OF THE STATE

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.887
SPEECH AND TODAY WE'VE HAD

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:25.590
SOMETHING CALLED COVERT

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:26.391
NINETEEN IF WE WANT TO PUT

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:28.826
BLAME ON ANYONE FOR THAT I

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:29.994
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.896
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE LACK

00:30:31.963 --> 00:30:34.199
OF LEADERSHIP THERE SO THIS

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:35.700
DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:37.602
WITH THE GOVERNOR- AT THIS

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:38.736
MOMENT THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:41.940
SOCIETAL PROBLEM IT'S EXISTED

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:45.143
FOR DECADES AND CALIFORNIA IS

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.412
THE HOME TO MORE HOMELESS

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:49.814
PEOPLE. IN MEASURE BECAUSE YOU

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.583
HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN BEING

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:53.651
HOMELESS IN DECEMBER IN YOUR

00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:54.819
CAR HOMELESS IN DECEMBER IN

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:57.622
CALIFORNIA- YOU WILL TO

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:01.326
CALIFORNIA SO THAT IS PART OF

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:06.297
THE PROBLEM IS THE MAIN. YOU

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:08.666
CAN WE- I THINK IT WAS GOOD AT

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:11.202
THE- HE OPENED UP DORS TO OUR-

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:13.171
AND MANY INSTITUTIONS PROMISING

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:14.639
THAT WE WOULD END UP WITH A

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:17.575
COMMUNITY BASED CARE FOR THOSE

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.677
PEOPLE WHO SUFFER MENTAL

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.913
ILLNESS AND NEVER FUNDED IT. SO

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.748
THAT'S OUR IF WE START LOOKING

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.383
AT WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES OR

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.752
WHERE IT STARTED- THAT BEING

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:28.753
SAID WE HAVE PEOPLE WITH

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.289
TERRIBLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.057
ARE THAT WE HAPPEN TO DRESSED

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:34.859
IN THE WHAT WE DO WITH THEM.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.160
PRIMARILY AS WE PUT THEM IN

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.829
JAIL THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.697
THEIR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:40.865
THEN THEY COME BACK OUT ON THE

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:42.734
STREETS THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.069
THEY RE OFFEND IF YOU WILL WITH

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.738
VAGRANCY OR WHAT HAPPENED AND

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.873
IN THE BACK. I IN IN

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.808
INCARCERATION COSTING THE STATE

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:53.444
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY- THE

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.847
SO CALLED CRIMINAL ELEMENT I

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:57.849
WOULD SUGGEST THOUGH THE

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:01.286
RESULTS ARE RESOLUTE AND IS TO.

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:04.022
A DAM OPPOSITION FORTY SEVEN

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.457
AND OTHERS THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:07.191
REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.993
SYSTEM BUT TO SUPPORT THEM

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.828
BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THOSE

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.764
PROGRAMS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.165
PEOPLE DON'T RESIDENT RIGHT

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.733
THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.802
A JOB TO GO TO ANALYZE TO HALF.

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.271
SO I WASN'T REALLY PLANNING ON

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.239
DOING THAT IN THE DRESSING THIS

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.141
BILL BUT SINCE TO BEG THE

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.143
QUESTION ARE I THINK THAT WE

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.711
REALLY HAVE TO BE HONEST AND

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.012
ACCURATE ABOUT WHAT THE

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:30.315
PROBLEMS ARE SO I WANT TO

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:31.582
SUPPORT THIS AND I WANT TO

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.384
THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.620
BRINGING IT BECAUSE ALMOST HAS

00:32:35.687 --> 00:32:38.690
BEEN A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:39.290
FOR DECADES WHEN I FIRST

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:42.360
STARTED MY LEGAL CAREER RIGHT

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:44.762
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY- CAR WAS

00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:48.366
PROBLEM CREATED ENORMOUS IMPACT

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:51.836

NEED HELP. AND WE NEED TO DO

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.351
BETTER AND I THINK THAT

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.653
CREATING THIS FOCUS AND HAVING

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.857
A SYSTEM. WHERE WE SET UP A-

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.059

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.375
HANGING ON. BY THEIR

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:16.013
FINGERNAILS. AND NOW THEY HAVE

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:16.647
SO MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:21.319
JOBS. THEY ARE IN DIRE STRAITS

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:24.355
AND NOW BECAUSE OF INACTION

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:26.123
FIVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEIR

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.060
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS ARE

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.728
TANKING. THAT IS IF THEY'VE

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.797
BEEN ABLE TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:33.297
BENEFITS BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:37.101
MELTDOWN- ET DE. AND SO WE FACE

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:39.637
THE VERY REAL PROSPECT THAT IN

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:40.404
THE COMING MONTHS I THINK AT

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.974
THE BEGINNING BECAUSE OF MAYBE

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.275
MINIMAL SAVINGS THAT PEOPLE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.844
OUTSIDE OR- BECAUSE THEY GOT

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.145
THE EXTRA SIX HUNDRED

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:49.847
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. OR

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:52.250
RECALLS THAT A LANDLORD WHO IS

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:52.817
UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST FOR A

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.485
LITTLE WHILE. YOU KNOW THERE

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.354
WAS A IS NARRATIVE UNKNOWNS WE

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.256
PEOPLE AREN'T DEFAULTING ON THE

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.524
RENT AND LARGE NUMBERS. OF THAT

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:02.159
IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY I'M

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.895
NOT CHANGED WORK CELERY IN THE

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.763
COMING MONTHS AND WE FACE THE

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.700
VERY REAL PROSPECT OF A HUGE

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:10.568
NUMBER. OF LOW INCOME

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:14.272
CALIFORNIA. BECOMING HOMELESS

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.173
NOW AND IN THE COMING MONTHS.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.808
AND SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:21.412

SEEING IN HOMELESSNESS BUT WHAT

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:30.721
WE CAN ANTICIPATE A SPIKE IN

HOMELESSNESS. OF OUR WORKING

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:36.460
POOR. IN THE COMING MONTHS. IS

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:38.796
THE STRUCTURE. THAT EXECUTIVE

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.565
BRANCH HAS A NET HAS IN PLACE

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:44.201
NOW. ADEQUATE TO THE TASK. TO

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:45.603
DEAL WITH A POTENTIAL

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.638
SIGNIFICANT. SPIKE IN

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.106
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF THIS

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.841
BILL IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT A

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.109
RESTRUCTURING TO BETTER BE

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.244
BETTER EQUIPPED TO CONFRONT

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:57.081
THIS CRISIS. BUT MY QUESTION TO

GO TO WORK AND I WAS ONE OF THE

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:44.388
OLDER CHILDREN SO I WANT TO

A LITTLE OLDER THAN I WAS I WAS

00:38:57.868 --> 00:38:58.969
FOURTEEN AT THE TIME SO I

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.538
FUDGED A LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW I

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:02.273
THINK THERE'S A STATUTE OF

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:08.946
LIMITATIONS FOR THAT BUT. YOU

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.748
KNOW SO I GUESS THAT MAKES ME A

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:14.852
CRIMINAL. IT'S LIKE UP SO

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:22.727
THERE'S. MY OBSERVATION AS-

00:39:22.793 --> 00:39:23.994
YEAH YOU DO THINGS WHEN YOU'RE

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.296
HOMELESS BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:27.498
BE HOMELESS FOREVER OKAY SO YOU

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:30.034
SHOULD HAVE LABELS ON PEOPLE.

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.570
OKAY I THINK PEOPLE RECOVER

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:33.838
FROM HOMELESSNESS HOPEFULLY

00:39:33.904 --> 00:39:37.241
MOST OF THEM DO. AND REACH UP

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:40.311
AND NOT RECOVER. WE'RE GOING TO

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:43.247
HAVE A SITUATION WHERE. WE MAY

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:46.183
FACED AS A PROBABLY WILL FACES-

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:49.286
CENTER WINNER WAS POINTING OUT.

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.654
A GREAT INCREASE IN

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:54.391
HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE HAVE TO WE

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:56.560
HAVE TO TAKE THE POSITIVE

00:39:56.627 --> 00:40:00.030
VIEWPOINT THE. THE PEOPLE THAT

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.565
ARE HOMELESS THAT WILL BECOME

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.901
HOMELESS OR PEOPLE THAT WE CAN

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.737
HELP WE CAN ASSUME THIS WEEKEND.

00:40:06.804 --> 00:40:10.674
DEVELOP STRATEGIES THE BILL

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.877
POINTS OUT AND THAT AND I THINK

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.178
ANOTHER THING WE AGREE THE

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:15.479
REVOLVES ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.248
THINGS HEALTH CARE CRIMINAL

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:22.586
JUSTICE. ALL THE ELEMENTS. AND

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.221
IT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY SHOULD

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:28.559
WORK TOGETHER. AS A TEAM. THAT

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.494
THE BILL REQUIRES GENERAL CROSS

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.297
SYSTEM GENERAL CROSS SYSTEM SO

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:34.799
SORRY TAKEN POINTING OUT SOME

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.400
OF THE ASSETS THAT I SEE IN THE

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:43.374
BILL. THE MENTAL HEALTH THING.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.943
ONLY 14% OF PEOPLE GET ADEQUATE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.612
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT'S

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.481
GOING TO THAT IS A PROBLEM TO

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.283
HAVE DENTURES 0% GET ADEQUATE

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.984
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IF THEY

00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:59.890
BECOME HOMELESS. SO I CHECKED.

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:00.991
I THINK THIS IS A VERY

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.293
IMPORTANT BILL IN TERMS OF

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.128
GETTING THE GOVERNOR PUTTING IT

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.863
IN THE GOVERNOR OFFICE AS

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.097
OPPOSED TO LETTING EACH

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:09.567
DEPARTMENT OR EACH AGENCY DO

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.602
WITH ALMOST A SEPARATELY I

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:12.203
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:16.540
WE NOT. HAVE SERVE A KEYSTONE

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:19.076
COPS APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.378
THAT WE HAVE A COORDINATED

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:25.549
EFFICIENT. APPROACH AND NOT

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:27.418
WASTE MONEY CHASING RAINBOWS

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:28.752
ARECHOOSING DIFFERENT

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.120
SOLUTIONS IN EACH EACH LITTLE

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:31.689
BOX THAT WE PUT OURSELVES AND

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:34.024
THEN THE DEPARTMENTS AND

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:37.428
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACIES SO HI

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.630
I THINK THIS IS A- I. THINK

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:40.831
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE OF

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:43.234
CROSS SYSTEMS KIND OF ISSUES

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.768
THAT COVER MOST APART DIFFERENT

00:41:44.835 --> 00:41:47.171
DEPARTMENTS AND- I APPRECIATE

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.005
THE BILL I THOUGHT IT WAS A

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:50.074
WISE BOTH. OF THE DISPLAYED

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.976
SOME WISDOM. THAT WE NEED TO

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.477
HAVE IN THE LIGHT OF THE CRISIS

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:56.780
THERE WERE AND SO- JUICE HERE

00:41:56.847 --> 00:42:00.217
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU.

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.686
SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MEASURE

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:03.888
AND APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.856
I DECIDE ANOTHER REFERENCE WAS

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:08.692
MADE TO MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:11.595
USE AND HOMELESSNESS I JUST DO

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.197
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- WILL

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:16.700
CERTAINLY MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:19.069
COULD EXXON OR VULNERABLE TO

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.604
BECOMING HOMELESS IT'S USUALLY

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.339
THE OTHER WAY AROUND IT'S WHAT

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.340
HAPPENS IS THAT THROUGH

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:25.209
ECONOMIC MEANS OR OTHER WAYS

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:27.444
PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS AND THEN

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:29.546
THERE MENTAL. SUBSTANCE USE

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:31.682
INCREASES BECAUSE YOU LOSE THE

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.550
SOCIAL SUPPORT AND VARIOUS

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:34.118
OTHER FACTORS WILL GO INTO

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.220
RIGHT NOW SO- I KNOW THAT

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:37.554
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:39.423
WELL YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:39.990
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHO ARE

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.059
HOMELESS. JUST KEEP IN MIND

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.861
THAT THERE HOMELESSNESS IS BY

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:45.362
WHAT'S EXACERBATING OR MENTAL

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.164
HEALTH ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:47.598
ITSELF DOESN'T CAUSE

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:51.001
HOMELESSNESS. NECESSARILY AND-

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.636
ATTACK THAT'S WHY HOUSING FIRST

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:53.871
IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.739
DIVERGENCE BASED APPROACH TO

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:58.275
ADDRESSING THESE SSUES AS WELL

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:58.842
BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.844
SOMEONE INTO A HOME- INTO A

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.313
PLACE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.114
START TACKLING THESE ISSUES I

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.149
THINK A CENTER BILL SAID.

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.517
PROBABLY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.052
HOMELESS OR UNLIKELY TO BE

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:08.953
GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:10.387
BUT ALSO POINT OUT THAT BEING

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:11.689
HOMELESS ITSELF IS. A RISK

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.190
FACTOR FOR EXACERBATIONS OF

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:14.959
THOSE CONDITIONS SO WITH THAT I

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:18.562
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.197

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:29.006
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I'M AND I

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:32.142
COMMEND THAT AND I'D AND I'D-

00:43:32.209 --> 00:43:34.712
RESPECT THE OPINION COMING FROM

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.146
MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.882
COMMITTEE- AND IT'S YOU KNOW

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:39.616
IT'S IT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.151
DESERES TO BE DEALT WITH

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:43.053
COMPASSIONATELY I'M REGARDLESS

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.788
OF WHY YOU THINK A PERSON IS

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:47.825
HOMELESS- IT IT IS A

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:50.761
COMPASSIONATE ISSUE- BUT MY

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:56.767
ISSUE. WITH THE BILL IS THAT. I

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.435
DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

00:43:58.502 --> 00:44:01.805
CREATE ANOTHER- CIRCLE OF

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:04.008
BUREAUCRACY TO DEAL WITH THE

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.642
ISSUE I THINK THERE ARE A LOT

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.444
OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:08.445
I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:09.513
COMING FROM THAT YOU FEEL LIKE

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.748
SOME SORT OF CENTRALIZED

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.484
OVERSIGHT MAKES MORE SENSE BUT-

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.453
HONESTLY I FEEL AS THOUGH IT

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.921
NEEDS TO BE. ANY TO CONTINUE

00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.090
PERHAPS MORE SAID LOCAL LEVEL

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.292
RATHER THAN FROM THE TOP DOWN-

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:25.796
BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR.

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:26.764
THOSE OF US APPEARING

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.432
SACRAMENTO TO KNOW EXACTLY

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.300
WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.136
IN SOME OF THESE COUNTIES- I

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:35.773
HAD. A COMMUNICATION WITH-

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:38.142
SOMEONE IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.410
ACTUALLY THIS WEEKEND WHO IS

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.545
HOMELESS AND SHE WAS VERY

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:43.781
FRUSTRATED THAT POLITICIANS

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.682
KEEP YOU KNOW THAT WE KEEP

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.384
TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:50.254
AND- THE HER FEELING WAS THE

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.222
PROBLEM IS BECAUSE LIVING IS

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:54.391
TOO HIGH WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:56.160
TO LOWER THE COST OF LIVING AND

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:59.663
THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY- MAKING IT

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.365
WORSE. BY GETTING MORE INVOLVED

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.467
AT THE TOP. IN THIS IS SOMEONE

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:06.070
WHO'S LIVING IT YOU KNOW SHE'S

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.971
WORKING BY. HE JUST CAN'T

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.840
AFFORD THE COST OF LIVING HERE

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:12.576
SO UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH I'D I

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.578
KNOW WHERE YOUR HEART IS ON

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.346
THIS BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.048
THAT I'M NOT. GOING TO BE ABLE

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:18.982
TO SUPPORT THE BILL SIMPLY

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:23.053
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. IT NEEDS

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.322
TO GO LOWER RATHER THAN GO

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.124
HIGHER BUT I DO THINK THAT WE

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:28.892
ALL ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:31.528
RESPECT TO. GETTING SOME THINGS

00:45:31.595 --> 00:45:32.830
DONE THAT ACTUALLY ALLEVIATE

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.031
THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE AS SOME OF

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:35.332
MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED THIS

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.167
HOMELESSNESS ISSUE HAS ONLY

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:39.603
GOTTEN WORSE IN CALIFORNIA OVER

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.772
MANY MANY YEARS. AND NO MATTER

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.942
WHAT POLITICIANS. TRY TO DO IT

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:46.343
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE GETTING

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.411
ANY BETTER IN FACT IT ACTUALLY

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.947
SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE SO I

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:51.648
AM LESS INCLINED. TO SUPPORT A

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:57.955
GROUP THAT IS HEADED BY. PEOPLE

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.456
FRANKLY WHO WERE FRIENDS TO THE

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.625
CITIES I HAVE SOME OF THE WORST

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:04.862
HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE- TO.

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:07.197
ME TO PUT MY SUPPORT. BEHIND

THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE AT

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.073

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:24.047
DISCUSSION I THINK IT SHOWS HOW

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:28.652
IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS TO ALL

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.654

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:36.059
ALL TO BE ALL THE TO SEE I

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:36.994
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.795
GOVERNOR HAS DONE SO FAR TO

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.931
ELEVATE HOMELESSNESS- AS

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.666
SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED IT'S

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.968
ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS- SINCE

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:46.403
THE STATE OF THE STATE WE ARE

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.871
STILL IN THIS YEAR AND THIS IS

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:50.908
STILL AN OPPORTUNITY- TO START.

00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:53.610
BOND OR CONTINUE THE WORK ON

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.979
HOMELESSNESS- BY BY EIGHT

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:57.948
CREATING THIS THIS GOVERNANCE

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:00.017
STRUCTURE THAT'S DESIGNED TO BE

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:02.553
MORE EFFECTIVE- AND TO

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.888
STREAMLINE OUR EXISTING

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:08.725
PROGRAMS- YOU KNOW AT. LEADERS

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.561
I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE

00:47:10.627 --> 00:47:12.863
BENEFITS OF CREATING THIS.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.832
LASTING STRUCTURAL CHANGE TO.

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.935
THE CENTRALIZED OFFICE ON

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.870
HOMELESSNESS IS NOT SOMETHING.

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:21.605
THAT CAN BE DONE VIA EXECUTIVE

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.373
ORDER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.008
THE LEGISLATURE COULD PUT INTO

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:28.645
STATUTE. AND CREATE THIS OFFICE

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:31.682
SO IT CONTINUES TO EXIST.

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:35.586
BEYOND THIS. ADMINISTRATION OF.

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.154
OUR FOCUS ON HOMELESSNESS NOT

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:39.122
BE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS OF AN

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:42.025

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.827
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:46.563
OF YOU KNOW PRIORITIZES AND

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.399
CONTINUES TO WORK ON- BEYOND

00:47:49.466 --> 00:47:52.469
THE ADMINISTRATION. LIKE THIS

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:54.371
IS JUST THIS ISSUE OF COURSE

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:56.273
LIKE YOU HAVE MENTIONED IS NOT

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.275

GOVERNMENTS- HAVE DONE A LOT OF

00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:02.946

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:07.251

BECAUSE OF THAT ELEMENT- AND

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.401
IT. ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE VALID

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:47.936
CONCERNS THAT THEY GET TO

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.105
EXISTING LAW AND NOT TO THE

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:53.208
BILL ITSELF SO THIS ADDRESSES A

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.311
SITUATION WITHIN TO COUNTIES-

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:57.646
WHERE THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:00.115
ASKING FOR THE ABILITY TO-

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:03.151

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.859
THINK THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.996
DO HAVE. SOME VALIDITY TO THEM

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.298
SIGNIFICANT POLITICALLY HOW IT

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:17.866

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.268
HOMELESS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:22.437
AS OTHERS AND THAT- WE KNOW

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:23.905
THAT EXISTING LAW DOESN'T

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:26.074
NECESSARILY RESPECT THE ON A

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.242
TON OF MANY OF THE AND

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:30.012
SHELTERED BUT- GIVEN THE FACT

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.381
THAT THIS BILL JUST SIMPLY-

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:34.583
OPERATES UNDER EXISTING LAW.

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:37.686
AND WE'RE NOT BEING ASKED TO

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:38.553
REEVALUATE THOSE PROPERTY

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.622
RIGHTS MY HOPE FUTURE LUNCH

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:43.392

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:43.992
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:47.329
RIGHT I DO WHAT I DID IN HIGH.

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:47.963
THAT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:53.535

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:56.204
