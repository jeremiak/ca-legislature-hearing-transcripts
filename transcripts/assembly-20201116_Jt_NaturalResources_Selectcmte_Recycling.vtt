DEPARTMENT THAT'S- ONE OF THE

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:56.133
THINGS THAT THERE'S NOT. GREAT

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.035
OF FULLER. OF ALL OF THE

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.236
PLASTIC THAT COMES INTO THE

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.438
STATE ON EXACTLY WHERE ALL

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.006
THAT. PLASTIC ENDS UP WHETHER

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.409
EXPORTED- OR RECYCLED

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.911
DOMESTICALLY WITHOUT YOUR

PIECES OF INFORMATION ON THAT

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.413
WE'RE GONNA. TRY TO HIT ON SOME

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.081
OF THOSE KEY PIECES OF

00:39:10.147 --> 00:39:11.949
INFORMATION BUT- I'M JUST NOT

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.818

ALL THE PLASTIC AND EXACTLY

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.721
WHERE IT GOES- IT WAS THAT WE

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:18.956
WERE ABLE TO FIND. SO IF YOU

OVERALL AMOUNTS OF WASTE THAT.

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:30.801
I WENT INTO LANDFILLS IN TWENTY

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.870
EIGHTEEN. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:34.472

PLASTIC TO ABOUT 12% OF. OVER

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.477
ALWAYS THAT WENT INTO LANDFILLS

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.312
WAS PLASTIC. THAT'S ABOUT FOUR

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:43.748
POINT FIVE MILLION TONS- IN

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.216
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND AS YOU

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:45.716
KNOW THERE'S A THAT THIS

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.284

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.853
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC-

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.288
MATERIALS FROM. TWO CONTAINERS

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.023
TO TRASH BAGS TO BEVERAGE

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.925
CONTAINERS AND SOME CASES. TOYS

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:57.194
AND FURNITURE- AND THEN IN

OVER TIME- THE OVERALL PERCENT

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.501

POINT 6% TO ELEVEN POINT 5% TO

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:13.310
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO THAT IS. HAS

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:13.911
GONE UP OF THE LAST DECADE OR

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:17.014

AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:37.535
HAS REMAINED. RELATIVELY

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.904
STEADY. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.374
YEARS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT-

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.075
HOWEVER I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT-

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.477
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:47.077
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.679
SUBJECT TO THE PROGRAM PLASTIC

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:51.348
ONES. ARE REALLY ONLY MAKE UP A

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.917
VERY SMALL SHARE OF THE OVERALL

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.518
AMOUNT OF PLASTIC. AND THE

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.853
STATE AND THESE ARE THE TYPES

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.988
OF- CONTAINERS THAT- ARE MORE

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:58.923
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.457
RECYCLED- BUT THEY ARE VERY

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:02.092
SMALL SHARE OF KIND OF OVERALL

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.861
PLASTIC IN THE STATE. ESTIMATED

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.696
ABOUT TWO TO THREE PERCENT. OF

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:08.499
OVERALL PLASTIC- AND THE IN

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.034
TERMS OF THE OVERALL VOLUME

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.702
AMOUNT OF CONTAINERS- ALTHOUGH

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:13.170
THE RECYCLING RATE AS MAY

00:41:13.237 --> 00:41:15.673
REMAIN RELATIVELY STEADY- THE

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.408
OVERALL VOLUME HAS INCREASED

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:18.809
SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE TWENTY TEN

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:21.178
SO. FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION- OF

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:21.879
THESE PLASTIC BEVERAGE

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.681
CONTAINERS AND TWENTY TEN HAS

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.649
GROWN TO. ABOUT NINE POINT TWO

00:41:25.716 --> 00:41:27.751
BILLION. OTHERS A MINOR TYPO

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:28.719
AND THEIR RECENT MILLION BUT

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.955
IT'S- NINE POINT TWO BILLION.

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:31.989
AND TWENTY NINETEEN JUST TO

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:36.560
GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR- THE SCALE

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:38.462
THERE. AND THEN FINALLY- IF YOU

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:42.600
TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR- OF

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:43.534
THE HANDOUT OR SCROLL TO PAGE

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:46.437
FIVE- HERE'S SOME INFORMATION

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:49.940
ON- ON PLASTIC EXPORTS. IN

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.543
RECENT YEARS- HISTORICALLY MOST

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.944
RECYCLABLE PLASTIC HAS BEEN

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:56.213
EXPORTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES-

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.049
IT'S THROUGH CITRIX WORKS- AND

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:00.284
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.852
HERE- THERE'S BEEN A

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.721
SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:05.422
AMOUNT OF PLASTICS OF RIGHT IT

00:42:05.489 --> 00:42:06.557
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.592
THAT HAVE BEEN EXPORTED- OVER

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:11.028
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- EXPORT.

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:13.597
OF PLASTIC SAYS DECLINES DUE TO

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.899
INCREASED REGULATIONS AND

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.300
RESTRICTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.269
IMPORTS OF PLASTIC WASTE AS I'M

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.104
SURE. MOST OR ALL OF YOUR

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.538
FAMILIAR WITH CHINA'S NATIONAL

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:23.641
SWORD POLICY IS ONE OF THE- ONE

00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:25.042
EXAMPLE OF THAT I WHICH IS KIND

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.876
OF RESTRICTED THE AMOUNT OF

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:28.045
PLASTICS- THAT BUT CAN BE

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:30.180
EXPORTED. AND THERE ARE SOME

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.348
THE LAST BUT WE KNOW THERE IS

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:32.449
THERE ARE SOME NEW GLOBAL

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.251
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PLAN TO

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:36.020
BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:37.054
ONE WHICH COULD. EVEN FURTHER

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:40.090
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.092
THAT CAN BE EXPORTED- WITH THE

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.628
INTENT OF BEING RECYCLED- SO

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:45.496
GETTING BACK TO KIND OF UR

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.431
EARLIER POINT. YOU CAN SEE FROM

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:48.265
THE CHART THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:49.967
THE- AMOUNT OF PLASTICS

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.669
EXPORTED HAS DECREASED

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.938
SIGNIFICANTLY BUT- WE DON'T

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:55.973
KNOW EXACTLY- AT LEAST ON THE

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.674
DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN AS

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.509
EXACTLY. WHERE ALL OF THAT

00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:00.110
PLASTIC HAS GONE SOME OF THAT

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:03.514
pDOMESTICALLY POTENTIALLY. I

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.014
SUMMIT COULD END UP IN

00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:05.582
LANDFILLS COULD END UP IN OTHER

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:07.051
PLACES SO THAT'S I THINK ONE OF

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.585
THE- AN EXAMPLE OF KIND OF THAT

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:10.821
DATA GAP ON INFORMATION THAT WE

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:11.822
DON'T HAVE A GREAT AND A LOT OF

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:14.291
THIS PLAN IT SEEMS. IS EXACTLY.

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:16.393
WHERE THAT- PLASTIC IT'S GOING.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.863
NOW SO- I WILL IN MY COMMENTS

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.165

PLASTICS OR LIKE I CALL IT THAT

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.449
THAT CYCLE OF CLASSICS SO IT

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.951
ALL STARTS WITH EXTRACTION AND

FACTOR THEY HAVE TO BE

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:03.554

DOLLAR STORES ARE LOCATED- IN

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:31.014
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THEY

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:32.816
BASICALLY PROMOTE THEIR VALUE

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.284
BECAUSE OF HOW CHEAP AND

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:36.220
CONVENIENT THEY ARE. AND WE

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:38.989
KNOW ALSO THAT THEY HAVE.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:41.158
SUBSTANCES LIKE BPA BPF AND

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:44.161
FOLLETT'S. THAT ENDS UP HAVING

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:47.898
A- TOXIC IMPACT IN IN OUR

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:50.133

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.340
REUSABLE- AND AGAIN THEIR

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:58.609
TENDER BASICALLY PROMOTED IN.

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.377
AJ COMMUNITIES WE ALSO KNOW

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:02.145
THAT SHE FABRICS ALSO PROMOTING

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.714
EAGER COMMUNITIES AND THOSE

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.182
MICROPLASTICS END UP IN OUR

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:07.751
WATERWAYS- IN THOSE ARE AND THE

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:10.220
CONGRESS OFFICE AS WELL NEXT

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:14.057
SLIDE PLEASE. I'M AND AGAIN

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.626
BECAUSE WE'RE USING THESE-

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:18.262
CHEAP. AERIALS THAT JUST

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:20.030
BREAKDOWN FOR FAIRLY EASY WE

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:21.398
KNOW WE HAVE TO HOLD THEM AND

00:48:21.465 --> 00:48:23.467
THAT MEANS MORE EXPENSIVE

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.969
DRIVING THEM TO LANDFILLS AND

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:30.107
GETTING RID OF THEM- AND THE-

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.242
THAT WAYS AND THE CREATING. A

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:34.311
METHANE AND METHANE IS A REALLY

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:35.779
POTENT GAS THAT IS CONTRIBUTING

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.347
TO CLIMATE CHANGE NEXT SLIDE

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:43.620
PLEASE. SO EVEN IF WE DISCARDED

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:45.656
WASTE PROPERLY WE KNOW THAT

00:48:45.722 --> 00:48:46.657
HE'S GOING TO FIND A WAY TO THE

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:49.226
OCEAN AND LAND AND LANDFILLS.

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.061
UP AGAIN- WHERE PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.230
LIVE. AND THEY'RE GETTING

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:55.732
EXPOSED TO EVEN MORE POLLUTION-

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.567
SOME OF THE WAYS AND OF BEING

00:48:57.634 --> 00:48:59.202
INCINERATED AND NOW WE KNOW

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.605
THAT THEIR ALSO TELLING- WASTE

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:04.975
TO ENERGY- SCHEMES THAT ARE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.743
ALSO OF. HURTING EITHER

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.512
COMMUNITIES AND WE NEED TO

00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:10.080
REALLY FIND A WAY TO STOP

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:12.816
THESE. THAT CYCLE NEXT SLIDE

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:18.488
PLEASE. I'M MORE FULLY FROM

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:19.756
BEGINNING TO THE OCEAN ALSO

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.525
MEANS MUCH THAT SOUNDS AN

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:22.326
INCREASE OF SENATORS

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:24.194
ACIDIFICATION LESSON SILVA

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.296
FORTUNE OFF CARBON. ON THE

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.564
CLIMATE CRISIS IS AFFECTING

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:28.332
EITHER COMMUNITIES

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.467
PROPORTIONALLY AND THE PLASTIC

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.202
IS CONTRIBUTING TO IT. AB

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.503
PREVALENCE OF MICROPLASTICS IN

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.906
THE OCEAN WITH OTHER ADVOCATION

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:36.940
FEEL THE BOTTOM OF THE FOOD

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.709
CHAIN. AND THAT'S AFFECTING

00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:40.610
BIODIVERSITY AND THE FOOD CHAIN

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:45.882
AS A WHOLE MAKEMAKES LIKELY. WE

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:47.584
SIMPLY CANNOT RECYCLE THE WAY

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.986
OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. MOST

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:52.489
PROFESSORS ARE NOT RECYCLED AND

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:55.225
THOSE THAT DO RECYCLE ONES

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.094
BECAUSE MANY FACTORS PREFER

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.063
MATERIALS. AT RECYCLING ALSO

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.798
GENERATES GREENHOUSE GASES ARE

00:50:01.865 --> 00:50:03.033
YOU NEED MORE ENERGY TO RECYCLE

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.503
THOSE PLASTICS. AND RECYCLING

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:06.970
PLANTS AND OF ANY TO

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:10.073
COMMUNITIES- WORLDWIDE 90% OF

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.641
PLASTICS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE

00:50:11.708 --> 00:50:14.344
RECYCLED 12% ARE INCINERATED.

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.280
AND 79% ARE EITHER LANDFILL OR

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.316
IN THE IN THE OCEAN. SO WITH

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.084
THAT I'M CLOSING MY REMARKS AND

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:24.354
I'M OPENING FOR QUESTIONS AND

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:25.522
ANSWERS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:26.890
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.859
TO ASK THE QUESTIONS AT THE END

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:30.660
OF THE PANEL SO IF YOU DON'T

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:31.294
MIND JUST STANDING BY WE

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.230
APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU VERY

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.965

ROCHMAN PROFESSOR WITH THE

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:39.436
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. WHO I

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.004
BELIEVE IS BY PHONE IF THE

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:45.041
MODERATOR COMPLETES CONNECTOR.

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:48.078
AND CAL THE AIRLINE AS THE OPEN.

HEAR YOU AND WE ALSO SEE YOUR

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:56.653
POWER POINT. OKAY WONDERFUL I

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.122
CAN'T BUT I WILL- SUGGEST WHEN

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.791
HIS ADVANCE FLY THAT HOPES WILL

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:02.692
BE OKAY. I JUST WANT TO START

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.995
BY BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:07.097
FRIEDMAN AND MCCARTY MCCARTY

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:09.366
FOR INVITING ME TO GATHER TO

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:10.600
GIVE ME SOME TIME I GUESS TO

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.535
TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.804
ISSUE- MY NAME IS HEALTHY ROCK

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.005
MAN I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:16.640
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. AND BUT

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:18.842
I DID ALL OF MY SCHOOLING IN

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.777
CALIFORNIA AND LIVED THERE FOR

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:22.712
QUITE SOME TIME SO IT IT. GREAT

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.614
TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE- TODAY

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:25.682
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:26.450
GROWING EMISSIONS OF

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.652
MICROPLASTICS MOSTLY FOCUSING

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:30.987
ON THEIR IMPACTS AND TO THESE

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.222
ARE THE BIG PLASTIC THAT

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:33.723
EVENTUALLY BREAK DOWN INTO

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:39.429
SMALLER CLASSIC. THAT ARE SO.

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.231
IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:41.998
THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY. SAY

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:43.800
THAT WE ARE AGREE- INTO

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:44.835
FIFTEEN. BUT THE WORLD DECIDED

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:46.269
THAT EIGHT MILLION TONS OF

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:48.071
PLASTIC GOING INTO THE OCEAN

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.806
WOULD NOT OKAY THIS WAS A

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:51.274
FAMOUS DETECT THAT WAS SHARED

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:54.144
BY JANET YEAH BACK IN THE PAPER

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:55.278
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. YOUR THE

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.647
NEXT SLIDE WE RECENTLY TRIED TO

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.850
UPDATE THIS ARE WE GET UPDATE

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.318
THIS MODEL TO COME UP WITH.

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.353
MORE AT CURRENT NUMBERS HOW

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.088
MUCH PLASTIC DEBRIS WAS BEING

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.656
ADMITTED INTO AQUATIC

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.458
ECOSYSTEMS. THIS IS WORK DONE

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:10.060
THAT INCLUDED JENNA JAMBECK BUT

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:12.429
WAS LED BY DR AL. CAME OUT IN

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.197
SCIENCE IF YOU WEEKS AGO WE

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.599
PREDICTED THAT THAT NUMBER HAD

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.400
INCREASED THE NINETEEN TO

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:18.869
TWENTY THREE. MILLION TONS OF

00:52:18.935 --> 00:52:20.704
PLASTIC BEING ADMITTED INTO

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:23.006
YOUR QUALITY CONSISTENT IN

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:23.707
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TODAY IT'S

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.909
ABOUT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.511
FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS. WE

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:29.079
HAVEN'T DECREASED OUR EMISSIONS

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:31.114
AND FACT WE'VE INCREASED OUR

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:32.215
EMISSIONS AND IF YOU GO TO THE

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:33.950
NEXT SLIDE. IF YOU FOLLOW THAT

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.119
YELLOW LINE WE PREDICT THAT

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.687
UNDER BUSINESS AS USUAL ALL THE

00:52:37.754 --> 00:52:39.489
WITH NO MEDICATION AND

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:40.323
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.392
TODAY. THAT WILL BE UP TO

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:44.594
ALMOST NINETY MILLION TONNES

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.063
ATTENTION ONLY. BY TWENTY

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:47.797
THIRTY WHICH WOULD BE A FOUR

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:50.066
FOLD INCREASE FROM THAT TWENTY

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:52.002
SIXTEEN NUMBER. LUCKILY NO ONE

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.904
THE GREED ON THE SCENARIO WHICH

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.206
IS WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY. TO

00:52:56.273 --> 00:53:00.977
DISCUSS. PLASTIC POLLUTION IN

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:01.811
OUR ENVIRONMENT. IF YOU GO TO

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:04.247
THE NEXT SLIDE. AND PART TODAY

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:05.982
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HOW. THESE

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:09.152
PLANS AT OUR PARTY KEEP. IN

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:11.454
THEY DO TO MARINE AND FOR. LIFE

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:13.323
SO KNOW THAT. LARGE PIECES OF

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.258
PLASTIC LITTER OUR ENVIRONMENT

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.793
FROM THE POLE TO THE EQUATOR

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.962
AND FROM THE SURFACE OF THE

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:19.930
OCEAN TO THE D. T. WHILE WE

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:22.032
KNOW THAT BYE WEEK MOST OF THIS

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.967
MATERIAL IS LARGE PLASTIC. IF

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.735
YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.637
MAJORITY OF BY COUNTY ARE

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.773
MICROPLASTICS. THIS IS AN

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:32.142
INCREDIBLY DIVERSE CONTAMINANT

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.543
IT INCLUDES MANY DIFFERENT

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.611
TYPES OF PLASTIC THAT ARE

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:37.380
BROKEN DOWN FROM A DIVERSE AND-

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:39.249
NUMBER OF PRODUCTS. THEY ALL

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.684
HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS IN

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.152
THEM THEY RANGE IN DIFFERENT

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.787
SIZES FROM THE NANO TO

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.022
MICROMETERS RANGE. IN DIFFERENT

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:47.791
SHAPES DIFFERENT COLORS AND

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:48.425
DIFFERENT CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.427
WITH THAT. AND THE NEXT FLIGHT

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.195
SHOWS BUT THEY'RE EVERYWHERE

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.463
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY QUITE

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.599
PERVASIVE. YOU WANT A LOT ABOUT

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.534
THIS ISSUE OVER THE YEARS. AND

00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.703
THAT INCLUDES. IF YOU GO TO THE

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.538
NEXT SLIDE. THE FACT THAT THE

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:02.806
CONTAMINATION IS REALLY

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.474
WIDESPREAD SO I SAID THIS

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:06.676
EARLIER ABOUT LARGE PLASTIC.

00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:09.145
MICROPLASTICS ARE OFTEN SEEN IN

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:15.919
EVERY SINGLE ECOSYSTEM. NEXT

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:28.465
SLIDE. WE ALSO SEE THEM AND HOT.

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.199
AND SOMETIMES THESE

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:31.701
CONCENTRATIONS ARE QUITE HIGH

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:34.371
NEXT SLIDE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.139
AB Q. ORGANISMS WHERE THE

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.041
CONCENTRATION OR THE NUMBER OF

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.142
PARTICLES IN THE BODY WAS

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.877
ASTOUNDING THE PICTURE ON THE

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.278
LEFT IN THE BROWN'S BULL HAD

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:44.014
TAKEN FROM LAKE ONTARIO NEAR

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.783
TORONTO WITH NINE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.251
PARTICLES IN IT STANEK. AND THE

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.552
PICTURE ON THE RIGHT IS THE

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.888
SHARK THAT HAD MORE THAN THIRTY

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.589
EIGHT HUNDRED PIECES OF

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.491
PARTICLES OF MICROPLASTIC IN

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:55.859
ITS STOMACH. NOW THAT HIGH

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:57.894
CONTAMINATION IS NOT JUST

00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:00.463
RELEVANT TO AQUATIC ANIMAL IF

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.265
YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.267
CAN SEE HOW IT'S ALSO RELEVANT

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.870
TO HUMAN WE EXTRACT RESOURCES

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:08.238
FROM OUR OCEAN AND FRESH WATER

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:12.542
TO EAT WE ALSO TAKES ALL. ALSO

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.978
TO EAT. AND IF YOU'RE NOT BY.

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:15.645
WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.514
UNDERSTAND THAT MICROPLASTIC

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.482
ISN'T DRINKING WATER. WE KNOW A

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.483
LOT MORE ABOUT FRESH WATER

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.252
SYSTEMS IN THE CONTAMINATION

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:23.920
THAT THEY HAVE. AND IF FOR

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:25.855
EXAMPLE IF I TURN ON MY CAP

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:26.823
RIGHT HERE AT HOME IN LAKE

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.925
ONTARIO THE THREE IMAGES ON THE

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.694
BOTTOM ARE WHAT WE SEE UNDER A

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.095
MICROSCOPE AND OUR VERY OWN

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:34.130
LAB. SO WE KNOW THAT THEIR

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.965
ENVIRONMENT IS CONTAMINATED AND

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.500
WE KNOW THAT IT'S COMING BACK

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.369
TO HAUNT US ON OUR OWN DINNER

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:41.104
PLATE. SO THAT REALLY WAIT

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.306
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT NEXT

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.775
SLIDE WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.477
MICROPLASTICS WHAT ARE THE

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:50.080
EFFECTS TO HUMANS AND WHAT ARE

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:51.614
THE AFFECTED ANIMALS. THERE ARE

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:53.383
THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:57.587
I PUT THE FACTS INTO THE TO GO

00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.122
TO THE NEXT SLIDE. BIG INCLUDE

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:02.092
A STATE MOTIVE IN. PLASTIC

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.526
UNION JACK. TRANSFERRING TO THE

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.528
LIVER OR KIDNEY MAY BE CAUSING

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:07.997
INFLAMMATION. OR PLASTIC BEING

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:09.666
INGESTED IN HIGH CONCENTRATION

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:12.001
CAUSING MORTALITY IN A FISH

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.036
BECAUSE THEY ATE SO MUCH

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:14.137
PLASTIC THEY DIDN'T EAT THE

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.606
FOOD THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE.

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:18.508
YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WE

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.343
SEE EVIDENCE OF A FAX FROM

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.546
CHEMICALS ADDITIVES TO PLASTIC

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.981
SO HERE ON THE TOP ARTISTS

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:27.016
EXPOSED TO THE LEACHATE THAT

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.685
TIRED THAT THE COMMON MICRO

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.487
PLASTIC IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:32.355
N. B. AND B. WHERE THEY WERE

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.690
EXPOSED TO THE LEACHATE THEY'VE

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.225
LOCKED THE PIGMENTATION IN

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:36.960
THEIR EYES. THIS IS A CHEMICAL

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:39.729
OF FACT WE ALSO SEE IN WORMS

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.431
AND IN FACT FROM THE

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:43.466
MICROPLASTIC WITH ADDITIVES AND

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:45.368
THE ADDITIVE ALONE BUT NOT THE

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.070
PLASTIC IF WE REMOVE THE

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.172
CHEMICAL ADDITIVE SO EVIDENCE

00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:51.074
AGAIN OF A CHEMICAL BACK. AND

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.909
THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS EVIDENCE

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:55.278
OF THE FACT THAT COULD BE FROM

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:57.180
THE CHEMICALS THAT START TO

00:56:57.247 --> 00:57:00.250
ACCUMULATE ON THE MICROPLASTICS

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:00.750
WHEN THEY END UP IN THE

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:02.719
ENVIRONMENT. SO THE MINUTE A

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:05.155
PIECE OF MICROPLASTIC HIT DATA

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.190
QUITE ECOSYSTEM START TO

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.291
ACCUMULATE THE PESTICIDES IN

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.592
THE FLAME RETARDANT IN THE

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:11.394
METALS AND THE OTHER CHEMICALS

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:12.762
THAT ARE THERE AND THOSE CAN

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:15.532
ALSO CAUSE INCREASED. AS YOU

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:17.901
SEE ON THE TOP RIGHT OR EVEN

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.669
THE TUMOR IN THE LIVER OF A

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.738
FISH BUT YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.506
RIGHT AND THESE ARE STUDIES

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.275
WE'VE DONE IN MY LAB BOTH AT UC

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:27.177
DAVIS WHEN I WAS AT MY POST DOC

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:34.017
AS WELL AS- IN MY LAB HERE IN

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.451
TORONTO. SO THE NEXT FLIGHT GET

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.653
THREE. THE ACTUALLY YOU WANT

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.154
JUST GO ALL THE WAY TO THE

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:40.757
WHITE YOU CAN THE THREE THINGS.

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.759
THERE'S A QUICK IF YOU TO. THIS

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.761
SHOW THAT THERE IS AN- YOU

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:46.362
MICHAEL. MAKING THE DIFFERENT

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:47.764
TACK. BUT THEY ALSO IN

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:48.998
ORGANISMS ACROSS THE WELL OF BY.

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:51.467
OR SO THEY CAN CAUSE A TOXIC

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:53.436
EFFECT IN THE BODY BUT THOSE

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:54.804
EFFECTS CAN ALSO LEAD TO A

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.472
POPULATION LEVEL ATTRACT.

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:57.874
INCREASING OR DECREASING THE

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.943
POPULATION. MORE CHANGING THE

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:02.378
COMMUNITY. SO ON THE NEXT

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.180
FLIGHT WHICH SHOULD LOOK LIKE A

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.449
I AM A WHITE GRASS WITH LEVELS

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.951
OF ORGANIZATION ON THE ON THE

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.652
Y. AXIS THROUGHOUT THE LAST AT

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:11.855
THE SIDE OF ON THE BOTTOM. WE

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.790
LOOK ACROSS THE LITERATURE CARE

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.158
GIPHY HOW MUCH EVIDENCE IS

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.727
THERE AN IMPACT FROM PLASTIC.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.562
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A MINUTE

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:20.496
WHAT HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THERE

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:22.866
IS. AND THE DARKER THE SHEETING

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:25.134
THE MORE EVIDENCE THERE IS. AND

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:26.870
YOU'LL SEE THAT THESE BOXES ARE

00:58:26.936 --> 00:58:28.071
GOING TO CORRESPOND WITH THE

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:29.305
SIZE OF THE PLASTIC FOR THE

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:31.341
THINK. BIG PLASTIC NOW AND THE

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.343
LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION IF YOU GO

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.178
TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE.

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:37.080
HOW MUCH EVIDENCE THERE IS

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:38.915
ABOUT A ONE HALF TO AQUATIC

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:40.950
BIOTA. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.585
EVIDENCE FROM MY GRIP THAT

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.053
MICROPLASTIC IMPACT ANIMALS

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.955
ACROSS MANY LEVELS OF

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.724
BIOLOGICAL ORGANISATION.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.592
MORAXELLA IN THOSE LOWER LEVEL

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:50.560
BECAUSE THOSE ARE FROM

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.829
LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. WE

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.397
DON'T DOES LARGE ANIMALS WITH

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:56.032
MACRO PLASTICS ON THE RIGHT

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.300
SIDE OF THE GRAPH YOU'RE SEEING

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.469
ANIMALS THAT WASHED UP WITH.

00:58:59.535 --> 00:59:00.970
LACERATIONS ARE PLASTIC IN

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:03.072
THERE GOT TO COST MORTALITY.

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.307
THANK YOU ARE THE NEXT FIGHT

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:05.875
YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS EVIDENCE

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.143
HAS INCREASED FROM TWENTY

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:10.280
THIRTEEN. TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:11.347
MORE BOXES ARE FILLED AND THE

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:19.956
SCALE OF THE BOXES. HAS CHANGED

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.190
DRAMATICALLY. HOWEVER IF YOU

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:22.292
CLICK ON THE NEXT SLIDE. YOU

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:23.960
CAN SEE THAT WE ALL THE ADMIN

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.628
THAT SOMETIMES MAKE A PLASTIC

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:27.397
DOES BECAUSE OF THE FACT. IN

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:30.133
SOME. THAT WE CAST IN OREGON

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:32.035
FOR FACT. WE MIGHT NOT GET.

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:33.803
THEY THAT WERE LOOK FOR YEAH

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.138
SEE THAT LESS STOCKS WITH MAC

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:37.607
CLASS. BUT THE THREE THE OF. IF

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:38.574
YOU GO TO THE NET IDEA CAN SEE

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:41.210
THE HAVE TO DO IT HOW. CLASS IS

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.446
IN THE IN. THE TYPE AND SHAPE

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.415
OF PLASTIC BEAR THE ANNA THAT

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:47.583
IT INTERACTS WITH BY THE

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.852
PLASTIC OR IN A STUDY HOW THEY

00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.754
GET THEIR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.289
BUT THE LAST FRIDAY WHEN I SHOW

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:55.625
YOU BEFORE IRAQ THAT IS THAT WE

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:56.793
KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.661
LOT OF QUESTIONS TO ASK IF YOU

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.196
GO TO THAT NEXT FIGHT WITH THAT

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.497
THE GRAPH AND THE PICTURES. THE

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:03.533
WORLD SHOULD BE THERE TO PAPER

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:06.202
THAT DEMONSTRATED THROUGH MODEL

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.103
THAT WITH THE EVIDENCE WE

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:08.738
CURRENTLY HAVE THERE'S ALREADY

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.907
ENOUGH PLASTIC IN SOME PARTS OF

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.308
THE OCEAN. AND SOME PARTS OF

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.776
FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS BETTER

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.912
CAUSING AN IMPACT. WE'RE SEEING

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.580
EVIDENCE OF MEASURABLE RISK ARE

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:20.049
READY AND WE EXPECT MORE IF WE

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.618
CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL. SO

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.487
TO CONCLUDE JEFF CAN'T GO GIVE

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:26.656
IT AN OVERALL SUMMARY WE KNOW

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.658
THAT LARGE PLASTIC DEBRIS CAN

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:30.493
HARM WILDLIFE THERE'S NO DOUBT.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.794
FOR MICROPLASTICS THERE'S

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:32.895
EVIDENCE THAT IT CERTAINLY

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.530
CAN'T THE WHEN AND HOW WITH A

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:36.699
LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED. BUT WE

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.201
KNOW THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:39.869
ALREADY LEADING TO MEASURABLE

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.571
RISK IN FRESHWATER AND MARINE

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.506
ECOSYSTEM. THE WHILE WE TRY TO

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.042
UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.910
OF MICROPLASTICS WE ALSO SHOULD

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.412
START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.514
REDUCE. MICROPLASTIC IN BIG

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:58.521
PLASTIC. THE MISSION THANK YOU

01:00:58.588 --> 01:00:59.055
SO MUCH. THANK VERY MUCH

01:00:59.122 --> 01:00:59.789
PROFESSOR IF YOU TO MIND BY

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:00.990
WHILE WE TO OUR LAST. IN THEM

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:04.193
OVER TO BACK FOR QUESTION.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:04.927
THANK YOU ARE LAST S FOR THE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:07.296
FIRST PANEL IS TERROR BROKE

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.365
WITH THE OCEAN WITH OSHANA. AND

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:11.100
MODERATOR WOULD YOU MIND

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:14.337
CONNECTING TERROR BROKE. AT

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:18.307
INTERIOR LINE IS OPEN. THANK

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:21.077
YOU AND I CAN'T SEE MY POWER

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:24.047
POINT BUT- WILL ALSO- TRUCK BUT

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.982
IT'S UP AND- HAVE PLAYED THE

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:27.617
DANCE THAT BY WORK THROUGH MY

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:29.352
PRESENTATION YES WE CAN SAY IT

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:31.954
AGAIN LEAVING IS TERRA. OKAY

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.090
GREAT- THE VIDEO THE LITTLE THE

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.525
LANE SO I APOLOGIZE BUT I'M NOT

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:37.527
ABLE TO BE THERE IN PERSON OR

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:40.396
OR VIA VIDEO- BUT THANK YOU FOR

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.398
INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.534
TODAY- I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.502
MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:47.937
MARINE ENVIRONMENT YOU'VE

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.639
YOU'VE HEARD MUCH OF THAT-

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:52.075
BEFORE- AS THE CHAIR SAID IN

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.309
THE BEGINNING MANY FOLKS ARE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.944
NOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH THESE

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.214
ISSUES AND- YOU HEARD- FROM

01:01:58.281 --> 01:01:59.215
FROM OUR PREVIOUS WITNESSES

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.983
WHILE SO HOPEFULLY I CAN MOVE

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:05.354
QUICKLY COULD ACTUALLY. GET GET

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:06.756
THE QUEUE IN A- SO. ONE THING I

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.957
ALL LIKE THE ABOUT IN THE WHERE

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:11.894
HAS. THE WE ARE A PLAN AND-

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.596
OCEANS COVER MORE. THAT PERCENT

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.531
OF OUR OR THIRD FAT. AND ARE

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:16.899
REALLY CRITICAL TO LIFE ON OUR

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.768
PLANET BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE 50%

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:20.903
OF THE EARTH OXIGEN. AND

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.972
DESPITE THE OCEAN IMPORTANT TO

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.774
LIFE ON EARTH. THEY ARE

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:26.142
LITERALLY STARTING TO CHOKE ON

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:28.311
PLASTIC AND AS ONE FINDS THAT

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.146
RECENTLY PUT IT. THE OCEANS ARE

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:33.316
PUTTING PLASTIC BACK AT US WITH

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:33.916
EVERYWHERE. SO OUR ENVIRONMENT

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.618
AS YOU'VE HEARD HAS BEING

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.019
INUNDATED WITH THE MATERIAL

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.788
THAT DOESN'T BIODEGRADE IT

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.056
BUILDS UP IN OUR ENVIRONMENT

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.325
AND THREATENS MARINE ANIMALS AS

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.127
WELL AS HUMAN. AND THE

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.695
VERSATILITY AND DURABILITY OF

01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:47.830
PLASTIC IS WHAT REALLY BECAUSE

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:49.332
IT'S BECOME SO PREVALENT AND

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:51.200
PERSISTENT IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:53.369
AND WHILE WE FOCUS ON OCEAN

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.371
PLASTIC HAVE BEEN FOUND AROUND

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.240
THE GLOBE IN FRESHWATER LAKES

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:59.075
AND MELTING ARCTIC SEA ICE AND

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.043
RAIN COLLECTED IN THE MOUNTAINS

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.411
AND IN THE AIR ABOUT THE FRENCH

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.313
PEYRONIE'S- SO WE ARE REALLY

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.883
SEEING CLASSIC THROUGHOUT OUR-

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:10.453
OUR CLUB. AND I FIGHT THE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.755
ALBATROSS FOR FLORIDA THE-

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.824
POSTER CHILD FOR OCEAN PLASTIC

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.425
POLLUTION AND THAT'S BECAUSE

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.294
THEY TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:21.230
ACROSS THE OCEAN TO FEED AT B.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.532
AND THEIR PREFERRED PREFERRED

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:24.800
SHOULD IT WHAT AND WHICH TEND

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:25.902
TO ATTACH THEMSELVES THE

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.503
FLOATING PIECES OF PLASTIC. AND

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.971
PLASTIC BOTTLE VERY OFTEN

01:03:29.038 --> 01:03:30.806
BRIGHTLY COLORED AND SO AT THE

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.675
TRACTOR TO AN ANIMAL FLYING

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.311
ABOVE A VERY FAST OCEAN. AN

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:36.946
ADULT ALL THE TRAPS WELL THEN

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:39.048
WHO IS THAT AND FEED THEM TO

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.716
THEIR CHECK TO BELIZE WILL PULL

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.351
UP THE CLASSIC MAKING THEM FEEL

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.187
FALL. EVEN THOUGH THEY LACK ANY

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.022
REAL NOURISHMENT AND I'M SURE

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:47.089
MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THE

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:50.293
PICTURES OF ALBATROS CHECK-

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.261
WITH THEIR BELLY FULL PACKED-

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.063
PLASTICS THAT WORK THAT HAS

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.531
START TO THAT. BUT ALL THE

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:57.099
TRUCKS ARE FAR FROM THE ONLY

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.401
BIRD SPECIES THREATENED BY

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:01.537
PLASTIC. 90% OF THE BIRD

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.606
SPECIES HAVE CONSUMED PLASTIC

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.309
THE RESULT OF WHICH- CAN BE

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:13.449
FATAL. OUR NEXT BY IT'S- WHEN

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.984
EXPERT ON OF THE MATH MARK AND

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.719
THEN I. FIFTIES IT WAS REALLY

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:19.121
FELLOW FROM LIFE MARKET. AND

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.856
TODAY AS WE KNOW DRINK OUR

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.858
COFFEE OUT OF PLASTIC CUPS WITH

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.194
THE FACT THAT LIDS AND- STRAWS.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.963
AND OUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.798
AND CLEANING SUPPLIES ARE ALL

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:30.733
PACKED. IT REALLY MAKES OUR

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.535
LIFE EASIER AND FOR PRETTY

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.937
CHEAP. AND AS YOU AS YOU HEARD

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.038
SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.107
PROCESS- PRESENTATIONS AN

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.508
ESTIMATED EIGHT MILLION METRIC

TONS ENTERED THE MARINE

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.745
ENVIRONMENT LANDAY SOURCES

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.547
EVERY YEAR. AND THAT'S

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:45.915
EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT SEVENTEEN

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.283
POINT SIX BILLION POUNDS OF

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.518
PLASTIC. AND ONCE THEY GET

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.120
THERE IT DOESN'T TEND TO GO

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:53.089
AWAY. AND EVERY YEAR THE OCEAN

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:57.860
CONSERVANCY ORGANIZES AN ERROR.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:04:59.562
THE WORLD COLLECT AND RECORD

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.031
DECLINE ALONG OUR CLOTHES. AND

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.232
THE DATA COMPILED INTO AN

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:05.167
ANNUAL REPORT REVEALING THE

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.869
MOST COMMONLY COLLECTED ITEMS.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.404
I ONE OF THE BIGGEST OFFENDERS

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.139
THAT WE SEE ARE SINGLE USE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.875
PLASTICS PARTICULARLY FOOD

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.710
WHERE AND PACKAGING. MOORLACH

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:19.315
BUT LACKS I THINK. AN ESTIMATED

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:20.616
SEVEN HUNDRED WEARING JEANS AND

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:22.051
QUITTING MANY ENDANGERED

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:24.086
SPECIES ARE AFFECTED BY MARINE

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:26.489
PLASTIC POLLUTION EVEN THOUGH

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:28.190
PLANTS AND AS YOU HEARD TINY

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.226
MARINE ORGANISMS THAT FORM THE

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.427
BASE OF THE OCEAN FOOD CHAIN

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.062
ARE EATING PLASTIC WHICH THAN

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.797
CAN ACCUMULATE AND LARGER OCEAN

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:37.900
PREDATORS LIKE FISH THAT WE EAT.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:40.202
AND THAT'S BECAUSE PLASTIC LOOK

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:41.304
LIKE THOSE OF FOR EXAMPLE

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.439
PICTURES PLASTIC BACK IN

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:45.908

EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY AND

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.688
INVESTIGATED. AND I'M SURE MANY

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.189
HAD SEEN THE VIDEO THAT HURDLE

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.891
WHAT THAT STRAW LOGINIS KNOWS

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.359
THAT WENT VIRAL A COUPLE YEARS

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.728
AGO AND RELEASED BIRDS- PUSH

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:10.666
BACK ON THE USE OF. MILLION

WHICH- IT'S FOR PACKAGING.

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.842
WHICH IS OFTEN USED ONCE AND

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.111
THROWN AWAY. AND PLASTIC

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:56.846
PRODUCTION ISN'T BUYING NOW IN

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:58.447

FOURTEEN. AND ALMOST ALL

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.558
PLASTICS ARE MADE FROM POP

BEING PURCHASE. MPK BOTTLED ARE

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:03.412
COMMONLY USED AS WE NOW BURKE

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.647
OFFERING SOME WATER BUT CAN

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:07.016
ALSO BE USED IN OTHER HOUSEHOLD

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:09.218
OR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.587

HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION OF THESE

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.723
BOTTLES WERE SOLD IN TWENTY

EIGHTEEN ALONG WHICH IS ALMOST

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:19.695
A MILLION EVERY MINUTE. AND IT

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.331
FIFTY ONE PERCENT- THEN WHAT

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.466
WITH THE OLD AND TWO THOUSAND

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:24.934
NINE. WHAT THAT'S WONDERFUL

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.302
MINUTE YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.971
DUMP TRUCK REALLY- IS LONG GONE

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:33.909

SHALL THAT WHAT A PILE FACT

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:41.984
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT WAS

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.986
COLLECTED OVER A LONGER PERIOD

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.721

ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILE HI.

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:15.918
NECKLINE. SO THAT EIGHT MILLION

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.286
METRIC TONS THAT WE TALKED

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.454
ABOUT GOING INTO THE OCEAN

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:20.256
ANNUALLY THAT IS ABOUT THE

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.124
EQUIVALENT OF A DUMP TRUCK LOAD

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.726
EVERY MINUTE AND THE

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.327
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IS THAT

01:09:25.394 --> 01:09:27.530
THIS WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:30.032
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND I

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.267
THINK WE JUST HEARD WE CAN

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.801
UPDATED DATA FROM OUR LAST

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:33.836
PRESENTER THAT WE MIGHT ALREADY

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.771
BE HERE AND SO THE AMOUNT OF

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.473
PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN IS REALLY

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.441
PROJECTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY

01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:43.846
INCREASE- IF WE CONTINUE ON THECURRENT COURSE. AND THE IMPACT

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:44.980
THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT WHILE

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.449
THEY COULD REALLY BEAT THE

01:09:47.516 --> 01:09:50.419
BACKGROUND. NEXT SLIDE. BUT

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.321
THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS- THE

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.290
AMOUNT OF COUNTRYWIDE PLASTIC

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.891
LEGISLATION HAS REALLY

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:58.627
INCREASED RAPIDLY IN REPAIRS AS

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.195
AWARENESS OF PLASTIC POLLUTION

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.498
BECOMES MORE WIDESPREAD- THERE

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:04.934
BEEN POLICIES- PUT FORWARD

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.602
AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING IN

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.938
CALIFORNIA- SO THERE IS SOME

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:11.140
GOOD NEWS AND A REAL

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:12.608
OPPORTUNITY THERE AND THAT'S

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.310
WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY I

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:18.347
THINK IT'S THE THINK ABOUT-

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.381
REAL POLLUTION. PROBLEM NEXT

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:22.885
SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE REALLY NEED

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:24.753
TO DECIDE WHAT FUTURE WE WANT

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.055
FOR OUR OCEANS AND FOR

01:10:26.121 --> 01:10:28.123
OURSELVES AND THIS ISN'T JUST

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:30.059
ABOUT THE AMOUNT WE CAN REDUCE

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.794
FROM TODAY'S PRODUCTION LEVELS

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.362
THAT TALKED ABOUT PREVENTING

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:35.164
THE DOUBLING OF THE AMOUNT JUST

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.066
IN THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES SO

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.435
WE NEED TO- FIRST OF ALL REDUCE

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.869
THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE PRODUCING

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:41.937
AND THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.906
INTO THE OCEAN TO MAKE SURE

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.874
THAT- WE CAN HAVE A VIBRANT

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.242
BEAUTIFUL OCEAN THAT THE

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:49.278
FUTURE- AND WITH THAT I THINK

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.045
WE'RE AT THE END OF THIS

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:53.549
SECTION. SO WE'LL BE HAPPY TO

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:54.883

SOBERING. SO IF US I HAVE A

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.398
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION ASSUMING

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.133
THAT WE STOPPED ALL PLASTIC

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.468
POLLUTION GOING INTO THE OCEANS

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:13.836
TODAY LET'S SAY WE COULD JUST

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:15.571
NOT WAVE A MAGIC WAND THAT I

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.539
WISHED I HAD. HOW WE CAN STOP

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.108
THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC AND

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:19.975
STOP IT FROM GOING IN THE

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.177
OCEANS. HOW DO WE CLEAN UP THE

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.545
TRASH THAT'S ALREADY IN THERE

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.180
WHAT IT WILL IS THERE A WAY TO

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.849
ROLL BACK THOSE IMPACTS IS IT

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:27.650
SOMETHING THAT WILL DISSIPATE

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.251
OVER TIME OR IS THAT DAMAGE

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:32.221
JUST DONE UNTIL WE COME UP WITH

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:35.524
SOME BRAND NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:36.892
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:38.527
QUESTION THAT ONE I THINK MANY

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.729
ARE THINKING ABOUT. I DON'T

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.765
HAVE A PERFECT ANSWER ONE THING

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:46.435
THAT WE DO WELL IS AS I SAID IN

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.337
THE BEGINNING THE OCEANS DO YOU.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:51.173
STING PLASTIC BACKED OUT. SO

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.375
MUCH OF THAT IS SO FINE LITTLE

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:56.045
CLASSICS THAT IT IS A REALLY

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:57.846
NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP AND

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.082
THEN BE. WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.850
OTHER WAYS TO CLEAN UP WHILE IN

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.752
THE OCEAN I'M SURE MANY MANY

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:04.987
HAVE HEARD OF THE GREAT OCEAN

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:07.489
CLEANUP PROJECT WHICH NOT A LOT

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:09.291
OF- FUNDING TO LOOK AT

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.325
POTENTIALLY CLEANING UP

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:13.228
CLASSICAL ABOUT ME OCEAN- BUT

WE STOP ALL CLASSIC TODAY THE

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:17.800
CLEAN UP BY THE THINGS IS

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.802
SOMETHING THAT. WE HAVE NOT WE

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:21.103

WOULD IT'S A REALLY GOOD

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.774
QUESTION RIGHT MOST OF THE

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:41.109
INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:44.012
IS ABOUT AND HOW MICROPLASTICS

01:14:44.079 --> 01:14:45.414
OR PLASTIC POLLUTION IN GENERAL

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.316
IMPACT WILDLIFE BUT AS YOU KNOW

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.917
IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A BILL

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:50.652
THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:51.954
TO DEFINE MICROPLASTICS

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.622
RELEVANT YOU DRINKING WATER

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.023
EVENTUALLY WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.592
METHOD TO QUANTIFY IT IN

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.627
DRINKING WATER WHICH MEANS WE

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.295
HAVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT TOO

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:01.864
MUCH THOUGH THAT WHAT WE-

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:03.532
MEASURE THAT AMOUNT WE CAN SAY

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:05.167
WHETHER OR NOT IT MEANS WE NEED

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:06.335
TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THE

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:08.036
AMOUNT OF DRINKING WATER SO

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:08.904
THERE'S A WORKING GROUP RIGHT

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.974
NOW. I IN CALIFORNIA OF EXPERTS

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.075
FROM AROUND THE WORLD YOU

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:15.210
COMING TOGETHER TO SURVEY THE

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:16.411
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE THERE

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.279
IS SOME RESEARCH ON

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.814
MICROPLASTICSIN HUMAN HEALTH

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.449
BUT IT'S LIMITED I TRY TO COME

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:21.583
UP WITH THOSE NUMBERS SO YOUR

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.784
QUESTION IS GOOD AND I WOULD

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:27.456
SAY THAT IN ABOUT FIVE OR. SIX

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:28.023
MONTHS WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.059
ANSWER IT. OKAY THANK YOU- I

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.394
HAVEN'T ANOTHER QUESTION THIS

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.863
IS FOR FRANKLY FOR ANYBODY HERE

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.365
BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE VERY

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:39.835
FIRST- SLIDE FROM THE ELADIO

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.904
WHICH WAS TALKED ABOUT HOW. THE

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.473
AMOUNT OF PLASTIC- WASTE OUR

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.807
LANDFILLS AND IN GENERAL HAS

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.342
INCREASING BECAUSE MOST THE

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:49.444
PUBLIC THINKS WE RECYCLE IT

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:51.280
IT'S ALL GOOD JUST THERE THAT

01:15:51.346 --> 01:15:53.148
WAS GOING FOR A WALK IN THEIR

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:54.616
KIDS. HEY PROTECT THE

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.652
REFILLABLE WATER BOTTLES NOT

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.320
NOT THOSE ARE THE ONES IS

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.821
AVAILABLE TO RECYCLE THAT'S

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.990
FINE IT'S ALL GOOD AND- WE

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.425
THINK THAT. THAT'S WHY HAVE THE

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.327
BIG BAND BUT IT DOES ALWAYS-

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:06.495
WORK THAT WAY AND I AND I LIKE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:07.396
WITH THE FIRST SPEAKER TALKED

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:08.630
ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE HIGH

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.432
COST OF LOW PRICES DOLLAR

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.234
STORES EVERYTHING IS. PLASTIC

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.669
AND DISPOSABLE AND IT'S SUPER

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:14.970
CHEAP BUT PEOPLE THINK I'LL

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.972
THROW IT IN THE BLUE BAND. IT'S

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.374
ALL GOING TO BE- ALL GONNA BE

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:23.578
RECYCLED SO. YOU KNOW IT WHAT

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.280
DO WE NEED TO DO TO. FROM THE

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.615
PUBLIC TO HAVE A BETTER

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.383
UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.552
STUFF IS NOT. RECYCLE I THINK

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.054
THAT HISTORICALLY WE JUST

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.622
THINK. THAT BLUE BANDS GONNA

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.690
SOLVE ALL OF OUR WELLS PUT

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.291
EVERYTHING IN THAT LOOP AND

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.394
EVERYTHING BE RECYCLED SO- IS

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:39.795
IT JUST A LACK OF

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.764
UNDERSTANDING. FROM FROM FROM

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.299
THAT POLICY MAKERS AND FOR THE

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:46.134
PUBLIC AS FAR AS WHAT IS.

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:47.836
RECYCLABLE THAT THAT HINDERS

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.738
OUR ABILITY TO BRING ABOUT.

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:50.639
CHANGE MAYBE IT ISN'T A

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:52.240
QUESTION IS THE STATEMENT BUT-

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:55.544
I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW A BIG

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.144
ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:58.647
IN THIS IN THE SPACE. IF

01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:01.550
ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO- SAY

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:02.150
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T THAT

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:07.823
WE CAN FIND. SO ANYBODY WANTS

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.691
TO COMMENT ON THAT- FEEL FREE

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:10.993
IF NOT WE CAN JUST GO TO THE

01:17:11.059 --> 01:17:13.128
NEXT QUESTION I'M TOLD THAT-

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.031
TERROR PROFITS BACK ON AS WELL.

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:20.635
OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOOD- I

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:21.937
GUESS I'LL JUST ASK A FEW

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:24.139
QUESTIONS- FOR I KNOW THAT

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:27.309
PROFESSOR. ROTHMAN IS THERE MY

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:29.711
QUESTION IS WHAT WE KNOW

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:31.179
WHETHER WE KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:32.981
EFFECT OF THE MICRO PLASTICS ON

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.950
HUMAN HEALTH AND I'VE READ THAT

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:37.386
THERE IS SOME LINK PERHAPS TO

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.553
PLASTIC BEING AN ENDOCRINE

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.057
DISRUPTOR AND POSSIBLE- IMPACTS

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.358
TO HUMAN HEALTH WITH ENDOCRINE

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:44.893
DISRUPTION BUT I'M WONDERING

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.095
HOW MUCH WE ACTUALLY KNOW. HOW

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:49.631
MUCH WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.066
THAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE SHOULD

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.334
HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:55.003
PLASTICS AND THEIR IMPACT ON

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:58.040
HUMAN HEALTH. YEAH I WOULD SAY

01:17:58.106 --> 01:18:00.008
THAT WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IS

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.576
WE KNOW WE'RE EXPOSED SO

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.078
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT WE DRINK

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.647
MICROPLASTICS IN WATER. WE EAT

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.549
IT WITH OURS THE FOOD AND IT'S

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.985
INVEST SO WE ALSO BEAT IT WHEN

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.486
IT LANDS ON THE FOOD THAT WE'RE

01:18:11.553 --> 01:18:13.488
EATING OR POTENTIALLY IN HELL

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.357
IT. AYE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.591
UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW IS THAT

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:18.193
THE STATE OF IT IN THE BODY WE

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.828
KNOW THAT IT CAN TRANSFER FROM

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:22.264
THE GUIDE INTO. THE CIRCULATORY

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.865
SYSTEM AND THEN INTO THE LIVER

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:24.966
AND WE SEE IT SOMETIMES THE

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:27.269
MUSCLE TISSUE OF FISH. AT THAT

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.470
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:30.072
SMALLER THE PLASTIC IS YOU HAVE

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:34.176
THIS SYSTEMIC AVAILABILITY. IN

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.011
THE BODY- WE KNOW MORE. HOW

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.546
THAT IMPACTS FISH AND OTHER

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:38.880
ORGANISMS THAN WE DO FOR

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.749
HUMANS. PART OF THAT REASON IS

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.884
WE CAN'T EXPERIMENT WITH HUMAN-

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.086
BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.987
ON MICE THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.689
THESE MICROPLASTICS CAN LEAD TO

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.758
INFLAMMATION. THAT THEY CAN

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:52.027
CHANGE AND GREEN EXPRESSIONS

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.695
THAT YOU ASK IF THEY CAN IN

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:54.496
INTERACT WITH THE ENDOCRINE

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.499
SYSTEM. IN HUMANS THAT HAPPENED

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.301
AND LOOK AT IT KIND IT'S

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:01.403
MOSTLY. I JEAN EXPO THAT ARE

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.604
RELEVANT TO THE NEEDS SYSTEM

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:05.107
FUNCTION. BUT IN FISH WE HAVE

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:07.275
BEEN. EVIDENCE OF ENDOCRINE

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:09.778
DISRUPTION RELEVANT Q. CHANGES

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.046
IN GENE EXPRESSION THAT ARE

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.115
RELEVANT TO HOW MANY EGGS CAN

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:16.351
LAY AND ALSO. I CHANGES IN THAT

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.620
GOMEZ AT EMAIL FISH EXPECTING

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.789
FEMININE CHARACTERISTICS SO.

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.624
THEY CAN INTERACT WITH A

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:23.658
DIFFERENT SYSTEM HOW MUCH THEY

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.994
DO IN HUMANS OUR STILL IS TO

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:33.101
HAVE A BIT LEARN. THANK YOU- BY

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:35.570
OTHER IS BESIDES IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.606
WE NEED TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.541
THE EFFECT OF- OF MICROPLASTICS

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.809
IN HUMAN HEALTH AND WE ALSO

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.244
TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.044
CERTAINLY DO A LOT MORE

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.413
RESEARCH ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.449
THE OR REMOVE THE PLASTICS THAT

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.050
ARE CURRENTLY IN THE OCEAN IF

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:50.685
OR ANY OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:52.654
THAT YOU WISH WE WERE-

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.289
INVESTING MORE AND I MEAN WHAT

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.390
ELSE WHAT ARE THE OTHER BIG

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.759
UNKNOWNS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:19:57.826 --> 01:20:00.595
THAT WE SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.664
I THINK THE THING THAT THAT I

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.399
WOULD STAY IT RUNS. AND THIS

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.134
ISN'T ABOUT. IT ISN'T ABOUT THE

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.736
IMPACT BUT I THINK IT'S ONE OF

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.538
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. IN

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:10.605
ORDER KIDS THINK ABOUT THE MOST

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:12.340
THAT. MISSION AFFECTED WAY TO

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.409
ACT. IF THEY THINK WE NEED

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.311
LOCAL MONETARY SO I WAS

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:17.445
INVOLVED IN A STUDY IN SAN

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:19.414
FRANCISCO BAY. LOOKING AT MICRO

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.916
PLASTICS AND WE LEARNED A LOT

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.851
ABOUT ROAD RUNOFF THAT. WE

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:23.985
THOUGHT WHAT THE TIRE THAT'S

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:26.321
COMING IN STORMWATER. ABOUT THE

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:27.055
MICROFIBERS WITH WATER

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:28.690
TREATMENT PLANTS WE KNOW THAT'S

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.125
IMPORTANT PATH WHERE SPORTS

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:32.627
INDICATED. I THINK IF WE START

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:34.596
LOCAL MONITORING PROGRAMS WE

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.498
CAN UNDERSTAND THE SOURCES.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.700
WHICH CAN HELP FORCE REDUCTION

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:40.068
AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE WE

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.836
NEED TO KEEP RESEARCHING. THE

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:43.371
IMPACT ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:45.574
HEALTH BUT THAT ON GOING. AND I

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.008
THINK UNDERSTANDING THE COURSES

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:52.914
CAN HELP BACK AND. START THE

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:53.682
MITIGATION PROCESS. THANK YOU I

01:20:53.748 --> 01:20:54.983
MEAN I'M TO. MS LEON GROW. WHO

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:55.517
I THINK TO AN ONE OF THE

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:56.885
PREVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WAS

01:20:56.952 --> 01:21:01.823
ASKED. ARE YOU THERE. YES I'M

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.192
HERE- I WANTED TO ANSWER

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.460
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTHY'S

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.996
QUESTION ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHAT

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.931
CAN WE DO ABOUT THE FACT THAT A

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.233
LOT OF RECYCLING AND SUB BEING

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:13.268
LANDFILLED. AND I THINK IT WAS

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.003
THE REASON WE ARE HERE WAS

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:17.205
BECAUSE OF AN INTENTIONAL

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:18.840
CAMPAIGN BY THE INDUSTRY.

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:20.809
PUTTING THE BURDEN BACK ON OFF

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.544
THE CONSUMERS AND IT JUST FEELS

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.612
GOOD TO PUT STUFF IN THE

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.413
RECYCLING BIN I EVEN SEE MORE

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.848
RECYCLING BINS I SEE TWO OR

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:28.717
EVEN THREE. RECYCLING BINS WHEN

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:30.685
I GO FOR A WALK- AND PEOPLE

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:31.920
JUST THINK YOU KNOW JUST BEFORE

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.722
CARPORT THERE I JUST PUT MORE

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:34.789
CLASSICS THERE AND EVERYTHING'S

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.258
GOING TO YOU KNOW GO AND GET

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.859
RECYCLED. EVEN THOUGH THAT

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:39.327
MIGHT NOT BE TRUE UNTIL I THINK

01:21:39.394 --> 01:21:42.063
THE ONLY WAY TO COMBAT THAT IS.

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:44.899
A CAMPAIGN TO INFORM THE PUBLIC

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.535
THIS IS THE REALITY OF THINGS-

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.437
THERE'S ALSO ALSO THE FACT THAT

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:50.672
A LOT MORE PEOPLE MIGHT BE

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.608
ORDERING STUFF ONLINE- SO THAT

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:54.442
YOU KNOW THEY JUST THINK WE'LL

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:58.313
ALL JUST RECYCLE. THAT INSTEAD

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.248
OF- YEAH. PURCHASING WITH MY

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:01.750
AND MORE FOR CONSCIENCE AND HOW.

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.685
DO WE IMPLEMENT. POLICIES THAT

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.553
ARE NOT GOING TO AFFECT. HOW

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.222
PEOPLE BUY IT AND OTHER

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:08.990
BEHAVIOR SO AGAIN I THINK IT

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:11.960
JUST GOES TO. SHOW THAT- YOU

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:15.230
KNOW. COMMUNICATIONS FROM OUR

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:16.598
THE INDUSTRY ARE WORKING WELL

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.466
AND PUTTING YOU KNOW THINGS ON

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.568
ON A ON A BLOOP AND- JUST MAKES

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.704
PEOPLE FEEL GOOD AND- AND

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.105
THAT'S THE END OF IT BUT HE'S

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:25.440
CLEARLY NOT THE SOLUTION AND

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.909
THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THE POINT-

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:28.710
AND TIMES THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.779
AND HE'S- FROM. GOING TO GET

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.647
WORSE IF WE DON'T ACT NOW I

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:33.915
HAVE A QUESTION I HAVE A

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:34.716
QUESTION FOR YOU WHY YOU'RE

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.152
HERE. WHEN WE TRY TO TALK TO

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.254
INDUSTRY OR PASSED BILLS OR

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.890
LEGISLATION. CURBING THE USE OF

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:44.993
PLASTIC OR MANDATING MORE

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.262
RECYCLED CONTENT INTO. PRODUCTS

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.730
THAT ARE BEING PRODUCED THE

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.865
INDUSTRY USUALLY RESPONDS BY

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.200
COMING BACK AND SAYING WELL IF

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:54.102
WE DO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE OUR

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.136
PRODUCTS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:56.037
AND THAT'S GONNA HURT LOW

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:56.938
INCOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.807
WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD. TO

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.041
PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS ANYMORE

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:03.411
AND I'M WONDERING HOW YOU WOULD

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:08.683
ANSWER. THAT ARGUMENT. WELL I

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.218
MEAN THERE'S SOME INDUSTRY THAT

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:11.353
UNDOUBTEDLY WILL HAVE TO GO

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:13.822
AWAY JUST BECAUSE THE- BUSINESS

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:15.223
MODEL THAT THEY HAVE. THE

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:18.093
ANSWER TO OUR- POLLUTION

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.728
ESPECIALLY PLUS A SINGLE USE

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:22.430
PLASTIC POLLUTION. IS TO CUT IT

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:25.400
AT THE SOURCE. AND WE KNOW THAT

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.000
THE PLASTIC INDUSTRIES HIGHLY

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:29.137
AUTOMATED. SO WHAT WE NEED TO

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:31.106
DO IS JUST REALLY. GO BACK TO

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.774
REUSABLE AND THAT'S A NEW TYPE

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.342
OF ECONOMY AN ECONOMY THAT WE

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:35.744
NEED TO BE PROMOTING.

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:38.246
SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY- I GREW UP

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.749
IN MEXICO CITY WHERE EVERYTHING

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.217
PRETTY MUCH- ESPECIALLY

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:44.719
BEVERAGES WHERE. A REUSABLE AND

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.454
WE JUST STARTED ANYTHING THEY-

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:48.857
WILL REFILL IT. SO WE KNOW THAT

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.158
IT'S POSSIBLE IF THE ONE OF THE

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:52.127
BIGGEST. CITIES IN THE WORLD

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:54.095
CAN DO IT. I KNOW CALIFORNIA

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:56.564
CAN DO IT. SO IT'S JUST A

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:58.133
DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.635
BUSINESS. AND WE JUST NEED TO

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:01.903
CHANGE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.371
DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND WE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.673
KNOW THAT PEOPLE GETTING HURT

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.475
FROM EXTRACTION. TO THE WAY

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:08.610
THAT WE'RE PRODUCING THE

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.577
MATERIALS OF THE WAY WE'RE

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.012
CONSUMING WE KNOW LOW INCOME

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.580
PEOPLE GETTING HURT WITH

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:14.015
DIFFERENT DISEASES CANCER AND

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:17.051
EVEN DEATH. SO THAT WOULD BE MY

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:20.121
ANSWER. GREAT THANK YOU. I

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.223
WOULD ASK MY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:26.394
IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:28.963
GOVERNMENT'S GARCIA. THIS THANK

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:32.801
YOU I. WE ARGUED TALKED US

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:34.035
ABOUT HOW MICROPLASTICS ARE

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:35.837
FOUND IN OUR SEAFOOD AND IN OUR

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.972
WATER CAN YOU ELABORATE ON

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:39.007
OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WERE

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.809
CONSUMING THAT ALSO ARE ALSO

01:24:40.875 --> 01:24:43.878
CONTAMINATED WITH MICROPLASTICS

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:44.446
THE PROBLEM MUCH WETTER THAN

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:52.287
TO. RECEIVE FOOD. WELL I CAN

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:53.154
ANSWER THE QUESTION COMES UP I

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.689
MEAN OR EVEN FREEZING

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.024
MICROPLASTICS AT THIS POINT

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.026
BECAUSE OF THE PREVALENCE. OF

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.994
IS EVEN IN THE RAIN IT'S

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:01.963
EVERYWHERE AT THIS POINT SO AND

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.198
WE KNOW EVEN IN THE FISH IS NOT

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:05.033
JUST IN THEIR GUTS EVEN UNDER

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:07.869
SKIN. SO WE KNOW WE'RE-

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.238
CONSUMING MAP OF MICROPLASTICS

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:10.805
IN IN MORE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.541
EVEN THINK OFF- AND IT'S JUST

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.510
GOING TO KEEP. GROWING THE

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:16.211
PROBLEM IS GOING TO KEEP

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.012
GROWING ON UNLESS WE TAKE

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.547
ACTION AND WE TAKE IT SWIFTLY.

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.682
DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF ACTUAL

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.717
LIKE I BELIEVE YOU REALLY START

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:23.618
THAT AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.153
COULD RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.788
THIS PROBLEM I DO BELIEVE. SO

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:28.289
HE'S WILL BACK TO ELEMENTARY

01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:29.991
CAMPAIGN- EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.493
THAT WE HAD WHEN I WAS GROWING

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:37.165
UP THE REDUCE. REUSE RECYCLE. I

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:37.799
RECYCLE BIN OUR LAST OPTION. I

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.468
THEIR- BOB BIG ARE WE ARE WE

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:41.970
TRY. SINCE I'M MORE SYSTEMIC

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:42.570
WAY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.706
CASE. TO THE PUBLIC OF YOU KNOW

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.508
WHAT ELSE WE FIND IT IN AT WHAT

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:47.942
LEVELS IF I NEEDED TO BE ON.

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.544
THESE TWO ITEMS I BELIEVE THAT

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.812
IT'S MUCH WIDER THAN AND

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:51.846
JUSTICE BUT DO WE HAVE SOME

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.115
SORT OF. ACTUAL DATABASE GOING

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.216
IN THE SAME THING THAT ARE

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.217
POLLUTION THAT WE HAVE A

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:59.521
METRIC. IN OUR POLLUTION

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:03.791
TRACKERS OUT THERE. I MEAN WE

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:05.860
HAVE LIKE I PERCENT- THE

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:06.895
CALIBER SCREEN THAT WE KNOW

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.263
THAT- POLLUTION IS HURTING OUR

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:10.164
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE. THE OIL

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.766
WELLS ARE CONNECTED TO PLASTIC

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:12.333
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.769
GETTING THE PLASTIC. AND I MEAN

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.138
WE CAN DO A STUDY IN TERMS OF

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.873
THE LIFE CYCLE HOW HOW MANY

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.708
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT BY. THE

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.911
PLASTICS ECONOMY. AND HOW MUCH

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.612
WE CAN SAVE. NOT ONLY BY

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:27.015
HOLDING OUT THE WASTE BUT ALSO-

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:28.683
HOW MUCH MONEY WE CAN SAVE IN

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.552
TERMS OF HEALTH SAVINGS. FOR

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:33.655
ALL THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:35.056
SICK RIGHT NOW FROM THE CYCLE.

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.090
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE IN THE

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.927
CALAVERAS SCREENER IS THERE A

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:39.527
METRIC FOR MICROPLASTICS RIGHT

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:46.968
NOW. AND. SHOULD BE ALSO THE

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.736
CONVERSE SCREEN THERE'S NO

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:50.638
OVERLAY- IN TERMS OF LIKE WHERE

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.807
ALL THE OIL WELL FIRE I DID

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:55.410
THAT MYSELF BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:56.010
SOMETHING THAT THE CONGRESSMAN

01:26:56.077 --> 01:27:04.085
TO HAVE. THERE'S BEEN READING

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:07.822
ABOUT HOW- OIL COMPANIES ARE

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:08.923
INVESTING MORE INTO PETROL

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.792
CHEMICALS THAT ARE MOVING MORE

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:11.259
THEIR BUSINESS IN THAT

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.795
DIRECTION AS- MAYBE OTHER.

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:14.829
TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF OIL

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.564
CONSUMPTION HAS HAS BEEN GOING

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:20.001
DOWN. AND THEY'VE WE'VE SEEN.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.069
THAT DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:23.271
INVESTED IN SELLING AS THE IDEA

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.540

PUTTING THINGS INTO THE BLUE

ACTUALLY TRYING TO INVEST IN

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:38.620

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.892
BACKGROUND ABOUT OUR OFFICE.

OUR OFFICE WAS FORMED SEVERAL

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.361
YEARS AGO BY THE COUNTY BOARD

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:28.796
OF SUPERVISORS WITH OUR MAIN

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.231
CHARGE BEING TO CREATE THE

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:32.533
PLAN WHICH WE'RE PROUD TO SAY

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.469
WAS ADOPTED. LAST YEAR BY OUR

BOARD- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:42.844
GREAT THE GOAL FOR THE PLAN WAS

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.345
TO OUTLINE AN AMBITIOUS A

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.646
COMPREHENSIVE AND REGIONAL

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.014
VISION FOR SUSTAINABILITY FOR

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:48.316
THE COUNTY WHICH IS CAPTURED IN

01:29:48.382 --> 01:29:50.084
THE PLANTS TWELVE HIGH LEVEL

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.386
CROSS SECTORAL GOALS WHICH YOU

SLIDE PLEASE- I WILL DEFINITELY

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:57.225
NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE BUT

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.626
WHAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS

01:29:58.693 --> 01:29:59.360
THAT AS WE WENT THROUGH THE

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:00.995
PROCESS OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.363

ROSE UP TO THE TOP AS KEY

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.501
PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNTY TO

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.236
ADDRESS. SO THAT IS WHY WE

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:09.470
ENDED UP WITH THE GOLD WHICH IS

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:10.738

RESOURCES. IN ADDITION THOUGH I

01:30:20.481 --> 01:30:21.516
ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.584
ANOTHER GOAL WHICH IS MAYBE THE

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:24.152
ONE THAT'S CAPTURED THE MOST

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:26.154
ATTENTION FROM OUR PLAN- IS THE

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.588

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:31.826
CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR THE

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:34.028
COUNTY. BY TWENTY FIFTY. IN

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:34.996
LINE WITH THE STATE GOALS OF

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:35.997
COURSE AS WELL AS OUR BOARD

01:30:36.063 --> 01:30:37.465
STATED COMMITMENT TO THE PARIS

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:39.367
CLIMATE AGREEMENT. WE SEE

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.668
TACKLING OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.103
CHALLENGES IN PARTICULAR

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.671
ADDRESSING SINGLE USE PLASTICS

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:44.672
AS KEY TO ACHIEVING THESE

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.208
GOALS- AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.776
SPEAKERS BEFORE ME- AS THE

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:50.077
WORLD IS SLOWLY MOVING AWAY

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.179
FROM FOSSIL FUELS AS AN ENERGY

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:53.247
SOURCE. OIL COMPANIES ARE

01:30:53.314 --> 01:30:54.682
RAMPING UP PRODUCTION OF THESE

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.350
PLASTICS AND- PLASTIC

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.853
MATERIALS. SO IT'S REALLY

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.254
INCUMBENT UPON US TO FIGURE OUT

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:01.589
HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:03.024
MATERIALS BECAUSE THE

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.358
CHALLENGES WE HAVE NOW ARE ONLY

01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:05.459
GONNA GET. BIGGER IN THE

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:08.996
FUTURE. SO NEXT LIFE PLEASE.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:11.199
ALL THAT SAID- THIS IS AN ISSUE

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:12.166
THAT THE COUNTY HAS TRIED TO

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.868
TACKLE OVER THE YEARS. SO ONE

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.703
OF THE FIRST EFFORTS WAS A BAN

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.371
ON EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE FOOD

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:19.173
CONTAINERS- THAT WAS LIMITED TO

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.942
COUNTY FACILITIES. AND SHORTLY

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:22.276
AFTER THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PASS

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:23.778
A PLASTIC BAG BAN FOR COUNTY

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:26.113
AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS- AND

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:26.747
WE'RE PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ARE

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:28.749
THE LARGEST RISK. JURISDICTION

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:30.852
DO THAT AT THE TIME. MOST

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:32.386
RECENTLY JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:33.888
OUR BOARD ADOPTED A MOTION

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.323
DIRECTING OUR OFFICE TO LOOK AT

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:37.225
SINGLE USE FOODSERVICE WHERE.

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.594
SPECIFICALLY FIRST OFF WE WERE

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.561
DIRECTED TO CONTRACT WITH

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:42.396
UCLA'S LUSKIN SCHOOL OF POLICY

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:43.965
TO PUT TOGETHER A STUDY OF THE

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:45.399
SPECIFIC IMPACT THAT THESE

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:47.101
PRODUCTS HAVE ON L. A. COUNTY.

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.003
AND THEN FOLLOWING THAT TO

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.503
DRAFT AN ORDINANCE USING

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.839
STAKEHOLDER INPUT- SO NEXT

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:54.342
SLIDE PLEASE. SO I'D LIKE TO

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.643
TAKE A MINUTE NOW TO JUST

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.144
DISCUSS SOME OF THE KEY POINTS%

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.446
FROM THE UCLA STUDY WHICH CAME

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:00.815
OUT IN JANUARY. SO THE STUDY

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.049
WAS BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:03.084
LITERATURE REVIEW AS WELL AS

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.385
INTERVIEWS WITH A NUMBER OF KEY

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.586
STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS LOCAL

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.388
GOVERNMENTS WASTE HAULERS AND

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.323
MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITIES.

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.825
ALTHOUGH WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

01:32:10.892 --> 01:32:11.592
WITH THE WELL KNOWN

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.894
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THESE

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.995
MATERIALS WHICH ARE FIRST PANEL

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.963
DISCUSSED- WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.198
DRIVEN BY THE MORE RECENT

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:18.599
IMPACTS THE WASTE INDUSTRY ALSO

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:19.667
WITH SPRINT NOTED WITH THE

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.068
CHINA AS- YOU'RE STARTING WITH

01:32:21.135 --> 01:32:23.271
CHINA'S NATIONAL SWORD POLICY-

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.805
AND SO A GOOD BIT OF THE UCLA

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:26.407
STUDY WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.342
THAT WASTE MANAGEMENT ASPECT.

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:30.111
SO IN TERMS OF KEY FINDINGS.

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:31.846
FIRST OF OFFICE OFF WHAT THE

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.447
UCLA TEAM FOUND THROUGH

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.716
INTERVIEWS WAS. CONSISTENT WHAT

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:36.817
WE YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD HEARD

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:37.618
THROUGH MEDIA AND OTHER

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.787
REPORTS. DESPITE THERE BEING

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.355
SEVERANCE SEVEN DIFFERENT TYPES

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:43.024
OF RESIN CODES FOR PLASTICS ALL

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:44.525
LABELED WITH FAMOUS CHASING

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:47.161
ARROW SYMBOL- ONLY TWO OF THOSE

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.896
CODES ONE AND TWO ARE COMMONLY

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.865
RECYCLED IN L. A. COUNTY-

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:52.133
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.100
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.869
SUPPORT- THE- RECYCLING FOR

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:57.605
THOSE OTHER PLASTICS. THEY NOW

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:58.973
AND UP IN THE LANDFILL. SECOND

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.208
REGARDLESS OF MATERIAL TYPE- NO

01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:03.077
RECOVERY FACILITIES SERVING L.

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:03.945
A. COUNTY WAS FOUND TO

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:06.013
CONSISTENTLY RECYCLE SINGLE USE

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.982
FOODSERVICE WHERE SPECIFICALLY.

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.216
AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:10.418
OF ISSUES INCLUDING.

01:33:10.484 --> 01:33:12.253
CONTAMINATION WITH FOOD RESIDUE

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.154
AS WELL AS PRODUCT SIZE AND

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.189
MATERIAL. SO IT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.657
EASY TO FORGET THAT RECYCLING

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:18.559
IS REALLY A PHYSICAL PROCESS

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.660
AND AS A RESULT PRODUCT

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.529
CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SIZE SHAPE

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:23.631
COLOR WAIT. HOW CLEAN IT IS

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.466
REALLY CRITICAL FOR THAT

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:28.069
PROCESS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY. SO

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:28.936
YOU KNOW AGAIN WITH THE KEY

01:33:29.003 --> 01:33:30.371
FINDINGS NOW LOOKING AT

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.572
ALTERNATIVES TO PLASTIC FOOD

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.374
SERVICE WHERE. A REUSABLE

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:35.543
UNSURPRISINGLY CAN HAVE IN A

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:36.911
HIGHER INITIAL CAPITAL COST

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:38.379
HOWEVER LONG TERM THEY'RE

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.580
EXPECTED TO HAVE PRETTY CLEAR

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.282
BENEFITS BOTH IN TERMS OF. THE

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:43.551
ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMICALLY-

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:45.553
COMPOSTABLE WHERE WITH A LITTLE

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:48.022
BIT MORE COMPLICATED- WELCOME

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:49.457
POSSIBLE CAN BE BENEFICIAL FROM

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.158
A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. AND

01:33:51.225 --> 01:33:52.159
IN SOME WAYS WOULD BE AN EASIER

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.427
TRANSITION FOR SOME BUSINESSES

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:55.262
AS COMPARED TO RE USABLE THE

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:57.365
MATERIAL REALLY MATTERS. SO

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.699
WHILE THERE ARE CERT FOR

01:33:58.766 --> 01:34:00.401
COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS AND

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:01.635
CERTAINLY MANY PRODUCTS THAT

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.670
LABEL THEMSELVES AS ECO

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:04.638
FRIENDLY- THERE IS A REAL

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.040
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE LABELS

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.875
AND MESSAGING AND HOW THE

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.176
PROCESS ACTUALLY WORKS AT

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.578
COMPOSTING FACILITIES AND SO.

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.513
WHAT THE UCLA TEAM FOUND IS

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:13.280
THAT THE CLEAREST BENEFITS

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:15.483
REALLY CAME FROM A 100% FIBER

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:18.052
BASED. PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:19.787
CHEMICAL TREATMENTS. SO FINALLY

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:20.988
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO

01:34:21.055 --> 01:34:21.956
MENTION IS ABOUT ECONOMIC

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.391
IMPACT OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.526
AND ALTERNATIVES. FIRST LOOKING%

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:26.494
AT THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.295
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MADE IT

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:30.197
SWITCHES TO- ALTERNATIVES OUT

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:32.266
THERE ORDINANCES ORDINANCES AND

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.301
SUCH. THE TEAM AGAIN CONFIRMED

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:35.503
WHAT'S BEEN REPORTED WHICH IS

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.737
THAT JURISDICTION'S REALLY

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:38.406
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY NEGATIVE AND

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.808
ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO BUSINESSES-

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:41.742
EITHER IN THE FORM OF BUSINESS

01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:43.811
CLOSURES OR EVEN APPLICATIONS

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:45.312
FOR HARDSHIP WAIVERS. ON THE

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.415
OTHER HAND. A COST IMPACT TO

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:48.716
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.618
WASTE INDUSTRY RESULTING FROM

01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:52.119
CHANGES IN THE RECYCLING MARKET

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:53.387
AND HAVING TO MANAGE SOME OF

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:54.155
THESE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:56.424
SEVERE- WELL WE CERTAINLY CAN'T

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:57.858
ATTRIBUTE ALL OF THOSE CHANGES

01:34:57.925 --> 01:34:58.959
TO SINGLE USE. PLASTIC

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.128
FOODSERVICE WHERE ALONE- THERE

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.663
HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SHIFT IN THE

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.365
ECONOMIC CALCULUS OF RECYCLING

01:35:04.432 --> 01:35:06.200
PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS. WHILE

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.601
RECYCLING WAS AT ONE TIME A

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:09.236
RELIABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR

01:35:09.303 --> 01:35:11.105
JURISDICTIONS THOSE REVENUES OF

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:12.840
EITHER AT DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:14.108
OR IN SOME CASES PROGRAM

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:15.776
SEVERAL ACTUALLY REQUIRED FUNDS

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.078
FROM JURISDICTIONS IN ORDER TO

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.680
CONTINUE. SO A QUICK EXAMPLE

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.749
FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THAT

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.784
THE UCLA STUDY SITES. WHILE THE

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:25.519
CITY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.420
RECEIVED ABOUT FOUR MILLION

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:27.521
DOLLARS IN REVENUE FROM ITS

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.458
RECYCLING OPERATIONS. IN TWO

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:31.192
THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WAS

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:32.259
REDUCED TO JUST SIX HUNDRED

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.794
THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THIS IS

01:35:33.861 --> 01:35:35.229
SIGNIFICANT ND IT'S LIKELY TO

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:37.098
GET WORSE- AND UNLESS SOMETHING

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:37.998
IS DONE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:39.667
THAT DIFFERENCE. IS GOING TO

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.335
HAVE TO BE SHOULDERED BY LOCAL

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.237
JURISDICTIONS AND RATEPAYERS

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:43.771
ULTIMATELY. ALL RIGHT NEXT

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:47.842
SLIDE. SO THERE ARE OF COURSE A

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:48.776
LOT INTERESTING POINTS IN THE

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.244
STUDY AND IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:51.979
FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED. IN

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:53.214
TAKING A LOOK BUT JUST TO CLOSE

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.449
THE LOOP WITH THE MOTION- YOU

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.318
KNOW WE WERE ON TRACK TO

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:59.220
RELEASE A DRAFT IN APRIL-

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:00.855
UNFORTUNATELY AS WE ALL KNOW

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:03.190
THE- PANDEMIC HIT IN MARCH. AND

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:05.092
AS OF NOW- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.594
PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING IMPACT

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.095
OF COURSE ON OUR LOCAL INTO.

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:10.164
LOCAL RESTAURANT INDUSTRY- AND

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.599
SO FOR NOW THE ORGANS

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:12.700
DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY ON

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.668
HOLD. OKAY SAYS OUR NEXT SLIDE

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:18.305
PLEASE. SO THAT'S SAID- WE ARE

01:36:18.372 --> 01:36:19.440
THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO MOVE

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.242
FORWARD- THERE SOME KEY GAPS

01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:22.343
AND NEXT STEPS IDENTIFIED

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:24.512
THROUGH. THE STUDY AND THERE

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:25.713
ARE WORK THAT I JUST WANT TO

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:27.882
LEAVE YOU WITH AND SO. ONE THAT

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.450
WAS THE NEED FOR CLEAR AND

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.751
CONSISTENT DEFINITIONS AND

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.253
STANDARDS FOR COMPOST ABILITY

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:34.021
AND RECYCLABILITY- THESE

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:35.156
DEFINITIONS REALLY NEED TO

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.657
ALIGN WITH THE REALITY OF WASTE

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.292
MANAGEMENT PROCESSES. AND

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:40.261
FURTHER IT DOES HAVE BEEN DRIVE

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:42.163
PRODUCT LABELING AND DESIGN YOU

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.930
KNOW CONSUMERS AND HAVE TO

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:43.964
BECOME EXPERTS IN MATERIAL

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.433
SCIENCE TO KNOW WHAT BINS TO

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.502
THROW THEIR FASHION- SECOND

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:49.904
WELL IT IS. INCREDIBLY

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.138
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:53.007
RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING WORK.

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.241
AS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THIS

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.476
IS NOT GONNA SOLVE OUR LITTLE

01:36:55.543 --> 01:36:57.044
PART LITTER PROBLEM AS WELL AS

01:36:57.111 --> 01:36:58.445
SOME OF THE THER SECEDED

01:36:58.512 --> 01:36:59.980
ISSUES WITH PLASTIC PRODUCTION.

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.315
AND OUR TOP PRIORITY REALLY

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:02.883
NEEDS TO BE A REDUCING OVERALL

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.485
PRODUCTION OF WASTE. BOTH

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:05.419
THROUGH BETTER PRODUCT DESIGN

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.787
AS WELL AS FINDING WAYS TO

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.856
FACILITATE USE OF REUSABLE-

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:10.057
FUNDING FOR INSTREAM

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.792
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OF COURSE A

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:14.228
HUGE NEED- NOT JUST FOR NEW

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:15.796
FACILITIES BUT ALSO UPGRADED

01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:17.231
EQUIPMENT SUCH AS OPTICAL

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.200
SORTERS A ROBOTIC SORTERS. AT

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:20.534
EXISTING FACILITIES WHICH CAN

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.303
REALLY IMPROVE- THE EFFICIENCY

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:24.672
OF THE RECYCLING PROCESS- AND

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:25.906
FINALLY AND THIS LAST ONE

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:27.041
REALLY TIES INTO EVERYTHING

01:37:27.107 --> 01:37:29.076
ABOVE- THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:29.843
BETTER COLLABORATION WITH

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.012
PRODUCERS- AND IN GENERAL JUST

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:33.380
CONNECTING THAT CYCLE OF

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.248
PRODUCTION WITH THE AND LIFE OF

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:36.050
PRODUCTS. IT'S SIMPLY NOT

01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:37.551
SUSTAINABLE TO ALLOW PRODUCERS

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.986
TO CREATE PRODUCTS WITHOUT ANY

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.287
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HOW THEY

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.021
WILL BE MANAGED AT THE END OF

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:42.690
THEIR LIFE. RIGHT NOW THAT'S

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:44.158
WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE BURDEN

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:45.426
OF MANAGING THESE PRODUCTS AT

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.360
THE END OF THEIR LIFE IS NOW

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:48.162
FALLING ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.798
AND ULTIMATELY RATE PAYERS. SO

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:51.899
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:54.535
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:55.135
COLLABORATING WITH YOU ON THIS

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:57.705
ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.473
YOU CAN STAND BY WE'LL HAVE

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.141
QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:03.611
PANEL DISCUSSION. NEXT WE HAVE

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:05.045
JOHN KENNEDY FROM THE RURAL

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:05.980
COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:07.982
CALIFORNIA AND HE IS HERE

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.517
WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:11.285
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:12.820
TODAY CAN YOU HEAR ME- IS HE

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:14.955
HE'S ON HIS MIGHT. OKAY YEAH I

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:17.891
KNOW. ALL RIGHT. SO BEFORE I

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:19.159
START WANT TO GIVE YOU A VERY

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:20.794
BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MY

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.529
PRESENTATION TODAY. FIRST I

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.498
WANT TO COVER WHO WE ARE AND

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:25.966
HOW WE MANAGE SOLID WASTE AND

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.401
RECYCLABLES. IN RURAL

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.603
CALIFORNIA. NEXT FOCUS ON

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:30.771
CHALLENGES WITH MANAGING

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.673
PLASTIC WASTE AND LITTER AND

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.208
RURAL CALIFORNIA. AND THEN

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:36.710
THIRD FOCUS ON SOME

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:37.711
RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD.

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.380
SO ALL NOTE THAT WHEN WE TALK

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:40.447
ABOUT THE COST OF SOLID WASTE

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:42.116
MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING THESE

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:43.183
AREN'T JUST LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:44.385
COSTS BUT THESE ARE COSTS THAT

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:45.786
ARE BORNE BY ALL RESIDENTS

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:47.988
LIVING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:48.889
AS L. A. COUNTY JUST ALLUDED

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:51.058
TO. SO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.760
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT ROLE

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:54.128
CALIFORNIA WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:56.030
OVERVIEW OF OUR JURISDICTIONS.

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.698
WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN WITH-

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:00.067
WORLD COUNTIES WITHIN RC RC

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.201
STRETCHING FROM THE OREGON

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:03.037
BORDER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

01:39:03.103 --> 01:39:05.539
MEXICO. WE RANGE IN POPULATION

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.441
FROM A LOW OF ABOUT ELEVEN

01:39:07.508 --> 01:39:08.242
HUNDRED RESIDENTS IN ALCORN

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.311
COUNTY. TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:12.012
THOUSAND AND SONOMA COUNTY.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:12.613
NINETEEN OF OUR COUNTIES ARE

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.581
UNDER SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:39:14.648 --> 01:39:16.517
AND FIVE HAVE UNDER FOURTEEN

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:17.818
THOUSAND SO WE'RE PRETTY SMALL

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:18.986
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.587
SOME HAVE NO CITIES THREE HAVE

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.156
NO CITIES AND EIGHT HAVE ONLY A

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:24.158
SINGLE CITY. WE COVER LARGE

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.059
AREAS AND HAVE VERY LOW

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.794
POPULATION DENSITIES AND SO

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.195
THAT CAN PRESENT CHALLENGES FOR

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:30.664
SOLID WASTE COLLECTION- AND

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:31.198
RECYCLABLE COLLECTION AND

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.834
MANAGEMENT. AND THEN WE ALSO

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.769
HAVE SOME VERY LOW MEDIAN

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:36.970
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES AND OUR

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.372
COMMUNITY IS COMPARED TO THE

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:39.807
STATEWIDE AVERAGE WHICH IS

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.809
ABOUT SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.143
DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD THIRTEEN

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:44.211
OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE A

01:39:44.278 --> 01:39:46.380
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES BELOW FIFTY

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:48.015
THOUSAND PER YEAR. A HANDFUL

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:50.084
ARE BELOW FORTY TWO THOUSAND

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:52.386
YEAR. SO THIS IS ALL TO PAINT A

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.421
PICTURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS MANY

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:55.689
MANY MANY VERY DIFFERENT

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.424
JURISDICTIONS WE ALL HAVE

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:58.559
DIFFERENT NEEDS WE ALL HAVE

01:39:58.625 --> 01:40:00.361
DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES. BUT WE

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.261
ALL SHARE SOME SIMILAR

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:04.665
EXPERIENCES AND SOLID WASTE

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:05.866
MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING. SO

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:07.634
MOVING ON THURS THERE'S REALLY

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:09.203
NO SINGLE WAY TO DISCUSS.

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:10.738
DISCUSS OR DESCRIBE SOLID WASTE

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.005
MANAGEMENT RECYCLING IN RURAL

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:13.907
CALIFORNIA. SOME REAL

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.275
JURISDICTIONS ARE SERVED BY

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.710
FRANCHISE HAULERS THOSE

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.178
FRANCHISE HAULERS MAY OR MAY

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:19.847
NOT PROVIDE CURBSIDE COLLECTION

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.281
SERVICES FOR SOLID WASTE AND

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:24.051
RECYCLING. A LOT OF AREAS DON'T

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:26.186
HAVE CURBS AND- CAN'T REALLY

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:27.354
USE CURBSIDE COLLECTION

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.622
SERVICES SO SOME RURAL

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.124
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.492
OUTSIDE OF THE HIGHER DENSITY

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.827
URBAN AREAS. MANAGE THEIR WASTE

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:34.995
EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH SELF

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:37.264
HAULING THAT MEANS THE RESIDENT

01:40:37.331 --> 01:40:38.599
WILL TAKE THEIR OWN TRASH AND

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:40.067
RECYCLABLES. TO TRANSFER

01:40:40.134 --> 01:40:43.804
STATION OR LANDFILL- AND MANAGE

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.639
THEIR WASTE THAT WAY. PLASTICS

01:40:45.706 --> 01:40:47.107
AND PLASTICS AND OTHER

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.409
RECYCLABLES ARE SEPARATED BY

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:50.477
THE RESIDENTS AND THOSE- SELF

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.379
FALL JURISDICTIONS DROPPED OFF

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:54.181
EITHER IN DESIGNATED AREAS OF

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:55.616
THE TRANSFER STATION OR

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.351
LANDFILL OR DROPPED OFF AT

01:40:57.418 --> 01:41:00.154
ANOTHER FACILITY ON THE WAY TO

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:00.654
THE LANDFILL OR TRANSFER

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:04.258
STATION. SO THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.859
WE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.294
MANAGING PLASTIC WASTE THEIR

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:09.196
MANY CHALLENGES THE BIGGEST ONE

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:10.697
IS PROBABLY THE LACK OF END

01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:12.499
MARKETS FOR THOSE MATERIALS. IT

01:41:12.566 --> 01:41:14.001
OFTEN FEELS LIKE WE'RE ON A TWO

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:15.436
LEGGED STOOL WE COLLECT

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.171
MATERIALS AND WE SORT THEM BUT

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:19.306
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THEM TO GO

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:19.940
ONCE WE'VE COLLECTED AND SORTED

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:22.810
THEM. SO IF THEY'RE IN MARKETS

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.144
WERE TYPICALLY PRETTY GOOD AT

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.979
MINING THE WASTE STREAM TO FIND

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:27.714
THOSE MATERIALS EXTRACT THEM

01:41:27.781 --> 01:41:30.784
AND RECYCLE THEM. WE IN RURAL

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:31.652
CALIFORNIA SURE A LOT OF THE

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:33.153
SAME PROBLEMS WITH DIFFICULT TO

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.522
MANAGE AND DIFFICULT TO MARKET-

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:36.557
MATERIALS AS TO URBAN

01:41:36.623 --> 01:41:38.225
COLLEAGUES BUT THOSE PROBLEMS

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:39.793
ARE OFTEN AND HANDS BECAUSE WE

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.228
LACK THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:42.796
THAT ARE FOUND IN URBAN AREAS.

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:43.897
AND IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.299
TRANSPORT THOSE MATERIALS OVER

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:47.201
GREATER DISTANCES PLASTICS ARE

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.403
TYPICALLY LIGHTER WEIGHT- SO

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:50.971
TAKES A LOT MORE VOLUME TO MOVE

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:52.573
THEM AND SOME OF THE NEAREST

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:54.908
MARKETS MAY ACTUALLY BE OUT OF

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:55.409
STATE. GIVEN OUR BORDER

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:59.680
COUNTIES. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:01.215
TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF THE-

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.382
MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:04.451
MATERIALS THAT WE FIND IN RURAL

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:06.753
CALIFORNIA. THAT AREN'T- IS-

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.222
THAT'S WONDERFUL IN SOME URBAN

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:09.723
COMMUNITIES SO THERE ARE TWO

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:12.993
CHALLENGES AND A SUCCESS STORY-

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.361
THE FIRST CHALLENGE CONCERNS

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:16.330
AGRICULTURAL PLASTICS. AND I

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:17.464
WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL IN

01:42:17.531 --> 01:42:18.432
PRACTICE THIS DISCUSSION BY

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.300
SAYING PLASTICS OFTEN SERVE IN

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:21.735
A REALLY INTEGRAL ROLE IN

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.136
AGRICULTURE BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:24.471
PRODUCTION AND MARKETING. SO

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:26.740
I'M NOT HERE TODAY TO. SUGGEST

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.041
THAT WE PHASE OUT THE USE OF

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:30.210
PLASTICS IN AGRICULTURE- BUT I

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:31.011
THINK THIS PRESENTS AN

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:32.813
OPPORTUNITY. TO INCREASE THE

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.350
USE AND RECYCLABILITY OF THOSE

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:36.984
MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THAT

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.585
SECTOR. SOME LOCAL SOLID WASTE

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:39.586
PROGRAMS HAVE RECEIVED

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:40.554
SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:42.422
AGRICULTURAL FILM THAT'S USED

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:44.424
IN PRODUCTION. UNFORTUNATELY

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:45.726
THERE AREN'T MANY MARKETS FOR

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.160
THOSE MATERIALS ALTHOUGH THERE

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.061
ARE A FEW MANUFACTURERS THAT

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.062
ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:50.898
MATERIALS AND USE THEM TO

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:52.366
PRODUCE NEW REUSABLE SHOPPING

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:54.902
BAGS OR NEW AGRICULTURAL FILM.

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.036
THOSE ARE ACTIVITIES WE SHOULD

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.205
SUPPORT AND EXPAND GIVEN THE

01:42:58.272 --> 01:42:59.573
ROLE THE PLASTIC PLAYS AND

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.108
PRODUCTION MARKETING. BECAUSE

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.476
WITHOUT MARKETS THE MATERIAL

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:03.877
GOES IN THE LANDFILL WORKING

01:43:03.944 --> 01:43:05.479
ACTUALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:05.979
MANAGE IN THE LANDFILL

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:08.448
ENVIRONMENT. SIMILAR PROBLEMS

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:09.449
EXIST FOR PLASTIC IRRIGATION

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.618
LINE. THAT OFTEN WINDS UP IN

01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:12.786
THE LANDFILL AND CAN POSE

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.588
SIGNIFICANT. MANAGEMENT

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:17.224
PROBLEMS TO. SOME OF OUR

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:18.959
COUNTIES HAVE A LOT OF THESE

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:20.527
MATERIALS COMING IN FROM

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:22.696
CANNABIS GROWS A LOT FROM

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:25.132
ILLEGAL CANNABIS GROWS AS WELL-

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.700
IN TRINITY COUNTY THEY SHARED

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:28.602
SOME EXAMPLES OF HELICOPTERS.

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:31.438
BRINGING AND BALES- IRRIGATION

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:34.708
LINE THAT WAS BROUGHT OUT OF

01:43:34.775 --> 01:43:36.343
FEDERAL FOREST LANDS. SO MOVING

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.312
FROM THOSE MARINE DEBRIS IS A

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.613
PROBLEM IN SOME OF OUR COASTAL

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.515
AREAS THEY REPORTED PROBLEMS

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:42.950
WITH ABANDONED PLASTIC FISHING

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:44.618
GEAR INCLUDING NETTING BELIEVES

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:46.653
CAGES. THEY'RE LARGELY PLASTIC

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.088
BASE BUT THERE'S NO MARKET FOR

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:49.056
THEM ONCE WE CAN PULL THEM OUT

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:50.490
OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO

01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:51.024
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO THE

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:54.361
LANDFILL. BUT THE SUCCESS STORY

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.228
IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:57.397
ME- IT CONCERNS PESTICIDE

01:43:57.464 --> 01:44:00.033
CONTAINERS. SB SEVENTEEN TWENTY

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.234
THREE OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BY

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:02.803
SENATOR MALDONADO REQUIRES

01:44:02.869 --> 01:44:04.237
PESTICIDE MANUFACTURERS TO

01:44:04.304 --> 01:44:05.405
PARTICIPATE IN RECYCLING

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:07.941
PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT HDP

01:44:08.008 --> 01:44:08.675
PESTICIDE CONTAINERS ARE

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:11.778
RECYCLED. LOCALS OFTEN COUNTIES

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:13.380
WHOSE PERIODICAL ACTION EVENT

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.349
AT WHICH THEY ACCEPT CERTIFIED

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:16.216
TRIPLE RINSE PESTICIDE

01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:17.784
CONTAINERS THOSE ARE THEN

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.486
SHIPPED ON SITE AND HOLD OFF TO

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:21.254
BE RECYCLED. USUALLY MADE INTO

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.056
FENCE POST PALETTE SPEED BUMPS

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.491
MARINE PILINGS A LOT OF

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.692
PRODUCTS THAT REALLY HAVE VERY

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.494
LITTLE IF ANY INTERFACE WITH

01:44:27.561 --> 01:44:29.730
THE GENERAL- CONSUMERS. SO

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:31.465
THEY'RE SAFE USES. THE PROGRAM

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:32.866
IS FUNDED BY MANUFACTURERS AND

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.001
IT'S BEEN REALLY INCREDIBLY

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.569
HELPFUL TO KEEP A LARGE

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:36.737
QUANTITIES PLASTICS OUT OF OUR

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:40.707
LANDFILLS. AND TO SEE THEM

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:41.341
RECYCLED IN THE NEWER PRODUCTS.

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.243
AND GOING TO LITTER LIKE SOME

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.311
OF OUR URBAN COLLEAGUES RURAL

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:45.946
AREAS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.381
WITH LITTER. ROADSIDE LITTER

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:49.683
WAS ONCE BOTTLES CANS AND PAPER

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.652
BUT IT'S NOW MUCH MORE PLASTICS

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.420
BASED INCLUDING FOOD PACKAGING.

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:54.855
SINGLE USE BAGS BLOWING IN THE

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:56.456
WIND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.225
PROBLEM IN HIGH WIND AREAS

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.092
ESPECIALLY MODEL COUNTY WE'VE

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:01.495
HEARD- AND I'VE HEARD FROM SOME

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.363
OF OUR MEMBERS AS SHIFT BACK TO

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:05.332
PAPER BAGS OF YESTERDAY COULD

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:06.299
HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE

01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:10.137
PROBLEMS. ESPECIALLY WITH-RESPECT TO THE BAGS BLOWING IN

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:11.605
THE WIND AND THE NOT TO GRADING

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:12.873
IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND COULD

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:13.840
ALSO ADDRESS SOME OTHER

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:16.910
PROBLEMS WITH- THAT THE PAPER

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:18.178
MARKET FIVE MARKET. AND

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:19.713
LITTERING. CLEAN UP CAN BE

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.348
REALLY DIFFICULT AND COSTLY GOT

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:22.849
A COUPLE EXAMPLES SISKIYOU

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:24.818
COUNTY SO SPEND ABOUT SIX

01:45:24.885 --> 01:45:26.186
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR PINE.

01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:28.321
LARGE TRASH BAGS FOR COMMUNITY

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:30.090
ORGANIZATIONS TO GO OUT AND

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:30.691
PICK UP LITTER ALONG THE ROAD

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.693
AND THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:33.627
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A LOT

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:34.695
OF MONEY FOR A COMMUNITY OF

01:45:34.761 --> 01:45:36.763
ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS.

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:37.931
AND THEN MODOC COUNTY TRIES TO

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.200
HIRE INMATE CREWS WHERE THEY

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:40.767
CAN. TO GO OUT AND CLEAN UP

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:43.737
LATER. AND RELATED A LETTER.

01:45:43.804 --> 01:45:44.705
ONE OF THE LONGEST AND MOST

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.073
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES MANY

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:47.307
RESIDENTS WHO HAD WITH PLASTIC

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.642
RECYCLING. IS THE BEVERAGE

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.643
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:51.211
THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY.

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.579
THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED AND

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:54.481
INTENDED TO COMBAT LITTERED

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:55.749
BOTTLES AND CANS THAT HAVE NOW

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:57.117
SHIFTED PREDOMINANTLY TO

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.152
PLASTIC BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:00.787
OF WOMEN ABOUT THEIR AND GLASS.

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:01.755
ROGAN HAS GENERALLY BEEN

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.390
SUCCESSFUL IN RECYCLING

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:03.890
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.325
REDUCING LETTER. BUT

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.793
UNFORTUNATELY MANY CONSUMERS

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.328
EXPERIENCES REALLY SOURED OVER

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:09.663
THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE OF

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:10.864
THE WIDESPREAD LACK OF

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.699
REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. THIS

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.634
HITS ESPECIALLY HARD IN RURAL

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:16.937
AREAS. SOME COUNTIES HAVE NO

01:46:17.003 --> 01:46:17.804
REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES

01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:19.639
WHATSOEVER FOR THE RESIDENTS SO

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:20.741
WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING MORE OF

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:22.542
THOSE BOTTLES AND CANS. GOING

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.644
TO THE LANDFILL WHERE BECOMES

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.447
REALLY EXPENSIVE TRASH. AND SO

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:28.782
THE REDEMPTION CENTER COLLAPSE

01:46:28.849 --> 01:46:29.983
REALLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.551
HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:32.519
IMPACT ON LOWER INCOME

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:34.387
RESIDENTS BOTH IN RURAL AREAS.

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:36.523
AND URBAN AREAS WHERE THE RATIO

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.625
OF CENTERS TO POPULATION IS

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.794
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH. SO NEXT

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:43.063
ALL TURN TO RECOMMENDATIONS THE

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.431
FIRST RECOMMENDATION PERHAPS

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.666
THE STRONGEST RECOMMENDATION WE

01:46:46.733 --> 01:46:48.335
HAVE TO INCREASE MANUFACTURING

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:49.503
GAUGE MINT. FOR THE LAST

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:50.537
SEVERAL DECADES LOCAL

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:51.671
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN CHARGED

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:52.706
WITH MEETING THE STATE SOLID

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:54.141
WASTE DIVERSION RECYCLING

01:46:54.207 --> 01:46:55.876
REQUIREMENTS ALONE. THE LOCAL

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:57.477
GOVERNMENTS AS YOU HEARD WE

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.912
HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT ENDS

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:02.115
UP IN- IN THE MARKET PLACE. WE

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:03.183
NEED GREATER ENGAGEMENT BY

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.451
PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS WITH

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:06.219
RESPECT TO PRODUCT DESIGN AND

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:07.788
THE USE OF RECYCLED PRODUCTS

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:09.890
RECYCLED MATERIALS. FOR PRODUCT

01:47:09.956 --> 01:47:11.925
DESIGN MANUFACTURE SHOULD FOCUS

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:12.759
ON DESIGNING PRODUCTS THAT ARE

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:14.461
READILY RECYCLABLE NOT JUST

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:16.329
THEORETICALLY RECYCLABLE AND

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.931
FOR WHICH THERE ARE MARKETS

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:18.365
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.666
CONSIDERATION AS WELL.

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:21.434
HOMOGENIZATION OF PACKAGING

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:22.068
MATERIALS COULD REDUCE

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:25.672
CONTAMINATION AND MAKE IT MUCH

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:26.206
EASIER TO FIND MARKETS FOR

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:27.941
THOSE CUTS. INCREASE IN THE USE

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.242
OF RECYCLED MATERIALS AND

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:31.278
PRODUCTS WILL INCREASE DEMAND

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:32.012
FOR PLASTICS COMING OUT OF THE

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:34.080
WAY SYSTEM. WE SHOULD FOCUS

01:47:34.147 --> 01:47:35.282
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON

01:47:35.348 --> 01:47:37.217
CREATION OF. INNOVATIVE

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:38.385
PRODUCTS THAT USE LESS

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:40.053
MARKETABLE MATERIALS AND THAT

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.721
ARE SCALABLE CALTRANS IS

01:47:41.788 --> 01:47:43.123
CURRENTLY USING SOME BEVERAGE

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:45.759
CONTAINERS AND PILOT PROJECTS

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:46.560
FOR ROAD PAVING THAT'S REALLY

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.895
INTRIGUING- BUT WE'RE GOING TO

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.063
SEE SOME COMPETITION FOR THOSE

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:51.364
MATERIALS. AS BEVERAGE

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:52.833
CONTAINER MANY FACTORS HAS TO

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:55.769
USE THEM TO COMPLY WITH EIGHTY

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:56.336
SEVEN NINETY THREE TEN FROM

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:57.571
LAST YEAR SO THERE'S A QUESTION

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.005
COULD CALTRANS USE OTHER TYPES

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:00.974
OF RESINS. SOME OTHER LESS

01:48:01.041 --> 01:48:01.875
MARKETABLE MATERIALS FOR THOSE

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:05.178
PROJECT. IS THAT BETTER THAN

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:07.214
WHAT THEY'RE USING TODAY. AND

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.550
THEN. THROUGH THE CREATION OF

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.953
LOCAL AND DOMESTIC MARKETS- WE

01:48:13.019 --> 01:48:15.355
CAN HELP MAXIMIZE BENEFITS FOR

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:17.057
THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY AND

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:18.625
JOB CREATION IN THE STATE SO

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:19.793
RATHER THAN SHIPPING OUR WASTE

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.528
OVERSEAS WHERE WE HOPE THAT IT

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:23.430
GETS RECYCLED INTO SOMETHING

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:24.998
ELSE LET'S FIND A WAY TO CREATE

01:48:25.065 --> 01:48:27.467
JOBS HERE. AND THEN FINALLY ONE

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:28.368

01:49:59.426 --> 01:50:00.860
HEARD PLASTICS GENERATION IS

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:02.195
INCREASING AS WE MOVE TOWARD

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.030
USING MORE SINGLE USE

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:04.531
DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS AND

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.499
PACKAGING. THERE'S INCREASED

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:07.701
COMPLEXITY OF PLASTIC PRODUCTS

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:09.102
ON THE MARKET SUCH AS

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:10.770
MULTILAYER MATERIALS FLEXIBLE

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.505

OR VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS HAVE NOT

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.250
BEEN SUFFICIENT TO STOP PLASTIC

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:25.318
FROM ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:27.954

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.665
INTRODUCTORY PRESENTATION. AND

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:39.132
WE HAVE SOME ANECDOTAL

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:40.433
INFORMATION ABOUT THE INCREASE

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:42.235
IN PLASTICS SUCH AS SINGLE USE

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:44.304
PLASTIC FOOTWEAR ITEMS PP AND

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:46.072
PLASTIC PACKAGING. MUCH OF THIS

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:49.409
HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY COVERT

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:50.043
NINETEEN. COVERS LIKE WILL HAVE

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.144
SOME ADDITIONAL DATA ON

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:52.078
RECYCLING FROM OUR NEW

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:52.846
RECYCLING AND DISPOSAL

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:55.015
REPORTING SYSTEM. HOWEVER

01:50:55.081 --> 01:50:56.049
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY WOULD BE

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:57.417
NEEDED FOR CAL RECYCLE TO

01:50:57.484 --> 01:51:01.054
OBTAIN A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:01.588
OF PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:02.188
RECYCLING IN THE STATE. YOU'VE

01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:03.423
ALREADY HEARD THAT OF ALL THE

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:05.525
PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED ONLY

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:08.228
ABOUT 9% IS RECYCLED. 12% WAS

01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:10.263
INCINERATED IN THE- 79% THAT

01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:11.531
WAS LEFT WAS EITHER CUMULATED

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:13.867
LANDFILLS OR SKIPPED INTO THE

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:16.302
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. CURRENTLY

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:18.104
42% PLASTIC PRODUCED COMES IN

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.840
THE FORM OF PACKAGING. AND MOST

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:23.410
OF THAT- IS DISPOSED WITHIN THE

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:25.979
SAME YEAR THAT IT WAS BLACK.

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:27.113
IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.748
PLASTIC IS A SIGNIFICANT PART

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:29.816
OF THE WASTE MANAGEMENT

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:31.117
RECYCLING CHALLENGES THE STATE

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:33.086
IS FACING BUT WE CAN'T SOLVE

01:51:33.153 --> 01:51:34.087
THE PROBLEM BY FOCUSING ON

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:35.855
PLASTIC ALONE. WE NEED TO FOCUS

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.690
ON HOLISTIC SOLUTIONS FIRST

01:51:37.757 --> 01:51:39.292
REDUCING WASTE AND THEN

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.427
INCREASED MANUFACTURE

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.662
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:43.363
THE MATERIALS THAT THEY'RE

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:44.731
BRINGING IT TO THE STATE. TO

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.066
MAKE SURE WHICH GENERATED CAN

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:47.600
BE MANAGED WITH IN OUR

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:48.101
INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:52.105
CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:52.939
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS CHART

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:54.574
PROCESS PRESENTATION BUT I'D

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:55.642
LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AN IMPORTANT

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:57.544
DATA POINT FROM THE SHARP.

01:51:57.610 --> 01:52:00.713
PLASTIC IS MAKINGUP 11% OF OUR

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:01.381
DISPOSED WASTE STREAM IN TWENTY

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:03.383
EIGHTEEN. IN PLASTIC PACKAGING

AND PACKAGING RELATED MATERIAL

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:06.252
IN THE WASTE STREAM HAS

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:07.387
INCREASED SINCE TWENTY

01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:09.189
FOURTEEN. BOTH THIS PROPORTION

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:11.057

TONNAGE. THIS INCREASE IN

01:52:13.259 --> 01:52:13.927
PLASTIC PACKAGING IS

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.929
SIGNIFICANT SINCE PLASTIC IS

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.230
VERY LIGHT IT MEANS THAT

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.198
GENERATION CONTINUES TO

01:52:18.264 --> 01:52:21.000
INCREASE AT A RATE THAT DOESN'T

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:21.835
MATCH OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE.

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:25.872

AN IMPENDING BAN ON ALL SOLID

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:41.641
WASTE IMPORTS. AND CURRENTLY.

01:54:41.708 --> 01:54:43.009
INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION OF

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.444
SOLID WASTE IS RECYCLED IS

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:46.779
RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. CHINA WAS

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:47.947
THE FIRST COUNTRY TO INTRODUCE

01:54:48.014 --> 01:54:49.949
RESTRICTIVE IMPORT POLICIES AND

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:50.950
HAVE BEEN TIGHTENING THOSE

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:52.952
POLICIES YEAR AFTER YEAR. MOST

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.354
OF THE REDUCTION IN EXPORTS

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.455
MATERIALS PARTICULARLY MIXED

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:56.923
PLASTICS WAS DUE TO CHINA'S

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:58.925
POLICIES. WE'VE STILL BEEN ABLE

01:54:58.992 --> 01:55:00.426
TO MOVE SOME MATERIAL TO CHINA

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:01.527
BUT THAT MIGHT BE CHANGING WITH

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:03.863
THIS IMPENDING BACK. SINCE

01:55:03.930 --> 01:55:04.497
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OTHER COUNTRIES

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:07.100
ON. MAINLY IN SOUTHEAST AND

01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:08.801
SOUTH ASIA HAVE INTRODUCED

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:10.270
SIMILAR POLICIES TO CHINA'S

01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:13.339
POLICIES. AND OF THE LAST MAJOR

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:14.307
IMPENDING CHANGES THE BASEL

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:16.542
CONVENTION AMENDMENTS ON MIXED

01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:18.411
PLASTICS PLEASE TAKE THESE TAKE

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:20.280
PLACE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY ONES

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:20.813
WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.282
CORNER. THE DALLAS THE

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.783
CONVENTION IS A MULTILATERAL

01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:25.451
ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT IN TO

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:26.919
PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:28.121
ENVIRONMENT AGAINST THE ADVERSE

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:30.156
EFFECTS OF WASTE. THE GROUP OF

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.891
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SIGNED ON

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:33.593
VOTED TO PLACE NEW RESTRICTIONS

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.561
ON SCRAP PLASTICS PRIMARILY

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:37.630
AFFECTING MIXED PLASTICS. WHAT

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:38.498
THIS MEANS IS THAT ALLOWABLE

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:40.466
PLASTICS CAN ONLY BE EXPORTED

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:41.868
WHEN BOTH PARTIES HAVE GIVEN

01:55:41.934 --> 01:55:43.770
WRITTEN CONSENT. IT'S IMPORTANT

01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:46.005
TO NOTE THAT THE US HAS NEVER

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:47.707
RATIFIED THE CONVENTION. THE

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:48.808
OTHER PARTY COUNTRIES ARE NOT

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:50.109
ALLOWED TO TRADE WITH NON PARTY

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:51.244
COUNTRIES EXCEPT UNDER

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:52.779
BILATERAL OR MULTILATERAL

01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.714
AGREEMENTS. SO WHAT DO THESE

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.516
POLICIES MEAN. THERE ARE LESS

01:55:56.582 --> 01:55:57.950
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:00.019
EXPORT RECYCLABLES. ESPECIALLY

01:56:00.086 --> 01:56:02.422
THOSE LIKE MIXED PLASTICS THAT

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:03.056
HAVE QUESTIONABLE INTERNATIONAL

01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:05.258
MARKETS. THIS PROVIDES BOTH

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:05.792
WITH THE CHALLENGE AND THE

01:56:05.858 --> 01:56:07.360
OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THESE

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:09.329
MATERIALS. AND PROCESS MORE

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:11.297
MATERIALS DOMESTICALLY NEXT

01:56:11.364 --> 01:56:14.000
SLIDE. AS MENTIONED THERE'S

01:56:14.067 --> 01:56:15.401
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN

01:56:15.468 --> 01:56:16.703
BOTH EXPORTS OF HIGHER VALUE

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:19.072
PLASTICS LIKE PT IN HD THAT'S

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:20.640
THE FIRST CHART ON THE LEFT AS

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:22.675
WELL AS LOWER VALLEY MIXED

01:56:22.742 --> 01:56:23.676
PLASTICS. AND THAT'S THE CHART

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.411
ON THE RIGHT. THESE DECREASES

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:28.181
ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF THE

01:56:28.247 --> 01:56:28.781
POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:29.582
PREVIOUS SLIDE. ALL RIGHT NEXT

01:56:29.649 --> 01:56:33.619
SLIDE. KARAKUL HAS A NUMBER OF

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.521
PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PLASTICS

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:36.889
ROSS DISCUSSED A FEW OF OUR KEY

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:38.558
PROGRAMS LISTED HERE AND

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:39.625
ALTHOUGH THESE PROGRAMS ARE

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:40.693
IMPORTANT FOR REDUCING PLASTIC

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.428
WASTE THE ONLY ADDRESS A NARROW

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:43.863
PORTION OF THE PLASTICS

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.998
GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT

01:56:46.065 --> 01:56:49.602
SLIDE. SO NOW THA THESE

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:50.103
PLASTICS ARE STAYING IN

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:51.204
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:52.905
CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME TO

01:56:52.972 --> 01:56:54.674
RESPONSIBLY MANAGE THEM HERE.

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:55.808
FIRST CHALLENGES THAT THERE'S

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.243
NO CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT IS

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.445
GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.079
ACTUALLY BEING RECYCLED IN THE

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:02.248
STATE. IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:03.883
DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.184
EFFECTIVELY SORT THE MERIT OF

01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:08.454
PLASTICS. AND PLASTICS PRODUCTS

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:10.523
AND PACKAGING THAT ENTER THE

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:11.991
RECYCLING SYSTEM. PLASTIC

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:13.693
MATERIAL QUALITIES INCONSISTENT

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.728
COLLECTED CONTAMINATION IS AN

01:57:15.795 --> 01:57:17.563
ISSUE. BUT SO IS THE SHEER

01:57:17.630 --> 01:57:19.799
VARIETY OF MATERIALS. IN

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:21.300
PRODUCTS SOMETIMES RECYCLERS

01:57:21.367 --> 01:57:22.602
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS TO

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:24.804
SPECIFIC MATERIAL TO COLLECTOR

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.539
BALAK MATERIAL. ANOTHER

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.274
CHALLENGES AS OIL PRICES ARE

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:30.109
LOW VIRGIN PLASTIC IS MUCH

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.711
CHEAPER THAN RECYCLE PLASTIC

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:34.080
DRIVING DOWN SCRAP VALUE OF

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:36.582
RECYCLED PLASTIC. WITH THE NEW

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:37.583
GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS REGARDING

01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:39.085
PLASTICS LIKE THE BALLOT THE

01:57:39.152 --> 01:57:40.920
CONVENTION CALIFORNIA WILL NO

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:43.156
LONGER BE ABLE TO RELY. ON

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:45.458
EXPORTS FOR RECYCLING. IT'S

01:57:45.525 --> 01:57:47.160
OFTEN DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WHAT

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:48.394
IS THE MEASURE ADDITIONAL

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:49.729
AUTHORITY WOULD BE NEEDED FOR

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:50.630
CAL RECYCLE TO COLLECT

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:52.165
ADDITIONAL DATA ON THE

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:53.199
GENERATION OF PLASTIC. NEXT

01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:57.270
SLIDE. SO WHAT ARE THE

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:59.372
SOLUTIONS THE FIRST IS ALWAYS

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:01.407
THE FIRST PART REDUCE.

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.809
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN WHICH

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:04.644
GENERATION MEANS MORE STUFF TO

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.446
MANAGE NEED TO WORKTOGETHER TO

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:08.648
IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:09.215
REDUCE PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:12.518
PACKAGING. WASTE ALSO CAN BE

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:13.019

THROUGH SOURCE REDUCTION BUT

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:17.623
ALSO TO ENSURE WHAT IS BEING

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:19.158
GENERATED CAN BE MANAGED TO OUR

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:23.930
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

01:58:23.996 --> 01:58:25.865
SECOND OPTION IS THE SECOND ARE

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:48.074
PACKAGING IN STATE FACILITIES

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:48.774
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE

02:00:48.841 --> 02:00:50.376
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE

02:00:50.443 --> 02:00:51.310
AUTHORITY TO DEFINE THESE

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:52.979
TERMS. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:55.681
WHAT IS ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE AND

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:57.016
COMPOSTABLE IN THE STATE.

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.017
THERE'S POTENTIAL THAT THESE

02:00:58.084 --> 02:00:59.585
DEFINITIONS COULD HAVE BROADER

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.053
APPLICABILITY IF WE SEE

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:01.988
PACKAGING LEGISLATION IN THE

02:01:02.054 --> 02:01:04.056
FUTURE. THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR

02:01:04.123 --> 02:01:05.691
LARGE SCALE REFORM. SO IN

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:07.693
CLOSING EXPANSION OF RECYCLING

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:08.794
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IN

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:10.029
THE REGION. AS WELL AS

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.430
OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THE

02:01:11.497 --> 02:01:12.164
AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE WE

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:15.434
CREATE. WILL BE KEY IN REDUCING

02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:16.035
THE IMPACT OF PLASTICS IN THE

02:01:16.102 --> 02:01:18.604
FUTURE. HOWEVER BUILDING MORE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.672
DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:22.141
SUFFICIENT BY ITSELF. MANY

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:23.309
PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING

02:01:23.376 --> 02:01:24.510
CURRENTLY BEING SOLD IN THE

02:01:24.577 --> 02:01:26.479
STATE DESPITE CLAIMS OF

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:28.981
RECYCLABLE AND REUSABLE- IN

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.616
COMPOSTABLE AREN'T REALITY NOT

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.518
COMPATIBLE WITH CALIFORNIA'S

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.220
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE YOU

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:36.355
CAN EVEN ACCESS CONTAMINANT WAS

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:38.024
LIKELY PROCESS. A MORE

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.425
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:41.360
WHAT'S NEEDED ONE THAT REDUCES

02:01:41.427 --> 02:01:42.695
WASTE LOOKS UPSTREAM THAT

02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:44.263
PRODUCT DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE

02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:46.065
RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPORTS A

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.733
CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO REDUCE THE

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.368
ENVIRONMENTAL GREENHOUSE GAS

02:01:49.435 --> 02:01:51.671
IMPACTS THE PLASTIC GENERATION

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:54.473
MANAGING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.509
VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:01:56.575 --> 02:01:57.877
THE PRESENTATION I HAVE A

02:01:57.943 --> 02:01:59.712
QUESTION FOR YOU AND THEN I

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.547
THINK I'LL SEE IF MY-

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:03.182
COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY OTHER

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:03.749
QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND THEN

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:04.250
WE'LL MOVE TO THE OTHER

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:06.085
PANELISTS. I MY QUESTION TO YOU

02:02:06.152 --> 02:02:08.087
IS WHETHER THE DIFFERENT

02:02:08.154 --> 02:02:09.722
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CAL EPA

02:02:09.789 --> 02:02:11.891
ACCORD NEED AT ALL ANY OF THEIR

02:02:11.957 --> 02:02:14.293
EFFORTS TO TACKLE THE PLASTIC

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.327
POLLUTION THAT'S ALREADY IN THE

02:02:15.394 --> 02:02:16.328
ENVIRONMENT GOING INTO THE

02:02:16.395 --> 02:02:17.630
ENVIRONMENT PARTICULARLY THE

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:19.398
WASTE TREATMENT IN WATER WASTE.

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:20.499
AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:22.268
THERE'S NEW EMERGING DATA ABOUT

02:02:22.334 --> 02:02:24.704
AIRBORNE PLASTIC POLLUTION SO

02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:25.471
MORNING IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:28.574
THAT AS WELL. YEAH STOURPORT

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:30.209
WITHIN THE KELLY K. FAMILY ON A

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:31.610
NUMBER OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.512
WITH THE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND-

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:36.916
ALSO THE ON- OPC AS WELL AS ON

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:38.451
THEIR DEVELOPING. THAT LOOK

02:02:38.517 --> 02:02:40.453
MORE. PLASTICS ARE SKIPPING

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:43.489
INTENT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT ON

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.891
IS FAR AS THE URBAN AND OF

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:48.661
CLASS ON. I NOT SURE BUT I

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:50.496
WOULD CHIU BECAUSE THAT IS AN

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:51.931
IMPORTANT EMERGING AREA IN

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:57.670
WHICH WE NEED TO FOCUS IN. ON

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:58.571
THANK YOU AND ALSO SEE IF ANY

02:02:58.637 --> 02:02:59.438
OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS. FOR

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:00.339
YOU BEFORE MOVED TO THE US TWO

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:03.909
PANEL. IS GARCIA. YES THAT.

02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:05.444
THANK YOU I PAUL IF I'M A

02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:10.149
LITTLE. BUT OFTEN HE SAID AT

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:14.653
THE TIME OF THE DAY SO FOR ME-

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:15.621
I HAD A QUESTION- EARLIER ABOUT

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:17.056
INFRASTRUCTURE I. THE MONEY

02:03:17.123 --> 02:03:19.391
DOLLAR AT THAT WILL INDUSTRY IS.

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:20.292
HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TO

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.093
CONVINCE US THAT WE CAN RECYCLE

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.661
WAY OUT OF PROBLEM I EVEN

02:03:22.728 --> 02:03:24.497
THOUGH WE CAN'T- AND THE FACT

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.398
THAT IF WE KNOW THERE MOVING.

02:03:26.465 --> 02:03:27.767
OF THEIR BUSINESS INTO

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:29.335
PRODUCING PETROCHEMICALS AND

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:31.403
PLASTICS A SET OF WHAT WE THINK

02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:33.038
ABOUT THEM CONVENTIONALLY DO WE

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:35.074
KNOW IF THEY ARE ALSO INVESTING

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:37.676
IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:41.514
THIS. YEAH THERE ARE SOME

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.315
INDUSTRY INITIATIVES RIGHT NOW.

02:03:43.382 --> 02:03:45.317
WHERE THERE ARE INVESTMENTS IN

02:03:45.384 --> 02:03:48.220
NON. IN MORE DOMESTIC RECYCLING

02:03:48.287 --> 02:03:51.090
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES- I

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:52.958
DON'T KNOW THE- THE SCALE OF

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.660
THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:56.695
IMPACTFUL TO BE GIVEN THAT YOU

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:58.731
KNOW IS. THERE'S ONLY 9% OF

02:03:58.798 --> 02:03:59.465
PLASTICS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.167
BEING RECYCLED GLOBALLY SO

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:02.468
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME IN THIS

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:03.736
INVESTMENTS AND SOME ON

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:07.039
INDUSTRY. IT'S HARD TO KNOW.

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:09.341
HOW FAR THEY'LL GO IN MAKING

02:04:09.408 --> 02:04:12.077
THIS. DENT IN THE CHALLENGES

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:15.714
WITH RECYCLING PLASTICS. AND

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:17.383
THEN WHEN YOU- AND TO BE THIS

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:19.752
NEED TO TALK ABOUT WE USED TO.

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:22.054
A LOT OF THIS MATERIAL FOR. AND

02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:23.222
WE'RE NOT ANYMORE BUT WITH IT

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:24.490
BEING RECYCLING IT WAS BEING

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:26.992
EXPORTED. AND THAT'S THE

02:04:27.059 --> 02:04:28.761
CHALLENGE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WE

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:30.796
KNOW THAT SOME OF IT WAS- BUT

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:32.565
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OUR

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:34.166
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- WHAT

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:38.270
WERE EXPORTING FAILS OF- SINGLE

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:40.940
MATERIALS TO LIKE ADJUSTED PTB

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:42.174
THAT'S RELATIVELY CLEAN OR JUST

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:43.876
EACH DETAIL. AND THAT'S

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:45.177
GENERALLY GETTING RECYCLED THE

02:04:45.244 --> 02:04:46.779
CHALLENGES AND THE MIXED

02:04:46.846 --> 02:04:48.113
PLASTIC BALES THOSE BALES OF

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.949
PLASTICS THREE THROUGH SEVEN

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.317
WORKS HARD TO SAY WHAT'S

02:04:51.383 --> 02:04:52.852
HAPPENING WITH THOSE WE KNOW

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:54.587
THAT SOMETIMES PUBLIC PROBABLY

02:04:54.653 --> 02:04:56.188
NUMBER FIVE IS PULLED OUT OF

02:04:56.255 --> 02:04:58.090
THOSE. AND RECYCLED BUT SOME OF

02:04:58.157 --> 02:04:59.692
THOSE OTHER PLASTICS WE JUST

02:04:59.758 --> 02:05:01.126
DON'T KNOW. WHAT ACTUALLY

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:02.461
HAPPENS TO THEM ONCE THEY'RE

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:06.932
EXPORTED. COUNTRIES AND THEN

02:05:06.999 --> 02:05:09.101
FINALLY I YOU'VE BEEN. TRACKING

02:05:09.168 --> 02:05:12.004
MORE DATA. ON AND IN THIS. OUR

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:14.707
WE- DO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF LIKE

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:15.674
EQUITY TOOLS THAT WOULD HELP

02:05:15.741 --> 02:05:17.076
PRIORITIZE COMMUNITIES OF

02:05:17.142 --> 02:05:19.044
COLORS OR REAL COMMUNITIES THAT

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:22.114
ARE- ACTED IN AN DIFFERENT WAYS

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:23.682
IN INEXORABLY I TO MAKE SURE

02:05:23.749 --> 02:05:25.551
THAT AS WE ARE. ALLOCATING

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:27.386
DOLLARS TO RESOURCES THAT WE

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.889
DID IT IN AN EQUITABLE WAY. HE

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:32.358
ALSO WON THE ALSO ARE RELY ON-

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:35.628
AND VIRUS FREE. S. ON A TOOL

02:05:35.694 --> 02:05:37.630
FOR WEB WHERE ON AWARDING

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:40.966
ACROSS SO WE- GIVE OUR- GRANT

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:43.168
YOU THE OPERA HOUSE GAS WE

02:05:43.235 --> 02:05:46.238
DON'T FUND FOR INTEREST IN THIS.

02:05:46.305 --> 02:05:48.807
AND WE HAVE A FIBER PLASTIC IN

02:05:48.874 --> 02:05:51.644
LAST GRANT WHICH- WE INVEST IN

02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:54.513
IN. TO WORST THOSE- AND WE USE

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.548
COUNT SCREEN ON TO HELP US I

02:05:56.615 --> 02:06:01.987
DON'T. YES AND WHICH TO. INVEST

02:06:02.054 --> 02:06:06.492
THOSE THOSE- THOSE FRIENDS BUT

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:07.927
AS YOU GET MY- THERE ARE ON IN

02:06:07.993 --> 02:06:09.828
BURMA JUSTICE CONCERN ABOUT

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:12.031
OFFICE SO IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:13.399
AS WERE THINKING ABOUT IF YOU

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.301
INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA IF WE

02:06:15.367 --> 02:06:17.603
WANTED TO BUT STILL- DEVELOP

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:18.971
MORE DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.606
PROCESS RECYCLED. THAT WE'RE

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:21.974
DOING IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE AN

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:25.344
AND TO COMMUNITIES- AND RIGHT

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:27.613
NOW WE'RE USING SCREEN AS OUR

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:28.647
AS OUR SCREEN TOOL TO IDENTIFY

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:30.916
THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE AND I'M

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:31.817
MUCH OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH ON

02:06:31.884 --> 02:06:33.986
THE LOCAL CITING OF THESE

02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:34.586
FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:36.522
HAVE A ORDINATED APPROACH WHEN

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:39.358
THESE FACILITIES ARE GETTING

02:06:39.425 --> 02:06:41.894
CITED. THANK YOU. MR MCCARTY.

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:44.129
SURE I HAVE TO GO. FOR CAL

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:46.799
RECYCLE. ONE ON THAT CHART THAT

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:48.467
YOU SHOWED ABOUT RECYCLING

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:50.569
RATES THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO.

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.871
I DON'T. WELL FIRST OF ALL

02:06:52.938 --> 02:06:54.340
THANKS FOR THE PRESENTATION AND

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:56.208
NONE OF THIS NEWS IS THIS

02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:57.076
UPLIFTING IS KIND OF YOU KNOW

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.577
DEPRESSING FROM ALL

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:00.379
PERSPECTIVES THE- ENVIRONMENTAL

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:02.381
IMPACT THE HEALTH IMPACT AND

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:04.283
THAT JUST THE PRACTICAL IMPACT

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:08.087
A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO FOUR SO.

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:08.821
THE FIRST QUESTION THIS PIECE

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:13.025
IS- IS THAT DO YOU FOLKS FROM

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.793
THE RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE THINK

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:19.565
WAS MORE AS- KIDS. MORE TOP

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.934
THERE WE'RE USING. OR THE

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:23.502
MARKET ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:25.337
CHINA AND SO FORTH ARE NOT

02:07:25.404 --> 02:07:28.774
TAKING- YOU KNOW THE- THE CONT

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:30.709
ESPECIALLY PLAST. AND OVERALL

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.378
RECYCLING IS A BIGGER PICTURE

02:07:32.444 --> 02:07:33.812
TAX WE A HEARING ANOTHER THIS

02:07:33.879 --> 02:07:36.215
WEEK WITH IS FOR CLASS IS THAT

02:07:36.281 --> 02:07:37.983
IS ARE THEY EACH OR ONE MORE

02:07:38.050 --> 02:07:41.620
THAN THE OTHER. YOUR A REALLY

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:44.023
GOOD QUESTION AND- I HAVE A OF

02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:45.891
CHART THAT OFTEN SHOW

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.393
PRESENTATIONS THAT. THAT SO THE

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:49.762
RELAY. BETWEEN ON WAGES AND-

02:07:49.828 --> 02:07:51.530
GENERATION OF THE- AND WHAT WE

02:07:51.597 --> 02:07:52.931
SEE IS THAT WHEN THE ECONOMY IS

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:54.967
GOOD WE GENERATE MORE STUFF.

02:07:55.034 --> 02:07:56.635
AND UP UNTIL PREVIOUSLY THE

02:07:56.702 --> 02:07:58.971
ECONOMY HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD

02:07:59.038 --> 02:08:00.139
SO WE ARE GENERATING A LOT MORE

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:03.642
THINGS- ON. AND A LOT OF THESE

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:04.977
THINGS DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE.

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.278
PLACES FOR THEM TO GO TO GET

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:08.180
RECYCLED SO MUCH OF THAT WAS

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:10.049
DUE TO- THESE INTERNATIONAL

02:08:10.115 --> 02:08:12.351
POLICIES BUT ALSO DUE TO JUST

02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.352
THE SHEER AMOUNT OF THE SHEER

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.720
VOLUME OF MATERIAL GOING INTO

02:08:14.787 --> 02:08:17.122
THE SYSTEM. AND THEN- BECAUSE

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.657
OF THE VOLUME THAT'S GOING INTO

02:08:18.724 --> 02:08:19.291
THE BLUE BINS WE SEE A LOT OF

02:08:19.358 --> 02:08:21.527
THIS CONTAMINATION. WHICH MAKES

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:22.828
THIS MATERIAL EVEN HARDER TO

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.263
RECYCLE SO I THINK TO ANSWER

02:08:24.329 --> 02:08:25.898
YOUR QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:26.665
IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION OF

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:28.033
THESE THINGS. WE'RE GENERATING

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:29.735
<u> LOT OF STUFF ON INTERNATIONAL</u>

02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:31.904
POLICIES ARE COMING DOWN AS-

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:33.939
THE INTERNATIONAL RECYCLING

02:08:34.006 --> 02:08:35.774
COMMUNITY IS GETTING CLEANED UP

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:37.142
AND- WE'RE JUST SEEING THAT

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.311
TRANSLATE INTO. YOU KNOW THE

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.413
REALITY OF LOW RECYCLING RATES

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.915
AS WORK JUST GENERATING MORE

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:44.650
DISPOSING MORE. SO IT'S A BIG

02:08:44.716 --> 02:08:46.819
CHALLENGE. THANK YOU AND SO

02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:51.356
THAT LEADS. TO MY TO MY SECOND

02:08:51.423 --> 02:08:51.957
QUESTION SO. SIR WE CAN TALK

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:54.326
ABOUT- MANUFACTURERS AND- THAT

02:08:54.393 --> 02:08:56.395
ARE MAKING THE PACKAGING AND

02:08:56.462 --> 02:08:58.230
THE- GOODS BUT IT'S ON US

02:08:58.297 --> 02:08:59.064
BECAUSE WE'RE BUYING ALL THAT

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.532
STUFF SO IT'S A TWO PART

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:03.268
SOLUTION A TWO PART ISSUE

02:09:03.335 --> 02:09:03.836
THEY'RE LOOKING I THINK THAT

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:06.004
THE PROBLEM. AND I WOULD ASSUME

02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:07.940
THAT IF YOU HAD THE INDUSTRY

02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:09.241
FOLKS IN HERE RIGHT BEFORE US

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:10.809
TODAY THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:13.445
THAT IT'S A BIG ISSUE- YOU KNOW

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.481
THAT. THAT THAT THERE IS A- NO

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.216
WIN SITUATION FOR THAT FOR THEM

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.051
RIGHT NOW AS WELL. I'M NOT

02:09:19.118 --> 02:09:20.119
TRYING TO PUT THEM OFF THE HOOK

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:22.654
BUT- ARE ARE THERE ANY

02:09:22.721 --> 02:09:26.725
REALISTIC- FRANK SIDES FAR AS-

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:29.194
YOU KNOW WHAT. AMAZON IS DOING

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:30.496
OR WHAT YOU KNOW INDUSTRY IS

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:32.464
DOING ON THE ON THE SINGLE USE

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:33.065
PLASTICS YOU KNOW WITH

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:35.067
DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT ARE

02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:37.669
COMPOSTABLE I KNOW YOU CAN. DO

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:39.938
WE CAN- SQUABBLE OVER WHAT THE

02:09:40.005 --> 02:09:41.907
DEFINITION OF TRULY COMPOSTABLE

02:09:41.974 --> 02:09:44.443
SO. THE OTHER IS THERE ANY YEAH

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.145
IT DOES SOLUTIONS ON ON THE

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:47.146
HORIZON THAT WE COULD HAVE ANY

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:49.047
OPTIMISM ABOUT THIS BESIDES

02:09:49.114 --> 02:09:51.150
LOOKING AT OUR- DEMAND

02:09:51.216 --> 02:09:54.620
PERSPECTIVE. YEAH IT'S A GOOD

02:09:54.686 --> 02:09:56.255
QUESTION AND- CAL RECYCLE NEED

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:57.589
WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS ALL THE

02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:59.791
TIME AND THERE'S A LOT OF. US

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:01.493
ON REALLY GREAT AFTER COMING

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.662
FROM INDUSTRY FROM RECYCLED

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:05.063
CONTENT GOALS TO ACTUAL

02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:07.833
RECYCLABILITY GOALS AND- YOU

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.334
KNOW PACKAGING DESIGNERS AND

02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.435
PRODUCT DESIGNERS THAT ARE

02:10:10.502 --> 02:10:11.770
THINKING MORE ABOUT END OF LIFE

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:14.473
PRODUCTS. BUT AS WE'RE SEEING

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.974
FROM THE DATA THAT THAT I'VE

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.776
SHOWN THAT RUSH HAS SHOWN THE

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:18.744
NUMBER THE OTHER SPEAKERS.

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:19.878
SHOWN IS THAT WE'RE JUST NOT

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:22.848
SEEING THE NEEDLE MOVE YET SO-

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:24.383
THESE ARE ALL GREAT AMBITIOUS

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:26.451
GOALS BUT WE REALLY NEED THE

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:27.853
ROBERT HALF THE ROAD. TO

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.055
REALIZE THAT THE CHANGES THAT

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.089
COULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH THOSE

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:33.425
AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T I DON'T

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:34.626
KNOW THAT WE'LL GET THERE BY

02:10:34.693 --> 02:10:36.128
INDUSTRY INITIATIVES ALONE IT

02:10:36.195 --> 02:10:37.763
SEEMS SUPPORTIVE POLICIES GOING

02:10:37.829 --> 02:10:39.565
TO BE. VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:42.067
HELPING US. REACH THE GOALS

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.035
THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:44.536
EXAMPLE BY TWENTY TWENTY WE

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:46.838
WERE SUPPOSED TO PER EIGHTY

02:10:46.905 --> 02:10:48.640
THREE FORTY ONE RECYCLE 75% OF

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:49.241
ALL MATERIAL WE'RE GENERATING

02:10:49.308 --> 02:10:52.077
IN THE STATE AND- AT 37% AND

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:52.678
TWENTY NINETEEN WERE FAR FROM

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:54.913
THAT SO. IT'S GOING TO TAKE-

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.316
COMMITMENT BY INDUSTRY- AS WELL

02:10:57.382 --> 02:10:59.484
AS SUPPORT OF POLICIES FOR US

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:01.486
TO REALLY. GET TO WHERE WE WANT

02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:02.955
TO GO BUT YES INDUSTRIES DOING

02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:04.856
QUITE A BIT YEAH I GUESS WHAT

02:11:04.923 --> 02:11:06.225
I'M LOOKING AT IS THAT WELL

02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:09.261
FIRST OF ALL. I DON'T- SUPPORT

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.296
THE NOTION THAT WE CAN LIVE

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:12.631
IT'S ALL INDUSTRY THEY'RE GOING

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:13.832
TO SOLVE THIS WILL SOLVE THE

02:11:13.899 --> 02:11:15.534
PROBLEM I THINK. TWENTY THIRTY

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:16.702
YEARS AGO AS WE SAID EARLIER

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:18.370
THEY SET UP. JUST RECYCLE

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:19.605
EVERYTHING'S GOOD POINT THEY A

02:11:19.671 --> 02:11:21.106
BLUE PANTS UP THAT'S NOT

02:11:21.173 --> 02:11:22.975
WORKING SO CLEARLY WE HAVE A

02:11:23.041 --> 02:11:25.677
WALL. AND FEDERAL POLICY AND

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:27.346
STATE POLICY BUT I GUESS I

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:28.914
GUESS I'M WHAT I'M WHAT I'M

02:11:28.981 --> 02:11:30.916
WONDERING IS. YOU KNOW ARE

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:32.818
THERE IT SEEMS THAT SOMEBODY IF

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.720
THEY CAME UP WITH THE PRODUCTS

02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:36.088
AND I MENTIONED THIS THE OTHER

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:37.456
DAY AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IF

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:38.624
IT'S ACCURATE BUT YOU KNOW

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.058
PEOPLE WHO ARE PUTTING PEOPLE

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:43.428
TO THE- TO THE- YOU KNOW. HAD A

02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:45.030
SPACER. ON ALL THE TECHNOLOGY

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:46.465
WE HAVE YOU THINK THAT SOMEBODY

02:11:46.531 --> 02:11:48.033
WOULD COME UP WITH SOME.

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:50.002
BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT AND THEY

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:56.875
COULD JUST. MAKE OUT YOU KNOW

02:11:56.942 --> 02:11:57.809
TURN ON THE UPSIDE ECONOMIC OF

02:11:57.876 --> 02:11:59.211
THAT SO. IS THERE ANYTHING I

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:00.746
THERE IN THE- THAT HAS AN

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:02.014
ALTERNATIVE. TO PLASTIC THAT WE

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.816
THINK IS A- IT'S HARD QUESTION

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:06.685
TO ANSWER GIVE ON. THE AMOUNT

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:07.719
OF DIFFERENT. THAT ARE BEING

02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:09.855
INTRODUCED RIGHT NOW SO ON YOU

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:11.890
KNOW SOME INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:13.692
ARE MOVING FROM PLASTIC TO

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:15.827
FIBER. BUT THERE'S CHALLENGES

02:12:15.894 --> 02:12:16.862
WITH THE FIBER RECYCLING MARKET

02:12:16.928 --> 02:12:19.998
TO- YOU KNOW COMPOSED ABILITY

02:12:20.065 --> 02:12:22.067
IN FACT WOULD DEGRADE ABILITY.

02:12:22.134 --> 02:12:24.136
ARE ARE CHALLENGING IN HOW THEY

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.570
ACTUALLY BEHAVE IN THESE

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:26.738
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND IF

02:12:26.805 --> 02:12:28.373
THEY'RE SORTED CORRECTLY AND

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.175
ARE WASTE INFRASTRUCTURE SO ALL

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:32.311
THAT TO SAY IS THAT- INNOVATION

02:12:32.377 --> 02:12:34.012
IS HAPPENING AND IT'S EXCITING

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:36.148
BUT- THERE ISN'T A SILVER

02:12:36.214 --> 02:12:37.783
BULLET TO GET US THERE I MEAN

02:12:37.849 --> 02:12:39.184
REALLY WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS

02:12:39.251 --> 02:12:40.819
IS ON. WASTE REDUCTION AND THEN

02:12:40.886 --> 02:12:43.088
IDENTIFYING WITH INNOVATION HOW

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.890
THAT FITS INTO OUR EXISTING

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:46.892
SYSTEM OR IF THERE ARE GOING TO

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:48.293
BE NEW SYSTEMS WHAT BEHAVIOR

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:49.328
CHANGE LOOKS LIKE ON THE

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:50.929
CONSUMER SIDE. TO MAKE SURE

02:12:50.996 --> 02:12:52.064
THOSE GET MATERIALS ARE GOING

02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:53.598
TO THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE THEY

02:12:53.665 --> 02:12:55.000
WON'T BEHAVE CREEK CRACKLY IN

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:56.868
OUR SYSTEMS. IF THEY'RE GOING

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:57.936
TO THE WRONG PLACE SO FOR

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:59.638
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW COMBUSTIBLE

02:12:59.705 --> 02:13:01.907
PLASTICS ARE ARE INNOVATIVE AND

02:13:01.973 --> 02:13:03.208
EXCITING BUT IF THEY'RE NOT

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.177
ACTUALLY. GOING TO COMPOST AND

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:07.179
WILL THEY CONTAMINATE PLASTIC

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:09.247
RECYCLING STREAM SO IT'S- IT'S

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:11.583
A SYSTEMATIC- CHALLENGE BUT I

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:14.653
THINK THAT- WE CAN DO A BETTER

02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:20.225
JOB OF HARMONIZING. THESE.

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:20.792
MATERIALS THAT ARE COMING IN

02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:22.461
WITH. I MERGING TECH. TO US

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:25.430
THERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:13:25.497 --> 02:13:27.766
VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:31.002
QUESTIONS FOR- BOTH- MR KENNEDY

02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:33.238
AND MR AND MS- CONVALESCE AND

02:13:33.305 --> 02:13:34.740
EITHER ONE OR BOTH OR NEITHER

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:35.741
OF YOU ARE WELCOME TO ANSWER

02:13:35.807 --> 02:13:37.442
THESE ARE KIND OF JUST. KIND OF

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.144
THROWN OUT THERE FOR YOU- THE

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.645
FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:13:40.712 --> 02:13:42.447
MONETARY IMPACTS OF DEALING

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.648
WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION ON

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:45.851
LOCALITIES AND ON COUNTIES. AND

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:46.351
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE

02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:48.120
DIFFERENT IN EACH COUNTY. BUT

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:50.322
DO YOU HAVE ANY GENERAL IDEAS

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:51.223
OF WHAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT IS

02:13:51.289 --> 02:13:54.292
ON. MUNICIPALITIES AND HOW THEY

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.027
PAY FOR IT HOW DO THEY DEAL

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:58.930
WITH THOSE IMPACTS. WHOEVER HE

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:01.733
WANTS TO JUST TO START. OR NOT

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:06.638
IT'S FINE TO. I MEAN ALL ALL

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:08.240
TAKE A FIRST STAB-

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:09.474
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE

02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:11.143
INFORMATION TODAY SO I CAN TRY

02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:13.812
AND DO SOME RESEARCH- I GOT

02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:15.046
SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:17.149
ABOUT HOW WE'RE HELPING TO

02:14:17.215 --> 02:14:20.285
FACILITATE SOME OF THE ORGANIC-

02:14:20.352 --> 02:14:21.586
GRASSROOTS CLEAN UP EFFORTS

02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:23.121
THAT EXIST OUT THERE AND SOME

02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:25.724
OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- WE'RE

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.592
SEEING IT FOR JUST NORMAL LATER

02:14:27.659 --> 02:14:28.527
ONE OF THE ENCOURAGING THINGS

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:30.962
WAS I. I HEARD ABOUT IT- FOR

02:14:31.029 --> 02:14:32.898
RECREATIONAL FISHERS AS WELL

02:14:32.964 --> 02:14:34.533
WHERE FISHING LINES ARE OUT

02:14:34.599 --> 02:14:35.300
THERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND

02:14:35.367 --> 02:14:37.302
WATERWAYS- AND THEY'RE BEING

02:14:37.369 --> 02:14:38.437
TAKEN CARE OF BY FISHERS OUT

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:39.971
THERE TOO SO I CAN GO BACK AND

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:41.306
TRY AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH WE'RE

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.108
DEVOTING TO THOSE I KNOW WE DO

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.610
RECEIVE SOME- VERY VERY VERY

02:14:45.677 --> 02:14:47.579
MODEST FUNDING FROM THE STATE

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:49.548
THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS. TO

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:51.583
HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THOSE

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:53.151
GOALS BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:54.186
WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:56.021
OBJECTIVES RIGHT AND THERE'S

02:14:56.087 --> 02:14:58.089
THE COSTS OF LITTER THEN

02:14:58.156 --> 02:14:59.891
THERE'S ALSO THE COST OF THE

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:02.494
LANDFILLS THEMSELVES SURE RIGHT

02:15:02.561 --> 02:15:04.029
AND I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.630
ON THAT AS WELL I MEAN ALL

02:15:05.697 --> 02:15:07.699
THOSE COSTS ARE BASICALLY

02:15:07.766 --> 02:15:09.568
PASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS IN OUR

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:12.103
COMMUNITIES- EITHER THROUGH THE

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:14.940
GATE FEES OR- YOU KNOW THERE

02:15:15.006 --> 02:15:16.107
ARE VERY BILLING MECHANISMS

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:21.646
THAT ARE USED IN THE TOURISTIC.

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:22.347
RIGHT BECAUSE SOMETIMES

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:23.782
SOMETHING HEAR FROM. QUITE A

02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:25.050
BIT YEAH GONNA I'M GONNA GO TO

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:27.786
THIS- MISS AND- OF THE THAT.

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.488
YOU KNOW IF FOR THEIR REGULATED

02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:31.490
MORE HIGHLY THERE ASK TO SWITCH.

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:32.958
A MORE EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OR TO

02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:34.159
DO MORE STEWARDSHIP THAT

02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:35.093
THEY'LL BE COSTS THAT ARE

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.395
PASSED ALONG TO CONSUMERS. AS

02:15:37.462 --> 02:15:38.029
THOUGH THEY'RE NOT ALREADY

02:15:38.096 --> 02:15:39.631
BEARING THOSE COSTS IN THE CASE

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:40.665
OF CONSUMERS THEY HAVE THE

02:15:40.732 --> 02:15:42.234
CHOICE. OF WHETHER TO BUY A

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.336
PRODUCT OR NOT. BUT WHEN YOU'RE

02:15:44.402 --> 02:15:45.303
TALKING ABOUT COSTS THAT ARE

02:15:45.370 --> 02:15:46.605
SUPPOSED TO DEAL WITH THE

02:15:46.671 --> 02:15:48.173
MEDICATION TO DEAL WITH THAT.

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.774
THE POLLUTION CLEAN UP THE

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:51.476
LANDFILLS THAT SPREAD ACROSS

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:52.677
EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT OF A

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:55.313
COMMUNITY WHETHER THEY BUY

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:56.715
PLASTIC PRODUCTS ARE NOT. SO

02:15:56.781 --> 02:15:57.849
WHAT ABOUT THE CASE OF L. A.

02:15:57.916 --> 02:16:00.018
COUNTY WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:00.919
THOSE COSTS ARE AND ARE THEY

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:02.754
INCREASING OR DECREASING AND

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:04.022
HOW MUCH OR- HOW MUCH IS AN

02:16:04.089 --> 02:16:05.524
ORDINARY PERSON PAYING TOWARDS

02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:11.196
THIS PROBLEM. YES ALL ALL THAT

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:12.831
JUST KIND OF ECHO I DON'T HAVE

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:13.965
EXACT NUMBERS ANY BE HAPPY TO

02:16:14.032 --> 02:16:15.467
FOLLOW UP TO FIND SOME MORE

02:16:15.534 --> 02:16:17.569
SPECIFICS- I THINK. YOU KNOW I

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:19.604
CITED ONE STUDY THAT SHOWED-

02:16:19.671 --> 02:16:20.739
IMPACTS ON THE ORDER OF

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:22.507
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR SAN

02:16:22.574 --> 02:16:23.842
DIEGO AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:24.709
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:16:24.776 --> 02:16:25.744
ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF OUR

02:16:25.810 --> 02:16:27.979
LARGER CITIES IN THE COUNTY-

02:16:28.046 --> 02:16:29.548
THAT BUT YOU KNOW IT IS. IT'S A

02:16:29.614 --> 02:16:31.283
RELATIVELY NEW ISSUE WHEN IT'S

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:33.518
IN FLUX SO I THINK WE'RE STILL

02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:34.886
KIND OF WAITING TO SEE EXACTLY

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:35.720
WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO

02:16:35.787 --> 02:16:37.322
BE AND ON REPAIRS I WOULD JUST

02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:38.957
ECHO THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:40.525
HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.494
ASIDE FROM- EITHER THE

02:16:42.561 --> 02:16:44.296
JURISDICTION OR THE RATE PAYERS

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:45.130
AT THIS POINT SO THOSE WILL

02:16:45.196 --> 02:16:47.966
FALL ON. RESIDENTS ULTIMATELY

02:16:48.033 --> 02:16:49.935
WHAT MIGHT I SUGGEST THAT. AS

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:52.671
YOU DO YOUR UTILITY BILLS AND

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:55.040
YOU HAVE YOUR FEES. BUT IF YOU

02:16:55.106 --> 02:16:56.708
FOUND A WAY TO SPIT OUT. A

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.010
PLASTIC DISPOSAL MITIGATION FEE

02:16:59.077 --> 02:17:01.079
ON THAT BILL. THAT THERE MIGHT

02:17:01.146 --> 02:17:03.048
BE ANOTHER REASON WHY RESIDENTS

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:05.150
WOULD SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:07.252
GETTING THIS UNDER CONTROL. AND

02:17:07.319 --> 02:17:11.122
TRULY UNDERSTAND. THE COSTS OF

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:13.725
THOSE CHEAP. DOLLAR STORE. TOYS

02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:15.226
IN PRAGUE. THAT ARE SINGLE USE

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:16.962
OR THAT ARE CEAPLY MADE AND-

02:17:17.028 --> 02:17:19.130
BECOME ESSENTIALLY SINGLE USE.

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:22.167
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HUGE COST-

02:17:22.233 --> 02:17:23.201
DOWN THE ROAD TO THOSE VERY

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:24.903
SAME PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM CAN

02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:26.471
NOT AFFORD IT STILL BE GREAT

02:17:26.538 --> 02:17:28.673
JUST FIND A WAY TO. PARSE THAT

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:31.309
OUT. ON A BILL SOMEWHERE MAYBE

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:32.644
THAT'S AN IDEA FOR LEGISLATION.

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.746
AND IT MIGHT MY NEXT QUESTION

02:17:34.813 --> 02:17:37.916
IS- I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:39.417
FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:42.153
WHAT- WHAT ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE-

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.188
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE HAVE BEEN THE

02:17:43.254 --> 02:17:46.791
MOST AFFECTED- IF ANY IN

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:52.263
DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES. AND

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:53.031
IF THE ANSWER IS NO NO YOU

02:17:53.098 --> 02:17:54.599
DON'T KNOW THAT'S FINE TOO YEAH

02:17:54.666 --> 02:18:01.940
JUST JUST GO AHEAD. I MEAN

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.008
ECHOING WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.876
AND I WENT IS SO WE FROM

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:06.111
CALORIE CYCLE THAT I DON'T

02:18:06.177 --> 02:18:07.145
THINK ANYBODY'S. YOU KNOW

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:08.279
CERTAINLY FOUND THE SOLUTION TO

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:10.682
THE ISSUES- I JUST ECHO AGAIN

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:12.150
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.852
WE HAD ENORMOUS SUCCESS WITH

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:16.788
WAS THE PLASTIC BAG BAN- AND

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:19.090
THAT WAS- SORT OF A COMBINATION

02:18:19.157 --> 02:18:21.326
OF POLICY DRIVING. BEHAVIOR

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:23.495
CHANGE WHICH AND DISH AND HAS-

02:18:23.561 --> 02:18:25.997
YOU KNOW DRIVEN- INDUSTRY TO

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:28.833
SORT OF ADJUST SO- THAT WAS

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.435
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL I THINK

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:32.103
THERE WAS THE FIRST YEAR AFTER

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:33.838
THAT WAS PASSED. THERE WAS

02:18:33.905 --> 02:18:35.407
SOMETHING LIKE OVER 90%

02:18:35.473 --> 02:18:38.109
REDUCTION IN- OBSERVE A LITTER

02:18:38.176 --> 02:18:41.146
OF PLASTIC BAGS SO- I THINK IT

02:18:41.212 --> 02:18:42.781
DOES SHOW THAT POLICIES AIMED

02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:45.016
AROUND SOURCE REDUCTION- CAN

02:18:45.083 --> 02:18:47.485
REALLY. CAN REALLY- IMPACT

02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:49.187
THESE THINGS. AND ONE OF THE

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:50.021
BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU

02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:51.222
HAVE WHEN YOU TRY TO ENACT

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:53.191
POLICIES LIKE PLASTIC BAG BAN

02:18:53.258 --> 02:18:55.660
OR ANY OTHER POLICIES THAT

02:18:55.727 --> 02:18:58.563
YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THIS IS FOR

02:18:58.630 --> 02:19:00.398
EITHER OF YOU. WELL I'D LIKE TO

02:19:00.465 --> 02:19:02.233
STEP BACK JUST A COUPLE OF THE

02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:04.202
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK- THE SO.

02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:06.938
WITH YOUR YOUR PROMPT ABOUT-

02:19:07.005 --> 02:19:08.540
PUTTING A FEE ON RESIDENTS OF

02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:10.008
BILLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:11.609
SHOW THE COST OF RECYCLING I

02:19:11.676 --> 02:19:12.043
KNOW THERE ARE SOME

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.311
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE STARTED

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:15.180
DOING THAT- SOME JURISDICTIONS

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:16.648
AS THE RENEGOTIATING THEIR

02:19:16.715 --> 02:19:18.550
FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS- THERE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:20.585
COST. INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:22.754
NATIONAL SWORD. WE'RE RECYCLING

02:19:22.821 --> 02:19:24.189
IS L. A. COUNTY AND POWER CYCLE

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:25.790
POINTED OUT USED TO BRING IN

02:19:25.857 --> 02:19:27.358
MONIES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS-

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:28.593
NOW IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE AND

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.261
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TO

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:31.563
SUBSIDIZE THOSE EFFORTS TO THE

02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:33.364
RATEPAYERS. SO WE'RE SEEING

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:37.202
MORE ON BILL. FLAGS THAT THAT

02:19:37.268 --> 02:19:40.238
EXISTS- AND RECYCLING FEES ARE

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:42.474
BEING IMPOSED- FOR SOME MORE

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:44.509
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE PRODUCTS WE

02:19:44.576 --> 02:19:45.744
ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER GATE

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:47.412
FEES FOR THOSE MATERIALS- OR

02:19:47.479 --> 02:19:50.815
TIPPING FEE- AND- AS FAR AS-

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:52.117
YOU KNOW. WHAT WORKS WE WERE

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:54.486
REALLY HOPEFUL FOR LAST YEAR'S

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.621
SOLUTION SB THIRTY FOUR EIGHTY

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:59.124
TEN EIGHTY- TO CREATE. SHE

02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:01.359
PARTNER WITH ME FOR. SO THAT WE

02:20:01.426 --> 02:20:04.195
CAN REALLY HAVE EVERYONE HAVING

02:20:04.262 --> 02:20:05.096
TO SIT AT THE TABLE TO DEAL

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.965
WITH PLASTIC WASTE AND

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:13.705
RECYCLING. AND RECYCLABILITY

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:17.408
ESPECIALLY. THANK THANK YOU CAL

02:20:17.475 --> 02:20:18.109
DO YOU HAVE ANY COME AOUT

02:20:18.176 --> 02:20:23.414
BARRIERS TO HAVE OR AND I PAUL.

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:27.085
YEAH I MEAN IT JUST AGAIN

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.353
LOOKING AT SORT OF THE FOOD

02:20:28.419 --> 02:20:30.255
SERVICE WARE ORDINANCE I ONE OF

02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:31.189
THE BIGGEST CONCERNS ARE THE

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:34.959
ECONOMIC IMPACTS- SO IT'S HI

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:36.628
THERE THERE IS JUST AND THERE

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:38.696
IS STILL- A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.398
ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT WILL BE

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:42.033
AND- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:44.302
REALLY SEEN ANY- NEGATIVE

02:20:44.369 --> 02:20:46.871
IMPACTS- FROM- AND THE

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:47.572
EXPERIENCE OF OTHER

02:20:47.639 --> 02:20:48.973
JURISDICTIONS BUT THAT'S

02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:50.341
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:20:50.408 --> 02:20:53.344
OBSTACLES- AND- YOU KNOW

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:55.213
CERTAINLY WE HAVE. WE

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.681
DEFINITELY GET PUSHBACK FROM

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:59.250
THE INDUSTRY AS WELL- I'M

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:00.685
LOOKING AT THESE THINGS VERY

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:03.054
SIMILAR AG COMMENTS THAT YOU

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:05.423
THAT YOU HAVE- STATED IN TERMS

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:08.326
OF- THAT COSTS AND HOW THOSE

02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:10.728
COSTS WILL IMPACT CONSUMERS AS

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:13.131
WELL- LIKE I MENTIONED THE

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:14.699
STUDY THAT WE HAD UCLA DID

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:18.203
REALLY KIND OF- YOU KNOW TOOK

02:21:18.269 --> 02:21:19.604
APART SOME OF THOSE ARGUMENTS

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:21.973
AND MADE US FEEL THAT THEY WERE

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.808
AND- WE'RE TO ISSUE AND ALSO

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:25.743
HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT AGAIN

02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:27.679
AS YOU MENTIONED- CHIU FRIEDMAN

02:21:27.745 --> 02:21:29.347
THAT- THESE COSTS ARE BEING

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:31.816
BORNE BY SOMEONE- IT'S MAYBE

02:21:31.883 --> 02:21:34.085

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. AND

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:44.896
MY LAST QUESTION IS A LOT OF

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.631
TIMES THE STATE COMES IN AND

02:21:46.698 --> 02:21:48.066
SORT OF PREAMPS THE LOCALS BY

SOME OF THE LOCAL REGULATIONS-

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:58.409
IS THAT IS THAT HELPFUL OR IS

02:21:58.476 --> 02:21:59.711
IT WOULD YOU RATHER THAT WE

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:00.712
COMPLETELY STAY OUT OF THE

TRASH BUSINESS OR IS IT HELP

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:05.583
WHEN WE COME IN AND TRY TO DO-

02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:07.385

02:22:10.588 --> 02:22:11.656
THAT'S A REALLY BROAD QUESTIONS

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:12.924
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST GIVE SOME

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:14.525
EXAMPLES OF WHEN IT'S HELPED

02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:15.326
WHEN IT'S HURT THAT KIND OF

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:17.328
THING. AND BY THE WAY HELPED

EXPERIENCES. UP FOR MY-

02:34:57.121 --> 02:34:58.122
PERSPECTIVE IS SOMEONE WHO

COMES OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

02:34:59.556 --> 02:35:01.458
AS WELL AS NO LEGISLATOR I

02:35:01.525 --> 02:35:02.693
THINK THE PUBLIC REALLY DOES

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.029
NOT UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.897
AND- TRUE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

02:35:06.964 --> 02:35:08.465
OF THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:12.469
PRODUCT- BEING PLASTIC. AND WE

02:35:12.536 --> 02:35:13.504
HAVE BEEN SOLD A REAL BILL OF

02:35:13.570 --> 02:35:17.608
GOODS THAT RECYCLING IS- THE-

02:35:17.675 --> 02:35:19.877
SOLUTION AND THAT IF THERE IS

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:21.145
PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN IT'S

02:35:21.211 --> 02:35:23.213
BECAUSE OF CONSUMERS OR- OR

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.982
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LITTERING.

02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:27.184
AND TRULY IT'S- A SYSTEM THAT

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.485
JUST WAS NEVER SET UP TO DEAL

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:31.622
WITH WITH. A PRODUCT THAT IS

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:32.222
VERY DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE AND

02:35:32.289 --> 02:35:34.391
EXPENSIVE. AND THE SOLUTION IS

02:35:34.458 --> 02:35:36.894
TO. TO FIND WAYS OF REDUCING

02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:39.830
IT. AND WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THE

02:35:39.897 --> 02:35:42.666
POLITICAL WILL. TO DO THAT AND

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.101
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE I THINK

02:35:44.168 --> 02:35:45.335
THE PUBLIC REALLY UNDERSTANDING

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:46.036
THOSE IMPACTS AND THEY'RE

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:47.404
BEGINNING TO I THINK OUR

02:35:47.471 --> 02:35:48.772
CHILDREN UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:50.240
AT THIS POINT A LOT MORE THAN

02:35:50.307 --> 02:35:52.209
THEIR PARENTS DO. AB BUT IT'S

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:53.644
UP TO US TO BE THE PARENTS IN

02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:55.446
THE ADULT IN THE ROOM AS WELL.

02:35:55.512 --> 02:35:56.780
AND TO BECAUSE MAKE SURE THAT

02:35:56.847 --> 02:35:58.916
CALIFORNIA SETS THE EXAMPLE OF

02:35:58.982 --> 02:35:59.550
WHAT BEING THAT OF WOULD GOOD

02:35:59.616 --> 02:36:02.419
STEWARDSHIP IS. SO I HOPE THAT-

02:36:02.486 --> 02:36:04.288
WE ALL CAN WORK THIS YEAR.
