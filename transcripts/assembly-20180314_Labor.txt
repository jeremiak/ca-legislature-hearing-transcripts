TO EDUCATE EVERYONE ON WHAT VALLEY FEVER IS HOW MANY FAMILIES IS AFFECTED UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE I BELIEVE I GAVE EACH OF YOU THE YOUR SPECIFIC COUNTY NUMBERS ABOUT HOW MANY CASES OF ACTUALLY. BEEN COUNTED IN YOUR IN YOUR COUNTIES BUT WITH THAT SAID WE ALSO KNOW THAT CDC ESTIMATES A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CASES GO UNREPORTED EVERY YEAR. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE VALLEY FEVER DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP. THOSE FAMILIES AND THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE. YOUR RECOMMENDATION. FOR DISPOSABLES FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CELIS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED EFFICACY I KNOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES AT LEAST THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO IT. OF THE BILL DOES HAVE. AYE RECOMMENDATION FROM THIS CHAIR. AND. WE WILL BE ASKING THE SERGEANTS TO CONTINUE CALLING THE MEMBERS THAT ARE ABSENT SO THAT WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THIS MATTER RIGHT AWAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIR RECOGNIZES ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMOS PRESIDENT WE WELCOME YOU SOME A MEMBER LIMON PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. THINK YOU CHAIR LOOKING YOU MEMBERS THAT. MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING FOR BOTH THE MOTHER AND THE BABY DESPITE THE MANY ESTABLISHED BENEFITS THE PERCENTAGES OF AMERICAN WOMEN. THAT EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFEED THEIR BABIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS REMAINS LOW. WOMEN WHO WORK OUTSIDE. THE HOME ARE LESS LIKELY TO INITIATE BREAST FEEDING TO TEND TO BREASTFEED OR SHORTER LENGTHS OF TIMES THAN WOMEN WHO ARE EMPLOYED OUTSIDE OF THE HOME THE WOMAN WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. WOMEN FREQUENTLY CITE AND SUPPORTIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT CLEAN A LACK OF PRIVACY IN A LACK OF HYGIENIC SPACES AS A REASON FOR DISCONTINUING BREASTFEEDING. WITH MORE AND MORE WOMEN WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME THIS PRESENTS A REAL PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE SPACE MADE AVAILABLE FOR WOMEN TO EXPRESS TO EXPRESS BREAST MILK IN THE WORKPLACE IS NOT A BATHROOM. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IS A SMALL CHANGE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR WORKING MOTHERS IN TWO WAYS ONE. ADELINE ST STATUE WITH FEDERAL LAW SAFEGUARDING THE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION AGAINST ANY CHANGES TO THE ACA SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE STATUES ARE ALREADY FEDERALLY IN PLACE. IT HELPS TO REDUCE TO IT HELPS TO REDUCE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER THAT PREVENTS WOMEN FROM CONTINUING TO BREASTFEED UPON RETURNING TO WORK BY ENSURING THAT THERE IS A PRIVATE AND CLEAN SPACE AVAILABLE. TO EXPRESS BREASTMILK. TODAY AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH MITCHELL POCKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH ADDS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLY MON PREVIOUSLY STATED ENSURES THAT NURSING MOMS HAVE A SPACE OTHER THAN ABOUT HIM TO EXPRESS MILK ONCE THEY RETURN TO WORK. IN TWENTY TEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AMENDED THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT TO ADD NEW WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR NURSING MOTHERS. REQUIRING THE PROVISION OF A LOCATION FOR EXPRESS BUS BREAST MILK OTHER THAN A BATHROOM THAT IS NEARLY EMPLOYEES WORK AREA SHIELDED FROM VIEW AND FREE FROM THE INTRUSION OF COWORKERS AND PUBLIC. GIVEN THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SURROUNDING THE ACA WE BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WORKING MOMS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO A SANITARY LACTATION SPACE. SHOULD THE FEDERAL LAW GOVERNING THIS IMPORTANT PROTECTION EVER BE AMENDED OR REPEALED. BY NATURE PUBLIC RESTROOMS ARE UNHYGIENIC LOCATIONS IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOOD FOR AN INFANT. THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MULTIPLE TYPES OF BACTERIA PRESENT ON ALL SURFACES INCLUDING THINGS AND COUNTER TOPS. I THINK THAT MOST FOLKS WOULD NOT WILLINGLY CHOOSE TO PREPARE MEAL IN THE BATHROOM. AND WE BELIEVE THE SAME STANDARD SHOULD APPLY. TO NURSING MOMS. WITH THAT THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WE CALL FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES AT ON IN SUPPORT BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GONNA QUICKLY ESTABLISHED A ROLL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THURMAN HERE. FLORA. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. JONES SAWYER PRESIDENT KALRA. MCCARTY MELENDEZ. A QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED THANK YOU. BUT THOSE WITH AN ADD ON SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS DEREK CLINICS ON BEHALF OF SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE PROBABLY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MY INGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT SPENCER WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS DISTRICT NINE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I AT THIS TIME ANY OPPOSITION IT I DIDN'T KNOW MARK CURTIS WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE HERE I'M JUST ON OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM ESTABLISHES A NEW MANDATE REGARDING LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS WELL BY WHEREBY AN EMPLOYER MUST MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO PROVIDE A LOCATION OTHER THAN A BATHROOM FOR EMPLOYEES TO EXPRESS NOT. AND THIS MIGHT CREATE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP FOR EMPLOYERS THAT SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR LOCATION OTHER THAN A BATHROOM. OUR MEMBER SUPPORT NEW MOTHERS AND THEIR TRANSITION BACK TO WORK WE WANT TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION AS EASY IN PA AS POSSIBLE BUT FOR SOME EMPLOYERS THIS WOULD SIMPLY. CREATE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY AND EXPENSE FOR EXAMPLE A STANDALONE DRIVE THROUGH COFFEE SHOP SIMPLY MIGHT NOT HAVE ANOTHER LOCATION FOR AN EMPLOYEE OTHER THAN A BATHROOM THAT PROVIDES THERE AND REQUIRED PRIVACY FOR THIS TYPE ACTED. THE OTHER STATES THAT THE BILL WILL CODIFY FEDERAL LAW THE FEDERAL LAW ACTUALLY INCLUDES AND HARDSHIP EXEMPTION FOR LACTATION ACCOMMODATION ADDITIONALLY AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE. A DEFINITION FOR BATHROOM AND THIS MIGHT UNINTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED PLACES SUCH AS A WOMAN'S LOUNGE THAT'S ATTACHED TO A BATHROOM HAS COUCHES AND CHAIRS AND OTHER PLACES FOR A PERSON TO EXPRESS MILK. IN A LOCATION THAT'S CONSIDERED REASONABLE WITHOUT A CLEAR DEFINITION OF A BATHROOM THE SPACES COULD BE REARDED AS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE COMBINATION PLACING A FURTHER BURDEN ON AN EMPLOYER FOR TO MAKE THIS KIND OF ACCOMMODATION. WITH CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS SUCH AS PROVIDING A DEFINITION FOR BATHROOM AND ALLOWING FOR A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION FOR EMPLOYERS THAT SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR THIS TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION. WE WOULD AND. WE WOULD UNDERSTAND AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX COULD THEN ACHIEVE ITS GOAL PROVIDING SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR EMPLOYEES TO EXPRESS IN THAT PRESS MONTH WITHOUT OVER BURDENING AND PLAYERS WITH AN UNREASONABLE MANDATE. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO COLLABORATE ON THE AMENDMENTS. THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. TRACY SALOMON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO POSING WITH AMENDED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WHERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. BRITNEY SAID SERVICEABLE JUSTICE ASSOCIATION ALSO POSE MUST AMENDED FOR THE REASON. REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UP TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SIMILAR CALLER THANK YOU I'M. A THANK YOU SHARON THANK YOU MEMBER LIMON FOR BRINGING THIS A BILL FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT. CODE ALREADY ALLOWS FOR REGIONAL COMMENDATIONS FOR A FOR EMPLOYERS. AND SO I I CERTAINLY RESPECT THE CONCERNS BUT I THINK THAT. THAT WAY IT CAN BE MANAGED THROUGH CURRENT. THE CURRENT CODE UP IN ADDITION I REALLY APPRECIATE BRING THIS FORWARD IS NOT SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT MEN ALWAYS THINK ABOUT BUT. HE CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I WAS A CITY HALL. INTO A NEW CITY HALL SOUNDS A COUPLE SILICON VALLEY WE JUST HIT REFRESH OF A MEETING AND SOMEONE ASKED ME WHERE THE NURSING ROOM WAS AND I WAS EMBARRASSED LED THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE ONE. I'VE HAD TO CLOSE THE BLINDS AND CLOSE MY DOOR LAWLER USE MY BUT I OFFICE BUT SOME IS GOING TO THAT. I PUT FORWARD LIPS CITY LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE IT. NOT ONLY SI HARB OTHER SLEEP CITIES LIKE CHILDREN'S COUNTY MUSEUM HAPPY HOLLOW PARK ZOO WILL BE DIDN'T. I HAVE IT AND AND SO WE CAN BE RENT FOR A BATON SO I LEARNED AFTER THAT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. UP AND IT REALLY BECAME PART OF MY THOUGHT PROCESS AND SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THAT YOU BRING THIS FLORIDA ENSURING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO THINKING ABOUT. A ABOUT WOMEN QUICKLY THOSE ARE NOT ONLY THAT ARE GOING TO PLACES LIKE THE THE AS AS VISITORS AND GASSED THOSE RETURNING TO THE WORKPLACE. TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUMP AS WELL. SO I'M I LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION. TO PASS A BILL. A MOTION A SECOND IT OF SOME ANOTHER JONES SAWYER. BOMB. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO IS DIRECTOR REALISTIC ISSUE LOS ANGELES WHO WAS INSTRUCTED TO GREAT BUT WHITE. WAS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE NO ONE COMES INTO THE. THE FIRE STATIONS I SAID ONE DAY THERE WILL BE HALF OR YOU WILL BE WOMEN. AND THEY WE WILL NEED LACTATION STATIONS AND WHAT I LEARNED IS ONCE I SAID THAT ONCE I PUT THAT IDEA THAT. YOU DO NEED IT. ARM AND WHY YOU NEED IT AND IT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT. SOMEONE WILL ACTUALLY USE IT IT BECAME VERY EASY FROM THEN ON AND THIS IS MORE FOR. FORUM RESTAURANT OWNERS AND PEOPLE AND CAL CHAMBER WANT YOU EX EMBRACE IT ACCEPTED. ON SAME WOULD WITH A HANDICAP ACCESS TO THE TIMER. INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS SAID WE CAN'T DO HANDICAP ACCESS COULD CAN'T AFFORD IT WE CAN'T DO IT ON BUT WE FOUND WAYS TO WHAT YOU EMBRACE THE IDEA. OF. ACCOMMODATION SPECTACLE OFTEN GREAT IDEAS WILL COME FORTH AND SO I HOPE THAT YOU WORK WITH THEM. DE THE OPPOSITION TO TO HELP THEM. SEE WHERE THIS CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN. THINK BACK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER INSULTS FLETCHER I WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I HAD A WOMEN'S ADVISORY COUNCIL MEETING AND THE DISTRICT AND I'M. WE THOUGHT WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT PAY INEQUITIES OR. ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THEY ALL BROUGHT UP WAS AND BREASTFEEDING WHEN YOU GO BACK TO WORK SO I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IT'S BEEN AWHILE FOR ME M.. AND SO I. AT LIKE TO. REMEMBER THOSE DAYS BUT I AM I A NEW MOMS IN PARTICULAR I THINK I'M FACE IT SO DRAMATICALLY THAT I I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS LEGISLATION. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THE OPPOSITION'S STATEMENT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT FOR THE FUTURE THE PEOPLE DON'T THINK IT'S OKAY. I'M TO SIMPLY HAVE A LOUNGE IN A BATHROOM BECAUSE AND I WAS ACTUALLY A STUDENT AT UCLA LAW SCHOOL WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER. AND THAT IS THE ACCOMMODATIONS I WAS GIVEN. IN THE LOUNGES IN THE BATHROOM LOOKED A LOT LIKE OUR WOMEN'S BATHROOMS HERE WHICH IS. A DIRTY COUCH IN THE SAME ROOM AS A BATHROOM UP AND SO I I THINK I. THAT'S NICE BUT LIKE IF YOU WOULDN'T EAT A SANDWICH SOMEWHERE THAT YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T. BE FORCED TO BREASTFEED YOUR CHILD A PUMP SOMEWHERE. SO THAT I WON ENCOURAGE YOU TO HOLD FAST ON YOUR BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AT SAY NINE I I WOULD ALSO JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AT YOU KNOW IT'S HARD. TO HEAR OF THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY OPPOSITION AND IT JUST FELT LIKE THERE WAS. NO RECOGNITION OF THE SANITARY COUNTY CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN A RACE AND THAT. YOU KNOW THE STATE OF MOST BATHROOMS A WE SEE ANYMORE I DON'T EVEN THINK PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE BATHROOMS LET ALONE EATING IT LITTLE NURSE THEIR CHILD AND SO THANK YOU FOR. BEING FORWARD ON THIS AND THAT IT DOES HAVE THAT YEARS AYE RECOMMENDATION. IF YOU LIKE CLUBS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I FOR THE COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK THANK YOU TO CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND ALL THE SUPPORTERS A THINK THAT. THIS IS AN ISSUE AND THAT DOESN'T JUST IMPACT WOMEN IF WE CARE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH IF WE CARE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR YOUTH THAT THE CHILDREN GROW UP IN A HEALTHY WAY.

AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN TO PROVIDE A TECHNO BANKS TO SENATOR STEINBERG'S SB FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WHICH REQUIRES FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS TO REGISTER THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER. SPECIFICALLY THAT WOULD ENSURE THE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF SP FOUR SEVEN SEVEN BY REQUIRING THAT ALL FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS S ORIGINALLY INTENDED. ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE COMMISSIONER NOT JUST THOSE FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS RECRUIT WORKERS TO THE AGE TO BE BE SUBCATEGORY. AS ESTABLISHED BY S. BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN CURRENT LAW REQUIRES FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS TO REGISTER WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO HIRE REGISTERED A POLICIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDES PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES FOR THOSE FOREIGN WORKERS SOLICITED AND RECRUITED TO WORK TEMPORARILY IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT THEM FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND OTHER LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS. LABOR AND SEX TRAFFICKING CONTINUES TO BE A PERVASIVE ISSUE IN THE SOLICITATION AND HIRING. A FOREIGN WORKERS UNDER ALL BE SIR CATEGORIES. THE OUR SPONSORS OF WORK WITH MANY SUCH INS INDIVIDUALS. GUSTAVO TEMPLE YEAH ALTERADO WAS RECRUITED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE A MATURE CON MEDICAL TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA ON AN H. TWO A. B. SET PICKING STRAWBERRIES. HE AND THE OTHER FOUR HUNDRED WORKERS WERE PART OF THE CASE WERE CHARGED. MORE THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN KICKBACKS RECRUITMENT COSTS PLUS ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR TRAVEL. HE AND HIS CO WORKERS WERE THREATENED WITH BLACKLISTING AND INTIMIDATED BY EMPLOYERS AFTER THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT THESE ABUSES. THIS TIME THE RETALIATION NEEDS TO BE CURBED WITH PROTECTIONS LAID OUT IN S. B. FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN. IN LIMITING THE SCOPE OF S. BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN TO APPLE'S HE'S RECRUITING UNDER THE AGE TO BE BE SIR. THE VAST MAJORITY A TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA REMAIN UNPROTECTED AND SUBJECT TO THE DOCUMENTED ABUSES OF UNSCRUPULOUS AT POLICIES. INSTEAD OF PROTECTING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA AS INTENDED. PROTECTIONS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND TEMPORARY AGE TO BE WORKERS. AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN FULFILL THE INTENT OF SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN. BY MAKING CLEAR THAT ALL FAIR FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE COVERED. WITH ONLY TWO EXCEPTIONS J. ONE VISAS AND TALENT AGENCY RECRUITERS. AS A RESULT. THE BILL WOULD ALIVE A LOT TO COMPORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AT POLICIES RECRUITING WORKERS UNDER ALL BE SICK CATEGORIES WITH TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS ARE COVERED. BUT COVERING ALL FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN WILL ENSURE THAT ALL FOREIGN WORKERS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST WAGE THEFT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OTHER WORKER ABUSES. WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY TESTIMONY ARE MELANIE QUIBUS REPRESENTING THE COALITION AGAINST SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. AS WELL AS DAVID JONES WITH MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG STAFF. WHAT THE FIRST WITNESS? THAT AFTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS MELANIE CUEVAS ON THE PRO BONO LOBBYIST FOR CAP THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING. THE BILL'S SPONSOR AS WELL AS THE NATION'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES. ARE LEGISLATIVE WORK COMES MY BOOTS ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE SO I SUCH I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU ONE DOCUMENTED ABUSE SEVEN EACH TO AB SO SITUATION. A FEW YEARS AGO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THAI WORKERS WERE RECRUITED TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR AGRICULTURE EMPLOYMENT SOME OF THEM HEAD UPWARDS OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND AS A RECRUITMENT THE. WHEN THEY GOT TO UNITED STATES THERE HEAVILY INDEBTED. THEIR RECRUITERS CONFISCATED PASSPORTS. FORCE WORKERS TO LIVE IN RHODE VESTED QUARTERS THE WORK THAT RANCID FOOD AND THE RECORDERS MADERA RECRUITERS THREATENED DEPORTATION IF THE WORKERS COMPLAINED. IT'S CLEAR TO US THAT DESPITE THE CURRENT EXISTING REGULATION OF FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA. FURTHER PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED WHEN A FOREIGN LEADERS ARE CONTRACTED UNDER EACH TO A V. SAYS. AND FACTOR REPORT BY THE CLERK PELORUS PROJECTS STATE THAT I WORK WITH THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE INDUSTRY. ASSOCIATED WITH THE VICTIMS REPORTING LABOR TRAFFICKING ABUSE. I WHILE MANY FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS DO OUT ACT ETHICALLY SOME ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN LABOR TRAFFICKING. AGRICULTURAL WORKERS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER WORK ON ITS HAVE PREVIOUS THAT NEEDS THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED AN SP FOUR SEVEN SEVEN AND IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIRTEEN. BOTH WORKERS AND CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ALIKE WILL BENEFIT FROM ONE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTOR POLICY. I THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE SPONSORED SP FIVE. SIXTEEN WITH SENATOR STEINBERG AND EXIT SUCCESSOR AS BEFORE SEVEN SEVEN WHICH I TRUST THAT GOVERNOR'S FUNDING CONCERNED AND ULTIMATELY WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. HOWEVER WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ON IMPLEMENTING THIS. WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND CLARIFIES THAT ALL THESE THE CATEGORIES EXCEPT FOR JAY ONE AND REGISTER TOWN AGENCIES. ARE COVERED BY THE BILL WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ERRONEOUS PLACEMENT IN STATUTE DOES CREATE SOME CONFUSION AND WE ARE IN FRONT OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE TODAY. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY TECHNICAL FIXES MADE TO CLARIFY THE BILL'S FULL LEGISLATIVE INTENT FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS ONE OF THE ONLY A LOT THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REDUCING HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. CAST ONCE AGAIN ASKS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE ON THIS MEASURE THINK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. YES MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR MAKE SLIGHT CORRECTION OR NOT UNTIL STAFF ON THE LOBBYIST FOR THE CITY'S ECONOMIC YOU ON BEHALF OF I'M HALF BAKED REAL STANDARD. A WE ARE HERE ADMITTED EVERYBODY WORKS FOR DEL STALAG. SO YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THINK THE AUTHOR THIS DOES CLARIFY THE INTENT OF THE OF THE AUTHOR TO OF. I EXTENDED PROTECTIONS TO ALL HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND WORKERS THAT ARE. COME HERE FOR UNDERFUNDED FOREIGN PROGRAMS UP UNFORTUNATELY SACRAMENTO DOES HAVE ANOTHER DISTINCTION IS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM HERE ABOUT. SO IN AS MUCH AS THIS BILL WILL HELP CLOSE THAT GAP AND IN THAT LOOPHOLE. WE'VE WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU A SUPPORT THIS BILL AND PASS IT ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. NICHOLAS THOMAS ON BEHALF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT.

A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE I MATTHEW ON WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE RESPECTIVELY OPPOSED TO AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN. IT'S HEARTBREAKING FRANKLY CARE ABOUT CASES WHERE THERE'S BEEN OF ABUSE OF WORKERS ON ANY CASES THAT WERE A HEARING ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON. ARE FRANKLY ART AGAINST FEDERAL LAW ON THEIR TREATMENT FEES. BEING PROMISED A JOB THAT YOU ARE NOT RECEIVING AND THAT RECEIVING. THE WAGES AND HOURS IN A WRITTEN FORM. ALSO WANTED JUST OUTLAYS SOME OF THAT. ON THE AT THE OUTSET. WE THERE IS A PROGRAM FOR THE TRADE WAS NOT OVERLOOKED DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS FOR AS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH CREATED THE FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING LICENSING PROGRAM. IT WAS SIMPLY NOT INTENDED TO BE COVERED BECAUSE THE LACK OF NECESSITY DO SO BUT BECAUSE TARTIKOFF OR BY A MORE RESTRICTIVE H. TWO WAY PROGRAM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND CALIFORNIA'S FARM LABOR CONTRACTING LICENSING SYSTEM WHICH THE FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTING SYSTEM WAS ACT LARGELY BASED ON THE AS A MODEL. ANNETTE MODELS ACTUALLY CALLED OUT IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE JUDICIARY ANALYSIS. TRADING SP FOUR SEVENTY SEVEN. THERE'S A PROGRAM IS IS REGULATED BY RESTRICTIVE FEDERAL PROGRAM THERE ARE SEVERAL PLANETS THAT I'D LIKE TO OUTLINE THEIR EACH WAY WORKERS RISK MUST RECEIVE ACCURATE WRITTEN INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAGES HOURS WORKING CONDITIONS AND BENEFITS OF THE EMPLOYMENT BEING OFFERED. THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPIRIT YOU PRIOR TO GETTING A VISA. AND NO LATER THAN ON THE FIRST DAY OF WORK. TO RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION LANGUAGE UNDERSTOOD BY THE WORKER WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ARE ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM DISCRIMINATION OR DISCHARGE FOR FILING A COMPLAINT TESTIFYING OR EXCITING A RIGHTS IT ANYWAY OR HELPING OTHERS TO DO SO. AND EMPLOYERS MUST COMPLY WITH ALL OTHER APPLICABLES LAWS INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION AGAINST HOLDING WORKERS PASSPORTS OR OTHER IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS. ARE IN ADDITION WERE SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA'S FARM LABOR CONTRACTING LICENSING SYSTEM. AND AS A REGARD HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS ALSO. IN IMPORTANT. AREA THAT NEEDS TO ALWAYS BE SAFEGUARDED. FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS ARE ONE OF TEN OR ELEVEN SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS THAT MUST POST A WORKPLACE POSTER. OF REGARDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING INFORMATION FOR WORKERS AND THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

AND IN FEDERAL COURT. EACH REPROGRAM USERS HAVE TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATIONS ARE REGULATED BY THREE DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES. I THINK IT MIGHT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST OF WHAT THE US DEPARTMENT LABOR DOESN'T CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO H. TO A IN FORSMAN. AND THEY ARE VERY ACTIVE AND WE SEE PRETTY REGULAR PRESS RELEASES UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THEY FIND. EMPLOYERS WHO ARE NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF EMPLOYERS WHO EMPLOY EACH TO WORKERS DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. ARE AYE OBJECTION TO IT AB NINETEEN THIRTEEN BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO DO VERY MUCH. TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS WERE NOT ALREADY INCLINED TO TO OBEY THE LAW. AND COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AND WILL DO VERY MUCH TO INDUCE THOSE WHO WERE NOT SO INCLINED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. SO THAT WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OPPOSITION.
