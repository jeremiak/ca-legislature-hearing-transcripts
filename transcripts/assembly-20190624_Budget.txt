YES CERTAINLY -- SO THE EARLY THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY EDUCATION AND CARE -- WAS AS THE HEAD CREATED TO ADDRESS SOME VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT -- WILL BE BUILDING ON TOP OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION SO ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES I THINK THAT -- AS THE ADMINISTRATION OF WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO LOOK AT IS -- THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS TO SUPPORT LARGE PROGRAM EXPANSION -- WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT IDENTIFIED -- BUT DIDN'T REALLY GO INTO MUCH DETAIL AS TO HOW WE CAN CREATE THINGS LIKE PUBLIC PRIVATE OR LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FUNDING FOR OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. I'M I THINK THE OTHER AT SOME OF THE OTHER BIG PIECES ARE AROUND THINGS LIKE HOW WE BUILD -- MORE AT ACCESSIBLE CAREER LADDER FOR WORKERS IN THE CHILD CARE -- INDUSTRY -- ESPECIALLY FOR SUBSIDIZED FAMILIES SO THERE ARE SOME PIECES AND PARTS THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE BUILDING ON THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS BUT LOOKING FOR SOME MORE -- ACTIONABLE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND A PRE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRIORITIZATION IN TERMS OF HOW WE FUND THOSE IN THE FUTURE GIVEN THAT IT IS GOING TO BE.

GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE FIRST TELEPHONE NUMBERS TRAILER BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT -- AFFECT. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THE COVER CALIFORNIA -- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. BERMAN A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS -- MOST NOTABLY -- THE THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT IMPLEMENT. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- FOR CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE AS WELL AS THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE SUBSIDIES PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY COVER CALIFORNIA -- THE BILL INCLUDES -- PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING -- VALUE BASED INCENTIVES -- PAYMENTS IN THE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM -- THE BILL INCLUDES -- PROVISIONS -- RESTORING OPTIONAL BENEFITS THAT WERE CUT -- AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION -- AND THE BILL -- INCLUDES PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING A FEW -- AUGMENTATIONS -- RELATING -- TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES -- PREVENTION AND CONTROL -- HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS ON THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. MISTRAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO QUESTION ABOUT THE THE MANDATE AND THE PENALTY SO ORIGINALLY THE COUNT CONCEPT WAS TO HELP THE PENALTY REVENUE PAY FOR THE SUBSIDIES AND I I REALIZE THAT WITH THE SUBSIDIES ENDED UP BEING BIGGER THAN THE PENALTY REVENUE SO THE STATE'S GOING AFTER AUGMENTED BUT THAT. THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT RIGHT -- THAT WAS THE THAT WAS THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND A REVISION BUT AS YOU NOTED THE FINAL CONFERENCE PACKAGE -- INCLUDES SUBSIDY APPROPRIATIONS THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF THE REVENUES OVER THE MULTI YEAR WINDOW OKAY SO MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN PUZZLING ME. BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE SUBSIDIES GO -- THE BULK OF THEM WERE GOING FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE BETWEEN 40% 6100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL SO WHEN I DO THE MATH ON THAT THAT'S FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SIX ARE PERCENT AS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR AND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE IT'S ALMOST A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND A YEAR. SO I MEAN IT'S IT'S QUITE A HIGH INCOME. IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FROM WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IMPLEMENTING PENALTIES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE PENALTY WAS PAID BY. A YOUNG. ARE YOUNGER. HEALTHY PERSON MAKING BETWEEN THIRTY THIRTY THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS SO HERE'S MY PUZZLEMENT IS. WHY ARE WE? TAKING REVENUE FROM. PEOPLE MAKING THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND GIVING IT IN SUBSIDIES TO PEOPLE MAKING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME -- WELL I THINK I WOULD NOTE THAT -- LOOKING AT ONLY THE STATE SUBSIDY COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL PICTURE. MIGHT LEAD ONE TO CONCLUDE THAT I WOULD SAY THAT -- IF YOU INCLUDE THE COMPARABLY GENEROUS FEDERAL SUBSIDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS BELOW LEVEL -- OUR AUGMENTATION KIND OF PIGGY BACKS OFF OF THAT AND SO THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE -- BELOW THE LEVELS THAT YOU MENTIONED ALREADY ARE RECEIVING A RELATIVELY GENEROUS FEDERAL SUBSIDY ASSISTANT OR NOT IF THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. WELL BUT BETWEEN BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND 4100% FILE POVERTY LEVEL THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL SUBSIDIES -- AND AND YELL BELOW 110038% OF FILE POPULATE LEVEL THEY GENERALLY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL AS WELL -- SO THERE WOULD BE A SMALL SEGMENT THERE -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL OR RATHER THE FINAL CONFERENCE COMPROMISE ALSO INCLUDED -- AND AUGMENTATION TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES ACTUALLY BY SOME OF THESE DOWN 2% FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BELOW A 138% A MEDI CAL -- OF OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHO -- AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLES AND ORANGES HERE NOT ON ONE OF LABOR THE POINT BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR PEOPLE WHO ELECT TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE AND I'M SAYING IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE. AND YOU MAKE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR MONEY AND COUNTY REVENUE AND WHERE TO SPEND IT ON A SUBSIDY FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I THANK YOU FOR BEING RESPONSIVE. THANK YOU YOU THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEE NUMBER GOT A PUBLIC COMMENT.

RONALD COMING HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE CERTAINLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE AND THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM CERTAINLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WE DO THINK THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HELP. INDIVIDUALS -- HAVE A EXTRA PUSH TO TO BUY COVERAGE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT HAVING MORE PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM HELPS US ALL BRING OUR PREMIUMS DOWN -- SO WE ALSO THINK THAT TO BE AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WILL ALSO HELP ABOUT ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEED ASSISTANCE IN COVERAGE WHETHER IT'S THE PEOPLE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT UNDER A HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT WHETHER IT'S THE PEOPLE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WE WE ABSOLUTELY A PREACHER PREACH A WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE -- ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE RESTORATION OF THE OPTIONAL BENEFITS THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY -- AT THE TIME OF THE RECESSION SO THANK THE LEGISLATURE ND APARTMENT FINANCE FORCE WORKING WITH FORD IMPLEMENTATION THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK OUR SUPPORT FOR THE RESTORATION OF CRITICAL MATIC MEDI CAL BENEFITS THESE WERE CUT DUE TO BUDGETARY REASONS. AND ARE LONG OVERDUE SO DO APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE -- RESTORING THOSE BENEFITS THAT TO MR OVER NO TEETH POINT ABOUT -- THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE I DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE ADDED -- TO ON DATA COLLECTION TO SEE WHO'S PAYING THAT MANDATE SO DO DO APPRECIATE THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE. AS WELL AS THE NCO TAX -- ALLOWING THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PURSUE THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. SIGNAL FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR NEXT TRAILER BILL SB -- ONE OH FOUR SB ONE OF FOUR OF THE HEALTH ON OF US -- TO CONTAINS PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND DH CS -- NOTABLY THE TRAILER BILL WOULD -- CHANGE THE FOCUS AND COMPOSITION OF A CURRENT -- HEALTHCARE COUNCIL -- AND EXPAND THE MEMBERSHIP IN CHANGE -- SOME OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS -- THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDES -- THE THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL -- TO UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE -- IT INCREASES THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY LIMIT LEVEL -- FOR CERTAIN SENIORS AND DISABLED PERSONS -- AND ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONS -- RELATING TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT -- THAT RECOGNIZE YOLO COUNTY IS A COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM COUNTY -- AND WITH WOULD WITHHOLD REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM THE C. M. S. P. BOARD UNTIL THEIR RESERVES EQUAL TO YEARS OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES AFTER WHICH THEIR REALIGNMENT -- REVENUES WOULD BE RESTORED TO CURRENT LAW LEVELS. THANK YOU IN THE MYSTERY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS UNDER AT TWO EIGHT AGE. TWENTY SIX ARE THOSE ELIGIBLE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS MATCH -- AND ACTUALLY BUT BY SHOULD CORRECT WHAT I SAID YEAH IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY THROUGH AGE TWENTY FIVE OR UP TO TWENTY SIX AS YOU NOTED -- UNDER CURRENT LAW THE CURRENT. FEDERAL. MEDICAID PROGRAM -- UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN SERVICES WE REFER TO THEM AS RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE GENERALLY THEY ARE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND PREGNANCY RELATED SERVICES -- UNDER OUR EXPANSION -- NEWLY COVERED INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FEDERAL SERVICES THEY'RE CURRENTLY OFFERED. SO WE WILL BE DRAWING DOWN SOME FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE BUT ALL OF THE SERVICES AND ACCESS TO RESTRICTED CODES GO RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE THAT MAKE IT FULL SCOPE COVERAGE -- WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE STATE GENERAL FUND. OKAY SO -- BUT NORMALLY. A PEOPLE IN THAT AGE RANGE THAT WE PUT ON MEDI CAL ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AT LEAST A 50% FEDERAL FUND MATCH RIGHT IF NOT SOMETIMES MORE DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE AND AND WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE. THAT WAS ALRIGHT I BELIEVE JUST FOR THOSE VERY LIMITED SERVICES THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE. OKAY SO WHAT WOULD BE WRONG TO SAY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WORK SPENDING MEDI CAL TO ARE COSTING THE STATE TWICE AS MUCH PER CAPITA IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY COVERED BY MEDICARE. I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WORKS OUT EXACTLY TO TWICE AS MUCH AGAIN BECAUSE THERE IS SORT OF A AN EFFECT WHERE THE INCREASED CASELOAD -- WITH PEOPLE COMING INTO THE PROGRAM THAT NEW POPULATION WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THE MATCH FOR THOSE RESTRICTED SERVICES. BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING YOUR POINT IS RIGHT THAT THAT THE STATE GENERAL FUND WOULD COVER A DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE -- PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL COSTS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE MEDICAL POPULATION GENERALLY SPEAKING THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. PUBLIC ON THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FARMING DATING AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE C. M.

CONTINUE WHAT IT'S DOING WITH THE PATHWAY TO HEALTH PROGRAM AND PROVIDE OPTIONS TO UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO MAY NOT FIND OPTIONS ELSEWHERE. ADDITIONALLY WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT -- THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON HEALTH FOR ALL YOUNG ADULTS AND CERTAINLY WHAT THAT MEANS TO INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE IT PUTS THEM AT VERY SERIOUS RISK TO GET.
