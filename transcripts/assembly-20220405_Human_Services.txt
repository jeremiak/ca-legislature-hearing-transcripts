EXPANDS OUR CURRENT FOSTER FAMILY HOME IS SMALL FAMILY HOME INSURANCE FUND PROGRAM BY TERRIFYING CLAIMING RULES UNDER LICENSING RULES THAT TOOK EFFECT LAST OCTOBER TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR MINORS PHIL ST THE NEW TITLE FOR- DASH E. FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AS AN ELIGIBLE FACILITY. UNDER THE- F. F. P. S. A PROGRAM FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT. TO ENSURE THESE CALIFORNIA FOSTER YOUTH RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A NEW LICENSING CATEGORY OF SPECIALIZED FOSTER HOMES. FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH FROM SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. AND I DO WANTTO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THAT MEANS THAT. EVEN AS OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM INVOLVES A PARTNERSHIP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS BILL REALLY REQUIRES A PARTNERSHIP WITH DSS TO KINDA HELP US. FLUSH OUT A PRO THAT CONFORMS TO FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES PROVIDING BOARD CARE AND SUPERVISION BY RESOURCE PARENT. STANDARD FOR THESE HOMES WILL AS I MENTIONED WE DEVELOPED UNDER DSS- COUNTY PLACE NEEDS HIS FOSTER YOUTH INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS OR COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. THE BILL ALSO ENSURES THAT THE SPECIALIZED FOSTER HOMES MEET REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AID TO FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. OF THE FF PSA ALSO ALLOW STATES THAT HAVE EXTENDED THEIR FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS. TO DISTASTE IN THEIR CHAFEE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAMS UP TO AGE TWENTY THREE WHICH CALIFORNIA HAD NOT YET OPTED TO DO. THIS BILL EXPANDS ITS EXISTING I'LL P. TO AGE TWENTY THREE- DEPENDING UPON AVAILABLE FUNDING. AND REQUIRES DSS TO UPDATE I'LL P. STANDARDS STATEWIDE IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES FOR SHOOT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SO AGAIN DEPEND UPON WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DSS. IN A DISTRICTS IN THE AISLE PH CAP THIS BILL LEADS TO EXPECTATIONS FOR THE IOP PROGRAMS. TO INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING FAMILY FAMILY LIKE AN ADULT CONNECTIONS. AND ACCESS TO SUPPORT FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION TO ACHIEVE VOCATIONAL GOALS SELF. REALLY LOOK AT HOW DO YOU. EQUIP CHILDREN. IT EMOTIONALLY FAMILY WINES. BUT SKILL WISE TO KIND OF- ENTER INTO ADULT LIFE AS PRODUCTIVE AND CONTRIBUTING INDIVIDUALS- WITH ALL THE SELF ESTEEM THAT THAT ENTAILS. FINALLY GASSMAN RECOGNIZE INSISTS YOU ARE REGARDING THE FOSTER FAMILY HOME AND SMALL FAMILY HOME INSURANCE FUND. THAT PROGRAM DOES NOT SPECIFY TERMS GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS ARISING FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE. NOR DOES IT SUPPORT FOSTER CARE GIVERS WHEN THEY FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES IN THE CARE OF FOSTER YOUTH. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE FOSTER FAMILY HOMES SMALL FAMILY HOME INSURANCE FUNDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPY PROGRAMS. AND REQUIRES A FUND REIMBURSED CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF PROPERTY DAMAGE IF DAMAGES ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. OF THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HAS RECEIVED BILL OPPOSITION. THOUGH OF COURSE. IN RELIANCE UPON DSS STILL BE ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH HIM THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND MY FRIEND SAID IS BEEN. BOTH TYPICAL AND PRODUCTIVE- AND I'M HONORED TO HAVE PAUL OF ALASKA'S DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION OF COUNTY WELFARE DRIPS BOAT ASSOCIATES BEGAN SUPPORT TODAY.

INSURANCE FUND FOR THE FIRST COMPONENT AB TWENTY THREE OH SIX ESTABLISHES A NEW RESIDENTIAL OPTION FOR TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH. THAT CONFORMS TO THE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY THE PHONE FEDERAL FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT AFFECT PSA AND LEVERAGES FEDERAL PATENT FORTY FUNDING. THIS WILL PROVIDE COUNTY PUT UP PLACING AGENCIES AND FOSTER YOU WITH FOSTER YOUTH WITH AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL FROM THE CURRENT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT PROGRAM FOR MINORS PROGRAM. WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM FOR OLDER FOSTER YOUTH TRANSITIONING INTO ADULTHOOD. AS NOTED BY MR COOLEY UNDER ITS CURRENTLY LICENSE. CURRENTLY LIFE INSTRUCTURE TEACH PPM DOES NOT MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS UNDER AFFECT PSA. THEREFORE WE RISK LOSING OUT ON MAXIMIZING FEDERAL FUNDING AND PREVENTING YOU FROM BENEFITING FROM. THIS PROGRAM THE SECOND COMPONENT MODERNIZES THE IOP PROGRAM. THE IOP PROGRAM PROVIDES IMPORTANT SERVICES AND BENEFITS TO FIX CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH.

FIRST NAME IS A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO THIRTY WHICH SEEKS TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS THAT HOMELESS FAMILIES FACE IN GETTING. HOUSING ASSISTANCE. BEFORE I CONTINUE I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT I'VE REVIEWED THE- COMMITTEE- AND- ANALYSTS. OF ANNOUNCER THIS BILL SKEWS ME AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY WHAT WOULD IN AN ACCIDENT OF HOMELESSNESS I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS MADE BY THIS COMMITTEE THE CAL WORKS- HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS A BENEFIT- AVAILABLE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS CREATED TO HELP FAMILIES AND CAL WORKS PROGRAMS TO MEET THE COST OF PERMANENT HOUSING. OR PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTER WHEN A FAMILY IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR IS AT RISK OF IT THE PROGRAM PROVIDE TEMPORARY I'M HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FOR FAMILIES TO SECURE HOUSING FOR UP TO SIXTEEN CALENDAR DAYS IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE PROGRAM ALSO HELP FAMILIES SECURE PERMANENT HOUSING BY PAYING FOR A DEPOSIT. AND LAST MONTH'S RENT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS ASSISTANCE COMES IN SMALL AMOUNTS AND WITH MANY MANY HURDLES IN FRONT. HOW IT WORKS TEMPORARY IS TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE- IS ISSUED FOR THREE DAYS THEN FAMILIES CAN COME BACK FOR ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS THEN THEY CAN COME BACK A THIRD TIME. FOR SIX DAYS OF HELP. THIS IS A TOTAL OF SIXTEEN DAYS OF ASSISTANCE. PUT YOURSELF IN THESE INDIVIDUAL SHOES LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY I LIKE TELLING STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN MY DISTRICT HER NAME IS TONYA. TONYA HAS CHILDREN TONYA AND HER CHILDREN HAVE ARE HOMELESS AND NEED HELP AND THEY NEED HELP NOW. THEY HAVE A LITTLE TO NO MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS HAVE NO CAR BUT THEY FIND A WAY TO THE COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT AND WAIT FOR HOURS HOURS TO SPEAK. THEY'RE APPROVED FOR THREE DAYS FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING ASSISTANCE THREE DAYS. THEY UP THAT THIS ASSISTANCE RUN OUT NOW THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS TWO MORE TIMES TO GET THE FOR SIXTEEN DAYS A TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE. FOR TONYA AND HER FAMILY. THIS IS MORE BARRIERS THIS IS NOT JUST A BARRIER BUT IF THE BOULDER. THAT IS BLOCKING THE WAY FOR THEIR HOUSING. IT IS A BARRIER THAT MEANS THAT HEARD HER CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO SLEEP OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN GRABBED THEIR BELONGINGS TO GET. UP AND MOVE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. KEEPING BUYING FOOD BECAUSE THEY NEED TO FIGHT A WAY BACK TO THE WELFARE OFFICE TO RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY DEL SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. MEMBERS AGAIN I ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN HER SHOES BUT JUST ONE DAY JUST TO IMAGINE. ON TAKING ALL YOUR BELONGINGS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO THE WELFARE OFFICE TO GET OTHER DIGITAL RECHARGE TO FIND ASSISTANCE AND GET SHELTER BURNER FAMILIES IN OUR STATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 1-005-100-0200 AND SEVENTY EIGHT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.

AND ON AND HALF OF THEM ARE RIGHT IN MY BACKYARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THESE ARE NOT JUST NUMBERS. WE ALL HAVE A TONYA IN OUR DISTRICTS SOMEWHERE. WE NEED STRONG SOLUTIONS TO THIS GROWING PROBLEM AB TWENTY TO THIRTY WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE ENTIRE SIXTEEN DAYS OFFERED BY CAO WORKS HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS WILL BE ISSUED IN TOTAL DURING ONE VISIT A FAMILY SEEKING IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE ADDITIONALLY. THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE ONE YEAR RULE FOR HOMELESS ASSISTANCE AT AUTHORIZED CAO WORKS- HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FOR- ANY INCIDENCE OF HOMELESSNESS IN TWO THOUSAND AND A TWENTIETH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THE PROGRAM APPROVED HOMELESS ASSISTANCE FOR PROXIMITY. THIRTY THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE FAMILIES.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX. COLLEAGUES I BET PART BROKE IN STATES LIKE TEXAS AND FLORIDA ATTACK AND STIGMATIZE OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY FOR DOING NOTHING MORE THAN ASSERTING OUR RIGHT TO EXIST ENJOY THIS. IS EVERYONE ELSE IF WE FAIL TO PUSH BACK ON OFFENSIVE RHETORIC THAT UNFAIRLY CASTS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AS BEING ANTI FAMILY R. G. B. T. Q. INDIVIDUALS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE DISCRIMINATION FOR DOING NOTHING MORE THAN EXERCISING THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS TO BUILD A FAMILY OF THEIR OWN. THE PURPOSE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX IS TO TAKE THIS HATEFUL RHETORIC HAD ON. IT DOES SO BY REMOVING BARRIERS TO LGBTQ FAMILIES WISHING TO SERVE AS RESOURCE FAMILIES FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND TO REMOVE THE STATUTORY STIGMA ATTACHED TO LGBTQ FOSTER CHILDREN. THANKS TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS MORE AND MORE LGBTQ FAMILIES ARE SEEKING TO OFFER THEIR SERVICES AS RESOURCE FAMILIES WHICH PROVIDES OUT OF HOME CARE FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. ASSEMBLY C. AGENCIES ARE BEING SUPPORTIVE PROTECTING PRACTICES FOR LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND RECRUITING RECRUITING PERSPECTIVE LGBT Q. FAMILY RESOURCES. OTHER STILL EMPLOYEE RULES AND POLICIES THAT PERPETUATE UNFAIR AND OUTDATED STEREOTYPES ABOUT WHO SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE IN TWO FOSTER CHILDREN. IN PARTICULAR SOCIAL WORKERS IN CHILD WELFARE WELFARE AGENCIES ARE EMPOWERED TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION HELPING DECIDE WHO GETS LICENSED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY AND WHO DOES NOT WITHOUT STATE PROTECTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION SOME SOCIAL WORKERS MAY ALLOW THEIR PERSONAL BIASES AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY COMMUNITY TO CREATE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS FOR OTHERWISE QUALIFIED. R. G. B. T. Q. FAMILIES SEEKING TO SERVE AS LEVINE RESOURCE FAMILIES ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX WILL PROVIDE THESE NEEDED PROTECTIONS BY PROHIBITING PLACING AGENCIES FROM DECLINING TO PLACE A FOSTER CHILD WITH THE RESOURCE FAMILY SOLELY ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RESOURCE FAMILY IDENTIFIES AS LGBTQ. ANOTHER INCONVENIENT TRUTH IS THAT THE L. G. B. YOUTH ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF LGBTQ FOSTER CHILDREN ARE TO ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. DESPITE ONE WHAT ONE MIGHT HEAR ON CERTAIN CABLE NEWS CHANNELS R. G. B. T. Q. CHILDREN OUR CHILDREN TO THEY ARE JUST AS DESERVING OF RIGHTS LOVE AND PROTECTION AS EVERYONE ELSE UNFORTUNATELY MANY LGBTQ YOUTH CONTINUE TO REPORT DISCRIMINATION MARGINALIZATION AND AN OVERALL LACK OF ACCEPTANCE WHEN NAVIGATING OUR STATE'S WELFARE SYSTEM THIS LACK OF ACCEPTANCE IS MANIFESTED BY THE FACT THAT MANY PLACING AGENCIES INCLUDE LGBTQ FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE LEGAL CATEGORY OF HARD TO PLACE CHILDREN. THIS WHOLLY UNFAIR CLASSIFICATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION ALONG CAN HINDER FOSTER PLACEMENT AND UNNECESSARILY INFLICT TRAUMA ON LGBTQ FOSTER CHILDREN. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY SIX FOUR AND THE STATUTORY STIGMA BY REMOVING THE TERM HARD TO PLACE CHILDREN FROM OUR STATE LAWS WE MUST STRIVE TO INSTILL THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE AND OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM NO CHILD IS TOO DIFFICULT TO LOVE. TO CARE. FOR JUST BECAUSE THEIR RACE RELIGION DSABILITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. MEMBERS UNTIL WE SEE CONGRESS PASS NEW NATION WIDE LAWS PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA MUST STEP UP TO PROTECT EMBRACE AND EMPOWER OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THEREFORE COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE STAND FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOR LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM NOW THAT'S FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

LEAVE THE OF ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT UNDER MEMBERS ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING ON TO AB TWO SIX TWO EIGHT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES. HELLO MADAM CHAIR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WHICH WILL REVISE A COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN PROGRAM KNOWN AS SEA SICK. TO ENSURE BOTH SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKED CHILDREN IDENTIFIED SUPPORTED AND PROTECTED. THE SIX THAT PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH THE INTENT OF IDENTIFYING PROVIDING SERVICES TO SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN BY PROVIDING COUNTIES WITH POPPED IN. TO THE PROGRAM WITH FUNDING WHEN THEY OPTED IN THEY WERE PROVIDED WITH FUNDING AND RESOURCES WITH THIS FUNDING AND RESOURCES COUNTIES COULD ESTABLISH LOCAL TASK FORCES TO DIRECTLY INTERVENE IN CASES OF SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN. AND PROVIDE SERVICES WELL THIS IS THE PROGRAM HAS WORKED TO PROVIDE SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN WITH ASSISTANCE RESOURCES LABOR TRAFFICKED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN MISIDENTIFIED AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN. THIS IS TROUBLING WHEN CONSIDERING REESE MAKOLA TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING SUGGESTS THAT LABOUR TRAP KING MAKES UP 39% OF ALL HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WILL. FIRST REVISED TO SEE SAID PROGRAM TO INCLUDE ALL CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BOTH SEXUAL AND LABOR TRAFFICKED. OTHERWISE CHECK A CHILD A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO BE A JUDGE THEY DEPENDED ON OF THE JUVENILE COURT IN CASES FOR THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN FAILS OR IS UNABLE TO PROTECT THE CHILD FROM BEING EXPLOITED. AND THIRD THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT A SOCIAL WORKER FROM TAKING TEMPORARY CUSTODY OF A CHILD VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING IF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN HAD NOT PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THE CHILD'S TRAFFICKING. BY ENSURING THESE MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT WILL PROVIDE LABOR TRAFFICKED CHILDREN WITH THE SAME COURT PROCEDURES SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS A SEXUALLY TRAFFICKED CHILDREN HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JOSEPH WILL RELATE VIELE. FROM THE SUNITA JANE ANTI TRAFFICKING POLICY INITIATIVE OF LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL AND ETHAN RARICK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING REMOTELY. TIGERGRAPH GOOD AFTERNOON I MEMBERS ARE MANY JOSEPH JELLO POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE SCENE I JANE I'M INITIATIVE ONLY A LAW SCHOOL WE ARE A THINK TANK WORKING TO ADVANCE POLICY THAT ARE INTERSECTIONAL AND ADVANCE PREVENTION RECOVERY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I MANY INTENTION BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE HAS A CONSISTENT AND EQUABLE APPROACH TO ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR ALL MINORS. OUT ONE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION OF CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING AND CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING IS THAT FRAUD FORCED AN ORACLE- SHOULD MUST BE PRESENT IN LABOR TRAFFICKING. THIS DEFINITION DERIVED FROM FEDERAL STATUTE THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT THIS MEANS THAT THIS DEFINITION IS NARROW AND DOES NOT AFFECT MINERS WHO MAY BE WORKING PART TIME TO ASSIST THEIR FAMILIES OR EVEN THOSE. THAT MAY BE. FACING. LABOR ABUSES AND EXPLOITATION ACCEPTED AND IT'S IPLIED IN CURRENT STATE LAW IN CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE TWO TWO TWO THREE SIX POINT ONE. WHICH IS STAYS THAT FORCED LABOR ALL SERVICES HAVE TO BE THROUGH FORCE FRAUD. OR COERCION WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WILLING TO WORK. WITH FOLKS AS A RELEASED THE CONCERNS OF THE HAPPY WITH THIS DEFINITION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT OUTLINES ALSO WITH THE STATE DEFINITION. ARE NATURALLY IS ALSO CURRENT ADVICE ADVOCATING A PROPOSAL AUTHORED BY A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS A LEAD ORGANIZATION AGE AND AGENCY DEALS WITH LABOR TRAFFICKING FOR ADULTS. THAT'S WHY WE ARE DIRECTING THE AT THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO ADULTS OR MINORS TO CALL OSHA WHEN IT COMES TO LABOR TRAFFICKING THERE AND BARELY AND THEY ONLY PROVIDE ENFORCEMENT AND REFER CASES TO AGENCIES. PERCENT WELL ANY PART THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WALL THAT COULD BE ANY PERFECT SYSTEM AND A PERFECT BELT WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT LAW. PLACES AND- W. TO CHAO WEALTH. TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ABUSE AND NEGLECT THESE INCLUDE CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING AND COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION. JANET AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING ARE LACKING A CONSISTENT. I'M APPROACH AND I ALSO ARE MISSING OFFICE KEY SERVICES SUCH AS TRAUMA SERVICES. AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF THE SISAK PROGRAM BEEN ENACTED IN THIRTY EIGHT. COUNTIES WE BELIEVE THAT MANY COUNTIES ARE ALSO A BY THE FACT THAT PROVIDING SOME SERVICES AND IDENTIFYING SOME MINERS FOR INSTANCE VENTURA COUNTY CHANGED THEIR NAME AT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MORE BROADER. I AT SOME COUNTIES HAVE ALSO POINT OUT OR CREATIVE POSITIONS IN. THAT PEOPLE WILL REFER. A CHILD LABOR CASE IS TO THAT INDIVIDUAL SO THEY WILL BE FLAG. AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TERMING THAT THE PROGRAM FUNDS MAY BE LEVERAGED TO TRAIN SOCIAL WORKERS ON SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKING DOES THE STATE ALREADY INDIRECTLY TO SOME EXTENT PROVIDES A I'M KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THEY MUST DO SOMETHING TO COVER THIS POPULATION. LABOR TRAFFICKING DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITY THIS COMMUNITIES ARE TREATED EQUALLY. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT IF AN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT IS THE VICTIM OF LABOR TRAFFICKING IS LIKE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL ALL. SELL SICK HELP ON THEIR OWN. LASTLY MINORS DO NOT CHOOSE TO BE EITHER VICTIM OF SEX LABOR TRAFFICKING OF BOTH DOES THIS STATION NOT TRYING TO LIMIT THE SERVICES TO EITHER OFF. I WITH THAT HABIT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I. THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE YOUR SECOND WITNESS- ETHAN RADIC. AND THAT WILL BE ON THE PHONE. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THIS IS ETHAN RARICK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SIX TWO EIGHT. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE STATE GOVERNMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY WE ISSUEDA SERIES OF THREE REPORTS EXAMINING STATE'S RESPONSE LABOR TRAFFICKING. PERFECT FORM OF MODERN SLAVERY THE POINTS INNOCENT EXPLOITS IN WORKERS REPORTS. OR COERCION DURING OUR STUDY OF LATE CRAFTING WE HEARD FROM A BROAD ARRAY OF EXPERT AT. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND PORTENT EIGHT CORRECTLY FROM THE IVR OF TRACK BUT LET TRAFFICKING AMONG US REGARDLESS REGARDLESS OF GENDER AGE OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RUN AWAY IN HOMELESS BECAUSE WELL AS FOSTER CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THIS EXPLOITATION. YOUR CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTIONS FOR CHILD VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING PARTS IN IN OUR REPORT LABOR TRAFFICKING STRATEGIES TO UNCOVER THIS HIDDEN CRIME WE FOUND THE PROTECTIONS FOR CHILD VICTIMS FOCUSED FAR MORE ON SEX TRAFFICKING. COMBATING SEX TRAFFICKING IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND IT MUST CONTINUE BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE TARGET LABOR TRAFFICKING JUST OF THE GRASS ABILITY TO ENSURE CHILD VICTIMS OF ALL FORMS OF TRAFFICKING ARE PROTECTED BY STATE LAW. THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED THAT LAWMAKERS UPDATE EXISTING LAWS SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED THE LAW THE HUMAN TRAFFIC COMMERCIAL CHECKED. ALL FORMS OF. THANK DOESN'T HEARING AGAINST WITH. AB TWO SIX EIGHT WOULD CARRY OUT THIS BY AS YOU KNOW.

PRODUCING A BROAD DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHEN SPECIFIED IN. WOULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE BILL WE OPPOSE THE PER BAN REQUESTS THAT THIS EXPANSION BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. AS HAS BEEN NOTED BY OTHERS INCLUDING BLATANT HOPE HOOVER COMMISSION. LABOR TRAFFICKING CONTINUES TO BE A CRIME THAT IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD OR RECOGNIZED AND- THERE'S LITTLE AUTHORITATIVE DATA ABOUT THE EXTENT OF LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE. AND I SUSPECT THAT HAVE OCCURRED. ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN HER TRAFFIC BIG WE REVIEWED HAVE BEEN CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED INTO TWO GROUPS. ARE THEY CLEARLY HAVE OTHER ABUSE NEGLECT OCCURRING THAT WOULD BRING THEM UNDER THE WAKE THREE DEFINITIONS WITHOUT ANY NEED TO CHANGE. OR THERE IS NO ABUSE CERTAIN NICKEL IN THE ACTIVITY IDENTIFIED BY THE TYPICALLY FALL INTO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS PURVIEW AND INSTEAD FALLS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. OPENING UP THE SEASICK PROGRAM PROVISIONS OF WHAT CODE RELATED TO PROTECTING CHILDREN TO A VERY BROAD GROUP OF CHILDREN WITHOUT CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING. OR KNOWN CRITERIA TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS AS ALSO NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WITHOUT A CLEAR SCHOOL PART OF. THE SIX TEN TAKES AWAY. PERSISTED SERVE YOU THROUGH THE SEA SICK PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY THAT'S BROUGHT EXPANSION COULD EXACERBATE THE EXISTING CHALLENGES OF A DISPROPORTIONATE OVER REPRESENTATION OF CHILDREN OF COLOR IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND ISSUE AT HAND AND OTHER BILLS HEARD PREVIOUSLY IN THIS HEARING. C. W. D. A. SUPPORTS EFFORTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE INCLUDING LABOR DEPARTMENT IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES TO COLLECT SPECIFIC DATA RELATED TO LABOR TRAFFICKING IN ORDER TO BETTER INFORM AN APPROPRIATE POLICY RESPONSE.

WALDRON. OKAY- OKAY WILLIE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AMBULANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE. THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE TODAY. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE STRETCHES THE DOLLARS OF CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS EVEN FURTHER BY COMBINING SUCCESSFUL FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT PROGRAMS WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE CALIFORNIA EBT SYSTEM. CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING FOOD INSECURITY AT ALARMING RATES AT THE START OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS HAD DIFFICULTY PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR LOW. THREE FINDING AFFORDABLE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WE CAN CHANGE THIS. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE MONEY TO PURCHASE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY DO. A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE PROVIDE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH TO CALFRESH RECIPIENTS AT FARMERS MARKETS THIS IS TERMED SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS THEY NOT ONLY SUPPORT HEALTHY EATING HABITS AND INCREASED THE PURCHASING POWER FOR THOSE WHO ARE AND REST ENROLLED IN CALFRESH. BUT THEY ALSO DIRECTLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE RECOGNIZES THE IMMENSE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND MEETS CALFRESH RECIPIENTS WHERE THEY NORMALLY PURCHASE PRODUCE. THE EXPANSION THIS BILL PROPOSES WOULD BRING SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS TO LARGE RETAIL CHAINS TO CORNER STORES AND TWO OTHER DIRECT FARM TO CONSUMER ENTITIES THAT SELL CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL LEVERAGES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EBT CARDS ALREADY USED BY CALFRESH RECIPIENTS TO REDUCE HASSLE AND MAKE ACCESSING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT MUCH EASIER FOR FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I'M JOINED TODAY BY E. Y. Z. GAS REPRESENTING SPUR AND BY DAVID BARBER DUNN HAM A PARTICIPANT IN THE MONSTROUS GOAL PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON CHECK CALDERON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ELISA GUESTS AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE POLICY DIRECTOR AT CBRE- AND ON ON BEHALF OF SPUR AS WELL AS NOURISH CALIFORNIA ARE CO SPONSORING THIS I WANT TO THANK DR ARAMBULA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE. WE'RE EXCITED BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD DO THREE THINGS IT REDUCES HUNGER IT IMPROVES HEALTH AND IT SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. IT DOES THAT BY PROVIDING CALFRESH CLIENTS WITH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS WHEN THEY PURCHASE CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT PARTICIPATING GROCERY STORES AND FARMERS MARKETS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WHAT IT DOES IS EXPAND THE NUMBER OF RETAILERS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PROGRAMS DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT MAS FRESCO MARKET MATCH AND A NUMBER OF OTHERS OPERATING IN THE STATE- BUT IT ONLY REACHES SO MANY PEOPLE. AND THERE'S A PILOT FROM A BILL. FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT IS AGAIN EXPANDED A LITTLE BIT WITH THE B. T. INTEGRATION AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE IT MUCH FURTHER BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA SPOKE ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE WE ARE. AS YOU WELL KNOW WELL FACING HISTORIC LEVELS OF HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY- AND WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM. WILL GO A LONG WAY TO SUPPORTING THE FOOD ASSISTANCE SAFETY NET. AND WHILE CALTRAIN AS IT IS HELPS MANY WE KNOW THERE'S A BENEFITS CLIFF COMING THEIR EMERGENCY ALLOTMENTS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ARE SET TO EXPIRE. AND WE THINK THIS PROGRAM CAN HELP MITIGATE THAT SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE. A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. FOR THEIR FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WE ALSO KNOW THIS PROGRAMS PROVEN TO WORK- WE DO RESEARCH FOR OUR OWN PROGRAM DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS- THAT WE DO IN THE BAY AREA. BUT THAT'S TRUE NATIONALLY AND- MANY OTHER PROGRAMS AGAIN REDUCING HUNGER IMPROVING NUTRITION AND SUPPORTING FRUIT VEGETABLE FARMERS. AND LASTLY I DO WANT TO HIT ON THIS. POINT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ENDLESS SAID 97% OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WOULD. BE INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS THIS. CREDIBLY ADMINISTRATIVELY EFFICIENT. ANOTHER REASON WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S INTEGRATED INTO THE EBT SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANNA AND BY SAYING WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AS A WIN WIN WIN. WITH A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT IT'S A WIN ON HUNGER IT'S A WIN ON HEALTH AND IT'S A WIN FOR THE AGRICULTURAL. ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA SO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT OH SIX IN FRONT OF THE COMMUNITY- THE COMMITTEE TODAY AB TWENTY EIGHT OH SIX WILL GREATLY LIMIT THE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION OF PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS. WHEN AS EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AND YES LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. PRESCHOOLERS ARE BEING EXPELLED- IN THE EAST AND THE AND NATIONAL DATA HAS INDICATED TO VERY CONCERNING TRENDS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. NOT ONLY ARE THE STARS SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS MORE COMMON THE PRESCHOOL SETTING THAN IN K. TWELVE. THEY ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT CHILDREN OF COLOR. RESEARCH HAS ALSO INDICATED SCHOOL EXPULSIONS AND SUSPENSIONS PRACTICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO HARMING A YOUNG CHILD'S ACADEMIC PROSPECTS BASED RESEARCH. HAS ALSO FOUND THAT SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS DO NOTHING TO IMPACT THE ROOT CAUSE OF CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING PROBLEMS. IN CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL SYSTEM THE BILL ALSO IS. DESIGNED TO CREATE A PUT UP. PROACTIVE SOLUTION. AND WE ARE DOING THIS THROUGH THE USE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSERVE CONSULTATIONS. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EASY M. H. C. ECM H. C. SERVER ARE APPROVING MODEL WAY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND TREE PRESCHOOL SETTING AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE STUDENT. THE STAFF AND THE FAMILIES- I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THE TEACHER OF MY TRAINING DID NOT INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH- TO PROVIDE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND THIS. BILL AIMS TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT NOT JUST TO THE FAMILY BUT AND THE STUDENT BUT ALSO TO. TO THE STAFF MEMBERS THAT ARE ARE- WITH THE CHILD EVERY DAY. THESE SERVICES CREATE A MEANS OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO TEACHERS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH. BUFFER THE EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS AND TRAUMA AND BRING OUT THE MOST OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING OF EACH AND EVERY CHILD. SO WITH THIS BILL WE ARE NOT SIMPLY TRYING TO HAND OFF PROVIDERS- SORRY. SIMPLY NOT TYING THE HANDS OF PROVIDERS BY LIMITING SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH A NEW TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND POSITIVE MANNER THIS LEGISLATION HAS HAD INPUT FROM POLICY EXPERTS THROUGHOUT OUR NATION AND ENJOYS A LARGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT. THE BILL HAS A WIDE COALITION OF SUPPORT IS- IT IS THE INCLUDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY I'M SORRY IT IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY LEARNING AND CARE MASTER PLAN RELEASED EARLIER LAST YEAR.

IS THAT. THE BILL OKAY. SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR VENTURE IN MEMBERS. THE RIGHT FORM HERE. SO ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO OR SO THERE WAS A BIT OF A CRISIS WITH. LOT OF THE FOSTER YOUTH AND PROVISION IF WE'VE BEEN SENDING OUT OF THE STATE AND THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE STATE AND WHAT THAT REALLY SHOWED WAS THE LACK OF CRISIS CARE FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS KIDS WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS. THERE IS AN EFFORT LAST YEAR THAT WE RAN IN AND UP WORKING THROUGH THE BUDGET. THAT DEVELOP A CONTINUUM. ACROSS THE CONTINUUM PILOT PROGRAM FOR THOSE KIDS. AND WHAT AB TWENTY SEVENTY SIX DOES NOW IS IT IT EXPANDS THOSE PILOTS. TWO KIDS ON MEDICARE. SO THAT DOESN'T WE DON'T. WE NEED TO SUPPORT KIDS IN CRISIS. REGARDLESS OF HOW WE CATEGORIZE THEM WHETHER THEIR PROBATION WHETHER THEIR DEPENDENCY. OR ANY OTHER HOMELESS AT ANY OTHER CATEGORY WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO IS PROVIDE SUPPORTS FOR KIDS AS THEY NEEDED THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS EXPANDING THAT CRISIS CAPACITY TO KIDS ON OUTSIDE OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. REALLY TO ALL KIDS AND KIDS WHO ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE SO IT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP WE'RE WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY WITH DSS AND WITH THE H. C. S. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT THEY CAN IN FACT IMPLEMENT. AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO. MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BUDGET COMPONENT TO THIS AS WELL AS WE DID LAST YEAR IT WAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO DEAL WITH KIDS. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEED. AND TO EXPAND IT SO THAT WE ARE LESS INCLINED TO SEE KIDS BECAUSE OF HOW WE'VE CATEGORIZED THEM BUT OTHER THAN THAT MEET KIDS. AS THEY NEED US TO SUPPORT THEM AND PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS SO. WITH ME ARE CAN BERWICK OF THE SENECA FAMILY ALL THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MONTEREY COUNTY BOTH TO TESTIFY I BELIEVE THEY'RE BOTH ON HE PHONE TO SIGN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER OPERATOR COULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR PRIMARY WITNESSES. IN A LINE TO OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE CALDERON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS DR MARNIE SANDOVAL AND I AM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PER CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SERVICES IN MONTEREY COUNTY I'M ALSO HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE AT THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THERE IS A CLEAR USE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE. OVER THE PAST DECADE PRIOR TO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. YES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG ADOLESCENT HAD RISEN SEVENTY ONE PERCENT. AND SUICIDALITY HAD INCREASED FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. EVEN AT THE SAME INDICATORS AMONG ADULTS REMAINED UNCHANGED REPORTING A 100% INCREASES OVER THE PAST DECADE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ARE RISING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS AND HOSPITALS DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND IT COULD ALL PRIOR TO A GLOBAL PANDEMIC THAT REALLY HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO DATA FROM MY OWN COUNTY HERE IN MONTEREY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. TWELVE CHILDREN WERE ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. THAT WITH TWELVE CHILDREN IT STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST TO ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE USE THAT WERE HOSPITALIZED HERE DUE TO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. FOR THE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS REAL UP BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A FULLY DEVELOPED CRISIS CONTINUING FOR USE. THE RESULT IS KIDS AS YOUNG AS SIX OR SEVEN YEARS OLD ARE WAITING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WHERE THEY'RE% SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO ARE SICK WOUNDED DEALING WITH AN OVERDOSE AND IN A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION. OUR CHILDREN ARE WAITING IN EMERGENCY TRAUMA CENTERS EXPOSED TO SITUATIONS THAT FURTHER COMPOUND THEIR TRAUMA. THESE CHILDREN NEEDS CAN AND SHOULD BE TREATED IN A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT OR IN THE COMMUNITY WITH MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE- RIGHT NOW THESE CHILDREN WAIT FOR DAYS AND A WEEK AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL SEARCH FOR AN AVAILABLE PSYCHIATRIC BED. WHICH MAY END UP BEING HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR COMMUNITY AND ONLY REACHABLE BY SEVERAL. HOURS LONG AMBULANCE RIDE. WHAT COUNT TOWN BEHAVIOR HEALTH AT. ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE WITH OUR CURRENT RESOURCES. THE CURRENT GAPS IN THE CRISIS CARE CONTINUUM ARE ONLY MAKING THIS PROBLEM WORSE. MUCH LIKE ADDING GASOLINE ON THE FIRE. THE LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRITICAL NEED TO BUILD OUT THE CRISIS CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR FOSTER YOUTH AFTER THE STATE RIGHTFULLY ACTED TO BRING HOME ALL USED IN OUT OF STATE PLACEMENT AND WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE SAME CRISIS IT'S FACING ALL YOU NOT JUST FOSTER YOU'RE- A YOUNG PERSON SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. ACCESS FEES URGENTLY NEEDED SERVICES I'M NOT REALLY GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. SO AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SIX MOVES THE ACCESS POINT FOR THE CHILDREN CRISIS CONTINUE ON THE PILOT PROGRAM UPSTREAM. ENABLING ACCESS FOR MEDIC CAL ELIGIBLE USE. OF MY COLLEAGUE CAN BERWICK WILL SPEAK FURTHER ABOUT THE CLINICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. BUT ON BEHALF OF AB HDA AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE COURT DESPERATE FOR THE URGENTLY NEEDED SERVICES AND THE VISION REFLECTED IN THIS BILL. I EARNED YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SIX TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OPERATOR CAN TAKE SO MUCH MONEY. GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON CHOI CALLED A MEMBER OF THE CAN I'M K. BEAR AND I'M THE OF. BUT I THINK OF THE OF THE- AND THE TOWN OF AT- AND- I AM SO PLEASED TO BE HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A DIFFERENT AVENUE THAT WE CAN TAKE A WIN FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT MONEY JUST PROP FORWARD SO WELL.

BUT IN PREVENTION IN CRISIS INTERVENTION AND STEPPED DOWN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND WE WERE ABLE TO PULL WITH THAT CONTINUUM BECAUSE OF SO MUCH GREAT WORK BY SO MANY LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE- AND MOVE FORWARD A CONTINUUM FOR YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND THAT'S A GREAT IDEA BUT IT'S ALSO A BAD IDEA BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE AVENUES FOR SUPPORT THAT REQUIRE ENTRANCE IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE OUR ENTRANCE INTO FOSTER CARE IN ORDER TO ACCESS SERVICES FOR THIS BILL CORRECT THAT INEQUITY THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THE IDEA THAT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM CAN BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU. AT THE POINT OF CRISIS WHEN THEY NEED IT AND CAN HELP THEM PRIOR TO CRISIS TO THE FROM CRISIS WHEN THEY ARE IN A CRISIS AND AS THEY TRANSITION OUT WE WOULD NEVER CREATE A PHYSICAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT HAD A HOSPITAL WITHOUT AN EMERGENCY ROOM- OR HAD AN EMERGENCY ROOM WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO STEP DOWN NOR WOULD WE EVER CREATE. A PHYSICAL HEALTH SYSTEM THAT SAID THAT YOU CAN'T GO TO A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN OR HAVE A CRISIS. INTERVENTION IN THE HOME OR COMMUNITY WITHOUT A GOING TO A HOT BUT THAT A- WHAT WE DONE AND THEN HEALTH WE COULD INSIST. THAT THE MOVE KIDS TO EMERGENCY ROOM WITH ALONG WITH PERIOD FOR THE WAY WENT DON'T FOR TO THE CORE. THE AND- CAN'T WE MADE THEIR NEEDS AND UP ONE. TO THEM EVER TO A- EMERGENCY FORMER ROOM. THIS CONTINUING PROVIDE INTENSE COMMITTEE BASED FOURTH- SUPPORT SUCH AS RESP AND- WITH THE CORE. SHAFT THEY CAN SUPPORT EACH. IN READ. AND VISITS TO EMERGENCY. CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS FOR YOU CAN BE ASSESSED. AND PUT A PLAN MADE AND DISCHARGED WITHOUT NECESSARILY ENTERING A HOSPITAL OR IF THEY DO A FULL RANGE OF COMMUNITY BASED INTENSIVE PLACEMENT OPTIONS. SO THAT THEY CAN STEP DOWN- FROM HSPITAL WITHOUT UNNECESSARY- A LONG LENGTH OF STAY BECAUSE THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR DISCHARGE WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS MOMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM. VERY BROAD CONSENSUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESSES AND TO THE STRONG BASIC PRACTICE MODEL ALL WE NEED TO DO IS AN ACT OF THE POLLUTION. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
