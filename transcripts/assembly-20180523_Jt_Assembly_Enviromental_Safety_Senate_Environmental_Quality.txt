ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON. THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS. WELCOME TO THE JOINT HEARING OF THESE OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COMMITTEES. BESIDES MY COMMITTEE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS WE HAVE. CHEER CHIU DAVID CHIU OF THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. COMMITTEE. WE HAVE CHAIR MARK STONE. OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND. SENATOR BOB WHITE CAO SKI MY SENATOR. OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE SAND. WE'RE HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY TO HEAR ABOUT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE ELIMINATE CERTAIN LIABILITY FOR LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS. AUTHORIZES BONDS TO FIND STRUCTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PROJECTS. IN HIS PROPOSED FOR THE NOVEMBER SIXTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET A BALLOT. UP WE KNOW LEAD IS TOXIC THERE'S NO LEVEL OF LEAD THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE SAFE EITHER FOR CHILDREN OR ADULTS. IN THAT HOUSEHOLD PAINT TO CONTAIN LEAD WAS SOLD IN USE IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. LEAD PAINT IS IN MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF HOME STATE WIDE IT'S NUMBER ONE. IT'S BELIEVED TO BE. THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN. CLEANING IT UP THIS IMPERATIVE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. ROVING THIS HEARING SO THE PUBLIC CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL IN FISCAL IMPACTS TO THE INITIATIVE. THAT WHAT IT MEANS FOR LEAD PAINT AND PAINT. LEAD PAINT BATEMAN ACROSS THE STATE. I'M WITH FOR. COMMITTEES PARTICIPATING EACH CHAIR WILL BE LEADING ONE. ONE PANEL. OUR I'D LIKE TO MAKE A PERSONAL COMMENT WHICH IS THAT MY CONCERN WITH THE INITIATIVE. AS JOHN IS THAT IT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND. THAT GENERAL FUND CERTAIN PERCENTAGE GOES TO. OUR SCHOOLS. MOST OF THE REST GOES TO HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAMS AND IT IS THOSE HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAMS. WHICH I BELIEVE WOULD BE END UP HAVING LESS MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS INITIATIVE SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THE INITIATIVE. I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER CHAIRS AND THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. CENTER WHITE CAO SKI I WOULD YOU LIKE TO. YOU GO LAST OKAY. THEN SENATOR STEP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE DOG DUCKED HIS MALE SENATORS YEAH. SO THANK YOU TAKE OFF FOR BEING HERE FOR THE PANELISTS WE ALL KNOW BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN BUT THAT LONG AGO. CENTER STEINBERG. GOT A BILL PASSED TO REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO HEAR. BALLOT MEASURES THAT ARE. SIGNATURE DRIVEN IN A PUBLIC HEARINGS OF THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE BALLOT MEASURE ASK QUESTIONS AND ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE OPPORTUNITY STAND WHAT'S AT STAKE WITH ANY PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURE. WE HEAR ABOUT MEASURES ONCE THEY'VE. REQUIRED AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT SIGNATURES TOWARDS THEIR GOAL I BELIEVE THEY HAVE UNTIL MID JULY OR TOWARDS THE END OF SIGNATURES. MAKE SURE I GET THAT. DATE CORRECTLY DEATHS DID SIGNATURE CIRCULATION DEADLINE IS JULY TWENTY FIFTH. AND THE DEADLINE FOR PULLING THE INITIATIVE FROM ABOUT WOULD BE JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH. OTHERWISE THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WOULD GO ON OUR NOVEMBER BALLOT SO THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. TO FLESH OUT WHAT IT'S ABOUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S IN RESPONSE TO A LAWSUIT THAT WAS SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED BY TEN JURISDICTIONS AGAINST LEAD PAINT COMPANIES. AND A DECISION THAT COMES OUT OF THE APPELLATE COURT TO ASSIGN LIABILITY. AND REQUIRE PAYMENT OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR REMEDIATING THE LEAD PAINT THAT THE DAMAGE THAT WAS. THAT WAS CAUSED BY LEAD PAINT IN THOSE HOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA OR AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THOSE TEN JURISDICTIONS. SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR. MORE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THE BALLOT MEASURE ITSELF AND GET THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME OF. THE COMMUNITIES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE WITH OR WITHOUT THE BALLOT MEASURE ACROSS CALIFORNIA CONSIDERING THAT IN A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES LEAD PAINT STILL ABSOLUTELY POSES A HAZARD. TO OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN SO I FOR ONE AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE INFORMATION IN THIS HEARING AND THEN FIGURING OUT FOR US NEXT STEPS. CURRENT. OF CHEER TO LA CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU A CHAIR CORK AND APPRECIATE TELL ALL THE CHAIRS COMING TOGETHER TO. TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS AN IMPACT ON. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ON LEGAL MATTERS THAT ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AS WELL AS. THE FACT THAT IT IS CALLED THE HEALTHY HOMES ACT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR HOUSING IN OUR STATE. AND THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I CHAIR. AS MR QUIRK HAD HAD SOME RICE. FOR MANY DECADES. A HANDFUL OF GIANT PAINT MANUFACTURERS KNOWINGLY SOLD TOXIC LEAD PAINT TO CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. ARE AND DID THIS KNOWING THE SERIOUS RISK TO HUMAN LIFE ANA AND I THINK WE'LL LIKELY BE HEARING. SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THIS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BRAIN DAMAGE KIDNEY DAMAGE INFERTILITY REDUCED ACCUSE. SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES IN CHILDREN AND EVEN DEATH. AND. OVER MANY YEARS WE'VE COME TO FIND THAT. THESE COMPANIES. KNEW ABOUT THIS. AND IN SOME INSTANCES VIEWED THIS PROBLEM AS. REALLY MORE OF A PUBLICITY PROBLEM RATHER THAN AS A BET AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. ARM AND BECAUSE OF THESE DECISIONS BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIONS CHILDREN WERE POISONED CHILDREN WHO ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO LEAD POISONING. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS THE FATHER OF A TWO YEAR OLDS WHO HAS WATCH MY TODDLER SON. NIBBLE ON OUR WINDOW SILLS. AND. I'VE DISCOVERED I AS I'VE BEEN DELVING INTO THIS ISSUE THAT THAT IS APPARENTLY PERFECTLY NORMAL BEHAVIOR FOR TODDLERS TO EXPLORE THE ENVIRONMENT WITH TYPICAL HAND TO MOUTH BEHAVIOR. AND AT THE SAME TIME I EVEN AS RECENTLY AS YESTERDAY I'VE HEARD FROM PEDIATRICIANS WHO HAVE EXPLAINED TO US WHAT THE HEALTH IMPACT OF THAT IS. AS CHAIR STONE LAID OUT. SOME EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SUIT DO ST PAINT COMPANIES REPRESENTING I THINK FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION. AND AFTER THAT TIME PERIOD A TRIAL COURT FOUND IN APPELLATE COURT AFFIRMED AND A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DID NOT OVERTURN. THE RULING THAT THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PAINT COMPANIES CREATED A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE WHICH THE COMPANIES WERE ORDERED TO ABATE. I THINK MANY OF US WERE SURPRISED SOME MONTHS AGO TO LEARN ABOUT THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD REALLY BE A FAIRLY UNPRECEDENTED MOVE. TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE LIABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES AYE IF VOTERS. SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT TAXPAYERS AND NOT THESE COMPANIES THAT SOLD THE LEAD PAINT OUGHT TO BE PAYMENT SO. I THINK MMHM I CERTAINLY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT. THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE ARE AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR NEXT GENERATION OF KIDS ARE PROTECTED FROM THE IMPACT OF LEAD PAINT. I'M LOOKING FOR TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION AND THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. RIGHT. IT GOT ME JUST SEE IF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OF MAIENSCHEIN WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING STATEMENTS NOW. ALL RIGHT THEN I'M GONNA HANDLE THE GAVEL OVER TO SENATOR Y. KOWSKI WHO WILL CHAIR THE NEXT. SEXUAL. I THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL MY SUSPEND ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES FOR. INVITING THE SENATE. ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY CAN MEET EACH CONDUCT THIS JOINT I'M HEARING I THINK THE SINGULAR. CLEAR AND SIMPLE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS AS WRITTEN. WHAT IS THE IMPACT THIS INITIATIVE ON CALIFORNIA LAW? AND VISIT APPROPRIATE AND GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I AND. CLEAN FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO THE ANSWER PROBABLY TO THAT IS. IN ITS CURRENT STATE NO. AS I. READ THE INITIATIVE ARE THE PROPONENTS ARE USING THE INITIATIVE PROCESS TO RETROACTIVELY CHANGE THE LAW TEN DO A DECISION AGAINST THEM BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THIS IS REALLY A FOR PURSES MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT. THEY'RE. PROVIDING THEMSELVES WITH LEGAL RELEASE OF LIABILITY WHICH IS AGAIN OF FURS AND TRANSFERRING ATTRACT THAT FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY A FOR THE ABATEMENT OF LEAD PAINT TO THE TAXPAYERS. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF CREATING A STATEWIDE ABATEMENT PROGRAM FOR RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS I'M AND ALL UNDER THE. IDEA THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC BENEFIT SO WHAT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S THROUGH HAS BEEN. IT JUST IS HOW DO WE ACHIEVE ABSOLUTE ABATEMENT OF THESE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LEAD PAINT. AND AND WHAT IS THE COMPLETE COST BUT TO DO SO WE HAVE THE DECISION THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND HOW DO WE MAINTAIN. THE INTEGRITY OF THE LAW HOLDING THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE AND NOT UNDULY TIPPING THE BALANCE OF BETWEEN THE SEPARATION OF OF. THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT SO AND WHAT'S BEST FOR THE STATE A CALIFORNIA DOZER SORT OF DOCKETS WRAPPED UP TOGETHER THIS. LUCKY'S THAT STUD TRIGGERED IT ARM AS. THE CHAIRMAN OF IT JUDICIARY IS TALKED ABOUT IS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ATTEMPT IN OUR FIRST PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT. BUT I'M. YOU KNOW IT'S I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS CONTEMPLATED OUR FOUNDING FATHERS OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY THAT WAY THAT THE DEFENDANT WOULD USE THE INITIATIVE PROCESS TO OVERTURN. A JUDICIAL DECISION MADE AGAINST THEM SO THIS IS ANOTHER FIRST IMPRESSION THAT WE LIKELY I HAVE. I'M. AND LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THIS HEARING. AS CHAIR OF JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS POINTED OUT IS. NOW LEGISLATIVE POLICY HEARING. WE CAN THAT MEMBERS HERE ARE ABLE TO MEASURE A WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE AND TRY HAVE SOME CHANGES IN THE STATUTE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS FIT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT LEAST TODAY THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION I'M WE CAN'T AMEND THIS OF A PROPOSITION HOW WE DON'T GET TO VOTE ON IT LATER ON WE DON'T GET TO PASS IT. BUT WE GET TO THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS HERE IT AT THIS INITIATIVE IN THIS HEARING AS IT IS WRITTEN. AND BUT THAT WE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC SO. I'M TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY BUT TODAY I'D LIKE TO START OFF WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN S. I'D NICK SCHROEDER PRINCIPLE. FISCAL POLICY ANALYSTS AND CAROLYN XIU THE DEPUTY A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO GIVE US. AN OVERVIEW OF HOW MUCH AND WHEN. I'M THANK YOU MISS CHIU FOR BEING HERE AND PLEASE BEGAN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS CAROLYN CHIEF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I APOLOGIZE THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER SHORTER CANNOT JOIN ME TODAY. IF I'M MAY FIRST START OUT BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW OUR ROLE HERE TODAY IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER CONTEXTS. THAT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR ROLE AND LIKE THE POLICY COMMITTEE OR BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS. PACIFIC LEAVE PROPOSITION NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR GAVE OUR OFFICE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF ANALYZING OF IMPARTIALLY ANALYZING ALL STATEWIDE PROPOSITIONS THESE APPEARIN YOUR VOTER INFORMATION GUIDES. CONSEQUENTLY WE DO NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON BALLOT MEASURES OR TAKE POSITIONS ON THEIR CONTENT. WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF DURING OUR BALLOT ANALYSES AT THE MOMENT. AS A RESULT MY PRESENTATION TODAY WILL SIMPLY REFLECT. THE BACKGROUND AND CONTENT OF THE MEASURE BEING DISCUSSED. AND IF I MAY ADD WE ARE NOT LAWYERS. THIS CASE INVOLVES MANY COMPLEX LEGAL ISSUES I WHICH YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WE DO CONSULT WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SPECIFICALLY LEGAL ISSUES AT HAND FOR THE FOR THE CASE. BUT DOES MEASURE ADDRESSES THOSE LIKELY WOULD BE BETTER ASKED OF THE PANELS TO COME. SO SOME BEEF SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND. AS YOU KNOW MANY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA CONTAIN HAZARDS HAZARDS CAN BE FOUND IN BUILDING MATERIALS LIKE LETTERS FESTUS. OR BE CAUSED BY OTHER FACTORS LIKE MULDER RADON. LET IS A COMMON HAZARD IN HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PURPOSES OF SAFE RENOVATION AND MAINTENANCE PRACTICES STATE LAW PRESUMES THAT SERVICES AND HOMES BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. CONTAIN LEAD UNTIL A TEST CONFIRMS OTHERWISE. ROUGHLY SIXTY PERCENT OF HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS ONE LEAD AS A PART OF PAINT WAS BANNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED IN TWO THOUSAND THE CITY'S OF OAKLAND SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA OF LOS ANGELES. MONTEREY SAN MATEO SANTA CLARA SOLANO AND VENTURA. STUDENT LEAD BASED PAINT MANUFACTURERS ARGUING THAT BY PROMOTING LEAD PAINT DESPITE ITS OWN HEALTH EFFECTS THEY HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC NUISANCE. THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ORDERED THE CREATION OF A FUND TO PAY FOR. PAID FOR BY THE PAINT COMPANIES TO ADDRESS LEAD PAINT AND HOMES BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. WHILE THE FINAL AMOUNT OF THAT FUND IS YET TO BE DETERMINED THE COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THE LAWSUIT LIKELY WILL PAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOWARDS US FUND. THE MEASURE DOES TWO PRIMARY THINGS THE FIRST IS THAT IT DECLARES LEAD BASED PAINT IN OR ON HOMES IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE. AS A RESULT PINK COMPANIES WOULD NO LONGER BE REQUIRED TO PAY INTO THE FUND I JUST DESCRIBED. IN ADDITION A COURT COULD NOT FIND. THAT LEAD PAINT COMPANIES CONTRIBUTED TO A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND THEREFORE REQUIRE THEM TO PAY TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. IN FUTURE LEGAL ACTION AND. THE SECOND THING THAT THE MEASURE DOES IS THAT IT AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO SELL TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS TO ADDRESS HAZARDS INCLUDING MOLD LED US FESTUS ITS OUTER UP. IN HOMES SCHOOLS AND SENIOR FACILITIES. THE BULK OF THE FUNDS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING HAZARDS AND HOMES. THE MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WOULD ADMINISTER THE FUNDS AND THAT IT WOULD BE A COMPETITIVE GRANT. PROCESS AND THE MEASURE SPECIFIES PRIORITY IS FOR DISTRIBUTING THOSE FUNDS. THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY FISCAL IMPACTS OF THE MEASURE. THE FIRST IS THAT WOULD REDUCE FUNDING TO ADDRESS LEAD BASED PAINT IN THE JURISDICTIONS PARTY TO THE LAWSUIT BEING DISCUSSED. IT WOULD ALSO PREVENT OTHER JURISDICTIONS FROM SEEKING FUNDS IN A SIMILAR MANNER. THE SECOND FISCAL IMPACT IS THAT WOULD INCREASE STATE DEBT PAYMENTS. STATE DEBT PAYMENTS FOR THESE BONDS WOULD BE ROUGHLY HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OVER THE NEXT THIRTY FIVE YEARS THE TOTAL COST OF THE BONDS. WOULD COME TO ROUGHLY THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS THOUGH THE TOTAL COST WOULD VERY ON AND A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING WHEN THE BONDS WERE ISSUED. WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. MIKE I GUESS THE ONE THE QUESTIONS IS THIS. THE INITIATIVE IS EXPANDING THE SCOPE FROM LEAD PAINT. BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE INTO ASBESTOS AND MOLD AND THE LIKE DO WE THIS INITIATIVE COVER THE TRUE COST OF THE BAIT ALL THESE DIFFERENT ILL SET. A HIGHER OR HAS USE THAT ARE BEING POSTPONED. THE PUBLIC. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE THE THE BONDS CAN PAY FOR A ADDRESSING HAZARDS THAT OUR MUCH BROADER THAN SIMPLY JUST LEAD BASED PAINT. WHETHER OR NOT TO BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. TO REMEDIATE ALL OF THESE HAZARDS ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT SOMETHING WE COULD EASILY DETERMINE BECAUSE WE HAVE NO. REAL DATE ON SORT OF THE PREVALENCE OF OR THE COST ON A STATEWIDE BASIS OF THESE ITEMS. AND I GUESS THE IS THAT. GENERALLY SPEAKING IS THAT IN THIS BARN INITIATIVE I CONSISTENT WITH PRUDENT. PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE HAVE A AS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE GENERAL BOND OBLIGATION. FUNCTION. BUT. WELL WE CAN'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE MEASURE AND AND THE RELATIVE POLICY MERITS OF OF. BOND ISSUANCE THE STATE HAS ISSUED BONDS FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. REASONS THROUGH VOTER VOTER INITIATIVES OR THROUGH ACT. WILL ACTUALLY HEY ALL HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS OF THEIR GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. THE RELATIVE MERITS OF THIS PARTICULAR BOND IS NOT SOME THAT WE COULD WEIGH IN ON. DO WE KNOW IF. IF IT DID NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS TO BILLION DO WE EVEN KNOW IF THAT'S ENOUGH TO DO THE REMEDIATION FOR ALL THE LEADS THAT EXISTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PULLING OUT THE ASBESTOS AND WALDRON ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS IS THAT EVEN ENOUGH. FOR. THE LEAD. CONTAMINATION THAT EXCESS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT NECESSARILY. THE COURT CASE. HAD A VERY SPECIFIC. SORT OF AVERAGE COST THAT IT DETERMINED FOR REMEDIATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE TYPE OF. LEAD IN HOMES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ARRIVED AT A SIMILAR SORT OF AVERAGE COSTS ARE JUST ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. PERHAPS THE. THE FOURTH PANEL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE IT MEMBERS QUESTIONS OF. BELIAU. AS SOMEONE HER QUIRK YEAH ACTUALLY I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO MENTION. THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE REYES OF THE. ARE JUDICIARY ASEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS COME AND JOIN US THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SO EITHER QUESTIONS ALL MCCLOSKEY POINT NINE. MILLION THIRTY FIVE YEARS HUNDRED TEN. I THREE POINT NINE BILLION HUNDRED TEN MILLION A YEAR. I WILL THAT RICK WAS RATHER EFFICIENT I WILL TURN OVER ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S TURN IT OVER TO. CENTER COURT HEARD SOMEONE RECORD. I'M GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER STUFF. YOU CAN ALL OF THE GAVEL. OUR WORK IS FROM HERE SO THE NEXT WE'RE GONNA BRING UP ANOTHER PANEL. THE PROPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COURT OF APPEALS RULING IN PEOPLE VERSUS CONAGRA GROCERY PRODUCTS COMPANY AT ALL. FINAL JUDGMENT AYE CASE THE TERM THAT LEAD PAINT POLICE POST A PUBLIC NUISANCE. BUT I WILL POINT OUT POSED A PUBLIC NUISANCE IN GENERAL NOT SAYING IN THE CORPS WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT IS. THAT IT'S NOT EVERY HOUSE THAT CONTAINS LEAD PAYMENT LEAD PAINT THAT IS THE NEW SINCE IT'S THE NUISANCE OF HAVING LEAD PAINT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. GRAYSON ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR FUND. AND SO THIS BALLOT MEASURE AS WAS POINTED OUT HAS REVERSED THE DECISION BY TRANSFERRING THE COST OF THE BAITING LEAD PAINT FROM THE MENU FOR HIGHLIGHTS MANUFACTURERS. TO THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. THE TITLE AND SUMMARY PRODUCED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS FAIRLY CLEAR THAT SAYING THAT WILL ELIMINATE LIABILITY OF THE LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS. IN CASES PENDING ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER FIRSTTWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOR CLAIMS OF THE LEAD PAINT IN HOMES BECAUSE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE AND AGAIN THAT PUBLIC NUISANCE WAS VERY BROADLY CONSTRUED BY THE COURTS. IN THOUGH THE MANUFACTURERS CONTRIBUTE TO A FUND TO ABATE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY LEAD PAINT THIS BALLOT MEASURE PROPOSES THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL OBLIGATION FUNDS TO REMEDIATE HAZARDS FROM LEAD PAINT. AS THE ILIO JUST TALKED ABOUT. SO IF FOUR WITNESSES. WITH US TODAY REPRESENTING AGAIN PROPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE ANTONIO DS A PARTNER IN THE LAW FIRM OF JONES DAY. AND LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE SHERMAN WILLIAMS COMPANY. ROBERT ANDERSON A CHARTER PROPERTY CASUALTY UNDERWRITERS. KEVIN MARCH WHEN THE BOARD CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HOUSING. AND RAUL. ARE WE ARE. THOSE ARE OUT OF THE. ALVY ARE. VERY GOOD AND INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS SO WILL TAKE TESTIMONY. FROM EACH OF THESE FOUR AND THEN OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. SO PLEASE. NUMBER STONE CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT. YES THANK YOU AND FIRST LET ME THANK YOU ALL FOR SPENDING TIME THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. NOW WHAT INITIALLY START MY TESTIMONY. BY TELLING YOU THAT I'M. REALLY RESPECT THE TIME AND EFFORT ALL OF YOU'RE PUTTING INTO TAKING A LOOK AT INITIATIVES THEY'RE BEING PLACED ON THE BALLOT. WE PLACE THIS INITIATIVE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THERE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON THAT THAT TIME IN THE LITIGATION AND SINCE THEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LITIGATION. BUT I THINK WE HELPFUL TO OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. WE ALSO. TELL YOU THAT DURING THIS DISCUSSION. I AM HAPPY TO BE INTERRUPTED BUT I ALSO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO AS WELL. AS PART OF THE NORMAL OPERATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE. TO THE INITIATIVE BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS THE LITIGATION I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES WHERE. WE CAN EXPLORE TOGETHER. WAYS THAT ARE ONLY CHERYL WILLIAMS. CONAGRA AND OTHER COMPANIES CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. I WANT TO START WITH SOME AND I DESERVE THEM LET ME FIRST POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A HEARING ON THE BALLOT MEASURE ITSELF. AND SO ANY YOU DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE THAT PROPONENTS AND THE SORT OF OUTSIDE OF THAT IS IS NOT REALLY THE TOPIC HERE QUESTIONS FROM THE DIETS. MAY LEAD US IN THAT DIRECTION DEPENDING ON WHERE LEGISLATORS ONE AGO BUT I WOULD ASK THE PANEL TO FOCUS ON THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT'S THE SUBJECT MATTER. OF THIS HEARING ABSOLUTELY AND I DON'T WANT TO DIVERT FROM THAT AT ALL SO LET ME START THEN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE INITIATIVE. AND THAT BEING THE CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW I KNOW THAT'S COME UP ALREADY AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION BY. MEMBERS AND ALSO BY THE ALEJO. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT. HAS BEEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED THE CASE I KNOW THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN VARIOUS COMMENTATORS TALK ABOUT THE WAY THE DECISION IS BEING INTERPRETED. THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT ARE UNDISPUTED ABOUT THE CASE AND THAT IS THE COURT DID FIND. THAT THERE IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE TO ADD THAT EXIST IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY THE TRIAL COURT DETERMINED. THAT IN CALIFORNIA IN THOSE TEN JURISDICTIONS BUT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT IN PRE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE PROPERTIES THIS IS THE TRIAL COURT DECISION AT THE BEGINNING. THAT THOSE PROPERTIES. HAD A PUBLIC NUISANCE. AND NOT RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN LEAD PAINT IN THOSE PROPERTIES NOT ALL LEAD PAINT IN THOSE PROPERTIES. CERTAIN SURFACES IN THOSE PROPERTIES AND DESIGNED AND ABATEMENT PROGRAM FOR THOSE PROPERTIES. IT ALSO FOUND THAT THESE THREE COMPANIES THAT WAR TARGETED IN THAT LAWSUIT. WE'RE LIABLE FOR CREATING THAT NUISANCE BECAUSE OF PROMOTING THE SALE OF ITS PRODUCTS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY. SO IT TO FIND THAT THERE WAS A NUISANCE THAT EXISTED IT SAYS THESE PARTIES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING IT. AND CREATED A SPECIFIC ABATEMENT PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES. SO WE MAY GET INTO SOME SEMANTICS GAMES WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE ORDER WAS OF WHAT THE COURT DECIDED. BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE. SCISSION REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS EITHER. IN ROLL INTO AN ABATEMENT PROGRAM OR NOT. AND THAT THEY WILL EITHER BE LISTED. I'M ON A ROLL OF WHETHER THEY IN. ENROLLED FOR THE ABATEMENT PROGRAM OR NOT AND THEN ULTIMATELY WHETHER THEY'RE INSPECTED AND WHETHER THEY HAVE LED SERVICES IN THEIR HOMES. THAT'S THIS THAT WAY THAT SCISSION WAS MADE BY THE COURT WAS TO USE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. TO SAY THAT LEAD PAINT IN THOSE HOMES. INTERFERED WITH THE PUBLIC RIGHT. SO THAT ALL THE PROPERTIES IN THAT GROUP OF PROPERTIES TRIBUTE IT FOR THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE. IN ORDER TO REMEDY THAT PUBLIC NUISANCE THE COURT SAID YOU HAD TO ABATE. THOSE PROPERTIES TO GET RID OF THAT NUISANCE IF YOU DIDN'T GET RID OF THE SURFACE IS IDENTIFIED BY THE COURT. YOU COULD OBEY TO THE PROBLEM BEING THAT BEING THE DECISION OF THE COURT. SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THE PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW THAT REALLY DEFINES THE OBLIGATIONS OF PARTIES I WILL SAY AND. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE I DON'T WANNA VEER AND OTHER THINGS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE PAST BUT IT IS IMPORTANT LEAST TO REFERENCE THE LAWS THAT THE COURT USE. BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE WAY THE IT THE INITIATIVE WILL AFFECT THE OTHER LAWS IN CALIFORNIA. NEVER BEFORE DID THE COURTS. NOR THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE USE OF PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW. TO LOOK AT. THE IMPACT OF LEAD AN INDIVIDUAL HOMES INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE. IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. USE THE LOSS TO SAY YOU CANNOT HAVE A LEAD HAZARD. IN A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. PERIOD CHILDREN CANNOT UNDER THE LAW RIGHT NOW BE EXPOSED TO A LEAD HAZARD AND PROPERTIES. BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN LEGISLATED AGAINST AND HAS TO BE INSPECTED AND ENFORCED BY THE LOCAL OFFICIALS. INSTEAD HERE. TO CHANGE THE LAW. THE COURT SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD NOT GONE FAR ENOUGH. IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED THAT. INSTEAD THE COURT WAS IN APPLY PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW TO SAY HOWEVER YOU DEFINE IT. I DISAGREE AND SAY THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY WAS DEFINED A PUBLIC NUISANCE BUT THE COURT SAID THAT ALL PRE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE HOMES WERE PART OF THE GROUP OF PROPERTIES THAT WERE CONSIDERED. A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND WILL USE THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING. THE APPELLATE COURT THEN SAID. THAT THESE COMPANIES COULD NOT IN ANY WAY BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY PROPERTIES AFTER NINETEEN FIFTY. THE APPELLATE COURT DID NOT SAY THAT A NUISANCE DID NOT EXIST. AND POST NINETEEN FIFTY PROPERTIES SO THOSE POSTS NINETEEN FIFTY PROPERTIES DO NOT HAVE AN ABATEMENT PROGRAM. THERE IS NO FUNDED DEBATE CAN PROGRAM THAT IS CREATED BY THE COURTS FOR POST NINETEEN FIFTY PROPERTIES. YET THE DESIGNATION. OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE EXISTING IN THOSE PROPERTIES SURVIVES WOULD THE COURT HAD DETERMINED IN THE TRIAL COURT. ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE APPELLATE COURT AND THEN IS UPHELD BY. SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA NO JUST PROCEDURALLY SO I'M SURE THAT YOU ALL KNOW THAT LEASE THE INTENTION OF THE COMPANIES. HAS MEANT TO APPEAL THE CASE TO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT AND SEEKS OUT A. FILE A PETITION FOR CERT SUPREME COURT THAT'LL HAPPEN SOMETIMES LATER AND I KNOW THAT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SOME POINT BECAUSE IT RELATES TO THE INITIATIVE. THAT NL INDUSTRIES HAS RECENTLY SETTLED. I'M THE CASE FOR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH ABOUT THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THAT GOING TO THE TRIAL LAWYERS. AYE AND THE CASE SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE INITIATIVE SINCE I. I I THINK YOU KNOW THEY ARE LISTED AS PART OF THE INITIATIVE THEY'VE ALSO SETTLED THE CASE. I SAY THOSE THREE THINGS WITH REGARD TO THE CASE WITH REGARD TO THE EXISTENCE OF A NUISANCE IN A BOTH CATEGORIES A PROPERTY'S PRE NINETEEN FIFTY. AND NINETEEN EIGHTY TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT OF ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING PERSISTENTLY WITH REGARD TO THE INITIATIVE. AND THAT RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS MEANING TO THE WORDS OF FINDING A PUBLIC NUISANCE. I HAVE OTHER WITNESSES HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT IN TERMS OF POLICY MAKING. AND THAT IS IN TERMS OF SOMETHING WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COURT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ROLE OF TRYING TO DEFINE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE. IN TERMS OF PROPERTY OWNERS HAVING OBLIGATIONS ON THE PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND INTENDED IN TERMS OF HAVING OBLIGATIONS ON PROPERTY OWNERS. AND ALSO THE INTENTION TO HOLD THESE MANUFACTURERS LIABLE UNDER A LEGISLATIVE SCHEME THAT WAS CREATED BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. I AM I WILL COME BACK TO BUT I WANTED ROBERT ANDERSON INSURANCE CONCERNED TO LEVY ELISE GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE ON OBLIGATIONS ARE HOMEOWNERS WILL HAVE UPCOMING WITH RESPECT TO THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MORTGAGE INSURANCE AND OTHER THINGS. BECAUSE OF THAT THEY'RE FINDING THAT A NUISANCE MAY EXIST ON THE PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE DETERMINATION OF THE COURT ROBERT. ROBERT ANDERSON AND. THE LAST GUY. OF. YEAH THAT BETTER. CUT THE CAKE. OF FOR THE LAST. SUMMARY YEARS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN TESTIFYING ON CASES REVOLVING AROUND. INSURANCE COVERAGE DISPUTES EITHER WELL FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES OR FOR. USUALLY CORPORATIONS WHO ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO FIND COVERAGE OF ANY THEIR POLICIES. A LOT OF MY TIME HAS BEEN SPENT ON. POLLUTION AND ASBESTOS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TYPE HAS HEARD. COVERAGES AND. THESE ISSUES GO BACK INTO THE. ACTUALLY TO THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTIES AND CAN SOMEONE SAY EVEN EARLIER THAN THAT. AND THROUGH THAT PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS CHANGE INSURANCE POLICIES AS NEW ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS OF. POPPED UP AND. PEOPLE SOUGHT COVERAGE UNDERNEATH THE POLICIES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT OF BEEN ATTENDED BY THE ORIGINAL. COMPANIES WHEN THEY WROTE THE POLICIES. AND THEY INVOLVE MULTIPLE POLICY YEARS. OF THE MONTROSE DECISION IN CALIFORNIA WAS INVOLVING LIKED HIM YEARS OF. YOU KNOW HOW A DIFFERENT POLICIES AND HOW IT WOULD APPLY BOTH PRIMARY NEXUS LIABILITY. SO ANYWAY I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THAT ALSO A DRAFT DID WRITTEN POLICIES OR. ACTUALLY. AND MINISTER TEAMS OF DIVERS SO. ONE MAJOR POLICY THAT WAS A WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE A IG COMPANIES. AND ALSO DID IT FOR A ON THE THE LARGEST. BROKER THE WORLD SO I'VE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS. AND. WHEN I BEGAN TO. LOOK AT THIS AND TRY TO GAUGE THE IMPLICATIONS OF. PUBLIC NUISANCE. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS AS AN INSURANCE PERSON I WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS HOW. THAT WORD. AS CLUB THING THEY WOULD DO A COVER UNDER A LIABILITY POLICY WITH ACTUALLY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF LIKE A TRANSFER. FROM MAYBE PRODUCT LIABILITY INTO SORT A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND ALSO IT OPENS UP A WHOLE NEW. YOU KNOW AREA. SPECIFICALLY AS REGARDS. FIELD WITH THE LID PAIN ISSUES IN THE INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THE CASE UNSOLVED AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IF I CAN USE THAT TERMINOLOGY DOES. IS IT CREATES A AN AWFUL LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE. INSURANCE BUSINESS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THE HOMER HIMSELF BECAUSE. UNDOUBTEDLY THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC NUISANCE EXCLUSIONS OF ALL POP UP ON THESE POLICIES BOTH FOR. FIRST PARTY CLAIMS FOR YOU KNOW THE PROPERTY ITSELF BUT ALSO FOR OF LIABILITY COVERAGE AS WELL. BUT THAT'S NOT THE PART THE WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY BECAUSE IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT. ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS HAPPENING CALIFORNIA AND LANDLORDS TODAY IS THE ISSUE OF HAVE OF THE YEAH HABITABILITY PROPERTIES SO IF YOUR LANDLORD. IN YOUR GUT DESCRIBES A PUBLIC NUISANCE. CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT RENT OR LEASE YOU MAY HAVE TO GIVE BACK RENT FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH. COULD BE A GOOD THING IN THAT PROPERTIES ARE BEING CLEANED UP IT IS CERTAINLY A. TREMENDOUS RISK. PRIOR TO NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. HUG. THERE WAS REALLY EXPLOSION SIX POSTED REDLINING ON THE ON THE ISSUING OF LOANS AND SO FORTH. AND THE FAIR HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT SOLVE BAD. IF FOR THE MOST PART WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD REDLINING. INSURANCE COMPANIES. ABOVE AND PROMPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARE VERY SENSITIVE. ABOUT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH RED LIGHT HOWEVER. THIS HUGE ISSUE OF WHAT IS PUBLIC NUISANCE AND HOW THAT COULD SPREAD FAR BEYOND LED INTO OTHER THINGS IS A IS A REAL. A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE INDUSTRY AND I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE HAPPENING. IS THAT THE PERIPHERAL INDUSTRIES THAT. A FACILITATOR A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS A SALE OF HOMES AND APARTMENTS AT THE OFFICE OR. ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED IN WAYS THAT REALLY COULDN'T BE ARE UP FOR SEEN BY THE COURT'S ORDER. HE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE A. REAL ESTATE OF A YOU KNOW A REAL A REAL ESTATE BROKER AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU'LL HAVE NEW DISCLOSURE FORMS THAT HAVE TO BE ATTACHED MAYBE EVEN A COMPLETE REWRITE OF DISCLOSURE FORMS. IF YOU'RE A GOVERNOR'S ADMISSIONS POLICY FOR INSTANCE. MOST BROKERS HAVE TO HAVE THOSE. TO COVER FOR YOU KNOW FAILURE TO DISCLOSE PROPERLY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. YOU'RE GONNA FIND EXCLUSION FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE IS GOING TO BE POPPING UP IN YOUR POLICY AT THE NEXT RENEWAL. THEN YOU'VE GOT MORTGAGE BROKERS WITH. ISSUES. AND THEN YOU ALSO GOT HIT YOU KNOW THE KIND OF. ENDORSEMENTS LIKE. LINDER LIABILITY INTEREST RATES ARE PUT ON HOMEOWNER POLICIES ARE GOING TO BE MODIFIED OR CHANGE YOUR DISH ALL OF ENDORSEMENTS ADDED SO THAT YOU KNOW. THE MORTGAGES MAY NOT BE PROTECTED THE WAY THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE. WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN NOW AND SOME DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING? OF DIMINISHING IMPROPERLY VALLEY'S BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SERVE RED TAGGED OR HIS ONE ATTORNEY REAL ESTATE ATTORNEY SAID ADDED TO THE SEX OFFENDERS LISTS ONLY HALF A JOKE I HAVE JOKINGLY. THAT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY. OF THIS NEW DESIGNATION. ALL OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE LAWS SIMILAR TO THE STATE OF OUR OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE YOU COULD ACTUALLY FILE. A DECLINE IN VALUE A PLATE PRES A REVIEW AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET. A REDUCTION A PROPERTY SO ONE OF THE BASKET OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD VERY WELL BE PEOPLE COMING TO THEIR YOU KNOW COMING TO GET THEIR PROPERTY REPLACE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S BEEN. YOU KNOW OF A ACTUALLY LOWERED IN VALUE. SO ALL OF THESE THINGS WE THINK WERE ARE GOING TO TURN TO GANG UP IN THE MULTIPLE THE DIFFERENT. SERVICE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE YOU KNOW ARE IMPACTING REAL ESTATE NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS TITLED SHIRTS I MEAN WHAT IS THE TITLE INSURANCE COMPANY GOING TO DO. ABOUT THE TRANSFER TITLE TO A NEW OWNER WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A CLOUD. NOT VERY WELL DEFINED OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE YOU KNOW ON ON THAT PROPERTY HOW DOES THAT DEALT WITH. AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE. IT'S NOT JUST THE ONE HOUSE IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN AN AGGREGATION OF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HOUSES. I THINK THERE ARE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION HOUSES ALTOGETHER IN THIS ENTIRE. UNIVERSE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET A LOT OF AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY BIG. EVENT WHICH INVOLVES A YOU KNOW YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY GO WRONG SO. HI I THINK THIS IS SORT OF WHAT I WOULD CALL NOT INTENTIONAL THAT SORT OF DE FACTO REDLINE. OF REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO STOP. THANKS REGISTER MISTER HODGMAN. I'M LET'S LET'S WAIT TILL THE END OF THE PANEL NOTE AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS SMARTER IN WHICH GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KEVIN MARK BEEN AND I'M GOOD WE COULD YOU SPEAK INTO A MICROPHONE PLEASE OTHERWISE HERE NOBODY'S GOING TO HEAR YOU. AFTER A FEW WEEKS. HOW DO A QUICK AGREEMENT? THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN MARKSMAN AND THE. BOARD CHAIRMAN AND. MANAGING DIRECTOR OF NOAH THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE HOUSING. NO IS THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WHICH WORKS WITH PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES WITH DEVELOPERS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. FIRST TIME HOME OWNERS AND OTHERS WE LOOK TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF RESIDENTS. IN ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSING IN FOSTER DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. I'M FORTUNATE AND PRIVILEGED TO HAVE A FORTY YEAR CAREER AND NOTHING BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN AND OUT OF MY STATE COLORADO AND IN AND OUT OF MY CITY DENVER. PRIOR TO MY WORK TWENTY ONE YEARS WITH NOAH I WAS THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING. FOR THE US DEPARTMENT OF OF HUD. I WAS APPOINTED IT TO THAT POSITION BY PRESIDENT CLINTON AND WERE FOR FOUR YEARS ON MANY AFFORDABLE AND LOWER CRIME ISSUES. ALSO WITH RESPECT TO HEALTHY HOMES. PRIOR TO THAT I'VE WORKED IN THAT IN THAT POSITION BUT ALSO RAN A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HOUSING AGENCIES. IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK OVER BECAUSE OF POOR MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAD TO DO WITH HEALTHY HOUSING. IN FACT I M. WAS THE BOARD CHAIR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO HOUSING AUTHORITY AT ONE TIME. AND IN MY ORGANIZATION OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS MAYBE CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE BEEN A PART OF NO. SPECIFICALLY FOR THE REASONS THAT WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE INITIATIVE BECAUSE. IN LOOKING AT IT AND GIVEN MY PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE. FLAWS OF HOUSING POLICY AND THE COURT'S DECISION. WITH FIRST AND IT I THINK THE MOST OBVIOUS THAT THE DECISION REWARDS SLUMLORDS. I WOULD LOOK AT THIS AT A LOCAL LEVEL CRITICALLY AND DENVER HAVING READ THE DENVER HOUSING AUTHORITY. AND CURRENTLY ARE CHAIRMAN OF THE CITY'S HOUSING ADVISER COMMITTEE AND WE TALK ABOUT. THESE ISSUES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE LOCAL OBLIGATIONS IN JR IN JURISDICTIONS THAT SHOULD. ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS AND ORDINANCES WITH RESPECT TO A HAZARD HOMES. AND IN THIS CASE IF I WERE A SLUM LORD I'M AND I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR DECISION I HAVE NO REAL. INCENTIVE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE I'M WE GET PAID. FOR. PUTTING TOGETHER ARE AT LEAST ELIMINATING HAZARDS IN THE HOUSE AND IN THIS CASE. LET. IT THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TAKING CARE OF THEIR HOMES THEIR APARTMENTS. AND THEY SEEM TO BE. PUNISHED BY THIS YOU DO THE RIGHT THING YOU DON'T EXPECT. TO YOUR HOME YOUR APARTMENT. TO BE LABEL EIGHTY A NUISANCE. THAT I FOUND THAT INTERESTING IN READING THE CASE IN FOLLOWING THE CASE FOR OUR. SOMETIME. DECISION ALSO BELIEVE WILL INCREASE HOMELESSNESS AND A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EIGHTY A? I EIGHTY. A LANDOWNER SAYS ALL RIGHT WE GOTTA MOVE. WE'RE GOING TO REDO THE HOME. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE HOMES AND AND LOWER INCOME. I NEIGHBORHOODS UP COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RETIRED ELDERLY DEVELOPMENTS. I'M WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GO MAY THOSE IS ISSUES THERE THAT I DON'T THINK THAT HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OUT. ISSUES OF RELOCATIONS ISSUES OF MOVING YOUR FAMILY ISSUES OF. WHO'S GOING TO SCHOOL WHERE I AM I DON'T THINK THIS DECISION. WILL LOOK AT THIS. AND I THINK FINALLY IT IS THE ISSUE OF FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT. CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATE WAGES THAT TOOK UP THIS ISSUE SOMETIME AGO AND IT IS LOCALLY BASE. ENFORCEMENT OF OF THE RULES. AND WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THEN YOU RUN INTO A SERIOUS HOUSING CRISIS. THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING NEW THERE IS A HOUSING TRACKS IS PARTICULARLY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I KNOW THE DEFINITION OF AFFORDABILITY IS DIFFERENT IN EACH JURISDICTION. BUT IN I THINK IN THIS CASE IN MY VIEW OF FORTY YEARS OF. OF. LOOK AT HOUSING POLICY WHETHER FORMULATING AND ALL THE NATIONAL LEVEL THERE. HELPING LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF THINK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE. IS THE BEST PLACE TO START. I HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY BUT WE I EVEN GET TIRED OF HEARING MY VOICE SOMETIMES SAYING ALL THESE THINGS BUT. I THINK YOU HAVE A. A REAL RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT IS BETTER THAN THE COURT'S DECISION. AND WHAT IS GOOD HOUSING POLICY WHAT IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER MARKSMAN MR HEALTHIER. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS ROB WILL ALL BE OUT AND I'M HERE TO DISCUSS WHY THE COURT'S DECISION. THE PEOPLE VERSUS CONAGRA. GROCERY PRODUCTS CREATES A BAD PUBLIC POLICY. BOB BEFORE GOING TO THAT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND. AS TO WHAT MY CREDENTIALS ARE. I SERVED. HAS THE FIRST LATINO NATIONAL POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE THAT I WORKED. FOR FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA. AS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN THE WHAT WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT. I ALSO SERVED ON THE OBAMA FOR AMERICA HAS A WESTERN REGIONAL POLITICAL DIRECTOR AND SPENT QUITE. A BIT OF TIME HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WAS ALSO ON. THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE. I ALSO WORKED AT HUD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. WHERE I DEALT WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? HIGH AND. PARTICULAR LADEN MULTITUDE OF ISSUES. PARTICULARLY. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. FOR. PUBLIC AND IN HOUSING AND. OFFICE OF LEAD LEAD IN PAINT ON I SERVED TWO TERMS. THERE AT THAT TIME. AND SO HERE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OF LEAD PAINT. HIDE IT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. ALL HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE. AND TO ENCOURAGE PROPERTY OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOMES IN A GOOD CONDITION. TO IDENTIFY THE OF THOSE PROPERTIES. IN THOSE OWNERS THAT WHO HAVE LEAD HAZARDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOMES. AND TO FORCE A BATEMAN UPON PROPERTY OWNERS SO THAT THEIR FAILURES DO NOT HARM OTHERS. THE COURT HERE INSTEAD OF APPLYING THE EXISTING LOT DECIDED THOSE LAWS ARE WHERE AND NOT ADEQUATE AND CHANGE EXISTING LAW. AS A RESULT OF THE CASE. INTACT LEAD PAINT IS NOW A HAZARD THAT HAS TO BE OBEYED. SLUM LORD PROPERTIES AS YOU HAVE HAD TO SAY EARLIER OWNERS. WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN PUNISHED FOR CREATING HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS FOR CHILDREN IN THEIR RENTAL UNITS WILL NOW BE ABLE REWARDED WITH A FREE ABATEMENT PLAN AND FURTHER INCENTIVIZE? NOT TO MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR PROPERTIES IN GOOD CONDITION. PROPERTY OWNERS ARE NOW VULNERABLE. TWO LAWSUITS BY THE DEFENDANTS FOR CONDITIONS ON THEIR PROPERTY THAT. THAT ARE THE PROPERTY OWNER'S FAULT. IN ADDITION PROPERTY OWNERS WITH INTACT LEAD PAINT COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES AND LAWSUITS. BROUGHT BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ENFORCING LOCAL HOUSING CODES. GOOD PUBLIC POLICY WOULD NOT REWIRED THAT ACTORS. GOOD PUBLIC POLICY WOULD NOT SETTLE RESPONSE. NOT SADDLE RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNERS WITH A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND UPON THEM UP TO THE NEW LIABILITIES WITHOUT THEIR POWER PARTICIPATION IN THE LAWSUIT. IN THE MEANTIME THE CORE PROBLEM GOES UNSOLVED. AND THAT CORPS PROBLEMS TYPICALLY PORI FISH AND. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAW. THIS COULD BE A LACK OF INSPECTIONS BETWEEN RENTALS. THE FAILURE OF THE ISSUE FINES OR OTHER PENALTIES AGAINST LABRECQUE LAWBREAKERS OR THE FAILURE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO REQUIRE ABATEMENT THROUGH. JUDICIAL ACTION IF NECESSARY. SOMEGOING TO FINISH BY GOING BACK TO. A SPEECH BY MY FORMER BOSS FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA TO THE VET TO THE RESIDENTS OF FLINT MICHIGAN. HE RECOGNIZED THAT WE KNOW NOW WHAT WE DID NOT KNOW THAT. ABOUT PROBLEMS FOR CHILDREN FROM EXPOSURE TO LEAD AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HE URGED. THE PEOPLE OF THAT COMMUNITY TO AVOID ATTACHING A STIGMA. TO THE CHILDREN OF FLINT BACK PAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF FLAT. AND I'LL QUOTE HIM HERE HE SAYS. BUT. AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I WANT EVERYBODY TO PAY ATTENTION. IF YOU KNOW THAT YOUR CHILD MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND YOU HAVE AND YOU GO TO A HEALTH CLINIC. A DOCTOR A PROVIDER. AND ARE WORKING WITH THEM THEN YOUR CHILD WILL BE FINE. AND THE REASON I CAN SAY THAT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE IS THAT JUST BASED ON SCIENCE BUT. BUT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THAT HEAP IN MIND THAT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EIGHTIES WHERE WE STARTED BANNING LEAD IN PAINT. LET IN TOYS LEADING GASOLINE SO IF YOU ARE MY AGE OR OLDER OR MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER YOU GOT SOME LEAD IN YOUR SYSTEM. WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP. YOU DID. I AM SURE THAT SOMEWHERE. WHEN I WAS TWO YEARS OLD I WAS TAKING A CHIP THE PAINT. TASTING AT AND I GOT SOME LEAD. OR SOMETIMES TOYS WERE PAINTED WITH LEAD. AND YOU WERE CHEWING ON THEM. NOW I SAY THAT NOT TO MAKE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION. WE KNOW NOW E WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT. WHICH IS IT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IF CHILDREN GET EXPOSED TO LEAD AND AL AT ELEVATED LEVELS. BUT THE POINT IS THAT AS LONG AS KIDS ARE GETTING GOOD HEALTH CARE AND FOLKS ARE PAYING ATTENTION. AND THEY'RE GETTING A GOOD EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE COMMUNITY SUPPORT. AND THEY'RE GETTING SOME GOOD HOME TRAINING AND THEY ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS LOVING AND NURTURING. AND THRIVING THESE KIDS WILL BE FINE. AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO START THINKING THAT SOMEHOW ALL THE KIDS IN FRONT ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT IS NOT TRUE AND I DON'T WANT THAT STIGMA TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE MINDS OF KIDS. SO I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE COURT HERE WAS TRYING TO DO GOOD THINGS FOR THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. BUT COURTS OFTEN LACK THE TOOLS. AND RESOURCES TO REACH RESULTS THAT ARE PRINCIPLED. RATIONAL AND BASED ON REASON DISTINCTIONS. THAT'S WHY. THERE ARE SO MANY BAD CONSEQUENCES OF THIS POSITION DECISION. TO ENSURE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IN THE AREA THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HOUSING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DECIDE THE POLICY AND THE COURTS TO PIETY. I URGE YOU THE LEGISLATURE TO REMEDY THE PACKED BAD POLICY CREATED BY THIS COURT DECISION. AND IF MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO REMEDY THE ISSUE OF LEADING HOUSING. LOOK AT THE DATA. LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AREAS. AND COME TO A PRINCIPLED RATIONAL AND REASONS A REASON SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION. WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING TO ME. OPPONENTS OF THE BALLOT MEASURE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE BALLOT MEASURE. BECAUSE. YOU SAID THAT THAT THAT THE COURT DECISION IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND THAT. ALTHOUGH ON THE ISSUE OF. THENUISANCE THE COURT TRIED TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR IT'S NOT THE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY THAT'S THE NUISANCE IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S LEAD IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE NUISANCE. AND THEY TRIED TO DRAW THE DISTINCTION. AND TRIED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT IMPOSE AN OBLIGATION ON. AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER TO COME FORWARD IT SHOULD NOT LEAD TO A RED TAG OF A PROPER THAT THAT IT'S INTENDED TO BE VOLUNTARY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S UNCLEAR THAT IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. TO DEAL WITH. BUT WE'RE FACED WITH A BALLOT MEASURE THAT TAKES. IN YOUR WORDS BAD POLICY. AND ADDS ON TOP OF IT EVEN WORSE POLICY. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT SOLVING IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE THE NUISANCE ISSUE. BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GLOSSING OVER THE NUISANCE ISSUE WHICH I I WOULD AGREE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH IN ON. BUT WE'RE NOW TAKING. THE PERPETRATORS OF THE PROBLEM THE PAINT COMPANIES WHO THE COURTS FOUND CULPABLE. AND FOUND OBLIGED TO PAY. NOW IT'S GOING TO BE AND THE AND I'M SURPRISED THAT. THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS ARE SUPPORTING THE BALLOT MEASURE BECAUSE INSTEAD OF THE PERPETRATORS. PAYING. THIS WILL BE THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE PAY? SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SLUMLORDS GET FREE REMEDIATION. WHICH OKAY YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S THAT'S BUT EMOTIONAL TERM TO SAY THESE ARE SLUMLORDS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT. IF THERE'S LEAD PAINT IN ANY APARTMENT BUILDING WHETHER NOT THE SLUMLORD OR ANY HOUSING. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A SLUM LORD OR OR IT OR A POOR WERE DIFFICULT AREA. THAT THAT FAMILY HAS. HAS EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE THAT REMEDIATED NOT AT THEIR EXPENSE. AND SO IF THE COURT DECISION STANDS. AND WE NEED TO WAY IN ON THE ISSUE OF NEW SINCE ARE NOT NUISANCE OR SOLVE THAT. WHY THEN WITH THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA? BE THE ONES OBLIGATED. TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY TO REMEDIATE AND BECAUSE THERE'S THAT PART OF REMEDIATION UNDER THIS FUNDED BY THAT BY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. THAT EXACT SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED STILL EXISTS. SO THE BALLOT MEASURE SOLVES NOTHING. FROM FROM THE ISSUE THAT YOU ARTICULATE VERY WELL. AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME AND YET IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN AN OBLIGATION ON ALL CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS INCLUDING THE POOR. THAT THAT NOW THEY'RE STUCK WITH. AND YOU MAKE A GREAT ARGUMENT FOR WHY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD WORK TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NUISANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT SO THAT THE BAD ACTORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO THAT WE'RE NOT HIM IMPACTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT WE'RE NOT IMPACT IN THE POOR BECAUSE THEY. THEY'RE DOING THE WORST BUT YET YOUR. SUPPORTING A BALLOT MEASURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T FIX CAN'T TOUCH CAN'T CHANGE AND THROWS ALL RESPONSIBILITY ON THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA. SO I'M JUST ASTONISHED THAT THAT GIVEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE YOUR BACKGROUNDS WHERE YOU COME FROM. AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING YOU'RE ACTUALLY SUPPORTING SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO WORK AGAINST. THOSE PEOPLE YOU CLAIM TO WANT TO SUPPORT. SO YOU MAKE A GREAT ARGUMENT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO BALLOT. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THE ONE TAKING THIS ROLE. SOME IT OPEN UP THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SO WITH MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER STONE. HAVE BEEN NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT I WAS SO STRUCK BY THE UP PRISON OBAMA QUOTE. IN YOUR FINAL COMMENTS AND I WOULD HATE FOR THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA QUOTE TO FIND ITS WAY ON. A BALLOT INITIATIVE MAILPIECE MOVING FORWARD SUGGESTING. OUR FORMER PRESIDENT MAY ACTUALLY BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE SOLANO JUST MAKE CLEAR. IS PRESENT OBAMA SUPPORTING YOUR INITIATIVE. I COULDN'T COULDN'T I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WOULD WHAT THE POINT THAT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE WITH I THINK UNDERSUPPLY JUST ONE UNDERSTOOD YOU YOU'RE IN MAKING A SUGGESTION THAT COULD NOT QUOTAS PAPERS ARE JUST ONE. AND SO PRESENT OBAMA IS NOT BEING. PAID TO REPRESENT SHARON WILLIAMS OR CONNECTOR AND HE'S NOT MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS A LOBBYIST YET TO MOVE FOR THIS MEASURE S. ONE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. EFFECT MY GUESS IS PRESIDENT OBAMA. PROBABLY COULD GIVE THE EXACT SAME SPEECH YOU JUST READ. AGAINST THE BEHAVIOR. OF YOUR CLIENTS IS THAT POSSIBLE. I'M I'M NOT HERE REPRESENTING THE PRESIDENT REMINDERS DRIVE NICE TO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT AND YOU IT RIGHT QUOTED BY PRESIDENT. YEAH YOU JUST QUOTED HIM SUGGESTING THAT HE MIGHT BE WORKING HE MIGHT BE ON THE SAME SIDE OF ONE THIS FORM AS IT HAPPENS. THE POINT. MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I WAS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT. WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT COMES OUT OF. OF THESE DECISIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE COURT A DECISION AND HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA OR HOW DOES THAT AFFECT. YOU KNOW YOU MAKE A DECISION I HAVE POINT A HOW DOES THAT AFFECT POINT B.. ON YOU KNOW HIGH I I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AYE AND AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POPE OF THE POLICY THAT COMES OUT OF THIS STUFF IS BOTTOM LINE. A OF ISN'T BEING HEALTH HELPFUL TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SO AND I THINK WE ALL I THINK WE ALL APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE'RE. GRAPPLING WITH IS. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLE. THAT IF YOU RESPONSIBLE. FOR TRAINING HARM YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING TO CLEAN IT UP DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. I BUT I WOULD SAY YES BUT BUT ALSO TO THE POINT THAT WE WE. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE KNOW NOW. ON AGAIN SO KNOWING. WHAT WE KNOW NOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT? AS WHAT WHAT IS BEST. AS I SAID FOR THE PUBLIC WHAT IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. AND HOW DO WE COME TO THAT POINT AND. A LOT OF QUICK DECISION I MIGHT MATHIS NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE THE RIGHT TO HAVE BEEN YOU TO DO THAT SO SAW HIM LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNEW THEN WHAT WE KNEW NOW I THINK. EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE LAWSUIT WAS BROUGHT WE DIDN'T KNOW. THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES KNEW WHAT THE IMPACT OF THEIR PRODUCTS WOULD BE HAVING KIDS RIGHT. WE WE LEARNED THAT THROUGH THE LAWSUIT UP THERE THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES DISCOVERED. OR THEY KNEW FOR MANY DECADES. THAT THEIR PRODUCTS WERE POISONING CHILDREN RIGHT. I WASN'T ON THE OTHER END SO I DON'T. OKAY I THINK WE KNEW THAT. IT IF YOU KEPT OF I DECADES OF LITIGATION OVER THIS IS. AND LET ME TELL YOU A COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE UNDISPUTED FROM THE LAWSUIT. ONE IS THAT THESE COMPANIES NEVER CONCEALED. ANY INFORMATION CONCERNING HEALTH RISKS THE PRODUCT. THAT IS THAT IS CONCEDED TESTIMONY BY THE PLAINTIFFS EXPERTS IN THAT CASE. I JUST UNDERSTAND SO YOU SO YOU KNEW YOUR PRODUCT WAS GONNA HARM KID. YOU KNOW HOW TO BUT YOU KNOW THAT NO I'M GONNA TELL YOU ALSO THAT THERE WAS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE COMPANIES HAD. THAT WAS DIFFERENT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THE PUBLIC HAD ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS WERE FROM PRODUCTS. LEADS A PRODUCT LEAD IS BEEN AROUND FOR CENTURIES. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS KNOWN EARLY ON IN THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS WAS OCCUPATIONAL RISKS THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT DID COME UP WITH THE TRIAL. AND I'LL TELL YOU ALSO THAT FOR SHARON WILLIAMS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS FOR SHARON WILLIAMS. THERE'S A HANDFUL OF IN TURN WAS BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO YEARS NOW. SEAN WILLIAMS WAS IN THE LEAD PIGMENT MARKET ALSO MADE A LEAD PAINTS BUT HAD ONLY A HANDFUL OF LEAD PAINT FORMULA OF THE EARLY PART OF THE LAST CENTURY. WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR IS THAT SHARON WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTED ONLY POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT THIS IS UNDISPUTED FROM THE TRIAL POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT OF THE LEAD? THAT CAME INTO CALIFORNIA. POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT. OF THE LEAD AND THAT IS IN THE RECORD THE THIRD THING IS WHICH DAY IT'S ALSO ON DISPUTED AT TRIALTHAT NO COMPANY DID MORE. TO GET THE COMP COUNTRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE USE OF LEAD PAINT. THEN THE STORM WILLIAMS COMPANY IN FACT SURE WILLIAMS WAS OUT OF LEAD PAINT. FOR INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL. UP PAINS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN THIRTIES. LONG BEFORE THAT INDUSTRY MOVED AWAY FROM LEAD BASED PAINT AND THEN NINETEEN FIFTIES. AND CERTAINLY DECADES BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK ANY ACTION. THAT'S ALSO SEPARATE FROM THE FACT THAT DURING THE PERIOD IS HIS PICTURE ON IT TONIGHT. PRE SHAPING ANSWER THAT QUESTION I DO HAVE SOME FOLLOW UPS I ME JUST YET ABSALOM SERGEANT SHARPS WELL IT JUST TO CHANGE THE CAR. SO THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES YOU'VE PROPOSED A TWO BILLION DOLLAR BALLOT INITIATIVE. WHICH WILL UNTIL ANOTHER ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF INTEREST SO ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A TAXPAYERS WANT TO PIN THE COMING YEARS RIGHT. SO THAT IS FOR YES. THAT IS FOR ASSISTANCE WITH SUBSTANDARD HOUSING THE DOESN'T ONLY RELATE TO LEAD SURE THAT'S CORRECT THAT SOME SORT OF HOUSING SUPPORT TOOLS AND FOR SENIOR FACILITY SO THAT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO DRESS THE IMPACT OF OF. OF LEAD IN PAINT AND NOT FOR JUST NOT FOR JUST LET FOR OF SUBSTANDARD HOUSING. AND YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAY THE HIGHER AMOUNT. RIGHT SO OF THESE OF THE BOND CORRECT OF THAT AMOUNT SO NOTHING TO BE PAID BY BY YOUR COMPANY OR OTHER COMPANIES. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT AS YOU KNOW IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE LEGISLATURE FORMED A CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION FEE. THE LEGISLATIVE I HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED THAT FEE. TO FIND ALL LEAD PROGRAMS WHICH WERE CONCEIVED AT THAT TIME DEFINE ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS. BUT FROM LOOKING BACK. PAST PRESENT USE OF LEAD BASED ON THE MARKET SHARE OF COMPANIES THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE LEAD MARKET. THE DETERMINATION WAS THAN THAT EIGHTY PERCENT PERCENT. OF THAT FUND WOULD BE FROM OIL AND GAS COMPANIES A TORTOISE Y. CYPRESS APPRECIATE AT WHAT WAS THE DATE WHEN THAT. WHEN THAT STARTED IN NINETEEN STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE FIRST FEE I THINK WAS COLLECTED AT THE END OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO RIGHT AND THIS LAWSUIT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SO DISCOVERING THIS LAWSUIT DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT THE PUBLIC. WAS NOT AWARE OF EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THEN WENT BUT WE KNEW THAT WE DO KNOW THAT NOW RIGHT. I'M SORRY MISS LETTERMAN I MY SWEET MY POINT IS THE LEGISLATURE WANTED ACTED IN THE EARLY NINETIES. DID NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO TODAY NOR DID WE HAVE THE BENEFIT. OF EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION. AND THE DISCOVERY IN THE INFORMATION THAT WE. HAVE ATTAINED SINCE THEN THAT WERE FOUND IN THE TRIAL COURT RULING. AN APPELLATE COURT RULING AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT KNOW IT VERY GOOD POINT NOT ONLY DID THE LEGISLATURE NOT CONSIDER THAT. IT DECIDED ON ITS OWN THAT WOULD HOLD ANY FORMER MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF LEAD. INTO THE ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIA AT THAT TIME WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT COMPANIES KNEW OR DIDN'T KNOW. AND RATHER IT WAS AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT REMOVING THE IMPACT OF LEAD FROM THE ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. NOW OVER THE YEARS THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THAT FUND. NOR EVER IN EFFORT TO USE ANY OF THOSE FUNDS FOR ABATEMENT I I'M SORRY THAT YOUR IF YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT SO IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. IT BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY KNEW BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW AT THAT TIME. BECAUSE THE LAWSUIT HADN'T STARTED EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACT WAS OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. MAYBE I'M MAYBE I'M ANSWERING THE WRONG QUESTION BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUND. WAS SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH. ANY ISSUES RELATING TO THE PRESENCE OF LEAD IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEN ONE THE COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT NINETEEN NINETY ONE. STATUTE WOULD'VE PREEMPTED THE LAWSUIT I THINK IT DID NOT THE COURTSAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT DO ENOUGH. THAT THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS BY THE LEGISLATURE WERE NOT SUFFICIENT. SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT. A NUMBER OF LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED RECENTLY TO MAKE IT EASIER TO GO AFTER THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES SHOULD BE PUT INTO EFFECT WELL I THINK THE POINT OF THE LEGISLATURE IF I REMEMBER THE ARGUMENT IN COURT. WAS THAT THE COURT SHOULD NEVER BE IN THE POSITION OF LOOKING AT WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED ENOUGH FUNDS. AND SO THAT BECAME THE ISSUE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF THE COURT AND THE COURT DETERMINED THAT NOT ENOUGH FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S DECISION. ON WHAT SURFACES HAD TO BE ABATED OR NOT ON BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL WERE NOT GUIDING UPON THE COURT EITHER THE COURT DETERMINED MORE SURFACES. NEEDED TO BE OBEYED I I THINK WILL WILL WILL LIBERATED RESPECT TO SURROUND THE SPOT I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR FIGHTING ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY WANT TO ASK A QUESTION TO MISTER ANDERSON. IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION ON ON REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGES AT THERAPY FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON ON HOMES AND VALUES TO HOMEOWNERS IS THAT RIGHT. CORRECT OKAY AND AND YOU DO KNOW THAT. SAY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. DISAGREES WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE WRITER. AND BUT YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS PARTICULARLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THIS RULING CAME DOWN. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SEEN ANY IMPACT ON HOME PRICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF LEAD PAINT THAT HAS BEEN IN THESE HOMES. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT RULING RIGHT THE LEAD PAINT BEEN IN THE HOMES FOR DECADES SO THAT FACTOR HAS BEEN BAKED INTO THE PRICE OF HOMES ISN'T RIGHT. ALRIGHT I THINK THE PUBLIC IS. COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF. THE RECENT LITIGATION AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS. THAT. THAT YES SAID ACTUALLY THAT MAYBE. AND I THINK. WELL WE CAN WE CAN LEAVE IT AT THAT LET ME. WE ASK A QUESTION TO. IT MISTER MARCHMENT. I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE I'M CURIOUS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT. THAT YOU KNOW IT I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT REDLINING AND LOW INCOME CAN USE A COLOR BEEN IMPACTED BY. THIS DECISION RETURNS HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE THE PAINT COMPANIES. THAT YOU ARE SIDING WITH TODAY KNEW THAT THEY WERE PROFITING AT THE EXPENSE OF LOW INCOME COMMITTEES COLOR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AYE DIMENSION REDLINING BUT. IN MY BUSINESS IS EVIDENT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT THERE ARE. POCKETS OF OUR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT ARE ALSO. ALSO AFFECTED AND BE MORE AFFECTED BY WHAT THE COURT CAME UP WITH. MY FEELINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE PAINT COMPANIES. AND WHAT I LIKE MY GUESS THAT PRUDENT BAD ACTORS IS NOT IN MY ROOM I HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH MY ORGANIZATION WHEN I WILL GET HURT WHEN I RAN A HOUSE HOUSING AUTHORITIES. THEIR HEALTH HEALTHY HOUSING WHETHER IT LED ITS. PASSED WITH ITS MOLD. AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IN LOW COMMUNITIES HAVE A YOU HIGHER INCIDENCE OF LUNG DISEASE AND THESE TYPES OF THINGS HARM US. THAT IS MY FOCUS AND AS I MENTIONED. WHAT I READ AND NO FROM THE COURT'S DECISION? DOES NOT OF IT IT HARMS THOSE COMMUNITIES MORE THAN I BELIEVE THAT THE COURT BELIEVE THAT. IT HELPS AND HAULING SOME BEING A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND CASTING. A WIDE NET OVER PEOPLE WHO WERE FOLLOWING THOSE LIBERALS. HOMEOWNERS WHO MADE SURE THAT THEIR HOMES WHO LIVABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THESE ARE THE ISSUES IN WHICH MY ORGANIZATION AND FORTY YEARS WORTH OF. OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS WHAT I'M ADDRESSING AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE WILL MAKE A DECISION HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND HAVING. THEN IN FRONT OF CONGRESS TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING HAVING BEEN IN FRONT OF TOWN HOMES TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THINGS. I USUALLY FIND THE BEST SOLUTIONS ARE LEGISLATURE'S ITS CITY COUNCILS IT'S TOWN HALLS IT'S COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. IN WHICH. IF FORTY YEARS I HAVE WORKED ON EVERY LEVEL AND. I THINK THIS DECISION. THIS DECISION DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD SO I THINK I I I I I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE A I DO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE PROPONENTS FOR THIS INITIATIVE YOU ARE ALL SAYING TODAY THE LEGISLATURE. HE WHERE WE SOLVE THIS AND YET I DIDN'T HEAR I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG COLLEAGUES I DON'T THINK ANY OF US HEARD FROM YOU. BEFORE YOU PUT THIS BALLOT MEASURE ON C. DECIDED ON THE BALLOT PROCESS WITHOUT COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AWARENESS. I. I HEAR WHAT YOU SAID BUT I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS CHORE AND YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK I SHARE. I THINK WE HAVE A STRONG POINT OF AGREEMENT ON THE IMPACT OF LEAD POISONING ON COMMUTER COLOR AND LOG MUSICAL. A BUSINESS. I'M HEALTHY HOUSING ON HEALTHY HOUSE HAS BUT I THINK THE OF US IT'S WHO WANT TO PAY FOR THAT WHO WANT TO BE LIABLE FOR THAT. AND THE BALLOT INITIATIVE TAKES ONE PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. OUGHT TO PAY FOR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS CLEANUP INSPECTION A REMEDIATION. AND EDUCATION AND THE COMPANIES THAT PROFITED FROM THIS. OUGHT TO NOT HAVE TO PAY A DIME. AND IN FACT OUGHT TO HAVE EVEN THE SEMBLANCE SUPPLY BUILDING ON THE BOOKS WIPED OFF THE BOOKS. IN THIS BALLOT MEASURE. BY TWENTY VIEW AND THAT IS. YES BUT MY IN TERMS OF IT WILL BE UP TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY'RE NOT BE PASSED THIS INITIATIVE. WHATEVER LOOKS LIKE SO. DO YOU THINK THE CITIZENS OF TELL IF CALIFORNIA. OUGHT TO COMPLETELY ABSOLVE COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE PROFITED FROM POISONING CHILDREN. COMPLETELY ABSOLVE THEM AND AND PUT ON THEMSELVES OF FOUR BILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG. I WOULDN'T PUTTING IN THAT WAY AND I AM SURE HOWEVER AND BUT I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THIS IT IS OF OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU KNOW YOU WERE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAWSUIT AND THE IMPACT TO COMMUTE OF COLOR AND LET ME JUST CITE ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS IT CAME OUT THROUGH THAT LAWSUIT YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. THERE WAS A LEAD PAINT LOBBYIST IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THAT WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PUBLICITY PROBLEM. THE PUBLICITY PROBLEM OF LEAD POISONING AND IF I MAY QUOTE. ASIDE FROM THE KIDS WERE POISONED. IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THAT VERSE PUBLICITY. THE BASIC SOLUTION IS TO GET RID OF OUR SLUMS BUT EVEN UNCLE SAM CAN'T SWING THAT ONE. MOST OF THE CASES ARE IN NEGRO AND PER REGION FAMILIES AND HOW DOES ONE TACKLE THAT JOB. THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT WAS CIRCULATED. BY THE LEAD PAINT INDUSTRY THIS IS WHAT THEY KNEW IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THIS IS WHAT WE DID NOT LEARN UNTIL RECENT YEARS. HAVE YOU HAD YOU FEEL ABOUT WHO OUGHT TO PAY FOR THIS. IT IT. IT'S NOT WHO OUGHT TO PAY FOR THAT STATEMENT I'VE READ SEVERAL TIMES AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES. WHO FOR PROFIT MOTIVATED REASONS WOULD DENIGRATE WHOLE SWATHS OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY? ARE THEY WERE WHO THEY ARE. HAVING SAID THAT. IT'S BEEN MY. I GUESS LIFE'S WORK IS TO COUNTERACT THAT SORT OF THINKING. THAT EVERYBODY DESERVES A SAFE AND. AND CLEAN HOUSE. AND AND THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS AND. I CAN'T GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES I CAN LOOK AT TODAY AND GO FOR AND. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE. MY ORGANIZATIONS. POSITION WHICH IS MADE UP OF. SOME OF YOU AROUND. SOME A YEAR RESIDENTS. WELL I APPRECIATE. THE TESTIMONY THINK WE'LL AGREE TO DISAGREE AND THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE IN JUST A AND BY ASKING YOU KNOW HOW MANY KIDS SUFFER FROM LEAD POISONING EVERY YEAR. I. I DON'T KNOW. TENS OF THOUSANDS. TENS OF THOUSANDS. THANK MISTER THANK YOU SO I HAVE US WIECKOWSKI THEM AS REYES SINISTER GLORIA MISTER QUIRK. I'VE FOR MISTER ANDERSON ON THAT THE LIABILITY. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE. REALTORS HAVE TO DISCLOSE IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BUILT PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THAT YOU MAY HAVE LED PAIN AT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS MOVED THAT DATE BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY ONE SO OR IS SAYING THAT THE LIABILITY UNDER A PUBLIC NUISANCE. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT THAT THERE MAY BE NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE FOR THE HOUSES THAT WERE BUILT PRIOR TO NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. BUT THAT BETWEEN FIFTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT THE. THE CURRENT DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE WHY AM I WRONG. WELL I MY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT BROWN A CONSOLE THE REAL ESTATE. EXPERT IN THIS AREA. BESIDES MY OWN. IF HE SAID NO THESE ARE NEW CENTER REQUIREMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE EVEN THOUGH I DIE I AGREE THAT THE. FIFTY ONE AND EARLIER SIR TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE PHONE TWO ONE EIGHTY STILL. THE FIFTY ONE THROUGH EIGHTY ARE LEFT IN THE CLASS OF HOMES DESIGNATED AS A PUBLIC NUISANCE. AND HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT HAS TO BE DISCLOSED AS WELL AND THERE IS. A CHECKLIST THAT GOES ALONG ITS IS A ENTIRE DOCUMENT THAT. SHOWS WHAT NEED TO BE DONE I THINK YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH A CHECKLIST. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ON THOUGH. YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S AFFECTED UNDER THIS A COURT DECISION. WOULD BE REAP REQUIRING A CHECK MARK EVEN TO THE HOMES THAT ARE FIFTY ONE EIGHTY ONE OF THEM JUST. PRIOR TO US THANK YOU FOR TWO ONE. BUT I EXISTS. I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME LAW WORK TO NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CLARIFY WHAT THE DEED TO THE HOUSE IS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S. IF IF. THIS INITIATIVES. NOT GONNA CHANGE THAT WE WOULD STILL HAVE THE CURRENT DISCLOSURES THAT WE HAVE NOW RIGHT IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T UNDO DOUBLE THE WARNINGS THAT WE HAVE ON THEIR HOMES. NOT JUST REMOVES AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT DESIGNATION A PUBLIC NUISANCE. FROM THE HOUSE. OKAY AND. MISTER MARCH WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT YOU. THOUGHT IF THERE WOULD BE AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS HERE IN IN WE HAVE AS THE. TENANT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE WERE IF SOMEBODY GIVE SEVEN ORDER THAT THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE. YOU NEED THIS IS EVEN THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THAT DIVIDE. VIOLATION IS SO EXTENSIVE AND OF SUCH A NATURE THAT THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENT IS IN DANGER. THEY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE RELOCATION BENEFITS FROM THE OWNER AS SPECIFIED THIS ARTICLE SO IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF THIS IS. IF THE LOCAL. HEALTH. DIRECTOR SAYS THIS IS THIS NEED TO BE ABATED THEN THE LANDLORD WOULD BE LIABLE Y. WITH THAT INCREASE HOMELESSNESS. TO WORK WITH TWO WAY YOU GOT YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS THE FIRST ONE IS. RELOCATION THE RELOCATION ACCESS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID BAD BY ANY GOVERNMENTAL ACTION THAT YOU'RE FORCED OUT OF YOUR HOME. SOMEBODY MUST PAY IN SOME CASES. IT WOULD BE THE LANDLORD AT SOME CASES IT COULD BE A JURISDICTION WE SEE THAT IN DENVER EVEN AS WE SPEAK. THE HOUSING MARKET. I CAN SPEAK FOR MY OWN CITY. IS SO TIGHT IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT EVEN WITH RELOCATION FUNDS TO MOVE SOMEBODY WAITERS IN THEIRS SAME SCHOOL DISTRICT. WITHIN THIS. COUNCIL MEDIC DISTRICT AND. MANY LANDLORDS WILL NOT TAKE AND FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DESPITE WHAT THE SUBSIDY MAYBE IT SAY ONEROUS. SITUATION FOR OUR FOR YOUNG FAMILIES. WE'VE SEEN IT. IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS IT IS I THINK IT INCREASES BECAUSE THERE WILL BE SOME PEOPLE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE JOBS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND EVEN WITH FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR CITY ASSISTANCE. A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IT HAPPENS. AND. I I. I CAN GIVE YOU A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT I HAVE NOT AND. NOT IN THIS CITY I MEAN THAT THAT HERE BUT A DEMOCRAT OR RATHER WERE SUFFERING THE SAME ISSUES THAT YOU ARE. AND WHEN THE MARKET IS TIGHT. YOU CAN RAISE RENTS PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT YOU HAVE HOMELESSNESS. A YOU HAVE FAMILIES COULD HAVE ONE JOB OR TWO JOBS YOU STILL CAN'T AFFORD A PLACE OR SOMEONE WILL NOT RENT A PLACE OR IF THEY DO IT SO FAR AT THE CAN GET BACK TO WORK. I AM THAT WAS LOOKING THING AND MR DS YOU EAT YOU INDICATED THAT THAT SURE WHEN. WILLIAMS HAS WAS. RESPONSIBLE FOR POINT ZERO ONE% PERCENT OF THE LEAD THAT WAS IN CALIFORNIA THEY THEY. STOPPED. OR SELLING IT HERE IN NINETEEN THIRTY WHICH THAT THE LEAD ALL THE LEAD WORD JUST THE LEAD IN PAPERS THAT CALCULATION AND JUST ALL THAT CONCERNS. WE HAD LET GASOLINE IN. NINETEEN THIRTY YEAR. SHORT SO I'M SORRY IF I WAS BECAUSE IT ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT AND MY TO MOVE THE DECIMAL OVER I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT AND I'M INTENDED TO SEE ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT. AND IT WAS WITH RESPECT TO ALL LEAD THAT WAS BROUGHT INTO CALIFORNIA YES. I THINK AND SO THE CALCULATION THAT WENT INTO THE ORIGINAL FEE WAS BASED ON. LEAD THAT WAS THAT. DISCHARGED IN CALIFORNIA AS TO ALL USERS SO THAT'S WHERE THAT THAT'S NUMBER CHILDHOOD PREVENTION ACT NINETEEN NINETY ONE CORRECT CATCHER ALRIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. BUT ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER IS THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE DECISION. FOUND THAT INTERESTING BECAUSE. THAT'S PROBABLY THE TRUTH. BUT. THE DECISION ITSELF PROVIDE SO MUCH INFORMATION LIKE A PAGE TWO. SAYS LEAD IS A TOXIN THAT CAUSES. IRREVERSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE. CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS THE NUMBER ONE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM. CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. DO YOU AGREE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD KNOW THIS FACT. PERSONAL AYE. THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HEALTH EFFECTS ON CHILDREN AND THAT WE ARE SPECIFICALLY I APPRECIATE THAT BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT FACT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NO THAT FACT AND YES AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IT IN THE COURT'S DECISION. AT PAGE TWENTY SIX. WHAT THE COURT DID DISTRICT THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS BECAUSE BIG THE THREE YOU DON'T? PAINT COMPANIES APPEALED THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION. BUT THE APPEALS COURT SAID THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CLAIMS MADE BY THE DEFENDANTS WHICH IS A THREE. COMPANIES. REGARDING KNOWLEDGE. THE COURT SAID. THE TRIAL COURT STATEMENT OF DECISION EXPRESSLY FOUND THAT THE THREE DEFENDANTS HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOUSE HERDS OF LEAD PAINT. INCLUDING CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING WHEN THEY PRODUCED. MARKETED SOLD AND PROMOTED LEAD PAINT FOR RESIDENTIAL USE. DO YOU THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THE CITIZENS THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE AWARE OF. CERTAINLY THE A EVERYONE TO BE AWARE OF EVERY COURT DECISION BUT WE DISAGREE. WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE COURT THERE AND BECAUSE. AND YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY DURING THE APPEAL TO PROVIDE ALL OF EUROPE THAT YOUR EVIDENCE IS CORRECT. THE WELL THERE IT THE STANDARD OF REVIEW IN THE APPELLATE COURT AS YOU KNOW WAS NOT TO LOOK AT NEW EVIDENCE OR EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT DID NOT ALLOW THE PRESIDENT. PRESENTED AT COURT RATHER WAS LOOKING AT THE COURTS A DETERMINATION WHETHER IT HAD EVIDENCE TO LOOK AT SO I HAD A TRIAL COURT THAT REVIEWED ALL OF THE EVIDENCE. OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION. THE TRIAL COURT HEARD ALL OF THE EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY THE PAINT COMPANIES. BUT YOU ALL COULD PRODUCE IS THAT CORRECT. THE TRIAL COURT. WELL THE TRIAL COULD TOOK IN A CERTAIN EVIDENCE AND CERTAIN EVIDENCE I CHOSE TO LOOK AT CERTAIN EVIDENCE SUCH AS NOT. SO THE THE APPELLATE COURT THEN REVIEWED BECAUSE YOU WERE SAY WELL NO THERE WERE AND THERE WERE ERRORS IN THE WAY THAT THE TRIAL COURT REVIEWED. IT TOOK IN THE EVIDENCE AND IT WAS THE APPELLATE COURTS POSITION THAT AFTER REVIEWING. THAT THE TRIAL COURT WAS CORRECT IN THEIR DECISION. IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE COURT EXPRESSLY FOUND THE DEFENDANTS THAT'S THE THREE. PAINT COMPANIES. LEARNED ABOUT THE HARMS OF LEAD EXPOSURE THROUGH ASSOCIATION SPONSORED CONFERENCES. THE COURT EXPRESSLY FOUND THE DEFENDANTS KNEW IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THAT THE DANGERS OF LET'S PAINT TWO CHILDREN WERE NOT LIMITED TO THEIR TOYS EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE. THE COURT EXPRESSLY FOUND THAT THE DEFENDANTS KNEW BOTH. THAT HIGH LEVEL EXPOSURE TO LEAD AND IN PARTICULAR LEAD PAINT. WAS FATAL. AND THAT LOWER LEVEL LEAD EXPOSURE HARM TO CHILDREN. FINALLY THE COURT ALSO FOUND THAT BY THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THE DEFENDANTS AND THAT'S THE THREE OF YOU. THREE OF THE PAINT COMPANIES. NEW THAT LEAD PAINT USED IN THE INTERIORS OF HOMES WOULD DETERIORATE DETERIORATE AND THAT LEAD DUST RESULTING FROM THIS DETERIORATION WOULD POISON CHILDREN. AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY. WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD KNOW THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL COURT. AND THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THAT THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES. NEW OF THE DANGER AND STILL EXPOSED OUR CHILDREN TO THE X. TO EXPOSURE TO LEAD PAINT IS THIS AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOULD HERE MISTER OF THE YARD I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN YET NO THEIR LOOK I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT. THE IN THE PAST THAT THIS WAS. A PROBLEM THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN AND HAS BEEN ADDRESS I THINK TO THE POINT WHERE. YOU KNOW THE LEAD AINT AND PAINT OR IS NOW NO LONGER EXISTED. AND THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S NOW AT LEVELS THAT ARE TO TO MISTER DEEDS THIS POINT I THINK POINT ONE ZERO. I I MEAN I I THINK YES AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING CORRECTLY INTO WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY WITH THIS DECISION. AND HOW IS IT NOT ONLY GONNA FACT HOMEOWNERS BUT HOW'S IT GONNA AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND HOW IS IT HOW HOW IS IT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DISPLACE FOLKS. ON AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS TO LOOK AT THIS AND THE POINT THAT I WAS TRYING TO MAKE EARLIER IS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS AS IT IN IN A WAY. IS HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT OUR CONSTITUENTS HOW IT'S GONNA AFFECT YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND AND AND WE'RE GOING ANABSOLUTE YOUR POINT YES WELL I THINK WE SHOULD LET PEOPLE KNOW. I DO YOU BELIEVE THEY ON. THAT. THIS THREE PAINT COMPANIES. FOUND BY THE COURTS TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE. SHOULD NOW BE EXONERATED AND NOT HAVE TO PAY A PENNY I THINK WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS I THINK THAT OF THE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. AND COME TOGETHER TO DECIDE SPECTACULARLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHAT IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION. VERY SPECIFICALLY THE COURT FOUND THAT. OVER JUST OVER ONE POINT ONE TO ALMOST A ONE POINT TWO BILLION. IS WHAT NEEDED TO BE PAID BY THE THREE. PAINT COMPANIES. DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD DECIDE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE THE PAINT COMPANY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. I I I I AGAIN I I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S WHO I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO COME TOGETHER. AND WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE CONSTITUENTS A CALIFORNIA AND HOW DOES THAT WORK. AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY TO ME YOU KNOW YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. THAT THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE. BE EXONERATED AND THATTHE BILL BE PICKED UP. BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AGAIN I THINK WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IS WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER WE ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WE ALL. WHAT WOULD THAT WHETHER IT'S THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER IT'S CONSTITUENTS WHETHER IT'S THIRD PARTY GROUPS? WITH THEIR IT'S THAT THE PAINT COMPANIES THEMSELVES ON. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE ON THE LINK DO YOU DO YOU WOULD YOU AGREE THAT AT LEAST THE BEGINNING. SHOULD BE THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION PAID BY THE PAINT COMPANIES AND THEREAFTER IF THERE'S SOMETHING MORE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MEETS TO DO WILL CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ADDRESS THAT. SURE I NOT A PRETTY TO NUMBERS AND WHAT WOULD BE I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT THE COURT DECISION. WHAT WOULD THE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BE FOUND IN THE COURT DECISION? I I'M NOT NO I'M NOT BACK BUT LIKE I SAID BUT I THINK WHAT I'M SORRY MR OF YEAH. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THE COURT FOUND THAT THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES SHOULD OKAY. I'M SORRY YEAH SO YES I'M BUT YOU DO KNOW THAT SO YOU'RE ASKING ME YES I'M ASKING YOU DO KNOW THAT THE COURTS FOUND. AND. THAT THAT THEY WERE TO NOW PAY JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS YES SORRY I I. THINK YOU. AND IF YOU DO YOU BELIEVE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE COURTS FOUND. MAKE THAT FINDING AND THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS. CONFIRMED THAT FINDING. YOU BELIEVE THAT. THREE POINT COMPANIES SHOULD NOT PAY THEM IN FACT. IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT IS IT IS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD FOOT THE BILL. TO PAY FOR THAT INSTEAD NOT KNOW WHAT I WHAT I AGAIN WHAT I THINK. YOU KNOW I WILL. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION. YOU NO HIGH I IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO SEIZE DISCUSSES SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AND HAVE WE HAVE TO WORK OUT TO I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE THE PROPOSITION WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT THE INITIATIVE WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT. YOU KNOW WE WE. WE COULD HAVE TALKED TO DIFFERENT FOLKS. BUT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE'RE AT AND I THINK THAT YOU SET IT BECAUSE YOU SAID WE ALL SHOULD. DID WE ALL DO THAT BEFORE THE INITIATIVE WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT. I WASN'T TO I'M WHERE I WAS AND BEFORE SO IT. IF YOU DON'T MIND I CAN ANSWER AT TWO PARTS OF THAT. NUMBER ONE IS AS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A RECENT SETTLEMENT WITH AND I'LL INDUSTRIES WHICH PAID SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF THAT IS GOING TO GO TO. ARE THE TRIAL LAWYERS OF THE CASES YOU KNOW THE COURT DECIDED THAT NO MONEY SHOULD GO TO THE TRIAL LAWYERS. AS A RESULT OF THE CASE BUT TWENTY MILLION OF THAT IS GOING TO THAT. SO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ONE OF THE PARTIES WHO HAD AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE OF THE LEAD PIGMENTS IN HIGH IN CALIFORNIA. IS BEING LED OUT BY THE PLASTER STICKS IS FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE CALCULATION THE REPRESENTATIONS THEY MADE TO THE COURT LAST WEEK BEFORE THE COURT. BOB THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS A WHAT OF THAT THAT JUSTIFIED THAT LOWER NUMBER BEING PRESENTED TO THE COURT AS BEING ADEQUATE FOR ONE OF THE PARTIES TO. UP SETTLE FOR. AND SO WELL YES. YOU ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT OF WHAT THE COURT FOUND AND AS YOU KNOW THE COURT IS ON REMAND TO. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THAT ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION TO CUT OUT THE PROPER USER POSTS NINETEEN FIFTY. A PRE NINETEEN FIFTY HOMES STILL LEAVING THAT. DESIGNATION OF THAT THE COURT HAD FOUND A PUBLIC NUISANCE TO EXIST IN NINETEEN FIFTY TO NINETEEN EIGHTY HOMES ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. IS TO CREATE A FUND THAT ALL PROPERTY OWNERS CONFINED FOR SUBSTANDARD HOUSING AS YOU KNOW THEIR NUMBER AND I KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OTHER AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN SEE HEARING ABOUT HOW I GREW UP THE KIND OF HOUSING THAT I GREW UP IN IT BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THAT ISSUES OF LETTER ENDEMIC TO SUBSTANDARD HOUSING ONES AT ALL OF US SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON I THINK THE IDEA OF THE INITIATIVE IS TO PROVIDE MORE HOPE OF FUNDING FOR SUBSTANDARD HOUSING. BUT WITH RESPECT TO COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION THAT EXTENDS ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY WHEN THE WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE WANTED TO HOLD THESE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE. AND IT WAS THE COURT THAT SAID THAT THE LAWS OF THE LEGISLATURE MADE AND THE FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND IN PLACE WAS INSUFFICIENT IF YOU YOU MADE A POINT OF. MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. SURE THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'M. JOHN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AYE BADGES CALLING UP THE MOST PLEASANT THING YOU'VE EVER LET LIVE THROUGH. BUT I YOU KNOW I I DO HONOR AND RESPECT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HERE. TO TO GIVE US SOME INFORMATION ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE. I GUESS AFTER THIS IN THIS TESTIMONY AYE I'M CURIOUS TO UNDERSTAND STRATEGY OF THE INDUSTRY. A BECAUSE WHAT I'VE HEARD I THINK THAT MOST DIRECT REQUEST OF THIS BODY IS FOR LEGISLATIVE FOR POLICY INTERVENTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AT THE SAME TIME. THE INDUSTRY'S FILED ABOUT MEASURE AND QUALIFYING SIGNATURE OR CLICKING SIGNATURES NOW TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT THIS NOVEMBER. BY SIMULTANEOUSLY THERE'S AN APPEAL THAT IS MOVING FOR TO THE US SUPREME COURT IS AT ALL CRACKED. THAT IS CORRECT SO. CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE WHICH OF THESE THREE DID YOU ACTUALLY WANTED PURSUE SO WELL BUT IT IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION AND I'D AND AND I WANT IT. ANSWERED A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE CHRONOLOGICALLY. AT THE TIME WERE AND WHEN WE WERE FACED WITH THE ORIGINAL DECISION FROM THE COURT. FOR A DECISION FROM THE APPELLATE COURT WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE APPELLATE COURT WAS GOING TO SIDE CERTAINLY. AS THAT I AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTION THERE ARE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WENT UP ON APPEAL SO WHEN WE STARTED THE PROCESS OF THE INITIATIVE. THERE WERE STILL SOME UNKNOWNS NUMBER ONE IS WHAT WOULD THE COURT DECIDE FOR EXAMPLE NO WAY TO PROTECT THAT THE APPELLATE COURT WOULD DECIDE THAT NINETEEN FIFTY TO NINETEEN EIGHTY HOMES WOULD BE CUT OUT. OF GETTING AN ABATEMENT PLAN YET LEFT WITH THE DESIGNATION OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE SO THAT WAS ONE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED AND JUST LAST WEEK WE LEARNED OF THE OTHER CHANGE. IN TERMS OF THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO THE JURISDICTIONS IN THE TWENTY TO THE TRIAL LAWYERS. WE ALSO ALSO DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT. I'M SORRY CAN I JUST. I DON'T THINK IT ADVANTAGE YOUR ARGUMENT TODAY CONTINUE FURTHER THAT THE TRIAL LAWYERS FEES YOU SIR ARE ATTORNEY CORRECT YEAH THE ONLY REASON TO BE HERE CRAFT YEAH THE REASON I THE REASON I MENTION IT IS THE COURT DECISION AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. DID NOT. FROM THE COURTS. IF THEY GO BACK TO THE LOCAL JUST JURISDICTIONS AND COLLECT FROM THE JACKET FROM THE FOR. MIDDLEMAN OF ONE POINT ONE SIX BILLION. OR THE AMOUNT THAT THE THAT THE TRIAL COURT MAY READJUST THAT NUMBER TO. THE COURT SAID IT WAS BOUND NOT TO AWARD OR ALLOW THE JURISDICTIONS TOWARD ANY OF THAT MONEY SO THE REASON I RAISE IT AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE RECESSED DISRESPECTFUL ANY ATTORNEY. THE IDEA IS THOUGH THAT WHEN A SETTLEMENT OCCURS AND MONEY DOES GO. NOT ONLY TO THE JURISDICTION BUT TO USE TO BE TO PAY ATTORNEY'S FEES. THEN IT YOU KNOW IT'S RELEVANT TO HOW MUCH MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING. TO THE PROGRAM THAT WILL BE IN PLACE AND I DON'T. THAT MONEY IS DESIGNATED SPECIFICALLY FOR ABATEMENT AGAIN IT CAN BE USED FOR WHATEVER IT IS BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO LEARN HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE YEARS SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE OTHER THERE'S A NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT HAPPENED FROM THE TIME. WHEN WE FILED THE INITIATIVE. AND ALSO WHEN OF THIS. BODY CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF HOUSING INITIATIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN ALSO I ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS BY THIS BODY. SO YES THERE IS A CONSIDERATION HAS TO GOING TO PLAY FOR THAT PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE I. DO DOES DOES THE INITIATIVE CONTINUE. IS THERE A BETTER LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE WHICH WON AN. THANK LOOK WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER POLICY COMES FROM LEGISLATURE'S AND LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN A COW MORE CONSTITUENCIES THAT COURTS TO JUST BY DEFINITION FOR EXAMPLE IN THE COURT CASE. PROPERTY OWNERS WERE NOT ALLOWED. TO BE PART OF THE COURT CASE THEY WHAT WE TRIED TO ADD THEM TO THE CASE TO HAVE A SAY IN WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH RESPECT TO A BIG IN PROGRAMS. OR ANYTHING THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE CASE AND THE PLAINTIFFS JURISDICTIONS JOINED IN. OPPOSING THAT EFFORT SO THERE WERE CHANGES SO YES WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. BUT THE MOST THE CORE PART OF THE INITIATIVE. IS TO NOT USE THE THAT THAT MONIKER OF PUBLIC NUISANCE. TO ADDRESS A HAZARD THAT THIS BODY HAD ALREADY DETERMINED HOW IT WAS DONE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SUBSTANDARD HOUSING THAT IS NECESSARY. IT IS THE IN THE IDEA IS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S BEING LOOKED AT AS A BAIL OUT BUT THE IDEA IS THAT EVERYONE AGREES MORE MONEY NEEDS TO BE PUT TOWARD SUBSTANDARD HOUSING. AND THE ADVANTAGES ARE CLEAR AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. SO BUT I DON'T THINK YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION BECAUSE I'M UNCLEAR I RECOGNIZE YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT IT. LA OPTIONS AVAILABLE TIA BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE EITHER GONNA PURSUE THE PEEL WITH VIGOR YOU'RE GONNA PURSUE INITIATIVE A BIGGER ARE YOU GONNA SIT DOWN. AS. JOHN WAS SAYING ABOUT TRYING TO WORK OUT A DEAL OR WORK OUT SOME LEGISLATIVE FIX. I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE THAT THE ASSEMBLY RECENTLY PASSED TWO BILLS THAT TO ADDRESS LEAD PAINT. AB TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE IN AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE IS THE INDUSTRY SUPPORT OF EITHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION CENTER HERE ASKING FOR LEGISLATIVE FIXES. UP SO IT AGAIN. ALL THREE OF THESE DATES ARE TENDING TO CONVERGE AS YOU MENTIONED THE SUPREME COURT THE INITIATIVE AND. UP VASTLY WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ONE OF THE FOLKS THAT KEVIN AND I WERE TO THAT I KNOW THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WORKED ON AS WELL AS. WORK WE DID WITH THE FORMER CIVIL RIGHTS LET I WORKED WITH DOCTOR DOROTHY HEIGHT THAT NASH FORMER CHAIRMAN NATIONAL COUNCIL OF NEGRO WOMEN. SHE WORKED IN OPPOSE THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF. THE. BREAK IT GAVE TO LANDLORDS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS SHE SAID TO ME ABOUT POLICY IS ONE OR NOTED QUOTES WAS IF THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT AND THAT'S RIGHT IN THE TIME. SO WE GOT DEADLINES BUT THAT'S ALL IT'S ALL THE TIME AND PLACE WHERE WE CAN TRY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CONSIDER ANY OPTIONS SO THE. INDIAN INDUSTRY IS FUNDING THE SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT AS THE FBI IN. AS A MEANS TO FURTHER LEGISLATIVE FIX IN THE CAPITAL. WELL WE'VE COLLECTED SIGNATURES BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE. IS ONE METHOD OF APPROACHING BUT YOU'LL ABANDONED RESOLUTELY TO TAKE ACTION. I I THINK IT WOULD BE CRAZY NOT TO THINK OF YOU HAVING THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY COME UP WITH A MORE ELEGANT SOLUTION. THEN OTHER ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW BUT THE BILLS THAT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY SO FAR NOT SATISFACTORY TO DENNIS. I'M I I KNOW OF TO AND I THINK IT'S ASSEMBLY MEN'S SHOES AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN MOANS. TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHICH AGAIN ARE ONES OF THE LEAD TO THE ASSEMBLY I CHOSE TO PURSUE AND I KNOW AT LEAST WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S LOW MOANS. IT BASICALLY CODIFIES THE IDEA OF USING PUBLIC NUISANCE SO WE THINK. SOME FOLKS BELIEVE THAT MAYBE IT SUFFERS THE SAME PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC NUISANCE WE'RE NOT HERE TO. ARGUE ABOUT THAT ARE NOT ASSEMBLY IS OBVIOUSLY AGREED WITH THAT AND AS WELL WITH. ASSEMBLY MEN CHOOSE THERE ARE A NUMBER. OF. PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES WE'D LIKE TO EXPLORE FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS WITH THAT OR NOT. AGAIN NOT HERE TO ARGUE IT BUT WE WOULD. WE SEE THERE ARE NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND AGAIN THAT MOST ELEGANT OF SOLUTIONS COME FROM LEGISLATURE'S AND AGAIN IT'S THE ONLY STATE LEGISLATURE. THAT REALLY APPROACH THE ISSUE STARTING THREE DECADES AGO OR ALMOST THREE DECADES AGO WHEN I THINK THAT'S A FOUND POINT RELATIVE TO THE SUGGESTION THAT ARE ONGOING CONVERSATION IS WITH WHILE THIS IS GOING TO. XIN GOING ON FOR DECADES THE COURT IS RENDERED OF A DECISION YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS TO PURSUE AN APPEAL. I JUST FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT THE USE OF OUR. PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC TOOLS TO EFFECTUATE REALLY WHAT IS A BUSINESS DECISION. AND I THINK TAKE IN THE CONTEXT THE COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT OTHERS ARE GETTING. AS RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF WHEN YOU KNOW THE IF IF EVERY DOLLAR IS NOT GOING TO LEAD ABATEMENT. OR CERTAINLY EVERY DOLLAR BEING SPENT ON A SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT COULD CERTAINLY GO DEBATE. LET AND COMMUNITIES CORRECT I MEAN THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE TRIAL LAWYERS ARE GETTING THROUGH THEIR. THROUGH THEIR FEES ARE GOING TO PALE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT A SPINNAKER TELEVISION COMMERCIALS AND MAILERS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO IT'S DIFFICULT AS A LEGISLATOR. TO FILL THE INDUSTRY SO IS ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION ON IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING MONEY ON THIS PARTICULAR EFFORT I REALIZE IT CREATES LEVERAGE. BUT THAT'S NOT A. I SIGNED ACTUAL. DE. WELL I USUALLY STYLE AGAIN. YEAH AND THANK YOU THANK YOU I DID NOT HEAR COST IN THERE THAT NO YEAH I SAID MR BECAUSE CHEN. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK IN THE MISS THEM. I AM VERY DISTRESSED. THAT THE PAINT COMPANIES. BROUGHT FORWARD THE IDEA THAT THERE'S INDIVIDUAL JEOPARDY. FOR HOMEOWNERS NO ONE UP HERE BELIEVES THAT I CAN ONLY THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO THE PUBLIC TO PROMOTE YOUR. INITIATIVE LET ME JUST READ FROM THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION PAGE ONE THIRTY FOUR. PLAINTIFF CONTENDS THAT THE JUDGMENT IMPROPERLY AFFECTS THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS WITHOUT NOTICE. IT DOES NOT. HE ABATEMENT PLAN ORDERED BY THE TRIAL COURT. IS PREMISED ON VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION BY PROPERTY OWNERS. NO PROPERTY OWNERS WILL BE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR FOR THEIR RIGHTS WILL NOT BE INVOLUNTARILY IMPACTED. PLAINTIFF INSISTS THE COURTS ABATEMENT ORDER HAS DECLARED A NUISANCE ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES WITHOUT NOTICE TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS. NOT SO. THE TRIAL COURT. WHETHER DEFENDANTS TO ABATE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE THEY'D CREATED BUT IT DOT DID NOT. IDENTIFY ANY SPECIFIC PROPERTIES THE ABATEMENT PLAN ITSELF IS JUST IS. DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE. INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES UPON WHICH THE DEFENDANTS PUBLIC NUISANCE EXISTS. I. THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP IS THE IDEA THAT MISTER ANDERSON BROUGHT OUT THAT SOMEHOW. IT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL. RESPONSIBILITIES LACK OF INSURANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS. THIS IS BEEN STATED BY THE PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE BEFORE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THIS IS NOT THE CASE. SAID JUNE BARLOW THE ORGANIZATION'S GENERAL COUNSEL. HE SAID THE STATE ALREADY REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF LEAD PAINT DURING HOME SALES SO THE RISK IS BEEN REFLECTED IN PROPERTY VALUES FOR YEARS. BARLOW ARE ALSO SAID IN THE CLOSING STATEMENT OF. NOVEMBER'S COURT DECISION UP THAT LED PAIN IN GENERAL IS BEING LABELED. A PUBLIC NUISANCE NOT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT IN INDIVIDUAL HOMES. IT'S DECEPTIVELY CALLED THE HEALTHY HOMES AND SCHOOLS ACTED TO TAXPAYER RIP RIP OFF SAID THE LA TIMES. LOOK. IT WILL BE PAID FOR THE TAXPAYERS BUT WE'RE NOT INCREASING. THE AMOUNT OF TAX THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING. MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT BONDS ARE BUT BASICALLY THEIR CALL ON THE GENERAL FUND IN THIS I SAID EARLIER. THIS MONEY IS GONNA COME AWAY FROM MONEY THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR HOMELESS. THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR OF MEDICAL CARE. THAT'S WHERE THIS MONEY WILL COME FROM IF THIS BOND MEASURES PASSED. THE OTHER THING IS I CAN ONLY THINK THAT THE LAST STATEMENT OF THE STATE OF THE. STATEMENT OF. UP PRESIDENT OBAMA IS TAKEN TERRIBLY OUT OF CONTEXT. WHAT HE WHAT I BELIEVE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T? IDENTIFY KIDS WHO HAPPEN TO. IN A PARTICULAR TOWN. AS BAD KIDS OR HANDICAPPED KIDS HOWEVER. KIDS WHO WERE POISONED BY LEAD. CAN'T REVERSE THAT. ARM THE MOST YOU CAN DO IF A KID REALLY HAS A VERY HIGH LEAD LEVELS AND IN VERY TO TREAT FEW CASES THIS IS DONE YOU CAN TO CHEER LEADING. WHICH REMOVES LED FROM THE SYSTEM BUT THAT'S THAT'S RARELY DONE THE DAMAGE IS DONE ALREADY. AND WE KNOW WHAT IT DOES. AND IN FACT. ONE OF THE THEORIES OF WHY CRIME SUDDENLY WENT DOWN IN THE NINETIES IS BECAUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WE STOPPED USING LED GASOLINE LEAD PAINT IT CETERA. SO. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD SUCH DECEPTIVE THAMES. A TESTIMONY MY LIFE. AND YEAH IT TAKES A LOT TO GET ME ANGRY YOU'VE GOT ME ANGRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUSLIM OF THE. THANK YOU AYE THAT ONE I THINK MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THAT THEY HAVE HIGHLIGHTED. THAT THE FEELINGS THERE ARE TWO. TO SOME OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD. AND IT WITHOUT GOING TO FLEE TO TO FOR INTO A THINK THAT THERE'S ONE QUESTION THAT WE ALL TRY TO REPHRASE IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND. Y. A. ONE OF THE APPROACHES THE BALLOT INITIATIVE APPROACH. ON THE SCENE IS A GOOD IDEA AND I'D LIKE TO ASK HOUSE. MR MARKSMAN AND MR OUTLOOK THAT I'LL BE ARE. AYE TO PLEASE TELL ME WHY YOU THINK. GOOD IDEA BECAUSE YOU BOTH CAME EN. I SAYING THAT YOU SUPPORT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE CORRECT. YES. OKAY SO YOU DO SUPPORT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE SPEND THEIR FOR YOU SUPPORT. THAT THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR COMES FROM OUR GENERAL FUND WHICH IS IN TURN THE TAXPAYER. WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AFTER THE COURTS? THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ANOTHER. ENTITY THAT SHOULD HAVE PAID FOR THIS. BECAUSE I AM A FIRST I THINK. WITH THAT THE PUBLIC. THAT DECISION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY IN THE POINT THAT I JUST. OKAY IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY SO IN YOUR MIND. GOOD PUBLIC POLICY YOU SAID YOU SUPPORT THIS YOU SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT THIS IS GONNA COME OUT OF GENERAL FUNDS THERE FOR THE TAXPAYERS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY YES OR NO. IF IT IF IT GET SOME RESULTS THAT'S GONNA BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA YES. SO YOU BELIEVE IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS. PACIFIC WE SAID SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY PETE COMPANIES. AGAIN IF IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC POLICY OF CALIFORNIANS AND IS THAT A YES OR NO. YES OKAY SO YOU YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA WHY DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THE TAXPAYERS. ON THE LINE FOR THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE GOOD. PUBLIC POLICY IMPLEMENTED FOR THAT ON AND WOOD AND. LOOK OUT FOR THEIR WELL BEING SO I THINK IF THAT IS AN AVID MUSIC THAT ENOUGH SO THEREFORE YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COURTS WITHOUT FOR THE WELL BEING. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I I CAN YOU'RE GOING TO GET MY TWO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS FROM THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE AND I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS LEFT THAT AND WAS THOUGHT OF. HOLISTICALLY WHERE. THAT COULD BE WHERE IT SHOULD BE DONE IN A LEGISLATURE OR IN A BODY WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING A BALLOT INITIATIVE THERE FOR THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS NOT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO ALL OF THIS ABOUT RICE BEANS. A GREAT PLACE FOR A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY KINDS YOU CAME IN HERE SAYING YOU DON'T SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPORTING. A BALLOT INITIATIVE. WELL I MASSIVE BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT WOULD BE THERE'D STRUCTURE UP IF YOU DON'T MIND IF PEOPLE THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVE THAT IT'S A GOOD DECISION THEY WILL DECIDE THAT. WHEN THEY GO VOTE SO SO YES IT IS GOOD. AYE HAVING YOU TO LOOK AT TO TO EXPLORE NOW YOU KNOW. YEAH AND IT AND IT IF THE IN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WILL DECIDE WHAT THAT DECISION. WHEN THEY VOTE. YES I BELIEVE INITIATIVE IS A GOOD IDEA I THINK. IN MANY STATES IN MANY MUNICIPALITIES WERE ALL LOOKING AT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO DO BOND ISSUES FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR EDUCATION. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE CITIZENS WILL MAKE A DECISION UPON THAT THE DEPENDING UPON HOW IT'S PRESENTED TO MISTER MARCHMENT AND. IT BUT THERE'S A ONE DIFFERENCE THAT THE COURTS ACTUALLY SAID. THE PAINT COMPANIES SHOULD PAY FOR THIS SO IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION. RIGHT. WELL I DON'T WERE NOT DID THIS IS A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT OVERTURNS. EIGHTEEN YEARS OF TESTIMONY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF EVIDENCE. I UNDERSTAND ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA MY POINT IS THAT THIS CITIZENS WILL MAKE A DECISION I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE. THAT THE INITIATIVE THAT ONLY AND THAT INCLUDES LEAD BASED PAINT AND OTHER HAZARDS ISSUES IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING IS A GOOD IDEA. PERIOD. I CAN DISASSOCIATE WITH THE COURT SAID BUT IF. IF THE CITIZENS SAY YES WE BELIEVE THIS WERE FULLY INFORMED ABOUT HEALTH ISSUES BUT YOU JUST SAID EARLIER COMMENTS IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE CITIZENS ARE NOT FULLY INFORMED. I MEAN THAT'S. WHAT I'M SAYING WHAT I JUST SAID THIS IS MONEY THAT IS HERE PRESENTING LET ME LET ME FINISH? I BELIEVE THAT HE INFORMED CITIZEN. IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX DOLLARS. AND IF. PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE UNINFORMED ABOUT THE COURT DECISION UNINFORMED ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF LEAD. WELL LET'S DO THAT AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THOSE THOSE. EDUCATIONAL. CAMPAIGNS THAT THIS IS WHAT IT IS PRO AND AGAINST. PEOPLE WILL IT WILL DECIDE AND. IF. IF IT FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE TO NOT ONLY INCLUDE. LEAD BASED PAINT ABATEMENT. AND OTHER THINGS I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND YOU'VE SEEN IT YOU KNOW A NUMBER. IN A COUPLE OF THOSE MOVE FORWARD BUT AND. I MEAN THERE IS A BODY THAT DOES NOT FEEL. THAT THE GENERAL FUND OR THE TAXPAYER SHOULD BE. AND WHILE I RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE YOU BRING ON. ANY YOU KNOW ALL PERSPECTIVES ARE ARE LISTEN TO I THINK THAT THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE AND. THAT YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN YEARS I AM SOMEONE WHO WORKS FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT ANY COUNTY AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT HOMES TO DO BI LINGUAL TRANSLATION. FOR AYE FAMILIES WHO WERE IMPACTED BY LEAD POISONING. AND THERE IS TRAINS THERE AND. WHAT I AM MOST TROUBLE THAT IS THAT THERE'S AN INCONSISTENCY IN WHAT THAT? PAINT COMPANIES ARE BRINGING TO S. IT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST METHOD ON IN THE END THERE IT THIS IS YOU KNOW I THINK THE PUBLIC AT NEW SINCE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IS. REALLY ONLY A TALKING POINT TO GET TO THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT E. SENSUALLY PUTTS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. ON THE LINE FOR THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. TWO BILLION IN THE PRINCIPLE AND ONE POINT NINE IN THE INTERESTS AND THAT IS A PROBLEM. AND SO I A. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WILL TRY TO CONTINUE TO MOVE TOGETHER IF THAT BUNDLED IN FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IS NOT ADDRESSED. AND I KNOW THAT AS I GOT INVOLVED WITH THIS INITIATIVE AS I GOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BILL AND IT WAS REALLY COMING FROM A PLACE OF. ON BELIEVING THAT THE COURTS HAD ALL THE EVIDENCE OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND MORE EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED IN THIS YOU KNOW TO OUR. HEARING A TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I HOPE THAT THIS BODY WILL CONTINUE AS MEMBERS AS LEGISLATORS CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WHAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CALIFORNIANS. BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT HAVING THEM ON THE LINE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PAINT COMPANIES MEN OF THE P. COMPANIES ARE ON THE LINE FOR THAT THREE POINT NINE BILLION THROUGH THAT INITIATIVE. IS THE BEST THING. AND SO I I HOPE THAT THIS BODY AGAIN AND MOVES FORWARD IN CONSIDERING THAT AS UP. IN THE NEXT WEEKS. THANK YOU MISTER OR MR IS HERE TO FOLLOW QUESTION AND THEN ANSWER TO HOW TO FOLLOW AFTER AFTER THIS TESTIMONY I HAD ONE QUESTION SINCE THE. COURT DECISION WAS. THAT THE THREE POINT COMPANIES WERE TO PAY ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION. THE. INITIATIVE IS FOR TWO BILLION. I'VE TALKED ABOUT TOPO. HAVING COMPROMISE. WHY DIDN'T YOU CONSIDERED DOING THE PROPOSITION FOR JUST POINT EIGHT FIVE WITH THE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BEING PAID FOR BY? THOSE. CORD HAD FOUND WERE LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE. GALGIANI DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. ALL DEFERRED TO TIME THAT IT. SO THE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE. INITIATIVE WAS FILED PRIOR TO THE COURTS. RULING FROM THE APPELLATE COURT WHICH. US REMANDED THE CASE TO REDUCE THE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR AMOUNT. AND SO AS YOU KNOW THAT IS NOW WITHIN THE TRIAL COURT. AND THE PROCEDURE FOR FINDING A NEW DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WILL BE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A RANGE OF VALUES THAT I GO TO MUCH LESS THAN HALF. TWO. I THINK SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION BUT DEPENDING ON WHOSE NUMBERS YOU LOOK AT IS ALSO IS BUTTON PUT ON DELAY BECAUSE OF THE SETTLEMENT. WITH AND I'LL INDUSTRIES UP SO WE WON'T HAVE A NEW NUMBER STILL WITH THAT SO THE NUMBER THAT WAS PUT IN AS PART OF THE INITIATIVE. WAS WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OF THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION SO THAT'S ONE REASON SO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT ONCE THE APPELLATE COURT. MAKES THAT DETERMINATION THE FINAL NUMBER THAT THAT AMOUNT SHOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE THREE. PAINT COMPANIES AND THEN THE REMAINDER GO GOOD BE PART OF THE. IT'S BEING OUSTED THAT PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU IF. THE ATTORNEYS HAVE SHARED WITH YOU THE CALCULATIONS THAT WENT INTO THE REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT LACKEY JUST ASK I'M JUST ASKING WELL IN WONDERLAND IF THERE IS A DECISION. AS TO HOW MUCH OF THE PAINT COMPANIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHETHER IT'S HALF A BILLION OR ONE BILLION OR ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION. WOULD YOU AGREE THEN THAT THAT AMOUNT BE PAID BY THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES AND THE REMAINDER OF THE BAR OF THE BOND OF THE. THAT OF THE BOND TO BE PAID FOR BY THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW. AND I JUST WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION THANK YOU. TO. I JUST HAD ONE FOLLOW UP WHERE WE JUST GOT A DOCUMENT DROPPED IN FRONT OF OUR OFFICE. AND. IT'S IS TRIAL ATTORNEYS TAKING MONEY FROM CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS IN A SETTLEMENT DEAL SO YOU'VE YOU'VE PUT THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. SQUARELY IN. IN YOUR SITE SO I THE QUESTION TO TO MISTER DS WHAT IS YOUR BILL RIGHT. WHAT'S MY BILLABLE RATE YOUR BILL PERRY. EIGHT. IT'S A RATE THAT I CHARGE CLIENTS FOR MY WORK AYE SIR WE GET THAT ONE I JUST GUESS AT YOUR BILL PARADE IS MAYBE SO. OKAY OF THIS GUEST BECAUSE THAT IS FOR JONES DAY ATTORNEYS THAT'S A PRETTY AVERAGE RATE FOR SOMEONE OF YOUR BACKGROUND AND YOUR EXPERIENCE. SO FOR TALKING ABOUT A LAWSUIT THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS AND LET'S ASSUME TWO OR THREE YEARS OF PRE LITIGATION EXPENSES. TWENTY YEARS OF LEGAL WORK ALRIGHT SO IF I JUST ASSUMED YOUR BILLABLE RATE. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS IT'S A THIRD OF THE SETTLEMENT AT OF AND NOW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LEGAL EXPENSES A YEAR. AT YOUR BILLABLE RATE THAT'S ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND AS YOU KNOW. THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOURS IS ROUGHLY. SAY THREE QUARTERS OF THE TIME OF ONE ATTORNEY. IF YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS SO THE ATTORNEY SAID OF WORKED ON THIS CASE FOR TWENTY YEARS. TEN PUBLIC LAW OFFICES PLUS PRIVATE COUNSEL. OR ABOUT TO BE REIMBURSED HOW MANY ATTORNEY. YOUR LOVE FOR. I I DON'T HAVE THAT FORCE YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT HERE MY POINT HERE IS. THIS TEAM SITTING IN FRONT OF ME THE LOBBYISTS THE CONSULTANTS. ARE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT AND LET'S THROW ALL THE WORDS THAT YOU'VE USED TODAY REDLINING SOME LOWERED SEX OFFENSE REGISTRY INVOKING PRESIDENT OBAMA AND QUOTE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. AND YOU WANT TO SUGGEST. THAT WHAT BEEN ASSOCIATE IN YOUR LAW FIRM. MAKES IT IF YOU PUT ONE FULLTIME ASSOCIATE FOR TWENTY YEARS. A THAT THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT ALL OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING YOUR COMPANY SHARE ONE WILLIAMS AND CONAGRA AND ELLEN NL INDUSTRIES. FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR POISON OUR CHILDREN YOU WANT TO PUT THAT IN CONTENTION IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING HERE RIGHT. SO MY MY POINT WAS WITHOUT DUE RESPECT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT THE COURT HAD DETERMINED. THAT NONE OF THE MONEY FROM THE DECISION COULD GO TO THE TRAILERS THAT WAS NOT MY DECISION. THAT WAS THE COURT'S DECISION I APPRECIATED BUT YOU KEEP EVERYONE IS FOR IT FROM THE FROM FROM YOUR FIRST THE PROPONENTS KEEP PUTTING THE SO CALLED TRIAL ATTORNEYS INTO. THIS ISSUE AND I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST THAT'S NOT FLYING TOO WELL WITH THOSE OF US IN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAW ON HOW MUCH LOWER COSTS. YES AND MY POINT WAS SIMPLY NOT TO DENIGRATE THE TRIAL LAWYERS BUT IT WASN'T THAT INTEGRATE A LOT THE TRAILERS REALLY FEEL THAT THE COURT HAD DETERMINED THAT THEY COULD NOT BE PAID OUT OF THE MONEY AWARDED BY THE COURT. AND SO A SETTLEMENT. THE PRIVATE SETTLEMENT ALLOWED. MONEY TO COME FROM ONE OF THE PARTIES TO GO TO THE PAY THE ATTORNEYS. THAT'S SIMPLY THE POINT. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST TO COLLEAGUES. BECAUSE WE'VE A LOT OF. NO LAWYER COLLEAGUES ON A LEGISLATURE BUT THE WAY THIS WORKS AS YOU KNOW. IS WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION THEY GET TO PAY THE BEST LAWYERS IN THE COUNTRY AND I WOULD INCLUDE MISTER DEISM THAT. YOU PAY YOUR BILL OUR YOU GET PAID FOR EVERY HOUR THAT YOU WORKED ON THIS FOR EVERY HOUR YOU WORK ON THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS. FOR EVERY HOUR THAT. MULTIPLE LAW FIRMS HAVE WORKED ON THIS. DEFENDING THIS CASE AGAINST. PUBLIC LAW FIRM OFFICES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE NOT BEEN PAID FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THE SETTLEMENT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT A. MAYBE IT MAYBE A SENIOR ASSOCIATE WHO'S NOT EVEN A PARTNER AT JONES DAY HAS MADE. AND YOU HAVE PUT OUT OF CONTENTION I JUST WANT TO POINT THIS OUT IT STRIKES ME AS A LITTLE UNFAIR. A PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU HAVE DROPPED THIS FLYER. TO EVERY LEGISLATOR IN THIS BUILDING WITHIN THE LAST TWO HOURS. JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT TO COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU. CHIU AS WE GET READY TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT SEGMENT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT MR MARKSMAN AND MISTER HOW WE ARE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ESPECIALLY. AGAIN YOU REALLY MAKE THE CASE FOR AGAINST THE BALLOT MEASURE AND I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN HANDSOMELY PAID MISTER MARCH WHEN I KNOW THAT. THAT THE. SHERMAN WILLIAMS IS IS A AS A MEMBERS A CORPORATE CONTRIBUTOR TO ORGANIZATION. BUT. PROMOTING A BALLOT MEASURE THAT REMOVES LIABILITY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE PERPETRATED THE HARM. WORKS AGAINST WHAT YOU STAND FOR WE TELL US YOU STAND FOR IN SUPPORT OF YOUR PEOPLE. PUTTING THIS OBLIGATION ON THE TAXPAYERS IN ABSOLVING THE PAIN COMPANIES AGAIN WORKS AGAINST THE PEOPLE YOU SAY OR STAND FOR. AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF THE JUDGMENT HOLE THAT EVEN ABOUT A MILLION. THAT REPRESENT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF. THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EXTRAPOLATING THAT OUT THAT'S TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND LET GET THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS SEEMINGLY MAGNANIMOUSLY IS FOR NOT JUST LEAD PAINT BUT ESPRESSOS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO I I WOULD POSTULATE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF SMOKE AND MIRRORS HERE. THAT THERE IS A LOT OF DISINGENUOUS. SORT OF SUPPORT AND AND AND BACKING FOR A LOT OF OF OF WHAT THIS IS AND IT AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS AGAINST. WELL YOU SAY YOU WHAT YOU SAY YOU STAND FOR IF WE'RE GONNA FIND A SOLUTION AND IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF THERE EVEN IS ONE. AROUND THAT DEFINITION OF NUISANCE MAYBE THE COR GOT IT WRONG THE THE CORE DATA RIGHT I'D I'D THE WAY THAT I READ IT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE AFFECTED THAT YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO IT. WE LASSEN COUNTY FOLKS COME UP AND AND AND TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK YOU TO EARN YOURMONEY HERE TODAY. AND COMING BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY WORKING AGAINST THE THE BALLOT MEASURE AND THEN THE CASE FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE. SO IS IT MY TURN OVER YOU AS WE MOVE TO OUR. NEXT SEGMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO THEN HAVE THE SOME OF THAT REPRESENT IS FROM THE COUNTIES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS. ALL COLUMN UP BY MARKING CORN DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. ROBERT RAGLAND DEPUTY CITY COUNCIL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY ANTENNAE LAMP DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSELS IN THE CLARA COUNTY. AND THEN I'M MR CHU WILL BE DIRECTING TRAFFIC AND. HER THANK YOU. ARCHER COLLEAGUES. SO THIS PANEL. ARE A NUMBER OF OUR PUBLIC INTEREST A LAW OFFICES AROUND THE STATE OF REPRESENTING THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE HAVE TO BE CITY ATTORNEY MARK ANGKOR. ARE REPRESENTING THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL ABOUT ROBERT RAGLAN AND REPRESENTING THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL JENNY LAM. AND I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A REPRESENTING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. A DOCTOR CYRUS RANKIN OF THE DIRECTOR OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT. WANT WE START WITH THE PUBLIC INTEREST ATTORNEYS WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO START OUT WENT OVER THE GOOD DOCTOR. OKAY DOCTOR PLACE. MY NAME IS SAID CYRUS RANKIN AND I ME. BOARD CERTIFIED PEDIATRICIAN AND MEDICAL TOXICOLOGIST FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. SPECIALISING IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF HUMAN POISONINGS. I INCLUDING LEAD. AYE AM DIRECTOR THE TOXICOLOGY AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT BRANCH OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND I'M ALSO ONE OF THE SYSTEM MEDICAL DIRECTORS OF CALIFORNIA POISON CONTROL SYSTEM. AND I'M ALSO MEDICAL TOXICOLOGY CONSULTING PHYSICIAN FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES. I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO OFFER MY PERSPECTIVES ON THE BURDEN OF LEAD POISONING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THE. THE ROLE OF LEATHER A LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT. LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN KNOWN. AS AN ENTITY FOR SINCE ANCIENT TIMES AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS SOURCES OF LEAD IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS LEAD POISONING REMAINS THE MOST IMPORTANT. PEDIATRIC ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM TODAY. I WAS. SIMILARLY PUZZLED BY THE USE OF THE QUOTE BY PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WAS. LED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE. TO. TREAT LEAD POISONING AND. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THE BEATLES OR PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD THAT IN MIND BUT I THOUGHT THIS TROUBLE ACTUALLY DID BRING UP A VERY INTERESTING POINT WHICH WAS THAT. WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNEW BEFORE AND LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE DO KNOW TODAY? DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN AVERAGE BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OVER THE YEARS PEDIATRICIANS RIGHTFULLY HAVE A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT EMERGING RESEARCH. SHOWING MEASURABLE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF EVEN VERY LOW BLOOD LEAD LEVELS WHICH WE DID KNOW ABOUT BEFORE. THAT PARTICULARLY ON THE DEVELOPING BRAINS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. AND THESE INFECTS UP THESE EFFECTS INCLUDE I THINK YOU BROUGHT THIS UP MISTER CHIU IMPAIRED INTELLIGENCE OUT LEARNING DISABILITIES. BEHAVIOR ABNORMALITIES AMONG MANY OTHERS. PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT PREVENTION. BUT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ARE POORLY EQUIPPED. A FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON PRIMARY PREVENTION WHEN IT COMES TO LEAD POISONING. INSTEAD WE HAVE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY LESS ABOUT PREVENTION AND INSTEAD ARE GEARED TOWARDS SECONDARY DISEASE SCREENING. SECONDARY DISEASE SCREENING INVOLVES A PEDIATRICIAN TESTING THE BLOOD OF CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO. TO LOOK FOR ELEVATED LEVELS OF LEAD IN THE BLOOD. WHEN AN ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS FOUND OUR DEPARTMENT DISPATCHES A TEAM. OF INSPECTORS IN PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES TO THE HOME. AND THE INSPECTORS SEEK TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAD POISONING. THE NURSE EVALUATES THE CLINICAL STATUS OF THE CHILD TO IDENTIFY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY BE AT RISK SUCH AS OTHER CHILDREN AND FEMALES OF CHILDBEARING AGE AND FACILITATE SECONDARY DISEASE SCREENING HER THOSE PEOPLE AS APPROPRIATE. THUS YOU CAN SEE THAT. WE WAIT. WE WAIT FOR A CHILD TO BECOME LEAD POISONED FIRST. AND THEN WE TAKE ACTION. AND THIS IS A PROCESS OF CATCH UP NOT PREVENTION. THESE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN POISONED AND THE DAMAGE FROM LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN DONE OR IS BEING DONE AS THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. TREATING LEAD POISONING AFTER THE FACT IS A FAIRLY DIFFICULT TASK AND THE FIRST PART OF TREATMENT INVOLVES REMOVING THE CHILD FROM THE SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING TO AVOID FURTHER INJURY. BUT EVEN THAT HAS ITS PROBLEMS AS SOMETIMES A CHILD MAY BE REMOVED FROM THAT HOME. PLACED IN THE HOME OF ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER AND THAT FAMILY MEMBER HAS A HOUSE THAT HAS LEAD PAINT AS WELL. SO THE INJURY MAY CONTINUE. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THERE IS LITTLE THAT CAN BE DONE FOR INJURY THAT MAY HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. SO PEDIATRICIANS ARE HANDCUFFED SOMEWHAT BY THIS SECONDARY SCREENING DYNAMIC INTO SIMPLY MANAGING THE POTENTIAL LIFELONG. HEALTH EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING ON CHILD LEARNING CHILD BEHAVIOR AND NUMEROUS OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS. SO PORTS PREVENTION IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE. AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO TREAT LEAD POISONING THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO TREAT IT. IS TO PREVENT IT FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THIS IS WHERE IT LEAD ABATEMENT. LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT COMES IN. LEAD PAINT IS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE OF OF LEAD POISONING IN U. S. CHILDREN TODAY. WHEN I TEACH MY STUDENTS AND MY MEDICAL RESIDENTS ABOUT LEAD POISONING I INFORMED THEM THAT. LED PAIN IS THE NUMBER ONE MOST COMMON REASON FOR LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN. I ALSO TELL THEM THAT THE SECOND MOST COMMON REASON. IS LEAD PAINT AND THE THIRD MOST COMMON REASON. IS LEAD PAINT AND THE FOURTH FIFTH SIXTH SEVENTH EIGHTH NINTH AND TENTH MOST COMMON REASONS. CHILDREN BE POISONED BY LEAD. OUR LEAD PAINT AND AFTER THAT ALL THE OTHER KNOWN SOURCES OF LEAD DO CONTRIBUTE BUT YOU GET THE IDEA THAT LEAD PAINT IS. THE ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM AND FOR THAT MATTER IN EVERY OTHER ROOM WHERE LEAD PAINT MAY BE ON THE WALL. SO. I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT THE NATURAL BEHAVIOR OF YOUNG CHILDREN. COUPLED WITH THE NATURAL DETERIORATION OF LEAD PAINT IS WHAT CREATES THIS SORT OF PERFECT STORM. BY WHICH CHILDREN ENCOUNTER CHIPS AND AND FLECKS OF LEAD PAINT EAT THEM AND ABSORB THEM INTO THE BODY. AND CHILDREN ARE ALSO AT RISK IN THE HOME FROM A MORE. HIDDEN PATHWAY OF LEAD PAINT EXPOSURE AND THAT'S IN THE FORM OF LEAD PAINT DUST WHICH IS RELATIVELY INVISIBLE TO THE MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD. AND THAT IS LIBERATED FROM THE OPENING IN AND CLOSING OF DOORS AND THE AND WINDOWS. PREVENTION OF CHILDHOOD. LEAD EXPOSURE OR PROP CHILDHOOD EXPOSURE TO LEAD PAINT. CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY CHANGING THE PHYSIOLOGY AND THE BEHAVIOR OF A ONE YEAR OLD CHILD. PREVENTION CAN ONLY OCCUR BY ELIMINATING THE SOURCE AND LED PAINT ABATEMENT OF COURSE IS THE WAY TO DO THAT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE ABILITY OF THE LOS CAN'T LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ABATE THE PROBLEM OF LEAD PAINT. GENERALLY COMES IN THE FORM OF OCCASIONAL SMALL GRANTS THAT WE GET TO MITIGATE A VERY VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF HOMES AT ANY GIVEN TIME. AND UNFORTUNATELY LOS ANGELES STILL HAS ONE OF THE OLDEST HOUSING STOCKS IN THE COUNTRY AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF HOMES IS STILL CONTAIN LEAD PAINT. UNTIL WE HAVE CONTROL. OVER THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING. WE MUST CONTINUE THIS. WHAT I THINK IS UNFORTUNATE PRACTICE OF RELYING ON SECONDARY DISEASE SCREENING OF THE BLOOD OF YOUNG CHILDREN TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT LEAD POISONING AFTER HIS ALREADY OCCURRED? SO WE SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR DISEASE TO OCCUR BEFORE TREATING IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO. AND THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS TO PREVENT DISEASE AN ABATEMENT OF LEAD PAINT IS THE KEY TO DOING THAT. ALL THAT BEING SAID. THIS PROPOSED INITIATIVE AS INDICATED BY THE TITLE ITSELF THAT ELIMINATES. LEAD PAINT COMPANIES RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE A HEALTH PROBLEM. THAT THEY CREATE. AND I I'M NO LAWYER BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WE DIDN'T BURDEN TAXPAYERS WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO ADDRESS ALL OF THE LUNG CANCERS THAT WERE CAUSED BY THE TOBACCO COMPANIES. AND I I DON'T FIND THIS SITUATION THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. AND AS I UNDERSTAND OF THE JUDGE TOLD LETTING COMPANIES TO CLEAN UP THEIR MESS. AND THIS PROPOSED INITIATIVE. LOOKS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING BECAUSE ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE A GREAT IDEA TO CLEAN UP LEAD PAINT FROM HOMES BUT. IT'S NOT MADE CLEAR THAT THIS INITIATIVE IS AN ATTEMPT BY THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES TO GET THEMSELVES OFF THE HOOK FOR A MESS THAT THE COURT'S ORDER THEM TO FIX. AND IT MAKES SENSE TO ME FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. TO HOLD THE LEAD PAINT COMPANY SET UP. ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT COURT DECISION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANTED TO INVITE UP A TO. SET THE DYESS. IF THEY ARE HERE WE HAD TWO OTHER WITNESSES WERE PART OF THIS PANEL DOCTOR BELA. MATT YES AS WELL AS SON JAY WEIGEL. IF YOU LIKE TO COME UP THE ONE WE PROCEED TO WORK TO THE NEXT WITNESS. AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. MR RECKLESS. MY NAME IS. ROBERT RAGLAND. I AM A. PRINCIPAL DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL FOR THE OFFICE OF COUNTY COUNCIL. IN LOS ANGELES. AND I'M ONE OF THE MANY PUBLIC COUNSEL THAT REPRESENTED THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE VERSES. CONAGRA LA LA LAND MARK THAT BRIEFCASE. YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE LITIGATION AND THE LENGTH AND THE. INTENSITY AND THE DURATION OF IT ALL. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. HOW? THE AFFIRMATIVE THAT PUBLIC NUISANCE DECISION AGAINST THREE DEFENDANTS WAS. BASED ON THEIR AFFIRMATIVE PROMOTION OF. USING LEAD PAINT AND THE INTERIORS OF HOMES WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEALTH HAZARDS. THAT USING THAT PAINT WOULD CREATE. IN ANOTHER WAY IT'S. THE TRIAL COURT FOUND ON THE APPELLATE COURT. A FIRM. THAT EACH COMPANY HAD ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE. FOR YEARS AND YEARS. OF THE HAZARDS THAT THEIR PRODUCT WAS GOING TO CALL BECAUSE INCLUDING. CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING GET ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE MARKET SELL. AND PROMOTE LED PAPER. THAT USE. THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WAS FILED. WITH THE STATE. EIGHT. EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE APPELLATE RULING. IT WAS CLEARLY. A TACTIC THAT. ALTHOUGH. I WAS DISAPPOINTED AND I'M REALLY NOT SURPRISED FROM FROM THE DEPEND DEFENDANT'S BEHAVIOR DURING THE CASE. WE ARE NOW BACK BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO DETERMINE. UP WHAT THE ABATEMENT FUND WILL BE FOR PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HOMES. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE AT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE DEFENDANTS BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN. SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OUR DAY IN COURT. WITH REGARD TO. HOW WE WOULD USE THE ABATEMENT FIND AS? AS A COUNTY. OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTENDS TO EMPLOY. DEBATE AFFRONT TO AGGRESSIVELY. OBAID LEAD PAINT HAZARDS FROM HOMES WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE WANT TO USE THIS FUNDING TO PROMOTE HEALTH EQUALITY IN THAT IT IS ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE. EXPECTED HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY COME FROM IMPOVERISHED AND LEAD BURDEN COMMUNITIES. THIS MEANS THAT LA COUNTY IS FULLY COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THEIR BATEMAN PLAN CREATED BY JUDGE KLEINBERG. LA COUNTY WILL CREATE A ROBUST. PUBLIC OUTREACH AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IN ORDER TO TARGET AND ROLL AND PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR HOMES TESTED FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS. I'M WE WANT OWN ROLE THOSE FAMILIES AND I WAS GOING TO USE THE EXACT SAME QUOTE. THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK ROAD NETWORK SAID ON PAGE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR. BECAUSE. IT IS NOT A RISK TO HOMEOWNERS TO ENROLL IN OUR PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY NEED THE LIABILITY PROTECTION IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS COURT ORDER PROGRAM WHICH WE ARE FULLY READY TO IMPLEMENT. ONCE WE. HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE. A LA COUNTY WILL PROVIDE ABATEMENT REMEDIATION AND COMPONENT REPLACEMENT SERVICES AS APPROPRIATE TO THOSE RESIDENTS THAT MEANS. FRICTION SURFACES WHERE LEAD PAINT AND SHIPS. CAN FALL ONTO THE FLOOR BECOME DUST AND BE INGESTED BY CHILDREN. WINDOW SILLS OUTDOORS. THRESHOLDS. AND PROVIDE OUR REGION EDUCATION AND INTERVENTION SERVICES TO THOSE RESIDENTS OF VOLUNTEER TO BE PART OF THE COUNTIES PROGRAM. A PUBLIC COUNSEL ATTORNEYS FROM THE TEN JURISDICTIONS WORKED VERY HARD WITH THEIR PRIVATE COUNSEL COLLEAGUES. TO BRING ABOUT THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THE WELL BEING. OF THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR JURISDICTION IT IS A WAY TO ELIMINATE EXPOSURE TO CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD TO CHILDREN PRIOR TO THEIR INGESTION OF LEAD. AND TO IMPROVE IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY THE HEALTH. TRAJECTORY OF GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN. A CURRENT PICTURE OF LEAD ABATEMENT. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS NOT. AS OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A PERMANENT LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAM LA. ELLIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADDRESSES CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS DOCTOR RAINES SAID. IN. AND. CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING AND LEAD POISONING PREVENTION TO IT'S CLIP PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED ENTIRELY BY THE STATE. CLICK FUNDING CANNOT BE USED FOR ABATEMENT. AND THAT USE IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY OUR GRANT AGREEMENT. I COUNTY RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A% YEAR FOR CLIP FOR OUTREACH. BOTH FOR MEDICAL OUTREACH AND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL OUTREACH THIS FINDING IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE OUR REGION ENVIRONMENTAL. INTERVENTION SERVICES TO FAMILIES. WITH CHILDREN WHOSE ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL IS LOWER THAN THE CASE DEFINITION OF NINE POINT FIVE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER. THAT REMEMBER THAT THE CDC HAS OPINED THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL LEAD IN CHILD'S BLOOD BUT THERE IS. INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THE COUNTY DID AND TO INTERVENE FOR FAMILIES OF CHILDREN. WHO TEST AS HIGH AS NINE MICROGRAMS REBEKAH LEADER WHICH IS HI? THAT'S A HIGH LEVEL. AS A RESULT MANY CHILDREN IN LA COUNTY AND THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS CONTINUE TO SUFFER SERIOUS HARM. FROM LEAD PAINT. HISTORICALLY OUR COUNTIES RESIDENTIAL LEAD ABATEMENT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PIECEMEAL AS THEY'RE DRIVEN BY GRANT FUNDING FROM HUD. WE MUST COMPETE FOR THOSE GRANT FUNDS WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS THESE GRANTS ARE BOTH SPORADIC IN VERY LIMITED. AS USING THIS FUNDING THE COUNTY IS ONLY ABLE TO PROVIDE LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT TO LESS THAN. TWO HUNDRED HOMES PER GRANT. THIS IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO PREVENT EXPOSURE OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN TO LEAD PAINT HAZARDS. REMEMBER THAT THE CLIP PROGRAM IS REALLY A MISNOMER IT IS REALLY AN INTERVENTION AFTER THE CHILD HAS ALREADY BEEN POISONED PROGRAM. AS DOCTOR RANKIN TESTIFIED ONCE A CHILD IS BEEN POISONED BY LEAD PAINT THE NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE THAT CHILD HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND PEDIATRICIANS ARE LEFT TO MANAGE THAT INJURY. THE COUNTIES CLIP PROGRAMS CONCENTRATE ON BRINGING THAT CHILD'S LEAD LEVEL DOWN AND PREVENT. OR LIMIT FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER EXPOSURE SHOULD THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE. APPROPRIATELY TITLED ELIMINATE CERTAIN LIABILITY FROM LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. LA COUNTY'S ABATEMENT PROGRAM WILL REMAIN AS IT IS TODAY PIECEMEAL IT WILL AGAIN BE GRANT DRIVEN AND NOT BE AS COMPREHENSIVE AS LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT REQUIRED BY THE COURT. THIS TIME HOWEVER THE FUNDING INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING ON THE NUMBER ONE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD. TO CHILDREN WILL ALSO. BE AVAILABLE FOR MANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANDARD HOUSING WHILE OUTWARDLY THIS MIGHT BE A LOT OF LOCAL THE TRUE FACT IS. TO DILUTE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY. FOR COMPREHENSIVE AND MEANINGFUL ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION FOR THE LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT FOR CHILDREN IN THIS CENTURY. REMEMBER THAT LEAD POISONING HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO COST SOCIETY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT ON PREVENTING LEAD X.. CPOS ARE THERE IS A SAVINGS TO SOCIETY. BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS. AGAIN OUR CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS CANARIES IN A COAL MINE WAITING FOR THE ELEVATOR BLOOD LEAD LEVELS TO SHOW US WHERE. LEAD PAINT HAZARDS EXISTS. LA COUNTY WILL USE A TO BAIT AND FUND DOLLARS TO TAKE ACTION TO IMPROVE THE LIVING ENVIRONMENT OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN INTERVENING. SO THEY DO NOT BECOME LIKE POISON HAVING TO DEAL WITH FUTURE LEARNING DISABILITIES OF BEHAVIOR. ISSUES AND CLOSING THE COUNTY'S BEST OPTION IS TO MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE AND AND MEANINGFUL IMPACT. ON PREVENTING FURTHER CASES OF CHILDREN BEING POISONED BY LEAD PAINT HAZARDS. AND. TO SECURE THE COURT ORDERED ABATEMENT FIND AND IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED A PAYMENT PLAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU WANT TO GO TO THIS RECORD. BOB SO MONEY WAS MORE DECOR NINE THE DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR CITY ATTORNEY MORE ELLIOTT I'M THE LEAD ATTORNEY FOR OFFICE IN THE LEAD PAINT LAWSUIT. IS THE OPINION OF THE CITY ATTORNEY OF SAN DIEGO THAT THE INITIATIVE IS A THREAT TO THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. IT DEPRIVES A MAJORITY OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR BEATING THE HAZARDS OF LEAD BASED PAINT. IT PROMISES NO FUNDING. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE SEE SERIOUS DANGER TO OUR CHILDREN. A DANGER THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS WAS KNOWINGLY PERPETRATED BY. THE INITIATIVE SPONSORS. AND A DANGER THAT THE COURTS HAVE SAID THEY MUST NOW HELP CORRECT. I'M NUMBER PREPARED REMARKS I'M GONNA SHORTEN THOUGH SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER A LOT OF THE DETAILS THE EVERYONE IS UP TO SPEED. I WOULD LIKE TO TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DIDN'T DIDN'T SAY. ARE. IT IT IT WOULD THE COURT OF APPEALS LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN A SIX WEEK BENCH TRIAL. ARE IT INCLUDING HISTORICAL MATERIALS WHICH SHOWED THAT THE PAINT INDUSTRY GENERALLY AND THE THREE DEFENDANTS SPECIFICALLY. NEW IS EARLY IS THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES THAT LEAD PAINT IS TOXIC AND A POISON. FOR ONE EXAMPLE SHERMAN WILLIAMS OWN INTERNAL PUBLICATION. IT'S CALLED THE CHAMELEON. OF THE PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED. THAT STATED AND HERE I QUOTE. THE FAMILIAR CHARACTERISTIC OF WHITE LED. IS ITS TENDENCY TO CRUMBLE FROM THE SURFACE POPULARLY KNOWN AS CHALKING. IT IS ALSO FAMILIARLY KNOWN THAT WHITE LED IS A DEADLY CUMULATIVE POISON. THIS NOXIOUS QUALITY BECOME SERIOUS IN A PAINT THE DISINTEGRATES AND IS BLOWN ABOUT BY THE WIND. NEVERTHELESS TEN YEARS AFTER WRITING OUT IN ITS OWN PUBLICATION. SURE WHEN WILLIAMS BOUGHT A LEAD MINE. WHICH IT USED TO MANUFACTURE LEAD CARBONATE PIGMENT FROM NINETEEN TEN TO NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN FOR USE IN ITS OWN PAINTS. SHERMAN WILLIAMS CONTINUE TO MAKE LEAD PAINT UNTIL NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. AND CONTINUE TO SELL LEAD PAINT UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. SIMILAR EVIDENCE HOW ABOUT THE COURT OF APPEAL SHOWED THAT EN EL AND CON AGRA. ALSO PROMOTED LEAD PAINT FOR DECADES. EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS TOXIC AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS A POISON. NO WHERE IN THE DECISION BY THE COURT OF APPEAL. DID THE COURT OF APPEAL THE TRIAL COURT IT'S A RITUAL TO GO DUH JUDGMENT. DECLARE ANY SPECIFIC PROPERTY OR CATEGORY OF PROPERTIES TO BE A PUBLIC NUISANCE. AND THE REASON IS SIMPLE THE LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SECTION THREE FOUR EIGHT ZERO OF THE CIVIL CODE SAYS AND I QUOTE. A PUBLIC NUISANCE IS SOMETHING INJURIES TO HEALTH THAT HERE'S THE QUOTE AFFECTS AT THE SAME TIME AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OR NEIGHBORHOOD. PAIN IN A SPECIFIC HOUSE OR IN A SPECIFIC LOCATION OR ON A SPECIFIC PROPERTY DOES NOT AFFECT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY AT THE SAME TIME AND IN THE SAME WAY. BUT THE DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS IN PROMOTING TOXIC AND POISONOUS PAIN. VERY CLEARLY DOES. AND I THINK THEY KNOW THIS. THE AUTHORS OF THE INITIATIVE THEMSELVES KNOW THIS THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE'VE TALKED AROUND ABOUT THIS FOR A COUPLE HOURS. BUT WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED UP THE WORDS OF THE INITIATIVE ITSELF. AND HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PREPARE THIS IN HAND THIS OUT. PAGE THREE OF THEIR OWN STATEMENT OKAY PAGE THREE A ASKS THE OF THE INITIATIVE I'M ADDS THIS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. SECTION FIVE THREE NINE ONE ZERO SUBSECTION A LET ME QUOTE TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW. LEAD BASED PAINT ON OR IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. WHETHER CONSIDERED INDIVIDUALLY. COLLECTIVELY OR IN THE AGGREGATE IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE. FIRST OF ALL IT'S THE ONLY TIME THE WORD LEAD BASED PAINT OCCURS IN THE ENTIRE INITIATIVE. SECOND OF ALL. IF THEY WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT READ TAKING INDIVIDUAL HOUSES AND THAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS INITIATIVE. WHY DID THEY ADD THE WORDS COLLECTIVELY OR IN THE AGGREGATE? THAT'S REALLY THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE GETTING. COLLECTIVELY AND IN THE AGGREGATE BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE LIABILITY BOTH OF THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEAL. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RECOGNIZING LEAD IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IN TWO THOUSAND CHU THIS BODY ADDED SEVENTEEN NINE TWENTY POINT TEN TO THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. THAT STATUTE DEFINES A LEAD HAZARD AND ESTABLISHES THAT ANY PROPERTY THAT HAS A LEAD HAZARD ON IT IS IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. NAY FOR LOT FROM ATTORNEYS WHO TALK IN GENERAL TERMS ABOUT HOUSING POLICY. BUT NONE OF THEM DO CODE ENFORCEMENT WHERE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT THAT MONITOR ON A DAILY BASIS WHAT ARE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES DO RUNNING AROUND HOMES. AND FORCING OWNERS TO CLEAN THEM UP. IT IS A VERY CRUCIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN LEAD IN A HOUSE THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT. THAT'LL LEAD HAUSER ONLY A LEAD HAZARD IS ACTUALLY ACTIONABLE. AND IT REQUIRES TWO DIFFERENT THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE LEAD PAINT HAS TO BE DETERIORATED. THAT MEANS IT'S PEELING IT'S CHIPPING IT'S CRACKING IT SEPARATED FROM THE SURFACE. SECOND THE DETERIORATED CONDITION MUST BE MORE THAN MINIMAL IT HAS TO BE TO SQUARE FEET IN AN INTERIOR SPACE. OR TEN SQUARE FEET AND AN EXTERIOR SPACE. WE HAVE IT JUST THE OF VERY NICE EXAMPLE. OF THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF LEAD AND A LEAD HAZARD. THE BUILDING WERE SITTING IN RIGHT NOW. EAST CAPITAL ANNEX. DESTRUCTIVE BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY NINE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. LEAD BASED PAINT WAS USED ON MANY MAYBE EVEN ALL OF THE INTERIOR SURFACES BECAUSE THAT WAS THE STANDARD TIME. NOW DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IN ITS REPORT FROM JANUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN HAD THIS TO SAY ABOUT THE BUILDING. THE CITY IT IS AGED OUTDATED INEFFICIENT AND DETERIORATED OF THOSE OF THOSE WORDS IS NOT MY WORDS AS THE WORDS OF THE. THE THE DDS. THE REPORT NOTED THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCLUDING P. C. B.'S. IT'S BEST THIS AND YES LEAD BASED PAINT BUT THE CAPITAL ANNEX HAS NOT BEEN RED TAGGED. NOT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL NOT FOR ANYBODY ELSE. AND REST ASSURED THE STATE LEGISLATURE IS NOT OPERATING A PUBLIC HAZARD AND YOU'RE NOT OPERATING A PUBLIC NUISANCE. ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IS JUST IT'S JUST FLAT WRONG. ONLY IN LEAD HAZARD ACTUALLY DIMINISHES THE VALUE OF THE HOUSE AND CAN ONLY A LEAD HAZARD CONSERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A CODE VIOLATION. NOTHING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION CHANGES THAT. THAT WAS THE EXISTING LAW THAT IS THE EXISTING LAW NOTHING IN THE INITIATIVE CHANGES THAT. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE LEAD PAINT CREEK HEALTH CRISIS AS WELL IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE CITY PASSED ONE OF THE STRONGEST LOCAL ORDINANCES IN THE COUNTRY. TO EMPOWER ITS CORDON CODE ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS TO IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE LEAD HAZARDS. AND I'M I'M SORRY THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN IS NOT HERE HE WAS ON THE SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL AT THE TIME HE WAS ONE OF THE VOTES THAT THAT HELPED PASS THAT IN IMPORTANT ORDINANCE. AND I THINK YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE CREDIT FOR WHAT HE DID. THE SENATE PRO TEM OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS OF THE CITY COUNCIL SAN DIEGO. AT THAT TIME AND SHE ALSO HELP PASS THAT WORD. THE ORDINANCE HAS BEEN A MODEL FOR JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO. BOTH DIRECTLY AND BY TRAINING OTHERS TO BE CERTIFIED. CREATE A WORK FORCE THAT CAN HANDLE THESE ABATEMENT ISSUES. BUT THE FINAL WE JUST ADDRESS ONE WORD ABOUT THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS. UP THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS WERE HIRED I CAN SPEAK SPECIFICALLY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THEM I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. ONCE AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN AND ASSEMBLING A WOMAN OF THE SARIS SENATOR SENATE PRO TEM LEADER OF THE. TWENTY ATKINS WERE BOTH ON THE CITY COUNCIL THE TIME AND THEY DROVE A HARD BARGAIN. I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF THEM COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A PUSHOVER. IT BY NO MEANS THAT THEY AUTHORIZE A THIRTY THREE PERCENT CONTINGENCY FEE OUR CONTINGENCY FEE IS LESS THAN HALF THAT AT SEVENTEEN PERCENT SERBIAN LOOKED SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF THAT. SEVENTEEN PERCENT. SO MOST OF THE THE ACTUAL FACTS IN THIS IN THIS FLYER THAT WAS PUT AROUND FLAT WRONG. IT'S NOT THIRTY THREE PERCENT NONE OF THE JUDGE NONE OF THE JURISDICTION SIGNED ANYTHING RMOTELY LIKE THAT. AND FRANKLY MISTER DEEDS OUGHT TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE HE WAS THE FIRM THAT TOOK IT UP ON THE BOAT UP TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN TWENTY TEN. CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THOSE CONTINGENCY FEE CONTRACTS THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE RATES ARE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE ALL THOSE THE AGREEMENTS. NOT NOT BEEN IS NOT SECRET NOR ALL MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD. AND THAT'S NOT THE RATE. FINALLY JUST LET ME CONCLUDE. NOTHING IN THE INITIATIVE PROMISES ANY FUNDING WHATSOEVER FOR LEAD BASED PAINT PARA BAITING LEAD HAZARDS. NOTHING IN THE INITIATIVE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LED PAIN IS A DANGER TO CHILDREN'S HEALTH. YEAH GIVES A PASTOR CON AGRA AND SHARON WILLIAMS FROM THEIR HEART ESTABLISH LIABILITY AT A COST TO TAXPAYERS OF NEARLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. THEY SHOULD CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESS. WHEN WE MOVED TO MUSLIM. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS TOTALLY EMINEM A DEPUTY COUNTY COUNSEL FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS I'VE. BEEN WORKING ON THE LITIGATION THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON. AND MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT OUR CASE GENERALLY AND OUR JUDGMENT SPECIFICALLY SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID AMOUNTS TO FLAT OUT MISREPRESENTATIONS BUT MUCH OF WHAT IS THAT SAID QUITE FRANKLY AMOUNTS TO SCARE TACTICS INTENDED TO CONFUSE AND TURNED LEGISLATORS. AND THE PUBLIC AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS IN OTHER WELL ATTENTION FOLKS AGAINST CERTAIN BLOOD RELATED BILLS PENDING BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE. NO SHERMAN WILLIAMS COMPANY IN FACT HAS SPONSORED A GROUP CALLED CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS GROUP HAS NOT ONLY CREATED A WEBSITE THAT SPREADS MISTER IN MISINFORMATION ABOUT OUR CASE BUT IT IS RUNNING FACEBOOK ADS. THAT'S ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN FEAR MONGERING IT THOSE ADS ARE TELLING PEOPLE THAT GOVERNMENT INSPECTORS ARE COMING FOR THEM THAT THEY MAY BE CHARGED WITH THE CRIME FOR OWNING A PRE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE HOME. THAT THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN LABELED PUBLIC NUISANCES AND THAT THIS CAN DROP THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SELL THEIR HOMES. THESE STATEMENTS ARE COMPLETELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT I'M SURE YOU AND I'D LIKE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT OUR CASE OUR JUDGMENT AND THE EFFECT OF THE INITIATIVE ON OUR CASE IN FUTURE CASES. SO MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID AND GROUND HAS BEEN WELL COVERED BY MY CO COUNSEL FROM SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT OUR CASE. SO I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN POINTED OUT. OUR CASE WAS BROUGHT BY AND HOW HAS ALWAYS BEEN LED BY THE COUNTY COUNCILS IN CITY IT TURNS FOR THE TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES INVOLVED IN OUR LAWSUIT. WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OUR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THE SO CALLED CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS CHARACTERIZED OUR LAWSUIT AS ONE PUSHED BY OUT OF STATE TRIAL ATTORNEYS MOTIVATED BY PROFIT AS YOU HEARD FROM MY. COLLEAGUE MARK AND CORN THIRTY THREE PERCENT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING ANYWHERE ACT. TRAIL COUNSELOR NOT RECEIVING ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THIRTY THREE PERCENT. AND. THE FACT THAT OUR. LAWSUIT HAS BEEN PUSHED BY SO CALLED TRIAL ATTORNEYS. MOTIVATED BY PROFIT IS ALSO A FIGMENT OF THE IMAGINATION. ACTUALLY DEFENDANT'S CHALLENGE TO OUR USE OF A CONTINGENCY FEE COUNSEL EARLY ON IN THE CASE AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HELD THAT OUR USE OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL WAS ENTIRELY PROPERLY. PROPER. CONSISTENT WITH THE COURT'S DECISION TO COUNTY COUNCILS INSIDIOUS REMAINS HAVE LED THE CASE FROM DAY ONE AND RETAIN COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THE COURSE AND CONDUCT OF THE CASE. I CAN ATTEST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO ALL OF THE LATE NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS SPENT WORKING ON THIS CASE. DECISIONS REGARDING SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE PUBLIC ATTORNEYS WORKING ON THE CASE AND THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ALWAYS COME FIRST. NOW THAT THE CASE HAS RETURNED TO THE TRIAL COURT'S ES CALCULATE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF THE ABATEMENT FIND. DEFENDANTS BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION HAVE SAID THAT THERE LIABILITIES AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED NINE MILLION DOLLARS WE PUT THAT FIGURE AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE ELIMINATED IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES. OUR LAWSUIT SETS FORTH THE BLUEPRINT BY WHICH CITY ATTORNEYS COUNTY COUNCILS OTHER PUBLIC PROSECUTORS FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS STATE CAN FILE SIMILAR PUBLIC NUISANCE LAWSUITS AND OBTAIN SIMILAR FUNDS FOR THE ABATEMENT OF LEAD PAINT IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. BUT THE AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN OBTAIN THROUGH SUCH LAWSUITS GOES EVEN BEYOND THE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE OBTAINED. THAT'S BECAUSE THAT ARE LAWSUIT WAS ONLY ABLE TO HOLD DEFENDANTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR LEAD PAINT IN PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HOMES AND FOR ONLY BE INTERIOR PLANES. THERE IS OTHER LAWSUITS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS COULD CERTAINLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE DEFENDANTS ARE LIABLE FOR ALL HOUSING BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND FOR INTERIOR AS WELL AS EXTERIOR PAINT. SO. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UP TO IT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL ABATEMENT FUNDS ESSENTIALLY BECOMES ELIMINATED IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES AND WHEN THE. COST OF THIS INITIATIVE ARE TALLIED UP AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR BUT NOT JUST THE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR CASE. THAT THE UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS CAN ALSO. OBTAIN ON THE RIM. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR CASE. WHEN WE JUST. CONTINUE ON FOR THE FINAL PRESENTATIONS OF LIKE TO TURN OVER TO THE GOOD DOCTOR DR MADNESS. AND THANK YOU KAREN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M I'M DOCTOR BILL MUCH ACTION CURRENTLY THE HEALTH OFFICER. NEWTON SEES ME AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SOLANO COUNTY. AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DOING THE CHILDHOOD LEAD ISSUES FOR THE FULL THIRTY YEARS OF MY CAREER AS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL. TESTIFIED IN A SIMILAR TRIAL IN RHODE ISLAND TESTIFIED AT THIS TRIAL SERVED ON THE CDC'S CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING PREVENTION ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO I CAN SPEAK. I THINK WROTE WITH RELATIVE. CERTAINTY ABOUT ABOUT THE HARMS THAT LED CAUSES TO THE CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND AND I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT A FAIR BIT YOU ALL APPEAR TO BE ACTUALLY QUITE WELL VERSED ON THESE ISSUES ARE SIMPLY REITERATE THE FACTS. THAT. CHILDREN WERE POISONED EVEN AT VERY LOW LEVELS OF LEAD SUSTAIN MEANINGFUL SIGNIFICANT NEUROLOGIC IMPACTS THAT ARE PERMANENT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LEAD THE HARM THAT'S CAUSED CANNOT BE TREATED. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF EXPOSURE OF LEAD TO TO FOR CHILDREN TO LEAD IS PAIN THAT'S BEEN NOTED MULTIPLE TIMES. AND THE CHILDREN BECOME EXPOSED BY BEING NOTHING MORE THAN CHILDREN AS TO THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES OF CHILDHOOD THAT THEY BECOME EXPOSED TO LEAD IN THE HOME. IN IN MY COUNTY INSULIN ACCOUNT WE HAVE A POPULATION OF ONLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE SO WERE APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENT OF THE STATE BUT IN THAT COUNTY. WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY AND WE HAVE SIXTY FIVE pSEVENTY EIGHT ALL OF WHICH MAY CONTAIN LEAD AND EXPOSE OUR CHILDREN. THE PROOF OF THE FACT THAT THIS CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM IS THAT WE FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS HAVE HAD. EIGHTY FIVE CHILDREN ON AVERAGE REPORTED TO US WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS NOW ONLY ABOUT A THIRD TO A SIXTH OF THE CHILDREN ARE TESTED. AND SO YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN CLEARLY MULTIPLY THAT VALUE BY THREE TO SIX TO GET A TRUER VALUE OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING POISONED TODAY. IN SOLANO COUNTY AND YOU CAN CLEARLY EXTRAPOLATE THAT TO THE STATE. AS AS AS HAD BEEN NOTED EARLIER IN CALIFORNIA TENSOF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE POISONED BY LEAD EVERY YEAR EVEN TODAY THE PROBLEM REMAINS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE INVADED FOR THE PROBLEM TO GO AWAY. THE IMPACT OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY POOR. THE RISKS FOR LEAD POISONING OUR GREATEST IN OLD IN OLDER LESS WELL MAINTAINED COMMUNITIES OFTEN IN MULTI UNIT RENTAL DWELLINGS. WHEN WE LEARNED OF A CHILD WITH AN ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVEL OUR PRIMARY GOAL IS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS IS TO PREVENT FURTHER EXPOSURE TO LET. AND WE DO THAT BECAUSE AGAIN THERE IS NO TREATMENT FOR THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN CAUSED FOR THAT CHILD. SO WE WORK WITH FAMILIES OF THE LEAD POLLUTION CHILD. TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OR THE SOURCES OF EXPOSURE AND TO ELIMINATE OR AT LEAST CONTROL THOSE. AND FOR CHILDREN WHO HAVE SUSTAIN NEUROLOGIC DAMAGE THE ONLY RECOURSE IS ADAPTIVE THERAPY THEY REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION ASSISTANCE AND OTHER TYPES OF THERAPEUTIC ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE THEY NOW HAVE TO ADAPT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE LESS CAPABLE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE. SO GIVEN THAT THE DAMAGE TERM BECAUSE THE CHILDREN'S RINGS IS PERMANENT AND THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE THE ONLY REASONABLE COURSE OF ACTION IS PREVENTION. AND WHEN IT COMES TO LEADED PAINT PREVENTION IS A BIG. TOM I THINK THAT AT PRESENT IT'S VERY SAD TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT WE ONLY LEARN ABOUT LEAD HAZARDS IN HOMES BECAUSE CHILDREN BECOME POISONED THEY COME TO OUR ATTENTION HAVING ALREADY BEEN HARMED. AND WHAT WE THEN DO IS SEND OUR ENVIRONMENT SPECIALIST TO INSPECT THE HOUSE THEY TEST THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINT THEY LOOK FOR OTHER NO SOURCES OF LEAD. THE SOIL MAY ALSO BE TESTED IF IT'S APPROPRIATE. IF ONE IS DETECTED IN THE PAINT OR AT THAT WERE IN THE SOIL AT LEVELS ABOVE THE REGULATORY STANDARD. THAN APPROPRIATE PAYMENT IS RECOMMENDED. ENFORCEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS IN THE FORM OF EDUCATION AND ASSISTANCE WITH AMAZEMENT WE DON'T PUNISH. OUR GOAL IS TO HELP RESOLVE THE ISSUE. AFFECTED FAMILIES ARE GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT A BEING THE MESSAGES ABOUT BEING A PROFESSIONALS AND WE TRY TO ASSIST THEM WITH ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SUPPORT. WE ALSO TRY TO ASSIST THEM WITH TEMPORARY RELOCATION DURING THE ABATEMENT PROCESS. A PAYMENT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND AN OLDER VICTORIAN BUILT IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES OR FIFTIES IN COST FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INVADE A HOME THAT COSTS ARE NOT TRIVIAL. AND GIVEN THAT SO MANY OF THE IMPACT THEIR FAMILIES ARE POOR CONTAINMENT AND OTHER NON PERMANENT HAVE EVEN METHODS ARE OFTEN WHAT WE HAVE TO RELY ON. INSISTS RESULTING ABATEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX THE HAZARD PERSISTS. AND SO GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO THE LET. SO AGAIN OUR GOAL IN THESE CASES OF HELP ACHIEVE ABATEMENT NOT TO PUNISH WE DON'T USE LEANS AGAINST PROPERTY WE DON'T READ TAG THE RESIDENTS WE DON'T HAVE IT TENANTS ARE OCCUPANTS THERE'S NO. THERE'S SIMPLY NO POINT TO THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR HOME OUR FAMILIES ARE DISTRESSED INDEED ARE ASSISTANCE SO WE DON'T GO AFTER THEM IN THE SENSE OF PART OF TRYING TO PROVIDE HARM. YOU NOT SAY THAT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS PHILOSOPHICALLY. IS THAT THE LEAD PAINT ON THESE HOMES WAS APPLIED AT MINIMUM FORTY YEARS AGO. AND IN MOST CASES SEVENTY EIGHTY OR MORE YEARS AGO FAMILIES LIVING IN THOSE HOMES. THE OWNERS OF THOSE HOMES DID NOT PUT THAT HAZARD IN PLACE. SO IT MAKES NO SENSE TO BE TREATING THEM AS THE GUILTY PARTY FOR HAVING CREATED A HAZARD. AND THE COURTS CASE REAFFIRMS THAT IT IS IN FACT THE LEAD PAINT INDUSTRY THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THAT HAZARD IN THOSE HOMES. NOT AS FAR AS THE JUDGMENT IS CONCERNED I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE DO NOT DISPLACEMENT THAT JUDGMENT DOES NOT RESULT IN ANYONE BEING DISPLACED I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE CONCEPT OF HOMELESSNESS BEING INCREASE CAN EVEN BE BROUGHT UP IN THIS. THE IT'S NOBODY'S DISPLACED AND. WE DO NOT REDUCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD BE REDUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS EQUIVALENT TO ASSUMING THAT ONLY LEAD HAZARDS HOMES ARE AFFORDABLE WHICH IS CLEARLY NOT A TRUE STATEMENT. AND SO THAT JUXTAPOSITION DOES MAKE ANY LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THE POINT HERE IS THAT THE JUDGMENT ALLOWS US TO MAKE THE HOMES SAFER. DOESN'T MAKE THE MORE EXPENSIVE DOESN'T DISPLACE ANY. WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE THAT WE'VE WE'VE YOU YOU ALL HAVE TALKED A FAIR BIT ABOUT IT AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN OFFERS A NON LAWYER COME TO TO BETTER DESCRIBE THE PROBLEMS WITH THE INITIATIVE BUT I WILL OFFER. THAT OVERALL WITH THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE DOES IS IT DOES IS IT REMOVES KEY PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE SEEKING REMEDIES FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS THAT THEY HAVE INHERITED IN THEIR HOMES. AND FOR SEEKING ASSISTANCE WITH THE REMEDIATION OF A HAZARD CREATED BY THE PAINT MANUFACTURERS IT RETROACTIVELY MOVES TO JUDGMENT AGAINST MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD TO SALVAGE THEIR CULPABILITY. AND ELIMINATES THE JUDGMENT RELATED ABATEMENT FUND HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED WHICH WOULD PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE IMPACT OF FAMILIES. IT TRANSFERS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESSING THE HAS RECRUITED BY THE PAINT MANUFACTURERS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND IT DILUTES THE AVAILABLE MONEY FOR LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT BY MAKING THAT BOND FUND ADDRESS A FAR BROADER RANGE OF ISSUES. IT IT THERE WILL BE FAR LESS MONEY AVAILABLE FOR ABATEMENT IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF THINGS ONE. IS THAT WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE ABATEMENT FROM THE JUDGMENT. WILL HAVE ONLY A PORTION OF ANY MONEY THAT IS COLLECTED THROUGH THE BOND FUND AND HOMEOWNERS WILL LOSE ACCESS TO MONEY THROUGH LEGITIMATE LAWSUITS THAT THE PROVEN CULPABILITY WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PURSUE. SO IN ESSENCE WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS DOING IS MAKING CALIFORNIA'S PAY FOR SURE WHEN LANSING CONAGRA'S LIABILITY AND IT REALLY DOES REPRESENT SIMPLY A PAIN INDUSTRY BAILOUT. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO OUR FINAL WITNESS OF FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. SECOND. OKAY ó THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR CHAIR MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY MY NAME IS SERGEANT LOUDLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN A COURT OF ITS GENERAL POLICY OF NOT TAKING POSITIONS ON INITIATIVES UNTIL THEY'RE FORMALLY QUALIFIED IS NOT TAKING AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS INITIATIVE TODAY. SO I COME TO YOU NOT TO SPEAK FOR OR AGAINST THIS INITIATIVE. HOWEVER. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE AND MAKE CLAIMS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF CON AGRA WHICH HAVE RAISED CONCERNS AMONG OUR MEMBERS. AS WELL AS THE HOMEOWNERS WHO WITH WHOM OUR MEMBERS WORK SO CLOSELY. THESE CLAIMS HAVE REQUIRED US TO LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE HOLDING IN THE CASE AND ITS POTENTIAL AFFECT ON IN THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. SO I PURPOSE HERE TODAY IS TO OFFER OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE EFFECT OF CONAGRA'S DECISION ON INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE IT OUTLINED A PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. AS A RESULT OF CONAGRA. WE DISAGREE OF THESE CONTENT CONTENTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT ON HOMEOWNERS AND IN FACT BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE BASICALLY NO NEGATIVE EFFECT FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. SPECIFICALLY. THE DECISION DOES NOT TRIGGER NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR HOME SELLERS REGARDING LEAD PAINT HAZARDS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRED SELLERS AND THEIR AGENTS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SPECIFIED DISCLOSURES REGARDING LEAD PAINT BASE PAINT AND LEAD BASED PAINT HAZARDS. IN SALEM LEASE TRANSACTIONS FOR HOPE HOUSING BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. PRE CONAGRA CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL ALSO BOTH REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF KNOWN LEAD PAINT HAZARDS. FURTHERMORE FOR THE MORE PRE CON AGRA CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY HAS A PRESUMPTION THAT ANY HOME BUILT. PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOUSE LEAD PAINT. NOTHING IN THIS DECISION CREATE ANY NEW DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS BEYOND THAT CONTAINED IN EXISTING LAW REGARDING THE HAZARDS OF LEAD PAINT THE HAZARDS OF LEAD PAINT HAVE NOT CHANGED SO THE DISCLOSURES REMAIN THE SAME. CONAGRA'S IT'S BEEN STATED EARLIER BY BY OTHERS DOES NOT MAKE EVERY HOME A PUBLIC NUISANCE NOR DOES IT MAKE THE HOMEOWNER LIVE A FULL FOR A PUBLIC NUISANCE HAS BEEN AS HAS BEEN. CIRCULATED BY SOME OF THE PROPONENTS. THE COURT'S RULING FOUNDED THE DEFENDANT PAINT COMPANIES LIABLE FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE. DUE TO THEIR CONDUCT IN PROMOTING LEAD PAINT FRONTIER YOUR RESIDENTIAL USE WHILE KNOWING OF THE HOUSE IT WOULD CREATE. IT DID NOT FIND THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT IN AN INDIVIDUAL HOME IS A PUBLIC NUISANCE. BUT RATHER THAT THE OVERALL DANGER CREATED BY THE POLICE FRICTION OF LEAD PAINT. WAS A PUBLIC NUISANCE. SUCH A FINDING DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MAKE THE HOMEOWNER LIABLE FOR PUBLIC NUISANCE AS IS BEING CONSTANTLY SUGGESTED BY THE PROPONENTS. FURTHERMORE ANY SUCH FINDING OF LIABILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS IT ALSO BE SOMEWHAT ABSURD SINCE THE HOMEOWNERS EFFECTIVELY THE VICTIM AND WOULD BE PUTTING THE LIABILITY ON THE VICTIM OF THE ACTIONS OF THE DEFENDANT PAINT COMPANY. IT'S AN ALSO STATED THAT THE VALUE OF HOMES THAT CONTAIN LEAD PAINT WITH THIS DECREASE IN VALUE AS A RESULT OF THE HOLDING AND CON AGRA. THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. FIRST TO REITERATE THE NATURE OF LEAD PAINT HAS NOT CHANGED NOR HAS THE NATURE OF ITS HAZARDS. FURTHERMORE THE LAW ALREADY PRESUMES THAT LEAD PAINT IS PRESENT ON PRE IN PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PROPERTIES. ANY PRICE EFFECTS OF THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT MADE HAVE ON A PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PROPERTY HAVE PRESUMABLY ALREADY BEEN PRICED IN. IF ANYTHING THE STRONGER ARGUMENT IS THAT THE ABILITY TO TAKE PART IN FREE REMEDIATION PROGRAMS COULD INCREASE THE VALUE OF HOMES WHICH PARTICIPATE OR ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PROGRAMS. WE ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW CONAGRA CREATES AN UNFUNDED MANDATE OR INDEED ANY KIND OF MANDATE FOR HOMEOWNERS COVERED BY THE DECISION TO ABATE LEAD PAINT IN THEIR HOMES. TO QUOTE FROM THE DECISION REGARDING THE PAYMENT PLANS NO PROPERTY OWNERS ARE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE AND THEREFORE THEIR RIGHTS WILL NOT BE INVOLUNTARILY IMPACTED. FINALLY THE CREATION OF THE DATABASE MANDATED BY THE COURT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SORT OF CSUS SINISTER OR OTHER. NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT WE CAN SEE FOR THE HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PROPERTIES ARE ALREADY PRESENT TO HAVE LEAD PAINT. THEIR INCLUSION IN A DATABASE OF LEAD BASED PAINT PROPERTIES AT LEAD BASED PAINT SHOULD HAVE NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER. THE ONLY POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HOMER'S THAT WE THE HOMEOWNERS THAT WE DID SEE AND CON AGRA WAS TO READ RISK THE DEFENDANT PAINT COMPANIES COULD TRY TO SHIFT THE LIABILITIES. PARTICULAR HOMEOWNERS ARGUING THAT PARTICULAR HOMEOWNERS COULD CONCEIVABLY HAVE LIABILITY OR TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC NUISANCE. THAT CONCERN HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY RECENT PENDING LEGISLATION AB TO STE IS ZERO SEVENTY THREE. LEGISLATION WITH OUR ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS. IN CONCLUSION WHILE WE DO NOT TAKE A POSITION PRO OR CON ON THE INITIATIVE. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT THE CONAGRA DECISION WILL HAVE NEGATIVE AFFECT ON HOMEOWNERS AS HAS BEEN A REPRESENTED BY PROPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE. THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS I HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS JUST TO PUT IT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY. SO. OVER OFFICES HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF EMAILS AND AS WELL AS ONLINE ADS TARGETING US THAT ARE. A SUGGESTING THINGS ABOUT THE RECORD THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DISAGREE WITH STRONGLY SO LET ME JUST FIRST ASK IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS RULING. THAT RED TAGS FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION HOMES. ABSENT AYE MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK MS LAMB IF YOU COULD ANSWER ON BEHALF OF FOR IT OR ANYTHING. ANY THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL IS THERE ANYTHING THAT INCREASES LIABILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMES ABSOLUTELY NOT AND. IS THERE ANYWAY THIS RULING WOULD REWARD SLUMLORDS. NO ABSOLUTELY NOT ANY LIABILITY THAT SLUM LORDS HAD BEFORE OUR. RULING CAME DOWN CONTINUES TO BE APPLIANCE LANDLORDS SO IF THEY MAINTAIN A LEAD HAZARD ON THEIR PROPERTY THAT INJURED YOUNG CHILDREN THOSE YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN STILL SEE THOSE STORM LORDS. AND THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS WHO OWN HOME WITH LEAD PAINT COULD SOMEHOW BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS THAT A POSSIBILITY WITH THIS RULING. AGAIN ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND THERE'S ALSO SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW PROPERTY OWNERS COULD BE EXPOSED TO LAWSUITS NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT LEAD PAINT COMPANIES THEMSELVES OF SUGGESTED THAT THEY MIGHT BRING LAWSUITS BUT IS THERE ANYONE BEYOND LEAD. COMPANIES WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRING A LAWSUIT. AND SOMEHOW THAT'S ENHANCED BY THIS RULING. NO. OKAY.*. SINCE LAWYERS WERE INVOLVED I JUST AGAIN WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR FOR THE TELEVISION WATCHING PUBLIC. THE ATTORNEYS WERE SITTING AT THIS TABLE YOU REPRESENT PUBLIC COUNSEL SO YOUR SALARIES ARE PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY AND SO ARM AND IF YOU WERE TO PREVAIL. I ASSUME THAT. APART THE WORD MIGHT GO TO COMPENSATING YOU FOR TWENTY YEARS SAY A WORTH OF OF LITIGATION. THEY KNOW ME KNOW NOT COMPENSATE YOU IN PARTICULAR BUT NO WE ARE PLOY OR SOME OF THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO PAY BACK THE CITY FOR THE COSTS OF SUPPORTING OF OUR BOTH OUR ATTORNEYS ARE PARALEGALS ARE INVESTIGATORS. AND PROFESSIONALS THAT WORK ON THE CASE THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AND OTHERS TO PAY BACK TAXPAYERS FOUR PAIN FOR THE SALARIES OF YOU AND YOUR PREDECESSOR COLLEAGUES OVER THE. EXACTLY OKAY. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A SUGGESTION THAT BECAUSE AND EL INDUSTRY SETTLED FOR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE OTHER COMPANIES SHOULD NOT BE LIABLE FOR MUCH MORE. I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE MANY COMPANIES ARE STILL ON THE HOOK FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. CORRECT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MOTIVATED THE SETTLEMENT AND THIS THIS IS. PART OF THE PAPERWORK THAT WILL BE SUBMITTING VERY SHORTLY. IS AN ELSE. QUITE PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL CONDITION. THEY PAID AT THE THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IS FIFTEEN MILLION AND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT FIFTEEN POINT ONE MILLION. OF MONEY THAT WAS DEPOSITED BY ONE OF THEIR INSURERS WITH THE TRIAL COURT. EARLY ON IN THE LITIGATION THE OTHER A COMPONENT IS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM AN AL DIRECTLY WHICH IS ALMOST ALL OF THEIR AVAILABLE LIQUID RESOURCES. WORK WORD EFFECT AND IF I CAN PUT IT BLUNTLY WILL CLEAN UP THE COMPANY. I'M EN EL IS NOT REALLY AN OPERATING COMPANY ANYMORE THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE OPERATIONS AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. AND EXPRESSED TO US THAT NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THAT THEY WOULD ARE TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF BANKRUPTCY. SO ARE CHOICE WAS TO SETTLE FOR. MUCH LESS THAN WE THOUGHT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR. ARM OR GET NOTHING OR. FOR PENNIES FOR THE FUNCTIONALLY THE SAME THING DON'T YOU THE CHOICE CONFRONTING THE PLAN AND HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT SHERMAN WILLIAMS WHAT THEIR MARKET CAMPUS. SHORT ONES MARKET CAP OUR JUST HOW LARGE THEIR COMPANIES IT IS BUT I KNOW THE REVENUES OR WELL OVER BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. AND. THE COURT JUDGMENT THAT IS A QUESTION HERE ONLY. IS RELATED TO THE TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT YOU REPRESENTATIVE I CAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CITIES OF OAKLAND SAN DIEGO AND SAN CISCO THE COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA LOS ANGELES MONTEREY. SAN MATEO SANTA CLARA SOLANO AND VENTURA COUNTY SO AT THIS MOMENT THE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES AROUND STATE CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE RELIEF FROM THIS COURT JUDGMENT RIGHT. AND WHAT I HAVE HEARD ONE OF YOU MENTIONED MIGHT IN THE SLAMMER MIGHT'VE BEEN MISTER RAGLAN THE SUGGESTION MIGHT BE IF OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD RECEIVE THEIR FAIR DO UNDER THIS LAWSUIT WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT. OF THE COMPANIES BE ON THE HOOK FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HOMES. AT THE POTENTIALLY UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS THEREABOUTS AND FOR ALL PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOMES INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR LIMPING. AND THAT'S BEGAN JUST FOR PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HOME SO IF WE HAD ANY LIABILITY FOR HOMES. BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SAID IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT OR NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THAT'S A LARGE AMOUNT SORRY THAT IT WOULDN'T INCLUDE THAT ALL THE PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOMES A GREAT OKAY. AND I JUST FIND IT THERE WONDERFULLY COINCIDENTAL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF LIABILITY FOR THE STATE JUST FOR THIS PURSES. THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE PAIN COMPANIES WERE SUGGESTING THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR. AND. ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE LAWYERS ON AT THIS MOMENT EVERY YEAR WE HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM LEAD POISONING. MY UNDERSTANDING IS EVEN WITH THIS COURT JUDGMENT THERE'S NOT MONEY THAT'S GOING TO GO TO PAY FOR THE HEALTH COSTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS RIGHT IT'S SIMPLY GOING. FOR LEAD PAINT INSPECTION THEN CLEAN UP AND REMEDIATION FOR THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF HOMES BUT NOTHING TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE TWO DOCTORS ON TODAY'S PANEL WE'RE DISCUSSING. THAT'S GREAT THERE'S NO MEDICAL PAYMENTS BEING MADE IS ANYONE ESTIMATE THE COST TO SOCIETY OF THOSE MEDICAL PAYMENTS. WHAT I THINK EASY FIGURES THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT A DOLLAR SPENT ON ABATEMENT IS WORTH BETWEEN SEVENTEEN DOLLARS OF OF DAMAGE AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS? SO IF YOU TOOK THE TWO BILLION COST OF ABATEMENT MULTIPLIED BY SEVENTEEN I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE VERY LOW END FIGURE. OF THE HEALTH COSTS THAT ARE BEING AVOIDED. BY ABATING INSTEAD OF TREATING SO THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH TO STICK UP FOR HIM THAT'S VERY MUCH ON THE LOW END. OKAY. I'M IN A FINAL QUESTION TO. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM HOMEOWNERS GIVEN THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE HAPPENED GIVEN THE FACT THAT. BEFORE THIS RULING THE LEAD WAS ALREADY IN THE PAINT ON PEOPLE'S WALLS AND AFTER THIS RULING THAT IS STILL THE SAME NOTHING REALLY HAS CHANGED FROM THE. CORRECT BICU WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANY NEGATIVE OF RAMIFICATIONS FROM CON AIRCRAFT FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS. AND HAVE YOU SEEN A PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS WITH HOME PRICES. ANY IMPACT HOME PRICES BECAUSE OF LEAD PAINT OR THIS LAWSUIT WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY IMPACT OF REGARDING THIS AND AGAIN THE NATURE OF THE LEAD PAINT HAUSER HAS NOT CHANGED THAT LET'S PAINT HAZARD REMAINS THE SAME. AND SO PRESUMABLY THAT HAZARD IS. PRICED INTO THE HOMES WHICH THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THAT SO REALLY THE IMPACT OF THE LAWSUIT WAS SIMPLY TO FIND. THESE THREE COMPANIES LIABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED FOR WHAT THEY DID FOR WHAT THEY KNOWINGLY DID. CORRECT THAT'S ARE IMPEDING OKAY THANK YOU. WANNA ASK OUR COLLEAGUES IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER QUIRK. I'M. JUST TO SAY THE MARKET CAP FOR SHERMAN WILLIAMS IS AROUND THIRTY FIVE BILLION. AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ALL BEING HERE SORRY WE'RE RUNNING SO LATE I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MISS YOUR FLIGHT. ADDRESS. I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE INFORMATION I THINK IT'S SOME IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING. THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS AND DR I THANK YOU FOR GIVING US AN OVERSIGHT AN OVERVIEW OF. HOW OUR CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING AND THE FACT THAT THIS IS IRREPARABLE HARM? AND KNOWING THAT OUR CHILDREN SUFFER BECAUSE SOMEBODY KNOWINGLY. ALLOW THEM TO BE EXPOSED SOMETHING. AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY NOT TO PAY FOR THAT. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND FOR PROVIDING YOUR INPUT. SO LESS THERE ANY FINAL QUESTIONS OR JUST ASK IF ANY OF THE PANELISTS HAVE ANY FINAL YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE RECORD. IF NOT I'D LIKE TO ASK ALL THE WITNESSES IF YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SUBMIT YOUR PREPARED STATEMENTS TO THE RECORD SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THEM. AND A WITHOUT I WILL EXCUSE THIS PANEL THANK YOU AND ALL OF THE WITNESSES FOR COMING FORTH TODAY. WE WILL NOW GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER. I THINK WE'LL LEAVE FOR I COULD ASK HER HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY SO CAN EVER ROUGH IDEA. OF THAT SO WE CAN DECIDE YEAH. SO WE HAVE. QUITE YOU ALL COME FORWARD PERHAPS IF THERE NOT TOO MANY OF YOU YOU CAN ACTUALLY SIT HERE. AT THE TABLE AND I CAN GIVE YOU SOME TIME TO SPEAK. ONCE YOU COME FORWARD TO THE TABLE. ANYONE YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK. ALRIGHT ACCOUNT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT. RIGHT IS SO IF YOU COULD. GIVE YEAR AT GIVE A SPEECH IN ROUGHLY TWO MINUTES. AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE. TIME IS UP. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CECILIA CBI AND I AM A BOARD OF DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COULDN'T FORSMAN OFFICERS. AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COULDN'T FORSMAN OFFICERS. JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND OF CODE ENFORCEMENT AWARE TASK WITH THE PREVENTION DETECTION INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT OF VIOLATION SO. STATUTES OR ORDINANCES REGULATING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WELFARE. CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE PART ONE TITLE TEN SECTION THREE SEVENTY. DEFINES A PUBLIC NUISANCE AS ANYTHING AND VARIOUS TO HEALTH IN PART. THIS INITIATIVE WOULD COST CLICK CONTAMINATION TO CEASE BEING CONSIDERED A PUBLIC NUISANCE. IT'S CLEARLY DESIGNED TO WEEKEND% ENFORCEMENT AGAINST LEAD BASED PAINT VIOLATIONS AND IT ELIMINATES THE RESPONSIBILITIES AS ALREADY STATED. OF ENTITIES TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR DUTY TO PUBLIC IN REMOVING LEAD CONTAMINATION. IT IGNORES THE PROVEN SCIENCE AS STATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT THIS HEARING. OF THE OF FACTS CHILDREN AND CONSTITUENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S AFFECTS HUMAN BEINGS SPECIALLY AGAIN THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT AND TO HAVE IT STATED IN A BALLOT INITIATIVE. AS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE IS DISHONEST IT'S DANGEROUS AND IT'S AN OBVIOUS IMPAIRMENT. OF ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS BY RESPECTIVE CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ENSURE AND PREVENT ANY LEAD CONTAMINATION THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THEIR INSPECTIONS. SO AS LONG AS THERE ARE PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOUSING AND AS LONG AS THOSE STRUCTURES EXIST. THE WAY TO PREVENT ANY LEAD CONTAMINATION AND TO CONTINUE EFFORTS IN PROVIDING HEALTHY HOUSING. IS TO CONTINUE THE POSITIVE PROACTIVE RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAMS AN INSPECTION PROTOCOL SAYS PROVIDED BY COULDN'T FORSMAN APARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE URGE YOU TODAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PLEASE. REJECT THIS INITIATIVE AS IT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE TO THE EFFORTS OF CODE ENFORCEMENT APARTMENTS AND THE CONSTITUENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP WE CAN'T REJECT THE INITIATIVE. IT'S GONNA BE ON THE BALLOT OR IT ISN'T BUT THAT'S UP TO THAT PROPONENTS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S ALEXANDER HARDENED I'M A POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THIS INITIATIVE REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT TO CHARGE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES FOR CONTAMINATION THAT WAS KNOWINGLY INFLICTED UPON. LET US BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO PAYS FOR IT. THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE CONTINUE TO SUFFER THE EFFECTS. OF LEAD PAINT WHICH PERSISTS IN MANY HOMES AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IMPACTS OUR MOST VULNERABLE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS SUCH AS CHILDREN AND CONTENDS CONDEMNS THEM TO LIFELONG COGNITIVE DISABILITIES. MOREOVER IT IS PATENTLY OFFENSIVE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS INITIATIVE FURTHER SPARE HOUSING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES OR QUALITY HOUSING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AYE AS A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY UP PERSONALLY REPRESENTED. MULTIPLE SINGLE MOTHERS WHO WERE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEIR KIDS WERE POISONED BY THIS PAIN. I'M. LASTLY THE PROPONENT SEEK TO ENSHRINE A LEGAL FALSEHOOD THAT MAY OBSTRUCT FUTURE EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THIS CONTAMINATION. THE MARKETING AND SELLING OF LEAD PAINT. IS A PUBLICLY NUISANCE LEAD WAS BANNED FORTY YEARS AGO IT'S REGULATED BY EPA IT'S REGULATED BY TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. AND THE CDC HAS SAID THERE'S NO SAFE LEVELING OF EXPOSURE AND WE CANNOT. ENSHRINED THE FALSEHOOD THAT THIS SOMEHOW DOES NOT REPRESENT. A THREAT TO OUR SAFETY. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE STAND EXTREMELY OPPOSED TO THIS INITIATIVE THING. THANK YOU NEXT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MONTHLY THAT WAY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THE LOS ANGELES. AND ALSO FOR MANY YEARS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTHY HOMES COLLABORATIVE WHERE WE WERE ACTUALLY TRULY TRYING TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING. AN ARM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SAID IS THAT WE NEED PUBLIC POLICIES THAT STOPS USING CHILDREN AS LEAD DETECTORS. AND ONE OF THOSE POLICIES WAS ACTUALLY. HAVE LET'S SAY PRACTICES AND WE WERE WE KNEW ABOUT THIS SETTLEMENT AND WE KNEW THAT THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURES. TO PREVENT LEAD PAINT AND TO HEAR THE CYNICISM OF THE INDUSTRY INVOKE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS AND INVOKE THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE TO FIGURE DEFENDING AGAINST DISPLACEMENT. IS A PATENT FALSEHOOD AMONG ALSO HERE BECAUSE MY NIECE HAD OF ELEVATED LEAD LEVEL WHEN SHE WAS THREE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO ENROLL HER HOUSE IN HUNTINGTON PARK IN A LEAD ABATEMENT PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY INCREASE THE VALUE OF A HOME AT THAT TIME SHE WAS HAD A RENTAL UNIT. AND PART OF THAT AGREEMENT WAS THAT THE SHE COULD NOT IT EVICTED TENANT AND THERE WAS NONE OF THESE ISSUES SO THERE'S A WAY TO DO THESE PROGRAMS THAT WORK. THAT PROTECT CHILDREN FROM LEAD POISONING AND CLEAN UP OUR HOUSING STOCK AND. WE HOPE THAT THIS INITIATIVE DOESN'T GO THROUGH THAT SOMEHOW THESE GUYS FIND SOME PRINCIPLES AND NOT DO THIS. BECAUSE THE CLINIC THEY MADE THE MESS AND THEY SHOULD CLEAN IT UP. AND IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WE REALLY HOPE TO LEGISLATOR DOES COME UP WITH THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION THAT WILL STOP USING CHILDREN MISLED DETECTORS AND CLEAN UP OUR HOUSING STOCK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A NEXT. HELLO MY NAME IS LISA AT VAN FLEET AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. IS DONE AN EXTREMELY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS INITIATIVE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I PERSONALLY AS A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED IF THIS GOES FORWARD. I HAVE JUST SPENT THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS IN EUROPE. WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NGOS ACROSS THE WORLD WHERE LEAD PAINT IS MAKING A COMEBACK. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF THIS GOES THROUGH IN CALIFORNIA. THE REPERCUSSIONS WORLDWIDE WILL BE ENORMOUS. IT IS. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT SHERMAN WILLIAMS AND CONAGRA CAN MAKE THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS PAY FOR THEIR KNOWING POISONING OF OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO I'M MY NAME'S LAURA THE HEN AND AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE WITH CAL PARIKH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP. AND WE ALSO AND STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BALLOT MEASURE AND AND REALLY WERE OVERWHELMINGLY. CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT POSED BY LEAD EXPOSURE. AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S THIS LEGACY OF. YOU KNOW IT EXPOSED LAD AND RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT THERE WAS LITERALLY PLAY THEN PAINTED ON THE WALLS THAT'S NO. AFFECTING KIDS HEALTH WHAT THE KIDS WHO ARE.
