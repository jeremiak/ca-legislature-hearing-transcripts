00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.890
HAVE A PROPER NUTRITION.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.324
IN ORDER TO REACH THEIR FULL

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.593
ACADEMIC POTENTIALS I'M GONNA

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.262
TAKE A MOMENT OF PERSONAL

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.164
PRIVILEGE HERE JUST TO LET YOU

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.232
KNOW THAT -- OVER THE THIRTY

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.001
YEARS I TAUGHT IN ELEMENTARY

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:24.270
SCHOOLS -- THERE'S A RAY OF TYPE

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.538
OF LUNCH IS THAT WHETHER THE

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:26.772
STUDENTS BRING THEIR OWN LINES

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.307
OR BY LUNCH.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.608
AND SO FORTH.

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.677
BUT AS THE YEARS PROGRESSED FROM

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:34.046
MY EARLY YEARS OF BEING ABOUT

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:36.949
TWENTY ONE AND STARTING TO TEACH

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:39.218
TO MUCH OLDER.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.654
REALIZE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE --

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.488
PERFORMANCE IS BASED MANY MANY

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:43.989
TIMES ON HOW WELL OUR STUDENTS

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.158
ARE DOING NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:47.493
BUT ALSO IF THEY ARE HUNGRY

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.827
THERE CERTAINLY ARE NOT GOING TO

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.095
DO AS WELL SO IN A SIMPLE.

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:52.998
WAY THIS BILL SAYS THAT ALL K.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.667
TWELVE SCHOOLS SHOULD PROVIDE AT

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.702

REDUCED PRICE MEALS.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:03.676
NOW SOME SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DO

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:05.511
THAT IN MANY DO AND SOME NOT

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.546
ONLY DO ONE A MALE BUT THEY

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:08.981
ACTUALLY DO A BREAKFAST MAIL AS

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:11.016
WELL WE CAN GO ON TO ANOTHER

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.585
PIECE OF LEGISLATION ABOUT THE

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.420
NUTRITION FACTOR BUT FOR NOW

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:15.621
WE'LL FOCUS ON THE MILLS.

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.756
BUT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOLS WHO

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.158
MAYBE HAVE A VERY SMALL

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.627
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WE'D CALL

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:24.063

THE FREE AND REDUCED AND MANY

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.700
TIMES THEY DON'T GIVE THAT MAIL

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.935
TO THOSE STUDENTS EVEN IN PUBLIC

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:30.569
SCHOOLS.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.471
SO BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE ALL

TO HAVE A A KITCHEN DOES NOT

00:14:59.164 --> 00:14:59.732

REASON THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN

STRONGLY IN THE IDEA OF GETTING

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:11.155
THE BEST VALUE AND SPREADING THE

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.723
OF FACTORS THAT ARE NEEDED AND

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.125
NOT JUST LOWEST BIDDER.

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:16.527
I HAVING BEEN ON MANY

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:20.898

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.300
AIRPORT -- COMMISSION A AND ON

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:25.502
DOWN THE LINE I ALWAYS FOUND

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:26.837
THAT IT CAME BACK TO HAUNT US

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:30.140
WHEN WE WENT FOR LOWEST CHEAPEST

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.675
IT DIDN'T MATTER IT WAS ALWAYS

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.143

THE END.

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.114
I THINK THIS IDEA OF GETTING THE

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:40.617
BEST VALUE -- SHOULD BE SPREAD.

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.286

CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY --

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.722
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS I THINK IT

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.957
SHOULD BE USED AS A MODEL FOR

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:49.093
ALL OF THE WORK THAT -- AND

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:51.628
CONTRACTS THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IN

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:54.131

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:56.633
MOVE THE BILL.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.502

TAKE THE LOW BID.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:04.975
AND THERE'S ONLY TWO TIMES WE'RE

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.176
ABLE TO KICK IT OUT BECAUSE

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:10.714
THERE'S CLEARLY NOT -- NOT TRUE --

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:11.982
AS YOU KNOW THE WORST WORDS YOU

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:18.789
GREAT CONCEPT I BELIEVE THIS IS

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:21.191
ALSO A PILOT PROGRAM IS A PIPE

THE CSU OPPOSES THIS BILL FOR

AND ADDRESSING SALARY INVERSIONS.

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:35.832
IN REALITY THE STAFF WHO WOULD

OUR LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES SUCH

AS GROUNDSKEEPERS AND CUSTODIANS.

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:42.773
TO INCLUDE ARE HIGHLY HIGHLY

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.141
COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES SUCH AS

ACCOUNTANTS ENGINEERS AND IT

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.044
PERSONNEL. FOR THE MORE THE BILL

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:49.513
WOULD INCREASE THE SALARIES OF

ALL STAFF AT THE SAME RATE

00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.115

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.383
THE EFFECT WOULD BE TO

PERPETUATE AND COMPOUND ANY

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.953
SALARY INEQUITIES THAT MAY EXIST

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.455
AS A RESULT OF INVERSION IT FOR

00:50:58.522 --> 00:50:59.823
COMPRESSION.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.792
SECONDLY THE COST IMPACTS OF THE

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.326
BILL ARE SIGNIFICANT AND WHILE

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:04.961
THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE IS

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.997
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ANY

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.866

FINALLY THE IN PERHAPS THE MOST

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.382
IMPORTANT REASON WE OPPOSE THE

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.950

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.556
CURRENTLY HAVE WITH OUR

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:34.224
BARGAINING UNITS EXPIRE IN THE

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:35.358
NEXT YEAR.

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:36.193
THE BILL SO THE DANGERS

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.527
PRESIDENT UNDERMINES THE EFFORTS

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:39.162
OF OUR BOARD TO NEGOTIATE FAIR

00:51:39.229 --> 00:51:40.897
COMPENSATION WITHIN THE FISCAL

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.532
REALITIES OF OUR FUNDING NOT

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.600
ONLY WAS CSU REVIEW.

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:44.768
BUT WITH ALL OTHER BARGAINING

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:47.070
UNITS AS WELL WITH ME TODAY IS

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:47.904
JOHN'S WERE BACK THIS UC'S

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.439
ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR OF

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.107
LABOR AND EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AND

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.843
OUR LEAD NEGOTIATOR. TO DISCUSS

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.244
THE FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THE

00:51:54.311 --> 00:51:55.645
BILL THANK YOU.

00:51:55.712 --> 00:52:00.417
THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED MORNING.

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.451
SO THERE WAS A REASON WHY THE

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:04.387
BOARD MOVED FROM THE STEPPING

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.890
CREASES TO OPEN RANGES AND THAT

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.525
WAS BECAUSE THE STATE

00:52:08.592 --> 00:52:10.794
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.629
THAT IT FUNDED THE CSU.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.731
UP UNTIL THAT POINT OUR FUNDING

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.199
WAS DERIVED LARGELY FROM A

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.068
SERIES OF FORMULAS.

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:19.236
AND THAT WAS KNOWN AS ORANGE

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:19.736
BOOK FUNDING.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.005
AND AS PART OF THAT PROCESS

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:24.941
THESE -- INDIVIDUAL SALARY

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.243
INCREASES.

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:27.978
I RIGHTLY BY THE STATE SO IT WAS

00:52:28.044 --> 00:52:29.279
A LINE ITEM IN OUR BUDGET.

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:30.247
DURING ONE OF THE RECESSIONS IN

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.082
THE NINETIES THE STATE.

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.084
DECIDED THAT THE CENTURY THE CSU

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.218
WOULD JUST RECEIVE A BLOCK OF

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:36.386
MONEY AND WE DON'T HAVE TO

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.088
ALLOCATE HOW WE SPEND THAT MONEY

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.723
BASED ON OUR COMPETING

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.224
PRIORITIES.

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:42.626
SO WITHIN THAT CONTEXT IT WAS

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:45.495
CONSIDERED BY POLICY TO BE --

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:47.531
GUARANTEEING SALARY INCREASES

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:49.132
WITHOUT THERE BEING ANY

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.201
CONCURRENT GUARANTEE AS TO

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.202
FUTURE REVENUES.

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.803
SO WE MOVED TO AN OPEN RANGE

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.871
SYSTEM.

00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.206
AND THE RATIONALE FOR THAT MOVE

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.575
IS AS RELEVANT TODAY AS IT WAS

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:01.878
THEN -- I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:04.214
ROOM DURING THE RECESSION WHEN

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:05.916
WE RECEIVE THE COLD TELLING US

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:06.516
THAT WE HAD TO BE CHIU SOUGHT

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.285
BUDGET BY FIVE HUNDRED NINETY

00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:09.386
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE THE

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.887
START OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.722
WHICH WAS A MATTER OF A FEW

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:13.523
WEEKS AWAY.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.425
AND EVEN WITH WHAT I RECALL WITH

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:17.360
THE LARGEST TUITION INCREASES

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.762
AND SEE ISSUES HISTORY -- WE

00:53:18.828 --> 00:53:19.896
STILL HAD TO TAKE OTHER

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.932
EXTRAORDINARY MATCHES I WAS THE

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:25.335
PERSON NEGOTIATED THE FELLOWS I

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.736
OVER SO MANY LAYOFFS WE HAD TO

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.404
DO.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:28.672
AND EVEN WITH ALL OF THOSE

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.006
MEASURES IN PLACE THERE WAS

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:30.874
STILL.

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.510
A CLEAR REDUCTION IN OUR ABILITY

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.278
TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF SERVICES

00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:39.416
WHICH WE ASPIRE TO PROVIDE TO

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.217
OUR STUDENTS.

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:42.152
SO TO THAT.

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.787
MOST OF THE STAFF EMPLOYEES

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.121
ENDED UP GOING SIX SHE IS

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:47.257
WITHOUT SALARY INCREASES -- WE

00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:50.226
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WAS A GREAT

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:51.428
BURDEN ON THEM.

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:54.664
HI AND AS THE ECONOMY IS PICKED

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:55.832
UP WE DID TAKEN.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:57.367
SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO TRY AND

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.235
ADDRESS THE RESIDUAL EFFECTS OF

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.404
THAT PERIOD.

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.273
WITH VERY DIFFERENT TO THE STATE

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.641
AGENCY IS MOST OF THE STATE

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.408
AGENCIES THE GOVERNOR WILL

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:08.011
NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITS.

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.145
THEY'LL AGREE SALARY AND THEN

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.881
THE BUDGET WILL BE ALLOCATED TO

00:54:11.948 --> 00:54:13.316
TO MEET THAT NEED.

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:15.418
WITH AS WE GET A LUMP OF MONEY

00:54:15.485 --> 00:54:16.586
AND THEN WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.688
OUR SALARIES WITH OUR UNIONS.

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.857
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.026
THE MONEY WE RECEIVE WILL COVER

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:26.563
OUR ALL OUR PRIORITIES -- WHICH

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.031
ARE OFTEN COMPETING ON OLD ME T

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.900
MISSION CRITICAL YOUR TIME IS UP

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.202
SO IF YOU CAN WRITE A SEVEN

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:33.570
ABOUT ONE ADDRESS A VISION VERY

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:34.871
QUICKLY. ONE THING THAT HAS ME

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.072
MENTION THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF

00:54:36.139 --> 00:54:38.274
INVASION IN THE CSU IS NOT

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.543
EXTERNAL HIRES ITS INTERNAL

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.079
HIGHS -- WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHICH

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:43.913
GIVES PRIORITY FOR HIGHER TO

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.015
EXISTING EMPLOYEES WE'VE

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:46.349
RECENTLY AGREED TO ANYONE

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.418
MEETING MINIMAL QUALIFICATIONS

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:50.253
GETS INTERVIEWED -- WE HAVE THE

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.722
VISION THE CPA THAT SAYS THAT IF

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:53.990
SOMEBODY MOVES TO BACK HIGHER

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:57.127
CLASSIFICATION. TO HAVE A SALARY

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:59.462
SET UP 5% ABOVE THE CURRENT

00:54:59.529 --> 00:54:59.796
SALARY.

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:01.231
SO IF YOU RUN A DATE TO REPORT

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:02.165
TO THE INDIVIDUAL WILL LOOK LIKE

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:02.832
CAN YOU HIGHER INTO THE

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:04.134
CLASSIFICATION.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.301
I WILL NOT REFLECT THE FIGHT

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:08.405
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TWENTY OR

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.039
TWENTY FIVE YEARS SAID THIS IN A

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:09.439
DIFFERENT CLASS.

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:10.774
SO IN VERSION IS NOT JUST THE

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.309
CASE OF LOCAL MARKETS BEING SET

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.045
IT'S BY AND LARGE A CREATURE OF

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.180
OUR INTERNAL PRACTICES TO

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:19.015
INCREASE SOCIAL MOBILITY AMONGST

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:20.517
OUR STAFF EMPLOYEES.

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.152
VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANY

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.620
ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION.

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:25.455
BEFORE I GO TO THE COMMITTEE I

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.290
WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- THIS IS A

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:28.825
BIG PROBLEM AND WHEN YOU HAVE

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.593
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:31.661
TEN YEARS AND YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:32.862
WHO'S BEEN WORKING FOR THREE

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:35.265
YEARS AND THEY MAKE THE SAME OR

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:35.832
VERY CLOSE TO IT.

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.233
IT CREATES A HUGE MORALE PROBLEM

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.234
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.270
DESCRIBING AS YOUR INTERNAL

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:41.438
STRUCTURE PROVENCHER INTERNAL

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.972
STRUCTURE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.307
SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD FIX.

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:46.443
SO I'M JUST MAKING THAT COMMENT --

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:47.977
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN THE

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.345
LABOR MOVEMENT FOR MANY YEARS

00:55:49.412 --> 00:55:50.747
AND SAW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU

00:55:50.814 --> 00:55:52.582
HIRED SOMEONE AND THEY CAME IN

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:53.950
THEY WERE MAKING CLOTHES OR THE

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:55.952
SAME AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:56.753
FOR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.787
CREATES A HUGE MORAL PROBLEM IT

00:55:57.854 --> 00:56:00.190
DOESN'T SHOW YOUR EMPLOYEES WHO

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:02.425
HAVE STAYED WITH YOU AND BEEN

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:03.927
THERE BEEN LOYAL WORKERS -- THAT

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.595
YOU VALUE THEM SO I WOULD JUST

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:07.764
SAY THAT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.232
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT OR I THINK

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:09.933
YOU WILL CONTINUE JUST.

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:12.001
LIKE THIS UNTIL WE SEE PARITY

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:14.137
WITH ADAM AND OPEN IT UP TO THE

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:16.306
THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.074
COMMENTS CONCERNS.

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.743
CASING AND HEARING NONE ASSEMBLY

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:20.577
WOMAN WHICH I TO CLOSE RIGHT I

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:21.745
WANT I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.913
CAME TODAY FOR THIS PARTICULAR --

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.649
PRESENTATION YOU KNOW I HAVE THE

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.485
THE GOOD FORTUNE I GUESS AND AND

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:29.919
AS SOMETIMES THE SAME CHALLENGE

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:31.755
OF HAVING WORKED FOR C. ISSUE

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:32.889
FOR FORTY YEARS AS A FACULTY

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:33.356
MEMBER.

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:34.791
AND AS A CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:35.925
AND I WAS THERE WHEN THIS TOOK

00:56:35.992 --> 00:56:37.727
PLACE NOT ONLY DID IT HAPPEN TO

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:38.495
THIS GROUP BUT IT HAPPENED TO

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:39.462
OTHER GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:41.531
SYSTEM THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE.

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:42.565
TO NEGOTIATE AND GET THERE'S

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:43.299
BACK OF THIS REMAINS A FINAL

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:45.401
GROUP THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.070
GET THE BEARD INCREASE THIS IS

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:48.471
NOT AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE.

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:49.773
A THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE YOU

00:56:49.839 --> 00:56:51.241
MARRIED AND YOU HAVE TO BE

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.742
EVALUATED IN ORDER TO GET IT AND

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:54.744
IT ONLY HAPPENS IF THE RESOURCES

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:55.378
ARE AVAILABLE.

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.213
SO IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC ACROSS

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.848
THE BOARD REYES -- IS PRETTY

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.450
MUCH SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO HERE

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.285
IN THIS HOUSE WHEN WE EVALUATE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.853
OUR OUR CURRENT STAFF -- WE MAY

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.623
GIVE THEM 5% OR 10% ADDITIONAL

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:07.991
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE WHAT THE

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:09.292
MARKET IS DOING BUT ALSO WITH

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.226
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING IN

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.828
THE HOUSE AND THAT IS ON TOP OF

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:14.197
THE 2% OF 3% RAISE A WHATEVER

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:15.565
THAT'S THE THAT IS WHAT THIS IS

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:17.300
ABOUT -- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:23.406
DOES NOT FACILITATE THE KIND OF

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:26.042
MORALE THAT WE TALK A OUT I KNOW

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.610
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN THERE.

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.845
SINCE NINETY SIX AND WHO ARE

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:29.078
STILL.

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:31.080
IN WITH THE SAME SALARY AND THE

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.882
INVERSION PIECE THAT'S THERE --

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:33.917
THREE SIXTY TWO RETURNS POLICY

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.418
THAT WE HAD TO PAY EMPLOYEES AND

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:36.352
AT THE SAME WAY WE DO IT MANY OF

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:37.387
OUR MANAGEMENT WE GET THE MERIT

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:38.087
INCREASES 1020%.

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:38.721
OFTENTIMES TO THE PRESIDENT AND

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.356
THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:41.758
IS THAT OF THE I. WHY TO KEEP

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.026
THEM EMPLOYED JUST LET THEM KNOW

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:43.960
THAT THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB AND

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:44.661
TO MERIT IT.

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:47.030
THE 5% INCREASE IS ON PAR WITH

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:49.032
OTHER SEE ISSUE STAFF -- THAT

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:49.933
WAS THERE NINETY SIX AND IS IN

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.668
LINE WITH OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:52.435
IN TERMS OF WHAT AMERICA

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:53.703
INCREASE WOULD BE BUT IT IS NOT

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:56.072
AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE IT IS A

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:56.973
MERIT INCREASE.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.408
AND AS CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT I

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:00.677
HAD TO EVALUATE MY STAFF.

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.245
AND A AND A GREAT RECOMMEND WHAT

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:02.879
THE NOT THEY WOULD GET MARRIED

00:58:02.946 --> 00:58:04.314
INCREASES THOSE WITH A WIN

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.582
NINETY SIX UNFORTUNATELY.

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.150
AGAIN THESE ARE AS I SAID THEY

00:58:07.217 --> 00:58:08.551
WILL BE THEY WILL BE MARRIED

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.853
THEY WOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC --

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.321
SEE ISSUE HAS UNILATERALLY

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:13.022
ELIMINATED THIS MERIT BASED STEP

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.390
SO INCREASES OUTSIDE OF THE

00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.792
BARGAINING PROCESS AND THAT'S

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.227
WHAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.895
OFTEN HEAR THE ARGUMENTS THIS

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:19.729
SHOULD BE DONE IN COLLECTIVE

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.364
BARGAINING IT WAS TAKEN AWAY

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.633
OUTSIDE OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.134
AND IT HAS AN AND DESPITE THE

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:26.502
EFFORTS TO TRY TO WORK TO BRING

00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:28.805
IT BACK DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:29.305
THIS HOUSE.

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:31.441
THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY IN

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:33.109
THE LAST YEAR SO PASSED THIS

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:35.078
BILL UNANIMOUSLY IN THE GOVERNOR

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:37.380
VETOED IT BASICALLY EMPHASIS --

00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:39.148
KIND OF REFERRING TO THE FACT

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.884
THAT HEY YOU.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:41.951
TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THIS IN

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:42.585
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT THREE

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:43.887
YEARS THEY STILL HAVE NOT TAKEN

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:44.687
THE ISSUE UP AND THEY'VE NOT

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.389
DONE IT AND IT'S NOT LIKELY

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:47.724
BASED ON THE CONVERSATION WE

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.524
HEAR THAT THEY WILL TAKE IT UP

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:48.992
AGAIN.

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.793
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.394
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.496
AND IT REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.331
MEASURE NORMALLY AS A SAID I'VE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:55.932
BEEN INVOLVED WITH COLLECTIVE

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:58.067
BARGAINING WAS A PART OF THE

00:58:58.134 --> 00:58:59.269
FACULTY WOULD CF.

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:00.203
WHEN THE CFA AND OTHERS GOT

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.870
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNDERSTAND

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:01.971
THE PROCESS AND WHAT IT'S ALL

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.406
ABOUT BUT THIS IS A SITUATION

00:59:03.473 --> 00:59:05.074
THAT IS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY AND

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.142
THEY HAVE STRUGGLE TO TRY TO DO

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:07.176
IT IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING?

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.912
AND HAS NOT BEEN AN APPETITE ON

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.013
THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:12.115
TO DO THAT AND SO WHEN WE TALK

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:13.650
ABOUT SHOULD GO IN THAT WAY THE

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:14.884
GOVERNOR HAS COSTLY MADE

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.252
REFERENCE TO IT WE HAVE MADE

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.154

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:24.961
BEEN TAKEN UP.

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:25.561
SO AFTER THREE YEARS WE REALLY

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:26.963
NEED TO TAKE A STEP AND DO

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.563

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.791
SO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.060
INEQUITIES IN FUNDING HAVE BEEN

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.396

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:02.939

BECAME EXACERBATED OVERTIME

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:06.676
BECAUSE COAL ON A HUNDRED

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:07.977

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- YOU KNOW

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:50.265
THE FUTURE SHINS I TEND TO SEE

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.599
OUT FAMILIES AFTER THEY HAVE

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.435
THEIR CHILDREN -- ME I THINK

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.769
THAT -- WE'VE SEEN A LOT THERE'S

01:22:54.836 --> 01:22:55.870
A LOT OF DATA AND RESEARCH

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:57.205
SHOWING THE BENEFIT OF LEAVE FOR

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.840
THE CHILD BUT ALSO FOR THE

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:02.544
FAMILY OVERALL.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.112
AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.613
TO SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE WHO

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.614
ACTUALLY HAS TO DO THE WORK OF

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:09.150
TEACHING OUR KIDS -- THIS WOULD

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.018
TO ME BE A GOOD IDEA SO I

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:12.220
UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.455
CHALLENGES THAT.

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.956
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ON THE

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.225
FISCAL SIDE BUT ULTIMATELY.

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:18.226
PART OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:20.228
MONEY ON IS TO BE SURE THAT WE

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:22.464
CAN GET THAT KIND OF WORK FORCE

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:23.565
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:24.866
ACTUALLY PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:25.500
WANT.

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:28.169
AND SUPPORTING THAT WORKFORCE TO

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:30.138
BE.

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.006
IN A WAY THAT -- WE I THINK

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.007
THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWED

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.743
THE BENEFIT WOULD MAKE SEEM TO

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:35.577

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.345
REASONABLE INVESTMENT OF EVEN

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.152
HAVE TO WAIT ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:44.919
BUDGET THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO PASS.

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:46.921

STATES BUT STILL.

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:53.094
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:56.364
OPPOSITION IS ABOUT.

01:23:56.431 --> 01:24:00.068

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.031

ALL OF THE SUPPORT.

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:15.810
IN ORDER TO PROPERLY TAKE THEIR

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.313
LEAVE AND THAT WE ALSO IN

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.681

SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:27.388
LOOK AT THE STATE DISABILITY

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:28.590

EXISTENCE.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.359
LET'S NOT CREATE SOMETHING THAT

WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ANY

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.702
MONEY.

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.170
FOR THE STARTING WHEN THIS BILL

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.938
TAKES EFFECT JANUARY FIRST WE

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.473
WOULD HAVE A DEFICIT IN OUR

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.408
BUDGETS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:49.477

OKAY I UNDERSTAND CHALLENGE OF A

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:58.620
LONG TERM SUBSTITUTE AND PERHAPS.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:00.455
ACTUALLY SHORTENS OF TO TRY MORE

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:01.322
OF AN ISSUE A LONG TERM --

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:08.763

REALLY TRULY BE A SUBSTITUTE IN

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:13.535
SOME SENSES BUT I THINK

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:14.269
ALTERNATIVE YOU'RE SAYING IS A

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.036
TEACHER WHO [inaudible]

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.138

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.273
BALANCE THAT CHILD TRYING TO

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:19.607
PROVIDE CARE FOR THAT CHILD.

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:20.608
INSTEAD WE'RE GONNA SAY IS THERE

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:21.376

CLASSROOM WHILE THEY'RE ALSO

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:22.877
WORRIED ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:23.878
OF EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN.

01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:24.946
THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:25.647
ME THAT THAT'S A BETTER

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:26.381
ALTERNATIVE.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.683
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST TO BE THERE

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.718
IT'S PREGNANCY THE NOT OCCUR

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:31.553
PREGNANCY LEAST RIGHT IT'S IN

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:32.186
SOME WAYS I MEAN IT DEPENDS HOW

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.388
YOU LOOK AT IT BUT IT'S EVEN I

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:34.722
THINK FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT.

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:36.791
MORE OFFENSIVE THAT YOU CAN'T --

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.060
TAKE A MEDICAL LEAVE WHEN YOU

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:40.562

THEY HAVE A HOST OF

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:56.377
COMPLICATIONS -- THEY HAVE TO

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.046
USE UP ALL THEIR SICK TIME THEIR

01:26:58.112 --> 01:26:58.980
VACATION TIME AND THE PAID

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.114
DEFERENTIAL BASICALLY PAY FOR

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:02.684
THEIR OWN SUBSTITUTE IN ORDER TO

COURSE SOME POINT THAT CAN BE

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:05.653
FOR RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'VE

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.522
HEARD SOME STORIES ABOUT THAT AS

QUITE SURPRISING TO ME.

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:27.075
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.477
CONVERSATION FROM DECADES AGO --

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.479
THAT WAS TAKING PLACE I DON'T

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:34.248
TAKE LIGHTLY THE FISCAL ISSUES

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.918

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.188
THROUGH TO BALANCE THINGS OUT

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:43.725
BUT THIS IS SOME THIS IS NOT A

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:44.993

TO I ALSO SEE IS A PAY EQUITY

01:27:58.706 --> 01:27:59.641
ISSUE.

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:01.342
UP TO SAY THAT.

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.944
WOMEN.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:04.979
BECAUSE ONLY WOMEN WE'RE GONNA

EQUITY ISSUE WE WILL NEVER HAVE

01:28:19.093 --> 01:28:22.130
THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE VACATION

01:28:22.196 --> 01:28:24.098

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.040
I CAN'T.

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:34.876
IMAGINE NOT SUPPORTING THIS

01:28:34.942 --> 01:28:37.278
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR.

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:41.616
OTHER CAUGHT QUESTION.

01:28:41.683 --> 01:28:43.651
IT IS ALREADY BEEN MOVED BY

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:44.819
SENATOR CHIANG AND WOULD YOU

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.087

WOULD YOU KNOW AM I IT CARRY

01:28:47.021 --> 01:28:47.588
THIS LAST YEAR WE'RE DOING IT

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:48.756
AGAIN AND I JUST RECENTLY.

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:50.725
LEARNED HOW WE'VE GOTTEN TO THIS

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:51.659
POSITION.

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:52.827
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE OF

01:28:52.894 --> 01:28:55.329
COURSE KEYCHAIN AND AND EVEN

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:57.899
FACULTY MEMBERS WAS A LARGELY

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:59.233
WOMEN PROFESSION.

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.169
AND THE ORIGINAL FIGHT WAS

01:29:01.235 --> 01:29:02.136
WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.338
CONTINUE TO TEACH WHEN THEY WERE

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:05.907
SHOWN AS PREGNANT.

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:08.109
I'M SO WHILE THEY WERE FIGHTING

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.578
THAT FIGHT WE WERE PROVIDING A

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:12.246
BASIS FOR OTHER WOMEN OUTSIDE

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:15.016
THAT PROFESSION TO GAIN OTHER

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:19.921
RIGHTS SO.

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.422
AN EQUAL KIND OF FIGHT MOVING

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:22.957
FORWARD -- AND THERE WAS A

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:25.093
BELIEF THAT YOU JUST SHOULD HAVE

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:26.094
YOUR BABY DURING THE SUMMER.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.230
YOU KNOW -- WHEN A WOMAN IS

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.665
PREGNANT AND SHE HAS TO TAKE

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:32.400
SICK LEAVE BECAUSE PREGNANCY

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:33.868
LEAVE WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE HER

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.570
WHEN SHE HAS A NEWBORN?

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:37.438
RIGHT I MEAN THE REASON WE HAVE

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:38.906
SICK LEAVE IT IS SO THAT WE CAN

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.141
TAKE CARE OF NOT ONLY OURSELVES

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.609
BUT OUR CHILDREN YOU'RE PUTTING

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:44.245
THEM IN A POSITION THAT EVEN IF

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:45.680
WE SAID OKAY FINE.

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.482
WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THE SD I

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:48.716
PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA JOIN THE THE

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:51.753
PROGRAM THAT IS EIGHTY ONE POINT

01:29:51.819 --> 01:29:52.520
1%.

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:53.755
PAYCHECK DEDUCTION FOR EVERY

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.123
TEACHER THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.957
TELLING TEACHERS YOU NEED TO

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:58.493
TAKE -- EIGHT EIGHT PAY DECREASE

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.061
IN ORDER TO PART TO BE PART OF

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.429
THE SYSTEM THAT BY THE WAY IS

01:30:01.496 --> 01:30:03.164
ONLY GOING TO PAY YOU 60% OF

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:04.432
YOUR SALARY YOU'RE STILL AT IT

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.300
AT A DEFICIT.

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:08.202
SO I THINK IN A A PROFESSION

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:10.304
THAT IS OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN

01:30:10.371 --> 01:30:12.940
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WE

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:14.408
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:15.977
THE NUMBER ONE REASON WOMEN

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.780
LEAVE THE TEACHING -- FIELD IT

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:20.047
HAS TO DO WITH FAMILY CHOICE

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:20.481
RIGHT.

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:22.150
IT ACTUALLY I WOULD ARGUE IN THE

01:30:22.216 --> 01:30:23.017
LONG RUN IT'S GOING TO SAVE

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:25.453
SCHOOLS MONEY TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.454
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR TEACHERS

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.222
AND HAVE THAT TEACHER COME BACK

01:30:28.289 --> 01:30:29.690
AS AN EXPERIENCED TEACHER THAN

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:30.892
SAY ONCE I GET PREGNANT IT'S

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.226
JUST NOT WORTH IT TO CONTINUE IN

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:33.795
THIS FIELD.

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:34.362
SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.496
TOTAL COST OF TO TOTAL COST TO

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:36.998
THE TO THE STUDENTS OF COURSE TO

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:38.966
THE TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION

01:30:39.033 --> 01:30:40.501
AND WE THE TOTAL VALUE OF THAT

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.769
WE PLACE ON TEACHERS I THINK WE

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.437
ALL I WOULD HOPE WE ALL BELIEVE

01:30:43.504 --> 01:30:44.772
TEACHERS ARE UNDERPAID.

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:45.907
AND AND TO SUGGEST THAT THE

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:48.409
SOLUTION IS TO TAKE WAY MORE

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:50.211
THEIR SALARY I THINK IS IS SHORT

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.245
SIGHTED AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO

01:30:51.312 --> 01:30:52.513
HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.115
INCOME REPLACEMENT MORE TALKING

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.550
ABOUT LEAVE WHETHER IT'S

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:56.951
PREGNANCY LEAVE OR WHAT WHETHER

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:58.286
IT'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE OBVIOUSLY

01:30:58.352 --> 01:30:58.920
THAT'S SOMETHING I'M.

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.354
WORKING ON A DIFFERENT BILL BUT

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.789
YOU KNOW THIS IS PART OF THAT

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:03.224
DISCUSSION AND I THINK IT'S TIME

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.725
THAT WE WE START WITH TEACHERS

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.328

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:09.564

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:16.804

THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR

01:33:41.749 --> 01:33:43.851
I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- I

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:44.585
WON FIRST KNOWLEDGE THE GREAT

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:45.920
WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.722
DONE TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL AID

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:49.857
REFORM AND TO LOOK AT COVERING

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.192
THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION.

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:52.493
I'M YOU KNOW TEXT BOOKS

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.495
TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING --

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:56.797
BUT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY WOULD

01:33:56.864 --> 01:33:59.900
GIVE STUDENTS.

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.135
ACCESS TO EMERGING REAL THE

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.204
EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS IN CASE

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.839
OF UNFORESEEN HARDSHIPS -- TO

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.674
PUT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR INSTANCE

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:10.845
THIS -- THIS YEAR WE'VE SEEN THE

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.880
BUTTE CAMPFIRE IT DISPLAYS A LOT

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:15.216
OF INDIVIDUALS STUDENTS CANNOT

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.785
GO TO CLASS -- AND WHEN NATURAL

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:21.288
DISASTERS LIKE THAT HAPPEN --

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.891
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STILL

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:24.759
KEEP IN CONTACT WITH THE

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.694

AFTER -- THIS IS THE RESULT --

01:34:29.063 --> 01:34:30.498
BUT FINANCIAL AID IN ITSELF IS

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:33.200
NOT ENOUGH TO COVER AND PROVIDE

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.502
STABILITY FOR THAT STUDENT AND

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:37.071
SO GIVING THIS ESTABLISHING THIS

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:40.141
