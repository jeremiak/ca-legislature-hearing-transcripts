GET OFF THEIR HOPE YOU A DICTION- GET STABILITY BACK IN THEIR LIVES AND GO BACK TO WORK BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT BETWEEN- WHAT EMPLOYERS THINK IS BEING- ON DRUGS IN BEING INTERACTING WITH THAT THE WORKPLACE IN BEING- AT- ON MEDICATION TO DEAL WITH IS ACTUALLY A DISABILITY THAT YOU HAVE TO GET BACK INTO- MAINSTREAM OF SOCIETY AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WORK WHERE CLARIFYING- CODIFYING PROTECTIONS FROM THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT IN THE STATE LAW. THAT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN ADDICTION AN OPIOID ADDICTION CAN GET ON THIS TREATMENT- WITH THE SUPERVISION OF THEIR OF THEIR DOCTOR AND GET BACK TO WORKING BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED RATHER HAVE THAT THAN THEM- BEING ON THE PUBLIC DOLE- SO WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE ISSUES AND HOW WE IF THIS PASSES TODAY WILL WILL WORK WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IN THE CHAIR AFTER FURTHER I WORK ON ISSUES BEST RELATE TO LABOR THANK YOU. BYE THANK YOU AND AS ALWAYS EACH SIDE HAS. UP TO SIX MINUTES AND YOU CAN DIVVY IT UP ANYWAY YOU'D LIKE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RACHEL L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; SENTIMENT SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL AID AT WORK THE LATE WORK IS A PUBLIC INTEREST LEGAL SERVICES OR XIN THAT FOCUSES ON ADVOCATING FOR WORKING AND LOW INCOME WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES- I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TO DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AB EIGHT EIGHTY TWO LEGISLATION WHICH WILL BENEFIT MANY OF THE CLIENTS WE REPRESENT. I'D FIRST LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR HIS LEADERSHIP SURROUNDING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WITH THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AFFECTING THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS PROTECTING THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND RECOVERY PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL DISABILITY RIGHTS HELPLINE AND CLINIC WE HAVE HEARD FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD TO OVERCOME THEIR ADDICTION ONLY TO BE TERMINATED FROM OR DENIED EMPLOYMENT PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A RECOVERY PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH THEY RECEIVE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT OR IN EIGHTY. AND EIGHTY IS AN ADDICTION TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT COMBINES THE USE OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS INCLUDING BIÃ£U PRINT A FRIEND NOW TRACKS OWN IN METHADONE WITH COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IN EIGHTY IS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO RESULT IN SUSTAINED ADDICTION RECOVERY AND AS EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE SURVIVAL RATES OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH OPIOID ADDICTION UNFORTUNATELY MANY EMPLOYERS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE THAT THE MEDICATIONS USED IN ANY T. WILL PREVENT AN EMPLOYEE OR APPLICANT FROM BEING ABLE TO SAFELY PERFORM HIS OR HER JOB. HOWEVER THAT CONCERN IS UNJUSTIFIED RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN TAKEN AS PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS USED IN IN EIGHTY DO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT A PERSON'S INTELLIGENCE MENTAL CAPABILITY PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING OR EMPLOYABILITY NEVER THE LESS DISCRIMINATION PERSISTS AND ACCORDING TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION EMPLOYER DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ME T. PARTICIPATION IT'S EXCUSE ME AND EIGHTY PARTICIPANTS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE RATE OF PARTICIPATION IN THIS LIFESAVING TREATMENT PROGRAM. TO BE CLEAR SUCH. DISCRIMINATION IS ALREADY UNLAWFUL UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL. DISABILITY LAWS. ARE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE SET FORTH IN THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THE- EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT AND CORRESPONDING REGULATIONS. HOWEVER BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN EMPLOYERS CONTINUING TO UNLAWFULLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CALIFORNIA WORKERS TAKING LEGALLY PRESCRIBE MEDITATE MEDICATIONS AS PART OF ANY T. THESE PROTECTIONS MUST BE CLARIFIED THROUGH EXPLICIT INCORPORATION INTO THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE OF THE FIFA. AB EIGHT EIGHT TWO WOULD ACCOMPLISH THIS IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION WHICH IS SO VITAL TO MANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE AT LEAST LATE AT WORK. ONE OF OUR CLIENTS WAS RECENTLY THRILLED WHEN HE WAS CONDITIONALLY OFFERED A JOB THAT WOULD PROVIDE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR HIM AND HIS YOUNG FAMILY HE HAD PERSEVERED THROUGH MANY OBSTACLES IN HIS LIFE. INCLUDING OVERCOMING AN OPIOID ADDICTION AND COMPLETING AN INTENSE VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM ONLY ONE MORE HURDLE STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND THE JOB HE DESIRED A DRUG SCREEN MANDATED BY THE EMPLOYER. A DRUG SCREEN THAT TESTED POSITIVE FOR METHADONE WHICH HE HAD BEEN LEGALLY PRESCRIBED THROUGH HIS IN EIGHTY PROGRAM. THE EMPLOYER WITH DO HIS JOB OFFER BASED ON THE SCREENING DESPITE ITS AWARENESS THAT MY CLIENT WAS NOT USING IT ILLICITLY BUT AS PART OF HIS EFFORT TO OVERCOME PAST ADDICTION. THIS CLAIM IS NOT ALONE HIS STORY IS THE STORY OF SO MANY OTHERS AND RECOVERY- FACE SIMILAR DISCRIMINATION. IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING HELP FOR THEIR ADDICTION NOT FORCING THEM INTO UNEMPLOYMENT. AND THEREFORE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE OF AB EIGHT EIGHT TWO WHICH WILL CLARIFY THAT WORKERS WHO STRUGGLED WITH PAST ADDICTION INCLUDING THOSE PARTICIPATE IN IN IN IN EIGHTY PROGRAM ARE PROTECTED AGAINST DISCRIMINATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MARICA YOSHIHARU WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLACEMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. AGO EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE RACHEL HAS JUST SAID- WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD IN CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND TIMELY ISSUE. AND AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT AS WELL AS THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS ON THESE PROTECTIONS ALREADY EXIST UNDER OUR DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACCOMMODATION LAWS. BUT WE HAVE IS A PATCHWORK OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAW IN VARIOUS REGULATIONS SO I THINK IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO MAKE THESE PROTECTIONS REALLY CLEAR AND EXPLICIT. ON AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WORKERS WHO ARE OVERCOMING ADDICTION WHO ARE NO LONGER USING WHO ARE IN TREATMENT ARE ABLE TO. HAVE THEIR JOBS PROTECTED AND LIVE PRODUCTIVE LIVES SO FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT. RAINY X. CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA BLISSFULLY RIGHTS BELIEVES THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LOSE YOUR JOB. THANK YOU. A LOS IS SUPPORT ANYONE OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IT'S SO NICE TO SEE ALL OF YOU TODAY THANKS SO MUCH- MY NAME FOR CRITICS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE HERE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB EIGHT EIGHT TWO WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE AMENDED LANGUAGE- WITH IN THAT IT SOME OF IT WAS NOTED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF DAY DEFINITION OF A LEGAL DRUG IS NOT DEFINED AND DEFINITION OF ILLEGAL DRUG IN CALIFORNIA IS DIFFERENT THAN THAT AND FEDERAL LAW. SO THAT'S A LARGE CONCERN FOR US ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THE DEALING WHICH WAS ADOPTED BUT LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WERE CONCERNED THAT IT COULD BE INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT AN EMPLOYER IS ONLY ALLOWED TO DRUG TEST IF WITH REGARD TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM NOW WITH REGARD TO OF THE UP ALL THE OTHER ISSUES LAID OUT IN THE EIGHTY A SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AND ALL OF THOSE ISSUES SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT ALL OF THE LANGUAGE FROM THE EIGHTY A WOULD BE ABLE TO BE ACTED OR WE COULD LOOK AT. SOMEHOW I'M JUST REFERENCE TO THAT EIGHTY LANGUAGE ADDITIONALLY WITH THAT- AT THIS POINT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL OF THESE PROTECTIONS ARE ALREADY IN THE LAW WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT TO LOOK AT IT BUT IF IT'S GOING TO- IT TAKE ON THE FEDERAL PROVISIONS IT SHOULD REFLECT THAT EXACTLY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AUTHORS OFFICE AND HIS STAFF ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. A WELLS OPPOSITION. OR IT. HI KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION REPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS WALKER BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA SHEET METAL AIR CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS- OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN UNAMBIGUOUSLY A SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT IN CONSTRUCTION THAT'S OUR BIGGEST DEAL. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT INCREASING LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE MEMBER I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S IN THE LANGUAGE- THIS IS. YEAH I'M LOOKING FOR TO SEE WHAT THE FINAL LANGUAGE IS- OPIOID CRISIS HAS STRUCK THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY HARD. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL ARE WE IN OUR LABOR PARTNERS HAVE MADE THIS A TOP PRIORITY. ON BUT NOTHING TRUMPS A SAKE SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON WE'RE LOOKING TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT- WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO INCREASING AMBIGUITY WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER AND PUBLIC SAFETY THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. I'D LIKE TO ECHO ON THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER- WE CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS ON. OF THE HEALTH AND HEALTHY AND SAFE WORKPLACE MAINTAINING HEALTHY AND SAFE% WORKPLACE FOR WORKERS- WE HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY WORKING WITH A SIMILAR MCCARTY AND HIS STAFF. OF BOUT THE DIRECTION THE BILL'S GOING TO GO ON BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT ACCORDING TO THE FDA- SIDE EFFECTS OF METHADONE INCLUDE LIGHT HEADEDNESS DIZZINESS AND SEDATION. SO HAVING ANYBODY ON A JOB SITE THAT IS EXPERIENCING EITHER SYMPTOMS- CAN BE FATAL NOT ONLY TO THAT WORKER. AND SPECIFICALLY- BUT TO WORKERS- AROUND HIM OR HER IT'S A VERY DYNAMIC VERY ACTIVE PLACE. SO WITH THOSE CONCERNS IN MIND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND STAFF TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FORWARD BECAUSE WE AGREE THE OPIOID CRISIS IS- INSIDIOUS. AN ALL CONSUMING SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. RIGHT WILL BRING ABOUT MISS MCCARTY. AND YEAH AND QUESTIONS. YEAH COMMENTS HIM OKAY I'M AND PROBABLY BOB WANTED A FEW MEMBERS- IN THE ASSEMBLY- AS DIRECTOR OF ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THERE'S ACTUALLY WORK WITH PEOPLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND. BUILDING TRADES CARTER LE CHRISTIANS PLUMBERS DRY WALLER'S- A WHOLE SLEW OF THEM THAT WERE PROCEED LA. AND I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY FIRST HAND WHAT CAN HAPPEN. WHEN SOMEONE'S IMPAIR AND I'VE SEEN THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS OF THAT OF IN SOME WAYS I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE WORKER STANDPOINT MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE IN NOW IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY'RE SAFE. AND SO I WOULD HOPE. THAT AS WE AND- I'M GONNA VOTE TO GET THIS OUT I AM A RESERVE MY BOAT LATER- AS IT MOVES FORWARD- BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE MISTER MCCARTY YOU. GENERALLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS- THAT GET THAT RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS DRUG AND WHAT IT DOES BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE PAIRED- OR TO HAVE EMPLOYEES IMPAIRED. AND THEN TO SEE REALLY TRAGIC ACCIDENT HAPPEN AND SO- THAT IS MY MAIN CONCERN. ABOUT. EVEN JUST DRUG TESTING IF YOU STILL NEED. A YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAD CONSTRUCTION SITES WE STILL NEED TO DO IT EVEN IF SOMEONE WAS OFF. OF A CERTAIN DRUG AND HAD REHABILITATED CONCEIVE LA WE PROBABLY GAVE MORE CHANCES FOR YOU TO REHABILITATE- DILLON PROBABLY THE LAW ALLOWS BUT WE GAVE THOSE CHANCES TO REHABILITATE. BUT ONCE YOU GOT BACK AND YOU START WORKING FOR DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES A PUBLIC WORKS OR IN TRANSPORTATION AND YOU WENT OUT IN THE FIELD YOU START WORKING WITH HEAVY. DUTY MACHINERY IT WAS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- THAT YOU WERE CLEAR HEADED AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND SO- IS MAYBE ONE OF. THE FEW TIMES RIDE COULD KIND OF ECHOING WHAT THE CONCERNS OF THE CHAMBER- AND WHAT BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THIS WORK. THAT YOU WORK TOGETHER HOPEFULLY WITH THEM TO PROVIDE- A WAY THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WHO EVER COMES BACK FROM THIS PROGRAM OR TREATMENT. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK WITH NO HARM TO THEMSELVES AND THEN SOMETIMES TO THEIR CO WORKERS. WHICH IT COULD HAPPEN AND SO- I AND I BELIEVE MISTER MCCARTY YOU YOU TRULY BELIEVE THAT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE WORKER AND SO AT. WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THAT A WITH ALL ENTITIES RIPPER. INVOLVE BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO WORKERS. THANK YOU SENATORS ALSO- FIRST I'M OF THE BILL I AM GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE TIME MEAN I'M BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE THERE'S DISCUSSIONS I'M NINE ASK I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HOUSE WITH- IN PARTICULAR IT. THE BUILDING TRADES AND CONTRACTORS ABOUT. THIS LANGUAGE- TO ENSURE AS AS MISTER JONES SAWYER SAID THAT THERE'S- WE WERE. HAVING SAY PARK SITES WERE HAVING SAY PARKER'S- BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU BECAUSE THIS IS GOES I BELIEVE TO APPROPRIATIONS. WHERE ANTI CRUNCH SO LIKE AFTER THIS HEARING I HOPE YOU GO- I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO THEM BUT LIKE LET'S. GET SOME LANGUAGE ASAP. THANKS. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE THAN A COMMON QUESTION SERRA CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I TO OCCUR THE CONCERNSOF MY COLLEAGUES ON ON THE DÃ­AS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY THE LANGUAGE REGARDING- AN INDIVIDUAL OR THE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY COVERED BY THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THERE ARE WE'RE ALSO FACING A REAL CRISIS WITH MENTAL CHALLNGES ACROSS THE STATE. AND ADDING ADDING TO THAT- I HAVE CONCERNS IN GENERAL HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- AND I HOPE THAT IN THE DAYS IN THE NEXT DAYS TO COME. YOU'LL FIND SOME SOLUTIONS AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE CHAMBER HAS AS WELL AS THE TRAY. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER COMMENT OR QUESTION. HAS IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. SHE SO THE RENT I MADE WAS THAT A MOTION THAT WE USE AS OUR SECOND. OKAY THANK YOU SUMMER JONES SAWYER SIMILAR GONZALEZ REMOVING IT- AND- ALWAYS BRING ABOUT YOUR FINAL COMMENTS ONE MAKE ONE A COUPLE COMMENTS ONE- HAVING WORKED AS YOU KNOW IS PUBLIC DEFENDER OF OVER FIVE AND A HALF YEARS MY TIME WAS A DRUG TREATMENT COURT. TRYING TO. THE ABILITY- MY CLIENTS AND GETTING A JOB WAS ONE OF THE TOP. WAYS IN ADDITION OBVIOUSLY DOING THEIR ADDICTION TREATMENT WHEN HAVE YOU TO GET SOMEONE BACK. ON THEIR FEET BACK AS PART OF SOCIETY AGAIN SO I TRULY- THINK YOU'RE GOAL IS VERY LAUDABLE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT NOW MORE THAN EVER IN REGARDS TO OPIATES CRISIS WITH. SPECIALLY IF WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN MECHANISM MEDICATIONS WHAT HAVE YOU THAT APPROVING AFFECTED THAT WE- IF WE REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REHABILITATE THEM WE SHOULD GIVE THEM. ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE INCLUDING THE TOOL OF BEING ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED. AND THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK THE OPPOSITION ALSO HAS A LOT OF A GOAL OF KEEPING A SAFE WORK SITES I THINK THAT. THAT I APPRECIATE- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DIALOGUE I KNOW EVEN AS RECENT AS YESTERDAY. IN TERMS OF THE. AGREEMENT FROM YOUR SIDE TO. FROM YOU TO. A MAN ALTERS THE LANGUAGE I KNOW THAT- THE I. RECOMMENDATION COMES WITH THAT COMMITMENT FROM YOU AS WELL AS THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT. THAT SPOKE WITH CONCERN TO ENSURE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS AS SUMMER GONZALEZ MOVE THE BILL- INDICATED THAT- ASSURANCES THAT. THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO BE- COULD NOT JUST CONTINUE BUT BE MEANINGFUL- AND- THAT'S MY EXPECTATION AND I THINK THAT'S EXPECTATION OF. THOSE ON THE COMMITTEE AS WELL- IN CONSIDERING THE AND I BOAT ON THIS. SUMMER MCCARTY. YET THANK YOU. BUT THE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT OF COURSE AND LET ME JUST TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES TO REASSURE. GOING FOR TODAY. AND THERE IS A QUITE A FEW THINGS BROUGHT UP BY- COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND IT INDIVIDUALS ME JUST. TRY TO TACKLE A FEW THOSE ONE THERE IS SOME QUESTION IT WAS A REAL SAD ABOUT MARIJUANA. AND HOW THIS MAY LEAVE IT AT THAT I DON'T FULLER BONTA A COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT A PROPOSAL FOR THAT. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SET UP ALL WE ARE- WE ARE FINE CLARIFYING THAT TO TAKE IT OUT TO JUST. BUT INSTEAD OF PRECAUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR. THERE WAS A CONCERT THIS IS ALREADY. AT THIS IS ALREADY REGULATION AND IT'S DUPLICATIVE THAN MIKE. RESPONSES WHAT THE PROBLEM CODIFYING UNDER STATE LAW AND THAT WOULD BE MORE PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THE IRONY IS THAT INDIVIDUALS COULD HAVE CHRONIC PAIN. TAKING AN OPEN EVERY DAY AND GO TO WORK. AND THEN THEY CAN GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY SPIRAL AND GET. DON HEROIN AND START RIPPING OFF THEIR NEIGHBORS NOR COLOR GROUND THOSE PILLS IN THEIR COUNTER AND SO FORTH AND THEN. THEY GET A PROBLEM. TWO YEARS AGO I SAT HERE IN A SEPARATE PANEL AND HOPE WOULD BUILD MY WITNESS. COMMERCIAL PAINTER HIS NAME WAS STEVE. AND HE SAID THAT HE BECAME ADDICTED. TO PAIN. KILLERS AND HE WAS CASE IN IT HI UP TIME THE GUY. LIKE IT'S KIND OF A C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AS I HIGH.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN THIS NEW DRUG THIS AND MAKE TEA. BEEPING AFFERENTS A BOX ON WHAT THE OTHER ONE THAT. NO TRACKS IN. A SHOW THAT HAS LOWER LEVELS AND THE INDIVIDUALS. DON'T GET HOT IT'S THE THING THAT THAT THE GUY WANTED TO DO EVERYDAY AS WAKE UP AND BE FUNCTIONING. GO TO WORK AND THE INDIVIDUAL. WORK FOR A COMMERCIAL PAINTER IT WAS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER HE'S HE HE HE A SHELL LIKE MANY PEOPLE MINISTRY OF THIS. NOT IS IN THE SAY IT'S A WONDER DRUG BUT IT'S ONE OF THE- GREAT TREAT PROMISING TREATMENTS WE HAVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET BACK. INTO SOCIETY GET BACK TO WORK AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT SO I THINK THAT THERE. IS A SWEET SPOT THAT WE CAN WORK OUT WITH WITH THE- THE KID THE OPPOSITION AND THAT CONCERN OURS. NOT REALLY WORK CONCERNS BUT I'M- AND THEN THAT'S OF COURSE WITH THE- THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- THIS IS NOW I THINK THAT THE DEGREE NOT ONLY OF THE OPIOID CRISIS WHICH IS BEEN- TAKEN MANY YEARS TO GET US WHERE WE ARE BUT- THESE NEW TREATMENTS AND I THINK THAT- EMPLOYERS- THAT IS A SUMMARY JONES SAWYER SAID HAVING. WORKED IN THAT ARENA- THEIR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS SAFETY AND SOMETHING IF YOU'RE INTRODUCING SOMETHING NEW- TO A WORK SITE WHETHER TO MEDICATION OR TREATMENT WHAT HAVE YOU- IT'S A COMMON UPON THEM. DID TO DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A SAFER EXCITE. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE DIALOGUE AS TO WHAT THESE TREATMENTS ARE WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE PURPOSES. AND FINDING WAYS TO NARROW. THE FOCUS OF THE BILL AS MUCH AND IT ALREADY HAS AS YOU INDICATED- YOUR YOUR INTEREST IN CLARIFYING IT BROTHER DOES THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE AYE AYES WHENEVER YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING NEW ESPECIALLY IN WHEN THEY CUT DEALS WITH. SOMETHING SO SIGNIFICANT AS. OPIATE ADDICTION. AND WORK. IF THE. TWO ISSUES THAT. DON'T WANT TO. RISE UP THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE. EDUCATION DIALOGUE. AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS. A IN THE MIND TO BE HAD I THINK IT'S A PRETTY NARROW. NEEDLE TO THREATEN BUT I THINK CAN BE DONE AND I HOPE YOU CAN GET THERE AND THAT'S WHY. I SUPPORT THAT MOVED TO STOP FOR A GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY. I AM A NDA THE ALSO. OKAY ABOUT THAT AMOUNT OF SECTOR IF WE CAN. CALL THE CALL THE ROLL ON THE BOAT. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA AYE KALRA AYE FLORA FLORA NO CREO
