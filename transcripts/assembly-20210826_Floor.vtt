DENSITY INCREASES IN ALREADY

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:18.593
DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS BUT

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.529
EXAMS THE STORE DISTRICTS. THIS

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:21.963

WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE I WANT

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:33.341

SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:48.557
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPERS

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:50.959
COMING IN TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.627
AND CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:55.197
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD CITIES WILL

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.765
HAVE LOCAL CONTROL IN THE

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:57.999
AUTHORITY TO DENY A PROPOSED

01:18:58.066 --> 01:18:59.234
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT THE

HOUSING DEVELOPMENT POSES A

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:02.304
RISK TO PUBLIC HEALTH. OR

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:05.240
SAFETY RECENT AMENDMENTS ALSO

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:06.842
REQUIRE THAT THE OWNER OF THE

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.243
RITUAL LOT SIGN AN AFFIDAVIT

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:10.112

SPLIT FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.952
ALSO NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.487
PRECLUDES LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:21.156
CHARGING IMPACT FEES FOR NEW

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.357

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.392
PROJECT UNDER SB NINE TO

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:25.760
DECREASED IMPACT ON

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:28.096
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:32.801
REASONS I SUPPORT SB. NINE.

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:34.469

MUST ARISE IN OPPOSITION OF SB

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.515
NINE. SB NINE CAN BE CALLED

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.617
COMMUNITY PLANNING CHAOS

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:49.851
BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.753
RETROACTIVELY FOR COMMUNITIES

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.955
LIKE THE ONES I REPRESENT THAT

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:55.857
ARE LESS THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.826
WHAT IT DOES IS IT IT MAKES ALL

01:19:57.893 --> 01:19:59.427
OF THE PLANNING ALL THE MASTER

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.363
PLANNING ALL THE SEAT WAS.

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.532
ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALS THAT

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.200
WENT INTO MAKING THOSE

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:08.303
COMMUNITIES- ENABLING THEM TO

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.171
HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:11.106
TODAY. IT LAYS TO WASTE

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:12.574
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.809
BEEN SPENT DOING THAT. IT ALSO

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.112
WILL AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:17.913
AS THEY HAVE TO TAKE INTO

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:20.348
ACCOUNT. THE DOUBLING OF THE

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:22.184
POPULATION THAT IS JUST THE

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:26.154
POTENTIAL FOR HAVING TO. TWO

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.790
HOUSES ON ONE LOT FOR ALL OF

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:29.591
THESE SINGLE FAMILY

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.593
DEVELOPMENT. WHICH MEANS IT

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.229
WILL IMPACT THE APPROVALS OF

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:37.132
FUTURE HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:41.203
FUTURE COMMERCIAL PROJECT IT

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:43.271
LAYS TO WASTE OUR EFFORTS TO

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:44.706
HAVE APPROVED TO TRAFFIC

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:46.942

EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS IN

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:56.117
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS AS I'VE

01:20:56.184 --> 01:21:00.222
STATED BEFORE. THIS TAKES MANY

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.524
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LESS THAN

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.192
THIRTY YEARS OLD OUT OF

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.460
COMPLIANCE WITH THE VERY

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.896
REGULATIONS THAT WE CREATED

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:10.365
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:12.434
JUST GONNA PUSH THAT ASIDE PUSH

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.969
AWAY THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:15.237
THAT WE HAVE FORCE THOSE

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.372
COMMUNITIES TO SPAN INSTEAD OF

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.541
BUILDING BUILDING OUT THEIR

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:20.375
STREETS AND BUILDING OUT THESE

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:22.377
OTHER THINGS. THEY FORCED THEM

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.712
TO SPEND A MONTH PLANS THAT WE

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:25.647
CREATED WE'RE GONNA THROW THOSE

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:26.915
ASIDE AND TELL THESE

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.917
COMMUNITIES YOU HAVE TO CHANGE

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:29.584
THE CHARACTER OF YOUR

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:32.153
COMMUNITY. SO THAT WE CAN SOLVE

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.623
A PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT GOING TO

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.691
BE SOLVED BY THIS WE HAVE TO

01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:38.660
ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.563
OF WHY WE CAN'T BUILD HOUSES IN

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:43.765
CALIFORNIA. WHY WE CAN'T BRING

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:47.802
IN BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:49.604
THAT THOSE UNDERLYING CAUSES

01:21:49.671 --> 01:21:52.374
HAVE TO DO WITH OUR

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.542
REQUIREMENTS OUR REGULATIONS IF

01:21:54.609 --> 01:21:56.311
WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.046
THINGS LIKE THIS ARE JUST

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.315
BANDAIDS THAT WON'T WORK SO FOR

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:03.351

ALL ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:37.685
BILL FROM BOTH SIDES HOW WE CAN

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:40.154
ONLY RESULT IN A MAXIMUM OF

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:40.722
FOUR UNITS ON A LOT THAT WAS

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:43.891
SPLIT HOW IT PROTECTS AGAINST

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:46.194
DISPLACEMENT AND SPECULATION.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.895
HOW CITIES RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.130
THROUGH OBJECTIVE PLANNING

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:51.099
STANDARDS LIKE BUILDING HEIGHT

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.968
SETBACKS AND LOT COVERAGE.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.803
YOU'VE SEEN A RIGOROUS ACADEMIC

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.339
ANALYSIS FROM UC BERKELEY WHICH

01:27:58.406 --> 01:27:59.207
FOUND THAT THIS BILL WOULD

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:01.309
CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.511
DEVELOPMENT. ON AROUND ONE

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:04.278
HUNDRED AND TEN PART THOUSAND

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:05.880
PARCELS. THAT'S A GREAT

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:08.116
OUTCOME. BUT ONE THE ONLY

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:11.119
REPRESENTS ONE POINT 5% OF

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:13.187
SINGLE FAMILY PARCELS STATEWIDE

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:14.889
HARDLY THE ELIMINATION OF

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.058
SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. WHAT I

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.093
WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER TODAY

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.828
IS NOT JUST WHAT THIS BILL

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:23.898
DOES. BUT WHY WE ARE DOING IT

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:25.266
WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING FOR

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.435
HOUSING SAKE WE DON'T BUILD

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.836
HOUSING TO MEET OUR READING THE

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.171
NUMBERS WERE DISSATISFIED

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:32.473
DEVELOPERS OR ADVOCATES OR EVEN

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.308
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE BUILD

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.878
HOUSING FOR MORE BASIC REASONS

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.880
FAMILY COMMUNITY AN

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:41.149
OPPORTUNITY. THE CHANCE TO GROW

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:43.451
YOUR NEST EGG THE CHANCE TO AGE

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:45.653
WITH DIGNITY IN YOUR HOME THE

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.055
CHANCE TO HAVE YOUR CHILDREN

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.856
AND GRAND CHILDREN GROW UP IN

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:50.591
THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT YOU

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:53.494
DID THESE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.396
A COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY. TO

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:56.431
THOSE WORRIED ABOUT THE

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.700
CHARACTER OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:28:58.766 --> 01:28:59.300
THINK ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.369
YOU GREW UP IN THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:02.937
IT MEANT TO RIDE YOUR BIKE TO

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.872
YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE. TO GO SEE

01:29:04.939 --> 01:29:06.741
GRANDMA TO WALK TO SCHOOL WITH

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.376
YOUR CLASSMATES. THESE

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:11.212
EXPERIENCES ARE THE FOUNDATION

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:13.147
OF CIVIC IDENTITY AND WE ARE

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.116
DENYING AN ENTIRE GENERATION

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.719
ACCESS TO THEM WE DENIED THEM.

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:20.154
AT OUR PERIL DO YOU WONDER WHY

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:22.724
OUR POLITICS SO DIVISIVE WHY

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:25.159
ARE EMPATHY IS SO LOW. THERE IS

01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:26.861
A REASON THEY SAY THAT CHARITY

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:29.163
STARTS AT THE HOME. BUT IT'S

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.898
PRETTY HARD TO FEEL TERRIBLE

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:32.166
WHEN YOU'RE PAYING OVER HALF

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:34.335
YOUR INCOME TO RENT. LIKE MORE

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:36.504
THAN ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS IN

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:38.973
CALIFORNIA. WE BUILD HOUSING

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.709
BECAUSE HOUSING GROSS

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.411
COMMUNITIES DID YOU KNOW THAT

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.913
READ READ THREE REDWOOD TREES.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.149
AS MASSIVE AS THEY ARE HAVE

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.418
VERY SHALLOW ROOTS. DESPITE THE

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:51.385
FACT THE BIG ROAD TO BE

01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:53.221
HUNDREDS OF YEARS HUNDREDS OF

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:54.856
FEET HIGH AND LIVE FOR

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.958
THOUSANDS OF YEARS. THE ROOT

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:59.794
SYSTEMS ONLY GO DOWN TEN OR

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.395
FIFTEEN FEET. THEIR STRENGTHS

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.131
AND THEIR LONGEVITY COMES NOT

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:05.166
FROM DEATH BUT BECAUSE THE

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:06.901
INTERTWINED THEIR ROOTS IN A

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.736
NETWORK WITH OF THE REDWOODS.

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:11.105
THE TREES LITERALLY HOLD EACH

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.241
OTHER UP WITH THIS STRATEGY OF

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:15.009
MUTUAL SUPPORT. THEY CAN

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:17.211
WITHSTAND FLOODS MASSIVE FIRES

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.147
DROUGHT WIND AND YES EVEN

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:20.948
EARTHQUAKES. AND IT'S NO

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:25.119
pCHALLENGES WE FACE IN OUR STATE

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.888
REQUIRE A SIMILAR SURVIVAL

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:29.357
STRATEGY. FAR FROM WEAKENING

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.159
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THIS BILL

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.261
WILL MAKE THEM STRONGER MORE

01:30:33.327 --> 01:30:35.429
RESILIENT MORE INCLUSIVE. THIS

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:37.498
CAN ONLY BE A GOOD THING FOR

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:38.933
CALIFORNIA AND FOR THESE

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.670
REASONS I RESPECTFULLY

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:43.304
ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS

HOMEWORK OWNERSHIP BUT ALL OF

THEM ARE TOOLS THAT GIVE THE

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.640
HOME OWNER THE OPPORTUNITY TO

A SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNER WOULD

NEED TO SPLIT THEIR LOT OR

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:46.020

INSTANTLY MOVED INTO A CLASS

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.712
THAT IS A SMALL CLASS AND THAT

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.748
IS THE CLASS OF OWNING A HOME.

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.683
BECAUSE YOU OWN A HOME YOU WERE

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.218
PACKING YOUR BAGS AND MOVING

DREAM THAT CALIFORNIA DREAM

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.549
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO

YOUNGER WE ARE GIVING UP THE

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:09.490
IDEA OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IT

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:10.558
IS MUCH MORE ATTAINABLE TO

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:11.659
ATTAIN A HOMEOWNERSHIP DREAM

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:13.127
PERHAPS IN RURAL AREAS OF

CALIFORNIA OR OTHER STATES

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.763
ENTIRELY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:16.830
SEEING DECLINING ENROLLMENTS

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.232
ESPECIALLY EVEN IN MY DISTRICT

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.366
WHERE WE'RE NOT HAVING KIDS

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:20.968

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.436
OF YOUNG STUDENTS TO KEEP OUR

IS WE'LL DRIVE EVERYONE AWAY

01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:29.176
THE TALENT THAT WE HAVE

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.611
CULTIVATED THAT WE HAVE GROWN

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:32.346
IN CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE AWAY TO

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.148
OTHER STATES AND THAT IS A

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:35.115
FORTY SOMETHING THAT IS ALWAYS

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:36.350
ON THE TOP OF MY TO MANY

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:38.819
PEOPLE. AND I THINK ABOUT SB

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:39.520
NINE IS BEING SOMETHING VERY

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:40.621
EMPOWERING TO A LOT OF FAMILIES

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:42.623
IN MY DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.358
FOUR GENERATIONS OF IMMIGRANT

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:45.559
FAMILIES LIVING UNDER ONE

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:47.595
SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE AND THAT IS

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:49.496
NOT A PRACTICAL NECESSITY. IS

01:37:49.563 --> 01:37:51.298
NOT OUT OF COMFORT IT'S NOT

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:53.234
HELD OF THE DESIRE TO BE REALLY

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.335
CLOSE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:55.703
ALTHOUGH I'M SOME I'M SURE MANY

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:56.503
FAMILIES LOVE EACH OTHER THAT

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:59.139
CLOSELY. IT IS NOT THAT DESIRE

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:00.541
THAT IS THE PRACTICAL REALITY

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:01.775
OF MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.244
THE WEALTHY SILICON VALLEY IN

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:04.612
THE BAY AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:06.313
MAKING IN THE SIX FIGURES BUT

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.249
STILL CANNOT ATTAIN ANY SORT OF

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:10.017
HOMEOWNERSHIP OR SPACE THEY

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.485
NEED TO LIVE IN I'M NOT SHY

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:12.553
ABOUT TELLING THIS THE FOLKS

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.220
THAT I STILL LIVE WITH MY

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:15.089
FAMILY. AT HOME IT'S THE ONLY

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.257
WAY TO PRACTICALLY LIVE IN OUR

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:17.858
AREA WHERE MOST PEOPLE WILL

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.526
NEVER BE ABLE TO DREAM OF

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:20.828
HOMEOWNERSHIP I WAS TALKING TO

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:21.762
A COLLEAGUE OF MY FROM ANOTHER

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:23.230
STATE OR TALK ABOUT THE CONCEPT

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:25.232
OF STARTER HOME AND NOT FORCED

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.534
I FORGOT. WHAT THAT CONCEPT

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.403
EVEN IS FOR MOST OF OUR

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:31.305
GENERATION A WE JUST ATTAIN

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:33.073
HOMEOWNERSHIP AT ALL I KNOW IN

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:34.141
PREVIOUS GENERATIONS THERE'S

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.442
IDEA OF LEVELING UP IN HOMES

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:36.644
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WE DON'T EVEN

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:39.246
THINK ABOUT THAT ALL. B. EVERY

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:40.814
YEAR THAT WE DO NOT ACT ON THIS

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:42.182
HOUSING CRISIS AND OF COURSE SB

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:46.620
AS KNOWLEDGE IT IS A STEP IN

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:47.354
THE DIRECTION WE NEED ME MORE

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.289
AND MORE GENERATIONS OF

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:49.623
CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE HOPE IN

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.091
CALIFORNIA. AND I DON'T WANT TO

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:52.293
SEE MORE OF OUR FAMILIES MOVE

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:54.261
AWAY MORE FAMILIES BEING PRICED

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.029

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.463

WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:38.906
SOLUTIONS BUT THE REALITY IS

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:45.279
THAT WHEN. SEVENTY SIX POINT 2%

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:46.447

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:50.084

AND OVER. HOMEOWNERS RELY ON

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:58.258
THAT SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTY

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.728
THAT THEY ARE LIVING IN AS

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:05.432
THEIR PRIMARY INVESTMENT. WE'RE

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:07.201
GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THAT

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:10.704
INVESTMENT. I'M JUST BASING

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.973
THIS ON NUMBERS I'M BASING IT

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.742
ON WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE

01:40:14.808 --> 01:40:16.543
HEADED WE'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:19.580
THIS BEFORE THERE'S GONNA BE A

01:40:19.646 --> 01:40:22.383
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AND IT'S

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:24.818
GOING TO BE DEVASTATING TO THE

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.888
VERY PEOPLE WHO WE NEED TO

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.857
PROTECT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:40:29.923 --> 01:40:32.893
INCOME COMING IN. IT MIGHT WORK

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.298
FOR THE FIRST FIVE TEN YEARS.

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:39.633
IT MIGHT ALLOW SOME OF THEM TO

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.201
BE ABLE TO SELL OUT AND MOVE IT

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:44.371
MOVE AWAY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.774
DEVASTATING FOR ANYBODY ELSE

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.375
THAT'S IN THAT AGE RANGE.

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:50.010
THAT'S GONNA NEED TO HOLD ON TO

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:53.046
THE HOUSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.648
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO AFTER THEY

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:57.618
SELL THE HOUSE. PLEASE THINK

01:40:57.684 --> 01:40:59.720

SO FROM 11% TO FOURTEEN. AND IN

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:22.276
THE NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS

01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:24.244
IT'S GONNA GO UP 225% WE'RE

01:41:24.311 --> 01:41:26.513
GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THIS

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:30.884
VERY TRUNCHEON OF INDIVIDUALS

01:41:30.951 --> 01:41:34.221
WHO ARE RELYING ON THEIR HOMES

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:37.825
TO BE THEIR NEST EGGS. AND WE

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:39.493

HIS HOUSE I AM THAT GENERATION

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:50.337
WHO'S TRYING TO DEVELOP THE

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:52.139
GENERATIONAL WEALTH AFTER WE

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:54.374
LOST EVERYTHING IN A WAR FORTY

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:55.776
YEARS AGO WHEN WE IMMIGRATED TO

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.211
THE UNITED STATES I UNDERSTAND

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.279
WITH GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:03.450
ITS LOSS MEANS AND I'M TRYING

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.017
TO BUILD IT RIGHT NOW FOR MY

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:08.222
KIDS THIS ISN'T GOING TO HELP

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:12.059
THIS WORKS COUNTER TO THAT.

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:15.162
SHORT TERM IT'LL WORK LONG TERM

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:18.632
IT'LL BE DEVASTATING. WE TALK

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.033
ABOUT DISTRICTS THAT ARE LARGE

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.003
ENOUGH TO ABSORB THIS MIGHT THE

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.238
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I HAVE THE

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:27.407
HONOR OF REPRESENTING DISTRICT

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:28.809
FORTY SIX. IN COMPARISON TO MY

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.943
GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:32.012
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE EITHER

OF MY TWO GOOD COLLEAGUES FROM

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.615
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHETHER

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:39.586
SIZE FINGERNAIL COMPARED TO

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.188
WHAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE

01:42:41.255 --> 01:42:44.358
BECAUSE WE ARE DENSE. WHICH

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.326
MEANS THAT THE DENSITY IS GONNA

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.161
BE MISHANDLED WHEN THE SINGLE

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:51.265
FAMILY HOMES ARE SUBDIVIDED.

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.300
IT'S ONE THING TO BUILD UP IT'S

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.902
ANOTHER THING TO CONTINUE THE

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:59.740
SPRAWL IN DISTRICTS LIKE MINE.

01:42:59.806 --> 01:43:03.343

BECAME AND I AND THOSE CONCERNS

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:51.985
WERE GENTRIFICATION DENSITY AND

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:54.855
WHEN I CALL PRICES SEGREGATION

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:57.257
ANY AUTHORED GREED WITH ME THAT

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.192

UNCONSTITUTIONAL SEGREGATION

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:08.168
GENTRIFICATION AND WEALTH

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:10.904
STAGNATION THAT. THAT WILL

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:13.106
PERPETUATE KEEPING PEOPLE OF

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:17.944
COLOR DOWN BECAUSE THIS HOUSING

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:20.514
IS THE PRINCIPLE GAP BETWEEN

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.349
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONSIDERED

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:24.651
DISADVANTAGED AND POOR PEOPLE

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:26.720
WHO ARE WEALTHY AND SHE'S

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:29.089
AGREED TO WORK WITH ME AS WE

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:31.858
COME UP WITH OUR OWN PLAN. FOR

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:34.494
HOW WE DEAL WITH THOSE THREE

01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:37.698
THINGS BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.433
WHERE MOST OF THE LAND BECAUSE

01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:42.736
OF THE HOUSING DROP WE HAD THAT

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:46.406
CRISIS MOSTLY LAND IS OWNED BY

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:48.575
CORPORATIONS AND SO

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:51.611
GENTRIFICATION IS REAL SOUTH LA

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:57.350
BEING WHITE AGAIN IS VERY REAL.

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:00.620
DENSITY YOU CAN'T PUT MORE

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:02.756
DANCE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SEE

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.925
MORE DENSER AREA THAN MINE AND

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:07.594
SHE AGREED WITH ME WE NEED TO

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:10.897
LOOK AT THAT IN A WAY THAT. ALL

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:12.566
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:14.901
THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO MOVE

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:16.636
INTO OTHER AREAS WOULD HAVE

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:19.673
MORE ROOM THAT YOU DON'T END UP

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:23.210
IN THE SAME AREA AND THEN WHEN

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:26.546
I CALL PRICE SEGREGATION.

01:46:26.613 --> 01:46:28.749
THAT'S A GREAT WAY FOR KEEPING

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:30.951
PEOPLE OF COLOR OUT OF CERTAIN

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:34.287
AREAS BY NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:36.189
MOVE HERE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:38.492
AFFORD TO COME HERE AND THEN
