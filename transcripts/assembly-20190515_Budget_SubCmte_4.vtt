00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:21.532
POINT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.668
WHICH IS THAT MORE MANY OF THE

00:33:23.735 --> 00:33:30.007
BROAD POLICY -- IDEAS OF THIS

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.175
ADMINISTRATION UP.

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:32.543
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.213
GOOD JOBS THAT IN THE COMMUNITY

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.648
THE MOST AND SO -- ADDRESSING

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.484
CLIMATE ADDRESSING THE HOUSING

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.551
SHORTAGE ADDRESSING

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:41.586
INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:42.820
TRANSPORTATION AND CLEAN WATER

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:45.590
ACCESS ALL OF THESE ARE NOT

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:47.091
POLICIES THAT EXIST IN A VACUUM

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:49.460
THEY ARE OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:50.995
THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS.

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:53.398
AND ENSURE MORE EQUITY AND A BIG

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.966
PART OF THAT IS WHAT WILL THE

00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:56.734
JOBS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM

00:33:56.801 --> 00:33:59.303
THOSE -- THOSE EFFORTS LOOK LIKE

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.705
AND THAT IS WITHIN THE VERY

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:01.939
DEFINITION OF THE FUTURE OF WORK

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.809
UP SO THE IDEA OF WHAT THE

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.945
PORTABLE BENEFITS RIGHT THE IDEA --

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:12.116
OF OF OF SCHEDULING AND

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.118
WORKPLACE FLEXIBILITY ALL OF

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.355
THOSE ARE WITH IN THE REALM OF

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:20.158
FUTURE OF WORK AND OUR GOAL IS

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.426
TO BRING TOGETHER.

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:22.627
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS PEOPLE

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.629
REPRESENT EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:26.397
TECH COMPANIES INNOVATORS

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:28.699
DISRUPTORS VENTURE CAPITALISTS

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.435
ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS TO

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.437
TACKLE ALL OF THESE UP ALL OF

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:33.404
THESE ISSUES.

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:35.006
RIGHT WHAT CM DO A TIME FRAME

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:35.606
FOR WHEN THE REPORT MIGHT BE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.476
FINISHED SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:44.382
OF INCLUDES A FEBRUARY TWENTY

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:46.551
TWENTY PROGRESS REPORT -- I

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:47.118
BELIEVE THAT THE WORK OF THE

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:47.785
COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE BEYOND

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:48.920
THAT AND WE'RE CURRENTLY

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:51.322
PLANNING FOR AT LEAST ABOUT A

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.125
YEAR -- OF OF OF WORK AND THEN

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:57.662
ANOTHER YEAR OF TRYING TO FIGURE

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.597
OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA ROLL OUT --

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:02.233
AND ENGAGE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.701
THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION AND

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:04.836
THEN ONE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE --

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:07.238
AREA -- YOU MENTIONED INCOME

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.372
INEQUALITY AND I THINK WE ALL

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:09.674
KNOW THAT TECHNOLOGY IS

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.909
CONCENTRATING WEALTH AND MAKING

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.044
INCOME INEQUALITY FORMER

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.846
EXACERBATED ARE YOU GONNA THINK

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:16.781
ABOUT TAX POLICIES OR OTHER.

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.249
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT FOR THE

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:19.350
ECONOMY THAT COME OUT OF THE

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:22.119
FACT THAT THE WORK FORCE HAS

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:22.353
CHANGED.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.387
SO RIGHT NOW.

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:25.389
THERE ARE MANY POSSIBILITIES AS

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.625
TO WHAT THE WHAT THE POLICIES OF

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:28.659
THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL COME

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.161
FROM THE COMMISSION ARE AT

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:31.529
ADDRESSING THAT FUNDAMENTAL

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:34.899
QUESTION OF OF POVERTY JOB

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.201
QUALITY AND HOW INNOVATION

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:38.636
AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.238
ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:40.771
NOT.

00:35:40.838 --> 00:35:42.240
JUST WORKERS BUT ALL PEOPLE

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.908
CALIFORNIA IS A KEY PART OF THAT

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.644
SO WE'RE GONNA BE OPEN -- TO TO

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.412
ALL IT TOOK TO LOOK ALL KINDS OF

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:49.347
THINGS THAT THAT ARE GENERATED

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:50.448
BY THE CONVERSATION BY THE

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:51.549
COMMISSION MEMBERS.

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.251
AND ALSO LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.753
WITH YOU ALL AS OF LEGISLATORS

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.555
ON ON ON ON WHAT THOSE

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:58.689
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND WHAT

00:35:58.756 --> 00:35:59.790
THEY COULD LOOK LIKE GREAT

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:01.559
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:02.159
PARTICULAR REPRESENTING A CITY

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:02.793
THAT.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.195
REPRESENTS THAT TECHNOLOGY

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:05.897
INNOVATION BUT ALSO VERY MUCH AS

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:07.298
STOOD WITH WORKERS WE SORT OF

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.733
REPRESENT THAT DICHOTOMY --

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:09.934
THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT WE ARE

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.704
GRAPPLING WITH AND LOOK FOR TO

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:15.806
YOU THOMAS THE ANSWERS.

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:16.974
Q. SEVEN THANK YOU JUST IRVINE

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.142
AUTOMATION PART A LITTLE BIT --

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.911
OBVIOUSLY AUTOMATION OF A LOT AG

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:20.578
IN MY DISTRICTS LOSING MORE MORE

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.246
AUTOMATION'S BECAUSE THE COST OF

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:23.180
LABOR.

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.549
AND AND HOW DEEP YOU CAN GO INTO

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.083
THAT BESIDES LABOR PART BECAUSE

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.420
SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH --

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.756
SOME LOST CLIMATE CHANGE -- WE

00:36:31.822 --> 00:36:32.657
DO A LOT IN CALIFORNIA HERE.

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:34.792
THAT.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.494
IS NOT DONE ELSEWHERE SO YOU

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:37.995
LOOK AT OUR FOLKS ARE INVOLVED

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:39.664
IN THE AG INDUSTRY.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.198
OTHER FEES ARE A LOT MORE HIGHER

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:43.100
NOT BECAUSE OF LABOR BECAUSE

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.835
WHETHER IT'S IT'S PESTICIDES OR

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.804
FARM EQUIPMENT IMPLEMENTS SO HOW

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.839
HOW DEEPLY GO TO THE AUTOMATION

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:50.274
PIECE.

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:53.844
SO MY HOPE IS -- AND THE PLAN IS

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:56.447
TO ACTUALLY GO DEEPLY A KNIFE TO

00:36:56.514 --> 00:36:57.582
COME UP WITH MEANINGFUL

00:36:57.648 --> 00:37:00.084
PROPOSALS THAT THEN WE ARE ABLE

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.086
TO ACTUALLY TURN INTO REALITY

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:03.087
IMPLEMENT IN THE STATE OF

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:03.955
CALIFORNIA.

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:06.090
OF THE THESE THESE ARE NOT NEW

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:07.391
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR NOT

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:08.726
QUESTIONS THAT WERE ONLY ASKING

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.595
CALIFORNIA BUT I DO THINK THAT

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.964
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF OUR STATE.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.599
BECAUSE OF THE TALENT POOL

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.499
BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT OF

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.667
EMPLOYERS.

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.536
WHO ARE BOTH OF THE CUTTING EDGE

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:20.605
OF TECHNOLOGY AND IT AND

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.006
UNDERSTAND THAT THE -- STRONG

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.774
WORKPLACE STANDARDS ARE GOOD FOR

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.543
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.377
THINGS I THINK THAT WE HAVE A

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.311
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY ASK

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.480
CALIFORNIA TO REALLY DIVE IN

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:31.015
MORE DEEPLY AND NOT JUST QUIT

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.116
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN TALK

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.452
ABOUT BUT THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:35.753
DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY REALLY WORK.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.587
SO I I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.255
BUTFOR INSTANCE IFFOR FOR

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:39.390
FRUIT AND CITRUS IT'S A

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:40.791
WORLDWIDE MARKET WOULD DEAL WITH

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.326
A LOT OF CITRUS CONFIRMATION.

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.295
OBVIOUSLY THE COST OF OF DOING

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.796
BUSINESS IN ASIA IS MUCH CHEAPER.

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.064
NOT JUST LABOR I'M TALKING ABOUT

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.733
EVERYTHING ELSE THE RULES AND

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:50.201
REGULATIONS OF A I MEAN JUST TO

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.203
REALLY GET A TO DO A DEEP DIVE

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:53.137
ON THAT AND REALLY LOOK AT THAT

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:53.971
AND THE SAME THING WITH

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.840
STRAWBERRIES WE SEE A LOT OF

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:57.008
STRAWBERRIES.

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.109
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH ARE

00:37:58.175 --> 00:37:58.909
PRESENT PLUS DRIVERS GOING HERE

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:01.545
BUT ALSO A LOT GOING TO MEXICO

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:06.283
SO THAT THE COSTS ARE MUCH

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.685
DIFFERENT BUT YET.

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.452
IT'S IT'S STILL WE'RE STILL

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:09.820
DOING THE SAME ANIMAL SO I MEAN

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:10.421
I WOULD HOPE THAT DIE WOULD BE

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.055
VERY DEEP AND REALLY BECAUSE NO

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.156
ONE YET HAS YET REALLY EXPORTED.

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.124
AND WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT ISSUES

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.958
ARE.

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.159
SO THE ANSWER IS YES WE WANT

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:17.428
EXPLORE THOSE AND THAT INDUSTRY --

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.063
IN PARTICULAR IS ONE THAT WE

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.698
TALKED ABOUT AS OF WILL SITTING

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:22.066
AT THE CROSSROADS OF MANY OF THE

00:38:22.133 --> 00:38:23.200
THINGS THAT THAT THAT YOU ASKED

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.735
ABOUT IN THAT THAT ARE DISCUSSED

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:25.636
IN OUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU.

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:27.038
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA PAUSE

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.239
BECAUSE WE HAVE MISTER LACKEY

THAT WE DO IS SOME OF THE A

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.114
SUBSET OF THOSE CASES.

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.216
BASED UPON OF THE LIMITATIONS OF

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.718
OUR STAFFING AND THE PRIORITIES

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:22.653

CASES WE TAKE ON FOR

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:25.222
INVESTIGATION.

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:27.157
AS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING THOSE

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:28.859
CASES TO GROUP BE PURSUED BY THE

THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S.

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.331
AND THEN THERE IS A THIRD OF A

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.732
CATEGORY OF WORK THAT WE DO

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:38.035
WHICH IS THAT WE REVIEW PROPOSED

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.203

THE COURT FOR SETTLEMENT

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.482
AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS REQUIRED

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:52.950
BY THE ACT.

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.885
IN THOSE SITUATIONS OR WE LOOK

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.688
AT THOSE TO GET SOME IDEA OF

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.690
WHETHER ONE THE PENALTIES ARE

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:01.859
BEING PAID TO THE STATE UNDER

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:04.328
THE AGREEMENT -- APPEAR TO BE.

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.530
ALL SUFFICIENT AND SECONDLY ALL

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.132
WHETHER THE WORKERS WHO WERE

00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:09.666
AFFECTED BY THE VIOLATIONS ARE

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:12.769
BEING APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED.

00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:15.439
ON END IN THAT OTHER SAUCE.

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.607
OF POLICIES ARE ARE BEING

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.876
ENFORCED BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.811
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WHEN

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.079
THEY PURSUE THESE MATTERS IN

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:24.248
COURT ART AFFECT STEPPING INTO

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:25.749
THE SHOES OF THE STATE.

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:29.219
AND SO ALL THE UNIT WAS SET FOR

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.754
TWO LAW TO TO MONITOR THOSE

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:32.256
THINGS AND AND TO FIND OUT WHAT

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:33.790
WAS GOING ON IN TO PURSUE

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:34.925
CERTAIN CASES.

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:41.698
OF GRIEF WE THINK THAT THE UNIT

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:44.234
HAS BEEN SIX THIS WILL IN DOING

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.869
THAT -- THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:47.271
LARGE CASES OR WHICH THE UNIT

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.705
PICKED UP OFF FOR INVESTIGATION

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:51.475
AND HAS PER AND IS PURSUED ALL

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.010
OF THOSE CASES ON THEIR VARIETY

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:53.377
OF REASONS WHY.

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:54.111
ARE WE THINK THAT THE STATE

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:54.845
INTERVENTION IN THOSE CASES HAS

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.314
BEEN ALL IMPORTANT. TO THE

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:58.882
OVERALL ENFORCEMENT.

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.284
ON THERE SOME THINGS THAT WEEK

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:04.521
IS A STATE AGENCY ARE ABLE -- TO

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.489
TO TO ENFORCE THE LAW WHICH

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.391
PRIVATE PARTIES ARE NOT ABLE TO

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.293
DO SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.627
THINK IS REALLY NOTABLE.

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:12.663
IS THAT THERE ARE CASES WHERE

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:15.032
THE SITUATIONS WITH VERY SEVERE

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.301
VIOLATIONS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:18.468
ABLE TO TAKE THE STEP OF

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:19.903
COORDINATING WITH LAW

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.772
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ACTUALLY

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.307
GETTING PROSECUTION OF THOSE

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:24.374
CASES.

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:25.309
AND WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE CASES

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:27.077
ALL THAT'S ALREADY GONE THROUGH

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:28.645
WHERE THEY'RE AWFULLY PLEA

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:31.582
BARGAIN WAS ENTERED BY THOSE ALL

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.251
IN ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO BECAUSE

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.385
THOSE VIOLATIONS.

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:36.954
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE PURSUING

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.289
THE ECONOMIC OF RESTITUTION FOR

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:40.724
THE WORKERS MATTER FACT IN THAT

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:41.425
PARTICULAR CASE THAT I'M

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.926
REFERRING TO IS GOING FORWARD

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:45.229
TODAY ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS FOR

THE UNIT IS DOING THAT.

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:53.570
ON BUT WHAT IT'S BECOME CLEAR

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:54.538
OVER THE LAST.

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:55.472
YOUR OR TWO IS THAT THE AMOUNT

00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.007
OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:57.274
THIS IS.

00:47:57.341 --> 00:47:58.175
ALL COMMITTED TO THIS IS

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.610
INSUFFICIENT TO HAVING A

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.978
REASONABLE SAMPLE AT A

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.913
REASONABLE INPUT INTO THE SYSTEM

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.947
OVERALL.

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:06.350
AND IT'S THOUGHT THAT ON BY

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:08.585
ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.287
THAT UNIT WE CAN EXTEND THE

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:12.356
SUCCESSES THAT THE UNIT IS HAD

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:14.424
THOSE FOR ALL TO TWO MORE TO

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.827
MORE SITUATIONS AND CONTINUE. TO

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:17.928
GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THE

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:20.530
SITUATION SUCH THAT THE ALL LAWS

00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:21.498
ARE BEING ENFORCED IN THE

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.467
WORKERS OF WHO RELY ON US IN

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:24.768
THOSE LAWS.

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.236
ARE HAVING ARE GETTING REMEDIES

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:29.273
AND GETTING RESTITUTION FOR THE

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:32.709
WAGES THAT ARE OWED.

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.044
UNDER THIS WE WOULD BE ADDING ON

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.145
A COUPLE OF ATTORNEYS TO THE

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:35.879
UNIT.

00:48:35.946 --> 00:48:38.282
ALSO OF THERE WOULD BE ON

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:40.117
INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:42.719
INVESTIGATORS -- IN THE THE HOPE

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.888
IS THAT WHILE WE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:47.224
BE DOING FEW WERE REFUSE OF

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.559
INCOMING PAGA NOTICES THAT THE

00:48:49.626 --> 00:48:50.761
REVIEW THAT THE WORK THAT WE

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.696
WOULD BE DOING ON THOSE WOULD BE

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:53.964
MARCH MORE THOROUGH.

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.400
AND WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR FIRST

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:57.401
FEW YEARS SO THAT'S BEEN

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:59.202
THOROUGH UP TILL NOW.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.570
NO IT'S BEEN WELL IT'S IT'S BEEN

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:03.040
THOROUGH FOR THE ONES THAT WE

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:06.443
HAVE TAKEN ON AND SO ON WITH THE

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.811
RESULT THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:10.814
LEVELS OF REVIEWS -- THAT WE DO --

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.849
SO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHEN WE

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:14.418
GET WE AND WE GET ABOUT

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.219
APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED NEW

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:19.389
PAGA CLAIMS BEING FILED EACH

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:22.726
MONTH WITH THE LW DA -- IN WILL

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.794
BE TO AS WE WE DO PROVIDE OF

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.629
APPLY SOME ANALYTICS TO THAT

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:29.666
TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON PRIORITY

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:30.133
AREAS.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.135
SO NO FOR THE STATE FOR THE L.

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:33.804
W. D. A. AND THE LABOR

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:40.644
COMMISSIONER ON THE PRIORITY IS

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.512
TO LOOK AT INDUSTRIES WHERE LOW

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.448
WAGE WORKERS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:45.749
OF TO A LARGE EXTENT.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:46.983
THERE ARE MANY OTHER BLOG PAGA

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.719
NOTICES TO COME IN FOR OTHER

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.921
INDUSTRIES FOR EXAMPLE FINANCIAL

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.289
SERVICES WITH RELATIVELY HIGH

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.725
PAID INDIVIDUALS INSURANCE

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.259
INDUSTRY THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:57.861
IN THOSE INSTANCES IN OF THOSE

00:49:57.928 --> 00:50:00.230
CASES ARE BEING HANDLED

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:01.898
CURRENTLY BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:07.003
AND ON THEY CAN DOG DO THAT.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.138
SUFFICIENTLY ON WHEN IT COMES TO

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.940
THE ISSUE OF THE LOW WAGE

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:12.109
INDUSTRIES ON YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.344
WHERE WE SEE ON THE MOST ABUSE

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.147
AND AND AND ONE OF FOCUS THE THE

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:17.748
ATTENTION.

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.082
WELL I AGREE WE NEED PREPARERS

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.784
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT MOST OF THE

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:21.885
MONEY GOES TO THE ATTORNEYS

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:24.454
THESE CASES AND NOT THE WORKERS.

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.622
WELL THAT.

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:26.757
THAT GETS TO THIS THIS ONE OF

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.058
THE OTHER AREAS WHICH IS OUR

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.459
REVIEW OF THE SETTLEMENT SO IT

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.628
IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT THE ALL

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.896
THAT'S THE I I YOU KNOW WE WE

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:34.164
DON'T HAVE.

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:35.799
ALL THAT JUST FOR ANECDOTALLY IT

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.634
APPEARS TO BE CORRECT IT IF IT

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.437
APPEARS THAT IN MANY INSTANCES

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:47.611
ON THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES.

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:50.080
OUR OUR YOU KNOW PROPORTIONATELY

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:51.214
OUTSIZED SO FOR OUT TO PROTECT

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:51.782
THE WORKERS SHOULD IN THE

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:52.649
MAJORITY OF THE MONEY THAT IS

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.683
COLLECTED GO THE WORKERS AND NOT

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.951
THE ATTORNEYS.

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.353
OLD ABSOLUTELY.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.188
OKAY ABSOLUTELY HOW WE GO ABOUT

00:50:58.255 --> 00:50:59.856
FIXING THAT.

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.591
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:03.393
IS WE ARE REVIEWING THOSE AND

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:03.927
WHAT.

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:05.929
AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO WITH WITH

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.297
PART OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING.

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:11.101
IS TO BE INTERVENING IN COURT.

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.170
TO LOG COMMENT EDWARD

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.005
APPROPRIATE CHALLENGE ALL

00:51:15.071 --> 00:51:17.007
PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS IS BEING

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:20.243
YOU KNOW OUT OF WHACK IN DOG IT

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.578
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD.

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:23.814
SEE OURSELVES DOING OVER THE

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.681
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.284
IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE OF

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.752
THE PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN A

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:33.190
LIMITED AMOUNT OF ON ENGAGEMENT

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:34.024
WITH WOMEN -- REVIEWING THAT THE

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.459
PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BUT THERE

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.860
HAVE BEEN A LIMITED NUMBER OF

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.762
CASES WHICH WERE WHERE WE'VE

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:40.630
ACTUALLY INTERVENED.

00:51:40.697 --> 00:51:42.299
ON TO COMMENT IN DAHLE PURSUE

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:44.734
THAT WE WOULD SEE THAT UNDER THE

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:45.702
PROPOSAL.

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:48.338
BEING LARGELY INCREASED SO THAT

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:50.073
WE WOULD BE COMMENTING ON

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.042
APPROXIMATELY SIX CASES A YEAR

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:54.744
IN COURT TRYING TO HAVE AN

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.480
IMPACT THAT WAY. ONE

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.114
LEGISLATURE'S ALWAYS BEEN. FOR

00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:00.083
THE WORKERS IN SOME LAWS BE

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.585
PASSED MATURE LAWS. TO ENSURE

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:02.953
WORKERS RIGHT SO.

00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:04.221
I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE IN THIS

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.489
REPORT.

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:07.858
AS FAR AS TRYING TO ADJUST THAT%

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:08.859
TO MAKE SURE THOSE FUNDS GO THE

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.126
WORKERS SO.

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:11.261
IT BE GOOD TO SEE THAT AT SOME

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.696
POINT REALLY IDENTIFIES THAT IS

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.264
BEING IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IN

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:15.932
REVIEWING CASES WITH STAFF I

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:20.036
MEAN IT'S IT'S GLARINGLY --

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.938
RELEVANT THAT AND NOT RELEVANT

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.241
BUT IT'S IT'S JUST CLEARLY THAT --

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:25.275
EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES THE ONES THAT

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.611
ARE COMING ON THE SHORT END OF

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:28.678
THE STICK YOUR SITE WILL CITIES

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:30.113
IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT WE DO.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.248
RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE WE JUST HAD A

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:33.850
CASE IN SAN JOSE WITH RESTAURANT

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.218
WORKERS.

00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:40.023
WARES SOMEHOW THIS EMPLOYER.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.458
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.893
HOURS PASSED THE THE DAY OR

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:43.827
FORTY AND WE NEEDED TO BE PAID A

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:44.694
TIME AND A HALF WE PICKED UP

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:45.362
THAT CASE BECAUSE WE SAW WAS FOR

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.430
LOW WAGE WORKERS WE WORKED THE

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:49.332
CASE UP WE ENDED UP GETTING A

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:50.467
RESOLUTION.

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:52.202
OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:55.438
ON THAT CASE WHICH MORE THAN --

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.374
COMPENSATED THE WORKER FOR THE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.842
WORKERS FOR THE UNPAID WAGES.

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:01.411
AND WHAT WE RECEIVED FOR THE

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:04.714
STATE ON THAT CASE WAS ONE

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:05.282
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.283
CIVIL PENALTIES.

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.450
NO WE THINK THE OBVIOUSLY OUR

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:09.352
FIRST GOAL IN THE WORK THAT WE

00:53:09.419 --> 00:53:10.487
DO.

00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:12.222
IS TO GET THE MONEY INTO THE

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:15.659
POCKETS OF THE WORKERS -- IN SO

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.727
THAT'S WHAT WE DO OF WE WE WE TO

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:19.596
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS IN THEM

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:21.998
WE WE LITIGATE THE CASES IF NEED

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.934
BE TO GET THAT RESULTS SO BY

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.368
BEING AGGRESSIVE WITH THAT WE

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.070
THINK WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING.

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.104
THE END THAT THE THAT YOU'RE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.340

THERE -- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.060
SOME OF THOSE INSURANCES DO

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.396
TAKES MORE TIME -- AND SO THE

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.198

PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES AND

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.266
INTENTIONALLY AND THEN -- WOULD

ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND I

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.047

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:40.816
AGENCIES WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.617
FOR THE FUNDING AND THE SPECIFIC

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:43.885
CONTEXT IS.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.220
LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:58.633
PLANNING OR STAFFING AND JUST

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.402
THAT PARTICULAR BILL ALONE COULD

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.104
RESULT IN THIRTY THOUSAND NEW

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.338
UNITS OF HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:04.673
WITH AT LEAST A THIRD OF THAT

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:08.043
BEING AVAILABLE -- TO TO LOWER

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.678
INCOME INDIVIDUALS SO.

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:10.812
AT THE LEAST I'D LIKE TO ASK AND

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:11.546
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:12.447
CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHETHER

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.316
BART COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.685
FUNDING. FOR IMPLEMENTING A LAW

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:17.786
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR HOUSING

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.354
PRODUCTION ON PART OWNED LAND

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.956
BUT MORE GENERALLY I'D LIKE TO

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.058
ASK A QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.059
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSIT

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.228

I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TRANSIT AGE

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:38.573
I WOULD LET ME DOUBLE CHECK TO

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.641
COME BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.042
TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE ELIGIBLE

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:41.977
OPTIONS AND OF THE INFIRM --

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:42.978

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.480
REQUEST THAT THAT BE CONSIDERED

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.481

DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:55.190
INFRASTRUCTURE THE PLAN IT IS

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:56.191
PART OWN LAND.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.392
SO IT'S UP TO THEM AT THIS

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.127
MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.529
THAT AND THEY'RE IN. TWO DOZEN

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:02.931

CALIFORNIA HOW TO DO THAT AND

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.269

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:18.213
BIG RIGHT.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.915
ON THE OTHER SIDE TO QUESTIONS I

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.283
HAVE -- PIGGY BACK ON THE ALLEY

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.051
OWES QUESTIONS AROUND

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:26.054
HOMELESSNESS -- SO FIRST AGAIN I

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.590
JUST WANT TO SAY THE COMMITMENT

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.358
OF THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT YOU

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.526
ARE.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:32.160
GOING TO PUT INTO HOMELESSNESS

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:34.029
IS IS FANTASTIC I KNOW THAT THE

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.263
ADMINISTRATION IS CHARACTERIZED

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.365
THE MONEY AS GOING TO ONE TIME

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.201
INTERVENTIONS -- BUT THERE ARE

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:40.969
CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESTRICTIONS

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.804
OF FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:43.805
LEVEL TO RESPOND HOMELESSNESS

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.373
AND THE REALITY IS THIS IS THE

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.108
SECOND YEAR OF SO CALLED ONE

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.044
TIME FUNDING -- AND I THINK

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.111
THEY'RE JUST CONCERNED TO MAKE

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.680
SURE THAT IT FOR SPENDING THIS

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.715
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT BE PUT

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:54.482
TO TO BEST USE AND I THINK WE

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.050
ALL SHARE THAT.

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.519
SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WITH

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.820
THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:00.622
PRECLUDE ANY OF THE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.157
JURISDICTIONS CITY COUNTY

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.658
CONTINUANCE OF CARE.

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:07.395
FROM USING FUNDING FOR

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:08.330
INTERVENTIONS LIKE.

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:09.064
THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF A

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:09.864
SHELTER OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.499
DEVELOPMENT LONGER TERM RENTAL

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:12.934
ASSISTANCE PERSONS RAPID RE

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.336
HOUSING AND INCENTIVES TO

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.204
LANDLORDS. TO ACCEPT TENANTS AND

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:17.205
WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.608
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EFINITIONS

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:20.842
OF THE LISTS OF USES FOR THESE

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:23.678
FUNDS.

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:26.014
SURE AND SO WE HAVE MADE THE

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:27.716
USES A LOT MORE FLEXIBLE WITH

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.217
REGARD TO THOSE SPECIFIC I DON'T

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:30.252

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:31.953
CALLED OUT I DON'T KNOW -- I'LL

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.188
HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.990

WHERE THEY CAN BE USED AS ONE

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:49.070

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.912
REAL EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES

01:21:57.979 --> 01:21:58.446
FOR MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF

01:21:58.513 --> 01:21:59.314
HOMELESSNESS.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.416
SO LONG TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.084
PROJECT BASED HOUSING VOUCHERS

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:04.619
THAT ARE TIED TO SUPPORT HOUSING.

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.054
OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.389
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:08.790
I'LL JUST GIVE THE EXAMPLE THAT

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:10.659
RAPID RE HOUSING WHILE IT'S BEEN

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.127
USEFUL FOR SOME FOLKS HAS NOT

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:13.995
BEEN AS EFFECTIVE AS I THINK WE

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.397
ALL ANTICIPATED BECAUSE IT'S

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:16.298
TIME LIMITED.

01:22:16.364 --> 01:22:17.832
AND AT THE END OF THE ASSISTANCE

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.467
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN AFFORDABLE

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.303
PLACE TO MOVE AND SO.

01:22:21.369 --> 01:22:22.704
MY HOPE IS THAT THE TRAILER BILL

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.572
LANGUAGE EXPLICITLY REQUIRES

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:25.974
PROGRAM FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.642
INTERVENTIONS THAT MOVE PEOPLE

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:29.277
TOWARD PERMANENT HOUSING

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:31.913
SOLUTIONS -- AND THEN ONE THING

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.882
I ACTUALLY LIKE TO ASK THAT BUT

01:22:33.948 --> 01:22:35.383
I HOPE IS IS NOT DIFFICULT AS I

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.918
HOPE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.486
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES A REPORT

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.889
BACK. TO ALL OF US ON THE USE OF

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:43.224
FUNDS AND SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.060
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED INTO.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.028
PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS --

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:47.996
IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND YOU KNOW

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.764

THIS YEAR.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.967
WE NEED TO KNOW FROM LOCAL

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.803

THAT NEXT YEAR IF WE HAVE THIS

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.939
CONVERSATION WHICH WE PROBABLY

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:58.606
WELL.

01:22:58.673 --> 01:22:59.874
WE KNOW WHERE THE BEST ON THE

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:00.975
MONEY I DON'T THINK ANYONE KNOWS

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:05.146
THAT AT THIS POINT BASED ON WHAT

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:05.747
HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND WE LIKE

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.615
TO FIGURE THAT OUT. ONE LAST

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:10.185
THING I KNOW WHO -- THE

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.686
TROUBLING PATROL BILL LANGUAGE

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:13.188

INCOME TAX BLOG HOUSING TAX

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.658
CREDIT RIGHT THAT THAT WAS NOT

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:20.829
AGENDAS FOR TODAY'S MEETING.

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.263
TEL AVIV MORALS ASSEMBLY BUDGET

WANTED THEM TO THEY CAN TALK

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:31.139
ABOUT ANY OF IT.

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:31.606
OKAY.

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:34.476
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:35.210
WANT TO SET THIS POINT ON HOW

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:35.844
YOU'RE PLANNING TO RESOLVE THE

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.045
ISSUES THAT ARE SWIRLING AROUND

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:38.713
THE TAX FOR IT.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.682
AND THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS

THAT WE ARE TAUGHT WE TOOK IT

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:46.187
DOWN SO THAT BECAUSE WE REALIZE

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.322
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.190
TO BE TAUGHT -- CHANGED A NET

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:50.558
AND WORKING ON THOSE AND WILL BE

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.827
POSTED AGAIN ONCE WE'VE REACHED

01:23:52.894 --> 01:23:54.229
DECISIONS ON APPRECIATE THAT I'D

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.063
LET ME JUST TOUCH ON A FEW

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.631
ISSUES THAT I'LL BE LOOKING AT

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:58.133
WHICH IS.

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.467
ONE I UNDERSTAND.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.136
THAT THE TRAILER BILL IS MAYBE

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.304
PROPOSED A 30% CREDIT AS OPPOSED

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.540
TO A 50% CREDIT -- HAVE

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:07.242
QUESTIONS AROUND THAT -- WE KNOW

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:09.210
THAT THE HIGHER CREDITS USUALLY

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:11.446
NEEDED FOR HIGHER COST AREAS TO

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.748
PROVIDE ENOUGH SUBSIDIES SO --

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:15.150
SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER THE

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.118
LOWER AMOUNT IS THE RIGHT ONE

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:18.853

OUT WHAT THAT WILL ENTAIL.

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:21.723
THE SECOND THING I WANT TO

MENTION IS JUST ENSURING THAT

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:25.226
FOR THE CREDIT TO BE EFFECTIVE

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:27.095

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.570

HOUSING COMMUNITY BELIEVES IT'S

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:38.807

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.190
CONCERNS AND BEEN RAISED ABOUT

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:56.424
IF YOU DON'T HAVE COMPETITION

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.126
HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT PROJECTS

SOME WORKLOAD AND SOME REVIEW BY

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:29.183
THE COUNCIL STAFF TO MAKE SURE

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.719

OF THE NEW GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:36.123
THAT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:37.191
ENTITIES DOING THEIR OWN THING

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:40.428

BOTH OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS SO

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:48.402
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:50.872
LEARNED FROM HE IS THAT.

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:51.973
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:54.375

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.258
THE GRANT MANAGER FOR HEAP --

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:12.927

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.529

INTERNATIONAL TRADE.

01:47:56.369 --> 01:47:57.771
PROMOTION ACTIVITIES.

01:47:57.838 --> 01:48:00.907
IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN THAT

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:02.876
AGENCY WAS ABOLISHED -- OUR

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:03.910
OFFICE ROUTE ON THAT.

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:05.679
THAT WE LONG HAD QUESTIONED THE

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:08.181
VALUE AND IMPACT OF MANY OF THE

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:10.016
AGENCY'S PROGRAMS.

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.151
WE FOUND THAT EVEN AT PEAK

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:12.652
FUNDING.

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:15.121
THE STATE STREET AGENCY PROGRAMS

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.323
ASSISTED ONLY A VERY SMALL

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:16.556
PORTION.

01:48:16.623 --> 01:48:18.458
OF TARGETED.

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.160
INDUSTRIES ARE BUSINESSES.

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:21.761
AND WE SPECIFICALLY NOTED THAT

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.430
TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES.

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:25.565
CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO

01:48:25.632 --> 01:48:27.067
DEMONSTRATE A CLEAR IMPACT.

01:48:27.133 --> 01:48:29.736
ON EXPORTS OR FOREIGN INVESTMENT.

01:48:29.803 --> 01:48:31.438
OVER THAT PERIOD OF THE LATE

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:33.073
EIGHTIES NINETIES INTO THE EARLY

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:35.508
TWO THOUSANDS.

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:36.576
WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:39.012
STATE INVOLVEMENT IS UNNECESSARY.

01:48:39.079 --> 01:48:40.247
IN MOST INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS

01:48:40.313 --> 01:48:42.082
TRANSACTIONS.

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:43.516
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:46.152
AFFECT A STATE SHARE.

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.721
OF INTERNATIONAL EXPORTS AND

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:48.922
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT.

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.523
AND WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:53.226
RESOURCES REQUESTED BY GOBIZ

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:54.261
WOULD HAVE MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON

01:48:54.327 --> 01:48:55.528
THAT TREND THAT.

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:57.030
THAT THE GOV IS MENTIONED JUST

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:58.598
RECENTLY.

01:48:58.665 --> 01:48:59.799
MOREOVER TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:01.635
COMPANIES CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.403
TRANSACT BUSINESS IN FOREIGN

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.738
MARKETS ON THEIR OWN THE FEDERAL

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.273

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:13.647
SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE
