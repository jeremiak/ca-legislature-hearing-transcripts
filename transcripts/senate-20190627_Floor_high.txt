SINCE THEN ICE HAS ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS PREDATORY AND DECEITFUL TACTICS THAT ARE HURTING ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THESE PLOYS INCLUDE OFFICIALS MAKING ARRESTS IN SAFE PLACES LIKE COURT HOUSES AND SCHOOLS. AND UNLAWFULLY ANNOUNCING THEMSELVES AS POLICE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO DECEIVE THOSE TARGETED. THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE OFFICIALS HAS UNDERMINED THE TRUST BETWEEN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND THE VERY AGENCIES MEANT TO KEEP US SAFE WHEN TRUST IS ERODED OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER. FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR BEING APPREHENDED BY ICE WORKPLACE HAZARDS HEALTH VIOLATIONS AND INJURIES GO UNREPORTED TO OSHA. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR CANNOT FULLY INVESTIGATE ILLEGAL WORKPLACE PRACTICES BECAUSE OFTEN THOSE WHO ARE EXPLOITED ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND WILL NOT FIBER FILE REPORTS. DUE TO FEAR THIS PUTS ALL EMPLOYEES AT RISK ADDITIONALLY CRIMES ARE NOT REPORTED TO OUR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR THAT HAS BEEN CREATED. THESE ON REPORTED CRIMES MAKE ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SAFE NOT JUST OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES DESPITE THIS FACT WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY LOCALLY IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGH LEGISLATION I SAYS CONTINUE TO DEPLOY THESE SHAMEFUL RUSSES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL THEREFORE THIS RESOLUTION URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INSTRUCT ICE TO STOP THE DECEITFUL AND DANGEROUS PLOYS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS. AS WELL AS TO ADOPT UNIFORM STANDARDS BY WHICH ICE OFFICERS CAN HUMANELY OPERATE ONCE THESE HARMFUL BEHAVIORS ARE CORRECTED IT'S MY HOPE THE CALIFORNIA CAN FOSTER THE GROWTH OF TRUST. BETWEEN OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ONCE AGAIN. AS IF THERE EVER WAS A STATE WHO RELIED SO HEAVILY ON THE WORK. WORK ETHIC HARD MANUAL LABOR AND DETERMINATION OF IMMIGRANTS IT IS CALIFORNIA OUR STATE PROGRESS IS A BEACON TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES LOOKING FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY THROUGH HARD WORK. SOCIAL MOBILITY THAT FUELS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC VIBRANCY CULTURAL RICHNESS AND STAFF STATUS AS A WORLD LEADER THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR.

CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT -- AB ONE TWENTY DEALS WITH THE NUMBER OF SEATS ON THE METROPOLITAN WALLER WATER DISTRICT A DISTRICT THAT WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND IT WAS. BASED ON THE SAYS VALUES -- EVALUATION OF PROPERTY. AND THAT'S HOW THEY DETERMINE THEIR SEATS TODAY -- THE METROPOLITAN -- DISTRICT NO LONGER IS FUNDED THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES BUT CONTINUES TO USE THE SAME ABOUT A METHOD THAT WAS DOUBTLESS. EIGHTY YEARS AGO -- SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL WILL HELP INSURE SOME OF THE HIGH DEVELOPED IN DENSE URBAN COMMUNITIES DO NOT LOSE REPRESENTATION ON THE METROPOLITAN WATER BOARD.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THIS BILL ENSURES THAT HONORABLY RETIRED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS. HAVE SIMILAR RIGHTS TO OTHER PEACE OFFICERS INCLUDING THEIR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY COUNTERPARTS. CURRENT LAW PERMITS HONORABLY RETIRED PEACE OFFICERS TO CARRY A CONCEALED WEAPON DUE TO THEIR ADVANCED TRAINING AND SERVICE. TO THE COMMUNITY. ON HONORABLY RETIRED DESIGNATION MEANS THEY ACCEPT A SERVICE OR DISABILITY RETIREMENT. AND THEY RECEIVE AN ID CARD TO PROVE THEIR STATUS. THIS ISSUE AROSE BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A DISABILITY RETIREMENT CATEGORY. SIMILAR TO THE CALPERS% RETIREMENT SYSTEM INSTEAD OFFICERS ARE KATTER CATEGORIZES INJURED AND MEDICALLY SEPERATED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS AS DUTY DISABILITY INCOME RECIPIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. VALLEY JACOBS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. PEACE OFFICER WHO HELPED RESCUE KIDNAPPING VICTIM JAYCEE DUGARD. SUFFERED AN ON DUTY INJURY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND ACCEPTED DUTY DISABILITY INCOME. SHE HAS CONTINUALLY BEEN DENIED ON HONORABLY RETIRED IDENTIFICATION CARD. AND A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. THIS BILL WOULD FIX THAT TECHNICAL DISCREPANCY IN ALLOW THESE RETIRED [inaudible] SKIMMING. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS SIMILAR TREATMENT AS OTHER PEACE OFFICERS AROUND THE STATE SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. AS MANY OF US HAVE READ WITH HORROR AN INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO DOWN IN CORONA. WHERE AN OFF DUTY POLICE OFFICER CARRYING A CONCEALED FIREARM SHOT AND KILLED A FELLOW AND SERIOUSLY INJURED HIS FAMILY? AT A COSTCO. AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT DE ESCALATING SITUATIONS OF VIOLENCE WHY IN THE WORLD ARE WE ADDING TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO CAN CONTINUE TO CARRY CONCEALED FIREARMS. AND I JUST -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT OUR UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICERS ARE TRAINED BUT MY QUESTION IS WHY ARE WE ADDING MORE PEOPLE TO THE LIST TO CAN CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS. AND IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THIS WHEN DE ESCALATION MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE SAVE LIVES HERE HE WAS WITH A LOADED WEAPON IN HAND WHICH HE CHOSE TO USE THAT ENDED THE LIFE OF ONE INDIVIDUAL OUTSIDE A COSTCO. FOR PETE'S SAKE. AND THE KIND OF THIS KIND OF ATTITUDE WHERE WE ARE REACH FOR THE GUN FIRST AND IF YOU HAVE A GUN AVAILABLE THE LAST THING SADLY THAT SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO DO. IS TRY TO WALK AWAY FROM A DANGEROUS SITUATION I FIND NO JUSTIFICATION TO IT TO ALLOW FOR AND ENCOURAGE THE INCREASE OF THESE CONCEALED WEAPONS. AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. MEN WOMEN I SURE OF WORTH ON A RELATED DISTINCTLY. THEY HAVE GIVEN. THEIR TIME RIGHT NOW WE JUST RECENTLY TODAY AS A MATTER OF FACT WE'RE BEARING ONE OF OUR OWN. TARA IS NOW LAID TO REST WITH HONOR. AND I THINK IT IS REFLECTIVE AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES. WHO SUPPORT AND PROTECT US EACH AND EVERY DAY THAT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PROTECT THIS? IS A CONTINUATION OF THEIR DUTY TO RECEIVE THAT. THAT CERTIFICATE THE BADGE AND AND TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THE FIREARM AFTER RETIREMENT. AND BECAUSE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT I'VE SHARED WITH WHO I KNOW. PERSONALLY THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE THE RIGHT THING AND YES THERE'S ALWAYS. ONE BUT THINK ABOUT THE THOUSANDS EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT DO THE RIGHT THING WITH THAT I SUPPORT THIS BILL NOT URGENT I VOTE. THANK YOU SEN ARCHULETA CENTER GROWTH. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- FOR SEVERAL REASONS I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS BUT AND I UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA'S ARGUMENT ABOUT HAVING TO FIRE ARMS ON CAMPUS. BUT I I ADDRESS THE THE DOUGLAS OF THE SYSTEM AND DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL ISSUE. AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THEY HAD ARMED PEOPLE AVAILABLE THERE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE IS FIRING FIRING AT YOU. I'M WAITING FOR NINE ONE ONE TO RESPOND OR WAITING FOR AN OFFICER TO GO ACROSS CAMPUS. TO TO DEFEND YOU ARE SAVE YOU IS -- SECONDS COUNT AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO GET TO AT THAT VERY MOMENT. AND THE PEOPLE OF A SMALL NARROW GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY AUTHORIZES ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINED THEY'RE MOST LIKELY POST CERTIFIED. SO THEY HAVE THE TRAINING NEEDED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE PROPERLY WITH -- INDIVIDUALS IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND TO RESTRICT THEM FROM BEING ABLE NOT TO HAVE A CCW AND RESTRICT THEM FROM NOT CARRYING ON CAMPUSES. YOU KNOW ONE DAY THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT REALLY CARE ABOUT THE STUDENTS WHICH MOST EVERYBODY CARES ABOUT OTHER STUDENTS. THEY'LL BE THE PERSON THAT PROTECTS THEM BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AND I BRING UP THE SCHOOL AGAIN BACKES THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL. THE P. E. TEACHER THE DIM THE GYM TEACHER USED HIS BODY. TO BLOCK BULLETS BEING FIRED AT THE STUDENTS SO THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD BE SAFE DOWN A HALLWAY THAT P. E. TEACHER SAVED MANY STUDENTS LIVES. NOW IN I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WILL DISAGREE WITH ME I WOULD LOVE FOR THAT P. E. TEACHER TO HAVE GONE THROUGH A PRO CERTIFICATION A CCW CLASS. AND WHEN IN A LESS ACTIVE ENGAGE SHOOTER WAS TRYING TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND HIS STUDENTS LIFE I WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR THAT P. TEACHER TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN A STUDENTS. AND STILL BE ALIVE HERE TODAY FOR HIS FAMILY. SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR ALSO MAKING IT VERY NARROW AND NOT BROAD SO THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ADDRESSED. IN A COLLEGIAL MANNER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR GROW SENATOR JACKSON. YES SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CORRECT -- IF I IF I MISSTATED TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ON DUTY POLICE OFFICERS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CAMPUS -- ISSUES I'M TALKING ABOUT RETIRED OFF DUTY POLICE. UC POLICE OFFICERS BEING GIVEN THE RIGHT TO CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS WITH THEM. AFTER THEY RETIRED ANYWHERE THEY CHOOSE TO GO SO MY CONCERN IS. THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH WE HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS -- WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS AND I THINK OF INSTANCES WHERE WITH ALL THE BEST OF INTENTIONS THE USE OF FIREARMS ESCALATING SITUATIONS UNNECESSARILY WHICH HAPPENED AT THE SITUATION AND COSTCO WHICH HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER PLACES? ALSO WHEN YOU USE FIREARMS THE RISK ASSOCIATED FOR EXAMPLE AT THE BORDERLINE INCIDENT WHEN IT WAS INDEED A C. H. P. BULLET. THAT KILLED THE VENTURA COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES ISN'T THERE A BETTER WAY. AND CERTAINLY TO EXPAND CONCEALED WEAPON KERRY TOP OFF DUTY RETIRED. POLICE OFFICERS IS NOT A AN ATTEMPT. TO MERGE THEIR GOOD WORK WHEN THEY WERE ON DUTY BUT IT ASKS THE QUESTION DO WE REALLY WANT TO BE SEEING MORE AND MORE FIREARMS. IN PUBLIC PLACES AND WHAT IF WE DO WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE INSTANCES LIKE WE SAW THIS COSCO JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. AND I FOR ONE DON'T BELIEVE THE SECOND AMENDMENT ENCOURAGES THAT OR PERMITS THAT. I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF COMMON SENSE WE NEED TO START REDUCING DE ESCALATING ALL THE HOSTILITIES THAT WE ARE SEEING IN TODAY'S WORLD. AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER GALGIANI. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK THAT TODAY WE'RE SEEING CONFLICT LIKE WE'VE NEVER EVER SEEN BEFORE. AND OUR OFFICERS ARE EXPOSED TO A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF VIOLENCE. I WENT TO JUST NOW TO LOOK UP TO TELL YOU ABOUT A BLAST OF LIKE NINE GANG MEMBERS AND IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON A FEW DAYS AGO. AND UP POPS AND IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE HAD ANOTHER PERSON KILLED IN A SHOOTING LAST NIGHT OUR OFFICERS WHETHER THEY'RE POLICE OFFICERS ARE SHERIFF'S OR UNIVERSITY OFFICERS THEY ARE PUTTING THEMSELVES. AT RISK AND THEY AFTER RETIRING ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY SEE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE ARRESTED OR OR THAT THEY HAVE. OF CONFRONTED WHO ARE DOING THINGS AGAINST THE LAW AND THEY ARE AT RISK WHEN THEY DO SO AND I ALSO SAY THIS AS SOMEONE WHO LOST MY GODFATHER. A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER HE WAS STABBED TO DEATH A FEW YEARS AGO AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE NOT FORGOTTEN HE SPENT MANY YEARS IN THE COMMUNITY OF RESTING. A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S LIKELY THAT YOU RAN INTO SOMEBODY WHO HE HAD ONCE ARRESTED AND HE DIED OF VERY DIALING VIOLENT DEATH. SO I HAVE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPE YOU WILL. TOO THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I I'D LIKE TO ALLEVIATE MY COLLEAGUE EVER CONCERN INSTEAD OF OUR WRITING I REALLY DIDN'T TAKE YOUR COMMENTS WRONG I UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS SERVED -- THE PUBLIC IN PUBLIC SAFETY POLICE SHERIFFS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SUCH ABOUT SAID. AND IN OUR USE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE RETIRED IT DOESN'T DIMINISH THEIR ABILITY OR QUALITY TO DEAL ARE HAVE A FIREARM OR DE ESCALATE SITUATIONS. THE FIRST THING THAT WERE TRAINED WHEN YOU APPLY FOR CCW IS TO RE TREAT IF YOU CAN. TO RETREAT IF YOU CAN THAT'S ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS THAT WE'RE TRAINED SO I I APPLIED LIKE I SAID THE AUTHOR FOR MAKING IT VERY NARROW. AND TO TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT JUST BECAUSE OUR POLICE OFFICERS HAVE RETIRED -- THEY REALLY HAVE NOT LOST THE TRAINING AND THE FORTITUDE TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE S. SITUATION. THANK YOU SENATOR OF SENATOR MONEY THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR THE FLOOR TRACKING. THROUGH THE CHAIR FIRE AWAY QUESTION CENTER OFF. THANK YOU SO. I UNDERSTAND THE INTEREST POTENTIALLY OF RECOGNIZING THE TRAINING IN THE SERVICE OF THOSE WHO NOW REACH THE AGE OF RETIREMENT. I'M CURIOUS IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT REQUIRES ONGOING CERTIFICATION OR DETERMINATION OF MENTAL. CAPACITY AS PEOPLE GET OLDER -- IN OUR SOCIETY PEOPLE DEAL WITH DEMENTIA ALZHEIMERS. OTHER PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THIS ANYTHING IN THE BILL REQUIRE. PERIODIC RE CERTIFICATION OR MENTAL STATUS. UPDATE WELL I'LL BE FRANK I'M NOT SURE THAT I NECESSARILY KNOW BUT IT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THIS IS A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE C. C. W. WERE I BELIEVE SOMEBODY CAN CORRECT ME. ARE REQUIRED TO FILL THE SAME REQUIREMENTS OF ANYONE ELSE. WITH A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT PERHAPS I CAN HAVE A LIFELINE HERE FOR MY FORMER PEACE OFFICER COLLEAGUES GOOD I APPRECIATE IT THROUGH THE DAY HERE. I AM A PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR C. C. W. YOU HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED EVERY YEAR YOU'VE GOT TO GO INTO THE STATION. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN HANDLE IT AND ALSO AS TIME GOES ON YES INDEED THERE IS THAT POINT WHERE THEY HAVE SAY OKAY NOW YOUR YOUR LITTLE TOO OLD OR YOU HAVE SOME PROBLEMS. IF AND ALSO IF YOUR RETIRED BECAUSE OF MENTAL STRESS OR MENTAL ISSUES YOU'RE NOT PERMITTED TO GET TO SEE CW AND CARRY THE WEAPON. THANK ALL THAT HE DOES RETIRED IN GOOD PHYSICAL HEALTH WHO CAN HANDLE IMPROVE THEIR CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN THAT WEAPON. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND IN THIS LEGISLATION. THAT DOES CREATE THIS SPECIAL RECOGNITION. FOR CERTAIN RETIRED OFFICERS -- AND I REALIZE THE FLOOR JACQUI ME NOT NO I HAVEN'T READ ALL THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT A CCW PERMIT FOR ANYBODY. INCLUDING THIS CATEGORY WOULD REQUIRE ANNUAL RE CERTIFICATION BUT IS THAT EXPLICIT IN THE BILL OR IS THERE IT WILL THIS BE CONSIDERED A WAIVER -- CARVE OUT FOR THAT ANNUAL. REVIEW WELL I CORRECT THIS THIS IS SIMPLY A TECHNICAL CORRECTION IT'S A SEMANTICS ISSUE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS ANY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. IN THE STATE IF YOU ARE RETIRED BECAUSE OF SERVICE OR RETIRED BECAUSE OF DISABILITY A DISABILITY RETIREMENT UNDER CALPERS SYSTEM AS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER YOU ARE ENTITLED. TO A CONCEALED KERRY. PERMIT UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE SO APTLY DESCRIBED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE UC SYSTEM BECAUSE FOR YOU KNOW THE UC SYSTEM IS A SEPARATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IT IS NOT CALPERS AND THE WAY THEY CHARACTERIZE A DISABILITY RETIREMENT THEY HAVE INTERPRETED THAT AS NOT. BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE AS NOT ENTITLING THEIR DISABILITY DISABLED RETIRED PEACE OFFICERS TO QUALIFY FOR A CCW THIS THIS BILL SIMPLY CORRECTS THAT. TECHNICAL DIFFERENCE AND PUTS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS WHO ALSO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS EVERY OTHER PIECE OFFICER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO RETIRES BY SERVICE OR BY. REASON OF DISABILITY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER MONEY CENTER MINING. CENTER ROCKY MAKE CLOTHES WELL THANK YOU. I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUE FOR SANTA BARBARA BUT I WOULD NOTE. THAT THE COSCO. AND THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THAT SHOOTING. ARE IN MY DISTRICT. THEY ARE MY CONSTITUENTS SO I'M ACUTELY AWARE OF THE SITUATION THAT OCCURRED RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD AT THAT COSCO. ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY. SECOND I WOULD NOTE THAT IS A AS ATTORNEYS. YOU KNOW WE'RE TRAINED -- TO SEEK OUT THE FACTS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THEM BEFORE WE EXPRESS OPINIONS OR DRAW CONCLUSIONS. AND THE LAST TIME I CHECKED. WITH REGARD TO THAT SITUATION THAT TRAGEDY AT THAT COSCO. THE REPORT OF INVESTIGATION HAS NOT ISSUED. WE DO NOT KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THAT PEACE OFFICER DREW HIS WEAPON. AND WHAT AND FIRED WHETHER HE WAS FORCED TO FIRE. OR NOT THE ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT PEACE OFFICER WAS HOLDING. HIS YOUNG CHILD. HIS YOUNG SON. AT THE TIME. SO AS I SAID THIS IS SIMPLY A BILL TO CORRECT CORRECT THE TECHNICAL DEFICIENCY TO PUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ON PAR WITH EVERY OTHER PIECE OFFICER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN THEY RETIRE BY VIRTUE OF SERVICE? OR BY VIRTUE OF DISABILITY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH AND WITH THAT MISTER SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL ALLEN.

TODAY I PRESENT -- AB TWELVE NINETY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER QUE HAN WHICH WOULD UPDATE THE PROCEDURE FOR TAKING OF POSSESSION OF GUNS FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS AN OPERATION OF LAW PROCEDURE. OPERATION OF LAW WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN ORDER TO HELP INDIVIDUALS PROPERLY TAKE POSSESSION OF A FIREARM TO IN A STATE TRUST THE CONSERVATORSHIP. WITHOUT HAVING A GUN DEALER INVOLVED WHICH CAN BE VERY PROBLEMATIC IN THESE SITUATIONS. UNDER THIS PROCEDURE PEOPLE CAN TAKE POSSESSION OF GUNS WITHOUT DEALER INVOLVEMENT BUT MUCH REGISTER THAT GUN. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OBTAIN A FIREARM SAFETY CERTIFICATE AND UNDERGO THE TYPICAL BACKGROUND CHECK. THE DISPOSITION OF THE GUN BY THAT PERSON IS SUBJECT TO THE NORMAL -- THROUGH DEALER PRO PROCESSING RULES. FROM THE NEARLY THIRTY YEARS SINCE OPERATION Là.

SALES AND AUTO DEALERSHIPS AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM LEBANON. THE TICKET THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. AS AN IMMIGRANT FROM LEBANON MISTER HAD CAME TO AMERICA TO CITY ENGINEERING. AND HE HAD A FEW DOLLARS STONE IN HIS POCKET BECAUSE HIS MOM THAT HE WOULD LOSE IT AND A CUTE LITTLE PINK SUITCASE. NOW I KEEP ADDRESSING HIM AS MR HAD AT HE WAS ALLIES CHECKOUT AT A LOT OF PEOPLE CALLED HIM CHECK. BUT I COULD NEVER DO THAT BECAUSE WITH MISTER HADAD CHIVALRY WAS NEVER DEAD HE HAD A QUIET AUTHORITATIVE KINDA FATHERLY WAY ABOUT HIM.

HE STARTED AT SCHOOL BACK EAST BUT HE QUICKLY MOVED TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS MUCH NICER. AS A STUDENT STAMPER HE WALKED ON AT A CAR DEALERSHIP IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN TO BUY HIS FIRST CAR IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
