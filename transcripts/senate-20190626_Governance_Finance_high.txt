FACING GENERALLY LIKE TO BE A TO GET RIGHT INTO IT. WE ARE GOING TO WELCOME THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO BE ABLE TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAISES HERE SOMEONE REYES IS GOING TO PRISON TEEN ON AB. TWO THIRTEEN TWO THIRTEEN WHICH IS FOCUSED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FINANCE. DELIVER THE FLOOR IS YOURS IS GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWO THIRTEEN IS A MEASURE BUILT ON FAIRNESS THAT WOULD RESTORE REVENUES THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE ALLOCATED TO CITIES THAT ANNEXED INHABITED TERRITORIES. AVENUES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY. BY THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SB EIGHTY NINE A PREVIOUS BUDGET TRAILER TRAILER BILL WAS PASSED DURING STATE BUDGET DIFFICULTIES. THIS LEGISLATION IN EFFECT TOOK AWAY TWO HUNDRED MILLION. ANNUALLY IN VEHICLE LICENSE FEE REVENUES FROM CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AS A PART OF THIS CHANGE MANY OF THESE AFFECTED. MANY OF THOSE AFFECTED WERE NEWLY INCORPORATED AREAS AND CITIES WHO HAD ANNEXED. NEW TERRITORIES THIS CALLS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ULTIMATELY LOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN REVENUE. THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CITIES. THAT HAVE ANNEXED WHO HAVE LOST REVENUE DUE TO THIS TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LEGISLATION. CITIES INCLUDE THE CITY OF FONTANA IN MY DISTRICT. WHICH LOSES APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. FOR ANNEXING CITIES MANY OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY CASH STRAPPED TO THE LOSS OF THIS CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING HURTS THE RESIDENTS. CITIES PUT IN THIS POSITION OFTEN MUST CUT CRITICAL SERVICES SUCH S INVESTING AND LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE FOR WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE AN INCOMPLETE BUDGET. ANOTHER PRACTICAL EFFECT OF CURRENT LAW IS THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST IN ANNEXATION. GIVEN LIMITATIONS REGARDING NEW REVENUE THE CITIES ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO OBTAIN. THE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF SB EIGHTY NINE THE CITY IS NOW ARM LESS LIKELY. TO ANNEX BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A BURDEN SOME EFFORT. WE DON'T GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR RESIDENTS WE ARE ACTIVELY CREATING A DISINCENTIVE FOR ANNEXATION. WEMUST EMPOWER OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE REVIEW INDIVIDUALS TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY JOINT AUTHOR IS IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE SO SHE ASKED THAT I SENT -- HER REGARDS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRISTY SMITH WHO HAS SOME CITIES ALSO OF WHO ARE LOSING THE REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE OF THIS BILL -- BUT WITH US TODAY OR DAN CARRIED WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CITY OF FONTANA. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU GENTLEMAN YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SUMMER WOMAN OF COURSE TO MISS SMITH IS WELL FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS BILL. SCARED FOR SOURCE OR TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SAID DAN CARRIED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES. THIS BILL IN THE AUTHOR'S STATEMENT -- WAS QUITE A COMPREHENSIVE IN TERMS OF COVERING THE ISSUES BUT REALLY DEALS WITH TWO THINGS ONE IT'S ADDRESSING AN INEQUITY -- AND THE SECONDIS REESTABLISHING WHAT IS -- WHAT WE PREFER PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN GOOD POLICY -- IN THIS STATE A LOT OF IT FORMED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST RELATED TO ANNEXATION ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO DEAL WITH GROWTH GOING FORWARD. SO IN TERMS OF THE INEQUITY ON IS THE AUTHOR SAID -- THERE WERE A A MANY COMMUNITIES THAT -- IN ORDER OPINION HAD GONE OUT AND DONE THE RIGHT THING THEY HAD A BROUGHT IN -- IN -- IN ANNEXED INHABITED AREAS OFTEN THESE AREAS -- MAYBE HAVE -- THEIR COUNTY ON A CORPORATE OR IS THEY MIGHT HAVE LESS -- ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE -- IN SERVICES AND SO BY BRINGING THESE COMMUNITIES -- INTO THE CITY AND SERVING THEM THAT THE CITY WOULD BE TAKING ON ADDITIONAL SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ALSO PROVIDING HAVE SERVICES TO THE RESIDENT. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH LOTS OF CORE OF OTHER POLICIES A STATUS VOTERS ON RELATED TO TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR WATER QUALITY OF SERVICES TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS DEALING WITH THE ISSUES WITH DISADVANTAGED ON A CORPORATE REYES X. ULTRA. SO THOSE CITIES ONE OUT IN OUR OPINION DID THE RIGHT POLICY THING BY BY BRINGING IN IN SERVING THESE AREAS AND IN IN PART OF THE WAY THOSE PENCIL OUT WAS IN RELIANCE UPON THESE REVENUES THAT THAT EXISTED. SO -- AS THE AUTHOR SAID A BILL WENT THROUGH NO HEARINGS NOTHING -- WIPED OUT THOSE THOSE FUNDS AND SOME OF OF OUR CITIES FONTANA AND OTHERS LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY OF THAT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT ANOTHER CITY THAT IS -- WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED WAS THE CITY OF CHICO -- WHICH IT HAD IT HAD A LOT OF UNINCORPORATED ISLANDS WITHIN THE CITY AND I THINK IN THE PAST WAS ACTUALLY ARE ECOGNIZED AND PRAISED. FOR WORKING WITH LASKO IN AND BRING IN A LOT OF THESE ISLANDS AND AS YOU ALL KNOW -- CHICO'S BASICALLY THE BASE CAMP FOR THE THE RIGHT REBUILDING OF PARADISE AND IS IN CURRENT A LOT OF ADDITIONAL A COST ASSOCIATED WITH SO THE THE IF THE FIXING THIS INEQUITY IS IS A IS A GOOD GOOD THING IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO FIXED -- THERE WERE FOUR INCORPORATED CITIES THAT ALSO HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE LEGISLATURE FIX THAT ISSUE TWO YEARS AGO THIS IS THE SAME FIX. I ENDED UP FOR FOR THE CITY'S AT ANNEX THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS ON ON ON ON YES I KNOW I'M RIGHT NEAR THE EDGE THERE MISTER CHAIR. ON THE RE ESTABLISHING GOOD POLICY GOING FORWARD WE ALL KNOW THE STATE IS GOING TO GROW WE ALL KNOW THAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GROWTH POLICIES THAT THE STATE WANTS TO OUR PROMOTE THAT TRIES TO A CONCENTRATE GROWTH IN IN IN IN DENSITIES IN IN URBAN AREAS THERE'S ALL SORTS OF REASONS FOR THAT. REESTABLISHING OUR ANNEXATION INCENTIVES GOING FORWARD WE THINK IS ALSO GOOD POLICY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO MUCH SKERIK GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN IN MINUTES AS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHASING AND SOLVE THIS REPRESENTING THE CITIES OF MONTANA CAMARILLO. SANTA CLARITA AND SAN BERNARDINO AND JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- FOR THE CITY OF FONTANA ANTIQUATED TO ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS -- THIS BILL WOULD RESTORE THAT FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OFFER THE AUTHOR FOR DOING SO SENATE CREATE IS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR POLICE OFFICERS AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THEY WERE THEY CUTS -- ME THE MOST OF THIS TAKES CARE THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT A WEEK WE THANK BOTH OFF AUTHORS FOR THEIR EFFORTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH GRATEFUL FOR JUST LIABILITY THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE NOT AN OPEN IT UP FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FIRST AND LAST.

YOU KNOW I IF YOU'RE TO INDULGE ME FOR JUST A MOMENT PLEASE MISTER CHAIR I WAS HERE LAST WEEK AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ANNEXATIONS AND SENATOR HER TITLE BROUGHT UP. AS DID SENATOR MORE LOCK THE LACK OF A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR CITIES TO ANNEX TERRITORY. AND A SENSE THIS AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVE WAS TAKEN AWAY LAUGH BECAUSE OF ACTUALLY SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE AT ABOUT HALF THEIR PROCESSING ABOUT HALF OF THE ANNEXATIONS THAT THEY USE -- TO IT'S CRITICAL TO THE ORDERLY GROWTH AND LOGICAL BOUNDARIES AND THE EFFICIENT PROVISION OF LOCAL SERVICES. COLUSA DID AN ANNEXATION DUE TO WATER CONCERNS THE WHICH BECAUSE THE CITY OF COLUSA SOMEA REVENUE SHORTAGES. AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN CONTRA COSTA LEFT APROVED EIGHT INHABITED ANNEXATIONS ONE WAS AN UNINCORPORATED ISLAND CONSIDERED A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WITH ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES RELATED TO THOSE DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. AND NO FUNDING -- TO MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS SIMILAR STORIES AND KERN SAN MATTEO CENTER AND OTHER COUNTIES.

THE THREE BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER BELIN MR MEISTER -- JUSTO SO WE'RE WE'RE THIS IS -- THE BILL THAT WOULD -- TAKE MONEY FROM THE E. RAF. THE PROPERTY TAX. AND AND IT BE BACK FILLED BY THE GENERAL FUND IS THAT CORRECT. YES SENATOR OF IT'S IT'S THE SAME EXACT FORMULA THAT WAS USED OF FOR THE FOUR INCORPORATED CITIES -- IT YES IT WOULD IT WOULD -- AS THE CHAIR AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED -- THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TAKEN AWAY FROM A FROM CITIES -- IN THIS THE THE I THINK THE COST OF THIS BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIX IT. AND THERE THE OTHER OTHER CITIES THERE'D BE ON OUT THAT ARE. IN THE SAME BOAT THAT WE KNOW OF OR WOULD THEY BE MORE CITIES. THE ON OUT OF THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FORTY CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT WILL BE AFFECTED THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY. BY THIS AND WILL THIS WILL REMEDY. THOUGH SOMEWHAT HELPFUL. ABSOLUTELY WOULD HELP ALL OF THE ROOMS WORRISOME OKAY IT DIDN'T INCREASES WAS REMINDED US SAN JOSE THE CITY OF SAN JOSE I BELIEVE TO THE SAME THING AN EXTRA NUMBER OF VIOLENCE AND I THINK THE IT WAS FOR AROUND. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SOME THEY LOST WHEN SB EIGHTY NINE WENT THROUGH SO THAT THAT WOULD BE RESTORED GOING FORWARD TO THAT SAN JOSE CA. LIKE -- THIS IS HE WRAPPED ALREADY WRAPPED TICKETS. TO THE CITY COFFERS AND THAT'S BACK FILLED BY THE STATE YES YES SIR. YEAH -- HAS THERE BEEN ANY OPPOSITION. OF FROM GROUPS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RATHER EDUCATIONAL GROUPS NO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER WE KNOW LIKE TURNED OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR ONE IS FRESHER. SO YOUR USER. HEY THERE YOU GO. IT IS HE OF YES REDUCE AFTER A CALL BUT IF I WOULD HAVE. READ THIS BEFORE OUR PHONE CALL LAST NIGHT AND IT GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE. INPUT BUT SB EIGHTY NINE WHICH IS BEING CORRECTED HERE ARE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WAS NEFARIOUS AND IT WAS. A BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT JUST WIPED OUT A LOT OF US. INCLUDING THAT THE COUNTY OF ORANGE SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHETHER THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE COUNTY OF ORANGE RIGHT. ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE BILL LINES THIRTY ONE THROUGH -- FORTY THERE THERE'S A REFERENCE THERE AND I'M JUST WONDERING YOUR YOU KEPT USING THE TERM CITIES. BUT IS THE COUNTY OF ORANGE BEING -- ADDRESSED AS WELL BECAUSE WE TOOK -- AS IT SAYS IN THE BILL OF FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR YET. TO OUR GENERAL FUND IT WAS IT WAS AWFUL AND THEY PUT ME IN LITIGATION I WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE TIME AT IS TO GOVERNOR BROWN AND IT'S JUST NOT A PLEASANT TIME. IT IS SENATOR ODENKIRK WITH LAWYER CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE THE ANSWER IS NO WE DON'T BELIEVE THE BILL AT ALL AFFECTS THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IN FACT THE COUNTY WARRANTS DID. GET A FIX I THINK IT WAS A SENATOR CORY A BILL NUMBER THREE FOUR YEARS AGO AND AND THAT THAT IS NOT A TOUCH BY THIS PROPOSAL -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A CAREER AS YOU SAID A QUREIA BILL. I BELIEVE WAS SENATOR KOREA -- IT THINK IT WAS PROBABLY FOUR YEARS AGO. WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH OF A FIX OKAY. OUR YARD AND JUST KIND OF CURIOUS -- MAYBE MAYBE STAFF TO GET BACK TO ME TO LET ME KNOW -- IF -- IF IF IF AT LEAST. EQUITY HAS BEEN PROVIDED BECAUSE I I I SUPPORTED EVERYONE OF SENATOR ROSS BILLS -- EVERY YEAR WHILE I WAS STILL SUPERVISOR AND EVERY YEAR THEY WENT THROUGH. THE LEGISLATURE GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GOVERNOR BROWN BE TOLD THEM IT WASN'T UNTIL. TWO YEARS AGO THAT THAT LIKE ON THE THIRD ITERATION THAT THE GOVERNOR FINALLY SIGNED THE BILL. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- AT THE END OF THE DAY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IS. TREATED AS EQUITABLY AS ALL THE CITIES AND AND WE HAD SEVEN WORKING HARD FOR THE FOUR CITIES. IN IN YOUR DISTRICT -- TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THEIR BILLS. I JUST BRING THAT UP RICHARD SHARPE WE CANNOT THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT I DO WANT TO SAY THEY WERE. NOT TO BE SENT IN MY DISTRICT -- THEY WORD SENATOR ROTH'S WITCHES ON NEIGHBORING -- COMMUNITY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY DONE THE WORK OF ANNEXING. THE PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THAT FUNDING FROM THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY -- THE LEGISLATION THE TRAILER BILL WAS WRITTEN THEY NO LONGER RECEIVE THIS. SO IT IS. AND WE DO HAVE A LIST OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PLUS CITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT BECAUSE OF THIS I'M WITH YOU AND AND IT AFFECTED CITIES THAN NEXT AFTER. TWO THOUSAND FOUR AND AFTER TWO THOUSAND FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. REFINANCE STAR BANKRUPTCY DEBT. AND THE WILL OF THE BOOK THE BORROWERS WANTED AS A DEDICATED INCOME STREAM SO WE USE THE VLF REVENUE STREAM AS THE SOURCE TO PAY THE BONDS. AND SO IN THE INDENTURE WHEN WE REFUNDED REFINANCED WE HAD TO SAY WERE STILL USING THE BOS SOURCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS OUR PROPERTY TAXES GOING IN THERE BECAUSE IT ALL BEEN. CHANGED BECAUSE OF A SWAB THAT OCCURRED DURING THE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER MINISTRATIONS SO IT WAS A CONTRIVANCE. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN OUR MONEY OUR FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS GOT CAUGHT UP IN SB EIGHTY NINE AND IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US -- SO IT WAS EXTREMELY AWKWARD BECAUSE ALL WE WERE DOING WAS MEETING -- A BONDHOLDER REQUIREMENT WHEN WE REFINANCE SO WE KIND OF GOT CAUGHT IN THIS UGLY MASS. AND ND WHO KNOWS IF IT WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT -- BUT IT WAS -- NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE SO I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOW THAT WERE HEALING ALL THESE WOUNDS. TECH IS WE DO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION LAST WEEK ABOUT WHY IN COURT Y. Y. ANNEX PARCELS IN IRELAND'S IF YOU'RE GOING. TO YOU KNOW HAVE A NET NEGATIVE SO AFTER EVER DOING THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IF YOU KNOW THE DAY THAT THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IS ALSO BEEN. TREATED AS EQUITABLY AS EVERYONE ELSE ON OUR SUPPORT THE BILL I'VE I'VE BEEN THERE I JUST. WHAT I MAKE SURE I'M ONE OF THOSE NO BETTER NO WORSE EVERYBODY ELSE SHOULD BE TO SEE TREATED THE SAME WAY?

JENNA CRLSON ACTING LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK GOOD TO SEE. SENATOR THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION FRANCHISE TAX BOARD USES THAT MANY MANY SOURCES OF INFORMATION. TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL NON COMPLIANCE. AND THE PUBLIC MEDIA IS ONE OF THEM. SO WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED JUST ON ONE'S BUT THIS PARTICULAR NONPROFIT BUT I'M I'M WONDERING -- IT IS -- WAVE MAYBE IN IT OR MAYBE A READY IN CODE IS -- WITH A WHOLE. THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OR WITH THE FACT THAT MAYBE THERE'S FRAUD INVOLVED. WITH THAT REMOVED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THERE ARE STATUTES TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT. IF THERE IS A LACK OF DON'T ACTIVE INTENT. FOR A CONTRIBUTION. THAT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR THE DISALLOWANCE OF A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTION SO. IF IF IF ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS EITHER -- ADMITTED GUILT AND DOESN'T GO THROUGH TRIAL BAR IS FOUND GUILTY AFTER TRIAL -- AND THEY MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS AND DOUBTS NOW THE DEEMED FRAUDULENT THEN WITH THIS BILL BE NECESSARY OR OR OR OR THE CURRENT. PROCESS SEES ALREADY GOING TO SATISFY WHAT WE WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO HERE. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND THAT REALLY SPEAKS MORE THE INTENT -- UNDER CURRENT LAW FRANCHISE TAX BOARD DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO CORRECT THE TAX BENEFIT OR REVERSE THE TAX BENEFIT THAT WAS TAKEN THAT DID NOT MEET THE UNDERLYING CODE. SO THERE'S NOT A BILL OF TODAY WHERE YOU HAVE A TWENTY YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY SO THEN. I'M I'M JUST YOU KNOW I WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THIS IS THIS IS THE TOPIC OF THE DAY AND IRONICALLY MR SINGERS CONSTITUENT OF MINE -- BUT JUST YOU KNOW I'M FRUSTRATED BY IT ALL BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO A BILL EVERY TIME WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT IT'S READY. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT WOULD. TAKE CARE OF EGREGIOUS EVENTS LIKE THIS.

MEDINA THANK YOU SO MUCH WE ALWAYS ENJOY A HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN IS READY IN COMMITTEE MISTAKE OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN BACK A FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. A PROUD TO BE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE. I FIRST MET A MANY OF THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WITH THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I LEARNED THAT THERE WERE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS ALMOST ALL OF THEM HIRED AS TEMPORARY WORKERS. WORKING ALMOST AS DAY LABORERS WHERE THEY HAD TO SHOW UP EACH DAY GET IN LINE SEE WHETHER THEY WERE CHOSEN THEY WERE WORKING UNDER SOME OF THE MOST OPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS I HAVE EVER HEARD. OF INCLUDING -- PREGNANT WOMEN HAVING TO LIFT HEAVY CRATES NO PROTECTION AGAINST EXTREME HEAT NO REST PERIODS -- THOUGH THEY WERE SHOCKING CONDITIONS AND THE WORKER STARTED TO COME OUT AND SPEAK TO THOSE CONDITIONS. OVER THE YEARS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT THESE WAREHOUSE OPERATORS MAKE PROMISES TO BRING JOBS TO AREAS THAT BADLY NEED THEM AND THEN INSTEAD OF USING THOSE TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO CREATE GOOD JOBS. AND TO HELP BRING FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY THEY ARE USED -- TO CREATE LOW WAGE TEMPORARY JOBS WHERE WORKERS ARE OFTEN PAID A GROUP PIECE RATE AND MAKE VERY LITTLE MONEY WHERE THERE'S HIGHER. RATES OF WAGE THEFT AND WORKER INJURIES THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLE IT IS TRANSPARENCY TELL US THE KINDS OF JOBS YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE -- BE CLEAR WHAT THE DEAL IS YOU'RE MAKING WITH THE LOCAL -- WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND BE TRUE TO YOUR WORK THAT'S ALL THIS BILL ASKS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH.

TO ENSURE THAT RETAILERS -- ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND ARE PROVIDING THE RIGHT KINDS OF JOBS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH WITH MANET'S WONDERING WHO THE HELL ON THIS MORETTI IS.

MORNING MR SURELY IS OVER THERE WITH CAL CHAMBER WITH POLICE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION AFTER THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHTS ORGANIZED. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHASING AND SALAS REPRESENTING THE CITY MARINO VALLEY -- WE HAVE A CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL AS WE DID THE PRIOR VERSION THAT WAS VETOED WITH ME I HAVE THE VICE MAYOR -- VICTORIA BACCHUS TO MAKE A BRIEF FOR A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS IF YOU WILL THANK YOU GREAT. ADVICE VERY WELCOMING COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO BE WITH US YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES ME ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AND I REALLY -- I'M HONORED TO BE HERE THINK OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE STATEMENT PLEASE -- DISTRIBUTION CENTERS PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND CALIFORNIA AND HELP SOLIDIFY OUR STATE'S ROLE AS THE GATEWAY FOR COMMERCE. SINGLING THEM OUT ONLY MAKES IT MORE COMPELLING FOR THESE BUSINESSES TO BUILD IN OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA. DOESN'T DEMAND THIS LEVEL OF SCRUTINY WITH OTHER PROMINENT INDUSTRY SUCH AS HIGH TECH FILM SPORTS ARENAS AND ENTERTAINMENT VENUES. CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL DISCLOSURE AB FORTY FIVE CONTAINS POISON PILL PROVISIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE BUSINESS INFORMATION THAT IS STRICTLY PROPRIETARY. MY STAFF SURVEYED SEVERAL OF ORINDA VALLEY'S LOGISTIC COMPANIES MANY ARE FORTUNE. FIVE HUNDRED AND INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES WILL CONTINUE TO CONFIRM THAT THIS INFORMATION WOULD NEVER BE PROVIDED FOR PUBLICATION THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD ONLY MAKE THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IN TEXAS AND MEXICO SEEM. THAT MUCH MORE ALLURING. MORENO VALLEY ASSERTS THAT THE JOBS CREATED BY THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY BRING ECONOMIC STABILITY TO FAMILIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE SUFFER FROM UNEMPLOYMENT. ACCORDING TO UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TOTAL PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT IN THE CITY INCREASED BY SIXTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY JOBS. OF WHICH THE TRANSPORTATION WAREHOUSING AND UTILITIES CATEGORY REPRESENT MORE THAN 61% OF NEW JOBS CREATED. MOST IMPRESSIVE IS THAT MARINO VALLEY'S AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME INCREASED FROM SIXTY THREE THOUSAND TO OVER SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE HAVE WITNESSED OTHER STATES OFFERING INCENTIVES TO LURE COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. PLEASE DO NOT LIMIT THE FEW TOOLS AT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN UTILIZE TO TRACK JOBS SO THAT OUR RESIDENTS CAN HAVE A PROSPEROUS ECONOMIC FUTURE. A VOTE FOR A BEFORE EIGHTY FIVE IS A VOTE FOR TEXAS AND MEXICO. IN CLOSING AS MAYOR PRO TEM OF THE CITY THAT S A TWENTY FIRST LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA WE URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. BETTER MAYOR PRO TEM THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE TWO OF YOU STAY THERE -- HERE AS WE PROCEED WITH ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANYONE ELSE COMPORT. COMING LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JACK YOU'RE GONNA BE HELPFUL YOU CALIFORNIA'S CITIES EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS COMMITTEE HEARD IN PAST -- SENATOR GLAZERS SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WHICH REALLY DEALT WITH THE KEY ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH WERE HOUSES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS THE SALES TAX AGREEMENTS AND BASICALLY PROHIBITED THESE. AGREEMENTS GOING FORWARD -- WE SEE -- WITH THIS BILL ELLIS -- CONTINUING THE MEMBERS HAVE GONE OUT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT CONTINUE TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL SET OF HOOPS AND HURDLES ON ONE TYPE OF OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS OPPOSED TO OTHERS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK SB FIVE THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM IN THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS CAN BE LAST CALL FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED LAST CALL. AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE AND A TURN OVER THE SEVEN MEMBER TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ANY COMMENTS T BEFORE YOU DO I DO THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS YOU ARE WORKING ON THESE AMENDMENTS. TO BE ABLE TO STRIKE A COMPROMISE -- IN I I DON'T WANT. TO PUT WORDS INTO THE MADAM PROTEINS -- MAYOR PRO TEM'S MOUTH BUT I THINK THAT -- YOU REALLY BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON THIS BILL AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADVANCE WORK ON MANY OF THE CONCERNS AND LIKE I SAY ALL THAT MANY OF THE CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THAT DATA. AS BEING REFERRED TO IT MAY NOT GO FAR ENOUGH I GET IT -- BUT WOULD LIKELY TO TURN OVER THE SUMMER NUMBER AFTER THAT ISSUE. I WANT TO THANK CAL CHAMBER IN THE CALIFORNIA REAL TALE RETAILERS ASSOCIATION FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND GOING NEUTRAL. WHEN IT THANK THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF FRESNO WE BRAND? FOR CHANGING POSITIONS AND SUPPORTING THE BILL. AB FOR EIGHTY FIVE WILL INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND SEEKS TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. TO HOLD AREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES THAT RECEIVE TAXPAYER FUNDED SUBSIDIES ACCOUNTABLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. A SIMILAR I JUST ON THE ISSUE OF THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT. ON THOSE AMENDMENTS THOSE ARE WHERE YOU WERE TRYING TO FOCUS RIGHT ON NOT A BILLING DEAN SOME OF THOSE AMENDMENTS IN REGARD TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS OR TO DANCE AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT. CAN SATISFY EVERYONE BUT I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS AND IN THE MIDST OF PLEASE IF YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION A PANTS THAT WAS THE PURPOSE CORRECT THANK YOU SO MUCH. A PLEASE MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THESE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE GETTING TO BE QUITE INTERESTING ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE WATCHING THE SYSTEMIC CHANGES IN OUR IN OUR SOCIETY WITH THE TRANS AS THEY THEY GENERATE SALES TAX. AND THAT'S GENERATED BY INTERNET SALES OVERSEEING THESE. DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE CITIES WHERE THE WAREHOUSES LOCATED. A GENERATING A LOT OF SALES TAX REVENUES -- BUT IT ISN'T GOING TO PERHAPS THE CITY WHERE THE PURCHASER AND SO -- THERE THERE'S A LOT OF RETAIL ACTIVITY IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT A NEIGHBORING COUNTIES GETTING THE SALES TAX. AND I THINK I IT IT PUTS -- AN AWKWARD COMPOUNDED INTO -- CITIES QUé AND COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER TO GET THESE WAREHOUSES SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT -- SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY ONE BY GLAZER WAS A GOOD. BILL AS WELL -- BUT IF WE'RE ALL GONNA START COMPETING FOR SALES TAX GENERATORS WE KIND OF GET BLINDED. TO WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND I THINK ONCE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES REALIZES THAT A LOT OF THEIR MEMBERS ARE NOT GETTING THE REVENUES THEY SHOULD BE GETTING. BECAUSE IT'S BEING. CENTERED SOMEWHERE ELSE -- THEN THEN IMAGES TO A BALLOT MEASURE. AND THEN ALL THE CITIES THAT GAVE SUBSIDIES ARE GONNA FIND THEMSELVES. LOSING THE SALES TAX REVENUE THEREFORE PART COMING UP NEGATIVE PAYING OUT MORE IN SUBSIDIES THAN THEY'RE GETTING AND SALES TAX BENEFITS I'M. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL I APPRECIATE CERTAIN THE LABOR COMPONENT BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED LONG TERM OR WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE CITIES -- SHOULD. THE WHOLE DYNAMIC CHANGED BY DEVELOPING AGENCIES DISAPPEARED AND AND YOU KNOW I CAN'T WE GIVE I GAVE A LIST ALREADY HAVE ALL THE THE FUNNY THING IS TO GO ON A GOVERNMENT WHERE PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE DOING A GREAT THING FOR THEIR CITY. BUT REALIZE AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT THAT THEY HAD A YOU KNOW SALESMAN IN TOWN WHO MADE LOTS OF MONEY. BACK TO THERE'S ONE GUY. THAT WAS DISCLOSED AFTER WE WE'VE FINISHED SB FIVE THIRTY ONE THAT WAS GETTING A PERCENTAGE OF THE SALES TAX FOR ALL THIS CITIES THAT HE WAS ABLE. TO CONVINCE THE VISION PUT WAREHOUSES AND SO HE'S GOT THIS INCOME STREAM THAT'S JUST. IN THE MILLIONS JUST BECAUSE YOU PUT IT IN THERE CONTRACTORS JUST LIKE ALL MY GOODNESS THERE'S THIS IS THIS IS SO WRONG. SO -- MISTER -- WELL THE LEAGUE OF CITIES DâN YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT THIS WENT TOO FAR AND I I I'M NOT SEEING IT I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. HELPING ME -- BECAUSE I I THINK DISCLOSING TO YOUR RESIDENCE THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING THAT THE CITIZENS OF THAT CITY YOU'RE GONNA UNDERWRITE A PARTICULAR. BUSINESS THEY SHOULD BE FULLY AWARE OF OF WHAT IT IS IF THEY'RE GIVING UP A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE OF THEIR TAXES SO WHAT AM I MISSING. ZERO NINETY THREE ENTITIES YOURSELF PLEASE -- ALONG WITH YOUR TITLE. THANK YOU SENATOR OGDEN CARRIED WITH THE WE GET CALIFORNIA CITIES. ON ALL BACK TO SB FIVE THIRTY ONE SENATOR YOU TALKED ABOUT SALES TAXES I MEAN THE SB FIVE THIRTY ONE DEAL SQUARELY WITH THAT ISSUE OF SALES TAXE INTERNET SALES. AND ACTUALLY THE LEAGUE IS -- SUPPORTING AYE I GUESS SORT OF SPONSORING FIVE THIRTY ONE BECAUSE WE HAD A DAY INTENSIVE POLICY DISCUSSION WITHIN THE LEAGUE ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT SOME OF THE THE THE THE GROWTH OF INTERNET AND SOME OF THE ISSUES AND SO. THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WOULD BE AND THESE AGREEMENTS GOING FORWARD WE SUPPORT THAT BUILDS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THIS ISSUE IF YOU TAKE THAT BILL WOULD PUT THAT BILL ASIDE AND SAY THAT GOES THROUGH THE GOVERNOR SIGNS IT. AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE WE HAVE IN A WAREHOUSE SCHEMA WHERE A CITY WITH A WAREHOUSE IN THIS INSTANCE GO THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS AND HURDLES THAT TAT THIS BILL REQUIRES. THIS BILL REQUIRES UNDER EXISTING LAW IF YOU HAVE GIVEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN OF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN WHAT YOU GIVE THAT INSTEAD OF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REPORT EVERY FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL REQUIRES MUCH MORE DETAIL RELATED TO A WAREHOUSE AND ALSO REQUIRES ANNUAL PUBLIC HEARINGS IN ANNUAL REPORTS REPORTS TO GO BUSINESS AND OTHER THINGS BUT NOT KNOW WHETHER -- ENTITY HOUSE TO DO IN FACT I THINK IT PROBABLY GOES FURTHER THAN THE STATE'S WHEN GOKU'S GIVES OUT A CALIFORNIA COMPETES CREDITS. I DON'T THINK THERE HAVE AN ANNUAL PUBLIC HEARINGS ON ON THERE IT'S AND SO IT GOES TO FOUR AND ENDED IT SINGLES OUT THESE COMMUNITIES. THE SALES TAX ISSUE WE WOULD ARGUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THERE -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES OUGHT TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE USING THEIR OWN REVENUES. THE IN A AND I'LL JUST ADD THOUGH JUST I THINK IT'S CLEAR. THERE'S A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENTER -- GLAZIERS BILL -- AS WELL AS THIS BILL THIS BILL IS NOT JUST FOCUS ON SALES TAX SALES TAXES FOCUS ON SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WHICH IS GLAZERS BILL -- AND THIS BILL IS ON OTHER TYPES OF SUBSIDIES SO IT'S THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT. PERSON NEVER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AT ALL. SO I AM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT REPRESENTS THE CITY OF MORENO VALLEY AS WELL AS THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE. AND THE CITY OF PARIS -- AND I'VE. PRESENT THIS BILL BECAUSE I AGREE. WITH CENTER MORE LOCK THAT THE CITIZENS OF A COMMUNITY SHOULD VERY WELL KNOW WHERE THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING. I I I BELIEVE THAT. ALSO  THINK CENTER MORE LIKE SAID THAT MANY TIMES WAREHOUSES COMING IN AND YOU COMMUNITY MAKE PROMISES THAT ARE NOT. A DELIVERED ON JOBS OR THE REVENUE THAT THEY'RE THEY WOULD CREATE OR THE KIND OF JOBS THAT THEY CREATE. AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK THIS WEEK WE NEED THIS BILL I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- THE CITIZENS DESERVE TO KNOW WHERE THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT THANK YOU SO MUCH THE NUMBER WE DO HAVE A QUESTION BY -- MISTER HURTS SENATOR -- FOLLOWING UP ON A QUESTIONINGS BY SENATOR MORE LOCKED. AB THE SOLUTION. TO ALTERNATIVES HERE. IS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE DANCING AROUND THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS BRADLEY BURNS. WE'VE CREATED TAX STRUCTURE CENTERS I MEAN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER TRIED TO DEAL WITH THIS AND WASN'T SUCCESSFUL -- BECAUSE WE INCENTIVIZE BIG BOX RETAIL IN. BIG CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES STEP SMALL CITIES AROUND OF TO GET THE BENEFIT OF THIS EXTRA PENNY ON SALES TAX OR AUTO MALLS AND THE LIKE. IS IT A HOUSING WE TRIED TO DO THAT AND COULD WIN THAT. MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST EITHER A ELIMINATE BRADLEY BURNS THAT STOP STOPS THE PROBLEM IN THE IN ITS TRACKS BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO OFFER WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MONEY OR BE DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BEFORE. AND USE THAT BRADLEY BURNS MONEY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A HOUSING PROBLEM WE HAVE BECAUSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WANT THE MONEY. AND THEY'D RATHER TAKE THE MONEY. FOR TO PAY SUBSIDIZED Là SERVICES THAT HOUSING WHICH DOESN'T PROVIDE THE MONEY THAT BIG BOX RETAILERS AUTO MALLS DO SO MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST. TO INDUCE A BILL AND JUST GET READY BRADLEY BURNS AND AND EVERYBODY'S ARGUMENTS WILL CHANGE. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ARGUING WHETHER WITH A REPORT ABOUT THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE TAKEN BUT THE PROBLEM IS. NOW THERE'S BRADLEY BURNS REVENUE STREAM WORKS AND IT'S CREATED IT UNBELIEVABLE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NO I DON'T THINK IT'S ACHIEVED THE DELIVERABLES AND SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE AND CREATED THIS COMPETITIONS AMONG CITIES SO. A CO AUTHOR THAT BILL YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE LAST QUICK COMMENT IF YOU I MEAN IF YOU SEE YOURSELF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHASING AND SOLVE US AGAIN REPRESENTING THE CITY OF MARINO VALLEY. AND WE UNDERSTAND SIR MORE LOCKS CONCERNS AND AS NOTED ON ITEM SIX IN THE ANALYSIS THE PRIOR VETO MESSAGE SUGGEST THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. CURRENT LAW HAS ABOUT FOURTEEN PROVISIONS WERE YOU HAVE TO REPORT UNDER FIFTY THREE ZERO EIGHT THREE S. NUMBER JOBS IMPACT YOU HAVE AN ANNUAL IMPACT STUDY. AND WHILE I KNOW SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO KNOWS THIS I WOULD ONLY SUGGEST THAT THE BRADLEY BURNS IS THE ONLY UNIFORM -- REVENUE SOURCE COME TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I WOULD PROBABLY RATHER HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DISPARITY PROPERTY TAX SHARES AS A RESULT OF AB. EIGHT AND THEN WE WOULD REALLY HAVE A FIVE CONVERSATION BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S PERHAPS FOR ANOTHER DAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. CENTERS FOR WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT SERVICE TAXES SO -- HE'S GONNA GIVE BACKS ON THAT AS WELL. SO -- WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR ABOUT YOU CLEAR FOR YOU THE AMENDMENTS. THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED. THE LADY SIN I MAY THE MORNING. A SERAPH LOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS -- WERE NEGOTIATED WITH THE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE RETAILER CITY OF FRESNO THERE WAS AN ISSUE THAT THE VICE MAYOR RAISED ABOUT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SOME OF THE DISCLOSURES AROUND JOB QUALITY. WE WORKED WITH IT THE CHAMBER AND THE RETAILERS AND OTHER OPPOSITION TO COME UP WITH. MORE AGGREGATED SO RATHER THAN ASKED FOR THE SPECIFIC WAGES FOR SPECIFIC JOBS IT IS NOW WAGE SCALES WHICH IS MORE AKIN TO WHAT CALIFORNIA COMPETES ASK. FOR BENEFITS AND WELL RATHER WE HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL BILL WHICH WAS VETOED LAST YEAR SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT BILL OF AND THAT THE VETO MESSAGE THAT GOVERNOR BROWN HAD -- THE HE WE ASK FOR THE SPECIFIC VALUE OF THE BENEFIT PACKAGE AND SO THIS IS THAT IS LANGUAGE IS BEEN TAKEN OUT AND IT'S MORE GENERALIZED WHETHER BENEFITS ARE OFFERED. AND ALSO ANOTHER PIECE WAS WE WANTED TO MAKE IT CLEAR AT THE REQUEST OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THIS DOESN'T. ABROGATE OR CHANGE ANY EXISTING CONTRACTS IT IS ONLY GOING FORWARD [inaudible] OKAY SO [inaudible] SO YOU'RE. STILL REQUIRING THE WAGE. GAIL ASIAN THE SKILL OKAY THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME YES AND WHETHER IT'S TEMPORARY FOR ME I I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE BILL -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I HOPE THAT WE DON'T WATER THAT DOWN -- BECAUSE I THINK AS OF FORMER ALL. TEEN AGE -- WAREHOUSEMAN. OF TWO GOT PAID VERY LITTLE. WHEN I DID THE WORK AND -- HAD SOME UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE THERE OR I GOT. A LAID OFF -- JUST ON I DIDN'T HAVE ANY KNOWS THE JUST SAID YOU'RE GONE. THEY DID A KIND OF IN A FUNNY WAY THE THE GOT THE BOSS SAID. YOU KNOW -- THE THREE STOOGES AND I SAID EVERYBODY. THEY HAD A MEETING OF ALL THE THE STOCK BOYS IN THE WAREHOUSE WHEN HE SAID YEAH. HE SAID OKAY I WANT YOU TO LINE AND SAY MOELLER AND CURLY SO USE MOELLER AND CURLY. HE SAID YOU KNOW I LIKE CURLY SO YOU CURLY'S OR STAY IN. THE MOST ON THE LARRY SH YOU'RE GONE. AND I HAPPEN TO BE A MODEL. SO THAT'S HOW I GOT LAID OFF SO I THINK I TAKE CARE OF YOU KNOW WATCH IT WATCHING -- THE WAGES AND HAVING GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO MAKE SURE. THEY BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT -- SPECIALLY THE WORKERS THAT WORK IN THOSE FACILITIES -- IS VERY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL. AND YOUR MOTIVATION FOR DOING IT. OUR LEAD MOTION FOR THE BILL.

BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. THERE IS AFTER DIEM GOOD START HERE HEY SEE THERE YOU GO. THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. HER EIGHT WHAT WE NEEDED AT SEVENTH INNING STRETCH FOR A MINUTE RIGHT -- CRYSTAL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING ME AND AND GUIDING ME WITH THIS BILL THIS IS A TECHNICAL BILL DEALING WITH DEALING WITH THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF TWENTY YEARS FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO COLLECT ON AN OUTSTANDING. WITH THAT I I WILL TURN IT OVER TO JOSEPH BOILS WHO IS A TAX ATTORNEY FROM LOS ANGELES AREA WHO CAN SPEAK TO THE BILL A LITTLE BIT MORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO LIMóN WELCOME TO COMMITTEE SIR IF YOU DON'T MIND ENTITIES YOURSELF FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN SANDERS I'M JOSEPH BOILS ON THE CALIFORNIA A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT AND ATTORNEY. PRACTICING THE ART OF TAX LAW LOS ANGELES -- FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE HAS PROVIDED A TEN YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE COLLECTION OF FEDERAL TAXES CALIFORNIA DIDN'T HAVE A STATURE LIMITATIONS ON THE COLLECTION OF INCOME TAXES. UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A TWENTY YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS -- WHICH I I TRIED LEADERS THE LONGEST STRETCH LIMITATIONS OF IN THE STATE THE COUNTRY TWICE THE FEDERAL LAW. BUT THE MECHANICS OF THE FEDERAL STATE STATUTEARE DIFFERENT UNDER THE FEDERAL STATUTE. THERE'S A TEN YEAR STATUTE LIMITATIONS ON EACH AND EVERY ASSESSMENT OF TAX. UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LAW THERE'S A TWENTY YEAR STATURE LIMITATIONS ON EACH TAX YEAR. IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS OF TAX WITHIN ONE TAX YEAR THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK BEGINS TO RUN FROM THE LAST ASSESSED TAX. SO THOSE WILL NOT LOOK DOES THE MECHANICS. BUT THERE'S A FLAW IN IN THE MECHANICS AND THAT. UP THE THE THE STATUTE CURRENTLY DEFIANCE A TAX LIABILITY TO INCLUDE INTEREST PENALTIES AND FEES AND COSTS. WELL. INTEREST ACCRUES DAILY SO IF IF THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK BEGINS TO RUN FROM THE LAST ASSESSED AMOUNT. INTEREST ACCRUES DAILY THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK BEGINS EVERY DAY. SIMILARLY THE THE IT THE FTV ROUTINELY CHARGES FEES AND COSTS FOR COLLECTION THERE'S A EIGHTEEN DOLLAR LEAN FEE THERE'S A THIRTY DOLLAR OR FIFTY DOLLAR -- FEE ON INSTALLMENT AGREEMENTS ALL OF THOSE FEES AND COSTS RESTART THE TWENTY YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FOR THE TWENTY OR STATURE WOULD LIMITATION BECOMES ILLUSORY. THIS BILL IS THE TECHNICAL CORRECTION THAT TO FIGHT THE THAT REDEFINES THE AMOUNTS THAT RESTART THE STATUTE AS TAX ONLY. SO IF THERE'S IF THERE'S A NEW ASSESSMENT OF TAX THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK BEGINS TO RUN AGAIN. INTEREST FEES COST THOSE ITEMS WILL NO LONGER RESTART THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK THE TECHNICAL CORRECTION AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU DID THE D. FIVE VERY HELPFUL. GREATLY APPRECIATE HER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING COMMITTEE WITH NECESSARY.

TO A SIMILAR GLORIA THIS IS AB. FOR TWENTY THREE WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU THIS A MEMBER. FOR WORKING WITH US. BUT HE IS TAKING ON A BIG ISSUE. IN A CERTAIN FROM THE GROUND UP ON THIS. AS FAR AS A NEW COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION. WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP -- IN WORKING WITH US THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR ON ITEM NUMBER FIVE EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO TAKE YOUR STAFF AS WELL FOR WORKING WITH US -- TO MAKE AG AXLE IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS BILL I WANT TO SAY ON THE RECORD I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THOSE OF WILL BE TAKEN AND SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE. US VERY QUICKLY EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WAS STRUCTURE STANDING WAS AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BOARD AND THEN DIRECTS THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PROGRAM TRANSPARENCY. THE BILL WILL BE RECONSTITUTED TO INCLUDE THAT REPRESENTATION FROM ADDITIONAL SAN DIEGO CITIES AS WELL AS OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU AIDS A CITY WAS A PCD BOARD REPRESENTS OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS EIGHTEEN CITIES HOWEVER UNLIKE OTHER LARGE URBAN -- AIR DISTRICTS THAT OVERSEE A SINGLE COUNTY THE COMPOSITION OF THE A PC BOARD CURRENTLY SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES LOCAL CITIES FROM HAVING A SEAT ON THE BOARD. IS THAT THE BOARD IS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF BOARD MEMBERS OF THE CITY OF COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE AT THE PERSPECTIVES AND INSIGHTS OF OTHER LOCAL AIR POLLUTION SOURCES. THE CIVIC WE CITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THESE EXPERIENCES I THINK WITHIN FOUR BETTER DECISION MAKING EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY THREE WOULD ALSO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY REQUIRING THE BOARD TO AMONG OTHER THINGS CREATE A SEPARATE WEBSITE. APPLY FOR STATEWIDE GRANTS AND FEDERAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- EVALUATE THE PUBLIC COMPLAIN COMMENT PROCESS AND DEVELOP A PLAN FOR COMPREHENSIVE AIR MONITORING A BEFORE TWENTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY DIVERSE COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DAN TALKED FOR IN WITH THE ENVIRONMENT HEALTH COALITION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES. BOARD THANK YOU MISTER GLORY DAY AND WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH OF TWO MINUTES WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH -- CHAIRMAN REQUIRE AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA SAID I AM WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION AND SERVICE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE ERRORS RESOURCES BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH POLLUTION IS SPONSORING THIS BILL -- BECAUSE WE ARE -- TIRED OF HAVING TO HEALTH AND ON OUR MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES CONTINUE UNABATED -- AND WE BELIEVE THAT A CHANGE IN THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BOARD -- REALLY WILL RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND IT REALLY DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR ACTION. THE NEED FOR CHANGE IN REPRESENTATION IS VERY CLEAR THE AIR AIR POLLUTION CONTROL BOARD OF SAN DIEGO IS AN ANOMALY AMONG THE LARGE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE IT'S THE PRODUCT OF A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROVISIONS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED. TO EXAM SAN DIEGO COUNTY FROM HAVING A DIVERSE AND REPRESENTATIVE BOARD WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEED FOR DIRECT ACTION IS CLEAR -- AND THAT THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY IS VERY VERY EVIDENT WE HAVE EXAMPLES SUCH AS THE FACT THAT THE BOARD MINUTES ARE BURIED WITHIN THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- MINUTES AND THEY'RE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC -- ONLINE REQUEST FOR DATA GOAL -- ON RESPONDED -- TO AFTER MULTIPLE REQUESTS -- AND MONITORING DATA FROM THE EXISTING MONITORS TAKES YEARS TO BE PROCESS WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA. OTHER LARGE DISTRICTS HAVE ROBUST PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS SEES AND ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH AUTHENTIC PARTICIPATION FROM IMPACTED COMMUNITIES WE AGREE WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOUR COMMITTEE HAS PROVIDED AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. TO TO DEVELOP THOSE AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU RECALL YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT TO PLEASE COME FORWARD THIS TIME. WE HAVE A SQUISHY.

WITH THE MOST RECENT SETTLEMENT THAT WILL BE GOING TO THE BILL -- ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE FEE ISSUE WHICH WAS OUR REMAINING OUTSTANDING ISSUE -- THAT THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF OUR CONCERNS OF THE PROPOSAL SO. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE -- THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS EFFORTS IN WORKING WITH US NOT LOOK I I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT I THINK THIS IS -- IN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN ALL SIDES -- WANTING TO ADDRESS WANNA TAKE LONGER TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE COUNTY -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THE ALL. AND FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND LOOK FORTY HERE AND SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK AS WELL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND HAVE YOU HANG. THESE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THAT WORKS FOR YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE WHO HAS CONCERNS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORTH THIS TIME. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR OPPOSITION. THIS IS GONNA BE LAST CALL WE'RE GONNA BRING IT. EVER GO HEY DOING. WE HAVE SOME OTHER ACCOUNTS CHAMBER WE ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WHILE THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS IN CONCERT PARTICULARLY AROUND THE ACTIVITIES REQUIRED BY THE BILL OF THE DISTRICT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE [inaudible] LAST CALL. ALL RIGHT HERE AND SEE NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS CONVERSATION PLEASE MR VICE CHAIR. SURE I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION IS PLEASE -- IN IN THE BRIEFING MATERIAL IT. UNDER LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THE SECOND SENTENCE THAT STATE LAW SPELLS OUT THE MEMBERSHIP. OF THESE LOCAL AIR DISTRICT'S GOVERNING BOARDS BUT THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS AND I'M JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW DOESN'T GIVE LIKE A CODE CITATION OF WHERE TO LOOK. BUT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE OF A BOARD SUPPOSED TO BE COMPRISED OF YOU KNOW. AS WE M. DUG INTO THIS ISSUE -- THERE IS NO MAGIC FORMULA -- BUT WE'LL BE HAPPY TO BE TO GET YOU THE CODE SECTION -- BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S THE CODE SECTIONS NOT BUT IF YOU GO TO PAGE TWO OF SIX FIRST PARAGRAPH. OF THE TWENTY ONE SINGLECOUNTY DISTRICT SEVEN HAVE BOARDS WITH CITY REPRESENTATION AND FOURTEEN AND BOARDS WITH ONLY COUNTY SUPERVISORS. SO HERE'S WHERE WE CAME AND I'M GONNA LOOK TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS ISSE AND FEEL FREE. NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S OPEN IN SO -- AND I'M GONNA HAVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIME IN ON THIS AS WELL. THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS DIVERSE DIVERSE IN REGARDS TO ITS AIR RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE REASON WHY WE DO THAT. IS BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE THE INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS AN EXPERT IN THAT ISSUE OF AIR QUALITY ON BOTH BOARDS? SINCE SAN DIEGO ALSO HAS A SEAT ON THE STATE BOARD. ONE SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER BECAUSE OF POPULATION. FIVE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. ONE FROM EACH OF THE FIVE COUNTY BOARD DISTRICTS. THAT WOULD THEN BE APPOINTED BY THE CITY SELECTION COMMITTEE. THE THREE PUBLIC BOARD MEMBERS WOULD BE APPOINTED -- IT COULD BE THROUGH AN AD HOC OF THE COMMITTEE OR THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE OF THAT NEW BOARD. SO AGAIN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND THE COUNTY TO BRING A VARIETY OF VOICES IN. AND THEN ALSO ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC ALSO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THERE IS NO FORMAL DEFINITION -- AND WE WE THINK WE'VE HIT THE SWEET SPOT. NOT SURE EVERYONE IS GOING. TO BE HAPPY AS WITH ANY ISSUE PATTERN OF THIS IN THE NUMBER TO SEE WHAT I MISSED YOU -- COVERED PRETTY WELL MISS JANET INTO FOR THE VICE CHAIR IF I CAN AIDS REFER TO MY WITNESS WHO I THINK CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL BUT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING. FOR I CAN'T WRITE THE CODE SECTION SORRY I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I DO -- KNOW THAT EACH OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS HAS A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION BUT THEY GENERALLY HAVE THE SAME IDEA OF HAVING PUBLIC MEMBERS MEMBERS FROM EACH OF THE CITIES OF OR THE REGION'S WITHIN A COUNTY AND EACH ONE IS COMPRISED DIFFERENTLY SOME HAVE APPOINTEES FROM. THE GOVERNOR FROM ARM TO THE US SENATE PRETENDING FROM THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER THERE'S DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONS FOR EACH ONE OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS BUT ALL OF THEM ARE DIVERSE AND HAVE A HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF COMPOSITION SO THIS ONE IS IN KEEPING WITH -- WITH THOSE OF DISTRICTS AS WELL IF YOU JUST TO PUT IT SUCCINCTLY WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST A REGION IN THE STATE AND YET WE OPERATE CURRENTLY AS ONE OF THE SMALL COUNTIES AND THAT'S NOT WORKING ANY LONGER. NO NO AND I SEE THAT AND I I HAVE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- RESOURCE. ALL ABOARD AN INTENSE I'M LOOKING AT AGAIN THE NO BETTER NO WORSE PHILOSOPHY OF IF WE'RE GONNA FIX SAN DIEGO WHY DON'T WE SET AT A TEMPLATE FOR EVERYBODY. SO WE'RE ALL FOLLOWING THE SAME. FORMAT AND THAT'S SO I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHY JUST THIS DISTRICT IN WHY NOT. YOU KNOW IT'S GIVE THE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE'RE ALL PLAYING ON THE SAME. FIELD. BUT THE WORST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD OUT MILEY THAT ANOTHER GUY -- GALLAGHER GUY TO TAKE ON I'M JUST TRYING TO CARE TAKE CARE OF ALL RIGHT NOW. THAT AGAIN AND TRY TO TAKE CARE OF MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW YEAH I MEAN I I GET THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING -- I THINK THIS PUBLIC FOR SOME ABOVE MY PAY GRADE. WELL THEY WERE GONNA HAVE IKE THIRTY OTHER DISTRICTS COME IN OVERTIME RIGHT DO THE SAME THING SO I'M JUST TRYING. TO LOOK AT IT FROM AN OFFICIAL STANDPOINT IF THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THAN IT SHOULD BE A GREAT IDEA FOR EVERYBODY. YOU SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THAT. WE SHOULD WE SHOULD JUST RESOLVING ALL ACROSS WORK THERE WAS JUST MIKE MIKE WEIR THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MISTER. I THINK WE MAY HAVE A BILL IDEA IN THE MAKING. SO A DOCTOR AMOUNTS. RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE WE ALSO WOULD WELCOME A MOTION ON THIS ISSUE.

WIRED HIGH WIRE I'M MORE LOCK. BELL. I HERTZBERG. FIRST REGARD HER CONDO I NIELSEN [inaudible] WIENER. FOR THANK YOU HAVE A CELL NUMBER A VERY GRATEFUL TO ALWAYS WORK WITH YOU EMERGENCY THE SIMILAR BACK HERE IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO SOME GOOD TAX SIR AL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU DAN. WE HAD. SOME NUMBER CALL ROBERT LOOKS LIKE HE MAY HAVE LEFT THE WE'RE GONNA AT WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT MR OBERNOLTE IS HERE WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN THIS IS AB. SIX TEN AB SIXTEEN IN REGARD TO LOCAL BOND MEASURES. BEFORE MR OBERNOLTE GETS GOING I WANNA. PERSON RECOGNIZED FOR ALL THIS WORK ON A SEPARATE ISSUE AND THAT'S THE ISSUE OF THE BUDGET -- HE'S BEEN LIVING THE DREAM OVER THE PAST MANY MONTHS -- ALONG WITH MISTER MOORE LOCK -- EACH YOUR VICE CHAIRS IN THE RESPECTIVE HOUSES AND JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS A MEMBER FOR ALL THIS WORK. TO MEMBER THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND ITEM SEVEN A. B. SIXTEEN WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CURRENT STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WHEN A BOND IS APPROVED BY VOTERS. THAT THE ABOUT BALLOT -- STATEMENT NEXT TO THE BOX WE CHECK YES OR NO TO VOTE INCLUDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAX INCREASE THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SERVICE THAT BOND. CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT TO BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF DOLLARS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF ASSESSED VALUE. THIS BILL AB SIX TEN WOULD SIMPLY CHANGE THAT TO DOLLARS POORER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF ASSESSED VALUE. THIS IS -- AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR DECREASING VOTER CONFUSION AND HELPING PEOPLE TO DO THE MATH BECAUSE THE AVERAGE HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY WORTH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO -- THIS BILLABLE WHERE HAS OPTED OPPOSITION AND WHAT ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE POINTS IN THE OPPOSITION LETTERS THAT I'M SURE YOU'VE READ. FIRST OF ALL -- THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS MADE THAT THIS ACTUALLY INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION OF ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS TOLD ME EXACTLY WHY THEY FEEL THIS WAY BUT LET ME TELL YOU A SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS ACTUALLY DECREASES VOTER CONFUSION. SO A TYPICAL BY BOB BALLOT MEASURE -- FOR APPROVAL OF NEW BOND MIGHT SAY THAT THIS BOND WILL INCREASE TAXES BY EIGHT CENTS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF ASSESSED VALUE SO PRETEND THAT YOU HAVE A HOUSE THAT'S WORTH. FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HOW WOULD YOU DO THE MATH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR TAX INCREASE WOULD BE. MAKING YOU THINK OF THE STEPS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE I'LL TELL YOU THE MAJORITY OF MY CONSTITUENTS COULD NOT COME UP WITH THOSE STEPS. BUT IF WE JUST SIMPLY EXPRESSED IT IN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS EXCESS VALUE THAT WOULD BE EIGHTY CENTS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS IT'S CLEAR TO PEOPLE IF THEY'RE FOUR HOUSES WORTH. BORDER TO TWENTY THOUSAND THEY WOULD JUST MULTIPLY BY FORD AND TWENTY ANOTHER. CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS THAT AND SOMETIMES IT'S RAISED EXPLICITLY AND SOMETIMES A SAID IMPLICITLY BUT ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. TO GET BONDS APPROVED BY VOTERS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX INCREASE WILL LOOK BIGGER IF WE MULTIPLY BY TEN EXPRESS IT PER THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PERCENT OF PER HUNDRED DOLLARS. HOWEVER I'D LIKE GIVEN THE SERGEANTS OF MATERIALS TO PASS AROUND TO YOU THAT SAYS THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THERE'S A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN THERE WITH CITATIONS. THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE THAT SHOW THAT WHEN VOTERS ARE CONFUSED ABOUT AN ISSUE INCLUDING HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE NO. THE TO VOTE YES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT BY DECREASING VOTER CONFUSION AND MAKING IT MORE CLEAR WHAT'S SOMETHING WILL COST THEM THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE LIKELY TO APPROVE IT. THEN TO DISAPPROVE IT. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. SENT OVER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. LOOKING FOR THOSE FOR IN SUPPORT LAST CALL. WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE WHO'S IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. ROOM CHECKED RESPECT FROM THEIR SPERM OR WOULD LIKE TO COME FOR WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU PLEASE WELCOME. HIS EGO WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT BOTH YOUR HERE IF YOU COULD PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FIRST AND LAST AN ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. THE MORNING REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION PRODUCT WITH SCHOOL HOUSING WE ARE OPPOSED. TO EIGHTY SIX TEN AM WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGE IS UNNECESSARY AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD INCREASE VOTER CONFUSION OF THE QUESTION FOR ME IS REALLY WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHAT IMPROVEMENT WITH THIS REALLY MAKE. WE DO APPRECIATE TRANSPARENCY IN COMMUNICATING VERY CLEARLY WITH VOTERS THE IMPACT THAT A MEASURE MAY HAVE ON THEM THE TAX RATE STATEMENT IN THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE IS A GREAT PLACE TO DO THIS IT CONTAINS A LOT OF VERY. IMPORTANT INFORMATION. IF AB SIX TENNIS PASSED IT WILL BE THE ONLY PLACE THAT I KNOW OF IN THE LAW WHERE WE ARE EXPRESSING -- PROPERTY VALUES PER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS RATHER THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ASSESSED VALUATION VOTERS ARE REQUIRED O DO BASIC MATH IN EITHER CALCULATION AND TO PRECISELY DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED TAX INCREASE FOR THEIR PARTICULAR PROPERTY VALUE. UP BECAUSE OF THIS WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT A THOUSAND DOLLARS ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE CALCULATION AND ANYWAY IT'S THE EXACT SAME MATH PROBLEM -- YOU KNOW FIVE CENTS PER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS UNDER CURRENT LAW OR FIFTY CENTS PER THOUSAND DOLLARS UNDER AB SIX TEN IT'S THE SAME MOUTH. ADDITIONALLY WE DO FEAR THAT MAKING THIS CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE STATEMENT COULD SET A PRECEDENT AND PROP FUTURE CHANGES ON THE BALLOT LABEL. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT SCHOOLS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES ARE FACING IN IMPLEMENTING OTHER RECENT ELECTIONS CODE CHANGES WE DO FEAR THAT SIX TEN COULD CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE. AN EVEN MORE CHALLENGES IN COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR VOTERS ARE FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH GRATEFUL. GOOD MORNING FOR THIS LETTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTY BAMA THE OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I HAD A GOOD SENSE THE PREVIOUS WITNESS WOULD COVER ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE SEEMS TO INSERT VOTER CONFUSION TO IS A TACTIC TAXPAYERS MONEY TO CREATE A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES AND FOR TRYING TO DO ADVOCACY MATH HERE WE SHOULD JUST SAY IT -- SO WEIRD OPPOSITION THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU BOTH OF YOU WE'RE GONNA HAVE -- ONE OF YOU HANGING LIKE WE TYPICALLY DO -- DURING COMMITTEE -- IN CASES QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'RE NOW GOING TO OPEN UP ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TURN IT BACK. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAS SAID AND WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO AGAIN -- IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT THIS INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION NO ONE HAS SAID WHY THEY FEEL THIS INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION I THINK THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. IT DECREASES VOTER CONFUSION. THE ASSERTION WAS MADE THAT IS THE SAME MATH PROBLEM WELL IT'S ACTUALLY NOT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT NUMBERS TO PUSH ON THE CALCULATOR IF YOU USING ONE AND IF YOU CAN'T CONCEPTUALIZE. WHAT NUMBERS TO PUSH THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS WOULD COST YOU? BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT'S THE SAME MATH PROBLEM IN MY BUSINESS. WE HAVE. A LOT OF DATA THAT -- THE THE DETERMINES TO THAT WHEN WE HAVE A NEW CUSTOMER AND WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE THAT CUSTOMER TO BUY OUR PRODUCTS EVERY STEP THAT WE REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMER TO TAKE MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PURCHASE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME IS TRUE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH OF BOND ISSUE IS GOING TO COST YOU SO EVEN IF? A VOTER IN BOTH CASES KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO THEY WOULD HAVE TO PUSH AN EXTRA BUTTON ON THE CALCULATOR TO MAKETHE CALCULATION UNDER THE CURRENT STAY LOCKED. DOWN UNDER THE PROPOSED CHANGES MADE BY A. B.. SIX TEN AND ABOUT WHAT LEGAL LASTLY JUST ONE LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- THE MORE TRANSPARENCY THAT WE HAVE WITH VOTERS I THINK -- THE BETTER -- PROBABLY ONE MORE SEARCH THAT WAS MADE WAS THE THE POINT THAT CURRENT STATE LAW USUALLY EXPRESSES VALUATIONS IN TERMS OF DOLLARS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT S TRUE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PLACES AND STATE LAW THAT THAT'S TRUE. BUT THAT I NOT A PUBLIC FACING PORTION OF THE STATE LAW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REQUIRED BALLOT LANGUAGE AND SO IT'S REALLY APPLES AND ORANGES TO SAY. THAT -- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE CONVENTION IS IN STATE LAW AND WHAT WE PUT ON THE BALLOT WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE. YOU SO MUCH TO SOMEONE WE'D LIKE TO GET OPEN UP FOR THE COMMITTEE MISTER VICE CHAIR PLEASE SHARE -- I I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS IN THOUSANDS -- ALREADY FIVE KIND OF FASCINATED BY THE BILL THAT THAT IT THAT WERE SAYING IT'S AN HUNDREDS -- BECAUSE MOST OF THE REPORTS THAT WE PUT OUT IS A GOVERNMENT -- WILL WILL REFLECT THAT IS IS IN THOUSANDS OF WILL DROP THREE THREE DIGITS -- BUT IOWA WHEN I WHEN I WAS TREASURER I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSISTING THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THEIR BOND MEASURES. AND SO YOU GET TO LEARN SOME OF THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS AND I'M SORRY SENATOR HERTZBERG ISN'T HERE BUT IDEAS FOR BILLS YOU KNOW -- WHAT WHAT USUALLY HAPPEN IS BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD TO DO A BALLOT MEASURE THEY COULDN'T SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY TO ADD TO IT ANALYZE HOW TO PUT THIS TOGETHER? THE BOND TOGETHER SO USUALLY -- WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MY COUNTY -- A BOND UNDERWRITER WOULD COME IN AND AND THEY WOULD PAY FOR THE POLLING AND THEY WOULD PAY FOR ALL THE PRELIMINARY WORK AND THEY WOULD THE AT THE POLLING WOULD BE LIKE THIS -- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD PAY TEN DOLLARS PER. THOUSAND OR TWENTY DOLLARS PER THOUSAND OR THIRTY DOLLARS PER. THOUSAND AND THEN THEY COME BACK TO THE POLL RESULTS AND IT WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE MAGIC NUMBERS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER THOUSAND SO THEN THEY LOOK AT THAT SAYS VALUE. IN THE IN THE IN THE DISTRICT IMAGE OKAY WE CAN DO A BOND BASED ON EIGHTEEN TIMES THE THOUSAND IN AND THEN THEY WOULD COME UP WITH THE BOND AMOUNT THAT THEY WOULD PUT ON THE BALLOT. BY THAT THAT POLLING DATA NOT BY WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO REPAIR SCHOOLS ARE AT GYMS OR BUILD TOOLS IT WAS BASED ON THIS POLLING. NUMBER. AND I JUST THOUGHT OH MY GOODNESS THE SIZING ISN'T EVEN. BASED ON REAL HARD HARD DATA SO. THEN THEN THE BOND WOULD PASS AND THEN WHO GOT THE BUSINESS BUT THE THE FIRM THAT DID ALL THE POLLING ALL THE SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THIS COTTAGE INDUSTRY THAT JUST KIND OF BLEW MY MIND. AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN. WHERE WE SHOULD BE BUT I I THINK THE IDEA OF STAYING UNIFORM WITH THOUSANDS MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE THAN HUNDREDS OR I THINK THE BILL SHOULD EVEN DO BOTH WE SHOULD PROVIDED? AS A COST PER HUNDREDS AT A COST PER THOUSAND SO WE CAN ASSIST VOTERS WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THE MAP DECISIONS IN. THE POLLING PLACE OPEN BOTH SO I'LL ALLAH A MOVE THE BILL BE STRUCTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH. CENTER MORE LOCK WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS QUESTIONS I WILL HAVE SOME VERY BRIEF ITEMS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. UP WHAT I TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU THIS SUMMER FOR ALL THIS WORK -- ON THIS ISSUE. AND IN THE SUMMER AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS -- IN MY ONLY WORDS WILL BE THIS IS AT NUMBER ONE I HAVE NOT HEARD. FROM VOTERS ON THE NORTH COAST OR THE NORTH BAY AREA ABOUT CONFUSION RELATED TO SCHOOL BONDS. IN FACT WHAT I SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. OUR VOTER STEPPING UP TO BE A SUPPORT LOCAL SCHOOLS. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE RELATED TO CONFUSION I HAVE NOT SEEN BROAD CONFUSION. OTHER FOLKS THAT I WORK. FOR RELATED TO SCHOOL BONDS BEING ON A LOCAL BALLOT -- I HAVE GREAT RESPECT IS A MEMBER I AM GONNA BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL TODAY BUT I LIKE TO BETTER TRAINED OVER TO THE SIM LIMóN. AT FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THE COMMITTEE AND OR CLOSING STATEMENT IN AGAIN THANK YOU SOME NUMBER FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH ME ON THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR -- AT THEPOINT OF AB SIX TO AND IS TO REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION AND MAKE VOTERS MORE AWARE OF WHAT SOMETHING WOULD COST THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A FAIR. THING TO DO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE ON THE BALLOT RIGHT NOW WE TELL THEM ABOUT ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT THAT MIGHT DO THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROVIDE. TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- TO FOR NEW SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION AND WE'RE GONNA OPEN THIS NEW PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ALL THESE THINGS AROUND THERE AND THEN IT SAYS THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST PROPERTY TAXES WILL HAVE TO BE INCREASED. BY THIS ABOUT FOR THIS DURATION AND SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO BALANCE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD AND I THINK IF WE DO THAT WE DON'T DECREASE. THE CHANCES OF VOTERS WILL VOTE FOR THIS WEEK INCREASE THE CHANCES THE BORDERS OF OFFICE WHEN WE TRY CONVERSELY TO SWEEP THINGS UNDER THE RUG. AND WE TRIED OBSCURE WHAT THINGS ARE GONNA COST I THINK VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE NO IN THE LITERATURE THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU I THINK IT'S PROOF OF THAT SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE ON A. B. SIX DOWN. IN OUR THANK YOU SO MUCH THE MOTION IS ON THE FLOOR THE MOTION IS BY THE VICE CHAIR OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO ELECTIONS.

OKAY THAT THAT IS A FIVE ZERO BIPARTISAN VOTE THINKING SO MUCH. NUMBER EIGHTEEN CAN YOU LOSS DUE TO MAKE A QUICK -- MEETING UP HERE IN WE'RE GONNA GET OUT PAS BUTTON FOR TWO MINUTES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU GEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE TAKING UP ITEM NUMBER TEN THIS IS AB -- ELEVEN SIXTY TWO FOCUSING ON LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS. WE HAVE A DOUBLE HEADER BY THE GOOD TO SOME WOMEN FROM SAN JOSE. WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SOME NEVER KALRA AN AB. ELEVEN SIXTY TWO SOME INDIVIDUALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SHARED. THE PROLIFERATION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE IS HAVING A DEVASTATING IMPACT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OVERWHELMING LANDFILLS. THOSE TINY PLASTIC SHAMPOO BOTTLES THAT ARE COMMON IN HOTEL OOMS REPRESENT A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF WAYS THAT CAN BE EASILY ELIMINATED MORE COST EFFECTIVE. AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES. SENATE BILL THAT IS SIXTY TWO WOULD RESTRICT HOTELS AND OTHER LODGING ESTABLISHES REPLACING SMALL SINGLE USE BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO CONDITIONER ABOUT SO. IN GUEST ROOMS OR BATHROOMS BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR LARGE HOTELS AND JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HOTELS A FIFTY ROOMS ARE LESS. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT EACH ROOM CAN GENERATE UP TO ONE THOUSAND TINY BOTTLES PER YEAR? WHICH REALLY MEANS ABOUT A HUNDRED WHICH REALLY MEANS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF BOTTLES A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE DESTINED LANDFILLS ROOM WE ARE REMOVING IS SIGNIFICANT. ALSO IT IS NOT FEASIBLE. THESE PASTA BOTTLES TO BE MANAGED AND RECYCLE BECAUSE THEIR SMALL SIZE AND THE RESIDUAL PRODUCT LEFT IN THE BOTTLES -- ON AVERAGE ONLY ABOUT EACH BOTTLE. WHAT THE BILL PREMIUMS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING FORWARD FROM ADOPTING ORDINANCES ON LODGING ESTABLISHMENTS FOR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AND PLASTIC BOTTLES HAS DEFINED THE BILL? THIS IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THERE IS VALUE IN A STATE STANDARD THAT HOTEL BRANDS CAN COMPLY WITH AND THERE'S AN EXPECTATION. OTHER THEY CAN MEET RATHER THAN HAVING FIFTY SIXTY DIFFERENT RULES TO ABIDE BY. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AS WELL AS THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY TRADE ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS SUPERVISORS ZACH FRIEND OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND JOHN CALLED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION. REMEMBER WE'RE GRATEFUL THE SUPERVISORS HERE HEY DOING TO PROVIDE YOU THINK YOU ABOUT COMMITTEE INTO THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOUR TWO MINUTES SIR. BUT MR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE -- AS A PRINCE WATER THE ORIGINAL ORDINANCE IT'S HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY IN FRONT OF YOU -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE INDUSTRY AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO CREATE AN ORDINANCE THAT COULD BE REPLICATED AS STATEWIDE LEVEL THAT WE KNEW WOULD BENEFIT BOTH THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. OUR NUMBER ONE LOCAL ECONOMY COMPONENT IS TOURISM TOURISM SPECIFICALLY ON THE COASTAL SIDE OF CALIFORNIANS YOU KNOW PLASTIC WASTE WATER WAYS AS WELL SABRINA VARMINT. IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO THAT WAS ACTIONABLE AND REASONABLE -- WE HELP CRAFT A BILL WITH THE ASSOCIATION THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM THAT WOULD REDUCE THEIR COSTS AND ALSO HAVE A REASONABLE TIME WHEN FOR IMPLEMENTATION -- SOME OF THE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE LOCAL HOTELS HAVE ALREADY STARTED IMPLEMENTING IT WITHIN OUR COUNTY OF SAID THAT IT'S REDUCE COSTS AND BEEN EASIER -- THING FOR THEM TO MANAGE IT'S BEEN NOTHING BUT SUCCESS OF OUR LOCAL AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SAID MY LEVEL. SUPERVISOR NETWORK AND ACTUALLY SEE THIS UP -- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS ON THE NORTH COAST AS WELL AS INSIDE ORIGINAL INVITATION SO WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE LEADERSHIP IS WELL -- OF COURSE IS A MEMBER KALRA FOR AYE HIM TAKEN THE SIGN WE KNOW WE'RE TROUBLING CALLED WELLS IN COMMITTEE. WATCH OUT -- IT HE DID NOT BRING ANY BOTTLES -- SO TODAY THERE WE GO CALDWELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR WE WALK ME AT THE END JUST WANTED MOM TO ALSO RECOGNIZE NOT EVERY DAY. THAT YOU HAVE THE INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT OF AN ISSUE LIKE THIS SO -- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE SOME MEMBER ON THIS FLOOR IS YOURS SIR TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- JOHN CALDWELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION. THE INDUSTRY ALREADY IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO CREATE MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE -- INTER INTER CONTINENTAL HOTEL GROUPS IS LISTED ON THE S. AND P. DOW JONES SUSTAINABILITY INDEX HILTON IS REDUCE LANDFILL WASTE BY 41%. HI IT IS COMMITTED TO DIVERTING MARRIOTT LESTER MARRIOTT ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INSTALL B	C DISPENSERS AND FOREIGNER FIFTY PROPERTIES INCLUDING HIGH AND FACILITIES LIKE THE RITZ CARLTON. AND MARRIOTT'S NOT ALONE ALL ACROSS. THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY THE INDUSTRY -- FROM BED AND BREAKFAST ECONOMY HOTELS TO LUXURY HOTELS ARE PHASING OUT PLASTICS -- SO WE SUPPORT ELEVEN SIXTY TWO WE ONE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WAS FOUR ELEVEN SIXTY TWO BECAUSE IT ALLOWS. THE TIME NEEDED FOR THIS TRANSITION AND IT DOES IT IN A UNIFORM AND PREDICTABLE MANNER -- SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US -- TO TO COME TO THIS COME TO THIS CONCLUSION TO IT AND AGAIN WE SUPPORT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH CALDWELL LIVE WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE WE'RE GONNA WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION GOOD MORNING AFTERNOON. OR MORNING OR MOURNING REAL GOOD COVERAGE ON BEHALF OF SURFRIDER HEAL THE BAY AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING NATALIE MAX ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU NATALIE. WE'RE GONNA DO A LAST CALL LAST CALL FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD LOOKING FOR LAST CALL. NOW GOING TO TURN OVER THOSE WHO MAY BE OPPOSED. LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. BRING TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE THE BILL TO SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONVERSATION CENTER TARA SO. AIR I WANTED TO ASK IF WE HAVE A A ANY IDEA IF THIS WILL COST ANY IT. IF THERE'S A COST TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL BE ANY COST IN ADDITION TO COST THE ALREADY HAVE IN TERMS OF PERMITTING AND AND APPROVAL I MEAN THE WITH THE REALITY S THAT -- THIS IS NOT TO AND AND WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR -- AN INTENTION OF HAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY. OF THE GOVERNMENT -- OFFICIAL GOING INTO ROOMS AND AND LOOKING UP TO SEE IF HOTELS ARE COMPLYING OR NOT I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE. A BOTH A SELF POLICING AS WELL AS CUSTOMER. RECOGNITION MODEL CUSTOMERS WILL KNOW WHETHER IS HAPPENING OR NOT BUT THERE'S NO BELIEVE THAT'LL BE A COST OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF THEY DO -- THE END UP HAVING A CITATION BECAUSE CERTAINLY RECOVER THAT COST WITH THE WITH THE SUBSEQUENT VIOLATIONS. AND DO WE HAVE ANY CLARIFICATION ON IN TERMS OF WHETHER CHARTER CITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE BILL'S BAN -- WITH THIS OF THIS OF WITH APPLY TO OF THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WHETHER THEY'RE IN CHARTER CITIES. UNINCORPORATED I MEAN REALLY IT'S A IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD POLICY THAT WOULD SLOWLY PHASE OUT THE USE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. OKAY AND THEN JUST -- TO JUST CLARIFY THERE IS A A A A FEES INVOLVED IN TERMS OF IF YOU'RE FOUND -- IN VIOLATION OF THE BAN IS THAT CORRECT THE IN THE IN ITS INITIALLY A WARNING LETTER. THAT WARNING THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENTION IS IS -- TO HAVE A WARNING LETTER SENATE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION -- DETERMINES THAT -- THERE'S A HOTEL THAT'S NON COMPLIANCE -- BUT I THINK THE FACT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY THE GOOD THING ABOUT THATIS THAT GIVING THEM THE THREE TO FOUR YEARS ALLOWS THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW THE THE STATE AND THE INDUSTRY TOGETHER TO GET THE WORD OUT. TO TO HOTELS AND MOTELS AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE AND THEY NEED ASSISTANCE. THE THE TO HAVE THEIR PRIMARY TRADE GROUP IN SUPPORT I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD POSITION TO BE AND AND AND MANY PHOTOS ALREADY MOVING THAT DIRECTION BUT THEN THIS YEAR MARRIOTT. BUT TO BE UNDER PROPERTIES NORTH AMERICA ALREADY PAYS OUT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC AND SO IT'S ALREADY THE DRUG TO THE INDUSTRY PARTLY BECAUSE IT DOES SAVE THE MONEY. AND THE THREE TO FOUR YEAR LEAD TIME TO GET THEM. EVEN THE SMALLER OPERATORS TIME OF THE FOUR YEARS WE GIVE SMALLER OPERATORS THE TIME -- IN A BASIN AND SO I THINK FOR TODAY AND I'M GOING TO JUST LAY OFF THE BILL JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DIG A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO IT -- BUT YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I A WILL OPPOSE OR SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR IF IF AND WHEN IT DOES GET THERE BUT I JUST WANTEDTO PUT THAT THERE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I DO SOME MORE RESEARCH. YOU KNOW LOOK INTO IT A BIT MORE ON MY OWN AND THE IMPACTS ON ON THE DISTRICT. THE IN IT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE SUPERVISOR TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL IMPACT ANYMORE OR IF. THAT BE HELPFUL AT ALL TO YOU THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR TODAY. THANK YOU BECAUSE IT CENTER. WHAT WHAT OF SAVING ON TWO ITEMS -- IN THEIR TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF CHARTER CITIES. YES THERE'S A BELIEF I THINK THAT IS A MEMBER WANTS TO BE AND I DON'T EVER PUT WORDS IN THE SOME MEMBERS MATH THAT BEING EXPLICIT ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE POURED I THAT MAYBE. SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION DOWN THE ROAD AND I DO BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY WOULD SUPPORT THAT AS WELL. THAT'S CORRECT -- SO WE ARE LOOKING AT YEAH A DECEPTIVE THE CLARIFICATION MAKING SURE THAT'S EXPLICIT. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT AND AGAIN JUST WANTED TO COME A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS IN THE REFER TACK ON THIS ISSUE -- IN INCREASES IN NUMBER BUT PUSH BACK ON THE IF YOU THINK I'M INCORRECT I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT STATEWIDE IS TO BE ABLE. TO TRY TO BETTER YOU BRING IN A FORMAL -- Là CRY SO THAT EVERYONE BIG OR SMALL -- IS SUBJECT TO THAT -- BUT THEY'RE MOST LIKELY WON'T BE A WHOLE LOT OF LOCAL ENFORCEMENT BUT TRYING TO GET A STREAMLINED THAT AND I WOULD. CHARACTERIZE THE COST OF MINOR YEAH -- IF NOT OBSERVABLE ACROSS THE STATE. THAT'S CORRECT POSTURE AND THE THE UNIFORMITY IS CRITICAL ESPECIALLY FOR THE INDUSTRY -- IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE ONE JUST SIX AND THAT'S GOING TO BAN LOTION ANOTHER ONE TO PAY IS ANOTHER ONE IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A DIFFERENT KIND OF DISPENSER THAN THE ONE ACROSS THE STREET. THE CITY ACROSS THE STREET. AND THAT'S I THINK WHY WAS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK SO WELL WITH INDUSTRY IS AT THE RECOGNITION THAT. THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ TAKE LEADERSHIP. OTHER CITIES COUNTIES MAY VERY WELL FOLLOW I THINK HAVING A UNIFORM WILL NOT ONLY GET THIS IN PLACE MORE QUICKLY -- BUT ACROSS THE BOARD BUT IT PREVENTS THESE ONE OFFS WHICH WOULD MAKE IT REALLY CHALLENGING FOR THE INDUSTRY AND FRANKLY FOR THE STATE. TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE AND MONITOR IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR REDUCING THE PLASTIC AS WELL AS BEING TOO ONEROUS FOR THE INDUSTRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IN TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR MS VICE CHAIR. YOU. FAIR SOMETIMES -- WE GET TO WATCH INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE THE KIND OF SELF REGULATE AND START TAKING CARE OF THE CONCERNS OVER HEARING TESTIMONY THAT THE MAJOR CHAINS ARE. ALREADY MOVING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION SO I'VE. KIND OF WANT. TO MAYBE HAS SOME. SIMPLE QUESTIONS JUST SO THAT I CAN ANSWER THEM WHEN I GET OUT IN PUBLIC HERE -- THE FIRST IS IF IF THEY'RE VOLUNTARILY. MAKING GREAT MOVES OUT WHY THE NEED FOR THE BILL. I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT YES THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION INDUSTRY HAS TENDED TO BE A FOR THINKING WHEN IT COMES IN BY MAIL ISSUES. HOWEVER A THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A UNIFORM RULE THAT PUTS A TIME LINE IN PLACE THAT'S ACCOUNTABLE TIMELINE FOR THE INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO GET BOTH THE LARGEST MOTELS. ON BOARD -- IT IN FRANKLY IT'S AS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THE INDUSTRY WASN'T GOING IN THAT DIRECTION FOLKS SAY WELL WHY YOU PUSHING INDUSTRY THAT'S NOT READY YET. WHAT INDUSTRY SHOWS AND IS READY I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY THE OPPORTUNE TIME FOR US TO PUT IN A STATE RULE THAT'S UNIFORM -- AND AGAIN I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE. A REALLY -- BACK. TO THE VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE INDUSTRY IF YOU START GETTING TO AT TEN TWENTY THIRTY ORDINANCES AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE TIMING IS ACTUALLY PERFECT IN THAT SENSE. BECAUSE SINCE THE INDUSTRY'S ALREADY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IF WE DO NOTHING. THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I CAN ALMST GUARANTEE THEY'LL BE AT LEAST A DOZEN DIFFERENT LOCAL ORDINANCES IN PLACE THEN THE INDUSTRY TO COME TO US TO SAY CAN YOU JUST MAKE A UNIFORM RULE. AND THE WILL HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SAYING WAIT A SECOND YOU TAKE MY LOCAL PREEMPTION RATCHET GETTING AHEAD OF THAT BY MAKING A UNIFORM RULE ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW. SO THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE THEY ALREADY KNOW THEY'RE DOING THAT THAT THE STATE IS ALREADY WORKING ON PHASING OUT THIS PLASTIC. AND I THINK IT PUTS US IN A POSITION WHERE. INDUSTRY WE'RE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT RIGHT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF REDUCING THEIR COSTS BUT ALSO. PREVENTS -- THE THIRTY DIFFERENT RULES FOR INDUSTRY DATA BYE BYE -- WHEN -- HOTEL GUESTS ARRIVED THERE USED TO ALWAYS LITTLE BOND YEAH. OTHER GOING TO GET. DISPENSERS TYPICALLY WILL BE DISPENSERS AND OTHER ACTION I'VE BEEN TO A NUMBER OF HOTELS ARE TRAVEL WERE YOU SEE DISPENSERS THAT ARE IN PLACE THERE SECURE THEIR SAFE -- THEIR BILLABLE IN A SAFE MANNER AND BY THE WAY -- THE LITTLE BOTTLES ARE STILL AVAILABLE AT THE FRONT DESK -- IN SO IF THE HOTEL WNTS TO MAKE THE OFFER THEM AT THE FRONT DESK FOR FOR THOSE I STILL WANT. TO HAVE THEM THEY CAN ORDER THEIR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT FOR SOME REASON CAN'T USE A DISPENSER THE MAYBE THE ROOM THERE THE THOSE OPTIONS ALSO BE AVAILABLE AND THOSE TO BE ABLE TO SELL. LITTLE BOTTLES AT THE HOTEL SHOP AS WELL AS JUST INSIDE THE ACTUAL BATHROOM OF THE ROOMS. YOU'RE A GREAT LAST QUESTION -- A BABY LIKE SQUEEZE TUBES LIKE YOU KNOW WE GET LITTLE LIKE. MUSTARD AND KETCHUP. FOR AT FAST FOODS BUT IF WE GET SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER AND TUBES THAT CREATE ANOTHER PROBLEM OR OR ORDERS DISPENSARIES PROBABLY THE MOST LIKELY ROUTE THAT MOST OF THESE HOTELS ARE GOING TO TAKE I THINK IT'S TO SPENCER BECAUSE OF IT'S UNLIKELY THE INDUSTRIES IS GOING TO GO TO ANOTHER. SMALL. ITEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA SAY THE MANY MONEY. AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE PRACTICAL FOR THEM I THINK THE PRACTICAL MOVE IS TO GO IN THE DIRECTION WHERE THEY HAD THESE DISPENSERS AND MANY OF THOSE KEYS TUBES ARE PLASTIC AS WELL AS THEY WOULDN'T COMPLY. WITH -- WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO THAT OUR PAPER OPTIONS ARE SOMETIMES ARE SOAPS THERE IN PAPER AND ALL THAT THAT'S FINE SO THOSE WILL BE OPTIONS -- FOR THE HOTELS AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN SEEN -- IN A HOTEL RELATIVELY RECENTLY IS CISCO WHERE THEY HAD LARGER -- DISPENSERS OR LARGER BOTTLES ARE SECURED AND THEN THEY HAD A LITTLE SIGN MARKETING THE PRODUCTS THAT HELP YOU REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT THERE FOR SALE FOR TWELVE DOLLARS A BOTTLE TEN ARE YOU. WILL BRING A TEAR ROOM SO -- THERE SO OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTE FOR THE COMP THE PERSONAL CARE COMPANIES TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK FOR MUCH SERVER CALLER THINKING. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR LOOK AT LOOK AT THIS AS WE TOOK WE IS THE STATE TOOK THE WRONG APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO PLASTIC BAGS -- WE DIDN'T HAVE A BACKBONE TO BE ABLE TO BAN PLASTIC BAGS. AND THEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO TAKE THE LEAD AND IT TOOK NEARLY A DECADE IN BILLIONS OF PLASTIC BAGS BILL TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER -- AND LOOK AT THIS AS PUT IN THE WORK IN THE FRONT END WORKING COLLABORATIVE THE INDUSTRY AND VICE VERSA GIVE IT A LOOK AND ESTABLISH LAW -- THAT IS UNIFORM ACROSS. THE STATE. THANKS TO LEADERSHIP -- IN SANTA CRUZ A VERY GRATEFUL FOR TAKEN THAT FOR SLEEP IT IS NEVER EASY. I'M A SUPERVISOR SO DO APPRECIATE AT MANTECH MOMENTS I THINK IT IS A MEMBER. FOR ALL OF HIS EFFORT HOW COULD THIS IS NOT BEEN EASY -- IN LATELY WE'RE USING WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF PLASTIC BOTTLES ARE BEING USED ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S IT'S HARD TO TELL AS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS CAUSES BY ASSN IS A THOUSAND PER HOTEL ROOM FOR YEARS THE AVERAGE.

US MIGHT AS WE KNOW IS OUR ELECTRIC PROVIDER FOR THE SACRAMENTO REGION IT'S A PUBLIC pAGENCY -- GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDING LOW RATES A LOWER THAN OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES A-RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER CIVIC CLEAN GAZE AT THE FOREFRONT. INDY CARBON ISING ARE GREETED -- RIGHT NOW SMUD WORKS WITH BUSINESSES TO GIVE THEM THEIR EXPERTISE ELECTRICITY EMPOWER MANAGEMENT. IS SIX IT'S A VERY HELPFUL THESE EMERGING GREEN TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE USUALLY IN THE START UP PHASE -- IF THE START UPS ARE PURCHASED AS IT HAPPENED THE PAST BY OTHER COMPANIES AS BUT HASN'T BEEN ABLE. TO TO GET VALUE WITH THAT AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF VALUE ON THE EQUITY THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING AS I SAID. THIS WOULD BRING PARITY TO WHAT OUR IDEA USE CAN DO. THIS WITHOUT THE DUAL BENEFIT OF ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP US REACH REACH OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. AND ALSO OFFSETTING RATE INCREASES FOR OUR LOCAL CUSTOMERS TO HELP REACH THESE GOALS -- FAIRNESS ISSUE THE RATE PAYERS AS MUCH AT THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU MY NAME'S MARK RAWSON -- I'M THE MANAGER OF NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FOR SOME ODD. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY -- FOR LET ME PRESENT -- THIS TESTIMONY TODAY -- WERE THE SIX LARGEST A COMMUNITY OWNED ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE COUNTRY -- SECOND LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA WE SERVE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION -- CUSTOMERS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN SMALL PORTIONS OF A PLASTER YOLO. COUNTIES -- I WANT TO THINK -- THE COMMITTEE ALSO FOR WORKING WITH US AND SOME OF THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO TO THIS -- TO THIS BILL. SO SMART HAS A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING WITH CUT COMPANIES ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT PROVIDE INNOVATIVE -- SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ADDRESS ENERGY AFFORDABILITY AND RELIABILITY. AND WE CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY AS SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS WILL BE NEEDED IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES GRID MODERNIZATION ENERGY RESOURCES AND ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION. TO ME CALIFORNIA'S GARB CARBON REDUCTION IN CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. FOR SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MODE PROVIDES ACCESS TO ITS OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY -- WE DEVOTE STAFF TIME -- WE PROVIDE CRITICAL FIELD TESTING OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES -- AND WHILE WE GET THE PRODUCT THAT WE NEED COMPANIES THAT WE PARTNER WITH ME THEN CAPITALIZE ON OUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR PRODUCT. BY MARKETING THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OTHER UTILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AT A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PROFIT TO THEM BUT NOT NECESSARILY SMARTER JUST MUCH CUSTOMERS. FOR INSTANCE SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE INVESTED TIME AND EFFORT WITH A COMPANY TO DEVELOP A SIGNIFICANT NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCT. THAT ANALYZES METER DATA TO COMPARE CUSTOMER ENERGY USAGE FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS COMPANY WAS ACQUIRED -- SUBSEQUENTLY -- TO THAT THAT ASSISTANCE FROM SMUD AND THAT COMPANY WAS ACQUIRED AND SOLD FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IF WE HAD NEGOTIATED NON STOCK SECURITY IN THAT COMPANY OUR CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM A FINANCIAL RETURN PAID THIS MONTH FOR OUR CONTRIBUTION TO THAT PRODUCT -- THE TIMES PARTICULAR RIGHT FIRST MONTH INVESTMENTS TO BE FAIRLY COMPENSATED. AS MUCH AS PLANNING TO SPEND A LITTLE OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR NET ZERO CARBON EMISSION GOALS AS OUTLINED IN OUR RECENTLY ADOPTED ANGERED RESOURCE PLAN. THIRTY SEVEN IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- WE'RE GONNA MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS -- IN ORDER TO MEET SOME OF THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY MANDATES -- AND THIS WILL RESULT IN INCREASES OF RATES TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. ANY NEW REVENUE THAT RESULTS FROM THIS BILL WILL GO DIRECTLY TO HELP STABILIZING -- THESE RATE INCREASES AND I THINK YOUR TIME FOR WHEN WE TESTIFY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT CHANGEABLE EXAMPLE COMMITTEES WELL ON HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE? TO PLEASE GOOD MORNING MA'AM WELCOME IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR FIRST CLASS ORGANIZATION AND YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. NAME IS LISA HAGERMAN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS AT TBL PARTNERS WERE A DOUBLE BOTTOM LINE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE INVEST FOR FINANCIAL RETURNS AS WELL AS SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS IN THE SECTORS AND REGIONS IN WHICH WE INVEST. WE'VE -- BEEN AROUND FIFTEEN YEARS AND WERE EARLY INVESTORS AND SOLAR CITY AND NOW INVESTING OUT OF A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FUND THAT'S IN MAN IT INVESTING IN -- ENERGY STORAGE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS ADVANCE MY CAREER IT'S LUCIEN'S DVL SUPPORTS AB SIX EIGHTY NINE AND SPOTS EFFORT TO DRIVE INNOVATION IN THE CLEAN ENERGY SPACE THROUGH TEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PRODUCTS. SB SIX EIGHTY NINE WILL BRING TO MARKET THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE OUR STATES. CLIMATE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. SMUD BOARD RECENTLY ADOPTED ONE OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS WITH A PATH TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY. TWENTY FORTY CREATING INCENTIVES FOR USE UTILITIES TO WORK WITH YOUNG INNOVATIVE COMPANIES HELPS REDUCE THE RISK OF NEW START UP INVESTMENTS. THAT WILL ATTRACT MORE INVESTORS LIKE DB ALL PARTNERS AND CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY. WHEN YOUNG START UPS ARE PARTNERING WITH UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO REFINE THEIR TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO AGREE TO ROYALTY AGREEMENTS? AS THOSE CAN HAMPER FUTURE GROWTH. HOWEVER THE PROBE THE OPTIONS PROVIDED UNDER AB SIX EIGHTY NINE WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR SMUD AND START UP COMPANIES TO FORM STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. THAT COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCES. THE B. L. PARTNERS LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO THINK CREATIVELY. TO BE ABLE TO INVEST AND INNOVATE TO MEET OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE DISTRICTS RATE PAYERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT THE BILL SUPPORTS A. B.. SIX EIGHTY NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE WITH LIKE TO GET A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WHO'S IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] PLEASE.

HEARING SE NINE WERE NOT GONNA WELCOME ANYONE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION. LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE ANY QUESTIONS ARE CONVERSATIONS THE DEVICE YOU'RE PLEASE. MATURE I ENTRY I'M INTRIGUED BY THIS BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT. IN THIS PALACE GOING OUTSIDE OF THEIR BASIC CORE BUSINESS I AM. IN FACT -- MAYBE ASK MISTER ROSSIN A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS YOU. MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU ARE AND CALPERS. YES AT DO YOU HAVE A FOR A ONE A THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES THAT -- ABOVE AND BEYOND THE DB PLAN. FOR A FOUR ONE K. S. MONDAY ALLOWS OR ONE A FOR ME IS PROUD OF DONE JUST THAT. I BELIEVE THA'S TRUE I'M NOT A I'M NOT SURE SPECIFICALLY ON THAT. YOU'RE NOT IN IT -- DRUG A LOT OF MUNICIPALITIES ALSO OFFER A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN THAT THEY CAN. INVEST IN I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR PAY CHECK GO OUT EVERY EVERY EVERY EVERY PAY PERIOD -- BECAUSE I WAS THINKING PROBABLY THE IDEAS THAT ARE BEING GENERATED ARE BEING GENERATED BY YOUR EMPLOYEES IS THAT CORRECT. SEC SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT ARE GENERATED BY SMALL EMPLOYEES WE USED -- TO HELP THESE COMPANIES GET THEIR PRODUCTS COMMERCIALLY READY. YES. I'M JUST WONDERING IF -- IF IF YOU WOULD YOU WOULD BE LIMITED TO NON STOCK -- SECURITIES IF YOU DID IT INSIDE YOUR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. YOU CAN OWN STOCK YOU COULD ACTUALLY. MAKE IT PART OF YOUR PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO YOU CAN WORK WITH. B. B. L. PARTNERS AND AND AND OWN ACTUAL SHARES AND BENEFIT THE EMPLOYEES WOULD BENEFIT IN THEIR IN THEIR PRIVATE JOB. YOU KNOW DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS AND THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT SHE IS -- IS A SPACE WHERE THIS WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN AND IN IF THE RATE IT WITH THE RATES -- THAT THE UTILITIES MIGHT GET ALL WE ALWAYS REDUCE THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN DID THEN TRANSFER SOME SAVINGS ON THE TAXPAYERS OF THE RATEPAYERS. SO THAT WAS SORT OF THE SPACE THAT I YEAH I SAW -- THE SEVEN FORTY THROUGH THE CHAIR MAYBE I CAN ADDRESS THAT TOO I THINK THE GOAL IT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS THE NOTION WELL WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS THAT. ALLOWING THEM TO MAXIMIZING THEIR CURRENT PARTNERSHIPS WITH WHERE THERE IS NONE AND SO WHETHER USING THOSE MONIES TO HELP THE RATE PAYERS LOWER POTENTIAL RATE INCREASES IN THE FUTURE. OR FOR THEIR YOU KNOW LONG TERM FIXED COSTS LIKE RETIREMENT HEALTH IT'S ALL PART OF THAT SAME. POOL YOU KNOW SMART HAS COST. FURTHER ENERGY PROCUREMENT FURTHER TRANSMISSION LINES FOR THE WHOLE WORKS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES AND SO. I THINK IT'S KIND OF PART PARCEL THAT IT'S A PACKAGE. THAT WILL HAVE THIS BENEFIT TO THE TO THE MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT WHETHER IT'S THAT RETIREMENT OR THIS OTHER PIECE I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S NECESSARY. I JUST PROVIDED. OKAY A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH GOVERNMENTS GETTING INVOLVED IN. TRANSACTION SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND MY COMFORT ZONE. THANK YOU MISTER JOE THANK YOU SO MUCH. INDIA OF THE DECEMBER COMING ON THIS I THINK THAT -- WITH THE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER HIS OFFICE ON RATE PAYER PROTECTION RIGHT -- SO ALLOWING THESE INVESTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED. ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO ARE RATE PAYERS -- ARE PROTECTED AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENTS ALSO STRIKE THAT BALANCE CRITICALLY BEING A PUBLIC AGENCY I DON'T KNOW IF. THE STATE REPRESENTATIVE WOULD LIKE TO BE A TALK ABOUT DATA THIS IN THERE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE TO ALLOW FOR THE INNOVATION. IN TO FLOURISH WHILE ALSO SINCE THE PUBLIC ENTITY PROTECTING THE REPAIRS. YEAH I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL SAFEGUARDS IN YOUR FROM THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PRIOR ONE AND ONE IS A PILOT FOR FIVE YEARS. YOU KNOW WE LIMIT THE NUMBER OF THESE WE CAN DO AT THREE AND A LIMIT THE THE AMOUNT SO NO MORE THAN 3% OF THE DISTRICT'S ANNUAL REVENUE SO. CAN BE SOME MASSIVE PROJECT IS GONNA. A NO LEVERAGE AND ANY PARTY SO I THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE INTO THIS SPACE WHICH AGAIN. OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES CURRENTLY DO AND THAT BENEFITS SHAREHOLDERS AND SO. WHY NOT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BENEFIT TO TAXPAYERS WERE PART OF THIS MISCIBLE DISTRICT? THANK YOU SENATE PLEASE IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER THING TO IN A MINUTE WE TOOK IN THE ASSEMBLY. REQUIRES OUR BOARD TO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES AND DO CERTAIN ACTIONS TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THESE ACTIVITIES -- THAT ALSO PROVIDES -- SOME -- REPAIR PROTECTION AND SOME VISIBILITY INTO POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST RELATED ISSUES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALRIGHT LET ME SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALSO WOULD WELCOME A MOTION AT THIS TIME. AB WE GET A MOTION BY CENTER TYLER WATCH OUT.

CRISIS IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN I WAS ABLE TO GET AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FIVE SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH ALSO AMENDED THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. HE GAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS OF FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL FOR SURPLUS PUBLIC LANDS. UNFORTUNATELY THE SECOND BUT LAW WENT INTO A FACT PEOPLE TRY TO CIRCUMVENT A WE HAVE A SITUATION THE CITY OF OAKLAND THAT WENT TO A PRIVATE DEVELOPER SAID ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. CIRCUMVENT THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WE HAVE THE CITY OF BURLINGAME CREATING A HEALTH DISTRICT WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO BUILD SENIOR HOUSING BUT NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO. THE THE AGAIN THAT. THE LAWS OF STATED NOW SAYS THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE TO GET THAT FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL IT TO THEM. BUT THEY AT LEAST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THAT GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO GO GET. THAT PROPERTY -- WHAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX DOES IT CLARIFIES THIS PROVISION OF SURPLUS LAND AS WELL AS THE DEFINITION OF SURPLUS LAND? IT ALSO CREATES A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF LOCAL SURPLUS PLANTS. IT ALSO LEVERAGES OUR HOUSING ELEMENT LAW TO PROMOTE IN USE -- BUT THE AND THE USE OF THE SURPLUS LAND ACTS SO WITH THAT WE HAVE -- TO GREAT WITH THIS SPOKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF S. BY THE A. B.. FORTY SIX THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SOMEONE WE'RE GONNA ASK OUR WITNESSES TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO KEEP HIS. ALL RIGHT AT FIRST MY SAME ORGANIZATION WE WELCOME YOU COMMITTEE SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH.

FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX IT IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE AND PUBLICLY ON LAND COULD PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND UP LIKE BACON OR PARKING LOTS CAN BE PRIORITIZED TO BENEFIT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE WAY IT WILL DO THAT IS BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA SURPLUS LAND OCT. THIS IS A FIFTY YEAR OLD LAW WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT SURPLUS PUBLIC LAND IS USED FOR THE PUBLIC CRIED. BY FROM BY PRIORITIZING THE LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. MANY PRACTICAL OBSTACLES EXIST TO ACTUALLY ENFORCING THE SURPLUS LAND ACT WHICH THIS BILL WILL HELP CORRECTIVE INCLUDING. CREATING A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS SURPLUS AND WHAT IS NOT. CLARIFY WHAT IS SURPLUS WHAT IS NOT AND IMPROVING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW BY GIVING A TO THE OVERSIGHT OVER IT. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE THOUGHTFUL AND DILIGENT WORK BY YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF OVER ON THIS BILL OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS A TWO WEEKS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE SIXTY PLUS AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED HAVE ACTUALLY GREATLY STRENGTHEN THE BILL -- AND SO WE THOUGHT WE WOULD LIKE FOR WE WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE FOR TODAY SO THAT THE STATE CAN.

WE'RE A FIFTY ONE YEAR OLD NONPROFIT DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BASED IN THE NORTH BAY WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HAWAII. AND WE SERVE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR NINE THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS SO LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE NEXT MONEY IS OBTAINING LAND -- IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE. FOR PUBLIC SLASH SURPLUS LANDS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOLID PROPOSALS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY. IT WILL RELIEVE BLIGHT HELP DEVELOP UNDERSERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES AND REDUCE THE STATE WIDE HOUSING GAP. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT PROVIDING REVENUE -- TO GOVERNMENT LANDOWNERS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A WIN WIN THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN IS OUR PROJECT AT HAMILTON MEADOWS IN NEVADA -- THAT WAS BUILT ON THE DE COMMISSIONED HAMILTON AIRFORCE BASE WE DEVELOP THE SITE INTO A LOVELY FAMILY PERMANENT SUPPORT HOUSING PROJECT WITH A HUNDRED AND ONE UNITS. SOME OF WHICH ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV AIDS. ALSO AT HAMILTON WE DEVELOPED EIGHTY TO SUBSIDIZE HOMEOWNERSHIP UNITS.

THANK YOU SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GONNA BE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVING US YOUR FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION -- ESPECIALLY THIS WHO'S GONNA KICK US OFF. SPECIAL DISTRICTS READ ROLE RIGHT FLOOR SURE SIR WELCOME THE OF TWO MINUTES. WHERE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ROUNDED BOSSY WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE? VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE HARD WORKING AMENDMENTS TO A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT ACTUALLY DO RESOLVE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN THE FIRST HOUSE TO REMOVE LEASES FROM THE BILL WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND RESOLVE THE CONCERNS FOR MANY SPECIAL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER WE ARE WE DO REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL UNTIL IT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO EXAMPLE AND THAT SPECIAL DISTRICTS NEED TO FILTER PUBLIC PURPOSES. THE BILL EVEN AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WOULD ONLY EXAMPLE AND HAS BEEN USED BY THE AGENCY FOR ITS OPERATIONS. SPECIAL DISTRICTS FREQUENTLY SELL LAND TO THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC BENEFIT. OR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. AS WRITTEN THE BILL WOULD MAKE THESE LAND LAND TRANSFER SUBJECT TO THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT. AND IN A MOMENT MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS WILL PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF CRITICALLY NEEDED EXEMPTIONS. ARTS SECOND CONCERT REMAINING CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THAT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AGENCIES TO NEGOTIATE. AND GET THE FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THEIR LAND. THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE AGENCIES TO SEND OUT NOTICES NOTICES AVAILABILITY PRIOR TO PARTICIPATING NEGOTIATIONS. THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT PROVIDE A HELPFUL DEFINITION OF NEGOTIATIONS AND IS THIS LACK OF A BRIGHT LINE THAT WILL CONFUSE AGENCIES ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT. I DON'T FLAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY OF CONCERN AS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX PENALIZES AGENCIES WHO FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AGENCIES IN VIOLATION WOULD PAY A FINE OF UP 250% OF THE LAND'S VALUE. THIS IS INCREDIBLY PUNITIVE AND EXPOSE A SMALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS THE RISK OF INSOLVENCY IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO PAY THE FINE. MORE LIKELY THESE PROVISIONS WILL SIMPLY DETERMINE YOU SPECIAL DISTRICTS FROM DISPOSING OF THE LAND AT ALL RATHER THAN RISKING THE PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE BILL. THE SELECTION LEAD TO LESS PUBLIC LAND BEING DEVELOPED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE DO REMAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH A VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT DISCONTENT AT NOT AT ALL BE RUDE YOU HAVE TO GO VOTE EDUCATION. ON YOUR TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE'RE GOING TO TRACK DOWN SENATOR HERTZBERG -- AS WE ARE IN NEED HIM TO COME VOTE AS WELL. I APOLOGIZE THE FLOOR IS YOURS TWO MINUTES IN A I DON'T MEAN TO WALK OUT ON YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. IN BREAKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO HERE. OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD SPECIFICALLY REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY. I HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ARE FAIRLY UNIQUE AS MOST SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS TEND TO SELL OR LEASE THEIR LAND SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTHCARE PURPOSES THAT ARE NEEDED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. I'M FOR EXAMPLE WE DO HAVE A DISTRICT IN MOUNTAIN VIEW THAT HAS A PIECE OF LAND THAT THEY ARE CONSIDERING IN THE FUTURE BUILDING A HOSPITAL ON IF AND THEY DON'T DO THAT THEY HAVE HAD INTEREST FROM OTHER HEALTHCARE ENTITIES. IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BUILD A HOSPITAL THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO FIRST OFF RIVER HOUSING AND GO THROUGH THE LONGER PROCESS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN THEN NEGOTIATE WITH ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY OR ANOTHER HEALTHCARE ANTI. TO BUILD THE HOSPITAL -- ADDITIONALLY A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS INCLUDE NON MONETARY CLAUSES IN THEIR LEASES AND IN THEIR SALES ON THEIR LAND TO ENSURE THAT THE SPECIFIC HEALTH CARE. REQUIREMENTS -- ON THAT SITE REMAIN. AND ADDITIONALLY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC USE CURRENT IN THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS. AND THE BILL WOULD EXCLUDE. LAND THAT'S USED FOR RETAIL OR OFFICE DEVELOPMENT MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE AND MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS THEY HAVE RETAIL PHARMACIES THAT ARE ON THEIR SITES. THEY ALSO RECEIVE A PROFIT SOME OF THEM DO -- SOME OF TEM ALSO -- OFFER THEIR LAND. AND BELOW MARKET VALUE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO SPECIFIC SERVICES BUT THOSE THAT DO YOU HAVE A PROFIT THOSE. PROFITS AND THEN FIND THE REST OF THEIR MISSION SO THE ADDITIONAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS FOR FREE. THOSE ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE OF THEIR PROFITS AND SO THIS BILL WOULD EXCLUDE IN THOSE LANDS AS SURPLUS LANDS. I'M AND THEN LASTLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE EXPANDED DEFINITION IN LOCAL AGENCY THAT'S IN THE BILL THAT WOULD APPLY TO OUR PUBLIC AND DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT LOCAL THEM TH HAVE NONPROFITS ATTACHED TO THEM AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THIS DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A NONPROFIT. THIS BILL WOULD THEN REQUIRE THOSE NONPROFITS TO COMPLY WITH THE SURPLUS LAND ACT AND AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE AND ABOUT THANK YOU. YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES CESSATION REPRESENTING PUBLIC POWER AGENCIES AND WATER AGENCIES ONE ECHO THAT THANKS TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE SET OF AMENDMENTS -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN LINE WITH SI ESTAS COMMENTS THEY DON'T QUITE GO FAR ENOUGH TO DRESS HOLLER CONCERNS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS AUTHOR AND IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AS WELL. TO FULLY RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. I MAY BE HE VICE CHAIR BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN GIVE A WHOLE SPEECH BECAUSE DAMON ASSOCIATION PLEASE CHRIS ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE ROSSUM BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN MARCOS IN OPPOSITION. HI JESSICA GEIGER WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES HERE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED.

CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. AND ARE NOW TAKING TIME HERE FOR IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT -- OUR VIEWS TRACK WITH THOSE OF ESPN'S ANYWAY [inaudible] A TWEENER. ALSO LET'S TRY TO HAVE THE CITIES OF LIVERMORE DUBLIN PLEASANTON AT SAN RAMON AND DANVILLE ADD NO FORMAL POSITION BUT WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THE STAFF FOR AOTHER CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IT'S HELP THESE AMENDMENTS OF HELP. TO CLARIFY SOME WORK WITH. QUESTIONS AND WILL BE TAKING A POSITION SAID. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR ANY OTHER WINNERS. AND WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR WIENER -- AND MOVE THE BILL -- OUR THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK IN ANOTHER. SEVERAL OTHER SURPLUS LANDS -- BILLS ARE GONNA BE I KNOW WORKING ON THEM AND HOUSING COMMITTEE AND I KNOW WILL. IF NOT NOW THEN OVER THE SUMMER WILL HARMONIZE EVERYTHING -- I I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE OPTIMAL USE OF THIS VERY LIMITED RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA LANDS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES WHO. ARE THEY MAY HAVE LANDED THEY WILL NEED THAT'S ONE THING BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO USE THE WORD CORD BUT HOLD ON THE LAND THAT THEY'RE NOT USING -- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FACILITATE -- THE USE OF THE LAND ON AS WE SEE THIS EXPLOSION HOUSING COSTS AND THIS EXPLOSION IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND LIVING IN SHELTERS AND LIVING IN TENTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE HOMELESS -- WE NEED TO DO MORE -- AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION SENATOR WINNER -- REMEMBER CHIANG EYEBROW PROBABLY WANTED TO STOP ARE YOU THE OPPOSITE MAYBE TO HAVE SOME SOME DISCUSSION. I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF USING SURPLUS LAND I REMEMBER GETTING. CONSTITUENTS COMING AND HEY WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT LAND IT JUST KIND OF SITTING THERE -- THEY WERE KIND OF GETTING A THAT -- WONDERFUL DISCUSSION OF LOCAL CONTROL AGAIN AS BATTLE THAT WE'VE HAD WITH A NUMBER OF BILLS AND IN AND YOU'VE YOU'VE ESTABLISHED PRETTY GOOD LIST OF WONDERFUL AGENCIES AND ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- SO YOU'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PUSHING AN AGENDA BUT WORK. AT TOUCHING ON SOME SOME SERIOUS NERVES. AND SO WERE MY PROBLEM IS BEEN IS THAT I LOOK AT A MAP OF ALL THE PROPERTIES IN ORANGE COUNTY. THAT THE STATE OWNS [inaudible] BETTER. VACANT AND AVAILABLE -- AS A SUPERVISOR THE FUN I HAD TRYING. TO GET PROPERTY FROM CALTRANS -- EVEN FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES WAS JUST LIKE IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING WHY THE STATE WOULD KIND OF IMPOSE ON LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WHEN IS NOT DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. OF IT WITH ITS OWN SURPLUS PROPERTY AND SO THAT'S WHERE I'M TRYING. TO THANK YOU YOU KNOW BUT HE YOU KNOW DOCTOR HE'LL BY SELF KIND OF A APPROACH THE IF WE COULD DO A RIDE OURSELVES IS SACRAMENTO THEN. THEN WE CAN COME IN AND SAY LOOK WE'VE DONE WE'VE GOT A MODEL BUT I'M NOT SEEING THAT NIGHT SO THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING. DIFFICULTIES YOU KNOW SO WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH LONGER CONVERSATION ABOUT CALTRANS -- I I DID A BILL ON CALTRANS FOR SAN FRANCISCO. TO ALLOW THE CITY AND COUNTY TO LEASE. TEN DIFFERENT PARCELS IN IN SAN FRANCISCO AT A REDUCED MARKET RATE IT'S PROVED VERY SUCCESSFUL WE ARE. TO THOSE SITES HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED FOR NAVIGATION CENTERS. AND SO AGAIN THESE ARE -- FREEWAY ON RAMP SAID AND HE WOULD YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DRIVEN BY THE MONOXIDE YOU COULD DO ANYTHING THERE. BUT NOW WE HAVE TO NAVIGATION CENTER SERVING OVER TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE GETTING THEM OFF THE STREET SO. I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT WEEK WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE AT THE STATE LEVEL. HAVING SAID THAT WE DO HAVE A FIFTY YEAR OLD LAW ON SURPLUS PUBLIC LAND ON WHAT IT IS HOW HOW WE SHOULD USE IT. WE WEEK WE REINFORCE THE IDEA OF MAKING IT AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN I DID IT. IN UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE THIS LAW STANDING ON THE BOOKS YOU HAVE. I JUST NUMEROUS AGENCIES WHO CONTINUE TO TRY TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW SO SAID TO ME IF THIS IS LESS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. AND IS ABOUT TIGHTENING IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ENFORCE A FIFTY YEAR OLD STATE LAW -- WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. I KNOW THE SPONSORS MY OFFICE WE'VE ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD GET THEM OFF -- THEIR PARTICULAR AMENDMENT WOULD BASICALLY EXEMPT THEM SO -- THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GIVE US ANY AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD -- WOULD TAKE AWAY THEIR OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN REQUESTED FOR FOR WEEKS AT THIS POINT. IN THE AMENDMENT THAT THE PROPOSED AGAIN IS BASICALLY AN EXEMPTION IT SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS. SO -- UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE SURPLUS LAND.
