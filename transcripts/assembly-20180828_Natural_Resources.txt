I'D LIKE TO GET THIS A COMMITTEE HEARING STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE WE HAVE. BOTH THE SIDES OF THE AYE REPRESENTED IN SO WELL. SEVERAL AYE CASKEY WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE YEAH GOOD GOOD GOOD EVENING AND WERE BACK ON S. B. ONE SIXTY EIGHT THAT LIKE TO THINK OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. UP WHAT WE HAVE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- IN IN PRINT WE WAS A COMBINATION OF WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF ARE. NOW WITH OUR SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE WE WANNA MAKE SURE THINGS GET DONE -- QUICKLY SO THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE USE BASICALLY LIMITED PLASTIC BEVERAGE AYE CONTAINERS WE'VE REMOVED OF THE OPPOSITION FROM THEY THAT CAN MANUFACTURES INSTITUTE IN THE CLASS. PACKAGING INSTITUTE IT ALSO THE BILL BEFORE YOU DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER CONTAINERS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE CRV. I'M WE'VE STRENGTHENED THE ENFORCEMENT BY MAKING VIOLATIONS UP PER DAY PENALTY TRULY INCENTIVIZING THE INDUSTRY TO ACHIEVE OR EXCEED THESE MINIMUM CONTENT. US STANDARDS THE MINIMUM 20% CONTACT REQUIREMENT FOR PAT IS COMPLETELY FEASIBLE -- AS A STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT THREE STATISTICS SAY THAT WE USE FOR THE TH FORTY THOUSAND TONS ARE RECYCLED PET IN. THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO ACHIEVE A 20% WE NEED ROUGHLY EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS. OF OF PAT AND THE STATE GENERATES ALMOST TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS IN SALES OF PET ANNUALLY SO -- ASSUMING ZERO INCREASES IN RECYCLING AND AND ZERO INCREASES IN PROCESSING -- AT CAPACITY WE ARE RECYCLING AND PROCESSING ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A FURTHER IN EUROPE COCA COLA HAS COMMITTEE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF RECYCLED. AND RENEWABLE MATERIAL IN THEIR PLASTIC BOTTLES FROM 25% 240% BY TWENTY TWENTY SO NOT THAT WE HAVE TO BE LIKE THE EUROPEANS BUT I THINK IT DID IT ADDRESSES THE FEASIBILITY. LET ME BE A CLEAR ON THE INTENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME. WE WANT TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE RECYCLING MARKETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THAT I HAVE A COUPLE WITNESSES WHO ARE WELL KNOWN TO THE COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE -- THEY'RE A BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE ALREADY FAR EXCEEDING THE PROPOSED 20%. THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IN CALIFORNIA LITERATE 0% RECYCLED CONTENT WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY SO REPORTING. THE VOLUME OF RECYCLE CONTENT TO CAL RECYCLE SO WE ALREADY HAVE THAT INFORMATION. ANTICIPATING THE LATEST OPPOSITION THE LATEST POINT FROM THE OPPOSITION THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH RECYCLE CONTENT IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE 20% -- THAT IS NOT TRUE THERE IS. ENOUGH FOOD GRADE RECYCLED PET RECYCLE P. ET BEING GENERATED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY TO MEET AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT. A 45% RECYCLED CONTENT THAT MATERIAL RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO FOOD GRADE UP PRODUCE PACKAGING THAT. LOCAL CONTENT IS AVAILABLE AND THAT FOOD GET GREAT RECYCLE CONTENT MATERIAL IS CHEAPER RIGHT NOW THEN THE VIRGIN MATERIAL. THIS MEASURE WILL CREATE UP A LOGICAL PROGRESSION BOMB JUST LIKE WE DID WITH GLASS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WE SET UP A 25% AND THEN 35% RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENT. FOR THE GLASS CONTAINER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO NOW TODAY THE GLASS INDUSTRY IS EXCEEDING THAT WITH 50% RECYCLED CONTENT FOR GLASS BOTTLES MADE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE GLASS THAT'S BEING. SOLD TO THOSE CLASS MANUFACTURES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CHEAPER THAN THE GLASS THAT IS BEING PURCHASED BY MANUFACTURES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO TRUTH TO THE NOTION. THAT THIS RECYCLED CONTENT MANDATE IS GOING TO INCREASE THE COST FOR THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. VERSION AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR AND AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING DINNER -- I REPRESENT CPR SEE IF THE CALIFORNIA PLASTIC RECYCLING COALITION IT MAKES UP NOW FIVE IT WAS SIX OF THE LARGEST PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR PROPER ASSESSORS AND RE KLEBER'S. THEY TAKE THE BOTTLE AND THEY MAKE IT INTO A NEW PRODUCT TO BE MADE INTO ANOTHER BOTTLE SO THAT THE CLOSE OF THE LOOP. I WILL TELL YOU WITHOUT MINIMUM CONTENT AND I'VE BEEN DOING LOBBYING FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS YOU'LL LOSE THE OTHER FIVE THEY CANNOT MAKE IT. THEY NEED TO HAVE THEY'VE MADE IT MILLIONS IN INVESTMENTS IN MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. INCLUDING MISTER FLOORS. AND THEY HAVE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PUTTING TOGETHER THEIR PROCESSING PLACES TO ACTUALLY DO THIS WORK THAT MAKES BOTTLES INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT TO BE RECYCLED R. P. T. BOTTLE. THEY CAN'T TAKE THE LOSSES THAT HAVE CONTINUOUSLY WITH THE MANUFACTURERS USING VIRGIN -- VIRGIN PLASTIC FROM CHINA SO WE URGE IN AYE -- I WILL JUST END WITH SAYING THAT MOST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL -- HAVE ALREADY SAID IN EUROPE THEY CAN DO FIFTY BY. TWENTY TWENTY AND SOME OF THEM CAN DO FIFTY OR FORTY BY THIS YEAR IN SUMMER DOING A HUNDRED SO TO ASK THEM TO DO 20% IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN ALL OF THIS IS JUST GOING TO GO INTO LANDFILLS AND WATER IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE? THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. HOMES CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES. IBM AS IS POINTED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- THE POLICIES IN CHINA HAVE CUT OFF THAT MARKETPLACE IN THERE. FOR THE MARKET FOR THIS KIND OF FORCE OF PLASTIC AS WELL AS OTHER RECYCLED MATERIAL HAS DROPPED. PRECIPITOUSLY. OF THIS MEASURE -- WILL BRING BACK SOME OF THAT DEMAND I WILL POINT OUT THAT OUR COMPANY IS LOSING ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH IN OUR RECYCLING BUSINESS. AND THIS WOULD BE A AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO BRING THAT MARKET BACK WE'D URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. JEFFREY FANNED OUT OF EVERY PLANET IN SUPPORT. GEN A PRICE WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS SUPPORT. THANK YOU TO CREDIT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. JEAN AROUND BEHALF WASTE MANAGEMENT WE SUPPORT I'D NATIONAL SORT IS UPENDED EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO THIS THANK YOU. I CAROLINA'S HIGHER ANTI ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA THE COMPUTER CAN. CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEARCH ACCOUNTS ON SUPPORTING THE QUEUE. TENTATIVE OUT ON ON BEHALF OF SURFRIDER FOUNDATION HEAL THE BAY AND THE REST OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR THE CHAIRMAN EMERITUS ET AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FREDRICKA MCGEE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION. AND TODAY UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE REMAINING AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO INCREASE RECYCLED CONTENT THE NUMBER THAT WAS PROVIDED ABOUT COKE IS ACTUALLY TWENTY THIRTY AND NOT. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THEIR 50% OUR GOALS OUR INDUSTRY HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ALLOWED FOR THE RE USE OF RECYCLED CONTENT. NOT ONLY FOR PLASTIC BUT ALUMINUM FOR GLASS UMP THE RECYCLED MATERIALS ARE FEET SACH. FOR IT NOT JUST NEW BEVERAGES BUT ALL -- CUTS THE PACKAGES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS -- WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE BEVERAGE AND IT OFF TO ON ON INCREASING ARE RECYCLED CONTENT. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE ARBITRARY NUMBER THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY PUT INTO ESPY'S AT SIX ONE SIXTY EIGHT IS NOT BASED ON ANY DATA OR A REAL RESEARCH -- IT COULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT MARKET DISTORTION AND RECYCLED PET CHAIN AND ADDITIONALLY DISRUPT THE FLOW OF RECYCLED PET FOR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I UNDERSTAND WILL WELL BEYOND THE DEADLINE DATE FOR DOING AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND TRUST ME WE HAVE TRIED REPEATEDLY WITH NO SUCCESS TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR AND A STAFF -- BECAUSE AUTHOR HAS DECLINED TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE WE'RE HOPING THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD CONSIDER HOLDING THE BILL TODAY. WHEN THE BILL WAS GUIDED AND AMENDED IN JANUARY TO BE THE MANDATORY MINIMUM CONTENT LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION DATE WAS JANUARY TWENTY ONE WITH CAO RECYCLE SETTING THAT DAY -- IN THE LAST THREE LEGISLATIVE DAYS THAT DATE HAS MOVED TO JANUARY TWENTIETH ATTENUATE TWENTY TWENTY WITH A 20% -- LEVEL. THE ABRUPT CHANGE HAS WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH ANY OF THE OTHER -- OPPONENTS OPPOSE STAKEHOLDERS ARE WITH A BEVERAGE INDUSTRY ARM OR WITH THE CONTAINER MANUFACTURERS TO DETERMINE IF THIS DATE COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED IS IS REALLY UNREASONABLE -- BASED ON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DATA FROM CARRY CYCLE 20% OF THE CRV PET BOTTLES TOPIC BOTTLES WITH EQUAL A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION POUNDS -- THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NUMBER WOULD GO UP TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION POUNDS. NATIONWIDE ACCORDING TO THE CONTAINER RECYCLING ACTIVITY REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NATIONWIDE THERE IS ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION. POUNDS OF FOOD GRADE. BOB OUR P. T. THAT IS ONE THIRD CALIFORNIA WOULD CONSUME A THIRD OF THE NATIONAL RPG THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR FOOD GRADE AND I KNOW THE PROPONENTS SAY A WE HAVE PLENTY. BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. OUR PET THAT IS NOT FOOD GRADE THERE'S PLENTY OF NON FOOD GRADE OUR PET AVAILABLE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION TIMES OF OF OF THAT AND ACCOUNTS OF THAT ACTUALLY. BUT IT IS IT IS A LOT EXTRA WORK THAT A RECLAIMER HAS TO GO THROUGH TO GET TO A FOOD GRADE LEVEL THAT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR THE FDA TO ALLOW US TO RE USE IN FOOD GREAT PRODUCTS. I CALIFORNIA LEE KRAMER SAY THEY CAN MEET THIS GOAL BUT THEY THEY HAVE NOT DONE ANY STEPS TO SURE ASSURE US THAT THE FDA REQUIREMENTS COULD BE COMPLIED WITH -- THE ARBITRARY MAIN MANDATE CAN CAUSE. A SPIKE IN THE PRICES AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM SETTING THE PRICE IT ANY ABOUT THEY WANT WITH THIS MANDATE THERE. IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY GET THE ADDITIONAL [inaudible] BUDGET A PMDEEP PAYMENTS AND SO IT SEEMS TO US THAT THERE'S AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT HERE -- WE HAVE ONE OF OUR SMALL BOTTLERS IN THE MODESTO AREA BARNEY BROTHERS WHO SENT A LETTER TO THE ASSEMBLY YESTERDAY THAT SAYS THE LIFE. CYCLE OF THEIR BEVERAGES IS FROM FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEIR COMPANY TO PULL THE UNEXPIRED. PRODUCTS EXISTING PRODUCTS FROM THE SHELVES ON BY THE DEADLINE THAT'S PROPOSED IN TWENTY YOU KNOW FOR THE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. THERE'S CONTRADICTORY LANGUAGE THAT TALKS ABOUT THE THEIR EACH BOTTLE HAS TO HAVE 20%. OR THERE'S A MONTHLY AVERAGE IT'S NOT CLEAR EVEN FROM THE EXACT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. ANOTHER MIGHT BIG ISSUE IS MANY OF THE BOTTLERS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T MAKE THEIR OWN CONTAINERS AND THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. THAT THEY HAVE THAT AMOUNT IN THEIR CONTAINERS WHEN THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT PRODUCE IT THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH A DIFFERENT COMPANY BUT THEY ARE NOT THE ONE THAT PRODUCE IT. AND AGAIN THE PENALTIES ARE NOT CLEAR IN THE BILL THE SECTION THAT PREVIOUSLY REFERRED -- TO RESOURCE PUBLIC RESOURCES CO ONE FOUR FIVE NINE ONE SET DAILY FINES AND MAXIMUM THAT LANGUAGE HAS BEEN STRUCK FROM THE BILL SO WE'RE ON CLEAR IF IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY AT THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. IF IT'S PER VIOLATION IF IT'S PER STORE IF BIG BASS ON EACH BOTTLE SO NONE OF THAT IS CLEAR FROM THESE GET FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE WERE ASKING FOR YOU KNOW. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DON KEPT HIM HALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OPPOSED THE REASONS STATED THE CURE. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. KOREA BOSS SOME HALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS AS WE ARE IN SUPPORT -- PAUL GUYS FOR BEING LATE BUT JUST ONE GET THAT ON RECORD THANK YOU. SEEING NO ONE ELSE COMING FORWARD -- TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR ACOSTA. THANK YOU ARMCHAIR -- I CENTER EIGHT JUST ABOUT A COUPLE QUESTIONS WE THIS WILL DECIDE ADDRESS A QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT. OF THE 20% IS JUST MESSING IT MENTION IN PASSING WHAT WOULD HAVE THAT NUMBER COME FROM WILL CAME FROM THE HOUSE CYCLE WERE. FROM THE PLASTIC INDUSTRY HIS THEY'VE BEEN YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS HAD A PANEL OF OF OF PLAYERS TOGETHER FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN UPGRADE ON THE RECYCLING PROGRAM. DID THIS BILL ORIGINATED AS AND I'VE EXTEND THE PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I WATCHED OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS ALL THE PARTIES COME IN AND ONE PARTY WOULD MOVE HERE ONE PARTY WILL MOVE HERE [inaudible] A PLASTIC. CROWD HAS HAS SAID IS THAT THEY WANT A BENCHMARK THEY WANT 20% I'VE AVOIDED THAT MUCH. THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE TIME WITH THIS IN ALLOWED CAL RECYCLE WHEN IT WAS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE LAST TIME I SAID I WAS ELECTED EXPERTS -- PUT A BENCHMARK AYE IN BUT AS WE'VE SKINNY THAT THIS BILL HIVE ACQUIESCE TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR ON THE ON THE BATTERED AROUND [inaudible] FOR THREE YEARS. SO IT IT IT ISN'T FROM A STUDY OR THE UC'S ARE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WE WERE HARD NUMBER THAT'S COMPANIES THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT. WELL GEE WE'D LIKE TO SEE A NUMBER LIKE BECAUSE I KNOW I'VE HEARD THE NUMBERS FLOATING AROUND I'VE HEARD TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY AND WE CREDIT FOR A YEAR. ESPECIALLY SINCE FLOSSING YOUR TESTIFYING THAT CAME UP I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHERE THAT OTHER CAME FROM AND AND THEN AND I DON'T THE SURE IF THERE WAS A SOFT A STUDY BUT I KNOW IT WAS THE INDUSTRY WAS COMING UP. THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY WAS COMING UP WITH THAT NUMBER RIGHT IN THE BUT NOT BUT NOBODY IN ON THE OTHER SIDE THE MANUFACTURING SIDE THAT THAT THAT MEMBERS COUNCIL THEY HAVEN'T SAID HEY WE THINK WE CAN LIVE WITH. AND A NUMBER SO THIS. FOR MY WORDS NOT YOURS BUT THIS SEEMS A LITTLE BIT ARBITRARY IN THE SENSE THAT. INDUSTRY HAS TESTIFIED THAT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF OF THAT PART OF IT SO AT THAT DOES CONCERN ME A LITTLE BIT. BUT I I'LL I'LL MOVE ON BRIT BRIEFLY WHAT ABOUT THE ARM. THE BEVERAGE CANS ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE CONTENT AVERAGE IT IF IT IS THAT BIG IN THE BILL BECAUSE I I COULDN'T REALLY. FIND A HEART OF A FIRM NUMBER THERE IS IT PER BOTTLE IS IT. CAN WE AVERAGED IT WHAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS IS AVERAGE -- SO IT IS AN AVERAGE AMOUNT CURRENTLY THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY REPORTING TO CAL RECYCLE THE VOLUME OF VIRGIN AND THE VOLUME OF RECYCLED THE THIS BILL ASSUMES THAT SAME MEASURE ON SO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE PEPSI COLA IS ALREADY DOING 21% ON AVERAGE WE KNOW THAT NESTLE IS ALREADY DOING 42%. ON AVERAGE THIS BILL IS INCORPORATING THAT SAME CONCEPT WHICH IS AN EXISTING LAW OF A BEVERAGE -- THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY REPORTING. AND THE CAL RECYCLE CERTIFYING BASED ON AB SO SO TO CLARIFY FOR FROM MY MY MY SMALL BRAIN HERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW. AN INDUSTRY AVERAGE THEN COMPANY OUR COMPANY COMPANY AB AVERAGE OKAY COMPANY AS A EACH COMPANY HAS TO COMPLY SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S MONTHLY WEEKLY THAT WE COME ANNUALLY NOW OR JUST THE REPORT WHICH IS AN ANNUAL PORT. AYE I'M ASSUMING. REPORTING AS IT IS WITH CLASS THE REPORTING IS IN THE BILL IS MONTHLY IS MONTHLY A SAME ASSIDUOUS CURRENTLY WE'RE GOING OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WAS. TRYING TO GET AT SO THAT IT THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT SENATOR WE DON'T. WE DO WE HAVE TO COST CONTAINMENT THE BILL SEEMS TO BE MISSING FROM THIS THAT THAT THERE'S NO. GET I WOULD DISCUSS GUYS A LIMIT HERE IS THAT IS THAT THE FOR THE CASE HERE YES I GUESS I DON'T I DIDN'T BUILT ANY COST CONTAINMENT SAID NO THE PREMIER OBJECTIVE HERE. IS TO RECYCLE OUR PLASTIC MATERIAL OBSOLETE GOD SO THAT'S SO THAT'S THAT WE HAVE FIFTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THIS GOES LIVE SO THE WHOLE WORLD'S GOING TO KNOW. WHEN THEY BOTH A LEGISLATURE? MOVES MOVED TO SPELL I'M COMMITTED IF THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAN UP MY COMMITTEE IN THE BAR ON THE SENATE SIDE IS COMMITTED TO DOING ANY LEGISLATION IF THERE'S ANY DOUBT ON WHAT WERE. A ARE TRYING TO GET TO ACHIEVE HERE. WELL WHAT IF THE PRICE WERE DEAD. SAY DOT COM BACK TO THAT TWENTY TWENTY NUMBER THAT YOU AS MENTIONED AN IMMINENT LAST QUESTION BUT YOU EAT WHAT IF THE PRICE GOT OUT OF CONTROL WERE HOT WHAT WHAT WHAT THERE'S NO MECHANISM IN IN HERE FOR THAT SO IF THE DOUBLED OVERNIGHT ARE YOU SAYING THAT. WERE GONNA START BECOMING A NET IMPORTER OF THOSE ON A MATERIAL OR THE PRICES WILL WIN COUNTY THAT I CRAZY WHAT WHAT WE LISTEN HELL RECYCLE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET. CHANGE THIS AND THEY WILL INCLUDE THOSE THAT I'VE COSTS AS THEY SET THE STAMP IS THE STANDARDS GOING FOR SO CAL RECYCLE HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO MANDATE SOME FORM OF COST CONTAINMENT IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WELL NO I'M SAYING THAT WERE WERE SETTING THE FLOOR 20%. WE'VE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT COULD GO THE TWENTY TO TWENTY IS NOT DEALING FIVE BUT WHEN IF THEY GO UP. AS HE MOVED UP THEY HAVE THEY WILL INCORPORATE THE COSTS IN THE ANY FUTURE -- STANDARDS HIM OKAY ARE IN IN THE LAST POINT WHY DID WE THE BILL GO FROM MY ME YADDA 20% SOURCE A NUMBER. WHY DO WE GO FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY NOW THAT IT WAS MENTIONED EFORE WE TOOK OUT GLASS AND WE TOOK OUT ALUMINUM SO WE WE HAD WHEN WE FOCUSED ONLY ON PLASTIC AND WE BELIEVE? INTEREST IS THE TESTIMONY HAS BEEN THAT. INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES ARE REACHING THIS GOAL AND AS THE STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT WE RENDER LITTLE CRISIS WITH ALL THIS BILL THE PLASTIC IN AND MATERIAL THAT THE NATIONAL SOARED IS NOT TAKING THE CHINESE. ARE MATERIAL IS PACKING NOW AND WE NEED -- TO INCENTIVIZE THE INDUSTRY TO START RECYCLING ARE MORE FOR PLASTIC THAT WE DO IN A REAL GOOD JOB ON SOME OF IT WE HAVE TO GET CLEANER PRODUCT AND MORE PLASTIC. ARE INVOLVED IN THE STRING. WELL WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND LOOK LIKE WE ALL WANT TO GET AS MUCH. MATERIAL OUT OF OUR LANDFILLS AS POSSIBLE I AND I FOR ONE DO I HAVE A OF A NUMBER OF TWELVE LANDFILLS IN MY DISTRICT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. A PUBLIC POLICY AS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DRILLING DOWN I I CAN'T SUPPORT IT IN ITS CURRENT FORM TODAY I OF THIS TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS I DON'T LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF THE DATE I DON'T LIKE. THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO COST CONTAINMENT AND THE SKY'S THE LIMIT IN TERMS OF PRICING I APPLAUD WORRY HER. WERE TRYING TO GO UP BUT THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GET TO THE ROOT OF SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU MAY BE HERE SENATOR AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS ARE. THERE ARE. YOU KNOWN FORMALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MEMBERS WERE OUT TO CHIEF HERE. RUPTURED YOU HERE ACOSTA.

KOWSKI FOR A PUTTING FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL IDEA I'M. MY I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE DETAILS COULD BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THE REGULATIONS FROM CAL RECYCLE -- AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION WILL. RISE TO THE CHALLENGE SO MUCH IS MADE AND SECONDED DRINK RIGHT -- CENTER WAS ON CLOSE OUT JUST A NOTE THAT I I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO DELAYED THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF I SP ONE SIXTY EIGHT AND THAT IS TO GIVE THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. WOULDN'T NOTICE TODAY THAT IN FIFTEEN MONTHS WE'RE GOING TO SAYS WE'RE GOING TO EXPECTED EVERY BEVERAGE PRODUCER TO IT THAT WE ARE COUNTING ON TO SUPPORT THE RECYCLING MARKETS EQUAL 220%. OF THE PET PASSED PLASTIC PACKAGING PACKAGING THAT WE INTEND THAT THEY INTEND TO SELL HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THAT AYE DIVERGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MOTIONS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED CHAIRS RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THAT INSECT RIPLEY'S CALDERON. ITEM TWO SP ONE SIXTY EIGHT BY SENATOR WIECKOWSKI THE MOTION IS TO PASS. MEMBERS WERE OUT TO KILL AYE MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA NO ACOSTA KNOWN CHAU. CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO LIMON [inaudible] MCCARTY MELENDEZ [inaudible] REYES. REYES AYE STONE. STONE AYE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AND MEMBERS. SO WHEN YOU. THE BILL IS ON CALL. NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR ROTH PRESENTING SP ONE TWENTY AND CO PRESENTING IS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN [inaudible] I DON'T. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M OF PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE THIS EVENING WITH A ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN TO PRESENT THE SENATE BILL ONE TWO ZERO ONE TWENTY IT'S A BILL TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS FOR A STATES DESERT'S BY CREATING A REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE STATE TO ASSESS. PROPOSALS TO EXPORT DESERT GROUNDWATER TO OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. I SHOULD -- START BY SAYING THAT I'M CERTAINLY NOT ONE FOR LAYERING ON UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY IN PERMITTING PROCESSES KNOW OR IN MY ACTUALLY KNOWN AS ENVIRONMENTALISTS AROUND HERE AS EVIDENCED BY MY VOTE RECORD. BUT I THINK THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR GREATER STATE OVERSIGHT OF PROJECTS THAT SEEK TO STATE TAKE WATER OF THE DESERT AND SEND IT TO URBAN AREAS. THAT'S WHY WHEN IT WAS FRANKLY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE IS THIS PROJECT THAT'S PROPOSING TO EXTRACT ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER ANNUALLY FROM BENEATH THE MOJAVE DESERT. AND EXPORT THE WATER TO WATER AGENCIES THEM SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN WHEN THE AS POINTED OUT THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY INDICATED THAT IT CAN ONLY SUSTAIN A MAXIMUM OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. AND THEN WHEN THE PROPONENTS OWN PROPOSAL REFLECTS A DISCHARGE RATE OF ABOUT. FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PRE YEARS AGAINST TO RECHARGE RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND FEET PRE HERE. I BEGAN TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ESSENTIALLY ABDICATED ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC LANDS IN THE MOJAVE. THROUGH WHAT TYPICALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A NEPA PROCESS. I THINK THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE OF THE REVIEW THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO TAKE PLACE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IS COMPLETED BEFORE AUTHORIZING A PROJECT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT. SUCH A FRAGILE ECO. FURTHERMORE CONSIDERING THE CONFLICTING ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT CAN BE SUSTAINABLY EXTRACTED. WELL AS PROVIDED THE KIDDIES THE PROJECTS APPLICANTS AND OTHER OF SCIENTISTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OWN FIGURES -- FRANKLY IN MY OPINION THE STATE MUST CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. FOR AND ALSO TO RESOLVE THE SCIENTIFIC A CONFLICT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN SCIENTISTS. BEFORE ALLOWING THE EXTRACTION OF WATER FROM THIS -- DESERT TO UPPER. FOR NOW. I'M NOT TRYING TO PREVENT THE PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS SOCK FOR HIM TO BE CLEAR ON THAT. BUT I THINK WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW IS COMPLETED AND THAT THE SCIENCES RECONCILED. IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THIS OR ANY SIMILAR EXTRACTION PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. NOW WE CAN AND WE SHOULD DO IT QUICKLY. BUT WE MUST DO IT. I THINK AT THIS POINT OF I WILL TURN THE MIKE OVER MICROPHONE OVER TO MY A CO AUTHOR. SIMPLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. FOR HER COMMENTS WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIR YES PLEASE THANK YOU ARE THE SENATOR DID AN EXCELLENT JOB SUMMING UP. OUR POSITION -- WE ARE FRANKLY US SITTING HERE AGNOSTIC AS TO HOW MUCH WATER CAN SAFELY BE DRAWN OUT OF THIS BASIN BUT GIVEN THAT ARE DESERT IS VERY PRECIOUS. AND IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER SIGMA WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THE CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT ONCE WE KNOW THAT ONCE OP OFFERS ARE OVERDRAWN THEY DO NOT RECOVER. AND THIS THIS OP OR FOR IS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF WATER FOR ALL REFERRED ARE. MOJAVE NATIONAL RESERVE AND LOTS OF OTHER PROTECTED LANDS SO WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE DO. AND GIVEN THAT THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN A FEDERAL AGENCY. ARM AND THIS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE PREVIOUS FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RECHARGE IN THE BASIN AND GIVEN THE CHANGING HYDROLOGY IN THE DISTRICT BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS TO HELP TO RECONCILE THOSE NUMBERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER IS DRAWN IS SAFE FOR THE AREA. THAT SHOULD BE OUR TOP PRIORITY TIRED THIS BILL I THINK IS A VERY REASONABLE STEP TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOTE AQUIFER IS NOT OVERDRAWN. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU YOU HAVE WITNESSES AND SUPPORTS. CHAIRMAN MARC MURATSUCHI AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS NEIL THE SITE HERE WITH THE NATIONAL PARKS CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT SP ONE TWENTY A BILL TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIA DESERT. A PLACE THAT CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN HOLD DEARLY. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN AND PCA IS A LEADING. NATIONAL INDEPENDENT VOICE FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR NATIONAL PARKS FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE SEE THE MOJAVE. THANKSGIVING WE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DESERT AS AN ASSET WORTHY OF CONTINUED INVESTMENT. WE HAVE WORKED WITH GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT ICONIC LANDSCAPES. SUCH AS JOSH TREE AND THAT VALLEY [inaudible] AND MOJAVE. THIS IS PAYING OFF LITERALLY. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THESE PROTECTED PARKS GENERATED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT. FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CREATED OVER THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED ANNUAL SUSTAINABLE JOBS. AND OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN LABOR INCOME. WILDLIFE SUCH AS BIGHORN SHEEP KIT FOX AND DESERT TORTOISE HAVE FOUND REFUGE IN RESTORED LANDSCAPES. AND RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES HAVE BEEN CREATED TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE MILLION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS WITHIN A HALF THE DRIVE OF THE ASSASSINATIONS. BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO PILLAGE WHAT WE HAVE BUILT UP OVER GENERATIONS. DO THE KITTIES PANTHER KIDDIES GROUNDWATER MINING PROJECT IT BACKS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED THIS PROJECT UNDER BOTH FEDERAL NEPA REVIEW. BUT THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN EVENTS RATED BY THE CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE PROJECT WILL NOW ESCAPE THE FEDERAL RIVER REVIEW THAT HAS BEEN REQUIRED SINCE THE PROJECT WAS FIRST PROPOSED TWENTY YEARS AGO. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REMOVAL OF THE GOAL POST. COULD THESE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY FEDERAL SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. AND THE U. US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY. TWO OF OUR NATION'S MOST SITE RESPECTED SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS. THE SCIENTIFIC AGENCIES CAME CAME TO FIND MUCH DIFFERENT RECHARGE RATES THAN WHAT THE PROJECT PROPONENTS CLAIM. BY THE USGS IS UP FINDINGS THE PROJECT WITH PUMP UP TO TWENTY FIVE TIMES MORE WATER. THAN IT'S RECHARGED. THERE MUST BE BOUNDARIES TO POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEGLIGENCE. S. B. ONE TWENTY AFFECTIVELY RESTORES ORDER. IN SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING THAT WE'VE USED FOR DECADES TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR PUBLIC LANDS PRIOR TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS KIM DELFINO AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE REPRESENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. A WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT WHERE THE ORGANIZATION THAT SUCCESSFULLY LISTED THE DESERT TORTOISE AS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES BACK IN. NINETEEN NINETY SO WE HAVE WORKED FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT -- AS YOU'VE HEARD THE KIDDIES VALLEY IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE IT'S LOCATED IN THE MOJAVE SOUTH OF THE MOJAVE PRESERVE A AND HISTORIC ROUTE. SIXTY SIX AND EAST OF TWENTY NINE PALM PALMS MARINE BASE -- ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE THE AQUIFER THAT THE KIDDIES CORPORATION PROPOSES TO MINE. EXTENDS INTO THE NEWLY CREATED MOJAVE TRAILS NATIONAL MONUMENT AND THE MOJAVE NATIONAL PRESERVE THIS AQUIFER. SUSTAINS MANY DESERT SPRINGS AND PLANTS THAT ARE ICONIC THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ICONIC DESERT WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING TORTOISE BIGHORN SHEEP. MAPI FRINGE TOED LIZARD AND KIDS BOXES. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE KIDDIES CORPORATION PROPOSES TO UNSUSTAINABLY MINE THIS DESERT AQUIFER BY PUMPING. FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF GROUND WATER EVERY FOR FIFTY YEARS. THAT SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS OF WATER WORTH FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE GALLONS PER SECOND. THE PROJECT IS UNSUSTAINABLE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO PUMP MORE WATER FROM THE AQUIFER THEN IS REPLACE NATURALLY. A IN WITHIN THE WATERSHED AND AS ALREADY NOTED THE ESTIMATES FROM THE U. U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY SHOW THAT THE RAIN AND SNOW WITHIN THE AQUIFER'S WATERSHED UNIT. RESTORE IS ONLY BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. SUPPOSED TO THE FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO UP PUMP OUT. A THIS IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONLY FIVE AND 25% OF WHAT HE'S SAYING THEY'RE GONNA POP. THE RESULT OF THE UNSUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MINING WILL MEAN THAT THE WATER TABLE IS GOING TO DROP IN THIS AREA. AND THAT WILL DRY UP THE SPRINGS AND IT ALSO KILL OFF ALL OF THE TREES AND VEGETATION AND THAT THE ROOTS STONES THAT GO DOWN WITH THIS WATER TABLE. AND THE PROJECT ITSELF SAYS IT'S GOING TO BE DROPPING THE WATER TABLE -- THEY'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF BROWN WATER MINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN CALIFORNIA YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOOK TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE. A SEVERELY OVER DRAFTING AN AQUIFER. THESE IMPACTS WILL BE MORE SEVERE WITH IN THE DESERT. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE ANNUAL RAINFALL IS ABOUT TWO AND A HALF INCHES PER YEAR. AND YESTERDAY CALIFORNIA RELEASED ITS FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. WHICH SAID THAT BASICALLY THE DESERT IS ONLY GOING TO BECOME HOTTER AND DRIER WHICH MEANS THESE TYPES OF WATER SOURCES ARE ONLY GOING TO BECOME MORE AND MORE CRITICAL. THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IT CLEAR OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT THE TIME OF DRAINING OUR AQUIFER'S UNSUSTAINABLY IS OVER. WE JUST PASSED THE SERVICE GROUND MY SERVICE -- GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT. AND THAT'S WE MUST BE MANAGING OUR WATER SOURCES MORE SUSTAINABLY. SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT POLICY IT WOULD PROTECT OUR DESERT'S AND PARTICULAR PUBLIC LANDS BY CREATING A DEFINITIVE PROCESS BUT STATE TO ASSESS THE PROPOSALS TO EXPORT DESERT GROUND. TO OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. TO QUOTE SENATOR FEINSTEIN WHO IS A STAUNCH OPPONENT TO THIS PROJECT. PROJECTS LIKE KIDDIES PUT PUBLIC PROP PRIVATE PROFIT OVER PUBLIC LANDS BELONG TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND REMEMBER THIS PROJECT IS ONLY ALIVE RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION AND BECAUSE THE ONE OF THE LEAD OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE KIDDIES CORPORATION. IS NOW CURRENTLY THE NUMBER 2% OVER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. AND WHO REVERSED THE SOLICITORS OPINION THAT WAS GOING TO REQUIRED NEPA ANALYSIS AS PART OF THE RIGHT OF WAY OVER BLM LAND THAT THIS OF THE PROJECT WAS GOING TO HAVE TO OBTAIN. AS EVERYONE SHALL ANY DIRECT RAP YEAH I'M I'M LITERALLY IN THE HOME STRETCH RIGHT NOW. AS YOU ONE TINY OFFERS A VERY CLEAR CHOICE YOU SHOULD STAND WITH CALIFORNIANS AND PROTECT OUR PUBLIC LANDS OR STAND WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION WHO VALUES OF PLANS ONLY FOR THEIR ABILITY TO EARN PROFITS FOR THEIR FRIENDS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PILOT TREAT ON BEHALF OF BUT CHIANG AND THE COLUSA TRIBES. IN ADDITION JACOB HERE COULDN'T BE HERE I'VE TWO SENTENCES TO READ -- KIDDIES POSES FAR TOO GREAT A RISK TO THE CALIFORNIA DESERT WILDLIFE AND THE NEEDY FOR PEOPLE'S WHOSE CULTURES AND WELL BEING ARE AN EXTRA BIT EXTRA CUP. AND STRICT BLEED LINKED WITH THE HEALTH OF THE DESERT. TASKS AND THEREFORE STANDS IN WHOLEHEARTED OPPOSITION TO THE MISGUIDED KIDDIES PROJECT AND CALLS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PERFORM INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THIS PROJECT [inaudible] PLEASE SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK. A GOOD EVENING CAO JONES WITH URKEL CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSION A PRICE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS. THIS IS A THREE DECADE OLD PET PROJECT FOR A COUPLE OF RICH SHAREHOLDERS IS UNNECESSARY IS COSTLY ENVIRONMENTALLY DEGRADING. AND ITS ENERGY INTENSIVE WE ARE DRIVE OUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY. AND WATER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES NEEDS TO BE RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT THE KIDDIES PROJECT AS NEITHER OF THESE THINGS THE STATE SIMPLY MUST UP REVIEW AND ASCERTAIN THAT WE ARE DRY VOTE. ONE OF THE MEN ON A WITHOUT OF ON CALIFORNIA YOU STRONG -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE A WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. IT GOOD POLICY DOESN'T MEAN UP PUMPING. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MARK FENCED MAKEUP HALF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL THAT ALONE THOUGH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OF THE KATHLEEN THEY PLANT SOCIETY AS WELL AS A SOON IN STRONG SUPPORT. KIM SHRINER POP THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN STRONG SUPPORT THINK YOU. ELENA ORTIZ ON BEHALF OF MOJAVE DESERT LAND TRUST AND SUPPORT THINK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES THAT OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE GOING TO GET TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SO SCOTT WHICH A BEHALF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PIPE TRADES. FIRST OF ALL WHERE THE WITNESSES CALLED THIS POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY IS A BILL THAT WASN'T THAT WAS AMENDED ON FRIDAY FOUR DAYS AGO. WHY WASN'T THIS AROUND IN JANUARY WHY NOT NEXT YEAR THIS IS A PROJECT HAS BEEN AROUND? FOR TWENTY YEARS. AN I TAKE EXCEPTION TO SOME TO SAYING THAT IT'S FOR A FEW TEMPORARY JOBS. THESE ARE JOBS UNION JOBS SIX THOUSAND UNION JOBS IT WILL MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS WITH SOME OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AMONGST OUR MEMBERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PROJECT THAT HAS GONE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IT'S FOLLOWED EVERY STEP THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PROJECT GO THROUGH. HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT MULTIPLE TIMES AND SUCCEEDED IN IN MITIGATING IN A MEETING EVERY ISSUE. AND NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR FOLKS WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THIS PROJECT AND THREATEN. IT'S THOUSAND UNION JOBS. IF THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PROCESS. LETS HAVE A THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS NEXT YEAR BRING YOU BACK IN JANUARY. THERE'S NO REASON TO AMEND IT FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE END OF SESSION THREATENING SIX THOUSAND UNION JOBS WE WOULD URGE AND OVER [inaudible] CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- IF THE OPPORTUNITY WITH YOU TODAY I'M JIM LEACH WITH THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT WHERE THE LEAD AGENCY THE LEAD PUBLIC AGENCY ON THE KITTIES PROJECT? SUBJECT OF THIS BILL -- WE WERE HERE LAST YEAR ABOUT AB ONE THOUSAND ROACHES THIS BILLS PREDECESSOR AND IT WAS A GOT THE MEN BILL ROLLED OUT LATE IN THE SESSION -- IT WAS ON SUSPENSE UNTIL FRIDAY OF LAST WEEK -- WHEN IT EMERGED AND SO REGRETTABLY WHAT WE HAVE AGAIN THIS YEAR IS ANOTHER GOT THEM IN BILL ROLLED OUT THE LAST MINUTE? THAT I HAD INDICATED HAS ONE TARGET ONE PROJECT THE KIDDIES VALLEY WATER CONSERVATION RECOVERY STORAGE PROJECT. SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE ANY GROUND WATER. WE POUR ALL OUR DRINKING WATER SUPPLY FROM METROPOLITAN. I ONE OF OUR BOARDS CONTINUING CONCERNS THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLY LONG TERM. IT'S PROJECTS PLANNED TO BE A PART OF OUR SUPPLY PORTFOLIO BUT LOOKING BEYOND OUR SERVICE AREA. THE WATER WILL ALSO BE PUT TO BENEFICIAL USE FOR OTHER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS IT'S A SUPPLY WATER THAT WILL OTHERWISE EVAPORATE. ON THE DRY LAKE BEDS IN MOJAVE DESERT. THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN THROUGH THE RIGOROUS SEQUEL PROCESS IT WAS ULTIMATELY CERTIFIED UNANIMOUSLY BY OUR BOARD. WE'VE ENJOYING THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNADINO IN REVIEWING AND ULTIMATELY APPROVING ALONG WITH THE COUNTY. THEIR GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT MONITORING A MITIGATION PLAN. THAT ENSURES CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THE HEALTH INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE BASE IN THE WATER. PROJECT IS BEEN EXTENSIVELY LITIGATED APPEALED AND HAS PREVAILED IN EACH AND EVERY CASE AN INSTANCE. IN SPITE OF CAREFULLY FOLLOWING THE RULES AND PROCESS AS WE NOW HAVE S. B.. ONE TWENTY WITH THIS ROUND. I WHICH REQUIREMENT FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF REVIEWS. AFTER THE SECRET PARTS OF THE MET. IT'S BEEN SAID THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCIENCE FROM THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN ANSWERED THAT CAN ONLY BE ANSWERED IN ADDITIONAL REVIEW. SEQUEL WAS FOLLOWED INCOMPLETE AND WE HAVE TO ASK WHY THESE ADDITIONAL AGENCIES DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE ORIGINALLY I OUR PROCESS. WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE A CONCERN THAT THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE TWENTY WILL HAVE THE EFFECT CHALLENGING THE CREDIBILITY OF SEQUEL. US EAGLE REVIEWS IF OPPONENTS CAN GET ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE WITH THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION. THE LAST MINUTE GOTTEN AMEND APPROACH TO THIS AND OTHER ISSUES IS IN OUR VIEW AT THE VERY LEAST NOT APPROPRIATE. LEGISLATION THE COULD HAVE THIS KIND OF IMPACT SHOULD GO THROUGH THE REGULAR OF LEGISLATIVE PROCESS NEVER THE LAST. HERE WE ARE. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN TODAY IS THAT IT IS F. B. ONE TWENTY PASSES NEITHER THIS PROJECT NOR ANY PROJECT SUBJECT TO SEQUEL WILL BE SAFE FROM AFTER THE FACT LAST MINUTE INTRUSIONS INTO THE PROCESS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS IT WAS APPROVED AND LITIGATED. YIELDING RECHARGE WE MONITOR TO CONTROL BUT THE COUNTY OF SAN PORTANTINO WAS RESPONSIBLE AGENCY UNDER THEIR PLAN. THIS BILL TODAY IS NOT ABOUT MAKING SURE ALL THE TEES WERE CROSSED AND I'S WERE DOTTED THIS IS ABOUT MOVING THE FINISH LINE. WE URGE TO STOP THIS BILL NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT ON THIS PROJECT. BECAUSE THE LONG TERM HARM WE BELIEVE IT WILL COST TO THE CREDIBILITY THE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS AND FUTURE LAWFUL SEQUEL REVIEWS. WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT DUNCAN MCFETRIDGE REPRESENTING KIDDIES AT LIKE TO YIELD THE BALANCE OF MY TIME TO LESLIE MOULTON WHO -- PROVIDED THE SEQUINED ALICE'S AND CAN INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON JUST TO THE EXTENT OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE. NOT ONLY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BUT ON THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN AND I WOULD LIKE TO PUT ONE THING IN CONTEXT. THIS PROJECT AS A JACK TO WITHDRAW FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER A YEAR. BUT TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY MILLION ACRE FEET THAT UNDER LAYS. THE BASIN THIS WAS DONE IN A SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. WE URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. LESLIE MORTON POST WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATES PRESIDENT AND C. E. O. WHEN I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE SECRET PROCESS FOR THE KIDDIES WATER PROJECT. AND I THINK I JUST WANT TO HIT ON TWO POINTS AND THEN CERTAINLY BE AVAILABLE. FOR ON QUESTION SHOULD YOU HAVE THEM. ON THE QUESTION OF PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESS THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THIS HASN'T GONE THROUGH A THOROUGH STATE PROCESS BUT OF COURSE IT DID GO THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT PROCESS. WHICH TOOK ABOUT FOUR YEARS TO EXECUTE [inaudible] A A NUMBER OF AGENCIES FEDERAL STATE LOCAL REGIONAL WERE INVITED TO COMMENT DURING THE SCOPING PERIOD. OF INCLUDING THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME STATE LANDS COMMISSION CHOSE NOTTO PARTICIPATE FISHING GAME DID SUBMIT A LETTER AND ALSO. FURTHER SUBMITTED WHEN THEY DID REVIEW THE DRAFT HE AYE ARE A COMMENT LETTER. OF THE BLM THE U. S. B. ARE THE U. S. G. S. AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WERE ALL INVITED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS AND SOME OF THEM DIDN'T SOME OF THEM DID NOT -- OVER A HUNDRED SIX INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES AT THE STATE LOCAL FEDERAL REGIONAL LEVEL WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. SO THERE WAS A LOT OF THOROUGHNESS AND PROCESS INTEGRITY THAT OF COURSE IS REQUIRED. UNDER OUR STATE SECRET PROCESS. AND I DO THINK THAT PROCESS INTEGRITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF ON THE GROUND WATER RECHARGE -- DEBATE AND DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AMONG EXPERTS. THE E. I. R. TOOK -- I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT THOROUGH AND CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO LOOKING AT NOT ONLY WHAT. THE PROJECT SPONSORS INFORMATION SHOWED THAT THE RECHARGE WAIT WOULD BE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. BUT ALSO LOOKED AT SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR WHAT IF IT WAS HALF THAT. AND WHAT IF IT WAS ONLY FIVE THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. IT IS DIFFICULT -- TO HERE A CONTINUING REFERENCE TO THE VERY EARLY STUDIES THAT USGS DID THAT LANDED ON THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH MORE SITE SPECIFIC AND DETAILED INFORMATION AVAILABLE DONE UNDER THIS -- PROJECTS STUDIES SEVERAL YEARS OF SITE SPECIFIC GROUNDWATER MONEY MONITORING. WELL MONITORING TO GET REAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCALITY. A COMPLETELY NEW GROUNDWATER MODEL TO UPDATE AND HELP PROVIDE A MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED ANSWER. ALL OF THIS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE E. AYE OUR PROCESS FOR CRITIQUE AND REVIEW -- SO THE E. AYE ARE WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION TRIED TO LOOK AT SEVERAL SCENARIOS OF WHAT IF THERE IS A A DIFFERENT RECHARGE RATE [inaudible] AND MITIGATED FOR THOSE THAT IMPACTS AND A PERSON SPOKE EARLIER AND SAID YOU KNOW THE ISSUE IS GROUNDWATER PUMPING WILL DRAW DOWN THE GROUNDWATER AND THAT IS THE CHIEF. AGENT OF IMPACT INTO GROUNDWATER PUMPING SCENARIO SO. WE TOOK A LOOK AT UNDER ALL THOSE DIFFERENT A RECHARGE SCENARIOS THE FIVE THOUSAND THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET. WHAT WOULD THE LEVEL OF DRAWDOWN BE? AND WE FOUND THAT AT THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET. RECHARGE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PROJECT SPONSOR BELIEVES IS CORRECT. THE DRAWDOWN WOULD NOT EXCEED MORE THAN EIGHTY FEET OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT AND THAT THAT WOULD NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. SO THE COUNTY CAME IN AND UNDER THERE ARE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION SORT OF TOOK THE DEBATE OVER THE RECHARGE IT OF FACTOR. OFF THE TABLE AND JUST SAID WE'RE GOING TO SET A FLOOR. THAT YOU CANNOT DRAW THE WATER TABLE DOWN MORE THAN EIGHTY FEET. AND IF IF YOUR RECHARGE RATE WORKS OUT THEN YOU'LL GET THE YIELD YOU THINK AND IF IT DOESN'T YOU'LL GET LESS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BOTTOM LINE WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THE RESOURCES. BY JUST SETTING A PHYSICAL FLOOR ON HOW MUCH YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO DRAW DOWN UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AND A PROGRAM FOR YOUR PROJECT AND WE WILL MONITOR THAT AND WE WILL -- HAVE THE AUTHORITY WHICH IS IN THE PLAN. TO TELL YOU TO STOP PUMPING SHOULD YOU EXCEED ANY OF OUR PARAMETERS INCLUDING THE FLOOR DRAWDOWN. SO I JUST THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY THAT'S REALLY MY MOST IMPORTANT POINT. UP FOR THAT DEBATE AROUND THE RECHARGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS VERY QUICKLY ADAM CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. WANNA MAKE JUST A COUPLE QUICK POINTS -- WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS PROJECT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TAKE A POSITION ON WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE ADDITIONAL LAYER OF OF APPROVAL THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY THIS BILL THE PRESIDENT THAT THAT SETS -- IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE SEQUEL PROCESS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK ON THOSE WITH WITH BOTH AUTHORS BUT AMENDING A BILL THIS LATE IN THE SESSION THAT.

IN THE MISSION SPRINGS WATER DISTRICT THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF SETTING ADDITIONAL REVIEW AT THIS LATE HOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE -- COMMITTEE I I JUST WANTED. TO ADD TO THE RECORD IN THAT -- I HAD MET WITH THE THE SPEAKERS STAFF WAS SPEAKER HAS GONE ON RECORD IN OPPOSING THE PROJECT LAST YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN SENT A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF AB -- ONE THOUSAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SPELL WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THIS BILL -- AND ALSO WE HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS FROM. THE TEN A GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- AS WELL AS FROM UNITED STATES SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WITH THAT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR TELL. YOU VERY MUCH MISTER I JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION AND HOW MUCH IS THE PROJECT AT A COST AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE FINANCE AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR THE PAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS. THE PROJECT HASN'T REALLY PROFIT IT -- TO MENTION AND IN FACT IT'S INCUR A QUITE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES. IF NEITHER ONE OF US REPRESENT THE KIDDIES COMPANY THAT WE CAN'T IT TO HAVE. PARDON NOBODY KNOWS. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH ANYONE ME TO ANSWER HOW MUCH THE PROJECT IS GOING TO COST. I I AM IF THERE'S NO WITNESS SINCE I MEAN I I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL -- CALLS FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT YOUR BILL CALLS FOR THE THE RED OF YOU BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN HIGH ATLANTIC MISSION HAS HIS FEAR I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH PROJECT WHICH IS THE REASON I THE QUESTION WAS POSED TO THE OPPOSITION. ITS WE FIND OUT JUST WITHDRAW THAT QUESTION IF ANYONE KNOWS. SO IT APPEARS NEED NO ONE KNOWS OKAY. SHALL HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I'M I JUST THEIR READ SEVERAL ARTICLES THAT THAT. IT DESCRIBES SOME ISSUES WITH THE THE PROJECT. AND A AND I THINK ANY TIME WE WANT. TO YOU KNOW PLAY WITH THE ECO SYSTEM IN THE MOJAVE DESERT I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL. CEO ON SO DO YOU THE BUREAU POINT BEING THAT I THINK -- WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC LAND I THINK IT'S AN MAKE SENSE FOR US TO HAVE THE STATE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS? WITHOUT AYE I ACTUALLY WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. I JUST MADE AND SECOND. ANY FOR THE MISTER ACOSTA YEAH I JUST BURKE BRIEFLY FOR THE A DEPOSITION SO. JUST MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR US THIS IS GONE THROUGH A COMPLETE SECRET PROCESS A VERY LONG -- ARDUOUS PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE TRIED TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS AND THINGS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS HOW LONG WAS THE OVERALL. DOOR TO DOOR SEEKING PROCESS. WITH THE TECHNICAL WORK WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE WE STARTED THE OFFICIAL PROCESS BUT WE BEGAN WITH THE NOTE THE OFFICIAL NOTICE OF PREPARATION TWO THOUSAND TEN AND WE WERE CERTIFYING TWO YEARS LATER. GRETA THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FORM. TWENTY ONE TOP OF MS MELENDEZ. THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION AT THIS HOUR OF THE DAY I MUST TELL YOU I AM JUST CURIOUS IF -- MAYBE THE HYDROLOGISTS GEOLOGISTS SOMEBODY CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHY. WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO TAKE WATER FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AFFECT THE WATER SUPPLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL HAVE AN EFFECT. ON THE SUPPLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M JUST WONDERING THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND US WELL. I'M NOT THE HYDRO GEOLOGIST BUT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WE LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF THE ISSUE OF STATE WATER PLANNING IN THE CALIFORNIA WATER ACTION PLAN. WHICH ASKS FOR REDUCE DEPENDENCE IN NORTHERN ON THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL DELTA. AND SO THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOOK FOR REGIONAL SOLUTIONS -- TIP TO BOTH REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON THE SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA AS WELL AS THE COLORADO RIVER. SO THIS IS WITHIN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. REGION AS A CONTRIBUTION TO SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE TO COME UP TO BE TO BE FOUND FOR IT SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND ADDITIONAL SUPPLY. SO IT DID FURTHER STATE INTERESTS. IN IN TRYING TO DO THAT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] OTHER COMMENTS. SENATOR ROTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN WHICH I CLOSE. WELL I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE POINTS ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WAS MADE BY SEVERAL OF THE UMPS PRESENTERS AND OPPOSITION HAD TO DO WITH PRECEDENT AND YOU KNOW. WHILE I AM NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER I'M A LAWYER IN SO I TRULY VALUE THE CONCEPT OF PRECEDENT. BOTH IN THE LEGAL CONTEXT AND OTHERWISE. IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND IT WORKS WHEN THE PLAYING FIELD IS LEVEL WHEN THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT ARE FOLLOWED. IN WHEN THE PUBLIC HAS A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE HERE. OTHER WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUES WITH REGARD IN SAM DID YOU KNOW COUNTY -- AT THE BOARD LEVEL WITH RESPECT TO THE SELECTION OF THE LEAD AGENCY. I WON'T DON'T NEED TO GO INTO THOSE I DIDN'T SELECT THE AGENCY THE ULTIMATELY THE BOARD DID SELECT. OF THE WATER COMPANY IS A LEAD AGENCYI ALSO DON'T KNOW WHY. I MEAN THIS IS SCIENCE I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENCE IN AN INCORRECT SURROUNDING THIS PROJECT WERE NOT RESOLVED AT SOME POINT IN TIME. BUT I KNOW THAT THEY WERE NOT AND AS RECENTLY AS IN APRIL. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS HAVING TO DO WITH THIS PROJECT THAT. QUESTION SOME OF THE DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. SO THE CONFLICTS IN SCIENCE OR WHAT FRANKLY DROVE ME TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I TYPICALLY LABOR WANTS TO BUILD A PIPELINE WORKERS WANT JOBS AND DOWN WHERE I COME FROM AGENCIES WHAT WATER. AND I WANT ALL THOSE THINGS TOO BUT I WANT THEM IN ASSISTING NOBLE WAY. AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH THE RECHARGE RATE OF THIS BASIN% IS AND THE SCIENTISTS ALL AGREE. AND WE CAN'T DETERMINE WHAT THE DISCHARGE RATE COULD POSSIBLY BE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A SUSTAINABLE BASIS THIS AQUIFER UNDER A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF OUR STATE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME BECAUSE THE AGENCIES THAT WILL TAKE THIS WATER. THROUGH THE PIPELINE WE'RE GOING TO SOME OF THEM ANYWAY HERE GOING TO BE USING IT TO ENTITLE PROJECTS. AND HOOK UP WATER METERS AND IF YOU BUILD A HOUSE AND YOU HOOK UP A WATER METER AND YOU PROMISED THE RESIDENTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET WATER. THEN THE SOURCE OF THE WATER NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINABLE. SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT I WILL ALSO SAY IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING DURING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT PROCESS. IN COURT THE SCIENCE WAS NOT LITIGATED. THE SELECTION OF THE LEAD AGENCY WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT WERE LITIGATED BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE SCIENCE ITSELF WAS NOT LITIGATED IN COURT THERE WAS NO DETERMINATION AND LITIGATION OVER WHICH REPORT -- SHOULD BE RELIED ON AND WHY OTHERS SHOULD NOT AT LEAST THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE E. AYE OUR PROCESS. OTHERS CAN CORRECT ME BUT WHETHER WAS YOUR WASN'T THE FACT REMAINS. THAT WE HAVE SCIENTISTS THAT APPARENTLY DISAGREE. AND TO MAKE AN ERROR ON THIS. TO MAKE AN AIR ON THIS IF WE GET IT WRONG. WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE? FOR SO I SAY HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON. TAKE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME HOWEVER SHORT FIGURE OUT THIS SCIENCE RECONCILE THE SCIENCE DETERMINE A DISCHARGE RATE IN A RESEARCH RESEARCH RECHARGE RATE IT'S REASONABLE FOR THIS AQUIFER. AND THEN MOVE FORWARD I AM NOT OPPOSED TO PUMPING WATER OUT OF THE AQUIFER. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT AND WE DO IT IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ACCU. I THINK THE SENATOR -- HE VERY ELOQUENTLY STATED I THINK EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID [inaudible] SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND SO -- I WHY I JUST WANT -- TO A CONFIRMED A SENATOR THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A VOTE ON THE PROJECT ITSELF BUT THIS IS A A A A PROJECT A VOTE FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT.
