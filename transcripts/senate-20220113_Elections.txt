AND WITH THAT WE PRESENT TO GIVE YOU THE FLOOR HELLO LET ME MENTION BEFORE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES WERE GONNA LIMIT WITNESSES TO TWO MINUTES EACH. AND TOTAL TESTIMONY ON EACH SIDE TO TWENTY MINUTES SO THAT SENATOR BOB MAN WELCOME. AND YOU CAN BE YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND TO YOUR POINT MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY COMMITTEE STAFF. ON PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS TO CLARIFY THAT SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD APPLY TO ELECTIONS FOR SEATS ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. DO TO TIME CONSTRAINTS THESE AMENDMENTS WILL BE MADE IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS BASED ON A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION ONE THAT'S ACCEPTED AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION ARE CRITICAL IN CRITICALLY IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND THAT THEREFORE THE ELECTIONS FOR THE SHOULD BE HELD DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION CYCLE WHEN TURNOUT IS AT ITS HIGHEST RATHER THAN DURING A LOW TURNOUT PRIMARY AS IS THE PRACTICE IN ORANGE COUNTY TODAY. SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD BRING ORANGE COUNTY IN LINE WITH THE REST OF CALIFORNIA I WAS THERE ONLY FIVE COUNTIES INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BETTER BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTIONS DURING THE PRIMARY. NOW I'VE TALKED TO MANY CONSTITUENTS ARE CONFUSED OR FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECTION OF THEIR BOARD OF EDUCATION TRUSTEE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION. TURNOUT DIFFERENTIALS BETWEENPRIMARY ELECTIONS AND GENERAL ELECTIONS ARE STARK AS WE EXPECT IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND VOTERS PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION AS OPPOSED TO ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION VOTERS IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. AND NEARLY TWO FOLD INCREASE THESE TURNOVER DIFFERENTIALS ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES. IMMIGRANTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE. COUNTY BOARD. SIR CRITICAL. IN ARKHAM. I PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ISSUE DISTRICTS. EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTERS AREN'T FRANCHISE. BUT THEY'RE ENGAGED IN THE ELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS. CURRENTLY IN THE ARCHIVER EDUCATION HOLDS ELECTIONS FOR BOARD SEATS DURING THE PRIMARY. I AS I MENTIONED THAT IS LOWER AND THIS PRACTICE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. I THESE TURN OUT DIFFERENCES SHOALS ARE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED ON RACIAL ETHNIC MINORITIES. YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS AND IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT VOTERS. YOUNGER VOTERS BETWEEN AGES EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ASIAN AMERICAN LATINO VOTERS. I SEE A PARTICULARLY STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN PRIMARY VERSUS GENERAL ELECTIONS. SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THAT ELECTIONS FOR ORANGE COUNTY BOARD. OF EDUCATION BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. AND WOOD BASICALLY APPLY THE SAME ELECTION TIME LINES CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR ALMOST ALL OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION STATE. THIS IS A LOCAL ELECTION BILL THAT WOULD INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION. FOR A CRITICAL BODY AND WOULD REDUCE AND LET. BOATER CONFUSION BY CREATING UNIFORMITY AROUND THE TIMING OF ELECTIONS. ON THE LINE TO TESTIFYING SUPPORT WE HAVE BARBEL SHOWMAN SETTLE BACK VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER. AND ELIZABETH DORAN PARKER PAST PRESIDENT. OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD'S ASSOCIATION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR MEN SO LET'S GO YOUR LEAD WITNESSES- I DO PRESENTE IN ORDER OUT FOR YOUR- AND INVITING BARBER SHOREMEN FROM- TO SPEAK FIRST. THE SHOWMAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY NAME IS BARBARA SOWN AND BOARD MEMBER OF SADDLEBACK VALLEY. AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PASS SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY SIX FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL VOTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY. THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION RACE SHOULD BE HELD IN NOVEMBER INSTEAD OF WHEN THE PRIMARIES ARE. THE MAJORITY OF COUNTY OFFICES ARE IN THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION AND THEY'RE ALMOST 50% MORE VOTERS IN GENERAL ELECTIONS. AND PRIMARIES AND I BELIEVE THE ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION SHOULD BE ALSO. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT OFFICE AND IT DESERVES A HIGHER NUMBER OF PEOPLE CASTING BALLOTS. ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH HAVING THIS IMPORTANT ELECTION WANT THE PRIMARIES. IS IT MANY VOTERS DO NOT REALIZE THIS IS A ONE AND DONE RIGHT. THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE VOTING AND THE TWO CANDIDATES WITH THE HIGHEST VOTES WILL BE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. LIKE ALL OTHER RACES ON THE BALLOT WITH PRIMARIES BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE SENATORS. ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD WHICH REPRESENTS ALMOST THIRTY DISTRICTS SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER. I AM SAYING PLEASE AND THANK YOU AT THE SAME TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SHERMAN GO TO THE SECOND- THE WITNESS ELIZABETH DORAN PARKER PARKER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU TO YOU KNOW I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS AND HELD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS FOR ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS AT THE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL FOR THIRTY YEARS DO WE DO WITH KNOWLEDGE HOW LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ARE KNOWN ABOUT THE CRITICAL LEADERSHIP FOR. COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION THIRD WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM EXCEPT FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY SCHOOL. BOARDS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AS DEFINED IN AT COULD SECTIONS TEN FOURTEEN TEN FORTY TWO THE ONLY ELECTED BOARDS THE FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY IN JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR OUR COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. THE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOLS ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE THEY TEND TO INCLUDE A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF HOMELESS FOSTER YOUTH LGBTQ PLUS CHILDREN KICKED OUT OR DROPPED OUT THERE FOR THE NEW TRUSTEE TO CRY. YOUR EDUCATION SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS TO ENSURE OUR MOST AT PROMISE CHILDREN HAVE ELECTED BOARD OF EDUCATION TRUSTEE HYPER FOCUSED ON YOUR WELL BEING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTERS NEED TO ELECT THEM IN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR MOVING THE ELECTION FROM UKIAH VERY SOON OF EMBERS GENERAL ELECTION WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VOTERS ELECTING TRUSTEES FOR THESE CHILDREN. THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN'S LIVES IN TRADITIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITY AND MANY NEED BE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR THE MORE VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHALLENGES AND LIVED EXPERIENCES THE MORE LIKELY THEY WILL ELECT EDUCATIONAL WINGERS WHO UNDERSTAND AND PRIORITIZE THEIR NEEDS. WHEN I BEGAN MY TENURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION NONE OF US APPRECIATED HOW MUCH IT MATTERED WHO VOTED IN SAID THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE TRUSTEES. ADULT ADDING A VERY. PERSPECTIVE FROM MY KERR EXPERIENCE IT. IS NEAR AND- TO GO ANY REAL HE'S UNDER. HOW THIS RACE IS WHAT I REFERRED AS A AND DONE IN THE- BECAUSE OF RECORD. HELP RAY ARE THAT PRIME TO THE REAL WAY THE- THIS BILL WILL BE THAT ONE AND DONE A POOL OUTING ALL OF THE OTHER ONE AND DONE EDUCATIONAL BOARD GREAT IT'S- AN ORANGE COUNTY.

ALL RIGHT BARBARA THANK YOU WERE GOING TO BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO SENTIMENT RAMOS BUILT- IT VERY QUICKLY WANTTO NOTE THAT THE- COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IN THEORY- THERE SAID THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL REMEDY- UNDER EXISTING LAW- BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM HAVING BEEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. TO COUNTY BOARD OF ELECTIONS IN ORANGE COUNTY- FOR SOME TIME THAT THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN MALPRACTICE. LESS OF A BUG THAN A FEATURE OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND THAT IS WHY I'M GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY- AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE IT WHEN THE TIME TO APPROPRIATE. THAT ANY. OTHER MEMBERS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT- SENTIMENT THAT YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA I APPRECIATE THAT YOU NEVER THIS BILL TO- TO ORANGE COUNTY WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT OVER THE COURSE OF THE- PAST YEAR- THAT I'M- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. HI I THINK THAT THE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SHOULD GO TO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THEIR AREA AND YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE. HAPPEN I KNOW THAT- A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT ONE IS THAT. IT TYPICALLY WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SEE EFFORTS CONCRETE EFFORTS MADE TO MAKE THESE TYPES OF CHANGES ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT ANY MOTIONS BEEN PUT BEFORE THE BOARD. PASTOR DEFEATED TO- TO ADVANCE THIS AND THAT THAT'S ALWAYS AT MY VIEW OF. A BEST PRACTICE TO TRY TO. EXHAUST THOSE REMEDIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- SECOND AND THIS GOES BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AN ORANGE COUNTY BUT- I CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE THAT- AND NOVEMBER ELECTION HAS A MUCH GREATER TURNOUT. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COME OUT OF THAT. CIRCUMSTANCE ONE IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DROP OFF ON THE BALLOT FROM THE TOP OF THE BALLOT TO THE BOTTOM. AND I THINK THAT IN. MOST CASES IN GENERAL ELECTIONS YOU SEE A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF. DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVEN WITH THE DROP OFF THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL IS STILL GREATER IN A GENERAL ELECTION IT COULD VERY WELL STILL BE. GREATER BUT PART OF THE EASON THAT THAT THAT DROP OFF HAPPENS. IS BECAUSE THE- THE ATTENTION PAID TO THESE LOWER TIER OFFICES IN GENERAL ELECTIONS IS SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHED. AND THE COST OF CAMPAIGNING IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER. THE DALLAS IS POINTS OUT THE DIFFERENCE IN TURNOUT. AB TWEEN THE PRIMARY AND GENERAL IN ORANGE COUNTY AND IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S ALSO A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE COST OF CAMPAIGNING ON THAT JURISDICTION'S. WE COMPLAIN A LOT ABOUT THE MONEY AND POLITICS THIS MAKE IT EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. AND SO IT'S A CHALLENGE HOW DO WE GET GREATER COVERAGE OF THESE RACES. WITNESSES AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR MAKE IT CLEAR HOW IMPORTANT THIS ELECTION IS FOR THIS PARTICULAR POSITION- AND YT. WE STRUGGLE TO GET ANY ATTENTION. AND I THINK IF YOU SURVEYED THOSE WHO RUN FOR THE BOARD OF EDUCATION NOT JUST IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YOU'LL HEAR THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE IN GETTING THEIR MESSAGE OUT. IT'S A IT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE SO. I THINK THERE ARE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WE CONSOLIDATE- NEVERTHELESS I'M RESPECTFUL OF THE LOCAL. LEADERSHIP'S DESIRE TO MOVE IT AND WITH SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. SO WITHOUT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ALLOW SENATOR MANY CLOSE. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR YOUR SUPPORT I THANK YOU CHAIR MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS A LOCAL ELECTIONS BILL AND HAS NO FORMAL OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. PERFECT THANK YOU SENATOR MADAM I RECOGNIZE THE MOTION FROM SENATOR NEWMAN. THIS IS DUE PASS- THERE ARE KNOWN AND SO THOUGH THE AUTHORS AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS.
