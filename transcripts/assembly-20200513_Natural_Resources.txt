THESE IMPACTS TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY ECONOMIC CONTINUITY ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY AND PROVISION OF BASIC SERVICES MANY IMPACTS WILL VERY BASED ON ACOMMUNITIES PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS WHICH TEND TO EXTEND BEYOND CITY OR COUNTY BOUNDARIES. THIS MAKES REGIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFITS AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES A VITAL COMPONENT OF THROW RESILIENCY PLANNING SOME LOCAL ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF BEGUN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HOWEVER MANY ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEGUN COORDINATING THIS PREPARED AS WITH THE CHASE AND ENTITIES IN THE REGION. AND SOME HAVE NOT BEGUN PLANNING OUT ALL DUE TO THE LACK OF COORDINATED PLANNING THE STATE'S CURRENT MECHANISM FOR FUNDING ADAPTATION PROJECTS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY PIECEMEAL WITH NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATING ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE RESILIENCY RETURN AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE SIX TO FILL THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING GUIDANCE.

YEAH THE MOST SCALE FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION WORK IS REGIONAL. REGIONAL LEVEL. SO ARE ABLE TO SPEND. BOUNDARIES AS THEY DO WHILE ALSO RESPONDING TO REGIONAL CLIMATE RISKS AS THEY ALSO MUST TO. GET THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CHALLENGE NOW FACING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL GREATLY THREATEN THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT THIS ESSENTIAL PLANNING. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE WILL CREATED DURABLE FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE ADAPTATION PLANNING AND ACTION IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT NECESSARY FUTURE FUNDING CAN BE ALLOCATED IN A MANNER TO SUPPORT SUCH A COLLABORATION. AND RESPECTED I FIRST NATURES ARE REGION'S. SPECIFICALLY WE BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY ONE FRAMEWORK HELPS TO SUPPORT THREE LEGS OF THE STOOL NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL REGIONAL ADAPTATION WORK FIRST.

MS EGGMAN. THANK YOU OF GOOD MORNING MISTER MULLIS NICE TO SEE YOU I JUST HAVE A QUESTION THAT. THAT AS WE ALL CLEANED UP ALL OF OUR BILL PACKAGES AND ARE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET. I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF BUT SEALEVEL RISE AND IN THE FUTURE COSTS OF THAT BUT SHOULD WE REALLY BE TAKING ANYTHING OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW. IN LIGHT OF A- SHOULDWE REALLY BE TAKING ANYTHING ON THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW IN LIGHT OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT. WELL THE SEVENTY ONE THAT'S A- THAT'S A BROADER QUESTION THAT GOES BEYOND THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL- OF PERHAPS A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE IT MAY BE A VERY PRACTICAL AND ONE THAT WE FACE. BOB THIS AUGUST IN PARTICULAR- WITH OUR TRAILER BILL PROCESS I THINK WE ARE ALL POLICING FOR THAT REAR. WE ARE ACTIVELY CONTEMPLATING A RESILIENCY- PACKAGE THE RESILIENCY BOND. THAT WOULD BE A JOB CREATING ONE THAT'S THE TOPIC OF A IFFERENT CONVERSATION BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. I THINK WE NEED TO- DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WHETHER IT'S- THIS CYCLE OR A FUTURE CYCLE THERE WILL BE FUNDING STREAMS FOR. OF THE GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME IN CLIMATE. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESSES IN PLACE. SO WHEN THOSE FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE- WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO PRIORITIZE A REGIONAL PLANNING TO PRIORITIZE PROJECT- THEY GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE TAXPAYER BUCK- IN TERMS OF ANY KIND OF FUTURE BOND FINANCING OR OTHER FUNDING MECHANISM SO REALLY THIS IS ABOUT. INCENTIVIZING THE RIGHT KIND OF REGIONAL PLANNING BUT- I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS IT'S ONE THAT I SHARE THAT WE LIVE IN A DRAMATICALLY ALTERED. REALITY IN THIS BUILDING- SOMETHING THAT I COULD NOT HAVE CONTEMPLATED WHEN I SHE DID THIS BILL WILL. BUT KEEP IN THE MAG OF THAT. CAN THAT CONFRONTS THIS STATE. WE HAVE KEEP BILLS TURN IT TO INCENTIVIZE KIND OF PLANNING IF AND WHEN IT LET'S HOPE IT'S WHEN FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE TO MAKE RESILIENCY PROJECTS UP A REALITY. THANK YOU.

I WILL JUST SAY BEFORE I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND CORRECT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE A DOCTOR EGGMAN SO- QUESTION ABOUT THE BUDGET. I DO THINK- WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT WITH ALL OF OUR BILLS THIS YEAR AND SOMETHING THAT THE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR WILL ALSO HELP US WITHIN THE APPROPRIATIONS. CHAIRS WILL HELP US WITH BUT THIS PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN US THAT. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACES FOR US TO PUT OUR MONEY IS IN PLANNING AND RESILIENCY AND BEING PREPARED AND WE DO KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A LOOMING. DISASTER THAT'S GOING TO DO IF- THIS PANDEMIC AND SO THE MORE WE DO TO MITIGATE THAT NOW. I THINK. CERTAINLY MONEY WELL SPENT SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WITH THAT CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL.

ONE MEDIC CHAIR COLLEAGUES I CATCH MY BREATH WA RUNNING DOWN THE HALL THE PROBLEM I'VE GOT MY MASK HAD RUN BACK. BUT IT- GOOD MORNING IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE FIRST ONE I THINK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THE WORK ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH STAFF- IN THAT AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS. IN COMMITTEE AND- I PRESENTED A FEW BILLS. NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED OUT QUICKLY THIS HEALTH CRISIS WILL TRANSFORM OUR LIVES AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY MOVING FORWARD- WE CERTAINLY OR WE CAN BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN. THAT ARE PRE PANDEMIC PROBLEMS OF HOUSING. OF HOMELESSNESS. OF ADDRESSING OUR CLIMATE CRISIS THESE PROBLEMS STILL EXIST AND CERTAINLY WILL ONLY GET WORSE AS WE SHIFT OUR FOCUS TO ADDRESS OUR CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS AND DON'T GET ME WRONG. ADDRESS IT IS HEALTH CRISIS IS A SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT EXISTING PROBLEMS FROM GETTING WORSE SO WITH THAT SAID MADAM CHAIR. I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE AND PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO NINE FIVE FOUR. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. A. B. THIRTY TWO THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ALL FROM ALL SOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THAT THE CAL THAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THAT WE DEVELOP A SCOPING PLAN A PLAN- THAT THE DESCRIBES OUR APPROACH- THAT WOULD BEAT THE APPROACH OUR STATE WILL TAKE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SCOPING PLAN MUST BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS. AND THE PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT PLAN UP I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE THIS BEER THIS BILL HERE TODAY. IT'S A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEXT PLAN UPDATE FULLY CONSIDER AND LEVERAGE. THE HUGE POWER OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IN ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS. AS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NATURAL IN WORKING LANCE COMPRISE OVER 90% 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AND BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE. THIS INCLUDES FORESTS RANGELANDS FARMS URBAN GREEN SPACES A WETLAND SOILS. AND THESE LANDS HAVE POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CARBON. AB TWO NINE FIVE FOUR IS A SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IMPORTANT BILL. IT WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORKING COLLABORATION WITH OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. AND IDENTIFIED OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WORKING LANCE ACCORDING TO THE BILL LANGUAGE. THIS OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL WILL IDENTIFY ACTIONS TO SEQUESTER CARBON AND REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IDENTIFY PRACTICES POLICY INCENTIVES AND POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN BARRIERS. THAT WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THIS KIND OF GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA NATURAL LOOKING LANDS. WHY IS THIS BILL IMPORTANT. AS A STATE WE MUST REMAIN STEADFAST IN OUR COMMITMENT AND EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OF CARBON. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE DEVELOP PATHWAYS TO REMOVE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE MET RESEARCHERS FROM THROUGH OUT THE WORLD AGREE. IF WE'RE GOING TO FEND OFF THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE MUST MAXIMIZE METHODS TO SEQUESTER OR CAPTURE CARD. CLEARLY THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THERE'S NO SINGLE TECHNOLOGY OR METHOD. TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE CO TWO TO REMOVE ALL THAT IS REQUIRED. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS ONE. THERE ARE NATURAL WAYS TO CAPTURE AND SUPPRESSED A CARBON. AND TWO THERE ARE WAYS TO CAPTURE CARD INVOLVE COMPLEX ENGINEERING. AND QUITE HONESTLY. REQUIRE A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH. WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS LOGISTICAL AND REGULATORY HURDLES ALL OF WHICH- ARE POSSIBLE. BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME IT'S GONNA TAKE MONEY. AND THE SECOND POINT UNDERSCORES OUR NEED TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. IN ARCATA CLIMATE CONVERSATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NATURAL SOLUTIONS FOR SEQUESTERING OR CAPTURING CARBON ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE. CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH LITTLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARE AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW. THESE NATURAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDE LAND MANAGEMENT RESTORATION OF WOODLANDS AND WETLANDS. AND OTHER PRACTICES THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON STARTED TREASON SOILS. AS DETAILED THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ARE NATURAL WORKING LANDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL. TO CONTRIBUTE UP GAS REDUCTION GOAL. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING- ADDITIONAL. SOME POSITIVES OR SOME BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER QUALITY AIR QUALITY FOOD PRODUCTION LAND CONSERVATION AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AGAIN PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE FOR OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA NATURAL WORKING LANDS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WOULD IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES POLICY INCENTIVES AND POTENTIAL REDUCTION THE BARRIERS THAT WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. IN THIS WAY. THE BILL WILL BE SURE THAT NATURAL WORKING THAT'S ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATES CLIMATE PLAN THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON AVAILABLE DATA AND RESEARCH. A BY VANCE IN NATURAL WAYS- THAT TO HELP CALIFORNIA CHEAP EMISSION REDUCTIONS NOT TO MAGIC CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECOSYSTEMS OVERALL HEALTH- THE VALUE OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS TO CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT TO OUR ECONOMY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES CANNOT BE OVERSTATED MANAGER. AND WITH ME- HERE AT THIS HEARING TO FURTHER INTRODUCED EXPLAIN THIS BILL IS MICHELLE THE SORROW WITH THE- NATURE CONSERVANCY. AND GINNY MERYL WITH THE CALFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU- MADAME MODERATOR CAN BE PLEASE HAVE THE WITNESSES. LINES ARE OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE PATH THROW AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CLIMATE PROGRAM AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. HEY THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AT THE PORT OF IMPORTANT BILL AND AS A SPONSOR WE ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED NATURE TO SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OUR CLIMATE. SENATE BILL WOULD ADVANCE. AS WELL AS OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFIT. THEIR NUMBER PUBLISHED SCIENTIFI ANALYSIS INCLUDING SEVERAL THAT WE HAVE DONE WHICH INDICATE THAT ACTED LIKE URBAN FORESTRY FOURTH RESTORATION FIRE RISK REDUCTION LAND CONSERVATION. AND A VARIETY OF LAND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TERM LONG TERM CLINICAL. TO REDUCE CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE ALSO PROTECT UNITIES FROM CLIMATE IMPACT LIKE FIRE EXTREME HEAT. SEALEVEL RISE IN FLOOD. OVER THE PAST DECADE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT WORK IN THE STATE ON THE TOPIC AT THE MEETING GREENHOUSE GAS PRODUCTION POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING METHODS AND IDENTIFYING THE RANGE OF BENEFITS THAT COULD RESULT FROM CLIMATE ACTION IN THE SECTOR. THE OF THE POOR A CLEAR CLIMB. AND COORDINATED THE STATE ACTION LIKE WE HAVE ANOTHER FACTORS ARE STILL MISSING. THE BILL REPORTER CATALYST TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY LEADERSHIP LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. IN ADVANCE AGENCY COORDINATION WITH A CLEAR LEAD. PROVIDES A CLEAR TIMELINE FOR CLINICAL AND PLAN ON AND OFF THAT KNOWLEDGE IS THAT CLIMATE STRATEGY FOR OUR NATIONAL WORKING LAND IN CALIFORNIA AND NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER IMPORTANT BENEFIT. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FILL ENERGY- I BUT- THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU KAREN NUMBER OF MY NAME'S JEANNIE MERYL AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK THE COALITION OF FORMER LEADERS AND THE PEOPLE OUR CULTURE GROUPS WORKING TO ADVANCE OUR CULTURAL POLLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR IT'S RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO FINALLY ADVANCE TO CLIMATE FULL AN RELATED STRATEGIES FOR BASTIN IMPORTANT NATURAL WORKING LAND. I WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN AGRICULTURE- FIRST THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH FOR ALL FARMS EXPECTED ARE LAID OUT IN AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR. WE DO HAVE MODELING FROM THE STATE AND OTHER RESEARCHERS. ARE THAT IT'S BEEN ABLE COULD QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION FROM AGRICULTURE. BASED ON THE BIRTHDAY FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AND I THOUGHT **** THERE WILL BE NOT THEY'LL BE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VARIETY OF PATHS FORWARD TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND INCREASED CARBON THINK FONG FARM. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR DOES NOTHING TO TAKE AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND DIVERSITY OF APPROACH MANY PROGRAMS ARE CERTAINLY UP IN THE AIR AS THE STATE GRAPPLED WITH THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE COPA NINETEEN CRISIS. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS FUND TO SUPPORT CLAIM IT'S MORE LIKE A CULTURE PROGRAMS WE WILL CERTAINLY ADVOCATE THAT THANK YOU. BUT REGARDLESS OF SHORT TERM BUDGET DEFICIT AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR HAS A LONGER TERM VIEW OF WHAT IS NECESSARY TO HELP THE STATE ACHIEVED AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL OF NATURAL WORKING WITH TO HELP MEET OUR CLINICAL THIS CRITICAL TO THAT TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE W. TROUT EFFORT. AND SHOT SHOULD NOT I NEED FIRE IMMEDIATE CRISIS. FURTHERMORE NOTHING IN A TWENTY FIFTY FOR THE WHAT ARE THIS TO IMPOSE REGULAR. ON TO LIMIT OR CHANGE THE TYPE OF CROPS. GROWN IN THE STATE. OF THE BILL SIMPLY STATES THAT THERE RESOURCES FOR IDENTIFIER CLINICAL AND INCLUDE NATURAL WORKING LAND IN THE LATEST COPING PLANS DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE MORE FARMERS THAN EVER BEFORE SIGNING UP FOR THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM OF A LANDMARK PLANS FOR ACT. GRAHAM HE HAS REACHED. OVER A FOR HUNDRED TO SIXTY HEALTHY SOIL APPLICATION WAS FEBRUARY. AND THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED- AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SCALE UP THIS WORKING MEANINGFUL WAYS. AND FARMWORKERS DEMONSTRATING TODAY- EVEN DURING UNCERTAIN TIMES BUT THEY WANT THE STATE CLIMATE EFFORTS TO CONTINUE. THANK YOU.

HE INTENDS TO BE OFF OF THEM AND FOR THE VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION OF GLOBAL HEALTH. ABSOLUTELY AND INTO IN OUR HAVING YOUR CHILD CALL. ARE CONCERNED THAT WE IN OPPOSED. THAN FROM THE LARGER A OF HOW WE DEFINE MEASURE AND REACH THOSE GOALS. AND AS AN INITIAL DISCUSS. BUT CARBON. OVER WILL BE ON IT LIKE THAT. GOVERNOR CLINTON SAID IN A GOAL CARBON BY TWENTY CORD FIVE AND ADMINISTRATION WE GOT WORKS TO EVALUATE WHAT THAT CAN AND SHOULD MEET. THIS BILL WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAD SPOKEN ON THE BIG IMPORTANT ISSUE OF CARBON NEUTRALITY. AND WILL MEMORIALIZED IN THE BACK YOU DIRECTED THAT WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT FOR THE MARKET TO REACT. WITH FEAR THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE OF GOAL SETTING FOR THE AGRICULTURAL WORKING WENT FACTORED BEFORE AN ECONOMY LIKE WHITE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL IS EVALUATED AND FLUSHED OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE WILL SPEND BIG OPEN THE MARKET THE CALIFORNIA. THE FOCUS HEAVILY ON IT AGRICULTURAL WORKING WENT BACK A CARBON EMISSION NOTED BY THE IN ALPHABETICAL FIVE ONLY 9% OF GLOBAL. EMISSIONS RATHER THAN ENGAGING. ALL FACTORED. CARPET AND SEQUESTRATION. WE REALIZE. THAT WE INTEND TO BE ALL AND THEREFORE WE ARE TOO MUCH BUT YOU'RE- THAT CAUTION. IN ADVANCE THE INDUSTRY THE GOAL PRIOR TO THE CAR NEUTRAL DISCUSS. WHEN OUR MANY FAT. INDUSTRY AND IN THAT INTO THAT BUT CARD. IN WE CAN INSURE WIN THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY AT TO A GREAT. BIG GOAL I GOT TO MEET THEM LOOK AT HOW THE- WANTS THE THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY CALL THE BORDER. IN A MATTER OF NATURE THE APPROPRIATE AND I'M OPERATE FOR CALIFORNIA PROVIDERS. WELL ABOUT WAITING THAT IN. BOB ABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS DELIVER WITH THE FARM BUREAU AT WE WITH IN THE AFTER AND ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR BUT WE AGREED THAT OUR NATIONAL WORKING LAND MANY ACRES OF WHAT TERM PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE ARE THE SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT DISCUSSION BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE NEED TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE BILL DEVELOP THE PATHWAY OF CREATING A GOAL AND MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT GOAL- WITH ITEMS LEFT OUT I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IN THE LATEST DRAFT OF THE NATURAL MARKING LANDS A COMMENDATION PLAN WHICHWILL LIKELY BE THE BASIS FOR DEVELOPING SEQUESTRATION GOAL IT ONLY PROPOSES TO ACCOUNT FOR STATE FUNDED THE- PROJECT WELL THE IS A- INVESTMENT. THAT LEAVES OUT OF THE PROJECT ARE BEING DONE WITH FEDERAL. INCLUDING MILLION. ANY REDUCE THE A AND R. AN ANY VOLUNTARY PER WORK BE YOU CAN SO WE DON'T THAT SETTING AN IMPORTANT GOAL AT THIS AND TRACKING WITH MISSING DATA IS APPROPRIATE I WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR FARMERS AND RANCHERS BY NATURE ARE COST CONSCIENCE AND LIKE ANY-BUSINESS OWNER THERE IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IF THEY CAN GET A RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT FROM A CORPORATE PERSPECTIVE IF THE PRACTICE OF A FARMER RANCHER TO EIGHT. YEAR OLD OR IMPROVE THE LEAVE THEIR PRODUCT- IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THAT OUR MEMBERS WOULD HAVE DONE THAT ARE READY AND MAKE THAT INVESTMENT THIS MEANS SPUR LAND STEWARDS TO DO EVEN MORE THAN THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THEY NEED THEY NEED FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND WHILE THE STATE HAS PROVIDED FUNDS THEY'VE DONE SO INCONSISTENTLY AND LOOKING AT THAT POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET DEFICIT WITH TWO YEAR AND THREE YEAR PROJECTED IMPACT CONSISTENT AND ADEQUATE FUNDING WILL LIKELY BE NOTHING IN SHORT WE ARE CONCERNED THE STATE'S BUDGET. WON'T MATCH. TEN FOR WORK OR NOT. TOWARD THE WELLINGTON. WILL CREATE WONDERS AND LOSERS. SOME COMMODITIES OR TYPE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS NATURALLY HAVE A GREATER CAPACITY TO SUPPORT YOUR CARBON THAN OTHERS- AN ORCHARD CROP WITH DEEPER ROOT OVER IT I TEND MAY DRAW DOWN MORE CARBON THAN AN ANNUAL CROP. SO GIVEN THAT SOME FARMS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR INCENTIVE TO WHERE THE OTHERS ARE NOT. AND MORE SIGNIFICANTLY SHOULD A FARMER MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT TO PLANT BASED ON WHAT DROPPED ON THE MOST CARBON. RATHER THAN WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR LAND OR WHAT THE MARKET DICTATES. WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE CONSOLIDATION OF FARMS WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE PRESSURE ON THE SMALL FARMS THAT ARE MAKING A SPECIALTY ITEMS. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME OFF THE DIVERSITY THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. NOBLE AND ADAPTIVE IN THESE THESE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. SO BASED ON THAT WE ASK YOU TO CONSIDER CONCERNS AND TO RESPECT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. THE THANK VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY. IN THE COMMITTEE WERE WISHING TO VOICE ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. OKAY THEN LET'S OPEN THE LINES FOR OPPOSITION AGAIN PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF ADD BY HITTING SIX AND TALK BY HITTING. SIX STAR SIX. AND ARE JUST YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM PLEASE.

AND I AM A- HUGE HUGE BELIEVER IN HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THE REALLY FINE CARBON SEQUESTRATION PROGRAMS ARE GOING ON ESPECIALLY ON THE- ON THE COAST- I'M NOT CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY JUST BECAUSE OF THE- I SHARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS FROM THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY. OF JUST YOU KNOW I MEAN THE AGAIN LIKE MISTER MULLINS BILL I'M TAKING EVERYTHING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORLD THAT WE'RE LIVING IN RIGHT NOW NOT JUST THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IDEAS- THAT WE ALL NEED TO DO BUT ALSO WHAT. HOW HOW WE'RE GONNA LOOK COMING THROUGH THIS AND SO I KNOW THAT IN GENERAL THE FOOD PRODUCTION. ARE DONE HOLE CONNIE IS BILL IS VERY UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES OUT THERE. THIS ONE MORE GOOD IDEA BUT WITHOUT ANY FUNDING AND WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THINGS WHEN THEY ARE BEING AND THEN MAKING NEW DECISIONS WHEN THERE'S ALREADY I THINK A LOT OF CONCERN. ABOUT THE CURRENT- TRANSPARENCY OF THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA LAST. BUT TO ADD ONE MORE SO WELL I APPRECIATE THE IDEA AND I- BUT SMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS OKAY THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT WITH ME. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES AT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO AGREE THAT WORKING LINE TO SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE TAKING ADVANTAGE AND WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT. BEING IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN WITH. WITH THE WORKING LAST SEASON MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT AND- IN LIEU OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THAT NEEDS TO BE OUR PRIORITY- AND WHEN WE WIN THAT FIGHTENOUGH I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT. AT EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THE TICKET ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR DID THIS AND MAKE THAT CLEAR AND- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME IN YOUR BILL THAT WE HAVE THOSE FROM ADDRESS ALSO. YES WITH WITH YOUR SENTIMENT IN YOUR INTENT AROUND THAT AROUND THAT WELL I THINK THE INTENT OF THE BILL OBVIOUSLY IS TO CAPITALIZE ON A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ISN'T NEW- AND- ALSO SEND I THINK THE- THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS DID A GOOD JOB TO IDENTIFY A LOT OF THE- DID THESE PEACE. PROGRAM AROUND ACTUAL WORK AND- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE CONCERNS I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION AND- BUT NO THIS CERTAINLY THIS CRISIS IS IN A WAY FOR GOVERNOR ACT- THE OTHER IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN. A PRIORITY AND IS THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE A SOMETHING THAT AS THE ANALYSIS YOU ALLUDED TO. THE CARD IS ALREADY TAKING TO MAKE THIS OF ALL THE NEXT COPING PLANET THE LEGISLATION IS A PRIORITIZE AT WORK. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE END TO THIS AWESOME VERY BROAD IN SCOPE IN AND FOCUS. THE WORKING. YEAH THE CAR. QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO REVERSE WHAT THE DATA TELL US THEY NOW TO WORKING LAN ALL RIGHT NOW. G. D. G. SO. AND THAT'S EXACTLY. AND CAN DO BETTER ME. YOU KNOW THE FOR THAT 9% OF THIS STATE YOU KNOW THE THAT ALLOW. YEAH HE- HERE CALIFORNIA INVOLVES THESE NATIONAL WORKING LANDS. YOU KNOW I THINK THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW- WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS TOPIC ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IS CERTAINLY WHAT'S GOING TO WORK IN ONE PART OF THE STATE IS GOING TO WORK IN OTHER PARTS TO SAY WHAT'S GOING TO WORK ON YOU KNOW. THESE PATHWAYS METHODS ARE GOING TO WORK ON THE ONE SIDE OF THE PLANET ARE GONNA WORK ON THE OTHER SIDE. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE. SO THERE'S A LOT MORE RESEARCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE WE KNOW THAT. THIS THIS EFFORT. TO GO SO FAR AS OUR DOCTORS ORG AND- I'LL- WITH. THE LATE TIME TO THE IT. PORN BUT YOU KNOW I'D BE HAPPY. WITH YOU. THE ONE. YEAH ANY OF CONCERNS. I MEAN I I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF A OF YOUR BILL TO DATE I JUST IN. REALLY HAS A TEN AS WE TALK ABOUT PART CAPTURE IT AN EASY WAY OF OPENING THE DOOR STUFF THAT ONLY I MISSION REDUCTIONS BECOME SECONDARY WHEN I SHOULD BE PRIMARY INCITEMENT AS WE'RE DOING THIS WORK AS THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOVE AND BE DONE WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ORACLE- A. R. B. SEVENTY PLANNING TO DO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT THE MODELS GUARDRAILS AND THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF FOR EMISSION REDUCTIONS- BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE COMMISSION REDUCTIONS ON TO HELP US WITH CARBON TO HELP US WITH OTHER A PARTICULAR MATTER THAT ARE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL AND COMMUNITIES. LIKE MINE NO I. AT THIS DISCUSSION CAN. THAT WOULD JUST BE REMISS IF I DID AND HIGHLIGHT THAT CONCERN AND THAT NEED TO.

AND WHAT IS WHAT IN THE ALL OF THE- QUESTION. ONLY. FIVE TWENTY NINE NINE THE SOURCE ORGANIC ANIMAL FOR FROM THEIR OP. THAT IS PATENTLY NOT TRUE TWENTY NINE FACT I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT YOU- ARE REFER TO PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. TWENTY FIVE FIFTY NINE IS NOT DESIGNED NOR DOES THE MEASURE LIMITED ANYWAY. AND AGRICULTURAL SOURCE FROM SELLING OR GIVING AWAY ITS AGRICULTURAL WASTE PRODUCT TO ANOTHER ENTITY FOR ANOTHER USE AND THEREFORE NO HARM IS CAUSED. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY NINE WILL ELIMINATE THE CONFUSION REGARDING HOW TO THIRTY THIRTY SIX IS INTERPRETED. AND WILL PROTECT LOCAL FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN HOLLERS AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR WE WANT TO THANK MR MCCARTY FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE URGE YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU THANK YOU CLEARLY THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR MICROPHONE SO IF YOU WANTED TO RESTATE ANY OF THAT TESTING FOR THE MICROPHONE SWITCHED ON THAT'S- THAT'S- PERMISSIBLE THE- LADY. WE ALL HEARD IT I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF IT WAS HEARD BY THE PUBLIC OKAY NEXT WITNESS PLEASE- OF NOT A MODERATOR IF YOU CAN QUEUE UP THE NEXT WITNESS. YOUR OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD I'M SORRY THE WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON IN THE ROOM. YES GOOD MORNING SHARE MEMBERS NIGHTCLUB OPERATOR WASTE. NINE YOUR FRIEND A LITTLE BIT CRISIS THE THERE WAS A LOT OF OFFICES THEY'LL PROBABLY FEDERAL BILL BECAUSE THAT THAT LEGISLATION OUT PASSED TWO YEARS AGO EITHER IN THIRTY THING. WHICH AT THE TIME WAS INTENDED I'M SORRY WHAT A MINUTE IS HIS MICROPHONE ON THIS TIME. LET'S JUST MAKE SURE. DONE OKAY TIME NOW THANK YOU YOU CAN CREATE A SORRY NECROPOLIS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE HERE IN SUPPORT. AB THIRTY THIRTY SIX WHICH PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO WAS A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED BILL THAT CODIFIED SOMETHING THAT EXISTING PRACTICE FOR DECADES- NAMELY- FOOD PROCESSORS SENDING THEIR BY PRODUCTS TO ANIMAL FEED IT'S A GREAT THING WE LOVE IT- IT'S A GREAT FOR RECYCLING AND TRADITIONALLY AYE MATERIAL. BEEN PART OF THE SOLID WASTE STREAM. INTO AB THIRTY THIRTY SIX JUST CALL BY THAT AND SAID THAT IF YOU ARE- DISCARDING OF THESE MATERIALS FROM THE SOURCES. THEN YOU CAN SEND THEM TO A THE- A- ANIMAL THE OPERATION WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S COVERED IN A FRANCHISE IT WAS DONE BECAUSE OF A SPECIFIC FOOD PROCESSOR IN AUTHORS DISTRICT AND- ULTIMATELY. WAS VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED SINCE THEN IT'S BEEN REINTERPRETED- BEYOND WHAT I THINK ANYBODY HAD IMAGINED TO MEAN THAT ANYBODY WHO GENERATES ANY KIND OF FOOD IS SUDDENLY NO LONGER PART OF THE US ALWAYS FRANCHISE IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO THE LOCAL CONTROL OF JURISDICTIONS. WHICH IS- I MEAN FRANKLY. SOMEWHAT PREPOSTEROUS SINCE THE REASON WE HAVE ALWAYS FRANCHISES IS TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS. OF FOOD WASTE AND OTHER P. TRESSEL MATERIALS THE FRANCHISE SYSTEMS ALSO THE BEDROCK OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IN THE RECYCLING AND WASTE WORLD. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR CURRENT RECYCLING SYSTEM WHATSOEVER IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO ISSUE LONG TERM FRANCHISES FOR THAT MATERIAL SIMILARLY AS WE ROLL OUT COMPOSTING PROGRAMS AND ORGANICS PROGRAMS THOSE CANNOT WORK IF THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK. AND BEYOND RECYCLING- THE LOCAL FRANCHISES HAVE BEEN USED TO ADVANCE CLEAN AIR REQUIREMENTS FOR FLEETS LABOR REQUIREMENTS A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL- THIS REALLY SHOULD NOT BE A CONTROVERSIAL BILL. SINCE THE INTERPRETATION BEING OFFERED BY THE OPPOSITION IS WAY BEYOND WHAT WAS INTENDED ORIGINALLY.

A GOOD MORNING AGAIN- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TAYLOR OCEAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE FUNDS ARE NOT THERE TO HERE ARE CONCERNED WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY NINE I CALCULATE THAT PRODUCERS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF USING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BY PRODUCTS TRANSPORTED BY NON FRANCHISED POLLARD FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES FOR ANIMAL FEED- THESE ARE THINGS LIKE FOR INVEST BRINES AND GREAT PROMISE NOT HOLD. PRODUCT FROM NOT PRODUCTION PLANT AND BAKERY WASTE ENSURING THAT THE BY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE AT SEAT FOR LIVESTOCK HAS HAD MULTIPLE BANDAGES IT PROVIDES VALUABLE NATURE DURING ALSO SPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN FEED PRICES HAVE VARIED DRAMATICALLY IT KEEPS- THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS OUT OF LANDFILLS AND AVOID THE NEED TO EITHER GROW FEET AND- YOU CAN. RESOURCES IMPORT FEED OFF FOR HELP I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR LIFE SECOND PRODUCERS AND ALLOWANCES FOR THE DIVERSION- PROVIDE US WITH. THE ABILITY TO. GEN RECYCLERS WRECKING THESE BENEFITS EXISTING LAW WITH. CRAP TO NAY DRAWN THE CONDITION. THE BY PRODUCT MONTH ME IN ORDER TO BE. OUTSIDE DIFFERENT AT THE REMAINS BUT WE WERE PURPOSEFUL AND ALLOWING THEM TO BE FROM A LARGE UNIVERSE OF COLLECTION SITE. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY NINE HOWEVER. IN THE CHIP AWAY AT THAT LIST OF ELIGIBLE COLLECTION SITE EVEN THOSE THAT THAT MEET THE NARROW CONDITIONS IN THE LAW- MIDDLE TO REQUIRED THOSE BY PRODUCT GENERATORS TO BEEN WORKING WITH DOLLARS FOR DECADES NOW DO SO UNDER FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. WELL THE SPONSORED CONTENT MAYBE TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND FORTY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE RESULT IN MORE QUETIONS- THE BILL PROPOSES TO AT. THE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF BY PRODUCT THAT CAN BE SOURCE FROM OTHER RETAIL FOOD FACILITIES AT FOR OPERATIONS ARE BOTH PROCESSING PRODUCTS AND OFFERING FOOD ON SITE LATE COMMERCIAL BAKERY. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT UNCLEAR IF THEY MAKE THE PER PRODUCT OUTSIDE OF FRENCH AND HAULING AGREEMENTS. THESE QUESTIONS OF THE PARK ABILITY WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY MANY FACILITIES AND WHAT CONCERNED THAT EITHER. OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF. DO Q. INCONSISTENT INTERPRETATION OR BECAUSE OF INCREASED BIRD AND DIVERTING THESE PRODUCTS FOR ANIMAL FEED WILL NO LONGER BE A PRIORITY FOR THE PARTY. AT THE BY PRODUCT. THE TYPE OF AND WE'LL PRODUCERS ACCESS TO IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF ANIMAL FEED. NINE WHEN. THE MY KEVIN CASTRO CAL AFTER. ARE RAN AND GERRY HAVE LOST MARKET OVERNIGHT. AND THE TO TRY. THAT MAY OCCUR FOR THIS BILL WILL EXAGGERATE THOSE PAINS FOR THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSED FANTASY NINE AND RESPECT OR QUESTION ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN OUR NEXT WITNESS IS HERE IN PERSON YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU. I'LL BE ON THE ON THE UP CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED BUT ONE MOMENT LET'S MAKE SURE YOUR MICROPHONE IS ON LOOK AT. IT'S ON OKAY DENNIS I'LL BE ON A ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED PACIFIC EGG AND POULTRY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS. SO THE GHOST RUNNER DISSOCIATION AND THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE. HI THIS MEASURES IS ABOUT ORGANIC RECYCLING. WHEN FORMER CHAIRPERSON CHILLS BOROUGH PASSED HIS MEASURE AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX. THEY HAVE A GOAL 75% ORGANICS DIVERSION. REQUIRED ORGANICS TO BE MANAGED LOCALLY. ONE OF THE MAIN DISCUSSIONS IN THIS ROOM IN THIS COMMITTEE WAS HOW DO WE PROMOTE COLLECTING ORGANICS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TRADITIONALLY RECYCLED. WILL NOT IMPACTING TRADITIONAL SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN RECYCLING ORGANIC FOR DECADES. SUCH AS HOLLYWOODLIFE FEED AND ECONOMIC LAND APPLICATION SO THAT WAS THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS HAD. ON THAT BILL WHICH IS THE VERY. NEXT BOOK REQUIRE. THIRTY SIX WAS A REAR TO HOLD FOR LIFE FEED BEING PUT OUT OF THEIR CON. THEY HAD FOR DECADES BY THESE NEWLY CREATED MONOPOLISTIC FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS THERE WERE ENCOURAGED BY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. ACCORDING TO THE US EPA HIERARCHY OF FOOD WASTE FEEDING LIVESTOCK IS A HIGHER AND BETTER USE THAN HOW THESE MATERIALS WE CAN HANDLE TO THE FRANCHISE HOLLERS. IN ADDITION THE LIVESTOCK FEED DOLLARS HAVE COMPETITIVE CONTRACTS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR THE GENERATOR AND GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS MATERIAL HAS BEEN RECYCLED FOR DECADES THE COMPETITIVE CONTRACTS THERE WERE NEVER SUBJECT TO THESE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THIS MATERIAL REPLACES. VIRGIN FEED MATERIAL SUCH AS GRAY AND ALFALFA. 41% OF A GEHRY RATIONS PULL TO RATION OUR FOOD BY PRODUCTS IF THIS MATERIALS NOT MADE AVAILABLE THE MOST BY PRODUCTS MUST BE REPLACED WITH GRAIN IMPORTER FOR THE MIDWEST ALFALFA GROWN ON MORE LAND WATER FERTILIZER INPUTS HERE IN THE STATE. THAT'S DISCUSS THE ANALYSIS SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHICH IS THE FALL A BILL. TO MISTER JUST ROSE BILL. RECENT REQUIRE RECYCLING TO DIVERT 75% OF THE RIVER ANNEXED NOT ALREADY RECYCLE. AND THAT'S THE KEY THE ORGANIC JUST LIKE THERE WAS A CURRENT ALL OVER THE STATE- PRIOR TO EIGHT TO TWENTY SIX. CALPERS REPORT ON THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE- RESULTING COSTS TO TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS OF AT LEAST TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER EMPLOYMENT THE 75% DIVERSION RIGHT. SO THE ORGANIC MATERIAL SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN GOING TO FEET. THAT IS IN OUR CYCLE FOR DECADES IF IT IF THIS IS PASSED EVERY TIME THAT IS THEN TAKEN THROUGH A FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WILL ADD TO THAT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR COST TO REPAIR THE TAXPAYERS. AND FLOOD BUT THE EXISTING ALREADY TAXED. INFRASTRUCTURE IF WE USE THIS STUFF OUTSIDE TOWARDS LIVESTOCK FEED WE AVOID- THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS. OUR CONTRACTS ARE COMPETITIVE IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN YEAH SURE THING THE WASTE HAULERS CAN DO AND BET ON THEM AS WELL AND MANY OF THEM DO BID ON THESE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER THEY WANT TO PUSH OUT THE COMPETITION THROUGH LEGISLATION RATHER THAN THE MARKET PLACE. AND FINALLY THE CARPORT IS THIS IS NOT AN URGENCY THERE ISN'T COVE RELATIONSHIP HERE AND SO WE WELCOME THE CONVERSATIONAL HELP GOING TO BE THOSE ARE CHARACTERS LIKE THAT WE HAVE MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE OF FULL DE INCREASED ORGANICS- RECYCLING. HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD OCCUR IN A MUCH LARGER COMPETITION HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TACKLE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD ASK THE MODERATOR TO PLEASE ON THE LINE FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IF YOU WISH TO OPPOSE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HAVE ONE THAT CUED UP AND WE'LL GET IN JUST A MOMENT. NINE ONE TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CHAIR NUMBERED REBEKAH BACK AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AND BOB THERE'S A LINE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. FOR THE COMMENTS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER CALLERS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER CALLERS. NO OTHER CALLERS AT THIS TIME PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WILL LIGHT ON MY OPPOSITION SINCE MISTER CALDERON IS IN HERE- I RESPECT FOR MY COLLEAGUE WHO I'M SURE IS IN THIS FIRST IS MISTER CALDERON WOULD BE ON THIS BILL- EASY. I LOVE YOU TOO MAN EIGHT I THINK THAT ON A I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. BUT IT IS VERY POORLY TIMED OX SPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT MARKETS WITHIN AGRICULTURE- WE'RE GOING INTO THE DISCUSSIONS OF MEAT RATIONING AND OTHER THINGS RIGHT NOW I THINK ANY- ADDED REGULATIONS-% PUT ON THE INDUSTRY. DEALING GETTING INTO FEET STOCKING AND ANY OF THESE THINGS WE- AS MENTIONED IN THE TESTIMONY THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF ORGANIC RECYCLING ALREADY HAPPENING- IN FOLKS THIS ISN'T JUST A CALIFORNIA THING THIS IS NATIONWIDE I AM ON A WEEKLY CONFERENCE CALLS. ARMED WITH. DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL GROUPS DEALING WITH WHAT IS GOING ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA THAT THIRTEEN IT'S NATIONALLY IT'S INTERNATIONALLY WE'RE DEALING WITH A POSSIBLE FOOD SHORTAGE HERE AND PUTTING ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF. FOOD PRODUCTION AND CAUSING ANY ADDED INCREASED AT THIS TIME ISN'T GOING TO HELP- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ALREADY BEFORE THIS HAD ONE IN FIVE KIDS GOING HUNGRY EVERY NIGHT IN OUR FOOD BANKS ARE DEALING WITH SHORTAGES AS WELL- MEMBERS I ASK YOU TO EITHER VOTE NO OR OF STAND ON THIS SO WE CAN KEEP FOOD PRODUCTION AT THE FOREFRONT- INNKEEPER PEOPLE FED. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME A PANDEMIC THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS DR EGGMAN. THANK YOU AND. I ALSO WON'T QUESTION ME TOO DEEPLY MISS MCCARTY ALTHOUGH I'M SURE YOU ARE VERY WELL VERSED BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THE ISSUE THAT CAUSES THE BIGGEST- HARPER AND IS LIKE THE OTHER RETAIL FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS RIGHT SO THERE'S LIKE BROUGH POPS OUT WINERIES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT HAVE A LOT OF WASTED THAT GOES FOR FEED STOCK RIGHT NOW. SO WHY NOT MAKE THAT EXPLICIT IN HERE SO THERE'S I THINK THERE'S ROOM TO WORK IN A LOOK FORTY MAYBE SUPPORTING THIS LATER BUT INTELLIGENCE TIGHTENED UP SO THIS MISTER AT MATHIS POINTED OUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE FEEDSTOCK WITH I MEAN. EVEN IF IT'S COMPOST. THIS IS LAND FILL. GOING TO FEED- STOCK RIGHT NOW THAT IS CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY PEOPLE ANIMALS COMPOST- SO INTO SOME OF THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED. I WILL BE ABLE SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISHING TO MAKE A COMMENT. SURE. WE ARE LIVE IN AND- BECAUSE THAT THAT THE TIME SAID THAT DEALING WITH THE CALL OF IT IT STARTS FROM LONG TERM REALITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO ANY OF OUR OTHER WORK- AND THAT WE WOULD FIND A WAY TO MULTI TASK- WERE WORTH UP APPROPRIATE I WAS HERE WHEN WE DID THE COOLEY BILL- AND WAS. AROUND WHEN WHAT THE INTENT WAS IN THE DEAL LESS THAN- I DO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME CLARIFICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS BILL AND I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A SPACE FOR THE OPPOSITION AND THE OTHER TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON WHAT THAT FACE MIGHT BE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE HONORING A DEAL THAT WAS MADE BEFORE INSTALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL A I JUST ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO WORK AT THE TABLE ON THE SAME WAY YOU WORK COLLABORATIVELY NEEDED THE COOLEY BILL A FEW YEARS BACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE CA MEMBERS. MR MCCARTY FEEL LIKE TO RESPOND YEAH THAT THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT IN THE WEEDS AS MUCH AS SOMEONE MEMBER CALDERON IS ON THIS BUT JUST FROM THE BIG PICTURE AND HAVING SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR IT AT THE NUMBER OF YEARS. JUST LIKE AND I RESPECT WHAT MISTER MATHIS TALKED ABOUT THAT THE FRAGILE ECONOMICS OF THE OF THE AG INDUSTRY THE SAME THING WITH THE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY IN THESE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND TEARING TO MAKE IN PENCIL OUT OR NOT BEEN SOUGHT SPECIALLY CUTE WHO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. NO THAT AND THESE PIECES ARE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO CANCEL OUT BUT ALSO FOR US TO ACHIEVE OUR DIVERSION- POLICIES WHICH WE'VE BEEN. WORKING REALLY HARD TO ACHIEVE- LAST TEN YEARS AFTER THE- CHEST FOR A BILL SO- WITH THAT- BACK CERTAINLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M CERTAIN THAT MISTER CALDERON WILL TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR SUGGESTION SOMEONE MEMBER EGGMAN AND TRY TO FIND. A BETTER BALANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I WILL SAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE I'M AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND WE BELIEVE THAT- WE APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT CHANGE. OF THE- HANDLING FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SOURCES LIKE FOOD PRODUCTION- I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE- COMMON GROUND. BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORTERS. THEN THEY SEEM TO THINK THERE IS AND I HOPE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO WORK- ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES TO THE SENATE. TO THE OPPOSITION CAN BE REMOVED. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THIS BILL THE SECOND. WITH A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. YOUR MOTION AND A SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS. FRIEDMAN HI ALL RIGHT FRIEDMAN I FLORA. FLORA NO CHAO. JOE HI EGGMAN HOW VOTING EGGMAN NOT VOTING GARCIA GARCIA HI. RAMON MATHIS THE OFFICE NO MCCARTY PARTY HI. BRO ROAD NOT VOTING HERE TO CHECK- TO GI. STONE STONE ARE. SIXTY TWO SIXTY TWO THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE AB THIRTY THIRTY BY MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SOME BILL THIRTY THIRTY- AND I'D LIKE TO OPEN BY BRIEFLY ADDRESSING RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL- THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO A LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL. WAS INADVERTENTLY CHANGE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE DEADLINE THE INCLUSION OF THE WORD SHALL. AND HOW THE THIRTY BY THIRTY GOAL BE IMPLEMENTED AS CRITICISM CONCERNS OF THIS BILL IS CREATING A GREATER MANDATE THEM WITH THE BILL'S SPONSORS AND I INTENDED. AB THREE THIRTY WAS CRAFTED TO ALIGN WITH EXISTING REQUIREMENTS AND AGENCY PROCESSES SUCH AS THE CURRENT BY DIVERSITY INITIATIVE AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WILL WORK WITH CONCERNED PARTIES TO ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE AND AMEND THE LANGUAGE A PROPERLY IN APPROPRIATIONS- AB THIRTY THIRTY CREATES A SET OF GOALS AND PRINCIPLES FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO ITS PART IN REVERSING THE WORLD WIDE BIODIVERSITY IN CHINA CRISES BY. ADOPTING THE GOAL PROTECTING 30% OF OUR LANDS WATERS AND OCEANS FOR CONSERVATION BY TWENTY THIRTY. THIRTY BY THIRTY. BY DOING SO CALIFORNIA WILL BE JOINING FACILITATED COURTED A GLOBAL CALLED ACTION NOT ONLY AMONG GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO. AMONG COMPANIES CITIES AND CITIZENS. THIS BILL PLACES AND A STATE POLICY COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOTED NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO CONSERVE NATURAL PLACES AND RESOURCES. PROTECTING 30% DOESN'T JUST MEAN MAKING MORE PARKS IN REMOTE CORNERS OF OUR STATE. IT ALSO MEANS IMPROVING ACCESS TO NATURE. FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THE STATE INCLUDING FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL COMMITS THE STATE TO DO JUST THAT. AND WE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER- AFTER THAT TO MAKE THESE COMMITMENTS. THIS ISSUE AS WE ALL KNOW IS PRESSING IN FACT THE CURRENT CRISIS EXACERBATES THE NEED FOR US TO MOVE QUICKLY. IN PRESERVING OUR LANDS AND WATERS. LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT PROTECTING 30% OF ALL LANDS WATERS AND OCEAN HABITATS IS THE BARE MINIMUM. NEEDED IN ORDER FOR US TO SAFEGUARD CLEAN AIR. CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND FOOD CHAINS THE SUPPORT ALL LIFE ON EARTH. BY PURSUING THESE AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE CONSERVATION GOALS WE CAN STILL PREVENTIVA JORDIE OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS FROM GOING EXTINCT. AND CUT BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN HALF. WHICH WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF EXISTING ECOSYSTEMS. WITHOUT ENOUGH OF NATURE PROTECTED WE WILL LOSE MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR SOCIETY. AND RISK THE LOSS OR DETERIORATION OF OUR FINITE RESOURCES AND STABLE CLIMATE. AS CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS ARE CHALLENGED BY THE CLOVER NINETEEN GLOBAL PANDEMIC. WHICH LIKELY WAS SPREAD FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS AS A RESULT OF HABITAT LOSS OF OVER EXPLOITATION. THE EFFECT OF THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS IN PEOPLE IS MORE PRONOUNCED THAN EVER. WE NEED TO PROTECT MORE OF NATURE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL IS CREATING PROTECTED AREAS. BUILDING ON PASS LEADERSHIP THE STATUTORY COMMITMENT FROM CALIFORNIA PROTECTORATE PRESENTED OF 30% OF OUR LANDS AND WATERS IN THE NEXT DECADE. WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WILDLIFE COTRIVED THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN ENJOY THE BENEFITS AN H. PROVIDES. AND THAT WILD AREAS CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE STRENGTH INVOLVED BILLING BEING.

WE MUST SET A GOAL OF THIRTY BY THIRTY WHICH WE CAN ACHIEVE THREE WEEKS THE THING LITTLE. TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND ALL THAT IT PROVIDES US.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STILL BE OVER HERE ON BEHALF THAT CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMENT OF THE AUTHOR ABOUT THE USE OF THE TERM SHALL THAT- IN THE BILL- LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION- AS A- BILL POTENTIALLY MOVES FORWARD. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT CURRENTLY IS A BRAND BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT- CB I AS ARE NOT A POEM IN A FOXHOLE LAND CONSERVATION PROTECTIONS IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE. OUR MEMBERS HAVE MASTER PLAN PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CONCERT IN MANY CASES AN UPWARDS OF NINETY PLUS PERCENT OF THE LAND ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PROJECTS. OUR MEMBERS ARE OFTEN THE FOUNDERS OF PARKS AND OPEN SPACE THROUGHOUT THEIR PROJECTS AND IT MANY TIMES FAR BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THEIR PROJECTS. WE WORK REGULARLY WITH CONSERVATION GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE ON REGIONAL CONSERVATION BASSMAN STRATEGIES AND FEES AND PEAS WILDLIFE CORRIDORS HABITAT CONNECTIVITY PROJECT. NAME A FEW WHAT IS CONSERVING DOUBTS ABOUT THE BILL IS REALLY IT'S BROADNESS AND THE PRACTICAL IMPACT THAT GOLD HAVE IMPLICATIONS. AND SETTING UNDEFINED AND AMBIGUOUS GOALS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR MAKING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING EVEN MORE LIKE HINGES THAN IT ALREADY IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE MIDST OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN TODAY. WE SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE RISE TO MORE LITIGATION. THIS BILL PROVIDES REALLY NO GUY HOW THESE GOAL SHOULD BE APPLIED TO STATE REGULATORY EFFORT. WITHOUT THAT CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE GUIDANCE WE ALL. KNOW BUT IT. GROUPS AND- THAT WILL TURN TO THE CORE TO THE QUESTIONS AND THE OTHER DAY WE BELIEVE IMPACT OF THE BILL IS TO BE TO THROW BADLY CROTCH INTO THE COURTS DRIVING UP THERE COST OR IT WORST CASE DAHLE IN THEM ALL TOGETHER THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES NO INSIGHT AS TO HOW PRIVATE PROPERTY WILL BE CONSIDERED IN CONTEXT OF THIS BILL HOW WILL IT BE LOCATED WHERE WILL IT BE LOCATED LIKE PROPERTY OWNER BE MADE AWARE OF AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN AND DISCUSS IT. SO REALLY THE IN THE DAY OUR CONCERN IS THAT EIGHTY THIRTY THIRTY BECOMES A TOOL TO TAKE APPROPRIATELY PLACED LAND OFF THE TABLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT FURTHER RESTRICTING BADLY NEEDED HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR THEIR DRIVING UP HOUSING PRICES IN CALIFORNIA THE CURRENTLY EXIST IN MERRY ADAM CONSERVATION TOWARDS THAT CATCHING THE GOLD A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY WITHOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO CLOSE REALLY WERE OPPOSED TO THIRTY THIRTY- BUT DO LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHO WANTS. TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. IT'S ARE AERICAN WE NOT HAVE ENOUGH WITNESSES THAT CORRECT.

AS WELL AS THE METHANE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS LIVESTOCK AND ORGANIC WASTE LIKE NOT SHELLS AND OTHER ORCHARD AND VINEYARD PROTEINS THAT ARE LEFT IN PILES TO DECAY THESE ARE ALL LARGE SOURCES OF METHANE EMISSIONS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CONVERTING THIS BIOMASS TO ENERGY CUTS BLACK CARBON AND METHANE EMISSIONS BY 98% COMPARED TO AN OPEN BAR. CONVERTING BIOMASS ENERGY IS ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IS A STATE TO GENERATE CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB BIOENERGY CAN PROVIDE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL THE NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS WE NEED TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID CENTURY. AB THREE ONE SIX THREE WILL REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS EMISSIONS AND GENERATE CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS Y PROVIDING A BENEFICIAL ALTERNATIVE TO LAND FEELING OR OPEN BURNING OF WHAT WASTE. AND OTHER CELLULOSIC WASTE THAT IS OT SUITABLE FOR COMPOST OR ANAEROBIC DIGESTION. EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF PIPELINE BY AMASSING INCREASE THE IN STATE PRODUCTION AND USE A BY AMASSING. GENERATED FROM NON COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGIES. AND UP I AM I THINK AND THEN BE USED TO REPLACE DIESEL AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OR BACKUP GENERATORS. IT CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AND IT CAN BE USED TO REPLACE ALSO FEEL GAS FOR HARD TO ELECTRIFY AND USES. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE OWE TO THE COMMITTEE TO PASS AB THREE ONE SIX THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC WHITE MEN THE DIRECTOR OF THE AFTER COUNTY FAIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT THE DISTRICT OF THE LOCAL AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARD THE PLASTER COUNTY. THE DISTRICT STRONG SUPPORT AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY GREAT BECAUSE THEY WILL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL AIR QUALITY BENEFITS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND PARTICULARLY IN THE WORLD COUNTY FETCHES BY AFTER. AFTER COUNTY LIKE ME WORLD BUT HELEN HERE COUNTY THAT HEAVILY FORESTED. AFTER COUNTY NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES REPORTS THAT COMPRISE NEARLY HALF OF THE COUNTY PLAN MAN. WITH IT COMES CHALLENGES WHICH REDUCING AIR QUALITY AND PASS A WILDFIRE RISKS FOR MANY RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE WILD LAND URBAN NFC. LIKE TO THIS ATTACK COMES BUT WHAT THE WILD FIRES A CONTROLLED BURN TO FORCE WAIT AND OTHER VEGETATION. IN FACT THE SINGLE LARGE FIRE CAN COST MILLIONS PERSON DATA UNHEALTHY AND DANGEROUS LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION. A THOMAS CAR CAMPFIRE THAT MADE THAT ALL TOO WELL KNOWN. IN ADDITION THE OPEN BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL WAIT WHICH HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE STATE AT THE EXISTING FILE MAPS WITH BECOMING A MAJOR SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN MANY REGIONS. SO THE DISTRICT AND THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAVE FOUND THAT CONVERTING BUT WASTING ENERGY CAN CAP PARTICULAR MATTER EMISSIONS BY NINETY EIGHT NINETY NINE PERCENT. COMPARED OPEN BURNING. WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE STATE HAS RECOGNIZED IN ELECTRICAL FACTOR THAT THE ELECTRICAL INSPECTOR AND PUT PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT IT. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE USE OF WHAT HE FILE MATH. TO REDUCE SMOG FORMING AND CRIME THAT POLLUTION EMISSIONS. WHILE PROVIDING IMPORTANT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND WHILE COMMUNITY. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THE DISTRICT'S STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL AND URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE. THANK YOU.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF REPUBLIC SERVICES WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS FOR AMENDING THE BILL AND WE SUPPORT THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT EITHER IN PERSON OR ON THE PHONE. OKAY SEEING AND HEARING NINE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF WE CAN PLEASE. HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT HIS KNOCKED OFF BOTH I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY EARTH JUSTICE. I JUST OPPOSE IT AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE CREATE A COSTLY PATHWAY TO MANUFACTURE METHANE METHANE IS A POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS WHAT IT ENTERED THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH HAPPENS WHAT LEAGUE FROM GOT PIPELINES OR WHEN GAS STORAGE FACILITIES LIKE A LEASE- CANYON RUPTURE. IT WORKED AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS. BOTTOM OUT DOES NOT ORDINARILY GENERATE SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF METHANE WHAT IT DECOMPOSES. THERMAL CONVERSION OF BIOMASS TO METHANE IS NOT PART OF THE STATE TO BE SHORT LIVED CIMATE POLLUTANTS STRATEGY. IN FACT ANALYSES OF CONVERSION OF BIOMASS TO METHANE HAVE CAUTIONED THAT THIS PROCESS CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION ONE METHANE LEAKAGE IS ACCOUNTED FOR. ON TOP OF THAT WHEN YOU BURN METHANE LIKE WE DO IN OUR GOT PLANTS IN JEFF POWERED APPLIANCES YOU GET KNOCKED AND OTHER AIR POLLUTANTS. CALIFORNIA POLICY SHOULD RETAIN ITS FOCUS ON REDUCING SOURCES OF METHANE AND RELIANCE ON GOD. NOT LIKE A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE PROPOSES. ENABLING NEWMAN COSTLY WAY TO MAKE IT. BUT CRITICS AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A USED FOR AGRICULTURAL WASTE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OPEN BURNED. I AM FOR WHICH THERE IS NO OTHER BENEFICIAL USE THE AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE IS NOT TAILORED TO THE BEACH DOCTOR NOR IS IT MAKING MAPPING- THE CARBONIZATION STUDIES LIKE THE LONG LIVERMORE LAB I SAY THAT WAS REFERENCED. BY THE ONE THE PROJECT BUT A BILL SPONSORED CONCLUDES BY ONE SHOULD BE YOU TO MAKE HIGH. WE DOES NOT HAVE A IN A POLLUTION OF METHANE. OTHER STUDIES POINT TO LIQUID FUEL WHICH CAN DISPLAY CARBON INTENSIVE AND DEFER TO ALLOW I. LIKE EIGHTY. IN FACT PROJECT TO CONVERT OUTWEIGHS HIDE ALL ALREADY MOVING FOR IN THE SENSE VALLEY. AND ALLOW CONVERSION TO MAP. AB ONE SIXTY. SETS OF OUR THE WRONG. AND DIVERT NEEDED FOCUS FROM THE SUPERIOR YOU. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON A THIRTY ONE SIX THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WOULD AN OFFICE PLEASE. THANK YOU ARE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I KNOW WHAT YOU WITH CENTER FOR DIVERSITY AND I'M A SPEAKS TO THE FOR ASKED OF THE. UNLIKE BY A DERIVED FROM ANAEROBE BECOME. OF WORK MATERIAL FROM SUCH AS LANDFILLS AND WASTE TREATMENT PLANT. WOULD WASTE PRODUCES MUCH SMALLER. IN LOWER DENT OF MY- FROM NOW THE CAMPUS. SPREAD OVER MANY YEARS DECADES. AS MUCH OF THE BIO MAT COME OVER. OR CORPORATE TO INTO THE SOIL. THE OF AB THREE ONE SIX THREE. WOULD LIKE US TO BELIEVE THE THIS BILL ACCOUNT FIRE EFFORTS INTO THE DISPOSAL OF FOR WAYS. THIS IS NOW WHAT THE BILL DOES AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY X. ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF ANY WOOD WOOD CHIPS AND WOOD WASTE WITH NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE WOULD WOULD OTHERWISE BE BURNED IN THE OPEN NOR ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THIS WOULD COME FROM KILLS REDUCTION PROJECTS. AS A RESULT THE CHEAPEST AND MOST LIKELY FEEDSTOCK AS WE ALREADY SEE AN BIOMASS FACILITIES IS RESIDUE FROM COMMERCIAL TIMBER OPERATION AND MALES. AND MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FORCED SOURCED WOULD BE BOMBING IS A SIGNIFICANT IN THAT CARBONI MATTER ONCE YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE ENFORCED IMPACTS AND EMISSIONS. AND EVEN IF THIS WERE FOR THE SAKE OF ACT. DEALING ON WITH EXISTING OF FORCED WASTE PRISON AVAILABLE FOR. FOREST TREES ARE EXPENSIVE TO CUT AND TRANSPORT AND PROCESS RECENT STUDY HAVE FOUND THAT NOTHING PRODUCE THE SAN CATHOLIC. WOULD BE EIGHT TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN NATURAL GAS AND IF USED FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION ALL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT BIOMASS GASIFICATION WOULD BE MANY TIMES THE COST OF SOLAR PLUS STORAGE. I PRE THE AUTHORS INTEREST AND IT. CALLUM'S ARE NO ENERGY. BUT THIS BILL MRS THE MARK AND WOULD BALLFORCED MANAGE AND INVEST IN. ENERGY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB THREE ONE SIX THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR ANY OTHER OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. CAN WE PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR ANY OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. IF THERE ARE ANY OPPONENT PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONLINE FIFTY THREE. YEAH GOOD MORNING THE PLANE INTHE CLEAN ENERGY I WE ARE FOR THE BUCK WITH A CAT ISSUE WE WANT CALLED THE YOUR CLIMATE THAT ALL ARE GOING TO BE BACK ON FROM THAT WHAT. MAKES YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER COLORS THE LINE IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT. ONE ZERO THE TIME BUT ONLINE. ONE THIRTY. THEY TOOK THEM OUT OF THE QUEUE IF YOU TO CUBA UP AT ONE ZERO. BUT ONLINE THIRTY SIX. HI THIS IS. CHENEY SO. THANK NATURAL RESOURCES AS HOW COOL. I DON'T THINK. CENTER EIGHT AND THE CALL. FOR AND FIND SET. AND A FULL SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP PROJECT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THANKS FOR. OKAY WE'VE LOST YOU. HELLO ARE YOU STILL THERE. OKAY YES HELLO YEAH WE LOST YOU ARE YOU IN SUPPORTER OPPOSITION OF. OPPOSITION OKAY I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT ON TO THE RECORD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT YEAR NEXT COLOR. OUR NEXT WELL THAT A LINE ONE FIFTY FIVE. HI HELLO YES HELLO. HI MORTGAGE HE MEANT- APOLOGY THAT MAN I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY THAT CAN GET THROUGH THE FIRST TIME ON BEHALF OF SO CAL GAS. WE ARE SUPPORTING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COLORS IT. MAXWELL THAT ALIGN ONE FIFTY THREE. HELLO THIS IS THE ARM ON THE FLOORS BUT THE VALLEY NATION COMMERCE WITH A PATIENT CALLING IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE SIX THREE. WELL THAT ALIVE. ONE SEVENTEEN. HELLO MY AND ONE SEVENTEEN. HI OUR CARLA I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT- ORGANIZATIONS BY AND WE WERE NOT ABLE TO HEAR EARLIER TODAY- AND CLOSE WHERE- IN OPPOSITION OF THIRTY ONE SIXTY THREE AB WHICH IS UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL YOUR CLUB CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR JUSTIN ACCOUNTABILITY INTERVIEWS WITH EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA BARBELLS UP. THE BLIND THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT COLOR. THERE'S NO ONE OUT THANK YOU AT THAT TIME THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WISHING TO VOICE OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WILL TAKE IT TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YES MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU MISTER CELIS OHIO. I'M FOCUSING ON THE ISSUE OF THEIR THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISAGREEMENT IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR THIS. WHAT IS THIS CALL TO THE SYNTHETIC PROCESS THE THERMAL CONVERSION OF BIOMASS. HAS A NET INCREASE OR DECREASE OF METHANE. YOUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL- TESTS FIVE THAT- THAT SAID THERE WOULD BE A NET REDUCTION. BUT I I'M AND LOOKING AT THE LETTER FROM THE SIERRA CLUB THAT NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL EARTH JUSTICE THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY- AND- THEIR INDICATED THAT IN FACT A BIO MASS LIKE WOULD. AN AGRICULTURAL CROP RESIDUE PRODUCE A MUCH SMALLER MORE DISPERSED VOLUMES OF METHANE OVER YEARS AND THAT THE SYNTHETIC PROCESS SUCH AS THERMAL CONVERSION OF BIOMASS TO NOTHING- ACTUALLY INCREASES- THE NET AMOUNT OF METHANE SO. YOU KNOW IT'S A DOZEN MAKES WELL- FIRST OF ALL COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT CONTRADICTION- YES THANK YOU WHEN ALL OUR- JULIA FROM BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL MORE SPECIFICALLY BUT- THIS ROAD CITY LET ME JUST TELL YOU THAT. LIVING IN THE VALLEY UC ALL OF THIS WASTE- BEING PILED UP AND FEEL THE BURN THEY PUT A MATCH TO IT WHICH GOES OUT INTO THE AIR IT'S A- PUBLIC HEALTH DETRIMENT UTILITY ASPER RATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD DO SOMETHING POSITIVE WITH ALL THAT WAY SUCH AS WITH AGRICULTURE BUT THINK ABOUT ALL THE BILLS WE VOTED ON HERE FOR FIRE MITIGATION- THE CAMPFIRE THE FIRE AND- THIS MODES DISTRICT LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE. LIKE ALL OF THAT WE SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THAT WHAT I'M SAYING WITH THIS BILL IS. LET'S DO SOMETHING POSSIBLE LET'S CONVERT THAT INTO GREEN ENERGY. AND FOR YOUR VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION ALL OF THE TO BEST FROM BY ON ALSO SEE. THANK YOU. HOW AT THE THREE TWO OKAY I THINK THAT WE HAVE BUT ASK FOR A WITNESS TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION. YEAH OKAY YEAH IS THERE SOMEONE IN THE VIDEO ROOM TO HELP THE WITNESS ANSWER THE QUESTION. CAN SOMEONE TURN THIS ON YES WHERE YOU'RE ON NOW- GOOD OKAY SORRY. HI THIS IS JULIE ELEVEN AGAIN WITH THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MISUNDERSTANDING IN THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO FOREST OR AGRICULTURAL WASTE A LOT OF THAT WASTE IS BEING MECHANICALLY SENT PURSUANT TO STATE LAW SB NINE A ONE WHICH REQUIRES A DOUBLING OF FORCE YOU'LL REMOVE ALL. THE REALLY ONLY A FEW OPTIONS WITH IT CAN BE PILED AND LEFT TO ROT IN WHICH CASE IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF METHANE. BUT ACTUALLY THE FAR MORE DAMAGING ALTERNATIVE USE IS TO PILOT UP AND BURN IT OR TO DO PRESCRIBE FIRE IN THE FOREST BOTH OF WHICH ARE MAJOR SOURCES OF BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS. BLACK CARBON IS FORTY THREE TOP IS MORE DAMAGING TO THE CLIMATE EVEN THE NOTHING WHICH IS SEVENTY FOUR TIMES WERE DAMAGING CARBON DIOXIDE. SO THE OPPONENTS ARE IGNORING THE VERY SIGNIFICANT BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS FROM BURNING A FORCE WASTE OR WILD FIRES WERE BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE. THEIR FIRE WEATHER CONTROL OVER OF OURS DO ALL THESE NOTHING AND SO IS THIS PURPOSE MATERIALIZE LEFT FILE STRIP. THE OPPONENTS ARE ALSO. URBAN WOULD. THE MAJORITY OF THE ORGANIC. ORGANIC WASTE IS CURRENTLY TO LANDFILLS WHICH HAS TO BE DIVERTED BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE VAST MAJORITY IS CELLULOSIC WASTE. WHEN IT GOES TO A LANDFILL WHETHER THAT'S URBAN WOULD WASTE OUR YARD TRêN MEANS OR CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS. IN A LANDFILL IT ALSO RELEASES METHANE LEAKAGE THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES WERE LEAKAGE FROM LANDFILLS IS MUCH HIGHER. THAN LEAKAGE FROM PIPELINES. SO IF YOU RELY ON THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD OR THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. THEIR ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE NET REDUCTION IS CARBON EMISSIONS. FROM BIOMASS CONVERSION. THANK YOU I UP IF I MAY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO. COM AND I AND I WANT TO GET INTO A BACK AND FORTH BUT- THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION DOES DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE BY A METHANE DERIVE FROM. THE ANAEROBIC DECOMPOSITION- IN FROM LANDFILLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS. YOU KNOW I I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL TOWARDS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY FOUNDATION I KNOW THAT THERE IS A REAL DILEMMA IN TERMS OF WHAT TO DO WITH. WITH THE WHAT PRODUCTS- THAT WET WEATHER FROM FOREST THINNING OR- OR FOREST MANAGEMENT OF OVER OR OTHER SOURCES- BUT IT IT JUST. SEEMS CONTRADICTORY TO ME THAT THAT WE'RE SPENDING ALL THIS EFFORT AND MONEY TO TRY TO CUT DOWN ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS OWN STATEMENT THAT. METHANE EMISSIONS IS ONE OF THE MOST DAMAGING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND YOU KNOW AND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE CREATING THIS- THIS PRESIDENT OF WITH THE POTENTIAL OF ACTUALLY INCREASING- METHANE PRODUCTION RATHER THAN DECREASING FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS EGGMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SOLACE. BUT I'M GONNA I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I JUST AT IT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE ALL CLEAN ENERGY BUT THE FACT REMAINS WE CURRENTLY HAVE BY PRODUCTS FROM OUR ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN LESS WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TREES ANYMORE. I CAN HAVE ORCHARDS CHERRY SEASON RIGHT NOW ON A FEW DRIVEN AROUND ON THE EAST SIDE OF US I'M LOOKING COUNTY HELLO CHERRY TREES GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT NEED TO BE PRUNED AND THEN SOMETHING DON'T THAT WASTE AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING AROUND AFTER PRUNING TIME AND THERE'S AN OPEN BURN GOING ON AND IT'S FOGGY OUTSIDE. IT IS SO HARD TO BREED IT IS HARD TO BREATHE A WORD TO MASK INSIDE- SAID THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM IS WHAT WE HAVE WE'RE DEALING ITH REALITY RIGHT NOW AND REALITY RIGHT NOW IS OPEN BURNS OCCUR PLEASE HOLD ME THINK AND HAVE TERRIBLE IMPACTS ON SPECIALLY IN OUR IN OUR VALLEY. ON ON AIR SO I WOULD PUTTING HIS BILL TO. I'M WITH RESPECT TO MY AT. MY COLLEAGUES OBJECTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER MANY MEMBERS MATHIS. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR- COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS MISTER SALAS- I JUST WANNA WANNA CONFIRM MOM WITH YOU THERE'S SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS BILL MIGHT BE CAUGHT- MANDATE- FOR PROCUREMENT AND I JUST WANNA YOU TO ADDRESS THAT- IT AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT. BACK AGAINST IT SOME OF THESE OPPOSITION LETTERS TO THE BILL I THINK THERE'S SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT FORGET THAT WERE ALL CARBON BASED LIFE FORMS- AND CARBON IS NOT GOING AWAY IN THIS IDEAL OF CARBON ZERO IS. TOBY IN FAIRY TALE IN THE BEST WE CAN SHOOT FOR IS A CARBON NEUTRAL- STANDARD AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE PRODUCTS AND WITH THIS WASTE. THAT IS OTHERWISE GOING TO HARM US IN OTHER WAYS- IN AGAIN- BEING YOUR NEIGHBOR THE VALLEY WE SEE THIS. EVERY SINGLE FIRE SEASON WE SEE THIS THROUGH ACT PRODUCT WASTE THROUGH OPEN BURN PITS- THERE'S DEFINITELY A WAY TO HARNESS THIS ENERGY THAT IS OTHERWISE BEING WASTED- THROUGH THE PROCESS AND TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S VALUABLE THAT HELPS GO TOWARDS- OUR GOALS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I'D LIKE TO JUMP IS A JOINT AUTHORED WITH YOU AS LONG AS IT'S NOT GONNA BE A MANDATE. FOR THE PROCUREMENTS AND- HELP YOU MOVE THIS THING FOR THANK. THANK YOU JUST WRAP THE ELEMENT FIRST ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT THAT NOW IT'S NOT A MANDATE. AND SECONDLY I THINK THIS IS WHY- TO YOUR SECOND ONE I THINK THIS IS WHY YOU SEE EVERYBODY FROM THE CLEAN ENERGY GROUPS TO THE- AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS TO THE PREFERRED POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED. AND ALSO THE WASTE MANAGEMENT GROUPS I THINK THEY ALL SEE THIS AS A WAY TO TACKLE- THIS POLLUTION A AND LET'S TURN IT INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE IT TO CLEAN ENERGY AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE BROAD SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS OTHER COME ALIVE MANY. MR SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE HI THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THERE'S OVER YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE I SAY RANGING FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT TO WASTE MANAGEMENT TO CLEAN ENERGY GROUPS THAT ALL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S POSITIVE LEADS US INTO- IT TO THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE SET OUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY PROVDING. ADDITIONAL CLEAN ENERGY AND SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR LIVE OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A MOTION. I THINK WE'VE A MOTION AND A SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE.

AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHO HAVE A- SHOWN INTEREST IN SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT. LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION ON THE BILL EXCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO WHAT IS NOW THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WHILE FIRE PREVENTION SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY. POLICY CALIFORNIA'S FACING A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN HISTORY AS MANY EXPERTS ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE STATE IS EXPECTED TO ENTER. DEVASTATING EFFECTS TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DUE TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS- IN OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE SEEN THOSE IMPACTS- DIRECTLY IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES- WHETHER IT BE DIRECTLY ON FORESTRY ISSUES- DRINKING WATER ISSUES AGRICULTURE SHOES AND THAT CERTAINLY. ARE THE OVERALL IMPACT PUBLIC OUT THERE WILL BE. IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. FOR INSTANCE ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT BY TWENTY FIFTY HEAT WAVES ARE SPECULATED TO POTENTIALLY BECAUSE TWO TO THREE MORE HEAT RELATED DEATHS ARE THE NORMAL THIS INCREASE IN HE COULD ALSO LEAD TO A LOSS OF MOISTURE AND FALL WITH AN AGRICULTURE. AND BY MID CENTURY PORTION OF THE STATE'S AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION MAY FACE WATER SHORTAGES OF UP 216% SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY CONCERNED WITH AS IT RELATES TO AGRICULTURE. THE IMPACTS IT HAS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY TO THE OVERALL FOOD SUPPLY- OF THE WORLD WATER SHORTAGES DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMMUNITIES ALREADY BURDENED BY. BERMAN POLLUTION AS A AND- RISING COSTS A WATER SHORTAGE OF WATER SUPPLY- THAT'S CERTAINLY SECRET TO ANYONE HERE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND SIZE OF WILDFIRES. WITH FIFTEEN OF TWENTY LARGEST FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY OCCURRENCES NEARLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ACRES OF LAND BURNING CAL ACCORDING. CAL FIRE WE NOW HAVE THE RESPONSE TO THAT DEMONSTRATES THE CLIMATE CHANGE IN ITS STATED ACOSTA EFFECT RAPID APPROACH WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE. WE MUST ASK QUICKLY AND ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS. AGAIN THE RIVER SYSTEM WOULD CLAP CHANGE TO CREATE A CLEAN AND GREEN UPS MOVING FOR. OTHERS RECENT STUDY THAT CAME OUT AGAIN I'VE UP ABOUT THE INFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THE- STUDY BY THE BAY CON LIKE GETS IT A PACKAGE OF CLIMATE. SIX AND CAL. THE BUTTON SUPPORT NEARLY HUNDRED POINT FULL TIME EQUIVALNT JOBS. WITH INVESTMENT OF EIGHT BILLION- BEING SPENT HERE. IN CALIFORNIA WITH A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE AROUND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS CAN BE. GENERALLY PRODUCED- FOR OUR STATE JOBS THAT COULD RANGE FROM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATORS TO. ENGINEERS AND PUTTING MANY PEOPLE TO WORK TO PUT THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE SIX POINT TWO. MILLION JOBS PER WHAT EVERY SIX POINT SIXTEEN POINT TWO JOBS FOR EVERY MILLION DOLLARS TO PROTECT OUR WATER. FIFTEEN POINT NINETY JOBS FOR EVERYONE MILLION PROTECTING OUR CALLS AND TWELVE POINT FOUR. FIVE FOR JOBS A PER MILLION AND REGIONAL RESILIENCY ALL WHICH ARE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT JOBS. AB THIRTY TO FIFTY SIX PUTS BEFORE THE VOTERS A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE TO MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS AND PROVIDE COMMUNITIES GREEN JOBS. AS WE CONTINUE TO COMBAT THE ECONOMIC REPORT OF COURSE NINETEEN. WILL NOT ASK YOU SOME REMOTE TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY- TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AS WELL. THANK YOU MR GARCIA MANAGER MEMBERS AS MY COLLEAGUE ALLUDED TO WE ARE LIVING IN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES IS A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS ENDANGERS THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF CALIFORNIANS EVERY DAY. TO COVER NINETEEN AND SUBSEQUENT SHELTER PLACE ORDERS CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THAT EXCEEDS WHAT WE EXPERIENCED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. THESE THESE FACTS ARE NOTHING NEW TO ALL OF YOU ON THAT. DAY YES CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO REBUILD AND IN A WAY THAT WILL PROTECT OUR STATE AGAINST FUTURE DISASTERS THAT UNLIKE KOBE NINETEEN WE KNOW ARE COMING THESE DISASTERS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SPOKE TO. ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CAN BE MITIGATED IF WE ACT QUICKLY AND INVEST ACCORDINGLY. AB THIRTY TO FIFTY SIX SIX TO HELP REBUILD OUR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WILL ALSO PREPARING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. BY PLACING A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT TO FINANCE VARIOUS CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE ACTIVITIES WILL NOT JUST CREATE NEW JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH GREEN JOBS WHICH ARE OFTEN LONG TERM. AND HELP US REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS AREA COUNCIL INSTITUTE INDICATES 752-002-0000 A JOBS CAN BE CREATED STATEWIDE. WITH THE BOND OF THIS MAGNITUDE AS THE NEED FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS RISE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CRISIS WITH CURRENTLY FACE PROVIDE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK. RESHAPE HOW WE LIVE TOGETHER. ON THIS EARTH LET'S NOT LET THAT OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY PASSES BY IN WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WITNESSES LISTED IN SUPPORT- SO IF THERE ARE NO WITNESSES I'LL ASK THE MODERATOR TO PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR ANYONE WISHING TO- OFFER SUPPORT.

OKAY SEEING NONE WILL NOW COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MR STONE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS BOTH. MR MULLIN MR GARCIA I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TALKING IN THIS ONE FOR AWHILE. I THINK THIS BOND IS GOING TO BE ON AN INTERESTING JOURNEY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE GENERAL FUND IS GOING TO DO. WHAT THE STATE BUDGET IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE BUT I DO SEE THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LIE TO LEVERAGE. ITS GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS IN RESILIENCE AND TRADITION ORIGINALLY THIS IS START OFF WITH CLIMATE RESILIENCE BUT THE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS AND I THINK WE CAN CERTAINLY DO BOTH. ONE OF THE THINGS I WILL JUST THAT I HAD BEEN TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING ABOUT QUITE A BIT BEFORE WHEN WE'RE SOME OF THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE PART OF WHEN THIS WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON RESILIENCE OF THE CLIMATE. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IS WE HAVE YET TO CREATE. REAL STANDARDS AROUND WHAT THAT RESILIENCE MEANS. AND MY FEAR FOR. JUST COMING UP WITH ANOTHER POT OF MONEY IS IT WILL GET SPENT ON THINGS THAT ARE JUST AND EVERYBODY'S Q. BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF. THE SUPPORT THE SUPPORT AMEND IT IF AMENDED BY THE CONCERNS RAMPS ARE PHOTO. JUST LOOK FOR DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY TO CONTINUE THE PROJECTS THAT THEY HAVE HAD. BUT IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE STANDARDS FOR WHAT RESILIENCE MEANS HOW WE PLAN FOR THE APPROPRIATE PRODUCT PROJECTS. UP IN THE COMMUNITIES IN IT WITH THE AGENCIES THAT WILL BE. TAKING ON THIS MONEY THEN WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE SPENT. FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED. IN THE IN THE BOX SO FOR GONNA SELL IT IS RESILIENCE WHETHER CLIMATE RESILIENCE. OR ECONOMIC RESILIENCE AND WHEN HE GETS ON THE BALLOT THAT'S PROBABLY HOW IT'S GOING TO GET SPENT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY GETS SPENT FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE MONEY. BUT I AM ALSO HOPING THAT IN THE BOND FOR THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS WE BUILD IN AND FUND AND HELP OUT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ESPECIALLY WHO ARE GOING TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE- INS AND RECOVERY OVER THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT THESE INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO COME WITH WAYS OF HELPING THOSE JURISDICTIONS. DO THE PLANNING. NECESSARY AND THAT WE STATE APPROPRIATE STANDARDS SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE THOSE PROJECTS AND THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S- PARTLY THIS BOND IT'S PARTLY OUTSIDE OF THIS BOND BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE. A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE SEE THOSE. HELLO JURISDICTIONS DO PLANNING. THEY DIDN'T HAVE MY- IN THE OLD. TO DO THAT PLANNING THERE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE LESS OF THAT NOW SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND WE'RE GONNA PUT MONEY LIKE THIS ON THE TABLE THAT IT MEETS. INSURE THAT IT MEETS ALL OF THOSE. OBLIGATIONS I THINK AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS MONEY REPRESENTS. BUT I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND THAT'S JUST AS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION I KNOW WE WILL KICK TEN YOU'D HAVE IT. IT IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ONLY MEN AND- CANDIDLY ADMIT I WEAR HEARING AIDS AND I READ LIPS SO I CALLED ABOUT 75% OF IT BOTH THE SEPTEMBER SENATE CALL WAS WAS EXCELLENT. AND I FULLY AGREE AND COMPANION LEGISLATION THAT WILL WRAP AROUND ANY KIND OF A BONTA EFFORT. THAT WILL ADDRESS THE REGIONAL PLANNING CONCERNS I KNOW THAT CAR WITH. KILLER GOING TOWARDS PEACE. BASE WITH. THE REGIONAL INPUT AT INCENTIVES BUILT IN HURT THE ENCOURAGE REGION TO DO THE APPROPRIATE PLANNING SO WE'RE NOT JUST COME UP WITH A BUNCH OF PORK PROJECTS. BASED ON SCIENCE THAT. PULL SO AS AROUND. REGIONAL PATIENT PROJECT EXCEL. IT BUT I WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LEAST MOST OF IT AND I MAKE I WILL MAKE THAT INCORPORATE ALL OF INTO THE AND WE'RE I JUST WANT TO PUT THE CALM OUT THERE AMERICAN TALK ABOUT IS I TALKED AND OR ANY THESE OTHER. HOUSE GIVE THAT THAT WARNING IF THEY'RE EXPECT TO JUST OPEN UP A PIPELINE TRADITIONAL MONEY THEY SHOULD THINK AGAIN AND THEY NEED TO BE OUR PARTNERS IN ESTABLISHING THE RULES THOSE HAITIANS AND HELPING. COLLECTIVELY UNDERSTOOD HOW INSURED. AS THAT MONEY GETS WE GO BACK TO PUBLIC AND SAID WE ASK YOU TO VOTE ON RESILIENCE BONDS. WE GET WHETHER IT'S CLIMATE OR ECONOMIC. WE ASK YOU TO VOTE ON THOSE THIS IS HOW WE'RE ASSURING THAT WE ARE MEETING THOSE GOALS- IN THE IN THE LONG RUN SO I THINK WE'RE- DEFINITELY AGREEMENT ON IT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- WE'RE CLEAR IN THIS HEARING THAT. OF THAT ADDITIONAL NEED. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN. YEAH I. MICHAEL ABOUT THE LINE. NO LONGER READING ABOUT ALL WATCHED. ALSO SCHOOL. YEAH OUR. SO THAT'S YOU GO INTO. WE ARE IN THE I. HOW TO SELECT. TAX AND THIS. OUR REALLY WITH. REALLY SB WITH ME ASSESSING. RIGHT EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW SO OURSELVES MY WISELY AREA OR WE NEED TO FIND. TO YEAH MAKE SURE. THAT FOR THOSE. THIS IS NOT NORMAL PRODUCTION. EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMMITTEE MEASURE MEMBER I'M SORRY. SO I JUST LIKE TO KIDDING TO PLEASE BE SURE YOU SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE THINK THEY'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE A HEARING SUCH TO. TRY TO CATCH IT SO. SIX YEAH. THANK YOU. FOR I'M MISS GARCIA. AT THE YOU I'M A DRAIN ON THERE ON ON THIS BOMB AND WITH REALLY ENTHUSIAST ABOUT IT. CREATE ARE COULD BE THE CAUSE IN NINETEEN REALITY THAT WERE AND B. I FELT THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK NOT JUST WITH THE BOND BUT WITH ALL OTHER FUNDING AND I GENERAL FUND THEN OUR GHGS TO ELEVATE THE CLEAN THEIR WORK THAT IS NEEDED IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S A PIECE IN HERE THAT ADDRESSES HEAT ISLANDS. NOT ENOUGH I FEEL FOR MY DISTRICT TO GET ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE PIE AFTER A PACE AND FOR THE WORKING CLASS DISTRICT THAT THAT I'M THAT I'M IN BUT I AN OPPORTUNITY- AND THAT ABILITY IN OUR NEW REALITY DO NOT CLEAR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE BUT WITH THE GO. THERE'S BEEN RUMORS OF GIGI MONIES COMPLETELY. FOR OTHER DAY BEYOND THEN AND YOU KNOW BEING THAT LEFT THERE. CLEANER INITIATIVE NOR ON AND PROBABLY NOT. I LOOK AT AT THE F. I DE THINK THAT SEVERE PRIORITY AND RESEARCH PORTER BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THERE IS STILL IN THE PAR THE WATER PARK ADAPTATION PART. THAT IS. WE ARE COMING TO FRUITION. ALONG THE WAY SOME A I'M REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION BECAUSE IF I'M GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS- FOR THIS SPACE I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY DISTRICT TO THAT IS IN DIRE NEED IS GETTING THAT'S FOR SURE THE PIE THAT MY LOOK SMALLER CITIES. THAT ARE BEING HIT- ARE GONNA BE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SAFE MORE ON LAND SO I ASSUME. YOU TODAY. ABOUT THAT I'M CURRY SEE WHAT BECAUSE I OF THE MAYBE TO. I DE. YOU KNOW MY COMMITMENT HI CHANGE ON TO FIGHTING THAT HAS AND NOT HAS NO WAVERED. BUT I THINK I NEED TO SEE THINGS A DIFFERENT REALITY MOVING. MOVING FORWARD I REALLY IF YOU SEE A WIRE BUDGET IS AT NINE SO JUST IN A REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION AT THIS POINT. TO VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT SO MANY AND SO MANY UNKNOWNS. AND A LOT OF FEAR THAT I'M GOING TO REVERT TO SPACE WE WERE AT BEFORE I GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHERE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WERE ALWAYS THE- END OF THE LINE AND WE SEE LITTLE TO NOTHING FROM A LOT OF THESE BONDS- ALONG THE LAND SO. I APOLOGIZE THAT I HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION FOR YOU KNOW I HAVE A LITTLE BIT TIME PASSED TODAY TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT. I'LL BUT A LOT HAS ADDITION TO WITH WITH LOWER WITH THIS. ONE THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. WELL ALL THE SAD- WANNA THINK MISTER MULLIN MR GARCIA. THEY'RE VERY HARD WORK ON THIS- AS A PROUD TO AN AUTHOR OF THE MEASURE I CAN FIRST OF ALL TELL MY COLLEAGUES AND SOME OF HEM BEEN IN A LOT OF THOSE METINGS- THAT THESE ARE ALL EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE TOPICS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. I'D SAY ABOUT A MONTH AGO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE CHANCES FOR THIS FARM GOING FORWARD GIVEN THE IMPACT ON THE GENERAL FUND. BUT WE'VE BEEN HAVING ALL OF A LOT OF US KIND OF ON THE SIDE TALKS WITH ECONOMISTS AND- OTHERS WHO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. A CUSTOM. TO REALLY FOSTER FASTER RECOVERY I'M OUT OF THIS RECESSION THIS CODE AND BECAUSE RECESSION. AND RIGHT NOW. INTEREST RATES ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS. AND SO GIVEN THAT THERE ARE CO BENEFITS BESIDES STIMULUS FOR STIMULUS THE SAKE AND JOB CREATION FOR JOB CREATION SICK WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT IF WE CAN ALSO HAVE THE CO BENEFITS OF. INCREASING OUR WATER RESILIENCY. OF INCREASING OUR WORK ON WILD FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. ON INCREASING OF OUR RESILIENCY FROM THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS THE NEXT COMING CRISIS. THEN WE ALSO CAN MAKE FOR. A SAFER STATE WELL WE STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY- SO I DO THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO THE DISCUSSION. ON THIS BOND AGAIN I. IN THE THAT'S BEEN DONE WHEN I YOU. AND THAT WE HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MADAM CHAIR I THINK YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND REALLY POINT OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT. THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN BOB BETWEEN THE WORK GROUP AND- WHAT LIES AHEAD IN THE COMING. DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AS WAS MENTIONED BY. FOR CALLING FROM SANTA CRUZ. THE FACT THAT MATTERS IS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. RE PRIORITIZE. AT NOT JUST THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE SET FORWARD IN OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. BUT HOW WE TRULY NED BILLS- OPPORTUNITIES- DOWN ON THE GROUND IN THE AREAS THAT ARE. DISPROPORTIONATELY ALSO IMPACTED. AND HELP GENERATE BILLS. GOOD JEAN CLEAN JOBS AS WE WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE FORWARD AND- EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN GREATER RESILIENCY ARE TO CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M HOPEFUL THAT- AS WAS IN THE MAKE IN THE JANUARY. PRESENTATION THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD THERE WERE ALREADY A LOT OF- COMMITMENTS THAT WERE BEING FORESEEN- TO BE FUNDED. BY SOMETHING LIKE THIS PARTICULAR BOND WE'LL FIND OUT THE- FRIDAY. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE STILL AN INCLINATION TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION- BUT- WE'VE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ECONOMIC TASK FORCE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A CENTERPIECE TO WHATEVER MASTER PLAN THEY COME UP WITH FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM ECONOMIC RECOVERY- PATHWAYS WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING UNTIL WE'RE TOLD THE- NOT TO. AND RESPECTFULLY- WOULD ASK THAT YOU GIVE US A YOUR SUPPORT SO THAT WE HAVE- THE VEHICLE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO AT THE RIGHT MOMENT- BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS TO. OF LAWS THE END GOAL BE THE- TO HELP CALIFORNIANS GET BACK ON THE PATH OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR APPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A MOTION.

SIX TO THREE THANK YOU SIXTY THREE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN- FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THE BILL IS OUT NEXT WE ARE MOVING TO AB TWENTY SIX NINETEEN BY MARK STONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY SIX NINETEEN ESTABLISHES A PROGRAM FOR COASTAL RESILIENCE ADAPTATION ACCESS. TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS SEALEVEL RISE AND. BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THE STATE HAS PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM. THAT WAS COLLECTING MONEY FROM THE HIGHLANDS WILL RESUME REVENUES AND WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN PUT TO NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION EFFORTS THAT MONEY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WAS SWEPT INTO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND AND LAST YEAR WE TRIED TO TAKE A PIECE OF THAT AGAIN THIS YEAR THIS BILL DOES THE SAME THING TAKES A PIECE OF. MONEY THAT WAS IT TENDED FOR COASTAL RESOURCES AND TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE FLEXIBLE MONEY TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE IN OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES ALONG THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHERE THAT MONEY WAS INTENDED SO WE ARE AGAIN ASKING THAT WE TAKE SOME OF THAT THAILAND WILL REVENUES COMING TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO LOOK RESTRICTIONS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE PLANTING NECESSARY BEFORE WHAT WE KNOW IS. AND WAS THAT WHEN YOU OUT ABOUT AND I KNOW YOU'RE CAN. ABOUT IMPACT ON STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE THIS IS WILL TAKE MONEY OUT OF STATE GENERAL FUND. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY NECESSARY NOW UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION THEY ARE MONIES THAT ARE BEING ALLOCATED NOW AND THE BOND WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SHOULD THAT BOND MOVE FORWARD. THERE WILL BE MONIES BEING DISTRIBUTED DOWN TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE BILL'S LOCAL AGENCIES ARE BEING STARVED TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT. THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASK THEM TO BUILD RESILIENCE AND RESILIENT TYPE PROGRAMS INTO. THEIR FUTURE PLANNING AND YET THEY HAVE NO MONEY TO DO SO AND THERE'S- REALLY VERY RARELY ARE THERE MONIES. ALLOCATED TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT KIND OF PLANNING. THAT'S WHAT THIS MONEY IS DESIGNED FOR IT WILL BE FAIRLY BROADLY AVAILABLE. BUT ESPECIALLY TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO THE PLANNING AND TO DO THE MECHANISMS THAT WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THE MONEY ON. OR THAT WE ARE AS A STATE ASKING THEM TO SPEND MONEY ON. ACTUALLY GIVING THEM GRANT TO THE ON OTHER MECHANISM THAT ARE AVAILABLE NOW. THAT THIS IS TIMELY AND IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE ARE EFFORTS THAT NEED TO BE ONGOING EVEN AS WE DEAL WITH. THE COVERED CRISIS THE PANDEMIC IN AS WE COME OUT OUT OF IT. THE BOND MONEY AND OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PUT TO USE OUR WILL BE PART OF. ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACROSS EIGHT OF CALIFORNIA BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL AND ITS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO DO. PLANET AND BE ABLE TO INSURE. THAT THE PROJECTS THAT WE THEN GIVE THE MONEY FOR FIT INTO RESILIENCE STRATEGIES FOR CALIFORNIA. WILL BE THROWING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. SO YES THIS IS PROPOSING TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE STATE'S GENEAL FUND. WILL FIGHT THAT FIGHT AND APPROPRIATIONS WE LOST HIS LAST YEAR. IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS I THINK OVER BECAUSE OF OBJECTIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH. BERMAN FINANCING CONTINUE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. IF NOT THIS. THEN WHAT HOW DO WE HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. ASSIST OF MONEY TO DO. THE GRANT WRITING THEY TO DO. TO DO THE PLANNING THEY NEED TODO SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD TOWARD RESILIENCE AND THAT THAT WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO DO AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. SO WE I DO HAVE A WITNESS AND SUPPORT FROM THE AUDUBON SOCIETY. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

ON ISSUES RUNCIE LONG OF. AND WE HAVE NO GUARANTEES THAT WHATEVER MONEY WE HAVE CUED UP OR IS CURRENTLY BEING. BEING SPENT. WILL MEET OUR GOALS OF RESILIENCE AND WHETHER IT'S WILD FIRES. WERE SEALEVEL RISE OR ANY OTHER ASPECTS OF IT WE HAVE NOT BUILT INTO ANY OF THE MECHANISM PLANNING MECHANISMS. IN CALIFORNIA TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. MEET THEIR GOALS THAT WE ARE EXPECTING OF THAT SO YEAH I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT. HITS TO THE GENERAL FUND BUT IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL THEN MONEY WILL BE BEING SPENT AND WE HAVE NO IDEA. WHETHER R NOT THAT MONEY WILL BE HELPING TO MEET THE GOALS OF RESILIENCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL THIS IS MONEY THAT'S NECESSARY IT'S TYPICALLY NOT PUT INVOLVED. WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN WILLING TO FIND PLACES FOR MONEY TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MEET THIS GOAL THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUE TO DO THIS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT EVEN IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

HI DELUDE CAN HEAR ME WE HAVE THE LOUIS YES. HI HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY TESTIMONY MY NAME IS LOUIS BRONTE I'M THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BE. I TELL YOU MY COMMENTS BRIEF- BUT I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE A MY COLLEAGUE ADAM AGO WILL COVER THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE BILL AND I'M GONNA FRIENDLY OVERALL HOW DO COUNTY CALIFORNIA THAT MAKES US FEEL THIS BILL MAKES. SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA FACES THAT YOU PROBABLY KNOW A HISTORIC THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOME SHORTAGE ONE RENDERED IN PAINFUL CLARITY BY CO THE NINETEEN. AT PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO MAKE RENT SHELTER IN PLACE OR DEAL WITH THE UNIQUE INTERSECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS HOME WITH. CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUELY DIFFICULT TO BUILD HOUSING IN AND PROCESS REFORM THAT GET DEVELOPMENT CERTAINTY ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE MADE A 21% REDUCTION IN THE HOUSING PERMITS FOR THIS YEAR FROM PREVIOUS PRODUCTIONS- DOES PROJECTIONS- I HAD SUGGESTED THAT PRE CODE PRODUCTION FOR THAT YEAR WITH ONLY GOING TO BE ABOUT HALF. OF THE ANNUAL NEED TO PREVENT PRICES FROM RISING BEYOND INFLATION. AND WITH LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF THE NEED IF WE WERE TO ACTUALLY RESOLVE OUR- SHORTAGE BY TWENTY. THE NINETEEN ALMOST CERTAINLY CREATE CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT UNCERTAINTY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR NOT LONGER. I WHICH COULD CAUSE A CATASTROPHIC DECREASE IN HOME BUILDING A COMMENSURATE INCREASE IN THE COST OF HOUSING. ADJUSTED COMPELLING IS THE NEED TO PUT CALIFORNIA'S BACK TO WORK AND RAISE REVENUE FOR LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. A RECENT STUDY FINDS THAT BUILDING A THOUSAND HOMES CREATE TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FULL TIME JOBS. AND GENERATE ALMOST A HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXES AND FEES. FOR ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT POLICE FIREFIGHTERS AND SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS OF HOUSING WITH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS JOBS AND THAT'S REVENUE. OF IT HE HAD MADE THE NEED FOR HOUSING REFORM ALL THE MORE CLEAR. FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT BILLS AB THIRTY TO SEVENTY NINE. THAT MAKE HOMEBUILDING EITHER AND THE THIRD IS. A COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR MUCH. IS OUT OF THE LINE. WE DO HAVE ANOTHER FROM LINE TO NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. APOLOGIES VICE CHAIR AND MADAM CHAIR I HELPED ALLEN THE TELECONFERENCE- TORY- THIS IS ADAM REGULARLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AT DEFINE. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AB THREE TWO SEVEN NINE PROPOSES INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO THE PEOPLE PROCESS. IT WILL ALLOW MORE HOUSING COULD BE BUILT WITH LEFT DELAYS AND LOWER COSTS. THE BILL STRIKE IMPORTANT BALANCE OF DRAFTING THE COMMODORES DISTILLATE FROM PEOPLE EDUCATION. WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE STATUTE'S OBJECTIVE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL WOULD BE AT THE TIME FRAME COURT OF APPEALS NEED TO HEAR A SEQUEL CASE TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. OF THE DATE OF FILING THE APPEAL CHALLENGING A PROJECT. I EXPEDITE THE TIME FRAME COURT OF APPEALS MUCH YOUR CHALLENGE. THE BILL ENSURE THE MORE TIMELY RESOLUTION OF PEOPLE LITIGATION AND THAT MORE HOUSING PROJECT ANOTHER LAND HE'S PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD. TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY THE OBLIGATION BILLY AGENCY- HAVE UNDER SEQUEL- TO IDENTIFY ALL POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. AND TO ADOPT ALL FEASIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES THAT WOULD ELIMINATE. OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ANY OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. WITH AN EXISTING HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE CO THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE BELIEVE THESE MODEST CHANGES PROPOSED BY EIGHTY THREE TWO SEVEN NINE WILL EXPEDITE MUCH NEEDED HOUSING PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT COMPLETING THE PROTECTIONS THAT PEOPLE PROVIDE. WE ASK HERE FIVE A THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND TELECOM PURGATORY RIGHT NOW SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE- ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

BUT I AM HERE TO SPEAK- AND POLITENESS NOT PROFESSIONS. SHALL I PROCEED. YES OF YOUR OPPOSITION AB THIRTY TWO SEVEN NINE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TANYA COLLECTOR IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THREE MAJOR CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH EIGHTY THREE TWO SEVEN NINE. FIRST THE BILL WOULD CREATE UNREASONABLY SHORT WHEN THEY CATION TIMELINE EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 1% OF PROJECT APPROVED FACE ANY CHALLENGE UNDER C. CLASS. RT HAS SHORT DEADLINE THE PROSECUTING A CASE. OKAY ALREADY RECEIVED PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN THE COURT. HE PUT CASES INVOLVE EXTENSIVE BRIEFING AFFECT TIGHT AFFECTATIONS FOR THE RECORD- AND THE JUDGES WANT TO HAVE- COPY THAT EVERY SINGLE PAGE- AT THE EVIDENCE THAT DANCE RELIED ON THE MINISTRY OF RECORD REDUCING THE SHORT TIME LINE FOR PRESENTING THE CASE TO A JUDGE WHAT I'M REGIONALLY RESTRICTED PETITIONERS. RIGHT COMPLETE JUDICIAL REVIEW. SECOND THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE PETITIONERS RIGHT TO COMPARE THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD BY SHIFTING PREPARATION TO THE AGENCY. THIS WOULD PREVENT PETITIONERS FROM HAVING ACCESS TO EVAN EARLY ON IN THE CASE. THAT INCREASE TO COVER THE RECORD AND HOMES INCREASED LITIGATION COSTS I WOULD PREVENT PETITIONERS FROM CONTROLLING LITIGATION **** WHICH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE EXISTING LAW. THIRD AND FINALLY THE BILL WOULD ALLOW TRAVELPORT ISSUE AN INTERLOCUTORY REMAND ORDER CONTEND THE PROJECT BACK TO THE AGENCY WITHOUT ISSUING A FINAL JUDGMENT. BECAUSE OF THE ONE FINAL JUDGMENT WILL THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE PROHIBITING. AT THAT AT THAT RULE IT PROHIBITS APPEALS FROM INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS AB THREE TWO SEVEN NINE WOULD PREVENT PETITIONERS EVER OBTAINING A FINAL JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO FILE AN APPEAL. BUT ALSO UNNECESSARY. ALREADY HAS A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES RIGHT GEN CLUED ONLY THOSE AFFECT MANDATE TWITTER NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLASS. EIGHTY THREE TWO SEVEN NINE WOULD CREATE UNNECESSARY BURDENS FOR LEAD AGAIN AND THE COURT MAY RESTRICT TO PROFITS RIGHT. EVEN THOUGH MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE BUT SEE QUITE AS A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT AND VEHICLE EDUCATION IF EXTREMELY RARE. WE URGE YOU TO VOTED NO ON EIGHTY THREE TWO SEVEN NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION BY PHONE. WE DO HAVE TO THAT CUED UP AND THE FIRST ONE IS FROM LINE TO SIXTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON VICE CHAIR THIS IS GRAND ALSO LOOK HERE COULD CALIFORNIA IN RESPECT WHAT THE DISH AND EIGHTY TWO THIRTY TWO SEVENTY NINE. A WE BELIEVE THAT COMPOSES ONEROUS ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAYING G. SOME PETITIONERS. DURING THE SEEK ON COASTAL PROCESS WHICH IS LOCATION- MY COLLEAGUE WITH YOUR P. WILL DISCUSS OTHER ASPECTS BUT ONE ASPECT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST GO TO THE ROUND THE ANALOG TO REMAND WHICH- NICHOLAS HERRING JUST COME TO FUND. AND THAT REMAINED PART PRO- REQUIREMENT WOULD ESSENTIALLY ALLOW FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO BRING A SUCCESSFUL SEQUEL CASE. PREVENT THE COURT TO ORDER THE KEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DOCKET WHILE THE CASE IS STILL PENDING AND THEN LOSE THAT CASE- PUTTING. HMM SOME FINAL JOE. WHICH SHOULD THEM TO A MAJOR APPEAL BUT ALSO CREEK THEM FROM. GETTING FEES. OBTAINING A THE TRAIN PEOPLE ON WELL SO PLEASE READ AND BE RESPECTED OF THE THIRTY SEVEN NINE.

SCENE NINE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR SIR RESURGENT THANK YOU. SO MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE TO YOUR- EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE SEAQUEST SPECIALLY TO HELP ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS- BUT- AS IS A FORMER LITIGATOR AYE- TO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY US BUT SEE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS ON YOU KNOW I THINK- AND AS YOU MAY WELL KNOW- THERE. YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS THE LAW AND THEN THERE'S THE REALITY IN WHICH LAWYERS WORKIN AND I'M CONCERNED THAT- THE COST SSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY- THE CENTER REYES POVERTY IN ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS SOME OTHER GROUPS. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS THAT THAT I THAT I SPOKE WITH- A CASE IN POINT I RECEIVED A EMAIL FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I THINK IT'S- A FAIR THAT I THAT THAT I SHARE THIS BUT- ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT ON RECORD IN OPPOSING THE BILL- THEY'RE RAISING THE ISSUE OF LAWSUIT GAMESMANSHIP WHERE- YOU KNOW OFTEN. DEVELOPERS CAN- CAN- SUPPRESSED ABILITY OF COMMUNITY GROUPS THE FILE SEQUEL LITIGATION BY- BY- YOU KNOW. PREVENTING PETITIONERS FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CUT DOWN ON THEIR EXPENSES TO FILE THESE PUBLIC INTEREST- LAWSUITS AND SO YOU KNOW WHILE I AYE TO RECOGNIZE IT AND I DO- BELIEVE THAT- THAT- IT THERE ARE. ABUSES OF CIVIL LITIGATION THAT THAT SOMEHOW NEED TO BE- CUT DOWN ON- YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL- MAY- PUT TO ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATE LITIGANTS AT A DISADVANTAGE. THE REST WERE SEARCHING ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING THAT YOU HAVE ONE OVER THE PHONE LINE FROM. I WILL GO TO MISTER MATHIS FIRST. THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A JOINT AUTHORED ON THIS BILL AS WELL AND LOVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND IT'S- ABOUT TIME WE START MOVING FORWARD. WITH THESE THINGS THANK. WE'LL GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES IF THEY JUST KEEP THERE COMMENTS QUICK. NAME ORGANIZATION SUPPORTER OPPOSITION PLEASE. SURE ABSOLUTELY IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WITH THE OPERATOR RIGHT NOW BUT THEY DID- DROPPED ONLINE SO PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED- WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ON THE BILL- MISTER MATHIS WILL HAVE HAPPILY I DO-AS AN AUTHOR- I WILL SAY THAT. IT'S NEVER BEEN HARD IT SEEMS FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS AND PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF MONEY TO GET A LOT OF SICK WITH STREAMLINING. AND WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO MAKE THE PROCESS EASIER. FOR THOSE ORDINARY PROJECTS RUN OF THE MILL HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE JUST GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. TO HELP THEM AS WELL- SICK WAS MAY NOT BE USED ALL OVER THE STATE ALL THE TIME BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN MY DISTRICT IN HOLLYWOOD. IT'S FREQUENTLY USED OR EVEN AGAINST VERY MODEST AND VERY. GOOD PROJECTS- AND THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO STOP PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO USE IT WAS A TOOL IT'S CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO. STOP THE COMMUNITY FROM UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF A PROJECT. WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF THE- LA CONSERVANCY'S A MODERN COMMITTEE. I WAS INVOLVED IN SEVERAL SEQUEL LAWSUITS ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION GROUND SO I VERY MUCH UNDERSTAND. SMALL SCRAPPY GROUPS TO SCRAPE TOGETHER THE MONEY TO FILE THE SEQUEL LAWSUIT. I'M NOT ATTEMPTING TO STOP THEM. I AM ATTEMPTING TO BRING FINALITY- TO THE PROCESS AND TO GET THESE ISSUES RESOLVED AS QUICKLY AND PAINLESSLY FOR EVERYONE AS POSSIBLE. WHICH IS WHY WE DO IN CRIME IN THIS TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE RESOLUTIONS TO BE BROUGHT AND- RATHER THAN STOPPING PROJECTS COLD TO ALLOW. THE IMPACT THE INPUT OF THE COMMUNITY TO BE WEIGHED. AND ACTED ON BY THE AGENCIES AND BY THE DEVELOPERS SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S HELPFUL TO ALL PARTIES. I WE DON'T THINK IT'S LETTER TO ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER BUT WE DO THINK THAT IT WILL HELP RESOLVE ISSUES- MORE QUICKLY. WE WILL COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS- AND THE SUPPORTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SOMETHING THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO MOVE THE NEEDLE- BUT ALSO DID NOT.
