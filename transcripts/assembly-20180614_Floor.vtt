WE FUNDED THE UC AND CSU SO THEY

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:09.572

02:54:38.801 --> 02:54:39.936
THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WHICH IS

02:54:40.002 --> 02:54:42.271
TOUCHED ALMOST EVERY CITY.

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.940
IN OUR STATE USED TO BE

02:54:44.006 --> 02:54:44.807
PRIMARILY URBAN PROBLEM

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:46.509
PRIMARILY SAN FRANCISCO.

LOS ANGELES PROBLEM NOW IS NOT

02:54:48.411 --> 02:54:50.112
UNUSUAL TO GOING TO MODESTO OR

02:54:50.179 --> 02:54:59.822
FRESNO OR EVEN SOME MORE THE

02:54:59.889 --> 02:55:00.423
HARDEST HIT RULE AREAS WERE

02:55:00.489 --> 02:55:01.057
RECEIVED PEOPLE ON THE STREETS.

02:55:01.123 --> 02:55:01.624
SO WE ARE DOING A HISTORIC

02:55:01.691 --> 02:55:02.258
INVESTMENT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:55:02.325 --> 02:55:02.825
DOLLARS WE ARE GIVING THE

02:55:02.892 --> 02:55:03.359
EMERGENCY MONEY FOR THIS

02:55:03.426 --> 02:55:04.060
EMERGENCY PROBLEM SO THAT CITIES

02:55:04.126 --> 02:55:05.528
COUNTIES COULD BUILD SHELTER.

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:07.129
GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS OUT

02:55:07.196 --> 02:55:08.965

WE ALSO KNOW THAT POVERTY IS A

02:55:11.934 --> 02:55:13.603
HUGE ISSUE IN OUR STATE WE HAVE

02:55:13.669 --> 02:55:14.804

AND DURING THE DOWNTURN THOSE

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:19.242
PROGRAMS WERE PROBABLY THE MOST

02:55:19.308 --> 02:55:20.443
SEVERELY CUT.

02:55:20.509 --> 02:55:21.978

03:09:19.047 --> 03:09:20.449
PRIORITY OF MINE SINCE MY

UNFORTUNATELY SINCE I'VE BEEN

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:26.021
HERE THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS

03:09:26.088 --> 03:09:28.256
BECAUSE HAVE BECOME LESS SAFE.

03:09:28.323 --> 03:09:30.392
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN CRASHES

03:09:30.459 --> 03:09:32.427
OF INCREASED 29%.

03:09:32.494 --> 03:09:33.495
AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS PER

03:09:33.562 --> 03:09:37.265
MILE DRIVEN HAS INCREASED 27%.

03:09:37.332 --> 03:09:39.034
THE STATISTICS FAR OUTPACED THE

03:09:39.101 --> 03:09:41.770
STATE'S POPULATION GROWTH OF 8%.

03:09:41.837 --> 03:09:42.871
AS WELL AS THE INCREASE HAVE

03:09:42.938 --> 03:09:44.005
BEEN LICENSED DRIVERS AND

03:09:44.072 --> 03:09:47.342
REGISTERED VEHICLES OF 11%.

03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:48.643
DECLINING SAFETY OF OUR HIGHWAYS

03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:50.245
IS DIRECTLY RELATED.

03:09:50.312 --> 03:09:53.982
TO THIS FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND

03:09:54.049 --> 03:09:55.217
TEN THE NUMBER OF HIGHWAY PATROL

03:09:55.283 --> 03:09:56.885

03:09:56.952 --> 03:09:59.654
ACTUALLY DECREASED BY 5% MATTER

03:09:59.721 --> 03:10:01.223
OF FACT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.

03:10:01.289 --> 03:10:02.858
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE HIGHWAY

03:10:02.924 --> 03:10:05.026
PATROL WAS CUT THREE HUNDRED

03:10:05.093 --> 03:10:08.697
POSITIONS AND NEVER RESTORE.

03:10:08.764 --> 03:10:10.465
LET ME REITERATE THIS POINT.

03:10:10.532 --> 03:10:12.467
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION NUMBER

03:10:12.534 --> 03:10:13.401
OF REGISTER VEHICLES AND

03:10:13.468 --> 03:10:15.537

03:10:19.274 --> 03:10:21.276
FEWER.

03:10:21.343 --> 03:10:22.711
THE RESULT OF THESE DIVERGENT

03:10:22.778 --> 03:10:24.112
TRENDS ARE CLEAR.

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.447
MORE ACCIDENTS AND AN INCREASED

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:26.548
FATALITY RATE.

03:10:26.615 --> 03:10:30.085
MORE PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY.

03:10:30.152 --> 03:10:31.586
IT'S TIME FOR OUR STATE TO TAKE

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.255
ACTION TO REVERSE THIS TREND AND

03:10:33.321 --> 03:10:34.856
WE PROBABLY FUND THE OFFICERS WE

03:10:34.923 --> 03:10:36.391

03:10:36.458 --> 03:10:39.327
CALIFORNIANS CAN TRAVEL SAFELY.

03:10:39.394 --> 03:10:40.462
THIS IS WHY I HAVE ASKED FOR

BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE

03:10:44.232 --> 03:10:45.133
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T BELIEVE

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:46.601
THIS IS A PRIORITY THEREFORE WE

03:10:46.668 --> 03:10:48.970

STATE WITH FOUR HUNDRED MORE

03:11:33.315 --> 03:11:34.983

03:12:29.604 --> 03:12:30.839
WELL THERE ARE MANY THINGS I CAN

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:32.073
SAY GOOD ABOUT THIS BUDGET I

03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:33.508
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSCORE

03:12:33.575 --> 03:12:34.709
THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS

03:12:34.776 --> 03:12:36.311
BUDGET FAILS TO RETURN MORE

03:12:36.378 --> 03:12:37.679
DOLLARS TO THE HARD WORKING

03:12:37.746 --> 03:12:39.547
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS.

03:12:39.614 --> 03:12:41.149
EVEN AS WE SEE THIS NINE BILLION

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:42.951
DOLLAR SURPLUS.

03:12:43.018 --> 03:12:43.985
IN I WANT TO AFFIRM THE POINT

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:45.186
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MY

03:12:45.253 --> 03:12:47.055
COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE.

03:12:47.122 --> 03:12:47.989
THAT WITH FUNDS IN THE STATE'S

03:12:48.056 --> 03:12:50.258
EMERGENCY ACCOUNT TOTALING MORE

03:12:50.325 --> 03:12:51.760
THAN 4% OF GENERAL REVENUE.

03:12:51.826 --> 03:12:53.695
A QUARTER CENT SALES TAX SHOULD

03:12:53.762 --> 03:12:55.497
BE TRIGGERED AUTOMATICALLY.

03:12:55.563 --> 03:12:56.431
IS DUE TO LAWS THAT WERE

03:12:56.498 --> 03:12:58.300
SUPPOSED TO KEEP STATE LAWMAKERS

03:12:58.366 --> 03:13:00.368
FROM HARDING FUNDS YET GOVERNOR

03:13:00.435 --> 03:13:01.469
BROWN LEGISLATIVE DEMOCRATS OF

03:13:01.536 --> 03:13:03.004

IN THEIR ACCOUNTING PRACTICES TO

03:13:04.606 --> 03:13:06.641
CREATE NEW SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT

03:13:06.708 --> 03:13:08.476
WOULD BYPASS THE EXPECTED SALES

03:13:08.543 --> 03:13:09.844
TAX CUT AND I THINK THIS IS

03:13:09.911 --> 03:13:11.313
WRONG NO MATTER HOW HOW ABOUT

03:13:11.379 --> 03:13:12.647

03:13:12.714 --> 03:13:14.482
ADDITIONALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF

03:13:41.376 --> 03:13:42.844
PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

03:13:42.911 --> 03:13:44.546
THIS STATE IS TO ALLOW

03:13:44.612 --> 03:13:46.481
CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO KEEP

03:13:46.548 --> 03:13:47.949

HELP COUNTIES.

03:22:03.377 --> 03:22:05.112
IT ALSO POSTS AN ADDITIONAL ONE

03:22:05.179 --> 03:22:06.347
DOLLAR TRANSACTION FEE TO RECOUP

03:22:06.414 --> 03:22:07.915

BUT THAT I ASCRIBE.

03:22:14.822 --> 03:22:15.790
MR OBERNOLTE YOUR RECOGNIZE

03:22:15.857 --> 03:22:17.325
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS

03:22:17.391 --> 03:22:19.527
BILL ALLOWS CITIES AND COUNTIES

03:22:19.594 --> 03:22:22.230
TO BORROW AGAINST THE REVENUE.

03:22:22.296 --> 03:22:23.798
FROM THE GAS TAX INCREASE THAT

03:22:23.865 --> 03:22:25.099
WAS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE

03:22:25.166 --> 03:22:26.601
LAST YEAR.

03:22:26.667 --> 03:22:28.603
GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS HIGHLY

03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:30.204
LIKELY THAT VOTERS WILL BE

03:22:30.271 --> 03:22:32.507
CONSIDERING A REPEAL OF THIS GAS

03:22:32.573 --> 03:22:33.875
TAX INCREASE ON THE BALLOT THIS

03:22:33.941 --> 03:22:34.976
NOVEMBER.

03:22:35.042 --> 03:22:37.078
IT SEEMS VERY UNWISE TO ALLOW

03:22:37.144 --> 03:22:39.347
LOCAL AGENCIES TO BORROW AGAINST

03:22:39.413 --> 03:22:42.450
REVENUE WHICH MAY NOT BE THERE.

03:22:42.517 --> 03:22:44.018
ANOTHER THING THAT THIS TRAILER

03:22:44.085 --> 03:22:45.887
BILL DOES IS IT IMPOSES AN

03:22:45.953 --> 03:22:47.121
ADDITIONAL ONE DOLLAR PER

03:22:47.188 --> 03:22:48.823
TRANSACTION TAX.

03:22:48.890 --> 03:22:50.458
ON PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT

03:22:50.525 --> 03:22:52.193
CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:22:52.260 --> 03:22:53.427
MOTOR VEHICLES TO PROCESS

03:22:53.494 --> 03:22:54.695
VEHICLE REGISTRATION AND TITLE

03:22:54.762 --> 03:22:56.264
CHANGES.

03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:58.766
THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES SEEK TO

03:22:58.833 --> 03:23:00.234
PROCESS THESE TRANSACTIONS

03:23:00.301 --> 03:23:02.069
OUTSIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:03.804
MOTOR VEHICLE FIELD OFFICES AND

03:23:03.871 --> 03:23:05.373
THEREFORE THEY REDUCE LINES AND

03:23:05.439 --> 03:23:07.041
WAIT TIMES WITHIN THOSE FIELD

03:23:07.108 --> 03:23:10.978
OFFICES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

03:23:11.045 --> 03:23:11.479
WE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN

03:23:11.546 --> 03:23:11.879
STRUGGLING WITH.

03:23:11.946 --> 03:23:12.713
RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT IF

03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:14.148
YOU WANT MORE OF SOMETHING YOU

03:23:14.215 --> 03:23:15.383
SHOULD SUBSIDIZE IT AND IF YOU

03:23:15.449 --> 03:23:16.484
WANT LESS OF SOMETHING YOU

03:23:16.551 --> 03:23:17.618
SHOULD TAXES.

03:23:17.685 --> 03:23:18.853
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS

03:23:18.920 --> 03:23:20.254
SOMETHING THAT WE WANT MORE OF

03:23:20.321 --> 03:23:22.223
SO WE SHOULD BE SUBSIDIZING IT

03:23:22.290 --> 03:23:22.790
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE

03:23:22.857 --> 03:23:23.558
TAXING IT.

03:23:23.624 --> 03:23:28.629
ARGENEAU VOTE.

03:23:28.696 --> 03:23:30.932

03:23:42.043 --> 03:23:44.078
FROM OAKLEY.

03:23:44.145 --> 03:23:46.414
INDICATED THE THE ABSENCE OF ANY

03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:47.381
SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA

THAT TO AND THEY CONTINUALLY

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:54.755
HAVE TO SUPPORT.

03:23:54.822 --> 03:23:56.958
AND IT PUTS A A SIGNIFICANT.

03:23:57.024 --> 03:23:57.959

PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SO

03:24:05.399 --> 03:24:06.601
UNFORTUNATELY IT DOES NOT

03:24:06.667 --> 03:24:07.602
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VERY

03:24:07.668 --> 03:24:09.170

INTO DEBT TO BORROW AGAINST

03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:48.843
FUTURE FUNDING? FOR FINDING THAT

03:24:48.909 --> 03:24:51.078
MAY NOT EXIST.

03:24:51.145 --> 03:24:53.381
IF THERE'S REPEAL OF THE GAS TAX

03:24:53.447 --> 03:24:54.815

THE BAG.

03:24:58.019 --> 03:24:59.520
BECAUSE THEY BORROWED AGAINST

THIS CHAMBER WOULD DISPUTE.

03:30:20.941 --> 03:30:23.277

03:30:23.344 --> 03:30:24.878
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES

WE SPEND MORE MONEY.

03:30:35.522 --> 03:30:37.424
ON THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S

03:30:37.491 --> 03:30:39.326
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO TAKE.

03:30:39.393 --> 03:30:40.627
SOMETIME AND DO SOME

03:30:40.694 --> 03:30:43.330

THAT WE SPEND ON THIS PROBLEM.

03:30:48.902 --> 03:30:51.305
THE ISSUE CONTINUES TO WORSEN IN

03:30:51.372 --> 03:30:52.973
FACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW

03:30:53.040 --> 03:30:54.541
HAS THE WORST HOMELESSNESS.

03:30:54.608 --> 03:30:58.479
OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY 25%.

03:30:58.545 --> 03:31:00.180
OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF

THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.

03:31:02.449 --> 03:31:05.085
IS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:31:05.152 --> 03:31:07.788
SO I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER.

03:31:07.855 --> 03:31:09.256
THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE TAKING

03:31:09.323 --> 03:31:10.624
TO FIGHTING THIS PROBLEM ANY

03:31:10.691 --> 03:31:11.992
PARTICULAR CONSIDER WHETHER OR

03:31:12.059 --> 03:31:13.694
NOT WE ARE TREATING THE SYMPTOM

03:31:13.761 --> 03:31:15.129
OF HOMELESSNESS.

03:31:15.195 --> 03:31:15.596
OR THE ROOT CAUSES OF

03:31:15.662 --> 03:31:17.231
HOMELESSNESS.

03:31:17.297 --> 03:31:18.799
I'M REMINDED OF A SITUATION

03:31:18.866 --> 03:31:20.701
WHERE A PATIENT GOES TO SEE A

03:31:20.768 --> 03:31:22.002
DOCTOR HE SAYS DOCTOR I HAVE A

03:31:22.069 --> 03:31:22.903
HEADACHE.

03:31:22.970 --> 03:31:23.904
AND THE DOCTOR DIAGNOSES BRAIN

03:31:23.971 --> 03:31:25.639
CANCER.

03:31:25.706 --> 03:31:26.874
SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THE DIAG THE

03:31:26.940 --> 03:31:28.375
DOCTOR TO TREAT THE CANCER YOU

03:31:28.442 --> 03:31:29.777
WOULD NOT EXPECT THE DOCTOR TO

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:31.111
TELL THE PATIENT TAKE TWO

03:31:31.178 --> 03:31:33.080
ASPIRIN THAT'LL FIX THE PROBLEM.

03:31:33.147 --> 03:31:34.815
AND I FEEL.

03:31:34.882 --> 03:31:36.083
THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION WITH

03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:37.451
HOMELESSNESS WITH THIS BILL WE

03:31:37.518 --> 03:31:38.819

03:31:38.886 --> 03:31:40.287
HOMELESSNESS THE FACT THAT

03:31:40.354 --> 03:31:42.089
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HOMES.

03:31:42.156 --> 03:31:43.457
WERE WE NEED TO PAY MORE

03:31:43.524 --> 03:31:44.525
ATTENTION TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF

03:31:44.591 --> 03:31:46.293
HOMELESSNESS.

03:31:46.360 --> 03:31:47.961
THESE ROOT CAUSES ARE VERY

03:31:48.028 --> 03:31:49.363
DIFFICULT TO SOLVE ADMITTEDLY

03:31:49.430 --> 03:31:50.798
BUT THEY ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD

03:31:50.864 --> 03:31:51.498
THEIR THINGS LIKE SUBSTANCE

03:31:51.565 --> 03:31:53.233
ABUSE [inaudible]

AGING ISSUES AND LACK OF ACCESS

03:31:59.339 --> 03:32:00.574
TO HEALTH CARE AND LET US NOT

03:32:00.641 --> 03:32:02.142
FORGET THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING

03:32:02.209 --> 03:32:05.379
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:32:05.446 --> 03:32:07.915

TREATING THE THE SYMPTOM OF THE

03:32:10.417 --> 03:32:11.351
PROBLEM I THINK WE SHOULD

03:32:11.418 --> 03:32:12.853
PAPER PUT MORE ATTENTION TO

03:32:12.920 --> 03:32:14.354

03:34:59.019 --> 03:34:59.753
THE ANSWER.

03:34:59.820 --> 03:35:01.989
IS NOT ALWAYS THROW MORE MONEY

03:35:02.055 --> 03:35:04.558

03:35:04.625 --> 03:35:04.858
[inaudible]

03:35:04.925 --> 03:35:08.195

GET THE HOMELESS POPULATION OUT

03:35:10.163 --> 03:35:11.798
OF SIGHT OF PEOPLE SO THAT THEY

03:35:11.865 --> 03:35:13.700
FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

03:35:13.767 --> 03:35:16.036

03:35:17.838 --> 03:35:18.872
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THE IT

03:35:18.939 --> 03:35:20.140
BUT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS

03:35:20.207 --> 03:35:20.907
BRINGING FORWARD.

03:35:20.974 --> 03:35:22.843
IS MONEY.

03:35:22.909 --> 03:35:24.211
TEMPORARY HOUSING TEMPERATE WHAT

03:35:24.278 --> 03:35:26.146

03:35:26.213 --> 03:35:26.713
PEOPLE TO BE HOMELESS IN THE

03:35:26.780 --> 03:35:28.348
FIRST PLACE.

03:35:28.415 --> 03:35:29.283
WHAT ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF

03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:31.018
LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WHAT ABOUT

03:35:31.084 --> 03:35:32.886
THE HIGH COST OF ELECTRICITY OF

03:35:32.953 --> 03:35:35.122
WATER OF GAS OF RENTING A HOME

03:35:35.188 --> 03:35:36.990
OF BUYING A HOME?

03:35:37.057 --> 03:35:38.892
EVERYTHING IN CALIFORNIA IS

03:35:38.959 --> 03:35:39.660
EXPENSIVE AND HAS GOTTEN MORE

03:35:39.726 --> 03:35:41.595
EXPENSIVE.

03:35:41.662 --> 03:35:42.863
THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAVE

03:35:42.929 --> 03:35:44.665
MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS BUT

03:35:44.731 --> 03:35:45.966
THERE'S NO SOLUTION ON THIS

03:35:46.033 --> 03:35:48.302
FLOOR TO TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT

03:35:48.368 --> 03:35:49.970
THOSE ISSUES IT'S JUST LET'S

03:35:50.037 --> 03:35:51.471
JUST TAKE MORE TAXPAYER MONEY.

03:35:52.739 --> 03:35:53.907
THIS PROBLEM.

03:35:53.974 --> 03:35:55.008
PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO IT

03:35:55.075 --> 03:35:56.076

03:35:56.143 --> 03:35:58.245
ENTIRELY SO I'M ASKING YOU AT

03:35:58.312 --> 03:36:00.080

THAT THE FUNDING IS PRIMARILY

03:36:41.221 --> 03:36:42.589

03:37:13.387 --> 03:37:14.888
OF THIS LEGISLATURE ACTED IN

03:37:14.955 --> 03:37:16.390

THAT THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

03:37:19.559 --> 03:37:21.228

03:37:26.867 --> 03:37:28.135
PART OF THE SOLUTION MENTAL

03:37:28.201 --> 03:37:29.269
HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH IS

03:37:29.336 --> 03:37:30.904
ABSOLUTELY A KEY COMPONENT WE

03:37:30.971 --> 03:37:31.805
HAVE --

03:37:31.872 --> 03:37:33.607
PARTS IN TRAILER BILLS AS WELL

03:37:33.673 --> 03:37:35.108
AS IN THE BUDGET WHERE WE ARE

03:37:35.175 --> 03:37:36.676
GRAPPLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:38.178
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE DEFTLY

03:37:38.245 --> 03:37:39.980
DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO

03:37:40.046 --> 03:37:42.382
AND WE SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION.

03:37:42.449 --> 03:37:43.683
TO WITH SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

03:37:43.750 --> 03:37:45.786
VERY ACUTELY AWARE IS AN ISSUE

03:37:45.852 --> 03:37:47.454

THESE OTHER AREAS.

03:38:12.512 --> 03:38:14.414
AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE DID IS WE

03:38:14.481 --> 03:38:15.782

TEAMS TING MISTER OBERNOLTE

04:01:06.785 --> 04:01:08.053
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK

04:01:08.120 --> 04:01:09.454
EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD

04:01:09.521 --> 04:01:11.123
AGREE THAT THE CAPITAL AND ACTS

04:01:14.960 --> 04:01:16.762
HOWEVER I FIND IT VERY TROUBLING

04:01:16.829 --> 04:01:18.697
THAT THIS TRAILER BILL EXAMS THE

04:01:18.764 --> 04:01:21.533
ENTIRE CAPITAL ANNEX PROJECT.

04:01:21.600 --> 04:01:22.734

04:01:26.638 --> 04:01:29.208
I FIND IT EXTREMELY HYPOCRITICAL.

04:01:29.274 --> 04:01:31.176
THAT WE TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

04:01:31.243 --> 04:01:33.111
THAT THEY MUST COMPLY WITH THE

04:01:33.178 --> 04:01:33.879

FROM OUR OWN LARGEST PROJECT

04:01:39.585 --> 04:01:41.720

WE CAN AFFORD A BRAND NEW

04:03:36.702 --> 04:03:37.970
CAPITOL BUILDING.

04:03:38.036 --> 04:03:39.705
WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE AS IT DID

04:03:39.771 --> 04:03:41.373
EARLIER THIS YEAR SAYS THAT

04:03:41.440 --> 04:03:42.975
LIMITED TAX CREDITS WOULD ENSURE

04:03:43.041 --> 04:03:45.377

04:04:02.427 --> 04:04:04.062
WHEN WE ROUTINELY LOOK AT THE

04:04:10.802 --> 04:04:12.304

THAT BUT BUT MEMBERS WE SHOULD

04:04:37.095 --> 04:04:39.564

AND I THINK.

04:05:04.222 --> 04:05:05.524
THERE'S CERTAINLY AN ARGUMENT TO

04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:07.325

OR I GUESS IF YOU'RE RENOVATING

04:05:15.901 --> 04:05:17.569

04:05:22.307 --> 04:05:26.511
HAVE.

04:05:26.578 --> 04:05:28.513
BILL BECAUSE SEQUEL ALLOWS

04:05:28.580 --> 04:05:29.448
PEOPLE TO GO IN AND SHUT THE

04:05:29.514 --> 04:05:31.316

FIRST DAY THEY ANNOUNCE IT.

04:05:32.951 --> 04:05:34.052
THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO

04:05:34.119 --> 04:05:37.322
EXEMPT ITSELF FROM THE SAME LIES

ACCOUNT I'VE MAKES A LOT OF

04:19:35.593 --> 04:19:37.094
THINGS DURING THIS TIME.

BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY

04:19:50.608 --> 04:19:52.176
PREDEFINED TRANSFER.

04:19:52.243 --> 04:19:53.110
IF THE ACTUAL AMOUNT NEEDED TO

04:19:53.177 --> 04:19:55.780
FILL THE BRAIN DEFINED AS ONE

04:19:55.846 --> 04:19:56.881
SEVEN BILLION THIS FUND RETAIN

HALF THE BALANCE THE OTHER HALF

04:19:58.215 --> 04:20:00.384
GOES TO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE.

04:20:00.451 --> 04:20:01.786
FINANCE THE LA ON THE

04:20:01.852 --> 04:20:02.887
LEGISLATURE WORK ON THE RULES

04:20:02.954 --> 04:20:04.322
FOR THE DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

04:20:04.388 --> 04:20:05.523
FOR BOTH RESERVES.

04:20:05.589 --> 04:20:07.892
OVER THE NEXT YEAR WITH THAT I

04:20:07.959 --> 04:20:10.094
RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

04:20:10.161 --> 04:20:11.329
THANK YOU TING MEASURE OBERNOLTE

04:20:11.395 --> 04:20:12.930
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

04:20:12.997 --> 04:20:15.333
THIS TRAILER BILL CREATES TWO

04:20:15.399 --> 04:20:17.768
NEW BUDGET SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

04:20:17.835 --> 04:20:19.904
THE STATE ALREADY HAS TO SAVINGS

04:20:19.971 --> 04:20:22.340
ACCOUNTS ONE THE BUDGET SAVINGS

04:20:22.406 --> 04:20:24.108
ACCOUNT THE BSA WILL BE FULLY

04:20:24.175 --> 04:20:25.676
FUNDED THIS YEAR.

04:20:25.743 --> 04:20:27.478
THAT ACCOUNT HAS A MAXIMUM

04:20:27.545 --> 04:20:29.046
BALANCE OF 10% OF GENERAL FUND

04:20:29.113 --> 04:20:31.048
REVENUES.

04:20:31.115 --> 04:20:31.849
THE OTHER ACCOUNT THAT WE

04:20:31.916 --> 04:20:33.551
ALREADY HAVE IS A SPECIAL FUND

04:20:33.617 --> 04:20:35.119
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES WHICH

04:20:35.186 --> 04:20:37.555
DOES NOT HAVE A MAXIMUM CAP.

04:20:37.621 --> 04:20:39.357
HOWEVER STATE LAW DOES SAY THAT

04:20:39.423 --> 04:20:41.025
WHEN THE BALANCE OF THAT SAVINGS

04:20:41.092 --> 04:20:43.461
ACCOUNT EXCEEDS 4% OF GENERAL

04:20:43.527 --> 04:20:44.562
FUND REVENUES.

04:20:44.628 --> 04:20:46.297
THAT WILL TRIGGER AN AUTOMATIC

04:20:46.364 --> 04:20:48.432
ONE QUARTER PERCENT REDUCTION IN

04:20:48.499 --> 04:20:50.534
THE STATE SALES TAX RATE.

04:20:50.601 --> 04:20:53.104
SO THE ONLY REASON FOR CREATING

04:20:53.170 --> 04:20:55.339
NEW TYPES OF RESERVE ACCOUNTS.

04:20:55.406 --> 04:20:57.208
IS TO AVOID GIVING THE PEOPLE OF

04:20:57.274 --> 04:20:59.377
CALIFORNIA A SMALL BREAK ON

04:20:59.443 --> 04:21:01.679
THEIR SALES TAX RATE.

04:21:01.746 --> 04:21:03.447
I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE ANY

04:21:03.514 --> 04:21:05.483
YEAR THAT WE HAVE A NINE BILLION

04:21:05.549 --> 04:21:06.984
DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THAT WERE

04:21:07.051 --> 04:21:08.386
SEEKING TO AVOID THE

04:21:08.452 --> 04:21:09.653
RESPONSIBILITY.

04:21:09.720 --> 04:21:11.355
OF LOWERING THE STATE SALES TAX

04:21:11.422 --> 04:21:12.189
RATE.

04:21:12.256 --> 04:21:14.058
EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT.

04:21:14.125 --> 04:21:15.926
EVEN NO THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

04:21:15.993 --> 04:21:20.731
LAW REQUIRES ORIGINAL VOTE.

04:21:20.798 --> 04:21:22.400

COME.

04:21:28.239 --> 04:21:29.473
ADDING THE BUDGET DEFICIT

04:21:29.540 --> 04:21:30.775

04:21:35.212 --> 04:21:37.848
RESERVE WILL HELP ENSURE WE ARE

04:21:37.915 --> 04:21:49.894
NOT FORCED TO MAKE SEVERE CUTS

04:21:49.960 --> 04:21:50.528
TO EDUCATION AND OTHER IMPORTANT

04:21:50.594 --> 04:21:51.195
PROGRAMS IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC

04:21:51.262 --> 04:21:51.729
DOWNTURN IN COMING YEARS.

04:21:51.796 --> 04:21:52.430
EVERY DOLLAR WE HOLDEN RESERVES

04:21:52.496 --> 04:21:53.030
WILL BE PRECIOUS IF AND WHEN

04:21:53.097 --> 04:21:53.397
THERE'S A NEED.

04:21:53.464 --> 04:21:53.931

TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IF WE HAVE

04:22:28.966 --> 04:22:30.568
THIS KIND OF MONEY IF THE STATE

04:22:30.634 --> 04:22:32.002
LAW SAYS WE SHOULD BE REFINING

04:22:32.069 --> 04:22:33.904

EVEN INSUFFICIENT NOW TO SEE US

04:23:43.674 --> 04:23:44.275
THROUGH.

04:23:44.341 --> 04:23:45.943
THIS MEASURE PUTS US ON A PATH

04:23:46.010 --> 04:23:48.012
TO CONTINUE TO SAVE MONEY SO WE

04:23:48.078 --> 04:23:49.213

WHAT WAS SO DEVASTATING AND THE

04:23:56.220 --> 04:23:57.454
CUTS THE REQUIRED CHOICES

04:23:57.521 --> 04:24:00.424

SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTHCARE

04:24:01.959 --> 04:24:03.527
THIS ACCOUNT WILL HELP US AVOID

04:24:03.594 --> 04:24:04.962

04:24:05.029 --> 04:24:06.997
SEVERE CUTS AGAIN AND SO FOR

04:24:07.064 --> 04:24:08.732

MENTIONED THERE IS NO NEED TO

04:24:20.611 --> 04:24:22.446
CREATE THIS FINE WE ALREADY HAVE

04:24:22.513 --> 04:24:23.514
SAVINGS ACCOUNT WE HAVE A RAINY

04:24:23.581 --> 04:24:25.216
DAY ACCOUNT.

04:24:25.282 --> 04:24:26.517
AND WHAT THIS DOES BECAUSE

04:24:26.584 --> 04:24:28.385
THERE'S NO CAP.

04:24:28.452 --> 04:24:29.620
THAT IS PUT INTO PLACE FOR THESE

04:24:29.687 --> 04:24:31.922
FUNDS IT MEANS AT NO TIME IN THE

04:24:31.989 --> 04:24:33.757
FUTURE WILL THIS LEGISLATURE

04:24:33.824 --> 04:24:35.526
EVER HAVE TO GIVE MONEY BACK TO

04:24:35.593 --> 04:24:37.661
THE TAXPAYERS.

04:24:37.728 --> 04:24:39.296
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAP SO WEEK

04:24:39.363 --> 04:24:40.931
IS WHAT SAYING YOU KNOW THE

04:24:40.998 --> 04:24:42.633
YEARS CONTINUE WHERE WE HAVE.

04:24:42.700 --> 04:24:44.001
MORE OF A SURPLUS THAT WE DO

04:24:44.068 --> 04:24:45.536
EVEN THIS YEAR.

04:24:45.603 --> 04:24:46.904
SOCKET ALL THE WAY INTO ONE OF

04:24:46.971 --> 04:24:48.038
THESE FUNDS AND NEVER GIVEN BACK

04:24:48.105 --> 04:24:49.707
TO THE TAXPAYERS AND THERE'S

04:24:49.773 --> 04:24:51.842
SOMETHING ELSE WE HAVE.

04:24:51.909 --> 04:24:54.345
SOME MENTION MADE OF OF PAINFUL

04:24:54.411 --> 04:24:58.382
CUTS IN DURING PAINFUL CUTS --

04:24:58.449 --> 04:25:01.485
LOOK AT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

04:25:01.552 --> 04:25:03.020
RIGHT NOW WHO ARE MAKING SOME

04:25:03.087 --> 04:25:03.921
REAL PAINFUL CUTS IN THEIR

04:25:03.988 --> 04:25:06.557
FAMILIES.

THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME

04:25:07.791 --> 04:25:09.093
PAYING THEIR BILLS AND I THINK

04:25:09.159 --> 04:25:11.428
THEY WOULD LOVE. TO HAVE THEIR

04:25:11.495 --> 04:25:12.930
GOVERNMENT TO GIVE THEM BACK

04:25:12.997 --> 04:25:15.399
SOME OF THE MONEY THAT IS FAIRS

04:25:15.466 --> 04:25:17.568
IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS WHY

04:25:17.635 --> 04:25:20.137
WE HAVE IT IT IS NOT OUR MONEY

04:25:20.204 --> 04:25:21.939
IT'S THE TAXPAYERS MONEY.

04:25:22.006 --> 04:25:23.841
AND RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT

04:25:23.907 --> 04:25:25.242
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR STATE

04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:26.677
WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE

04:25:26.744 --> 04:25:28.345
HOMELESS ISSUE WE TALKED AD

NAUSEUM.

04:25:29.813 --> 04:25:31.682
ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS.

04:25:31.749 --> 04:25:32.916
ABOUT THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE

04:25:32.983 --> 04:25:34.018
TO FIND A PLACE TO RENT THAT'S

04:25:34.084 --> 04:25:36.720
AFFORDABLE.

04:25:36.787 --> 04:25:38.622
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO ASK

04:25:38.689 --> 04:25:40.424
THE GOVERNMENT FOR HELP IN

04:25:40.491 --> 04:25:41.992
PAYING THEIR ELECTRICITY BILL

04:25:42.059 --> 04:25:43.794
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO APPLY

04:25:43.861 --> 04:25:45.062
FOR HELP TO THE GOVERNMENT.

04:25:45.129 --> 04:25:45.896
IN ORDER TO PUT FOOD ON THE

04:25:45.963 --> 04:25:47.498

THIS LEGISLATURE TO GIVE THE

04:26:16.794 --> 04:26:18.696

04:26:29.773 --> 04:26:31.175
IN MY DISTRICT I KNOW.

04:26:31.241 --> 04:26:33.077
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AND

04:26:33.143 --> 04:26:34.411
THEY'RE GOING TO IDAHO LIMON

04:26:34.478 --> 04:26:36.780
ARIZONA THEY'RE GOING TO TEXAS

04:26:36.847 --> 04:26:39.450
AND OTHER PLACES ON SOME.

04:26:39.516 --> 04:26:41.652
REALLY HOT AND DRY PLACE HIS

04:26:41.719 --> 04:26:43.554
THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE GOING

04:26:43.620 --> 04:26:45.456
TO JUST TO ESCAPE THE HIGH COST

04:26:45.522 --> 04:26:47.091
OF LIVING IN THE STATE.

04:26:47.157 --> 04:26:48.959
OF THE FACT THAT WE GOT SUCH A

04:26:49.026 --> 04:26:51.061
BIG SURPLUS CLEARLY INDICATES

04:26:51.128 --> 04:26:53.030
THAT WE TOOK IN FAR MORE MONEY

04:26:53.097 --> 04:26:55.799
THAN WE NEED OR ARE USING.

04:26:55.866 --> 04:26:57.735
AND WE WANNA FUND A LITTLE WAY

04:26:57.801 --> 04:27:00.037
INTO THESE ACCOUNTS THAT IN A

04:27:00.104 --> 04:27:02.806
WAY WHETHER THE INTENT WAS NOT

04:27:02.873 --> 04:27:03.974
TO CIRCUMVENT.

04:27:04.041 --> 04:27:05.342
ACTUALLY REDUCING THE STATE

04:27:05.409 --> 04:27:07.678
SALES TAX BY A QUARTER PERCENT.

04:27:07.745 --> 04:27:10.013
AND THAT'S PART OF OUR LAWS SO I

04:27:10.080 --> 04:27:10.981
THINK ARE HARD WORKING

04:27:11.048 --> 04:27:13.751
CALIFORNIANS ARE BETTER ABLE.

04:27:13.817 --> 04:27:15.252
THAN BETTER KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT

04:27:15.319 --> 04:27:17.321
HOW TO USE THEIR OWN MONEY AND I

04:27:17.388 --> 04:27:17.921
WOULD --

04:27:17.988 --> 04:27:19.590
ENCOURAGE SENDING IT BACK TO

04:27:19.656 --> 04:27:20.958
THEM RATHER THAN THE STATE

04:27:21.024 --> 04:27:22.192
FUNNELING AWAY I URGE IN THE

04:27:22.259 --> 04:27:26.263

WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR.

04:27:35.706 --> 04:27:37.374
AND THE ARGUMENT PUT FORTH --

04:27:37.441 --> 04:27:39.109
THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON. TO

04:27:39.176 --> 04:27:40.511
INCLUDE THIS ADDITIONAL SAVINGS

04:27:40.577 --> 04:27:43.814
ON THE BUDGET.

04:27:43.881 --> 04:27:44.381
THERE IS THE NEW DEMOCRATIC

04:27:44.448 --> 04:27:46.750
CAUCUS PUT FORTH PROPOSALS

04:27:46.817 --> 04:27:47.284
CREATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS

04:27:47.351 --> 04:27:48.452
ACCOUNT.

04:27:48.519 --> 04:27:50.220
AND THE PURPOSE [inaudible] FOR

04:27:50.287 --> 04:27:53.056
THAT WAS IT OVER THE PAST THIRTY

04:27:53.123 --> 04:27:54.892
YEARS WE'VE AVERAGED ONE

04:27:54.958 --> 04:27:57.294
ECONOMIC RECESSION PER DECADE.

04:27:57.361 --> 04:27:58.762
WE HAD A RECESSION THE EARLY

04:27:58.829 --> 04:28:00.264
NINETEEN NINETIES WE HAD THE DOT

04:28:00.330 --> 04:28:01.932
COM BUST NEARLY TWO THOUSANDS.

04:28:01.999 --> 04:28:03.267
MORE RECENTLY WE ALL EXPERIENCE

04:28:03.333 --> 04:28:05.569
THE GREAT RECESSION.

04:28:05.636 --> 04:28:07.438
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THIS BODY

04:28:07.504 --> 04:28:09.139
WAS MORE THAN THREE MONTHS LATE

04:28:09.206 --> 04:28:10.140
IN DELIVERING A BUDGET TO THE

04:28:10.207 --> 04:28:10.707
GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF FUNDING

04:28:10.774 --> 04:28:13.110
SHORTFALLS.

04:28:13.177 --> 04:28:15.345
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE STATE

04:28:15.412 --> 04:28:16.647
WAS LATE PAYING ITS OWN BILLS

04:28:16.713 --> 04:28:18.048
BECAUSE OF A THREE AND A HALF

04:28:18.115 --> 04:28:19.917
BILLION DOLLAR CASH FLOW PROBLEM.

04:28:19.983 --> 04:28:21.718
THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE DRASTIC

04:28:21.785 --> 04:28:23.654
CUTS TO EDUCATION HEALTH CARE

04:28:23.720 --> 04:28:26.557
SERVICES AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

04:28:26.623 --> 04:28:28.058
THE STATE'S NONPARTISAN

04:28:28.125 --> 04:28:30.294
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S INDICATED

04:28:30.360 --> 04:28:31.829
EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT

04:28:31.895 --> 04:28:33.630
CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED A RESERVE.

04:28:33.697 --> 04:28:35.232
AND AS MUCH AS TWENTY BILLION TO

04:28:35.299 --> 04:28:36.467
PREVENT DRASTIC CUTS DURING A

04:28:36.533 --> 04:28:38.268
MILD RECESSION.

04:28:38.335 --> 04:28:39.736
AND FORTY BILLION FOR SOMETHING

04:28:39.803 --> 04:28:42.372
MORE SEVERE.

04:28:42.439 --> 04:28:43.907
THE PROPOSED FULLY FUNDED RAINY

04:28:43.974 --> 04:28:45.742
DAY FUND IS JUST OVER HALF OF

04:28:45.809 --> 04:28:47.311
WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED. TO

04:28:47.377 --> 04:28:49.880
GET THROUGH A MILD RECESSION.

04:28:49.947 --> 04:28:51.215
SO EVEN TODAY MEMBERS WERE NOT

04:28:51.281 --> 04:28:53.350
SOLVING THE ENTIRE PROBLEM BUT

04:28:53.417 --> 04:28:55.185
THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP CLOSE

04:28:55.252 --> 04:28:55.385
THAT.

04:28:55.452 --> 04:28:57.287
SAVINGS GAP.

04:28:57.354 --> 04:28:57.955
SO THAT WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION

04:28:58.021 --> 04:28:59.256
HIT THOSE OF US SITTING HERE ARE

04:28:59.323 --> 04:29:01.425
FORCED CHOOSE BETWEEN GOOD

04:29:01.492 --> 04:29:03.060
EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN.

04:29:03.126 --> 04:29:04.294
OR OFFERING HEALTH CARE AND

04:29:04.361 --> 04:29:06.497
SERVICES TO OUR SENIORS.

04:29:06.563 --> 04:29:07.931
IT IS NOT A PERFECT PROPOSAL BUT

04:29:07.998 --> 04:29:09.233
IS AN IMPROVEMENT.

04:29:09.299 --> 04:29:11.869
I IN IS A GOOD IDEA TO SAVE

04:29:11.935 --> 04:29:13.604
MONEY FOR HARD TIMES IF THIS

04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:15.572
BODY CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE

04:29:15.639 --> 04:29:17.374
CAN DO SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM.

04:29:17.441 --> 04:29:19.676
AND AVOID A CONTINUING BOOM AND

04:29:19.743 --> 04:29:21.078
BUST CYCLES THAT WOULD BE A GOOD

04:29:21.144 --> 04:29:22.713
THING BUT UNTIL WE'RE THERE A

04:29:22.779 --> 04:29:24.281
SAVINGS ACCOUNT MAKES SENSE AND

04:29:24.348 --> 04:29:28.018
I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

04:32:07.611 --> 04:32:08.578
HAD.

04:32:08.645 --> 04:32:10.747
WAS NOT MILD OR MODERATE.

04:32:10.814 --> 04:32:12.849
IT WAS EXTREMELY SEVERE WE HAD

04:32:12.916 --> 04:32:14.518
NOT SEEN A DOWNTURN.

I THINK THAT IT IS.

04:33:59.389 --> 04:34:01.158
AND AS A RESULT OF IT BEING SELF

04:34:01.224 --> 04:34:02.759
EVIDENT THE ONLY CONCLUSION WE

04:34:02.826 --> 04:34:04.928
CAN COME.

04:34:04.995 --> 04:34:08.431

THIS RECORD HIGH SPENDING.

04:34:15.005 --> 04:34:16.840

04:34:23.213 --> 04:34:24.714
SECONDLY.

04:34:24.781 --> 04:34:26.683
WHERE DOING A HORRIBLE INJUSTICE

04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:28.418
TO THE WHOLE NOTION OF WHAT THE

04:34:28.485 --> 04:34:30.520
VOTERS GO TO THE BALLOT BOX TO

04:34:30.587 --> 04:34:31.988
VOTE ON WHAT PREVIOUS?

04:34:32.055 --> 04:34:33.723
UP LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED.

04:34:33.790 --> 04:34:35.091
IN OTHER WORDS TO DO THIS BAIT

04:34:35.158 --> 04:34:35.759
AND SWITCH.

04:34:35.826 --> 04:34:37.427
WE'RE GOING TO END UP

04:34:37.494 --> 04:34:37.727
[inaudible]

04:34:37.794 --> 04:34:40.130
DECIDING THAT.

04:34:40.197 --> 04:34:42.365
WHAT PREVIOUS LAW REQUIRED THE

04:34:42.432 --> 04:34:44.301
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO?

04:34:44.367 --> 04:34:47.137
WHICH WAS WHEN YOU HAVE SURPLUS

04:34:47.204 --> 04:34:48.939
IT GOES BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS.

04:34:49.005 --> 04:34:50.907
WE'RE GONNA CREATE ESSENTIALLY

04:34:50.974 --> 04:34:52.409
LAWS THAT BASICALLY SAY THOSE

04:34:52.475 --> 04:34:53.210
LAWS DON'T MATTER.

04:34:53.276 --> 04:34:55.378
ANYMORE.

04:34:55.445 --> 04:34:56.847
SO I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AGAIN

04:34:56.913 --> 04:34:58.114
THAT IF YOU RATCHET THE CEILING

04:34:58.181 --> 04:34:59.683
SO HIGH.

04:34:59.749 --> 04:35:02.552
WE WILL NEVER COME TO A PLACE.

04:35:02.619 --> 04:35:07.591
IN WHICH PRUDENT RESPONSIBLE.

04:35:07.657 --> 04:35:09.526
DECISIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO

04:35:09.593 --> 04:35:11.328

FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

04:35:15.465 --> 04:35:17.267
AND WE NEED TO BE WILLING AND

04:35:17.334 --> 04:35:19.569
CAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING THAT

04:35:19.636 --> 04:35:21.304
MANAGING.

04:35:21.371 --> 04:35:23.707
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS OUR FIRST

04:35:23.773 --> 04:35:25.575
AND FOREMOST RESPONSIBILITY NOT

04:35:25.642 --> 04:35:28.345
SIMPLY BLOWING THROUGH EVERY

04:35:28.411 --> 04:35:29.846
EXPENDITURE HISTORY IN THE STATE

04:35:29.913 --> 04:35:31.848

04:35:31.915 --> 04:35:32.883
GROWTH IN THE STATE OF

04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:34.117
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE

04:35:34.184 --> 04:35:37.687
NEAR. TO THE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

04:35:37.754 --> 04:35:39.289
BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING THIS

04:35:39.356 --> 04:35:41.157
YEAR.

04:35:41.224 --> 04:35:42.859
SO WHILE THE WHILE THE GETTING

04:35:42.926 --> 04:35:45.896
IS GOOD.

04:35:45.962 --> 04:35:49.466
THIS BODY RATCHET SET UP. TWO

04:35:49.532 --> 04:35:51.268
UNPRECEDENTED HEIGHTS.

04:35:51.334 --> 04:35:53.169
AMEND THEM SAYS.

04:35:53.236 --> 04:35:55.305
LET'S SAY FOR THAT RAINY DAY

04:35:55.372 --> 04:35:57.374
WHEN ALL OF THIS EXTRA EXCESSIVE

04:35:57.440 --> 04:35:57.707
EXPENDITURES.

04:35:57.774 --> 04:35:59.175
ARE.

04:35:59.242 --> 04:36:01.811
OUGHT TO OF A NATURAL COURSE BE

04:36:01.878 --> 04:36:03.747
MANAGED THROUGH.

04:36:03.813 --> 04:36:05.248
PRECISION AND PAYING ATTENTION

04:36:05.315 --> 04:36:07.918
TO DETAIL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE

04:36:07.984 --> 04:36:10.987

04:36:14.424 --> 04:36:15.191
ON HERE.

04:36:15.258 --> 04:36:16.459
AND I THINK WE'RE BASICALLY

04:36:16.526 --> 04:36:19.229
CREATING AN UNSUSTAINABLE.

04:36:19.296 --> 04:36:21.064
THOUGHT PATHWAY OF SPENDING AND

04:36:21.131 --> 04:36:22.866
