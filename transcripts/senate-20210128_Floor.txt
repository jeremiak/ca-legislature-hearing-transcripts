THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I RISE WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM AND PRIDE IN SUPPORT OF THIS HISTORIC APPOINTMENT A DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER AS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN AS SECRETARY STATE OF THIS. A CALIFORNIA. DR WEBER AS STATED IT'S BEEN A CHAMPION FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE A PILLAR OF INTEGRITY AND A TIRELESS DEFENDER OF OUR DEMOCRACY. I KNOW DOCTOR WEBER FOR FORTY TWO YEARS I HAD THE HONOR OF MEETING HER AS A WIDE EYED. THE NAIVE COLLEGE FRESHMAN AT SAN DIEGO STATE WHEN I ENROLLED IN HER ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS AND I KNEW THEN. THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE SPECIAL. OR THAT SHE WAS SOMEONE SPECIAL I SHOULD STAY STATE. SINCE THEN I'VE HAD THE HONOR TO WITNESS M. PARTNERS. WITH HER ON MANY LANDMARK PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT SHE HAS PIONEERED. WHETHER IT'S CREATING THE NATION'S STRONG AS USE OF FORCE LAW STARTING A COMMISSION FOR THE STUDY OF REPARATION TO REQUIRE AN ETHNIC STUDIES AS A GRADUATING REQUIREMENT ARE CAL STATE SYSTEMS ARE APPEALING PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. DR WEBER HAS FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE OPPORTUNITY AND COMPASSION FOR ALL THE SECRETARY OF STATE POSITION CARRIES. A MONUMENTAL TASK OF MAKING SURE ALL CALIFORNIANS OR FORTY THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE IN THEIR- VOICES ARE HEARD IN ADDITION TO MANY OTHERS RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT OFFICE DR WERE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF LEADING CALIFORNIA THROUGH ITS ELECTIONS OPERATIONS. DR ROBERT HAS ALREADY PROVEN. THEY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF GIVING A VOICE TO THE IGNORED. WHETHER THROUGH OUTREACH OR EDUCATION HE HAS CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFTING OTHERS UP. I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU'LL PUT THIS EXPERTISE TO GREAT USE IN EXPANDING AND PROTECTING VOTER REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DR WEBER BRINGS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE SERVING CALIFORNIA MANY ROLES INCLUDING CITIZENS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION THE N. DOUBLE ACP THE BATTERED WOMAN SERVICE UNITED WAY AND THE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF EDUCATION. I COULD STAND HERE IN THIS CHAMBER. ANALYST ALL THE DISTINGUISHED ACCOLADES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT WE WOULD BE HERE FOR HOURS IF NOT DAYS AS A PERSON WHO IS LED FROM THE FRONT. SHE TACKLES EVERY CHALLENGE HEAD ON IT WILL BE A FEARLESSADVOCATE FOR THE TRUTH. I KNOW THAT OUR DOOR WILL ALWAYS REMAIN OPEN TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND SHE WILL SERVE OUR CRITICISM WHAT DIGNITY AND RESPECT. AS WE WALK ON THE NOTES SHE HAS NO PROBLEM INTIMATING THAT ISSUE AS LONG AS IT TAKES AND TO DO SO WITHOUT BELITTLING OR LOSING RESPECT FOR OTHERS. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT THERE'S PROBABLY NOT BEEN A BETTER ORDER WHO'S REYES TO MIKE UNDER THIS STONE. TO HER PRESENTS IN THE FALL SHE WILL BE SORELY MISSED. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL BRING THE SAME LEVEL PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO OUR ROLE AS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE AS CALIFORNIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT. WE NEED LOOK NO FARTHER THAN DR SHIRLEY WEBER I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD CENTER SKINNER. THANK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE AS T. VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DR SHIRLEY WEBER TO SECRETARY OF STATE. DR WEBER HAS BEEN A VERY ACTIVE AND ENGAGED MEMBER OF OUR WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. AND IS ADMIRED AS EVERYONE WHO HAS SPOKEN SO FAR HAS INDICATED. THE KEY ROLES OF OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS OVERSEEING AND ENSURING. ACCESSIBLE AND SECURE VOTING SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS AND EXPANDS THE VOTING RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN ADDITION THE OTHER KEY ROLE IS THE OVERSEEING OF CORPORATE BUSINESS FILINGS IN CAMPAIGN LOBBYIST FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES. THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER PERSON TO INTROSPECT. THEN MS WEBER. WHOSE FATHER AND GRANDPARENTS COULD NOT VOTE. AND SHE GREW UP WITH DEEP RESPECT AND COMMITMENT TO THE SANCTITY. OF PROTECTING THE VOTE AND THE POWER OF EXERCISING THAT VOTE. HER FAMILY HOME WAS A POLLING PLACE FROM WHEN SHE WAS A CHART. THE INTEGRITY THE DOCTOR WEBER HAS EXHIBITED INTERPUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD GIVE US ALL GREAT CONFIDENCE THAT THE ADDITIONAL ROLES I REFERENCED. WILL BE DONE. WITH THE FISSION SEE. AND WITH THE DILIGENCE THAT THEY DESERVE AND REQUIRE. DR WEBER IS BOLD COURAGEOUS DOES NOT SUFFER FOOLS AND WILL IS I AM SURE WE ARE ALL CONFIDENCE ADMINISTER HER DUTIES AS SECRETARY OF STATE IN A MANNER THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL RESPECT AND ADMIRE TODAY AND FOR YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH DOCTOR WEBER WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. AND THE OPPORTUNITY ALSO TO HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION WITH HER THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW WE CHATTED THIS MORNING AND WE REMINISCED- ABOUT GOSPEL NIGHT THE NIGHT THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OLSON AND MISS WEBBER ACTUALLY TOOK THE MICROPHONE AND SING GOSPEL SONGS. I DID BACKGROUND BECAUSE I CAN'T SEEM. AN BIT SO WE DID THAT- WE JOIN TOGETHER IN UNITY DOING THAT TOO- SENDOFF ARE THEN SPEAKER NOW SENATE PRO TEM. AND WE REMINISCED ABOUT THE PASSIONATE TO DEBATE THAT ALWAYS TOOK PLACE ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE BEING FROM A DIFFERENT PARTY THAN DR WEBER. AND HAVING DIFFERENT IDEOLOGY. THERE WAS VIGOROUS PASSIONATE DEBATE AND THERE IS NO ONE THAT I THINK CAN DEBATE LIKE DR SHIRLEY WEBER. SHE'S PASSIONATE SHE'S KIND AND EVEN DURING PASSIONATE DEBATE RIGHT AFTERWARDS SHE ALWAYS CAME OVER AND SHOWED THE GREATEST KINDNESS TO MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES. AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS OF THE STATE'S PERSON- SOMETIMES WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HOLD GRUDGES WE HAVE DIFFERENCESOF OPINION TO REPRESENT THE DISTRICTS THAT WE REPRESENT. BUT THAT'S NOT DR SHIRLEY WEBER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I THINK DR SHIRLEY WEBER IS BRILLIANT- I DON'T THINK LIKE MY LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO SAID. THERE IS NOT A MORE PROFESSIONAL OR A TOUR THE DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER. SHE CAN WRITE AN RECALL POETRY- SHE'S PASSIONATE. SHE IS- HIGHLY EDUCATED AND BRILLIANT SHE ALSO IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS INVESTED IN THE LEGACY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO TEACH WHAT WE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES. HE'S INVESTED IN STUDENTS FOR GENERATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT LEGACY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS AND THAT THE FLIGHTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH. AND THEIR ENTIRE HISTORY IS NEVER FORGOTTEN. WE DID ALSO TALK ABOUT- MY REASONS WHY COULDN'T SUPPORT HER. AND SHE WAS GRACIOUS IN THE FACT I TOLD HER THAT I BELIEVE IN VOTER INTEGRITY I BELIEVE IN- I BELIEVE IN VOTER ID- VOTING PER GENE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE NEED TO TRUST. AND SHE UNDERSTOOD- AS GRACIOUS AS SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO ME. I WISH HER THE VERY VERY BEST I MAKES I TOLD HER I WAS VERY EXCITED THAT SHE'S THE SECOND WOMAN TO EVER TAKE THIS POSITION AND THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN TO TAKE THIS POSITION. AND SO- I THINK THAT SHE WILL DO EIGHT A PASSIONATE HEARTFELT JOB. BUT AGAIN OUR IDEOLOGY JUST DOESN'T MATCH UP SO I DID LET HER KNOW THAT I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT HER. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE I THINK THAT WHO SHE IS AS AN INDIVIDUAL IS ONE OF THE MOST GREATEST STATES WOMEN STATE PERSONS THAT IS SERVED. IN THIS BUILDING THANK YOU. THE GROVE SO WE SAW ONE OF YOU KNOW THAT I SEE YOU I DO HAVE PEOPLE AHEAD OF YOU. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I AM HONORED TO RISE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF DR SHIRLEY WEBER THE PLAME INTO THE CALIFORNIA US SECRETARY OF STATE I HAD THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH DR WEBBER WITH SO MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES AS IT PERTAINS TO EDUCATION AND EQUITY AND THERE WASN'T A TIME THAT I DID AND LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS AMAZING LEADER. SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE LEADER AND A FIGHTER WHO WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS AND SHE WILL ALSO BE A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR OUR YOUTH AND CONTINUE TO PUSH AND SUPPORT. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT DR WELFARE IS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO EVER HOLD THE SEAT. SO FOR ME THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT. FOR ALL OF US. I REST ASSURED THAT SHE WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD AND THAT EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED. AS A FORMER TEACHER AND LONGTIME EDUCATOR IT JUST GIVES ME GREAT PRIDE TO SEE HER RISE TO THE RANK THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND I KNOW THAT ALL MY FELLOW TEACHERS ARE ALSO AS PROUD AS I AM TODAY IN THIS MOMENT.

BEFORE ABOUT HER FAMILY FROM HOPE ARKANSAS. BETTER EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY FOR HER WHOLE FAMILY AND HER AND HER UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS. WE'VE HEARD HERE FROM OUR COLLEAGUES TO SO MANY OF HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I JUST WANT TO SPEAK TO HER CHARACTER AND HER NATURE. BECAUSE HERE'S SOMEONE WHO IN THE VERY ESSENCE OF HER POETRY OF HER ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE OVER ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND AND GROW THERE IS NO CHALLENGE WHEN YOU MEET ONCE IN OUR LIFE WE MEET PEOPLE LIKE THIS AND WE KNOW THEM WE SEE THEM THEY ARE EXTRAORDINARY A QUARTER CENTER THIS DOME THAT WE HAVE A FEW OF US HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE. BUT IT IS IN SO MANY OTHER CONTEXTS IN THE ARRAY OF ISSUES THAT SHE WILL DEAL WITH AND HAS DEALT WITH AND SO I LOOK TO SOMEONE'S CHARACTER TO THEIR SKILL SETS TWO KINDS OF INTEGRITY THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WITH RESPECT TO HER AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT SHE WILL MAKE US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS PROUD. AND THAT SHE WILL SERVE WITH GREAT INTEGRITY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I STRENGTH STAND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BETTER PRETEND- I STAND ALSO AS A OF A STAND ON BEHALF LGBT CAUCUS TO SPEAK IN THE SUPPORT OF DR WEBER'S- SECRETARY OF STATE. TODAY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF COMING IN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE A DOCTOR WEBER. AS MANY OF THE BIG CLASS WE ALL CAME IN TOGETHER AND I'LL NEVER FORGET HER STANDING UP AND TALKING ABOUT SHE DIDN'T COME HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS SHE HAD PLENTY OF FRIENDS AT HOME SHE GOT PLENTY OF COLLEAGUES. AND SHE WAS HERE TO DO THE PEOPLE'S WORK. AND THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT SHE SET OUT TO DO. AND I THINK SO MANY OF US TOOK THE CAR AND TOOK COURAGE EVERY TIME SHE REYES AT MICHAEL SAT DOWN BECAUSE WE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO USE THAT GIFT. THAT WAS GIVEN TO HER BY GOD AND HER ANCESTORS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. SO THAT WE CAN ALL HEAR. AND LISTEN WE DID. AND WE ALSO HEARD HER VERY ELOQUENTLY SAY NO TO SO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS THAT SOMETIMES WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK ABOUT HER BRILLIANCE I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT HER COURAGE. AND HER ABILITY TO KNOW WHAT THE NORTH STAR IS AND WHAT SHE CAME TO DO. I WHETHER THAT IT WAS SAYING NO TO OUR FRIENDS IN THE LABOR COMMUNITY. WHICH IS ISSUES OF EDUCATION BECAUSE SHE WAS VERY VERY CLEAR. EDUCATION SHOULD BE THERE ABOUT THE CHILD ABOUT RAISING THAT CHILD AND REMOVING EVERY BAY AREA POSSIBLE. SHE WAS RELENTLESS WITH THAT. WHETHER IT'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND SITTING DOWN WITH OUR FRIENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FINDING WAYS TO COME TO THAT COMMON AGREEMENT. WHETHER WAS ISSUES AROUND AT CIVIL JUSTICE ISSUES AND STILL BEING ABLE TO USE HER VOICE. I SAT IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM WITH HER THERE WAS MANY OF US HAVE A OVER A CERTAIN AGE THAT SAT IN THE BACK AND I. WOULD SHARE. AND THINK ABOUT THE WORK THAT IS DONE ON THIS FLOOR THE GRACE THAT IS GIVEN THE CONFLICTS THAT OCCUR. AND HOW SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED TO BE ABLE TO. SET UP IN THE BALCONY AND LOOKED DOWN FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF HISTORY AND TO KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO GO. AND TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO GET IT TO THAT PLACE. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE STATE BETTER PREPARED TO STEP INTO THE POSITION OF SECRETARY OF STATE. TO LEAD US IN THE NEXT COUPLE WAYS TO ENSURE. THAT EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS THE VOTING IS PROTECTED. THAT THAT CONFIDENCE IS RESTORED- IT. WITH ALL. WITH ALL THAT IS- I ASK FOR. THE CONFERMENT OF DR SHIRLEY WEBER TO THE POSITION OF SCRETARY OF STATE. AND TO CONTINUE TO USE HER GREAT GIFTS TO ALL OF US. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN CENTER HUESO.

ARE YOU HAPPY FOR U. S. B. TWENTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE ELECTION OFFICIALS TO MAIL A VOTE BY MAIL IN BALLOT TO EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER FOR SPECIAL ACTIONS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ALSO REQUIRE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO USE VOTE BY MAIL TRACKING SYSTEM. TO ALLOW VOTERS TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS- THIS FALL THIS BILL WILL EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE EXPAND IN THE NOVEMBER. ONLY TWENTY ELECTION. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC AND PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF VOTERS AS WELL AS ELECTION WORKERS IS A CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY- WE HAVE THE HIGHEST TURNOUT WE'VE HAD SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMAN. WAS IN OFFICE BY THEWAY IS AN ASIDE WHEN MY STAFF MEMBERS ASKED TO A VOTED FOR NOT LIKE AND I DID NOT HOLD NOT ELECTION. THE BE ALL VOTE IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TURNOUT WAS OVER 80% IT IS. ATTENTIVELY SORT OF POIGNANT THAT WE ARE CONFIRMING DR WEBER IS SECRETARY OF STATE TODAY. BECAUSE WE HAD A ELECTION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THAT REALLY EXCEEDED OTHER ELECTIONS DETAILING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS IS A PERSON WITH THE KIND OF INTEGRITY. AND INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ELECTION AND% ELECTIONS GOING FORWARD THAT MEET THAT STANDARD ENACTED EXCEED THAT STANDARD AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS ARE TO NOVEL. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG CENTER JONES I'M SORRY MEMBERS DISCUSSION IN ORDER BATES AND- JONES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS UNFORTUNATELY I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND I REALLY WISH I COULD SUPPORT- BECAUSE I REPRESENT A RURAL DISTRICT THAT- YOU KNOW MANY VOTERS IN MY AREA HAVE BEEN VOTING BY MAIL FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THERE USED TO BE A MEASUREMENT OF SECURITY IN THE MAIL BALLOT. HE USED TO- HAVE TO SHOW WHO YOU WERE WHEN YOU REGISTERED. YOU HAVE TO USE AFTER THE MAIL THAT IN YOURSELF WHAT THE SIGNATURE- AFFIRMING THAT YOU'RE THE VOTER. AND THAT YOUR AND THAT'S YOUR BALLOT INSIDE THE ENVELOPE. UNFORTUNATELY. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF DEBATE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDING THE SECURITY OF OUR MAIL IN BALLOTS AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ANECDOTAL- YOU KNOW STORIES FROM AROUND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN OTHER STATES OF THE COUNTRY AND DEBATE ON THE- SECURITY OF THOSE MAIL IN BALLOTS FOR LET ME JUST. SHARE WITH YOU. PERSONALLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ANECDOTAL. IN THIS LAST MAIL IN BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. I HAD TO- CONSTITUENTS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY. THAT RECEIVED THEY VOTED BY MAIL. MAILED IT IN AND THEN RECEIVED A SECOND BALLOT BOTH THE HUSBAND AND THE WIFE. AND THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES THEY ARE NOT ANECDOTAL AND I'LL BET YOU IF ALL OF YOU- WENT BACK TO YOUR STAFF IN YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE AND LOOK AT YOUR LCMS AND- ASKED YOU KNOW FOR SOME CALLS OR SOME EMAILS. ON THE BALLOT SECURITY ALL THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAVE SOME KIND OF STORY FROM A CONSTITUENT.THAT HAS SHARED AN ACTUAL STORY. OF THEIR BALLOT NOT BEING SECURE. NOW IF WE COULD SHOW INCALIFORNIA THAT THE MAIL IN BALLOT IS SECURE I WOULD. WHOLE AND- I. EXCITEDLY AS SUPPORT A MAIL IN BALLOT STATEWIDE. AND MAILED TO EVERYBODY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE NOT THERE ON THE BALLOT SECURITY AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER JONES MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SENATOR WIENER. FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TRYING TO PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT TO TRY TO DELEGITIMIZE VOTING IN THIS COUNTRY TO TRY TO. TO TRY TO RESTRICT WHO CAN VOTE IT'S NO LONGER LEGAL TO ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY BANNING CERTAIN KINDS OF PEOPLE FROM VOTING THE WAY THAT WE USED TO IN THIS COUNTRY BASED ON RACE OR WHATEVER ELSE SO NOW WE SEE EFFORTS TO RESTRICT VOTING THROUGH OTHER MORE NEFARIOUS WAYS IN SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME RESULT. BUT IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY LABELED BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS KIND OF PERSON COUNT VOTER THAT KIND OF PERSON CAN VOTE AND WE THEATER EFFORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH THESE VOTER ID LAWS WITH- FRANKLY ILLEGAL PURCHASE OF VOTERS AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WITH OTHER STATES WE'RE MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE NOT HARDER AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE LEARNED FROM THIS LAST ELECTION. IS THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD IMPROPRIETIES AND TAKE VOTING ARE COMPLETELY BOGUS AND WE LEARNED THAT NOT JUST FROM DEMOCRATS BUT FROM REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND SECRETARIES OF STATE WHO SAID THE VOTE WAS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE AND LEGAL AND NOT. FRAUDULENT SO THIS. MEASURE TODAY ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO MOVE STRONGLY IN THAT DIRECTION. OF EXTENDING THE FRANCHISE TO MORE PEOPLE MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER PAN- MADAM PRESIDENT TO SENATORS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. TWENTY NINE- HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY MY COUNTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WAS- ONE THE PILOT COUNTIES FOR A VOTE BY MAIL- SEVERAL ACTION CYCLES AGO AND- IN FACT IT TURNED OUT VERY SUCCESSFULLY. AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF ANY PROBLEMS OR FRAUD- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT OUR ELECTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS AND THAT MEANS THAT IS COMING ON US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS NOT TO INSINUATES PROBLEMS UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THAT- ARE PAST SECRETARY OF STATE IS NOW ARE YOU A CENTER AND OUR FUTURE SECRETARY OF STATE I'M SURE. THE GATE- ANY ISSUES THAT ARISE- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF WE ARE AWARE EACH OF US IS ELECTED OFFICIALS- ARE AWARE OF PROBLEMS THEN WE SHOULD. HAVE THEM IVESTIGATED SO WE CAN HAVE AN ACTUAL- RULING ON WHAT THE LEVEL OF TALENT AS IT IS NOW I WILL POINT OUT THOUGH IS THAT CERTAINLY THIS HAS BEEN DONE. AND IN FACT- ARE- MEDIA PAST PRESENT UNITED STATES ACTUALLY CONVENED A COMMISSION AND THEN DISBANDED WINDOWS NO SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT THEY FOUND- IN ADDITION THERE BEEN NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS DONE OF ALLEGATIONS HERE IN THIS COUNTRY BY. ELECTION OFFICIALS OF BOTH PARTIES. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS BENDS ADDITION WE'VE HAD OUR INDEPENDENT PRESS ALSO TRADED INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT FOUND SIGNIFICATIONS SO I HOPE THAT WE WHO ACTUALLY- ARE IN OUR POSITIONS BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION SYSTEM WE HAVE SO WE A PROBLEM TODAY I GUESS WE SHOULD QUESTION OUR OWN PRESENCE HERE. WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO INSINUATE. SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WHEN THERE IS WE CANNOT PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THEY EXIST AND SO WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON SB TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU CENTER PANTS CENTER BRADFORD. THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. TWENTY NINE AND- I'M SOMEWHAT DISMAYED WHEN I HEAR SOME OF THE BOGUS ARGUMENTS ON WHY. INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MAIL IN THEIR BALLOTS BUT IT'S REALLY IRONIC TO ME THAT. MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO. ARGUED ABOUT. VOTER IRREGULARITIES AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THE TOP OF THE BALLOT. THEY WERE QUITE FINING BEING SWORN IN INVALIDATING THEIR ELECTION BE IT TO CONGRESO THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT- EVERYTHING ELSE AT THE TOP WAS BOGUS SO- I THINK YOU NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT YOURSELVES AND I. ASK THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO- PREVENT FROM VOTING I THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE CONCERNS THIS WAS STATED- EVERY PLACE THAT. THE SELECTION WAS QUESTION- OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND A POOR PEOPLE AND- IT IN THIS IS WHO THIS IS TARGETING SAME HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M EXCITED ABOUT DR WEBER- BECOMING OUR NEW SECRETARY OF STATE AND I THINK THE ACCOLADES THAT EVEN THE FOLKS SPOKE ABOUT DR WEBER'S INTEGRITY EVEN THOSE WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR SPEAKS TO WHY THEY SHOULD. VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEONE NOW WHO WILL MAKE SURE AND CONTINUE ON IN A FINE EXAMPLE OF OUR PREVIOUS SECRETARY OF STATE MAKE SURE ALL VOTES ARE COUNTED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDING WHAT YOUR PARTY IS WHAT YOUR GENDER WHAT'S YOUR ECONOMIC STATUS SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD MEMBERS SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE- AMBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TWENTY FIRST RESPOND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WITH RESPECT TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTING BY MAIL. WOULD BE TO GET A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT YOU HAVE TO BE REGISTERED YOU HAVE TO SIGN A SIGNATURE CARD. AND WHEN YOU VOTE BY MAIL THT SIGNATURES CHECK ONE IS RETURNED AND IN FACT NOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY. TRACKED THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE. ILLEGALITIES ARE ABNORMALITIES THEY SHOULD BE REPORTED. BUT AS OTHERS SUGGESTED THOSE REPORTS HAVE BOND. INVESTIGATED BUT FOUND NOT TO BE PARTICULARLY- THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO WRONG THERE ARE FOR THE MOST PART. LET ME ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. FOR TWO CENTURIES WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE ISSUE OF WHO. MAY AND MAY NOT VOTE. TO CENTER AGO ONLY MEN LANDOWNERS OLD TO VOTE ART TODAY WE'VE EXPANDED GREATLY AS IS APPROPRIATE. AS IS RIGHT. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS ENABLES THOSE WHO ARE IN MARIN COMMUNITIES THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE WELL THOSE NO CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR HEALTH THE BILL TO VOTE. FROM HOME. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. ALL OTHER POINTS IS IT. WHEN WE CHALLENGE THE PROCESS AND WE SUGGESTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT SELECTION WAS STOLEN YOU ARE HERE OTHER PLACES WE DO GREAT HARM TO DEMOCRACY. OUR WORDS HAVE POWER AND THAT POWER THEN CAN INFLUENCE OTHERS IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS ELECTION WAS ELECTION HELD WITH INTEGRITY. AND THEY RESORT TO OTHER MEANS FAVORS ARE TWO OTHER NAMES TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LISTEN TO PEOPLE LIKE BILL BARR EVEN MITCH MCCONNELL WHO SAYS THIS ELECTION. WAS DONE IN A WAY THAT AMERICANS CAN BE PROUD OF. WE HAVE TO BE CONFIDENT AND WE HAVE TO EXPRESS OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM THIS IS THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN WE CANNOT UNDERMINE THE TIRED TONIGHT BOTH.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE PLEASE LET US KNOW WE WILL GET YOU ONE. ADAM SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE READ THE ASSEMBLY MESSAGE. MADAM PRESIDENT I AM DIRECTED TO INFORM YOUR HONORABLE BODY THAT THE ASSEMBLY AMENDED AND ON THIS DAY PASSED AS AMENDED SENATE BILL EIGHTY NINE AND SENATE BILL NINETY ONE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS YOUR HONORABLE BODY TO CONCURRENCE SAID AMENDMENTS TO PARKER CHIEF CLERK OF THE ASSEMBLY ABOVE BILLS ORDER TO UNFINISHED BUSINESS FILE. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY MEMBERS WILL START WITH FILE ITEM FIVE SB EIGHTY NINE SENATOR SKINNER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL EIGHTY NINE BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BELT. SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND BEFORE PERCENT THIS BE EIGHTY NINE. SO I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT EVEN PRIOR TO THE A PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA HAD ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHO ALREADY FACED. HAVING TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 50% OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS RENT. SINCE THE PANDEMIC ACCORDING TO DATA BY OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. 53% BOB THE JOB LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED. PANDEMIC ARE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THOSE SAME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ALREADY WELL THEY HAD JOBS WERE FACING PUTTING 50% OF THEIR INCOME TO RENT. WE PASSED THE BILL LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH PROVIDED A FICTION PROTECTIONS THAT ARE SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WE NOW KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE MANY MANY PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED. AND MANY PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR FULL RENT WHICH NOT ONLY IMPACTS THAT HOUSEHOLD BUT POPULARLY OBVIOUSLY IMPACTS THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY WHO STILL HAVE BILLS AND MUST MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL PASSAGE OF THE LATEST CARES ACT IN DECEMBER PROVIDES TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE. TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO THE BILLS BEFORE US HELP US EXTEND THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE PROVIDED LAST YEAR AND GREEN LIGHT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE BILL YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW IS A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR SB EIGHTY NINE ASSOCIATED WITH BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY AND IT SETS UP THESE ITEMS FOR THE PRINTER FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE FOLLOWING BILL ALL PRESENT SB NINETY ONE. SERVICE BE EIGHTY NINE IS TECHNICAL. JUST FACILITY THE ABILITY FOR US TO DO WHAT IS IN SB NINETY ONE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. LETTERPRESS LED DOWN THE SENATE I WOULD FIND THIS MEASURE AS WE SAW IT BEFORE WORTHY OF AN AYE VOTE. THERE ARE STILL SOME DEFICIENCIES IN IT I THINK I BELIEVE THAT THE ASSURANCES TO LANDLORDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT AND THAT THEY CAN YET BE SORT CHANGED. I REALIZE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT DOES NEED TO BE EXPEDITED AND THEREFORE I SUPPORT THE MEASURE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. CENTER GROVE DID- NOPE DID I SEE YOUR HEAD UP I DID NOT ALL RIGHT MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING. CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

SANDERS CAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR STAFF AND THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS. WHO SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF HOURS. NEGOTIATING WHAT WE JUST VOTED ON AND WHAT I AM PRESENTING RIGHT NOW. TO PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE KNOW SO MANY OF OUR RENTERS AND THEY'RE LANDLORDS THEIR PROPERTY OWNERS NEED RIGHT NOW. SB NINETY ONE. IS THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND- EVICTION PROTECTION BUDGET TRAILER BILL. IT SUPPORTS RENTERS AND OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY COVE IT. AND IT BALANCES THE NEEDS OF THOSE TENANTS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING ABLE TO MEET THEIR RENT WITH INCENTIVES FOR LANDLORDS COOPERATION BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT THOSE LANDLORDS THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS TO RECEIVE. A GOOD PORTION OF THE BACK RENT. THE BILL EXTENDS THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND OTHER RENTAL OF PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED IN AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT UNTIL JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IT SETS UP THE STATE'S RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITH THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WERE APPROPRIATED ENACTED CIMBER CARES ACT. IT ALLOCATES THE FUNDING TO LOCALITIES BY POPULATION INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO SMALL AND RURAL COUNTIES. THERE IS ADDITIONALLY FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL MONIES THAT GO DIRECTLY TO MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND IT WILL BE MANAGED EITHER LOCALLY OR BY A CONTRACTED STATEWIDE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER. AND IT PROVIDES FOR THOSE LANDLORDS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE 80% OF THE BACK RENT THAT THEIR TENANTS- AND THE REST IS FORGIVEN. AND IT PROVIDES 25% IF THE LANDLORDS DO NOT PARTICIPATE BUT IT DOES ENSURE THAT AT LEAST THERE IS A FICTION PROTECTIONS. AND IT INCLUDES LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR RENTERS TO ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE. AND WITH THAT MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR ATKINS. YOU SO MUCH HI COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY ONE WHICH WOULD EXTEND THE EVICTIONS MORATORIUM AND HELP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. CLEARLY ONE OF OUR MOST URGENT AND CRITICAL NEEDS RIGHT NOW. REMENT REACHED EARLIER THIS WEEK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM WHICH RELIES ON A FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MAKES CALIFORNIA'S MORATORIUM AND THE STRONGEST OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY. AND THAT SPELL STABILITY FOR TENANTS AND SMALL LANDLORDS. AS THE BUDGET CHAIR SAID IT STRIKES A BALANCE OF STABILIZING RENT PAYMENTS WHILE EXTENDING THE SAME KIND OF DO NO HARM PROTECTIONS. FOR TENANTS THAT WE ENACTED UNDER AB THIRTY THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDES ADDITIONAL COVERT NINETEEN TENANT PROTECTIONS AGAINST UNFORGIVING CREDITORS AND BAD ACTING LANDLORDS. IT ALSO HELPS SMALL LANDLORDS WHO RELY ON RENT AS BASIC INCOME AND ARE ON THE BRINK OF LOSING THEIR PROPERTIES TO FORECLOSURE. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT THE END. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS WILL WORK AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP REAL CALIFORNIANS. SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO SAY THAT IT WILL. AND PART OF OUR WORK OVER THESE NEXT DAYS AND WEEKS HAS TO BE TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS UNDERSTAND HOW THIS EXTENSION WILL PROVIDE RELIEF TO THOSE IN NEED. THAT'S OUR CHARGE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IN THE MONTHS AHEAD WHICH INCLUDES OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PROGRAM. AND PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT WORKING. SO WE CAN GARNER ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE OR FLEXIBILITY FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED. AS CALIFORNIANS WE FIND OURSELF IN THAT PERFECT STORM. LITERALLY TODAY AND FIGURATIVELY A PANDEMIC. RECORD UNEMPLOYMENT AND A HOUSING CRISIS. AS LONG OAK MAKERS WE FND OURSELVES IN THE MOMENT THAT REQUIRES TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP. FOCUS AND IN THE WORDS OF OUR- PRIOR PRO TEN. INTENTIONALITY I THINK THAT WORD APPLIES HERE TODAY. I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES PARTICULARLY ARE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER THE SENATORS FROM SALINAS GUARDINO BERKELEY AND SANTA ANA FOR THEIR INITIATIVE AND SKILL IN GUIDING THESE TALKS. WE ARE PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE PLIGHT THAT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES ARE FACING AS THEY STRUGGLE TO PAY THE RENT. OR MORTGAGES AT NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF THE PIN PAD TO MAKE THAT WE ARE IN. IT'S A BURDEN FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE CARRYING TODAY. AS THEY FIGHT TO KEEP THEIR HOUSING THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR HEALTH. SO TODAY WE HELP CALIFORNIANS KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE WATER. COLLEAGUES I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS. SENATOR CORTESE. OKAY COMMITTEE PRESIDENT OF A- IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY ONE- AND I WANT TO TAKE OUR OWN LEADERSHIP FOR. THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN IN BRINGING THIS TO BEAR IN A TIMELY MANNER. THAT SAID THERE WAS A ROBUST DISCUSSION- AT THE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE JUST. EARLIER THIS WEEK AND I WANNA MAKE SURE TO MEMORIALIZE- AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THE POINTS. THAT ARE RAISED DURING THAT DISCUSSION- AND BY ASSOCIATION ACKNOWLEDGE THE MANY SIMILAR COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BUT I THINK IF THERE WERE A SLOGAN THAT WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER AS WE MOVE THIS EFFORT OF A TO THE RANK AND FILE RESIDENTS- IT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WOULD BE AVOID THE OVERWHELM. IN ONE OF MY CONCERNS. AGAIN WHICH WAS RAISED. ON WEDNESDAY. IS THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE- AND ALLOW ME SAY PARENTHETICALLY OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT SUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT. BUT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE SAYS. WELL THAT THE P. THAT THIS BILL REQUIRES A PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN APPLICATION PORTAL IN SYSTEM THE SERVICE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. HAS MOBILE AND MULTI LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOWS AN APPLICANT TO TRACK THE STATUS OF THEIR APPLICATION. AND REQUIRES THE APPLICATION SYSTEM TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF EXPORTS EXPECTED. USE WITHOUT DISRUPTION- THE QUESTION WAS A- THAT COMMITTEE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT SYSTEM WOULD INCLUDE A CALL CENTER- WELL WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL. A BUDGET EFFORT IN THE EARLY ACTIONS SO THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO US A BEYOND- THE MEASURES TODAY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- IN THE EQUITY CONCERNS AROUND THAT HAVE BEEN. AN ONGOING CONCERN I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR. IGNORE TO MY COMMENTS ON WEDNESDAY IN MEMORIALIZING GOT TWENTY. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR ME I FEEL TODAY I TO GET ON THE RECORD AT LEAST A MESSAGE IN PUBLIC BUT TO THOSE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM- IN TERMS OF OUR OWN ADMINISTRATION. ARE THAT IT'S CRITICAL. THAT THE PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICTS WERE GOING TO BE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN- CURIOUS TOO CONFUSED OR TOO NEEDY WITH REGARD TO THIS PROGRAM I HAVE THE ABILITY TO TALK TO SOMEBODY CULTURALLY COMPETENT. SOMEBODY WHO CAN GIVE THEM ANSWERS THE SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT A BOT BUT SOMEBODY WHO'S A REAL HUMAN BEING. AND THAT SOMEBODY I DON'T BELIEVE CAN BE PROVIDED. BY THIS LEGISLATURE. THROUGH ITS OWN. I THINK WE'VE KNOWN THAT WE TRY TO IN THE INTEREST PAST- AND WHAT WE GET IS OVERWHELMED. SO WITH THOSE COMMENTS I DO WANNA. IF WE JUST. HI THE MY OFF OF THIS CAN TO SUGGEST THAT IN ADDITION TO OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE WHICH- THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT INDICATES OF WILL BE AVAILABLE PROVIDED THROUGH PREVIOUS GENERAL FUND- MEASURES- THE ACTUAL. THE LANDLORD TENANT MEDIATION SERVICES BE PART OF WHATEVER ROLE WHATEVER- THE THAT BECOMES PART OF THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS ROLE- WITH THIS MEASURE WITH THAT. ARAMBULA PRESIDENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO GET THOSE COMMENTS ON THE RECORD IN IN IN IN ESSENCE BRING THEM FORWARD FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE. THIRTY CABALLERO. FIFTY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. NINETY ONE FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE PRO TEM AND MAJORITY LEADER FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP. AND THE ROLES THAT THEY PLAYED IN HELPING TO BRING THIS- AGREEMENT TOGETHER AS WELL AS THEIR STAFFS WHO WORKED. THINGS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF US AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND WEEK WEEKEND AS WELL IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED SECOND- I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY PARTICULARLY THE MAJORITY LEADER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING TO GET THIS DONE. ON TIME SO THAT WE CAN GET A SIGNATURE FROM THE GOVERNOR AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- COMMUNICATING TO ALL RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RENT. THAT THIS MORATORIUM HAS BEEN EXTENDED. THEY'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER GREAT FEAR FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM THAT THEY WERE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS REALLY AN- IMPORTANT. AND FINALLY I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE- SENATOR FROM GUARDINO AND HIS STAFF FOR JOINING ME IN THIS EFFORT. SINCE EARLY LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD THE ORIGINAL SENATE BILL TO INSURE THAT CAL. FOR YOUR FAMILIES ARE MADE HOUSE DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS TODAY WITH THE PANDEMIC HAS DONE TO OUR- TO OUR RESIDENTS IN IN IN OUR DISTRICTS WE'VE RECEIVED PHONE CALLS WE'VE TALKED WITH PEOPLE WE'VE HAD- ZOOM MEETINGS WITH THEM AND- THE IMPACTS HAVEN'T REALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO. HAVE BEEN LAID OFF WHO HAVE HAD THEIR HOURS SLASHED AND WHO HAVE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN ECONOMIC DISARRAY BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. OTHER THAN GOVERNMENT LARGESSE TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND THE REASON IS THAT THIS IS. TREMENDOUSLY IMPACTED MY COMMUNITY THE FARMWORKERS. IS THAT WHEN YOU GET SICK. THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT WAGES WHEN YOU GET SICK YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO- EARN A LIVING AND YOUR FAMILY AND EVERYBODY IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD SUFFERS. AS EARLY AS ONE MONTH AFTER THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ENACTED TO STAY AT HOME ORDER I LIKE MANY OF YOU BEGAN HEARING FROM OUR RESIDENTS. THAT THEY WERE FALLING BEHIND ON THE RENT AND THEY HAD LOST BECAUSE THEY HAD LOST THEIR JOB. AND AT THAT TIME YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL STEPPED IN AND THEY BLOCKED ANY EVICTION AND DECLARED A MORATORIUM AND THAT'S- THAT WAS TREMENDOUSLY. THAT REALLY GAVE US THE THAT WE NEEDED TO ABLE TO ACT. AND WE DO WE PASS AB. EIGHTY EIGHT THE- ASSISTANCE OUR- OF THAT. AND THE SENATE AND A SINGLE FROM THE GOVERNOR WE KNEW IT OUR WORK WAS FAR FOR OVER. A TO DATA FROM THE EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA HAS LOST NEARLY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. CAN EMPLOYMENT RATE EXCEEDED SIXTEEN PERCENT. WHICH IS HIGHER THAN ANY POINT DURING THE RECESSION AND IN MY DISTRICT IT'S BEEN DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT THE ENTIRE TIME AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. EVD HAS PROCESSED OVER EIGHTEEN MILLION CLAIMS BIRD NUMEROUS EMPLOYEE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS. AND SO- ON THE BOTTOM LINE IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT IS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED. AND WHILE THE EXACT FIGURE OF WHAT PAST DUE RENT WHAT THE AMOUNT OF PAST DUE RENT. VACILLATE FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DEBT. THAT IS LOOMING AND IT IS GOING AND ACCORDING TO THE- ONE OF THE LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY WITH. THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE PAST DUE RENT IN THEIR REGION IS THAT WITHOUT SOME ECONOMIC RELIEF TENANTS WILL BE BURDENED BY RENTAL RENTAL DEBT. FOR THEIR LIFETIME. I MEAN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THEIR LIFETIME. THEY WILL NEVER EVER BE ABLE TO PAY. PAST RENT DO BECAUSE I'LL ALWAYS BE WORRIED ABOUT PAYING TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD RIGHT NOW UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM. WITH THE RELIEF THAT THEY NEED NEED. SO THAT'S WHY NEED WE NEED TO ACT NOW TO TURKEY FOR NOW RELIEF. WHEN WE BE TO RIVAS. AB THIRTY EIGHT AND HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL RESOURCES WE HAD THREE MAIN GOALS. IN ORDER TO CREATE CERTAINTY IN THE HOUSING MARKET AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IS. TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE HOME IN THE HOMES THAT THEY'RE RENTING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME SO FIRST AND FOREMOST IT WAS TO EXTEND THE MORATORIUM. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THERE IS NO REATER PRIORITY SECOND WE WANTED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LANDLORDS SMALL LANDLORDS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT RENT FROM THEIR TENANTS AND ARE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. OR THEIR ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THAT INCOME IN ORDER TO PAY THEIR BY THEIR OWN BILLS AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR FAMILY NEEDS AS WELL. SO AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THE SITUATION WE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT TENANTS WERE DROWNING IN DEBT COULD GET BACK ON THEIR FEET SO THAT THEY COULD. THEY WOULDN'T BE SETTLED BY THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN. RENTAL DEBT AND FINALLY. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US WAS TO. PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE LEGAL AGE THAT I'VE BEEN. ASSUMING THE BURDEN OF INFORMING. TENANTS OF THEIR RIGHTS AND TRYING TO PROTECT THEM FROM ILLEGAL EVICTIONS. THAT ARE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO EXPEDITE. THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT WE ALREADY PUT IN THE BUDGET. LAST YEAR THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. BOB FOR LEGAL AID OFFICES WERE STRUGGLING TO HELP TENANTS AND THAT WILL BE EXPEDITED AS PART OF THIS. PROCESS IS NOT IN THIS BILL BUT IT IS IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND I BELIEVE THE MEASURE BEFORE US PROVIDES IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA TO NEED MOST. SO THAT WE CAN SEE A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL EVERY DAY MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING THE VACCINE AND ONE OF THESE DAYS ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS BEHIND US. BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET. SO IN THE MEANTIME THIS SENATOR FROM GUARDIAN AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE HAVE THE BILL SB THREE THAT- WE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH- IT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL- AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS REALLY IS A COMPROMISE IS NOT A PERFECT BILL IT'S A COMPROMISE. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD TO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WITH MY OFFICE I KNOW I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH YEARS WITHOUT YOUR INPUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO REACH THIS COMPROMISED. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE TODAY ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY CAN STAY IN THE HOUSE IN THEIR HOUSE OR APARTMENT THAT THEY'RE RENTING. AND THAT WE HAVE SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ON THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PAY TO HELP PAY DOWN SOME OF THE DEBT AND HELP SOME OF OUR SMALL AND LARGE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO SENATOR. THANK YOU MA'AM. I RISE- CALL. SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE. AND LAST AUGUST WE WERE OUT TO- PUT- AND- I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE THING TO DO WITH THE COPIER THAT WE WOULD NOT- IN THIS MONTH UNLESS THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO LANDLORDS. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIX A PROBLEM IF YOU'RE ONLY ADDRESSING HALF OF IT I STILL FEEL THAT WAY TODAY. THIS FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. THAT'S A JOKE. NOW IT'S A GOOD START BUT ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO NEED MUCH MORE AND I DON'T KNOW THE FULL BREADTH OF- MY COLLEAGUES BILL SB THREE- AND WHAT THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR LANDLORDS. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO HONOR- THE INTERESTS AND- THE HOPE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO- NOT ONLY THE TENANTS BUT ALSO LANDLORDS CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO STEP UP. IN COMPLEMENT THIS FEDERAL FUNDING. SO ALL THESE FRESNO IS THE AS A QUICK EXAMPLE APPARENTLY- IN PHASE ONE OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THE MEDIAN INCOME IN FRESNO IS FIFTY THOUSAND. THAT MEANS HOUSEHOLDS EARNING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM WE'RE BY THE LANDLORD RETROACTIVELY IS ABLE TO- ACCUMULATE- IN SATISFIED PASS DEBTS FOR THE YEAR- BUT WE KNOW THAT IS A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE RENTING. FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. I THAT I THINK A OF SOME THE SAID ISRAEL TWO WHERE YOU OF COMMUNITIES. AFFECTED BY COBIT AS TO TURN BY THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS I KNOW THAT IT WILL FIND ITS WAY OUT IN THROUGH ITS SYSTEM. BUT I THINK WE NEED A BIT MORE CLARITY ON WHAT DISCRETION IN METRICS AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE IN ROUND TWO. AND FINALLY IN ROUND THREE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED BY IN ROUND ONE OR TWO WITH INCOMES LESS THAN. EIGHTY PERCENT. SO WHAT I'M SAYING WITH ALL OF THIS IS I'M NOT EXCITED ABOUT SUPPORTING THIS ONLY BECAUSE- IT IS SO LIMITED BUT I WILL SUPPORT IT AND I'M AND VERY HOPEFUL. IN FACT I BE PLEADING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TODAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT BILLS ARE IN THE WORKS RIGHT NOW OR OR ADVANCING- SERIOUSLY. BUT I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STEP UP AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY TO THE TENANTS WHICH WERE DOING. BUT ALSO THE LANDLORDS BECAUSE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GIVEN THE NEEDS THAT WE BUT HER PROXIMITY- ANYWHERE FROM FOUR FIVE BILLION OR EVEN MORE. THAT THIS WON'T BE ENOUGH IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR HOUSING STOCK AND HOUSING MARKETS. STABILIZE IN RECOVERS ACTIVELY SO WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS ITEM TODAY BUT WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE A CALIFORNIA COMPANION BILL TO SUPPLEMENT ON THIS- VERY FUNDING SOURCE. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM ARRIVED IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR NINETY. HUNDRED THAT THERE ARE- OURS NEEDS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CAN TO MINE AND A MONTH- TO MAKE SURE. THAT ALL OF ALL OF OUR RENTERS ARE PRETTY AND ABLE TO THE RIGHT THAT CLEARED- WE KNOW THAT WE THREE PENDING. BECAUSE THIS KIND IN THE AREA MASSIVE SIX INCREASING HOMELESS- AND HOW AND SO- NUMBER TWO. RENTER AKEEM MASSIVE MASS RENT THAT SO RENTED THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CLEAR AFTER THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER AND NUMBER THREE- SMALL LAMB GOING IN THE MASS FOR CLOSE- FOR NOT GET THE AND THAT THEY- THIS BILL- IT- ADDRESS ALL TO OF THOSE ISSUES IT KEEPS PEOPLE TABLE BY FELL. IT'S IT WILL ALLOW- MANY TENANTS TO CLEAR THEIR RENT THAT AND IT WILL ALLOW MANY WELL KNOWN- TO GET THE INCOME THAT THEY NEED AND NOT GO INTO FORECLOSURE- I DO WANT TO TESTING KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR ARM MANY PEOPLE IN THE RENTER COMMUNITY. WHO DO OF THAT I SHARE THAT. RENTERS NOT BE ABLE TO THE ACCESS- THE BULK OF THESE FOR THAT HAS TO BE BOB. PROTESTS BY LANDLORD- AND ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE ARE SO AND SO. FOR LANDLORDS TO. IS FINE. ARE HI I'M CAN THERE ARE SOME. WHO WON. BENEFIT FROM THE CLEARING OF THE ROAD THAT DIE AS A CAN. TO ME AND OTHERS- BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED WATCH THE AMPLE. OF THIS VERY VERY CARE I MAY US. AS NEEDED- ON STRONG BALANCE IS THE TO AND WILL PROTECT A LOT OF. AN I ASK FOR A AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATE WIENER SAID RUBIO. THANK YOU PRESIDENT. LADIES AND OF THE OTHER SENATE TODAY I RISE. TO PER OF ALL THANK OUR- AND ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN NEW. AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM FOR PRESENTING THIS IN MATTER. THIS IS A STEP TO PROVIDING. FOR WORSE. TO KEEP THEIR HOME. OUR COMMUNITY ARE EXPECT ALL OF US TO COME. AND STOP THE WAY THE THICK. THIS BILL TAKES ABOUT OF. TO ASSIST TEN WITH PETS TO READ. AS WELL AS- WHO'VE BEEN A IN FAITH. I'M THAT ALL OF US CAME TOGETHER THIS. YES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE REACH THE SUPREME. AND THAT AT ALL INCLUDES LEGALLY WHICH IS VITAL TO ALL OF CAN. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT PROVIDING RELIEF. IT IS EQUALLY AND THAT WE A SIXTY PLAN. TO DECEMBER AND GET PEOPLE THE GUY SAYING. S. THE BOTTOM STATED THAT STEP IS TO ENSURE THAT THIS PRO WORKS. R. O. ARE- X. FRUSTRATE. OVER THE GLITTER OF OTHER. AND ASSIST FROM SAN CLARA STE- AS LEAD. WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE SUPPORT WE PROVIDE IS TO. CULTURALLY SO. AND MULTI. AND SHOULD ALSO IN OKAY CENTER. SO THE OF FOR WE SIX. TO ALL THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE TAKEN A OR I. TO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE DOES. AND SUPPORT FOR BUSINESS AND RUN SPACE KOMMER EFFECTS. I HEARD TOO MANY STORIES OF MOM AND POP. READY TO GO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TO RUN AND ARE GETTING READY TO BE AFFECT. TELL ME THAT'S ON. INTO LAST AND CAL. I LOOK FOR TAKEN. TO SUPPORT WORK AND I URGE AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS I RIDE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MAY. I SO. TAKING MOMENT TO READ THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND OUR I STAND HERE BUT PARKS. SOCIALLY THROUGH THE CDC GUARD. NOT ALLOWED ON FLOOR UNTIL WE'RE- THIS IS TURN THIS UP SO DOWN IN EVERY WAY. AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO HELP. WE HAVE A SERIES OF ISSUES WHETHER IT'S OPENING THE SCHOOLS AND GETTING KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL OR GETTING BUSINESSES OPEN AND DEALING WITH ALL THE ECONOMIC DOWN TURNS THIS IS ONE OF MANY MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE FACE. WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AND AS THIS IS WRITTEN UNDER THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PUT TOGETHER TO OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THE FRAMEWORK. EMBODIED HERE X. IS THE FRAMEWORK LARGELY CREATED LAST YEAR'S RESULT OF EXTRAORDINARY NEGOTIATIONS AMONG ALL THE PARTIES PUTTING A LOT OF ELBOW GREASE INTO IT. THE QUESTION IS AS WAS MENTIONED WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THE DEBT NOBODY KNOWS. BUT THE ISSUE THAT WE FACE HERE JUST VERY BRIEFLY IS INACTION. INACTION MEANS THAT ON SUNDAY I THINK IT IS THE THIRTY FIRST IF THAT'S THE DATE THIS MORATORIUM GOES AWAY AS WRITTEN. IN OUR AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT WE'VE GOT TO EXTEND IT SO PEOPLE AREN'T THROWN OUT WE'VE GOT TO EXTEND IT SO THAT THE DEBT THE PEOPLE WERE TALKED ABOUT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THAT THE BALLOON PAYMENTS THAT WERE DUE ON THE THIRTY FIRST AND THAT HAVE BEEN EXTENDED. AND YOU KNOW IF WE LOOK AT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAYS THAT THE HISTORY THAT THE RIVER JUST AS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS PLENTY OF MONEY. EVEN IF IT'S LARGER NO ONE KNOWS AND SO AS FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING WELL IT'S NOT PERFECT WHAT I SAY IS THAT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE TO ACT AND WE HAVE TO ACT NOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE RESPONSIBILITY IS THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION MOVES FORWARD TO ACT ON BEHALF OF THE FOLKS IN. CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGING NEEDS AND THIS PUTS A LOT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR. PROPERTY OWNERS WHO MAY BE LOSING THEIR PROPERTIES A SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS ELIMINATES UNTIL AUGUST FIRST THE ABILITY OF ANY LANDLORD EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IN A PROCEEDING- AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO ALWAYS A REAR EDGES AND RUNS. AT IS THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBATES WHETHER IT SHOULD BE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN RELIEF PERSON BY PERSON AS A RESULT OF THIS DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING AFFORDED TODAY. WAS A LOT OF DETAILS IN IT I WANT TO THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER IN THE OTHER HOUSE FOR HER INVOLVEMENT IN HELPING CONVENE A WHOLE HOST OF FOLKS AT THE DIRECTION THE SPEAKER IN THE PROGRAM. AND ACID. YOU WILL IN FAVOR OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER HER. SENATOR- OTOBO. VERY GOOD WILL MOVE ON THIS NEWMAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM THAT I'D FIVE ONE TO. BE CLEAR I APPRECIATE THE REMARKS OF THE LEADER DEGREE ABOUT THE CON IN WHICH WE MAKE THIS. I WANT TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF THE COME OF MY CALL FROM SAN I CAN I WILL BE SERV THE BILL TODAY- BUT I CONTINUE TO HAVE CAN ABOUT APPARENT IN THE QUEUE IN THE OF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY THE SECTION REGARD REIMBURSE OF LAND FOR TO. WHO QUALIFY FOR A IT'S REALLY. AS I'M IN THE RECENT BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THIS TO THERE TO BE SICK LEVEL OF CAN. AROUND THE TERM OF THE REAR PAYMENT FOR. THE RALLY TEXT OF THE BILL READ QUOTE PROCESS FOR RENT ARREARS LYNNE TO COP OF EIGHTY PER. OF AN ELEGY HOUSEHOLD ON PAID RENTAL DE CAME FROM APRIL FIRST TWENTY TO THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY IN. PER ELIGIBLE HOUSE YEAH IN RESPONSE MY QUESTION INCOME WE WERE TO BY MANY FOR. THAT THE INTO OF THE IS TO FULLY REIMBURSE 80% SURE OF THE ARENA RIDGE ROAD HOWEVER IS MEMORIAL THE RELEVANT LANGUAGE NOT X. PROVIDE THAT ASSURE. TO LANDLORDS NOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHALL BE LIMITED TO AND SHALL BE THE IS FAR MORE THAN SEMANTIC IN THISCASE MANY RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS ARE JUSTIFIABLY CONCERNED THAT GIVEN THIS LANGUAGE AS WELL AS PAST EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT THEY MAY ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH AFFECTED TENANTS. ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THE ORIGINAL PERSON THEY RECEIVE WILL BE FAR LESS THAN THAT 80% WHICH IS THE UPPER LIMIT SPECIFIED IN THE LEGISLATION THE MOMENT NOW THAT PERSISTENCE OF THAT AMBIGUITY IS NO SMALL THING. IT'S GOING TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE WILLINGNESS OF LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE TOTAL AMOUNT NEEDED VERSUS THE TOTAL AMOUNT WILL HAVE AVAILABLE NOW THAT HESITANCY OR WORSE A DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE COULD POTENTIALLY DELAY OR PREVENT RELIEF TO TENANTS. WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED AND NEEDED NOW THE RELEASE IS ALSO. TO A LARGE NUMBER OF LAND. MANY OF WHOM ARE FOR FROM WEALTH. AND FIND ON INTENSE. AS WELL TO ME THE ROBERT. ON MORTGAGE. WELL ADEQUATELY. THE PROPERTY THEY RENT AND MANAGE AS THE PRO TO MENTION THE WORK WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE DETAILS ON THIS REPORT LEGISLATION.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HIGH USE IN SOME. OF AS FOR NOT ONE AND I WANT TO THANK MY CO. THAT I WORK RIGHT FROM- IN BEING- TO LEAD OFF. ON IT AB THIRTY EIGHTY LAST YEAR AND AS ALL. OF STATE THIS IS NOT A PER PIECE WHAT. BUT IT'S A NEED PIECE OF BLOOD. SPECIAL ANY STAR. IT'S A PIECE OF WHAT. THAT PROTECTS. NOT JUST A- BUT THE LAN. AS WELL AND I WAS COULD AND TO ME. BECAUSE MANY TIMES WE CONFUSE AND THINK THAT IF YOUR LANDLORD YOUR SOME WEALTHY INDIVIDUAL. BUT MNY OF THESE LANDLORDS ARE TEACHERS THERE ARE BUS DRIVERS THERE ARE MAIL CARRIERS. THERE ARE POLICE OFFICERS. AND SOME ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND THE JUSTICE MONDAY AS I PREPARING TO BE A PLANE AT ALL. I WAS APPROACHED BY ONE OF THESE POLICE OFFICERS. WHO HAPPENS OWN RENTAL PROPERTY. ANY STATED SOME OF HIS CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO. S. B. AB THIRTY EIGHTY BUT HE ALSO WAS GRATEFUL FOR THIS LEGISLATION. BUT HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT DESPITE THE REQUIREMENT OF SHOWING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT OF MAKING AT LEAST 25% OF THE RED SEA SOME OF HIS TENANTS HAD FAILED TO DO SO. N. AS HE STATED THE LAST THING THAT MANY OF THESE MOM AND POP OPERATORS WANT TO DO IS EVICT SOMEONE FROM THEIR APARTMENT MANY OF THESE FOLKS VIEW THESE PEOPLE AS FAMILY. MANY HAVE BEEN IN THEIR BUILDING FOR DECADES AND SO THAT'S THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO DO SO THIS HELPS THE SMALL LANDLORDS AS WELL AS TENANTS BECAUSE THE SMALL LANDLORDS HAVE BEEN CARRYING OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A RENT IN ARREARS. SINCE LAST SPRING AND THAT'S NO SMALL NUMBER. AND SO THIS HELPS ASSIST- THIS NEW MEASURE HOW ASSURE THAT THEY LEAVE WHAT WE A PER. OF THE DEATH TOLL TO THEM AND IT HELPS KEEP TENANTS HOW I MEAN AND THAT'S IN BECAUSE AS OUR LOW KEEP STATING IF THEY GOING TO FOR. NOT ONLY THEY LEAVE THEIR PROPERTY AND WILL NO LONGER BE HOLLOW SO WE HAVE A MORE WORK TO DO- TO THOSE ARE STRONG AND IT INCLUDES THOSE WHO MAY NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE THIS. THERE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF MANY FOLKS MIGHT NOT QUALIFY SO AND BUT THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING IN HIGH COST AREAS ON THE LAST- THIS IS A GOOD AGREEMENT AND IT'S THE RIGHT ACTION FOR THE MOMENT. I SUPPORT IT ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR PRO TEM FOR HER EXCELLENT LEADERSHIP. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND I TRUST THAT WE GET TO WERE OUT AS STATED BY MANY OF OUR-COLLEAGUES TO EDUCATE. THE PUBLIC BOTH THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AND IT GETS THE PEOPLE THAT THEY- NEED SO. ON THAT NOTE I STRONGLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

SENATE PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE YEAH. I WOULD THE- LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AND TO YOUR CONCERN. A CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN LEFT TO CREATE A THIRD PARTY TO ADMINISTER THE COLORED. DISSEMINATION OF ACTIONS. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THE LACK OF ACCESS. FOR US TO REVIEW THE CONTRACT THE PROVISION IN THE CONTRACT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND PUT TO MANY YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS MADE CONTRACTS WITH MAJOR SUPPLIERS PARTICULARLY HIGH TECH SUPPLIERS. THAT HAVE COST US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOT COME IN ON TIME AND HAVE CRASHED AND BURNED. SO I AM CONCERNED OF THE PROVISIONS I HAD NO MISTRUST OF THOSE WHO APPARENTLY HAVE RECEIVED THE APPROVAL OF THE CONTRACT. BUT SUFFICE TO SAY IT IS CERTAINLY BEEN A RUSH DEAL. WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PLACED FOR THIS OR NOT WHAT WAS THE EXPECTATION AND THE CURRENT CRITERIA PUT FORTH BY THE STATE TO THE APPLICANTS FOR THE CONTRACTS. AND WHAT WERE OF THE FINAL PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT TO ASSURE THAT THE STATE. IS LEGALLY PROTECTED SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OF THAT TO BE AWARE I HAVE A QUESTION OR FACT DEMANDED. THAT CONTRACT TO THE REVIEW THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON MEMBERS AS YOU EXIT THE FLOOR. IF THERE IS NO OTHER BUSINESS CENTER AT THE DESK IS CLEAR. THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR COMMENTS TODAY FLOOR SESSION- THE NEXT ONE IS SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT TWO PM.
