I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE STEPPING UP TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH FOOD PANTRIES HOUSING RELATED EFFORTS AND OTHER SERVICES AND RESOURCES. HOWEVER FINDING THESE RESOURCES OFTEN INCLUDES NAVIGATING DISCONNECTED SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR STUDENTS THEREFORE EIGHTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO MY AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT FROM LAST YEAR WOULD PROVIDE A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO MEET STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS BY ESTABLISHING A BASIC NEEDS CENTER AND A BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR. ON EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS NO LATER THAN JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR WOULD ACT AS A BROKER AND IDENTIFYING SUPPORTING AND LINKING STUDENTS. TO ON AND OFF CAMPUS SERVICES AND RESOURCES. THE BASIC NEEDS CENTER IS INTENDED TO BE A ONE STOP CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR STUDENTS TO MORE EASILY ACCESS CAN AWARENESS BE CONNECTED TO EXISTING SERVICES AND RESOURCES. UNDER THIS BILL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD ALSO DEVELOP A DOCUMENT THAT CLEARLY LISTS ALL ON AND OFF CAMPUS BASIC NEEDS SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT THE CENTER. AS WELL AS ON THE CAMPUSES WEBSITE IN STUDENT PORTAL. THE IDEA OF A COORDINATED AND INTEGRATED APPROACH IS NOT NEW IN FACT FIFTY NINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE REPORTED HAVING SOME FORM OF BASIC NEEDS ENTER ALREADY. DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED AND CHALLENGING TIMES COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES NEED OUR SUPPORT NOW MORE THAN EVER AND BECAUSE OF THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE CLEAR THAT CHILD CARE IS THE SPECIAL FOR WORKING FAMILIES YEAH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THE MOST VULNERABLE REPORT DIFFICULTY FINDING CARE LEADING THREE QUARTERS OF MOTHERS AND HALF OF FATHERS BELIEVER SWITCHED TO A LESS DEMANDING JOB SINCE THE PANDEMIC THREE MILLION WOMEN NATIONWIDE HAVE LEFT THE WORKFORCE DUE TO CHILD CARE SHORTAGES DRIVING PARTICIPATION TO A THIRTY THREE YEAR LOW AND LEAVING 40% OF BUSINESSES UNABLE TO FILL VACANCIES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWO THIRTY THREE WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS APPLYING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF THE MISSION REGARDLESS OF THEIR WEALTH AND FAMILY CONNECTIONS AS A PROUD UC BERKELEY ALARM GO BEARS. I WAS SADDENED TO HEAR THE UC CAMPUS STUFF WERE IMPLICATED IN THE COLLEGE EMISSIONS FRAUD DISCOVERED BY THE F. B. I.'S TWENTY NINETEEN OPERATION VARSITY BLUES INVESTIGATION. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONDED BY APPROVING AN INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL AUDIT TO INVESTIGATE UC ADMISSIONS PROCESS THESE THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT WERE RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND THEY DEMONSTRATE ONGOING ON LONG STANDING FLAWS IN CAMPUSES CAMPUS PROPHECIES THE CREATED UNFAIR OR INCONSISTENT EMISSION PRACTICES. ARE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT SOME UC CAMPUSES STUFF EXPLOITED LOOPHOLES IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS TO EMIT SIXTY FOUR UNDER QUALIFIED STUDENTS AS FAVORS TO DONORS FAMILIES FRIENDS BETWEEN THE ACADEMIC YEARS OF TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THESE UNDER QUALIFIED IN IMPROPERLY OMITTED STUDENTS. SKEWED WEALTHY WHITE. A FURTHER APPLICATION REVIEWERS WERE SOMETIMES OVERLY HARSH OR OVERLY LENIENT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE APPLICANTS WHICH MEANS APPLICANT'S. CHANCES OF EMISSIONS UNDULY DEPENDENT ON WHICH STAFF MEMBERS EVALUATED THE APPLICATIONS. WE NEED TO ASSURE CALIFORNIANS THE DIVERSITY AND MERITOCRACY WE VALUE IS RETAINED IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. AB TWO THIRTY THREE IS ALIGNED WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SYSTEM WIDE PROTOCOLS TRAINING AND OVERSIGHT ACROSS ALL UC CAMPUSES TO PREVENT AGAINST IMPROPER INCREASES THE MISSION. AB TWO THIRTY THREE WOULD REQUEST THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO ESTABLISH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL EMISSIONS PROCESS. INCLUDING TRAINING FOR APPLICATION REVIEWERS ON THE CONSISTENT AND UNBIASED USE OF EMISSION CRITERIA. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW EACH CAMPUS IS IMPLEMENTING THESE PROCEDURES AND WHAT MEASURES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO PREVENT INAPPROPRIATE INTERACTION BETWEEN A MISSION STAFF AND OTHER UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS. ALL STUDENTS APPLYING TO THE UC UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF THE MISSION. WE MUST ENSURE THAT YOU SEE EMISSIONS PROCESSES LIVE UP TO THE CALIBER OF OUR STUDENTS APPLYING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR BY THE- WITH ME TODAY IS WITNESSES. I HAVE BOB HARRIS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ALLEN CALDERON THE EXTERNAL VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UC IRVINE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN THE FIRSTLY WITNESS FROM THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM BOB HARRIS PRINCIPAL AUDITOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE MISTER HARRIS PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOB HARRIS FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER ON OUR REVIEW OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS PROCESSES. IF THE POLICY OF OUR OFFICE NOT TO TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON BILLS BUT I WOULD PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW EIGHTY TWO THIRTY THREE. ADDRESSES THE DEFICIENCIES WE FOUND DURING OUR REVIEW IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AND ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO SOLVE THOSE DEFICIENCIES. ALSO BY WAY OF UPDATE TO THE COMMITTEE WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED OUR SIX MONTH UPDATE ON THE UNIVERSITY'S PROGRESS ON OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE UNIVERSITY STILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THAT IT NEEDS TO MAKE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FOUND. NO AB TWO THIRTY THREE ADDRESSES QUITE A NUMBER OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES AND ADOPTS MANY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I'LL HIGHLIGHT TO FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS AS NEEDED. ONE OF FOCUS FIRST ON THE AREA APPLICANT EVALUATION WHERE AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST MENTIONED. WE FOUND THAT AN APPLICANT'S CHANCES OF GETTING A HIGH SCORE OR A LOW SCORE ON THEIR APPLICATION WERE UNDULY DUE TO. WHICH APPLICATION REVIEW WHERE THEY HAPPEN TO BE ASSIGNED TO. THAT LOOKS ALTADENA INCONSISTENT AND UNFAIR PROCESS FOR APPLICANT EVALUATION BECAUSE THE CAMPUS HAS HAD NOT ADOPTED MONITORING PROCESSES. TO ENSURE PROFICIENCY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE APPLICATION CYCLE AND OUR SIX MONTH REVIEW SHOWS THAT SEVERAL CAMPUSES ARE STILL BEHIND IN THAT AREA THEY HAVE NOT ADOPTED SUFFICIENT. SOLUTIONS TO THAT PROBLEM. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. SECOND ISSUE ALL COVER FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS AS THE AREA APPLICANTS SELECTION. WE FOUND AT UCLA AND UC BERKELEY THE CAMPUSES LACKED CLEAR METHODOLOGIES FOR WHY THEY WOULD DECIDE AMONGST A VERY COMPETITIVE POOL OF APPLICANTS TO CHOOSE ONE APPLICANT OVER ANOTHER. LEAVING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THEY WOULD CHOOSE THE LOWER RATED APPLICANTS OVER HIGHER RATED APPLICANTS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE SAW. AGAIN WE RECOMMEND THE CAMPUSES ADOPT CLEAR METHODOLOGIES FOR THE CHOOSING AMONGST THEIR HIGHLY COMPETITIVE POOLS BUT THE UNIVERSITY IS STILL BEHIND IN THAT AREA. WITH THAT I'LL TAKE ANY OF THE COMMITTEES QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THE SECOND LEAD WITNESS- CALLING IN IT IS MISTER ALLEN CALDERON THE EXTERNAL VICE PRESIDENT OF ASSOCIATED STUDENTS AT UC IRVINE MISTER CALDERON PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN CONTENT ON A STUDENT AND% EXTERNAL VICE PRESIDENT AT UC IRVINE. I'D LIKE TO SET TO START OFF BY THINKING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BOERNER HORVATH AND MCCARTY FOR BRINGING THIS BILL TO THE ASSEMBLY. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS ARE STRESSFUL FOR EVERYONE I KNOW YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY'LL BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE FOR THEIR STUDENTS SOME HAVE TO-WORRY ABOUT WHETHER THEY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. STUDENTS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR GPA FROM THE START OF THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR STANDARDIZED TESTING IS BOTH EXPENSIVE AND NOT ACTUALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF EACH STUDENT'S ABILITY TO HANDLE A COLLEGE CURRICULUM TO WORRY ABOUT THE COST OF APPLICATIONS WHAT OUR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE WILL LOOK LIKE. AND THE FEAR OF REJECTION. AND FOR SOME THE STORIES ARE MARGINAL. THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN AFFORD ALL OF THESE THINGS. FOR SOME IT IS EASY IS WRITING A CHECKS AND OUT OF THE BOX THAT SHOULD CONCERN EVERY PERSON ON THIS COMMITTEE. EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE A FAIR CHANCE IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS. WE SHOULD NOT BE PRAYING TO GET LUCKY WITH AN APPLICATION REVIEW WORK WILL DO THEIR JOB IMPARTIAL IMPARTIALLY. THE PRESTIGE OF THE UC IS CONTINGENT UPON A STRICTER FORM OF THIS PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR UNIVERSITY ARE THOSE WHO TRULY WORKS FOR IT- YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH MONEY YOUR FAMILY HAS. SHOULD NEVER BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN ADMISSIONS. BY CONTINUING TO ALLOW THESE UNFAIR PRACTICES IN ADMISSIONS THE UC WILL BECOME KNOWN MORE FOR HOW IT BENDS THE RULES FOR SOME STUDENTS. BUT MAKES THE REST OF US JUMP JUMP THROUGH HOOPS. NUMBERS OUT OF RESPECT FOR OUR STUDENTS AND ALL THE HARD WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE YES ON. EIGHTY TWO THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU.

UNIVERSALLY ALTERNATELY HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ASSURING THAT ANY FURTHER CHANGES PROPOSED TO OUR ADMISSIONS PROCEDURES. DO NOT IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN A BROAD AND ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF APPLICANTS- THAT WE DO NOT ADDITION TO SHARE TODAY AGAIN THE UNIVERSALIST WORKER DISCUSSIONS OF THE AUTHORS. AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUAL CASES. OUTLINED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WILL NOW GO QUESTIONS OR CRIME FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY MAKE A MOTION AND A NO LIKE TO A CAR I AM THREE THE AUTHOR FOR THE B. UP TO THIRTY THREE WHICH IS ATTEMPTING TO- COME UP WITH A MORE- FAIR AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL ADMISSION STANDARDS OF WAR PRACTICES- BECAUSE SELF OFF SCANDALS THAT WE HAD. NEVER HEARD OF HIM AND ALSO- TO DATE MY AB TWO FIFTY ONE WAS A RELATED TO WITH THIS SO FAIR AND EQUITABLE THE COMMISSION PRACTICES SET OF STANDARDS SO- THAT THE DISORDER OR BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A WOULD BE OF GREAT HELP WITH THAT. I MAKE A MOTION FOR APPROVAL. WE HAVE A REMOTE BY CHOI AS BY DOCTOR RUMBLE. BUT OUR LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING. I'M SORRY MISTER BENNETT DID NOT SEE MY PLAN. THE SEE THANK YOU MR LEVINE I APPRECIATE X. AND EFFICIENCY- BY WHICH YOU'RE YOU'RE CHAIRING THE MEETING MISTER FERRELL I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE HE THE AUDITOR- AND- I I'D LOSE IT MISTER HARRIS WHO IS THERE HE'S HE'S STILL THERE- AND WHILE WE'RE WAITING- TO CALL HIM UP- I DID WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. HER EFFORT TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A REAL ISSUE WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ADMITTED BASED ON THEIR MERIT TEND NOT TO ON ANY UNSEEMLY- INFLUENCE THAT TIME COULD BE WEIGHED DOWN ON ON THE UNIVERSITY AS WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT SCANDAL- SAYS. MR HARRIS'S THERE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M HERE RIGHT THANK YOU- SO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT- KNOW YOU THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND I AM REPRESENTING THE WORK OF THE AUDIT AND THE AUDITOR- IN YOUR EFFORT ON ALL OF THIS. WHEN I AM I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL LANGUAGE IT DOES APPEAR TO ME TO BE. A QUITE PRESCRIPTIVE AND I THINK WE'LL SEE THE SENATE AND WHAT I SEE IS A COMPANION BILL FOR CSU LATER ON- AND- IT IN INTO PLACE ALL ADDRESS THE FIRST ONE THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE. WHICH IS THE REQUIREMENT. BUT WHAT WHICH I SUPPORT IN IN- IN SPIRIT. ABOUT REPORTING ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD HAVE- A LEVER WAY DOWN UPON THEM TO ADMIT. OR DECLINE A STUDENT FOR THAT MATTER- BECAUSE OF THAT TYPE OF INFLUENCE THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A STAFF MEMBER AT AT YOU SEE- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE AND HOW IT IS WRITTEN IN THE BILL AND SO I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE AUDITORS- RECOMMENDATIONS. AND IN THIS WILL REFLECT ON MY SECOND QUESTION- SO FOR EXAMPLE- STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN WAIT LISTED OFTEN ARE RECOMMENDED WRITE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY. THE SAME THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GO THERE AND THAT IS THE ONLY UNIVERSITY YOU WANT TO GO TO AND IF YOU ARE TAKEN OFF THAT WAIT LIST THAT THAT IS YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THAT OFFER TO GO. ON AND THAT IF SOMEONE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT LETTER AND THEN LET'S JUST SAY IT'S THE DEAN- AND THEN ASK WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE OF THE WEIGHT LAST- HEY WHERE IS. MISTER HARRIS ON THE WAIT LIST I GOT THIS LETTER IT WAS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE ANYWHERE NEAR THE TOP- WHAT IS THAT YOU KNOW DOES THAT FALL INTO THAT HAVE INFLOWS BECAUSE THE DEAN IS AN INFLUENTIAL MEMBER OF THE STAFF. OF THE LEADER OF PERHAPS- EACH ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE UNIVERSITY WHERE DOES NOT FALL AND HOW DOES THAT WORK. HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THERE THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT- ELEMENTS- QUESTION I WANNA MAKE SURE ADDRESS ONE IS. THE ISSUE OF LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION. THE UNIVERSITY HAS FORMAL POLICIES ABOUT WHEN LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION FOR APPLICANTS ARE APPROPRIATE AND NOT APPROPRIATE. SO THE UNIVERSITY DOES HAVE A STAFF OF PRACTICES THAT DEFINE WHEN A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION IS. IF YOU WILL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF AN APPROPRIATE- ADMISSIONS ASSESSMENT. AND WHEN IT IS NOT. SO THERE'S PRETTY CLEAR INSTRUCTION ALREADY WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TO DO WITH A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION NOW. WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIT LIST ISSUE. WE DID SEE THAT SORT OF ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING DURING OUR UP AT- IT IS IT IS GENERALLY OUTSIDE OF THE PRESCRIBED. ALLOWABLE USE OF LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION- SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT ADMISSIONS OFFICES DUE TO THE RELATIVELY CALM IN NATURE OF THOSE. CORRESPONDENTS WOULD HAVE. A STANDARDIZED RESPONSES TO. THOSE LETTERS AND OTHER WORDS SAYING THAT THOSE ARE NOT INFLUENTIAL AND DO NOT ARE NOT CONSIDERED ON. AS PART OF THE ADMISSIONS REVIEW PROCESS SO WHAT DOES BE REPORTABLE EVENTS UNDER- THE BILL'S PROVISIONS- THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THE UNIVERSITY PROBABLY HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ON IN TERMS OF- DELINEATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT STAFF MIGHT RECEIVE IN THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY SHOULD HANDLE. I SUCH A BIT OF A GRAY AREA SO IT SAYS THAT ALL. ALL THINGS SHOULD BE REPORTED BUT THEY MAY HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH IT SAYS IF YOU RECEIVE A LETTER FROM AN APPLICANT- POST. DECISION BUT PRE CLOSURE BECAUSE OF A WEIGHTLESS SETTING EXPRESSES THEIR INTEREST YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SAY I GOT THIS LETTER- WHERE IS THIS STUDENT OR BUSINESS PERSON HAVE A PRAYER IT WAS IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE LETTER OR OR NOT FOR THAT MATTER. THEY CAN CREATE THEIR OWN POLICY AROUND. THE TICKET CREATE THEIR OWN POLICY FOR HOW TO REPORT THAT THE LETTER WAS RECEIVED A COMMUNIQUE. BETWEEN THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE AND OTHERS ABOUT. WHERE IN THE RANKING A STUDENT MAY LIE. OUR TRICKY BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON WHO THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE IS SPEAKING WITH THEY MAY BE SPEAKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON CAMPUS THAT HAS A ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN DECIDING WHICH STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED SO CERTAIN MAJORS DO A SUPPLEMENTAL REVIEW OF OTHER APPLICANTS TO THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY PARTICIPANTS IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE AND ONE OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY FALL INTO A DANGEROUS ZONE BUT THERE MAY BE OTHER PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WHO RECEIVE THOSE CORRESPONDENTS FOR WHICH IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH SURE AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT BEING FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE SENT SOMETHING THERE THAT- IS NOT IN. IN KIND OF A- SO THAT WE WOULD THINK OF AS A MERITED- WAY OF EXPRESSING INTEREST OR OR QUALITIES THAT WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE. BEEN IN THE PROGRAM- I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR JUST THE ENTIRETY OF THE WORK OF THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AN EXHAUSTIVE APPROACH THAT YOU HAVE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE ABOUT- HOW THE SUPPLIES IN THIS INSTANCE. IS DID YOU USE- OTHER UNIVERSITY MODELS FOR. DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE DID YOU LOOK OUTSIDE THE UC SYSTEM FOR WHAT AND WHAT IN APPROACH SHOULD BE FOR THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS WHETHER IT WOULD BE. A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM LIKE YOU SEE LIKE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN OR OR SUNY- OR EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE- INSTANCES LIKE THIS WAY AND THAT AS WELL. SO AS PART OF ANY OUT OF IF YOU WERE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES IN THE FIELD THAT WE REVIEW. THERE ARE NONE THAT WE SPECIFICALLY REFER TO AN ARMADA AS THE CRITERIA BY WHICH WE ASSESS THE UC. WHAT WE WERE REFERRING TO MOSTLY WHERE THE UC'S PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS FOR IT WHAT APPROPRIATE EMISSIONS ACTIVITY WAS AND THEN A REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. PRINCIPLES AND ETHICS ARE ADHERED TO AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAW THE GAPS. AND IT'S WORTH NOTING TO THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T DISAGREE WITH THE- THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MAKING IN OTHER WORDS THAT CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD JUST NOT BE OCCURRING AS PART OF THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS YEAH THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THAT SO YOU SEE ON THE BROADEST POLICY LEVEL. HAS IT RIGHT IT WAS IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND- ADHERENCE TO THOSE STANDARDS THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE NEW POLICIES TO BE A BIT MORE GRANULAR AND HOW YOU SEE FOLLOWS THOSE. BROADER POLICIES. CORRECT WE FIND NO FAULT WITH THE OVERALL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES THAT THE UNIVERSITY ESPOUSES THOSE ARE THE RIGHT- NORTH STAR TO FOLLOW BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THEY WERE FALLING DOWN ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND FOLLOW THROUGH OF THOSE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HARRIS. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY DOCTOR CHOI. FOR A SECOND I'M SORRY THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE YES I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER NIVEAU. YEAH MOTION BY DOCTOR CHOICE SECONDS AYE DR RUMBLE US I COMMENDED AUTHOR FOR HER DESIRE TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THE UC ADMISSION PROCESS AND I APPRECIATE HER WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH MY STAFF.

BARBEL TERROR BUT ENOUGH BY CHURCHILL A AND MEMBERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC HOW YOU MIGHT BE AND I AM REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION AFFILIATE OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE HONORED TO SPONSOR AB TWELVE SIXTY NINE AND A FATHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR TAKING ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF PARITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. PART TIME FACULTY COMPRISED 70% A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY AND TEACHER APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE CLASS OF. THIS HAS CREATED A DYNAMIC IN WHICH THE FACULTY THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SERVING THE MOST BY FIRST AND LARGEST STUDENT BODY IN THE WORLD ARE NOT GIVEN THE RESPECT AND TOOLS TO POLICE FOR THEIR STUDENTS. THE LACK OF PARITY IN REGARDS TO PAY OFFICE HOURS SHARED GOVERNANCE AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER FACTORS. HAVE LED TO OUR PART TIME FACULTY BEING EXPLOITEDAND USED AS A COST SAVINGS MEASURE. THE POINT ASIAN HARM ARE PART TIME FACULTY AND OUR INSTITUTIONS. BUT A TENTATIVE OUR STUDENTS FAR MORE AT THE END LIMITED ACCESS TO PART TIME FACULTY WHO ARE WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS TO EARN A LIVING. AND YOUR NOT COMPENSATED SUFFICIENTLY OR AT ALL OUR OFFICE HOURS TO MEET WITH STUDENTS. MOST PART TIME. ARE NOT PROVIDED ADEQUATE SPACE ON CAMPUS. THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SHARED GOVERNANCE WORK THAT INFORMS THE COLLEGES DECISIONS AND CURRICULUM. AND THEY ARE OFTEN NOT COMPENSATED FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER TRAININGS REQUIRED BY THE STATE AND FOR ACCREDITATION. THE STATUS QUO HURT PART TIME FACULTY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN STUDENTS ARE STRESSFUL WITH THE CLEAN THEIR CAMPUSES BY PROFESSORS WHO HAVE CONSISTENT OFFICE HOURS OFFICE SPACE AND INVOLVEMENT IN SHARED GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES AND OUR OVERALL PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE COLLEGE THOSE STUDENTS PERFORM BETTER IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. AB TWELVE FIFTY NINE WOULD CREATE PARITY FOR PART TIME FACULTY OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT PEOPLE WORK RESULTS IN EQUAL PAY AND WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO OUR STUDENTS.

UNEMPLOYED UNDER EMPLOYED ADULT STUDENT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A GRAND CAL IS OUT RIGHT WITH NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS D. SEVEN TO DISTRICT COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ALREADY OFFERS SIGNIFICANT ONLINE PROGRAMS STUDENT. EVEN WELL BEFORE THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE OF THAT CALIFORNIA VIRTUAL CAMPUS THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AMONG THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES OFFERING ROBUST TO HIGH QUALITY ONLINE COURSES. ADDITIONALLY THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT- CONTINUING EDUCATION TO BE LAUNCHED I KIND OF HAD TO ME WHICH IS COMPLETELY FREE FULLY ONLINE AND- FULLY COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUILT TO SERVE A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT- SO DECIDED EXAMPLES AND HOWEVER WE'VE SEEN- SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND ABOUT. ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER CLIENT INTENDED ON GOING FINE- MEN. TEN MILLION DOLLAR IN A LONG PLAN- FOR CALIBRATE WHICH AN- HAS FAILED TO REACH GOLD BINGE AND WATER INTO CLICK IF ALL. ALREADY BIGELOW THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND DIRECT VIOLATION OF A LAW- ADDITIONALLY AFTER ABOUT THREE YEARS OF OPERATION REPEATING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDS. ACCOUNT RIGHT IT'S ONLY ISSUE ABOUT THIRTY THREE CERTIFICATE TWENTY NINE TO BE DIVORCED MEANWHILE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WITH ABOUT TWO MILLION STUDENTS MOVE COMPLETELY ONLINE OR ALMOST COMPLETELY ONLINE GRECO THE NINETEEN. MAKING CLEAR THAT MANY OF THE COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ONLINE COURSES AND PROGRAMS YEAH AND THEN- THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT OF OUR LIMITED STATE FUNDING FOR THIS BILL EXPERIMENT CAL BRIGHT.

MS BROWN. WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE PROCEED. THE MORNING H. AND COMMITTEE MEMBER MY IS WENDY A ONE COOP AND I'M JUST. OF THE FACT THAT THE- OF THE CAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND A- AT CALL OF THE- I'M ASKING FOR THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO WHICH WOULD. WHICH WOULD MAKE CALIBRATION OPERATIVE AT THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN I SAT BEFORE THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. AND SHARED FACT CONCERN ABOUT THE NEWLY PROPOSED FULLY ONLINE COLLEGE. THANKS FACT TIME THE STATE HAS A LOT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION IN FUNDING TO THE COLLEGE WITH LITTLE TO SHOW FOR IT. CALIBRATE HAS SPENT THREE YEARS AND APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO WARD TWENTY NINE STUDENTS. WITH THIRTY FIVE CREDENTIALS. PARKING CHARACTER LAST YEAR COLLEGE OF THE CAN HAD A J. FUND BUDGET OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR MILLION. WE SERVED OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS. AWARDED OVER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CERTIFICATE AND THREE THOUSAND DEGREES. THOUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY RESOURCEFUL AND HELPING STUDENTS SUCCEED. ONE CALBERT WAS CREATED THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATED THAT IT PROGRAM NOT DUPLICATE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE EXISTING COLLEGES. CURRENTLY CALIBRATE POPPERS MEDICAL CODING CYBER SECURITY HI HE SEE OUR AND BUT YOU'RE ALSO OFFERED AT MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS. FURTHERMORE THE MEDICAL CODING PATHWAY CALIBRATE THE NAGO PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CLOSED TO NEW ENROLLMENT SINCE JULY TWENTY TWENTY UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE NEW STUDENT. TO REACH ADULT MEN OF COLOR IN FACT ALMOST 70% OF OUR TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS ARE PEOPLE OF DIVERSE ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND JUST LESS THAN HALF OF ALL STUDENTS ARE MALE. OVER 40% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE WORKING ADULTS TWENTY FIVE OR OLDER. CHILD RIGHT FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE SIMILAR IN BACKGROUND BUT SLIGHTLY LESS ETHNICALLY DIVERSE. ANOTHER FALSE PREMISE WAS THAT OUR STUDENTS IT OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT OFFER COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. HOWEVER BEFORE THE CREATION OF CALIBRATE MOST OF OUR COLLEGES OFFERED OFFERED COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. AND MANY OF THE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS ARE NOW ONLINE. CAN CALIBRATE IS NEITHER UNIQUE NOR PROGRESSIVE. INSTEAD IT IS AN OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE UNACCREDITED EXPERIMENT THEY CONTINUE TO VIOLATE STATUTES AND SAILORS DIDN'T. WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AB FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. TURNING NOW TO THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM WE HAVE THE FIRST LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO AB FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO A G. TO TELL WALKER MEN AND PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CONRAD COLLEGE. PRESIDENT TALL WALKER MEN AND PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MEDINA TELECOM AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I AM A LIFELONG ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN CALIBRATING ADDITION AND I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE AB FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO WHICH WOULD END OUR WORK TO INCREASE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIANS WORKING ADULTS. I'D REFER YOU TO MY LETTER FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE ON OUR PROGRESS BUT IN SHORT HELP RIGHT HAS MET EVERY STATUTORY MILESTONE LAID OUT IN OUR FOUNDING LEGISLATION AND IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TOWARD OUR MISSION. TODAY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT NOT FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS BEARING THE BRUNT OF THIS PANDEMIC. NAVIGATING AN ECONOMIC RECESSION AND FACING YET ANOTHER RECOVERY THAT WE'VE BEEN STRANDED WITHOUT A PATH INTO GOOD JOBS IN THE NEW ECONOMY. I WAS WORKING WITH GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN HE REACHED A DEAL WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A SEVEN YEAR START UP TIMELINE FOR COLLEGE THAT COULD BE A PUBLIC ALTERNATIVES TO PREDATORY FOR PROFIT. BUT I LIKE TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THIS COMMITTEE THIS WORK IS NO LONGER THEORETICAL. CALVERT HAS FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS BUT WE'RE ON A GROWTH TRAJECTORY TO SERVE FIVE THOUSAND IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. OUR STUDENTS REFLECT THE STATE'S TREMENDOUS RACIAL DIVERSITY AND MORE THAN 90% ARE ADULTS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. THEY ARE EXACTLY THE PEOPLE CALVERT WAS CREATED TO SERVE. AND THE PANDEMIC'S DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON BLACK LET NEXT INDIGENOUS CALIFORNIANS. AND AS WELL AS WOMEN IN REAL RESIDENTS HAVE ONLY MADE A WORKING URGENT. IT IS CLEAR HOW THE STORY GOES HISTORICALLY. AS ECONOMY BEGINS TO OPEN UP. UNCERTAINTY LINGERS. PREDATORY FOR PROFIT SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TARGET RECRUIT AND LEAVE BEHIND STUDENTS IN THE SAME COMMUNITIES. WE CAN AGREE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING OVERWHELMING ABOUT THIS MOMENT. AND WE MUST HAVE A TO DO MORE TO SERVE THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. NOT LESS. CALVET IS DESIGNING FLEXIBLE PATHWAYS TO IN DEMAND JOBS FOR THESE CALIFORNIANS BUT IMPORTANTLY. WE ALSO ACT AS A RESOURCE FOR THE SYSTEM. TO RESEARCH AND EXPAND THE IMPACT OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES. AS GOVERNOR NEWSOM MADE CLEAR IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE MUST BE COMMITTED TO AN EQUITABLE BROAD BASED ECONOMIC RECOVERY WILL ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR DREAMS. BUT TO MAKE THIS VISION A REALITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION WE MUST LEARN FROM PAST CRISES. SO I WANT TO CLOSE MY ADVOCATING FOR OUR STUDENTS. HECTOR LISTEN SAN PEDRO AND HE'S IN OUR I. T. SUPPORT PROGRAM. WITH THE HELP OF THE CALVERT CAREER COACH HE UPDATED HIS RESUME. HE WAS OFFERED A JOB AT A ROBOTICS COMPANY WHEN HIRING MANAGER NOTED HE WAS IN A CALVET. INDUSTRY RECOGNIZED TRAINING PROGRAM. FLORENCE COMPLETED. MEDICAL CO PROGRAM JULY. UNDERSERVED IT'S A- AND WAS HIRED AS A MEDICAL CODER IN SANTA NOT HOFFA AND- MONICA IS A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE BORN AND RAISED IN SACRAMENTO. SHE HAS THE PASSION TO FIX THINGS BUT NO BACKGROUND IN TECHNOLOGY SHE'S TRIED ONLINE FOR PROFIT PROGRAMS THE WITHOUT SUCCESS. TODAY MONICA IS IN OUR I. T. PROGRAM PURSUING A MORE STABLE FUTURE FOR HER FAMILY. SHE SAID OF CALIBRATE QUOTE I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO COME TO CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS GOING TO CALIBRATE FUTURE. THAT HELP FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS IS OUR NORTH STAR AND I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO ALLOW US TO CARRY FORWARD SO WE DON'T THINK STUDENTS LIKE THIS BEHIND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WALKER MAN IN THOSE BLASTS LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO IS M. A HAYNES. PRESIDENT OF THE CALIBRATE COLLEGE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

I'M PAM HAYNES PRESIDENT OF THE CLUB RIGHT BOARD OF TRUSTEES THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU TODAY. I AM A TWENTY TWO YEAR VETERAN TRUSTEE. AND ALSO SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS. BUT THE BUT MORE IMPORTANT TO THIS CONVERSATION I AM A CALIFORNIAN WHO BENEFIT FROM WORKFORCE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AT A TIME WHEN INDUSTRY WAS CHANGING. DECADES AGO PROGRAMS LIKE THESE GAVE ME THE TRAINING I NEEDED TO LAND A JOB THAT HAD BENEFITS. PAID A LIVING WAGE AND ALLOWED ME TO FURTHER MY EDUCATION AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO UCLA. TODAY CALIBRATE IS A LIVING BREATHING COLLEGE WITH APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES INCLUDING FACULTY REPRESENTED BY THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. AS A STATE WIDE COLLEGE CALIBRATE IS ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE REGIONS OF THE STATE WITH THE MOST NEED WORKING CLOSELY WITH WORKFORCE BOARDS IN FRESNO ST BERNARD DINO SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND SENATE BILL TO OFFER IN DEMAND TRAINING. AB RIGHT IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND BAKERSFIELD COMPTON AND COSTA MESA TO DEVELOP TEST AND IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE SKILL BASED STRATEGIES. A FOR ECONOMICALLY DISCONNECTED ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I MIGHT ADD THAT THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE DEEPLY INVESTED IN KELP AND CALIBRATES MISSION AND IT'S IT IS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT. BY MAKING CALIBRATED OPERATIVE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD TAKE AWAY A CRITICAL TOOL NOT JUST FROM CALIFORNIA FOR THE FOURTH- FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEM BUT FROM OUR STATE AND OUR STUDENTS AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED MORE EDUCATIONAL UP OPTIONS. AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES NOT LESS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MS HAINES WE WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

YOU KNOW WE TOOK SWIFT ACTION TWO YEARS AGO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE TO TIGHTEN UP THE ADMISSIONS BY ACCEPTANCE BURKE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL WE HAD SOME WORK THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL- THIS IS REALLY FOLLOW UP BECAUSE THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THERE WERE SOME OTHER- SHORTCOMINGS IN THE UC ADMISSIONS PROCESS- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERSTAND. THEIR CONCERNS BUT WE THINK THIS IS A FAIR COMPROMISE WE HAVE HERE AND THEN RECENT AMENDMENT AS FAR AS- THE SCOPE OF THE OVERSIGHT AUDITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BUT THE BIG PICTURE HERE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT- DONATIONS AND PERSONAL CONNECTIONS ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN ADMISSIONS DECISIONS. REQUIRE YOU SEE CAMPUS TO REPORT ON THE REST LEFT ATHLETIC EMISSIONS PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT FRAUD OF COURSE YOU HAD A FEW PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO BE COLLEGE ATHLETES AND GOT IN THROUGH FRAUDULENT MEANS THERE WAS NO FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE ON THE SPORTS TEAMS AND IF THEY WERE NOT. MAKE SURE THEY DON'T- TAKE THAT SPOT IN THE UC CAMPUS SO THE BIG PICTURE HERE OF COURSE WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE APPLYING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS THIS YEAR EVERYBODY DESERVES A FAIR SHOT THAT'S THE BASIS OF OUR UC ADMISSIONS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA MERITOCRACY AND WHETHER IT'S ONE PERSON MADE BY FRAUD OR HUNDRED IT'S WRONG. AND DENIES ADMISSIONS TO HONEST AND QUALIFIED STUDENTS I WITH ME TODAY ARE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT HOPES TO GO TO A UC AS WELL THE STATE AUDITOR TO TALK ABOUT- THEIR THEIR THEIR FINDINGS AND AGAIN I WILL NOTE. THAT THE UC IS- AT THAT IS FOCUSING ON THE MAJORITY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THE ONE ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE HAD EXT SOME. WITH AS FAR AS HAVING- ANNUAL AUDITS FROM ALL THE CAMPUSES WE HAVE. HEARD THAT ISSUE WE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS ON THE TWENTY SECOND. WHICH LIMITS THE AUDITS AS OPPOSED TO- AT EACH CAMPUS EVERY THREE YEARS WE WILL HAVE- TO CAMPUS IS EVERY YEAR SO- LIMIT THE NUMBER. OF AT CAMPUSES WILL BE ON A ROTATING ESSENTIALLY FIVE YEAR BASIS WHICH EVERY CAMPUS RECEIVES AN AUDIT. SO WITH THAT I ASK THE ARRIVAL THANK YOU. THEY GIVE US MCCARTY THE FIRST LEAD WITNESS. IS FROM THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM A BOB HARRIS PRINCIPAL AUDITOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE THAT WE ARE ON A LIMITED TIME THE SCHEDULE HERE SO IF- THE WITNESSES MIGHT.

ALL MISTER MENTIONED THE ATHLETICS THE PROCESS IS SUBJECT TO ABUSE- WE SAW THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT VALIDATION OF TALENTS. IN INSUFFICIENT TRACKING THE PARTICIPATION THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT AREA AS WELL.

TO CARRY OVER IS DEFINED AS THE FUNDS REMAINING AFTER THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE PROPOSES USING THE MORE COMMON CONCEPT OF CARRY OVER THAT FUNDS ALLOCATED ANY GIVEN YEAR ARE FOR USE IN THAT YEAR. THIS DISTINCTION IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WHEN WE CONSIDER MAKING A DIFFERENCE TO CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF ADULT EDUCATION SERVICES TODAY.

HOWEVER USING THE YEAR OVER YEAR MODEL PROPOSED IN AB FOURTEEN NINETY ONE CARRYOVER IS ESTIMATED TO BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OR 24% OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL ALLOCATION AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY AGENCIES. CARRYING OVER MORE THAN A 100% OF THEIR ANNUAL ALLOCATION QUITE SIMPLY THIS MEANS THAT FUNDING IS NOT SERVING STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS IN THE FISCAL YEAR.

I'M HERE 2% ON AN ISSUE THAT I KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN IS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART. THE ISSUE OF ETHNIC STUDIES. THIS BILL. WILL REQUIRE CALIFORNIA'S COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS SEEKING AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. TO TAKE TO BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A THREE UNIT I THINK STUDIES COURSE. I'D LIKE TO SHARE A PERSONAL STORY OF HOW I'VE BECOME SUCH A TRUE BELIEVER. OF THE POWER AND THE POTENTIAL. OF ETHNIC STUDIES TO CHANGE LIVES. I AM A PRODUCT OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES MOVEMENT. I RECEIVED WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A PRETTY BASIC AMERICAN EDUCATION AS THE SON. OF A CAREER US ARMY CIVIL SERVANT I WAS I GREW UP ON MILITARY BASES AROUND THE WORLD. AND I TENDED WATER BASICALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON MILITARY BASES- SERVING THE CHILDREN OF AREN'T THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE US ARMED FORCES. MY EDUCATION WAS PRETTY WHAT I CONSIDER PRETTY TYPICAL IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES. YOU KNOW I'VE LEARNED ABOUT HOW. OUR NATION WAS STARTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE PILGRIMS AT PLYMOUTH ROCK. AND I LEARNED HOW OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED. BY THE GREAT FOUNDERS OF OUR NATION. GEORGE WASHINGTON THE FATHER OF OUR COUNTRY. THE FARM OF THE FOUNDERS THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION. MEN LIKE THOMAS JEFFERSON AND JAMES MADISON. I DID WELL ENOUGH WITH THIS. CONVENTIONAL AMERICAN EDUCATION TO GET INTO UC BERKELEY FOR COLLEGE. WHICH YOU KNOW IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES IT WAS A LOT EASIER TO GET INTO UC BERKELEY AT THAT TIME. BUT IN MY THIRD YEAR IN COLLEGE I DECIDED. TO TAKE AN ELECTIVE. ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES TWENTY EIGHT INTRODUCTION TO ASIAN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND THAT COURSE CHANGE MY LIFE. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I LEARNED THE HISTORY OF PEOPLE THAT I KNEW. ALL THAT I CAN RELATE TO. AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS THAT I LEARNED FROM ETHNIC STUDIES. WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSPECTIVE. THAT HISTORY LITERATURE SO MANY ACADEMIC. DISCIPLINES DEPEND SO MUCH ON WHO IS TELLING THE STORY WHO IS TELLING THE HISTORY. WHOSE PERSPECTIVE IS BEING REPRESENTED. AT THE THIRTIES ALSO TAUGHT ME THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING. THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE. WHAT WE'RE HEARING AND LEARNING AND READING. IT'S SO DEPENDENT AGAIN ON WHO'S TELLING IT AND WHOSE PERSPECTIVE IT'S COMING FROM. AND SO I THINK NOW. IN THIS TIME. WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING NOT ONLY IN MULTICULTURAL CALIFORNIA. BUT IN OUR NATION AS WE STRUGGLE WITH SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES. OF. DEALING CELEBRATING THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CALIFORNIA CAN YOU CALL STUDENTS. I HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES IN ORDER TO RECEIVE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE COUNT NAY LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND- I WOULD LIKE TO.

I TAKING ONE ENOUGH THIRTY THIRD EDUCATION OUTCOMES IMPROVE THEIR- RATES ARE THAN STUDENTS WHO DO NOT TAKE. THAT THINKS THAT.

THIS BILL BOTH COMPLIMENTS AND IS RESPONSIVE AND CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX DR SHIRLEY WEBER'S BILL THAT WAS PASSED INTO LAW. LAST YEAR SO BY HAVING ONE COURSE THAT STUDENTS COULD TAKE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. FOR CSU TRANSFER BOTH SAVES TIME MONEY AND FACILITATES THE TRANSFER PROCESS AND TRYING TO THE DEGREE THIRD. THIS BILL WILL HELP TO BOLSTER THE ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE ABOUT 25% OF OUR COLLEGES. DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THE STUDIES CURRICULUM AND IN DOING SO THIS BILL WILL HELP DIVERSIFY HIRE MORE ETHNIC STUDIES FACULTY. WERE LIKELY THE FACULTY OF COLOR INTO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE RANKS SOMETHING THAT WE- SIMPLY ARE ALSO VERY VERY INTERESTED IN MOVING THE NEEDLE ON. FOURTH GIVEN THE RACIAL STRIFE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING THROUGHOUT THE THIS COUNTRY. THE DEMAND FOR RACIAL EQUITY AND JUSTICE I THINK STUDIES PROVIDES A CRITICAL VIEW AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SOCIETY'S. HISTORY OF RACE ETHNICITY AND CLASS AND IT PREPARES OUR STUDENTS. FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CITIZENSHIP IN A MULTICULTURAL MULTILINGUAL WORLD ARE THAT THEY WILL INHERIT FIFTH AND FINALLY THE ADOPTION OF THE SENATE BILL. TEN FORTY YEARS LANDMARK IT WILL BE A LANDMARK LEGISLATION THAT WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN. A TO LEAD THE NATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY BY MAKING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

IF YOU THINKING TO YOURSELF I DIDN'T HAVE A CLASS ON THAT I STILL HAVE TO BE I TURNED OUT FINE. THE TRUTH IS THAT MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE VALUE IN ETHNIC STUDIES DO NOT OCCUR THE BRUTALITY CAUSED BY THE LACK OF IT. I THOUGHT TECHNICALITY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT HOME AN INDIAN HEADDRESS. MY CLASSMATE ON THANKSGIVING. COOL I CALLED MY GRANDMOTHER TO BE BROUGHT TO TEARS.

CALIFORNIANS REALLY UNDERSTAND CALIFORNIA AND OUR COUNTRY AND WE'RE WE DELIVER THAT EDUCATIONAL CONTENT AND WE'RE IT IS MOST APPROPRIATE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT AGAIN PATCHWORK PIECEMEAL HERE WE'RE GONNA TRY IT HERE AND THERE AND PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT THEY CAN BE WORKED OUT TO TAKE TO REALLY- GET TO THAT THAT THAT THE ETHIC OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FROM ETHNIC STUDIES. AND I'M NOT SURE OF THIS QUITE DOES IT FOR ME IN THIS INSTANCE ODD BECAUSE I THINK THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE I THINK YOU MADE THIS POINT IN YOUR OPENING PRESENTATION- AND IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT- THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE THIS COURSE A COURSE THAT FEELS THE THIS GOAL AND- AND I AGREE WITH YOU A 100% AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I ATTENDED PIERCE COLLEGE ONE SUMMER- YOU KNOW- IN AND TOOK A COURSE IN ITS FINAL WATER RESPECTFULLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY- PROVIDE THIS COURSEWORK FOR STUDENTS THAT WANT TO TAKE IT. BUT I CAN SEE. AS WELL YOU KNOW I WENT TO CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE- THE FIRST. CHICANO STUDIES PROGRAM IN THE NATION- WORLD RENOWNED IN ITS ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAMMING. BUT I COULD SEE WANTING TO GET TO NORTHRIDGE TO REALLY TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTELLECTUALLY. ON MY ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE COURSE WORK AND THIS COULD BE FOR ANY ANY INSTITUTION. AND SO I COULD SEE A REASON NOT TO KNOCK OUT SOMETHING IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IF I DON'T WANT TO. BECAUSE I DECIDED TO DO IT LATER IN IN THE CSU- OR TO TAKE IT IF IT IS MY CHOICE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT AGAIN NOT THAT WOULD BE MORE ON A CHOICE ISSUE AND THEN I'VE GOT. BROADER. INSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT- THE PURGATORY THAT IS COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR SO MANY STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS THAT WANT TO GET IN THERE TO ACCOMPLISH A GOAL TO FURTHER THEIR LIVES TO GET A JOB TO GET ON TO HIGHER ED. IN INCOMPLETE A- A POST SECONDARY DEGREE- AND% THAT WE ARE MAKING IT EVEN MORE STIFLING MORE DIFFICULT MORE OF A STRUGGLE MORE OF A DELAY MORE OF A WAIT- A MORE OF A- FIVE A BLOCK TO GETTING THEM WHERE WHERE THEY WANT TO GO AND SO- I YOU KNOW I'M GONNA VOTE NO ON THIS TODAY I'VE GOT ALL OF THESE CONCERNS. I YOU KNOW I I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL SO I WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND- BECAUSE AGAIN I APPRECIATED THE POINT YOU MADE IN YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND I AGREE WITH THAT AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS WORKED. DILIGENTLY AND OVER TIME WHETHER IT'S K. TWELVE FOR HIRE READ TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN ETHNIC STUDIES- COMPONENT IN A STUDENT'S EDUCATION. AT LEAST. TWICE IN THEIR LIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MULVANEY MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I DON'T WANT A REPEAT- MANY OF THE- POINTS THAT WERE JUST MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MORAN- BUT I SHARE- BOTH HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CURRICULUM AND IT WAS A CO AUTHOR OF OUR CHAIRS BILL- OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS- SO I BELIEVE IN THAT- BUT I ON ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT HOW IT FITS INTO THE OVERALL- CURRICULUM- IN A TWO YEAR PROGRAM- WHERE IT'S REALLY FAST PACED AND- STUDENTS ARE FREQUENTLY VERY GOAL ORIENTED- AND HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT COURSES. AND OF MAY CHOOSE TO PRIORITIZE- OTHER THINGS AND SO WHEN WE REQUIRE OF COURSE IT I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A BUTTERFLY EFFECT THAT TO- AT THE COULD OCCUR HERE BUT- I- WILL SUPPORT THE BILL- TODAY AND- AND HOPE THAT- WE CAN CONTINUE TALKING- I KNOW WE'LL CONTINUE TALKING. ABOUT THIS TOPIC BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. MISTER MURATSUCHI WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE TO YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS IN THE FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES- IN THIS COMMITTEE- I DO WANT TO- THE SPECIFICALLY KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE- CONCERNS RAISED BY A MR LEVINE- YOU KNOW I. RECOGNIZE MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE I HAD- I RAISE MANY OF THOSE SAME QUESTIONS WHEN IT WHEN I WAS. APPROACHED BY THE- COMMITTEE COLLEGE L. I. COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT- ON WHETHER TO TAKE THAT THE BILL ON I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES FOR COMMITTEE COLLEGE IS- IS TO GET OUR- OUR- OUR OUR STUDENTS TO- TO GET THEIR DEGREES IN EITHER TRANSFERRED OR TO. TO GET THEIR ASSOCIATE DEGREE OR TO GET THEIR THEIR CERTIFICATES OR TRAINING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING. A FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- YOU KNOW IT'S A BALANCING ACT IN TERMS OF- WHETHER WE- SHOULD BE ADDING EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT A NEW REQUIREMENT OR NOT. ORIGINALLY I HAD THE BILL. TO REQUIRED JUST FOR ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER. IN ORDER TO ALLOW- YOU KNOW THE ONE THIRD OF CSU STUDENTS. THAT THAT TRANSFER FROM COMMUNICABLE AS HIS. TWO TWO S. AND THE- LOS ANGELES CHANCER INDICATED TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY. BY BEING ABLE TO SATISFY THE ETHICS AS REQUIREMENT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEFORE THEY TRANSFER. TO- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY. BUT YOU KNOW AND- ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS AN ISSUE OF- OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM. IT WAS ACTUALLY THERE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACADEMIC SENATE THAT- INDICATED THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE THE REQUIREMENT BROADER OF FROM NOT JUST STATE REQUIREMENT FOR ASSOCIATE. DEGREES FOR TRANSFER BUT FOR ALL STUDENTS- SEEKING AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE. AND SO THAT- YOU KNOW IS THE REASON WHY WE BROUGHT IN IT FOR THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE SO I WANT TO. MAKE SURE ALL THE NEW THAT- THIS MADE THIS BILL MAY ULTIMATELY. NOT BE NECESSARY ULTIMATELY THEY THE COMMUNIQU IS ACT SENATE MADE TO ADOPT THEIR OWN AT AS QUORUM. BUT- IN A ORDER TO. CONTINUE PUSH FOR MORE. YOU KNOW EDUCATE UP TO EDUCATE TO- IN PREPARE OUR STUDENTS- AT ALL LEVELS HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNICABLE IS- UNIVERSITY. TO DEAL WITH THE- THE CHALLENGES OF AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF DIVERSITY IN IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT IS WHY I AM OKAY OF PUSHING FORWARD WITH THIS BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI WHEN I THANK YOU ALSO FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE FIVE. OF THE ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR VERY ELOQUENT PRESENTATION. OF THE POWER. OF ETHNIC STUDIES THE POWER OF CHANGING LIVES AND BEFORE WE VOTE I JUST WANT TO SHARE. A STORY THAT I READ AND PERHAPS A PROFESSOR THAT YOU MAY HAVE HAD AT CAL. RON TO KHAKI SOMEONE WHO HAD A BIG INFLUENCE OF ME. RUN TO COCKY. A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY FIRST. FEATURE OF BLACK- STUDIES BLACK HISTORY AT UCLA BEFORE GOING TO CAO TELLS A STORY OF HOW HE GOT OUT OF THE TAXI- IN WASHINGTON DC GOT INTO A TAXI WAS GOING TO GIVE A PRESENTATION. AND THE TAXI DRIVER YOU KNOW JUST MAKING CONVERSATION ASK RON TAKAKI WHERE HE WAS FROM. YOU KNOW AND I THINK- HE USES THAT HE EXPLAINS THAT THAT COMMENT FROM THE TAXI DRIVER. RUN TO CATCH HIS FAMILY HAD BEEN IN HAWAII FOR GENERATIONS AND SO THAT QUESTION LIES TO THE ROOT OF WHO IT IS THAT'S AN AMERICAN AND HOW ARE WE PERCEIVED. AS AMERICANS AND SO I THANK- MISTER MURATSUCHI FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ASKED IF I CAN BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU SIR- DO WE HAVE A MOTION.
