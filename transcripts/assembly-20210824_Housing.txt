REALLY LEADING THE EFFORTS TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR- LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND COMMUNITYCOLLEGE WORKFORCE I THINK WE KNOW THAT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS THERE'S JUST A HUGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO. ARE EITHER HOMELESS OR BEEN AFFECTED THE HOMELESS IN RECENT YEARS AND I THINK ANY ACTION WE CAN TAKE. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IS IMPORTANT AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THIS CREATIVE IDEA TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IN LA AND ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A GOOD STRONG CONSENSUS ITEM- WITHOUT ANY FIND. ANY OTHER COMMENTS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORPS OF YES I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR- THIS IS NOT ONLY A CREATIVE SOLUTION IT'S PRAGMATIC AND IT BRINGS. US SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER- THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD ON HOUSING PROJECTS. I TO HOST A- IN MY OWN DISTRICT FULLERTON COLLEGE IN CYPRESS COLLEGE VERY. WELL ATTENDED COLLEGES BUT WE KNOW IN THIS LAST YEAR. BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT SOME OF OUR ENROLLMENT DROPPED AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. TO GET OUR STUDENTS BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GET THEM HOUSED IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO POSSIBLY. STEALING YOUR IDEA AND SEEING IF WE CAN DO A MODEL IN ORANGE COUNTY- AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANKS SO MUCH. IS THAT A MOTION MOVED FOR. MOTION WITH OUR ANSWER SECOND THERE'S A SECOND ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL AND- I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE FINANCING STRUCTURE FOR DOING. IT FOR CARRYING THIS OUT. BECAUSE PART OF THE AS YOU POINTED OUT PART OF THE HOUSING ISSUE IS THE LAND COSTS AND THAT'S A LARGE PART OF WHY COST FIVE HUNDRED. THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT TO BUILD THINGS SO WHAT GETS USED AFTER THAT IS A PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT MONEY THEY GET USED TO BUILD IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA CLEAR THE LAND AND BUILD NEW UNITS THAT'S ONE THING IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONVERT ANOTHER THING THAT'S ANOTHER COST ARE WE STILL USING PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY FOR THAT OR ARE WE USING MONEY THAT IS DESIGNATED IN OUR IN OUR GENERAL FUND FOR- FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK A LOT OF TAXPAYERS ARE REALLY CONCERNED THAT PROP IN THE PROPER NINETY EIGHT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY OUT OF AND THEN PUT IT IN EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR EDUCATION NOT THE HOUSING PART SO IF EDUCATION HAS LAND AND THEY WANT TO PARTNER UP THE MONEY FOR THAT SHOULD COME FROM OUR GENERAL FUND. THAT IT AND NOT PROP NINETY EIGHT FIVE. YEAH SO THAT'S MY QUESTION IS WE ARE USING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS TO ACTUALLY BUILD- I DON'T NOT THINK SO I'M- ALMOST POSITIVE- BUT LET ME ASK- MISTER ALAN THESE TO. BE MORE SPECIFIC WITH THAT QUESTION OKAY THANKS ALLEN EAST IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT PLEASE THE SOURCES OF FUNDING GOOD MORNING- YEAH GOOD MORNING IT'S AN IMMENSELY ART OUT OF IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S A LITTLE THAT THE JOINT OCCUPANCY IS WORKING WITH THE OPPORTUNITY COLLEGE AND THE PRIVATE ENTITY THAT'S GOING TO SUCH A B. WE HAVE AN AYE BUILDING. OUR BUILDING ON ON LAND THAT'S ON THAT'S NOT BEING USED AT THIS MOMENT IT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY'S GOING TO BE USED- BUT I DON'T STATE SPECIFICALLY ONE OR THE OTHER- IF YOU LOCKED UP TODAY I COULD CHECK RESEARCH THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU BY TODAY. ACCORDING THIS REPORT OUT- AND- BUT AT THAT POINT I DON'T THINK SO BUT I DON'T WANT TO- TAPER CERTAIN WHETHER THAT'S THECASE BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S NOT BEING APARTMENT IT MIGHT NOT BE USED. FOR THIS PARTICULAR. PROJECT I THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT WOULD HAVE TO CLEAR IF FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. SO I LIKE THE IDEA I LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE- WHERE KIDS EIGHT GUARDS ARE MORE CENTRALLY LOCATED NEXT TO AN EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY LIKE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. A LOT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE YOU KNOW I WENT TO ONE- AND IT'S BECAUSE I LIVED IN THE AREA WHERE. IT WAS AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO IS THEY THEY DRAW FROM THE COMMUNITY SO A LOT OF KIDS DO HAVE HOUSING. BUT THE ONES THAT DON'T ARE THE ONES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND HAVING HOUSING THAT IS CENTRAL TO THE COLLEGE SO THEY CAN HAVE PURSUE SOME EDUCATION GOALS. IS LAUDABLE WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE USING EDUCATION MONEY FOR EDUCATION AND- AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S NOT REALLY SPELLED OUT. IN THIS AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT TO BE SPELLED OUT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'LL JUST ADD THAT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- THAT THE MAIN WITNESS WAS CORRECT THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE DRAWN ON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS IT WOULD. INVOLVE TRADITIONAL FORMAL HOUSING FINANCING TYPICALLY WITH THE PARTNERS THAT WOULD BE WORKING WITH L. A. C. C. D. ON THIS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT DOLLARS THAT. HAVE STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT- BUT I'M SURE THE AUTHOR CAN CLARIFY THAT AND- GET A GOOD ANSWER BACK TO THE MOISTURE CAN ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO THE CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YOUR SUPPORT ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY.
