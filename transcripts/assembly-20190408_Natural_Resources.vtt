CLEANER IN THE WASTE STREAM.

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:03.701
CLEAN STREAMS INCREASE THE

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.770
MARKETABILITY OF A RECYCLABLE SO

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.037
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY TURNED

QUESTIONS MISTER CHILD JUST A

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:02.399
QUICK QUESTION FOR THE WITNESSES --

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:03.467
THEY DID THE ONE ON EACH ITEM

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.235
AND SAY THAT IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:07.938
COST LESS TO DO.

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.907
A DOOR STREAM SYSTEMS.

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:11.542
THIS IS A LESS COSTLY -- MORE

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:13.444
MORE CAR ARE EXPERIENCED AT

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:14.978
INCREMENTAL COST -- TO COLLECT

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:16.113
MATERIAL SEPARATELY AS A DIVIDED

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:20.184
CART -- ANNA SPLIT TRUCK.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.318
SO THAT WHEN YOU COLLECT

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.619
MATERIALS KEPT SEPARATE ALL

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.121
THROUGH THE COLLECTION PROCESS

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:25.823
YOUR MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.558
TECHNOLOGY CAN HANDLE SINGLE

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:28.692
STREAM OR DUAL STREAM.

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.160
SO TO INCREMENTAL COSTS A SMALL

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:33.130
PERCENTAGE THE RETURN IS REDUCED --

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:34.998
RESIDUAL THAT COST YOU ENDS UP

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.701
IN THE LANDFILL AND IT'S IT'S

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:40.938
WORTH THE INVESTMENT STOP FOR

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:44.208
THE LONG TERM IN MY OPINION.

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:45.909
SEVEN ASSESSMENT YEAH I WOULD

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:47.311
JUST LIKE TO STATE -- THIS

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:47.978
NATIONAL SORT OF SOMETHING THAT

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:48.745
WE ALL ARE STE TRYING TO

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.214
STRUGGLE WITH AND AND TRYING TO

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.615
FIND A WAY TO TO THREAD THE

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.650
NEEDLE SO I APPRECIATE THEM.

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:55.586
I APPRECIATE THE CARROT APPROACH

BUT TO IT.

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.692
BUT THAT IT DOES COST MORE UNTIL

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:03.160
WE HEAR FROM WITNESSES A WE

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.261
RESPECT THEIR THAT THEY'RE ALL

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.229
FROM BAY AREA.

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.263
TYPE CITIES AND SO WHEN YOU

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.397
MOVED FURTHER OUT INTO THE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:08.966
VALLEY IN DOWN THE STATE THINGS

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.067
A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT AS

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.535
YOU WELL KNOW REPRESENTING RURAL

PAY ATTENTION THE COST ISSUES

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:23.680
BUT ALSO THAT WE USE THE CARROT

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:24.248
NOT A STICK. TO ADDRESS THIS

THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:35.919
OLD AND POTENTIALLY LEAKING OIL

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.822
AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.190
SOME OF THESE SITES ARE IDLE

IDLE DESERTED AND HAZARDOUS OIL

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:53.937
AND GAS WELLS CAN LEAK POLLUTION.

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:55.772
FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:57.107
SIXTEEN APPEAR OF IDLE OIL AND

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.242
GAS WELLS WERE FOUND LEAKING

WELLS INCLUDE METHANE ADVANCING.

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.397
METHANE IS A CLIMATE CHANGE GAS

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:21.965
MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN

CARBON DIOXIDE.

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.902

WELLS CAN AND DO LEAK.

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:08.111
AND WHEN THEY DO IT CAN RESULT

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.813
IN EMISSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.549
CLIMATE CHANGE.

SUBJECT MATTER I WANT TO SAY

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.122
THAT THE I'VE ACTUALLY HAD AN

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:08.257
INTEREST IN INNOVATION ADVOCACY

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:10.593
FOR LEAST FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.128
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.096
FOUNDER OF THE CITY OF RANCHO

01:02:13.162 --> 01:02:15.331
CORDOVA WHICH IS OF COURSE A

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.899
TYPE OF INNOVATION.

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.268
AND I PUT TOGETHER MY THOUGHTS

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:22.038
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATION.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.873
IN A SPEECH I DID BACK THEN

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.342
WHICH I'VE OFTEN UPDATED.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.211
BUT SO KEY IDEAS IN THE REALM OF

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.513
INNOVATION.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.881
A GREAT COMMENT BY HARVEY

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.850
FIRESTONE WHO ONCE SAID.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.686
THOUGHT NOT MONEY IS THE REAL

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.521
BUSINESS CAPITAL.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.589
THE ABILITY TO BRING FORWARD A

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:42.058
NEW IDEA IS OFTEN THE MOST VITAL

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:43.926
ELEMENT IN ANY.

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.329
HUMAN ENTERPRISE [inaudible]

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:49.165
MARK TWAIN.

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.433
ALSO WAS A FAVORITE ON

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.834
INNOVATION HE SAYS THE MAN WITH

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:54.537
A NEW IDEA IS A CRANK.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.939
UNTIL IT SUCCEEDS.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.841
IDEAS TEST THE BOUNDARIES OF

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.376
WHAT WE EXPECT.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.078
AND A LOT OF OUR FUTURE DEPENDS

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.714
UPON IT.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.482
AND THEN THE LAST COMMENT ON

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.284
INNOVATION JUST AS A PRELUDE TO

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.452
THIS IS THAT.

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:12.755
ALL GREAT HUMAN ENDEAVOR HAS TO

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.757
EVOLVE THROUGH THREE WORDS

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:15.057
[inaudible]

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.659
IMPOSSIBLE [inaudible]

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:17.994
IMPROBABLE [inaudible]

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.796
INEVITABLE.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:23.099
AND I FEEL I I AGREE WITH OUR

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.501
GOVERNOR FORMER GOVERNOR WHO.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.204
NOTICED THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:29.939
NEXT SUBSTANTIAL.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.874
ONE AND SO WE ARE IN NEED OF

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.210
OUTSTANDING IDEAS TO PUSH BACK

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.812
THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS KNOWN.

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:37.446
WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS POSSIBLE?

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:41.751
ON AB TWO DONE A SEARCH FOR THE

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.119
CLIMB RIVERS GRANT PROGRAM.

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.587
WILL SEEK TO ACCELERATE AND

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.422
SUPPORT THE RESEARCH INVOLVING

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:47.757
NEW INNOVATIONS.

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:48.791
THAT IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.793
RESILIENT TO THE IMPACTS OF

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.794
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.429
I WANT TO SEE THE COMMITTEE HAS

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.598
OFFERED TO SUGGEST A MUCH WHICH

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:56.832
I AM PLEASED TO ACCEPT.

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.267
I ACTUALLY FEEL THE CHANGE

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.403
PROTECT HER FROM PROMOTE TO

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.104
CONTRIBUTE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.240
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE ROLE OF

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:05.408
SCIENCE IS NOT TO GIVE YOU A

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:08.177
WHOLLY NEW IDEA.

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.345
BUT ACTUALLY TO CONTRIBUTE TO

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.080
THE IMPLEMENTATION IDEA BY

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:12.215
MAKING IT'S A CHEAPER MORE

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:13.849
FEASIBLE.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:18.487
WHAT I REFER TO IS AS OF?

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.156
REDUCING THE RISK.

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.124
OF CHANGE.

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.060
AND SO WE ACTUALLY NEED IDEAS

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.195
NOT JUST THE BIG IDEAS.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.129
BUT THE ONES THAT MAKE CHANGE

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.698
TOOK LESS RISKY MORE MANAGEABLE

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.333
MORE FEES WHEN I ACTUALLY THINK

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.534
THAT THAT CHANGE.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.735
KIND OF MOVES MADE THAT

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.604
DIRECTION SO I'M APPRECIATIVE OF

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.239
THAT [inaudible]

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:37.306
ARM.

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.975

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:45.815
THAT WE ARE SEEN CHANGES RELATED

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.283
TO CLIMATE ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.118
THEY ARE LIFE THREATENING.

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.653
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.688

A MEANS OF SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.701
IMPACTS AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.470
A WIDE ARRAY OF POLICIES CAN

IS A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ITSELF

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.718
ONE OF INNOVATION.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.020
FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN

CHANGING THE CONVERSATION.

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:33.996
AND GLOBALLY CALIFORNIA'S LEAD

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.564
IN THAT CONVERSATION AND THIS

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.233
WILL BE A PART OF THAT.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.467
PROCESS.

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:39.302
ARM.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.670
THE BILL PROPOSED THE USE OF A

COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TOWARD

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:44.473
MATCHING GRANT FUNDS. FOR

INNOVATIONS IMPROVE ADAPTABILITY

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:49.278
AND RESILIENT TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.180
IT DOES OFFER A DIFFERENT

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.683
ECONOMIC TOOL THEN JUST BARELY

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.318

BE A VITAL CORNERSTONE OF THAT.

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:31.246
BUT STILL OTHERS WILL HAVE TO

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:32.781

FOR REBUILDING BUT HERE'S THE

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.256
PROBLEM.

AFFORDABILITY INDEX.

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.971
THE RENTAL MARKET VACANCY RATE

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:59.708
ALSO FELL TO NEARLY 0%.

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:01.443
AFTER THE FIRE THERE IS

HOUSING IN THIS AREA.

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:08.183
THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE A STRONG

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:09.551
SENSE OF PLACE AND THIS IS

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.452
SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.886

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.661
DIFFICULT FOR CAMPFIRE VICTIMS

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:21.196

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.958
member James Gallagher and

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:19.426
look forward to working with

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:21.195
the member once the preemption

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:22.696
to conditional land use

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:24.665
authority is redacted the

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.834
Chico city council did not have

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:28.435
an opportunity ahead of this

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:30.771
hearing to discuss and or issue

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:33.240
and oppose unless amended letter

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.975
additionally the Butte County

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.677
Board of supervisors letter of

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.946
support did not seek approved

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.447
the approval of either of the

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:42.249
two suit supervisors in the

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.785
Chico area overwhelmingly the

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.954
most populated city pre and

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:49.456
post campfire our community

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:51.025
is concerned about lifting

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:53.060
conditional land use authority

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.428
ma'am your your two minutes are

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:55.896
up -- if I would like one of

01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:57.731
your colleagues to finish okay

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.968
and and we also have the letter

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:02.269
so unless you want to read into

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:03.270
the record we've lost we all

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:05.606
have the letter read read

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.174
this part that starting here

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.643
the city of Chico currently

01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:11.245
has twenty five hundred single

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:13.180
for family units and twenty

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:14.548
eight hundred multi family

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.216
units of housing in various

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:18.152
stages of development that

01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:20.654
are overwhelmingly not pending

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.956
city regulatory authority

01:39:23.257 --> 01:39:24.892
I see AB for thirty as a

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:26.794
considerable over reach a

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.862
potential state preemption under

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.664
any circumstances let alone

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:33.167
potentially that opposition to

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:35.402
the most impacted jurisdictions

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.504
I am urging a no vote to pass

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.106
this bill to appropriations

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:40.741
unless amended should you have

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.343
any questions about my personal

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:44.078
opposition of this bill please

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:46.313
do not hesitate to contact me

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:50.451
next okay I have something

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.720
to -- I mean the main

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.922
the thing is that I mean

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:57.424
I have total sympathy and

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.827
empathy for the survivors

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.028
of the campfire in the fire

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.629
came within ten feet of my

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:04.798
own house and I was evacuated

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:07.901
but I am I see this

01:40:07.968 --> 01:40:09.803
as a really stunning over

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:12.306
reach of power into the locally

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:13.941
elected representatives of Butte

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:15.576
county local governments as

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.878
the mayor said -- the locally

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.279
elected officials should always

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:20.814
have the decision making power

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.750
over their development and

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:23.884
since they're already fifty

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.652
three hundred approved future

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.188
residences in Chico many of us

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:29.723
see the logical next step is

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.892
building the opportunity sites

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:33.527
already listed in the general

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:36.196
plan which already has expensive

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:38.098
infrastructure in place this

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.333
would offer the possibility

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.968
of efficient public transit

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:42.703
walkability and particular

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:44.705
affordable housing quickly in

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:46.106
addition the sequel approval

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:48.075
process is there to not only

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.610
protect the environment and

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:51.812
the last remaining five percent

01:40:52.045 --> 01:40:53.447
of our endangered species but

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:54.748
also to protect the health and

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:57.251
safety of the people large or

01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:58.685
small developments which are not

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.521
able to pass carbon emissions

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:02.890
worsen air quality and climate

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.725
change and should not be allowed

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:06.560
the irony would be to approve a

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.896
bill like AB for thirty and

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:11.432
streamline this process on the

01:41:11.498 --> 01:41:12.833
kinds of developments which

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:14.802
actually would contribute to

01:41:14.868 --> 01:41:17.104
such disasters events disastrous

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.373
events as the campfire emerging

01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.541
a no vote okay can you just

01:41:20.607 --> 01:41:21.775
identify yourself there was

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.477
a Beth Devereaux from Chico

01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:25.212
thank you last witness please

01:41:26.046 --> 01:41:27.614
good afternoon madam chair and

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.516
members of the committee my name

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.452
is Molly Colton I'm an organizer

01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:32.953
an advocate for Sierra Club

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.988
California I was also born and

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:37.057
raised and paradise my family

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.425
and friends lost everything in

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:40.727
the camp fire being from Butte

01:41:40.794 --> 01:41:42.362
county I know first hand the

01:41:42.429 --> 01:41:44.565
impact this bill could have on

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:46.166
the region and the necessity of

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:48.001
housing for wild fire victims

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:49.670
including my friends and family

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:52.039
I also understand the need for

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:54.341
environmental protection given

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:55.809
that our official position

01:41:55.876 --> 01:41:57.544
on the bill is opposed unless

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.346
amended as we believe sequel

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:00.914
provides the opportunity

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.349
for prudent environmental

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.785
consideration we have provided

01:42:04.852 --> 01:42:06.653
the author with for specific

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.455
amendments that we believe would

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:09.957
provide greater environmental

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:12.125
protection to the bill we've

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:13.327
met with the author and are

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:14.928
pleased that he has committed

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:16.663
to adopting these amendments

01:42:17.397 --> 01:42:18.565
I am confident that we can

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:20.200
work with the author to reach

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:22.035
a neutral position and craft

01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:23.704
a bill that would best strike

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.339
a balance between providing

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:27.407
affordable infill housing for

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.576
wild fire victims that best

01:42:29.643 --> 01:42:31.078
coincides with environmental

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:33.046
preservation we look forward

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:34.648
to removing our opposition

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.116
upon seeing upon seeing the

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:37.684
amendments and print thank you

for for comments or questions

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:56.770
assemblymember Melinda's

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:00.107
thank you madam chair I'm I'm

01:43:00.173 --> 01:43:02.242
sorry the witnesses already

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:04.077
left the table of your rate

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.812
here so of the three you

01:43:05.879 --> 01:43:06.580
don't have to come back at

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:07.948
me and you may sit down I'm

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.183
just of the three of you

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:12.419
who how many of you lost

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.655
your your home the three

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:15.989
to testify in opposition

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:20.360
seven nine if you lost your

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:23.096
home in the fire thank you so

01:43:24.331 --> 01:43:26.466
here's my concern is that

01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:27.734
from what I understand Mister

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.603
Gallagher there's some issue

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:31.204
with the conditional use

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.773
land permit is that correct

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:36.777
I think what has been brought

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.178
up is it somehow this would

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:40.480
take away local control -- I

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:42.149
I disagree with that contention

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:43.483
if you read the terms of the

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:46.486
bill -- first of all it requires

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:48.055
-- that these would have to go

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:49.156
through the planning commission

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:50.457
process that have to go to

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:51.858
this to the city council or the

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:53.093
board of supervisors whatever

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.062
the case may be -- it would

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:56.330
have to be consistent with

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:57.798
the general plan and zoning

01:43:58.332 --> 01:43:59.533
so as we all know many of us

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.934
are and local government you

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:03.103
you do a plan the do a general

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.771
plan that you establish where

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:06.173
where residential is going to

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.908
be what zoned residential so

01:44:07.975 --> 01:44:09.309
you've already planned and said

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:11.111
this is okay for a committee

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:12.412
that's worry what the building

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:14.281
taking place would presumably

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:16.450
have to coincide with whatever

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:17.951
the city's general plan AB

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.586
radio right hundred there's no

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:21.421
changing of zoning no change

01:44:21.488 --> 01:44:23.490
in accounting the the change

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:25.258
would be that we're trying to

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:27.461
-- speed up the process by

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:28.996
which people could rebuild their

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:31.331
lives is that a fair way of

01:44:31.398 --> 01:44:33.200
explaining it exactly bill

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.868
bring on more housing that we've

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.136
already planned for as soon as

01:44:36.203 --> 01:44:38.138
possible so that we can house

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:39.940
fire victims okay thank you

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.510
thank you some of the real

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:45.846
amount I think you

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:46.980
as a member Gallagher for

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.649
bringing this forward and

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.350
certainly as someone who is

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:52.552
impacted whose district was

01:44:52.619 --> 01:44:54.321
impacted by the Thomas fire in

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:56.423
the a subsequent debris flows

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:58.025
I understand how important

01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:59.993
it is to rebuild and to get

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:02.696
our community -- functioning

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.965
and moving in as normal

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:07.534
as a way possible in the most

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:09.069
a normal circumstances and

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:11.405
it is very difficult -- one

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:12.939
of the elements that I I've

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.107
been kind of you and I had

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:15.308
a conversation about it that

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.476
we've been trying to figure out

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:18.679
is AB you know the removing of

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:20.547
the sea quest -- piece of it

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:23.450
and I the conversations

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:25.485
in my district still --

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:28.255
happening and -- I have

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:31.091
not felt the positive impact

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:33.393
of public input and through

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.062
the review process as much

01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:37.664
-- for any other issue I've

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:38.699
had to deal with than with

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:41.168
rebuilding our community -- and

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:44.271
so seen that it would be removed

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:46.139
-- because it's you know seek

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.674
was a much thorough is something

01:45:47.741 --> 01:45:48.875
that you know I just throw

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:50.744
out there -- our community

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:52.946
has been very involved in what

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:55.115
rebuilding looks like -- there

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.317
have been really tough not just

01:45:57.384 --> 01:45:59.119
individual owner conversations

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.454
but community conversations

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.823
about area that can no longer be

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:04.357
rebuilt because the topography

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:06.827
itself change and you know

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:08.729
watching a community go through

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.630
a process to have to decide

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.799
that ex number of homes won't

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:13.867
be rebuilt and now we're

01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:14.968
going to service the debris

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:17.871
basin -- was very difficult

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:19.573
-- individuals had to make a

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:21.174
decision but also community

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.442
had to come around and support

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:24.778
some of these decisions a throw

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:26.646
that out there because I know

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:28.715
sometimes we feel that seek when

01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:30.650
the public input process can

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.119
THE DISTRICT HAVE

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:33.520
ALSO SEEN IT UNDER THIS

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:35.388
CIRCUMSTANCE ALSO BE PART OF THE

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:35.655
CEILING.

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:37.691
IN TERMS OF THIS IS HOW WE

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:40.127
REBUILD -- INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:42.329
HAVE HAD TO BE MADE AS WELL AS

01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:44.064
COLLECTIVE DECISIONS FOR THE

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.432
COMMUNITY AND I JUST.

01:46:45.499 --> 01:46:46.967
AS THIS DISCUSSION CONTINUES I

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.168

IN DEATH PROCESS -- IN THIS

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:57.511

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.446
DIFFICULT AND I CERTAINLY

NO I MEAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:41.688
SIMILAR TO SB -- THIRTY FIVE

IS IT THESE ARE VERY LIMITED

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.161
TYPES OF PROJECTS NUMBER ONE

01:47:48.228 --> 01:47:49.296
THEY HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH

01:47:49.362 --> 01:47:51.097
THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING SO

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:52.499
THAT ALREADY HAVE TO BE.

01:47:52.566 --> 01:47:54.134
A PLACE IT'S ZONED RESIDENTIAL

01:47:54.201 --> 01:47:55.335
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN AYE ZONE AND

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:56.336
GONE THROUGH AND NOT EASILY CORE

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.038

AREA OR OTHER BUYER MENTALLY

01:48:08.148 --> 01:48:10.250
SENSITIVE AREA -- SO IT'S IT'S

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.618
THERE'S GONNA BE A LIMITED

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:12.819
AMOUNT OF PROJECTS HERE BUT IT'S

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:14.821
IMPORTANT TOOL AND WHAT IT WOULD

01:48:14.888 --> 01:48:16.423
DO FOR THE SO IN THOSE LIMITED

01:48:16.489 --> 01:48:20.060
CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD BE A

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:21.928
MINISTERIAL PROCESS.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:22.596
THE SO AS LONG AS YOU MET THAT

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:24.164
CRITERIA YOU GET APPROVED BUT

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:24.698
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.299
THROUGH.

01:48:26.366 --> 01:48:27.868

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:30.971
THE BOARD.

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.505
IT WOULD BE PUBLIC INPUT

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:34.074
THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS.

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.642
AND AS LONG AS IT MET THE

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.544
CRITERIA AND MEETS THE OBJECT

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:38.712
YOU COULD ALSO HAVE DESIGN

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:39.880
CRITERIA.

01:48:39.946 --> 01:48:42.449
IN PLACES MANY COMMUNITIES DO.

01:48:42.515 --> 01:48:43.583
AND AS LONG AS A MET THAT

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:45.252
CRITERIA IT WOULD IT WOULD BE

01:48:45.318 --> 01:48:47.587
MINISTERIAL E. APPROVED BY THE

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:48.655

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:49.789
NOW SOME MIGHT TAKE THAT IS

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:51.424
TAKING AWAY THEIR THEIR

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:53.326
CONTROLLER DISCRETION BECAUSE OF

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:55.061
THAT FACT THERE.

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.496
BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LOT.

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:57.664
THAT GOES INTO THAT THIS IS A

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:59.599
VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF PROJECTS

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:02.068
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL.

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:02.669
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.938
LOOKING AT IS WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:05.705
PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF THEIR

AND BUILDING LET'S GET IT DONE.

01:49:16.783 --> 01:49:17.918

01:55:57.917 --> 01:55:59.952

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:21.574
THIS INFILL -- YOU KNOW --

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.343

THERE IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO. ONE

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:28.214
IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT IN SOME

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:30.516
OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE IN.

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:35.021
THIRTY FIVE SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:35.688
ARE NOT IN YOUR PROPOSAL.

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:36.356
I MEAN I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY IT

01:56:36.422 --> 01:56:37.824
LIKE I I MEAN I I I KIND OF JOKE

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:39.125

NO SECRET STREAMLINING FOR SAN

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:43.396
FRANCISCO RIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.864
ALMOST LIKE THAT WAS KIND OF THE

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:46.466
ONLY AREAS IT WOULD REALLY WORK

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:50.670
IN -- SO I'VE I'VE MODELED. FOUR

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:52.171
THIRTY OFF OF THIRTY FIVE THAT I

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.106
WOULD CALL IT.

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:54.340
SICK WITH STREAMLINING FOR BUTTE

01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:55.942
COUNTY HERE AND SO I'VE I'VE

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.276
DEFINITELY IN TRYING TO TAKE

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:58.277
INTO ACCOUNT.

01:56:58.344 --> 01:56:59.579
THAT THERE YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:02.782
DIFFERENT AS I THINK MANY OF YOU

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:05.985
KNOW -- AND MANY AB THE VISITED.

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:07.253
YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:07.987
HAVE [inaudible]

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:10.123
YOU KNOW.

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:11.491
VERY URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WE DO

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:13.359
HAVE URBAN AREAS -- WE DO HAVE A

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:16.562
LOT OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES.

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:18.030
BUT THIS WOULD ENABLE INFILL

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:20.032
PROJECTS IT WOULD ENABLE A MULTI

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:22.101
FAMILY PROJECTS APARTMENTS

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:23.202
THERE'S A LACKS THE A LOT OF

01:57:23.269 --> 01:57:24.570
APARTMENT HOUSING IN CHICO

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:27.073
PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE MORE -- IN

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:28.441
IN OTHER IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:29.342
AS WELL.

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:31.277
BUT ALSO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.079
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:34.447
PART OF HOW PEOPLE LIVE UP IN

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:35.982
THIS IN THIS AREA THAT'S WHAT

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:37.884

HOUSING THAT'S WHY THIS ALLOWS.

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:48.361
FOR THE WHOLE GAMUT -- AND BUT

01:57:48.428 --> 01:57:50.363
ONLY IN THOSE LIMITED AREAS

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:51.864
WHERE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA

01:57:51.931 --> 01:57:52.432

CONCERNS AND THERE'S SOME WORK

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:15.588
TO BE DONE WITH THIS BILL --

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:16.889
FRIEND SINCE SB THIRTY FIVE WAS

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:20.226
REALLY A BILL THAT WAS MEANT --

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:22.595
TO FORCE ARE RETICENT -- CITY

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:23.963
COUNCILS IN URBAN AREAS I'VE TO

01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:25.465
FORCE THEM TO ALLOW PROJECTS

01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:27.533
WHEN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SO IT'S

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.134
STILL UNCLEAR TO ME WITH THIS

01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:29.035
BILL.

01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:30.937
IF A PROJECT COMES IN IT MEETS

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:33.039
THE CRITERIA OF BEINGS UP KIND

01:58:33.105 --> 01:58:34.707
OF THE RIGHT KIND OF PROJECT FOR

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.008
THE ZONING AND OTHERS WHETHER

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:37.643
CITY COUNCIL COULD STILL DENY IT

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:38.878
THAT STILL UNCLEAR TO ME.

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:39.679
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S YOUR

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:41.314
INDICATION TO ALLOW THAT LEVEL

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.815

WITH SB -- THIRTY FIVE DID AND I

01:58:45.885 --> 01:58:46.786
I THINK BECAUSE YOUR BILL MAHER

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.387
MIRRORS THAT BILL SO CLOSELY

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.889

01:59:18.117 --> 01:59:19.352
OTHER MEASURES THAT COMMUNITIES

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:20.920

WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:55.481

IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ME I WANTED

NUMBER ONE LOCAL CONTROL IS

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:46.926
PRESERVED -- THEY AGAIN IF YOU

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:48.461
LOOK AT THE CLEAR TERMS OF THE

02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:49.729
LEGISLATION.

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:50.696
I WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:52.298
WITH THE PLANNING THE CITY

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:54.033
COUNCILS AND COUNTY GOVERNMENTS

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.201
HAVE ALREADY DONE.

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:56.569
AND SAID THIS IS WHERE WE WANT

02:02:56.635 --> 02:02:57.636
TO GROW THIS IS WHERE I WANT TO

02:02:57.703 --> 02:02:58.738
HAVE RESIDENTIAL THERE WOULD

02:02:58.804 --> 02:03:00.106
STILL BE A PUBLIC.

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:02.708
REVIEW PROCESS FOR THESE

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:04.043
PROJECTS.

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:06.078
SO LOCAL CONTROL IS PRESERVED IF

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:07.813
YOU MEAN THAT AND THEN BE ISM.

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.648
WILL BE LESS LIKELY YEAH THAT'S

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:10.549
TRUE.

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:11.784
YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY COMES IN

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:12.952
A PROJECT WHERE EVERYBODY'S

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.420
ALREADY DECIDED THIS MAKES A LOT

02:03:14.487 --> 02:03:16.455
OF SENSE AS WAS HAPPENING IN SAN

02:03:16.522 --> 02:03:18.858
FRANCISCO -- AND THE PROJECTS

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:20.493
WERE GETTING BUILT YEAH OF THIS

02:03:20.559 --> 02:03:21.927
WOULD PROVIDE A MINISTRY --

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:24.230
PROCESS THAT HELPS ENSURE.

02:03:24.296 --> 02:03:26.198
THAT HAPPENS -- BUT IT WOULD

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:28.234
PROVIDE FULL PUBLIC VETTING OF

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.468
THOSE PROJECTS AND IT WOULD HAVE

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:31.203
TO MEET CRITERIA VERY LIMITED

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:32.471
CRITERIA AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:33.672
ABOUT.

02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:34.874
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.244
ON THAT CRITERIA SO THAT PEOPLE

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:39.245
FEEL FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:41.213
SECOND POINT IS LOCALS HAVE BEEN

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.648
INVOLVED THIS WHOLE PROCESS I

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:44.283
STARTED THIS RIDE IN THE

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:45.718
AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE.

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:46.986
WE MET WITH ALL THE LOCAL

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:49.155
GOVERNMENTS WE MET WITH LOCAL

SOMETHING RECYCLED.

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:43.268

OFF SHORT.

02:12:09.988 --> 02:12:11.323
IT'S A CHICKEN OR EGG ARGUMENT

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:12.557
THAT COMES TO MIND WE DISCUSS TO

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:13.592
DEBATE THIS TOPIC.

02:12:13.659 --> 02:12:15.260
IT'S TRUE WE DO HAVE THE MOST

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.061
FOR BUS RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:12:16.128 --> 02:12:17.396
IN THE NATION WITH THE RECYCLING

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:19.131

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:20.165
AFTER YEAR.

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:21.500
BUT WE MUST SET NEW STANDARDS TO

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:23.001
PUSH INDUSTRY TO REALIZE MORE

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:24.336
THE RECYCLE MATERIALS THAT THEY

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:25.370

02:12:25.437 --> 02:12:27.105

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:31.476

CLOSE THE LOOP AT CIRCA CONNERY

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.383
WE MUST DO BETTER.

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:39.351
I UNDERSTAND OUR FRIENDS ON THE

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:41.320
OTHER SIDE WHO OPPOSE A MANDATE

02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:42.120
MANY OF WHOM ARE OUR CUSTOMERS

02:12:42.187 --> 02:12:42.888
BY THE WAY.

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:44.222
NO ONE WANTS GOVERNMENT TELLING

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:45.357
THEM HOW TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS.

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.692
BUT THEY HAVE THE OPTION BE A

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:48.060
VIRGIN WE DO NOT.

02:12:48.126 --> 02:12:49.428
IT'S IF IT'S AT A COST SAVINGS

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:54.466
TO THEM THE MATTEL YES WE USE IT

02:12:54.533 --> 02:12:55.867
BUT ONLY IF IT'S CHEAPER.

02:12:55.934 --> 02:12:56.735
UNFORTUNATELY COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:57.369
WITH RECYCLING FOR STRUCTURE THE

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:58.503
STATE HAS NO BEARING ON DOMESTIC

TAKE ORDERS A LOSS OF HOPE

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:03.508
VIRGIN RESIN GOES UP AT SOME

02:13:03.575 --> 02:13:04.409
POINT OR SHUT DOWN A HUNDRED

NATIONAL SOARED.

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:50.255
EPISODE HAS TOLD US THAT WE'RE

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:52.324
NOT REALLY RECYCLING UNLESS

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:54.359
SOMEBODY IS BUYING THAT MATERIAL

02:13:54.426 --> 02:13:55.727
IF THEY'RE NOT BUYING THE

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:57.429
PLASTIC AND PUTTING IT INTO A

02:13:57.496 --> 02:13:59.364
NEW PRODUCT THAT WE'RE NOT

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:00.232
REALLY RECYCLING.

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:02.401
OUGHT THE RECYCLE CONTENT THE

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:04.136
IDEA OF MANDATING RECYCLE

02:14:04.202 --> 02:14:05.937
CONTENT IS SOMETHING THAT THIS

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:08.206
STATE PIONEERED TWENTY FIVE

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:09.107
YEARS AGO.

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:19.651
TODAY WE HAVE A 35% RECYCLED

CONTENT MANDATE FOR GLASS

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.121
CONTAINERS BUT THE MARKET.

02:14:23.188 --> 02:14:24.923
THAT WE HELP BUILD IS ACHIEVING

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:27.159
MORE THAN 50% RECYCLED CONTENT

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:29.428
AND THE RECOVERY RATE FOR THE PT

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:31.630
BOTTLE IS HIGHER THAN THE

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:33.565
RECOVERY RATE FOR GLASS BOTTLES.

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:35.534

CALIFORNIA AND YET WE'RE USING

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:42.641
50% RECYCLED CONTENT.

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:43.608
WE HAVE MORE THAN A HALF A DOZEN

IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:47.212
AND THE REASON THAT WE HAVE A

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:49.080
HALF A DOZEN PROCESSORS FOR THAT

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:51.082
MATERIAL IS BECAUSE PRIVATE

02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:52.184
INVESTORS IN THE STATE OF

02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:54.753

EVERYTHING THAT'S COLLECTED IN

SYSTEM IS BEING UNDER UTILIZED

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:23.815
BECAUSE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER

02:15:23.882 --> 02:15:25.183

OUTLINED IN EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:21.132

02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:22.534
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR

COLLECTION RATE IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:26.905
HAVE A SEVENTY FIVE OR 80%

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:30.008
COLLECTION RIGHT SO IF YOU GET

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:32.143
275% OR A 100% WHICH ARE

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:34.412
OUTLINED IN AB?

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:35.280
SEVEN NINETY TWO IT DOESN'T

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:36.815
RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT WE'RE

02:17:36.881 --> 02:17:38.717
NOT GETTING A 100% EVENING

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:41.019
COLLECTED BACK -- LET ALONE THE

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:42.854
CONTAMINATION THAT WE TALKED

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:45.223
ABOUT EVEN IN -- AGUILAR CARRIES

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.759
BILL EARLIER TODAY SO WE ARE

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:50.762
ALREADY DOWN FROM 1100% ACTUALLY

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.430
DOWN THE 75% IF THAT'S THE

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:53.698
COLLECTION RATE AT THAT

02:17:53.765 --> 02:17:55.200
PARTICULAR TIME.

02:17:55.266 --> 02:17:57.002
THE SECOND THING THERE'S YIELD

02:17:57.068 --> 02:17:59.237
LOSS OUR P. R. C. C. DID A STUDY

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:02.540
IN THE FALL WITH OUR RECLAIMER

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:04.776
IS AND AND AND LOOKED AT ABOUT.

02:18:04.843 --> 02:18:06.578
THIRTY THREE AT THREE THOUSAND

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:07.178
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT

02:18:07.245 --> 02:18:09.047
POUNDS OF SORTED BAIL SO WHEN

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:10.248
YOU GET THE BALES A COME BACK.

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:12.317
EVEN THE RECLAIMER IS HAD A TEN

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:14.185
AND A HALF PERCENT YIELD LOSS

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:16.721
FROM THE BAIL THAT CAME BACK SO

02:18:16.788 --> 02:18:18.857
NOW YOU'RE ALREADY DOWN FROM

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.392
WHATEVER THE 75%.

02:18:20.458 --> 02:18:22.727
OF OUR COLLECTION RADIUS FROM

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:24.429
WHAT YOU GET BACK FROM WHAT THEY

02:18:24.496 --> 02:18:26.331
GET BACK TO THAT TO THE BAIL SO

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:28.933
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO A

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.369
75% OR A 100% RATE.

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:32.771
TURNING AROUND INTO ANOTHER

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:36.074
BOTTLE -- WE TALK ABOUT THE FDA

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:39.644
STANDARDS THAT IS IMPORTANT AND

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:41.513
OUR OTHER OUR OTHER PRODUCTS

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:43.481
SUCH AS THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT

02:18:43.548 --> 02:18:44.616
WHAT A 100%.

02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:46.484
RECYCLED CONTENT RATE THAT'S

02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.886
RIGHT THERE ARE SOME BEVERAGES

02:18:47.952 --> 02:18:51.122
THAT THAT BOTTLE CAN HAVE 1100%

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:52.824
RECYCLED CONTENT BUT THERE ARE

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:55.593
CARBONATED DRINKS WHERE THE THAT --

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.662
CONSISTENCY OF THAT BOTTLE MUST

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:59.431
BE DIFFERENT BASED ON THE FDA

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:05.036
STANDARDS AND SO ALL BEVERAGES

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:06.471
ARE NOT COULD CREATED THE COOL

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:07.906
THE EXAMPLES WERE YOU KNOW SOME

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.474
OF OUR OUR OUR DRINKS THAT KIND

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:10.942
OF OUR WATER OR OTHER PRODUCTS

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.211
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TYPE

02:19:13.278 --> 02:19:13.511
OF PRODUCT.

02:19:13.578 --> 02:19:15.513
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TIME LINES

02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:18.183
ARE CONCERNING HERE SOME OF THE

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:20.051
CONTRACTS ARE. TWO IN THREE

02:19:20.118 --> 02:19:21.319
YEARS OUT WE DON'T HAVE AN

02:19:21.386 --> 02:19:23.021
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THERE AND SO

02:19:23.088 --> 02:19:24.789
EVEN IF WE CAN LAND ON A NUMBER

02:19:24.856 --> 02:19:26.591
OR A TIME MIND WE ALSO THINK

02:19:26.658 --> 02:19:27.025
THAT.

02:19:27.092 --> 02:19:28.693
PRICE GOUGING CONCERN SHOULD BE

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.495
CONSENT LAID OUT IN THE BILL AND

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:32.063
THOSE PROTECTION SHOULD BE IN

02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:32.964
THERE THERE SHOULD BE --

02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:34.966
CONSPIRE AS CONCESSIONS FOR

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:37.068
COMPANIES LIKE COCA COLA WHO

02:19:37.135 --> 02:19:38.770
HAVE PLANT BASED PRODUCTS THAT

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:40.205
ARE NOT PUTTING AS MUCH VIRGIN

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:42.006
INTO THE TO THE SYSTEM AND THAT

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:43.775
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN ART LAID

02:19:43.842 --> 02:19:43.975
OUT.

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:46.044
IN HERE AS WELL AND SO AND

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:48.113
LASTLY -- THERE SHOULD BE AN

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:50.081
OPPORTUNITY TO AVERAGE IT ACROSS

02:19:50.148 --> 02:19:51.182
THE PORTFOLIO BECAUSE ALL

02:19:51.249 --> 02:19:52.650
BEVERAGES ARE NOT THE SAME.

02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:55.353
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE

02:19:55.420 --> 02:20:00.792
IN OPPOSITION.

02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:02.026
DENNIS I'LL BE ON A ON A BEHALF

02:20:02.093 --> 02:20:03.828
THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS BUT

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:05.330
THE ABA REPRESENT OF LAID OUT A

02:20:05.396 --> 02:20:07.832
VERY GOOD -- SET THAT THIS IS

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:10.568
JUST COMPLETELY IN FEASIBLE THE

02:20:10.635 --> 02:20:12.103
TIME LINES ARE NOT -- COULD NOT

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:13.404
BE MAD AND IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT

02:20:13.471 --> 02:20:16.207
THE BIG LARGE MANUFACTURERS

02:20:16.274 --> 02:20:18.076
THERE'S ALSO -- YOU THINK ABOUT

02:20:18.143 --> 02:20:19.544
ALL THE STORE BRANDS THE BELL

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:21.079
THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURES BE ABLE

02:20:21.146 --> 02:20:22.680
TO GET TO THAT FIRST STEP --

02:20:22.747 --> 02:20:24.582
WHICH IN THIS BILL IS NEXT YEAR

02:20:24.649 --> 02:20:26.851
REQUIRE ONE YEAR FOR COMPLIANCE

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:28.286
SO THOSE ARE AREAS THAT THAT

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.788
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:20:29.854 --> 02:20:30.588
I THINK ALSO THERE'S ALSO

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:32.824
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION THESE

02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:34.492
BOTTLES THE PT THAT.

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:35.393
THAT THE PROPONENTS BROUGHT

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:38.930
FORWARD IS A 1100% RECYCLABLE

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:39.464
BOTTLE.

02:20:39.531 --> 02:20:40.999
AND BY THE WAY THAT THE NATIONAL

02:20:41.065 --> 02:20:41.399
SORT.

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:43.868
WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.203
BUT FOR OUR PET.

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:46.671
OUR PET ACTUALLY THE PRICEY

02:20:46.738 --> 02:20:48.907
RETAINED VERY STRONG VALUE

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:50.875
THROUGHOUT THAT TIME WOULD DUMP

02:20:50.942 --> 02:20:53.011
A FEW MONTHS AND BOUNCE BACK UP

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:53.912
TO EQUILIBRIUM.

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:55.747
SO OUR PET IS A DIFFERENT

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:57.182
MATERIAL BASED ON DIFFERENT.

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:58.950
AND NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL

02:20:59.017 --> 02:21:00.718
MARKETS.

02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:02.187
AND SO.

02:21:02.253 --> 02:21:03.221
WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS TO

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:05.757

02:21:05.824 --> 02:21:07.492
SUBSTITUTION SITUATION WE HAVE

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:09.093
THINGS LIKE THIS THIS CAME OUT

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:11.429
OF THE SIX OF FLOOR CAFETERIA.

02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:13.765
THIS IS NOT A WILD IS PAPER IT

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:15.834
IS LINED WITH A WITH A LINER

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:17.302
THAT IS NOT RECYCLABLE IT HAS A

SECOND MATERIAL IN HERE WHICH IS

A PLASTIC PRODUCT.

02:21:20.338 --> 02:21:21.773
AND SO THIS IS A VERY ON

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:23.875
RECYCLABLE UP.

02:21:23.942 --> 02:21:26.077

RECYCLED CONTENT AS THE MOST OF

02:21:35.587 --> 02:21:36.654
THE THE THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE

02:21:36.721 --> 02:21:37.555
ALREADY.

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:38.690
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF

02:21:38.756 --> 02:21:40.758
FEASIBILITY TIMING LIKE SAY ONE

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.160
MORE THING SO MARCH TWENTY

02:21:42.227 --> 02:21:43.461
SEVENTH THE THE E. U..

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:45.730
LAID OUT THEIR STANDARDS AND

02:21:45.797 --> 02:21:46.631
THEY STUDY THIS FOR SEVERAL

02:21:46.698 --> 02:21:48.299
YEARS THEY LOOKED AT IT VERY

02:21:48.366 --> 02:21:51.035
INTENTLY AND THEIR STANDARDS ARE

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:52.837
25% BY.

02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:53.471
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THEY GIVE%

A FIVE SIX YEAR A GLIDE PATH ON

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:55.740
THAT.

02:21:55.807 --> 02:21:58.643
AND THEN THEY ARE 30% BY.

02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:59.878
TWENTY THIRTY THEY ALSO HAVE A

02:21:59.944 --> 02:22:03.081
GOAL -- REQUIREMENT OF OF 90% OF

RECYCLING.

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:05.617
AND SO THEY HAVE A MUCH BETTER

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:07.352
RECLAIMING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:08.319

02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:20.391
GUESS MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT.

02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:21.025
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S THAT'S

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:22.460
A PRETTY FAST TURN AROUND TIME

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:25.096
AND ALSO ABOUT THE U. RIGHT TO

02:23:25.163 --> 02:23:26.631
THE YOU HAVE STUDIED THIS.

02:23:26.698 --> 02:23:27.765
AND SO I GUESS.

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:29.300
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT AND

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:31.536
THEN TO THE OPPOSITION WITH THE

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:33.671
E. U. MODEL B. DO YOU THINK

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:34.939
THAT'S MORE FEASIBLE.

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:38.409
SO SO HOT HAPPY -- TO WE DON'T

02:23:38.476 --> 02:23:39.243
HAVE HAD THAT INITIAL MEETINGS

02:23:39.310 --> 02:23:40.945
WITH THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:42.347
IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD WHAT WERE

02:23:42.413 --> 02:23:45.583
HAPPY AND OPEN -- TO BOTH

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:46.884
DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES AS WELL

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:47.919
DIFFERENT TIMELINE.

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:50.822
WE LOOKED AT THE KEY YOU MODEL --

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:53.291
WE THINK IT'S IT'S WORTH TAKING

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.993
A LOOK AT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.961
WE YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOOK AT

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:58.162
OURSELVES A SORT OF LEADING NOT

02:23:58.229 --> 02:23:59.764
NECESSARILY FOLLOWING.

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:01.666
SO THE FACT THAT THE E. U. --

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:03.735
HAS SET A BENCHMARK I THINK IS

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:04.736
GOOD BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:06.437
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO JUST

02:24:06.504 --> 02:24:07.739
ACCEPT.

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:09.707
THE 30% BY TWENTY THIRD I MEAN

02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:12.310
TO THE 25% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

02:24:12.377 --> 02:24:12.677
AS WELL ROUTE.

02:24:12.744 --> 02:24:14.178
THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD BE MORE

02:24:14.245 --> 02:24:15.713
AGGRESSIVE IN THE HOPE IS THAT

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:17.415
ONCE YOU GET INTO THIS.

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.584
PRACTICE OF RECYCLING BIN I

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.019
THINK IT COULD REALLY PICKS UP A

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:21.719
LOT OF STEAM.

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:24.322
I THINK THE OTHER PIECE -- JUST

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:25.556
JUST TO GO FOR A COUPLE COUPLE

02:24:25.623 --> 02:24:26.524
DIFFERENT PIECES.

02:24:26.591 --> 02:24:27.325
IN TERMS OF NESTLE NESTE IS

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:34.665
ALREADY COMMITTED TO I BELIEVE

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:36.501
50% BUT BY.

02:24:36.567 --> 02:24:37.301
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE ALSO MR

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:39.203
BIONDI I'LL BE ON A HAD THE HERE

02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:40.204
WILL LOOKS LIKE A SMALL MILK

02:24:40.271 --> 02:24:41.672
CARTON -- IN IN CERTAIN PLACES

02:24:41.739 --> 02:24:42.840
THAT IS COMPOSTABLE AT FAULT YOU

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:43.741
CUT OUT THE PLASTIC PIECE OF IT

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:44.008
SO AGAIN.

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:45.076
THAT ACTUALLY IS COMPOSTABLE IS

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:47.678
NOT NOT JUST NOT IT'S NOT JUST --

02:24:47.745 --> 02:24:49.747
RECYCLABLE IS COMPOSTABLE SO --

02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:52.050
IT ALSO WITH THE THE OGIC OF

02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:54.252
THE BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION IS SORT

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:56.287
OF LIKE -- A VERY ODD TYPE OF

02:24:56.354 --> 02:24:57.822
MATH THAT WAS SORT OF BEING USED

02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:59.524
IN TERMS OF WELL BECAUSE YOU

02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:00.625
CAN'T.

02:25:00.691 --> 02:25:02.360
GET BACK EVERY SINGLE BOTTLE

02:25:02.427 --> 02:25:04.495
THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY.

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:06.297
RECEIVE GET A 100% WELL WHAT'S

02:25:06.364 --> 02:25:07.832
ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS IN DOUBT

02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:09.133
NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT GETTING BACK

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.735
IN THE BOTTLE FOR ACTUALLY USING

02:25:10.802 --> 02:25:12.703
MORE AND MORE AND MORE PLASTIC

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.072
BOTTLES OUT THERE.

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:15.273
THAT THAT'S A BIGGER ISSUE THE

02:25:15.339 --> 02:25:16.474
BIGGER ISSUE IS IS.

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:18.443
THE USE OF PLASTIC BOTTLES IS

02:25:18.509 --> 02:25:20.244
FRANKLY NOT SUSTAINABLE NOTHING

02:25:20.311 --> 02:25:22.113
BEFORE LANDFILLS NOT SUSTAINABLE

02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:23.981
FOR OUR OCEANS NOT SUSTAINABLE

02:25:24.048 --> 02:25:24.615
FOR OUR STATE I THINK.

02:25:24.682 --> 02:25:25.983
IT'S REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:29.387
HOW DO WE GET THOSE -- GET THAT

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:36.060
QATAR RECYCLED AND RE USE IN IT

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:36.661
TO TRY TO BE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:39.230
ABOUT.

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.231
IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY THE

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:42.366
YIELD.

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:45.203
PERSPECTIVES I'M SORRY.

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.971
YEAH RIGHT WHEN WE MIND THAT WAS

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:47.438
A PROJECT.

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:48.372
WELL I I WAS JUST ASKING IF THE

02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:49.907
OPPONENTS.

02:25:49.974 --> 02:25:50.708
ARE OKAY WITH THE WHAT.

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:53.511
IF THEY THINK THAT IS A MORE

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:55.513
REASONABLE.

02:25:55.580 --> 02:26:02.820
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE LEFT.

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:03.688
SO WE HAVE A GROCERY

02:26:03.754 --> 02:26:04.989
MANUFACTURERS WITH THE BRANDED

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:06.090
FOOD COMPANIES -- WE THINK THE

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:08.593
25% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS IS

02:26:08.659 --> 02:26:10.761
A LIVE IS A YEAH A GOOD WRAP UP

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:11.362
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTRACT

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:12.029
WOULD LOOK AT THE PHASE WHEN YOU

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:13.164
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL.

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:14.532
AND I IN THAT 30% BY TWENTY BY

02:26:14.599 --> 02:26:17.235
TWENTY THIRTY IS IS ABSOLUTELY

02:26:17.301 --> 02:26:19.370
MAYBE WE COULD EVEN DO BETTER.

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:20.171
THANK YOU MAY HAVE PERMISSION

02:26:20.238 --> 02:26:21.439
JUST TO GO INTO THAT TOO WE WILL

02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:23.307
BE A BUSINESS BY THEN.

02:26:23.374 --> 02:26:26.077
LITERALLY WE'VE ALREADY LOST.

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:28.312

STUFF WE LIKE IT WE ENCOURAGE IT.

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:57.108
WE DON'T EMBRACE THE U. MODEL

02:26:57.175 --> 02:26:57.975
WITH THE GUYS WERE STUDYING.

02:26:58.042 --> 02:26:59.076
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A

02:26:59.143 --> 02:27:00.311
LOT OF ELEMENTS TO THAT PROPOSAL

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:02.847
THAT'S WORTHY OF FURTHER REVIEW --

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:04.682
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:05.750
RECLAIMER IS WITH THE

TANG.

02:27:36.581 --> 02:27:38.783
WITH THE THE THE LITTLE CARTON

02:27:38.849 --> 02:27:41.652
I'M UP I AM A SERIOUS RECYCLE

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.654
SEC RECYCLER CYCLER -- PERSON

02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:44.288
WHO RECYCLES.

02:27:44.355 --> 02:27:45.790
BUT I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS VERY

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:46.424
DIFFICULT TO DO AND OUR AVERAGE

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:47.992
PERSON WHO RECYCLES IS NOT GOING

02:27:48.059 --> 02:27:50.328
TO TAKE A PART THAT THAT CARTON

02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:52.096
I MEAN I I DO IT SOMETIMES AND I

02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:53.664
HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETIMES I DON'T

ALWAYS PULL IT ALL APART AND

02:27:54.865 --> 02:27:55.233
THEN.

02:27:55.299 --> 02:27:57.568
AND THEN WE HAVE THE PROBLEM

02:27:57.635 --> 02:27:59.136
THAT LED TO THE NATIONAL SORT.

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:01.172
TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND IT'S A

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:01.806
COMPLICATED ISSUE THAT WE'RE ARE

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:04.208
GRAPPLING WITH.

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:06.477
MS EGGMAN I'M SORRY MISS GARCIA

02:28:06.544 --> 02:28:06.777
[inaudible]

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:10.548
OKAY -- WE SAW -- ASSEMBLY

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.817
MEMBER GONZALEZ HERE RECENTLY

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.519
PRESENTING HER BILL DEALING WITH

02:28:15.586 --> 02:28:17.388
WITH PLASTICS AND I I TOLD HER

02:28:17.455 --> 02:28:18.823
AND HER SPONSORS THAT IF THIS IS

02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:19.457
THE APPROACH WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:28:19.523 --> 02:28:21.025
DEALING WITH PLASTIC THAT WE

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:24.929
NEEDED TO HAVE -- A BILL SIMILAR

02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:26.964
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WILL SAY

02:28:27.031 --> 02:28:29.800
THOUGH I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

02:28:29.867 --> 02:28:32.136
WHETHER OR NOT THE TARGET OF A

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.671
100% IS FEASIBLE.

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:35.473
IN IN THIS BILL.

02:28:35.539 --> 02:28:37.074
AND SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.110
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

02:28:39.176 --> 02:28:40.144
STAKEHOLDERS.

02:28:40.211 --> 02:28:41.612
BEFORE THIS COMES TO THE FLOOR

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:43.180
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S

02:28:43.247 --> 02:28:45.416
THAT'S FEASIBLE.

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:47.818
IN GENERAL PRACTICALITY SPEAKING

02:28:47.885 --> 02:28:49.220
ONCE WE START TO GET PAST THE

02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:51.122
THIRD NUMBER FINISHINGS BECOME

02:28:51.188 --> 02:28:54.158
EITHER TOO EXPENSIVE -- AND AND

02:28:54.225 --> 02:28:55.626
I THINK YOU CAN GET A PRETTY

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:56.594
HIGH NUMBER.

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:57.662
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE E.

02:28:57.728 --> 02:28:59.797
U. MODEL AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:28:59.864 --> 02:29:00.564
30% IS HIGH ENOUGH IN ALL

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:01.032
HONESTY.

02:29:01.098 --> 02:29:03.034
ON AND SO YOU KNOW BUT I DO

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.636
QUESTION WHETHER 1100% IS USABLE

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:06.771
FOR ALL THESE PRODUCTS AND WE

02:29:06.837 --> 02:29:08.072
HAVE PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT ARE

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:11.309
AN EXAMPLE ARE READY 290%.

02:29:11.375 --> 02:29:12.076
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:13.477
THINKING ABOUT.

02:29:13.544 --> 02:29:15.179
ABOUT IT -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF

02:29:15.246 --> 02:29:16.447
IT'S TIED TO OUR RECYCLE

02:29:16.514 --> 02:29:18.049
CONTINENT WHERE WAS TO PRODUCE

02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:19.550
OR SOMETHING ELSE AND HOW YOU

02:29:19.617 --> 02:29:21.352
GET TO THAT NUMBER I I APOLOGIZE

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:21.886
THAT I'M NOT GIVING YOU A

02:29:21.952 --> 02:29:23.387
SOLUTION.

02:29:23.454 --> 02:29:24.622
THAT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:25.856
MOVING FORWARD BUT FOR TODAY I

02:29:25.923 --> 02:29:26.791
AM.

02:29:26.857 --> 02:29:28.426
READY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TO

BE REACHED THAT CAN BE PUT IN

02:43:13.416 --> 02:43:14.484
THE RECYCLE.

02:43:14.551 --> 02:43:16.920

SO I'M JUST CURIOUS.

02:43:22.459 --> 02:43:24.594
RATHER THAN A BAN WHY NOT MORE

02:43:24.661 --> 02:43:28.064
OF A FOCUS ON AN EDUCATION.

02:43:28.131 --> 02:43:29.799
CAMPAIGN.

02:43:29.866 --> 02:43:30.767
WELL.

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:31.768
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION A

02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:33.737
COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT POINT.

02:43:33.803 --> 02:43:35.472
ONE IS THAT WE KNOW ESPECIALLY

02:43:35.539 --> 02:43:37.908
THE SMALLER A PIECE OF PLASTIC

02:43:37.974 --> 02:43:38.909
GETS THE LESS LIKELY THAT IT

02:43:38.975 --> 02:43:41.378
DOES ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED AND

02:43:41.444 --> 02:43:41.611
BACKED.

02:43:41.678 --> 02:43:43.380
UP AND AND A SUMMER STYLE HE'S

02:43:43.446 --> 02:43:44.548
OVER THERE THAT.

02:43:44.614 --> 02:43:46.249
THIS BILL IDEA CAME BECAUSE IT

02:43:46.316 --> 02:43:47.050
WAS A SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING

02:43:47.117 --> 02:43:49.452
THAT A SIMILAR STONE WAS --

02:43:49.519 --> 02:43:50.620
HOLDER THE HELD IN SANTA CRUZ

02:43:50.687 --> 02:43:52.856
NEVER DIFFERENT -- IDEAS AS TO

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:53.890
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS COULD

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:55.659
REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTIC USAGE

02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:57.060
THAT ENDS UP IN THE WASTE STREAM

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:58.528
AND IN THE OCEANS.

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:00.163
AND THIS WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:01.731
MOST MORSE BUT MOST POSSIBLY

02:44:01.798 --> 02:44:03.400
BECAUSE NOT JUST THE SIZE BUT

02:44:03.466 --> 02:44:05.869
THE VOLUME OF THE AMOUNT OF THEM.

02:44:05.936 --> 02:44:07.837
IS SO LARGE THE DAD A NOTE IN AN

02:44:07.904 --> 02:44:09.472
INORDINATE INORDINATE A NUMBER

02:44:09.539 --> 02:44:11.441
OF THEM ARE ENDING UP IN THE WAY

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:12.642
STE NOT IN THE WAIST PROPER

02:44:12.709 --> 02:44:14.377
WASTE AND RECYCLING STREAM.

02:44:14.444 --> 02:44:16.012
BUT ENDING UP IN OUR RIVER WAYS

02:44:16.079 --> 02:44:17.981
AND OUR WATERWAYS AND INTO THE

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:18.748
OCEAN.

02:44:18.815 --> 02:44:21.885
SECONDLY OF THE WE HAVE THIS

02:44:21.952 --> 02:44:23.019
LARGER CONVERSATION -- SUMMER

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.654
GONZALEZ AND OTHERS HAVE BILLS

02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:26.556
REGARDING SINGLE USE PLASTICS IF

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:27.891
WE'RE REALLY GOING TO TACKLE THE

02:44:27.958 --> 02:44:29.292
ISSUES IN THESE PLASTICS WE HAVE

02:44:29.359 --> 02:44:29.559
TO FIND.

02:44:29.626 --> 02:44:31.328
AREAS WHERE WE CAN REDUCE THEIR

02:44:31.394 --> 02:44:34.297
USE AND I BELIEVE THAT HOTELS UP

02:44:34.364 --> 02:44:35.699
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THE

02:44:35.765 --> 02:44:37.200
INDUSTRY ON ITS OWN WITHOUT ANY

02:44:37.267 --> 02:44:38.335
LEGISLATION.

02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:40.370
IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IS

02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:41.905
ABSOLUTELY LOW HANGING FRUIT TO

02:44:41.972 --> 02:44:45.542
REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:48.678
OUR IN -- IN OUR STATE -- AGAIN

02:44:48.745 --> 02:44:49.746
YOU KNOW MERRY OUT BY ITSELF BY

02:44:49.813 --> 02:44:50.714
THE END OF THIS YEAR AND IN

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:51.715
NORTH AMERICA WILL HAVE WELL

02:44:51.781 --> 02:44:53.316
OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES --

02:44:53.383 --> 02:44:55.185
BUT ENDED THIS YEAR -- WELL

02:44:55.252 --> 02:44:56.886
BEFORE ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE

02:44:56.953 --> 02:44:59.489
WOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE OF OF OF

02:44:59.556 --> 02:45:01.291
OF REMOVING SO THEY USE PLASTICS

02:45:01.358 --> 02:45:02.525
AND THEIR TOILETRIES.

02:45:02.592 --> 02:45:04.628
AND SO IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY A

02:45:04.694 --> 02:45:07.430
MATTER OF WHETHER SOMETHING CAN

02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:09.165
BE RECYCLED OR NOT.

02:45:09.232 --> 02:45:10.533
IT'S A MATTER OF HOW DO WE

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:11.668
ULTIMATELY BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:45:11.735 --> 02:45:13.703
THERE'S A PRODUCTION COSTS AS

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.038
WELL TO CREATING PLASTIC THAT AB

02:45:15.105 --> 02:45:16.439
HAD TO CONTRIBUTE TO GREENHOUSE

02:45:16.506 --> 02:45:18.074
GAS EMISSIONS AND CRUDE JOBS TO

02:45:18.141 --> 02:45:18.508
WASTE.

02:45:18.575 --> 02:45:20.277
AND SO IF WE CAN REDUCE THE

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:22.245
OVERALL AMOUNT OF PLASTIC IS

02:45:22.312 --> 02:45:23.747
PARTICULARLY SINGLE USE.

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:25.749
I THINK THAT IT IT HITS A LOT OF

02:45:25.815 --> 02:45:35.292
DIFFERENT GOALS WE HAVE OKAY BUT

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:35.925
YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT KIND OF

02:45:35.992 --> 02:45:37.594
STAND ABOUT WHICH IS THAT THE

02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:38.695
INDUSTRY IS REALLY ALREADY

02:45:38.762 --> 02:45:39.329
TAKING THIS UPON THEMSELVES. TO

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:39.929
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS SO WHY

02:45:39.996 --> 02:45:40.497
THEN DO WE NEED GOVERNMENT

02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:40.830
INTERVENTION.

02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:41.998
IF IT'S WORKING.

02:45:42.065 --> 02:45:43.400
WELL IT'S A COUPLE REASONS ONE

02:45:43.466 --> 02:45:44.701
IS GAS INDUSTRY IS MOVING IN

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:46.102
THAT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF SOME

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:46.836
OF THE BRANDS.

02:45:46.903 --> 02:45:48.672
I THINK THAT WITH LEGISLATION

02:45:48.738 --> 02:45:50.573
NOT ONLY CAN WE PAYS IT OUT ALL

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:51.875
TOGETHER WHICH I THINK IS A A

02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:53.777
NOBLE COLIN OF OF APPROPRIATE

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:55.278
GOAL IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY.

02:45:55.345 --> 02:45:57.213
BUT BY HAVING LEGISLATION WE CAN

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:58.214
ALSO.

02:45:58.281 --> 02:45:59.816
HELP IN WORKING WITH THE LODGING

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:01.051
ASSOCIATE HOW AND ACTIVELY WITH

02:46:01.117 --> 02:46:02.552
THOSE INDEPENDENT HOTELS THAT

02:46:02.619 --> 02:46:03.887

WANT TO I'VE MET WITH I MET WITH

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:09.192
SO MANY OF THEM.

THEY WANT TO THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:15.899
SUPPORT SYSTEM TO DO IT WITH THE

02:46:15.965 --> 02:46:18.601
BILL NOT ONLY CAN WE IT'S NOT

02:46:18.668 --> 02:46:19.235

IN THESE PLASTIC BECAUSE THAT

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:26.409
GOAL IN ITSELF IS A GOOD GOAL SO

02:46:26.476 --> 02:46:27.811

WELL FOR ONE OF THE AREAS THAT.

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:34.784
WERE ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

YEAR FOR SMALLER HOTELS.

I THINK THAT ADDITIONAL YEAR

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:53.937
ALLOWS THE ASSOCIATION -- AND

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:25.862
THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:48:25.929 --> 02:48:29.466
TRYING TO DO -- NO IT WE A LOT

02:48:29.532 --> 02:48:31.234
OF US GREW UP WITH THIS -- YOU

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:34.103
KNOW RECYCLE REDUCE REUSE.

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:35.438
BIND SCHOOLS AND NOW IT JUST

02:48:35.505 --> 02:48:36.673
SEEMS LIKE WE JUST WANT TO GET

02:48:36.739 --> 02:48:39.075
RID OF ANYTHING THAT COULD BE A

02:48:39.142 --> 02:48:41.211
RECYCLED PRODUCT ON JUST BECAUSE

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:46.850
IT'S BAD -- OR OR SOMEBODY DEEMS

02:48:46.916 --> 02:48:48.651
THAT BAD -- YOU KNOW I THOUGHT

02:48:48.718 --> 02:48:50.854
THE THE WHOLE PURPOSE -- THE

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:52.455
EARLIEST -- FOR FOR THE

02:48:52.522 --> 02:48:54.190
MILLENNIALS ON MY GENERATION

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:56.593
THAT WE GOT -- INSTITUTIONALIZED

02:48:56.659 --> 02:48:59.496
IN IN -- SCHOOL WAS TO RECYCLE

02:48:59.562 --> 02:49:01.364
ON NOT TO GET RID OF SO WHY

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:03.733
AREN'T WE FOCUSING ON RECYCLING

02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:05.969
THESE PRODUCTS AND SAY HAVE THE

02:49:06.035 --> 02:49:08.371
HOTELS -- HAVE RECYCLE BINS

02:49:08.438 --> 02:49:11.808
THERE IN THE ROOMS TO CAPTURE

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:14.477
THAT OR THE YOU KNOW ON SPENT

02:49:14.544 --> 02:49:16.079
SHAMPOOS CAN GO TO HOMELESS

02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:17.814
SHELTERS WERE HAVING AN ISSUE

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.983
GETTING PRODUCTS THERE I MEAN

02:49:20.049 --> 02:49:20.617
THERE'S A HUNDRED ONE THINGS WE

02:49:20.683 --> 02:49:21.484
CAN DO.

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:24.087
BUT I I FEEL LIKE WE'RE JUST

02:49:24.153 --> 02:49:25.622
TRYING TO SAY OKAY THIS IS BAD.

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.757
LET'S GET RID OF IT YOU KNOW IN

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:29.058
THE I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH OF

02:49:29.125 --> 02:49:30.360
THAT FLOW AROUND UP HERE I I

02:49:30.426 --> 02:49:31.661
APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE LOOK

02:49:31.728 --> 02:49:33.296
YOU KNOW I GREW UP JUST LIKE YOU

02:49:33.363 --> 02:49:34.397
DID LEARNING ABOUT RECYCLING WE

02:49:34.464 --> 02:49:35.465
TAUGHT OUR PARENTS HOW TO DO IT

02:49:35.532 --> 02:49:36.065
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GROW UP.

02:49:36.132 --> 02:49:37.500
WITH THAT AND THE PART OF THE

02:49:37.567 --> 02:49:39.135
REASON IS THAT POSSIBLE

02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:40.503
LIBERATED DURING OUR UPBRINGING

02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:42.071
IN A WAY THAT WE HAD NEVER SEEN

02:49:42.138 --> 02:49:43.273
BEFORE NOW WE KNOW WHAT THOSE

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:44.374
IMPACTS ARE.

02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:45.542
THIS IS AN EVOLUTION IT'S AN

02:49:45.608 --> 02:49:47.210
EVOLUTION RECOGNIZING IS NOT

02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:48.811
JUST ABOUT ABOUT RECYCLING

02:49:48.878 --> 02:49:50.947
PLASTICS BUT WE HAVE TO START

02:49:51.014 --> 02:49:52.582
ARE WE AT THE START TO PHASE AS

02:49:52.649 --> 02:49:53.383
MUCH THE MOTHER THAT'S PACKED

02:49:53.449 --> 02:49:54.851
THAT'S PRACTICAL.

02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:57.053
THAT MAKES SENSE -- SECONDLY AND

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.354
THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARNED A

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:00.056
LOT ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN THIS

02:50:00.123 --> 02:50:00.857
HOUSE A CITY COUNCIL IN A MANY

02:50:00.924 --> 02:50:02.225
OF YOUR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

02:50:02.292 --> 02:50:02.759
AND WHEN I VISIT RECYCLING

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:05.395
PLANTS IF THERE ARE CONTAMINANTS --

02:50:05.461 --> 02:50:06.963
THAT THEIR OF THEIR CONTAMINANTS

02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.597
WHICH A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS

02:50:07.664 --> 02:50:10.199
WOULD HAVE AS FAR AS RECYCLING

02:50:10.266 --> 02:50:10.867
IS CONSIDERED.

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:12.569
THE END OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT

02:50:12.635 --> 02:50:13.836
RECYCLE THEY ACTUALLY JUST PUT

02:50:13.903 --> 02:50:15.171
INTO LANDFILL AND SO THAT'S

02:50:15.238 --> 02:50:16.205
ANOTHER ISSUE NOT AND I'LL GIVE

02:50:16.272 --> 02:50:23.546
YOU AN EXAMPLE ABOUT IS

02:50:23.613 --> 02:50:25.014
EDUCATION ENOUGH.

02:50:25.081 --> 02:50:25.915
PLASTIC.

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:26.649
BAGS AT THE GROCERY STORES I

02:50:26.716 --> 02:50:27.150
KNOW I'M SURE WE HAVE A

02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:27.784
DIFFERENT OPINION ON ON WHETHER

02:50:27.850 --> 02:50:28.585
THAT WAS A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY

02:50:28.651 --> 02:50:29.519
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT PRO. TWO

02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:30.086
TO THREE DECADES THERE WAS A

02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:31.187
EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT YOU WERE

02:50:31.254 --> 02:50:32.088
ABLE TO TAKE YOUR PLASTIC BAGS

02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:32.889
BACK THE GROCERY STORE THEY

02:50:32.956 --> 02:50:34.290
WOULD TAKE IT BACK.

02:50:34.357 --> 02:50:35.391
THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE JUST

02:50:35.458 --> 02:50:38.494
DIDN'T DO IT AND SO THE THOUGH

02:50:38.561 --> 02:50:40.063
OF THE REAL THE REAL.

02:50:40.129 --> 02:50:41.898
OF THE THE REAL MOVE THAT HAD TO

02:50:41.965 --> 02:50:43.232
BE MADE WAS JUST ABANDONED

02:50:43.299 --> 02:50:44.300
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GETTING IN

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:45.868
THE RECYCLING STREAM THERE ARE

02:50:45.935 --> 02:50:47.136
GETTING IN THE WAY STREAM.

02:50:47.203 --> 02:50:48.738
NOW AGAIN I KNOW YOU MAY NOT

02:50:48.805 --> 02:50:49.839
AGREE WITH THAT.

02:50:49.906 --> 02:50:51.407
THAT CONCLUSION BUT THAT'S AN

02:50:51.474 --> 02:50:52.942
EXAMPLE OF HOW IT'S NOT JUST

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:54.477
ENOUGH TO HAVE A RECYCLING BIN

02:50:54.544 --> 02:50:56.846
OR HAVE A PROGRAM THAT ACCEPTS

02:50:56.913 --> 02:51:00.717
BACK TO THE RECYCLING SO THAT IS.

02:51:00.783 --> 02:51:02.552
SO YEAH SO.

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:03.853
WANT ONE MORE QUESTION MANAGERS

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:05.622
IF.

02:51:05.688 --> 02:51:06.556
WE'RE WE'RE SO FOCUSED ON SINGLE

02:51:06.623 --> 02:51:07.690
USE SMALL PLASTICS AND WHAT

02:51:07.757 --> 02:51:09.626
ABOUT LIKE THE INK PEN THAT

02:51:09.692 --> 02:51:11.294
YOU'RE HOLDING IN YOUR HAND.

02:51:11.361 --> 02:51:13.496
NO I MEAN IS THAT IS THAT NEXT

02:51:13.563 --> 02:51:14.297
ON THE CHOPPING THIS WAS CARE AT

02:51:14.364 --> 02:51:17.867
ALL SINGLE USING PENS AND WELL%

02:51:17.934 --> 02:51:19.602
OF AT THE LOOK THE REALITY IS

02:51:19.669 --> 02:51:21.571
THIS AND I I UNDERSTAND I MEAN I

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:22.939
AM I MEAN A LITTLE FACETIOUS.

02:51:23.006 --> 02:51:24.273
I GET IT I I'VE IT BUT I MEAN WE

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:25.875
WE KEEP GOING AFTER.

02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:27.844
YOU KNOW ONE SMALL PLASTIC AFTER

02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:30.213
ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER AFTER

02:51:30.279 --> 02:51:33.182
ANOTHER. ONE IS IN STOCK WELL

02:51:33.249 --> 02:51:34.083
ABOVE WHAT WE DO THIS AND GET

02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:35.284
RID OF HALF A BILLION A YEAR.

02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:36.753
THAT'S NOT HOW MUCH OF THAT IS

02:51:36.819 --> 02:51:38.121
ACTUALLY COMING FROM CALIFORNIA

02:51:38.187 --> 02:51:39.455
VERSUS OTHER PLAYER THAT'S

02:51:39.522 --> 02:51:41.424
CALIFORNIA ALONE THAT THAT'S CAL.

02:51:41.491 --> 02:51:42.792
IT'S A VERY ROUGH LIKE NAPKIN

02:51:42.859 --> 02:51:44.193
CALCULATION BUT BASED UPON THE

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:46.462
DATA OF THE HOW MANY ROOMS AND

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:47.864
HOW MANY PLASTIC BOTTLES OF THE

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:48.631
ROOMS.

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:51.768
AND SO -- BUT IT DOES MATTER IT

02:51:51.834 --> 02:51:52.835
DOES ADD UP I MEAN WE DON'T.

02:51:52.902 --> 02:51:54.871
WE'RE IN THE WERE IN THE PROBLEM

02:51:54.937 --> 02:51:56.305
THAT WERE IT WE WERE HAVING A

02:51:56.372 --> 02:51:57.440
PROBLEM IN THE CRISIS RIGHT NOW

02:51:57.507 --> 02:51:58.608
WITH THE PLASTICS.

02:51:58.675 --> 02:52:00.009
BECAUSE IT'S CONSERVATIVE AND SO

02:52:00.076 --> 02:52:01.310
YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE

02:52:01.377 --> 02:52:03.112
DO ONE THING OVER JUST TO THAT

02:52:03.179 --> 02:52:03.746
ONE THING WHICH IS IN THE OTHER

02:52:03.813 --> 02:52:04.847
THING AHLERS SANTA SOUNDS LIKE A

02:52:04.914 --> 02:52:09.318
LOT OF OF ABILITY TO RECYCLE AND

02:52:09.385 --> 02:52:10.586
AND REVIEWS.

02:52:10.653 --> 02:52:12.055
ARE WE WE ARE YOUR YOUR I HATE

02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:13.156
YOU YEAH WELL RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:52:13.222 --> 02:52:13.756
HAVING A BILL WE'RE HAVING A

02:52:13.823 --> 02:52:14.824
PROBLEM WITH RECYCLING PLASTIC

02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:16.626
BECAUSE CHINA'S DECIDED TO STOP

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:18.261
TAKING OUR RECYCLABLES.

02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:20.396
AND SO PART OF IT IS YES HAVING

02:52:20.463 --> 02:52:21.898
OUR OWN HOME GROWN ABILITY TO

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:23.966
RECYCLE AND PART OF IT IS

02:52:24.033 --> 02:52:25.301
REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION OF

02:52:25.368 --> 02:52:26.502
SIMPLY IS PLASTICS.

02:52:26.569 --> 02:52:34.010
AND SO WE HAVE TO DO IT ALL IS

02:52:34.077 --> 02:52:34.610
THAT THERE'S NOT ONE ANSWER TO

02:52:34.677 --> 02:52:36.412
IT.

02:52:36.479 --> 02:52:37.146
A SIGNAL MORE COMMON SIDE ARE

02:52:37.213 --> 02:52:37.814
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL --

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:38.448
THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE SOMETHING

02:52:38.514 --> 02:52:39.382
IS RECYCLABLE THAT IT'S OFF THE

02:52:39.449 --> 02:52:40.049
HOOK WHEN WE KNOW BECAUSE WE SIT

02:52:40.116 --> 02:52:40.717
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HEAR IT

02:52:40.783 --> 02:52:41.684
OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THESE

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:44.387
PRODUCTS ARE NOT BEING RECYCLED.

02:52:44.454 --> 02:52:45.755
THEY'RE EITHER BEING LAND FILLED

02:52:45.822 --> 02:52:46.989
OR IF THEY GO OVERSEAS SOMETIMES

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:48.357
ARE BEING BURNED.

02:52:48.424 --> 02:52:49.592
AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:50.626
IN THE OCEAN AND WHEN DOES IT

02:52:50.693 --> 02:52:52.161
END ENDS WHEN WE STOP PULLING

02:52:52.228 --> 02:52:53.296
WELLS OUT OF THE OCEAN.

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:54.263
WHO ARE DEAD BECAUSE OUR

02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:55.665
STOMACHS ARE FILLED WITH PLASTIC

02:52:55.732 --> 02:52:58.267
THAT THEY CAN'T DIGEST SO?

02:52:58.334 --> 02:53:00.603
REDUCING THE SOURCE OF ALL OF

02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:01.938
THIS POLLUTION IS GOING TO BE A

02:53:02.004 --> 02:53:03.072
HUGE PART OF THE EQUATION AND

02:53:03.139 --> 02:53:04.173
THIS SEEMS TO ME LIKE LOW

02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.441
HANGING FRUIT.

02:53:05.508 --> 02:53:06.175
I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT

02:53:06.242 --> 02:53:08.277
FORWARD I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION

02:53:08.344 --> 02:53:09.378
IS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I

02:53:09.445 --> 02:53:09.879
DON'T KNOW.

02:53:09.946 --> 02:53:11.247
HOW TO THE PACE CONTAINERS

02:53:11.314 --> 02:53:12.582
FIGURE INTO THIS GIVEN THAT

02:53:12.648 --> 02:53:13.850
THERE MIGHT BE SOME SANITARY

02:53:13.916 --> 02:53:15.251
ISSUES SO JUST THINK ABOUT ALL

02:53:15.318 --> 02:53:16.152
THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AS YOU

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:17.086
MOVE FORWARD?

02:53:17.153 --> 02:53:18.688
BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT

02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:20.690
YOUR BILL TODAY.

02:53:20.757 --> 02:53:21.591
AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:53:21.657 --> 02:53:22.291
CLOSE.

02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:24.093
YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR

02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:26.095
THE SUPPORT -- AND I'LL JUST DO

02:53:26.162 --> 02:53:27.997
A QUICK ON WE'RE NOT CUTTING TO

02:53:28.064 --> 02:53:28.931
PLEASE BECAUSE NOT IT'S NOT AS

02:53:28.998 --> 02:53:30.867
STANDARD YOU WALK IN EVERY HOTEL

02:53:30.933 --> 02:53:31.434
ROOM YOU DON'T SEC TWO BASE

02:53:31.501 --> 02:53:32.301
THERE.

02:53:32.368 --> 02:53:33.269
AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:53:33.336 --> 02:53:35.037
POSITIVE A KIND OF ISSUE WITH

02:53:35.104 --> 02:53:36.672
CONTAMINANTS RAPID.

02:53:36.739 --> 02:53:38.007
PROCESS I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

02:53:38.074 --> 02:53:40.243
DOES NOT INTEND TO COVER TO PAY

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:41.210
JUST JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO

02:53:41.277 --> 02:53:42.779
EVERYONE BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE

02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:44.380
QUESTION BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

02:53:44.447 --> 02:53:45.715
KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT COME UP

02:53:45.782 --> 02:53:46.549
THAT WE TALK ABOUT WITH THE

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:47.416
INDUSTRY.

02:53:47.483 --> 02:53:48.718
ARE THOSE DETAILS BECAUSE THE

02:53:48.785 --> 02:53:50.620
THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS WHEN

02:53:50.686 --> 02:53:52.121
IT COMES TO A BILL LIKE THIS IS

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:52.622
GOOD IMPACT SO MANY.

02:53:52.688 --> 02:53:54.390
HOTEL ROOMS AND HOTELS THAT WANT

02:53:54.457 --> 02:53:55.725
TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:57.026
INDUSTRY HAS PROVEN THAT YOU'VE

02:53:57.093 --> 02:53:58.561
SEEN IT WITH THE BUT THE TOWEL

02:53:58.628 --> 02:54:00.296
ON THE BED SHE CLEANING WHEN

02:54:00.363 --> 02:54:02.365
THEY HAVE SIGNS ALL BUT IT SEEMS

MODEST USE OF RENEWABLE NATURAL

THEY CAN GET OFFSETS FOR THE

03:01:09.525 --> 03:01:10.859
PURCHASE OF THAT SOLAR POWER

03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:12.695
REGARDLESS OF OF WHERE THAT

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:14.063
POWER IS GENERATED AND PUT ON TO

03:01:14.129 --> 03:01:16.165

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:31.880
WE THINK THAT THIS WAS A HUGE

03:01:31.947 --> 03:01:33.549
BENEFIT TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO

03:01:33.616 --> 03:01:35.084

PRODUCE OIL AND GAS.

03:01:57.906 --> 03:01:59.908
IN A WAY THAT REDUCES RGH TWO

03:01:59.975 --> 03:02:02.077

TRY TO PRODUCE MORE GASOLINE OR

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:11.020
CRUDE OIL FROM CALIFORNIA THAT'S

03:02:11.086 --> 03:02:12.788
SIMPLY A DEMAND QUESTION THIS

03:02:12.855 --> 03:02:14.256

QUICKLY THE BENEFITS OF METHANE

03:02:26.635 --> 03:02:27.836
ARE HUGE.

03:02:27.903 --> 03:02:29.938
IF WE CAN USE MECHANIC METHANE

03:02:30.005 --> 03:02:31.573
STREAM INSTEAD OF USING A FOSSIL

03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:34.510

NATURAL GAS ND BY DOING SO

03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:18.514

THAT SOME FIELDS ARE DEVELOPING.

03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:35.097
SUCH AS USING SOLAR STEAM TO

EXTRACT AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IT

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:38.000

DISCOURAGE THE TRANSITION TO NON

03:04:42.137 --> 03:04:43.505
IN AREAS THAT NEED THAT

03:04:43.572 --> 03:04:45.407

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:01.056
INSTEAD THIS BILL WOULD LOCK

COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGIES.

03:05:03.292 --> 03:05:04.726
THE STATE NEEDS TO WEAN ITSELF

03:05:04.793 --> 03:05:06.462
OFF OF ITS DEPENDENCE ON GAS AND

03:05:06.528 --> 03:05:08.897
THIS BILL WOULD WORK IN

03:05:08.964 --> 03:05:10.532
OPPOSITION TO THAT THANK YOU.

03:05:17.105 --> 03:05:18.907
MISTER MATHIS.

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:21.043
YOU KNOW I I ALWAYS FIND IT

03:05:21.109 --> 03:05:22.177
INTERESTING SO TALK ABOUT

03:05:22.244 --> 03:05:23.846
WINNING PEOPLE OF A GAS EVEN

03:05:23.912 --> 03:05:25.180
THOUGH WE HAVE ALL THIS NATURAL

03:05:25.247 --> 03:05:26.982
NATURAL GAS OCCURRING IN THE

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:29.151
ABILITY TO CAPTURE IT AND USE IT

03:05:29.218 --> 03:05:32.287
AND GET IN THE PIPELINE -- YEAH

03:05:32.354 --> 03:05:34.223
I'VE GOT A VERY DISADVANTAGED

03:05:34.289 --> 03:05:37.259
DISTRICT IN WE WE HAVE A AREA

03:05:37.326 --> 03:05:39.261
AND I I WON'T CALL THE THE TOWN

03:05:39.328 --> 03:05:43.232
OUT BY NAME -- BUT THE RESIDENTS

03:05:43.298 --> 03:05:46.235
ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPTION. TO GET

03:05:46.301 --> 03:05:48.136
FREE SOLAR.

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:49.805
AND SWITCH ALL OF THEIR

03:05:49.872 --> 03:05:53.208
APPLIANCES OVER TO ELECTRIC.

03:05:53.275 --> 03:05:56.411
THEY REFUSED THE FREE OFFER OF

03:05:56.478 --> 03:05:59.014
SOLAR ELECTRIC APPLIANCES.

03:05:59.081 --> 03:06:01.517
BECAUSE THEY PREFER THE ABILITY

03:06:01.583 --> 03:06:04.853
TO USE GAS STOVES.

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:06.121
AND INSTEAD HAVE BEEN

03:06:06.188 --> 03:06:09.024
ENCOURAGING THE LOCAL AREA -- TO

03:06:09.091 --> 03:06:12.661
TEAM UP WITH OUR GAS COMPANIES

03:06:12.728 --> 03:06:15.664
AND OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY PLANT

03:06:15.731 --> 03:06:17.165
THAT'S ACTUALLY CAPTURING

03:06:17.232 --> 03:06:19.034
METHANE FROM DERRY DIGEST

03:06:19.101 --> 03:06:22.671
STATION -- TO USE THAT NATURAL

03:06:22.738 --> 03:06:25.073
NATURAL GAS -- AS A MATTER.

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:26.808
ID AND I BELIEVE THIS WOULD

03:06:26.875 --> 03:06:29.511
ACTUALLY LOWER THE COST -- QUITE

03:06:29.578 --> 03:06:31.013
SIGNIFICANTLY.

03:06:31.079 --> 03:06:32.581
OF THAT NATURAL NATURAL GAS AND

MOST RECENT AMENDED VERSION OF

AB -- FOR TWENTY THREE IN ITS

03:15:58.813 --> 03:16:00.482
PREVIOUS ITERATION WHEN THE BILL

03:16:00.548 --> 03:16:02.016
JUST DEALT WITH GOVERNANCE THE

COUPLE DIFFERENT -- ISSUE AREAS

THE DISTRICT -- THE MANDATES TO

REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE

03:16:24.906 --> 03:16:26.774
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES --

03:16:26.841 --> 03:16:28.376
WEATHER RELATED TO PENDING

03:16:28.443 --> 03:16:30.044

THE FULL FACTS OF THE MATTER

03:16:33.314 --> 03:16:35.650
BEING DETERMINED -- WE ALSO FEEL

03:16:35.717 --> 03:16:37.986
THAT THERE'S WAYS INTERPRET THE

03:16:38.052 --> 03:16:39.521

THERE'S JUST SOME MECHANICAL

04:06:56.768 --> 04:06:58.436
IT DEFIES REASON THAT THE

RECORD SAY THAT -- THIS IS

04:15:11.396 --> 04:15:13.164
REALLY TO BEEF UP THE DEFENSIBLE

04:15:13.231 --> 04:15:15.366
SPACE REQUIREMENTS -- WHOLE --

04:15:15.433 --> 04:15:17.101
HOMES OF REQUIRING THE NEW IS

04:15:17.168 --> 04:15:18.002
BUILDING CENTERS ARE OFTEN

04:15:18.069 --> 04:15:19.971
IGNITION RESISTANT BUT ONLY IF

04:15:20.038 --> 04:15:21.205
THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

04:15:21.272 --> 04:15:22.640
REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.

04:15:22.707 --> 04:15:24.676
AND WHAT'S NEW ABOUT THOSE FIRES

04:15:24.742 --> 04:15:25.777
WITH A LOT OF THE HOUSES THAT

04:15:25.843 --> 04:15:27.211
BURNED WERE NEWER HOUSES THAT

04:15:27.278 --> 04:15:28.746
DID HAVE A LOT OF THE MORE

04:15:28.813 --> 04:15:30.415
RESILIENT A FIRE CODES BUILT

04:15:30.481 --> 04:15:31.716
INTO THEM BUT WHAT WE LEARNED

04:15:31.783 --> 04:15:33.184
WAS THAT THE VEGETATION THAT WAS

04:15:33.251 --> 04:15:35.019
RIGHT WITHIN THE FIVE FOOT.

04:15:35.086 --> 04:15:36.287
THIS FIVE FOOT BUFFER WAS WHAT

04:15:36.354 --> 04:15:38.523
IGNITED THE HOUSES AND THAT WAS

04:15:38.589 --> 04:15:40.925
NOT IN THE CURRENT -- DEFENSIBLE

04:15:40.992 --> 04:15:42.393
SPACE REQUIREMENTS SO THIS

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:43.594
NARROWS IT DOWN TO REALLY TRY TO

04:15:43.661 --> 04:15:45.396
GUIDE PEOPLE TO LOOKING AT THE

04:15:45.463 --> 04:15:46.798
SPACE BETWEEN ZERO AND FIVE FEET

04:15:46.864 --> 04:15:48.466
OF YOUR HOUSE BECAUSE EVEN IF

YOUR YARD DOESN'T BURN YOUR TREE

04:15:50.001 --> 04:15:51.035

04:15:52.203 --> 04:15:53.004
OF YOUR WINDOW.

04:15:53.071 --> 04:15:54.272
THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO BLOW THE

04:15:54.338 --> 04:15:55.873
WINDOW OUT AND ALLOW FIRE TO

04:15:55.940 --> 04:15:57.775
MOVE INTO A HOME SO WE'VE BEEN

04:15:57.842 --> 04:15:59.577

INSTITUTING TO MAKE OUR HOMES

04:16:11.355 --> 04:16:12.623

BEFORE I RECALL AT THIS MAKES

04:19:33.424 --> 04:19:34.558
SENSE IS JUST WONDERING.

04:19:34.625 --> 04:19:36.093
WHO WOULD BE AGAINST THIS AND

04:19:36.160 --> 04:19:37.028
WHAT WHAT WITH THE PUSH BACK IF

WOULD LIKE IT BUT THERE ARE

04:19:42.867 --> 04:19:43.334
OTHER ANY ORGANIZED GROUP

04:19:43.401 --> 04:19:44.368
SERVING ORGANIZATIONS WOULD

04:19:44.435 --> 04:19:45.303
OBJECT TO THIS.

04:19:45.369 --> 04:19:46.671
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY ORGANIZED

04:19:46.737 --> 04:19:48.739
OPPOSITION BUT THIS THIS BILL IS

04:19:48.806 --> 04:19:50.541
REALLY INTENDED TO ALSO WORK

04:19:50.608 --> 04:19:51.742
WITH COMMUNITIES TO EDUCATE THE

04:19:51.809 --> 04:19:53.344
PUBLIC ABOUT THE DANGERS OF

04:19:53.411 --> 04:19:55.513
HAVING -- THIS COMBUSTIBLE

04:19:55.579 --> 04:19:56.681
MATERIALS AROUND THEIR HOMES AND

04:19:56.747 --> 04:19:57.481
CERTAINLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

04:19:57.548 --> 04:19:58.683
SOMEONE WHO HAS YOU KNOW ONE

04:19:58.749 --> 04:20:00.084
SMALL PLANNED AND THEN.

04:20:00.151 --> 04:20:00.751
I'VE BEEN JUST DOING WINDSHIELD

04:20:00.818 --> 04:20:02.086
SURVEYS AND DRIVING AROUND MY

04:20:02.153 --> 04:20:03.220
NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS A HIGH

04:20:03.287 --> 04:20:04.522
FIRE SEVERITY ZONE AND THE

04:20:04.588 --> 04:20:05.423
NUMBER OF HOUSES THAT ARE

04:20:05.489 --> 04:20:06.958
LITERALLY WRAPPED.

04:20:07.024 --> 04:20:10.361
IN FOLIAGE -- YOU KNOW IS A IS

04:20:10.428 --> 04:20:11.595
REALLY ASTOUNDING AND WHEN I

04:20:11.662 --> 04:20:13.097
TALK TO HOMEOWNERS AND YOU KNOW

04:20:13.164 --> 04:20:14.465
I I PUT MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY

04:20:14.532 --> 04:20:15.666
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WHAT THE

04:20:15.733 --> 04:20:16.767
DANGERS THEY JUST DON'T

04:20:16.834 --> 04:20:17.902
UNDERSTAND.

04:20:17.969 --> 04:20:18.536
THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT TO

04:20:18.602 --> 04:20:20.571
HAVE A PLANT TEN FEET AWAY FOR

04:20:20.638 --> 04:20:21.238
YOUR HOUSE IS TO HAVE ONE THAT'S

04:20:21.305 --> 04:20:22.206
LITERALLY.

04:20:22.273 --> 04:20:23.641
RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR YOUR HOUSE

04:20:23.708 --> 04:20:24.508
SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE

04:20:24.575 --> 04:20:26.544
COMMUNITIES USE THIS TO TO GO

04:20:26.610 --> 04:20:27.778
OUT AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC.

04:20:27.845 --> 04:20:29.680
AND START TO SORT OF IDENTIFY

04:20:29.747 --> 04:20:31.115
THOSE HOMES ARE MOST AT RISK AND

04:20:31.182 --> 04:20:32.516
SEND THEM NOTICES THE WAY THEY

04:20:32.583 --> 04:20:33.818
DO WITH OTHER TYPES OF HAZARD

04:20:33.884 --> 04:20:39.657
AND BRUSH CLEARANCE ISN'T AND

04:20:39.724 --> 04:20:42.526
GET THE WORD OUT.

04:20:42.593 --> 04:20:43.995
THIS ONE IS.

04:20:44.061 --> 04:20:45.830
THANK YOU OKAY SO NIGHT TWO

04:20:45.896 --> 04:20:48.065
QUESTIONS -- ONE IS.

04:20:48.132 --> 04:20:48.699
I I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN

04:20:48.766 --> 04:20:49.567
YOUR COMMENTS BUT THERE IS

04:20:49.633 --> 04:20:51.569
ALREADY -- A PENALTY ASSOCIATED

04:20:51.635 --> 04:20:53.170
WITH NOT HAVING THIS DEFENSIBLE

04:20:53.237 --> 04:20:55.606
SPACE YOU'RE SAYING -- IT'S

04:20:55.673 --> 04:20:56.941
DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE.

04:20:57.008 --> 04:20:58.242
YOUR SHORTENING.

04:20:58.309 --> 04:21:00.077
THEAMOUNT OF SPACE IN BETWEEN

04:21:00.144 --> 04:21:01.846
THE HOME AND AND FOLIAGE CORRECT

04:21:01.912 --> 04:21:03.347
WELL THERE'S TWO DIFFERENCES THE

04:21:03.414 --> 04:21:04.715
FIRST IS THAT THERE IS NO THE

04:21:04.782 --> 04:21:06.751
CURRENTLY IS ZERO TO FIVE

04:21:06.817 --> 04:21:08.219
DEFENSIBLE SPACE ZONE.

04:21:08.285 --> 04:21:09.754
SO THIS DOES CREATE A NEWS ON

04:21:09.820 --> 04:21:11.989
BASED ON WHAT WE SAW IN THE LAST

04:21:12.056 --> 04:21:13.991
COUPLE OF FIRES AND SECONDLY

04:21:14.058 --> 04:21:14.658
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A CIVIL

04:21:14.725 --> 04:21:16.394
PENALTY AND LEAN AUTHORITY BUT

04:21:16.460 --> 04:21:18.095
HELL FIRES NEVER USED IT HOWEVER.

04:21:18.162 --> 04:21:19.663
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT

04:21:19.730 --> 04:21:20.798
SO THIS CREATES AN

04:21:20.865 --> 04:21:22.867
ADMINISTRATIVE -- REMEDY FOR

04:21:22.933 --> 04:21:24.468
THEM BUT AGAIN WITH THE GOAL

04:21:24.535 --> 04:21:26.737
TOWARDS GETTING COMPLIANCE --

04:21:26.804 --> 04:21:28.506
YOU KNOW NOT TO WHAT DO YOU MEAN

04:21:28.572 --> 04:21:30.875
BY THE MINISTRY OF ROMANI AND I

04:21:30.941 --> 04:21:36.514
UNDERSTAND.

04:21:36.580 --> 04:21:40.384
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY THROUGH

04:21:40.451 --> 04:21:42.319
AN ALLERGY PROCESS.

04:21:42.386 --> 04:21:43.120
RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A

04:21:43.187 --> 04:21:43.721
PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN HAVE

04:21:43.788 --> 04:21:44.588
ADMINISTRATIVE CIVIL PENALTY

04:21:44.655 --> 04:21:45.189
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO

04:21:45.256 --> 04:21:45.823
COURT TO DO IT THEY'RE STILL A

04:21:45.890 --> 04:21:46.457
PROCESS AND THEY'RE STILL AWAY

04:21:46.524 --> 04:21:47.124
FOR THE HOMEOWNER TO RESPOND BUT

04:21:47.191 --> 04:21:48.325
IT'S THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE

04:21:48.392 --> 04:21:51.996
COURT SYSTEM TO DO IT.

04:21:52.063 --> 04:21:53.831
OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT

04:21:53.898 --> 04:21:55.933
THEY'VE HAD THIS ABILITY TO

04:21:56.000 --> 04:21:57.535
PLACE A LIEN ON THE HOME THEY

04:21:57.601 --> 04:21:58.602
HAVE THAT NOW.

04:21:58.669 --> 04:22:00.271
THEY JUST NEVER USE IT AND SO

04:22:00.337 --> 04:22:02.106
YOUR OBJECTIVE LEAST PARTIALLY

04:22:02.173 --> 04:22:03.307
IN THIS BILL IS TO MAKE IT

04:24:20.211 --> 04:24:21.645
INVESTMENT THAT THEY'VE MADE.

04:24:21.712 --> 04:24:22.913

04:24:37.461 --> 04:24:39.129
OF THE STUFF OUT IS EXTREMELY

04:24:39.196 --> 04:24:41.565
COSTLY ESPECIALLY IF IT'S RIGHT

04:24:41.632 --> 04:24:42.233
NEXT TO THE HOUSE.

04:24:42.299 --> 04:24:43.000
THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ROOT

04:24:43.067 --> 04:24:44.635

04:25:00.117 --> 04:25:01.986
IN.

04:25:02.052 --> 04:25:03.287
I MEAN FIXING A FOUNDATION IS A

04:25:03.354 --> 04:25:04.688
NIGHTMARE.

04:25:04.755 --> 04:25:05.456
SO IF YOU'RE GONNA GO START

04:25:05.522 --> 04:25:06.991
PULLING STUFF OUT.

04:25:07.057 --> 04:25:08.959
I MEAN IS THIS CAN QUICKLY GOING

04:25:09.026 --> 04:25:11.161
TO THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT

04:25:11.228 --> 04:25:12.896

YOU CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING WITHIN

04:25:18.636 --> 04:25:20.571
THE FIVE FEET WE THE BILL

04:25:20.638 --> 04:25:23.741
DIRECTS -- THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW

04:25:23.807 --> 04:25:25.242
EXPERTS SORT OF COTTON SORT OF

04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:26.944
WELL I'M A LOOK AT WHAT EXACTLY

04:25:27.011 --> 04:25:28.045
WE SHOULD BE RECOMMENDING BUT

04:25:28.112 --> 04:25:30.581
ALSO TO FOCUS ON SORT OF THE

04:25:30.648 --> 04:25:31.982
MOST FLAMMABLE MOST DANGEROUS

04:25:32.049 --> 04:25:33.350
MATERIALS.

04:25:33.417 --> 04:25:34.418
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IS

04:25:34.485 --> 04:25:36.020
EXPENSIVE IS REMOVING THIS

04:25:36.086 --> 04:25:37.354
MATERIAL WITHIN FIVE FEET FOR

04:25:37.421 --> 04:25:38.555
YOUR HOUSES IT'S NOT GONNA BE

04:25:38.622 --> 04:25:40.190
NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS REPLACING

04:25:40.257 --> 04:25:41.425
YOUR HOUSE IF IT BURNS DOWN IN A

04:25:41.492 --> 04:25:42.159
FIRE.

04:25:42.226 --> 04:25:44.094
SO THERE IS A YOU KNOW KIND OF A

04:25:44.161 --> 04:25:45.829
RISK ANALYSIS THAT HOMEOWNERS

04:25:45.896 --> 04:25:46.930
NEED TO BE DOING WHEN THEY LOOK

04:25:46.997 --> 04:25:47.898
AT THIS AND IF YOU.

04:25:47.965 --> 04:25:49.767

YOU'RE ALREADY LIVING AT A HIGH

04:25:54.471 --> 04:25:55.339
FIRE.

04:25:55.406 --> 04:25:56.874
SEVERITY ZONE WHICH THIS BILL

04:25:56.940 --> 04:25:58.309
ONLY IMPACTS.

04:25:58.375 --> 04:25:59.977
YOU REALLY NEED TO DO THAT COST

04:26:00.044 --> 04:26:01.645
BENEFIT US AND BENEFIT ANALYSIS

AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SOMEONE

04:26:03.447 --> 04:26:04.682
WHO GETS NOTICE WAS A COUPLE OF

04:26:04.748 --> 04:26:06.116
PLANTS IS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT IF

04:26:06.183 --> 04:26:06.950
YOU'VE GOT.

04:26:07.017 --> 04:26:08.886
A REALLY FLAMMABLE TREE RIGHT UP

04:26:08.952 --> 04:26:09.687
AGAINST YOUR HOUSE.

04:26:09.753 --> 04:26:10.921
PEOPLE REALLY DO NEED TO BE PUT

04:26:10.988 --> 04:26:12.856
ON NOTICE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT

04:26:12.923 --> 04:26:14.591
REALIZE HOW HAZARDOUS THAT IS

04:26:14.658 --> 04:26:16.327
THEY JUST DON'T NOW SO A LOT OF

04:26:16.393 --> 04:26:18.062
THIS IS ABOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE

04:26:18.128 --> 04:26:19.463
SO THAT THEY CAN NO AYE THOSE

04:26:19.530 --> 04:26:21.031
KINDS OF ANALYSIS YOU TO DO THAT

04:26:21.098 --> 04:26:22.533
DO THAT ANALYSIS AND SELF.

04:26:22.599 --> 04:26:24.868
ABSOLUTELY BUT THE MEN WERE ALSO

04:26:24.935 --> 04:26:28.472
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE

04:26:28.539 --> 04:26:29.940

04:26:30.007 --> 04:26:31.141
SAYING THAT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD

04:26:31.208 --> 04:26:32.242
TO PAY THEIR OWN TRAFFIC TICKETS.

04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:33.110
SO HOW SHOULD WE EXPECT THEM TO

04:26:33.177 --> 04:26:37.181
REMOVE TREES THERE ARE -- FIRE --

04:26:37.247 --> 04:26:39.350
RESPONSIBILITY -- AREAS THAT

04:26:39.416 --> 04:26:41.585
HAVE COME UP WITH WAYS OF

04:26:41.652 --> 04:26:43.220
INCENTIVIZING AND FINANCING LOW

04:26:43.287 --> 04:26:45.089
INCOME HOMEOWNERS TO REMOVE

04:26:45.155 --> 04:26:46.990
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE

04:26:47.057 --> 04:26:48.492
ARE CITIES THAT DO THAT AS WELL

04:26:48.559 --> 04:26:50.494
WHERE THEY HAVE FOR LOW INCOMES --

04:26:50.561 --> 04:26:53.364
HOMEOWNERS AND SENIORS -- ALL

04:26:53.430 --> 04:26:54.698
KINDS OF HAZARD ABATEMENT

PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO

04:26:56.800 --> 04:26:58.235
THERE ARE LOCAL INCENTIVE

04:26:58.302 --> 04:27:00.404
PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN MANY PLACES

04:27:00.471 --> 04:27:01.972
AND I CERTAINLY WOULD SUPPORT.

04:27:02.039 --> 04:27:03.173
MEASURES TO INCREASE THE

04:27:03.240 --> 04:27:05.542
AVAILABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DO ALL

04:27:05.609 --> 04:27:07.211
KINDS OF HOME HARDENING --

04:27:07.277 --> 04:27:08.379
