CONDUCTING THE HEARING IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC. IN OUR EMPLOYEES. TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC ACCESS WE'VE ADMITTED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO TWO HEARING ROOMS TO THE EXTENT THE SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS ALLOW.

I'M BURKE HERE NIELSEN IF HERTZBERG LABOR HERE EARN. WE HAVE HERE. THANK YOU NAM I THINK EVERYONE'S- DID EVERYONE HAVE ON THEIR THEIR MICROPHONE WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE HERE SO WE COULD PROPERLY RECORDED. I THINK SO OKAY I DID NOT OF I'M HERE AT SEVEN HILLS AND THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. ALL RIGHT NOW WITHOUT FURTHER DO WILL BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING WITH TWO BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA. SB ELEVEN SIXTY THREE BAR VICE CHAIR CENTER NIELSEN. IN OUR COMMITTEE BILL SB NINE SEVENTY WHICH IS ON CONSENT OF. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO AHEAD AND- LET'S THE- LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AND ONLY AUTHOR CENTER NIELSEN ON YOU MAY PRESENT SB ELEVEN SIXTY THREE AND IF YOU CARE TO PRESENT FROM THE DÃ­AS I THINK THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE YEAH LET'S DO THAT. AT ALL. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- BUT COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. THE CONCERN OF MOTIVATING THE BILL IS. THE INTERACTION OF CITIZENS. WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE MOVING BALLOTS AROUND IT IS LIMITED TO THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. AND THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY BE THE DURATION OF THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION. IT'S MOTIVATED BY A SIMPLE QUESTION. DO WE WANT TO HAVE STRANGERS GOING DOOR TO DOOR. WITH BALLOTS. THAT ENHANCES THE EXPOSURE. OF INDIVIDUALS TO THOSE WHO WOULD BE COMING AND DOOR TO DOOR. WHO HAVE NO REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED ON THEM TO CERTIFY THAT THEY ARE AUTHORIZED OR CAPABLE OF. DOING THIS COLLECTION OF BALLOTS. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE EXPOSED TO AS HIS THEIR HOUSEHOLD. POSSIBILITIES OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING IN FACT DOOR TO DOOR THEY ARE STRANGERS. AND NOT HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED IN ANY MANNER OR WAY. TO COLLECT THE BALLOTS DOOR TO DOOR. THE STANDARD IMPOSED BY THE LEGISLATION. IT WOULD BE. THE NEWER STANDARD. IN THE LATE THE VALLEY VOTE BYMAIL AND VOTER WHO CANNOT RETURN THEIR BALLOT CAN DESIGNATE NOW A SPOUSE CHILD PARENT A GRANDPARENT. CONSANGUINITY I THINK IS OF FAMOUS BORDER THE FANCY WORD FOR THAT BUT THERE'S A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. A CO HABITANT. IS ALSO. ON THAT LIST. BOB RISE IN. TO CONVEY THAT BALLOT. PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS SOMETHING THAT- IS EVIDENT RIGHT HERE IN THIS HEARING TODAY AND HOW WE ARE ALL IN SOCIETY OF BITING. THIS BILL RETURNS CALIFORNIA TO THE LONG HAUL L. STANDARD. THAT WOULD BE ONLY DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY. IT WOULD BE HELD. AND THAT WOULD BE I ARGUE THE POLL THE FRANCHISE OF THE VOTERS AND FACILITATE THEM WITH THE MAXIMUM. OF PROTECTION. FROM THIS DISEASE THAT WE ARE NOW SO UNFORTUNATELY CONTENDING WITH. IT'S VERY SIMPLE AND AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH DISH AND COLLEAGUES IT IS CONFINED TO THIS NOVEMBER. THE GENERAL ELECTION IT WOULD BE A TEST TO SEE THE EFFICACY BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT. THE TEN BUT NOT CAN I THREE ANY ARGUMENT. THAT THIS WOULD NOT MORE PROTECT OUR INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS THAT THIS VERY CRITICAL TIME. BY LIMITING THE CUP TO PEOPLE ANY PEOPLE. TO COME TO THEIR DOOR WITH THAT IN HIS FOR GAYS CERTIFICATION OF THE HEALTH OR ANYTHING ELSE. THAT IS A SIMPLE BILL DISCOUNT. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN- DUE TO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING LENGTHY HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND NEW CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEES WILL INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON ALL TESTIMONY ACCORDINGLY EACH SIDE WILL BE LIMITED TO A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES ALL THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS THEIR NAME. AFFILIATION A POSITION ON THE MEASURE- I UNDERSTAND THAT- MISS RUTH WEISS WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA IS YOUR WITNESS SENATOR NIELSEN THAT IS CORRECT- AND IF MISS WEISS IS ON THE PHONE THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO PROCEED. MISS WHITE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU TO NEAR YES I CERTAINLY AM AND I APPRECIATE THE HONOR OF TALKING WITH YOU TODAY- I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SUBMITTED A PETITION LETTER IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR NIELSEN BILL. AND BOB BEFORE I ENTER INTO MY COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CONTENT OF THAT LETTER. I DON'T IN WE CAN ASK COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THE END OF THE THEN NEW TESTIMONY IF THEY'VE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T. YEAH BE GREAT OKAY WELL IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD IT IS SINCE I CAN'T BE YOUR BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN UNDER NDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR WHOLE LIVES HAVE BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IN FEBRUARY OR BEGINNING OF MARCH AND WE'RE CONTINUING. TO CONDUCT OURSELVES IN A VERY ABNORMAL WAYS HERE- I'M AND KNOWING THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CURE OR VACCINE IN TRYING TO HELP US OUT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION CYCLE. ARE GOVERNED. ON MAY BE AT THE STAFF OF A AN EXECUTIVE BOARD THAT CHANGED- THE WAY IN WHICH BALLOTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED SO THAT NOW EVERY. REGISTERED VOTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE ABOUT BY MAIL BALLOT IN THIS IS TO. MAKE SURE NO ONE GETS A LAST MINUTE DEFEND FRIDAY IN FRANCHISE SITUATION DUE TO AN INABILITY LAST MINUTE OR OR- OF GOING OUT. TO VOTE REGULARLY I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR REALIZED THAT SOME VOTERS ARE GOING TO NEED ASSISTANCE OR SOME OTHER OF LAST MINUTE. SO HE HAS. PROVIDED FOR JUST SET THAT UP A WELL. BY A- LOT OF THAT THE DOW. OF WHAT HE IS DOING THE FIRST VOTERS. IN THE THIRD. TIME SENATOR NIELSEN BILL ADDRESSES ONE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS THAT IS NOT COVERED. BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ARMED AND THAT IS THAT- EVEN IF HEART INFECTION RATES HAVE SUBSIDED CONSIDERABLY BY OCTOBER WHEN THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE SENT OUT. IT IS STILL TRUE THAT A VERY. ATION BUT ARE MOST AT RISK NOW OF ILLNESS AND. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THE POP. THAT ARE ARE THE ONES MOST. HAVE BALLOT COLLECTORS TO US THEM. AND I CAN. THE THAT STATUS QUO AND NINETEEN TWENTY ONE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES- I WILL ECHO WHAT SENATOR NELSON SAID IS THAT WE SUBJECT THEM. TO PERSON TO PERSON CORD. YEAH WHICH IS ANTITHESIS OF WHAT WE WANT TO GET A PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. ILL OR WHO ARE. ELDERLY OR IN SOME OTHER WAY ACCEPTABLE TO THE PARTICULAR CONTAGION THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE I. T. C. H. AND MAKE SURE THAT. THE ORDER HAS A VOTE AND- VOTE IN A WAY IN WHICH THAT VOTER DESIRES- AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT NO DISENFRANCHISEMENT WOULD TAKE PLACE WELL WE'RE A CALL. THAT UNDER THE- YEAH CONSIDERATION. SB ELEVEN SIXTY THREE THAT THAT'S CARE OF FIRST OF ALL EVERY REGISTERED VOTER WILL BE MAILED THE FINAL BALLOT THAT HAS A RETURN ENVELOPE THAT IS POSTAGE PAID BACK NINETY NINE POINT 9% ANYONE WISHING USING BALLOT. PUT IT IN MY ON THEIR POOR THE OF THEIR DRAW THE AND THAT SHOULD BE. VERY EASY PROCESS FOR ANYONE WISHING TO VOTE. ON AND THEN IN ADDITION AS SENATOR NELSON OF POINTED OUT THIS BILL ALSO STILL ALLOWS THOSE WHO NEED THE ASSISTANCE AND THE HELP OF SOMEONE RETURNING ABOUT FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON A FAMILY MEMBER OR A MEMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD TO DO THAT. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE'S ANY DOWNSIDE AT ALL CHIU THEIR- BILL AND YET THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT. FIGHT AND IDEAS CONTINUED PROTECTION ON BOTH TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE. TO THIS PANDEMIC BUT WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT NOW SO I WOULD LIKE TO.

CONSEQUENCE OF THE- ELECTION I THINK THAT WAS. EARLY ON IN OUR IN OUR TESTING MEDICAL. THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACE ANYTHING BACK WITH ANY RELIABILITY THAT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT IN TIME SO I THINK. IT WOULD BE PRETTY IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW. BUT ABOUT THAT TIME IS WHEN. THE EXPLOSION OF THE- I REYES BEGAN YOU KNOW NATIONWIDE. AND IN SOME PLACES MORE THAN OTHERS SO IT IS LOGICAL LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT ANY PLACE INCLUDING. VOTING LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY THAT THERE WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PASS ALONG. SOME SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY- DISEASE. BUT I AND I AM AWARE OF A VERY SUCCESSFUL BALLOT HARVESTING IS THE TERM IS APPLIED. EFFORT TO- IN IN MY OWN ELECTION WHERE THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS THAT WERE- PICKED UP BY OTHERS IN RETURN DIVERSE FISCAL OPERATION FISSION OPERATION VERY EFFECTIVE OPERATION- AND- IS I UNDERSTAND UNDER THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE.

I CONSIDERED AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE- CUT REQUIRE THOSE WHO CAME DOOR TO DOOR. TO COLLECT BALLOTS WOULD HAVE A MASK AT LEAST. THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPUR CERTIFIED ANYWAY SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS COLLECTING YOUR BALLOT. OR WHERE IT'S GOING. TO WHERE IT WILL BE DEPOSITED. AND THEY ARE NOT INFORMED AS TO WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF THE THEY HAVE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE BALLOT HAS BEEN IMPROPERLY PLACED. EVEN LOST. THIS IS BUILT UPON A UNIMPEACHABLE LOGIC THESE ARE TRYING TIMES THE VIRULENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR MALADIES THIS VIRUS. HAS IN A VERY SHORT TIME. AFFECTED THE ENTIRE WORLD. AND WE AS CITIZENS.
