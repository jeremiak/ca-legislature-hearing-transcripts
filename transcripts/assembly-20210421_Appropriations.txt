GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE WHICH CLOSES LOOPHOLE THE CALIFORNIA'S TRUTH IN LABELING LAWS IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL ESTABLISHES CLEAR GUIDELINES ON WHEN THE ALL OF THE OIL INDUSTRY CAN USE THE TERM CALIFORNIA ON ITS LABELING AND MARKETING. I DO NOT ANTICIPATE IN THE CHAIR OBVIOUSLY CONCURS BECAUSE THIS BILL WAS PROPOSED FOR CONSENT. BUT THIS CLARIFICATION RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COSTS. IN INSIGNIFICANT CROSSES HIS IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE STATES AND I QUOTE. IF ANY ALL OF OIL IS PRODUCED IN PROCESS SOLD OFFERED FOR SALE GIVEN AWAY OR POSSESSING CALIFORNIA THAT INDICATES UNSTABLE CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. OR USES WORDS OF SIMILAR IMPORT THAT INDICATE THE CALIFORNIA IS THE SOURCE OF THE OLIVE OIL A DERIVED FROM OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO PROTECTS REGIONS IN OUR STATE OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE LIKE NAPPING MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. UNFORTUNATELY OUT OF STATE CORPORATIONS PURCHASING CALIFORNIACOMPANIES UTILIZING THE STATE'S GOOD NAME HAVE BEGUN BY PASSING CALIFORNIA STANDARDS ARE REPLACING THEIR OILS WITHOUT OF STATE AN INTERNATIONAL PRODUCT. THE LEGACY NAMES DECEIVE THE CONSUMER AS ANYONE COULD SEE FROM COMPLAINTS FROM AMAZON FROM THOSE MISLED BY LABELING. THE CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL INDUSTRY HAS WORKED HARD TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE MOST STRINGENT QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE WORLD. ALLOWING OUT OF STATE CORPORATE BUYERS TO PROPER FOR MISLEADING LABELS THAT ULTIMATELY DAMAGE THE INDUSTRY IS SOMETHING WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW. WE HAD AN EXTREMELY LENGTHY AND ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THE POLICY IN ASSEMBLY HELP LAST WEEK A SPECIAL MOST ESPECIALLY WITH YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. WHERE THE BILL EMERGED WITH THE THIRTEEN OH BIPARTISAN VOTE. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS INCLUDING THE MEETINGS THAT I'VE ALREADY SCHEDULED. AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO BE HONEST WITH WITH THE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT. AGAIN BECAUSE THIS BILL IS MERELY CLOSING A LOOPHOLE IN THE EXISTING LAW. I AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES SENSE THAT THIS WILL HAVE MINIMAL FISCAL IMPACT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY AND HERE TO TESTIFY IS LOUIS BROWN WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION. OF TRUTH IN ALL OF OUR LABELING AND CAROLINE BEALE HUNTER REPRESENTING YOUR TO DO HERE THANK YOU. KAEL AN OPERATOR WILL GO TO THE- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BERMAN HERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REALLY BROWN CALLING TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ALL OF OIL LATELY OF THE AUTHOR SAID IT WELL THE DALLAS THE POINTS OUT THERE THEY'RE VERY LIMITED- AND MINIMAL FISCAL IMPACTS THIS BILL SO ON THE FISCALLY HUGE WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I COULD BE AVAILABLE.
