AFTER ALL OUR DISCUSSION ITEMS- HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. OKAY WE HAVE TO- BYNUM'S ON TODAY'S AGENDA NOT SMALL ITEMS BUT TWO ITEMS- SO LET'S START WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE IT'S AN INFORMATION- ITEM ON CARBON CAPTURE AND ALL NOTE THAT MULTIPLE SOURCES. AND REPORTS IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF COMMERCIALLY DEPLOYABLE CARBON REMOVAL TECHNOLOGIES- THAT MAY BAR CALIFORNIA FROM REACHING OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL OF TWENTY FORTY FIVE WILL GO INTO A DEEP DISCUSSION ON THAT IS CONTAINED IN OUR STAFF REPORT AND THIS IS EVEN ASSUMING THAT WE- IF WE DON'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CARBON CAPTURE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE A WHOLESALE TRANSITION TO GREEN ENERGY ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS WE STILL WILL MEET OUR OUR CARBON GOALS. SO I THINK WE HAVE THE L. A. O. MISTER BROWN GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR ACROSS FROM AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF SAYS AFTER OFFICE TO PRESENT THIS ISSUE ITEM ON CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE- BEFORE I PROVIDE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS AND THE BUTTON BACKGROUND IF YOU LOOK THROUGH HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT- THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT OUR OFFICE IS DONE ENOUGH ANALYSIS UP AND SO. AS A RESULT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE SOME IMMEDIATE ANSWERS TO ALL THE KIND OF TECHNICAL AND POLICY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WE ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF THAT'S HELPFUL I DO ALSO WANT TO KNOW IT BELIEVES- ENERGY COMMISSION HAVE STAFF ON THE CALL. TO ALSO HOPEFULLY CAN HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE MORE DETAIL THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT THEM OUR HOPE IS ALSO TO HAVE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS PUT ON THE RECORD TO THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU OKAY GREAT SO- THE GOAL MY INITIAL COMMENTS ARE REALLY JUST TO KIND OF SET THE STAGE FOR THE ISSUE AND QUITE A BIT OF CONTACTS SO WITH THAT IN MIND I'M GONNA FOCUS MY COMMENTS IN JUST A FEW MAJOR THINGS FIRST YOU KNOW IT JUST HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS THE C. S. SECOND WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL ROLE FOR CCS AND QUIET MEDITATION. ABSURD WATER SOME OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES AND AN EXISTING POLICIES THAT PROMOTE CCS. THE FIRST- THE TERM CARBON CAPTURE STORAGE OR CCS CAN BE USED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS TO CAPTURE A WIDE RANGE OF POTENTIAL GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES AND STRATEGIES SO I WANT THROUGH SORT OF A FEW OF THOSE BUT I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS ISSUE IS JUST A- SORT OF A MATTER OF TERMINOLOGY AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY SOMETIMES. I THINK MOST COMMONLY OF THE TERM CCS CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS APPLIES TO NOT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE TO THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ADMITTED AT A PARTICULAR FACILITY LIKE A POWER PLANT SO BIOFUEL PLANT OR INDUSTRIAL FACILITY IN SIR CAPTURING THAT CARBON. IN THE ATMOSPHERE. AND STORING SEPHORA OR- IT IN SOME CASES MAKE IT OF FOR. SOME PLANTS- ANOTHER CATEGORY. KNOWN AS KIND OF CARBON AND- ROOM. OR SOME CASES KIND OF NEW EMISSIONS. AND THESE ARE. TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU KNOW DIRECT TAKE- CARPENTER OUT OF. ALSO NOT AT OF PUTS YOU FACILITY BUT KIND OF GET OUT OF AIR- THE IS SOMETIMES KNOWN AS- AFTER CAPTURING SOME- AND THERE'S OTHER- CUT NATURE. SOLUTIONS ARE TECH THAT A COURSE ALSO OF- AND STORE AND SUPPRESS CARBON- SUCH AS KNOW FOR SPANISH CHANGES AND WHAT WHAT ANOTHER LIKE THAT- SO I THINK. MATTER IS GONNA THE BOOK IS A THIS ISSUE THIS ITEM IS NOT MORE ON THE KIND OF TECH. BASED SIDES BUT I JUST WANT TO KIND OF PROVIDE THAT CONTEXT IF THERE ARE A VARIETY OF. TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS THAT KIND OF STUFF SOMETIMES FALL INTO THIS TERMINOLOGY. SECOND JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THE ROLE FOR SOME THESE. PARTICULARLY KIND OF TECH FOCUSED ONES- THEY ARE AS A SURE MENTION KIND OF A OFTENTIMES A MAJOR PART OF MANY OF THE PATHWAYS THAT ARE ANALYZED MEETING. BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL CLIMATE TARGETS- SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF THE SCENARIOS THAT ARE PART OF THE IPCC REPORTS I'M TRYING TO SORT OF NEED- VARIOUS CLIMATE TARGETS INCLUDE CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL AND CCS. SOME OF THE CARDS IN AREAS THAT ARE ANALYZED AS PART OF THE CURRENT SCOPING PLAN PROCESS ASSUME SOME SIGNIFICANCE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL WOULD BE NEEDED- IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE AT LEAST. ARMS AND IN GENERAL THE THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE. INCLUDED IN THESE SCENARIOS- IN PART TO SORT OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE HARD TO DECARBONISE PARTS OF THE ECONOMY SO FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW PROVIDING- OF- ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY- AND KIND OF HIGH PERCENTAGE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GRID. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES CCS IS INCLUDED AS AS AN OPTION FOR- NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS TO TRY TO HELP BALANCE TO GET THE GRADE AND- PROVIDE RELIABLE ELECTRICITY AT SOME OF THOSE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF RENEWABLES RIOS. OTHER TIMES JUST KIND OF FOCUSED ON INDUSTRIAL SECTORS WHICH ARE OFTEN HARD TO DECARBONISE AND THERE AREN'T A LOT OF KIND OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE. SO CCS IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS OFTEN KIND OF HIGHLIGHTED AND IN THAT CONTEXT AND THEN. THINGS LIKE DIRECTOR CAPTURE AND KIND OF OTHER TYPES OF CARBON RENEWABLE. REMOVAL ARE OFF. I DON'T IF I DOES NOT. GETTING A THAT OTHER- AREAS OF THE ECONOMY LIKE ABA. FUEL USE RADIO ARE- ALSO VERY TO BE. AND SO- THERE MIGHT BE A ROLE FOR SOME OF THE SECT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES KIND OF. TO- TO TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO KIND OF OFFSET SOME OF THOSE THOSE EMISSIONS THAT MIGHT REMAIN FOR QUITE AWHILE. SO SERVICE AND FINALLY I REALLY JUST WANNA. PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE BUDGET AND POLICY LANDSCAPE HERE- BURSTS THERE WAS SOME SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR OR SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS FUNDING FOR- DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS- BERMAN CAPTURE AND STORAGE- AT NATIONAL LEVEL TWO POINT FIVE BILLION FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ANOTHER NINE HUNDRED MILLION FOR LARGE SCALE PILOTS. ALSO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR STORAGE TRANSPORTATION OF CARBON- THREE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR DIRECT AIR CAPTURE REGIONAL HUBS- OTHERS ARE JUST SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS A NATURAL PACKAGE- THERE ARE SOME ALSO THEY'RE ALL ALSO IS A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT FOR- CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE I ALSO WANTED TO. RECOGNIZE. THAT AS WELL AND MENTION THAT. EIGHT LEVEL THERE'RE IS FUNDING. RELATED TO SOME OF THE NATURE BASED- SEQUESTRATION SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. PACKAGING OF THE LEGISLATURE- SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR. THINGS LIKE WETLAND RESTORATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT- BUT NOT AS MUCH THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED FOR. A TECHNOLOGY FOCUS KIND OF CAPTURE AND STORAGE PROJECTS. IN CASE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK IS HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S CLEAN ENERGY PACKAGE INCLUDED. ALSO FOR TO LEARN TEN NO. FOUR INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION PROJECTS- AT SOME OF THAT FUNDING COULD BE USED FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND- UTILIZATION ACTIVITIES I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THAT PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED. ARE PROJECTS THAT WOULD JUST- INCLUDE GEOLOGIC STORAGE SO STORING THAT CARBON CARBON ESSENTIALLY UNDERGROUND- THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO. THINK ABOUT- POTENTIALLY SORT OF EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY IN TRYING TO- EXPLORE SORT OF YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT THE MOST. COST EFFECTIVE AND- FEASIBLE OPTIONS ARE FOR STORING CARBON AND- AS TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD SO WANTED LIKE THAT AS WELL THERE ARE LASTLY THERE ARE SOME OTHER. POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S- TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR SONS DCS PROJECTS- MOSTLY FOCUSED ON- PRODUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS THERE'S ALSO IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR. MONEY TO GO TO EVENTUALLY FOR DIRECTOR CAPTURE PROJECTS. SO FINALLY- I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A- BUT THIS IS A TOPIC THAT THERE IS PROPOSED LEGISLATION ON ABOUT RIGHT IT GIVES THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND HOUSE- INDISCRETION OF. ARE THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSIONS IN RECENT YEARS- AND AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC BUDGET PLAN. DOES INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR- CCS PROJECTS. SO I WILL IN MY COMMENTS THERE HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT OF. LOCAL CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE AND- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. YEAH I. ONE QUESTIONS READ YOU WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT D. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THAT THE HARD TO- DECARBONIZING WE'VE HAD HEARINGS HERE IN SUB TO BEFORE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LET'S SEE FOOD PROCESSORS AND IT'S YOU KNOW THEY'VE TESTIFIED THAT THEY REALLY NEED THE PRICE OF CARBON NEEDS TO GET TO BE ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS A METRIC TON BEFORE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO DECARBONISE. AND I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE SOME OPPOSITION TO THE JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA FROM FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE ANY CARBON CAPTURE DID DON'T DISCUSS IT AND ALL THAT BUT WE DO STILL NEED OUR FOOD WITH PEOPLE STILL WANT THEIR BABY LETTUCE IN THE BAG- WOULDN'T THAT BE. AN IDEAL. SECTOR IF YOU WERE GOING TO LOOK AT IF YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT CARBON CAPTURE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF. THE FEDERAL MONEY STEER. AND THEN THEN I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT. THAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A ROAD BLOCK GIVEN THE- ADMINISTRATION'S LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T COME. PUT IT BACK HOUSTON GEOLOGICAL STORAGE IS AN ANSWER EVEN IF EVEN IF. THE LOCATION WAS AYE DELIC. RIGHT FOR CARBON STORAGE THIS IS THAT WERE YOU OR IS IT WORTHY ALEJO. YES SO ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION ON FOOD PROCESSORS I MET I THINK IT- IT SEEMS LIKE THAT COULD BE SORT OF THE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IN THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR I MEAN I DON'T KNOW. ENOUGH ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THERE COULD BE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE AND OTHER TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES COULD WORK BUT I THINK. THE OVERALL POINT AROUND JUST KIND OF INDUSTRIAL SOURCES AND THE TYPES OF HEAT THAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO PRODUCE THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURING. ALSO SEES- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SOME OF THE OTHER STRATEGIES OF THE STATE EMPLOYEES LIKE ELECTRIFICATION THEY MIGHT NOT- WORK IN SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES AND SO LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS LIKE. ARBEN CAPTURE SEEM LIKE THERE- BUT YOU KNOW COULD BE KIND OF ONE WAY TO. TO MOVE FORWARD IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA- IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF AN ADMINISTRATION'S. PROPOSAL THAT WAS PUT FORWARD THAT CAN SORT OF EXCLUDES. GEOLOGIC STORAGE YEAH I MEAN I THINK- GIVEN SORT OF THE SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGE OF MEETING CARBON NEWCREST NEUTRALITY GOALS ANDS- THE KIND OF AMOUNT OF WORK THAT'S NEEDED TO SORT OF TO REACH THOSE GOALS AND MOST LIKELY THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED TO MEET THOSE GOALS OVER TIME WE- HAVING A GENERAL THINK THAT'S- TRYING TO FOCUS RESOURCES AND EFFORTS IN A WAY THAT IS- AS TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE WHERE THE STATE CAN KIND OF EXPLORER- A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT CAN KIND OF HELP IT MEET ITS CLIMATE GOALS- SEEMS LIKE A GOOD. HALF GOING FORWARD NOW THERE MIGHT BE. SOME INSTANCES WHERE- THE LEGISLATURE THE STATE'S SORT OF DETERMINES THAT YOUR PARTICULAR APPROACH GOING FORWARD HAS OTHER TRADE OFFS THAT IT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE IT DOESN'T WANT TO KIND OF SACRIFICE OR OTHER IMPACTS THAT IT AND YOU KNOW IT CONCERNS IT'S- CARES MORE ABOUT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE. OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THIS. KIND OF OUR WAY- SOME OF THOSE OTHER FACTORS THAT I TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL NEUTRALITY THE NIGHT COULD PLAY A ROLE BUT- OVERALL FROM A AT LEAST FROM A PURELY ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE TRYING TO. EXPLORE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD. HELP THE STATE COST EFFECTIVELY MEET SOME OF THE SOME OF THESE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS WE THINK IS A IT IS A GOOD STRATEGY GOING FORWARD. AND THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME GUIDANCE HERE ON YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL HAS THREE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR DIRECT CARBON. DIRECT AIR CAPTURE AND WE KNOW THAT- AS WE GO. I LOOK FOR TO. THIS WERE GOING TO HAVE A CAP TRADE THE WE LOOK AT WHAT THE- IS FOR THAT. THAT REDUCTION AND OUR STAFF REPORT INDICATES IT'S IN THE FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR. LEVEL WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST THAT'S- ALMOST THE SIZE ROOFTOP SOLAR. NOW ROOFTOP SOLAR IS MORE EXPENSIVE BUT JUST KIDDING ALL KIDDING ASIDE- WITH WITH THE- WITH THE NON ATTAINMENT AREAS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN. THE THREE POINT FIVE. BILLION THAT'S SITTING OUT THERE FOR THE- WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN THOUGH IT'S EXPENSIVE GIVEN GIVEN SORT OF YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIA'S ALLEGED OUR REPUTATION IS BEING A LEADER IN TECHNOLOGY WOULDN'T THIS MAKES SENSE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DIRECT SOME OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. TOWARDS MAKING THAT A REALITY AT LEAST IN ONE OF THESE NON ATTAINMENT AREAS I DON'T KNOW WHO'S THE LUCKY LOTTO WINNER WHETHER IT'S LA AND SOUTH COASTERS SAN JOAQUIN OR WHOEVER GETS THE DIRECT CAPTURE BIRD. ISN'T DOESN'T IT MAKE SENSE JUST A THEORETICAL LEVEL THAT WE WOULD PUT MONEY IN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ONE OF THESE PROJECTS IN THE WORST OF THE WORST PLACES THAT HAVE- YOU KNOW- CO TWO PROBLEM. I THINK TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO LEVERAGE- FEDERAL FUNDING IS- IS ONE OF A KIND OF- THANK A TRACTIVE GOT AWAY DISPLACING THINK ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE STATE RESOURCES GIVEN SORT OF THE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. OUT THERE AND SO AS YOU MENTIONED THIS SORT OF DIRECT AIR CAPTURE HOMES CULD BE ONE OF THOSE- EXAMPLES I MEAN I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW SORT OF ENOUGH ABOUT. EXACTLY WHAT THE DIRECTOR CAPTURE HOMES WOULD LOOK LIKE- BUT YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY WOULD FOCUS YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY FOCUSES. ON A CARBON I THINK I'M TAKING CARBON OUT OF THE AIR- AND SO THAT THAT'S REALLY THE- GOAL LESS I'M GONNA BE- LOCAL AIRPORT. SIDE OF THINGS AND SO. NOW WITH WITH HIS LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS AROUND HOW HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES THERE ARE ALWAYS KIND OF A VARIETY OF COMPETING PRIORITIES AND THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AND WHERE TO. WHERE TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS BUT CERTAINLY. THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO USE STATE FUNDING TO THE KIND OF LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING TO HELP ACHIEVE ITS ITS CLIMATE GOALS AS ONE WOULD THINK IMPORTANT. FACTOR TO CONSIDER WHEN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS I THINK YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT TO BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE AIR QUALITY DISCUSSIONS ROUNDS OUT. THE THAT THE CARBON DISCUSSION PEOPLE COME IN AND THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR AIR QUALITY WHICH IS IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING BUT- AS THE- AS THE- STAFF ANALYSIS IN THE STEP ANALYSIS IN THE IN. THE THAT THE NEXT. ISSUE NUMBER TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT THAT. THAT CARBON GOES. IS AROUND THE WORLD- AND IN YOUR IN OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD. ALL RIGHT. DON'T GO AWAY WE HAVE SOME. HINTS HERE AND I'M- SURE MY COLLEAGUES WITH- HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ALSO LET'S GO TO- SIEVERT. GUNDA THE VICE CHAI OF THE- CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON THE LINE FOR. A OF YOUR MANAGER'S. YES- GOOD MORNING AS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M STILL GOING TO VICE CHAIR OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND IF WE ARE VIRGINIA LOU- MANAGER CONNECTING THE COMMISSION TAUGHT IN THE DIVISION AND A CLIENT MANAGER OF THE COMMISSION EXCITING AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH PUTTING THE INFORMATION TODAY I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A FEW COMMENTS ON THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION AND WILL PASS IT ON TO BUT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE. OPENING COMMENTS ON PCS. TWO BIG WITH- CAL HAS. AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PAIN YOU WILL. IN TOP OF OUR PROGRAM INTO THE TWO. TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW. ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN TWENTY TWENTY THE STATEMENT THIRTY FOUR POINT 5% RBS TARGET. AHEAD OF THE 33% PLAN TARGET. HONEST A TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 60% ZERO CARBON- CAN IN TWENTY TWENTY- THAT ZERO CARBON NUMBER FLUCTUATES A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH- HYDRO AND A LEADING WE HAVE. IT IF YOU THESE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM PLAN IS ACTUALIZED WILL BE APPROXIMATELY THAT SEVENTY THREE PERCENT- THE NEW WILL AND EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. GHG FREE RESOURCE THAT'S BY TWENTY THIRTY TO. CALIFORNIA WAS ALSO THE NATIONAL LEADER IN THE INSTALLATION OF BATTERY STORAGE LAST YEAR OVER TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW BATTERY STORAGE INSTALLED IN CASE THE TERRITORY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE BY THE END OF THIS SUMMER- AND THIS IS FROM NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO SO COULD HAVE BEEN INCREMENTAL- INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DEPLOYMENT OF STORAGE OVER THE LAST TWO AND HALF. YEARS WELL THE PROGRESS TOWARD CLEAN ENERGY HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE FUND. TICKER LIABILITY HAS COME TO PORTLAND. I THINK THE OTHER JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY MORE EXTREME HEAT DROUGHT AND WILDFIRES AT THE SAME TIME WE BEGIN TRANSITIONING AWAY. FROM THE AGING WANTS TO CLEAN UNITS AND BRINGING UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES. INSURANCE LIABILITY HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING IS EXPECTED TO BE SELF. IN ADDITION WHILE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON AUTHORIZING CLEAN ENERGY PROCUREMENT. THE CHALLENGES ARE CURRENTLY WITH IT SO IF YOU DEPLOYMENT OF THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES INCLUDE APPLY CHANGE PERMITTING AND INTERCONNECTION DELAYS TO NAME A FEW. THE SHEER SCALE OF DEPLOYMENT- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE MOVED TO ADDRESS THE ONE HUNDRED TARGETS- THE 100% RETAIL SALES APPLIED BY THE NEW POLITICAL RESOURCES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THERE ARE A FEW CRITICAL TEAMS THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS. ALL THE AGENCIES COORDINATED KERR AT CPUC CC ALONG WITH- COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION HI SO AS WELL AS OTHER BALANCING AUTHORITIES AND- IN THE STATE AND THOSE ARE. THE SCALE OF THE RESOURCE BUILD AND DEPLETED WHICH WE MUST EQUALITY SOCIAL A CRITICAL THING TO PAY ATTENTION TO. ALONG WITH THAT IS AFFORDABILITY RELIABILITY. AND ENSURING AN EQUITABLE TRANSITION. ONE OF THE CRITICAL TO CONTINUE TO BE ITEM WILL CONDUCT THE NEXT STUDY. HAVE A ACTS TO THE CARD. FORM AND DISPATCH RESOURCES. WE'RE ALREADY WORKING ON DEPLOYING BATTERY STORAGE- WHICH IDEALLY FITS THE BILL I'VE BEEN MENTIONED WE HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF STORAGE DEPLOYMENT THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY. THE CBSE SPECIFICALLY ORDERED- ONE GIGAWATT OF LONG DURATION STORAGE AND ONE GIGAWATT OF. ZERO CARBON FORM RESOURCE BOOKLET JIM CARMEL TO COME ONLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX. EVEN WHILE DEPLOYING ON THE SCALE OF EIGHT GIGAWATT THAT YEAR TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE. GIVEN THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE AND STATE OF TECHNOLOGIES ALL OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY INDICATED THAT THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OPTIONS. TO MAINTAIN THE LIABILITIES TO RETAIN OPTIONALITY ALL TOOLS AVAILABLE INCLUDING PROMOTED PASSED THE- ALL. OUR ECONOMY LIKE DECARBONISATION REQUIRED LIKE ELECTRIFICATION AND USE THIS MEETING TO INCREASE CAPACITY NEEDS BUT IF AN OBVIOUS AGAINST THE OTHER TO COMMAND COULD NEARLY DOUBLE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES SO- IN NDT CAPTAIN FUTURE DEMAND I'M JUST ON HOW MUCH ARE WE GOING TO SEE WHEN. AND WHERE ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE OTHER CONDITIONS. WELL WE BELIEVE POWER PLANTS WITH CRITICAL GRANTING ABOUT THE EUCLID. OF THOSE PLANS WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT TIME THE COMBUSTION OF THE PART OF THE ENERGY MAKES IT IMPORTANT TO ME TO GET THE EMISSIONS FROM THOSE DOUBLE CLICKED. I WANT TO TOUCH ON EQUITY BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE PRINCIPAL. FOCUS FOR ALL THE AGENCIES. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE HOLDING WORKSHOPS WITH DJ COMMUNITIES- WE ARE HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR. NON ENERGY BENEFITS IN A MODELING. AND CC IN THE- INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY RECORD WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THE FEAR. I WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THE NEXT. DAY HE WANTED REPORT. WHAT IT ON TO VIRGINIA I JUST WANT. MENTION THERE ARE- AGENCIES ARE WORKING ON ENSURING THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. AS WELL AS THINKING THROUGH THESE VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR- DECARBONISING THE ENERGY SECTOR. AND THOSE INCLUDE OBVIOUSLY THE CARD SCOPING PLAN- AND THEN WORKING ON IT THIS YEAR I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT INFORMATION PUBLIC. I AGREE PROCESS AS WELL AS THE SB ONE HUNDRED IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE AGENCIES ARE DOING ALONG WITH THE NEXT AT A PORT. IN CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION OF HIGH SO IT BALANCES MCCARTY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT'S A PATH DOWN TO VIRGINIA FOR OPENING COMMENTS AND WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS MISS LOU WELCOME TO OF. THE SENATE. SUBCOMMITTEE TO ON RESOURCES. YEAH GOOD MORNING SENATOR. OF MY NAME IS RICHIE LOU AND I WILL AN- OF THE COMMISSION CARBON CAPTURE ACTIVITIES. AND PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE STATE OF THE CURRENT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AS PART OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION EFFORTS WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROFIT THE MISSION. PROCESS HE ACCOUNTED 485% OF THE BOTTLE GAS USE. ACTIVITIES THE FOCUS ON INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO REDUCE GASOLINE BUDGET INCREASE COOPER OFFICIAL CREE AND WITH PEOPLE COUNTRY. WE ARE STARTING TO LAUNCH AREN'T THE ACTIVITY IN THE CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION. OFFICIALLY FOR HARD TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES. WE HAVE PLANNED RESEARCH THROUGH OUR ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE PROGRAM IN OUR GAS R. AND B. PROGRAM THAT WILL FOCUS ON ADVANCING DEMONSTRATING AND TESTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE. THE ENERGY AND COST OF CARBON CAPTURE. INDUSTRIAL PLANTS. WELL WE ARE ALSO ON GETTING INTO DEL TECH. THAT CAN BE THE KEY CARD DIOXIDE TO MAKE VALUABLE COMMODITIES AND CRUDE THE ECONOMICS OF CARBON CAPTURE ACTIVITY IN THE FUTURE. INCLUDES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWENTY TWO- TWENTY THREE BUDGET AND AS MR BROWN MENTION IT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION AND ONE OF THE POTENTIAL TECHNOLOGY AREAS COULD BE CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION. AND THEN IN ADDITION- THERE'S ALSO POTENTIAL WITH THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT JOBS ACT. MORE THAN EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW CARPETING MANAGEMENT FUNDING IN OUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO BRING AS MUCH OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY TO CALIFORNIA POSSIBLE BY USING OUR RESEARCH GRANTS PROVIDE KOSHER FUNDING. APPLICANTS WITH PROJECTS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM GOAL. AS FAR AS CURRENCY TO BE IN. THERE ARE OVER TWO LARGE MOBILE PROJECT. IN OPERATIONS IN THE WORLD. BUT THERE ARE NO LARGE SCALE CARBON REMOVAL PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA- THREE PROJECTS ARE AWAITING APPROVAL OF THEIR STORAGE WELCOME THIS WITH THE US THEN THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF SMALL SCALE PROJECTS MOSTLY FUNDED BY DOE RICHARD CRIME WORK IN THE PHARMACY AND THE LAWS MCDONALD'S ENERGY CENTER IN PITTSBURGH. CALIFORNIA'S LAW HOME SEVERAL CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION START UPS THAT HAVE RECEIVED CRIED INDENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING WHICH IS YOUR LOAN TWELVE CARBON BUILD CARBON CAPTURE. THERE IS INTEREST ALSO INFORMING CARBON CAPTURE EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH CENTERS. COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS ON CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE DEMONSTRATION. LAST WEEK KRUESI CARBON CAPTURE SEQUESTRATION ECONOMIC ENTERED THE CHURCH FROM THE STATE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD- IMPLEMENTED BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE FEDERAL FORTY FIVE Q. CARBON CREDITS ARE NEEDED. THAT CONCLUDES MY- OPENING COMMENTS HERE COULD YOU TOUCH FOR A MINUTE ON THE BENEFITS OR THE OR THE CHALLENGES WITH ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY FOR WHAT FROM CARBON CAPTURE IT SEVEN IT SAID- WELL USE TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT YES IT IS THE WILL USE TECHNOLOGY AND- IT IT ALLOWS SEQUESTRATION OF THE CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE USE OF PUBLIC MORE OIL- OUT OF GAS WELL THAT WILL BE USED BUT YOU KNOW IT. WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AND TO. MINIMIZE OF FOSSIL FUEL USAGE IN THE FUTURE SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY WILL USE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT RIGHT NOW IS NOT ALIGNED WITH OUR OUR PROGRAM GOALS AND BEATING YOU KNOW CARDINALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND- YOU KNOW ALSO- YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING. TO MINIMIZE- YOU KNOW SCRIPT STRANDED ASSETS IN THE FUTURE AS WELL. I THINK AS FAR AS THE STATED TECHNOLOGY I KNOW- OUR STAFF REPORT TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW NOTHING REALLY HAPPENING- SINCE TWENTY TEN- DO YOU KNOW OF HOW THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED I KNOW THERE'S A CHALLENGE A CONCERNED ABOUT EMISSIONS THAT MAY OCCUR WHAT THE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WORSE IS STATED THAT TECHNOLOGY IN TWENTY TWENTY TO FROM. THAT AT ENERGY COMMISSION IS PERSPECTIVE. I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE ARE- PROJECTS BETTER BEEN FUNDED BY DEAL WE- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT FOCUS ON- ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY. UNITS WHICH IS THE BOX THAT WILL PROBABLY END. BUT YOU KNOW AND YOU IN CALIFORNIA SINCE YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TO- YOU KNOW. DECARBONISE ARE THE TRILLION INDUSTRY IT'S NOT IN AN AREA OF FOCUS HERE RIGHT. AND I THINK YOU KNOW IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY IMPACT WELL TO. AND AS THE VICE CHAIR- MENTIONED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AREAS IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE LISTEN TO OUR- UNITY- IN MANY- NO MORE PROJECTS OR LOOK IN LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES AND- PENSION WAITING THEY'LL CONTINUE TO USE. OF COLIN AND THERE IS COULD CAUSE- YOU KNOW IN OUR MIDDLE. IF AND HEART TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. YES MEAN I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE TARGET AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS OUR STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT IS THE PERMIT PERMITTING THAT TAKES FIVE TO SIX YEARS SO WE'LL GET TO THAT. BUT CONCEIVABLY- IF YOU IF THERE WAS ENHANCE OIL RECOVERY AND THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE CARPET IN THOSE AEAS THAT WERE. THAT WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED THEY CAN OPERATE FOR. TWENTY YEARS AND PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY I GET THE CRITICISM THAT LOOK MIGHT PROLONG. THE ASSETS OF THE OF THE- REFINERY ORDER I MEAN OF EXTRACTION BUT FROM A SCIENCE POINT OF VIEW YOU DON'T DISPUTE THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS CARBON THAT WILL BE MADE AT. FROM THOSE FACILITIES RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S NOT. WE AGREE ON THAT RIGHT. WELL I MEAN I THINK IF YOU REQUESTED THE CARBON- THEN THERE WOULD BE- YOU KNOW LET THE- TO BEING PUT OUT INTO THE- THE ATMOSPHERE BUT I THINK HE REALLY. NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL YOU KNOW IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL YOU KNOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL TO. SURE OKAY SO LET'S THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COME UP WITH A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD. ELIMINATE OR TAKE OUT THE IDEA OF A SEQUESTERING THE CARBON IN A IN A GEOLOGICAL STORAGE CAN YOU HIGHLIGHT TEST THE AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL OR BIO GAS OR ANY OTHER ANY OTHER APPLICATION EVEN WHEN IT WAS. S. C. LIVERMORE LAB REPORT POINTS OUT CONVENIENTLY LOCATED RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE THE FACILITY YES CAN YOU EXPLAIN OR AT EDUCATE ME ON THAT. WELL I THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON UTILIZATION. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU MENTIONED- IS THE LONG PERMITTING HI TO GET THESE PROJECTS- SIDE. AND SO ARE FUNDING HAS A LIMITED- ENCUMBRANCES LIQUIDATION DATE. AND NO WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE STARTING A PROJECT AND NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT PROJECT WITHIN OUR- LIQUIDATION PERIOD. AND SO- YOU KNOW IT IS THE PROJECT OF THE PERMITTING PROCESS TAKES FIVE TO TEN YEARS. THERE ARE FUNDS LIQUIDATE AND YOU KNOW FIGURE FOR WE NEVER GET TO THAT SECOND POINT AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY YOU KNOW WE WERE FOCUSING ON UTILIZATION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE ENDPOINT OF THE LOCK CULTURALLY BE ABLE CAN'T CONSULT. WITH THE TIME FRAME THAT ARE FUNDING YEAH YEAH IT'S SOME IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S PRETTY PROUD OF THAT IT TAKES FIVE TO SIX YEARS SAID TO- SITE ANYTHING AND WE'VE GOT AN ALPHABET SOUP OF. OF PEOPLE THAT OUR AGENCIES THAT HAVE JURISDICTION I MEAN IT'S OUR STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE STATE'S ENERGY POLICY AND PLANNING. INCLUDING CITING OF LARGE THERMAL POWER PLANTS THIRTY THESE POWER PLANTS ARE ANY THERMAL ELECTRICAL GENERATING FACILITY WITH A CAPACITY OF FIFTY MEGAWATTS OR MORE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE A- A THERMAL POWER PLANT THAT'S NOT FIFTY MEGAWATTS WHAT IS IT WHAT IS. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S. JURISDICTION THERE FIFTY MEGAWATTS ENERGY DOESN'T HAVE JURISDICTION. AND ERIC GREITENS ALSO THE LINE FROM OUR CITING CONDITIONS THAT SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT OR ABOUT. THE UPSIDE IN CONDITION ACTIVITY ON FIGHTING PLANTS MISTER KNIGHT GOOD GOOD MORNING WHY DON'T YOU WANT HELP US OUT. GOOD MORNING SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU- YES EVERYTHING IS CORRECT SO- THAT THERMAL POWER PLANT FIFTY MEGAWATTS AND- LYFT LESSON FIFTY MEGABYTES WOULD BE NOT WITHIN THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S JURISDICTION- THE- SAKE IT'S PERMITS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THERE DISTRICTS UNDER ITS OTHER AGENCIES. OF THE WORLD POWER PLANTS FIFTY MEGAWATTS AND LARGER FOLLOW THE- ENERGY COMMISSION EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION SO A PERMIT FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS IN LIEU OF- THE AT ANY OTHER PERMIT THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REQUIRED BY. LOCAL OR STATE AGENCY- IT SOFTENS REFERRED TO AS A ONE STOP SHOP- PERMITTING PROCESS IT'S SET IN STATUTE THAT TWELVE MONTHS- AND SO AT THE END OF THE- PRECEDING. AS CERTIFICATE IS GREAT THE HAS THE PER SYDNEY TO- AND THE- THAT THAT PROCESS OFTENTIMES TAKES- CONSIDERING LONGER THAN TWELVE MONTHS- THERE IS OFTEN TIMES- PROJECT CHANGES. TO THE FACILITY TO- AVOID ENVIRONMENTAL HARM ADDRESS COMMUNITY CONCERNS AND SO THERE IS KIND OF A KIND OF RESTARTING THE CLOCK. AS IT NOW I'M SOMEWHAT FOR ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY BY THE STAFF TO UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW THE CHANGE THE PROJECT IN ITS TOMORROW CONSEQUENCES SELF- FOR- THERE. THERE HAS BEEN- THERE'S THE VIRGINIA OF REFERENCE THE LOS SURPRISE- THAT'S AN EXIST- POWER PLANT THAT WAS LICENSED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE- THAT IS OWNED BY CALPINE CORPORATION. THEY FILED TO POST CERT PETITIONS- THE WITH THE ENERGY SET TO ADD DEMONSTRATION TO CARBON CAPTURE- AND STORAGE ONE OF THOSE HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION- IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. THE OTHER ONE IS STILL MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE- THE PROCESS- IT- THEN WE'RE WAITING ON INFORMATION FROM THEIR DISTRICT ON THE HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS ON. YOU ALSO THAT ENERGY COMMISSION ALSO HAS JURISDICTION ON CITING BIOMASS FACILITIES AND NATURAL GAS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S CORRECT. K. ANY POWER PLANT USES ABOUT SOME FORM OF HEAT- THE GENERATOR ELECTRICITY- THERMAL AND ELECTRIC GENERATION FACILITY- FIFTY MEG WATCHING GREATER FALLS IN THE MAN'S QUESTIONS OF OUR EXCEL SOLAR THERMAL GEOTHERMAL BIOMASS. NATURAL GAS YES. SO OF- THAT THAT WE LIKE TO REVISIT OFTEN WHEN WE HAVE HEARINGS HERE ON- IN STEP TWO ANDWE HAVE A LOT OF BIOMASS THAT'S NOW USED IN AGRICULTURE THAT'S BEING BURNED WE NOW KNOW WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO LIMIT THAT. WE HAVE A BOATLOAD OF BIOMASS THAT SITTING IN OUR FORESTS. THAT HAS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE FORCE IS PART OF YOU KNOW OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO. YOU KNOW EITHER MAKE FUEL WITH IT OR SHIP IT OR MAKE pOPTIONS BUT BUT- CITING THE BIOMASS FACILITIES IS AN IMPORTANT. ELEMENT FOR US FIGHTING THIS OTHER CLIMATE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE OF THESE ENORMOUS FIRES THAT WE HAVE- SO WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON CITING BIOMASS IS IT THE SAME FIFTY. MEGAWATTS YEAH THE COMMISSION'S EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR ANY THURMOND OUR PLAN STARTS AT FIFTY MEGAWATTS OKAY NOW IS THERE ANYTHING MAGIC ABOUT FIFTY MEGABYTES IF WE IF WE CHANGE THAT TO A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE OR HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS ARE WE GOING TO TAKE THE ENERGY COMMISSION OUT YOU STILL HAVE THE LOCAL AIR BOARD AND- THIRD THE REGIONAL- THE FOLKS THERE WHAT BENEFIT WOULD THAT. IN YOUR MIND WITH THAT CREATE. IF YOU WERE TO RAISE THE LIMIT SO THAT THAT TWO HUNDRED I ALSO THAT WHILE THEY'RE THERE ALREADY IS AN EXAM THERE'S A SMALL POWER PLANT EXTENSION- WHICH IS- ANY POWER PLANT UP TO NOT EXCEEDING A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS- NOT EXCEEDING HUNDRED MEGAWATTS CAN APPLY FOR A SMALL POWER PLANT EXEMPTION AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN THAT CASE IT WOULD GET AS PERMITS FROM- THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT. THE ENERGY COMMISSION WOULD DO THE SEQUOIA- ANALYSIS CALIFORNIA POLY ACT ANALYSIS- AND THEN IT IF IT WERE EXEMPTED- THE FINE IS GOING TO MANDATE WOULD BE HANDED BACK TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR PERMITTING. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES IT ANY QUICKER- BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE TO GO GET THEIR PERMITS FROM ANY OTHER AGENCIES AS THEY STUCK WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE ENERGY COMMISSION CERTIFICATE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN LIEU OF THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THAT. SO MAY YOU CAN HELP ME ON THAT THIS SITE. SET SO LET'S SEE YOU HAVE A HIGH MEGAWATTS. BIOMASS AND IT IS LOCATED NEXT DOOR TO A GEOLOGICAL. GOD CAVITY OR STORAGE FACILITY THAT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD AGREES IS AYE DELEK FOR STORING CARBON. AND UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT SAYS WE CAN'T DO THAT THAT THAT'S NOT AN ELIGIBLE SO THAT MEANS THAT THAT AND LET'S SEE THE OPERATOR WANTS TO DO IT THEY WANT TO PUT IN THEIR OWN MONEY THEY WANT TO. TAKE SOME OF THE FEDERAL MONEY. WHY IS THAT A BAD IDEA. WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE POLICY REASON FROM THE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ME TO ANSWER- I DON'T KNOW OF ANYBODY ELSE THE COMMISSION. FOR THE REST OF US THAT'S REALLY OUTSIDE MY AREA OF EXPERTISE OKAY THANK IS BECAUSE YOUR SITE YOUR THE SITE THIS IS WHERE IT CITED RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WANTED TO. YEAH I WOULD JUST I WOULD GUESS A FROM A CITING PERSPECTIVE I MEAN FROM A LICENSING PERSPECTIVE IT'S INFOPRINT EVAN APPLICANT PROPOSED SUCH A- A PROJECT WITH CARBON CAPTURE IS A PART OF THE PROJECT IT WOULD LIKELY BE- WHAT'S CALLED A RELATED DISABILITY AND FALL INTO THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AUTHORITY. TO PERMIT IT- IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING ES DE- AN ELEMENT OF THE PROJECT IS DEDICATED TO AN ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTION OF THE POWER PLANTS THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION THE SITE THE ENTIRETY OF THE FACILITY ALLENTOWN IS. SENATE ALL YOU RECOGNIZE THANK YOU FOR SHARING- SO. I GUESS HE WAS REGION IT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE- CAPTURE THE FACILITIES THEN AND WE BASICALLY OF EXCLUDED. OIL AND GAS FOR CAPTURE IS WHAT WHAT- I HEARD YOU SAY AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A GOAL OF THE- INSPIRATIONS I BELIEVE- SO I WANT TO JUST GIVE SENSE OF. ADDICTIVE THE FRUSTRATION FOR MOST OF. THE MEMBERS HERE IS THAT. THERE IS NO LONG TERM GOAL OF- BUT PUTS A LOT WHAT'S THE PLAN WHAT'S THE REAL PLAN HERE WE WERE FOCUSING ON. CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE AND IF WE CAN'T. THE CARBON IF WE CAN'T CAPTURE THE CARBON AND GENERATE ELECTRICITY AT THE SAME TIME- BUT MAKING THE ENVIRONMENT. OF BEING PROPER IN THAT IN THAT ONE LOCATION WHAT IS A LONG TERM GOAL I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE- PUT ANY GASOLINE IN YOUR CAR OR PAGE ELECTRIC BILL LATELY BUT IT'S- IS EXTREMELY HIGH IN CALIFORNIA. EXTREMELY HIGH. SIX FORTY FIVE A GALLON OF GAS THIS MORNING. AND ARE WE PAY 60% HIGHER ELECTRIC RATES. THAN THE AVERAGE IN THE NATON. AND CALIFORNIANS ARE LEADING THE LEAGUE IN THE STATE. AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LEADING IN THE AREA OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND- I'M NOT SURE WE'RE REALLY DOING THAT I THINK WE'RE JUST pI GUESS THAT REDUCES YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IF THEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN FOR NOT GOING TO FOCUS ON CAPTURING CARBON IN A SAFE MANNER IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE PLANTS ARE SITED- INTRODUCE- YOU KNOW OIL AND GAS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE USING THAT IN THE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS BEFORE WE GET TO. A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE ELECT EVEY CARS ARE- INTERGRADES MARKETS ALREADY SHE WITH THAT WAS ARTICLE YESTERDAY THEY CAME OUT THEY SAID WE COULD HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER. NOW IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE ROLLING BLACKOUTS THIS SUMMER MAY WE OUGHT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN AVOID THAT SO CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT IN THE DARK. SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN. YOU'RE JUST FOCUSING ON GASOLINE IN YOUR FOCUS ON NOT ALLOWING US TO CAPTURE CAPTURE CARBON. AT THE SITE. WERE PRODUCING ELECTRICITY. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AND- I JUST WANTED A BIGGER- DISCUSSION ON THIS ONE AND PASS IT TO MY COLLEAGUES TO GET ONE I NEED ANYMORE INFORMATION. I JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL I THINK THE POINT YOU JUST. MADE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU AS YOU MENTIONED AT A LIABILITY THAT IMPORTANT FOCUS AND I THINK YOU JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE COMMITMENTS EACH AND THAT AS WE LOOK THROUGH THE ENERGY TRANSITION. AND MOVING FORWARD OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE THE COOKING NICE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE AND AS WE- INDICATED EARLIER. AND WE SEE THAT LITTLE DOG TURMEL- GENERATION IS THE CHOIR BASED ON THE CURRENT MODELING TODAY AND THE STATE OF TECHNOLOGY FROM THE COST. AS LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT THERMAL ENERGY FOR OUR PERSONAL. GENERATIONS WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM YES. I THINK THAT THE EXACT- THAT KIND OF POINT OF SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS WHICH WE ARE STILL THINKING THROUGH IS TO THE EXTENT THAT CCS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION. WHERE AND HOW WE CITED AND IT'S- IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TACKLING- IN OUR HYPER THIS YAR WITH BEGINNING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT I THINK AND THE PRINCIPLE LEVELS- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT OPTIONS THAT IMPORTANT. AS. WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION. SO- A UP QUESTION THAT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. CARBON IN THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THE EMISSIONS OF FORCE BY WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CAPTURE- WHEN IT'S ON FIRE BUT WE CAN CAPTURE IT- JUST AS THE CHAIRMAN- TALKED ABOUT IN BIOMASS BEFORE- IT GOES UP IN IN FLAMES AND IT'S ACTUALLY WHILE PART IN IN LAST YEAR. THE DIXIE FIRE WHICH WAS ALL IN MY DISTRICT. AND ALSO THE CALDOR BAR WHICH WAS ALL IN MY DISTRICT- DESTROYED ALMOST A MILLION ACRES ONE FIRE. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OUTPUT OF CARBON FOR CALIFORNIANS WHICH- WE NEED TO COUNT WE DON'T COUNT THAT AS OUR AS OUR EMISSIONS EVEN THOUGH WE COULD. CAPTURE THAT CARBON CREATE GREEN ENERGY AND PUT IT IN A BIOMASS PLANT INSIDE AND THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR IS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE AND THE TRINITY'S WE'RE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT IS THAT- TO ALLEVIATE THOSE EMISSIONS PRIOR TO A CATASTROPHIC FIRE SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THAT. YEAH- SO TO THE EXTENT THE SB ONE HUNDRED MODELING AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE IT. AGAIN JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL FIRST AND THEN TRY TO SEE IF WE COULD. ADD ANY MORE DETAILS. SO WHEN WE STARTED DOING THAT AT THE ONE HUNDRED AND OUT OF SAYS. SB ONE ANALYSIS I DO THINK ABOUT THE- ENERGY TRANSITION. EVERYTHING THAT IS ELIGIBLE IN THE R. P. S. IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE. ALONG WITH. ON SITE RESOURCES ARE DUE TO CARMEN SO BETWEEN THAT CONTEXT- WE DID MODEL AND IN THE BYE BY MASS. AND BY BUDGET. IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR PS AND IT'S STILL. A PART OF OUR MODELING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD THE CHAIR I MENTION THIS THIS COMMON I THINK THERE ARE A BAD IDEA A PRICE HAVE PULLING TOGETHER. IN TERMS OF BOTH THE CLIMATE CHALLENGES. BUT A LIABILITY THE AFFORDABILITY- AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY DECARBONISATION CLIMATE GOALS AND I THINK AS WE LOOK THROUGH THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ABOUT IDEA SCENARIOS. AND ARRIVING AT SOLUTIONS THAT- THAT KIND OF CONNECT THE DOTS ON WE JUST ABOUT IT BEING MENTIONED TODAY AND EXPECT. TO ADDRESS MOST OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED TODAY. TRY LAST. DOES THAT THE COMMISSION OR THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOK INTO THE FOR THAT. WE IMPORT ENERGY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. SUCH AS ECUADOR WHERE WE'RE BRINGING IN 24% OF OUR CRUDE OIL RIGHT NOW FROM ECUADOR WHICH HAS NO REGULATIONS AND IS DESTROYING THE AMAZON RAINFOREST AT THE SAME TIME PUTTING. OIL IN A SHIP AND IN. BRINGING HERE WHICH IS IT ADMISSION. WORKING IN OUR PORTS WHICH IS A MISSION FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO LIVE IN IN SAN DIEGO AREA FOR SURE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- WHAT IS THE PLAN TO LIKE. REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT AT THE OVERALL CARBON OUTPUT. WHEN WE IMPORT VERSUS WHETHER PRODUCING THOSE- THAT ENERGY FOR CALIFORNIANS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR NIGHT AND WHEN IT CAME TO GET MY IS THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU YOU MADE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POINT THAT THIS HAS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE- DECARBONISING LOOK AT AN ECONOMY LEVEL AND IN A CARD HAS BEEN WORKING ON THAT LATE FEES AND SCOPING PLAN. AND HAD BEEN WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH A BUNCH OF STATE AGENCIES THAT WILL BETTER EXPANDABLE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE AS WELL AS THE ENERGY SIDE AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO. ABOUT I WILL A BLUEPRINT. COMING TOGETHER THROUGH THIS BEING PLANNED. AND THEN WE LOOK FOR TO. HAVING THOSE. AT SOON AND THEN HAVING FOR THE DISCUSS. WHAT WHEN WILL THAT BE AVAILABLE. I'VE BEEN WAITING TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN WAITING TEN YEARS FOR A PLANT. TEN YEARS WHERE MY OR LONGER. WHEN WITHOUT AND WHEN WILL THERE BE A PLAN AVAILABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT THE OF THE LONG TERM EFFECTS AND THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF IMPORTING VERSES CREATING- OUR ENERGY HERE AT HOME. IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE FIRST ON THAT- HIGH LEVEL AND ISSUE OF THE CARDS REPORT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT WITHIN THIS MONTH AS PART OF THE UNDERSTAND. I'M AS FAR AS THEIR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE GLOBAL IMPORTANCE SUCH. YOU KNOW WE WILL CIRCLE BACK. WITH THE CARD THAT'S THE ONE THEY HAVE AND WE WILL AND IT COME BACK TO YOU WITH MORE THAN SIX SO I HAVE ONE SO WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION NOT PERMITTING WELLS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THERE'S A THOUSAND WELLS AT CAL JIM. AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING PERMITTED AND WE'RE IMPORTING OIL FROM. WE WORK FROM RUSSIA. WE WERE WE ARE FROM ECUADOR WHY WOULD WE NOT MAKE CALIFORNIA IN IT WHERE WE DO IT CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT AND WE PUT CALIFORNIA PEOPLE TO WORK ON OF COMMODITY THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO USE WE USE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY. I LOOK I'M FORGETTING IS TO ELECT DOCTORATE EV'S BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THEIR PERCENT ANYTIME SOON BECAUSE OUR GRIT IS NOT EVEN AND SHAPE. TO PUT OUT THE ELECTRICITY THAT WE NEED SO. SO WHAT WHERE IS IT WHERE IS THAT. KNOWLEDGE IS. WHAT ARE WE NOT WHY ARE WE NOT PRODUCING OIL IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S MY QUESTION AND WHY ARE WE DESTROYING THE RAINFOREST. ANTS IN DOING A VICTORY LAP IN CALIFORNIA SAYING WE'RE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE NOT. I THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTOOD. SOMETHING THAT AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. DOESN'T DIRECTLY WORK IN- YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO COORDINATING IT SPONSORS TO YOU ABOUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING. THAT FIFTY. PEOPLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON. WHAT WE COULD CAPTURE THIS IS ABOUT CARBON CAPTURE WE COULD BE CAPTURING OIL. ARE WE COULD BE CATCHING CARBON AT OIL WELLS AND PRODUCING WELL CALIFORNIA CLEAN IN A CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT MANNER THAT'S THE QUESTION. WHY WHY. I BELIEVE IT THERE IS A RHETORICAL QUESTION- I'VE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS BECAUSE WE DID HEAR TESTIMONY THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO OPERATIONAL- CCS PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND THAT FOR- THEY ENERGY COMMISSION HOW MANY FACILITIES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S SEQUENCE CERTIFIED PERMITTING PROCESS. AND HAVE YOU NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS- THERE ARE PRESENTLY THERE'S SEVENTY SIX- POWER PLANTS THAT ARE OPERATE IN AND CALIFORNIA DATE EVER LICENSE BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION. ONE ONE FACILITY LOOKS MADONNA'S ENERGY CENTER- WHICH IS OWNED BY COMPANY CORPORATION HAS FILED- POST CERT PETITIONS ON OUR REGULATIONS TO- DEMONSTRATE CARBON CAPTURE. AND STORAGE AND TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF. PROJECTS ONE WAS APPROVED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THAT SOUND. TO SEND- PROBABLY 1% OF THE FLUE GAS FROM THE LOOKS WITH US AND ENERGY CENTER ACROSS THE STREET- ACROSS THIRD STREET IN PITTSBURGH CALIFORNIA TO SAN FRANCISCO BAY AGGREGATES- WILL PLANET- FOR PRODUCING- ROCK YES IN IRAQ PRODUCTS RIGHT AND THEN- SUPPOSED SECOND PROJECT THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AYE AND CLEAN ENERGY OF BLAMES THE NAME- IT WOULD BE ON SITE THERE ARE MULTIPLE DONNA'S ENERGY CENTER IT'S- PRESENTLY MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S- PROCESS AND RECORDING WITH LOOK WHAT THE BAY AREA A KID ON THE- ON THE PERMITTING FOR THE- FOR THE ACTIVITIES. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THIS WHAT POINT SOURCES IN THE ENERGY SECTOR OF THE GREATEST GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS AND IS IT CURRENTLY COST EFFECTIVE- FOR THESE FACILITIES TO ADAPT AT CCS. RIGHT IS IT. YEP THE BIGGEST CENTIMETERS. THAT WE HAVE OUR- GENERALLY IN THE OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. REFINING FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC GENERATION BUSINESS MANUFACTURING- NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION AND OPTIONAL COMBINING. AND THE COST OF CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES- RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY DOLLARS A METRIC TON DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FACILITY YOU KNOW SOME FACILITIES HAVE RELATIVELY- NOT CONTAMINATED FIELDS WHO LIKE A SMALL PRODUCTION SO THOSE WOULD BE EASIER TO CAPTURE THE FEEL TO THAN OTHERS THAT HAVE OTHER CONTAMINANTS. AND SO MANY OF THE CCS- ARE PLANNED IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING- STUDIES AT THIS POINT TO ANALYZE. YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS GO GET JONES STUDIES AND FINANCIAL DECISIONS SOME OF THEM HAVE HAD AN INITIAL STUDY AND THEN THEY'RE DOING ADDITIONAL FLOODING. YOUR BID FOR THE MAKE THEIR- DECISION. AND SO I'M LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY WHERE THERE'S A FREEZING STREAM. THE FEDERAL CHIU FORTY FIVE INCENTIVE PAYMENT. RIGHT I GUESS I GUESS I THINK RIGHT NOW I'M YEAH NO GO AHEAD I JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TO MAXIMIZE CARBON CAPTURE IN THE COUNTRY IS IT NECESSARY THAT. WE FACILITATE THE ADOPTION AT THESE LARGE POLLUTERS OR ARE THE SMALL POINT- SOURCES OF VIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE TARGET FOR CAPTURE. WELL I THINK IT'S CAN ON THE LOCATION OF THE- AND THE DISTANCE TO THE WORKSITE- AND THE- OVERALL POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAPPEN ENVIRONMENT BOTH. SHE I THINK LOCAL COMMUNITY YOU KNOW NEED TO. GREAT DAY ARE ALSO VERY CHEAP IN TO TURN THAT THE OF THE- THESE SYSTEM. OKAY ONE LAST QUESTION AND THIS IS I MAY ASK THE ALEJO THE STANFORD ENERGY FUTURES INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY IN THAILAND ACTION PLAN FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITIES CHALLENGES THE SOLUTIONS REPORT STATES THAT CCS IS CURRENTLY NOT INELIGIBLE PATHWAY UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE MANDATORY GREEN GAS REPORTING REGULATIONS AS A RESULT COVERED ENTITIES CANNOT UCCS TO REDUCE THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT'S THE YEAR THEIR ANNUAL EMISSIONS CAP. EVEN IF THEY CAPTURE AND STORE THEIR EMISSIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CCS PROTOCOL SO IS THAT MISTER BROWN IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING- OF A OF THAT AND HAVE YOU. IS THAT YOUR OF THAT BIG CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IN CCS. YES THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING AND I GUESS- SOME HAS FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAVE YOU'VE NOTED THISBEING A BARRIER TO THE ADOPTION THE CCS AT THERMAL POP UP POWER PLANTS I MEAN IF THEY'RE NOT COVERED UNDER. A I COULD GET A REDUCTION IS THAT A BARRIER ON THE FOR THEM. BUT WHAT YOU KNOW WE ARE BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CAN YOU COME BACK. YEAH WELL ALIGHT I THINK- MAYBE ERIC ALSO HELP ON THIS I THINK IS ERICA. THAT YOU KNOW THE CDC HAS JURISDICTION ON OUR POWER PLANTS OVER FIFTY MEGAWATT. AND IF THAT PROJECT CAME IN AND HAD A CCS COMPONENTS WITH THAT. THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION- TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL- BUT AT THIS POINT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE HAD BEEN ANY- PEARL HARBOR SENT OVER FIFTY MEGAWATTS THAT HAVE COME IN BUT- PCS. IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. I MEAN YOU COULD YOU COULD SEE THE THREE MEN THERE GOING TO GET ANY CREDIT FOR THAT AND TRADE. AND THEY STILL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE Q. PROGRAM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS WITH FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S OUT THERE OR PERHAPS- ADVANCES THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOUSE. AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT FOR THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD BE A GOOD DEAL LESS CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT THESE POWER PLANTS THESE IN THESE MATTERS. SO I'D LIKE FOR YOU GUYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- THIS IS AN INFORMATION HEARING SO I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S UP EVERYBODY'S- PARTICIPATION. WE HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FROM CENTER DOLLY WHY DOES IT TAKE TEN YEARS TO PERMIT WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE BOTTLENECK OR WHAT WHAT THAT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LONG TIME TO. DO THE RIGHT THING. I THINK THAT- THERE'S ALSO DISCOUNTS DEPARTMENT QUALITY ACT AS WELL AS LOCAL PERMITTING. AND- ANNABEL YOU OFFICES MY IMPRESSION IS THAT- YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THE PERMITTING THERE'S MULTIPLE WHICH ALSO GETTING THE WELL PERMITS FROM THE EPA ON JAN YOU KNOW THERE'S NO AGENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND SHOW GOING THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS- TAKES TIME NO I THINK ERIC TALKED ABOUT THE CITING PROCESS AND YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE PROJECTS THAT ARE LESS THAN FIFTY MEGAWATTS VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE OLDER FIFTY MEGAWATTS AND- YOU KNOW WHEN AND IF HE HAS TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES TO GET APPROVAL. EACH ONE OF THOSE COULD PAINT- HELLO THIS IS ACTUALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BY CAPTURING CARBON. AND SEQUESTERING IT THERE WOULD BE. VERY LITTLE IMPACT. BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF DECARBONISATION. GOALS SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT WOULD TAKE TEN YEARS. IF IT IF THERE IS NO NEGATIVE IMPACT IS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE TO GETTING TO OUR- CLIMATE GOALS. M. ANIMAL I BELIEVE IT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENERGY COMMISSION AND ALEJO FOR HELPING US ON- ISSUE NUMBER ONE FAN THIS IS NO ACTION NEEDS TO BE- TAKEN THIS INFORMATION. ITEM LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE SENATE OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE BUDGET PLAN EIGHT TEAM POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DROUGHT AND WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY WILDFIRE RESILIENCY LEVEL RISE AND EXTREME HEAT MISTER BROWN WELCOME BACK. I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY BE ON THE RETAILER'S FROM. SO NICE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AND I UNDERSTAND THIS KIRSTEN'S ON ALSO. THAT'S RIGHT WE GOT THE WHOLE TEAM HERE READY FOR YOU- HOPEFULLY TO HELP YOU ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS SO STAFF HAS ASKED US TO HELP PRESENT- THE SENATE DEMOCRATS AS CLIMATE BUDGET PLAN- JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES THIS WE ARE HAPPY TO PRESENT IS YOUR STAFF BUT THIS IS NOT IN LA- DEVELOPED. RECOMMENDED OR ENDORSED UP PLAN I'M JUST HERE TO HELP YOU- SO AS AS NOTE. THAT PLAN INCLUDES EIGHTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FIVE. AND HAS FIVE COMPONENTS WHICH I'LL WALK THROUGH BRIEFLY THEY'RE DESCRIBING YOUR AGENDA SO THE FIRST IS OUT FOR WATER IN DROUGHT ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS OVER THREE YEARS. ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THAT PIECE OUR TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO RE BALANCE STATE WATER SUPPLY AND WATER RIGHTS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE WATERSHED CLIMATE RESILIENCE REGIONALLY. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR A DROUGHT RESILIENT WATER SUPPLY GRANTS. AND ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND DAM SAFETY. THERE IS ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION IN DETAIL ON THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS IN YOUR AGENDA. NEXT COMPONENT IS FOR WILDFIRE. SO THE SENATE PACKAGE SENATE DEMOCRATS PACKAGE ME SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS OR ONE POINT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY I TO BUILD ON GOVERNOR'S WILD PROPOSALS COMPONENTS OF THAT INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR FUEL REDUCTION NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BIOMASS ACCUMULATION THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATE CONSERVANCY'S AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS I'M GOING TO EXPAND STAFFING RATIOS CHU THREE FOR CALIFORNIA FIRE ENGINES. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGES RELATED TO SEA LEVEL RISE THE PACKAGE INCLUDES THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SPREAD OVER MULTIPLE YEARS TO IMPROVE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE TO SEA LEVEL RISE. THAT INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO FUND SB ONE OR- AND MADAM TO MATCH AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS. THE FOURTH COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE IS SPECIFIC FOR CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ARE THAT INCLUDES A TOTAL OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS- SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THEN THE FIFTH COMPONENT OF THE PACKAGE IS RELATED TO BIODIVERSITY AND OUTDOOR ACCESS FOR ALL THAT WOULD BE ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS FOR NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS THOSE COMPONENTS INCLUDE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ACHIEVE THE THIRTY BY GOAL OR CONSERVING PERCENT OF STATE LAW AND CO WATERS BY THIRTY. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FOR URBAN GREEN AND URBAN FORESTRY. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUTDOOR ACCESS. AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EQUITY ACTS GRANT. IN ADDITION THE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU INCLUDES- OUR LANGUAGE AND AROUND THE CLIMATE EQUITY TRUST FUND THE PACKAGE WOULD ESTO A EQUITY TRUST FUND FOR THE BAY. OF THE CONSUMED CUSTOMERS AND TO AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. THE PACKAGE ALSO IS INTENDED TO ACHIEVE SB ONE HUNDRED AND FROM GOALS ARE SPECIFICALLY 90% OF ELECTRICITY SALES TO END USE CUSTOMERS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ZERO CARBON RESOURCES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND 95% BY TWENTY FORTY. AND THE PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES HIGH ROAD LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS- SO WITH THAT GIVEN THE SAYS NOT A PACKAGE WERE INVOLVED IN THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ONLY A PACKAGE WE CAN'T OFFER ANY. SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THOSE PROBABLY ARE BEST ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CHAIR ON BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY HIGH LEVEL QUESTIONS ARE BACKGROUND QUESTION I AM HERE AS OUR MY COLLEAGUES- MR BROWN AND MISS CHRISTINE CANCER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. EXCELLENT WHAT'S- TURN TO- MEMBERS MAY HAVE QUESTIONS SENATOR. CHOIR YOU RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR HONEST MAKES A VERY QUICK COMMENTS WILL BE TWO MINUTES OR LESS. NUMBER ONE I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR. THE CHAIR HAS. MANY OF OURS AND IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE WORKING ON THE PACKAGE. AND IT FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST ON THE- THAT WE HAPPENED CITY CALIFORNIA. FOCUS ON THE WORST DROUGHT AT STATE IS SEEN IN TWELFTH CENTURY MORE FIRE SAFE. THROUGH HISTORIC EVENT INVESTMENT. IN WILDFIRE- PREPARATION. PREVENTION IS WELLS FINALLY FIXING THE COW FIRE CHAU TWENTY THREE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE A THE SENATE. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THIS INVESTMENT IT ALSO MAKES HIS INVESTMENTS IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE THIS WOULD REPRESENT THE LARGEST INVESTMENT OF ANY STATE IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND THE LAST THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE IS TO TONI ATKINS THE LEADER OF THE SENATE BUT SHE HAS MADE CLIMATE THAT ONE OF THE SENATE'S TOP PRIORITIES SHE'S FALL THROUGH A STEP OF THE WAY AND THIS IS A GROUND. BUDGET INVESTMENT THAT WILL HELP SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE IN THE TACKLE SOME OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THANK YOU SO MUCH SECURE FREE WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU FOR THOSE KIND WORDS SENATE ALI YOU RECOGNIZE. WELL I SINCE THIS- WAS LAID OUT AS THE DEMOCRATS. THE PROPOSAL AND I AM THE ONLY REPUBLICANS SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS GOING TO. BY WATER RIGHTS AND RETIRED LANDING CALIFORNIA- WHAT WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE AN THIS IS THE IS SOME THAT RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA. HAVE BEEN ARE YOU OVER- WATER RIGHTS FOR A LONG TIME AND- AND I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY CAME FROM COMMUNITIES WHERE WE'VE LOST OUR WATER- LAST YEAR WE WORKED ON- THE TO THE LAKE BASIN WHERE. THEY THEY HAD A ZERO ALLOCATION OF WATER BUT NOT ONLY DOES IT IMPACT THE FARMER IN. THE FOOD SUPPLY FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION- BUT ALSOIMPACTS COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT YOU. NEVER RECOUP FROM COMMUNITY- YOU YOU LOSE. ALL THE SUPPLIERS OF THOSE FOLKS IN THE WORK FORCE FOR THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST OF MOST OF WHICH ARE JUST ADMIT PAGE MUSED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE. SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. WITH THE L. A. O. I'M JUST A MECHANICAL- A LEVEL ONE AT TARGET RESP OR I CAN RESPOND OBVIOUSLY ALSO. I CAN JUST NOTE SENATOR THAT THE STATE HAS HAD SOME EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS WHERE- THAT KIND OF PERCH WATER RIGHTS IT'S BEEN PRETTY LIMITED- THERE WAS SOME FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S BUT- AT TWO KIND OF BUILD ON A PROGRAM THAT THAT WHILE I'M- WELL IF. BOARD RUNS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS PURCHASING WATER SO AS IS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA- IT STATES THAT THIS WOULD BE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO PURCHASE WATER ALONG PRIORITIZE STREAM SEGMENTS AND OUTLINED SOME- PORTIONS OF THE STATE WHERE FUNDING WOULD BE DEDICATED FOR THIS- AS IT WOULD BE A ABOUT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. RIGHT AND I THINK THE- THIRTY WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RECONCILIATION TO OCCUR WITH THE AMOUNT OF RIGHTS THAT ARE HELD BY PEOPLE IN THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE THEORY IS THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO SELL THOSE RIGHTS NOT EVERYBODY BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE DONE DONE DONE THEY DALY THERE OKAY FOR A PRICE AND WE DON'T KNOW I DON'T I'M NOT SPECULATING WITH THE PRICES BUT THERE. THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR WATER RIGHTS WHICH YOU CREATE AND THE STATE WITH THE STATE WOULD PURCHASE THEM AND BASICALLY BACK LIKE A BANK WOULD HOLD ON TO THESE RIGHTS THE STATE WOULD WOULD WOULD HOLD THAT AS A AS A KID AS A COMMODITY RIGHT AND WHAT PLEASE WOULD LOOK FOR AT FIRST HIS THOSE HIGH STRESS AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING ALLOCATIONS RIGHT- AT THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT THOSE AREAS TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY SELLERS. WOULD HAVE THAT AND WE WOULD PURCHASE THE RIGHTS OR REPORTS AN EASEMENT OUT LEGALLY HOW WHAT WHAT WAS AVAIL AND ALLOW THAT WATER TO EITHER BE FLOODED ON THE ON THE PROPERTY AND- ARE FOR GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT OR- YEAH IT JUST FROM THERE'S IT'S THERE'S AN OVER OF DEMAND OF WATER ANYWAY- BUT THE PRIORITY WOULD BE ON ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS AND SORT OF MAXIMIZING. THAT THE BENEFITS. WELL IF I MAY HELP- THE OUTLOOK ON IDEA AND THE IDEA IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A RELIABLE QUANTIFICATION OF WHAT THE WATER RIGHTS ARE WE KNOW THAT THE RIGHT TO HEAR I OF SENIOR WATER RIGHTS HAVE GREAT BUT OUR RIGHTS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS AT LEAST TO GET THE STATE WATER RESOURCE BOARD TO DO SOME QUANTIFICATION OF. OF THOSE- RIGHTS- IN YOU KNOW HELP HELP WITH THE YOU KNOW- THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS AND GET THEIR WATER WELL I WANT TO JUST GO ON RECORD BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BECOME A GREAT DEBATE. THIS YEAR. I WANNA GO ON RECORD TO STATE THE FACT I AM THE ONLY FARMER I BELIEVE IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND WHEN IT COMES TO WATER RIGHTS YOU'RE NO A WILLING SELLER UNTIL YOU CAN'T FARM ANYMORE. AND WHY YOU CAN'T FARMS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. INERGY COST WE HAVE WE HAVE MORE REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAN WE DO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD SO. I OWN ALL MY LAND I OWN ALL MY EQUIPMENT. AND MY FAMILY'S BEEN FARMING CALIFORNIA FOR NINETY TWO YEARS. AND I AM HAVING A HARD TIME MY MARGINS ARE REALLY THIN IT'S NOT BECAUSE- I'M I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING IS BECAUSE I'M COMPETING IT'S THE GUY IN OREGON THE GUY NEVADA AND THE GUY IN CHINA. OR UKRAINE TO PRODUCE A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIANS NEED TO I'M NOT A WILLING SELLER OF MY WATER RIGHTS OR MY LAND OR CONSERVATION EASEMENT UNTIL I'M FORCED TO WHERE THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE A LIVING ON MY PROPERTY AND I WILL TELL YOU. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF FARMERS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE IN THAT POSITION BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE PUT IN THAT POSITION THERE'S NOT ONE DIME. IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR STORAGE. WHERE IS IT. WHERE IS THAT WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE MONEY TO BUILD SITES RESERVOIR WILL ACTUALLY HELP THE ENVIRONMENT HELP FARMERS AND HELP PEOPLE THAT WOULDN'T SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE CITIES IT'S NOT IN HERE. THIS IS THE BUDGET THIS IS THE SENATE'S PLAN I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS RIGHT THIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL IT'S RIDICULOUS. AND WE TALK ABOUT YEAH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF WILLING SELLERS WHEN THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE A LIVING ANYMORE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE FORCING THEM INTO A CORNER WHERE THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPTION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE A LIVING ON THE PROPERTY AND SO WE AND I WANT TO JUST SAY THIS I'VE WORKED WITH THE FOLKS IN SISKIYOU COUNTY. TO DO SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS. WITH WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. WE ARE TRYING TO GET A SAFE ARE WE CAN WE CAN. WITH THEIR THEY'RE DIVERTING. ACTUALLY GIVING IT UP AT NO COST AGREEMENT WHICH CHUCK BONHAM HASN'T SIGNED YET AT THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE WE WILL WORK ON TEN YEARS AND THEY'VE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THEIR OWN MONEY. NOW THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE WILLING SELLERS WHEN THEY CAN'T MAKE A LIVING ANYMORE. YOU'RE GONNA FORCE THEM TO BE WILLING SELLERS SELLERS THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS POLICIES COME OUT OF THIS PLACE. IF YOU THINK THAT YOUR I'M SORRY. IF YOU THINK THAT COMMUNITIES AND FARMERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FEED CALIFORNIA IN THE WORLD WITHOUT. CREATING MORE WATER WE HAVE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS A WHAT IS YOURS ON HISTORY. AND WE DIDN'T SAY THAT WATER LETTING IT OUT AND IS GOING TO THE OCEAN. THE PLANET HAS 75% OF THE PLANET IS WATER. FOR GOD'S SAKE YOU THINK WE COULD GET SOME MORE AND STORE IT. TO THE WE HAVE IT IN DROUGHT YEARS. WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN THIS BUILDING ALL THE TIME CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT THE SOLUTION. IS THE PROBLEM. WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT. IT FOR. ABOUT STORING MORE WATER CATCHING IT BECAUSE IT'S COMING UP EARLIER WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT WE JUST TALK ABOUT PENALIZING PEOPLE OR PAYING BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF MONEY IN CALIFORNIA JUST BUY STUFF BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE ECONOMY DOESN'T HELP TO COMMUNITIES AS DESTROYING AGRICULTURE IN THE WAY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME MONEY PUT IN THIS BUDGET TO BUILD SITES RESERVOIR. NOBODY DISPUTES THAT IT'S NOT. A GREAT PROJECT. ENVIRONMENTALISTS LIKE IT. LABOUR LIKES IT AG LIKES IT THIS APOLOGIES LIKE IT AND WHAT WE GETTING NOTHING NOT ONE RED PENNY GOING TOWARDS RIDICULOUS WHAT PERHAPS SENATOR IF YOU READ THROUGH THE REST OF THE SENATE PROPOSAL YOU WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO IMPROVE THE WATERSHED CLIMATE RESILIENCY REGIONALLY THIS WOULD IMPROVE THE WATERSHEDS THAT WOULD ALLOW MORE WATER TO END UP IN THE EXISTING DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE DOESN'T INCREASE CAPACITY BUT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN THE IS PARTICULARLY IN THE UPPER WATERSHED. THAT WILL IMPROVE IT IN THE IN THE WHAT YEARS THAT WOULD IMPROVE YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME SOURCE. THE SOURCE OF WHERE THE WATER'S COMING FROM AS WELL AS THE ONE POINT FIVE. BILLION TO IMPROVE THAT SAFE DRINKING WATER SOME OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO BE WATERSHED WORK BECAUSE THAT THAT WATER DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE AND LESS IT'S CLEAN FROM THE REMNANTS OF THE FIRE OR THE DESTRUCTION THIS OCCURRED. IN IN YOUR DISTRICT AND SENATE MCGUIRE SISTER WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED SO THAT'S THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS NECESSARY WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN YOURS IN SENATOR MCGUIRE'S DISTRICTS LARGELY TO IMPROVE. THE DAMS THE OPERATION OF THE DAMS IN THE WATER THAT'S AVAILABLE AT THAT THOSE AT THOSE FACILITIES TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR THE DROUGHT THE DROUGHT RESILIENT- GRANTS. TO ASSIST WITH RESPECT WHICH IS DOWNSTREAM WHICH MIGHT BE IN MY DISTRICT WORK WHERE PEOPLE USE IT SO THAT WE REDUCE THE STRESSORS ON ON. ON THE- FACILITIES. SO THERE IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE ARE THERE'S THINGS IN THERE AND- WE'LL SEE WHO'S RIGHT I MEAN IF THIS GETS APPROVED. WE'LL SEE WHO COMES FOR BECAUSE I THINK YOUR OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT THERE'S SOME. THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY OCCURRED TO MEMBERS AND THE AGRICULTURE COMMISSION. OR COMMUNITY THEY THEY THEY THE PICTURE THAT YOU'VE PAINTED IS ALREADY IT OCURRED OCCURRED PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN- RENDER BUSINESS HERE BUT- IT COULD DO NOTHING. INTO JUICE WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE MORE WATER I GUESS IS FOR CREATING IS BUYING SOMEBODY'S RIGHTS SO THAT THERE'S MORE AVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF THE PEOPLE THAT. IT I DON'T WILL RIGHTS YOU DO YOU DO SO IF WE VICE OF THESE THERE'S MORE WATER HELPS. THE REMAINING PEOPLE IN THE SECTOR THAT'S THE THEORY RIGHT WELL IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WHETHER IT'S NOT IT'S GOOD OF AFFECTED NOT BUT THERE ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE. PEOPLE NOW THAT. WOULD BE WILLING TO SELL THE RIGHT IT'S WHICH WOULD. A BANK OF ONE RIGHTS THAT THE LITTLE WATER AVAILABLE COULD GO TO THE REMAINING ENTITIES THAT USE IT. HOW ABOUT US DISCRETES MORE WATER WE HAVEN'T CREATED NEW WATER IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS AND WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THERE'S NOBODY THAT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT THE WATERSHED AND I AND I WILL I WILL GIVE YOU THE FACT THAT. YES THEY DO THE STRUCTURE HOLDS THE WATER BUT THERE'S A WATERSHED. ABOVE THOSE STRUCTURES THAT IS THE REAL THE REAL. RESERVOIRS AND IS BURNING UP AND I AND LAST YEAR WE PUT EARLY ACTION MONEY IN. AND WE WERE GOING TO GET ON THE GROUND WE'RE GONNA PROTECT OUR WATER. BECAUSE WE'RE SO FAR BEHIND THE CURVE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT DONE GOOD FORCE MANAGEMENT FOR THE LAST. FORTY YEARS- LOOK I'M ALL FOR THAT BUT THIS THIS THIS RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR. I CAME TO THE SENATE FLOOR WITH THE- WHOLE STACK FULL OF ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS THAT WE DIDN'T FUND BECAUSE WE GAVE THE MONEY TO CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T GIVE IT TO THE R. C. D.'S. AND THE FIRE SAY KILL. AND THE CAN. SO LOOK I'M ON I'M ON OF THAT BILL IN TOTAL CREATE WATER INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING WATER FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND PAYING THEM FOR BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN'T MAKE A LIVING MORE. FINE I JUST WANT TO WRECK THAT THERE IS NO MONEY IN YOUR STORAGE. LIKE A STRUCTURAL STE. YEAH I GUESS MAYBE I'LL GET TO AND MAKE TO PAY. THE L. A. THIS. THESE RIGHT IN THE WATER. IN THAT SAFE ONE OF THESE PER- ON A TIME. IN ORDER TO DO IT DAM ORCHARD BUILD SITES THEM ISN'T THAT YEARS IN THE YEAR IN THE MAKE. WELL RATHER THE FOR POLLS THAT ARE BEFORE US THIS THIS PACK FAR THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK ON THE MEDIA. I MEAN JUST THE JUST FROM A TECH POINT OF THIS IN IS IN. ISN'T THAT THE- ANY THAT WE WILL TO BUILD TAKE YEARS BUILD VERSUS THE- YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENTS ON WATERSHED. REESE FOR. A PURCHASING WATER RIGHTS FLOOD MAN. CAN HAVE IMMEDIATELY OR- NOT TO MEET BUT- IN A MUCH SHORTER LINE. IDEA TYPICALLY LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PRO PROJECTS TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING AND- AND FUND RAISING- AND MULTIPLE PARTIES INVOLVED THOSE CAN TAKE MANY YEARS OBVIOUSLY SMALLER PROJECTS MORE DISCREET EASIER PROJECTS OFTEN CAN BE DONE MORE QUICKLY. THE SENATE REQUIRE. IT IS FOR TO MENTION SITES IT IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FULLY ACCURATE ON SITES STAYS INVESTED ONE POINT ONE PROXIMALLY BILLION DOLLARS. JOE BIDEN. DEMOCRATS HAS JUST INVESTED TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. INCISORS WAS JUST ANNOUNCED- ABOUT SIXTY DAYS AGO ZERO DOLLARS DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JUST ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING SUPER CLEAR ABOUT SITES. PSYTRANCE ARE RECEIVED IN THE LAST ROUND THE STATE FUNDING THE LARGEST FUNDING ALLOCATION OUT OF ANY OTHER WATER STORAGE PROJECT. THERE IS GONNA NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WILL NEED TO BE ALLOCATED FROM THE STATE BUT I JUST WANNA BE SUPER CLEAR. SO WE'RE NOT POSTURING JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT THIRTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS JUST CAME FROM A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION. ON WHAT WILL BE. THE LARGEST WATER STORAGE PROJECT THIS STATE IS SEEN. IN DECADES JUST WANT TO BE SUPER CLEAR ABOUT THAT- AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS LET'S BE SUPER CLEAR WHAT'S IN THIS BUDGET THOUGH. WHAT IS WHAT IS IN THIS BUDGET HERE WE HAVE. FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE LAYING AROUND THAT WE COULD PUT INTO IT SO AS WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD ANYTHING OUGHT NOT TO HAVE MILLION ONE BILLION I TOTALLY AGREE. AND THAT'S WHY THE STATE IN THIS LAST ROUND. SECURE OVER BILLION DOLLARS SHORT THAT'S WHY THAT THE PRESIDENT'S MOVE FORWARD WITH TWO BILLION. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO MENTION WITHIN THIS. BILL SEVEN MEDIA NEEDS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR COMMUNITIES CROSS THE STATE WHEN IT COMES EMERGENCY WATER STORAGE. ANTI PROJECTS ADDITIONAL WELLS. IN CELL HI I'M NOT ARGUING HERE- MR SENATOR WHATSOEVER WE NEED TO DO BOTH BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON ADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS REGARDS TO THE REST OF OUR. OKAY WE'LL AGREE TO DISAGREE THAT DID THAT PERHAPS PERHAPS THE SAVINGS THAT SPRING PUT AND UNDER THE SAFE TRAIN BY ARE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THE WATER THAT THEY DID THAT CONSUMER ISSUES AND THE OTHERS SOME MIGHT NOT BE A DIRECT INVESTMENT- IN STORAGE BUT WE THE IDEA HERE AND I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM A MORE AVAILABLE WATER- BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE IT RAIN. I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THE- PROPOSAL ON WILDFIRES WHICH IS THE SIX YEAR OR- A MULTI YEAR SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR FIVE YEAR PROGRAM HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION FOR- THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKS ALL THE ITEMS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED THE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION FOR- CONSERVANCIES THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THE NINETY FIVE MILLION FOR BIO MASS COMMUNICATION AND THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR- READ FUEL REDUCTION PER YEAR. NONE OF THAT AT THIS MOMENT IS ALLOCATED TO CAL FIRE ALL OF THAT IS OPEN OBVIOUSLY THE CONSERVANCY SURCHARGE DIRECT AND THE BIOMASS CAL FIVE DOESN'T DO. MUCH AND BIOMASS BUT NONE OF THAT MONEY IS ALLOCATED TO THE TRADITIONAL- PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM WITH CAL FIRE IT HASN'T BEEN ALLOCATED YET BUT JUST SO AS WE SIT HERE TODAY. WE SIT HERE TODAY THIS IS NOT A- THIS IS THIS IS NOT THE MONEY THAT'S ALLOCATED TO CAL FIRE DIRECTLY SO WE'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS AS WE'VE HAD IT DIFFERENT TIMES THROUGHOUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN CHAIRING THIS COMMITTEE ON WHERE THAT MONEY WHICH IS HIS BEST TO GO BUT WE'VE CALLED. THE CONSERVANCY'S ON A YEARLY BASIS THIS IS SPEECH HERE IN THE VADA THE TAHOE CONSERVANCIES AND ALL THE OTHER CONSERVANCY CCC YEARLY BASIS THE D. INVESTMENT THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE TOWARDS- IN A MULTI YEAR. A SCHEME SO WE'RE WE'RE FIGURING THAT THAT'S THE TYPE OF LONG TERM PLANNING THAT ARE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE COUNTIES ARE. TRUST OUR EMAIL AND THE AND THE CONSERVANCY'S AND ALL THE OTHER- ORGANIZATIONS THEIR CAN ALLOW FOR AS A- SERIOUS INVESTMENT INTO FUELS REDUCTION ON THE- ON THE FLOOR. OF THE OF THE FORCE SO THAT'S STILL HASN'T BEEN JUST SO WE KNOW. WHAT'S WHERE WE SIT RIGHT NOW- I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK FOR COMMENT FROM THE ALEJO IS EIGHT IF. WE SORT OF CREATED A MOSAIC HERE WE'RE- AN AGENCY OR REALIZADO COASTAL CONSERVANCY COULD LOOK AT YOU KNOW. SOME BIODIVERSITY MONEY FOR- OUTDOOR ACCESS THAT MIGHT MAY ACTUALLY DO SOME WETLAND. RESTORATION AND SOME WILDFIRE- REMEDIATION BY BIOMASS SECURE MAIL ACCUMULATIONS AS WELL AS HELP OUT THE SEAL. SEALABLE IS THAT HOW YOU GUYS READ. THE INITIAL- THE PROPOSAL. MISTER CAN YOU CLARIFY IS ARE YOU FROM QUESTIONING WHETHER A PROJECT THAT DID ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THIS FUNDING OR RIGHT I MEAN I GUESS WE'RE WE'RE YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIMES WE'RE WE SILO- WE SILO THING OR IF YOU ONLY GET MONEY IF YOU DO THIS AND THIS PROPOSAL AT LEAST THIS IS SITTING RIGHT NOW IT'S SUBJECT TO THE CHANGES ALLOWS FOR- ACTORS. IN WHETHER THEY'RE RURAL CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINOUS CALIFORNIA THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT THESE PROPOSALS. DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE SEALEVEL RISE. IN BIODIVERSITY AND WEB TOGETHER THEIR PROPOSALS TO HOPEFULLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT. PARTS OF TO- THAT ARE THERE. DID YOU DID YOU WHEN YOU READ IT DID YOU SEE THAT OR IF NOT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR. YEAH I MEAN IN A I THINK ONE POINT E WOULD JUST MAKE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE DETAILS DO MATTER SO AS THE PACKAGE BECOMES STRUCTURES DURING NEGOTIATIONS IF THE INTENT IS THAT. APPLICANTS MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE A MULTI BENEFIT PROJECT OR- ACHIEVE MULTIPLE GOALS. THINKING ABOUT WHICH ADMINISTERING AGENCIES YOU HAVE HOW GRANTS ARE SET UP- WHAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS WILL BE. OFTEN WE DO HEAR FROM A LOCAL ENTITIES THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT THAT THEY HAVE TO APPLY FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT. GRANT PROGRAMS JUST TO FINISH ONE SPECIFIC PROJECT- SO AS YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR PACKAGE TOGETHER THAT IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT EASY- AND REMOVED. AND TRY AND ADDRESS MULTIPLE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT PRICING DAY. MAY BE FACING YOU KNOW THEY MAY HAVE THE OCEAN COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR AND WILDFIRE COMING IN THE BACK DOOR SO- THINKING THINKING ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS FUNDING WILL BE AN IMPORTANT DETAIL TO WORK OUT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS SEVEN EARNED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION FOUR- THE- MEETING THE GOAL OF CONSERVING 30% OF THE STATE'S LANDS IN COASTAL WATERS BY THE YEAR TWENTY. THIRTY TWO ADVANCED BIO DIVERSITY- AND ELEVATE THE ROLE OF NATURE THE FIGHT AGAINST. CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT TYPE OF IMPACT IF YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WOULDN'T ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THIS PROPOSAL HAVE FOR. ACHIEVING THAT BIO DIVERSITY GOALS. SO I THINK. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK AGAIN WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE STRUCTURING THIS PACKAGE TO BE COMPLEMENTARY- WHEN I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I KNOW WE DISCUSSING THIS PACK YOU KNOW THE NATURE BASE PACKAGE- ANTISEPTIC. HEARING WITHIN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED I'M ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT. WHERE EXACTLY THAT WILL GET US- IN TERMS OF MEETING THOSE THE PERSON WITH A THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS- IN SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE THAT IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE OKAY WELL. IS THAT WE KNOW WE KNOW KIND OF WHERE WE ARE PERCENTAGE WISE IN TERMS OF- AND CONCERT COMPANY TO CONSERVATION WE KNOW WE WANT TO GET THE THIRTY PERCENT. BACK HOW FAR WILL THE MANY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING GAS AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS TRYING TO QUANTIFY THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. WHAT THAT WILL GET US AND THEN HOW MUCH THIS CAN YOU CAN SORT OF COMPLEMENT THAT AND I THINK AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE LEGISLATURE CAN PROBABLY YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS YOU KNOW. THINK ABOUT WAYS TO MODIFY THAT AND HOW IT IS TO FILL IN THOSE GAPS AND REALLY MAYBE EVEN CONSIDER TARGETING THAT DEFINES THE EXTENT POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF MEASURABLE BENEFITS AND HELP US GET THIS GOAL TO EXTENT THOSE ARE THE GOALS REALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS- AND IF THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THE- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. CALLS I DON'T. HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER IN TERMS. OF WHAT. YEAH YEAH GET. THAT THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS YOU KNOW YOU. YOU TAKE THIRTY PER. OF THE LAN MASS THAT'S A NUMBER THAT'S JUST. ACREAGE RIGHT. OUR HOW MAY. SQUARE MILES AND THEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE. BY PROJECTS THAT THAT REALLY YOU KNOW. THE DAYS THERE'S THE SCIENCE BASED. BIODIVERSITY ELEMENT OF IT IS GIGANTIC IT'S A BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG IT'S NOT THAT BIG IT'S CRITICAL. FOR THAT AREA AND IT MIGHT EVEN LINK. TO OTHER AREAS ARE ON IT ADJACENT SITE SO YOU BE A WONDERFUL. SPOT BUT IT'S- IN THE AIR- AT AS FAR AS BEING. REACHING A THIRTY PERCENT- ELEMENT IN THE HOLES ON THE LINE MASSES THEY BECOME. IT'S A LOT SO. OTHER OTHERS MAY BE SOME BIG SWAT SIMPLE. THAT ARE SORT OF YOU KNOW IT'S GOT BIODIVERSITY IT IT IT MEETS ALL THE REQUIREMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT THE- CREME DE LA CREME AS FAR AS- DID THEN THE DESIRED THE NEED TO PROTECT IT RIGHT BUT IT MAY HELP US ON THIS GOAL SO. THAT'S IT THE STRUGGLE THAT I HAVE SO I. GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU GUYS ARE THINKING ABOUT THE SAME THING BECAUSE WILL BE LOOKING FOR- INPUT THERE- ON THE CLIMATE EQUITY TRUST WE KNOW IT'S A CONTINUING PROBLEM THAT THE PRICE OF UTILITIES ENERGY AND PRICE OF WATER- THAT THAT FOLKS HAVE- DO YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS. I MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN DIFFERENT AVENUES IS WE'VE WE'VE INCLUDING ASPECT OF THIS HERE. RESEARCHER THIS IS ROSS BROWN- YEAH I MEAN I THINK ON THE ELECTRICITY SIDE AT LEAST AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF YOU KNOW. DETAILS COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT CERTAINLY AT A HIGH LEVEL. HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RAISED AS A PROBLEM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE THINKING ABOUT TRYING TO ADDRESS ON A GOING FORWARD AMOUNTS FOR. A VARIETY OF REASONS YOU KNOW INCLUDING SWORDS WE CANNOT MAKE REASONS- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY EQUITY REASONS YOU KNOW LIKE TRICITY- RATES ARE EXPECTS THAT THEY'RE HIGHER THAN YOUR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND OF THEIR GREATER SHARE OF THEIR- INCOME ON ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY USAGE AND- BUT FINALLY YOU KNOW I MEAN FAR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVES- WITH HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES ARE GOING TO. HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON KIND OF FUEL CONSUMERS DECISIONS TO ADOPT- THINGS LIKE ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR A LEFT SEARCHING OUT NATURAL GAS APPLIANCES OR ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES SO. ON THE OTHER COULD BE SORT OF ADVERSE- EFFECTS OR AT LEAST MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING TO MEET SOME OF THE STATE'S CHRONICLES WITH THOSE HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES AND SO. ON YOU KNOW FINDING WAYS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WHETHER WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH STATE KIND OF THE STATE BUDGET IN STATE SPENDING OR OTHER REGULATORY CHANGES ARE CHANGES TO KIND OF THE RATE STRUCTURE- THAT UTILITIES USED TO. COLLECT THE REVENUE- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT KIND OF ALL DIFFERENT WAYS TO IT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SEEMS LIKE AN ISSUE GOING FORWARD. YEAH I KNOW WE A- A AUCTION THE CAP AND TRADE NEXT WEEK ON THE EIGHTEENTH ON ON WEDNESDAY AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION THAT OPINION HAS BEEN REYES- SO FAR AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENCES WITH FINANCE- AT FINANCES- NUMBERS SOMEWHAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDING- YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THERE WILL BE. OVER BILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE AUCTION NEXT WEEK SO WE'RE GOING TO BE IN THE FOUR POINT FIVE. BILLION DOLLAR- RANGE WHICH I THINK IS A JUST. OF DISCRETION. FIGURE OF ONE SEVEN BILL IS THIS SOME. SHE WE BE LOOKING THAT. THE GIVEN THE- APPARENT INCREASE IN THE- THE AUCTION PROCEEDS. YEAH I MEAN I THINK G. R. F. IS GONNA ONE FUN SOURCE TO BE LOOKING AT- FOR YOU KNOW KIND OF ANY OF THE POTENTIAL KIND OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- WE HAVE DONE SOME RECENT- ANALYSIS ON AUCTION REVENUES IN THE- THE FEBRUARY AUCTION KIND OF CAME IN HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS. A SPECIMEN AND IT'S JANUARY BUDGET SO WE ALREADY HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT. OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE COMING ABOUT THOSE EXPECTATIONS I THINK OF THAT. BY MARKET PRICES MAINSTAYS SORT OF WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE EXTRA. THEIR REVENUES TO EXCEED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE- ASSUMPTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THE JANUARY I THINK ARE MOST RECENT- SUGGESTED WE THOUGHT THERE COULD BE A REFUND ABOUT ONE POINT SIX SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN DISCRETIONARY. REVENUE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S GENERAL CLICK SUBMIT YOUR PACKAGE OF COURSE KIND OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY ALL GETS DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW WHAT IT. ATTENTION BUT RISKED IT HAS- YOU KNOW KIND OF THE PROJECT FOR REVENUE TO TAKE- TAKE A DOWNTURN IN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO BUT THAT'S KIND OF NUMBER THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED AS- IF THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT FOR STARTING IT'S JUST. ABOUT HOW MUCH- HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR AND SO JUST FOR COMPARISON THE ADMINISTRATION'S. PROPOSAL INCLUDE ABOUT A ONE BILLION DOLLAR G. G. R. PACKAGE SO WE THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING AND THERE'S LIKELY TO BE SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE AS PART OF THIS. THIS YEAR'S PACKAGE HOW RELIABLE ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES NUMBERS I MEAN THIS IS THE SIXTH YEARS THAT I'VE CHAIRED THIS THIS COMMITTEE EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THIS. ON CAP AND TRADE ON WHAT THE EXPECTED OPTIONS WERE IN THERE- FOR SIX COMPARED TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE PREDICTING WHAT THE BAILABLE MONEY WOULD BE MEAN EACH YEAR. THEY LOW BALL THE AMOUNT AN N. HOLD BACK THE LEGISLATURE ABILITY TO INVEST IN. THE CLIMATE- AND- THE- CHALLENGES THAT WE YEAH WE TALK THAT WE HAVE TO ACTION WE TALK ABOUT THE MEDIA'S SEE- IN IN IN THAT I THINK IS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID PEOPLE ARE HURT AND WHEN IT COMES SAID THE AREN'T YOU BILLS IN THE WATER BILLS GAS PRICES IT JUST SEEMS LIKE MAYBE WILL I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE REVISITING THIS SO- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT'S A- AS- POTENTIAL SOURCE ANYTHING ELSE- THE SELLER. HOURS ON THE PACKAGE IF WE CAN BE HELPFUL THINK WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT- IT'S THERE'S A LOT TO READ TO THE PUBLIC IS DIGESTING IT- OUR VISITS I THERE IS A FIFTY TWO PAGE STAFF REPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE LIKE TO LOOK AT IT- YES SENATE DAHLE YOU RECKON I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT- I APPRECIATE CENTER REQUIRE COMING OVER AND VISITING WITH ME ABOUT. THAT WE AGREE WE JUST WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR SOME OF THESE PROJECTS BUT I WHAT DID WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT I DO I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM I'M ASSUMING MONEY FROM FOLKS THAT WORK FOR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND WORK WITH CAL FIRE THERE WAS A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED- FOR. TO BE AWARDED- FOR FOREST HEALTH. AND ONLY NINETY EIGHT MILLION OF IT WAS- ACTUALLY. ALLOCATED OUT SO THERE WAS AND THEN THERE WAS A TOTAL REQUEST FOR A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS- AND I KNOW FOR A FACT WE HAVE THE DIXIE. HIGHWAY THE DIXIE FIRE LAST YEAR. THERE'S A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AWARD FOR RICK REFORESTATION- ON. THE INDUSTRIAL LANDS- BUT WE ASK FOR ANOTHER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COME IN- FOR NON INDUSTRIAL LANDOWNERS AND SO I WANTED TO NOTE THAT- THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR- TO HELP THOSE NON INDUSTRIAL LAND OWNERS AS WELL- WHERE WE SAW THE DEVASTATION THE DIXIE FIRE. AND THEN THE LAST THING I WANTED TO MENTION WAS- THAT- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL- OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE HAD SEVERAL- THAT OF ONE OUT AND WE'RE DOING. TRYING TO MEET OUR- FOR- FITTING OR FORCED NOT THAT IS THE- OUR- ACCOUNT. TO KALIFORNIA THE CONSERVANCY'S- BUT SINCE AND SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE- OVER MANY YEARS WELL. THE CONTRACTORS BID THOSE JOBS- TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AT AND THE- COST OF. OFF HIGHWAY DIESEL AT THE TIME WAS LIKE. THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS WELL IT'S SIX IT'S DOUBLED ALMOST DOUBLED IN THE TIME. TO THOSE CONTRACTORS. LITERALLY. ARE USING. FOR EVERY PIECE OF A- IS IT'S THEIR DRUMMING MONEY THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE COST OF THE INCREASE IN DIESEL- AND SOLD BECAUSE THEIR BID WAS SET AT A COST WERE DIESEL SO MUCH LOWER SO. I WANTED TO I'VE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE- BEEN CHATTING WITH SENATOR REQUIRE- BUT I WANT TO JUST LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I THINK WE NEED TO IN THE BUDGET- ACROSS THE STATE. ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR THOSE CONTRACTORS WHO HAVE ALREADY BID THE JOBS BECAUSE THE COST IS INCREASED WE WANT TO KEEP THEM WORKING. AND THEY'RE SHUT DOWN UNTIL THE FUEL COMES DOWN BECAUSE THEY JUST THEY'RE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THEY'RE NOT JUST A BUSINESS IF THEY'RE LOSING MONEY SO. MAYBE MAYBE THE ALEJO CAN REMEMBER I THOUGHT THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR WAS FOR. TWENTY MILLION IN TRANSFER ABOUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT BOTTOM I'M TALKING. THAT WAS FOR MOVING CHIPS TO THE BIOMASS PLANT YES WE PUT THAT IN. I'M TALKING ABOUT. EXISTING WHO A BIT TO DO. THINGS AND- CONSERVATION WERE IN THE FOR. IN A WILDLY. WHO HAVE BUILT A PROJECT AT SAY LET'S SAY FIFTY TO UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE. AND THEIR COST OF DIESEL WAS AT THE TIME TO RUN THEIR QUICKNESS. RIGHT WAS. THREE DOLLARS AND TWENTY CENTS A GALLON AND NOW IT'S SIX TWENTY FIVE IT'S DOUBLED SO. THEY'RE THERE THEY CAN'T. BROWN AT A LOSS AND SO THEY'RE JUST SITTING IDLE BECAUSE FEW SO EITHER LOSING MONEY. SO WE NEEDED. ALLOW IN THE CONTRACTS TO SUBSIDIZE THEM FOR THE COST OF DIESEL GOING UP OR WE'RE NOT GOING TO MEET OUR GOALS. VERY GOOD SO. SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US AT LEAST WITH THE WILD. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO TAKE THE TWO MILLION THAT'S IN THE CAPTURE PROGRAM ON A NAY. PAY PLUS ADDING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR. AND THEN THE SAME THING NEXT YEAR TAKE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND ADD FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO MAKE SIX MILLION. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD TAKE THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND DOUBLE IT. MORE THAN DOUBLE IT TO ONE POINT THREE TWO. BILLION A YEAR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ON THE OUT YEARS ON THE THIRD YEAR IN THE FOURTH YEAR AND THE FIFTH YEAR. ALL WE HAVE IS THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY WHICH- WAS OUR IDEA HERE IN SEPT TWO BUT WHO CARES. BUT THAT THAT MONEY A TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND- VERSUS. THE GOVERNOR HAS TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND WE HAVE ONE POINT THREE MILLION AND YEARS THREE. FOUR AND FIVE SETS A SIGNIFICANT. HORIZON THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PAINT AT LEAST. IT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH BUT AT LEAST THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN WHAT. THE NEW SEMESTER. HAS PROPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATURE. OKAY MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT TO THEIR ACOSTA THE INFLATIONARY. FOR DIESEL. AND ALL UNTIL WE CAN MAKE THAT DEALT UP THEY CAN KEEP NOT THE GOAL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER. I HAVE NO IDEA TO GIVES PRAGYA YOU. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE CONTRACTORS CAN STAY IN BUSINESS. AND TREAT THE LAND WHEN YOU TREATED ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP FOR PER. HEARING THERE MAY. OF THE HERE- THAT WOULD LIKE- ADDRESSED THE COMMITTEE EITHER ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE RUSSIAN NUMBER TWO WERE BOTH OF THEM PLEASE COME FORWARD THERE'S A MICROPHONE. HI MODERATOR YOU CAN- STAR.

COMBINED WITH THE REPURPOSED SCENE MONIES. OF ALL JUST REALLY. REDUCING FOOD ACREAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AT A TIME WHEN WE THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT FOOD SECURITY. AND ACTUALLY HOW DO WE KEEP MORE ACRES IN PRODUCTION. AND HOW DO WE KEEP. MORE ACRES PRODUCING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMICAL ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHICH WE DO BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE NATION. OR SUFFERING A SIGNIFICANT DROUGHT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MAJOR ISSUES WITH GROUND WATER. AT THE SAME TIME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS DISPLACING PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL ACRES THAT PROVIDE A SECURITY MEASURE FOR OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. WE THINK THOSE NEED TO BE. DISCUSSED IN IN GREATER- DEPTH- WE SEE AND FROM THE RICE COMMISSION IN PARTICULAR WE SEE CONCERNS WITH THE ACREAGE IN THE DISCUSSION OF FOCUSING ON AREAS LIKE RICE WHICH WE BELIEVE WE'VE DONE BETTER THAN GOVERNMENT CAN EVER DO. AND UTILIZING THAT PROPERTY WE CREATE FOOD WE CREATE JOBS WE CREATE MORE WETLANDS ACREAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. AND YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE THIS FOCUS OF COMING AFTER IN TRYING TO PURCHASE THESE PROPERTIES. LET'S TRY TO DEVELOP A PARTNERSHIP IN THIS AREA SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO WHAT E DO. WE DID A STUDY JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IT WOULD COST ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE. TO CONVERT THE RICE PLANTS THAT WE HAVE INTO WETLANDS NO ONE WOULD EVER MAKE THAT INVESTMENT IF THERE'S NO RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT GET THE RICE INDUSTRY PUTS MONEY INTO THAT EVERY YEAR AND NOT ONLY DO WE MAKE IT ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL WE CREATE A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FOR THOSE AREAS IN THE STATE. LASTLY WE LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST SOME MONIES. PUT TOGETHER THIS YEAR FOR DROUGHT RELIEF IN THESE COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR IN THE RICE INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ACRES WITH THAT COMES THE IMPACT TO BUSINESSES. SCHOOLS COMMUNITIES WE SAW BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITY SHUT DOWN DUE TO COPE IT WE'RE GOING TO SEE SIMILAR IMPACTS IN A LOT OF AREAS IN THE STATE THAT'LL SEE. ACREAGE THIS BEING FOLLOWED TO THE DROUGHT BUSINESS WILL BE IMPACTED THEY NEED ASSISTANCE TO GET THROUGH THIS SO THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN SURVIVE AND CONTINUE TO EXIST SO WHEN WE COME OUT THE BACKSIDE OF THIS DROUGHT.

GREAT ALL THE COMEDIC SEEMS TO BE ONE PERSON BUT I GUESS THAT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC FOR A DIFFERENT TIME ALTHOUGH I DO WONDER WHERE THE LAWMAKERS ARE- BUT THAT BEING SAID THE BUDGET- IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME. AS IT RELATES TO FIRES BECAUSE I'M A DISPLACED PERSON FROM SONOMA COUNTY DUE TO THE TUBBS FIRE. AND AS A RESULT OF TUBS ME AND MY FAMILY OF SIX. INCLUDING MY FOUR CHILDREN WERE WERE DISPLACED THROUGH THAT HORRIFIC. EVENT SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION A COUPLE THINGS IN TERMS OF WATER AND IN TERMS OF THE FIRES. SO READING FROM A CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE FROM PRIL TWENTY SEVENTH SINCE YOUR TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE APPROVED EIGHT WATER BONDS TOTALING MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND APPROVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO MORE. THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO SAY DROUGHTS ARE NATURE'S FAULT THEY ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING WATER SHORTAGES ARE THE FAULT OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. CALIFORNIA WATER SHORTAGES FALLS SQUARELY ON FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND NOW ON GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. RATHER THAN BUILD THE DESPERATELY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO COLLECT AND STORE WATER DURING WET YEARS GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN A NEW WATER CONSERVATION ACT THAT WILL LIMIT EACH CITIZEN TO JUST FIFTY OR FIFTY FIVE GALLONS OF WATER PER PERSON PER DAY. BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY. FOUR TERMS OF WILDFIRES I WANTED TO READ A LITTLE BIT- FROM AN ARTICLE FROM JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BY BRANDON REGIMEN FROM ABC TEN. NINETY EIGHT SITTING MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AM PAYING MONEY FROM. THE GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY AFTER THE COMPANY WAS CONVICTED OF SIX FEDERAL FELONIES AND PLACED ON PROBATION WITH A MANDATORY COURT MONITOR. EIGHT OUT OF EVERY TEN SITTING LAWMAKERS SO IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BUDGET AS IT RELATES TO BOTH WILD FIRES AND WATER AT THIS HEARING IN MY PERSPECTIVE. NOT ONLY DID IT WALK LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS. IT SEEMS TO BE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SMOKE AND MIRRORS NO PUN INTENDED OF THIS LEGISLATURE I HEARING TAKING PLACE AT THE END OF A DOMINO EFFECT OF CATASTROPHIC POLICIES. THAT HAVE CAUSED CALIFORNIA TO BE IN THE BEST BUT IT IS WITH RESPECT TO THESE FIRES AND WATER. THE BLAME WHICH BUT I THE LADY CITIZEN PAYING THE MOST BASIC ATTENTION TO THIS. TRIBUTE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THE CALL ME SKEPTICAL WHEN I ASK WHAT YOU WILL DO THE LEGISLATOR WE DID SET UP ANOTHER TASK FORCE ANOTHER COMMITTEE AT THE CALIFORNIA CARBON PLANS.
