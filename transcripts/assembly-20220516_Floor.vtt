. FOR YEARS WE HAVE WITNESSED

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.638
FAR TOO MANY TRAGEDIES AND

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.239
PATTERNS OF AN INCONSISTENCY

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:11.541
BECAUSE SHERIFFS ARE ALLOWED TO

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.210
OVERSEE THE CAUSE OF DEATH

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.745
RULINGS. UNFORTUNATELY OUT OF

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:17.480

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.215
FAMILY OF ANGELO QUINTO WHO I

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.751

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.286
TRAGICALLY KILLED THEIR SON. IT

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.422
TOOK OVER SEVEN MONTHS AFTER HIS

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:28.791
DEATH. BUT THE CONTRA COSTA

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:31.728
COUNTER. CORNER TO ISSUE A

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.329
REPORT SEVEN MONTHS. AND THAT'S

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.098
WAS STATED THE REPORT WHICH

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.133
RULED HIS DEATH AN ACCIDENT AND

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.836
LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.270
EXCITED DELIRIUM. NOT A

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.972
PHYSICIAN I HAVE NEVER HEARD

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:44.540
THIS AS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:46.175
SO I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:48.878
ON WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS EXCITED

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.080

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:53.316
THAT HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.818
MEDICAL COMMUNITY. AND AS I WAS

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.987
REVIEWING SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS IT

01:00:58.054 --> 01:00:59.989
HAS SHOWN THAT EXCITED DELIRIUM

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.925
IS MOST OFTEN THE RESULT OF

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.261
POLICE AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.363
POLICE RESTRAINT. THAT'S WHEN IF

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.133
YOU. AND SO IF WE SEPARATE THE

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.934

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:15.471
TRANSPARENCY NOT ONLY FOR THIS

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.841
FAMILY BUT FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.076
HAVE HAD TO INDOOR THIS KIND OF

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.978
TRAGEDY. WE WILL NOT HAVE TO

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:23.913
WORRY ABOUT OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.114
AND IT ULTIMATELYGIVES THE

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.417
FAMILIES THE PEACE WHEN THEIR

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.018
LOVED ONE HAS PASSED AWAY. AND

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.654
