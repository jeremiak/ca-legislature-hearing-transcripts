GOOD MORNING WE'RE GOING TO STARTED. FIRST LOWER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT'S THE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WALKING THE STATE CAPITAL LET'S THINK ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY OBVIOUSLY. EVERY COMMITTEE IS MEETING THE BUILDING SO MOST MEMBERS ARE SOMEWHERE EITHER AUDIT COMMITTEE PRESENT A BILL ARE SINGLE COMMITTEE SO. THE BE FLOWING IN AND OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. LOTS LIKE THAT THE PRISONERS THERE AGREED TO SHARE THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ON THE ISSUE SURROUNDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS HEARING LOOKS FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT SERVE TO ENHANCE THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT. FIRST RESPONDERS IN A MILLION IS ABLE COMMUNITY. AND HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO PROMOTE THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS STATEWIDE. TOO OFTEN FIRST RESPONDERS ESPECIALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE DISPATCHED TO CALLS FOR SERVICE REQUIRE INTERACTION WITH THOSE MEN OF MIDDLE DISABILITIES. THESE CONTACTS CAN RANGE FROM A DISABLED PERSON OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS REQUESTING A LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE. FOR GENERAL ASSISTANCE TWO INCIDENTS IN WHICH THE MILIEU SAY BOTH IN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS MEMBERS ARE IN CRISIS. HIS TITLE CALLS INCLUDED QUEST IN WHICH MILLIONS ABLE PERSON THEIR FAMILY OR A BYSTANDER IS A WITNESS TO THE EVENT. A VICTIM OR AS IN MANY CASES THE FAMILY NEEDS HELP LOCATING A MISSING RELATIVE WITH MENTAL DISABILITY. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE NO IDEA WE PERSONS MIDDLE DISABILITY WHICH WAS THE OFFICER IN THE MILLIONS ABLE AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR A QUICK AND SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME. THESE INTERACTIONS POSITION OF CAN CHALLENGE TODAY'S PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES BECAUSE ADDITIONAL RESPONSE TO CALLS FOR SERVICE WITH MORE DISABLED PERSONS AT TIMES IS INEFFECTIVE. FIRST RESPONDER CONTACTS OF MILLIE DISABLED PERSONS ARE COMMONPLACE. THE SYSTEM THERE SOME ESTIMATES THAT UP TO THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION SUFFER SOMETIME TYPE OF MIDDLE DISABILITY. THE TO SIX SHOW THEIR POSSIBLY FIVE PERCENT OF US RESIDENTS HAVE A SERIOUS MENTAL DISABILITY AND MANY MORE HAVE NO DISABILITIES. THAT CAN AFFECT OUTCOMES BETWEEN FIRST RESPONDERS. IN THE PERSONS IN NEED. FURTHERMORE IS ESTIMATED THAT SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL PLEASE CONTACT IN JURISDICTIONS A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE PEOPLE INVOLVE INTERACTIONS. DISABLED PERSONS. A RECENT THREE CITY STUDY SHOWED NINETY PERCENT TO PERCENT PATROL OFFICERS HAVE AN AVERAGE OF SIX CONTACTS WITH A MILLION CIVIL PERSON EACH MONTH. THIS IS A LOT OF CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WE MUST FIND A WAY TO SURVIVE MILLION STABLE. POPULATION MUCH BETTER. WORLD'S WAYS FOR THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO KNOW THEY'RE RESPONDING TO A SITUATION THAT INVOLVES SOMEONE WITH MIL DISABILITY. TODAY YOU'LL SEE AND HEAR FROM SEVERAL PROGRAMS THEIR SUCCESSFUL IN DOING JUST THAT. THESE PROGRAMS GIVE FIRST RESPONDERS INVESTOR INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL WHO STRUGGLING WITH MELISSA BUILDING. AND MAYBE A CRISIS. IS A THIRTY YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT VETERAN I CAN TELL YOU THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION BEFORE THE OFFICER FIREFIGHTER RISE IS CRUCIAL IN PROVIDING SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES DURING CALLS FOR SERVICE. THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THE FIRST RESPONDERS THE INFORMATION AND TOOLS TO PUT A CALL THE NONTRADITIONAL RESPONSE. ME THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE MIDDLE IS ABLE. MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE'S THE CHEMICAL OPENING STATEMENTS SO I SPENT THIRTY YEARS AS A CAPTAIN OF THE SECOND WAS SHERIFF DEPARTMENT SO. READ A LOT OF MILLIONS ABLE FOLKS I WAS THE GEL COMMANDER FOR DOWNTOWN JONES. PRETTY SAD WHEN YOU'RE JAILS HAVE LARGER INPATIENT WARDS IN YOUR MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS SO SOMETHING WE TO CHANGE. ONE OF OUR KIDS FOR GOVERNOR. TALK ABOUT INSTITUTIONALIZING PEOPLE OF MIDDLE ILLNESS THAT'S NOT THE SOLUTION THAT'S OVER HERE THEY TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. AND WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE MUST DO BETTER SO I LOOK FOR HEARING FROM. GOTTEN DYNAMICS PRISONERS HERE TODAY SO. WE CALL WALK AWAY AND. AND MY COLLEAGUES GET HERE AND JOIN US. REALLY MAKE IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA NO MIDDLE HEALTH IS AN ISSUE. IT'S NOT SHOULD BE STIGMATIZED HAPPENS TO A LOT OF FOLKS. AND WHEN YOU DEAL WITH IT AND AND MAKE IT AS BEST AS WE CAN. ESPECIALLY THE INTERACTION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE SOMEONE. GET INJURED OR HURT AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD METHODS APPROVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING PRACTICE RIGHT NOW. THAT WE CAN. GETS INFORMATION ON HEALTH WE TAKE A STATE LIKE. SO GO AND START WITH OUR. FIRST PANEL ITS I COMMUNICATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECT THIS. FROM PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OUR PANEL ONE. ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. AND JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE CAN MORNING THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR. STAFF THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND AND WHAT IT. TIMELY WHAT OPPRESSION OPPRESSION MOMENT WE ARE IN TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL. AND IN A TIMELY OPPORTUNITY IN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'RE LEADERSHIP BRINGING YOUR BACKGROUND TO THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS YOU ARE ARE AWARE OF BETWEEN INTERACTIONS. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE DISABILITY BECAUSE WE AS YOU MENTIONED YOUR OPENING REMARKS WE IS CALIFORNIANS CAN DO BETTER. AT THAT INTERACTION. MY NAME IS JORDAN LENSING AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA THE RQ CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS REPRESENTING. PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE ARK IS ALSO A A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WITH CHAPTERS THROUGHOUT ALL OUR STATE AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT MANY OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY. BUT THE ARCS PRIORITY. HAS A THEIR EXPERTISE HAVE HAVE SHIFTED OVER THE YEARS IN AND. RECENTLY ONE OF OUR MAIN PRIORITIES HAS BEEN ON THIS EXACT ISSUE WHICH IS WHY. THE ARK DEVELOP THE NATIONAL CENTER ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND DISABILITY. AND OUR GOAL WITH THE CENTER IS TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO GAPS. AN EXISTING SERVICES FOR PEOPLE DISABILITIES. AND THIS IMMENSE IN CRITICAL NEED. AND THE THE GAP. IN WHAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND BETWEEN THE INTERACTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT DISABILITY HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME. BETWEEN IT IN THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY. AND IT TOOK SOME CATALYST THOUGH TO REALLY BRING THE NATIONAL. CENTER TO THE FOREFRONT AS A PRIORITY IN IN THOSE CATALYSTS ARE OR STORIES IN THEIR STORIES THAT TIME MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH. TRAGIC STORIES ON EVEN SAILOR YOUNG MAN WITH DOWN SYNDROME IN MARYLAND OR. WEST KLEINER A YOUNG MAN. WITH AUTISM IN FLORIDA CHARLES KINSEY DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL FOR YOUNG MEN IN FLORIDA. BUT. AS AS THOSE STORIES AND. WON'T WORK CATALYSTS FOR DEVELOPING THE NATIONAL CENTER ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND DISABILITY AND CATALYST. FOR THIS BECOMING A REAL PRIORITY IN THE FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. MY HOPE AND I THINK OUR HOPE IS NOT TO. DIVE INTO. STORIES OR TRAGEDIES AND SPECIAL NOT TO POINT FINGERS BUT OF COURSE RATHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS. SO THAT WE IS CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER AND MOVE FORWARD. SO I'M IN FINDING SOLUTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL CAN A START AT THE SAME PLACE AND WHAT I JUST WANT TO SHARE IS SOME. SOME STATS AND SOME INFORMATION AS A AS A STARTING PLACE FOR OUR DIALOGUE TODAY. AND DISABILITY WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE DISABILITIES OF COURSE THEY COME INTO A VARIETY. AND. A A PHYSICAL DISABILITY WHICH A A PERSON MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND OR LAY DOWN OR PUT THEIR HANDS UP. A PERSON WHO IS DEAF WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR COMMANDS GIVEN BY AN OFFICER. PERSON WAS BLIND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AN OFFICER. A PERSON HAS AUTISM WHOSE BEHAVIOR AND A HIGH STRESS. OR HIGH STIMULUS SITUATION MAY BE INTERPRETED AS NON COMPLIANCE OR EVASION OR EVEN AGGRESSION. A PERSON WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER. WHO MAY NOT HAVE ANY PHYSICAL APPEARANCES OF DISABILITY BUT MAY LACK MENTAL CAPACITY? TWO A FALL COMMANDS IN A CERTAIN SITUATION. A PERSON WITH EPILEPSY PERSON WITH DOWN SYNDROME. PERSON WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES THE THIS IS THERE IS A WIDE RANGE WHICH MAKES THE CHALLENGE. A DIFFICULT BUT A STARTING PLACE FOR US TO BEGIN. NOTING THAT THERE ARE IT ARE MANY DISABILITIES. AND. LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE ABILITY AND OPPORTUNITY. TO MEET THEM IN MANY PLACES. ALSO SOME STATS ACCORDING TO THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH. THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. SEVEN HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. EN THE NUMBER WILL DOUBLE DOUBLE IF YOU COUNT THOSE WHO MAY BE BLIND OR DEAF. AND ADDITIONAL STATS. WHICH CAN BE ALARMING BUT. UP IMPORTANT FOR US TO BEGIN WITH IS THAT IN GENERAL. PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL OR PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. OUR THIRTEEN PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO BE IT ARRESTED AS JUVENILES OR YOUNG ADULTS AND PEOPLE FREE OF DISABILITY. AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO REPORTING AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES. THAT CHANCE WIDENED BY SEVENTEEN PERCENT WITH MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF AFTER. AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT. SIMILARLY MORE THAN FORTY SIX PERCENT OF HISPANICS WITH DISABILITIES. TO BE ARRESTED AND COULD BE EXPECTED TO BE ARRESTED AS. A CHILD OR YOUNG ADULT. AS THE IS STATS AND THESE PRIORITIES HAVE GROWN. SO HAVE OUR INITIATIVES. IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND I AM EXCITED IS SURE YOU ARE AS WELL TO HEAR MANY OF THOSE TODAY. ONE THING THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IS. A PROGRAM THAT WE CALL PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE. AND PATH WHICH A JUSTICE WHICH YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT IS A FIELD TESTED CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND DISABILITY TRAINING PROGRAM. PILOTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT PROVIDES TRAINING TO THREE PRIMARY AUDIENCES LA ENFORCEMENT LEGAL PROFESSIONALS. AND VICTIMS SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. AND MORE THAN TRAINING AND DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TRAINING INITIATIVES PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE DOES NOT RELY ON TRAINING ALONE. BUT HELPS COMMUNITIES. AND STATES ADDRESS KEY BARRIERS TO JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND ABOUT TO DISABILITIES. AND DISCUSS PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS THAT WORK BEST FOR THEM. A TRAINED OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THROUGH PATHWAYS TO JUST PROGRAM. AND YOU'LL HEAR SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WAS HELD IN VENTURA AND IN THE SUCCESSES THAT HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THAT. SPECIFICALLY JUST TO CLOSE MISTER CHAIR. SOME POLICIES THAT WE. CONTINUE TO STRESS ON IN THIS DISCUSSION ARE THE FOLLOWING. AND ONE THAT SUPPORTING POLICY THAT ENHANCES TRAINING OBVIOUSLY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO FURTHER DOWN THE LINE FOR PROSECUTORS IN PUBLIC DEFENDERS. AND ALSO WANTS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A DISABILITY IS IS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE. POLICIES THAT ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO SENTENCING REDUCTION PROGRAMS WITH NEEDED ACCOMMODATIONS IN SUPPORT. POLICIES ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES GET THE NEED TO SUPPORT IF THEY ARE INCARCERATED. POLICIES THAT STRESS THE ALREADY EXISTING MANDATED REPORTING LAWS. AROUND DEPENDENT ADULTS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A BETTER SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP DISABILITIES AND ALL STAGES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'M EXCITED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOUNG QUESTION HIS HOUSE THE PATHWAY FOR JUSTICE FOUNDED FROM I'M SORRY FUNDED FUNDED. VARIOUS GRANDSON THROUGH FEDERAL DOJ. AND SOME THROUGH GRANTS ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE NATIONAL THE WHOLE NATIONAL CENTER ON PROMOTE JUSTICE AND DISABILITY FUNDED THROUGH ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT MAJOR GRANTS AT OUR NATIONAL OFFICE IN DC. I'M SOME OF IT THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDING HOWEVER AND DOWN I THINK OUR NEXT PICK PILLS LEGAL SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO. THE PROGRAM NOW AND I WAS HELD A MENTOR. BUT I CAN FIND OUT EXACTLY WHICH. FUNDING SOURCES ARE FOR PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE IF YOU LIKE EMIGRATE AND YOU WORK WITH POSTED ALL. IN CALIFORNIA WE DO YES AND IN POST THERE IS A. A TWO HOUR. TELL COURSE WHICH ARE ON DEPENDENT ELDERLY DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE WHICH IS AN EFFECTIVE TO OUR TELE COURSE HOWEVER. FROM WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE IT CHANGE FROM MANDATORY TO VOLUNTARY. AND. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IS TO. CREATE MORE MANDATORY TRAINING IN THIS AREA. RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THANK YOU. I'M A BIGGER APARTMENT SOBRE SPEAKERS. THE ARK VENTURA COUNTY PETTY SHOWS EXECUTOR ACTOR FOR PATHWAYS JUSTICE INITIATIVE. AND ALSO BRUCE WILSON CO. OF. IF I NEED HELP DOT ORG. GOOD MORNING MORNINGS. AND YOU GUYS. SOME COMMERCIALS ALL. OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. MORNING I AM PATTY SHOWS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARC OF INTER COUNTY. WE SUPPORT SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. ANDY IS A YOUNG MAN EMERALD IN OUR TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM. ONE MORNING HE WAS DRIVING FROM HIS APARTMENT TO A STATE PROGRAM. AND WAS IN A MINOR CAR ACCIDENT. AND EMPLOYEE HAPPEN TO BE PASSING BY ON HER WAY TO WORK AND SAW THE INTERACTION AND I KNEW IT WAS NOT GOING WELL BETWEEN AND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE STOPPED AND WAS ABLE TO INTERVENE BEFORE ANYTHING WAS ESCALATED. AND HE HAS AUTISM WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE OFFICER WAS NOT RESPONDING TO INSTRUCTIONS. AND THE OFFICER THOUGHT AND HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. THIS IS AN UNCOMMON IT'S REPORTED THAT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY HAVE LITTLE OR NO OBVIOUS INDICATION. WHICH MAKES RECOGNITION DIFFICULT. LAST YEAR I CHAPTER HOSTED SIXTY LONG FOR CEMENT LEGAL PROFESSIONALS. AND. VICTIM SERVICES PROFESSIONALS AT A PROGRAM. CALLED PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE. PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE IS A ONE DAY TRAINING. AND. THE PURPOSE IS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND RECOGNITION OF INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND A FORMER STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND DISABILITY PROFESSIONALS. WE THINK WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT ENDEAVOR. ATTENDEES LEARNED ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY TYPES OF BEHAVIOR LANGUAGE IN PROCESSING. THEY WERE ARMED WITH FACT SHEETS AND TIP CARDS TWO. REMIND THEM OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IF THEY COME ACROSS SOMEONE. OF JUST A SIMPLE THINGS LIKE AS A PERSON SENSITIVE TO SOUND OR LIGHTS ARE THEY AVOIDING EYE CONTACT. AND TO COMMUNICATE MORE CLEARLY TO INTRODUCE SOME SOLACE CALMLY AND QUIETLY. AND TO USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE AND GIVE AMPLE TIME FOR RESPONSE. UP PEOPLE WITH IT INTERVIEWS WITH IT DE UM ARE ONE TO THREE PERCENT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THEY REPRESENT BETWEEN FOUR AND TEN PERCENT OF THE PRISON POPULATION IT WAS WAS I DID YOU STAND FOR BUT INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AN ESTIMATED SEVENTY PERCENT OF YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND MOST IN A MINOR OFFENSES. ONE AND SIXTY EIGHT CHILDREN ARE BEING DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. A SURVEY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM AND THEIR FAMILIES INDICATED THAT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF A CRIME. TWENTY THREE PERCENT HAD BEEN. IN INTERACTIONS WITH FIRST RESPONDERS DUE TO WANDERING OR ELOPING. AND THREE PERCENT REPORTED BEING COERCED TO COMMIT OR PARTICIPATE IN A CRIME. FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME IS A SPECTRUM OF CONDITIONS THAT CAN OCCUR TO A FETUS WHEN A MOTHER DRINKS ALCOHOL WHEN SHE IS PREGNANT. HIS LIFELONG WITH NO CURE. AND IT'S A HIGHER PERCENT PREVENTABLE. THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME HAVE BEEN IN JAIL OR PRISON AT SOME POINT. SIXTY PERCENT HAVE A HISTORY OF TROUBLE WITH THE LAW. AND THE AVERAGE AGE AT WHICH A CHILD WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SUSTRANS. SYNDROME BEGINS A HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE LAW IS TWELVE YEARS OLD. VENTURA COUNTY OFFICERS RECEIVE SOME TRAINING IN IT DE AND THERE CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING. BUT THEY FOUND THAT THE IN DEPTH PATHWAYS TRAINING WAS INVALUABLE. THEY TOLD US ABOUT AN APT THEY USE CALLED ICON UP WHICH IS A SECURED OF A SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON AND I THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE SOME OF WHAT THEY LEARNED. AT PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY A PERSON WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY SOONER. THEY ALSO LEARNED THAT THEY HAD A PARTNER IN THE ARK. WE HAVE PROGRAMS AND. VIRTUALLY EVERY COMMUNITY IN VENTURA COUNTY AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN CALL US ANYTIME. WE WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER. BEING LED BY THE VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THAT. PRO THAT THE ENDEAVOR IS UNDER WAY AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO EMPLOYEES SERVING ON THAT WORK GROUP. PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL. AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE LIVING AND THRIVING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THERE VOLUNTEERING IN PARTICIPATING AND WORKING AND WORSHIPPING WITH ALL OF US SIDE BY SIDE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR HOPE IS THAT AWARENESS AND EDUCATION MAY CHANGE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER WILSON. CHECK IT OUT PASS THIS UP TO YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY. WE'LL HAVE THE HEALTH CODE TO GET FOR YOU. MAYBE PASSED. I. AMBRUS WILSON FROM IF I NEED HELP AND I'M A. PRETTY PROACTIVE AUTISM DAD AND MY WIFE AN I HAVE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON NAMED JAY. AND HE'S REALLY IMPROVING TREMENDOUSLY WITH I'M THERAPY HE HAS AUTISM. AND HE STILL IS. WANDERING RISK BECAUSE EVEN A FEE AND IF HE GETS OUT HE WON'T BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF. AND HE COULD BE MISINTERPRETED AS SOMEONE ON DRUGS OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND SO MY WIFE AND I CREATED A SAFETY NET AND WE HAVE SIXTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES AND PROBABLY EVEN. SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT OUR MEMBERS OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND WE MAKE WEARABLE ID. SEE IF THIS IS OUR. YEAH DOT AND WE MAKE WEARABLE ID WHICH I PASSED SOME EXAMPLES AROUND. I AM AND I WE HAVE AS A CARE GIVER CONTROLLED SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY. AND. SO IN OUR EXPERIENCE. I SAFETY FOR PEOPLE WITH AUTISM EPILEPSY IS A THREE WAY STE THREE. HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU HAVE FAMILIES WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND CARE GIVERS AND YOU HAVE THE GENERAL COMMUNITY. AND IF THERE'S A WAY FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A PERSON THAT HAS SPECIAL NEEDS WHEN THEY'RE MISSING OR CAN'T COMMUNICATE IN A CRITICAL SITUATION. AND IT REALLY PUTS PEOPLE ON THERIGHT PAGE AND GET PEOPLE HOME SAFELY. AND SO WE HAVE ABOUT AN A SIXTY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS OF WEARABLE ID BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS DIFFERENT SENSORY NEEDS. AND MY SON FOR INSTANCE IF HE GETS AWAY FROM HIS CAREGIVER. AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY HE NEEDS HELP. SO HE HAS A PATCH ON EVERY SHIRT. AND SO I THAT WOULD HELP ON YOU KNOW PEOPLE KNOW THAT HE'S A PERSON WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IT ALSO WOULD HELP BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SECONDS TO MAKE A DECISION AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I ON WHAT TO DO ABOUT A SITUATION. SO IF THEY SEE SOME SORT OF VAN I'VE YOU KNOW ID ON SOMEONE SOMETHING THAT THAT MAKES THEM THINK ONE THAT MAYBE THIS IS A PERSON THAT HAS SPECIAL NEEDS. AND WHILE PROTECTING THEMSELVES BECAUSE OFFICER SAFETY IS FIRST PRIORITY. THEY COULD. PERHAPS APPROACH SITUATION IN A MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE WAY IN AND CREATE MORE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. AND SO WE AND ALSO A LOT OF ARE SAFE AYE SUCCESS STORIES HAPPENED ON BEFORE IT GETS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHEN A KID GOES MISSING IN A WALMART OR AND OR ON THE STREET. A COMMUNITY MEMBERS A FINING PEOPLE AND AND THEY'RE SCANNING OUR PRODUCTS AND GETTING HOME WITHOUT POLICING BEING CALLED. AND. SEE HOW DID I MAKE THAT SLIGO THERE WE GO. AND WE ALSO HAVE. A SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY THAT'S CARE GIVER CONTROLLED AND THERE'S THREE PARTS TO IT THE FIRST PART IS. I'M A PUBLIC PROFILE SO IF YOU SCAN ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND YOU WOULD SEE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE EXACTLY WHAT THAT PARENT OR CAREGIVER ONCE YOU TO SEE TO HELP THEIR CHILD AND GET THEM HOME. AND MOST OF OUR STUFF ALSO HAS A TELEPHONE NUMBER AND STUFF ON IT SO THEY CAN BE CALLED DIRECTLY. THERE'S ALSO AN EMERGENCY QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION ON WHICH IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT AN OFFICER WOULD ASK INTO A CRITICAL MISSING. AND SO THIS CAN BE FILLED OUT IN REAL ITS ACT BEFOREHAND AND DOWN IMPRINTED IN KEPT IN A PERSON'S PURSE OR EMAILED IN AN EMERGENCY. SO THAT. IF BOND IF THEY'RE LEVEL OR MISSING AYE THE INSTEAD OF LIKE. STILL NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THEY COULD HAND THE OFFICER THE INFORMATION AND THEY KNOW HEIGHT WEIGHT AND HOW TO HELP PEOPLE AND STUFF LIKE THAT. WE ALSO THE THIRD PART TO OUR I CAN GIVE A CONTROL REGISTRY WHICH IS A NEIGHBOR ALERT. WHICH IS LIKE A FLYER THAT YOU COULD PRINT OUT IN ADVANCE AND GO TO YOUR NEIGHBORS. AND SAY HERE'S MY SON OR DAUGHTER AND THEY HAVE ON YOU SPECIAL NEEDS IF YOU SEE HIM ON THE STREET. AND THIS IS HOW YOU CAN INTERACT WITH THEM AND PLEASE CALL US HERE'S A TELEPHONE NUMBER. BUT THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THE REGISTER RIGHT THERE. HERE'S THE HELLO NEIGHBOR ALERT. AND EVERYTHING'S UPDATABLE IN REAL TIME. AND I WOULD TRY TO MAKE THINGS INCREDIBLY EASY FOR PARENTS SO THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF IS JUST SET IT AND FORGET IT. I THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE THAT DO SIMILAR THINGS AND AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD BECAUSE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD CORNER THE MARKET IN THIS TYPE OF THING SO THE PARENTS UPDATED OR DOES THE ORGANIZATION UPDATED IN THE PARENT STILL OKAY AND WE HAVE. WE'RE WORKING WITH VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT ROUND THE COUNTRY JUST ARE WORKING WITH ON THE NEW YORK CITY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND WHERE MAKING. A BIG ORDER FOR THEM WITH THEIR LOCAL LINE AND STUFF LIKE THAT SO I JUST MISSION WHETHER IT STATEWIDE MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM. AND WE WE AND TRAIN FOURTEEN HUNDRED CHP OFFICERS AND LAST YEAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I END WHERE A VENDOR AND WITH THE INLAND REGIONAL CENTER AND I AND. SEEMED PRETTY NEATO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES AND AND THEY'VE BEEN SHARING OUR INFORMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE. AND SO WERE MAKING SOME STRIDES. AND SO I. I ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS THINKING WHEN I WAS DOING THAT I TRAIN WITH MY WIFE ERIN WHO'S. BASICALLY OUT OF IRAN SHE'S THE BRAINS ON THE TECHNICAL GUY. SHE CAN SHE COMES UP WITH ALL THE PRODUCTS I AND IT MAKES ALL THE CONTACTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING OF THE SIEGE P. I WAS THINKING. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING SO MANY THINGS ABOUT. EACH PERSON WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IS DIFFERENT SO WHAT WORKS WITH ONE. WON'T WORK ON ANOTHER ONE MIGHT WORK WITH ANOTHER. AND YOU KNOW SO WE'RE SAYING YOU DO THIS AND THIS AND THIS EXCEPT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. AND SO WHAT WOULD I DO FOR THAT AND I WAS THINKING. AND IF I WERE AN OFFICER AND I WOULD GET PERMISSION IT TO GOING UNIFORM TO PLACES WHERE THERE ARE SPENT BEFORE SPECIAL NEEDS. SCHOOLS AND GROUP HOMES SPECIAL OLYMPICS AYE THERAPY SESSIONS SO THAT I COULD SEE HOW PEOPLE THAT ARE AROUND PROVIDERS INTERACT WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND SO THAT IF I SEE SOMEONE IN THE STREET I I MIGHT THINK WELL THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS GUY SAW THAT TIME IN THEIR THERAPIST SAID. IN A BRIEF. BREED WITH ME YOU KNOW READ MY LIPS OR OR YOU KNOW IS IT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. AND LAID OUT AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE SOME TOOLS AND ALSO THE PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IF THEY WERE USED TO SEEING. OUR OFFICERS IN UNIFORM COME TO THEIR SCHOOLS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY LIVE. IF THEY WERE MISSING DATE MIGHT TEND TO GO TO A POLICEMAN IF THEY SEE IF THEY'RE LOST I'M LOST I NEED TO GO TO A POLICEMAN. AND WHEN THEY SEE A POLICEMAN THERE WOULD THINK WOW THIS IS A FRIEND THIS IS SOMEBODY I CAN TRUST BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS NOW. AND TOO MANY TIMES IS THAT. PEOPLE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THINK THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS A STRANGER BECAUSE MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T MET. MANY POLICE OFFICERS AND SO WHEN THE AND WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY LAST AND THEY COULD BE HIDING. AND SO IF THEY ON AND THEIR VINCENT YOUNG DEATHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AS A RESULT SO IF I SPECIAL NEEDS PERSON FIVE. POLICE TO MY FRIENDS AND IF A. IF AN OFFICER AND HAD A LOT A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE I JUST BEING AROUND PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND IT COULD BE A LOT OF. INC YEAH EASY AYE EASY POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND DOWN PEOPLE THAT AREN'T. TRAUMATIZED AND DIE GOOD STORIES AND AND. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE AN EASY WAY TO GET GOOD RESULTS. I GUESS THAT'S IT. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT'S GREAT I WAS NO WHERE YOUR PROGRAM IT'S. I LIKE IT HOW THANK YOU LIKE WE ALSO HAVE A THING THAT WHERE I'M TALKING TO THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ABOUT. AND THAT I WAS TALKING TO AND I SENATOR WILKS OFFICE AND I WAS ARE SENATOR. AND I THAT IT'S IT'S ALL TOO EARLY TO REALLY GET INTO THE DETAILS BUT IT COULD BE S.. I STATEWIDE MISSING PERSONS DATA BASE THAT ON. AYE EVERYBODY MIGHT BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH SO AND I HOPE I'M NOT JUMPING THE GUN TOO MUCH BY SAYING THAT MUCH BUT IT'S IN THE WORKS GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU COVERING FOR NEXT SPEAKER IS. COULD BE AFTER THE* EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. AFTER UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY. AND SERGEANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS. BUT MR ZERO. TYPICALLY UPS MEMBERS PLEASE. THANK YOU. MORNING THE MORNING AND SO I AM ASTRAZENECA AT THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS ASKING LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY. AND ON BEHALF OF MY UNION AND MY SON MYSELF. I LIKE TO THINK EVERYONE WHO IS PARTICIPATING TODAY. ESPECIALLY CHAIRMAN COOPER. AND THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WILL HOPEFULLY BE HER SOME TO HEAR THE REST. AND IS THIS IS BY NEARLY A TWO YEAR LONG. JOURNEY FOR ME. TO BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. WITH THAT SAID THOUGH THAT MAY GIVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHAT WHAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY. SO. UW REPRESENTS OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CAREGIVERS WHO PROVIDE FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AND. I AM ONE OF THOSE CARE GIVERS ASK. I CARE FOR MY OWN ADULT SON WHO IS. AUTISM AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY HIS NAME IS MANUAL. AND A. MANUAL IS AT THAT SEVERE AND OF THE SPECTRUM. WHICH COMES WITH A MULTITUDE OF DELAYS. ABILITIES AND DISABILITIES. HI HEAR IS NON VERBAL A VERY VOCAL AND I HE IS PRONE TO AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS. I DOESN'T FOLLOW VERBAL COMMANDS HE HAS NO FEAR OF WATER HEIGHTS CARS. AND AND YOU WANDER OFF AND AND IF UNSUPERVISED SO IT HAS HAPPENED. UNFORTUNATELY. BUT THAT'S JUST A PART OF WHO MANUAL IS. HE LOVES MUSIC I ESPECIALLY NOR JONES AND BEETHOVEN. AND HE LOVES HIS TABLET HE LIKES TO WATCH. DOOR THE EXPLORER. BLUE'S CLUES DISNEY MOVIES. AND HE'S VERY CHILDLIKE. BUT HE LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE STRENGTH OF A YOUNG MAN. AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS COMBINATION UNFORTUNATELY. FOR HIM LIKE ALL HUMANS. WHO WE REACTS WITH A FIGHT OR FLIGHT INSTINCT? ESPECIALLY FILLED IF YOU FEEL FRIGHTENED OR ENDANGERING YOU ARE UNKNOWN TO WHAT'S COMING ACTUAL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I HAVE ALWAYS WORRIED. ABOUT HOW LONG FOR SENATE AND OFFICERS ARE ANY FIRST RESPONDER FOR THAT MUCH WOULD REACT TO HIM AND HIS BEHAVIORS. AND. THERE ARE SOME VERY REAL SCENARIOS OF HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN HE COULD WANDER FROM HIS DAY GREW. SOMEONE TO FEEL THREATENED BECAUSE OF HIS SIZE AND HIS BEHAVIORS ARE HIS ACTIONS AND MAYBE CALL THE POLICE. OR HE COULD HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. IN THOSE CASES MANY WOULD BE AT THE MERCY OF WHATEVER TRAINING OR LACK OF TRAINING. THAT A FIRST RESPONDER MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD. WOULD DEALING WITH PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OR MENTAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL FOR ANY CASE. I AM. BUT FIRST OR FOREMOST I'M A MOM. SO AND I HAVE SEEN TOO MANY STORIES TO SIT BY AND I ONLY WISH. AND FOR MY SON TO BECOME ANOTHER STATISTIC AND. MY FELLOW UAW MEMBERS FEEL THE SAME WAY AND MANY OF OUR CLIENTS SUFFER FROM DISABILITIES FROM ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA TO PTSD SCHIZOPHRENIA. AUTISM CEREBRAL PALSY YOU NAME IT. AND THEY'RE WIDELY MISUNDERSTOOD. THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE ACTIONS OR LACK OF ACTIONS MAY BE INTERPRETED AS BEING DEFIANT HER DRUG INDUCED. WHERE AND WHEN FACT IT'S PART OF THEIR DISABILITY OR MAYBE LACK OF MEDICATION THAT THEY SHOULD BE ON? I'M IN THIS IS WHY WITH THE SUPPORT OF MY UNION I HAVE SET OUT TO FIND. PART OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE OUR. LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF. AND DEPARTMENTS THAT NO THAT THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY TO EDUCATE TRAIN. UP FIRST RESPONDERS AND NO. WE CAN CREATE BETTER ALERT SYSTEMS AND TOOLS TO PROTECT VULNERABLE MET MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH SENATOR BILLS OFFICE ON SB ELEVEN SP TWENTY NINE. BE MANDATED TRAINING AND BILLS WHICH I BELIEVE WILL GET A UPDATE ON LATER ON THIS HAVE. THIS MORNING. ON THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE PARTNERED WITH SENATOR GALGIANI IS OFFICE ON THIRTEEN THIRTY WHICH WAS THE BILL THAT CREATED THE INCLUSION OF THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. TO BE CONSIDERED AT RISK WHEN NEED BE ON THE LOOK OUT SCHOOL OUT. AND IN THAT SAME YEAR SENATOR GALGIANI ALSO CARRIED A YEAR ARE RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER AS SILVER LURKED AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND AWARENESS MONTH. THIS WAS NECESSARY AS MOST PEOPLE HAD NO CLUE WHAT A SILVER LAKE IS. OR THAT IT IS EVEN BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL ADULTS WITH SOME SORT OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT I'M I BELIEVE WE'LL BE HEARING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT LATER ON TODAY AS WELL. MOST RECENTLY WE WORKED WITH I ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IS OFFICE ON A BEFORE THIRTY SEVEN. WHICH WAS TO CREATE A STATE WIDE. DATABASE. VOLUNTARY DATABASE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES I'M THE AIM OF AB PRO FOR THIRTY SEVEN WAS TO PRO ACTIVELY PROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION AS THE. IF I NEED HELP PROGRAM DOES. AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WITH THE INTENT TO EXPAND IT TO ALL FIRST RESPONDERS. I AM THE MAIN FOCUS WAS TO POSITIVELY ENHANCE THESE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW AND THE COMMUNITY. ON THIS BILL BECAME A TWO YEAR BILL. AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARE RESEARCH IN OUR CONVERSATIONS FOUND SEVERAL OTHER STATES WHO HAVE INTRODUCED SIMILAR LEGISLATION. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY MUNICIPALITIES AND DISABILITY ORGANIZATIONS HERE AND STATE CALIFORNIA. ALREADY ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS ON A LOCAL LEVEL. SO IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THE MOST. MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE PLAN WOULD BE TO EXPAND THESE EFFORTS INTO ONE STATE WIDE COHESIVE PROGRAM. THAT WAY WHEN YOU ARE SOMEONE ELSE TRAVELS WITH YOUR LOVED ONE THE INFORMATION YOU INITIALLY PROVIDING YOUR OWN LOCALITY. WOULD BE AVAILABLE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE. IF I PROVIDE MY SON MANUALS INFORMATION MODESTO WHERE I LIVE. AND WE TAKE A TRIP TO DISNEY LAND OR SEA WORLD AND HE GOES MISSING. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. NOT JUST IN HIS OWN AREA BUT ACROSS THE STATE. I'M IT WOULD ACCEPT EXPEDITE THE RESPONSE TIME AND POSSIBLY SAVE MY SON'S LIFE. AS IT IS NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONVEYING INFORMATION ON MANUALS FALLS INTO ME. HIS MOTHER. WHO WOULD UNDERSTANDABLY HE FRANTIC TRYING TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING? AND. LET ME JUST SAY. TELL YOU I INDIVIDUALS LIKE MY SON CAN'T WAIT FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO COLLECT INFORMATION BEFORE AN ALERT IS ISSUED OR THE BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ISSUED. MY SON CAN BE DROWNING IN A POOL OR A RIVER IN A MATTER OF MINUTES BECAUSE HE HAS NO FEAR THAT WATER. ASSEMBLY WHERE I'M MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND I DECIDED TO PULL AB FOR THIRTY SEVEN. I'M SO I'M NOT GIVING UP AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES. AND. NOW THAT THESE ISSUES ARE OUT THERE THE MANY CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO HAPPEN. THEM AND TODAY YOU'LL HEAR THE STEPS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OTHERS FIRST RESPONDERS THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIKE MY SON MANUAL. AND THEMSELVES RIGHT THEY GET TO GO HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES OUR LOVED ONES GET TO GO HOME TO WHEREVER THAT HOMEY DE. I'M MY HOPE IS THAT AFTER TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE READY TO START THINKING ABOUT. THE VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE OFTEN. ON HEARD AND HOW WE CAN REACH OUT TO THEM. AND I HOPE WE WILL WALK AWAY FROM TODAY READY TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND DO THE WORK NECESSARY. ON WITH THAT I I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COOPER. AND YOUR OFFICE FOR HAVING AN OPEN DOOR AND LISTENING TO ME. AND SEEING THE NEED FOR THIS CONVERSATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM TO MAKING THIS HAPPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AT THE FIRST OF ALL PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP ON A BEFORE THIRTY SEVEN. OBVIOUSLY IT WOULDN'T COME TO TO YOUR BILL THERE'S SOME RESISTANCE SOMEWHERE SO THAT AMONGST THE MIDDLE HEALTH FOLKS THEMSELVES ARE. NOW ACTUALLY I'M MONEY. YEAH VERY THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE THE DEVIL'S. KEY TO EVERYTHING IS AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST HOW WOULD IT BE IMPLEMENTED HOW WOULD IT BE ADMINISTERED WHO WOULD DO THE ADMINISTRATION OF IT. I'M I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS MY ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WAS FOR THE DOJ TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE MAYBE ONE OF THEIR DATA BASES THAT THEY ALREADY HAD. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONVERSATION AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH DOJ. AND. THERE THAT WAS THEIR CONCERN IS THEY COULDN'T FATHOM HOW THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER OR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED. ARM AND THEN AND THAT'S WHEN WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD MAKE IT TO YOUR BILL THAT WAS LAST SUMMER. AND AND THEN I WENT ON MY RESEARCH AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE AL DORADO COUNTY SHERIFF'S WEB ON AUTISM REGISTRY SANTA CLARITA. WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM OUT ROLES ON SAN DIEGO WHO HAVE THESE THINGS IN PLACE AND WE CAN TAKE BEST PRACTICES FROM AND LEARN FROM? I FOUND SEVERAL. FEDERAL DOJ GRANTS DAD. ADDRESSED EIGHTEEN BASED PROGRAMS WERE ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. SO THERE THERE'S WAYS TO DO IT WE JUST REALLY HAVE TO COME TOGETHER TO PUT OUR. THINKING CAPS ON AND AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN TOGETHER SISTER YOU KNOW WE DID INVITE THE CALIFORNIA PARTNER JUSTICE TO COME AND TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY. OF A. STATEWIDE DATABASE NAY REFUSED. SO IT VERY INTERESTING. SO THANK YOU THINK IT VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. OUR NEXT SPEAKERS ARE LYNN BOWLER DIVISION MANAGER SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. STUFF ABOUT BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN SAN DIEGO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TECHNICAL PROGRAM REGISTRY. LIEUTENANT MIKE NOT. HOPEFULY I SAID YOUR NAME RIGHT MIKE. THEN BUTCHER IT. AND GOOD MORNING TO HAVE MY NAME IS LYNN BULLARD THE SUPPORT SERVICES MANAGER AT THE OAK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT MEANS I HAVE I'M COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY AUTHORITY OVER THE DISPATCH NINE ONE ONE CENTER FOR THAT AGENCY. I'M I'M HERE TO TALK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT A PROGRAM CALLED SMART NINE ONE ONE THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AT THE OAK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT HIT IS. A TOOL THAT ARE CERTAINLY A BENEFIT TO THE INTELLECTUAL COGNITIVELY CHALLENGED COMMUNITY BUT IT IS A PROGRAM. THAT WE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE HOW TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT IT IS A REGISTRATION TOOL. THIS PROACTIVE IT ALLOWS SAID THE CITIZENRY TO DEVELOP A. SMART NINE ONE OE PROFILE HE AND THEY DO SO. VOLUNTARILY. THIS SMART NIGHT ON ONE PROFILE ALLOWS MEDICAL FIRE. INFORMATION THAT A CITIZEN AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. THE DISPATCH CENTER KNOW ABOUT IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY AND THE SOLE GOAL HERE IS TO TAKE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT TO RESPONDING UNITS REAL TIME. SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE RESPONSE. AND US STRATEGIC DECISIONS WHILE THEY'RE IN ROUTE TO EMERGENCY. SO. THE CITIZEN CAN PROVIDE AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH INFORMATION AS DESIRED ANOTHER VALUE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS THAT IT'S PORTABLE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE REGISTRATION INFORMATION IS ENTERED INTO A NATIONAL DATABASE? SO FOR ANY COMMUNITY THAT HOW SMART NINE ONE ONE IF I FOR EXAMPLE GO ON VACATION TO BOSTON. AND I CALL NINE ONE ONE FROM MY CELL PHONE MY NINE ONE ONE SMART NINE ONE ONE. PROFILE WILL DISPLAY IN THAT DISPATCH CENTERS A NINE ONE ONE CENTER. SO NOW THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE DEEMED VALUABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL FOLLOW ME WHEREVER I GO. AND THAT THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY CAN NOW USE THAT INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT THAT IS INVALUABLE. UP TO THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO INVALUABLE FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP AND POPULATION. YOU CAN PUT PHOTOGRAPHS INTO SMART NINE ON WINE AND THE INFORMATION IS INSTANTANEOUS. SO AM I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW AT SMALLER SHORT. AT A NEWS CLIP FROM ELK GROVE PT WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED SMART NINE ONE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS WELL. ASSISTANT DEMONSTRATING. HOW THE PRODUCT ISSUES? YEAH. WHAT IS? A FIRST RESPONDER TIME DAYS. ROAD USERS WITH YOUR CHILD SHOWS IT'S WORKING. THEN. PREPARE FOR YOU IN AN EMERGENCY. CANCER. NINE ONE ONE CALLS. THIS MESSAGE. SAVE GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION FROM. YOU. WHERE IS? THE LOCATION. NINE ONE ONE. HER OR NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH. DO WE CALL ONE ONE WERE ABLE TO SEE ALLOCATED FOR THE SAKE OF. OKAY XIN. YOU WANT. DO YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY MATTERS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. GET QUEUE HERE AND BETTER KNOWN. EMERGING. RESIDENTS SAY THAT INFORMATION. SO IT'S RANTINGS OF. NO. WITH ME NOW. A MISSING PERSON. QUICKLY ACCESS. AND REDUCE THE TIME. OVERCROWDING. GETTING. THE NORTH. MASON. WE ARE. NO LEGAL OUR. SO THAT'S A MEDICAL CONDITION. THE RACIAL. TRANSFER OVER. YOU KNOW CALL. SURE THE INFORMATION TECHNICAL INTERVIEWS WITH. DURING AT. THOSE YOU. SO AM I WANTED TO TAKE AS. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND THE INITIAL CALL THE CAN. SO I'M JUST AS OUR BY NATURE A BIT CHAOTIC THERE'S A LOT OF INFO. I MEAN VERY QUICKLY THERE'S A LOT OF I AM CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT ARE GOING ON. DEBT HOW WE TALK WORK FLOW A LOT WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET THE INFORMATION AND HOW WE MAKE IT MEANINGFUL TO. TWO PATROL OFFICERS RESPONDED IN THE FIELD BUT FROM A CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE THIS IS THEIR WORST DAY EVER. THEY ARE ENCOUNTERING A SITUATION THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE MAGNITUDE OF AND AND THEY MAY NOT IT. KILLER TIME BUT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY IN AN EMERGENCY PERIOD BUT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT AND PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE. FOR THOSE THAT HAVE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES I'M INDOSAT YOU ASIANS WE MAY CREATE A CALL FOR SERVICE AND THEN THAT POLICE OFFICER IS GOING INTO THAT AB SITUATION IN THE BLIND. I AM NOT A POLICE OFFICER I AM THE COMMUNICATIONS PROFESSIONAL BUT I CERTAINLY CAN'T IMAGINE GOING INTO A CALL FOR SERVICE WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO MAKE A DECISION. SO WITH SMART NINE ONE ONE AS YOU SAW ON THE VIDEO THE INFORMATION THAT I AM FROM THE PROFILE IS DISPLAYED ON THAT DISPATCHERS NINE ONE ONE SCREEN AND IT IS DONE SO INSTANTLY AND AUTOMATICALLY. SO THERE'S NO NEEDFOR A DISPATCHER TO QUERY ANY OTHER SYSTEM SUCH AS A STATE DATABASE IT DISPLAYS IMMEDIATELY AND WE KNOW THAT THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN VALIDATED WITHIN THE LAST SIX MONTHS SO WE KNOW THAT THE INFORMATION IS ACCURATE. IF WE CAN CONTRAST THAT WITH AN OFFICER GOING INTO A CALL IN THE BLIND. AND THIS ALLOWS THE DISPATCHER TO MAKE MORE ACCURATE DISPATCH DECISIONS THEY CAN TAILOR THEIR QUESTIONS AND THEN DETERMINE APPROPRIATE DEPLOYMENT BASED ON THAT INFORMATION. WE ARE ABLE TO SEND THE RIGHT NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO THE RIGHT PLACE. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPOND TO THAT CALL CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS THEY KNOW THAT THERE IS PERHAPS AN INDIVIDUAL THERE THAT DAY YOU WILL NEED TO RESPOND OR ADDRESS IN A CERTAIN WAY. AND IT PROVIDES THAT. AGAIN ABILITY TO. TO STRATEGIZE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT CALL. WITH INCREASE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THEY'RE ABLE. TO RESPOND MORE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY AND LESSENING THE RISK FOR ALL. SO I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT A REAL LIFE SITUATION WHERE THIS HAS BEEN USED IN THAT'S IN ADDISON ILLINOIS. AT THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY INVOLVED IN NINE ONE ONE HANG UP CALL SOMETHING THAT WE GET DAILY HOURLY. IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. THE PROTOCOL FOR MOST CENTERS IS TO ATTEMPT TO CALL BACK BUT FREQUENTLY WERE NOT ABLE TO MAKE CONTACT. IN THIS SITUATION. AT THE RESIDENT HAD A SMART NINE ONE ONE PROFILE IN THAT SMART NINE ONE ONE PROFILING IDENTIFIED. THAT SHE HAD AN ADULT SON WHO LIVED AT THE HOME WITH HER HE AB WAS ARTISTIC AND HE HAD A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. RESOURCES RESPONDED TO THAT ADDRESS KNOWING THAT THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER AN INDIVIDUAL COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT TO DISABILITIES WHO MAY BE VIOLENT. OBVIOUSLY DOT PROVIDED A VALUABLE MIND SET FOR THEM RESPONDING I DON'T KNOW IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE CALL THAT JUST KNOWING THAT TO RESPOND IS. PRICELESS DYEABLE INFORMATION SO. AS I'VE IDENTIFIED. ELK GROVE HAS BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT TIME I'M CERTAINLY A FAN OF IT BUT WE HAVE HAD SOME CHALLENGES. AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE A SINGLE AGENCY USER WITHIN A LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SO ELK GROVE THE CITY ABOUT PROBE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND POPULATION NOW IT'S LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN END OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND WE ARE LITERALLY AND I WENT INTO OF OURSELVES BECAUSE OF BASS. SO WHEN WE'D DO. PROACTIVE REGISTRATION AND CAMPAIGNS AND TALK TO PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING TO APPROVE CITIZENS AND ITS OAK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE GOING OUT THERE AND ENCOURAGING US VOLUNTARY REGISTRATIONS. SO WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE THE. ABILITY TOLEVERAGE A LARGER AREA AND THEREFORE ARE AYE REGISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN. CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTING AND WE HAVE DIED AT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF. OF OUTREACH AND TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE SO THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO CHALLENGER CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE BY. BUT TO COUNTER THAT THERE ARE LARGE REGIONAL DEPLOYMENTS IN THE COUNTRY FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE STATES OF ARKANSAS DELAWARE IN MICHIGAN HAVE ALL DEPLOYED SMART NINE ONE ONE. ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE IN THE CASE OF MICHIGAN AND THEY HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION THAT DID A STUDY THAT ACTUALLY CHOSE SMART NINE ONE ONE TO TOOL OF SMART I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPLOYED. STATEWIDE AND THEY HAVE THEY HAVE DONE SO. ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THEIR AGENCIES ARE NOW DEPLOYED A CLOSER TO HOME IN KERN COUNTY THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT EFFORT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. DAY RECENTLY ENTERED INTO A FIVE YEAR GRANT AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT DAY HAD A MUCH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS THAT INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS. WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES THAT AT THE END OF AN INCIDENT THEY HAD A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF. THE INCARCERATED OR HOSPITALIZED. AND WHAT THEY DID WAS BEGAN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT INVOLVES ALL POLICE DEPARTMENT SHERIFF FIRED NINE ONE ONE CENTERS. AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND THEY BEGAN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT I TO DEPLOY SMART NINE ONE ONE AND TO USE THAT REGISTRY COMPONENT. BUT THE PROGRAM ALSO HAS A TRAINING AND EDUCATION TOOL AND IT PROVIDES A NEW SHIP MENTAL HEALTH FOCUS THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE. IT THERE. PROGRAMS STATES CLEARLY THAT THEY ANTICIPATE AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR GRANT. THERE TO BE FEWER PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ERECT AND ARREST DUE TO THEIR REGISTRY DATA. AND ANOTHER COLLABORATIVE COMPONENT OF THIS IS THAT DAY RECOGNIZED THAT VOLUNTARY REGISTRATION IS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. AND THEREFORE THEY HAVE. CREATED SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS IN ORDER TO. Q. OPTION IT DOESN'T HAVE A BETTER SUCCESS IN THIS AREA FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE INCLUDED HOSPITALS IN THE REGISTRATION PROCESS SO THAT WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED OUR IN OUR HOSPITAL THEY CAN AND COMPLETE A REGISTRATION AFTER SMART NINE ONE ONE AT THAT TIME. SO. ENCLOSING I'M AN ABSOLUTE FAN OF THIS PROJECT PRODUCT IN TOOL I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL. VALUE TO ANY CITIZEN IN ANY COMMUNITY BUT CERTAINLY. CERTAINLY THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND I ALSO WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AND TO DISCUSS THIS VERY VALUABLE A TOOL AND TOPIC WITH YOU TODAY. THINK USE ANYBODY OUTSIDE OF GROW TRIED TO USE THE OF GROWTH NINE ONE ONE. I WON SYSTEM CHRIS ARE AS FAR AS THE. THE. SMART NINE ONE ONE USING WOULD ALSO THE CITY TRIED TO USE THEIR SIGN UP FOR IT. OTSIDE THE CITY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS CHEST SO IF THEY WORK IN THE CITY OF ALL GROWN BUT THEY SIDE AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE SOME VALUE WITHOUT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE COMING INTO ITS GEOGRAPHIC BASED. SO WHEN THEY CALL NINE ONE ONE IT WOULD COME INTO OUR CENTER BUT IF IT GOES INTO ANOTHER CENTER THEY DON'T HAVE NINE ONE ONE THERE ARE SMART NINE. THEREFORE THAT DATA WILL NOT DISPLAY. SO. SMART I DON'T MIND ISSUES PREDOMINATELY ON THE EAST COAST AND MIDWEST AND IT'S KIND OF SLOWLY WORKING ITS WAY TO THE TO THE WEST COAST AT THIS POINT I HOPE IT WILL BE AS POPULAR HERE. THANK YOU. NOW BEFORE COLOR NEXT PHILIP ALONE AGES MY COLLEAGUES MOVING JIM FRAZIER COLLECTED SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY IS THE BIGGEST CHAMPION. OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS COMMUNITY AND SPECIAL EFFECTS HE'S BEEN INVOLVED FOR YEARS AND. HAS BEEN THAT YOU MISS ADVOCATE SO MUCH MAKING COMMENTS MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. AND I GUESS I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH AND THANK YOU FOR. YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY ó AND LAW ENFORCEMENT I NO LONGER SEE IS A VERY CARING. ORGANIZATION AND I THINK THAT ANYTIME WE CAN HEIGHTEN AWARENESS ON HOW. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT BOTH IN EACH IN EACH FACET. OF THE WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE AND AND. DEPART THE PROCESS OF SUPPORT AND. TRAINING OR WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT OF THE OFFICERS ARE SAFE AND SOLVES THE DD COMMUNITY. SO I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS OF THIS IS DONE UNPRECEDENTED I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. YOU. THOUGHT. I'M ALSO GONNA CULP LE A KEPT ROBERT LOUIS THIS TIME ALSO AFTER THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CYNICALLY STATION ME I THINK YOU. FOR HAVING ME HERE MY NAME IS MICHAEL CANNOT VEHEMENTLY TENET WAS SENT YOU COUNTY SHERIFF. ON THE HAVE SHARE OF GORE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. COME SPEAK WITH YOU ARE ON A SYSTEM OF PROGRAM THAT YOU WE RUN IN SAN DIEGO THAT'S ALL OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY IT'S REGIONALIZED OUT THEIR IT'S CALLED TAKE ME HOME. I THINK IT'S FASCINATING TO SIT HERE AND LISTEN TO ALL THE SPEAKERS NOT ONLY TO HEAR NEW THINGS THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THAT ARE TRULY OUT THERE. BUT LISTEN TO PEOPLE THAT SPEAK WITH PASSION LIKE ASTRID IN AND CONNECTING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND I THINK MISTER FRASER JUST SAID IT'S. CORRECTLY IS THAT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY SAFETY FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. BUT ON BEHALF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE RESPONDING THOSE TYPES BECAUSE IT GIVES IN THAT. CRITICAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KINDA HELP THEM MAKE A GOOD JUDGEMENT WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVE ON SCENE. WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT A BRAIN HAREBRAINED HERE IT IS THE INDIVIDUAL THAT BROUGHT ME HOME TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ON HIMSELF WAS OF POWER MORE POLICE OFFICER AND HE WAS RETIRED HE IS THE FATHER OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM WHO IS ON THE LOWER END OF THE SPECTRUM. IS RESPOND TO THESE TYPES OF CALLS WHILE WHILE WORKING IN THE FIELD. I'VE MET WITH BRIAN BRIAN AND I HAVE GOING TO PRESENT TO TAKE ME HOME TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF. OF THE COMMUNITIES AND TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS HE SPEAKS VERY PASSIONATELY. HE KNOWS FROM A FIRST RESPONDER STANDPOINT. WHAT WE FACE AND WHAT WE LOOK LOOK LOOK AT AND I THINK ASTRID MENTIONED THE RESPONDING TO THE? THAT'S CHILD THAT HADN'T GONE LOST IN AND TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHAT ARE WHAT ARE WHAT IS OUR RESPONSE POLICY WHEN WE GET ON SCENE WE ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS IN WE. WE TRY TO GET A PHOTOGRAPH WE SEARCH THE HOUSE IN THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND HE IS ALSO ONE THAT I'LL TELL YOU THAT TIME IS CRITICAL TO A TO A CHILD WHO HAS NO FEAR. A CHILD WHO HAS NO FEAR OF DARKNESS A CHILD WHO HAS NO FEAR OF WATER YOU'RE GONNA TAKE TIME TO PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND THAT'S JUST NOT IT SO. HE ACTUALLY HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CHILD GONE MISSING. AND BEING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED HE FELT. THAT. IN HIS WORDS HE SAID I'LL BE HERE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH MY CHILD MY CHILD I WILL RAISE MY CHILD. IF I CAN'T BE HERE WHEN HE NEEDS ME THE MOST I WANT TO KNOW THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT ILL WILL SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS OR SOMEBODY WHO ADMITS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN HIS LITTLE BRIAN'S WORLD BECAUSE A LITTLE BRIAN. I WANT SOMEBODY TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT'S WHY HE CAME OUT WITH THIS REGISTRY LIKE TO SHOW YOU A QUICK VIDEO. REAL QUICK THAT WE PUT OUT IN THE COUNTY. YEAH. YEAH. RIGHT HERE BEHAVIORS. LITTLE LIGHT HAIRED THE IMMENSELY COST A LITTLE THE SAILORS. HELLO IN THIS PARTICULAR THREE HUNDRED. EVEN BAG APPEARED ON WITH HAVING YOUR. I LOVE. SEVEN EIGHT NINE. YOU KNOW THE PHONE OUT OF THE WORLD. SMARTER THAN. WE ARE. LET LEGAL. I ACTIVATED HERE A I DON'T WANT TO PLAY BOTH WORK. WELL. THAT'S CERTAINLY A ARE. LEGAL MIND. MARK. IS A VERY. BUT AS. WITH MY WIFE. THINK ABOUT IT WE REALIZED. IT WAS REALLY AND OFFERED HIM DONALD THE FLORIDA CAN OF THE MEANS YOU KNOW I WAS A VERY. SO THIS YEAR. NBAE. THE VERSION I REGISTRY. MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO FIRST RESPONDERS OR MEDIA NEEDS. IN THIS REGISTRY HOLDS OUR MEDICAL CONDITION SPECIAL CARE INSTRUCTIONS A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON AND A PHOTO. AND CURRENTLY. WE'RE WORKING THROUGH. ARE PROCESS RIGHT NOW IS AS WITH PHOTO RECOGNITION SO WE CONTACT SOMEBODY IN THE FIELD THEY'RE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES WE'RE WORKING WITH PHOTO RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO COME BACK AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT PERSON. IT'S CURLY SOMETHING OUR SYSTEM HAS KEY CAPABILITIES OF DOING. OUR REGISTRATION PROCESS BACK WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WE HAD CARE GIVERS. HAD TO GO TO ONE OF ARE STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS ARE TO A STATION TO REGISTER. ON ANOTHER PROJECT I'M HEAVILY INVOLVED IN ALZHEIMER'S SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAS A HUGE PUSH RIGHT NOW FOR ALZHEIMER'S LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE ALZHEIMER'S. AND AS PART OF THAT IN TALKING THE CARE GIVERS WHAT I LEARNED WAS IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO FILL OUT A SIX PAGE FORM THEN GO DOWN YOUR STATION AND SIT WITH SOMEBODY AND WALK OVER IT. AND DO IT. SO I WENT TO OF THE SHERIFF AND I ASKED HIM IF IT WAS POSSIBLE WE CAN DO ONLINE REGISTRATION AND. HE FEELS TO PRIORITY TO CONNECT WITH OUR COMMUNITY HE PRIORITIZE WITH AN ORGANIZATION IN OUR DATA SERVICES GUY. INDIVIDUALS QUICKLY PUT TOGETHER ONLINE REGISTRATION SO NOW YOU CAN LOG IN ONLINE YOUR IPHONE YOUR ANDROID DEVICE IN YOU CAN FILL OUT AN APPLICATION RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN STILL GO TO A STATION. TO REGISTER IF IF NEED BE WE PREFER EVERYBODY REGISTER ONLINE THAT WEIGHTS ATTACHED YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD THE SYSTEM IS ACCESSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY AND IT'S A COUNTY WIDE PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE TO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT. I JUST FINISHED. HOME OR RECENTLY THIS YEAR I JUST FINISHED UP PROBABLY A TWO YEAR TOUR OF EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE ALL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME DATABASE IT'S CALLED ES DE LA. AND THROUGH THAT ES DE LAWS WHERE THE REGISTRY FOR TAKE ME HOME IS HOSTED. SO WE ALL HAVE ACCESS TO IT SO AS A REGION WET WEATHER IN THE CITY OF THE MESA THE CITY OF CHULA VISTA CORONADO SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE ALL HAVE THIS INFORMATION. HOW MANY CITIES OF JUST PUTTING ALL THE CITIES IN THE COUNTY ARE MOST? SO. AT THAT CITIES ARE WE HAVE ALL OF THEM ONBOARD RIGHT NOW WE JUST FINISHED WAS SENDING A P. WHICH IS THE SECOND LARGEST. AND WE HAVE LIKE HARPER PT SOME OF THE SMALLER AGENCIES WHETHER BE SOME OF THAT THE. FLAT CASINO. TRIED POLICE SINCE THE BIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT ON BOARD YET BUT WE HAVE ALL THE MAJOR CITIES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ON NOW EDUCATED ON THE SYSTEM AND WHAT IT IS. SO HOW IT WORKS. AN AND THIS HAS TO GO WITH US WE ALL SHARE THE SAME DATABASE WHEN YOU REGISTER ONLINE IT GOES TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND CRIME PREVENTION SPECIALIST REVIEWS THAT INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY AND THEN THE INPUT IT. AND WHAT THAT INFORMATION DOES IT THEN GOES INTO SD LAW. AND THEY SEND US EMAILS BACK WITH SOME CRITICAL INFORMATION AND A PHOTOGRAPH AND WE ATTACH IT TO OUR CAD SYSTEM OUR CAD SYSTEMS COMPUTER AUTOMATED DISPATCH. THE CARS NOWADAYS ARE ALL COMPUTERS LA LAPTOPS IPHONES. ON SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT CALL FOR HELP BEGETS FLAG IN OUR SYSTEM AS THAT INDIVIDUALS AND TAKE ME HOME IT BECOMES A PRIORITY. AND THEN OUR DISPATCHES ALLOWED IT SENDS IT OUT TO THE VEHICLE AND IT HAS CRITICAL INFORMATION THAT GOES OUT TO THAT VEHICLE IN DC. THAT INFORMATION THAT THAT DEPUTY NEEDS TO KNOW IS IS RESPONDING AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SNAPSHOT HERE. IT CONTAINS DEMOGRAPHICS A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION A DIAGNOSTIC AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ALSO THAT PHOTOGRAPH. AND AS I SPOKE OF EARLIER IF WE MAKE A FIELD CONTACT WITH YOU IF WE JUST COME UPON YOU IN THE FIELD. WHERE IT THAT SEEM DATABASES SEARCHABLE THROUGH THE DISPATCH CENTER WITH NUMEROUS INFORMATION HAIL MATS ONE TWO THREE ANYTIME DRIVE CAN YOU TELL ME? WITHIN THIS RADIUS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REGISTERED TAKE ME HOME I HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL HERE HE SAYS HIS NAME IS THERE SO IT SEARCHABLE THAT WAY. AND ALSO THROUGH THAT VOTER RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. SO WHAT TO GET OUT OF THE CAR APOLOGIZE SMALL ON THE SCREEN BUT IT COMES OUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS THIS IS AN ACTUAL SNAPSHOT OF THE VEHICLE. ON THE SCREEN IN A VEHICLE AND IT WILL GIVE THE SPECIAL NEEDS INDIVIDUAL. AND TO TELL THE DEPUTY WHAT HERE SHE LOOKS LIKE THE NAME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND ALSO AS YOU SEE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FEAR OF DOGS HUGS NOISE SENSITIVE RUN TENNESSEE OR WATER ATTRACTED. AND THEN AUTOMATICALLY GIVES IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IF IF ONE. IS ATTACHED. SO OUR PROJECT BENEFITS OF COURSE OF THE SAFEGUARD THOSE WHO NEED EXTRA CARE. ON SPEEDY RETURN OF OUR LOS CLIENTES SPEEDY RETURN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE FIELD AND IT'S ALSO REGIONAL ACCESS RIGHT NOW BY ALL AGENCIES. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR SYSTEM. AND THAT'S AWESOME. WHOSE AUTHORITY REGISTRY PERSON LEGALLY. BUT IT SO IT WOULD BE THAT THAT CARE GIVER WE'VE AYE IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE HIPPER CONCERNS IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY THROUGH THE CARE GIVER THAT HAS CONSERVING SHIP OVER THE INDIVIDUAL. OKAY IN THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT SOMEONE'S ENTRY AND SYSTEM. AND WHO MAY NOT WANT TO BE IN IT. WE HAVEN'T RUN INTO ANY ISSUES WITH SOMEBODY IN A SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO BE AND IT. AND AYE MAGIC IF THAT WAS THE CASE THEN WE WE COULD REMOVE THEM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LEARNING AS WEAK AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IS WHAT YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM IN YOU MOVE HOW DO WE UPDATE THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POSITIVES PROS AND CONS WHAT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN NOW IS? IF THAT PERSON MOVES OR HOW DO WE UPDATE THAT INDIVIDUAL A HOW DO WE GET A MORE RECENT PHOTO SO THIS IS THIS IS A FAIRLY NEW THESE ARE SOME OF THINGS WERE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW TO TO LEARN TO WORK THROUGH. HAVE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY USE THE FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM AT ALL OR. BUT I I KNOW IT'S BEING USED IN THE FILM. THERE ARE SOME GLITCHES IN THAT SYSTEM ON AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TAKE AWAYS FROM OUR OUR SYSTEM IS WHEN WE WERE ASKING PEOPLE FOR A PHOTOGRAPH THEY WOULD. SEND US A PICTURE OF THEIR MOTHER IN HER FAVOR LAZY BOY CHAIR WILL BY THE TIME THAT GETS OUT OF THE VEHICLE IT'S NON USABLE. SO WE'VE ACTUALLY. HAD TO CREATE AN IN OUR ONLINE REGISTRATION WE DESCRIBE WHAT'S LIKE A PASSPORT PHOTO SWEETIE LIES THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S STRICTLY AUDIENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LEASE FACIAL RECOGNITION A LOT TAKE SOMEONE'S COMMITTED A ROBIN A BANKER. USED A CREDIT CARD THE STORE THEY HAVE GOOD CAMERA STE YOU JUST TAKE THAT PHOTO AND RUN IT. THROUGH AN OLD PERSON SYSTEM AND AND MATCH IT'S I MEAN LAWS THINGS WE USE A LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE IS THE CRIMINAL SIDE CAN BE APPLE. ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE DD COMMUNITY EVERYBODY ELSE ASSIST. SISTER HOW TO HOW TO MASH YEAH MISTER FRAZIER QUESTIONS. AMAZING SYSTEM THANK YOU OF WHAT'S NEXT STEPS BECAUSE I MEAN HE BELIEVES START ON THIS QUEST SO. WE STARTED TWENTY TEN AND. I WAS I WAS PULLED INTO A COMMAND MEAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT USUALLY COORDINATOR FOR SAN DIEGO AND I HAD SEARCH AND RESCUE TO REGIONAL ASSET. AND I WAS GIVEN THIS PROJECT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND I WAS I WAS TOLD BY COMMAND WE ALL KNOW HOW THIS GOES THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THIS FOR THE REST YOUR LIFE SO. I'VE KINDA HELD ONTO IT. LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE SYSTEM I THINK INITIALLY WE INTRODUCE STATE WE WE BLEW IT OUT THERE AND THEN WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION. SO IT'S A REAL COMMUNICATION TOOL YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE WE NEED TO MAKE RELATIONSHIPS SO I'VE GONE BACK THROUGH WITH ALL OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REINTRODUCE IT. WE ACTUALLY ARE STARTING WE RE INTRODUCING IT TO OUR OWN DEPARTMENT EVERY COUPLE YEARS YOU KNOW WHAT TURN OVER NEW DEPUTIES AND STUFF WE TELL THEM WHAT IT IS A. ARE YOU AWARE THIS THIS IS WHAT IT IS WHERE DO WE GO NEXT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE. CURRENTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. THE PHOTO RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO WHAT'S A BIG THING IS THAT TIMELINESS OF OF HOW CAN I GET YOU TO DO AN ANNUAL UPDATE. CAN MY. ONLINE REGISTRATION AUTOMATICALLY KICK IT BACK ALSO SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE'VE DONE IN SAN DIEGO THAT CAME OUT OF THE ALZHEIMER'S PROJECT BUT IT'S ALSO WITH MISSING KIDS AT RISK AS WE HAVE A LOOK SAN DIEGO. WHICH IS A COUNTY WIDE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION WILDFIRES THAT WE HAVE IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A THINK THERE'S OVER THREE OR THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WELL WE WENT THROUGH AND WE MODIFIED THAT TO TO BE ABLE TO USE IT IF A MISSING CHILD WHO'S AT RISK AN AUTISTIC CHILD GOES MISSING. WERE ALLOWED TO USE IT FROM THE FIELD SO IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE MISSING FROM AN ADDRESS I CAN DO ONE MILE RADIUS AND IF YOU'RE IN THAT ONE MILE RADIUS I CAN ALERT YOUR PHONE WITH A PHOTOGRAPH I CAN SEND YOU A TEXT AND AN EMAIL. AND I SAID YOU TOUCH THROUGH EMAIL WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH THE INDIVIDUAL IS MISSING WHAT HIS NAME IS AND WHO TO CONTACT. THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE WE DO WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND WE CONTINUE TO GROW. WITH MORE THINGS COMING BUT FOR TAKE ME HOME RIGHT NOW I THINK JUST TO REALLY GET US PASSIONATELY WORKLOAD ONE GAP THAT I'M UNABLE TO EXPLAIN. IS. WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE REGISTERED AND I SPEAK TO PEOPLE ALL OVER. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW. WHERE THAT GAP IS TO GET MORE MORE PEOPLE REGISTERED I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT REGISTRY GROW OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S TO SUCH A BENEFIT IN SUCH A GREAT COMMUNICATION TOOL FOR US TO REACH OUT TO MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION? SO THAT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TRIED TO ASK ABOUT SOME CARE GIVERS WHAT WHAT WE MISSING BECAUSE WILL DO A FAIR WILL DO AN EVENT AND WE'LL GET A FEW PEOPLE SIGNED UP. BUT ALL SPEAK TO THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW AFTER. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE HAD BUT TO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH FIVE OTHER PEOPLE AND THEN AFTER WE START REALLY TAKING A LOOK AT IT PUSHING IT OUT. WE WENT UP TO TWO THOUSAND SO HOW DO WE CONTINUE THAT SO. THAT'S WE'RE GOING THE PROGRAM HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO KEEP IT UPDATED AND ACCURATE. AND SO HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SIGN UP IT'S VOLUNTARY ACCESS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY. BUT HOW DO WE GET THAT WHERE'S THAT MISSING PIECE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS KEPT IN THE LUIS FROM I. REALLY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. SO. SURE COOPER NEVER ANY THANK YOU FOR A HAVING ALL THIS YEAR TODAY YOU I'M. FRAZIER STAND UP WHEN I PRESENT SO SITTING DOWN ALL THE MOVING AROUND A LITTLE BIT SO.

SO OF THE SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY IN TWO THOUSAND. BACK IT UP. SO SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY. AS A FREE SAFE TOOL FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO USE ITS PRODUCT OF WAY FOR US IS LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. TO INTERACT WITH THE THE COMMUNITY IN THOSE ARE IN CRISIS.

ACCOMMODATE THE PERSON'S US SPECIAL NEEDS. THE SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY FOR SENATE CREE INTO THOSE LEVIN OF WAS AWARDED BY THE CALIFORNIA. ENERGY. SHE'S EMERGENCY SERVICES ASSOCIATION AND ALSO. BY FEMA. HELP FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATE. AS THE OTHER UP PROGRAMS YOU'VE HEARD TO CREATE A SECURE ACCOUNT ONLINE. OCCUR THE PROFILE DETAILED INFORMATION INCLUDING A A PHOTO THEY CAN PROVIDE. PROGRAM IS NOW UPDATED ON A YEARLY BASIS SO WE MAKE SURE AND WE ENSURE THAT WE RECEIVE IN NEW FOUGHT EVERY YEAR. TO UPDATE OF THE PROGRAM. TIMES. DILAPIDATED. AYE BUT IT'S AN A CHRISTIE'S XIN FOR OVER THE COURSE MY THREE THREE YEARS. OUT MY THIRTY THREE YEARS ABOUT TWELVE THEM OF THE YEARS OF MY CAREER FROM DEPUTY TO. LIEUTENANT AND NOW CAPTAIN. SO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE PHOTO WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP DID. THE CAREGIVERS FUSS BILLY IS TO RECEIVING CARRY A SPECIALIZED REGISTRY ID CARD. KEEP INFORMATION UP TO DATE AND ADVISED UP THESE AND I DON'T OPERATOR OF HE PERSON'S SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY. OTHER W. SO LONG GONE INTO THE SYSTEM LIKE ISN'T SECURITY POINT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONCE IDENTIFY PERSONS FOUND. THE INFORMATION IS CREATED INSTANTLY AND IT PROVIDES ACTUALLY A MISSING PERSONS FLYER PRINTS ON MISSING PERSON FLYER. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MOBILE DON'T DIGITAL COMPUTERS IN THE FIELD. FOR THE COURSE OF THE PAST EIGHT NINE YEARS OF THE FLYERS CAN BE GENERATED BY A SUPERVISOR IN THE FIELD. AND THEN THE SUPERVISOR TO PRINT UP IN THE FIELD FOR DEBBIE'S TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE COMMUNITY OF PERSONS MISSING. IT'S. INTERNET BASED IT'S A A SECURE LOG AND LIKE I SAID ARMS MOVE THROUGH A COUPLE THE SLIDES. A QUICK. THE KIND OF SHOWS YOU OF WHAT THE DEPUTY SEE WHEN THE COME UP OVER THE PROGRAM. ON THE COMPUTER AND ON THE MOBILE DIGITAL COMPUTER. PERSONS FOUND ALL THE IN THE REGISTRY SO. IF WE FIND A PERSON WE CAN LOG IN AND SEARCH TO FIND OUT THE PERSON IS IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY.

USUAL LOCATIONS AGO TOO PEOPLE IDENTIFY OF SO SEIZE US HOURS IN TIME. ESPECIALLY CRITICAL DURING MISSING PERSON. PICTURE IT CREATES THE A MISSING PERSONS FLYER. QUICKLY IDENTIFIES A PERSON TO BE ABLE TO REUNITE THEM. DEPUTIES LIKE USEFUL INFORMATION THAT IS VERY AYE USER FRIENDLY. ACCOMMODATE IN IRAQ TO EFFECTIVELY IS CD COMPLIANT. SICK WE HAVE SOME SUCCESS STORIES. AUTOMATED OF REMINDERS UPDATE EVERY TWO YEARS WE HAVE REDUCED IT DOWN TO ONE YEAR. SO. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. I REINTRODUCE IT NOW WE REDUCED TO ONE YEAR SO THE REMINDERS THAT YOU KNOW OUT TO THE PARTICIPANT. AS THAT WE'RE JUST AUTOMATICALLY EVERY YEAR IT SENDS NAME OFF THE PRODUCE MINNOW UNDERSTAND IT'S AN AGREED WE HAVE AREAS THAT OF. A LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS. THERE ARE LOCAL LIBRARIES ETCETERA THAT. WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS TO GO AND MEET ONCE A YEAR WE PUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH A NO COME DOWN TO THE LIBRARY. RE REGISTER YOUR. YOUR LOVED ONE WE SEND OUT A LETTER TO THE HOUSE. SO THE CONCERT THERE ARE FEW CONS TO IT AND THAT IS THAT THE THE SOME OF THE OFFICERS OF THE ROUTE TRAIN DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT. SO THAT'S ALL THE THE LITTLE INSULAR THINGS THAT I DEAL WITH AS A MINISTER'S YOU KNOW. PEOPLE HERE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT WE'RE TRYING TO THE INFORMATION OUT NOW WITH THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA OUR LOCAL. PAPERS ARE ON BOARD WITH GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT WE REALLY START TO PUSH US IN THE BACK AS CAPTAIN FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. RELEASED ARE THE PUSH ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO. THAT'S MY SECOND SECOND I HAVE MY FIRST YEAR BENCHMARK DRANK OF THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING BACK OUT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE UTILIZED. AT THE GROUND OUT ON A TERRIFIC PATH. WE NEED TO KEEP THE INFORMATION UP TO DATE THAT'S AWESOME BECAUSE IS TRYING TO REACH OUT AND GET EVERYONE. SO. PROS OUTWEIGH THE CONS IT SAVES LIVES IS PROACTIVE. POTENTIAL FOR LINKING OF REGISTRY JUST OVER LURKED FUND CRITICAL MISSING. ESPECIALLY DURING. DROWNING ANOTHER. DANGERS. SO THE CITY SENATE FREDA IS THE ONE WHO SPONSORS THE PROGRAM TO SEE SANTA CRUZ OPEN SHARING THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS PROGRAM% TECHNOLOGY AT NO CHARGE. SO. THEN THE ISLAND DOES PICTURE HERE SHE IS THE ONE THE START OF THE PROGRAM WITH ME BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WITH THE DEPUTIES. HER IN ON JUDGE WE MANAGE THE PROGRAM. THEY MANAGE IT. THEY VOLUNTEER RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET THEM A. YEARLY STIPEND TO HELP MANAGE THE PROGRAM TO MAINTAIN IT. I GATHER ALL THE INFORMATION AND I WILL GO OVER THE LAST SLIDE BECAUSE IN THE PUT IN A PICTURE OF ME AND I'M STAND IN FRONT OF SO. THAT. SO. SO I'M THE SPEAK A LITTLE BIT. THROWN FROM THE HEART WE HAVE FLYERS OF THE PROOF PROVIDE TO THE DEPUTIES ON THE FIELD IT'S BOTH IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH. THE DEPUTY PROVIDE THE FUEL THE PRIOR PROVIDED TO THE RESIDENTS TO BE ABLE TO LOG ON TO REGISTER. SO FROM THE CUP FROM FROM THE HEART. BEFORE I CAME TO SANTA CRUZ STATION. I WAS ASSIGNED TO ADVANCE OFFICER TRAINING. CRAWL FOR A PERIOD OF A YEAR AND A HALF. ON BEHALF ASSURE FUDGE MCDONNELL. I KNOW THAT. AND WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT S. B. TWENTY NINE S. B. ELEVEN. SO WHEN ASTRID MISSION THAT I CAN OF KEY TO ME. S. BETWEEN S. B. ELEVEN I WAS PART OF THE INITIAL. START UP ON OUR DEPARTMENT FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING. THE DEVELOPED PERSON RICH COUNTRY PROGRAMS THREE TWO HOURS FOR THE CANCERS DEPARTMENT. I KNOW THAT THE. STATE HAS DIFFERENT AS SOME REQUIREMENTS BUT OUR REQUIREMENT IS THIRTY TWO. AND WE RECENTLY RECEIVED OUR A CERTIFICATION TRIPLES FOR A THIRTY TWO HOURS. AND HERE'S WHERE WHERE I COME INTO PLAY THE SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY NOT ONLY. SHOULD DEAL WITH. AUTISM ALZHEIMER'S BY POOR ISSUED YOU ACROSS THE GAMUT WE KNOW THAT ACROSS THE NATION. THE PRESIDENT'S IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS AN OPIATE OVERDOSE EPIDEMIC. SPECIALTIES REGISTRY WE'RE GOING TO BE. SEGUEING INTO ALLOWING PEOPLE PARENTS YOU HAVE KIDS THAT ARE DRUG ADDICTED TO HAVE DRUG DEPENDENCIES TO BE ABLE TO LOG ON TO THE SYSTEM. WHO PUT DOWN THAT THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER WILL BECOME A CONTACT WITH THEM? HOUSE THAT SPECIAL NEED AS WELL BECAUSE NOT ONLY SPECIAL NEEDS OF OF. IT'S SPECIAL NEEDS ACROSS THE BOARD AND BUT THAT'S WHAT CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING DEALS WITH. THE THIRD CHARGE REALLY IDENTIFIES. FOR DEPUTIES ON OUR DEPARTMENT ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THOSE CRISIS. THE SPECIAL NEEDS REGISTRY CLOSES THE GAP AND CLOSES THE CIRCLE BECAUSE THE DEPUTIES WE CAN TRAIN THEM ALL WE WANT I CAN TRAIN MY DEPUTIES FOR THIRTY TWO HOURS ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE ARE IN CRISIS THOSE ARE ARE DEALING WITH DRUG ADDICTION. BUT WHAT WE WILL BE DON'T CLOSE FOR THEM IS THE OTHER HALF IT AND HOW TO IDENTIFY THEM IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS REALLY KIND OF CLOSES THE GAP. SO ON BEHALF THE SHERIFF AND. ONE THINK. DOING. AND. S. R. ASTRID. PREV ME UP HERE TODAY BOB HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WITH FRAZIER. SO YOU GOT THIS PROGRAMS INTENT WHO'S BEEN THERE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE TWO THOUSAND THREE WAS DEVELOPED BY DEPUTIES MYSELF IF YOU'RE THE DEPUTIES WE CAME IN CONTACT WITH SOME MISSING KIDS IN THE IN THE FIELD. AS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DEAL WITH. TEARS AND I HAVE SEVERAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. PARTNERS THAT I WORK WITH. HAT HAVE A SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE AUTISM. AND WHEN YOU TOUCH ME ON THE SHOULDER HE CREATES A DIFFERENT REACTION IF YOU TOUCH ON THE BACK OF CHRISTOPHER ACTUALLY RELIES ON TWO THOUSAND THREE AND ONE TO. CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE WE COULD PUT THE INFORMATION IN THERE TO DEPUTY. THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE. TOM THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED BUT I HAVE. EVERY YEAR FROM THE CITY OF SAN AGREED UP. WE'RE GONNA BE UPDATING IT. AND THE OTHER SET FORTH. OF BUT THE PROGRAM FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE PROGRAM DID. THIS IS STRICTLY ONLY FOR SENATE CAREER WE HAVEN'T. REACH ACROSS TO OTHER. STATIONS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT OR LAPD THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUT PERCENT AGREE SENATE CREUS CAP SLATED IN THE VALLEY ITSELF INTO A RIGHT THREE THOUSAND RESIDENCES IS TREMENDOUS YOU CURRENTLY WE HAVE ABOUT. ELEVEN HUNDRED AND VISUAL CENTER REGISTRY. SO AS FAR AS A TRAINING SPOKE ABOUT THE THIRTY TWO HOUR THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING FOR A THAT DEPARTMENT WIDE. THIS YEAR'S DEPARTMENT VERY TO OUR CHRISTIAN IMAGERY WAS. INTRODUCED BY SHERMAN DONALD LEFT THE PROGRAM TOGETHER OF. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO HOURS CRESCENT WRENCH TRAINING DEPARTMENT WIDE CAREER. CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF OUR PATROL PERSONNEL TRAINED AND SO THE AUDIENCE KNOWS THAT IS OPTIONAL TRAINING THAT IS NOT MANDATED TRAINING. THAT THEY CHOSE TO DO CORRECT. IT IS OPTIONAL TRAINING BUT IS IT'S OPTIONAL TRAIN BUT IT'S MANDATED BY SHARPER TAL EVERYONE THROUGH OUR IN OUR DEPARTMENT CHAU GO THROUGH BUT STATEWIDE INHALED TEA IS WHAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS EVERY TWO YEARS IS A FORTY HOURS I CAN'T MEMBERS. IT IS. TWENTY FOUR HOURSEVERY TWO YEARS FOR CONTINUAL PROFESSIONAL TRAINING CPT TRAINING OUR COURSE INTERVENTION TRAINING ITSELF. IT WORD A CRITICAL POINT NOW I BELIEVE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE DEBBIE'S NEED YOU TO RECEIVE IT. SERVER DOLLARS ON THIS IMPRESSION AND OR WERE TRAINING ALL OF OUR PATROL PERSONNEL. COURSE INTERVENTION TRAINERS ALSO A THIRD YOU ARE CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING FOR JAIL PERSONNEL WHICHIS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM IN THE JAIL OUR POPULATION THEY HAVE ALREADY TRAINED CLOSE TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE DEPUTIES IN IN THE JAIL SWIVEL SPEAKER COMING UP VIA TALK ABOUT TRAINING STATEWIDE THAT'S THAT'S A. BIG ISSUE BECAUSE YOU FIGURE EVERY LOT FOR SAYING SEE OUR LOVE FOR SLAUGHTER. GO THROUGH TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS TWENTY FOUR HOURS MAY HAVE CERTAIN MANDATED TRAINING SO IT'S IT'S LA IS DOING SOMETHING UNIQUE. WHERE IS WHEN YOU'RE IN TRAINING OVER FOLKS OFFICER YOU GOT BACK FILL BEHIND THEM SOMEHOW SOMEWHERE SO IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE SO THERE? TAKE UPON THEMSELVES TO DO THIS TRAINING ABOVE AND BEYOND. WHAT MOST FOLKS DO SO I I COMMEND YOU DEPARTMENT OR SHARE OF? FOR HAVING THE FORESIGHT TO DO THAT BUT. THE REALITY IS MOST APARTMENTS WILL NOT DO GOOD MORNING SIR GOOD MORNING. UP FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TO A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. I'M LIEUTENANT REGGIE WILLIAMS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S A ASSISTANT LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE. HERE TO APPEAR ON BEHALF OF COMMISSION WARNED STANLEY. I WILL TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE. SOBRE ALERT UM THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S ROLE AND. ACTIVATING THE SOBRE ALERT. SOME OF THE CRITERIA. THAT'S ARE REQUIRED TO ACTIVATE IT AND. DISCUSS ALMOST TO SCHOOL INFORMATION. RELATING TO THE AT. SOME OF THE. ACTIVATIONS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE RECOVERY EFFORTS. SO BASICALLY THE US OVERLOOKED PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER THE AMBER ALERT OF PROGRAM. IT. ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BROADCAST. AYE THE REGIONAL OR STATEWIDE. ALERTS FOR AT RISK SENIORS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED WHO GO MISSING UNFORTUNATELY. AND THEY MAY BE IN DANGER. DUBBED THE CHP OF COURSE SERVES AS THE STATEWIDE COORDINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM. WE WORK GO DIRECTLY WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ALLIED AGENCIES. TO DETERMINE. IF INDIVIDUALS MEET THE CRITERIA AND OF COURSE WE BROADCAST THE ALERTS OF SOME OF THE CRITERIA OF COURSE INDIVIDUAL. B. SIX FIVE YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. OF THE ARE DEVELOP MILLIE JUST DISABLED OR COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED. THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY HAS UTILIZED ALL OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LOCATE THE INDIVIDUAL. IT'S DETERMINE THE PERSON. HAS GONE MISSING UNDER UNEXPLAINED OR SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S DETERMINE THAT THEY'RE IN DANGER. THERE MAY BE IN THE COMPANY OF. INDIVIDUAL WHO. WILL PLACE THEM IN DANGER. OR OTHER FACTORS INDICATE THAT THE PERSON MIGHT BE IN PERIL. AND THERE'S INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT. IF DISSEMINATED TO THE PUBLIC. COULD ASSIST IN THE SAFE RECOVERY OF THE MISSING INDIVIDUAL. SO WITH THAT. ONCE WE. RECEIVES INFORMATION VERIFY THAT THE HAVE. MET THE CRITERIA WE WILL. ACTIVATE THE ALERT AND THAT. ALERT WILL CONSIST OF EITHER MESSAGES GOING OUT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. COMMUNICATION CENTERS THROUGH CLIPS. WEEKEND NO BROADCAST BE ON THE LOOK OUT ALERTS TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS. BUT THE ISSUE ALL POINTS BULLETIN FLYERS. AND IF THE YOU. MISSING INDIVIDUAL. ALSO INCLUDES A VEHICLE WE CAN ALSO USE THE CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS OF TO PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE. OF COURSE SIX TWENTY THIRTEEN. WE HAVE ACTIVATED OVER TWELVE HUNDRED AND THE SILVER ALERTS. AND. OF THOSE. AT LEAST OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE LOCATED BY FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS. THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR THEY JUST SIMPLY RETURN ON THEIR OWN. THE SEA EN MASSE WAS ACTIVATED. FORTY NINE TIMES. THROUGHOUT THOSE THE ACTIVATIONS AND. AT LEAST FORTY SIX INDIVIDUALS WERE RECOVERED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF A SILVER ALERT ACTIVATION. AND. NOW THAT IN IN A YEAR PERIOD OR THE ENTIRE TIME THE ENTIRE TIME SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN LET'S NOT THAT MUCH REALLY. ABOUT FORTY TO FORTY NINE. SIX FOOT FORTY NINE TIMES WE HAVE ISSUED THE. CHANGEABLE MESSAGE SIGNS. AND OF COURSE EVERY MISSING PERSON DOES NOT OF ALL VEHICLES LESS ON TIME WILL ACTIVATE THE CHANGE WILL MESSAGE SIGNS. BUT AT LEAST FORTY SIX INDIVIDUALS LOVE WERE. WERE. DEFINITELY RECOVERED JUST BASED ON THE ACTIVATIONS OVER LEARN. BUT YOU KNOW GENERALLY SPEAKING OF THESE THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL THE RETURN ON THEIR OWN. OR FAMILY MEMBER WILL LOCATE THEM IN A IN A FAMILIAR LOCATION. BUT. YOU KNOW WE WE FEEL LIKE THE SILVER ALERT IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND. RECOVERING THESE INDIVIDUALS AND RETURN THEM. SAFELY TO THEIR LOVED ONES OR TO THEIR TO THEIR PLACE OF SAFETY. SO WELL WITH THAT I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT PROGRAM WORRY ANY OF OUR OTHER. GRAMS AND WE HAVE. NO THANK YOU. THREE COMPLETE. THEIR LAST WEEK WILL BE GENTLE MARK FROM THE BUREAU OF HIS BUREAU CHIEF RETRAINING. PROGRAM SERVICES THE PROBLEM THAT DATE RESISTING TRAINS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. MORNING. PAST. SORT OF A. PART OF WHAT THIS MORNING FLORIO OFFICIAL. MAY TAKE AMINUTE TO GET OUT OF SALUTE THANK YOU KNOW THE INS AND JENNA'S FROM POSTS WHICH IS STAFFERS THAT PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. WILL PROVIDE THE TRAINING STANDARDS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA OPERATIONAL SIRS SO GOOD MORNING YES I'M JOHN A MONTH WITH A PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. I AM A RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER RISKE TWENTY THREE YEARS THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT RETIRED AS A SERGEANT. AND THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO I CAME TO WORK FOR POST AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT CONSULTANT. AT THE TIME I GOT HIRED THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN AND TWENTY NINE WERE JUST GETTING STARTED. AND BEING THE NEW GAL WITH NO NEW RESPONSIBILITIES I'M I WAS ASSIGNED TO. KIND OF FOLLOW THE LEGISLATION WAS SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE AND BECOME WHAT POST RECALL SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IN TERMS OF THE TRAINING. I'M SO I'VE BEEN WITH IT PRETTY MUCH SINCE THE BEGINNING. AND. BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED OF ME I THOUGHT I COULD GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND TO SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY NINE IS TO JUST KIND OF PLUNGING INTO THIS TO THE DATA THE STATISTICS. SO THE LEGISLATION WAS. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WENT INTO LAW AND THERE WERE TWO PIECES TO IT SENATE BILL ELEVEN. AND SENATE BILL ELEVEN HAD THE BASIC COURSE REVIEW SORT MANDATED POST TO LOOK AT THE POLICE ACADEMY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. INDETERMINATE OR NOT WE WERE. GIVING ENOUGH INFORMATION AND TRAINING TO OFFICERS TO BE COMPETENT TO COMPETENTLY HANDLE INCIDENTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL AS CO OCCURRING DISORDERS. AND THEN THEY ALSO MANDATED POSTED A VAL UP AND MAKE AVAILABLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS A TRAINING COURSE. IT WAS A MANDATE FOR POST TO CREATE THE COURSE BUT IT WAS NOT MANDATED FOR OFFICERS TO TAKE THE COURSE. S. B. TWENTY NINE COMPONENTS I'M FOCUSED ON THE FIELD TRAINING OFFICERS THEY WERE TO RECEIVE EIGHT HOURS. OF TRAINING. AND THE RISK CRITERIA LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED THAT WOULD BE CONTAINED IN THAT TRAINING. OR THEY HAD OF GOING TO A FORTY HOUR CRISS INTERVENTION COURSE IF THEY'D ATTENDED A FORTY HOUR CRISIS INVENTION QUOTE. INTERVENTION COURSE IT WAVED THE EIGHT HOUR REQUIREMENT. ADDITIONALLY THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO REVIEW THE COMPETENCIES IN THE FTO PROGRAM. AND TO INSTILL FORMER HOURS OF TRAINING FOR THE F. TEO'S. AND THEN REVIEW THE COMPETENCIES IN THE ECONOMY IN FILTERING PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE. MEETING EVERYTHING THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE LAWS. I AM JUST SO ACCUSE ANYBODY DIDN'T KNOW THESE BILLS HAD NO FUNDING ATTACHED TO THEM. SO POST RESPONSE WE HAVE LEGISLATION I'M LIKE THIS A AND WILL BE BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT. NO POST. MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IT BUT IT'S VOLUNTARY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BELONG TO POST THEY DON'T HAVE TO YOU. I'M SO JUST BECAUSE WE TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO GET TRAINING THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET TRAINING LISTED BELONG TO US. UNLESS IT'S LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED. OUR RESPONSE RESPONSE TO THIS IT THESE TWO PIECES OF LOS WERE OF FIRST THING WE DID WAS WE BROUGHT TOGETHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO REVIEW THE ACADEMY CURRICULUM AND WE INCLUDED. ANTHEM MIL ALUNOS ATTORNEY FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA SUPER. SUPER WONDERFUL WOMAN COOPERATE EXPERTS. AND WE LOOKED AT THE CURRICULUM WHICH WAS SIX HOURS LONG AT THE TIME. AND. BEEFED UP TO FIFTEEN HOURS AND THAT THAT SATISFY THE CIVIC MATTER EXPERTS IN TERMS OF. WHAT POLICE RECRUITS WERE GETTING? NEXT WE REVIEWED AND UPDATED THE I'M SORRY BROUGHT TOGETHER SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS REVIEWED UPDATED BASIC COURSE CURRICULUM. IT FELL ON ME TO THEN CLICK SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO CREATE THE POST COURSE WHICH WAS THE SMALLER SHORTER COURSE WE CAME UP WITH A FOUR HOUR COURSE. IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR ANY AGENCY TO DOWNLOAD AND USE WE CAN CERTIFY FOR THEM AND USE OF THEIR AGENCY TO TEACH. WE EVEN MET THE FOR OUT THE FOUR HOUR COURSE RECRUIT REQUIREMENT IN THE FORTY HOUR. SO FILL TRAINING OFFICERS FROM THEIR POINT A TO OFFICE HAVE TO GO TO A FORTY HOUR COURSE TO TEACH THEM HOW TO BE TRAINING OFFICERS. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THAT COURSE WE WILL FOUR HOURS OF THE S. B. ELEVEN SP TWENTY NINE TRAINING CRITERIA INTO IT. AND A LOT OF IT WE DID BY FILMING NEW VIDEOS THAT SHOWED OFFICERS INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR MENTAL HEALTH. MOST AND FOCUS ON CRISIS TYPE. SITUATIONS AND TEACHING THE BILL TRAINING OFFICERS HOW TO COACH THE RECRUITS TO THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. AND THEN FOR WHAT I SAW WAS A NEED FOR THE FIELD WAS. THE KNOW HOW THIS EIGHT HOUR STANDALONE CORE SET OF TOOLS HAVE TO GO TO AND A LOT OF THE THE TRAINING OFFICERS ARE CALLING IN DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CRITERION THE MANDATES WERE. SO. I HELPED THEM TO CREATE AN EIGHT HOUR OUTLINE FOR THE FTO COURSE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE SO YOU NEED TO SEE THAT WANTED TO DO THE COURSE ON THEIR OWN. COULD DOWNLOAD IT CERTIFIED THROUGH ME WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD GOOD QUALIFIED INSTRUCTORS AND TEACH THE COURSE ON THEIR OWN. AND LAST FALL WE PUT UP BUT DID YOU KNOW VIDEO WHICH A LOT OF THE OFFICERS LIKE IT HELPS TO ADVERTISE LOOK WE NEED MORE TRAINING. SO THE TRUTH CRITERIA THAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH IN THE BILL'S. WAS THAT THEIR TRAINING HAD TO BE CLASSROOM BASED SO THEY COULDN'T GET IT OFF THE INTERNET. INSTRUCTOR LED AND A BIG ONE. WAS STIGMA REDUCTION AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT. NO ONE I WAS ASSIGNED TO MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING OPPOSED I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO DOWNLOAD REVIEW EVERY SINGLE COURSE THAT EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY ALREADY HAD IN PLACE AT THE TIME THAT BILLS. AND BELIEVE ME THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM THIS OWN TRAINING WAS NOT NEW TRAINING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY MANY AGENCIES HAD INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO TRAINING THEIR OFFICERS IN FACT SOMEONE CPT. A MEDICINAL COUNTY HAS HAD FORTY OUR COURSES SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT THEY BROUGHT OVER FROM MEMPHIS TENNESSEE. BUT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL WAS I DIDN'T FIND ANY OF THEM THAT ADDRESS CULTURAL RELEVANCY. AND. THE BILL'S DUE TO INTRODUCE THAT ASPECT TO IT. BECAUSE NATURE INDICATORS APPROPRIATE RESPONSES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CRISIS. ON CONFLICT RESOLUTION DE ESCALATION IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO. ADDRESS MOSTLY DISTRUST INDIVIDUALS. COMEDIAN STATE RESOURCES AND PERSPECTIVE OF FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS. SO I WAS ASKED NGUYEN. AND ASTRONAUTS THE QUESTION YOU KNOW WHY DOES THE TRAINING LOOKS A PIECEMEAL WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. AND HERE'S THE REASON THAT IT LOOKS PIECEMEAL IS. USED TO HOP THESE COURSES F. TEO'S ARE MANDATED TO DO EIGHT HOURS OR IF THEY HAD A FORTY YEAR FORTY HOUR COURSE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THE EIGHT HOURS. SO LOOKING AT THE TRAIN CRITERIA OVERLAP THERE IS FORGIVENESS IF YOU ALREADY HAD A FORTY HOUR COURSE. S. B. ELEVEN SP TWENTY NINE HAVE THE SAME EXACT CRITERIA WITH VENOM THOUGH THERE'S A LITTLE LAST FOR S. B. ELEVEN. AND SO THERE'S THAT KIND OF AN OVERLAP IF YOU HAD FORTY THEN YOU DON'T NEED THE EIGHT AND IF YOU. HAVE THE EIGHT. THAT YOU HAD BUT IF YOU HAD ANOTHER COURSE YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE THE AIDS THERE'S ALL THIS OVERLAPPING WITH THE TRAINING WHICH IS WHY IT DOES LOOK PIECEMEAL THAT AND. THE NUMBERS AND HERE'S THE NUMBERS. IN A VERY SHORT TIMEFRAME THESE TO NOT GO BACK TO JUNE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS IS JUST JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO FABRIC TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. UM TRAINING THIS BEEN DELIVERED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S SB ELEVEN AS BETWEEN NINE AS WELL AS OTHER MENTAL HEALTH COURSES LIKE THE LA ESOS THIRTY TWO HOUR COURSE. SO IN BASIC COURSE IN THIS TIME PERIOD. THIRTY PRISONERS PUT ON SIXTY TWO PRESENTATIONS AND RICH TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX POLICE RECRUITS. FOR SENATE BILL ELEVEN WHICH IS AGAIN THE DOWNLOADER CORSETS NON MANDATED COURSE. EIGHT PRISONERS PUT ON NINETY SIX PRESENTATION RICH TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY SEVEN STUDENTS. GUS IS A LOT ABOUT WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS RIGHT NOW IN THE PERSPECTIVE ON HOW POOR IN THIS TRAINING IS. BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING TO DO THIS TRAINING THEY ON THEIR OWN. DOWNLOADED THE COURSE SAID OKAY LET'S OFFER THIS. SENATE BILL TWENTY NINE WE HAD TWENTY TWO PRESENTERS SEVENTY TWO PRINT PRESENTATIONS ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE STUDENTS. NOW THAT'S THE EIGHT OUR STAND ALONE COURSE FOR FTA OWES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE STUDENTS WERE JUST FTA OWES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SENDING ALL OF THEIR PERSONNEL TO THE CLASS.% OTHER COURSES SOME THE PRESENTERS WERE OVERLAPPING SO I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF THEM THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE PRESENTATIONS OF OTHER TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH COURSES ARE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COURSES. AND FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE STUDENTS WERE REACHED. SO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME EIGHT MONTHS YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED NINETEEN PRESENTATIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH TEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TRAINED IN THESE PRESENTATIONS. BUT BUT INFERENCES. FARMHOUSE CLOSELY THOUSAND PERSONNEL SO I MEAN TEN THOUSANDS. IT'S REALLY IN THAT IS THAT IS THE DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF LOT FOR SMALL SIR STATEWIDE. SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. LA US SO I BELIEVE AS MOST OF THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE FORTY HOUR COURSES DON'T JUST OFFER THEIR COURSES TO THEIR OWN OFFICERS THEY OPEN THEM UP TO OTHER AGENCIES. AND THAT MIGHT BE DROPPED BACK TO BE LOOK AT LAPD THEY HAVE TEN THOUSAND OFFICERS BUT THEY'VE BEEN TEACHING THESE COURSES FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO START AT GROUND ZERO IN TEACHING OFFICERS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SUBSTANTIAL GROUND GAINED IN TRAINING PEOPLE THOUGHT SUPPORT TO KEEP UPDATED TRAINING FOR THEM AS WELL. PRODUCTS OF THE IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAT ONE ISSUE I HAVE IS FUNDING BECAUSE THE STATE. MANDATES A LOT OF COURSES. THAT HE WILL DO THIS EXPLAINS THE BUT YET FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED SO IT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE. YOU TALK ABOUT TRAINING THEY'LL T. PERSONAL SKILLS I MEAN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT. AMONG HIS ORGANIZATIONS THEY HAVE A FINITE NUMBER OF DOLLARS FOR TRAINING. AND THEY'RE GONNA PERSONAL SKILLS IMPORTANT SIDE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT OF COURSE OF COURSE. SO FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IF THEY BELONG TO THE POST PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. AND FOURTEEN HOURS OF IT IS MANDATED FOR PERSONAL SKILLS WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO DO COMMUNICATIONS TRAINING. EMERGENCY VEHICLE OPERATIONS FIREARMS TRAINING IN DEFENSIVE TACTICS. FIREARMS IN THE IRAQ THERE TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE COURSES THAT CAN BE OUT THERE AND THEY CAN RANGE UP TO SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY JUST TEACHING OFFICER. FOR THE TUITION ALONE IF YOU LOOK AT TRAVEL COST YOU COULD BE AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A DAY FOR A LONG FORSMAN OFFICER. IN THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE COST OF WHAT IT TAKES TO GET HIM OFF THE STREET BUT WHAT IS THE AGENCY PAYNG IN OVERTIME TO COVER THEM AS WELL. SO TRAINING IF YOU LOOK AT AN EIGHT HOUR LET'S LOOK AT EIGHT HOUR COURSELET'S NOT THINK TALK ABOUT BACK PAY. IT'S A REASONABLE OFTEN OFFICER ATTENDS AN EIGHT HOUR. IN CLASSROOM COURSES DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY YOU KNOW FANCY EQUIPMENT WOULD BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR TROUBLE COSTS INTO HER FIFTY DOLLARS TUITION. IF YOU MULTIPLY THAT TIMES EIGHTY THOUSAND OFFICERS THAT'S I THINK ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO TRAIN EVERY OFFICER IN THE STATE. THIS EXPENSIVE. SO I KNOW POSTED THOUGHT OBVIOUSLY IF THAT BACK OVER YEARS GOING BACK IN TIME. THEIR BILL LOT MORE MANDATES. PUT ALL POST. FOR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BUT THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF FUNDING. GIVEN THE POST BY THE LEGISLATURE. THAT IS CORRECT WE GET A LOT OF UNFUNDED MANDATES. SO THAT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE KEEP ISSUING RULES AND WE WANT TO DO THIS THIS THIS AND THIS AND THIS. AND YET IS NOT BEING FUNDED. SO YOU NOT FORCES CAN WE JUST LOOK LIKE ON THE THE IMPORTANT SKILLS. FIRE TRAINING DRIVING PERSONAL SKILLS SO THEY JUST UP IN SOME DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. AND GO ABOVE AND BEYOND AND YOU KNOW SOME DEL BECAUSE YOU'RE THOUGH YOU GIVE THAT BUDGET BY YOU THE BOARD SUPERVISORS OR. YOU KNOW CITY COUNCIL SO IT IS A TOUGH SITUATION SO. IT'S CRACKED YEAH THANK YOU. THINKING NO EASY ANSWERS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS NO. THOMAS I WOULD OPEN UP A PUBLIC COMMENT SO THOSE FOLKS WISHING TO SPEAK. PLEASE OPPOSE MICROPHONE LET ME HEAR FROM YOUR THOUGHTS AND COMMENTS. IT. MORNING. CHAIRMAN. VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE AFTER. I AM. NOT ENOUGH FOR THE FOR THE ROOM. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME NO YOU HAVE WHAT'S BETTER DEBORAH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN COOPER FOR HOLDING THE HEARING ALSO APPRECIATE THE COURTESIES OF. YOUR STAFF. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE PHONE MR ZIGLAR AND I AND SO I AM I AM AWARE OF. SERVICE ARE YOU BOTH HAVE PROVIDED IN THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE TRAINING AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THAT YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT ABOUT IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTING. WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR LAST WITNESS. THIS MONK WHO GAVE A SHOUT OUT TO ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS. POP UP KAMALA LIEU OF WE TRY TO. WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH. OTHERS WHO ARE SHARING OUR GOALS OF TRYING TO. PROMOTE THE RIGHTS AND INDEPENDENCE AND DIGNITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE PRIMARY REASON I WANTED TO COME UP HERE AND AND SPEAK TODAY. I IS THAT. UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT IN FAVOR OF A BILL THAT GOT MENTIONED. AB FOR THIRTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR AND I KNOW THAT SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO I I. DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WE'RE CRITICAL OF THIS PROGRAM A CRITICAL OF THAT PROGRAM. THEIR WIT THERE WAS. THIS THE IDEA OF THE STATEWIDE REGISTRY. AND WE. WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMEONE WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR HIMSELF OR HERSELF DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON THAT REGISTRY. OR IF A CONSERVATIVE OR WHO DIDN'T NECESSARILY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE AT HEART. WE WHAT WE WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE WERE APPARENTLY VERY CLOSE I WASN'T WORKING ON pWORKING THINGS OUT WITH THE SPONSORS OF THAT BILL. FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO MENTION ALSO THAT. LISTENING TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES REMINDED ME OF SOME OF THE EARLY HEARINGS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. NOW MAYOR STEINBERG WAS CHAIRING THE STATE'S BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON AUTISM. AND I REMEMBER HEARING. SOME DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY BY ONE MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION ABOUT THE. VERY DEEP CONCERN SHE HAD HER SON WAS ATTENDING COLLEGE AND AND I DON'T KNOW IF HER SON WAS EVER GOING TO HAVE A AYE DIFFICULTIES IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. MAY SAY THE WRONG THING TO A POLICE OFFICER YOU YOU YOU HEARD. I THINK MORE THAN ONE PERSON EXPLAINED THAT IF IT IF THERE HASN'T BEEN TRAINING IF POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT A CERTAIN BEHAVIOR MIGHT WE ARE NOT LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND SO IS IT'S VERY HEARTENING? I SEE TEN YEARS LATER THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON WHATEVER MAY FOLLOW AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU GOING KNOWLEDGE A SALOON A CERVANTES FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THANK YOU KNOW EVEN IN COMMITTEE THANKS FOR MAKING IT DOWN HERE. MY NAME'S JEFF TARGET HERE AND I DO EXPECT TO SEE YOU MISTER COOPER LATER ON THIS MONTH PERSONALLY. WILL WORK ON THEIR BOTTOM I APPRECIATE THIS AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE AVAILABLE AND MORE WIDESPREAD TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT. I KNOW ONCE YOU IN SACRAMENTO IS IS IT STILL WORKING ON OUR DEAR MAYOR. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND THE FACT THAT NOT ALL OF HIS OFFICERS ARE EVEN YET TRAINED IN UNDERSTANDING MENTAL HEALTH. IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY REALLY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND. THESE PROBLEMS. AND YEAH I'M COMING ON THAT'S A GREAT COMMENT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A. THE STATE HAS A SURPLUS BUDGET THIS YEAR THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. SO IF YOU IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT REALLY THEY COULD. AND THERE TRANSMIT MONEY EVERYWHERE ON EVERYTHING BUT. SINCE THIS IS BEEN IT'S BEEN THE NEWS ALL OVER THE PLACE WE KNOW ABOUT IT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH FOLKS. THEY'RE MENTALLY ILL WE'VE SEEN SOME INTERACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SO GREAT. SO WHY NOT A BETTER TIME TO YOU SOME OF THE EXCESS FUNDS. FOR TRAINING. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S THAT'S PART WHERE YOU GOT COMMAND. AND THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT NOW WITH COMMUNICANTS IN TOGETHER AS A WHOLE. TO FIGHT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SOME THIS MORNING GIVE THESE FOLKS TRAINED. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE INCIDENTS. AND LASTLY O. ALSO MAKE A COMMENT THIS IS PLEASE CHECK WITH THE AUTHOR OF. OF S. B. EIGHT THIRTY THREE THIS IS DEALING WITH THE YEAR. SHE WAS THE EMERGENCY CONTACT BECAUSE A OF FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY THAT IS WHAT WHO'S DETERMINED AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT COME SIMPLY. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT REACH OUT AND HOW TO MAKE THAT EXPRESSION ONLY AND THAT'S A BILL THAT WAS THIS MORNING DISCUSSED EIGHT THIRTY THREE DEALING WITH THE YEAR. HOME WITH THE EMERGENCY. ALERT SYSTEM. HOME SO ANYWAY. GUYS APPRECIATE LISTENING TO YOU THIS ROOM MADE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SHOW IN HERE SO I JUST CAME IN LIKE THIS IN HERE. AND I WILL GO ON TO A. OTHER HEARINGS TODAY AND TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION SEWING APPLICANT IN YES GROW VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS DOG FIGHT CALIFORNIA FOR ALLIANCE A RETIRED AMERICANS. I'M AND ALL AND OTHER ISSUES THAT TO ALL OF WHICH ARE THINGS THAT TO. THE DISABILITY.

KNOW I I JUST CERTAINLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE AT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR ACTUALLY BRINGING THIS TO THE FOREFRONT HOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES I ESPECIALLY FROM OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IMPACTS MANY RESIDENTS AND CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. HELLO MY NAME IS CAROL MEDINA AND I'M FROM SANDRA DINO COUNTY. AND I A WOULD. LIKE TO SHARE THAT MY SON. HE'S A CLIENT OF INLAND REGIONAL CENTER AND HE DOES HAVE THE IF I NEED HELP LABELS. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU GUYS THAT. YOU KNOW HE'S ABOUT TO BE EIGHTEEN. AND.

A. ON A SIDE NOTE I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT MY SON. HAS HAD A PREVIOUS HEAD INJURY FROM. PROP GROUP PRONE RESTRAINT. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE HE AYE. HE HAS SLOW PROCESSING IT DOESN'T. RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO COMMUNICATION ESPECIALLY IF IT'S OUR INITIAL COMMUNICATION AND SO HE WOULD BE SLOW TO RESPOND BUT THE SAME TIME. WHEN HE'S TRYING TO COMMUNICATE BECAUSE HE'S HIGHLY VERBAL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION WHERE HE WOULD KNOW IT DATED DATED IS. LOOK HIS OWN ADDRESS THINGS TO THAT. CRITICAL INFORMATION LIFE INFORMATION HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE A GIVE AND TAKE OF COMMUNICATION THAT WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR. AND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE HEAD INJURY I HAVE FEARS. BECAUSE. YOU KNOW. WHAT IF NOW THAT IS AN ADULT MEAN OUR WE GONNA HAVE THE SAME ISSUE INTO ADULTHOOD? VERSES HIS CHILDHOOD. AND. I AS A MOM.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS ROBERT BY BLOW TO A GROUP CALLED DOC BUT WHICH IS DISABILITIES GROUP HERE KNOW THAT SACRAMENTO. A LEGACY YET MANDATORY. CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING. HELLO THE SEA EVERY OFFICER TRAINED AL HUNT THEY DE ESCALATE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES OR PFT V.. I LIKED ALSO SEE HOW IT'S WORKING A YEARLY REVIEW HOW MUCH WORKING IN THE IT ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. IN CALIFORNIA I WAS YOU KNOW SITUATIONS WHERE THE POLICE OFFICERS. KILL THE JOSEPH MAN HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUPLE YEARS AGO I DON'T SEE THAT NO MORE. BECAUSE IF TO HEAR THE HOMELESS GUY WHO WOULD BET MENTAL DISABILITY IN THE PLEASE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO. DO FDF TRAINING ON HIM. BECAUSE THE PARTY WASN'T TRAINED WELL ENOUGH. I LIKE TO SEE ALL POLICE OFFICERS TRAINED. ON HOW DO PDF GET LATE. SITUATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS JULIE WILL BORROW. I'M FROM LOS BANOS CALIFORNIA. HER WORLD TOWN AND. I CAME HERE WITH MY UNION UAW. ON LAW AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE A PART OF MY UNION. I AM A AND HOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. TO THE IHS US PROGRAM WHICH IS AND HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. AND. I HAVE A CHILD WHO IS NINE YEARS OLD. WHO IS MODERATE SEVERE AUTISM WITH VOCABULARY EXTREME VOCABULARY? SO HERE WE GO INTO SPECTRUM. MY CHILD HAS COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND I BUT HE DOES NOT PRAGMATIC SO BASICALLY THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL. REAL COMMUNICATION HOW GO ON AND ON ABOUT. LEGOS MINECRAFT WOULD YOU LIKE SEE CAN USE BIG WORDS HE CAN READ HE'S GOT AN IQ OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BUT HE HAS THE FUNCTIONAL. AND SKILLS OF PROBABLY AT OF FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD IN REGARDS TO SAFETY. AND SELF AWARENESS. EXTREMELY RATIONAL ON VIOLENT AT TIMES. AND IMPULSIVE. BECAUSE HE I AM.

INTERVENTION WITH A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. OR A SOCIAL WORKER OR ANOTHER. YOU NOW AUTHORITY FIGURE THAT WILL HAVE TO COME AND ASSESS THE SCHOOL. AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT. DID HE BECOME ST. BECAUSE I A PRETTY SURE WE DON'T HOW ABOUT PROGRAM MINERAL LOS BANOS DEFINITELY. SURE. AND A LOT OF TIMES. I FEAR THAT IF I'M IN A CAR ACCIDENT I'M RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS THAT MY CHILD REALLY LOW FROM THE VEHICLE. AND IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR OFFICERS TO KNOW BY RUNNING MY PLAY OR EVEN MY ID CARD. MY CHILD COULD BE RUNNING DOWN HIGHWAY AND GET HIT TOLD BY VEHICLE BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS UNAVAILABLE. A POLICE OFFICER WHO MY APPROACH MY CHILD AS AN ADULT MAY FEEL. THAT. THERE THREATENS AND THEREFORE HAVE TO RESPOND IN NOW IN A WAY THAT CAN BE AVOIDED BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION. COULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO POLICE OFFICER. AND I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO HAS A BRAIN INJURY IN PTSD AS WELL AND LET ME TELL YOU. THERE IS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES BETWEEN PTSD. AND SO OFTEN SOME BECAUSE IT'S A FIRE FIGHT RESPONSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE. THE LANGUAGE OR THE ABILITY TO REGULATE YOURSELF EMOTIONALLY. SO I KNOW FROM MY HUSBAND IF HE GETS ARRESTED THERE OR. AGENCIES ARE WAYS TO IDENTIFY. AND TO REACH OUT TO THE VA SO THAT MY HUSBAND DOESN'T END UP YOU KNOW IN A SITUATION WHERE HE'S. IT DEALT WITH UNFAIRLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY VERY RELATED TO MILITARY. AND UNDERSTAND PTSD SO I THINK WE JUST BRING US AWARENESS OUR ROUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE. MENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES WE CAN ALSO CREATE THE SAME SYSTEM. THAT WILL KEEP NOT ONLY OUR OFFICER SAFE BUT OUR KIDS SAVE. MAN ARE ADULTS THAT HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY SAFE AND IT'S NECESSARY FOR ALL OF THE OFFICERS. AND ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED WITH SO THAT WE CAN PREVENT. ENORMOUS TREATMENT. OR. ES SITUATION THAT ESCALATES TO A POINT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. I THINK IT'D BE REALLY GREAT TO SEE FUNDING ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL FOR FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LISA COLEMAN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CHALCO AYE THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. HOW I AM BUDS MEN'S ARE AT THE ADVOCATES FOR RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE BEDS? BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SENIORS OLDER ADULTS THAT HAVE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING THAT REQUIRE CARE GIVING. SO. I'M HERE TO SAY THAT THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS BROADER THAN JOSH. ODD THE DD COMMUNITY IT'S BROADER THAN OUR OLDER ADULTS. IT'S IT'S BROADER THAN A FINANCIAL ASK THAT LAW. LAW ENFORCEMENT GET THIS TRAINING WE AS CITIZENS NEED TO GET THIS TRAINING THIS KIND OF INFORMATION OF HOW DO WE DEAL WITH ONE ANOTHER IS BROADER THAN JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARM IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MY HUSBAND AND I SPENT NEW YEAR'S EVE SEARCHING FOR AN OLDER GENTLEMAN ELK GROVE WHO HAD WANDERED OFF. AND BOB IT WAS A SILVER ALERT THAT CAME THROUGH OUR CELL PHONES THAT THAT GOT US IN. GODDESS WALKING OUT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE GAVE UP WE DIDN'T FIND AND WE GAVE UP ON. THE GOOD NEWS WISE WE LEARNED LATER THAT HE WAS FOUND ON THE FRUSTRATING NEWS WAS WE WERE OUT AN HOUR AFTER HE HAD BEEN FOUND SO MAYBE SUBSISTENCE TO CALL AN ALL CLEAR. WIN THE SILVER ALERT HAS BEEN FOUND I TAKE HOME THAT SAYS WE WERE SUCCESSFUL AND WE GOT HIM HOME WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND JUST TO BRING ATTENTION. THE ALERT SYSTEMS WORK. WHEN YOU HAVE A CARE GIVER THAT'S. THAT SIGNING A PERSON NOT. BUT WE KNOW THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL OF THE PERSONS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S CURRENTLY LIVE ALONE. SO THERE WOULDN'T BE A CARE GIVER TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THIS PERSON IS LAUGHED. AND WORSE THAN JUST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE POPULATION. HE LIVES ALONE WE KNOW THAT FORTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE DISEASE ACTUALLY GET A DIAGNOSIS. SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR.
