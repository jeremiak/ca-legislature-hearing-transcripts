ANY PROBLEM WITH THIS PROCEEDING NOW USUALLY WE LIKE TO EXTEND THE COURTESY OF. OUR FORGET. SO OF WE HAVE ONE MATTER BEFORE US SO I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT FOR THAT MEASURE WE WILL ABIDE BY THE POLICY WE HAVE IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE BE TWO MAIN WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH FOR SUPPORT AND SIMILARLY TO MAIN WITNESSES TO MANAGE EACH IN OPPOSITION. ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINION WILL CALL UPON THOSE IN ADDITION IN SUPPORT TO PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION ONLY AND WILL DO THE SAME THING AFTER THE OPPOSITION TO WITNESSESIF THERE ARE YOU HAVE TO WE DON'T NEED TO GO ON FOREVER TO WE CERTAINLY TIED TO THOSE WHO ARE HERE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO WITH THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN YOU HAVE AB FOR SIXTY FIVE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR THIS BILL TODAY INTO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON AND I KNOW OFTENTIMES BILLS INTRODUCED IN THE SECOND HOUSE. CAN BE TIME CONSUMING FOR PEOPLE AND EXPECT IT'S BUT I'D APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT AN ANTI THIS. AB OR SIXTY FIVE. A% BILL TO BETTER PROTECT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE FROM GUN VIOLENCE. AB FOR SIXTY FIVE WOULD CODIFY TO EXISTING CALIFORNIA RULES OF COURT THAT ESTABLISH A JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS. FOR COURTS TO ENSURE THAT FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE. I WOULD MAKE THIS PROCESS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WOULD ALSO ALIGNED THE CIVIL RULES LANGUAGE WITH THE CRIMINAL RULE WHICH MANDEECEES PROCESS SEES REQUIRES AN EXPEDITED REVIEW PERIOD. CALIFORNIA 33% OF WOMEN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. OR OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED CALLS PERSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER 45% OF THOSE CALLS REPORTED SOME TYPE OF WEAPON BEING USED IN THE INCIDENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE POSSESSION OF A FIREARM ANY TIME THERE'S VIOLENCE OCCURRING. INCREASES THE RISK OF HOMICIDE BY AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN FACT OVER HALF OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. VICTIMS HAVE BEEN KILLED WITH A FIREARM. A MONTH AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY TWO WOMEN ARE SHOT AND KILLED IN THE UNITED STATES BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER. AND THERE ARE NEARLY ONE MILLION WOMEN ALIVE RIGHT NOW UNITED STATES WHO HAVE BEEN SHOT AT. OR SHOT BY A AN INTIMATE PARTNER. EVEN WITH OUR STATES ROBUST FIRE LEGISLATION THERE ARE STILL OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND ARMED PROHIBITED PERSONS WHO HAVE FAILED TO RELINQUISH THEIR WEAPONS. OF THOSE 2300018% BECOME A PROHIBITIVE PERSON DUE TO A RESTRAINING ORDER. UNDER EXISTING LAW RIGHT NOW. WHEN A PERSON BECOMES A SUBJECT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER THEY AUTOMATICALLY. BECOME A PROHIBITIVE PERSON WHO ARE REQUIRED TO RELINQUISH ANY AND ALL FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION WITHIN THEIR POSSESSION OR CONTROL WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THE TWO RULES OF COURT INTENDED TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON A LIMITED AND OFTEN TIMES IN CONSISTENT BASIS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN THE CIVIL CONTEXT THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING BECAUSE THE ONLY JUDICIAL OFFICER WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT PROCESS IS THE JUDGE. AND THE SURVIVOR. WHO FILED FOR THE STRAINING ORDER. AS OFTEN SELF REPRESENTED SO WITH THAT AB. IT'S ME GETS A RESTRAINING ORDER BY LAW THEY ARE REQUIRED TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIRE ARMS WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE DONE SO. OFTENTIMES WHEN WOMEN GO BEFORE WHEN THEY'RE THE JUDGES SINGING FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE NOT REPRESENTED. SO THEY MAY NOT KNOW TO EVEN ASK AND THE JUDGE THEY'RE VERY BUSY OFTENTIMES DON'T ASK HAVE YOU RELINQUISH YOUR FIREARMS. IS THERE PROOF OF THAT. THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT STANDARD ACROSS IT IS ALREADY REQUIRED THAT THEY GIVE UP THEIR GUNS BUT THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO PROCESS. TO CHECK TO SEE IF THEY HAVE OR HAVE NOT LEAVING IT UP OFTENTIMES TO THE- VICTIM OF THAT VIOLENCE TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE JUDGE YOU NEED TO ASK THEM FOR THEIR FIREARMS. THAT SHOULDN'T BE US SO THAT'S WITH THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THE FIRST TIME. THAT PERSON COMES BEFORE THE JUDGE THAT THEY ASK THEM THEN HAVE YOU RELINQUISH YOUR ARMS AND IS THERE SOME KIND OF PROOF OF THAT. WITH. ME HERE TODAY THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE- TWENTY. IS. GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER PRESENT PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE PROCESS IS ALISON CAP PART THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES THAT WE'VE WHO REPRESENTS SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN COURT AT NO COST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON I. I AM ALISON COME PART I AM THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES WITH LEAVE I'M SORRY. YOUR CAN HEAR ME A LITTLE BIT BETTER I AM THE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES WITH WE OF AND ALLIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. EGGMAN NOTED I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ABOUT THAT PROCESS TODD THAT SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GO THROUGH IN. PARTICULARLY IN FAMILY COURT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON. PLEASE PROCEED TO MINUTES IF YOU WERE THANK YOU AT THANK YOU CHAIR WOMEN THIS IS TRACY KENNY I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I ACTUALLY HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF STAFFING THE FAMILY AND YOU CAN A LOT VICE RE COMMITTEE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH WOULD BE CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION WERE TO BE ENACTED SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT COMMITTEE HAD ABOUT HOW WE WOULD GO ABOUT IT I MEAN THIS THIS NATION BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THAT IS READY. TO GO FOR IN THE WAY THAT WE DON'T EVEN SURE HOW TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF IT BECAUSE OF THE AMBIGUITIES WE ALSO THINK THERE WOULD BE SERIOUS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF IT WERE TO BE ENACTED IN THIS FORM AND IT IS NOT THAT WE DON'T. TAKE THESE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT CHAIRED BY TWO VERY FOLKS WERE VERY INTERESTED IN ENSURING THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED THAT OUR ORDERS ARE IN FORCE WE THINK THAT IS AT LAUDABLE GOAL AND ONE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DO THAT. IN A TIME PERIOD THAT ALLOWS US TO GET THE DETAILS RIGHT BECAUSE THESE ARE COURTS THAT HAVE VERY HIGH VOLUMES AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEKING PROTECTION AND IF WE ADD A HUGE VOLUME OF NEW HEARINGS AND TO PROTECT NO ONE EVEN SHOWS UP BECAUSE. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ARE VERY VERY TO EMAIL SIR. IN THE STRAIN PERSON NOT EVEN GETTING SERVICE OF THE HEARING. SO YOU HAVE A REVIEW HEARING ON FIREARMS WHICH YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN A PERSON SEEKS A PROTECTIVE ORDER. THEY THERE IS A QUESTION ON THAT TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER REQUEST FORM DO DOES THAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE RESTRAINT PERSON HAS A GUN. AND YOU SAY YES NO OR I DON'T KNOW SO THE COURT MAY HAVE A FORM THAT HAS A CHECK BOX I DON'T KNOW THAT'S THIS. EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT HAS TO MAKE THESE SPECIFIC AND DETAILED FINDINGS OF FACT THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION. I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT. ON THE REVISED FORM FOR THE COURT TO THEN TRY TO DETERMINE DO THEY HAVE A GUN OR NOT DO THEY MAKE A FINDING THAT THEY HAVE A GUN OR NOT MAKE A FINDING THAT THEY HAVE A GUN TO THEY SAID A REVIEW HEARING THE- CASE. IS IT IN TWO DAYS AND IF. NO ONE SHOWS UP THAT REVIEW HEARING WHAT IS THE COURT EXPECTED TO DO. THEIR REQUIREMENTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION OVER THE RESTRAINT PERSON. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS WHICH IS THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION OVER ME OR YOU HOW IS THE CORTES. THAT IS WHO IN THAT ENTITY. IS THE COURT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT'S NOT SPECIFIED. LEGISLATION BUT- FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF GETTING. GUNS FROM RESTRAIN PARTIES WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY. GREAT MODEL IN SAN MATEO COUNTY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE. EXPANDED TO MORE OF THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. LOOKS AT ALL OF THESE RESTRAINING ORDERS AS THEY COME IN AND- ANY. ONE WHERE IT SAYS. YES OR EVEN I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE CALLING. THE RESTRAINED PARTY THEY'RE CHECKING UP ON THM THEY'RE CHECKING THE DATABASE IS TO SEE IF THEY'RE REGISTERED FIREARMS AND THEY ARE. GETTING THE SURRENDER OF MANY MANY MANY FIRE I THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO PROTECT PEOPLE. NOT TO UP LOAD OUR COURT COUNT THANK YOU FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY AND I THINK THAT. MAY GIVE US SOME. GUIDANCE GOING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WITNESS. OUR COMMENTS REALLY ALIGNED WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO I'LL KEEP MY TESTIMONY BRIEF. BUT AS WAS SAID FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE RELINQUISHMENT OF FIREARMS BY RESTRAIN PERSONS. IS A SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AND THE COURTS PLAY A BIG ROLE IN THAT. BUT WE NEED A THOUGHTFUL SOLUTION AND AS WRITTEN AB FOR SIXTY FIVE IS NOT THAT. AB FOR SIXTY FIVE YEAR HAS TOO MANY TEETH BECAUSE OF SEPARATION OF POWER ISSUES. BRAILLE MEANT ISSUES AND DUE PROCESS CONCERNS OR NOT ENOUGH TEETH BECAUSE THERE'S NO BENCH WARRANTS NO EXPLICIT CONTENT AND NO DUTY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE. BECAUSE OF THE LAST MINUTE CONSIDERATION THIS BILL MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT NO ANSWERS PROVIDED AN AS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL JUST BROUGHT UP ONE SUCH SUCH QUESTION IS WILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN MUCH MORE GUN RELINQUISH MINUTES. THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING IS A WORTHY ONE AND ONE THAT CJ'S NOT ONLY WILLING TO ENGAGE IN BUT IS EAGER TO ENGAGE IN IN THE FALL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION. AND FIND THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT THESE PROTECTED PERSONS THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I APPRECIATE. THE R. ARTICULATION OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION I AM THOSE STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO START ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM I KNOW HAVING. LISTENED THIS MORNING AT THE IN PUBLIC SAFETY THE STORY ABOUT. THE INDIVIDUALS PRIMARILY WOMEN BUT NOT NECESSARILY EXCLUSIVELY WHO ARE AT RISK AND WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE EITHER WITNESSED OR BEEN MURDERED AS WELL. AND I HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION IN MY OWN DISTRICT THE NUMBER YEARS AGO FOR WHICH I THEN BROUGHT LEGISLATION THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO KEEP GROWING. AND HI HAVE DISCUSSES SO WITH THE AUTHOR WHO WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO CONTINUE. TO TIGHTEN THIS UP FIVE I WAS AND WHERE THE SAN MATTEO MODEL BUT I SUSPECT THAT IT'S ONE THAT WE CAN PURSUE GOING FORWARD SO ARE YEAH. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR I DO WANT TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN. INSIST ON SORT OF PUTTING THE KNEE AND EVERYONE'S BACK WHETHER IT'S TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I SERVE ON THAT SO I KNOW THEY WILL DO A- VERY COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO BRING THIS. MATTER TO SOME KIND OF A DOABLE PROCESS AND- BEING THE SPOUSE OF A RETIRED JUDGE HE SAID ON THE CGA I. UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COURTS WHO ARE CLEARLY OVERWHELMED PARTICULARLY IN FAMILY LAW. THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO THIS I KEEP THINKING. YOU KNOW. THE PRIVATE SECTOR KNOWS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT US. WHY CAN'T WE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SECTOR HAVE OF THE KIND OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHERE A COURT CAN ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDER I'M THINKING YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOW THAT A PERSON HAS A REAL HAS A GUN YOU JUST SIMPLY SAY. A RESTRAINING ORDERS BEEN ISSUED IF THIS PERSON HAS FIRE ARMS THEY MUST BE RELINQUISHED HE GOES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY CHECK IF THE APP SYSTEMS ACTUALLY FUNCTIONING PROPERLY THEY COULD FIND IT OUT IN A HEART BEAT. THEY COULD HAVE A DESIGNATED TO. PORTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THOSE GUNS WERE. ROUTE RELINQUISHED MEAN THAT THIS COULD BE DONE IF WE REALLY BUT OUR- OUR MINDS TO IT AND CERTAINLY WOULD SAVE A LOT ALIVE SO I WANT TO. COMMEND THE AUTHOR IT'S AN URGENT ISSUE AND CERTAINLY GOTTEN A MAN'S AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND NOT THE FAVORITE WAY OF DOING THINGS HERE BUT- YOU KNOW THAT TWO DOLLARS YOU CAN GET YOU COFFEE IN THE MALL. OF COURSE A THREE DOLLARS BUT ANYWAY. THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT WHEN I WENT THANK YOU FOR FROM BRING IT FORWARD. QUESTIONS COMMENTS CENTER WHITE HOUSE. YEAH. CAN WE DIRECT. OUR ATTENTION TO PAGE EIGHT WITHIN THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT GOES ON BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT CODIFICATION OF THE- COURT RULES WERE ALSO EXPANDING IT. TO T. R. ROSE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS STAFF ANALYSIS SAYS IT HEROES THERE'S NO NOTICE TO THIS PERSON. SIX ONE ONE THING IT'S EMERGENCY. BUT IT'S ONE THING TO SAY. YES THEY WAY I CAN ORDER AND THEN THE SHERIFF WILL SERVE THEM. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO SAY THAT THEY'VE GOT TWO DAYS TO. GET RID OF ALL THEIR GUNS. ARE AND RELINQUISH THEM HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT PROBLEM. I NOTICED. THAT KNOWS WHAT I MEAN I THINK THE CHAIR HASPOINTED OUT WE I WOULD TAKES OFFENSE AT THIS HASN'T BEEN A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I THINK IT'S BEEN A TOUGH APPROACH AND IT COMES WITH SOME URGENCY AND I HAVE CERTAINLY SAID THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS INTO WE CAN GET ALL THE ISSUES RESOLVED TO TAKE IT FORWARD I DON'T THINK. ANYBODY ARGUES pCOMMUTING ABUSE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR GUNS BUT I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE THAT IT WOULD BE HARD THEN TO NOTICE THEM TO HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE SO YEAH IT'S THE IT'S THE DUE PROCESS YOU KNOW THEY THEY MAY BE BAD ACTORS THEY MAY BE VIOLENT THEY MAY HAVE UNREGISTERED ALL THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THE LEAPS WHEN WE DO BILLS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BACKSTOPS IS THE DUE PROCESS WERE FINE WE'VE ALL TRAINED IN IN THE LAW TO SAY YOU GIVE THAT PERSON NOTICE BEFORE THEIR CORE INCLUDE IN VIOLATION OF THIS NEW STATUTES. FOR JUST PROCESS NOT THAT I MEAN MAYBE THE INCIDENT YOU HAVE YOUR WITNESS WILL TELL HAS SAID HERE THAT THERE'S INCIDENTS OF A 5100% INCREASE IN MURDERS AND VIOLENCE I GOT THAT I GOT. THAT BUT STILL WE'RE A STATE OF RULES. RULES THAT HAVE FALLEN. CENTER I DON'T THINK THAT AND I TOTALLY AGREE AND WE HAVE FOUGHT VERY HARD IN THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE DUE PROCESS AND NOTICE AND ALL THOSE FUNDAMENTAL. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO MAINTAIN. I DON'T THINK THAT THE- JUDGES AND THAT THE- JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WOULD ALLOW. ANY KIND OF. SEATING WITHOUT THAT INHERENT TO PROCESS THAT'S THE WE'VE SORT OF GOT A ROAD MAP HERE AND THE SUGGESTION AND I KNOW HAVING TALKED TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE WILL CONTINUE TO FILL THE SAN. WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND I AND I THINK THERE IS A DESIRE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE COURTS AND IS A FRAMEWORK. AND I DON'T THINK FRANKLY THERE'S A CORD THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD FIND SOMEONE IN CRIMINAL CONTEMPT OR WOULD WOULD. HAVE ANY KIND OF CRIMINAL OR EVEN. IN A CIVIL CASE OF COURT ANY KIND OF CONSEQUENCE WITHOUT THAT NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT JUST A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. SO IT'S- ARE YOU COULD ARGUE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPLICIT IN THIS BECAUSE IT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL BUT CERTAINLY WORKING ON THIS GOING FORWARD. TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. SO HOW WOULD THAT HAPPEN. IF I CAN JUST POP IN TO TRY TO HELP CLARIFY OKAY. HEAR ME I'M I THE INTENTION I BELIEVE BEHIND THE LANGUAGE IS NOT TO FIND SOMEBODY IN VIOLATION BEFORE THEY'VE RECEIVED NOTICE BUT THE EXISTING RULES ALREADY ABOUT FIREARM RELINQUISHMENT. DIRECTOR THAT ONCE A RESTRAINED PERSON HAS BEEN SERVED WITH THE TEMPORARY ORDER SO THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN NOTICE THAT IS WHEN THEY HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS. TO FILE A FORM AND USUALCOUNSEL WITH THE FORM CONFIRMING THAT THEY HAVE DONE SO THAT THEY HAVE COMPLIED WITH THAT RULE SO WE'RE NOT THE INTENTION BEHIND THIS IS NOT. TO HOPE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IN CONTEMPT OF A COURT ORDER WHEN THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT COURT ORDER. AS MENTOR POINTED OUT THAT'S THE GOAL THE REASON THAT I EIGHT ONE OF THE REASONS TO INCLUDE T. R. ROSE AS PART OF THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE I T. RO MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FAMILY COURT SETTING ON AN EX PARTE BASIS. AND THEN THE PARTIES MAY COME TO THE FIRST NOTICED HEARING AND LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE. THEY COME TO THAT HEARING IT GETS CONTINUED FOR SOME REASON BEFORE IT'S HEARD ON THE MERITS. THE T. R. O. IS RE ISSUED AT THAT POINT IT'S CONTINUE. SO WE DON'T AND WE WANTED TO TRY TO CLOSE OF A POSSIBILITY WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE A CONTINUANCE OF A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. BUT YOU HAVEN'T DEALT RIGHT THERE AT THAT FIRST YEAR WHERE BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN NOTICED AND HAVE APPEARED. WITH THE- PARTY HAS REALLY WHICH THEIR FIREARMS BECAUSE THE EARLIEST THE EARLIEST POINT IN THE PROCESS WE CAN ADDRESS THIS. DESI FOR WE MAKE VICTIMS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE INCLUDING OUR PEACE OFFICERS. ONE OF THE CHOICE OF. AGAIN LEGISLATION COMES IN LATE THERE'S. THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AMENDMENTS BUT I DO BELIEVE I THINK IT'S JUST FUNDAMENTAL THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE NOTICE I MEAN YOU AND THAT I THINK WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT ANY COURT. IF IT ISN'T IT SPELLED OUT IT WILL GETS BILLS THAT BUT I THINK IT AS A LEGITIMATE NOTICE THE RIGHT ONCE YOU GET THE RESTRAINING ORDER YOU CAN ORDER IT SAYS AND ON AN EX PARTE I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SERVE THE PERSON THAT'S REQUIREMENT IN ANY ACT PART BEATING THAT YOU CAN GET IT WITHOUT THERE. BEING PRESSED. BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO CERTAIN. CHALLENGE YOUR PLAN I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON IS. IN A FAMILY LAW MATTER WE KNOW THAT MOST. FAMILY LAW LITIGANTS ARE IMPROPER MEANING THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT. OF AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE BUT WE DO HAVE JUDGES AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL. BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME. OF RULES IN SOME PROCEDURES. WHERE THE COURTS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK TO DO BUT- THIS WILL SAVE LIVES AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE- THE URGENCY OF THIS ITEM. SENATOR I'M GONNA SO IF YOU'LL INDULGE MY NEWNESS TARDINESS AND IGNORANCE I'D BE GRATEFUL. I HEARD WHAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN GEORGIA SO SEE SHE HAD TO SAY I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY THE ISSUE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE- IT SOLD OVER TILL JANUARY BUT IF WE HADN'T URGENCY CLAUSE. IN PASSED IN JANUARY I REALIZE THAT THE LAYS IT FOR THREE MONTHS. BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME AMBIGUITY THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED WHAT. I WAS I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. I THINK YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD NOW AND THEN IN JANUARY AND HAVING TIME OVER THE OVER THE BREAK IN YOUR WORK. NEEDS TO STILL GO BACK TO THE OTHER HOUSE AND- YOU'RE STILL THERE'S STILL TIME TO GET THESE ISSUES RECTIFIED I THINK AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT WITH URGENCY BECAUSE IT CAN BE A LOT. SOONER BECAUSE- AGAIN WE DON'T GET IT STARTED AND THEN WE HAVE LONGER TO EIGHT IN JANUARY TO START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. AND I SURE DIDN'T SAVE. AN ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT. CAN GO ON ABOUT. POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY SOMEBODY WHO SHOULD HAVE RELINQUISHED THEIR FIREARMS. AND I HAD IS THE CASE. WE CAN HALF AGO. WE'RE SOMEBODY WAS THAT PERSON WITH A RESTRAINING ORDER SHOWED UP. AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME A SCHOOL TEACHER THE WHOLE SCHOOL ETIQUETTE SHUT DOWN. AND THE PERPETRATOR WITH ENDED UP BEING SHOT AND KILLED BECAUSE YOU POINT THE GUN AT THE POLICE WHEN THEY SHOWED UP. AGAIN YOU KNOW IT HAS IMPACTS THAT REVERBERATE ACROSS THE COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY. NOT TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY WITH THEM WHEN THEY SHOW UP. WHAT THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION SO YOU'RE GOING TO. LOWERIT'S GOING TO GO OVER TO JANUARY AND WE'RE MOVING FROM MOVE FORWARD TODAY RIGHT TIME TO PICK BUT THEN. AND YOU'RE YOU'RE CONSIDERING AND URGENCY CLAUSE. THANK YOU. ONE FINAL QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT THAT INSIGHT INTO THE PROCESS. TRAGIC SITUATION A MAJOR GAP I'M JUST TRYING TO DRILL DOWN YOU IS THIS JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE JUDGES CONCERNED ABOUT YOU PROCESS RESOURCE. IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SORT OF. THERE'S TWO THINGS BEING TALKED BUT HERE IS WHAT I'M HEARING IS NOTICE REQUIREMENT AND DUE PROCESS IS YOU SEEM TO BE BUILT ON THE EXISTING. SERVICE WHAT IS THE CONCERNED MORE ABOUT WHAT THE SORT OF. ANCILLARY PROCEDURES WILL BE AND WHAT THAT WOULD TRIGGER ADMINISTRATIVELY MORE SO THAN THE- UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS THERE ARE ALSO DUE PROCESS CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NO CURRENT AUTHORITY IN THE LAW TO SERVE SOMEONE. BY EMAIL THAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A VALID METHOD OF SERVICE THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BE THE FIRST BILL TO ENACT WITHOUT SOMEONE PROVIDING CONSENT SPECIFICALLY THAT TYPE OF SERVICE. FIND THAT EMAIL THEMSELVES AWAY THAT YOU WOULD NOTICE SOMEONE OF A LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH THEY MIGHT BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT IS SUBJECT IS CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. BY EMAIL AT THEIR LAST KNOWN EMAIL ADDRESS THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT AND THAT THAT IS A SERIES DEPRIVE THIS CONCERN WE HAVE WHAT WE DO. IF THE PERSON SAYS WHY CERTAIN BY HUMAN EMAIL DOESN'T SHOW UP AT THE HEARING. SHOULD THEY BE HOLDING OUT HIS HAND SHOULD THEY BE SUBJECTED THEM TO SANCTIONS THOSE YEARS. IN ADDITION WE ARE CONCERNED THAT. THERE WILL BE A VOLUME OF THIS AND THAT AMBIGUITY. LEAD TO A LOT OF UNNECESSARY PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THIRTY ABOUT WHEN THIS HAPPENS AN EXTRA TIME. IN PROVING THE NEGATIVE THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE A FIRE IN BASED ON THE FINDINGS LANGUAGE. NO I DON'T WORK AGAINST MYSELF HERE BUT WE DO HAVE LEGISLATION THAT I BELIEVE IT'S PASSED BOTH HOUSES THAT. LOOKS AT DIGITAL SERVICE PROCESS AND. YOU CAN TELL WHEN SOMEONE'S BRED AN EMAIL SO I HOPE IT'S SOMETHING THAT. YOU GUYS START TO LOOK INTO BUT I WE DO HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE WE JUST DON'T HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE IT IS JUST. WITHOUT THE TYPICALLY AND IT'S BEEN A THE LEGISLATURE'S. REQUIREMENT THAT IT IS AT THE CONSENT OF THE PERSON BEING SERVED THAT WE WANT PEOPLE OPT IN EMAIL SERVICE. WHAT ROUTE WENT BEFORE WE TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE. THANK YOU FOR BEING THIS BORDER SIMILAR. YES OF SENATOR RUSSELL. I JUST WANT TO ASK IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC PROCESS. THERE IS A FORM THAT USED RIGHT FROM. JUST EXPLAIN THE PROCESS OF WHEN THE EXPECTED TO TURN IN THEIR FIREARMS BECAUSE OF THE WHAT IS A FORM OF PROOF OF FIREARMS TURNED IN SOLAR STORM SO I'M I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFUSED AS TO WHEN. THE PROBLEM OCCURS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT. DOES THAT WARM EXIST WHO USES IT WHEN IS IT USE IS BEING QUITE. THANK YOU YEAH I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AND-I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T QUITE LOOK AT YOU AND TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE AT THE SAME TIME SO. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS YES THERE IS A FORMER BELIEVE IT'S A DV EIGHT HUNDRED TO JUDICIAL CUSTODY Y. JUDICIAL COUNCIL FORM THAT THE RESTRAINT PARTY IS SUPPOSED TO USE IN ORDER TO NOTIFY THE COURT THAT THEY HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE RELINQUISHMENT REQUIREMENT AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE WITH THAT. A RECEIPT I PROVING THAT THEY TURNED THE FIREARMS INTO EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TO A LICENSED GUN DEALER. I'M IT'S NOT BEING USED IS THE REALITY IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES ONCE THE RESTRAINT PARTY IS SERVED WHILE I'M WITH NOTICE OF THE HEARING AND THE RESTRAINING ORDER THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER THAT ADVISES THEM THAT THEY NEED TO RELINQUISH THEIR FIREARMS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT THEY NEED TO FILL THIS FORM OUT. THEY'RE JUST NOT DOING IT THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY NEED TO ABIDE BY THE- ORDER. BECAUSE DON'T SIMPLY DON'T READ THE RESTRAINING ORDER PAPERWORK. SOLD BABE THEY JUST DON'T COMPLY AND WHAT IS THIS. FORM SUPPOSED TO BE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS ALWAYS MUST BE SUBMITTED BUT WHEN AND THEN THE TWO PARTIES GO BEFORE THE JUDGE THIS JUST AS THE JUDGE TO ASK DID YOU TURN IN THAT PAPERWORK DO YOU HAVE THAT PROOF. THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE MISSING LINK THAT WERE ASKING FOR. THE LAW ALREADY EXISTED THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. BUT IF NOBODY ASKS THE PERSON AND THE JUDGES THE BACKSTOPS. CASE THAT'S WHO THEY'RE GOING BEFORE. SO THIS IS A FORM THAT WILL HELP THEM PROVE. THAT TURNED IN SO THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM MAYBE. THE CHALLENGES WE. IF THE COURT HAS KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT THE RULE DOES ADVISED. QUESTION IS THERE'S LOTS OF SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF THE RESTRAINT PERSON HAS A FIREARM SO YOU'RE SENDING A HEARING FOR SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T. GONNA READ THE PAPER WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE AND YOU EXPECT THAT THEY'RE IN A READ THE THING THAT YOU SOMETHING ABOUT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD A HEARING IT IF THEY DON'T READ IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME AND THEN THE- BUILDING A HEARING. NO WONDER FOR THE BECAUSE OF TECH PERSON IS NOT ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE AT THAT HEARING TO DO YOU KNOW TO ASK IF I THINK IT'S BEEN RELINQUISH THE BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHEN THE PARTIES ARE IN COURT I THINK IF THIS. LEGISLATION WERE LIMITED TO THE TIMES WHEN THE RESTRAINT THIS IS ACTUALLY APPEARING BEFORE THE COURT THAT'S MAKING IN FOLLOW UP WOULD BE FAR. LESS CONCERNING BREAST AND WANTED OF. EVERY SINGLE CASE. THOUGH THAT'S A DISCUSSION THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF PEOPLE DON'T. WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE RECOGNIZE THE WE HAVE A COURT PROCESS IN THE COURT SYSTEM WE DON'T WANT TO REWARD THEM. I MEAN THE TRUTH OF MOTHER THE REAL PROBLEM IS COURT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING. OF BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD. AND TO THE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME COOL SHOULD HAVE SELF HELP PROGRAMS IT REALLY CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE. BUT THAT ISN'T THE ISSUE HERE THE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT WHOWHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED. PROPENSITY TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR WHO HAVE FIREARMS TO RULE REMOVE THOSE FIREARMS FROM THEIR POSSESSION BECAUSE WE KNOW IS THOSE STAGGERING NUMBERS. INDICATED WHAT IS IT OF. OVER HALF OF THE VICTIMS OF MURDER VICTIMS HALF THE WOMEN WERE MURDERED IN THIS COUNTRY ARE MURDERED BY AN INTIMATE PARTNER WHO WHO KILL SOME OF THE FIREARM. THOUSANDS OF. I MEAN IT'S STUCK SO WE CAN REMOVE THOSE FARM SAID SHE ULTIMATE GOAL I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. GETTING THROUGH THAT PROCESS IN A WAY UNDERSTANDING. THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT GOING TO COMPLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ON THE OTHER HAND THERE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE READING IS IT IN A LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTAND IT. DOES THE COURT NO CAN WE TRY O SET UP SOME PROCEDURES SO THAT THE COURT CAN THEN NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT. I MEAN THERE'S THERE THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT THIS BILL WILL AT LEAST FORCE US TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS. OF THE FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BEFORE THE A CJ SO THAT WE CAN GET SOME ANSWERS AND ALSO BEFORE THE. IN A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND OTHER AGENCIES WHICH MIGHT HAVE THEIR OWN. THOUGHTS ON ON HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOA. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR I'M SORRY I JUST A QUICK QUESTION I MISSED THE BOUNCING BALL BETWEEN CENTER NUMBER AGAIN ASSEMBLY WOMAN REGARDING NEXT YOU COMING BACK NEXT YEAR WITH URGENCY CLAUSE I UNDERSTOOD CENTER UMBERG'S COMMENTS TO MEAN WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE BILL HERE AND COME BACK. JANUARY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT'S IF SOMEBODY COULD JUST EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING IN JANUARY VERSES WHAT WE'RE DOING TODA. SELECT MY UNDERSTANDING THE BILL WOULD KNOW FOR OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT WOULD BE THEN RE REFER TO THE NEXT PLACE WHERE THEN WE WOULD HOLD IT IN WORK ON UNTIL JANUARY WHAT WE'LL CALL COME BACK TO SESSION. ALL THROUGH THE BREAK WE'LL ALL BE WORKING TOGETHER WE HAVE A SOUNDS LIKE A VERY FIRM COMMITMENT. AMONG THE PARTIES TO WORK ON THIS BILL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS REACHED OUT TO US ALSO AND SAID THEY WOULD LIE TO ENGAGE ON THIS. SO WE THINK YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME WE'LL GET IT JUST RIGHT. AND THEN WITH A NURSE TO CLASS BE ABLE TO CLOSE IT OUT EARLY NEXT YEAR AND MAKE IT LAW. NOT INTENDING TO BRING IT TO THE SENATE FOR. THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. OKAY. WELL I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM THERE. IS THE- MOTIONS TO PASS TO SET IT TO THE SENATE FLOOR. WE COULD HOLD ELDER. SO IS THAT YOUR IS THAT YOUR DESIRE WOULD BE MY DESIRE RIGHT TO WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR WE HAVE AGREEMENT FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WORK WITH ALL THE STATE BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. IT IS COMPLICATED BY CERTAIN DIFFERENCES TRYING TO APPLY A CRIMINAL. OF PROCESS TO A CIVIL MATTER WHERE IN THE CIVIL MATTER YOU'VE LIKELY DON'T HAVE COUNSELORS IN THE CRIMINAL MATTER YOU DO. BUT WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THIS RESOLVED SO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. NO JUST THA I THINK I THINK THE DISCUSSION HAS HAS. IS PROCEEDING ALONG AS AS A I THINK THE CHAIR IN THE LAST COMMITTEE SAID AS A AS A WOMAN I HAVE MORE I AM MOST LIKELY TO BE MURDERED BY SOMEBODY. AND IN AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I DON'T THINK. TOO HARD FOR US TO SOLVE. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND BE ABLE TO SELL. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MADAM SECRETARY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS RUSSELL RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES JONES I'M MONNING MONEY AYE STERN STERN AYE AMBER AMBER I WHITE HOUSE SKI.
