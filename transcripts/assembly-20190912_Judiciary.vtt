WHICH THE DEPICTED INDIVIDUAL

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.220

YOU'VE MISSED ONE WHICH IS

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:14.673

PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DEPICTED

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:24.916
INDIVIDUAL AND I DON'T THINK

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:26.351
THAT THAT WOULD CAUSE COUNT IS

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:27.619
BEING COMPUTER GENERATED

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:29.287
BECAUSE WAS ACTUALLY DONE BY A

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:31.356
HUMAN. SO I JUST JUST THOUGHT I

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.891
POINT THAT OUT NOW I APPRECIATE

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:34.159
THAT AND WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.460
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE

00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:36.361
IT'S ALL TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.662
CHANGES EITHER BUT I WOULD NOT

00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:39.597
ADVISE IT NO IT WOULD CAN COULD

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:40.899
DO TO CLEAN UP LEGISLATION IF

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.033
NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE ALL

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.401
RIGHT PROUD THAT. AND THEN ONE

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.903
QUESTION THAT I DID HAVE

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.371
CONCERNS OF THE SECTION OF THE

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.940
BILL THAT. CREATE SOME

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:50.075
EXEMPTIONS AND SAYS PERSONS NOT

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:51.710
LIABLE UNDER THE SECTION UNDER

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.611
THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES IN

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:56.748
ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IS.

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.783
BUT IF THE MATERIAL IS A WORK

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.018
OF POLITICAL OR NEWS WORTHY

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.287
VALUE. SO I'M JUST WONDERING

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:05.056
THAT THE POLITICAL VALUE KIND

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:08.927
OF RAISE MY EYEBROW SO. I MEAN

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:09.527
IF YOUR COMPETITOR IN THE NEXT

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:12.464
ELECTION. RATED ONE OF THESE

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.064
DEFECTS I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:13.698
BILL ON THAT BUT AND POSTED IT

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:14.632
AND SAID AND CLAIMED THAT IT

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.768
WAS A POLITICAL VALUE TO THEM

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:17.369
WITH THAT EXEMPT THEM FROM THE

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:20.705
REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. TO

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.440
THE CHAIR I THOUGHT WE DON'T

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.342
VIEW THAT AS SOMETHING THAT

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:25.510
WOULD EXEMPT THEM FROM THE BILL

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:28.546
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF. OF

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.015
THE PRODUCT THAT'S CREATED HERE

00:27:30.081 --> 00:27:31.249
WHICH IS SEXUALLY EXPLICIT

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:34.252
MATERIAL. EIGHT HR VIEW THAT

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.689
THAT WOULDN'T. ADDRESS SOME OF

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.624
THE ISSUES THAT YORK YOUR-

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.060
WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES I

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.162
THINK THERE ARE THE AS ASSEMBLY

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:45.697
MEMBER BERMAN SAID THERE IT

00:27:45.764 --> 00:27:47.399
OTHER LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:50.435
THAT ISSUE. ON WHICH WE AGREE A

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:51.269
SIGNIFICANT BUT THAT'S NOT THE

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.238
INTENT OF THIS BILL TO COVER

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:55.306
ABOUT SECULAR TYPE OF

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:55.907
EXPRESSION IF THAT IS THE CASE

00:27:55.974 --> 00:27:58.276
THEN. WHAT IS MEANT TO BE

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.279
EXEMPTED BY. ONE THE BILL SAYS

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:05.884
A WORK OF POLITICAL VALUE. WELL

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.652
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOR A

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:10.221
FOR A COURT TO DECIDE ARE AT

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:12.057
FOLKS THAT WE WORKED WITH UP

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:14.059
PRIOR TO THE BILL'S

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:16.861
INTRODUCTION WE HAD ENGAGE WITH

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:19.097

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:25.336
BEGAN IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:27.072
LEGISLATION. AND THAT WAS ONE

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:28.840
OF THE SUGGESTED EXEMPTIONS

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.775
THAT THAT THEY SAID WE SHOULD

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:32.477
ANSWERED IN THIS BILL FOR

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.179
PROTECTION CONSTITUTIONALLY IF

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:35.613
IT WAS EVER REVIEWED BY A

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.918
COURT. SO I THINK OF THAT'S WHY

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:40.485
THAT EXEMPTION IS IN THERE I

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:42.554
CAN. THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.022
BE UP TO A COURT TO DECIDE

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:45.723
EVENTUALLY IF SOMEONE MAKES

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.758
THAT CLAIM THAT IT WAS A

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.827
POLITICAL EXPRESSION THAT I.

00:28:48.893 --> 00:28:51.329
PUT SOMEBODY'S IMAGE THAT WAS

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:54.232
ALTERED ON THE INTERNET. WE'LL

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.467
HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE COURT SAID

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:56.601
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF

00:28:56.668 --> 00:28:57.502
THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:58.837
REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:00.805
DOING IT AND A VERY NARROWLY

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:02.407
TAILORED WAY TO AVOID FIRST

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.643
AMENDMENT. THEIR CONCERNS AND

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.012
VIOLATIONS BUT IT'S A GOOD

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:10.148
POINT AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:11.382
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO ALSO

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:13.017
SURE I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.120
NOT. TRYING NOT TO EXPOSE

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:17.388
SOMEONE TO LIABILITY UNDER

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:20.058
FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS BUT- IT

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.493
I HATE TO SEE YOU KNOW

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.261
EXEMPTION THAT BROAD PUT IN

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.295
THERE BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:25.096
IMAGINE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:26.331
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SOMEONE

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:27.565
COULD SAY ALL THAT THAT HAS

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.100
POLITICAL VALUE FOR SURE AND I

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:32.203
BUT THAT THANK YOU FOR

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:32.804
ANSWERING QUESTIONS CERTAINLY

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:33.338
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL.

THANK YOU SIR. GIVE OTHER

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:37.108
QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I THINK

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:37.709
THIS RUBBER OUT THE REYES ONE

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:40.278
OF THE- ISSUES THAT'S REALLY AT

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.412
THE HEART OF THIS AND A NUMBER

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.047
OF THINGS THAT. WHILE WE LOOK

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:46.751
AT WHAT WE CAN SEE I THINK MOST

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:47.285
PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE IS

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:49.721
PRETTY OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOR. IN

00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:51.089
THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ALSO

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.191
ABOUT CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:53.825
AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:57.395
DEVELOPED OVER TIME. BY. THINGS

00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.298
THAT THAT ARE OFFENSIVE BUT

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:01.799
WHEN WE BUMP UP AGAINST FREE

00:30:01.866 --> 00:30:04.068
SPEECH RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.770
ESPECIALLY THE POLITICAL ROUND

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.505
IT GETS TO BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:09.174
THIS COUNTRY HAS LONG AND I

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.408
THINK A PROPERLY PROTECTED

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.677
POLITICAL SPEECH IS THE HIGHEST

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:13.244
FORM OF SPEECH. THAT'S THERE

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:16.281
AND- FOR AS LONG AS THIS

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.715
COUNTRY'S BEEN ENGAGED IN

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:18.716
POLITICS THERE ARE BAD

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:20.752
OFFENSIVE ADVERTISEMENTS

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.921
DRAWINGS POLITICAL CARTOONS.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.323
THAT CAST POLITICIANS IN VERY

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.492
UNFAVORABLE LIGHTS RIGHT NOW

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:28.259
THOSE TOOLS AS YOU CORRECTLY

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:31.863
POINT OUT ARE. MUCH EASIER AND

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.164
MUCH MORE AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:34.899
TO BE ABLE TO GRAB. GRAB

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.534
SCREENSHOTS RENDER THEM

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.770
DIFFERENTLY BE ABLE TO MOVE AND

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:41.039
DRAW IN PRETTY REALISTIC

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:43.808
REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS BODY

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:44.876
PARTS THAT THAT AREN'T THERE

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.377
AND IN FACT ACTIONS AND

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:48.746
ACTIVITIES. GIVEN THE POWERS OF

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.881
THE COMPUTERS THAT DIDN'T

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.983

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.990
CAREFUL. IN TRYING TO CONSTRUCT

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:01.159
PROTECT PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY BUT

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:02.327
HOW WE CONSTRUCT THOSE

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:04.195

TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT. IT ARE

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.535
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND

00:31:10.602 --> 00:31:11.669
