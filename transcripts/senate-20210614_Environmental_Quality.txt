SECOND AND THIRD WORST IN THE NATION TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND REDUCE EMISSIONS WE MUST HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN FORMER GOVERNOR EDMUND G.

THIS IS AN INSTITUTE THAT EXPLICITLY WORKS IN CALIFORNIA AND WORKS WITH CHINESE PROVINCES THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES ABOUT CHOI A LOT OF ISSUES- AND PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND RIGHTLY SO BUT- CHINA IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO GLOBAL WARMING BUT HE MUST IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL REDUCE.

OKAY WHAT'S BRING THE BOTTOM BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR DISCUSSION NOW WILL GO TO U. S. SENATE DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS SO I HAVE A QUESTIONS- THE AUTHOR. IN IN CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF WHEN CHINA'S EVER AGAIN- I GUESTS BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR STATE THAT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY. LISTEN TO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN AND THROUGH THE PARIS ACCORD OR ANY OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW DONE WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GONNA DO AND IN MY OPINION- YEAH THEY THEY TALK A GOOD GAME BUT- THE PIRATE OUR INFORMATION THEY- POLLUTE LIKE CRAZY AS WE LOOK. REGULATE CALIFORNIANS AND AMERICANS AND IT NATIONALLY THEY TAKE OUR JOBS AND THEY POLLUTE OUR AIR SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY. ABIDE BY SOME SORT OF THE BINDING I GUESS I'LL BINDING IS A SUCH A DIFFERENT KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHY DO WHY DO WE NEED THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER ICE I THINK THIS IS- NOT A BINDING. AGREEMENT AND ANY ANY FORM IT IS A- IT IS A PARTNERSHIP. BUILT BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A THINK TANK. KIND OF A SET UP. AND IT'S DUE TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK LAW. YOU MAY RECALL THAT- EARLIER IN A POLL ON. HOW CLIMATE ENVOY- JOHN KERRY HAD A MEETING WITH ONE OF THE HIGHER UPS IN CHINA I. DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE GENTLEMAN. WHO JOINTLY ISSUED A STATEMENT TO. COLLABORATE ON THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE. AND THIS IS PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING- THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTIFYING ISSUES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH CHINA ON. A WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE- CHINA HAS TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION AS I STATED EARLIER- DAY CURRENTLY IN MAY 28% OF THE WORLD'S CARBON DIOXIDE AND THAT'S THE KIND OF. A STEP THAT WE BREATHE IN EVERY DAY. SO THE SOONER THAT WE COULD GET CHINA TO DROP THAT NUMBER DOWN FROM TWENTY PERCENT. THE SOONER WE CAN BREATHE CLEANER AIR. SO TO DATA THE INTENT UP BECAUSE- WE NEED. TO WORK WITH THEM SO THAT THEY COULD. HI SENSUALLY YOU'LL GET THEIR NUMBER DOWN AND DATE THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN DOING THIS AS WELL. BUT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS LOCATED SO CLOSE TO. TO CHINA I THINK WE BEAR THE BRUNT AND I THINK YOU KNOW COMPARED TO OTHER STATES SO WE HAVE A E. NO EVEN A STRONGER INTEREST. IT GETTING THEIR NUMBER DOWN. RIGHT AS WELL AS OUR NUMBER SO. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH PARTIES TO. CONTINUE THIS KIND OF COLLABORATION I DO UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW. AT THE HAS THE GOVERNOR SAID CHINA MAY HAVE ISSUES AND POLICIES THAT WE DON'T ALL AGREE WITH. BUT BUT YET THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T. FOCUS AND ALL IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT WE CAN WORK WITH HIM ON AND THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM. AND TOP. CIVIL BOB SO WE NEED TO KEEP DOING THOSE OF BECAUSE- IN A WEEK YEAH THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA'S CONCERN. SO THIS IS IT YOU KNOW THE BILL CENTENAS TO. HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE IS TO HAS BEEN DOING NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO TO DEMONSTRATE THE FACT THAT WE SHOULD BILL PUNISHES WITH PEOPLE ACROSS YOU KNOW. ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND YOU KNOW- THROUGHOUT THE WORLD SO THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE COULD CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW. TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN I MEAN I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION. SO I WOULD. I AGREE THE FAT THAT THEY ARE BLUE. I NO DOUBT ABOUT IT AND WE'RE BREED IT WE WILL EXPLORE MOST OF OUR MANY JOBS IN AMERICA IN CALIFORNIA TO THEM AS THEY CONTINUE TO POLLUTE IT SO. MY POINT IS. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DO WITH THESE OTHER GUYS A COMMUNIST COUNTRY THAT SLAVES THERE. THERE'S NOT LIKE WE'RE TALKING TO CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THESE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO- DON'T HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS WE HAVE HERE. AND THEY THEY HAVE NOT IT DEMONSTRATED. IN ANY EVENT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COMPLY WITH ANYTHING THEY TALK THEY'LL SHOW UP THE TABLE BUT WHEN THEY GO HOME. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING THEY'RE THEY'RE POLLUTING OUR AIR. THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS THERE THERE THERE'S STUFF THEY DO TO PEOPLE IS. ATROCIOUS AND SO I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO. USE TALK A GOOD GAME HERE BUT NOT BUT IT DOESN'T END UP WITH THE OUTCOME WE WANT. AND WE'RE JUST PROMOTING THEM TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND CONTROL OUR COUNTY AYE. I'M REBUILDING AN ENGINE IN A TRACTOR RIGHT NOW AND I WAITED. THREE WEEKS FOR PARTS. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY. IN CHINA. DOMINO SHOULDN'T WE IF CHINA WANTS TO TAKE AMERICA DOWN ALL YOU GOTTA DO STOP MAKING BEARINGS AND WE'RE OUT WE'RE DONE BECAUSE WE DON'T MANUFACTURE MERE. AND SO THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR FRIENDS. SO FOR THE FOR THAT AND MANY REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS THIS IS BINDING US. I WITH SENATOR ROBERT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT STRENGTHENING THEIR ECONOMY IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE'S A GLOBAL CRISIS ON OUR HANDS AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE REGIME. IN THE CCP WHICH AND I'M AND I SHARE A LOT OF YOUR CONCERNS TO BE HONEST- BUT WE WORKED WITH WITH COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT HAVE ENGAGING. IN PRACTICES THAT WE DON'T APPROVE OF WHICH WE DON'T APPROVE- THE WE WORK WITH THEM BECAUSE WE SHARE MUTUAL INTERESTS ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. HI THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THE CHINESE ECONOMY HERE I HELP THEM IN ANY WAY BEYOND OUR MUTUALLY SHARED INTEREST IN TRYING TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SO ON YEAH BYE HI I JUST OF MY MAKE AYE AYE AYE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAID I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FOR THE FOLKS ARE WATCHING. THERE'S CLARITY AS TO WHAT'S BEING. PROPOSED HERE WITH THIS. BUT THIS BILL WILL FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIRMAN. I'LL SAY THIS. WE'RE THE ONLY ONES. MAINLY CALIFORNIA EVEN THE UNITED STATES THE COMPLY WITH ALL THE STUFF IS HAPPENING. AND WHAT IS IT DOING TO OUR ECONOMY IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF FUEL IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF ELECTRICITY. DRIVING UP THE COST OF LIVING ALL THOSE INJURED. AND WE CANNOT GET THE- PARTS WE CAN'T GET THE PIECES A STEP THAT WE NEED TO MAKE AMERICA RUN. AND SO I WILL JUST TELL YOU WERE THE ONLY ONES COMPLY NOBODY ELSE COMPLAINING ALL OF OURS JUST THIS IS NOT GONNA. BUT THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO GET HOUSE AGAIN HOW YOU GONNA FORCE THEM. TO DO SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DOING. SACRIFICES HAPPEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE FOR ABSOLUTE NOT IF WE DON'T GET OTHER COUNTRIES AND MAC POWERFUL ECONOMIES LIKE CHINA ON BOARD. THE EFFORT AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY POINT THEY DON'T EVER DO IT THOUGH. YOU'RE RIGHT WAS ARCHES ARE TWELVE. INCH EACH AND I ASK FOR EXAMPLES OF WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT. AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANY- THERE WERE- AT THE TABLE. I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO. YOU KNOW JUST I. FIVE DAYS YOU WANT TO BE. OF YOUR QUESTIONS MEAN IT'S YOU KNOW THAT THEIR- THERE'S A- OF. RIGHT NOW IN CHINA ON TRYING TO TRANSITION THEIR ECONOMY TOWARD. CLEANER FUELS. AND THEY'VE GOT A MASSIVE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE THEY- THEY RECOGNIZE MORE THAN ANYONE THAT THERE IS A HUGE. HUGE PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS OF THE GUARDS TO POLLUTION- THERE'S A WHOLE PIECE AND- NOT TOO LONG AGO. IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT HOW IT'S CHILD ABUSE TO RAISE YOUR KID IN BEIJING BECAUSE OUTSIDE THE AREAS- SO. THAT THEIR DAY BUT THERE'SA THERE'S A THERE'S A STRONG RECOGNITION OF THEIR NEED TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM- AND- YOU KNOW I JUST THINK. YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I WILL I YOU KNOW I'D. WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE BUT- IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS A POWERFUL. SOVEREIGN NATION- AND OUR OUR PLAN IT REALLY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY. TO WORK WITH THEM. TO HAVE TO PUSH THEM. TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES AND THAT'S REALLY ALL THIS IS DOING I COULD OFFER UP A WAY TO DO THAT. LET'S MANUFACTURE CLEAN GOOD JOBS HERE IN AMERICANS BE SELF SUSTAINING. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO. HAVE THEM USE THEIR SLAVES. TO PROP DID GET THE PRODUCTS WE NEED AND ALSO PUT HER AT THE SAME TIME. YEP YEP WELL I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU AND I LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON GETTING GOOD GREEN JOBS HERE IN. CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES. SENATE GONZALEZ. S. THANK YOU AND- I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M OF THAT THAT- IDEA THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BRING FORWARD I MEAN. THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING AS YOU MENTIONED HIGHLIGHTING COLLABORATION JOINT POLICY RESEARCH PROVIDING TRAINING CALIFORNIANS. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF- VISITING THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR THE CITY OF LONG BEACH REPRESENTING THE PORT. HAVING SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY. AND STILL FINDING DIALOGUE REALLY REALLY FRUITFUL AMONG- CHINESE ACADEMICS FOR ME AS A CALIFORNIAN WAS HELPFUL SO I THINK THAT LEVELING THIS UP EVEN MORE SO IN THAT RESPECT IS SOMETHING THAT I LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING AND- AS THE NEW CHAIR TRANSPORTATION ALSO- HAPPY THAT TO CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH YOU AND- WOULD LOVE TO YOU KNOW. A AND SURE THAT WE MOVE THIS THROUGH AND- AND HELP IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN TO PROMOTE TO PUT. YOU KNOW DIPLOMACY IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT ALSO- CREATE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH INTEGRITY WHICH I KNOW IS THE INTENT OF THIS THANK YOU. BAKER CENTER- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU IF YOU IF WE MAY I IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN. I WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS I'M BASED ON. SOME OF THE DISCUSSION PLEASE. YEAH I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE SENATOR. FIRST OF ALL THE REASON WHY THESE JOBS ARE BEING EXPORTED IS NOT BECAUSE CHINA TOOK THEM. BUT AMERICAN BUSINESSES. THOSE JOBS AWAY TO GET CHEAPER WORKERS. AND OPPOSE POLICIES THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. TO WORK WITH BUSINESS BY LOWERING THE COST OF CAPITAL THE KEEPING THE JOBS HERE. SO THIS IS AMERICAN POLICY UNDER BOTH PARTIES THAT TO SEND JOBS AWAY. NOT ONLY CHINA BUT THE MEXICO AND OTHER PLACES. THAT PUT AMERICANS OUT OF WORK TO MAKE MORE BUCKS- FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS SO LET'S. CALL IT THE AY IT IS THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO- CHINA HAS WORKED WITH US ON THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL- THEY- WORK THOUGH. WITH THIS ON THE PARIS AGREEMENT JOURNAL BOMBER AND SHE- THEY'RE DOING THINGS. THAT ARE MAKING MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND WE ARE BY A LONG SHOT I MEAN. A MILLION A YEAR WHICH WE HAVE TO GET TO SO THEY'RE NOT PERFECT BUT- DON'T DEMONISE CHINA AS THE ONLY EVIL IN THE WORLD WE GOT A LOT OF THE EVIL. RIGHT HERE. THEIR OWN SELVES SO WE GOT TO CORRECT. AND THE USE THE FUNDAMENTAL. IS CLAIM IS DESTROYING NORVING TELL. I'M HERE NOW I'VE NEVER SEEN THE NGUYEN. FOR QUARTER. IS ALMOST. DRY UP FIRST ON EVER IN THE LIVING MEMORIES OR HERE YOUR- IS GONNA SUCK. GREATLY BOB YOU TAKE THE SOME PARTS FROM CHINA WHICH IS OVER OF THE- MERICAN. TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHEAP LABOR MARKET BUT BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AMERICA HAS TO DO SOMETHING- EUROPE- IN CHINA BUT CHINA IS THE BIGGEST POLLUTER SO. WE GOT TO GET THEM ON BOARD THEY ARE ON BOARD AND WE CAN WORK IN JOINT RESEARCH PROJECTS AND MAKE IT BETTER YOUR IDEA THAT THERE ARE A 100% EVIL AT WE'RE ON A PRESENT GOOD. IS PLAYING OUT RIGHT FALLS AND DANGEROUS. IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN MORE SUFFERING IF PEOPLE LISTEN TO YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT IN. CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. BUT TO RESPOND. YEAH CENTER BOB FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR CALLING A I GOT I SAW I THE TO END OF A IN EDGE. IN LOOK I'M NOT SAYING THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE PERFECT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE POLICIES THAT PUSH AMERICAN COMPANIES OUT HERE HAPPENED IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND YOU WERE PART OF IT TWO TWO TERMS AS GOVERNOR SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO MAKE A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA I RUN ONE AND I'M TAKES OF THOSE ABOUT THE CLIMATE. MY FAMILY HOMESTEADED HERE. AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S DRY. AND A LOT OF THOSE POLICIES OF WHITES BURNING IS BECAUSE WE- DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE IN CALIFORNIA IN OUR FORCED. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD ECONOMY AND BUSINESSES LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IF WE CAN PRODUCE THOSE JOBS HERE. AND CREATE THOSE PRODUCTS WE NEED HERE THAT'S LESS THAN THEM DOING ITS DIRTY OVER THERE THAT'S MY POINT THEY'VE NEVER AGREED. OR NEVER THEY AGREE BUT THEY DON'T DO THAT'S THE POINT I'M I'M TRYING TO SAY AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MEXICO. AND IN CANADA LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL. WHERE DO YOU THINK ALL OF OUR AGRICULTURE IS GOING TO MEXICO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE REGULATIONS OF THE I'VE EVER THEIR SHIPPING THEIR FOOD IN HERE FOR US TO EAT WITH IT'S CONTAMINATED. SO IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WORLD ECONOMY WE HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL IN THE CONSIDERATION. AND WE WERE LEADING BUT WORK WERE DRIVING CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA AND AMERICANS SO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT WE DON'T HEAR. THAT HURT BUSINESSES TO MAKE THEM LEAVE IF WE CAN DRIVE THE COST OF. PRODUCING DOWN HERE WE CAN PRODUCE IT HERE. THANK YOU I WILL GO TO. OUR CHAIR EMERITUS. BACK TO THE INSTITUTE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE COULD BE TOWARD RESEARCH WHAT ARE YOU SEE STUDENTS AND CHINA UNIVERSITIES STUDENTS AND- THE LAW SCHOOLS COULD BE DOING SOME WORK I'M- IN. BERMAN SHE SHE N. BIDEN ARNOLD PALMER CAN HAVE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS AT THE WHITE WOULD- SPECIAL ENVOY CARRYING SPECIAL ENVOYS AND HAL I'M MORE FOCUSED ON THE SUB NATIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE RULE TO CALIFORNIA PLACE N. N. D. DEVELOPMENT OF THAT DIALOGUE IN ORDER TO FURTHER THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DIFFERENT STATES WITHIN CHINA THE DEFENSE CITIES THE REGIONS. THAT THEY HAVE WE SOMETIMES WE GET CAUGHT UP WITH THE BIG CHINA AND THE BIG UNITED STATES WHERE I THINK THAT THE ROLE THE ROLE FOR US AS A STEP NATIONAL IS NOT TO LEAD IN THESE DISCUSSIONS ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA. WE SPEAK OFTEN WE'RE WE'RE LEADING BUT TO BE SUPPORTIVE SO WHERE DO YOU SEE HOW DO YOU SEE THE INSTITUTE WORKING AS IN THE SUB NATIONAL ROLE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE DO CERTAIN THINGS WE TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS BUT HOW CAN WE ADVANCE THESE ALL THESE GOALS THAT WE SHARE AND HOW. MIGHT YOU THINK. ARE PARTNERS IN THE CITY'S AND THE STATES OF CHINA WE MAY INTERACT WITH THEM THROUGH THE INSTITUTE. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISTER TERRY IF I COULD DEFER THAT QUESTION TO THE GOVERNOR I THINK HE HAS A FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. FANTASTIC GOVERNOR BROWN. WE'LL GET WHAT THE US IS THE QUESTION HERE'S WHAT WE DOING WELL RESTATE THE QUESTION AGAIN BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HER THAT WELL I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT MIGHT WE DO WE FORMALIZE THE INSTITUTE WE HAVE WE THIRD THERE'S FUNDING ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP BUT THE- THE- UNIVERSITY THE WHAT WHAT'S THE LEGISLATURE THOSE OF US WHO CONSIDER. CONCERNED ABOUT CLIMATE. A YOU KNOW WILL BE GO TO SCOTT GOING TO DIFFERENT COME AT SYMPOSIUMS WITH OTHER SUB NATIONALS WORKING ON. RECYCLING OR BY SEA LEVEL RISE HOW MIGHT WE WORK THROUGH THE INSTITUTE OF WITH THE INSTITUTE WHAT DO YOU ENVISION US DOING WHAT THE INSTITUTE TO FURTHER THE DIALOGUE WITH THE SUB NATIONAL. ENTITIES WITHIN CHINA. VERY GOOD POINT BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT SUBNATIONAL WE HAD INITIAL GOVERNMENT THEY'RE DOING THEIR THING- WE'RE WORKING FOR EXAMPLE WE PUT OUT A VERY DETAILED REPORT. ON HOW- CALIFORNIA IN A DIFFERENT PROVINCES CAN GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY THERE A LOT OF STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN THEIR EXAMPLES IN CHINA- LIKE IN XINJIANG WHERE THEY HAVE ALMOST A 100% OF THE BUSES. ELECTRIC AND WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPENINGSBUT- CHINA'S GOING TO REDUCE THEIR CALL. WE'RE PRODUCING A STUDY NOW TO SHOW THEM WHAT STEPS WHAT OBSTACLES HAVE TO OVERCOME FOR THEM TO MOVE MUCH RAP BUT MUCH MORE QUICKLY BEGINNING WITH A COAL THE SAME THING WITH US WHO BRING UP EIGHTEEN BILLION. GALLONS OF OIL AND DIESEL EVERY YEAR WE GOT TO GET THAT DOWN HOW DO WE DO THAT- THAT'S COMPLICATED AND WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE STUDIES WE CAN DO IT IN A JOINT WAY WE'VE ALSO HAD TRAINING- ACTIVITIES. HEARD BY THE CLOVER BUT WE'LL GET THEM GOING AGAIN WE'RE CONDUCTING ACTUAL TRAINING SESSIONS WHAT WE LEARNED IN CALIFORNIA. YOUR RESOURCES BOARD WE CAN HELP PEOPLE IN GUANGDONG AND OTHER PROVINCES IN CHINA TO ADOPT SOME OF THE- SIMILAR REGULATORY APPROACHES SO- THERE ANY INTERCOURSE- IS THERE ARE ACTUAL- CHOI RESEARCHER. WERE THEY LOOK AT SO OUR PROBLEM WE LOOK AT OF THEIR BEST WE'RE DOING NOW WORK IN THE LATE. WHO ARE WELL I THINK- WE CAN HOLD A- IS THE WITH SEND A DELEGATION- THE COP SIX- ELEVEN WE CAN DO BUT THAT THE MAIN POINT IS THE PROBLEM IS SO OVERWHELMING. THAT EVEN WORKING AT A SMALL PART OF IT NAMELY THE SUBNATIONAL OR- BY CITIES- WE CAN. ADVANCE OF ALL WE CAN DO SOME GOOD WE HAD ON THE LINE OR JUST TWO WEEKS AGO MAYOR GARCETTI AND THE MAYOR OF SHANGHAI TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO THE THERE'S AN OPEN. DIALOGUE HERE AND I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING AS OUR TWO COUNTRIES THEY CLOSER TO WAR OVER TAIWAN IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT THE RESULT IN SOME WE KEEP OPEN SOME CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION VERY IMPORTANT TO EXCHANGE IDEAS ON THESE CLIMATE TOPICS. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO SOLVE. ALL THE PROBLEMS BUT IT IS A POSITIVE. SET OF STEPS THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO BE A PART OF- THE UC IT WAS THE CALIFORNIA- CAN ALSO BE A PART OF AND WHICH I'M LOOKING AT AND IF THESE ARE SMALL. BUT POSITIVE STEPS TO A SAFER- MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY COMPATIBLE. WORLD WHICH WE ALL WANT TO LIVE THERE. OKAY WHAT IT MEANT HER. THANK YOU- I WON'T BE TO SERVE THIS I DO OF THE NEW CAR. ABSOLUTELY CERTAINLY CLIMATE TO SOME ON WE WITNESSING IN MY DISTRICT THAT. I DON'TTHINK YOU CAN HAVE- COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLIANT PARTNERS. IN I DO NOT BELIEVE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN IN ANY WAY- IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE COMPLIANT AND FOLLOW THE RULES. AND WE CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OUR OWN INDUSTRIES THEY FOLLOW THE RULES MAYBE THEY DON'T LIKE THEM. AND THEN THEY FIND A WAY OUT THEY GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY IF THEY CAN GET CHEAPER LABOR BUT THEY WOULD STAY HERE. IF WE DON'T DID NOT HAVE THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE A TO PRODUCE THEIR PRODUCTS AND WE OUGHT TO BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT. THAT WOULD HELP OUR I THINK TREMENDOUSLY BUT FOR TODAY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE HONEST BROKERS ARE YOU. DO NOT GET A GOOD DEAL. THANK YOU. I'M HERE GOVERNOR AND HE SAID THERE ARE REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ARE BROUGHT UP THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF HONEST BROKERS A COUPLE TIMES IN AND- YOU KNOW NIGHT. I MEAN I YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE TOUCHED UPON THIS A BIT. HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW I'M NOT LIKE MY SO OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT WE CAN'T. WITH THE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE DISCOUNT OF THE ABSOLUTE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHINA AND THIS CONVERSATION IN THE NEED FOR CHINA. A FOR US TO WORK WITH CHINA IN ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE. B. TO BE GIVEN THE CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE B. WE CAN RELY ON THEM TO BE A OF A PARTNER- TO BE IT'S A TO MEET TO MEET THEIR INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS HOW HOW SHOULD THE COMMITTEE BE THINKING ABOUT. ABOUT THAT CHALLENGE ABOUT THIS AT THAT ASPECT OF THIS CHALLENGE. VERY BROAD QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO BE FOCUSING ON. U. S. RELATIONSHIP THAT'S HUGE AND THEY'RE QUITE FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON HAVE GOT IT RIGHT QUITE YET AND EVEN WHAT IS RIGHT IT TAKES A LOT OF INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING AND A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE THERE'S DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW TO HANDLE THE CHINESE BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING. IF YOU JUST- SAY DEMONISE THEM AND SAY THEY'RE THE INHERENTLY EVIL WE'RE NEVER GONNA TALK TO THEM- THAT'S NOT HELPFUL DIALOGUE IS NOT A REWARD- BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE SOMEBODY DIALOGUE IS A NECESSITY- PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP SINCE WE HAVE AND THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IS CHINA HAS SHOWN IN MANY WAYS MORE LEADERSHIP THE AMERICAN IT WAS TRUMP THE PULLED OUT OF- THE PARIS AGREEMENT. IS TRUMP THAT CANCELED- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WAS IN THE CHINESE NOW WE'RE GETTING BACK TO SOME OF THAT BUT WE HAVE MANY STAGE AND WE'RE MONEY LEGISLATORS BUT WANT TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO IT'S NOT JUST CHINA- ALL OF US ALL HUMAN BEINGS DRIVING A HARD TIME FINDING WAYS TO GET OFF FOSSIL FUEL TO GET TO A PROSPEROUS- ACADEMY. BASED ON RENEWABLE ENERGY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND THIS IS A MATTER NOT JUST FOR POLITICIANS BUT FOR INTELLECTUALS FOR ACADEMICS RESEARCHERS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ALSO A RESPONSIBILITY OF DIPLOMATS- TO TRY TO CREATE OPENINGS- WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE I THINK WHEN THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR NEWSOM DID SPEAK WITH THE GOVERNOR OF GUANGDONG THAT'S A POSITIVE WHEN THE MAYOR OF LA HE SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR OF SHANGHAI. THAT'S GOOD I MEAN LOOK THE WAR DRUMS ARE BEATING AND THAT CHINA MAY WELL TAKE BACK TAIWAN THEY THINK THAT THERE'S AND IF WE WANT TO DEFEND THEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE WORLD WAR THREE SO YOU DON'T WHAT YOU KNOW DON'T WORRY THERE'S PLENTY. A CONFLICT WITH CHINA I'M JUST SAYING LET'S FOR. THOSE OF MY PATHWAYS OR THE USUAL CLIMATE THAT THE SUB. LEVEL WE CAN. A LOT OF STRONG. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. DID YOU GO HOW HELPFUL. OKAY GOOD DISCUSSION THE DISCUSSION ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- THE ITEMS BEEN MOVED BY- SILVA CASKEY I'M IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THOUGHTS ON ABSOLUTELY I COULDN'T POSSIBLY REPEAT WHAT THE GOVERNOR SET UP I AGREE TOTALLY WITH WHAT HE SAID AND I THINK YOU KNOW. IF I COULD JUST PERHAPS SO GIVE A QUICK RESPONSE ON ON- THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE BY THE OTHER SENATOR. I THINK CHINA HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS OVER THE YEARS AND I THINK YOU KNOW A PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEN I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WEEK WEEK WE SHOULD EXPECT. HE ADDED I THINK THE LEVEL OF EXPECTATION AUTUMN OUGHT TO BE REASONABLE I THINK IF YOU COMPARE CHINA TODAY YES IT YOU KNOW COMPARED TO. TWENTY YEARS AGO TEN YEARS E. SO THEY HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT. SO I THINK IT IT TAKES MORE THAN A YOU KNOW A DAY OR A MONTH TO YOU KNOW MAKE. TREMENDOUS PROGRESS SO I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK- YOU MAY TAKE SOME TIME IN IN IN THIS IS A VERY SMALL STEP LIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID I THINK IS A VERY MODEST TO- YOU KNOW ATTEMPT TO. BUILD THAT KIND OF COLLABORATION SO WITHOUT I. ENJOYED IT THE DISCUSSION AND I A PARTICULAR GOVERNOR I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR YOUR WISDOM. AND TO THINK ALL THE SENATORS FOR THE DISCUSSION ALSO SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU. I COULD REGULATE JERRY. MUSINGS ON INTERNATIONAL. POLITICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ANYTIME- SO I DO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION GOVERNOR APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS ITEM FORWARD- I DO THINK THAT TO DIE I THINK THE DISCUSSION WAS HEALTHY TO BE HONEST- AND WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES RAISED WERE IT WERE VALID THOUGH I THINK THEY ULTIMATELY. DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE ABSOLUTE NEED AN IMPERATIVE FOR US TO PASS A MEASURE LIKE THIS THAT- THAT WILL THAT WILL. I PUT CALIFORNIA'S BEST FOOT FORWARD AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME. SOME SOLUTIONS TO THESE VERY THORNY. THORNY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AS TO HOW WE AS TO HOW WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO. I WITH THAT AT THE END OF THE MOVE BY SENATOR CASKEY. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ITEM NUMBER THREE AB THIRTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALLEN HI. HI BATES WELL BATES KNOWN DALLY. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ ICE SKINNER STERN STERN IOWA CASKEY BY STI. OKAY WE'RE GONNA PULL THAT OPEN FOR A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBERS OUT ON THE BED APPRECIATE. APPRECIATE YOU SUMMER CHAU BAKER IMAGE SEVEN. GREAT SO LET'S NOW GO TO THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA THIS IS ITEM H. H. ID NUMBER ONE H. A. R. TO. A SIMMER O'DONNELL UNFORTUNATELY I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE HERE IN PERSON I THINK HE'S STILL COMING UP FROM LOS ANGELES. SO CENTER STERN WILL BE PRESENTING CENTER STERN COURSES ARE CHAIR OF THE NATURISM WATER COMMITTEE. AND IT'S GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT AN ITEM THAT IS JUST SHOCKED THE PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES THE LOS ANGELES TIMES IS COME OUT WITH. A PRETTY. SHOCKING SERIES OF ARTICLES ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH- DDT WAS JUST WANTONLY DUMPED OFF OF OUR COASTLINE. IT'S ENORMOUSLY DIFFICULT ISSUE TO REMEDIATE- AND- IN IT IT'S KID IN POISON CONTINUES TO SEEP OUT- IN OUR IN OUR COASTAL WATERS AND SO I'M I'M- WE WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT- THIS MORNING TO. SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AS WE DISCUSS THIS. IMPORTANT RESOLUTION SO I WANT TO TURN TO YOU MY FRIEND COLLEAGUE CENTER STERN. TO START US OFF. IF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE'RE TALKING BOUT DICHLORO DIPHENYL TRICHLOROETHANE THIS IS A- PRODUCT THAT MANY OF US THOUGHT WAS BURIED IN HISTORY FRANKLY- MOTIVATED A LARGE SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT SPECIALLY IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE MONTROSE CORPORATION BASED IN TORRANCE CALIFORNIA WAS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF THIS. EMILY VERY USEFUL AND EFFECTIVE INSECTICIDE THAT- SINGLE HANDEDLY. WROUGHT INTO ENDANGERMENT- MUCH OF OUR COASTAL WILDLIFE AND EVEN WORSE YET- HUMAN BEINGS- THE EFFECTIVE D. D. T. IT'S A BIO ACCUMULATING CHEMICALS SO IT STORES UP IN FATTY TISSUE OF ANIMALS THAT THAT ALLOWS THOSE CONCENTRATIONS TO SIR TO INCREASE FARTHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN. CAUSED EGGSHELL THINNING AND HE THINK ABOUT WHY THE BALD EAGLE IS BEEN ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION- IT'S D. D. T. HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS- CARCINOGENIC CARCINOGENIC ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING BUT OTHER- STRANGE EFFECTS FROM THIS INSECTICIDE ON THINGS LIKE OBESITY AND EVEN- EARLY ON STRICT OF- REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH- SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND TONS DURING THE THIRTY FOR THIRTY TO THIRTY YEARS OF USE. WERE APPLIED DOMESTICALLY AND THE HALF LIFE IN THE QUALITY CAN VITAMINS IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS MEANING THAT IT WILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF YEARS TO FULLY BREAKDOWN DDT. BUT WE THOUGHT WE HAD DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WHEN MONTROSE SHUT DOWN PRODUCTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. I WAS BANNED FOR USE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN FACT PRODUCTION CONTINUED TO. TO BE ON A FEEDING THE EXPORT SIDE- BUT- THERE WAS A SENSE THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN DONE. HOWEVER STARTING IN THE TWENTY TENS IN. A DDT WAS PROJECTED TO BE DISCOVERED UCSB RESEARCHERS USING SUBMERSIBLES ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FEET DEEP ON THE OCEAN FLOOR BETWEEN CALIFORNIA COAST. AND CATALINA ISLAND STARTED DISCOVERING BARRELS THE FOUND ABOUT SIXTY BARRELS. OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND THEY CAN'T HUNTING. AND SIXTY IS BALLOONED TO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. IN A FIFTY SIX MILE SQUARE AREA. AND POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE HAVE YET TO BE DISCOVERED. OF ESSENTIALLY ACID WASTE. IN OUR AT SEA LIFE. WE'VE SEEN IN FACT EVIDENCE THAT MANY OF THESE BARRELS AREN'T JUST CONTAINED AND HOPEFULLY UNEXPOSED TO THE SEA BUT MANY WERE AXED- TO ALLOW FOR- THEM TO SINK- HANDED HANDS. HAND BASS AXING OF THESE GIRLS HAVE. BECAUSE EXPOSURE IN DISPOSING THAT- COULD BE FELT FOR GENERATIONS AND THIS RESOLUTION IS REALLY HERE NOT JUST TO SAY THAT THE COMPANY SETTLEMENT WHICH WAS I THINK A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- WAS NOT ENOUGH FRANKLY WAS SHORT SIGHTED IN LIGHT OF THE DISPOSABLE DISPOSAL WORK- BUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PARTNERS HERE TO STOP THE BLEEDING- THE L. A. TIMES BLEW THIS STORY WIDE OPEN. BUT NOW WE NEED CONGRESS AND THE EPA TO TAKE ALL MEASURES NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE DDT DUMPING SITE OFF THE COAST OF LA FROM CAUSING FURTHER HARM TO OUR PEOPLE OUR OCEANS AND OUR WILDLIFE. SO I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRINGING THIS FORWARD- THIS IS ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION RESOLUTION TO- SUPPORTED BY OUR L. A. COUNTY BARD OF SUPERVISORS IN. A NUMBER OF OTHERS BUT THIS IS GOING TO TAKE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL COOPERATION TO GET THIS- TO GET THIS BLEEDING STOP THIS THIS IS A- DECADES IN THE MAKING BUT- AN UGLY TRUTH HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN CHILE LOOSE WITH THE HEAL THE BAY AND MICHAEL PARMER WITH CITY OF HAVE A LOT OF REALLY BEEN TIP OF THE SPEAR HERE SO I THINK THEY'RE ON THE- PHONE TO TESTIFY TODAY. WAS RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER STERN I MEAN IT THIS IS AN ISSUE- YOU KNOW I'VE I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT. BOTH THE PALACE VERDES PENINSULA ALSO SANTA CATALINA ISLAND- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART- YOU KNOW YOU AND I. GREW UP SWIMMING IN THE SANTA MONICA BAY. HI SENATOR AND- IT IS JUST DESPICABLE WHEN YOU GO AND LOOK AT THE AT THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE PEOPLE JUST. I'M JUST DUMPING POISON DIRECTLY INTO THE OCEAN AND I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW EVERYTHING THEY KNOW. NOW ABOUT DDT BUT THEY KNEW ENOUGH TO KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS THE WRONG THING TO DO. AND THIS COMPANY AT. FIRST THE ENTIRE REGION HI I'M IN A WAYTHAT WE WILL WE WE'RE GONNA QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE- IT'S COULD BE SO DIFFICULT FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO MITIGATE AND REMEDIATE- BECAUSE OF THE LOGISTICS. ASSOCIATED WITH AND WITH WITH FINDING THESE BARRELS- GET MEN AND THEN FIGURE OUT SOME SORT OF. COST EFFECTIVE MANNER- ATTITUDE TO REMEDIATE SO ON HOW MANY MORE BARRELS ARE OUT HERE WHERE EXACTLY DID THEY COME FROM WE KNOW MOST OF THAT WE LEAST NOW I KNOW WE KNOW BUT I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE'S MORE INFORMATION. YOU KNOW WHERE IT WHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE BARRELS- WHAT TO THE CLEANUP AND RECOVERY EFFORTS LOOK LIKE A LOOK AT THE STATE TODAY THESE EFFORTS SO WE'RE NOT KILL THE A TEENS ARE ALL THESE QUESTIONS TODAY BUT HOPEFULLY EARLY WITNESSES WILL HELP US BRING. A TOGETHER A ROBUST DISCUSSION. ON AND WE LIKE TO HAVE AN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING- ON THIS TOPIC IN THE FALL WE DO HOWEVER KNOW THAT THAT AT LEAST. SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BARRELS FILLED WITH DDT ARE SITTING THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG- IN FEDERAL WATERS MOST OF THEM- SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PULL IN OUR PARTNERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THIS RESOLUTION WILL. HELP US TO DO THAT TOO SO. HOW THE HOUSE LET'S GO TO YEARLY WITNESSES SENATOR I LET'S GO TO SHELLEE LOOSE FROM HEAL THE BAY COURSES. AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE EFFORT TO. THAT'S IT TO CLEAN UP OUR BAY HI DON SEMOGA BANK LET'S GO TO YOU HI DR LOOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. THEY SUPPORTS AJ ARE TO THE IMPORTANT STEP IN SOLVING THIS BT KEY PROBLEM IN OUR LOCAL WATERS. WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WE READ THE ANGER OUT REACH PROGRAM TO PROTECT SUBSISTENCE FISHERS WHO ARE SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. BY PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT DDT CONTAMINATION IN THE FISH THAT THEY'RE FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES SUCH AS ONE OF THE IMPACT OF THIS TOXIC DUMPING. THE LATEST DISCLOSURES OF THE DEEPWATER DUMPSITE ARE DEVASTATING AS YOU DESCRIBED AND THEY HIGHLIGHT BASE OF PROBLEM THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY AND CONTINUES TO HARM PEOPLE AND OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERY DAY. IT IS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. OR THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. BUT THERE ARE SOME STEPS. THAT WE MUST TAKE NOW AND THIS RESOLUTION IS PART OF THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST FUND THE SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENTS TO FIND THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AS WELL AS STUDIES OF THE TRANSPORT AND FATE OF THE DDT AND OTHER CHEMICALS. BECAUSE THE DUE PROCESS FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY DO MOVE THROUGH FOOD CHAIN. WE MUST INCREASE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO REACH MORE OF THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO ARE AT RISK FROM EATING AND FEEDING TO THEIR FAMILIES INCLUDING PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. BUILD DEVELOPING IN THEIR- METALLURGICAL SYSTEM THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FISH WERE CONTAMINATED AND WHAT THE RISKS ARE EATING THE FISH. WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE DUMPING PERMIT IN RECORDS TO DETERMINE WHO ELSE WAS RESPONSIBLE WHO PRODUCED THIS WAY AND PROFITED FROM THE THING WE CAN SEEK FINANCIAL COMPENSATION TO HELP PAY FROM THE- RELIGIOUS SAID IT'S. GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE. I FINALLY. WE MUST ACT UP TO DUMP SITE WHERE POSSIBLE. THE TV SULFATE WHICH IS CLOSE THE PROSPERITY HAS A DEDICATED SETTLEMENT FUNDS BUT VERY LITTLE HAS BEEN DONE TO ACTUALLY CLEAN UP THAT NIGHT. RIGHT NOW HE PAGE RELYING ON NATURAL REMEDIATION OR NATURAL BREAKDOWN IN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUATE MONITORING. WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO BEGIN TO KNOW IF THIS IS WORKING. OR WHERE THAT DD IS GOING AS IT BREAKS DOWN INTO ITS- BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS WHICH STILL HAVE TOXICITY THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S WHY FUNDING OF SCIENCE DETERMINES THAT THERE AND WHERE IT STANDING UP IS SO CRITICAL AND AJ ARE TOO IS AN IMPORTANT. STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIRTY DOCTORS. LET'S NOW GO TO MY- MY FRIEND- AND- MICHAEL PALMER'S ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER AT THE CITY OF AVALON. ON CATALINA ISLAND. ALLEN CENTER CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY- REGARDING THE PREVIOUS DDT DUMPING AT DISPOSAL SITES OFF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST AS BRIEFLY MENTIONED MY NAME IS MICHAEL PARMER AND ON THE ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF AVALON ON BEHALF OF THE CITY I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORTER FIRST ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TO. AVALON IS AN ISLAND COASTAL COMMUNITY LOCATED ON SANTA CATALINA ISLAND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO MILES OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE A LITTLE OVER TWO POINT EIGHT SQUARE MILES IN SIZE AND HOME TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE YEAR ROUND WITH OVER ONE MILLION VISITORS PER YEAR THE CITY IS THE ONLY INCORPORATED MUNICIPALITY ON THE ISLAND OF WHICH SEVENTY SIX MILES OF PROTECTED NATURAL CONSERVATION LAND WE HAVE OVER SIXTY TWO MILES A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE UNDEVELOPED COASTLINE NINE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. AND FOR AREAS A SPECIAL BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE WERE HOME TO MORE THAN SIXTY ENDEMIC PLANT ANIMAL AND INSECT SPECIES FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AND MANY PROTECTED SPECIES MARINE LIFE THE CITY ON THE ISLAND HAVE A VIBRANT TOURIST AND RECREATION BASED ECONOMY THAT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN SOLVING CALIFORNIA'S HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR OCEAN TOURIST ECONOMY OUR CITY POPULATION CAN INCREASE BETWEEN SEASON AND OUR ECONOMY AND THE WELFARE OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM. AND ROBUST POLICIES OF BAKER BERMAN STEWARDSHIP A PROTECTED NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS AB ONE ON THE ISLAND HAVE A STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PLUS BE AN INHERENT MISSION OF PROTECTING COASTAL RESOURCES AND UNIQUE STATE AND FEDERAL SAFEGUARDS THAT HELP PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT FROM POLLUTION AND PRESERVE WATER QUALITY. AS AN ISLAND PHYSICALLY ISOLATED OFF THE CALIFORNIA MAINLAND BY THE PACIFIC OCEAN WATER QUALITY IN OCEAN CONSERVATION IS CRITICAL TO THE PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF OUR ECONOMY HOWEVER THE REDISCOVERY OF DDT AND OTHER TOXIC CHEMICAL WASTE DUMPING AT THE DISPOSAL SITES OFF CALIFORNIA COAST IN THE ST PETER BASS AND POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO OUR MARINE LIFE. OUR RESIDENTS AND DESERVES HELP AND OUR FUTURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY. WELL THE POLITICAL LOGICAL ON HEALTH. FROM D. AND OTHER. WAYS DUMPING OR STILL BEING A- DECADES LAW. CHRIS FEDERAL AND STATE IS TO CLEAN UP THE OUTSIDE. THE SIGNIFICAN. OF THE AMOUNT OF DD DUMPED IN THE BASIN CANNOT BE OVERSTATED WELL NOT AS VISIBLE AS A SEVENTEEN MILE SUPERFUND SITE WAS DESIGNATED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AT ADDRESS DDT AND PCBS REALIZE RELEASED. FROM WHERE SEWAGE AND- TOXIC SEWAGE EMPTIED DIRECTLY INTO THE OCEAN THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF DDT AND OTHER TOXIC CHEMICAL WASTE DUMPING. OUT INTO THE SAN PEDRO BAY ST AMOUNTS TO GROSS CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE AT BEST A POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE MOST A BORING BAR MIDDLE STRATEGIES OF COURSE. THE CITY OF BABYLON VALUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND APPLAUDS COMMITTEE FOR TAKING ACTION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK TO SUPPORT ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE PROTECT PRESERVE OUR BUT- FORMER NATURAL RESOURCES AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT ARMS GO TO I DON'T SEE ONE IN PERSON EITHER HERE TWENTY FORTY TWO ONE A TESTIFIED SUPPORT- ON THE PHONE OF THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR'S ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES LIKE EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THIS H. A. R. THANK YOU. TO STATE SUPPORT FOR A DAY OR TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO. THERE ARE NO LINES INTO AT THIS TIME OKAY I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION HERE IN PERSON MODERATORS ANYONE NOW AND- ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESOLUTION- OPPOSITION. I KNOW IT ON THE RESERVATION THANK YOU. IF YOU LIKE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION OVER THE PHONES TO AJ ARE TO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEM ZERO. YEAH MY COMMANDERS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO USING YOUR TELEPHONE. THERE ARE NO LINES IN Q. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HI. YOU KNOW. I AM I WOULD LIKE TO I KNOW OUR OUR OUR WITNESSES ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER SOME SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT- ABOUT THE VARIOUS ISSUES AT PLAY AND I KNOW THE SENATORS WELL AND HAS BEEN HAS BEEN BONING UP ON THIS STUFF- LET ME LET ME LET ME JUST TO ASK OUR WITNESSES CAN YOU GIVE US A- SENSE OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS THESE CHEMICALS AND HOW LONG THEY LAST IN THE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. MAYBE ALL ONE THIRTY SIR WE'RE SAYING IT'S A HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR HALF LIFE FOR HANNITY YOUR HOUSEPLANTS COULD BE MULTIPLE HUNDREDS OF YEARS DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF THE DUMPING BUT DOCTOR LOOSENESS MORE. YEAH COULD COULD YOU RIGHT SO IT'S A DOCTOR WAS IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT IT JUST A BIT MORE UNITY SPOKE TO ABOUT THIS BUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE- JUST AT THE TOP LINES OF THE FACTS WE SHOULD BE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AND- IN A AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS. WHAT WHAT DO WE NOT KNOW I MEAN WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT WORRIES YOU. AS TO AS TO AS TO AS TO QUESTIONS THAT STILL NEED TO BE ANSWERED. WITH REGARDS TO THE G. YES. THANK YOU- WELL THE TOP LINE AFFECTS OUR BED SENATORS YOU'RE MENTIONED CANCER AND ENDOCRINE OR REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS AND WE KNOW THAT THE CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS NOT ONLY IN THE LAB WORK THROUGH DIRECT EXPOSURE BUT THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE EPIDEMIC OF CANCER THAT WE'RE SEEING IN FELINES WHICH HAS BEEN LINKED CONCLUSIVELY TO THE DDT CYLINDER MAMMALS JUST LIKE US THEY'RE EATING FISH AND IT'S CONCENTRATING THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN. AND INTO THEIR TISSUES AND CAUSING CANCER WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE ALSO EATING FISH WERE SOME OF THE TOP PREDATORS IN THE OCEAN AND WE KNOW THAT FISH THAT PEOPLE CONSUME LOCALLY HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DDT SO THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN IF WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT OR CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL DEVELOPING BRAINS AND NERVOUS SYSTEM- CONCEALMENT FISH IT CAN HAVE A VERY VERY AREA- HARM TO THEM CAN CAUSE VERY SERIOUS HARM TO THEM. ANOTHER AFFECT THAT IS ONLY BECOMING CLEAR OVER TIME IS THE LONG TERM GENERATIONAL IMPACT AND THAT'S REALLY SCARY TO ME AND I THINK TO EVERYONE BECAUSE WE NOW KNOW THAT CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN OF WOMEN WHO WERE DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO DDT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CHAU REPRODUCTIVE IMPACTS TODAY THAT THE EARLY ONSET OF MENSTRUATION THE CHANGES IN MENSTRUAL PERIODS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE. AND ALSO THE BAY CITY AND OTHER HORMONE RELATED ILLNESSES ARE PRESENT IN A GRAND CHILDREN OF WOMEN WHO ARE EXPOSED EACH IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES SO WE ARE WE JUST FIND OUT OVER TIME JUST HOW BAD HOW PERVASIVE. NEED CHEMICAL ARE AND THOSE THAT IT EVEN HARDER TO DO IN WILDLIFE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DOLPHINS AND WHALES WE DON'T KNOW THEY MARRIED. BE SHOWING THE SAME. IMPACT SO FIRST PART OF YOUR YEAH I. THE NEXT PART. WELL THE QUESTION BILL WANNA GO ON TO ON LITTLE SUMMARY MEDIATION- AND SO I KNOW THIS ISN'T A NEW PROBLEM I MEAN THE SO THE PALACE VERDES COASTAL SHELF. I HAD D. V. T. WASTE. WITH THE DISCHARGE OFFSHORE- THAT'S BEEN A SUPERFUND SITE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE I BELIEVE. I'M SO. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THERE AND HOW HOW THE EFFORTS THERE MIGHT INFORM A RESPONSE OF THE DUMPSITES WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT. THE EFFORTS THERE IT MORE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE KEEP HEARING IS THAT THIS IS JUST AN IMMENSELY DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE- WHAT WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE EXISTING SUPER FIND ACTIVITIES HAPPENING OFF THE COAST. WELL I THINK THAT'S A GREAT APPROACH SENATOR BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A DIFFICULT PROBLEM AND WE FEEL LIKE TRYING THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT'S NOT A NEW PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS OFF THE PULSE RATIO BUT WE DO HAVE- ASSIGNED THE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION SOME OF IT THANKS THANKS IT'S ONLY BEEN SPENT ON THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS AS FAR AS I KNOW WHICH IS- PREVENTING THE SALE OF LOCAL FISHING FISH MARKET. AND REACHING OUT TO LIKE WE HAVE PEOPLE WALKING ON PEERS TALKING TO. ANGLERS ABOUT THE DANGER OF BEING THIS ISSUE THEIR FAMILIES WHAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER IS ACTUALLY MONITOR WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THIS CHEMICAL IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IN THE SENTIMENT IN THE WATER. IN THE ANIMALS IN THE OCEAN FORGET PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE CAN LEARN FROM- THE LACK BEEN. LESS SUCCESSFUL WORK ON THE TV SHOW SO FAR- ALSO ON THE TV SHOW WE HAVE HAD A PILOT PROJECT. WHEN WE TRIED TO DO CAPPING WHICH MEANS YOU PUT AN INNER CAP THAT SENTIMENT ON TOP OF THE CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT TO PREVENT THE CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT FROM ESCAPING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT WAS SUSPENDED THAT CAPPING PROJECT- IN PART BECAUSE- THE EPA. MONITORING WITH MACHINES JUST IT BREAK DOWN IN THE IN BY. I'M BORED. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN. UP ANOTHER. COLOR TO KNOW. IF THAT'S WORKING AND WHERE THAT DDT IS GOING BECAUSE WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN IT DOESN'T JUST GO RIGHT FROM DDT. TO HARMLESS CHEMICALS LIKE CARBON AND NITROGEN THAT ACTUALLY GO THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES OF. OTHER TOXIC BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS OF THE DTE LIKE BEEF FOR EXAMPLE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER WHERE IT'S GOING IT'S NO LONGER IN THE SENTIMENT IN THE SAME LOCATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. AND THAT. SCIENTISTS AT. THE UC SANTA BARBARA AND SCRIPT. AND NOW I HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DO AND THAT'S WHY THE FEDERAL FUNDING WILL BE SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN SEE. WHAT IS OUT THERE HOW MUCH WHERE IT IS THAT HE SAID WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE. FULL EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM- AND WHERE IT'S GOING THE FOR CHAIN. I'M DOCTOR WAS EITHER BEING SHORT OF PRESSURING THE FADS WHICH OF COURSE IS SEEMS TO BE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO ON THIS TOPIC. I'M WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE STATE'S ROLE IN ALL THIS LIKE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO THOSE OF US. IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHO WERE. REALLY DISTRESSED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THIS THIS CHALLENGE. WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE FOR ASSISTANCE AS A STEP TO ANNOTATE. I THINK WE SHOULD COMMIT SOME SMALLER AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING TO HELP MAKE SURE THIS GETS STARTED. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THE STATE- CAN LOOK INTO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS FURTHER ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CAN BE- SURFACE SO THAT WE CAN. GET THE PROPER AMOUNT OF FUNDING AS YOU SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH THE FIRST TIME AROUND THE MAYBE DIFFERENT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE DUMPING THIS TIME. WE HAVE RECORDS AND THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE I THINK THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. COULD REALLY PURSUE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE DUMPING ITSELF. I ALSO HOPE THAT THE STATE WILL PUT IN PLACE ALONG WITH THE FEDS. SOME SORT OF OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE A DUMP SITE LIKE THIS THAT. ENGINE SO MANY STATE AGENCIES SO MANY DIFFERENT SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AND AFFECTS SO MANY DIFFERENT. PEOPLE FROM THE SUBSISTENCE FISHERS TO THE PEOPLE ON CATALINA ISLAND. TWO OTHER TOURISM AND RECREATION AND DIVE TYPE OPERATIONS THE VERY HARD TO KEEP EVERYONE INFORMED AND IT'S VERY HARD. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND SCIENTISTS INVOLVED ARE. YOU SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER AND GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. THAT INCLUDED FINANCES AS WELL AS ADVOCATE THAT YOU FEEL THE BANK I THINK COULD HEP. KEEP THIS EFFORT MOVING FORWARD AND MAINTAIN THE TRANSPARENCY THAT WE ALL NEED IN ORDER TO PROTECT PEOPLE.
