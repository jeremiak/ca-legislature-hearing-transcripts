RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU I

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.241
THINK THEY'RE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY

00:29:03.308 --> 00:29:04.409
THE COMMITTEE IN THE LANGUAGE OF

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:05.844
THE BILL BUT I DON'T SEE

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.845
ANYWHERE IN THIS BILL THAT WE'RE

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:07.846
REQUIRED TO APPROVE IT.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.548
AND THAT'S BY A BIG PROBLEM THAT

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:12.584
I HAVE WITH THIS AMENDMENT --

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:13.818
IT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.320
PERFORMS A VITAL FUNCTION IN

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.621
SAFEGUARDING THAT MONEY AND

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.123
PROVIDING A LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.524
OVER THAT MONEY.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.860
AND ESPECIALLYIN LIGHT OF THE

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:22.994
HEARINGS THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.329

00:29:24.395 --> 00:29:25.964

LAST WEEK AND THEN A JOINT

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.167
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.069
HEARING IN WHICH THE DMV

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:32.504
TESTIFIED THAT.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.005
OTHER REALLY COULDN'T TELL US

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.573
WHY WE PAID SEVENTY MILLION

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.775
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.711
APPROPRIATION OF THEM TO REDUCE --

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:41.312
THE WAIT TIMES ARE FIELD OFFICES

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.781
IN OPEN SIXTY FIELD OFFICES ON

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:44.415

ARE THEY OPEN SOME FIELD OFFICES

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.852
ON SATURDAYS LAST YEAR IN JAIL

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.420
THIS YEAR IN JANUARY AND THEN

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:51.189
CURTAIL THEM --

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:52.323
AND WHEN I ASK HOW MUCH MONEY

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.458
WAS LEFT THEY SAID NONE IT ALL

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.559
BEEN SPENT IN THE IF THEY

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:56.261
COULDN'T JUSTIFY YOU KNOW WHERE

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.028
THAT MONEY HAD GONE AND SO I

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.163
HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH.

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.664
GIVING THEM ESSENTIALLY A BLANK

00:29:59.731 --> 00:30:01.466

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:02.967

THOSE DO IT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:12.310
ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IS

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:17.015
MISGUIDED.

THERE'S A DATE AND THERE'S

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.303
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A CERTAIN

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:39.604
NUMBER OF DAYS THERE.

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.806

THE APPROACH BE ADDITIONAL

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.214
FUNDING WOULD NOT BE

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.048
APPROPRIATED AND SO THAT'S BEEN

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:51.716
THE CONVENTION WE FOLLOWED AND

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:52.850
THAT'S HOW WE'RE ABLE.

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:55.820
TO ALLOW FOR FUNDING TO BE ADDED

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:56.955
WHILE THE LEGISLATURE'S NON

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.156
SESSIONS TO THEIR CONTINUED BE

00:30:58.223 --> 00:30:58.957
DISCUSSIONS OF THE INTENT OF

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.826
THIS LANGUAGE HERE.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:02.894
IS TO NOT.

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:05.463
FRAME THE DMZ AUGMENTATION

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.331
AROUND A TWENTY SIX MILLION

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.333
DOLLAR FUNDING LEVEL IS TO FRAME

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.134
AROUND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.836
REDUCE WAIT TIME SO THAT WE

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:13.972
ACTUALLY GET OUTCOME DIFFERENCE.

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:15.106
CHANGE THE OUTCOME FROM IN A

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.174
DIFFERENT DAY ADDITIONAL

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.041
APPROPRIATION AND THE

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.276
CONVERSATION TO BE THAT WAY

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.744
TIMES AS OPPOSED TO FRAMING.

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.746
THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION AROUND

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:23.481
AND NUMBER WHICH WITH THAT.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.316
KIND OF LEAD TO THAT OUTCOME DID

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.951
HERE THAT YOU REFERENCED EARLIER

00:31:27.018 --> 00:31:28.453
IN THE HEARING WHERE WE ADDED

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:29.387
MONEY WERE REALLY ABLE TO

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:31.289
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD CHANGE

00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:32.824
THE OUTCOME WHICH IS WHAT WHERE

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.024
REAL.

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:35.159
CONCERNS.

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.694
SO DO JUST GOOD JUST AND OTHER

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.896
DISTRICT REPLICATION DOWN.

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.164
WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:41.399
TWENTY SIX MILLION WITH THE

00:31:41.466 --> 00:31:43.067
TWENTY SIX MONEY WAS THE CORRECT

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.003
NUMBER MAYBE WAVES HIGH MAYBE

00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:45.436
WAS LOW.

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:45.670
BED --

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:46.471
EITHER WAY BASED ON THAT

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:50.041
PREVIOUS HEARING IT WAS CLEAR

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.342
THAT THEY HAD NOT BROUGHT FORTH

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.545
ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO JUSTIFY A

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:55.713
SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS SO

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.382
THAT'S WHY.

00:31:57.448 --> 00:31:59.817
THE WE HAD ASKED THAT THEY COME

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.519
BACK AND BASICALLY COME BACK TO

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.254
US DURING RECESS AND THEN JAIL

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.790
PC COMMITTEE WAS THE ONLY WAY TO

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:06.624
DO THAT WHILE WE WERE.

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.426
WHILE WE WERE OUT.

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.627
OKAY I UNDERSTAND I I WOULD FEEL

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:11.462
A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF --

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.131
AN EXPLICIT APPROVAL FROM THE

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.666
LEGISLATURE WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:16.067
WHAT YOU'VE SAID IS THAT IT'S

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.101
CONVENTION THAT ONCE THEY GIVE

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:18.803
US A NOTICE IF WE DISAGREE WITH

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.371
THAT WE CAN HOLD A HEARING.

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.406
BUT THAT'S NOT THEM IN THE

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.974
LEGISLATION DOES NOT SAY THAT WE

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:24.108
HAVE THE BILL NOW IF IF WE DON'T

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:25.643
CONCURRENT THAT IT WOULD THE

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.746
APPROPRIATIONS NOT OCCUR.

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:29.847
THAT'S THE CADETS A CONVENTION

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:32.617
FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET.

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:36.421
SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE ALLOWED TO

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:37.021
DO THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T WE

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:37.689
DIDN'T WANNA.

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.190
NAM NOT ALLOW THEM SOME

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:40.925
FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN NOW AND

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:44.362
JANUARY WHEN WE HE WANTED --

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.697
TO GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO COME

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:48.099
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WE

00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:50.668
OKAY OUR I REALLY WISH THAT WE

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:53.037
HAD APPROVED ON AUDIT OF HOW

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.672
THAT MONEY WAS SPENT THE LAST

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.341
TIME WE NEED AN ALLOCATION.

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:57.709
LIKE THIS THAT WOULD GIVE ME A

00:32:57.775 --> 00:32:59.744
LOT MORE COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:00.611
COULD WRITE THEM ESSENTIALLY A

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.080
BLANK CHECK AND EXPECT THE

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:03.748
PROBLEM TO GET SOLVED IT ON A

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:04.949
PORCH I DON'T HAVE THAT COMFORT.

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:06.017
WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE I THINK

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:06.884
WE'RE ALL INCENTIVIZE TO TRY AND

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.486
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.054
LAW AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THIS

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.423

INTENDED TO REPORT ON EXACTLY

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:54.492
HOW THAT WAS DONE SO --

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:55.726

WITH THOSE [inaudible]

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:12.443
OKAY BECAUSE I JUST --

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.679
IN GOING THROUGH.

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:16.314
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT DMV OFFICES

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:16.948
AND SAYING THERE.

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:19.283
REALLY I CAN'T FIND ANY THAT

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.685
DON'T HAVE KIND ENOUGH OF A LONG

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:24.622
WAIT SO I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:25.957
THERE MAY BE SOME OFFICES IN

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.892
THIS STATE THAT WON'T GET THOSE

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:28.726
EXTRA HOURS THAT REALLY NEED

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.561
THEM JUST AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.295
SOME OF THE OTHER COUNTY SAN

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.296
TURN FORGET.

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:32.864
HOW WE MAKE THAT FAIR AND

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.433
EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE IF

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.502
IT'S GOING TO BE --

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:40.004
SOMEWHAT ARBITRARILY DECIDED BY

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:43.140
THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF --

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:43.808
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND I DON'T

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:45.710
KNOW I MEAN I I'M NOT TRYING TO

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:47.278
THIS ISN'T A GOTCHA THIS IS

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.713
GENUINE CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:49.313
HAVE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.214
THAT WILL BE.

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.082
YOU KNOW STILL WAITING IN A VERY

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:52.517
LONG LINES ARE HOW DO WE MAKE

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.951
SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:55.319
WE'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE.

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:56.854
ESSENTIALLY --

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.090
UNLIMITED FUNDS TO THE EXTENT

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:00.925
THAT IT IS ASKED FOREIGN

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.393
JUSTIFIED FOR THAT PART I THINK

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.961
IT'S ARE COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:05.196
AND DOWN

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.598
IN A VERY VERY GOOD QUESTION AND

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:08.900
FACT THE QUESTION I ASKED --

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.601
W. DIRECTOR WHEN I MET WITH.

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.802
HIM ON MONDAY WOULD BE HAVING

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.204
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WOULD

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:15.273
WELCOME ANY MEMBER ON THE BUDGET

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.475
COMMITTEE OR ANY MEMBER OF THE

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:19.577
ASSEMBLY IF THEY WANT TO JOIN IN

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.012
ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPY.

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:24.382
TO ON THE DE DEPUTY COULD NOT

00:36:24.448 --> 00:36:27.184
SPECIFY EXACTLY THE METHODOLOGY

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.453
THAT I ASKED EXACT IN QUESTION.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.455
HOW DID YOU CHOOSE WHERE YOU

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:33.324
ALLOCATE RESOURCES?

00:36:33.391 --> 00:36:35.059
WHAT ARE THEY DOING ON THE HEAT

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.327
HE DID SHOW ME?

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:37.628
THAT BASED ON THEIR BEST

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:38.696
CALCULATION OF WAIT TIMES WHERE

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.197
THERE WERE WITH THE WORST WAIT

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:41.999
TIMES WHICH WERE NOT WHICH OF

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.334
THE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENCOURAGE

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:46.137
HIM TO SHARE WITH.

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.271
SO THEY CAN GET A KIND OF OF A

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:49.807
GAS OF WHERE WHERE THINGS ARE --

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:51.175
HAVING THE MOST PRESSURE BUT

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:53.477
HAVING SAID THAT I THINK IT'S ON

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.745
ACTUALLY PROPER THAT WE CONTINUE

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:57.281
TO FOLLOW UP AND UNDERSTAND HOW

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:58.749
THESE RESOURCES ARE DEPLOYED.

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.751
SO THAT AGAIN THESE WAIT TIMES

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:03.387
WHICH AGAIN ARE STATEWIDE ISSUE

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:04.722
CAN BE ADDRESSED ACROSS THE

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:06.290
BOARD SUB POP UPS LOW AND AGAIN

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:08.426
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED HAPPY --

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:09.794
TO INCLUDE ANYONE AND FURTHER A

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.194
PROPER [inaudible]

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.862
PART [inaudible]

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.965
MR MATHIS.

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:16.467
SO MY MY QUESTION GOES ALONG

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:17.735
SOME THE SAME LINES.

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.236
I ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:20.871

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:30.548
THESE PROBLEMS?

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:31.782
ON PART OF THE CONVERSATION

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:34.185

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:37.388
OCCASIONS WITH KIOSK IN THERE'S

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.156
HIGH PROPENSITY AREAS THAT DON'T

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:41.392
HAVE KIOSK --

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:42.727
IN IN I THINK THE THE CHAIR

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.362

EXTENDING HOURS A IN IN THESE

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.208
THINGS BLADE CURRENT FROM THE

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:58.676
ANSWERS WERE GETTING --

00:37:58.743 --> 00:37:59.810
APPEAR ALREADY TODAY YOU GUYS

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:01.012
SEEM TO NOT KNOW THOSE.

00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:02.613
I MEAN CAN YOU.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.015
SEAN SOME LIGHT ON THAT A LITTLE

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.449
BIT MORE.

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:06.917
YES I THINK SO IN TERMS OF THE

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.786
KIOSKS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:11.489

AND SO THE OTHER NUMBER OF THEM

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.161
IN DMV OFFICES AND THEN A FEW

ESTABLISHMENTS.

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.900

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.403
THAT.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.937

KIOSKS --

00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.575

WHERE THAT'S GOING TO WORK BEST

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.984
SOCIALS PART OF THE THE PROCESS

KIOSK IN RETAIL OUTLETS IN IN

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:50.294
THOSE THINGS AS WELL.

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:51.796
AS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:57.168
I BELIEVE SO YES.

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:58.402
THE DEBATE IN THAT MEETING THAT

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:58.969
I HAD ON MONDAY THE DEPUTY

00:38:59.036 --> 00:38:59.970
DIRECTOR DID --

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.505
THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN ON ALL OF

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.708
US WERE IN THEM MEANING IN THIS

00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:05.710
I'M TWENTY AND YOU'RE ABOUT

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:06.343
CRIED DOMINATE YOUR QUESTION ON

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.344
THIS RIGHT.

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:09.346
GO FOR MY QUESTIONS FOR THEM

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:09.980
SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT'S FUN

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:14.085
THINKING THAT.

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.020
THAT THEY DO HAVE A SPECIFIC

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:18.689
PLAN FOR KIOSKS ON MY

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:20.224
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT --

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.326
THEY LOOK AT A CONTRACT AND ARE

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:24.729
EXPANDING THOSE OPTIONS ARE

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.796
AROUND THE STATE AND THEY HAVE

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.631
NOT THEY DID NOT TELL ME EXACTLY

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:28.165
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.433
DEPLOYED.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.067
BUT THEY HAVE MORE THAT WILL BE

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.203
DEPLOYED.

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:32.837
AND THEN YOU AT I JUST THINK

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:36.474
IT'S IMPORTANT THE PUBLIC KNOWS.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.274
WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN THEY'RE

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:37.975
MEETING WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN IT

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:38.776
IT DOESN'T GET OUT TO THE PUBLIC

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:39.710
ON WHAT THESE PLANTS ARE?

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:41.879
IN A ANY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:44.014
PUBLIC ESPECIALLY WITH WITHOUT

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.082
HAVING AN AUDIT.

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:46.650
AND IN HAVING THESE THINGS IN IN

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:48.419
TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS LATER

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:49.987
ONE OR NOT IN SESSION AND I

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.188
THINK FOR A LOT OF OUR PUBLIC

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.557
SOURCE OF MY CONSTITUENTS.

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.525
THE SHEET IS IT BEING DONE --

00:39:54.592 --> 00:39:56.627
AND IN THE DARK OF NIGHT AND NOT

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.696
BEING A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY AND

00:39:58.763 --> 00:39:59.964
SO I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.031
ARE UPSET.

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.801
BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING THAT WAY

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:04.869
THE INFORMATION IS NOT GETTING

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.904
OUT AND THEN WITH THE AUDIT NOT

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.339
HAPPENING THERE'S EVEN MORE

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.640
QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ASKED.

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:11.509
SO IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.043
SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.912
WITH OUR DMV IN WITH.

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.714
OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS GOOD GOOD

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.182
WITH MORE WHICH IS WHY CHAIR

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.750
THAT HEARING ALL LAST WEEK --

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.485
WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.687
UP HEARINGS AND I BELIEVE THAT --

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:25.990
BASED ON THIS IT'S TO COME IN ON

00:40:26.056 --> 00:40:27.892
US AS AS MESSENGERS TO OUR

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:28.993
CONSTITUENTS TO TRY.

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.528
TO LIKE GET THATINFORMATION OUT

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.296
TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL SO I I

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:33.631
COMPLETELY IT OCCURRED CURRENT

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:34.698
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.500
FAR GREATER TRANSPARENCY GREATER

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:40.371
OPENNESS AND COM I'M GLAD YOU

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.438
AGREE ON TRANSPARENCY LOOK FOR

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:45.309
TO THAT ON IT [inaudible]

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:48.112
MR FUNG.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:49.480
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.815
I THINK THE HESITANCY I THINK A

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:52.316
LOT OF US TO ACTUALLY APPLY THE

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.684
CHAIRMAN FOR FOR HIS PUSH FOR

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.552
PLAN.

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.086
AS IS THAT VERY REASON WE'RE

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:58.255
LOOKING FOR A PLAN FROM THE DMV

00:40:58.322 --> 00:40:59.890
I KNOW THAT THERE'S FOCUS ON

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:01.992
KIOSKS FOCUS ON STAFF TO FOCUS

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:03.727
ON RESOURCE IS THERE.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:05.062
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT THE

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.131
DMV IS GOING TO PROVIDE US.

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.465
SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THAT

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.401
ALONG WITH WITH ANY FUNDING

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:11.802
REQUESTS TO TO ACTUALLY

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.270
DETERMINE WHETHER.

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:17.141
THE FUNDING AND THE PLAN WORKS.

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.142
I WOULD SAY YES IF --

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:18.976
WE GOING TO THE PROVISIONAL

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:21.078
LANGUAGE IT'S BEING --

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.580
CONSIDERED HERE --

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:24.248
IT PROVIDES FOR THAT SORT OF

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.983
REPORTING AND THE DESCRIPTION

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.052
INTO FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:29.053
HOW THEY'VE USED THAT.

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.087
WE HOPE RESOURCES THEY'VE

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.989
RECEIVED SO FAR AND HOW THEY'RE

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:33.390
GOING TO USE TO NEW RESOURCES

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.325
WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.759
THIS SO THIS PLAN HAS TO BE

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:38.095
PRODUCED AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.530
THE FUNDING REQUEST.

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:43.100
YES AND WHAT METRICS ARE THEY

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:43.901
USING A ME IS.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.669
IS THERE A SPECIFIC WAY TIME

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:46.804
THAT INTERNALLY THEY NEED TO

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:49.607
MEET IS IT FIFTEEN MINUTES IS IT.

00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:50.641
THIRTY MINUTES OVER WHAT WHAT

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.142
METRICS ARE THE UTILIZING

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:52.443
[inaudible]

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.478
I'M.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:57.481
SO IN TERMS OF MEET YES IT'S

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.450
COULD TELL BASED ON WAIT TIMES --

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:01.619
HISTORICALLY THEIR TARGET HAS

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:03.854
BEEN IF YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT --

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:07.992
THAT YOUR AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:09.894
AN APPOINTMENT YOUR SEEN WITHIN

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.794
FORTY FIVE MINUTES NOT TO SAY

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:10.995
THAT.

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.162
SAID THAT THE IDEA IS TO MAKE IT

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.597
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE THAT THOSE

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.932
THOSE KIND OF BEEN THEIR TARGET

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.100
WAIT TIMES.

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.801
AND SO --

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.436
THOSE WAIT TIMES HAVE GROWN

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:22.506
CONSIDERABLY AND THEIR GOAL IS

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:23.340
TO GET BACK TO THAT --

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:27.378
AS AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW TERMS

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:29.013
OF IT'S NOT THAT AND UP.

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:29.647
AT ANOTHER THERE'S A WOULD LIKE

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:30.648
TO GET DOWN TO AN HOUR IF YOU

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.216
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT THEY'RE

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:32.983
TRYING TO GET BACK TO THAT

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.284
[inaudible]

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.886
SO THEN. FOR US AS THE

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.122
LEGISLATURE AND FOR THE CHAIRMAN

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:40.658
IS THAT IT'S A WE CORRECT INTO

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.293
TO EVALUATE THE DMV BASED ON

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.094
THOSE WAY TYPES SO IF THEY WERE

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.195
TO REQUEST.

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:46.463
AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHOULD

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.999
EVALUATE THEIR SUCCESS OR

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.801
INABILITY TO ACHIEVE THOSE WAIT

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:51.335
TIMES BASED ON THE FIFTEEN

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:52.937
MINUTE.

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:53.938
OR WHATEVER CRITERIA THAT THEY

00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:56.674
BALLOT.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.709
I WOULD SAY THAT DOES WAIT TIMES

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:01.045
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TESTIFIED

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:02.880
AS BEING THERE STANDARD THAT'S

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.315
KIND OF THAT THE BAR THEY HOLD

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:05.082
THEMSELVES.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:08.519
TO BUT AND SO THE WAY THIS

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.054
LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.689
ANY AUGMENTATION THIS WAS TO

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.290
IDENTIFY --

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.159
HOW HOW IS THIS REDUCING THOSE

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:17.194
WAIT TIMES?

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.395
SO AND ASK THE QUESTION DEVOID

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:20.531
OF I THINK IT'S IT'S A I'M I'M

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:21.632
BEING A LITTLE I'M NOT I GUESS

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:22.633
I'M BEING MAYBE A LITTLE

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.634
CONFUSING THAT SHOULD BE.

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:31.608
HOW DOES THE DMV DEFINE SUCCESS?

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:32.843
I WOULD BE.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.812
IN IN IN OTHER HEARINGS I THINK

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:37.114
THEY HAVE TESTIFIED THAT.

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.415
IN TERMS OF WAIT TIMES THEIR

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:40.517
SUCCESS IS MEETING THAT FIFTEEN

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:41.518
MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE MINUTE

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.420
TIMEFRAME.

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:45.422
AND SO --

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.690
DID WHEN THEY ASK FOR NAY

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.058
RESOURCES THEY'LL HAVE TO BE

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.661
EXPLAINING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.261
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE CURRENT

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.196
WAIT TIME IS.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:53.697
AND HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:55.766
GOING TO REDUCE THAT WAIT TIME

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.201
AND BY HOW MUCH OKAY BECAUSE I

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.335
THINK THE CHAIRMAN IS CORRECT

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.737
ASK FOR PLAN I JUST WANT TO BE

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:01.672
ABLE TO EVALUATE ARE ALL OF US

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:02.439
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.307
PLAN.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.175
BASED ON WHAT IT SHOULD BE AND

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:07.678
SO IF IT'S FIFTEEN MINUTES AND

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:08.278
FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEY'RE

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:10.014
ASKING. FOR TWENTY SIX MILLION

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.583
OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THAT

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:14.051
IF THEY DON'T MEET THAT THEN

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:14.985
THEY SHOULD BE UP FRONT AND SAY

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.787
THEY DIDN'T MEET THAT AND THAT

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:17.554
THEY SHOULD REEVALUATE THEIR

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.056
PROCESS.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:22.126
MY CORRECT TO ASSUME THAT.

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:23.727
WELL YES IN THAT WELL.

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:25.896
I WOULD SAY YES [inaudible]

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:29.633
BUT IF THEY WERE TO COME IN FOR

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.902
REQUEST SAFER TWENTY SIX MILLION.

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:36.173
AND IT'S X. NUMBER OF POSITIONS

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.608
AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:38.942
IDENTIFY --

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:40.978
WHAT THAT HOW THAT'S BRINGING

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:42.146
DOWN THE WAIT TIME AND SO I

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.847
DON'T KNOW THAT THIRTY SIX

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:44.481
MILLION DOLLAR NUMBERS THE RIGHT

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:45.549
NUMBER --

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.051
BUT WHATEVER THAT DOLLAR IS IT'S

00:44:47.117 --> 00:44:48.118
GOING DEL VALLE YES IT WILL TELL

00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:49.853
YOU WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO AND

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.889
WHAT THE BY HOW MUCH THEY

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.524
ANTICIPATE THAT REDUCING WAIT

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.426
TIMES OKAY Y. I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.460
THE CHAIRMAN'S FUTURE HEARINGS

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.695
AND LOOK FOR THEM TO DEFINE.

00:44:58.762 --> 00:44:59.863
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET TO

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:00.497
FIFTEEN A FORTY FIVE MINUTE WAIT

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.032
TIMES?

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:04.768
I THINK IT WAS BLOOM.

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:05.936
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR --

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:07.971
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE PART OF

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.173
THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT --

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.374
THAT YOU REFERENCED --

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:14.411
EARLIER AND AND LIKE A CHAIR

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:15.579
BUDGET SUB THREE THAT HAS

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.681
OVERSIGHT OVER --

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:19.450
AT THE AT DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:20.617
VEHICLES.

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:22.453
ON A I REGRET THAT I WASN'T AT

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.720
THE HEARING.

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.556
LAST WEEK I WAS TOURING --

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:28.459
THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER OF

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:29.893
THE OF THE CAR FIRE.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.495
THAT DAY AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.297
WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT CAUGHT

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.531
FIRE BEING ANOTHER ONE OF THE

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.266
DEPARTMENTS THAT --

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:40.270
THAT WE OVERSEE AND I I WOULD

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:40.771
LIKE.

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:42.773
TO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.209
MOTOR VEHICLES TRADITIONALLY HAS

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:46.844
BEEN ONE OF THE HIGHER

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.978
PERFORMING DEPARTMENTS THAT WE

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:50.080
OVERSEE --

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:52.950
AND SO I SEE THIS --

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:55.352
A CURRENT SITUATION AS AN

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.721
ABERRATION FROM FROM THE NORM

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:00.424
AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.859
RELATIVELY --

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.894
ARE EASY TO CORRECT --

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:06.263
A WE KNOW WHAT A OF SOME OF THE

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.865
CAUSES ARE --

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:11.301
FOR THE DELAYS OR WAS IT --

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:15.439
AND AYE IT CLEARLY IT WAS NOT --

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.840
THE EXTENT OF THE WORKLOAD WAS

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:18.976
NOT PROPERLY ANTICIPATED BY BY

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:21.278
THE DEPARTMENT BUT WITH RESPECT

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.046
TO THE QUESTION ABOUT --

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:26.583
WAIT TIMES AS A METRIC OF EVERY

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:27.885
TIME THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:30.621
VEHICLES COMES AND IT PROVIDES --

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:33.223
THEIR UPDATE TO US THEY ALWAYS

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.892
TELL US ABOUT WAIT TIMES AS

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:35.959
BEING ONE OF THEIR METRICS AND

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:38.028
I'M QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY WILL

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:39.897
DO THAT AGAIN BUT THEY ALSO TALK

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:40.130
ABOUT.

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:41.665
CUSTOMER SERVICE AS A AS A

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.902
METRIC A AT THE NUMBER OF

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:45.836
CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:46.670
SERVE.

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:50.174
THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY THAT THEY

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.943
GET FROM CUSTOMERS AND THIS IS

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.645
SO ONE OF OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.880
INTERFACES WITH THE PUBLIC MORE

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.849
SO THAN --

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.551
THAN MOST --

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:03.687
AND IT'S GOOD THAT QUE OUR

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:05.289
CUSTOMER CENTRIC AND WE WANT TO

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:07.491
ENCOURAGE THEM AND REQUIRED THAT

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.859
WE WANT TO MORE THAN ENCOURAGED

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:09.193
IN ONE WEEK.

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:11.261
CHOIR THEM TO TO BE THAT WAY AND

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:15.866
AND A LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE --

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:17.434
I REALLY MET THE MARK AND THE

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.236
FEEDBACK THAT I'VE RECEIVED OVER

00:47:19.303 --> 00:47:22.372
TIME UNTIL NOW HOW ABOUT --

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:25.509
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN --

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.811
VERY POSITIVE PARTICULARLY

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:32.182
COMPARED TO YEARS AGO WHEN --

00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.218
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY SECRET OF

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.719
THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:38.722
WAS -- NOT

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.123
SEEN IT WAS IT WAS YOU KNOW WAS

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.391
SEEN AS THAT PLACE WHERE YOU

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.794
WOULD GO ONE WAY AND NEVER GET

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.431
SERVE TEN AND AND WITH --

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.132
I DON'T THINK WATCHES CALIFORNIA

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.100
DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES BUT

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.002
THIS WAS ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:54.671
THAT WAS THE* OF MANY JOKES --

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.839
ABOUT -- A

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:57.941
BUREAUCRACY AND WAIT TIMES AND

00:47:58.008 --> 00:47:58.976
THEY REALLY --

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.477
TURNED THAT AROUND SO IT'S

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:01.912
UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS.

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:03.814
UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES IT

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.850
EXISTS UP WE WILL APPROVE BE

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.820
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.488
HAD OVER THE DEPARTMENT IN THE

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.457
COMING BUDGET CYCLE --

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:15.158
I'M QUITE CERTAINLY THAT CERTAIN

00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:17.060
THAT WE WILL EXPAND OUR HEARING

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.296
TIME FROM A WHAT WE NORMALLY DO

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:21.098
WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SHORT

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.900
PERIOD OF TIME AND PERHAPS --

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:26.103
A RESERVE IN ENTIRE HEARING SO

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:29.172
THAT WE CAN PERFORM SOME OF THE

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.842
IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT AND TO

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.910
PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY.

00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:34.678
THAT -- OF

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.848
THAT THE PUBLIC SO THAT IS

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:39.316
SOMETHING GOT --

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:40.717
THAT WE WILL --

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:41.818
DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN THE COMING

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.486
BUDGET CYCLE [inaudible]

00:48:42.552 --> 00:48:44.588
THANK YOU.

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:46.957
THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER.

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.458
YES -- I WAS

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:50.861
AT THE HEARING AND AND I THINK --

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:51.662
AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.363
OBVIOUSLY WHERE WE'RE ASKING FOR

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.731
TIME AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:55.732
THE CONCERNS I HAD AS TO HOW

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.067
SOON SHOULD WE SEE.

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.603
THE RESULTS OF THE LOVE OF THE

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.804
INFUSION OF DOLLARS OF DOLLARS

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.406
ARE PLACED INTO THIS AGAIN.

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:03.407
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:04.941
ARE OFTEN WE'VE ALREADY CREATED

00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:07.110
SOME PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN IT

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.445
AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:09.880
WHETHER NOT WERE ACTUALLY GOING

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:11.348
TO RESPOND TO THOSE PARTICULAR

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.215
PROBLEMS NOW.

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:14.217
WHAT I'M HAD TO DO WITH PEOPLE

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.552
TRYING TO GET APPOINTMENTS?

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:16.620
AND THE POINT WAS WILL COMING

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:18.288
AFTER THE DATE THAT THEY WOULD

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.489
DO TO BE --

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:22.125
ALL THEIR DAY TO GET THE LICENSE

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.060
AND I KNOW THERE WAS SOME

00:49:23.126 --> 00:49:24.528
DISCUSSION THAT WE WERE THINKING

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:26.596
OF DOING. EIGHT EIGHT THIRTY TO

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:27.798
SIXTY DAYS [inaudible]

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.933
DELAY. FOR SOME OF THOSE

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.535
INDIVIDUALS AND THAT IS THAT

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:33.837
HAPPENING OR NOT I I HEARD IT AS

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.739
A DISCUSSION I HAVEN'T SEEN IT

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.673
AS A PLAN.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.308
OF MAY BECAUSE AFFECTS ME

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:40.410
PERSONALLY JUST GOT MY RENEWAL

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:41.678
AND TRY TO GET APPOINTMENTS AND

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.413
IT'S OCCURRING A MONTH AFTER MY

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.615
STUFF IS DO YOU.

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:46.216
THAT SAID I DON'T ONE OF YOU

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.150
FACE THE DMV BUT OBVIOUSLY I

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.885
MIGHT BECOME SO I'M TRYING TO

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:49.920
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WE HAVE.

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:52.089
MADE AN EFFORT TO TRY TO CORRECT

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:52.689
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:54.558
CREATED OR THAT WERE CREATED AS

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.927
A RESULT OF THE OF OF WHAT'S

00:49:56.993 --> 00:50:00.397
GOING ON HAVE WE DONE THAT.

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:03.834
YES AND SO ON I THINK THAT --

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.835
THE DISCUSSION YOU REFERENCE

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.002
SCENE HAD TO DO FIRST OF ALL

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:08.138
WITH WITH BILLING AND SO --

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.973
THAT ARE MOTOR VEHICLES NORMALLY

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.408
SENDS OUT BILLS --

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:13.210
AND AND LIKE YOUR RENEWAL NOTICE

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.911
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD GO OUT NINETY

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.046
DAYS BEFORE IT'S DUE --

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:20.083
AND STICK DEBT WITH THE TO GIV

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.585
YOU TIME.

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.653
TO RESPOND AND AND A SCHEDULED

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.255
APPOINTMENT THAT IS BEING --

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:26.490
CHANGE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.891
DAYS SO THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.593
OF EXTENDING THAT OUT SO

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:31.228
EVERYBODY WILL GET THEIR RENEWAL

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.562
NOTICES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:34.097
DAYS IN ADVANCE.

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.699
WHICH IS INTENDED TO CREATE

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:36.967
ENOUGH TIME THERE FOR CUSHION

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.969
FOR OF THOSE APPOINTMENTS.

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.404
BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OF THESE

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.172
NOTICES AND NOT GO OUT NINETY

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:42.939
DAYS IN ADVANCE THE ONE THAT I

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.474
RECEIVED.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.509
SO AS A RESULT IS MORE LIKE

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:48.879
FORTY FIVE DAYS SO YOU APPLY --

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.113
FOR TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AND

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:51.281
ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:52.549
APPOINTMENT WILL COME.

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.518
UP THIRTY OF FORTY DAYS AFTER IT

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.052
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SO YOU

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:57.053
LICENSE WILL EXPIRE AND OF THE

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.322
WORDS BEFORE YOU HAVE RENEWAL SO

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:00.257
YOU HAVE THE CHOICE.

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.625
OF EITHER GOING AND STANDING IN

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.260
LINE FOR EVER AND TRYING TO GET

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.060
IT DONE.

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:06.763
OR HAVING AN EXPIRED LICENSE

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:07.297
WHICH ALWAYS CREATED MORE

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:08.398
PROBLEMS SO I KNOW WE WERE

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.133
TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I WAS

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:10.867
ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:11.701
COMMITTEE THAT.

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:14.838
THAT THE NOTICES HAD GONE OUT.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.072
NINETY AND SO WHEN PEOPLE THEN

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.874
WENT ON THE LINE TO TRY TO GET

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:18.508
AN APPOINTMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.110
TO GREEN OF THEIR LICENSE.

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.611
THAT THEY WOULD BE BASICALLY

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.280
WHAT THE DATE PASSED THE

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.015
DEPRESSED THE EXPIRATION DATE SO

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:26.183
THE QUESTION IS AND I KNOW WAS

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.551
SOME DISCUSSION THAT WE WERE

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:28.919
GOING TO LOOK AT THAT.

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.086
AND TRY TO CORRECT THAT

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.922
SITUATION BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.323
THAT'S A SITUATION FOLKS IN NOW

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.791
VERY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY

FIELD TO APPEAR AND THAT'S

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:34.878

ELSEWHERE LA PROGRAMS ARE VERY

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:03.539
WORTHY THAT WE CAN BE A SETTING

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.041
MONEY ASIDE.

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:06.442
IF IT DID PASS THEM FOR THEIR

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:08.244

FLOOD LBS WHAT IS IN HERE.

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:23.726
AND IT IS TO A CERTAIN WITH THE

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.828
SYSTEM THE BILL IT'S IS POLICY

BUT BUT TO HAVE THIS BILL HERE I

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.904
MEAN.

THIS.

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.577

AND AND IT IS THIS IS REALLY

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:52.322
RESUME THE WRONG WAY TO HELP MY

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.323
COLLEAGUES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:56.259
THIS IS NOT HOW YOU DO BUSINESS.

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:57.226
THIS IS NOT YOU KNOW YOU DID YOU

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.429

AND ALSO THE MONEY ASIDE.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.166
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MONEY.

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.935

ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE EXPENDITURE

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:16.112
PENDING THE PASSAGE OF PRE TRIAL

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.547
REFORM LEGISLATION SO THERE

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:18.014
WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:25.521
EXPENDITURE.

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:28.224

IN YOUR BUDGET.

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:52.682
AREA IS THAT CORRECT.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.350
I DON'T RECALL SEEING IT IN MY

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.752
BUDGET AREA HIGH.

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.387
IT MEDICALLY CANNOT SPEAK TO

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.588
OVER THE FIVE AND A HALF YEARS

01:00:58.654 --> 01:00:59.389
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE

01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:01.958

HEART BUDGET SO WE'RE WE'RE

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.294

TO TO TAKE TAX DOLLARS TO PUT IN

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:12.235
A SYSTEM FOR BELL.

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:13.636
THAT HASN'T PASSED THE

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.338
LEGISLATURE YET.

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.305
JUST TO HAVE IT THERE JUST IN

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.007
CASE.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.175
AND IT'S SOMETHING YOU'VE NEVER

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.812
SEEN IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.514
SO TO CLARIFY --

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.681
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:28.217
CLARIFICATION WILL ALLEVIATE ALL

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.252
OF YOUR CONCERN BUT THIS IS A

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.720
NOT A GENERAL APPROPRIATION THIS

01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.688
IS FROM THE TRIAL COURT TRUST

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.657
FUND AND THERE WAS A AT THIS

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.125
POINT NO --

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.194
INCREASE TO THE REVENUE IN THE

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.796
TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND ALTHOUGH

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.697
THE PROVISION DOES INDICATE WHAT

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:42.465
THAT --

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.966
THERE WOULD BE AN INTENT TO

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.668
PROVIDE ENERAL FUND IN THE

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.236
FUTURE YEAR IF --

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.938
THEM IF THE EXPENDITURE OCCURS

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:51.340
AND THE PASSAGE OF PRE TRIAL

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:54.477
FORM LEGISLATION OCCURS

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.946
[inaudible] NINE A YEAH YOU

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.948
WOULD THINK IN ENDING MOST MY

01:01:59.015 --> 01:01:59.916
CONSTITUENTS WOULD THINK THAT

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.417
YOU WOULD PUT.

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.352
PASSED THE LEGISLATION AND THEN

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.021
AFTER WE PASS IT IN IT GOES IN

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.589
THE LONG.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.091
AND AFTER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.492
AND THEN AS WE COME BACK OUT OF

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.460
NEXT YEAR [inaudible]

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:12.995
IF.

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.798
THE THIS BILL REFORM WAS TO PASS.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.567
AND AND I SAY THAT IS A BIG IF

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:17.867
[inaudible]

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.368
THEN.

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.137
WE WOULD LOOK AT IT IN THE

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.972
BUDGET THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO SO

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.774
WHY WOULD WE DO IT.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.310
I MEAN YEAH I HONESTLY AB A VIEW

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:27.944
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS ANYWHERE

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.878
ELSE.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:31.447
SO WHY WOULD WE BE DOING IT HERE.

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:34.951
I THINK THE THE ISSUE IS THAT --

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.486
IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.121
IF THE LEGISLATION DOES PASS

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:40.223
THERE WOULD BE REASONABLE START

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.859
UP COSTS IN THE TWO THOUSAND

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.993
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR SO

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.027
THAT YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:47.697
THE LEGISLATOR OUGHT TO DO ALL

01:02:47.763 --> 01:02:48.831
OF OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ON

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:52.602
A WHAT IF BASIS.

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:57.406
I'M NOT SURE THAT I COULD SPEAK.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:58.040
TO HOW THE A BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:58.307
TO SHOW.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.509
YOU THAT THIS IS A WHAT IF THIS

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:00.943
HAPPENS.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.511
IN IN IF WE'RE STARTING TO

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.212
LEGISLATE BASED ON WHAT IF AND

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.782
COMMIT STATE BUDGETS TO WHAT IF.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:07.850
IS IS THIS OF ANY IN THIS ISN'T

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.852
A STANDARD PRACTICE.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.087
SO IT IS IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.421
IS SOMEBODY FROM THE PART IN A

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.556
FINANCES IS HOW WE SHOULD BE

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.992
OPERATING.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:18.861
ARE ON A WHAT IF BASIS.

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:21.063
MY RECOMMENDATION ON THE AND IN

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.265
THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT THIS

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:25.168
IS A A REASONABLE ASSUMPTION --

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:27.603
THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO THOUSAND

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:28.271
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN START UP COSTS

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:30.339
IF LEGISLATION PASS AND THE WAY

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.441
THAT THE LANGUAGES WRITTEN I

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.410
THINK THAT IT PROTECTS AGAINST

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.445
ANY UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURES IN

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:39.315
THE INTENT THAT LEGISLATION DOES

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:40.316
NOT PASS NO I THINK.

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:42.385
RUNNING A WHAT IF BUDGET IS NOT

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:45.154
US MORROW FOR THE STATE

THAT THERE'S SOME GREAT

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.862
FRUSTRATION WITH THIS PARTICULAR

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:56.098

IS UNUSUAL.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.773
THAT WE WOULD PUT THAT MONEY IN

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.741
PRIOR TO THE BILL BEING APPROVED

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.610
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE DONE THAT

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.246

TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS ALSO.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:06.709
AN INDICATION OF WHY WE THINK

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.644

SITUATION AND IT IN IN MY VIEW

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.249
AND NOT ONLY --

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.051
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.986
LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH IT CERTAINLY

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:51.620
MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE BUDGET AND

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:52.922

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.490
HAD NOTICEDIT BEFORE A A A

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.920

TERMS OF IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:45.118
IN THE TESTING FOR THAT TO

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:45.752

BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET FAST AND

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.898
WE'VE GOT TO GET BETTER BECAUSE

01:43:57.965 --> 01:43:59.366
EVERY DAY THAT WE DELAY AND

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.000

THIS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THIS

01:44:15.115 --> 01:44:18.385
ALSO FOR SIX YEARS --

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.586
THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS IN HERE

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:20.420
THAT DEAL WITH POLICY NOW LIKE

01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:22.856
TO REFER LIKE ON SOME OF THE

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:24.057
COMMENTS MADE EARLIER.

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.359
THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:26.960
I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.662
BEST A BEEN THERE --

01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:29.496
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE MOB

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:31.431
POLICY ISSUES.

01:44:31.498 --> 01:44:33.133
THAT BEING SAID [inaudible]

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.703
THE TRANSPARENT SHE'S BEEN ONE

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:37.304
OF THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE LOOKED

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:41.808
AT MAKE YOU DOUBT CAP A RELEVANT --

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:43.310
DEALING WITH THE DASHBOARD.

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:47.447
PUT IT ONLINE --

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:48.715
BUT ONE OF THE MISTAKES I THINK

01:44:48.782 --> 01:44:50.751
WE MAKE [inaudible]

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:51.885
SACRAMENTO.

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.354
IN THE ASSEMBLY.

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:56.223
IS THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:57.257
OWNERSHIP OF EVERYTHING IN THE

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.793
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.128
THEM IF YOU LOOK AT LOCAL

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:03.530
CONTROL FUNDING AND HELP CAP IT

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.565
WAS TO EMPOWER.

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:06.900
THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:07.734
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.870
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:11.038
I'VE TAKEN A GREAT --

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:12.639
LOT OF TIME IN MY OWN DISTRICT

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:14.675
TO LOOK AT HOW MY SCHOOL

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.076
DISTRICTS HAVE DEALT WITH THIS

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:16.376
[inaudible]

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:20.514
AND AND TO SUMMER SCHOOL

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.081
DISTRICTS RIGHT NEXT TO EACH

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.616
OTHER [inaudible]

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:26.553
SAME DEMOGRAPHICS --

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:29.022
ONE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:30.490
LOCAL OR DRAW FUNNY THAT HELLCAT

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.458
BECAUSE THEY EMPOWERED THEIR

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:34.728
COMMUNITIES AND THEY WOULDN'T OF

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:35.562
THE CHURCHES IN THE COMMUNITY

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:36.596
GROUPS.

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:39.566
AND THE PGA IS AND IF YOU LOOK

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.968
AT THEIR PRODUCT.

01:45:42.035 --> 01:45:43.036
IN LOOK AT THE RESULTS GIVEN TO

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:44.671
THOSE STUDENTS --

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:48.742
THE FIRST THREE GREAT FIRST

01:45:48.809 --> 01:45:50.177
SECOND THIRD YEAR OUTPERFORMING

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:53.246
SOME OF THE HIGHEST PER.

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:54.214
ACADEMICS BECAUSE SCHOOL

01:45:54.281 --> 01:45:55.048
DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT.

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:55.916
RIGHT NEXT DOOR ANOTHER ONE IS

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:57.217
FAILING.

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:59.820
BUT THEY HAVE.

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:00.454
AND THAT'S SCHOOL THEY'RE SICK

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.455
OF MY OPINION THEY HAVE NOT

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.990
ENGAGE A COMMUNITY THEY TOOK ON

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.425
THE OWNERSHIP TO THEM SOLVE TO

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:07.094
SCHOOL BOARD.

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.228
AND THE ADMINISTRATORS BECAUSE

01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:09.262
THEY KNEW BASS AND DID NOT

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:11.098
EMPOWER THE PARENTS.

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:13.366
THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE AS WE

01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:15.035
KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:17.537
YOU CAN DO FOR CHILD AND

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:20.107
EDUCATION IS APPARENT.

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:21.475
AND SECONDARY WITH THE TEACHER

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:23.076
AND THAT'S WHERE THE EMPHASIS

01:46:23.143 --> 01:46:24.344
NEEDS TO BE IN THE IN THE

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.713
COMMUNITIES EMPOWER THEM.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.849
THAT'S THE MESSAGE WE NEED TO

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:29.549
SEND DOWN AS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO

01:46:29.616 --> 01:46:32.252
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE NEED TO

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:34.054

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:37.290
US TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:37.891
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:38.792
CATEGORICAL.

01:46:38.859 --> 01:46:40.293
AND WE KNOW THAT DIDN'T WORK

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:40.594
[inaudible]

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:42.162
SO.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:43.463
DON'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:44.264

SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THEIR

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:50.704
COMMUNITIES.

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:53.039
BECAUSE YOU OPPORTUNITIES AND

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:55.509

CULTURES OF THOSE COMMUNITIES.

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:04.818

COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO.

ELECTION SYSTEMS AND I THINK

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:15.748
THAT'S GENERALLY IN THE

01:54:15.815 --> 01:54:16.849

INTENDED TO AND I THINK THIS IS

01:54:20.853 --> 01:54:22.689
RELATED TO PIECE OF LEGISLATION

01:54:22.755 --> 01:54:23.890
THAT WAS DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:25.458

APPROPRIATION --

01:54:36.736 --> 01:54:38.204
THE REST OF THE BILL I WOULD SAY

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:39.272
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.007
BUDGET AND SO THE QUESTION I ASK

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.008
MYSELF IS.

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:43.343
WHY ARE WE CONSIDERING THIS BILL

01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:45.345
IN BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I HAVE --

01:54:45.411 --> 01:54:46.479
A VERY --

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:47.747
UNFORTUNATE ANSWER TO THAT

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:49.382
QUESTION AND MY ANSWER IS THAT

01:54:49.449 --> 01:54:50.550
IT'S AN ATTEMPT BY.

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:53.353
THE LEGISLATURE TO INTERFERE

01:54:53.419 --> 01:54:56.055
SORTS OF A LOCAL ELECTION.

01:54:56.122 --> 01:54:57.390

01:54:57.457 --> 01:54:59.058
INTERFERE.

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:00.226
WELL IT'S A PARTISAN FIGHT AND

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:01.928
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME LOOK IN

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:02.795
THE PREAMBLE OF THIS BILL UNLESS

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:04.297
THE COURT CASE.

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:06.432
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO OVERTURN

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:07.967
THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE

01:55:08.034 --> 01:55:09.369
TWENTY TWO WORKERS THE CHAIRMAN

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.170
OF THE SAME WOULD HELP WITH THE

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:11.738
SAN DIEGO COUNTY REPUBLICAN

01:55:11.804 --> 01:55:13.873
PARTY --

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.676
THIS IS BEING DONE RETROACTIVELY

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:17.877
WHICH IS COUNTER TO THE CUSTOM

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:18.711
PRACTICE OF THIS BODY

01:55:18.778 --> 01:55:19.012
[inaudible]

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:22.915
AND YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHY

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:23.816
IS THIS A BUDGET BILL AND I

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:25.952
SUBMIT THE ONLY REASON WHY IT'S

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:27.787
BEING PROPOSED AS A BUDGET BILL.

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:29.789
IS THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:31.157
WE CAN APPLY THIS CHANGE WITH

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:32.659
IMMEDIATE EFFECT WITHOUT A TWO

01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.761
THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:35.328

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:38.564
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES SO.

01:55:38.631 --> 01:55:40.333
A GUY I THINK IT'S THIS IS A

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.934
DEPLORABLE INTERFERENCE ON A

01:55:42.001 --> 01:55:43.202
LOCAL ELECTION.

01:55:43.269 --> 01:55:43.803
I'M KIND OF A SHAME THAT WERE

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:45.338
DOING IT IS EXACTLY THIS KIND OF

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:46.272
ACTION.

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:48.007
THAT OUR ROADS OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:49.942
FAITH AND TRUST IN THE INTEGRITY

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:52.011
OF THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:55:52.078 --> 01:55:53.880
I DON'T THINK IT HAS A PLACE.

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.415
IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND AND

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:56.783

01:55:56.849 --> 01:55:58.818

IN COURTS COULD YOU JUST WALK ME

02:04:04.837 --> 02:04:05.704

02:05:09.635 --> 02:05:12.905
A SEEKING OF A REVIEW BY THE

OF THAT AND POT OF MONEY AND THE

02:07:19.798 --> 02:07:21.767
STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS WERE

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.569
BASICALLY --
