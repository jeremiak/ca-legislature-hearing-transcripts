DEFINITION. OF WE HAVEN'T

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.429
DECIDED ON ONE PARTICULAR

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.265
DEFINITION AS YET BUT THERE'S

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:49.866
BEEN SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THAT

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.102

WAY. OF AROUND INTENTIONALLY

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:18.929
MISLEADING COORDINATING

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.665
DECEPTIVE AND ALSO THE- THE

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.101
BEHAVIOR PIECE ALSO SO I THINK-

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.870
SO YOU KNOW THERE IS NO

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:29.673

THAT SO AGREED. AGREED TO BY

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.977
EVERYBODY AT THIS POINT I SEE

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.613
AND- I YEAH I GUESS QUESTION

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.014

FOR YOUR WITNESS ON. THIS

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:40.951
FIRST- PRONG ASKED

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.420
INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING OR

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:45.021
INACCURATE SO THERE'S AN INTENT

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:47.090
REQUIREMENT WHICH- WAS AN

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:47.924
IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD IN OTHER

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:50.193
AREAS WERE PLAYING WITH- MAKING

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.062
A JUDGMENT ABOUT. FALSENESS

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:53.797
LIKE DEFAMATION THAT YOU KNOW

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.599
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT. THIS

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.499
INTENT REQUIREMENT IT'S

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.501
IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD AGAINST A

00:53:58.568 --> 00:53:59.769
CHILLING EFFECT BUT I.

00:53:59.836 --> 00:54:03.907
WONDERING HOW THAT WORKS IN

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:04.507
THIS CONTEXT I MEAN. BECAUSE

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.075
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TOHAVE A

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:06.843
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM MAKING A

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.346
DETERMINATION IN REAL TIME-

00:54:09.412 --> 00:54:11.314
ABOUT WHAT WAS KNOWN WHAT THE

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.983
INTENT OF THE CONTENT SHARE

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:16.953
WISE- AND THEN YOU KNOW- DOES

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.188
THE SAME STANDARD HAVE TO BE

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:20.023
MET FOR EACH PERSON WHO SHARES

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:21.992
THE CONTENT AFTER THAT- OR WHAT

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.593
HAPPENS IF THEY TAKE A PIECE OF

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.061
ORIGINAL CONTENT THAT MAY BE

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.663
WHAT IS. I SHARED WITH WITH ILL

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.099
INTENT- BUT THE SCHERER DOES

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:31.034
NOT HAVE THAT SAME INTENT AND

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.936
THEY HAD SOME COMMENTARY THAN

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:35.071
THEIR OWN ORIGINAL CONTENT. SO

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:35.839
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THESE

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:38.475
QUESTIONS- THESE ISSUES BEING

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.143
RESOLVED. BUT THE LAW

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:42.212
ESSENTIALLY- PASSED THE TECH

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:44.047
COMPANY ORDER FORM TO DISCLOSE

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.915
WHETHER OR NOT THEY HOW SUCH A

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:47.050
POLICY. SO IT DOESN'T REALLY

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.552
MANDATE THE CONTENT. OF THE

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:53.590
POLICY ITSELF- OR DOES IT. NEED

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:55.091
A DOES IT COMPELS SPEECH SHELF

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.494
EXAMPLE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.864
DEFINITION OF- LET'S SAY- OF

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:08.171
THIS PATIENT. YES. IT

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:09.906
DEFINITION THAT'S OUT OF

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.141
ACCEPTED BY ALL PARTIES THAT

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:12.942
BUT- I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:14.678
CONCERN BUT YOU KNOW THE- THE

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:17.113
INTENT HERE IS TO FIND. A TO

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.982
FIND THE LOWEST- COMMON

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.950
DENOMINATOR DOT WOULD BASICALLY

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.919
FIT. ON THE DEFINITION OF THE

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.087
DEFINITION OF MISINFORMATION

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.489
ACROSS THE BOARD. ARE THERE ARE

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.525
A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED OR

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.226
THERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SOCIAL

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.594
MEDIA PLATFORMS OUT THERE. AND

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.363
SOME OF THE PLATFORM STATE YOU

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.532
HAVE POLICIES SOME DELL SO THAT

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:36.566
YOUR INTENT IS TO BASICALLY

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:38.468
CREATE ONE UNIFORM POLICY. I

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:39.869
WOULD ALLOW ALL PLATFORMS TO

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:42.739
COMPLY WITH. AND OF SO. SO

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:44.908
TAXES EXACTLY WHAT WE WORKING

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:47.444
ON THE DEFINITION OF. OKAY I

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.678
MEAN I DON'T SEE LIKE HUGE

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:51.247
PROBLEM I GUESS THE IDEA OF

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.248
DISCLOSURE BUT IT IT KIND OF

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:53.483
SEEMS LIKE THIS MIGHT BE THE

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.718
FIRST STEP DOWN HE ROAD MAYBE.

00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:57.487
AT TRYING TO ADD MORE. CLOSELY

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.923
MONITOR YEAH AND- AND YOU KNOW

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.691
REQUIRE A SOCIAL MEDIA

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.393
PLATFORMS TO MONITOR- THEIR

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.463
CONTENT FOR. FOR FAKE NEWS- AND

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:09.232
I SO I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:11.101
THE- SAFEGUARDS THAT WE'VE

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.569
RECOGNIZED AS NECESSARY TO

00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.938
PREVENT- YOU CRIMINALIZING YOU

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:17.807
KNOW FALSE STATEMENTS- FROM.

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:20.643
UNDULY BURDENING SPEECH- IT.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.246
MIGHT NOT BE WORKABLE IN THE

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:25.014
CONTEXT- THAT WE'RE DEALING

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:27.217
WITH HERE. AND SO I JUST THINK

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.385
THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:31.988
MINDFUL OF BEFORE WE GO TOO FAR

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:34.057
DOWN THIS ROAD I DO GET IT. AND

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:34.624
THE DEFINITION WAS ACTUALLY

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.693
TAKEN FROM. OUT OF THE VERBIAGE

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.228
THAT'S BEING USED BY OTHER-

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.729
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AS WELL

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:40.697
SO THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH ALIGN

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.699
WITH WHAT'S OUT THERE AS FAR AS

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:43.166
THE DEFINITION ISN'T.

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.968
DEFINITIONS CONCERT BUT I DON'T

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.836
KNOW FOUGHT FOR SYSTEMS AS

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.372
ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. SO

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.808
JUST NINETY I COULD ASK SINCE

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.777
ARE YOU STILL. THERE YES I. AT

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:56.379
THAT YOU FOR THE UP. TO VOTE ON

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:58.314
THIS I DO THINK IT'S REALLY.

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.917
THAT THIS STATUTE IS NOT

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.219
ATTEMPTING TO DO WHAT WILL GIVE

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:05.989
A CALL. IT'S JUST A EXACT WHAT.

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:14.097
A THE AFTER. WITH OF. FALSE

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:14.798
INFORMATION THAT'S BEING

00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:15.765
DISSEMINATED BROUGHT SO THE

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.167
ONLY THING THAT'S DAHLE WE IN

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:19.369
THIS BILL IS TO REQUIRE THAT

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:22.539
THE PLOT HAS TO INFORM ITS

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.240
CUSTOMERS- IT WAS THEY'RE USING

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.409
IT ALL WHETHER IT HAS A POLICY

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:28.645
OR NOT I AND OF COURSE THE

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.280
RIVER SENATE AND I CERTAINLY

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:32.749
AGREE- THAT THE POTENTIAL

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.517
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:35.485
COULD COME UP WAY WAY DOWN THE

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:38.188
ROAD COULD BE INVOLVED BECAUSE

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.923
MOST FUNDAMENTALLY THE FIRST

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:42.025
AMENDMENT DOESN'T RESTRICT. THE

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:43.960
CONDUCT OF PRIVATE PARTIES ONLY

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:46.629
DEALS WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO TO

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:48.364
THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:51.334
CONCERN HERE IT'S IN A WAY BACK

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.436
GENERATED BY THE FACT THAT WE

00:57:53.503 --> 00:57:54.437
DON'T WE DON'T OF THE NORMAL

00:57:54.504 --> 00:57:56.506
REGULATORY PROCESS IS A PLACE

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:58.775
BECAUSE PRIVATE COMPANIES THEN

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:01.277
IF PRIVATE PUMP START ACTING

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.046
ALMOST LIKE THE GUY AND THEY

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:06.449
START CENSORING EACH AND REALLY

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.917
EXPRESS WAY I THEN THAT RAY

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:09.552
REALLY IMPORT POLICY. BUT BUT

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:12.021
THIS BILL IS BACK ABOUT FOUR

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.356
STEPS WE GET TO THE PROBLEM

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.859
AREA BECAUSE ALWAYS REQUIRING

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:18.962
IS THE NOT THE IT PLATFORM

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.763
WOULD HAVE HAVE A POLICY THEY

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:26.202
JUST HAVE TO INFORM. THOSE WHO.

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:27.604
WITH EVERY STATE TO CARE ABOUT

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.638
IT WHETHER THEY HAVE A POLICY

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:31.241
HERE NOT. AND THE CON. AT LEAST

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:35.044

THAT IS MISTER KILEY SAID THIS

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.688
IS THE FIRST STEP AND WE DO

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.156
HAVE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.992
BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.927
STATISTICS THERE ARE SO MANY

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.695
PEOPLE RELYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.397
TO GET THEIR NEWS AND

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:56.799
OFTENTIMES THERE ON TROOPS

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.501
THEIR FALSE STATEMENTS

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.937
KNOWINGLY MADE FALSE STATEMENTS

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.405
SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.607
FIRST STEP AND I MOVE THE BILL.

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:07.076

BOTH. CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT. THE

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:25.561
PROBLEM OF MISINFORMATION BUT

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.230
WE APPROACH THIS IN TWO

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.599
DIFFERENT WAYS RIGHT SO. YOU

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.401
KNOW FOR ME ONE OF MY BIG

00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:33.269
CONCERNS HAS BEEN THE ACTUAL

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:34.504
CENSORSHIP THAT WE ALREADY

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.840
SEEN. ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.108
WAY THAT I APPROACH THIS IS I

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.477
THINK THAT ACTUALLY- MORE

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:45.081
SPEECH. IS WHAT ENDS UP.

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:51.254
EXPOSING THINGS FALSE AND

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:54.090
THEORIES- AND SHOWING THAT

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:55.825
THINGS ARE NOT ACCURATE MORE

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:59.362
SPEECH HELPS. BRING THAT OUT-

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.831
AND DISPEL THE MYTHS THAT ARE

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.167
OUT THERE- RATHER THAN LAST

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:06.970
SPEECH AND RATHER THAN AND

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:12.342
SUPPRESSING SPEECH- AND I DO I

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.511
WORRY THAT. NUMBER ONE I WORRY

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:16.679
ABOUT THE TECH COMPANIES

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.548
THEMSELVES THE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.116
PLATFORMS THEMSELVES YOU KNOW I

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.518
HAD LEGISLATION THAT WAS

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:25.088
FOCUSED ON NOT ALLOWING THEM TO

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.423
CENSOR SOMETHING. WE BASED ON

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.459
THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.795
SPEECH AND THERE HAVE BEEN

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:33.896
SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE THAT

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.531
APPEARS TO BE THE CASE THAT IT

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.267
WAS MORE ABOUT THE VIEWPOINT OF

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.436
THE PERSON BRINGING THAT THEN

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.538
WHETHER OR NOT AND- YOU KNOW IT

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:46.275
WAS. ACCURATE OR OR OR

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.744
CERTAINLY LIKE TO THE FORMS OF

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.112
SPEECH THAT THE CONSTITUTION AS

01:00:49.178 --> 01:00:51.481
SET ARE LESS PROTECTED

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:56.119
OBSCENITY. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY.

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:58.554
CALLS TO VIOLENCE AGAINST

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.156
PEOPLE THINGS LIKE THAT

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.090
IMMEDIATE ACTS OF VIOLENCE

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:04.127
AGAINST A PERSON'S IN GROUPS-

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.895
BUT LARGELY I THINK WE NEED TO

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.064
TRY AND KEEP A FREE MARKET OF

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.866
SPEECH BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.901
SUPPRESS ENOUGH AND I'LL I'LL

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.369
GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THEM. I

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:15.772
THINK IT REALLY WE REALLY SEEN

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:19.242
THAT IT WORKS WHEN IT COMES. TO

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.943
MAJOR PUBLIC FIGURES FOR

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.912
INSTANCE JUST YESTERDAY YOU

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.147
KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH HAD

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:27.050
TWEETED ABOUT JOE SCARBOROUGH.

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:28.951
AND PERHAPS IN BEING INVOLVED

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:30.153
WITH THE DEATH OF ONE OF HIS

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:30.953
INSURANCE AND IT WAS

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.889
IMMEDIATELY CALLED OUT BY

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.624
ALMOST ALL THE NEWS AND- AND

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:35.725
ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAYING

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.393
THAT AS A CONSPIRACY THEORY

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:39.128
THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN FALSE.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.930
IT'S ALMOST IMMEDIATELY JUMPED

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.432
ON AND THE MARKET OF FREE

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.901
SPEECH. BASICALLY CALLED THAT

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.636
OUT RIGHT AND I THINK WE CAN

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.504
LOOK TO MANY DIFFERENT CASES

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:52.341
WHERE THAT IS BEEN. THE CASE-

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.110
WHERE WE WHERE WE SEEM TO HAVE

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:57.980
SOME PROBLEM- IS REALLY AND

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:03.119
EXAMPLE BOX THAT ARE OUT THERE-

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.055
THIS WAS. MOST OF THE CALLED

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:07.156
OUT THE MODEL REPORT FOR THE

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.724
MOVE PART SAID THAT THESE

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.426
RUSSIA BOUGHT. WHAT THEY WERE

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:11.828
DOING IS THEY WERE ACTUALLY

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:15.264
POSING AS FOR EXAMPLE A BLACK

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:18.234
LIVES MATTER GROUP WHERE THEY

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.069
WERE POSING AS A TEA PARTY.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:22.105
GROUP AND THEY WERE STILL KEEN

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.774
REALLY THE FIRE. AND STOKING

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.944
THE INDIVIDUAL- PASSIONS OF

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:30.613
THESE GROUPS- USING FALSE

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.948
NARRATIVES THAT WEREN'T EVEN

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.916
ACTUALLY TRUE BUT THEY GOT THAT

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.685
GROUP. TO BE ANIMATED

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:38.287
IMMOBILIZED- THOSE ARE THOSE

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.256
ARE THE AREAS WHERE IT'S MORE

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:44.293
SURREPTITIOUS WHERE. YOU WANT

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.928
SPEECH TO BE ABLE TO CALL THOSE

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:48.164
THINGS OUT AND I GUESS TO MY

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:49.899
COLLEAGUES POINT ABOUT. LOOK

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.334
MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.635
SOCIAL MEDIA AGAIN THEIR NEWS

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:53.970
THERE BUT WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:57.373
IS IT. TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.442
AND TO BE PUBLICLY INFORMED

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:02.411
IT'S THE PER IS THE INDIVIDUAL

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:04.480
AND- THAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.149
AT DIFFERENT VIEW POINT YOU

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:09.819
SHOULD BE YOU SHOULD BE EXPOSED

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.287
YOU SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO MANY

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.623
DIFFERENT. YOU SHOULD JUST

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.591
LISTEN TO FOX NEWS OR YOU

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.393
SHOULD JUST LISTEN TO CNN.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.996
RIGHT SAID TO ME THE ANSWER IS

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.532
MORE SPEECH IT'S AS AND NOT

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:23.699
FINDING WAYS ACTUALLY SUPPRESS

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:25.601
BEACH AND MY CONCERN WITH YOUR

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.670
BILLS YEAH THE FIRST LEVEL IT'S

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.605
JUST ASKING THEM TO SAY DO WE

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:33.176
HAVE A POLICY. BUT WE ALREADY

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:34.343
KNOW THAT THERE'S BILLS BY

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.945
SENATOR PAN FOR EXIT FOR

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.247
EXAMPLE THEY'RE LOOKING TO HAVE

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.816
A PLAN TO TELL YOU KNOW PLAN A

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.885
FRAMEWORK FOR HOW SPEECH SHOULD

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.787
BE HANDLED ON THESE PLATFORMS

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:45.421
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.557
LEAD TO MORE SUPPRESSION WERE

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:49.192
ALREADY SEEN IT ON THE

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:51.494
PLATFORMS THEMSELVES. WHERE

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.396
THEY'RE CENSORING SPEECH. AND

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.097
THE MORE THE GOVERNMENT GETS

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.933
INVOLVED I GET REALLY CONCERNED.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.334
BECAUSE IN GOVERNMENT STARTS

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.669
DETERMINING BASED ON THEIR

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:02.371
PLAN- BASED ON SOME DEFINITION

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:04.173
THAT WE MIGHT COME UP WITH.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.210
WHAT CONSTITUTES TRUE NEWS AND

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:08.711
FAKE NEWS AND IT'S NOT THE

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.279
GOVERNMENT'S PLACE TO DO THAT

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:14.684
IT REALLY IS NOT- AND THE

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.053
PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.255
GOVERNMENT CAN BEGIN THE USE

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.823
THAT POWER TO SUPPRESS

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:23.859
LEGITIMATE VIEWPOINTS ONCE A

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.861
DAY DON'T AGREE WITH SUB SUB

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:29.599
SUPPRESS CRITICISM EVEN

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:30.967
GOVERNMENT AND I'M A PROFESSOR

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.802
SIMS YOU KNOW YOU BROUGHT THAT

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:33.869
UP THAT. DOWN THE ROAD THIS

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:35.371
COULD BECOME MORE OF A PROBLEM.

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.773
I BELIEVE THAT. THE SOCIAL

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.542
MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:40.543
MUCH MORE LIKE A LIMITED PUBLIC

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.879
FORUM WHICH THERE HAS BEEN CASE

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.948
LAW SAYING LOOK IN LIMIT PUBLIC

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.117
FORMS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW FOR

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.719
FREE SPEECH AND THE EVEN THOUGH

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.554
THESE ARE PRIVATE AREAS. THESE

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:54.090
ARE PRIVATE COMPANIES BECAUSE

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.891
THESE NOW HAVE BECOME A FORM

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.226
I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.761
ON THE BERKELEY CAMPUS AS AN

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:02.164
UNDERGRADUATE. THERE WAS NOT IT

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.100
IN SPROUT PLAZA THERE WAS ALL

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.801
KINDS OF YOU POINTS. BEING

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:08.571
EXPRESSED OUT THERE AND I WOULD

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:09.171
SAY THERE'S EVEN THINGS THAT I

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.439
WOULD SAY THAT IS. THAT'S FALSE

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.775
IS NOT EVEN TRUE RIGHT. AND

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.278
YET. BECAUSE THAT WAS A PUBLIC

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.012
FORUM WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:18.381
RIGHT TO SAY YOU KNOW THE BIRTH

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:20.650
OF THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT. WE

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.685
DIDN'T TRY TO SUPPRESS. PEOPLE

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:26.222
SPEECH- WE USED OUR SPEECH TO

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.291
SAY HEY HERE'S WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.959
IN HERE'S WHAT WE THINK IS TRUE.

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.661
AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR IS THE

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.362
ULTIMATE DISINFECTANT IS THE

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:36.365
ULTIMATE. TRUTH TELLER BECAUSE-

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:37.600
TRUTH WILL OF TRUTH WILL

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.670
EVENTUALLY RISE. TO THE TOP IT

MOVING TOO FAR INTO THE SPACE

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.014
FOR ACTUALLY GONNA ALTERNATELY

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.351
SUPPRESS LEGITIMATE VIEW POINTS

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:57.420
WE'RE GOING TO WEAR THIS COULD

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.690

WANT TO BELIEVE THAT'S KIND OF

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.776
A FUNDAMENTAL CORNERSTONE OF

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.011
THIS COUNTRY AND IF THE

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:23.245
GOVERNMENT STARTS GETTING TOO

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.180
FAR INTO THAT WILL WE'RE GOING

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.648

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.206
DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE

01:06:50.272 --> 01:06:52.041
SHOULD NOT SUPPRESS. A SPEECH

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:53.709
WHATSOEVER BECAUSE WE THAT'S

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:54.877
WHAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS ALL

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:58.714
ABOUT THAT. AND THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:58.781 --> 01:06:59.815
MEASURE DOES NOT SUPPRESS

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.684
SPEECH- AS MENTIONED BY

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.720
PROFESSOR SAM AND- AND IT DOES

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:07.022
NOT. EITHER ENCOURAGE OR

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:10.526
DISCOURAGE SPEECH. IT DOES NOT-

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.695
COMPELS SPEECH. ARE WE DID

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.363

KIND OF. PIGGY BACK ON THAT AND

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:19.668
THAT IS SO I THINK. OFTENTIMES

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.637
WE NEED TO KIND OF. A SEEK A

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.939
BALANCE BETWEEN. OF CORPORATE

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.207
RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPANY

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.609
RESPONSIBILITY SOCIAL

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.879
RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT LET'S SEE

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:30.946
WHAT THE USERS OUT THERE NEED.

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.582
AT THIS DAY AND AGE I THINK

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:36.452
PEOPLE UP THERE ARE HUNGRY FOR

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:37.620
INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHAT

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:41.724
SOCIAL MEDIA IS PROVIDING. THE

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.326
PROBLEM IS A LOT OF SENSE TIONS

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.896
SIR RATED. NOW WHAT JUST ONE.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.164
THIS DOES IS ESSENTIALLY AS

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.832
MENTIONED EARLIER ONLY TO WE-

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:50.933
DOT PLOT FOR TO DISCLOSE

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.868
WHETHER THEY- ARE THEY HAVE

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:54.670
SUCH A POLICY. TO ADDRESS THE

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.839
ISSUE OF MISINFORMATION. DOES

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.974
NOT IS CONTENT NEUTRAL IT IS

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:01.510
SAW TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. SO

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:02.812
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:08:02.878 --> 01:08:05.247
FIRST DIMINISH IT NOW. AS TO

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.549
YOUR FEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW GOING

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.284
TO STEP TO STEP FORWARD I MEAN

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.852
THAT'S IN THE FUTURE I MEAN. I

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.821
DO NOT INTEND TO GO ANY FURTHER

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.088
THAN THIS AT LEAST FOR THE

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.424
MOMENT. SO I THINK IT'S A

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.993
BALANCING ACT BETWEEN LET'S SAY

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.695
OF. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.331
OUR SOCIETY AND WHAT THE USERS.

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.999
NEED TO KNOW BECAUSE THESE

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:25.801
USERS OF JUST LAY PEOPLE STATE

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.169
THEY DON'T KNOW ANY DIDN'T THEY

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.571
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.206
SOPHISTICATION WHEN IT COMES TO

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.174
FAKE NEWS FOR EXAMPLE. SO HOW

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:34.009
WOULD THEY DISCERN WHAT IS TRUE

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:36.345
AND WHAT IS NOT TRUE. SO THAT

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:38.347
HAS TO BE DOLLARS WHICH- THE

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:40.282
PLATFORMS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.451
HOW MUCH DID THEY DO. YOU KNOW

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:45.287
IN THIS EQUATION. TO DATE FACT

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.188
CHECK SHOULD THEY REMOVE THE

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.590
CONTENT WELL SHOULD THEY JUST

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.525
DO A DISCLOSURE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:51.560
THIS BILL DOES IT'S A SIMPLE

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.095

DIFFICULT THING. TO PROVE

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.169

SAYING OKAY LOOK. WE UNDERSTAND

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:31.680
THAT WHEN PEOPLE POST

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:34.283
SOMETHING. IT IS THEIR OPINION.

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:35.117

THE MOST TROUBLING OR IS OUR

OBSCENITY. CHILD **** THIS BILL

IS WAY BACK FROM THAT BOUNDARY

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:02.264
BECAUSE IT'S NOT DEALING WITH

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.132
THE CONTENT AT ALL IT'S

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:06.702

CERTAIN SERVICE TO MAKE CERTAIN

DISCLOSURE THOSE USING THE

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:14.843
PLATFORM. AND IT'S I BELIEVE

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.912
WELL DESIGNED TO LET PEOPLE

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:19.848
FIGURE OUT. TO SOME DEGREE HOW

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:21.350
MUCH RELIANCE TAKING PLACE AND

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.151
WHAT THEY SEE YOU KNOW IF THEY

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:24.353
KNOW THAT THERE'S NO POLICY WE

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:27.222
DON'T CENSOR THIS MATURE WE

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:27.723
DON'T LOOK AT IT AT ALL

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:30.025
ANYTHING GO WELL THEN. MOST

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:31.393
PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.962
IN. LOOKING AT THE JOB THEY'RE

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:38.967
DECIDING WHETHER IT'S CREDIT.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:43.205
RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER JOHN

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:44.273
HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.441
TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT IT

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.710
ACTUALLY SAYS NOT WHAT. FEARFUL

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.212
IT IT MIGHT SAY DOWN THE LINE

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.247
AND I AGREE IT'S JUST A NOTICE

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:56.418
BILL. AND WHETHER A PLATFORM

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:59.454
HAS A POLICY EXPLICITLY OF NOT

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.623
TOUCHING ANY OF THIS WAR HAS A

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:03.992
MORE NUANCED POLICY THAT IS

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.727
INFORMATION TO THE END USER

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.362
BECAUSE IT END USER ESPECIALLY

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:09.131
THINK OF IT IN THE CONTEXT OF.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.198
THE PARENTS HELPING A CHILD

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:13.802
DECIDE. HOW TO FILTER. WHAT IS

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.771
COMING OFF OF A OF A WEBSITE

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.506
WELL WORLD OF A SOCIAL MEDIA

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:20.075
PLATFORM THE INFORMATION THAT

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.844
THERE IS. NO CONCERN FOR

01:16:22.911 --> 01:16:24.913
FILTERING AT ALL ON THAT. TOP

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.282
PLATFORM OR THAT THERE IS SOME

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:29.451
I THINK IS VERY USEFUL. THE

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:34.289
BECAUSE- THE INFORMATION COMING

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:35.757
OUT OF THIS BROAD THING THAT WE

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.859
CALL THE INTERNET IS SO

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.394
PROLIFIC IT IS SO RIGHT ONE OF

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:40.762
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I THINK

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.898
WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY IS

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.200
FILTERING INFORMATION WE HAVE.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.869
AND I ACTUALLY WISH THAT. THE

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.638
INDUSTRY WOULD COME UP WITH.

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:53.208
DISCLOSURE THE BULLS THAT MAKE

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.311
IT EASIER FOR A USER TO

01:16:56.378 --> 01:16:58.613
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RISK MAY OR

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.315
MAY NOT BE WITH RESPECT TO THAT

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.651
SITE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:03.885
YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND I

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.153
APPRECIATE THAT YOU WORKING OUT

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.054
BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS OR

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.990
REALLY GOING TO MATTER IN HERE

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.725
AND I THINK IF THIS WAS GOING

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.760
TO IN FACT REGULATORS STEP INTO

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.395
REGULATIONS BECAUSE I AGREE

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.364
THAT THAT IS A KIND OF A

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.431
DANGEROUS PLACE TO GO BUT I

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:20.068
THINK IT'S VERY USEFUL FOR A

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.571
USER OF. ANY PLATFORM. TO HAVE

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.873
A COMMUNICATION FROM WHOEVER'S

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.342
RUNNING THAT PLATFORM TO SAY

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:29.344
OUR POLICY IS NO POLICY WHICH

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.780
IS A POLICY OR OUR POLICY IS

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.315
THESE GUIDELINES WHICH IS A

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:36.985
MORE. ENUMERATED POLICY THAT'S

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.687
INFORMATION THAT THAT A USER

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.222
CAN BE USED TO DECIDE WHETHER

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.957
OR NOT THEY WANT TO INTERACT OR

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.159
HOPEFULLY. TO FILTER THE

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:45.193
INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.795
GETTING SO THAT BECAUSE THE

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:47.863
USER DOES NEED TO TAKE

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:49.398
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DO

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:51.199
WITH THAT INFORMATION. THE MORE

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:52.934
THEY UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.937
VERACITY FOR THE CONTROLS THAT

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.172
MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE ARE NOT

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.407
THAT I'M SUGGESTING WE PUT

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.008
CONTROLS ON THERE BECAUSE I

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:00.742
THINK THAT THAT BECOMES

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.477
TROUBLING. BUT AT LEAST A

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:05.047
STATEMENT. THAT IS COMMON

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:08.116
ACROSS PLATFORMS SO THAT TE

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.751
USER HAS AN ABILITY TO SAY.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.453
OKAY I'M GONNA BE GETTING

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.587
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING HERE

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.955
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO CONTROLS

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.791
OVER FALSE INFORMATION OR

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.859
THERE'S AT LEAST AN ATTEMPT. TO

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.728
CONTROL FALSE INFORMATION THIS

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.464
IS WHAT IT IS. THEN THE USER

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.598
COULD DECIDE I AGREE WITH THAT

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.700
OR AYE THOSE CONTROLS OR I

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:26.468
DISAGREE WITH THOSE CONTROLS

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.637
AND MAKE A DECISION AND THAT'S

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:29.704
WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.773
THAT'S WHY THIS IS APPROPRIATE

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.275
AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT IS

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:34.643
JUST A NOTIFICATION WE'RE

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.878
ASKING. THE PLATFORMS TO SAY

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.680
WHAT IT IS YOU DO SO THAT THE

01:18:38.747 --> 01:18:42.184
END USER HAS BETTER INFORMATION.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.385
TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.019
OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO RELY ON

01:18:44.086 --> 01:18:45.353
THAT INFORMATION OR WHAT

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.923
THEY'RE GOING TO DO. WITH THAT

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:48.723
THAT SITE WERE THAT PLATFORM.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:52.461
SO I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.296
AT THIS POINT THIS WOULD BE

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:57.599
USEFUL INFORMATION. AND THERE

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:58.967
ARE OTHER AREAS I THINK THAT

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.569
THE INDUSTRY COULD DO A BETTER

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:01.937
JOB OF INFORMING CONSUMERS

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.505
ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WITH

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.006
INFORMATION THAT WOULD LEAD TO

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.308
CONSUMERS MAKING BETTER

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.176
DECISIONS THAT MAYBE AYBE NOT.

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:09.411
BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.346
WOULD IT WOULD BE USEFUL IN

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.814
THAT CONTEXT SO I THAT I

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.015
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:15.383
HERE I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.051
YOURE WORKING WITH THE

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.419
OPPOSITION BECAUSE THOSE

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:18.787
DEFINITIONS ULTIMATELY ARE

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.956
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. IN HOW A

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.625
USER DECIDES. HOW TO FILTER

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:24.726
WHAT THEY'RE GETTING BASED ON

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:25.861
THE INFORMATION THAT THIS IS

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.129
GOING TO ASK. FOLKS TO PUT

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.463
FORWARD AND WE ARE SO FAR I

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.398
THINK WE'RE SO FAR AWAY FROM.

01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:32.467
ANY CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.702
THAT THIS IS PERFECTLY

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.537
APPROPRIATE FOR. OUR COMMITTEE.

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.099
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR THE

THE LAW SAYS LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:22.984
IS NOT ENOUGH. THE LAW REQUIRES

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.118
THE MINERS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.788

THE MINOR'S BEHALF. THIS IS A

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.627

RECOGNIZE THE CHANGING NATURE

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:39.934
FAMILY. THIS BILL WOULD STILL

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:42.370
REQUIRE THESE LEGAL GUARDIANS

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:44.138

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:49.644

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.693
EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF

PLAINTIFFS THAT MAY PURSUE A

WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION ON BEHALF

01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.332

ALLOWS LEGAL GUARDIANS TO STEP

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.403

WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION. STEPPING

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.119

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:33.655

UNDER YOUR BILL AS PROPOSED

SO HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK. THEY

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.124
ARE JUST THE LEGAL GUARDIAN

01:30:30.191 --> 01:30:32.360
JUST AS THE PARENT WOULD NOT

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:32.894

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.862

THAT THE PARENT WOULD BE ABLE

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:43.004
TO. TO FILE A CLAIM BUT HERE

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.473
SIMPLY BEING A PARENT ALLOWS IN

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.542
THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RIGHT

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:49.977

DECEDENT THE DECEDENT'S LEGAL

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:10.264
GUARDIAN WOULD TAKE THE PLACE

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:11.365
OF THE PARENTS OR WHATEVER

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.835
RIGHT THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE IN

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:15.903
BRINGING FORTH THE LAWSUIT THAT

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.272
LEGAL GUARDIAN WOULD STEP IN

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:22.076
THEIR SHOES. OKAY. ARE THERE

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.212
SOME AND MAYBE SOME OF ONE OF

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:27.148
THE WITNESSES COULD. WHAT ARE

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:28.516
SOME OF THE REASONS WHY A LEGAL

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.651
GUARDIAN MIGHT NOT PROCEED WITH

01:31:30.718 --> 01:31:34.755
ADOPTION I'M THINKING IN MOST

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:35.323
OF THESE CASES IS USUALLY A

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:38.593
CHILD INVOLVED. WHAT ARE SOME

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:39.727
REASONS LEGAL GUARDIAN MIGHT

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:40.928
NOT MOVE TOWARDS ADOPTION

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.330
BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:44.932
DOESN'T A DOCTOR IF. YOU CAN

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.068
BRING ROB WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIM

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:49.770
RIGHT. I'M SURE THERE ARE A

01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:52.607
MYRIAD OF REASON IT MAY JUST

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.543
BE TIMING- IF- NEIL GULLIBLE

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.212
OUGHT TO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:02.783

ME ALSO RESPOND TO YOUR FIRST

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:07.021
QUESTION JUST BRIEFLY SO THE

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:08.890
LEGAL GUARDIAN STEP INTO THE

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.725
SHOES OF THE PARENTS THAT HAVE

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:13.094
THE SAME RIGHT TO SAY WHAT. IF

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.564
THE MINER WHO PASSED AWAY HAD A

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:20.067
SURVIVING SPOUSE OR A CHILD.

01:32:20.134 --> 01:32:22.603
THEN UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.438
THE LAW SAYS THE PARENTS COULD

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:26.941
ONLY BRING A CLAIM IF THEY WERE

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.876
FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT TO SOME

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:34.148
EXTENT. ON THE MIND. SO UNDER

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:36.317
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES A LEGAL

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:38.152
GUARDIAN WOULD HAVE TO PROVE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:40.955
FINANCIAL DEPENDENCY BUT ABSENT

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:44.258
A SPOUSE. OR CHILD OF THE

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:46.694
DECEASED MINOR THEN THE LEGAL

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:49.664
GUARDIANS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.465
BRING A CLAIM JUST AS THE

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:52.900
PARENTS WOULD WITHOUT HAVING TO

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.769
PROVE FINANCIAL DEPEND SO IN

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.637
OTHER WORDS. THE LOFTY AND DOES

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.973
IT IS THE LEGAL GUARDIANS JUST

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.541
STEP INTO THE SHOES OF THE PAIR.

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:04.178

SAY THAT THERE'S AT LEAST TWO

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.882
THINGS THAT COME TO MIND ONE IS

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:09.917
THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:12.553
AND IT CAN ALSO BE EXPENSIVE-

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.588
THERE'S A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO.

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:15.790
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT POP

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.525
PROCESS HIGHER FAMILY LAW

ATTORNEYS- AND GO THROUGH A

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.162
LINK TO YOUR PROCESS TO HAVE

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:23.331
THAT HAPPEN. AND IT'S MUCH LESS

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.599
EXPENSIVE AND MUCH LESS ONEROUS

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:26.701
FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH THE

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.169
PROCESS OF BECOMING A LEGAL

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:31.372
GUARDIAN- WHICH IS SHORTER LESS

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.240
EXPENSIVE AND SO THAT IS A LOT

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.009
OF THE REASON WHY THEY TEND TO

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:37.078

QUESTIONS COMMENTS THIS

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:49.410
GALLAGHER. YEAH SO. I THINK THE

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:51.345
LARGEST CONCERN IS THAT THIS

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:54.281
MAY BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL- AS A

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:56.683
VIOLATE ARTICLE FOUR SECTION

01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:58.952
SIXTEEN. WHICH REQUIRES THAT A

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:01.054
LOCAL OR SPECIAL STATUTE IS

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:06.460
pCAN BE MADE APPLICABLE- SO THE

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:09.029
QUESTION BECOMES- AND THE

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:10.130
REASON THAT'S IN THERE IS WHY

01:41:10.197 --> 01:41:11.732
NOT DO IT GENERAL STATUTE THAT

01:41:11.799 --> 01:41:15.302

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:18.806
COLLECT. ALL THE PENALTIES- AND

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:19.907
NOT SHARE THEM WITH THE

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:22.543
COUNTIES WHY WE DO THIS ONLY

01:41:22.609 --> 01:41:24.511
FOR ONE. JURISDICTION SO I

01:41:24.578 --> 01:41:27.481
THINK THERE IS A- YOU'RE VERY

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:28.182
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:30.284
ISSUE THERE THAT WE WOULD BE

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:34.388
CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT MAYBE I

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.622
JUST GOT I MEAN AND I'M HEARING

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.025
I HEARD SOME OF THE TESTIMONY

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.026
OTHER THINGS BEING HIGHLIGHTED

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:41.495
AS- THINGS THAT THE CITY

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:42.763
ATTORNEY WOULD WANT TO GO AFTER

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.132
PROBABLY THINGS THAT EVERY CITY

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:46.967
AND CALIFORNIA PROBABLY DEALS

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.269
WITH IN SOME ASPECT AND YET

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.538
THEY ALSO HAVE THE SAME

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:52.673
PROVISION THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:57.478
SHARE- WITH THE COUNTIES. SO I

01:41:57.544 --> 01:41:58.045
GUESS I'M TRYING TO SEE LIKE

01:41:58.111 --> 01:42:00.314
WHAT IS. WHAT IS MAYBE SO

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.783
FUNDAMENTALLY GOING ON IN SAN

MAY BE A CHOICE OF WHICH SCHOOL

SUBSTANCE OF THE AGREEMENT. THE

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:20.259
ONE COULD REASONABLY ANTICIPATE

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:22.261
AS THE BASIS FOR ANY DISPUTE.

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:23.662
MIDDLE SEXUAL ASSAULT IS AN

INJURY OF AN ALTOGETHER

02:08:24.963 --> 02:08:26.165
DIFFERENT KIND THAT WOULD NOT

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:27.900
BE UNDERSTOOD AS SUBJECT TO

02:08:27.966 --> 02:08:29.234
ARBITRATION BY A REASONABLE

02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:31.270
PARENT MUCH LESS BY A MINOR

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.838
STUDENT WHO LIKELY WAS NOT

AWARE OF THE CAUSE OR THE

02:08:34.773 --> 02:08:36.708
CONCEPT OF ARBITRATION AT ALL.

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:38.077
IT IS TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL

02:08:38.143 --> 02:08:39.745
ARBITRATION ACT HAS A BROADLY

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:42.181
PREEMPTIVE THE FACT. ON STATE

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.283
LAWS LIMITING ARBITRATION. BUT

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:45.651
THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:48.020
MINOR CAN DECIPHER MY CONTRACT

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:49.488
THAT'S A DISTINCT QUESTION OF

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.590
STATE LAW AND NOT GOVERNED BY

02:08:51.657 --> 02:08:53.859
THE FAA ITSELF. CALIFORNIA LAW

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:55.427
IN FACT ALREADY ALLOWS JUST

02:08:55.494 --> 02:08:56.962
AFFIRMING CONTRACTS AND SEVERAL

02:08:57.029 --> 02:09:00.032
CONTACTS. WELL IT'S POSSIBLE

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:01.400
THAT A COURT WOULDFIND NEVER

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:05.170
THE LESS THAT AB EIGHT THREE

ARBITRATION IN A WAYTHAT

TRIGGERS FAA PREVENT PREEMPTION

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:13.645
I AM. NOT AWARE OF ANY EXISTING

PRECEDENT TO THAT EFFECT AND I

02:09:15.147 --> 02:09:16.548
BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT FOR A

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:19.318
CONTRARY HOLDING IS COMPELLING

02:09:19.384 --> 02:09:21.520
GIVEN THE BILL'S NARROW SCOPE

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.021
AND THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES IT

02:09:23.088 --> 02:09:25.023
ADDRESSES NAMELY- THE BILL

02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:27.259
CREATES A RIGHTS INTO JUST A

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:29.394
FIRM. THAT IS NOT TARGETED AT

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:32.531
ARBITRATION AS SUCH BUT IS

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.166
LIMITED TO THAT PORTION OF AN

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:37.169
ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT- WHERE

02:09:37.236 --> 02:09:39.238
JUST AFFIRMING- THE CONTRACT

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:42.040
IS- WORKABLE AND REASONABLE IN

02:09:42.107 --> 02:09:44.042
OTHER WORDS- WE I WOULDN'T BE

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:46.245
REASONABLE TO HAVE A STUDENT BE

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.413
ABLE TO SIMPLY- DISA FIRM THEIR

02:09:49.348 --> 02:09:50.382
POINT BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST

CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENTED BY THIS

02:10:00.325 --> 02:10:02.928

DIRECTLY RELATED TO BE DRESSING

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:39.725
SCHOOLS ARE TAKING FOR FAILING

02:11:39.791 --> 02:11:41.426
TO TAKE TO PREVENT CRIMINAL

02:11:41.493 --> 02:11:42.928
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON THEIR

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:45.631
PREMISES. EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC

02:11:45.697 --> 02:11:49.601
IS THE IMPACT OF ARBITRATION ON

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:50.168
A VICTIM OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:50.969
ASSAULT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.704
IT CLEAR THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.740
DECIDE A MATTER BEFORE THEM NOT

02:11:54.806 --> 02:11:56.341
ON THE BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW

02:11:56.408 --> 02:11:58.010
OR THE RULES OF EVIDENCE.

02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:59.544
RATHER SOLELY ON AMBIGUOUS

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:01.913
NOTIONS OF EQUITY AS PERCEIVED

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:03.715
BY THAT ARBITRATOR OFTEN A

02:12:03.782 --> 02:12:05.284
SINGLE PERSON WITH HIS OR HER

02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:07.953
OWN BIASES AND PRECONCEPTIONS.

02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:09.187
THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR

02:12:09.254 --> 02:12:10.756
CAN BLATANTLY IGNORE THE LAW

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:12.257
AND PREVENT IT STUDENT WHO IS

02:12:12.324 --> 02:12:13.258
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FROM

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.926
OBTAINING THE JUSTICE THEY

02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:15.427
COULD OBTAIN THROUGH THE

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:18.664
COURTS. AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:19.665
ONE WOULD FIX THAT PROBLEM BY

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:21.033
ALLOWING STUDENTS TO DEATH THE

02:12:21.099 --> 02:12:22.501
FIRM THOSE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:23.769
AFTER BEING THE VICTIM OF A

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.704
SEXUAL ASSAULT. I SHOULD

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:28.106
EMPHASIZE THAT AB THIRTY TWO

02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:28.707
SEVENTY ONE HAS A VERY NARROW

02:12:28.774 --> 02:12:30.442
SCOPE AND PROVISIONS ARE ONLY

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:31.376
TRIGGERED WHEN THERE IS

02:12:31.443 --> 02:12:33.078
CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.614
FORM THE BASIS OF DISPUTED

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:36.915
CLAIM. CALIFORNIA CONVICTED

02:12:36.982 --> 02:12:38.784
WILL ALL THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:39.751
ESCAPE THE COURT SYSTEM AND

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:41.753
AVOID THE PUBLIC RECONCILIATION

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.522
PROCESS THAT THESE COMMUNITIES

02:12:43.588 --> 02:12:45.624

SEXUAL PREDATORS IN OUR SCHOOL.

02:13:19.558 --> 02:13:20.559
THIS IS NOT BEEN THE PATH OF

02:13:20.625 --> 02:13:22.294
LEAST RESISTANCE AMONG THE MANY

02:13:22.361 --> 02:13:23.695
UGLY TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED ON

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:25.997
THIS JOURNEY IS THAT MANY WOULD

02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:26.631
PREFER THIS ISSUE NEVER SEE THE

02:13:26.698 --> 02:13:29.234
LIGHT OF DAY. THERE ARE FEW

02:13:29.301 --> 02:13:29.801
THINGS WORSE THAN HARMING A

02:13:29.868 --> 02:13:32.204
CHILD. ONE MIGHT BE PREVENTING

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.905
THAT SHOCKING SEEKING JUSTICE

02:13:33.972 --> 02:13:35.507
FOR THAT HARM IGNORING THAT IT

02:13:35.574 --> 02:13:38.043
EVER HAPPENED. FOUR YEARS AGO

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.611
OUR CHILD WAS REPEATEDLY AND

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:41.480
BRUTALLY RAPED BY A TEACHER AT

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:43.615
REDWOOD SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES

02:13:43.682 --> 02:13:44.983
NEARLY EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:48.220
MONTHS BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS.

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:50.088
RVTRADER REMOTELY CONVICTED AND

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:52.190
SERVING TIME. OUR CHILD HAS

02:13:52.257 --> 02:13:53.392
BEEN PERMANENTLY CHANGED

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:55.127
DAMAGED AND SCARRED BY THE

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:56.495
THEORIES OF A FAULT. THE

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:58.363
ANGUISH PAIN AND MISERY COUPLED

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:00.332
WITH THE LOSS OF INNOCENCE HAVE

02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:01.032
BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:03.402
CHALLENGING. HEIGHTENED BY THE

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:05.570
FACT THAT OUR CHARLES NEVER GOT

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:07.839
THE PROVERBIAL DAY IN COURT. A

02:14:07.906 --> 02:14:09.307
JURY TRIAL WOULD BE IN ONE WAY

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:09.975
TO BRING ABOUT A FULL

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.743
INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME AND

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.512
SCHOOLED POLICIES PROCEDURES

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:14.813
GUIDELINES GOVERNANCE AND

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:17.449
CULTURE WHICH MAY HAVE

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:18.183
CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME.

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.117
INSTEAD THE CIVIL JUSTICE

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:20.419
SYSTEM DID NOT A TRIAL THE JURY

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:22.087
TRIAL BECAUSE OF A MANDATORY

02:14:22.154 --> 02:14:23.789
CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE

02:14:23.855 --> 02:14:25.390
IN BRENTWOOD SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:27.359

WHAT HELP TO IT. MY HUSBAND AND

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:31.730
I FIND THAT AGREEMENT BELIEVING

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:33.365
THAT MOST ARBITRATION WOULD

02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:34.833
COVER GRIEVANCES WE MIGHT HAVE

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.368
WITH THE SCHOOL REGARDING OUR

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:38.403
TRIAL EDUCATION. WE NEVER

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.571
ENVISIONED IT WOULD COVER A

02:14:39.638 --> 02:14:40.972
FELONY CRIME AND WE CERTAINLY

02:14:41.039 --> 02:14:42.407
NEVER ENVISIONED THAT WE WERE

02:14:42.474 --> 02:14:43.475
SIGNING AWAY ARE TWELFTH RIGHT

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:44.910
TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATH TO

JUSTICE. NO PARENT DOES OR

02:14:47.112 --> 02:14:49.614
SHOULD. THE CONTENT THE PARENT

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:50.916
TO FIND YOU THE PREMIUM IS THAT

02:14:50.982 --> 02:14:52.284
ARBITRATION IS INTENDED TO

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.752
RESOLVE DISPUTES RELATED TO

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:57.656
ATTENDING A SCHOOL LIKE THIS

02:14:57.722 --> 02:14:58.256
AGREEMENT ABOUT A GREAT ORANGE

02:14:58.323 --> 02:14:59.224
ON. ARBITRATION CERTAINLY HAS

02:14:59.291 --> 02:15:00.859
PLACE TO DOUBLE CHECK SYSTEM

02:15:00.926 --> 02:15:01.793
BUT WAIT FIFTEEN SHOULD HAVE

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.428
THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ARBITRATION

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:05.230

SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD AT THE

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.701
POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE ANY

02:15:09.768 --> 02:15:11.169
CHANCE OF TRUE TRANSPARENCY AND

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:13.238

THE SEXUAL FALL VICTIM BUT ALSO

02:15:20.645 --> 02:15:22.681
FOR SOCIETY. IT INSULATES THE

INVITATION FROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY

INCIDENTS OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE

02:22:18.696 --> 02:22:20.331
COMMITTED THESE TYPES OF ACTS

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:21.499
