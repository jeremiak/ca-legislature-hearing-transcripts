00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.406
TODAY WILL FOCUS MOSTLY ON THE

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.876
RESPONSE EFFORT- AND SOME OF

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.544
THE DETAILS THERE WE REALIZE

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.478
THAT THERE'S STILL AN ACTIVE

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.213
ONGOING INVESTIGATION UNDER WAY

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.183
AND SO WE MAY NOT GET EVERY

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:57.784
ANSWER WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.152
TODAY BUT- I THINK THE MAIN

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:01.220
MESSAGE OUGHT TO BE THAT. IF T.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:03.656
AS LONG AS THE- HEROES LONG AS

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:05.358
THE CLEANUP IS STILL GOING

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:06.425
WE'RE GOING TO BE DIGGING INTO

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.161
THAT. BUT EVEN WHEN IT'S

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.663
COMPLETE THE WORK IS NOT DONE-

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.499
SO I WANTED. TO PASS THE

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.667

FINEST BEACHES IN THE COUNTRY-

SO AMAZING BEAUTIFUL- PRESERVES

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.696
COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:46.299
PROTECT. MANY SPECIES INCLUDING

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.267
ENDANGERED SPECIES OF BIRDS AND

ARE IMPORTANT- IN TWO HERE ON

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.343
OCTOBER SECOND THAT THIS WAS

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.011
ALL BEING ENDANGERED BY A

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.547
MASSIVE OIL SPILL I WAS WAS

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:03.449
DISCONCERTING TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:04.984
NOW I FIRST AND FOREMOST WANNA

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:07.453
TANK UNIFIED COMMAND THE U. S.

AFICIONADOS AND I KNOW WE HAVE

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.992

TODAY OFFER THEY'RE QUICK AND

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.864
DECISIVE RESPONSE WHICH I THINK

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.865
REALLY PREVENTED THIS FROM

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.299
BEING MUCH WORSE THAN IT COULD

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.435
HAVE BEEN I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:24.036
SHOUT OUT TO HUNTINGTON BEACH

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.339
AND ORANGE COUNTY- WHO ALSO

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.540
QUICKLY DEPLOYED A LOT OF

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:29.475
BLOOMS A LOT OF PERSONNEL. AND

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.977
I KNOW IT THAT PROTECTED US

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:31.978
SOME OF OUR ECOLOGICAL

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.913
PRESERVES- PLACES LIKE BOLSA

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.649
CHICA- THE WETLANDS THAT- COULD

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.851
HAVE REALLY BEEN SUFFERED FROM

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:39.485
MUCH MORE DEVASTATION THAN THEY

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.354
DID- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.189
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ENDED UP

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.391
WITH A FAR SMALLER OIL SPILL

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.126
THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.327
THAT WAS CONTAINED MUCH MORE

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.496
THAN THAN WE- I THINK EVEN OUR

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:53.132
BEST- BUT MOST OPTIMISTIC OUT

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.468
EXPECTATIONS WERE- WE STILL

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:56.435
CLOSED ON OUR BEACHES FOR

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.703
NEARLY TWO WEEKS WE'RE STILL

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.938
GOING TO CLEAN THIS UP FOR

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.140
WEEKS AND WEEKS. AT SOME POINT

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:03.209
WE HAVE TO ASK IS OFFSHORE

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.244
DRILLING WORTH IT- THE RISKS

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.046
THAT SEEM OMNIPRESENT THAT

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:09.015
JEOPARDIZE A COASTAL ECONOMY

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.083
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.686
WORTH APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:14.320
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BY SOME

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.290
ESTIMATES- A COASTAL- BECAUSE A

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:19.091
COASTLINE THAT NOT ONLY

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:20.626
GENERATES SO MUCH REVENUE FOR

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.994
US BUT IS PART OF WHO WE ARE AS

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:26.599
CALIFORNIANS. WHEN WE THINK

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.833
ABOUT CALIFORNIA M. PEOPLE FROM

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.501
AROUND WORLD THINK CAL THEY

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.070
THINK ABOUT. OUR BEACHES ARE CO-

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:32.405
WE ARE KNOWN FOR THAT. IT'S

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:34.006
PART OF WHO WE ARE WITH YOUR

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.808
SERVER FOR. MY KIDS GO BOOGIE

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.476
BOARDING EVERY OTHER WEEKEND OR

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:39.078
JUST WALKING ON THE COASTLINE

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:41.113
AND ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS. THIS

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.282
IS A PART OF WHO WE ARE AND THE

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.351
OIL THAT IS GENERATED- THAT IS

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.919
EXTRACTED EACH YEAR OFF OF

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.154
CALIFORNIA WATERS WHETHER IN

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.722
FEDERAL OR STATE WATERS.

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:50.990
ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ZERO

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.492
POINT 3% OF OIL PRODUCTION

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.329
ANNUALLY. IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:57.730
THAT'S NOT EVEN A DROP IN THE

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:58.998
BUCKET AND YET WE CONTINUALLY

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:02.501
FACE THIS THREAT OF OIL SPILLS.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.303
AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AGING.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.505
AS IT JUST SEEMS INEVITABLE IN

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.573
AND AS THEY SAY WHERE THERE'S

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.741
DRILLING THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:09.976

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.849

AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.088
THERE IS AN ONGOING

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:24.556
INVESTIGATION LOOKING INTO

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:26.625
THIS- BUT- PRELIMINARY

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.260
REPORTING LINKS THE CAUSE TO A

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.995
BOAT ANCHOR. WHICH IS OUT OF

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.664
THE OIL COMPANIES CONTROL SO

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.198
IT'S GOING TO BE I LIKE TO SEE

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.167
HOW THAT IS GONNA BE MITIGATED

00:15:35.234 --> 00:15:38.837
IN THE FUTURE. AND WHAT

CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE THAT'S

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.977
CAUSING THIS BACK UP. OF ALL

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.111
THESE CONTAINER SHIPS OFF THE

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:48.580
COAST THERE WE GO. BECAUSE YOU

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:50.182

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.151
IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I DON'T

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:52.851
KNOW IF THAT WILL COME UP IN

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:54.553
TODAY'S HEARING BUT I THINK

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.256
IT'S IMPORTANT ON US. AS THIS

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.124
NATURISTS WAS CAN YOU LOOK INTO

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.192
THAT BECAUSE WHILE THOSE SHIPS

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.328
OR- OFFSHORE THEY'RE BURNING

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:04.663
OIL. BURNING DIESEL TO KEEP

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.333
THEIR LIGHTS ON KEEP THE MOTORS

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:08.667
RUNNING. AND YOU KNOW.

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.369
CALIFORNIA'S A LOT OF WORK IN

THE SHIP'S WHEN THEY'RE IN PORT

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.343

WHITE WHY IS THE PARTS BACKED

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.847

HAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY IN THE

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.918
MATTER. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.086
FOR US NOT TO PUSH ALL THE

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.121

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:12.270
ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECONOMY.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.907
WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS ABOUT FOUR

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:18.110
AND A HALF MILES OFF SHORE SO

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.245
IN FEDERAL WATERS. THERE IS A

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:24.616
PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM ONE

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:26.551
PLATFORM WHICH IS A COLLECTION

00:21:26.618 --> 00:21:29.121
OF THREE PLATFORMS OPERATED BY

00:21:29.187 --> 00:21:30.889
A COMPANY CALLED BETA OFFSHORE

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.557
OWNED BY A COMPANY CALLED

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:36.261
AMPLIFY ENERGY. THAT LAST

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:39.431
PLATFORM ELLIE. AS A PIPELINE

00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:42.300
WHICH DELIVERS THE PRODUCT.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:43.802
SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN MILES

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:46.338
INLAND.WHERE THE PIPE COMES ON

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.306
SHORE JUST BELOW THE QUEEN MARY

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:51.043
MORE LESS. TO LAND BASED

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:54.413
INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAD A RUPTURE

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:58.083
IN IT AND WE NOW KNOW. BASED ON

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.352
VISUAL AND DIVER AND OTHER

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:03.321
EVIDENTIARY EFFORTS BUT ABOUT

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.156
FOUR THOUSAND FEET OF THAT

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:07.959
PIPELINE WAS MOVED ABOUT A

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:08.493
HUNDRED AND FIVE FEET ALSO

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.797
CENTER. AND IN THAT STRETCH IS

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:13.331
ABOUT A THIRTEEN INCH

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:15.067
HORIZONTAL ALMOST LIKE A

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.968
HAIRLINE FRACTURE IF YOU COULD

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.670
IMAGINE A BROWN BREAK. IN A

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:21.273
PIPE WHICH IS I THINK ABOUT

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.374
THIRTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.042
CONCRETE ON THE OUTSIDE METAL

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:26.578
ON THE INSIDE. THAT'S THE

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:30.148
LIKELY SOURCE OF THE LEAK. FROM

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:33.051
THE VERY BEGINNING MOMENTS ALL

NATURE FROM A LESS OF A PRODUCT

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.770
ASPECT WE COULD PICK UP ON THE

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:49.140
WATER TO DEALING WITH TAR BALLS

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:21.106
ITERATE AND DEPLOY FORCES TO

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:23.441
DEAL WITH IT. WE CREATED A

00:27:23.508 --> 00:27:26.444
SEPARATE INVESTIGATORY EFFORT

GRAPPLING WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT

SENATOR- WE'VE ALREADY STARTED

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:46.643
THE UNIFIED COMMAND MATT AND

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.145
WHILE THEY WERE STILL MOBILIZED%

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.346
OCEAN COAST COLLEGE TO START

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.615
GATHERING YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.883
THOSE ITEMS I MENTIONED. FOR

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.551
THE REFUGIO SPILL IT TOOK US

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:55.719
ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS YEAH WE

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:56.887
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:59.823
IMPORTANCE OF THIS TASK. AND-

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.357
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A TOP

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:03.594
PRIORITY. IF I COULD I'D ALSO

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.563
JUST SAY. PART OF WHAT WE

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.031
EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM IN

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:11.301
REFUGIO IS. AS WE THINK THROUGH

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:14.238
OUR ASSESSMENTS SICK THE

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:16.673
FEEDBACK OF OTHERS INVOLVED SO

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.307
I DO THINK PART OF THIS DYNAMIC

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:19.376
WOULD BE. HOW DO WE GET

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:21.345
FEEDBACK FROM OUR CONSERVATION

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:23.480
ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE KIND OF

00:46:23.547 --> 00:46:25.516
BROADLY INVOLVED WHAT WOULD IT

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:28.218
LOOK LIKE TO GET FEEDBACK YOU

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.820
KNOW FROM OUR LOCAL CITIES.

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.288
MAKING SURE WE HAVE THOSE AND

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:33.824
PUT BLINDS FOR THE FEEDBACK AND

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:34.358
ASSESSMENT I THINK WILL BE

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:36.560
REALLY VALUABLE. EXCELL AWFULLY

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.530
TODAY STARTS THAT PROCESS IN A

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:41.565
MORE FORMAL CONTEXT BUT- AND

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.567
THAT'LL CONTINUE- MY OTHER

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:48.038
QUESTIONS- THE- TO DO WITH THE

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:49.072
ISSUES THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:50.807
FULLY EVALUATED YET BUT IN

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:53.110
TERMS OF- WHAT WE COULD HAVE

00:46:53.177 --> 00:46:56.647
DONE BETTER- I WANTED TO JUST

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:58.916
GET YOUR INITIAL TAKE ON- THE

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:01.618
ACTUAL- THE ACTUAL DETECTION

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:03.620
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING OUT

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:06.857
THERE- WHEN I WENT OUT WE WERE-

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.892
LOSING SOME CAMERAS AND THE C.

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:09.927
THIRTY SEVENS THAT WERE MOVING

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:12.296
AROUND WITH COAST GUARD. BUT MY

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.497
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:16.400
NO SURFACE SEARCH RADAR-

00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:19.036
CURRENTLY BEING DEPLOYED- THAT

00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:20.304
WE'RE NOT UTILIZING ANY

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:21.838
AUTOMATED WATER QUALITY SENSING

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:24.541
LOUISE OR OTHER TECHNIQUES IN

00:47:24.608 --> 00:47:26.910
OUR DETECTION PROCESS- HAVE

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:30.247
YOU. HAVE YOU- AND ANY COMMENTS

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:34.618
ON ON THOSE ISSUES WHETHER- BUT

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.320
COULD HAVE BEEN- EITHER MORE

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:38.822
MORE TIMELY IN OUR RESPONSE OR

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.357
OR IF THOSE ARE SORT OF

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:41.191
OUTSTANDING ITEMS THE

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.426
DEPARTMENT STILL LOOKING TO

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.761
OBTAIN OR OR NOT NECESSARY FOR

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.897
SOME REASON. A COMBINATION AND

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:51.668
THEN ALAS MR CALLING TO FILL IN

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.470
ANY BLANKS FIRST. IT'S TOTALLY

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.939
UNDERSTANDABLE AND WE CAN

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.710
ALWAYS TIGHTEN UP THOSE FIRST

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:00.244
TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY TWO

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.145
HOURS AND THESE DYNAMICS. SADLY

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.714
I'VE LIVED THROUGH TWO AT A

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.683
PRETTY. IMPACTFUL SIGNIFICANCE

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.219
LEVEL AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:11.321
THAT'S HAPPENING FOR US IN THE

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:14.057
OPENING MOMENTS IS. TRYING TO

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:17.194
CONFIRM WHAT'S GOING ON DEALING

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:19.396
WITH MANY MANY AND THAT

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:23.800
INFORMATION AND PUTS. AND THEN

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.636
BEING STABLE ENOUGH ON

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.937
INFORMATION TO KNOW WHERE TO

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:29.740
DEPLOY. OF COURSE YOU DON'T

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.742
WANT TO SEARCH A THOUSAND

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:33.644
PEOPLE TO THE WRONG PLACE. SO I

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.812
THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:38.248
WILL EVENTUALLY DISCOVER WAS

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:40.617
PLAYING OUT THROUGH THE EARLY

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:42.886
MORNING OF SATURDAY OCTOBER

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:46.189
SECOND. OUR WARDENS ACTUALLY

00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:48.692
WORK OUT THERE ALL FORWARD ON

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.194
THAT SATURDAY WE HAD FOLKS ON

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:53.497
THE WATER ANYWAY RELATIVE TO

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:56.266
THE LOBSTER OPENER. AND IN THE

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:58.335
DARK WERE YOU KNOW WORKING AS

00:48:58.402 --> 00:48:58.835
ONE OF THOSE INFORMATION

00:48:58.902 --> 00:49:01.038
CHANNELS. SECOND COMMENT

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:06.677
SENATOR. I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.512
COMMENT ABOUT WHAT KIND OF

00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:11.181
DETECTION TECHNOLOGY I DO THINK

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:13.083
WE SHOULD KEEP OUR MIND OPEN

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.951
AND PUSH OURSELVES TO IMPROVE

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:18.121
IN THAT AREA REMINDER THE

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:22.359
FEDERAL WATERS PRETTY FAR OUT

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:25.595
AS TO THE PLATFORM ITSELF. AND

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:28.598
I AM NOT AWARE OF EXISTING

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.300
WATER BILL YOU DYNAMIC OUT

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:31.835
THERE THAT MAY BE COLLECTING

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.938
WATER QUALITY FIRST FOR EXAMPLE

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:37.341
PERHAPS OVER TIME THAT NETWORK

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:40.243
COULD BECOME THAT AUTOMATED AND

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.846
THAT FINE TUNED. AND THIS IS

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.414
WHERE MR CULLEN MAY HAVE

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.083
SOMETHING TO OFFER EACH YEAR

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.785
PART OF US FIRST CHARGE IS TO

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:52.489
BE CONVENING INDUSTRY AND THE

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.224
EXPERTS IN THE SCIENTISTS TO

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:56.560
PURPOSEFULLY ASK WHAT IS THE

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.261
NEXT VERSION OF TECHNOLOGY. I

00:49:58.328 --> 00:49:59.796
DO THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:01.631
INTO WHAT CANBE HAPPENING

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.233
OVERNIGHT WHAT COULD BE

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.901
HAPPENING IN THE DARK THERE'S A

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.503
LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.672
THIS PROFESSIONAL SPACE HOW

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.407
MUCH YOU CAN BE DOING IN THE

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.842
DARK BUT THAT SEEMS TO ME AN

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:14.144
OBVIOUS ARENA TO THINK ABOUT AS

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:17.214
THE TECHNOLOGY. ADMINISTRATOR

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.914
CALLING YOU WANNA. THE

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:20.217
TECHNOLOGY. YOUR SOUL OUR OUR

STREET STAND ACT MANDATES SAY-

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:27.424
THAT WE BEST TRIPLE

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:29.526
TECHNOLOGIES SPILLS AND SO WITH

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.428
THAT IN MIND EVERY TWO YEARS

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.330
SINCE THIS PAST FEBRUARY WE CO

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.432
HOST OIL SPILL TECHNOLOGY

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.801
WORKSHOP THIS PAST ONE HELD

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:38.835
VIRTUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.904
FOUR DAYS HAD SEVENTY ONE

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.606
COUNTRIES REPRESENTED WITH MORE

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:43.507
THAN THREE HUNDRED

TO- VARIOUS BOOMING INTO

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.250
CONTAINMENT TECHNIQUES AND SO

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:57.387
FORTH SO. SPECIFIC TO THIS BILL-

00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:59.389
LOOKING BACK AT MY PREVIOUS

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.124
CAREER IN THE COAST GUARD- I

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.726
FLEW MANY MISSIONS WITH

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:04.161
SOMETHING CALLED A SIDE LOOKING

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:05.796
AIRBORNE RADAR WHICH WAS A

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.831
SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR WHICH

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:11.034
WAS VERY. CAPABLE OF DETECTING

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:14.104
VARIATIONS AND WATER DAMPENING

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:15.205
SOMEONE OIL SLICKS ON THE

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:17.007
SURFACE OF THE WATER IT MAKES

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.675
IT A LITTLE BIT FLATTER AND THE

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:21.978
RADAR CAN DETECT THAT. THAT WAS

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.947
EMPLOYED EARLY ON IN THIS BILL

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.515
IT WAS ABLE TO SEE- SEE SOME

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.583
THE BOUNDARIES OF THE HEAVIER

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.187
OIL IT'S INEFFECTIVE FORESEEN-

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.922
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF AND PERHAPS

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.256
THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.958
DEVELOPED AS ANY SHORE BASED

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:37.360
RADAR THE COMPULSORY. IN DETECT

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.362
OIL. ON OUR PARTNER STARTED

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:44.468
DESCRIPTIONS TO IN A LAWYER. ON

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.635
THERE IS A- ARTIFACT CALLED THE

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:48.038
SOUTHERN- CALIFORNIA

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:50.407
OBSERVATION- SENSING SYSTEM

00:51:50.474 --> 00:51:52.509
SCREWS. THEY HAVE SOME CALL THE

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:54.177
HF RADAR WHICH IS VERY

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:55.912
EFFECTIVE AND WE USED IT DURING

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:58.582
THE SPELL AND REFUGIO. TO SEND

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:01.117
A PULSE OUT AND HELP BETTER

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:02.786
PROTECT TRAJECTORIES OF

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:03.854
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE OUT

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.256
THERE ALSO WHAT WATER CURRENCY

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:08.992
IN SURFACE WINDS- BUT THIS IS A

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.994
PRIORITY FOR US OUR CENTER TO

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:12.863
CONTINUE TO GO AND LOOK AT

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:15.065
TECHNOLOGIES THAT. CAN DETECT

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:17.234
OIL ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. SIR I

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.703
THINK WE HAVE A GREAT YOU KNOW-

00:52:19.769 --> 00:52:21.538
WE'RE KEEPING OUR LIST OF OTHER

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:23.273
THINGS WHERE WE WANT TO TAKE A

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.375
LOOK AT DOING BETTER I THINK AS

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:27.878
EXAMPLES. INSTEAD OF IT IN THE

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.980
EVENT TRAINING VOLUNTEERS IS

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.214
THERE A WAY TO CULTIVATE

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.450
VOLUNTEERS LIKE ANNUALLY SO

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:34.718
MORE PEOPLE ARE UP TO DATE ON

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:37.554
TRAINING. AS AN EXAMPLE I THINK

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:39.189
A PLACE WE CAN BE DOING BETTER

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.591
IS. INSTEAD OF HAVING THE

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:43.793
EVENTS AND THEN BEING ENGAGED

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:44.828
WITH A LOT OF EXTERNAL

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.830
SCIENTISTS. AT ALL THESE

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.365
LEADING INSTITUTIONS WHAT IF

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:51.768
WE'RE DOING THAT MORE REGULARLY.

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:52.769
THEY WAS THE FIRST I'M A OF

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.538
WHAT WE KILL ME PUBLIC HEALTH

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.039
INTO THE COMMAND I THOUGHT THAT

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:58.575
WAS OUTSTANDING. AT A STRATEGIC

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.410
LEVEL BUT MY GUESS IS WE'RE

00:53:00.477 --> 00:53:02.112
GONNA NEED TO. PRACTICE THAT

00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:04.147
WAS COUNTIES ALONG THE COAST TO

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:06.716
BE TACTICALLY. MORE ADEPT IN

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.418
RAPID IN BRINGING AND THEN THAT

00:53:08.485 --> 00:53:11.121
WAY. AS OTHER EXAMPLES OF

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.789
IMPROVEMENTS. I'D LIKE TO BUILD

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:13.957
ON YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:15.892
VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE A MODEL

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.161
ALREADY IN PLACE WITH THE OIL

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:18.728
WHILE IT'S KERR NETWORK THEY

00:53:18.795 --> 00:53:21.631
HAVE THE- A QUITE A NETWORK OF

THROUGH RECURRING TRAINING.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.804
OUGHT TO PREPARE THEM TO GO OUT

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.306
AND PERFORM THEIR WILDLIFE

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:31.207
MISSION SO WE CAN TAKE THAT.

THEM THAT RECURRING TRAINING SO

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.449
THAT THEY'RE BETTER PREPARED

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:39.950
AND POISED TO SURGE WHEN

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:42.552
SOMETHING HAPPENS. THANKS FOR

REFUGIO JUST WITNESSING IT IN

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.797
ACTION THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.833
HOW GOVERNMENT. CAN WORK

00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:32.135
EFFECTIVELY IN RESPONDING TO

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:33.570
CRISES IN AND WAS VERY

CRITICAL IN PREVENTING US FROM

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:49.352
BECOMING A LARGER PROBLEM IN

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:51.521
ORANGE COUNTY- I SHOULD ALSO

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.323

TRAINING. I REMEMBER TALKING

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:58.094
WITH THE PROPRIETOR OF THE

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.362
HUNTINGTON BEACH WETLANDS WHEN

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.498
WE WENT TO VISIT AND TODAY HAD

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:03.433
SAID THAT- ABOUT NINE MONTHS

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.334
EARLIER THAN ACTUALLY HAD A

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:05.635
TRAINING EXERCISE ON THE

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.836
REASONS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.772
BOOMS DEPLOYED SO QUICKLY IS

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:09.739
BECAUSE THEY JUST ON THE

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.608
TRAINING EXERCISES. WHEN THE

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:13.309
BLOOMS ARRIVED THEY WERE- YOU

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.511
THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:15.445
WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS FRESH

00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:16.613
IN THEIR MIND I THINK THAT'S A

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.848
VERY- IMPORTANT ANOTHER GOOD

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.517
EXAMPLE OF HOW WE LEARN FROM

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.752
THE FUTURE- I HAD A COUPLE

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.287
QUESTIONS THOUGH ON TOP OF

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:28.525
THAT- I GUESS FOLLOWING ON-

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.026
CENTER STERN'S QUESTION EARLY

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:33.363
DETECTION- YOU KNOW WE'VE READ

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.964
AND THIS IS ALSO THE SOME OF

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:35.665
THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.300
RECEIVED TODAY THAT. THERE ARE

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.769
NUMBER OF FAILURES OF-

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.204
REGULATION THAT THAT WE'VE

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.439
TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONG TIME

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:45.508
THAT- FEDERATIONS HAVE NOT KEPT

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:48.311
UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WEIRD

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.346
AT EITHER END BOTH AT THIS SORT

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:52.115
OF- GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL BUT ALSO

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.283
AT THE PROPRIETOR OF THAT IS TO

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.652
SAY THAT THE OIL. DRILLING AND

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.754
EXTRACTION OPERATORS THEMSELVES

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.389
HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE TYPES

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:01.124
OF MONITORING THAT MIGHT BE

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.826
HELPFUL IN DETECTING ALWAYS

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:05.028
SPELLS EARLIER ON AND THERE

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:05.628
HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THIS

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:08.031
PARTICULAR OUR OIL SPILL COULD

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:08.932
HAVE BEEN DETECTED MUCH

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:15.138
EARLIER- PERHAPS NOT JUST AT

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:15.772
THE ONSET OF THIS PRETTY. GOOD

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:16.339
SPELL BUT THAT. THE PROBLEMS

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.742
THE PIPE. MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONTH-EARLIER IF THEY HAD BETTER.

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.877
MIND SO. AND I GUESS I WAS

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.480
WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO.

00:56:23.546 --> 00:56:25.682
WHAT TYPES OF REGULATIONS

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.416
WHETHER FEDERAL STATE WE CAN

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:28.384
TALK ABOUT THAT LATER MIGHT

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:30.386
HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN.

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:31.855
PREVENTING THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.990
SPELL FROM HAPPENING. SO

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.727
SENATOR. A COUPLE THOUGHTS HERE

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:40.864
FIRST- I'M GONNA SAY UP FRONT I

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.766
THINK MY ANSWER TO YOU WILL NOT

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.735
BE AS FULLY RESPONSIVE AS YOU

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:48.171
WANT AND THERE'S A REASON.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:51.407
PRIMARILY THE LIKELY SOURCE FOR

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:54.744
THE LEAK IS IN FEDERAL WATERS.

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.213
FOR IF A PIPELINE WITH

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.382
PRIMARILY FEDERAL JURISDICTION.

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.083
AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.818
TALKED ABOUT IT THIS IS THE

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.653
PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.156
MATERIALS SAFETY AGENCY WITHIN

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.791
THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:08.391
TRANSPORTATION AT THE FEDERAL

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.294
LEVEL. THEY ARE INVOLVED IN

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:12.262
THAT INVESTIGATION THAT'S

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:15.598
OCCURRING. THERE'S A FEDERAL A

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:17.433
CORRECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.103
DEBATE OFF SHORE WE HAD A VERY

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.072
DETAILED APPROACH OF THE WORK

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.808
THAT HAS TO BE DONE. NO

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.209
RESTARTED THAT EFFECTIVE

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.777
PIPELINE MATT KERR IN LAST

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.779
UNTIL THE WHOLE SUITE OF

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.614
CONDITIONS PRECEDING DOORMAT

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.650
UNDER THAT FEDERAL WATER.

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.885
SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'VE GOT THE

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.887
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.589
BOARD INVOLVED WE'VE GOT

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:40.757
SOMETHING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.192
THE INTERIOR WHICH IS THE

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:44.027
BUREAU OF SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.361
ENFORCEMENT WHICH HAS

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:48.631
JURISDICTION EFFECTIVELY OVER

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:49.098
THE PLATFORMS AND THAT

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:51.201
INFRASTRUCTURE. BY WARDENS ARE

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:53.770
IN THAT SPACE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:57:53.837 --> 00:57:55.705
AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE

00:57:55.772 --> 00:57:56.773
CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.974
UNDERSTANDING THE COLLECTION OF

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.109
EVIDENCE FOR OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:02.545
NEEDS POTENTIALLY. I REALLY

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:04.681
CAN'T COMMENT ON THE DYNAMICS

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:07.083
AROUND THE PIPE ITSELF. I WILL

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.285
ALSO JUST BLUNTLY SAY TO YOU I

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:12.789
REALIZED- WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:15.258
WHO ACTIVATED WHAT REQUIRED

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.994
DISCLOSURE WHEN. IS OF EXTREME

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:20.363
IMPORTANCE AS WELL. BUT IT IS

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.132
CONNECTED TO THAT. EVIDENTIARY

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.767
AN INVESTIGATORY DYNAMIC AND I

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.236
JUST CAN'T COMMENT I MEAN I

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:27.770
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I KNOW IT'S

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:30.473
NON RESPONSIVE- IN THE SENSE OF

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.108
WHY YOU'RE ENQUIRING MAYBE I

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:33.343
DIDN'T ARTICULATE THE QUESTION

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:34.878
WELL ENOUGH I'M NOT TRYING

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:36.713
INTERESTED AT THIS MOMENT IN IN

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.848
THE WHO WHAT WHY WHEN. I'M MORE

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:40.884
THINKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALLY-

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.752
ARE THERE REGULATORY CHANGES

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.320
AND RECOGNIZING THAT A LOT OF

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:45.421
THIS IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.223
HAVE BEEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL-

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.691
BUT WHAT REGULATORY CHANGES

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.293
MIGHT HAVE HELPED WITH A SPELL

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.161
OF THIS TYPE- GOING FORWARD IN

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:53.363
OTHER WORDS WHAT CAN WE DO TO

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:55.732
TRY TO PREVENT- AND PERHAPS

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:57.500

IMPLEMENT- WHAT CHANGES CAN WE

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:05.141
AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THIS

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.442
GENETICALLY BETWEEN THE FEDERAL

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.944
AND STATE GOVERNMENTS- WHAT

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.279

PROJECT FORWARD AND JUST OFFER

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.351
MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION I THINK

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:17.620
AUTOMATION. IS A CORE VALUE

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.689
CORE STRATEGY TO THE EXTENT

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:25.395
WHERE NOT WE SHOULD BE. AND

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:25.962
WHERE WE ARE BUT COULD DO IT

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.863
BETTER. I THINK. I ENDED

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:30.767
DAUGHTER. PERSISTENT INSPECTION

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.935
AND AGAIN I'M NOT COMMENTING

00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:33.469
LOOKING BACKWARDS ON THIS ON

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.270
WHETHER EITHER OF THOSE

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:36.673
VARIABLES FOR A PLAY BUT GOING

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.775

AROUND BOTH THOSE DYNAMICS ARE

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.815
THREE KEY VARIABLES AUTOMATION

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.811
QUESTION REVOLVES AROUND- NOT

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.279
THE TIMING OF THE SPILL BUT THE

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.914
TIMING OF NOTIFICATION TO LOCAL

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.583
JURISDICTIONS AND CITIES AND

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.418
COUNTIES- I WAS TALKING WITH

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.120
MAYOR KIM CARR EARLIER THIS

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.188
WEEK AND I DON'T WANT TO. GIVE

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.324

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:02.725
YOU KNOW SINCE SHE'S GONNA BE

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.927
SPEAKING LATER I JUST I JUST

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.932
WERE VERY FORTUITOUS AND I CAN

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:10.933
LET HER DESCRIBE THE EXACT

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.535
CIRCUMSTANCES LATER IN FINDING

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:13.669
ABOUT THAT OUT ABOUT THIS BILL

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:16.139
AS EARLY AS THEY DID- EVEN THAT

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.340
THAT BEINGSAID THEY THEY FELT

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:18.474
LIKE THEY COULD HAVE ACTUALLY

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.076
GOTTEN NOTICE MANY HOURS

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.311
EARLIER- THAT THE U. S. COAST

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:23.780
GUARD. HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.248
EARLIER THAN WAS COMMUNICATED

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:28.084
HUNTINGTON BEACH- THEY ALSO SHE

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.485
ALSO EXPRESSED TO ME THAT. THEY

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.454
HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT BECAUSE

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.323
THEY HAD HAD A CARGO ACCIDENT A

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.925
CARGO SHIP ACCIDENT ACCIDENT

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.860
OFF THE COAST OF HUNTING BEACH-

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:38.861
LIKE MAYBE NINE MONTHS EARLIER

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.396
AND SO THEY- IN RESPONSE TO

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.464
THAT HAD GOTTEN A LOT OF

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.598
EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:45.134
IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THIS SO- H.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.602
B. WAS WAS PARTICULARLY WELL

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.204
PREPARED WHAT WAS- I GUESS

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.672
NOTICED EARLIER THAN MIGHT HAVE

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.808
BEEN THE CASE OTHERWISE BUT- IT

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:52.608
THINKING ABOUT THIS GOING

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:53.876
FORWARD WOULD IT MAKE MORE

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.711
SENSE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A-

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.548
FORMAL NOTIFICATION PROCESS. SO

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.649
THAT AS SOON AS THE U. S. COAST

01:01:59.715 --> 01:02:01.417
GUARD FINDS OUT ABOUT SOMETHING

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:01.884
LIKE THIS THAT THEY'RE

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.619
COMMUNICATING IT TO- THE

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:05.455
AFFECTED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.623
AND AS WELL AS A COUNTY- SO

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.026
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.160
QUICKLY BECAUSE OURS OBVIOUSLY

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.895
MATTER IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THIS

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:13.663
AND THEN AS A SECONDARY

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:16.466
QUESTION. ARM WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.333
TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.135
REGIONAL SITES OR REGIONAL

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:20.770
COLLECTIVE STATE TO GATHER SOME

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:22.238
OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT MIGHT BE.

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:27.577
USEFUL IN RESPONSE. TO THESE

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:28.177
TYPES OF SPILLS OR EVENTS. I

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.946
ANSWERED YES AND YES. SO ON THE

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:33.182
ROAD NO. DINA ONE OF THE THINGS

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:36.285
I PERSONALLY WANNA. BE INVOLVED

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:40.289
IN AND UTILIZE THE ASSESSMENT

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.558
FOR. IS THAT WHICH MOMENTS WAS

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.394
NOTIFICATION GOING WHERE IN

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.563
WHAT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. AND

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:50.233
THEN BASED ON MY BETTER

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.701
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT ACROSS

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.703
THE SUITE OF INFORMATION CHAINS

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:56.038
ASK OURSELVES COLLECTIVELY AS

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.240
SHOULD WE ALL TAKE A LOOK AT

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.841
HOW NOTIFICATIONS HANDLED I

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:00.776
MEAN WE DO HAVE A NATIONAL

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:02.945
RESPONSE CENTER. BUT YOU KNOW

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:04.747
YOU'VE GOT COMMUNICATIONS GOING

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:07.016
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I THINK

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:09.819
IT'S APPROPRIATE- ASSESS

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:12.054
COLLECTIVELY IS THERE A SMARTER

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.357
WAY TO HANDLE OR IMPROVE UPON

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.691
NOTIFICATIONS EVERY HOUR DOES

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:19.095
MATTER. MY SECOND ANSWER YES ON

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.364
REGIONAL COLLECTIVES IS IN PART

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.566
BECAUSE IT KIND OF HAPPENS NOW

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.535
LAST FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR TO

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:28.604
WEIGH IN. ARE THE- CONTINGENCY

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.439
PLANS YOU SAW IN THE EARLIER

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.442
SLIDE IS THAT IDENTIFICATION IN

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.844
ADVANCE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.113
WETLANDS AND OTHER SITES. IN

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.615
THE PLACES WHERE LOCALIZED

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:41.250
EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY PRE

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.886
COLLECTED. HOWEVER I THINK WE

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:46.189
CAN LOOK AT THAT AGAIN AND ASK

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.090
YOU FOR PUTTING ENOUGH WEAPONS

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:50.493
IN THE RIGHT PLACES EARLY

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.929
ENOUGH BEFORE EVENTS. TIME YOU

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:53.563
WANT TO WEIGH IN ON EITHER OF

01:03:53.629 --> 01:03:56.966
THESE SHORT TRUCK AS WELL WELL

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.701
GO FIGURE LAST COMING AND THEN.

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.670
THE EARLIER ONE SO WITH A LOCAL

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:01.771
EQUIPMENT WE HAVE A GRANT

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:04.207
PROGRAM WHERE WE- AND THIS IS I

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:05.608
THINK CENTER WHAT YOU REFER TO

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.778
WIN SEATS ON EXERCISE OF

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.379
ROLLING OUT EQUIPMENT. THE END

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:13.382
AND EVALUATING IT SO WE PROVIDE

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.651
TRAILERS AND BOOM TO BOMB MANY

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:17.320
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:18.554
THE STATE AND WE CAN LOOK AT

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.256
ENHANCING THAT PROGRAM EVEN

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.458
MORE IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.327
THEY ARE OF COURSE REPOSITION

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:26.329
IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SOME

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.998
SOME SITES- AND DOG THING GOING

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:36.172

SURFACE WATERS AS BEST

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:44.981
SELECTIVITY AND ALSO ANOTHER

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.483
APP THAT YOU'RE ACTIVELY- I

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.851
NOTICED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL

HELICOPTERS DOING CIRCLES ALL

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.691
SORTS RIGHT NOW IDEA OF WHERE.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.293
THIS WAS HAPPENING BUT I WAS

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.196
ALSO TAKEN ABACK WITH HOW MANY

VESSELS WERE LINED UP CLOSE TO

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:03.399
THE SHORELINE AND I DIDN'T KNOW

TRANSPORT OF SOME THAT OIL- IN

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.615

VARIOUS ENTITIES WERE MADE

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.195

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:41.336
GOOD. IN THE TIME WE HAVE TO

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:43.572
REFLECT. THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:47.142
PROPOSALS ON THAT THAT WE COULD

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.642
WORK WITH THAT WOULD BE

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:50.045
HELPFUL. TO THE RESPONDING TEAM

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.947
THAT WE DO THAT AND I

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:54.482
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT IT MAKES

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:57.219
SENSE TO ME THAT EVEN IF THE-

01:20:57.285 --> 01:21:02.524
RESPONSIBLE PARTY IS- IT IS.

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.359
NOT REALLY EVENTUALLY AT FAULT

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:06.528
IN SOME WAY IT IT APPEARS TO

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.263
TAKE TO THE RESPONSE IF THAT'S

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.298
WHAT COMES OUT OF FRONT. AND SO

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.101
PLEASE OUR WORK WITH US IN A-

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:15.470
AND ONE THING TO MENTION- I

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.204
MEANT TO MENTION IN THE OPENING

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:19.174
STATEMENT- I DID A BILL WHEN I

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.109
WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.945
THERE WAS ORIGINALLY AN OIL

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:26.781
SPILL RESPONSE LEGISLATION. OF

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.984
THE FIRST 50% OF THE RESPONSE

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.086
WOULD BE PAID FOR JUST RIGHT

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:32.554
OUT OF THE POCKETS AND THEN THE

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.789
SECOND FIFTY PERCENT. WOULD BE

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.391
PAID FOR BY THE RESPONSIBLE

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.425
PARTY EVEN THOUGH THE

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.160
RESPONSIBLE PARTY MIGHT NOT

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.862
HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO THAT.

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:42.631
IN IT WAS POTENTIALLY HAMPERING

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:47.736
THE RESPONSE. TO BUILD THESE

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.170
WHERE THEY WERE BUT SAID THAT

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.705
THE STATE WOULD STEP UP AND NOT

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:52.941
LET ANY ARBITRAGE WILL BURY OR-

01:21:53.008 --> 01:21:56.311
DELAY OR IMPINGE THE RESPONSE.

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.213
OKAY AND I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:58.613
JUST BEEN A LOT OF

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.282
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE- THE

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.783
RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND HOW IT

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:03.785
FITS AND HOW IT ALL WORKS AND

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.654
ANIMAL WAS JUST IN THE ANSWER

BOX OR TIES TO THAT SO- AND I

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:09.758
UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.326
LEGISLATE EVERYTHING. BUT IT

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.261
WOULD BE NICE TO FACILITATE

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:15.196
ASSISTANCE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:16.531
IN THE MOMENT APPEARING TO ME

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.333
MAKING A DECISION THAT REFLECTS

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.335
ON SOMEBODY ELSE AND IF WE CAN

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:22.404
MAKE A DECISION THAT USES THAT.

THE AREA BUT NOTHING VERY

01:26:16.237 --> 01:26:18.306
SPECIFIC AT THAT TIME NO MAJOR

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.074

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:28.283
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. HOWEVER WE

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:29.951
DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.986
INFORMATION AS TO WHERE THE

01:26:32.053 --> 01:26:34.222
LOCATION OF THE- OF THE SPELL

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:36.324

THAT THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.870
TEAM WAS BEING ACTIVATED- BUT

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:51.639

EXACTLY WHERE THE SPELL WAS THE

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.679
SIZE OF IT- BUT WE KNEW THAT

01:26:57.745 --> 01:26:58.913

PROBABLY CLOSER TO A HUNDRED

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:12.760

IT WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:03.077
BETTER. AND SO AT THAT TIME AT

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.178
TWO O'CLOCK THE COAST GUARD HAD

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:06.381
ADVISED US THAT THE OIL SPILL

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:07.615

A HALF HOUR LATER. WE STARTED

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.673

SO BASICALLY FOR US WE I THINK

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:37.518
THAT THE TAKE AWAY FOR US AND

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.787

WE'VE HAD SOME TIME TO REFLECT

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.527
ON THIS WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:48.029
BETTER WHAT WHAT WOULD HAVE

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:51.232

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.367

NOTIFICATION CAME THROUGH WE

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:02.843
COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.979
PROACTIVE BECAUSE AS IT SAID IT

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:08.049

DECK EXPERIENCE- WELL IT WAS

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.636
REALLY CHAOTIC FOR THE PROBABLY

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.972
THE FIRST THIRTY SIX HOURS ONCE

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:32.840
EVERYBODY WAS MOBILIZED AND PUT

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.875
INTO PLACE. THE RESPONSE HAS

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:37.611
BEEN TREMENDOUS WE WENT FROM

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.513
HAVING MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.048
ON THE BEACH CLEANING OUR

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:42.850
SHORELINES AND THEN IT QUICKLY

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:45.553
JUMPED TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWO

01:33:45.619 --> 01:33:47.455
EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEN TO

FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SO WE SAW

01:33:49.223 --> 01:33:50.992
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WE WERE

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:53.327
ABLE TO RE OPEN OUR BEACHES

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:55.796
WITHIN EIGHT DAYS- FORTUNATELY

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:58.432
THE WATER WAS CLEAN WE WERE

01:33:58.499 --> 01:34:00.368
ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:02.503
OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD.

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.705
TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE- THE

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:06.140
ALSO SHE GOT LIKE A LOGICAL

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.175

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:11.612
MARSH DOES HAVE OIL DAMAGE- AND

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.347
AGAIN LOOKING BACK IF WE COULD

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:14.615
HAVE HAD MAYBE A FEW MORE HOURS

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:16.250
NOTICE WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:18.052
MITIGATED THAT DAMAGED EVEN

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.921
MORE THAN WHAT WE DID BUT- I AM

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:23.190
VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU IS

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.960

AT. ALL. OF THE ELEMENTS THAT

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:35.369
WENT INTO THE HE- A HOW WE

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:36.737
MAYBE BETTER BECAUSE- AS

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.206
SENATOR MENDEZ. OUT IT'S NAIVE

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:40.441

HAPPEN AGAIN- I HOPE IT DOESN'T

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:46.147
HAPPEN IN YOUR BACKYARD- IT IS

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.815
INCREDIBLY PAINFUL FOR OUR

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.284
COMMUNITY TO GO THROUGH THIS.

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.886
BUT THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:54.455
THAT I'VE SEEN MY RESIDENCE-

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:55.689

I LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE SALT

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.606

SAME. ARE DEVASTATING IMPACTS

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:36.303
THAT THAT ORANGE COUNTY GET-

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:38.072
BUT THERE ARE STILL ROCK

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:39.039
CONCERTS- THERE'S A REAL

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:47.581

THINK. YOU THOUGH WE NOT SEE AS-

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:56.390
IMPACT IN INSTEAD COUNTY. WE

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:58.125

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.927
OIL SPILL OFF FORCING LOCAL

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:00.928
GOVERNMENTS TO CONFRONT THE

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:03.030
REALITY OF POLLUTION IN OUR

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:03.931
BEACHES AND BAYS THAT SHOULD

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:05.933
NOT BE THERE- AND I THINK THIS

01:40:05.999 --> 01:40:08.769
IS A POWERFUL REMINDER OF. THE

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:09.770
REALITY THAT THE RISK IS NEVER

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:11.238
BEEN BURKE. THE REWARD FOR

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:15.342
OFFSHORE DRILLING- AND YOU KNOW

01:40:15.409 --> 01:40:16.410
TIME AND AGAIN WE SEE. AS LONG

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:17.478
AS OFF WE'RE DOING THIS ALL OUT

01:40:17.544 --> 01:40:19.046
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE.

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:20.347
ALL THESE TYPES OF WEEKS THESE

01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:22.182
TYPE OF ACCIDENTS YOU START.

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.618
ACTS ARE ARE BORING LIFE. OUR

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.086
FISHERIES ON OUR ECONOMY ON OUR

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:28.021
BEACHES AND BAYS- AND I KNOW

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:28.889
THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:33.260
MECHANISM FOR REIMBURSEMENT AS.

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:33.861
IT RELATES TO THE FUNCTION OF

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:34.461
THIS. BUT I'D BE HARD PRESSED

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:36.096
TO SHOW YOU EVER- ECOLOGICAL

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:38.165
DISASTER READY ACTUAL PROPERTY

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:40.000
INTO T. TRULY PAID FOR THE FULL

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.902
COST OF THE RECOVERY. ARE WE

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:43.337
HAVE THIS ONGOING TENDENCY TO

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.572
PRIVATIZE PROFIT AND

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:47.374
SOCIALIZED. THE COSTS.

01:40:47.441 --> 01:40:49.576
ASSOCIATED WITH WITH ON THAT

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:50.477
PROFIT GENERATING ENTERPRISE

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:53.280
GOES WRONG. AND SO YOU KNOW AS

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:54.848
WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I'M

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:55.749
HOPING THIS DOESN'T BECOME

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:57.217
ANOTHER ANGLE ON WHAT JUST

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:59.386
YOUNG. DEEPWATER HORIZON EXXON

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.121
VALDEZ ON AND ON AND ON WITH

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.856
THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED. ARE

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:04.491
NOT PROPERLY COMPENSATED TAKE

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:05.559
ACCOUNT AND THE PROFIT

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:06.927
GENERATED YOU GET OUR PRICE

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:08.462
GOES ON TO CONTINUE TO REAP.

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:10.631
TREMENDOUS PROFITS AT THE

01:41:10.697 --> 01:41:11.064
EXPENSE OF OUR LOCAL

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:12.533
COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK.

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:13.767
THAT THE UPPER YOU'RE DOING

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:15.202
HERE I THINK THE LEADERSHIP

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:16.804
THAT'S BEING SHOWN- TO REALLY

01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.238
DIVE INTO THE SMALL TOWN OF

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:19.573
BILL IS REALLY IMPORANT I'LL

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.877
TELL. YOU MY FINAL POINT SAN

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:24.611
DIEGO COUNTY. ARE WE ARE A RE

01:41:24.678 --> 01:41:26.747
DECARBONISE. PLAN TO ACHIEVE A

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:29.249
CARBON ZERO ECONOMY BY BY

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.551
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND A PART

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.286
OF THAT IS MOVING OFF OF THE

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:34.087
OIL. AND I THINK A PART OF THAT

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:34.988
IS GOT TO BE ASSISTED

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.490
CONTINUING EVERYTHING WE CAN'T

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:37.758
ALL THOSE FEDERAL LEASES

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:38.759
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:41.261
DISTINCT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT-

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:42.463
BUT YOU WANT TO FREEZE OUT OF

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:44.498
THESE- AND THEN AS WE DO THAT

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:47.134
BEING VERY MINDFUL. OF HELLO.

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:48.669
IT WILL IMPACT ON WORKERS AND

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:49.970
AS WE SEGMENT OUT OF ONE

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:51.405
INDUSTRY IN INTO ANOTHER DUE

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:53.307
DATE THAT BURDEN THAT IS ON ALL

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:55.142
OF US. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:56.677
GOOD JOBS GOOD MIDDLE CLASS

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:59.313
JOBS- SO THAT AS WE GO ON THE

01:41:59.379 --> 01:42:01.081
PATH TO TACKLING ISSUES OF

MILES OF MARCHES AND COASTLINE

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:30.938
THAT WILL BE PRESENT FOR YEARS

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.739
BY THE SPELL WE WERE ANGRY THAT

01:43:32.806 --> 01:43:34.374
YET AGAIN THE OIL INDUSTRY HAS

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:35.976
PROVEN ITS INABILITY TO CONTAIN

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:38.178
ITS TOXIC POLLUTION. THE

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:39.446
STRUCTURE QUITE QUITE OFTEN IN

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.615
THE FUTURE CREWS YET AGAIN THAT

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.883
EVERY PIECE OF FOSSIL FUEL

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.952
INFRASTRUCTURE IS YET ANOTHER

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:47.154
DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. AND

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:51.024
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT

01:43:51.091 --> 01:43:51.625
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:53.260
RECENTLY OLD UPDATED IN

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:56.029
DISREPAIR AND POORLY LOCATED

01:43:56.096 --> 01:43:56.830
LIKE THE FORTY YEAR OLD

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.532
PIPELINE THEY GIVE US THIS MOST

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.867
RECENT SPELL. ALL OF WHICH

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:01.902
MAKES IT INCREASINGLY

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:04.338
DANGEROUS. LOOKING BEYOND THE

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:06.440
NINE OIL PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS

01:44:06.506 --> 01:44:08.642
AND STATE WATER. THERE ARE

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:09.443
TWENTY THREE PLATFORMS IN

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:11.478
FEDERAL WATERS OFF CALIFORNIA.

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:12.713
BUT THE FACT THAT THIS TWENTY

01:44:12.779 --> 01:44:13.880
THREE PLATFORMS ARE A LITTLE

01:44:13.947 --> 01:44:15.782
FARTHER FROM SHORE SHOULD NOT

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:17.584
GIVE US MUCH COMFORT FIRST

01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:19.019
BECAUSE OIL SPILLS FROM THOSE

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.520
OPERATIONS STILL END UP IN OUR

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.488
WATER OUR BEACHES AND OUR

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.824
WILDLIFE. BUT ALSO AS WE'VE

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.792
HEARD TODAY FURTHER FROM SHORE.

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.461
ALSO MEANS UNDER STRETCHES OF

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:28.729
AGING AND DANGEROUSLY

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.430
VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE

01:44:30.497 --> 01:44:33.433
THE SEVENTEEN MILE LONG

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.101
PIPELINE WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY.

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.235
MARK WE RELY ON FEDERAL

01:44:35.302 --> 01:44:37.337
REGULATIONS TO PROTECT US FROM

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.172
OIL SPILLS IN FEDERAL WATERS.

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:41.274
FEDERAL REGULATORS CONTINUE TO

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:42.643
PROVE THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:43.610
WILLING TO ALLOW THOSE

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:45.312
PLATFORMS TO CONTINUE OPERATING

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:47.381
THE LAST DROP OF OIL. DESPITE

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.849
THE MOUNTING DANGERS OF

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.651
DECAYING INFRASTRUCTURE WELL

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:52.586
BEYOND ITS INTENDED LIFESPAN.

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.454
OUTDATED DRILLING PLANS

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.356
NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS AND

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:58.091
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS THE PAPER

01:44:58.158 --> 01:45:00.327
DECOMMISSIONING. JUST THIS YEAR

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:01.161
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:02.562
ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ISSUED A

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.698
SCATHING REPORT BUT FEDERAL

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:06.533

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.469

SIX HUNDRED MILES OF ACTIVE

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:13.373
OFFSHORE PLATFORMS. THE ONLY

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.374
WAY TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:15.809
OUR COAST FROM THIS DANGEROUS

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.444
ON LIVING INDUSTRY IS THAT

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.312
SHOPPERS OFFSHORE OPERATIONS

01:45:19.379 --> 01:45:21.248
DOWN. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:22.983
THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:25.185
UNIQUE OFFSHORE PLATFORMS. AT

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:26.853
THE EXACT SAME TIME ENDS UP

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.155
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF OIL

01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:29.389
WERE ROLLING UP ON COULD

BEACHES AND MARSHES. IN ORANGE

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:32.826
COUNTY. THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL

01:45:32.893 --> 01:45:34.161
IN CURRENT COUNTY THAT IS NOW

BEEN NO OIL IN HELP BRING

01:45:48.575 --> 01:45:49.576
GREATER THAN THE STOCK I THINK

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.478
IF. IN THE SUMMER YOU KNOW THE

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:53.113

60% SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE.

01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:58.879

IS HAVING AN- ANY SINKS TO THE

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.368
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. MANY OF

01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:43.903
THOSE TITLES ARE STILL WASHING

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.838
ASHORE AT THIS VERY MOMENT AND

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:47.707
MANY MORE WILL REMAIN AT THE

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.776
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN POISONING

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:52.478
AND KILLING SEA LIFE. AND THE

01:55:52.545 --> 01:55:54.247
TECHNIQUES WE USE TO CLEAN UP

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:55.148
HAVE NOT REALLY CHANGED IN

01:55:55.214 --> 01:55:57.383
DECADES. WELL THE TREE DWELLING

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.686
AND ENHANCE RECOVERY TECHNIQUES

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.621
TO GET TO THE HYDROCARBONS ARE

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:05.391
EVOLVING EVERY DAY. THEY STILL

01:56:05.458 --> 01:56:07.827
DO NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. WE

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:09.228
ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO

01:56:09.295 --> 01:56:11.230
GO A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY AND

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:13.399
LEAVE THE OIL IN THE GROUND.

01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:14.834
THIS MAN MADE DISASTER FURTHER

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.703
HURTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:18.104
AS HE BEACH IS ONE OF THE FEW

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:20.073
PLACES LOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:22.108
GO FOR FREE OR LOW COST

01:56:22.175 --> 01:56:24.477
RECREATION. WIESER STILL

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:26.512
FIGHTING THE GROWING INEQUITIES

01:56:26.579 --> 01:56:27.914
THAT THE BUTTON THAT MAKES US

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:30.283
SO DEEPLY EXACERBATED. AND MANY

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:31.584
BUILDABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.653
HURT BY THE OIL INDUSTRY BY

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.254
ALLOWING THEM TO DRILL NEXT TO

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:38.424
WHERE THEY LIVE WORK OR PLAY OR

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:39.659
THE REFINING OR TRANSPORTATION

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:42.161
OPERATIONS TAKE PLACE. THIS

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:44.564
BILL TOOK AWAY A PLACE. TO

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.466
ACCESS NATURE AND MANY REMAIN

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:50.203
WORRIED ABOUT THE- ONGOING

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:51.237
ISSUES AT THE BEACH. WELL WE

01:56:51.304 --> 01:56:53.439
HAVE A GREAT NEW PROPOSAL TO

01:56:53.506 --> 01:56:55.775
STOP NEW TRAILING BY GOVERNOR

01:56:55.842 --> 01:56:58.211
NEWSOM THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT

01:56:58.277 --> 01:56:59.912
NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH EXISTING.

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:02.582
WELLS BOOK ON SHORE AND OFF

01:57:02.648 --> 01:57:08.921
SHORE. THESE WELLS SHOULD HAVE

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:11.391
NEVER BEEN BUILT AND WE MUST BE

01:57:11.457 --> 01:57:12.392
COMMISSIONED THEM AS SOON AS

01:57:12.458 --> 01:57:14.861
POSSIBLE MANY CORPORATIONS KEEP

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:16.162
DRILLING BECAUSE THEY ELECTIONS

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:17.296
TOO EXPENSIVE THAT THE

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:19.599
COMMISSION. EVEN WHEN OIL THE

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:21.501
OIL THAT IS EXTRACTED IS LOW

01:57:21.567 --> 01:57:22.335
QUALITY AND EXPENSIVE TO

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.370
REFINE. BUT THAT DISCUSSION

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:25.671
DOES NOT CONSIDER THE TOTAL

01:57:25.738 --> 01:57:27.573
COST TO THE PUBLIC OF DRILLING

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.442
OPERATIONS FROM CLEAN UP COSTS

01:57:29.509 --> 01:57:31.577
TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

01:57:31.644 --> 01:57:33.513
PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS ESPECIALLY

01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:35.481
WHEN CORPORATIONS WORK HARD TO

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:37.417
MAXIMIZE PROFITS BY CUTTING

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:39.886
CORNERS EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES.

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:42.622
AND MANY MANY MANY END UP THE

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:44.457
CLAIM BACK FROM SEA TO AVOID

01:57:44.524 --> 01:57:46.359
ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOCIALIZE

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:51.564
THE LOSSES THE CLEANUP. HEALTH

01:57:51.631 --> 01:57:53.733
AND THE COMMISSIONING COSTS.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.501
PUBLIC HEALTH MUST COME FIRST

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:57.804
AS WELL AS BIO DIVERSITY BUT

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:59.071
RIGHT NOW CORPORATE PROFITS ARE

01:57:59.138 --> 01:58:01.240
TAKING PRIORITY AND THAT HAS

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:03.609
GOT TO STOP. ALEX FRACTION

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:05.311
REFINING AND BURNING

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:06.479
CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLIMATE

01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:07.914
CRISIS AND CREATES HAS

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.950
SACRIFICED STORMS BUT LOW

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:12.985
INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR NEXT.

01:58:13.052 --> 01:58:14.487
THE OCEAN IS NOT A PROFIT

01:58:14.554 --> 01:58:16.489
CENTER AND IT'S NOT A JOB IT'S

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:17.857
AN ECOSYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:19.091
PROTECTED FROM DESTRUCTIVE

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.993

01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:23.596
BE ENJOYED BY ALL CALIFORNIANS

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:25.231
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THE

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:27.233
ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE TODAY WILL

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:30.937
DEFINE WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:32.872

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:54.600
PLATFORMS. I THINK I'M GONNA

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.368
START IS THE DRILLING THAT WE

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:57.937
CURRENTLY HAVE HERE IN

02:02:58.003 --> 02:03:00.873
HUNTINGTON BEACH IT'S LESS THAN

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:01.474
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.609
A YEAR SO EVEN THOUGHOUR

HIGH SCHOOL AS THE OILERS THIS

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:08.714
TOWN HAS REALLY PIVOTED FROM

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:10.583
BEING AN OIL BOOMTOWN WHERE

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.384
MUCH MORE OF A TOURIST TOWN WE

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:14.320
RELY ON VISITORS COMING TO AN

02:03:14.386 --> 02:03:16.188
AGENT BEACH- IT IS A

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.057
SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR GENERAL

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:21.894

SIMILAR COMMENTS I KNOW THAT

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:35.741
YOUR COUNTY WAS NOT HIT AS HARD

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:37.243
AND I THINK REPUTATION HE

02:03:37.309 --> 02:03:38.043
PROBABLY WAS NOT AS AFFECTED

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:39.078
BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY.

ORDER BACK TO THE STORE. AS

02:03:52.024 --> 02:03:52.958
WHAT FOLKS IN ORANGE COUNTY

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.760
EXPERIENCE. BUT IT'S NOT

02:03:54.827 --> 02:03:56.595
POSSIBLE. THERE'S NOTHING

02:03:56.662 --> 02:03:58.464
POSITIVE THAT COMES OUT OF THIS

02:03:58.531 --> 02:03:59.398
FOR ANY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:01.300

ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVATING

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:05.070
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.173
WITH STAFF BEING. IS OBVIOUSLY

02:04:07.239 --> 02:04:08.240
SOME CROSSING COURT BY STATE

02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:09.441
AGENCIES AND OTHERS FOR THE

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:11.076
DEPLOYMENT OF BONES THE CLEANUP

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:13.045
TEAMS WERE DOWN HERE. BUT AGAIN

YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR

02:04:14.647 --> 02:04:16.582
YOUR BEST BEACH. ARE YOUR

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:17.817
BEACHES THAT PEOPLE TRAVEL FROM

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:19.718
ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME AND

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.288
WHILE WE ARE. IN CARLSBAD AND

BROADCAST WITH HARDBALL'S

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:28.861
WASHING UP ON THE SHORE- THAT

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:31.363
THAT DOES NOT HELP. IT DOESN'T

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.299
HELP AT ALL AND SO I THINK AND

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:34.200
THAT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:36.802
ACCOUNT. ON KNOWN LONGER TERM

02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:39.738

HABITATS FOR ALL THOSE OTHER

02:04:42.107 --> 02:04:43.576
THINGS THAT ARE THERE AND SO

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:45.110
IT'S JUST AN INDUSTRY WHERE.

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:46.846
FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:47.746
STANDPOINT THERE IS NOTHING

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:49.782
POSITIVE. ARE THERE WE EVER

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:52.384
GET. OUT OF THE OFFSHORE OIL

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:54.553
INDUSTRY IT IS ONLY NOW. AND IT

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.188
ALWAYS TENDS TO COME OUT SO

02:04:56.255 --> 02:04:57.690
AGAIN NO WHERE NEAR WHAT ARE

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:59.592
FOLKS OR SHOUTING WENT THROUGH-

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.293
AND THE WAY THEY- REACTED AND

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:02.728
DEALT WITH THIS IS ADMIRABLE

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:05.097
AND REALLY TO BE COMMENDED- BUT

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:06.131
BUT CERTAINLY NOTHING NOTHING

02:05:06.198 --> 02:05:07.900
POSITIVE CAN COME TO SAN DIEGO

IMPACTS. ARE BASED ON OUR

02:05:22.715 --> 02:05:24.383

WHAT DO WE KNOW YET WE HAVE A

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:33.826
SENSE OF HOW BAD THIS WILL BE-

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:34.560
AS FAR AS THE BIO. ENVIRONMENT

02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:36.695
IMPACTS. NO I'M DEFINITELY.

LEVEL AND WAS NOT ON THE GROUND

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.784
BUT I CAN'T SAY THOUGH. FOR

02:05:58.851 --> 02:06:01.553
SURE IS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:03.689
LONGER THAN ONE SEASON TO SEE

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:06.191
WHAT THE FULL IMPACT ARE YOU

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.159
THE LOCAL WILDLIFE AND OF

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:09.762
COURSE. IT IS WETLANDS AND

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:12.097
MARSHES BUT OFTEN ARE THE MOST

02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:14.433
DIFFICULT AND TAKE THE LONGEST

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.935
TO RECOVER FROM THE START OF

02:06:16.001 --> 02:06:18.504
IMPACTS BUT- BUT I AS FAR AS

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:21.040
THE SPECIFICS OF THIS SO NOW I

02:06:21.106 --> 02:06:22.608
HAVE TO DEFER TO OTHERS IRAN IS

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:24.410
A MAJOR KERR REFERRED TO WE

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.512
HAVE A SERIES OF- SOMEWHAT

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:29.081
CONNECTED- PRESERVES- IN

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:31.116
NEWPORT BEACH AND- HUNTINGTON

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:33.252
BEACH THAT YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE

02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:33.886
TO SEE IF YOU SET THE

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.788
SUGGESTION IS THAT OKAY. I

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:36.522
GUESS MY LAST QUESTION FOR MR

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:39.091
STAFFERS- HAVE WE SEEN ANY KIND

02:06:39.158 --> 02:06:41.927
OF RELUCTANCE BY SURFERS TO GET

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:43.529
BACK INTO THE WATER- BECAUSE OF

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.397
THE OIL SPILLS WHAT SORT OF

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:50.402
YOUR OBSERVATION. ON THE IMPACT

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:51.003
ON THE SURFING COMMUNITY. YEAH

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:51.870
YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CENTER

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:54.206
MAN I MEAN THERE'S BEEN- WE'VE

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:55.607
BEEN FLOODED WITH CALLS AND

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.176
QUESTIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF

02:06:57.242 --> 02:06:59.378
THE SPELL- NOT ONLY ABOUT YOU

02:06:59.445 --> 02:07:01.380
KNOW SAFETY OF SURFING BUT-

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.849
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS- I

02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:05.417
DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE JUST THAT

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:06.986
THE QUICK CAFFERTY THE UNIFIED

02:07:07.052 --> 02:07:08.687
COMMAND. TO GET THE WATER

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.756
QUALITY TESTING UP AND RUNNING

02:07:10.823 --> 02:07:13.192
AND- YOU KNOW I THINK FOR

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:14.493
GROUPS LIKE SURFRIDER THERE'S

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.495
SORT OF A BALANCE BETWEEN. WE

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:18.430
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:19.965
PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROTECTED BUT

02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:21.934
WE ALSO WANT TO FIGHT FOR

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:24.003
PUBLIC ACCESS AND SO. THIS WAS

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:25.904
A CHALLENGING SITUATION I THINK

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:27.706
COLLECTIVELY WHEN THE WATER

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.842
QUALITY DATA WASN'T THERE

02:07:29.908 --> 02:07:31.744
DURING THAT FIRST WEEK AND SO.

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.245
I YOU KNOW I THINK ONE THING

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:34.813
THAT COULD MAYBE BE APPLIED FOR

02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:37.716
FUTURE SPELLS. IS TO FIGURE OUT

02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:39.651
HOW TO GET THAT TESTING UP AND

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:42.521
RUNNING MORE QUICKLY- YOU KNOW

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:44.123
MEASURING SAMPLING WATER

02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:46.492
QUALITY FOR OIL CONTAMINATION.

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:47.893
IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING THAN

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.261
SAMPLING FOR BACTERIAL

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.063
CONTAMINATION. STAR TYPICAL

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.798
BEACH MONITORING PROGRAMS IN

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:54.500
ORANGE COUNTY AND BEYOND. THEIR

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:56.769
TESTING FOR ENTEROCOCCUS WHICH

02:07:56.835 --> 02:07:58.337
IS WHAT OUR OUR SURFRIDER

02:07:58.404 --> 02:07:59.772
VOLUNTEER WATER QUALITY LABS

02:07:59.838 --> 02:08:03.008
TESTS FOR. SOIL CONTAMINATION.

02:08:03.075 --> 02:08:04.510
T'S A DIFFERENT BEAST IT'S

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.311
MORE COMPLICATED TO TEST FOR.

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.780
AND FRANKLY THERE AREN'T A

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:10.015
CLEAR SET OF GUIDELINES ARE

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:12.317
THRESHOLDS FOR. PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:18.891
AND SO IT. HAS CREATED SORT OF-

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:20.626
A MORE SET A LESS KLAY STAND

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:23.462
FOR WHAT'S ARE NOT- I THINKTHE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.197
SURFING COMMUNITY THOSE OF US

02:08:25.264 --> 02:08:26.331
WHO YOU KNOW WANT TO SEE THE

02:08:26.398 --> 02:08:28.133
DATA AND WHATNOT. WE HAVE SORT

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.368
OF DEFERRED TO THAT THE

02:08:29.435 --> 02:08:31.437
COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE OF THE

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:34.306
AGENCIES ARE AND THAT DOES LOOK

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:35.007
THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.775
AGENCIES. TO SAY THAT THEY'RE

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:38.677
DOING THE TESTING AND THEY'RE

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.679
NOT FINDING DETECTABLE LEVELS

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:43.315
OF OIL AND SO. I THINK FOR MOST

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:45.084
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN

02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:47.419
INCLUDING ME THAT'S BEEN ENOUGH

02:08:47.486 --> 02:08:48.654
TO SAY YOU WANT TO GO SURFING

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.756
BUT- BUT THOSE QUESTIONS REMAIN

02:08:50.823 --> 02:08:52.424
AND- AND WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:54.760
JUST TO CAST. YOUR CHECK BEFORE

02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:58.997
YOU GO AND CHECKTHE WEBSITES.

02:08:59.064 --> 02:08:59.498
IN YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:00.165
RESOURCES. THANK YOU I GUESS MY

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:01.500
LAST COMMENT IS IT MAYBE MORE

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:02.935
COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT-

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:05.170

FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:08.540
A LOT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:09:08.607 --> 02:09:09.341
DON'T REALIZE IS WHILE THE

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:10.776
BEACHES THAT I REPRESENT AND

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:11.443
THEN GOING TO NEWPORT AND

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:13.178
HUNTINGTON. ARE OFTEN THOUGHT

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:16.081
OF AS VERY WEALTHY. AREAS THEY

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:17.483
ACTUALLY PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:19.418
BEACHES AND COASTS FOR.

02:09:19.485 --> 02:09:21.854
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.088
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:09:23.155 --> 02:09:24.189
LOWER INCOME THAT OUR

02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:26.558
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- SO THE

02:09:26.625 --> 02:09:28.026
TICKET LOSS OF THESE BEACHES

02:09:28.093 --> 02:09:30.028
FOR ANYBODY'S IS A REAL ACCESS

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:31.663
ISSUE BUT- I DON'T IF YOU HAVE

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:32.564

02:14:44.342 --> 02:14:46.378
REVIEW OF THE EXISTING

SPAN AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONAL

02:15:07.732 --> 02:15:09.267
PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:11.770
ORIGINALLY- BIRD BURCHILL

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.772
CONSTRUCTED. AND THAT THAT

02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:15.173
WOULD PROVIDE MANY

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:17.342
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO FIVE

02:15:17.409 --> 02:15:20.111
SPECIFIC PIECES THAT ARE KNOWN

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:22.013
TO BE EXISTING HAZARDS THE

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.515
DOWNSIDE OF THAT THE FLIP SIDE

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:25.217

IN ORDER TO RECOUP THOSE

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:42.467
INVESTMENTS AND I THINK THIS IS

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:44.102
EXACTLY THE POINT THE POINT AT

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:45.871

FINANCIAL DEMANDS OF THE

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:03.588

PREVENTED AND SO- YOU KNOW I

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:16.328

02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:34.579
PRONE TO HAPPEN AGAIN UNLESS WE

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:36.481

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:38.350
COMMISSION ON THE ARTS AFTER

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:41.786
WELLS AND- SO IT WILL BE. GREAT

02:17:41.853 --> 02:17:43.955
TO SEE A BILL TO PUT A PASS ON

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:45.657
TO THE COMMISSION DOES WELLS.

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:46.958

SAFEGUARDS IN AND TRY TO

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:52.163
MITIGATE ALL WE WANT BUT- I

02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:53.164
HAVE A SAYING THAT THE ONLY

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.833
PIPELINE THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT

02:17:54.899 --> 02:17:56.234
THE ONE THAT HE'S NEVER BUILT.

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.969
AND WE SEE HOW THESE

02:17:58.036 --> 02:17:59.437
INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING US

02:17:59.504 --> 02:18:02.173
AND- A LOT OF THESE WELLS ARE

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:05.043
NOW FORTY FIFTY YEARS OLD AND-

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.277
LIKE MY OTHER COLLEAGUE WAS

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:07.479
SAYING IF THERE'S AN

FROM THEM. SO HOW DO WE MEET

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.489

BETWEEN THE LIABILITIES THE

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:53.937
RISKS AND THE- THE

02:36:54.004 --> 02:36:57.474
CAPITALIZATION- OR FUNDING SET

02:36:57.541 --> 02:36:59.743
ASIDE CURRENTLY TO DEAL NOT

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:01.678
JUST WITH- POLLUTION EVENTS

02:37:01.745 --> 02:37:04.248
LIKE THE ONES WE'VE SEEN BUT-

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:07.451
ALSO DECOMMISSIONING COSTS- I'M

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:09.953
I'M CURIOUS- IF PARTICULARLY

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:12.222
WITH RESPECT TO- THE

02:37:12.289 --> 02:37:15.893
PLATFORMING QUESTION- WE'VE

02:37:15.959 --> 02:37:21.865
SEEN REPORTS THAT- PROXIMITY.

02:37:21.932 --> 02:37:22.466
TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:37:22.533 --> 02:37:22.900
MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:37:22.966 --> 02:37:24.768
DECOMMISSIONING COSTS ON ON

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:27.704
THOSE PARTICULAR OPERATIONS

02:37:27.771 --> 02:37:30.307
BUT- WE KNOW THAT AMPLIFIES

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:31.608
BEEN RECENTLY RE CAPITALIZE AT

02:37:31.675 --> 02:37:34.444
A BANKRUPTCY- AS WELL AS BEING

02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:36.446
CITED FOR NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS

02:37:36.513 --> 02:37:37.247
BY FEDERAL REGULATORS IN THE

02:37:37.314 --> 02:37:40.317
MEANTIME. WHAT HAPPENS IF

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:44.254
AMPLIFY- DECIDES TO DECLARE

02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:49.459
BANKRUPTCY. I'M HAPPY TO TRY TO

02:37:49.526 --> 02:37:51.762
ADDRESS THAT- THAT- FOR

02:37:51.829 --> 02:37:54.264
PLATFORMS- ARE THE THREE THAT

02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:56.066
AMPLIFY OPERATES IN FEDERAL

02:37:56.133 --> 02:37:58.502
WATERS- OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL

02:37:58.569 --> 02:38:00.838
GOVERNMENT THROUGH AND BESSIE-

02:38:00.904 --> 02:38:03.440
AND BONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:06.143
ENSURING THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE.

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.145
BONDS AND OTHER- LIABILITY

02:38:08.212 --> 02:38:10.647
PROTECTION MECHANISMS IN PLACE

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:12.583
AS PART OF THE FEDERAL LEASING

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:15.886
LEASE AND LEASING PROCESS. AT

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:16.820
LEAST FROM THE STATE LANDS

02:38:16.887 --> 02:38:18.956
COMMISSION AND- WE DO NOT HAVE

02:38:19.022 --> 02:38:21.225
ANY JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OF THE

02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:23.560
STATE'S THREE MILE- BOUNDARY

02:38:23.627 --> 02:38:25.762
HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY THAT PIPELINE

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:28.665
DOES CROSS INTO STATE WATERS

02:38:28.732 --> 02:38:31.802
AND AS PART OF OUR LEAST- WITH-

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:33.971
SAN PEDRO BAY PIPELINE COMPANY

02:38:34.037 --> 02:38:36.406
A SUBSIDIARY OF AMPLIFY. WE

02:38:36.473 --> 02:38:38.575
RECENTLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

02:38:38.642 --> 02:38:41.345
INCREASED OUR BOND AMOUNT-

02:38:41.411 --> 02:38:43.347
POWER AT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED

02:38:43.413 --> 02:38:45.883
TO MANAGE AND HOLD ON TO EIGHT

02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:48.151
POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS PLUS

02:38:48.218 --> 02:38:50.087
THERE IS A PARENTAL GUARANTEE-

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:52.856
FROM AMPLIFY- IN ADDITION TO

02:38:52.923 --> 02:38:55.058
THAT THERE IS A FOUR POINT

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:55.959
THREE MILLION DOLLAR SINKING

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:59.496

02:38:59.563 --> 02:39:01.565
DECOMMISSIONING IN THE ENTIRETY

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:02.432
OF STATE WATER SO THAT WOULD

02:39:02.499 --> 02:39:03.967
COVER NOT ONLY AND THE STATE

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:07.638
LANDS COMMISSION LEASE BUT THAT

02:39:07.704 --> 02:39:08.472
PORTION OF THE PIPELINE- IT.

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:11.041
LONG BEACH MANA. NOW OBVIOUSLY

02:39:11.108 --> 02:39:13.176
A PARENTAL GUARANTEE- ONLY GOES

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:15.345
SO FAR WHEN THAT- PARENT

02:39:15.412 --> 02:39:17.814
COMPANY DROPS INTO BANKRUPTCY

02:39:17.881 --> 02:39:19.182
WE DO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

02:39:19.249 --> 02:39:21.385
RECENTLY UNFORTUNATELY WITH OIL

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:23.086
AND GAS COMPANY'S DROPPING INTO

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:25.989
BANKRUPTCY AND- AND ABANDONING

02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.557
THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO RESTORE

02:39:27.624 --> 02:39:29.593
THE LEASED PREMISES- I HAD

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:31.962
BECAUSE- IT SUITS OUR ECONOMIC

02:39:32.029 --> 02:39:34.798
AND BUSINESS NEEDS- WE ARE.

02:39:34.865 --> 02:39:40.037
ACTIVELY PURSUING- AT DEAD.

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.905

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:48.178
OPERATORS ASSOCIATED WITH- SOME

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:49.246
FEDERAL LEASES WHERE WE

02:39:49.313 --> 02:39:50.514
RECENTLY TERMINATED THE

02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:53.283
PIPELINE IN STATE WATERS AND-

02:39:53.350 --> 02:39:55.319
IT'S IT IS- VERY VERY

02:39:55.385 --> 02:39:56.787
CHALLENGING THAT FEDERAL

02:39:56.853 --> 02:39:59.790
BANKRUPTCY LAWS- DO NOT OPERATE

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:03.260
IN FAVOR OF CREDITORS- OR- NON

SECURED CREDITORS INCLUDING THE

02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:06.830
STATE. AND SO AS PART OF OUR

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:08.198
EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST FIVE

02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:11.034
YEARS- WE HAVE APPROACHED OUR

02:40:11.101 --> 02:40:14.204
OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LESS FEES

02:40:14.271 --> 02:40:15.572
TO INCREASE THAT LIABILITY

02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:18.208
PROTECTION NOT JUST WITH BONDS-

02:40:18.275 --> 02:40:21.144
WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT COVER. ALL

02:40:21.211 --> 02:40:22.846
THE DECOMMISSIONING- AND

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:24.348
PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT COSTS

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:25.916
BUT ALSO THROUGH OTHER CREATIVE

02:40:25.983 --> 02:40:28.552
MEASURES LIKE SECURING-

02:40:28.618 --> 02:40:33.890
PRIORITY LANES ON- PRIVATE LAND-

02:40:33.957 --> 02:40:35.258
SEEKING FUNDS WHERE WE CAN

02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:37.828
ACCESS ACTUAL CASH TO COVER-

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.763
OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER

02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:41.965
MECHANISMS- SO WE ARE

02:40:42.032 --> 02:40:43.200
DEFINITELY LEARNING FROM OUR

02:40:43.266 --> 02:40:45.302
EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST. FIVE

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:47.504
YEARS AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

02:40:47.571 --> 02:40:49.573
WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF

02:40:49.639 --> 02:40:52.576
LIABILITY PROTECTION MEASURES

02:40:52.642 --> 02:40:53.143
TO PROTECT THE STATE AND ALL

02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:55.212
CALIFORNIANS. AND JUST TO

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:56.847
FOLLOW UP ON THAT WE KNOW SHELL

02:40:56.913 --> 02:40:59.916
WAS THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER FOR

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:00.951
THIS BETA UNIT IN THE OIL

02:41:01.018 --> 02:41:05.522
FIELD- PRECEDING CCMA BUT- IT

02:41:05.589 --> 02:41:08.592
SHALL ULTIMATELY. LIABLE FOR

02:41:08.658 --> 02:41:10.160
THOSE DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IN

02:41:10.227 --> 02:41:12.562
THE EVENT THAT AN AMPLIFIER OR

02:41:12.629 --> 02:41:16.800
OR SUBSIDIARY- YOU KNOW IT

02:41:16.867 --> 02:41:17.968
WOULD IT WOULD DECLARE

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:19.770
BANKRUPTCY IS THAT IS THERE

02:41:19.836 --> 02:41:21.171
DOES IT DOES THEIR RECOURSE TO

02:41:21.238 --> 02:41:24.574
THE ORIGINAL OPERATOR OR- OR

02:41:24.641 --> 02:41:26.576
NOT. AND THAT IS A QUESTION

02:41:26.643 --> 02:41:28.612
THAT IS- CAN BE MORE COMPLETELY

02:41:28.678 --> 02:41:29.713
ANSWERED BY THE FEDERAL

02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:32.282
GOVERNMENT- I DO KNOW THAT THE

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:33.683
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE

02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:35.085
CERTAIN LAWS ON THE BOOK AND

02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:36.486
IT'S REFLECTED IN CERTAINLY

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:38.055
SAYS WHERE THEY CAN GO BACK TO

02:41:38.121 --> 02:41:40.357
PRIOR PRIOR OPERATORS. TO COVER

02:41:40.424 --> 02:41:41.825
DECOMMISSIONING COSTS BUT I'M

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:44.828
NOT SURE HOW FAR BACK THEY CAN-

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:47.664
THAT GRAB THE PRIOR OPERATOR SO

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:49.766
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT DIRECTLY

02:41:49.833 --> 02:41:51.268
FOR THIS UNIT BECAUSE IT IS A

02:41:51.334 --> 02:41:52.402
FEDERAL WATERS AND GOVERNED BY

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:54.538
FEDERAL LAW ONLY SAYS- BUT WE

02:41:54.604 --> 02:41:57.908
DO HAVE SIMILAR- SITUATIONS

02:41:57.974 --> 02:42:00.510
AND- FIRST. APPSWARM SO FOR

02:42:00.577 --> 02:42:04.381
EXAMPLE- WITH PLATFORM AND- D.

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:05.682
CORE IS THE CURRENT OPERATOR

02:42:05.749 --> 02:42:07.584
BUT AS PART OF THEIR

02:42:07.651 --> 02:42:09.519
ACQUISITION OF THOSE LEASES.

02:42:09.586 --> 02:42:11.321
FREEPORT MAC MORAN WHO WAS THE

02:42:11.388 --> 02:42:13.590
PRIOR ART OPERATOR IS STILL ON

02:42:13.657 --> 02:42:14.491
THE HOOK FOR DECOMMISSIONING

02:42:14.558 --> 02:42:18.495
COSTS. SO EVERY- SITUATION IS A

02:42:18.562 --> 02:42:19.796
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DEPENDING

02:42:19.863 --> 02:42:21.565
ON THE BUSINESS DEAL THAT WAS

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:23.133
STRUCK BETWEEN THE VARIOUS

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.835
OPERATORS AND ASSIGNING A

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:27.604
LEASEHOLD INTEREST- BUT- THAT'S

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:28.638
THE SITUATION OUT PLATFORM

02:42:28.705 --> 02:42:31.541
ASTOR SIMILARLY AND THE SANTA

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:32.142
BARBARA CHANNEL WITH THAT ARM

02:42:32.209 --> 02:42:35.112
HOLLY- WHEN DENICO ACQUIRED THE

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:37.547
LEASEHOLD- INTEREST FROM EXXON

02:42:37.614 --> 02:42:40.650
MOBIL. AND EXXON AS A CONDITION

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:41.918
OF THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL OF

02:42:41.985 --> 02:42:44.087
ASSIGNMENT EXXON MOBIL IS STILL

02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:46.690
RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH. PLUGGING

02:42:46.756 --> 02:42:47.090
AND ABANDONING AND

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:49.426
DECOMMISSIONING PLUGIN BANNING

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:50.193
THE WELLS AND DECOMMISSIONING

02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.696
THE PLATFORM SO WHILE THE STATE

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:55.365
HAS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR-

02:42:55.432 --> 02:42:56.800
THAT DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND

02:42:56.867 --> 02:42:59.302
MAINTENANCE AND ESSENTIALLY-

02:42:59.369 --> 02:43:01.471
MANNING THEPLATFORM. EXXON

02:43:01.538 --> 02:43:04.708
MOBIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:06.076
FOR AND IMPLEMENTING THE

02:43:06.143 --> 02:43:07.878
PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT-

02:43:07.944 --> 02:43:09.980
PROGRAM AND ULTIMATELY

02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:11.615
DECOMMISSIONING THAT PLATFORM.

02:43:11.681 --> 02:43:12.916
SO IT'S REALLY A CASE BY CASE

02:43:12.983 --> 02:43:15.519
BASIS DEPENDING ON THE HISTORY

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:17.053
OF THE LEASE ASSIGNMENTS AND

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.722
THE PRIOR OPERATORS AND THE

02:43:18.788 --> 02:43:19.656
BUSINESS DEALS ASSOCIATED

02:43:19.723 --> 02:43:21.791
ABOUT. THANKS FOR THE VERY LAST

OF- INQUIRY- YOU'D MENTIONED

02:43:26.296 --> 02:43:27.497
THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:28.565
SINKING FUND THAT HAVE BEEN SET

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:30.867
ASIDE UNDER IT I RECENTLY GO

02:43:30.934 --> 02:43:32.002
SHE ATION OF BELIEVES IN TWENTY

02:43:32.068 --> 02:43:36.306
NINETEEN- THAT. THAT SET ASIDE

02:43:36.373 --> 02:43:39.543
WAS WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR- FOR THE

02:43:39.609 --> 02:43:40.710
PARTICULAR FIELD WE'RE TALKING

02:43:40.777 --> 02:43:41.945
ABOUT HERE TODAY IN THE

02:43:42.012 --> 02:43:43.813
PIPELINE SPECIFICALLY THAT'S IN

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.115
STATE WATERS. DO YOU HAVE AN

02:43:45.182 --> 02:43:47.784
ESTIMATE OF THE DECOMMISSIONING

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:51.021
PORTION OF. THAT FACILITY THE

02:43:51.087 --> 02:43:52.722
PIPELINE IS FROM US TO WE HAVE

02:43:52.789 --> 02:43:54.457
A TO HAVE A COST ESTIMATE AT

02:43:54.524 --> 02:43:55.859
THIS POINT FOR WHAT WHAT

02:43:55.926 --> 02:43:57.127
DECOMMISSIONING WOULD COST AND

02:43:57.194 --> 02:44:02.766
THAT'S. IN SAN PEDRO BAY AREA.

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:04.534
YEAH THAT'S SO IN TERMS OF THAT.

02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:05.835
PIPELINE AS OF OUR- AND- THE

02:44:05.902 --> 02:44:07.470
COMMISSION INCREASING THE BOND

02:44:07.537 --> 02:44:10.740
REQUIREMENT- AT AS WELL AS-

02:44:10.807 --> 02:44:14.211
THAT SINKING FUND. WE ESTIMATED

02:44:14.277 --> 02:44:15.278
FOR THE STATE'S PORTION

02:44:15.345 --> 02:44:16.813
SUGGESTS THAT FOUR POINT FOUR

02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:19.015
MILE PORTION OF THE PIPELINE

02:44:19.082 --> 02:44:20.383
THAT THE DECOMMISSIONING COSTS

02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:22.619
WOULD BE- ABOUT TEN MILLION

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:26.256
DOLLARS SO BETWEEN- THAT. EIGHT

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:27.791
POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR BOND

02:44:27.857 --> 02:44:30.760
AND THEN ARE PROPORTIONAL-

02:44:30.827 --> 02:44:31.928
ALLOCATION OF THAT SINKING

02:44:31.995 --> 02:44:34.698
FUND- WE CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.166
FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING OF THE

02:44:36.233 --> 02:44:37.634

COST HAS ONLY INCREASED-

02:49:12.609 --> 02:49:13.543
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF

BECAUSE- I'M TRYING TO TAKE IN

02:49:24.554 --> 02:49:25.088
WHEN I CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE

02:49:25.154 --> 02:49:27.924
BEFORE. TRYING TO TAKE A

02:49:27.991 --> 02:49:31.561
COMPREHENSIVE VIEW. AS TO HOW

02:49:31.628 --> 02:49:34.230
WE CAN INTELLIGENTLY. ELIMINATE

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:35.431
I THINK IT WAS A TWENTY THREE

02:49:35.498 --> 02:49:36.432
OFFSHORE WELLS AND WE'VE GOT

02:49:36.499 --> 02:49:37.967

DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN THE WAY

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.273
THAT REMAIN THE MINUSES RICH TO

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:45.408
TAXPAYERS. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS

02:49:45.475 --> 02:49:46.709

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:47.877
DEALS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A

02:49:47.944 --> 02:49:49.979
GUARANTEE OR NOT. IT YOU WHAT

02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:52.148
WHAT I EXPERIENCED BEFORE IN

02:49:52.215 --> 02:49:53.650
THIS COMMITTEE WAS THAT WE HAD

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:59.889
SITUATIONS. WHERE THESE BIG

02:49:59.956 --> 02:50:00.790
COAST SOUL LAW OFF. THESE WELL

02:50:00.857 --> 02:50:01.591
TO GET THE LAST DRAW OF OIL TO

02:50:01.658 --> 02:50:03.159
A SMALL OP WHO THEN FILED. AND

02:50:03.226 --> 02:50:05.161
THEN THAT WE HAVE NO RECOURSE

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:07.096

TAXPAYERS MAXIMIZE THE SPEED

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:20.677
WITH WHICH WE CAN GET THESE

02:50:20.743 --> 02:50:22.946
THINGS GONE RIGHT IT MAKES SOME

02:50:23.012 --> 02:50:24.647

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:34.417
TO SHUT THEM DOWN WE HAVE NO

02:51:34.484 --> 02:51:36.452
RISK. IT'S A IT'S AN

02:51:36.519 --> 02:51:38.354
OCEANOGRAPHIC BENEFIT WE SEE IT

02:51:38.421 --> 02:51:40.023
HAPPEN ALL OVER THE WORLD.

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:41.491
JENNIFER A BUNCH OF REASONS WE

02:51:41.557 --> 02:51:42.091
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT

02:51:42.158 --> 02:51:44.527
DONE. BUT AGAIN IT'S TRYING TO

02:51:44.594 --> 02:51:45.662
HAVE A RATIONAL APPROACH

02:51:45.728 --> 02:51:46.696
BECAUSE HERE WE ARE THAT

02:51:46.763 --> 02:51:47.964
ANOTHER PROBLEM EVERYBODY'S

02:51:48.031 --> 02:51:49.365
GOING CRAZY IT'S ON THE FRONT

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:51.167
PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER. AND

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:52.335
WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK IN THE

02:51:52.402 --> 02:51:54.337
MORASS OF LIABILITY OF NEW

02:51:54.404 --> 02:51:55.805
BUDGET REQUESTS OF WHO YOU'RE

02:51:55.872 --> 02:51:57.507
GOING TO SUE IT'S A FULL

02:51:57.573 --> 02:51:58.975
EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR LAWYERS NO

02:51:59.042 --> 02:52:01.077
DISRESPECT TO LAWYERS BUT- IT

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:02.111
DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE

02:52:02.178 --> 02:52:03.946
DELIVERABLES IN THE DEFINITION

02:52:04.013 --> 02:52:05.448
OF SUCCESS IN MY JUDGMENT FOR

02:52:05.515 --> 02:52:06.916
ALL OF US LANCE COMMISSION

02:52:06.983 --> 02:52:07.984
COASTAL COMMISSION THE

02:52:08.051 --> 02:52:11.821
LEGISLATURE. IS SHUT HIM DOWN.

02:52:11.888 --> 02:52:13.256
GET AS MUCH EITHER NO COST TO

02:52:13.322 --> 02:52:15.525
TAXPAYERS. RISKS TO THE

02:52:15.591 --> 02:52:17.627
ENVIRONMENT AND IS MUCH MONEY

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:19.762
INTO A FUND TO PROTECT THE

02:52:19.829 --> 02:52:21.831
OCEAN THAT NO TAXPAYERS COST AS

02:52:21.898 --> 02:52:23.566
POSSIBLE SO I THINK WE JUST PUT

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:24.367
THIS BACK OUT THERE BECAUSE

02:52:24.434 --> 02:52:25.134
THIS COMMITTEE'S BEEN

02:52:25.201 --> 02:52:26.436
DELIBERATING THESE THINGS AND I

02:52:26.502 --> 02:52:27.970
KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUE.

02:52:28.037 --> 02:52:29.138
THAT NO ONE WANTS TO DO WITH

02:52:29.205 --> 02:52:31.374
THE- COMPANIES BUT THE REALITY

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:32.909
OF THE SITUATION IS. YOU'RE

02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:34.944
GONNA HAVE TO CREATE A

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:36.379
STRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR

02:52:36.446 --> 02:52:38.047
EVERYBODY OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING

02:52:38.114 --> 02:52:39.916
TO CONTINUE LEE. BE IN THIS

02:52:39.982 --> 02:52:41.484
SITUATION THERE WILL BE ANOTHER

02:52:41.551 --> 02:52:42.952
SPILL THERE WILL BE ANOTHER

02:52:43.019 --> 02:52:44.220
PROBLEM THERE WILL BE ANOTHER

02:52:44.287 --> 02:52:46.456
BANKRUPTCY. AND WHAT ARE WE

02:52:46.522 --> 02:52:48.257
DOING AS A GOVERNMENT. TO GET

02:52:48.324 --> 02:52:49.092
IT DONE BECAUSE I WOULD

02:52:49.158 --> 02:52:50.693
SUSPECT. THAT IF WE DONE WHAT

02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:52.762
PRINCE HAD DONE WHAT I FOLLOWED

02:52:52.829 --> 02:52:53.596
UP ON PRINCE WHEN I FIRST GOT

02:52:53.663 --> 02:52:55.531
HERE. A LOT OF THESE THINGS

02:52:55.598 --> 02:52:56.466
WOULD BE IN THE PROCESS OF

02:52:56.532 --> 02:52:57.800
BEING DECOMMISSIONED TODAY AND

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.368
WE HAVE A LOT LESS RISK AND WE

02:52:59.435 --> 02:53:00.603
DID WE'D BE A MUCH BETTER

02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:01.204
POSITION TO TRY TO GO ON SO

02:53:01.270 --> 02:53:02.739
LONG BUT- IT WILL WORK ON THIS

02:53:02.805 --> 02:53:04.006
ISSUE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I

02:53:04.073 --> 02:53:04.507
JUST THINK IT'S REALLY

02:53:04.574 --> 02:53:06.309
IMPORTANT AND I THINK. MAYBE

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:07.510
NOW WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WE

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:08.911
CAN DRAW THE ATTENTION I LIKE

02:53:08.978 --> 02:53:10.179
MR CHAIRMAN. IT TO YOUR

02:53:10.246 --> 02:53:11.380
COMMITTEE INTO YOUR LEADERSHIP

02:53:11.447 --> 02:53:13.549
KIND OF CORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE

02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:16.753
APPROACH. TO JUST GET IT DONE.

02:53:16.819 --> 02:53:18.621
THANK YOU. PRETTY SURE THE

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:19.822
COMMON IN THE HISTORY OF

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:21.824
LEADERSHIP- THAT THIS ENTIRE

02:53:21.891 --> 02:53:23.793
COMMITTEE BENEFITS FROM. THE

02:53:23.860 --> 02:53:25.762
TWEEN YOU AND FORMER SECRETARY

02:53:25.828 --> 02:53:28.030
LAYERED HERE WE'VE GOT. GOOD

02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:29.866
KNOWLEDGE BUILT TO BUILD ON WE

02:53:29.932 --> 02:53:30.633
STILL HAVEN'T MADE PROGRESS TO

02:53:30.700 --> 02:53:33.402
YOUR POINT- DR HAWKING BRIDGER.

02:53:33.469 --> 02:53:36.272
IS THE NEW CASEY ANY QUICK

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:39.275
FEEDBACK OR COMMENTS. TO THE

02:53:39.342 --> 02:53:44.847
MAJORITY LEADER'S. CHARGE. I

02:53:44.914 --> 02:53:46.415
CAN GO FIRST KATE OR DATE WOULD

02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:50.753
YOU LIKE TO LOGO OKAY I- I WANT

02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:54.390
TO- I THINK- CENTER HERZBERG

02:53:54.457 --> 02:53:57.059
FOR HIS COMMENTS I THINK THAT-

02:53:57.126 --> 02:53:58.795
YOU KNOW THAT ADDING TO THE

02:53:58.861 --> 02:54:02.031
TOOLS TOOL CHEST OF- STATE

02:54:02.098 --> 02:54:04.700
AGENCIES- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

02:54:04.767 --> 02:54:06.836
FROM ALL DIFFERENT SIDES- IS

02:54:06.903 --> 02:54:09.172
THE BEST APPROACH BECAUSE WHAT

02:54:09.238 --> 02:54:11.107
A ONE SIZE FITS ALL MAY NOT

02:54:11.174 --> 02:54:13.376
WORK- FOR EVERY SINGLE STATE

02:54:13.442 --> 02:54:15.111
FORMER STATE LEASE OR OR EVEN

02:54:15.178 --> 02:54:17.113
IN THE FEDERAL WATERS I WILL

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:19.115
SAY THAT- YOUR BILL A COUPLE

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:21.884
YEARS AGO WHICH- REQUIRES CAL

02:54:21.951 --> 02:54:23.753
JAM TO UPDATE ITS FUNDING

02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.955
REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFSHORE-

02:54:26.022 --> 02:54:29.425
OPERATIONS- IS SUCH A TOOL AND-

02:54:29.492 --> 02:54:31.160
WE ENJOYED WORKING WITH CAL JAM

02:54:31.227 --> 02:54:32.962
ON- SOME OF THE INITIAL

02:54:33.029 --> 02:54:34.964
RESEARCH THAT. WAS CONDUCTED AS

02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:37.200
PART OF THAT WE ALSO THINK

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:40.336
THAT- AT EXPLORING THE END

02:54:40.403 --> 02:54:45.708
BRAINSTORMING ABOUT INCENTIVES-

02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:48.010
TO HELP. I AND- WHILE I'M- AND

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:49.946
MAKING RIGHT DECISIONS IT IS

02:54:50.012 --> 02:54:51.681
ALSO A GOOD APPROACH AS WELL

02:54:51.747 --> 02:54:54.150
SO- WITH THAT WHAT WHAT CAN I

02:54:54.217 --> 02:54:55.218
DO WANT TO JUST ADD ONE

02:54:55.284 --> 02:54:59.021
CLARIFICATION- WE DID HAVE

02:54:59.088 --> 02:55:00.590
RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATION

02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:02.091
RECENTLY A FIFTY MILLION

02:55:02.158 --> 02:55:03.359
DOLLARS IT ESCAPE MY HAVE

02:55:03.426 --> 02:55:05.294
MINDED I'M APOLOGIZE FOR THAT

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:06.596
FOUR PLATFORM HOLLY AND THAT

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:09.165
WAS- DUE TO THE INCREASED COSTS

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:10.366
ASSOCIATE WITH THE PRATT- WITH

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:12.101
THE PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:16.405
PURSUING LEGAL. REMEDIES

02:55:16.472 --> 02:55:19.709
AGAINST THE TRUSTEE. I DON'T

02:55:19.775 --> 02:55:21.744
HAVE MUCH TO ADD- MS LOOK HAS

02:55:21.811 --> 02:55:23.346
HE JUST JUST TO SAY THAT I

02:55:23.412 --> 02:55:25.248
THINK WE NEED TO BE WORKING AND

02:55:25.314 --> 02:55:26.515
PUSHING OUR FEDERAL COLLEAGUES

02:55:26.582 --> 02:55:28.451
AS WELL TO MOVE DECOMMISSIONED

02:55:28.517 --> 02:55:29.619
FORWARD THERE THERE'S

02:55:29.685 --> 02:55:32.088
CURRENTLY- THEY'RE WORKING ON

02:55:32.154 --> 02:55:34.790
A- PROGRAMMATIC III ASKED FOR

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:36.158
DECOMMISSIONING AND WE NEED TO

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:37.560
BE. PUSHING THAT FORWARD AS

02:55:37.627 --> 02:55:40.963
MUCH AS WE CAN- AND WILL BE

02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:43.900
WORKING TO DO SO- THANKS FOR

02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:44.934
THAT I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE IN

02:55:45.001 --> 02:55:46.402
THAT IN THAT SAME VEIN THE

02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:48.337
GOVERNOR I BELIEVE DID PROPOSE

02:55:48.404 --> 02:55:50.339
A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR-

02:55:50.406 --> 02:55:51.807
WELL REMEDIATION FUND IN THE

02:55:51.874 --> 02:55:55.211
BUDGET LAST YEAR- THE-

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:59.015
LEGISLATURE DID NOT- C. A. THE

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:01.550
CD THAT REQUEST AND- THAT. THAT

02:56:01.617 --> 02:56:04.220
ITEM HAS BEEN PULLED OVER- SO

02:56:04.287 --> 02:56:06.188
THAT MAY BE AN AREA TO LOOK

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:08.291
INTO HOWEVER I DO KNOW THAT

02:56:08.357 --> 02:56:09.558
THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED.

02:56:09.625 --> 02:56:11.594
ABOUT SIMPLY PUTTING UP FRONT

02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:13.729
PUBLIC DOLLARS IN PLACE- EVEN

02:56:13.796 --> 02:56:15.031
IF THOSE FUNDS MAYBE WERE TO BE

02:56:15.097 --> 02:56:16.365
MATCHED BY FEDERAL FUNDING

02:56:16.432 --> 02:56:17.500
WHICH APPEARS TO BE IN THE

02:56:17.566 --> 02:56:19.135
BUILD BACK BETTER PLANNED. A

02:56:19.201 --> 02:56:20.136
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR

02:56:20.202 --> 02:56:22.772
REMEDIATION FUND- WITH THE SORT

02:56:22.838 --> 02:56:24.507
OF MATCHING COMPONENT I THINK

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:25.841
THAT THE MISSING PIECE HERE IS

02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:27.109
WHAT. WHAT WILL THE OIL

02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:29.278
INDUSTRY'S PEACE BE- IT FEELS

02:56:29.345 --> 02:56:30.880
LIKE THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

02:56:30.947 --> 02:56:31.480
GOVERNMENT ARE WILLING TO COME

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.716
TO THE TABLE BUT- HOPEFULLY IN

02:56:33.783 --> 02:56:34.917
THESE MORE COMPREHENSIVE

02:56:34.984 --> 02:56:36.852
DISCUSSIONS WE CAN. START TO

02:56:36.919 --> 02:56:38.621
CHART THAT PATH AND FIND A WAY

02:56:38.688 --> 02:56:40.556
THROUGH THIS- SENATOR MEN DID

02:56:40.623 --> 02:56:42.458
YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:42.925
THERE YEAH I HAD A FEW

02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:45.394
QUESTIONS- SO I SAID FROM THE

02:56:45.461 --> 02:56:46.362
DECOMMISSIONING I WAS JUST

02:56:46.429 --> 02:56:48.164
CURIOUS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE

02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:51.334
STATE'S POWERS- OVER PIPES THAT

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.569
CAME INTO STATE WATERS. AND I

02:56:53.636 --> 02:56:56.439
KNOW THAT- I BELIEVE IT'S NOW

02:56:56.505 --> 02:56:58.641
LIKE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT-

02:56:58.708 --> 02:57:00.576
THE- HEIGHT BEING MAY HAVE BEEN

02:57:00.643 --> 02:57:02.611
AN ISSUE THAT. IS NOT CLEAR

02:57:02.678 --> 02:57:03.913
WHEN THE PIPING WAS LAST

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:05.314
INSPECTED AND I GUESS MAYBE

02:57:05.381 --> 02:57:06.282
THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO

02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:08.684
WE KNOW. WHEN THE PIPING WAS

02:57:08.751 --> 02:57:10.686
LAST INSPECTED OR REPLACED-

02:57:10.753 --> 02:57:12.355
WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE LIFETIME

02:57:12.421 --> 02:57:13.522
OF A FIGHT LIKE THIS AND I

02:57:13.589 --> 02:57:14.957
REALIZE THAT. THIS MAY HAVE

02:57:15.024 --> 02:57:16.292
OCCURRED FROM AN ANCHOR

02:57:16.359 --> 02:57:17.827
DRAGGING ALONG THE OCEAN FLOOR

02:57:17.893 --> 02:57:19.895
BUT I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN

02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:20.696
NINETY NINE SPILL IN HUNTINGTON

02:57:20.763 --> 02:57:23.466
BEACH. WAS DUE TO AGING PIPES

02:57:23.532 --> 02:57:25.034
AND I'M JUST AS I WE START TO

02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:26.335
THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST

02:57:26.402 --> 02:57:28.137
OF THE STUFF WAS BUILT IN

02:57:28.204 --> 02:57:28.738
NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN

02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:30.940
SEVENTIES. I THINK I'D BE GOOD

02:57:31.007 --> 02:57:32.208
TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS HAS

02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:33.809
BEEN UPDATED HOW REGULARLY IT

02:57:33.876 --> 02:57:35.745
IS REFURBISHED OR FIXED OR

02:57:35.811 --> 02:57:37.413
WHATEVER THE CORRECT TERM IS-

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.215
AND WHAT LEVERS WE AS A STATE

02:57:39.281 --> 02:57:40.683
HAVE TO OVERSEE THAT A

02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:43.119
REQUIREMENT- SINCE- YOU KNOW

02:57:43.185 --> 02:57:44.320
I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE

02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:46.856
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- ENDING

02:57:46.922 --> 02:57:53.262
OFFSHORE DRILLING ANYTIME. SOON.

02:57:53.329 --> 02:57:53.829
WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE

02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:54.430
STATEMENT. AT A CERTAIN SO I

02:57:54.497 --> 02:57:56.032
CAN I CAN- ADDRESS THAT FIRST

02:57:56.098 --> 02:57:58.200
THEN TURN IT OVER TO DR VOCAL

02:57:58.267 --> 02:58:00.970
RANGE AND- WELL THE STATE LANDS

02:58:01.037 --> 02:58:04.540
COMMISSION- MANAGES LEASES- FOR

02:58:04.607 --> 02:58:06.809
PIPELINES WITHIN STATE WATERS-

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:08.310
WE ARE NOT THAT A PIPELINE

02:58:08.377 --> 02:58:10.713
REGULATORY AGENCY THAT IT DOES

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:12.715
LIE WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND

02:58:12.782 --> 02:58:13.983
CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES ALSO

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:15.918
LIVE WITH CAL JAM. SO SAY WITH

02:58:15.985 --> 02:58:18.354

THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO A

03:03:48.283 --> 03:03:50.619
COMPLEX AREA OF THE LAW THAT-

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:52.521
BECAUSE THESE ARE FEDERAL-

03:03:52.588 --> 03:03:54.289
THESE ARE PIPELINES THAT SERVE

03:03:54.356 --> 03:03:56.492
FEDERAL OPERATIONS WE DO HAVE

03:03:56.558 --> 03:03:59.061

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE

03:04:08.737 --> 03:04:11.240
PREEMPTION AUTHORITY- NOW THAT

03:04:11.306 --> 03:04:13.809
DOESN'T ISN'T THE PRIMARY.

03:04:13.876 --> 03:04:15.411
FOCUS OF THE COMMISSION BUT IT

03:04:15.477 --> 03:04:17.279
IS SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERATE

03:04:17.346 --> 03:04:19.782
OF AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE

03:04:19.848 --> 03:04:22.351
AND- HOW TO STRUCTURE THE LEGAL

03:04:22.418 --> 03:04:24.453
AND POLICY RAMEWORK FOR MOVING

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:25.354
FORWARD TO ACHIEVE OUR POLICY

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:27.856
GOALS NOT SHIPPING OUT IT IS

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:29.091
VERY HELPFUL AND SO SHIFTING I

03:04:29.158 --> 03:04:33.529
GUESS TO THE ACTUAL. PLATFORMS-

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:34.630
AND THE LEASES- EIGHT EIGHT I

03:04:34.696 --> 03:04:35.864
KNOW THAT IT'S CAL JAM THAT HAS

03:04:35.931 --> 03:04:37.599
THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THE

03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.101
PERMITS ON NEW DRILLING OR

03:04:39.168 --> 03:04:40.702
EXTRACTION. AND WE DON'T

03:04:40.769 --> 03:04:41.737
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:43.005
REPRESENTED FROM CAL JAM HERE

03:04:43.071 --> 03:04:44.773
BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER

03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:46.375
TO THIS- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

03:04:46.442 --> 03:04:50.078
WHICH IS THE- WHEN. IT SO AS

03:04:50.145 --> 03:04:51.413
YOU KNOW I BELIEVE YOU AND I

03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:52.781
DISCUSSED I I'D LIKE TO

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:54.516
INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ENDING

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:55.517
DRILLING AND EXTRACTION

03:04:55.584 --> 03:04:57.286
INCLUDING UNDER EXISTING LEASES

03:04:57.352 --> 03:04:58.420
AND THAT IS THE MAJORITY LEADER

03:04:58.487 --> 03:05:00.155
REFERRED TO. DOES RUN IN THE

03:05:00.222 --> 03:05:02.257
EMINENT DOMAIN TAKINGS ISSUE.

03:05:02.324 --> 03:05:03.792
NOW SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE

03:05:03.859 --> 03:05:04.827
COULD DO THE SAME THING

03:05:04.893 --> 03:05:07.129
THROUGH- ENDING PERMITS-

03:05:07.196 --> 03:05:09.198
REMOVING PERMITS AND I WAS

03:05:09.264 --> 03:05:10.599
WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO

03:05:10.666 --> 03:05:11.934
WHAT CAL JAM HAS TO CONSIDER

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:13.435
EITHER FROM A STATUTORY.

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:15.404
PERSPECTIVE OR A CONTRACTUAL

03:05:15.471 --> 03:05:17.473
PERSPECTIVE IN DECIDING WHETHER

03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:19.208
OR NOT TO ISSUE NEW PERMITS

03:05:19.274 --> 03:05:22.544
UNDER THE LEASE IS THAT IT HAS

03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:24.446
THESE EXISTING LEASES. I WISH I

03:05:24.513 --> 03:05:25.447
COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:05:25.514 --> 03:05:27.916
HELPFUL IN ANSWERING THIS I AM

03:05:27.983 --> 03:05:30.185
NOT AN EXPERT ON CAL JAM

03:05:30.252 --> 03:05:31.186
STATUTORY AND REGULATORY

03:05:31.253 --> 03:05:34.823

03:06:02.618 --> 03:06:04.286
THOSE REGULATIONS EVOLVE AND

03:06:04.353 --> 03:06:05.754
CHANGE AND BECOME MORE

03:06:05.821 --> 03:06:08.123
PROTECTIVE. THAT OPERATORS ARE

LEASES WHICH ARE STUCK IN THE

REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS AND

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:29.678
AUTHORITIES. THE LAST HOUR

03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:32.648
OPERATORS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO

03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:33.382
MEET THOSE EVOLVING

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:35.350

PERMIT FOR NEW DRILLING UNDER

03:06:45.494 --> 03:06:46.295
EXISTING LEASE. I CAN'T ANSWER

03:06:46.361 --> 03:06:47.796
THAT THAT IS REALLY UNDER THE

03:06:47.863 --> 03:06:49.865
GUISE OF CAL JAM AND THEIR

03:06:49.932 --> 03:06:51.166
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR

03:06:51.233 --> 03:06:53.068
LEGAL AUTHORITIES GOT IT I

03:06:53.135 --> 03:06:57.005
APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MUCH.

03:06:57.072 --> 03:06:58.640
OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MAN A

03:06:58.707 --> 03:07:01.176
SIMILAR. I'LL JUST BE

03:07:01.243 --> 03:07:03.679
RELATIVELY BRIEF- BECAUSE I

03:07:03.745 --> 03:07:07.182
THINK SENATOR MAN EXHAUSTIVELY

03:07:07.249 --> 03:07:09.017
WENT INTO THE ISSUE AND IF WE

03:07:09.084 --> 03:07:10.485
WERE REALLY GOING TO MOVE INTO

03:07:10.552 --> 03:07:12.120
SOME OF THESE AREAS OF OIL

03:07:12.187 --> 03:07:14.723
POLICY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:07:14.790 --> 03:07:18.827
UNDERSTAND REGULATORY STATUTORY

03:07:18.894 --> 03:07:20.862
OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF FEDERAL

03:07:20.929 --> 03:07:23.165
EMINENT DOMAIN AND THERE'S SO

03:07:23.231 --> 03:07:26.268
MUCH AS THE PERSON. THAT WAS

03:07:26.335 --> 03:07:27.536
THE SUPERVISOR OF THE

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:30.105
PREDECESSOR AGENCY OF CAL JAM

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:32.741
FOR EIGHT YEARS IT IS EXACTLY

03:07:32.808 --> 03:07:35.410
R. A FACT FINDING LEVEL BEFORE

03:07:35.477 --> 03:07:36.478
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLICY

03:07:36.545 --> 03:07:38.914
LEVEL IT IT SO IT WOULD REALLY

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:40.716
DO THAT AND THEN I'M SORRY

03:07:40.782 --> 03:07:43.051
SENATOR HERTZBERG LAST I HAD

03:07:43.118 --> 03:07:43.819
JUST HAD ONE COMMENT ON HIS

03:07:43.885 --> 03:07:46.488
COMMENTS. AND THAT IS A SINCE

03:07:46.555 --> 03:07:48.056
IT MIGHT BE A WHILE SOMETHING

03:07:48.123 --> 03:07:50.425
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE CONSIDERS I

03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:52.527
STARTED TO VET THE NOTION OF

03:07:52.594 --> 03:07:55.397
DOING- RIGS TO REEFS BILL WHEN

03:07:55.464 --> 03:07:57.299
I WAS IN MY LAST YEAR IN THE

03:07:57.366 --> 03:07:59.635
ASSEMBLY. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS

03:07:59.701 --> 03:08:01.770
A SIMPLE CONCEPT THAT NO

03:08:01.837 --> 03:08:05.207
LIABILITY IS RELEASED OF THE

03:08:05.273 --> 03:08:07.142
OIL COMPANY AND DOING IT THAT

03:08:07.209 --> 03:08:09.077
THE REQUIRED TO CAP AND CLOSE

03:08:09.144 --> 03:08:10.545
OFF THE WELL BECAUSE THEY WOULD

03:08:10.612 --> 03:08:13.715
BE AS IF THE RIG WAS A 100%

03:08:13.782 --> 03:08:15.951
BEING RENEWED. AND THAT YOU

03:08:16.018 --> 03:08:18.253
WOULD TAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN

03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:22.324
REVENUE- FOR BENEFIT AND ON A

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:24.726
100% BASIS MOVING TO OCEANS

03:08:24.793 --> 03:08:26.895
PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:29.631
MOVED TO BACKING ORPHAN WELLS-

03:08:29.698 --> 03:08:31.500
OR OTHER COSTS IN THE FIELD.

03:08:31.566 --> 03:08:34.569
AND IF THAT SEEMED SIMPLE BUT

03:08:34.636 --> 03:08:36.838
TO ME AND THE ISSUE WAS BETWEEN

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:39.374
THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS IS IF

03:08:39.441 --> 03:08:40.976
SOMEBODY WAS ATTEMPTING IT

03:08:41.043 --> 03:08:48.150
AGAIN I MEAN. A CENTER.

03:08:48.216 --> 03:08:48.750
HERZBERG ALLOWED AS TO HOW IT

03:08:48.817 --> 03:08:49.351
FAILED. IT FAILED BECAUSE IT

03:08:49.418 --> 03:08:49.985
WAS SUCH A LACK OF TRUST IN OUR

03:08:50.052 --> 03:08:50.786
WOULD SAY JIM THERE. BETWEEN

03:08:50.852 --> 03:08:53.288
MORE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

03:08:53.355 --> 03:08:55.691
ORGANIZATIONS AND GENERICALLY

03:08:55.757 --> 03:08:57.959
MORE OIL PRODUCING COMPANIES ON

03:08:58.026 --> 03:08:59.528
THE BELIEF THAT SHOULD GET MOST

03:08:59.594 --> 03:09:01.430
OF THE WAY IN THERE. AND THEN

03:09:01.496 --> 03:09:02.931
THERE WOULD BE THIS COMPROMISE

03:09:02.998 --> 03:09:04.933
TO DATE ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.035
470% OF THE MONEY THAT THEY

03:09:07.102 --> 03:09:08.937
WERE OTHERWISE AND IN THE END.

03:09:09.004 --> 03:09:11.773
THEY WOULD BE GIVEN SOME RIDE

03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:13.809
THAT WOULD'VE EXISTED IF THEY

03:09:13.875 --> 03:09:16.278
WENT THROUGH EXISTING TO A

03:09:16.344 --> 03:09:17.345
CLOSE AND DECOMMISSION THE

03:09:17.412 --> 03:09:19.881
WELLS. A. N. THERE WAS A

03:09:19.948 --> 03:09:21.650
CONCERN THAT I DIDN'T THINK WAS

03:09:21.717 --> 03:09:23.085
FELT THAT SOMEHOW IN THE

03:09:23.151 --> 03:09:24.519
PROCESS THEY WOULD BE RELEASED

03:09:24.586 --> 03:09:26.988
FROM LIABILITY AS WELL. AND SO

03:09:27.055 --> 03:09:30.025
IF THERE IS A SERIOUS INTENT OF

03:09:30.092 --> 03:09:32.494
DOING THIS BY SOMEBODY. I THINK

03:09:32.561 --> 03:09:34.229
THOSE ARE THE MOVING PIECES

03:09:34.296 --> 03:09:36.064
THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED A

03:09:36.131 --> 03:09:37.599
LACK OF TRUST BUT IT WOULDN'T

03:09:37.666 --> 03:09:39.501
REALLY GET BELOW A 100% THERE'S

03:09:39.568 --> 03:09:41.236
NOT A RELEASE OF LIABILITY AS

03:09:41.303 --> 03:09:42.671
PART OF IT. AND THEN

03:09:42.738 --> 03:09:44.239
POTENTIALLY YOU COULD GET THERE

03:09:44.306 --> 03:09:47.542
BUT I THINK. THE IT. IT IT IN A

03:09:47.609 --> 03:09:48.777
SUNBURN HURTS BERG WENT RIGHT

03:09:48.844 --> 03:09:50.545
UP TO THAT AND I THINK THAT IS

03:09:50.612 --> 03:09:52.748
THE NEXT DISCUSSION. AND THOSE

03:09:52.814 --> 03:09:53.815
ARE THE FACTS BETWEEN THE

03:09:53.882 --> 03:09:55.617
STAKEHOLDERS AND SO I JUST

03:09:55.684 --> 03:09:56.918
THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION IT SO

03:09:56.985 --> 03:09:59.154
THAT. IF ANYBODY IS CONSIDERING

03:09:59.221 --> 03:10:02.224
IT DOES OR WHAT YOU'D YOU'D

03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:04.960
HAVE TO DO SO. I APPRECIATE THE

03:10:05.026 --> 03:10:10.632
TESTIMONY OF THE- DIRECTOR. OF

03:10:10.699 --> 03:10:11.166
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION

03:10:11.233 --> 03:10:12.634
BECAUSE- DID. IS THERE SUCH A

03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:14.236
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WELLS

03:10:14.302 --> 03:10:16.271
SAUNDERS ARE 100% RESPONSIBLE

03:10:16.338 --> 03:10:18.173
PARTY SOME THERE'S THIS MASSIVE

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:21.076
COST SOME THERE'S A SMALL COST.

03:10:21.143 --> 03:10:22.477
SOME SOMEBODY'S JUST WALKED

03:10:22.544 --> 03:10:25.080
AWAY FROM AND- IT IS ALWAYS

03:10:25.147 --> 03:10:27.516

AND I THINK THAT'LL BE THE

03:10:35.690 --> 03:10:37.159
CHALLENGE AND IN CRAFTING

03:10:37.225 --> 03:10:39.327

TALKED ABOUT HERE AND HOW THAT

03:11:55.837 --> 03:11:57.906
MATCHES UP AGAINST THE

03:11:57.973 --> 03:12:00.242
COMBINATION OF BONDING AND

03:12:00.308 --> 03:12:02.844

DECISIONS OF THE PARTICULAR

03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:28.336
OPERATOR- IS THAT SOMETHING

03:12:28.403 --> 03:12:30.038
THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE THE

COMMITTEE I KNOW A LOT OF THIS

03:12:31.172 --> 03:12:33.041
IS EXISTING WORK YOU'VE GOT ON

03:12:33.108 --> 03:12:34.643
YOUR WEBSITE BUT JUST TO BE

03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:36.578

ADMINISTRATION FOR SOME OF THE

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:45.253
OTHER ITEMS. CERTAINLY WE'D BE

03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:48.290
HAPPY TO DO THAT OKAY GREAT-

03:12:48.356 --> 03:12:49.324
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR

03:12:49.391 --> 03:12:50.525
WORK GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I DO

03:12:50.592 --> 03:12:51.960
THINK WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO.

03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:53.161
BE GETTING INTO DETAILS AND

WE DO NEED TO GET THE PUBLIC

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:14.749
