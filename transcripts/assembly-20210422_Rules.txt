WHO WERE SYSTEMICALLY KILLED AT THE HANDS OF THE TURKISH OTTOMAN EMPIRE- THEN THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY- OF THE THREE MILLION MORE THAN HALF WERE ETHNIC ARMENIANS THE REMAINDER WERE OTHER INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WHETHER GREEKS ASSYRIANS YEZIDIS. THANK YOU UP FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN STATEMENTS OF DENIAL OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WHICH THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE HAVEN'T TOURED SINCE. NINETEEN FIFTEEN. SOMETHING MISTER RAMOS IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS AND SO IS MR LEVINE. UNTIL TODAY THE LEADERS OF TURKEY DENYING THAT THE GENOCIDE EVER TOOK PLACE AND YOU WILL HEAR SUCH TESTIMONY IN THIS ROOM SHORTLY. THEY CONTINUE TO USE RHETORIC THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAST BY ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THE TRUTH. PROPER RECOGNITION OF GENOCIDE HELPS PREVENT FUTURE GENOCIDES. SILENCE IN THE FACE OF THE NILE EMBOLDENS THOSE WHO WOULD COMMIT GENOCIDE IN THE FUTURE. AND PROMOTES IMPUNITY AND CULTURES OF BIGOTRY. OFFENDERS OF SUBSEQUENT CRIMES HAVE BEEN EMBOLDENED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S FAILURE TO CONFRONT GENOCIDE. THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT ONLY A MORAL OBLIGATION BUT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO RECOGNIZE AND TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER NAZARIAN ARE THERE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
