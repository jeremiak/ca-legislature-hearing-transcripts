CAN IMPROVE ACCESS ESPECIALLY

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:03.942
FOR UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS WE

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:05.510
KNOW THAT THAT ACCESS TO

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.047
JUSTICE IS BEEN A KEY ISSUE WE

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:11.516

ACTUALLY. BE SYNONYMOUS WITH

GOAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.724

CALIFORNIANS IT'S TWO POINT ONE

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.258

AS THEY GO AS THEY- INDIVIDUALS

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.331

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:13.671
EMPLOYMENT WERE THE MOST COMMON

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.306
TYPES OF LEGAL PROBLEMS

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:18.509
FAMILIES EXPERIENCED. SO THEY

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:19.109
HAD MORE OF THOSE IN TERMS OF

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:21.912
FREQUENCY. NOW REGARDLESS OF

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.247
THE PROBLEMS THAT FAMILIES

TAT THE ISSUE MAY HAVE A CIVIL

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:43.500
LEGAL REMEDY. OR THAT THEY NEED

INFORMATION. SECONDLY BASED ON

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.340

LEGAL AID CAN ONLY FULLY

PROBLEMS THAT COME TO THEIR

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.213
DOOR. BASED ON A LACK OF

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.482
RESOURCES ALONG WITH STAFFING

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:00.885
AND OTHER CHALLENGES ONE THIRD

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:03.254
THEY CAN EVEN EVEN HELP AT ALL.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.321
ONE THIRD THE CAN PARTIALLY

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.323
SERVE ABOUT ONE THIRD THEY CAN

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.492
FULLY RESERVE SERVE. WE SEE

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.461
THAT ONE THIRD OF LEGAL AID

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:11.996
ATTORNEYS ARE LEAVING THE

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.964
ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS.

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:17.067
FINANCIAL SALARIES ARE THE

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:17.635
NUMBER ONE REASON FINANCIAL

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:20.504
STRUCTURES. WHICH LEADS INTO

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:23.107
THE BLAST FINDING WHICH IS 80%

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.808
OF ALL AB A CALIFORNIA LAW

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.610

THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LAW SCHOOL

00:42:30.447 --> 00:42:32.116
DEBT. THAT'S A MEDIAN SO HALF

00:42:32.182 --> 00:42:33.851
WILL HAVE MORE THAN THAT AND

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.920
HALF WILL HAVE LESS THAN THAT.

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:37.421
MOVING INTO WHAT DOES THE

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.390
JUSTICE GAP LOOK LIKE AT THE

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:41.358
JUSTICE GAP AS WE DEFINE IT.

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.626
ART WHAT ARE THE CIVIL LEGAL

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:43.794
PROBLEMS THAT LOW AND MODERATE

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:46.130
INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:46.730
AND WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE TO

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.766
MEET THOSE NEEDS. THE LEFT FOR

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:51.535
SHOWS THE GAP FOR LOW INCOME

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:53.137
CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFY FOR

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:54.905
FREE LEGAL SERVICES AT ABOUT

EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. WHAT I

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.608
WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.276
NOTICE IS THAT THIS GAP PROCESS

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.378
THAT IS HIGHER FOR EVEN INCOMES

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:05.582
UP 23100% OF POVERTY. BUT IS

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:06.216
ACTUALLY PROCESS REGARDLESS OF

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.595
WE ASK THEM ALL WANTING TO SEEK

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.264
LEGAL HELP IT GOES TO THE MANY

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.633
QUESTIONS THAT- PEOPLE HAVE

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.868
ALREADY OFFERED AMONG THIS

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:25.502
COMMITTEE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.072
THE LEGAL ISSUE. FOR MANY

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:28.706
PROBLEMS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.741
THE LEGAL ISSUE. LIKE DR WEBER

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.976
SAID PEOPLE JUST ARE DEALING IT

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.877
WITH ALL ON THEIR OWN. BUT HAD

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.446

RAMIFICATIONS THEY MAY HAVE

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.182
BEHAVED DIFFERENTLY. THE ALSO

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:39.183
THE ISSUES OF NOT KNOWING WHERE

LITIGATION IS ALSO. A FACTOR. I

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:48.592
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:49.660
COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND IN

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.695

THE POSSIBLE AVENUES THEY CAN

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:16.854
TAKE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.856
WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.290
PROBLEMS CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:22.292
ACTUALLY SEEKING LEGAL HELP

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.861
AGAIN THIS IS ONLY THE ONE IN

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:24.928
THREE THAT REALLY EVEN SEEKING

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.263
LEGAL HELP AND THEN RECEIVING

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.698
LEGAL HELP WE SEE A SLIGHT

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:31.802
SHIFT IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOR-

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.237
THESE ARE CATEGORIES IN WHICH

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.438
CALIFORNIANS WILL ACTUALLY

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.073
STATE THESE PROBLEMS HAVE A

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.741
SUBSTANTIAL OR SEVERE IMPACT ON

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:41.145
THEIR LIVES. CUSTODY FAMILY LAW

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:44.715
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IMMIGRATION AND

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.250
SO THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO NOT

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.551
ONLY THINK LEGAL SERVICES BUT

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.653
ALSO RECEIVE THEM BUT AT THE

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.821
SAME TIME THESE ARE ALSO THE

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:52.656
SAME CATEGORIES IN WHICH MOST

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:53.223
PEOPLE THINK I NEED A LAWYER

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.093
FOR THAT. SO THAT GOES THE

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.395
KNOWLEDGE GAP. THE LAST MY LAST

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:01.565
SLIDE IS BASED ON- WHAT ARE THE

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:02.699
SOURCES OF HELP FOR

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:05.002
CALIFORNIANS. YOU WILL SEE FOR

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.870
MOST CALIFORNIANS NOT THE MOST

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.605
I WOULD SAY. FOR CALIFORNIANS

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:11.308
OVERALL A PAID ATTORNEY IS THE

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:14.078
NUMBER ONE AVENUE HOWEVER. YOU

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:15.679
DON'T KNOW THE AVERAGE COST OF

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:16.880
THE HOURLY RATE FOR ATTORNEY

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:19.483
CALIFORNIA IS THREE HUNDRED AND

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.052
TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:24.154
IF WE LOOK AT FOR LOW INCOME

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.023
FAMILIES THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.225
OF HELP IS LEGAL AID AND WHEN

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:29.560
WE LOOK AT THE FLOODED WE SEE

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.095
LEGAL AID WITH OTHER NONPROFITS

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:32.362
AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:34.531
LIKE THE COURTS. THEY MAKE UP

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.800
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.602
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:40.971
CALIFORNIANS OVERALL. SO FOR

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:43.107
NEXT STEPS OF THE STATE BAR IS

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.475
ACTUALLY CONDUCTING PHASE TWO

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.376
OF THE JUSTICE GAP STUDY. TO

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:40.137
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THESE

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:41.905
DECISIONS ARE LIKE WALDRON TO

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:43.807
THE FAMILY UNIT. I'M NOT JUST

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.342
THE LITTLE DISRUPTION. I

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:46.543
BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENTIAL

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.412
NATURE OF THESE ISSUES IS BEEN

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:50.113
FIT BUT IN FAMILY LAW. A

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.249
JUDGE'S PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:54.084
ANY SORT. AND IT'S BECAUSE THE

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.786
FAMILY LAW JUDGES VESTED WITH

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.621
VAST DISCUSSION. GIVEN THE

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:58.922
MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

00:50:58.989 --> 00:50:59.990
ARE DEALING WITH YOU WOULD ASK

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.625
YOURSELF WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:04.127
TO SELF REPRESENT. OBVIOUSLY

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:06.263
THE OFFICE ON FIFTY THING TO BE

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.732
REAL PROCEED COST- MY COLLEAGUE

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.267
HAS SPOKEN AFTER THAT. AND THEN

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.935
AS THE PERCEPTION THAT THE

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.271
COURT WILL DO THE RIGHT THING A

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.006

INDIGENT SUBJECT TO BE WITH US.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.920
THAT COMPLICATED. IT MAY BE A

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:30.687
GENERAL MISTRUST OF THE LEGAL

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:33.256
SYSTEM. AND THEN WE ALSO CITE

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.658
THIS TREND TOWARD SELF HELP.

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.226
THERE'S ALWAYS A YOU TUBE VIDEO

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:37.894

THE POINTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.814
TO THEM. THEIR PRIME CONCERN IS

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.549

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:32.462
DIFFERENCE. I'VE SEEN TIENEN

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.631

THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.903
DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY'S FEES WHEN

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:05.395
THOUSAND AND SIX- AND I THINK

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.162

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:08.765

DISCOVERED THAT THE HUSBAND HAD

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.203
MOLESTED THEIR YOUNGEST CHILD.

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:14.637

IMMEDIATELY BE SAFE. SHE MADE

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.384
SURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.719

SHE EVEN PAID THE RENT FOR AN

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:45.502

STAND WHILE SHE WAS IN THE

ACCEPT THE RENT AT THAT TIME.

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:39.923
AND SHE WENT TO TRIAL AND

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.558
BASICALLY SAID PLEASE LET ME

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:42.725

DEFENSE AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:52.635
CASE. SHE THEN LOST AND KAY AND

GONNA CALM AND THEY'RE GOING TO

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.779
AFFECT YOU. AND AT THAT POINT

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.047
LIKELY SHE CAME TO AN

AND THE NOTICES DEFECTIVE THIS

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.801
SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED BUT

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:26.369
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:27.303
LAWYER TO PREPARE HER

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.138
PAPERWORK. AND SHE HADN'T RAISE

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.173
THAT I COULDN'T EVEN APPEAL

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.374
BECAUSE IT HASN'T HADN'T BEEN

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.910
RAISED- AT THE TRIAL. AND IT

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:36.045
WASN'T IN THE ANSWER BUT WHAT I

SAYING THAT SHE WAS A GOOD

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:06.542
NEIGHBOR. AND THAT SHE WAS PART

00:59:06.609 --> 00:59:07.710
OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEY

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:08.311
WANTED HER TO BE ABLE TO COME

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.647
BACK. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:13.016
JUST TURNING TO SIGN A

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:19.889
DECLARATION SAYING HOW. ON HOW

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:22.458
HARD SHE HAD WORK TO PROTECT

FAMILY AND- ATTACKED THE

00:59:24.661 --> 00:59:26.829
VICTIMS OF A CRIME. IN THE

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.331
PROCESS OF ADMINISTERING BUT

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:34.237
JUST AS. AT THE MOTION GRANT.

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:34.771
THIS IS THE CASE THAT NAY

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:35.371
SHOULD HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO THE

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:36.306
POINT BUT I WILL NEVER BE LOST

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:38.374
ON ME WHEN THE MOTHER SAID WHY

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.710
IS IT MY HUSBAND HAD A PUBLIC

LAWYER. AND I DON'T HAVE AN

ANSWER FOR THAT EXCEPT I REALLY

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:51.888
HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:54.190
CHANGE REDDING CALIFORNIA AND

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.993
THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW THAT IN

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.861
THE FUTURE MOTHERS WILL ALWAYS

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.897
HAVE- THOSE PROTECTIONS AND

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:05.268
THAT REPRESENTATION. THANK YOU

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.570
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION SEVEN

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.706
WAYS BERGMAN THAT CAN ASK THESE

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:11.607
ARE THINGS THAT THAT WE SHOULD

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:12.842
HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO ARE WE

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.677
BETTER OFF FUNDING LEGAL

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.546
SERVICES ATTORNEYS WERE SELF

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:20.249
HELP CENTERS. AND WHY FEW ONE

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:21.951
OR THE OTHER NOT THAT THAT

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.086
WE'RE GOING TO NECESSARILY DO

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.188
THAT BUT- JUST TO HELP. TALK

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.723
ABOUT THE ISSUE I MEAN I WOULD

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:28.057
I WOULD I WOULD SAY IT SHOULD

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.826
ALWAYS BE. ALL OF THEM BUT I

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.527
THINK THAT THE GAME CHANGER IS

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.730
THAT REPRESENTATION I MEAN. I

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.698
KNOW FOR MYSELF- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:36.632
I DID A WILL I DIDN'T DO IT

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:38.601
MYSELF AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:41.337
I THINK THAT- IT IT IS THAT

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:44.173
REPRESENTATION. AND WE SEE THE-

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.341
YOU KNOW WITH PUBLIC DEFENDERS

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.477
AND STATES WHERE THERE ARE NO

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:48.311
ATTORNEYS I MEAN THE WHOLE

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.780
SYSTEM FALLS APART BECAUSE YOU

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:54.317
CAN'T. IF YOU DON'T HAVE. EVERY

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.818
PART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:58.154
PRESENT IT CAN'T FUNCTION IT'S

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.555
LIKE HAVE TRYING TO DRIVE A CAR

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:01.657
WITH ONLY THREE WHEELS. AND I

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.226
THINK THAT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:06.129
IN YOU KNOW. IN PLACE I DON'T I

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.296
DON'T WANT TO POINT OUT SOME

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.766
PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT WE HAVE

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.100
CERTAIN STEREOTYPES ABOUT BUT

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.969
YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST PLACES

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.238
WHERE TENANTS. VERY VISIBLE OR

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.272
THAT THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THREE

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.075
HOURS- TO ACCESS SERVICES

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:20.910
BECAUSE WE ARE SERVICES ARE SO

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.479
LIMITED. AND THE WAY THEY'RE

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:24.647
TREATED AND THE CONDITIONS THAT

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:25.715
PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE UNDER

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:29.585
REALLY- I JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.920
REMINDS ME OF THE GREAT.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:31.988
STARTED TAKING PICTURES OF HOW

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.189
PEOPLE REAL AND FOR THE FIRST

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.924
TIME. AT THE YOU KNOW WE PASSED

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.993
A WRITER HOUSING YOU KNOW AFTER

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:37.727
THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND WE

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.629
ADDRESS THAT WE ARE RETURN TO

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.364
THAT WAY I HAVE BEEN IN CLIENTS

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.433
HOMES THAT. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:46.002
TO LIVE THAT WAY BUT THEY CAN'T

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.303
FIGHT THEIR LANDLORDS BECAUSE

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.273
THEY THERE'S- A LAW. TO DO THAT

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.974
AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO NOW

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:57.914
THIS. AT TRIAL SOME AND LAW.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.249
SEE BECAUSE THEY BOTH CLIENTS

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.451
THOSE TEN ONE. GET HELP OR A-

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:02.418
AND NO KNOWS I MEAN PART OF IS

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:06.489
ALSO. KEEPING THE SYSTEM HONEST

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.557
BECAUSE SO MANY CASES ARE

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.859
SETTLED SO THE JUDGE IS NOT

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:13.863
EVEN SEEN KIND OF HOW THESE

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:14.464
THINGS ARE PLAYING OUT THEY'RE

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.131
NOT LOOKING AT THE NOTICE THEY

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.699
JUST HAVE TO PEOPLE THAT COME

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.568
AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.470
NEGOTIATING IN THE HALLWAY. AND

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:21.938
THEY JUST SIGN OFF AND THEY GET

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.607
CREDIT FOR NOT HAVING A

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.542
THOUSAND CASES GO TO TRIAL NOT

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.377
DID EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE WAS A

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:30.079
TRUST AND JUDGES AREN'T

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:31.347
SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER LAWYER

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.782
AT LEAST IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:35.017
SOME YEAH THEY CAN'T. PART OF

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.119
IT OUR SYSTEM IS AN ADVERSARIAL

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:37.487
SYSTEM WHICH PRESUMES THAT BOTH

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.021
SIDES ARE REPRESENTED AND

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.022
REPRESENT A COMPETENTLY THAT'S

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.958
THE ISSUE THAT IS WHY WE HAVE

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:43.326
THE STATE BAR AS WELL WE HAVE

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.260
LICENSING AND WE'RE TRYING TO

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.462
DO THAT. AND YET BECAUSE OF

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.664
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:50.500
INCREASED AND WE ARE ALLOWING

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.602
SELF HELP. CENTERS ARE. THE

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.737
STATE SHE SOMETIMES THE ONLY

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:57.940
WAY PEOPLE GET INTO COURT AND

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:58.508
HAVE ACCESS TO IT SO I THINK

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.743
THAT'S A- IT'S A TOUGH

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.311
SUBSTITUTE AND THOSE WERE THOSE

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.447
CENTERS DO AN AMAZING JOB OF

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.348
HELPING PEOPLE TRYING TO

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:06.449
PREPARE THEM. SO JUDGE WARNING

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:08.718
THAT. WE KNOW THAT

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.453
UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.455
FAMILY LAW IS STE THE SINGLE

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.526
BIGGEST. THAT THAT WE FIND THEM

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:17.527
DO YOU OR HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:20.630
IF YOU HAVE ONE PARTY THIS

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.197
REPRESENTED ONE PARTY THAT'S

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.399
NOT REPRESENTED. WHAT DOES THE

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.534
COMMON COMPLAINT THAT WE GET

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.201
FROM ATTORNEYS IS THAT THEY

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.802
THINK THE JUDGES BEEN TOO MUCH

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.970
OF AN ADVOCATE OR TRYING TO

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.438
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD TOO

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.741
MUCH FOR THE PROPUBLICA. BUT

01:03:31.807 --> 01:03:34.177
THERE ARE SOME PROCEDURAL. MINE

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:36.379
FIFTH PEOPLE OF THE PROPOSED.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.813
WILL FALL INTO. I THINK I'M

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.814
ALSO CHARGED WITH THE

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:40.349
RESPONSIBILITY OF MOVING THE

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.685
CASE ALONG. AND SO IT. ALTHOUGH

SOME WAYS THEY NEED TO BE

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.140
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.508
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO AND THEY

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.510
DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.611
SO THAT'S KIND OF A TOUGH.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.646
BUYING THAT. THE JUDGE OR IN

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.014

AN ADVOCATE IN A SYSTEM THAT

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.890
EXPECTS THAT ADVOCATE. AND

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.625
SOMEONE DOES. THAT ALMOST

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.893
EXACERBATES THE IT DOES

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.828

TO BE NEUTRAL SO THAT THE OTHER

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.373
SIDE THAT IS REPRESENTED IN.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.642
THE FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:40.977
DOLLAR RETAIN THE THINGS I PAY

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.045
FOR AN ATTORNEY AND THE JUDGE

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.146
IS HELPING THE OTHER THOUGHT.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:46.682
EVER SYSTEM. IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.150
ABOUT FAIRNESS AND I THINK

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:49.585
THAT'S WHY IN FAMILY LAW IN

01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:50.820

POTTED PLANT THE JUDGE IS MEANT

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.523
TO BE ACTIVE IN THE CASE

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:55.791
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.126
INVOLVED THE FACT THAT ONE

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:58.828
PARTY HAS REPRESENTATION

01:04:58.894 --> 01:04:59.795
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I SHOULD

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:00.930
OVERLOOKED THE PROCEDURE

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:03.666
DEFICITS ON THE REPRESENTATIVE

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.035
JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE HAS

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:07.670
MANAGED TO GAIN A PROCEDURAL

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.605
BONTA. YEAH RIGHTS OF A SONG

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.173
LOADED QUESTION BECAUSE WE'VE

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.742
BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:14.910
FOR A LONG TIME HOW DO WE GET A

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:18.214
TURN IN THE BAR TO PARTICIPATE

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:24.854
MORE IN FUNDING WILL. SO I THE

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.289
THAT WE'VE MAY. FAST IMPROVE.

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.224
THE MIX OF FUNDING FOR LEGAL

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.259

THAT REALLY MOST AFFECTS THEIR

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:28.083
LIVES. SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:42.965
PERSON SAID THAT THE JUDGE IS

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.399
ABLE TO NAY THE IF. AND MAKE

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:45.534
MORE OF A DECISION BASED ON THE

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.602
FACTS AND THE LAW RATHER THAN

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:49.104
ANY KIND PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS.

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:53.108

SHE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.749
IN IN SELF HELP NORMALLY WITH

01:17:00.816 --> 01:17:01.917
TENANTS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.585
WE'RE PROVIDING THEM AN ANSWER

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.954
AND BUYING THEM SOMETIME AND-

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:06.955
SAID THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.056
OPPORTUNITY POTENTIALLY TO TALK

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:10.459
THE LANDMARK BUT I WILL SAY

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:11.059
HAVING REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.829
FILES- FOR THE DRIVER

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:17.165
EVALUATION- WE DO A GREAT JOB

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.967
WITH THE PAPERWORK BUT

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:20.535

PEOPLE ON HELPING WITH. BUT I

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:31.246
THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:34.116
IS THAT'S AN AREA AT THAT AT

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:35.384
THAT TRIAL LEVEL PET SETTLEMENT

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.953
LEVEL WHERE I DO THINK

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:38.487
REPRESENTATION IS REALLY

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.722
FUNDAMENTAL. BUT WHAT YOU'D SEE

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:43.658
IN SELF HELP IS THAT- THAT

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.762
PERSON MAY HAVE LET ANOTHER

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.063
PERSON STAY IN THE HOME TO BE

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:50.032
ABLE. I'M SURE ROOM IN ORDER TO

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:54.236
MAKE IT SAYS. I DON'T IF THAT

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:56.071
PERSON DOES PAY. THAT PERSON IS

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.906
CONSIDERED A LAMB OR- SHE'S TO

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.307
HAVE TO FILE AN EVICTION ACTION

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.610
TO GET THAT PERSON OUT IF SHE

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:04.179
HAD A HOME AND THAT- SHE

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.214
BROUGHT SOMEBODY IN EITHER TO

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.229
MORE IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE HAVE

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:16.364

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:08.589
SIMPLY ASK THAT QUESTION

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:09.690
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:11.325
TIME I GO INTO A MEETING PEOPLE

01:32:11.392 --> 01:32:13.361
OF ALWAYS TELL ME WHERE WOULD

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:16.364
NOT- THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT I

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:17.999
DON'T AND I AND I RECOGNIZE

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:18.966
THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.835
FIRST OTHER PEOPLE SAY AND THIS

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:21.969
IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET TO WHERE

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:23.638
WE REALLY SHOULD BE WHAT WE CAN

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.072
ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE KIND OF

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:26.741
ACCESS THAT WE THINK IS

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:27.675
NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA. THE

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:29.877
STAFF AND- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.145
I'M CONSTANTLY PIECING TOGETHER

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.213
STUFF WITH ITS THERE'S A

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.614
WHETHER IT'S A WOMEN TALKING

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.883
ABOUT SHOP HERE IN. PRESCHOOLS

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:38.486
AND YOU KNOW ALL THAT AND I'M

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:39.387
I'M CURRENTLY AS OF COURSE OKAY.

01:32:39.453 --> 01:32:40.755
I GIVEN AND PEOPLE TELL ME

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.490
THEY'RE STILL BIG HOLE- I'M NOT

01:32:42.556 --> 01:32:44.191
SURE IF I'M CONTRIBUTING TO THE

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:45.259
WHOLE OR WHAT I'M TELLING THE

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:47.161
WHOLE SO. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.063
THE WHOLE LOOKS LIKE- SO I CAN

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.831
HAVE SOME IDEA AS WELL AS- AS

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.266
WHAT WHAT THE CONFERENCE OF

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.467
SERVICE WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:55.202
PEOPLE. SO THERE IS A GREATER

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:57.004
SENSE OF ENGAGEMENT IN. AN

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.639
INFORMATION AND THAT WE FEEL

01:32:58.706 --> 01:33:00.308
GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. I

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:01.909
THINK EVERYONE FEELS GOOD THAT

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:02.543
THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.745
DO- BUT PROBABLYNOT THE BEST

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:07.281
THIS NECESSARY. AND I THINK

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:08.582
THAT'S THE ONGOING CHALLENGE.

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:10.017
YEAH AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.653
THING IS AN ACT WE HAVE BOTH OF

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.289
US BUT CERTAINLY- ON THE COURT

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:16.857
SIDE WE HAVE REALLY ALSO REALLY

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:18.359
TRY TO WORK WITH TECHNOLOGY AND

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:19.593
I THINK THAT. HAS MADE A HUGE

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.562
DIFFERENCE RIGHT. BEING ABLE

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:24.031
FILL OUT FORMS ONLINE. SO THAT

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:24.532
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:25.766
REPETITIVE TYPING AND THE

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.201
INFORMATION GET SAVE FROM HER.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:28.336
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TIME

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:30.237
SEPARATE THE SELF HELP CENTER.

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:31.939
HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:32.940
THE WORLD. IT USED TO TAKE

01:33:33.007 --> 01:33:34.008
VOLUNTEER SOMEONE OF OUR

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.676
PROGRAMS. OUR STUDIO A

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:38.279
CONSERVATORSHIP BUT WITH ONE OF

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:38.846
THE PROGRAM SO WE DEVELOPED.

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:40.848
NOW FIFTEEN MINUTES. RIGHT SO

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.283
YOU CAN SAY THAT TIME AND

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:44.885
ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THE PROCESS.

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:45.386
AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.722
SOMEBODY. SO THOSE KINDS OF

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:50.091
TECHNOLOGICAL. FOR MAKING.

01:33:50.157 --> 01:33:55.029
DIFFERENCE HOW MORE IN. ON LINE.

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:59.166
HE HE TO RAISE. PHONE UP. SO

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:03.170
THAT. WAY COMING. A REAL FOCUS

01:34:03.237 --> 01:34:07.775
STERN. IS MY- A DIFFERENCE.

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:13.247
IT'D CHANGE I. A LOT TRACK PILE

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:20.287
TO DO. WE HAD ABOUT SEVENTEEN

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:24.725
HUNDRED PEOPLE. USE LIVE TRACT-

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:25.860
IN A VERY SHORT I THINK WITH

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:28.129
THIS NINE WEEK PERIOD AND- THEY

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:29.764

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:31.232
WE WERE STARVING ABOUT SEVEN

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.434
PEOPLE IN OUR- WITH NO

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.869
PUBLICITY. IT WAS JUST OFF FROM

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:36.370
THE SELF HELP WEBSITE I HAD NO

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:37.938

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.440
MUCH NEED FOR. NAME CHANGE A

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.841

IMMIGRATION THERE A LOT OF

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:43.411
OTHER THINGS. BUT I THINK THAT

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:45.613
COMBINATION. OF USING THE

01:34:45.679 --> 01:34:47.481
TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN BEING

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:48.816
THERE FOR THOSE PEPLE WHO ARE

01:34:48.883 --> 01:34:49.717
JUST NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:51.752
TECHNOLOGY. THE PEOPLE WHO COME

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:54.522
TO THE COURT AND- WATSONVILLE.

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:55.122
WHO'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.625
ELEVATOR BEFORE. IN ALL. OF

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:59.994
THEM. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.996
HOPPING ON THEIR MOBILE PHONES-

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.564
TO WIN A LOT OF LEGAL TECH WORK

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.132
RIGHT SO WE NEED TO HAVE

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.101
PEOPLE. WHO CAN DO THAT. AND

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.136
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO IF I'M IN

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:09.904
THE MIDDLE FOR PROBATE

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:11.338
SITUATION I'M DEALING WITH THE

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:13.307
DEATH OF A LOVED ONE. IT IS NOT

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:14.975
A GREAT TIME TO BE LEARNING HOW

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.944
TO USE TECHNOLOGY AND- TO MY

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.612
LEGAL WORK SO YOU. SO IT'S THAT

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:23.217

THE WAY WE CAN SEE THAT IS THAT

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:48.888
EACH COURT WOULD IDENTIFY ITS

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:51.191
SPECIIC ACCESS GAPS BECAUSE

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:54.127
COURTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:54.727
VERY DIFFERENT AS WE DISCUSSED

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:56.462
ALREADY. AND THAT COURT WOULD

01:53:56.529 --> 01:53:58.831
MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR THE

01:53:58.898 --> 01:53:59.732

WITH EACH OTHER AND SHARE IDEAS

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.101
AND IT WOULD BE A PLACE FOR

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:37.537
PEOPLE TO SEE TO LOG WITH

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:39.272

THAT THE SCALE BUT IT'S AN

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:41.560
IMPORTANT PIECE OF A COMMUNITY

CAL COLLABORATION WE GET GREAT

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:46.465
BENEFIT FROM AS WELL- SO WHAT

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:47.166
WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE

02:06:47.232 --> 02:06:49.535
WITH THE NAVIGATORS IS ASK EACH

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:52.204
COURT TO LOOK AT THEIR SYSTEM

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:54.006
AS A SYSTEM. AND TO LOOK AT IT

02:06:54.073 --> 02:06:56.108
WE'RE IS HELP NEEDED AND WHERE

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.844
IS IT THE RIGHT MATCH BETWEEN

02:06:58.911 --> 02:06:59.545
THE CREDENTIALS OF

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.714
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE HELPERS

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.382
AND THE NEEDS OF THE OF THE

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:04.850
LITIGANTS IF THEY MAKE A

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:06.318
PROPOSAL IS A BUSINESS PROPOSAL

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:07.219
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.655
WITH NAVIGATORS. THEN WE START

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:10.990
GIVING THEM ALL THE SUPPORT CAN

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:12.725
AND CONNECTING THEM SO THAT

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:14.560
THEY CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER WE

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:16.628
HOPE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.297
RICH IN IDEAS. AND THEN WE'RE

02:07:18.364 --> 02:07:20.099

PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THIS

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.208
RECESS WERE THEY RECOMMEND SO

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:30.809
WE THINK THAT MIGHT STARTING

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:32.878
THE GROUND AND TRACKING AND

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:34.213

IN THE LAW LIBRARY LAW

WALLER HELPED TACKLE THAT WENT.

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:58.470
IN SOME WAYS I THINK OUR ANSWER

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:01.740
TO THIS QUESTION IS EASIER THAN

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:03.308

EVERYTHING SO WHAT'S MOST

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:22.221

IF THEY DO RECOGNIZE IT'S A

02:09:58.090 --> 02:10:01.693

THAT WE GIVE THEM TO THEM THE

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:55.080
PROP AS. FOR US WE'RE.

02:10:55.147 --> 02:10:57.149
FORMATION THAT THEY HAVE THEN

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:59.885
WE CAN BUILD ON THAT- AND-

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.621
CAPTURE THE REST OF IT. AND

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:03.755
THAT'S GREAT AND IT SHOULD WE

02:11:03.822 --> 02:11:05.757
AND JUDGE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE

02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:07.993
MIDDLE OF THE SUGGEST COUNSEL

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:08.560
BUT ALSO TRYING TO MANAGE A

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:10.596
COURT. ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:13.131
BE LOOKING HARDER AT FROM RULES

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:14.299
AND PROCEDURES AND OTHERS IN

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:17.102
CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZING. AND

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:17.636
WHERE WE'VE COME WITH THE

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.571
REALITY IS. ONE OF THE THINGS

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:21.340
WE DO AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

02:11:21.406 --> 02:11:22.140
DOES IS THEY TRY TO MAKE THE

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:24.376
FORMS EASIER AND SIMPLER TO

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:26.478
FOLLOW BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY. FOR

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:28.413
SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.047
LOOK AT SOME OF THESE FORMS AND

02:11:29.114 --> 02:11:31.016
YOU. JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:32.351
SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:33.485
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TRYING TO

02:11:33.552 --> 02:11:35.454
MAKE THE FORMS. EASY TO

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.955
UNDERSTAND I CALL IT SIMPLE

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:38.991
ENGLISH. SO THAT WHEN YOU READ

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.392
IT IT MAKES SENSE IT'S NOT

02:11:40.459 --> 02:11:42.127
LEGAL JARGON THAT PEOPLE JUST

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:42.761
REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:44.896
FOLLOWING. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF

02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:46.598
TIME DOING THAT AND WORKING

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:48.333
WITH. THE COUNTY LAW LIBRARY

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:50.936
THERE ARE PARTNER AND WE LOOK

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.571
TO THEM TO HELP US WITH THESE

02:11:52.638 --> 02:11:54.906
FORMS AND- PUT THESE FORMS OUT

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:56.041
FOR A CUP PUBLIC COMMENT.

02:11:56.108 --> 02:11:57.376
BEFORE WE ADOPT THE RULES BY

02:11:57.442 --> 02:11:59.011
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO THAT WE

02:11:59.077 --> 02:12:01.346
HAVE CLEAR FORMS THAT'S WHY FOR

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:03.081
EXAMPLE THAT THE GUIDING FILE

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.950
WERE YOU GO ONLINE AND- I

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:05.917
SHOWED YOU ARE EMPLOYED

JEANETTE SHE WALKS YOU THROUGH

02:12:07.953 --> 02:12:09.054
THE FORM. OF A LOT OF TIMES

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:10.355
IT'S DIFFICULT FROM LEGAL

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:11.823
ASPECT BECAUSE YOU DON'T

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.225
UNDERSTAND THE PHRASEOLOGY

02:12:13.292 --> 02:12:15.160
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. YOU

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:16.261
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CERTAIN

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:18.930
THE MEANING. OF WEEK SIMPLIFY

02:12:18.997 --> 02:12:20.666
IT AND IF YOU GO ON OUR WEBSITE

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:22.601
THEY'LL BASICALLY ASK YOU GIVE

02:12:22.668 --> 02:12:24.369
YOU PROPS CERTAIN QUESTIONS. SO

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.737
YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.339
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT. JUST

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:28.940
UNDERSTANDING IN ITS HEART I

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.542
MEAN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL FOR

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:32.411
YEARS I'VE BEEN A- GOOD FROM

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:33.779
TWENTY SO AND I SEE DON'T HAVE

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:35.647
THE ANSWERS. SO SOMEONE WOULD

02:12:35.714 --> 02:12:38.350
NEVER BEEN THE LAW SCHOOL EVEN

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:39.651
CALL OR MAYBE GRABBED HIGH

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:42.054
SCHOOL IT'S AND- DIFFICULT VERY

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.456
CONFUSING. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.457
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS BASED

02:12:45.524 --> 02:12:54.032
ON. ADVERSE HE'S. IT'S ALL. ON

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:54.533
UP THAT IF YOU DON'T GET

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:55.434
EVERYTHING A- RIGHT. A BECOME

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.002
SORT OF A GOTCHA FOR THE SIDE.

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.736
CAN HAVE NOW YOU HAVE A

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:58.870
UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS. WHO A

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.872
LEGITIMATE. THE HE DOES THEY

02:13:00.939 --> 02:13:01.506
DON'T KNOW. THE JAR THEY DON'T

02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:02.574
UNDERSTAND. THE CASE OUGHT AND

02:13:02.641 --> 02:13:04.776
WHY. THAT WORDING IS DONE EXACT

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:05.877
THE WAY THAT IS THAT THEN

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.346
BECOMES A GOTCHA TO SOMEBODY

02:13:07.412 --> 02:13:09.614
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TRAP. IN

02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:11.049
THAT SITUATION RIGHT IN AS THAT

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:12.351
IS THE REALITY THAN LAWYERS WE

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:13.752
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:15.387
MAKE SURE IT'S LEGALLY PROPER

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:17.389
THE FORMS. THAT THE PROCESS IS

02:13:17.456 --> 02:13:19.324
FAIR THAT THE PROCESS WORKS.

02:13:19.391 --> 02:13:20.959
BUT MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC

02:13:21.026 --> 02:13:22.594
UNDERSTANDS THAT AND HOW THEY

02:13:22.661 --> 02:13:24.830
FIT IN. AND WHAT THEY NEED TO

02:13:24.896 --> 02:13:26.298
SAY AND GET IT RIGHT. THAT'S

02:13:26.365 --> 02:13:29.034
THE CHALLENGE AND THAT'S WHERE

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:29.601
ALL OF US HAVE TO WORK AS A

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:33.405
TEAM. MA'AM GOOD DOCTOR WEB

02:13:39.177 --> 02:13:40.946
BECAUSE I THINK YOU FOR

02:13:41.012 --> 02:13:42.447
CLARIFYING THAT MATTER IN TERMS

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.348
OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.584
LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR FOR THE

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:48.887
LAY PERSON VERSUS BECAUSE I'VE

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:50.789
BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE. THE

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:52.557
PERSON DID NOT UNDERSTAND. AND

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:53.792
THEY SPOKE ENGLISH THEY JUST

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:54.993
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:57.596
TERMINOLOGY USED BY THE LAWYER

02:13:57.662 --> 02:13:59.798
OR THE JUDGE- WAS JUST SO

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:02.000
DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES LAWYERS

02:14:02.067 --> 02:14:03.001
GET IN A CIRCLE NOW TALK THE

02:14:03.068 --> 02:14:04.469
SAME THING I WAS MAYOR TO ONCE

02:14:04.536 --> 02:14:06.638
THEY ALL. GOT THE SAME THING.

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:09.141
AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:09.741
INTERPRETATION FOR MY KIDS SO

02:14:09.808 --> 02:14:11.243
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:13.111
FATHER WAS SAYING WHEN THEY

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:14.646
WERE LITTLE. BUT IT'S A IT'S A

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:16.548
DIFFICULT- YOU KNOW BECAUSE

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:17.649
THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER JUST

02:14:17.716 --> 02:14:18.617
DIFFICULT FOR THE AVERAGE

02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:19.651
PERSON BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE

02:14:19.718 --> 02:14:20.919
SAYING IS VERY CLEAR TO THEM.

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:22.053
SO I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S A

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.289
DISCUSSION OF THAT BECAUSE THAT

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:25.791
IS SOMETIMES THE GREATEST BERRY

02:14:25.857 --> 02:14:27.426
WE THINK. SB KEYS BECAUSE

02:14:27.492 --> 02:14:29.594
EVERYONE'S QUOTE SPEAKS ENGLISH

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:30.228
THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND AND

02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:31.663
THEY DON'T. AND THAT'S ONE OF

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:33.098
THE THINGS WE TRY TO DO ON THE

02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:34.533
PROVIDING ACCESS AND PARENTS

02:14:34.599 --> 02:14:35.267
COMMITTEES AND LOOK AT THESE

02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:37.202
FORMS. AND SAY YOU KNOW CAN THE

02:14:37.269 --> 02:14:38.870
AVERAGE PERSON WHO HAS AMEND

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:40.939
THE LAW SCHOOL HAS A- MINIMAL

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:42.507
AMOUNT OF EDUCATION UNDERSTAND.

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:45.977
HOW TO GET FROM QUEST AND WANT

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:47.512
TO QUESTION FIFTEEN. ON THIS

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:48.880
FORM THANKS THEY CAN THEN THE

02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:50.415
FORM NOT WORKING YEAH SO WE

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:51.349
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON. HOW

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:53.018
DIVERSE IS THE POPULATION OF

02:14:53.084 --> 02:14:54.286
INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU HAVE

02:14:54.352 --> 02:14:56.087
WORKING AND ALL THAT SO FOR

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:57.556
JUSTICE COURT FOR. ALL THE

02:14:57.622 --> 02:14:59.424
MAJORITY OF THE K ÁI

02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:01.293
COLUMN KIDS BUT- COLLEGE- ARE

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:04.262
LATINO HISPANIC. WE HAVE ABOUT

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:05.831
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THIRTY SOME

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:07.833
ODD PERCENT. OF THE THREE

02:15:07.899 --> 02:15:08.700
HUNDRED. LATINO HISPANIC

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:11.303
THERE'S ABOUT ANOTHER. AT

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:13.905
FIFTEEN AND 19% OF ASIAN ABOUT

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:16.241
5010% AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND WE

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:17.909
KIND OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:20.512
TRY TO. GET PEOPLE. IN JUSTICE

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:21.847
CORPS WHO LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE

THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRIVING.

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:25.517
BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE TALK

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:26.485

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:28.153
MAKING THINGS MEANINGFUL IT'S

02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.155
ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT EASIER WHEN

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:31.289
YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:33.358
