ON THE MINISTRATIONS ESTIMATE

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:28.599
THE PROPOSAL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:29.967
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.769
CALIFORNIANS. BETWEEN THE

OLDER ADULTS EXPANSION APPROVED

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:37.475
LAST YEAR WHEN WE ROUGHLY

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:38.576
ESTIMATE THE UNINSURED

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.278
POPULATION IN THE STATE COULD BE

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.412
REDUCED BY ABOUT ONE MILLION

POPULATION IN THE STATE. WE WANT

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.153

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.188
. IN REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSED

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:54.158
EXPANSION- BUT WE KNOW THAT WE

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:55.059
ARE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE

EXPANSION IS SUBJECT TO

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.467
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.701
TERMS OF THESE ESTIMATES. NOW

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.403
CAN I CAN NOTE THAT IT DOES IT

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.038
DOESN'T INVOLVE AN EXTENDED TIME

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.139
BRING RELATIVE TO PAST

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.274
EXPANSIONS AND IT HAS AN IMPACT

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:12.009
ON ACCESS TO COVERAGE. A SHORT

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.644
IMPLEMENTATION PRIME BRING

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:15.246
SIMILAR TO THAT PAST EXPANSIONS

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:17.915
COULD IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.784
CARE SOONER. THE END EXPECT.

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:21.252
EXTENDED TIME FRAME COULD BE

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:22.720
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.055
PEOPLE WHO ARE EIGHT OUT OF FOUR

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:26.424
SKEPTICAL MEDI CAL IF THE TRUMP

GETTING ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.163
IN SUCH CASES THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.464
WOULD BE SHIFTED TO LIMITED

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.399
SCOPE MEDIC HAL WHICH ONLY

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.400
COVERS EMERGENCY SERVICE IN

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:38.603

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:41.772
BACK TO FULL SCOPE AFTER JANUARY

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.406

LAPSE IN COVERAGE. WELL WE ARE

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.909
CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE

POTENTIAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.912

ESTIMATE THAT TYPICAL YEAR OF

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.581
THE NUMBER OF UNDOCKING

RESIDENTS YOU AGE OUT OF

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:56.387
COVERAGE. IS. LIKELY IN THE LOW

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:57.855
TENS OF THOUSANDS. THIS WOULD BE

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.357
MUCH HIGHER END UP YOUR- DUE TO

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.992
A THE FEDERAL. DON'T PUBLIC

THE MINISTRATION HAS STATED THAT

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.572
IT WOULD BE WORKLOAD CHALLENGES

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:15.706
WITH AN OLDER IMPLEMENTATION

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:17.308
CONSISTENT CHANGES AT THE COUNTY

WATER CHALLENGES ARE REAL BUT

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:26.117
THEY CAN INCREMENTAL APPROACH

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:28.286
COULD EXPAND COVERAGE FASTER

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:29.320
WITH MORE MANAGEABLE WORKLOAD

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:31.055
IN. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.690
COULD TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT LOTS

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:33.958
OF BOTH GOOD COVERAGE OF PEOPLE

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.960

FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. NOT TO

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:44.862
HAVE THEM HAVE COVERAGE. HAVE TO

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.298

WE ENGAGE OUR COUNTY PARTNERS

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.714
BECAUSE THIS WOULD LIKELY

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.583
INVOLVE MANUAL OVERRIDES IN IT

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.118

THIS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THIS-

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.660
THIS TYPE OF LOGIC IS PROBABLY

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.595
MORE OF A MANUAL OVERRIDE. I'M

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:19.563
WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ONE

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.434
SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT THE TBL-

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:25.836
WITHIN YOUR PROPOSAL IT STATES

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:27.772
THAT THIS WILL ONLY OCCUR AFTER

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:30.174
THE DIRECTOR DETERMINES. THAT

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.276
THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:34.211
FOR IMPLEMENTATION. I WAS HOPING

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:36.213
YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT THIS

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.716
MEANS SPECIFICALLY AND- WHETHER

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.785

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:45.856
I. T. SYSTEM UPGRADES YOU WERE-MENTIONING EARLIER AND HOPING

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.892
YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME CLARITY.

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.093
I THINK WE GENERALLY INCLUDE

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.661
THAT IS A STANDARD JUST WRITING

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.463

ELIGIBILITY- AUTOMATICALLY AND

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.535
THAT IT'S NOT A MANUAL PROCESS

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:59.036

TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A VERY

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.404
HIGH LEVEL- WITH A POTENTIAL

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.706
EXEMPTION UP ADMINISTRATIONS

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:04.974
CAREFUL SOMETIMES WE GENERALLY

ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:25.294
TWENTY THREE THIS TRANSLATES TO

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:27.162
ABOUT A 30% INCREASE YEAR OVER

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:30.733
YEAR I HAVE ABOUT 80% OF THIS-

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:33.235
PROVIDES TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS.

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:34.003
AND THE REMAINING TWENTY

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.604
PERCENT. REFLECTS NEW

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.072
DISCRETIONARY PROPOSALS THAT

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:41.844
WOULD IMPLEMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:42.845
TO TWENTY THREE. ON THE PHD.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.713
POLITICAL EMERGENCY. THIS IS THE

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.348
MOST SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:47.750
THE MEDICAL BUDGET AND ISN'T

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.552
THIS SEEMS EXPIRATION THE

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.888
MINISTRATION- WOULD MEAN FOR

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.758
JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHAT IT

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:58.127
DOES ULTIMATELY AND THIS WILL.

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.461
TRIGGER TWO MAJOR THINGS OR IF

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:02.898
THEY'LL BE A MENTOR- DECREASE IN

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:06.035
FINAL FOUR MATIC CAL. AND ALSO

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:06.902
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OF

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.371
BUILDING TERMINATIONS- THAT

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.273
WOULD BE A BIG DROP IN CASELOAD

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.908
AS THE- ADMINISTRATION'S NOTED

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.311
JOIN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.613
THERE'S BAD IT UP ACTIVELY

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.948
APPLAUSE ON THE BUILDING

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:20.849
TERMINATIONS FOR MOST PEOPLE A

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:28.324
MEDIC CAL WHICH THE LAN CABLE.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.226
TO GROW SUBSTANTIALLY. THAT

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:33.162
MEANS THE OF THE THAT AMOUNT OF

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:34.663
FUNDING THAT IT ON STATE RISK

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.365
AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY MORE

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.200
THAN OFFSETS AT AMOUNT. SO IF

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:39.368
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.537
EXTENT THE JUNE- THERE COULD BE

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.005
SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL SIGN FOR THE

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.474
STATE- MICHAEL. RANGE OF

01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:47.176
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

IN GENERAL FUND. FOR EACH NINETY

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:51.513
DAY EXTENSION. IN TERMS OF THE

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.415
CASELOAD ASSUMPTION. WE FIND

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.184
THAT THEY ARE OF. DUE TO SLOWER

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.719
ALTHOUGH STILL POSITIVE CASE OF

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:58.120
GROWTH IN RECENT MONTHS AND WHAT

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.856
WAS THE SCENE IN THE BUDGET. AND

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.558
WE KNOW THAT THE BUDGET YOUR- OF

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.326
AND HAVE A GOOD ONE THAT HE H.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:09.331
E. ON AND DATE AND PROPERTIES. I

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.799
ALSO DIFFER DIMINISH ON K. THE

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:13.068
NAY. NONE OF THE WEAPONS THAT TO

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:14.470
DEVELOP DETERMINE. ARE WHAT CAR

. AND PUBLIC HEALTH. LBS MORE

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.441
COULD IN HIGH. CASE SUCH AS THE

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:21.977
NEW YORK PERSONS INSTANT. THIS

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.912
IS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:27.282
FISCAL ESTIMATES WHAT CASELOAD.

01:11:27.349 --> 01:11:28.784
A FINAL ISSUE THAT I WOULD RAISE

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:31.053
IT IS RELATED TO THE MCO TAX

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.287
WHICH THE TOP ONE MANAGED CARE

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:37.226
ORGANIZATIONS- THANK YOU THE-

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.627
I'M NOT THE REVENUE FROM THIS

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.129

FUND BENEFIT OF OVER ONE POINT

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.270
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND IS ONE

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.271
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.973
INCLUDES FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.107
STATE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.243
ABLE TO TALK ON THE TAX. THE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:54.910
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.512
PROPOSE TO EXTEND AND SEE WHAT

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.113
HAPPENS DEADLOCK WOULD LOVE TO

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.883
EXPIRE HALFWAY THROUGH TWENTY

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:01.550
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE RESULT IN

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:04.687
THE LOSS OF THIS ROUGHLY ONE

BENEFIT. THE MILITARY HAS NOTED

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:08.524
THAT LIKE BIG CHANGES AROUND

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.858
WHICH NCOS PARTICIPATED IN

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.460
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE DID WAS

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.895
DELIBERATE BUT YOU'RE ONLY AS

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.329
WELL AS ANTICIPATED VOLATILITY

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.565
IN THE CASE OF COMPLICATED WE

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:21.704
KNEW ALL UP AND. SEALED TAX. WE

01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:23.739
AGREED IT IS RID YOU MAKE CAUSE

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:26.008
CHANGE. BUT THESE WOULD BE. IN

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.343
NATURE. NOT THE OPPORTUNE I. OF

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:33.015
A HELP CENTER SORT OUT. I THINK

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.450
YOU ARE GOING TO THREE OPTIONS

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:35.884
FOR THE LAST TO CAN. FOR ALLEGED

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.486
COULD WITH THE AND TAX BASED ON

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.456
THE EXISTING FOR ONE. CALGARY OR

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.790
- IN THIS WOULD ALLOW THAT STATE

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.592
OVER THAT HOW EVERYBODY SHERMAN

01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:44.560
SAID THE CHANGE IN TIME TO NOT

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:46.929
ABOUT HIS. CAR TOLD TWENTY FOUR.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.297
OR TWENTY FOUR LATER YEARS

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:49.498
LEGISLATION NEED TO CONSIDER

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.566
WHEN IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:55.137
ENTERING. INTO TALKS. ABSOLUTELY

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.405
THE NEW. LEGISLATURE COULD MORE

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.407
YEAR RE AUTHORED THAT TALKS THAT

01:12:58.474 --> 01:12:59.742
WOULD BE IN PLACE BOTH BEFORE

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.610
AND AFTER THE REBOOT YOUR MEANT.

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.112
A LOT OF VACATIONS YOUR DRAFT

CHALLENGES INTRODUCED BY THE

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:06.648
WEEK WHAT YOU WANT. AND FINALLY

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:07.950
THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALLOW THE

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.585
MCO TAX TO BLOCKS AND THEN WE

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.820
KNEW IT AT A LATER DATE SUCH AS

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:12.421
THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.089
TWENTY FIVE. THE STATE HAS A

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:14.957
BETTER IDEA WHICH INSTILLS ABOUT

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:17.359

THIRTY THREE OF THE AGENDA.

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:35.410
THERE'S A LINE ITEM FOR FOUR

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:36.378

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.873
BILL AND- INTRODUCED ON THIS

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:18.644

REQUIRED TO SPEND DOWN TO THIS

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:28.053
MAINTENANCE INCOME LEVEL- NEED

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.688
INCOME LEVEL THAT HASN'T BEEN

ADJUSTED FOR PROBABLY FORTY

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:35.928
YEARS- CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THIS

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:38.730

OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE AND HERE'S

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:44.136
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:45.938
WHAT AM I MISSING. THIS IS FOR

02:10:46.004 --> 02:10:48.207

YOU KNOW AS WE EVALUATED A

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:55.847
NUMBER OF AREAS- ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.083
EMERGENCY IN THE WAVING OF

02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:59.851
PREMIUMS WHERE WE ZEROED IN IN

02:10:59.918 --> 02:11:01.653

IT'S CURRENTLY NOT A PART OF THE

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:14.566
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:15.734
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS ANOTHER

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:18.203
AREA. OF FOCUS. LET ME JUST

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:19.204
POINT I MEAN WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:20.339
THESE ARE THIS IS DEALING WITH

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:23.075
PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED. OR FOR

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.710

KNOW MORE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

02:11:29.414 --> 02:11:32.217
AND SO- TECHNICALLY POSSIBLY

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.518
HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR HEALTH

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:35.654
CARE SO IT I'M SORRY DOES THAT

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:37.089
PART DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I HOPE

02:11:37.155 --> 02:11:39.358
THAT WE COULD CONSIDER AN

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:40.359
ADJUSTMENT TO THAT IN THE

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:42.995
FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I

02:11:43.061 --> 02:11:45.163
WILL FOLLOW UP ON ONE QUESTION

02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:47.566
FOR THE DEPARTMENT- REGARDING

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:50.402
THE COPAYMENTS- THERE WAS A-

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:52.704
DEPARTMENTAL FACT SHEET FROM DH

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:55.307
CS. I WAS HOPING TO UNDERSTAND

02:11:55.374 --> 02:11:58.410
THE RATIONALE FOR QUOTE UNLESS

02:11:58.477 --> 02:12:01.213
REINSTATED FOR ANY IMPACTED

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.815
STATE FISCAL YEAR END QUOTE. IF

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:06.518
THE COPAYMENTS GO TO PROVIDERS

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.987
AS YOU MENTIONED AND NOT TOWARDS

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:12.724
DH CS. WHY WOULD IT MATTER WHAT

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:18.664
THE STATE FISCAL YEAR IS LIKE. I

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.799
THINK THAT'S JUST- I YOU KNOW

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.100
ENSURING THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:24.536
THE LANGUAGE IS NOT ELIMINATING

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:26.772
COPAYMENTS IT'S RESERVE REDUCING

02:12:26.838 --> 02:12:29.441
THE COPAYMENT DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO

02:12:29.508 --> 02:12:31.109
ZERO I'M SO IF AND WHEN OR IF IN

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:33.312
THE FUTURE THERE IS A NEED TO RE

02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:35.547
INSTITUTE COPAYMENTS. ARE THAT

02:12:35.614 --> 02:12:38.250
THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE UNDER

02:12:38.317 --> 02:12:40.419
STATE STATUTE. THANK THE ONLY

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:42.321
POINT I'M TRYING TO REITERATE IS

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:44.423
THE ONE YOU MADE TO US WHICH IS

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:45.924
THE STATE DOESN'T RECEIVE

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.260
BENEFIT FROM THESE. COPAYMENTS

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:50.128
AND SO WIDE IS OUR FISCAL

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:52.331
CONDITION FOR THE STATE MATTER

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:54.666
AND THUS WHY ARE WE USING THAT

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:57.369
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IS. THE ORIGIN

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:59.771
OF THE QUESTION HAPPY TO FOLLOW

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:02.074
UP MCCARTY TO. YEAH I KNOW I- I

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.343
THINK RIGHT NOW- I THINK THAT

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.711
MAJORITY OF OUR COPAYMENTS OR

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:08.747
DOLLAR FIVE FOR EXAMPLE- BUT IN

02:13:08.814 --> 02:13:10.315
THE FUTURE IF THEIR WORD TO BE A

02:13:10.382 --> 02:13:12.117
SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN THE

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:14.753
ECONOMY. OR OTHER ON DECISIONS

02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:16.088
THAT PEOPLE NEEDED TO MAKE YOU

02:13:16.154 --> 02:13:18.924
COULD PROPOSE A HIGHER COPAYMENT

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:20.525
ON THAT MAY BE MORE IMPACTFUL

02:13:20.592 --> 02:13:21.760
BUT CURRENTLY IT IS NOT

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.328
IMPACTFUL FROM A BUDGETARY

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:25.030
PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN WOULD NOTE

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.732
THOUGH IF WE WERE TO DO THAT IT

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:27.833
WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:29.868
INVESTMENTS IN REGARDS TO COSTS

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:31.636
AND SYSTEMS TO COME INTO

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:32.437
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:35.207
REGULATIONS- AS WELL SO IT WOULD

02:13:35.273 --> 02:13:38.009
BE COSTLY- I TAKE TO IMPLEMENT

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:39.211
IN THE FUTURE AND SO AT THIS

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:41.012
TIME. ARE RECOMMENDING BRINGING

02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:44.449
