00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.121
OCCASION THAT WE NEED TO AGREE

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:59.123

THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:22.446

00:42:23.807 --> 00:42:25.943
FACILITY SO TO BE HOLLISTER AND

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.481
THE CARED FOR I'M ON THE RAISING

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:34.785
THE QUESTION WHETHER -- WE HAD

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:37.121
SOMEONE IS -- ALL OVER THE LOCAL --

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.123

SUPPORTING YOUR IDEAS.

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.776
BECAUSE AS WE AS A COULD YOU SEE

00:42:58.842 --> 00:42:59.877

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:00.844
THAT THIS IS A STATE OWNED A

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:01.679

POSSIBLE TO COME TO A SOLUTION.

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:38.115

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:39.550

START OF THE CRIMINAL CASE TO

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:38.194
THE END OF THE CASE.

TRAUMA WHEN THEIR CHILDREN ARE

INVESTIGATED WHEN OUR CASES ARE

IN ADDITION RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.209
THAT WHEN CASES ARE INVESTIGATED

ON AVERAGE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.116
LESS PER CASE.

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.152
THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE BELL IT

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:04.354
SETS A MINIMUM FLOOR OF WHAT AN

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.922
ORGANIZATION CALLING ITSELF A

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.123

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.458
SHOULD PROVIDE.

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:10.326
THIS GIVES CLEAR TEACH CHILDREN

TO FAMILIES TO INVESTIGATORS TO

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:14.497

THE SAME PROTECTIONS.

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:31.648
AS I SAID THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.416
BUT IT'S A GIANT STEP FORWARD

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.684
FOR CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.119

FORMER CLIENT OF CALICO.

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:10.820
WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD I WAS

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.457
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE IT WAS HARD

FOR ME TO PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.894
WHAT IT HAPPENED TO ME.

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:19.796
BUT I KNEW THAT I'D BEEN HURT.

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:21.297
I WAS SCARED CONFUSED AND MOST

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:22.565
OF ALL I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.234

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.535

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.489
I COULD UNDERSTAND.

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.558
EVEN TODAY ELEVEN YEARS LATER I

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.926
CAN STILL REMEMBER HOW IT FELT

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:51.828
SITTING IN THE BIG COMFY CHAIR

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:53.363

COURAGE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.568
POSED BY THE CALICO INTERFERES.

00:58:58.635 --> 00:58:59.903
LOOKING BACK NOW I REALIZE HOW

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.404
FORTUNATE I WAS TO HAVE HAD A

FORCED TO RELIVE EASILY THE

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.015
WORST.

00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:13.149

HOWEVER MANY VICTIMS OF CHILD

HAVE THIS CENTER NEAR THEM TO

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:19.722

WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:46.555
AS A MISTER COOLEY NOTED

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.223
NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WAS A LONG

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.858
TIME AGO A LOT HAS CHANGED IN

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.926
THE WORLD AND IN PARTICULAR TO

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.161
RESET CHANGES THAT HE MENTIONED

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.063
THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT.

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.664
OF THE BASICALLY THE ENTIRE

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.166
CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.267
SYSTEM TO COUNTIES.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.536
AS A PART OF THIS REALIGNMENT

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.838
THE FUNDING -- FOR PART WAS

01:09:02.905 --> 01:09:04.640
ACTUALLY REALIGNED COUNTIES BUT

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.008
THERE WAS REALLY NO MECHANISM

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.276
FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES TO BE

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:08.811
ABLE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS OR

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:10.045
AMMO USE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.380
AGENCIES.

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.815
AND RATHER THAN BECAUSE

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.149
WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION AT THAT

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.252
TIME EIGHT YEARS AGO WE

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.853
TEMPORARILY -- CREATED A

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.455
STRUCTURE WHERE THE STATE WOULD

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.156
CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW UPON

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.458
THE REALIGNMENT RESOURCES AND

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:23.592
PAY THOSE CLAIMS.

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.394
THE IDEA OF THE WAS WE WOULD

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.428
FIGURE OUT AT SOME POINT HOT IT

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.130
YOU KNOW SORT OF CHANGE THAT

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.431
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTIES.

01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:30.933
THE ISSUE HAS BEEN HASTENED BY

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.668
THE OVERAGE IN THE LAST FEW

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:33.569
YEARS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.004
MENTIONED BUT ALSO THERE'S

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:36.338
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S

01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:38.374
BEING PROPOSED BY THE STATE. TO

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.042
ENABLE IT TO CONTINUE BILLING

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.610
THOSE COUNTIES WE HAVE BEEN

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:42.411
PAYING THE BILLS SORT OF AS A

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.113
COURTESY AGAIN ON A TEMPORARY

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.414
BASIS.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.282
AND THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.450
WOULD WE CANNOT CODIFY IT BUT

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.718
SORT OF MAKE THAT AN ONGOING

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.886
ISSUE AND WE REALIZE THAT WE

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:51.787
REALLY NEED TO TRY TO GET

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.290
LEGISLATION GOING. TO WORK WITH

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.524
THE ADOPTION AGENCY THEN AFTER

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.660
PHASE THAT ACT AS AGENCIES TO

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.461
PRESERVE THE PART PROGRAM BUT

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.030
MOVE FORWARD TO GET THAT DOWN TO

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:02.498
THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THAT WERE

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:04.266
THE ONES AUTHORIZING IT -- WE

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.501
HOPE AS PART OF THE PLACEMENT

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:06.869
AGREEMENTS THAT ALREADY EXIST

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.571
WE'RE NOT ASKING THESE AGENCIES

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:09.672
TO ENTER INTO INDIVIDUAL

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:10.906
CONTRACTS OF THE COUNTIES THAT

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.274
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE UNWIELDY.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.409
BUT WE THINK THAT WE CAN DO IT

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:15.110
IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS NOT AND

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.912
WE'LL BE THAT IT PRESERVES PARK.

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:19.114
AND ALSO -- ADDRESSES ONE OTHER

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:20.182
ISSUE THAT'S COME UP WITH THE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.383
CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM BIG

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.452
ACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO --

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:24.386
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.555
LEGISLATION WHAT THAT DID WAS GO

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:27.890
STATEWIDE WITH WHAT'S CALLED THE

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:30.159
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:32.227
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT MOVES A

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.596
LOT OF THE ADOPTION WORK.

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.064
UP FRONT AND COUNTIES ARE DOING

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:41.070
THAT AS PART OF OUR APPROVAL OF

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.471
THOSE RESOURCE FAMILY.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:43.405
THINGS LIKE A AN ADOPTION HOME

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:44.540
STUDY ARE NOW DONE AS PART OF

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:45.608
THAT PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:46.542
THAT THE COUNTIES DO ALREADY AS

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:46.942
PART OF OUR FAA.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:47.610
SO WHAT WE'RE THINKING IS GOING

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.578
TO HAPPEN OVER TIME IS THAT THAT

01:10:49.645 --> 01:10:50.746
WORK WON'T NEED TO BE DONE AS

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:52.214
MUCH BY THE PRIVATE ADOPTION

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.616
AGENCIES AN EFFORT FACED.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.217
AND THIS COULD END UP WELL WE'VE

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.285
SEEN OVER JUST FOR THE LAST FEW

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.020
YEARS AND ACTUALLY THING UNDER

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.588
SPENDING AND THOSE FUNDS BUT

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.889
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TIED UP THERE

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.491
AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE THERE

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.325
FOR THAT PART PROGRAM AND THAT'S

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:04.059
IT.

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:05.694
PARK ONLY HAS CERTAIN USES AND

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:07.129
ITS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.697
ADOPTIONS SO ALSO WITH THE BILL

01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.332
WHAT DO YOU AND MOVING THE FUNDS

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.201
TO THE COUNTIES WOULD ALLOW US

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.902
TO USE THAT -- IN PARTNERSHIP

01:11:13.969 --> 01:11:15.337
WITH THESE AGENCIES WE VALUE

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.139
VERY MUCH TO DO OTHER PLACEMENT

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.874
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES GUARDIANSHIP

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.377
SUPPORT ON IT COULD BE PRE PRE

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.012
OR POST PERMANENCY.

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.880
TRYING TO MAINTAIN AN ADOPTIVE

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:25.447
FAMILY OR MAINTAIN A

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.216
GUARDIANSHIP WE LIKE TO BE ABLE

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:28.617
TO FREE UP THOSE FUND SHOULD

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:30.052
THAT UNDER SPENDING OCCUR LIKE

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.487
WE THINK IT COULD BUT HAVEN'T

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:34.223
YET SEEN. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT --

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.291
WE'VE TRIED VERY STRONGLY TO

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.260
ADDRESS AT LEAST AS MANY AS WE

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:39.995
COULD OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.530
BEEN RAISED BY THE ADVOCATES --

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.465
AND THE AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:44.867
ALLIANCE WHO I THINK WILL

WITH THEM WE DON'T WANT TO PLOT

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:49.438
THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THESE

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.539
AGENCIES.

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.740
WE JUST THINK REALIGNMENT

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.075
HAPPENED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.910
WE IT IS TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:55.911
TO MOVE THIS PROGRAM DOWN TO THE

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.880
COUNTY LEVEL BUT KEEP IT WORKING

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:02.084

ADVOCATES UP WORKING OVER THE

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.556
LAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS TO REMOVE

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:41.724
THE BARRIERS TO PREVENT OUR

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.392

AS IF THE INTENTIONS OF THE BILL

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.334
BUT MY CONCERN.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.203
IS AROUND HOW IT'S CURRENTLY

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:55.637
WRITTEN.

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.372
BEFORE THE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.941
SEVEN LEGISLATION THAT CREATED

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.809
THE LANGUAGE THAT THE PARK

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:03.312
STATUTE CURRENTLY HAS.

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:05.247
MY SMALL AGENCY WHERE I WAS

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:07.783
PREVIOUSLY.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.221
ADOPTION.

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.522
THE YEAR PREVIOUS YEAR WE HAD

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.958
PLACED TWO HUNDRED HARD TO PLACE

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:17.159
CHILDREN INTO ADOPTED FAMILIES

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.561
NOT TWO HUNDRED TIMES FIVE

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:20.529
THOUSAND IS A MILLION DOLLAR

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:21.597
LOSS.

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.599
AS WE WATCH AGENCIES AROUND THE

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:24.933
STATE RELINQUISHING THEIR

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.436
ADOPTION LICENSES BECAUSE OF

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:30.005
THIS WE OURSELVES SERIOUSLY

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.040
CONSIDERED SHOULD WE STOP

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.475
PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.877
THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.545
LEGISLATION MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:39.114
US TO CONTINUE AND IN FACT.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.150
FOLLOWING AT THE NUMBER OF F. F.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:43.218
A.'S THAT.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.419
ACHIEVEMENT ADOPTION LICENSES

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:47.723
INCREASED BY 77% LEADING TO A

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.127
LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:53.328

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:58.066
ADOPTION.

01:13:58.133 --> 01:14:01.303
I KNOW THAT. THIRTEEN AB

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.104
THIRTEEN A ONE IS WELL

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.872
INTENTIONS AND I HAVE GREAT

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.908
ESTEEM FOR THE PEOPLE SITTING AT

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.042
THIS TABLE WE ARE COLLEAGUES

GENERAL WITH EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON

02:02:06.018 --> 02:02:06.919

EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICES AND

THAT FOR TOO LONG.

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:24.003
WAY TOO LONG REGIONAL CENTERS

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:25.204
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE WITH

02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:26.806
LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND NO REAL

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.107
TRANSPARENCY.

OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:02:51.997 --> 02:02:54.266
PROBLEM.

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:55.835
AS WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY.

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:57.036
RIDLEY THAT WE'RE FACING SO YOU

02:02:57.103 --> 02:02:58.671
UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEED A BILL OF

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:00.673
THIS KIND AND SECONDLY I WANT TO

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.608
EXPLAIN WHY WE THINK AB EIGHT

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:03.175
TWELVE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:04.710
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:05.811
SO SO THE COMPLICATED

02:03:05.878 --> 02:03:08.714
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DDS AND THE

02:03:08.781 --> 02:03:09.782
TWENTY ONE PRIVATE NON PROFIT

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:11.817
SAID OVERSEAS WHICH IS UNIQUE IN

THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO OTHER

02:03:12.918 --> 02:03:14.386
STATE THAT HAS THIS COMPLICATED

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:15.521
CONFIGURATION.

02:03:15.588 --> 02:03:16.622
MAKES ACCOUNTABILITY

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:18.657
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND THE

02:03:18.724 --> 02:03:20.092
WAY THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:21.460
UNFOLDED OVER THE PAST HALF

02:03:21.527 --> 02:03:23.429
CENTURY HAS LEAD TO CHRONIC AN

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:25.297
OFTEN QUITE DRAMATIC AS WE'VE

02:03:25.364 --> 02:03:27.166
HEARD SHORTFALLS IN OVERSIGHT

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:28.267
AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:03:28.334 --> 02:03:30.269
THIS IS NO SECRET BOTH THE STATE

02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:31.370
AUDITOR AND THE STATE

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:32.772
COMPTROLLER HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE

02:03:32.838 --> 02:03:34.507
SHORTFALLS IN REPORTS THAT

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.275
STRETCH BACK FOR DECADES AS

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:38.144
EARLY AS NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:39.745
THE STATE AUDITOR -- ISSUED A

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:41.313
REPORT HIGHLIGHTING THE FAILURE

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:42.748
OF THE DEPARTMENT TO HOLD

02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:44.550
REGIONAL CENTERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:03:44.617 --> 02:03:45.651
DISPARITIES ACROSS REGIONAL

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:46.352
CENTERS IN THE RECEIPT OF

02:03:46.418 --> 02:03:47.753
SERVICES A COULD NOT BE

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.021
JUSTIFIED BY DIFFERENCES AND

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:49.822
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:50.623
SERVE.

02:03:50.689 --> 02:03:52.658
AS RECENTLY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:53.893
THE STATE COMPTROLLER TOUCH AND

02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:55.461
VERY SIMILAR THEMES IN ITS

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:57.463
EVALUATION OF DD **** ON THE

02:03:57.530 --> 02:03:58.898
REGIONAL CENTERS USE OF STATE

02:03:58.964 --> 02:04:00.666
FUNDS -- WITH REGARD TO

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:02.168
COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND

02:04:02.234 --> 02:04:03.502
AUDITING STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL

02:04:03.569 --> 02:04:06.972
CONTROLS OR LACK THERE OF IN

02:04:07.039 --> 02:04:07.506
RESPONSE TO WITH THE BLUR

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:07.807
COMPLAINTS.

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:08.440
BUT YOU MIGHT WONDER WHAT DOES

02:04:08.507 --> 02:04:09.775
ALL THIS MEAN IN PRACTICE FOR

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:11.343
CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.913
WELL FIRST OF ALL -- IT MEANS

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:14.814
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SELF

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.482
DETERMINATION LAW WITH WHICH IS

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:18.217
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.151
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO.

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:20.753
AFTER A LONG SERIES OF DELAYS AS

02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.655
I SEE HERE TODAY STILL HAS NOT

02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:23.756
BEEN IMPLEMENTED.

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:25.057
IT MEANS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:04:25.124 --> 02:04:26.392
HAS SPENT THIRTY THREE MILLION

02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:28.527
DOLLARS IN THE PAST THREE YEARS.

02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:30.763
ON IN ORDER TO COMBAT ONGOING

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:32.064
RACIAL AND ETHNIC INEQUALITIES

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:34.500
IN OUR SYSTEM AND OVERTHE PAST

02:04:34.567 --> 02:04:35.201
THREE YEARS.

02:04:35.267 --> 02:04:36.969
THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN WHITES

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:38.470
AND LATINOS THE TWO LARGEST

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:39.905
GROUP SERVE BY THE SYSTEM HAVE

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:41.540
ACTUALLY GOTTEN BIGGER RATHER

02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:42.908
THAN SMALLER AFTER THE

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:44.977
EXPENDITURES OF OF THOSE THAT

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:46.011
THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:04:46.078 --> 02:04:47.947
ON THE SHORTFALL IN OVERSIGHT

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.682
AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO MEANS

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.050
THAT WE HAVE NOT YET BUILT A

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:53.652
SAFETY NET TO SUPPORT FAMILIES

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:55.354
AND CONSUMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT

02:04:55.421 --> 02:04:57.156
BEHAVIORAL AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS.

02:04:57.223 --> 02:04:58.524
SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING

02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:00.392
HELP THAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY

02:05:00.459 --> 02:05:01.527
NEED IT.

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:03.329
SO NOW THAT I'VE BRIEFLY ALLUDED

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:04.864
TO THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM

02:05:04.930 --> 02:05:06.031
THAT WE'RE FACING.

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:07.833
THERE'S TWO SIMPLE REASONS WHY

02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:09.401
WE FEEL THAT AB EIGHT TWELVE A

02:05:09.468 --> 02:05:10.636
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:05:10.703 --> 02:05:12.404
SO FIRST IT TRIES TO PUT THE

02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:14.940
GOAL OF OF ADDRESSING SHORTFALLS

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:17.176
IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.310
FRONT AND CENTER.

02:05:18.377 --> 02:05:21.780
SECONDLY IT BRINGS TOGETHER A

02:05:21.847 --> 02:05:23.048
NUMBER OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS.

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:24.783
DDS REGIONAL CENTERS DISABILITY

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.518
RIGHTS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL

STATE HONOR AND STATE CONTROLLER

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:29.288
TO DISCUSS THE SCOPE OF THE

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:30.789
ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEM AND MAKE

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.458
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.292
TO FIX IT.

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.027
NOW WE'D TV YOU DO HAVE SOME

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:36.762
THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ABOUT

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.430
HOW TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS OF

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:39.965
THIS BILL AND MAKE IT STRONGER.

02:05:40.032 --> 02:05:41.834

SIXTEEN OH EIGHT THIS BILL

02:33:14.118 --> 02:33:15.452
ADDRESSES A LONG STANDING

02:33:15.519 --> 02:33:17.421
PROBLEM WITH GETTING LICENSING

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:19.924
PERMITS AND CERTIFICATIONS TO

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.926

02:33:21.992 --> 02:33:23.794
RESIDENTIAL NURSING AND

02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:25.696
GENERALLY THE CARE OF CARE OF

02:33:25.763 --> 02:33:28.265
INDIVIDUALS -- CURRENT LAW

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:30.067
REQUIRES ANY PERSON WHO HAS A

02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:31.835
CONVICTION HISTORY FOR ANYTHING

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:33.637
OTHER THAN A TRAFFIC TICKET TO

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:35.172
APPLY FOR AN EXEMPTION TO BE

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:36.607
ELIGIBLE TO WORK.

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:38.642
EVEN IF THE CONDUCT CONVICTION

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:40.678
IS UNRELATED TO THE WORK AND IS

02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:42.279
DECADES OLD.

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:43.881
THIS EXEMPTION PROCESS IS

02:33:43.948 --> 02:33:45.783
ONEROUS AND OFTEN CAN TAKE

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:47.418
UPWARDS OF SIX MONTHS TO

02:33:47.484 --> 02:33:48.519
COMPLETE.

02:33:48.586 --> 02:33:50.721
AS A RESULT MANY OTHERWISE

02:33:50.788 --> 02:33:52.590
QUALIFIED APPLICANTS MISSED JOB

02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:54.792
OPPORTUNITIES SINCE JOBS COULD

02:33:54.858 --> 02:33:57.561
NOT BE HELD OPEN UNTIL THE

02:33:57.628 --> 02:33:58.929
PROCESS IS FINISHED.

02:33:58.996 --> 02:34:01.465
OUR COALITION PARTNERS AT THE

02:34:01.532 --> 02:34:03.233
EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER

02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.135
HAVE CONDUCTED -- OR LOOKED

02:34:05.202 --> 02:34:06.904
RESEARCH INTO HOW THE PROCESS

02:34:06.971 --> 02:34:08.439
AFFECTS APPLICANTS FOR THESE

02:34:08.505 --> 02:34:10.441
JOBS AND FOUND THAT THE VAST

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:12.443
MAJORITY OF THOSE IMPACTED BY

02:34:12.509 --> 02:34:14.878
THIS PROCESS ARE WOMEN OF COLOR

02:34:14.945 --> 02:34:16.780
PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:18.415
AND LOOKED LATINO WOMEN.

02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:20.851
WHO COMPRISE THE BULK OF

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:22.386
INDIVIDUALS DOING THIS WORK?

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:25.289
AB SIXTEEN OH EIGHT AS AMENDED --

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:27.691
HAS THREE COMPONENTS IT REQUIRES

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:29.994
THE D. S. S. S. TO KEEP BETTER

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.462
DATA REGARDING THE EXEMPTION

02:34:31.528 --> 02:34:33.163
PROCESS.

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:35.332
IT ELIMINATES THE CANDOR TRAP

02:34:35.399 --> 02:34:37.468
WHICH REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS TO

02:34:37.534 --> 02:34:39.069
SELF DISCLOSE INFORMATION THEY

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:40.771
MAY NOT KNOW REGARDING THEIR OWN

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:42.172
CRIMINAL RECORD.

02:34:42.239 --> 02:34:43.641
AND FINALLY IT BRINGS A

02:34:43.707 --> 02:34:45.676
SIMPLIFIED EXEMPTION PROCESS

02:34:45.743 --> 02:34:47.244
INTO STATUTE.

02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:48.946
THIS THIRD PART IS MOST

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:50.447
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW

02:34:50.514 --> 02:34:52.783
US TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:54.451
WITH THE CHILD CARE ADVOCATES

02:34:54.518 --> 02:34:56.286
ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE TO

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.888
QUALIFY FOR THIS SIMPLIFIED

02:34:57.955 --> 02:35:00.557
PROCESS -- WE'VE CONFIRMED WITH

02:35:00.624 --> 02:35:02.426
THE S. S. THAT THE SIMPLIFY

02:35:02.493 --> 02:35:04.561
PROCESS WILL TAKE ONLY TWO WEEKS

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:06.163
AS OPPOSED TO THE NORMAL

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:08.599
EXEMPTION PROCESS WHICH CAN TAKE

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:09.933
UP TO SIX MONTHS.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.136
DATA WE RECEIVE FROM THE DSS

02:35:12.202 --> 02:35:13.771
SHOWS THAT DURING A SIX MINUTE

02:35:13.837 --> 02:35:15.773
PERIOD LESS THAN 10% OF THE

02:35:15.839 --> 02:35:17.374
PEOPLE WHO APPLIED FOR AN

02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:20.310
EXEMPTION WERE ACTUALLY DENIED

02:35:20.377 --> 02:35:21.745
BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD.

02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:24.715
BUT A MAJORITY OF OVER SIX

02:35:24.782 --> 02:35:25.282
THOUSAND DROPPED OUT OF THE

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:27.985
PROCESSORS PROCESS OR HAD THEIR

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:30.287
APPLICATIONS WITHDRAW -- DUE

02:35:30.354 --> 02:35:31.722
SOLELY TO THE LAND AND

02:35:31.789 --> 02:35:34.792
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS.

02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:37.127
THIS BILL SUPPORT ALSO SUPPORTS

02:35:37.194 --> 02:35:38.962
PUBLIC SAFETY SINCE MANY OF

02:35:39.029 --> 02:35:41.065
THOSE WHO LOSE JOB OPPORTUNITIES

02:35:41.131 --> 02:35:42.332
DUE TO THE ONEROUS EXEMPTION

02:35:42.399 --> 02:35:44.802
PROCESS WILL OFTEN FIND JOBS

02:35:44.868 --> 02:35:47.171
DOING THE SAME WORK THAT ARE NOT

02:35:47.237 --> 02:35:48.572
LICENSED POSITIONS.

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:49.940
THEY DO NOT BENEFIT FROM

02:35:50.007 --> 02:35:51.341
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN

02:35:51.408 --> 02:35:53.610
THOSE POSITIONS HAVE ACCESS TO

02:35:53.677 --> 02:35:55.379
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ARE NOT

02:35:55.446 --> 02:35:57.448
LICENSE SO WE DO NOT HAVE THE

02:35:57.514 --> 02:35:59.717
ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THEM SHOULD

02:35:59.783 --> 02:36:01.085
ISSUES ARISE.

02:36:01.151 --> 02:36:02.720
THIS BILL WILL HELP TO CORRECT

02:36:02.786 --> 02:36:04.421
THIS AND MAKE LICENSING

02:36:04.488 --> 02:36:05.956
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERWISE

02:36:06.023 --> 02:36:07.591

AND ON A WEEKLY BASIS WITH THE

02:36:27.678 --> 02:36:28.912

WHO HAVE A PAST RECORD WERE

02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:31.181
TRYING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES

02:36:31.248 --> 02:36:33.383
BETTER AND ARMED WE STILL

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:34.384
COULDN'T WHEN TERMS A DSS IN

02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:36.186
PARTICULAR WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF

02:36:36.253 --> 02:36:37.621
IT AND ANECDOTALLY WE STARTED

02:36:37.688 --> 02:36:39.189
NOTICING A PATTERN WHERE WAS A

02:36:39.256 --> 02:36:40.257
LOT OF TIMES IT WAS?

02:36:40.324 --> 02:36:41.725
OLDER WOMEN A LOT OF TIMES IT

02:36:41.792 --> 02:36:42.760
WAS WOMEN OF COLOR ESPECIALLY

02:36:42.826 --> 02:36:43.861
AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN AND WE

02:36:43.927 --> 02:36:45.429
LOOKED AT OUR OWN DATA AND WE

02:36:45.496 --> 02:36:48.298
FOUND THAT 55% OF THE WOMEN WE

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:51.902
HELP GOING TO THIS PROCESS.

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:52.669
THAT WE HOPE WONDERS PROCESS

02:36:52.736 --> 02:36:53.203
WERE SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN

02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.804
AMERICAN WOMEN SO THAT SHOWS

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:56.140
THAT THERE'S CLEARLY ARM OF A

02:36:56.206 --> 02:36:59.409
ISSUE THAT -- FURTHERING ARM IN

02:36:59.476 --> 02:37:01.445
A SEXUALITY -- AND OPPRESSION OF

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:02.679
FOLKS WHO ARE.

02:37:02.746 --> 02:37:04.782
ALREADY STRUGGLING -- BUT THEN

02:37:04.848 --> 02:37:06.350
WE'RE ALSO SEEING HOW MANY

02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:06.950
PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS

02:37:07.017 --> 02:37:08.118
ARE PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT JUST

02:37:08.185 --> 02:37:08.786
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT

02:37:08.852 --> 02:37:10.521
WORKS AND WITH THE HELP OF

02:37:10.587 --> 02:37:11.655
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WERE ABLE

02:37:11.722 --> 02:37:12.890
TO GET SOME NUMBERS.

02:37:12.956 --> 02:37:14.191
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

02:37:14.258 --> 02:37:15.793
SERVICES FOR A SIX MONTH PERIOD

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.394
AND WE FOUND THAT.

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:18.729
OF THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD TO THIS

02:37:18.796 --> 02:37:20.364
PROCESS IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:21.498
OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DID

02:37:21.565 --> 02:37:23.433
IT BUT LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED

02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:24.635
ACTUALLY WERE DENIED BECAUSE OF

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:25.969
THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD.

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:27.070
THE BIGGEST GROUP WERE NOT

02:37:27.137 --> 02:37:28.906
PEOPLE DENIED OR APPROVED BUT AS

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:32.409
SABINA MENTION WERE FOLKS WHO

02:37:32.476 --> 02:37:34.678
DROPPED OUT DURING THE PROCESS.

02:37:34.745 --> 02:37:35.212
SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED

02:37:35.279 --> 02:37:35.846
THIRTY THREE PEOPLE DROPPED OUT

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:37.714
BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH AND THE

02:37:37.781 --> 02:37:39.950
COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS SO.

02:37:40.017 --> 02:37:41.418
THERE'S CLEARLY A PROBLEM HERE

02:37:41.485 --> 02:37:43.821
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED ARM WE

02:37:43.887 --> 02:37:44.788
HAVE BEEN.

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:46.557
SO HONORED TO WORK WITH SOME OF

02:37:46.623 --> 02:37:48.458
THE FOLKS IN THE CHILDCARE.

02:37:48.525 --> 02:37:49.860
INDUSTRY WHO.

ADDITIONALLY HAVE SOME DOUBTS

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:51.995
ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I THINK

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:53.463
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WAYS

02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:55.499
THAT WE CAN GET. TO THE SAME

02:37:55.566 --> 02:37:57.367
PLACE AND WE'RE I'M LOOKING

02:37:58.602 --> 02:38:00.037
WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

02:38:00.103 --> 02:38:02.573
SOLVE THIS ISSUE -- AND SOLVE

02:38:02.639 --> 02:38:04.908
THIS PROCESS ISSUE IN A WAY THAT

02:38:04.975 --> 02:38:06.143
ALLOWS FOLKS TO GET TO WORK.

02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:08.111
ARMED WITH OUT.

02:38:08.178 --> 02:38:09.546
WITHOUT CREATING ANY ISSUE ON

02:38:09.613 --> 02:38:11.682
PUBLIC SAFETY SO WITH THIS

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:12.482
AMENDMENT ALLOWS THAT TO GO

02:38:12.549 --> 02:38:14.952
FORWARD AND WE HOPE THAT YOU

02:38:15.018 --> 02:38:16.019
WILL SUPPORT THAT.

02:38:16.086 --> 02:38:17.554
THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE

ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS

02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:26.363
CALIFORNIA CHAPTER ONE I THINK

02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:27.598
THE AUTHOR FOR OFFERING THIS

02:38:27.664 --> 02:38:29.633
VERY IMPORTANT BELL MANY TIMES

02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.868
OUR SOCIAL WORKERS WANT TO GET

02:38:30.934 --> 02:38:32.236
THEY NEED TO GET AN INTERNSHIP

02:38:32.302 --> 02:38:33.570
WHILE THEY'RE GETTING THERE --

02:38:33.637 --> 02:38:34.872
UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:36.607
DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AND MANY

02:38:36.673 --> 02:38:39.042
COME FROM COMMUNITIES OF POVERTY

02:38:39.109 --> 02:38:40.444
SOME COME FROM THE FOSTER CARE

02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:42.813

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:43.947
INTERACTION WITH THE CRIMINAL

02:38:44.014 --> 02:38:45.048
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:38:45.115 --> 02:38:46.250
AND WHEN THEY TRY TO GET THEIR

02:38:46.316 --> 02:38:48.418
INTERNSHIP IT TAKES SIX MONTHS

02:38:48.485 --> 02:38:50.387
SO THEY LOSE THEIR INTERNSHIPS

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:50.854
AND THEY CAN'T GET THE

02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:52.322
INTERNSHIP THEY NEED -- OR

02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:53.657

OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY GRADUATE

02:38:55.225 --> 02:38:57.494
