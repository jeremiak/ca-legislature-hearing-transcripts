THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING. UNDER THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE E. CIGARETTE USE AMONG PEOPLE INCREASED BY ONE HUNDRED AND 35% IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE E. CIGARETTE USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE INCREASED BY ONE HUNDRED AND 35% THERE ARE NOW FIVE POINT THREE MILLION YOUNG AMERICANS. WHO USE E. CIGARETTES REGULARLY THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN YOUTH NICOTINE CONSUMPTION AND HAS BEEN DONE DECADES DECADES OF DECLINES OF YOUTH TOBACCO USE THE E. CIGARETTE INDUSTRY COPIED FROM THE BIG TOBACCO PLAYBOOK LAUREN YOUNG AND OUR KIDS WITH PERVASIVE MARKETING FALSE PROMISES AND KID FRIENDLY FLAVORS. COMPANIES LIKE JUL ABSOLVE THEMSELVES FROM RESPONSIBILITY BY DOWNPLAYING HOW ADDICTIVE AND DANGEROUS THEIR PRODUCTS ARE THE NICOTINE IN ONE JUL POT IS EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY CIGARETTES. JUL USED YOU FORMAT MODELS SLOGANS LIKE QUOTE GET INTO THE TROPICAL MOOD OF SUMMER WITH MANGO JEWEL POT. AND EVEN MARKETED TO KIDS ON SHOOL CAMPUSES. WALL TOOL IS THE MOST POPULAR E. CIGARETTE COMPANY THEY ARE HARDLY THE ONE THAT USES THESE TAX THE ONLY ONE THAT USES THESE TACTICS. FLAVORS LIKE BUBBLE GUM LEMON DROP IN FRUIT LOOPS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND PERVASIVELY MARKET. IT IS IMPORTANT UNDERSCORE THE EXPLOSION OF FLAVORED NICOTINE PRODUCTS IN THE ROLE THEY PLAY BOTH IN THIS EPIDEMIC. AND IN THE DICK DEAN NEW USERS WILL BIG TOBACCO ARGUES FLAVORS LIKE. A CRUNCHY CATER TO ADULT TASTES% COMMONSENSE AND DATA. TELL US OTHERWISE FLAVORS PLAY AN OUTSIZED AND DANGEROUS ROLE IN USED TOBACCO INITIATION. WITH TOBACCO STARTED WITH A FLAVORED PRODUCT AND AT LEAST REPEAT THAT. EIGHTY PERCENT. OF YOUTH WHO START SMOKING START WITH A FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF TEEN SMOKERS REPORT USING FLAVOR PRODUCTS. N. FLAVORED TOBACCO USE IS ACTUALLY HIGHER AMONG YOUTH THAN ADULTS MENTHOL CIGARETTES SWEETS CIGARS CANDY VAPES AND OTHER FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS ONLY SERVE TO MASK THE HARSHNESS OF TOBACCO AND GET USERS HOPE. TO A DEADLY LIFELONG ADDICTION. WHAT THE FDA HAS ESTABLISHED SOME RESTRICTIONS ON E. CIGARETTES THESE RULES ARE CLEAR IN A CLEAR WIN FOR JUL ULTRIUM AND BIG TOBACCO. THE FEDERAL RULES EXEMPT ALL MEN FULL FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES IN ONLY RESTRICTS FLAVORS IN SOME CARTRIDGE BASED E. CIGARETTES. LEAVING THOUSANDS OF FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES IN EVERY IMAGINABLE FLAVOR WIDELY AVAILABLE. THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY INTRODUCED THE NEXT NEW FAD. CHEAP DISPOSABLE E. CIGARETTES IN FLAVORS SUCH AS STRAWBERRY GRAPE AND MANGO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF PUFF BARS OF BARS AND ELECTRIC ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE THAT LOOKS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JUL DEVICES JUST ONE OF THE MANY KID FRIENDLY TOBACCO PRODUCTS EXEMPT UNDER FEDERAL RULES PUFF BARS COME IN EVERY FLAVOR IMAGINABLE ARE EASY TO CONCEAL AND ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE. I KNOW WE HAVE HAD TO ACT TO REASSESS. AND CHANGE OUR PRIORITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING COVERT NINETEEN EPIDEMIC. AT THE VERY LEAST TO THIS PANDEMIC REINFORCES THE NEED TO ESTABLISH STRONG TOBACCO CONTROL POLICY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO STOP SMOKING. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WARNS THE TOBACCO USE CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF SUFFERING THE MOST SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF COVERT NINETEEN. ADDITIONALLY MANY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS CAUTIONED THAT SMOKING PUTS PEOPLE AT INCREASED RISK OF CONTRACTING THE DISEASE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED BUT WE KNOW CONCLUSIVELY THAT SMOKING INCREASES RISK OF RESPIRATORY INFECTION WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IS A MAJOR UNDERLYING CAUSE OF LUNG DISEASE HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES. SB SEVEN NINETY THREE TAKE SWIFT ACTION TO PROTECT YOUTH AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS FROM FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE RETAIL SALE OF ALL FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS. OF FLAVORED TOBACCO PRODUCTS LIKE MENTHOL CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN USED FOR GENERATIONS AND I SEEN. TO DATE TARGET COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN LGBT Q. COMMUNITIES ADDING TO THE HEALTH DISPARITIES IN POPULATION ALREADY IMPACTED BY SOCIAL INEQUITIES. BIG TOBACCO WEAPONIZE THESE TACTICS TO LURE A NEW GENERATION TO NICOTINE ADDICTION IT IS TIME THAT WE BREAK THE CYCLE.

THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR- HILL I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK I WAS HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR LAST YEAR I AM HAPPY AND PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR THIS YEAR IT IS SHOCKING AND DISAPPOINTING TO ME THAT OUR STUDENTS AT OUR HIGH SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO. TO CHANGE VAPING AND HELP THEIR PEERS STAY SAFE AND THE ADULTS HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT IT IS SO CLEAR THE EVIDENCE IS SO CLEAR THA OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BABY BECAUSE OF THE FLAVORS THIS BILL TO ME IS PERFECT IF WE TAKE AWAY THE FLAVOR AND PEOPLE STILL ONE OF EIGHT THAT'S GREAT THEY CAN JUST TASTE THE TASTE OF THE NICOTINE. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO- CREATE A LIFELONG ADDICTION FOR OUR YOUTH WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THINGS THAT HELP OUR YOUTH TO BE THE BEST THEM THAT THEY CAN BE SO I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BRINGING IT OF FORWARD AGAIN HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I HOPE ALL OF US ADULTS CAN DO THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR YOUTH SO THAT THEY'RE NOT AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS AND- HI. TRYING TO FIX BUT WE COULDN'T FIX SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SAID EARLIER I THANK SUPPORT. THANK YOU US IN RUBIO. THANK YOU- I ALSO ON A SYSTEM OUT ONTO THE SENATORS COMMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HEAR OFTEN WOULD REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT'S BOTHERSOME TO ME AS I HEAR THAT IT'S NOT TARGETING OUR KIDS LAST YEAR I MEAN I WENT OUT TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND REALLY- FIGURE OUT HOW KIDS WERE GETTING THEIR HANDS ON THESE PRODUCTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND AND I ACTUALLY BODY FOR DISPLAY HERE. IS THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS FROM PENCILS STAPLERS- ON A YOU KNOW EVEN SHIRTS THAT HAD LITTLE TUBES THAT KIDS WOULD SMOKE IN THE LIBRARY IN THE LUNCH AREA AND W. FORMER TEACHER I ALSO TALKED TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES- IN SCHOOLS AND THEY SAID THAT THEY CAN KEEP TRACK ANYMORE BECAUSE KIDS WERE CORNERING THEMSELVES EITHER IN THE LIBRARY OR YOU KNOW IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE SCHOOLS. SO I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THEY'RE TARGETING OUR KIDS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THE SENATOR- LEVI'S CORRECT THAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT BY OUR KIDS AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO OKAY THANK YOU AYE SIR GROVE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR HELEN AND THEM. SO I JUST I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THEY'RE GOING TO BE IT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE CHAIR IS CAN INDULGE IT BUT- SO I. A BASED ON WHAT SENATOR RUBIO JUST SAID MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW- THESE PRODUCTS ARE LIKE HIDDEN THINGS LIKE- TENS OR OR- I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER THEY ARE THAT PLUGS INTO COMPUTERS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEIR THIRD THEY LOOK LIKE THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD THINK THEY LOOK LIKE IT'S IT LIKE A DISGUISE. AM I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT- I LOOK AT THESE THINGS LIKE FOR CANNABIS AND THEM YOU KNOW GUMMY BEARS LOLLY POPS COOKIES. THE ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE ARE HIDDEN THINGS AS WELL YOU KNOW LIKE GUMMY BEARS. LOOK LIKE CANDY TO KIDS. BUT THERE CANNABIS M. IT'S CANNABIS AND I NOTICE THAT. YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE INCREASE IN THE USAGE OF AB IN- FOR FLAVOR PRODUCTS BUT MARIJUANA LEGAL LEGALIZATION SINCE IT'S BEEN INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX- IT'S ROSY EXPOSURES WAS ABOUT A ON EXECUTIVE ORDER HE HIGHLIGHTED RATES OF YOUTH USE OF THE CIGARETTES AT TEN POINT FOUR PERCENT. AND WHILE CANNABIS WAS AT FOURTEEN POINT DATA SHOWS THAT CANNABIS IS MORE- AFFECTING OUR YOUTH MORE THAN WHAT THE E. CIGARETTE FLAVORS ARE. AND SO I GUESS GIVEN THAT THE CDC IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED THAT THE RECENT LUNG INFECTION AND THE OUTBREAK OUR OUR TTC VAPING PRODUCTS AND WE'RE NOT USING THAT ARGUMENT FOR THIS ANYMORE- IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THE CANNABIS RATES. THAT AFFECTED ARE YOU SHOULD BE MORE ALARMING DâN AND- THEN-WHAT THESE LABOR EAT CIGARETTES ARE DOING SO AS- CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT- BE HAPPY TO LISTEN TO GROW THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND- I GUESS WHAT WE LOOK AT IN THIS BILL IS CONCENTRATED ON. THE PREVALENCE AND THE DEVASTATING EFFECT OF TOBACCO AND NICOTINE ADDICTION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADDICTION OR THE ADDICTIVE ASPECTS OF CANNABIS. OR ALCOHOL WE FIND THAT 31% OF TOBACCO USERS TO DEVELOP DEPENDENCE ON TOBACCO SO IT'S A VERY ADDICTIVE. PRODUCT THAT- CERTAINLY CONTROLS THEIR LIFE AFTER THAT ADDICTION BUT WE'RE AS- A DEPENDENT ON TOBACCO COMPARED TO FIFTEEN POINT 5% FOR. THE WHOLE YOU. ONLY AND ONE. ASIAN ONLY EVEN THOUGH IT SIGNIFICANT. BECOME ADDICTED TO THE PRODUCT SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MOST. PREVALENT THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND THE MOST ADDICTIVE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET TODAY. TO PREVENT- THAT TYPE OF ADDICTION BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO HAVE- YOU KNOW DR- HELP INFILL SURE IF- YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE MORE. THE EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF THE ADDICTION AND THE NEED FOR. TOBACCO FLAVOR PROHIBITION RATHER THAN THE CANNABIS ISSUE. OKAY OKAY HELLO DOES MAKE NOTE GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS OF SIR GROW WOULD IT BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO HEAR FROM DOCTOR ABOUT THIS OR NOT. EAT WHAT YOU CAN YOU JUST HAPPENS TO MY OFFICE BECAUSE THE CHURCH CONCERNED HAPPY TO. CATCH I AGREE WITH THAT IDEA THANK YOU SO I'M I ALSO KNOW THAT. I'M YEAH I KEEP THINKING HOW WE- THESE TWO IN. IN THE CAMPUS INDUSTRY IS GETTING  TAX REDUCTION AND THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THAT REQUIRES A TAX INCREASE ON IN THE BUT AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S COMING OUT. AND THEY'VE DISCUSSED A TAX INCREASE ON- THESE E. CIGARETTE PRODUCTS. AND THEY'RE ESTIMATING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PRIDE SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX LOSSES IF THIS BILL PASSES. SO THAT CREATES A BUDGET ISSUE THAT WE HAVE- AS WELL. I JUST THINK THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY- INSTEAD OF BANNING OR DECIMATED AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY. WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR I DON'T KNOW FEES FOR HIGHER ON THE YOU KNOW FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT SELL TO MINORS A PARENT SOMETIMES AT SOME TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY- IN. BUT WE'VE GOT TO STOP ATTACKING THE PRIVATE BUSINESS INDUSTRY. IS I GUESS MY ISSUE. I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS. I GUESS I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GROCER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SORT OF PAN FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO A KNOWLEDGE ARE CHEERING EVERYONE HERE OUR NEW SET UP YOU NOT YOU SAID TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS HAVING TO KIND OF ALL THE JUST. TO OUR NEW. CLIMATE IN WHICH WE ARE DOING POLICY MAKING SO LET ME CHECK MY HAVE TO EVERYONE WHO'S MADE THIS POSSIBLE IT SEEMS TO BE GOING. SEEMS TO ME THAT THE- THE SCREEN THE SWITCH IN AND IT'S ALL WORKING FOR THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN- SENATOR HE'LL JUST A QUICK QUESTION- BASED ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT WITH REGARD TO FOCUS ON THE BALLOT IN THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF WHO COULD YOU TALK TO ME COULD YOU TELL% ME WHY YOU'VE CHOSEN NOT TO AMENDED OUT OF THE BILL I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US ALL TO NOW. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL AND YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE AND I THINK WE CAN ALL APRECIATE THE CULTURAL COMPONENT OF HOOKAHS. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. BUT AT THIS POINT AT THIS STAGE I HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME UNDERSTANDING. THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF HAVING FLAVORS. LIKE WHITE GUMMY BEAR OR RED GUMMY BEAR OR YOU MAY WANT COCOA JUMBO OR SEX ON THE BEACH. PIRATES CAVER BUBBLE GUM. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE HAT I'M LOOKING AT- IN TERMS OF EXEMPTING. A PARTICULAR CULTURAL BECAUSE I HAVE TO STRUGGLING WITH THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE FLAVORS. I HATE THAT SO THE- COMMENT. SAFE SO YOUR BILL WOULD NOT STOP. HOOKAH LOUNGES ARE THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO. SMOKE HOOKAH FROM DOING SELL IT WOULD ONLY STOP THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE FLAVORED PRODUCTS THAT'S CORRECT A BIG IN THE FLAVORED PRODUCT WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE JUST AS THEY WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER TOBACCO CIGARETTES IT UP YOU CAN PURCHASE THEM ONLINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER MINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO JUST WANT TO AND MINE. THANKS TO THE STAFF PREPARATION IN SUPPORT FOR TODAY IN IN THE PUBLIC SUPPORT AS WELL FOR. MOVING FORWARD A AND THANKS TO THE CHAIR FOR YOUR STAFF AN ACCOMMODATION AS FAR THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I FULLY INTENDED TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I WAS BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE SENATOR MITCHELL. I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS- IN MY DISTRICT SENATOR RUBIO REFERENCE SOME OF THE- SMUGGLING DEVICES USED IN SCHOOLS- ALSO THUMB DRIVES FOR COMPUTERS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A THUMB DRIVE THAT'S ACTUALLY- FOR VAPING- I'VE HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT USED TO- SUSPEND STUDENTS WHEN THEY WERE CAUGHT WITH VAPING PRODUCTS. THEY WERE LOSING TOO MUCH EIGHTY A MONEY BECAUSE OF THE PREVALENCEIN SO STUDENTS WERE SENT TO STUDY HALLS AFTER THE EQUIPMENT WAS CONFISCATED. QUICK QUESTION IS THE USE OF VAPING MATERIAL. LEGAL FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. NO IT'S NOT LEGAL THE MARKETING TARGETS USE FROM IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AGE YOUTH MOST OF WHOM ARE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. SO IT'S AN ILLEGAL PRODUCT FOR THEM TO POSSESS ALREADY BUT THE MARKETING CONTINUES LEADING WITH THE FLAVORS TO APPEAL TO CHILDREN IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE- THE HISTORY OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY AND HOW THEY MARKET TO YOUTH AND- A- AND A X. TWO OF THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN THEIR FLAVORED TOBACCO IS EVEN BY OFFERING AT A LOWER PRICE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT'S MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR THEM TO THEN BECOME ADDICTED- I DON'T THINK WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THOSE WHO- USED. FOR TASTE I MEAN I TRY TO FIGURE OUT I THINK I WAS THIRTEEN AND NOTHING TASTED SO BAD I NEVER PICKED UP ANOTHER ONE. BUT HAD IT TASTED LIKE BUBBLE GUM OR SEX ON THE BEACH AND WITH THAT TASTES LIKE BUT IT- IT COULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE TO SOMEONE- SO HITS- I AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE FIND WITH THE YOUTH MARKET IS THE FLAVOR BECOMES ATTRACTIVE IN THE NAMES MAKE IT. MORE ENTICING AND THEN THEY BECOME ADDICTED AND IS IT ACCURATE TO SUGGEST THAT. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO TAKE UP VAPING WITH FLAVORED PRODUCTS ARE NOT SEEKING TO RECOVER FROM. A PRIOR TOBACCO ADDICTION FROM CIGARETTES. THIS IS THEIR ON RAMP THERE ON RAMP AND 80% OF THEM START WITH A FLAVORED PRODUCT. AND THEN AFTER THE WHAT WE FIND IS THAT ONCE THEY BECOME ADDICTED THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE FLAVOR IS THEY NEED THE FIX AND THEY NEED THE NICOTINE. AND THEY DON'T BEST THAT WHAT WE FOUND WITH EIGHTEEN AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE EAST BRANCH IT'S NOT JUST USING IT TO TRANSITION OFF OF TOBACCO IS THEY BECOME ADDICTED AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TRANSITION TO REGULAR TOBACCO CIGARETTES. SO IT ACTUALLY WORKS A PERVERT. THANK YOUNG AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ON THE IN. I WILL BE SUPPORT THE BILL TO THANK YOU. OKAY YOU WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO A TIME CHECK WE'RE SO ON OUR FIRST ITEM AND IT IS TEN OH SEVEN CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS STILL GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ONLINE. AND SO EASY SO THE FAVORITES AT THE FLAVOR PRODUCT WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE TO PERK. SO HOW DO WE STOP STUDENTS OR CHILDREN FROM GETTING IT ONLINE. WELL LEGISLACIóN I HAD LAST YEAR SB THIRTY NINE REQUIRES NOW THE TOBACCO. SALE OF TOBACCO ONLINE OR DELIVERY OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IS TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN ALCOHOL SALES ONLINE. THAT PRODUCT HAS TO BE PACKAGED IN A- CONTINUOUS IN A IN A WAY IN A MANNER THAT IDENTIFIES IT AS A TOBACCO PRODUCT ALSO IDENTIFIES IT IT'S REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED TO SOMEONE OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. AND A SIGNATURE IS REQUIRED UPON DELIVERY. TO THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ALCOHOL. SO IF YOU HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE TO VAPE AND YOU HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE TO DRINK ALCOHOL. WE'RE NOT BANNING ALCOHOL AND STUDENTS AND CHILDREN STILL HAVE AN ADDICTION TO ALCOHOL AND THEY STILL PURCHASE ALCOHOL. I JUST SEE THAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ONLINE THE ONLY THING THAT WE DO IS RE REDUCE- AGAIN THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT SELL THIS PRODUCT THEY ASK FOR AN ID WHEN THEY COME INTO THE STORE. AND OBVIOUSLY ONLINE YOU CAN- IT BE EASIER TO MISREPRESENT WHO YOU ARE TO PURCHASE IT. BUT IT WOULD ALSO- DIDN'T THEN GOING INTO ONE OF THESE PLACES OBVIOUSLY BUT TWELVE YEAR OLD GOES INTO A STORE THEY CAN IDENTIFY THAT PERSON IMMEDIATELY IS A TWELVE YEAR OLD. THEY'RE NOT GONNA SELLING THE PRODUCT OR THE SHOULD NOT SOME THE PRODUCT AND IT'S ILLEGAL SOUND PRODUCT. BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW A TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEAR OLD IS GOING TO JUST GO ONLINE AND ORDER IT- I MEAN MY TEN YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER IS BETTER ON A COMPUTER THAN I AM. WELL THAT WOULD BE FINE WITH THE IDEA. THEN THAT PERSON WHO RECEIVES THAT PRODUCT- THAT TOBACCO PRODUCT OR THAT ALCOHOL PRODUCT AT THE DOOR. OR WHEREVER TO RECEIVE HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HAS TO SIGN FOR THAT. THAT PRODUCT OF YOUR TWELVE YEARS OLD I DON'T THINK YOU COULD PASS FOR TWENTY ONE. AT BY THE- UPS DRIVER THE FED EX DRIVER THAT'S REQUIRED TO. TO REQUIRE THAT SIGNATURE AND IDENTIFICATION. AND I'M JUST I'M NOT TRYING TO ARGUE WITH YOU BUT I JUST SEE THAT. IF YOU'RE ALREADY REQUIRED TO BE TWENTY ONE TO PURCHASE SAID AT A STORE- SO. IN PEOPLE ARE STILL DOING IT SO IT'LL IS NOT. I DON'T MEAN TO BE OUR YEAH I DON'T EITHER BUT- MISTER CHAIR THAT THE- THAT HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM. WITH ALCOHOL SALES. AND THAT'S WHY WE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO APPLY THAT SAME REQUIREMENT. TO TOBACCO SALES. I JUST THINK AM AGAIN VOICING MY OPPOSITION IN THE BILL. A BECAUSE I THINK IT DECIMATES A LOT OF- BUSINESSES IT READ AND IT OBVIOUSLY IS A CULTURAL ISSUE. AS WELL- AND- IT OBVIOUSLY IS VERY IMPACTFUL TO A CERTAIN PARTICULAR CULTURE. AND THAT IT ALSO DECIMATES THE KNOWN- THE ONLY TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE. BUT THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE OF STUDENTS GETTING A HOLD OF THIS PRODUCT- WITHOUT DECIMATING AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY- SO THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A QUICK FOLLOW P I JUST DO NOT THINK THAT WE CAN SELL OUR CHILDREN SOUL. FOR MONEY. AND IF THIS IS STRICTLY ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEN BEING ABLE TO SELL IT. THEN WE ARE SAYING THAT MAKING MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT. THAN THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN AND I THINK THA'S FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG. SO I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. SEEN OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. TING I JUST WANT TO SAY CENTER HELL OF A THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR ON THE BILL. I AND WE NEED TO. WORK TO TRY TO REDUCE- TOBACCO EXPOSURE VERTICALLY NICOTINE EXPOSURE- TO OUR USE. AND SO WHAT I CAN WHAT THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING DIED DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE. IT WOULD IF I COULD MISS RICHARD FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES- TURNER WITHIN THE GOVERNOR. AND OTHER DOCTOR AND OUR STUDENTS TO WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE LINE TODAY AS OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WELL I CAN UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT TO THE BONUSES TO THIS BILL OF MADE I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE BIGGER PICTURE. WITH TOBACCO USE BEING THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH AND DISEASE WE ALSO NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES. OF A NEW GENERATION HOOKED TO NICOTINE. THIRTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY DUE TO TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESSES AND- THAT I CANNOT SEE IF THERE'S ANY REASON THAT THE MOST DEADLY PRODUCT. ON EARTH NEEDS TO HAVE A CANDY FLAVOR. I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL MEMBERS. I THANK YOU SENATOR HELLO. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS THIS BILL IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR MITCHELL. PASSED SENATORS THAT YOU PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONE BEFORE YOU CAST YOUR VOTE SO WE HAVE A CLEAR RECORD OF YOUR VOTE. A SECRETARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CAN I AND I MALES.

OKAY PART FOR ME GOING MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SINCE I NUMBER THREE IS MINE AND THEY ALWAYS GO AT THE END SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE BY CENTER WIENER I THOUGHT I THINK I SEE HIM IN THE ROOM IT'S USUALLY HARD TO MISS SOME. YES THERE OKAY. SO. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE DUGGAR YES THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MYDOCTOR THANK YOU YEAH AND- YEAH SO WELCOME AND- PLEASE BEGIN YOUR- PRESENTATION ON SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE. GREAT I THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR IN THIS BILL AND I WANNA. FIRST START BY THANKING THE CHAIR- AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH US ON THIS BILL- TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE- WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED. AMENDMENTS AND WE ALSO INDICATED WITH REMOVING BUT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ARE FROM THE BILL. I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION. FOR THE HARD WORK OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS INCLUDING. A HEALTH ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE BILL WHETHER THEY SUPPORT. OR OPPOSE. BY CALLING SENATE BILL A FIFTY FIVE. ON WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN ENSURING. THAT CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS PARITY WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE. TO THE WE START TREATING. MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION TERROR AS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN PHYSICAL CARE. WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS A CORE PART. OF HUMAN HEALTH AND THAT. NOT COVERING IT CREATE HUGE PROBLEMS WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE THAT FOR EXIST TO COVER NINETEEN. AND WE KNOW THAT CO IN NINETEEN WILL MAKE A BAD SITUATION WORSE AS PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. ISOLATION TO SPARE FROM THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE AND FROM ILLNESS AND ALL OF THE CHANGES NEGATIVE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING. THAT WE KNOW WILL IMPACT PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH. AND THAT WE KNOW WHAT IMPACT ADDICTION IN FACT IN MY OWN COMMUNITY I AM ALREADY REGULARLY HEARING. ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN RECOVERY FOR EXAMPLE FOR MATH. WHO WERE NOW RELAPSING AND WE ARE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE HAS JUST BECOME. EVEN MORE ACUTE. AND SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE- DOES JUST A COUPLE OF VERY BASIC THINGS. FIRST OF ALL IT MAKES CLEAR. THAT INSURANCE MUST COVER ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE NOT JUST A SUBSET THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT FROM THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES WAS A BIG STEP BUT IT'S LIMITED TO ONLY NINE. MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS IT DOES NOT COVER SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND IT LEAVES OUT SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANCE- THE RELEASE A SIGNIFICANT- MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING PTSD ANXIETY DISORDER OPIOID USE DISORDER ALCOHOL USE DISORDER STIMULANT DISORDER BINGE EATING DISORDER AND MAJOR NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER DUE TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY THOSE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT LEAVES OUT. AND RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL ONLY COVER MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE. IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN CRISIS SO YOU'RE ALREADY ON YOUR WAY TO THE SITE EMERGENCY ROOM YOU MAY BE ALREADY LOST YOUR JOB AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HOUSING. AND THEN YOU GET TREATMENT ARE YOU ONLY GET A FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL YOU STABILIZE. THIS IS REALLY SIMILAR TO SAYING WE KNOW YOU HAVE STAGE ONE CANCER. IT'S NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH YET. COME BACK AND SEE US FOR COVERAGE WHEN YOU'RE AT STAGE FOR WE WOULD LAUGH. THE INSURANCE COMPANY OUT OF THE ROOM NO ONE. WOULD ACCEPT THAT AND YET WE HAVE BEEN ACCEPTING A- WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION. AND IT'S NOT OKAY AND WE SEE IT PLAY OUT ON OUR STREETS. AND WE SEE IT PLAY OUT. WHO HAVE HOUSING BUT ARE SUFFERING QUIETLY. AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING QUIETLY. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS AND NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE TO BOURBON ALCESTE WAS VERY THOROUGH APPROACH TO THIS BILL SHOWS THAT THIS WILL HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT. ON PREMIUMS BUT IT WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. AND WITH RESPECT TO COVER NINETEEN I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING REPORT CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY. ESTIMATING THAT UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND AMERICANS. ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE WHAT WE CALL DEATH FOR THE SPARE. DEATH BY SUICIDE BY DRUG OVERDOSE. BY ALCOHOLISM BECAUSE THE CURVE IN NINETEEN. NORMALLY ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND AMERICANS DIE EACH YEAR DUE TO DEATH BY THE SPARE. THAT COULD ALMOST DOUBLE BECAUSE THE CURVE IN NINETEEN SO NOW IS THE TIME TO INTERVENE TO STABILIZE THIS UNSTABLE HEALTH SITUATION. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MY WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OUR DAVID LLOYD WHO'S A SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH THE KENNEDY FORM.

OKAY WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ENTIRE TO AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FOR MUCH MODERATOR. A LET'S MOVE ON TO THE- BUT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION ALEX BEGAN AXES HERE IN THIS ROOM- LAKE LOUISE US. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS I GUESS YOU SHOULD STILL FORMALLY INTRODUCE YOURSELF AT THE MICROPHONE HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- NICK LOUISE US WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS- RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SB EIGHT FIVE FIVE- MEMBERS A CAP GENERALLY OPPOSES AT NEW BENEFIT MANDY DEALS BECAUSE EITHER INCREMENTALLY OR EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE COST OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES EMPLOYERS- WELL IN OUR VIEW- IT'S NEVER A GOOD TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE PREMIUMS- IT IS AN ESPECIALLY COMPLICATED AND CHALLENGING TIME TO BE DURING SO AT THIS TIME. I'M HEALTH PLANS- IN ADDITION TO THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE WORKING HARD TO MANAGE THE FALLOUT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC INCLUDING DEALING WITH RESPONSIBILITY OF JUGGLING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE COST OF COVERED NINETEEN. AND THE PENCIL TO MAN FOR HEALTH SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY. MANY BILLS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THIS BROADER CONTEXT HAVING SAID THIS- OUR PLANS ARE DEDICATED TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND- WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT MANY OF OUR PLANS ARE DOING DOING A DURING THIS CRISIS. AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THE TEACHER BURKE ANALYSIS DOES. CONFIRM THAT ALMOST 1100% OF ENROLLEES RECEIVE COVERAGE IS FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THIS BILL ALREADY- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE LONG TERM CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA AND WE MUST DEAL WITH THEM COLLECTIVELY. ENSURING OUR STATE HAS THE TOOLS AND PEOPLE NEEDED TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS SERVICES IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. OUR BIGGEST OUTLINED HIS- OUTLINED IN THE YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION REPORTS FOR WHICH STATES THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE 50% FEWER PSYCHIATRISTS. IN 20% FEWER PSYCHOLOGISTS. ENGINE FAMILY THERAPIST AND LICENSED COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. REGRET REGRETTABLY THIS BILL DOES NOT MEET THIS PARTICULAR CHALLENGE HEAD ON BUT TAKES THE APPROACH OF MAKING THIS A COVERAGE ISSUE ONLY. BY MANDATING COVERAGE FOR ALL THREE HUNDRED PLUS CONDITIONS AND IN THE CURRENT EDITION OF THE DSM. IN DOING O IN A WAY THAT WE BELIEVE IN RAVEL'S OF MANAGED CARE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS AN APPROACH THAT WE FEEL IS FRAUGHT WITH AN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES BY DEFINING MEDICAL NECESSITY IN A WAY THAT DIMINISHES PAYER OVERSIGHT AND CHECKS AND BALANCES. IT UNDERMINES PROVIDER NETWORKS BY DISCOURAGING PROVIDERS TO CONTRACTING JOIN A HEALTH PLAN THAT WORKS. AND SPECIFICALLY THE BILL DOES SO BY REQUIRING IMMEDIATE COVERAGE FOR OUT OF NETWORK CARE VIA TIME CORTICAL CONTINUITY OF CARE PROVISIONS EXCEED THOSE FOUND IN LAW FOR OTHER SERVICES THERE FOR CREATING DISPARITY BETWEEN. THE HEALTH OF THE REAL SERVICES SIDE. AND IT IS ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT DISCRETE SERIES QUALITY OF CARE CONCERNS PLANS ARE BARRED FROM TO TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS FOR INTERRUPTING A COURSE OF TREATMENT. BY OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS FOR ALMOST ANY REASON. THIS PLACE PATIENTS AT RISK. AS IT WOULD LIVE IN A PLANS ABILITY TO TRANSITION INTO REALLY TO AN IN NETWORK. FACILITY FOR WHICH THEY WOULD RECEIVE THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED UNDER CONTRACTS- INCLUDING QUALITY OF CARE ASSURANCES. SO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL STOP THERE AND- JUST STATE THAT CAP RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES BILL AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. AND I BELIEVE- THERE'S ANOTHER WITNESS- FROM THE OKAY HERE ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT YET PRESS AND YOUNG FROM THE CAL CHAMBER I HAVE TO THE DO YOU TOTAL WILL GET THREE MINUTES AND NEXT KILEY USED ALL THE- MOST OF THE TIME THAT- END OF YOU GUYS COORDINATED OR NOT BUT- I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO GIVE A BRIEF STATEMENTS AND THE OTHER A MINUTE IF THAT'S OKAY CENTER.

THANK YOU- AND THE AMENDMENTS DO ASSUAGE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD UNFORTUNATELY AS MR LOUISE'S WAS ALLUDING TO THE CONCERN THAT STILL EXISTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE PREMIUM INCREASES DUE TO THE- THE BENEFIT MANDATE. COVER CALIFORNIA CAME OUT WITH AN ANALYSIS INDICATING THAT PREMIUMS NEXT YEAR MAY INCREASE THE ECHO THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN EXPENSES- THEIR CURRENT TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN YOU TAKE THAT IN CONJUNCTION ITH THE CURRENT BUSINESS CLIMATE WERE BUSINESSES ARE DEALING WITH THE DIFFICULTY IN UNCERTAINTY KEEPING THEIR DOORS OPEN AND THEN YOU'RE LAYERING ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS AND EXPENSES ON TOP OF INCREASING EXPENSES IN PREMIUMS. IT IS A DIFFICULT- STORM TO WEATHER SO- FOR THESE REASONS I DO UNDERSTAND IT IS A AN INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE TOPIC AND ONE THAT HITS CLOSER TO HOME THAN I WISH AND- I AM RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. EIGHTY THANK YOU FOR. ITS FOR MUCH. OTHER WITNESS. AND HEARING ROOM FORTY TWO THOUGH THREE. ST NINE LET'S MOVE TO HEARING ROOM TWENTY FORTY.

ATTEMPTING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON AND SO OUR LGBTQ LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS DECIDED IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE BILL AND FRIENDS- DUE TO CREATE SOME- TIME SENSITIVITIES AND-YOU IN YOURSELF REALLY WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH US. AND WE'RE AND THE AMENDMENTS- THAT THE THAT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSING- MAKE THIS BILL BETTER BILL IN A STRONGER BILL FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT- THE MOMENTS THAT I WANT TO. LIVE I THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO BE AN AMAZING ALLY TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY- BECAUSE THIS BILL IS SOMETHING A BILL THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE- INTRODUCING. OR CONSIDERING. ON THE FACT THAT THE- OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS COUNTIES INCLUDING MY OWN COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO INCLUDING LOS ANGELES COUNTY TWENTY SOME OF THE LARGEST. A COUNTY THAT'LL LARGEST LGBTQ POPULATIONS IN THE WORLD. ARE NOT COLLECTING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND HEALTH IMPACTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WITH RESPECT TO CODE MOST TIME SENSITIVE BUT RISK REFER TO ALL OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AS WELL. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DATA IT SEEMS SOMETIMES IT GOES OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS A LITTLE BORING IT'S NOT VERY SEXY. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH COVERT NINETEEN RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE SEE. THAT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS CHEST APPALLING. DEATH RATES. FROM THIS PANDEMIC. SO DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WHEN WE SEE pNEXT COMMUNITY THAT IN MY OWN COMMUNITY IN THE MISSION WHERE THEY TESTED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK. AND THE LIGHT MAX. PERCENTAGE OF THOSE TESTS WERE UNDER FIFTY PERCENT. BUT THE POSITIVE. FOR THE TESTING WITH 95% MY NECK'S. WE SEE THE HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG AGE GROUPS AMONG GENDERS THE WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR JOBS THAT THEY HAVE MANY MORE LIKELY TO GET VERY SICK. WELL WE KNOW ALL THIS ONLY BECAUSE WE ASK PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET TESTED WHEN THEY GET TREATED. WHAT IS YOUR RACE WHAT IS YOUR GENDER WHAT IS YOUR AGE PEOPLE ARE REQUIRED TO ANSWER BUT THEY NORMALLY O. AND WE OBTAIN IN VALUABLE DATA THAT HELPS US FOCUS RESOURCES ON EDUCATION ON AL REACH. WHEN HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE. ON MAKING SURE THAT ONE AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN SHOWS UP IN THE HOSPITAL HE'S NOT DISMISSED AS JUST COMPLAINING THAT IT'S JUST AS REAL AS IF A MIDDLE CLASS WHITE WOMAN SHOWS UP. WE LEARN WE LEARN ABOUT THE OVERCROWDING IN THE LIVE NEXT COMMUNITY AND SO MANY OF OUR CITIES. WE LEARN ABOUT THESE RISKS FROM DATA AND YET AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE. DECIDED NOT TO COLLECT THIS DATA FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. BUT I WOULD SAY KNOW WHERE THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE COLLECTING A- WE'RE NOT DOING IT IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THE LGBT COMMUNITY HAS HIGH IN HEALTH RISKS HIGHER RATES OF HIV CERTAIN KINDS OF CANCER OF SMOKING OF HOMELESSNESS THESE ARE ALL RISK FACTORS FOR CODE RED. WE NEED TO COLLECT THE DATA THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THAT CITY PH CHANGE ITS DATABASE. TO DO THAT THAT THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE DATABASES WILL HAVE TO CHANGE IT AND THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO ASK FOR THIS VOLUNTARY INFORMATION NO ONE WILL BE FORCED TO ANSWER. AND THAT WE WILL HAVE THE DATA FINALLY WE HAVE DONE A MILLION TESTS IN CALIFORNIA WE LOST AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE NEXT MILLION TESTS. I HAVE THIS INFORMATION I WOULD LOVE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND DO THIS IMMEDIATELY- WE NEED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND THEN ULTIMATELY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IDOL AND WITH ME DIGITAL AIR FLOW A TESTIFIED. ARE A RICK SUPER THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA OUR SPONSOR AND THE MAN THE WALL THERE WITH THE LGBTQ HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. NETWORK REMOVE THE BILL.

YES SIR HE BERMAN THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA ALL RIGHT SOMEONE TO GO AHEAD BEGIN. YOU KNOW TODAY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WILL BE TESTED FOR CODE NINETEEN BUT WE WON'T KNOW THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF THE GENDER IDENTITY UP A SINGLE ONE. WE WON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN OUTBREAK IN THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY IN ANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS OR ANYWHERE IN OUR STATE AND WHEN THERE IS WE WON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO DETECT THOSE OUTBREAKS BUT YOU WERE TECH TO HELP WITH LGBT Q. PEOPLE. IN RECENT WEEKS THERE'S BEEN IMPORTANT REPORTING ON EIGHT HOW THE RATES WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AMONG OUR ELDERS AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES GENERALLY THREE OR FOUR OR MORE TIMES HIGHER THAN AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT YOU CAN TAKE STEPS REJECT ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE'RE GATHERING AND REPORTING THIS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT LGBT Q. PLUS PEOPLE ALSO EXPERIENCE HEALTH AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT SIGNALED EXTREME RISK FOR CODED RELATED FATALITY. EVERY TO SMOKING I'M UN COMPROMISE HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY TODAY OUR DATA IS NOT BEING COLLECTED AT TESTING SITES ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE EVEN NEED THIS BILL AND THE LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE NEED TO PLEAD WITH OUR GOVERNMENT ONCE AGAIN TO TAKE VERY BASIC STEPS TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH. IT LGBT Q. PEOPLE ARE LEFT OUT OF THE DATA THAT OUTBREAKS CAN'T BE DETECTED AND DEATHS WON'T BE PREVENTED THAT'S NOT CONJECTURE IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE THE TRUTH.

SENATOR IENER JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS BILL TO VERY- IMPORTANT BILL ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMMUNITY- NOT ONLY STANDARDIZING THE DATA BUT I REMEMBER IN THE CITY COUNCIL IN LONG BEACH BEING ABLE TO ADD THAT QUESTION ON FOR THE HOMELESS SENSES THAT WE WERE TAKING AND HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR ADDITIONAL GANTS BECAUSE WE'VE FOUND THE STATED TO BE SO VALUABLE. WHAT I WOULD JUST ALSO MENTION IN THE BILL IS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE A CITY LIKE LONG BEACH HAS ITS OWN HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE SPECIAL WITH A LARGE POPULATION OF LGBT Q. CALIFORNIANS THERE THAT THOSE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ALSO PART OF THIS- INFORMATION AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO DISAGGREGATED DATA BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY NOW AS YOU KNOW PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE.

COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL- I WANT TO THANK GOD THE HEALTH OFFICERS FOR WORKING WITH US WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM- AND ALSO A PROPOSED BY CENTER GONZALEZ IS COMMON. OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE COVER ALL OUR BASES. WE KNOW THAT THE STATE SET UP THE STRUCTURE WITH A STATEWIDE. DATABASE AND REPORTING. THEY'RE ALSO COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE STATE DATABASE THAT'S LA AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR. OTHER COUNTIES LIKE MY OWN. USE THE STATE DATABASE AND ALSO HAVE A COUNTY DATABASE. ON DEREK COUNTIES WHERE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ENTER DATA INTO THE DATABASE DIRECTLY. IN OTHER COUNTIES ONLY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. ENTERS THE DATA SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROVIDERS. ARE COLLECTING THE DATA WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY COLLECTING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THAT TO THE EXTENT THE COUNTIES HAVE A ROLE THAT THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO ENTER THE DATA IF IT DOES FLOW THROUGH THEM SO YOU DON'T HAVE COUNTY TO SAY. WE'LL DO REYES DATA BUT WE DON'T WANT TO DO OF THE TWO THAT A- AND THEN OF COURSE AT THE STATE DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO WE THINK OF THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. LIKELY DOES ALL THAT. BUT AS I DISCUSSED WITH THE CHAIR YESTERDAY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE HEALTH OFFICERS TO FIGURE OUT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE COVERING THE FIELD AND- CLICK THE IF WE NEED ANY. FIREMEN IT'S GOING DOWN THE ROAD. I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. OUR GOVERNOR NEW SON AND WITH DOCTOR ANGEL FROM C. P. H. R. THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN A- LONG TERM AMAZING ALLIED OUR COMMUNITY WE'VE SPOKEN IN DIRECTLY. HE GOT TO TALK TO ANGEL GOT TO- WE WANT TO SEE THINGS MOVE A NEW FASTER- AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK VERY COLLABORATIVELY. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL.

THE FROM THERE'S THEY'RE SITTING- SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE CONSTANTLY MOVING BACK AND THREE WHITE TO SELL WITH THE SIR MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER. AND MEMBER. I'D LIKE TO START BIKES THE CEERS MM AND IT ALSO LIKE TO THINK TERRY BOWDEN FOR ALL OF HER HARD WORK ON THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE CHAIR IN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. MEMBERS AS THE WORLD RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS ACCESS TO PROVIDERS AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE IS NOW MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER. AT THE SAME TIME THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CREATED ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STRAINS ON BOTH HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS. MAKING THESE PROVIDERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO AND PERHAPS AMENABLE TO CONSOLIDATION ATTEMPTS BY LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT CONSOLIDATION AFFILIATION ACQUISITION MERGER OR ANY OTHER SPECIFIC ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS HOWEVER EXISTING LAW PROVIDES LITTLE OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION AND MARK TO MARKET PRACTICES OF FOR PROFIT ENTITIES. LEFT LARGELY UNCHECKED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO GROW AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO UTILIZE ABUSE OF MARKET PRACTICES THAT CAN DRIVE UP PRICES IN REDUCE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF ACQUISITION OF MERGERS INVOLVING NONPROFIT ENTITIES IN MY DISTRICT I'VE HAD HOSPITAL ACQUISITIONS INVOLVING BOTH SECTORS. THE NONPROFIT ACQUISITION UNDER THE REVIEW OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GUARANTEED CONTINUED OPERATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AND OTHER SERVICES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. IN ANOTHER PART OF MY DISTRICT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL SERVING A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WAS ACQUIRED BY A HEDGE FUND A GROUP WITH NO REVIEW BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND NO COMMITMENTS TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF BASIC SERVICES TO THE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY. SB NINE SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NOW AND IF LEAGUE ASIAN AND OR ACT. BETWEEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN ANY OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITY OR PROVIDER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD CONSENT OR DENY THE AFFILIATION OR ACQUISITION BASED ON TWO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FACTORS FIRST WHETHER THE TRANSACTION WOULD INCREASE CARE COORDINATION AND OR AFFORDABILITY OF CARE TO AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. AND SECOND WHETHER THE TRANSACTION IS SUBSTANTIALLY LIKELY TO RESULT IN ANTI COMPETITIVE OF X. THAT AT WELL A IN ANY OF THE BENEFITS. IF THE ACQUISITION OR AFFILIATION DOES NOT MEET EITHER OF THESE REQUIREMENTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY DENY THE TRANSACTION. AT THIS TIME WE ESTIMATE ONLY THIRTEEN LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WOULD FALL UNDER THIS REVIEW PROCESS. THIS ANALYSIS COULD CHANGE ADDITIONALLY SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN WOULD DECLARE THAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT EXERCISE SUBSTANTIAL MARKET POWER ME KNIGHTON GAUGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT LIKELIHOOD OF ANTI COMPETITIVE IMPACTS. ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR SIR TO FIND TO INCLUDE INCREASING MARKET PRICES DIMINISHING QUALITY OF CARE REDUCING CHOICE INCREASING THE TOTAL COST OF CARE OR DIMINISHING ACCESS TO OR AVAILABILITY OF HOSPITAL OR NON HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. EIGHTY NINE SEVEN SEVEN ALSO ESTABLISHES THE HEALTH POLICY ADVISORY BOARD LED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE BOARD WOULD EVALUATE AND ANALYZE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE MARKETS IN UPON REQUEST BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE BOARD REVIEW HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS REQUEST FOR AFFILIATION OR ACQUISITION. THE BOARD WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF BUSINESSES MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES. THE BOARD MIR'S MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY OFFICE THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. IF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD I AM OPEN TO REMOVING THE ADVISORY BOARD PROVISIONS FROM S. B. NINE SEVEN SEVEN. MEMBERS AS COVERT NINETEEN IMPACTS ARE FORCING CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN INSURERS RESPONSIBLE OVERSIGHT OF THE GROWTH OF LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. MEMBERS I'D NOW LIKE TO PRESENT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- JENNY PHILIP SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO ATTORNEY GENERAL FIVE YEAR PESETA.

THANK YOU AS THE MORNING TO AND CAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNY PHILLIPS AND I AM THE SPECIAL TURNER FOR HOBBY ERR BUT SERRA AND WHO IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE AMELIA VERNIS THAT WHO IS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ANTI TRUST EXPERT BUT NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS PARAMOUNT TO STRENGTHEN ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE. AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE. TO PROTECT PATIENT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTH CARE SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN FOCUSES ON TO. ISSUES AND IT FIRST IT REQUIRES LARGE HELP THERE'S CARE SYSTEMS PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS AND HEDGE FUNDS TO OBTAIN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S APPROVAL BEFORE ACQUIRING OR AFFILIATING WITH PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS. TO BE APPROVED THESE TRANSACTIONS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT PATIENTS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER QUALITY LOWER COSTS OR INCREASE ACCESS AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THE SECOND PART OF THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS FROM ENGAGING IN BEHAVIOR THAT WOULD RAISE MARKET PRICES SINCE DIMINISH QUALITY REDUCE CHOICE INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF CARE OR DIMINISH ACCESS TO SERVICES. EVEN BEFORE THIS COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET WAS A GROWING CONCERN BECAUSE OF THESE LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A STUDY FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PHYSICIANS AND PRACTICES OWNED BY HOSPITALS INCREASED FROM ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IN TWENTY TEN TO MORE THAN 40% IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED 12% INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS EXPERIENCED AND TAKING ON THESE LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE MARKET. IN DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION AND EMPLACEMENT A TRUST ENTERED INTO A PRELIMINARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OVER LITIGATION OVER SUTTER HEALTH. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGED THAT SORT OF HEALTH IT OBTAINS SUBSTANTIAL MARKET POWER AND CERTAIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MARKETS TO ACQUISITIONS OF NOT ONLY HOSPITALS BUT ALSO PHYSICIAN GROUPS AND SURGICAL CENTERS. THE SETTLEMENT INCLUDED A GROUNDBREAKING FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN FEES AND BROAD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO RE BALANCE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET. SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN BUILT ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S EXPERIENCE AND SUTTER HEALTH IN THE SUTTER HEALTH CASE BY GRANTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THESE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS ON THE FRONT END THAT LEAD TO THE CREATION OF THESE LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS AND ALSO. PROHIBIT THESE PREDATORY MARKET PRACTICES BY LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND MY COLLEAGUE AND I ARE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

VERY GOOD NE MOMENT PLEASE THANK YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE THAT THEN IS YOUR- AT THIS TIME. WE WILL GO TO LINE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THAT'S ONE FOUR SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING DOCTOR PAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ALEX HAWTHORN AT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. LISTEN TO THIS BILL- I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PUBLIC NOW THAT THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND WE CHANGE WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES AHEAD. TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. WOULD NINETEEN HAS PUT TREMENDOUS STRAIN ON HOSPITAL FINANCES BUT WE STILL REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING ON. A EXISTING PIECES OF LEGISLATION WITH THE GOVERNOR ADMINISTRATION- THE LEGISLATURE TO FOCUS ON THAT HEALTHCARE SPENDING IN COSTS WITH THE GOAL. OF LOWERING GROWTH AND THE TOTAL COST OF CARE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE OPPOSITE HEALTHCARE PORTABILITY WAS MENTIONED. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THAT THAT BILL AND LEANING INTO THAT PROCESS- UNFORTUNATELY ESPYS NINE SEVEN SEVEN IS NOT THE CORRECT APPROACH. AND IS A DEEPLY FLAWED PROPOSAL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR SOME TIME HAS HAD QUITE BROAD AUTHORITY- OVER HOSPITAL PURCHASES THAT LARGE ASSET TRANSFERS- EXISTING PROCESS IS FLAWED. THE GOAL SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO PRESERVE ACCESS TO CARE- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROCESS IN PLACE CURRENTLY HAS RESULTED IN A HOSPITAL CLOSURES. MATTER SEVERAL SEVERAL RECENT EXAMPLES OF THAT. THE BILL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY- DOUBLES DOWN ON THAT PROCESS IT IS INCREDIBLY BROAD IT SWEEPS AND COUNTLESS ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE COMMON AMONGST A HOSPITALS PHYSICIANS. LABORATORIES AND OTHERS I'M WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LARGE SCALE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT VERY GRANULAR AND DAY TO DAY. A COMMON ARRANGEMENTS AMONGST PROVIDERS- PEACE ARRANGEMENTS EXIST FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY EXPAND ACCESS TO SERVICES CLINICAL IMMIGRATION. BUT ACCORDING TO PATIENT CARE- BOLSTERED SUPPORT FOR OUR WORKFORCE FOR NURSES AND PHYSICIANS. THE BILL PROVIDES VIRTUALLY NO APPEAL PROCESS FOR HOSPITALS OR OTHER PROVIDERS THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT THERE'S NO GUARD RAILS THERE'S NO CLEAR DEFINITIONS ARE PARAMETERS. IT IT BESTOWS ABSOLUTE AN ARBITRARY DISCRETION- ON THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND IT ALSO CREATES A GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT SYSTEM FOR MY MEMBERS. FINALLY FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IS CONSOLIDATES TREMENDOUS POWER- INTO ONE PLACE AND THIS IS A PLACE THAT WILL HAVE POWER OVER EACH OF YOUR COMMUNITIES FOR YOUR HOSPITALS FOR YOUR POSITIONS- FOR YOUR POSITION GROUPS IN LABORATORIES- IT'S A VERY POLITICAL PROCESS IN OUR EXPERIENCE. IN A MINUTE IT IS CERTAIN TO HALT THE WORK BEING DONE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND REDUCE CRITIC. TASK THAT. JUST FINAL NOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS WE DID RECEIVE THOSE LATE LAST NIGHT- OUR INITIAL READ OF THEM IS THE ONLY ADDRESS- A VERY SMALL PART OF THIS WHICH WAS SMALL PRACTICES- OTHER THAN THAT WE- WE DO THEM IS LARGELY TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S- OPENED THE- TELECONFERENCE LINE TO- PUBLIC COMMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE SEVEN SEVEN AND- ASKED THAT PEOPLE STATE THEIR NAME THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR POSITION WHICH I PRESUME SHOULD BE OPPOSED SUCH AS THE OPPOSITION TIME.

THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANY OTHER TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION SEEING NONE- MEMBERS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THE BILL OKAY THERE'S A MOTION FROM SIR LEYVA THAT'S A RUBIO. THANK YOU- WELL FIRST FOUR THANK MISTER MONEY BECAUSE I AND I DEFENDER STAND- AS I AM READING- THE AG'S LETTER IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL AS YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT- DURING THIS TIME WERE SMALL FACILITIES ARE VULNERABLE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE PREDATORY AT YOU KNOW HEDGE FUND DOOR EQUITY GROUPS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW SO I KNOW THAT TEMPORE INTO HAVE SOME SAFEGUARDS IN THAT REGARD- AND- I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS RATHER I MEAN ASK YOU ALL KNOW WE GOT. MONEY AMENDMENTS LAST NIGHT AFTER I WENT TO SEE WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ I'M UP DID NOT AND SO THERE'S A LITTLE- CONCERN OF NOT HAVING UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO- I HAVE OVER A DOZEN FACILITIES AND COMMUNITY. AND TOM AND TOM IT IN THAT ARM THAT THE BILL MAKES IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT- WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SMALLER FACILITIES THAT ALREADY STRUGGLING RGHT BUT I FEEL LIKE THE SAME ARGUMENT CAN BE DONE ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE MET WITH ALL MY MIGHT WRITERS AND MY- SECOND. ANY STRUGGLING THEY HAVE CONCERNS IN AND SO NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE ON IN IMPACT I TO THIS FOR THE SEMI AREA IN I AM ALWAYS CAN ABOUT JOB LOSS. ACCESS TO CALL CARE IS THE THAT REPRESENT. SOME OF THE MOST. BANISHED AND SO FOR ME IT'S A LITTLE THE END. QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE. AND I KNOW CLARA. SO I WILL. READ WITH RED. BECAUSE HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH ANYBODY TO DISCUSS THIS BILL. SO AGAIN I WILL- SUPPORTED BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- I YOU KNOW I ALSO HEARD THAT THIS IS BASED ON THE SUTTER SITUATION AND- SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT. SOME SITUATIONS BECAUSE OTHERS TO DEAL WITH THE BRUNT OF THE POLICY WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE INITIAL INTENT OF THE BILL. BUT AGAIN IT'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I NEED CLARIFICATION ON. I YOU DID STATE THAT THIRTEEN FACILITIES WILL FALL UNDER THIS REVIEW. BUT THAT MIGHT CHANGE SO YOU'RE NOT SURE AND SO AGAIN A LOT OF UNKNOWNS RIGHT NOW FOR ME SO I WILL SUPPORT WITH RESERVATIONS AND HOPEFULLY. WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. SEEING NONE I JUST CEREMONY I TO GET A WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND ALSO WANTING TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- IT I DO. WE WERE NEGOTIATING TOLL FAIRLY LATE SO HIGH MY APOLOGIES- FOR THE LATE MEN MEN SO THEY BASICALLY DO- TRY TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS EIGHT AND DIED NAY NOTE THAT THE OPPOSITION DID NOT FIND THEM SUFFICIENT FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT DESPITE ON THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND TERMS OF. FIGURING OUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD- JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE THINGS SO WE DID- ASKS FOR A TIGHTER DEFINITION OF FILIATION IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF WHAT TO RELATIONSHIPS WOULD GO BE UNDER TO ATTORNEY GENERAL SCRUTINY- WE'VE CREATED MORE SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE IN TERMS OF- BASICALLY SHOWING THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER CLINICAL INTEGRATION AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE SO THERE'S MORE CERTAINTY FOR STAYS FOR THE- PRESIDENT'S AS TO WHAT. WILL QUALIFY SO WE SPECIFIED SIMPLICITY- GUIDELINES FROM FROM WIDELY RECOGNIZED NATIONAL GROUPS- AND THEN ALSO- WE ACTUALLY SAID ANY TRANSACTION UNDER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR BELOW- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ASSEMBLY REVIEW FOR MARKET. FIRST SCREEN FOR ESSENTIALLY MARKET FOR THAT CONSOLIDATIONS ANOTHER TO WE'RE TRYING AND DON'T FORGET THAT ONE THE PARTIES INVOLVED IS GOING TO BE A LARGE HELPS PROTECT ONLY THIRTEEN FIVE AND TWENTIES CALIFORNIA THE ONE THREE A LARGE PARTY. THE OTHER ONE THAT TURN THE OTHER NIGHT THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THEM ARE FOR COULD BE FAIRLY SMALL BUT THERE ARE- IT TRANSACTION PLEASE ON FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. I WOULD TO MALL YEAH WE IS MORE THAN A STATE OF MISSION THIS DO YOU. OUR. JERRY JONES. QUICKLY LOOK AT IN STATE THAT CHANGE THE MARKET IS GOING TO LIKE THEY COME IN OP THE MARK BECAUSE THIS SERVICE. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF DOESN'T TRIGGER THE- THEN THEY WOULD NOT RE IT SO IT IT DOES THEN THEY CAN REVIEW BECAUSE AGAIN DON'T WANT THE OVER MARKETS. SO THAT'S A VERY QUICK SUMMARY OF THE MAIN AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IT'S ONE TO MENTION THOSE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE DID- I KNOW PEOPLE THAT LATE AT NIGHT- SO WITH THAT I THINK SEVEN CONSULTED YOU HAVE A QUESTION. OKAY ALL RIGHTS OPERATE- AND THEN PERHAPS AND IT'S CENTER MINING AT THAT SO- DID YOU WANT ANSWERS AND RUBIO IS. DO THAT IN THE COURSE MY THOSE OF THIS. OKAY TIME A MEDIUM ONE OTHER COMMENT. LIKE SO AGAIN I THINK THAT IS. A BILL TO CHALLENGE WITH VOICE WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH TERMS OF OUR HEALTH CARE CLASSES THE TENSION BETWEEN. WE WANT PEOPLE ORGANIZED TOGETHER TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE. RIGHT WE KNOW THAT- SOLO PRACTICES SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE TO CAPITAL AND SO FORTH. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WHEN PEOPLE ARE ONLY CONSOLIDATED. THEY ALSO IT'S ARE DEVELOPING AT TOO MUCH MARKET POWER WHICH TRIES OF COST WITHOUT GETTING INCREASING VALUE SO. THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS REALLY TO TRY TO- HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EVALUATE FOR LARGE SYSTEMS. BECAUSE ONLY PRICE WHEN THE PARTIES HAVE TO BE ALERT SYSTEM. THAT THEY ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF ACQUISITION OR A PHILLY LC KNITTING AFFILIATION. THAT DAY. THAT THERE IS SOME REVIEW TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST SIMPLY CONSOLIDATING THE MARKET EVEN MORE AND WE'RE NOT GETTING SOME BENEFIT OUT OF THAT. NOW WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHETHER THE AGES ARE RIGHT BY YOU DO THAT AND OTHER TYPES OF. THINGS THAT'S WHAT THE ROLE THE H. AS- BECAUSE DUE TO TAKE STE. AND SO. THAT IS. WHAT THAT SO BAD BECAUSE OF THAT. YEAH SUPPORT THE BILL. HAS I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO DIALOGUE AGAIN PRE. THE V. THE PIECE OF. BACK AND FORTH WITH WITH THE KEYS OFFICE IN REGARDS BILL SO WITH THAT. MONEY LIKE. YEAH AND AGAIN I THINK MR CHEERING. I DO NOT DRESS SENATOR RUBIO IT'S QUITE. IN IN THE OF MY CLOTHES. BUT I DO ALSO. I THANK YOU IN YOUR STATE. TWENTY AND I THINK WE'VE LANDED IN A GOOD SPOT IN ANY DO A FOR MY- COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING. TO WORK ON THIS SO A COUPLE OF PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND THOSE OF SOME OF THOSE THAT THAT WEIGHED IN. WITH CONCERNS ARE OPPOSITION AND I KNOW A SENATOR RUBIO YOU WERE JUST. RAISING QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DISTRICT IN THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT. FIRST AND FOREMOST. THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO EMPOWER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PROHIBIT BLOCK- OR GET IN THE WAY OF. AFFILIATIONS ACQUISITIONS MERGERS THAT WILL BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITIES. THE LENS IS HOW OUR PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS GOING TO BE. IMPACTED SO FOR ME I REPRESENT A NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I GAVE THE EXAMPLE. OF ONE IT WAS IN THE WATSONVILLE AREA PURCHASE BY HEDGE FUND PRIVATE TO PRIVATE. THE AG HAD NO JURISDICTION NOBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT A COMMUNITY HEALTH TRUSTS SOUGHT TO ENGAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO HAD TO RESPOND I'M SORRY. THIS IS PRIVATE TO PRIVATE I DO NOT HAVE JURISDICTION. THE CONCERN THE ONLY EMERGENCY ROOM IN THAT COMMUNITY THE NEXT CLOSEST AN HOUR AWAY. THE FEAR OF IF THEY CLOSE THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHAT HAPPENS SO. WELL WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY THE AG DOES OVER NONPROFIT. AND TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT HOSPITAL IN A PRIVATE OR NON-PROFIT BUYER. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT A CONTINUATION OF SERVICES. THE BACKDROP OF THIS. THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS THAT WE'VE GONE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HOSPITAL BEDS. TO UNDER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IT'S ALMOST HAVE THE NUMBER OF HOSPITAL BEDS DURING CORONAVIRUS WE SEE THIS NEED TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY THAT'S ONE OF THE- EMERGING THE RESPONSES GOVERNOR TO SOME PRIORITIZE. BUILDING ARKHAM. BUT ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS IT SHRUNK AND IT SHRUNK BECAUSE- SOME OF THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR CORPORATE EFFICIENCY SHAREHOLDER PROFIT BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO THE GOOD OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE GOOD OF PUBLIC HEALTH REMAINS AT THE FOREFRONT OF SOME OF THESE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS AGAIN IF IT PASSES THAT LITMUS TEST. THERE'S NO CATCH THIS BILL ALSO EMPOWERS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO WAIVE. CHECK EARLY IN RURAL AREAS BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HE AND HIS STAFF IN REVIEWING A PROPOSED ACQUISITION MERGER WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE THEY CAN DO A QUICK LITMUS TEST AND IF IT MEETS THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY THEY CAN WAVE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT IS AVAILABLE UNDER THIS BILL BUT NOT MANDATORY THERE IS A WAIVER AUTHORITY TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC INTEREST THE PUBLIC HEALTH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH. FROM I DID WANT TO MENTION- NOT IN TESTIMONY TODAY BUT HE A LATE LETTER FROM THE PACIFIC BUSINESS GROUP OF HEALTH IN SUPPORT. THEY REPRESENT EMPLOYERS WHO BY AND LARGE HEALTH PLANS TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES OF BUSINESSES OF BUSINESS ENTITIES SO THIS BILL INTERESTING THAT BRINGS TOGETHER. BUSINESS OWNERS. AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES THEIR COMMONALITY IS THAT THEY BOTH ARE BUYING PRODUCT FOR THEIR MEMBERS BE THE UNION MEMBERS OR BUSINESS EMPLOYEES OF THE BUSINESS SECTOR. SO YOU WILL THOSE LETTERS WERE SENT TO YOUR OFFICES THROUGH THE CHAIR IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT IT'S ONE THAT ON THE RECORD TO SUPPORT PACIFIC BUSINESS. OF ULTIMATELY WHAT WE SEEK IS TO EXPAND QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES ONE OF THE I THINK STRONG AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE CHAIR IS LOOKING NOT JUST AT. MARKET DOMINATION FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW. LOOKING AT ONE OF THE TESTS BEING NOT JUST ACCESS AT THE FRONT END. BUT OUTCOMES ARE THE DESIGNS OF HEALTH CONSOLIDATION GOING ONLY NEED TO BETTER OUTCOMES AND PART OF THAT WOULD BE SUPPORT MAINTENANCE A PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH TO DRUG TREATMENT ALCOHOL TREATMENT THINGS. LAN TO BETTER LONG TERM OUTCOMES FOR THAT COMMUNITY SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE I THINK STRONG PUBLIC HEALTH DEFINITIONS THAT WAS SUGGESTED. THROUGH THE CHAIR IN HIS STEP SO AGAIN- I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN PARTICULARLY EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN SOME OF ARGUED WILL BECAUSE OF IT NINETEEN IN THE SECOND EMIC PRESSURES. WE REALLY DIDN'T BE PUTTING IN MORE OVERSIGHT MORE REGULATION BECAUSE THESE ENTITIES ARE STRUGGLING. THIS IS EXACTLY NGUYEN LARGE HEAD COACH FUNDS WILL THAT DEEP POCKETS WILL COME IN A TAKE IT OF A LOCAL RURAL CLINICS STRUCK AS THE ROAD. THIS BILL DOESN'T PROHIBIT IT IT JUST SAYS IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT ARE WE GONNA REDUCE SERVICE THAT UNDERSERVED. WHERE WE GONNA MEAN SIR THIS CREW TO ASSIST SO THAT'S THE CHECK TO I HAVE EVERY. IN THE CHAIR IN IN- FOREVER. GENERAL IT WILL MISSION THE BILL BUT IS NOT OVER SOME IN AND FOR EMPOWER SEAT THE GENERAL TO THE SAME JURIST HE HAS IS OVER NON MERGERS TO EXTEND TO FOR MERGE IN FACT IT'S IN THE FOR A RE. THAT I FEAR THERE ARE GREATER ABUSES TAKING PLACE SO WITH THAT- I WOULD ASK RESPECTFULLY FREE YEAR HI VOTE IN AGAIN THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS SUPPORT OF BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR I KNEW THAT IT WAS CLOTHES SO WE HAVE OR BILLS WE HAVE BEEN IN HOUR BUT I WILL. CENTER GROVE ONE EIGHT. FOR MORE FOR QUESTION YOU ANSWER CHARITY APOLOGIZE I A JUST LIKE TO US ALL A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE BILL ALLOW FOR RULES TO APPLY FOR IF IT WOULD IMPROVING IS THERE A CRIED I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT LOOKING AT YOU IS THERE A CRITERIA THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS GOING TO USE- ON DETERMINE ACTS IS ANY IT AG AND NUYS THE REQUEST THEIR APPEAL PROCESS FOR LOCAL SPITTLE FOR ONE IN TWO. OR THREE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES THAT SHOULD THE CURRENT REVIEW A PROCESSING CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE HOSPITAL AND DOES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE HOSPITAL HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED AND IT WILL LET ME TAKE THE FIRST AND THEN AGAIN IN THE PHONE LADY'S OFFICE IF THEY WANNA ADD ON TO THE CHAIR BUT FIRST OF ALL THE ON THE ON. THE H. AT. OF THE- ACT. MERGER IT IS IN IF A QUICK REVIEW SHOWS THAT OING TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY. HE HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO APPROVE AND WAIVE ANY. NO LONGER TERM PROCESS OF EVALUATION ETCETERA. THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION I THINK WENT TO REMIND ME- ON THE CONDITIONS PLACED ON THE HOSPITAL IS THERE A CURRENT OR THE GUIDELINES IN STATUTE SO THAT WE CAN SEE THE CONDITIONS ARE REPLACED ON THE HOSPITAL. WHEN YOU SEE CONDITIONS PLACED ON A HOSPITAL SO A HOSPITAL THAT SEEKING TO EXPAND ITS OPERATION THROUGH ACQUISITION- OF OTHER HOSPITALS OR CLINICS. THE TWO CRITERIA THEIR EXPLICIT IN THE BILL LOOK TO. MAINTENANCE ARE IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. AND IN ORDINANCE MARKET CONTROL LEADING TO ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICE THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE THE TWO EXPLICIT CRITERIA THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BE HELD TO TERMS OF APPEAL RIGHTS. THE BILL IS EXPLICIT IN SAYING IF AN APPLICANT IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE DECISION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THEY CAN FILE FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE THEY HAVE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT KEPT WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVING THAT INVOICE. THEY CAN SEEK REVIEW IN A COURT OF LAW THROUGH A WRIT OF MANDATE RATES ARE THE FASTEST PROCESS TO DO PROCESS IN PORT SOME SO WE BASICALLY IN. GRIEVED APPLICANT TAX TO THE COURT TO IT OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE THEATER GENERAL CAN BE. IN THAT. HE IS NO LONGER THE MAKER THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE OKAY THANK YOU YEAH. BUT THERE A MOTION ON THIS BILL.

VIDEO THROUGH ZOOM AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE CENTER JACKSON- KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WAITING AWHILE. THANK YOU I ALMOST FEEL LIKE A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE HAVING. HEARD ALL THE BILLS AND SO FORTH SO I AM DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO SB TWELVE AU SEVEN TO YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AT THE TOP OF PAGE SEVEN I IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. SO SB TWELVE AU SEVEN ENSURES THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HIGHLY VULNERABLE PERSONS RESIDING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DURING POWER OUTAGES FIRST FROM VIRGIN. A NAP DISASTER OR A SAFE POWER SHOT TWICE KNOWN AS PS PS IS. ON ANY OF THOSE ADVANCE. BY REQUIRING A MINIMUM OF NINETY SIX HOURS WORTH OF BACKUP POWER TO THE CRITICAL SYSTEMS UPON WHICH THESE. FACILITIES AND THESE RESIDENTS FOR. RELY THIS. REQUIREMENT ARE CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME RESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS FACED SERIOUS RISKS FROM DISASTER RELATED EMERGENCIES SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES FLOODS MUD SLIDES AND WILDFIRES IN ADDITION TO THE MOST CURRENT ARE CRISIS RELATED THIS COVERT NINETEEN. HOWEVER TODAY THE DANGERS THEY FACE ARE MAGNIFIED EXPONENTIALLY DUE TO MASSIVE BLACKOUTS TRIGGERED BY P. JEANNIE AND OTHER UTILITY COMPANIES. THAT ARE DOING WORK ON THEIR VERY IS TO QUIT. OSTENSIBLY TO PREVENT WILDFIRES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. DOZENS OF CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES LOST POWER DURING THOSE P. S. P. S. PERIODS AND SOMETIMES FOR DAYS AS OF THESE COMPANIES THE UTILITIES- WENT THROUGH THIS P. S. P. S. PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS- ENERGY. URGENT PATIENT- AND A WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THIS DISTRICTS TO. SENIORS ARE INCREASE IN REAL THREATS TO THE HEALTH WELL BE. TO THE- AT THE FACILITIES TO THEIR OWN OXYGEN TANKS FOR EXAMPLE TO THE MEDICINES THAT THEY RELY UPON TO SURVIVE AS WELL AS PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH HEAT TEMPERATURES BEING EXTREME AND WHICH HAVE SUCH ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. NOW THIS RISK OF COURSE HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO EVEN SHARPER RELIEF AS A RESULT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN VIRUS THAT IS SWEEPING OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD- EARLY OF COURSE WE KNOW ARE AMONG THE MOST AT RISK OF INFECTION AND DEATH AND THAT MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND NURSING HOME. IN CAL WE HAVE ALREADY THEIR LIVES THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST OF IF NOT MORE DANCE CHAMPION AND THESE THE NORTH NURSING FACILITIES. WELL THE FOCUS HERE IS THE USUAL POWER AT THOSE FACILITIES AND WITHOUT POWER THE RESIDENTS ARE A GREAT RISK MOST RESIDENTS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY VULNERABLE MANY ARE COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR CARE GIVERS TO THEIR POOR HEALTH AND SOME RELY AS TO MENTION ON ELECTRICAL POWER DUE TO. JUST JUST SAY A. BASED FREE TRADE BETTER AND MEDICAL THIS IS WITHOUT CAN HAVE DEADLY CALM FOR THESE REST AND- THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS A WAS A GREAT CAN TO ME AND I KNOW TOO MANY THAT FEW OF OUR STATES NURSING HOMES ARE PREPARED TO KEEP THEIR RESIDENT SHAPE DURING EMERGENCIES AND EXTENDED POWER OUTAGES ACCORDING TO FEDERAL REPORTS AND ANECDOTALLY I THINK ALL WITHIN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN. OUR AS A RESULT THE VARIOUS FIRES AS THE PSP A SHOT OFF- BECAME A MORE AND MORE IN THE FOR AND OF COURSE NOW WITH OUR COLD WITH NINETEEN PRICES. CORD NUMBER OF. NINETEEN FROM THE HEALTH HUMAN. OFFICE ARE ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND THAT ARE CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH DURING EMERGENCIES. ALL OF THE NURSING HOMES THAT IT EXAMINED IN HIGH RISK AREAS OF THE STATE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED CRITICAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS STANDARDS. RATHER GO INTO GREAT DETAIL. ON THAT I JUST WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT OUR CURRENT STATE REGULATIONS. ONLY REQUIRE NURSING FACILITIES TO PROVIDE VERY LIMITED BACKUP POWER FOR APPROXIMATELY SO UP TO SIX. HOURS AND THIS IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT SO THIS WEEK'S. IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER IN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT CLIMATE OF EXTREME WEATHER WILD FIRES AND POWER OUTAGES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CURRENT PANDEMIC. SO SB TWELVE AU SEVEN. INSTEAD REQUIRES CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO HAVE BACKUP POWER SYSTEMS THAT MAINTAIN SAFE TEMPERATURES AND POWER TO CRITICAL SYSTEMS FOR RESIDENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR AT LEAST NINETY SIX HOURS DURING ANY TYPE OF POWER OUTAGE. THIS BILL WHY NINETY SIX HOURS IT CONFORMS STATE PRACTICES THE CURRENT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE EVENT THAT MORE PROTECTIVE REGULATIONS OR RULES ARE ADOPTED LATER BY EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NOW WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN REDUCING A LOT OF. ITS REGULATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE AND SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN FACT TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH WE BELIEVE THEY ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE TO CONFORM TO THOSE REGULATIONS. AND KNOW THAT IT IS BEST FOR NURSING HOME A NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS TO SHELTER IN PLACE IMPOSSIBLE DURING ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS. SO IF THAT IS THE REASON WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROTECT THESE PATIENTS. HAVE TO THE SAFE AND. FOR GEN STAYS AND OTHER SURE EXCUSE ME PROVIDE THOSE ASSIGNED PART. SO I THINK WITH ME TO ON THE LINE AT LEAST ARE THE BILL'S CO SPONSORS KAREN JONES DIRECTOR AND PROGRAM MANAGER UP FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND MICHAEL CONNORS ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES. FOR NURSING HOME REFORM OKAY THANKS SO MUCH SENATOR JACKSON'S SO- MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE BRING- KAREN JONES ON THE LINE. DO YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU IF YOU DO A SHORTER OF BE APPRECIATED WE'RE UP AGAINST TIME CAP. SO TURN JONES. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MY NAME IS KAREN JONES AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR  PROGRAM MANAGER FOR LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF SALAS DISPOSE COUNTY. I'VE BEEN AN OMBUDSMAN FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS AND FOR THE PAST THIRTEEN YEARS I PARTNERED WITH STAINLESS BUT PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;OUNTY HEALTH AGENCY. THE&lt;/c&gt;</u> PLAN FOR EMERGENCIES THAT AFFECT LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES POWER OUTAGES FIRES NUCLEAR EVENT AND PANDEMICS I AM AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF OUR COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER FOR KEVIN NINETEEN. BUT WE'VE LEARNED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN HURRICANE KATRINA CHANGED EVERYTHING FIRMER TO KEEP ENDING CARE FACILITIES. A PERFECT TO HAVE ATTY. TO ALTERNATE POWER DURING OUTAGES AND A SHELTER IN PLACE WHENEVER POSSIBLE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWELVE ELDERLY RESIDENTS DIE. DID HE STARTED NURSING HOW MANY ARE THERE. THIS WAS IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE IRMA WHERE THE FACILITY HAD LOST POWER IN THE IN ATTEMPT NEAR ONE HUNDRED EAST. SO THAT LAW POWER NO CONTROL THE HEAT. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA HAS WE ON NUMBER PROVIDER START GETTING PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOW OFF THE TERM OFF POWER IN LARGE PORTIONS THE STATE. LEAVING CARE FACILITIES AND THE MANY WHO ARE IN THE DARK. THE CIVILITY IS A DID NOT HAVE NINETY SIX HOURS OF GENERATOR FUEL DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS TO PROVIDE SAFE MEDICINE FOR TEMPERATURES FOR THE RESIDENTS. PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE REQUIRED OXYGEN DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO ACCESS TO THE POWER THAT THEIR CONCENTRATORS NEEDED. AND THANKS FOR NOT. ADEQUATE SUPPLY. ACT POWERS THAT SET OFF TO CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS. SB TWELVE AU SEVEN WELL I'M SURE THAT NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THE MOST BASIC OF RESIDENT NEEDS DURING AN OUTAGE. AND SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT CONSIDERED WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST PROPOSED IS IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT- EVEN DURING A POWER OUTAGE CARE FACILITY RESIDENTS DO NOT GO TO A COMMUNITY SHELTER. WHERE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE SIX OF IT NINETEEN WILL BE MUCH GREATER. THE FACILITIES NEED TO SHELTER IN PLACE AND WE NEED THEM TO DO THAT WITH. THE THAT THE RESIDENTS NEED. BILL WILL PROVIDE FOR THAT THAT MINITOWER AND IT WILL TAKE CARE OF WHAT THOSE RESIDENTS NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S BRING ON- MICHAEL CONNORS SO YOU HAVE FIFTY SIX SEONDS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'D LIKE HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA OUT TO GET SOME PERSONAL FOR. THANK YOU FOR SENATOR JACKSON'S GREAT LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE.

ALLOWING THAT MANUFACTURE TO TAKE PRICES WITHOUT COMPETITION THIS CONSOLIDATION ULTIMATELY BE IN THE CONSUMER PAY MORE FOR GENERIC MEDICATION BUT THEY SHUT IN SOME CASES A SINGLE MANY FACTOR HAS GONE UP THE PRICE OF LONG DEAD YOU GENERIC. DRUG BY ASTONISHING ABOUT. INSULIN AND ANOTHER OF PRICE HIKES BUT LIMIT CONSUMER ACCESS TO THE- DRUGS. BY CREATING THIS OFFICE THE STATE COULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH THE HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

BUT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN GENERICS THE PRICE OF GENERIC SKYROCKET OR THEIR UNAVAILABLE ACCORDING TO SB SEVENTEEN DATA GENERIC DRUGS HAVE THE LARGEST THREE YEAR MEDIAN INCREASE OF ANY OTHER TYPE OF DRUGS OVER THE RECENT TIME PERIOD AND THAT WAS THIRTY SEVEN POINT 6% WE KNOW THAT PARTLY DUE TO A LACK OF COMPETITION THAT LET COMPANY.

SINCE YOU LIKE TO VOICE OPPOSITION PRESS PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE ONE WILL GO TO THE LINE OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO THAT'S TWO EIGHT TWO. PLEASE PROCEED NOT SURE IT MIGHT COMING THROUGH ON THAT SIR YES YES. OKAY SORRY SIR- MY NAME IS BRETT MICHELIN WITH THE ASSOCIATION FOR EXCEPTIONAL MEDICINES AND WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN OPPOSITION AT ALL OF THIS BILL IN FACT WE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO OTHERS SENATOR PAN- VOICING JUST SIMPLY SOME QUESTIONS. DOES SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF SAID THAT GENERICS. MEDICATIONS ARE WHAT. REALLY REDUCE THE COST OF MEDICATIONS FOR THE STATE AND FOR PATIENTS HOWEVER SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS. PRESENTED I DO WANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD A LITTLE BIT. SB SEVENTEEN REPORTS SHOW THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED GENERIC DRUGS I CALVET 39% ARE NEARLY 40% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS BUT YET ARE ONLY FOUR POINT 8% OF TOTAL ACTUAL SPENDING. AND ONLY 3% OF TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS. THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY GENERIC DRUGS ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 25% OF ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND LESS THAN 80% OF TOTAL PLANNED OUR TOLL SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THIS IS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF ALL HEALTH PREMIUMS. IT'S TRUE OR THE AND FOR THE HIGH CALL OF PRE DRUG AND- THE CONCERN WITH THE BILL IN THE QUESTIONS WE WANTED TO POST TO SENATOR PAN AS SHE MOVES FORWARD THIS TO DON'T DISRUPT THE COMPETITION. THE STATE IS GOING TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE MANUFACTURER THAT'S GREAT MORE OPEN TO THAT. IF IT'S A DEFEAT- YOU KNOW- EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO- YOU SEE STROKES FOR THE STATE OR IF THE STATE WANTS TO GET INTO MANUFACTURING IT ON ITS OWN DOWN THE LINE USER PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE INVALID DEVELOP WAYS. BUT WHEN YOU DO GET INVOLVED THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED- AND I THINK OUR LETTER- REALLY RACES SOME OF THOSE WHAT WAS SENATOR PAN AND CERTAINLY HOPE HE CONSIDERS THOSE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THAT EXHAUST THE- ONLINE TESTIMONY MODERATOR THAT IS AFFIRMATIVE SIR ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO. CLOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AS VICE CHAIR- AGAIN APPRECIATE- THE COMMENTS- LET ME KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS- PRIMARILY FOR AT THIS STAGE TO ACTUALLY EXAMINE ALL THE VARIOUS ISSUES SO I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. THAT TO OFFICE TO- TO TAKING CONSIDERATION WOULD I DON'T IMAGINE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING TO THE CONTRACTOR MANUFACTURE ALL GENERICS- I THINK THE IDEA IS TO FOCUS ON THE ONES SO WHERE WE MIGHT. CHALLENGES ¢H RELIABLE SUPPLY BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE MAKE SURE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN PERHAPS THE GENERIC DRUG MADE. PRICE SOME THAT WE- STILL STRONG SUPPORT I AND ADEQUATE TO. AT THE SAME TIME WE- DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT- COMPETITION IN PLACE OF FORD- PARTICULAR GENERIC DRUGS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE. SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WITH THAT ASPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO. DO YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SO I ACTUALLY JUST TO CLARIFY TO THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU SORRY I HAVE. PAN I AM HI NIELSEN. NO NO WELCOME NIELSEN NO GONZALEZ HI.
