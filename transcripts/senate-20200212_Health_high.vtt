TWENTY SIXTEEN CELEBRATE

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.173
DRAMATIC RISE. WE ALSO KNOW

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.341
THAT THE MARKETING OF FLAVOR

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.009
TOBACCO PRODUCTS PLAYED A MAJOR

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:24.310
ROLE IN ATTRACTING USE TO

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.512
VAPING AND THOSE NUMBERS

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.779
CONCERTS FIRM THAT WE SHOULD

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.548
ALL BE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.616
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOW

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.850
CALIFORNIA'S LEAD IN RAISING

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.185

TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO TWENTY ONE

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.522
AND THE FDA ALSO ISSUED A

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.524
TEMPORARY BAN ON MOST FLEETING.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.025
FLAVORED BAKING PRODUCTS UNTIL

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:39.893
MANUFACTURES CAN SHOW THE

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.661
PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. AND

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.263
CERTAINLY THE RISING YOU TO USE

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.731
AN ACCESS OF ANY CONCERN FOR

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.599
MANY YEARS. AND THE NUMBERS

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:49.068
THAT I. QUOTED PROVIDE PROOF

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.203
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.504
TAKE BOLD STEPS BEYOND JUST

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.438
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.207
DONE. I THINK WE NEED TO

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.975
RECOGNIZE THAT WAS CERTAINLY-

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:57.143
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.679
HAVE ARGUED THAT VAPING AS X.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.681
GOKUL SAFER ALTERNATIVES THEN.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.316
PERHAPS COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:06.152
THAT WE DO SEE THIS RISE IN USE

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.554
WHO MANY WAYS IS THE FIRST

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.656
INTRODUCTION TO NICOTINE. AND

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.391
NICOTINE WHETHER IT'S AN OF A

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.927
PRODUCT OR IN A COMBUSTIBLE

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.028
CIGARETTE IS AN ADDICTIVE

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.629
SUBSTANCE ONE THAT WE SHOULD

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.531
NOT BE INTRODUCING ARE USED TO

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:19.966
WE KNOW THAT STUDIES HAVE ALSO

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:22.335
SHOWN THAT- IF YOU GET.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.504
DISPOSED TO NICOTINE- THROUGH

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.072
VAPING YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.840
THEN MOVE ON TO COMBUSTIBLE

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.577
CIGARETTES- I WOULD ALSO MAKE

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.447
NOTE THAT- UNFORTUNATELY- WELL.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:35.982
THE AP HAS BEEN TOUTED AS AN

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.251
ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES AND

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.687
MAYBE- BUT NOT AS FAR AS I

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.690
KNOW. NO VAPING PRODUCTS HAS

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.426
BEEN. FORMALLY SUBMITTED TO THE

FDA FOR USE AS A SMOKING

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:52.432
CESSATION- DEVICE SO- I THINK

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.033
THAT'S IT THE FACT THAT THAT

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.135
HASN'T HAPPENED YET- I THINK

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.705
THOSE RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.973
ANY SORT OF CLAIMS THAT THIS IS

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.608

MISTER CHAIR OF A GLITCH IN THE-

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.964
DO IS IT. OR ARE THE FLAVORS

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.566
WHAT IS THE ATTRACTIVE NATURE

00:10:33.632 --> 00:10:35.401
OF THE E. CIGARETTE TO THEM OR

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.970
IS IT THE- THIS SECTION IS OF

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.505
SOME OF THOSE PRODUCTS THE

00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.640
DISPENSING DEVICES. I THINK

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:42.875
THAT IT IS A COMBINATION OF

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:43.976
BOTH AND I THINK THAT THAT IS

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:45.344
WHAT FUELED THE RISE OF

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.079
PRODUCTS LIKE JEWEL WHICH WERE-

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:49.515
LOOKS JUST LIKE A STANDARD USB

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:52.752
DEVICE THAT- MOST A SCHOOL-

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.687
TEACHERS- AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.322
IN SCHOOLS. HAD NO IDEA WHAT

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.990
THESE WERE A SEVERAL YEARS AGO

00:10:58.057 --> 00:10:59.392
SO I DO THINK THAT- THE KINDS

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.293
OF DEVICES ARE ONE THING BUT IT

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.795
IT'S THE FLAVORS AT ALSO REALLY

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:03.796
ATTRACT INDIVIDUALS TO IT

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:04.897
BECAUSE IF IT REALLY TASTED

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.465
LIKE TOBACCO I DON'T THINK THAT

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.266
PEOPLE WOULD REALLY BE USING

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.501
THOSE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S I

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.702
THINK THE MAIN REASON WHY YOU

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.270
SEE. MOST YOUTH USING FLAVORED

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.438
ALEX RATHER THAN SOMETHING

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.306
THAT- DISPLAY FOR LIKE TOBACCO.

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.008
IN IF I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.610
ANOTHER QUESTION FUTURE THE-

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:22.081
THE- HE WOULD TALK ABOUT WE

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.015
ASSUME THAT NICOTINE IS. A

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.250
PROBLEM IN THE ADDICTION IS A

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.351
PROBLEM WE KNOW WHAT THE

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:26.552
EFFECTS KßT LONG TERM CAN BE

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:28.487
WITH TOBACCO SMOKING BUT- WHAT

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:30.322
ARE THE EFFECTS OF. NICOTINE

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.058
ADDICTION TO A YOUNG PERSON

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.125
WHEN THEY'RE NOT SMOKING A

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.193
CIGARETTE AND ADDICTED TO THE

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.728
NICOTINE COMING FROM OF A PIN

00:11:35.795 --> 00:11:38.864
DEVICE. SO ARMY WE OF OFTEN-

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:40.633
HAD A LOT OF DEBATES- YOU

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.701
SINCE- THE- RISE OF ELECTRONIC

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.303
CIGARETTES AS TO THE RELATIVE

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.271
SAFETY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.139
SO- FOR EXAMPLE MANY PEOPLE

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.607

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.677
AWHILE AGO THAT SAID THAT-

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:52.244
THESE PRODUCTS ARE 95% SAFER

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.513
THAN. TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES. I

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.314
THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.349
DIFFICULT TO REALLY SAY THAT

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:58.117
WAS BASED ON A LOT OF

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.485
CONJECTURE ON DEVICES THAT WERE

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.586
PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.455

LIKE NICOTINE SALTS- ONE OF

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.366
THE- COUPONS IS EQUAL TO. THE

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.836
SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE THAT

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:31.917
CONSIDERED HEAVY SMOKING AND SO

00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:33.285
THE AMOUNT OF NICOTINE THAT

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.286
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.888
NOW IS TREMENDOUS- NICOTINE

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.424
ITSELF- HAS AN LD FIFTY NUMBER

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.558
WHICH MEANS THAT IT. IS A

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:42.161
LEGAL- KIND OF COMPOUND WHEN

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.963
GIVEN AT HIGH LEVELS AND SO. ON

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:45.164
PARTICULARLY WHEN THESE TYPE OF

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.799
PRODUCTS WERE FIRST MADE

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.134
AVAILABLE WHEN THE FOR FREE

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.235
FORM- WITH LITTLE REGULATION BE

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.136
WE WOULD HEAR ABOUT POISON

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.570
CONTROL CENTER CALLS GOING UP

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:53.172
WITH THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS SO.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:53.973
I THINK THAT WITH NICOTINE

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.509
ITSELF COME WHEN IT'S INHALED.

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:57.543
IN A WHILE EVEN WHILE THESE

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.944
PRODUCTS MAY NOT NECESSARILY.

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.412
BE BURNING MATERIALS THAT WOULD

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.847
HAVE CARCINOGENIC COMPOUNDS AS

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.282
MUCH AS WE WOULD SEE FROM OTHER

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:04.917
TYPE OF PRODUCTS. NICOTINE

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:06.652
AFFECTS MANY DIFFERENT. ORGANS

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.287
IN THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT IT

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:10.890
HAS A LOT OF CARDIO VASCULAR

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.825
EX. IT'S ALSO GOING TO THE

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.060
FACTS ARE THE DEVELOPING BRAIN

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.629
AS WELL SO THINK THAT. THEY'RE

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:17.596
NOT. GOING TO CONSIDER IT

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.298
WOULD. THAT BE THREE USE THIS

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:28.507
FOR. SENATE THINK STRUCTURE. DR

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:29.141
ON THANK YOU FOR BE HERE WITH.

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:29.942
TODAY SO WE HEAR FOR. JEWEL AND

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:30.876
THESE OTHER. THAT THIS IS A SUS.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.511
TO THE SOMEONE STOPS. AND GO TO

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:34.180
VAPE. IN ORDER TO HELP THEM

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.315
STOP SMOKING. I PERSONALLY I'M

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:38.317
NOT A DOCTOR- BUT I DON'T THINK

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:40.486
THAT RINGS TRUE WITH ME WHAT

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:42.221
RINGS TRUE WITH ME IS THAT

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.557
TOBACCO. USAGE WAS GOING DOWN

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.392
SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THE TOBACCO

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:48.294
INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR. A NEW

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.828
WAY TO MAKE MONEY. AND THE

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.597
FLAVORS ARE MARKETING DEVICE TO

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.732
GET MORE CHILDREN HOPPED. SO

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.201
THAT'S MY COMMENTARY MY

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.969
QUESTION IS. DO YOU THINK

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:59.605
THERE'S ANY VALUE IN VAPING. TO

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:03.142
BE USED AS A CESSATION DEVICE.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.677
I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.512
THAT VAPING DEVICES COULD BE

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.414
USED FOR CESSATION COMEDY HIT

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.249
AT- IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:12.251
KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE-

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:13.385
THAT OUR FOOD AND DRUG

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.820
ADMINISTRATION APPROVED FOR A

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.056
TOBACCO CESSATION. WE DO USE

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.424
NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.326
AND THERE IS A PRODUCT- HAT IS

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.294
A NICOTINE INHALER THAT- AS

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.163
DEVELOPED MANY YEARS AGO ON

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.898
THAT IT'S NOT THAT DISSIMILAR

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:28.033
TO A BEEPING DEVICE- THAT BEING

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.336
SAID- IN TERMS OF ITS USE FOR

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.738
CESSATION. HOW IT'S USED- IS

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.340
GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL IN

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.742
TERMS OF- HOW SOMEBODY'S GOING

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:37.576
TO BE ABLE TO SET SUCCESSFULLY

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.712
QUIT- AS SOMEBODY WHO DID SOME

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:41.013
OF THE EARLY RESEARCH IN TERMS

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.847
OF MAKING THESE TYPE OF

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.415
PRODUCTS OVER THE COUNTER WE

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:44.416
ALL THOUGHT AT THAT POINT IN

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:45.684
TIME THAT. MAKING NICOTINE

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:46.652
REPLACEMENT THERAPY OVER THE

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.120
COUNTER WOULD LEAD TO A LOT OF

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.088
CESSATION AND THAT DIDN'T

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.923
HAPPEN- EVEN THOUGH WE MAY LOTS

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.391
OF PRODUCTIONS THAT THAT WOULD

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:53.459
BE THE CASE. AND SO I THINK

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:54.793
THAT IN TERMS OF TO HAVING TRUE

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.328
CESSATON HAPPEN FOR

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:56.829
INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED A

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.464
COORDINATED EFFORT IT CAN'T

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.132
JUST BE FROM SOMEBODY BUYING IT

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.600
FROM A BAIT SHOP- IMMEDIATE WE

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.302
DO HERE MANY STORIES- FROM

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:04.803
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE. SAY THAT

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.638
THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ABLE

00:15:05.704 --> 00:15:07.473
TO TRANSITION OFFICE CIGARETTES

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.441
AND JUST BEEPING ONLY- YOU

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.043
OFTEN DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.610
PEOPLE THAT RELAPSE BECAUSE

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:12.244
THEY'RE NOT THE ONES ARE GOING

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.179
TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT- AND

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.614
SO I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.849
USING THESE TYPE OF PRODUCTS.

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:18.250
WELL THERE ARE RANDOMIZED

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:20.452
CONTROL TRIALS ON THAT ARE NOT

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.621
THE UNITED. THAT SHE NOT

00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.189
DEMONSTRATE INDIVIDUAL FOR A TO

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.391
STOP USING TRADITIONAL

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:26.292
CIGARETTE. ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.393
STUDY THAT WAS RECENTLY

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:28.394
PUBLISHED IN NEW ENGLAND

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.628
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE MOST PEOPLE

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.330
CONTINUE TO STAY ON USING

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.198
NICOTINE ITSELF SO THERE I'M

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.601
NOT TRULY QUITTING ALL NICOTINE

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:36.468
PRODUCTS. BUT THEY'RE

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:38.604
CONTINUING TO USE THESE TYPE OF

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:39.571
PRODUCTS WHICH IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:45.110
DEEM AS TOBACCO PRODUCTS. THE

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.545
TREATING WANTED. FOR A IT'S THE

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:47.746
ADDICTION IT IS THE NEW. IN

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:48.981
OKAY SO THEY'RE JUST YOU KNOW

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.382
CHANGING. PRODUCT FOR ANOTHER.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.983
I'M IN THAT THINGS WE DO A LOT

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.251
OF. DO WILL. AS WELL- IN THE

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.585
ADULT COMMUNITY AND I THINK

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:54.753
THAT THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WE

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.288
DO HAVE IS FOR YOU TO ARE

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:57.256
STARTING OFF USING NICOTINE

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.191
PRODUCTS. LIKE VAPING PRODUCTS

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.225
THAT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.393
TRANSITION TO OTHER TYPES OF

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.695
PRODUCTS THAT WILL HAVE MORE

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.862
HARM SUCH AS TRADITIONAL

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:04.763
CIGARETTES IN THE RIBBON.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.565
SEVERAL STUDIES. ON THAT BEEN

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:07.800
DONE HERE IN THE US THAT HAVE

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:08.967
LOOKED AT INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:09.968
OF THEIR TRANSITION FOLLOWING

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.537
THEM OVER TIME AND SEEN THAT.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:12.838
THERE TRANSITION RATES ARE

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:13.572
THREE TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER IN

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.740
TERMS OF STARTING A TRADITIONAL

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.542
CIGARETTE INITIATION AS OPPOSED

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.944
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TAPING.

00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:24.116
THANK YOU. QUESTIONS SO WITH

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.250
AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.986
YOUR PRESENTATION- EIGHT. YEAH%

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.755
I GUESS I WILL AND HE DID TOUCH

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.023
ON MANY OF THE QUESTIONS-

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.324
QUESTIONS I HAD ABOUT. NICOTINE

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:33.959
ITSELF BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.662
TO REMEMBER THAT- VAPING

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:38.764
PRODUCT IS A NICOTINE PRODUCTS

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.734
SO. ONE CAN ARGUE WHETHER IT'S

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.168
BETTER OR WORSE THAN.

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:44.236
COMBUSTION BUT THE REAL

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.938
QUESTION IS DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY.

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.506
FINALLY GET OFF THE NICOTINE

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:48.974
AND SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE TELLING

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.310
ME THE ANSWER IS NO DATE FOR BY

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.878
ME TO MAYBE. DEREK TOTAL

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.446
EXAMPLES BUT- IN GENERAL WE'RE

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:55.914
NOT SEEN THAT BASICALLY TO

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:56.982
SWITCHING ONE PRODUCT FOR

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:58.250
ANOTHER CORRECT. THAT IS

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.318
CORRECT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.352
TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:01.320
TO MULTIPLE SUBSTANCES

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:02.888
INCLUDING NICOTINE THEY WILL

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:04.056
INVARIABLY TELL YOU THAT IT IS

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.524
NOT THE CALL CAME. IT IS NOT

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:08.994
THE HEROIN. IT IS THE NICOTINE

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:09.595
THAT IS THE HARDEST THING FOR

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:10.429
THEM TO QUIT. SO ME JUST-

00:17:10.496 --> 00:17:11.764
PERHAPS SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.332
HERE AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.566
GOT STRAIGHT SO WHAT SO THE

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:15.901
CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT WHAT THE

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:20.038
VAPING. WE HAVE USE. WHO MAY

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:22.374
NOT HAVE SMOKE BEFORE WHO

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:26.245
ATTRACTED TO A PRODUCTS PERHAPS

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.347
THEN AND MADE EASIER TO BE

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:31.984
INTRODUCED BECAUSE OF FLAVORS.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.053
BUT NOW THAT DAVIS TRIED IT AND

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.722
I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.223
NICOTINE SOMETIMES IT DOES AS

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.358
FAR HIGHER THAN THEY WOULD BE

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.826
EXPOSED TO IN COMBUSTIBLE

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.930
CIGARETTES. SO THEY WILL

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.832
PROBABLY SIXTEEN GIVEN ITS

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.434
ADDICTIVE QUALITIES WOULD YOU

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.270
SAY IF WE SEE ELIMINATED TAPING

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.105
THEY WOULD SIMPLY STOP RD WOULD

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:54.473
THEN SEEK OUT ALTERNATIVE

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.474
NICOTINE PRODUCTS LIKE

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:57.876
COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES ARE EVEN

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.179
BY THE WAY EVEN UNFLAVORED-

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.747
VAPING PRODUCTS IF THEY WEREN'T

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:03.215
ABLE TO GET FLAVORED VAPING

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.850
PRODUCTS NOW THAT THERE ARE

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:06.518
THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.721
NICOTINE AND BRAINS I THINK

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:10.823
THAT THE- WE ARE SEEING THAT

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:13.058
ALREADY- SO IN TERMS OF THE

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.126
FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.794
OF THE CARTRIDGE BASED PRODUCTS

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:19.398
ON THE REUSABLE WE DO- HERE

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:19.998
ABOUT INDIVIDUALS FOR NOW SEEK

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.700
OTHER TYPES OF. BECAUSE THEY

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:23.535
ARE THE AN UNFORTUNATEBE I'M

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:25.704
PARTICULARLY IN THE WE DON'T

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.639
HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN TERMS

00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:30.008
OF BEST WAYS TO GET PEOPLE TO

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:30.609
QUIT THESE PRODUCTS A YOU SEE

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:31.677
WHEN WE COME UP WITH-

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:33.879
APPROACHES FOR CESSATION WE

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.013
USUALLY WANT TO HAVE A LOT OF

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.950
EVIDENCE BEFORE WE THE EYES

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:38.484
THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE A

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.020
KILLER PRO I'M WHICHMEANS MY

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:44.490
CONTROL TRYING TO RESEARCH

DOING THAT SO I. IT IS TRUE

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.070

INTERIM I THINK THAT IT'LL BE

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.406
REALLY CRITICAL FOR US TO COME

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.307
UP WITH WAYS TO HELP THESE

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:04.209
INDIVIDUALS- ON WOMEN'S SELF

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.477
OFFER THIS ADDICTION. AND AGAIN

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:06.411
PART OF IT IS A RECOGNITION

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.347
THAT THE ERROR ADDICTED TO MUCH

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:09.181

OF- EXPOSURE AT THE AGES THAT

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:22.928
THEY'RE BEING EXPOSED TO SO WE

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.496
SEE PEOPLE STARTING BE PAYING

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:45.050
SIGNIFICANT ON GOING ON THAT IS

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.184
LIKELY THE CASE AND IT'S NOT SO

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.719

DOWN LIKE WHAT WE DOING RIGHT.

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.756

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:52.757
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:55.493
ABSOLUTELY TO YOUR POINT- IT

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.427
COULD BE DUE TO BEHAVIOR CHANGE

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.728
SO INDIVIDUALS MAY BE

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.263
RESPONDING. BEING ARE AT AT

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.432
ADVICE THAT THEY STOP EATING

THOSE PRODUCTS THAT THEY GET

00:35:04.135 --> 00:35:05.369
FROM THE INFORMAL MARKET IS

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:09.540

PEOPLE NOT USING THOSE AND ALSO

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:18.850
POTENTIALLY THAT MOVING OUT OF

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.651
THE MARKET- MAKES IT MORE LESS

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:21.786
LIKELY THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:24.555
EXPOSED TO IT- BUT- AS I

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:25.990

POPULAR WITH USE- SOMETIMES

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.050

THIS LEAVING PLAY AND THE

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.075
CHOICES THEY MAKE IN THAT CASE.

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:19.544
SO IT A COUPLE OF THE POINTS

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.612
YOU MAKE FIRST OF ALL. IN THE

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:22.980

ACTUALLY RIGHT USE THESE

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.418

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.453

YOUNG ADULTS THAT IS THAT IS

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.293
WHERE THE PREPONDERANCE OF USED

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:40.932
IS. WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING.

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.500
USING YOUTH THEY WEREN'T USING

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.735
IT BEFORE THEY'RE NOT USING IT

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:46.437
TO SORT OF WEAN OFF OF ANY

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:47.838
PRODUCTS SO THERE'S NO ARGUMENT

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.840
THAT CAN BE MADE FOR USE IN

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:52.910
THAT SENSE- IN ADULTS WE HAVE

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.512
AS MENTIONED EARLIER A NUMBER.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.014

FOREMOST FOR THOSE ADULTS THAT

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.625
VERY SMALL PERCENT OF ADULTS

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.926
OVER THE AGE OF THIRTY WHO

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.161
ACTUALLY USING THESE PRODUCTS

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.395
FOR SMOKING CESSATION THERE ARE

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:13.464

THEIR CERTAINLY ON THE MARKET

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:18.169
PLACE FOR THEM. SO TO JUSTIFY

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:18.936
KEEPING FLAVORED PRODUCTS

BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE REALLY

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:31.788
UNDERSTAND THAT TOBACCO

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.557
RETAILERS WHEN THEY NEED TO

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:34.724
ADJUST AS WELL WE'VE GIVEN THEM

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.593

TO BUY ANYMORE- BEYOND WIND

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.869
DECEMBER ORDINANCE PASSED. BUT

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.537
ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THERE'S

REALLY NOT A LOT OF- FDA

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.043
APPROVED TOBACCO CESSATION-

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:54.878

APPROPRIATE ON- BUT I THINK THE

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.826
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS REALLY

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.361
PREVENTING YOU FROM GETTING
