GOOD MORNING AND- THANK YOU FOR HEARING US THIS MORNING- THERE AS- DOCTOR EXAM HERE MENTION THIS IS A AND A WONDERFUL PROGRAM- THAT THAT ALLOWS- PEOPLE WITH- SPEECH DISABILITIES TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE AND THAT'S IT. A PILOT PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW- THERE WERE SOME INITIAL DELAYS IN ROLLING OUT THE PROGRAM- LAST LAST YEAR- WE REQUESTED- AN EXTENSION OF THE REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY AGAIN- AND WE WERE SCHEDULED TO. START THE PILOT ON- MARCH FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND WE ALL KNOW- WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH CO ED- NOT TO MENTION WILDFIRES AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS- IN SO THERE WAS SOME DELAY LAST YEAR AS WELL- WHICH WHICH IS WHY WE'RE REQUESTING AN EXTENSION OF THE REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY. I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO ROLL OUT THE PILOT- WITH A START DATE OF JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- THAT DELAY WAS DUE TO. REALLY SHIFTING TO. PROVIDE THE SIR. REMOTELY DEMONSTRATING- SERVICES REMOTELY- AND THE LIKE- WE HAVE- WE HAVE SUB CONTRACTED WITH- TWELVE PROVIDERS CURRENTLY IN TWENTY ONE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- OUR GOAL.

THE POTENTIAL PILOT PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE SPEECH GENERATING DEVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC WHICH- YOU KNOW MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VALUABLE SERVICE STRING AT A CRITICAL TIME. HOWEVER WE DO RECOGNISE THE- THE COP THE CONTRACTED AS SERVICES- OFTEN THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS- WE DO RECOGNIZE WHY STAFF HAD TO SORT OF SCALE BACK SERVICES DURING DURING THIS TIME DUE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES THE CERTAINLY I THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN THE IT THE IMPACT OF COVERT ON ON AND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY- AND ESPECIALLY IN OUR- ARE A POPULATION WHO- OF RT RT ED HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH COMMUNICATION SO.

ADDRESS WHAT WAS OCCURRING IN JANUARY WE HAD PUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO SUPPLEMENT LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BRING PARITY ACROSS THE COUNTIES WERE FURTHER EXPANDING IT BY AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS REALLY GETS BACK ON TRACK TO THE EFFORTS WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE LEGISLATURE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC OF THREE YEARS OF FINDING TO GET UP TO. A LEVEL FUNDING FOR THE LOCAL CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND JUST IDENTIFIES HOW THAT FIFTY SIX MILLION WILL BE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES OF WHICH THERE ARE A FEW MORE THAN OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION BECAUSE OF RISING COSTS AND THE REDUCTION OF THE LOCAL TRUCKS REYES YOU TEND TO TAKE DURING. THE AND- OKAY. THE PART OF FINANCE. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT. THANK YOU. BELIAU THANK YOU PROCEED WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AS THE STATE WAS GRAPPLING WITH SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS- IN LIGHT OF COPING NINETEEN LAST YEAR HE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET WITH A NUMBER FUNDING REDUCTIONS INCLUDING- I NINETEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND- REDUCTION TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES HOWEVER GIVEN THAT- BUDGET CONDITIONS ARE BETTER THAN EXPECTED ANDTHIS TIME AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET DID PROPOSED TO RESTORE A PORTION. OF AND THE FUNDING REDUCTION. I'M NOW COUPLED WITH THE SPRING FIVE. HE I MEAN WHETHER THE METHODOLOGY FULLY MAXIMIZES PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES AND BEST PRACTICES- WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING ANY FUNDING INCREASES BEYOND THE RESTORATION AT THIS TIME THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THESE AND ANY OTHER ISSUES. WITH THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY PRIOR TO MAKING ANY ADDITIONAL FUTURE FUNDING REQUESTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YEAH AND MY COUNTY IS ON HERE AND I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT ABOUT- THIS METHODOLOGY AND- AND THE IMPACT WHEN COUNTIES AREN'T FUNDED. PROPERLY SO I AM GLAD TO SEE WE'RE WORKING ON THIS AND I HOPE WE AT MOVE EVEN FURTHER IN THIS SPACE AS WE CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES. DEPEND THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE L. AS REMARKS AND I JUST I DO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR NOW. BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND- SAID THAT HE THAT MY REMARKS BACK WHEN- THE CUTS ARE PROPOSED RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENT FINANCIAL SITUATION WHERE AN- AD MAKE NOTE THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN- CHILD SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY. BRING IN MORE RESOURCES TO FAMILIES SO. I KNOW THAT WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH COUNTIES AND DEVELOPING THIS FUNNY METHODOLOGY WHICH NOW FORTUNATE BE FULLY FUNDED. AT THE PURPOSE WAS ACTUALLY TO MAXIMIZE ITS ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE'RE PROVIDING FAMILIES AND- AND SO THIS IS VERY GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO DO SO AND TO CORRECT- SERVE HISTORICAL. INEQUITIES AND- IN IN TERMS OF- COUNTY SUPPORT FOR. THE CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH CREATE THIS MOVING FORWARD AND- ALSO I WOULD MAKE NOTE ARE ISSUE NUMBER TWO WILL BE ALSO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS VERY ISSUES I'M TRYING TO MAXIMIZE- THE FUNDING. FOR AGAIN FAMILIES AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY- OKAY THEN LET'S MOVE ON TO THAT NEXT- COMPONENT AND- AND YES AND WE ARE GLAD TO SEE. THIS COMING FORWARD AND SO WE'RE TO ASK THE L. A. O. TWO PERCENT. ON THE US SOME SENATE BUDGET OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE STATE IN FOR IT AND- PUT IT DEBT ON LOW INCOME RESIDENTS ELIA. AND WE WERE ASKED TO READ THE SENATE DEMOCRATS BUDGET PROPOSALS I'M OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA AND OUR REMARKS WILL LARGELY BE LIMITED TO WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE AGENDA- ALSO GIVEN THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ARE RELATIVELY NEW TO US WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER. ALL QUESTIONS BUT WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO STAFF AND MEMBERS AS NEEDED. I'M SO IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM- SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE AGENDA THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE AND OUR EXPANSION UNCOLLECTIBLE CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. OWED TO THE GOVERNMENT. INCLUDING A TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL TO CEASE ENFORCEMENT OF A REAR ENGINE IS DUE TO THE STATE. WHEN THE PARENTS SOLE INCOME. SOURCE OF INCOME IS FROM SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME OR STATE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENT BENEFITS ALSO KNOWN AS ISIS ISIS P. CASH ASSISTANCE FOR AGE BLIND AND DISABLED LEGAL IMMIGRANTS BENEFITS ALSO KNOWN AS CAPPY. A COMBINATION OF EXERCISES P. AND SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS OR VETERANS ADMINISTRATION DISABILITY BENEFITS. NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NOT ELIMINATE ANY DAY AT ANY DEBT OWED TO FAMILIES ONLY DEBT OWED TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. IN ADDITION TO WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE MENTIONED TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL TO CEASE ENFORCEMENT. UNCOLLECTIBLE GOVERNMENT DEBT OWED DEBT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I JUST MENTIONED I'M WAS ULTIMATELY WITHDRAWN BY THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR AS A RESULTS TO THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES. OF COPING NINETEEN AT THE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS A THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR AWHILE AND I KNOW DOCTOR PAN HAS BEEN I HAD A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS AS WELL- THIS IDEA OF- AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT PORTANTINO CLEAR THAT THE- AS WE- IS THE SENATE'S PLAN TO BUILD BACK BOLDLY AND SIMPLY TRY TO. OF MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND ANNA AND MAKE SURE SAFETY NET IS STRONG AND THAT WE'RE NOT INTENDING FOR MONEY OWED TO FAMILIES TO GO AWAY BUT JUST THE MONEY- TO THE STATE. IN IN SOME WOULD SAY- THAT THESE THESE LOST OUR FROM- THAT POVERTY LAWS WE WANT TO TRY TOPUNISH PEOPLE AND SO THE DEBT THAT IS COLLECTED FROM FAMILIES. WORKING PARENTS OFTENTIMES ARE NEVER ALLOWS THEM TO GET AHEAD- SO TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE BE ABLE TO GET MORE TO THEIR FAMILIES AND NOT AS MUCH TO STATE PASSAGE THAT. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT'S- CAN CREATE A WHOLE FOR THE STATE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MONEY RIGHT NOW SO WHY DON'T WE USE IT TO BE ABLE TO. CARE FOR FAMILIES AND NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT- INTEREST HAS ACCRUED ON ON PAST THINGS. DR WE ALSO HAVE A PANELIST HERE AND- TO HELDER FROM DIVERT NOVA FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM HER FIRST IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT OUR PLAN BEFORE WE GO FORWARD. OKAY A SORE PANELISTS NOW WILL BE- WILL BE ON. IN STROOP STROKE HELP ME IN. THE STUHLDREHER CLOSE TOOL DREYER OKAY. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M IN A SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL IT'S GOOD FOR FAMILIES AND IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA REQUIRING PARENTS WITH VERY LITTLE INCOMES TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE COST OF SAFETY NET SERVICES HAS DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR FATHERS FOR MOTHERS AND FOR CHILDREN IN THESE IMPACTS FALL HARDEST ON LOW INCOME BLACK AND BROWN FAMILIES ACROSS OUR STATE IT'S A PRACTICE WHICH DOES FAR MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE PUNITIVE PENALTIES THAT SAID AND WHEN PARENTS CANNOT PAY THIS DEBT THAT GROWS AT ASTRONOMICAL RATES FROM A 10% INTEREST RATE SUCH AS SUSPENDING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE KNOCKING DOWN THEIR CREDIT SCORE MAKE IT VERY HARD- FOR PARENTS TO WORK AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS PRACTICE DIRECTLY TAKES MONEY AWAY FROM CHILDREN IN POVERTY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED US THE MOST A FEW YEARS AGO TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND SAN FRANCISCO WE COLLABORATED WITH PHILANTHROPIC PROGRAM- FOUNDATIONS THE STATE AND LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM. AND WE USE THE COOP PROGRAM TO PAY OFF THE GOVERNMENT JET OF THIRTY TWO PARENTS WE THOUGHT IF WE PAID OFF THIS GOVERNMENT DEBT THAT THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS IN THE STUDY WOULD MAKE LARGER AND MORE CONSISTENT PAYMENTS SINCE THEY KNEW THEIR PAYMENTS WERE GOING WHERE THEY SHOULD TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE. THEY WERE FATHERS LIKE A MAN NAMED JOE WHO PARTICIPATED JOE WAS STRUGGLING TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS GOVERNMENT OWED CHILD SUPPORT THAT HE WAS LIVING IN HIS VAN HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T PAY THIS GOVERNMENT THAT AND IT WAS HARD FOR HIM O HANG ON TO HIS JOB AS A SOCIAL SECURITY GUARD FROM HIS CREDIT WAS SHOT SO HE COULDN'T REALLY GET INTO N APARTMENT- AFTER THE GOVERNMENT. DEBT WAS PAID OFF THROUGH THIS PROGRAM I'M JOE GOT DRIVER'S BACK AND HE WENT TO FOR. HE WAS TO GO INTO AN APARTMENT HE TO ME ABOUT YOUR TO HE WAS MORE TIME WITH HIS KIDS BECAUSE YOU COULD AFFORD TO DO THINGS WITH THEM. LIKE TAKE THEM TO GET ICE CREAM OR GO TO THE MOVIES HE WAS ALSO SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER PREVIOUSLY HE WAS JUST DROPPING HIS KIDS OFF AND THEN TAKING OFF IN HIS CAR. NOW THEY WOULD CHECK OUT OF THAT AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP IMPROVED AND EVERYTHING HE WAS PAYING WENT TO HIS CHILDREN AND TO HER AND NOT TO THE GOVERNMENT. THE STUDY BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE FOUND THAT WHEN WE GOT RID OF THIS GOVERNMENT THAT PARENTS MADE LARGER AND MORE CONSISTENT PAYMENTS HOW DO YOU SPELL YOUR STUDENT REQUIREMENTS. THEIR CREDIT SCORES WENT UP AND THEY HAD MORE STABLE HOUSING AND IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PARENTS AND CPARENTS. SO I SUPPORT ANY EFFORT TO REALLY LIFT THE BURDEN OF THIS GOVERNMENT YEAH. FAMILIES SIMPLY CANNOT IT. I THINK THE- TO AUTOMATICALLY LIMIT THIS GOVERNMENT- DEBT. FOR FOLKS WHO ARE JUST GETTING BY ON SOCIAL SECURITY OR SSI IS SO IMPORTANT I RECENTLY SPOKE TO A GRANDFATHER. FREDDIE PERSONS WHO LIVES IN THE BAYVIEW AND SAN FRANCISCO. HE'S GOT SPOTTED ON A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK AND UNTIL RECENTLY WE WERE GARNISHING AS A STATE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OF HIS CHECK. THAT WENT TO THE GOVERNMENT IT DIDN'T GO TO HIS KIDS IT DIDN'T GO TO HIS FAMILY AND IT MADE IT VERY HARD FOR MR PERSONS TO GET BY. SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO REALLY HELP. FOLKS LIKE MRPERSONS AND LIKE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE STRUGGLING UNDER THE BURDEN OF THIS STAT. THIS AUTOMATIC SOLUTION TO LIST THIS STAT BOB PEOPLE GETTING BY THESE MEANS TESTED BENEFITS. IS THE FIRST STEP BUT WE NEED TO GO MUCH FURTHER AS A STATE AND ELIMINATE THIS GOVERNMENT- DEBT ENTIRELY. THAT'S WHAT'S BEST FOR FAMILIES IN POVERTY AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEST. FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY. I THINK A YEAH I DID THINK WHEN THE WHEN THEY WANT ONE ARE SENATE CAME UP WITH A PLAN BILL BACK BOLDLY THIS IS A DRASTIC OF THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- WHAT KIND OF CONCRETE THINGS CAN WE DO TO RELEASE THE BURDEN. ON OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES THAT CAN. NO THANK YOU THANK YOU CARE EGGMAN- YEAH IT. FIRST OF ALL CERTAINLY S. STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD MAKE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY AND- WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS. WE ALSO THINK. EVEN FOR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE SO EVEN FROM A STRICTLY FINANCIAL STANDPOINT- WHEN WE DE MOTIVATE PEOPLE FROM ESSENTIALLY BE ABLE TO PAY BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THAT THE MONEY THEY'RE PUTTING INTO SPAIN GARNISH OR PUTTING THE END IS NOT ACTUALLY SUPPORTING THEIR- THEIR- THEIR- THEIR CHILDREN- BUT INSTEAD IS BEING. TAKEN OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN THE END NOT ONLY THAT MONEY NOT GETTING TO THE CHILDREN IT DIDN'T. BUT WE END UP PAYING FOR IT ANYWAY- I MEAN THROUGH OUR OTHER PROGRAMS. AND SO- IT INSTEAD WHAT WE JUST DO IS WE- WE HAVE A CIRCULAR THING GOING ON WITH HER. OKAY FINE WE TAKE MONEY WE STICK IT IN SOME ACCOUNT BUT THEN WE'RE SPENDING OTHER STATE MONEY- AND ALSO LOCAL MONIES TO HELP PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE FAMILIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT. ABLE TO GET BECAUSE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THEM IT'S GOING TO THE STATE. AND I THINK THE- SO WE REALLY SHOULD LOOK WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE POLICIES REALLY ABOUT- WHAT THE NET EFFECT REALLY IS ON THE STATE SO FOR DOES FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY BE LISTENING AND SAYING WELL GEE YOU KNOW WHAT. ISN'T THIS GOING TO COST THE STATE MONEY. AND AGAIN SOMEONE CAN DO THE COUNTING ON THIS I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT WILL COST THE STATE A LOT LESS MONEY THAN IT MAY SEEM LIKE ON. THE FRONT BECAUSE IN THE END WE ARE PAYING. OUT FOR THIS AS WELL SO EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T WORK OUR NATION AND AGAIN- THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THESE DEBTS- CERTAINLY WELL IT'S TO BE BLIND YOU KNOW IF YOU KNEW THAT THE MONEY THAT YOU'RE PAYING WASN'T ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP SUPPORT YOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD WAS JUST GOING INTO A- YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT PARDEE PILIS MOTIVATED TO WORK THAT EXTRA. A LITTLE HARDER- THINGS AND OF COURSE I APPRECIATE THE PAST- THIS- STILL DREYER TALK TALKING ALSO ABOUT- HOW THIS DEBT ALSO- YOU DON'T TAX. THE PERSON'S LIFE IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY TO ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THE CHILDREN LESS ABLE TO GET. YOU KNOW WORK- TO ACTUALLY HURDLE LIVING WOULD HAVE HELP THEM. ALSO PAY FOR CHAO SUPPORT SO- I. THAT AS WE HAVING THIS. OF THIS THIS NOT BE FRAMED- AS A- WELL LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND X. AMOUNT OF STATE DOLLARS FOR- LET YOU KNOW. FOR WAVING THE DATA WE'RE GOING TO COLLECT LESS STATE DOLLARS FOR WAITING THIS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE TRUE COST. OF THIS POLICY. EVEN FROM A STRICTLY FINANCIAL POINT OF VIEW I THINK THAT WE STILL WIN IN THE END BY ELIMINATING THE STAT. I WOULD CERTAINLY ARGUE THAT- FINANCIAL PLUS THE OTHER OF THE OTHER- IMPACT IT HAS ON FAMILIES THAT WE DEFINITELY I BELIEVE WOULD COME OUT AHEAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WE THANK YOU THAT. MS IN CHURCH ROAD RARE FOR HERE A FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND- AND ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE DONE OVER YOUR LIFETIME BUT MOST RECENTLY IN INSISTS IN SAN FRANCISCO.

A. O. A TO PREVENT PRESENT THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND AS YOU JUST NOTED THE SUB COMMITTEE ASKED OUR OFFICE TO PRESENT THE PROPOSED THESE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD BY THE SENATE DEMOCRATS. AND THE SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE SERVICES TO THE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY COMMUNITY- ALL THE PROVIDING A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THESE PROPOSALS AND WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE MORE DETAILS IN TODAY'S HEARING AGENDA. AS WELL AS FROM THE HEARING AGENDA FROM FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD. SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE FUNDING SUSPENSIONS FOR SPECIFIC PROVIDER RATE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET AX AND PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE- IN ADDITION IT WOULD ELIMINATE FUNDING SUSPENSIONS FOR IN THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AND PROVIDE ON GOING FUNDING TO PERMANENTLY END OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. THE SECOND PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND OR ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO DO THE FOLLOWING. ONE ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS. THE SECOND TWO WOULD ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR IN PERSON SERVICE COORDINATION MEETINGS AND EARLY START SERVICES. THE THIRD WOULD ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES TO UTILIZE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES FOR PERSONAL ASSISTANCE INDEPENDENT LIVING AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT.

NUMBER FIVE ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASE UTILIZATION OF THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES AND NUMBER SIX BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS AS RECOMMENDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN DDS FENDER RATE STUDY. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN- WITH THE SENATE. THE SENATE DEMS PLAN TO BUILD BACK BELIEVE THE AND IN MAKING SURE THAT WE- REALLY TAKE CARE OF THOSE IN OUR SAFETY NET THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME I'M TALKING ABOUT OR- OR- IDT COMMUNITY AND- THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THAT CODE HAS- HAS PRESENTED WITH TO THEM BUT ALSO- THE HISTORIC. STORABLE LACK OF FUNDING AND- MMHM SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS CARE FOR. THE THOSE WHO WHO MAY NEED MORE CARE SO THIS ONE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HEARD ABOUT ABOUT. THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND PAYS FOR OUR OUR OUR OUR PROVIDERS- GOING TO GET RID OF THOSE SUSPENSIONS HERE PEOPLE ARE PAID OR OR- IF REQUIRED TO WORK. ON HOLIDAYS TAKEN AWAY PEOPLE'S HOLIDAYS ON THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE VIRTUAL MEETINGS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT OPEN- ALSO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. CLIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH MORE RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE ARE CAN SELF DIRECT AND THEN FINALLY PROVIDING PATHWAYS FOR. A DISTANCE CARE GIVER COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN EVEN MORE SKILL TRAINING. TO CREATE A REAL SKILL AT PATHWAY GOING FORWARD SO PEOPLE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THIS IMPORTANT CARE BUT TO GROW AND DEVELOP- SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES. AT THE SAME TIME- SO WE THINK THESE THINGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE A PANEL HERE TO ALSO TALK SOME MORE ABOUT THIS- WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE- AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SAY MORE FROM THE HE'S A SENIOR POLICY ADVISER FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS. WE HAVE BURIED GIORGINI EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES SOCIAL ASIAN AND JORDAN LINDSEY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU COULD ALL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS PROPOSALS. THAT THE SENATE DEMS HAVE PUT FORTH. START WITH USE WHITE. THANK HERO- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS STILL WHITE SEAL AND I AM HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC- PRESENTED OUR STATE NATION AND INDEED THE WORLD WITH EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES THAT. ONLY BEEN UNPRECEDENTED IN NATURE AND- THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO LAID BARE THE NEED FOR SYSTEM WIDE CHANGES IN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM WHILE THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION IN THE SUB COMMITTEE. THE PANDEMIC FOR SOME CHANGES TO MEET THE URGENT NEEDS OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES INCLUDING POLICY AND PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITIES MANY OF WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE MAINTAINED EVEN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY FOR EXAMPLE THE INCREASE FLEXIBILITY WITH TELESERVICES TELEMEDIA MEANS PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES AND RATE ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY LABOR RATE. THESE FLEXIBILITIES HAVE PROVIDED A CRITICAL LIFELINE TO CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES THAT MOST THAT MOST NEED SUPPORT AND WE BELIEVE THESE I SHOULD BECOME PERMANENT- WITH REGARDS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER APPROVAL PROCESS HAS BEEN. HAS LONG BEEN A PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM WHILE AT DDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE TIMELINE TO ISSUE APPROVALS DELAYS STILL OCCUR APPROVING HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOT ONLY HAS- SPEAKS NOT ONLY SPEEDS UP BUT ALSO PUTS THEM IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO BEST KNOW THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WITH REGARDS TO VIRTUAL MEETINGS UNDER THAT CALIFORNIA'S EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ACT REQUIRING IN PERSON SERVICES WHERE WAIT TO ALLOW FOR TELESERVICES DO TO COPE AND- THIS REALLY ENABLED IN PRINCETON TODDLERS TO RECEIVE SERVICES LIKE SPEECH THERAPY. BERKELEY ONE REQUESTED BY A PARENT GUARDIAN OR OTHER LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. AGAIN WHILE THIS WAS DONE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COBIT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WERE INDEED FOUND BY FAMILIES INSPECT EFFORTS INCLUDE NOT HAVING TO PARTICIPATE IN TRANSPORTATION THE CHILD'S INCREASED COMFORT BEING IN THE FAMILY HOME. AND FOR FAMILIES WITH MULTIPLE CHILDREN PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE CARE GIVERS TO ACCESS SERVICES. ALSO IT WOULD PARTICIPATE WITH REGARDS TO PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND RECOGNITION THAT TRADITIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY HAS BEEN DISRUPTED LEADING MANY CONSUMERS WITHOUT ANY SERVICES AT ALL. DDS AS MENTIONED EARLIER AT TEMPORARILY EXPANDED PARTICIPANT DIRECTED SERVICES TO INCLUDE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. THESE FLEXIBILITIES AFFORDED BY THIS MODEL ARE KEY TO REDUCING PURCHASED SOME SERVICE DISPARITIES BECAUSE- IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES TO FIND PROVIDERS THAT SPEAKER PREFERRED LANGUAGE AND PROVIDE. AND FIND PROVIDERS DURING THE HOURS FOR WHICH SERVICES ARE NEAT. AND FINALLY- WITH REGARDS TO GENERIC SERVICE SAYS THAT DESPITE REGIONAL CENTERS RESPONSIBILITIES TO IDENTIFY AND PURSUE ALL POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR CONSUMERS. SERVICE COORDINATORS HAVE OFTEN PLACED THE BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS WITH IDT AND THEIR FAMILIES IS TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF CARE TO FULLY EXHAUST THESE FUNDING STREAMS THEIR GENERIC AGENCIES. AND SOMETIMES EXHAUSTION MEANS ATTAINING A WRITTEN NOTICE OTHER TIMES IT MEANS GOING PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL AND THE END RESULT IS OFTEN THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH ID P. AND THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN GIVE UP AND GO WITHOUT THE NEEDED SERVICE BECAUSE- THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE REGIONAL CENTER REQUIREMENTS TO PURSUE CROSS THE SERVICES. AND THROUGH AND GO THROUGH GENERIC AGENCIES. ADDITIONALLY THE RESOLUTION PROCESS FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO CARE SERVICES FROM GENERIC AGENCIES IS UNDER UTILIZED. AND UN NECESSARILY LIMITED TO CHILDREN UNDER SIX YEARS OF AGE WE ARE PROPOSING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM AND CONTINUE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS TOWARDS THIS GOAL. LOWS IN WHILE THE DIRECTIVES WERE ISSUED THESE DIRECTIVES WERE ISSUED IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. THESE FLEXIBILITIES HAVE REALLY MADE LIFE MUCH EASIER FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA BELIEVES FIRMLY THAT IT WOULD JUST BE UNFAIR TO STRIP CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES OF THESE IMPROVED ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES AND BENEFITS THEY RELY ON. AND WE ASK THAT YOU WOULD MAKE PERMANENT THESE DIRECTIVES AND SUPPORT OTHER SYSTEM WIDE CHANGES SUCH AS THE SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO GENERIC. CRITICAL GENERIC RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF WE COULD NOW HEAR FROM AB BERRY JERRY. ON TO DISCUSS THE EXPECTED IMPACT THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE UTILIZATION OF THE P. I. P. AND THE CIA PROGRAMS. ON IDENTITY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE VERY CHARGING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON OUR TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT INCENTIVES- THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WE BELIEVE OUR PROPOSAL- WILL WILL HELP MOVE FORWARD AND YOU KNOW PUT A JUMP START ON STARTING TO RECOVER SOME OF THE LOSSES THAT WE SEEN AN EMPLOYMENT- DURING THE PANDEMIC AND REALLY BUILD ON SOME OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE WERE SEEING- BEFORE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY- SO. PRIMARILY ARE ARE CHANGE ON THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM HAS TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS IT WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE- THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO INTERNS IN THE PROGRAM BY REMOVING A STRICT EARNINGS CAP OF TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED. AND INSTEAD IMPLEMENTING AN HOUR'S CAP WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION WAS BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- WHEN THEY'RE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WAS WAS CHAPTER- BY MOVING IT BACK TO IT. AS MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN THE STATE THE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROGRAM HAS DECREASED PROPORTIONATELY- BASED ON THAT STREET EARNINGS CAP SO BASICALLY WE'VE LOST 30% OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS THROUGH THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AS WE'VE SEEN THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE FROM TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TO THE CURRENT. A THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN AN HOUR- ADDITIONALLY- WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING TO ALLOW FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEE TO BE PROVIDED TO- SERVICE PROVIDERS TO HELP FACILITATE AND MAKE MORE MAKE A BROADER NETWORK OF PROVIDERS ELIGIBLE AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLIENTS IN THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM CURRENTLY. THEY HAVE TO DO THAT AT A LOSS- MAN YOU'RE DOING IT ANYWAYS BUT NEVERTHELESS- WE'RE WE'RE PROPOSING 15% ADMIN FEE WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR OTHER SERVICES IN OUR SYSTEM- ON THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT IT'S AND INSTRUCTOR FOR. IT UP OF EXISTING INCENTIVE. REALLY IS A WAY TO TRY TO JUMP- SOME OF THAT EMPLOYMENT LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE. SOME OF THE UNFUNDED COSTS- THAT GO INTO ATTAINING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND FINDING GOOD PLACEMENTS THINGS LIKE JOB DISCOVERY- EMPLOYMENT EXPLORATION. AND SOME OF THE SOFT SKILLS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL AND COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. SO THOSE ARE SERVICES THAT NOW ARE NOT FUNDED UNDER THE SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT RATE- THE SUPPORT EMPLOYMENT RATE GOES SPECIFICALLY TO JOB COACHING. AND WE ALREADY KNOW BASED ON THE RATE STUDY OF TWO YEARS AGO THAT SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT IS UNDERFUNDED BY OVER 36% THAT WAS WHAT WAS FOUND IN THE RATE STUDY AND I BELIEVE MANAGER YOU SPOKE TO SOME OF OUR UNDERSTANDING IN OUR SYSTEM- IN AN EMPLOYMENT SERVICES. OUR OUR NEW NO STRANGER TO THAT SO WE BELIEVE THAT THESE- THESE TWO- CAN JOIN PROPOSALS WILL AGAIN JUMPSTART AND WE WILL SEE. SOME GROWTH WE WERE SEEN PROGRESS IN THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CARE LIKE I SAID. BUT WE STILL UNDERSTAND CONSIDERABLY ON THE TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL APPROPRIATION- TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAMS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THESE THESE PROPOSALS GO INTO PLACE THAT COULD BE STILL DONE UNDER THAT EXISTING TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR PREPARATION WE'RE NOT EVEN ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION YOUR TIME THIS MORNING AND. AND HAVING ON THE AGENDA VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU VERY I THINK THAT ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE UPON COMMON TO THE HUMAN EXPERIENCES DESIRE TO KNOW THAT WE ARE VALUED. AND I THINK HAVING THESE INTEGRATED WORK PROGRAMS JUST PROVIDES ONE MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE IN THE DD COMMUNITY TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE VALUE. AND I THINK THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY BOTH AS A GOVERNMENT AS A SOCIETY TO PROVIDE AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES AS WE CAN. FOR PEOPLE TO FEEL VALUED AND INTEGRATED PART OF OUR SOCIETY SO WE THANK YOU FOR THIS UP THE SPINE PROPOSAL AND ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO. A I KNOW A- AS- DESERVE A REALLY IMPORTANT INTERESTING SPACE TO BE ABLE TO WORK IN IN. IN HELPING PEOPLE INCREASE THEIR SKILLS AND- REJOINING GO OUT INTO THE WORK FORCE. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT- IF WE CAN HEAR FROM MISTER JORDAN LINDSAY PLEASE- AND- ON THE NEXT ISSUE. HER AUNT AND REPOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IT'S AN. HONOR TO BE WITH YOU TODAY- IN THIS A BIG. MY NAME IS JORDAN AND SAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE R. CAN YOU NOT POLICY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIONS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ON THE CHALLENGES OF THE WORK FORCE- IN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TRANSPORTATION DSPS- IS SO JUST QUIT A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AS A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DSP IS SOMEONE WHO WORKS DIRECTLY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. D. S. P. IS AIM TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN REALIZING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THEY HELP PEOPLE BECOME INTEGRATED AND ENGAGED IN THEIR COMMUNITY IN THE PAST DSPS WERE TRAINED AS CARE GIVERS BUT OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES THE NEEDS OF THOSE BEING SERVED HAS HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED THE ROLES OF INDIA'S PIAS HAS CHANGEDNOW INDIA'S PEACE TAKE ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS AND ROLES OTHER THAN JUST CARE GIVING IS NO LONGER ABOUT DOING THINGS FOR PEOPLE BUT RATHER IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUAL TO LEARN HOW TO. REACH. THEIR POTENTIAL AND DO THINGS FOR THEMSELVES. THROUGHOUT THE FEEL OF DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE ROLE OF DSPS IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT WHICH IS DIFFERENT IN CARE GIVING. AND CARE GIVER WILL DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE LIKE PICK UP GROCERIES IN CONTRAST DSP WILL WORK WITH SOMEONE TO ENABLE THEM TO DO THINGS INDEPENDENTLY. TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN GROCERIES. IN THIS WAY DSPS TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO DO THINGS INDEPENDENTLY AND THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR QUALITY SERVICES FROM A DSP GO FAR BEYOND. ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY LIVING THE DSP MUST ALSO BE A JOB COACH A COMMUNITY INTEGRATOR. IN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. IN OBSERVER OF HEALTH CARE CHANGES BEHAVIOR SPECIALIST- JOHN F. KENNEDY JUNIOR STATED THAT THAT QUALITY IS DEFINED AT THE POINT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STAFF MEMBER. IN THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE DISABILITY- AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS HOW DO WE INCREASE THE QUALITY AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE ARE RESPECTING AND- I'M GIVEN COMMITMENT TO THE DSP WORKFORCE- I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT WAS. THE BEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD. THREE YEARS AS A D. S. B. IT'S INCREDIBLE WORK SO QUICKLY WHO ARE THE DSPS IN CALIFORNIA WE ESTIMATE THERE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DSPS. 82% ARE WOMEN. 8% OR NOT WHITE. ONLY 7% OR SINGLE PARENTS. THIS PART IS TRAGIC 34% WORK MUST WORK TWENTY PLUS HOURS AT A SECOND JOB 34% US FOR TWENTY PLUS HOURS AT A SECOND JOB 36% ON MEDIC CAL THEMSELVES. I'M THROUGH THE CODEPENDENT MAKE WE HAVE SEEN THE S. P.'S BECOME HEROES THEY'RE ALREADY HEROES AND NOW WE ARE RECOGNIZING THAT FOR THEIR RESPONSE DURING THE PANDEMIC SACRIFICING SO MUCH OF THEMSELVES TO MAKE THEIR SAFETY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. OUT THE PANDEMIC I'M IT HAS TRULY BEEN INSPIRING TO SEE HOW DSPS EVER HAVE RESPONDED AND HAVE- ACTED SO HEROICALLY DURING DEPENDENT. BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM. FOR ALL THAT WE EXPECTED DSPS FOR HOW MUCH WE NEED DSPS WE DON'T. WE DON'T RESPECT THE S. B. AND THIS IS EVIDENCED BY A 50% TURNOVER RATE IN OUR SYSTEM OF DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE DSPS. WE DO NOT OFFER A CERTIFICATION WE DO NOT OFFER PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING AND WE CERTAINLY DO NOT PROVIDE. PAY FAIR WAGES FOR THE HEROISM THEY HAVE DISPLAYED IN FOR THEIR ONGOING SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIANS WITH ID DE WE BARELY PAY DSPS MINIMUM WAGE. THESE LOW WAGES ARE A RESULT OF THE LOW RATES THE STATE PAYS PROVIDERS- LOW WAGES IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS BUT THE LACK OF A CLEAR CAREER PATH IS ANOTHER. AND BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS THE IMPACTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES CAN BE DISASTROUS. AS A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THE PAST PRESIDENT OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO GO THROUGH FOR. FIVE OR SIX DS PEAS IN ONE YEAR FOR HER AND ALSO. HOW IS THAT. IS CALIFORNIA CONTENT WITH THAT. THAT'S THE QUESTION WE MUST ASK OURSELVES. INSTEAD I BELIEVE NOW IS THE TIME TO TELL THIS CRITICAL WORKFORCE THAT WE SEE YOU WE RESPECT YOU AND STARTING NOW WE'RE GOING TO ENABLE YOU TO BETTER SUPPORT THE CLIENTS THAT YOU ARE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT. THE ARC IN UCP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION ALONG WITH OUR BUT MANY MEMBERS OF THE LANCMAN COALITION PROPOSED THAT WE DO SO BY THE FALL. ONE CREATE A CERTIFICATION FOR DSPS THAT INCLUDES BEST PRACTICES TRAINING AND ONGOING EDUCATION. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY PRECEDENCE IN THIS STATE FOR CERTIFICATION FOR EXAMPLE CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT CNA AND CERTIFIED HOME HEALTH AIDES. ADDITIONALLY THE DDS RATE STUDY ALSO SUGGESTED CREATING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS A CHEER DSP CERTIFICATION PROCESS SUCH AS A D. S. P. ONE TWO ONE THREE BASED ON YOUR TRAINING. THERE ALREADY EXISTS TRAINING MODULES THAT ARE USED NATIONALLY THERE ARE LOCAL AD HOC CERTIFICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO TRY TO FILL THIS VOID SO THIS CAN BE DONE IT'LL TAKE WORK I'M SUCH AS FINALIZING THE CURRICULUM BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE AND WE SHOULD ACT BOLDLY TO DO SO. NUMBER TWO PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS IS TIED THE CERTIFICATION TO INCREASE WAGES THIS CREATES THE INCENTIVE FOR BETTER QUALITY AND OUTCOMES AS WELL AS BEGIN TO PAY MORE LIVABLE WAGE TO OUR DS PEAS THIS IS ALREADY BEING EXPLORED IN MANY OTHER STATES AND ENACTED IN SOME AS AN EXAMPLE THE STATE OF INDIANA I'M BAY INCREASE WAGES BY THREE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR FOR DSPS WILL COMPLETE. CERTIFIED TRAINING THESE INCREASE WAGES CAN EASILY BE ACHIEVED BY FOLLOWING SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DDS RATE STUDY TO PAY FAIR RATES AND THE THIRD AND FINAL PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS IS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION FOR THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING TO THEIR EMPLOYEES IT TAKES TIME AND MONEY FOR INDIVIDUALS COMPLETE THESE TRAININGS FOR EXAMPLE ASEAN IN CALIFORNIA. IS A HUNDRED HOURS- SO WE MUST INCLUDE FUNDING NOT ONLY FOR THE WAGE INCREASES FOR THE CERTIFICATION BUT ALSO FOR THE INITIAL TRAINING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DO THAT- TO COMPLETE THOSE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR HOWEVER MANY HOURS. YOU FOR DSP CERTIFICATION. CREATING THIS CREE PATH FOR. IS FOR FROM THE ONLY PRO. WE ARE PUSHING YEAR FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS INCLUDING A SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF THE ONE TIME AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS. AND REGULAR ONGOING BUDGET PROPOSAL SUCH AS IN THE AGENDA OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE SUSPENSIONS. I KNOW PROPOSALS ARE CERTAINLY BOWL. AND WILL BUILD BACK HOLDING- IT WILL BUILD BACK BELIEVE IT AVAILABLE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO GIVE ATTENTION TO ALL THOSE PROPOSALS AND CERTAINLY. OUR NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE KAROQ EFFORTS THAT THE U. S. P.'S- CODE RESPONSE. AND ALSO OUR COMMITMENT TO THEM AS WE BUILT BACK IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU VERY. MISTER LINDSEY I THINK THAT. WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR WE COVERED THIS LAST COUPLE MONTHS AGO- AND I THINK WE ALL HOPEFULLY WE HAVE RESPONDED WITH KIND OF HANNAH AND THESE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN GOOD AND WE ARE. FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL HOPEFULLY REALLY GOING TO ET FOLKS ON A PATH- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 50% TURNOVER RATE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE OF PEOPLE MAKING LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE WORKING LONG HOURS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS THEMSELVES AND AFFORDABILITY AND FOOD SECURITY AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO DO YOUR JOB. OR FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE BURN OUT EVEN HIGHER SO- YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK A LOT ABOUT OUR VALUES OF CARING FOR THOSE MOST VULNERABLE BUT- A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS. TAKES CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO SERVE AS WELL AS THOSE CARE GIVERS. AND FAMILIES AND IT JUST IT JUST HELPS THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO- WE ARE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO. FINALLY HAVE SOME FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON SOME ISSUES LIKE THIS. OCTOPATH THANK YOU- JERRY WHEN NIGHT- JUST- PROCEED- AGAIN OUR- PROPOSALS ARE MOVING FORWARD ESPECIALLY- WE'VE TALKED A LOT THIS YEAR BUT WE TALK EVERY YEAR HER ABOUT- ESPECIALLY THE FUNNY SUSPENSIONS BEING LEFT IN PLACE AND WHILE. THEY DON'T AFFECTED MEDIA BUDGET OF COURSE THAT. KEEPS OUR HEALTH EVEN SERVICES INCLUDING AT THE MOMENT THE SERVICES ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK- DURING DOWNTURNS. AS WELL SO- AND CERTAINLY TO OTHER- MEASURES I GUESS I WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT- CAN CERTAINLY PROUD THAT- HERE IN THE SENATE TO IN OUR BUDGET PROPOSALS AND- YOU KNOW BUDGETS ARE CHALLENGING BECAUSE STILL WE- THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO BE BALANCED AND LOUIS- AND SO. BUT WE I THINK IT'S USUALLY- YOU KNOW WE- WE'VE WE'RE USUALLY THE ONES TAKING THE STEPS TO TRY TO EXPAND AND INCREASE OUR SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE IN THE DE. COMMUNITY BEYOND WHAT. USUALLY IS PROPOSED- INITIALLY SO- SO I DO HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME RECOGNITION WEEK OF THE I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS DESIRED IT WE COULD JUST. TRY TO DO MORE BUT- BUT THAT CERTAINLY- HERE IN THE SENATE WE- ARE TO CONTINUE TO NOT JUST SOME PLEASE. ACCEPT WHAT'S PROPOSED BUT I CONTINUE TO PUSH TO.

OKAY DR GRANT NO OKAY WELL IF I KEPT. ALL RIGHT IF WE CAN MOVE ON TO- DOLLAR MASTER PLAN ON AGING. YES ISSUE THREE THIS SPRING BCBS THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IMPLEMENTATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY THERE WAS- IF YOU WILL A PLACE HOLDER FOR THIS- AND NOW WITH THE MASTER PLAN RELEASED THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY WERE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THAT I'M MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT IMPLEMENTATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IF I COULD STOP YOU ONE MINUTE MISBAH DIRECTOR- BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAD THE BILL THOSE GOALS RIGHT THAT AND SO I WAS GONNA ASK YOU IF YOU CAME IN ONE WEEK YOU TALK ABOUT THE- HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT IT IF YOU COULD MAYBE SPEAK TO THE GOAL THAT IS A DRESSING. WHICH AND AS YOU KNOW GOAL NUMBER ONE WAS HOUSING FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES GOAL NUMBER TWO WAS HEALTH REIMAGINE GOAL NUMBER THREE WAS INCLUSION AND EQUITY NOT ISOLATION GOAL NUMBER FOUR WAS CARE GIVING THAT WORKS IN GOAL NUMBER FIVE WAS AFFORDING AGING- SO. WE ADD USUALLY KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE ON AGING AND- THIS LAST TWO YEARS WE DEVELOPED THIS PLAN NOW WE GET TO IMPLEMENT IT SO- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE GREAT IDEAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IF YOU COULD MAYBE HELP US UNDERSTAND WHICH ONE OF THE GOALS IT FITS UNDER. YOUR AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT. OF THE NAMING OF THE FIVE. GOALS AND THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO. WHAT I WOULD SAY HERE WITH THIS IS A THIS IS ABOUT. IS ABOUT THE CAPACITY TO DO TWO THINGS. ONE IS TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE DID WE MEET THOSE GOALS TO REMAKE THOSE INITIATIVES ARE THE DATA DASHBOARD INDICATORS CHANGING SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PREVENT FALLS AND CAL IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO NATIONAL. METRICS ARE ARE FALL INVESTMENTS FALL PREVENTION INVESTMENTS AND HOME MODIFICATION INVESTMENTS. WORKING SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP WITH OUR- OUR DASHBOARD. OUR IMPACT STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEE OUR PROGRESS REPORTS WHICH- WE'RE CURRENTLY SERVING ALL THE CABINET RIGHT NOW TO FIND OUT HOW THEY'RE DOING. ALSO A BIG PIECE OF THE MASTER PLAN- INFRASTRUCTURE AT CDA IS AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY. ON MAKING SURE IT'S NOT JUST THE PLAN ON THE SHELF THAT WE ACTUALLY. DO AND THAT INCLUDES THE LOCAL PLAYBOOK WE WERE HOPING TO MOVE FROM. A THREE COUNTIES WITH MASTER PLANS FOR AGING TALK FIFTY EIGHT- THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR NOT SO OF OUR SPONSOR GOOGLE IN THAT AREA SO IT'S A LOT OF IT IS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD SAY- IF THE INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTATION. ANOTHER WONDERFUL THING ABOUT AGING AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS. FOR WHERE YOU SIT AS WE AS A IS. WORK SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES OPERATING YOU'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THE WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP HAPPENING AT OUR HOUSING AGENCY. THE TREASURER'S OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- AND PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING HOMES THERE ARE HOUSING OPTIONS. ALL ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS AND SO ONE OF THE- GOALS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING IS TO BE MORE OF THAT. A PERSON CENTRED VIEW THAT CAN CONECT THE WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE- AND ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OUR LAST FRIDAY. WE AND WITH SECRETARY KELLY CONVENES THE NEW COMMUNITY LIVING ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE. IF I GOT DISCOUNT RATE FIVE AGENCIES SEVEN DEPARTMENTS AND ONE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN ATTENDANCE- TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO. TO ACHIEVE HOLDING COMMUNITY LIVING. SEPARATELY WE WOULD HAVE POLICY POSITIONS- ARE AT ACTED APARTMENT AGING CREATING THIS NEW POLICY SHOP THAT WOULD LOOK AT THE HOUSING. CONTINUUM THAT WOULD LOOK AT ISOLATION AND ALL THAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF YES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK AND VOLUNTEER IN CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SO I WE BELIEVE THAT THAT POLICY SHOP IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDING THAT PERSON CENTERED. DOWN ALIGNMENT UP. OLDER ADULTS AS THEY SERVE. THE MANY DEPARTMENTS AGE. ARE AND MAYBE IT THE COURSE OF THEIR AGE- THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE PROVIDE THAT PERSON CENTRED PAULA. LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE GOALS- OTHER PIECES IN THERE INCLUDE- WE DON'T HAVE OUR AGING PROGRAMS AND DATA SYSTEMS YET- AND- THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT RIGHT FROM THE START. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT AN AGING SYSTEM FOR AGING AND DISABILITY DATA PROGRAMS THAT NOT ONLY WOULD ALLOW US TO PERFORMANCE MANAGE AND BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT DATA. BUT CRITICALLY CONNECTED COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES FOR AGING CRITICALLY CONNECT WITH HEALTH PLANS FOR AGING- WORK FOR BOTH THE TRIPLE A.'S IN THE IOC'S. SO THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. TO USE THAT TECHNOLOGICAL BACKBONE ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT- YEAH ONE STOP FOR CONSUMERS- WITH THE PROBE BUT BUT- NETWORKS TO WDSU. NITTY AND HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE PART OF. AND WHEN IT THERE BUT I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS AND THAT. THE YOUR CALL. YES IT YES IT DID YES IT DID- AND TELL ME HOW YOU LANDED ON THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS IS AS WERE AS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE BUILDING BACK BOLDLY. AND TELL ME HOW YOU LANDED ON ON THE FIVE IN A THREE AND- A AND TEN IS IT JUST. WE'RE GONNA START. YES IT'S REALLY TIED TO THIS TO YOUR WORK PLAN THAT WAS RELEASED THE TWO YEAR INITIATIVES AND WHERE THE FOCUS IS AND WHERE THE ATTENTION IS SO HOUSING WITH A PRIORITY AYE ISOLATION COMING OUT OF- THAT THAT THE TERRIBLE STATE HOME PERIOD EYES WITH HUGE PRIORITY SO WAS REALLY LINING UP WITH THE INITIATIVES FOR THE NEXT- TWO YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZE WHERE WE NEED CAPACITY- AND THEN THE I. T. ON SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE MORE TRADITIONAL WORK WITH. OUR COLLEAGUES IN FINANCE ON WORKLOAD AND CAPACITY AND OUR OUR CHIEF- OUR AGENCY INFORMATION OFFICER AT CHS ASK I CAN HAVE W. MORE QUICKLY CAN PROVIDE MORE ABOUT KIND OF THE WORKLOAD ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO THAT BUT IT WAS A LINE AT THE STRATEGIC LEVEL WITH THAT. THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MASTER PLAN. OKAY THANK YOU- OKAY ANTARCTICA. THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- I GUESS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY THE I. T. WORK- AND- WELL CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD MANY SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS HERE IN THE STATE- USUALLY WE WANNA BE SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT- SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE I. T. WORK IN A NOTE THAT FOR THE SPRING FINANCERS MAINLY ABOUT POSITIONS IS THIS ALL WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN HOUSE OR IS ARE THESE STAFF TO BE BROUGHT ON AND THAT WE'RE TO EXPECT A- A REQUEST FOR A CONTRACT AND YOU STILL BATES DOES IT WORK ALL IN HOUSE IT WORK THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE ORDERS ARE PLANS BY THE PART OF AGING TO THEN.
