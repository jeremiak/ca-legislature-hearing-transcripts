MEMBERS THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE VOTERS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION. AND A PROVISIONAL BALLOT ENVELOPE EVEN THOUGH. MUCH OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED ON BOTH FORMS IS IDENTICAL. BY MERGING TWO FORMS TO ONE FORM S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WILL SAVE MONEY AND STAFF TIME BY ALLOWING PROVISIONAL VOTERS TO REGISTER FULLY BY COMPLETING THE REQUESTED INFORMATION. ON A PROVISIONAL BALLOT ENVELOPE WITHOUT HAVING TO ADDITIONALLY FILL OUT A DUPLICATIVE AFFIDAVIT OF REGISTRATION. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY SECRETARY OF STATE. SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN DOCTOR CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZE.

THE INTEGRITY OR BY WHAT ELECTIONS SO PROCESS. AND THE CONSEQUENT DUTY YA UNDERMINE. VOTER OATH TRUST A IN NOW WHAT IT LACKS ON OUTCOMES. THIS BILL THE HOUSE SO SEVERAL PROBLEMS. IT WILL DIE MAKE IT EVEN EASIER. FOR UNSCRUPULOUS PERSONS SO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A CALIFORNIA SO ALREADY LACKS SUSTAIN DAY YOUR REGISTRATION SYSTEM. UNLIKE ALTHOUGH STATES ARE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REQUIRE A PERSON SO TO REGISTER ON ELECTION DAY TO PRESENT THE EVIDENCE SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY. RECITE THE IN THE DISTRICT OF THEY ARE LOOK TEMPTING. TO FOURTEEN THE OUT THERE ARE NO SAFEGUARDS TO PREVENT A PERSON'S SOUL WHILE ORGANIZED SO GROUPS ARE. WHAT PERSON SUFFER FROM NOT USING FORMS SO I DIDN'T IDENTITY AND THE ADDRESSES? FROM BOARDING UP MUCH PER TIME SAW IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS ARE IN OUR ELECTION DAY. ON THE ELECTION DAY [inaudible] POLITICS.

PLEASE JOIN ME IN VOTING NO ON THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. MS BAKER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY AND REALLY BECAUSE WHATEVER EFFICIENCIES MAYBE GANDER COST SAVINGS FROM. MERGING. TO VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN A REGISTRAR'S OFFICE PROVISIONAL BALLOT AND VOTER REGISTRATION IS LOST IN THE IMPORTANCE FOR ACCURACY IN WHAT YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY. I'M SCRUTINIZE ANY TO THOSE FORMS WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT. A VOTER REGISTRATION CARD THE ANALYSIS AT A REGISTRAR NEEDS TO GO THROUGH AND THEIR STAFF CAREFULLY. IS IS THIS VOTER A RESIDENT IN THIS DISTRICT DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO SCRUTINIZE HOWEVER IF THEY HAVE PROVIDED THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE. A PROVISIONAL BALLOT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT IN THE ENVELOPE ON A PROVISIONAL BALLOT HIS SOLE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MATCHING SIGNATURE ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION CARD SEPARATELY FILED FROM THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT. TO ENSURE THAT THAT VOTER IS WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE AND THAT THEY ARE ABLE -- TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE AND TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN'T A DOUBLE VOTE. PURPOSE OF A PROVISIONAL BALLOT IS BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING NOT QUITE RIGHT IN THE RECORDS OF THE VOTING PROCESS AND WE AS A COUNTRY DECIDED CORRECTLY SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS NOT A BARRIER TO SOMEONE WHO'S. ENTITLED TO VOTE AND LEGITIMATELY CAN THOUGH CAN DO IT THAT'S WHAT PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ARE FOR DAEGU THROUGH A VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SCRUTINY IN THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE AND RIGHTLY SO WE NEED TO KEEP THESE. TWO OF FORMS AND PROCESSES TOTALLY SEPARATE. AND IN THE FINAL POINT IS THERE'S ERROR. THERE'S AIR ALL THE TIMES IN REGISTRAR'S OFFICE NOT NECESSARILY FRAUD BUT ERROR THAT HAPPENS AND REMOVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE LEVELS OF SCRUTINY ON WHETHER VOTER REGISTRATION IS LEGITIMATE. OR PROVISIONAL VOTE CAST IS LEGITIMATE COMBINING THEM TOGETHER INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ERROR. R. VOTE IS TO SACROSANCT. TO LOOK FOR AN ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE THAT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORSE TO HAVE ACCURATE ELECTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. AND AND KEEP IN MIND MEMBERS WE ARE AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR REGISTRARS WITH TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ARE NOT REGISTERED IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE. AND VOTING PURPOSEFULLY OR ACCIDENTALLY MORE THAN ONCE. COMBINING THE AT THE VOTER REGISTRATION CARD WITH THE PROVISIONAL CARD WILL MAKE THAT WORSE AND TAKE US BACKWARDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS BAKER. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL. SKY XIN OUR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISTER BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I DON'T THINK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THAT VERY ROBUST. A DISCUSSION I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION THAT SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND IS FRANKLY A TOTALLY IN A DIFFERENT POLICY DISCUSS IN. ALL S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE DOES IS TAKE TWO FORMS AND MERGE INTO ONE SINGLE FORM IT'S SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WHO ARE NOT. IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO INCREASE CONFUSION OR INCREASE VOTER FRAUD -- I DON'T THINK THAT SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT -- CREATE UNCERTAINTY IN OUR VOTING PROCESS THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU.

NOW YOU MAY OPEN MISTER TING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TO PRESENT AB. EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE REASON THAT WE ARE PRESENTE EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT TODAY. IT BECAUSE THERE WAS A BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS COLLECTING SIGNATURES AND HAD ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO GET ON THE BALLOT. I JUST WANT TO SET SOME CONTEXT REGARDING WHAT THAT BALLOT MEASURE WOULD HAVE DONE. THE BALLOT MEASURE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ANY INCREASE IN LOCAL TAXES TO BE APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE THAT MEANS ANYONE. TWO IT WOULD REQUIRE THE LAW SPECIFY HOW TAX REVENUE CAN BE SPENT. IN THREE WOULD RECLASSIFY SOME CHARGES CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS FEES AS TAXES. AND INITIATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVE. TO PLAY A TAXES PASSED AFTER JANUARY FIRST FOR EXAMPLE IN MY CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WE PASSED. TO TAXES. LAST JUNE OR THIS JUNE. ONE WAS THE PROPOSITION G. WHERE WE RAISE A HUNDRED AND WILL BE REYES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO BE GIVEN TO TEACHERS FOR SALARIES BECAUSE WE FACE A TEACHING CRISIS NEVER IN OUR PLEASE KEEP YOUR CONVERSATIONS TO A MINIMUM. MISTER TING YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU BUT SPEAKER WE ALSO PASSED PROPOSITION SEE WHICH RAISES A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. 85% OF THAT FOR CHILDCARE AND 15% OF OUR FOR GENERAL. CITY SERVICES. SO WE ARE. PRESENTED WITH THIS QUANDARY ALL OF DOING SOMETHING THAT WILL SAVE THE GREATER GOOD IN SAVE OUR CITIES AND MANY OF THE CRITICAL CITY SERVICES THAT ARE RESIDENTS RELY ON EVERY DAY. TO IN ORDER TO PASS THIS MEASURE. THAT I PRESENT TO YOU NOW. AB IF YOU THIRTY A PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE CHARGING TAXES [inaudible] A GROCER'S. A PROHIBITION EXCLUDES EXISTING LOCAL MEASURES THAT WERE IN PLACE BEFORE THIS YEAR. AND ALSO DOES NOT APPLY TO CIGARETTES ALCOHOL OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE SODA TAXES THAT WERE PASSED. EARLIER IN ALBANY BERKELEY OPEN IN MY JURISDICTION SAN FRANCISCO WILL BE ABLE TO REMAIN. THE BILL WOULD SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST [inaudible] TWENTY THIRTY ONE AGAIN ALL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT [inaudible] WE TRADITIONALLY. HAVE NOT WANTED TO DO. WE AS LEGISLATORS ARE HAVING TO MAKE A VERY VERY TOUGH CHOICES TODAY. AND I AM PRESENTING THIS BILL. IN HOPES THAT THE GREATER GOOD WILL PREVAIL. SO THAT OUR CITIES COULD CONTINUE TO BRING TO THE VOTERS CRITICAL MEASURES TO FUND CITY SERVICES SUCH AS PUBLIC SAFETY EDUCATION CHILDCARE PUBLIC WORKS PARKS LIBRARIES AND THE LIST GOES ON IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS MEASURE FORWARD WE DO HAVE TO TAKE -- WE HAD YOU HAVE TO PASS AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT DID THAT. SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR VOTE ON A. B.. EIGHTEEN THIRTY THEY WERE STAYING MISTER BLOOM YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SO I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY WISHES LE -- LAST WEEK. YOU KNOW THE THE OLDER I GET YOU YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO THINK YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING. AND THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMES ALONG [inaudible] TODAY. WE FACED A HOBSON'S CHOICE AS WERE ABOUT TO VOTE TO PROTECT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM AN INSIDIOUS ATTACK. ON DEMOCRACY AND IN DOING SO. WE'RE GONNA RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY THEIR VERY ABILITY TO ACT ON BEHALF OF THEIR RESIDENTS IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. TODAY'S ONE OF THOSE DAYS WHEN I FIND IT -- THAT I HAVE TO HOLD MY NOSE AND CHOOSE THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS BUT WHAT ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED HERE. IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE. TODAY ANYONE WITH A HAREBRAINED IDEA AND DEEP POCKETS CAN BUY A PLACE ON OUR BALLOT AND SUBVERT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND IF I SOUND LIKE I'M FRUSTRATED ANGERED AND DISGUSTED I AM. FRUSTRATED THAT ONE INDUSTRY IS. CLOSING A PATHWAY TO HELP RESOLVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. I AM ANGERED THAT WERE CASTING A VOTE TO PROHIBIT [inaudible] PROHIBIT. TOOL THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WE PROFESS TO DEFEND HERE. THAT THEY CAN USE TO ADDRESS TYPE BEAT US ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND FASTEST GROWING HEALTH CRISES IN OUR NATION. AS WELL AS THE ISSUE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS FACING THE WORLD. ARE TELLING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IT JUST CAN'T DO IT. AND I'M DISGUSTED THAT ONE INDUSTRY IS WILLING TO PRIORITIZE THEIR PRODUCT AND THEIR PROFITS. OVER NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS BUT THE WORLD'S PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. TODAY'S DEBATE WILL CERTAINLY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR INITIATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS BEING DISTORTED AND MANIPULATED. BY MONEYED CORPORATE INTERESTS. EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE JUST LOOK AT WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM AND HOW IT'S BEEN SPENT. BUT WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE MAIN ISSUE HERE TODAY CALIFORNIAN THE UNITED STATES ARE FACING A GROWING HEALTH CRISIS INVOLVING OBESITY DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE. AND WE KNOW THAT SUGARY DRINKS ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS EPIDEMIC THERE'S LOTS THAT WE CAN BE DISCUSSING ABOUT THIS BUT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWED. TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. DIE BE THIS IS NOW THE SEVENTH LARGEST CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE NATION. AND ONE IN THREE CHILDREN BORN AFTER. TWO THOUSAND MANY OF YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN. THINK ABOUT THIS. AND HALF OF ALL AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC CHILDREN WILL DEVELOP TYPE TWO DIABETES. PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES CONTRARY TO WHAT INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES WILL SAY THE OVERWHELMING VIEW OF HEALTH EXPERTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS THAT THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. TO OBESITY AND DIABETES IS OVER CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR PARTICULARLY IN BEVERAGES SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AMERICANS HAVE DOUBLED THEIR INTAKE OF SUGAR AND SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. EVERYTHING FROM SODAS SWEDEN TEASE SPORTS DRINKS FLUTE FRUIT FLAVORED DRINKS. THEY ACCOUNT FOR A 43% ARE THAT THEY ACCOUNT 4403% OF THAT INCREASE. THE AVERAGE AMERICAN NOW DRINKS MORE THAN FORTY FIVE GALLONS OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES PER YEAR AND OBESITY AND DIABETES ARE COSTING THE STATE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR IN HOSPITALIZATION AND MEDICARE COSTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF ONLY THERE WAS MONEY FOR PREVENTION. IN FACT ONE ESTIMATE HAS IT THAT GOES TO MAINTENANCE OR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC METABOLIC DISEASE SEVENTY FIVE SENT. CALIFORNIANS ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES AND THEIR LIMBS. IN IN TWENTY TEN ALONE ABOUT SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND NON FROM ADDICT LOWER LIMB AMPUTATIONS. SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND WERE PERFORMED IN ADULTS TWENTY YEARS OR OLDER WITH DIAGNOSED DIABETES. DOCTORS ARE REPORTING STROKES IN EIGHT YEAR OLDS HEART ATTACKS AND TEN YEAR OLDS. AND DIO'S FOR KIT FOR KIDNEY FAILURE IN THIRTY YEAR OLDS. STATEWIDE FROM TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS A 31% INCREASE IN THESE AMPUTATIONS. SINCE TWENTY TOWN FOLKS. UNFORTUNATELY IS A STATE WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THIS PROBLEM AND IN OUR ABSENCE CITIES WERE DOING SO. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THE INCUBATOR FOR MANY OF OUR MOST PRESSING ISSUES WE LOOK TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE BOLD CREATIVE AND TO DEVELOP POLICY SOLUTIONS. MANY OF WHICH WE THEN IMPLEMENT STATEWIDE THIRTY SECOND ON THE ISSUE OF DIABETES AND OBESITY THEY'VE DONE JUST THAT. AND IT'S WORKED NOW THE INDUSTRY'S PANICKED OVERBEARING RESPONSE TO THESE LOCAL EFFORTS TELLS US ALL WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THIS CRISIS. AND THE EFFICACY OF THE GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT HAVE RISEN UP TO TAKE IT ON BUT IT DOESN'T STRIP OUR ABILITY TO ACT. NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY IS PLEASE GLEE ON US NOW MORE THAN EVER THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WILL LOOK TO US TO FIX THIS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE PROBLEM AND REVERSED THIS HORRIBLE EPIDEMIC. THAT IS TAKING LIVES AND NEEDLESSLY RIPPING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES PART TIME IS UP MR BLOOM. TODAY ARE RELUCTANTLY VOTE ON THIS BILL FOR THE GREATER GOOD AND ASK FOR YOUR I'VE OF DOCTOR EGGMAN. YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOUR SPEAKER IT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE TO VOICE MY MY FRUSTRATION WITH THIS PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE A LARGE CONTINGENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM STOCKTON WHO -- WERE ORGANIZING TO PUT A SUGAR TAX ON OUR BALLOT AND HAVE COME UP TODAY TO VOICE THEIR FRUSTRATION TO THE COMMITTEE WHO MET BEFORE. SO I WOULD SAY TO THEM I WOULD SAY TO EVERYBODY. THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE THE LONG GAME AND WHILE IT IS A VERY CLEAR EXAMPLE TODAY WE SEE OF WHAT DEEP POCKETS CAN DO TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AND WE SEE TODAY THAT WE ARE TAKING A PAUSE IN THE BATTLE AGAINST OBESITY. BUT IT'S JUST A PAUSE. AND THE FIGHT GOES ON AND THE MORE THAT WE HEAR THE YOUNG PEOPLE RAISE THEIR VOICES. IS TODAY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A VERY TOP HEAVY DOWN A CORPORATE. PUSH DOWN ON DEMOCRACY. BUT FOR EVERY ACTION THERE IS A REACTION. AND SO I ENCOURAGE THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND ACTIVISTS AROUND AS WE CONTINUE THIS FIGHT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND AGAINST TO BE SEATED TO CONTINUE TO RAISE YOUR VOICES AND TO ORGANIZE AND TO LET THIS BE AN EXAMPLE TO YOU. OF ONE BUT WHEN BLOCKADES PRESENT THEMSELVES WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY AROUND. SO THE FIGHT CONTINUES. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE ABILITY. TO RAISE TAXES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS WHAT THE CITY OF STOCKTON HAS JUST COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AND LAST YEAR. THE CITIZENS VOTED A TAX UPON THEMSELVES TO INCREASE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TO INCREASE. PARKS. NOW WE HAVE LIBRARIES OPEN EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK WOULDN'T HAVE THAT LAST YEAR. WE NOW HAVE LIBRARIES OPEN EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK THAT IS A WONDERFUL THING. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO WOULDN'T LOCAL PEOPLE DECIDE TO TAX THEMSELVES THAT IS WHY WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT. AND THAT ABILITY AWAY FROM THEM. SO AGAIN WHILE WE ARE TAKING A PAUSE IN THE BATTLE. WHAT WE DO IS RE GROUP? AND WE GO FORWARD. SO ALSO RELUCTANTLY BE SUPPORTING THISTODAY I ENCOURAGE ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAME FROM STOCKTON AND ALL AROUND TO LET THIS BE AN EXAMPLE. A WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE CORPORATE MONEY LOOKS LIKE [inaudible] AND STRATEGIZE. ABOUT THE REACTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN MISTER COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. CALLING SOMEONE A RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WANNA. OFFER A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TAKE ON WHY I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT VOTE TO CAST -- YESTERDAY I THINK OUR NATION TOOK A COLLECTIVE [inaudible] BREATH. AS ANTHONY KENNEDY. ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE RETIRING AT THE END OF THIS TERM. US SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY. AND IT BROUGHT TO MIND THAT ACTOR [inaudible] REMARKABLY. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THIS MONTH. I RECEIVED A NOTE. FROM THE PRIVATE CHAMBERS OF U. S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DANTE KINNITTY. CAME TO MY HOME KENNETH WILLIAM COOLEY COOPER RIVER COURT. RANCHO CORDOVA. AND I OPEN THAT NOTE AND IT WAS A LETTER OF COMMENDATION CONGRATULATIONS TO ME. AND MY FUTURE COLLEAGUES. AS WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH ON JULY FIRST. THE BRAND NEW CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH WAS THE HOME. OF TONY KENNEDY. AND THE WORST CEASE EXTENDED TO ME IN THAT LETTER. WE'RE VERY RELEVANT TO A NEW CITY BUT I THINK THERE ARE ALSO RELEVANT TO WHY. A VOTE LIKE THIS COMES ALONG. WHY ALREADY ON THIS FLOOR WE'VE HEARD? A RELUCTANCE TO CAST THIS VOTE. A VOTE LIKE THIS IS SEEN AS A HOBSON'S CHOICE. CONCERNS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND US THAT IMPERIL DEMOCRACY. AND THAT THERE IS A NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE ENGAGED IN OUR DEMOCRACY AND FIGHTING ON IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND NOT TO LOSE HOPE WHEN. ISSUES LIKE THIS ARISE. AND THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY TONY KENNEDY TO ME. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS NOT YET ELECTED OFFICIALS. PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. AND ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. FOR WORKING TO REINVIGORATE THE PRINCIPLE. A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. HE WENT ON TO SAY SELF GOVERNMENT MUST NOT BE AN ABSTRACT IDEAL. WHAT BUT MUST BE A REALITY? AND HE SAID WE MUST BE UNCEASING AND OUR EFFORTS. TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND RESPECTED BY OUR PEOPLE. I ACTUALLY VIEW THIS VOTE. AS IT RELATES TO A SPECIFIC AREA SOFT DRINKS OBESITY THESE UNDERLYING ISSUES. BUT WE SEE PEOPLE TAKING THE INVESTOR PROCESS IN A WAY THE HIRAM JOHNSON NEVER SOUGHT. MANIPULATE AND USE IT TO FORCE ISSUES. BELIEVING THAT BIG MONEY SPENT ON BALLOTS CAN CAN RESHAPE. OUTCOMES OF ISSUES OF GREAT CONSEQUENCE. AND THIS BECOMES A MOMENT WHEN WE ON THIS FLOOR. GRAPPLE WITH OUR PLACE TO SORT OF BE THE CARE [inaudible] CARE. CARETAKERS AND STEWARDS OF DEMOCRACY TRYING TO MAKE SURE OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. PORT PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY AT EVERY LEVEL -- ARE IN FACT REAL A REALITY NOT. RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER -- BY MONEYED INTERESTS. AND SO I I RISE -- ON THE COUNCIL OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TONY KENNEDY EXPRESSED REPRODUCTIVE YEARS AGO. THAT THERE IS A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND. FOR DEMOCRACY AND A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND AIR TONIGHT VOTE. DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THE I RISE TODAY TO AND I'M GONNA CAST A VOTE TODAY THAT I NEVER EVER EXPECTED I'D HAVE TO CAST. YEAH I CAME HERE TO CONDUCT MENDOZA HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO HELP IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE LIKE THIS. ATTACK THE ABILITY OF OUR CITIES TO TO RAISE MONEY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC SAFETY. AS A TRADE OFF. TO AN INDUSTRY. THEY WANT TO PERPETUATE OBESITY [inaudible] DENTAL DECAY [inaudible] DIABETES. THIS IS OUR THEIR WORDS I HAVE SEEN IN THE PRESS TO DESCRIBE THIS [inaudible] STORES XIN. DISTORTION IS DEFINED AS THE PRACTICE OF ATTAINING SOMETHING. THROUGH FORCE OR THREATS. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEK. AND THE BAD ACTORS ARE THE SODA INDUSTRY. AND THE WAY THEY'RE DOING THIS IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS. WHEN I WAS IN THE CITY COUNCIL THE CITY OF HEALDSBURG? AS THE MAYOR WE WERE THE FIRST CITY IN THE STATE TO TRY TO RAISE THE SMOKING AGE. TO TWENTY ONE TECH TO HELP PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE. WE FOUND OUT. THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE STATE LAW PREEMPTED US FROM DOING THAT. NOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN RAISING MONEY. AND FIGHTING FIRST FOR SO TAXES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN IT STARTED TO WORK. AND GUESS WHAT. ASSUMPTION IS GOING DOWN. AND IT'S TERRIFIED THE INDUSTRY. SO WHAT THIS MEASURE DIES. IS IT BRINGS FULL CIRCLE IT BRAINS THAT ISSUE BACK TO THIS BODY TAKES IT OUT OF THE HANDS THE LOCALS. WE'RE CREATING THE NEW TOBACCO HERE TODAY. IT'S CALLED THE SODA INDUSTRY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAVE TO GO TO HEAR SO NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE OUTRAGEOUS PROFITS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY. BUT THERE GONNA BE OTHER CONCENTRATE ALL THEIR RESOURCES ON THIS BODY AND THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PREVENT US. FROM DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. PEOPLE COME TO US ALL THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE [inaudible] AND YET. WE'RE PERPETUATING THAT. WE CAN'T GET THE MONEY WE NEED. THROUGH ART PROCESS. TO GIVE EDUCATION ENOUGH EDUCATION ON DIABETES PREVENTION. BUT YET WE SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON TREATMENT. FOR DIABETES AND OBESITY AND HEART DISEASE. THE HYPOCRISY OF THIS ABSOLUTELY APPALLING. THEY MAY WIN THE BATTLE TODAY BUT THEY WILL NOT WIN THE WAR. CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR YOU WILL GALVANIZE PEOPLE LIKE THOSE TWENTY FIVE STUDENTS FROM STOCKTON TO CAME IN HERE TODAY TO SPEAK THEIR MIND. WE WILL WIN THE WAR AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THERE. AND THEN PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THE COST TO THE STATE I CHALLENGE THE SODA INDUSTRY WHO HAS COMPILED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THIS CAMPAIGN INITIATIVE COUNT. GIVE IT BACK A COMMUNITIES. REPUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. DON'T IT'S TO GET BACK IN YOUR POCKETS AND DON'T GIVE IT BACK TO YOUR SHAREHOLDERS GIVE IT BACK TO COMMUNITIES. IS YOU'RE GONNA USE THAT MONEY TO TRY TO DISENFRANCHISE PEOPLE. ALTHOUGH FOR THIS TODAY VERY VERY REGRETFULLY THIS IS A REALLY SAD DAY FOR ME PERSONALLY. BUT I WILL NOT QUIT FIGHTING. THEY THAT WOULD. MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH WHAT MANY MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID I THINK THIS PROCESS STAKES. I THINK THIS PROCESS TAKES THE POWER OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK IT KEEPS US FROM BEING ABLE TO DO OUR JOB THE JOB THAT. WE WERE ELECTED TO DO. TO VET BILL IDEA IS TO TAKE THEM TO THE COMMITTEE PROCESS TO HAVE PUBLIC INPUT. AND TO ALL ULTIMATELY HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS HAVE GOOD PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S ESTABLISH. FOR THIS STATE. WHAT I AM KIND OF BEWILDERED BY IS? THIS KIND OF THAT WEEK THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WE CAN NOT VOTE FOR THIS. BILL. WE CANNOT GO ALONG WITH THIS DEAL. AND FIRST JUST A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED FOLKS WE ALL KNOW THAT. WE WERE ALL MANY OF US WERE HERE LAST YEAR LAST TERM. WHEN SEIU ESTABLISH THE PRECEDENT OF DOING THIS? BY GETTING OF A MEASURE QUALIFIED ON THE BALLOT AND THEN STRIKING A DEAL. AND BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE RESULT YOU WANT ALONG WITH IT. ANY ALLOWED. TO GO FOR THE FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. YOU ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT NOW OTHER SPECIAL INTERESTS JUST LIKE THEM. ARE DOING THE SAME THING. IF YOU WANNA STOP THAT PRECEDENT. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. WE'RE ALL SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A VOTE. WE COULD DECIDE TO VOTE NO OR YOU CAN DECIDE NOT TO VOTE AT ALL. IT SAY AND THAT WILL DEMAND THAT PEOPLE GO. BACK TO THE PROCESS THAT WE ALL. THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS I THINK ONE US TO TO ABIDE BY AND THAT WE ALL WANT TO DO WE WANT TO HAVE GOOD POLICY ONE HAVE A DEBATE IT WE WILL. DISCUSS WE WANT TO HAVE IT VETTED. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WE HAVE THE THREAT OF AN INITIATIVE IN THE LAST. COUPLE DAYS WE CRAFT TOGETHER SOME LANGUAGE AND SAY OKAY GUYS LET'S VOTE ON YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR SAYS YOU HAVE TO OUR BECAUSE YOU PARTY SAYS YOU HAVE TO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. WE TALK A LOT THIS LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. WELL HERE'S YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. IT'S NOT A HOBSON'S CHOICE BY THE WAY EITHER IT'S NOT A HOBSON'S CHOICE AT ALL. ON THE ONE HAND YOU LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE. BY INITIATIVE THEY GET TO VOTE. TO THEY CAN DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT THEIR TAX THRESHOLD TO BE. THEY CAN ALSO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF TAXES THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE LOCALLY. ON THAT SIDE IS OF IS GIVING VOTERS A VOICE GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON THESE ISSUES. ON THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING ALONG WITH THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. NO MATER WHAT SIDE THEY ARE NO MATTER WHICH ONE SIP SUPPORT. ONE OR THE OTHER WE CAN SAY NO TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS I KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU USE THE INITIATIVE TO SUBVERT OUR PROCESS.

PLEASE JOIN ME TODAY AND AND STOP IN THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT. MANY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED IS OF THE NATIONAL PROCESS AND I THINK THAT ALL OF US ARE GONNA. COMMIT -- I'M CONFIDENT THE MOST BLESSED NOT ALL OF US WILL COMMIT TO FIXING THOSE BROKEN SYSTEM THAT PUTS US IN THIS POSITION. OF WE KNOW THE CAN THE CONSUMPTION A SODA AND OTHER SHOULD WE DRINKS DROPPED 21% AND LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN BERKELEY. A YEAR AFTER ITS PENNY BROWN'S TAX TOOK A FACT. NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT. THESE TAXES WORK. THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCING THE RESULTS I DESIRED [inaudible] AND JUST. AS WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE RESULTS. BIG SODAS GETTING SCARED. AND NOW JOINING THE RANKS OF BIG TOBACCO WE HAVE BIG SODA. TRYING TO INFLUENCE THE ABILITY. FOR COMMUNITIES TOXIC CARE FOR THEMSELVES. COCA COLA TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HAD NET REVENUES OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. PEPSICO. HAD NET REVENUES OF SIXTY THREE BILLION [inaudible] DOLLARS. AT THE HEART WHAT THEY DO ACCORDING TO PEPSICO'S PERFORMANCE WITH PURPOSE EMPOWERING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. WELL I GUESS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS INITIAL PROPERTY BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE YOU GO. TO THEIR WEBSITE LOOK UNDER BALLOT INITIATIVES SPACE MENTION A COUPLE OF DON'T IMAGINE THIS ONE THEY KNOW. WHAT IT IS THEY'RE DOING? THE NEAR TIMES HAD A HEADLINE. ON THIS FIASCO SAYING A NEW INDUSTRY STRATEGY IS STUNNING SOME LAWMAKERS. FRANKLY DOESN'T STUNNED ME BUT IT DOES MAKE ME STICK SICK TO MY STOMACH. IT DOESN'T STUN ME BECAUSE MONEY HAS INFECTED OUR DEMOCRACY TO THE BREAKING POINT. SO IMPACTED THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS IMPACT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS ISN'T IT IS IMPACTED EVERYBODY A GOVERNMENT IN THIS NATION. EVEN HERE WERE WEALTHY INDUSTRIES DICTATE FAR TOO OFTEN INCREMENTAL INCREMENTAL CHANGE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OR IF WE'RE ABLE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AT ALL [inaudible] NOW. I KNOW THE DETAILS THE BILLS SAY WE THIRTEEN YEARS YOU KNOW LITTLE SUNSET ON I TELL EVERYONE HERE AND CERTAINLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE UP THERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THIRTEEN YEARS. TO MAKE CHANGE IN TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE BIG SODA. DECLARED WAR ON THIS BODY BIG SORT A DECLARED WAR. ON ALL LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES.

WE REALLY NEED YOU AND SO -- I'M GRATEFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE SPOKEN UP. ARE CRITICIZING THE SHAKEDOWN. AND I REALLY REALLY KNOW THAT WE CAN DO BETTER AS A BODY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO STAND UP NOT DECIDE THIS INDUSTRY BUT TO MANY INDUSTRIES. THAT PUSH US AROUND AND TRY TO DICTATE WHAT WE DO IN THIS BODY. MR MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS LEGISLATION I OF A GOT I AGREE IT'S IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING. IT IT'S TROUBLING TO ME AS WAS SOMEBODY THAT SERVED OUR COUNTRY TO ENSURE ALL THESE RIGHTS. IT BOTHERS ME AS AS A FATHER. THE KNOW THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. THE THE IDEA OF PUTTING A BALLOT INITIATIVE OUT THERE. GIVEN IT TO THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ELECT US TO BE HERE. IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ELECT. OUR CITY GOVERNMENTS THAT. SOME ARE GREEN YOU KNOW WE NEED TO PROTECT. IN IN YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE NEED TO PROTECT LOCAL CONTROL WE NEED TO PROTECT THESE THINGS. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES OUR CHILDREN. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO STOP. PLAIN OF THE BLAME GAME. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE A DIABETES PROBLEM. WE ALSO HAVE A HUGE PAIR TEAM PROBLEM IN THE STATE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON IT SICKENS ME. AS A PARENT. THAT ANY OF US ARE GONNA BLAME BIG SOLEDAD. ON OUR KIDS GETTING DIABETES. STEP UP AND BE A PARENT. YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KIDS HEALTHY HABITS. WE USED TO TEACH HOME EC. WE USED TO TEACH PARENTS HOW THE PARENTS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IS THE WORLD AS WE ALL LOVE TO BRAG AND ARE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EXTRA TAXES THOUGH WE'VE BROUGHT IN THIS YEAR. THAT WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT A BETTER PROCESS. SO INSTEAD WE'RE GONNA BLAME BIG INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING BLAME. THIS WE'RE GONNA PLAY GAMES WITH AN INITIATIVE PROCESS WE DO THE SAME THING AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM YUBA. SAID S. YA YOU FIFTEEN DOLLARS MINIMUM WAGE WE WE'VE SEEN THIS MEMBERS. STOP GETTING PLAYED. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE NONSENSE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IS LEGISLATURE'S IN THE STATE THAT HAS A 24% POVERTY RATES. TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR PARENTS THE SAD PART IS IS WE ARE PARENTS WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR KIDS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY HOME AND PARENT THEIR CHILDREN THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO SPEND THAT QUALITY TIME WITH THEIR KIDS. BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY PAYING ALL THESE DAMN TAXES. SO WHY ARE YOU [inaudible] COLLEAGUES [inaudible] MEMBERS. FELLOW PARENTS FELLOW LEGISLATORS. QUIT PLAYING THE GAME. WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TELL THE SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO LOWER THE COST OF LIVING. GET OUR FAMILIES OUT OF THIS 24% POVERTY AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT QUALITY TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE NO ON THIS NONSENSE TODAY. IN TURN AROUND AND MAKE A BETTER CALIFORNIA EYES FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR MATHIS. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I THINK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR STANDING UP IN SHARING. THEIR PERSPECTIVES IN THEIR OPINIONS AND THEIR FRUSTRATIONS -- WITH WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY AND AND THE POSITION THAT WE'RE ALL IN YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE STARTED MY CAMPAIGN WAS TWENTY FIVE WHEN I GOT ELECTED AT TWENTY SEVEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED I THINK WE ALL. GET ELECTED WITH THIS THE SAME IDEA WE JUST WANT TO COME UP HERE TO DO SOME GOOD. TO COME UP HERE TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REPRESENTING OUR CONSTITUENTS THE WAY THAT THEY DESERVE TO BE REPRESENTED. A PART OF DOING THAT JOB IS MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS. AND WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH TODAY IS A DIFFICULT DECISION AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT BUT IT'S THE POSITION THAT WE'RE IN BECAUSE OF THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE. AND IT'S TRUE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANYBODY IN THIS STATE WHETHER THEY'RE HERE OR THERE OUT OF STATE AS LONG AS THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY THEY CAN HIRE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TO COLLECT A BUNCH OF SIGNATURES AND PUT SOMETHING ON OUR BALLOT. THAT FORCES ARE HAND AT TIMES OR PUTS US IN A POSITION. WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE TYPES OF CHOICES OR THEY MISINFORM THE VOTERS TO MAKE A DECISION THAT ULTIMATELY IS POOR FOR THEM. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE TRYING TO PUT THEM IN A POSITION SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE? BY THE CAN. TO SERVE THE CONSTITUENTS THAT ELECTED THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM HERE. IS THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE TODAY. IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF MY MEMBERS THAT ARE UPSET WITH THE POSITION THAT WHAT THE WHAT THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE THAT SHOULD BE READY TO COMMIT TO REFORMING. THAT INITIATIVE PROCESS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO COMMIT TO DO. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS TO US AND AS LEGISLATORS IN THIS BODY. IT'S EVERY TIME SOMETHING GETS PASS ON THAT BALLOT. IT HAMSTRINGS US IN A PUTS US INTO AN AWKWARD AND UNFORTUNATE POSITION IMAGINE YOUR BUILDER YOU WANT TO BUILD A HOUSE. AND WHEN I SAY I WANT MY HOUSE BUILT IN TWO WEEKS THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO LOOK LIKE AND I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING. AND SO YOU HAD THOSE TWO WEEKS BEFORE I LEAVE I TAKE YOUR TOOLS ANTI ONE OF YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK. STILL HAVE THE SAME TIMELINE NOW YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR TOOLS THE ONLY HAVE ONE HAND TO DO IT THAT'S THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WE ARE BEING. HAMSTRING FROM BEING ABLE TO DO OUR JOB BY THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS AND IT SHOULD BE A LESSON TO EVERYBODY THAT GETS APPROACHED BY SOMEONE TO SIGN AN INITIATIVE. PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE CITING. READ WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING DON'T TAKE WHAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD AT FACE VALUE BECAUSE A LOTTA TIMES IF NOT TRUE. IT IS NOT A LIE OR TO DISK DISTORTION. OF WHAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE FACE HERE TODAY. IS A DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE ON AN ISSUE THAT IS POLLING. AND IT RAINS THAT COULD PASS BECAUSE THERE IS NO OPPOSITION THAT HAS ENOUGH RESOURCES TO FIGHT IT BACK SO WE LET THIS GO YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT WE COULD SAY NO WHAT IS THAT ME WE GET STUCK WITH THIS INITIATIVE PASSING ON THE BALLOT. AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OUR HAMSTRING FURTHER. MUCH FURTHER THAN THEY WOULD BE HAMSTRING IT BY PASSING NESS BUT THIS ALSO NOW PUTS THE ONUS ON US. IT'S TIME FOR US TO STAND UP. IT'S TIME FOR US TO MAKE THIS DECISION THIS INDUSTRY WANTED US TO MAKE THIS CHOICE THIS INDUSTRY WANTED TO FALL ON US TO BE THE ONES TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. WE HAVE A SODA TAX IN THIS INDUSTRY WHY THINK IT'S NOW TIME TO CALL THEM ON IT AND WE BETTER COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND HOLD ON THAT COMMITMENT. TO MAKE THAT CHANGE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PUT IT ON US WE'RE GONNA STEP UP WE'RE GONNA DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CAME UP HERE TO DO IS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND NOW IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS THANK GOD I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BILL. MISTER HARPER YOUR RECOMMEND. YEAH I THINK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER IN CHAIR. I FOR ONE WANT TO STAND UP. INSTEAD I AM TIRED. OF THE BASHING OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS HERE IN THIS CHAMBER. THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS WAS INTENDED. BYPASS A CORRUPTED STATE LEGISLATURE. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY VOTE ON ISSUES [inaudible] WITH OUT. HAVING THIS BODY INTERFERING WITH IT. AND I WANT TO AVOID SITUATIONS IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WOULD WANT TO QUOTE REFORM IT WHICH REALLY MEANS TO HAMSTRING THE BALLOT ISSUE PROCESS WE ALREADY HAVE IT SET THE BALLOT INITIATIVES BUT FOR BY THE CITIZENS. ARE PUSH IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT RATHER THAN THE PRIMARY ELECTION BALLOT IN A WHOLE SERIES OF OTHER LAWS BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO HAMSTRING IT. AND TO TRY TO OBSTRUCT IT. WHICH I BELIEVE IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG WE NEED TO BE PROTECTORS OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE PROTECTORS OF THE VOTERS. NOT OBSTRUCT ERRORS OF THE VOTERS. NOW I HEARD THE MEMBER FROM SAN JOSE TALK ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS BEING A SHAKEDOWN IF YOU WILL NOT FIND IT COMICAL. THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID BEING OVERTAXED IS CONSIDERED A SHAKEDOWN BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT THAT'S JUST THE GENERAL NATURE OF THIS POPULATION THAT SEATED AND IF IN THIS BODY. BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S A SHAKEDOWN IF YOU BELIEVE IT'S A CORRUPTION YOU DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. NOW I FOR ONE AND MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. I RECOGNIZE THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE DEAL CAN EASILY BE UNDONE BY MANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE. WITH THE FORTY ONE VOTE OF FORTY ONE VOTE -- MARGIN ODD NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER OR THE YEAR AFTER YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A THIRTEEN OR TWELVE YEAR PROCESS TO JUST GOING ON DO IT. BUT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE ON THE OTHER HAND. THAT CAN ONLY BE UNDONE BY THE VOTERS THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S GREAT VALUE IN THIS. IF YOU FEEL THIS IS A SHAKEDOWN. IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE A HOBSON'S CHOICE. DON'T CRY YOUR CROCODILE PEERS AT ME. YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE NO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE DO SO. IN FRONT OF ALL THE FOLKS THAT WERE IN FRONT OF IN THE GALLERY TODAY ONE OF FULLER DAYS THAT I'VE SEEN HERE. DON'T VOTER CORRUPTED VOTE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE YOUR FEELINGS YOUR CONSCIENCE YOUR PHILOSOPHY DON'T BE CORRUPTED VOTE HOW YOU FEEL [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK. THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS WAS MEANT FOR CITIZENS TO BYPASS THE LEGISLATURE NOT BILLIONAIRES AND MAJOR CORPORATIONS THAT WAS CLEARLY THE INTENT. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THIS BILL. WELL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUT ON SODA TAXES ARE QUITE WELL MOTIVATED THE FACT IS THERE'S MORE SUGAR PER OUNCE. IN A WELCH'S GRAPE JUICE AND ONE OF MY SEAT MINIMIZE NEARBY SEAT MEMBERS JUST TO HAVE ME LOOK AT THIS. THERE'S MORE SUGAR PER OUNCE IN THE WELCH'S GRAPE JUICE THAN THERE IS IN THE SODA. THERE'S ALMOST AS MUCH SUGAR PER OUNCE IN THE ORANGE JUICE AS THERE IS IN THE SODA. SO JUST PARA HAVING A TAX ON SODA. IT DRIVES IT PEOPLE THE ARTIST USES DOING NOTHING [inaudible] FURTHER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. IN THE FIFTIES WHEN OP MY MOM GODDESS SUGARY SODA EVERY WEEK WE ALL DRANK IT. WE DIDN'T BECOME OBESE WE DID NOT -- GET DIABETES TYPE TWO DIABETES HOWEVER. AS THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WERE DEVELOPED. WE NOW SEE. PEOPLE GETTING DIABETES PEOPLE BEING OBESE. THERE ARE GOOD SCIENTIFIC REASONS FOR THIS. WHEN YOU TAKE CARE AND AND ARTIFICIALLY DRAPED ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED DRANK? YOUR BODY SAYS OH I TASTED MY MOUTH I TASTED MY STOMACH. LET'S GIVE ASSUME INSULIN. THAT INSULIN ISN'T NEEDED IT CAN LEAD TO INSULIN RESISTANCE. IT CAN ALSO LEAD. TO OBESITY BECAUSE NOW. YOUR BLOOD SUGARS DOWN SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR BLOOD SUGARS DOWN YOU'RE HUNGRY AND YOU EAT. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TAX IT SHOULD BE ON ALL THESE THINGS SUGARY DRINKS [inaudible] ARM. ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED DRINKS AND FRUIT JUICE THEY ARE ALL DANGEROUS THEY'RE ALL CAUSING US PROBLEMS SAU I THINK THIS IS A GOOD VOTE RIGHT NOW. I AGREE I I KNOW THAT NOT ALL IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY ARE GOING TO AGREE WITH ME ON THIS BUT THERE'S GOOD SCIENCE BEHIND IT. AND FURTHER. THE USE OF ARTIFICIALLY SWEETENED OF OF SUGAR IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN [inaudible] A DIABETES. AND OBESITY ARE STILL GOING UP. WE KNOW FROM STUDIES THE GOING ON TO ARTIFICIALLY. SWEETEN DRINKS DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TO LOSE WEIGHT. SO I WOULD URGE A YES VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK MISTER ALLEN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SO I'VE HEARD A LOT OF RELUCTANCE -- ON THIS FOR EVERY A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY THEY'RE FACED WITH THIS TERRIBLE CHOICE AND THEY CAME UP-HERE TO VOTE FOR MORE TAXES. AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE STUCK WITH VOTING TO STOP TAXES WILL LOOK GUYS I WOULD SAY HAVE SOME BACKBONE VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH JUST SAID. IF YOU'RE SO OPPOSED TO NOT RAISING TAXES WHAT AGAINST THIS AND AND FEEL FREE TO RAISE TAXES AS YOU TYPICALLY DO IN THIS CHAMBER. NOW LET LET'S ALSO TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS HELP IS WHAT HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE SO CALLED DEAL BUT I THINK A LOT OF YOU MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE DEAL IS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS DEAL IS THERE IS AN INITIATIVE WHOSE SIGNATURES ARE LIKELY GOING TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT WHICH REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. OF THE CITY COUNCILS AND OTHER IN THOSE CITIES TO RAISE TAXES ACROSS THE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WITH THIS INITIATIVE WOULD DO MANY OF THE TAXES CAN BE RAISED RIGHT NOW WITH MAJORITY ONLY VOTES. NOW AS WE KNOW TAXES CONTINUE TO GO UP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS ISSUE IT WOULD BE A GREAT THING IT DOESN'T SAY YOU CAN'T RAISE TAXES. IT WOULD YOU SAY THE UNION OVERWHELMING REASON TO RAISE TAXES IN ORDER TO GET IT PASSED YOUR LOCAL CITIES. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING WE SHOULD ALL THINK IS A GREAT THING BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALL ENCOURAGE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE AS MUCH SAY IS POSSIBLE. IN THIS DEAL WAS PUT TOGETHER APPARENTLY BY THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE. AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO CUT A DEAL. YOU TAKE THIS OFF THE BALLOT WHICH WOULD DENY THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO STOP TAX INCREASES IN THEIR LOCAL CITIES. IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS DEAL IN FRONT OF US THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US WHICH WOULD STOP TAX INCREASES ON GROCERY ITEMS FOR THE NEXT THIRTEEN YEARS. NO THIS IS A TERRIBLE DEAL IS A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL. BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS ANYTHING THIS LEGISLATURE GIVES IN THIS DEAL CAN BE TAKEN AWAY IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR WITH THE MAJORITY VOTE BILL. IT'S STUPID THERE'S NO REASON TO MAKE A DEAL LIKE THIS. WHY DON'T WE ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET THE RIGHT TO DECIDE AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS IS DIRECT DEMOCRACY IF YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF A DEMOCRAT? WHAT COULD BE MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN A DIRECT DEMOCRACY POLICY PUT IN PLACE BY HIRAM WALKER IN NINETEEN OH SIX GIVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE ABILITY TO DIRECTLY DECIDE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM? NOW AS FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS OUT THERE AS FOR THE S. C. AYE YOU IS ON ONE SIDE OF THIS DEAL AND THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE WOODS APPARENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DEAL. A VERY SIMPLE IN A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THIS IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT GIVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST. FOR THEM THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY A GREAT BILL I THINK WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY STOP TAX INCREASE ON GROCERY ITEMS THE NEXT THIRTEEN YEARS. THE BALLOT ISSUE IT IS A GREAT BALLOT INITIATIVE WE SHOULD GIVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT COUNTY. THIRDS SUPERMAJORITY TO PASS ANY NEW TAXES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'RE BOTH GREAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD VOTE YES ON THIS WE SHOULD LET THIS INITIATIVE GO FORWARD. BUT IF WE ARE FORCED INTO SOME SORT OF DEAL THERE'S OUT OF OUR HANDS BECAUSE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS ARE TRYING TO WORK AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD TELL EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRAT THIS CHAMBER TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE AND VOTE AGAINST THIS BECAUSE YOU WE ALL KNOW YOU LOVE TAX INCREASES SO WHY WOULD YOU VOTE STARTED TODAY. AND I WOULD SEND A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE THE CALIFORNIA BIZ ROUNDTABLE IN ANY OF THE INTERESTS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS INITIATIVE DON'T STOP TODAY ALLOWS GO FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. GIVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT TO DECIDE AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM WHITTIER APPARENTLY THERE'S NO MONEY IN THE OPPOSITION SIDE TO IT CAN BE A SLAM DUNK IN NOVEMBER. LET'S GIVE THE PEOPLE THE RIGHT CALIFORNIA LET'S PUT THE PEOPLE BACK IN CHARGE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND YES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN LET'S TAKE BACK CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER ALAN. HIRAM JOHNSON THANKS YOU FOR THE REFERENCE. SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE [inaudible] MR TANG. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER JUST THOUGHT THANK WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THERE ARE VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION ULTIMATELY A VOTE FOR THIS LEGISLATION TODAY. IS A VOTE TO ALLOW OUR CITIES TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ASK THEIR VOTERS. TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE. A PAVE ROADS TO FIX SCHOOLS. TO REPAIR PARKS. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE VERY CRITICAL SERVICES THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING ARE VOTERS TO DO IN EACH OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS VERY CRITICAL. CRITICAL SERVICES WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING VOTE TODAY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST ONE DAY IN THAT THE FIGHT WILL CONTINUE ON THIS ISSUE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. NOT DONE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE ON AB. EIGHTEEN THIRTY THANK YOU FOR STAYING WITH THAT [inaudible] CLARK LIBERAL. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. DESIRE TO VOTE [inaudible] CLERK WILL [inaudible] CLOSER ROLE. TELL YOU THAT I SIXTY KNOWS. ONE SENATE AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN WITHOUT OBJECTION IMMEDIATE TRANSMITTAL TO THE SENATE. PARDON ME IMMEDIATE TRANSMITTAL TO THE GOVERNOR AND MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I REQUEST UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO SUSPEND ASSEMBLY ROLES SIXTY THREE AND SEVENTY SEVEN TO ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO TO TAKE UP AB. THREE SEVEN FIVE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO FILE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONCURRENCE AND SENATE AMENDMENTS. THEY WAS CALDERON MISS WALDRON WE OPPOSE THAT MOTION MISS WALDRON WITH HOLDS MEMBERS IS GONNA BE PROCEDURAL VOTE MISTER CALDERON. MOVES AND MISTER BONTA SECONDS.

THIS IS A PROCEDURAL VOTE IS PROCEDURAL. CALDERON TESTING FOR NOW I MISS WALDRON. TAKES FORTY ONE ON THE ROLL SUSPENSION THE CLERK WELL. CLOSER ROLL EYES FIFTY TWO KNOWS TWENTY ONE THE RULES ARE SUSPENDED MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING UP A. B.. THREE SEVEN CLERK WILL READ. SO ME BILL THREE SEVENTY FIVE BY SOME REMEMBER CHAO AN ACCOLADE OF PRIVACY [inaudible] MR SHALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. AS A SIMPLE BILL. IT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HALF THE RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR OWN PERSONAL DATA AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR EXERCISING THAT RIGHT. IF THE BUSINESS WANTS TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU WHILE YOU'RE SURFING THE WEB. AND THEN USE IT FOR REASONS OF THEIR OWN. LIKE PROVIDING A SERVICE WAS SELLING IT. THEY SHOULD ASK YOUR PERMISSION FIRST. IT IS YOUR DATA. YOUR PRIVACY YOUR CHOICE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE ONLINE BUSINESSES HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT A PERSON'S ONLINE ACTIVITIES. THE WEBSITES YOU VISIT CAN REVEAL WHAT WHEN AND HOW LONG YOU'VE IS A PARTICULAR SITE. AND THE TYPE OF CONTENT THAT YOU DOWNLOAD. THIS CAN REVEAL HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU INCLUDING PERSONAL ACTIVITIES POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS INTERESTS. HEALTH OR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS YOUR GEO LOCATION WHERE YOU GO WHAT YOU DO. ALL DAY EVERY DAY. THAT SHOULD BIGGEST ALL NERVOUS. THE PREVALENCE OF DATA BREACHES LIKE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED ON US HAVE AGAIN. PUT TH SPOTLIGHT ON PRIVACY. CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ALONE IN THEIR DESIRE TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR INFORMATION. IN FACT A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND THAT 4% OF THE PEOPLE SURVEYED. SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN INFORMATION. THE SAME STUDY FOUND THAT 64% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO MORE TO REGULATE WHAT ADVERTISES DO. WITH THEIR INFORMATION. THIS BILL AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE GIVES CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS GREATER RIGHTS TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND PROVIDES REASONABLE CERTAINTY THAT. THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT AGAINST ITS MISUSE. S. CERVICAL A AGAINST CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT BUSINESS THIS CLOSE THE FOLLOWING. THE TYPE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IT COLLECTS WAS CELLS ABOUT THE CONSUMER. THE BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING WHAT'S SELLING THE INFORMATION. AND THE CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION IS SHARED SOLD OR DISCLOSED. IT ALSO GIVES CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THAT A BUSINESS DELETE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT THEM AND REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DO THE SAME. AB THREE SEVEN FIVE ALSO ALIGNS ITSELF WITH A PROPOSED BALLOT INITIATIVE BY. GIVING CONSUMERS THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WHILE REQUIRING AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT TO SELL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF SIXTEEN IT ALSO ENSURES EQUAL RIGHT TO SERVICE. MEANING THAT COMPANIES CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PROVIDING SERVICES TO PEOPLE IF THEY DON'T WANT THEIR DATA SOLD. SO WHY DO WE TAKE ON SUCH A BIG UNDERTAKING. THE TRUTH IS OUT A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. UNLIKE THE INITIATIVE PROCESS PROVISOS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE. BETWEEN PROTECTING PRIVACY RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY TO INNOVATE AND PROVIDE RELIABLE SERVICES NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THE AGREEMENT REACHED WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION IS INDEED A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN PROVIDING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. WITH MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR DATA. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE HOW THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND USED. AND CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM FEEL THE SAME WAY. YOU KNOW I SHOULD HAVE THE ULTIMATE SAY OVER HALL OUR INFORMATION IS USED NOT THE COMPANIES IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE. WOULD THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY WAS CHAO MATURE OBERNOLTE RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE I THINK THE ISSUE OF DIGITAL PRIVACY IS A TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT ONE AND IT WILL BECOME. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN THE DECADES TO COME WHEN THE VARIETY OF INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED ABOUT US ON THE USES TO WHICH THAT INFORMATION IS PUT EXPANDS. I ALSO THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THE CALIFORNIA'S TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS ISSUE. AS THE CRUCIBLE OF COMPANIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN THE COLLECTION OF DIGITAL DATA LIKE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE AND APPLE. I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD. THE EXAMINATION OF THIS ISSUE. I ALSO FEEL THAT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THIS DEBATE. I THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF BALANCING THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN PROTECTING DIGITAL PRIVACY ON THE ONE HAND AND ENCOURAGING COMMERCE ON THE OTHER. THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THEN THROUGH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF HOW MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON THIS ISSUE. LOOK AT THE INITIATIVE THAT THIS ISSUE THAT THIS BILL MS METRO REPLACE THE INITIATIVES ABOUT TWO PAGES LONG THIS BILL IS ALMOST TWENTY PAGES LONG. SO WE HAVE MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS NO ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE STAKEHOLDERSFOR WORKING SO HARD ON THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. NOW HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT. IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING FOR ME. THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN FOLLOWED HERE BECAUSE IT IS BEEN AN ABBREVIATED PROCESS ABBREVIATED BY THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES REQUIRED. TO WITHDRAW THAT INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER. I STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE BILL. BEING USED FOR PURPOSES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE DATA PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL SO I THINK THAT LANGUAGE THESE TO BE TAKEN UP. AND ALSO IN THE PRIVACY HEARING YESTERDAY ON THE BILL. THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS OF POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL SO IT'S CLEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEEDS TO DO SOME WORK. ON IMPLEMENTATION OF FIXES FOR THIS BILL IN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND I'M THANKFUL THAT WE HAVE A DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION THE GIVES US THE TIME TO DO THAT. SO THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH A STAKEHOLDERS TO RESOLVE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. IN THE COMING MONTHS AND WHAT THEY'RE COMMITTED IN PLACE AYE URGENT AYE VOTE ON AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE TODAY. THEY MISS OBERNOLTE. STIR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I PREACH THAT DO NEED TO SPEAK ON ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE SEVEN FIVE OF FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHORS OF FOR THEIR DILIGENCE IN THE PASSION IN THIS ISSUES. AND THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IT IS NO. SECRET THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO INVEST WITH. SOME OF THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN ADDRESSING FORWARD. AS WE'VE JUST HEARD HOWEVER ABOUT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS OUT VIV ONLY HAD THREE WORKING DAYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. AND WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE RA ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS HAS WIDE IMPLICATIONS ON COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT JUST SIMPLY IN THE BORDERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST IN THE NATION BUT GLOBALLY. THIS IS DUE DILIGENCE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO OTHER MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE REPRESENTING THE SILICON VALLEY REGION WAS CONSULTED. IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AND OF THE SAME TIME WE JUST HEARD PREVIOUSLY ON THIS PROCESS THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGING. EXERCISE THAT WE SEE HERE WHICH IS THAT OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND OBLIGATIONS ON A FAIR PROCESS. AND IT IS TO NOTE THAT WHILE THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO PROCESS MY DEAR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT IT IS THIS. THE DUTY OF THIS BODY TO ADDRESS THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES GOING FORWARD AND I ALSO HAVE HEARD IN PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS UP FROM THE AUTHORS THAT THERE ARE. A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH OUT SO AGAIN WHILE THIS IS NOT A PERFECT PROCESS IT IS ONE THAT I THINK IS. A WHAT. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ACCOMODATE OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES IN THE DEAR DEAR WORK OF MY FRIENDS ARE HERE AND I WOULD ALSO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THEY MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW MEMBERS PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. BERMAN YOUR RECOGNIZE. THINK YOU OF MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB -- THREE SEVENTY FIVE BUT WANT TO DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENT THAT THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL. THIS IS A SIMPLE CONCEPT -- BUTTON THAT POLICY BUT IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED POLICY. AS VERY NEW WANTS POLICIES -- THAT HAVEN'T BEEN IN PRINT FOR VERY LONG AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING ABOUT SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT OCCUR. UNDER THIS POLICY JUST YESTERDAY WE HEARD FROM THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO DO INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING. WAS SOMETHING THAT I HADN'T ANTICIPATED AS BEING A CONSEQUENCE -- BUT WHEN THEY READ THE BILL THEY REALIZED THAT THAT IT COULD APPLY TO THEM IN A WAY THAT I'M SURE WAS NOT INTENDED BY THE AUTHORS. OF THE BILL SO -- WHILE I RISE IN SUPPORT I WANT. TO VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS -- THAT IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE NEED TO BE MADE OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND AND YEAR EIGHTEEN MONTHS UNTIL IMPLEMENTATION -- AND THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY ALL INDUSTRIES -- TO IDENTIFY HOW THIS MIGHT APPLY TO THEM I MAKE SURE THAT ONLY APPLIES TO THEM IN THE WAYS THAT WE INTENDED AND NOT UNINTENDED -- SO WITH THAT I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI THREE SEVENTY FIVE KNOWING THAT -- WE WILL IMPROVE IT OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THEY MISSED BERMAN. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER -- I JUST I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHORED BY ME. WITHOUT OBJECTION.

WE HAVE -- CLOSED ALL THE GAPS AND EVERYONE IS SATISFIED I JUST WANTED TO ASK IF YOU HAVE MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES I WILL ADDRESS THAT IN MY CLOSING ARGUMENTS. THANK YOU IS ONE THAT'S MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF MY FRIEND FROM MODERATE PARK. AND THANK HIM. FOR LEADING THIS FIGHT. FOR SO LONG.

THANK YOU MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER HERE ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY. IS UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA AND HAS SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR THE MANY GROUNDBREAKING PRIVACY LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN AT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE YEARS. AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE ESTABLISHES THE MOST ROBUST CENTER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND RIGHTFULLY PUTS BACK IN THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE. THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW ALTAR AND PASS PRIVACY LAWS. THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AS A TOOL FOR MAKING LAWS IS NOT PERFECT OR IDEAL. AS WE'VE SEEN IN MULTIPLE DEBATES TODAY. BUT I CAN SPUR OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT ON ISSUES THAT CHALLENGE US. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AND INITIATIVES PROPONENTS FOR THEIR WORK TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S PRIVACY AND THEIR RECOGNITION THAT THE BEST VENUE TO EFFECTIVELY EFFECTUATE LAS. IS THIS HOUSE I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE CHAIR OF OUR PRIVACY COMMITTEE. AND IS STAFF OF THE MONUMENT WORK ON THIS BILL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MR CHOW. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER SPEAKER. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES A AND THE SPEAKER FOR THEIR COMMENTS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TODAY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BY GIVING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FULL OF THEIR OWN DATA. BEFORE US ARE TWO OPTIONS. OPTION ONE WE DO NOTHING AND TAKE OUR CHANCES WITH THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE. IT'S REQUIRED 70% OF THE MEMBERSHIP. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO AMEND. OR OPTION TO WE VOTE YES ON AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND CONSUMERS BY GIVING THEM THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE LEAD. AND TO SAY NO TO THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. WE HEARD COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROCESS BEING TO RASH. AND NOT INCLUSIVE. I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT THAT THE PROCESS COULD BE BETTER IF WE HAD MORE TIME. NEVERTHELESS WITHIN THE SHORT TIME SPAN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH OUT TO BUILD CONSENSUS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS. TO IMPROVE UPON THE LEGISLATION. WE ALSO HEARD TO THE BILL ITSELF MAYBE FLAW. THE BILL MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE HAD MORE TIME. YET IT IS THE WORK PRODUCT OF NUMEROUS PEOPLE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF HOURS REACHING OUT AND ATTEMPTING TO BUILD CONSENSUS. IT IT'S A WORK PRODUCT IN THE THAT THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IN ORDER TO WITHDRAW THE INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT. IT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD CLOSELY TRACK THE EUROPEAN PRIVACY MODEL GDP ARE. IT ALSO ADDRESSES PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE SAW IN CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. IT IS A FINE PRODUCT THAT COULD MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN ADVANCING THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OF CONSUMERS AND PUT. CALIFORNIA AHEAD OF THE CURVE. YEP I WON AGAIN COMMIT MYSELF TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE IF AND HOW WE COULD FINE TUNE THIS BILL BEFORE IT'S ME IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY MY HOPE ALSO IS THAT ANY. TECHNICAL CLEANUPS EMERGING ARE THAT THE REQUIRED EMERGING -- CLEAN UP WILL BE DONE THIS YEAR. FOLKS SELL DATA BREACHES IN HACKING ACTIVITIES ARE EXPLODING EXPONENTIALLY WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO AGAIN STEP UP TO THE PLATE. AND BE A LEADER IN PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY WHICH IS CLEARLY ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION. IT IS TIME FOR US TO PRESERVE THOSE RIGHTS. THE FUTURE OF YOUR DATA AND THAT OF YOUR CHILDREN IS AT STAKE.
