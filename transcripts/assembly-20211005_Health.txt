AS THE BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THIS HEARING NOTES WE HELD THE PREVIOUS HERE- SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OVERSIGHT HEARING IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. THREE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON COVERT NINETEEN IN THE STATE AND NURSING FACILITIES RESPONSE. COBIT IS STILL AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THESE FACILITIES AND THE LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEVERAL BILLS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS COBIT. MANY OF WHICH WENT TO THE OVERNOR AND ARE CURRENTLY PENDING HIS SIGNATURE OR VETO. THIS HEARING WILL BE FOCUSING ON THE NURSING. FACILITY LICENSING AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION OR SURVEY PROCESS. AND HOW THOSE AFFECT THE QUALITY OF CARE. AS WELL AS THE FACILITY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE PARTICULARLY THE USE OF RELATED PARTIES. WHILE WE BEGAN PREPARING FOR THIS HEARING HOWEVER IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE ARE CONTINUING AND EMERGING STAFFING ISSUES AS WELL THAT ALSO AFFECT THE QUALITY OF CARE. SO AS IMPORTANCE HERE SOMEWHERE WITNESSES ADDRESS OF TAT THAT ISSUE AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME SPECIAL GUESTS WITH US TODAY JOINING US ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL MURATSUCHI. ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME TO JOIN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT- INFORMATIONAL HEARING- HAS AS YOU KNOW I. HAVE A- TWO BILLS THAT DEAL WITH NURSING HOMES AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THE- DEALING WITH- THE- OF THE VERY- CHALLENGING LICENSING ISSUES THAT WE'RE- SEEING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO NURSING HOMES. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO. DELVING MORE DEEPLY INTO THESE THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MURATSUCHI MISS RODRIGUEZ AND COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRING US TOGETHER TO. TALK ABOUT THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AS YOU KNOW ME WORKING IN THE- AMBULANCE ENTRY FOR MANY YEARS I CAME ACROSS MANY. US GOOD FACILITIES WHEN THEIR CALL NINE ONE ONE CUT SEE FIRSTHAND HOW THEY REALLY OPERATE. ESPECIALLY IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS ARE REALLY. GLAD TO HEAR WHAT WE FIND OUT FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY AND MOVING FORWARD SO THANK YOU. VERY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW. GO AHEAD. TO START OUR FIRST PANEL- TO ALLOW OUR WITNESSES ADEQUATE TIME FOR THEIR TESTIMONY WILL BE HOLDING QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF EACH PANEL. WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME OUR STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWLE- KATIE CARDIN YES WITH THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. AND SONYA PADDOCK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MATAMATA AUDITOR. SO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE THE HAND OUT IT'S JUST A TWO PAGE HANDOUT I'M GOING TO USE THAT KIND OF STEP THROUGH AN AUDIT THAT WE COMPLETED IT'S A BIT DATED BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION AS YOU KNOW WE FOLLOW UP WITH AGENCIES. AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT BACK TO US AT CERTAIN INTERVALS AFTER WE'VE CONDUCTED AN AUDIT SO THE AUDIT WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY- BRIEFLY WAS ISSUED IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND YOU SENATOR MARK WHAT ARE YOU AND CENTER MCGUIRE WHERE THE REQUEST OF THIS AUDIT AND HAD PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT A VARIETY OF ISSUES SO WHAT I'M GOING TO STEP YOU THROUGH WITH THIS HAND OUT ARE THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE LOOK AT LICENSING- WE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEIR INSPECTION PRACTICES THEIR ABILITY TO ISSUE CITATIONS TIMELY AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CITATIONS ARE EFFECTIVE IN GETTING QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVED A LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION ON AND THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN CERTAINLY RELATED PARTIES SO STARTING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE MEMBERS BACK WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. WE LOOKED AT A TIME FRAME OF TWO THOUSAND SIX THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ABOUT A TEN YEAR WINDOW AND FOUND THAT DEFICIENCY SUB STANDARD CARE HAD BEEN INCREASING AND HAD INCREASED PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT THIRTY ONE PERCENT- BUT THEN ALSO SITUATIONS WHERE IT'S IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY WHERE IT WOULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM OR POTENTIALLY DEATH HAD ACTUALLY INCREASED THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHETHER PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ISSUING CITATIONS WE SAW THE OPPOSITE WE SAW THAT SIDE THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS HAD ACTUALLY DECLINED- SO WE WANTED TO SEE YEARS IT BECAUSE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS HAS THE INDUSTRY CHANGED THERE WASN'T A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE INDUSTRY AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF NURSING BEDS AVAILABLE INDUSTRY WIDE SO THERE CLEARLY WAS A PROBLEM WITH QUALITY OF CARE AND CERTAINLY AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD AND CENTER MCGUIRE. CITED IN THEIR REQUEST LETTER. SO THE FIRST AREA THAT WE LOOKED AT IS RELATED TO LICENSING AND THAT'S THE FIRST SECTION WE HAVE AND HAND OUT FOR YOU AND WHAT WE LOOK AT WE LOOK AT THREE DIFFERENT NURSING HOME FACILITY OWNERS OF PREVIOUS PLOMIN LONG WORD LONG WORD AND WANTED TO SEE HOW CONSISTENT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS IN REVIEWING APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE- AND MAKING DETERMINATIONS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCIES- WE'VE WE LOOKED AT TEN FILES WE FOUND THAT NINE FILES WERE INCOMPLETE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THOSE FILES IS PUBLIC HEALTH IS SAYING. WE LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY CITATIONS A PARTICULAR FACILITY HAD- LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES AND WE FACT USE CELLS AS FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE A LICENSE APPLICATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE LOOKED AT TEN FILES WE FOUND NINE THAT WERE INCOMPLETE THEY WERE NOT FULLY DOCUMENTING THE DEFICIENCIES ANY CITATIONS ANY COMPLAINTS THAT HAD BEEN RECEIVED- SO WHEN-WE LOOKED AT A DISTINCTION BETWEEN APPROVING A LICENSE APPLICATION FROM PLUM VERSUS ONE FROM LONG WATER FROM YES WE SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT DIFFERENT DECISIONS. SO WE REALLY HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THAT INCONSISTENCY AND WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY HAD A GOOD DEFENDABLE PROCESS- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT ARE THE FACTORS ARE WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH- EMPLOYEES RECEIVING TO DETERMINE DO I NEED TO ELEVATE THIS TO A HIGHER LEVEL TO A HIGHER LEVEL MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS RELATED TO LICENSURE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE ON THE HAND OUT WE HAVE JUST DECISIONS WERE INCONSISTENT. BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH HAD A POOR PROCESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE DOCUMENTATION. SO WE MADE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS HERE WANT TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO REQUIRE PUBLIC HEALTH TO OUTLINE THOSE FACTORS AND THAT THEY WILL CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING OR DENYING APPLICATIONS SO THERE'S SOME CONSISTENCY. THE PROPOSAL NEEDS OUTLINED SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF WOULD USE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE OR DENY. AND WHAT WE ARE SUGGESTING IS A LEGISLATURE CODIFY. ESTABLISH A STATUTE THAT KIND OF LAYS OUT WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH PUT TOGETHER AS FAR AS WHAT THE FACTOR SHOULD BE. AND WHAT TYPES OF CONSIDERATIONS PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD. SHOULD BE ADDRESSING. AS YOU CAN SEE IN OUR DOCUMENT WE LOOKED AT AB FIFTY NO TO THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TUCCI HAS AUTHORED AND I'M IT'S M UNDERSTANDING IT IS- A TWO YEAR BUILT- BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT LEGISLATION THAT BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF THE BILL ADDRESSES THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD AND IT WILL CODIFY SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. WHEN THEY'RE ASSESSING AND WHEN THEY'RE ESTABLISHING WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE AS A CONSISTENT STRONG ROBUST LICENSING REVIEW PROCESS SO WE THINK THAT. LEGISLATION GOES A LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED. IN THE AUDIT A FEW YEARS AGO. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR LICENSING REVIEW PROCESS AND WE LAID OUT HERE AND BULLETS. ENSURING THAT THE ANALYST COMPLETE. STANDARDIZED REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS MAKE SURE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THE CITATIONS THE CAUGHT THAT THE DEFICIENCIES AT CETERA. DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS WILL BE INCLUDED. IN THEIR ANALYSIS AND HOW DO THEY WAIT THOSE FACTORS WHICH FACTORS ARE PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS WE REALLY DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. AND THEN DEVELOPING THAT THRESHOLD IS THERE A THRESHOLD WHERE I HAVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CITATIONS. THAT I AS AN ANALYST AT PUBLIC HEALTH NEED TO ELEVATE THIS TO HIGHER LEVEL MANAGEMENT. SO THAT- THERE'S CONSISTENT AGAIN PROCESS AND DECISION MAKING. AND THEN ADEQUATELY DOCUMENT THOSE DECISIONS AS WELL AS I SAID IN NINE OF THE TEN APPLICATIONS WE LOOKED AT. WE SAW INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS POOR DOCUMENTATION IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO EXPLAIN TO US BASED ON THE MATERIALS IN THE FILES. WHY DID YOU APPROVE THIS APPLICATION AND WHITED VERSES DENYING THIS OTHER ONE SO THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY. AS YOU CAN SEE AND THE AND THE HANDOUT WE'RE SAYING PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. SO PUBLIC HEALTH HAS IMPLEMENTED SOME PROCESSES TO STANDARDIZE LICENSING REVIEW. THEY'VE CREATED SOME OF THOSE THRESHOLDS THAT WOULD PROMPT. ANALYSTS TO ELEVATE. THE FIRST. LINE THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH HAS NOT DETERMINED HOW ANALYSTS WILL WEIGH THE FACTORS- AS RECENTLY AS THIS PAST THURSDAY OR FRIDAY EVENING WE RECEIVE SOME MATERIALS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT THEY ARE HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY REVIEW THOSE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT FULLY ADDRESSES. OUR CONCERNS BUT THAT'S KIND OF LATE BREAKING NEWS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I. I SHARE THAT WITH YOU TODAY BUT AT THIS POINT UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT. WE BELIEVE THIS IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED THEY NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK. SO THAT WAS THE FIRST AREA OF THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WE LOOKED AT AS FAR AS LICENSING AND THE CONSISTENCY AND WHAT FACTORS ARE USING ARE YOU TRAINING YOUR ALICE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. THE SECOND AREA WANT TO TALK ABOUT STATE RELICENSING INSPECTIONS. AND THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE STATE LAW REQUIRES THE INSPECTORS INSPECTIONS TO BE DONE EVERY TWO YEARS. AND IT'S TO ENSURE THAT FACILITIES ARE. YOU KNOW COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW. AND MEETING THE QUALITY OF STANDARD REQUIREMENTS THAT A NURSING FACILITY SHOULD MEET. WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT AGAIN WE ISSUED THIS REPORT BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WHAT WE FOUND IS PUBLIC HEALTH WAS PRIORITIZING THEIR FEDERAL. RELICENSING INSPECTIONS ARE THERE FEDERAL INSPECTIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE INSPECTIONS PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS. AS WE CITED IN THE REPORT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IS EVERY FIFTEEN MONTHS A FACILITY HAS TO BE REVIEWED. THE STATE LAW REQUIRES A STATE INSPECTION AS I SAID EVERY TWO YEARS SO IT'S TWENTY FOUR MONTHS IT WAS A DIFFERENT CYCLE. SO WHAT WE SUGGESTED IS. WE MAKE THE STATE INSPECTIONS PERHAPS THIRTY MONTHS AND THEN IT WOULD BE EASIER BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH SAID IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE THE TIMING IS DIFFERENT. WELL IF YOU MAKE ONE THIRTY MONTHS AND ONE FIFTEEN MONTHS IT'S RELATIVELY EASY. TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS TOGETHER BECAUSE THE STATE INSPECTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN STATE LAW ARE MORE STRINGENT. AND MORE ARE NOT ACTUALLY WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF ENSURING QUALITY OF CARE IN CALIFORNIA SO- THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE DOING THEIR FOR THOSE STATE RELICENSING INSPECTIONS- WE MADE A RECOMMENDATION THE LEGISLATURE THAT REQUIRES PUBLIC HEALTH TO CONDUCT THOSE STATE. AND FEDERAL INSPECTIONS CONCURRENTLY AND I ALS WANTTO POINT OUT WHAT WE SAID IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS A LEGISLATURE DID TAKE ACTION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THAT GAVE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE AUTHORITY TO DO DUAL INSPECTIONS GO OUT THERE DO YOUR FEDERAL INSPECTION AND YOUR STATE INSPECTION AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT- BUT THEY WEREN'T DOING IT AND THAT WE STILL THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP THAT DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO TAKE IS. GET THOSE TWO INSPECTIONS COMBINED MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THE STATE INSPECTION THE RELICENSING INSPECTION WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE FEDERAL INSPECTION- PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOKED AT. THE NUMBER OF STATE FEDERAL OR STATE RELICENSING INSPECTIONS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS PERFORMING. WE LOOKED AT TWO YEARS BECAUSE IT'S A TWENTY FOUR MONTH. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED SO THEY'RE DOING ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE WHEN WE DUG A LITTLE DEEPER MANY OF THOSE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OCCURRING AND LOS ANGELES. BECAUSE L. A. COUNTY OF COURSE HAS A HIGH NUMBER OF NURSING HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE FACILITIES AND THE LOS ANGELES AREA WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT. HAD NOT BEEN GETTING NO STATE RELICENSING INSPECTION SO AGAIN SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE WOULD REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. THE NEXT AREA CITATIONS- AND CITATIONS ARE IMPORTANT OF COURSE- TO TWO THINGS RELATED TO CITATIONS THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THE AUDIT REPORT. TIMELINESS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY IS AN INCENTIVE FOR A FACILITY TO IMPROVE A PENALTY THE UP TO P2P HAVE TO PAY A PENALTY. WHAT WE FOUND WITH- TIMELINESS. THE STATE LAW REQUIRES PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE A CITATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. AFTER COMPLETING AN INVESTIGATION- BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT TIME FRAME TWO THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THEY ISSUED MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED OF THEIR CITATIONS ISSUED ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND. THEY ISSUED ELEVEN HUNDRED MORE THAN SIX MONTHS. NOT THIRTY DAYS MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER THEY COMPLETED THAT INSPECTION. SO THAT IS VERY POOR PERFORMANCE- ONLY ABOUT- 60% OR SO- WERE WITHIN. NOW 67% WERE MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS. 28% WERE MORE THAN SIX MONTHS SO SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE CITATIONS BEING ISSUED VERY VERY LATE. WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO THE STATE- LAW REQUIREMENT OF THIRTY DAYS. NOW ARE THESE. PENALTIES SERVING AS AN EFFECTIVE DISINCENTIVE OR AN INCENTIVE FORCE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE. AND AGAIN WE FOUND THAT NOT NECESSARILY TO BE TRUE- BECAUSE A LOT OF THE FACILITIES WERE ABLE TO LATER PAID FOR. THE CITATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND THEY GET A 35% DISCOUNT TO CENTER- AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY AND THAT'S STILL IN STATE LAW THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT. BUT WHAT WE WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE AMOUNT FOR THOSE CITATIONS THE AMOUNTS FOR MANY OF THEM HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED FOR A LONG TIME- IN FACT SOME HAD BEEN THE SAME AMOUNT SINCE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. AND WE COMPLETED THE AUDIT AND ISSUED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND WE HAVE IT IN IN THE HAND OUT. THAT AB THREE TWENTY THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA BILL WAS- ACTUALLYSIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST NIGHT. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE THAT DID INCREASE THOSE. A CITATION AMOUNTS FOR ALL THE CITATIONS ACROSS THE BORDER TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT THE BILL THIS MORNING AND ABSOLUTELY IT INCREASES A LOT OF THOSE. SO THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE AN INCENTIVE FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES TO WANT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND IN THEIR AND THEIR PARTICULAR- NURSING HOMES. ONE THING THAT IT WAS NOT IN HIS BILL THAT WASN'T A BILL IN THE PAST WAS THE INFLATION FACTOR WE WERE SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD BE AN INFLATION FACTOR- THERE WAS A BILL. MR CALLER AGAIN AUTHORED A BILL- A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUDIT THAT DID INCLUDE THAT. INFLATION FACTOR UNFORTUNATELY THAT BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITH IT WITH THE BILL THAT WAS. SIGNED HAVING AN INFLATION FACTOR ALSO IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. FOR CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT WILL AGAIN BE AN INCENTIVE FOR SOME OF THESE FACILITIES THESE THESE. PENALTY AMOUNTS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP AT LEAST ANNUALLY BASED ON CPI SO YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED TO IMPROVE THE CARE I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PAYING THESE. THESE THESE CITATIONS THE CITATION AMOUNTS THESE PENALTIES. SO AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF GETTING ALL CITATIONS ISSUED TIMELY. I THINK THAT THE INCREASE IN THE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CITATIONS HOPEFULLY WILL BE AN INCENTIVE. FOR THE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT THEY PROVIDE. SO MOVING ON TO JUST A COUPLE MARC MAUER AREAS INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WE LOOKED AT THE- THE QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVEMENT THE A. Q. A. S. P. WHICH WAS INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE NURSING HOMES TO IMPROVE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF FACILITIES WEREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE THEY EITHER HAD SOME DEFICIENCIES. OR THEY HAD SOME CITATIONS BUT WHAT WE DID FIND IS THOSE THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PAYMENTS. YOU DID SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IT WITH THOSE FACILITIES THEY GOT THAT MONEY THEY WERE ABLE TO INVEST THAT MONEY IN THE QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVED AT THOSE FACILITIES SO THERE'S INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE IMPORTANT. IT WAS JUST FOR US- WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT WE FOUND THAT. THE WAY THE- THE PROGRAM WAS SET UP AS IS MANY FACILITIES AND TYPICALLY THE ONES THAT ARE NOT AS PROFITABLE REALLY STRUGGLE TO EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. SO WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AS WELL AS FAR AS- OCCUPIED CREATING A SCHEDULE THAT WOULD ALLOW ON THE ANNUAL COST REPORT. COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO REPORT HOW MUCH ARE WE INVESTING IN QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVEMENTS- OCCUPIED IS SUGGESTING. THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO A REGULATORY CHANGE SO THEY HAVEN'T FULLY IMPLEMENTED THAT RECOMMENDATION YET BUT AGAIN WE STILL FEEL. THAT THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. WE ALSO HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS RELATED TO. THE QUALITY OF CARE IMPROVEMENT PAYMENTS WHERE. AS YOU KNOW I'M SURE THERE WAS. LEGISLATION ESTABLISHED AND IT ALLOWED US AS A STATE TO GET MORE FEDERAL MATCHING MONEY. WE SUGGESTED THERE SHOULD PERHAPS BE SOME RESTRUCTURING OF HOW THOSE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- ARE PROVIDED TO DIFFERENT FACILITIES WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF ACTION BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A WORKING GROUP LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT. THE LAST AREA WANTED TO GO THROUGH RELATIVELY QUICKLY AS A RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS- THIS IS AN AREA THAT WAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO YOU MISTER WOULD AND CERTAINLY CENTER MCGUIRE. WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY A PRACTICE THAT'S LEGALLY ALLOWABLE- THE COMPANIES THAT WE LOOKED AT BREA'S PLOMIN AND LONG WITH AT THE TIME. THANK THEIR THEIR PROFITS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF RELATE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS BUT WHAT WE FOUND THERE WASN'T ENOUGH DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY. AROUND THESE- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND SOME OF THE FORMS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS USING. DIDN'T REALLY ALLOW FOR PROPER DISCLOSURE. DOCTOR WOULD OF COURSE YOU AUTHORED AB NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WHICH WE MENTIONED HERE AND THE HAND OUT. THAT WAS. A DIRECT RESPONSE TO A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD TO THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE NURSING FACILITIES TO SUBMIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THESE RELATED PARTIES PROFIT LOSS STATEMENTS- TO D. D. H. C. S. HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND THE REASON HEALTH CARE SERVICES IMPORTANT THEY USE THIS INFORMATION THEY'RE ABLE NOW TO USE IT. TO DETERMINE WHICH PLACES THEY WANT TO AUDIT OR TO REALLY DO SOME ANALYSIS. OF SOME OF THE FACILITIES AND PERHAPS USE A RISK BASED ASSESSMENT WHICH AUDITORS DO IF THERE'S NON PROFITS ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD WE NEED OR IF THERE'S- A CHANGE WE START LOOKING AT TRENDS AND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THEN THAT MIGHT BE A PLACE THAT THE AUDITORS AT DH CS MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT. SO THAT BILL CERTAINLY DID- IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND CERTAINLY CREATED MORE TRANSPARENCY. THE OTHER AREA THAT WE THINK NEEDS- NEEDED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IS THE OCCUPIED ANNUAL COST REPORTS SO AS YOU KNOW NURSING FACILITIES HAVE TO REPORT INFORMATION TO. OUR SPOT I KNOW THEIR CHECK NAME HAS CHANGED RECENTLY BUT I'LL KEEP ON MARCH PART. FOR THIS POINT- THEY ANNUAL COURTS THAT FOR. HAVE TO REPORT INFORMATION TO THEM BUT WHETHER ANNUAL COST REPORT DIDN'T ALLOW FOR IS ALL OF THE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. THEY ONLY HAD FIVE LINES ON THE FORM SO BASICALLY WHAT OCCUPIED WAS TELLING. A NURSING HOME FACILITIES IS. LIST THE FIVE BIGGEST. AND THEN. AGGREGATE EVERYTHING ELSE SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY TELL WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN ANNUAL REPORT. HOW MANY OF THESE THESE TYPES OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS ARE OCCURRING WHAT TYPES OF GOODS AND SERVICES YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT SO WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING GOSH PRIDE. IS UPDATE THAT ANNUAL COST REPORT TO ENABLE NURSING FACILITY TO FULLY DISCLOSE ALL OF THEIR RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE TALK ABOUT OTHER STATES HAVE HAD THAT TYPE OF PROCESS OR THAT TYPE OF REPORTING AVAILABLE AND IT REALLY DOES ALLOW FOR FULL TRANSPARENCY- SO WE SUGGESTED TO ASHFORD CHANGE YOUR ANNUAL COST REPORT TO ALLOW. NURSING FACILITIES AND ALLOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAPTURE INFORMATION THAT REFLECTS. ALL OF THE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS A PARTICULAR NURSING FACILITY HAS HAD- IN ADDITION TO THAT- WE WERE WE WERE. SUGGESTING THAT OFSHE PART ALSO PROVIDE A SINGLE LOCATION SO YOU CAN TYPE WHICH OF THOSE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE AND WE SAY IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT THE STATE DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT. THE THERE WAS A LIMIT AS FAR AS A NUMBER OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT THE STATE ACTUALLY DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF. CONTROLLING THAT MONITORING THAT BUT AGAIN WE FELT AT THAT ANNUAL COST REPORT IS A VEHICLE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO IT IS AS FAR AS OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE ARE MONITORING ROLE ETCETERA- AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE HAND OUT EFFECTIVE APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY- WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUPPORT IS FULLY THEY PROVIDED US EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THAT RECOMMENDATION. NOW JUST ONE LAST THING MEMBERS SO AS YOU KNOW WE SHOULD REPORT IN MAY OF TWENTY. ARE STANDARD PRACTICES SIXTY DAY SIX MONTHS ONE YEAR BUT SUBSEQUENT TO THAT ONE YEAR WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR STATE AGENCIES. IF THEY HAVE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND THE MOST RECENT UPDATE WE HAD. I WAS IN TWENTY TWENTY WELL I DON'T THINK WE RECEIVED ANYTHING FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE GETTING A FEW THINGS BECAUSE OF THIS HEARING- QUITE FRANKLY. FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE APPRECIATE THAT AS I SAID WEWILL LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION. AND BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AS FAR AS- THAT ONE LATE BREAKING UP PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT. PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDED TO US SO THIS WHAT WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR- MY KßT AND I WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU AND WE'LL HOLD QUESTIONS ARE FOR THE SPELL CANTIL WE HEAR FROM MATHEMATICS HONEST TO STAY UP HERE SURE IF YOU DON'T MIND WHICH IS. TRADE SO WE WHICH WE CONNECT YOU COULD STAND IF YOU LIKE OR- OKAY OKAY SURE. THIS HECK I DON'T KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW. AB AREA. THANK YOU GOOD I MISS CHAIR AND MY I'M SO NEW PRODUCT THE LARGEST PANEL OFFICE OUR OFFICE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IN THE CONTEXT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO THIS WILL REALLY BE TAKING A STEP BACK FROM WHAT THE AUDITOR JUST PRESENTED AND JUST GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF- YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THE HANDOUTTHAT WE PREPARED AND THIS IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AT L. A. O. DOT CA DOT GOV. SO JUST- A QUICK OVERVIEW THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT- CONDUCTS OVERSIGHT OF MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND HEALTH FACILITIES IN THE STATE. THIS INCLUDES GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS HOSPICES DIALYSIS CLINICS- AND ALSO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- THIS WORK IS DONE IN FOURTEEN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS INCLUDING LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WHILE DEPARTMENT STAFF DO THE WORK- THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE STATE IT CONTRACTS WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- FOR OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN THAT COUNTY. SO WHY A LICENSE- REALLY ALLOWS A FACILITY TO OPERATE IN THE STATE IT'S A IT'S A STE. A LICENSES REQUIRED BY STATE LAW WHERE CERTIFICATION IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IF THE FACILITY WISHES TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM. THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS ENROLLED IN THOSE PROGRAMS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE I'LL JUST GO OVER SOME OF THE KEY RESPONSIBILITIES- IN STATUTE THESE ARE LAID OUT ON PAGES THREE FOUR AND FIVE. AND I'LL TRY NOT TO DUPLICATE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR ALREADY MENTIONED REALLY THE KEY RESPONSIBILITIES. INCLUDE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS- IN ADDITION TO RENEWING LICENSES AND DOING RECERTIFICATION. IT INVOLVES- INSPECTIONS- ALSO KNOWN AS SURVEYS IT INCLUDES CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS OF COMPLAINTS AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS IT INCLUDES ISSUING CITATIONS AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO REPORTING SO FOR EXAMPLE IT HAS TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL COST ESTIMATE WHICH ALSO INCLUDES SORT OF PROJECTIONS OF WORKLOAD- IN ADDITION IT HAS TO REPORT CERTAIN PERFORMANCE METRICS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS ONLINE. I AM SO WELL THE HANDOUT DOES INCLUDE SOME MORE DETAIL ON EACH OF THOSE I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST- HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE A STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE IT ARE IN ADDITION TO. WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID- AS WELL AS IN ADDITION TO STATE REGULATIONS AND THEN DEPARTMENTAL POLICY- SO THE PROGRAM MUST REVIEW IN PROCESS APPLICATIONS NOT ONLY FOR NEW LICENSES BUT ALSO FOR CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP- AND OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE THE LICENSE NUMBER OF BEDS NAME LOCATION- AND THEN MANY OF THESE APPLICATIONS REQUIRE AN ON SITE INSPECTION IN ADDITION TO THE PAPERWORK PART OF THE APPLICATION. AND THEN AS ALREADY NOTED BY THE AUDITOR THE PROGRAM MUST ALSO CONDUCT PERIODIC UNANNOUNCED ON SITE SURVEYS AS PART OF THE LICENSE RENEWAL OR RE CERTIFICATION PROCESS- THE DEPARTMENT MUST CONDUCT- THEIR BROTHER THEIR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- AROUND THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE PROGRAM MUST CONDUCT- SO FOR EXAMPLE AN ON SITE INVESTIGATION MUST BE INITIATED FOR A COMPLAINT WITHIN TEN DAYS HOWEVER IF THAT COMPLAINT CONSTITUTES IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY AS EARLIER DESCRIBED- THE DEPARTMENT MUST IN INITIATE THAT INVESTIGATION WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER SOME HIGHLIGHTS FROM RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. AND I WOULD NOT THAT OUR HAND OUT INCLUDES A SORT OF A FULL LISTING OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS- INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS AND A NUMBER OF POSITIONS BUT JUST IN SOME. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE STATE ANNUAL STATE BUDGETS HAVE ADDED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ANNUALLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS M. PROVIDED AUTHORITY FOR ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. CURRENTLY THE TOTAL LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM BUDGET IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION AND INCLUDES NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED POSITIONS. SO JUST TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE EXAMPLES FROM THE FROM THE BUDGET OUT ACTIONS- IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVED APPROVAL TO CONDUCT A GAP ANALYSIS- IT IT CONTRACTED WITH AN OUTSIDE COMPANY. AND THE DEPARTMENT STILL IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IT ALSO RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS BASED ON ITS WORKLOAD ANALYSIS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY THESE INCREASES TOOK PLACE IN THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN BUDGET AND THEN AGAIN IN TWENTY. TWENTY ONE I'M IN THIS INCLUDED POSITION OF THIRTY FOR NURSE SURVEYORS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT- IT ALSO NOTE THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED APPROVAL TO EXECUTE A NEW PERFORMANCE BASED CONTRACT WITH THE LUSH BLESS ANGELES COUNTY. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THE COUNTY NOW HAS TO MEET CERTAIN PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE CERTAIN- INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. AND THEN I WOULD JUST NOTE WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON- THE LET THE BUDGETS FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS INCLUDED THE CENTRALIZATION OF SOME. FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO PATIENT CARE SORT OF INSPECTIONS OR INVESTIGATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF MEDICAL BREACHES OR- THE- WHEN A PATIENT'S MEDICAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY- HAS BEEN CENTRALIZED TO THE DEPARTMENT- RATHER THAN THE FIELD OFFICES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO RECEIVED APPROVAL TO CENTRALIZE ITS POLICY INTERPRETATION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE AUDITOR WAS TALKING ABOUT LIKE IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY OF. INTERPRETING POLICY AND APPLYING- ISSUING SPEED CITATIONS AND- THE LIKE- SO THAT JUST THOSE TWO THINGS JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHTY I WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE- CURRENT PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT ARE AND I A- WHAT DID THIS INFORMATION FROM THE ON LINE DASHBOARDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT CREATED AS A RESULT OF A BUDGET REQUIREMENTS I'M A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. SO I WOULD ALSO WANT I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE BACKGROUND PIECE FOR THIS HEARING INCLUDED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL HELPFUL DETAIL ON OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS- SO. FIRST I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STAFFING LEVEL OF NURSE SURVEYORS WHO WHO ARE ALSO KNOWN AS HEALTH FACILITY EVALUATOR NURSES. THESE ARE THE- INDIVIDUALS WHO REALLY LEAD THE INVESTIGATIONS AND LEAD THE SURVEYS. RIGHT NOW ABOUT 70% OF THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM STAFF IS LOCATED IN THE FIELD OFFICES AND THEN AMONG THE FIELD OFFICES OF A MAJORITY OF THOSE STAFF ARE THESE INNER SURVEYORS- HOWEVER THE RETENTION SORRY THE RECRUITMENT HIRING AND RETENTION OF THESE POSITIONS HAS BEEN SORT OF AN ONGOING CHALLENGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT ONCE A POSITION IS HIRED IT TYPICALLY TAKES ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN THAT. THAT INDIVIDUAL- THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT SHOWS THAT VACANCY RATES IN THIS POSITION. AT FIRST- I'M SORRY TO VACANCY RATES FOR THE NURSE SURVEYOR POSITION- WENT UP. UNDERSTANDABLY WITH THE ADDITION OF NEW POSITIONS IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THIS ALSO HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN NEW POSITIONS WERE ADDED AND ALSO BECAUSE OF COATED. THE DEPARTMENT EXPERIENCED MORE DEPARTURES AND RETIREMENTS THAN WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN EXPECTED- BUT THE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT FROM SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE DEPARTMENT'S WORKLOAD ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDED MANY MORE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS TO CONDUCTS THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T REQUEST ADDITIONAL POSITIONS HOWEVER BECAUSE IT WAS HAVING TROUBLE FILLING OPEN POSITIONS THAT I ALREADY HAD A THIRTY FOUR. SO IT DIDN'T MAKE ANOTHER REQUEST UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE VACANCY RATE HAD GOTTEN DOWN TO THREE POINT NINETEEN HIT. AND WE HAVE NEW CHALLENGES- BECAUSE OF THAT. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE I WAS GOING TO MENTION. SOME OF THE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL AREAS- SO FIRST IS CENTRALIZED APPLICATION PROCESSING SO IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE DEPARTMENT WRIST- BEGAN TO CENTRALIZE SORT OF STEP ONE OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS BASICALLY. DEALING WITH THE PAPERWORK AND THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWING THE APPLICATION. BY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED THAT IT REALIZED IT HAD UNDER ESTIMATED THE WORK. ASSOCIATED WITH PROCESSING THOSE APPLICATIONS AND IT BEGAN TO HIRE. IT REQUESTED AUTHORITY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO MAKE THOSE POSITIONS PERMANENT. THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE NINE SHOWS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROCESSING TIMES AN AGE OF OPEN APPLICATIONS DURING THIS INITIAL STEP- SO FOR EXAMPLE BY QUARTER TWO OF NINETEEN TWENTY THE NUMBER OF OPEN APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY MORE THAN HALF COMPARED TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND NEARLY TWO THIRDS HAD ONLY BEEN OPEN. FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED DAYS OR LESS STILL THIS CAN TAKE SOME TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATIONS WHICH I KNOW IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST- THE CURRENT MEDIAN AGE OF AN APPLICATION IS ABOUT NINE MONTHS AND THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP OF THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATION PROCESS. SO THE SECOND STEP IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN AND INVOLVES THE ON SITE. SURVEY AND THEN OF COURSE THESE ARE ALSO CONDUCTED AS THE REGULAR- PART OF. RENEWING THE LICENSE AND RE CERTIFICATION- THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED THE TIMELINESS OF COMPLETION OF THESE LICENSOR LICENSURE SURVEYS. SO AT THE END OF MARCH THERE WERE THIRTY TWO APPLICATIONS AWAITING A SURVEY. AND THE MEDIAN AGE OF THESE APPLICATION- LICENSURE SURVEY SURVEYS TO COMPLETE THE APPLICATION WAS NEARLY ONE YEAR- SO IF WE GO BACK TO OUR EXAMPLE OF THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATION. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE APPLICATIONS AWAITING A LICENSE OR SURVEY WAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DAYS. THIS MEANS THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH FOR A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP COULD TAKE. A YEAR AND A HALF OR MORE. I'M NEXT I WOULD- JUST HIGHLIGHT A COMPLAINT THE COMPLETION OF COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS- THERE'S A GRAPHIC ON PAGE ELEVEN. SO AS YOU KNOW- THE STATE BUDGET IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. I REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN PHASING IN SHORTER TIMELINES TO TURN AROUND COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS AND IT TASTED IN MORE AGGRESSIVELY FOR THOSE. COMPLAINTS THAT INVOLVED IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY- SO SINCE JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALL OF THESE COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. HOWEVER THE GRAPHIC SHOWS THAT SINCE THE RECORD THE SIXTY DAY REQUIREMENT TOOK EFFECT THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T MET THE TIMELINE IN AT LEAST IS BECOME NOTABLY WORSE SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. I'M SO THE LAST THING I WOULD JUST MENTION A IS ENFORCEMENT WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED BUT I WOULD JUST ALSO POINT OUT THAT- OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE DEPRTMENT TOOK ON AVERAGE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS TO ISSUE MORE THAN TWO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORE SERIOUS SORT OF TYPE A AND TYPE A- TYPE B. VIOLATIONS- FACILITIES CAN APPEAL THESE PENALTIES WHICH FURTHER- DELAYS THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. AND THEN THIS IS PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED IFISA FACILITY IS UNDERGOING A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP- AND IF THAT PART OF THE PROCESS IS ALSO DELAYED- YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE THAT COULD SORT OF COMPLICATED ABOUT WHO'S WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. SO I JUST WANT TO END. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWELVE WITH SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WELLTHIS HEARING IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN WE KNOW THAT COVERED NINETEEN IS REVEALED SOME ISSUES IN. ITS SOME LONGSTANDING ISSUES AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD OVERSIGHT. YET OF THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO HAMPERED THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT ITS OVERSIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS NOT ONLY IS IT HARDER TO CONDUCT TO THE ON SITE INVESTIGATIONS. BUT THE STAFF IS REALLY HAD TO PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE INFECTION CONTROL- SORT OF AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND THEN IN ADDITION WE HAVE THE HIGHER VACANCIES FOR THE NURSE SURVEYOR POSITIONS. AND IN FACT A RECENT STATISTICS FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE SHOWS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT YET TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW POSITION OF AUTHORITY- APPROVED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO JUST SOME ISSUES THAT WE WOULD RAISE OR QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER IS WHAT HAS BEEN LEARNED FROM COVERT NINETEEN THAT SHOULD BE BUILT IN PERMANENTLY TO THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM AND OVERSIGHT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- WHAT ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS WOULD HELP THE PROGRAM NOT ONLY TO IMPROVE TIMELINES BUT TO ALSO IMPROVE CONSISTENCY. AND QUALITY OF OVERSIGHT- WHAT HAS BEEN THE EFFECT OF CENTRALIZING SOME OF THE TASKS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR FROM APPLICATION PROCESSING TO MEDICAL BREACH INVESTIGATIONS IN POLICY INTERPRETATION. HOW IS IT HELPED AND HASN'T LED TO ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THEN JUST HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO ADDRESS- CHALLENGES SUCH AS HIRING AND RETAINING NURSE SURVEYORS AND SPEEDING UP- THE APPLICATION. PROCESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND TURN TO OUR MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF I DO HAVE QUESTIONS BUT ALL ALL GO LAST SO PLEASE. MISS RODRIGUEZ AND QUICK QUESTION- IN THE BEGINNING LEAN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE STATE AND FEDERAL EXPECTATIONS. ARE THOSE ANNOUNCED OR UNANNOUNCED. ALSO THAT ARE ON AND- GONNA. OKAY I WAS JUST MY QUESTIONS ONE CONFIRM THANK YOU. HUMANOS MISTER MESSAGING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SERVICE CHAIRMAN- HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR OUR STATE AUDITOR- SO- THIS HOW YOU- AND YOUR YOUR HAND OUT YOU ADDRESS THE AREA OF PUBLIC HEALTH OVERSIGHT AS IT RELATES TO LICENSING- AND YOU STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF- CONSISTENCY- AND DOCUMENTATION. AND YOU FOUND THAT LACKING. AT LEAST AS THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- REVEALED- CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. AND SO ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT- THAT- YOU AND YOUR OFFICE IS RECOMMENDING IS- TO- SPECIFY TO OUTLINE THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA INCLUDING RELEVANT QUALITY OF CARE METRICS AND THAT THAT SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND CODIFIED. THAT'S CORRECT MR TWO GS- YOU KNOW. SERVICE SO AS YOU INDICATED- I HAVE A BILL THAT'S THAT'S PROPOSING TO CODIFY THAT- FOLLOWING YOUR RECOMMENDATION- BUT- YOU. EVEN BEFORE WE GET TO THAT STEP I MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE BASIC PURPOSE OF- V. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S LICENSING OF A NURSING HOME. YEAH. SO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS LOOKING AT LICENSING A NURSING HOME REALLY WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO ENSURE IS THAT THE NURSING HOME OWNERS AND ANYONE WHO'S INVOLVED A LOT OF THESE AREN'T INDIVIDUALS ARE LARGE COMPANIES AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES CAN BE QUITE COMPLICATED THEY'RE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT ITS ESSENTIALLY A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO LICENSE THAT NURSING HOME TO RUN IT- SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT PAST PRACTICES IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE YOU THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BE ABLE. TO- MAINTAIN THAT NURSING HOME AT A HIGH LEVEL OF QUALITY OF CARE. SO. WE HAVE A THE STATE OF- OUR LICENSING SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS RELATES NURSING HOMES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT. ATTAR OF- IN NUMEROUS- NEWS ARTICLES- THE SACRAMENTO BEE RAN A MAJOR. EXPOSE ON THE STATE OF ON THE PROBLEMS THAT THE GLARING PROBLEMS WITH THE LACK OF STATE OVERSIGHT OVER THE NURSING HOMES LICENSING PROCESS AND- SEVEN YEARS LATER- WE CONTINUE TO SEE. SIMILAR PROBLEMS- ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR- WHICH WAS JUST COVERED IN. CALMATTERS YESTERDAY HIGHLIGHTS A LAWSUIT. THAT WAS FILED AGAINST- ONE OF THE CHAINS THAT YOU'RE AUDIT ADDRESSED A BRIEF HEALTHCARE. AND- THIS LAWSUIT IS HIGHLIGHTING A ALL TOO COMMON SITUATION WHERE EVEN THOUGH A- WHAT THE NURSING HOME OWNER. HAS HAD ITS LICENCE APPLICATION DENIED FIVE YEARS AGO IN. JULY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT THIS NURSING HOME IS CONTINUE TO OPERATE. BUT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF USING WHAT ARE CALLED INTERIM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. SO I MEAN AS THE STATE AUDITOR YOU KNOW KNOWING THAT. THE LICENSE TO OPERATE A NURSING HOME IS THAT THE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL- STEP. THAT IS TAKEN TO REGULATE- THESE NURSING HOMES. I MEAN DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU THAT IS THAT A NURSING HOME CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE WHEN THE OWNERS APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE HAS BEEN DENIED FIVE YEARS AGO. NOT A- THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI NOW AND AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT PREVIOUS WAS ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT HAD. MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS I THINK THERE REFER TO FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND THAT'S WHY WE REALLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A GOOD STRONG PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION AND THEY'RE NOT HESITATING. TO DENY A LICENSE OR TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AND BE ABLE TO DEFEND THAT DETERMINATION THAT THIS FACILITY AS AS K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; INDICATED HAVE TOO MANY CITATIONS HAD TUESDAY TO MANY DEFICIENCIES WE IN GOOD CONSCIENCE AS A STATE. CANNOT AUTHORIZE A LICENSE FOR THAT FACILITY SO TWO TWO SIX THANK PLAY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AFTER I WENT OUT A LITTLE BIT NO I THINK FOR A LOT FOR A FACILITY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE USING A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT OR MANAGEMENT. NOW CONTRACT TYPE THING. DOES NOT MAKE SENSE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO HAVE A STRONG PROCESS TO DETERMINE. YES THIS IS A FACILITY WHERE WE BELIEVE OUR ELDERS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF OR SOMEONE WHO NEEDS NEW JUST NEEDS THAT KIND OF CARE AND AS SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE AS A STATE THAT THE FACILITY IS CAPABLE OF CARING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE CANNOT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. THOSE DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE AND THEY NEED TO BE MADE PROMPTLY. THANK YOU AND FOLLOWING THAT- OBSERVATION- WE HAVE A SITUATION WELL THE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH POSITION IS THAT. IS THAT TO IN THIS CASE OF FOCUSING ON THIS EXAMPLE OF THE WINDS ARE READING FACILITY- U. P. OWNER- MR SHLOMO RECHNITZ HAD TO. PURCHASE THIS PROPERTY FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND THE AND THE PREVIOUS OR THE LICENSEE OF THIS FACILITY WINDS ARE READING. THE APPLICATION WAS DENIED AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND YET THE OPERATION OF THE NURSING HOME CONTINUES WITH THE LICENSEE BEING THE PREVIOUS OWNER WINS ARE READY RIGHT. I MEAN WHAT. WHAT IF ANY. PUBLIC PROTECTION CONSUMER PROTECTION FUNCTION. DOES TREATING THE LICENSEE OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER- SERVE- IN IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE. WELL I I'M NOT SURE THERE IS A MINUTE AGAIN I HAVE TO DEFER TO PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN SO IF YOUR GOING TO DENY THE LICENSE OF THE NEW OWNER. BASED ON- CITATIONS DEFICIENCIES THAT THE PREVIOUS LICENSEE- EXPERIENCED AS FAR AS PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDING OVERSIGHT THEN I WOULD THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND SUGGESTED THAT FACILITY SHOULD NOT BE LICENSE AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AS FAR AS- IT HAD BEEN DENIED. BUT AND I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS THAT THE STATE WOULD NEED TO TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FACILITY DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPERATE IF IT HAS HAD A HISTORY OF DEFICIENCIES AND BEING CITED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN DENIED A LICENSE THAT THAT THAT. TO ME FROM PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE- IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OR HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS- IN THAT PARTICULAR NURSING HOME BUT AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT STEPS THAT THE STATE WOULD NEED TO TAKE. IF I MAY I HAVE WRAPPED UP- THE FOLLOWING THAT- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEWS IS THE COMPLIANCE HISTORY- OF THE APPLICANT- THE COMPLIANCE HISTORY OF THE FACILITIES OWNED MANAGED OR OPERATED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE APPLICANT. AGAIN WE WERE PRESENTED WITH THIS- THIS- THIS CASE FILED AGAINST- APPLICANTS SLOW MO RECHNITZ. WHO ACCORDING TO THIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DENIAL BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THEY WERE DOCUMENTED- WITH- OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. FEDERAL REGULATORY VIOLATIONS- AND SO IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME TO INDICATE THAT. AND AND MR RECHNITZ FOR THE RECORD- IS CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST THE OWNER OF THE LARGEST NUMBER OF NURSING HOME FACILITIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I MEAN WHAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO YOU BASED ON YOUR REVIEW. OF- THIS IS A CURRENT LICENSING SYSTEM. THAT IF AN APPLICANT HAS ALREADY HAS A RECORD OF HUNDREDS OF REGULATORY VIOLATIONS. THAT PERHAPS THEYSHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR SOME KIND OF A BLACK LIST IN TERMS OF BEING PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING ANY FURTHER NURSING HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF EXPERTISE BUT CERTAINLY THE CONCERNS YOU'RE RAISING OUR OUR VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE PROCESS WE HAD CONCERNS AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE LOOK AT TEN. TEN LICENSING APPLICATIONS AND WE LOOK AT THE FILES AS YOU SAID YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT DEFICIENCIES YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT CITATIONS BUT WHEN WE WHEN OUR STAFF LOOKED AT THAT THERE THOSE FILES WERE INCOMPLETE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE CITATIONS EVEN IF IT WAS TWO HUNDRED MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED. AND THE OTHER CONCERN WE HAD AND AGAIN I THINK YOUR BILL AND SOME OF THE STEPS PUBLIC HEALTH IS TAKING THEY NEED TO TAKE MORE STEPS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENT AND DEPENDABLE AND- THE FACTORS THAT IS THE FACT THAT IN AN INDIVIDUAL FACILITY OR AN OWNER WHO OWNS OF MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HAS HAD NUMEROUS CITATIONS. NUMEROUS DEFICIENCIESWHAT TYPE OF DEFICIENCIES ARE THEY THE IMMEDIATE YOU KNOW CONCERN AS FAR AS IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY WHERE HEALTH CARE SIR I MEAN IF PUBLIC HEALTH HAD TO GO OUT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO INVESTIGATE THAT'S WHAT WE WEREN'T SEEING WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT BACK IN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ISSUED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- BUT CLEARLY THOSE ARE WHERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD. BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY AND THAT EXPERTISE BUT IF I HAD A LOVED ONE I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING ONE OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS IN A FACILITY LIKE THAT I WOULD. NOT DO IT. THANK YOU FOR MUCH MR. IT WAS MURATSUCHI MISCARRY. CHECK CHECK HELLO HI AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON- I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE OFFER- MAYBE NOT AN ANSWER BUT A. A BILL THAT I WROTE IN THE GOT CHAPTER INTO LAW IN TWENTY NINETEEN RELATED TO THE LICENSURE- OF- HEALTH FACILITY FACILITIES AS YOU MENTIONED AND THIS BILL AB SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE I WOULD REQUIRE A LICENSEE OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AT LEAST NINETY DAYS. PRIOR TO FINALIZATION OF SALE TRANSFER OF OPERATION OR OTHER CHANGER TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO GIVE A WRITTEN NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE AND THE LICENSEE OR MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO ALL RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITY AND THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT CONTAIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PERSPECTIVE LICENSEE TRANSFEREE. ASSIGNEE LEE C. OR LICENSEE PARENT COMPANY OR MANAGEMENT COMPANY THE BILL WOULD IMPOSE A CIVIL PENALTY OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY ON A LICENSEE OF EACH DATE THAT THE NOTICE IS DELAYED THIS WAS IN PARTICULAR- RELATED TO. MANAGEMENT CHANGES AND FAMILIES NOT BEING NOTIFIED THE PATIENTS NOT BEING NOT NOTIFIED OR THE RESIDENTS OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOT BEING NOTIFIED AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SHARE IF THAT'S MADE ANY POSITIVE IMPACT TO DATE OR IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF. A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS RAISED AND HAVE BEEN RAISED AROUND THESE ISSUES AND WHETHER THIS BILL- CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN TERMS OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE FUTURE AND WHAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY- I KNOW THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW EXPERIENCED A YEAR OF CULVERDEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY IMPACTED BY THAT. AND I'D BE CURIOUS HOW THIS BILL- COULD BE PART OF A SOLUTION BASED APPROACH. TO THE CONCERNS ARE BEING RAISED NOW. WELL FIRST OF ALL MISS KOREA WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY FOLLOW UP AUDIT WORK- SUBSEQUENT TO ISSUING THIS REPORT IN MAY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOW WE DID I DID TALK ABOUT THE FOLLOW UP PROCESS AS FAR AS- PUBLIC HEALTH AND- ASHKHABAD. REPORTING TO US ON WITH THEIR PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THE RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS WE CERTAINLY TRACK ANY LEGISLATION- BECAUSE WE ASSIST MEMBERS IN ANY WAY WE CAN AS FAR AS- IF WE MAKE A LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS OFFICE TO ASSIST THEM. IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AND AUTHORING LEGISLATION IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR BILL- WAS ENACTED SUBSEQUENT TO THIS AUDIT SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT AND DO ANY AUDIT WORK SPECIFIC TO WHAT YOU WERE. REFERRING TO IN YOUR LEGISLATION BUT- FROM HEARING WHAT YOUR BILL DOES I THINK ABSOLUTELY IT'S MORE TRANSPARENCY IT'S INFORMING INDIVIDUALS WHO. EITHER LIVE IN THOSE HOMES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE. INFORMED ABOUT ALL THE OWNERSHIP OF THIS FACILITY IS CHANGING TO THIS OTHER INDIVIDUAL. AND THIS IS YOU KNOW THEIR HISTORY WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT AT THE VERY LEAST. IS PROVIDING MORE. INFORMATION TO. INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE FACILITIES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN MY OPINION THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE GONNA BE ADVOCATES FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO I WOULD PRESUME IT'S A IT'S A ABSOLUTELY A POSITIVE THING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY AUDIT WORK IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA SUBSEQUENT TO THIS AUDIT. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE MEMBERS WHO RIDE OBVIOUSLY MISS CORREOS HERE- MISSING YOUR CURRY MISTER KALRA- SO FOR INTERIM- INTERIM HEARING THIS IS IT THIS IS A GOOD TURN OUT WE'RE EXPECTING. OTHERS TO ARRIVE AS WELL SOME PLACES TO BE HERE IN PERSON EVEN ON MORE IN A MASS. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY IS THANK YOU THANK YOU I JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS A QUESTION FOR YOU MATAMATA DURING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR UPDATE. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON WHICH- OF THE PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGISLATION AND OVERSIGHT ARE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED. OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE- HI NOMIS RESEARCH IS WORKING ON A BILL DESERVES SOMETHING THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU WAS LIKE WOW THIS IS LIKE. THIS IS LIKE PRIORITY NUMBER ONE OR PRIORITY NUMBER TWO WELL I THINK- THANKFULLY THE MEMBERS YOURSELF AND OTHERS MISTER MERCER CHEESE BILL- MISTER KALRA BUILD THOSE ARE ALL WE ALL REALLY- I THINK EXCELLENT STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO IMPROVE. CALIFORNIA'S OVERSIGHT OF NURSING HOME FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE THEY WON OUTSTANDING RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD- WITH RESPECT TO LEGISLATION IT A COUPLE OF THEM. THE ONE RELATED TO THE RE INSPECTIONS TO TRY TO GET THE TIMELINE SIMILAR BECAUSE- IT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT THERE AND DO THE FEDERAL INSPECTION WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO EVERY FIFTEEN MONTHS. AND GET THAT STATE. ARE RE LICENSING RECERTIFICATION INSPECTION DONE BECAUSE AGAIN AS I SAID SOME OF THE STATE REQUIREMENTS ARE MORE STRINGENT. AND FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THOSE AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE SATISFYING REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL. CERTIFICATION FOR MEDICARE MEDICARE AT CETERA I MEAN MEDICARE- WOULD BE REALLY REALLY. IMPORTANT THE ONLY OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD LEGISLATIVELY REALLY WAS RELATED TO THE QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- BECAUSE AS WE MENTIONED IN THE AUDIT REPORT I BRIEFLY MENTIONED- A LOT OF FACILITIES. DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY HAD CITATIONS THEY HAVE DEFICIENCIES SO MAYBE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME RESTRUCTURING THERE. BECAUSE THOSE THAT DID RECEIVE THOSE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WE DID SEE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INDICATORS- AS FAR AS- AND THEIR QUALITY OF CARE SCORES COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE THEY GOT BETTER THEY DID IMPROVE SO THERE'S INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- DID. AFFECT CHANGE THEY THEY WERE WORTHWHILE SO- I THINK THE RE LICENSURE TO GETTING THOSE TWO TIME FRAMES TO MERA I MEAN ONE FIFTEEN MONTHS ONE THIRTY BUT- EASY ENOUGH- WOULD BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE IN REAL RE CERTIFICATION RELICENSING INSPECTIONS ARE ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE. SO THAT SEEMS REALLY SIMPLE REALLY RUDIMENTARY AND I GOT THE IMPRESSION FROM AN EARLIER COMMENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. THEYHAVE THE AUTHORITY DO THAT WILL ANSWER SO WHAT WE MENTION IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS A TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN LINE I REMEMBER LOOKING AT IT FOR YOU. AUTHORIZED DUAL INSPECTIONS WERE PUBLIC HEALTH CAN GO AND WE'RE GONNA INSPECTOR FOR THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WERE EXPECTED AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE STATE REQUIREMENTS. BUT WHEN WE DID THE OTTAWA PUBLIC HEALTH SAID IS. WELL THE TIME FRAMES ARE DIFFERENT IT'S HARD TO COORDINATE THIS ONE'S FIFTEEN MONTHS THIS ONE TWENTY FOUR STATES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. WE SAIDOKAY WELL WE'LL MAKE THE STATE THIRTY MONTHS AND THEN IT'S EASY ENOUGH. BECAUSE YOU DO THE FEDERAL AND YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE EVERY TWO YEARS. IT'S SERVICE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO YOU. SAMPLE THING TO CHANGE. SO IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION IT'S OF. A WILL OR OR IS THERE SOME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AS PREVENTING THEM FROM DOING THIS OFTENTIMES WILL SEE. BUT DEPARTMENTS HAVE AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING BUT THEY DON'T EXERCISE IT UNTIL THEIR IT'S EXPLICITLY TOLD BY THE LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SO I'M KIND UNDERSTRENGTH STAND. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE pJUST CHOOSING TO NOT FOR WHATEVER VARIETY REASONS OR ARE THEY WAITING FOR US TO SAY. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS. GO AHEAD PLEASE. IF YOU THE BUTTON THERE TOO I THINK THE RED LIGHT NEEDS TO BE ON FOR US IS IT I CAN'T SEE FROM RIGHT- SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT AND STAY LAW IN TERMS OF THE TIMING IF YOU INCREASED IT LIKE- THE STATE AUDITOR SAID FROM THE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS TO THE THIRTY MONTHS IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO SCHEDULE AND MORE EFFICIENT FOR THEM TO SCHEDULE THOSE. RELICENSING INSPECTIONS I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW- IN THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED AS PART OF THIS HEARING THERE SAYING THEY'RE CONDUCTING THE INSPECTIONS ON AVERAGE EVERY TWELVE MONTHS AND I THINK THAT'S AN INABILITY TO TRY TO CREATE SOME EFFICIENCIES BUT IF THE LAW WAS CHANGED FROM THE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF THE THIRTY MONTH THEY WOULD MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT FOR THEM. OKAY WELL. IT YES I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THIS AND- AND IT IT IT SEEMS SO SIMPLE- BUT YOU KNOW. REMEMBER WHERE WE ARE IT'S NOT ALWAYS NOTHING IS ALWAYS THAT SIMPLE SO APPARENTLY SO- FROM THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT MISS PETTICOAT THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I WAS OPPOSITE SPECIALLY INTERESTED IN IN ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW THAT THAT HAVE SWINE AND FOR CONSIDERATION AND YOUR YOUR COMMENTS WERE THOUGHTFUL. SO AS WE LOOK AT THE AT THE STAFFING ISSUES- DO YOU THINK THIS IS A BUDGETARY OR RESISTS. MAKE THE MECHANICS IN NOW HAVE WE HAVE WE AT SOME POINT REDUCE THE BUDGET TO ALLOW FOR IT DID NOT MAKE THIS. DOABLE FOR FOLKS OR FOR THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OR IS THIS JUST. IS THE PAY STRUCTURE SO SUCH THAT IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT PEOPLE. OR IS THERE NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO FILL THE POSITIONS. I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO FOR ONE THING THE JOB IS WELL FOR ONE THING. A LOT OF THESE POSITIONS REQUIRE THE PERSON TO BE A REGISTERED NURSE SO THERE MAY BE COMPETING- PRESSURES IN THE MARKET- BETTER JOB YOU KNOW BUT OF. DECISIONS PEOPLE WOULD RATHER TAKE THAN BEING A NURSE- SURVEYOR WITH THE DEPARTMENT- IN ADDITION IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY SOMETIMES STRUGGLE WITH MORALE TAPE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING IN AND YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOKING FOR DEFICIENCIES AT THESE FACILITIES AND IT'S NOT THE EASIEST. OF JOBS THE TIME WHAT THERE'S YOU KNOW PRESSURE WITH THE TIME LINES THE TURNAROUND IS REALLY FAST- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REALLY FAST THERE AND THEY'RE GOING YOU KNOW. EVERY TWO WEEKS OR SO GOING INTO A NEW- FACILITY TO CONDUCT THIS WORK SO THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY HAS BEEN THERE BUT THERE HAS BEEN THESE ISSUES WITH RETAINING YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THE RECRUITING THE STAFF AND THEN RETAINING THE STAFF. AND THE THAT- TIME THAT IT TAKES TO REALLY TRAIN SOMEONE ALSO DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE ONCE YOU DO HIRE SOMEBODY IT'S- ANOTHER TWELVE TO FOURTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THAT PERSON IS READY TO GO OUT ON THEIR OWN AND DO YOU- A SURVEY. OF THE LAST THING I WOULD MENTION IS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT A YEAR OR TWO AGO. THEY HAD BROUGHT IN A CONSULTANT TO HELP WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT I'VE RAISED TO- WHEN IT COMES TO EITHER RECRUITING PEOPLE INTO THE JOB OR OR RETAINING THEM. AND THAT SEEMS TO HAVE HELPED IT HELPED- GET THAT VACANCY RATE DOWN TO THREE POINT SIX- PERCENT BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THEY'RE NO LONGER WORKING WITH THAT. CONSULTANT SO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE PRACTICES ARE STILL IN PLACE IN PARTICULAR IN COMBINATION WITH COVETED- I I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE TO. TO ASK THEM ABOUT THAT AGAIN. THANK YOU I'M JUST CURIOUS- WE TALKED ABOUT THE SOME OF THESE INSPECTIONS ARE UNANNOUNCED SO OBVIOUSLY. I LIKE THAT- IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE'S COMING IN YOU KNOW THE IT'S IF YOU GOT GAS COMING USUALLY CLEAN UP A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW- AND PUT THE DISHES AWAY AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW- AND THINGS ARE JUST OPERATE NORTH HOUND HOW MUCH. HAS HAS THERE BEEN A CHANGE IT WAS AT ANY PART OF ANYTHING THAT YOU LOOKED ANYBODY LOOKED AT IN A NUMBER OF UNANNOUNCED VISITS. THAT ARE HAPPENING AS PART OF THE LICENSING PROCESS DOES ANYBODY KNOW THAT. WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE VISITS ARE UNANNOUNCED UNLESS IT'S- A COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION WHICH HAS TO BE INITIATED WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. SO I AM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE SURVEYS ASSOCIATED WITH APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS THE JUST THE REGULAR ONGOING LICENSE RENEWAL OR RE CERTIFICATION. THOSE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ANNOUNCED ON. AND IN ONE FINAL QUESTION ACTUALLY ANALYSIS QUESTION TO DPS BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT ONE DIRECTLY SO DID YOU DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR ANYTHING THIS FIGURE CARILLO. PLEASE THANK YOU AND I WANTED TO REALLY LIKE YOUR AUDIT HEARING HAND UP IT'S VERY CLEAR AND CONCISE- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW SO. SO MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL. TO BRINGING DATES AND TIME FRAMES TOGETHER. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT- WE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH THE FEDERAL. FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO LIST CHANGE THE TIME FRAME AND SO OVERALL. DISPARITY BETWEEN THE TWO. WE'RE DOING OUR- INSPECTIONS. THANKS I SAID I'LL I'LL LET K&lt;c.cyan&gt; ANSWER AS WELL I&lt;/c&gt; DON'T THINK SO AS SHE INDICATED THAT THE STATE LAW REQUIRES A TWENTY FOUR MONTHS THE FEDERAL IS FIFTEEN SO. THE SIMPLE FIXES TO IS ABOUT ABOUT MODIFY THAT THE STATE REQUIREMENT TO THIRTY MONTHS AND THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT'S BEEN PUT TOGETHER HERE IT. MAKES A PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE- AND IT'S SAD. THAT WE'VE HAD TO DO THIS WHEN I LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THOSE OLDER LEGISLATION. IT'S GREAT THAT WE DO LEGISLATION BUT GOSH DARN IT WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT IT RIGHT AND SO MANY TIMES WE SEE AS I'M GOING THROUGH BILLS EVEN. NON AND THIS COMMITTEE RATHER COMMITTEES WE MAKE SOME KIND OF. YOU KNOW STATEMENT GETS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE PAPER BUT I'LL BE DARNED IF IT'S NOT IMPLEMENTED WHAT GOOD IS IT. AND AS I GET OLDER I WANNA MAKE SURE. THAT YOU KNOW OUR HOUSE IN OUR- THANK. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK ON THE REALLY THINK THAT CUT. IS IT'S VERY WELL DONE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU AGAIN DISCOUNT I JUST I WANT TO SAY ONE THING BEFORE. WE MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND THAT'S THAT- I GUESS IT'S I GUESS IT'S DISAPPOINTING AS OF THE LEGISLATURE. YOU'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE- HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT. ABOUT A RECALL I'VE NOT HEARD OF ANY REQUEST HEY WOULD YOU CONSIDER DOING THIS SO THAT WE CAN COMPLY WITH THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION. THAT'S DISAPPOINTING. THAT'S A REALLY REASONABLE RECOMMENDATION. AND YET HERE WE ARE- AND- AND HE WOULD THINK THAT IN THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE. THE SAID THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY SAY WELL WE CAN'T FIX THIS WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR THAT WOULD BE NICE TO COORDINATE. REACH OUT WE CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW I COULD BE PART OF THAT COULD BE A COMMITTEE BILL YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT ISN'T ROCKET SCIENCE AND THAT'S DISAPPOINTING. THAT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING AND I SO ANYWAY. SO I THANK YOU BOTH ALL THE THROUGH ALL THREE OF YOU. AND I APPRECIATE THAT WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT. TIME THANK YOU. OUR SECOND PANEL I DEALS WITH THE QUALITY OF CARE CHALLENGES IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WE HAVE JOINING US. TODAY I BELIEVE IN PERSON- THE IS A KIM VALENTINE. IN. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION CONSUMER ATTORNEYS- DOCKED KARL STEINBERG WILL BE JOINING US VIA WEBEX- HE REPRESENTS A SOCIETY PROPOSED ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE- TONY CHEN COULD TELL THE STAFF ATTORNEY FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM- CASEY DUNHAM. THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY CALIFORNIA APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH VIA WEBEX. AND THEN SCOTT MONA- ALSO ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE WILL BE JOINED US VIA WEBEX SO. AS VALENTINE PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. MY NAME IS KEN VALENTINE AND I'M HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M A PLANNER CIVIL LITIGATOR WHO HAS PRACTICED IN THE AREA OF NEGLECT AND ABUSE OF ELDERS IN NURSING HOMES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE TODAY AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHY OWNERSHIP IN NURSING HOMES MATTER. SO AS IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE PRIMARY PROBLEM IN A NURSING HOME SIMPLY PUT IT IS UNDERSTAFFING. STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT INCREASE STOPPING LEADS TO HIGHER QUALITY OF CARE. BUT OBVIOUSLY IT TAKES MONEY TO INCREASED OFF. AND MOST NURSING HOMES ON PAPER RIGHT IN THE RIDE AND CRY POVERTY. THIS IS WHILE THE OWNERS ARE OFTEN MAKING MILLIONS AND SOMETIMES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 85% OF NURSING HOME REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY. SO HOW ARE WE CREATING BILLIONAIRES. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HEARD THAT NURSING HOMES ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE MORE. SINCE THE NURSING HOME. IS OFTEN THE LAST PLACE THAT MY CLIENTS ARE EVER GOING TO LIVE. I MAKE IT A POINT. TO LOOK UP THE HOME. IN WHICH THE OWNER OF THAT NURSING HOME LIVE. AND I STRUGGLE TO ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT NURSING HOMES ARE UNDERFUNDED WHEN THEIR OWNERS ARE LIVING IN HOMES THAT ARE SOMETIMES WORTH ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TRUE STORY. AND MY FIRM I SEE REPEAT DEFICIENCIES AND GOT CASES ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE OF THE CONDUCT THAT I AM COVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I HAVE STOPPED ASKING MYSELF THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S GOING TO BE FRAUD. I JUST ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION CAN I PROVE FRAUD IN THIS CASE HOW ARE THEY DOING AT THIS TIME. WHICH IS WHY I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OF YOU HERE THAT OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY I HAVE FELT LIKE I HAVE BEEN CARRYING ALL OF OUR FUTURES. AS WE AGE ON MY SHOULDERS AND I HAVE FELT LIKE IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONELY ROAD. TWENTY YEARS AGO I FELT LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WAS ACTUALLY A PART PARTNER AND TRYING TO HOLD NURSING HOMES ACCOUNTABLE. THE REALITY IS NOW WHEN THE CURRENT CLIENT COMES TO ME AND BAD CONDUCT HAS OCCURRED I DON'T EVEN TELL THEM TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BECAUSE IT IS POINTLESS. MY EXPERIENCE IS THE AGENCY HAS REDUCED ENFORCEMENT. OF QUALITY OF CARE BY ISSUING 35% LESS CITATIONS THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS WHILE THE PATIENTS AND NURSING HOMES ARE ABSOLUTELY GETTING SICKER AND SICKER EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THE QUALITY OF CARE HAS NOT IMPROVED. THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY AND THE PENALTIES OR THE ACCOUNTABILITY OUTCOMES FROM ONE NURSING HOME CHAIN WHEN COMPARED TO ANOTHER. AND TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT UNANNOUNCED VISITS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH OF YOU KNOW THAT THESE NURSING HOMES ABSOLUTELY NOW WHEN THOSE VISITS ARE GOING TO OCCUR. THEY HAVE CORPORATE INDIVIDUALS WHO TRACK WHEN THE SURVEYORS ARE GOING TO BE THERE THEY SAID AND THE BUILDINGS AND THEY WAIT. THEY ADD THE STAFFING HOURS FROM THOSE CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES INTO THEIR STOPPING TO MISLEAD THOSE SURVEYORS ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THE FACILITY SO DON'T BE FOOLED INTO THINKING THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE OMING. THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT DAY BUT THEY KNOW THE WINDOW AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY TRACKING IT. SO MOST NURSING HOMES AROUND BY LARGE CHAINS LIFE CARE CENTERS OF AMERICA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CHANGE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED BUILDINGS IN TWENTY EIGHT STATES WITH ANNUAL REVENUE OF TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND WITH FORTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. MANY OF THOSE FACILITIES ARE HERRON CALIFORNIA. LIFE CARE CENTERS OF AMERICA PAID THE LARGEST SETTLEMENT TO THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO RESOLVE FALSE CLAIMS ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL GOVERNMENT OVERBILLING. LIFE CARE CENTERS OF AMERICA WAS STARTED BY AND CONTINUES TO BE OWNED BY FORREST PRESTON NOW A BILLIONAIRE. ENSIGN SERVICES INC IS ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST CHAINS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED BUILDINGS AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THEY ARE FORTY FACILITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY ALSO PAID A SETTLEMENT OF FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO RESOLVE FALSE CLAIMS ACT ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO GOVERNMENT OVERBILLING. GENESIS HEALTHCARE IS ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST WITH FACILITIES AND TWENTY THREE STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THEY PAID FIFTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO RESOLVE SIX FALSE CLAIMS WHISTLEBLOWER LAWSUITS. SOON THE LARGEST OPERATOR IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE PROVIDENCE GROUPING AS THEY ARE BUYING OUT PLAN HEALTHCARE WHO JUST PAID FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RESOLVE FALSE CLAIMS ALLEGATIONS. PROVIDENCE GROUPING HAS GROWN FROM TWO. TO OVER A HUNDRED FACILITIES IN SIX YEARS. YES LOC CHAIN OPERATES EIGHTY ONE NURSING HOMES ARE NOW YOU KNOW IT'S CURRENTLY OUR LARGEST OPERATOR. WHO'D WHICH IS OWNED BY SONOMA WRECK NEXT A MILLIONAIRE WHO IS ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING HIS GOAL TO BECOME A BILLIONAIRE. HCR MANORCARE NOW OWNED BY PROMEDICA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST NURSING HOME CHAIN IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOUSE MULTIPLE BUILDINGS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT THESE ENTITIES HAVE IN COMMON IS HOW THEY PAY OR SIPHON MONEY OUT OF THE NURSING HOMES TO WHAT THEY CALL RELATED PARTIES. WHICH ARE BUSINESSES THAT THEY ALSO ON THOSE BUSINESSES RANGE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANIES PHARMACIES SUPPLY COMPANIES INTERIOR DECORATING FARMS. PHYSICAL THERAPY COMPANIES FINANCIAL CONSULTANTS INSURANCE COMPANIES A REAL ESTATE COMPANIES JUST TO NAME A FEW. SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS WORKS. MOST OF THESE CHAIN ORGANIZATIONS CREATE A WHOLLY OWNED. RELATED PARTY LIABILITY INSURANCE COMPANY. WITH THE SAME OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AND OWNERS OF THE OTHER RELATED ENTITIES. IN THIS REAL LIFE EXAMPLE ALL THE NURSING HOMES AND NOT CHANGE. YOUR PREMIUM OF ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS PER BUILDING. TO HAVE INSURANCE. AT THE END OF THAT YEAR THE WHOLLY OWNED INSURANCE COMPANY MAKES A PROFIT OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. PREMIUMS TO TRADITIONAL INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE OFTEN ONE THIRD TO ONE HALF THE SAME COST. IN THIS EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME IS PAYING A MILLION DOLLARS TO HAVE COVERAGE THAT LEAVES IT TO BEAR MEANING NO INSURANCE FOR THE FIRST SIX MILLION DOLLARS. NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CAPS. ON HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET AN ELDER ABUSE OR NEGLECT KIND. AND THE ONLY WAY A CASE COULD EVER GET PAST SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS IF THERE WAS A PUNITIVE DAMAGES CLAIM. BUT UNITIVE DAMAGES ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. SHOW THAT NURSING HOME IS PAYING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE HOBBIT ESSENTIALLY USELESS INSURANCE I'M NOT MILLION DOLLARS COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO PAY FOR STAFF. MANY OF THESE CHAINS HAVE VERY FAVORABLE REAL ESTATE LOANS. AGAIN THE REAL ESTATE OWNER IS A RELATED PARTY AND TO TEAM WITH OVERLAPPING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND ULTIMATE OWNERS. THE REAL ESTATE ENTITY THAN RENTS OR LEASES THE BUILDING TO YET ANOTHER RELATED ENTITY. OFTEN A SHELL COMPANY ALL OF THESE COULD CHANGE HAVE LAYERS AND LAYERS OF CORPORATE ENTITIES TO INSULATE THEM. RENTER LEASE PAYMENTS FOR BUILDINGS AND A CHAIN ARE OFTEN PAID AT SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE PER BED THEN COMPARABLE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SHELL ENTITY AGREES TO PAY THREE MILLION A YEAR FOR RENT OR LEASE. BUT THAT ENTITIES SUB LEASES THE BUILDING TO THE ACTUAL NURSING HOME FOR THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE HALF A MILLION DOLLAR PROFIT DIFFERENCE IS THEN UNTRACEABLE. THAT'S JUST ONE BUILDING. IMAGINE NOT PROFIT. FOR EACH BUILDING WITH AND THE CHAIN. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE SARIM OR EXAMPLE WAS A RELATED PARTY FINANCIAL CONSULTING COMPANY THAT WAS PAID SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER FACILITY TO REVIEW THEIR OWN FINANCIALS. THE RELATED PARTY FINANCIAL COMPANY EMPLOYED ONE PERSON. THAT ONE PERSON AS THE OWNER OF ALL OF THE NURSING HOMES CHOI PAID HIMSELF SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BUILDING. LIKE THAT MUCH MONEY AND TELL YOU TIMES IT BY ALL THE NEW BUILDINGS IN HIS PORTFOLIO IT TURNED OUT TO BE OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO REVIEW HIS OWN BOOKS. MANY OF THESE CORPORATE CHAINS ARE S. CORPORATIONS WHICH FINAL ALL THE MONEY TO THE ULTIMATE OWNER. THERE IS ZERO TRANSPARENCY OF THESE CHAINS AS A WHOLE. SERVE THE ONEROUS MAKING SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS ON THE REAL ESTATE WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES OR SUPPLY COMPANIES IT BENEFITS THEM. TO RUN THE BUILDINGS IN THE RIDE AND SHOW LOSSES SO THAT THEY CAN OFFSET THE PROFITS THAT THEY'RE MAKING ELSEWHERE. FOR TAX PURPOSES OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ONLY REVIEWS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ONE BUILDING IT DOESN'T SHOW IF MONEY IS SIPHONED OR MOVE FROM ONE ENTITY WITHIN THE OVERALL CHANGE TO ANOTHER WHICH COULD BE USED TO PAY FOR STAFFING. TO DATE RELATED PARTIES HAVE NEVER HOW TO REPORT FOR PROFITS SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY IS A REALLY GOOD START. TO TRY AND BRING SOME DEGREE OF ACCOUNTABILITY BY REQUIRING THESE RELATED PARTIES TO DISCLOSE PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS. IT'S A START. BUT THE ONLY REAL WAY TO ENSURE COMPLETE ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO REQUIRE COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY. NURSING HOMES ARE VERY GOOD AT MANIPULATING FINANCIAL DATA. FACILITIES HAVE BEEN REQUIRED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO SUBMIT ANNUAL COST REPORTS. IN MY CASES WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE LINE ITEMS ON THESE COST REPORTS. OPERATIONS CLAIM THAT THE REPORTS THAT THEY SUBMITTED ARE NOW WRONG. WELL WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT THEY ARE CONSISTENTLY MANIPULATED. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THIS INFORMATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND COULD BE OBTAINED WITH THE SIMPLE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST. HOWEVER UNDER OUR PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AND CMS INSTITUTED A POLICY IN WHICH THEY REFUSED TO RELEASE THESE REPORTS TO THE PUBLIC CLAIMING THEY WERE TRADE SECRETS WHY. BECAUSE THE NURSING HOME OWNERS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL PULL TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION PRIVATE AND AGAIN I ASK WHY IF THERE IS NOTHING TO HIDE WHY CHANGE THE PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. OTHER EXAMPLES OF HOW OFTEN OWNERS MANIPULATE DATA VIRTUALLY EVERY SINGLE NURSING HOME CHAIN HAS A RELATED PARTY ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY. THAT GETS PAID 526% OF THE NURSING HOMES GROSS PROFITS. EVEN IF THE FACILITY IS FINANCIALLY RUNNING IN THE RED. THESE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES SERVICES COMPANY ARE AGAIN OWNED BY THE SAME OWNERS. ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY EMPLOYS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HIRES. THE TOP EXECUTIVE OF THE OF THE BUILDING WHICH IS THE ADMINISTRATOR THEY DETERMINE HIS OR HER COMPETENCY IF HERE SHE KEEPS HER JOB THEY SET THE ADMINISTRATORS PAY STRUCTURE. MOSTLY ALWAYS INCENTIVIZED BY FINANCIAL TARGETS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY APPROVED ASSETS THE BUDGET THAT DICTATES THE DOLLARS ALLOWED FOR STAFFING THEY CREATE THE NURSING AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RIGHT THE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK POLICIES. SET THE PAY STRUCTURES FOR NURSING STAFF SET UP AND MANAGE THE BANK ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR NURSING HOME NEGOTIATE CONTRACTS COLLECT THE MONEY DECIDE HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT. AND TOLD THE NURSING HOME WHAT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEMS THEY WILL USE. THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COMPANY DOES NOT GIVE THE NURSING HOME THE OPTION OF THEIR YEARS THEY SIMPLY DICTATE WITHOUT REGARD FOR DEBT BUT THEY WILL BE PAID THE 526% OF FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT FEE. YET THEY CLAIM IN EVERY SINGLE CASE THAT THEY DO NOT OPERATE THE BUILDING. THESE ENTITIES ARE SIMPLY FORMED AS ANOTHER RELATED PARTY ENTITY BECAUSE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT IS BASED ON THE COST OF SERVICES. SO THE MORE MONEY THE NURSING HOME CAN SAY IT'S SPENDING EVEN OF GIVING THE MONEY TO THEMSELVES. AND INCREASES THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT. THE ONLY TRUE MEASURE TO DETERMINE OF NURSING HOME OWNERS HAVE MONEY TURN CREASE DROPPING AS TRANSPARENCY ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE ORGANIZATION TO THE OWNERS AND THE OPERATORS. COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY VERIFIABLE TRANSPARENCY AUDITED TRANSPARENCY. THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE OF A SINGLE NURSING HOMES PROFITABLE THE QUESTION SHOULD BE IF THE CHAIN AS A WHOLE IS PROFITABLE. AND IF THE CHAIN AS A WHOLE IS PROFITABLE THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THAT CHANGE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR UNDERSTAFFING INDIVIDUAL NURSING HOMES. THIS IS WHY WHO OWNS THE NURSING HOME MATTERS. WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU KNOW AS LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES COMPLETE FISCAL AUDITED TRANSPARENCY. LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE OFFICERS THE MANAGERS AND OWNERS OF ANY NURSING HOME OR CHANGE TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND ULTIMATELY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE STAFFING LEVELS IN THOSE BUILDINGS. AT PRESENT WE ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THE PROFITS OF THESE NURSING HOMES BUT WE DO NOT REQUIRE THEM TO BE ACCOUNTABLE OR EVEN KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT RELATES TO THE QUALITY OF CARE. CAPITALISM IS A GOOD THING. BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE BREEDING BILLIONAIRES AND A SYSTEM THAT IS PREDOMINANTLY FUNDED BY OUR STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS. WHAT I AM PERSONALLY ASKING FROM YOU IS TO PLEASE CONSIDER THE VERACITY OF HOW AND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR BILLIONAIRES BECAUSE IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR FRAUD. WE ARE LETTING THIS HAPPEN RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. I CAME HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH YOU BECAUSE AFTER TWENTY THREE YEARS I AM PETRIFIED TO GET OLD. THIS DISGRACEFUL BROKEN SYSTEM OF SENIOR LIVING CARE IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO CARE ABOUT. BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS VALENTINE. PAUSE FOR A SECOND THERE- OUR NEXT TO US BECAUSE- IS SAID DR- CARL STEINBERG ON VIA WEBEX SO PLEASE GO AHEAD DOCTOR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- MEMBERS. BUT I WANTED TO BE HERE WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. ON THIS VITALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC OF QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA'S NURSING FACILITY. I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE IN THE SYSTEM PANEL WITH SUCH LEADERS IN THE FIELD AND WITH CDPH UNLIKE OUR OTHER PANELISTS THOUGH I ACTUALLY FOR THE BULK OF MY PROFESSIONAL TIME ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE IN NURSING HOMES I'VE BEEN A NURSING HOME MEDICAL DIRECTOR AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I'M A PAST PRESIDENT OF CAL TCM AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF AMDA THE SOCIETY FOR POST ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE. IN THAT CAPACITY I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS FIRST HAND MANY OF THE PROBLEMS ARE NURSING HOMES AND EXPERIENCE I'VE ALSO BEEN PERENNIALLY AMAZED AT THE LOVE AND COMPASSION ARE SHARED BY OVERSEEING A STAFF WITH THE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS UNDER OUR CARE AND SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T GET DISCUSSED IN THESE MEETINGS. IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE THAT STAFFING ESPECIALLY NURSES AND CNA'S HAS BECOME SO MUCH MORE OF A CRISIS DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT IT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS I DON'T THINK THERE'S A SIMPLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK IT'S NAIVE TO BELIEVE THAT A FACILITIES ONLY RAISE WAGES THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE SOLVED. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HELP WE NEED A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GET PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE GET THEM INTO NURSING HOMES AND KEEP THEM THERE ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOSPITAL AT HOME AND SNIFF AT HOME PROGRAMS IS GREAT BUT WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO NEED NURSING HOMES. AND I WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK IN POST ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE NOT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE WHO OWN AND OPERATE THE FOR THE HOMES WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CHOOSE TO DEVOTE OUR CAREERS TO WORKING THERE DOCTORS NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHARMACISTS NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS AND ALL TEAM OF OTHERS. OUR MISSION IS ALL ABOUT PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY PERSON CENTRED COMPASSIONATE CARE TO OUR PATIENTS SO IT'S VERY. MUCH IN LINE WITH THE GOALS OF THIS SESSION. NURSING HOMES FACED. BECAUSE THERE POP. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWAREOF. THERE'S A LONG TERM CUSTODY OLD TRADITIONAL KIND OF MOSTLY MEDIC CAL POPULATION. WILL LIVE OUT THEIR DAYS IN OUR HOMES- AND THEN THE MOSTLY MEDICARE PART A POST ACUTE PATIENTS. WHO COME IN FOR REHAB AND SKILLED CARE AFTER A HOSPITALIZATION. SO THAT COMPLICATES THINGS A LITTLE BIT THAT LATTER POPULATION IS OFTEN HIGHLY MEDICALLY COMPLEX AND STILL QUITE ILL. LEADING SOME TO CALL TODAY'S NURSING HOMES MANY HOSPITALS. MANY OF OUR FACILITIES DO IV INFUSIONS COMPLEX WOUND CARE FREAKY OSTOMY CARE. VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT AND WE THINK YOU'RE REALLY SICK PEOPLE. YEP ONE ASPECT OF QUALITY THAT OFTEN GETS IGNORED IN NURSING HOMES IS THE QUALITY OF THE ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE. ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS HAVE ROBUST CREDENTIALING AND PROCTER AND PROCESSES. FOR PHYSICIAN PRIVILEGES. THE PATIENTS HAVE TO BE SEEN BY THEIR DOCTOR DAY. NURSING HOMES HAVE NOTHING OF THE SORT LIKE THOSE SAFEGUARDS THE DOCTOR ONLY HAS TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE EVERY THIRTY DAYS. THERE'S ZERO REQUIREMENT FOR CREDENTIALING AND PRIVILEGING THE FACILITY HAS TO EVACUATE COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR SPECIFIC MONITORING OR AUDITING OF OTHER PHYSICIANS PERFORMANCE. AND THOSE Q. A MEETINGS DON'T HAVE TO OCCUR ANYMORE THAT ONCE A QUARTER. THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS REALLY THE ONLY MECHANISM FOR ASSESSING PHYSICIAN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL MEDICAL CARE IN THE BUILDING. YET THE AVERAGE MEDICAL DIRECTOR POSITION CALLS FOR ONLY A FEW HOURS A MONTH. WHAT'S MORE SHOCKING THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT AT ALL BEYOND A VALID MEDICAL LICENSES FOR A DOCTOR TO BE A NURSING HOME MEDICAL DIRECTOR. SO SOME FACILITIES HIRE RETIRED PEDIATRICIANS ARE SURGEONS WHO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF GERIATRICS OR OF THE COMPLEX REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT NURSING HOMES OPERATED IN. WELL OTHER FACILITIES BAY HIGHER HOSPITALIST YOU CAN JUST DRIVE EMISSIONS AND FILL THE BEDS. CLEARLY THIS CREATES A HIGHER RISK OF QUALITY LAPSES AND WE HAVE SEEN UNFOLD TRAGICALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. MEDICAL DOCTORS CAN'T SINGLE HANDEDLY SOLVE THE QUALITY PROBLEMS OF NURSING HOMES BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT ENGAGED COMPETENT ETHICAL MEDICAL DIRECTOR CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SO PLEASE CONSIDER THAT. MAYBE SEVEN FORTY NINE WHICH I THANK YOU FOR PASSING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE THE FULL ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WITHOUT A SINGLE NO VOTE. WOULD REQUIRE ALL CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES THAT CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTORS WITHIN FIVE YEARS THIS BILL IS SITTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IT WAS NOT SIGNED WITH THE OTHER NURSING HOME BILLS LAST NIGHT AND I'M PUZZLED AND CONCERNED. IT HAD VIRTUALLY NO OPPOSITION I HOPE AND PRAY THAT BECOMES LAW SOON. YOU'LL HEAR A LOT TODAY ABOUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH LICENSING THE SURVEY PROCESS TRANSPARENCY ISSUES AND THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE IT'S CLEAR THAT STAFFING ISSUES EXTENT TO CDPH THROUGH. AND I KNOW IT'S HARD TO CLEAR A BACKLOG WHEN YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE. SERVICE RECORD AND WHILE I THINK THE SURVEY PROCESS IS. OVERLY ADVERSARIAL AND QUITE ENTRANCE. WE DO NEED OUR HOMES TO BECOME. BUT HIGHER FINES AT A LOWER FOR A THEM. UNLIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HERE LATELY IS NOT LIKELY TO IMPROVE QUALITY I'M SORRY TO SAY IT'S LIKE PUNISHING A POOR PERFORMING URBAN SCHOOL. BY REDUCING THEIR FUNDING THE PEOPLE OF SOFTWARE GOING TO BE THE ONES INSIDE THE SCHOOL. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT COUNTY CM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE STANDS READY TO COLLABORATE. AND ASSIST DOOZY ASK WITH ANY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE OR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS RECEIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO A DOCTOR STEINBERG AND I HOPE YOU CAN HANG WITH US WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER. OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFIED AND THEN I KNOW WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EVERYONE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER MISTER SHE COULD TELL. I REQUEST A NOON. PLEASE GO AHEAD AND TURN THIS ON. I THINK YOU'RE ON YOU'RE GETTING YEAH THANKS. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND THE- MEMBERS AND THE STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS HEARING. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR MY ABILITY TO COMMON TALK ON BEHALF OF. ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL TO LIVE IN A NURSING HOME AT SOME POINT THIS YEAR. AND THE FAMILIES OF OVER NINE THOUSAND RESIDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED. AWAY DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN IN NURSING HOMES. THE LARGEST. OCCASIONALLY EXPRESSES INTEREST IN ADDRESSING POOR CARE THAT MANY RESIDENTS RECEIVE. AUDITS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED REALLY GREAT AUDITS BILLS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SOME REALLY GREAT BILLS. AND HEARINGS ARE HELD BUT THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN WANTING. WELL WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST RESIDENT PROTECTIVE NURSING HOME POLICIES IN THE COUNTRY. THE ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN AND REMAINS TOTALLY MORE ABOUND. THE REPORTS BILLS IN HEARINGS TYPICALLY CALL OUT CDPH FAILURES GOING BACK FORTY YEARS. BUT IT'S PERFORMANCE NEVER REALLY IMPROVES. THERE ARE THREE FACTS THAT I THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC TO KNOW. ONE DPH HAS NO CONTROL OVER NURSING HOME QUALITY. DPH IS LACK OF CONTROL IS MOST PROFOUND ON THE ISSUE OF NURSING HOME OWNERSHIP. I KNOW IT'S ALREADY BEEN COVERED A LITTLE BIT BUT- THIS IS WHAT I GAP. IT SYSTEM FOR APPROVING A LICENSING THE PEOPLE WHO OWN AND OPERATE NURSING HOMES IS STRAIGHT BANANAS. CORROSIVE DPH INACTION HAS CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE OPERATORS WITH TERRIBLE TRACK WORKERS TRUCK TRACK RECORDS TAKEOVER NURSING HOMES WITHOUT APPROVAL. WHAT'S WORSE WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY DENIES A LICENSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. THE UNFIT OPERATOR CAN JUST KEEP OPERATING VARIOUS NURSING HOME SLUMLORDS OPERATE WITHOUT THE FAINTEST CONCERNED THAT EVEN THE MOST SHOCKING CASES OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. ARE GOING TO AFFECT THEIR BOTTOM LINES. HERE IS HOW CALIFORNIA'S LUDICROUSLY DISORDERED LICENSING SYSTEM WORKS. ONE TAKEOVER NURSING HOME TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN OVER WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR MAYBE DON'T. THREE TAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER REVENUE FOR YEARS WITHOUT A LICENSE. FOUR IF DPH EVENTUALLY TURNED YOU DOWN APPEAL. OR MAYBE DON'T. IF YOU APPEAL WAIT UNTIL THE EVE OF THE HEARING AND WITHDRAW YOUR APPEAL AND REAPPLY. SIX REPEAT THIS CYCLE ADD INFINITUM. I TOOK LATIN IN HIGH SCHOOL. MUCH OF THIS INANE PROCESS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN TO NEWTON TO RECENT NEWS STORIES FROM CALMATTERS AND L. A. S. OPERATING WITHOUT STATE APPROVAL WHAT WE CALL NURSING HOME SQUATTING IS NOT JUST A VIOLATION OF OUR STATE POLICY IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NORMS. IT INVITES SUFFERING AND DEATH. FACILITIES RUN BY SQUATTERS ARE AMONG THE WORST NURSING HOMES IN THE STATE. SQUATTERS HAVE STAFFING. MORE STAFF TURNOVER MORE STATE ISSUE DEFICIENCIES AND LOWER STAR RATINGS. AND SQUATTERS TAKE CARE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR AND OF COLOR. THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP FARCE IS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY ANALOGY. LET'S SAY ON MY WAY HERE I SOLD MY DRIVER'S LICENSE TO A PERSON WHO HAS A HORRIBLE HISTORY OF BAD DRIVING. AND THE DMV HAS NO SAY. THAT WOULD BE TROUBLING. NOW IMAGINE MY LICENSE WAS A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE AND I SOLD IT TO A PERSON WHO DRIVES A BUS FULL OF SCHOOL KIDS EVERY DAY. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALLOW LICENSEES TO SELL OR OUTSOURCE THEIR LICENSES. UNIMPEDED TO FOLKS WITH VERY BAD TRACK RECORDS. AND THEN WE PAY THEM TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO IT. THERE IS NOTHING MORE FOUNDATIONAL TO NURSING HOMES AND WHO OWNS AND OPERATES THEM AND THIS ON THIS MOST IMPORTANT CONCERN. DPH JUST TOTALLY FAILS TO GOVERN. THE SECOND IMPORTANT FACTOR KNOW ABOUT NURSING HOMES IS THAT THE MAJORITY THE VAST MAJORITY. ARE FOR PROFIT NURSING HOMES RUN BY FINANCE PEOPLE. THESE FOLKS COULD CARE LESS ABOUT NURSING OR RESIDENTS OR QUALITY OF CARE EXCEPT AS IT RELATES TO MONEY. THE PEOPLE AT THE CORPORATE LEADERSHIP LEVELS ARE LIKE MACHINES. PROGRAM TO FIND THE INCENTIVES AND WEAK POINTS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN EXPLOIT THEM. THERE ARE MYRIAD INCENTIVES AND WEAK POINTS TO EXPLOIT MOST OF WHICH HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH GOOD CARE. DPH HAS BEEN NO MATCH FOR THESE PROFIT MAXIMIZING MACHINES. THE LAST IMPORTANT FACTOR KNOWS THAT THERE ARE EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF ELDER ABUSE AND NEGLECT OCCURRING CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES. WEAK ENFORCEMENT ENABLES BAD CARE AND DPH ENFORCEMENT IS EXTRAORDINARILY WEAK. DPH STREET STANDARDS OF CARE AS GOALS RATHER THAN ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS. IN THE PAST THREE YEARS 97% THREE YEARS. OF THE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FEDERAL DEFICIENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED AGAINST CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES INCLUDING STUFF LIKE. THE ASSAULTS CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS ILLEGAL EVICTIONS FALLS BED SORES CHOKING. CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING YOU NAME IT. 97% OF THESE THIRTY THOUSAND WERE FOUND TO BE QUOTE NON HARMFUL. THIS WARPED SENSE OF RESIDENT INJURY LOS DEMONSTRATES A NURSING HOMES RATHER THAN THE RESIDENTS ARE THE CONSTITUENCY WHOSE INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED BY CDPH. I ALSO WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE THIS CAME UP IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT- IN TERMS OF RECERTIFICATION AS I WENT ON THE ON THE DPH WEBSITE AND I FOUND IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FIND IT. THE FINANCIAL YEAR. THERE WAS ONE. RECERTIFICATION AND OVER TWELVE HUNDRED NURSING HOMES IN THE WHOLE YEAR. ONE STATE RECERTIFICATION SURVEY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HAS GOES BACK TO THE EIGHTIES EXAMINE DPH AND CONCLUDED QUOTE. IT DOES NOT HAVE A WHOLE HEARTED COMMITMENT TO ENFORCEMENT OF ITS OWN REGULATIONS. AND QUOTE. THAT IS IT PRECISELY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. REAL ENFORCEMENT REQUIRES A WHOLE HEARTED COMMITMENT TO THE WELFARE OF RESIDENTS THEIR MISTREATMENT ISOLATION AND PAIN MUST BE VIEWED AS EMBARRASSING FAILURES. IT MUST BE HANDED. BUT INSTEAD OF EMPATHY AND COMMITMENT AND RESOLUTION DPH REMAINS HALF HEARTED AND COMPLETELY IMPERVIOUS TO CRITICISM. THE DEPARTMENT WEATHER'S ALL CUT DEPARTMENT WEATHER'S HEARINGS LIKE THIS NEWS REPORTS LITIGATION. AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS NONE OF IT MATTERS. DPH LEADERS HAVE ON ROLL THE WELCOME MA FOR BED NURSING HOME OPERATORS AND TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THE RESIDENTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS APPLICATION CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES ARE DOMINATED BY FOR PROFIT CHAINS THAT AT BEST ARE KNOWN FOR PUTTING PROFITS OVER CARE AND IT WORSE FOR ROUTINELY EXPOSING RESIDENTS TO ABUSE AND NEGLECT. ARE GOOD RULES MEANT TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR RESIDENTS ARE ROUTINELY VIOLATED BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW CONSEQUENCES. HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE WELL AB FIFTEEN OH TWO WOULD BE A VERY GOOD START. AB FIFTEEN OH TWO WOULD RAMP UP THE STATE'S SUITABILITY STANDARDS FOR OWNERSHIP AND FINALLY AND THE ZOMBIE NURSING HOME LICENSING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AB FIFTEEN OH TWO WOULD FORCE DPH BACK INTO ITS ROLE AS A LICENSING AGENCY. AND A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY. AND LET THE BAD OPERATORS KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS NO LONGER OPEN FOR THEIR KIND OF BUSINESS. I WOULD LIKE TO PUBLICLY EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION. TO MEMBER MERIT SUCI FOR CHAMPIONING LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS THIS PAST YEAR AND MANY OF MANY OTHER MEMBERS. THE PANDEMIC HAS OPENED OUR EYES TO ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH NURSING HOMES INTO THE TREMENDOUS SUFFERING RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO TAKE STRONG ACTIONS THAT WILL REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES. LET'S NOT SWEEP THESE TERRIBLE PROBLEMS UNDER THE RUG ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AT THIS VERY IMPORTANT HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR APPRECIATE THAT. WE WILL NOW GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON WE HAVE- TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CASSIE AND SCOTT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS PALACE AND GUESTS- MY NAME IS KATHY DONE ON MONDAY ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR PERCENT OR PROPER CARE QUALITY. PLEASE ALLOW ME TO FIRST- START BY EXPRESSING MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES TO THE MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSSES DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. DEMOCRATS PRESENTED UNIMAGINABLE CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. DROP THE RESPONSE THE DEPARTMENT ABSOLUTE FOCUS HAS BEEN ON SAVING LIVES I DEMóCRATAS THE WORK OF OUR STAFF WHO ACTED WITHOUT HESITANCY TO PROTECT RESIDENTS IN STOP AND GO NURSING FACILITY. AT THE SAME TIME EVERY LOST IS ONE TOO MANY AND WE MUST ALL REMAIN FULLY COMMITTED TO IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY MITIGATES. RISK FOR OUR VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN LONG TERM CARE. AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. AS WE PROGRESS BEYOND THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF THIS PANDEMIC AND PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WE MUST REVISIT OUR ACTIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PAST TWENTY MONTHS. WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST SEVERE REACTION TO CODED IN CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THAT THE STATE AND THE NATION WERE FACING AND ON PRETENDED. UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WITHIN THIRTY SIX HOURS OF THOSE FIRST EVENT THE DEPARTMENT SET UP MANDATORY DAILY REPORTING OF NEW COVET CASES. FOR ALL TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED. OOPS WE LOST OUR- AB URGENT NEEDS INCLUDING EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES AND STAFFING. HARTMAN IMMEDIATELY COORDINATED DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES TO FACILITIES BASED ON THOSE RECORDED NEEDS. MONITORING SYSTEM AND ANINTERNAL DASHBOARD USING RECORDED NEEDS INFORMATION COMBINED WITH RISK DATA THIS INFORMATION WITH THAT INFORMATION WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FACILITIES THAT WERE AT HIGH RISK FOR OUTBREAKS. AND REDUCE SHORTAGES. AND THAT'S TAKE PRO ACTIVE MEASURES TO ADDRESS THOSE RISK FACTORS. CENTER RESPONDED TO EVERY REPORT BY FACILITIES BY WAY OF TELEPHONE CALLS ARE ON SITE VISIT. WE ALSO ENGAGED FACILITIES YOUR WEEKLY WEBINARS TELECONFERENCES HAS YOUR UPDATED INFORMATION AND ADDRESS QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY FACILITIES. EXPERT PANELISTS IN AREAS OF TESTING VACCINE AND THERAPEUTICS AMONG OTHERS WERE ALSO INCLUDED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND PREVENT PRESENT NEW INFORMATION. EACH WEEK TO- DURING A GOLF FACILITY CALLED. DISSENTER PROACTIVELY DEPLOYED TEAMS OF INFECTION CONTROL EXPERTS TO FACILITIES THAT NOT ONLY HAD OUT ACTIVE OUTBREAK BUT THAT ALSO WERE IDENTIFIED. AS HIGH RISK MODERATE RISK AFTER OUTBREAK THESE TANKS CONDUCTED FOCUS ASSESSMENT TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY TO IMPROVE INFECTION CONTROL POLICIES PROTOCOLS AND REDUCE TRANSMISSION. BETWEEN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE C. H. C. Q. COMPLETED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND INFECTION CONTROL SURVEYS WITHIN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. THE SURVEYS NOT ONLY AFFECT FACILITIES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM STATE AND FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR STATE CARE BUT ALSO AFFORDED THE CENTER'S STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION AIMED AT MITIGATING THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AND SAFEGUARD TO HELP THE RESIDENTS AND STAFF. THE CENTER ALSO PARTICIPATED IN ON SITE AND VIRTUAL SURVEYS- FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES LICENSED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WITH A FOCUS AS WELL ON INFECTION CONTROL MEDICATION AND EDUCATION. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT TOOK ACTION TO APPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ENHANCED COMMUNICATION TO THE PUBLIC. ABOUT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES BY CREATING A CO THE NINETEEN WEBSITES HIGHLIGHT MITIGATION STRATEGIES SUCH AS INCREASING INFECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION AND FACILITIES. TO RELEASE SOME REAL TIME CHIEF DATA TO DISPLAY INTERACTIVE NATIONAL GRAFT ENSURE UP TO DATE FACILITY INFORMATION FOR FACILITIES CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC IN CONTINUING TODAY THE THUNDER CONTINUES TO CONDUCT INFECTION CONTROL MEDICATION SERVICE ON SITE. AND KILL NURSING FACILITIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CDC AND CDPH RECOMMENDS STATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS AND STAFF. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES WE FACED PRIOR TO AND DURING THE PANDEMIC AS WELL- AS SOME OF THE PRIOR- ANALYSTS HAVE MENTIONED IS A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS AND IN PARTICULAR LONG TERM CARE. THE STATE TOOK PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE STAFF NATIONWIDE TO ASSIST IN CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE. JUST TAP SHORTAGES I THINK THE POINT MORE THAN WHITE FIVE THOUSAND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDED DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. DURING THE PEAK OF THE HEALTHCARE CRISIS. WHILE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE ONGOING CRITICAL HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING. WITH AT THE AYE YOU CAST. THAT THE LADIES AND OTHERS TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO BOLSTER OUR RESOURCES AND ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. A SOLUTION TO THIS LONGSTANDING PROBLEM WILL REQUIRE A THOUGHTFUL ROBOT AND WELL DEVELOPED PLAN OVER THE SHORT AND LONG TERM. THE CENTER'S EFFORTS WERE AIDED BY CONTINUED INPUT FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS. ADVOCACY GROUPS AND THE PUBLIC. WHO INFORMED THE DEPARTMENT ON HOW OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AFFECTED RESIDENTS AND FAMILY. THEIR INSIGHTS ARE CRUCIAL TOWARDS ACHIEVING OUR SHARED GOAL OF PATIENT AND REGISTER RESIDENTS. SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE. ON WEEKLY CALLED AND WRITTEN TO. THE CENTER HAS COMMUNICATED THE BENEFITS OF VACCINATION AND CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE VISIBILITY STAFF RESIDENTS TO BECOME VACCINATED AS A BEST PRACTICE. TO KEEP THEM SAFE FROM SEVERE DISEASE. THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ALSO PROVIDED USEFUL RESOURCES TO FACILITY TO PROMOTE VACCINATION EFFORT. FROM A BROAD PERSPECTIVE LOOKING BACK THE ACTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ABILITY OPERATORS TAKE COLDER THAN ADVOCATE HAS TRANSFORMED OPERATIONS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BY WHICH WE INTERACT AS WE SHIFT OUR FOCUS TOWARDS THE FUTURE IT IS VITAL THAT WE INCORPORATE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM THE PAST. THE COSBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ELIMINATED THE NEED FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AS A TOOL TO HELP OVERSIGHT AGENCIES AND FACILITIES LIKE. TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO OUTBREAKS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE THE PROCESS AS NEW DATA EMERGES AND FOR FUTURE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND MONITORING OF COMPLIANCE TRENDS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE THE COLLECTIVE PASSION AND DEDICATION OF OUR INDUSTRY LEADERS ARE STAKEHOLDERS ARE ADVOCATE. ANALYST TODAY AND MY OWN TEAM. I AM PROUD TO SERVE ALONGSIDE YOU- AS WE AWAITED THERE AT THE IMPACT OF COKE AT NINETEEN AND AS WE APPROACH THE FUTURE. BEFORE I- INVITE MY ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR TO SPEAK- AND PROVIDE MORE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT- OUR CENTERS CURRENT AN ONGOING OBJECTIVES. I DO WANT TO BRIEFLY JUST TOUCH ON A FEW TOPICS MENTIONED BY SOME OF THE OP PREVIOUS PANELISTS- THE CITATION- TIMELINE THAT WAS MENTIONED BY. THE AUDITOR- OUR MOST RECENT- QUARTERLY METRICS DO INDICATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT THE CENTER IS 84% COMPLIANCE- FOR ISSUING OUR CITIZENS WITHIN THIRTY DAY TIMELINE- OUR IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY ARE MOST SEVERE- LEVEL ALLEGATIONS ARE WHETHER THEY BE COMPLAINTS OR A FACILITY REPORTED EVENT. WE ARE THOSE WITHIN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR TIME LINE- WITH REGARD TO HIRING AND RETAINING PURVEYOR THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE- IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WE HAVE BEEN- ADDRESSING AT THE- A FORMER PANELISTS MENTIONED WE DID ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WE HAD. GREAT SUCCESS WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THE WORK THAT WAS DONE THERE AND BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A LONG TERM INITIATIVES THAT WE NEED TO GIVE APPROPRIATE ATTENTION TO WE HAVE BEGUN BUILDING OUT- A RESOURCE UNIT OCT THE TYPICALLY FOCUSED ON ONGOING HIRING AND RETENTION EFFORTS WITHIN OUR CENTER- WITH REGARD TO RE LICENSING SURVEYS. AND THE- THE TIMELINE CYCLE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS OR PERSONS TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- AND AS WELL AS THE FIFTEEN POINT NINE ONE CYCLE FOR- RE CERTIFICATION SURVEY TRUSTKILL NURSING FACILITIES. NOTHING WOULD PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT FROM. COMPLETING OUR RELICENSING SURVEY CYCLE AT THE RECERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED OVER THE YEARS- WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE WOULD BE POTENTIALLY DELAYED- BY THREE MONTHS IF THAT WERE THE CASE. OR THE FEDERAL RECERTIFICATION CYCLE WOULD OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY ON THE TWELVE MONTH CYCLE- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND COMPLICATIONS OF THAT OF COURSE- THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE LESS EFFICIENT IN FACT THE FEDERAL PROCESS IS ANY OUR DATABASE- LIKE TRONIC- SURVEY PROCESS. WHERE THE STATE PROCESS CANNOT BE FOLDED INTO THAT ELECTRONIC INVESTIGATION AND SO THERE'S HAVE TO SIMULTANEOUS FUNCTIONS THAT OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT WE TO SHARE THE CONCERNS- ABOUT- COST REPORTING AND FINANCIAL DATA- BUT YOU WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS OUT OF THE SCOPE OF CDPH CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. AND IS- RESPONSIBILITY IN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SOME OF OUR OTHER- PARTNER DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT I- IN. GOT MY MEN ARE GET THE DIRECTOR TO- ACIDENTE ACTOR CHAD MORE INFORMATION TO BACK. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS COME UPON AND BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED I AM THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OKAY IN THE LICENSING IS DIVISION. WE'RE GONNA. OUR COURT. INCREASING BACKS RATES HAVE SLOWED TRANSMISSION. REDUCE SERVICE UNLESS BOTH RESIDENTS AND THE TIME IS NOW PART OF TO BEGIN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. AS WE LOOK BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC MANDATED WORK MORE. SEE SECURES BOUNCING THE RESUMPTION OF ROUTINE CYCLICAL WORK WITH RESPONSE FIRST YEAR LOCALIZED SEARCHES NUMBER REGENCY SITUATIONS SUCH AS FIRES. IN PUBLIC SAFETY PARKS ON ARTS. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A FEDERAL WORKER TENT WHICH WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE OUR ROUTINE FEDERAL WORK OVERTIME RESTORE PRE PANDEMIC OVERSIGHT. THIS RECOVERY PLAN IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. SAMPLE SOME PLEASE ON THE GO FULL THROTTLE SERVICE ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS OTHERS ARE SURVEYED ANNUALLY. TEACHING SECURITAS RECEPTIONIST RECTORY'S WITH ANY IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR FEDERAL AND STATE INFECTION CONTROL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ESPECIALLY WITH NEW CODE NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND SEARCHES. AND SEE CURES ACTUALLY ADDRESSING WORKFORCE NEEDS RESUMING OFFICER TRAINING CORPS NEW STAFF WHO HAS TURN OVER THIS LAST IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN MONTHS. WHAT WE PRIORITIZE A TRAINING OVER NURSING SO WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER. TRAINING FOR OTHER CRITICAL JUST WANTS TO ENSURE SAFETY ALL FACILITIES REQUIRES THAT WE- AND OVERSEE. THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT REGULATIONS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF CARE IN OUR STATE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN SETTINGS. AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO REVISE THIRTY DIFFERENT REGULATION PACKAGES. TO UPDATE OUR TELEPHONE THROUGH REGULATIONS. OF THE THREE TOTAL PACKAGES CCQ CURRENTLY HAS. TWELVE VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. OVER THE LAST TWENTY HOWEVER PROGRESS HAS BEEN DELAY DUE TO REDUCE OF THOSE POLICY STAFF TO COURT NINETEEN GUIDANCE FOR HELP TO PROVIDE.

SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IN FLORIDA BRANCH. ITS RESIDENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LIKE TO TURN TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS MISTER KALRA. I THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK VERY MUCH MATURE INTO TO ALL THE PANELISTS ARE FOR YOUR EXPERTISE- AND- DO YOU WANT TO THE PRESENT ORDER REFERRED SB THIRTY THREE TWENTY THREE I WANT TO. THANK THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE BILL ON OUR CHILDREN AND STAFF FOR FIVE YEARS TO WORK ON IT. THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK TO GET A BETWEEN TWENTY TO GET IT SIGNED INTO LAW. I THINK IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF- THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED TO I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY FOLKS AS SPOKEN READY- AND BE MORE URGENT. AND HOW WE RESPOND RESPOND AND REACT. TO WHAT WE KNOW- IS A CRISIS. AND I THINK THAT- AS ARCHER INDICATED WE GET. RIVER TOLD OFTENTIMES YOU'LL THERE'S A WE NEED TO DO. WE TRY TO ACT AS A- AS A LEGISLATURE AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE GET STALLED. FAR TOO OFTEN- AND SORT OF JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHEN I HAVE PER ROOMS. BALLANTINE- THANKS FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR PASS INTO- STATEMENT. WHERE DO YOU THINK I WANT ONE QUESTION IS REGARDING THE KIND OF THE- THE REGULATIONS AND WHERE THE STATE CAN IMPROVE- IN ITS REGULATORY DUTIES. TO REDUCE NURSING HOME KIND THE KIND OF REDUCE THE- NOT JUST THE LIABILITY BUT REALLY I THINK THAT YOU YOU POINTED TO THE FACT THAT OFTEN TIMES. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT- FOR. PATIENTS ARE OR FOR THOSE THAT ARE RESIDENTS TO ACTUALLY ACCESS JUSTICE- IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE THAT WOULD. HELP I HAVE YOUR BACK- THE OR PUT THE CURTAIN OR OR PULL BACK TO SOMEWHAT. ON WHAT'S HAPPENING- TO SO MANY BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SO MANY ANECDOTALLY I'VE HEARD SOME FROM SOMEBODY MY CONSTITUENTS ON ISSUES THAT OF CARD WHAT CAN YOU DO. REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE- IF YOU HAVE THE NAME DISPLAY A LOT OF THINGS WERE ONE OR TWO THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE THE MOST URGENT. SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IS THAT CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE REGULATIONS- THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING AND QUITE FRANKLY THAT DOESN'T OCCUR I'M I WAS I KNOW WE WHAT WE BALLING DRASTIC HERE TODAY I'M THE APPLICATION OF A PARTICULAR REGULATORY VIOLATION AND ONE FACILITY VERSUS ANOTHER FACILITY THE OUTCOMES ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT. I'M AND I MEAN QUITE FRANKLY. I NEVER MENTIONING THAT BEFORE WE CAME IN TODAY THOUGHT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF HOW THE- SADLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS NOT STOPPED UP I AND HOW THEIR HISTORY JUST CONTINUES TO REPEAT ITSELF IT'S NO WONDER. THAT THE FACILITY OWNERS AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN GAME NOT SYSTEM. AND BEER AS I MENTIONED AND MY REMARKS- WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING ELDER ABUSE LITIGATION THERE WERE QUITE A NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES AND QUIET A NUMBER OF CITATIONS. AND IT WAS WEDNESDAY WHEN SOMEONE DIED IN A NURSING HOME THERE SEEM TO BE AN ACTUAL REVIEW OR TO TRY AND DETERMINE IF THOUGHT DEATH WAS ACTUALLY RELATED. WHERE I WAS NOW WHAT I SAW THERE WAS THIS PROGRESSION AND WHAT I SAW WAS THIS VERY SHARP DROP OFF. WHERE WE WENT FROM CITING NURSING HOMES. CLASSE DOUBLE A. CITATIONS WE STOP DOING NOT AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY JUST BECAME SUB STANDARD DEFICIENCY SO THEY WERE THERE'S A SCOPE AND SEVERITY FOR EACH OF THE DEFICIENCIES AND THAT AND THEY BECAME A SUB STANDARD DEFICIENCY WHICH WAS PERHAPS A G. SUCH A DEFICIENCY BUT NO LONGER WEAR THOSE DEFICIENCIES- RISING TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY WERE CLASS A. R. W. CITATION. I ONLY KNOW MY LITTLE WORLD OF WHAT I DO ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS. BUT IT WAS VERY VERY VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THERE ARE STILL IT'S LIKE. BLACK AND WHITE WHAT IS NOW A G. DEFICIENCY USED TO BE AN ESSAY OR A DOUBLE A CITATION. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT PROCESS I FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS TO BE. AS A CIVIL LITIGATOR WHAT I FIND IS THAT PEOPLE ONLY SEEM TO CARE WHEN YOU HIT THEM AND THE ONE THING THEY CARE ABOUT WHICH IS MONEY. AND THAT'S A VERY SAD. STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT IT IS THE REALITY. SAYS CITING THE FOR DEFINING THESE FACILITIES DEFICIENT AND SITTING GIVING THEM ALL OF THE STATEMENTS OF DEFICIENCIES THEY DON'T EVEN THEY DON'T EVEN CARE AND QUITE HONESTLY ALL THEY TELL ME. WHEN I ASK THEM ABOUT THESE REPEAT DEFICIENCIES WHERE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY JUST KEEP GETTING CITED FOR THE SAME THING. ALL THEY TELL ME IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. QUITE FRANKLY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I'M NOT THE WHOLE PROCESS DOESN'T REALLY WORK AND THAT THEY DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE STATEMENTS OF DEFICIENCIES ANYWAY. AND THEY LITERALLY JUST BALK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND PAY IT NO NEVER MIND. NOW WHAT THEY WOULD CARE ABOUT IS IF THE STATE ONE IN AND LEVY A FINE AGAINST THEM. AND IF IT'S NOT ACTIVE THOUGHT PROCESS ACTUALLY WORK I THINK THAT THEN AT LEAST IT MIGHT CAUSE THEM TO HOP SOME LEVEL OF POLISH. SO I WHATEVER WE WERE DOING BEFORE WHERE WE WERE ISSUING MONEY- CITATION. NEEDS. TO BE RE IMPLEMENTED IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME. YOU CAN TELL CAN ZURCHER. I MEAN COMMON THE- YES I'D BE DELIGHTED TO- SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S IT BRINGS IN A LOT OF THE FEDERAL RULES AND LAWS BUT I THINK ONE THING WE COULD DO RIGHT AWAY IS TO. CHANGE THE PRESUMPTION FROM NO HARM ON A LOT OF THESE DEFICIENCIES AND CITATIONS TO A RESUMPTION OF HARM- ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES LIKE CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS- WHICH WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IF YOU'RE TAKING AN INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION THAT CHANGES THE WAY YOUR MIND WORKS AND IT'S AN APPROPRIATE I THINK THAT THAT'S DE FACTO HARMFUL AND IN THE DEPARTMENT NEVER TREATS THINGS THIS WAY- SO THAT'S WHAT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS. THAT YOU KNOW. MY STRONGEST FEELINGS IS THAT. THE BEST ENFORCEMENT GONNA COME FROM THE CONSUMERS THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE IN POWER TO DO THAT AND ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FORTY NINE WHICH- REINVIGORATED HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE FOURTEEN THIRTY B. IS A GREAT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION BUT GIVING CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO SELF AND FORCE A LOT OF THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS I THINK IS THAT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE AWESOME- AND GIVING. THEIR CONSUMERS MORE CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR MONEY IS SPENT IF THEY HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE THEY THEY PAY MORE MORE MONEY IS A LOT OF SO EVEN IF THEY HAVE A BAD EXPERIENCE. AND THEN. WE REALLY NEED TO END THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S PROBLEM WHERE WE'VE GOT ON. ON THE DEPARTMENT'S CONSUMER WEBSITE IS THE- WEBSITE WE INVITE CONSUMERS TO GO TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACILITY. YOU SEE. AN ENTITY THAT NO LONGER EXISTS AS A LICENSING HASN'T EXISTED FOR YEARS. AS THE LICENSEE AND THERE'S NO INDICATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AS TO WHO'S ACTUALLY CONTROLLING IT SO WE NEED TO. AND THAT COULDN'T GET INFORMATION. SO THAT THEY'RE NOT. THE FACILITY NO LONGER CONNECTED WITH BURNING A DEAD GUY WE'RE CONNECTED TO THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO LIVES THERE. ARE WHO'S WHO'S RUNNING THE PLACE. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FACILITIES BY CHANGE YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE. YOU SEE ONE FACILITY THERE'S NO CONNECTION THERE'S YOU REALLY HAVE TO SEARCH HARD. AND CONSUMERS CAN'T DO THIS TO FIND OUT WHAT OTHER FACILITIES ARE CONNECTED TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER MEMBERS RESPUESTA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I I'D LIKE TO- ASK YOU THAT- MS DUNHAM. HE BROUGHT TO THE HER. HEARING ROOM MONITOR IF NOT TO IS THERE ANYBODY THERE. I AM HERE OKAY THANK YOU. SO OF. IS DONE- AS THE ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. WHAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING OR OR WHAT I'M HEARING. IS A LENGTHY HISTORY THAT GOES BACK DECADES. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- FAILING TO CRACK DOWN ON BAD ACTORS THAT ARE GAMING. THE SYSTEM WHERE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE NOT GOING TO NURSING HOME CARE. I'D RATHER THEIR ENRICHING THE NURSING HOME OWNERS- AND IT SEEMS I MEAN I I'VE ONLY BEEN STARTED TO DELVE INTO. THESE NURSING HOME IN- INDUSTRY ISSUES. AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS- RELYING. ON MANY PEOPLE THAT TO HAVE BEEN WORKING COLLECTING CALIFORNIA. ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM- FOR MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. WE REPEATEDLY SEE THE SAME BAD ACTORS COMING FORWARD- CITED IN. LAWSUITS CITED IN- EVEN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH APPLICATION DENIALS. AND I AM. I DISCUSSED EARLIER. A LAWSUIT. THAT WAS FILED BY RESIDENTS IN THE READING AREA OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF RESIDENTS AT THE FORMER WINDSOR READING NURSING HOME FACILITY. AGAINST WHEN'S THE RIGHT READING SLOW MO RECHNITZ. YES MANAGEMENT IN OTHER RELATED PARTIES. AND THIS FACILITY. IS BEING IS OWNED. BY MR RECHNITZ. WHOSE APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE TO. OPERATE THIS FACILITY WAS DENIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN JULY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE YOU ARE YOU ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS- THIS DENIAL THE APPLICATION. YEAH. NO I'M NOT REFERRING TO THE LETTER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATED JULY EIGHTH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN SIGNED BY THERESA GOOD TERRACE CHIEF CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY NOTICE OF DENIAL APPLICATION. AND IT STAYS IN RELEVANT PART THAT THE CDPH DENIES YOUR APPLICATION FOR A LICENSE TO OPERATE. THE ABOVE REFERENCE FACILITY. AND IN DETERMINING AN APPLICANT'S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE RELEVANT HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE REGULATIONS THE CDPH REVIEWS THE COMPLIANCE HISTORY OF FACILITIES OWNED MANAGED OR OPERATED EITHER INDIRECTLY TO OR DIRECTLY BY THE APPLICANT. AND IT GOES ON TO CITE OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE REGULATORY VIOLATIONS AS THE BASIS FOR THE DENIAL OF THIS APPLICATION. AND YET. MR RECHNITZ CONTINUES TO. OPERATE THIS. NURSING HOME. UNDER THE- THE FORM THE LEGAL- FORMS OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER FROM WHICH MR RECHNITZ BOX BOB THE HOPE NURSING HOME FROM AS THE CURRENT LICENSEE HOW IS THIS. PROTECTING THE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AT. THIS FACILITY WHEN SOMEONE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE A NURSING HOME WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION DENIED. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION- I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT- STATUTE CURRENTLY GOVERNING SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOT ONLY OVERSIGHT BUT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS- MAY BE LACKING AND MAYBE. NOT PREVENTING CERTAIN SITUATIONS FROM OCCURRING- I WANTED TO SHARE THAT- CURRENT STATUTE DOES NOT PROHIBIT A AN EXISTING LICENSE FEE FROM ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT. THAT ALLOWS- MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY TO BE PERFORMED BY ANOTHER PARTY- IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY- CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP THAT WAS PENDING AT THE TIME. THE CURRENT AND- EXISTING- LICENSE HOLDER I. ENTERED INTO IN A- MANAGEMENT- TRANSFER AGREEMENT WHICH IS A TEMPORARY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CURRENT LICENSE IN THE PERSPECTIVE LICENSEE- OR THE APPLICANT- Q. YOU KNOW BEGIN OPERATING ON THEIR BEHALF WHILE THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATION IS UNDER CONSIDERATION. AT THE TIME THAT THE- IN THE EVENT THAT AN APPLICATION IS DENIED THE REQUIREMENT FOR OPERATIONS STILL REMAINS AND FALLS TO THAT PERMANENT LICENSE FEE THAT'S ON RECORD- BUT AGAIN- THERE IS NO RESTRICTION OR PROHIBITION- THAT THE- LICENSE HOLDER- NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN A BUSINESS AGREEMENT WITH- AN OPERATING PARTY OUR MANAGEMENT- ENTITY. TO CONTROL THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS IN THE BUILDING AND THAT IS THAT IS THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. SO. I APPRECIATE TO YOUR EXPLANATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH POSITION- I OF. AND FOCUSING ON YOUR USE OF THAT THE THAT THE- THE WORD TEMPORARY IN AND IN TERMS OF THE TEMPORARY OPERATION OF THE FACILITY WHILE THE- LICENSEE OF RECORD CONTINUES TO BE. NOT THE CURRENT OWNER OF THE NURSING HOME BUT THE PREVIOUS OWNER THE OWNER WHO SOLD THE PROPERTY AND PRESUMABLY HAS NO. CONTROL OVER THE CURRENT OPERATION OF THE NURSING HOME. FIRST OF ALL ON ON THE TEMPORARY ASPECT OF IT I MEAN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE BUT THAT ARE RAISED REGARDING WINDS WINDSOR- READING. THE DENIAL WAS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE ARE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT. ONE DOES TEMPORARY STOP BECOMING TEMPORARY IN TERMS OF ALLOWING. SOMEONE WHO APPLICATION WAS DENIED TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE FACILITY. SO THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THAT AGREEMENT- WAS DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE APPLICATION WAS UNDER REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT. SUBSEQUENT TO THE DENIAL THE LICENSEE WHO REMAINS THE ORIGINAL LICENSEE. HAS ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND IT'S NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO BY STATUTE OR REGULATION. I HAD TO ENTER INTO A BUSINESS AGREEMENT TO HAVE ANOTHER ENTITY OPERATE THE DAY TODAY- CARE AND DIRECT THE DAY TO DAY CARE IN THE FACILITY SO WHILE TEMPORARY AT THE TIME FOLLOWING THE DENIAL IT'S NO LONGER TEMPORARY THERE'S A PERMANENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES. OKAY SO YOU SEE YOU'VE YOU'VE NOTICED SEVERAL TIMES THAT. THE CURRENT STATUTE AND CURRENT REGULATIONS. DO NOT PROHIBIT THESE TYPE OF ARRANGEMENTS. WOULD YOU SAY THAT. THE CURRENT STATUTES- ARE IN NEED OF. REFORM. TO PROHIBIT THIS TYPE OF PRACTICE. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CERTAINLY YOU KNOW TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON ANY PROPOSALS AND PROVIDE SOME- CLARIFYING- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON ANYTHING THAT MAY BE PROPOSED- YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED I THINK THAT I WOULD BE- KIND OF BUSINESS STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS THE FACILITY HAS BEGUN ARE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER TIME- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE STATUTE TO LOOK AT- PERHAPS NEEDS AND WAYS. TO ADDRESS- MORE- CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT OCCUR. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO REVISE WHAT I BELIEVE IT OR ARE. LAWS THAT DESPERATELY NEED TO BE. REVISED AND CHANGED I I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO YOUR YOUR DENIAL LETTER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND I LETTER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN IN THIS LETTER YOU SPECIFICALLY SITE. THE BASIS FOR THE DENIAL OF MR RECHNITZ IS APPLICATION BEING HAS EXTENSIVE- HISTORY OF- FEDERAL AND STATE VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE PROVISIONS AND REGULATIONS. IF THE TIM IT IN MY MIND THAT BEGS THE QUESTION IF. MR RECHNITZ IS APPLICATION IS STUDENT DENIED IN THIS ONE INSTANCE THEN WHY WOULDN'T HE BE PERMANENTLY DENIED IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW AS A SEVERAL PANELISTS HAVE. CALLED FOR TODAY YOU KNOW CALL FOR THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHY WOULDN'T SOMEONE WITH A DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF VIOLATIONS NOT YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY BE REAPED. DENIED FOR FROM FROM ANY OWNERSHIP OF ANY- FEATURED NURSE NURSING HOME ACQUISITIONS. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION- DAY IN THE COMPLIANCE HISTORY REVIEW A CURRENT- KIND OF AN UP AND A POINT IN TIME- PROCESS MEANING THAT- YOU KNOW AS MONTHS AND YEARS HAVE COMPLIANCE HISTORY MAY CHANGE OPERATORS MAY I IMPROVING THEIR PERFORMANCE OPERATORS MAY DECLINE IN THEIR PERFORMANCE- AND THE STATUTE DOES NOT PROHIBIT. AN APPLICANT FROM- ESTIMATING FUTURE APPLICATIONS IF THEY WERE DENIED AS I BELIEVE MR TICKET TELL HAD MENTIONED- SO WHEN I NEW APPLICATION MAY COME IN AT THAT POINT IN TIME THAT WE'RE EVALUATING THAT APPLICATION THAT WE LOOK. PERFORMANCE AT THAT THAT POINT IN TIME AND THAT THE RECENT. RYCHEL PATH- SHOW IN IN CASES WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL MAY HAVE RECEIVED IN THE DIAL- THAT INDIVIDUAL DOES HAVE THE OPTION TO EITHER RE APPLY. FOR THAT BEING FACILITY LICENSURE OR POTENTIALLY COMMIT AN APPLICATION FOR A NEW FACILITY. OKAY SO WHEN I HEAR YOU SAYING IS BASICALLY YOUR- EVALUATING EACH APPLICATION ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND THAT YOU MAY. HOPE THAT- AB IS BAD ACTORS CAN SOMEHOW IMPROVE ON THE PERFORMANCE IS THAT CORRECT. I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE STATEMENT OR YOU KNOW ALL FACILITY OPERATORS INCLUDING AND I'M LIKE DEFINITELY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT IN GENERAL YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY AND SAFETY- ACROSS THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE AT. CONTINUE ON- BUT YES CERTAINLY WE WOULD WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE- ANY ACTION THE DEPARTMENT TAKE RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF AN OPERATOR. OKAY BUT BUT IN EVALUATING DID THE TALLY OF AN APPLICANT'S HISTORY AND RECORD WE HEARD TO. MS VALENTINE TESTIFYING HOW THEY'RE THERE ARE. THESE BAD ACTORS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE USING. THIS SHELL GAME OF RELATED PARTIES IN ORDER TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AT THE EXPENSE NOT ONLY OF TAXPAYERS BUT OF THE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WHO ARE BEING DENIED CARE WHO ARE BEING DENIED THE SPENDING FOR WHAT'S THOSE MEDIC HAL AND MEDICARE DOLLARS WERE INTENDED FOR. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. YOU KNOW AS TO WHETHER AN APPLICANT HAS A EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF ENRICHING THEMSELVES- AT THE EXPENSE OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. SO THE DEPARTMENT FOCUS IS ON THE DELIVERY OF CARE- WHICH IS YOU KNOW THAT THE QUALITY OF THE SAFETY AND THE CONSISTENCY- OF HEALTH CARE AT THE DELIVERED IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- OUR PROCESS WHILE WE DO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE AN INDICATOR OF AN OPERATOR'S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. AND FEDERAL LAW- WHERE THERE MAY BE NON COMPLIANCE WITH EIGHT EIGHT KOSTER BILLING ISSUE AT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION BUT AGAIN BY REVIEWING AUDITING AND TRACKING COST REPORT OR- OP PROFIT STATEMENT ONLINE OPERATOR IS OUTSIDE OF. OUR IMMEDIATE NEEDS THANK YOU ACCORDINGLY- SO AGAIN IF THERE WERE YOU KNOW KNOWN COMPLIANCE IS ISSUES WITH OTHER- STATE LAWS OR REGULATIONS. THAT ARE ENFORCED BY OTHER ENTITIES- IT CAN BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION- WITH REGARDS TO DEMONSTRATION OF THAT IN THE THAT OPERATORS ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- AGAIN PROFIT- PROFIT MARGINS OR COST REPORTING- OR BILLING PRACTICES IT'S NOT- DIRECTLY WITHIN OUR OVERSIGHT. OKAY HI I I'M I'M HOLDING IN MY HAND HERE A- AN ARTICLE THAT- SUMMARIZES A PROGRAM THAT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT NEWS- PROGRAM THAT WAS HEARD ON THE MORNING EDITION OF NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO- ENTITLED IN CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME OWNERS CAN OPERATE AFTER THEY THEY'RE DENIED A LICENSE. AND THEY- SITES. ANOTHER REPEAT BAD ACTOR THAT I'VE SEEN- HER NAME MENTIONED NUMEROUS TIMES IN THESE CASES THAT COME BEFORE US. CRYSTAL SOLAR SANO. AND THE ARTICLE INDICATES THAT- AND NUMEROUS LICENSE DENIAL LETTERS TO THEM AS SELLERS AUTO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SENATE BASED THAT DECISION ON A LONG RECORD OF VIOLATIONS AT HER NURSING HOMES. BUT- CAN GET YOU'RE YOU'RE INDICATING THAT DESPITE THAT LONG RECORD- YOU THE YEAR THE DEPARTMENT WOULD CONTINUE TO EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS- AS THEY CAN AND IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT THERE'S NO PROCESS- OR A STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT YOU PERMANENTLY- ESTABLISH A AUTOMATIC THE NILE OR AN APPLICATION- FOR A TOP RATED SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SHOULD THERE BE. A LAW OR REGULATION TO ESTABLISH REPEAT BAD ACTORS FROM FROM BEING ABLE TO- NURSING HOMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO- LOOK AT WAYS TO DETERMINE- PROVIDERS OR OPERATORS OR- AND THAT. BEING AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE OR BEING AN APPROPRIATE APPLICANTS- TO OPERATE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY- I WOULD CERTAINLY INVITE YOU KNOW OUR OUR PARTNERS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE STAKEHOLDERS AN ADVOCATE Q. YOU KNOW JOINING IN CONVERSATIONS AND EXPLORING WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND CERTAINLY. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH- ANY MEMBERS OFFICE THAT MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE COULD- EXPLORE WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE. OKAY WELL- I'LL I'LL WRAP UP WITH THIS THE AND THAT SAME NPR ARTICLE. GOES ON TO TALK ABOUT. HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- ALSO LOOKS I IN REVIEWING CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATIONS SIX TO DETERMINE WHETHER A APPLICANT IS OF REPUTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE CHARACTER. EVEN ARTICLE THE DEPARTMENT FOUND SELLERS ON A LACKING ACCORDING TO THE DENIAL LETTERS THE DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW QUOTE REVEALED THAT IN OR AROUND JULY OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT YOU SUBMITTED FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS TO OBTAIN YOUR NURSING HOME ADMINISTRATOR LICENSE SPECIFICALLY A FRAUDULENT COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT FROM TORO COLLEGE. AND ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE TOTAL COLLEGE TOUR UNIVERSITY CONFIRMED THAT SOLAR SANO HAD NOT RECEIVED A DEGREE FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONS SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT DESPITE. HAVING THIS REPEAT AFTER REPEAT APPLICANT AND- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OF CLEAR EXAMPLE OF SUBMITTING A FRAUDULENT COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO. TO YOU KNOW GIVE EACH ARE. AND SEPARATE APPLICATION FROM SOMEONE LIKE MS SOLAR SANO ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THAT IS CORRECT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO- ACCEPT AND REVIEW- USING OUR PROCESS ANY APPLICATION THAT CAME I FROM ANY ENTITY THAT THINKING- A LICENSE TO OPERATE A FACILITY. ANY CONSIDERATIONS LIKE THOSE THAT YOU MENTIONED WHICH I BELIEVE- IT'S STILL- BEING LOOKED INTO- THOSE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WOULD MAKE AN EVALUATING A POTENTIAL LICENSEE. MISTER CHAIRMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO CHANGING THESE LOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COMMISSIONER SU CHI- OTHER MEMBERS. OKAY MISS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY QUICKLOGIC- I UNDERSTAND DURING OUR CD PH AND WHEN WE ARE WHEN YOU WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT REVIEW THE- APPLICATIONS OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS REVIEWING PORTIONS OF THOSE APPLICATIONS. I MAYOR APPLIQUE. I APOLOGIZE APPLICATIONS FOR FACILITY LICENSURE FOR STILL NURSING FACILITIES IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY- CDPH CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY- OTHER DEPARTMENT WOULD NOT BE REVIEWING THAT APPLICATION- PORTION OF THE SUBSEQUENT IN A FIFTY ADDED APPLICATIONS LIKE- DOCUMENTS FOR ENROLLMENT AND- BOTH THE- DAY THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PROGRAM OR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS- THERE'S ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION THAT WE DO REVIEW AND THEN PARTNER WITH EITHER ON CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES OR- OUR OUR PARTNER DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR INVOLVEMENT AND- THE STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM BUT- FOR LICENSING PURPOSES- THAT REVIEW. IS WITH THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. THANK YOU FOR THE CUP CARE. APPRECIATE THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT I- TO- AND DIRECTED DPT PH I WANT TO THANK MISS VALENTINE MISTER CHECKED OUT FOR YOUR YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS AND- AND I THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU I THINK I'VE BEEN HAVE BEEN ANSWERED- THREE YOUR COMMENTS- CLEARLY. CLEARLY WE HAVE A CHALLENGES- THAT I THINK AND WE DO HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT COULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE QUALITY OUT THERE IT IS OFTEN THE WILL TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. MOVING FORWARD- I WOULD SAY AND IT ALSO THANK YOU TO DR STEINBERG- I UNDERSTAND YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT SOMETIMES OF FINANCIAL PENALTIES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST THING OUT THERE- I WOULD PROPOSE THAT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF SOLUTIONS ALONG WITH FINANCIAL PENALTIES. CAN CAN BE CAN BE POTENT MOTIVATORS- AND WE WANT TO WE WERE ACTUALLY IF PEOPLE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING AND DO THAT DO THIS WORK THERE ARE THERE ARE MECHANISMS FOR QUALITY- QUALITY PAYMENTS THAT FOR PROVIDING HIGHER QUALITY PERE. YEAH CARE SO THERE ARE THERE ARE CARROTS BUT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO STICK AND- AND IT'S IMPORTANT WEEK WE HAVE BOTH A AND R. AT OUR DISPOSAL- I WANNA I'M GONNA I'M GONNA ASK HIM. A CUT. D. TWO D. PH HERE I. YOUR YOUR WRIST. THAT AND THIS TO MISS- MISS DONNA. YOUR SPONSOR NOW WE ARE 83% RATE 83% RESPONSE TO IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY- THAT'S STILL PRETTY TROUBLING TO SEE QITE FRANKLY- THAT MEANS THAT OUT OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE SEVENTEEN PEOPLE. OUT THERE WOULDN'T GET THIS RESPONSE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS THAT IT WAS A RESPOND IN TWENTY FIVE HOURS PER TWENTY FIVE DAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS SO ALL WE KNOW IS IT IS NOT IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I'M SURE YOU HAVE THE DATA. THAT WOULD HELP US TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOU KNOW WIN WIN DID YOU FOLLOW UP WENT WITH WAS IT WAS IT DID YOU MISS IT BY A FEW HOURS DID YOU MISS IT BY A FEW DAYS- YOU KNOW 83% ISN'T ISN'T A GOOD NUMBER YOU KNOW I'M- I'LL GVE AN EXAMPLE I'M NOT COMPARING THIS BY ANY MEANS BUT- PUT IN PERSPECTIVE. IN MY DISTRICT. 83% OF MY- CONSTITUENTS HAVE. ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET. THAT MIGHT SOUND PRETTY GOOD THAT'S THE LOWEST IN THE STATE. SO THAT ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE YEARS BACK WHEN YOU WERE NINETY. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT KOBE ED AND KOPIN WE HAD A HEARING ON THAT. WE HAD SPECIFIC WE HAD ASKS- AND I DON'T YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE- AT THE WORK BEING DONE BANK WITH KOBE BUT WITH THAT WASN'T WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. THESE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. THIS COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING TWENTY FOURTEEN BEFORE MY TIME. ON THESE ISSUES AND SO WHILE PREPPING FOR THIS HEARING. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NOW SAYS THE BILL CREATING THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THEIR CONCERNS DAN. REGARDING LICENSING ISSUES AND WHETHER DPH WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO HILES ALLIES HOUSE LICENSING AGREEMENT AND CREDENTIALING. WHY ARE WE STILL HERE. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF IT. THESE ARE LONG STANDING ISSUES WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU- L. A. O. TESTIFIED TO THE MONEY WE THROW AT THIS PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH STAFFING WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS. THAT NEED TO BE DONE. YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH US WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ON UPON ON SOLUTIONS CORRECT. CORRECT MY EXPERIENCE. WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH SOME OF OUR AGENCIES IS THAT COMES A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE BILL NEEDS TO GET OUT OF ITS LAST COMMITTEE. SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR YOU FROM YOU AND YOUR DEPARTMENT IS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EARLY WELL THIS WHILE THIS BILL MISTER MURATSUCHI IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. I AM GOING TO JOIN AUTHOR WITH HIM. THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EARLY IN THIS HOUSE. NOT WHEN IT'S IN THE SENATE. WAITING TO GET OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS TO GO TO THE FLOOR. CAN WE GET THAT ASSURANCE FROM HIM. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY- WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC. AND TODAY'S CONVERSATION I THINK IS A GREAT PLATFORM FOR US TO START THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE SOME MEANING CALL- PROGRESS- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ABSOLUTELY WILL BE REACHING OUT I WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH MR RCG. OUR CONSULTANTS THIS IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ALL OF US- THE- VERY TROUBLED BY- SO SOME OF WHAT I HEARD FROM MR CHICKEN TELL ABOUT. HOW LICENSING CAN HAPPEN. IT'S AN APPLICANT. COULD CONTINUE TO BE AN COULD COULD BE AN OPERATOR EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE DENIED THE LICENSE IN THE CASE OF A OF THE WINDSOR READING THING NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE DENIED THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DENIED. AND HERE WE ARE FIVE YEARS LATER AND THAT. THAT APPLICANT IS THE OPERATOR. THE DE FACTO OPERATOR THERE'S NO QUESTION. I GUESS THAT THAT IS HAPPENING. THAT IS THE DE FACTO OPERATOR. HAVE THIS LAWSUIT NOT HAPPEN. AND HAD. IT HAD HAD THERE NOT BEEN DESK. IT FEELS LIKE THIS COULD GO ON IN PERPETUITY. IS THAT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION. WITHOUT THAT BACKSTORY THAT STATUTORY GUIDELINES BEING ADDRESSED- THERE THAT IS A POSSIBILITY- BASED ON THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE LAW. SO KNOWING KNOWING SEEING THESE THINGS HAPPEN. I GUESS THE BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT. WHY HASN'T THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COME FORWARDS RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT WHY DOES IT TAKE FOR THIS TO GET TO THIS POINT YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS EXIST WHY HAVEN'T HAVEN'T YOU COME TO OUR COMMUNITY- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND JUST SAID HEY WE COULD USE SOME ASSISTANCE HERE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT SOME CHALLENGES. WHY DO WE HAVE TO DISCOVER IT THIS WAY. WHY CAN'T WHAT WHERE IS THE PROACTIVE- PATIENT CENTERED. PUBLIC SAFETY APPROACH HERE WHERE IS THAT BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL IT RIGHT NOW WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DIG FOR THIS. THIS SHOULD COME TO US HEY WE GOT A PROBLEM WE GET PEOPLE THAT APPLY MULTIPLE TIMES FOR LICENSES. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET A LICENSE THEY'RE OPERATING THEM THEY'RE OPERATING THESE HOMES. AND YET. HERE WE ARE HERE WE SAID. WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR NEWS ARTICLES. IT TO PAY FOR PEOPLE TO DIE. AND WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE FOR PEOPLE CONTINUE OPERATE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AT A TIME. SO WHERE IS THE PROACTIVE APPROACH. FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THAT THE DEPARTMENT- FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEGUN DEVELOPING USING ITS EXISTING AUTHORITY A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP REGULATORY REGULATION PACKAGE- THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES- TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN UNDER CURRENT STATUTORY- GUIDELINES- UNFORTUNATELY DURING PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE- AND CRYPTOGRAPHY DOES REGULATION PACKAGES- WHAT DELAYED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT WE HAVE- BEEN- SPEAKING AND SHARING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ARE PREPARING. HERE TO READ THEM ON A SCHEDULING OF THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE REGULATION PACKAGES AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO MOVING OUT THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN- TAKING THE INITIATIVE I TO BE PROACTIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN- TO DRAFT- SOME OF THE ISSUES. AROUND THE FASCICULUS OPIC. WHEN I APPRECIATE AND WE LOOK FOR THAT I WILL JUST POINT OUT THAT TWO THOUSAND TO SIXTEEN TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. WAS A FORTY IS A FOR LIKE A FOUR YEAR PERIOD THERE- AND NOW YES WE HAVE HAD COATED BUT YOU KNOW. LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS IS A LONG STANDING PROBLEM. AND SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT IN FUTURE THAT WHEN YOU SEE PROBLEMS LIKE THIS OR CHALLENGES WERE NEED FOR SOMETHING REGULATORY OR ARE FOR LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE TO HELP WITH PROBLEMS THAT ARE CLEARLY RECOGNIZE WHEN ADVOCATES ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE ARE HAVING CHALLENGES. THAT WE CAN SEE A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH. ABSOLUTELY WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU- THANK YOU TO OUR WITNESSES AND- I'M SORRY WE GET. GIVEN THE WOUND UP HERE AND I I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT HI THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MISTER MURATSUCHI IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MYSELF- SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE. WE NEED. THE STATE TO SHOW THE SAME URGENCY. I AM PLEASED THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM OUR WITNESSES AND ARE AND THE AND THE CONCERNS FROM FROM FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS OF THIS- HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU. WITH THAT- I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD MOVE ONTO OUR FINAL PINE A PANEL. WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING A LITTLE LATE- AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL STICK WITH US HERE WE STILL WILL DO PUBLIC COMMENT WE MAY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO HAT. WE WILL ACCEPT PUBLIC COMMENT IN WRITING AS WELL SO BUT PLEASE COME FORWARD- TIFFANY TIFFANY WHITEN- MISTER CORNET CREEK CORNET- TIFFANY WHITENED- THIS WITH THE SEIU- MISTER CORNET AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH. HEALTH FACILITIES. AND THEN JOIN US- VIA WEBEX ADOPT DOCTOR ROBIN ROBIN STONE THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT RESEARCH CO DIRECTOR FOR LEADING H. L. T. S. S. CENTER- MISS WAITING TO SEE IF. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. TIFFANY WHITEN THEM. ANYONE WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND NURSING HOME WORKERS AND OVER TWO HUNDRED SMITH THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF INORMATION TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON QUALITY OF CARE AS IT RELATES TO STAFFING. APPROPRIATE INSUFFICIENT STAFFING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE LINKED STAFFING WITH BETTER RESIDENT CARE AND OUTCOMES LIKE LET'S FALLS RESULTING IN INJURIES LESS PRESSURE ULCERS AND BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY SOONER. SUFFICIENT STAFFING ALSO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN PREVENTING AND COMBATING PUBLIC NINETEEN. THE RECOMMENDED FEDERAL STANDARD FOR SUFFICIENT STAFFING IS AT LEAST FOUR POINT ONE HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY. HOWEVER THERE IS NO FEDERAL REQUIREMENT OTHER THAN SUFFICIENT STAFFING. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT THE ARE YOU DIRECT CARE CARE CARE GIVERS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT EXTREMELY HARD TO PASS A LAW TO INCREASE OUR CALIFORNIA STAFFING MINIMUM TO THREE POINT FIVE HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY. WITH TWO POINT FOUR OF THOSE BEING DELIVERED BY C. N. A.'S THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDE THE MOST HANDS ON DIE RIGHT CARE TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. HOWEVER ONE CONCERNING ELEMENT IS THAT 34% OF FACILITIES HAVE RECEIVE A STAFFING WAIVER FROM CDPH TO PROVIDE LESS THAN. THE TWO POINT FOUR HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY AT SEA AND I CARE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH NUMBER OF STAFFING WAIVERS BEING APPROVED. R. C. N. A.'S ARE OFTENTIMES RESPONSIBLE FOR THIRTEEN OR MORE RESIDENTS ON THE DAY SHIFT AND THIRTY OR MORE RESIDENTS DURING THE NIGHT SHIFT. IMAGINE TRYING TO ASSIST THIRTEEN RESIDENTS WITH GETTING OUT OF BED DRESSING AND BATHING AND HELPING FEED THEIR MAILS ALL NEARLY AT THE SAME TIME. AS WELL AS TRYING TO ATTEND TO THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS AND TRYING TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO ADHERE TO PERSON CENTERED CARE PRINCIPLES. EVEN THE BEST MULTI TASKER CANNOT ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THIS WHEN YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CARING FOR SO MANY RESIDENTS. THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT STAFFING HAVE LED TO C. N. A.'S HAVING ONE OF THE HIGHEST INJURY RATES OF ALL JOB CLASIFICATIONS. AND THE STRESS LEADS TO BURNOUT AND RAPID TURN STAFF TURNOVER IN THIS INDUSTRY. THE RESIDENTS SUFFER SINCE THEIR CARE NEEDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY MET. AND IF THEIR CARE GIVER IS INJURED OR LEAVE IT IS VERY UPSETTING TO TRANSITION TO ANOTHER NEW STAFF MEMBER SAYS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RESIDENTS. AND THE CARE GIVER IS TYPICALLY VERY VERY STRONG. OUR MEMBERS STRIVE TO PROVIDE THE UTMOST QUALITY PERSON CENTRED CARE. BUT THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES THAT PLAY A ROLE IN THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO DO SO. HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET OUT OF MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS NOT ONLY HARMS THE PRESIDENT BUSH DRAINS THE CARE PROVIDERS. IT'S BEYOND TIME TO REFORM THE ENTIRE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY AN INDUSTRY THAT RELIES ON TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT ARE NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY SPENT. AND CALIFORNIA OVER NINETY ONE PERCENT. OF ALL NURSING HOME RESIDENTS CARE REVENUES ARE FROM MEDIC HAL AND MEDICARE BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE PLANS. THIS MEANS THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS OVERWHELMINGLY FUNDED BY TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THIS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN MOST OTHER TYPES OF HEALTH CARE SETTINGS SINCE THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF NON GOVERNMENTAL COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE PAYERS. WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL GOING TO THIS INDUSTRY IT'S TIME FOR TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND BETTER WAGES AND TREATMENT FOR THESE CARE GIVERS. SMITH NOT ONLY RECEIVE STAFFING WAIVERS BUT THEY CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE MEDICARE ADD ON PAYMENTS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH NEW STEPPING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. FILE ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVEN THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR NURSING HOME PAYMENTS AND REQUIRES NURSING HOME MANAGEMENT. AND PROPERTY COMPANIES TO SUBMIT CERTIFIED FINANCIAL REPORTS. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF ITS MONEY IS SUPPORTING NURSING HOME RESIDENTS VERSUS HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT ON THE LIFESTYLE THE BILLIONAIRE NURSING HOME OWNERS. THESE BILLS ALONG WITH OTHER SIGNED YESTERDAY ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ADDRESS SOME MAJOR CONCERNS IN THIS AILING INDUSTRY BUT MUCH MORE IS NEEDED. IN ORDER TO GET QUALITY OUTCOMES WE MUST INVEST IN QUALITY STAFFING AD QUALITY OF CARE RATHER THAN PROFITS. IF WE DON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF RETENTION WE AT THE STATE ARE THROWING MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN. CARE GIVERS HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS SHOWN THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY DIGNITY AND PAID APPROPRIATELY. WE CAN DEBATE IF THERE'S TRULY A WORKER SHORTAGE OR IF INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST TIRED OF PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR OR MAYBE IT'S BOTH. WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE WHAT REMAINS TRUE IS THAT 86% OF CNA'S ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE MEDIAN ANNUAL EARNINGS OF TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 33% OF THESE CARE GIVERS RECEIVE SOMETHING SOME FORM OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. IT'S TIME TO TREAT OUR WORKERS BETTER AND IN DOING SO OUR RESIDENTS TO SNIFF WILL GET THE LEVEL IN THE QUALITY OF CARE THEY SO. RIGHTFULLY DESERVE. FINALLY GIVEN THAT CALIFORNIA SPENDS BILLIONS ON NURSING FACILITY SERVICES. AND THE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY EXPIRES NEXT YEAR. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. ON REFORMS THAT INVEST IN IN THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARE WORK FORCE. AND IMPROVE QUALITY PERFORMANCE. AS WELL AS MAINTAIN THE COST IN SOME FASHION WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REMARKS THAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY BY THE STATE AUDITOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND BE AND FOR BEING ABLE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CORNET. YEAH YES THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND OTHER MEMBERS OF I'M CRAIG CORNET THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CALF CAPITAL STATE'S LARGEST AND OLDEST NONPROFIT PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING THE LONG TERM CARE PROFESSION. WE REPRESENT MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR PERSONS EACH YEAR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND CARE GIVERS PROVIDE CARE TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS IN OUR FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME REMARKS TODAY ABOUT THAT APARTMENT A PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSING INSPECTION IT INSPECTION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO BEGIN BY JUST PAYING TRIBUTE HERE TO THE TIRELESS WORK OF IT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN SAID TODAY THE TIRELESS WORK OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OUR FACILITIES. THE STAFF THE R. ENDS THE LV ENDS THE C. N. A.'S THE ADMINISTRATORS- THE- THE GROUNDS KEEPERS THE DIET TO THE DIETARY STAFF WHO PROVIDED TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE TO OUR FRAIL AND ELDERLY RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE COBIT PANDEMIC. ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAD THE LOWEST MORTALITY RATE OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY- THE BEST REPEATED DECISION THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE WAS TO PRIORITIZE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND STAFF FOR THE COPA NINETEEN VACCINE AND THAT HAS- I THINK OUR FACILITY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE WELL ON THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST SOME OF THE HIGHEST STAFF AND RESIDENT. VACCINATION RATES IN THE COUNTRY OUR STAFF IS THE SECOND HIGHEST VACCINATED STAFF AT ABOUT 92% OF OUR STAFF VACCINATED ONLY BEHIND HAWAII AT THIS POINT. AS A RESULT OF OUR HIGH VACCINATION RATES. THE COBIT HAS WHO. BROUGH DENTAL FOR THE BUILDING NOT TOTALLY BUT AS AS OF YESTERDAY'S NUMBERS THAT WERE ELEVEN NEW CASES. AND TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY S. CASES OF COLD WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS SO I THINK WE DID IT THINGS ARE MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THEY WERE ON THAT STANDPOINT. I'M ALSO HAPPY TO REPORT THAT RESIDENTS WILL SOON BE RECEIVING THEIR COPA NINETY BOOSTER SHOTS. WHICH WILL EVEN PROVIDE MORE PROTECTION TO OUR PATIENTS AND STAFF. IN TERMS OF QUALITY- BEFORE I GO REAL VERY QUICKLY I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO THAT SNIFFS ARE RANKED IN CALIFORNIA ARE RANKED VERY HIGH NATIONALLY IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF ROADS FOR. CARE FOR RESIDENTS. CMS'S ANNUAL- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE NURSING HOME COMPARE DATA. SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD THE TOP NATIONAL RANKING. IN ELEVEN OF THE ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR MEASURES ANOTHER WHICH WE WERE EITHER FIRST OR SECOND IN THE NATION. IN ALMOST HALF OF THE OF THE QUALITY MEASURES TO CMS LOOKS AT. THESE INCLUDE SUCH IMPORTANT METRICS AS NURSING HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING PREVENTION OF INFECTIONS FLU AND PNEUMONIA VACCINATION RATES PREVENTING OF INTEREST FALLS. AND REDUCING THE USE OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS JUST MENTION SOME- ON LEGISLATION YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AND I WANTED JUST TO SAY WE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF THE BILLS THAT WENT THROUGH THIS YEAR WE WERE- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AB- SEVEN FORTY NINE THAT THAT. DOCTOR STEINBERG MENTIONED TO I REQUIRE MEDICAL DIRECTORS NURSING HOMES TO BE CERTIFIED WITHIN FIVE YEARS. WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE- TO COME TO POSITIONS ON SB SIX FIFTY- THE TRANSFORMATIONAL TRANSPARENCY BILL AND WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY WASN'T ADVANCEMENT WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR STERN IN THE COMMITTEES ON THAT. I WANT TO TURN THE LICENSING FEES NOW. AND I WOULD LIKE TO START DESPITE WITH THE GRAPHIC I BELIEVE HERE. IN FRONT OF YOU THIS THIS FIRST GRAPHIC FROM OUR POWER POINT SLIDE SHOWS THE NURSING HOME TO SEE A DRAMATIC INCREASE. IN LICENSING FEES OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS- IN THE FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES THE RATES OF BASICALLY TRIPLED. IN THE- SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN- SO NOW- AND THEN IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT'S BEEN ABOUT A FIVE TIMES HIGHER RATE FOR THE LICENSING FEES. AT SOME POINTS THESE THESE INCREASE LICENSING FEES WILL BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LICENSING FEES TO SUPPORT. THE LICENSURE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS UNFORTUNATELY- THAT THE FEES IN SOME CASES ARE. BEING PAID TO THE DEPARTMENT WHEN THESE POSITIONS ARE NOT BEING FILLED YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THAT- FROM SOME OF THE PRIOR- A TESTIMONY SOME OF THESE POSITIONS NOT BEING FILLED. IN OUR FACILITIES REALLY WANT TO SEE COMPLAINTS AND INCIDENTS INVESTIGATED AND CLOSED HAVING THESE THINGS LINGER FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IS NOT GOOD FOR THE PATIENTS AND THE RESIDENTS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE STAFF IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE FACILITIES. WE THE WAIT TIME FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND THE FOLLOW UP ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES. JUST TAKES IT JUST TAKES TOO LONG SO WE DO THINK IT MAKES THE SURVEYS LESS EFFECTIVE. AT ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS FOR PATIENT CARE SO WE- STRONGLY URGE THE THAT THE- THAT THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BEAT BE SPEEDED UP. SO THAT THESE THINGS DO NOT LINGER SO LONG. I WANT TO TURN NOW TO THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP ISSUE. THE COMMITTEES ASK US DISCUSS THE PROCESS FOR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. MY ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THERE IS ROOM FOR. SUBSTANTIAL HAS ISSUES WITH AN UNDERLINE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE THIS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED PROCESS. THE TIMELY EFFICIENT AND CONSISTENT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS. BENEFITS OUR RESIDENTS IT BENEFITS OUR LINE STAFF IT VOTER BENEFITS THE ADMINISTRATORS AND IT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE- JOINING ME TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE IS SOON BURNAM SOON WOULD JUST RAISE YOUR HAND. SHE IS THE DIRECTOR OF LICENSING AND REGULATORY SERVICES FOR INSIDE SERVICES SHE FLEW UP HERE TODAY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHE IS AN EXPERT ON LICENSING- CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP AND HAS ASSISTED AND FINE WITH CHANGES OF OWNERSHIP APPLICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES SHE IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE NOW OR LATER- AS YOU CONSIDER THESE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP ISSUES. I SPEAK REGULARLY WITH MY COUNTERPARTS IN THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CALIFORNIA'S CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP FOR LICENSE FOR NURSING HOMES TAKES LONGER THAN VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER STATE. WE NOW FIND THAT THE CHANGES TAKE IT YOU ALREADY HEARD FROM THE LA- ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS. INTO CONTRAST MOST OTHER STATES ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROCESS AND A MUCH MORE SPEEDY WAY AND THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS FOR THAT NOW I WANT TO. TURN TO THE TO THE GRAPHIC HERE THIS IS HARD TO READ BUT THIS IS A CHART THAT ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATES WHAT THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS IS LIKE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANTED JUST TO SHOW YOU CHOSE TO TABLE THAT ABOUT IT. THE COLOR CODING ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE SIX DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS. THIS SHOULD THE BLUE SHADES ARE ACTUALLY. UP DIVISIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHETHER THE CENTRALIZED APPLICATION BRANCH THE DISTRICT OFFICE. OR THE PROVIDER CERTIFICATION UNIT. THE GREEN REFLECTS THE MAX THE MEDICARE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRACTOR. THE PURPLE REFLECTS THE CMS OF- OF ROLE AND THEN THE ORANGE IS THE DH CS THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. EACH LINE SHOWS YOU JUST HOW COMPLICATED THIS IS BETWEEN THE LICENSING. AND THEN THE MEDICARE CERTIFICATION AND THE MEDIC HEALTH CERTIFICATION. THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES IN THIS PROCESS RIGHT NOW- THAT THAT THAT REALLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND WE TOTALLY AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOOK AT THIS LENGTHY AND CONVOLUTED PROCESS FOR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PUBLIC APPLICATIONS. WE ARE HOWEVER OPPOSED TO EIGHT TWO MISTER MAYOR CITIES BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. BECAUSE WE THINK IT PROPOSES AN OVERARCHING AND PUNITIVE APPROACH THE PROCESS RATHER THAN ADDRESSING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THE PROCESS. AS LONG AS THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR IT THE OWNERSHIP TAKES YEARS AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS. IT'S CRITICAL THAT THEY HAD SOME SORT OF INTIMATE INNER A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE WHILE THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE PENDING IF THE APPLICATIONS COULD BE PROCESSED IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE IN THE SITUATION- NOTHING PENALTIES FINES AND BAN ON ADMISSIONS FOR FACILITIES. THAT HAVE TO UTILIZE IN OUR MANAGERS JUST GOES TOO FAR- I WANT ALSO POINT OUT THE LAST ROW I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SEE IT ON YOUR GRAPHIC BUT YOU'VE GOT A HARD COPY I BELIEVE- THERE'S PROCESS CHANGES THAT WE THINK. CAN BE MADE HERE THAT WE THINK WOULD ACTUALLY. GET VERY MUCH OF SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE HEARD. A MORE STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS INCLUDING A MORE CENTRALIZED APPROACH. WITHIN CD PH THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION DIVISION AND THE DISTRICT OFFICES. ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR THE CDPH STAFF. ALSO WHEN CONSIDERING POTENTIAL DISQUALIFICATION FOR OWNERSHIP. DUE TO AN EDITOR AND ENTITIES HISTORY OF CITATIONS IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT SCALE. A COMPANY THAT OPERATES FIVE OR LESS FACILITIES SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME CRITERIA AS A FIX AS A COMPANY THAT OPERATES FORTY OR FIFTY. UP AND TAKEN OVER. THAT HIS AND THAT THAT HAS A HISTORY OF SPECIALLY ONE THAT HAS A HISTORY. OF TAKING OVER NURSING HOMES AND SUCCESSFULLY IMPROVING THE CARE OF THE RESIDENTS. OF IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE CD PH SHOULD CONSIDER A FAST TRACK PROCESS. FOR COMPANIES THAT APPLIED FOR A CHANGE IN THE LAST YEAR HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. THEY START OVER ALL OVER WITH EACH OF THESE APPLICATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAS ALL THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE PARTICULAR COMPANY. AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW MORE QUICKLY. FOR THOSE BUILDINGS IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR EXPERIENCING OTHER IMMEDIATE REGULATORY ISSUES. A FAST TRACK. PROCESS QUé SHOULD BE UTILIZED. WHICH WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS THE STAFF AND THE FACILITY FOR NEW OWNER TO TAKE OVER QUICKLY. I WANT TO SAY THAT MAKE TREAT EVERYONE THE HERE'S THIS TO. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR A FACILITY TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A NEW META CAL RATE YOUR RATES ARE BASED ON FEE. FOR SERVICE AND YOU CAN'T ESTABLISH A NEW RATE EVEN THE FIRST THAT PUTTING IN MORE MONEY IT WANTS TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SERVICES THEY CAN'T DO THAT UNTIL THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP IS COMPLETE. FOR APPLICATIONS THE LAST MONTHS TO YEARS THESE FACILITIES ARE STILL RECEIVING A MEDIC CAL RAPE WHICH IS AYBE THREE YEARS OLD AND DOESN'T REFLECT THE COST OF WHAT THEY'RE- THEY'RE ACTUALLY INCURRING. FURTHER NURSING FACILITY SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED DOUBLE FEES. DUTY EXTENDED TO IT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS. APPLICANTS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP FEE WHEN FIRST APPLYING. A RENEWAL FEE OF FOR OUR FACILITY THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW. IF THE PROCESS TAKES LONGER THAN A YEAR. THEN THE BUYER HAS TO PAY ANOTHER OWNERSHIP OUR ANNUAL LICENSING FEES. WE KNOW THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF RESIDENTS STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY. FOR FACILITY TO CHANGE OWNERSHIP ESPECIALLY FOR A STRUGGLING BUILDING. THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT. AND FOR AN OPERATOR WHO WISHES TO RETIRE AND MOVE THE BALL AND WE HEAR ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROCESS IS NOT SET UP WELL TO. FACILITATE ANY OF THAT. SO OUT WE DO NOT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO SHARE ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIRMAN WOULD AND- SOME WINDERMERE SEARCHING THE COMMITTEE. UP ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES OVER THE COMING MONTHS- AND BEFORE I LEAVE I DO WANT TO MENTION ONE LAST COMMENT. ABOUT THE SEVERE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW UP WE'RE IN A STAFFING CRISIS PURE AND SIMPLE- PRIOR TO THE CODE PANDEMIC. HOTSPOT HAD ALREADY ESTIMATED THAT- WE WOULD HAVE TO SHORTAGE OF THIRTY THOUSAND NURSE ASSISTANTS BY THE YEAR OF THIRD OF TWENTY THIRTY. UP DEPARTMENT HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES JUST RETHINK CAME OUT AND REVISED THAT TO FORTY FIVE THOUSAND- CNA'S LV ENDS AND OURENSE THEY'RE BURNED OUT EVERYBODY'S REALLY BURNED OUT RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE A GREATER DEMAND. WITH THE RISING AGING POPULATION AND WE NEED MORE- NURSING PROGRAMS AND FOR FACULTY TO PAIR. UP MORE NURSES AND CAREGIVERS FOR THE LONG TERM- IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LET'S. PRIORITIZE THE STAFFING NEEDS FOR FACILITIES. FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE RAISED SALARIES PAID RETENTION BONUSES OF UP PAID SIGNING BONUSES AND- THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE BUT THAT THAT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE ALSO NEED. MORE FLEX ESTABAN FLEXIBILITY AND PAY FOR PAYING FACILITIES. THE FULL MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEIR LABOR COSTS. AND QUICKLY UTILIZING FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- TO BUILD A CNA WORK FORCE- THAT STILL HAS NOT. STARTED EXPANDING IT FOR THE YEAH YEAH. WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT- GET GOING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS BUT YOU CAN HANG WITH US UNTIL WE HEAR. FROM OUR FINAL PANELIST APPRECIATE THE- OUR FINAL PANEL- DOCTOR UP IN STONE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I KNOW YOU'RE WITH US VIA WEBEX. YES I'M WITH YOU WEBEX AND I'M IN REHOBOTH BEACH DELAWARE. EVEN THOUGH I ACTUALLY HAVE MY HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON DC I WANT TO THANK THE- CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY ELSE IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN ON ON AYE OPENING- OUR- OWN IT DOWN FOR ME TO LISTEN STATE THROUGH THIS HOLD. NINE YARDS AND TO TRY TO WRAP IT UP- I AM HERE TODAY REALLY REPRESENTING. MY GROUP WHICH IS THE LONG TERM AND SO RESEARCH ON- WITHIN LEADING AGE WE IS THE NAY. SALES FOR NOT FOR. AGING SERVER PRO INCLUDING NURSING ASSISTED LIVING HOME CARE HOME HEALTH AND HOSPICE AND MY- STATE AFFILIATE CALIFORNIA LEADING H- BEFORE I JUST STARTED VERY QUICKLY ON WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY I. I WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE FORTY FIVE YEARS OF WORK IN THIS BILL- I. WHEN I WAS A MY TO AND I'M SEVENTY ONE NOW. AND IT SEEMS TO ME TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AS THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR AGING IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AS A DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND SERVICES AS A DOCTORAL. AT CAL. I HAVE MY DOCTORATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH FROM UC BERKELEY AND WORKED FOR MANY YEARS AT UCSF. I REMEMBER TWO OR THREE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION STARTUP OUT THE SAME ISSUE.AND NOW I'M SEVENTY ONE AND I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF PERHAPS HAVING TO USE ONE OF THESE SERVICES. I'M I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. FOR US TO HAVE THE ULTIMATE IN TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE NURSING HOME SECTOR. I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE CAN GET RID OF BAD APPLES AND I HOPE THAT WE DO. BUT THAT WILL NOT IMPROVE THE MEDIOCRITY OF MOST OF OUR NURSING HOMES IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. WHICH IS THAT WE NEED TO INVEST. IN OUR HUMAN CAPITAL. AND THE STATE NEEDS TO PAY SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE HER DOCTOR STEINBERG TALK ABOUT ONE ASPECT OF THIS WHICH IS THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS AND SOME OF THE CLINICIANS THAT NEED TO BE DOING BETTER MEDICAL CARE IN A NURSING HOMES PARTICULARLY ON THE POST ACUTE SIDE. BUT I WANT TO TURN MY CHECK MY ATTENTION. IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. TO THE DIRECT CARE. OCCUPATIONS AND YOU HEARD OUR RESPONSE PERSON FROM THE S. UNITE YOU. TALKING ABOUT THIS. BUT THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT DO 6280% OF ALL THE CARE WE CAN O BACK. ONE ONE SIDE- THEY DO ALL OF THAT ALL. OF THE CHAIR WELL AS A HANDS ON CARE SOME. FOR HIGH. IN NURSE HOMES. SO WE MIGHT PAY ATTENTION TO THIS POPULATION WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS. THEY'RE NOT BUT FIRST. THEY'RE NOT MATE THEY'RE NOT BUCKLERS. THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING PERSON JUST PERSONAL CARE. THEY ARE MOSTLY FEMALE THEY ARE LOW INCOME THERE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THEY ARE PRIMARILY. IN A LARGE PART IN PARTICULAR IN CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS. CAN TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SAY IMMIGRATION STATUS YOU KNOW A LARGE PROPORTION 27% OF THIS POPULATION ARE FOREIGN BORN AND A LARGE PROPORTION OF THEM ARE NON WHITE THIS IS HEALTH DISPARITIES AT ITS ALTERNATE AND WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT THIS AND AN EXTREMELY DIFFERENT WAY THESE ARE NOT WHAT WAGE WORKERS. THESE ARE CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE BEING PAID LOW WAGES AND WE NEED TO TURN THAT ON ITS HEAD SO IF I CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU- RESULTS FROM A MODELING EFFORT THAT WE DID IT FOR THE UNITED STATES CALLED MAKING CARE WORK HEY. AND WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE EFFECTS WOULD BE ACTUALLY RAISING THE FRONTLINE CARE PROFESSIONAL WAGES TO A LIVABLE WAGE. NOT JUST A MINIMUM WAGE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN WASHINGTON DC WHERE I LIVE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO LEVEL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A LIVABLE WAGE HERE AND IF YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT UP TO SHOW A COUPLE OF THE ROOMS. THREE QUARTERS THE DIRECT CARE WORK WOULD HIGHER WHEN THAT TODAY TALKING ABOUT ON AVERAGE OF A FIFTH OVER LITTLE OVER. PER AVERAGE WAGE GAINS. YOU WORST SHORT. WE WENT THREE AND THOUSAND NEW DIRECT CARE JOBS AND A NINE POINT 1% EMPLOYMENT BOOST IN OUR ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES. A FAIRLY MODEST PRICE TAG FOR THE WHOLE U. S. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE NUMBERS FOR CALIFORNIA IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. NINE POINT FOUR BILLION PRICE TAG COMPARED WITH THE FOUR HUNDRED BILLION TODAY THAT WE'RE SPENDING IN THIS FIELD. AND WE ALSO HAVE TURNOVER REDUCTIONS- WITH A FIVE BILLION PRODUCTIVITY INCREASE THAT WOULD OFFSET THE COSTS OF THIS HIGHER K. AROUND LIVABLE WAGE. THE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS. I ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH ADDITIONAL DIRECT CARE WORKER SPENDING ADDS SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO THIRTY. HE STROKES. THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THEIR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOODS IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. RELATIVE TO HIGHER WAGE WORKERS THEY PAY MORE AND INVEST MORE IN THE ECONOMY SO YOU ARE GETTING A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BOOST. WITH A LIVABLE WAGE AND I'M FUNDING FINALLY WE'RE ENHANCING THE DIRECT CARE WORKER FINANCIAL WELL. BEING YOU'RE DOUBLING THEIR RETURN THURMOND SAVING AND REDUCING THE USE OF PUBLIC AS- THAT YOU HEARD FROM THE S. OUT YES YEAH YOU. PRESENTATION BY ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS IS JUST A LIVABLE WAGE PIECE OF THIS. SORT RETURNED ON THE NEXT SLIDE. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE THINK. BUT THE STATE'S OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT AS YOU LOOK AT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY IN THIS SECTOR YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE HUMAN CAPITAL WE DON'T GET QUALITY MAGICALLY. EVEN IF YOU GOT RID OF THESE BAD APPLES WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN INVESTMENT A POSITIVE INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING THIS CARE GIVER PIPE. IN ENHANCING TRAINING AND EDUCATION. AND THAT MEANS I AND I KNOW THE CNA TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA DONE WORKING CALIFORNIA FOR THE MORE FOUNDATION WE FOR CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN THE FOREFRONT OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION THERE ARE MANY STATES THAT ARE MUCH FURTHER ALONG. IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND ON GOING IN SERVICE SUPPORT FOR THIS FRONTLINE STAFF. WE GOT TO THINK. ABOUT HOW WE ACTUALLY FACILITATE CO ADVANCE WHICH COULD NOT US TO THE WHERE WE WOULD HAVE MORE NOR TO IN HER SECTOR MORRELL THE END. MORE SOCIAL. MORE H. R. MANA AND BY THE SOME THE BEST HOME THEN. THAT WE HAVE MET IN THE HIGH OF NURSING HOME THAT I DO IN OVER YEARS. STARTED OUT AS C. N. SO WE MAY TO THINK ABOUT A REAL INVESTMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH ARAB OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. TO ACTUALLY ADVANCE CAREERS. RACING CAR. IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL. PART OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHAT PROVIDERS ARE WILLING TO PAY AN ABLE TO PAY PART OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. PART OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE REACH REDISTRIBUTE DOLLARS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM AND PART OF THIS HAS TO BE A SOCIETAL COMMITMENT. TO PAYING HIGHER WAGES. TO A PROFESSIONAL WORKING STAFF. ON THESE ARE SEEN AS THE- WORKERS. AND THEY ARE. THEY ARE CARING. FOR WE RECOMMEND THAT WE PREPARE UNIVERSAL WORKERS AND WE ACTUALLY WERE WORKING WITH THE MORE FOUNDATION TO EXPLORE HOW CALIFORNIA MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS. THAT IS WE PREPARE WORKERS ACROSS ALL SETTINGS. WE DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE CERTIFICATION FOR CNA'S FOR HOME CARE AIDES WE. START TO BEGIN TO BUILD AN OCCUPATION ACROSS ALL OF THE SETTINGS SO THAT THEY CAN NO. VERY FLEXIBLE. INCOME OF THE TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP A LOT MORE SO. IN NURSING. IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO TRAIN HARD CARE WORK UP THE C. STAY. THAT'S WHAT IN. STATE RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES IN ORDER TO THINK ABOUT FRANCE AND FINALLY I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THE STATE LEVEL AT REFORMING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT FINANCING. JUST AS WASHINGTON STATE AND NUMBER NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT AND I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ALSO IS TAKING A LOOK AT THIS. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ON MEDICAID. BUT JUST ABOVE THAT ONE MIGHT THE MODERATE INCOME IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS PRETTY DARN HOT AT THIS POINT I KNOW I USED TO LIVE THERE AND I HAVE FRIENDS WHO STILL DO. HOW CAN THEY AFFORD TO PAY. FOR THE SERVICE. I DON'T HAVE MEDICATE. HOW TO THEY PAY PRIVATE IN A NURSING HOME WHEN WE KNOW. I MEAN DOES IT MAKE SENSE THAT THAT AN INTERIM MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW- YOU KNOW THE- THE APPLICANT WHOSE APPLICATION WAS DENIED TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE YEAH I GUESS I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST AND I DON'T KNOW THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT TO COMMENT ON ON ON THAT ONE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY. THAT SOMETIMES APPLICATIONS ARE DENIED FOR AN ACCURATE BASED ON INACCURATE INFORMATION ENACTED REASONS THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS THROUGH THESE AND FREQUENTLY THOSE DECISIONS ARE OVERTURNED SO I'VE AGAIN NOT KNOWING THAT THE PARTICULAR SITUATION I DO THANK. YOU NOTE DUE PROCESS AND REVIEW OF THESE OF TE HAVE ANY KIND OF DENIAL IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IS CERTAINLY AS AS AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR AND PUBLIC DEFENDER I CAN CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF DUE PROCESS BUT- I THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NURSING HOME RESIDENT PROTECTION CONSUMER PROTECTION- PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. I MEAN WOULDN'T AS AS THE LICENSING AGENCY- AND THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WE WOULDN'T- WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE THAT THAT IF A APPLICANTS AB AN APPLICATION FOR OPERATING AND KNOWS THE NURSING HOME WAS DENIED THEN YOU KNOW WHILE THEY'RE CERTAINLY ENTITLED TO THEIR RIGHT TO APPEAL. THAT IN THE MEANTIME YOU KNOW THE PER SHOULD BE WITH THE FINDING OF THE AGENCY THAT THAT THEIR APPLICATION TO OPERATE THE FACILITY WAS DENIED WELL LET ME BRING LET ME LET ME PLAY THIS OUT JUST A LITTLE BIT. WHERE DOES THE FACILITY GO THEM. GOOD TO GO BACK TO THE PRIOR. OPERATOR IN SOME CASES WE KNOW A SITUATE WE KNOW OF SITUATIONS FREQUENTLY WERE SOMETIMES. MAYBE A SITUATION WOULD BE THAT- MAYBE WOULD. NOT I DON'T WANT FREELY BUT A SITUATION WHERE. A FACILITY HAS. CHANGED OWNERSHIP BE UP PRIOR OWNER HAS GOTTEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS- RETIRED MOVED ON. AND IN SOME CASES THAT IF THE NEW OWNER IS SHIP IS DENIED WHETHER INTERIM OR PERMANENT. WHERE DOES THAT GO. WHO WHO'S GONNA WHO'S GONNA BECOME THE NEW OPERATOR YEAH AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S A CONSIDERATION I THINK TO MAKE YOU KNOW SORT OF A BLANKET NOTION THAT SOMEONE TONIGHT CANNOT. THE ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS IN THOSE DOWN THE LINE. ISSUES HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. I KNOW I APPRECIATE YOU RAISING THAT POINT BECAUSE LIKE I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A- IN AN UNSPOKEN OR UNDER DRESSED TO THE CHALLENGE IN IN IN THE INDUSTRY I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW IF WE DO- CALL UPON OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES TO ENFORCE. YOU KNOW OUR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS IS I MEAN THAT THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO SHUT DOWN AND LEAD TO THE LOSS OF THAT THAT THAT NURSING HOME BEDS- BUT I MEAN IS. THERE THAT THE LAW DOES ALLOW FOR. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PETITION FOR RECEIVERSHIP. IT DOES AND- WHY WHY WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE FOR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT A PARTICULARLY APPEALING PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK. I MEAN I THINK YOU HAVE TO ALSO CONSIDER THAT TOOTH THE BILL BUILDINGS NEED STABILITY. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ATTRACT WORK RETRACT AND RETAIN WORKFORCE AS WELL AND THEN THEY NEED THEY NEED THAT IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO- WORK WITH THEIR HOSPITAL PARTNERS AND WITH THEIR STAFF AS WELL. BUILDINGS IN RECEIVERSHIP IN AND IN TURMOIL ARE NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY I WOULD SAY SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A CONSIDERATION AS WELL I MEAN I DON'T AGAIN. I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK WITH THERE'S A ONE SIZE ON IN A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE TO KIND OF RESPOND IN THAT BUT I JUST BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT. NOTION I BELIEVE GOING RECEIVERSHIP WHO'S GOT AYE AGAIN WHO'S GOING TO OPERATE THEM. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH KEEP THE LIST I NOW. OF POTENTIAL ADMINISTRATORS TO GO IN AND STEP IN BUT THOSE ARE NEVER. PARTICULARLY GOOD SITUATIONS WELL I MEAN IT AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT- MR RECHNITZ A- GOT A START IN THE CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME INDUSTRY BY- BY BEING APPOINTED AS A RECEIVER AND- AND- AT THE- SEVERAL NURSING HOME. FACILITIES BUT- YEAH AND I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT THAT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION I THINK THAT'S IT IS IMPORTANT IMPORTANT SAFETY VALVE. THING THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE A PREFERABLE PREFERABLE. LOCATION FOR ANYBODY. WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE MISTER CORNET THE EXAMPLE THAT I RAISED EARLIER THEY THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS CITED IN THE- THE NPR ARTICLE LET ME SHOULD THE SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS WHO PRESENTLY CLAIMS TAKE A COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT TO BE. SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE A NURSING HOME IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YEP THIS MESSAGE I DO NOT KNOW THAT SITUATION WHATSOEVER SO I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE COMMENTING ON THAT OKAY. BUT- HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING IF SOMEONE OF FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD A DEGREE FROM UNIVERSITY. SHOULD THEY BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE NURSING HOMES DID CALIFORNIA I SUSPECT ANYONE WHO HAS COMMITTED FRAUD THAT IT'S GOING TO BE. CAUGHT THAT IS THAT IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IT IS TO SOME ONE MECHANISM OR ANOTHER. AGAIN NOT KNOWING I DON'T WANT TO. SPEAK TO THE SITUATION AND AGAIN I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY TO YOU- WHAT WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF EXAMPLES. WERE WHETHER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND ENTITIES. HAVE INFORMATION THEY THINK IS ACCURATE THAT IS NOT. BY JUST CAUTION ON THAT I WHY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THEIR SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE CONFIDENTIAL I SUSPECT I DON'T KNOW THOUGH. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I KNOW I KNOW TO A CLOSER WAITING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL WE WILL TAKE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT- BUT I THINK THE GRAVITY OF THE OF THIS HEARING AND THE INFORMATION ARE GETTING I THINK. I DON'T MIND STAYING A LITTLE LATER TO- TO GET THIS INFORMATION SO I WAS WOULDN'T DONE DO YOU ASSOCIATE YOU HAVE- PROPOSAL THAT DID THE WE MIGHT CONSIDER IN CHANGING HOW QUALITY ASSURANCE FUNDS ARE. ARE DISPERSED TO MEET IS THERE. I WAS YOU SPOKE ABOUT QUALITY ASSURANCE FUNDS AND I THINK QUALITY ASSURANCE AS SURE AS FUNDS ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT. FOR NAY YOUR PERSPECTIVE- DO YOU TO ASSOCIATE YOU HAVE ANY POSITION ON ON HOW THAT WOULD PLAY OUT YES THANK YOU- MISTER FOR THE QUESTION I THINK- IN PARTICULAR DURING THE SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE PROCESS ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT- HOW DO WE MOVE THE STRUCTURE WE DEFINITELY HAVE TALKED ABOUT QUALITY ONE OF THE THINGS. IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT THE QUALITY- ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE COST. AND THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WHICH THAT WE THE STATE IS GOING TO MOVE WE ARE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT QUALITY PAYMENT WOULD GO AWAY TO THE AUTHORS POINT. THOSE FACILITIES I DID RECEIVE THIS COST DID THEY ACTUALLY DID BETTER WHEN IT CAME TO QUALITY- TO HER POINT A LOT OF THOSE FACILITIES THAN A QUALIFIED BECAUSE OF OTHER REASONS CITATIONS AND STUFF. BUT I THINK THAT THE SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE PROCESS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT QUALITY LOOKS LIKE WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES. WHAT WHAT IT'S BEING USED CURRENTLY THAT CAN BE MAYBE LOOK RE LOOKED AT- AND RESTRUCTURED SO THAT IN THE NEW STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE STATE IS GOING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO. IMPROVE QUALITY SO WE HAVE PROPOSALS WE'RE BRINGING THEM TO THE SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE- STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO. TO WORK ON THIS THANK YOU- A QUESTION- ARE MOST OF THEM MOST OF YOUR MEMBERS WHO WORK IN NURSING HOMES THE SEIU MEMBERS. ARE THOUGH ARE THEY WORKING IN NOT FOR PROFIT SETTINGS OR THEY WORKING IN FOR PROFIT SETTINGS. I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE YOU FALSE INFORMATION SO I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO MY LOCAL AND I CAN GET YOU THAT. INFORMATION THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT SO. SO AND THE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL IN PERSON- YES THANK YOU FOR HAVING ARMS AND MISTER CORNET- CUT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU- SO APPRECIATE. THAT THANK YOU. FOR YOU'RE YOU'RE- GONNA. THOUGHTS ON THE LICENSE PROCESS AND I CAN IMAGINE. FROM INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT IT IS IT IS FRUSTRATING. FOR THOSE OPERATORS WHO ARE WHO ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST AND- AND TRYING TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND- AND I DO WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT. THAT THAT WE ARE ON THIS DIET- DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE REALLY HIGH QUALITY OPERATORS OUT THERE WE KNOW THERE ARE. ABSOLUTELY NO THERE ARE- BUT YOU'VE BEEN YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. WE AS A LEGISLATORS RESPOND. TO BAD ACTORS QUITE FRANKLY OR THINGS THAT SIMPLY AREN'T WORKING. THIS IS A CLASSIC. THIS COULD BE THE POSTER CHILD FOR CLASSIC A DYSFUNCTIONAL OF THINGS- IN IN GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW AND OUR ABILITY OVERSEE THE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND QUALITY CARE FOR OUR FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND SO. I UNDERSTAND STAFF DIFFICULT TO FIND IT'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT MY DISTRICT- RURAL AREAS OR ARE ARE NOTORIOUSLY CHALLENGING FOR ALL HEALTH CARE- A PERSONAL AS WELL. I KNOW MEDICARE RATES ARE NOT AS HIGH AS A- PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING PECULIAR HAPPENING OUT THERE AND THAT'S THE ENTRANCE OF. PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTING INVESTING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. SO THAT TELLS ME THERE'S MONEY OUT THERE THERE'S PROFIT OUT THERE BECAUSE PRIVATE EQUITY IS NOT GOING TO GO INTO FACILITIES IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RETURN- THAT'S- AND I'VE I'VE HEARD THIS FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC OF PRIVATE EQUITY SO. THIS IS I'M NOT JUST PULLING THIS OUT OF THE YEAR. THEY'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. SO MANY OF- MANY OF THE OWNERS OF A LOT OF HOMES MAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY- ESPECIALLY THROUGH THEIR USE OF- RELATED PARTIES. WE BECAME AWARE THAT SEVERAL YEARS AGO LOOK AT THAT. IT'S ALLOWED- BUT. IT'S STILL TROUBLING BECAUSE- IT FEELS A LITTLE LIKE. ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL I CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER WAY TO SAY THAT AT THIS POINT SO CAN YOU GIVE US. AN ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MANY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. MIGHT BE USING SKINNER THE RELATED PARTIES AND HOW PROFITABLE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR OWNERS WE HEARD FROM WAS VALENTINE. IT IS REALLY PROFITABLE WELL I HAVE TO- WELL FOR THE RECORD I DISAGREED WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING WITH OUTSIDE SAID. SO AND I WITHOUT GETTING INTO THAT I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GET INTO THAT BUT I WANT TO I DID I I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN GIVE YOU FIGURES ON THIS BUT I WANT I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL PERSPECTIVE. ON THIS ISSUE OF RELATED PARTIES THE DEPARTMENT OF. HEALTH CARE SERVICES AUDITS IN MINUTE DETAIL EVERY EXPENDITURE OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THEY DO ACTUALLY TWO YEARS IN ARREARS- AND THEN THAT'S HOW FACILITIES ARE PAID THIS THE FEE FOR SERVICE- SITUATION THEY HAVE FACILITIES HAVE TO DOCUMENT EVERY SINGLE THING IF CD IF THE DH CS FIND SOMETHING. THAT IS OUT OF LINE IN SOME WAY THAT IS DENIED AND THOSE AT FACILITIES pARE NOT REIMBURSED FOR THAT THEM SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CHECKS ON RELATED PARTIES NOW I WILL I WILL TAKE IT- RIGHT RIGHT AWAY. THE ISSUE A PRIVATE EQUITY. I WILL TAKE IT. THANK YOU BYE AS YOU SAID YOU SAID IT MR CHAIRMAN WOULD. THE OTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS THOUGH IS IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS SUCH A- PROFITABLE SITUATION. WE WOULD HAVE MORE PEOPLE. RUSHING TO GET INTO THIS PROFESSION THAT IS NOT THE CASE THERE ARE ALMOST NO NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BEING CONSTRUCTED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE IT IS NOT A PLACE THAT IS. A PLACE TO COME IN AND DO PARTICULARLY WELL RIGHT NOW IT JUST ISN'T THE COST OF THE COST OF OPERATING CALIFORNIA THE COST THE REGULATORY COSTS ARE ENORMOUS. SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A AB PROVE IT MAY NOT BE. EXACTLY WHAT IT APPEARS I WOULD ALSO JUST MENTION TO YOU THAT- TO EFFECTIVE IN REFERENCE TO THE QUESTION DO YOU HAVE FROM SWEDEN. OF THE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE GOT ROUGHLY CORRECT. BUT 85% OF PRIVATELY OWNED. BUT- TEN PERCENT. ARE PUB ARE ARE- ARE- NONPROFITS ABOUT 5% I BELIEVE. OUR GOVERNMENTAL OUT THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE VETS HOMES- ADVOCATES HOMES NOT THAT KIND OF THING. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN WHO IS CARED FOR BETWEEN. THE NONPROFITS AND THE OF THE OTHERS. MOST OF THE MEDIC CAL POPULATION IS CARED FOR IN THE LARGEST GROUP. THE NONPROFITS TEND TO CARE FOR MOSTLY MORE THAN MEDICARE SHORTER TERM POPULATIONS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION I THINK- THAT THAT I THINK SOMETIMES GETS MISSED AND SOME OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL. SO I WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE DEEPER HERE BECAUSE- I WAS A MID PACK REPORT- LITERATURE REVIEW ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY INVOLVED. AND THEY LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF ISSUES IT WAS A LITERATURE REVIEW SO- IT'S NOT RAW DATA LOVE TO SEE RAW DATA QUITE FRANKLY- BUT- 4% OF HOSPITALS. ARE ARE HAVE PRIVATE EQUITY. INVESTMENT THERE. 11% OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THERE OBVIOUSLY IF THAT'S HAPPENING AND THESE THIRD PARTY ARRANGEMENTS. YOU WOULDN'T GO TO A LOT OF EFFORT TO DO THAT IF THERE WASN'T SOME SORT OF A MOTIVE TO MAKE TO MAKE MORE MONEY OR TO TRY TO CREATE A BETTER TAX INCENTIVE OR PROCESS FOR YOURSELF. SO YOU KNOW WE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST OF LET'S SEE. HOW WE YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN DIG DEEPER INTO THAT AND GET GET MORE INFORMATION SO. I SAY TO WIN THERE WITH TWELVE HUNDRED AND ONE ALSO MAKE REFERENCE TO A POINT YOU MADE EARLIER TO- MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE BECAUSE I APPRECIATED THE POINT YOU MADE. AND THAT IS BEING RESPONSIVE TO- PARTICULAR INCIDENTS IN PARTICULAR FACILITIES YOU HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIRTY YEARS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU DO HERE. AND BEING RESPONSIVE TO YOUR TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS I WOULD JUST URGE YOU THOUGH PLEASE DON'T MAKE POLICY BASED ON A FEW OF THOSE THIS TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE FACILITY. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS I MEAN I DON'T SAY MAJORITY I WOULD SAY. THE VAST VAST VAST VAST VAST GROUP PROVIDE GREAT QUALITY CARE EVERY DAY AND THE ONES THAT HAVE ARE STRUGGLING ARE STRUGGLING FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. AND FOR ME AT LAST IT'S ALL IT'S ALMOST AN ISSUE HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE STRUGGLING FACILITIES VERSUS DOING SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY THAT MAKES IT HARDER IN THE ENTIRE SECTOR GOING FOR THAT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. ON THE PRIVATE EQUITY- I GUESS THE ONLY THING I'D SAY TO WITH IF IT'S 11% OF TWELVE HUNDRED FACILITIES THAT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT. THIS PARTICULAR SITUATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I DO KNOW. AT LEAST NATIONALLY BECAUSE I LOOK AT THAT A LOT OF THE NATIONAL DATA ON THIS AS WELL. THERE'S A LOT OF. BAD BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT BEEN MADE BY SOME IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY WORLD TO AS TO WHAT THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO COULD HAVE BEEN IT'S BENEFICIAL TO THEM IN SOME CASES. SOME PRIVATE EQUITY WITH OWNING THE LAND AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THE LAND THAT FACILITIES THAN WE'RE PAYING THE RENT ON THAT AS ACTUALLY DROVE A LOT OF FACILITIES. OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND BUT WITH THEY WERE CHARGING. EXORBITANT RATES TO THE OPERATORS OF THE FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY WAS ONE OF THE CRISES WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE STATE'S. AND THAT THAT INFORMATION THAT WAS NATIONAL DATA THAT WASN'T I WOULD LOVE TO SEE STATE DATA I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE IT AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT- GOING FORWARD SO. HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SO I KNOW THAT- I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS WE'RE ALWAYS HEARING IT'S YOU KNOW WE WANT HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES WE WANT STAFFING WAIVERS- GET YET YOU HAVE. YOU MANY OF YOUR OWNERS MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THEM- IN RENT. AND CONSULTING FEES AND- THROUGH SOME OF THESE THIRD PARTY ARRANGEMENTS- CAN YOU HELP US THAT FEELS LIKE A BIG DISCONNECT. I WOULD SAY. GO BACK WHAT I WHAT I WOULD GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID EARLIER. ALL THOSE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALL REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AN AUDITED IF SOMETHING IS. IN CORRECTLY DONE. IT IS DISALLOWED. SO I JUST I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT. I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THIS BUT- THIS THIS SECTOR IS. MORE TRANSPARENT THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE HEALTHCARE WORLD. IN TERMS OF ITS FINANCES. SO WE SHALL SEE YEAH I THOUGHT I'D I JUST. BY THAT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THIS IS EXACTLY AS IS BEING PORTRAYED FREQUENTLY HOMES. IT'S HARD NOT TO BE SKEPTICAL FROM OUR POSITION- WHEN WE HEAR SOME. SOME PRETTY EGREGIOUS EGREGIOUS STORIES AND I WOULD I WOULD ASK YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU AS THAT THAT JUROR YOUR YOUR ASSOCIATION IS INTERESTED IN WORKING THIS WE HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO WORK FOR THIS I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL SIT DOWN AND REALLY WORK ON THIS ISSUE- AND- AND HELP WITH THIS LICENSING PROCESS. AND RE CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE FACILITIES CLOSE THAT IS THAT IS THE THAT'S THE FINE LINE WE WALK HERE IT'S REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING. BUT WE HAVE TO BE QUALITY THEY HAVE TO BE SERVING THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT INDUSTRY IT'S IS NOT WITHOUT CHALLENGES. IT'S BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFICULT INDUSTRIES OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT WITHOUT CHALLENGES- BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE WE PUT YOU KNOW PUT OUR PATIENTS FIRST OUR PROFIT SECOND- YOU TAKE YOUR YOUR PATIENCE WELL. THE PROFITS DO FOLLOW- AND I AND- AND THEY DIED BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO BE REASONABLE- AND- AND I THINK THEY NEED TO BE FAIR. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST PATIENCE. THE RESIDENTS NEED TO BE WELL CARED FOR AND I HOPE WE CAN GET THERE. CAN AGREE MORE- MISTER CHAIRMAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS BECAUSE OF A WEAK WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE. THERE IS I GOT SO SAID SUBSTANTIAL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THIS ONE ALSO EMPHASIZED. MY ASSOCIATION IS TOTALLY DRIVEN TO. TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH DRIVING QUALITY. DRIVING INCREASED IN QUALITY. WE WORKED- AND OUR LAST AT SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE DEAL WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE. TO TRY TO IN BED IN OUR RATES. PART OF THE RATE INCREASES. WOULD HAVE BEEN TIED TO QUALITY THAT THE STATE ABANDONED THAT PROCESS AS WE WENT THROUGH IT BUT WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THE WITH A LOT OF BENEFIT THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THE STATE- MONITOR SOME OF THE QUALITY FUNCTION BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT TOO AND I THINK WE'VE GOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BUT WE ARE VERY. WE BELIEVE. YOU KNOW QUALITY IS. AS THE ADAGE GOES QUALITY IS JOB ONE AND THERE'S JUST NO QUESTION THAT'S GOOD FOR. ITS GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES THAT'S GOOD FOR PATIENTS IT'S GOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND IT'S GOOD FOR OUR STAFF. TO WELL I THINK M. AND I WAS. QUIT BUT IT WASN'T JUST ONE MINUTE SO AND UP MISTER MERCY JUST A COMMENT THAT I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION FOR THE DOCTOR STONE BUT- YOU KNOW. WE DON'T LIKE HAVING TO LEGISLATE TO- THE BAD ACTORS. WHAT WE WOULD REALLY LOVE IS FOR THE INDUSTRY. TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE BAD ACTORS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR THAT IS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- WE SEE BUT WE SEE THIS THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT HEALTHCARE WE SEE THIS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE TO WE END UP HAVING TO REGULATE TO TE BAD ACTORS AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUNISH THE GOOD ACTORS. BUT IF INDUSTRY ITSELF'S. BUT HELP FOCUS AND CHANGE BEHAVIOR SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS WE WOULDN'T BE HERE THIS HEARING WILL BE HAPPENING. I WILL SAY THIS. WHEN I WENT THAT THE NUMBER OF THE COMMON INFECTIONS AND DEATHS THAT HAPPEN AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRULY APPALLING. IT USE WHAT YOU SAID HERE THAT THAT WE WERE LIKE A SHINING STAR IN THE NATION. I'M SHOCKED. WELL I THINK DISAPPOINTED WELL EXCEPT I DON'T SEE A DOCTOR WHAT I THINK HANG ON BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE. I'M SORRY. I'M I'M- STILL WAY TOO MANY DEATHS. WAY TOO MANY DEATHS. WE SAW THIS PANDEMIC PLAYING OUT IN WASHINGTON A COUPLE OF MONTHS BEFORE. IT STARTED IN CALIFORNIA AND YET IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO READY AND BEGIN TO REACT WE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON WE KNEW IT YOU SAW IT PLAYING OUT IT STILL TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS. AND THAT MEANT PEOPLE GOT SICK AND THAT MEANT. THAT PEOPLE DIED. I EXPECT BETTER FROM US WE DESERVE BETTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND I DO I'M I'M A LITTLE PART OF THE YEAH IF WE'RE IF WE WERE THE BEST A SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON OTHER STATES AND- PRETTY PRETTY PRETTY SHOCKED BY THAT WELL IT JUST IT JUST AS A POINT ON THAT. EVERY DEATH IS A TRAGEDY- I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WOULD THAT IS IT WAS VERY HARD ON OUR STAFF WHO WORK IN THOSE FACILITIES CLEARLY ON THE FAMILIES. NO QUESTION BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE FACING AT THE TIME WE ARE FACING A PANDEMIC THAT. IT IT'S THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. FOR ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH. MEDIC WITH SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT IS A SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE FACING A PANDEMIC. WITH THE GUIDANCE AND THE CLINICAL GUIDANCE. WITH CHANGING. RAPIDLY IF YOU RECALL FRED MONTHS. OF FACILITIES WERE TOLD AND THE PUBLIC WAS TOLD. THAT IF YOU WEREN'T. I DID NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS YOU COULD NOT SPREAD THE DISEASE. THAT WAS INCORRECT. WE KNOW THAT NOW IT THAT WOULD BUT THAT WAS. THAT THAT IT ENTERED BUILDINGS THAT WAY INITIALLY AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAD NO TESTING. WE HAD NO PP FOR MANY MANY MONTHS. AND AS I SAID PEOPLE WERE KIND OF UNDER LEARNING WHAT WAS GOING ON. IN TIME- IN IN REAL TIME- AS TRAGIC AS IT IS- THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW WHERE WE ARE. I THINK IT'S A IT'S A TRIBUTE. TO HOW WELL THE VACCINES OF WORKED AND HOW WELL OUR FACILITIES HAVE UP HAVE- YOU KNOW WE'RE RAISE THE LEVEL THEIR GAME ON INFECTION PREVENTION- AND KNOWLEDGE- AND SO I THINK THAT'S- IF THERE'S ANY IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING TO THIS VERY DARK CLOUD THAT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS. APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE I AM. THAT THAT CLOUT DOESN'T HAVE A SILVER LINING FOR ME SO. THANK YOU- DR STONE AND IN A NUMBER MR RESEARCH HAS QUESTION SO- DO YOU DO YOU EXPECT UP CONGRESS TO ACT QUICKLY. ON ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT THIS MORNING- YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE. WE MAY GET CHILD CARE. AND I MEAN THAT'S THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RECONCILIATION BILL. WHERE SITE WORRY ON THE WORK FORCE SIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUGE INVESTMENT. FOUR HUNDRED BILLION FOR HCV ALISON WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY EXPAND OUT TO OTHER SETTINGS THAT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE CUT BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO BE CUT THE OTHER THING THAT WE WORK ON. IN OUR GROUP IS AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING PROVIDERS AND LEADING AGE AND THAT IT MAY BE ON THE CUTTING BOARD AS WELL SO- I WISH I COULD TELL YOU I HAVE NO IDEA- WE NONE OF OUR POLICY PEOPLE KNOW ANYMORE THAN THOSE OF US WHO READ THE NEWSPAPER- SOMETHING I'LL COME OUT OF CONGRESS- WHAT WHAT ENDS UP GETTING CUT OF COURSE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS IF WE GET A CHILD CARE. BENEFIT THIS HELPS OUR FRONTLINE CARE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY NEED AND IT'S EXTREMELY VARIABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT ACCESS TO VOTE THROUGH THOSE TYPES OF BENEFITS THEY GET THROUGH THE NURSING HOME THESE DAYS SO ON THE CHILD CARE BENEFIT WOULD HELP- FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE WOULD HELP- SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS- GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU I DID WANT TO SAY ONE OTHER THING THAT LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND- NO I DON'T. DON'T THINK IT'S AN EITHER OR WE NEED WE NEED REGULATION- MY FORTY PLUS YEARS OF THIS AND- LOOKING AT A LOT OF STATES. HAS TO DO WITH THE QUESTION OF. WHERE SHOULD WE INVEST IN A REGULATORY PROCESS AND WHERE DO WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE THAT BOTH HAS CARROTS AND STICKS ATTACHED TO IT AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED WE NEED A PROCESS A REGULATORY PROCESS THAT DOES NOT ALLOW- THESE BAD ACTORS I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD IN THIS. KIND OF A SOCIETY FOR THE INDUSTRY ITSELF TO REGULATE THOSE GUYS OUT ALTHOUGH I THINK THE MORE THAT WE GET TO A HIGHER QUALITY SYSTEM THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWING THOSE TIES IN TO BEGIN WITH. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE COULD USE A THINK ABOUT A REGULATORY APPROACH THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A- CARROT AND STICK APPROACH WITHIN IT OKAY FOR PERFORMANCE. ACTIVITY THAT REALLY UNDERSTANDS HOW DO YOU MEASURE GOOD QUALITY HOW DO YOU AUDIT GOOD QUALITY. I MEAN IT'S GREAT TO HAVE STAFFING RATIOS BUT THAT'S THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IN OUR ORGANIZATIONS WE NEED TO HOLD THESE ORGANIZATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY DELIVER CARE EVERY SINGLE DAY. WHAT ARE THEIR WORK PROCESSES YOU KNOW THIS HAPPENS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. IT HAPPENS IN THE ERROR IN THE AIRPLANE INDUSTRY. AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF APPROACH OF OVERSIGHT AND AUDITING AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING A LOT MORE AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BLACK BOX WITH IN. THE NURSING HOME AND I THINK DR STEINBERG WOULD PROBABLY AGREE WITH ME THAT IT'S ALL DEVIL IN THE DETAILS AND IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS THERE'S TOO MUCH MEDIOCRITY FOR ME. THAT IS THE PROBLEM. ASIDE FROM THESE BAD APPLES. I THINK WE OUGHT TO RAISE THE BAR. TO AT LEAST AND THEN I WOULD BE HAPPY. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR STONE THE SUMMER CITY THANK YOU- DR STONE I- ONE THING I'VE LEARNED FROM- LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY IS THAT I CONSISTENTLY HEAR THE- THAT IF YOU EVER HAVE TO GO TO A NURSING HOME LOOK FOR A NONPROFIT NURSING HOME. AND. AND THAT GUY IT APPEARS THE DATA APPEARS TO SHOW THAT THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE HIGHER QUALITY OF CARE IN THE NONPROFIT TO- OF THE FACILITIES IN GENERAL LIKE OF COURSE I'M SURE THERE ARE THERE ARE- WONDERFUL FOR PROFIT TO. NURSING HOMES YEAH BUT- GUY I WANT TO ASK YOU I MEAN. THANK YOUNG. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS YOUR- OPINION AS TO- A NURSING HOME- OWNER WHOSE LICENSE IS PENDING- DENIED- I HAD SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD SUCH A NURSING HOME OWNER- BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE. THIS IS MY- PERSONAL OPINION I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR. WAITING AGE OR ANY OTHER ENTITY BUT I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND- NO I DON'T THINK THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD A LICENSE DENIED SHOULD BE. ACCESSING ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE ALSO THE WHOLE QUESTION OF WHAT WAS RAISED AROUND INTERIM. WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE FACILITIES IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY OWNING IT. THE INSTABILITY OF STAFF WHICH IS HORRIBLE TO BEGIN WITH ITS WORST I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THIS AND WE SEE A LOT MORE TURNOVER NOW AND CHURNING OF THESE NURSING HOMES THAN WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. IT IS HORRIFIC FOR THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE SO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY ANSWER- SO I BUT I BUT I DO THINK AGAIN IF WE HELD A STANDARD. WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE REQUIRING OF ALL OWNERS LICENSE ALL ADMINISTRATORS. OF ALL NURSES. 60% OF ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT I AM ON THE BOARD OF A NONPROFIT NURSING HOME AND CARE ORGANIZATION AND I WILL NOT NAME. I KNOW FIRST COMMAND AND DID A STUDY OF WELL THE NURSE COMPETENCIES 60% OF THOSE NURSES FAILED. YOUR COMPETENCIES AND THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS A FAIRLY DECENT ORGANIZATION. AND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DO NOT INVEST IN THE QUALITY OF OUR STAFF SO ARE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THIS PART OF IT IT'S THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. TO WORK DO YOUR WINDOWS ARE THEY PRACTICING TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OUR OUR FRONT GOING NURSES ARE LPNS DO THEY KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE DOING I DID A STUDY IN CALIFORNIA IT WAS SCARY TO ME. I TO NONPROFITS TO FOR PROFITS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE WERE VALUE WAITING BECAUSE WE DEVELOP THE NURSE TRAINING PROGRAM THERE. IT'S THE LEVEL LACK OF INVESTMENT I MEAN I DON'T WANT TO GET DR STEINBERG INVOLVED IN THIS BUT YOU KNOW THOSE OF US WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO DO GOOD CARE. UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IN THE BETTER ORGANIZATIONS IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED AND SUPPORTED ON AN ONGOING BASIS YOU CAN'T PRODUCE GREAT QUALITY. THAT'S WHAT I LOOK FOR WHEN I GO TO A NURSING HOME NOT JUST THAT THEY'RE NOT FOR PROFIT. SO THERE'S SOME CRAPPIE. IT'S IN THIS WORLD. BUT THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE STAFF WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. OKAY AND- YEAH SO YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT AND- IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE. THEY SHOULD BE PRACTICING ALL RIGHT LAST QUESTION TO ADOPT STONED AND TO- IS THE PRACTICE OF. OF IT- USING OR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF RELATED PARTIES IS THAT ALSO PREVALENT IN THE AMONG NONPROFIT NURSING HOMES. NOT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME INCENTIVE SO- THANK YOU. IT GREAT OKAY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL- WILL TAKE A COUPLE CLOSING COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN FOR. PUBLIC COMMENT BUT DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ANYTHING I SAY. I JUST WANT TO- SAYING CLOSING HERE BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK ALL WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE TODAY- WE LEARNED A LOT I'M GRATEFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE TO AND WORKING TO LEARN ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. RECOGNIZING COVE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ALL OF US- YOU KNOW PART OF MY- CONCERN AND- COMMENTS IS- YOU HAVE A MOTHER WHO LIVES IN ASSISTED LIVING IN WASHINGTON. THEY DID A FABULOUS JOB EARLY ON. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE CASES THAT I'M AWARE OF IN HER FACILITY. NONE THEY HAD A COUPLE STAFF PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING UP BUT THEY HAD NO RESIDENTS THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAD AND THERE'S A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE FACILITY THEY REACTED QUICKLY EARLY- WE DIDN'T REACT AS QUICKLY- IN CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T REACT AS EARLY- EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WASHINGTON- BEFORE US. AND SO THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION AND THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM WHEN I WHEN I TALK ABOUT THAT. WE ARE SENIORS ARE CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DURING COVERT- COBIT CANNOT BE AN EXCUSE TO NOT DO BETTER. I RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS A- THROUGHOUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THESE DAYS IT'S- AT THE EVERYTHING IS DELAYED AND THE ANSWER IS OFTEN WELL YOU KNOW WITH COCA.

IT OF COURSE FOR ONE IN COURT I TOOK CARE OF MY SISTER NURSING HOME FOR FOUR YEARS AND MY MOTHER IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR SEVEN YEARS I'VE SEEN THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ACCUSATIONS BY RESIDENTS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEXUAL ABUSE CAN OCCUR WHEN MALE STAFF BREEDING FEMALE RESIDENTS AND MAIL STAFF TOILETING FEMALE RESIDENTS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS SUCH AS SICK DYING AND RAPED I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN TO WIN THE RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RAPED BY MALE STAFF AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE ONLY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS BEING PAID BY MAIL STAFF OF THE GREGIS AND DISGUSTING TO THINK OF MALE SEXUALLY RAPING ELDERLY SICK AND DYING FEMALE RESIDENTS IS IT REALLY REALLY DOES HAPPEN THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TAKING ACCUSATIONS SERIOUSLY PERFORMING BACKGROUND CHECKS ON STAFF INCREASING CNA LPN RN WAGES.
