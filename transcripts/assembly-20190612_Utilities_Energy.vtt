00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:20.465
STRATEGY BECAUSE WE NEED.

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.668
PLACES TO TAKE THE FUEL THAT IS

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:26.704

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:28.339
DEVELOPMENT.

00:28:28.406 --> 00:28:29.541
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.309
THAT IS TO PUT IT INTO INTER

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.645
CONNECTED INTO THE PIPELINE --

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:35.580
AND THE FACT IS IT'S TAKING

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.482
LONGER THAN ANYONE OF ANY OF US

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:38.650

THESE PROJECTS UP AND RUNNING.

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:42.387
THEY CAN'T CLAIM THIS FINANCIAL

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.221
SUPPORT TILL THEY'RE UP AND

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:47.058
RUNNING AND THIS FORTY MILLION

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.526
DOLLARS IT YOU KNOW IT'S HAD A

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:50.261
BROAD BASE OF SUPPORT FOR A

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:52.263
NUMBER OF YEARS -- BUT IT'S ALSO

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.465
IMPORTANT TO PUT IT IN

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:55.834
PERSPECTIVE THE CAL RECYCLE AND

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.402
THEIR BEER ESTIMATING THAT WE'RE

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:58.870
GONNA NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.438
PROJECTS.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:03.174
STATEWIDE -- TO ADDRESS ORGANIC

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:04.642
WASTE THE END AND I'M NOT TALK

00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:05.543

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:12.517
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.519
SUPPORT A DOZEN MAYBE TWO DOZEN

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.187
INTERCONNECTS OVERTIME

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.123
SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS ABSOLUTELY

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:18.923
IMPORTANT.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.860

FORWARD OVER THE NEXT DECADE

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.599
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE SCALE

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:30.835

GAS INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.755

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.356

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.995
SO THE MORE OF THIS MATERIAL WE

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:12.597
CAN GET IN THE PIPELINE THE

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:13.798
BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE.

COULD YOU LOOK AT SOMEONE

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.839
ADDRESS THE THE CONCERN RAISED

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.574
BY THE THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:25.843
OF INS INCENTIVIZING MANEUVER

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:32.150
PRODUCTION.

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.151
HI YOU KNOW I I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:34.852
HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT I I THINK

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:38.556
IT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:41.192
SOMEBODY IS GOING ON REYES MORE

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:42.727
CATTLE SIMPLY TO PRODUCE MORE

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:43.928
MOVEMENT OR JUST.

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.296
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:53.404
HAPPEN BUT I MAYBE VIEW MIND.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.005
ONE FIVE FIVE THE REPRESENTED

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:54.772
I'M I'M I'M BEING TOLD THAT A

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.774
BETTER ANSWER WOULD COME FROM

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.109
THE ACTUAL DAIRY INDUSTRY.

00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.577
I'M SURE THE SENATOR HAS A LOT

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.279
OF GREAT THINGS TO SAY ON THIS

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.880
TOPIC BUT I WOULD JUST ADD THAT.

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:03.448
THE NUMBER OF DAIRIES IN

00:33:03.514 --> 00:33:04.916
CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.284
DECLINING FOR MANY YEARS AND

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.518
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:08.419
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:09.821
THE NUMBER OF CALORIES IN THE

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:11.155
STATE DECLINE ALSO.

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:13.057
SO NONE OF OUR DATA SUPPORTS THE

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:14.459
ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:18.663
INCENTIVIZE -- LARGER AND MORE

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.865
JERRY -- PRODUCTION IN

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:22.100
CALIFORNIA WILL DO THAT THE

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.735
BETTER ANSWER [inaudible]

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.002
DOCTOR EGGMAN.

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:25.636
I THINK YOU KNOW JUST GOING TO

00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:27.238
SAY AS AS IS THAT YOUR BAG AND

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:29.507
MY FOR A FIRST YEAR WE LOOK AT

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.641
ISSUES OF MILK PRICING AND I

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.009
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PRICING AND

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.879
AND THEN I THOUGHT I EVER WOULD --

00:33:34.946 --> 00:33:36.514
BUT YEAH THE THE THE ISSUE

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.483
REMAINS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF A

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.285
LOT OF OUR ARE VERY PROPER

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:43.421
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND A

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.256
pTHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:46.290
CALIFORNIA.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.592
THAT WE'VE SEEN THE AMOUNT OF

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.427
DARES GO DOWN BUT THENABOUT

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.362
HOUSE HAVE NOT WHICH MEANS THAT --

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:52.997
THE SMALL GUYS CAN'T CONTINUE TO

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:55.199
COMPETE AND SO THEY GET SOLD OUT

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:56.801
BY THE LARGER CORPORATE FORMS --

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:57.735
WHICH YOU KNOW IS IN A BAD WORD

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.270
IS BECAUSE THAT IF YOU HAVE TO

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:00.838
BE ABLE TO FARM IN BULK -- SO I

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:02.340
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:03.875
INCENTIVE TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT

00:34:03.941 --> 00:34:05.443
OF THE NEWER CONSUMED -- ARE

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.278
PRODUCED BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE

00:34:07.345 --> 00:34:08.713
NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AS

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.982
COST EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE TO

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.151
CONTINUE TO TO PRODUCED -- DERES

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.552
UP PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:15.987
CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS ONE MORE

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:17.121
AVENUE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.456
AS MY FRIEND DR QUIRK SAID IN

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:19.891
ADDITION TO WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:22.727
BE ELECTRIC GRID OVERNIGHT WE'VE

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.295
GOT CAL IS HERE WE'VE BY.

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:25.263
I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT WE STILL

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:26.631
WANT AGRICULTURE TO CONTINUE TO

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.366
THRIVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.635
SAFEST.

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:34.705
FOOD AND THEN -- AND FARMING

00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:35.606
PRACTICES.

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:36.207
SO WHY NOT CELEBRATE THOSE AND

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:37.208
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:38.743
SURE IT'S COST EFFECTIVE SO

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.677
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.145
THANK YOU.

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:44.682
OF THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED.

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.518
TO APPROPRIATIONS -- MR TING.

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.085
JUST A QUICK QUESTION COULD

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:49.687
COULD YOU GIVE ME EXAMPLES OF

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:50.922
THE PROJECT THAT HAVE BEEN.

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:54.258
FUNDED OR JUST WHAT TYPES OF

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:54.792
FIVE PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:58.729
GOTTEN FUNDING.

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:01.432
SO I BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:03.935
OFFICIALLY FUNDED ONE IS AC. R.

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:06.037
NAHR WHICH IS IN THE CALIFORNIA

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:07.905
TOWN OF PARIS -- NOT TO BE

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.407
CONFUSED WITH THE WOMEN'S WORLD

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:13.344
CUP -- BUT THAT IS IT IS ONE OF

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:14.612
THE MODEL PROJECTS FOR THE WHOLE

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.514
COUNTRY ACTUALLY THEY ARE TAKING

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.483
A MUNICIPAL ORGANIC WASTE FROM

SEVERAL CITIES.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.687

TRUCKS THAT SERVICE OF CITIES

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:31.295
AND PUTTING SOME OF THE FUEL --

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:35.533
RENEWAL RENEWAL AFTER GAS INTO.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.201
THE PIPELINE -- THE SECOND ONE

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:38.803
IS THAT CALTRAIN AND THAT'S IN

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.171
PIXLEY CALIFORNIA AND THAT IT'S

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.105
A DAIRY PROJECT THAT IS

00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.541
CURRENTLY INTERCONNECTED AND

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:48.279
INJECTING INTO SO CAUCUSES GRID

THE FACILITY IN PARIS IS.

00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:58.990
VERY IMPRESSIVE FACILITY AND NOT

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:00.458
UP TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.326

THAT THEY HAVE THERE BUT THEY'RE

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:04.729

IS KIND OF A HUB FOR BIO FUEL

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:27.518
