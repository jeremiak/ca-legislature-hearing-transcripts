MARCH THIS YEAR GOVERNOR

NEWSOME DECLARED A STATE OF

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:03.689
EMERGENCY. I IN MY DISTRICT TO

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.124
THE DEVASTATING FLOODS THAT

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.093
COST OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.761
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE.

00:12:08.828 --> 00:12:10.062
THIS LANGUAGE THE NICEST

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:11.530
HARDSHIP THAT MY DISTRICT FACES

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:13.466
BUT BY PROVIDING ABOUT ONE

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:18.504
POINT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

FLOOD RELIEF CLEAN UP TO THE

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:24.376
COUNTY OF CINEMA. MOST OF THE

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:25.511
EXPENDITURES I THINK OR

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:26.946
SUPPORTABLE BUT I WAS STRUCK BY

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.582
THE NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE YOUR

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.617
MARKS IN THIS TRAILER BILL ON

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.819
IT'S A COMMENT THAT I HAD ABOUT

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:34.453
THE BUDGET BILL IN CHIEF WILL

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.689
BE PASSED IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.757
AGO AND I WONDER WHY WE HAVE SO

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.059
MANY REMARKS IN HERE ONE WOULD

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.127
CALL IT PORK COLLOQUIALLY AND

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:42.228
I'M HOPING THAT THIS ISN'T AN

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:46.065
INDICATION OF THINGS TO COME

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:46.632
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:47.233
HEALTHY DIRECTION FOR US TO BE

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:51.437
GOING. SO UNDERSTANDING FROM

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:52.004
THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT.

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.839
MOST OF THE CHANGES IN HERE

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:54.840
WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.008
SHIFTS IN APPROPRIATIONS.

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:58.444
REFLECT UPDATES TO THE THREE

00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.345
PARTY AGREEMENT REACHED IN JUNE

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.212
SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.580
SOMETHING THAT. THE PARTIES

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.249
AGREE TO NEGOTIATIONS BUT IN

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:04.116
THE FLURRY OF LAST MINUTE

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:05.818
ACTIVITY. WAS NOT ACTUALLY

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:08.020
REFLECTED IN THE BILL. OR THERE

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:09.755
MIGHT IN PLACES WHERE WE HAVE

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:10.723
TO MAKE SOME TECHNICAL

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:11.790
CORRECTIONS ARE AT. ADDITIONAL

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:14.160
CHANGES. CERTAINLY FROM THE

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.561
ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.096
PERSPECTIVE. THE BUDGET ACTING

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:19.532
JUNE IS THE GOVERNING IN TERMS

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:21.667
OF THE REVENUES THAT WERE

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:22.301
EXPECTING. SO THE

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:23.169
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T LIKE TO

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:26.906
SEE MARK SWINGS IN ADDITIONAL

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.440
NEW PROGRAMS AND SPENDING.

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:30.109
BEYOND THAT IN. JUNE AND WE

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:34.146
THINK. THAT THE BUDGET JUNIOR

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:38.250
BEFORE YOU REFLECTS THAT SPIRIT.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:41.720

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.522
SPIRIT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:44.123
BUT THAT THE PROBLEM THAT I'M

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.890
HAVING WITH IT I DON'T THINK

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:45.324
FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.792
PERSPECTIVE THAT HAVING LOTS OF

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.994
LEGISLATIVE REMARKS IN THE

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.095

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:51.430

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.165
CRITICAL AS A MEMBER OF THE

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:54.166
LEGISLATURE TO SAY THIS BUT I

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.901
THINK IT'S A BETTER. IT'S JUST

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.404
BETTER FOR POP PUBLIC POLICY TO

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.138
THAT GRANT BROAD FUNDING TO

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.039
DEPARTMENTS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

TO PUT THE MONEY WHERE IT GOES

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.308
INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:07.046
THE POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT THE

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:07.680
LEGISLATURE BRINGS TO BEAR AND-

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:08.247

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:03.348
THIS WAS BASICALLY THAT PDSA

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.716
WAS CREATION FROM A COUPLE OF

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:05.250
YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF THE

00:18:05.317 --> 00:18:06.652
TIMING OF TRANSFERS AND THIS

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:07.753
WAS INITIALLY FOR WHAT WAS

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.854
GOING TO BE A DISCRETIONARY

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.189
DEPOSITED THE RAINY DAY FUND.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.290
AND OTHER AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:11.924
MORE RESERVES ARE IN THE RIGHT

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.826
PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION VIEW

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:14.593
IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.028
CURRENT RESERVE ACCOUNTS ARE

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:17.763
SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE FOR THE

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.831
DOWNTURN THAT MAY. THAT COULD

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:19.998
COME AT ANY POINT BUT AT THE

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:22.067
SAME TIME WE UNDERSTOOD THAT.

00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:25.671
AND NEGOTIATE WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:26.205
STAFF THIS WAS THE VEHICLE

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:32.911
WHERE. FLEXIBILITY MAKE TYPES.

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.646
DISCRETIONARY DEPOSITS AND SO

00:18:34.713 --> 00:18:39.618
WE WERE ABLE WHAT THIS LANGUAGE.

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:42.020
OKAY SO FIRST BILL PINE THAT SO

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:42.621
WE'VE GOT THE BUDGET

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:44.890
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE BSA

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.593
AND WE'VE GOT THE BUDGET

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:48.227
DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE V.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:49.895
D. S. A- AND AS IF THIS WASN'T

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:50.696
CONFUSING ENOUGH FOR OUR

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:51.597
CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:54.533
SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER I REALLY

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.334
THINK WE OUGHT TO PICK A

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.768
DIFFERENT NAME FOR THE PTSA. I

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:57.569
HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.604
PROVISION OF THIS BILL BECAUSE

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.240
AS I READ IT IT WOULD ALLOW THE

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:02.641
LEGISLATURE INDEED THE

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:04.309
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TAKE

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:07.045
MONEY OUT OF THE MEDIA THE B.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:09.181
S. SAY THE DISCRETIONARY OVER

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.183
FUNDING PSA AND MOVE IT INTO

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.453
THE B. D. S. SAY AND THE REASON

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.288
WHY I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.122
THAT THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:20.158
REQUIREMENTS BEFORE. WE CAN THE

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:24.229
MONEY IN THE BSA THAT GOVERNOR

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:24.830
HAS TO FIND A FISCAL STATE OF

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:31.270
EMERGENCY. SO I WOULD SAY WHEN

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.072
IT COMES TO THE BSA THERE ARE

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.073
THAT MANDATORY IN THE

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.075
DISCRETIONARY TO DEPOSITS. THE

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.777
RULES FOR THE MANDATORY

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.645
DEPOSITS ARE GOVERNED BY

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:40.579
PROPOSITION DOING THE

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.447
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SO.

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.316
THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:45.117
TO CHANGE THOSE AND THE

00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:47.119
MANDATORY DEPOSITS ARE THE VAST

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.554
MAJORITY. OF WHAT IS IN THE

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.089
BSA. WHEN IT COMES TO DATE

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.591
DISCRETIONARY DEPOSITS

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:53.559
CERTAINLY IT'S THE

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.627
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION BACK.

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:56.161
YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:57.629
CONTINUE TO FILL UP THE

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.197
MANDATORY SIDE TO ITS MAXIMUM

00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:00.399
OUT AND- CERTAINLY THE

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:01.533
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.068
TENSION OF TOPPINGS OF THOSE

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.870
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS ABSENT SOME

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:08.540
TYPE OF. EMERGENCY SO FOR

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:09.174
SPEAKING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.143
DON'T YOU SPELL AS CHANGING

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:13.412
THAT PERSPECTIVE IN ANY AND

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.213
THAT THAT THOSE PROVISIONS AND

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:15.847
ANY SIGNIFICANT RESPECT BUT YOU

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:18.617
UNDERSTAND MY CONCERN. THAT

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:21.587
THOSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:25.357
WOULD NO LONGER EXIST IF WE

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:29.628
MOVE THAT MONEY OUT OF THE DAY.

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.997
YES CERTAINLY WELL. IN YOU'RE

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:32.598
TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:33.932
DISCRETIONARY MONEY YES. YES

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.200
AND IT SAYS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:36.134
IT'S IN THE BSA AS A

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:37.970
DISCRETIONARY AMOUNT SO YOU

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.338
KNOW IT IT IS SUBJECT. IT IS

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.372
ONLY THE BSA'S AND YOU CREATION

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:41.840
SO I THINK JUST NO PROPOSITION

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:42.374
TWO WAS PASSED IN TWENTY

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.942
FOURTEEN. WE ARE CERTAINLY

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.477
TREATING ALL THOSE FUNDS

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:48.046
MANDATORY AND DISCRETIONARY AS

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:49.247
YOU KNOW FOR A SOME TYPE OF

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:51.683
BUDGETARY. EMERGENCY BUT

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.951
CERTAINLY IF THE LEGISLATURE

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:57.556
WERE TO MOVE THE DISCRETIONARY.

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:58.123
FUNDS TO ANY OTHER FINE DAD

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.694
THERE WOULD BE. WE DIFFERENT.

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.562
YES WELL I WOULD NEVER PROBLEM

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.396
WITH IT IF THE STATUTORY

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:06.231
PROVISIONS EXISTED ON THE PDSA

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:06.865

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.034
HAVE A PROBLEM. THANK YOU

STATE WAS IN THE WRONG THE END

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.921
OF FIGHTING AGAINST SPENDING

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.168
THIS BILL WOULD DO IS

THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY GAP

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:34.886
THIS TAX IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

IN THE LAST AT FISCAL YEAR IT'S

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:52.504
A HALF YEAR BUT AN ANNUALIZED

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.738
BASIS WOULD RATE. I WOULD HAVE

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:54.906
AN IMPACT OF TWO POINT FOUR

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.675
BILLION DOLLARS IT'S BASED ON A

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.711
CUMULATIVE ENROLLMENT BASED ON

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:00.912
THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN YEAR

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:01.780

COMMITTEE. MISTER BROOKS. THANK

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:16.494
YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK WE

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:17.729
ALL UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:18.263
THIS WHICH IS TO DRAW DOWN

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:21.099
FEDERAL. BUT THE WAY THAT I'M

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.700
READING IT THEY'LL ALSO CREATED

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:23.802
UNREIMBURSED TAX BURDEN OF

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.336
DEPENDING DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:26.938
FIGURES USE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:29.140
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:33.011
YEAR THAT WILL BE PAID BY.

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.712
ENROLLEES IN PRIVATE HEALTH

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:36.114
INSURANCE PLANS OTHER THAN THE

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.148
MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:38.817
WE'RE TRYING T TAX AND I

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:39.984
PERSONALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:40.585
THAT I WAS UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.954
RIGHT AND THE SECOND QUESTION

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:45.890
IS IN A WHY WHY DID THAT

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:46.458
OCCURRED WORK WE DO ABOUT IT

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:47.092
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS NOT THE

00:28:47.158 --> 00:28:51.062
INTENT. CHECK A ONE APARTMENT

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.230
FINANCE SO YOU ARE CORRECT

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.032
THERE WILL BE A TAX LIABILITY

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:54.766
FOR HEALTH PLANS ON THE

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.334
COMMERCIAL LIVES. IN FISCAL

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.269
YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THAT IS

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.671
APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN POINT SIX

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:01.673
MILLION DOLLARS. HIGH VERY HIGH

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:04.142
LEVEL. IN DESIGNING THIS TAX.

00:29:04.209 --> 00:29:07.879
YOU HAVE TO ME TO FEDERAL TESTS

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:08.446
ONE OF WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:09.581
THERE'S NO HOLD HARMLESS FOR

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:12.150
ALL OF THE- MANAGED CARE

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:13.618
ORGANIZATIONS. TO THE EXTENT

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.019
POSSIBLE WE TRIED. WITH THE-

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.488
TAX LIABILITY FOR THESE PLANS

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:17.755
ON THEIR COMMERCIALIZED BUT

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:19.324
BECAUSE WE COULD NOT. MAKE THE

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.226
TAX ZERO FOR THOSE SPECIFIC

00:29:21.292 --> 00:29:22.894
LIVES THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:23.695
WHERE THESE PLANS WILL HAVE.

00:29:23.761 --> 00:29:25.597
SOME TAX LIABILITY. AFTER

00:29:25.663 --> 00:29:28.566
THEY'VE BEEN REIMBURSED WITH

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:29.134
THEIR FEDERAL FUNDS IN THEIR

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.102
MANAGED CARE CAPITATION RATES.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.504
SO WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.471
SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.274
AUTHORIZED THE MCO TAX AND THE

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.742
WAY THAT WE SOLVED IT DOWN WAS

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:40.211
WE CHANGED. OUR CORPORATE TAX

00:29:40.278 --> 00:29:42.180
CODE IN THE STATE. TO CREATE AN

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.414
OFFSETTING YOU KNOW ROUGHLY

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:46.284
OFFSETTING. A FINANCIAL BENEFIT

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:47.285
FOR THE COMPANY IS THAT WE'RE

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:49.287
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IN AN

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.488
EFFORT TO TRY AND PREVENT THOSE

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:53.124
COSTS FROM BEING PASSED ON TO

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:53.725
THEIR RATE PAYERS WHY HAVE WE

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:57.562
NOT DONE THAT THIS TIME. IN

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:58.830
TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITY

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.232
COMPARATIVELY LAST MCO TEXAS

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:02.667
MCO TAX ONLY HAS TWO TAXING

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.736
TEARS. OF THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.204
MILLION DOLLARS IS A TAX

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.772
LIABILITY FOR THOSE PLANS BUT

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.507
IN TERMS OF THE- ACTUAL IMPACT

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:12.177
ON BENEFICIARIES WE ESTIMATE

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:13.144
THAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A FIVE

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.380
TO. TEN CENT. INCREASE ON THEIR

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:18.249
MONTHLY PREMIUMS. AND SO I

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:20.418
THINK WE'VE MINIMIZE THAT TAX

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.586
LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.887
POSSIBLE USING THE NCO

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.088
STRUCTURE AND I THINK AT THIS

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.323
POINT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.724
ADDITIONAL TAX CONFORMITY

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.059
CHANGES THAT WERE INCLUDING THE

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:29.494
LAST. PROPOSAL SURE I

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.262
UNDERSTAND I JUST MY POINT IS

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.730
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR US

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:33.665
TO DO SOMETHING

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.967
CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE MCO

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:37.168
TAX THE SAME WAY WE DID LAST

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:38.436
TIME WE AUTHORIZED. IN AN

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:43.074
EFFORT TO HOLD. TOLD RATE

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:43.575
PAYERS HARMLESS AND I'M

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:44.175
DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T DO

00:30:44.242 --> 00:30:48.012
THAT. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER.

MONTH STIPEND FOR THE HEALTH

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:55.052

AFFORDABILITY IN THE

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:56.854

THOSE MEMBERS ARE FACED WITH SO

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.261
BASED ON THE RATES THAT CALPERS

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:05.129
ADOPTS FOR THE VARIOUS HEALTH

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.764
PLANS THAT STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.966
ACCESS TO. THIS STIPEND

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.701
ESSENTIALLY IS TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.503
FACT THAT THERE ARE REAL

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.106
IMPACTS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. BASED

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:16.874
ON THE RATES AND THE INCREASES

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:17.909
THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE YEAR

OVER YEAR FOR HEALTH PLANS AND

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.747
SO THIS. MODEL OR THIS PROPOSAL

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.515
REALLY IS TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.617
AFFORDABILITY IN THE IMPACT OF

THAT THOSE HEALTH CARE PREMIUM

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.787
INCREASES THAT ARE THAT THOSE

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.923
MEMBERS SEE ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:32.990
ONCE THOSE RATES ARE ADOPTED

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:35.560
AND SO IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO RIGHT

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:38.262
SIZE AND OFFSET SOME OF THE

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.497
INCREASED COST THAT THE

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:41.465
EMPLOYEES SEE AS A RESULT OF.

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.968
WHAT CALPERS BOARD ULTIMATELY

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.670
ADOPTS FOR THOSE RATES IN THOSE

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:47.572
PLANS OKAY BUT THESE ARE THESE

RATES HAVE GONE UP FOR ALL OF

00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:50.775
THE PERS PLANS RIGHT SO IT IS

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:55.913
JUST A SMALL. FRACTION OF THE

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.514
BARGAINING UNITS THAT WERE ARE

00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:03.988
TING. OPPOSITION TO REACH ONE

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:04.922
OF FOR EVERYBODY SO I JUST GOT

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.691
MY ATTENTION WHY THOSE

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:07.258
BARGAINING UNITS AND NOT THE

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:09.827

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.462
BARGAINING UNITS AGAIN IT COMES

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.763
DOWN A PRIORITIZATION OF WHAT

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.598
THOSE BARGAINING UNITS WANT TO

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:14.432
NEGOTIATE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:15.566
MEMBERS AND THOSE PRIORITIES

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:16.968
BUT IT ALSO COMES DOWN TO

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:18.636
TIMING IN TERMS OF. WHEN THOSE

00:37:18.703 --> 00:37:19.770

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.576

RESOLUTION AND THAT TENTATIVE

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.315
AGREEMENT FOR THOSE GROUPS
