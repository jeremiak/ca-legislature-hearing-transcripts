00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.484

VERY BEGINNING WE- WHAT. WHAT'S

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:37.889
THE CURRENT PROBLEM WHERE. IS

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.924

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.192
THEY'RE DOING NOW IF ANYTHING

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.161
ALL YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW.

I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR YOUR

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.838
BAIL- I'M WILLING TO BET THEY

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.573
DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY AT

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.676
THIS TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE

00:32:58.743 --> 00:32:59.444
YOU'RE SO FAR BEHIND. WHAT OTHER

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.080
ISSUES SUCH AS GETTING PEOPLE

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.449
WHO HAVE GUNS THAT ARE ILLEGAL.

00:33:04.515 --> 00:33:06.617
AND GETTING TO THEM AND PRESENT

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:09.654
AND- PUTTING THOSE GUNS IN THEIR

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:12.223
POSSESSION. SO IF I WERE YOU MR

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.960
AUTHOR- I WOULD WORK WITH THE

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:19.764
DEPARTMENT- TO SEE HOW YOU VIEW

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:22.867
YOUR BILL CAN BE MODIFIED OR

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:27.305
PERHAPS THERE'S A BUDGET ASK YOU-COULD HAVE. THOUGHT BECAUSE THIS

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:31.175
IS JYJ THERE ARE MORE GUN STORES

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:34.912
THAN MCDONALD'S- SO THIS IS A

00:33:34.979 --> 00:33:37.081
HUGE COMMITMENT OF TIME AND

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:41.152
MONEY. AND OF- I THINK YOU'VE

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:43.020

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:45.056
WE'RE ONLY GOING TO VOTE ON THE

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:47.892

00:33:47.959 --> 00:33:51.295
THAT DEPARTMENT WILL BE GREAT.

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.331

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:02.206
BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND- MAKING

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:03.708
