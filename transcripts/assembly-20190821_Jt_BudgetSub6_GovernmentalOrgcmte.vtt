BOOKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:01.238
MATERIALS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:03.074
FIGURE THE PIE CHART IN FRONT

SCHOOLS. THEY GENERALLY USE

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:08.179
MOST OF THEIR LOTTERY FINDINGS

COMMUNITY COLLEGES AFTER YOU

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.087
SET ASIDE THE- THE MANDATORY

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.254
KIND OF SPENDING ANY LOOK AT

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.689
THEIR DISCRETIONARY PORTION.

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:20.257
THEY GENERALLY USE THAT FOR

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:28.165
UNIVERSITIES THEY GENERALLY

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.433
ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO THEIR

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.169
CAMPUSES THE CSU DOES RETAIN

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:34.105
ABOUT 25% OF THE FUNDING FOR

00:39:34.171 --> 00:39:36.841
SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES. WHEN

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:37.475
IT GOES TO THE CAMPUS IS THE

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.876
CAMPUSES TEND TO USE THE

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:41.612
FUNDING FOR VARIOUS PRIORITIES

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.047
WHICH INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.949
SUPPORT TO ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS

PURCHASING LIBRARY MATERIALS.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:53.524
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:55.693
YOUR HAND OUT WE DID TALK ABOUT

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.594
YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF MONEY

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.129
OF BILLION THE OVER BILLION

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:59.797
DOLLARS GOING TO EDUCATION

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:00.631
HOWEVER ONE OF THINGS THAT WE

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:01.532
DID WANT TO BRING TO YOUR

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.833
ATTENTION IS THAT. A LOTTERY

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.368
FUNDS DO REPRESENT A SMALL

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:07.972
SHARE OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:08.472
FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:09.140
EDUCATION ESSENTIALLY LESS THAN

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.575
2% AND IF YOUR BEFORE YOU

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.177
PROVIDE THAT BREAK DOWN BY

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:15.112
ENTITY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:17.548
RANGES FROM 005% FOR YOU SEE TO

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.484
ABOUT ONE POINT. SEVEN CENTS.

00:40:20.551 --> 00:40:23.387
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IF YOU

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:24.021
TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR HAND

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.556
OUT. THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTORS

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:27.458
THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:29.126
THAT'S GENERATED FOR EDUCATION.

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:31.295
AND HERE WE LAY OUT ABOUT SEVEN

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:33.430
OF THE MAJOR FACTORS. THAT CAN

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.633
IMPACT THAT. THE FIRST FACTOR

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:36.901
RELATES TO THE TYPES AND

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.569
VARIETY OF GAMES THAT ARE

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.172
OFFERED. AND THAT REALLY.

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.940
APPEALS TO DIFFERENT

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:45.509
DEMOGRAPHICS OF. CUSTOMERS AND

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.977
SO THIS WOULD IMPACT WHETHER

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.279
AND- WHETHER OR NOT NEW

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:50.214
CUSTOMERS WERE ACQUIRED AS WELL

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.316
AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:52.917
EXISTING CUSTOMERS WOULD PLAY

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:55.553
THE GAMES. THE SECOND FACTOR

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:56.554
RELATES TO PUT HIS STRUCTURE

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.788
AND PRIZE AMOUNTS AND SIMILARLY

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:58.756
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO

00:40:58.823 --> 00:40:59.657
APPEAL TO DIFFERENT

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:01.759
DEMOGRAPHICS OF CUSTOMERS. AND

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.127
CUSTOMER WILLINGNESS WILL

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.930
REALLY THAN DEPEND ON HOW

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:08.165
ATTRACTIVE THEY FIND THE PRICE.

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:09.867
THE THIRD FACTOR IS THE EASE OF

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.335
PURCHASING HOW EASY IS IT FOR

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.970
INDIVIDUALS TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.905
THESE PRODUCTS AND SO THAT WILL

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:15.873
THEN DICTATE CUSTOMER

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.375
WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE THE

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:18.876
PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:19.443
FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY DO

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.613
SELL. THE FOUR AFTER IS RELATED

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.014
TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PLAYER

00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:26.016
EXPERIENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.185
EASY IS IT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.720
WHO WINS TO THEN GET THEIR PAY

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:32.022
OUT. ESSENTIALLY THIS SIMILARLY

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:34.124
WOULD IMPACT THEIR WILLINGNESS

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:34.592
TO PLAY A GAME AND THE

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.927
FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY PLAY.

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:38.829
THE FACTOR RELATES TO THE

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:41.398
AMOUNT SPENT ON MARKETING. THE

00:41:41.465 --> 00:41:42.967
AMOUNT THAT SPENT ON MARKETING

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:44.902
CERTAINLY CAN INCREASE PUBLIC

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.437
AWARENESS AND THEREBY GENERATE

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:48.539
ADDITIONAL SALES A MORE IS MORE

00:41:48.606 --> 00:41:49.707
PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN PREVENT.

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:52.309
A PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS HOWEVER

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.011
AT SOME POINT THERE IS A

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.746
THRESHOLD THAT IS REACHED WHERE

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:57.414
ANY ADDITIONAL MONIES THAT

00:41:57.481 --> 00:41:59.583
POINT IN MAY NO LONGER ACQUIRE.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.118
NEW CUSTOMERS OR MAY NOT

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.354
GENERATE ADDITIONAL SALES AT

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.689
THE SAME RATE THAT IT HAD DONE

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:09.493
SO IN THE PAST. THE SIXTH ISSUE

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.661
RELATES TO A TELLER INCENTIVES

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.829
THAT RETAILERS HAVE INCENTIVES

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:13.998
AND THE VERY BY LOTTERY PRODUCT

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.299
BUT THAT WILL REALLY KIND OF

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:18.302
DETERMINE HOW WILLING RETAILERS

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:18.869
ARE TO OFFER THE PRODUCTS AS

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.971
WELL AS TO PROMOTE THEM. THE

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.740
FINAL FACTOR THIS PAGE IT

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:25.442
RELATES TO RESPONSIBLE AND

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.710
PROBLEM GAMING PROVISIONS THIS

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:28.245
IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.481
STATE AND THE COMMISSION HAVE

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:33.150
BEEN KIND OF REALLY. FORCEFUL

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.019
AND THINK THAT IT IS A PRIORITY

00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.787
BUT THIS WILL THAT IMPACT SOME

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:37.588
OF THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.356
DISCUSS THE FOR EXAMPLE HOW

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:41.592
EASY IT IS FOR INDIVIDUAL TO IS

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:44.929
TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS. SO IF YOU

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:45.863
TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.098
OUT IN TOTAL THESE FACTORS

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.833
REALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT THAT'S

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.135
GENERATED FOR EDUCATION IN TWO

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:53.203
WAYS ONE IS THAT IT CAN

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.138
INCREASE THE TOTAL POT THE

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.005
TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.941
COMING IN. THE SECOND WAY THAT

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.309
IT CAN CREE SAID IS THAT THE

00:42:58.375 --> 00:42:59.209
TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE MAY NOT

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:01.111
CHANGE. THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:02.846
DISTRIBUTION CAN INCREASE SO

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.348
FOR EXAMPLE YOU BRING DOWN YOUR

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:07.584
COSTS BUT REVENUES ARE THE SAME.

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:08.919
SO THEN IF YOU TURN TO THE

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.054
FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.022
PAGE TEN. WE WERE ASKED TO

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:13.457
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:14.992
AND KIND OF COMPARISON TO OTHER

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.827
STATES. WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.696
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.365
KEY FACTORS POLICY OPERATIONAL

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.599
ARE FACTORS IN MIND AS YOU'RE

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.634
THINKING ABOUT THESE

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.235
COMPARISONS. SO AS AN EXAMPLE

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.104
CALIFORNIA MAY NOT OFFER THE

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:29.506
SAME GAMES. AS OTHER STATES.

00:43:29.573 --> 00:43:30.874
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.343
CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:33.911
RESPONSIBLE GAMING MAY MEAN

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:36.146
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE AS

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.214
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MARKETING

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.183
PRODUCTS AS OTHER STATES. ARE

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:41.518
THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE A

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:41.952
FEW FACTORS FOR YOUR

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:47.691
CONSIDERATION. SOME TWO

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:48.258
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:48.859
THAT'S THE WHERE THESE FACTORS

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:49.660
ARE ARE GOING AT. IT THE DATA

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.428
POLLS FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:51.929
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DATA.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:54.465
APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR STATES

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:55.399
AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.368
OFFER A LOTTERY PRODUCTS. AND

00:43:57.434 --> 00:43:59.103
SO OUR FIRST METRIC COMPARES

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:01.138
SALES TO RETAILERS. AND THE

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.506
RELATED TO THIS CALIFORNIA

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.308
AVERAGED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.110
THOUSAND IN SALES PER RETAILER.

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.544
ABOUT TWENTY TWO STATES AND THE

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.046
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AVERAGE

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:11.215
HIGHER AMOUNTS WITH THE HIGHEST

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:12.316
AVERAGING ABOUT ONE MILLION

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:15.519
DOLLARS PER RETAILER. THE

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:16.086
SECOND FACTOR LOOKS AT SALES

00:44:16.153 --> 00:44:18.222
AND POPULATION. CALIFORNIA

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.757
AVERAGED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:20.858
SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.292
CALIFORNIAN OR NEARLY TWO

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.560
HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:24.762
CALIFORNIA OVER THE AGE OF

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:28.565
EIGHTEEN. ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:29.099
STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:32.002
CALIFORNIA AVERAGE HIGHER SALES.

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:33.303
THE THIRD FACTOR THEN LOOKS AT

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.541
PRIZES AND SALES ABOUT 64% OF

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:38.776
CALIFORNIA'S LOTTERY SALES

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:39.977
REVENUES ARE GENERATE ARE

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.179
RETURNED AS PRIZES ABOUT TWELVE

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.347
STATES RETURNED A GREATER

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.916
PROPORTION WITH HIGHS REACHING

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:49.586
ABOUT 74% THE FOURTH COMPARATOR

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:51.622
IS ABOUT HOW FUNDING IS USED IN

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:52.990
OTHER STATES SIMILAR TO

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.525
CALIFORNIA AND THERE ABOUT TWO

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:55.726
THIRDS OF THE LOTTERY'S THAT

00:44:55.793 --> 00:44:56.894
ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING TO

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.029
EDUCATION PURPOSES. OTHER

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:00.798
LOTTERIES ALSO DO FIND VARIOUS

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.199
OTHER BENEFICIARIES ARE

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.967
PROGRAMS INCLUDING PROBLEM

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.470
GAMING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.572
RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.940
PURPOSES AND STATE AND LOCAL

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:12.076
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS. THE FINAL

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:14.111
FACTOR ON THIS LIST LOOKS AT

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:15.079
BENEFICIARIES ARE THEY NOT

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:16.246
GOING TO BENEFITS YEARS

00:45:16.313 --> 00:45:18.348
COMPARED TO SALES AND ON THAT

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.884
ABOUT 24% OF CALIFORNIA'S

LOTTERY COMMISSION

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:21.865
SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIES THE RULE

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:22.632
THAT FINANCE TYPICALLY PAY

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:26.169
PLAYS FOR AN ENTITY. BUT WE

00:58:26.236 --> 00:58:28.037
HAVE A COUPLE REPRESENTATIVES

YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A COUPLE

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:46.222
QUESTIONS KIND OF RELATING TO

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.790
THE CORE TOPIC THAT I'M

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.292
CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS THAT

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:52.028
WHEN THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:52.595
APPROVED THE CREATION OF A

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:55.265
STATE LOTTERY IT WAS WITH THE

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.332
UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THE

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:57.967
PROCEEDS FROM THE LOTTERY WOULD

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.102
GO TO EDUCATION AND I THINK

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:03.673
WE'RE ALL. INTERESTED IN MAKING

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:04.307
SURE THAT WERE FOR FILLING THAT

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:04.908
PROMISE AND I'M SURE THAT YOU

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:07.677
ARE TO. THE THING THAT'S

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:09.112
SUPPOSED TO CONSTRUED TO ME IS

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.880
WHAT THE LA RAISED IN THEIR

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:12.916
ANALYSIS WHICH IS THAT. IN THE

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.550
LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN.

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.452
REVENUE FROM THE LOTTERY MORE

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.154
THAN DOUBLE. AND YET THE

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.555
REVENUE THAT WE ARE

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.790
CONTRIBUTING TO EDUCATION IS A

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.325
PORTION OF LOTTERY SALES HAS

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:25.028
DECLINED FROM 34% TO LESS THAN

00:59:25.094 --> 00:59:31.668
24% SO WHY IS THAT. THANK YOU

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:32.268
FOR YOUR QUESTION. IT'S A BIT

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:37.407
OF A. A TRICKY PICTURE WHEN YOU

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.242
LOOK AT JUST THE PERCENTAGES

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.944
AND WHAT WE FOUND HELPFUL IN

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.879
THIS ANALYSIS OR IS TO LOOK AT

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.480
THE ABSOLUTE DOLLARS ARE DRIVEN

00:59:44.547 --> 00:59:45.415
TO EDUCATION BECAUSE OUR

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:47.717
MISSION AS LAID OUT IN STATUTE

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:48.284
IS TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.119
FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. THE

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.754
CHANGES MADE LEGISLATURE TEN

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.456
YEARS AGO IN AB ONE FORTY TO

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.924
ALLOW FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.693
THE PRIZE. AND THERE'S A TIGHT

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:57.894
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICES AND

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.463
SALES. SO IN EFFECT BY MAKING

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.932
MORE ATTRACTIVE PRIZES. THE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.000
LOTTERY'S BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:08.805
THE WHOLE PIE. AND BY DOING SO

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:09.973
MORE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.442
EDUCATION OKAY I WAS INTERESTED

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:13.776
THAT PARTY OR TESTIMONY BECAUSE

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.111
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. ABSENT

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:20.249
THE DROPPING OF THAT CAPTAIN AB

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:22.118
ONE FORTY TWO YOU BELIEVE THAT

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:22.752
OVERALL LOTTERY REVENUE WILL BE

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:26.589
LOWER BUT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:27.824
SAME QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.192
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:31.227
OF DOLLARS OF PHYSICAL DOLLARS

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.396
THAT WE HAND OVER TO EDUCATION.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:36.332
ARE HIGHER NOW THAN IF WE HAD

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:40.136
RETAINED THAT 34% MINIMUM IN AB

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:40.770
ONE FORTY TWO THE SHORT ANSWER

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.839
IS YES. MOST OF THE SALES ARE

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.140
DRIVEN BY SCRATCHERS AND WE

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.708
WILL OFFER A VARIETY OF

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:46.909
DIFFERENT SCRATCHER PRODUCTS

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.611
AND PRICE LEVELS BUT IN

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:49.912
ADDITION AS I MENTIONED IN MY

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.881
TESTIMONY EARLIER SIR. WE'VE

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.616
SEEN THAT IN WHAT WE CALL THE

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:54.350
PARA MUTUAL GAMES THE DRAW

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:57.320
GAMES MAKE UP MEGA MILLIONS OR

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.655
POWERBALL THAT WHEN THERE ARE.

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.457
JACKPOTS THAT ARE VERY LARGE

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.558
WHICH WE CAN'T NECESSARILY

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.927
PREDICT THAN THAT ATTRACTS MORE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.596
PLAYERS IN THAT DRIVE SALES SO

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.798
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE FROM YEAR TO

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.266
YEAR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION TO

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.467
SOME DEGREE BECAUSE WILL HAVE A

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.069
JACKPOT OF SAY A BILLION

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.570
DOLLARS PEOPLE ARE EXCITED BY

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.039
THAT AND THEY WANT TO PLAY WE

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:19.042
HAVE THUS MORE SALES. SO WHAT

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.309
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.444
FLEXIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.547
GRANTED TEN YEARS AGO IS. OFFER

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.249
MORE ATTRACTIVE PRIZES

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:30.019
ESPECIALLY SCRATCHERS. AND

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:30.620
THAT'LL LABELS US TO HAVE MORE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:35.158
SALES AND MORE REVENUE. OKAY

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:36.025
WELL I CONSIDER ME EXTREMELY

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.093
SKEPTICAL ON THAT CLAIM AND IF

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.361
YOU HAVE SOME SOME DATA THAT

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:39.395
BACKS IT UP I WOULD BE VERY

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.997
INTERESTED IN READING IT. I

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:41.731
WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:44.567
HAVING A LARGER. GRAND PRIZE.

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.535
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:46.669
MARKET AROUND IT THAT WILL

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.271
DRIVE SALES REVENUE TO THE

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.972
LOTTERY BUT- IF YOU'RE TALKING

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.808
ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.177
REVENUE THAT GOES TO THE PRIZE

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.912
POOL. I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.080
PLAYING LOTTERY ARE PAYING

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.147
ATTENTION TO THE MATH BECAUSE

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.116
OF THEIR WORK HONESTLY IF

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:00.983
THAT'S WHAT WAS DRIVING THEIR

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:01.617
PURCHASE DECISION THEY WOULDN'T

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:04.720
BE PLAYING THE LOTTERY. SO I

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:05.988
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:06.989
WOULDN'T BE BETTER OFF FROM AN

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:10.560
EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:13.062
REINSTITUTING THAT THIRTY FOUR

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:16.032
PERCENT. A CAP THAT YOU BE. THE

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:22.638
ONE. FORTY ONE FORTY TWO WAS I

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:23.773
WAS JUST INSTITUTED AN I. ONE

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.108
LAST QUESTION AND IT'S IT GOES

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:26.409
TO ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:27.977
ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN TRENDING

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.345
RECENTLY AND WITHIN THE LOTTERY

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.279
AND THAT'S THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:32.181
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.750
PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL LOTTERY

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:37.186
REVENUE ONE WOULD EXPECT OUT AS

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.055
REVENUE ROSE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:41.224
COSTS WILL ALSO GROW BUT AS A

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.425
PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL SALES IT

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.460
WILL DECLINE BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.661
AMORTIZING YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:46.429
EXPENSES. A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.798
TICKETS SOLD BUT THAT IN FACT

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.099
IS NOT WHAT BEEN WHAT HAS

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:50.700
HAPPENED A WITH JENNER'S IN

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.369
FACT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:58.040
BEEN VERY STEADY AT AROUND 12%

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:58.674
OF. THE NEW AND I JUST WONDERED

01:02:58.741 --> 01:02:59.242
WHY THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.777
WHAT I WOULD EXPECT. WELL

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:02.778
YOU'RE RIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:03.846
COSTS HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY FLAT

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:06.849
AROUND 12% AS YOU INDICATE.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:07.483
THOSE COSTS AS I INDICATED IN

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.551
MY TESTIMONY ARE DIVIDED

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.185
AMONGST WHAT WE PAY OUR TWENTY

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:09.785
THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS WHAT

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:10.353
WE PAY OUR VENDORS AND ALSO

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:11.087
OVERHEAD AND AS I INDICATED

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.722
ALSO DURING MY TESTIMONY ARE

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.357
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.458
RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:17.193
ACTUALLY BEEN BELOW WHAT'S BEEN

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.296
THAT THE EFFECTIVE CAP. AND WE

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:20.863
SAID THE DIFFERENCE BACK TO

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:23.232
SCHOOLS IN. IN TERMS OF

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.901
EDUCATION FUNDING I WOULD SAY

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.670
THAT. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.839
DATA REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WE

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:30.840
HAVE TO PAY THE RETAILERS WE

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:34.043
HAVE TO BE THE VENDORS AND- TO

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.644
A LARGE DEGREE THAT'S BASED ON

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.812
A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WE SELL.

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:37.513
SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:38.347
THERE'S ALSO A LARGE NO.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:38.981
EXPENSES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:41.284
VOLUME OF SALES. AND THOSE ARE

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.785
THE ONES THAT I WOULD EXPECT TO

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:43.786
DECLINE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:45.388
SEE THAT THE CLIENT AND- YOU

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.156
KNOW AS A LEGISLATOR WHEN YOU

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.057
SAY. WHAT WE'RE STILL UNDER THE

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:50.159
CAP THAT MEANS TO ME WILL ME WE

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.027
LOOK AT LOWERING THE CAP

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.662
BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:53.629
SEVEN CENTER POSITION NEEDS

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:54.797
THAT TO OCCUR THERE. BUT I MEAN

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.732
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ON

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:57.366
THE SAME TEAM HERE WANT TO MAKE

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.568
SURE THAT WE- WE FOR. OUR

01:03:58.634 --> 01:03:59.669
PROBLEM TO THE VOTERS OF

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:02.939
NUMBER OF DOLLARS WE'RE GETTING

TO EDUCATION I JUST HAVE GRAVE

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.342
CONCERNS. THAT THERE ISN'T A

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:11.280
BETTER WAY OF GOING ABOUT THIS.

EXPLAINING THE FULL PICTURE OF

LOTTERY TICKETS OR FROM TAXES

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.657
WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:36.692
FUNDING AS YOU KNOW SIR THERE

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:37.927
ARE MANY TENS OF BILLIONS

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.495
DOLLARS THAT SUPPORT ALL THE

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.098
DIFFERENT EDUCATION SEGMENTS.

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:45.868
AND AS THE ELLIE EXPLAINED.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:46.369
LOTTERY FUNDING AMOUNTS

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.436
DEPENDING ON WHICH SIGNAL

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.237
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:48.838
ONE AND A HALF TO TWO PERCENT.

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:49.338
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:50.773
DEPENDING. WE'RE PROUD OF THE

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.941
FACT THAT LOTTERY DOLLAR

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.109
SUPPORT EDUCATION EVERYWHERE

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:53.843
THERE ARE STUDENTS IN

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.545
CALIFORNIA. FROM K. FOURTEEN

CORRECTIONS. IT DOES AVERAGE

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.251
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.919
DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND IT'S

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.421
ALWAYS BEEN A FRACTION OF THE

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:06.021
FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS GET FROM

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:08.824
THE STATE. WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.559
AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:11.927
COMMENTS IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.028
THAT CAN ACTUALLY BENEFIT

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:14.296
STUDENTS IS HIGHLIGHT THOSE

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:20.536
PROGRAMS. WE'RE NOT HERE.

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:21.904
DOLLARS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.205
FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS THAT

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:25.040
STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM. AND WE

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.242
HAVE WORK TO DO TO TELL THAT

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.810
STORY AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.111
THE VISION THAT I HAVE GOING

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.212
FORWARD IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.947
EDUCATE CALIFORNIA EXCUSE ME

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.350
EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS MORE ABOUT

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.951
WHAT LOTTERY DOLLARS ARE DOING

01:07:36.018 --> 01:07:38.554
IN THEIR SCHOOLS. WE KNOW THAT

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:39.155
THERE'S SOME GOOD STORIES OUT

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:39.755
THERE AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.357
ON MYSELF. YOU RAISE A GOOD

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.292
POINT AND A VERY GOOD QUESTION

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:43.926
THAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.161
ONE SIR REGARDING WHAT HAPPENS

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:46.862
OTHER STATES. WE KNOW THAT

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:49.198
OTHER STATES. SOME OTHER STATES

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.167
DO NOT HAVE THE SAME CAP ON

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.802
PRICES THAT CALIFORNIA HAD WON

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:54.236
THE LOTTERY ACT WAS INSTITUTED

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:56.071
THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT'S THE

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:58.374
THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THE 50%

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:00.042
FIFTY PERCENT. THE 50% CAP ON

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.544
PRICES WAS PARTY REGIONAL WATER

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.980
REACT. AND CALIFORNIA WAS ONE

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:07.116
OF A SMALL NUMBER STATES IT HAD

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.350
SUCH CAP OTHER STATES DID NOT

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.386
HAVE THAT CAP. ON PRICES. AND

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:12.388
SO. OUR EXPERIENCE THE TEN

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.490
YEARS OF DATA WE HAVE SINCE AB

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:15.391
ONE FORTY TWO WAS PASSED HAVE

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.725
SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU. HAVE A

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.027
LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY JUST A

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:20.463
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY. TO

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:21.897
MAKE THE PRICES MORE ATTRACTIVE

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.300
YOU CAN REALLY DRIVE SALES. AND

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:24.834
WE'VE SEEN THAT RESULT IN

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.369
INCREASED DOLLARS CHANGE THAT

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:28.771
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:31.574
VOTERS ARE. BY A STATUE TO THE

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.011
LEGISLATURE. IT WILL BE THAT

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:36.946
THE LEGISLATURE OR CAN BE DONE

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:37.880
BY THE VOTERS IT HAS TO FURTHER

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:38.948
ACCORDING TO THE LOTTERY ACCESS

01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:39.515
TO FOR THE PURPOSES. OF THE

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.182
LOTTERY MAXIMIZING SUPPLEMENTAL

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.283
FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION.

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.119
AND A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:44.787
WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:45.821
SO THOSE I DON'T DO AS THE

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:47.923
ELLIE ON A SECOND SO THE PRICES

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:49.091
SO. IN PLAIN ENGLISH TO FOLLOW

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:50.459
UP ON ON MISTER OBERNOLTE.

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:51.660
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE THAT THE

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:54.330
PLAYER. IS MAKING A DECISION

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:55.798
HEY I'M GONNA BUY EXTRA TICKET

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.733
CITY XML SCRATCHER OR DO THE-

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.068
POWER WHATEVER YOU CALL THE

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.870
BALL NUMBERS. BECAUSE THERE

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:02.505
OUGHT. THEY THINK THAT THEY

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:03.038
HAVE THE BETTER CHANCE OF

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.139
WINNING BUT- THE ODDS ARE

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:06.475
STILL. STACKED AGAINST YOU

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.610
THAT. IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:09.645
FAVORABLE TO OUR- OUR PUBLIC

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.447
EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE THOSE

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:19.388
PLAYERS REALLY. GOING TO. NOT.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:20.422
THEY PARTICIPATE. IN THE

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:21.457
EFFORT. WILL FUNDAMENTALLY SIR

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.057
WERE A SALES ORGANIZATION AND

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:22.658
THE CHALLENGE IS ALWAYS BEEN

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.826
HOW DO YOU FIND A WAY TO. IN A

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:26.595
RESPONSIBLE WAY. DRIVE SALES.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.297
AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN THE

01:09:28.364 --> 01:09:29.532
TRICK IN THE CHALLENGE WE COME

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.000
UP WITH. INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:34.336
WITH PRODUCTS USING A LICENSING

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:35.170
FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.305
AS MONOPOLY WHICH IS VERY

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.774
POPULAR. WE DO OTHER THINGS TO

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.075
FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.477
ATTRACTIVE BUT THERE'S- A

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:42.978
RESEARCH AND PLANNING ELEMENT

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.013
THAT GOES INTO ALL OF OUR

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:45.481
PRODUCTS TO DETERMINE. WHETHER

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.715
THOSE ARE REALLY MAKING MONEY

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:47.950
WHETHER THOSE ARE EFFECTIVE OR

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.785
NOT. THE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.921
WE RETIRE AND WE'RE ALWAYS

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:52.988
LOOKING FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.256
TO PACKAGE OUR PRODUCTS IN SUCH

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.724
A WAY SO THAT. PEOPLE ARE

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.393
INCENTIVIZED TO PLAY. IT'S

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:59.028
ENTERTAINMENT AS WE'VE SEEN

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.262
WITH THE OTHER GAMING INDUSTRY

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.165
SEGMENTS. THE POINT IS TO

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.500
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:05.768
PEOPLE TO USE. OF THEIR MONEY

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.136
IN WAYS THAT THEY FIND

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:08.771
INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:10.172
AND IN OUR CASE IN THE STATE

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.474
LOTTERIES CASE WERE ABLE TO.

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.211
USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS TO

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:16.845
BENEFIT THE KIDS IN SCHOOLS AND

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:20.849
OTHER STUDENTS. AND THEN THE LA

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:24.420
OF ANY INSIGHT FROM OTHER

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:27.256
STATES OTHER COMMUNITIES WE

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.457
HAVEN'T DONE A ROBUST ANALYSIS

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:29.425
COMPARING CALIFORNIA TO OTHER

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.926
STATES I THINK ON THE FINAL

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.428
PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE DO A

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:35.664
LAY OUT SOME COMPARATORS AND IN

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:38.167
TERMS OF SOME OBSERVATIONS.

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:41.637
THAT WE OWE IT. OF A COMPARISON

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:42.438
WITH OTHER STATES ONE OF THINGS

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.339
THAT WE DID TALK ABOUT IS THAT

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:43.973
IT IS IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.175
INTO KEEPING IN MIND TO SOME OF

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.310
THESE OTHER FACTORS. IN THESE

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.379
ARE THINGS THAT I THINK THE

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:52.281
LOTTERY IS CLEARLY THINKING

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.350
ABOUT AS THEY LOOK AT NEW

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:55.651

PRODUCTS. AND SO TO GIVE YOU AN

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.988
EXAMPLE THERE ARE THERE ARE

INHERENT TO CALIFORNIA. THAT

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.792
MAY NOT BE AS A LARGE OF AN

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.995
ISSUE FOR OTHER STATES SO FOR

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.497
EXAMPLE IT DOES ALSO KICK BACK

TO GENERALLY HOW GAMING. IS

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.436
STRUCTURED IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:16.038
EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME OTHER

SO THAT ARE READY PROVIDES A

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:29.218
DIFFERENT FROM WORK BECAUSE WE

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.419
HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT THE

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.955
VOTERS APPROVED. A LEGISLATURE

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:37.726
WAITED ON EXTRA. THE OTHER

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.895
ISSUE. IS A MAJOR NINE

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:40.462
CALIFORNIA AND THE WATER CAN

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:41.130
SPEAK MORE TO IT. IS THAT THERE

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.244
QUICK TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.811
MORE DEPTH BUT THOSE ARE ALL

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:58.013
THINGS THAT WOULD IMPACTS.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.186
COMPARATORS TO OTHER STATES.

WITH MR OBERNOLTE IS. ON

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:58.407
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THOUGH.

01:12:58.474 --> 01:12:59.041
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.043
STRONG ARGUMENT THAT. THE

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.045
APPROACH TAKEN HASHING BILL AND

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:03.579
THE REDUCTION OF MISSION

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:06.181
EXPENSES AND THE SUBSEQUENT

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:09.451
INCREASE IN PRICES WOULD WORK

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:12.921
AGAIN IF WE WENT FROM YOU KNOW.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:16.925
TWELVE TO TEN. ANOTHER SOME

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:19.261
POINT. WHERE YOUR PRIOR WILLING

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.763
TOO MUCH ON THE BALL. WHAT'S

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:23.565
YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:26.468
YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. THE

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:27.336
BREAKDOWN AS I EXPLAINED

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.370
EARLIER I JUST WANT TO RUN

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:28.904
THROUGH IT AGAIN JUST TO

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:29.838
PROVIDE A FRIENDLY REFRESH.

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:30.472
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER OF

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:33.375
13% 7% IS FOR RETAILER

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.611
COMPENSATION AGO STORE TWENTY

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:36.445
THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.547
THE STATE. ABOUT 2% FOR GAMING

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.916
COSTS THOSE ARE. TO ACTUALLY

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.251
PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE THE

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:45.187
SCRATCHERS TICKETS. AND ALSO

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.756
THE CONCEPT WE PROVIDE THAT ARE

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.258
FROM OUR GAMING SYSTEM PROVIDER

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:52.227
IGT. MEETING REMAINING 4% FOR

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:55.130
OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. AND

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:56.899
TYPICALLY WE SPEND AROUND 3% OF

01:13:56.965 --> 01:14:00.102
THAT 4% OR ABOUT THROUGH 75%

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.404
THAT WE SPEND WE TRY TO HOLD

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.605
BACK AS MUCH AS WE CAN WE SENT

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.641
THE DIFFERENCE TO SCHOOLS. SO

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.810
I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY IN THIS

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.478
FORM YOU KNOW WHERE CAN WE CUT

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:10.946
FURTHER I THINK THAT'S

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.881
CERTAINLY DECISION THAT YOU

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:13.615
KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND THE

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.083
LOTTERY COMMISSION WOULD HAVE

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.985
TO FIGURE OUT. BUT I WOULD SAY

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:18.520
BASED ON MY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:19.988
TWO MONTHS EXPERIENCE STUDYING

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.156
THIS INFORMATION AND TALKING TO

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.925
THE STAFF THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.927
EVERY EFFORT TO BE EFFICIENT.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.228
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:29.064
IS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK FIND WAYS

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:29.965
WE CAN INSTITUTE POLICY

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:32.634
PROCEDURES ARE EVEN BETTER AT

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.268
THAT. WHAT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:37.306
WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS. FOR THAT

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.876
A 1% REDUCTION. IN OVERALL THE

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:41.510
MEASURE OF COSTS WOULD ACTUALLY

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:44.346
BE A 25% REDUCTION. IN THAT

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.848
CONTROLLABLE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.015
COSTS SO I MEAN THAT'S

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.584
CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO WAY FROM

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.920
OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU TOUCHED ON

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.356
THE COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:55.591
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP OUR COLLEGE

01:14:55.657 --> 01:15:00.395

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:02.264

MAKING PROCESS ON THE

01:15:03.765 --> 01:15:05.200
EXPENDITURES RIGHT HOW DO WE

THE COUNTRY IT DOES. BEG THE

01:17:54.036 --> 01:18:00.175
QUESTION. DEAR WHY AND IT

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:00.776
SHOULD THAT CONTINUE TO BE THE

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.381
QUESTION AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:07.282
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.650
GERMAN THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.118
LOOK INTO FURTHER AND FIND IF

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.453
THERE'S ANY IN IN FOR

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.088
INFORMATION REVEALED IN A

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:16.024
SURVEY OF STATES AS TWO. TRENDS

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:19.895
OR REASONS FOR THAT BUT I DON'T

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:20.529
KNOW WHY THE RICH OWNERSHIP WAS

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.364
WRITTEN IN THAT MATTER. I THINK

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.099
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DRILL

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.367
DOWN A LITTLE BIT OFF FOLLOW UP

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.836
WITH YOUR OFFICE YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:28.804
GOT WHAT FOUR POINT FOUR

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.073
BILLION OR SOMETHIN PRIZES THIS

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:35.844
PAST YEARS ARE ABOUT RIGHT. AND.

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:36.445
FOUR FOUR SEVEN SIX THAT COULD

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:37.446
JUST OFF TOP MY HEAD GENERATE

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.181
ANYWHERE FROM FOUR HUNDRED

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.982
MILLION TO ONE POINT FIVE

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:44.486
BILLION IN STATE TAX REVENUE.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.021
SO THAT'S SIGNIFICANT INSIDE

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:48.190
LIKE TO CUT A STEP FURTHER WITH

01:18:48.256 --> 01:18:49.658
YOU AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:54.729
GAMES YOU CAN OFFER NO YOU.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:55.263
MADE SOME REFERENCE REALLY

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:55.831
SALLY MADE SOME REFERENCE TO

01:18:55.897 --> 01:19:00.135
WHAT. THE UNIQUENESS OF

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.837
CALIFORNIA. GAMING LAW WHAT THE

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.905
LOTTERY IS ALLOWED OR NOT

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:04.539
ALLOWED TO DO WHAT'S DONE OTHER

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:09.578
STATES. WHAT GAMES CAN YOU

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:12.380
OFFER WHAT GAMES CAN'T SHUT OFF.

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:13.315
THE TWO GAMES UNDER THAT WE

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:15.450
OFFER AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:17.119
OUR PARA MUTUAL GAMES THE LOTTO

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:20.622
GAMES AND SCRATCHERS THOSE THE

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.924
TWO GAMES AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.392
I'D I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:26.661
SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS ON OTHER

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:27.696
TYPES OF GAMES AND THAT'S

01:19:27.762 --> 01:19:28.230
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.364
RESEARCH FURTHER. AND ON THAT

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.100
NOTE IF IN FACT THE VOTERS IN

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.535
THIS STATE SOFFIT TO LEGALIZE

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:37.038
SPORTS WAGERING DO YOU THINK

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:37.539
THE STATE LOTTERY COULD

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:43.945
ADMINISTER SPORTS WAGERING. SO

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.313
THE QUESTION IS COULD THE

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:45.847
LOTTERY ADMINISTER SPORTS

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:46.748
GAMING IS THAT CORRECT SIR.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:51.353
THAT'S THE QUESTION. WELL AGAIN

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:52.754
IN MY LESS THAN TWO MONTHS ON

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.022
THE JOB I HAVE TO START WITH I

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:56.691
DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:57.259
SOMETHING THAT WERE CURIOUS

01:19:57.325 --> 01:20:00.028
ABOUT WHAT ARE THE

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.396
POSSIBILITIES THERE I THINK

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.465
THAT WE CAN GENERALLY HAVE A

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:06.568
MANDATE TO INCREASE SALES IN A

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.036
RESPONSIBLE WAY FOR THE PLAYERS

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.905
OF THE STATE LOTTERY. AND TO

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.339
THE EXTENT THAT SPORTS PRESENTS

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.541
AN OPPORTUNITY WE'D WANT TO

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:15.343
INVESTIGATE THAT AND SEE IF

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.179
THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT IN A

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.548
RESPONSIBLE WAY BUT I COULDN'T

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.382
TODAY IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:23.351
WE MINISTER WE HAVE IN ORDER

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:23.952
FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.154
SEVEN CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.589
ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE FOLKS ARE

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:28.089
HEADQUARTERED HERE IN

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:31.326
SACRAMENTO. WE HAVE ABOUT NINE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:32.861
OR TEN DISTRICT OFFICES AROUND

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:33.995
THE STATE AND A COUPLE

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.630
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHERE

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:36.798
OPERATE IN A IN A PRETTY LEAN

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:40.035
MANNER ALREADY AND I THINK THAT

01:20:40.101 --> 01:20:41.469
YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:42.204
GUIDANCE WE HAVE FROM OUR

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:44.172
LEADERSHIP THAT'S SOMETHING

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:47.542
THAT WE COULD LOOK AT BUT RIGHT

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:48.176
NOW I'M- I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:52.547
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT.

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.048
THANK YOU THAT'S ALL THE

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:58.453
QUESTIONS AND- MISS QUIRK SILVA.

YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.021
YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION UP I

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.856
COME OUT OF EDUCATION SO IN

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:02.591
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I WAS JUST

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.025
STARTING MY TEACHING CAREER AND

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:09.331
I REMEMBER QUITE A BIT OF.

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:10.899
INFORMATION OUT THERE NOT ONLY

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:12.534
TO THE PUBLIC BUT TO EDUCATION

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:14.869
PROFESSIONALS ABOUT HOW THE

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.572
LOTTERY WAS GOING TO. REALLY

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.174
MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR SCHOOLS

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:21.376
AND REALLY A HUGE CAMPAIGN AND

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:24.379
IT WAS VOTED IN. MY CONCERN IS

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.581
THAT YEARS LATER MANY MANY

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:29.884
YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE A

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:32.420
WHOLE NEW GENERATION THAT MAY

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.389
BE BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS

01:21:34.456 --> 01:21:35.857
PARTICIPATING BUT HAVE NO IDEA

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.994
OF THE- ORIGINALS OF THE US.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.229
AND EVEN NOW NOW IS MY CALL THE

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:44.332
WAS SAYING I OFTEN DO GET

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:44.833
PEOPLE SAY HEY WHATEVER

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:47.068
HAPPENED OF THAT LOTTERY MONEY.

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.069
AND IT ISN'T THE IDEA THAT IT'S

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:49.504
NOT GOING WHERE IT WAS STATED

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:51.773
TO GO IT'S THAT THE SCHOOLS IN

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.376
FACT I THINK CAB BECOME VERY

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:57.145
COMPLACENT IN THE SENSE OF WELL

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:57.746
THAT'S JUST THIS MONEY WE GET

01:21:57.812 --> 01:22:01.249
AND- BUT IN THE EARLY DAYS IT

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:03.752
WAS VERY MUCH SPECIFIED. BY THE

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:06.855
BOARDS TO NOT ONLY THE PARENTS

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.357
BUT ALSO TO THE EDUCATORS OF IT

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.393
WHAT EXACTLY THIS MONEY WAS

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:13.194
BEING USED FOR I KNOW THAT YOU

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.829
CAN GO ON TO A SCHOOL

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:17.565
DISTRICT'S WEBSITE AND SEE OR

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.067
THE REQUIRED I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.803
LOOKED. BUT THAT YOU CAN SEE

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.139
HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED SO I

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:26.207
GUESS TWO OR THREE THINGS ONE

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.243
IS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LIKE

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.478
YOU SAY TELL A NEW STORY TO.

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:35.016
YOU KNOW GIVE EXAMPLES. READY

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.384
TO RESTART THAT NARRATIVE OF

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:37.886
WHY WE ORIGINATED THAT. BUT

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:42.223
THEN SECONDLY. IS THERE I THINK

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.826
SOMEBODY JUST ASK DOES IT GO TO

01:22:44.893 --> 01:22:46.561
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.196
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ALLOCATES A

01:22:48.263 --> 01:22:50.398
DRUG SO WE COULD HAVE SCHOOLS

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:52.901
RECEIVING SOME AND OTHERS NOT

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:55.136
RECEIVING ANY. I THINK THAT

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.038
THAT THAT WOULD IS A BIG

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:58.340
SURPRISE FOR ME SITTING HERE

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:01.209
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IN FACT EVERY

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:04.579
SCHOOL GOT SOMETHING SO I THINK

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.415
THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:12.354
CONVERSATION BECAUSE. YOU KNOW

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:12.921
NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:14.556
SOME MAY NEED MORE OF X. THAN

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:16.725
OTHERS BUT- THAT THAT'S

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.494
IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MANY

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:22.364
PEOPLE AT THAT TIME IN NINETEEN

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.931
EIGHTY FOUR VOTED FOR THIS

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:26.668
UNDER THE- SUPPORT OF EDUCATION

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.103
ANDTHIRTY YEARS LATER ALMOST

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.572
OR TWENTY FIVE. I THINK THAT

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:33.141
THE RE STATING THAT AND REALLY

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.976
BRINGING THE SCHOOLS BACK INTO

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.945
THE DISCUSSION AND STARTED TO

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:39.581
LOOK FOR WAYS THAT THE PUBLIC

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.949
CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.617
DOLLARS ARE BEING IS BECAUSE I

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.386
DO SO I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:48.156
TEACHER SALARIES OF THEIR- SO.

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:49.824
I THINK THERE'S SOME WORK WE

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:50.425
COULD DO NOW TO UPDATE WHAT'S

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:53.895
HAPPENING. WE STRONGLY AGREE WE

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:54.562
THINK THAT WE NEED TO RENEW AN

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:55.864
UPDATE THE STORY ABOUT THE

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.298
LOTTERY WHAT THE LOTTERY DOES

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.767
AND THE MONEY THAT GOES TO OUR

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.702
LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IN A SENSE

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:02.003
YOU KNOW IT IT'S A STORY OF

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.171
LOCAL CONTROL WE KNOW THAT

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:04.305
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.474
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION MAKE

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.342
THOSE SPENDING THIS MAKE THOSE

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:10.311
SPENDING DECISIONS. AND YOU

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:12.013

AWARE OF RIGHT AFTER THE

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:18.386
LOTTERY WAS WAS CREATED. SO

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:19.754
FROM WHERE WE SAID WE WANT TO

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:21.189
BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORIES

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:22.657
THAT WE CAN LEARN ABOUT AND

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.391
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT ABOUT HOW

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.827
LOTTERY MONIES USED. TO SUPPORT

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.496

THE QUESTION OF. SHOULD WE PUT

REGARDING LOTTERY PRACTICES. A

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:23.711
LOT OF THE LOTTERIES BUSINESSES

THAT THEY'RE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN

THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:41.329
OVERSIGHT. WE THINK THAT THE

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:41.896
CONTROLS COULD BE BETTER AND

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:44.499
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. GOT IT

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:47.235
SEE. I KNOW THERE'S A CHECK IN

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:52.440
WITH THE AUDIT. RIGHT FOR EACH

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:53.741
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:54.642
IMPLEMENTED SO ARE THOSE THINGS

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.544
THAT WE CAN SEE IN YOUR AGENDA

01:26:56.611 --> 01:27:00.615
ITEMS. AT THE COMMISSION

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:03.184
MEETINGS OR WE GET THAT I KNOW

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.019
YOU SAID THE CONTROLLER AUDITS

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.287
AND THE CONTROLLERS THERE BUT I

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.156
MEAN HONESTLY THE CONTROLLER

01:27:08.222 --> 01:27:08.790
WAS THERE BEFORE AND THEN WE

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:09.757
HAD ALL THESE BAD HEADLINES

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.659
AND- WE HAVE THE INCIDENTS AS

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:12.994
WE HAVE I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:15.029
FIGURE OUT. ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.397
YOU KNOW ONE ARE YOU COMMITTED

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:17.765
TO ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:18.967
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THEM AND

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:20.835
NOT JUST DISCUSSING THEM BUT

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.070
SEEING AN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:23.838
PLAN IN PLACE CAN THE

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.840
LEGISLATURE EXPECT TO SEE THAT

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:29.911
BY THE END OF THE YEAR. OR.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:30.578
THERE SUIT YOU KNOW. SOON

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.714
THEREAFTER. AND THEN I THINK

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.115
THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO SOME OF

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.950
THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WERE

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:38.019
ASKED AS WELL FOR WHAT WE DO

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.888
POLICY WISE PROBABLY NEXT YEAR.

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:42.957
WELL I CAN START THE RESPONSE

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:43.992
TO QUESTION BY EXPLAINING THAT

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:46.194
WE DO HAVE. AN ENGAGEMENT WITH

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:47.228
EACH OF THE AUDITOR'S THAT

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.696
COMES THROUGH ALL THAT

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:49.797
INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.834
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND WE DO GO

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.901
THROUGH THE FINDINGS WE DISCUSS

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:56.537
THE FINDINGS WITH THEM. AND WE

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:58.306
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:58.973
ADDRESS THEIR FINDINGS IN THERE

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.375
SOME BACK AND FORTH THEY

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.744
EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS OUR

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.845
SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING YOUR

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:06.748
FINDINGS AND- WE YOU KNOW WE GO

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:07.682
THROUGH THIS WITH EACH OF THE

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.350
ENTITIES THAT REVIEWS. ARE

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.853
ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS AND

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:15.456
SOLVE THAT IS SUBJECT TO PUBLIC

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:16.090
DISCO DISCLOSURE. THESE ARE THE

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:20.762
KIND OF WANT TO. SO THE IN THE

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.262
AUDIT REPORT THAT THE

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:22.697
CONTROLLERS LEAST IN APRIL THEY

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:24.032
COMMITTED TO RETURNING IN

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:25.667
OCTOBER TWO. YOU SEE THAT WERE

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:26.300
FOLLOWING UP ON THE ITEMS THAT

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:27.435
WE SAID WE WOULD. SO WE WOULD

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.404
EXPECT THE CONTROLLER TO

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:31.639
RELEASE ANOTHER DOCUMENT

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:34.776
OUTLINING OUR SUCCESSES IN IN

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:39.881
IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES. ALL

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:40.481
RIGHT AND THEN I JUST WANT TO

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:41.015
ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:41.549
BECAUSE I THINK. SOMEBODY

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:42.083
BROUGHT IT UP EARLIER THE

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.551
REASON WHY MORE MONEY IS

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.753
CONTACT EDUCATION IS. WOULD YOU

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.455
SAY IT'S BECAUSE WE REMOVE THE

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.290
PERCENTAGE REQUIRED TO GO TO

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:52.694
EDUCATION. WITH THE HI ASHLEY

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.327
BILL I THINK IT WAS IT SOMEBODY

01:28:53.394 --> 01:28:55.430
MENTIONED EARLIER. I MEAN IS

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.064
THAT THE DIRECT CORRELATION ARE

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:58.666
WE JUST SAY MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:28:58.733 --> 01:28:59.967
ACTUALLY JUST PARTICIPATING IN

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.903
GAMES. THE REASON GAMES I'M

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:05.073
SORRY I GOT. SURE THE REASON

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.674
WHY WE KNOW THAT MORE MONEY IS

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.809
BEING DRIVEN EDUCATION NOW

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:09.444
VERSUS TEN YEARS AGO IS BECAUSE

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.546
THE HIGH ASHI BILL REMOVE THE

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:15.416
CAP ON PRICES. PREVIOUSLY IN

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:16.017
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN THE

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:17.351
LOTTERY ACT WAS PASSED BY THE

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.954
VOTERS 50% OF THE VOTERS. THERE

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:20.955
IS A CAP OF 50% OF WHAT COULD

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:23.925
BE SPENT ON PRICES BY PROVIDING

01:29:23.991 --> 01:29:25.727
MORE FLEXIBILITY ON THE PRICES

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:27.528
THAT ALLOWS A LOTTERY TO OFFER

01:29:27.595 --> 01:29:28.796
MORE ATTRACTIVE PRODUCTS. AND

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:32.233
THAT DRIVE SALES. SO MORE SALES

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.402
MEANS MORE REVENUES MORE

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.336
REVENUES MEANS MORE MONEY TO

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.638
EDUCATION. GOT IT BUT THE I

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.273
THINK MISTRAL NOT TO BROUGHT

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.309
THIS POINT UP EVEN THOUGH THE

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:41.943
REVENUES GONE UP THE PERCENTAGE

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:45.313
HAS GONE DOWN. RIGHT SO IF WE

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:45.780
WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.249
PERCENTAGE BACK IN. YOU KNOW IT

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:49.650
IS STRAIGHT OF REALLY SOMEBODY

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:51.152
WOULD ARGUE YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:54.589
THAT MONEY'S BEEN MISUSED. I

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:55.623
MEAN WHAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.859
TO THAT WELL SITUATES WOULD ASK

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:58.760
I WOULD SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.027
STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.295
FOUND THAT IN THE IN THE I

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:02.663
THINK ONE OF THE REPORTS SAY

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:05.566
YOUR ALLUDING TO. A FINDING OF

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:06.901
ABOUT THRE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.471
DOLLARS WHICH IS IMPORTANT WE

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:11.072
TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY WE'RE

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.975
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. WE

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:14.509
WOULD SEE THOUGH WE WOULD

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:15.443
COMPARE THAT TO THE FACT THAT

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.778
WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS

01:30:16.844 --> 01:30:19.714
WITH. SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAT

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.349
HAVE BEEN INDICATED MEASURE THE

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:22.183
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:23.618
DOLLARS AND WE ARE ADDRESSING

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:24.952
THOSE PROBLEMS.

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:25.953
ADMINISTRATIVELY SO THAT THE

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.789
HOPEFULLY WILL NOT BE REPEATED.

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:28.790
WE THINK THAT THE OVERALL

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.658
STRUCTURAL CHANGES THE PRICE

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:31.926
FLEXIBILITY GRANTED. BY THE

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:33.561
LEGISLATURE TEN YEARS AGO. HAS

01:30:33.628 --> 01:30:35.429
RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF

01:30:35.496 --> 01:30:35.897
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:38.332
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS.

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:39.967
WE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AS WE

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.270
WERE TALKING EARLIER WITH THE

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.672
COMMITTEES HERE THAT. BY

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.474
IDENTIFYING EFFICIENCIES WITHIN

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:47.308
OUR OPERATIONS WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:30:47.375 --> 01:30:48.676
BEEN ABLE TO FUNCTION

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:51.879
UNDERNEATH THE EFFECTIVE CAP OF

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.414
THIRTEEN PERCENT. AND WE SENT

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:53.915
THAT DIFFERENCE BACK TO

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:54.916

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.605
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE. FIVE

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:18.573

DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT SO

THE STATE COMPTROLLER PERFORMS

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:33.321
A LOT OF OUR FINANCIALS EVERY

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.456
QUARTER AND IT THEY THEY

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.324

SOLELY ON THE AVERAGE DAILY

ATTENDANCE FORMULAS. SO IT'S

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:42.964

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:55.543
VERSUS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:58.446
ONE MILLION TWO CAN COLLEGES.

01:31:58.512 --> 01:31:59.747
SO IS K. TWELVE HAS THE

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:00.815
MAJORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:02.316
STUDENT ALSO JUST BE IT JUST

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:03.718
BASED ON. SO BODIES ROOF

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:19.967
CORRECT OKAY

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:23.838
. BUT IT DOESN'T.

01:32:23.905 --> 01:32:30.745
UC'S IS. IT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:31.979
CORRECT TO MAKE SEE THEY WANT

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:32.580
TO GO BACK AND CHECK IT TO ME

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:33.781
JUST FOR EXAMPLE JUST I DON'T

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:35.950
HAVE THE STUDENTS IN FRONT OF

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:38.686
ME BUT JUST YOU SEE CSU I MEAN.

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:41.589
I THOUGHT CSU HAD MORE THAN.

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:42.189
50% MORE STUDENTS AND YOU SEE

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:46.627
BUT I COULD BE WRONG. BUT YEAH

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:50.064
YES RIGHT YES WHY SEASON WITH

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:55.569
50% MORE. WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO

01:32:55.636 --> 01:32:56.404
THAT MISTER SHERMAN AND REPORT

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:59.507
BACK BUT AS HAS BEEN INDICATED

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:00.541
THE FORMULA IS DETERMINED BY

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:02.777
THE SIMPLY AVERAGE DAILY

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:05.212
ATTENDANCE IN THE SEGMENTS SO

01:33:05.279 --> 01:33:08.015
THE LOTTERY DOESN'T CONTROL

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:08.582
WHERE THE MONEY GOES OR HOW

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:09.083
MUCH EITHER. EACH OF THE

01:33:09.150 --> 01:33:12.286
SEGMENTS GETS. THE AVERAGE

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:14.555
DAILY ATTENDANCE IS SAID IN BY

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:15.122
THE PROPOSITION OR IS THAT A

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:21.495
STATURE. IN THE PROPOSITIONS.

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:28.069
THEN. GOING TO BACK TO YOUR

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:30.004
EXPENDITURES AND JUST TO

01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:31.605
REVENUE SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE A

01:33:31.672 --> 01:33:34.108
REVENUE CHART I SURE MISTER

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:36.510
OBERNOLTE SKEPTICISM NIGHT

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:37.378
EITHER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.312
DON'T SIT ON GEO SO MAYBE HE

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.847
DOES BETTER I STILL SURE THE

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:41.916
SKEPTICISM IN TERMS OF THE

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:42.783
INCREASE OF REVENUE BEING

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.218
DRIVEN BY THE PRICES DO YOU

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:48.322
HAVE ANY. DATA OR STUDIES THAT

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:51.926
SORT OF CORROBORATE THAT. THE

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:52.526
CRIME RATE THE RELATIONSHIP

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:57.365
BETWEEN PRICES AND REVENUE YES.

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.532
WOMEN'S STUDIES ON THE ICE AS

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:00.634
HE NODDED YES SO THE PART OF

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:01.969
THE WHAT INFLUENCED THE HI

01:34:02.036 --> 01:34:02.636
ACTUALLY BILL IN THE FIRST

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:03.871
PLACE WAS WITH THE LOTTERY AT

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:04.672
THAT TIME CONSULTED WITH AN

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:09.010
OUTSIDE ENTITY TO LOOK AT THAT.

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:11.812
RELATIONSHIP AS WAS NOTED.

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:14.548
CALIFORNIA OF WAS. BEHIND SOME

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:15.383
OF THE OTHER NATIONAL LOTTERIES

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:16.884
THAT ALREADY HAVE THE PRICE

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:17.351
LOOKS ABILITY SO THIS

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:19.453
INDEPENDENT FIRM. CONFIRMS THE

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.555
CORRELATION OBVIOUSLY THERE

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.857
IT'S A BALANCE THERE COMES A

01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:25.459
POINT WHERE. I LIKE TO GIVE THE

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:27.228
EXTREME EXAMPLE WE GET OFF A

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:29.096
GAME THAT OFFERS A 100% PRIZE

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.598
PAYOUT. PEOPLE LINED UP TO PLAY

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:31.799
THAT GAME BECAUSE EVERY TICKET

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:33.801
WINS. WE'D OBVIOUSLY LOSE MONEY

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.136
WE WOULDN'T GENERATE FUNDING TO

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:36.771
EDUCATION SO WE WOULD NEVER DO

01:34:36.837 --> 01:34:37.538
SUCH A THING. BUT THAT

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:38.539
ILLUSTRATES THE THERE'S A

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.274
BALANCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.576
YOU. OFFERED TO LET THE PLAYERS

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:44.345
TO INCENTIVIZE THE SALES AND

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:46.080
WHAT WE'RE GIVING TO EDUCATION.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:47.314
THE TOTAL AGREE I'M NOT ONE

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:48.516
WHICH IS WHAT I LOOK AT YOUR

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:49.216
YOUR HAND OUT THIS IS THE

01:34:49.283 --> 01:34:50.718
HANNAH YOU YOU HAD A RIGHT YES

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.686
SIR IF I IF I JUST LOOK AT THE-

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:56.157
BLUE LINE OF REVENUE. YOU COULD

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:57.091
YOU COULD COME TO YOUR

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.659
CONCLUSION WHICH SAYS THAT YOU

01:34:58.726 --> 01:34:59.293
KNOW WE OFFER MORE PRICES SO

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.430
WHEN I. DID TO ME THIS LOOKS

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.664
LIKE AN ECONOMIC CYCLE. THIS

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:08.803
LOOKS LIKE. AMIR IS THE EXACT.

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:14.875
THE NEAREST ECONOMY. WHAT THE

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.011
NEAR STATE REVENUE SO. SO TO ME

01:35:17.078 --> 01:35:17.611
THE QUESTION IS IF YOU IF WE

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:18.145
DID NOTHING WOULD WE HAVE

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:18.746
GOTTEN. A SIMILAR INDICATION

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:19.914
JUST BECAUSE- OF ECONOMIC

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.183
INDICATORS AND- THIS IS. THIS

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:23.317
IS WHAT NATURALLY WOULD HAVE

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.785
JUST OCCURRED REGARDLESS OF.

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:26.387
THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE

01:35:26.454 --> 01:35:30.858
TWENTY TO EDUCATION. AND I

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:32.026
WOULD SAY THAT SO IF YOU IF

01:35:32.093 --> 01:35:33.727
EXTENDED THE CHART BEYOND THE

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:35.162
YEARS WERE SHOWING THE SIR

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:36.597
DURING THE .COM BOOM FOR

01:35:36.664 --> 01:35:39.033
EXAMPLE THE SALES AND COUNTRIES

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:39.934
IN EDUCATION WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:40.768
IN LINE WITH THE ECONOMY AT

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:41.936
THAT TIME SO. THERE'S NO

01:35:42.002 --> 01:35:44.538
QUESTION THAT THE LOTTERY WAS

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.273
KIND OF FINDING OUT IN TERMS OF

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.041
WHAT ITS CONFUSION EDUCATION

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:50.511
WERE. SO IF WE STAY ON THE PATH

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:53.848
WE WERE ON WE'VE- THE- LOGIC IS

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.449
THAT WOULD BE AT THE CLUB.

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:56.750
COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE AT

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.085
THAT TIME WHAT WAS THAT. DID DO

01:35:58.152 --> 01:36:01.122
YOU HAVE TO KEEP INTEREST IN

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:04.825
AMONG THE PLAYERS AND WITH THE

01:36:04.892 --> 01:36:05.426
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE WERE UNDER

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.295
WITH THE PAST TENSE THERE WERE

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.164
NOT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:12.967
US TO OFFER MORE TYPES OF GAMES

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:14.735
THAT PLAYERS WOULD. I AM

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:16.871
INTERESTING SYSTEM PRE AB

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:21.142
NINETY. ONE ONE FOR YOU LOOKS

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.443
LIKE A SPEAK FIVE OH SIX AND

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.512
WENT DOWN. IS THAT BECAUSE THEY

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:31.886
LOST INTEREST. OR THAT BECAUSE

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:32.486
THE ECONOMY STARTED GOING DOWN

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:41.462
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY. PRIZE

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:42.596
PAYOUT COMPARED TO SOME OF THE

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:45.466
OTHER GAMES. SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.401
FOR SURE EXPLAINS THE SPIKE IN

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:49.737
CONTRITION AD FOR THAT YEAR.

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.305
AND WHICH THEN MAKES THE OTHER

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:52.706
STUFF RIGHT YEARS LOOK LIKE IN

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:55.075
A DECLINE. ENERGY YOU CAN SEE

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:58.445
SIMILAR SPIKES IN TWO THOUSAND

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:00.047
LEVIN TWELVE THAT WAS. MEGA

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:03.083
MILLIONS JACKPOT GOT UP TO SIX

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:03.717
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:06.720
THE RECORD AT THAT TIME.

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:11.058
SIMILARLY AND IN TWO THOUSAND.

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:11.625
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT'S WHEN

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.127
POWER BALL GOT TO ADVERTISE ONE

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:16.463
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:19.066
THAT WAS A RECORD AT THAT TIME.

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.834
YEAH BUT I CRAZY ARE YOU THAT'S

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:24.238
JUSTICE INDICATOR OF THE- TIMES

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.940
IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.942
TO SPEND AT THE CONNECTION

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:28.542
BETWEEN FOOD AND A LOT OF THE

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:30.344
GONNA BUY FOOD RIGHT. SO IN

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:33.047
TERMS OF. SINCEFUNDS IT COULD

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:33.581
JUST BE A FUNCTION OF GOOD

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:34.215
ECONOMIC INDICATORS RATHER THAN

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.717
OF. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

01:37:36.784 --> 01:37:38.385
LOTTERY LET ME ASK ANOTHER

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:40.120
QUESTION WHAT'S THE WHAT'S WHAT

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:40.921
WOULD YOU SAY IF I ASK YOU

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:42.223
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE CORE MISSION

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.457
OF THE LOTTERY. OF OTHER

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:44.058
DEPARTMENTS THE AGENCY CORE

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.626
CORE MISSION THE CORE MISSION

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:46.994
ISTO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:48.195
FUNDING FOR EDUCATION THAT'S

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.396
RIGHT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY.

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.764
THEN THAT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:53.334
SO I GOT A QUESTION SO IN TERMS

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.135
OF PERSONAL COST BASED ON THE

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:57.671
LA CHART. IS IT CORRECT THAT

01:37:57.738 --> 01:38:01.609
PERSONNEL COSTS FROM ALWAYS TO

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:02.243
NINE TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WENT

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:09.116
FROM ABOUT. FORTY NINE MILLION.

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:09.717
TO ONE OH ONE MILLION THIS IS

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:10.284
JUST STRAIGHT ON PAGE TWO OF

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:14.855
THE ATLANTA. THAT WOULD APPEAR

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:15.489
TO BE THE CASE FROM THE NUMBERS

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:16.890
THAT ARE ON THE CHART YES. GOT

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:19.426
SO I GUESS WANT ONE QUESTION

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:20.060
WHY LOOK AT PERSONNEL COSTS AND

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:21.428
THE PERSONAL COST. IN THE BEING

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:24.231
ROUGHLY ABOUT 15% OF OVERALL

01:38:24.298 --> 01:38:26.433
EXPENSES. NOT JUST PERSONAL

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:30.337
COST. I JUST DO I JUST DID

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:31.672
DIVISION YOU COULD YOU COULD

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.474
TAKE A CALCULATOR WHICH IS

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:36.377
WHICH IS WHAT I DID I DIDN'T.

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:36.944
MR OBERNOLTE DOESN'T IN THIS

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:39.980
HAD I USED TO COME. THANK YOU

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:41.682
MISTER CHAIRMAN. I HAVE NOT HAD

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.516
THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THE

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:44.385
NUMBERS MYSELF BUT WHAT YOU SAY

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:45.319
SOUNDS REASONABLE AND PROBABLY

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:46.687
CORRECT SIR. I THINK I CAN I

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:49.123
GUESS IT'S A LITTLE BIT.

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:52.559
CONCERNING SOME WONDERING. YOU

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.728
HAVE THIS ALMOST AS MANY

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:58.699
EMPLOYEES AS THE LEGISLATURE.

01:38:58.766 --> 01:38:59.233
BECAUSE LEGISLATORS ABOUT

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.668
THOUSAND SO SIMPLE USING YOUR

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:01.268
ABOUT A HUNDRED I'M JUST KIND

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:04.772
OF CURIOUS. WHAT ON WHAT WHAT

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:05.806
THE HELL EIGHT HUNDRED

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:06.373
INDIVIDUALS DO INJURE YOUR

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.608
PERSONAL CASA HUNDRED MILLION

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:10.944
IS MORE IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:16.383
GIVE TO UC AND CSU COMBINED. SO

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:16.984
TO ME MY CONCERN REAP WHAT THE

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:17.618
REASONS WERE HAVING THE HEARING

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:21.455

WHY YOU'RE HERE MISTER JOHNSON

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.526
THE SHIP. THE PERCEPTION ISN'T

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:28.329
THAT. THE MISSION OF THE

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:31.265
ORGANIZATION IS. TO FUND

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:36.370
EDUCATION THE MISSION SEEMS

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:36.904
LIKE THEY'RE IN THE GAMING

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:40.474
BUSINESS AND. PART OF THE PRIZE

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:41.475
MONEY GOES TO EDUCATION LIKE

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:45.012
EDUCATION YOU WANT RIGHT. SO I

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:47.681
THINK THE QUESTION IS HERE WE

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:48.816
WERE YOU HEARING A SIGNIFICANT

01:39:48.882 --> 01:39:50.884
AMOUNT OF CONCERN IS WHEN YOU

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:52.586
LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:54.188
YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT.

01:39:54.254 --> 01:39:58.025
COSTS OF THE SEVEN BILLION

01:39:58.092 --> 01:39:58.992
DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:02.463
BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES ONLY

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:04.631
ONE POINT SIX COAST EDUCATION.

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:08.302
WELL I'D LIKE TO START MISTER

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:08.836
CHAIRMAN BY ADDRESSING THE

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:09.436
POINT YOU RAISED EARLIER IN

01:40:09.503 --> 01:40:12.239
YOUR COMMENTS ARE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:13.507
AND FORTY SEVEN EMPLOYEES CIVIL

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:15.676
SERVICE EMPLOYEES WORK HARD TO

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.411
SERVE THE MISSION OF A LOTTERY

01:40:17.478 --> 01:40:20.280
TO SUPPLEMENT EDUCATION FUNDING

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.616
AND THEY SERVICE TWENTY THREE

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.518
THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:27.221
FOUR CORNERS OF THE STATE AND-

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:29.123
A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:32.926
BASED ON ATTRACTING AND WORKING

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:34.995
WITH AND SERVICING. THOSE

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:37.765
TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS.

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.666
WE OPERATE NINE DISTRICT

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:41.235
OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE WITH

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:41.869
TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ONE IN

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:42.770
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:45.606
CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:48.075
THE OVERALL GOALS OF OUR

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.810
LEADERSHIP AS EMBODIED IN THE

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.178
COMMISSION AND THE

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:53.046
ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN PRIOR

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:55.149
ADMINISTRATIONS HAS BEEN WHAT'S

01:40:55.215 --> 01:40:56.417
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO SELL

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:59.019
THIS PRODUCT. MAXIMIZE THOSE

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:00.387
SALES WITH THE HARDWORKING

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:02.322
STAFF THAT WE HAVE I'M PLEASED

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:04.191
TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.426
MET QUITE A FEW OF THE FOLKS

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:06.126
HEADQUARTERED IN SACRAMENTO

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:08.729
AND- MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAN TELL

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:09.363
YOU A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE

01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.598
BEEN THERE FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:12.666
AND THEY TAKE THEIR JOBS VERY

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.903
SERIOUSLY. AND SO YOU KNOW I

01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:17.538
THINK THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.572
TO FIND WAYS TO DO OUR JOB

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:19.706
BETTER THAT'S WHY I'VE ORDERED

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:20.808
A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OUR

01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:22.476
POLICIES PROCEDURES. TO MAKE

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:23.610
SURE THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENTLY

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.312
FOLLOWED SO WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.313
KINDS OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.115
BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. I

01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:29.616
WANT TO FIND EFFICIENCIES SO

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:31.752
THAT WE CAN REDUCE OUR MINISTRY

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:32.719
FOR PRETTY EVEN MORE IF THAT'S

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:36.056
POSSIBLE. BUT I THINK THAT THE

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:38.859
MISSION IS ALWAYS BEEN HOW DO

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:39.460
WE DO IT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:47.167
WAY POSSIBLE. OKAY SO. I DON'T.

01:41:47.234 --> 01:41:47.968
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:50.871
QUESTIONS THAT'S OKAY. SO ONE

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:55.509
ONE IN. FOR EVERY SEVEN DOLLARS

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:56.810
ONE DOLLAR GOES INTO RETAIL

01:41:56.877 --> 01:42:00.481
COST CAME COST PERSONAL COSTS.

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.650
AND MARKETING COSTS. SORRY I

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:07.354
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE.

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:10.691
MODEL OF EFFICIENCY. IN

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:13.360
ADDITION THE AS THE LA NOTED

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.629
REVENUES HAVE GONE UP A HUNDRED

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:20.467
AND 34% BUT. MONEY TO EDUCATION

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:27.741
ONLY WENT UP 60% SO THAT THAT

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.243
TO ME STRIKES ME AS AN

01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:29.843
IMBALANCE BETWEEN YOUR MISSION

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:34.948
AND YOUR. A AND YOUR YOUR YOUR-

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:38.385
YOUR BUSINESS MODEL. WELL THE

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:38.986
BUSINESS MODEL SIR IS BASED ON

01:42:39.052 --> 01:42:42.623
THE FACT THAT. THERE'S AS WE'VE

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:44.124
JUST AS WELL AS WE HAVE

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.726
DISCUSSED AND TALK ABOUT THIS

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:46.426
HEARING THERE'S A TIGHT

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.162
CORRELATION BETWEEN. THE PRICES

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:51.265
THAT THE LOTTERY CAN OFFER THE

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:54.067
EXPENSE TO OFFER THOSE PRICES

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:57.671
AND- THE RELATED OVERHEAD AND

01:42:57.738 --> 01:43:02.109
SO WE KNOW THAT IF WE CHANGE

01:43:02.175 --> 01:43:03.644
THE PRICE STRUCTURE IF WE

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:05.112
REDUCE THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.513
PRICES THERE WOULD BE LESS

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:10.918
SALES. WE THINK THAT THE BEST

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.219
METRIC FOR DETERMINING THE

01:43:12.286 --> 01:43:14.488
LOTTERY SUCCESS IN MEETING ITS

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:15.889
MISSION IS THE AMOUNT OF

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:18.191
DOLLARS DRIVEN EDUCATION OKAY

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:18.825
LET'S GO DON'T AYE AYE AYE FALL

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:23.063
THE METRIC SO. USING THAT SAME

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:26.500
MINDSET FROM EIGHT TOLD NOW.

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.068
THE REVENUES IN TERMS OF MONEY

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.970
TOWARDS EDUCATION IS SIX

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:32.706
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT.

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:33.240
THE INCREASE IS ABOUT THAT

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:36.677
RANGE YES I. BUT THE REVENUES

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:40.380
WENT UP FOR BILLION DOLLARS. SO

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:42.783
ONLY 15% OF YOUR REVENUES WENT

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:54.161
TO YOUR CORE MISSION. WELL THAT

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:56.797
IS SEEM TO GET WE ALL ESTABLISH

01:43:56.863 --> 01:43:57.397
WILL AGREE THERE'S NO ARGUMENT

01:43:57.464 --> 01:43:58.966
WITH WITH THE MISSION. WE'RE

01:43:59.032 --> 01:43:59.566
JUST WONDERING WHY THERE'S NO

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:02.369
MORE MONEY GOING TO EDUCATION.

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.271
SO YOU HAD THREE POINT SIX

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:04.805
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:11.511
ELSEWHERE. IT GOES SURPRISES IT

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:14.281
GOES TO OUR RETAILERS IT GOES

01:44:14.348 --> 01:44:16.683
TO OUR VENDORS THE COST OF IN.

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:17.317
QUESTION WE'RE WENT IT'S RIGHT

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.518
HERE IN FRONT OF US THIS IS ALL

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:19.753
CONTROL WE'RE WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:20.721
NOT WE'RE NOT THE AUDITOR'S

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:21.755
WE'RE NOT ARGUING OVER WHERE

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:23.690
THE MONEY'S GOING YES OR

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:27.294
WHETHER IT WAS MISAPPROPRIATED

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:27.861
WAIT WAIT WHAT WE'RE ASKING

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.663
THIS IN TERMS OF THE MISSION.

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:30.497
RIGHT THE OVERALL MISSION OF

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:33.100
THE ORGANIZATION IS MORE MONEY

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:34.868
FOR SCHOOLS SIDE A TIME WHEN

01:44:34.935 --> 01:44:36.703
REVENUES WENT UP A HUNDRED AND

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:39.239
34% HOW IS IT THAT ONLY.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:40.674
FINDING YOUR MAIN CORE MISSION

01:44:40.741 --> 01:44:44.845
ONLY WENT UP 60% AND HOW WAS IT

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:48.348
THAT WHILE YOU INCREASED. FOUR

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:49.816
BILLION DOLLARS ONLY SIX

01:44:49.883 --> 01:44:50.851
HUNDRED MILLION OF THE WINTER

01:44:50.917 --> 01:44:51.451
EDUCATION WHICH IS ONLY A 15%

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:53.253
ALLOCATION. EVEN A LOWER

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:58.158
PERCENTAGE RIGHT ME. IT'S A

01:44:58.225 --> 01:44:58.725
IT'S A LOWER PERCENTAGE THE

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:02.929
WHERE YOU START. SO TO ME THAT

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.831
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:05.465
SEEMS LIKE YOU YOUR MISSION HAS

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:08.568
BEEN ERODED. WELL I KNOW I KNOW

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:11.271
FROM MY OWN REVIEW THE FIGURE

01:45:11.338 --> 01:45:15.108
SIR THAT. ESSENTIALLY A LOT OF

01:45:15.175 --> 01:45:18.745
THE DIFFERENCES IN MORE PRICES.

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:19.379
IN TERMS OF WHERE THE MONEY HAS

01:45:19.446 --> 01:45:22.916
BEEN SHIFTED. AND WHEN WE'RE

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:24.785
ABLE TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:25.385
PRIZES THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THE

01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:29.956
SALES. OKAY SURPRISES WHEN UP

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:31.191
THREE BILLION DURING THE SAME

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:36.663
TIME. SIX HUNDRED WENT TO

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.198
EDUCATION SO FOUR HUNDRED. INTO

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:43.003
EVERYTHING ELSE. I'M SORRY SIR

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:46.907
I WAS IT WAS CONFIRMD AFTER

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:47.441
WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION SIR

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:50.010
NOTED NO I I'M JUST I'M JUST A.

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:53.246
MAKING STATE SO AGAIN YOU. YOUR

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:54.381
SAYS SO YOU'RE SAYING WHERE THE

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:54.915
MONEY WENT RIGHT SO THREE

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:56.149
BILLION WENT TO PRICES. SIX

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:57.918
HUNDRED MILLION WENT EDUCATION

01:45:57.984 --> 01:45:58.485
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WENT TO

01:45:58.552 --> 01:46:01.588
EXPENSES. OTHER EXPENSES ALL

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.990
THE DIFFERENT EXPENSES HERE. SO

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:07.894
I THINK THE QUESTION IS. COULD

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:09.763
THERE BE OTHER LESS PRIZE MONEY

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:12.332
OR LESS EXPENSES AND MORE MONEY

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:17.604
GOING TO EDUCATION. WELL WE

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.905
THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A BIT

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:20.073
BECAUSE THE WHOLE REASON YOU'RE

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.208
A STATE EMPLOYEE DURING

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:23.977
EXISTENCE IS TO FUND EDUCATION.

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:25.946
BUT IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE THE WITH

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:26.546
THE ONE THING THAT'S HAPPENED

01:46:26.613 --> 01:46:29.950
IS. YOU'RE THE SCHOOLS ARE

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:31.451
GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.085
THAT REALLY WHAT YOU'VE MANAGES

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:35.422
TO REALLY INCREASE. THIS

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:36.990
LOTTERY ENTERPRISE. I MEAN

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:39.259
THAT. THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:41.128
EXPENSES LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT

01:46:41.194 --> 01:46:41.928
THAT HAVE GROWN FROM ALMOST

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:44.831
FOUR HUNDRED. MILLION HAS MORE

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:45.432
THAN DOUBLED TO EIGHT HUNDRED

01:46:45.499 --> 01:46:48.168
AND THIRTY THREE MILLION. SO

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:48.802
THAT'S DOUBLE BUT THE EDUCATION

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:53.273
FUNDING HAS DOUBLED. SO THAT

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:54.708
SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY SUCCESS HAS

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:57.244
BEEN THAT THE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:59.946
GROWN WHAT THE TIME THE

01:47:00.013 --> 01:47:00.480
PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY TO

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:01.715
EDUCATION HAS GROWN. IN A

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:08.889
SIMILAR MANNER. WELL. I KNOW

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:10.857
THAT IF WE REDUCE THE MONEY FOR

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:11.458
PRICES WOULD REDUCE SALES AND

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:14.761
ALL THE MONEY. WOULD BE

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:17.297
DIMINISH THE PIE WOULD BE SMALL.

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:19.132
I KNOW THAT IF WE CHANGE WHAT

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:20.367
WE PAY THE TWENTY THREE

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:22.002
THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:22.602
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD

01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:23.236
IMPACT OUR ABILITY FOR SALES AS

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:29.709
WELL. I KNOW THAT. A LOT OF THE

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.912

WE CAN DO OUR JOBS BETTER. WITH

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:12.652
LESS THAN TWO MONTHS ON THE JOB

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:13.887
I CAN'T GIVE YOU A FIRM

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.689
SOLUTION FOR. US ON THE

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.157
QUESTIONS YOU ASK SUCH AS THE

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:18.992
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT THE

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:20.026
NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.895
PLAIN ME INDICATE THAT THERE

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:24.231
HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:24.865
IN THAT REGARD. AND I KNOW THAT

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:30.470
WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. BUT

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:32.272
AGAIN HAVE AND JUST JUST TAKING

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:36.209
A- LOOK IT SEEMS LIKE. AGAIN I

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:37.277
THINK THE LOTTERY HAS SORT OF

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:39.613
LOSSES WHERE. YOU HAVE AN

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.781
ORGANIZATION. THAT HAS GROWN

01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:44.851
ITS OPERATION. THAT REALLY

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:45.385
ALMOST AT THE EXPENSE OF

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:47.988
EDUCATION NOT FOR EDUCATION.

01:48:48.054 --> 01:48:48.889
AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE'RE

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:52.592
CONCERNED. EVERY EVERYTHING

01:48:52.659 --> 01:48:52.993
ELSE HAS COMMENSAL

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:55.862
COMMENSURATELY GROW. WHICH IS

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:57.497
REVENUES HAVE DOUBLED THE

01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:58.765
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAS

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:01.835
DOUBLED. BUT THE MISSION THE

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:04.771
SUPPORTING UP THE MISSION TO

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:09.175
EDUCATION HASN'T. SO IT DOESN'T

01:49:09.242 --> 01:49:10.377
THINK AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE THE

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:13.113
ORGANIZATION HAS SUCCESSFULLY

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.881
INCREASED THEIR ENTERPRISE

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:17.250
WITHOUT REALLY FOR FILLING

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:17.784
THEIR CORE MISSION TO THE

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:21.788
EXTENT THAT THE SHOT. SO I

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:22.389
THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:23.990
THAT THAT IS A MAJOR. A MAJOR

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:27.360
MAJOR ISSUE. GERMAN YOUR POINT

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.428
IS WELL TAKEN IT'S SOMETHING

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:30.330
THAT WE CONSIDER VERY SERIOUSLY

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.364
I CAN TELL YOU LOOKING AT THE

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:32.966
NUMBERS OVER THE YEARS THAT.

01:49:33.033 --> 01:49:33.533
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAVE

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.869
REMAINED ABOUT 12% SO I THINK

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:40.040
THAT. I THINK YOU BETTER DO

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:43.977
ENOUGH AGAIN DOES NOT IN TERMS

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:44.577
OF WHEN YOU GET THAT 12% IT'S

01:49:44.644 --> 01:49:47.080
NOT LOOKING TO FACTORY. THIS IN

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:47.580
TERMS OF WHAT YOU CALL A

01:49:47.647 --> 01:49:48.114
MINISTRY OF EXPENSES TOTAL

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:51.952
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IT'S

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.687
ABOUT TWELVE AND A FEW POINTS.

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.088
ANY TO THE LAST FISCAL YEAR

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:57.157
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU EXCLUDE

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:58.458
PRICES AND THAT YOU GET LIKE

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.160
PRICES IN THAT MANY DEDICATION

01:50:00.226 --> 01:50:01.328
OF THE YES FOR CLARIFICATION

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:03.196
PRIZE EXPENSES NOT MENTION

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:04.130
EXPENSE THAT'S A COST OF DOING

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:07.567
BUSINESS. SO IF THE INITIAL

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:08.802
EXPENSES ARE WHAT WE CARE

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.737
RETAILERS WHAT WE PAY OUR ARE

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:12.138
GAINING PROVIDERS AND THEY'RE

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:16.076
AND THEY'RE 12% OF ONE NUMBER.

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:16.710
THAT TOTAL REVENUES DAHLE SALES

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:21.815
REVENUE. TOTAL PERCEPTUAL CELLS

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:22.382
REVIEW WHEN SHE TOOK OUT THE

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:26.786
PRIZE MONEY. THE BOSS SAYS IN

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:27.420
THE PRESS MOODY'S CELLS REVENUE

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:30.724
IS JUST PURELY WHAT WE TAKE IN

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:31.324
ON THE SALE OF THE PRODUCTS SO

01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:33.093
THAT'S BEFORE WE PAY OFF PRICES.

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:37.697
MAYBE I CAN HELP ON ON THAT ONE.

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:38.565
MR MAYBE I CAN HELP ON THAT ONE

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:39.299
SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.367
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NUMBERS FOR

01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:41.768
EXAMPLE AM I THINK THE WAY THAT

01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:43.837
IT BREAKS DOWN IS SIXTY FOUR

01:50:43.903 --> 01:50:46.039
POINT ABOUT 64% WENT TO PRIZES

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:49.209
ABOUT 24% WENT TO EDUCATION AND

01:50:49.275 --> 01:50:50.477
THEN ABOUT 12% WENT TO

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:53.780
EXPENSES. SO THAT COMES OFF OF

01:50:53.847 --> 01:50:56.816
THE TOTAL SALE NUMBER. OKAY

01:50:56.883 --> 01:51:07.060
DOES THAT HELP YES. I SEE YOUR

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:09.029
PIERCING SO TOTAL PERCENT.

01:51:09.095 --> 01:51:09.929
RIGHT AND MISTER SHERMAN WE

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:12.432
BELIEVE THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN.

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:14.768
ROUGHLY FLAT IN THE LAST DECADE

01:51:14.834 --> 01:51:16.236
TWELVE POINT SOMETHING PERCENT

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:17.670
IN EACH OF THE LAST ROUGHLY TEN

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:20.840
TO TWELVE FISCAL YEARS. AND

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:22.976
AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT

01:51:23.043 --> 01:51:23.676
THERE ISN'T ROOM FOR

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:25.912
IMPROVEMENT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:26.679
OUR MISSION WHICH IS TO

01:51:26.746 --> 01:51:28.415
MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:29.282
IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN SAVE

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:31.851
SOME MONEY DOING IT. BY DOING

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:32.919
THINGS BETTER EITHER

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:34.120
HEADQUARTERS AROUND THE STATE

01:51:34.187 --> 01:51:35.488
WE WANT TO DO THAT YEAH BUT

01:51:35.555 --> 01:51:37.657
YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A IT'S UP.

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.793
12% WHEN REVENUES HAVE MORE

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:42.328
THAN DOUBLED SO IN ESSENCE WHAT

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:43.496
IS 12% YOUR EXPENSES HAVE MORE

01:51:43.563 --> 01:51:46.066
THAN DOUBLED. AND THERE'S A

01:51:46.132 --> 01:51:48.968
QUESTION IF THE BULK OF YOUR

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:52.505
REVENUE IS REALLY GOING TO

01:51:52.572 --> 01:51:56.576
PRICES IS FROM AN

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:57.210
ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCY POINT

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:57.644
OF VIEW IS A REALLY

01:51:57.710 --> 01:51:59.979
ORGANIZATION FISH. BECAUSE

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:00.413
AGAIN IT'S JUST THE

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.916
ADMINISTRATION THE ADDITIONAL

01:52:02.982 --> 01:52:04.751
PRICE MONEY WELL IT DOES COST A

01:52:04.818 --> 01:52:05.618
LOTTERY MORE TO SELL MORE

01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:07.487
PRIZES AND BIGGER PRICES THE

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:09.823
TRUTH YES SO DO I AM SAMPLE OF

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.991
THAT IS IT'S ESSENTIALLY WITHIN

01:52:12.058 --> 01:52:14.627
OUR GAMING OUR PRIMARY GAMING%

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:16.129
SYSTEM UNDER WITHIN THE

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.564
CONTRACT ITSELF IS SPECIFIES A

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:18.998
FIXED PERCENTAGE OF SALES THAT

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:21.901
GO TOWARD THE VENDOR. SIMILARLY

01:52:21.968 --> 01:52:23.670
AS DOCTOR JOHNSON EXPLAINS THE

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:25.405
RETAILERS ESSENTIALLY GET A

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.073
FIXED PERCENTAGE PURSUANT TO

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.175
WATER REGULATIONS OF EVERY

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:32.412
TICKET THEY SELL AND SOME OF

01:52:32.479 --> 01:52:32.979
THE EVERY EVERY TICKET THAT

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:34.013
THEY CASH EVERY WINNING TICKET

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.316
FOR THE CASH SO THOSE ARE KIND

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:37.584
OF FIXED PERCENTAGES OF OUR

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:41.754
SALES. RIGHT OFF THE TOP WITHIN

01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:46.659
ADMINISTRATION. I JUST TO GO

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:48.027
OVER PHYSICIAN I THINK YOU'RE

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:50.130
AFTER COME BACK AND I THINK

01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:51.464
TAKE I THOUGHT YOU HAD TAKEN A

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:51.998
CHANCE TO TAKE A- LITTLE

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:54.701
LONGER. CLOSER LOOK AT ALL YOUR

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.536
DIFFERENT EXPENSES COULD DOES.

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:59.105
DOES BEG THE QUESTION AS TO

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:00.473
WHETHER OR NOT ORGANIZATION IS

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.808
REALLY SERVING IT'S REAL

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:05.145
MISSION. RATHER THAN IT'S JUST

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:06.713
BECOME A GAMING OPERATIONS THAT

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:08.848
DONATES ONE POINT SIX BILLION

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:09.449
DOLLARS TO EDUCATION. BECAUSE

01:53:09.516 --> 01:53:11.551
THAT'S WHAT FEELS MORE TO ME.

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:13.052
BUT IT'S A GAMING OPERATION

01:53:13.119 --> 01:53:15.555
THAT MAKES A DONATION. NOT

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:16.389
THINK A GAMING OPERATION THAT'S

01:53:16.456 --> 01:53:19.159
REALLY FOCUSED ON. GENERATING

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:19.792
MORE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS WHICH IS

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:25.632
WHICH IS REALLY. THE PURPOSE.

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.367
YEAH THE SCRIPTS OF THIS ON

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:29.068
THAT SAME LINE OF QUESTIONING I

01:53:29.135 --> 01:53:30.603
GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS AS FAR

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:33.773
AS YOUR EMPLOYEE COST I WOULD

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.408
ASSUME THAT IF YOU'VE HAD A

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:37.544
LONG TERM EMPLOYEES THAT THOSE

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:40.046
COSTS HAVE GONE UP JUST. YOU

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:40.613
KNOW WHETHER IT BE BENEFITS

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.583
WHETHER IT BE. SO AS WE LOOK AT

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:47.220
THAT. WITH HOW MANY EMPLOYEES

01:53:47.287 --> 01:53:49.756
DO YOU HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:50.490
FORTY FIVE CIVIL SERVICE

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.926
EMPLOYEES SO THAT ALSO IS

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:54.661
PROBABLY GOING TO BE ADDING

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:57.997
INTO THAT COST EVERY YEAR. THAT

01:53:58.064 --> 01:54:00.733
THE AGENCY IS OPERATING AS THE

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.203
COSTS OF HAVING SUBSTANTIAL

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:06.472
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IS THAT

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:09.776
ADDED IN THERE MISTER KING. ARE

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:10.910

OUR EMPLOYEES CALL. AND ALL

THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING. AND

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:26.492
NOW IT'S GONE UP EVERY YEAR OR

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:28.795
PROBABLY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO.

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:32.398
IT HAS GONE UP OVER THE TEN

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:34.567
