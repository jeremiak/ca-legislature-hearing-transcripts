Granted that we got for a Granted that we got for a Granted that we got for a climate beneficial vineyard climate beneficial vineyard climate beneficial vineyard manager practices. manager practices. manager practices. We have a new concept of soil We have a new concept of soil We have a new concept of soil health in the past we always health in the past we always health in the past we always talked about so quality is bein. talked about so quality is bein. talked about so quality is bein. Important to the vineyard and Important to the vineyard and Important to the vineyard and that basically said okay what is that basically said okay what is that basically said okay what is a plan need to grow well. And we a plan need to grow well. And we a plan need to grow well. And we change that that discussion a change that that discussion a change that that discussion a little bit probably in the last little bit probably in the last little bit probably in the last ten years to talk a bit more ten years to talk a bit more ten years to talk a bit more about soil health. about soil health. about soil health. So hell takes on also the So hell takes on also the So hell takes on also the context of what's going on in context of what's going on in context of what's going on in the environment so what are we the environment so what are we the environment so what are we doing for the watershed what are doing for the watershed what are doing for the watershed what are we doing for. we doing for. Balancing carbon dioxide in the Balancing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and soil. And wood atmosphere and soil. And wood atmosphere and soil.

Meaning this as well as what's Meaning this as well as what's Meaning this as well as what's good for the vines. good for the vines. good for the vines. So it turns out as the So it turns out as the So it turns out as the technology behind this is fairly technology behind this is fairly technology behind this is fairly simple but not widely simple but not widely simple but not widely implemented basically we'd like implemented basically we'd like implemented basically we'd like to do is keep ourselves covers to do is keep ourselves covers to do is keep ourselves covers much as possible so owes very much as possible so owes very much as possible so owes very much like your skin when you much like your skin when you much like your skin when you exposed to the sun.

To put an competing back To put an competing back To put an competing back bacteria that would allow the bacteria that would allow the bacteria that would allow the ice nuclear is to grow. So well ice nuclear is to grow. So well ice nuclear is to grow. So well I'm working a doctor Stephen no I'm working a doctor Stephen no I'm working a doctor Stephen no from UC Berkeley on this and from UC Berkeley on this and from UC Berkeley on this and where second years of testing. where second years of testing. where second years of testing. And. And. And. Like most the time what a ride Like most the time what a ride Like most the time what a ride work on disease passed another work on disease passed another work on disease passed another conditions of I have a plague on conditions of I have a plague on conditions of I have a plague on the study it doesn't show up.
