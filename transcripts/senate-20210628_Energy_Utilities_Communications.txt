ELEVEN HUNDRED AND WE HAVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGUILAR CURRY HERE- ON A BILL RELATED TO COMMUNICATION SERVICE EMERGENCIES DISASTERS REPORTS. WELCOME SOME REMEMBER WHAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SEVEN POINTS OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS AS OFTE AS AMENDMENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF. ACTING THAT LANGUAGE I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A B. ELEVEN HUNDRED WHICH REQUIRES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK STRUCTURE. AFTER EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. THE WILDFIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BECAUSE A MASSIVE DESERT DEVASTATION. HIS NAME A MASSIVE DEFICIT THE DEVASTATION FROM PROPERTY LOSS TO TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS THE DAMAGE. MANY PEOPLE REPORTED THAT THE MOBILE PHONES WENT DARK AND INTERNET SERVICE WENT OUT TO CELL TOWERS WERE DAMAGED AN UNDERGROUND FIBER LINES BURNED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AN ONLINE SURVEY FOUND THAT 64% OF RESPONDENTS IN CINEMA COUNTY AS WILDFIRE AFFECTED AREAS LOST LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE. JUST LAST YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY WELL THE GLASS REPORTEDLY DAMAGED TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING DISRUPTIONS AND PHONE SERVICE IN THE AFFECTED AREA. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE DEVASTATING FIRES THE STATE AND THE P. U. C. OUR FOCUS HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THIS MASSIVE DESTRUCTION. EVEN TODAY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS. HAVE HAD UNTIL TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. HUNGRY RECOVERY PLANS ARE NOT SHARED WITH THE P. U. C. OR THE LEGISLATURE WHOSE JOB IT IS TO OVERSEE THESE COMPANIES AND REPRESENT THE PUBLIC INTEREST. ALL WE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENTS ARE HELPING IN THIS REPAIR EFFORT AND NOT IMPEDING RESTORATION. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED REQUIRES THE PC TO COLLECT INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER EMERGENCIES OR DISASTERS. I WANT TO STRESS THAT THE BILLS REQUIRED REPORTING IS NOT MANDATED TO BE SUBMITTED DURING THE EMERGENCIES THEMSELVES BUT IT IS INSTEAD A LOOK BACK TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR WORKING TOGETHER. TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS IN THE SHORT TERM DURING EMERGENCIES AND APPROPRIATE SERVICE TO SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES AFTER THE DISASTER IN THE LONG TERM. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE REGULATORS AND THE PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR INFORMED OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICE FAILURES AND NETWORK DAMAGE AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS. WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION REGARDING THE METHODS AND TECHNOLOGY USED TO REBUILD THERE IS NO WAY TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME OR IMPROVED ACCESS TO RELIABLE NETWORK. FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS RELIABLE VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICE IS NECESSARY TO REACH NINE ONE ONE. WITHOUT IT THE ABILITY TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES IS LIMITED LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT.

VERY WELL- WILL COME TO THE FLOOR MEMBERS OF THE FLOOR ANYBODY. WISHING TO MAKE COMMENTS OR MAKE A MOTION. US SENATOR BAKER IF I HAD A QUESTION I KNOW THERE'S A MEMORANDUM CONFIDENTIALITY- COMMUTE. TALK ABOUT THAT A MINUTE. THE WELL THE TELECOMMUNICATION PEOPLE A PARTICULAR AGENCY ONE MEASURES CAN REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL THE ON THE BILL WE MADE SURE THAT THEIR INFORMATION WOULD BACK IT UP. ARE THE IMPORTANT PIECE HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CPUC HAS REPORT THAT COMES OUT TO US ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE BARRIERS ARE WHY THEY ARE NOT REPORTING IT THE TIMELY MANNER- AS WELL AS TO MAKE SURE THAT- GOVERNMENT IN OUR TELECOMMUNICATION PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER- IT COULD BE OUR FAULT JUST YOU KNOW MAY BE MADE MAYBE ARE FAR FROM PUTTING UP. BARRIERS OR COULD BE THE US THE CARRIERS. BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT WITHOUT THE INFORMATION. KIND OF AT THE MOMENT DOES- THE ADDRESS IS CONFIDENTIALITY OR TO GIVE THE CPC THIRTY DETERMINE THAT OME DATA MUST BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL ST WITH YEAH THERE IS IT DOES HAVE TO REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL TRYING TO FIND IT HERE IN THE BILL. BUT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY THAT IF IT IF IT SAYS SOME DATA MUST. GIVE US IF YOU SURF ALREADY WERE. IT YOU KNOW APPEARS TO ME THE PRICE OF REQUIRE CONFIDENTIAL GOING FORWARD BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU. DID ADDRESS THAT YEAH. IF THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNED ON ON THIS TRACK IS THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY PIECE FOR OUR PROVIDERS IS AT MOST AND WE MAINTAIN INTENDED MAINTAINED THAT THE KEY IS THAT THE IF WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ON WE'RE FINDING THAT MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S BEEN EMERGENCY IT TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET- THEIR SERVICE BACK AND I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING OUR CONSTITUENTS WANT TO KNOW IS THAT THE FIRST THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT PUTTING IN BARRIERS. OR IS THAT THE- PROVIDERS PUTTING IN THE BEARS ARE GETTING THAT IN TIMELY MAKING SURE IT IS ADEQUATE IF NOT BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT THAT DATA RIGHT NOW. M. A. D. YOU WANT TO MAKE A PAYMENT TO THAT THE AMENDMENTS WE PUT IT DOES REMOVE THE- OPPOSITION FROM AT&amp;T. AND LIKE USUAL I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CENTERED AROUND. WITH MOTION SENATOR- BRADFORD THANK YOU I JUST WANT A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY IT STATES ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT- REPLACE SCENE- DAMAGE EQUIPMENT BY WILDFIRE WHEN INFERIOR TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT STATUTE THAT'S A LEGAL SO. WORSE IS TAKING PLACE- I'LL HAVE ONE OF MY- EXPERT WITNESSES EXPLAINED WHERE THAT IS TAKING PLACE. THE BLUES COULD ANSWER THAT OR BRENDA. DO WE HAVE A AND TO BE ANOTHER LIST SORENSEN ON THE LINE STILL. BUT APPARENTLY NOT. ANOTHER ARE INDEFINITELY TURN. YES GO AHEAD PLEASE GO TO. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK THIS IS THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS HERE IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WHAT IS MEANT YOU KNOW IF NEEDED TO BE A TEMPORARY SOLUTION TEMPORARY FIX- AND IT MAY NOT BE THE SAME SERVICE AS BEFORE. BUT IT STILL FROM TERRORISTS IS NOT CONTINUED IN THE LONG TERM- AND- IT DOESN'T END ANY. PRACTICE REFLECTION CONNECTING THE NATION'S SERVICE BY WHICH THE ENGINE IT IS NOT A LOT SO THIS WOULD BE A WAY THAT TE CPC AND A LEGISLATURE CAN ENSURE THAT THAT COMMUNITY- THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE NEEDS AND IN FACT. REVEALING WHAT IS WHAT IS BEING DONE SO THAT THERE IS NO- CONTINUATION IN SERVICE WITHOUT. THE APPROPRIATE PROCESS. I'M STILL LOOKING FOR- IF IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN UNDER CURRENT STATUTE STATES THAT YOU CANNOT REPLACE- APPOINTMENT WITH INFERIOR TECHNOLOGY I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE FOR. CENTER BRAD WHAT AN IDIOT FIND ME I GET. A PIECE OF BREAD. THANK YOU FIND ME ON. THAT THAT IS THE I GUESS WE'RE CONFIRMING THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE- THAT SO IT'S A WAY TO PREVIEW WHAT IS TO BE. I THINK GENERALLY THE QUESTION IS IT NOT ALLOWED NOW AND IF IT ISN'T ALLOWED. WHAT IS THIS HOW DOES THE BILL THIS BILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THAT SAID FURTHER ADDRESS IT DOES IT- RESTATED OR IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHAT CAUSES IT NOT TO BE ALLOWED IT I JUST JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION IF. YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. YES MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IT IS NOT ALLOWED AND IN IN. A LOT RIGHT NOW AND THE BILL WOULD BE A WAY TO CHECK. THAT THE PROVIDER IS NOT DOING THAT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO WAY TO REALISTICALLY AND PRACTICALLY CHECK. THAT OUT THERE THAT THIS PRACTICE ISN'T- ISN'T HAPPENING. AND CULD YOU AT LEAST TO PROVIDE US SOME LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS BILL WOULD DO THAT WHAT. WHAT IS THE ACTUAL. CONTROL THAT'S PUT INTO PLACE. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. YES THE BILL- OKAY WHEN WE TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE AT THE PNC WOULD COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENT RIGHT ABOUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT KIND OF THING- FISHERIES ARE ARE PUT IN PLACE AFTER THAT THE FIX IS IN PLACE WITH A PERMANENT. PERMANENT FACILITY. SO WE WOULD KNOW OR I SHOULD SAY THE PC IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH AND NOW IN THAT AREA WELL THAT WAS- YOU KNOW WHICH ONE- FIBROUS PUT IN PLACE. OR WAS IT SOMETHING ELSE. RIGHT AND YOU COULD CHECK WHILE THAT AREA SHOULD BE SERVICE AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SERVICED I THANK. AND I'M BEING VERY SIMPLISTIC HERE BUT FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY TO I GUESS REVIEW OR I WOULD SAY ABOUT IT. THANK YOU TO CHECK OUT THE COMMUNITY IS SERVICED BY THE SAME ACTOR SEEMS STANDARD THAT IT WAS BEFORE. ARE YOU SATISFIED CENTER RESTAURANT. SO NO BUT HE'LL MOVE ON OKAY SO I WILL JUST WANNA DISS SAY ANECDOTALLY I'VE BEEN AT MANY TIMES AFTER FIRES IN WAITING WAITING FOR PEOPLE THEN WE GET LOTS OF PHONE CALLS AND OF MY CONSTITUENTS BUT LACKING SERVICE WHAT IS GET GET THE GET THE SERVICE BACK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME SERVICE THAT THEY HAD BEFORE. SO THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE CAN ENSURE THE TORAH CONSTITUENTS THAT WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE IF NOT BETTER SHOULD BE GOING IN AND I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A WAY OF ANY KIND OF DATA AND THIS IS A WAY TO UP FRONT PROVIDE DATA TO SEE IF YOU SEE IT WE CAN DO FOLLOW UP WITH THIS BUT- THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IS THAT AFTER FIRE AND WEATHER SO FAR EARTHQUAKE WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT. YOU WILL FIND THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE ACCURATE DATA THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE SURE CONSTITUENTS ARE CONNECTED. THANK YOU- WE DO IT- CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU RICHARD I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ISN'T THAT WHAT. THE RATE PAYERS PAY TURN TO DO IS TO. EVAN TO INVESTIGATE. WHAT THESE SITUATIONS I BELIEVE THAT TURN IS ACTUALLY WE USE RATEPAYERS FUNDS OF THEIR NON- WHAT ARE THEY THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NON POLITICAL OR NON PARTISAN AND THEY THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE LOOKING OUT FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND THAT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LACKING THE SERVICE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT TURNED. JOB IS TO ACTUALLY DO. YES AND THE ACTUAL THE PERSON RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION IS FROM TURNER BRENDA BE ADVISED THAT TURN NEEDED THE INFORMATION. AS WELL. THIS IS- I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR OKAY SURE. CENTER GROVE. I THANK YOU MR CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE OPPOSITION ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CABLE TO MATT TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION THE BILL WOULD DIVERT FOCUS FROM RESTORING SERVICE AND NECESSARILY- AN UNNECESSARILY INTERJECT THE C. P. U. C. IN THE REAL TIME PROCESS AND WE HAD A DEVASTATING FIRE IN MY DISTRICT LIKE MANY OTHER DISTRICTS. IN BEING DOWN AT COMMANDCENTER- I CAN IMAGINE THEM STOPPING WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO HELP RESTORE POWER TO INDIVIDUALS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND HAVING TO FILL OUT REPORTS- THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF IT'S OKAY FOR THE CHAIR FOR BURNING ARRESTS A RISK OF FROM C. C. T. EIGHT TO EXPAND ON HIS OPPOSITION BECAUSE I DIDN'T. UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF HIS COMMENT WAS. HE STILL ON THE LINE DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR HIM YES WHAT IS HIS- CAN YOU EXPAND ON OPPOSITION THAT HE HAS AND WHAT HE FEELS IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE OR THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT- SUPPLIERS. OR PROVIDERS. YES PLEASE IT HAS ON THE LINE AND- LEADER OF I JUST WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION ON A SEPARATE MATTER. I HAVE THAT THERE'S THREE PLEXIGLASS BETWEEN YOU AND I AND THERE'S A GLARE. SO NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO SPEAK MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME A LITTLE HAND WAVE A GESTURE BECAUSE- I'M NOT GOT IT SIR I'M SORRY BOUT THAT NO MISTER TERRACE MY VISION I JUST THOUGHT YOU LIKE SENATOR DOLLY BETTER THAN ME. THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. MR LITTLE SCHOOL THE GOSPEL MOSCOW. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN A CENTER GROVE- FOR THAT QUESTION- THE INTERJECTION HERE IS THIS INFORMATION THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IS ALREADY COLLECTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN SENATOR MCGUIRE TERROR LEGISLATION ABOUT NETWORK OUTAGES AND THIS IS FOR CAL- YES EVERY TIME THERE'S AN OUTAGE. EVERY TIME NOT JUST DURING A MAJOR DISASTERS SO WE HAVE TO NOTIFY TELL- YES ABOUT THAT A RICH WHAT CAUSES HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE OUT WHEN WILL IT BE RESTORED SO INFORMATION ABOUT NETWORK OUTAGES IS BEING COLLECTED TODAY AND THAT'S BEING COLLECTED BY CAL OVER YET I JUST WANTED YOU TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION RELATED TO FIRES IF YOU COULD WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS CASE THE INFORMATION THAT FOR RESTORATIONS DURING A FIRE WOULD BE PROVIDED TO CAL- YES. OKAY A SECOND QUESTION MISTER CHAIR TOO AND THE OPPOSITION IF HE CAN ANSWER IT IS AN SO YOU JUST SAID I'M JUST CONFIRMING THE DATA IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED AND IT'S PROVIDED TO CAL- YES IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RESTRICTS IN THAT BILL THAT YOU REFERENCED A MISTER WIRE- THAT RESTRICTS CALLIE- YES TO SHARE WITH THE C. P. U. C. SO THAT DATA DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DUPLICATED. YES- SENATOR GROUPS STATUTORILY AS TWENTY EIGHT AND TWENTY NINETEEN THAT SP SIX SEVENTY. HOUSES INFORMATION KEPT CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE IT'S CRITICAL INFORMATION CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION. SO IT IS PURPOSELY KEPT CONFIDENTIAL IT CAN ONLY BE SURE TO LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. TO GIVE THEM SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ABOUT THE- COLLEGE OF THAT NETWORK. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES KNOW THAT NINE ONE ONE CALLS CANNOT BE MADE. AND SO DURING THAT ENTIRE DURATION WE MUST KEEP TO- YES INFORMED ABOUT THAT OUTAGE. SO THAT'S THE ONLY SITUATION WHERE CAVALIERS CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD THAT I DIDN'T ASK YOU. NO SIR THANK YOU MA'AM OKAY. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE THIS IS A RECORDING BILL SO I THINK GENERAL SENATOR STERN DID YOU HAVE A- I JUST WANT TO MOVE THE BILL. OKAY YEAH THIS IS REPORTING BUILDING GENERALLY. WHAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS WHETHER THIS INFORMATION SEEMS GOING TO BE PROVIDED AND IF WE CAN- ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT IS BEING CONTINUED TO BE USED AFTER. HIS REPLACEMENT OR WHETHER- THE- THE EQUIPMENT THEY WERE USING STUDENTS JOB. BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALL INFANTS BILL NOT WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL ASK THE- WE'RE GONNA OUT DID YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I THINK IT'S ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE- PROBABLY GONNA ASK I WANTED OFF THE AUTO TO SEE TO GET HER PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. THEY JUST STATED IT SOUNDS. LIKE THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING TO THAT I'M GONNA LET HER DO THAT AND- K. THANK YOU. AND I'M GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN OUR CLOSING STATEMENT AS WELL. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT THE MOTION THE SECOND PLACED ON THE FLOOR HERE. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER MEMBER. SERIK MAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I GUESS ALONG THOSE LINES OF DUPLICATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S OR TRY TO AVOID IS DUPLICATION- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I. THAT I DIDN'T HEAR IS THAT THE QUALITY THAT IS HOPE BACKED UP IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT DATA IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED. JUST HOW WENT DOWN HOW LONG THAT WANTED TO GET BACK UP. BUT NOT THAT IT WAS AT THE PREVIOUS LEVEL IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND. EXACTLY. AND I'LL TELL HER I HAVE HER ADDRESS AT OUR CLOSING COMMENTS AS WELL- THAT'S COMPETITIVE. SO- SO- ASSEMBLYMEMBER CURRY IF YOU COULD MAKE YOUR CLOSING STATEMENTS I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION YEAH ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS AFTER THE FACT THIS ISN'T REAL TIME INFORMATION WE NEED WE NEED TO FIND OUT AFTER THE FACT HOW THAT WAS RESTORED IT WAS RESTORED IN A TIMELY FASHION IF IT WAS USED WITH- BETTER OR- NOT THIS TOP QUALITY- FIBER. OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS WAS INSTALLED BEFORE- WE'VE GOT SO TO MANY CALLS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS SAYING WE HAD IT BEFORE OR BETTER AND NOW IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE SENATE BILL INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IS ACTUALLY ACCURATE AND THE DATA IS THERE. AGAIN THIS IS JUST FOR NOT GOING AFTER INDUSTRY WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER ANYONE WE'RE MAKING SURE OUR DISTRICTS ARE TAKEN CARE OF- I DON'T WANT TO HAVE BARRIERS FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. I JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. AND LOOKING AT THE DATA AND HOW WE ARE PROGRESSING AS IMPORTANT. AND I WAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS ARE NOT PUTTING UP BARRIERS AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE QUALITY COMMUNICATIONS IN OUR DISTRICTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND THEN WE HAVE A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION. CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THE BILL RELATED TO WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM CORPORATIONS THE CONSOLIDATION OF SERVICE WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT TWELVE FIFTY WOULD SET STATUTORY TIMELINES FOR THE COMPLETION OF WATER SYSTEM CONSOLIDATIONS THAT REQUIRE CPC APPROVAL. CURRENTLY MANY COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER BECAUSE THEY BELONG TO WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE UNABLE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY WATER SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION HAS PROVEN TO BE A SOLUTION. TO MAKING SURE THESE COMMUNITIES RECEIVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER UNFORTUNATELY THE LONGER REVIEW TAKES THE LONGER CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT WITH UNDRINKABLE WATER AND RAPIDLY DETERIORATING WATER SYSTEM. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO HELP EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATIONS AND THEY NEED TO ENSURE. THAT REPAIR COSTS ARE REASONABLE. I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. WITH ME IN SUPPORT TO TESTIFY REMOTELY ON A B. TWELVE FIFTY R. EVAN JACOBS FROM CALIFORNIA AMERICAN WATER AND JUSTIN'S GARB FROM CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE. VERY WELL- SO WE HAVE- SEVEN JACOBS AND JUSTIN'S SCARBOROUGH THERE IS NO NO ONE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION AND ORGANIZE PRESENTATIONS WE'LL ASK THE SPEAKERS TO SPEAK FOR A MINUTE AND A HALF EACH THE TOTAL THREE MINUTES THAT'S OUR GENERAL RULE HERE. IN THIS COMMITTEE BEGINNING WITH EVAN JACOBS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. ELEVEN JACOB IS NOT ON THE LINE TO HELP US JUSTIN SCARRED. I'M HERE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AND IF YOU COULD SPEAK INTO THE PHONE BUT I BELIEVE SO WE CAN HEAR YOU. SURE THING. I HAD CUT OFF ALL TIES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME'S JUSTIN SCARRED AND I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING OUT HERE BEFORE YOU TOAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY CALLED AROUND TO SOME REMEMBER CALLED AROUND EIGHTY TWELVE FIFTY ON BEHALF OF THE CALL CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE STATEWIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS WATER UTILITIES REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- BEFORE GETTING TO THE MEAT OF THE MATTER I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALDERONE SECURING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AS WELFARE STAFF WITH TIME AND EFFORT THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE BILL IS A MYSTERY PROCESS I DON'T FEEL LIKE EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AS ALWAYS IT WAS GREAT WORKING WITH THEM- AS WE APPROACH THE HEARING TODAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW EARLIER EARLIER THIS YEAR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RELEASED ITS NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFIED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED TWENTY WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY FAILING TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER. AND THEN ALSO IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS- THEY WERE AT RISK OF FAILING A CONSISTENT THEME THROUGHOUT THAT ANALYSIS IS THAT THE SYSTEM SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE SCALE NEEDED TO COST EFFECTIVELY MEET THE EVER INCREASING CHALLENGES OF PROVIDING SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND IN SOME CASES WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR THESE SYSTEMS IS TO MERGE WITH A LARGER SYSTEM THAT HAD SUFFICIENT SCALE AND PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF PROVIDING CLEAN RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. CERTAINLY BUILD TWELVE FIFTY WILL HELP ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND SUPPORT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER BY CREATING MORE REGULATORY CERTAINTY FOR THESE TYPES OF INSTANCES WHERE THAT MERGING OR CONSOLIDATION OF WATER SYSTEMS MAKES THE MOST SENSE. I MEAN IF YOU CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH A LARGER WATER SUPPLIER REGULATED BY THE COMMISSION THEY SHOULD HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO KNOW THAT THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETE IN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT THEIR RESIDENTS CAN START ENJOYING SAFE DRINKING WATER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE MISTERS GARDENS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU IF YOU COULD STAY ON THE LINE SIR I'M GONNA CHECK ONE MORE TIME IF EVAN JACOBS IS AVAILABLE IF HE'S NOT I'LL I'LL GIVE YOU HIS. SPEAKING TIME. IS SEVEN JACOBS ON OKAY. I WOULD. SEVEN NOW THAN MISTER SCAR GIVE YOU THE- OF MR- JACOB TIME IF YOU WANNA CONTINUE SPEAK. I HAVE JUST ONE MORE THING I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AB TWELVE FIFTY SEVEN PROPOSES A MODEST PROCEDURAL IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SMALL RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES KNOWN AS INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS I L. E. C. S. AS THESE ARE FULLY REGULATED BY THE CPUC. CURRENTLY THE PC IS REQUIRING THAT THE SMALL RURAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES SERVING THE HARDEST TO REACH AREAS MUST FILE A FORMAL RAPE CASE WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY FOR BOTH THE C. P. C. M. THESE TELEPHONE COMPANIES. FOR THIRTY YEARS THESE RATE CASES WERE SUBMITTED AND COMPLETED THROUGH A MORE INFORMAL PROCESS KNOWN AS AN ADVICE LETTER. THESE ADVICE LETTERS ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED BY THE CPUC FOR THESE RATE CASES ALTHOUGH MANY SMALL WATER COMPANIES. AND EVEN SMALL ELECTRIC COMPANIES CONTINUE TO USE THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS. AB ONE TWO FIVE SEVEN PROPOSES TO EXPEDITE THE FORMAL PROCESS. BY HAVING A DAY OF MEDIATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE USING THE CPU SEES EXISTING ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS. AND TO MEET AND CONFER PRIOR TO BRINGING ANY MOTION. THAT THIS MODEST CHANGE WOULD CREATE MORE EFFICIENCY IN THE RAPE CASE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT THESE COMPANIES MUST FILE. EVERY FIVE YEARS.

THE BURDENSOME RATE CASE PROCESS. AND MEETING FOR ME PICKING UP THE PHONE AND HAVING A FIVE TO TEN MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL BEFORE FILING A MOTION.

IN THE FINAL RATE CASE PROCESS IF THE WINDOWS TIME BEFORE EVIDENTIARY HEARING MEN IN WHICH THE PARTIES CAN ENGAGE IN SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS. IF THERE'S NO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ONE DAY OF NONBINDING MEDIATIONS WELL WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT MEDIATION WILL SEE.
