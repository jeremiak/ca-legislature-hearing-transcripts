OUR MAJOR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL

LARGEST CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE

THAT THERE IS OFTEN A STEREO

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:20.005 region:rollup2

THAT THIS BILL CONTINUES TO

00:32:28.914 --> 00:32:33.752 region:rollup2
PERPETUATE THAT.

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:35.520 region:rollup2
BIAS AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOT

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:37.856 region:rollup2
ONLY FOR THE ISSUE OF GUN

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.824 region:rollup2

THAT.

TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:36.948 region:rollup2

FOR FINDING A PERSON AS.

00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:42.587 region:rollup2
AS A DANGER.

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:45.357 region:rollup2
I UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL.

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:47.292 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A LIFETIME BAN ONLY ON

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:49.294 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH A HISTORY OF MENTAL

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
ILLNESS AND AS.

00:33:49.294 --> 00:33:52.230 region:rollup2
MR CHILD HAS SAID IT

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:53.732 region:rollup2
STIGMATIZES PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.867 region:rollup2
ILLNESS IT PERPETUATES THIS

00:33:53.732 --> 00:33:57.702 region:rollup2
HARMFUL AND FALSE STEREOTYPE

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:59.271 region:rollup2
THAT SUCH PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY

00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:00.839 region:rollup2
VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS.

00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.873 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THAT THE VAST

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:03.842 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO COMMIT

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:06.544 region:rollup2
VIOLENT CRIMES I DO NOT HAVE

00:34:03.842 --> 00:34:08.480 region:rollup2
MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO NOT ONLY.

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:10.949 region:rollup2
IS THIS BILL UNFAIRLY

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.651 region:rollup2
STIGMATIZING BUT ALSO AND WOULD

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.419 region:rollup2
BE INEFFECTIVE AT ACTUALLY

00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:15.620 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING VIOLENT CRIME.

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:17.422 region:rollup2
.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.757 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.557 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE OF MAN'S BUT WE

00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:22.027 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.627 region:rollup2
ANOTHER STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:24.462 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:25.931 region:rollup2
AT A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:28.767 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO

00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:29.467 region:rollup2
INITIATE AN ACTION TO EXTEND THE

00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:31.603 region:rollup2
BAN.

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:32.570 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WITH THE BURDEN WOULD

00:34:31.603 --> 00:34:32.971 region:rollup2
FALL ON THE GOVERNMENT RATHER

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.441 region:rollup2
THAN.

00:34:32.971 --> 00:34:38.910 region:rollup2
THAT PRESUMING THAT A PERSON IS

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.712 region:rollup2
FOREVER UNFIT JUST BECAUSE THEY

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.614 region:rollup2
HAVE A HISTORY OF THE OVEN

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:43.348 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE.

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:44.416 region:rollup2
.

00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:45.183 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:47.018 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WOULD PROTECT THE

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:49.020 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND AND SO WE WE DO

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:51.056 region:rollup2
REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.491 region:rollup2

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2
OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.405 region:rollup2
GUN VIOLENCE.

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:16.674 region:rollup2
I AM I WILL BE BRIEF.

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:18.009 region:rollup2
.

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:19.844 region:rollup2
THE OF THE DECISION TO CARRY A

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:21.746 region:rollup2
LOADED.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:24.415 region:rollup2
HIDDEN GUN IN PUBLIC IS A VERY

00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:25.917 region:rollup2
BIG RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARE

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:27.118 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY CAN PUT THE GUN

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:29.153 region:rollup2
CARRYING INDIVIDUAL AND THE

00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:31.656 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AT RISK.

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:33.658 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE VERY LEAST WE

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2
CAN DO IN THAT SITUATION IS TO

00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:36.928 region:rollup2
HAVE A REVIEW EVERY TWO YEARS TO

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:40.064 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT COULD COST

00:41:36.928 --> 00:41:41.299 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO EXIST BECAUSE THAT

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:43.634 region:rollup2
SITUATION MAY CHANGE. AND THAT

00:41:41.299 --> 00:41:45.770 region:rollup2
THE PERSON IS CONTINUES TO BE OF

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:47.572 region:rollup2
GOOD MORAL CHARACTER TO ME

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:49.040 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO. I'VE

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:51.609 region:rollup2
HEARD THIS COMMITTEE SAY MANY

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.882 region:rollup2
ALWAYS SAYS IS THAT.

00:41:55.947 --> 00:42:00.518 region:rollup2
THE SEAS.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:02.153 region:rollup2
ARM THERE ARE OUR CCW LAWS ARE

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.821 region:rollup2
WORKING IN OUR STATE THERE

00:42:02.153 --> 00:42:05.523 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T BEEN A BIG PROBLEM AND

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:07.358 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING LAW IS THAT THERE

00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:08.693 region:rollup2
IS THE REVIEW EVERY TWO YEARS.

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:10.828 region:rollup2
CYBER SUGGESTS THAT WE CONTINUE

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:12.697 region:rollup2
WHAT IS WORKING I WILL NOTE THAT

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:14.999 region:rollup2

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:17.402 region:rollup2

REVOKED THAT'S TRUE THEY WERE

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:27.845 region:rollup2
TRACKED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:28.613 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THIS IS A VERY LEASE

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:31.516 region:rollup2
A PRECAUTION THAT WE HAVE THE

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:33.785 region:rollup2

WITH DNA AND WITH DNA KITS

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:10.341 region:rollup2

OR THE KIDS AND NEVER HAD A

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:25.696 region:rollup2
CHANCE.

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:27.731 region:rollup2
EITHER BECAUSE SOCIETY TOLD HIM

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:29.900 region:rollup2
SO OR EITHER BECAUSE THEIR ZIP

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:30.534 region:rollup2
CODE DETERMINE THE AXIS OF REACH

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.069 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HAVE TO A RESOURCE.

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:33.304 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:34.672 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME

00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:37.141 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS ONCE ONE OF THESE

00:49:34.672 --> 00:49:38.642 region:rollup2
KIDS.

00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
WE TALK ABOUT SECOND CHANCES BUT

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.177 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THE

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:41.111 region:rollup2
NEVER HAD A FIRST ONE TO BEGIN

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:42.913 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:44.782 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS I GREW UP IN

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:46.050 region:rollup2
A HOME THOSE VOTED ABUSE

00:49:44.782 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
WHY WITNESSED ABUSE WERE I WAS

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.019 region:rollup2
ABUSING THAT I WENT TO A SCHOOL

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.888 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT TOLD ME I WAS ALSO

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:52.122 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE NOTHING?

00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:54.959 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WENT TO A SCHOOL

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:55.626 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT ASSUME.

00:49:54.959 --> 00:49:56.193 region:rollup2
THE EVERY I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:49:55.626 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE FIGURED OUT

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:58.529 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE LACK OF RESOURCES

00:49:57.328 --> 00:50:00.264 region:rollup2
SHOWED ME THAT.

00:49:58.529 --> 00:50:01.565 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF RESOURCES TOLD ME

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:03.133 region:rollup2
THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IN

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:04.668 region:rollup2
YOUR HOME IS NORMAL.

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:06.604 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO COME

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:08.172 region:rollup2
AND HELP YOU WITH THOSE ISSUES.

00:50:06.604 --> 00:50:09.740 region:rollup2
SO AS A CHILD TRYING TO FIGURE

00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:11.909 region:rollup2
OUT WHO I WAS OR WHAT I WAS

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.944 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN LIFE OR WHO

00:50:11.909 --> 00:50:16.847 region:rollup2
ARE HOW TO EVEN SURVIVE.

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:17.615 region:rollup2
I FOUND MYSELF FALLING.

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.449 region:rollup2
IN LINE WITH THE ONLY THING I

00:50:17.615 --> 00:50:20.584 region:rollup2
KNEW HOW TO DO WHICH WAS THE

00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:22.453 region:rollup2
GANGS THAT PROVIDED THE SUPPORT

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:24.255 region:rollup2
AND THE LOVE THAT I THOUGHT

00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:26.056 region:rollup2
EXISTED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:50:24.255 --> 00:50:28.025 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:29.793 region:rollup2
TO IN SCHOOLS SO WE TALK ABOUT

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:31.996 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND PREVENTION.

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:33.430 region:rollup2
IT'S IRONIC THAT THE KIDS THAT

00:50:31.996 --> 00:50:35.966 region:rollup2
ARE OFTENTIMES REAP THE MOST

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:37.568 region:rollup2
REPEAT VICTIMS BUT THE KIDS ARE

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:39.236 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THE MOST IN NEED OR

00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:42.039 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAT HAD THE LEAST.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:42.840 region:rollup2
AXIS CITIES RESOURCES.

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.141 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER RECEIVED ITS

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.776 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:46.644 region:rollup2
SO I COME TODAY IN SUPPORT.

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:48.412 region:rollup2
IN A BILL THAT I BELIEVE

00:50:46.644 --> 00:50:51.315 region:rollup2
PROVIDES.

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:54.351 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE TRAUMA RECOVERY.

00:50:51.315 --> 00:50:56.987 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THEM TO

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:57.488 region:rollup2
HAVE A FUTURE AND TO HAVE THAT

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:57.721 region:rollup2
FIRST CHANCE THAT WE ALL

00:50:57.488 --> 00:51:02.326 region:rollup2
DESERVE.

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:03.327 region:rollup2

OF SUPPORT

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:14.438 region:rollup2
THAT AIMS TO PREVENT.

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:15.005 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:16.006 region:rollup2
TO INTERRUPT THE SCHOOL TO

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:19.310 region:rollup2
PRISON PIPELINE.

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEAS THAT WE'RE NOT

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.612 region:rollup2

THERE'S A.

00:51:51.275 --> 00:51:54.478 region:rollup2
A CULTURE SHIFT AT THE SCHOOL.

ENVIRONMENT AND TEACHING

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:04.154 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. SO THAT PEOPLE WHO

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:05.055 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE A FIRST CHANCE OR

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:06.624 region:rollup2
COMING FROM A PLACE WHERE THEY

THE COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IS A

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.906 region:rollup2
THING THAT HAPPENS TO KIDS WHO

00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:26.176 region:rollup2

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:14.725 region:rollup2

CLEARLY AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:53:14.725 --> 00:53:16.326 region:rollup2
OF THE PREMISE BEHIND YOUR BILL

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:18.662 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:19.263 region:rollup2
I WE WANT TO GIVE GREATER ACCESS

NEED IT.

00:53:20.264 --> 00:53:23.267 region:rollup2
I DO HOWEVER HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:23.967 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BREADTH OF THE BILL

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:25.769 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE VERY BROAD

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:27.705 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

00:53:25.769 --> 00:53:29.440 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TARGETS THE VICTIM'S

00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:31.775 region:rollup2
RESTITUTION FINES.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.944 region:rollup2
AS IT'S A. FUNDING SOURCE WHICH

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.445 region:rollup2
IS PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:36.246 region:rollup2
OF THE FUND IS DWINDLING

00:53:34.445 --> 00:53:37.581 region:rollup2
RAPIDLY.

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:39.349 region:rollup2
AND RESEARCH INSOLVENCY IN JUST

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:41.318 region:rollup2
A FEW SHORT YEARS.

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:43.353 region:rollup2
AND THE BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:45.089 region:rollup2
SPECIFY THE BOOKS BEING TREATED.

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:46.256 region:rollup2
ARE TRULY VICTIMS OF CRIME.

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:48.492 region:rollup2
WHICH LEADS TO PROBLEMS WITH

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:50.561 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUND MATCHING.

00:53:48.492 --> 00:53:51.962 region:rollup2

TRACE IS IMPORTANT FOR FOR

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.417 region:rollup2
REASONS

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:08.852 region:rollup2
ONE IS TO GET LEADS.

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:10.186 region:rollup2

CRIME GUNS IN TWO THOUSAND IN

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:33.309 region:rollup2
YEAR TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE IT

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:35.612 region:rollup2
WAS. TRACE DATA FOUND THAT ONE

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:37.347 region:rollup2
GUN DEALER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:39.082 region:rollup2
HALF OF THE CRIME GUNS IN

FORMER SHUT DOWN THOSE DEALERS.

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:47.624 region:rollup2
THEN IN CALIFORNIA I'M GETTING

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:49.759 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION INTO A F.*

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:50.593 region:rollup2
IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR ARMED

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:52.295 region:rollup2
PROHIBITIVE PERSON SYSTEM

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:55.165 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH RELIES ON GOOD

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:57.801 region:rollup2

01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:02.305 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME

PROHIBITED AND AS YOU KNOW DOJ

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:05.341 region:rollup2

DOJ AS FINE AS THEY GO TO

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:09.479 region:rollup2
DISARM.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:10.046 region:rollup2
A PERSON WHO'S IN APPS

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:11.481 region:rollup2
AND THEY DISCOVER THAT LAW

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.248 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT ALREADY HAD BEGUN

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:14.818 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DIDN'T AND HURT TO

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:17.020 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO IT REALLY INTERFERES

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:18.521 region:rollup2
WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR APPS

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.724 region:rollup2

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:29.332 region:rollup2
WHERE A FS THAT DATABASE IS

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:31.000 region:rollup2
COMPARE WITH APPS OF SOMEONE HAS

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:32.936 region:rollup2
A GUN REGISTERED TO THEM AND

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.104 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT IN NAPS AND THEY'RE

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:35.505 region:rollup2
GOOD TO GO AND FIND AMMUNITION

01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:36.806 region:rollup2
WELL THE PAY PERSON MAY NOT

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:38.875 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE THE GUN IT SHOULD

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:40.543 region:rollup2
NOT BE REGISTERED TO THEM? LAW

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:42.645 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT HAS IT SO AGAIN IF

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:45.014 region:rollup2
THAT DATA IS NOT ACCURATE AND

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:47.450 region:rollup2
KEPT UPDATED. OF THEIR COULD BE

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:49.519 region:rollup2
IN RHODIA'S AMMUNITION CELL

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:51.354 region:rollup2
SO WE WANT GOOD DATA IN DOJ

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:53.423 region:rollup2

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:55.492 region:rollup2

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.284 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE THIS BILL WOULD

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.485 region:rollup2
REMOVE THE MICROSCOPIC

01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:44.354 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR NEW MODEL

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:46.089 region:rollup2
HANDGUNS TO BE CERTIFIED FOR

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:47.824 region:rollup2
SALE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:49.292 region:rollup2
MICROSCOPIC A HANDGUN INVOLVES

01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:50.293 region:rollup2
THE IMPRINTING OF A MICROSCOPIC

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.929 region:rollup2
ARRAY OF CHARACTERS THAT

01:08:50.293 --> 01:08:54.330 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE MAKE MODEL AND

01:08:52.929 --> 01:08:56.165 region:rollup2
SERIAL NUMBER OF THE HANDGUN.

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.633 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REQUIRES

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:59.435 region:rollup2
THAT A HANDGUN IS IN PREGNANT

01:08:57.633 --> 01:09:01.371 region:rollup2
CHORE MORE PLACES ON THE

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:03.206 region:rollup2
INTERIOR SERVICE OR ON THE

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:05.008 region:rollup2
WORKING PART OF THE GUN.

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:06.075 region:rollup2
STATE ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:07.744 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING CHARACTERS ARE

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:10.213 region:rollup2
TRANSFERRED ONTO EACH CARTRIDGE

01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:11.514 region:rollup2
CASE WHEN THE FIREARM INSPIRED.

01:09:10.213 --> 01:09:12.882 region:rollup2
WHEN THIS OUT WELL THIS SOUNDS

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.650 region:rollup2
LIKE A GREAT WAY TO BE ABLE TO

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:15.451 region:rollup2
TRACK DOWN FIREARMS WITH THE

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.120 region:rollup2
BULLETS THEY'RE SHOT FROM THEM

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:19.856 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS AT THE MICROSCOPIC

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.024 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT VIABLE. THE

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:22.959 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THAT THE MICROSTATE

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:24.527 region:rollup2
APPEAR TWICE ON THE FIREARMS

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:25.595 region:rollup2
CASING IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:27.597 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:29.232 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION SCIENCES CONFIRMED

01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:30.767 region:rollup2
THAT THE MARKS LEFT BY THE

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:32.301 region:rollup2
INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF A GUN

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:33.636 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALTERED FROM NORMAL USE

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.071 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES THE MICROSCOPIC

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:36.439 region:rollup2
USELESS.

01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:38.341 region:rollup2
IF TECHNOLOGY WAS BOUGHT AT THE

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.609 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WAS VIABLE A CRIMINAL

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.977 region:rollup2
COULD EASILY FILED DOWN THE

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:42.378 region:rollup2
MARKER STAMP AND ELIMINATE ITS

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:43.613 region:rollup2
PURPOSE.

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:45.681 region:rollup2
FOR THE REASONS FOR THESE

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:46.949 region:rollup2
REASONS GUN MANUFACTURERS HAVE

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:49.185 region:rollup2
YET TO EVEN IMPLEMENT THIS

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:50.920 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SINCE NEW HANDGUNS

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:52.188 region:rollup2
ARE UNABLE TO BE MICRO STAMPED

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.623 region:rollup2

THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTION.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.637 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO EXPAND

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.735 region:rollup2
AND MOST FOR A CRIME I JUST

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.202 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.970 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN AGAIN.

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:49.739 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:51.774 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST NOT RELIABLE EVEN IN

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:53.643 region:rollup2
THOSE OPTIMIZE SITUATIONS AND

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:55.344 region:rollup2
CAN EASILY BE DEFEATED WITH WITH

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.878 region:rollup2
A FILE OR SOME HOUSEHOLD GOOD

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:56.546 region:rollup2
WITH THE SHERIFF WILL TALK

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:58.548 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:12:00.383 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WHO SHOULD NOT BE

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.250 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO A LOT THAT'S JUST NOT

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.019 region:rollup2
RELIABLE.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.953 region:rollup2
AND FOR THAT WE THINK THERE

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:05.288 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:05.721 region:rollup2

WITNESS AND ALTER HAVE STATED

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:22.705 region:rollup2
MANY REASONS FOR THIS IT ALSO

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.307 region:rollup2
LIMITS THE ABILITY FOR

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:26.742 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:28.711 region:rollup2
FIREARMS. TO THE CITIZENS HERE

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:31.113 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR CITIZENS

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:32.615 region:rollup2
TO OBTAIN THE FIREARMS OF THE

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:34.050 region:rollup2
MICRO STAMPING IS EASILY

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:36.118 region:rollup2
DEFEATED EITHER JUST DUE TO

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.820 region:rollup2
NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. ON THE END

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:39.422 region:rollup2
OF A FIRING PIN WHICH IS LIKE

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.457 region:rollup2
THE DIAMETER OF A PIECE OF THE

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:43.593 region:rollup2
PENCIL LEAD. THAT IT CAN ALSO BE

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:44.860 region:rollup2
INTENSELY REMOVED VERY EASILY

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:46.696 region:rollup2
WITH ABRASIVE SUCH AS EMERY

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:49.165 region:rollup2
CLOTH OR FILE OR A FINGERNAIL

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:52.168 region:rollup2
FILE. YOU'D ALSO SEED A CRIME

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:53.402 region:rollup2
SCENE WITH OBTAINING MICRO

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:55.471 region:rollup2
STAMPED. BRASS.

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:58.774 region:rollup2
LEAVING IT THERE TO BELIEVE SOME

01:12:55.471 --> 01:13:01.210 region:rollup2
TYPE OF. OF REASONABLE DOUBT OF

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:02.979 region:rollup2
WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME AND SO

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.547 region:rollup2
FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.948 region:rollup2
IF THEY WANTED TO COMMIT A

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:08.184 region:rollup2
CRIME THEY COULD USE A REVOLVER

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:09.619 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES NOT. EL EXPEL THE

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:11.220 region:rollup2
BRASS INTO A CRIME SCENE BUT

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:12.955 region:rollup2
STILL STAYS WITHIN THE CYLINDER

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.522 region:rollup2
SO FOR THESE REASONS AYE

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.423 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING AYE VOTE ON THIS

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.925 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:17.660 region:rollup2
I THINK MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:18.361 region:rollup2
GIVEN LIMITED TIME I WANNA PUT

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.429 region:rollup2
OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:21.864 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES HAVE NOT REJECTED

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:23.1000 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THEM. THEY SAY THAT

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:25.434 region:rollup2
IF THEY DO USE IT BECAUSE OF THE

01:13:23.1000 --> 01:13:26.836 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTIES AND THE PROBLEMS

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:28.337 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THEY COULD BE SUED OUT

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:30.273 region:rollup2
OF EXISTENCE IF THEY MAKE ONE

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.806 region:rollup2
MISTAKE. IMPAIRING HIM A A

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:33.142 region:rollup2
FIRING PIN TO A PARTICULAR

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:35.177 region:rollup2
FRAME.

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:36.812 region:rollup2
IF.

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:38.247 region:rollup2
IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IN

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:40.316 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS IN

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.617 region:rollup2
CUSTOMIZING PROCESS THOSE THINGS

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:43.286 region:rollup2
GET MESSED UP THEY'RE GOING TO

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:45.621 region:rollup2
BE SUED OUT OF EXISTENCE.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:47.423 region:rollup2
NO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:50.092 region:rollup2
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.761 region:rollup2
BY THE GUNS THAT DON'T HAVE THIS

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.362 region:rollup2
THAT ALL THE CITIZENS DON'T.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:55.064 region:rollup2
CANNOT GET BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:56.332 region:rollup2
ON THE APPROVED LIST BECAUSE OF

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.934 region:rollup2
MICRO STAMPING.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:59.702 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE SAFER MORE

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:01.537 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT MORE COST EFFECTIVE.

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:02.371 region:rollup2
CITIZENS SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.240 region:rollup2
SAME.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:06.042 region:rollup2
.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.511 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE OR RIGHT MICHAEL

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:10.713 region:rollup2
STAMPING IS ONE TWENTY SIX THAT

01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:11.647 region:rollup2
THICKNESS OF A HAIR. THAT'S WHAT

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:13.182 region:rollup2
THE IMPRESSION IS ON THE FIRING

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:15.084 region:rollup2
PIN.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:16.452 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE REMOVED VERY EASILY IT

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:18.788 region:rollup2
REMOVES ITSELF.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:20.556 region:rollup2
WITH CONTINUED USE.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.358 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT'S IT'S IT'S GONE BUT

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:25.094 region:rollup2
THAT HAS PREVENTED.

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:27.296 region:rollup2
SAFE. INEXPENSIVE.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:28.898 region:rollup2
OUR MODERN FIREARMS FROM BEING

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.066 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BE SOLD THEY STILL HAVE

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:31.767 region:rollup2
THAT LOADED CHAMBER INDICATORS

01:14:30.066 --> 01:14:32.702 region:rollup2
MAGAZINE DISCONNECT THEY HAVE TO

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:34.403 region:rollup2
BE DROPPED THAT SIX FEET ON

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:37.039 region:rollup2
CONCRETE THEY CAN ACCIDENTALLY

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:39.342 region:rollup2
GO OFF. THEIR VERY SAFE GUNS AND

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:40.810 region:rollup2
THIS PROVISION THAT REQUIRES A

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:43.412 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT NOBODY.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:45.014 region:rollup2
IN THOUGH WORLD USES.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:47.316 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER OF FACT NO

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:49.785 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE HAS PURCHASED THE

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.920 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR MACHINERY THAT IT

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.420 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.055 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS CAPABILITY AND

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.957 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:56.525 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:59.762 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW THIS LAW BECAUSE YOU

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:00.296 region:rollup2
CANNOT. IMPRESS THAT.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:01.697 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU COULD TO IT

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:03.199 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY YOU CANNOT

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.867 region:rollup2
IMPRESSIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT

LOCATIONS ON A CASE.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.703 region:rollup2
IT CANNOT BE DONE.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:11.540 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:14.477 region:rollup2
LIZOTTE ABANDONED HIS PATENT

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.111 region:rollup2
WHICH MADE IT AVAILABLE FOR FOR

THANK YOU.

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:04.927 region:rollup2

THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:08.064 region:rollup2
BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT COME

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:10.232 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE TODDLERS ARE ACTUALLY

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:12.001 region:rollup2
ABANDON THE PATENT BECAUSE HE

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:13.335 region:rollup2
SAW THE PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:15.771 region:rollup2
AND HE WANTED TO BE IN THE

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:17.173 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DOMAIN. HE WAS NOT

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:18.307 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN MAKING MONEY TO.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.875 region:rollup2
MONEY OFF OF THIS

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:22.244 region:rollup2
IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET THE

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:23.979 region:rollup2
PATENTS UNENCUMBERED BECAUSE I'M

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.915 region:rollup2
THE NOTES TO HIM THE GUN LOBBY

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:27.817 region:rollup2
RENEW THE PATENT.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.318 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE HISTORY ON THAT

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:30.986 region:rollup2
ALLOW THESE ARGUMENTS I HEARD

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:32.221 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FIRST PASSED THE BILL IS

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:34.290 region:rollup2
A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:35.925 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS. IN TWO

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.959 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN'S WHEN IT WAS

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:39.595 region:rollup2
ENACTED.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:41.897 region:rollup2
AT THAT TIME WE MADE THE POINT

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:43.866 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF. GUN CRIME

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:46.035 region:rollup2
TWO WORDS ON SOFT PARTICULARLY

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:47.670 region:rollup2
AFTER DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS WHERE

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:49.672 region:rollup2
THE ONLY EVIDENCE LEFT ARE WHERE

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:51.240 region:rollup2
THE BULLET CASINGS THE CARTRIDGE

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:52.775 region:rollup2
CASINGS LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.110 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA IS TO HAVE

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:57.146 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL MARKS THAT WILL LINK

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.914 region:rollup2
THOSE CASINGS ARE TO THE GUN

01:16:57.146 --> 01:17:02.818 region:rollup2
WHERE THEN THE. THE RANDOM.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:03.452 region:rollup2
BALLISTIC EVIDENCE THAT WOULD

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:05.254 region:rollup2
BE THERE OTHERWISE.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:07.189 region:rollup2
AND THAT NEED OF COURSE TO SOFT

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:08.257 region:rollup2
ON CRIME IS STILL THERE.

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:11.460 region:rollup2
ARMY MY ITEM WHEN.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:13.729 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATION WAS PASSED TO

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.598 region:rollup2
REQUIRE NEW HANDGUNS NEW MODELS

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:17.833 region:rollup2
OF HANDGUNS TO HAVE CHAMBER LOAD

01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:19.068 region:rollup2
INDICATORS A MAGAZINE DISCONNECT

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.703 region:rollup2
AND THE GUN DESERVES INDUSTRY

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:22.771 region:rollup2
SAID WE CANNOT DO IT. AND WE

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:24.540 region:rollup2
WILL NOT DO IT AND THEY DIDN'T

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:26.642 region:rollup2
FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEN

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:28.777 region:rollup2
FINALLY ONE MANUFACTURE DECIDED

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.612 region:rollup2
TO AND THEN WE SAW THOSE KIND

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.114 region:rollup2
GUNS COME ONLINE.

01:17:29.612 --> 01:17:34.216 region:rollup2
I SUSPECT THIS WILL BE THE SAME

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:36.318 region:rollup2

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:50.092 region:rollup2
REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA AND OF

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.361 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES ONE THOUSAND FIFTY

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.762 region:rollup2
ONE. WERE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:57.032 region:rollup2
IN SOME COUNTIES THE CRIME IS

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:58.333 region:rollup2
GROWING AT A NEAR EPIDEMIC RATE.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:59.501 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH OF THESE NUMBERS HAS

01:23:58.333 --> 01:24:01.169 region:rollup2
PERHAPS BEEN AIDED BY OUR

01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.638 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CODES COUNTERINTUITIVE

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:04.439 region:rollup2
TREATMENT OF THIS DEVASTATING

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:05.507 region:rollup2
CRIME.

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:06.909 region:rollup2
HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING IS AN

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:08.543 region:rollup2
OFFENSE WITH VIOLENCE AT ITS

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:10.445 region:rollup2
CORE YET IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:11.547 region:rollup2
SERIOUS OR VIOLENT CRIME UNDER

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.681 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.782 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT MANY SEX

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:15.050 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKERS COULD BE RELEASED

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:16.518 region:rollup2
FROM PRISON AFTER SERVING ONLY

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.920 region:rollup2
HALF THEIR SENTENCE

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.288 region:rollup2
IT ALSO MEANS THE RELEASED AFTER

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.223 region:rollup2
ONLY SERVING A SENTENCE FOR ONE

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:22.858 region:rollup2
VICTIM. REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:24.359 region:rollup2
VICTIMS THERE WERE CONVICTED OF

01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:26.361 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:27.829 region:rollup2
AB TWO THREE FIVE SIX WOULD FIX

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:29.998 region:rollup2
THIS ANOMALY WOULD SIMPLY ADD A

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:31.366 region:rollup2
SEX TRAFFICKING TO THE LIST OF

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:32.768 region:rollup2

TRAFFICKING WITH.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:03.365 region:rollup2
SEX CASES INVOLVING HUMAN

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:04.800 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING IS ON OUR STATE

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:06.935 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN WONDERFUL NEW LAWS

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.736 region:rollup2
ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:10.272 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:12.074 region:rollup2
VICTIMS. BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:12.841 region:rollup2
THE SIX THE SOLUTION AND IF WE

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.544 region:rollup2
DON'T.

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:16.878 region:rollup2
START TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:18.714 region:rollup2
CAN IT KEEP THE ACTUAL

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:20.749 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKERS TO DO THEIR TIME

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:22.918 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY SENTENCED

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:24.052 region:rollup2
TO. THIS CYCLE OF VIOLENCE WILL

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:25.988 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WITH THESE TRAFFICKERS

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:28.790 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE VICTIMS ARE NOT

01:25:25.988 --> 01:25:30.292 region:rollup2
HAVING TIME TO.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.393 region:rollup2
GET LIFE SKILLS THEY'RE NOT

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:34.363 region:rollup2
HAVING THEIR STILL BEING

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:35.764 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED BY THE TRAFFICKERS IN

01:25:34.363 --> 01:25:37.766 region:rollup2
PRINT IN PRISON IN JAIL WHERE

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:39.101 region:rollup2
THEY ARE EVERY CASE THAT I SEE

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:40.969 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:42.938 region:rollup2
REACHING OUT. SO THESE VICTIMS

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:45.440 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE FAITH IN OUR SYSTEM

01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:46.475 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO COOPERATE

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.144 region:rollup2
AT INITIALLY.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:51.546 region:rollup2
SOME NOT ALL THEY'RE HAVING

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.948 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT TIMES BELIEVING

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:54.216 region:rollup2
IN THE FAITH THAT THIS PERSON IS

01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:55.617 region:rollup2
REALLY GOING TO BE LIKE THAT LET

01:25:54.216 --> 01:25:58.020 region:rollup2
ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. IF A

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:59.721 region:rollup2
PERSON WHO IS CONVICTED OF SEX

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.324 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING IS SENTENCED TO

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:03.825 region:rollup2

THERE OUT IN FOUR YEARS.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.895 region:rollup2
VICTIMS NO THAT'S THE MARCY'S

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:08.797 region:rollup2
LAUNCHERS THAT ALL VICTIMS ARE

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.598 region:rollup2
TOLD AND GIVEN THIS INFORMATION

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:11.233 region:rollup2
UPON.

01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:13.168 region:rollup2
A DISPOSITION OR A GUILTY

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:14.636 region:rollup2
CONVICTION.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.104 region:rollup2
NOW YOU TAKE THAT SAME PERSON

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:17.205 region:rollup2
AND NOW YOU HAVE THREE VICTIMS

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:18.740 region:rollup2
FOR FIVE IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.841 region:rollup2
IF IF

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.376 region:rollup2
THREE VICTIM CASE.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.811 region:rollup2
.

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.446 region:rollup2
THAT TAKEN THAT'S BLOW TERM OF

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.714 region:rollup2
EIGHT YEARS AND YOU ADD THOSE

01:26:24.446 --> 01:26:26.548 region:rollup2
OTHER TWO VICTIMS ON THAT BE

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.949 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS AND FOUR

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:30.218 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:31.486 region:rollup2
THAT TRAFFICKER IS STILL

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:33.855 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR.

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:35.090 region:rollup2
RELEASE AFTER FOUR YEARS

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:36.858 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE THE FACTS THAT WE

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:39.361 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TELL.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:40.729 region:rollup2
VICTIMS AND TRYINGTO CONVINCE

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.998 region:rollup2
THEM TO COOPERATE WITH POLICE

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:45.567 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DAUNTING SITUATION AND

01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:47.536 region:rollup2
THEY ARE CONSTANTLY IN FEAR FOR

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:49.337 region:rollup2
THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SAFETY AND

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:50.806 region:rollup2
NOT WANTING TO COME FORWARD.

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:52.340 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS A VIOLENT FELONY THAT

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:55.077 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT IT MAKES THEM BE

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.077 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:58.113 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR SENTENCE

01:26:56.278 --> 01:26:59.948 region:rollup2
AND SET A FIFTY PERCENT ANOTHER

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:01.917 region:rollup2
KEY VALUABLE POINT THAT MAKING

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:02.417 region:rollup2
THIS A VIOLENT FELONY CHANGES.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:05.187 region:rollup2
AS.

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:06.788 region:rollup2
AS A GENERAL RULE PROSECUTORS

01:27:05.187 --> 01:27:08.256 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IF THEY'RE

01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:10.525 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO PROCEED AT THE END OF.

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:12.260 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO TO TRIAL

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:14.529 region:rollup2
WITHIN STATUTORY TIMELINES ON A

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.098 region:rollup2
FELONY. THEY GET TWO CHANCES

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:17.933 region:rollup2
THEY CAN I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:19.668 region:rollup2
TO REFILE UNDER CURRENT LAW. A

01:27:17.933 --> 01:27:21.002 region:rollup2
VIOLENT FELONY HOWEVER YOU HAVE

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:22.871 region:rollup2
A THIRD CHANCE.

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:24.973 region:rollup2
AS A PROSECUTOR IF THEY'RE

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:26.241 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO PROCEED THESE. HOW

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:27.876 region:rollup2
MANY HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:29.845 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY INVOLVING SEX

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:32.247 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKED VICTIMS ARE VERY

01:27:29.845 --> 01:27:32.881 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO FIND ARE VICTIMS

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.415 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FROM OUT NAY OF THEM ARE

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:35.617 region:rollup2
HOMELESS THEY'RE HAVING IN

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:37.519 region:rollup2
SHELTERS? TAKES A LOT OF TIME

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:38.854 region:rollup2
MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS TO GAIN

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:40.122 region:rollup2
THE TRUST OF THAT THEY SHARE

01:27:38.854 --> 01:27:41.556 region:rollup2
WITH US THAT THEY TELL US WHAT'S

01:27:40.122 --> 01:27:43.592 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. AND THESE TIME

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:45.494 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE GOOD TIME

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:47.295 region:rollup2
RESTRAINTS FOR STATUTORY REASONS

01:27:45.494 --> 01:27:48.797 region:rollup2
FOR TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:50.465 region:rollup2
ACCUSED BUT TO ALLOW US THAT

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:51.833 region:rollup2
THIRD CHANCE FOR MAKING THIS A

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:53.835 region:rollup2
VIOLENT FELONY WOULD BE VERY

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:56.738 region:rollup2
CRITICAL. IN THE OVERALL

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:57.405 region:rollup2

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:17.919 region:rollup2
BEHIND WHAT WE ARE SAYING I

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:19.221 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NOW

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:21.056 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AS

01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:22.290 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY AS A SOCIETY TO HEAR

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:24.125 region:rollup2
FROM TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:26.027 region:rollup2
HEAR THEIR EXPERIENCES. IT'S

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:27.229 region:rollup2
FAIR AND JUST TO SAY THAT IT IS

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.997 region:rollup2
A CRIME OF VIOLENCE THEY

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.966 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE A LOT OF VIOLENCE

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:33.134 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEMSELVES. AND SO IT'S

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:34.603 region:rollup2
FAIR JUST TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:37.038 region:rollup2
CALL IT WHAT IT IS WHEN WE START

01:29:34.603 --> 01:29:38.740 region:rollup2
CALLING A CRIME AND PUTTING THAT

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:40.008 region:rollup2
TITLE TO IT THAT IT DESERVES. I

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.776 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN CHANGE CAN

01:29:40.008 --> 01:29:43.345 region:rollup2
BE MADE SO I FIRST JUST SAYING

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:45.180 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS AND THAT WILL SPEAK

01:29:43.345 --> 01:29:46.514 region:rollup2
VOLUMES HE'LL SPEAK VOLUMES TO

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.048 region:rollup2
ALL PARTIES INVOLVED THE

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:48.416 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKER AS WELL AS THE

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:50.819 region:rollup2
VICTIM.

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:52.053 region:rollup2
IT HELPS TO CONFIRM TO THEM YES

01:29:50.819 --> 01:29:53.288 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT YOU'R A VICTIM THIS

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:55.257 region:rollup2
IS UNFAIR AND WE ARE GOING TO

01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:56.391 region:rollup2
SUPPORT YOU. I RECENTLY

01:29:55.257 --> 01:29:58.193 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED A CLIENT THROUGH THE

01:29:56.391 --> 01:30:00.662 region:rollup2
COURT PROCESS OF PROSECUTION OF

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:02.130 region:rollup2
HER TRAFFICKER AND BY ALL

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:03.999 region:rollup2
PARTIES INVOLVED SHE WAS VERY A

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:05.433 region:rollup2
COOPERATIVE SHE WANTED TO WORK

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:06.968 region:rollup2
WITH THE DA SHE WANTED TO WORK

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:08.336 region:rollup2
WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:09.971 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT HER TRAFFICKER

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:11.907 region:rollup2
WAS PUT INTO JAIL.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:13.008 region:rollup2
AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:14.776 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD TO DEAL WITH

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:16.311 region:rollup2
HER OWN TRAUMA IN TRYING TO GT

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:18.346 region:rollup2
SAFE AND THINK ABOUT HER OWN

01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:20.048 region:rollup2
SAFETY NOT ONLY IN THE MOMENT

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:23.051 region:rollup2
THAT HER WELL BEING A LONG TERM

01:30:20.048 --> 01:30:23.485 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD BUILDING THE LIFE

01:30:23.051 --> 01:30:24.085 region:rollup2
THAT SHE DESERVED.

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:25.587 region:rollup2
FROM THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.988 region:rollup2
ARRESTED EVEN AFTER HE WAS

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.822 region:rollup2
SENTENCED AND TRANSFERRED TO

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.557 region:rollup2
WHERE HE WAS GOING TO BE

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:31.126 region:rollup2
SPENDING HIS TIME HE CONTINUE TO

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
REACH OUT TO HER TO THREATEN TO

01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:34.162 region:rollup2
HURT TO THREATEN HER FAMILY

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:36.398 region:rollup2
MEMBERS. TO CONTACT HER ON

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:38.500 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA AND SO ALL THAT

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:40.135 region:rollup2
THAT DID WAS NOT ONLY CONFIRMED

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.037 region:rollup2
HER THE FEARS THAT SHE HAD WERE

01:30:40.135 --> 01:30:44.139 region:rollup2
ALIVE AND VALID BUT IT ALSO

01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:46.341 region:rollup2
CHANGED HER TIMELINE SHE KNEW.

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:48.009 region:rollup2
THAT HE WAS IN CONTROL STILL

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:49.411 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS LOCKED UP AND

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:51.313 region:rollup2
NOT VERY SOON BECAUSE THE PLEA

01:30:49.411 --> 01:30:51.913 region:rollup2
THAT HE DID ACCEPT THAT HE WOULD

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:54.049 region:rollup2
BE GETTING THAT HE WOULD BE

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:55.984 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT. SO I THINK THAT IF

01:30:54.049 --> 01:30:57.585 region:rollup2
AS A COMMUNITY WE THINK IT'S

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:58.787 region:rollup2
HARD TO HEAR THE STORIES AND

01:30:57.585 --> 01:31:00.755 region:rollup2
IT'S CHALLENGING TO COME UP WITH

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:02.157 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS. TO TRY TO HELP THESE

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:03.558 region:rollup2
VICTIMS THAT WE CAN TAKE A

01:31:02.157 --> 01:31:04.793 region:rollup2
MINUTE JUST TO THINK HOW MUCH

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:06.528 region:rollup2
HARDER IS THAT FOR THE VICTIMS

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:07.996 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE

01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:09.931 region:rollup2
STORIES AND THESE EXPERIENCES TO

01:31:07.996 --> 01:31:12.867 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD AND THAT IF WHAT WE

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:13.435 region:rollup2
CAN GIVE THEM. IS MORE TIME THAN

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:16.504 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IS VERY FAIR.

01:31:13.435 --> 01:31:18.373 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:19.741 region:rollup2

THREE FIFTY SIX.

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:46.735 region:rollup2
BY ADDING NEWMAN SEX TRAFFICKING

01:31:45.367 --> 01:31:48.370 region:rollup2
TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT FELONIES

01:31:46.735 --> 01:31:49.671 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX WOULD

01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:52.073 region:rollup2
PERPETUATE CALIFORNIA'S

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:54.075 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE AND INEFFECTIVE OVER

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:55.677 region:rollup2
RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION. IN

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:57.512 region:rollup2
DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO WHAT THE

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:58.680 region:rollup2
VOTERS INTENDED WHEN THEY VOTED

01:31:57.512 --> 01:32:00.448 region:rollup2
FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.183 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY SIX ALSO

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:03.284 region:rollup2
SINGLES OUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:05.587 region:rollup2
A CRIME FOR WHICH INCREASED

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:06.187 region:rollup2
PENALTIES UP TO FIFTEEN TO LIFE

01:32:05.587 --> 01:32:07.989 region:rollup2
HAVE JUST RECENTLY GONE INTO

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:09.090 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.792 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD MAKE SEX

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:12.026 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING A STRIKE EXPANDING

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:13.661 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THAT LAW TO FURTHER

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:14.996 region:rollup2
SET BACK THE CLOCK AND KEEP MORE

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:16.531 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BEHIND BARS FOR FAR

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:17.632 region:rollup2
LONGER.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:19.501 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT FIXES A

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:21.202 region:rollup2
MISTAKE THE OPPONENTS OF PROP

01:32:19.501 --> 01:32:22.704 region:rollup2
FIFTY SEVEN EXPRESSLY POINTED TO

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.506 region:rollup2
HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING AMONG

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:25.874 region:rollup2
OTHER CRIMES. IN ARGUING AGAINST

01:32:24.506 --> 01:32:27.042 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSITION.

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:28.376 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS DIDN'T BUY IT BECAUSE

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:29.477 region:rollup2
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHOICE

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.779 region:rollup2
THEY WERE MAKING WAS WHAT WAS

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:32.347 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON

01:32:30.779 --> 01:32:34.149 region:rollup2
PRISON COSTS.

01:32:32.347 --> 01:32:35.817 region:rollup2
THERE ARE WAYS TO COMBAT HUMAN

01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:37.419 region:rollup2
SEX TRAFFICKING WE DON'T DO NOT

01:32:35.817 --> 01:32:40.221 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:41.923 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME SERVED FOR IT. AS

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.525 region:rollup2
WOULD HAPPEN UNDER THIS BILL IS

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:45.026 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO DO THAT.

01:32:43.525 --> 01:32:46.094 region:rollup2
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRISONERS

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:48.196 region:rollup2
AND THE COST OF INCARCERATING

01:32:46.094 --> 01:32:50.065 region:rollup2
THEM IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF

01:32:48.196 --> 01:32:51.866 region:rollup2
CRIME BY CRIME THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:53.134 region:rollup2
RECLASSIFIED OFFENSES SO AS TO

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:56.037 region:rollup2

SO I WILL BE VOTING FOR YOUR

01:33:10.652 --> 01:33:18.126 region:rollup2

BRINGING THIS BILL TO OUR

ATTENTION AS WELL AS THE

01:33:34.676 --> 01:33:37.812 region:rollup2
WITNESSES TODAY.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:39.547 region:rollup2
I THINK FOR A LOT OF THOSE THREE

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:41.583 region:rollup2
STRIKES ARE PROBLEMATIC

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:43.585 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN HOWELL.

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:44.052 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPACTED PRIMARILY

01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:45.987 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:48.456 region:rollup2
.

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:50.124 region:rollup2
BLACK MEN LATINO MEN ARE.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:51.159 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED AT DIFFERENT RATES

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:52.460 region:rollup2
ACROSS OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR

01:33:51.159 --> 01:33:55.230 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:56.397 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT IT BOTHERS ME THAT

01:33:55.230 --> 01:33:57.999 region:rollup2
CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:59.334 region:rollup2
AGAINST WOMEN WHICH ARE WOMEN

01:33:57.999 --> 01:34:01.669 region:rollup2
ARE PREDOMINANTLY THE THE

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:03.404 region:rollup2
VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. ARE

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:05.206 region:rollup2
NOT SEEN AS VIOLENT.

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:06.975 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT.

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:08.543 region:rollup2
THESE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED OVER

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:10.478 region:rollup2
AND OVER AND OVER TO A PERSON'S

01:34:08.543 --> 01:34:13.681 region:rollup2
BODY.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:15.016 region:rollup2
I THINK SAYS A LOT ABOUT.

01:34:13.681 --> 01:34:16.784 region:rollup2
HOW WE MANAGE OUR OUR

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:19.187 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:20.555 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TO BE VIOLENT CRIMES?

01:34:19.187 --> 01:34:21.623 region:rollup2
AND FOR HOPE. TO.

01:34:20.555 --> 01:34:23.424 region:rollup2
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:25.393 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WHILE.

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:28.363 region:rollup2
SEX TRAFFICKING OCCURS TO MOSTLY

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:30.098 region:rollup2
WOMEN. IT ALSO OCCURS TO MEN.

01:34:28.363 --> 01:34:31.933 region:rollup2
AND THE BEAT GOES BEYOND GENDER.

01:34:30.098 --> 01:34:33.701 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES BEYOND AGE

01:34:31.933 --> 01:34:35.069 region:rollup2
SINCE WE KNOW A LOT OF VICTIMS

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:37.238 region:rollup2
ARE UNDER AGE AS WELL.

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:39.107 region:rollup2
SO WHILE I DO HAVE SOME

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:40.542 region:rollup2
RESERVATIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:34:39.107 --> 01:34:41.843 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS I THINK.

01:34:40.542 --> 01:34:43.478 region:rollup2
I WILL BE VOTING YES BECAUSE I

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:44.579 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT CRIMES COMMITTED

01:34:43.478 --> 01:34:45.613 region:rollup2
AGAINST WOMEN PREDOMINANTLY

01:34:44.579 --> 01:34:46.281 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:48.283 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE SEX.

01:34:46.281 --> 01:34:49.918 region:rollup2
I.

01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:51.519 region:rollup2
THE TRAFFICKING SO VERY SERIOUS

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:07.428 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT IN THAT

01:46:04.992 --> 01:46:08.762 region:rollup2
CASE WHERE SOMEBODY WHICH WE

01:46:07.428 --> 01:46:10.631 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE BUT

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:11.832 region:rollup2
WERE SOME HE DOES COME BACK INTO

01:46:10.631 --> 01:46:13.968 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM?

01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:18.739 region:rollup2
HOW MANY TIMES ARE THEY

01:46:13.968 --> 01:46:21.008 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE FOR ON THIS RELIEF WHAT

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:23.277 region:rollup2
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE WE WE

01:46:21.008 --> 01:46:24.645 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:23.277 --> 01:46:25.846 region:rollup2
BOTH THE COURT'S PERMISSION IN

01:46:24.645 --> 01:46:27.348 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:46:25.846 --> 01:46:29.617 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:31.619 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE

01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:34.188 region:rollup2
NEED TO BEST SERVE THEM?

01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:38.592 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY COME BACK IF THEY DO

01:46:34.188 --> 01:46:41.528 region:rollup2
COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:42.229 region:rollup2
SO THERE CERTAINLY FISCAL COSTS

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:45.366 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:46.433 region:rollup2
FOR PERMISSION WE STILL BELIEVE

01:46:45.366 --> 01:46:49.970 region:rollup2
THERE'S A.

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:52.740 region:rollup2
A VERY STRONG NEED FOR THE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:56.543 region:rollup2
COURT TO HAVE A ROLE IN THIS.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:59.747 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROCESS AND IN LOOKING

01:46:56.543 --> 01:47:00.781 region:rollup2
AT THESE PETITIONS SO I'M WERE

01:46:59.747 --> 01:47:01.382 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:09.523 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON

01:47:01.382 --> 01:47:10.457 region:rollup2
HALF THE

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:12.559 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:13.127 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:13.927 region:rollup2
OPPOSE AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY

01:47:13.127 --> 01:47:15.262 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:18.399 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW PRESENTLY HOW THE

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:19.800 region:rollup2
PROCESS BY WHICH A PERSON CAN

01:47:18.399 --> 01:47:20.868 region:rollup2
WITH MINIMAL EFFORT OBTAIN THIS

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.635 region:rollup2
RELIEF.

01:47:20.868 --> 01:47:22.403 region:rollup2
AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:23.337 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:47:22.403 --> 01:47:25.139 region:rollup2
PROSECUTING AGENCY TO CHALLENGE

01:47:23.337 --> 01:47:26.907 region:rollup2
THE RELIEF. IF THEY BELIEVE THE

01:47:25.139 --> 01:47:27.675 region:rollup2
PERSON DOES NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE

01:47:26.907 --> 01:47:29.043 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF

01:47:27.675 --> 01:47:31.211 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OFFENSE

01:47:29.043 --> 01:47:32.646 region:rollup2
OR FACING CURRENT CHARGES.

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:35.049 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE CHANGES RESULT IN

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:36.417 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COSTS AND WORKLOAD

01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:38.385 region:rollup2
FOR A TRIAL COURT'S LIKELY AT

01:47:36.417 --> 01:47:40.154 region:rollup2
THE EXPENSE OF THEIR CURRENT

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:42.356 region:rollup2
TASKS IN OBLIGATIONS. WHICH TEND

01:47:40.154 --> 01:47:42.923 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED

01:47:42.356 --> 01:47:43.891 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN CLEANING UP OLD

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:45.893 region:rollup2
RECORDS.

01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:47.594 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THE EXISTING PROCESS

01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:50.164 region:rollup2
OFFICIALLY BALANCES A PERSON'S

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:51.665 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK RELIEF.

01:47:50.164 --> 01:47:52.933 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROSECUTION'S

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:54.635 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:56.370 region:rollup2
ONLY QUALIFYING OFFENDERS ARE

01:47:54.635 --> 01:47:58.272 region:rollup2
ABLE TO BENEFIT.

01:47:56.370 --> 01:47:59.540 region:rollup2
WE'RE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHIN

01:47:58.272 --> 01:48:01.075 region:rollup2
EXISTING RESOURCES AND SEE NO

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:06.213 region:rollup2
REASON WHY THE PROCESS NEEDS TO

01:48:01.075 --> 01:48:07.581 region:rollup2
BE CHANGED.

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:08.549 region:rollup2
SHARON RILEY.

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.550 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:48:08.549 --> 01:48:10.818 region:rollup2
VERY BRIEFLY WE ARE OPPOSED TO

01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:12.052 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:13.153 region:rollup2
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:14.722 region:rollup2
AUTHOR'S.

01:48:13.153 --> 01:48:16.423 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS.

01:48:14.722 --> 01:48:17.725 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:19.760 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL.

01:48:17.725 --> 01:48:22.730 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE COURTS

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.932 region:rollup2
WILL GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:27.234 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO VERIFY THAT THE

01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:29.770 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:31.438 region:rollup2
EXPUNGEMENT AND FOR EXAMPLE ONE

01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:34.875 region:rollup2
OF THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:36.110 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DETERMINING WHETHER AN

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:37.411 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL HUSTLER LIVED IN

01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:41.248 region:rollup2
HONEST AND UPRIGHT LIFE.

ACCESS TO THE.

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:45.753 region:rollup2
THE RAP SHEETS AND THEY WOULD

01:48:44.685 --> 01:48:50.324 region:rollup2
ORDINARILY GET THAT INFORMATION

01:48:45.753 --> 01:48:51.492 region:rollup2
FROM THE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS

01:48:50.324 --> 01:48:53.060 region:rollup2
SO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:48:51.492 --> 01:48:54.161 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WORKING WITH AUTHOR

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:55.629 region:rollup2

FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:49:08.175 --> 01:49:17.384 region:rollup2

BAG MORNING THAT MISTER TING AND

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:23.223 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S A.

01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:27.928 region:rollup2
A LOT BEHIND THIS THAT I I CAN.

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:30.197 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE AND I I

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:31.365 region:rollup2
WILL NOTE THE SORT OF DIE IN

01:49:30.197 --> 01:49:34.701 region:rollup2
INCONGRUITY THAT.

01:49:31.365 --> 01:49:36.570 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL NOT A FACT I THE

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:39.306 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATION OF SOMEONE.

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:42.176 region:rollup2
WHO HAS A CONVICTION FOR AN

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:44.511 region:rollup2
OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE THAT IS?

01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:46.013 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:48.415 region:rollup2
GIVEN BY.

01:49:46.013 --> 01:49:49.483 region:rollup2

AGENCIES.

01:49:49.483 --> 01:49:54.354 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT US SUCH PEOPLE WILL

01:49:52.186 --> 01:49:56.356 region:rollup2
STILL NOT BE AYE QUALIFIED EVEN

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:57.458 region:rollup2
GET A LICENSE IN MANY CASES.

01:49:56.356 --> 01:49:59.827 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S SOME.

01:49:57.458 --> 01:50:00.994 region:rollup2
INCONGRUITY. IN THAT THE VERY

01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:01.462 region:rollup2
THING THE IDEA THAT IS A

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:03.063 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CONVICTION.

01:50:01.462 --> 01:50:04.331 region:rollup2
THAT DISQUALIFIES YOU.

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.799 region:rollup2

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:09.336 region:rollup2
CONCEAL FROM EVEN BEING A FACTOR

01:50:08.469 --> 01:50:11.672 region:rollup2
IN THE DECISION A PRIVATE

01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:12.639 region:rollup2

MEASURE TO.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.211 region:rollup2

ABOUT.

01:50:28.689 --> 01:50:30.757 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S BAD AND WE NEED

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:30.958 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DEAL WITH

01:50:30.757 --> 01:50:32.493 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:34.261 region:rollup2
AND I COULD CERTAINLY.

01:50:32.493 --> 01:50:35.696 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. THE MAGIC SUPPORTING

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:42.636 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION SIMPLY I MAKING THE

THINK IS IS IN THE INTERESTS OF

01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:46.907 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND IT'S NOT

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:48.942 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT. I THINK IS

01:50:46.907 --> 01:50:49.843 region:rollup2
REALLY WORKABLE.

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:54.748 region:rollup2
BUT I APPRECIATE THAT INTENDS

01:50:49.843 --> 01:50:57.251 region:rollup2

FOLKS THAT WERE ON PROBATION

01:51:11.131 --> 01:51:14.768 region:rollup2
AFTER NINETEEN SEVENTY WILL

DISCUSSIONS WITH PROBATION

01:51:23.477 --> 01:51:25.646 region:rollup2

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:13.260 region:rollup2
I HAVE VOTED IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:15.262 region:rollup2

FOUND OUT ON THE WERE CERTAIN

01:52:15.262 --> 01:52:18.732 region:rollup2
CRIMES ON THEIR THAT. I WOULDN'T

I CAN GET THAT LIST.

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:28.842 region:rollup2
I A I A.

01:52:26.173 --> 01:52:30.277 region:rollup2
INSISTS THAT ON THE ONE HAND

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:30.777 region:rollup2
FROM ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATIONS

01:52:30.277 --> 01:52:32.980 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT WHICH ARE NOT

01:52:30.777 --> 01:52:34.548 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING HERE THE THE REMOVAL

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:36.550 region:rollup2
OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY.

01:52:34.548 --> 01:52:38.085 region:rollup2
KIND OF ARBITRARY DATE IS A

01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:38.652 region:rollup2

STRUGGLE LITTLE INTERNALLY WITH

02:00:19.179 --> 02:00:25.085 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO WHO ON THEIR OWN.

02:00:23.049 --> 02:00:26.920 region:rollup2
WANTS TO CHANGE THEIR LIFE AND

02:00:25.085 --> 02:00:28.388 region:rollup2
TAKE SOME SORT OF INITIATIVE.

INTENT IS.

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:47.107 region:rollup2
ALSO STRUGGLE FROM TIME TO IT

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:47.807 region:rollup2

STEAL SOMETHING. AT A CERTAIN

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:59.285 region:rollup2
NUMBER NINE FIFTY IN OFFICE AND

I WOULDN'T WANT TO YOU THERE

02:00:59.886 --> 02:01:01.254 region:rollup2
SOME WHO ALLEGE THAT WE'VE

02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:02.489 region:rollup2
CREATED A SYSTEM NOW WHERE

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:03.189 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL GO TO THIS RIGHT

02:01:02.489 --> 02:01:05.558 region:rollup2
UNDER.

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:06.726 region:rollup2
AND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:08.394 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S NOW A

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:10.163 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR FREE PASS AYE ONE

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:12.232 region:rollup2
WANT TO CREATE THROUGH THIS. A

02:01:10.163 --> 02:01:12.766 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE SAY WHY GO

02:01:12.232 --> 02:01:13.766 region:rollup2
DO IT'S GONNA GET EXPLAINS

02:01:12.766 --> 02:01:15.168 region:rollup2
ANYWAYS.

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:17.003 region:rollup2

AND SO JUST TAKE THAT INTO

02:01:18.171 --> 02:01:21.141 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION I THINK AS WE MOVE

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:23.109 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:01:21.141 --> 02:01:23.810 region:rollup2
HOW TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:25.779 region:rollup2
FAIR FOR PEOPLE.

02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:27.313 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY.

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:28.581 region:rollup2
THAT REWARDS THE THE INCENTIVE

02:01:27.313 --> 02:01:29.883 region:rollup2
INSIDE OF A PERSON THAT SAYS HEY

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:31.885 region:rollup2

BILL TODAY.

02:02:07.187 --> 02:02:12.058 region:rollup2
MISTER CHANG IS. AN EXEMPLARY A

02:02:10.190 --> 02:02:13.827 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW

02:02:12.058 --> 02:02:14.394 region:rollup2
THAT HE WILL BE WORKING WITH

02:02:13.827 --> 02:02:16.462 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE IT IS

02:02:14.394 --> 02:02:19.199 region:rollup2
FAIR.

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:21.167 region:rollup2
I ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT IF YOU

02:02:19.199 --> 02:02:23.169 region:rollup2
HAVE MET THE PEOPLE. ARE UGLY

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:23.736 region:rollup2
WAS AFTER PROP FORTY SEVEN THERE

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:24.637 region:rollup2
WERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:26.005 region:rollup2
WHO.

02:02:24.637 --> 02:02:27.841 region:rollup2
.

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:29.008 region:rollup2
WERE SUDDENLY ELIGIBLE FOR

02:02:27.841 --> 02:02:31.444 region:rollup2
EXPUNGEMENT.

02:02:29.008 --> 02:02:33.947 region:rollup2
IT LETS A DIFFICULT PROCESS

02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:35.348 region:rollup2
AND OU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THAT

02:02:33.947 --> 02:02:36.549 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE

02:02:35.348 --> 02:02:38.585 region:rollup2
CRIMES TYPICALLY HAVE VERY

02:02:36.549 --> 02:02:40.653 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED LIVES.

02:02:38.585 --> 02:02:42.355 region:rollup2
AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:43.990 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AS THE PEOPLE IN THIS

02:02:42.355 --> 02:02:46.292 region:rollup2
ROOM HERE.

02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:48.228 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT.

02:02:46.292 --> 02:02:50.797 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN PAGE.

02:02:48.228 --> 02:02:53.233 region:rollup2
A PAPER IS VERY HARD TO DEAL

02:02:50.797 --> 02:02:55.268 region:rollup2
WITH OR THE FACT THAT ONE PERSON

02:02:53.233 --> 02:02:56.069 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT COURTS

02:02:55.268 --> 02:02:57.670 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:59.172 region:rollup2
EXPUNGEMENT STUDIO. AND THE.

02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:00.740 region:rollup2
.

02:02:59.172 --> 02:03:02.809 region:rollup2
THE RESULTS CAN DIFFER COURT TO

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.142 region:rollup2
COURT. I THINK THIS IS IN THE

02:03:02.809 --> 02:03:05.044 region:rollup2
CENTRAL BAIL.

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:07.513 region:rollup2
.

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:09.716 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:11.284 region:rollup2
IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE A

02:03:09.716 --> 02:03:12.785 region:rollup2
MISTAKE IN THE PAST TO BE ABLE

02:03:11.284 --> 02:03:14.621 region:rollup2
TO GO FORWARD.

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:16.189 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN'T GO FORWARD IN TO

02:03:14.621 --> 02:03:18.258 region:rollup2
WORK LEGALLY IF THEY'RE

02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:19.626 region:rollup2
PREVENTED FROM GETTING THAT WORK

02:03:18.258 --> 02:03:20.793 region:rollup2
BY HAVING SOMETHING ON THEIR

02:03:19.626 --> 02:03:23.763 region:rollup2
RECORD.

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:26.633 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IN TERMS OF MAKING

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:28.534 region:rollup2
THE BEST MOVE FORWARD.

02:03:26.633 --> 02:03:30.169 region:rollup2
HAVE A SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE CAN

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:32.138 region:rollup2
MAKE A LIVING.

02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:33.239 region:rollup2
FARM THINGS OTHER THAN CRIME

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:34.374 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:35.208 region:rollup2
FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:17:58.771 --> 02:18:02.274 region:rollup2
INCREASING PENALTIES BY FOUR TO

THE EFFECTS OF LONG SENTENCES.

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:10.616 region:rollup2
AND THE EFFECTS OF LONG

02:18:09.515 --> 02:18:12.618 region:rollup2

AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS.

02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:16.421 region:rollup2

OF HIV AND. HEPATITIS AN

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:19.892 region:rollup2

TO INCARCERATE FOLKS.

02:22:01.346 --> 02:22:05.717 region:rollup2

MORE IDENTIFIABLE.

02:29:29.761 --> 02:29:31.896 region:rollup2
NAME TO A DRUG AND I THINK WE

02:29:31.663 --> 02:29:33.097 region:rollup2

.

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:37.035 region:rollup2
VERY AWARE OF WHAT IT HAS DONE.

02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:38.937 region:rollup2
.

02:29:37.035 --> 02:29:40.705 region:rollup2
THE SACRAMENTO AREA WAS.

02:29:38.937 --> 02:29:41.105 region:rollup2

ANESTHETIC IT'S FIFTY TIMES MORE

02:29:48.713 --> 02:29:52.083 region:rollup2
POTENT THAN HEROIN.

A HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT THAN

MORPHINE.

02:29:54.052 --> 02:29:57.055 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE RAPID

02:29:55.353 --> 02:29:57.589 region:rollup2
SPREAD OF FENTON ALL IS THAT IT

02:29:57.055 --> 02:30:00.158 region:rollup2

02:29:57.589 --> 02:30:03.761 region:rollup2
MARGIN.

02:30:11.636 --> 02:30:15.139 region:rollup2
HERB SHED SOME OF THOSE PROFITS

02:30:13.438 --> 02:30:16.608 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE ENTICING

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:18.042 region:rollup2
AN INTERESTING TO DO THE DEED IN

02:30:16.608 --> 02:30:19.911 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PLACE. I THINK THERE

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:21.279 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:30:19.911 --> 02:30:22.280 region:rollup2

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:24.242 region:rollup2
TO THIS.

02:31:22.407 --> 02:31:25.577 region:rollup2

BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A

02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:36.788 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENTIAL SIDE AND THERE IS

02:31:33.618 --> 02:31:38.690 region:rollup2
ALSO. A A A PUNITIVE SIDE THAT

02:31:36.788 --> 02:31:40.892 region:rollup2

THE POLICE REPORT.

02:49:03.934 --> 02:49:06.870 region:rollup2
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE DID NOT

COMMON EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE

02:49:20.317 --> 02:49:23.987 region:rollup2

IT'S DIFFICULT TO SOLVE THEM

02:49:29.526 --> 02:49:31.928 region:rollup2

ACT IS BALANCE ALREADY BALANCED

02:55:36.025 --> 02:55:39.295 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE NEED TO PROTECT

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:40.797 region:rollup2
VICTIMS AND WITNESSES.

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:42.465 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIXTY

02:55:40.797 --> 02:55:44.067 region:rollup2

WE THINK THOSE PROTECTIONS AND

DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO

03:04:55.318 --> 03:04:58.054 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW

ALREADY PROVIDES FOR THAT

03:04:58.054 --> 03:05:00.556 region:rollup2

HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WHO ARE

03:05:10.766 --> 03:05:13.669 region:rollup2
WITNESSES TO ABUSE.

03:05:12.301 --> 03:05:15.871 region:rollup2

CHILDREN INVOLVED.

03:05:21.911 --> 03:05:25.514 region:rollup2
IT IS TO SAY THE LEAST A

03:05:24.213 --> 03:05:27.550 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT SITUATION.

03:05:25.514 --> 03:05:28.718 region:rollup2
ONE WHERE THE COURT NEEDS TO

03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:30.019 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE NUMBER OF COMPETING

NEEDS TO HAVE TOOLS AT THEIR

03:05:31.854 --> 03:05:35.891 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL BEYOND.

03:05:33.322 --> 03:05:37.393 region:rollup2

03:05:51.674 --> 03:05:55.411 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT FAMILY COURTS

03:05:53.642 --> 03:05:57.713 region:rollup2
HAVE THE EXPERTISE. THAT IS

03:05:55.411 --> 03:05:59.315 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THIS KIND

NOT.

03:06:01.984 --> 03:06:06.455 region:rollup2
AND WE OUT STATE THINK THAT THE

03:06:04.387 --> 03:06:07.890 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT ASK THE

03:06:06.455 --> 03:06:09.358 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL COURTS TO DO THE JOB

03:06:07.890 --> 03:06:11.560 region:rollup2
THAT THE FAMILY COURTS ARE

03:06:09.358 --> 03:06:13.496 region:rollup2
ALREADY DOING. WE RESPECTFULLY

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:14.730 region:rollup2
ASK FOR YOUR NOVEL.

THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES

THE QUIRK.

03:06:21.303 --> 03:06:24.573 region:rollup2
UP SO MISTER DOYLE ERA

03:06:23.439 --> 03:06:29.545 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATIONS ZACHAREK CONVERTS A

03:06:29.545 --> 03:06:32.048 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MURATSUCHI YES.

03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:32.848 region:rollup2
.

03:06:32.048 --> 03:06:34.617 region:rollup2
SO UNDER CURRENT LAW.

03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:35.351 region:rollup2
.

03:06:34.617 --> 03:06:38.287 region:rollup2
THEY CAN FIT THE JUDGES CAN

03:06:35.351 --> 03:06:39.822 region:rollup2
ISSUE A RESTRAINING ORDER IS AN

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:40.990 region:rollup2
A IS SET THAT'S CORRECT AND

03:06:39.822 --> 03:06:42.425 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS LAW.

03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:44.260 region:rollup2
IT WOULD STILL BE OPTIONAL.

03:06:42.425 --> 03:06:46.195 region:rollup2
FOR THE JUDGES TO ISSUE A

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:47.296 region:rollup2
RESTRAINING ORDER.

03:06:46.195 --> 03:06:50.066 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SIMPLY.

03:06:47.296 --> 03:06:52.468 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THAT RESTRAINING ORDER

03:06:50.066 --> 03:06:55.571 region:rollup2
TO TO. TO ALSO.

03:06:52.468 --> 03:06:56.672 region:rollup2
AFFECT A TRIAL.

03:06:55.571 --> 03:06:58.874 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THAT IS THAT'S AT THE

03:06:56.672 --> 03:06:59.842 region:rollup2
JUDGE'S DISCRETION OF I GOT THAT

03:06:58.874 --> 03:07:01.577 region:rollup2
RIGHT YES YOU'RE CORRECT. SO

03:06:59.842 --> 03:07:02.711 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALL WITH THE JUDGE'S

03:07:01.577 --> 03:07:04.647 region:rollup2
DISCRETION.

03:07:02.711 --> 03:07:06.182 region:rollup2
SO FOR THE ACLU Y. AND VOTED

03:07:04.647 --> 03:07:08.818 region:rollup2
AGAINST SOME OF THESE LAWS WHICH

03:07:06.182 --> 03:07:11.087 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND THAT PROHIBITION. BUT

03:07:08.818 --> 03:07:12.721 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE IF A JUDGE SHE SITS

03:07:11.087 --> 03:07:14.724 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO PROTECT CHILD I'VE

03:07:12.721 --> 03:07:16.459 region:rollup2
GOT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

03:07:14.724 --> 03:07:17.760 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE'S ALSO ISSUE WE WANT

03:07:16.459 --> 03:07:20.629 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT MOTHER. SO I DON'T

03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:22.364 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS ADDS A.

03:07:20.629 --> 03:07:25.000 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ONEROUS.

03:07:22.364 --> 03:07:25.601 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT IN TERMS OF SOMEONE

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:28.404 region:rollup2
STAYING AWAY.

03:07:25.601 --> 03:07:29.038 region:rollup2
.

03:07:28.404 --> 03:07:30.940 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON

03:07:29.038 --> 03:07:32.341 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:07:30.940 --> 03:07:33.976 region:rollup2
WELL AGAIN I WOULD RAISE THE

03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:36.178 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE FOR ABOUT FIRST

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:37.413 region:rollup2
I I WOULD SAY IN MANY OF THOSE

03:07:36.178 --> 03:07:39.615 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES THE RESTRAINING

03:07:37.413 --> 03:07:43.152 region:rollup2
ORDER STAYING THE STAY AWAY FROM

03:07:39.615 --> 03:07:44.320 region:rollup2
THE MOTHER WHO NAM WOULD ALSO.

03:07:43.152 --> 03:07:45.654 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE PROTECT

03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:47.056 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN.

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:48.457 region:rollup2
THE CASES WHERE THAT'S NOT GOING

03:07:47.056 --> 03:07:50.960 region:rollup2
TO BE TRUE I THINK ARE THE ONES

03:07:48.457 --> 03:07:53.329 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE CHILDREN ARE THE

03:07:50.960 --> 03:07:54.730 region:rollup2
CHILDREN OF THE. THE PERSON WHO

03:07:53.329 --> 03:07:56.632 region:rollup2
WHO IS THE DEFENDANT.

03:07:54.730 --> 03:07:57.233 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I

03:07:56.632 --> 03:07:59.935 region:rollup2
THINK THAT A FAMILY COURT HAS

03:07:57.233 --> 03:08:01.670 region:rollup2
OF.

03:07:59.935 --> 03:08:03.672 region:rollup2
BETTER ABILITY TO.

03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:05.207 region:rollup2
.

03:08:03.672 --> 03:08:07.276 region:rollup2
ADDRESS ALL OF ALL OF THE

03:08:05.207 --> 03:08:11.847 region:rollup2
INTERESTS IN THE SITUATION AND.

03:08:07.276 --> 03:08:14.750 region:rollup2
AND CRAFT IN ORDER THAT MANY.

03:08:11.847 --> 03:08:16.118 region:rollup2
RESTRICT THE PERSON FROM CONTACT

03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:16.952 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE CHILDREN MOST WHILE

03:08:16.118 --> 03:08:18.154 region:rollup2
STILL ALLOWING FOR EXAMPLE

03:08:16.952 --> 03:08:20.456 region:rollup2
VISITATION.

03:08:18.154 --> 03:08:22.691 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

03:08:20.456 --> 03:08:24.460 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON HAS AN INTEREST IN

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:26.128 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING A RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:28.230 region:rollup2
WITH HIS OR HER CHILDREN.

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:29.698 region:rollup2
SO I IF I UNDERSTAND THIS THEN

03:08:28.230 --> 03:08:32.601 region:rollup2
MISTER DOYLE.

03:08:29.698 --> 03:08:36.038 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD TRANSFERRED THAT

03:08:32.601 --> 03:08:38.107 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY. AWAY WHO WHO HAS

03:08:36.038 --> 03:08:38.674 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

03:08:38.107 --> 03:08:39.108 region:rollup2
REALLY RAINING ORDER FOR THE

03:08:38.674 --> 03:08:39.708 region:rollup2
MOTHER.

03:08:39.108 --> 03:08:41.510 region:rollup2
IS THAT IN FAMILY COURT OR IN

03:08:39.708 --> 03:08:43.445 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL COURT.

03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:44.780 region:rollup2
WELL THE THE ORIGINAL PROTECTIVE

03:08:43.445 --> 03:08:46.582 region:rollup2
ORDER COMES OUT OF THE CRIMINAL

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:47.149 region:rollup2
COURT MUSIC CRIMINAL GETS A

03:08:46.582 --> 03:08:48.117 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE ORDER WHICH IT WE

03:08:47.149 --> 03:08:51.053 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:08:48.117 --> 03:08:52.721 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS EXPANDED HE CAN BE

03:08:51.053 --> 03:08:54.857 region:rollup2
CAN BE EXPANDED UNDER.

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:55.858 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES OF

03:08:54.857 --> 03:08:57.827 region:rollup2
YEAH AT THE DISCRETION OF THE

03:08:55.858 --> 03:08:59.828 region:rollup2

03:08:57.827 --> 03:09:01.697 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE CHILDREN AND

03:08:59.828 --> 03:09:04.433 region:rollup2
VERY OFTEN THE CHILDREN OF THE

03:09:01.697 --> 03:09:07.303 region:rollup2
MARRIAGE OR THE RELATIONSHIP.

03:09:04.433 --> 03:09:09.572 region:rollup2
BUT A WHAT DID THE BILL PROVIDE

SUPERVISED VISITATION IF THAT'S

ALONG TO THE FAMILY COURT ORDER

03:09:35.497 --> 03:09:38.901 region:rollup2
CAN HAPPEN.

03:09:36.665 --> 03:09:40.569 region:rollup2

CIRCUMSTANCES.

03:10:07.529 --> 03:10:11.867 region:rollup2
SO THE FAMILY COURT COULD STILL

MAKE ASSIST DECISION TO ALLOW.

03:10:11.867 --> 03:10:13.035 region:rollup2

LET'S GO THERE THERE IS A

03:14:00.796 --> 03:14:03.098 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT WAS

03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:03.732 region:rollup2
IT ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:05.200 region:rollup2

03:14:05.634 --> 03:14:09.638 region:rollup2
WHO HAVING TO DO WITH TEACHERS?

03:14:07.202 --> 03:14:12.140 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY UNDER EXISTING LAW

03:14:09.638 --> 03:14:15.878 region:rollup2
THE SHERIFFS ARE REQUIRED TO

03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:16.778 region:rollup2

.

03:14:20.082 --> 03:14:21.250 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER

03:14:20.616 --> 03:14:22.451 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:14:21.250 --> 03:14:24.486 region:rollup2
JUSTICE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO BAKE

03:14:22.451 --> 03:14:26.255 region:rollup2
A SIMILAR REPORT. SO THERE'S

03:14:24.486 --> 03:14:27.456 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT A LOT OF BENEFIT TO

03:14:26.255 --> 03:14:30.526 region:rollup2
THAT ADDITIONAL.

03:14:27.456 --> 03:14:34.897 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO AND THE IDEA OF

03:14:30.526 --> 03:14:36.965 region:rollup2
REPORTING. ON THE AT A. THE FACT

03:14:34.897 --> 03:14:39.067 region:rollup2

03:14:36.965 --> 03:14:40.502 region:rollup2
IS THERE. NO.

03:14:39.067 --> 03:14:41.169 region:rollup2
CAN A PRE JUDGMENT ON THE

03:14:40.502 --> 03:14:43.105 region:rollup2
TEACHER BECAUSE ARREST DOES NOT

03:14:41.169 --> 03:14:45.007 region:rollup2
MEAN CONVICTION DOESN'T MEAN

03:14:43.105 --> 03:14:46.808 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS. OF PROBABLE

03:14:45.007 --> 03:14:48.710 region:rollup2
CAUSE EVEN NECESSARILY IT JUST

03:14:46.808 --> 03:14:50.846 region:rollup2
SIMPLY MEANS THAT SOMEBODY WAS

03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:52.447 region:rollup2
ARRESTED FOR A CRIME. AND YOU

03:14:50.846 --> 03:14:54.883 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE A VERY DELETERIOUS

03:14:52.447 --> 03:14:55.851 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON A TEACHER'S CAREER FOR

NO GOOD PURPOSE

03:14:55.851 --> 03:14:58.921 region:rollup2

WE'RE DOING I BELIEVE WITH THE

03:14:58.921 --> 03:15:02.291 region:rollup2

ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINES AND

03:20:12.734 --> 03:20:17.806 region:rollup2

03:20:15.337 --> 03:20:19.708 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RATE AT WHICH THEIR

COMMENTS.

03:20:36.625 --> 03:20:38.927 region:rollup2
SO WHY DO WE CHOOSE TWENTY TWO

03:20:37.926 --> 03:20:39.861 region:rollup2
AYE TWICE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS

03:20:38.927 --> 03:20:41.830 region:rollup2

THAT VERY ISSUE AND IT WE LOOKED

03:20:48.270 --> 03:20:53.375 region:rollup2
AT A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVES WE

03:20:51.439 --> 03:20:54.709 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF CREATING A STANDARD

03:20:53.375 --> 03:20:56.244 region:rollup2
RATE JUST A DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WE

03:20:54.709 --> 03:20:59.047 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT'S NOT REASONABLE

03:20:56.244 --> 03:21:00.582 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ECONOMIES CHANGE AND SO

03:20:59.047 --> 03:21:02.284 region:rollup2
CREATING A DOLLAR AMOUNT

03:21:00.582 --> 03:21:05.020 region:rollup2
STATUTES SEEMED A LITTLE BIT.

03:21:02.284 --> 03:21:07.355 region:rollup2
INFLEXIBLE WE THOUGHT ABOUT JUST

03:21:05.020 --> 03:21:09.224 region:rollup2

03:21:15.697 --> 03:21:20.902 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE VALUE FOR

03:21:17.165 --> 03:21:24.139 region:rollup2
THEIR TIME GIVING TO SOCIETY IS

03:21:20.902 --> 03:21:26.808 region:rollup2
REASONABLE WE DIDN'T WANT THEM

03:21:24.139 --> 03:21:28.677 region:rollup2
TO BE. PAYING LESS THAN SOMEBODY

03:21:26.808 --> 03:21:30.645 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PAYING IN FINES SO WE

03:21:28.677 --> 03:21:32.881 region:rollup2
TRIED TO CREATE A MIDDLE GROUND

03:21:30.645 --> 03:21:35.584 region:rollup2
THAT EQUATED THE VALUE OF THEIR

03:21:32.881 --> 03:21:41.156 region:rollup2
TIME TO THE AMOUNT THAT THEY

03:21:35.584 --> 03:21:42.524 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PAYING IN DOLLARS.

03:21:41.156 --> 03:21:45.193 region:rollup2
