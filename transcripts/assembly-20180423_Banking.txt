WE ARE GOING TO START. ARE AYE APRIL TWENTY THIRD HEARING WE HAVE. TWO BILLS TODAY. WE WILL STAR AS A SUB COMMITTEE UNTIL WE HAVE QUORUM AND ONCE WE HAVE QUORUM AND WE WILL. UP PROCEED AS A REGULAR HEARING SO TO START UP FOR ABOUT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY. WITH THE I. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE GOOD AFTER CHIP GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER. ASSESSMENTS ARM. MIA WITH CUMULATIVE ASSESSMENT SCORING FROM AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. TO OVER TWO POINT SIX BILLION BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO MAKE BETTER BY PROTECTING CONSUMERS. RECENT REPORTS INDICATE THAT DEFAULT RATES ARE RISING AS THE PACE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO GROW. DEFAULTING ON A PACE ASSESSMENT CAN LEAD TO FORECLOSURE. OR A COUNTY TAX SALE THE CAUSES PROPERTY OWNERS TO LOSE THEIR HOMES. WELL MAJOR STRIDES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SECURE STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. AND ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ABOVE SP TWO FORTY TWO AND A. B. TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR LAST YEAR. WORK WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WAS HASTILY DRAFTED ON THE FINAL NIGHT OF SESSION AND CONTAIN A NUMEROUS THAT CONTAIN NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES AGREED WOULD NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. WHEN AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WAS HEARD BY THE SENATE INSISTS ASSEMBLY POLICY COMMITTEES ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LEGISLATIVE YEAR. THERE WAS SO MUCH CONSENSUS ON THE NEED FOR SUCH CLEAN UP THE LETTER TO THE JOURNAL COMMITTED TO SUCH AN EFFORT. THE LETTER SPECIFICALLY SAID I COMMIT TO WORKING SUPPORTIVE BELIEVE PAT TO PASS A MEASURE ON THE ISSUE OF UNDERWRITING RAISED ON PAGE TEN OF THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AS AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT A HOMEOWNERS ABILITY TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT IS FULLY VERIFIED BEFORE SIGNING AN ASSESSMENT. OR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. AND BEFORE WORK ON THE IMPROVEMENT ACTUALLY BEGINS. THE TIMING OF THE VERIFICATION IS CRUCIAL TO DECREASING THE NUMBER OF DEFAULTS AND REDUCING THE RISK OF PROPERTY OWNERS LOSING THEIR HOMES. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE RECENT FIRES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS WHOSE HOMES REDUCED DESTROYED AND HAD PACE ASSESSMENTS FOR HOME IMPROVEMENTS. MAY NOT CARRY SUGGESTS THE EFFICIENT PROPERTY INSURANCE TO COVER THE FULL VALUE OF THE HOME AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENT. THESE RESIDENTS MAY BE REQUIRED TO CONTINUE PAYING FOR AN IMPROVEMENT THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. THIS BILL AIMS TO RECTIFY THAT SUCH A SITUATION BY REQUIRING PACE ADMINISTRATORS. TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PROPERTY OWNERS. THAT THEY SHOULD CONTACT THEIR INSURANCE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE TO COVER THE PROPERTY AND THE IMPROVEMENTS. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE PROMOTES ACCOUNTABILITY FERVENT OVER SITE IRRESPONSIBLE LENDING WHILE ENSURING THAT THE PACE PROGRAM AND ITS PRINCIPLES OF ENERGY YOU WHEN. OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY CAN BE MAXIMIZE FOR THE YEARS TO COME. TODAY WITH ME AND I HAVE KAREN LANE FROM THE COUNTY TREASURES AND TAX COLLECTORS AS WELL AS COURTNEY JENSEN FROM THE CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN THE THINGS. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KARAWANG ABOVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURES AND TAX COLLECTORS. THANK YOU FOR. HAVING US TODAY. DIDN'T. CAN I JUST. WE DO HAVE QUORUM SO WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE. ROLE REALLY QUICKLY AND SALAS QUORUM SO WE CAN CONTINUE THE HEARING. LIMON. HERE LIMON HERE CHANT HERE CHEN HERE. BURKE COMING UP COSTA SORRY. BURKE. CALDERON. CERVANTES. CERVANTES HERE CHOI YEAH CHOI HERE BECAUSE ALMOST FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER YEAR. GRAYSON. STONE. WEBER. OKAY. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SO OF EQUIPMENT OTHER TO I PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WE THINK ARE MOST IMPORTANT IS SETTING RIGHT THE ORDER BY WHICH YOU WOULD DO ABILITY TO PAY WE'RE VERY STRONG PROPONENTS OF MAKING SURE THE UNDERWRITING. IS DONE A COMPLETE IN THE ABILITY TO PAY IS VERIFIED PRIOR TO WORK STARTING UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU COULD BE INTO A CONTRACTOR FOR A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN FIGURE OUT THAT YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY AFFORD IT AND YOU'RE STILL GOING ON THE HOOK FOR THAT MONEY. SO WE FEEL THAT THAT THAT CHANGE IN THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION. HIGHS PIECE ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT MORTGAGES BUT THEY LOOK A LOT LIKE A MORTGAGE AND NOT THEY SURVIVE THEY AYE IF YOU DON'T PAY IT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR HOME. ULTIMATELY AFTER FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS THE PANEL HOW THE COUNTY HANDLES IT CONCILIAR LOSE YOUR HOME BUT ACTUALLY A UNLIKE MORTGAGES THAT ACTUALLY SURVIVES BANKRUPTCY AND TAX SALE SO IF THE HOME HAD A PIECE ASSESSMENT ON IT. AND IT WENT TO TAX BILL WHOEVER BUYS IT IS STILL GONNA PICK UP THE REST OF THAT PIECE ASSESSMENT SO IT IS A VERY STRONG LEAN. AND WE THINK THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE CRITICAL IN THIS AREA THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL THAT WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THE INSURANCE PIECE. UP CINEMA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE AT EIGHTY HOMES BURNED DOWN TO THE GROUND IN THE FIRES IN THE NORTH BAY. AND AT THAT HAD PIECE OF SUBSTANCE ON THEM WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR INTO THEIR PACE ASSESSMENT TIME WHEN THEY WORK. BUT THEY ARE STILL ON THE HOOK FOR THAT PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT EXIST ANYMORE AND WE WE KEEP HEARING THAT THE HOMEOWNERS OR UNDER INSURED TO REBUILD THEIR DWELLINGS LET ALONE THE IMPROVEMENT. THOSE PROPONENTS OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AFTER I'VE ATTAINED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE AUTHOR FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT ALL. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES ABOUT RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF CLICK THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMERS COALITION WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE WOULD MAKE CERTAIN THAT HOMEOWNERS ABILITY TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT IS REVIEWED BEFORE SIGNING ASSESSMENT OR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT BEFORE ANY WORK ON. THOSE IMPROVEMENTS ACTUALLY BEGAN ABILITY TO PAY ANALYSIS ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS IF CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE A ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ENTERED INTO AN OBLIGATION THIS IS COMMON SENSE AND STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE LENDING INDUSTRY TODAY. WHEN FIRST CHECK THE MAP LATER IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE WAY TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD WE ABSOLUTELY URGE LEGISLATURE HAVE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THANK YOU AND WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS COURT AGENTS ON THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. UNION ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. BUT IF YOU'RE UP ON THE DS FROM THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING ALSO IN SUPPORT. SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS ROGERS I'M HERE REPRESENTING BY GREEN ENERGY FUND. WHY GREEN IS ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PAYS PROVIDERS AND RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AND MULTI FAMILY PROPERTIES FOR CONTEXT? WHY GREEN HAS COMPLETED MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS ON PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE? IT'S RESULTED IN NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF CO TWO ABATED. AND IT'S HELP SAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO ACTUALLY OUT RUN SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO THOUSAND HOMES FOR ONE YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE FIRST PACE LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHY GREEN ENERGY FUND HAS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT SOME OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. IN PAYS FINANCING IN THE COUNTRY THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT REMEMBER AB TWENTY SIX NINETY THREE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN. AS WELL AS S. B. TWO FORTY TWO SEVEN AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WE ARE AMENDING TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL. UP WE AS AN INDUSTRY ARE COMMITTED TO MEETING THE PRIMARY GOAL SET FORTH BY THE LEGISLATURE AND REINFORCED OVER THE LAST DECADE. AND THAT'S TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND BROAD CONSUMER FINANCING AS WELL AS CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WHAT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY ASKING TODAY IS FOR YOU TO CONSIDER FURTHER REFINEMENTS TO AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE THAT WILL ADDRESS NECESSARY TECHNICAL CHANGES? WHILE HOLDING OFF ON FURTHER SUBSTANTIVE SHIFTS IN PACE POLICY UNTIL AT A MINIMUM WE FINISHED IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS OF THE BEEN PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE BILL IS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD MOVE THE TIMING OF THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION AND IF AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE PASSED AS IT'S WRITTEN IT WOULD MOVE IT UP PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION OF THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A TECHNICAL CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO PACE IT WOULD TREAT PACE AS A MORTGAGE PRODUCTS WHICH YOU HEARD IS NOT THE INTENT OF SPACE FINANCING. WE WOULD LIKE PAYS TO BE ADMINISTERED THE WAY THAT IT'S DESIGNED AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF CONSUMER FINANCING. UNDER THE STATE LAW A CONSUMER MAY CHOOSE WITH IT WITHIN THREE DAYS TO CANCEL THEIR PACE ASSESSMENT. AND MAY CHOOSE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF FINANCING FROM PACE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR HOME. CANCELING PASTE IS NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE HOMEOWNER NEEDS TO CANCEL THEIR HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT AT THE TWO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CONSIDERED INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE ANOTHER. FURTHER WHILE THE PROPONENTS OF THE CHANGE ARGUE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. IN REALITY WE ARE WE AS PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS DO A HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE PROPERTY OWNERS ABILITY TO PAY RIGHT AWAY. THE MORE CUMBERSOME VERIFICATION PROCESS OF THAT ABILITY TO PAY TAKES PLACE DURING UNDERWRITING IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT TOP LEVEL ANALYSIS AND THE ACTUAL VERIFICATION THAT VERIFIED AMOUNT OF AN ABILITY TO REPAY. UNDER AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WE ARE ON THE HOOK FOR THE DIFFERENCE. SO THE LAW THAT YOU HELPED WRITE AND PASSED LAST YEAR SHIFTED THAT ADDITIONAL LIABILITY ONTO THE PACE ADMINISTRATORS AWAY FROM THE HOMEOWNERS. AYE IN THE EXECUTION OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AYE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THE. COMING MONTHS THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF RENOVATE AMERICA. RELATE AMERICA'S A SAN DIEGO BASED COMPANY THEY'RE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF PACE FINANCING MAY WORK WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CITIES AND COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE. I AM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHY PACE EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH IS THAT. I'M LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZED THAT MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND ARE TERRIBLY INEFFICIENT AND THAT MEANS WE'RE RUNNING ENTIRE POWER PLANTS. SIMPLY TO HEAT AND COOL THE OUTSIDE SO THEY CHOSE TO USE THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT BONDING AUTHORITY TO HELP PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR HOME MAKE THE ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENT CHOICES. YOU HEARD SOME OF THE STATISTICS I'M I'LL JUST TO ADD TO THOSE. THE AMOUNT OF CO TWO THAT WE'VE SAVED ANNUALLY IS THE EQUIVALENT OF OVER FIVE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND. I'M FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION TONNES WHICH IS LIKE NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CARS OFF THE ROAD FOR A YEAR SOUL SPARE YOU THE REST OF THE LAUNDRY LET'S BUT IT'S QUITE SIGNIFICANT. I'M ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP TO ADVANCE THE PROGRAM BRAG RECOGNIZE ITS BENEFITS AND WORK WITH US TO MAKE IT STRONGER. AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TRY TO AVOID SOME OF THE HYPERBOLE THAT COMES UP IN THE CONTEXT OF DISCUSSING PACE. SO RENOVATE AS THE LARGEST PROVIDER THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A SINGLE FORECLOSURE IN OUR PROGRAM WE ALSO ENJOY A GREATER THAN NINETY EIGHT POINT SEVEN ON TIME REPAYMENT RATE. SO IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT I WHICH SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AND THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE FACTS ARE ON THE GROUND. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY MEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND MANY OF YOU WE HAVE SET UP THESE THREE BILLS OVER THE PAST YEAR WHICH CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF DISCLOSURES. A PACKAGE OF FAR REACHING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WHICH MEANS THAT NO ONE CAN ENTER INTO A PACE ASSESSMENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING ON THE PHONE WITH A REAL LIVE PERSON AND HAVING THEM WALK THROUGH. ON THE COMPONENTS OF. THE ASSESSMENT AND ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND IT A DB O. READ LEAST LAST WEEK. ITS DRAFT REGULATIONS IN THIS AREA I'M SO WE REALLY HAVE. MADE IMPORTANT STRIDES WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMEN TO MAKE SURE THAT PEACE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WHILE THE SAME TIME. ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP ON CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T. GO TOO FAR AND UNDERMINE. THE THE VERY PREMISE OF THE PROGRAM IN THE MARKETPLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY IN OPPOSITION. MARGARET LET'S NOT HAVEEVER NEW FINANCIAL I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGS BEFORE BEEN THE ANALYSIS BY THEIR COMMITTEE HAVE CONCUR WITH THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY I JUST ADD WOULD ALSO SOME OF THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO HELP SAVE TEN BILLION GALLONS OF WATER SO. LET'S FIX IT AND THAT NOT BRING AN END TO IT THINK. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY CHEN AND A SECOND BY HELD AROUND. DOCTOR TRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ARE ARE LOOKING AT THE. I CANNOT DIAGRAM OF FOR A TIDY UP PROCESS IN THEIR CURRENT LAW AND THE PROCESS SO. AT THE WATER BE IMPLEMENTED IF THIS PASSES SO. IT MAKES SENSE. TO ASSESS ABILITY TO REPAY BEFORE THE. PAYS SO CONTRACT IS SET EXECUTED. BUT THE I WONDER. WHY? IT HAS TO BE. LEGISLATIVE. IF THIS IS A WARM OUR COMMONSENSE SIR. WHY ANYONE NOT WOULD GO INTO CONTRACTOR? IF FUTURE ARTISTS SELL THAT TO ME. I WOULDN'T WHAT A KIND OF A FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR GO INTO. BOB BEFORE I SIGN UP BUT SO IS MET THE TEST OF OUR. MY PAYMENT ABILITY BY YOU END UP BY ME CONSUMER ALREADY BEING TAKEN PLACE. BUT THE. THE LAW HAS TO TELL YOU. THAT YOU HAVE TO ASSESS THE ABILITY. WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT OF THAT THE PEACE PROGRAM IS THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE OR DON'T LOAN? BOB PAY MONTH OR BE LUMPED. IN TWO. THOUGHT THE IRAQ ATTACKS YOU GOT PAY RIGHT IT AND I SO SO SO I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT ADDITIONAL TAX OUT HAVE TO PAY. I THINK THE IDEA AND AND THE AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS COULD SPEAK FURTHER TO THIS BUT THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT EVERYONE IS PERHAPS AS INTELLIGENT AS YOU WHEN. THE OPTIONS FOR PACE ARE PUT BEFORE THEM AND SO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN HAS HAVE LEADERSHIP ON THIS IN THE SOLAR BANANA PACES WHILE. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE ENTERING INTO PACE ASSESSMENTS ARE AWARE OF ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF IT SO THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS AN OBLIGATION THAT IS GOING ON THEIR TAX BILL. AND THAT THEIR HOUSE IS COLLATERAL FOR IT BEHIND AND SO THAT'S WHY TO ME THAT CONFIRM TERMS CALL SO THAT BEFORE YOU'RE ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT. YOU HAVE TO GET ON THE PHONE WITH A REAL LIVE PERSON AND WALK THROUGH STATUTORY QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT IS JUST A GOOD. SERVE MOTHERHOOD AND APPLE PIE CONSUMER PROTECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS UNDERSTAND THE CHOICE THAT THEY'RE MAKING WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO. UNDERTAKE A PROJECT THAT QUALIFIES FOR PACE AND CAN IMPROVE THE WATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THEIR HOME NAMIBIA I CAN ASK DO AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN NOT AGAIN COREY. A I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THOUGH APPEAR IT TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER. BY ASSESSING BY MOVING THAT PROCESS TO. ASSESS THE ABILITY IN THE ADVANCE. WHAT CRITERIA? ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING HOW WOULD SHE ASSESSED MEAN WHETHER I CAN REPAY MY DEBT ONE NOT THE IS IT GONNA BE MY CREDIT RATING WHAT WILL IT BE MY CASH RESERVES SO. YEAH YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD IN IN TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR LAST YEAR IT LAID OUT IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ALIMONY. AND WHAT YOU ARE REASONABLE HOUSE BASIC EXPENSES WERE GOING TO BE. WHAT REALLY WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS BILL IS AT NOBODY'S DISAGREEING WITH THE NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY CAN? ACTUALLY PAY THEIR PACE ASSESSMENT IN ADDITION TO THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT THEY HAVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS WHEN THE VERIFICATION PROCESS WHICH CAN BE VERY CUMBERSOME HAPPENS. IT IN THE PACE ASSESSMENT. THE IT AGAIN AT AS AS THE LAWS WRITTEN IT IS ON US AS WELL TO DETERMINE TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO REPAY. AS AN ADMINISTRATOR THAT WE'RE ON THE HOOK IF THEY CAN'T BUT ONCE THEY ENTER INTO THAT THE CONTRACT. A. WE'VE LAID OUT STEP BY STEP THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN LAW THAT'S ALREADY STATE LAW. AND I WOULD JUST ADD QUICKLY THAT. THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION WILL BE CONCLUDED BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT IS RECORDED AGAINST THE HOME SO NO ONE WILL HAVE A RECORD THAT PIECE ASSESSMENT RECORDED AGAINST THEIR HOME. PRIOR TO THAT ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION BEING COMPLETED BUT THAT THE B. FRANKA. CONTRACTOR YOU WOULD BE MORE ANXIOUS TO SELL THAT TO PRODUCT TO ME RATHER THAN. YOU'RE NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT TO MY ABILITY TO WEATHER INTO MY HOUSE A BEFORE RULES TO ENACT A SO YOU'LL BE IMPOSING ON ME OR HAD THIS OKAY BYE BYE. IN THE LATER I FIND OUT AND THAT AND THAT IS ALSO WHAT THE ORPHALI SAID TRYING TO REVERSE A MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND I HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY WHAT EXTRA AMOUNT TO OUR HAVE TO PAY ALONG WITH THE TAX. RIGHT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US AROUND THE LANGUAGE I'M AROUND UNDERWRITING AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT WITH HER GOING FORWARD. YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT THAT THE CONTRACTOR. IS NOT THE ONE WHO HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE HOMEOWNER HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT THAT'S ON THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS. AT SO THAT'S ANYTHING NOTHING CAN BE EXECUTED ON OUR END UNTIL THEY GO THROUGH THAT VERIFICATION PROCESS AND THROUGH THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WE LAID OUT THE CONFIRM TERMS CALLS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THAT HOMEOWNER CAN PAY SO THAT'S WHY I'M WONDERING. IF AUTHOR WHAT THE SPECIFIC A WAYS SO YOU AND I MAKE SURE THAT I WOULD HAVE LET BILLY TO TO PAY. THE FULL I SIGNED UP MY COUNTRY. MADAM CHAIR MAY I ADD THAT THE DEL IS. TOTALLY FOR IT. IS INSTITUTED SOME ABILITY TO PAY THE TERMINATION THAT. WHICH I THINK IS VERY SIMILAR TO A MORTGAGE EVEN THOUGH AT THIS MORTGAGE. IT'S AND I THINK THERE ISN'T TIME TO. A VERIFY THAT THEY CAN PAY THE PROBLEM THAT OBJECTION THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY WANT. THEY ARE THE CONTRACTORS THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE CONTRACTORS TO BEGIN WORK ON THE HOME. BEFORE THE FULL ABILITY TO DETERMINE TO OF ABILITY TO REPAY HAS BEEN TURMAN SO WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE HOMEOWNER. IS THAT THEY MAY ABANDONED PAYS FINANCING BUT THEIR SLOGAN BE ON THE HOOK FOR WHATEVER WORK. GETS DONE ON THE HOUSE AND SO THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT TWENTY SIXTY THREE IF IT'S PARTLY COUNTRY DOES ADDRESS IS MAKE SURE THAT. IT GOES IN ORDER BECAUSE IT SHOULDN'T BE TREATED LIKE IT'S AN IMPULSE BUY THE REGISTER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SECURED BY OUR HOME AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. ON IT YOU DON'T HAVE YOU CAN BE QUICK BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY. WHEN HIS BILL IS ADOPTED A CAN I CALL AFTER THEN YOU MISS. JUDGE THE MY ABILITY TO TO PAY WHEN I GO ALL BANKRUPT. SO LET ME I I'LL ACTUALLY TO SAY IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THE PACE ASSESSMENT RECORDED AGAINST YOUR HOME FOR AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS YOUR ABILITY TO PAY AND THAT'S WHAT WE THAT'S WHAT WE. I. PROHIBITED WHAT WORK I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING HERE. IS. BEING OBLIGATED TO THE UNDERLYING HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. AND THE WAY THAT THE BILLS THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR. DICTATE THAT THE PACE ADMINISTRATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONCLUSION OF AN ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION. AND WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY. CONCLUDED SO WE DO THE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND VERIFY THOSE DOCUMENTS SO IF YOU'RE MY HOMEOWNER AND I THINK HOW MUCH YOU MAKE EVERY YEAR AND GIVE YOU KNOW EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION AS. THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR INITIAL INITIAL ABILITY TO PAY AND DETERMINATION THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK BY STATUTE AND VERIFY ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO I'M THERE WILL NEVER BE A SITUATION WHICH A HOMEOWNERS ON THE HOOK FOR AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS THEIR ABILITY TO PAY YEAH IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD JUST READ TO YOU IT'S AS IF THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS ABILITY TO PAY THE. ANNUAL PACE OBLIGATION OF THE ACTUAL AMOUNT FINANCE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE PROPERTY OWNER IS OBLIGATED ON THE UNDERLYING HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR THAT'S US SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENCE. THAT'S STATE LAW. THAT'S CURRENT LAW. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WANT ALL WANT TO HAVE. CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS TO. WHAT SHASTA SO SAME ASSESSMENT OR TAKE PLACE ABOUT THE WHICH ONE WOULD BE DONE BEFORE BEFORE THE CONTRACT OR WHAT THE APPELLATE REVIEW ASSESSED FIRST EPISODE AS TO WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IT'S WHITE? MONNING THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI AGAIN THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO AND I KNOW THAT THEIR SO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A SHARED INTERESTS. AROUND THE GENERAL GOAL OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS OF ENSURING THAT WE STILL OFFER. AND THIS PRODUCT BUT ALSO YOU KNOW SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE. OF THE PROCESS AND ELEMENTS OF THE PROCESS AND THIS BILL DOES HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. BUT AS I REMEMBER A CAREFREE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD. JUST ONE REMINDER AND THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM AND THERE ARE GOOD PLAYERS IN THIS WE WANNA MAKE IT EVEN BETTER FOR AND PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO JUST SHARELITTLE MOMENT IS THAT ON FRIDAY ABOUT THREE FORTY FIVE I WAS AT MY RESIDENTS I PICK UP THE PHONE AND I WAS SOMEBODY TRYING TO SELL ME A PACE LOAN. I JUST THOUGHT OF IT OF SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU. WILL CALL THE ROLL. AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE MOTION DO PASSED COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. WE WANT AYE LIMON AYE CHEN. CHEN CHI ACOSTA. BURKE. CALDERON. CERVANTES. SAMANTHA'S AYE CHOI AYE CHOI AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE GRAYSON. STONE. WEBER. THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES THAT WE WILL HOLD THAT THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS. ALRIGHT NEXT FOR A TAKE ON A. B. THIRTY TWO OR SEVEN AND I'M GOING TO PASS A TOUR VICE CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AUNT MEMBERS A. B. THIRTY TWO A SEVEN WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS SURVEYED BY THE FINANCE BROKERS LICENSE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCE THE LAW. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IS VAGUE AND CIRCULAR LEADING TO CONFUSION FROM LENDERS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES THEY CAN PARTNER WITH WHEN ARRANGING LOANS. FURTHER THE DEFINITION OF PROGRAM EXISTING LAW WAS FORMULATED LONG BEFORE THE RISE OF THE INTERNET AND EVOLUTION OF ONLINE LEAD GENERATION. SO OUR LINE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WITH THIS ONLINE ACTIVITY IN MIND. LEAD GENERATORS PROVIDE VALUABLE MARKETING SERVICES TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES HOWEVER MANY ONLINE THE GENERATORS THAT SERVE THE LENDING INDUSTRY PROVIDE MORE THAN JUST MARKETING SERVICES. THESE ENTITIES ACT AS BROKERS WHEN THEY BRING BARS AND LENDERS TOGETHER IS TO ARRANGE A LOAN BASED ON SENSITIVE DATA PROVIDED BY A PROSPECT A BAR. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ONLINE THE GENERATORS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. AS THE STATE'S FINANCIAL REGULAR HERE REGULATOR THE DB ó IS CHARGED WITH REGULATING HOW BROKERS INTERACT WITH THE CONSUMERS TO ENSURE THAT BROKERS DO NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE PRACTICES TO STEER CONSUMERS INTO LOANS. THAT THEY DO NOT THAT DO NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS I AM WORKING WITH THE LENDERS AND THE LEE GENERATORS TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSES. THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNS IN OUR LENDING MARKETS WITHOUT PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON THE BUSINESS THAT WERE ON THE BUSINESS THAT WORK IN THIS AREA. THE BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE PART IN A BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND A COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. I WOULD LIKE TO TURN MY TIME OVER TO SUZANNE MARTIN DEL BUT THE CONSUMERS UNION TO TESTIFY AND SUPPORT THE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS SUZANNE MARTIN DOWN HALF OF CONSUMERS UNION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY NECESSARY IN COMMONSENSE A STEP FORWARD TO UPDATE AND CLARIFY WHAT IS APART UNDER EXISTING LAW WHEN. LENDERS FINANCE LENDERS USE COMPENSATED THIRD PARTIES WHETHER BRICK AND MORTAR OR ONLINE TO HELP FACILITATE LOANS. AS WE'VE SEEN IN MANY CONTEXTS WHEN YOU HAVE THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE BEING COMPENSATED TO MARKET AND FACILITATE LOANS SOMETIMES INCENTIVES ARE NOT ALWAYS ALIGNED. WITH CONSUMERS AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE. IF THIRD PARTIES PUSHING PEOPLE INTO LOANS THAT DO NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS THEREFORE WE WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR WHO I'M FALLS UNDER THAT DEFINITION OF BROKER AND THEREFORE DOES NEED TO SEEK. ADDITIONAL. SUPERVISION HAVE FROM THAT FROM THE DBF MORE FINANCIAL REGULATOR I'M SO WE SEE THIS IS VERY COMMON SIDES ON THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAWS VERY COMPLEX AND CERTAINLY HAS AREAS THAT MANY AREAS THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED BUT WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND ALSO ENSURES THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT. DE BECAUSE ABILITY TO USE ITS IMPORTANT SUPERVISORY REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT TOOLS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS IN OUR STATE FOR THE SO FOR THESE REASONS BASED ON THE SUPPORT REQUEST AYE BUT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF CLICK THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND BANKS THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. DRESSING UP ON VIDEOS FROM THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING ALSO IN SUPPORT. CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS MY COMMUTE TIME BEHALF OPPORTUNE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF YOU ENGAGE IN LENDING A BROKEN ACTIVISM CALIFORNIA YOU SHOULD HAVE A PROPER LICENSE AND PROPER REGULATION THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNMENT HAVE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPOSE MUST AMENDED LETTER ON FILE. I BELIEVE THE ANALYSIS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS CONTAINED IN THAT. ADDRESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONCERNS WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF WE THINK THIS IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WE DO AGREE THAT REFORMS ARE NECESSARY. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING. THEM WORKING THEM THANK YOU THINK. NAME'S JASON ROBERT I'LL HURT HIM AND GENERAL COUNSEL FOR A COMPANY CALLED LONG CALL CALIFORNIA WE'VE HELD OUR CFL IN DETAIL LICENSES SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. RESPECTIVELY WE ACT AS A LEAD GENERATOR SO WE HAVE. INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE AND HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS IN CALIFORNIA. IT IT IS NOT A SIMPLE PROCESS AND IT IS A. VERY VERY CRITICAL THAT LEAD GENERATION EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. SO WE. WE DO AGREE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY LEGISLATION AND AYE I CLAWED THROUGH MY FATHER'S CLOSET. TO FIND A NECKTIE FROM THE FIFTIES IN HONOR OF THE BROKER DEFINITION WHICH WAS PASSED IN THE FIFTIES. AND IT'S ANTIQUATED AND IT DOES NOT RESPECT WHAT WE DO AS AN ONLINE THE GENERATOR DOESN'T RESPECT. TECHNOLOGY TODAY THAT IS HELPING CONSUMERS FIND APPROPRIATE LENDERS BUT JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE. WHAT WE DO HAS TO BE RESPECTED AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE SITUATIONS WORSE FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA? A GOOD LEAD GENERATORS. THAT THEIR LENDERS VERY CAREFULLY GOODLY GENERATORS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT OVER PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING. GOODLY GENERATORS WILL NOT TELL YOU I'M GONNA FIND YOU THE BEST RATES THE BEST TERMS THE BEST LOAN THE LOAN THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU. BECAUSE LEAD GENERATION IS IS REALLY A CONSUMER AGNOSTIC ACTIVITY. THIS IS PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATION AS DRAFTED. IT CONFLATES LEAD GENERATION AND BROKERING. BROKERING AS EVERYBODY KNOWS OF THAT DEALT WITH THE MORTGAGE BROKER OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF BROKER BROKERING INVOLVES ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE DEEPER THAN JUST BRINGING TWO PARTIES TOGETHER BROKERS WILL FIGHT FOR YOU OR THEY SHOULD BROKERS WILL SAY LET ME FIND THE LOAN THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU LET ME SHOP AROUND AND GET THE BEST RATES AND THE BEST TERMS. LET ME COLLECT DOCUMENTS VERIFY EVERYTHING GET YOUR SIGNATURES THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT A BROKER WILL DO. THAT A LEAD GENERATOR DOESN'T DO. SO JUST TWEAKING THE DEFINITION OF BROKER. TO ENCOMPASS LEAD GENERATORS DOES NOT RESPECTED THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE PLAY. BADLY GENERATORS ARE OUT THERE. AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND I HAVE PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT BADLY GENERATORS DO AND THE HARM THAT THEY BRING TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. SO LET ME SEE MONEY STEP BACK AND AND TO STATE SOMETHING THAT'S PROBABLY OBVIOUS. CONSUMERS START THEIR SEARCH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ONLINE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A FINANCIAL SOLUTION. AND CONSUMERS WANT. AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER TO THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS THAT'S WHY ONLINE LEAD GENERATION EXIST AND THAT'S ALSO WHY IT'S DANGEROUS. SO YOU CAN EITHER HAPPEN UPON A GOODLY GENERATOR WHO'S NOT GOING TO MAKE MISREPRESENTATIONS TO YOU WHO'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO YOU. PROTECT YOUR DATA LIKE IT IS A SACRED OBLIGATION AND ONLY WORK WITH LENDERS THEY HAVE ADDED THOSE OF THE GOOD GUYS. THE BAD GUYS ARE OUT THERE AND HEAR A COMPLAINT AFTER COMPLAINT I HAVE A THOUSAND OF THESE LITERALLY. HERE'S A COMPLAINT FROM A PERSON ONLINE THAT SAID. THEY CLAIMED TO BE CASH NOT U. S. SAY THEY SENATE BEEN APPROVED FOR A LOAN THEY ASKED ME TO PURCHASE GOOGLE PLAY CARDS. FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO IMPROVE MY CREDIT SCORE. I'M READING QUOTING BY THE WAY BEING A DUMB* I DID THEN THE AMOUNT WENT UP LONG STORY SHORT I'M AN IDIOT AND I JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE SO FAR FOR THEIR STEM. HERE'S ANOTHER WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO GO TO WALMART BUY GIFT CARDS AND READ NUMBERS.% TO THEM ON THE BACK OF THE CARDS TO REBUILD MY CREDIT I NEED THESE TYPES OF THINGS GO ON AND ON AND ON. SO MY POINT IS WITH SOME GOES ONLINE LOOKING FOR CONSUMER FINANCE ESPECIALLY SHORT TERM EMERGENCY CREDIT. WE HOPE THEY FIND SOMEONE LIKE US WHO IS VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF THE MARKETING MESSAGES THAT WE GIVE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF THE DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE. AND WE STE CONNECT THEM WITH GOOD LENDERS. OR THEY CAN FIND THE BAD GUYS. SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS LEAD GENERATION WHAT IS BROKERING. AND LET'S CRAFT LEGISLATION THAT RESPECTS. BUT THESE ARE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. THE IN THE LANGUAGE AND A. B. THIRTY TWO A SEVEN AS IT'S DRAFTED RIGHT NOW WANTS TO MAKE LEAD GENERATORS COVERED AS BROKERS BY SIMPLY SAYING IF YOU TRANSMIT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. YOU ARE A BROKER. AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS DEFINED AS SENSITIVE NONPUBLIC INFORMATION. THOSE TERMS ARE NOT DEFINED. TRANSFERRING A LEAD QUOTE UNQUOTE IS NOT DEFINED TRANSFERRING A REFERRAL THANK YOU VERY ONE NOT DIVIDED WRAPPED UP. I CAN. TYPE DAVID CANTON ON BEHALF THAT ABOUT MIDDLE POMBO OF UPPER LAKE TRIBE. UNDER THE DODD FRANK ACT TRIBES ARE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN BOTH LENDING AND. ONLINE LEAD GENERATION. THE BILL CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE AN ON RAMP FOR TRIBES WE JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE WHICH WOULD ALLOW TRIED WHICH HER. OF FEDERALLY ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE THIS ARE NOT PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA NOT CUT OUT HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF I THINK WEEK WE WILL GET THERE AS WE MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE. THE OTHER ONE IS NOT POSITION MARGARET LATCHING ON BEHALF OF NERD LA WE'RE NOT OPPOSED WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF WE APPRECIATE HER TACKLING THIS DIFFICULT ISSUE. OF WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS UPDATED TO REFLECT THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE THAT EXISTS TODAY AND THAT IT'S NARROWLY CRAFTED OTHER SOME COUPLE OF. EDITIONS OF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BUT THAT I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE IS ADDRESSING SO WE APPRECIATE NARROWING THE BILL AND WHY CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE DO ADDRESS THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE TODAY AS IT EXISTS AND DOESN'T JUST REPRESENT THE LAW DOESN'T JUST REPRESENT A BRICK AND MORTAR WORLD THAT WE'VE MOVED BEYOND THANK YOU. SALINAS POLICE SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WE ALSO WOULD CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON REFINING SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL GOING FORWARD.

MORTGAGE OUT WE HAVE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO THREE POINT SOMETHING IN A VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR. AND THEY SAID THE LENDINGTREE. AND AND LENDING TREE I HEARD ABOUT IT THE LAPTOP WERE AYE I GET THE IMPRESSION I REPLIED THE ONE QUESTION AFTER ANOTHER. COLLECTED A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH MY NAME AND ADDRESS SO WHAT ABOUT THE LOW FIT. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND AS SOON AS I WAS. IT AS A SAN. JUST A PHONE COSTS. MEANING RIGHT AWAY. WELL MY GOD WHAT DID I DO. IT WAS SO NOW I KNOW THAT WAS TO LEAD THE GENERATOR. SO WHAT'S THE MATTER LAND. SO. I I I I YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW. I WAS SO IGNORANT. AND THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING DONE. OUR. AND IF THERE'S ANY DISTINCTION. IF I HAD KNOWN. THAT COMPANY WAS SET TRYING TO. THE INTO DO SUCH A GOOD LENDERS. SAYING SOMETHING ENOUGHT TO IDENTIFY. THEMSELVES ARE AND INFORM THE CONSUMER SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. GOOD THAT. SO IN THIS CASE ESSENTIAL OPPOSING. OKAY ARE  <u><c.green>IN MY CASE YOU</c></u> CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT'S THAT THE OFFICER TRYING TO DO. SO THAT'S THE ONE AREA MAY BE YOU KNOW. A HOW WE CAN. NOW A. WHY YOU ARE A POOR SEEN? IN A TOOL THAT THE ASPECT THAT BILL WOULD FACE A. ASSEMBLYMEMBER IMANI SO TRY TO PROTECT THEIR CONSUMERS SAID THAT'S ONE QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER IT AND THEN I HAVE SOME FUND WHAT QUESTIONS SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI. DO WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE CONCEPT OF REGULATION OR LEGISLATION THAT'S WHY WE HAVE OUR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF VERY FEW LEE GENERATORS THAT DOES HOLD THOSE LICENSES. WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE CLEAR ON THE DISTINCTION BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IT WILL LENDING TREE IS A LEAD GENERATOR. IT OPERATES DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY WE OPERATE. BUT CONSUMERS DO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION THEY NEED TO KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE. THAT BROKER IS ADVOCATING FOR THEM IF THEY'RE WORKING WITH A LEAD GENERATOR. THIS IS A MARKETPLACE WHERE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONNECTED WITH THE LENDER THAT YOU WANT. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN HOW LEE GENERATORS AND BROKERS ARE TRADITIONALLY COMPENSATED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT THEY MAKE SO OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT TO THE CONCEPT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS NECESSARY. OUR OPPOSITION IS JUST TO SAY RESPECT THE DIFFERENCES AND LET'S MAKE SURE. WE DON'T. MAKE THE DEFINITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH THE BROKER LANGUAGE NOW WORSE LET'S JUST SPLIT THE TWO AND SAID THIS IS WHAT WE GENERATIONS THIS IS WHAT BROKERING AS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT. THE OBLIGATIONS AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY THEY'RE SENIOR DISTRICT TRYING TO. ANDY GENERATORS. TO BE LICENSED AND. BROKERS CORRECT. OKAY SO THAT. WOULD PROTECT THE CONSUMERS MORE. IT IT ONLY PROTECTS CONSUMERS MORE IF THE LEAD GENERATION COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA SAYS YES WE UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO BE LICENSED AND WERE WILLING TO DO IT. BECAUSE IF THE LEAD GENERATORS PULL OUT THEY IF THEY SAY WE'RE NOT BROKERS. AND THEY EITHER DON'T PARTICIPATE OR THE EXIT THE MARKET THEN CONSUMERS WILL BE EXPOSED TO THE BADLY GENERATORS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT. THE MORE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE LICENSED. IN THIS INDUSTRY THE MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION WE HAVE BUT WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH THEM OUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT. IT DOESN'T FIT THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS YES SINCE YOU. ASSUME PROTECTOR LEAD GENERATOR SO. THE LENDERS. ARM. THE DAILY ADVERTISER THEIR OWN PRODUCT AGO WAS FARGO BANK AMERICA WHATEVER MIGHT. A. BOTH. BY USING YOU. AND MY NOT PAYING MORE PICASA. THEY WOULD PAY YOU. MELISSA I. GO INTO OUR IN A CONTRACT WITH THAT MIGHT THAT THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. THAT WE ARE A PART OF A LENDERS MARKETING BUDGET AND NINE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE TIME WE ACTUALLY HELP LENDERS REDUCE THEIR MARKETING EXPENSE. SO THE BOTTOM THE BOTTOM LINE IS COST OF ACQUISITION FOR A NEW CUSTOMER. YOU'RE GONNA PAY TO BRING THAT CUSTOMER IN IF YOU DO YOUR OWN MARKETING YOU CAN PAY BRING THAT CUSTOMER AND IF YOU USE A LEAD GENERATOR. THE ONLY REASON WE EXIST THE ONLY REASON PEOPLE DO BUSINESS WITH US IS BECAUSE WE USUALLY ALMOST ALWAYS LOWER THEIR COST OF ACQUISITION. BECAUSE OF. WE KNOW MARKETING THEY KNOW LENDING. SO WE SPECIALIZE IN WHAT WE DO THEY SPECIALIZE IN WHAT THEY DO SO THEY ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY USING US BUT THEY DO NOT EVER NOR DO WE. PASS THAT COST DIRECTLY ON TO THE CONSUMER WE NEVER CHARGE THE CONSUMER AND YOU WILL NEVER SEE. A LINE ITEM FOR LEAD GENERATION LIKE YOU MIGHT SEE A BROKER'S FEES. I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT THAT I I WAS A SHOPPING FOR MY YET NOW AIRLINE TICKET. IF YOU GO TO THE AIRLINE ITSELF. THIS OF COURSE IS MORE. BUT BUT THE LIKE US SOME OF THE CAR THEIR CORE EXPEDIA THAT SUPER HIM AND I WENT. AND THEIR VILLAGES SO SO I THINK THAT'S A LEAD TO GENERATE YEAH I. I I SEE OKAY MAYBE YOU ONE MORE QUESTION NOW. WHAT KIND OF A CONSUMER PROTECTION DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER THE CURRENT LAW SO FOR THE? IT GOOD TO THE GENEROUS AND THE BAD. THE GENEROUS A HOW CAN WE. DISCOURAGED BY BAD THE GENERATOR SAID NOT TO ACT AS SUCH. YOU KNOW. AT. IT'S JUST JUST LIKE ALMOST A CHEATED INTO THAT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW. WHO ARE SAID DID WITHOUT I THOUGHT ALSO DEALING WITH THE LENDER? SO AND THEN AND THE DIGGING INTO MY PERSONAL INFORMATION. I HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE WITH MY PERSONAL INFORMATION? THE THE. THE GOOD NEWS FOR THAT POINT IS THE FEDERAL REGULATORS BOTH THE FTC AND THE CFPB USE THERE YOU TAP AUTHORITY WHICH PROHIBITS UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES. THEY HAVE. SHOULD SHUT DOWN OR PENALIZED SOME WE GENERATORS FOR MAKING MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR MARKETING. CALIFORNIA HAS BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH SIMILARLY PROHIBITS ON UNTRUTHFUL MARKETING. I HAVE AND THE. FINANCE CODES TEAM. SIXTY ONE TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE ALSO PROHIBITS DECEPTIVE MARKETING SO THERE ARE STATUTES ON THE BOOKS THAT CAN BE USED RIGHT NOW TO RAIN AND THE BADLY GENERATORS. AND FROM ME YORK CURRENTLY ASSESSING THAT THE CURRENT LAWS ARE REGULATING DEGENERES. CURRENT LAWS ARE THERE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING USED AND THAT'S NOT ON A CD SO THERE ARE LAWS THERE BUT THERE IS NOT A REGULATOR FOR IT. THIS WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OR A CITY ATTORNEY OR COUNTY ATTORNEY THAT WOULD HAVE TO BRING. A. VIOLATIONS UNDER. FINANCIAL CODE SIXTEEN ONE TWENTY ONE OR THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE OR YOU CAN HAVE A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION. WHICH WE SUPPORT THEY SHOULD BE. UTILIZED IF THERE'S A WAY TO BRING THE DDO. INTO THE ENFORCEMENT PICTURE THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT AGAIN WE WANT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION WE JUST WANTED TO FIND. WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO DIFFRACTED EASE THAT'S ALL I'M WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER COMPROMISED TO COME UP WITH BETTER OVER WORKING TOGETHER YEAH NO WERE ABSOLUTELY WORKING TOGETHER I MEAN AND I THINK AS MR. I'M ROMMEL JUST MENTIONED IT'S LIKE IT'S NEW SPACE RIGHT IT'S COMPLICATED SO IT'S HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHAT THE NEW SPACE LOOKS LIKE WHAT THE ONLINE WORLD AYE LOOKS LIKE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WHAT'S IN STATUTE? DOES DEFINE WHAT THE WORLD OF OF LENDING ONLINE AND BUT THAT ALSO DISTINGUISHES ON WHAT A MARKETING PRACTICES VERSUS A BROKER PRACTICE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ON THAT IN THE SPAMMING YOU YOU YOU QUITE HONESTLY GAVE AN EXAMPLE TO. WHY THIS IS NEEDED KANKAN COUNSELOR DID YOU MAKE ANY PROPOSED SOURCE OF TO AMEND THE HER BILL? YES WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE CHAIRWOMAN AND HER STAFF VERY CLOSELY WE HAVE WORKED ON SOME ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE HIS EACH ISSUE EXCEPT YOU AMENDMENTS IT I THINK IN THE IN THE COMMITTEES. IN THE ANALYSIS FROM FROM THE STAFF THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DON'T QUITE FIT TOGETHER THINK THE FIRST ONE IS TO. CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF BROKER TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR. AND THE LAST ONE I BELIEVE IT'S POINT NUMBER NINE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO SPLIT THE DEFINITIONS. SO THEY KIND OF ARE ARE LOOKING AT BOTH OPTION THIS AND I THINK SPLITTING THE DEFINITIONS IS THE BETTER WAY TO IT TO PROCEED. S. USE IS NOT THERE YET IT'S NOT THERE YET. MISS BURKE. NO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND SO ARE ARE WE WORKING TOWARDS A DEFINITION FOR LEAD GENERATION GENERATOR SEPARATE FROM A BROKER OR. WHERE ARE WE PLANNING I JUST WANNA GET IDEA WERE PLAYING ONLINE BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS I MEAN? I AM A BROKER SO I A LEAD GENERATOR IS IS JUST ESSENTIALLY AN ADVERTISER AND I REALIZED ERA IT ACCESS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND I WANT THAT PROTECTED JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND. HOWEVER EIGHT I AM CURIOUS ARE WE MOVING TOWARDS A SEPARATE DEFINITION FOR A LEAD GENERATOR AND A SEPARATE DEFINITION FOR A BROKER AND IS THAT PLANNING ON BEING A DIFFERENT KIND OF LICENSE. UNDER A BROKER'S LICENSE OR WHAT IS THAT AND WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE ANGLE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH DB O. TO ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THIS I THINK THAT THERE IS A SPACE TO LOOK AT THESE AS DIFFERENT THINGS BUT I WOULD SAY JUST WHAT. YOU KNOW BACK TO WHAT WAS SPENT WITH BEEN DISCUSSED IS THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT DIFFERENT IN PRACTICE I MEAN ONE YOU KNOW GIVING OUT A LOT OF THE GENERAL CAN'T ABOUT. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DEFINE THESE IN A WAY AND THAT I YOU KNOW. ESSENTIALLY CFL LENDERS WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW LICENSED BROKER AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE THE BILL WITH THE. AB I AM I AM BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE FRIGHT BECAUSE I BEFORE I. BECAUSE I WAS LEANING TOWARDS NOT VOTING BUT IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS. THE ACTUAL DEFINITION THAT SEPARATE FOR A LEAD GENERATOR THAT'S A THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY REGULATING THEM IS IS FAIR AND NECESSARY ON BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY'RE. HAVE ACCESS TO SOME JUST DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT IS. IS THE GOAL TO HAVE. S. SEPARATE KIND OF. DEFINITION OF THEM UNDER A BROKER'S LIFE LIKE UNDER A BROKER'S LICENSE OR WILL THEY STILL IN YOUR PURVIEW BE LICENSE AS A PROCREATING THOUGH THEY'RE NOT DOING BROKER ACTIVITIES. RIGHT SO WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS A BETTER DEFINITION OF BOTH BUT WE ARE ALSO WAITING FOR THE OPPOSITION TO CARVE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. MISTER CALDERON. BOB MONTH THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THE TESTIMONY IN FOR THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS BILL. YOU KNOW. LEE GENERATOR GOING GOOGLE I NEED OF SMALL LOAN LATIMES FIRST THING THAT POPS UP AS A LEAD GENERATOR LA TIMES IN OF THE STATE. BEST LOAN. YOU KNOW IT IT AND SO I I THINK WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO DO IS TO IDENTIFY A REGULATORY BODY THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE THAT IT LEAVES OUT WITHOUT ONE IT LEADS TO POTENTIAL OR. THE MORE. PREVALENCE OF UNSCRUPULOUS WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK BUSINESS TO OUR OUTSIDE DIFFERENT LENDERS THROUGH THE LEAD GENERATOR. AND. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE'S INFORMATION AND IS PROTECTED ESPECIALLY. ARE IMPORTANT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE AS A STATE WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHO IS. OPERATING AS A LEAD GENERATOR AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE. THERE THE SERVICING WHOEVER AND THEY'RE BEING PAID BY. ARE AND AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON YOUR RAN. I'D MADAM CHAIR ON THE DEFINITION. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO SAY WE WILL. A DEFINITION OF A BROKER YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST. A POSSIBLE DEAL FOR WOULD BE YOUR CLIENT IS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE INDIVIDUAL. BUT I THINK. THE THE PIECE IN THIS BILL ALONE ABOUT ESTABLISHING. A REGULATORY AGENCY IS I BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE I THINK DEFINITIONS ARE REALLY A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN SOLVE DEFINITION BY ADDING A COM OR PERIOD. AT OUT YOU KNOW SEVEN SOME MY BILL SO. YOU KNOW OR MAYBE A ADDING AN AND OR OR SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A THAT'S A HARD HURDLE TO OVERCOME SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE. ABOUT WE HAVE TO AS A STATE TO SALVAGE A REGULATORY BODY TO OVERSEE THIS AND TO MANAGE IT SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE DEFINITIONAL. ISSUES HERE UP BUT THEN ALSO ENCOURAGE THE OPPOSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VALUE AND THE STATE INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING A STATE AGENCY TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY. AND HOW BY VERIFIED BUSINESSES LIKE YOURSELF YOU KNOW MAYBE CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE YOU GET THE PATH AT A VERIFIED CHECKING VERIFIED. YOU KNOW WORD ON YOUR WEBSITE TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING DUPED BY. OTHERS BAD ACTORS. YOU NOW YEAH YOU MAY FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AYE THAT CERTAIN THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND ARE NO WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THEY ARE OPERATING WITH A LICENSED. BUSINESS WITH THE STATE THAT HAS ARE ACTING IN IN IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT. JUST ALONE TO ESTABLISH. A REGULATORY AGENCY SO. I AM GONNA BE VOTING FOR THE BILL I MOVE THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN BEEN MOVED AND ENCOURAGES SECONDS AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THE BILL HAS BEEN REVISED CALDERON. MADAM CHAIR DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION I TRULY APPRECIATE A YOU BRING THIS BILL THWARTED YOU'D THINK THAT THE. DEFINITION OF BROKERS WHO IS OVERLY BROAD. BUT IN TERMS OF READING THIS BILL IT DOES ALSO SEEMED THAT. UNDER THIS CURRENT LANGUAGE THAT LEGIONARIES STILL BE CLASSIFIED UNDER BROKERS BUT IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THERE IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE BOTH DIFFERENT. OPPOSITIONS IF YOU WILL. BUT THAT IS THE CASE. WHY ISN'T THERE A SUPPER DEFINITION FOR BOTH AND IF IT'S GOING TO BE A SEPARATE DEFINITION? WILL IT BE SOMETHING UP REQUIRED TO BE A CHANGE IN THE STATUTE. WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON ACTUALLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ON WHAT THAT BROKER DEFINITION IS NOW AND WHAT A SEPARATE DEFINITION WOULD LOOK LIKE. ON IT'S ACTUALLY NO I MEAN IT'S NOT AS EASY AS. COME UP WITH WORDS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IT'S REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE PRACTICE THAT GOES BEHIND AS I AM TO COME UP TOGETHER SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN. A MUCH MORE THOROUGH IN DEPTH CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IT WE CAN COME UP WITH DEFINITIONS JUST YOU KNOW BY. LOOKING AT THE IN AND IN DICTIONARY WITH THESE THINGS MEAN BUT IT'S REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PRACTICE HAS BECOME NOW AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU HEARD BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPOSITION SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND TO COME UP WITH A DEFINITION NOT JUST THAT DEFINES IT BUT THAT MATCHES WHAT IS HAPPENING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANNOUNCING NON. THERE'S MISTER. DOCTOR CHOI. NOT BASED UPON YOUR YOUR EXPLANATION IF YOU AGREE UPON DEFINITION WHAT THE DEGENERATE WHICH GENERATORS ARE. WHAT BROKERS ARE WHAT I HEARD IN THE BEGINNING WESTERN? BROKERS SELL OUT WILL YOU DO OR THE TRANSACTION DETEST FOLLOW UP. THE GENERATOR'S ONLY INTRODUCING. SO AS WRONG ANSWER DEGENERATE RA SAID TO THE A JOB BUT NOT TO THE POOL WORRYING THEN WE MAY NOT NEED THAT THOUGH. OVERSIGHT. THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. MIGHT. AYE AYE WITHIN FAIRNESS TO CONSUMERS AND WITH RESPECT EVERYTHING THAT THAT HAS BEEN SAID IN THE COMMITTEE HERE WE SEE THERE STILL SHOULD BE SOME OVERSIGHT OVERTLY GENERATORS. BECAUSE ADAM PART OF THE SCENARIO DOCTOR CHOI IS THAT. LEE GENERATORS MAKE AN INTRODUCTION AND IT'S USUALLY LEFT BETWEEN. THE POTENTIAL BORROWER AND THE LENDER THERE'S NOT USUALLY A BROKER INVOLVED AS WELL AS A LEAD GENERATOR IN THE IN THE SMALL DARK CONSUMER SPACE PARTICULARLY. SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THE LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY THERE THAT PROHIBIT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE MISLEADING ADVERTISING HAT DOES NEED TO BE ENFORCED AND AND WE FULLY. SUPPORT ENFORCING THAT. SO THERE SHOULD BE SOME ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM FOR THAT AND WE AGREE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. AS SOON KNOW MADAM CHAIR WAS LIKE CLOTHES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RENOVO. AND IT'S BEEN. MOOD BY MISTER CALDERON SECONDED BY MISTER STONE. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB THIRTY TILL SEVEN. ON APPROPRIATIONS LIMON AYE LAMONT AYE CHEN. CHEN NOT VOTING ACOSTA. ACOSTA NO BURKE.
