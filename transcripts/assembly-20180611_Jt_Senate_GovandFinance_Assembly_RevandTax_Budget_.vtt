BELIEVE THE BALLOT MEASURE IS

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:25.116
VERY LAUDABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:27.218
IT WOULD LIKE TO DO. I DO HAVE.

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:29.487
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT FEARS THAT

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.322
HE WOULD CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.191
THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.058
THAT WE HAVE.

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:36.461
SURE IN THE STATE THAT HE WOULD

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:39.530
DIE CONTINUE TO. COME. CONTINUE

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:41.733
TO RESTRICT OUR HOUSING SUPPLY

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:43.801
DOES NOT HELP US WITH OUR HOUSE

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:44.435
IS A PLEASURE TO KNOW NUMBER US

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:45.336
HAVE.

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:45.970
BEEN CHAMPING UP AND DOWN THE

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:46.704
STATE AND.

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.806
IT WOULD ALSO A POTENTIALLY

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:50.375
HAVE REVENUE IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.509
OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR EDUCATIONAL

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.778
SYSTEM SO I VERY MUCH CHAU

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:54.979
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.247
DIALOGUE TODAY I THINK THIS IS

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:58.016
EXACTLY WHAT THE. PEOPLE AT HOPE

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.350
WE WOULD HAVE IS THAT WE WOULD

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.552
HAVE A VERY ON NOW FORTHRIGHT.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.554
POLICY DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:03.988
BALLOT MEASURE THAT

00:32:04.055 --> 00:32:05.990
UNFORTUNATELY I GET DEBATED IN

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.625
THIRTY SECOND COMMERCIALS

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:11.562
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE CAMP.

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:13.164
WITH THAT WHILE WE HAVE A REVIEW

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:16.367
OF THE INITIATIVE MISTER YOU ARE.

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:31.582
WHICH ELECT BEGIN.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF

GRANULAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:35.953
ANALYST'S OFFICE BEFORE I GO

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.587
INTO MY PRESENTATION US MONEY A

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.189
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON OUR

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.524
OFFICES ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.658
PROCESS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:41.893
DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.861
ROLE AND SAY. THE BUDGET OR

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.830

00:32:47.398 --> 00:32:49.167
COMMENTS ON WHETHER OR NOT A

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.668
POLICY IS GOOD OR BAD.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.537
OUR ROLE IN THE INITIAL PROCESS

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:53.471
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.273
VOTERS HAVE PASSED US WITH BEING

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.141
AN IMPARTIAL OBJECTIVE THIRD

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.076
PARTY THAT.

00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:59.944
ASSESSES THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:01.546
A MEASURE BUT IN THAT ROLE WE

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:03.681
DON'T TAKE POSITIONS ON MEASURES

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:03.948
WE DON'T.

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:06.884
OFFER COMMENTARY ON THE MERITS

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.386
OF THE POLICY CHANGES.

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.220
WE.

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:11.823
FOCUS STRICTLY ON ESTIMATING

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.092
THE MEASURES FISCAL FAX.

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:15.193
WITHOUT A MIND.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.627
OF A PREPARE TO HAND OUT FOR

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:17.995
TODAY'S PRESENTATION I HOPE YOU

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:19.664
ALL HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.733
AND AND ALSO WITH A LITTLE BIT

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.701
OF BACKGROUND JUST ON

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:24.769
CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.237
THE PROPERTY TAXES THE SINGLE

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.038
LARGEST.

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.272
TAX REVENUE SOURCE FOR LOW

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.607
GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.775
SCHOOL CITIES COUNTIES AND

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.910
SPECIAL DISTRICTS.

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.479
AND IT RAISES OVER SIXTY BILLION

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:37.315
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR INDIVIDUAL

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:38.883
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.152
THEIR TAX BILL IS EQUAL TO THEIR

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:42.620
TAX RATE TIMES THEIR TAX WILL

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.389
VALUE OR WHAT'S COMMONLY

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:45.690
REFERRED TO THE ASSESSED VALUE.

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:47.592
THE TYPICAL TAX RATE IS ONE

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.827
POINT ONE PERCENT I'M TAXES THE

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.662
TAX WILL VALUE IS BASED ON THE

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:52.930
PURCHASE PRICE OF A HOME.

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:53.731
AND.

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.166
YEAR THE HOMES PURCHASED IT

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.701
SAID IT'S PURCHASE PRICE AND

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:58.002
THEN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER IT'S

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:00.872
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION BY UP TO

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:01.973
TWO PERCENT A YEAR.

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.908
UNDER THIS SYSTEM MOST HOMES ARE

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.910
TAXED AT A VALUE THAT IS WELL

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.545
BELOW THEIR MARKET VALUE IN THIS

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:09.547
IS BECAUSE. THE MARKET VALUE OF

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:12.817
MOST HOMES GROWS A FASTER THAN

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:14.685
TWO PERCENT IN MOST YEARS.

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:16.220
AND THIS RESULTS IN A

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:17.355
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAXABLE

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.790
VALUE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF A

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:20.291
HOME.

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.993
AND BECAUSE OF THIS NGUYEN MANY

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.461
EXISTING HOME BUYERS LOOK TO

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.029
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT HOME. THEY

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:26.397
OFTEN ARE FACED WITH.

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:27.932
THE POSSIBILITY OF PAYING

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.600
HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES IN THAT

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:31.135
NEW HOME AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.370
EXISTING HOME THEY'RE PAYING

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:33.471
TAXES BASED ON.

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.206
TAXABLE VALUE THAT'S BELOW

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.241
CURRENT MARKET VALUES WHEN THEY

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:38.543
BUY THE NEW HOME IT WILL BE

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:39.777
ASSESSED AT ITS PURCHASE PRICE

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:41.446
WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF THE

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.214
CURRENT MARKET VALUES. AND

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.549
THERE'S SOME RESEARCH BY THAT'S

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:45.783
BEEN TO MY OUR OFFICE AND

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:46.918
ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS THAT

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.653
SUGGESTS THAT THIS THE

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.954
POSSIBILITY OF THIS INCREASE.

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:51.389
AND PROPERTY TAXES CAN

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.691
DISCOURAGE SOME PEOPLE OF FROM

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.759
SELLING THEIR HOME AND BUYING

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.027
ANOTHER ONE WHEN THEY MAY

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.428
OTHERWISE FIND IT AND IT

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:59.630
ADVANTAGEOUS TO DO SO.

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:02.533
IMPARTIALLY WITH THAT IN MIND.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.502
PASSED INITIATIVES HAVE CREATED

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:07.438
SOME SPECIAL RULES ALLOW CERTAIN

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:07.738
HOMEOWNERS.

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.040
TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT HOME

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:10.808
WHILE KEEPING THE PROPERTY TAX

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:12.410
BILL FOR THE EXISTING HOME.

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:13.744
AND TO QUALIFY FOR THESE RULES

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:15.446
THE THE NEW HOME HAS TO BE OF

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:17.215
EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. OF THE

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.583
HOMEOWNER HAS TO BE OVER FIFTY

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.518
FIVE OR SEVERELY DISABLED OR OWN

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:22.220
A PROPERTY THAT WAS AFFECTED BY

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.354
A NATURAL DISASTER OR

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:24.722
CONTAMINATION.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.057
THEY'VE US MOVING WITHIN THE

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.392
COUNTY OR TO A SELECT NUMBER OF

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.994
OTHER COUNTIES WHERE THE BOARD

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.762
OF SUPERVISORS HAS TAKEN A VOTE

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.531
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.233
AND ALLOW SOMEONE TO MOVE ACROSS

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.501
COUNTY LINES AND BRING THEIR

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.969
PROPERTY TAX BILL WITH THEM.

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:39.570
AND GENERALLY THESE RULES CAN

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.238
ONLY BE USED.

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:41.138
ONCE

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:44.909
AND A LIFETIME.

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.944
OF THIS MEASURE WOULD EXPAND OF

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.646
THESE US MARSHALS ALLOW THE

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:49.981
SERRANO TO HOMEOWNERS I JUST

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.649
MENTION TO TAKE THEIR PROPERTY

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.017
TAX BILL WITH THEM TO A

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:54.285
DIFFERENT HOME.

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.887
IT WOULD EXPAND INFORMING WAYS

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:57.221
FIRST IT WOULD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:58.756
TO MOVE. ANYWHERE WITHIN THE

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.324
STATE.

00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:02.226
INCLUDING TO COUNTIES WHERE THE

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.128
BOARD SUPERVISORS HAS NOT TAKEN

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:04.729
THE VOTE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:06.097
PROGRAM.

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:08.533
IT ALLOWS THE A TAX BILL TO BE

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.401
TRANSFERRED TO A MORE EXPENSIVE

00:36:10.468 --> 00:36:11.769
HOME WHERE IS RIGHT NOW HAS TO

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.504
BE HOME OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE.

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.906
IT.

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.607
IN IT.

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.342
ALSO REDUCES THE TAXES THAT

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.511
WOULD BE PAID FOR A HOME A NEWLY

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:22.380
PURCHASED HOME THAT IS. OF

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:23.881
LESSER VALUE.

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:25.416
THAN THE EXISTING HOMEOWNER

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:27.351
CURRENT LAW WIN A HOMEOWNER BUYS

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:28.853
A NEW HOME THAT IS LESS

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.021
EXPENSIVE THEIR PROPERTY TAX

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.822
BILL STAYS THE SAME. UNDER THIS

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.190
MEASURE THEIR TAX BILL WOULD

00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:34.659
ACTUALLY GO DOWN.

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:37.061
AND FINALLY OF THE MEASURE WOULD

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:38.529
A REMOVED THE LIMIT ON THE

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.897
NUMBER OF TIMES IN A LIFETIME

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.065
HOMEOWNER THE HOMEOWNER CAN TAKE

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.700
ADVANTAGE.

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:43.467
OF THE.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:46.871
THESE RULES.

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:49.173
ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT I

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.741
WALK THROUGH AN EXAMPLETO GIVE

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.710
AN IDEA ABOUT HOW THESE RULES

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.878
WOULD WORK.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.580
STARTING WITH A A HYPOTHETICAL

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:57.381
FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD COUPLE WHO

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:59.116
OWNS A HOME.

00:36:59.183 --> 00:37:00.151
WITH THE TAXABLE VALUE OF TWO

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:02.019
HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A MARKET

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:03.888
VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.189
DEPARTMENT TAX RATE OF ONE

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.791
POINT ONE PERCENT.

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.693
OTHER TAX BILL IS TWENTY TWO

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.294
HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.729
AND THIS COUPLES COUPLE IS

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.064
CONSIDERING MOVING TO ONE OF TWO

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.966
HOUSES A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:15.533
THAT IS WHERE SEVEN HUNDRED

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.868
THOUSAND. OR LESS EXPENSIVE HOME

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.403
IT'S WORTH FOREIGN FIFTY

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.905
THOUSAND UNDER CURRENT LAW.

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:21.906
MOVING TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:23.274
HOME THAT HOME.

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.542
BECAUSE IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:25.476
THAN THEIR EXISTING HOME IT

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.611
WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THE

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.746
EXISTING RULES AND THEREFORE

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.114
WOULD BE TAXES PURCHASE PRICE

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:32.116
RESULTING. IN THE INCREASE IN

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.085
THEIR TAX BILL TWO SEVENTY SEVEN

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.620
HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:37.021
OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE HOME WOULD

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.090
CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR THE RULES

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.291
AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD KEEP

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:42.059
THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL AT

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:42.627
TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:44.495
YEAR.

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:47.231
NOW TURNING TO PAGE FOUR. WE SEE

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:48.232
HOW THIS WOULD CHANGE UNDER THE

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.201
PROPOSED MEASURE.

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.702
WITH THE MORE EXPENSIVE HOME

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.371
THEIR TAX BILL WOULD INCREASE

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.772
SOMEWHAT FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.307
TO THIRTY THREE HUNDRED. BUT

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.608
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT IN

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:58.776
THE CURRENT LAW WORK GOES TO

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.411
SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.979
YEAR. AND THIS THIRTY THREE

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.014
HUNDRED DOLLAR.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.882
ANNUAL TAX BILL A REFLECTS A

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.584
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:07.952
TAXABLE VALUE.

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:10.254
WHICH IS THE THE PRODUCT OF

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:12.323
THIS FORMULA YOU SEE. HERE UNDER

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.524
THE FIRST BULLET WHICH IS.

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.526
AS OUTLINED IN THE MEASURE YOU

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:16.694
WOULD TAKE THE PRIOR HOMES TAX

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:18.696
WILL VALUE. AND ADD TO IT THE

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:29.707
DIFFERENCE IN MARKET VALUES

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:30.174
BETWEEN THE NEW HOME.

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:30.608
AND THE PRIOR HOME.

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:31.342
A SECOND WILL YOU CAN SEE THAT.

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:32.009
THERE FOR IN BUYING THE LESS

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.045
EXPENSIVE HOME UNDER THE MEASURE

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:34.712
THE HOMEOWNERS TAX BILL WOULD GO

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:35.379
DOWN FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. TO

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:36.147
ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.448
FIFTY IN THIS WOULD.

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:38.849
BASED ON A TAX WILL VALUE OF A

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:40.718
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND.

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.787
WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE SECOND

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.255
FORMALLY HERE ON PAGE FOUR.

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.323
WHICH IS GENERALLY TAKING THE

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.192
PRIOR HOME SEXUAL VALUE. AND

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.394
MULTIPLYING THAT BY THE RATIO OF

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.196
THE NEW HOMES MARKET VALUE.

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:53.464
DIVIDED BY THE OLD HOMES MARKET

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:58.502
VALUE.

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:00.071
AND THEN FINALLY TURN TO PAGE

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:02.339
FIVE IS A SUMMARY OF OUR.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.674
ESTIMATE OF THE MEASURES FISCAL

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.076
FAX

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:05.743
I'M BEFORE GOING INTO THE

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.745
DETAILS I JUST WANTED TO MENTION

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:08.646
THAT.

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.848
WE ARE STILL FINALIZING THE

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.583
ESTIMATES THAT WILL APPEAR IN

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.551
THE VOTER GUIDE IN THE VOTING

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.852
MATERIALS FOR NOVEMBER THE

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.020
NUMBERS THAT ARE REFLECTED HERE

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.688
ARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:18.989
WE UNDERTOOK IN THE FALL FOR THE

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.191
TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGE IN

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:20.991
NUMBERS THAT WENT OUT AS PART OF

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.393
THE. PETITIONS THAT WERE

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:22.860
PRESENTED TO VOTERS.

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:24.762
.

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.031
SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE FIND

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.332
THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FISCAL

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.433
AFFECT OF THE MEASURE IS A

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.334
REDUCTION IN PROPERTY TAX

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.535
REVENUES.

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.504
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:35.906
IN THE FIRST YEARS WE ESTIMATE

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.274
THAT SCHOOLS AND OTHER LOCAL

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:38.776
GOVERNMENTS WOULD EACH

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:41.212
LOSE A OVER A HUNDRED MILLION

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:43.047
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:45.516
AND THAT THESE LOSSES WOULD GROW

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:46.550
OVER TIME.

00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:48.252
I'LL PROBABLY REACHING AROUND A

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:49.153
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.555
A YEAR.

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:54.158
THESE LOSSES ARE THE THE NET

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.192
EFFECT OF A COUPLE OF MOVING

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:56.627
PIECES.

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.829
ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.465
YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:04.101
OF HOMEBUYERS EACH YEAR ARE MADE

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.302
UP BY THOSE WHO ARE OVER FIFTY

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:07.037
FIVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. A

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.272
QUARTER AND A THIRD OF HOME

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.040
BUYERS IN RECENT YEARS ARE OVER

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.909
FIFTY FIVE. AND THAT MEANS THERE

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:14.078
ARE SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.746
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.782
HOMEBUYERS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.483
ELIGIBLE FOR A TAX BREAK UNDER

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.918
THIS INITIATIVE.

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:24.021
AND ONLY A MINORITY OF THOSE

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.023
HOME BUYERS ARE RECEIVING. A TAX

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.391
BREAK UNDER THE CURRENT RULES SO

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.425
THAT MEANS WE GET SICK A

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:30.227
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION.

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:30.528
OF.

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.396
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:33.230
FOR THAT TAX BREAK WHICH WOULD

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:34.932
MEAN THEY BE PAYING LESS

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:36.267
PROPERTY TAXES WHICH MAY IN TURN

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.668
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD RECEIVE

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.069
LESS REVENUE.

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.171
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.206
.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.641
THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:45.242
EVIDENCE THAT WHEN HOMEOWNERS

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:47.178
RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.680
THAT CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE

00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:51.215
AND HOME PRICES IN THERE'S A FEW

00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.249
REASONS FOR THIS BUT JUST IN

00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.684
GENERAL. IF YOU THINK.

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.919
IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HOME BUYER

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:56.487
THEY HAVE A CERTAIN BUDGET THAT

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.054
THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR A

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.589
HOUSE.

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:00.691
AND THAT INCLUDES IN THAT

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:01.826
BUDGET IS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:02.927
SET ASIDE EACH YEAR FOR THEIR

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:04.595
ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT. IF

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:05.462
THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.765
FOR PROPERTY TAXES GOES DOWN.

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.667
THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM WILLING TO

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:11.035
PAY LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:12.336
THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE OR IT

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:13.938
COULD TAKE SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:15.239
MARGIN OF BEING A HOME BUYER.

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.707
MAYBE THEY CAN'T QUITE AFFORD IT

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:17.842
IF THE PROPERTY TAXES COME DOWN

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.510
A LITTLE BIT THAN PURCHASING

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.678
THAT HOUSE MAY FALL INTO THEIR

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:21.579
BUDGET SO IT COULD.

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:24.348
ENCOURAGE MORE HOME BUYERS.

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.749
TO BUY HOMES.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.451
THERE'S BEEN SOME RESEARCH

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.720
TRYING TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:31.956
PROJECT SAVINGS ON HOME PRICES.

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:34.191
ONE STUDY TRYING TO LOOK AT THE

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.926
EFFECT OF THE SAVINGS A PROP

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:36.493
THIRTEEN IN GENERAL SUGGESTS

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.262
THAT.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.264
EACH DOLLAR PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.433
RELATES TO SEVEN DOLLAR INCREASE

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:44.001
IN AGGREGATE PROPERTY VALUES AND

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:44.702
THAT.

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.403
TRANSLATES INTO SEVEN CENTS

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.172
MORE PROPERTY TAXES SO FOR EACH

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.241
DOLLAR OF PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:50.808
OR FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:52.610
PERSPECTIVE. A PROPERTY TAX

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.144
REVENUE REDUCTION A YOU MIGHT

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.179
HAVE AN OFFSETTING AFFECT

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:56.146
SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.815
SEVEN CENTS OF OF AN OFFSETTING

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.516
INCREASE FROM THIS HOME PRICE

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:00.718
AFFECT.

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:01.952
ALSO SOME OFFSETTING EFFECT BUT

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:03.687
STILL SMALL RELATIVE TO THE TO

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.756
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LOSSES.

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:08.525
AND THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:09.960
A PROPERTY TAXES DIRECTLY BUT

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.228
THE STATE'S BUDGET WOULD BE.

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:14.531
IMPACTED BY THIS MEASURE. OF

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.400
BECAUSE STATE LAW GUARANTEES

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:17.835
SCHOOLS A CERTAIN LEVEL FUNDING

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:19.303
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STATE

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.339
GENERAL FUND IN PROPERTY TAXES.

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.140
AND.

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.376
WIN PROPERTY TAXES FOR SCHOOLS

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:26.477
GO DOWN.

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:28.612
THEN THAT MEANS THAT STAGE

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.314
OFTEN ALLOCATIONS OF SCHOOLS

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.782
HAVE TO GO UP TO MAKE UP. THE

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.250
DIFFERENCE.

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:34.485
AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY A FEW

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.920
OTHER SMALLER FISCAL EFFECTS

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:37.421
FROM THE MEASURE OF THE MEASURE

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.456
WOULD LIKELY RESULT AND.

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:41.191
SOME INCREASE IN PROPERTY

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:43.160
TRANSFER TAX REVENUES.

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.895
THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.131
FROM A PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.866
CAPITAL GAINS FROM HOME SALES.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:49.300
AND.

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:51.802
HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.370
COUNTY ASSESSORS ESPECIALLY.

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.306
AND THIS THIS COULD BE IS

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.007
ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THE

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.976
SHORT TERM AS COUNTY ASSESSORS

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:00.411
TRIED TO KIND OF ESTABLISH THE

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:00.744
MAKE.

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.178
OKAY.

00:44:41.245 --> 00:44:43.180
BECAUSE THEY CONTROL FIFTY SIX

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.650
PERCENT OF THE WEALTH.

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:47.584

THANK YOU I I TO THE QUESTION

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.195
UNDER REDUCE PROPERTY TAX

00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:00.931
REVENUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DATA

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:02.933
AGGREGATED AMOUNT.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.069
WHILE CALL OF.

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.570
IT'S CORRECT OKAY BECAUSE I CAN

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:10.674
SEE SOME BENEFIT TO. OF. AREA OF

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.776
HIGHER CALLS THE REAL ESTATE

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.645
MARKET.

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:17.214
THEN AND IF THE THAT GOAL OF

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:18.248
THEIR OLD.

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.184
HOUSE.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.985
YOU NO THAT AND DIDN'T NEW

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:26.023
BUYERS AND UP A MUCH HIGHER PROP.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:28.292
SO FOR THAT COUNTY.

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:29.493
DID IT PROBABLY WILL SEE IT

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.962
INCOME.

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.330
BUT IF THE DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.467
FIRE MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY. AND

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.836
CARRIED THAT EXCEPTION WITH THEM.

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.704
SO DATA BUYING COUNTY MAY BE

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.440
LOSING SOME OF THE PROPERTY TAX.

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.375
BUT THE SELLING DID DID DID THE

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:47.511
COUNTY WHERE HE'D SOLD HIS

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:50.047
THIRTY YOUR OWN HOME.

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:51.748
PROBABLY WOULD IN JURY OF MUCH

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.650
HIGHER PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE A

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:56.153
NEW BUYER WILL HAVE TO PAY A

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.389
MUCH HIGHER PROPERTY TAX.

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.290
I THINK THAT'S.

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.792
THAT'S CORRECT IN CONCEPT I

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.227
THINK THOUGH YOU HAVE TO THINK

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.828
ABOUT KIND OF BOTH SIDES OF THE

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:05.762
TRANSACTION THE YOU WERE

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.197
MENTIONING THAT.

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.032
THIS BUYER WILL SELL THEIR

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:11.335
HOUSE RIGHT AND THAT WILL RESULT

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:13.103
IN AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.671
ASSESSMENT FOR THAT HOUSE BUT

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:15.506
THEN THEY'LL BE MOVING TO

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.507
ANOTHER HOUSE AND THEY'LL BE

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:17.341
TAKING THEIR ASSESSMENT WITH

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.209
THEM AND THAT WILL BE

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:21.945
ESSENTIALLY A A A REDUCTION IN

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:23.380
THE ASSESSED VALUE IN THE.

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.915
ASSESSMENT INCREASE THAT WOULD

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:25.482
HAVE OTHERWISE OCCURRED IF

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:26.984
SOMEONE ELSE SAID AND PURCHASE

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.019
THAT HOUSE RIGHT BUT I I THINK

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.387
YOUR POINT STILL REMAINS THAT TO

00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:32.122
THE EXTENT. THAT IF THERE ARE

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.024
TWO COUNTIES WHERE YOU HAVE A

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.426
SIGNIFICANT FLOW OUT OF ONE

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:37.628
COUNTY INTO ANOTHER COUNTY

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:39.663
THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME THERE

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.198
COULD BE SOME DIFFERENTIAL

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:43.100
ACROSS THOSE COUNTIES IN TERMS

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:43.700
OF HOW THE FISCAL AFFECTS PLAY

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:44.768
OUT.

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:47.204
I THINK WE WERE LOOKING AT THE

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.172
DATA WE DIDN'T SEE THAT THERE

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.007
WERE A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:52.042
THERE WERE HUGE IMBALANCES

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.043
ACROSS COUNTIES IN TERMS OF

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.811
PEOPLE. YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:55.913
DISPROPORTION AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.548
LEAVING ONE COUNTING GOING TO

00:46:57.614 --> 00:46:58.815
ANOTHER PARTICULAR COUNTY.

00:46:58.882 --> 00:47:01.385
ENOUGH THAT THAT IT YOU KNOW

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.019
THAT THOSE FISCAL EFFECTS WOULD

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:04.321
VARY. GREATLY ACROSS COUNTY

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:04.555
LINES.

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:07.591
BUT I I THINK IN IN GENERAL.

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.793
THERE.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.761
THERE COULD BE SOME OF THOSE

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:11.762
KIND OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS ACROSS

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.463
COUNTIES YOU RIGHT.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.465
NO THANK YOU.

00:47:15.532 --> 00:47:17.234
I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING.

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.369
I I THINK I'M TO PIGGYBACK OFF

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.671
MY ARMY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.439
JOSE'S POINT I MEAN.

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.274
I I HAVE THE OPPOSITE CONCERN

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.009
THAT YOU HAVE AREAS THAT

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.811
CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:28.912
IN TERMS OF REAL ESTATE WHICH IS

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:30.714
COASTAL CALIFORNIA. OUT WHEN I

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:32.216
WAS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR SAN

00:47:32.282 --> 00:47:33.817
FRANCISCO I GOT NUMEROUS CALLS

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.385
ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING TO MOVE

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:38.388
INTO. SAN FRANCISCO THIS THIS

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.757
WOULD ALLOW IT IN ESSENCE ON

00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.492
SENIOR RESEARCHERS ARE VERY

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.560
WEALTHY.

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:45.796
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTEE UMP TO BE

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.030
ABLE TO COME INTO.

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:49.600
SAN FRANCISCO UNDERCUT THE

00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.034
COMPETITION WHICH WOULD BE

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:53.737
PEOPLE AT MY AGE I BOUGHT ARE

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:54.605
NOT THAT MUCH YOUNGER THAN

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.639
MISTER VOEPEL.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:56.607
BUT.

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.208
THAT PEOPLE ARE AT MY AGE LEVEL

00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:59.343
WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE HE

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:02.112
COULD ACTUALLY. PAY A HIGHER

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:04.047
PRICE BID A HIGHER PRICE BECAUSE

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:06.049
HE HAD A LOWER TAX BASE. IS SO

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:08.185
ARM DID THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:09.686
CONCERNING I THINK THIS WOULD BE.

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:11.455
THIS WHICH FURTHER EXACERBATE

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.790
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND IN THE

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.559
COAST COASTAL PART OF CALIFORNIA

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:17.661
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.930
INCREASE AT EXETER STORE.

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:21.265
ENCOURAGING NEXT IS I THINK

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.699
QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT WOULD MEAN

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:25.469
THAT PEOPLE WHO. AYE IN ESSENCE

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:27.170
COULD. FEEL LIKE THEY COULD

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:29.606
AFFORD COASTAL CALIFORNIA COLSON

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:32.042
MAYBE IT LOOK AT SANTA MONICA OR

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:34.911
LONG BEACH OR. YOU KNOW WEST LA.

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:38.682
IN ALL THIS AND FIND OUT MUCH

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.483
MORE ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE.

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:39.783
THEY COULD.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:40.450
TRANSFER THEIR NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:42.252
FIVE YEAR PROPERTY TAX.

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.421
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE ON

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:48.792
ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.961
YES THANK YOU COULD YOU JUST UP.

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:51.428
WALK THROUGH.

00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:53.597
ONE MORE TIME THE IMPACT ON A

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.431
SCHOOL FUNDING THAT'S ONE OF MY

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.566
MAIN CONCERNS.

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:57.200
BUT I I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:57.968
HERE IS THAT WE'RE. LIKELY

00:48:58.035 --> 00:48:59.936
REDUCE.

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:01.138
THE ABILITY TO FUND SCHOOLS ON

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:01.938
THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:03.173
EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.975
STATE WOULD BACK FILL. THOSE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.410
DOLLARS STARTING AT A HUNDRED

00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:08.578
MILLION AND THEN WRAPPING UP TO.

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:10.681
A BILLION AND THEN PROBABLY MORE.

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.716
LONGER TERM YES SO THAT'S TRUE

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.951
IN IN GENERAL SO IN GENERAL A

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.720
STATE LAW CURRENTLY DICTATES

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.188
THAT EACH SCHOOL RECEIVED A

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:19.990
CERTAIN MINIMUM LEVEL FUNDING.

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:21.325
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STATE

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:23.560
FUNDING AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:25.829
SO IT FOR MOST SCHOOLS OF THEIR

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.097
PROPERTY TAXES GO DOWN AS A

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.365
RESULT OF THIS MEASURE THEY WILL

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.966
BE ESSENTIALLY.

00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:31.501
MADE WHOLE WITH ADDITIONAL

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.003
STATE GENERAL FUND NOW A COUNTY

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.304
OUT TO THAT IS THERE ARE.

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.340
ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF SCHOOLS

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:37.908
THAT RECEIVE.

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.910
ENOUGH PROPERTY TAXES THAT IS

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:40.944
THAT ACTUALLY THE BASIC EIGHT

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.446
SCHOOLS THAT EXCEEDS THEIR

00:49:42.512 --> 00:49:43.880
MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND SO THEY

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.582
DON'T RECEIVE ANY STATE FUNDING

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:47.117
AT ALL OR THEY RECEIVE. A

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.952
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.654
AND SO.

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:52.756
PROPER TALKS LOSSES FOR THOSE

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:56.360
SCHOOLS WOULD BE WOULD HAVE A

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.228
THOSE SCHOOLS WITHOUT ANY

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.830
ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING.

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:00.897
SO SO TWO POINTS AND YOU WHEN

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.199
YOU SAY MADE WHOLE MONEY STILL

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:03.600
GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.935
SAMI'S YOU'RE NOT TAKING OUT A

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:06.002
LOCAL BUDGET YOUR THEN DIPPING

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:07.871
INTO THE STATE BUDGET AND THAT

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.306
WOULD GIVE SHRINK. POTENTIALLY

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:10.507
SHRINK THE DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.042
OTHER SERVICES.

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.944
WITH WITH THIS ULTIMATELY IN

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.379
THE LONG TERM.

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:16.680
SHOULD A SHRINK THE NUMBER OF

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:19.216
BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS.

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:19.883
IT.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.851
IT POTENTIALLY COULD.

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:24.321
.

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:25.222
IT'S SIMPLE TO SAY IT'S NOT

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.957
SOMETHING WE LOOKED AT IN DETAIL.

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:29.626
BUT THE I THINK IF THERE WERE

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:30.894
DISTRICTS THAT WERE.

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.729
ON THAT KIND OF ON THE MARGIN

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:34.131
OF BEING BASIC AID THAT THAT THE

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.399
EFFECT OF THIS MEASURE IN THE

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:38.034
LONG TERM COULD POTENTIALLY PUSH

00:50:38.101 --> 00:50:38.468
THEM BACK TO BEING.

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.504
.

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.738
NOT NOT BASIC INTO HIS I THINK

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:43.073
SOME DISTRICTS GO BASIC GAVE

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.441
THEM COME OUT THEY GO BACK AND.

00:50:44.508 --> 00:50:46.943
SO I THINK THIS IS MADE MAYBE

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.211
GET A FORCE FAR OUT.

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.980
OF BEING BASICALLY A DISTRICTS

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.748
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.349
POINT OF THE MONEY HAS TO COME

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.316
FROM SOMEWHERE.

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:55.118
OUR SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY IN A

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:55.986
RADICALLY UNDER FUNDED IN THE

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.921
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.589
WE'RE GONNA PUT GREATER BURDEN

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.991
ON THE STATE FROM THE LOCALS

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.125
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST FREE

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:03.627
MONEY IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:05.028
TO MEAN LESS DOLLARS FOR OTHER

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:06.797
SERVICES AND MAYBE EVEN

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:07.431
ULTIMATELY SCHOOLS THEMSELVES OF

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:11.802
THANK YOU.

00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:13.603
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.272
KIND OF GRAPPLING WITH WHAT

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.507
EXACTLY THE IMPACT ON TAX

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:19.943
REVENUES WOULD BE BECAUSE I KNOW.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:21.445
THAT YOU SAID IN THE SHORT TERM

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.679
WE CAN CALCULATE WHAT THOSE

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.314
WOULD BE BECAUSE WE CAN ESTIMATE

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:26.383
HOW MUCH TAX BASIS. PEOPLE IN

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.617
THE OVER FIFTY FIVE CATEGORY

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:28.819
HAVE IN THEIR HOMES WE CAN MAKE

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.153
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.655
PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD MOVE.

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:32.989
AS WE GOT HONORED FIFTY MILLION

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:33.990
DOLLARS IN THE SHORT TERM

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.659
GROWING TO POTENTIALLY A BILLION

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.060
DOLLARS IN THE LONG TERM

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:38.328
ANNUALLY RIGHT.

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:38.728
SO.

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:39.863
BUT THEN WE'VE GOT THESE ARE

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.097
THE THINGS THAT WILL INCREASE

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:42.999
TAX REVENUE FOR EXAMPLE SO. THAT

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:45.235
PEOPLE WHO. WOULD NOT HAVE MOVED

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:46.603
UNDER CURRENT LAW COULD MAKE THE

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.971
DECISION TO MOVE.

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:49.673
THEY MAY SEE A DECREASE IN

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.174
PROPERTY TAX BUT THEY'LL HAVE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.109
CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON. THE.

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:55.111
THE SALE OF THE HOME ALSO

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:55.979
THEY'LL BE DOCUMENT TRANSFER

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.547
TAXES ASSESSED.

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.716
AND THEN THERE'S THE MARKET. OF

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:02.352
GREATER COMPETITION FOR HOMES

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.720
WHICH DRIVES HIGHER PRICES.

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.288
WHICH LEADS TO HIGHER PROPERTY

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:06.990
TAX VALUATIONS FOR PEOPLE EVEN

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.558
OUTSIDE OF THE OVER FIFTY FIVE

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.327
CATEGORY SO YOU PUT ALL THAT

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:11.862
TOGETHER AND.

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:12.929
I MEAN I'M I'M I'M I'M AT A LOSS

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:14.297
TO YOU KNOW WAS WEARING WHERE

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.632
THAT NETS OUT.

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:16.366
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ONLY

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:17.868
CONCRETE NUMBERS WE HAD ON THE

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:19.102
REVENUE LOSS SIDE WE DON'T HAVE

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.704
ANY CONCRETE NUMBERS ON THE

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.572
REVENUE GAINS SIDE. SO BRING CAN

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:23.974
YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON ENERGY

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:24.574
WHICH WE JUST HAVE TO CONCLUDE

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:25.876
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:26.576
SURE LET ME.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:27.878
LET ME SPEAKS TO THOSE

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.246
AFFECTION MENTION LET ME START

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:31.248
WITH THE THE KIND OF BROUGHT

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:33.483
HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. A POINT

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:33.884
WHICH.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.352
AYE SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:36.720
THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:37.988
SUGGESTS THAT WHEN HOMEOWNERS

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.556
RECEIVE PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS IT

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:40.557
DOES.

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:42.158
KIND OF THE TERM OF ART IS IT

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:43.760
GETS CAPITALIZED INTO HOME

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.095
PRICES THAT HAD KINDA IT

00:52:45.161 --> 00:52:46.730
INCREASES THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.765
FOR HOMES. ON THAT SHOWS UP IN

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:51.234
IN HIGHER HOME PRICES AND SO.

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:51.968
OTHER HAS BEEN SOME PAST

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:54.271
RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT EACH

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:57.274
DOLLAR OF PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:57.541
THERE IS.

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:58.575
.

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.944
THERE IS AN OFFSETTING.

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.512
PROPERTY VALUE PER SHE ASIAN

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.247
THAT RESULTS IN SOMEWHERE AROUND.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.049
SEVEN CENTS OF ADDITIONAL

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:07.317
PROPERTY TAX REVENUE SO THERE'S

00:53:07.384 --> 00:53:08.818
SOME OFFSETTING EFFECT BUT IT'S

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:11.688
RELATIVELY MINOR IN TERMS OF THE.

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:14.457
RESULT PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS.

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.793
ON THE POINT OF PROPERTY TAX.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.696
TRANSFER AND CAPITAL GAINS.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.231
BOTH OF THOSE EFFECTS.

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:24.000
DRIVE OFF OF ANY ADDITIONAL

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.368
HOME SALES THAT MAKER THAT

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:26.836
SOMEONE MAY BE ENCOURAGED

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.238
BY THE PASSES OF JUSTIN OF THIS

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.472
MEASURE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SOLD

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:30.574
THEIR HOME AND MOVE SOMEWHERE

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.175
ELSE OTHERWISE BUT. NOW THAT

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.710
THEY'RE RECEIVING THIS TAX

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:35.245
BENEFIT THEY MAY DO SO.

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:37.180
AND SO THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:39.215
AFFECTS DOES DEPEND ON JUST HOW

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.750
MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.519
ENCOURAGED TO MOVE.

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:44.220
OUR ESTIMATE IN THE AT THE

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.522
TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGES THAT

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:47.591
EACH OF THOSE BOTH THAT THE

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.125
PROPERTY TRANSFER REVENUES AND

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.393
THE CAPITAL GAINS. COULD

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.895
INCREASE BY.

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.997
IN THE TO SEE INCREASES IN THE

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.031
TENS OF MILLIONS.

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:57.334
AND THAT'S BASED ON.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.636
BOTH SOME OF STATISTICAL

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.037
MODELING THAT OUR OFFICE IS DONE.

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.039
AND ALSO PASSED ACADEMIC

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:03.506
RESEARCH THAT WE WERE

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:04.674
ESSENTIALLY.

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.743
MIRRORING OTHERS ATTEMPTED TO

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.044
ESTIMATE THE KIND OF THE

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.279
BEHAVIORAL FACTS

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.314
OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE RESPONDED TO

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.550
THE AND AN INCENTIVE CREATED BY

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.818
THE THAT THE SPECIAL RULES THAT

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:16.219
ARE THERE IN PLACE NOW FOR

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.821
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING. PEOPLE

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.456
OVER FIFTY FIVE REMOVING TO HOME

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.924
OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. THERE

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:22.626
HAS BEEN SOME PAST RESEARCH BY

00:54:22.692 --> 00:54:24.160
OUR OFFICE AND OTHER ACADEMICS

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.929
IT IS TRIED TO MEASURE. JUST HOW

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.964
MUCH IS THAT HOW BIG IS THAT

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.232
BEHAVIORAL FACT.

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.834
I WE SAID THAT MAYBE OUR

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.035
ESTIMATE WAS MAYBE IT COULD BE A

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.704
FEW. A FEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.905
AN INCREASE AND.

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:38.174
ADDITIONAL MOVES BUT YOU HAVE

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:38.808
TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST.

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:41.177
THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMEWHERE

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.379
AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND TWO

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:44.180
HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER FIFTY FIVE

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:46.750
HOME BUYERS NOW WE'RE MOVING.

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.451
AND NOT RECEIVING ANY TAX BREAK

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:51.154
AT ALL SO WE THINK THAT THE THAT

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.455
THE FOLKS WHO WOULD.

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:55.592
ESSENTIALLY WHO ARE MOVING NOW

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:56.426
NOT IN RESPONSE TO THIS MEASURE

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:57.394
BUT WOULD BE GETTING A TAX

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.029
BENEFIT ANYWAY.

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:01.531
THAT THAT AFFECTS.

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.133
IS ENOUGH TO.

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:06.136
KIND OF A.

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:07.470
MORE THAN COVER ANY OF THOSE

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.472
OTHER ADDITIONAL OR REVENUE

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:10.373
GAINS FROM THE THE OTHER PIECES

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.875
MATHIS ON LET ME SUMMARIZE WHAT

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.309
I HEARD YOU SAY SO REALLY WORK

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.844
WE'RE GUESSING ON BOTH SIDES OF

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.346
THE LEDGER RIGHT. WE'RE GUESSING

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:17.781
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. I

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.282
WOULD CHOOSE TO MOVE UNDER THE

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:20.817
NEW PROPOSED LAW THAT WOULD

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:21.785
WOULD NOT CHOOSE TO MOVE

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.119
OTHERWISE AND THEN WE'RE

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.954
GUESSING OUT. LA ON THE POSITIVE

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:26.856
SIDE THE LEDGER WHAT WHAT

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:27.524
EFFECTS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.793
OUR. PART TAX REVENUES FROM

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:31.394
CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND AND

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:33.863
PROPERTY APPRECIATION SO BOB BUT.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.165
WHEN WE TOTAL ALL THE GUESSES

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.733
YOU THINK IT'S NOT A NET REVENUE

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.369
LOSS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:41.204
YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT ANY ANY

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.439
EXERCISE OF DOING A FISCAL

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.973
CEMENT INVOLVES.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.241
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY GUESSING

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:46.209
OR MAKING.

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:47.911
TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE EDUCATED US

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.179
DEMANDS OF THE VARIOUS MOVING

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:51.014
PIECES I THINK. ONE THING THAT I

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.716
WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT OF THE

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.250
VARIOUS SORT OF ESTIMATES THERE

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.219
WERE HAVING TO DO I THINK THAT

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:56.453
THE ONE.

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.821
.

00:55:57.887 --> 00:55:58.988
THAT IS BOTH THE BIGGEST AND

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.290
PROBABLY THE CLEAREST AND

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:01.958
EASIEST ESTIMATE IS THE THE

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:03.460
PIECE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:04.661
ALREADY MOVING NOW UNDER CURRENT

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.962
LAW.

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.430
WHO ARE RECEIVING A TAX BENEFIT

00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:09.899
AND WILL IF THE MEASURE PASSES

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.601
SO THAT ONE IT IN IN MY MIND

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.403
PROBABLY INVOLVE THE LEAST

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.038
AMOUNT OF ASSUMPTIONS OUR

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.039
ESTIMATION THAT HOUSE TO GO INTO

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.074
IT? THE OTHER PIECES I MEAN SURE

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.976
I I DON'T THINK. WE OR ANYONE

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.778
ELSE CAN ESTIMATE WITH EXACT

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.279
PRECISION HOW MANY ADDITIONAL

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.647
PEOPLE ARE GONNA MOVE UNDER THIS

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.816
MEASURE I THINK WE DID WE DID

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:27.751
WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS.

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.586
ARE DUE DILIGENCE IN ATTEMPTING

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:30.720
TO.

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:31.221
DO.

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.623
YOU KNOW SOME WORKED ESTIMATE

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.291
THAT AND LOOK AT PAST ACADEMIC

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:36.726
RESEARCH BUT. YOU'RE RIGHT

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:39.095
NOBODY NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE.

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:40.663
EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHILE

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.132
YOU'RE A EVEN THOUGH WE'RE

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.700

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:44.300
THAT IT'S AN EDUCATED GUESS.

THANK YOU.

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.337
SITTING.

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:48.872
I THINK IT'S A JUST A FALL FROM

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.440
MY COLLEAGUE FROM PAPER SO IF IF

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:53.676

ALREADY FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO

00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.882
ARE MOVING. ANYWAYS REGARDLESS

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.283
OF THIS

TAX BREAK OR NOT AND AND FROM

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.220

GIVING THEM A TAX BREAK THAT

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:06.489
THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR NOR NEED

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:08.291
TO.

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.292
TO MOVE BECAUSE ALREADY MOVING

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:11.127
ANYWAYS SO YOU KNOW BASED ON

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.929
THAT HOW BIG A BREAK THAT THE

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:14.130
BEGINNING FOR BEHAVIOR THAT

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:17.233
THEY'RE READY EXHIBIT.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:17.867
THAT THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I THINK

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.202
THAT.

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.637
THAT THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP MOST

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:22.806
OF THE. THE NUMBERS YOU'RE

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.740

00:57:28.011 --> 00:57:29.813
IT SAMPLE IN LAW NOW OF COUNTIES

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.181
THAT CAN DO THIS SO WE DO HAVE A

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:32.549
GUESSTIMATE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:35.552
DO UTILIZE IT. THINK YOU ANY

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.186
OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

THE COMMITTEE UP.

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.523
I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.158
BECAUSE I'M OBVIOUSLY IN TO THE

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:42.992
MEETINGS AND SUPPOSED BE AND

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.061
RIGHT NOW I'M GETTING MESSAGES.

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:46.496
WHY WOULD WE DO THIS?

00:57:46.563 --> 00:57:47.864
I I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.966
THE PROBLEM IS AND AND AND

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.734
BECAUSE. I MEAN WE WE HAVE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.169
PROBLEMS WHO ATTACKS IN MOON GOT

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.871
PROP THIRTEEN INSTEAD OF DOING

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.673
ONE THING HIT THE WHOLE PROBLEM

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:57.273
HAMMER WHO STILL HAVE PROBLEMS

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.374
WITH IT.

00:57:58.441 --> 00:57:59.409
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.477
TO SOLVE.

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:03.213
THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.848
WHAT WHY HOW IT OPERATES.

00:58:04.914 --> 00:58:05.882
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:07.383
WHAT WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.319
ACTUALLY TRYING TO SOLVE. ED

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:10.453
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE ALL THESE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.388
OTHER PROBLEMS THAT I SEE JUST

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:13.323
JUST QUICKLY THIS IS NOT A

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.425
PROPONENT THIS IS THE LA ALSO

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:17.994
JUST SO YEAH AREAS AND OFF AREAS.

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:18.628
WHAT HE WAS DOING THE RESEARCH

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:19.696
SHOWS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE WILL

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:20.897
PROBABLY THEY GIVE TO YOU TO TRY

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.298
TO SOLVE?

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:24.300
SO AS I MENTIONED IN KIND OF MY

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:25.668
OPEN MY OPENING COMMENTS.

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:27.403
OUR OFFICE AS A BIT OF A.

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:28.771
A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN OUR

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.506
TRADITIONAL ROLE IN DEVISING IN

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:31.875
THE BUDGET OF THE POLICY THAT

00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:33.576
CAPACITY IN THIS ROLE THE VOTERS

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.411
HAVE PASSED US WITH BEING

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:36.980
IMPARTIAL OBJECTIVE AND FOCUSING

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.481
SOLELY ON THE FISCAL AWESOME AND

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.250
SO ALL THAT IS TO SAY.

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.551
I THINK IT PRIOR TO DEFER YOUR

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:42.986
QUESTION TO THE PROPONENTS AND

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.487
OPPONENTS WHEN THEY COME OUT

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.488
KIND OF DISCUSS.

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:46.556
WHAT THEY SEE IS THE PROBLEM

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:47.557
THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.225
SOLVE THIS BUDGET IS SOON AS AS

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:50.727
SOON AS WE? TAKE A SELLER

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.462
MELENDEZ QUESTION WILL BRING THE

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.630
PROPONENTS OF SO WE CAN SILICON

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:55.832
ASSET FOR YOU.

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.500
SO MEMORABLE AND. THANK YOU AM I

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:01.271
HAVE A QUESTION. DO YOU.

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:03.172
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.774
POLICY CHANGE.

00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:07.277
WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE OR

00:59:07.343 --> 00:59:10.280
POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HOUSING

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:11.648
SHORTAGE THAT WE ARE

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:13.850
EXPERIENCING IN CALIFORNIA.

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:18.688
BUT.

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:21.724
SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:23.826
POTENTIAL THAT ARE GOING BACK TO

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.295
THE POINT THAT I WAS MAKING

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:27.630
BEFORE THAT A WIN. HOMEOWNERS

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.065
RECEIVE PROBABLY TAX SAVINGS.

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:32.969
THEY THAT CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.938
IN SOME INCREASE AND HOME PRICES

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:35.939
DOWN THE LINE AND DESCRIBE THAT

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:38.141
MECHANISM FEW TIME. THAT.

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:39.809
INCREASE IN HOME PRICES.

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:42.078
ESPECIALLY MAYBE IN CERTAIN

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:42.478
COUNTIES THAT ARE.

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.247
.

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:45.782
TOP DESTINATIONS FOR THESE

00:59:45.848 --> 00:59:46.816
RETIREES.

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:49.752
MAY ENCOURAGE SOME DEVELOPERS

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:52.055
TO BUILD ADDITIONAL HOUSING.

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:54.290
.

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:56.459
WHEN WE LOOK TO THAT EFFECT WE

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.227
THINK THAT PROBABLY THAT WOULD

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.629
BE RELATIVELY SMALL.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.631
COMPARED TO THE SCALE OF

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.099
OVERALL DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.134
.

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.936
INCREASING IN YOU KNOW BY YOU

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.905
KNOW OUR BEST GUESS WAS PROBABLY

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.373
LESS THAN A PERCENT A YEAR.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.708
SO.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.711
IT MAY BE THERE COULD BE SOME

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.046
MODEST INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:20.016
BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE PROBABLY NOT

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.319
SIGNIFICANT.

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:24.420
THANK YOU

HOUSING SUPPLY PROBLEM.

WE BELIEVE A PARTIAL SOLUTION

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.725
ONE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.093
EFFICIENT USE OF OUR EXISTING

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.595

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.470
THERE ARE MANY BABY BOOMERS WHO

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.505
WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FROM THEIR

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:18.007
LARGE VAMPED SINGLE FAMILY HOME.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:18.574
NOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.742
MOVED OUT.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.411
THERE HOMES NO LONGER MEET THEIR

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.012

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.581
DOWNSIZING OR MOVING CLOSER TO

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.152
MANY WHO WANT TO MOVE FEEL

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:31.254
LOCKED IN PLACE SINCE THEY KNOW

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.622
THAT THEY FACE A SIZEABLE

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.524
INCREASE IN THEIR PROPERTY TAXES

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.459

THEY ARE KEPT FROM MOVING TO A

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.199
MORE SUITABLE DWELLING BECAUSE

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:44.233
OF THE SUBSTANTIAL MOVING

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.835
PENALTY THEY FACE.

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.271
ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.349
NOW WE HAVE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.584
WHICH SETS A HOMEOWNER'S

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:02.885
PROPERTY TAXES THAT ONE PERCENT

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.420
OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:06.556
IF A HOMEOWNER MOVES THEIR TAXES

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.990
ARE BASED ON THE PURCHASE PRICE

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.792
OF THE NEW HOPE. SO EVEN IF THEY

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:12.028
MOVE TO HOME OF EQUAL VALUE

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:15.264
THEIR PROPERTY TAXES WILL GO UP.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.300
NOW PROP SIXTY ALLOWS TRANSFERS

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.668
FOR SENIOR HOMEOWNERS WITHIN A

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:21.504
COUNTY BUT THE HOME MUST BE OF

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.639
EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. AND PROP

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.475
NINETY ALLOWS TRANSFERS TO OTHER

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.976
COUNTIES BUT ONLY ELEVEN

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.111
COUNTIES HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.645
SOME TRANCERS.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.581
AND ONLY A SINGLE TRANSFER IS

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.182
ALLOWED.

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.884
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SPONSORED THE

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.652
PROPERTY TAX FAIRNESS INITIATIVE.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.421
WENT PASSED IT WILL ELIMINATE

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.022
THE MOVING PELLETS FOR SENIORS

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.591
THOSE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.192
WISH TO MOVE TO SAFER. MORE

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.328
PRACTICAL HOMES OR HOMES CLOSER

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.029
TO FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.031
THE FINN IF IT'S ALSO APPLY TO

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:50.733
PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED WHO HAVE

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.068
LOST THEIR HOME DUE TO A NATURAL

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.137
DISASTER.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.605
THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES FOR

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.206
ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS THAT THEIR

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.441
CURRENT PROPERTY TAX BASE WILL

01:02:58.508 --> 01:02:59.976
BE TRANSFERRED.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.011
ONE WHEN THEY PURCHASE ANOTHER

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.546
HOME IT ANY OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.281
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.583
TWO REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY TIMES

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.886
THEY MOVE AND THREE REGARDLESS

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:10.987
OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:14.123
REPLACEMENT HOME.

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.526
IF A HOME IF A HOMEOWNER IS HAS

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.494
TO PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.229
HOME. WHICH CAN OFTEN HAPPEN

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:22.198
WHEN DOWNSIZING THEY WILL HAVE

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.033
TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THE

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.035
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALES

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:26.536
PRICE OF THEIR ORIGINAL

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:27.703
RESIDENTS.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.005
AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.806
REPLACEMENT RESIDENTS.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.074
THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR PROP

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.910
THIRTEEN SAVINGS.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.878
AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE COMBINED

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:36.879
THOSE TIPS LET ME GIVE AN

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.514
EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY YOU BOUGHT AT

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.216
A HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW TWENTY

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.450
YEARS LATER YOU'RE SELLING A TWO

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.519
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. AND YOU

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:45.454
BY UP TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.089
FIVE THOUSAND.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.157
THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.225
DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.893
TWO FIFTY AND THE THREE TWENTY

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.662
FIVE WILL BE ADDED TO THE

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:53.963
ORIGINAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.464
DOLLAR TAX BASE.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.499
SO NOW YOU HAVE A HUNDRED

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.367
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.903
BASE. FOUR HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:01.437
THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.905
THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME WHAT I WANT

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.941
YOU TO NOTICE IS. THAT THOSE

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.842
TAXES OR THE SAME EXACTLY THE

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.778
SAME AS IF THE HOMEOWNER HAVE

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.514
PURCHASED A HOME OF EQUAL VALUE.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.282
THIS.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:14.917
WAY THAT WE'RE CALCULATING THAT

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.786
NEW A PROPERTY TAX BASE ASSURES

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.454
THAT THE HOMEOWNER WILL STILL

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.256
PAY FOR HIS OR HER FOR HIS OR

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.758
HER FAIR SHARE A PROPERTY TAXES.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:23.993
BUT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED FROM

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.061
LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR TAX

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.429
BILL.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.598
NO AS I MENTION THESE BENEFITS

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:29.966
WOULD APPLY TO THE SEVERELY

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.901
DISABLED AND TO THOSE WHO LOST

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.436
THEIR HOME IN A DISASTER SUCH AS

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.838
THE TIMES FIRE LAST OCTOBER IN

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.140
NAPA SO NO MY AND LAKE COUNTIES.

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.909
OR THE THOMAS FIRE THAT

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.244
DESTROYED PARTS OF THE TOUR AND

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.545
SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES LAST

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.013
DECEMBER JANUARY.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.548
IT WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS WHO LIVE

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.416
IN AREAS LIKE THESE. THAT HAVE

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.417
BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:49.785
DISASTER BY THE GOVERNOR TO MOVE

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.320
ANYWHERE IN THE STATE WITHOUT

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.689
PAYING THE MOVING PENALTY.

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.091
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.926
HOUSING TOO MANY WOULD BE HOME

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.928
BUYERS FEEL THEY WILL NEVER BE

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:00.529
ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.531
THIS MEASURE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:04.333
TAX FAIRNESS FOR SENIORS BUT

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.501
ALSO ABOUT CREATING

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:06.902
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.804
BY INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.339
OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IN

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:12.275
ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:14.076
THIS INITIATIVE INCREASES THE

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:15.411
ABILITY OF YOUNG FAMILIES TO BUY

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.079
HOMES.

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:18.614
THUS STRENGTHENING NEIGHBORHOODS

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:20.883
AND AREA SCHOOLS THAT MAY BE

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.052
FACING DECLINING ENROLLMENT.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.253
NOW THERE'S LITTLE UARREL ABOUT

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:25.888
ALLOWING SENIORS THE DISABLED

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.423
AND OTHERS TO MOVE ELSEWHERE IN

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.257
THE STATE WHEN THEY NEED TO DO

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:31.093
SO. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE LA

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.128
OWES ESTIMATED COST OF THIS

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.796
PROPOSAL.

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.331
TO THAT END THE CALIFORNIA

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.432
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:38.100
SECURED THE SERVICES OF THE

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.169
BERKELEY RESEARCH GROUP WHICH IS

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.971
COMPOSED OF FORMER. DIRECTOR OF

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.073
FINANCE SENATOR TOM CAMPBELL AND

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.941
DOCTOR BILL HIM.

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:47.176
DR HAVE IS HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.944
HOW WE DYNAMIC FISCAL ANALYSIS

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.780
OF THE INITIATIVE REVEALS THAT

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.448
THE INITIATIVE WILL NOT COST

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.849
WHAT IS BEEN PREDICTED TO COST.

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:57.653
DOCTOR HIM.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.522
WELCOME DOCTOR HIM. THANK YOU.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:01.757
YEAH.

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:03.526
HAD CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. GOOD

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:04.694
AFTERNOON.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.928
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:07.463
.

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.898
I AM NOT AN ADVOCATE OR AN

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.533
OPPONENT OF THIS MEASURE I WAS

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.601
RETAINED BY THE REALTORS TO DO

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:14.236
AN OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.672
FISCAL ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURE.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.741
ALONG WITH TOM CAMPBELL.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:21.277
AND AS MR YOU'LL ARE PROPERLY

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.812
POINTED OUT THIS MEASURE WILL

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.780
HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.515
EFFECTS ON STATE AND LOCAL

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.784
GOVERNMENT FINANCES.

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:32.321
AFTER REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.223
ANALYZING THE MEASURE.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.991
DOCTOR CAMPBELL AND I ARE OF

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.694
THE OPINION THAT ON A NET BASIS

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.129
THIS MEASURE OF ITS ENACTED AND

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:41.564
IMPLEMENTED.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.799
WILL COME PRETTY CLOSE TO PAYING

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.168
FOR ITSELF THAT THE ADDITIONAL

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.037
REVENUES IT GENERATES.

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:51.006
WILL. A COME CLOSE TO OFFSETTING

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.275
REVENUE LOSSES THAT WE CERTAINLY

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.211
ALL AGREE ARE BUILT INTO THIS

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:56.712
MEASURE.

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.280
THE NATIONAL REVENUES ARE GOING

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.282
TO COME FROM TWO SOURCES ONE OF

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.183
WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.485
DISCUSSED AT THIS HEARING THE

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.020
OTHER HAS NOT BEEN.

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.022
THE FIRST IS THAT. THE MEASURE

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:08.824
WILL CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE MORE

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.593
HOMEOWNERS AGE FIFTY FIVE AND

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:11.994
OLDER.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.096
TO SELL THEIR CURRENT RESIDENCES

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.999
AND BUY MORE SUITABLE RESIDENCES.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.368
MORE SUITABLE TO THEIR STAGE OF

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.069
LIFE.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.204
THEIR FAMILY SIZE HERE NEED

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:23.639
TO BE CLOSE TO JOBS AND THINGS

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.107
LIKE THAT.

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.476
ANOTHER REASON IT WILL ENCOURAGE

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:29.912
MORE SALES IS. BECAUSE IT WILL

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.281
ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE THEIR

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:33.949
CURRENT ASSESSED VALUE WITH THEM

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:35.885
TO THEIR NEW HOME.

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.386
AND AS THEY MOVE OUT.

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:39.855
THAT WILL FREE UP SPACE.

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:42.091
A LOT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE ACTUALLY

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.326
FOR GROWING FAMILIES WHO WILL IN

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.929
TURN SELL THEIR HOMES AND.

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.632
UPGRADE TO.

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.268
SPACE IT'S MORE. APPROPRIATE

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:53.936
FOR THEIR NEEDS.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.604
NOW THE ADDITIONAL HOME SALES

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:58.474
WILL GENERATE CAPITAL GAINS BOTH

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.209
BOTH SETS OF SELLERS WILL

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.811
GENERATE CAPITAL GAINS.

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:04.413
A PORTION OF WHICH WILL BE TAX

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.682
AND INCREASED STATE REVENUES.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.184
BUT IN ADDITION THOSE

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:11.687
TRANSACTIONS BOTH THE. THE H.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.789
FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER AND THE

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.458
YOUNGER FAMILY MOVING UP.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.759
WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:17.860
REVENUES IN THE FORM OF TRANSFER

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.929
TAX.

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:22.031
AND ALSO GENERATE INCREASED

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.233
INCOME FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.968
WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE REAL

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.603
ESTATE MARKET.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.038
REALTORS OF COURSE BUT ALSO

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:31.974
TITLE COMPANIES MOVERS.

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:35.711
HOME INSPECTION SERVICES.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.479
HOME REMODELING.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.080
FIRMS

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.882
ALL OF ALL OF THEM WILL HAVE

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.817
MORE BUSINESS WILL REPORT MORE

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.286
INCOME ON THEIR STATE INCOME TAX.

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.655
OF FORMS AND PAY MORE INCOME

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.023
TAXES TO THE STATE.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.025
AND THE ADDITIONAL INCOME WILL

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.760
ALSO FIND ITS WAY INTO TAXABLE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.829
PURCHASES WHICH WILL GENERATE

01:08:53.896 --> 01:08:56.198
ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAXES.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:58.634
I SAID TWO FACTORS WILL GENERATE

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.536
REVENUES IN ONE OF THEM HASN'T

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.137
BEEN I DON'T THINK ADEQUATELY

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:03.873
DISCUSSED IN AND THAT'S WHAT I

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.608
WANT TO TURN TO RIGHT NOW.

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.576
THE DOCTOR CAMPBELL AND I ARE

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.111
CONVINCED THAT THE INCREASE IN

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.646
DEMAND FOR SENIOR FRIENDLY

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.448
HOUSING.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:13.516
NOT RESULTING FROM THIS

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:16.819
INITIATIVE WILL SPUR SIGNIFICANT

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:20.189
NEW CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH HOUSING.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.590
LOG IN RESPONSE TO THAT

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:23.459
INCREASED DEMAND.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.628
OF THE INCREASE IN HOME BUILDING

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:28.163
WILL. NOT PUT MORE PROPERTY ON

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:30.733
THE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS AS. A

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.501
BUILDINGS ARE PUT IN PLACE ON

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.736
WHAT IS NOW TAXED AS WERE ALL

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:34.970
LAND.

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.540
OKAY IN ADDITION. TO THE HOME

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:38.641
CONSTRUCTION PROCESS WILL

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.709
GENERATE MORE INCOME FOR

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.545
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:44.580
FOR BUILDERS TO CREATE MORE

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.949
JOBS THAT WILL INCREASE TAXABLE

01:09:47.016 --> 01:09:49.885
INCOME AND ALSO TAXABLE SPENDING.

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:52.254
IT WILL STIMULATE ADDITIONAL

01:09:52.321 --> 01:09:54.857
PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.058
THAT ARE NEEDED TO EQUIP NEW

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.626
HOMES.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:58.994
AND.

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.362
THAT TOO WILL GENERATE

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:02.131
ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAXES

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:04.099
ARE REALLY. ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.701
SOURCES OF REVENUE TO THE STATE

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:06.969
AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.537
BENEFIT.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.773
FROM THIS INITIATIVE.

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.242
IN OUR OPINION THE ADDITIONAL

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.144
REVENUES WILL OFFSET A

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.279
SIGNIFICANT PORTION IF NOT ALL

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:19.114
OF THE REVENUE LOSS RESULTING

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:21.250
FROM EXTENDING THE BENEFITS OF

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:23.118
PROPOSITION SIXTY.

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:26.121
TWO ADDITIONAL SENIORS.

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.991
IN FACT IF HOME BUILDERS. ARE.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.594
SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIVE. TO THE

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.028
INCREASED DEMAND FOR SENIOR

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:35.030
FRIENDLY HOUSING AND HOME

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.365
BUILDERS THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.800
DO THEY BUILD HOMES.

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:39.401
IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENTLY

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:40.502
RESPONSIVE.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.438
IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS MEASURE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.607
WILL PAY FOR ITSELF.

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.141
NOW THERE'S ONE MORE FACT TO

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.476
CONSIDERAND.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.346
LOOKING AT THE FISCAL THE FACT

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.114
OF THE INITIATIVE.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.282
AND THAT'S THE REAL WORLD

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.284
EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTIES UNDER

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.252
PROPOSITION NINETY.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.088
IS MR YOU'LL ARE EXPLAINED

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.623
COUNTIES HAVE THE CHOICE UNDER

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.291
PROPOSITION NINETY.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:05.494
TO ALLOW. CERTAIN INTER COUNTY

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.696
MOVERS TO BRING THEIR OLD ASSESS

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.064
VALUE WITH THEM TO THEIR NEW

01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:10.799
HOME.

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:13.135
NOW IF THE TRANSFERS WERE

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.404
SIGNIFICANT MONEY LOSERS WE

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.106
WOULD NOT EXPECT THE COUNTIES TO

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.974
AGREE THAT THIS.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.709
YET THE STATE'S SEVEN LARGEST

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.978
COUNTIES AND PROBABLY THE MOST

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:24.046
FINANCIALLY SOPHISTICATED

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:25.614
COUNTIES.

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.716
OKAY INTEND YOU TO ALLOW ENTRY

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.485
INTO COUNTY MOVERS TO BRING

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.186
THEIR OLD NAVY WITH THEM TO

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.588
THEIR NEW HOME.

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.123
AND SOME OF THEM MOST OF THEM

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:35.591
HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR THIRTY

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.959
YEARS.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.061
WE THINK THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.497
OUR OPINION THAT THE SPUR TO NEW

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.365
HOME CONSTRUCTION.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.767
COMING FROM THE INITIATIVE WILL

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:46.435
GENERATE DOES.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:47.770
YEAH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.905
REVENUE THAT WILL HELP HELP LOSS

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.507
AT THOSE COST AND PERHAPS NOT

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.208
COVER ALL OF THEM. I AM MORE

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.476
THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:57.980
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.315
MISTER KARIM.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.317
THANK YOU I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.053
ON THE TIME ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.988
MAKE CARE I GUESS IF IF YOU LOOK

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.589
AT THESE TO THE PROPONENTS

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:09.291
ARGUMENT AND THE OPPOSITION I

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.893
THINK MOST OF US.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.461
ARE ON THE SAME SIDE WHAT TO

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:14.329
ADDRESS THAT HOUSING CRISIS IN

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:15.564
THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THE

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:17.199
SUPPLY ISSUE AS WELL AS.

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.168
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE. ADEQUATE

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:21.170
MONIES FOR OUR.

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.037
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.273
SPECIFICALLY OUR SCHOOLS AND SO

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:26.575
THAT THE CRUX OF THE DEBATE HERE

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.577
IS. THE DON.

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:30.345
THE DIFFERING OPINION YOU HAVE

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:31.980
THAT ARE ALEJO. ITS IS ONE IF

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.549
YOU COULD WALK THROUGH HOW YOU

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.050
GET THERE A BIT MORE SO

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:37.052
ESSENTIALLY IF I BOIL IT DOWN.

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:38.353
THERE THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.089
THAT YOU DON'T SEE IS THEY TALK

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:42.224
ABOUT THE WINDFALL THAT THAT THE

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.159
MAJORITY OF THESE.

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:46.528
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE DOING THIS

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.864
ANYWAY OKAY YEAH THIS THERE'S NO

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.899
DISAGREEMENT ON THAT POINT AND

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:54.036
THE THE REAL ISSUE FROM A FISCAL.

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:56.839
EFFECTS STANDPOINT IS. WILLIE

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:58.373
ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT THE

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.110
MANAGER GENERATES BE SUFFICIENT.

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.545
TO OFFSET THAT BUILT IN LOSS

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.547
THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED.

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.850
THERE. ANYTIME YOU GIVE SOMEONE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.618
A BENEFIT.

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.887
THAT THEY DID NOT REQUIRE IN

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:14.690
ORDER TO ACTED NO WAY THEY DID.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.358
IT'S IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.061
EFFECT OF REDUCING PROPERTY TAX

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.963
REVENUES.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.031
BUT THAT IN ITSELF IS NO DEBATE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:25.234
OVER THAT THE THE ISSUE IS

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.535
WHETHER IT'S GOING TO SPUR

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:28.804
ENOUGH NEW CONSTRUCTION.

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.140
TO GENERATE REVENUE TO OFFSET

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:33.142
THOSE LOSSES AND I THINK THERE

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:35.978
ARE THREE REASONS WHY IT IS

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.713
LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.948
A SIGNIFICANT SPUR TO HOUSING

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.650
CONSTRUCTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.685
INCREASE IN DEMAND.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.053
NUMBER ONE THE INCREASE IN

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.623
DEMAND IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.992
A VERY PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF THE

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:52.027
HOUSING MARKET. IT WERE SPREAD

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.263
THROUGHOUT. THE HOUSING MARKET

01:13:54.329 --> 01:13:55.531
IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT NOT HAVE

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:56.932
MUCH OF AN IMPACT.

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:57.966
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IT'S

01:13:58.033 --> 01:13:59.868
GOING TO BE FOCUSED.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.370
MY NEXT SEGMENT OF THE MARKET

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.638
THAT SERVES.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.473
SENIORS

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.242
CONDOMINIUMS WITH ELEVATORS.

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:10.546
TOWNHOUSES WITH ZERO LOT LINES.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:13.615
SENIOR COMMUNITIES LIKE ROSS

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:15.250
MORE WHERE THERE'S NO UP CAPE

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:16.752
UPKEEP FOR THE RESIDENTS.

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.054
IT'S ALL DONE BY THE OF THE

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.923
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.791
THE THE DEMAND THAT THIS

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.393
INITIATIVE IS GOING TO SPUR IS

01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.828
GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.930
SEGMENT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:28.864
THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE MUCH

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:29.965
MORE OF AN IMPACT.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.133
IN TERMS OF SPURRING

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.235
CONSTRUCTION.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:34.970
CLINTON NUMBER TWO IT'S A KIND

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.071
OF HOUSING PARTICULARLY

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.806
CONDOMINIUMS.

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:40.409
THAT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND HOW

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:41.577
IT USES LAND SO IT'S

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.379
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND AS

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.547
PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND CITY

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:47.049
COUNCILS.

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:49.484
BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:51.086
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.988
IT'STHE KIND OF OF HOUSING THAT

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:54.990
THAT THAT MOST RESPONSIVE TO

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:56.725
THOSE CONCERNS AND SO I THINK

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:57.926
IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER FOR

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.528
BUILDERS TO GET THOSE NEAR PLANS

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.929
APPROVED.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.497
AND NUMBER THREE.

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:04.266
THE.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.268
THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE NEW

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.970
CONSTRUCTION SENIORS.

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:10.806
OUR AS A DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:11.940
IS THE GROUP THAT IS MOST

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:13.108
WELCOME IN CALIFORNIA

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.810
COMMUNITIES.

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.111
THEY DON'T PUT A BURDEN ON THE

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.646
SCHOOL SYSTEMS THEY DON'T

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.115
CONTRIBUTE TO CONGESTION AT.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.250
EIGHT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.684
MORNING AND AND FIVE O'CLOCK IN

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.319
THE EVENING.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.655
AND MY WIFE WHO SPENT THE LAST

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:27.756
THIRTY YEARS.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.691
IN.

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:31.093
TRYING TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.495
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.297
TELLS ME THAT THE REAL PROBLEM

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.633
IS. GETTING LOCAL PLANNING

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.635
COMMISSIONS AND AND AND CITIES

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.203
TO AGREED TO SERVE BUILD FAMILY

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.738
HOUSING.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:43.839
BUT SENIORS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.574
WELCOME SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.142
VERY GOOD REASON THEIR NUMBER

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.911
VERY GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:50.412
THAT IN THIS CASE THERE IS GOING

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:51.513
TO BE AN INCREASE IN IN

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.048
CONSTRUCTION AND THAT'S GOING TO

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.616
HAVE ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS THAT

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:58.053
I MENTIONED. JUST A FOLLOW UP IF

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.521
I IF I COULD AND CHECK.

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.723
SO WHY WHY DO YOU THINK THE LA

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:04.192
EL IS IS DISCOUNTING THAT THAT

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:04.393
THE.

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.261
ARGUMENTS YOU'RE PUSHING AS FAR

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:08.196
AS THE IMPACT OF THAT

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.898
CONSTRUCTION ON THIS NICHE.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.667
INDUSTRY AND THAT THAT THE NEXT

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.535
SUB SEGMENT OF THIS INDUSTRY.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.570
WELL I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:16.672
AND ADMIRATION FOR THE

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.407
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.775
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.644
SPEAKING FOR THEM. I DID NOTE

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.546
THAT MR YOU'LL ARE SAID HIS

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.949
TESTIMONY TODAY WAS BASED ON THE

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.817
PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE. THAT THEY

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.719
MADE BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:32.521
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS PART OF

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:34.790
THE TITLE AND SUMMARY PROCESS.

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.558
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR FINAL

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.226
ESTIMATE IS GOING TO BE.

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.062
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WILL

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:41.229
LOOK MORE FAVORABLY ON THE

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.998
ARGUMENTS

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:45.267
THE ANALYSIS THAT MISTER DOCTOR

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.835
CAMPBELL AND I HAVE HAVE. HAD

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:49.104
HAVE DONE BUT I CAN'T AND I

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:50.939
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM.

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.207
BUT THE BUT BASIC POINT WE MAKE

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.876
HERE IS THAT YOU CAN'T APPLY THE

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:57.079
OVERALL CONSTRUCTION RATE TO

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.814
THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF OF

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.283
HOUSING THE SMALLER. TYPE OF

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.883
HOUSING THAT DOCTOR HIM JUST

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.186
DESCRIBED.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.487
SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.489
YOU MENTION THAT ONLY ELEVEN

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.224
COUNTIES RIGHT NOW PARTICIPATE

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:10.392
AND IT'S A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.827
WITHIN STATE LAW RAIN NOW MY

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.195
QUESTION WOULD BE WHY ONLY

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:16.064
ELEVEN PARTICIPATING NOW IF IT'S.

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.333
SO USEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE THE

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.435
MY OTHER QUESTION IS ON.

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.403
BASED ON EXPERIENCE I HAVE A

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.739
MOTHER OF ADVANCED AGE I'M NOT

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.240
GONNA GIVE HER IS HOME NOW SHE

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.775
WOULD KILL ME.

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:29.144
HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.379
THE LOAN PROCESS AND SO MY

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.446
QUESTION ON WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.148
ABOUT CONSTRUCTION OF THESE THIS

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.549
HOUSING FOR SENIORS IS.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.485
IN YOUR ESTIMATION ARE THESE

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.253
HOMES IS ARE THESE TRANSFER

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.222
HOMES MORE EXPENSIVE OR LESSER

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:44.526
VALUE. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.961
SOMETIMES BUYING A HOME AND AN

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.696
ADVANCED AGE IS A CHALLENGE NOT

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:48.897
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A LIMITED

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.832
INCOME EVEN IF YOU HAVE SAVINGS

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.334
AND YOU AT EQUITY FROM YOUR HOME.

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.269
THAT SAVINGS DOESN'T ALWAYS

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.670
OFFSET IN THE LENDING PROCESS

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:56.772
THE FACT THAT YOU EITHER ARE

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:58.407
JUST YOUR INCOME IS JUST

01:17:58.473 --> 01:17:59.875
RETIREMENT. OR.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.376
OR THAT YOU'RE AND OF ADVANCED

01:18:01.443 --> 01:18:02.310
AGE AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR A

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:03.879
THIRD I'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEONE

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:04.946
SAY TO ME BUT SHE'S.

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.314
THIS AGENT IT'S A THIRTY YEAR

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.817
LOAN SO HOW IN YOUR CALCULATION

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:10.685
HAVE YOU TAKEN THAT AND THEN MY

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:12.421
QUESTION ABOUT THE LEFT INCOMES.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.756
SO I I I THINK YOUR SECOND POINT

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:17.259
IS A VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION AND

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:18.960
I AGREED THAT THIS IS NOT GOING

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.229
TO BE A PANACEA FOR ALL SENIORS

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.964
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.533
I THINK THAT AGAIN AND I'M I'M

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.668
NOT MAKING THE CASE FOR AGAINST

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:27.569
THE INITIATIVE BUT.

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:31.039
IT IT CERTAINLY WILL. REMOVE

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:33.508
SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT.

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.343
TWO SENIOR IS FINDING MORE

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:37.813
SUITABLE HOUSE SCENE BY ALLOWING

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.848
THEM TO AT LEAST MAINTAIN THEIR

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:42.484
CURRENT ASSESSED VALUE BASE.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.953
AND NOT HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.556
FOR PROPERTY TAXES NOW THE REST

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:50.425
OF THE ECONOMICS OF THE MOVE.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.394
MAY MAY NOT ALLOW THAT MOVED TO

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:53.829
TAKE TAKE PLACE BUT FOR MANY

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:57.432
PEOPLE IT WILL.

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:58.733
WITH REGARD TO THE IRAQ QUESTION

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.835
WITH REGARD TO THE PROP NINETY

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.070
COUNTIES A I HONESTLY TO DO NOT

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:04.573
UNDERSTAND. WHY THERE HAVEN'T

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.408
BEEN MORE COUNTIES OF SIGNED UP

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.576
BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE COUNTIES

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:09.811
THAT HAVE OPTED IN TO PROP

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.480
NINETY?

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:12.814
HAVE AS DOCTOR.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.182
HAVE DESCRIBED THEY'VE BEEN IN

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.050
THE PROGRAM FOR FOR YEARS

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.618
DECADES

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.154
AND THEY HOLD ABOUT TWO THIRDS

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.822
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VENTURA

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:23.492
ORANGE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:25.794
SENATOR THESE ARE BIG COUNTIES.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.962
AND THEY CLEARLY HAVE COME TO

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:27.596
THE CONCLUSION THEY ARE LOSING

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.364
MONEY. AND THAT'S SECOND THEY'VE

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.799
CONTINUED TO STAY IN THE PROGRAM

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:32.667
L. WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:33.969
BECAUSE IT'S AYE. ELEVEN

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:36.104
COUNTIES IS NOT THAT MANY AND SO

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.239
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:38.640
THAT THOSE ARE LARGE COUNTIES I

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:39.708
WONDER IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.576
MORE COUNTIES BUT THEY MIGHT.

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.044
MISTER BLOOM.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:43.311
THANK YOU.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:44.546
.

A.

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.316
YOU'RE SEATED AT THE TABLE.

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:50.051
ARMED WITH THE PROPONENTS FOR

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.954
THIS MEASURE NEW TWICE SAID THAT

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.157
YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR AGAINST THE

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.658
MEASURE BUT.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:57.959
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE SEATED AT

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.162
THIS TABLE IF SOMEBODY DIDN'T

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.663
THINK THAT YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:03.932
BE FAVOR FAVORABLE TO THE.

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:07.169
UP PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:10.038
BOB WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:13.308
I'M WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SYSTEM

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.943
THAT ALLOWS FOR MANY OF THESE

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.379
TRANSFERS TO TAKE PLACE CORRECT

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:20.515
YES SO WHY ARE YOU NOT RELYING

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.983
ON STATISTICS.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.085
SHOWING THAT THERE'S INCREASED

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.421
HOMEBUILDING TAKING PLACE AS A

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.723
RESULT. OF THE CURRENT

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.025
CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.026
EXTRAPOLATING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:32.561
IN THE FUTURE.

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:34.796
WE WE WE LOOK FOR THAT THAT KIND

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.598
OF DATA AND ALL WEEK WE WE'RE IN

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.100
CONTACT WITH THE CENTER FOR.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.368
RESEARCH ON THE REAL ESTATE

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:42.837
MARKET AT UC BERKELEY.

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:45.006
AND THE ONLY DATA THAT THEY

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:48.109
COULD REFER US TO IS DATA ON.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:50.045
AGGREGATE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:52.881
STATEWIDE WHICH ISN'T RESPONSIVE.

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.516
TO THE ISSUES THAT I THINK WE'RE

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.418
FACING HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.986
A LIMITED SEGMENT OF THE MARKET.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.287
GIVE THAT KIND OF DATA WAS

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:01.556
AVAILABLE ON THE IMPACT OF THE

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:03.892
PROPS SIXTY PROGRAM

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.193
YOU'RE RIGHT WE WOULD JUST

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.761
EXTRAPOLATE THAT BUT THAT DATA

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:09.264
JUST ISN'T AVAILABLE SO THE DATA

01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.700
DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND YET

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:13.134
YOU'RE ABLE TO.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.603
.

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:15.904
DO WHAT YOU KNOW MIKE MY

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.139
COLLEAGUEFROM BIG BEAR WAS I'M

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:20.175
SUGGESTING THAT TO MISTER

01:21:20.242 --> 01:21:21.376
HEWLETT WAS KIND OF GUESSING.

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:23.745
AS TO WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:25.213
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.015
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS ANY

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:29.951
BETTER THAN THE GAS EITHER. YOUR.

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:32.354
YOUR YOUR CONCLUSION IS BASED

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.655
ON OUGHT IF I UNDERSTAND

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.357
CORRECTLY ON THE THREE POINTS

01:21:35.423 --> 01:21:36.424
THAT YOU MADE THAT.

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:39.160
THERE'LL BE INCREASED DEMAND.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.929
BECAUSE SENIORS ARE GOING TO

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:42.664
WANT TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO IN

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.333
THERE FOR THIS MARKET IS SOMEHOW

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.802
GOING TO MATERIALIZE FOR THEM.

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:49.738
AND IN SUPPORT OF THAT YOUR

01:21:49.804 --> 01:21:51.906
POINTS TWO AND THREE ARE THAT

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.108
IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER TO

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:55.143
APPROVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.411
SENIORS BETTER.

01:21:56.478 --> 01:21:59.381
AND SENIORS ARE MORE ACCEPTABLE

01:21:59.447 --> 01:22:00.782
TO COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.050
DON'T DRIVE.

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:04.119
I HAD I BEEN IN THIS CATEGORY

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.855
FOR TEN YEARS I'M STILL DRIVING

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.256
AND I EXPECT THAT I WILL BE FOR

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:09.858
AWHILE. AND WHEN I STOPPED

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.326
DRIVING.

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.495
I'LL PROBABLY IF YOU KNOW THAT

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.230
SHOULD HAPPEN AT SOME POINT I

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:17.899
WILL PROBABLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:18.833
A.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.568
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.404
IN NEW PARA LIFT TO GET ME

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:23.571
AROUND THAT DOESN'T REDUCE CAR

01:22:23.638 --> 01:22:24.773
TRIPS

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.508
SO I YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY WHO

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:28.109
SERVED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:30.245
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. THE DYNAMICS

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:32.213
OF HOW DEVELOPMENT.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.183
GETS BUILT OR DOESN'T GET BELT.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.886
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA CHANGE

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:38.420
AS A RESULT OF THIS BALLOT

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.921
MEASURE.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:40.989
IF I MIGHT ADD.

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:43.124
BECAUSE THIS UNDER PROP SIXTY

01:22:43.191 --> 01:22:44.492
PROP NINETY IS A ONE TIME

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:46.828
BENEFIT PEOPLE HAVE TO ELECT TO

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.463
USE THAT AND WE FOUND THAT.

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:50.665
THERE'S.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:52.500
A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROP

01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.235
SIXTY PROP NINETY INTO A LOT OF

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.104
SENIORS DON'T USE THAT AS A

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.539
RESULT IT ONLY MAKES UP ABOUT

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.808
TWO PERCENT OF ALL TRANSACTIONS.

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.543
SO WOULD BE DIFFICULT GIVEN THE

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.912
LOW UTILIZATION RATE TO DRAW.

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.580
CONCLUSIONS BASED ON ITS

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:09.117
EXISTING YEARS.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:12.654
THANK YOU.

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:13.688
AND OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:16.257
ASSERTING.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:18.293
DESPITE BACK MISTER HAM ó WHAT

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.894
ARE YOUR SUPPOSITIONS IN TERMS

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.931
OF REVENUE GROWTH WAS. A SPUR OF

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.532
NEW CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT DID

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.266
YOU.

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.669
ESTIMATE WHERE THIS NEW

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.170
CONSTRUCTION WAS GOING TO OCCUR.

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:31.873
AND IT'S GOING TO OCCUR IN THAT

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:32.941
SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:35.744
CALIFORNIA BUT MORE LIKELY. NOT

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.212
IN THE HIGHEST.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:41.716
PRICED REAL ESTATE ON THE COAST.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:43.385
MORE LIKELY.

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.854
FURTHER INLAND. BUT NO WE

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.356
DIDN'T DUH WE DIDN'T DO A

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:49.257
GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF WHERE

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.192
IT'S LIKELY TO BE BUILT.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.160
WELL I GUESS JUST LOOKING AT

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.795
THAT.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.764
TEN COUNTY THAT ALREADY. ALLOW

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:56.331
THE PROP NINETY TRANSFERRED

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.233
THAT'S.

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:00.068
POPULATION WISE I'M JUST

01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:02.404
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. ON LOOKS

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.406
LIKE HALF THE POPULATION OF THE

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:06.007
STATE'S READY COVERED BY.

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.843
THESE COUNTIES AND IN LARGE PART

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:10.512
MOST OF ALMOST ALL OF.

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:11.546
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE THERE

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.381
WOULD BE.

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:15.784
IT COULD BE ARE DID I DO ALREADY.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.285
I'M SUPPOSING THAT THERE'S GOING

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.320
TO BE ONLY DEVELOPMENT IN

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.389
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.023
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY ALREADY

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:22.724
CAN DO THESE.

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:23.425
TRANSFER IS WHAT YOU'RE SAN

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:26.194
BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE ORANGE SAN

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.463
DIEGO LA VENTURA ALL OF SOUTHERN

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.064
CALIFORNIA CAN DO IT.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:32.267
NOW IT'S. THAT THE FEATURE OF

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.568
THE INITIATIVE THAT'S GOING TO

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:34.469
BE MOST RELEVANT TO SOUTHERN

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.671
CALIFORNIA IS A FEATURE THAT

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.640
WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO PAY MORE

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.875
FOR THEIR NEW HOME THAN THE

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.076
PRICE AT WHICH THEY SOLD THEIR

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:44.078
OLD HOME. AND STILL GET THE

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.447
BENEFITS AND SO THAT WILL BE

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:47.015
VERY RELEVANT TO THE SOUTHERN

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.850
CALIFORNIA COUNTIES.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.752
BUT YOUR YOUR GAS ABOUT THEOREM

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.487
THERE DID THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:54.088
OF THE ELEVEN COUNTIES WAS RIGHT

01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:56.491
ON ITS FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.126
STATE'S POPULATION AREAS ARE IN

01:24:58.193 --> 01:24:59.260
THOSE COUNTIES RIGHT SO JUST NOT

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.195
CLEAR TO ME WHERE THIS

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.963
CONSTRUCTION BOOM WOULD. TAKE

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.298
PLACE AND HOW THEY WOULD BE

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.033
BENEFITS I WAS GONNA ASK. INTO

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:05.633
MISTER CARLYLE'S POINT HUNDRED

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.035
REPRESENTING EGGMAN YOU'RE BEING

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:08.970
THE COUNTY ASSESSOR FROM WHEN

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:09.737
THE COUNTY SAID DIDN'T.

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:11.439
HAS NOT OP I MEAN.

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.807
YOU GOT TO THINK OF SAN

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:18.813
FRANCISCO OPTING A MARKET THAT IS

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.316
ON. ON AFFORDABLE THEY WOULD

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.852
JUST MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:25.487
ON AFFORDABLE THAT'S WHEN THE

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.154
REASONS WE HAVE AN AMERICAN EVEN

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.522
TELL YOU. HOW MANY PHONE CALLS I

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:28.857
PICKED UP FROM SENIORS WHO

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.525
WANTED TO MOVE? INTO SAN

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.494
FRANCISCO AND ARMY IT WOULD

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.095
CONTINUE TO PRICE OUT ALL THE

01:25:34.162 --> 01:25:35.864
FAMILIES AND. AND ALL THE PEOPLE

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:37.699
WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO. HANG ON

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:37.866
TO.

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:40.168
WE DON'T GET THEIR LITTLE

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:41.936
TOENAIL INTO THE. TO THE HOUSING

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:43.872
MARKETS TO JUST I GUESS BASED ON

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:45.607
YOUR. ECONOMIC I JUST DON'T

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.642
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE REVENUES

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:49.143
COMING FROM IN TERMS OF NEW

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.479
CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE. IF THIS IS

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:52.247
SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.717
OCCURRING. IN ON INLAND

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:57.118
CALIFORNIA MEETING IN SAMBOR

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:59.687
MEDINA MEANING IF SOMEONE FROM

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:00.989
LA CAN ALREADY GO TO SAN

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:02.156
BERNADINE OUT WHY ISN'T THIS

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:04.459
BUILDING BOOM ALREADY OCCURRING

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:05.860
BECAUSE IF I'M. LIVING IN WEST

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:09.430
LA AND I CAN GO OUT TO ON. YOUR

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:12.267
SABATINO WERE PALM SPRINGS ARE

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.536
SO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR ORDER

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.504
SANTEE WHY WHY AM I NOT DOING

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.505
THAT ALREADY LITTLE FOR FIRST OF

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:18.840
ALL I I WOULD NOT SUBMIT THAT IT

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:19.874
IS NOT OCCURRING.

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:20.742
THERE ARE STILL HOMES BEING

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.343
BUILT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:23.411
I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS. A

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:24.646
SIGNIFICANT PORTION MAY BE AND

01:26:24.712 --> 01:26:26.581
RESPONSE TO THESE AND TRIP

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.650
INTERCOUNTY MOVES BUT THE SAYING

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:33.988
THAT IT WILL CAUSE MORE INTER

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:34.789
COUNTY MOVES.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:35.757
AND WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO THE

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:37.825
HOUSING MARKETS IN SOUTHERN

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.227
IS TO FEATURE THAT DOESN'T

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:41.162
RESTRICTED.

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:44.198
TO THOSE WHOSE. NEW HOME COSTS.

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:47.335
MORE THAN THEIR OLD HOME.

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:48.303
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:50.905
ADDITIONAL DEMAND WILL COME.

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.607
BUT DID HE BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.642
RESTRICTION YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.077
DATA CURRENTLY.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.078
SUPPORTING YOUR SOME SHARE

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.813
AROUND NEW CONSTRUCTION MEANING

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.681
YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.350
DATA DOES DEMONSTRATING IF I'M

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:03.851
LIVING ON THE WHOLE YA I'M

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:05.820
MOVING INLAND BECAUSE OF THIS

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:09.357
CONSTRUCTION.

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:10.191
NO I I THINK LET ME IF I MAY

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:10.592
RESPOND TO THAT.

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:12.627
SO THERE'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:14.462
FIFTY OF THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.564
ANNUALLY AND IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:19.200
THAT THIS WOULD RESULT IN FORTY

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.068
THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:21.936
TRANSACTIONS ABOUT A TEN PERCENT

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:22.570
INCREASE.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.973
SO THAT'S ABOUT A TEN PERCENT

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:27.141
INCREASE IN TRANSACTIONS AND YET

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.410
BELIAU SAYING NO NEW ADDITIONAL

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:31.679
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.047
WHITTAKER AND AND WE WE JUST

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:33.648
SOMETHING THAT THAT MAKES ANY

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:34.782
SENSE WE THINK IF YOU LOOK AT

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:37.785
THE OVERALL IF YOU'RE BUILDING A

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:40.154
SINGLE FAMILY HOME. THAT'S NOT

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:40.488
GONNA HAPPEN.

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.623
BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:44.292
IF YOU'RE BUILDING SMALLER HOMES

01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:46.561
THEN YOU KNOW THAT AND WHICH ARE

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.196
LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD THOSE

01:27:48.262 --> 01:27:48.830
ARE THE TYPES OF HOMES THAT WILL

01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:50.098
BE BUILT.

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:51.332
SO SAYING HOW MANY TRANSACTIONS

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:52.600
OCCURRING NOW.

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.469
DUH LA OWES ESTIMATED THAT WOULD

01:27:54.535 --> 01:27:55.937
BE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.639
ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS WE SET

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.107
NO IN REALITY HOW ME ART HOW

01:27:59.173 --> 01:28:01.542
ABOUT FORTY OF FOREIGN THIRTY

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:03.144
THOUSAND A. MONTH ONE THREE

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:03.778
THOUSAND FOOT AND OF THOSE HOW

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.414
MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO.

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:08.716
SENIOR HOMES IN OTHER

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:11.119
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES.

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.453
AND SPURRING THIS NEW

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.889
CONSTRUCTION AYE I DON'T HAVE

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.391
THAT THAT KIND OF AND THAT'S A

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.659
CENTRAL ASSUMPTION OF MS RIGHT

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:18.026
HEMIS RESEARCH.

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:19.060
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.528
DATA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:21.729
ABILITY TO MOVE TO OTHER

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:22.597
COUNTIES AS RESTRICTIVE THAT'S

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:23.564
THAT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN IF I'M IN

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.133
SAN DIEGO I CAN GO TO SAN

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.568
BERNARDINO. YEAH BUT THERE ARE

01:28:27.635 --> 01:28:28.202
FINE NOW AND I CAN GO TO FORTY

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:30.104
SEVEN OTHER COUNTIES YOU CAN'T

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:32.240
GO TO IF WE WEAK WEAKEN IPAD AS

THERE'S THERE'S ACTUAL ACTUAL

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:11.672
DATA AS OF TODAY. AND WE KNOW

FOR THESE FORTY THREE THOUSAND

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.243
PEOPLE TO GET A TRANSFER THEY

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:16.210
HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THEY'RE

LEAVING AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.714
SO WE KNOW THAT. THE THIS IS SO

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.349
I'M JUST ASKING THE PROPONENTS.

01:30:21.415 --> 01:30:23.518
WHETHER GOING ALL WE'RE TRYING

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:24.185
TO DO IS POINT OUT THAT THERE IS.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.187
.

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.623
INCONSISTENCY WITH REGARD TO THE

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:29.924
LA THOSE.

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:30.858
ANALYSIS IN WHICH THEY'RE

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:31.893
SAYING THERE'S THAT THEY'LL BE

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.694
THIS INCREASING DEMAND BUT NO

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:34.495
INCREASE NO.

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:36.831
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:39.033
WONDERSTRUCK UNDERSTAND YOUR.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.369
ANALYSIS THAT YOU PAID FOR ARM.

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:42.670
THE ANALYSIS OF THE FORTY THREE

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:44.639
THOUSAND AND THIS ASSUMPTION

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:47.408
AROUND THE REVENUE GROWTH AND.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.442
WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM BECAUSE

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.111
OBVIOUSLY?

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:52.180
YOU YOU I ASSUME MISTER MISTER

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:53.514
HAMM DOCTOR CAMPBELL SAW OF

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:54.081
THESE FORTY THREE THOUSAND

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:56.250
INDIVIDUALS. EXTEMPORE WENT INTO

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:58.686
THESE SENIOR HOMES WHICH WOULD.

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:00.488
HOW THIS PIECE IN A PRECEPTOR

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:03.057
SUPPOSITION THAT HEY? IF IF THIS

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:05.193
WENT UP IF THIS NUMBER WENT UP

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:06.961
TO LET'S SAY A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:10.064
THAT THIS WOULD SPUR. A EXPERT

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:12.166
AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IT WOULD

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.801
IF IN FACT THOSE FORTY THREE

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:15.036
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WERE GOING

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:18.005
TO THESE TYPES OF PROPERTIES.

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:19.974
SURVIVAL THINKS.

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:22.577
SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING IT'S IS

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:24.145
SO CO CHAIR OF THE JOINT OF A

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:25.313
JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

01:31:25.379 --> 01:31:26.714
SO IT CHAIR.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.884
SO THE QUESTION IS FINE HOWEVER

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.152
I BELIEVE THAT THE DATA IS JUST

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.520
NOT AYE. AYE AS SO FAR WHAT

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:34.255
WE'VE GATHERED IS THAT THERE IS

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.157
NOT SUFFICIENT DATA ON SEVERAL

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:37.925
POINTS OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.628
AND WHETHER YOUR OPPONENT ARE.

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:42.029
NOT IF YOU'RE PROPONENT FOR OPEN

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:42.997
UP.

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:45.266
THE DATA IS LACKING HOWEVER

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:47.368
WITHOUT I BELIEVE. AS A MEMBER

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:49.537
MURATSUCHI HAS A QUESTION. YES

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:50.905
COMMENT THANK YOU SO.

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.541
THAT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE AS

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.642
YOU HIGHLIGHTED BETWEEN THE

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.177
CURRENT LAW AND THE PROPOSED

01:31:56.244 --> 01:31:57.745
INITIATIVE IS THAT IT WOULD

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:00.715
ALLOW. PEOPLE TO CARRY THEIR.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.216
PROP THIRTEEN.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.452
ASSESSMENT TO THEIR NEW

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.621
PROPERTY IF IT'S GRAY OF GREATER

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:08.723
VALUE THAN THEIR CURRENT HOME IS

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.057
THAT CORRECT RIGHT BESIDE RIGHT

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:11.459
NOW UNDER PROP SIXTY PROP NINETY

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.060
S. B. EQUAL LESSON. SO IF YOU

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.228
PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:16.063
EAT EVEN IF THE DOLLAR OVER YOU

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:17.732
CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSFER SO IS

01:32:17.798 --> 01:32:19.267
THERE DATA SHOWING THAT THESE.

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:19.767
THESE.

01:32:19.834 --> 01:32:21.502
THAT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.738
THAT ARE TO BE SPURRED TO BE A

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:25.206
BILL TO SENIOR HOMES

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:27.642
CONDOMINIUMS ARE GOING TO BE OF

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:30.011
GREATER. ON. AVERAGE ARE GOING

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.146
TO BE OF GREATER VALUE THAN THE

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.781
HOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SOLD.

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:35.149
BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRIMARY

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.717
BENEFICIARY OF THIS INITIATIVE

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.552
RIGHT RIGHT WE'VE DONE US SOME

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:39.820
STUDIES WHERE EVEN WHEN

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:41.689
SOMEBODY'S DOWNSIZING ALBEIT TO

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:43.524
IN YOUR HOME. KNOW TIME MARCHES

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:46.193
ON IT YOU CAN JUST COST MORE AND

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.329
AND NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW MORE

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.397
BUT ENOUGH SO THAT IT PREVENTS.

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:51.599
THEM FROM DOING A TRANSFER.

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.134
BUT ISN'T IT MORE LIKELY THAT IT

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.669
WOULD BE THIS INITIATIVE WOULD

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.470
BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT

01:32:56.537 --> 01:33:00.808
TO. BUY A NICER.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.643
MORE EXPENSIVE HOME WHO OUT AND

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.879
RATHER THAN NOT NECESSARILY THAT

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.480
I DON'T THINK AGAIN THIS GOES

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:07.415
BACK TO MS BROOKS POINT THESE

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:08.416
ARE CHIU WERE WE WOULD BE

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.618
GUESSING AS TO FOCUS MOTIVATIONS.

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.186
.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:13.521
THE POINT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:14.822
ON THIS THOUGH IS IF THEY DO

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:16.057
PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.091
THE GONNA HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.426
TAXES ON THAT MORE EXPENSIVE

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:20.695
HOMES.

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.164
YEAH I I JUST DON'T SEE.

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.465
IT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:26.434
SENSE TO ME THAT IF THE PRIMARY

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.302
BENEFICIARY THE INITIATIVE. IS

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:29.603
FOR PEOPLE TO BUY A MORE

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.038
EXPENSIVE HOME BUT NO THAT'S NOT

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.606
THE PRIMARY REASON IT'S JUST I

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:34.075
ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT IS A

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.143
TECHNICAL ERROR. THAT WAS MADE

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.411
BY THE RITUAL DRAFTERS.

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:39.714
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF THERE'S YOU

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.148
CAN HAVE UP TO A TWO YEAR GAP.

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:42.750
BETWEEN SELLING YOUR HOME AND

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.151
PURCHASING YOUR HOME AND THERE'S

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.753
A FIVE PERCENT INFLATION FACTOR

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.788
PER YEAR. SO YOU CAN INFLATE

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.223
THAT WHAT YOU SOLD YOUR HOME FOR

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.558
TO RECALCULATE WHICH YOU CAN BUY

01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:51.926
FOR.

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:53.961
THAT'S THE RARE CASE WHERE

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:56.831
SOMEBODY CELLS AND THEN WAITS

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.899
TWO YEARS AND BUYS THE MORE.

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.167
YOU KNOW THE USUAL SITUATIONS

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.469
WHERE YOU BUY AND SELL

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:03.204
SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT IF YOU DO

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:04.905
THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE A DOLLAR

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:06.807
OVER YOU CAN'T DO THE TRANSFER

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:07.541
BUT YOU ADMITTED EARLIER WE

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:09.110
START OFF SAYING THAT. THE

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.211
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:11.278
CURRENT LAW AND THE PROPOSED

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.947
INITIATIVE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.582
BUYING MORE SEEKING TO BUY MARKS

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:15.916
AND OF THAT WAS DOCTOR HANS

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.218
POINT THAT THAT'S WHERE THE.

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:19.620
REVENUE WILL CALM BECAUSE RIGHT

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:20.721
NOW ALL THESE ALL THOSE FOLKS

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.890
ARE ARE ARE LOCKED DOWN OF BEING

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:24.492
ABLE TO DO A TRANSFER. WITH THIS

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.460
CHANGE WHICH FORCES THEM OR

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.496
REQUIRES THEM TO PAY ON ANY

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:31.032
INCREASE YOU KNOW ALLOW THEM TO

01:34:31.098 --> 01:34:36.604
MAKE THAT TRANSFER.

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.072
THANK YOU WE WILL HAVE THE UP

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:39.240

ONENESS THAT DYNAMIC.

01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:33.727
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

01:35:33.794 --> 01:35:35.629
NGUYEN.

01:35:35.696 --> 01:35:38.332

CITIES COUNTIES.

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:51.011
THE OFFSETS ARE STATIC.

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:53.614
THESE TRANSFER FEES AND COUNTY

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:56.250

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:58.185

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:04.458
THOUGH THEY'RE GONNA OFFSET

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.193
SLIGHTLY THE DISAPPEAR.

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:09.130
THE ONLY DYNAMIC REVENUE OFFSET

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:11.832
WAS INCREASED.

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:14.268
VALUES OF THE HOMES.

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:15.569
THERE WAS THE TALK ABOUT DRIVING

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.938
IT UP POTENTIALLY SEVEN PERCENT

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:19.406
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THE

01:36:19.473 --> 01:36:21.275
PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS.

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:23.677
TO PAY MORE FOR NEW HOMES.

01:36:23.744 --> 01:36:24.545
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IN OUR

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:25.412
INTEREST WHEN WE HAVE A HOUSING

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:26.847
CRISIS.

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:28.549
TWO SAME WERE DRIVING THE COST

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:30.351
OF HOMES UP BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:32.286
AVAILABLE TO THE SENIORS.

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:34.755
THE SPECIAL CLASS WE'VE A CREED

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.624

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:40.194
HAVING SAID THAT I GUESS THE

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.962
THE LAST CONCERN IS ABOUT

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:44.031
WINNERS AND LOSERS.

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:45.299

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.843
THERE WERE ONE THING WE DO NOW.

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.778
THERE ARE LOSERS.

BACK FILLING THE SCHOOL REVENUES.

01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:16.063

OURSELVES IN THE POST RECESSION

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.514
DID NOT SEE A DOWNTURN IN THE

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:46.220
SEEING AN UPTICK COMING OUT OF

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.421
THE BOTTOMS OF THE DEPTH THE

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:48.722

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.958
TAX TAKES. TWO TO THREE YEARS

01:38:51.025 --> 01:38:51.959
BEFORE IT ACTUALLY ENDS UP

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.427
HITTING THE LOCAL TAX ROLLS A

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:55.396
LOCAL THE LOCAL DOLLARS SO IT'S

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.964
A LITTLE BIT OF A LAG IMAGE IN

01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:58.832
BEHIND IN THAT REGARD. BUT AS WE

01:38:58.899 --> 01:39:00.401
FIND OURSELVES TODAY.

01:39:00.467 --> 01:39:02.736
SEVERAL YEARS POST RECESSION

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.638
THAT OTHERS REMAIN SIX POINT TWO

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.206
BILLION DOLLARS OF UNDERSIZED

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:08.542

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.177
SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONE SO.

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.812
THAT'S A DIFFERENCE AND SO GOING

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:12.680
INTO THE RECESSION THERE WERE

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:14.048
SIX POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.549
MORE SASS VALUE THAN THERE IS

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:16.984
NOW WITH THE PROPOSITION EIGHT

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.886
VALUE. SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE

01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:20.854
MANY OF THESE PROPERTY SOLD FOR

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.222
LESSER AMOUNT DURING THE

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.724
RECESSION SOME OF WHICH IS THE

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.259
BAY HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.428
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN VALUE TO

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:28.128
PUT THEM BACK TO THAT

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.731
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PACE. SO AS

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:32.800
A AS GOOD AS PARTNER I'M

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:33.967
INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE IN

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.769
PLACE WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.037
AS A PROPERTY DROPS IT GIVES THE

01:39:37.104 --> 01:39:38.706
TAX ASSESSOR'S THE ABILITY TO

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:41.008
LOWER THE TAX RATE. THAT SYSTEM

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.843
AB BY A I SUBMIT TO YOU IS

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.112
CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT SAID IT

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.847
BIGGEST MUCH TO THE TO STRUGGLE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.248
WITH US AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.117
WHERE AS A SPECIAL DISTRICT. AND

01:39:50.184 --> 01:39:51.785
WE MAKE UP ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.854
PERCENT OF THEM OF OUR REVENUE

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.422
BASED OFF OF PROPERTY TAX IT

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.523
WOULD BE A BIT HIGHER BUT WHERE

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.759
TRANSPORTING PARAMEDIC ENTITY.

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:02.296
AND SO WERE ABLE TO RECOVER

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:03.430
COSTS FOR PROVIDING

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.331
AMBULANCE SERVICE TO THAT HOW

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:04.998
TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.166
RESIDENTS WITHIN OUR DISTRICT.

01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:06.834
HOME BUT WITH THAT.

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.769
WITH PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.104
WERE ONLY ALLOWED TO DO A FEE

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.605
FOR SERVICE AND RECOVER OUR

01:40:11.672 --> 01:40:12.873
COSTS WE CAN'T CHARGE MORE MAKE

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.175
A PROFIT BECAUSE THEN THAT'S A

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:17.010
TAX IN AND OF ITSELF. AND SO WE

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:18.345
HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:19.880
IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND WHAT'S

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.548
AVAILABLE TO US. I'M JUST

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:22.316
KEEPING TO THE POINT I THINK

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.684
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:26.687
INTERESTING. BUT IS IS IS IS THE

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:28.389
UP UP UP PROPONENTS BROUGHT

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:29.957
FORTH IT THERE WOULD BE

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:30.557
POTENTIALLY SOME OFFSETTING

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:32.860
REVENUE SUCHAS CAPITAL GAINS

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:35.295
TAXES TRANSFER TAXES INCOME TAX

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.430
AND SALES AND USE TAX.

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.331
WELL I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:38.732
ONLY TAX OF MY DISTRICT IS

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:40.134
ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE TO BE ABLE

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.602
TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:43.237
COMMUNITY IS PROPERTY TAX NONE

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.205
OF THOSE OTHER TAXES. ROLL DOWN

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:46.907
TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS OR THE

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:48.409
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT REGARD

01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:49.843
AND SO THIS WOULD TRULY BE AN

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.980
OFFSET MAYBE. AT THE END AND AND

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:53.781
AS I THINK WE'VE LEARNED TODAY

01:40:53.847 --> 01:40:55.482
THAT THERE'S NO YOU KNOW THAT IT

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:56.784
THERE SOME REALLY HEAR SOME GOOD

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:57.751
WORK IT'S GOING INTO A BUT WE

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.086
REALLY NEVER NEVER. WE REALLY

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:00.854
DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL LOOK

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.456
LIKE ON THE END BUT WHAT I CAN

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:03.991
SAY IS EVEN IF IT'S A NET ZERO

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:05.259
SUM GAME AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:06.593

CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

01:41:23.844 --> 01:41:24.678

BRIEF AND REALLY WANT RESPOND

TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.318
RAISED I'M DURING THE PROPONENTS

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:33.754
TESTIMONY AND FIRST ONE TO START

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.456
BY ECHOING THE CONCERN THAT

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:37.224
MAYBE STATEWIDE THIS WHEN THAT

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.026
OUT BUT REGION'S. AND COUNTY BY

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:40.661
COUNTY ISSUES REMAIN AND THAT'S

01:41:40.727 --> 01:41:41.628
LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS NEW

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:43.130
EXPANSION OF THE PROP NINETY

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.799
ALLOWANCE SO LINE ONE COUNTIES A

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:47.568
TAX BILL TO MOVE TO ANOTHER. AND

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:48.769
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TROUBLING AND

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.270
WE DO HAVE ELEVEN COUNTIES

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:52.172
CURRENTLY THEY'LL PROVIDE THE

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.975
PROP NINETY PERMISSION. LARGELY

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.743
A WEE WEE HOURS I'VE SPOKEN TO

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.045
EARLIER THAT THESE ARE WEALTHY

01:41:58.111 --> 01:41:58.946
COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT SEEN A

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.914
PROBLEM. COVER EL DORADO COUNTY

01:42:00.981 --> 01:42:02.182
JUST LAST FALL BUT IT AND

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.650
THEY'RE PROP NINETY PROGRAM

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.085
BECAUSE THEY WERE SEEN HALF A

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:05.819
MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:07.754
TAXES LOSS FOR THE COUNTY THE

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:09.456
CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.091
TO SAY THAT EVERY PROP NINETY

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:13.126
COUNTY IS A HAPPY WEALTHY COUNTY

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.028
WITH POSITIVE OUTCOMES.

01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:17.164
THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE I ALSO

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:18.832
WANT TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF A

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:19.833
HOUSING BRIEFLY.

01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:23.036
DESPITE THE SORT OF.

01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:24.805
.

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:25.772
AT. THAT CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT WE

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:27.207
WOULD HOPE COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN

01:42:27.274 --> 01:42:29.343
BEST CASE SCENARIO. THIS MEASURE

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:30.677
WILL NOT BUILD A SINGLE

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:32.179
ADDITIONAL UNIT IT WOULD NOT

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:33.814
PROTECT A SINGLE A FOR A HOUSING

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.249
UNIT. AND WOULD NOT HELP

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.050
HOMEOWNERS OR SIMPLY PRICED OUT

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:39.953
OF OF THE MARKET AND SO WE THINK

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.121
TO SAY THAT THIS IS A.

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:43.323
REMEDY OR A SOLUTION TO THE

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:45.859
HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:46.994
SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUS.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.596
AND THEN FINALLY THE IDEA OF THE

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.431
PRETTY CLOSE ESTIMATES.

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:54.201
THE THOUGHT THAT THERE COULD BE

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:56.270
A REVENUE NEUTRAL OUTCOME.

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:57.804
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ARE

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.306
CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:01.275
SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE QUALITY

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:02.776
OF LIFE PROVIDERS CAN YOU CAN

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:04.311
BANK ON THAT'S NOT HOW COUNTY

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.346
BUDGETS ARE MADE AND SO. THE

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:08.282
RISK HERE WOULD NEVER FALL TO

01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:09.216
THE PROPONENTS OF IT FALLS

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.984
SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:12.252
COUNTIES OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS OF

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:13.654
CITIES.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:23.730
OF THE STATE FOR THOSE REVENUE

01:43:23.797 --> 01:43:24.331
LOSSES AND THAT IS FAR TOO BIG

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:29.836
OF A.

01:43:29.903 --> 01:43:31.572
THAT'S SOMETHING.

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:33.774
I'M ALRIGHT.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:50.290
WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:53.760

SINGLE LEVEL OR THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:31.058
THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I

01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:33.160
HEAR FROM SENIOR CLIENTS.

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:34.795
THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM SELLING

01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:36.663
THEIR HOME IS THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:37.698
A SPIKE IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX

01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:38.432

WHO ARE SENIORS TO MOVE TO

01:45:52.746 --> 01:45:53.647
SMALLER HOMES?

MOVING PENALTY THIS IS

01:45:57.684 --> 01:45:58.218
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

THOUSAND MEMBERS.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:11.064

01:46:11.131 --> 01:46:12.499
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WHERE SENIORS

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.534

EASILY MOVE A LOT OF THEM ARE ON

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.604
FIXED INCOMES. A LOT OF THEM

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.606
DON'T HAVE THE SAME ABILITY THAT

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.174
YOUNGER COUNTERPARTS DO.

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:23.577

THAT.

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:26.413
ARE DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO BE AND

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.148

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:47.234
DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY THEY HAVE

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.135
PLUMBING LEAKS THEY HAVE ROOF

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:50.270
