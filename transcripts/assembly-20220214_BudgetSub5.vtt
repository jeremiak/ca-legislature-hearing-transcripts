SO THAT THE POSITIONS WERE

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:50.507
REDUCED AND THEN INSTEAD OF

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.909

SPECTOR RECTOR OF HEALTH CARE

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:06.362
SERVICES. I THINK THE ONLY

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.664
THINGS I WOULD ADD TO THAT ARE-

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.500
FOR ALL NEW CONTRACTORS THERE'S

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.368
AN EXPECTATION THAT THEY WILL

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.337
BE. VACCINATED WHEN THEY START

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.072
WITH US OR HAVE BEEN APPROVED

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.974
ACCOMMODATION. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.642
THAT WE FOUND AS WE'VE GONE

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.411
THROUGH OUR LIST IS THAT. WE

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.146
HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.314
INDIVIDUALS LISTED IN VARIOUS

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:27.517
INSTITUTIONS CONTRACTORS. WHO

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.485
MIGHT BE COMING IN QUARTERLY

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.421
SEMI ANNUALLY ANNUALLY THE

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.989
SERVICE AREA WHERE VARIOUS

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.324
EQUIPMENT FOR EXAMPLE. OR THEY

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.727
MAY HAVE AND- ARE SERVICING A

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:38.795
GREAT MENTOR PROVIDING SOME

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.730
SERVICE IN THE PAST AND REALLY.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.465
HAVE NOT BEEN ANY INSTITUTION IN

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.233
QUITE SOME TIME. SO WE'VE

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.102
INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.770
ENERGY IN ENSURING THAT THOSE

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:50.206
LISTS ARE CURRENT. AND I BELIEVE

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:51.774
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:54.010
OUR NUMBERS. ONE OTHER THING I

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.311
WOULD ADD TO WHAT DIRECTOR

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.214
GIPSON SAID IS THAT. YES FOR THE

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.049
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.218
CLASSIFICATIONS IN. POLITICAL

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:04.620
AND CUSTODY. OUR VACCINATION

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.923
RATES YOUR PASS. WHAT'S FOUND

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.925
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALSO IN

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.327
CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT DOESN'T

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.328
MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.730
CONTINUE TO OFFER. AND ENCOURAGE

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.666
AND EDUCATE PEOPLE WE DO KNOW

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.568
THAT THOSE WHO ARE VACCINATED.

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.470
ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET INFECTED

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.305
LESS LIKELY TO TRANSMIT TO

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.073
OTHERS AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.676
LESS LIKELY TO. BE HOSPITALIZED

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:29.479
OR SUFFER SEVERE CONSEQUENCES

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.414
OF. BEING INFECTED SO WE'RE

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.316
GOING TO CONTINUE TO TARGET ALL

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:38.087
OF OUR. UNVACCINATED RESIDENTS

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:40.056

JUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE US WITH

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.328
UPDATES- LIKE I SAID I DO ONE OF

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.496
THE KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRESS THAT

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:47.530
HAS BEEN MADE VOTE. WE HAVE SOME

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.931
PROGRESS TO CONTINUE ON

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.566
ESPECIALLY AS WE WANT TO KEEP

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.335
BOTH STAFF AND MADE SAFE AND THE

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.536
SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS WELL WE

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.138
KNOW THAT AN OUTBREAK. THE

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.973
PRESENT OFTENTIMES THESE TOPICS

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.141
IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:02.378
AS WELL- COLLEAGUES QUESTION TH.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.946
MISTER JONES SAWYER. CONNECTION

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:06.482
JUST KIND OF CURIOUS- OBVIOUS

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:08.951
I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED INTO. IN

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.720
SOME WAYS WHEN THE COMMAND CDCR.

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.855
ON GETTING THE VACCINATION RATES

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.658
UP SO HIGH- IN SOME WAYS IT'S

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.059
REALLY REMARKABLE FROM WHAT I

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.362
WAS HEARING EARLIER. AND AND

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:21.430
KEEPING IT YOU KNOW 15% EIGHTY

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:24.100
PERCENT. OF IT REALLY REALLY

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.335
GOOD. THE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:29.172
COMING IN IS IT KIND OF. AND

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.606
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE GLOBAL

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:34.277
TRYING TO GET A SENSE. OF WHY.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:35.745
THEY DON'T WANT WHAT ARE THEY

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.113
TELLING YOU WHY THEY'RE NOT

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.149
GETTING VACCINATED. AMADOR IS

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.051
THE THING WHICH YOU JUST SAID A

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:43.419
MATTER OF FREQUENCY THEY'RE IN

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.621
THERE SO INFREQUENT THAT THEY

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.990
MAY NOT BELIEVE THEY NEED TO BE

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:51.494
VACCINATED- IS THERE RATIONALE

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.229
IS IT IS IT INFORMATION THAT

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.897
THEY'RE GETTING THAT TELLS THEM

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:55.898
FROM THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:59.035
NEED. OR THEY DON'T NEED TO BE

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.771
VACCINATED EVEN THOUGH OF THE

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:04.574
STATE EMPLOYEES LOOK LIKE

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.908
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:12.548
. TRYING TO COMPLY. DID ANYONE I

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.784
THINK IT'S A MIXTURE OF ALL OF

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.352
THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.687
ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.789
LEARNED THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC IS

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.257
FOR A LARGE ORGANIZATION LIKE

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.593
THIS TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:25.127
LISTING OF EVERY SINGLE

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.796
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COMING IN AND

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.764
OUT OF ONE OF YOUR INSTITUTIONS

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.866
CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING IT'S

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:33.803
SUCH A LARGE- SERVICE THAT THAT

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.505
IS PROVIDED AND SO- I CAN'T SIT

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.507
HERE AND SAY THAT WHAT CERTAIN

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.509
PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTRACTORS

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:41.944
ARE NOT INTERESTED IN BEING

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.981
VACCINATED. OR NOT BUT I THINK

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.249
THAT BY THE TIME WE GET THROUGH

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.917
THIS PROCESS WE'LL FIND IT THEIR

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.952
ACCEPTANCE IN DECLINATION RATE

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:52.054
IS PROBABLY MORE LINKED TO THE

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.856
ACCOUNT TEAM WHICH THEY MAY HAVE

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.225
BEEN THEIR CLASSIFICATION AS

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:59.262
WE'RE SEEING WITH CALIFORNIANS

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.764
ALL OVER THE STATE. I GUESS I

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:04.267
WAS ASKING ANY SPECIFIC. THAT

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.402
THE BACKS IN VACCINATIONS DON'T

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.704
WORK THAT. YOU COULD CAUSE MORE

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:12.041
PROBLEMS AS A MULTIPLIER. OR I

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:14.944
JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND YOU

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:15.878
CAN MAKE ME. A FRONTRUNNER GET

01:05:15.945 --> 01:05:19.315
TO. WELL DIRECTOR GIPSON MAY

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.417
HAVE- IT DISHMAN FORMATION ON

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.718
THIS BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:26.489
FULL RANGE OF. OPINIONS AMONG

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.556
BOTH THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.692
PRISON. ONE SECOND VERY

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.861
IMPRESSED BY IS HOW PEOPLE ARE

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.429
MAKING DECISIONS BASED UPON

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.131
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PERCEIVED

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:38.134
RISK FACTORS AND BY THAT I MEAN.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.735
ARE AMONG OUR RESIDENTS FOR

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:42.138
EXAMPLE ME VERY INFORMED

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.406
DECISIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.041
ACCEPTANCE RATE AMONG THOSE WHO

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.909
ARE ELDERLY HAVE MULTIPLE

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:49.712
COMORBIDITIES. WHO ARE MOST AT

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.414
RISK FOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.616
THEY'VE ACCEPTED THIS VACCINE AT

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.185
A RATE OF OVER NINETY PERCENT.

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.321
EXCEPT MISTER IS THAT OVER 80%

01:05:58.387 --> 01:06:00.289
AND THIS IS A POPULATION THAT

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.825
HAS NEVER ACCEPTED A VACCINE IN

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:03.759
OUR SYSTEM THAT MORE THAN SIXTY

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:05.294
PERCENT. SO I'VE BEEN VERY

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.063
IMPRESSED AND I THINK OUR

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.465
EMPLOYEES ARE DOING SIMILAR RISK

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:11.734
CALCULATIONS BASED UPON THEIR

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.736
SELF PERCEPTION OF RISK. IN

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:17.973
WHERE THEY GET. THEIR NEWS AND

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.008
THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA. OKAY IN A

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.009
RESERVE ASK IS A BE TRANS. TO

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.344
THE STATE AS A WHOLE I MEAN IF

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.112
YOU'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL. AT A

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.914
POPULATION THAT MAY BE A LITTLE

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.382
RETICENT TO DO THIS IN YOUR

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.784
RATES ARE THIS HIGH. IT COULD BE

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.386
APPLICABLE TO REST THE

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.088
CALIFORNIA OF BEING ABLE TO DO

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.823
SO THAT'S- KIND OF WHAT I'M

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.725
ASKING I KNOW IT'S A MICROCOSM

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.027
OF THE STATE. BUT IT COULD BE A

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:41.731
GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN GET

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:42.331
MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED. THANK

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:45.801

NINETEEN MANAGEMENT ARE STILL

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.748
UNKNOWN AND UNPREDICTABLE WHAT'S

01:06:58.814 --> 01:06:59.882
THE ARGUMENT FOR THE

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.418
APPROPRIATION THAT STATED HERE

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:08.924

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.106
IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH YOUR

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.913
A LARGE VOLUME FIFTY FIVE

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.814
THOUSAND PEOPLE TRYING TO TRACK

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.417
EVERYBODY DOWN. THEY'RE WORKING-

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.018
YOUR DIFFERENT SHIPS DIFFERENT

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:45.287
DAYS SOME IN THE INSTITUTION A

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.889
DAY A MONTH TWO DAYS A MONTH

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.958
ONCE A QUARTER. IT CAN BE

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:51.460
CHALLENGING DURING THAT SO- I

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:53.229
DON'T THINK IT'S A PARTICULAR

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.264
PROBLEM TO THE CONTRACTORS. DO

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.033
YOU THINK YOU YOU MADE A REALLY

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.235
GOOD POINT THAT- HAS LA

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.769
SOMETIMES PEOPLE'S OPINIONS HAVE

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.304
LESS TO DO WITH THEIR-

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.939
CLASSIFICATION OR WHAT THEY'RE

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.140
DOING AT A PARTICULAR PLACE

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:06.442
VERSES WHERE THEY'RE WHERE

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:07.109
THEY'RE LIVING IN THEIR

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.578
COMMUNITY. SO BASED ON THAT

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.981
COMMENT- THE PEOPLE WHO I

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.449
IMAGINE ARE IN CHARGE OF

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:15.684

DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT FRANTICALLY

01:09:26.061 --> 01:09:29.331
PLEASED WITH. HOW MUCH SENIOR

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:30.266
CUSTOMER EITHER SHIP AS IN

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.668
BRACED. VACCINATIONS WHEN WE

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:16.918
REALLY COVERED EVERYTHING FROM

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:18.653
FROM THE LEAST AREAS TO THE MOST

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.556
SERIOUS IN THAT THE DEFINITION.

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:23.991
BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.293
THERE WAS A VAST AMOUNT OF

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.627
CONCERN WITH THE WORK THAT WAS

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:29.030
BEING DONE LOCALLY WE'VE ELECTED

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:31.699
EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS LESS

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.634
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ARE GOING

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.336
BACK TO THE INSTITUTIONS. THEY

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.171
WILL HAVE TO BE REVIEWED BY A

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:38.773

ALLEGATION INVESTIGATION UNIT.

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.182

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.656
THAT THEY'RE DOING FOR THE

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.058
INVESTIGATIONS BEING DONE BY

THEIR TEAM WE REALLY FEEL THAT

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:00.928
THIS WILL MITIGATE THE CONCERNS

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:03.631
OF- WORK QUALITY FROM THE

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:07.568

AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING CENTER

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:35.503
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ON THE

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:37.505
HEALTHCARE SIDE. I'M PART OF

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:40.274
EQT'S ROLE IS TO EVALUATE THE

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.276
EVIDENCE OBTAINED DURING THE

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.844
COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION. AND

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:45.146
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.048
WHETHER OR NOT ALLEGATIONS OF

01:34:47.114 --> 01:34:50.351
MISCONDUCT. SHOULD BE SUSTAINED

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.886
OR NOT. I EXISTING. WHICH WILL

01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:54.288
CARRY OVER INTO THE NEW PROCESS

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:56.490
SHOULD HIRING AUTHORITY ACT IN A

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:59.026
MANNER THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH

01:34:59.093 --> 01:35:00.828
OUR POLICIES AND OUR PRACTICES.

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:01.896
THE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.764
SUPERVISORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:05.533
ELEVATE THE HIRING AUTHORITIES

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:08.269
THE WARDENS OR CVS DECISION. TO

01:35:08.335 --> 01:35:10.371
THE NEXT HIGHEST LEVEL. AND SO

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:12.406
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:13.074
FURTHER REVIEW AND

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.709
CONSIDERATION. OF ANY ISSUES

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:19.113
WHERE IT PTC'S I HAVE A DENTAL

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.782
PROBLEM WITH HELLO- WHARTON OR

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:24.418
CEO IS IMPOSING DISCIPLINE OR

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:27.621
SUSTAINING ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:28.489
THE SAME ALLEGATIONS. I THINK

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.724
ONE OF THE OTHER BENEFITS TO

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:32.927
THIS NEW PROCESS AND IN TERMS OF

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:34.662
HELPING WITH THIS THE PLAN AND

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:36.464
THAT PROCESS AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:38.766
WATER SUSTAINING ALLEGATIONS. IS

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:41.035
THAT WITH MORE INFORMATION COMES

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:42.736
MORE CONFIDENT IN MAKING A

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:44.538
DECISION FOR THE HIRING

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.740
AUTHORITY FOR THE WORKING SO

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.175
BECAUSE SO MANY MORE OF THESE

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.810
CASES WILL BE INVESTIGATED THE

01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:51.445
ONLY BE WARDENS WILL HAVE MORE

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:53.347
INFORMATION UPON WHICH THEY CAN

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:55.382
ACT. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE

01:35:55.449 --> 01:35:57.585
WILL BE I'M ORGANISTS LIKELY

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:58.752
THAT THERE WILL BE A VERY

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.888
POSITIVE IMPACT ON ADDRESSING

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:02.156
DISCIPLINARY MATTERS AND

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:04.091
ADDRESSING MISCONDUCT BECAUSE

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:05.593
THE WARDENS AND THE CEOS WILL

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:06.961
HAVE ALL OF THE NECESSARY

01:36:07.027 --> 01:36:09.363
INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.865
OR NOT SUSTAIN AN ALLEGATION

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:12.600
BECAUSE THE CASE WILL HAVE AN

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:15.836
INVESTIGATIVE. BY AN

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:19.974
INVESTIGATOR. SO I AT THIS WILL

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:21.108
BE MY LAST COMMENT ACTUALLY IS

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.343
NOT A QUESTION FAILING TO GIVE

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.377
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.912
WHO I KNOW ARE CHOMPING AT THE

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.580
BIT FOR QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:29.717
SAY THAT HAPPY MORE INFORMATION.

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:30.951
IS NOT ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:32.520
WE'RE CHANGING THE CULTURE A LOT

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:33.821
OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OVER

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.289
TIME HAS BEEN ABOUT THE CULTURE

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:37.558
AND HE'S TO BE CHANGED. I AND SO

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.861
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT. THE

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:43.197
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS ENOUGH

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:44.765

THEY CONCERNED WITH WITH- THE

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.666
DIFFERENT STEPS IN ORDER TO BE

OTHER THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:15.782
CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT TRACKS

STATEWIDE EVALUATE THAT DATA.

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.033
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO USE THAT

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.968
DATA TO ESTABLISH WHAT WE ARE

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.737
