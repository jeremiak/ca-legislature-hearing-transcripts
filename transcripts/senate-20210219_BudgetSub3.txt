BUT NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO HIS DEPUTY COOPER- PRESS THREE COVERT AND DEDICATIONS. ONE SECOND I THINK DOCTOR PAN HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE YES- I UNDERSTAND- SO WE'RE STILL AN ISSUE I SOUNDS LIKE THIS. WE'RE MOVING IT ISSUE TO READY SO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AROUND JUST THE OVERVIEW. WE WERE MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. DIRECTOR WE WERE GOING TO BUT I I'M SORRY I. OKAY OF COURSE TO SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS OKAY THERE MUST ADDRESS. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- DIRECTOR LIKE PORN AND- AND YOU KNOW REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT. I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVER YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU MENTIONED- THAT WE'RE TALKING YEAH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE EIGHT CS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. SIX WITH A B. DOLLAR BUDGET SO- OFTENTIMES SWINGS AND DH CS OF SOMEONE'S CHAIRED THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WE'RE SITTING HERE DEBATING LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR EVEN A HUNDRED MILLION BUT YOU CAN HAVE A SWING AT DH CS OF. THE EARLY FRACTIONS OF PERCENT WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WOULD TALK ABOUT BILLION DOLLARS SO. I DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS REGARDING- SOME OF THE- FUN DETAILS- UNDER REIMBURSEMENTS- AGAIN TALKING ABOUT SWEET FOR BILLIONS- A BILLION SO WE HAVE- IN THIS FISCAL YEAR TO. TWO POINT THREE BILLION AND THEN IT GOES DOWN TO BASELINE OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION PROJECTED BUDGET- CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT. WHAT THE- BASICALLY ONE FROM ONE POINT FOUR BILLION TO TWO POINT THREE BACK TO ONE POINT THREE BILLION IS PROJECTED FOR THE NEXT YEAR- IS THAT CAN JUST A BRIEF EXPLANATION AS TO THE BILLION DOLLAR BUMP. UP ON THE REIMBURSEMENT LINE- UNDER THE OTHER FINE DETAIL. J. C. DO YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT- OF WE WERE GOING TO COVER SOME OF THE SWINGS AND THE- LOCAL ASKED MEANT BUT I THINK THE MAIN PIECE I WOULD SAY IS A DRIVING FACTOR TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS GOING TO BE A LOWER PROJECTION OF CASELOAD INCREASE- YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO SEE AN INCREASE PROJECTION FOR. F. MAP SERVICES- AS WELL AS- REDUCE ESTIMATES FOR OUR SPEAK ONLY CLAIMING THAT WAS- ANNOUNCED- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- AND THEN YOU'LL ALSO SEE SOME ITEMS REGARDING THE MAN'S CARE EXTENDED BILE- CORRECTION- AND THERE'S ALSO LATER I WILL KIND OF WALK THROUGH THE VARIOUS WINGS- AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE BUDGET I'M TO CALL HELP HIGHLIGHT. THANK YOU SAID. I BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET CAN BE YOU KNOW A 1% SWING BUT THERE ARE USUALLY- BIG FACTORS THAT DRIVE THOSE GAINS. BETTER YEAH SOME SORT OF- BUT JUST IN TERMS OF ON THE OVERVIEW SIDE THERE'S A LINE CALLED REIMBURSEMENTS- NINE NINE FIVE AND THERE'S A BILLION DOLLAR. SWINGING ROUGHLY- NINE HUNDRED MILLION- THE EFFORT THIS YEAR UPWARD AND THEN THIS PROJECTED TO BACK DOWN. DO WE KNOW WHAT THAT BILLION DOLLARS IS ABOUT. R. NINE HUNDRED MILLION TO BE MORE ACCURATE. I WOULD HAVE TO I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT BREAK. I WOULD ASSUME IT'S PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH THE STATE ONLY CLEANING ADJUSTMENTS WHICH YOU HAVE OVER AND UNDER CLAIMING WEBER DRYING DOWN ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT I WOULD ASSUME THE MAJORITY OF THAT'S FALLING OKAY NOW. AND THEN THE COSCO QUALITY ASSURANCE REVENUE FUND YEAH AND IT WENT FROM TWO POINT NINE BILLION TO FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION AND IS PROJECTED TO GO DOWN TO THREE POINT. NINE BILLION- SO IS- THERE'S A REASON FOR THE EXTRA BUMP FOR. THIS YEAR AND IT'S AGAIN IS THAT GOING FROM TWO POINT NINE UP TO FIVE POINT FOUR DOWN TO THREE POINT. NINE SO- THIS DOES THE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE REVENUE FUND DO IT IS THERE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE BETTER SWINGS THERE. YEAH THAT THAT WOULD NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HAS HAD- SOME IMPACTS ON THE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE BUT LET ME SEE IF ON WENDY HARRINGTON- ONCE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAIL AROUND- THAT EXACT SWING THAT YOU'RE SEEING- BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. OKAY I'M ON A HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSURANCE FEE I'M A LOT OF IT ACTUALLY ALSO COMES DOWN TO JUST A CASH BASIC AS MEDIKAL ESTIMATE OKAY AND SO- FROM A TINY PERSPECTIVE OF WHEN WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING THEIR DEMANDS I'M OUT YOU CAN CARP WEEK FROM YEAR TO YEAR- BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING MORE PAYMENTS IN ONE YEAR THAN YOU WILL IN THE NEXT YEAR. EVEN THOUGH IT IS. IF HI OF WHEN PAYMENTS ACTUAL OCCUR OKAY YEAH I WELL I JUST MAKING WHEN WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT EVEN IF THE OVERALL BUDGET SOMETHING THAT. GOES A BILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW CATCHES NOTICED SO- SO A DEAL IS MADE OKAY NEED A CATCH TINY ISSUE BUT- WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE WANT TO FUND AND- THE L. MEDI CAL SWINGS A BILLION HERE AND THERE. SO I TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND THEN- ON THEM I KNOW THE MEDICO DRUG REBATE. FUND IS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW. TURNS AROUND AND IT'S TO. UP NO THAT CENTER- SO. HOW WE HAVE HERE IT'S A SO WE'RE- FOR THIS PAST YEARS ABOUT ONE AND A HALF BILLION. NEXT YEAR IS ABOUT THE SAME BUT- WE I KNOW WE TOOK SOME STEPS TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE SUCH LARGE SWINGS IN THE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE FUNDS SO WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT NEXT YEAR IT WOULD ACTUALLY. BE AROUND THAT RANGE VERSUS NOW IT HAS A PRICES UNFORTUNATELY USUALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING BACK. AND HAVING A HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ON OUR BUDGET. YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW- AS HISTORICALLY IT IF YOU CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO ESTIMATE REBATES BECAUSE- OF THE RETROSPECTIVE NATURE. OF THEM AND- VARIOUS POLICIES THAT DRIVE WHAT WE DO AND DON'T GET REBATES ON- SO I SAY WE DO OUR BEST TO ESTIMATE THE REBATES- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIMINGS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF REBATES. ON THAT COME IN AND INSTANCE WE ARE ON A CASH BASIS. WE DO HAVE TO TREAT THOSE UP ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THAT YES IT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE BUT AGREE THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS MADE WITHIN THE BUDGET TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO- TO NOT HAVE THOSE SWINGS- ON THE REBATES I. OKAY WELL JUST MAKE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW WE WENT FROM. IN THE PRIOR YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FOR A NEGATIVE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TO ONE POINT FOUR NINE. ONE TWO ONE FIVE BILLION SO YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW THAT'S- AGAIN THAT'S A ONE HALF BILLION DOLLAR SWING AND COURSE NEXT YEAR WE'RE PROJECTING. ON A REVENUE PLUS YOU KNOW- I GUESS RESIDENTS PLUS ONE POINT FOUR OR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ROUGHLY I'M JUST ROUNDING- SO GOING FROM THE SENSUALLY WE HAVE TO PAY MONEY INTO WHAT EXPECTING. AND THEN FINALLY- THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SPECIAL FUNDS WHICH GOES FROM ZERO TO TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AND THEN IS PROJECTED BUDGETED FOR TWO AND A HALF BILLION I CAN YOU RAINY WHAT THAT FUND IS. AGAIN HEALTHCARE SERVICES SPECIAL FUNDS THREE THREE THREE FOUR. I DO NOT HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE DOCK COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK TO THAT YEAH WE CAN GET BACK TO DOES. THIS FINANCING WILL TO. TODAY UP JUST. CENTER YEAH AND THIS IS RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ACTUALLY AND I WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE DRUG REBATE I'M JUST REALLY CORRECTLY I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THE REASON YOU'RE SEEING SUCH A KIND OF AN ODD PATTERN WITH THAT PHONE. I HAS TO DO WITH- AS YOU PROBABLY RECALL WE CREATED THE FUND- IN NINETEEN TWENTY AS A TOOL TO TRY TO MANAGE THE VOLATILITY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- IN THE MALAKAL ESTIMATE AND SO TE FIRST YEAR THERE WE HAD INITIALLY DEPOSITED- OR OR MAINTAINED A SMALL RESERVES THAT WE'VE BEEN LEADERS USE TO OFFSET WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN- OTHERWISE A LARGER GENERAL FUND. SWING SO I SUSPECT THAT THAT. HAS TO DO WITH THAT- AND- I'M LOOKING UP THE FUND RIGHT NOW DOES ANYBODY ON MY TEAM HAVE THAT INFORMATION- TO THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SPECIAL FUND THREE THREE THREE FOUR. YEAH I THINK IT'S THE I THINK IT'S THE NEW MCO TAXES AND SALES TAX OKAY YEAH AND SO THE REASON THAT YOU KNOW THE GOING FROM ZERO TO SUCH A LARGE- EXPENDITURE FIGURE WOULD BE BECAUSE IT LOOKS THE TAX STARTED COMING IN IN THE CURRENT- SORRY. OKAY WHEN I JUST WANT TO KNOW OKAY ALEX TELL ME TO MCOT THAT. NOW I KNOW WHAT IT IS. OKAY THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE THOSE EXPLANATIONS- I JUST I JUST MAKE NOTE THAT AS WE DO OUR BUDGETING HERE- AND I REALIZED AGAIN I WANTED IN CONTEXT WITH A BUDGET A HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION. YOU KNOW OF BILLION DOLLARS IS STILL LESS THAN 1% BUT- YOU KNOW I OFTENTIMES WERE CONSIDERING ISSUES WHERE PEOPLE ARE REALLY ASKING DOUBT LIKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS EVEN A MILLION AND SUDDENLY. YEAH I BILLION DOLLARS SWING. HAS CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON DECISIONS WERE MAKING ABOUT SERVICES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT- WE- YOU KNOW DEBATING INVENTORS OF HELPING PEOPLE. WHEN THEY'RE TALKING SKILLS OF MILLIONS OR EVEN TENS OF MILLIONS YOU KNOW THAT BILLION SO ME BEING. FROM ONE YEAR TO ANOTHER. CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT JUST TO RECOGNIZE THOSE RECOGNIZE THAT AND THE BILL UNDERSTAND. HOW THESE SWINGS HAPPENED AND ALSO RECOGNIZE IN TERMS OF THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL MEDICAL BUDGET. IT'S A VERY SMALL PORTION. BUT IT DOES HAVE SOMETIMES AN OUTSIZED IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER CERTAIN SERVICES IN THE RIGHT. PLACES IN THE BUDGET THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING IN THAT MORE AS THE PRESENTATIONS GO ON. A CENTER MELINDA'S. NOW I'M GET MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY I THINK WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. SO AT DH CS IT RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE REQUESTED CLOSE TO SIXTY OR SEVENTY OF FLEXIBILITIES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- AND LEVERAGE VARIOUS FEDERAL- WAIVERS AND DISASTER- ABILITIES TO MAKE THOSE FLEXIBILITIES HAPPENED. A BIT CLUED A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ALLOWED FOR US TO QUICKLY MOVE- DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. INCLUDING FLEXIBILITIES AROUND STATE FAIR HEARINGS BENEFITS- EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH. RATES ARE AND VARIETY OF OTHER KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITIES DURING THAT TIME PERIOD- WE ISSUED NOTICES TO ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THERE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT THEY- HAD BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO THEY UNDERSTOOD. HOW THEY COULD BE RECEIVING HEALTH CARE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE ALSO LAUNCHED A TWENTY SEVEN A NURSE LINE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER DONE AT MEDIC CAL A FOR ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THAT INCLUDED THE UNINSURED. FOR THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NURSE LINE MAKING SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD WHERE THEY COULD GO FOR TESTING AS WELL IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING KOBE NINETEEN- AND DIRECTING THEM TO THEIR MANAGED CARE PLAN IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE A MANAGED CARE PLAN- INDIVIDUAL AND ARE WE TRACKING HOW DO WE KNOW OF WAS IT WILL USED. IT HAS BEEN USED- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT STATS IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF CALLS WE ARE ABLE TO- CONNECT THEM WITH THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO WERE UNINSURED GET THEM ENROLLED INTO MEDIC CAL- AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A DECK THAT WE CAN SEND YOU IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF CALLS THE TYPES OF CALLS- AND HOW WE HAVE UTILIZED AT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NURSE LINE AND HOW HOW WELL WE- HAVE- ADVERTISER PUT THE WORD OUT TO THE PUBLIC. THAT THAT THAT LINE IS THERE AND AVAILABLE. SO IN THAT NOTICE THAT I WAS REFERENCE. WE PUT THE INFORMATION IN THAT BENEFITS YOUR NOSE THAT WENT UP TO THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES- SO THAT THEY HAD THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE LINE WE HAVE IT. ON OUR WEBSITE WE DO A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND WE HAVE PROVIDED IT TO ALL OF OUR ADVOCACY GROUPS OF THE PEOPLE KNOW- HOW TO REACH US AND GET INFORMATION IF THEY NEED IT. ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S EIGHT SO THAT ADVOCACY GROUPS THEN WILL BE CONTACTING THOSE WHO ARE NOT. OTHERWISE COVERED BY MEDICARE THAT THEY THEY WERE ELIGIBLE. CORRECT AND EVEN THOSE WITH MEDICARE CAN USE IF YOU FOR SERVICE OR MANAGED CARE WE WILL. PROVIDE SERVICES TO ANYONE WHO CALLS THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. FOR I'M- ALSO DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE STARTED TRACKING UTILIZATION TRENDS VERY EARLY- AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT. REDUCTION IN UTILIZATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS OUTPATIENT VISITS. AS WELL AS CHILDREN IMMUNIZATION RATES AND WE HAVE BEEN- CONSISTENTLY SINCE MAY OF THIS YEAR. A PARTNERING WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD. A RE ENGAGE AND HEALTHCARE- THEY SHOULD BE GETTING IN FOR IMMUNIZATION RATES AND WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN POSTING DASHBOARDS. THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE UTILIZATION TRENDS IN MEDIC HOW- AND REALLY GETTING. ESPECIALLY CHILDREN. A BACKEND FOR IMMUNIZATIONS AND WELL CHILD VISITS WHERE WE HAD CERTAIN PARTS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. FOR UTILIZATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND WE- ARE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE TO GET THAT WORD OUT- WHEN IT COMES TO ELIGIBILITY- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S TRACKING IN IN MEDIC HOW- WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS COVERAGE REQUIREMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- SO. FOR THE MAJORITY OF THAT NO ONE CAN BE DISTANT ROLLED FROM THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN ORDER FOR US TO CONTINUE RECEIVING THE ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCH- FROM CMS- THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS. TO THAT BUT THE MAJORITY IS A CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS- WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED FOR OUR A CHIP INDIVIDUALS WE WAIVE THE PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING- DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WENT IN IMMEDIATELY UPON DECLARATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I'M IN SOMETHING WE COMMONLY DO- WHEN WE HAD EVEN JUST STATE DECLARED EMERGENCIES- WE IMPLEMENTED THE OPTIONAL UNINSURED COVERAGE ELIGIBILITY GROUPS OF SOMEONE WHO WAS UNINSURED HAS THE ABILITY TO ENROLL. UP WITH DH CS TO HAVE COVERAGE FOR TESTING TESTING RELATED SERVICES IN KOBE TREATMENTS- DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WE HAVE HAD OVER NINETY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND ROLL AND THAT UNINSURED COVERAGE GROUP TO DATE- AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE COVERAGE THROUGH. THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WE ALSO TO IN THAT THAT WERE UTILIZING CARE THROUGH HOSPITALS- HAD EXPANDED ACCESS TO PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY. SO WE EXPANDED OUR HOSPITAL PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY DID TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER- BECAUSE OF THE- IMPACT THEY WERE HAVING DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE FELT THAT WAS. CRITICAL WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED IN A LOT FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE. YOU PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY PERIODS WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH TIME FRAME FIRST IS THE PREVIOUS ONE PERIOD- THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS ROLE- WE ALSO ALLOWED FOR A NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITIES TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT TO ENSURE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. INCLUDING APPLICATION OF FLEXIBILITIES FOR SIGNATURES AND TELEPHONIC ENROLLMENT IN PROGRAMS LIKE OUR AFFECT PROGRAM AND EVERY WOMAN COUNTS. A FEW OTHER THINGS JUST NOTE REGARDS TO CRITICAL CHANGES- WE DID- INCREASE THE- RATES FOR LONG TERM CARE AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BY ADDITIONAL FUNDS- TO PAY FOR P. P. ADDITIONAL STAFFING ETCETERA REALLY CRITICAL DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE HAVE THE PENDING- STATE PLAN REQUEST WITH CMS TO INCREASE- OXYGEN 2100% OF MEDICARE GIVEN THIS CURRENT- SHORTAGES IN IN ISSUES GOING ON AROUND THE STATE THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT MOVE. A WE DID THE SAME WITH COVER NINETEEN TESTING ENSURING THAT COULD NINETEEN TESTING WAS PAID AT A 100% OF MEDICARE PERSONS ARE TYPICAL 80% OF MEDICARE. WE ALSO QUICKLY I WORKED WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS- TO IMPLEMENT INTEROPERATES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. TO ALLOW- A STEADY FLOW OF CASH TO THE COUNTIES DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WITH THE RECONCILIATION. AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WE DIDN'T MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR ALLOWABLE- COUNTY ADMIN COSTS DURING THIS TIME AS WELL. WE DID- PUT NOTICE OUT TO ALL PROVIDERS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IF THEY HAD HARDSHIPS HOW THEY COULD WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON OVER PAYMENT SCHEDULES- AND WE ALSO. IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITIES ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE WITH SAM'S- AND ENERGY YOU WHY PROGRAM. A FEW OTHER KIND OF PIECES JUST TO NOTE- WE IMPLEMENTED CAL HOPE- WHICH IS A CRISIS COUNSELING PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FEMA- THAT ALLOWS FOR TWENTY SEVEN ACCESS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ACCESS TO COUNSELING SERVICES- WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH CMS ON OUR VACCINE REQUESTED HOW WE WILL PAY FOR- VACCINES. IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM MIMI HERE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE REQUESTED TO COVER ALL MEDICARE POPULATIONS INCLUDING THE UNINSURED AND THE RESTRICTED SCOPE INDIVIDUALS YOU'RE HOPING CMS WILL COME BACK WITH AN APPROVAL ON THAT. WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON THE TESTING IN SCHOOLS PORTION OF THAT IF IMPACTS MEDI CAL CHILDREN- AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM ON FLEXIBILITIES IN CRISIS STABILIZATION FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AT THIS TIME- I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE. THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL AND INTEND TO EXTEND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCYTHROUGH THE END. OF THIS YEAR I WHICH ALIGNS WITH OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND THAT THEY DO PLAN ON GIVIG STATES A SIXTY DAY NOTICE PRIOR TO THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TO ALLOW FOR PLANNING. COMMUNICATION WITH PROVIDERS MANAGED CARE PLANS BENEFICIARIES- WHICH WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY AT DH CS BUILDING OUR COMPREHENSIVE UNWINDING PLANNED FOR WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND- POWERFUL ROLE THAT INFORMATION OUT. TO OUR PROVIDERS PLANS BENEFICIARIES BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO PUT IN PLACE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS CONTINUING. AND WEBER AND- SO I WILL THERE AND SEE IF THERE. REGARDING HOW DO YOU CS HAS RESPONDED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I THINK I THINK I JUST BURST LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT. THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR WORK A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. AND NOBODY PLANNED ON A PANDEMIC BUT THEN HERE CAME IN SO I JUST I HAVE A QUICK REACTION TIME I THINK TO THE BIGGEST POPULATION. IN THE NATION TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. AS QUICKLY AS WE DID SO THANK YOU FOR OUR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK. A DIFFERENT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT- PRESENTATION AND- SO- IMPRISONED THE IN THE BUDGET THE F. MAP ENHANCEMENTS- BASICALLY IS LINED UP WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CORRECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE IT THIS ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT BE EXTENDED UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT IT CURRENTLY ALIGNS WITH WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROPOSED FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OKAY AND THEN I SOON MASTERS DIVERGENCE HE ADDS THAT THE ENHANCE F. NAPOL. MOLD THEN REVERT BACK TO OUR CLUB USUAL F. MAP AND THAT ALL RIGHT AND THEN DO AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED- AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PREDICT WHAT CMS IS GOING TO DO- BUT- APPRECIATE THE- THE- PENDING APPROVAL EMAIL THE SPOTS THAT YOU PUT IN FRONT- DID YOU. DO YOU WANT BE ABLE TO. GIVE US A WHEN YOU THINK OF. WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR EXAMPLE THE VACCINATION COVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT OF TESTING IN SCHOOLS IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S FAR ALONG THE PROCESS SIR- I AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA HOLD YOU TO EXPLAIN NOTE CMS ASIAN NOT YOURS BUT- WHAT WHAT'S YOUR HOPE FOR TIMELINE FOR. IF FOR HOPEFULLY- DECISION OR APPROVAL OR- FOR OUR LACK OF APPROVAL FOR THE SAID REQUEST. SO WE HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVELY WORKING WITH CMS REGARDING BOTH VACCINES AND TESTING IN SCHOOLS. OF ALL BREAK THEM- SEPARATELY SO FOR THE VACCINE COVERAGE- BUT WE- WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL APPROVE THAT CARVE OUT VACCINES FROM MANAGED CARE TO P. FOR SERVICE WE PROPOSE THAT. I'VE GIVEN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REIMBURSING THE ADMIN PORTION OF THE VACCINE- WE HAD NOT BUILT INTO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN RATES AND SO FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE WE ALSO WANTED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE- ACCESS REGARDLESS OF WHO IS PROVIDING THE VACCINE AND SO. AS LONG AS THEY WERE IN ROLLED MEDIC CAL PROVIDER- IT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BILL FEE FOR SERVICE AND SO WE FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE CMS WILL IMPROVE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN DOING SOME BACK AND FORTH WITH CMS IN REGARDS TO- WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD ALLOW US TO COVER THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE UNINSURED- AND THE RESTRICTED SCOPE AND WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT- WITH THEM HOWEVER THEY HAVE. THEY DO HAVE SOME OPTIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT ON THAT FRONT OUTSIDE AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT- WITH CMS TO DRAW DOWN THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS. ON THE TESTING IN SCHOOLS- WE TALKED TO CMS VERY REGULARLY. HER GUIDING THIS I THINK. THIS WEEKEND LAST WEEK WE HAD- COME. AND EMAILS- I THINK WE ARE GETTING CLOSE- IN REGARDS TO THIS ONE I THINK THAT THEY ARE- WANTING TO VERY MUCH PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA REGARDING THIS APPROACH- IN SO WE ARE WHO. WE ARE CONTINUE TO WORK AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO- HAVE EIGHT RESULT OR APPROVAL OR INFORMATION FROM CMS- IN THE COMING WEEKS- IF NOT NEXT WEEK HOPEFULLY. REGARDING THAT OUTCOME. OKAY NO APPRECIATE THAT ALSO FEATURED ON THE VACCINE COVERAGE WE'RE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR VACCINE MINISTRATION I KNOWTHAN THE MEDICAID SIDE HIS PEDIATRICIAN TAKES CARE OF MEDICAL PATIENTS. SOMETIMES THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR A DEMONSTRATION STILL BELOW COSTS SO THAT'S AND SOMETIMES A CHALLENGE FOR SOME. PROVIDERS ACTUALLY DELIVER VACCINES SO- WILL BE SURE THAT THE DAY EXPENSES ARE COVERED- OF- I THINK BOTH BECAUSE WILL DIVE INTO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS MORE AND MORE DETAILED SUBSEQUENT. ISSUES SO THANK YOU. BOTH OF ALL UP QUESTION TO THAT JUST ON ON THE OF. VACCINES IN AND- IN SCHOOL. HAVE YOU HAVE YOU IS THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS YOU'VE HEARD FROM YOUR PROVIDERS IS IT THE LACK OF STAFF FOR THE LACK OF TESTING IN ORDER OR THE LACK OF STAFF I'M SORRY FOR THE LACK OF VACCINATIONS IN ORDER TO FULLY DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINATIONS- TO THE CONSTITUENCIES. I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHERS IN REGARDS TO- THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION- AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR EXAMPLE- AS INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING VACCINATED WE ARE WORKING ON DATA FEEDS IMMEDIATELY BACK TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANSSO THAT THEY CAN BE PARTNERS IN IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO- HAVE NOT HAD. A VACCINE- YET AND TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT ONCE IT IS IN THE PHASE IN WHICH THAT PERSON WOULD BE- AVAILABLE. I THINK THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF GREAT BUT- YOU KNOW- MOVEMENT TO RECENTLY IN REGARDS TO HAVING MORE ACCESS TO VACCINE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF PLANS THAT ARE STILL ROLLING OUT IN REGARDS TO IT. I THINK YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY HAS TO DO PROBABLY WITH THE- THE NUMBER OF VACCINES COMING TO THIS TO THE STATE. OF AND SO I THINK GETTING THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE VACCINES IN. A WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH KEY PARTNERS LIKE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE- HUGE PLAYERS IN THE MEDICAID SPACE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE DOING. WHAT THEY CAN IN THEIR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS YOU NOT ONLY GET THE VACCINE OUT TO MEDICAID INDIVIDUALS BUT FOCUSING ON IT FROM AN EQUITY LENS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE INVESTING THEMSELVES N COMMUNITIES WHERE. THERE MAY NOT BE AS MUCH ACCESS AND SO I THINK THERE WILL CONTINUE TO OUR PARTNER WITH OUR- R. T. PROVIDERS ON THE ON THE GROUND OF DOING THIS VACCINE WORK TO HOPEFULLY GET- IS MANY. MEDICAID INDIVIDUALS- WITH THE VACCINE AS SOON AS WE CAN WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADD TO CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WITHIN THE PHASING IN. THE TEARS THAT ARE ANNOUNCED BY PUBLIC HEALTH. I AND I WOULD AND I WOULD JUST I GUESS JUST JUST TO SAY I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES AROUND OF ANXIETY FOR PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS IS THAT THE NEW THIRD PARTY. ADMINISTRATOR COMING INTO MAKING SURE THE NETWORKS THAT WE PROTECT THAT THAT EVERY MUNICIPALITY HAS. STOOD UP OVER THIS LAST YEAR IS STILL GOING TO BE UTILIZED AND ALL THOSE CONTACTS ARE GOING TO BE JUST. JUST FOR NOT CAN YOU TELL ME HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE FURTHER ALONG WITH US IN GETTING THIS APPROVAL FROM CMS- IN REGARDS TO BACK SCENES OR TESTING. OR AS I KNOW- I DO NOT KNOW WHERE OTHER STATES ARE IN REGARDS TO THEIR VACCINE APPROACH I KNOW THAT- WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH A NUMBER OF STATES IN REGARDS TO IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY RECEIVED AN APPROVAL- I WOULD I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK AND CHECK WITH MY OTHER. MEDICAID DIRECTORS- IN ON TESTING IN SCHOOLS I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST WITH THE PROPOSAL TO CMS I'M IN THE NATURE OF WHICH WE ARE REQUESTING. ED GENERAL INDUSTRY YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. FOR GOOD THANK YOU MANAGER DEPARTMENT FINANCE. MISTER JESSE RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF CRINOID APARTMENT FINANCES NOTHING HAD THANK YOU OKAY FILIAL. YEAH HI BEN JOHNSON FROM THE LA A ONE SORT OF BE THE CONTEXT WANTED TO ADD IS THAT FEDERAL LEGISLATION SORT OF ESTABLISHED THE YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO COVER AT A 100% FEDERAL FUNDS THAT TESTING COST FOR- FOR KOBE. THE STATE ELECTED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT AS WELL WITHIN THIS INSURANCE POPULATION AT A AND IT'S CURRENTLY REFLECTED AS A SORT OF A- ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT MAY EXIST FOR THE STATE IS EVEN IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ELECTS NOT TO SORT OF. FIND THEIR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION COSTS FOR THIS POPULATION. TO USE STATE FUNDS TO DO SO. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THEN NUMBER THREE THAT MEDICAL LOCAL ASSISTANT ESTIMATE. GREAT ALL THAT SO WITHIN THE MEDICAL LOCAL SYSTEMS ESTIMATE FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE ESTIMATE PROJECT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL- FUND SPENDING IN META CAL I'M TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IN GENERAL FUND- THIS DOES REPRESENT A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION TOTAL FUND INCREASE 42% INCREASE OF FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMPARED TO THE BUDGET ACT- HOWEVER GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS DOWN BY ONE POINT TWO BILLION COMPARED TO THE BUDGET ACT. SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF THIS CHANGE- IS ESTIMATED SPENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE INCLUDES A LOWER PROJECTION OF CASELOAD INCREASE OF AN INCREASE PROJECTION OF FOR THE AMOUNT OF INCREASED F. MAP AS WE WERE MENTIONING EARLIER- REDUCED ESTIMATES OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE STATE ONLY CLAIMING THAT WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON AS WELL AS A MANAGED CARE EXTENDED FILE CORRECTION ON THAT RESULT IN A ONE TIME COST OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF THE ESTIMATE PROJECTS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION IN TOTAL FUNDS SPENT FOR MEDIC CAL OF WHICH TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION WOULD COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND THIS REFLECTS A THREE POINT 7% INCREASE OF TOTAL SPENDING- AND A TWENTY SIX POINT FOUR INCREASE AND GENERAL FUND SPENDING ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS FOR THESE CHANGES INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN COSTS RELATED TO THE CUP IN NINETEEN CASELOAD- BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL. CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IT ALSO ASSUMES AN INCREASED F. MAP AND THAT WOULD BE ENDING AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED FOR THAT ARE TWENTY ONE TIME PERIOD WHICH RESULTS.

AS WELL AS FUNDS A VARIETY OF OTHER PROPOSALS INCLUDING REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING AS WELL AS OTHER- ITEMS WITHIN ON THE BUDGET INCLUDING THINGS LIKE CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING- SO I WILL STOP THERE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE WASHINGTON. THANK YOU ACTUALLY BOB. WE JUST HAVE A NICE ASK KELLY- TO COMMENT ON IT AND I DON'T QUESTION REGARDING THE CASE LIST I LIKE TO HEAR FROM LA WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE. FIRST HELLO AT HI. GOOD MORNING THIS IS- NETWORKS THE CALL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FIRST OFF JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT. WE'VE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE OVERALL MEDICAL BUDGET IS THAT THEY'LL GO ON OUR WEBSITE. A KEY FOCUS OF THE IN HOUSE THIS IS ON IS ON CASELOAD WE HAVE WE HAVE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVER- CASELOAD GROWTH WHICH IS. IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ACCOUNTS FOR A- VERY SIGNIFICANT HE'S OF THE- YEAR OVER YEAR FUNDING INCREASE MMHM I THINK YOU TAKE AWAY OF OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT CASELOAD GROWTH WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS- AND WE'RE EXPECTING AS A RESULT. ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS LAST IN CASE OF RELATED COSTS OVER BOTH MEDIA PER YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR. HAVING SAID THAT WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW. VK SO% PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY EVEN. MORE MORE SUBTLY AND NOT AT THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE UNPRECEDENTED. A PANDEMIC. AND SO WE FEEL WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO WE UNTIL MAY WHEN WE HAVE- DATA ON- CASES INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC TO WORK OFF OF- BUT JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER. SOME OF THE SOURCES OF OUR OUR DIFFERENCES- SO IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORIC GROWTH OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT'S FAR FROM. MARCH TWENTY TWENTY UP UNTIL DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS THAT WHEN THE MOST RECENT- DATA ON KESSLER WAS AVAILABLE- WHEN WE WERE CONDUCTING OUR ANALYSIS- OVER OVER THAT. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY MEDICAL CASE OF GROWTH WAS A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND NEW ENROLLEES- I NOW ORDER TO REACH THE AT NUMBER IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING. THAT WOULD NEED TO INCREASE IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY NEARLY 50% FROM FROM LESS THAN A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND NEW ENROLLEES- MONTHS YOU. NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- ENROLLEES PER MONTH. NOW THAT THAT IS WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY BUT WE THINK IT REPRESENTS A- WORST CASE SCENARIO RATHER THAN WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE THE- THE LIKELY SCENARIO. THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT. WE THINK THAT OF THE NEW ENROLLEES SET THAT WILL BE ADDED OVER THE COURSE OF A CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE EXPECT A RELATIVELY FEW WORST IN YEARS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT POPULATION AND ILLUSTRATION IS PREDICTING AND- MORE FAMILIES AND CHILDLESS ADULTS WHO ARE RELATIVELY SPEAKING TEND TO BE. LESS COSTLY TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO- SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE- PROJECTED A ONE BILLION DOLLARS LOWER THAN THE- ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING. BUT BUT AGAIN I JUST- JUST TO REITERATE- THIS IS ALL SUBJECT TO- SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AND SO AS A RESULT WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET BEFORE NAY- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ARE YOU- ARE YOU IN ARE YOU PROJECTING. FEWER SENIORS JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY'RE ALREADY ALL IN THE POOL. ALL RIGHT YEAH WELL BEYOND A LOT OF THE- WHAT'S DRIVING CASELOAD IS- GOING TO BE- EMPLOYMENT LOSSES. AND SO WE THINK THAT AS A RESULT. IN MANY OF THE GAMES ARE GOING TO BE FROM THE WORKING AGE POPULATION. THANK YOU .COM YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- VITIATE COMING FROM BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND A LOW- ON THIS SO IN THIS PROJECTION- WE'RE ASSUMING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL GO UNTIL. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE I UNDERSTAND THAT- AS PART OF THE- THAT WE BOTH GET INCREASE F. MAP BUT ALSO WE'RE WE- ALSO HAVE TO COMMIT TO PROVIDING. CONTINUED COVERAGE AND THAT SEEMS AT LEAST FROM THE EXPLANATION IS PART OF ONE OF THE STRONGEST WRITING SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S INCREASED CASELOAD- WAS THERE ALSO IN YOUR PROJECTION WHAT WHAT WAS YOUR PROJECTION WHAT HAPPENED THE CASELOAD AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHEN AND IF. TO ME THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OVER AND WE. LOSE THE F. MAP BUT WE ALSO THEN WOULD. THEN ALSO ALAMEDA REQUIRED TO RETAIN PEOPLE MEDIC. AND ESSENTIALLY GO BACK TO OUR USUAL MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY NOW I'M SOMEONE WHO USUALLY LIKE TO GET MORE PEOPLE ENROLLED NOT LESS PEOPLE SO I'M NOT LOOKING FOR HER. YOU KNOW HAVING A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE FALL OFF BUT- I DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AFTER TO. PUT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES OVERLY SPACE AND THAT REQUIREMENT NO LONGER APPLIES AS WELL AS THE YOU KNOW LOSS OF THESE ENHANCE F. MAP SO IN TERMS OF CASELOAD WHAT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE WAS ADMINISTRATION PROJECTING FOR THIS BUDGET. OR SO- WE DO- WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE GUIDANCE THAT CMS'S PROVIDED IN REGARDS TO THE STEPS THAT STATES WILL HAVE TO TAKE TO. LOOK AT REDETERMINATION AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- YOUR MASTER'S CURRENT RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THAT TAKE PLACE WITHIN SIX MONTHS HOWEVER. GIVEN THE LARGE- SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE MEDIC HOW- PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA- WE ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED IN THE BUDGET THAT IT WOULD TAKE A FULL TWELVE MONTHS TO. EVALUATE I'M INTO THE RE DETERMINATIONS FOR THAT TIME PERIOD- IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE- THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD STAY ON. A MEDIC CAL BASED ON THAT REDETERMINATION OF AND OPPOSE- THAT WOULD AND- NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE OF SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM OR COULD HAVE A CHANGE ENSURE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE ALL OF THOSE SCENARIOS ARE. ARE POSSIBLE- AFTER THAT TIME PERIOD AND SO THAT IS WHAT THE BUDGET IS CURRENTLY ASSUMING OKAY SO THEREFORE YOU WOULD EXPECT- THAT NOBODY WOULD BE THIS DROPPED WHAT HAPPENED OVER A PERIOD OF A YEAR IN TERMS OF RETURNING ELIGIBILITY. AND AND IF THE CMS GUIDANCE IS SIX MONTHS IS THAT. DOES THAT PUT THE STATE AT RISK. FOR BASICALLY COURSE THE FEDERAL BATCHES THEY THEY MAY COME BACK AND SAY WELL GEE WHAT YOU KNOW WE WANT YOU TO DO THIS IN SIX MONTHS AND- WHY SHOULD WE BE PAYING A MATCH FOR SOMETHING OVER YEARS AND ISSUES THAT. YOU'D EXPECT MIGHT COME UP- IN TERMS OF. AGAIN I'M SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DOESN'T WANT TO TRY TO TELL PEOPLE OFF THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS BEING A FEDERAL STATE PROGRAM. AND CMS GIVES GUIDELINES- IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THEIR GUIDELINES STATE SOMETIMES SAY OKAY WE WANT TO CLAW BACK OUR SHARE THE MONEY AND YOU CAN PAY FOR IT. SO DO WE- CAN DO WHAT CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY THAT'S AN ISSUE. SO ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY ADVOCATING WITH CMS. TO ALLOW FOR THE TWELVE MONTH TIME PERIOD- AND ARTICULATING TO THEM WHY THAT'S GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT I THINK- WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY. ISSUED THAT GUIDANCE I DON'T THINK MANY ANTICIPATED THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WOULD BE. I'M STILL IN PLACE ALL THE WAY THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT GUIDANCE WAS RELEASED. I'M QUITE SOME TIME AGO I DURING. THAT TWENTY TWENTY AND SO- WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION COMING IN- WE HAVE FULL INTENTIONS OF. I'M CONTINUING TO EDUCATE OUR CMS COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THE HEAVY LIFT THAT THIS WILL TAKE ESPECIALLY IN STATES AS LARGE AS CALIFORNIA. WITH THE NUMBER OF LIVES THAT WE WILL HAVE TO RE DETERMINE- IN OF COURSE THE CMS STILL OPINES WE DO HAVE ESTIMATES ARE THAT ALLOW FOR US TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW- AND WE WOULD. BE LOOKING TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS ON WHAT THAT WOULD TAKE THEM. IN ORDER TO MEET WITHIN SIX MONTHS VERSUS TWELVE MONTHS SO WE DO HAVE- ANALYTICS ON BOTH SIDES BUT ARE CURRENTLY STILL I'M ADVOCATING TO CMS THAT. WE NEED TO BE REASONABLE- WITHIN THIS- EXTENSION ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AT THIS POINT HAS GONE AS LONG AS IT HAS. OKAY THANK YOU AN ALLEY- ARE USING THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS AND YOUR DETERMINATION IF- CASELOAD FOR. NEXT YEAR RECOGNIZING THAT AFTER DECEMBER. AND USING THE SAME ASSUMPTION THAT AFTER DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AT LEAST- THAT- COMMITTEE SOME CHANGES BECAUSE AT THE END. WELL THE END OF THE PROJECTED AND OF THE PUBLIC EMERGENCY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT REALLY. BUT BECAUSE- SINCE WE'RE GUESSING INTO THE FUTURE. YES SENATOR- WE- WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS LIKELY TO AND- IS REASONABLE- WE HAVE THE RE DETERMINATIONS. AT THE- BEGINNING OF THE- RESUMPTION OF REDETERMINATION IS STARTING OUT A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION JUST BECAUSE WE- WE THINK IT WILL. TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME FOR US TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THAT. IN THE CASE OF NUMBERS. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A SMALL DIFFERENCE ALSO IN THE RATE AT WHICH WE THINK THE REDETERMINATION WILL AFFECT CASELOAD OVER THE- COMING YEAR BUT- OVERALL EIGHT EIGHT. IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION AND L. A. O. R. R. FAIRLY ALIGNMENT ON ON THE A. SIX OPTIONS OKAY SO SOUNDS LIKE THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR- YOUR ASSUMPTIONS AND- AND MINISTRATION HAS TO DO MORE WITH THE ENROLLMENT RATE TODAY AND THE PEOPLE BEING DISTANT ROLL LATER. SO OKAY. I THANK YOU I THINK THIS GROUP DEPARTMENT FINANCING THEN THAT CENTER MELINDA'S. MORNING AND NIGHT BECAUSE THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- JUST WANT TO CIRCLE BACK ON A FEW ISSUES THAT. LA- REYES IN REGARDS TO CASE LOAD SO- ONE IN TERMS OF THE ENROLLMENT RATE- OUR ESTIMATE DOES PROJECT THAT THE ENROLLMENT RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WILL BE HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL THAT WE'VE SEEN IN TWENTY TWENTY AND WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE RECENT ONE THAT'S- PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT- ACTUALS IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU DON'T REALLY REVEAL ANY ON LABOR MARKET UPTAKE AS WE HAD EXPECTED AT THE BUDGET ACT. BUT IN CONSULTING RESEARCHERS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE LABOR MARKET IMPACTS AND ECONOMIC I'LL FOLLOW OF THE RECESSION WILL RESULT IN SOME OF THAT TAKE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND SO AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE KIND OF. A HIGHER RATE OF ENROLLMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE SECOND ISSUE THE CASELOAD MIX OR THE DISTRIBUTION- THE PERCENT OF SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR FISCAL IS REALLY BEING DRIVEN BY THE AXLES THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE. POPULATION TO DATE SO WILL BE CIRCLING BACK WITH- BELIAU AFTER THIS TO SEE WHAT MIGHT BE THE DISCREPANCY IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL AS WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE OUR CASELOAD MIX. IS REASONABLE GIVEN THE ACTUAL. CELL WE'RE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU. WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE STAYING ON BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE DISCHARGE IN THE NEXT YEAR. EXACTLY THANK U. S. CENTER MELENDEZ. I THINK CHAIR- SO BE THE DOWNTURN IN THE LABOR MARKET IN CALIFORNIA HAS CERTAINLY INCREASED IN SEVERITY. DUE TO THE LOCKDOWN DECISIONS BY THE GOVERNOR I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY WITH THE INCREASES OF PEOPLE ON MEDICARE DUE TO JOB LOSS. SURE SO I THINK- YOU KNOW IT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING FOR US TO EVALUATE THE MEDIC CAL ENROLLMENT AND THE CURRENT ECONOMY I THINK HISTORICAL- TRENDS ARE NOT THE SAME THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CLEARLY. ONE THING I WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW MEDI CAL HAD BEEN SEEN INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT UP UNTIL ABOUT EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN- AND THEN AS THE ECONOMY GOT BETTER- WE HAVE SEEN A STEADY DECREASE IN MEDIC HOW BETWEEN AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RIGHT UP UNTIL THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HAD STEADILY. BEEN DECLINING FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS OUR CURRENT NUMBER SHOWS BACK UP AT THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN PEAK IN REGARDS TO WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS AT ITS WORST RIGHT SO IT DOES SHOW THAT- THAT THAT FACTOR HAS DEFINITELY INCREASED AND SHOWN A MATIC CAL ENROLLMENT- THE TWO BIGGEST FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE ALSO IS WITH THE CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT WE SEE PEOPLE WHO. WILL FOLLOW UP OUR PROGRAM BUT THEN MAYBE COME BACK ON A YEAR OR TWO LATER AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT TURN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STAYING ON THE PROGRAM- AND SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN AS MUCH IMPACT FROM THE- THE ECONOMY HIT SB ASSUMES WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIGHER WHICH IS WHY YOU SAW THE ADJUSTMENT BETWEEN BUDGET ACTED IN NOW- WE'RE TRYING TO TRUE THOSE THINGS UP- BUT WE DO STILL THINK THERE WILL BE CONTINUED GROWTH- WE'VE SEEN THE LARGEST GROWTH WITHIN THE ACA OPTIONAL- ELIGIBILITY GROUP- AND WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE FAMILY AND CHILD CATEGORY INCREASE IT HASN'T REACHED QUITE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LEVELS- THAT WE HAD SEEN. WHERE THE ECONOMY WAS PREVIOUSLY BAD- OR NOT AT THAT THE PEAK OF MEDICARE ENROLLMENT BUT IT IS IT IS GETTING CLOSE WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR VERY CLOSELY WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ADVOCATES VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DID ASSUME IT WOULD WOULD BE HIGHER I'M UP THERE ARE STILL MANY COMPLICATING FACTORS ESTIMATE MAYBE WHY IT ISN'T BUT. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE CLOSELY. ISN'T THAT- YOU'RE NOT. SEEING THE- BEING TRICKY TO JOHNMYERS FOR IS THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT ABLE TO ADEQUATELY TRACK. ARE WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE I CAN'T ASSUME ALL OF ITS BASED ON JOB LOSS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT SINCE WE'VE SEEN PRIOR TO YOU- THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE ACA OPTIONS MEASURE ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY STEADY IF YOU LOOK AT OUR A CODE- CHART IT SHOWS AN INCREASE THAT GROUP WHICH WOULD. YOU WOULD ASSUME THAT IS BASED ON JOB LOSS BUT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MEDIC CAL I'M COMING INTO A MEDICAL THAT'S SOMEWHAT OF THE CHILDLESS ADULTS THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE L. A. L. AND SO THAT WAS IN ITS SOON TO INCREASE THAT WE EXPECTED TO SEE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I JUST NOT AT THE LEVELS AND NUMBERS AND WHICH WE ASSUME GIVEN THE- UNEMPLOYMENT RATES CURRENTLY AND IN CALIFORNIA- HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD BETTER TIES TO MEDIC CAL IN ROME AND UNEMPLOYMENT BUT- IT HAS. IT'S BEEN HARDER TO TRACK DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FIFTEEN THANK YOU. OKAY THING ELSE RIGHT THEN I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CALLING. HELLO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THREE FOUR. OKAY I'M SORRY WHICH- OKAY IS A SMALL ONE YES IT WILL BE SHORT- SO FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FAMILY HEALTH SPENDING IS ESTIMATED TO BE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THIS IS A SIXTY FOUR MILLION INCREASE IN TOTAL SPENDING AND A FORTY FIVE MILLION A DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING- COMPARED TO THE MAY TWENTY TWENTY ESTIMATES- CHANGES IN THE TIMING AROUND DRUG REBATES AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. ON IS THE LARGEST FACTOR DRIVING THE CHANGE OF THE ESTIMATE AND SPENDING IN THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE OF FAMILY HEALTH LOCAL ASSISTANCE ESTIMATES IF IT'S CLEAR TWENTY- ONE TWENTY TWO THE FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATES ARE PROJECTS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE MILLION- GENERAL FUND- AND THIS CHANGE ESSENTIALLY REFLECTS THE END OF THE ONE TIME DRUG REBATE CHANGES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET AND TWENTY ARE TWENTY ONE. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANYTHING FROM THE FINANCE. LMAO. OKAY OKAY. SO JUST TO CLARIFY YOU MENTIONED THAT- BECAUSE WHAT I SEE HERE IS FOR C. C. S. WE SEE ESSENTIALLY 44% REDUCTION- EVEN THOUGH THE CASELOADS REPORTED TO ACTUALLY GO UP SLIGHTLY. SO SO YOUNG GENERAL FUND RESERVE VICE NINETY SIX- MILLION DOWN TO SEVENTY EIGHT FEDERAL FUNDS GO DOWN TO ZERO SO THAT ALL DRUG EXPENSES ARE HE EXPLAINED WHY THE 44% DECREASE IN CCS EXPENDITURE. IT REALLY IS. MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO- THE REBATES WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF. CHILDREN WHO WERE ON CCS STATE ONLY- WHICH IS WHAT WE SUPPORT IN THE FAMILY HAS TO GO TO THE CCS MEDICAL BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN INCOME. FAMILIES HAVE TRANSITIONED OVER TO MEDIC CAL AND OUT OF THE C. C. ESTATE ONLY SO IT'S GONNA BE A COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS OKAY SO. ALL RIGHT YES EXEMPTION MEASURE IN THE FORTIES AS CONDITIONS WE DON'T HAVE CURES FOR SO I WOULD EXPECT THE NUMBERS OF. KIDS WHO NEED TO PROGRAM WHEN A CHANGE THAT DRAMATICALLY SO BASICALLY TO SHIFTING TO FROM STATE ONLY TO MEDIC HEALTH FORTY FIVE BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING ECONOMIC. DISTRESS AS WELL AS THE BUDGET OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. EXPLANATION COURSE. OKAY NOW I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO- THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR KELLY. ALL RIGHT- SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU SEE IT STARTED THE CALLIN JOURNEY- BACK IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE MYSELF TO- GO ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PROVIDERS I COUNTIES MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORKING AND MEDICARE OUT AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND MEDICARE- AND THE DEPARTMENT ROLL THAT OUT. AND IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND IT WAS- CALLED YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDICARE- AND IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE. A STRATEGY- THAT THEN IN IN QUICKLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY HIDDEN AND WE PUT IT ON A DELAYED AND THEN PUT IT BACK INTO THE IN THE BUDGET THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY FOR CONSIDERATION- SO YOU KNOW. WHAT REALLY IS KELLY AND I THINK YOU KNOW FOR US- WE REALLY SEE IT AS- USING A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDATION- GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS- THROUGH IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION. OF PATIENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT I'M IN THE CORPORATE FINANCING AND CARE MODELS- YOU KNOW HEALTHCARE HAS THREE MAIN LEVERS BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY AND FINANCING AND TELLING REALLY INFLUENCES. ALL THREE OF THOSE TO CHANGE MEDICARE OUT IN A WAY THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO. HELP PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY OUTCOMES FOR BENEFICIARIES AS WELL AS THE BENCHLEY BAND BACK COST CURVE- WE- WE THINK THAT KALYAN HELPS INFLUENCE- ON A BILL TO CONTINUE ON FROM. BIRTH ALL THE WAY TO END OF LIFE- BASED ON THE COMPONENTS IN THERE AND I WILL G THROUGH SOME OF THOSE- TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. ON HOW THAT THAT REALLY HELPS STANDARDIZE THAT. WE ALSO SEE YOU'LL SEE AND CAL LAME THAT WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ON STANDARDIZING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF BEHIND WHAT WE'RE WE'RE DOING IN THERE- BECAUSE WE REALLY DO THINK THAT- WHERE YOU LIVE SHOULD NOT DICTATE THE CARE THAT YOU GET AND SO. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PIECES IS STANDARDIZING MANAGED CARE ENROLLMENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS BUT BENEFITS ARE CARVED INTO MANAGED CARE VERSUS OUT- AS WELL AS JUST HAVING A CONSISTENT SYSTEM- YOU ALSO SEE A FOCUS ON. INTEGRATING ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND ELEVATING SYSTEMS LIKE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE A CENTURY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE ARE- EXPECTING FROM A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WERE% AND- PROPOSING THINGS LIKE PAYMENT REFORM I CHANGES TO ACCESS WITH MEDICAL NECESSITY UP CLEAR FOR CATIONS. INTEGRATION AND REALLY EXPANDING ACCESS SO WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THE PROPOSALS- ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ELEVATING ON BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE IN CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT- WE HAVEN'T HISTORICALLY. DONE IN MOVING FORWARD- YOU ALSO SEE. IN CAL AIM OF PUSHING OVER IDEA VALUE BASED PAY AN ISSUE DID. A IT FOCUSES ON HEALTHCARE AFFORDED. AS WELL AS MAKING THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS TO BEND THAT COST CURVE SO YOU'LL SEE THINGS IN CALENDAR INCLUDE THE BEHAVIOR ALL PAYMENT REFORM I MENTIONED BEFORE. I WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY PAYING OUR COUNTIES ON A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT MOVING THEM TO A- A FEE SCHEDULE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP FUNDS- IN ADDITION TO OVER ACROSS THAT THEY CAN REINVEST INTO THE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS REALLY IMPORTANT- WE TALK ABOUT SHARED SAVINGS WHETHER MANAGED CARE PLANS INCENTIVES IN REGIONAL RATES. REALLY DRIVING ADDS ACCOUNTABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS WITH IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM IS REALLY. IMPORTANT HOWEVER I THINK THE PROBABLY THE LARGEST THING THAT YOU SEE OUT WITH IN. THE CALLIN PROPOSAL FOR THE- AT LEAST FOR THE UPCOMING FUTURE IS REALLY LEARNING AND LESSONS FROM OUR HELP HOMES INITIATIVE ON A PILOT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND VARIOUS COUNTIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A WHOLE PERSON CARE I'M ONE OF THE BACKBONES OF TELLING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING A WHOLE PERSON CARE APPROACHES ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND REDUCING HEALTH- DISPARITIES THAT WE CLEARLY SEE ACROSS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I THINK THOUGH WE HAVE HAD PILOTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE SOME TIME WE WANT TO TAKE THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE PILOTS. AND MOVE THEM TO A STATE WIDE PROGRAM- WE THINK THAT IT IS. REALLY IMPORTANT THOSE THOSE PILOTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED HEALTH HOMES FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH FOUNDATION FUNDING ON HISTORICALLY- AND IN IN THE BUDGET HAD TO MOVE TO USE- SOME. PROPOSED A GENERAL FUND THERE AND THAT WHOLE PERSON CARE OF FUNDED BY LOCAL COUNTIES IN PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS- IN SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE MOVING FORWARD. THE BUDGET DOES PROPOSE TO TAKE- THE LESSONS OF THOSE IN WHAT WE CALL AN HEY CARE MANAGE. AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES. YOU TAKE THAT STATE WIDE- WE WOULD SAY THAT- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TRANSITION THESE THINGS WE'VE HAD GREAT LESSONS LEARNED FROM HELP HUNDRED WHOLE PERSON CARE. BUT THEY'RE CURRENTLY FUNDED IN OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER OF WHICH THE STATE WILL BE TRANSITIONING OUT OF- AND THERE IS A JEOPARDY IF THAT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE TO END AND WE DIDN'T TRANSITION TO ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT AND- FOR EXAMPLE- THAT THERE WOULD BE A FUNDING CLIFF. FOR ARCHIE COUNTY AND PUBLIC HOSPITAL PARTNERS- WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR US TO SUSTAIN YEAH AND WE REALLY HAVE SEEN THE VALUE OF WHAT THOSE BRING A MAKING SURE WE'RE PROVIDING ROBUST CARE COORDINATION FOR SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE BENEFICIARIES- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO BY LEVERAGING IT THROUGH CATALANES WE REALLY THINK THAT WE CAN DO THAT SO NOW I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AROUND ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES. TO PROVIDE CONTEXT I'LL GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW CALAMP WILL HELP CERTAIN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SO I ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE LEARNED IN IN SOMETHING I- YOU KNOW PRIOR TO COMING TO THE STATE WORKING ON IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND RUNNING. CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THEY'RE SO CRITICAL TO BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH VERY COMPLEX- INDIVIDUALS- WHO ARE OFTEN TIMES FACING MULTIPLE A CHRONIC DISEASES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- CONCERNS AS WELL AS MANY SOCIAL DRIVERS IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY TO. ENGAGE IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM- SO WE ARE PROPOSING- ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT WHICH WOULD BE A COMMUNITY BASED INTENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM- THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD CONTRACT WITH. A PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE- IT WOULD INCLUDE A SERVICES FOR- VARIOUS TARGET POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX MEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS S. R. AT RISK OF BEING. HOME HI. THERE'S A MERGING. ZERO- HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES JUST HIGH UTILIZES WITH THAT OUR SYSTEM. OF THOSE AT RISK OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION- AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT FROM INCARCERATION AND THE IDEA IS TO WRAP IN INTENSIVE SERVICE AROUND THEM THAT IS ON THE GROUND GO TO WEAR THAT INDIVIDUAL IS- AND PROVIDE THOSE INTENSIVE SERVICES. WERE ALSO PROPOSING- A LIST OF FOURTEEN WHAT WE CALL IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT A GOOD NAME- BUT ESSENTIALLYIT'S SUPPLEMENTAL WRAP SERVICES THAT- ALLOW US YOU TAKE SOME OF THOSE SOCIAL DRIVERS- IMPEDING SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO- AS- YOU KNOW HAVE A HEALTHY A LIFE. OR IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH- AND IMPORTANTLY REDUCE THE COST OF CARE- IN WHAT WE PROVIDE AND THERE'S A LONG LIST THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE HOUSING NAVIGATION DEPOSITS INTENDANCY SUPPORT SERVICES. RECUPERATIVE CARE RESPITE CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS PAYING FOR TRANSITIONS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO HOMES OR ASSISTED LIVING. ENVIRONMENTS MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS SO BRING CENTERS AS A REMEDIATION THERE'S A VARIETY OF THOSE SERVICES. ANY IDEA THAT IS TO WRAP BOTH THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND HE'S ADDITIONAL- SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES AROUND A BENEFICIARY- TO ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE IN THE HEALTH ENVIRONMENT AND LEAD HEALTHIER HAPPIER LIVES. SO I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS JUST TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S IN KALANK IS IT'S BIG AND COMPLEX AND YOU KNOW THAT- BUT THE VALUE THAT IT COULD HAVE- ON BENEFICIARIES- SO. LET'S START WITH JUSTICE INVOLVED. MASKING JUST DID REAL BRIEF LIKE. SO IT'S ALSO ON THE GROUND RIGHT SO WOULD TO TRY TO DO THIS WHY BUT HOW ABOUT THE PROVIDER NETWORK IN IN THESE AREAS AND THEN WHEN WE COME TO THE ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT AND CARE SIR WELL EVERYBODY GET THAT ARE JUST AS TARGETED POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN WILL THEY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE HEALTH CARE AS WELL OR JUST THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES OR THE ENHANCE SERVICES IF YOU WILL. GREAT QUESTION SO A FOR ENHANCED- CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDERS REALLY- YOU'RE GOOD IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON WHO THE PROVIDER IS BASED ON THE TARGET POPULATION SO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE WE HAVE THREE TIERS OF THE OF CARE MANAGEMENT WITHIN MEDIC HOUSE WE HAVE- CASE MANAGEMENT WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE IN THE PROGRAM ARE BASED ON THEIR NEEDS AND IS- VERY REGULAR PROVIDED. WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR CONTRACTS AND THAT'S FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE MORE COMPLEX CASES- NEED- ADDITIONAL- CARE COORDINATION SERVICES AND THEN WHAT WE'RE ADDING ON TOP OF THAT IS THE TOP LEVEL OF SERVICE WHICH IS ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT AND THAT IS YOUR TOP HIGHEST- MOST COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS- WHERE YOU WOULD NEED A- CONTRACT WITH PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR EXAMPLE- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OF THE HOMELESS TARGET POPULATION WITH ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT. THAT WOULD IT BE JUST A NORMAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WHO WOULD MOST LIKELY BE THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE- MOST LIKELY A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION OR STREET BASED TEAM WHERE THEY'RE GOING OUT ON ON THE STREET ENGAGING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION BUILDING THAT TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP IN ENSURING THAT ALL OF THEIR MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ETCETERA- SOCIAL SERVICES ARE ARE BEING COORDINATED OF ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND HALF YOUR MANAGEMENT IS THAT. THERE'S ONE PRIMARY CARE MANAGER RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM AT MEDICARE'S REALLY COMPLEX- WE. HAVE ESSENTIALLY SIX TO SEVEN STEP RIGHT DELIVERY SO. IT SEEMS YOU GET IN CAL. YOU'RE GETTING MEDICAL BENEFITS FROM MANAGED CARE PLAN YOU'RE GETTING- IF YOU NEED SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH S. U. D. FROM THE COUNTIES. IF YOU NEED I JUST THAT'S SERVICES WE'RE GETTING THAT SEPARATE- AND SO IT CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING TO NAVIGATE THAT. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS- HI COMPLEX NEEDS ACROSS MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ONE PERSON COORDINATING ACROSS THOSE DELIVERY SYSTEMS WHICH IN THIS CASE COULD INCLUDE COORDINATING THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. I'M NT REALLY TRYING TO TACKLE THAT MOST COMPLEX SO YOU SEE THE PROVIDERS IT COULD BE COUNTIES YOU CAN BE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS WHO ARE DOING THIS TODAY ON WHOLE PERSON CARE. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HOUSING ENTITIES DEPENDING ON THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY- BUT ANYONE WHO. CONTRACTS WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLAN TO PROVIDE ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT HAS TO BE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING IT IN THE COMMUNITY A MEETING THE PERSON WHERE THEY ARE- WHICH COULD YOU CAN INCLUDE IN A IN A CLINICAL OFFICE. BUT IT'S REALLY A HIGHER LEVEL TOUCH. COORDINATION A SERVICE IF THAT HELPS KIND OF. ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. IT DOES THANK YOU. OF COURSE- SO. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S EASY TO KIND OF USE POPULATIONS TO KINDA T. UP- HOW THIS WOULD WORK- IN MEDICARE ALSO WILL TAKE THE JUST AS INVOLVED AS AN EXAMPLE- IN R. KELLY PROPOSAL WE ALLOW FOR. IT I REQUEST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A THIRTY DAY IN REACH BUT WHILE SOMEBODY IS CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. UNDER THE SUPPORT ACT IS WHAT WE WILL BE USING IN OUR REQUEST. I'M TO ALLOW THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- INTO T. TO GO IN AND ASSESS THE INDIVIDUAL- IN ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION UPON REENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY IS AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT SOMEBODY UPON BEING RELEASED ESPECIALLY IF INCARCERATED FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME AND HAVING ANY- COMPLEX MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WILL MOST LIKELY RESULT IN A NUMBER IN THE ROOM VISITS OR IN. STAY SHORTLY BEING. FROM FROM. THIS ALLOW THAT RE. WORK TO START- WE ALSO HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL- ON A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT THAT ALL- JAILS AND IN PRISONS WILL- I SCREEN SOMEONE FOR MEDIC CAL ENROLLMENT UPON RELEASE. I WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE WITH PRESCRIPTIONS- UPON RELEASE FROM FROM JAIL- AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ABOUT THEIR DISPOSAL TO USE IF NECESSARY- AND IF. THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SERVICES- SO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE WAY WHERE WE HAVE- S. ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TOUCH POINTS AND WITHIN CAL AB PROPOSING HOW TO DO THAT. RE ENTRY IT ALSO INCLUDES DIVERSION WHERE WE CAN WORK ON DIVERSION- ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR BEHAVIOR HOLD STAYS. AS WELL AS WITH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT. THE NEXTPOPULATION WOULD BE ARE HOMELESS POPULATION THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS BETWEEN HAVING THE STREET BASED ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT TEAM ON THE GROUND WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS. THERE ARE. A HANDFUL OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT HELP- WITH OUR- HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING HAVING- HUBS WITHIN LARGE URBAN AREAS ON THE GROUND THAT CAN HELP I TARGET INDIVIDUALS FOR SERVICES- PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THEM WHILE THEY'RE STILL HOMELESS- BUT THEN HOPEFULLY CONNECTING THEM. INTO YOU HOUSING NAVIGATION IT PAYS FOR- DEPOSITS AND THEN ONCE THEY ARE HOUSE TENNESSEE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY STATE HOUSE- AND THOSE ARE REALLY CRITICAL AND- COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM BOTH HELP HOMES INTO A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. AND THEN THE LAST ONE THAT'LL GIVE YOU IS- POPULATION- AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW THERE ARE MANY THAT SERVE BY CALLIE IS OUR AGING POPULATION- CALLIN PROVIDES FOR- ONE OF OUR TARGET POPULATIONS AS INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED OR PUT INTO. A LONG TERM CARE ENVIRONMENTS. IT ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE BOTH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BUT AS WELL AS THESE RAP SERVICES NEEDED ON TO KEEP SOMEONE EITHER OUT OF AN INSTITUTION OR SOMEONE WHO IS IN AN INSTITUTION. IF THEY SO CHOOSE ALLOW THEM TO TRANSITION TO THEIR HOME OR AN ASSISTED LIVING ENVIRONMENT WE WOULD PAY THE RAP SERVICES WITHIN IN OUR SEE IF BEARD ARE. YOU A PAPER HOME MODIFICATIONS AT THAT WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR THEM TO BE HOME SAFELY AS WELL AS MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS SO REALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SAFELY RESIDE IN THEIR HOME. BOB AND IT HAS PROVEN A COST SAVINGS AND IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. I BRING IT IN THOSE POPULATIONS BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES A CALLIN IS BAKING COMPLEX AND IT'S HARD TO KIND OF SEE. THE DIRECT IMPACT ON A VERY IS BORN ABOUT POPULATIONS. I THINK THAT WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM COBIT IN REGARDS TO HOW CRITICAL I'M HAVING SOME OF THESE PIECES IN PLACE OF COULD HELP- TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. MOVE THE NEEDLE AND IN SUCH A REAL WAY- I THE STATE OF. IF ANYTHING IT ALONE HIS. HELPED UNDERSCORE THE VALUE OF THE- IN CALAIS- I THINK WHAT WE WOULD ALSO SAY IS- WE ARE NOT A SHY TO THINK THIS IS NOT A LARGE LIFT IT IS A HEAVY LIFT- AND IN. ORDER TO ENSURE SUCCESS WE HAVE PUT IN THE PROPOSAL- INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- AND- REALLY THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE BECAUSE- WE TAKE UP HIGHLIGHTS IF YOU TAKE IT STATEWIDE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED- AND WE HAVE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE SOME OF THESE PILOTS TODAY AND WE NEED TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY IN ACCESS. IN PARTS OF THE STATES WHERE WE CLEARLY JUST DON'T HAVE IT TODAY. ALSO THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE THERE TO DO THAT REALLY TO INCENTIVIZE- WHERE WE I. DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF IN LIEU OF SOURCES OR WE HAVE LOW ACCESS INCREASING OR EVEN IN URBAN AREAS WHERE WE HAD GREAT ACCESS DURING THE PILOT BUT NOT ENOUGH. OF FOR THE DEMAND IN THAT AREA BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE- AND- ALTERNATELY THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT IF WE CAN BUILD STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN PROVE COST EFFECTIVENESS- IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. ULTIMATELY EVEN TRANSITIONING SOME OF THOSE AND GO UP SERVICES INTO A BENEFIT- WHICH CURRENTLY THE WAY IT'S PROPOSED IT IS- IT IS NOT A BENEFIT IT IS- SOMETHING THAT PLAN WOULD HAVE TO OPT INTO A PROVIDING A AND THAT'S HOW WE GET THE FEDERAL AUTHORITY. AND THAT'S REALLY TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT YOU HAVE. STATEWIDE MESSED. UP IN THE OTHER THING I WOULD MENTION A QUICKLY IS WITH THE BUILDING OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO GET YOU MANAGED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR OUR- POPULATIONS. BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN BECAUSE MANY OF THE THINGS OFFERED IN CALLING IN THE A LITTLE SERVICES ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT. REALLY AIMED. AT HAVING SOMEONE BE ABLE TO SEE DEFINITELY LIVE IN THEIR HOME AND PROVIDE. THE LONG TERM SERVICES SINCE THE THAT THEY- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT- IN FUTURE WAIVERS- AND IMPROVING THOSE HAVE HEALTH OUTCOMES- IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING. A SIXTY NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND FORTY SIX LIMITED TERM. EQUIVALENT POSITIONS OF THE COST OF TWENTY FOUR MILLION TOTAL FUNDS ARE ELEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND- AND- I THINK YOU KNOW I. WE KNOW THIS WORK IS COMPLEX- AND THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT ARE INTER DEPENDENT BUT- I THINK WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. HELPS REALLY ODD WILL BETTER SERVE PEOPLE IN OUR PROGRAM TO LIVE KIND LONGER HEALTHIER HAPPIER LIVES AND- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT. YOU MAY HAVE IN REGARDS TO CAL. I THINK WE HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT JUST JUST THAT. UP THE- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SENIORS AND PACE IS NOT IT'S NOT PART OF. GOING TO BE THE PART OF THE CAL AIM OR WILL THE PACE PROGRAM STILL BE A PART OF THAT BECAUSE AT WHAT POINT WOULD PEOPLE TRANSITION BETWEEN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS. WE WOULD OF PACES. IT IS A DIFFERENT IT'S UNDER DIFFERENT RIGHT REGULATIONS SO ARE THERE. DIFFERENT THAN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HOWEVER WE WOULD. ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT TO ENROLL IN A PACE ORGANIZATION. A VERY EFFECTIVE MODEL OF FOR INDIVIDUALS- AND WE WOULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THE- TO THE PEACE PLANS. OKAY MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND- L. A- BEFORE WE GET. MORE TO QUESTIONS DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU LMAO. HEY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF BEN JOHNSON AGAIN- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS IS REALLY WELL SUMMARIZED IN THE HEARING A GENDER CAL AIM IS A SPRAWLING SET OF REFORMS TO EXPAND TRANSFORM AND STREAMLINED MEDICAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND- FINANCING- IT CONTAINS AT LEAST EIGHTEEN MAJOR REFORMS THAT TOUCH ON NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AND SO FAR OUR OFFICE HAS RELEASED YOU AND ALLERGIES THAT ARE PART OF A SERIES OF PUBLICATIONS THAT THAT WILL ANALYZE CALLING THESE TO EXISTING PUBLICATIONS FOCUS ON OVERARCHING ISSUES AS WELL AS FINANCING ISSUES RELATED CAROLINE AND TWO UPCOMING PUBLICATIONS WILL EXPLORE CALENDAR ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH EQUITY. AND AGING- ONE FACET SORT OF LIKE TO RE EMPHASIZE A REITERATE BUT I THINK- DIRECTOR COOPER DID A GREAT JOB OF TOUCHING ON IS THAT WHILE MUCH OF TELLING HIS NEW MUCH OF CALLING WOULD ALSO BUILD UPON OR REPLACE EXISTING AND EXPIRING PROGRAMS. INCLUDING ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT IN THEIR SERVICES AND THE RELATED INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT WOULD GO TO MANAGED CARE PLANS- BUT TELLING DOES NOT REFLECT A MERE CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IT IT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STATE'S APPROACH TO DELIVERING AND FINANCING- THE SERVICES THAT CALTRAIN WILL AIM TO REPLACE. FIRST UNDER KALYAN SIGNIFICAN AND FUNDING RESEARCH FUNDING AND RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE CONCENTRATING SHIFTED OVER TO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. SECOND THE STATE GENERAL FUND WOULD SUPPORT MAJOR NEW TALENT SERVICES TO A MUCH GREATER DEGREE THAN UNDER EXISTING PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE LOCAL FUNDS- PROVIDE A GOOD DEAL OF SUPPORT. WE GENERALLY FIND THE SHIFT TOWARDS THE GENERAL FUND OUT REASONABLE GIVEN CALLUM'S PROPOSED DESIGN OF GOING STATEWIDE AND SHIFTING CONTROL REALLY IN SOME WAYS AWAY FROM THE LOCALS AND TOWARDS MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THEN THIRD THOUGH CALTRAIN WOULD CHANGE- WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE SORT OF WHICH FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCES OR AFFORD THESE THE STATE WOULD USE TO FUND EXPANDED BENEFITS AND THIS WITH A LOCK ON LOCK ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING FOR NON MEDICAL BENEFITS THAT HAVEN'T SORT OF BEEN FUNDED SORT OF. THROUGH THE MEDICAID SORT OF ENTITLEMENT FUNDING STRUCTURE PREVIOUSLY AND IT WOULD AT THE SAME TIME MAKE% FEDERAL FUNDING MORE SUSTAINABLE GIVEN CHANGES TO HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OVERSEEING ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS. WE FIND THAT CALTRAIN HAS POTENTIAL TO BRING MAJOR POLICY BENEFITS FOR EXAMPLE REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES BY FOCUSING RESOURCES AND ATTENTION ON MEDICARE'S HIGHEST HIGHEST RISK IN HIGH SPEED BENEFICIARIES. BUT WE DO HAVE MANY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. FIRST SIGNIFICANT DETAIL ON MAJOR CALLIN COMPONENTS IS LACKING LIMITING THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FULLY SCRUTINIZE. ALL THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED. SECOND WHILE WE FIND THE GOVERNOR'S SOUTH FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND FUNDING PLAN TO GENERALLY BE REASONABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO WE FIND THAT CALTRAIN GIVEN IT SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY. COMES A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL RISKS OVER THE LONG TERM UNFORESEEN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS COULD MATERIALIZE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND ANTICIPATED SAVINGS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE QUICKLY ENOUGH FOR IT SUFFICIENT LEVELS FOR MULTI YEAR FUNDING PLAN TO PROVE REASONABLE. THESE LONG TERM FISCAL RISKS MERIT ESPECIALLY CLOSE ATTENTION GIVEN THE STATE BUDGET PROBLEM ANTICIPATED TO ARISE AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. NOT THIRDS AND DESPITE THESE FISCAL RISKS WE DO BELIEVE CALLIE MERITS CONSIDERATION GIVEN ITS POTENTIAL POLICY BENEFITS IN THE FACT THAT NEW BUT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS- THOSE PROVIDED UNDER WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH HOMES WOULD EXPIRE ABSENT. THEIR CONTINUATION IN SOME FORM SUCH AS IS PROPOSED UNDER CALLIN. JUST CLOSE WITH A FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION OF FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE USE THE BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESS TO RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS- LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM. OR THE PROPOSAL AND PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE INPUT INTO ANY CALLING COMPONENTS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED. SECOND GIVEN THE SCOPE OF CALLANAN THE IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THE STATE IS LIKELY TO FACE AS WE HOPEFULLY EXIT A PANDEMIC OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE EXPLORE WHERE DELAYS IN STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION ARE ADVISABLE. AND THEN THIRD TO ENSURE TELLING HIS ACHIEVING THE STATE'S GOALS WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING ROBUST MECHANISMS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OVERSIGHT AS WELL AS PROGRAM EVALUATION. THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON ASSESSMENTS. OKAY. DIRECTOR WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO ANY OF THOSE BEFORE WE GET INTO QUESTIONS. NO NOT NECESSARILY I MEAN I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT KHALIMOV THE BENEFITS PUT FORWARD ARE REALLY MEANT TO BEND THE COST CURVE- AND TO BE- IN THE OUT YEARS REDUCING OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING ESPECIALLY ROUND INDIVIDUALS WHERE WE SPENT. A LOT OF MONEY- THAT WITH LONG TERM CARE FOR EXAMPLE- I'M INTRANSIGENT HOME SAFELY- WE HAVE PROVEN THROUGH MULTIPLE HOME A COMMUNITY BASED WAIVERS THE EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE TYPES OF TRANSITIONS AS WELL AS IMPROVED OUT OF OUTCOMES. I'M AND THEN FOCUSING ON HOW UTILIZED THERE'S AN INDIVIDUALS WITH- HIGH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS HAS. REALLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THOSE THINGS ARE ARE COST EFFECTIVE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NEW GENERAL FUND COSTS BUT OVERALL REALLY- CAL AND HELPS. YOU KNOW REALLY BEND THE COST CURVE IN THE OUT YEARS- YOU KNOW THAT IS THE INTENT BEHIND MANY OF THE PROPOSALS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ARE. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CALLING FOR MORGAN COUNTY'S WITH THE MANAGED CARE DEPARTMENT DON'T AND DON'T AND- AREN'T INCLUDED AND HOW THEN DO WE GROUP IN THE FEE FOR SERVICES OR- IS THE PLAN EVENTUALLY. TO GET THEM ALL INTO MANAGED CARE PLANS. THE OF THE- PROPOSED OF CHALLENGES TO ACTUALLY- TRANSITION A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR FUTURE SERVICE ENVIRONMENT INTO YOU- MANDATORY MANAGED CARE. I'M SO FOR ALL NON TOOL- POPULATIONS WE PROPOSE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY- TWO I TO MOVE INTO MANAGED CARE AND THAT INCLUDES CERTAIN ZIP CODES FOR EXAMPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STILL ON NOT IN MANAGED CARE- AND THEN WE PROPOSE THE JEWEL POPULATION. I MOVED IN MANDATORY MANAGED CARE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE I'M SO THE KELLY PROPOSAL DOES ACCOUNT FOR MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS MOVING TO. OUR TO MANAGED CARE THE EXCEPTIONS OF LIVES THAT WOULD STAY WITHIN THE FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT IS RESTRICTED SCOPE. AS WELL AS A SHARE OF COST INDIVIDUALS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LONG TERM CARE SHARE OF COST AS THEY OFTEN NEED THEIR SHARE OF COSTS ON ON DAY ONE AND WOULD BE IN MANAGED CARE. SO I'M TELLING DOES ANTICIPATE- THAT BOTH ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT AND LOOK SERVICES- ARE CURRENTLY BENEFITS ONLY PROPOSED WITHIN MANAGED CARE- BUT SINCE WE ARE PROPOSING TO MOVE THE MAJORITY OF A MEDIC CAL LIVES. IN TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE INTO MANAGED CARE. WE DO THINK THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE. DO YOU SEE ANY OF THE SERVICES AS DISCREET IF THE AS THE L. AS MR JOHNSON SAID IF THINGS DROPPER FOR NOT MEETING THE NUMBERS. IF WE HAVE TO PARE BACK AT SOME POINT. WILL DO WE SEE SERVICES AS DISCREET OR- OR DO WE SEE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AS AS WHAT WOULD FALL OFF. BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD FALL OFF. IF WE HAD IF WE HAD A PAIR BACK. I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE ARE MAKE ENHANCE MANAGEMENT A BENEFITTED IS- THERE ARE. FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN REGARDS TO REMOVING A BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS- ENSURING THAT IT WOULDN'T- YOU KNOW. BUT REDUCE OUR HURT OUTCOMES AS WELL AS- MAKING SURE THAT THEY STILL HAVE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO SERVICES- HOWEVER I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW WITH OUR CURRENT- PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND COUNTIES THAT ARE PROVIDING THIS UNDER. EXISTING ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER- I REALLY WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE THE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AS THERE WOULD BE A DRAMATIC- FUNDING CLIFF FOR THOSE COUNTIES I'M A PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IF THERE WAS NOT- AN AVENUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES- WHICH WOULD STILL IMPACT THE STATE BUDGET INCLUDING GENERAL FUND IN REGARDS TO WAYS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. ADDRESS THAT HOLDEN SO- WE STRONGLY THINK THAT- THOSE ADDED SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND WE SHOULD TAKE THEM STATEWIDE- THE EDGE INSURE THAT THERE IS A SUSTAINABLE WAY OF PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE NICE THING ABOUT IN LIEU OF SERVICES BEING OPTIONAL IS IT ALLOWS US TO PHASES IN OVER TIME ALLOWS US TO LEARN WHAT IS WHERE WE'RE FINDING SUCCESSES AND THEN WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE SEE THAT THEY ARE- CLEARLY DEMONSTRATING IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR BENEFICIARIES CAN MAKE DECISIONS OF COURSE WITH THE LEGISLATURE- IN REGARDS TO MAKING THOSE. THOSE BENEFITS- SO I THINK WE TRIED TO OF PHASE IN WE'VE TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE TYPES TRANSITIONS WILL NOT CREATING. UNNECESSARY CLIFFS WERE KEY PARTNERS- IN OUR MEDIC CAL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND HE DID DO THIS AS AS APPROPRIATELY AS WE CAN- WELL WE TAKE IT STATEWIDE. AND PETER GUBER BOUT THE INCENTIVE PAY. FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT IS THEN THE INCENTIVIZE IS TICKETS TO GO TO THE ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT CORRECT. YES OF THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE REALLY TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE- IN THE STATE FOR BOTH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT WHERE DOESN'T EXIST TODAY AS WELL AS THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO WITH THE INCENTIVES IS SAYING YOU KNOW. IF YOU CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTY WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT. RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS FOR EXAMPLE ARE REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS YOU I'M GOING TO IN PATIENT CARE OFTEN CAN LINGER IN AN INPATIENT BED FOR. WEEKS AND SOMETIMES MONTHS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT APPROPRIATELY TRANSITION SOMEBODY TO THE STREET GIVEN THEIR CURRENT HEALTH CONDITION. THAT ALLOWS SOMEONE TO TRANSITION FROM THAT IMPATIENCE DAY- INTO A RECUPERATIVE CARE BEDS SO THE INCENTIVES WOULD BE AROUND BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL. OF THE ALSO WOULD FOCUS ON CERTAIN OUTCOMES SO INCREASING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES- TO ENSURE THAT WERE GETTING- THE PENETRATION THAT WE WANT IT WOULD IT COULD INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRAINING INITIATIVES FOR ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT. IN ORDER TO DO ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL WHERE WE WORK WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND PEERS. BOB AND IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT THEY HAVE TRAINING MECHANISM SO WE CAN INCENTIVIZE- THESE TRAINING. INITIATIVES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN REGARDS TO THAT WORKFORCE- EFFORTS- THAT WOULD BE. NEEDED AS WELL AS ACTUAL QUALITY OUTCOMES WILL HAVE MEASURES FOR EXAMPLE ON AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THINGS WHERE WE WANT TO CLOSE GAPS FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT THE THERE'S A HIGHER PROPORTION OF A BLACK AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS- COMPARED TO. THE NUMBER IN THE IN THE STATE- AND SO. YOU KNOW WE'RE- THE NUMBER OF IN ARE. THE NUMBER OF- BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RECEIVING ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE ARE EXPLORING WITH THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS PROPOSED IN CALAIS. OKAY CAN YOU I MEAN JUST SO TELL ME TELL ME A STORY OKAY SO LET'S SAY WE HAVE A HIGH NEEDS INDIVIDUAL RIGHT NOW ON OUR TRADITIONAL MANAGED CARE MEDICAL. OKAY AND THEN AND THEN DESCRIBE TO ME WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM I GREW UP WITH THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT THEY COME IN WHAT OTHER ISSUES ARE FACING AND THEN WHERE DO THEY FALL OFF OR WERE THEY NOT GET SERVED. AND HOW WAS THAT PAYMENT DELIVERED. AND THEN CONVERSELY. THE BEAUTIFUL FUTURE THAT WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS. HER SO- TAKEN INDIVISIBLE AS YOU THE HIGH UTILIZED- OKAY- SO YOU'RE A HIGH UTILIZE OR- YOU KNOW I HAD. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S COMING INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS- AND WE DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN HAVE MULTIPLE OR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS- AND IN A MONTH. MAYBE THEY'VE HAD AN INPATIENT STAY OR TO- BUT THEY KEEP CYCLING THROUGH THROUGH THE SYSTEM CLEARLY. THEY ARE NOT BEING CONNECTED. TO THE ACTUAL DELIVERY SYSTEM TO HAVE WHATEVER MEDICAL CONDITIONS USUALLY BEING DRIVEN BY. A NUMBER OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS- FOR THEM- AND THAT IS VERY COSTLY- BOTH TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A MANAGED CARE PLAN. ON IN IF NOT IDENTIFIED EARLY YOU KNOW. REALLY CAN- HAVE AN ISSUE. IN CALAIS. WHAT WE PROPOSE IS THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR STRATIFICATION PROCESS IN PLACE WHERE HIGH UTILIZES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BE IDENTIFIED I THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLAN- AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A HAND OFF- THE REFERRAL CAN COME FROM A PROVIDER FROM THE MANAGED CARE PLAN FOR THE BENEFITS YOU'RE THEMSELVES- OR FAMILY MEMBER. WHO SAYS THIS INDIVIDUAL- NEEDS CARE TO ENHANCE YOUR MANAGER. OFTENTIMES HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE REALLY KEY PLAYERS IN REGARDS TO THE HIGH UTILIZED- I'M ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER IN THIS CASE THEY WOULD. ENGAGE WITH THAT NDIVIDUAL FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HAVE SOMEONE IN BED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM SO THAT IF YOU HAVE A HIGH UTILIZE- YOU CAN CONNECT WITH THEM. YOU CAN BUILD TRUST AND THEN YOU CAN START ENSURING THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED ON THE OUT PATIENT PERSPECTIVE AND NOT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IF IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY. SO THEY WOULD HELP COORDINATE AND ENSURE- YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THIS MAYBE THEY'RE DIABETIC CAN HAVE ON PEOPLE UNCONTROLLED DIABETES- THEY'D BE WORKING WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS TO GET IN TO SEE THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER GET THEM ANY- SPECIALTY- ANCILLARY SERVICES THAT THEY NEED- AND MAYBE THAT THEY'RE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH. ANXIETY DEPRESSION OR SOMETHING ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE INSURING THAT THEY'RE GETTING COORDINATED WITH THOSE SERVICES. AND IF THE INDIVIDUAL HAPPENS TO ALSO BE HOMELESS AND EMERGENCY ROOM INDIVIDUAL THAT ENHANCE YOUR MANAGER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENGAGING THEM TO SEE IF THEY WANT TO EXPLORE BEING HOUSE THAT. PROCESS TAKES TIME IT TAKES RUST- AND SO HAVING IN A DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL- THAT CAN HELP WITH THAT HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES I'M CONNECTING THEM TO THE END GOAL OF SERVICE PROVIDER. I'M WORKING TO GET THAT DEPOSIT AND GET THEM IN THEIR HOUSE AND ONCE THEIR HOUSE I WORKING WITH THEM TO STAY HOUSE BY A LEAKING ON WITH THAT TENDENCY SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. THAT'S OFFERED IN CALLING THAT'S KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE WORK TO DATE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN IN MANAGED CARE PLANS. BIG CALL THE INDIVIDUAL AND SAY EIGHT WE KNOW THAT. USING THE EMERGENCY WERE A LOT OF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THAT'S ALWAYS NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS- ON THE GROUND. IN THE IN THE EITHER THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN THE PROVIDER OFFICE ARE HOMELESS ON THE STREET AND GAUGING WITH SOMEONE. AT TO BUILD A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP THAT ALLOWS YOU TO KIND OF MOVE THE NEEDLE- I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF. RUNNING ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT OF PROGRAMS IN MY CAREER- IT'S HARD TO ENGAGE A CERTAIN POPULATIONS- SO THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THOSE WHO JUST DON'T ENGAGE- BUT IF YOU CAN. SEE THAT THAT ENGAGEMENT IF YOU CAN INVOLVE SOMEBODY IN THEIR CARE. CONNECT THEM TO THE OUTPATIENT SERVICES GET THEM INTO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED FOR CONNECTED WITH- HOUSING OR OTHER SERVICES- WE HAVE SHOWN ACROSS THE STATE- THROUGH BOTH PILOTS AND OTHER INITIATIVES. YOU REALLY CAN'T REDUCE THE HIGH COST EMERGENCY ROOM INPATIENT STAYS YOU CAN REALLY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. I TAUGHT PRACTICED FOR YEARS I TAUGHT PRACTICE I TAUGHT THERE IN I WOULD TELL STUDENTS ALL THE TIME YOU CAN DO ANY KIND OF FANCY THING YOU WANT BUT IF YOU CAN'T BUILD A RELATIONSHIP. NOTHING ELSE REALLY MATTERS. CAN YOU TELL ME THOUGH THE FUNDING STREAMS FOR THAT THAT FIRST RIGHT SO HOW IS A MANAGED CARE. BEING FUNDED AND THEN AND THEN. AND THEN PAYING A PROVIDER'S. IN THE TRADITIONAL FORM THAT WE'RE USING NOW AND HOW IS THAT GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT IN THE NEW FORM FOR FUNDING PURPOSES. FOR THE TODAY THE WAY WE PAY FOR CASE MANAGEMENT WE PAY A MANAGED CARE PLANS- WITHIN THEIR CAPITATION RATES. OF FOUR BOWS HE'S MEASURING COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT AND THEN THEY CONTRACT WITH- A VARIETY OF PROVIDERS. I'M TO PROVIDE SERVICES SOME OF WHICH MAY BE- PROVIDING THE CARE COORDINATION ON THEIR BEHALF- AND THAT'S BUILT IN. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO IN CALAIS FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT THEY WOULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS- FOR ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD GO TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN. BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAR CONTRACTUAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY CONTRACT. OUT SO SOME MANAGED CARE- PLANS TODAY DO THE CASE MANAGE. COM CASE. THEMSELVES WHERE THEY- A NURSES OR CLINICAL STAFF WHO ARE CALLING IN DOING OUTREACH TO INDIVIDUALS. UNDER ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- WE MAY ALLOW FOR SOME PORTIONS TO STAY WITHIN MANAGED CARE PLAN BUT REALLY THIS IS ABOUT COMMUNITY BASED. INDIVIDUALS ARE PROVIDERS COUNTIES PUBLIC HEALTH THE- DEPARTMENT OR PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITALS- ENGAGING IN THAT CARE SO THEY WOULD CONTRACT WITH THAT ENTITY- THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY PAY THEM A PM PM THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN MOST OF OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- AND THAT WOULD BE TO ENGAGE WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS. UP AND PAY THEM TO DO SO- SO IT'S SEPARATE APART FROM THE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE BUILT ON IT WOULD BE A DIRECT PAYMENTS TO THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER. I'M AND THAT'S BUILT INTO THE SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PUT IN THE BUDGET FOR ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT. FOR IN LIEU OF SERVICES SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A PRETTY BIG INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE NEW OF SERVICES BUILT UP THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE. WE HAVE PUT FUNDS INTO THE BUDGET- TO ENSURE THERE'S NO CLIFF. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO FALL OFF WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FUND THOSE- BUT THEN OVER TIME AS MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDE. MORE IN IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT IS THE HOPE- ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE'S NOT SOME TODAY- AFTER THAT GETS BUILT INTO THEIR RATE PROCESS SO THEY WILL WE WILL RECEIVING COUNTER DATA IT WILL R. C. GREAT DATA FROM THE MASTER PLAN OF WHAT THAT'S COSTING- AND THAT GETS BUILT INTO THEIR FUTURE RATE- ALSO WHICH- GETS BUILT INTO THEIR RATE. IS YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE SEEING THAT THE- IT'S REDUCING THE INPATIENT AND ER UTILIZATION WE HAVE WITHIN OUR CALIBER POSTAL SHARED SAVINGS PROPOSAL. THAT AS WE START SEEING THOSE INPATIENT AND ER UTILIZATION DECREASES- THAT IN THE OUT YEARS WE WOULD SHARE IN THOSE SAVINGS WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- SO. THEY THEY HAD A REDUCTION- WHERE YOU'RE PAYING I'M. JUST GONNA USE EASY NUMBERS A HUNDRED DOLLAR THERE'S- YOU KNOW FOR SOME. AND THEY ABLE TO. THE COST EIGHTY- WE WOULD SHARE IN THAT- THAT THAT SO THAT THEY COULD REINVEST IN EXPANSION OF APPROPRIATE. DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AND SO WE HAVE KIND OF. PROPOSED BOTH A REQUIREMENT THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLAN CONTRACTOR ACTUALLY WITH PROVIDERS ARE KEEPING SOME INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE PLAN LEVEL BUT MOST OF IT BEING COMMUNITY BASED. ON IN PERSON- TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS- AND THEN WE WILL BUILD IN THE A LITTLE SERVICES COST OVER TIME INTO THE RATE AND SHARE IN THE SAVINGS OF THE REDUCE UTILIZATION. NO THEY'RE NOT THE WHOLE PERSON PLANS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE THE PILOTS FOR ABOUT. FIVE YEARS APPROXIMATELY BRENT YEAH RIGHT. YEAH WE'RE IN THE SIX YOU'RE TECHNICALLY BUT IT TOOK TIME TO GET THEM UP AND RUNNING SO- I THINK WEARING YOUR FOR OF OPERATIONALLY PAYING FOR THE SERVICES YEAH. OKAY SO I KNOW MY COUNTY AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY ARE BOTH ARE BOTH PART OF IT. AND NOW IT. YOU KNOW WHEN I AND I WOULD JUST OFFER THE LAST FIVE YEARS I THINK PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE PROBLEMS HAVE INCREASED. AS FAR AS THE VISUAL PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT HOMELESS ON THE STREET. A LACK OF HOUSING ALL OF THOSE THINGS. SO IF IN THE TWO COUNTIES THAT I'M BY DRIVE IN EVERY DAY. I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING. TELL ME HOW THIS TELL ME HOW CONTINUING ON THIS IS GOING TO HELP YOU THE MORE FOR WHAT WE'VE BEEN MISSING. IN THE WHOLE PERSON PLANS BEFORE. SO I THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS WHAT WHOLE PERSON CARE TO PILOT SO EACH COUNTY WAS ABLE TO PICK DIFFERENT TARGET POPULATIONS- AND PICK DIFFERENT INITIATIVES- AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH CALLIE. IS LOOK ACROSS THE PROGRAMS OF WHAT WE'RE THE BEST PRACTICES WHAT WE'RE THE BEST- A PACKAGE OF SERVICES- BUNDLED TOGETHER- THAT. REALLY ALLOWED US TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE ENDED UP PUTTING INTO CALLING- I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE- THE THINGS WITH PILOTS IS. EVERYBODY'S TESTING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND A COMBINATION OF THINGS. AND SO BY HAVING THE FULL PACKAGE OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES THE NAVIGATION THE DEPOSITS. THE TNDENCY AS WELL AS RECUPERATIVE CARE. I'M IN OTHER PIECES YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE FULL CONTINUUM. I'M AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY HOPING IS THAT. PEOPLE WILL EMBRACE THAT CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT ALLOWS YOU HAVE THE STEP DOWN AND REALLY MAXIMIZE THE SCENES- AND I ALSO THINK THAT. A LOT OF THE STUFF AND WHOLE PERSON CARE IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT VULNERABLE. IS IT IS DEPENDENT ON LOCAL FUNDING- AND- IN BEAUTY I TO DRIVE TO- SUSTAINABILITY TO DRIVE TO STATEWIDE IS. GOING THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WHERE THERE ARE CLEAR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS NO LONGER A PILOT. SUBJECT TO LOCAL FUNDING- WE ARE THERE WOULD BE EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE THAT THERE WOULD BE MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY- AND TRACKING OF THOSE PIECES AND SO I THINK. THAT'S WHY WE PROPOSED THE STRUCTURE AND THE CHANGE FROM A LOCAL- KIND OF FUNDED INITIATIVE- THAT'S PILOTED AND BERRIES AND ONLY MAYBE HAS CERTAIN COMPONENTS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES- TO. A MORE STATE WIDE SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS FOR- YES INVESTMENT IN GENERAL FUND BUT ULTIMATELY A MORE KIND OF. IMPROVE OUTCOME- WHAT WE PULLED THE BEST PRACTICES WE CAN'T FROM. WHERE WE HAVE SEEN GREAT SUCCESS IN THE STATE. OKAYAND THEN JUST ONE. FINAL QUESTION FOR I TURN TO DOCTOR PANEL- CENTER MELENDEZ- SO I. MEAN I WAS IN THE NINETIES IN I WAS PART OF A OF VALUE. LOOKING AT THIS. THIS CALL. IN IN- IN OREGON- BUT CHAO WELFARE SYSTEM. SO WE WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE PILOTS FOREVER RIGHT WILL WE REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T JUST TREAT ONCE WHEN PART OF A PERSON WE HAVE TO TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM. THAT THEY LIVE IN- SO WHY ARE WE READY NOW RIGHT WE'VE BEEN TRYING THIS FOR EVER AND THEN STARTS AND FITS AND PILOTS AND- PILOTS AND- AND NOW WE'RE READY. THANK WELL I WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. WELL WE'VE BEEN DOING THE PILOTS FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESSFUL PILOTS AS WELL- AND TAKING THAT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS- IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE. MAKING THESE SERVICES BUT I THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF BRINGING THE MEDICAL AND THE SOCIAL SIDE- IN LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERSON THE VALUE OF THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK- NOW WILL THE MOMENT IT'S CLEAR I THINK. I CAN'T EVEN STRESS THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE'VE HAD THROUGH CODED IN REGARDS TO THERE'S BEEN MOMENTS WHERE WE'RE SAYING IF WE REALLY JUST HAD CALAIS MAINE PLACE. THINK ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO THE HOMELESS THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MOVE QUICKLY ON THE HOUSING COMPONENTS IN HERE- WE HAVE TO START BUILDING- BE INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE NOW WE HAVE TO FIND WHERE THERE ARE GAPS- TO START MOVING THE NEEDLE BECAUSE IF WE JUST KEEP PUTTING IT OFF I THINK THAT. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE- THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INCREASE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE. AN INCREASE OF- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S SUICIDE RATES OR INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH- ISSUES THAT ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED I THINK WE HAVE TO KIND TO INVEST THE FUNDS NOW TO START SEEING CHANGES OUT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND IT WILL TAKE TIME IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT- BUT I THINK THAT NOW. IS REALLY CRITICAL ESPECIALLY- WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND HAVING THESE PIECES. THE CONNECTION OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL- REALLY I HIGHLIGHTED- INVALIDATING THAT IS CRITICAL. AT THIS TIME AND THE PLANTS ARE READY. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT- THE PLANS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDE SERVICES PLANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR US TO IMPLEMENT FOR HER YEARS. OF BECAUSE OF THE LEARNING THEIR RIGHT ESPECIALLY AROUND THE AGING POPULATION AND HOW- SUCCESSFUL CAN BE AT REDUCING COSTS. I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WE ARE PUTTING INCENTIVE DOLLARS IN TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE. REALLY TIGHT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND WE WILL WE WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO MOVE THE NEEDLE BUT- I'VE YET TO HEAR PLAN SAY THAT DAY- PART EXCITED ABOUT TELLING. IT'S MORE OF WHY WE PUT PHASING IN PLACE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. IN DOING THIS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME INSTEAD OF EVERYTHING GOING ON AT ONCE. THANK YOU. DOCTOR THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I DO HAVE- SEVERAL QUESTIONS. SO SHE GIVEN THE SCOPE OF- THE PROPOSAL- I OWE IT ALL TO MAKE NOTE THAT- I DO REMEMBER DE UM. THE FIRM THE NATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS AND- WELL THERE MAY BE AN OUT THERE ARE SUCCESSES ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- AND- WE DID HAVE PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS- BUT I DO I SAY THAT IS. OVERALL AND A JUST EXPRESS YOU KNOW GENERAL SUPPORT FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT- ONE OF THINGS THAT I. THINK OVERALL- THERE'S A LOT THAT'S BEING EXPECTED OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND ARE AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST STATEMENT IS THAT- ONE THING THAT'S GONNA BE ESSENTIAL TO MAKING THE SUCCESSFUL IS- OVERSIGHT- AND CUT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS AND THIS IS- BEFORE YOUR TIME ON THIS COOPER BUT- THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE THE SIMPLY COMMITTEE AND THEN LATER HERE IN THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW- BUT I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT WE CAN'T CONTRACT OUT RESPONSIBILITY. SO THAT THE AGENCY NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO US AND- I NEVER WANT TO HEAR THAT WELL THE PLAN DID THAT. IT WASN'T US BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES WHO MADE THE CONTRACT WOULD WANT TO SIGN THE CONTRACT INCLUDING ANY CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN THE CONTRACT FOR FAILURE STEP WITH. THAT MAY HAPPEN AND- SO I JUST WANTED. FIRST OF ALL MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A MANAGED CARE PLAN DO IT- WE STILL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OUTCOMES- DIRECTLY. CAN'T BLAME THE PLAN NOW THE PLAN MAY HAVE HAD SOME FAULT BUT AGAIN WE'RE THE ONES WITH CON WE'RE THE ONES WHO MADE CONTRACT- SO FIRST OF ALL- RIGHT. ONE QUESTION IS- PART OF WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO INCLUDE ESSENTIALLY LONG TERM CARE AND LTSS SERVICES INTO THE MANSION CARE- ESSENTIALLY CARVE THE MEN AND THE MANAGED CARE BENEFIT. WE ESTABLISH OUR CAPITATION RATES- FOR THE DIFFERENT PLANS LONG TERM CARE IS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- AND- SO. IS THERE SEPARATE CAPITATION RATE FOR THE PEOPLE AND WHO REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES FROM THE REST OF THE POPULATION- IN THAT PLAN ARE THERE SOME WAYS SO THAT WE CAN TEAR THAT OUT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG- WE MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURES FOR SOMEONE REQUIRES LONG TERM CARE SERVICES IS MUCH HIGHER THAN LET'S SAY A CHILD OR A WORKING ADULT AND SO FORTH AND- IF WE ONLY GIVE ONE. OVERALL CAPITATION RATE- YOU COULD WE COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE SEE BASICALLY THE PLANS DRIVEN BY- THAT ONE POPULATION AND- THE OTHER POPULATIONS PERHAPS BEING EVEN SHORTAGE BECAUSE IF IT IF IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL THE BOOKS WORK OUT. SO I JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T CREATE A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT BASICALLY- CREATES- DYSFUNCTIONAL IT SAID WELL I GUESS INCENTIVE TO CREATE. THAT DRIVES DECISION MAKING THAT- THAT THAT MAY- NOT NECESSARILY- BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION AND- SO NOT UNITING THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A SUB SEGMENT THAT HAS IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE STAND OTHER. GROUPS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE- WHAT'S WRITTEN ONE WAY SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO HOW HOW HOW HOW WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THE PAYMENTS. FOR CARVING IN LONG TERM CARE- INTO IT HI HOW ARE YOU PLANNING TO ESTABLISH OUR- CAPITA PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS. BURKE SO- I WOULD THINK WOULD SAY IS DO HAVE PLANS TO HAVE LONG TERM CARE CARVED INTO DAY- IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY SO WE DO HAVE EXPERIENCE FROM FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- WE ARE PROPOSING A BLENDED RATE WITH LONG TERM CARE AND S. B. THE SPD POPULATION. IF THERE'S QUESTIONS WEARING THAT I KNOW IN THE HERINGTON IS ON AND SHE CAN SPEAK TO THOSE THE ONE THING I WOULD SAY THOUGH RIGHT NOW OF WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVE FROM THE HOT- HEALTHCARE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN LONG TERM CARE IS CARVED IN AND WE PROVIDE THEM DELUDE SERVICES THAT ALLOW THEM TO TRANSITION SOMEONE FROM A LONG TERM CARE ENVIRONMENT INTO A HOME OR ASSISTED LIVING- WITH WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW HOW MODIFICATIONS OR- MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS- IT'S A LOT. A LOT LESS BECAUSE- I WOULD BE COVERED OUR AND CUT SOMEONE OUT OF ME IS. NOT YEAH I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CARVING THEM OUT I'M TALK ABOUT THE POPULATION SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR- YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO WHO EITHER NEED LONG TERM CARE SERVICES ARE. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE CAPITATION RATE THAN LETTING A CHILD WHO'S ON. SOME POSSIBILITY BUT MUCH LESS LIKELY TO NEED THOSE SERVICES RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE WE HAVE DIFFERENT RISK STRATIFICATION WITHIN THE POPULAR MEDICARE POPULATION. RIGHT SO WHAT SO YOU HAVE A POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR THE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES AND YOU DO WANT HIM TO SAY HEY LOOK YOU KNOW WHAT INSTEAD OF. PUTTING HER IN A NURSING HOME WE CAN DO MEDICAL MEALS OR DO ALL MODIFICATION AND THAT MAKES SENSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU TAKE IF WE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE AT HIGH MUCH HIGHER RISK FOR FAIRLY EXPENSIVE SERVICES AND WE MIX THEM IN WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T. THEN SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET SOME SOME NOTES ESSENTIALLY SOME SORT OF RISK BASED PAYMENT. RELATED TO THAN THAT OF POTENTIAL RISK OF NEED FOR LONG TERM CARE SO WE DON'T. BASICALLY HAVE A PLAN THAT GOES AND SITS BACK AND SAYS WELL YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S DRIVING OUR EXPENSES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT AND THEN WE- WILL SUBSIDIZE IT WITH BECAUSE- WITH. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOUGH LESSON ITSELF I JUST WANNA BE SURE IT AND TALK ABOUT POPULATION STRATIFICATION. OF TALK ABOUT CARVING OUT. YEAH NO I AM. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE DO HAVE A SEPARATE- CATEGORY OF AID FOR THE LONG TERM CARE. I'M GOING TO ASK LINDA IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION TO SENATOR PAN IN REGARDS TO YOU- HOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO BUILD THE- RATE FOR THE LONG TERM CARE THAT. THAT MAY GIVE HIM SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE DOING THERE. SURE WINNER PAN JUST SAID IT JUST TO CONFIRM FREE WE DO HAVE SEPARATE RATES THAT WE PROVIDED THE MANAGED CARE PLANS. BASED ON THE POPULATION FROM FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SEPARATE TRIALS IN ORDER SEPARATE ADULT RATE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN A RATE THAT WE PROVIDE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE. FOR INDIVIDUALS. WITH LONG TERM CARE NEEDS WE ARE PROPOSING COULD YOU A BLENDED. RATE ARE THERE ANY WITH YOUR- BUT THE- IN ORDER TO GROW SOME THEIR SHARED SAVINGS- WHERE WE CAN SOME INCENTIVE TO ENSURE THAT ARE GET. THAT THE RIGHT ARE HERE OKAY. SURE THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY. OKAY WELL IF IT PERHAPS YOU CAN YOU SOME DE- ON THAT WE DON'T NEED TO GO TO ALL DETAILS RIGHT HERE IN THE- THE- I WOULD. THE OTHER QUESTION- HERE THE UNDER PART OF THE PROPOSED IS. THAT YOU WILL RECALL ALL MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS BE CREATED BY NCQA BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX- NOW MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ON HWY. TWENTY TWENTY SIX WENT OUT EARLIER BUT THEN ALSO IT STATE THAT DTS AND OVER LONGER CONDUCT INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS- SO I GUESS WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT- SO WHAT KIND OF STANDARDS ARE IS OF YOU GOING TO DEFER TO NCQA. FOR THOSE AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DO- THE OVERSIGHT OVER OTHER REQUIREMENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS FOR THE PLANS- ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE GIVING THEM MORE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY OKAY WELL. GOOD DEAL YOU GET THE MODEL CREATED BY NCQA WHAT HAPPENS. THE PLAN FALLS SHORT DO WE LEAVE THE PENALTY TO NCQA ARE- LIKE SO. I MEAN I GUESS OF THE LOST ACCREDITATION I GUESS YOU COULD JUST NOT USE THAT PLAN ALTHOUGH. I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WORKS IF IT'S A CLOSE OR IT'S A- YOU KNOW. IT'S ONE OF THE TWO PLANS DO YOU JUST SIMPLY ON THEY'LL FIND A SECOND PLANTS- CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT. HOW THIS IN C. Q. A ACCREDITATION IS GOING TO WORK PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO IT'S EITHER A FILTRATION OR- THE DON'T MEET AND THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY LOS REFRIGERATION BUT THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE SOME FAILURES IN MEETING THAT DO WE JUST LEAVE IT AND SEE Q. A. R. DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANS THAT DO NOT MEET THE NCQA. REQUIREMENTS BUT NOT TO THE GREEK OR NCQA. ITSELF MAY REMOVE THEIR ACCREDITATION. SO WE ARE WE ARE PROPOSED TO HAVE THE ACCREDITATION BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX THE REASON WHY. I WE NEEDED THAT LONG AS WE DID WORK WITH THE NCQA AND PLANS HAVE ALREADY BECOME ACCREDITED IN REGARD TO THE TIMELINE THAT IT TAKES A FROM REQUIRE ME TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS TO GET FULL ACCREDITATION AND SO. THAT'S THE TIME PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE HAS TO BE FULLY ACCREDITED BY JUST A CLEAR BY THAT POINT- AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S THE LATER YEARS THERE. FOR THE POINT AROUND AT WHAT WE CALL DEEMING- IN REGARDS TO USING NCQA ACCREDITATION- ONCE. ABOUT SIXTEEN I BELIEVE OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE CURRENTLY NCQA ACCREDITED SO IT JUST BE THE GAP THERE- BUT WE CURRENTLY DON'T DO ANY DEEMING. TODAY OTHER THAN CREDENTIALING WHERE WE DO WOULD DEEM TO- NCQA FOR CREDENTIALING IN CALIFORNIA TODAY- WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE- SOME NCQA DEEMING AND BY THAT I MEAN IT WHERE WE WOULD HAVE AND C. Q. A. B. THE MAIN SOURCE. OF THE REVIEW FOR THOSE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE. FUNCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER WE DO PROPOSED TO HAVE FULL TRANSPARENCY AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AROUND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD DEEM. TO NCQA VERSUS WHAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO DO TO OUR ON GOING ON OVERSIGHT MONITORING- SO WE DO WANT TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FUTURE. I DEPENDING ON WHAT WE RECOMMEND THERE HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT TAKE AWAY ANY OF THE STATE'S ABILITY TO STILL HOLD MANAGED CARE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. IF FOR SOME REASON A MANAGED CARE PLAN- LOST ACCREDITATION FIRST BEFORE YOU JUST LOSE IT YOU GO INTO THEIR STAGES OF THAT. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD INTERVENE QUICKLY AND EARLY IN REGARDS TO ANY. OPPONENTS THAT ARE WITHIN THE DINNING AREA BUT WE ALSO WOULD PUT OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IMMEDIATELY ON CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. A AND- UTILIZE THE SANCTIONS IF NECESSARY- IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE AND JEOPARDY OF SUCH A LOSS OF ACCREDITATION SO. A LOT WE DO WANT TO INCREASE THE STANDARDIZATION ACROSS ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WITH NCQA ACCREDITATION SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW COVER CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS WHO HAVE NCQA ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS- IT WOULD NOT. IT WOULD NOT PROHIBIT THE DEPARTMENT FROM ALL. OVERSIGHT AND REQUIREMENTS- AS WELL AS FULLTRANSPARENCY IN REGARDS TO ANY AREAS THAT WE DO GOING TO NCQA. VERSES PUTTING OUR RESOURCES THAT WERE OTHERWISE LOOKING AT CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS TO- YOU KNOW REALLY FOCUSING ON FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING- IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY. I DELIVERY SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION EQUITY OKAY. SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION OKAY CERTAINLY AND- IT'S NOT THE ISSUE WHEN YOU SAID- THAT- IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE- AGENCY FROM ACTING I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT- THAT THE AGENCY AND DEEMING AND DIMMING IS FINALLY HAVE A- YOU KNOW AN ORGANIZATION LIKE AND SECURE WAY- THE- BUT- THAT- THAT. THE POLICY DOESN'T BECOME A- WELL SINCE WE'VE DECIDED TO DEEM THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT RIGHT SO THAT YES THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT. THE SYSTEM ACTING AS WANNA DCS WHACKED. OUT AND NOT JUST SIMPLY SAY WELL WE'VE WE IS NOW THE SITE THE DMZ AND SECURITY SO WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE ANYMORE- SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T BECOME PART OF THE CULTURE- THAT- IN TERMS OF THE- THE- THE MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEIR VIEWS- YOU. KNOW PUBLIC TO TRANSPARENCY. AROUND THE TEAM PROCESS. READ MANAGED RATES- US UNDERSTAND- PART OF FOR YOU'RE TRYING TO THAT HE DESCRIBED- WE I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WE DO KNOW WHAT TO BE. ARE ARE YOU GOING TO USE TO COVER CALIFORNIA REGIONS WHAT KIND OF REGION'S ARE YOU USING. TO SELL US REGIONAL MANAGED CARE RATE SETTING- I'M GONNA LET ALLEN THE HEARING AN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. GIVE. YES WE ARE WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH WHAT THOSE REGIONS WILL LOOK LIKE- AND WHAT WE WILL MATCH THAT UP WITH WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH TO TRY TO DETERMINE BASED ON THAT THE MACRO INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TODAY I'M SURE THAT. THERE'S REGION POPULAR COST PROFILE SIMILAR EXPERIENCE I'M INTO WORKING IN YOUR WORK AND WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN PARTNERS ACTUALLY ESTABLISH THOSE YOU ENSURE THAT THAT THERE ARE- YOU KNOW MY NAY AND ARE APPROPRIATIONS YEAH SO CERTAINLY THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM- THERE'RE. SAMPLE SACRAMENTO SINCE OUR REGIONAL AREA. AS A AS A RULE AREA. WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT RAY ROLE AND SO ARE STRUCTURE IN PAIN AT MEDICARE ARE. BECAUSE OF AND SO. AND PART OF IT BECAUSE YOU GUYS. BACK KNOW DECADES AGO SO AND SO WE COME TO READ MANAGER CARE RATES I THINK PART OF IT CERTAINLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THOSE REGIONS ARE GOING TO BE- SO WHY KNOW HOW THOSE REASONS MIGHT OF ALL OVER TIME- REFLECTING POTENTIALLY POPULATION SHIFTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT. WILL COURSE CAPITA PER TIME DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS AND SO FORTH. SO THINK WE NEED A MUCH MORE DETAIL ON THAT- AND THEN- NOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT- SO AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE PERCENT THE YOU HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE- TARGET POPULATIONS COULD SO HE JUST SPEAK TO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OUR THIRTEEN. MILLION POINT WHATEVER MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE ON MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD ACTUALLY. QUALIFY FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT. HOW MANY OF THEM. SO WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT PERCENT OF WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT. ABOUT A ROUGH PERCENT I GOT NO EXIT OKAY SO WHAT. WE'RE TALKING TEN TWENTY THIRTY IT'S CLOSE 210% NO IT SHOULD BE THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT IS FOR YOUR TOP HIGHEST- WHETHER IT'S UTILIZED THERE'S OR MOST COMPLEX INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FACING KIND OF ON BOTH THE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL- DRIVERS A OF HEALTH SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY- IT'S EASY TO PUT. UP PERCENT ON WHICH IS WHY WE TYPICALLY DON'T GIVE UP PERCENT OKAY THAT IT'S GOING TO VERY BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TARGET POPULATIONS- AND ONE THING I WOULD JUST MENTION IS. JUST THE THOSE THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE THE NUMBER THAT ENGAGE IS A VERY DIFFERENT NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND SO THAT'S WHY. IT'S HARD FOR THE DEPARTMENT BUT- WELL IT OKAY I YOU CAN GIVE THESE. NUMBER BUT I THINK SCALE IS IMPORTANT RIGHT SO AND FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WHEN THE TARGET POPULATIONS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS OR HOMELESS. RIGHT AND BY THE WAY THEY'RE HARD TO REACH SO. WHEN WE'RE DOING CONTRACTS MANAGED CARE PLANS- WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE THEM CONTRACT RIGHT FOR THE POPULATION AND THEN NOT DO SUFFICIENT OUTREACH AND THEN BASICALLY OKAY SO YOU KNOW WE GOT A SO I THINK HAVING A NUMBER OF HAVING AT LEAST AND RANGE IS IMPORTANT SO AND SO I'M JUST THINKING SKILLS SO WE TALK ABOUT THE TOP ONE PERCENT. THE TOP 3% THE TOP 5% TOP 10% THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING WE'RE ONLY GOING TO DO THE TOP 2% HARD TO TOP 10% OF THE TOP 20% RIGHT SO- FOR YOU KNOW THAT AT LEAST IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE TRYING TO BUDGET FOR. I MEAN WE HAVE SEVEN DIFFERENT NOT A CATEGORY MANDATE MANDATORY TARGET POPULATIONS WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOME EXPECTATION ABOUT ROUGHLY HOWMANY PEOPLE ARE THESE ALL ADD UP AND HOW MANY PEOPLE IN EACH CATEGORY SO INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS SERVICE COULD BE HOMELESS. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE EXPECT MANAGED CARE PLANS REACH IS GONNA BE THE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND WE'RE EXPECTING A WHOLE STYLE THAT I AM TRYING TO READ WHAT THE L. A. O. HAS THEIR HAND UP IS YEAH MAYBE L. CAN HELP OUT WITH THAT TOO BUT. YES SIR AT LEAST FOR BUDGET IS SOME. THAT FOR I. THIS WITH MY EYES THIS BE THE- SENATE OF MEDIC HELD MINISTER BENEFIT SHOWS THAT WOULD SIR. THREE CM MINE. ARE INNER IS THAT THE ASSUMPTION IS 1% YEAH I WAS JUST GONNA SAY FROM A PURE RATE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN USING 1% THAT WAS DRIVEN BY OUR EXPERIENCE IN BOTH HEALTH HOMES AND WHOLE PERSON CARE- AND WE WILL FINE TUNE THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE- THAT'S BASED OFF OF- THOSE THAT ENGAGE. OF OR HAVE HISTORICALLY BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE SO THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW IF IT'S WHAT'S BEING BUILT INTO THE RATED IT IS CURRENTLY. PROJECTING AROUND ABOUT A 1% OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES OF FOR THE ENHANCE YOUR MANSER OKAY SO THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL TO KNOW- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO NOTE BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT ENGAGEMENT BUT ENGAGEMENT IT ALSO. SOMETIMES ENGAGEMENTS ATTEND OUTREACH. EIGHT SO YOU KNOW WHEN TO WAY STREET. AND IT'S AND IS WHERE BUILDING THE THINGS OUT AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW THE PICTURE YOU PAINTED AND THAT'S I THINK WE'D ALL LOVE TO SEE THE THING BUT- YOU KNOW THE PERSON WHO FREQUENT GOES TO THE ER. IF SOMEONE IF WE'RE NOT IF THE PLAN IS AN ENGAGING. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE OH WELL WE HAVE 1% THAT'S WHAT WE GOT PAID FOR- THEN WE'RE NOT REALLY NEEDING THE PROMISE- THAT WERE THESE PAINTINGS SO I THINK WE NEED TO SET. APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW MANY. AND THE 1% AS OF NOW AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON THE MOST HIGHEST RISK PEOPLE BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO PROVIDE THAT YOU REALLY QUE YEAH THAT'D BE GREAT AND BUT IT'S ONLY 41% AND PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT. OKAY HERE 22% WHICH WILL STILL HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS DOES MATCH THE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ELIGIBLE OUT YOU MAY NOT BE OR IF WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF DAR ELIGIBLE AND THE PERCENT OR SPRAYS- FUNDING FOR SO WE GOT NO THAT IS THAT. IS THAT 1% YOU KNOW HALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE IS THAT A THIRD IS THAT. NO EIGHTY PERCENT- SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS- AND WHETHER AND. HOW WELL RESOURCING- IN LIEU SERVICE- YOU KNOW AGAIN. AT THE- THE OF DIFFERENT THINGS HERE BUT ALSO SAYS ALLOW PLANTS INVOLUNTARY INCLUDE ONE OR MORE IN THESE SERVICES. SO- SO DOES THAT MEAN THE PLAN GETS TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO DO. WELL THE CITY HOW MANY DO WE HAVE HERE HELLO WE HAVE SEVERAL POTENTIAL ONCE BUT- SO WHAT KIND OF OVER IS SO IS IT SIMPLY THE PLAN THE SIDES OR IS THAT SOMETHING THEIR DTS NEGOTIATES WITH THE PLAN OR DO WE- WHAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT IS THERE ABOUT WHICH INCLUDES SERVICES THEY PROVIDE- IS THERE ANY EXPECTATION FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PLAN SERVES A- POPULATION WITH- THAT THAT HAS A HIGH NEED FOR. SEVERAL OF THESE LIKE FULL TIME LISTENERS HOUSING DEPOSITS HOUSING TELLS YOU THAT THEY WILL INCLUDE THAT OUR VISIT IS IT UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHICH ONES THEY WANT INCLUDING WHICH ONES THEY DON'T- AND THE THAT AFFECTS- PEOPLE'S ACCESS. TO THESE SERVICES. BUT FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT WE ARE USING TO IMPLEMENT THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES DOES REQUIRE THAT IT IS VOLUNTARY FOR THAT MANAGED CARE PLAN- TO PROVIDE THEM OR-NOT. WE HAVE A MODEL OF CARE AND TRANSITION TEMPLATE THAT'S CURRENTLY OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT NOW. GUARDS TO THE FILING TIMELINES THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD MAKE WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR WHICH IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT THEY ARE CONTINUING- WE HAVE HAD FOR EXAMPLE THAT A CROSSWALK ALL OF THE EXISTING IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ARE BEING PROVIDED WITHIN BOTH HEALTH HOMES AND WHOLE PERSON CARE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS- SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. THOSE SERVICES- ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE SERVICES OP IS IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT PROVIDERS BECAUSE THERE ARE- CLEAT THE CLEAR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO SHOULD BE PROVIDING- THOSE CERTAIN TYPES OF SERVICES AND SO- WE WILL BE ENCOURAGING ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN WHOLE PERSON CARE AND THEN EXPAND- TO THE OTHER A LITTLE SERVICES THERE ARE FOURTEEN OF THEM SO WE DON'T IMAGINE ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL- YOUR TAKE UP ALL FOURTEEN AT THE SAME TIME- BUT WE DO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE. FACING THOSE IN OVERTIME WE DO  LOT FOR THEM TO ADD A LITTLE SERVICES EVERY SIX MONTHS- AND SO WE WILL WE'LL KNOW BY THIS SUMMER- WHICH- IN LIEU OF SERVICES MANAGED CARE PLANS ANTICIPATE AT LEAST PROVIDING IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO- ARE PROPOSING TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS OUR GAPS- AND ENCOURAGE THEM- AND CONNECT THEM WITH PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT WITH THE UPCOMING PROCUREMENT- FOR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR THAT ANY MANAGED CARE PLAN I WANTED TO ENTER INTO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. WOULD BE EXPECTED TO COME IN WITH A FULL COMPOSED ALL IN REGARDS TO HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PROVIDE IN THE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. IT DEMONSTRATE THAT TO US SO SOMEONE USE THAN AND- SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT IN PROCUREMENT IS THERE PLAN SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT ALL THIS IS A TELL ME WHAT THE FOURTEENTH AND HELP THEM ALL. THE FOURTEENTH OKAY SO IS THERE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO COME OF PLAN. TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT INCORPORATE. WHY OF THEM. FOR ALL FOR. SOMETHING IN- WHAT I THINK WE WOULD SAY OTHER- NEARING LOOK INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE COMMERCIAL PLAN AND THEY HAVE A LOCAL INITIATIVE THEY SHOULD AT A MINIMUM BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT THAT LOCAL INITIATIVE IS PROVIDING EVAN LOW OF SERVICES TO HAVE- COVERAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTY. AND TELL US HOW AND WHAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES THEY WOULD BE OFFERING OF THE FOURTEEN ON THAT TO ENSURE THAT ANYONE COMING INTO OUR MARKET IS VERY COMMITTED TO- YOU KNOW BRINGING UP EVEN IF IT'S OVERTIME A PHASE IN OF THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES ON THAT WILL BE A VERY STRONG REQUIREMENT FOR US. AND THEN. RIGHT SO JUST TO CLEAR SO HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE STE SOME COUNTIES ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE PLANNED SO THAT. THE BILL HAS WHATEVER IN LIEU SERVICES STATE CHOOSE. THEN YOU HAVE TO PLANT COUNTY ZERO GMC COUNTIES- THE RURAL COUNTIES I THINK THE LEVEL THAT IT USUALLY WATER TO LEAST COUPLE PLANNED SO AND COUNTIES IN MULTIPLE PLANS. ARE WE- EXPECTING THE PLANS WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY TO AT LEAST OFFERED THE SAME SAID IN LIEU SERVICES ARE TOGETHER DIFFERENT SETS OF IN HOME SERVICES. SO WE ARE- WITHIN LIKE TO PLAN FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE- PLANTS HOWEVER UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS WE CANNOT MANDATE IT JUST TO BE CLEAR- AND SO YOU'LL BE ENCOURAGING PLANS TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE SAME LIEU OF SERVICES- I'VE FOR INDIVIDUALS- THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WE WILL ALSO BE ARE. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PLANTS IN GMC COUNTIES- THE END THAT WILL BE ROLLED OUT THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS- AND SO. WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO WORK WITH THE PLANS. HERSCHEL AND LOCAL INITIATIVES- TO ALIGN AND PROVIDE THE SAME IN LIEU OF SERVICES AND COUNTY TYPICALLY- THE BIG THING AND LEFT FOR GETTING IN LIEU OF SERVICES UP AND RUNNING IS IDENTIFYING. PROVIDERS WHO ARE I HAVE THE AILITY TO PROVIDE THOSE IN LIEU OF SERVICES- AND SO BROKERING THOSE CONVERSATIONS OF PROVIDERS ACROSS BOTH OF THE PLANS ARE TO INVEST IN THOSE SERVICES WILL BE WORKED AT THE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE IN. OKAY HI I APPRECIATE THAT THE BIGGEST BARRIER IS THE IS THE PROVIDERS BUT I I'M I'M ALSO JUST CONCERNED THAT COUNTIES WITH MULTIPLE PLANS. IF THERE IF PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT SETS OF THE NEW SERVICES- THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ITSO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO FACTOR CAPITATION RATES OR SOMETHING BECAUSE UPS BUT YOU MAY TRACK DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATIONS- AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE MEDICARE POPULATION. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS. THE SIDE WHICH PLAN LETTER TECHNIQUE THE SENATE PLAN BUT OFTEN. THEY MAY NOT MAKE A DECISION TO GET PLACE PLACE IN THE PLAN AND THEN THAT THAT YOU MAY FIND PEOPLE. AND WELL YOU HAVE A COMBINATION OF EITHER PEOPLE OR- FIND THEMSELVES. THEY'LL AUTOMATICALLY PLACED IN THE WRONG PLAN OR YOU COULD ALSO HAVE- DISTORTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT POPULATIONS AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO SAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. ACTUAR LEGAL WELL I'D WANT PROVIDE DENIMS SERVICE. BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN WANT TO ATTRACT ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE RIGHT SO WILL VOID THOSE SERVICES. AND HOPEFULLY THE OTHER PLAN WILL DO IT AND NO NO PLAN WILL DO THOSE BECAUSE THEY NEED A ONE WHAT'S THAT POPULATION IS IT'S MUCH HARDER. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IT BUT FOR EXAMPLE. I KNOW. AGAIN I UNDERSTAND YOU SAID FEDERAL REGULATION REQUIRES THAT IN LIEU SERVICES THAT THEY DO ARE VOLUNTARY- DO YOU SEE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR PAYMENT RATES FOR PLANS TO CHOOSE THE DECIDE DIFFERENTLY SERVICES WE GATHER MORE DATA ON HOW POPULATIONS. WILL BENEFIT. FROM RECEIVING CERTAIN AND LOSE SERVICES THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY. CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN CASE MIX. YES WE WOULD- THEY- PROVIDE THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT WOULD BE BUILT INTO THEIR RATE SO IF THEY- ARE PROVIDING THEM AT A HIGHER RATE OR- I'M MORE IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT IS. THAT EVENTUALLY GETS BUILT INTO THE RATE IN OUTSCORED IN THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE OF THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND HELP HOMES AS THOSE TRANSITION IN THOSE COUNTIES WE ACCOUNT FOR THOSE PLANS THAT. ELECT TO GET THOSE IN THOSE SERVICES TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS THROUGH THROUGH THE BUDGET AS WELL SO THEY WOULD BE FUNDED. WHICH WOULD BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO HAVE THAT FUNDING ALL RIGHT NOW SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DROP OFF OF THOSE IN THE WEB SERVICES IN THE COULD MAINTAIN THOSE SERVICES WITHIN THE COUNTY- SO THAT KELLY PROPOSAL COUNTER ABOUT. OKAY AND- JUST. DO I POINT OUT THAT THE- IN TERMS OF THE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY- THE AMOUNT FOR IN LIEU SERVICES UNDER LOCAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCE REQUEST. WAS HERE SAID FORTY ESSENTIALLY FORTY EIGHT MILLION- IS THAT REFLECT WHAT WAS THAT REFLECT- SO THAT IS- SIX MONTHS WORTH OF IN LIEU OF SERVICES BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY SCORING SIX MONTHS- AND THERE'S A CASH FLAG- BUT- I BELIEVE IT GETS CLOSE TO THE COURSE I DON'T HAVE MY ANNUAL NUMBERS AND BERNIE BUT LIKE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OR SO- IF I'M GOING OFF OF MEMORY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. SERVICES AND THAT'S BASED OFF OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THROUGH HEALTH COMES IN HOT PERSON CARE TODAY BASED ON UTILIZATION TODAY OKAY AND THEN FINALLY- AND- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON I KNOW THAT UNDER STAFFING RESOURCES REQUEST- I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE MEDICAID MANAGED INFORMATION SYSTEM DIVISION ONLY. HAD ONE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST- I GUESS AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA DELVE A LITTLE MORE INTO THE I. T. STUFF AND THERE'S OTHER VCTS FOR I. T. BUT I DON'T IT IN TERMS OF CALAMP WHAT HE JUST MUST BE GENERALLY IN TERMS OF I. T. L. I THINK OVERSIGHT AND DATA COLLECTION CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT WE'RE DOING THIS HUGE TRANSFORMATION WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING HOW'S IT GOING AND SO FORTH- WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE I. T. DEMANDS- FOR- FOR. GOING TO MOVING ON TO CALAIS AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DO THE KIND OF THIS ASSESSMENTS IN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEN TH OTHER PART IS THAT- I KNOW YOU'RE ADDING SOME ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL MANAGER QUALITY MONITORING DIVISION- BUT AGAIN I'D SAY WITH THIS BROADER ROLE FOR MANAGED CARE AND I THINK THAT REALLY GOING TO DO ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE THAT THE NOW THE ISSUE IS THAT I DON'T THINK WE- THE CONCERN IS THAT THE GOALS I THINK THE QUESTION IS THAT. WE CAN'T WE WHAT WE DON'T WANT HIS CONTRACT OUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTABILITY SO THEREFORE IS THAT ENOUGH STAFF TO BE SURE THERE SUFFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MANAGED. CARE PLAN DOESN'T- WELL DOESN'T DELIVER ON UNDER THINGS THAT WE COUNT ON SO- AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS HOW HOW LONG ARE THEY ON A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPENS WHAT OPTIONS DOES. THE CS ACTUALLY HAVE GIVEN THE FACT THAT MANY COUNTIES THERE ARE MANY PLANS SO THAT MEANS NOT JUST SIMPLE AS SIMPLY TURNING OFF THE PLAN- SO CAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO- THE- THE STE. THE STAFFING- SO I GUESS THE FACT I'M ACTUALLY BRING UP THE ISSUE DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH STAFF. TO BE SURE YOU DO ENOUGH OVERSIGHT THE SENATE SORRY I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR A LOT MORE STAFF. BUT I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO THE LEVEL OVERSIGHT THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPECT. FOR SUCH A LARGE TRANSFORMATION AND- YEAH. SO- ON THE- ON THE E. R. T. S. OR THE- ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY SERVICES WE DO HAVE A REQUEST FOR- SOME STAFF THERE WE DID SEPARATE OUT OUR SYSTEMS. ASK WHICH- AS YOU MENTIONED- WILL BE- COMING LATER WITH THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR SYSTEMS AND SO. ON THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING IT MAYBE NOT AS-REFLECTIVE AS STRONGLY IN THE ACTUAL CALLIE IN THE IBC PK WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WHETHER WE SHOULD- PT HIM IN. IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PIECES AND LANDED WHERE WE SEPARATED THE TO ASK BUT YOU DO SEE SOME. IN THE CALIBER I'M NOT AS MUCH AS- WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE REQUEST ON THE ON. THE ENTERPRISE SIDE- ON THE M. C. Q. AND THE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU KNOW WE DON'T CURRENTLY OTHER THAN THAT. THIS THE MINOR CREDENTIALING PIECE WE DON'T. WE DON'T DENY. ANY OF THOSE OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS TODAY SO WE HAVE. AN EXISTING STAFF DOING THAT THE REQUEST HERE IS THE ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OF ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES. ON THE ADDITIONAL- WIVES COMING INTO MANAGED CARE. AND TO TIGHTEN UP AND SHORE UP- SOME OF OUR SERVICES IN REGARDS TO. OF THAT OVERSIGHT MONITORING AND THAT SPANS OVER BOTH THE MANAGED CARE QUALITY IMAGING DIVISION AS WELL AS THE MANAGED CARE OPERATIONS DIVISION- SO JUST POINTING OUT THAT. THEY BOTH ARE ASKING FOR- YOU KNOW. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES. TO ADD TO THE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT PIECES- AND THEN WE JUST SAY WE HAVE. THE OTHER STAFF FROM OUR EXISTING KIND OF- WITHIN B. LIMITED TERM AND THE ONGOING PERMANENT REQUEST. SOME OF THOSE PERMANENT. POSITIONS IN THE OTHER BCPS ARE FORMER OVERSIGHT AND INCREASED MONITORING- WITHIN THE- FINAL RULE THE MEASURE FINAL RULE THAT CAME DOWN. IN CONVERTING THOSE TO PERMANENT REQUEST. THAT ALSO HELPS FROM AN OVERSIGHT MONITORING AND THAT IS JUST. IN A SEPARATE B. C. P. WHERE WE ARE ASKING FOR THOSE POSITIONS OKAY IF THAT HELPS OF VETERANS INSTILLED. YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW BE IT I'D- BE INTERESTED IN. HAVING SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. HOW OVERSIGHT IS GO GOING TO BE. HANDLED FOR CAL AIM AND HOW WE GET SOMETHING THAT WERE PLANTED DIFFERENTLY- ORDER SAME INTO OF OVER. AND ON THE I SIDE- THE- NOW I WON JUST BE FAIR WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD WITH SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS DON'T MAKE THE NEWS AND SO WE DO HAVE SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS IN THE STATE SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY. BECAUSE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MAKE THE NEWS SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS. BUT NOW WE ALSO HAVE HAD I. T. PROBLEMS WITH THAT LEGACY SYSTEMS ISSUES ETCETERA. SO ALSO WOULD LIKE TO- PERHAPS YOU CAN REPORT BACK ON FOR CALAMP. ARE WE LOOKING AT NEW IT SYSTEMS ARE HAVING TO UP SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE EXISTING IT SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO- TO BE SURE WE CAN COLLECT THE KIND OF DATA WE NEED BECAUSE I COLLECT A MUCH BROADER SET A DATE I ASSUME IT'S WORKING DOING THAT AND LOSE SERVICES AND THE WHOLE PERSON ETCETERA. AND THAT- WE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S ROBUST ENOUGH THAT WE CAN GET THE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS WILL HAVE. LATER IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION HOW SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION ISN'T AND OUTCOMES. SO IF WE CAN GET A REPORT BACK FROM- FROMDH CS AND OR- THE PROPIEDADES EN SEIZE. ON THAT PRIOR TO- IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. PRIOR TO A REVISED. WE'D BE HAPPY. I THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH TALK TO PAY AM CAN YOU JUST M. AND I THINK WE'RE WHAT YOU'RE FROM FROM ALL OF US IS THAT IS THE NEED A YOU KNOW THE OPTIMISM ABOUT ABOUT THE PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO THE CONCERNED ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS SOMEBODY NEW TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT WITH A STRONG pMENTAL HEALTH WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING YOU THINK WELL IT'S NOT MAYBE WE DON'T NEED MORE MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO USE IT. IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER CAN YOU TELL ME OF JUST. BRIEFLY SO IF WE'RE GONNA BE DOING ALL THIS OUT TO THE PLANS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE INTERFACE WITH THE ALL THE PROP SIXTY THREE PROGRAMS OR WILL THEY BE PART OF THE CONTRACTOR. CONTRACTING SERVICES. SO ARE WE ARE HOPING THAT OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL CONTRACT WITH. OUR COUNTY PARTNERS- IN REGARDS ESPECIALLY WHERE THERE'S CROSSOVER WITH THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND- SOME ACCOUNT PARTNERS IN THE A LITTLE SERVICES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE THERE- IT IS ONE OF OUR EXPECTATIONS OF- THE ROLLOUT AND THE HOPE THAT THE PARTNERSHIPS WILL TAKE PLACE. I THINK THAT- INTEGRATING OUR OUR SYSTEMS IS REALLY CRITICAL AND IT'S ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS THAT WE ARE HOPING THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE- WITH SOME OF THE CALAIS BY HAVING DIRECT CONTRACTS BETWEEN MANAGED CARE PLANS AND COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OKAY. AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE LOSING ANY OF THE ANY OF THIS THE THERE ARE THE WAY THE PLANS ARE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED DO WE SEE ANY CHANGES TO ANY OF THAT. IT'S REGIONAL OR OR- TO COUNTY YOUR- PUBLIC. SO THOSE CHANGES ARE PROPOSED IN AND CAL AIM- HOWEVER WITH HER UPCOMING PROCUREMENT- WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE A REQUEST FOR INTENT FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE REQUESTED TO CHANGE. THEIR MODEL- WHETHER THAT BE A TO A TO PLAN OUR CLOTHES OR- I SMALL COUNTIES THAT ARE WANTING TO JOIN EXISTING CODES FOR EXAMPLE- THOSE LETTERS OF INTENT OR DO YOU TO LAST. UP SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THAT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PROCUREMENT TO WORK ONLY PROCURING COMMERCIAL PLANS- IN COUNTIES WHERE WE NEED TO AND SO. WE WOULD NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ONCE WE HAVE INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO WHICH COUNTIES ARE CONTEMPLATING CHANGING THEIR- THEIR MODEL- DURING THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. VISIT WHERE WE WOULD JUST WANT TO BE ESPECIALLY MINDFUL OF THOSE WHO ARE. IT'S VERY HARD TO SERVE IN THE RURAL AREAS THAT WE DON'T LOSE ANY. OKAY ASSEMBLY THIS. THANK YOU RECOGNIZE ME NOW CHAIR- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS GIVEN THE SIZEABLE UP FRONT INVESTMENTS IN CALTRAIN- WHEN HIS APARTMENT WINDOWS IN DEPARTMENT EXPECT THAT WE WILL BREAK EVEN- BRUCE CAL COST REDUCTIONS. I DO NOT HAVE A PRODUCTION OF THAT AT THIS TIME. OKAY LEARN MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE THEN THAT- THE STATE AUDITOR'S PRETTY SEVERAL RECORDS DOCUMENTING THE STRUGGLES- IN THAT ACCOUNT MANAGED PLANS IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE BASIC PREVENTATIVE CARE. SO HOW CONFIDENT AND IS THE DEPARTMENTS- EIGHT IN MEDIC CAL- MANAGED CARE PLANS BEING ABLE TO TAKE ON THESE ADDED RESPONSIBILITIES GET AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY. IN JUST PROVIDING- YOU KNOW BASIC HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. SO I THINK THAT- THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS ON- HAVE BEING VERY TIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT- FOR EXAMPLE WE DO PLAN ON IMPLEMENTING VERY YOU KNOW POST GO LIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BOTH FROM OUR REGION GAUGE MEN AS WELL AS ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THE SERVICES- WE ARE ALSO THINKING THROUGH WHAT METRICS YOU WILL WANT TO EVALUATE TO CLOSELY MONITOR- THIS WORK- AND REALLY THINK ABOUT IT FROM A DELIVERY SYSTEM OF POINT OF VIEW. WE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN REGARDS TO YOU- ENSURING THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE SERVICES- AND THINKING A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY IN REGARDS TO HOW WE DO THAT WITH AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE ROLLED OUT- IN TWENTY TWENTY EVEN WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO. WORK CLOSELY WITH ALL OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS I THINK IT'S ALSO ON THE PROCUREMENT I WAS MENTIONING IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE USING- EVALUATION OF WHO COMES INTO THE MARKETING CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PROVIDINGHIGH QUALITY OF SERVICES AND QUALITY AND THINGS pSERVICES TO CHILDREN. IT'S GOING TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN REGARDS TO OUR VALUATION OF THOSE PLANS I'M. JUST TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FUTURE- OKAY SO THEN MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE HEALTH CARE- SYSTEM HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SO MANY CHANGES- WHITE IS DH CS YEAR OLD THAT- SO MANY THESE DRAMATIC CHANGES ARE NECESSARY THIS YEAR. ALSO THE DRIVING FACTOR BEHIND- THE CHANGES THIS YEAR IS THE END OF OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER SO- WE ACTUALLY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER WHICH IS CURRENTLY WHERE MANY OF THESE PILOTS ARE- FUNDED OF WHETHER THROUGH LOCAL FUNDS OR MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO END ON DECEMBER. THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WE QUICKLY SUBMITTED AN EXTENSION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR A TWELVE MONTH EXTENSION WHICH IS UNPRECEDENTED JUST TO BE CLEAR IN REGARDS TO THAT REQUEST- IT WAS GRANTED- TO CALIFORNIA TO GET ONE MORE YEAR. ON WITH OUR LIVES FIFTEEN ENDING. A IT DOES HAPPEN TO TRANSITION TO OTHER FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE- THE DELIVERIES ARE THE UP THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- AND OTHER. YOU KNOW PILOTS LIKE THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE WITHIN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN- AND SO THAT IS THE ISSUE BEFORE US IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE CALLIN PROPONENTS. OF THAT THAT ARE CURRENTLY SCORED IN THE BUDGET BOTH SIDES BELIEVE THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT LOVE SERVICES AN INCENTIVE DOLLARS AS WELL AS THE DTI TRANSITION- WE DO THINK THAT- WE ARE WHAT YOU WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE COUNTIES IN THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROVIDING. MANY OF THOSE SERVICES HAVE A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE. INTO SERVICE DELIVERY PERSPECTIVE FOR BENEFICIARIES BECAUSE- MINUS THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WOULD HAVE TO END THOSE PROGRAMS PILOTS AND FUNDING TO THOSE ENTITIES WHICH COULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE. COSMETIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU MUCH THE YOU MENTION. THANK YOU SO- BY IT I AS AS EVERYONE IS YOUR MY ME AGAIN I'M TO THEM. NEW TO THIS WE WERE STARTING THIS WE THOUGHT THIS IS ALL WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT IN TWENTY TWENTY WAS KILLING HIM. BUT INSTEAD WE ALL STOPPED STOPPED AND TALKED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. AND NOW GOING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE NEED TO REVISIT THE CONVERSATION TO BEGIN OUR TRANSITION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARTIFICE NOTHING ELSE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX. ALL RIGHT- SO I WILL TRY TO. KEEP THIS BRIEF AND THEN OPEN FOR QUESTIONS- CURRENT LAW PROVIDES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF A NUMBER OF PROP FIFTY SIX- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS- JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL BENEFITS AT THE END OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GENERALLY PROPOSES TO DELAY THE SUSPENSION DATES BY ONE YEAR- BUT I WILL KIND OF BREAK DOWN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES. I'M SO THE BUDGET PROPOSES TO AND THE- PROPERTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THE LIE OF TWENTY TWO. OR PHYSICIANS DENTAL NONEMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION- TRAUMA SCREENINGS- DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT- PIECE AS- IT PROPOSES TO AND THE PROPERTY SIX PAYMENTS DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OR AYE CFT D. FREESTANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE AND THE SEA BASS PROGRAM. THERE ARE NO PROPOSED SUSPENSIONS FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH FAMILY PLANNING. THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM OR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION INITIATIVES. THE AIDS AND HIV WAIVER AS WELL AS THE HOME HELP IN PEDIATRIC. DAY HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE DOES PROPOSE. OF AN EXTENSION OF THE POSTPARTUM ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND ALL OPTIONAL BENEFITS TO DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I WOULD JUST NOTED THAT WE PREVIOUSLY HAD INCLUDED IN SUSPENSIONS OTHER SCREENING FOR ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCES ALSO KNOWN AS S. BURKE- FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE- SENSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DEEMED IT A PART OF- OUR REGULAR SCREENING REQUIREMENTS WITHIN MEDICAID- AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION IN THE FUTURE IS NOW A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE. IN MEDICAID. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. FIRST WITH NO DEPARTMENT FINANCED. NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME HELLO PLEASE. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN A CORE ISSUE THAT WITH THE L. A. L. JUST WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AND MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT THAT OUR OFFICE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS ON OUR WEBSITE- NOT TOO LONG AGO DISCUSSING THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE ACROSS THE BUDGET MORE GENERALLY SO NOT ONLY IN MEDIC CALORIE IN DH CS- AND IN THAT ANALYSIS WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET BILL SUSPENSION LANGUAGE- WE FIND THAT MOST OF THE SUSPENSION ITEMS. FIND CORE STATE SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE TREATED AS ONGOING COSTS- AND NOT AS TEMPORARY COSTS AS AS THE SUSPENSION MECHANISM MAKES THEM- WE ALSO FIND THAT THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE CREATES UNCERTAINTY FOR PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS OF SERVICES FOR THE PROGRAMS- POTENTIALLY AFFECTED BY THE SUSPENSIONS- WHICH COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THEM SERVICE DELIVERY- JUST SORT OF WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- OUR RECOMMENDATION DOESN'T NECESSARILY PRECLUDE. I'M AN ASSESSMENT BEING DONE OF ON THE ON GOING SORT OF- ITEMS SUBJECTS THIS FUNCTION IN THE SPENDING IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM- BUT WE VIEW THAT DECISION AS SORT OF A SEPARATE- PROCESS FROM YOU KNOW THE ACT OF MAKING PROGRAM SUBJECT TO SUSPENSION WHICH- SORT OF CONVEYS UNCERTAINTY IN NON COULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF TEMPORARY COSTS THAT. ARE ESSENTIALLY ON- DIDN'T DESERVE FAR MORE INTEREST FOR DOC. S. YOU QUESTIONED. AB NO THE DEPARTMENT HAVE RESPONSE THANK YOU DOCTOR. THANK AND I JUST WANT TO THE WIND. MY WITH WHAT THE L. A. S. R. DO IS. IN THIS. WE HAVE THIS VERY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. WHERE WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE ADMINISTRATION- PAYING A SOARED OVER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BY BUILDING IN CUTS AND THEN SAYING WELL WE'LL SUSPEND- ARE WE WILL MAKE THEM THIS YEAR BUT WILL LEAVE THEM AND SO WE HAVE THESE CUTS THEY'RE BASICALLY. HANGING OUT THERE SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS CHOSEN TO THE LADY THE SUSPENSIONS BUT WE SHOULD HAVE THE SUSPENSIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHEN WE HAVE THAT BUDGET YEAR OF IT TURNS OUT WE NEED TO MAKE CUTS WE SHOULD DELIBERATE ON. WHAT WE NEED TO DO HOW BIG IT CETERA INSTEAD OF PUTTING AUTOMATIC CUTS ESSENTIALLY BUILDING IT IN TO THE HEALTH ESPECIALLY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET I MEAN IT SEEMS TO BE PRIMARILY THAT'S WHERE THEY ALL ARE SO HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PROPERTY SIX A MEDIC CAL WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES LATER WE TALK ABOUT THAT SOCIAL SERVICES. AND IT DOES CREATE YOU KNOW IT THAT DOES CREATE THIS UNCERTAINTY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOW PARTICIPATION RATES OF PROVIDERS AND MEDIKAL PROPERTY SIX WAS ACTUALLY FUNDING TO TRY TO GET MORE FIGHTERS TO ACCEPT MEDICARE NOW ITHINK WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT THAT BUT THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT FOR IF YOU'RE A PROVIDER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS LOOMING CUTS OVER YOU AND THEN I GUESS GRANT ISSUE THAT WE WERE NOT GONNA MAKE THE CUT THIS YEAR IS NOT REALLY THE WAY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS SO I JUST WANT TO HAVE TO SAY THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE L. A. L. ALSO CHANGE SEEM CONCERNED SO I DO SUPPORT CERTAINLY WHAT'S BEFORE US WE DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO. TO HAVE THE DELAYED THE SUSPENSIONS BUT WE SHOULD HAVE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IN MY OPINION THANK YOU. THINK YOU'RE MEANT CENTER MELINDA'S- I THINK UNANIMOUS. ONLINE SPEAKING BEHALF OF MY CAN- MARICAO. ALL CAL. WHO ARE. I DON'T WANT CRAZINESS. FOR ME TO COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES BUT I SUSPECT. THEY MAY SHARE MY SENTIMENTS THAT- THESE ARE VERY COOL TAX. HIKES FLATLY. REJECTED THEM AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH OR EVEN AFTER THE MAIN RESIGNS TO REJECT THESE CALL THESE KINDS I THINK THEY SHOULD BE REJECTED NOW SO. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO REJECT- THESE CUTS IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND INSTEAD- I DOCTOR ARE PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THESE CUTS AND FUTURE. BYE APPRECIATE YOUR MOTION- I THINK JUST TECHNICALLY WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE DISCUSSION ON IT.

THANK YOU MANAGER RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK I JUST START BY UNITED KNOWLEDGE IN THE COMMENTS OFFERED BY SENATORS AND MELENDEZ- YEAH I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE CRITIQUES THE MAIN THING I WOULD JUST POINT OUT AS YOU KNOW OUR OUR OFFICE IS PROJECTING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FUTURE DEFICITS YOU KNOW FROM A STRUCTURAL PERSPECTIVE- BY IN LARGE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS. IS PROPOSING LARGELY ONE TIME SPENDING THAT IS NOW- YOU KNOW- I THINK REFLECTING THE NATURE OF THE BUDGET CONDITION- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WOULD WALK AWAY FROM THE SUSPENSIONS PACKAGE BUT ONLY MAKE WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FUTURE PROBLEM EVEN WORSE- SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE IT'S AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING I WOULD JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT WOULD NOT BE AN ACTION THAT WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE.

I AM GOING TO SEE IF WENDY HARRINGTON HAS THAT ANSWER. I DO NOT HAVE A READILY AVAILABLE BUT WE CAN'T WE CAN'T PROVIDE THAT. AND I FOLLOW UP ALL RIGHT AND IF THEN IF THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE FOR PERHAPS A HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT DO WE SEE THE END OF A TRANSITION FROM. THE MODELS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED WITH WITH CONTRACTING WITH PRIVATE DID TO MOVING BACK MORE TOWARDS A PUBLIC MODEL WOULD BE MY QUESTION AROUND THAT. DR GRANT. THE TERM LENDERS. I YES MANAGER THANK YOU I'M NOT REALLY INTO THIS ISSUE I DIDN'T GET MY HAND RAISE ANTITRUST SORRY WHEN I GO BACK TO THE MOTION THAT I NEED- BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM THEN WE CAN TAKE ABOUT. I DO I DO NOT BELIEVE WE CAN TAKE A VOTE IN A INFORMATIONAL HEARING- JUST BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE NOTICED. MMHM I WONDER IF THERE'S A- AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST. DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE IF IT'S POSSIBLE CERTAINLY I THINK SHE MIGHT NOT WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT IF WE CAN'T OKAY AND I THINK WE HAVE OUR EXPERT HERE. A PARLIAMENTARIAN I GUESS WE SHOULD INSTEAD OF EXPERTS. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE TAKE A VOTE ON AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND I GUESS ALSO WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISHED JUST A PERCEPTION PURPOSES- SO THE QUESTION IS A SYMBOL AND HAS MADE THE MOTION FOR TO TAKE A VOTE NOW WE SAID WE CANNOT BECAUSE AN INFORMATIONAL AND SHE ASKED IF WE COULD PLEASE VERIFY THAT. WE'RE IN A FACT FINDING. HEARING AT THIS TIME. THERE'S NO BILL ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF RECORDS- WITH THE ANSWER. MEDICOS THANK YOU. DIGITAL DID YOU WANT TO GO TO THE- YEAH YEAH OKAY. EXHIBITOR MANAGER MEMBERS WERE IN A FACT FINDING HEARING RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO BILL BEFORE US THERE'S NOTHING TO VOTE ON RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO QUORUM OF THE SENATE.

ENTERTAIN MOTIONS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THANK YOU CENTER MODEST- HUESO I THINK IT'S THE KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT PRACTICING IN BUT THAT WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY BECAUSE IF WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM WHICH I REALIZE WE HAVEN'T DONE YET THIS COMMUNE OR WE COULD DO THAT AND A LOT OF. POTENTIAL POTENTIALLY WE COULD I THINK IF THE SENATE WERE IN SESSION BUT WE ARE BUT WE ARE NOT BUT NOT IN YOUR COMMITTEE RIGHT AND IN THIS COMMITTEE WERE NOT ACTUALLY IN SESSION BECAUSE IT'S AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING VERSUS A. A REGULAR BILL HEARING. IT YOU WERE IN A BILL HERE IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. BUT WELL BUDGET HEARING IT'S I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ENGENDERS TO VOTE ON BUT I. WASN'T MY IMPRESSION THAT THIS WAS SIMPLY LOOK PROFESSIONAL HERE. YES MA'AM IT IS IT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. OKAY THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS THE SENTIMENT IS HONEST. NOW MANAGER THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT MOVING ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT TELEHEALTH. SORRY. ALL RIGHT TELEHEALTH SO I'D THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GREATLY EXPANDED OUR TELEHEALTH POLICY I'M AND- IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WAS BEFORE US IN IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE EXPANDED SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITIES AROUND THE TELEHEALTH- IN ADDITION TO THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAD PUT PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND SAW AND EXTENSIVE UPTAKE AND UTILIZATION OF THAT TELEHEALTH DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ON SOME OF THE TEMPORARY POLICIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF BLACK STUDIES PUT IN PLACE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE EXPANDING THE ABILITY FOR PROVIDERS TO RENDER ALL APPLICABLE MEDICAL SERVICES- VIA TELEHEALTH WHEN APPROPRIATE- INCLUDING- THE HISTORICAL ADD PIECES BEING PROVIDED AND IN OUR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES- OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ARE ELEAZAR. AS WELL AS TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT HAD PREVIOUSLY NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE TELEHEALTH WE EXPANDED THE CENTURY A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH ACROSS OUR ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM WE ALSO ALLOWED FOR TELEHEALTH MODALITIES TO BE PROVIDED- FOR NEW AND ESTABLISHED PATIENTS ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE WE ALLOWED FOR COVERED SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED VIA TELEHEALTH AND AUDIO ONLY SERVICES FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAD HISTORICALLY IN MOST DELIVERY SYSTEMS UP ALLOWED FOR A PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED PAYMENT PARITY BETWEEN SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED FACE TO FACE A SYNCHRONOUS AND TELEPHONIC AUDIO- ONLY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THAT INCLUDED FOR A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND RURAL HEALTH CENTERS. IN BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE WE ALSO WAY TO SITE LIMITATIONS FOR BOTH PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS- FOR FQHCS. WHICH ALLOWS THE PER BY INDOOR THE BENEFITS YOU TO BE AN LOCATION OUTSIDE OF CLINIC RENDER AN OR RECEIVE SERVICE. I'M IN LOVE EMPLOYMENT. ALL FEDERAL FLEXIBILITIES INCLUDING OF FLEXIBILITIES FOR GOOD FAITH EXEMPTION GRANTED BY THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS ALLOWING FOR VARIOUS- HIT BUT REQUIREMENTS COLLECTIBILITY. YOU KNOW MUCH ABOUT LED TO YOU- AT A GREAT EXPANSION DH YES HAS BEEN WORKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME TO PUT FOR THE TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL THAT WE- MADE PUBLIC AT THE BEGINNING OF FEBRUARY. OR WHAT WE PROPOSED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WHAT I WOULD- NO TAKE HERE IS THAT WHILE. THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO ADD ENDED NOW IT DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL WE ARE PROPOSING IT START IN JULY- PROVIDERS AND MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD STILL HAVE ALL A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FLEXIBILITIES. THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WHAT IT ALLOWS US TO DO IS GET ALL FEDERAL APPROVALS BEFORE THE END OF THAT TIME PERIOD SO THAT PROVIDERS AND PLANTS ARE VERY AWARE. OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING THAT WE CONTINUE AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE IN PLACE AND SO THAT'S AT THE TINY. THERE BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE PUT FORWARD IS VERY REASONABLE AND BALANCED IN TERMS OF PROMOTING- APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF CARE- WHILE PROVIDING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND HELPING TO ADVANCE EQUITY- ACROSS THE VARIOUS MODALITIES IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM- BUT WE ALSO IT. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A BENEFICIARY CHOICE- AND PRESERVE OUR PROVIDER FLEXIBILITY WHILE STILL PROTECTING AS YOU KNOW FROM APPROPRIATE PROGRAM INTEGRITY POINT OF VIEW OF. A BOTH FROM. A QUALITY AND A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. I SO- WE TO A NUMBER OF GUYS PRINCIPLE AS WE CAN- UP WITH OUR AYE PROPOSAL NEW FORD. INCLUDING EQUITY ACCESS STANDARD OF CARE PATIENT CHOICE. CONFIDENTIALITY STEWARDSHIP AND PAYMENT APPROPRIATENESS- AND I WALK THROUGH WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING- THE MOVE FORWARD- IN OUR TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL- AFFECTED YOUR JULY ONE OF TWENTY ONE- AS REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY. ALSO WE ARE PROPOSING TO ALLOW SPECIFIC FQHC AND RURAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A NEW PATIENTS. LOCATED WITHIN ITS FEDERALLY DESIGNATED SERVICE AREA THROUGH SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. SOMETHING THEY PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO- MAKE PERMANENT THE REMOVAL OF THE SITE LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY FOR FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. OF FOR EXAMPLE IS MENTIONED. ALONG THE BENEFITS YOU'RE A PROVIDER TO BE. OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE OR WITHIN THEIR. HOME TO RECEIVE SUCH SERVICES. POSED TO X. THANK AND EAST AS TELEHEALTH. IN OUR NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEE WAIVERS ARE WHAT SOME PEOPLE KNOW IS HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IN OUR TARGET CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND WITHIN THE L. E. A. BACH OR BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. WE ARE PROPOSING TO ADD SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH AND TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY SERVICES TO THE STATE PLAN DRUG MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO REQUIRE PAYMENT PARITY FOR IN PERSON FACE TO FACE VISITS AND SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES ONLY- THIS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE FOR ACCURACY AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS IN REGARDS TO THAT PAYMENT PARITY- HOWEVER WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THERE WOULD BE. SUBJECT TO A SEPARATE FEE SCHEDULE FOR- ASYNCHRONOUS VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION AND TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY- SERVICES WITHIN THE PROPOSAL- I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT HERE- THAT THAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD NOT ALLOW AT UACS OVERALL HEALTH CLINICS THE BILL FOR TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY SERVICES IN OUR PROPOSAL. WE ARE ALSO- RECOMMENDING THAT THE- TCM AND ELIA BOB WOULD CONTINUE TO BE REIMBURSED AT A- CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURE OR COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT SO THERE'S BE SCHEDULE WOULD BE DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE FROM WHAT WAS JUST RECOMMENDED- SO AGAIN TO JUST- INDICATE THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT RECOMMENDING THE CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN FLEXIBILITIES INCLUDING- TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES AS A BILLABLE VISIT FOR FQHCS VERALL HEALTH CLINICS AT THE PPS RATE. WHEN WE CONSULTED WITH- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I SENSE IT IF A PHYSICIAN OR A BILLABLE PROVIDER UNDER AN ACT YOU EACH THE- BILLS FOR SERVICES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE PPS RATE AND SINCE WE ARE PROPOSING TO NOT PAY TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY SERVICES- AT. THE SAME RATE ARE AT PARITY WITH A FACE TO FACE BUT BASED ON A DEATH A DIFFERENT FEE SCHEDULE IS WHY WE ARE NOT MOVING FORWARD THAT RECOMMENDATION HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT WE WOULD I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN- THE FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PARTICIPATING IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT WE WOULD ALLOW IN THE APM MODEL- FQHCS TO DO TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY ALLOWABLE A VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION- WITHIN THAT EIGHT PM. WE ALSO- ARE NOT RIGHT. THAT THE TELE AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES CAN BE USED TO ESTABLISH A NEW PATIENT- WE FEEL LIKE IT'S ONLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USED ONCE- THAT RELATIONSHIP PROVIDER RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THAT'S ACROSS. ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR THAT PROPOSAL- AND THEN AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY NOT RECOMMENDING PAYMENT PARITY FOR AUDIO ONLY VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS- WITHIN THIS A PROPOSAL. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR. MAKING ANY CHANGES FOR TRIBAL SIX THIRTY EIGHT CLINICS IN REGARDS TO TELEHEALTH PROVISIONS. AND I WOULD DEFER TO THEM HOWEVER IF A TRIBAL- AREA MOVES TO THE TRIBAL FQHCS THEY WOULD THEN ADOPT ANY OF OUR PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR FQHC RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. I'M THERE IS A TABLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL THAT HELPS BREAK THIS DOWN IN REGARDS TO PRE- THE CODED A NINETEEN AND THEN PROPOSED CODE NINETEEN OF PROPOSALS ARE BECAUSE OUR- DELIVERY SYSTEM IS COMPLEX. IF WE DO BREAK IT DOWN BY THE DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS OF WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING AS A CHEAT SHEET FOR INDIVIDUALS- WE ALSO WOULD HAVE TO IMPLEMENT A NUMBER OF OTHER ACTIONS TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN INCLUDING- AT TRAILER BILL- BEFORE AT PEOPLE FOR REVIEW. ON STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS. WEBER CHANGES- REGULATION CHANGES AS WELL AS WORKING VERY CLOSELY TO DEVELOP KIND OF BERRIES POLICY GUIDANCE IN REGARD TO HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN MEDIC HOW- SO I WILL. ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING- TO ADAM REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING- WITHIN THE- THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE DID NOT PROVIDE FOR A REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BOB AFTER REVIEWING- COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS OUR ADOBE SYSTEMS WE FELT LIKE IT WAS ON THE CRITICAL OF BENEFIT TO PUT FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION- WE ARE REQUESTING NINETY FIVE MILLION TOTAL FUNDER THIRTY FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND- OUT AS A PART OF THE PROPOSAL. WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO COVER REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING- SO I WILL PAUSE THERE AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOTHING AT THIS TIME THANK YOU LMAO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE TS IS DOING TO TRY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH AND ALSO INCLUDING- REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING I THINK THAT- PARTICULARLY FOR COMMUNITIES WHERE- THEY HAVE MORE FOR ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE AND OTHER THINGS IS. THAT I THINK THIS WILL BE HELPFUL I GUESS THE- MARTIN AND I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT AUDIO I GUESS MY CONCERN. ABOUT SOME OF THE- NOT SENDING SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES AROUND AUDIO ONLY A TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY IS THAT- WE'RE GONNA CAL'S A LOWER INCOME LOWER RESOURCE POPULATION- SO USUALLY LESS ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED LIKE WIFI AND OTHER THINGS- THAT'S WHAT WIFI THEY MAY HAVE OR ACCESS IS OFTEN LESS STABLE- DALY HAVE DATA CAPS AND OTHER THINGS. SO- SO I THINK THERE'S A BIT OF THE OF THE- I MEAN THEY'LL TELL GOES BOTH WAYS RIGHT SO KNOW WE CAN HAVE THE- SET UP IN THE CLINIC BUT IF THE PERSON AT THE OTHER END- DOESN'T HAVE STABLE BROADBAND THEY MAY NOT WHY ARE DAY AND DATE WITH DATA CAPS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAB WISHES CONSISTENT VIDEO CONNECTION WIRELESS WE MAY BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A- AUDIO CONNECTION RIGHT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE. THEY MAY NOT WANT TO USE VIDEO AND THEN I THINK FOR CERTAIN SENT SENSITIVE SERVICES- THAT- YES- SOMEONE MAY NOT ACTUALLY WHAT THE VIDEO ONLINE- THE NAY WITH THEY MAY BE TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN A CROWDED HOUSEHOLD ORDER TRYING TO GET TO FIND SOME PRIVATE SPACE. ARE STEPPING OUTSIDE OR SOMEWHERE WHERE AGAIN BROADBAND THAT IS GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN YEAH THIS IS BAD ENOUGH TO START. WITH SO- SO I GUESS I URGE THAT- WE'D LOOK VERY CARE. AT WHAT WE DOING AND HEALTH. ARE TERM OF PAIN- YOU KNOW- AND BECAUSE I THINK DOES IT DIFFICULTY BECOMING ACCESS ISSUE- WE ALSO THE ONE SCOURGE PROVIDERS FROM SINCE BASICALLY WINDING GAUGE BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE WELL I'M GONNA GET PAID A LOT LESS BUT THIS WAS WAY WHEN I CALL A LAWYER IS A LAWYER TAKES. STILL GIVING THE SAME HOURLY RATE- YOUR A SKILL PERSON SKILLS THE HEALTH. AT THE OTHER THAT IS THE IT IS OUR PAIN SO- SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE REST BEING PUT FOR THIS PROPOSAL- BUT- I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT. THE POPULATION THAT WERE TRYING TO SERVE AND THEIR ACCESS AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR AND OF THE TLE HEALTH- CONNECTION AND THAT AND BY LIMITING TELEPHONIC AUDIO. IN TERMS OF PAYMENT WHAT KIND OF THE- HOW WE MIGHT ACTUALLY DECREASE ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF SERVICE FOR THE MEDICARE POPULATION. AND JUST TO ECHO I MEAN. WE KNOW THAT THE- THAT pACCESS TO SOME TYPES OF CARE SPECIALTY CARE ARE OFTEN THOSE SAME REGIONS WHO HAVE THE LEAST TALK ACCESS TO BROADBAND IN SUPPORT AND THAT KIND OF HUESO. I THINK THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT GOING FORWARD. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER NINE. ALL RIGHT- SO THE BUDGET DOES PROPOSE EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FUND FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND TO ADD CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING- AS A COVERED BENEFIT- FOR BENEFICIARIES AGE TWENTY ONE OR OLDER- CGM'S ARE CURRENTLY COVERED FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. IN MEDIC HOW- TODAY- THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO ENTERING INTO REBATE AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS MANUFACTURERS REGARDING THE- CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEMS AND SUPPLIES- IN THE REBATES WILL OFFSET A GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR THAT EDITION. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO REINSTATE THE OVER THE COUNTER ADULT COUGH AND COLD PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THIS DOES RESULT IN SAVINGS- THAT. DID EXPAND- THIS OVER THE COUNTER DRUG DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH IS CURRENTLY REFLECTED IN OUR BUDGET WE ARE PROPOSING TO MAKE THAT A PERMANENT CHANGE. FOR MANY YEARS MEDICARE PROGRAM CUT BIRD OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS- AS AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS- THOSE CHANGES WERE MADE THAT QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO IN REGARDS TO THAT NOT BEING A BENEFIT IN MEDIC CAL. HOWEVER MANY OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE STILL CHOSEN TO COVER THAT AND WE ARE ESSENTIALLY PROPOSING TO ALSO WITHIN THE FULL MEDICAL PROGRAM OFFICIALLY GO BACK TO REINSTATING OVER THE COUNTER- ADULT A COUGH AND COLD PRODUCTS- SO I WILL STOP. THERE AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. DEPARTMENT FOR ANY. HELLO OKAY BUT THE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT GOING BECAUSE COVER THAT GLUCOSE MONITOR- IS A PEDIATRICIAN COURSE A LOT OF AND TO TAKE YOUR MEDICARE ALLOWED THE COVERAGE FOR A RETURN AND SEE MEDICINE COSCO PRODUCTS THESE HELPFUL I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT COUGH AND COLD PRODUCTS IS PRETTY BROAD CATEGORY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT EVIDENCE BASED COUGH AND COLD PRODUCTS. I WOULD ASSUME SO BUT I DO NOT KNOW THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT. WE'VE BEEN COVERING DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES I MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU OKAY SO YEAH MAYBE SOMEONE CAN GET GET BACK ON THE C. C. TO MEDICINES EVIDENCE BASED. SEVEN DAYS NOW- CERTAIN. BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER CONSTANT MEDICATIONS WHICH- MAY NOT BE. MADE CONTAIN EVAN BASED- AND SO I SAW WHAT THE PRESS OF THE- THANK FOR MAKING GET SOMEONE TO GET BACK ME THANK. HOPING NOT TO ABOUT THE- OKAY. IF NOTHING FURTHER WILL MOVE ON TO A NUMBER TWO. ALL RIGHT. SO TWO FOUR- THAT HAS CURRENT NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BY THE AS A OF AN TO THE FOR MONEY FALLS THE PERSON DEMONSTRATE. ON THE RECENT A MODIFY THEIR L. CRITERIA THROUGH THE U. S. SHE'S UP.

A MAXIMIZING THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE TRANSITIONS THE STATE ONLY CCT PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED GENERAL BENEFICIARIES THROUGH JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- IN WITHIN TEAM TO PROVIDE TRANSITION PAYMENTS- THROUGH JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- AND WE ARE.

I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AND WE EXPECT COST SAVINGS FROM THE SO DO WE PLAN TO. TO MAKE THIS GO OUT EVEN FURTHER. SO THE THAT WAS SCORED IN THE PREVIOUS THIS SPECIFIC REQUEST HAS TO DO WITH THE POSITIONS- AND WE DO SCORE THE VARIOUS SAVINGS I WOULD ALSO- HIGHLIGHT THAT- SOME OF THE C. C. T. SERVICES ARE PROPOSED AS IN LIEU OF SERVICES- IN THE CALLIN PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THOSE. ON EVEN BEYOND THE CURRENT A PROPOSED DATE IN. SB TWO FOURTEEN OF ENDING JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND IF FOR IN THE FUTURE I'M MONEY FALLS PERSON IS NOT FUNDED THAT WOULD ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE AND YES WE SEE ARE. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS WITH THESE TYPES OF TRANSITIONS. THANK YOU A DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. I HEAR NOTHING OKAY LMAO.

WELCOME TWO GRADES THEM INTO A- BASICALLY ENTERPRISE SYSTEM THAT'S THE HAS BEEN TO AND BASS. LET ME STOP AND IF WEST. ANYTHING FROM THE PART OF ON THIS. LMAO. RIGHT MR L. A. L. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSAL BUT ALSO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION YOU WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES TO I. T. PROJECT PROCESS SEES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING FOR THIS EFFORT- THE NEW MES MODERNIZATION PROJECT PORTFOLIO WILL BE UNLIKE ALMOST ANY OTHER I. T. PROJECT IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF ITS BREATH COMPLEXITY- ANY ADMINISTRATION LIKELY WILL NEED TO MODIFY ITS TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO PLANNING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR BOTH PROJECTS WITHIN THE EFFORT AS WELL AS OVERSIGHT OF THE WHOLE PORTFOLIO. AND WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT INFORMATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESSBUDGET REQUESTS IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER THAT INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE ENTIRE EFFORT AND LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THE WHOLE EFFORT WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO AS AN EXAMPLE IDENTIFY WHEN COMPLEX AND COSTLY PROJECTS WITHIN THE PORTFOLIOARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN AND WHAT IMPACT THEIR FAILURE COULD HAVE ON THE EFFORT AS A WHOLE. AND SO TO IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE EFFORT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE REGULARLY INFORMED OF KEY CHANGES TO EXISTING I. T. PROJECT PROCESS SEES THAT HE ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING AS WELL AS A TOP SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT BACK ON CHANGES MADE TO EXISTING I. T. PROJECT PROCESS SEES FOR THIS EFFORT SENSUALLY LOOKING A NEW OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND CONSIDERING POTENTIAL OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO CURRENT OVERSIGHT PROCESSES FOR IN PARTICULAR THOSE COMPLEX AND. COSTLY IT PROJECTS THANK YOU. THE YOU VERY MUCH- YES AND I THAN AND THAT WELL I'M NEW TO THE HEALTH THAT. POLICY AREA I AM CERTAINLY NOT NEW TO THE PROBLEMS WITH A LOT OF OUR IT PROJECTS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN. I'M AND SO WELL THE WELL THE FRENCH DEFENSE WANT TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE MODEL I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO LOOK AT THAT THOSE COMPONENTS SO THAT WE CAN MORE CAREFULLY EVALUATE. AS MR METZGER SAID- AND WE KNOW WE'RE BIG COMPLEX STATE WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT WYOMING WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND SO IT'S IT IS A- RICH WITH COMPLEXITIES- BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER. SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO OVERSIGHT ON IF WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY YOU KNOW I CAN I CAN TO SEE US BACK HERE NEXT YEAR AND ASKING. WHICH ONE WENT BAD YOU I WILL NOT SURE BECAUSE IT'S ALL COMBINED BECAUSE THE FED REQUIRE US TO DO IT ALL TOGETHER. SO WELL THE FEDS WILL ORGAN REQUIRED THAT WAY. I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO WANT TO SEE THE DISCRETE ISSUES TO WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG WE CAN MORE CAREFULLY FINE TUNE IT. THEN TRYING TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE SYSTEM OR JUST SAYING IT'S TOO BIG AND WE CAN'T WE CAN'T MANAGE IT. DR THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND ANOTHER WITH CODE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THINGS BUT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THE PASSES FOR EXAMPLE- BIGGEST QUESTION. IS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD. THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACOLOGY ACTUALLY ALSO BE PRESENT AT THE HEARING WE TALK ABOUT IT PROJECTS SO THAT WE CAN GUESS. ASK THEM QUESTIONS AS WELL. SO% I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR DTS IS THAT- TO WHAT DEGREE IS- DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY BEING INVOLVED IN YOUR PROCUREMENTS AND YOUR VALUATION OF THE- THIS I. T. EFFORT TO TIE INTO GREAT. CELL SIZE IMAGE KIND OF ALL SOFTWARE- THAT CONTRACTS FIRST. UPGRADE ARE. ARE NEW SOFTWARE AND ALSO- ALSO- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO ENGAGE I MEAN ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTFAILURES OF IT SYSTEMS IS NOT ENGAGING THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THE SYSTEM NOT JUST THE IT EXPERTS BUT THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE THE SYSTEM- THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED AS WELL SO TO DEAL WITH INTERFACES USE AND SO FORTH SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. AND IS ACTUALLY AND KALECKI ACTUALLY DOES HAVE A SEQUENCE OF SERIES OF THINGS THEY THEY DO TO EVALUATE SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO HOW HOW HE'S BEEN INVOLVED AND- AT WHAT- WHAT STAGE ARE YOU AT AND- IN TERMS OF THEIR- AND IN TERMS OF- THIS THIS PROCESS. YEAH I MEAN WE ARE. COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY ROBUST OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WELL WE HAVE ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. AND WE DO NOT QUARTERLY PROJECT STATUS UPDATES TO LEGISLATIVE STOPPED. THE L. A. O. THEY GREW STATE AUDITOR. OKAY I UNDERSTAND IS THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY ACTUALLY AVAILABLE.

PLAN IS TO HAVE A IN WOULD MY OF THE PROJECT- BASICALLY LOOK AT THE IF THAT WITH- SYSTEMS HE- WHAT HE SAYS YEAH THE MARTIN BUST FROM MAKE SOME SYSTEMS CAN MY- AND DO IN A MODEL AT. BASED ON LIKE I BASEMENT OF MAY MODEL OKAY. BUT THAT SO THAT THE FOR OUR OVERSIGHT PURPOSES THAT WE CAN SERVE SEE WHAT'S THE ROADMAP. THAT WERE- EMBARKING ON IN TERMS OF OUR I. T.

DR GRANT GIVING HONEST OKAY THANK YOU AB MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. OR SO I'M GONNA GIVE A AN OVERVIEW AND THEN. GOING QUESTIONS SO- MEDICAL BREAKING INTO A VARIETY OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEMS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IN COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PIECES SO WE HAVE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH CARE- WHICH IS SERVICES PROVIDED. TO PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THIS IS CARVED OUT OF OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCING AND MANAGING THE BET BENEFIT WAS RELYING TO COUNTIES IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. I COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FULL DELIVERY OF THESE SERVICES THAT ARE CARVED OUT THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE END OF THEIR REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW TO FOLLOW ALL MANAGED CARE RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDING THINGS LIKE TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS NETWORK ADEQUACY GRIEVANCES ETCETERA. FOR THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES- OF FOR SERVICES- THAT ARE ADULTS AS OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS RESPONSIBLE FOR MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES- IT FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NON. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN COMES TO USE USE DISORDERS. WITHIN OUR PROGRAM- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT IS DONNELLY CARVED OUT OF THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTIES. THROUGH REALIGNMENT OF COURSE WE HAVE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN ALL COUNTIES ARE THIS IS CALLED DRUG MEDI CAL. WHICH INCLUDES OUTPATIENT TREATMENT NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN WOMEN. I WE HAVE AN EXPANDED SUITE OF SERVICES AVAILABLE IN COUNTIES THAT HAVE OPTED IN TO THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM. INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL CARE OF FOR ALL BENEFICIARIES MEETING MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA- AND THEN WE JUST KNOW THERE ARE A FEW SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES IN MANAGED CARE PLANS. MOST NOTABLY THE SCREENING BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS AS WELL AS PRESCRIBING IN MANAGING- MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USED DISORDER- IS WELL IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AFTER WHAT'S KNOWN AS AND I JUST SAY I PASSED BY CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. I FUNDED BY 1% INCOME TAX ON PERSONAL INCOME IN EXCESS OF ONE MILLION- PER YEAR. IT IS DESIGNED TO EXPAND IN TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH AND AT RISK OF SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THEIR FAMILIES. ADDRESSES A BROAD CONTINUUM OF BOTH PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND SERVICES NEEDED AS WELL AS- THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING ELEMENTS TO EXPAND THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. SENSE PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR EIGHT GENERATES APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS- FURTHER ON OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES FEDERAL GRANTS ARE. GRANTS FROM SAM SAT ON THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION- WE HAVE RECEIVED AS- A BLOCK GRANT FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES TO PROVIDE PREVENTION TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE ALSO HAVE RECEIVED A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH BLOCK GRANTS ARE FOR THE FISCAL YEARS OF TWENTY TWENTY- INCLUDING NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THOSE FUNDS. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST A WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE'S OPIOID RESPONSES SO SANTA PROVIDES GRANT FUNDS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR THE STATEWIDE OPIOID RESPONSE A CURRENT PROJECT PERIOD- RUNS THROUGH SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. BUT THE TOTAL PROJECT AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. THESE FUNDS ARE USED TO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF MEDICAID AS MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT IN MULTIPLE SETTINGS ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE SEEN GREAT- INCREASES IN THE USE OF THESE FUNDS SO I WILL PAUSE THERE AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. HELLO. IT THIRTY COOPER. WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS THROUGH THE CALENDAR PROGRAM HOW WILL THIS CHANGE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A QUITE EXTENSIVE PROPOSALS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPACE WITHIN CAL AIMS- THE FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH CHANGES TO THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA THAT WE USE FOR- THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS WHERE WE ARE PROPOSING- TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT OF SERVICES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS- TO ALLOW THE RELATIONSHIP AND TREATMENT TO BEGIN WITH THE- PROVIDER AND BENEFICIARY. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE DETERMINING THAT DIAGNOSIS WE ALSO MADE MODIFICATION IN REGARDS TO SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE MAXIMUM ACCESS TO ALL AND A NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND SO THAT'S ONE PIECE- ADDITIONALLY WE ARE PROPOSING OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORM- CURRENTLY WE PAY OUR COUNTIES ON A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT- WE ARE PROPOSING IN CALAIS TO MOVE TO A FEE SCHEDULE. WHICH WOULD ALLOW US SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BASED ON THAT FEE SCHEDULE AND THEN IT WOULD ALLOW FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY IF THEY WERE TO CONTRACT WITH THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLAN TO PROVIDE MAYBE ENHANCE YOUR MANAGEMENT OR LIEU OF SERVICES THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THE REVENUE UP FROM THOSE SERVICES. AND REINVEST THEM INTO THE DELIVERY SYSTEM I WHERE IS TODAY WITH THE COST BASE WE RECONCILE- AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO AN OPPORTUNITY THERE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO INCREASE THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS SERVICES. WE ALSO ARE PROPOSING- IT DO YOU DO YOU BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION AND BY THAT WE MEAN- BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WHERE WE HAVE OF THE MANAGED CARE ENTITIES THEY ARE SEPARATELY- FOLLOWING SEPARATE CONTRACTS- WE HAVE SEPARATE REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS TO OVERSIGHT PIECES. IN BY COMBINING THOSE INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE ENTITIES- THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REDUCE A LARGE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BOTH AT THE STATE AT THE COUNTY AND THE PROVIDER LEVEL- IT ALLOWS FOR MORE STREAMLINED OVERSIGHT MONITORING OF. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ENTITIES I WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR ROAD OF HOW CAN GET TO YOU A BIT. AND FOR MANY HEALTH AND SO USE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WOULDN'T REQUIRE THAT AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL THEY BE INTEGRATED BUT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR IT I WHICH WE THINK IS A BENEFIT- ON THAT PERSPECTIVE- WE ALSO HAVE PUT FORWARD. A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS WITHIN OUR DRUG- R. D. N. CO DS OR ARE A DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM- TO JUST IMPROVE THAT PILOT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN MOVES THINGS FORWARD SO THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE- PROPOSAL WITHIN CALLAHAN TO REALLY MOVE. ON INCREASE ACCESS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF SERVICES ON THE BEHAVIOR OUTSIDE. BUT TOCONTINUE TO LEAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR THE SO FOR THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEMS TO STILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS. THESE LARGER PROGRAMS. YEAH WE WOULD ADD ALL OF THE SERVICES WILL STILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WILL STILL BE THERE SPOTS ABILITY OF THAT COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE- AND AS WELL AS A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES THATWERE MENTIONED- IT'S JUST REALLY AROUND- POLICY CHANGES THAT ALLOW US TO INCREASE ACCESS AND IN IMPROVE OUTCOMES THANK YOU. THIRTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS- FOR THE OVERVIEW- EXCEEDS FIRST WHO- I BELIEVE IT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO FORTUNATELY- WE WERE PENALIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CMS FOR- NOT. YES COMPLYING WITH THE OUTCOME REQUIREMENTS AND ARE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH WATER AND AROMATIC OUR METAL HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS AND- I BELIEVE. THE SITE IS A STATE TO SPREAD THAT EXPENSE OF THE FINALS FOR QUITE SIZEABLE OVER SEVERAL YEARS SO THAT WE DIDN'T HIT. COUNTIES WITH IT ALL AT ONCE AND WE PAID AT ALL OFFERS THAT STILL ON GOING. I MAY HAVE TO ASK FOR MY DAHLE COLLEAGUES AND OR LINDY IF YOU HAVE A- AN UPDATE REGARDS TO THE- THE PAYOFF OF THAT AUDIT. YEAH. I WILL HAVE TO CONFIRM BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE IN THE YEAR HEW OUT OF THE FOUR THAT IT WAS RIGHT ACROSS. BUT I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND BERMAN. OKAY YEAH YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME ON THAT- SO I GUESS THE PART THE PART. PART REASON FOR IT UP TO IS THE- DID RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT- OVERSIGHT. OVER SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. I KNOW THAT WE'RE MAKING SOME IMPORTANT TRANSFORMATIONS WITH CALLING HIM AS WELL- BUT- WHAT WHAT KIND OF OUTCOMES ARE WE MARCHING ACROSS THE STATE SO I KNOW WE TEND TO FOR A LOT TO RAISE COUNTIES WHAT WHAT. HOW WE- AT TRYING TO. DO STATEWIDE- OUTCOMES FOR MENTAL HEALTH GOALS- THROUGH OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM WHAT KIND OF STANDARDS ARE WE- SETTING FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH. PROGRAMS I KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SENATOR PAN SO WE- WE DO HAVE SOME DASHBOARDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON DCS IS WEBSITE TODAY HOWEVER- WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING IN BRINGING ON A CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER AND ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER IS GOING TO BE TO COME TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY OF AN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT STRATEGY FOR OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AREAS- WOULD BE LOOKED ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM WE ARE REPORTING EXTENSIVE METRICS ON THE MANAGED CARE CITED YOU HEARD VERY AWARE OF. OF THAT BUT WE HAVE A VERY LITTLE THAT WE ARE REPORTING PUBLICLY IN REGARDS TO OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM AND SO THE NEW CHIEF QUALITY OFFICER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING A THAT IT WOULD BE STATEWIDE THAT WE WOULD REPORT THOSE MEASURES AND YOU WOULD MAKE THOSE OF COURSE ARE PUBLIC ANDTRANSPARENT I WOULD JUST NOTE- ONE OF THE PIECES OF KALANK WHICH I DIDN'T MENTION EARLIER AND SHOULD UP WAS THAT THE H. Q. I. P. AND THAT B. H. Q. I. P. R. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IS TO HELP FUND SOME OF THE DATA- CHANGES NEEDED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGES NEEDED. SO THAT WE CAN GET THE DATA IN A BETTER WAY FROM THE COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY THE WAY THEY CODED REPORT TO US DOESN'T ALLOW OR HAVE THE BEST OUTCOME- IN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE QUALITY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BROKEN DOWN AT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT THAT THOSE FUNDS HELP PAY FOR THOSE SYSTEM CHANGES SO THAT WE CAN GET IT IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE MORE QUALITY AND OUTCOME. METRICS WITHIN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH. I APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS THINK BEEN LOST THE ISSUE SERVICE I. THEIR MANY COUNTY STAR DUO OUT. JOB AND HERO BUT THERE'S A- AN FOR I THINK WE'VE SEEN INSTANCES. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE GOOD- IT IS IT AND I APPRECIATE AND I MEAN THAT. AND I REALIZE THAT FOR EXAMPLE CMS ISSUE WAS YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE TECHNICAL ISSUES AT CETERA. BUT I THINK IT UNDERSCORED. THE ACT THAT. WELL CERTAINLY WE HAVE MANY OUTSTANDING- COUNTY PROGRAS. THAT WE ALSO OUR STATE AND WE DO NEED TO THAT EVERY PERSON WHO LIVES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST ONE PARTICULAR COUNTIES DESERVE TO HAVE. GOOD ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND- IN SOME WAYS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. PROP SIXTY THREE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A TREMENDOUS BOON BUT SOMETIMES I THINK PEOPLE GET TOO DISTRACTED JUST LOOKING AT THE PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS AND- NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO HOW ARE USING A MEDIC CAL FUNDS. WHICH ACTUALLY IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE RESOURCES WE PUT IN THE MENTAL HEALTH. AND WE NEED TO HAVE STATEWIDE STANDARDS NOW I REALIZE YOU KNOW. DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND WE NEED TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY TO ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. AND SO- I HOPE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP US APPRAISED OF THE EFFORTS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. IN THE TIMELINES AND RESOURCES NECESSARY TO BE SURE WE HAVE THOSE IN PLACE SO THAT WE- SO THAT THERE CAN BE ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE STATE- FOR A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SYSTEM IT. TO TAKE ON THE MEDICAL SIDE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY- I THINK WE'RE ON SIXTEEN. RIGHT SO THE DEPARTMENT DID PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL IN REGARDS TO INCREASING ACCESS TO THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO THE PANDEMIC OF THE CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE REALLY SEEING AN INCREASE IN REGARDS TO YOU- OVERDOSE DEATHS SUICIDES IN AN INCREASE OF NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES- AND THE PANDEMIC I REALLY JUST ACCELERATED- THOSE TRENDS- WE DO NOT. FORGET STOP YOU ONE SECOND AT THE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN MOST MOST ANIMAL AND IS DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION THE LAST ISSUE I'M SORRY FORGOT TO CALL IN YOUR INTO YOUR HAND UP. OKAY. OKAY AND APART IN FINANCE IN THE LAST ONE. YES IT WE ARE ALMOST APARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO LOOK BACK TO SENATOR POUNDS QUESTION ON THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT SETTLEMENT THE STATUS A BIT OF THAT. SO THERE WAS A REPORT SUBMITTED THAT REQUIRE THAT- CALIFORNIA DO PREPAY A HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION ODD TO SEE A MASS FOR ALLOWABLE COUNTY SPECIALTY- MENTAL HEALTH CLAIMS THE STATE PAY FOR IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND- WE HAVE BEEN RECOUPING. COUNTY FUNDS- TO SUPPORT THAT THE AND THE INITIAL INTENT WAS TO RECOUP THAT OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD WE WERE ABLE TO RECOUP THAT FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY I WE WERE UNABLE TO RECOUP THAT DUE TO THE LIMITED REALIGNMENT FUNDS BUT WE ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO RECOUP- STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. NOW WE'RE BACK. TO THE NUMBER- SO THE- IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN- WE SEE THAT WE HAVE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BED CAPACITY- IS ABOUT TWENTY ONE BEDS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND- RESIDING IN A COUNTY HOWEVER ACT EXPERTS ESTIMATE THAT REALLY CAPACITY SHOULD BE AT ABOUT FIFTY PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND- IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO WE ARE WE CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE AROUND A TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT BEDS- WITH THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THE- LEGISLATURE FOR CONSIDERATION WE'RE PROPOSING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND DOLLARS- OVER THREE YEARS WHERE WE WOULD ALLOW FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO INCREASE THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM. INFRASTRUCTURE IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO BOTH COUNTIES AND TRIBES- WE WOULD START THE- THE COMPETITIVE OF PROCESS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWO OF THE INTENT BEHIND THE GRANTS WOULD BE TO ACQUIRE- AND OR REHABILITATE EXISTING REAL ESTATE ASSETS- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE DO KNOW THAT- IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY- WHERE CERTAIN BUILDINGS PROPERTY WILL BECOME AVAILABLE- AND MAXIMIZING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERT THAT INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I WITH THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WE ARE ASSUMING THAT WE WOULD INCREASE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND BEDS SO IT PRETTY SIZEABLE. INCREASE IN REGARDS TO THAT BUT PRINT- WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THE US SERVICES BE ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM I WHICH WOULD INCLUDE OF ALL THE WAY FROM CRISIS STABILIZATION RESIDENTIAL AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED- AN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES A REALLY ALLOWING FOR US YOU ARE IN THE FUTURE I SPEAK AS AN SMI I. C. D- I AND D. WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE ON THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SIDE I TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR I. N. D. STAYS- BUT WHICH WOULD ALLOW THOSE FUNDS. TO COME IN AND FIND ADDITIONAL ACCESS S. TO BEHAVIOR HOW SERVICESAND CAL. AND THIS ALLOWS US TO DENNIS TO THE FEDERAL. THAT CALIFORNIA'S VERY COMMITTED TO EXPANDING OUR MENTAL HEALTH FOOTPRINT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE DAYS- I WOULD ALSO SHOULD I JUST NOTICED THAT- WE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE COUNTY OR TRIBES UP. FLYING A FOR THESE FUNDS PROVIDE A LOCAL MATCH- IT WE ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING AS PROPOSAL- AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE- THAN BEING ABLE TO USE PROPERTY FOR EXAMPLE ON THE LOCAL MATCH IN ADDITION TO STATE GENERAL FUND AN HSA OR OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THAT LOCAL MATCHING WANNA. WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY AND TRIED COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THAT BUDGET SURE THAT'S NOT A BARRIER TO YOU- ACCESSING THESE FUNDS BUT IN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROPOSAL. WE ALSO I'D GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THE CONTINUE ON A WOULD BE LOOKING FOR A COMMITMENT. FROM THE COUNTY'S AND ARE CURRENTLY PROPOSING. I THIRTY YEAR COMMITMENT OF THOSE FUNDS TO SECURE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES IN THE LONG TERM. I IN OR TO BE ENSURE THAT WE ARE CLOSING- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE IN GAPS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WILL BE CONDUCTING A GAP ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT- TO BE ABLE TO INFORM THE AWARD GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. A CLOSING GAPS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ACCESS TO OUTPATIENT AND COMMUNITY BASED. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN TO REALLY GROW THAT THAT FOOT PRINT- ALSO WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO A TO C. H. R. TO CABINET TO MEET AND LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE- HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO OVERSEE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE BONDS TO ENSURE THAT THE FACILITIES ARE MEETING- ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'RE CLOSING CONTINUE IN GAPS WE ARE THE ONES TO LICENSE AND CERTIFY- THESE ENTITIES AND WE DO THINK IT IS THE BEST. A DEPARTMENTS YOU TO OVERSEAS FUNDS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. TO FINANCE. NO COMMENT TO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU BILYEU. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN- KOREA SHEET WITH THE L. A. JUST WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT OUR OFFICE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS ON OUR WEBSITE- DISCUSSION DISCUSSING THIS PROPOSAL AND I'LL JUST GIVE SOME BRIEF REMARKS ON TOUCHING ON SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS THAT WE REYES- FIRST WE JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT. REMAIN UNDER DEVELOPMENT- THESE WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT SPECIFIC MILESTONES COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO RECEIVE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS OR HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE EVALUATED- IT'S ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR THIS PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO RELY ON BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE RATHER THAN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH PROGRAM. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS GIVEN THAT BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TYPICALLY LACKS SPECIFICITY AND DETAIL WHEN. COMPARED TRAILER BILL AND WE FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF THESE FINES- MAYBE SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINED UNDER THE BUDGET BILL APPROACH AND SO WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOT TRAILER BILL. I'M JUST SORT OF ENSURE THAT IT HAS THAT AS THE FISHING ROLE IN THE PROCESS- NEXT TIME WE DON'T WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE CONCEPT OF- EXPANDING BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT CAPACITY STATEWIDE. CERTAINLY IS A VERY PRESSING NEED ACROSS THE STATE- WE ALSO FIND THAT THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT IS% LIKELY A GOOD USE OF THE STREETS- SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME WINDFALL- WE DO FIND THAT THERE'S ENOUGH OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM AND PRIOR STATE- GRANT PROGRAMS INCLUDING- WANTS TO CHINA AS THE ADMINISTRATION JUST- INDICATED. OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH FACILITIES TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY LESSONS LEARNED- FOR EXAMPLE- THE INVESTMENT AND- IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS ACTIVE TWENTY THIRTEEN ESTABLISHED A GRANT PROGRAM UNDER JAVA. TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR FACILITY FOR CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS- WHICH IS ONE OF THE FACILITIES THAT THIS THIS. PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO. FIND AND TO AVOID DELAYS IN DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS UNDER THAT PROGRAM- YOU KNOW- THE STATE SORT OF. MADE THE OPTION AVAILABLE FOR NON PROFITS OR CORPORATIONS TO APPLY FOR FUNDS- DIRECTLY ON COUNTIES BEHALF AND SORT OF BAD THAT SORT OF LIKE. XCELERATED THAT THE PROCESS FOR GETTING- FUNDS OUT THE DOOR AND HELP DEVOID AND DELAYS IN. IN IN THE PROGRAM. WE WOULD ALSO FOR THE THIS PURPOSE HAS. A SICK INTER. WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER MAJOR BUDGET PROPOSALS- IN THE BUDGET FIRST- AS NOTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION EARLIER THE CAL A MEDIC CAL PROPOSAL INCLUDES. A COMMITMENT TO PURSUE A FEDERAL WAIVER OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SERVICES IN INSTITUTIONS THAT NORMALLY MEDICAID WILL NOT PAY FOR- AND AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO GET THIS WAIVER APPROVED. THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO BUILDING UP COMMUNITY TREATMENT OPTIONS TO SORT OF AVOID A DISPROPORTIONATE- INSTANT INCENTIVISING OF INSTITUTIONAL- PLACEMENT- SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IT STANDS ON THAT KALYAN COMMITMENT AND WEIGH. THAT AGAINST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS PROPOSAL- IN ADDITION THERE'S A PROPOSAL IN DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS TO. EXPAND COMMUNITY BASED OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL- INTHE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION HOW IT SORT OF COORDINATING THESE TWO EFFORTS. TOGETHER IN ADDITION- THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRESENTING THIS PROPOSAL AS PART OF ITS OVERALL HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS AND WELL THERE IS CERTAINLY OVERLAP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS- WE FIND THAT A TARGETING OF FUNDS TO. SPECIFICALLY TO INDIVIDUALS- EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO ALSO STRUGGLE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES- WOULD BE A MORE DIRECT WAY TO SORT OF GET OUT THE OVERALL HOMELESSNESS ISSUES THAT THE STATE. ON THE STATE BASIS- AND FINALLY AND YOU KNOW AS THE ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED- THE COUNTIES UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE- REQUIRED TO SORT OF PUT UP A LOCAL MATCH AND- ON THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO SEEK ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO SORT OF ON HOW THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- MATCH LEVEL WAS DETERMINED AND- IN ORDER TO SORT OF ASSESS WHAT WHAT COUNTY'S CAPABILITIES OF. OF PUTTING UP THAT MATCH WITH THE- OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH I GUESS IT WOULD BE ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS IS. THE WE HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS SPACE. DID YOU DID YOU TALK WITH WITH THE- CATCH ON ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS ACT THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING. AND WHY STAND UP A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM WHEN WE'RE- IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS REFORM. VERSUS JUST GOING WITH THE WITH THE AGENCY THAT ALREADY HAS THE EXPERIENCE IN DOING THIS AND COME MORE QUICKLY STAND UP AND JUST A CONTINUE FORWARD. BUT WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO- TO CAP A TO. HEAR AND LEARN FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE HOWEVER- DO YOU FEEL LIKE A GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO OVERSEE THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON. AS WELL AS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR OUR COUNTIES IN REGARDS TO THAT- THAT IT BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE GOING SPECIFICALLY TO CLOSING THOSE CONTINUE I'M GAPS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT FOR EXAMPLE TO YOU- ONGOING. OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT OF FUNDS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE FROM A SERVICE DELIVERY POINT OF VIEW THAT MOVING FORWARD IT'S LARGER THAN JUST- THE FACILITIES AND THE ACQUISITION OF A BUILDINGS AND THE- YOU KNOW REHABILITATION. IT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WE WOULD WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO- SERVICES THAT WOULD BE A LICENSED AND CERTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT THAT IS COORDINATED- SEAMLESSLY WITH US IN OR UPON THE- ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS- AND THAT WE ARE BEING STRATEGIC IN REGARDS TO. THOSE CLOSING THOSE GAPS TO ULTIMATELY REALLY INCREASED I'M AND HAVE A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO YOU- MAKING SURE THE DOLLARS ARE NOT JUST ALLOCATED OUT- OR THAT WERE REALLY CLOSING ON CONTINUE ON. GAPS THAT WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA. I GUESS I WOULD. A I WOULD AGREE WITH THE SECOND PART MAYBE NOT NECESSARY THE FIRST PART AS MUCH BECAUSE I THINK JUST THAT THAT IS A TON OF NEW FUNCTIONS THAT YOU WOULD BE TAKING ON WITH THAT AND THEN THE QUESTION THE L. A. O. ASKED ABOUT COUNTIES AND THIS 25% HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THAT FIGURE AND DO AND HAVE WE ASSESSED BY COUNTY THAT WILL BE ABLE. TO MATCH THAT. SO WE HAVE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF PREVIOUS PROGRAMS IN REGARDS TO WHAT- HAS. REQUIRED A LOCAL MATCH TO SEE THE VARIATION OF THE PERCENT. REALLY GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE COUNTY'S BAIRD REGARDS TO YOU- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. WE DID THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LOCAL MATCH- AND COMMITMENT TO ATTACH TO THE FUNDS PROVIDED. I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT IN REGARDS TO THAT THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- THOUGH WE DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE LOCAL MATCH. GIVEN THAT THOUGH WE ARE TRYING TO BE AND HAVE. ALREADY HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH C. B. H. T. A. N. C.'S ACT. REGARDING FLEXIBILITY AROUND WHAT THAT LOCAL MATCHLOOKS LIKE IT COULD INCLUDE- YOU KNOW COUNTY GENERAL FUND AN HSA FUNDS. ON THE OTHER FUNDS THEY CAN ALSO MATCH IT WITH THE PROPERTY- COST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WE WILL BE. YOU KNOW WILLING TO WORK WITH COUNTIES ON THE FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL MATCH I DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. REGARDING THE RESPONSIBILITY COUNTIES CURRENTLY BEAR. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM SERVICES. THANK YOU. THIRTY PAN. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL BE WILL BE FOLLOWING THIS ONE GREAT INTEREST NUMBER SEVENTEEN PLEASE. COURSE I'M SO WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE ARE PROPOSING TO INVEST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND OVER THREE YEARS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF A GENDER THREE TWELVE- STUDENTS ARE RECEIVING PREVENTIVE EARLY INTERVENTION BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES OFFERED BY SCHOOL AFFILIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED VIA INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- THAT- THROUGH OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS SO ESSENTIALLY THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING A TO HAVE A ROBUST INCENTIVE PROGRAM THROUGH MANAGED CARE TO REALLY A LOOK AT INCREASING ACCESS- TO SERVICES IT WOULD PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. PARTNERSHIPS AND CAPACITY BUILDING- WE DO ALLOW FOR- VARIATION IN REGARDS TO THE TYPES OF INCENTIVES IT COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE A THREE WAY CONTRACTS BETWEEN OUR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN TOWNIES IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IT COULD PAY FOR PLANNING SERVICES FOR HOW DO WE INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. A FOR TELEHEALTH OR BILLING PORTAL- IN IN SCHOOLS I TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO- THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES I WOULD JUST NOTE THE PROPOSAL IS SPECIFICALLY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- CASSIDY BUILDING EXCEPT A SERVICES CAN BE BILLED DIRECTLY IN SEPARATE OUTSIDE OF THIS. THE MAIN REASON WE ARE PROPOSING IT GOES THROUGH THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IS OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ABIDED TO OUR CHILDREN WHICH IS DOMINANTLY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE NEEDING NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WE KNOW THAT ARE COUNTY PARTNERS HAVE MADE A LARGE INROADS IN REGARDS TO PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GET SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN PLACE- AND WE ARE REALLY WANTING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. LOOKING ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM WHERE WE PAY OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PROVIDE OF THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THAT ALL CHILDREN. CAN RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS- AND WE THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAXIMIZE WELL OUR CURRENT FOCUS IS ALSO FOCUSED ON INCREASING ACCESS TO YOU MEDICARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. WE DO HOPE THAT BY PUTTING IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE- THE LIKE THE BILLING SYSTEMS THE DATA SHARING SYSTEMS- THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BETTER BILL MEDIC HOUSE SERVICES AND INTERACT WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS. THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ALL MEDICAL SERVICES ON SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. IN THE IN THE SCHOOLS- WE ALSO THINK THAT BY INVESTING IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY BUILDING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS- THAT IT WOULD IMPACT NON MEDICAL KIDS AND REALLY ALLOW FOR YOU KNOW WELL MEDICARE OUT. IS 5255% OF ALL KIDS ARE ON MEDICAID ALL ON THERE ARE NON MEDICAL KIDS THAT COULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEING ABLE TO A BILL AND- PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE OTHER PAYERS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THINK THAT IS A- YOU KNOW AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD. GREATLY BENEFIT- ALL CHILDREN ACROSS THE- SCHOOL- WE DO ALSO I KNOW THAT THIS IS- WE'RE HOPING THIS WILL BE BRAIDED FUNDING AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER KIND OF FUNDING STREAMS THAT ARE FLOWING IN THIS WAY BUT- THAT'S AN HSA- OR OTHER DOLLARS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HAVE WE PLAN ON PROVIDING EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS COMPLEMENTARY ACROSS- THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE COUNTY'S L. A. BACH- AS WELL AS OTHER- AN HSA. FUNDS BUT WE DO THE IT IS IMPORTANT. TO MAKE TO WE'RE- ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES IN SO. I TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS DO YOU CS IS REQUESTING A LIMITED TERM RESOURCES EQUIVALENT TO TWELVE POSITIONS- WITH THE FUNDING EXPENDITURE OF ELEVEN MILLION TOTAL FUN. I TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL AND HAPPY TO ANSWER-ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE COMES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU BELIAU. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN ACCORDING ISSUED AGAIN WITH THE L. A- AGAIN WE RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS OF THIS PROPOSAL ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE NOW TO SORT OF GET SOME BRIEF REMARKS TOUCHING ON SOME OF THAT THE MAIN POINTS THAT WE RAISED- FIRST WE JUST KNOW THAT SIMILAR TO THE LAST PROPOSAL AND THE CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL THERE THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT- TO OUR UNDERSTANDING ARE NOT SORT OF FULLY FLESHED OUT AT THIS MOMENT TIME. THIS WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THESE SPECIFIC% ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT WOULD DETERMINE HOW THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSING TO- RELY ON THE BUDGET BILL PROCESS TO DONE TO ESTABLISH THIS THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM AS WELL AND WESUGGEST THE SAME SORT OF LIKE TRAILER BILL- APPROACH THAT. I DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE CONTINUUM THE PROPOSAL. WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL WE DON'T RAISE ANY ISSUES WITH THE CONCEPT OF. INCREASING MANAGED CARE PLANS FOOTPRINT IN SCHOOLS- WE DO FIND THAT IT'S NCLEAR WHETHER THE AMOUNT PROVIDED AN INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL ACTUALLY INDUCE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO INVEST IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS- IN THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK ADMINISTRATION HOW IT DETERMINED THAT THIS FUNDING AMOUNT WOULD BE- SUFFICIENT TO SORT OF CHANGE. PLAN BEHAVIOR IN AN INDUCED THE DESIRED- PARTNERSHIPS BEING BEING CREATED- IN ADDITIONWE FIND THAT THE REAL CHALLENGE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO BE. NAVIGATING THE VERY FRAGMENTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM- STUDENTS CAN ACCESS MEDICAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH. SEVERAL INTO DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT COULD BE A COUNTY IT COULD BE A MANAGED CARE PLAN IT COULD BE A SCHOOL DIRECTLY- AND THE ADMINISTRATION TOUCHED ON SORT OF THE- THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH BETWEEN- COUNTIES IN MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT- WHICH ENTITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. FOR WHAT SERVICE THROUGH MEDIC HOW CAN CA OFTEN BE DETERMINED INCONSISTENTLY- AND IN ADDITION COUNTIES MAY ALSO PROVIDE. SORT OF THE SAME SERVICES THAT CAN'T MANAGE CARE PLANS COULD PROVIDE UNDER THEIR NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITIES- AND JUST USE THEIR LOCAL FINES INSTEAD OF- PAYING FOR THE SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE AL AND SO. ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR- THE ADMINISTRATION TO CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT SERVICE GAPS MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD FILL UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. AND IT REALLY ALSO SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE STATE EFFORT EVEN EVEN THINKING MORE GENERALLY OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. TO COORDINATE THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TOGETHER. ON TO ENSURE THAT A ALL THE SERVICES THAT STUDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE MEDIC CALORIE PROVIDED AND BE THAT- NO DUPLICATED SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED BY- EITHER COUNTIES OR OR MANAGED CARE PLANS- WE WOULD ALSO- REYES THAT THERE ARE. A. COUPLE OF OTHER. ALTHOUGH IN THE BUDGET- RELATED TO STUDENT MEADOW HEALTH- YOU KNOW THERE'S A- PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE- IMAGES FUNDS TO SUPPORT A- STATE GRANT PROGRAM TO YOU KNOW SORT OF SUPPORT. YEAH COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS AND THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE- PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS TO SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO MATCH COUNTY. A MED STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND SO- DISCORDANT NATION ISSUE IS- IT THAT SORT OF BRINGS UP THE COORDINATION ISSUE AGAIN SORT OF- RAISES THE ISSUE OF THAT- IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR HOW. THIS PROPOSAL WILL SORT OF INTERACT WITH WITH THOSE OTHER GOALS THAT ARE THERE IN THE BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT SINCE THE DIRECTOR COOPER GUEST. I WE ALL AGREE I THINK AGREE WITH THE IDEA OF INCREASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS AND TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND I AND I BELIEVE THIS IS UP AND IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PROVIDE ACCESS AND STREAMLINE THINGS. BUT HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE TO THE ISSUE THAT IN SOME WAYS IT JUST IT JUST MAKES ONE MORE LEVEL OF CONFUSION. AND POTENTIALLY DUPLICATIVE SERVICES AND NOT A REAL CLEAR PATH ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY GETS CARE. WHAT I WOULD SAY THERE IS THAT THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE A CLEAR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE THE NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND BY CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT SOME COUNTIES MAY CHOOSE TO. USE A LOCAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DO THIS WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO IT IN THE CAPITATION PAID. A RATE THAT WE PAY THEM- AND SO IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT FOR US SINCE WE ALREADY PAYING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THROUGH THAT- FOR THEM TO BE ON ENSURING THAT CHILDREN ARE GETTING ACCESS. TO THOSE SERVICES I THINK WITH THIS PROPOSAL OR TRYING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT MORE UPSTREAM- IN REGARDS TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR KIDS AR GETTING ACCESS EARLY- AND WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS TO BETTER STRENGTHEN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN COUNTY BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS A WHOLE- BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM I TO BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO WE REALLY WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS- I'M STILL A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW TODAY- WITHIN MANY OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS WHETHER TO L. A. BACH OR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH- IT OFTEN TIME IS ONLY AS- REALLY PROVIDED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH- YOU KNOW SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES OR WHEN IT'S IN THE I. U. P. DEPENDING ON WHICH PORTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- AND THERE ARE COUNTIES HAD. WHO HAVE EXPANDED TO THE NON SPECIALTY SIDE TOO EVEN THOUGH ULTIMATELY THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS MANAGED CARE PLANS. HOWEVER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR FULL RIGHTS UNDER U. P. S. U. D.N. UNDER MEDICAID TO ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALL MEDICAL SERVICES- AND SO BY. GIVING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS INTO THE SCHOOLS WELL WE DO NEED TO HAVE BETTER UP COORDINATION WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS IT ALSO ALLOWS ALL OF THOSE OTHER NON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MEDIC HEALTH SERVICES. TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE CHILDREN. THE SCHOOLS AS WELL SO THERE IS THAT ADDITIONAL. OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEVERAGE THE STOCK. IN PUTTING THE AND- IN PLACE THAT DISTRICTS- CAN REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS REPORT FOR A LONG TIME THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO BE IN THE SPACE. BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO BILL MEDICARE HEALTH THEY DON'T HAVE THE DATA SYSTEMS TO DO IT THEY DON'T HAVE THE BILLING SYSTEMS TO DO IT. AND SO THESE INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE REALLY MEANT TO REMOVE THOSE HISTORICAL BARRIERS THAT WE'VE HEARD. I TO BE ABLE TO GET A SPACE WHERE CHILDREN CAN MAXIMIZE THEIR FULL MEDICARE BENEFIT AND NOT JUST A VERY SMALL PORTION WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED TODAY. THROUGH IF SO THE PLANS ARE ALREADY WILL BE DOING IT WHY AREN'T THEY AND WHY DO WE THINK THIS INCENTIVE IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH. TO INCENTIVIZE THEM. IT'S REALLY THE PIECES I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER YOU KNOW IT IS COMPLEX JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS. NOT EASY TO DO- BUT WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS- HISTORICALLY HAVE HAD CHALLENGES UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S NEGOTIATING WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLAN- HOW TO BILL HAVING BUILT SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW FOR THEM TO BILL- AND THEN BE REIMBURSED- FOR SERVICES- XTERRA. AND SO THAT'S WHY DO THESE BONDS ARE FORCED THE SERVICES THAT'S ALREADY BUILT INTO OUR BUDGET TODAY IN REGARDS TO THE CAPITATION RATES GOING OUT. THIS IS REALLY TO DO THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY SO IF THEY WANT TO CONVENE- THE PLAN AS SCHOOL DISTRICT IN COUNTY TO HAVE A PLANNING PROCESS TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE. THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS CAN PAPER THAT PLANNING AFTER IF YOU PLAY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COME IN I TO HELP. MOVE THE NEEDLE IN THE SPACE OR TO PUT IN THE BILLING SYSTEM OR DATA SHARING SYSTEM. OR A TELEHEALTH PORTAL THAT COULD BE IN THE SCHOOLS. THAT ALLOW FOR THE SERVICES TO BE EASIER ACCESS- SO IT'S REALLY PAYING FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PARTNERSHIP AND CAPACITY BUILDING- WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HEARD ARE THE MAIN BARRIERS FOR BOTH MANAGED CARE PLANS YOU WANT TO GET IN THE SPACE. AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO KIND OF GET OVER THOSE HUMPS INSTEAD OF JUST. COVERING IT WITH LOCAL FUNDS WE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ALLOW FOR US TO DRAW DOWN HERE. AS AS WELL AS THE DOLLARS THAT WE PAY OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THIS SPACE AND SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT BEING PRUDENT WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN. LEVERAGING IT TO BE ABLE TO DRAW THOSE DOWN SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE INCENTIVE IS GOOD BECAUSE IT'S- REMOVING SOME OF THOSE HISTORICAL BARRIERS FOR WHITE PEOPLE SAID THEY HAVE. NOT BEEN ABLE TO MOVE INTO THIS SPACE. THANK YOU THE CLIP. THANK YOU A PRE THE THIS PROPOSAL I SHOULD DRESS FIRST OF ALL FOR MY REMARKS BY SAYING THAT- I USED TO BE MEDICAL CONSULTANTS FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN SCHOOL HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH THE MY PERSONAL SITE AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIPS AND SO I HAVE SOME PRACTICAL. KNOWLEDGE AND I APPRECIATE THIS EFFORT SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION. IS THAT WILL YOU HAVE A MANDATE. FOR EVERY MANAGE IT FOR YOU FOR THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PARTICIPATE MEDIC CAL. TO CONTRACT WITH EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN OUR REGION. BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T WANT US AND AT ONE POINT OUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THEY DON'T HAVE OR AND THERE'S A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY THE WAY WHO WERE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MAYBE SOME OF THE LARGER ONES DO BUT FOR GENERALLY THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN HIRING A BUNCH OF STAFF TO NEGOTIATE MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS. I MEAN IT'S JUST BLUNT ABOUT IT RIGHT SO THAT'S WHY I HAVE THAT AND SO IT DID ACTUALLY BUT WHO'S THE MANAGED CARE COMPANIES TO- SEVEN IT AND MAYBE THERE'S A STANDARD CONTRACT OR SOMETHING THAT YOU DEVELOPING CONTENT WITH APART EDUCATION. BUT I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE MANAGED CARE COMPANY HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT OF SOME SORT AND WE CAN. YOU CAN DEVELOP A BASELINE CONTRACT. WITH EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE REGION. THAT IN THEIR SERVICE AREAS SO THAT TODAY ARE COMPELLED TO ACTUALLY TALK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EXPECT SCHOOL DISTRICTS GO TRY TO FIND A MANAGED CARE. MANAGED CARE PLAN- BUSY TRYING TO TEACH KIDS. SO WITH THIS CURRENT PROPOSAL WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HERE IS THAT WE WOULD HIGHER INCENTIVE TO MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THEIR IN THEIR SERVICE AREA OKAY SO THAT'S A TOTAL TO CUT IT MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU REQUIRE THEM TO. SO YES. DIALERS THE ANSWER'S NO WE'RE NOT. HOWEVER I IF I COULD- WE CONSIDER WITH THE PARK. IN THE FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT- PLANS THAT ARE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND THAT THE FUTURE EXPECTATION WILL BE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. DO THAT COMMIT TO AN ATTEST TO- COMMITTING TO THOSE CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE. SERVICES IN SCHOOLS TOTAL SO I DID AND I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT RIGHT SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT- FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. YOU KNOW AND GENERALLY THEY'RE- SOMEWHAT RELUCTANT. TO SAY THAT THIS SET A KIDS. GET THE SERVICES AND THAT'S AT A KIDS DOESN'T NOW YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENCES LIKE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH AT CETERA ALTHOUGH AGAIN FOR YOU HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE WE DROUGHT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S BEING SERVICED BY. YOU KNOW THE TWO PLANNED COUNTY AGENCY COUNTY OR SOME OTHER TO THEIR ACTUALLY MULTIPLE MANA CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT ONE PLAN DECIDED TO CONTRACT THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T AND THEY'RE SITTING THERE HAVING TO SORT OUT AND TELL THIS KID WHO'S ON THAT ACCOUNT NOPE SORRY WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOUR MANAGED CARE PLAN DIDN'T STAR USED AND SO GETS THEM INTO THIS BIND AND THAT AND GENERALLY IF THEY CAN'T GET ALL OF THEM. IT'S THIS IS LIKE IT'S HARD AS A- TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. IF YOU'RE A MEDIC CAL IF BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ON THIS PLANNED AND WILL STILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO YOU THROUGH OUR SCHOOL BUT YOU'RE ON THAT PLAN WHERE NOTS AND HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN TO THE PARENTS TO SAY WILL. GUESS WHAT I'M ON MEDICARE ALSO HOW COME I'M NOT GETTING THIS BUT THAT OTHER KID IS. I MEAN THAT'S A REALLY HARD PLACE TO BE AND I'M NOT SURE JUST LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE EVEN BE IN THAT PLACE AND THAT'S WHY ANSWER SAY. INS AND SOME WAYS THAT IT IN THIS ACTUALLY. MY PERSPECTIVE SPEAKS TO. MEDICAL SERVICES SCHOOL AND GENERAL IS THAT UNLESS YOU FOR THAT YOU BASICALLY YOU NEED TO BE SURE ANY CAN IS A MEDIC CAL AT LEAST WE CAN DRAW A LINE WHERE IF YOU'RE MEDICARE NOT MEDI CAL BUT IF YOU'RE ON MEDICARE AL. THERE NEEDS TO BE A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO THEY'RE NOT CENTER SORTING OUT WHICH PLAN YOU'RE IN LIKE EITHER YOU'RE ON MEDICAID MEDICARE CARD YOU'RE NOT AND YOU GET THE SERVICE RIGHT. AND THEN THERE SOME SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT THEY'RE GETTING AND BY THE WAY THEY DON'T HAVE DIFFERENT BILLING PROCESSES FOR DIFFERENT PLANS BECAUSE THE AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO CATION SPACE THEY DON'T HAVE A BUNCH OF STAFF SAYING. I HAVE TO FILL THESE FORMS FOR THIS PLAN THAT FOR THAT PLANT IS- IN FACT. IF THERE FRANKLY I WOULD SAY IS THAT IS THERE FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. THAT THAT THAT THEY MIGHT PAY FOR THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED BOTH BILLING SYSTEM THAT'S VERY SIMPLIFIED. AND ALSO SOME SORT OF A BECAUSE YOU GOT TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE AT SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT A HEALTH CARE FACILITY ALL RIGHT NOW A CLINIC THEY CAN DEVELOP WHOLE BILLING SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A HOLE RIGHT TO SERVICES AT SENTARA HOSPITAL. EVEN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT JUST TO HAVE THEM HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OVERHEAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INTERFACE WITH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. SO I SOLD FOR SO I GUESS I'D SAY IS THAT. I DON'T MISTAKE THIS I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA I APPROVE OF PRESHEAF PROVIDING INCENTIVES BUT I THINK IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK YOU GOT ALSO LOOK AT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- SO GOVERNOR RIGHT INCENTIVES TO MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT FOR THEM SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEY DON'T SIT THERE AND PARSE OUT. WHICH KID GETS THIS SERVICE WHICH KID GETS THAT SERVICE AT THE SCHOOL. AND I THINK WE DO WANT SCHOOL BASED SERVICES THE SOMEWHERE AT THE SCHOOL BASED SERVICE LEVEL THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SIMPLIFIED WAY THE SAY YOU'RE. GONNA GET PAID FOR THIS THAT AND THAT ON A FIX HE SCHEDULES ARE NOT. SO WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID. AMOUNTS FOR. KIDS FOR THIS SERVICE. AND THEN PERHAPS THE MANAGED CARE AND MANAGED PLAN. TO SO DON'T SIT THERE AND HAVE MULTIPLE. MANAGE YOU KNOW WHAT. KIDS AT ONE MANAGED CARE GETTING SERVICES ANOTHER ONE THAT CAN GET THE SAME SERVICES WE GOT STANDARDIZED PACKAGE THERE. AND THEN OF COURSE THE MANAGED CARE PLAN CAN ALSO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW THROUGH THEIR OWN NETWORKS AND SO FORTH THE NON SCHOOL BASED YOU KNOW STUFF BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE REFERRALS TO COUNSELORS AND STUFF. OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL. THAT DAY AND THEY CAN DO THEIR OWN NETWORK WHATEVER THING BUT IN TERMS OF THEIR INTERFACE WITH THE SCHOOL. IT HAS TO BE. STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE. AND WE MAKE IT. TOO COMPLEX WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING CONTRACTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. EARLY L. DID YOU HAVE TO NEGOTIATE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS THAT MAYBE IT IS A STANDARD CONTRACT THAT'S FINE BUT INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS OR SO FORTH. YOU'RE GONNA NOT THAT THE UP TAKE IT THINGS CAN BE FAIRLY LOW. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MISSING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE'RE NOT GONNA CHIEF THE AIM TO ACHIEVE SO. I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE MAKING AN EFFORT IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT JUST FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE. AND THEN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE TALKING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS I MEAN AFTER ALL THIS THIS WAY- WHEN I WAS HERE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. I HATE I COULDN'T GET THE ACS AND DEPARTMENT I HAD TO FORCE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STATION TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. ABOUT ELLIE A BILL EVEN MEET AND HOW WE GOT A MEETING GOING. I MEAN THAT'S THE DISTANCE THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO CROSS AND THINGS ARE BETTER NOW BUT- I THINK YOU REALLY DO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE UP TAKE PROBLEMS GOING TO BE. AND IF YOU DON'T MAKE THE MANAGED CARE COMPANIES DO SOMETHING YOU KNOW. BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING SIMPLE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SOMETHING CONSISTENT ACROSS. THEN YOU TODAY THEN FORTUNATELY I THINK THIS NOT JUST INCENTIVES. IT HAS TO BE A SET UP A SERVER. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S DEVELOPED. WITH THE USER IN MIND WHICH IS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS WELL OF COURSE THE STUDENTS IN SCHOOL. I ALL YOU. COMMENTS ARE ARE WELL TAKEN AND THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN- THINKING THROUGH ON OUR SIDE BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT- SOME OF THE LARGEST CHALLENGES WOULD BE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY. IN PARTS OF THE STATE- SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK THROUGH CONCEPTS FOR. ON THE HW WE SET UP THE INCENTIVES FOR IF WE DO REQUIRE. I'M CERTAIN PLAYERS BE AT THE TABLE TO RECEIVE THE INCENTIVES OF FOR YOU KNOW THE POINTS THAT YOU'VE EXACTLY MADE. I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO THINK THROUGH THOSE THINGS AND I THINK. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO BRAINSTORM WITH THE LEGISLATURE REGARDS TO HOW TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THE NEED IS THERE- I ACTUALLY THINK YOUR IDEA IN REGARDS TO A STANDARD. A CONTRACT INTO PIECES IS VERY INTERESTING AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK AND CONTINUE TO THINK THROUGH AS THIS. PROPOSAL INVOLVES AND WE FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW WE REALLY CAN MOVE THE NEEDLE IN REGARDS TO YOU- GETTING THESE SERVICES IN SCHOOLS. OKAY WHAT APPRECIATE THAT- I. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THIS SPACE ACTUALLY INTERESTING AFTER. THE PROJECT I WORKED ON FOR- WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WAS ACTUALLY IMPROVING CARE FOR CHILDREN ADHD GET A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE- SO. WE ACTUALLY PUBLISH THE RESULTS IN THE JOURNAL- AND THE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING IS AND YOU THOUGHT AND HOW YOU'RE ALSO ENGAGING THE- EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND THIS. TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW BECAUSE- YOU'RE USED TO. THAT'S WHAT I. AM I'M SURE. THE MANAGED CARE COMPANIES ARE USED WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU DO HAVE THAT. AT THE END OF. TO ALSO NEEDS TO BE. TO BE SURE TO WORK FOR THEM BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE BOTH TO MAKE THIS WORK AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO THEM BUT- IT. I THINK THAT'S- A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE AM VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING. MORE SPECIFICS ON HOW YOU PLAINTIFF TO ROLL THIS OUT THAT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANT THIS TO HAPPEN SO I DON'T MEANT THAT ONLY NEEDS BECAUSE OF YOU JUST LIKE- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS- BUT I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AND I. BUT I ALSO WANT TO SEE SUCCESSFUL ANNA YOU TOO AS WELL AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN SHARE. OUR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES- TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. YES WE WOULD APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS AND WE HAVE.
