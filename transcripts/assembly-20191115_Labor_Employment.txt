I'M AS WE CONTINUE OUR SERIES OF HEARINGS ON THE FUTURE OF WORK WITH THE WITH THE DEEP DIVE INTO WORKER TRAINING INITIATIVES- FOR POPULATIONS THAT BASS BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. SUCH AS THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND LOW WAGE WORKERS- OUR PANELISTS WERE POINT OUT- WORKER TRAINING FOR DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES HAS BECOME A ROBUST AREA OF GOVERNMENT COMMUNITY BASED AND PRIVATE PARTICIPATION. AND OVERALL OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM CARS CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN TRAINING AND SERVICE PROVIDERS CASE MANAGERS AND JOB PLACEMENT COORDINATORS. A PART OF THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO AND UNDERSTAND HOW ALL THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AND DISCUSS WAYS TO MAKE THIS COLLABORATION EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S CERTAINLY AN AREA- HAVING BEEN A FORMER DEPUTY UP DEFENDER. AND NOW IN MY ROOM THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO FIND WAYS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS PART OF OUR ECONOMY AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY.

OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR TRADITIONALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- AND WITH US ARE TIM RAINY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. CHRIS HANNAN OF THE LA AN ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES AND BUYS CHANNEL CHANCER XINYU OUR SENIOR WEBER. OTHER CHANCES OFFICE COMMITTEE COLLEGES I EACH COUNCIL HAVE ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES TO SPEAK IN OUR MIND EVERYONE HERE THAT THIS IS ALL BEING LIVE STREAMED AND DOCUMENTED AND OFTEN TIMES TO GREAT RESOURCE. ARE NOT JUST FOR US BUT OUR STAFFS AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT ARE IN THIS SPACE SO- YOUR YOUR YOUR ABOVE COMMENTS IN YOUR INSIDE IS VERY VALUABLE WE APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU AND SO- MISTER RANEY LIKE TO KICK IT OFF. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHOLERA MY- YOUR- IT IS FOR THE. HELLO THE SWITCH ON THE YEAH WHICH WAY TOO COMPLICATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TEAM RAINY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD I'LL TRY TO MAKE MY COMMENTS- BRIEF BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT OF MUCH SMARTER PEOPLE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE WORK FOR SYSTEM- AS FOLKS KNOW IS REACHING COMPLEX- ITS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S IN THE JOB CENTERS COMMUNITY COLLEGES SCHOOLS- CORRECTIONS PROGRAMS. THAT HELP PEOPLE REENTER- SOCIETY IN THE ECONOMY OF THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION. THE STATE FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN ALL OF THAT SYSTEM IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS APPROXIMATELY SIX BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- SO IT'S NOTHING TO SHAKE A STICK AT IT'S PRETTY. IT'S PRETTY GENEROUS IN SOME SENSE- BUT THERE GAPS IN IN IN BIG WAYS I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A SECOND. WOULD YOU ADD TO THAT STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED SYSTEM MEAN BASE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE IN MANY WAYS FOR THE WORK FOR SYSTEM IN THE STATE. OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS- BUT ALSO THE INVESTMENTS IN EMPLOYERS MAKE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS WHERE- THE CONTRIBUTION FROM PLAYERS IS GREAT BUT IN MANY CASES- WORKERS INVEST IN THOSE AS WELL. THE WAY WE GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS BIG SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS STATE PLANNING THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PUTS TOGETHER A PLAN EVERY FOUR YEARS- IT'S GOT A BIG VISION- BUT IT'S REALLY. FOCUSED ON- NEEDING TOGETHER AND ALIGNING THIS WORK FOR SYSTEM TO GET SCALE AN IMPACT AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES- INCREASED TRANSPARENCY- AND JUST BASICALLY MAKE A WORK FOR SYSTEM THAT WORKS. FOR WORKERS AND PEOPLE LOOKING AND COMPANIES LOOKING FOR TALENT. THE LED BY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S FOR THE MOST PART THE STATE PLANNING IS DONE BY THE STATE BOARD BUT AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS. OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ARE DOING THE HARD WORK OF ALIGNING- THIS BROAD WORK FOR SYSTEM AROUND A COMMON AGENDA ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK WORK FOR SPORTS TEND TO GET A LOT OF FLACK YESTERDAY. WE WERE IN RIVERSIDE- FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMISSION I THINK SOMEBODY. TALKED ABOUT WORKFORCE BOARDS AS CARTELS. I DON'T QUITE AGREE I THINK THERE- THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF IMPRESSIVE WORK AROUND THE STATE- THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CHANGE HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WITH LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD SO I ACTUALLY THINK THEY'RE THE BEST IN THE NATION- THE GAPS THERE ARE STILL MANY- AND AGAIN REFLECTING ON YESTERDAY'S FUTURE WORK COMMISSION MEETING WHICH I THOUGHT WAS- INCREDIBLY SMART- AND INDEED THE WASN'T SERVICE WENT REALLY DEEP ON ON. INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO THE STATE AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA- GOVERNOR GRAN HOME TALKED ABOUT A MOTHER IN GEORGIA TRYING TO RAISE A DAUGHTER ON NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR MOST POOR PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORK THERE TWO MILLION WORKING POOR PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALONE. THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO ATTEND TRAINING OR SIT THROUGH A SEMESTER OF COURSES AND COMMUNICATE WHICH BECAUSE YOU'RE BUSY SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILY. THEY NEED. INCOME WHILE THEY'RE DOING TRAINING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE THE BEST MODEL FOR THIS BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WE HAVEN'T BUILT A PARTNERSHIP- SUBSTANTIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. SO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. NEED TO HAVE INCOME WHILE THEY'RE IN TRAINING TO SUPPORT THEM- THERE. ALSO OR IN ADDITION LEAVE TIME WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK TO GET THAT KIND OF TRAINING IS CRUCIAL. ANOTHER ONE AGAIN- FOCUSES YESTERDAY- IS JOB QUALITY. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH QUALITY JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY FOR EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS A GOOD JOB- AND THE WAY WE DEFINE THIS IT WAS TO FIND YESTERDAY I THINK IT. A FEW TIMES INCLUDES ALL THE THINGS YOU'D IMAGINE JOB QUALITY SHOULD INCLUDE GOOD WAGES OF COURSE BENEFITS- THEY'RE PAID FOR BY EMPLOYERS FOR THE MOST PART- PREDICTABLE WORK SCHEDULES SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. SKILLS TRAINING AND MOBILITY. AND MANY FOR HER VOICE. AND COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY MANY OF THOSE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THOSE PRINCIPLES WE CALL HIGH ROAD- JUST A COUPLE MORE POINTS ON- ON JOB QUALITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A GALLUP SURVEY RECENTLY FOUND THAT TWENTY THREE PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIANS SAY THERE ARE THEY ARE AND QUOTE UNQUOTE BAD JOBS. OUR AND ONE IN FIVE WORKERS. IN CALIFORNIA WHO MAKE LESS THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. HAVE AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE OR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BIG CHALLENGES IN THE STATE AND THE THIRD ONE. I PICKED UP FROM YESTERDAY THERE'S A FOCUS ON ECONOMIC. AND LABOR MARKET CHANGE DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGY AUTOMATION IN THE IMPERATIVES OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE IN MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE- IF WE DON'T ADDRESS TODAY'S INEQUALITIES HOWEVER. WE BAKE THOSE SAME INEQUITIES IN OUR CURRENT LABOR MARKET INTO THE FUTURE WORK. WE'VE GOT TO THIS POINT OF GROSS INCOME INEQUALITY AND WEALTH INEQUALITY NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THIS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF A SHARE PROSPERITY- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT GOING TO FIX EVERYTHING WAS BROKEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD ATTEND THE FUTURE WORK. MEETINGS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF COLOR IS ON THAT MISSION- AND MADE SOME OF THE BEST COMMENTS YESTERDAY AND I DON'T SEE THAT JUST BECAUSE HE'S IN THE ROOM- BECAUSE ACTUALLY TRUE AND IS ON FILM SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT FOR YOURSELF- I THINK A LOT OF THIS. WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS A BIT OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IT'S ENFORCING LABOR LAW- IT'S CRAZY POLICIES AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL CYNOSURE JOB QUALITY. OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DOES HAVE A ROLE AT THE STATE BOARD OUR BIG IDEA IS THE BILL THE HIGHROAD ECONOMY DEFINED BY QUALITY JOBS EQUITY JUSTICE IN CLIMATE BILLION SEE THIS IS THE GUIDING WORK OF THE STATE- IT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT'S THAT'S- BEHIND CREATING A NEW FUTURE WORK DEPARTMENT OF CITY CALIFORNIA THAT'S GONNA LINE. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INSTRUMENTAL WALKING THE TALKING. SAME WAY WE WANT TO ALIGN THE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THE REGIONAL LOCAL LEVELS TO GET THAT SCALING IMPACT. I THINK ALSO THIS IS WHERE WORKFORCE IN DEVELOPMENT REALLY COME TOGETHER THE OVERLAP IN IN A ROW IN THE RIGHT WAY WE START WITH THE BEST JOBS IN INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT ARE DRIVING EMPLOYMENT WE SUPPORT COMPANIES AND EMPLOYERS THAT CARE ABOUT SKILLS TRAINING AND MOBILITY AND VALUE WORKER VOICE- THESE COMPANIES TREAT THEIR WORKERS NOT AS COSTS BUT IS ASSETS THAT THE INVEST IN WE CALL THESE HIERO COMPANIES. ADDITIONALLY WE CREATE ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED. GOOD JOBS BY LINING THE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND CONNECTING PATHWAYS. TO JOBS FOR PEOPLE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SOMETHING A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD AT REMOVING BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT DOING EQUITY WORK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INSURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING BRIDGES. TO COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY OFFER THE BEST JOBS AND THEN SUPPORTING THOSE COMPANIES SO THERE MOST COMPETITIVE AND THEY GROW IN THE STATE. AND CREATE NEW JOBS. IT TURNS OUT THAT ECONOMIC JUSTICE- IS GOOD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. QUALITY JOBS PRIME THE PUMP THEY PUT DOLLARS IN THE POCKETS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE WORK AND SPENDING THEIR COMMUNITIES. ARE IT ALSO PAYS DIVIDENDS IN THE LONG TERM GOOD JOBS. AND ECONOMIC SECURITY- PAY OFF EXPONENTIALLY BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES THAT FACT THAT PEOPLE BEEN LOCKED OUT COMMITTEES BEEN LOCKED OUT OF PROSPERITY FOR GENERATIONS. IF WE BUILD STRONG FAMILIES WITH GOOD QUALITY JOBS JOBS TODAY. IT PAYS OFF IN THE FUTURE WE- WERE IN FRESNO LAST WEEK FOR THE REGION'S RISE TOGETHER EVENT- FROM THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WAS VERY GOOD EVENT. BEFORE THAT HAPPENED THAT EVENT TOOK PLACE WE WERE TALKING TO A GROUP OF BUILDING TRADES UNIONS AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ABOUT HIRING CONSTRUCTION CREWS WORK- AND THEIR- WAS IN MAN NAMED JOHN GOMEZ. WHO GOT INTO CONSTRUCTION THROUGH THE MULTI CRAFT HIERO CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAM IN FRESNO. HE DESCRIBED IT HE WAS IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL A YOUNG MAN IN AND OUT OF PRISON. HE'S NOW A UNION PLUMBER. HE SAID WHEN HE COMES HOME FROM WORK HIS SON PUTS HIS BOOTS ON. AND PUTS HIS HARD HAT ON AND SAYS I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT- JOHN WAS FILLED WITH PRIDE WHEN HE DESCRIBED AS- A YOU COULD SEE HIS FACE YOU COULD SEE IT IN HIS BODY LANGUAGE- HE'S NOT A COST TO THIS COMMUNITY. HE'S AN ASSET TO HIS COMMUNITY. HE MADE A BETTER LIFE FOR HIS FAMILY. THEN HE HAD. AND HIS KIDS ARE MAKING IT. A BETTER LIFE WILL MAKE A BETTER LIFE FROM THEIR FAMILY- SO IT PAYS OFF EXPONENTIALLY. OVER THE LONG TERM SO WE CAN START TO CORRECT. THE INEQUITIES OF THE PAST. BY DEFINING A FUTURE WORK THAT'S BASED ON DIGNITY. I WOULD ALSO WANT TO SAY. JUST REAL QUICK TO SET UP THE HIGHER CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIP THAT YOU CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT- WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AT THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- OVER FIVE YEARS AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING TO EXPAND HI RECONSTRUCTION CREWS IN THE STATE- THESE ARE PARTNERSHIP THE BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS- TO GET ACCESS TO STATE APPROVED PARTNERSHIP. TO PEOPLE IN POPULATIONS COMMITTEES WHO HAVE BEEN WHO HAVEN'T HAD THAT ACCESS STATE WOULD APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. USING THE MOST CRAFT OR CURRICULUM- THIS IS CREATING CITY IN THE TREES THAT WE EVER SEEN BEFORE THAT CHRIS WITH MORE ABOUT. ONE THING IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU MAKING THOSE PROGRAMS WORK IS NOT PUSHING PEOPLE AND LABOR MARKETS TO FINISH. BUT SPENDING THIS WEEK. JOBS SO USING HUMAN WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS THEIR SURPRISE. THAT IT PULLED PEOPLE OUT OF OUR PRE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAMS INTO SOME OF THE BEST JOB THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE THAT DON'T REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. HI RETRAINING PARTNERSHIPS ARE SIMILAR BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT XIN- INTO A SECTOR OF FOLK. COMPANIES ON IT I THINK PATHWAYS TO THE JOB CONNIE BUILT THESE IN EIGHT INDUSTRY SECTORS IN THE. STATE THE DEMONSTRATION WORK OF THE LAST SIX YEARS AND WE'RE- GAS REDUCTION MILLION DOLLARS OVER. AND I'LL- THANK YOU MY THE AND YOU'RE DOING. THURMOND THANK YOU FOR THE BACKGROUND ON THE AND THEN THERE WILL BE TIME FOR QUESTIONS. SUGGESTED THAT WE GO. THE TIME FOR. A SEPARATE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL I'M UP. THIS IS A. GOOD THING HONORABLE CHAIR AUDIBLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE BUILDING TRADES ON THE PANEL THIS MORNING. OUR BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL IS LOS. ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY IS BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES WE REPRESENT FORTY EIGHT. WHO THE FINAL IN THE OPTION IT. THEY REPRESENT A HUNTER AND HE THOUGHT. THE FOUGHT FOR ALL THE WAY WEEK WE GOT A BIG THE FIVE. OUT OF A SHIP. PROGRAMS. TRAINING CENTER LOCAL CENTERS. WE GET INTO THE PRESSURE PROGRAM WE GO TO WORK TURN ON. FROM. A GOOD WAGE MOST OF THE PROGRAMS ARE STARTING AROUND TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR WITH FULL BENEFITS HEALTH CARE FOR OUR OUR IS IT AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE KEY TO. GETTING INTO ONE OF THE PROGRAMS AS BEING THE BEST A COMPACT TO TEND TO WE'VE HAD. VERY GOOD LUCK IN THE ANDERSON ORANGE COUNTY. BROWN BEEN. SEVEN YEARS SET UP PARTNERSHIPS WITH. COMMUNITY COLLEGES LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE OVER TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS TODAY. AND WE HAVE BEEN DELIVER IT TO SET UP SHIP SO. A LOT ANGELES AND INTO THE CAN OF ORANGE SO THAT THE Q. HAVE US SO THAT DISADVANTAGED YOUTH HAS ACCESS SO THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE MAY HAVE NOT. DONE THE BEST JOB REACHING IN THE PAST. WE HAVE SEARCHED FOR SOME COMMUNITIES WERE WERE WORKING WE HAVE. COMMENTS WITH CALLS FOR CONTRACTORS WE SET UP THESE PROGRAMS THE- THE COMMUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE GOOD CAREERS WERE NOT ALL I'M JUST ANY CAREER. WHERE ARE THE SAME CAREER THAT. I START AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO WERE OFFERING THE SAME TO THE COMMUNITY BUT OUR CLASS CLASSES LOOK LIKE OUR PRESSURE BRAIN IS PROGRAMS THEY LOOK LIKE ENERGY. WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES IT REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITY IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES IF WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN NORTHERN LA COUNTY LOCATED IN EITHER LANCASTER PALM BILL IT REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITY IT LOOKS LIKE THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY. IN STATE PRISON. THEY REPRESENT THE POPULATION IN IN THE IN THE PRISON WE DO OUR VERY BEST TO PREPARE THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE COMPETITIVE TO GET INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM NOT ONLY COMPETITIVE TO GET IN BUT TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING SO WE TAKE TIME INTRODUCED THEM TO THE THANKS WE DON'T JUST USE THEM TO ONE TRADE OR WE THINK IT WOULD BE WIENER. ALL THE TRADES SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THEIR OWN ON WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO APPLY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SENIORITY IN THE TRADES WE DO OUR BEST TO WORK OURSELVES OUT OF A JOB EVERY DAY AND THERE'S TOUGH DAYS IT'S STILL A TOUGH WAY TO MAKE A LIVING. YOU HAVE TO REALLY WANT TO BE THERE TO DO GOOD SO WE INTRODUCED THE STUDENTS TO ALL THE TRADES. WE GIVE THEM IN FOR WILL LET THEM MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION AND WE HELP SUPPORT THEM SO AFTER INTRODUCED THEM TO ALL THE TRADES WE TAKE THEM ON TOURS OF DIFFERENT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING CENTERS. SO THAT THEY GET A CHANCE TO. RELATE WITH APPRENTICES IN THE PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT JUST A PROGRAM FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S NOT A PROGRAM FOR. CERTAIN GENDERS- THIS THE PROGRAM FOR EVERYBODY AND WE WANT TO BRING THE STUDENTS OUT TO APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING CENTER SO THEY HAVE A CHANCE. TO SEE WHAT OUR PREMISE LOOKS LIKE TO SEE WHAT AYE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE. FIRST HAND. WE GIVE THEM THE- THE WE RUN THROUGH THE TENER OSHA SO THAT SAFETY IS BUILT INTO THE CULTURE FROM THE FIRST DAY. SAFETY IS BUILT IN. IT'S STILL A DANGEROUS. PLACE IT'S A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO WORK SAFE IN A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT. WE DO CONSTRUCTION- APPLIED MATHEMATICS THERE'S MATH INVOLVED IN ALMOST OUT OF EVERY ELEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION EVEN IF WE DON'T THINK IT'S MATH THERE'S MATH INVOLVED WE'RE GONNA INTRODUCE THEM TO THE TOOLS IN THE MATERIALS OF THE TRADES. BLUEPRINT READING THEY'RE GONNA LEARN MORE ABOUT BLUEPRINTS WHEN THEY GET INTO APPRENTICESHIP. BUT THEY NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT ONCE THEY GET INTO APPRENTICESHIP TO BE A SUCCESSFUL THEY NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE HERITAGE OF AMERICAN WORKER. DIVERSITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY GREEN CONSTRUCTION FINANCIAL LITERACY. WE'VE SET UP THEIR SHIPS. WITH THE. SET UP A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION SOME HAVE PROVED NOT TO BE A ARE NOT TO BE DIFFICULT IF WERE DELIBERATE WERE DELIBERATE FOR FORMAL INCARCERATED WERE DELIBERATE TO INVOLVE. PARTNERS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE ALL. ISSUES HELP PEOPLE GROW AND THEN SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE. FOR MY CAR SERRATED THE SECOND IS A PROGRAM THAT'S MADE UP OF 49% WITH A HISTORY OF- INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY'RE GETTING INTO CAREERS CARTING AROUND TWENTY DOLLARS ARE WHEN THEY FINISH THEY HAVE TOTAL WHERE THEY ARE. FROM THE FORTY DOLLAR AN HOUR RANGE. OVER THE DOLLARS NOW. THEY HAVE A CHANCE. STYLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ORANGE COUNTY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE IN WAS- WAS A BEAR THERE WAS NOT NECESSARILY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IN SETTING UP THESE PARTNERS MOST OF MY- FUNDED. THERE'S UP. WHEN THE COURTS. I FOR THE NEXT GRANT. THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET THE NEXT GRANT WE WANTED TO TAKE A BIGGER. OUR PARTNER SWITCHED ON PROFIT SO THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN GOING AFTER SECURE AND STABLE FUNDING FOR AGES. WE SET UP AND PROFIT WE HAVE. OTHER WITHOUT WARNING AND AS OF YESTERDAY WE JUST HIRED A CASE MANAGER TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE THE BEST CASE MANAGERS ANYWAY. BRILLIANT YEAH. ALL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE QUALITY CASE MANAGEMENT QUALITY. THANK YOU. WORKING PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY HERE- AND UP NEXT ANY. THE CHANCES OFFICE SECURITY COLLEGES. GOOD THING CHECK OUR. STATION HERE TO TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. THE VICE. A PERSON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHANCELLOR'S ALL CALIFORNIANS ME COLLEGES. THE PROGRAMS OF FALLEN DIVISION. INCLUDES THE STRONG FORCE KATO STRONG WITH FORCE I'LL MAKE A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ADULT EDUCATION. OTHERS TODAY THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO- HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ALL PROGRAMS I THINK THAT ARE VERY RELEVANT TO OUR CONVERSATION TODAY AND THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA DAHLE EDGY PROGRAM. AND THE CALIFORNIA PUNISHED. THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS AND SERVES THE LOW INCOME THE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING AN UNEMPLOYED IN JOEL. THOSE WITHOUT A HIGH PALOMA AN ILLITERATE ADULTS EIGHTEEN YEARS AND OLDER. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY IN PATHWAYS IN THE. AND FOR THE HONORABLE OUR POPULATIONS. WITH THE FIVE POINT TWO MILLION ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. AN ADULT EDUCATION OFFERS A VIABLE OPTION TO GAIN CATION. BE ABLE TO OTHER YOUR AND FEEL I'M PREPARED TO ATTEND COLLEGE. AND THE CURRENT ADULT EDUCATION SYSTEM SERVES OVER ONE MILLION ADULTS THROUGH PROGRAMS RUN BY K. TWELVE PROVIDERS COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DOES. TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS CASSIDY OF THE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM AND FINING CREDIT AND CREDIT PATHWAYS TO HELP ADULTS UP SKILL IN ACCESS FINANCIAL AID AND OTHER SUPPORT ALONG THE WAY YOU CAN HE- WITH FIVE POINT MILLION ADULTS WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND US ONLY BE ABLE TO CURRENTLY SERVE A MILLION. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATORS A PAST AB ONE OH FOUR WHICH LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT. I'M FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. THE CHANCES ARE OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND THE SUPREME OF PUB STRUCK XIN. THIS BILL. ONE REGIONAL CONSORTIA EACH COMPRISE OF SEGMENTAL REPRESENTATION TO DEVELOP THE ADULT EDUCATION GENERAL PLANS. FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT PROVIDE A LOT OF. IMPROVED PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES. SERVE THE ADULT POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IN NEED OF SKILLS AND TRAINING TO SAID Q. OF THE MIDDLE SKILLED SHOPS. PROVIDERS WHO RECEIVE FUNDING LOOSE. DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OTHER SCHOOLS AND STATE PROGRAMS. THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN A FATHER CONSISTENT LEVELS WITHOUT. ASIAN PROGRAMS AND FIVE. MINUTES ACTUALLY PRETTY SICK. AND THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY IS WORKING THROUGH SOME. I. YOU KNOW- TIME COMPETITION THAT HAS CREATE BEEN CREATED THE SYSTEM SILOS AND ALSO WORKING ON FINAL A LOT EIGHT A CURRICULUM SPECIFICALLY ADDING THE BIGGEST PIECE THAT IS THE DATA. THAT WHICH YOU ARE IN PLACE THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT DATA THAT WILL HELP US BETTER DIRECT INVESTMENTS JUST GIVE YOU SOME. I ABOUT THE A POPULATION THAT'S BEING SERVED 40% 40% ENGLISH THE OWNERS 24% ABOUT ELEVEN OFFER AND A CULT HAVE ACTUAL BARRIERS AND WE HAVE- YOU KNOW IT SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE WITH LOW LITERACY SINGLE PARENTS LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED- WE HAVE JUST A DISABLED EX OFFENDERS DISPLAYS HOME WORKERS THE HOMELESS CEDAR SEASONAL FARMWORKERS MIGRANT WORKERS TO USE AND TENNIS RECIPIENTS. OF ALL BEINGS IDEA DAHLE AT PROGRAM. JEAN GEARS WANNA TALK A LOT ABOUT MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS. EIGHT IT'S FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND- ESPECIALLY THE BUILDING TRADE JOBS THAT PROVIDE VERY WELL PAYING- CAREERS FOR A FOR INDIVIDUALS. OUR INVESTMENT IN IN THE FIFTEEN MILLION A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN GOING INTO- TRYING TO CREATE A PARTNERSHIP OR ON AND LEARN PROGRAMS IN NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRY SUCH AS HEALTHCARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WE ARE EXPLORING THE UP APPLICATION OF EARN AND LEARN PROGRAM FOR TEACHER PREPARATION I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF PROMISE THERE- THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY FOR THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED- EMANCIPATED FOSTER YOUTH INDIVIDUALS FACING MENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE- IN PARTICULAR AS AN EXAMPLE WE DO HAVE A CULINARY APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT- THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT KITCHENS FOR GOOD AND GROSSMONT UNION HIGH SCHOOL ADULT ED PROGRAM. AND IT BRAIDS PHILANTHROPY EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS CPAP ANOTHER FUNDING FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND SERVES- VERY DIVERSE POPULATION 28% AFRICAN AMERICAN 34% HISPANIC- 28% NATIVE ALASKAN AT PRODUCING ABOUT TO OVER TWO HUNDRED APPRENTICES AND THE OTHER THING I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IT'S 61% FEMALE. SO THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE REPRESENTATION IS PRETTY DIAPERS. IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING INITIATIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS- AREAS FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMITTEE- WOULD BE SUPPORTING MORE APPRENTICESHIP AND EARN A LOAN PROGRAMS I THINK- EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO PARTNER WITH ORGANIZATIONS WITH COLLEGES THE DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS WE CAN'T DO THESE WITHOUT EMPLOYER PARTNERSHIPS- MOST OF OUR STUDENTS. AND ADULT LEARNERS ARE NOT ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL FULL TIME- SO THE SCHEDULING AND FLEXIBILITY OF PROGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. PARTICULARLY I WOULD WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- SHORT TERM WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS WE HAVE OF VERY SMALL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT UNITS THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE VERY RESPONSIVE VERY NIMBLE AND GOOD PARTNERS WITH INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE ABLE TO STAND UP OUR TRAINING VERY QUICKLY TO ADDRESS THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS. TO FOCUS ON SHOP TURN SHORT TERM TRAINING FOR GOOD CAREERS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THESE PROGRAMS ARE THERE NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T FALL ON THE CREDIT BEARING SIDE THEY'RE NOT WELL FUNDED- CONTRACT THAT EDUCATION IS AN EXAMPLE AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN AND INVESTMENT INTO THAT PARTICULAR SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS STATEWIDE TO CAPTURE THE OUTCOMES- BUT A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS DO PRODUCE JOB PLACEMENTS AND THEY PUT PEOPLE INTO CAREERS AND THEY ARE A VERY GOOD AVENUE IN. IN DEVELOPING LIFELONG LEARNING IN AN ENTRY INTO EDUCATION THAT CAN EVENTUALLY LEAD TO CREDIT BEARING PROGRAMS AND NON CREDIT PROGRAMS. AND ANOTHER AREA FOR CONSIDERATION IS THE THERE ARE JOBS THAT ARE IN HIGH DEMAND OUT THERE THAT NOT THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON BECAUSE OF THE PAY WAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE HOME ON HEALTH AIDE- THERE'S A HUGE DEMAND WE ARE ASKED TO DO A LOT OF TRAINING. THE CONCERN HAS BEEN AROUND THE WAGES AND SO DO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU FIND CAREER PATHWAYS INTO OTHER HIGHER PAYING WAGES FROM THESE KINDS OF JOBS WHICH ARE IN DEMAND- DIMENSION- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT KEY PART THAT I THINK COULD ME COLLEGES REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON. IT DOES TWO THINGS A CREE INNOVATION IN PROGRAMS IT CREATES MORE INNOVATION AND A DIFFERENT MINDSET FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OPERATIONS AT ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO PROVIDES A LOT OF VERY GOOD EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS FOR STUDENTS WHEN WE TEACH THEM THAT ON TO BRING MINDSET ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL COMMUNITY I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL BEING ABLE TO CREATE A JOB FOR THEMSELVES RATHER THAN TAKE A JOB. IS PARTICULARLY. IMPORTANT. FINALLY I JUST WANNA MENTION THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON IN A SYSTEMS A LINEMAN TRYING TO ALIGN AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE EXISTING INVESTMENT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN MADE. A PART OF OUR CHALLENGES IS- A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE- DEVELOP AND OPERATE IN SILOS BECAUSE OF JUST THE WAY. I THINK THAT LEGISLATION ON FUNDING IS ENACTED AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO MAXIMIZE LEVERAGE AND COLLABORATE ACROSS THE PROGRAMS. SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME THINGS THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THANK YOU. SO MUCH A BASS CHANCELLOR WEBER AND IF PM AND YOU OFFER SOME REALLY GOOD. SUGGESTIONS OF THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE IF I COULD BEFORE I BRING IT BACK- TO MY COLLEAGUES. EACH OF YOU- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A- A LIMITATION AND WE DO HAVE SOME GREAT CHAMPIONS APPEAR ABOVE HOW MUCH WE CAN DO A ONE TIME IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE THINGS LIKE A THIRTY SECOND LIGHTING AROUND ONE THING COULD BE BUDGET. REGULATION OR LEGISLATIVE ACT. WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE DO TO HELP YOU IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. OKAY I WOULD SAY INVEST IN THE SHORT TERM A WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND CONSISTENT FUNDING LIKE WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH CREDIT. OF BEARING PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE FOR PROFITS. AND THAT HELPS- STUDENTS REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN AS WELL AND THAT THAT. THANK YOU. BUT I HAVE TO GO AHEAD SO THIRTY SECONDS TO GO HEAD TO. A THE FIRST IS- I TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR- SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE- THE THIS WE DON'T HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY THAT KIND OF A RESOURCE- A AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO. WHO NEED SUPPORT IN GOING THROUGH TRAINING PROGRAMS- WORK FOR SPORTS HAVE A LITTLE COLLEGES HAVE SOME- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PROBABLY PROVIDE THE MOST SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED ACCESS TO JOBS- BUT WE NEED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO ALLOW PEOPLE. TO HAVE INCOME WHILE THEY GO THROUGH THESE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL THAT'S ONE OF THE SECOND IS MORE ON THE JOB QUALITY SITE I THINK THE STATE COULD DO MORE. IN ATTACHING. PRIORITIES ARE VALUES TO DOLLARS THAT COME OUT FROM THE STATE CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT. THAT COULD HELP DRIVE JOB QUALITY AROUND THE STATE IF WE DID THAT A STATE LEVEL. BUT ALSO THE LOCAL MUSICAL LEVELS WE COULD REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON JOB QUALITY IN THE STATE OF THE WAY YEAH THEN I DID COME OUT YESTERDAY DURING THE COMMISSION HEARING NOTHING IT'S GOOD POINT FOR THE FOR THE BILL. FOR THE BUILDING TRADES IN OUR WORK. LET LIMIT TO HOW MUCH WE CAN HELP AND HOW MUCH OPPORTUNITY THERE IS HOW MUCH WORK OPPORTUNITY AND NOT JUST WORK OPPORTUNITY RANDOM WE NEED- A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT TO BUT BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE EMPLOYING OUR MEMBERS WE NEED A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT THAT SETS HIRING GOALS. TO FORWARD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS SO WHEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY IN A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT TO SUPPORT OUR PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT- COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THE COMMUNITY. WIN WIN ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE TIM'S TOO AND THERE I MUST MAKE A SECOND ONE IF YOU COULD GIVE THE FUNDS WE HAVE TO HAVE REGULATION BUT IF THE FUNDS CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY. TO TAILOR TO THE PROGRAM NOT EVERY INDIVIDUALS THE SAME YOU COULD HAVE SOMEONE TAKING ONE OF OUR CLASSES AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT THE CLASSES GRAY. CHECK THE TOWARDS THE AND- GREAT INSTRUCTOR GREAT SUPPORT GREAT OPPORTUNITY SOMEONE DOES VERY WELL FOR SOMEBODY THAT- MAYBE WENT THROUGH THE FOSTER YOUTH SYSTEM. MAYBE SOMEBODY THAT JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS REQUIRED SOME INDIVIDUALS A STIPEND COULD REALLY HELP THEM STAY IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM A CASE MANAGER TO HAVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO STAY IN THE TRAINING PROGRAM. ONCE THEY GET INTO THE NEXT LEVEL OF TRAINING WE NEED TO STILL HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT INTERACTION FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT SO NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS THE SAME OR HAS THE SAME NEEDS SO ALLOWING US TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORK FORCE DOLLARS TO HELP US SUPPORT THOSE. I REALLY LIKE TO VERY SPECIFIC GAS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE THE SIMPLE HEARINGS ARE WE HAVE MEMBERS UP HERE THEIR CHAMPIONS THAT THAT WOULD BRING FOR LEGISLATION WILL CERTAINLY. PUT TOGETHER THE DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS AND AN OFFER THEM UP AS POTENTIAL EVEN LEGISLATION INTO THE NEXT YEAR AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT- MY COLLEAGUES. PLEASE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR. SO. AREA I AM SO THANK YOU FOR COMING FOR THE BUILDING TRADES BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS WHAT I USE IS THE MODEL AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF THAT IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE TO BE THE MODEL FOR- WORKERS WHO MAYBE DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE BUT CAN HAVE- A MIDDLE CLASS OR UPPER MIDDLE CLASS JOB- WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT BUT THE REASON I POINT THAT OUT AND MY QUESTION IS TO MR RAINY. WE'VE BEEN AT THE STATE WE JUST PASSED A BILL TO ALLOW- ORGANIZING A CHILD CARE. AND A PART OF THE I THINK INTENTIONALITY THAT SOME OF US ONE OUT OF THAT REALLY IS MODELED AFTER THE TRADES YOU KNOW A HUNDRED YEARS AGO A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO SOMEBODY DECIDED. THE BUILDING TRADES JOBS WE CAN BE GOOD JOBS AND INCLUDED TRAINING IN OSHA STANDARDS AND- PREVAILING WAGE AND- DAVIS BACON AND YOU KNOW WE COULD GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE GOAL OF P. LA. DO WE HAVE ANY PRO I IN I FEEL LIKE WITH CHILD CARE FOR US TO RAISE THE WAGES OF A JOB BY THE WAY THAT CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED THAT CAN'T BE AUTOMATED- THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE. A COLLEGE DEGREE IN SOME ASPECTS OF MY FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION BUT- DO WE HAVE TRAINING PROGRAMS OUT THERE IN PLACE THAT WILL HELP WITH THAT COMPONENT TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE SEE IT. AS A HIGH QUALITY JOBS IN THAT WE CAN PUSH PEOPLE TOWARDS A CAREER IN CHILD CARE THE WAY WE HAVE. MAYBE MODELED AFTER THE TRADES. THIS IS THANK YOU THAT THAT'S A- THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS INVESTED IN- OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH YES YEAH YOU. DEVELOPING A CHILD CARE PROGRAMS ON THE STATE- FOUR ROUNDS. OF FUNDING FROM US TO HELP DEVELOP- PROGRAM IN PROFESSIONAL IS THAT WORKFORCE- AND THEY'VE EVEN STARTED DEVELOPING A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS- IT'S EXTRAORDINARY WORK IN THE STATE AND I SEE THAT IT. THE POTENTIAL FOR X. SCALING THAT BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THE GOVERNOR OF THIS AND THE LEGISLATURE- HAVE REAL POTENTIAL NOT FOR PEOPLE- ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WHICH IS LARGELY WOMEN WOMEN IN IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE- PROFESSIONAL ISING INCREASE THEIR WILL THEIR WAGES BUT ALSO NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. TAKING GOOD JOBS- SO I SEE A LOT OF POTENTIAL THERE. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO. CHRIS JUST TOOK A QUICK QUESTION. IS WHAT PERCENTAGE I DON'T THINK THIS IS WELL KNOWN PUBLICLY. CENTER AGE OF THE COSTS IN THE BUILDING TRADES APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE PRIVATE AND WHICH ARE PUBLIC. THE FUNDS. SO FOR THE BUILDING TRADES APPRENTICESHIPS- THEY THEY REALLY PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE UNION AND ITS MEMBERS AND THE CONTRACTORS WE HAVE OUR MODEL IS A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WE OF BARGAINS- TRAPPING DOLLARS SO MOST OF THE FUNDING IS ALL PRIVATE AND IT WAS PAID FOR ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER- IN THE BENEFIT OF THE MEMBERS- THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT THAT DOES COME FROM THE STATE- BUT IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WE'RE INVESTING OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA- PAID FOR BY THE EMPLOYERS. ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS. A GREAT. AND TIM IF YOU COULD IF THERE WERE SPECIFIC YOU MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF PROCUREMENT. ATTACHING CHAU QUALITY TO PROCUREMENT CAME UP- I HAD A BILL- WHICH WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH- ABOUT JUST GIVING US. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR DOLLARS. THAT GO TO QUOTE UNQUOTE JOB CREATION- SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND SIGNED. A JUST TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM OUR STATE. AS TO HOW MUCH OF. MONEY EVERY TIME THERE'S A CONTRACT SIGNED THAT HAS JOB CREATION AT THE CENTER OF IT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW IF THE EMPLOYER IF THE COMPANY IS COMING THROUGH WITH THAT. SUCH AS WHEN I DID IT OCCUR TO A UP TO US ARE THERE OTHER SPECIFIC IDEAS. AS MENTIONED EITHER FUNDING OR LEGISLATION. THAT HAVE COME UP. I IN A COUPLE OF IT IT OF EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT'S WORKED IN SACRAMENTO- ON THE NEW STATE BUILDINGS GOING UP DOWNTOWN- WE SEE THE CRANES WE SEE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF BOTH OF THOSE- OUR INTER PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT BUT THERE ALSO IS CHRIS DESCRIBED A SOCIAL BENEFIT BUILT INTO THOSE REPUBLIC A COMMITTEE WORKFORCE AGREEMENT- THAT SOURCES NEW APPRENTICES FROM THE PRE CONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAM- IN SACRAMENTO IN A COLLABORATION WITH. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE WORK FORCE FOR THEIR AND THE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL SO THAT DIRECT PATHWAYS INTO THOSE CONSTRUCTION DROPS FOR THE NEW APPRENTICESHIPS LOTS OF OPENING UP- I THINK THAT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED ACROSS ACROSS THE STATE SO WE STARTED WITH THOSE TO STAY BUILDINGS IN DOWNTOWN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COULD BE DONE A TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE TO D. G. S. THAT IT COULD BE DONE- WE'VE GOT SOME TRUE BELIEVERS- THERE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- POSSIBLY EXPANDING THAT. THAT THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL UP PUT OUT DOLLARS- FOR FRESNO IN LOS ANGELES PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL DOLLARS TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY- PLANNING AROUND HOW THEY'RE GONNA INCREASED ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS BILL GOOD JOBS INCREASE ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS AND WE WORKED WITH IS THE STRATEGIC COUNCIL TO BUILD IN THE SAME- VALUES AND PRINCIPLES. US SO THAT THE JOBS OF THE GREATER GOOD QUALITY NUMBER ONE- AND THEN THERE'S A EQUITY ANGLE IT'S VERY PRESENT THERE THAT HELPING PEOPLE FROM THE TO BEING. COMMITTEES AROUND AS THOUGH. TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS. WE'RE TALKING ALSO WILL CLIMB AGENCIES IN SACRAMENTO. THE ENERGY COMMISSION. ARE THERE RESOURCES BOARD IN OTHERS ABOUT HOW WE CAN ATTACH SIMILAR PRINCIPLES TO DOLLARS AND GO UP FROM THOSE AGENCIES- BECAUSE IT'S A PRETTY. BIG INVESTMENT THAT'S GOING OUT AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THINGS LIKE- BUILD. NEW ZERO EMISSION BUSES AND THE LIKE- SO I THINK THERE. IS HUGE POTENTIAL ACROSS THE BOARD IN SACRAMENTO. THANK YOU OF I HAVE SEVERAL OF YOU MENTIONED- THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATING- YOU KNOW FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE BUILDING TRADE. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- WHAT CAN WE DO AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO HELP WITH THOSE COLLABORATIONS AND TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU WORKING TOGETHER- SO TO HAVE BEEN. OR WHY I THINK IN THE END THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS- THE YOU'VE ALREADY INTENTIONAL- WITH SOME OF YOUR NEWER LEGISLATION AND WHEN YOU'RE SUPPORTING GETTING BACK TO- SENATOR THE CENTER'S COMMENTS ON IF THERE'S WORKFORCE DOLLARS ARE THOSE WORK FIRST DOLLARS BEING SPENT IN AN AREA WHERE THE RESULTING IN GOOD JOBS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS WRITTEN STANDARDS AND TO THE DOLLARS THAT HE IF WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT APPRENTICESHIP READINESS PROGRAM LET SUPPORT THE ONE THAT'S LOOKED AT BY THE CONTRACTORS AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT EMPLOY THE APPRENTICES IN THE INDUSTRY. AND IN OUR CASE YOU KNOW WE WILL REPRESENT OVER SIXTY THOUSAND APPRENTICES IN CALIFORNIA AND OVER 90% OF ALL APPRENTICESHIP IN CONSTRUCTION ONE WE SUPPORT OF A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT THAT INDUSTRIES LOOK FOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY DONE A GOOD JOB AT THAT- SOME OF YOUR NEWER LEGISLATION ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. HAS WRITTEN IN- STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE REGION TO INVOLVE THE WORK FORCE BOARD- YOUR LOCAL WORKSOURCE CENTER AND WHERE TO. GET OVER IT I. RIGHT FUNDING AND SUPPORT TO GET OVER BARRIERS PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL TRAINING AGENCIES THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF PARTNERING ON CURRICULUM AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT GET INTO THOSE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND THEN- ALSO LOOKING TO LABOR- YOU KNOW I'M NOT NAIVE TO THINK THAT EVERY- COUNTY IS LIKE LOS ANGELES BUT IN IT WEATHERS OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE LET'S COLLABORATE WITH THE WORK FORCE. YOU KNOW IT IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT CONSTRUCTION OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS HAS TURNED INTO A GOOD CAREER IT'S HAPPENED BY HAVING WORKER INVOLVEMENT IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING- BY THE BY THE MEMBERS AND IT CAN HAPPEN NOT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT THE KEY IS TO INVOLVE THE WORKER AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING BUT I THINK THE STATE HAS DONE A GOOD JOB ABOUT CREE THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE NEWER LEGISLATION THAT WE SEE. IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER ALL THE TIME. WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN THAT'S BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL IS WHENEVER- MANY OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PARTICULAR WHEN CALIFORNIA COMMUTE COLLEGES ARE WRITTEN INTO THE BILL TO BE AT THE TABLE TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY HELPFUL- THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE SO THAT HAS BEEN. RECENTLY A LOT OF DIFFERENT BILLS THAT WE'VE BEEN WRITTEN INTO TO PARTICIPATE AND IT REALLY HELPS SORT OF GROW THE ECO SYSTEM BECAUSE AND BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS I CAN THINK OF ONE RECENTLY. THAT HELLO HOW ARE OVER THAT SHE- CAME CAME ABOUT BUT AB FIVE SEVEN SEVEN WHERE- WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS COMMISSION WORKING WITH A CALIFORNIA COMMUNE COLLEGES TO DEVELOP THOSE. ONLINE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM AND IT BROUGHT US TO THE TABLE AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A LONG TRADITION OF PARTNERING TOGETHER SO THAT WAS VERY. IT IN AS A PERFORMER CAN CAUSE STUDENT IS GREAT TO SEE THE INVOLVEMENT COLLEGES AND WORKING. AS WE SEE THAT THE WORK WAS DOUBLE MORE WORKING WITH S. I. YOU FOR EXAMPLE THE ON THE HOME CARE WORKERS I THINK. HAS A SPREAD AROUND THE STATE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMPLETE KEY ROLE. IN TRAINING A LOT OF THESE THESE WORKERS AND PARENTS AS WELL AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP IN THE COMMISSION HEARING YESTERDAY BECAUSE- HOME CARE WORK KEEPS COMING UP BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE UNICORN FIELD AND IT'S A TOTALLY UNDERPAID AND- THERE'S SO MUCH WICKS THAT. OTHER ISSUES THAT GO ALONG WITH IT AND- ONE OF THE FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE YESTERDAY THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT WHILE WE NEED TO HAVE HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES. UP FOR THOSE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK- AND BY SUGGEST THAT MY LOOK THE MONEY. OVER MANY DECADES AS PRIVATE SECTOR'S GOT RID OF PENSIONS THERE'S A REASON WHY THERE'S SO MANY SENIORS AND POVERTY. SO I THINK THAT THERE IS AN APP THERE'S AN ASPECT OF. OF THESE CORPORATIONS STEPPING UP THAT HAVE REALLY. PUT BURDEN ON TO THE PUBLIC OF TAKING CARE OF OUR SENIORS AND I THINK THAT THAT HOW YOU CAN. HELP TO FIND. SOME OF THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS. INCREASED WAGES INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND SO I THINK. THAT IF THERE IS AN ECOSYSTEM. FUNDING PIECE IS BROKEN. HAS BEEN INTENTIONALLY KIND OF BROKEN OVER THE DECADES BUT- I THINK THAT THE COLLABORATION AND SHOWING THAT THE MODEL WORKS. WILL HELP US. BETTER GO AFTER THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND THEN ON THE LAST COMMENT I HAVE IS ON THE PROCUREMENT. I THINK ANY PROCUREMENT. OR SUBSIDY SOMETIMES CALLED INCENTIVES BUT THEIR SUBSIDIES. OF SHOULD COME WITH GOOD JOBS AND THERE SHOULD BE A THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY- AND I HAVE HAD A BILL WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AT THE WITH THE- PUBLIC THAT. THAT PULL BRING BACK AGAIN. BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL. THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT USING PUBLIC TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THAT THEY'RE CREATING QUALITY JOBS. AND SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR. FROM A NUMBER OF YOU AS WELL AS WAS BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY IN THE HEARING THAT. IT'S A THAT'S IMPORTANT PRIORITY BECAUSE I KNOW FOR EVERYBODY UP HERE- WE'RE IN AGREEMENT. SO THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH ANY OF THE LAST CONTRA QUESTION. OKAY WELL THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT- AND FOR SOME OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS. AS WELL AS WHAT WE CAN DO. TO HELP YOU. AND SO AS THE PANELS SWITCH OUT IN THIS NEXT PANEL AS A MOVE LOOKING FORWARD TO BECAUSE WE DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE ACTUAL PROGRAMS- THAT ARE LIFTING UP OF. THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY- THAT- THAT HAVE SO MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE IN OF OFTENTIMES BEEN WRITTEN OFF. AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT WERE IN THIS THIS MOMENT- AWARE. OF LEVY CAN REALLY SUPPORT- SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS I KNOW A LOT OF THEM TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CENTER COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR. SOME OF THE STORIES OF THESE AT THE ACTUAL PROGRAMS ARE ON THE GROUND. AND SO- BUT A VERY HAPPY TO HAVE WITH US. TODAY. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. I DOCTOR DOCTOR ON A LOOSE GONZALEZ OF THE UCLA LABOR CENTER. ESTERS OF THE MIGUEL CONTRAST FOUNDATION. DANIEL TOYS FROM THE FRONT RANGE CENTER AND SKIP TOWNSEND REPRESENTING SECOND CALL- EACH PANELIST WILL HAVE ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES TO SPEAK AND AGAIN WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER THAT AS WELL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF BEING HERE I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT AN IMPORTANT INITIATIVE THE HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS THAT ADVANCED EQUITY AND- JOB QUALITY FOR MY DRIVES COMMUNITIES. ASKED HIM SAID ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THE STATE CALIFORNIA WORKERS OF ON THE BOARD FUNDED EIGHT SKILL FOCUS INDUSTRY BASED PARTNERSHIPS TO CONNECT LOW WAGE AND MOST CO WORKERS TO QUALITY CAREER LADDERS. THAT INCLUDE A CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE APPROACH AND A VISION FOR EQUITY. THE PARTNERSHIPS. THIS PARTNERSHIP SPAN SECTORS VITAL TO THE CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY HEALTHCARE HOSPITALITY TRANSIT WATER AND WASTEWATER BUILDING OPERATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE THREE IMPORTANT ACTORS WORK REPRESENTATIVES EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVES AND EIGHTEEN YEAR. ON THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET ARE EMPLOYERS AND ON THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET OUR WORKERS INTERMEDIARIES RECEIVE SINGLES FROM BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE WORKER REPRESENTATIVES TO WORK WITH. WORKERS WORK FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT WILL ADDRESS BOTH THE DEMAND SIDE AND THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET. WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS IS THAT THEIR INDUSTRY DRIVEN AND WORKER CENTERED. WORKER AND EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVES ARE THE INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY SKILL SOLUTIONS TO INDUSTRY WORKFORCE NEEDS. IN OTHER WORDS YOU NEED A WORKER EXPERTISE ON THE WORK IS VALUED JUST AS HIGHLY AS EMPLOYER WORK THE PLAYER KNOWLEDGE AND HOW TO OPERATE IN THE INDUSTRY. WORKERS ARE INVALUABLE MEMBERS OF THE PARTNERSHIP THEY HELPED SHAPE TRAINING PROGRAMS AND CURRICULA THE TRAIN OTHER WORKERS AND THEY ARE AT THE CENTER OF DEVELOPING INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS. AS THE EVALUATOR VÀ HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE FOUND THAT HIGHER THE HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIP APPROACH CREATE IT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ECOSYSTEM OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. NEW AN INCUMBENT WORKERS GAIN ACCESS TO TRAINING PROGRAMS ON THE JOB MENTORING. AND CAREER PATHWAYS THAT HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE JOB IN A CHIEF ECONOMIC SECURITY. EMPLOYERS GAIN A SKILLED AND RELIABLE WORKFORCE. SECOND TRIP THAT IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND SELF IS QUALITY OF SERVICE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTRIBUTING TO INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS. THAT SECURE EMPLOYERS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. AND ALTHOUGH PARTNERSHIPS VERY UNSTRUCTURED USE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND HAVE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THEY SHARE A COMMON BROAD GOAL. TO BUILD AN ECONOMY BASED ON SKILLS INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY SUSTAINABILITY ENSURE PROSPERITY. NOW I'M GOING TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THESE PARTNERSHIPS LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND.

A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM MY NAME IS DANIEL AND FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU I SAY THAT BECAUSE MY PERSONAL LIFE HAS BEEN. ONLY IMPACTED BY THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING TO THE CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. BUT I'M FORMALLY INCARCERATED FORMER FOSTER YOUTH BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND TWENTY THREE IN NOT A CAR SERRATION AND AT TWENTY THREE I GOT NOW AND I REALIZE THAT A FORK IN THE ROAD. AND I TWO CHILDREN AT THE TIME AND I. I WAS AT A FORK IN TO ME WAS VERY THIS DATA I EITHER DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I'M GOOD. READY FOR TWENTY YEARS. I'M SORRY. SOME PROGRAM TWO DAYS AFTER GRADUATING. I BECAME LAW FOR STONE MADE. AND IT WAS A FOR SOME OF A LIFE I HAVE SEEN. ROLE MODEL AND I WAS. ENTIRE FAMILY OF MY FATHER'S A IMMIGRANT FROM NOW ON A BOTTLE AND IS JUST TO KIND OF SEE SOME OF THE STRUGGLE LITTLE DID I KNOW AT THAT TIME THAT I PLAYED A ROLE IN KIND OF. EXPAND THESE OPPORTUNITIES A STATE IT IS THAT I ENVISIONED MYSELF BUT IT'S REALLY AMAZING. THAT I'M AT I'M ACTUALLY ABLE TO BE A- WORK. THERE'S SO MANY PARTNERS IN THIS WORK AND- JUST GIVE A LITTLE. TENER NUMBER CENTER WAS A GRANT GIVING FOUNDATION FOR THE BETTER THIRTY YEARS- THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AS DECIDING TO SUNSET THE LAST BIT OF OUR FOUNDATION DOCTORS. WE WANT SAYS. THE GAPS IN SERVICES WERE. US SEVENTY. HERE KEPT COMING UP IS THAT PEOPLE COME FROM GRAYSON HAD LITTLE TO NO OUT TO. OF SERVICES FOR WOMEN OPPORTUNITIES. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS OKAY. SO THIS AND WE COULDN'T FIND ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN OUR AREA WHERE FROM PASADENA. YOU KNOW A PRETTY. A FLUENT COMMUNITY WHERE A LOT. OF PEOPLE KIND A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SO WITH RE ENTRY ALREADY AND ALL DIFFERENT IS THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE TODAY ARE KIND OF- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE. WE HAVE ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS. MONEY WELL IN THIS IN A. ONE ONE OF MY COWORKERS ALWAYS THIS IS. THE DEAN IS THE CITY OF ROSES AND ROSES ARE BEAUTIFUL. POINTS TO AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO WORK WITH. AND. WE STARTED OFF DOING. IT WAS VERY. A WELL INTENTIONED HEARTED. GOOD FOR EFFORT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. MANY CARS RATED. DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT AND. THESE ARE MY THESE ARE PHARMACIES ANSWERS OUR UNCLE. ONE OKAY WELL WAY I LIKE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT IS YOU KNOW IF MY IF MY DAUGHTER TOOK A DOLLAR OUT OF MY WALLET WITHOUT ASKING AND I FOUND OUT I WOULD TALK TO UNTIL IT WOULD AGAIN AND THAT'S THE END OF IT BUT WHAT WE DO AS A SOCIETY IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS WE CAN'T PUNISH. STEP IN EVERY SINGLE DAY. AFTER THE. THE TIME FOR WHATEVER. CRIME WHAT IS IT THAT THEY CAN. I DON'T USE THAT PERSON INCARCERATE BUT THERE WE NOW HAVE ACCESS LEAST LESS OPPORTUNITY. WROTE UPWARD MOBILITY ALL DIFFERENT THINGS I AM KIND OF CYCLE OF VIOLENCE FROM. THIS HAD NOTHING TO. NUMBER WORKFORCE US. CONSTRUCTION FROM. SOMEBODY'S BACKGROUND- QUICKLY WE FOUND OUT THAT CONSTRUCTION THE SAME. WE WERE SEVEN PEOPLE OFF TO GO NONUNION COP IS IN. BE EXPLOITED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO FOR US OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FOCUS ON WHAT IS THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE PEOPLE WERE WORKING WITH. CONTINUE TO GUIDE AND- MOVE. IT WOULD IN KEEPING THAT IN MIND. WE'RE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. NOT TO BE IS THAT. ABOUT MEANING AGES UPPER MOBILITY- PENSION RETIREMENT OF FULL HEALTH BENEFITS ALL THINGS I GOT TO EXPERIENCE ON THE FIRST HAND YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD IT FELT TO- I HAVE TO CALL MY LANDLORD AND TELLER THAT THE. YOU KNOW MY KIDS UP AND SHOW UP AT OUR HOUSE AND BACK. TO YOU MAKE THIS. THAT POINT AND. ZERO INVESTMENT THE I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME OUT OF MY POCKET AT ALL DOES IT AND BIGGER THAN THAT I CIRCLE EVERYBODY THAT WAS ATTACHED TO ME MY BROTHER. FRIENDS THAT WERE ALSO INVOLVED. NOT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE. THINGS IN THE COMMUNITY STARTED SEEING THIS CHANGE WANTED TO GET INVOLVED MOST OF THEM MOST OF MY VERY CLOSE FRIENDS ARE ALL TRADESMEN JOURNEYMEN MAKING GREAT MONEY TAKING CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES. SO THIS IMPACT. IT WOULD A CANCER IT IS IT'S REALLY A HARD THING TO FOLLOW SO WE SAW. HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH- THE LA IN ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL SUPER FRUITFUL BUT A COUPLE OF JUST WHAT WON OUT KIND OF REITERATE THE FOR. ABOUT IS OUT THEM. BOB ARE USED TO THESE UNION. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO PREPARE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND GET ON INTO THESE OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE SUPER IMPORTANT ARM. AND IT TAKES A VILLAGE. IT IS NOT THIS WERE NOT THE SPECIALIST IN AND BEING VOTE WHAT I LIKE TO THINK. LISTEN AGAIN TO FIND THIS LIST THAT ARE SPECIALIZING IN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL OR SAY WE DO IT ALL WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE PEOPLE THAT DO IT AND DO IT REALLY WELL AND HAVE THEM. OF PART OF THE TEAM THAT'S WHAT WE WANNA DO AND IT'S BEEN REALLY IMPACT ONE REALLY WELL- WE'VE TRAVELED DATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A CALIFORNIA WORK FORCE TO. BOARD IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I USE THAT LENDERS WERE THIS ANNA WE GOT THIS WE DO. BUT WHAT I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THERE'S NO ORGANIZATION. THAT TO. FRIENDSHIP IS PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT WAYS WORK. LOCATE AND POOR- WHATEVER OVER THERE CERTAIN STANCES ARE AND I AM SO MUCH. I FELT THAT I GAVE. TRAINING GROUPS AND BROUGHT PEOPLE TO BRING STUFF BACK DOWN THE PASADENA INTO A LAKE THAT REALLY IS CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE DO THIS PRE APPRENTICESHIP QUIRK. X. UPGRADE I MEAN IT IS A MODEL SHIP I WANT TO SHARE STUFF BECAUSE WE'RE DATA DATA PEOPLE. WE UNDERSTAND HOW IS IMPORTANT- SO WE HAVE THIS- SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE TRACKING EVERYBODY AND- SO THAT THE OWNER. OF THE AIRPORT OUR. ON THE INVESTED IN IN. TRAINING. WORK ON THE PROJECT. GOING ON AT LOS ANGELES WORLD AIRPORTS AND SO THE- PROGRAMS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD MAYBE A LITTLE LESS EIGHTEEN MONTHS. DUMB OUT OF THE HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT PLACE AND GOOD PAYING CAREERS WERE ABLE THE SEVEN OF THEM LOOK AT HOW MUCH THEY'VE EARNED FOR THEIR FAMILIES- OUT OF THE EIGHTY SEVEN PEOPLE. THEY WORKED A TOTAL OF EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND HOURS ON LOS ANGELES WORLD AIRPORTS THEY'VE EARNED TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. ON SO THINK ABOUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO SET THE SYSTEM UP. THE MODEL IS THERE ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAY THE CAPITOL BUILDINGS THAT SAM WAS TALKING ABOUT OR WHATEVER IS GOING ON THE SACRAMENTO. THE SYSTEMS EXIST AND EVEN FURTHER MORE WERE ABLE TO TRACK HOW MANY WOMEN ARE WORKING WHICH FOR THIS PROJECT IT'S 13% WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD CONSTRUCTION- INDUSTRY WHICH IS LIKE 223% AFRICAN AMERICANS- IS THE STANDARD BUILDING TRADES- LATINOS IS ABOUT 35% FIVE OR 6% CAUCASIAN- BUT WERE ABLE TO SEE EVEN. EVEN BASED BY RACE AND GENDER WHAT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE BRINGING BACK TO THE- TO THEIR COMMUNITY NOW ALL THESE PEOPLE LIVE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY THEY'RE PAYING TAXES WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY THEY'RE BUYING GAS. SB ONE SHADOW THANK YOU FOR SB ONE YEAH THIS I MEAN THIS GOOD STUFF GOOD STUFF GOING ON THERE BUT THEY BY GAS THERE SO I MEAN IF WE START LOOKING AT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR WHAT WE'RE- INVESTING AT THE STATE LEVEL INTO THESE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREER PARTNERSHIPS. WE COULD REALLY SEE THAT IT'S A GOOD THING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU WELL FIRST OFF THANKS FOR SAYING SOMETHING NICE FOR THE GAS TAX. REFRESHING. AND YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOBODY MINIMAL DORIAN WAS TALKING ABOUT DANIEL ABOUT BREAKING THAT CYCLE AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE INVEST IN PEOPLE WITHOUT JUDGEMENT. AND KNOW THAT UP AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR POTENTIAL MEANS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR YOUR STORY YOU'RE A WONDERFUL SPOKESPERSON FOR WHY WE NEED TO INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS- AND THEN FINALLY SKIP TOWNSEND. YES INDEED THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. MY STORY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT- I ACTUALLY HAD A CAREER I WAS DOING GREAT AND I WANTED TO STOP THE VIOLENCE IN MY COMMUNITY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IDEA IT IS- SAID WELL I BECAME A COMMERCE OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS BECAUSE I DISCOVERED SOMETHING A FATHER GREG BOYLE WAS ALREADY DOING. WHICH IS GETTING PEOPLE JOBS- BUT AS DORIAN SAID IT IS NOT JUST OVER BROKE IT WAS A JOURNEY OF THE BROKE SO I WAS HELPING PEOPLE GET IN THE JOBS BUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING IS THEY WERE SHOWING UP LATE. THEY WERE SHOWN UP HIGH THEY WERE SHOWING UP DRUNK THEY WORK ONE WE CAN QUIT AND I WAS FINE IN THAT- A LOT OF EMPLOYERS WILL CALL ME BACK SAYING HEY WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE YOUR PEOPLE SO. DON'T BRING THEM- THAT WAS UNTIL I DISCOVERED THAT I NEEDED TO USE WORKSOURCE CENTERS I NEEDED TO USE. SOME OF THE PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM- UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A JOB AND HOW TO KEEP IT. SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS USE MY OWN VAN- AND FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NO FIND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX DARTED SECOND CALL I WOULD TAKE MY OWN VAN AND GATHER ALL THE DRIVE BY SHOOTERS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY AND TAKEN TO THE WORKSOURCE CENTERS AND- TEACH THEM HOW TO GET A JOB AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THEY WOULD COME BACK ON THE BLOCK IN A- TIE ON. AND HAVE A RESUME ROLLED UP IN THEIR BACK POCKET BUT THEY WERE STILL SMOKIN AND DRINKIN AND DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT THEY WERE DOING THEY JUST KNOW HOW TO RESUME IN A TIME ON. I'M SORRY I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A- BAD INFLUENCE AS MUCH AS I WANTED THEM DATING ONE FOR THEMSELVES. I MET A GUY NAMED JOHN AREA- WHO IS THAT TIME THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE- POLITICAL UNIONS- THIRTY IT JUST BECAME A FULL TIME AND- HE WAS EXPRESSING THE ME THEY DO HAVE A GREAT COMPONENT. WITH THE CURRICULUM WITH YES I RECOMMEND HE HAD. TO SAY AND STOP DO THE WORK. SO I COULD NOT IDENTIFY. NOT WHAT THE INDIVIDUALS A RUN INTO BUT HELP THEM IDENTIFY WHAT THEY WERE RUNNING FROM. AND THAT'S WHEN WE GOT THE UNRESOLVED IN VICARIOUS TRAUMA. SO FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND- LET ME GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO AND- A PRAYER FOR EVERYONE IN SAUGUS FROM YESTERDAY- IN SANTA CLARITA. BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO IS THE NEXT PERSON TO WANT TO HURT SOMEONE. SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS GIVE THEM AN EMOTIONALLY SAFE PLACE. TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH ANGER HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH EMOTIONS ON THE DEAL WITH LOW SELF ESTEEM. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH TRAUMA. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT- THE TRAUMA- THERE'S PTSD IN THE COMMUNITY. AND LET ME JUST SAY AS A LIFETIME RESIDENT OF SOUTH CENTRAL. THERE IS NO PTSD AND THAT COMMUNITY- BECAUSE IT'S NOT POLLS IS CONSTANTLY REOCCURRING. THAT MAKES IT PRESENT. STRESS PRESENT TRAUMA THAT STILL IN THE COMMUNITY. AND A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LEARNED HOW TO- WANNA SAY SELF MEDICATE WHETHER IT'S BY USE OF DRUGS WHETHER IT'S BY- ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER FORM- THEY CHOOSE TO RUN TO. BUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FOR ME. IS HOW DO I HELP THEM. WITH THE HEALING PROCESS. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE AND SECOND CALL IS YEAH WE'RE CONNECTED TO- AND AT THIS TIME- JOHN IS. A WHAT IS HE'S A SUPERINTENDENT A REGIONAL SUPERINTENDENT FOR MORE MEDALS AND- BUT IN CHARGE OF DIVERSION AN INCLUSION FOR HIS COMPANY. SO AS A SUPERINTENDENT BUT WE HAVE OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME TO OUR PROGRAM NOW WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. CORE IN A POSITION OF POWER. WE FOR OPENS GENERAL. FOREMAN'S AND SUPERINTENDENT WHO ARE ARE. ACTIVISTS ILLUSTRATORS WHO COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE NOT I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST AN APPRENTICE BUT THEY'RE NOT A FRIEND IS. THERE NOT JUST JOURNEYMEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN SAY LOOK I CAN HELP YOU GET INTO THE CAREER I CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU GET ON MY JOB. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE CLASSES THAT WE FACILITATE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE- AND YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH I'M I'M INSIDE THE PRISONS AND WORK IN THE PRISONS. WHERE INDIVIDUAL SAYS I NEED TO LEARN A TRADE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO WANT TO HELP THEM LEARN A TRADE BUT FIRST ONE ON ONE HELP THEM DO IS BECOME A BETTER PERSON. BECAUSE AYE AYE HER CHRIS SAYING THAT- CHRISTIAN CHRISTIAN AND SAYING THAT WE WERE INTRODUCED THEM TO THE MC THREE CURRICULUM. SO ALL THE TRADES RIGHT SO THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE BECAUSE BECOME A SECOND CALLING ON TRY TO MAKE YOU A ELECTRICITY NOT JUST A- THAT NOW BUT- YOU KNOW WE DO. DEAL WITH THE CARPENTERS AND SHEET METAL AND WE HAVE OTHERS PARTNERS AS WELL. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS. I DON'T CARE WHAT. PATHWAY THEY CHOOSE AS FAR AS CONSTRUCTION AND I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT- CHILDCARE DEVELOPMENT AND THINGS OF THIS NATURE. BUT HOW CAN WE MAKE THEM A BETTER PERSON NOT JUST SO THEY WHEN THEY GO OUT ON THE WORK SITE. BUT ALSO WHEN I GO HOME AT NIGHT AS DANIEL SAID WITH THEIR FAMILIES. HOW CAN WE HELP THEM- CHANGE THE DIRECTION THAT THE FAMILY IS GOING IN. AND I THINK THAT WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE TO TIM SAID. EARLIER ABOUT THE- GUY SAID HIS SON IS NOW PUT ON HIS HARD HAT AND BOOTS. BECAUSE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS PICKING UP A GUN. THAT HIS SON EVENTUALLY WILL BE PICKING UP A GUN AS WELL. SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS JUST HELP THE FAMILY BECOME WHOLE AGAIN. AND HELP THEM WITH THE PROCESS OF HEALING SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO WORK AT LA ACTS- SO THEY CAN GO TO WORK IT AROUND STADIUM OR ANYONE THESE PROJECTS. SO I THINK PARTNERSHIP IS GREAT AND I'M TRULY GRATEFUL TO BE ONE OF THE PARTNERS WITH THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SKIP FOR A- TWO YEAR COMMITMENT FOR GIVING EVERYTHING UP TO LIFT UP YOUR COMMUNITY- IT'S A QUITE INSPIRING AND- BEFORE I BRING IT BACK I WAS WANT TO GIVE ALL OF UKIAH THIRTY SECOND LIGHTNING ROUND. OF WHAT YOU WOULD WANT US TO COULD BE BUDGET MAYBE THERE'S SOME REGULATION THAT'S- KEEPING YOU FROM HELPING SOME YOUR CLIENTS WHAT HAVE YOU- WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT IS CONSTANTLY. IF NOT THAT'S FINE OR IF IT COULD REPEAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER. THAT'S FINE TOO. MANY THINGS ANYTHING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. COULD DO BUDGET. MY TO HELP. FEEL FREE. OF OUR ORDER ANYWAY I'LL START THAT YOU KNOW FOR MOST OF THE PROGRAMS I HEAR ABOUT. THE GRAY AREA IS THAT AREA THAT I JUST ADDRESS. THE GRAY AREA IS THE- GETTING THE HEALTHY PEOPLE WHEN I AND I LOVE- LOLA AND ALL THE PEOPLE WITH THE BLACK WORKERS CENTER. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SEE AS WELL IS- WE DON'T SEE PEOPLE OF OUR COLOR OUT THERE SO. AS DANIEL SAID LA X. HAS 55% WHICH IS HIGHER THAN. MOST ANY OTHER COMPANIES- BUT THE GRAY AREAS GETTING HEALTHY BLACK PEOPLE I DON'T WANT TO GET BLACK PEOPLE ON THE WORK SITE. JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AS WE HAVE TO HIRE FROM THIS. I WANT TO GET THE HEALTHY ONES OUT THERE. THE HEALTHY ONES WHO WON'T AS WE CALL IT EMBARRASSES. AND THIS IS A GRAY AREA SO I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TO INVEST MORE. IN THIS AREA. OKAY IN ALL OF ITS A SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT HE'LL SOME OF THE FIRST OF THAT YOU CAN BE PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN THOSE PROGRAMS. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENT ON YOUTH IN ENGLISH ALLOWED DURING THOUGHT. PLEASE SO YOU KNOW WE CAN GET UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IT'S MOST IMPACTFUL TO HEAR FROM. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN THROUGH THE PROGRAM. NOT A GERMAN HERE TODAY MISTER SAM OKAY AS A GRADUATE OF OUR- OUR- SEVEN COHORT. AND I YOU KNOW I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO FOR HIM TO SHARE YOU KNOW HIS EXPERIENCE WITH. ALL WORK AND NO ALL HIS YOU KNOW. CAREER AS- LABOR. SO IN A FEW IN FEEL. WILL GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE UP PUBLIC COMMENT WILL HAVING HIM GO FIRST- BUT THAT IT JUST IN A IN IN A HANDFUL OF MINUTES WE'LL GET TO THAT- GAS ACTUALLY I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING- BUT THAT JOURNEY. ANYTHING ELSE- I FOR ME- I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO PITCH OR- A BUT I HAVE A VALUE WAITED HIGHER TWENTY PARTNERSHIPS. AND WHAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT LIGHTNING IS. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO FUND. ORGANIZATIONS TO THIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE SYSTEM CHANGE. AND. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO THEN FUNDING. ORGANIZATIONS. MAYBE CALL OUTSIDE OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM LIKE WORKER CENTERS IN DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. I THINK IT'S REALLY PART TO HAVE THAT THAT INTERMEDIARY TO THEN. DEVELOP PROGRAMS IDENTIFY SPECIAL IF YOU KNOW SPECIAL- OR COMPREHENSIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS- AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FUNDING WILLIAM. I THINK THINGS. AND. WE DEFINE WHICH IS STRICTLY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- THAT COULD I ALSO SUPPORTING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND DANIEL YEAH FOR ME I GOT TOO MUCH ON. INDUSTRY EVEN IF WE BRING IT UP TODAY BUT- YEAH DEFINITELY FUNDING FOR COMMITTEE BUT HONEST THIS AND WE'RE EVER GONNA OF BRING THESE PART HAS BEEN FROM LIKE A GOOD IN EIGHT THE END OF COMMUNITIES OR- SINCE. HIS HONEST. LEVELS OF TAPE ARE MUCH. SOME OF THE REGULATIONS AROUND THAT MIGHT BE. IN PLACE FOR A COURSE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. COOKING FOR THE COMPANY BASED ORGANIZATION HAVE BECAUSE IT'S JUST PURE MUST. AND IT JUST IT THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND THAT- ALSO I LOVE TO SEE MORE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS- ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT HELP US. THESE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION. CAREER PROGRAMS INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION COM. WELL THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH AND- I LOVE THE CONNECTION THAT YOU'RE MAKING BE. SUPPORTED SERVER IS AND ALSO CAREERS NOT JUST A JOB FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN. TRY TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE JUST LIKE ROLLING AROUND. AND SO THE CONNECTION TO CAREERS OF THE CONNECTION TO THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED- AND FRAZIER LEE. OR THE THIRD COLLECTED. A RELATIONSHIP IS SO IMPORTANT BACK TOWARD THE UP CHRIS. THIS IS BEING INVESTED BY PRIVATE EMPLOYERS INTO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT'S A HUGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S AN ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT THAT MUCH MONEY IS BEING NEGOTIATED IF IT WASN'T FOR THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WILL NOT BE GOING INTO OUR CUT THESE TO HELP A. AND YOU WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THOSE KIND OF CONNECTIONS AND- BROTHER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CABIN HEALTHY. INDEED GOING PROGRAM APPRECIATE. OTHER WAYS WE SORT OF SET UP PEOPLE FAILURE OF AND THAT NOT RIGHT EITHER THEY SHOULD. CHANGE. I'VE SEEN OF I CAME OUT OF THE HOSPITAL THE INDUSTRY AND THAT WARY AT TODAY IS WHERE A LOT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES CAN BECOME. AND A LIKE A PRINCE MAY BE WHAT IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WARRANT IS PROGRAM IN THE IN THE. TRADES THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES TODAY ONE. HOSPITALITY. PLEASE SET UP IN IT WE SHOULD ALLIES WITH EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OF. THERE IS SUCH A WAY THAT. PEOPLE SEE THEMSELVES WITH THE REAL FUTURE NOT ONLY. I'M GONNA GO. THAT UP BUT I'M GETTING RAIN FOR IT AND THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING I'M GETTING TWENTY DOLLARS AN HOUR PLUS HEALTH PLUS PENSION MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT MOTIVATES YOU TO THEIR WANTED TO OTHER OTHER THINGS- AND IN THE CAREER LADDER SO I GUESS NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION OF I DO. THE MORE SPECIFIC THAT YOU COULD GET ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO AS LEGISLATORS REALLY SPECIFIC- OR TWO OR THREE REALLY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE COULD DO AS A TEAM- I REALLY ASK YOU WHETHER YOU. YOU HAVE A RIGHT NOW OR NOT GET IT TO US BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE YOU SUCCEED AND EXPAND EVEN MORE. YEAH EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU HEARD FROM THE FIRST PANEL. JOIN TOGETHER IN THAT ASK RIGHT THE MORE THE CURE THAT COMES TOGETHER- WHETHER IT'S ACCOUNTABILITY IN PROCUREMENT OR CONTRACTING OUT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. THAT CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF YOU TO CONTINUE WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT TO GROW IT AND TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE. SERVICE. SENATOR I PLACE SENATE. OKAY FIRST- IT WAS GREAT HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU AND SHARING YOUR STORIES AND- SUCCESSES FROM THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE CREATED I THINK IT'S VERY ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT HERE- FROM THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE WORKING ON THE GROUND IN. DAY TO DAY- IN THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS- ONE OF THE THINGS I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IS SO I REPRESENT THE NORTHEAST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH INCLUDES POINT MONSON VALLEY'S SO- NORTHERN CITY LIMITS A VALET. AND I FIND THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS BASED OUT THERE AND MY CONSTITUENTS IT'S WE HAVE A HIGH NEED- IN MY COMMUNITY FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND- TRANSPORTATION IS A BARRIER IN A LOT OF TIMES GOING TO COMMERCE. OR DOWNTOWN LA OR SOUTH LA IS WOULD TAKE TWO HOURS OR MORE IN A ON. TO GET THERE- AND SO ONE OF MY INTEREST. IS TO BRING PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND TO WORK WITH EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS- THAT THAT LIKE ONE OF YOU SAID. THAT WE MAY NOT THINK UP AS WORK FORCE TO. THAT OF GRANT PROGRAMS IF THEY'RE PUT OUT SAY FOR THE STATE FUNDING- THEY'D SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FILL OUT THE APPLICATION. HE LOOKED AND WE NEED TO CREATE A SYSTEM OR A SOME- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RATES OF THAT- COMMUNITIES THERE IN HIGH NEED- GET THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO APPLY AND TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY. WITH THE STATE FUNDING OR FEDERAL OR OTHER- FUNDING SOURCES THAT MAY HAVE LIKE A LOT OF RED TAPE LIKE YOU SAID RATE. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A SMALLER ORGANIZATION THAT YOU'RE STRAIN IS THE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AND YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WE REALLY NEED AND I KNOW SKIP AND OTHERS YOU BROUGHT THOSE. AIM POINTS UP BUT THEN THE GRANT WRITING THEN THE COMPLIANCE- IS ANOTHER SET OF SKILLS THAT I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON RIGHT LAKE AND THAT'S ONE OF MY INTEREST TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND HOW AS A STATE LEGISLATOR I CAN HELP BECAUSE OF I. HOPE COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY OTHER STATE WIDE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME ISSUE AND- AND SO I'VE STARTED SOME DISCUSSIONS BUT- YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU OF ANY IDEAS OR WHAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR YOU IF. FOR IF YOU EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHERS HAVE GONE THROUGH SIMILAR CHALLENGES. THAT IS EXCELLENT BECAUSE- BEFORE NINE YEARS SECOND CALL WAS ALL VOLUNTARY I ACTUALLY WORKED FOR THE GREAT OFFICE I WORK FOR THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AS A GANG INTERVENTION IS AS WE CREATED SECOND CALL FOR NINE YEARS. ABSOLUTELY NO FUN AT ALL- JUST RECENTLY JANICE HAHN I SAW HER AT A- AN EVENT IN LONG BEACH ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO AND- SHE KNOWS WHO I AM FROM WHEN SHE WAS CITY COUNCIL. AND SHE TOLD ME TO GET IN TOUCH WITH OUR FIELD REP BECAUSE THEY HAVE MONEY FOR WHAT WE DO. AND BUT I HAD A PAROLEES WHO DONE SEVENTEEN YEARS IN PRISON I JUST WANT MY PAROLE LEAD TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH JANICE ON SO I HEARD JANICE BUT I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS JANICE HAD HER FIELD REP LOOK FOR ME PEOPLE STARTED CALL IN LIKE HEY- HER LINDA IS LOOKING FOR YOU AND SHE BROUGHT ME IN AND INNER DO SMITA DANA GARCETTI WHICH IS. BIG SISTER. AND THEY KNEW THAT THE COMMUNITY I'M WORKING WITH THE PAROLEES AND THEY DID IT THEY HELPED ME WITH ONLY ARE AND HELP ME GET A CONTRACT WITH PROBATION BECAUSE THEY KNEW I DID NOT KNOW THE PROCESS- SO. IF I COULD SAY THAT I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO JENNIFER ON BECAUSE SHE HAD- PEOPLE CHASE ME TO GET ME MONEY TO WHERE I AM. NOW WORK FOR THE CITY OF LA. I WORK FOR SECOND CALL FULL SCALE- I THINK THAT'S IT- AT AND WE'VE HAD SO MUCH HELP FROM THE FLAT RATE CENTER HAVE TAKE MY HAT OFF TO JAY LANE MOSTLY AS WELL. BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO POLICY OFFICE.

MY COMMENT JUST SPECIFIC PLEASE I THINK TO SERVICES NOTHING FERNANDO VALLEY I USED TO- UNTIL RECENTLY TEACH AT THE PAROLE OFFICE IN VAN NUYS- BUT WHERE I SPENT. MOST OF MY DAYS SORT OF GETTING PEOPLE CONNECTED TO PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TALKING ABOUT THEM. GETTING THEM SCHOOL READY SO THEY COULD APPLY FOR THEM- CDC ARE CUT THOSE PROGRAMS COMPLETELY SO THERE'S NO MORE LITERACY LAPSE IN ANY OF THE PRO OFFICES- INTENSIVE LEGISLATORS HERE I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON YOUR RADAR WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM. WELL IT USED TO BE. LET LAB. AND LIKE A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM. AND BY CONTRAST COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THEY CANCEL THAT CONTRACT SO NOW WITH NO PAROLE OFFICES IN THE STATE HAVE A LITERACY OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM AND HOUSE OBVIOUSLY. PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISON ARE GOING TO PAROLE SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS THAT SHOULD HAVE- SERVICES THAT WILL CONNECT HIM TO THESE PROGRAMS THEY DON'T ANYMORE. IN MY OTHER QUESTION WAS JUST ABOUT WHERE DO YOU HOW MUCH THOUGHT IS GIVEN TO WHEN THE TIMES ARE OVER- AND THERE'S NOT SO MUCH DEMAND FOR CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN. HOW MUCH OF THE TRAINING IS PREPARING PEOPLE TO BE NIMBLE AND- THE MOVE INTO OTHER POSITIONS WHEN. CONSTRUCTION JOBS AREN'T PLENTIFUL. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT SOME OF WHAT'S COME UP- BUT WE TALK ABOUT HOME CARE AIDES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT WE SEE IS GROWTH INDUSTRIES YESTERDAY IN THE COMMISSION HEARING- WE LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GROWTH INDUSTRIES AND HEALTHCARE- HOME CARE CHILD CARE- THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY UNDERPAID A LOT OF WASTE OF FULL OF THE AND A LOT OF A WOMEN IN THOSE POSITIONS CERTAINLY FAR MORE THAN YOU SEE IN THE- CONSTRUCTION TRADES BUT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT. THAT WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE HAVE TO BE DIVERSE IN THE KINDS OF TRAINS WE DO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF ON A IF YOU HAVE ANY. FURTHER IS THE INSIDE IN THAT IN TERMS OF TRAINING BEYOND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR BUILDING TRADES AND BUT FOR THE CONDOM IS GO UP AND DOWN WITH THAT OFTENTIMES CONSTRUCTION JOBS GO UP AND DOWN SO- IF YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO THE FROM THE LABOR CENTERS PERSPECTIVE OF CERTAIN FIELDS THAT. YOU CAN CONTINUE TO IN. ADDITION TO THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES FOCUS ON AS WELL. I KNOW THE HOSPITALITY TRAINING ACADEMY THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA MORE FOR DEVELOPMENT. PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE IS CREATING A RECALL SYSTEM FOR HOME CARE- A HOME OF ATTENDANCE THAT WILL KEEP THEM YOU'RE WORKING YOU'RE AROUND SO THE WORKING WITH OTHER OR WITH OTHER- EMPLOYERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM WORK YEAR ROUND SO THERE'S PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE. TESTING DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. THANK YOU YEAH BUT I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT THAT WE DO- AND I THINK THAT AS A SENATOR INDICATE EARLIER NO SOME. SAUCE MISSION AS WELL THE BUILDING TRADES MODEL. TO SHIP MODEL- NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED AND UNDER THE INDUSTRY'S HOTEL INDUSTRIES CHILD CARE I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO CREATE A BASELINE OF STABILITY OF EMPLOYMENT. AND SUCH IN THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE SHOWN US THE TEMPLATE- WHEN YOU'RE NOT ONLY EXPAND. THOSE BUILDING TRADES PROFESSIONS OPPORTUNITIES BUT USE THAT TEMPLATE. FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES TO EMPOWER THOSE WORKERS AS WELL. YES PLEASE.
