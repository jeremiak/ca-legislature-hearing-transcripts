RIGHT SO WE WILL NOW BEGIN WITH THEIR FIRST BILL WHICH IS I NUMBER ONE SB SIXTY FIVE BY SKI WELCOME CENTER SKINNER- YOU YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU SO MUCH- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE VERY PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SIXTY FIVE WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S MOM TO THIS BILL- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE PRESS. ABOUT THE CONGRESSIONAL BILL CALLED THE MOMENT OF THIS ACT WHICH A NUMBER OF CONGRESS MEMBERS HAVE INTRODUCED. TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT. THE INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE IS HIGHER IN. THE US THEN ALL G. EIGHT COUNTRIES SEVEN YOU KNOW U. S. IS ONE OF THE G. COUNTRIES THAT MEANS WE ARE THE HIGHEST. IN TERMS OF- ECONOMIC OUTPUT OF ANY COUNTRIES. AND SUPPOSEDLY EDUCATIONAL LEVELS AND OTHER THINGS. AND ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES IN BIRTHING. AND IN INFANCY. THEN THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF THESE DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE NOW ADDITIONALLY. THESE NUMBERS ARE SKEWED EVEN FURTHER WHEN YOU LOOK ACT PREGNANT. MOTHERS OF COLOR AN INFERENCE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY BLACK BLACK MOTHERS ARE THREE TO FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE DUE TO PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH CAUSES. THAN WHITE MOTHERS DAY ON TO BLACK BABIES ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN INFANCY THESE STATS ARE INDEPENDENT OF A BLACK MOTHERS INCOME OR EDUCATION LEVELS AND WE CAN TURN TO SERENA WILLIAMS AND BEYONCE SAY AS TWO GREAT EXAMPLES OF THIS. AND WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS INDICATED IS THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS RACIAL. SYSTEMATIC RACIAL FACTORS IN SOCIAL ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. SB SIXTY FIVE SPECIFICALLY BUILDS ON LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR MITCHELL AND- INTRODUCING WE PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW THAT ESTABLISHED AN IMPLICIT BIAS PROGRAM FOR PERINATAL CARE PROVIDERS IN SB SIXTY FIVE TAKES IT A LITTLE FURTHER. BY ESTABLISHING AND CODIFYING THE PREGNANCY MORTALITY REVIEW BOARD. INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS ON THE EXPERTISE OF THE BOARD% MEMBERS. SB SIXTY FIVE ALSO ALLOWS. A BIRTHING PEOPLE TO STAY ON MEDICAID UP TO A YEAR AFTER BIRTH AND IT EXTENDS CAL WORKS BENEFITS TO LOW INCOME PREGNANT WITH HIGHER MONTHLY STEINMAN STIPENDS AND IT MAKES WHAT IS WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE TERM CAL WORKS WE KNOW THAT PART OF THE REQUIREMENT IS A WORK REQUIREMENT. BUT IT MAKES THE WORKING OPTIONAL WHILE PREGNANT FINALLY IT- IT HAS MEDIC CAL EXPANDING WHAT SERVICES IT WOULD COVER INCLUDING DO LIKE HERE. BECAUSE WE- HAVE IN THE RESEARCH THAT THE PROVISION OF DOULAS TO A PREGNANT PERSON IS GREATLY ENHANCES THEIR- BOTH THE INFANT. BLESSED INFANT MORTALITY IN BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THE PREGNANT PERSON.

I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA TAKES GREAT PRIDE WITH ITS CRAP PLEASE. COURSE CRABBING IS THE OLDEST COMMERCIAL FISHERY IN CALIFORNIA. CATFISH MEN WORK INCREDIBLY HARD THEIR WORK HELPS PROP UP OUR RURAL COASTAL ECONOMIES AND THEY PUT WORLD RENOWNED HEALTHY FRESH SEAFOOD. ON OUR DINNER PLATES EACH AND EVERY YEAR- END SENATOR ROTH IT'S ONE OF HIS FAVORITES. THESE FISHERMEN RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY DOING THE JOBS- IN THE DANGEROUS AND EVEN LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. IT IS TIME TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON SAFETY. CODE CONSISTENCY FLEXIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY WHICH THIS BILL WOULD DO. SB EIGHTY IS THE JOINT COMMITTEES ON AND ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE ANGEL ON THE THIS BILL. RIGHT TO REMEDY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES LARGE AND SMALL RELATED TO CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE INDUSTRIES HERE ARE THE SPECIFICS ON WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO NUMBER ONE. EIGHT IT ADDRESSES VARIOUS ISSUES REGARDING EXCEEDING CRAB SEASON PRESO PERIODS TO ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS FOR FISHERMEN- AND IT ALSO BRINGS CONSISTENCY TO CODE. IT ALLOWS FOR CRAB AND THE SERRATION. CRAB GETTING OPTIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE MALL GAS IT. IT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO COLLECT BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES FROM COMMERCIAL FISHERIES AND PROCESSING FACILITIES WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT FACILITATES TRAVEL BY ALLOWING FOR TISHMAN TO TRANSIT IN CLOSED OR DELAYS AREAS PROVIDED THEY USE ELECTRONIC MONITORING OUT ON THE OCEAN. IT STREAMLINES THE TRANSFER PROCESS OF THE DUNGENESS CRAB VESSEL PERMIT UPON THE SALE. ENDED THE PRICE A FAIR START WIN THE CRAB SEASON STARTS. TO PLAY A PRICE PLY SEVERE START TO DELAYS ASSOCIATED. WITH THE RISK. ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF MARINE LIFE INTEGUMENT AND FOR CONSISTENCY ESPECIALLY FOCUS ON WALES. NEARLY ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND MEMBERS IT COMMITTEE CAME FROM US. FROM THE DUNGEON IS. TASK FORCE. THIS TASK FOR IS LED. MAN TO BE AN ADVISER BODY OR CLEARING HOUSE TASKS REVIEWING AND EVALUATING THE CRAB FISHERY MANAGEMENT MEASURES IN PROVIDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD WILDLIFE THE JOINT COMMITTEE N FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE AND THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE CONNERY I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. SPEAKING SUPPORT THEM SB EIGHTY BUT THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY OF COMMERCIAL FISHING VESSELS AND KRILOGY BY ALLOWING. THE ENGINE IS CRAFTED FROM TO SET THEIR GEAR SIXTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE FISHING SEASON. IT WOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEAFOOD SUPPLY CHAIN BY ALLOWING OUR STATE AGENCIES TO PURSUE AN ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM PRODUCTION THIS CRAB IN THE VENDOR DIMOCK ACCIDENTS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE KEEP THE POLICE TIED TO THE DOCTOR. AND DEPRIVE DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THE DECRYPTED STRING WHICH IS OFTEN THE STATE'S MOST. VALUABLE FISHERY. AS YOU KNOW IN A TO THE- FISHERMAN'S. IN RESPONSE TO THE COVER NINETEEN AND THEN THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY OF OUR STATE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SIGNATURE ACT. AND HARDSHIP OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WHAT THE LOSS OF MOBILE FISHING VESSEL TO LIVE ON THE WEST COAST IN RECENT YEARS. TAKING ACTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE SAFETY. IS PARAMOUNT. BUT INCREASE PRESO AREA FOR THE D. CRABTREE IN THE CENTRAL COAST REGION CALIFORNIA WILL ENSURE THAT FISHERMEN ARE PART OF THE FLEXIBILTY. TO DEPLOY THEIR PITCHING IN RESPONSE TO A VARIABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS. THIS INCREASE FLEXIBILITY WILL IMPROVE SAFETY. AND EVEN SAVE LIVES. SB EIGHTY PROVIDES SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN VETTED AND RECOMMENDED TO US.

HE WANTED TO THREE DESK YES THANK YOU. IT IS AGAIN. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES- AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING- THE CHAIR AND- THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US MEANS BILL. AND HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED ON PAGE SIX OF ANALYSIS. ARE CALLING SENATE BILL FIVE NINETEEN. DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE. VARIOUS. PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES. INSIDE BEEN- SERVICEMEN INDIA MAY LST IN GMC MASKELYNE AND I'VE GAINED A LIMITED TO PEOPLE AGES TWENTY ONE AND OLDER. HI IN ADDITION TO ENCOURAGE CITY FOR USE AND REDUCE HARM THE BILL ALSO DECRIMINALIZE IS. DRUG TESTING KITS AND PERMITS THE POSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA TO USE THE PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES SB FIVE NINETEEN WILL ALSO CONVENE AN EXPERT WORKING GROUP UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- TASKED WITH DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE REGULATION REGULATION OF LEGAL ACCESS TO THESE SUBSTANCES IN A MANNER THAT CITY RESPONSIBLE AND EQUITABLE. THIS LEGISLATION IS COSPONSORED BY TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT. HELP AND WORK WITH COMBAT VETERANS. TO HELP THEM ACCESS SIGNALED TREATMENT. FOR PTSD DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHERE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. THROUGH THE VA WITH OTHER TREATMENTS. OUR COLORS THIS LEGISLATION- IS ONE STEP MOVING AWAY FROM THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS. THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS BEEN ABJECT FAILURE. BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE FALSE BELIEF THE FALSE NOTION THAT CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE ARRESTING- INCARCERATING THEM FOR POSSESSING FOR USING DRUGS- WILL SOMEHOW DETER USE THAT IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY IT HAS DONE NEITHER I AND SAID WE HAVE SPEND TRILLIONS IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY ON THE WAR ON DRUGS. MORE PEOPLE ARE USING DRUGS NOW- THERE'S MORE ADDICTION THERE ARE MORE- OVERDOSES SOME TALKING ABOUT DRUGS AND GENERALLY NOT. PSYCHEDELICS AND- BUT WE HAVE BUSTED TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE HEALTH BASED APPROACH I AM BRINGING SB FIVE NINETEEN BEFORE YOU TODAY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR RESPONSE TO SUBSTANCE USE AND BECAUSE THESE PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES ARE ALREADY BEING USED TODAY BY CALIFORNIANS FOR THEIR HEALING POTENTIAL- AND MICHAEL AND OTHERWISE THEY'RE BEING USED TODAY I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT DECRIMINALIZATION AND THEY THINK IT'S GOING TO SOMEHOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TO USE STRUCTURE INCREASE DRUG USE OR MAKE DRUGS MORE ATTRACTIVE- THAT IS NOT TRUE- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE. FOR THAT- WE KNOW THAT BANNING AND CRIMINALIZING AND TAKING A CARCERAL APPROACH TO DRUGS PEOPLE STILL USE THAT THEY STILL USE IT A LOT I SAW THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY. WHATEVER ONE'S VIEWS. AB THIS ABOUT SITE- THIS ABOUT DRUGS. THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED TO ARREST AND INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR POSSESSING AND USING THESE DRUGS- WHATEVER ONE THINKS OF A PARTICULAR SUBSTANTIVE IF YOU LIKE IT OR DON'T LIKE IT OR- OR THINK IT'S A PROBLEM OR NOT A PROBLEM. THAT'S THE QUESTION SHOULD WE BE ARRESTING AND INCARCERATING PEOPLE FOR HAVING FOR POSSESSING DRUGS THIS BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE SELLING. IT'S ABOUT POSSESSION AND USE. AND SO IT'S TIME TO BRING THIS YEAR'S INTO THE LIGHT SO WE CAN HAVE A MORE SENSIBLE CONVERSATION ABOUT C. FOR USE. OF THE PSYCHEDELICS AND DISPEL MYTHS. ABOUT DECRIMINALIZATION IN RECENT YEARS AND WE AND CALIFORNIA IS NOT- WE'RE NOT THE FIRST YEAR. IN RECENT YEARS VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVING KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CREW THAT CRIMINALIZATION- DOES NOT WORK IN MANY CITIES INCLUDING SANTA CRUZ IN OAKLAND- AS WELL AS WASHINGTON DC IN SOMERVILLE MASSACHUSETTS. OF ALL MOVE TOWARDS DECRIMINALIZATION OF PSYCHEDELICS THIS PAST NOVEMBER OREGON VOTERS PASSED TWO BALLOT MEASURES WIND DECRIMINALIZED POSSESSION OF A HUGE SWATH OF DRUGS GOING WELL WELL WELL BEYOND PSYCHEDELICS. AND THEN A SEPARATE MEASURE AUTHORIZED A MOVE TOWARDS- PSILOCYBIN ASSISTED THERAPY PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE PORTUGAL HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DECRIMINALIZED THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE OF ALL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. WHILE OPPONENTS TO DECRIMINALIZATION AT THE TIME ARGUED THAT PORTUGAL'S APPROACH WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH DRUG OVERDOSES IN H. I. R. THE WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS A DRUG OVERDOSES HIV RATES HAVE PLUMMETED SINCE PORTUGAL IMPLEMENTED THAT POLICY. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE. HUNDRED ADDITION THERE'S BEEN NO INDICATION OF INCREASED USE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT IS OUR POPULATIONS OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR HEARING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS BILL. HAVE BEEN DISPROVEN. OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HI THIS BILL REFER YOU AS I MENTIONED IS A FROM TO DO. ALSO TO BE CLEAR MY PERSONAL VIEW IS WE NEED TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION TOWARDS BROADER DRUG DECRIMINALIZATION BUT THAT IS pBILL. IS ONE STOP. ON BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY USING THESE SUBSTANCES TO HEAL OUR VETERANS- TO TREAT PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA AND HAVE BEEN USED AS A SACRAMENT AND SPIRITUAL OR RELIGIOUS PRACTICES. FOR CENTURIES INCLUDING IN THIS COUNTRY AMONG NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES LET'S BRING THIS ACTIVITY OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND ENSURE WE ARE HELPING ENCOURAGE SAFER USE.

IN CONSERVATION DISPARITIES IN OUR COUNTRY I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON SB FIVE NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE NINETEEN ALLOWS ACCESS INTO SUCH A SHARING OF DRUGS. THAT ARE NOT YET REGULATED. AND WILL NOT BE REGULATED FOR QUITE SOME TIME IF THIS BILL PASSES UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WILL BE UTILIZED AS GUINEA PIGS IN EFFORT TO OBTAIN DATA OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS WELL THE COMMUNITY SUFFERS AT THE END OF A BILL THAT HAVE NEGLECTED TO ADDRESS. THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF ADDICTION AND DRUG USE. THE BILL IS COMPLETELY AFTER THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ADDICTS PREVENTION EDUCATION PRODUCTION REACHING USERS AS WELL AS HEALTH AND SOCIAL RESOURCES FOR THE COMMUNITY TO EXPERIENCE THE MOST SHAUNA FROM THIS BILL. THAT IS LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ELL THE INTO OF THE BILL GREAT IT FALLS FLAT AS A SLOT. ONE HARM AN ATTEMPT TO REMEDY. FOR SEVERAL OTHER HARMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED. FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THE SOCIAL SHARING OF SUBSTANCES THAT CAN BE ESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO BILLS. FOR ADDICTION. SUGGESTION WAS IN ITSELF. AS A GATEWAY TO MORE ADULT INDUCTION RACING USERS. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER BECAUSE BOTH IN THE COMMUNITIES AND IN POVERTY BOTH OF LOWER EDUCATION SUBSETS ARE THOSE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE. TO BE AS AN ADDICTION BY ALLOWING THE PERPETUATION OF DRUG USE IN THESE COMMUNITIES WE HINDER THE NEXT GENERATION COMING UP FROM BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES THEY ARE EXPERIENCING AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT. TO REJECT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE EVERY COUPLE OF REGARDLESS OF THE CITIES AND PROVIDE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO COMMUNITIES IN NEED THIS BILL SERVES AS AN IRRESPONSIBLE AND HASTY MANDATE THAT WILL CREATE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT QUESTIONS PLEASE ALREADY SUFFERING.

NEXT LINE PLEASE. ISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU LET'S NOW MOVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO FIRST I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING FOR THE ON THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING AN INTEREST IN FINDING ALTERNATIVE- METHODS TO TREAT SOME OF THESE AILMENTS THAT WE HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO CONQUER- BUT I. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO DECRIMINALIZE SPECIFICALLY- THE DRUG KADAM MEANS- CAN MEAN IS ONE OF THE THREE MAJOR. DRUGS USED AS A DATE RAPE DRUG. AND I HAVE GREAT CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WOULD LEGALIZE THE POSSESSION OF A DATE RAPE DRUG JUST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR GALGIANI HAD A BILL. PRESENTED PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT WOULD- MAKE IT A CRIME TO HAVE THAT DRUG FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AND SAID THIS BILL SEEMS TO WORK IN CONTRADICTION TO THAT EFFORT- I UNDERSTAND THAT CAN MEAN. THE IN SOME FORMS IS BEING USED ON TO TREAT DEPRESSION- THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT ABLE TO BE TREATED BY OTHER MEANS. THE HERE THERE'S SOME IT'S JUST STUBBORN AND THE PERSON QUITE CAN'T GET BEYOND IT SO THERE'S- SOME CLINICAL TRIALS AND TESTING TAKING PLACE IN SEEING IF CAN I MEAN CAN BE USEFUL IN TREATING SEVERE DEPRESSION DEPRESSION THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO- HAVE BEEN TREATED BY OTHER DRUGS. IN AN PTSD SORRY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE- SOME CLINICAL BENEFITS TO USING THIS DRUG FOR DEPRESSION. HOWEVER I'M- WHEN CAN I MEAN IS USED TO TREAT DEPRESSION OR PTSD IT IS USED IN A CLINICAL SETTING SO THERE'S TWO FORMS- THERE'S AN INTRAVENOUS FORM AND THEN THERE'S A NASAL SPRAY BOTH OF WHICH HAVE TO BE USED IN A MEDICAL SETTING UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT A DOCTOR PRESCRIBES AND HANDS OVER TO A PATIENT IT'S SOMETHING THAT MUST BE DONE IN A MEDICAL SETTING. SO IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME HOW SOMEONE HAVING A- SMALL AMOUNT OF THIS TYPE OF A DRUG. ON THEIR PERSON COULD BE IT COULD POSSIBLY BE USED FOR TREATING DEPRESSION OR PTSD BECAUSE THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT HOW IT'S BEING ADMINISTERED FOR THE TREATMENT OF THESE TYPES OF AILMENTS SO I WONDER IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT BEFORE I MOVE ON TO MY OTHER QUESTIONS. EARLIER IF YOU WISH TO ANSWER YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU OUT CENTER MELENDEZ FOR- FOR THE QUESTION- ON THE BILL OF COURSE DOES NOT IN ANY WAY LEGALIZE OR DECRIMINALIZE. DATE RAPE OR TRUCKING ANYONE OUT. TO RATE FROM- THAT WILL REMAIN- AN EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUS. CRIME AS IT SHOULD BE- I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IN A QUORUM COURT DATE RAPE DRUGS FIRST OF ALL. THE MOST COMMON DATE RAPE DRUG IS A DRUG CALLED ALCOHOL. AND THEN THERE'S GHB WHICH IS NOT PART OF THIS BILL AND THEN THERE ON IS- REFORM CALLED FOR RUPEES. RIGHT SO ON AND SO THERE ARE VARIOUS SUBSTANCES THAT CAN BE USED IN A REALLY. YOU KNOW AT THE END OF SOMEONE'S ASSAULTING SOMEONE ELSE. SLIPPING SOMEONE IN THEIR DRINK OR JUST GETTING THEM VERY INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL AND THEN DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE- AND THEY- SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AND THE STILL DESIGN ANYWAY. STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING- AND BUT JUST AGAIN GOING BACK TO BASICS WITH. THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IS SHOULD SOMEONE BE PROSECUTED IN A ROW. FOR POSSESSING THE DRUG. A AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT DRUG DECRIMINALIZATION IS ABOUT SHOULD BE ARRESTING AND PROSECUTION FOR POSSESSING THE DRUG ON CADMIUM DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT. THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS AND IT IS USED AND NOT HUESO ANY DRUG CAN BE MISUSED THERE ARE DRUGS THAT ARE LEGAL TODAY RIGHT NOW. SEE PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT CAN ALSO BE MISUSED- AND SO THAT THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE THAT IS NOT ANYWHERE UNIQUE- TO COMING- THANK YOU SO MISTER CHAIR- YES. JUST MOVING ON I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE USE OF CAN MEAN- THERE TO USES WELL TO THE WILL SPEAK ABOUT TODAY ONE IS IN. A CLINICAL SETTING MORE IT IS ADMINISTERED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE PATIENT IS OBSERVED IN ITS EITHER INTRAVENOUSLY GIVEN OR IT IS THROUGH A NASAL SPRAY BUT AGAIN MUST BE IN A MEDICAL SETTING IT IS NOT HANDED OUT TO A PATIENT- AND IT IS NOT IT'S- IT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN YET TO BE COMPLETELY EFFECTIVE IN TREATING THESE- ELEMENTS THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT- THERE IS. I HAVE A ARTICLE HERE FROM THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT SAYS FURTHER RESEARCH COMPARING EFFECTIVENESS AND SIDE EFFECTS IS NEEDED- ADDITIONALLY. LAKE OPIOIDS CAN MEAN HAS ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN WEIGHING RISKS AND BENEFITS IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHICH IS VERY COMMON AT LEAST WITH- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VETERANS WITH PTSD. ISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SUCH AS ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. THEN CAME TO ME MAY NOT BE A GOOD OPTION FOR YOU WITH THE NASAL SPRAY- THIS IS GIVEN. SPACE FIVE MINUTES APART UNDER DOCTOR SUPERVISION YOU REMAIN IN THE CLINIC UNDER DR OBSERVATION UNTIL POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS HAVE PASSED. IN ADDITIONALLY- IT X. THERE ARE SOME EXPERTS WHO HAVE A QUESTION THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF THIS DRUG IN PART BECAUSE IN CLINICAL TRIALS THREE STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMMITTED SUICIDE AFTER THEIR LAST AND DOES SO AGAIN- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS SHOWS SOME PROMISE CERTAINLY BUT IT IS ALSO USED AS A DATE RAPE DRUG IN WHICH- AND WE- IT IS ILLEGAL. TO HAVE THE DRUG IN YOUR POSSESSION FOR THAT EFFORT AND IF YOU MAKE IT LEGAL. TO POSSESS THIS. THEN YOU WERE OPENING UP THE DOOR. IT IS. TO ESSENTIALLY EIGHT YOU KNOW A LICENSE TO SIN N USING THIS DRUG FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES I MEAN THAT'S JUST A REALITY IF YOU SAY IT'S OKAY THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS DRUG IN YOUR POCKET. YOU MAY CATCH SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT. TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT SOMEONE BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE AN AWFUL LOT OF OTHERS THAT YOU DON'T CATCH. IT'S DIFFICULT SO WHILE I RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE ARE SOME THERAPEUTICS THAT CAN BE USED OUT THERE TO TREAT SOME OF THESE- DIFFERENT ISSUES. ARE I DON'T KNOW THAT THE- CHANGING A LAW THAT WE MADE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- IS. IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HELP OR CERTAINLY FROM FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF WOMEN IN THEIR SAFETY AT THIS POINT SO- UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU- MAY. D. JEWISH TO LOG DOT DR GRANT WERE WITNESSES IS ACTION EXPERT ON KATAMON THERAPY AND- IF THERE'S A DESIRE TO HEAR FROM ONE OF OUR TOPICS WHO ARE TO MOVE ALL AGES WHATEVER THAT QUESTIONS CENTER MELENDEZ ARE OKAY SO THAT BUT PERHAPS OF SOMEONE ELSE WHICH IS TO POSE THAT QUESTION WE CAN ASK YOUR EXPERT TO ANSWER THAT WITH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES SIR LEYVA. OPPOSITE QUESTION TO THE DOCTOR HOW DOES THE CAT MING THERAPY WORK BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE HEARD. THAT IT'S FROM IT IS VERY MUCH HELP SOME PEOPLE TO RECOVER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS OR LIVE WITH THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS SO I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DOCTOR. OKAY SO IF WE CAN BRING DR GRANT ON THE LINE TO ADDRESS US OR LEAVE US A QUESTION ABOUT USES OF COMMUNITY THERAPEUTIC. SENSE AND PERHAPS- IF YOU DON'T MIND WILL FOCUS IT ON THE TRAIN- THAT FORMS A WHICH IT WOULD BE ON A PERSON SO NOT I. V. WHICH I'VE EXPECTS ONE TURNAROUND IV BAGS SO TINY BUT. OTHER USES. OF CAN I MEAN. OCT GRANT. KIDDING IT IT IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND THAT'S- GENERALLY SAY IT'S USED IN A VARIETY OF FORMATS- SOME OF THEM ARE INTRAVENOUS OR INTRAMUSCULAR INJECTION BUT IN ADDITION TO MEAN IS THE LIVER BY INTRA NASAL SPRAY OR BY. LAW LOS. AND ALL OF THOSE FORMATS THERE ARE AT LEAST ONE PUBLISHED STUDY SHOWING. VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATES IN DEPRESSION WHICH WE HOPE COMPRESSION INSIDE ALITY OF. MORE THAN 6270% OF PEOPLE BY THE END OF THE FIRST DAY OF TREATMENT SO IT'S A REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE MEDICINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL CRISIS- THE NASAL FORM HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SO- AT THIS POINT IT'S NO LONGER INVESTIGATION WHAT IT'S REGARDED BY THE FDA AND THE STATE'S RECRUITMENT. AFTER. DEPRESSION SUICIDALITY- THERE ARE STUDIES ON GOING ABOUT. HOME NEWS INTRANASAL SPRAY AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY CORPORATE LOZENGES IT MIGHT BE. THE PERSON- I AGREE WITH DR WIENER THAT. HELLO THIS MEDICINE- HI IS NOT THE MOST COMMON- DRUG USE ON. HOW CALL BY FAR IS THAT CORRECT BEIJING PUTS MOST COMMONLY USE OF COURSE SO- INCOME. YOUR TICKET YOU SEEN THAT- PROHIBITING THE CARRYING OF THESE MEDICINES IT'S NOT PERMANENT SO WE HAVE. SEPARATE STRATEGIES FOR. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYBE I'LL JUST ASK ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION SINCE WE HAVE THE GOOD DR GRANT ON THE LINE- AS A FELLOW PHYSICIAN I ALSO UNDERSTAND- THAT KIND OF MEAN ORALLY HAS BEEN USED FOR CHRONIC PAIN AGAIN PERHAPS THE MOST COMMON FORM BUT- DAVID STATE I HAVE RUN ACROSS- RESEARCH LURCH SHOWN SOME EFFICACY IN MANAGING CHRONIC PAIN AS WELL AND ORAL FORM IS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT LITERATURE. THAT IS CORRECT I MEAN IN ORAL FORM IS. JUST HELPFUL OF PAIN MANAGEMENT AND IS COMMONLY USED IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THIS. THANK YOU I'M GLAD TO KNOW THE YOU TO HAVE SEEN SIMILAR SURE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SEVERAL MONTHS SORRY I'M KEEPING AN EYE ON THE HANDS UP THEIR SETTLEMENT. IT'S YOUR CHAIR- I WANT TO START OFF BY- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IT'S A BILL AT THE SCENE I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS AND THEY CERTAINLY SPENT A BIT OF TIME. LOOKING INTO THIS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WOULD FALL. WHAT IT WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IT IS THE FACT THAT IT CREATES A TASK FORCE AN EXPERT WORKING GROUP ANY THINK ALIGNS WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE FDA ALSO LOOKING INTO THIS- I I'D LOVE THE IDEA THAT. CALIFORNIA'S ALSO LOOKING- AT BRINGING TOGETHER- SOAPS THAT CAN HELP US THINK THROUGH THE ISSUES. YOU KNOW HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS- WHICH I'VE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR- ALTICE IN THOSE HAVE TO DO ALSO WITH THE LEGALIZATION. MDMA WHICH AT TIMES CAN BE CUT WITH THINGS LIKE MATH- AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WAS GONNA FALL WITH THIS- IN IN THE END. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN BE THERE. YOU KNOW TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF US TO THINK ABOUT WHATEVER LAND. I DON'T DOUBT. THAT THERE. ANYTHING THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THERE IS VALUE IN PSYCHEDELICS- FOR THOSE. YOU KNOW THAT IT. THAT NEEDED OR THEY CAN FIND IT HELPFUL I THINK THAT WHERE MY DISCOMFORT LIES. IS REALLY IN IN IN THIS KIND OF MULTI PROCESS OF HAVING EXPERT GROUPS CONVENE- BUT ALMOST ACTEON ON THIS BEFORE THE EXPERT GROUPS HELP US THINK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THE EXPERT GROUP GROUP BEING THE TASK FORCE BUT ALSO KNOWING THAT THE FDA- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS LOOKING AT THIS SO. THAT YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE SURE THAT EXPLAIN WHY I WILL BE THERE ON THIS BILL BUT ALSO. DO YOU REALLY THINK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO THIS AND DESPITE MY COMFORT LEVEL WITH THIS. BILL TODAY I DO UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES THESE QUESTIONS THAT WHILE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER LIMÃ³N- THE CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I'D ALSO LIKE THE AUTHOR FOR GETTING TO US FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- HAVING SPENT TIME WORKING IN AROUND ADDICTION. I CAN SAY THAT THE DRUG THAT HAS HAD THEM THE WORST IMPACT HEALTH FAMILY LEGAL. IS A VERY LEGAL DRUG ALCOHOL. AND THAT REMAINS LEGAL AND- AND A MAIN PART OF OUR ECONOMY AS WELL AS OUR SOCIETY. SO I WOULD JUST SAY AS- WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE I ILL MOVE THIS BILL- AND BECAUSE THE QUESTION BEFORE US RIGHT NOW REALLY IS AGAIN IF WE IF WE LIKE OR DON'T LIKE OR- OR SOMETHING COULD BE USED IT IS AN ABUSE OF WAY WE KNOW ANY DRUG HER. OR A KNIFE OR A GUN OR ANYTHING IT CAN BE USED- TO HURT OTHERS THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS. FOR THIS GROUP OF SUBSTANCES SHOULD WE BE ARRESTING AND- CRIMINALIZING AND PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL. FOR POSITION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING. AND SO IT WAS STRICTLY MOVE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ORDER AND OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY YEAH CENTER MELENDEZ YES I'M SORRY MR CHAIRMAN I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR BECAUSE- IT I AM. SEEING HERE THAT IT'S IT SAYS- THE BILL COMMISSION TO WORKING GROUP REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPLICATIONS OF DECRIMINALIZING THESE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND IDENTIFICATION OF REGULATED USE MODELS FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND I AM- I GUESS WONDERING WHY THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT TWO YEARS AFTER. THIS LAW WOULD GO INTO EFFECT WHY WOULD WHY WOULD WE COMMISSION A STUDY ON DOING THE VERY THING THAT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IT. SENATE WIENER I THANK YOU MR SO THE PURPOSE OF THE WORKING GROUP IS NOT TO GIVE AN OPINION ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD DECRIMINALIZE THE PURPOSE OF THE WORKING GROUP'S THE SECOND ONCE WE HAVE STOPPED. ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING FOR PEOPLE FOR POSSESSING THE SUBSTANCES. WHAT CAN WE THINK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL. REGULATION YOU RECALL THAT WITH FOR EXAMPLE CANNABIS. WE DID IT IN TWO STEPS FIRST THE VOTERS STEPPED IN AND SAID THEY WERE. GOING TO DECRIMINALIZE- MEDICINAL CANNABIS- HONESTLY THAT WAS EFFECTIVELY DECRIMINALIZATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN TWENTY YEARS LATER- THE VOTERS PASSED ON THE ADULT USE MORE REGULATORY- OUR SYSTEM IS A TWO SEPARATE THINGS. AND SO THE PURPOSE OF TASK FORCES THAT OKAY NOW WE'VE DECRIMINALIZED. STOPPED ARRESTING PEOPLE- WHY DO WE DO IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT IS FRANKLY EVEN THAT'S MORE COMPLICATED- IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL REGULATION- THERE ARE ACTIVE THE DATES RIGHT NOW ABOUT COMMERCIALIZATION. AS THERE ARE WITH FRANKLY WITH WITH CANNABIS- AND SO THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE- OF THE OF THE TASK FORCE. AND I HI I WAS THAT WE DON'T NEED A TASK FORCE TO TELL US THAT ARRESTING JAILING AND CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE FOR DRUG POSSESSION WE DON'T NEED A TEST FIRST TELL US ABOUT THIS AND MARK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I DON'T SEE ANY MICROPHONES UP NO HE ENDS UP- SO CENTER WIENER- THE ESTIMATE YOU KNOW I'M NOT NOT THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTER OF YOUR BILL- SOMEONE WHO IS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY CONCERNED- I THINK- ABOUT- ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THESE SUBSTANCES CAN HAVE HELP AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU POINTED OUT- FIRST OF ALL THEY D. AT YOUR DATE- CRIMINALIZING IT DEFINITELY HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT. AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE BROUGHT UP ALCOHOL SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY WE DID TRY CRIMINALIZING ALCOHOL. AND WITH THIS WE FIGURED OUT HOW QUICKLY HOW BADLY THAT TURNE OUT IN FACT IN WEEK I'M CRIMINALIZED ALCOHOLS- SO WE ACTUALLY TRIED THAT EXPERIMENT HERE- WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN WE'VE DONE IT AGAIN WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES INCLUDING PSYCHEDELICS- BUT ALSO NOTING THAT- WE TALK ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW THERE'D. THEY'RE NOT ADDICTIVE PER SE- SO I THINK I HAVE A TRY HAVE A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TOWARD SOME OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT WOULD- BE MORE ADDICTIVE WHAT'S HARD FOR SOMEONE TO. TO STOP USAGE- THE AS YOU POINTED OUT THEY DO HAVE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. MANY OF THEM- WELL GENERALLY I WOULD SAY THOSE SHOULD BE HANDLED UNDER PRESCRIPTION I'D ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE POSSESSING IT. SHOULDN'T BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO GET NOW FIND THEMSELVES ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WITH THAT YOU KNOWI DO THINK YOU MAKES US SOME VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENTS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF HARM TO OR CREATING BY CRIMINALIZING THE SUBSTANCES. A TIED IT IN WE DO NEED TO PROVISION- AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S TESTIMONY THAT IT'S NOT. THAT YOU KNOW WE- THAT WE DO NEED RIGHT SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE. NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES OR HAVE- YOU KNOW AND ACCESS TO. THE SITE AT THE SUBSTANCES THAT THAT THAN FORGING TURNED OUT BADLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S OF ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND SO FORTH. BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO AT LEAST- THIS PARTICULAR. SET OF- SUBSTANCES- GIVEN BOTH THEIR POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT AS WELL AS- I THINK THE WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME RISK OF HARM THAT- I THINK THAT THAT- BUT- IT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE HARM FROM THE GLOBALIZATION THINK IT'S MUCH WORSE. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD I APPRECIATE THAT. DISCUSSION I'M SURE YOU HAVE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BILL AS A NEWS FORD. I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THIS BEFORE US AND ALLOWING US TO HAVE THIS DEBATE. AND I THINK IT'S ONE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE AND- CERTAINLY TO POLICY WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. SO THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MR AND I REALLY APPRECIATETHOSE THOUGHTFUL REMARKS- AND YOU KNOW. WE KNOW THAT. WITH ANY SUBSTANCE LEGAL ILLEGAL ANY SUBSTANCE. CAN BE. MISUSED HI- ANY SUBSTANCE YOU CAN HAVE A PERSON CAN HAVE A- HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP. WITH ANY SUBSTANCE LEGAL OR ILLEGAL- AND- AND THAT'S WHY MISTER YOU AND I AND WE ALL MANY OF US IN YOUR WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THE FOR PEOPLE WHO DO DEVELOP. HARMFUL OR UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY SUBSTANCE WHETHER IT'S ALCOHOL OR MATH OR ANY SUBSTANCE THAT WE HAVE IT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO ADDICTION TREATMENT AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN FANTASTIC AND MOVING FORWARD. BILLS AND- YOU KNOW SENT A CENTER EGGMAN AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND- ON A LEADING OR MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS AND SO- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO MAKE SURE AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WHETHER WITH THE WITH ADDICTION OR OR EVEN IF A DRUG IS NOT ADDICTIVE JUST WITH AN UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITHOUT DRUGS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES. CAN ALSO SAVE LIVES AND WE'VE HEARD A AND FOR THE VETERAN THAT WE HEARD FROM WE COULD HAVE YOU KNOW IF WE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD. PUT A HUNDRED VETERANS UP THERE. OR WE COULD TALK TO A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF MINE. BACK IN THE OLD WAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS A LAWYER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE- HE AND HIS WIFE THEIR SON IS A TEENAGER BECAME BADLY ADDICTED TO HEROIN AND THERE'S A LETTER IN THE RECORD FROM HIM. AND THEY TRIED EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. TO GET HIM OFF OF HER OWN EVERYTHING FAILED IN THEIR RESOURCES AND EVERYTHING FELT. UNTIL THEY SENT HIM TO NOT BROUGH LIKE OUR VETERAN HAD TO GO TO MEXICO FOR IDLE GAME TREATMENT AND HE HAS NOT USED HER WHEN SENSE WE SHOULD NOT BE FORCING PEOPLE. UNDERGROUND OR TO TRAVEL TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO GET TREATMENT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. WE SHOULD BE TAKING THOSE STEPS AND ALLOWING PEOPLE ACCESS HERE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. J. REALLY THOUGHT DISCUSS TODAY COLLEAGUES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU SIR WIENER AT THE IT'S THIS BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER EGGMAN- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS- CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN H CAN I AM A LINDA'S NO MELINDA'S NO EGGMAN. AYE EGGMAN AYE AND SALAS HI GONZALEZ I GROWTH HER TADO. LEYVA HI LEYVA AYE LEE MON. ROTH ROTH OF ROTH AYE RUBIO. WIENER FIVE WIENER HI. SIX ONE. IS ONE. OF THOSE CURRENTLY SIX ONE WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IS OKAY GOOD IT'S AN EXCITING TIME NUMBER SEVEN SP FIVE FIVE EIGHT BY CENTER CAPITAL WELCOME. HE'S BEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE TO SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS NUMBER ONE TO DECIMATE CAL OVER YES IS THE LEAD AGENCY OF THE FARMER DISASTER RELIEF TASK FORCE. NUMBER TWO TO PROVIDE MORE TIME FOR THE TASK FORCE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FIVE FIVE EIGHT A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT BILL. THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THE FORMER DISASTER RELIEF PLANNING TASK FORCE TO EXAMINE THE NEEDS OF FARMWORKERS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR IMMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE AND LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET SERVICES AND OTHER SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELIEF DESERT DURING DISASTERS AND PANDEMICS. CREATING THIS TASK FORCE IS CRITICAL FOR A STATE TO BE IN THE RIGHT POSITION TO ASSIST FARMWORKERS DURING THE MOST CRITICAL TIME OF NEED. DURING TIMES OF A DISASTER. FARMWORKERS ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN OUR STATE AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS WE EXPERIENCE CLIMATE. RELATED EMERGENCY EVENTS SUCH AS WILDFIRES AND DROUGHTS. AS YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY. AFFECTED FARMWORKERS HELP. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE RECENT UC BERKELEY WHITE PAPER ON THE IMPACT OF COVERED NINETEEN ON FARMWORKERS. FORMER COMMUNITIES FEEL LEFT BEHIND AND RIGHTLY SO THE COMMUNITIES LIKE MANY RESOURCES WE TAKE FOR GRANTED INCLUDING ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AFFORDABLE HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND FOOD. IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN MANY FOOD P. P. E. N. NOW VACCINE DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND I'VE SEEN THE GREAT NEED TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THESE HARD WORKING FAMILIES. AND TO ENSURE SUCH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED IN A COORDINATED EFFICIENT AND NIMBLE APPROACH. THE UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC NECESSITATED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE EVER CHANGING SITUATION WE SAW MANY GAPS. FOR EXAMPLE LACK OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THE PANDEMIC LACK OF ACCESS TO KOBE TESTING AND P. P. E. LACK OF ACCESS TO FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND FINALLY. BLACK OF ACCESS TO VACCINES. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE RELY ON OUR ON THE COUNTIES TO BE OUR- TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY RESOURCES. AND THE FACT THAT EVERY COUNTY ATTACK THIS ISSUE IT IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT. TO FIRST OF ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF COORDINATION OR LACK OF COORDINATION WAS GOING ON BUT ALSO WHAT KIND OF SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE AND HOW TO BE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THAT INFORMATION TO THE FARMWORKERS COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY KNEW HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. THEY KNEW WERE TO ACCESS RESOURCES AND THEY KNEW- WHO IS IN CHARGE AND WHO WAS WHO WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. WE SAW THE NEED FOR BETTER COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH FARMWORKERS EVERYDAY AS WELL. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS OFTEN TIMES DID NOT INCLUDE THEIR INPUT. WHAT I PROPOSE WITH THIS BILL IS A CALIFORNIA DO BETTER IN THE FUTURE. THE TASK FOCE WILL HELP OUR STATE RESPONDED WITH AN EQUITY LENS AT THE FOREFRONT. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JOEL DERRINGER. OF DERRINGER AND ASSOCIATE AND STRONG ADVOCATE FOR FARMWORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. THANK YOU SENATOR AVAIL MODERATOR PRE PLEASE BRING- THE PHONE LINES OUTSIDE TOLD DURING THE- FROM DURRINGTON SOCIUS TO TESTIFY BY TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF S. C. FIVE FIVE EIGHT. AND YOU HAVE- TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE ABILITY TO COMMENT ON THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THIS CRLA FOUNDATION MY NAME IS DAHLE DERRINGER COUPLE CHRIS CHEVROLET FOUNDATION FOR THE ENTIRE TIME DURING CULTIVATED AND TRYING TO GET RELIEF FOR FARMWORKERS COMMUNITIES I ALSO FACILITATED SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FARMWORKERS. CONSORTIUM FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WORKING ON ANOTHER DISASTER. AT CENTER CUT BY SAID THIS IS THE DEAL CUTS A FARMWORKERS. PLANNING TASK FORCE TO LEARN FROM PAST DISASTERS ADDRESS PRESIDENT OF DISASTERS AND PREPARE FOR FUTURE DISASTERS HE CAN BE CLIMATE RELATED WHETHER THEY ARE CREDIBLE FLOODING HE WILD HIGHER FREEZES. ARE THEY BEAT PENN D'AMICO. OR CAN EVEN BE ECONOMIC RELATED AS WITH THE GREAT RECESSION- IN OUR WORK WITH FARM WORKER COMMUNITIES WE'VE LEARNED SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS THAT SENATOR. STATED THAT THERE IS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WHAT CO MADE THEIR FAR MORE LIKELY TO CONTRACT. PROBATED AND SUFFER CONSEQUENCES YET THEY LAGGED AND ACCESS TO TESTING VACCINATION AND MANY OTHER WILL BE BENEFITS FARMWORKERS WERE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL FROM BEGINNING. BUT FELT INVISIBLE. IT'S BEEN A DISK IN THOSE RELIEF BETWEEN STATE AGENCIES AND SYMBIOZ COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THAT ARE WELL MEANING STATE TRIGGERING RESPONSES BY MULTIPLE AGENCIES BUT OFTEN WITHOUT COORDINATION AMONG THE AGENCIES AND POTENTIALLY LOOK LOCAL AGENCIES. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND. WE'VE HAD IT'S A SENATOR STATED- DISPARATE RESPONSES BY COUNTIES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. EXCUSE ME HI LIKE A LOT OF US I THINK I'M SUFFERING FROM ALLERGIES TODAY SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME. I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE CODE ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK. THOUGHTFUL AND DILIGENT IN NOT WORKING ON THIS AND- AND I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED THE ISSUES LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS. I DON'T WANT TO DISTRACT TOO MUCH FROM THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS VERY TARGETED AND SPECIFIC. BUT I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION KIND OF THE BROADER ISSUE ON RIGHT TO REPAIR IF YOU'VE BEEN- OVERWHELMED WITH THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL YOU MIGHT THINK WHAT WHAT IS THIS BILL DOING THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE OPPOSING WELL. IT'S A LOT IT'S THIS IS A MOVEMENT THAT'S BEEN WORKING AROUND THE COUNTRY AND SO THERE'S INTEREST IN IT- A PEOPLE MAY RECALL I'VE WORKED IN THIS SPACE. FOR A WHILE AND THEN THE ISSUE IS JUST THIS WHEN. WHEN CORPORATIONS. SELL US A PRODUCT DO WE OWN IT OR DO THEY OWN IT AND IF WE OWN IT MAY WE GET IT REPAIRED. BY SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE COMPANY WHO SOLD IT TO US. I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BUT WE NEED TO QUESTION I THINK THERE'S A BUSINESS MODEL WORK FOR. EVERYDAY PEOPLE. DOES IT WORK FOR IN THISCASE HOSPITALS DOES IT WORK FOR PATIENTS. AND DOESN'T WORK FOR REPAIR PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. A LOT OF THEM SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ENTREPRENEURS- SO THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH OPPOSITION. THAT'S WHY- EVERYONE BANDS TOGETHER TO TRY TO STOP SOMETHING THEY THINK MIGHT HURT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL- THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS OF THE RIGHT TO REPAIR MOVEMENT ARE TO REDUCE WASTE. INCREASE COMPETITION FOR REPAIR TO SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES. IMPROVE PRODUCT DURABILITY AND RESTORE WHAT IT TRULY MEANS. TO OWN OUR OWN STUFF I THINK WE CAN ALL. AGREE WITH THOSE PRINCIPLES- AND OUR CONVERSATION IS TODAY WILL THIS MOVEMENT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY. IT IS HOW DO WE TRANSFERRED THESE PRINCIPLES. INTO PUBLIC POLICY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON. TODAY M. THE BILL TAKES A SIMPLE APPROACH LOOKING JUST ONE CATEGORY PRODUCTS MEDICAL DEVICES AND TRIES TO OPEN UP THE REPAIR MARKET BY ALLOWING ACCESS TO THE NEEDED PARTS TOOLS DOCUMENTATION AND SOFTWARE FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR RIGHT NOW IT IS LEGAL FOR THE HOSPITAL TO REPAIR THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT OR FOR SOMEBODY THEY CONTRACT WITH TO REPAIR EQUIPMENT THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS PURCHASED THAT THE HOSPITAL OWNS. BUT SUFFERS IS PUT INTO PLACE- THE STOP AT THE REPAIRS CAN IN FACT JUST SHUT DOWN A DEVICE IF IT IS NOT REPAIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER- AND- THERE IS NOT ENOUGH ACCESS T PARTS THE TOOLS. THE DOCUMENTATION. AS OPPOSED TO BE AMENDED ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES. SPITTLE ON THE MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF THEIR EQUIPMENT. REPORTING EARLY ON IN THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC I THINK HIGHLIGHTED JUST NOT JUST THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT STOCKPILES BUT THE CHALLENGES PRESENT AND TRYING TO REPAIR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. AND I THINK THE KEY TAKEAWAY IS THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT IT WAS AN EXISTING PROBLEM LIKE A LOT OF THINGS MADE VISIBLE TO US BY THE PANDEMIC. HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MAY EMPLOY IN HOUSE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS AND TAX AND THEY MAY WORK WITH INDEPENDENT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ON ALA CARTE OR CONTRACT BASIS THESE ARE PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK ON MEDICAL EQUIPMENT FOR A LIVING. STOP TO THINK ABOUT THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WE RUN INTO UST TRYING TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO RUN A COMMITTEE HEARING FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHY IS IMPORTANT FOR HOSPITALS TO HAVE PEOPLE READY THERE TO BE ABLE TO FIX THINGS. THESE PROFESSIONALS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MANUFACTURE CREATED BARRIERS TO REPAIR IS CRUCIAL HINDRANCE IN THEIR WORK AND TO PATIENT CARE LAST SPRING IN A SURVEY OF BIO MED'S. U. S. PARADE FOUND THAT 92% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED THEY HAD BEEN DENIED ACCESS TO SERVICE INFORMATION FOR CRITIC CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. 30% REPORTED EQUIPMENT IN THEIR FACILITIES THAT THE DATE COULD NOT BE USED DUE TO RESTRICTIONS ON SPARE PARTS AND SERVICE INFORMATION. AND NEARLY 70% OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEIR HOSPITAL HAS HAD TO DELAY. A PATIENT PROCEDURE BECAUSE THEY WERE WAITING ON A MANUFACTURER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO FIX A DEVICE. THE SURVEY NUMBERS HELP PAINT A PICTURE. THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS WHO SUPPORT THIS THIS EFFORT AND REPORT THAT MANUFACTURES OFTEN UNABLE TO SERVICE EQUIPMENT AT THE TIME FRAME NEEDED AND THE HOSPITAL'S TEAM MUST DECIDE BETWEEN TAKING A MACHINE THAT IS DUE FOR REGULAR MAINTENANCE OFFLINE. OR NOT HAVING MET ITS MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE. WHO IS THE SERVICE WHO BENEFIT FROM HOSPITAL'S MACHINES GOING OFFLINE OR MISSING MAINTENANCE EXPERTS ON THE SCENE OR DENIED THE TOOLS PARTS AND INFORMATION THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS. THE OPPONENTS WILL ARGUE THAT THIS EQUIPMENT IS TOO COMPLICATED THE ONLY THEIR TRAIN PEOPLE CAN REPAIR THEM. BUT THE WRIST CARE REALLY FALLS ON THE PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS WHO RELY ON THESE MACHINES. AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND HEALTH PROVIDERS AGREE THAT THIS BILL WOULD HELP THEM. I THINK THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT A GREAT JOB BREAKING DOWN THE FINDINGS OF THE FDA REPORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT A SAFETY PROBLEM EXIST. WITH THE SERVICING MANY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF MEDICAL DEVICES BY EITHER THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATIONS. OR MANUFACTURERS. IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH RIGHT THAT WAS FTA BECAUSE I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION OF THE FTA SAID THERE'S ALL THESE PROBLEMS THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT A SAFETY PROBLEM EXIST WITH THE SERVICING. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF MEDICAL DEVICES BUT YOU THE THIRD PARTY THE ORGANIZATIONS OR MANUFACTURERS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLYREQUIRING THAT THE SAME PARTS TOOLS INFORMATION SOFTWARE AND TRAINING AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS AUTHORIZED REPAIR NETWORK. ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE THIRD. PARTIES AN IN HOUSE ENGINEERS WORKING ON THIS CRITICAL EQUIPMENT. WHEN DEVICES GO OFFLINE AND CARES DELAYED ITS PATIENTS THAT SUFFER. THIS BILL CAN INCREASE PUMP COMPETITION HOPEFULLY REDUCE COSTS AND HELP PEOPLE. IGNORE LOGIC THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO CAN FIX THINGS WHOSE JOB IT IS TO FIX THINGS. AND SAYS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE RIGHT PARTS. TOOLS AND DOCUMENTS TRACING TO THEY CAN SAFELY AND TIMELY DO THAT. I'D ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT IS KEVIN O. RILEY WITH U. S. PURRING IN. MOTHER HAMMOND A SEASONED CLINICAL. ENGINEERING MANAGER OF TWENTY YEARS. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN MODERATOR CAN PLEASE BRING ONLINE FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT KEVIN O. RILEY FROM U. S. PERK AND IN THE DARK. HAMID CLINICAL. ENGINEERING MANAGER. AND WILL BEGIN WITH- KEVIN A RILEY AND JUST REMINDER FOR. BOTH OF YOU- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES APIECE OR TOTAL FOUR MINUTES SO IF- KEVIN A RILEY GOES OVER THAT CUTS INTO THE FOUR MINUTES- SO IF- CAN RILEY'S READY- PLEASE BEGIN. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIR CAN A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S KEVIN O. RILEY I NAY RIGHT TO REPAIR ADVOCATE WITH US PURGING CAL PERCOCO SPONSORED THE BILL. MANUFACTURERS ROUTINELY RESTRICT HOSPITAL IN INDEPENDENT BIOMEDICAL REPAIR TECHNICIANS ARE BY A MESSAGE FROM ACCESSING ESSENTIAL OKAY MATERIALS. AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC WIPES MARCH ONE INDEPENDENT SERVICE ORGANIZATION RECEIVED A HUNDRED VENTILATORS FROM THE HOSPITALS THAT WORKS WITH. DEFENSE NEED ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND TESTING BEFORE THEY COULD BE PUT TO USE BUT THE MANUFACTURER IF USED TO SELL THE INDEPENDENT THE KIDS NEEDED TO DO THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE A THIRD PARTY. AS A RESULT IT WAS MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE HOSPITALS WERE ABLE TO PUT THAT IN A LETTER FROM THE TRUCK STRATEGIC STOCKPILE AND USE. FOUR MONTHS OF THE COULD NOT BE USED TO TREAT COPD PATIENTS. PATIENTS DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT MUCH OF THE WEIGHT ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC AND THIS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN WITHIN A LEADERS ARE JUST HAPPEN WITHIN AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT'S NO WONDER THE BILL AS RECEIVED SUCH STRONG SUPPORT FROM HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COUNTIES THAT OFTEN EXPERIENCE LONGER. WAITS FOR MANUFACTURE TECHNICIANS. MANY FACTORS ARE. THAT WHILE THE NOT. ASPECTS OF THE- IT IS A BIT NOW. NOT ONE TO PROTECT PROTECT US. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE DAMAGE REPAIRS FRICTIONS THE PATIENTS OR THE FACT THAT IT RAISES THE COST HEALTHCARE- TAKE SAFETY CONCERNS SERIOUSLY SO WE LOOKED AT THE DATA AND IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE A REPORT TO THE CENTRE MENTION. IT STATED THAT MANY THIRD PARTY ENTITIES PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE SERVICING ON MEDICAL DEVICES. AND THAT THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY ENTITIES TO SERVICE AND REPAIR MEDICAL DEVICES IS CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT'S WHY WE AND OTHER CONSUMER AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS SUPPORT SB SIX OH FIVE. AT CYBER SECURITY GOES EXPERTS AGREE THAT REPAIR ACCESS IS NOT LEAD TO INCREASE ON OUR ABILITIES. THE BEST PRACTICES FOR SECURING DATA AND DEVICES DOESN'T INVOLVE WALKING A REPAIR. SB SIX OH FIVE WILL HELP PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS IN EVERY CORNER CALIFORNIA.

THE REPETITIVE THE DEVICE TO MAKE SURE I'S AVAILABLE FOR PATIENT CARE BECAUSE THAT PERSON WAS AT FATAL RISK. IN THOSE MOMENTS WE DIDN'T HAVE DAYS OR WEEKS TO WAIT FOR THE MANUFACTURERS RESPONDED WITH THE FLU THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS EFFICIENT NEEDED THAT DEVISED BY THE WAY FISHABLE MONTH WAIT.

TO SERVICEMEN WENT. AND THEY'RE ONLY WILL THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES QUALIFIED IT'S NOT ACCURATE AND THIS NONSENSE THE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS ON MY TEAM AND HAD UNDER SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE UTILIZE AND WORK WITH. WE EARNED DEGREES AND CERTIFICATIONS UNDERGARMENT THAT THROUGH CONTINUOUS CONTINUED EDUCATION HOSPITAL IN CALIFORNIA HOLISTIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FEELING RECENTLY DANCE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY POST THE BILL. PATIENT SAFETY IS AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE COMMUNITIES AMONG MOST HEAVILY REGULATED IN THE WORLD. ADMINISTRATION REGULATE EVERYTHING WE DO FOR ITS QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATION THAT COVERS ALL ASPECTS OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY. U. S. MARKET SERVICE REPAIR CYBER SECURITY FOR CONNECTED DEVICES. MEMBERS WE SEE NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMIC SHORTAGES OR DELAYS IN REPAIRS BUT RESPECTED VENTILATORS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT GENERALLY ARE DURING THE PANDEMIC NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT REPAIR DELAYS A LARGE THE PFT OR HHS DURING THE PANDEMIC. NO CREDIBLE NATURALLY OCCURRING NEWS STORIES REPORTED THE ISSUE AS ME NOW ALSO POINTS OUT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE SPACE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY THOUSAND INDEPENDENT SERVICE ORGANIZED. ORGANIZATION UNITED STATES. YESTERDAY YES THE REPORT ACTUALLY STATES THAT AND I QUOTE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE NOT SUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN REALLY SERVICING. BUT OTHER EVIDENCE AND WORK OF THE FDA POINTS OUT PROBLEMS INCLUDING AT THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT DOCUMENTED. CASES OF INJURIES AND DEATHS. SIR ORDER AND BY AND ARE NOW REGULATE FOR MEDICAL REPAIR NOT BY THE FDA NOT BY THE- ONLY MY WASTE. ARE REGULATED MEDICAL DEVICE REPAIRS BY THE FDA RETIRING ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S GIVE OVER EVERYTHING WILL ONLY INCREASE THE USE OF FUND REGULATE TECHNICIAN WITH INCREASED RISK. PATIENT CLOTHING INJURIES AND DEATHS IN THE NAME OF COST SAVINGS. IF THE STATE IS GOING TO CREATE A RIGHT TO REPAIR I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOU START WITH THE SANDWICHING A MEDICAL DEVICE SERVICING AND REPAIR LICENSE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. WITH APPROPRIATE TRAINING EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS SENATORS IT'S AN EXTREMELY COMPLEX ISSUE IN THE FDA IN CONGRESS NEEDS RESOLVE IT BY CREATING A COMPLETE REGULATED ECOSYSTEM OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN ALL PARTIES. THIS BILL MAKE THINGS WORSE CAUSE CONFUSION GREAT LAWSUITS PUSH. UP COSTS. INSTEAD FURTHER RISK I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO READ MATH SAID- MISTER GREASED LEFT YET GAVE YOU- NECK FIVE SECONDS ON TOP YOUR TWO MINUTES. PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RANDY MATHIS AND THE DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER FOR PHILLIPS. HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES A VARIETY OF MEDICAL DEVICES INCLUDING MRI. CT CAP LABS X. THREE AND MORE. I'VE BEEN WITH BILLS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY AND I CURRENTLY OVERSEE DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'VE WORKED IN THE INDUSTRY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS STARTING IN THE BIO MED FOR THE MILITARY BUT ALSO SERVED AS A FIELD ENGINEER AS WELL AS THE TECHNICAL SPECIALIST. WE WORK IN IT INDUSTRY SHARE THE COMMON GOAL OF DELIVERING THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE INCLUDING. HAVING ACCESS TO A RELIABLE AND CLINICALLY ACCURATE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THE CHEATING SKILLED CARPENTRY SERVICE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. REQUIRED MORE THAN HAVING ACCESS TO INSPECT INSTRUCTION MANUALS AND DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION. IT TAKES A COMBINATION OF TRADITIONAL SCHOOLING TECHNICAL TRAINING MENTORSHIP CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TOTAL IMMERSION IN THE PRODUCT. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL GIVES VIRTUALLY ANYONE THE TWO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TAXES NEEDED TO TINKER WITH ANY MEDICAL DEVICE. REGARDLESS OF EXPERIENCE IN TRAINING AND WITHOUT INSURANCE TO REGULATORY CONTROLS AND OVERSIGHT. SPECIFICALLY THERE IS NO REGULATION OF UNAUTHORIZED INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDERS THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW THEY ARE TRAINED. THE QUALITY OF THEIR WORK IN THE PARK THE USE. IN THE WORLD HIGH PRESSURE MEDICAL SERVICE DELIVERY PEOPLE MAY UNKNOWINGLY OR KNOWINGLY OVERSTEPPED THEIR TRAIN CAPABILITIES. OR COMPROMISE STANDARDS RESULTING IN DECREASED SERVICE QUALITY AND. INCREASED PATIENT THANK YOU READ. THE CONCERN REMARKETING. THE SYSTEM EXISTS ALREADY GIVE HIGH. CHOICES IN HEALTH FILE MEDICARE AUTHOR I THIRD PARTY SERVICE. CURRENTLY HAVE THE UPPER. TO ENTRY ALONG OF OUR ENGINEER. AND OBTAIN THE DIE. TOOLS AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION NEEDED TO RESOLVE ISSUES TO CONCLUDE WE SHOULD ALWAYS STRIVE TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY. BUT THIS BILL IS THE MOVE BACKWARD BY CREATING A PROCESS THAT WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE WHO MAY LACK THE RIGHT EXPERTISE TO CERTAIN COMPLEX MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT OR REGULATION FOR THESE REASONS I ASK YOU. TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU.

AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THE TIME OKAY THANK YOU- THAT LET'S MOVE IT BACK TO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEND RUBIO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- YOU KNOW OKAY GONNA THINK EVERYONE WHO TESTIFIED IN FAVOR AND OPPOSE- I'M TAKING YOUR COMMENTS VERY SERIOUSLY AND NOW THIS IS. A MEDICAL DEVICE CLARITY THAT THE NATURE OF THIS BILL IS VERY SENSITIVE AND IT SAVES LIVES BUT IT COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY. GO THE OTHER DIRECTION SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS IF I MAY- WELL FIRST OF ALL I JUST HEARD THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THE THERE ISN'T A REPORT BY THE FDA THAT- STATES THAT. THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT EXISTED FOR THIRD PARTY FIXES THESE MACHINES- WELL FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO ASK IF I CAN. HAVE YOUR STUFF THEN THAT REFER TO BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO READ IT BUT- SECONDLY. ALONG THOSE LINES I ALSO HEARD BE OPPOSITION STATE THAT THE FD EIGHT. HEAVILY REGULATES THEM SO I JUST KIND pABOUT THAT PART THE REGULATION PART OF THE FTA IS NOT REGULATING. FOR HAVING THE OVERSIGHT WHO WOULD TAKE OVER THE OVERSIGHT AND BE. ON TOP OF THESE ISSUES IF I CAN HAVE THAT ANSWER THANK YOU. THE SO THAT THE FDA REPORT IS. I CAN I CAN SEND YOU A COPY BUT IT IS DETAILED THROUGH AND SIX THROUGH EIGHT. OF THE ANALYSIS IT'S A- IS THERE- SO AS AS AS DAY AS EVERYONE HAS SAID THIS IS ALREADY REGULATED THE THIRD PARTY PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS THE HOSPITALS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS THE SAME PLACE THAT THE COMPANY MIGHT GET THEIR CERTIFICATES I MEAN THESE ARE STANDARD RIGHT WE HEARD FROM THE WITNESS SAID THAT THE THOUGHT TO THE FDA AND CMS DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM WHILST STILL REGULATES IS STILL REGULATED- SO IT DOES SO THAT HASN'T CHANGED WHAT WHAT THIS BILL AND TRIES TO DO AS AS YOU HAVE HEARD PEOPLE LIKE WILL CLOSE DOWN THE SOFTWARE. WILL NOT LET YOU HAVE PARTS WILL SOMETIMES PUT THE DEVICE IT IN OFTEN USABLE IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THE ONES TO WORK ON IT VETERANS STUFF TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP MORE TO THINK AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE ALREADY HAPPENING AND SO IN CMS. IS A REGULATING AGENCY. SO THAT SO THAT DOESN'T CHANGE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER- I ALSO I THOUGHT I HEARD- THAT IF THE HOSPITAL'S TAKEOVER THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. THE MANDATE- OF RECORDING DEBTS MAYBE I HEARD IT WRONG AND I KNOW THAT WHEN SPEAKERS SPEAK AND IN FAVOR OR IN OPPOSITION THEY'RE BRINGING AGAINST THE TIME CLOCK IN THE TALK REALLY FAST SO IF I MISS THAT I APOLOGIZE CAN SOMEONE CLARIFY THAT I THOUGHT I HEARD HIM SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THE FDA REQUIRES YOU TO A DOCUMENTATION AS IT PERTAINS TO FATALITIES BUT NOT IF THE MEDICAL HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS HAVE TO KEEP RECORDS OF THIS ANYBODY. VERIFY THAT. OF SO SOMEBODY DYING A DEVICE. THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. I AM GAP ASSERTION STATED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO KEEP THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO KEEP RECORDS FOR THE FDA OF FATALITIES OR- NOT RAINY DEBTS BUT THAT IF THE- IF IT'S OUT OF THEIR HANDS THAT. THE HOSPITALS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KEEP RECORDS OF ANYBODY. A PASSING BASED ON THESE EQUIPMENTS THAT ARE REPAIRED I THINK WITH THEIR I WOULD. I WOULDN'T LET MY WITNESSES SPEAK BUT I WOULD GUESS WHAT THEY'RE SPEAKING ABOUT IS THAT OF SOMEBODY DIES FROM A DEVICE THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS TO REPORT HOW MANY DEATHS ARE CAUSED BY A DEVICE. THAT THE I DON'T THINK HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHO HAS WORKED ON THAT BUT ALL OF MY WITNESSES ANSWER- SO IT. ACTUALLY IS ONE OF THE- PROPONENTS. CAN SPEAK TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY HOSPITALS FOR ANY INJURY OR DEATH CAUSED BY A DEVICE. HI THIS IS NOT AT HOME WITH YES YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES PLEASE IF YOU CONDUCT A GIVEN YESTERDAY BUT I CAN DEFINITELY SPEAK TO THAT- IN ANY CASES OF INCIDENT THE WHETHER IT'S FATAL OR NONFATAL- THE HOSPITAL'S OBLIGATED TO REPORT TO THE FDA. AND IT DEPENDS ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE EVENT IT BECOMES MORE CRITICAL AND WE HAVE THE REPORT IN A TIMELY MANNER WE ARE REGULATED ON THAT ASPECT AND WE REPORTED WE HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED MET FUND IT'S HAVE TO FOLLOW AND WE ARE OBLIGATED SOMETHING OPTION. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE AS WELL AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THAT WE ARE REGULATED BY CMS AND THE JOINT COMMISSION WHICH CONTROLS THE QUALITY AND THE QUALIFICATION. OF THE PEOPLE PERFORMING THE WORK. I HOPE THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YES AND THANK YOU LAST IF I MAY. AND THIS GOES TO THE- THE ISSUE OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS ON SITE- IN TERMS OF THEIR EXPERTISE I'M SORRY I'M NOT AN EXPERT SO I JUST KIND OF WANTED. TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE TRANSFERENCE OF EXPERTISE IS THERE. SORT OF A TRIAL ERROR TIME WHERE YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE HOSPITAL'S TAKEOVER IF THE FIXING OF THE MACHINES. HOW DO THEY GAIN EXPERTISE DO THEY SPEND TIME YOU KNOW WORKING ON IT AND I YOU KNOW IF WE CAN ASK ONE OF THE BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERS BECAUSE I HEARD THAT. THROUGH THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY SPEND HOURS PRACTICING AND THEN THERE'S CONTINUING EDUCATION I MEAN I JUST FOR MY PEACE OF MIND IS THERE. ANY YOU KNOW FOLLOW UP EDUCATIONAL THOSE MACHINES HOW TO BEGIN THAT EXPERTISE. SO DO YOU WANT YES I CAN ANSWER THAT AS WELL- AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. SO WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT UNDER THE CMS THE- ARTICLE FOUR EIGHTY TO THE FORTY ONE B. ONE HI. AND UNDER THE JOINT COMMISSION. UNDER THE CHAPTER OF ENVIRONMENT OF SCARCITY THAT BOOK ONE BOOK ONE. WE ARE REQUIRED. TO ONLY ALLOW QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO WORK ON MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. AND PARTS OF THIS BILL IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR. IS FOR THE MANUFACTURERS TO ALLOW US TO BE TRAINED ON THE SYSTEM WITHOUT BEING BLOCKED. WE HAVE AN EX WE HAVE A LIVE EXAMPLE IN MY DEPARTMENT I SENT ONE OF MY ENGINEERS. TO ACCOMPANY- WHICH WAS. WITNESSED ON THE OPPOSITION AND WE WERE TRAINED ON THE DEVICE AND THEY SAID WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO WORK ON THE DEVICE ONCE WE CAME BACK. WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THE DEVICE WHEN IT CAME ON PATIENT. WE WERE SURPRISED THAT THE LITTLE WALK BEHIND THE SERVICE HE- RECALLED THE COMPANY WE SAID. HEY WE WERE TRAINED YOU GIVE US PERMISSION TO WORK ON THE DEVICE BUT- NOW IT'S ASKING ME FOR THE SERVICE HE CAN YOU GIVE ME IS A RISKY THEY SAID NO YOU HAVE TO SIGN A CONTRACT. THEN WHY THE HECK DID I GET THE SAME. SO THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR TRAINERS ALONG WITH THE CONTAINS. ALLOWS TO GET THE TOOLS EVEN IF YOU'LL TELL ME THAT I'M FINE. BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR JOB. WITH THE YOU FOR THAT ANSWERED TO WANNA THINK YOU ALSO FOR INDULGING THE SKY. STOP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO ASSERTED GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME COME BACK TO AND ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ON THIS- ED. I HATE. TO MAKE IT CALLING FROM STOCKTON I. I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL I LIKE THE BILL I DO I THINK IF IT'S YOUR EQUIPMENT YOU CAN REPAIR IT OR HAVE SOMEBODY REPAIRED AT A LOWER COST- BY ALL MEANS DO IT. I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE- THE FINES AND PENALTIES- YOU KNOW A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR- AND THEN A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY AND THEN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY FOR EVERY DAY- THAT A VIOLATION OCCURS. I THINK THAT- I THINK THAT'S A LOT. AND I MEAN A LOT I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HOLD- MANUFACTURERS AND PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BUT I JUST THINK THAT THE CONTINUING DOLLAR AMOUNT AND JESS DRIVES A LITIGATION AND ATTORNEYS TO BE INVOLVED IN- I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THAT BT I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I DO I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING I REALLY DO BECAUSE I HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES DURING THE PANDEMIC WE LEARN THAT. PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPAIR AND THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT AND SO I'M I DO AGREE WITH THAT I JUST REALLY I HAVE A MIXED ABOUT THOSE PENALTIES AGAINST- MANUFACTURERS I HAVE AGING STUDENTS THOSE FOR PENALTIES AGAINST EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO- THERE'S NO CEILING. OF IT TOOK FORTY FIVE DAYS AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TOOK THIRTY DAYS TIMES. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE TECHNICAL ISSUES I HAVE A REAL ANGST ON THAT. IT AFFECTS EVERY NO THAT'S A THAT'S A QUESTION WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO LOOK AT THINGS BUT THAT'S FOR THE DENIAL OF INFORMATION FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. RIGHT THAT'S THAT THAT IS WHAT THE FINE IS FOR IT IS THE OUTRIGHT DENIAL THE REFUSAL. OF SOMEBODY TO PROVIDE DIVIDE THE INFORMATION AT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. I APOLOGIZE I COULDN'T HEAR WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. HI I APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY I SAID. BUT THE FINE IS FOR THE DENIAL RIGHT IF THIS BILL GOES INTO AFFECT. STATE SOMEBODY'S WORKING ON A RESPIRATOR AND THEY HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OUT OF IT. THAT IS WHAT THE FINE IS FOR RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST. IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING BEING LATE IT'S THE REFUSAL OF PROVIDING THE INFORMATION. THAT WERE THAT THE BILL ASK FOR. OKAY I APOLOGIZE SO I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT ON THE ANALYSIS SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE FINE IF THE BILL PASSES ONLY IF SOMEONE IS FIXING THEIR EQUIPMENT AND THEY GET BLOCKED OUT OF THE ABILITY TO USE THAT EQUIPMENT WE'RE SAYING THAT THE WE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IF THERE'S TRAINING AS AS AT THE WITNESSES STATED. OR IF THEY'RE EGGMAN INDEED IF YOU CAN TALK TO YOU CAN TALKING SIDEWAYS I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO FACE CENTER GROVE BUT YOU CAN TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE I HAVE A BETTER THE HEALTH CHECK UP YEAH THANK YOU SORRY. THANK YOU THIS IS ALWAYS AWKWARD WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING TO PEOPLE AND YOU CAN'T LOOK AT THEM. IN TO WEARING MASKS. BUT I WAS SAYING WHAT GOES INTO EFFECT IN THIS BILL THE FINE IS FOR. SOMEBODY NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT IT IS NOT JUST. BY ME. SO YES I GUESS I GUESS YOUR ISSUE IS A FEW YOU DON'T LIKE A FINE. FOR SOMEBODY NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW THEN. SO I UNDERSTOOD THE FINE TO BE JUST ASSESSED IF- I HAD A DIFFERENT MISGUIDED DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING AGAIN TRYING TO LOOK AT YOU AND SPEAKING THE MICROPHONE. A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE FINE WAS FOR AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING IT. THANK YOU. CENTER TADO. THANK YOU BOB BE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY JUST WANT TO DO I ALWAYS HAVE JUST FROM CHALLENGES WITH WITH- YOUR SUPPORT ANY KIND OF BILL THAT HAS ANY KIND OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT I THINK THAT YOU MEANWHILE I THINK THIS COULD- OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO HELP AND- HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD WHEN APPROPRIATE OKAY SO THE BILLS BEING MOVED BY SARTANA PROVE YOU TIME AT CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MISTER AND- HI I SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK THE RIGHT. TO REPAIR IS REALLY IMPORTANT- ALSO IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE IN A LOT OF WAYS IN THIS IS. EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND I'M CONFIDENT AUTHOR WILL HAVE OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL- AND ALL ARE ENCOURAGED AND I GO TO THANK YOU SIR LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE FINES BUT WHAT I TELL PEOPLE OF THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THEN IT IS JUST A SUGGESTION SO IF YOU DON'T VIOLATE WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO DO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE FINE SAID. YOU WON'T HAVE TO PAY THEM. ENFORCEMENT MAC MECHANISMS HELP MAKE SURE PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL HANDS UP. EVERYONE OKAY. RIGHT SO SIR EGGMAN AT FIRST I WANNA THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF- WE DID NARROW THE BILL TO HOSPITALS BECAUSE THERE IS THAT ACCOUNTABILITY THE HOSPITAL HAS TO REPORT. TO CMS- WE WANT TO BE SURE WE HAD THAT ELEMENT OF. SAFETY WITH IT IS NOT JUST SOME RANDOM PERSON BE ABLE TO DEMAND. THIS EQUIPMENT TO BILL REPAIR EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR- THROUGH THE HOSPITAL SO I APPRECIATE DOING THAT. I THINK I AT LEAST ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR SAYING THE FINES APPLY IF THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY VIOLATING THIS LAW I THINK IF. THE PEOPLE NEEDS MORE CLARITY ON THAT I GUESS I'M SURE YOU'LL WORK WITH PEOPLE DOWN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PLAY GOTCHA. I THINK- DO WE BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- AND- YEAH. I THINK IT'S AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE WE DO WANT TO TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS AT THE SAME TIME THESE ARE MEDICAL DEVICES SO I KNOW THAT PERSONALLY OF THAT THAT THAT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE- INSURING THAT IT'S REPAIRED CORRECTLY- SO- BUT I'D CERTAINLY SUPPORTING THE BILL APPRECIATE THAT- YOUR- WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS.

SCHOOLS OF COURSE SERVICE IMPORTANT FRONTLINE ACCESS FOR SCREENING FOR IDENTIFICATION AND IN SOME CASES FOR DELIVERY OF CARE.
