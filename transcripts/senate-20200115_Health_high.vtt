00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.379
SELLERS THERE ISA MECHANISM

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:04.317
TO. ADDRESS TO TRY TO PUNISH

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:04.817
THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.253
PATIENT BROKERING ON THE FLIP

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.188
SIDE THOUGH IS THAT AND I KNOW

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.623
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE HOME SIDE

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.158
BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY THE

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.327
FHA IS STRUCTURED. WE CAN'T. I

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:15.394
MEAN IT'S A IT'S A LIVING

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.197
SITUATION IT'S- IT AND SO WE

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.166
CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.302
THAT- SO. SO WHAT'S YOUR I MEAN

00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:24.337
HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE AS

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.772
RESOLVING THAT ISSUE IN YOUR

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.507
CURRENT BILL BECAUSE I THINK AT

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.577
LEAST THE WAY I'VE SEEN IT IS

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:32.211
THAT. THE DOES RUNNING CONFLICT

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.481
WITH THE FHA. THANK YOU FOR

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:38.918
THAT QUESTION. SENATOR POUND

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.286
ARE I THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEEN I

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.854
THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN STRUGGLING

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.755
WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.323
BEEN TWENTY YEARS OF FILE

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.627
LEGISLATURA LAWS PROPOSED HERE

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.363
TO TRY TO CURB WHAT SEEMS TO BE

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.130
ON I'M JUST GOING TO SAY IT THE

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.132
WAY I SEE IT I ABSOLUTE ABUSE

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.434
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RECOVERING

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.236
FROM ONE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.672
ANOTHER AW SOMETHING NEEDS TO

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.674
BE DONE WITH THE ONES THAT ARE

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.909
CONSIDERED GROUP HOMES THEY

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.610
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT DID

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:07.480
MANAGE TO. SLIDE AMONGST ALL OF

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.582
THE REGULATIONS BECAUSE A SOBER

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.384
LIVING HOME CAN HAVE MORE THAN

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.852
SIX PEOPLE I THINK THAT THAT

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.187
WAS THE CONCERN ORIGINALLY

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.322
PEOPLE THOUGHT- A SOBER LIVING

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:17.957
HOME YOU CAN ONLY HAVE SIX ONE

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:18.991
NO BECAUSE IT'S A GROUP HOME IS

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:20.426
A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.628
PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:25.264
COULD BE ALCOHOL DRUGS WHATEVER

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:25.798
THAT COME TOGETHER TO LIVE

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:28.834
TOGETHER AS A GROUP. SO WHAT'S

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.670
MISSING CLEARLY IS TO HAVE

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:34.373
THESE SET OFFFOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.708
DISABLED AFFLICTED WITH

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.443
SUBSTANCE ABUSE COMPARED TO

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.044
THOSE WHO ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.980
DISABLED ALL WHO ARE DISABLED

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.683
TO PHYSICALLY- LAWS LIKE OUR

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.184
ELDERS SENIORS ALL OF THOSE

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:49.188
OTHER- PROTECTED CLASSES IS

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.189
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.692
HAPPENING IN THE SUBSTANCE

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.360
ABUSE ARENA. AND THE SOBER

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.594
LIVING HOMES ARE BAD ACTORS

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:56.796
LET'S SAY DISCOVERED THAT THEY

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:57.930
CAN WEAVE THEIR WAY THROUGH

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.031
THAT IS STILL GO OUT TO THE

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.734
COMMUNITY AND BASICALLY RECRUIT

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.069
ALL THOSE ARE LIVING ON THE

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:05.338
STREET OBVIOUSLY ENGAGE AND

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.306
THEN REFER THEM FOR A SOBER

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:08.975
LIVING HOME- DIRECTLY TO A

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:13.179
TREATMENT FACILITY. SO THERE'S

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:13.813
ANOTHER CHAIN WE STOPPED AT THE

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:17.683
R. T. OUT. FROM OB RECRUITING

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.517
INTO THAT WE DID OT STOP AT

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:19.185
THE OTHER END SO THEY'RE COMING

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.419
IN THE OTHER WAY THEY'RE COMING

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:21.287
INTO GROUP HOMES ALCOHOL AND ON

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.456
A MISS WHATEVER. WILLING THEIR

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:24.056
TO RECRUIT PEOPLE AND THEY'RE

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.492
GOING INTO IT IS JUST. A

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.994
RECOVERY RESIDENTS WHICH HAS

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.664
NO- MANDATORY- RESTRICTION ON

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.199
NUMBER IN THE HOME NO TREATMENT

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.867
CAN BE GIVEN YET. THEY'RE

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.469
COMING IN THAT WAY AND THEY'RE

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:38.838
NOT ACTUALLY. I THINK SOLVING

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.506
THE PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:41.474
THE REASON THEY GATHER TOGETHER

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.743
SO WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY. AND I

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.511
DO THINK THAT THE- THE MEMBERS

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.246
THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED OF THE

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.949
DISCUSSION OF COMMERCIALLY- RUN

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.550
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WOULD

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:54.320
AFFECT THE ZONING ISSUE THAT A

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.021
LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.055
RESTRICTED BECAUSE NOW IT'S

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.124
COMMERCIAL. AND MAKE IT GO TO

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.325
SOME OTHER PART OF THE CITY AND

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.359
THEY WANT THESE HOMES TO BE IN

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:03.396
A IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. SO PEOPLE

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:05.398
ARE SURROUNDED WITH WHAT IS

00:11:05.464 --> 00:11:08.434
LACKEY HOME QUOTE UNQUOTE HI TO

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.470
RECOVER AND BECOME PART OF. THE

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.205
COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY KICK

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:14.774
THEIR HABIT WHATEVER IDEA SO I

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.342
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS BUT I

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.710
DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.478
KICK THE CAN DOWN THE- ROAD

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:21.047
WHEN YOU NOW HAVE AN

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:23.682
OPPORTUNITY BEING PRESENTED.

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:24.350
ARE THAT THEY COME IN THE OTHER

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.685
WAY BECAUSE WE SHUT OFF. YOU

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.320
KNOW THE OF THE ROAD AND THREE

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:30.356
THE RTO SPENT WE STILL HAVE

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:32.391
THIS OPEN DOOR ON A SOBER

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.226
LIVING HOME WILL CONTINUE TO

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.995
WORK ON IT BOB CERTAINLY I

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:36.996
WOULD BE VERY PLEASED TO TAKE

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.798
ON. THE MINNESOTA BEEN

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:41.067
SUGGESTED BY THOSE WHO ARE.

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.935
SUPPORT WITH AMENDMENTS I THINK

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:43.836
THAT'S A START IN THE RIGHT

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.639
DIRECTION BUT T&lt;c.cyan&gt; LEAVE IT TO&lt;/c&gt;

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.774
THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS AND-

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:53.345
YOU KNOW. FIND A. PUT AWAY OR

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:53.913
SEND ME OUT TO DO SOME MORE

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:57.149
WORK. FIND IT BECAUSE I HAVE

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.651
BEEN DOING THIS SINCE I WAS

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:00.719
ELECTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:01.353
I HAVE A FEW MORE YEARS TO KEEP

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.055
AT IT. SO I WILL CERTAINLY BE

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:08.594
DOING THAT. OKAY YES ARE

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:11.330
NECESSARILY A- THANK YOU

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:11.964
SENATOR BATES- I DO AGREE WITH

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:13.232
YOU WE DON'T WANT ANYONE UP

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.534
PUSHING SOMEONE INTO A FACILITY

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.269
AND THEN RECEIVING MONEY FOR

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:20.339
THAT OR ANYTHING OF VALUE- I DO

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.508
HAVE A LITTLE ISSUE WITH A

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:23.209
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE I

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:24.743
JUST FEEL LIKE THAT IS WAY WAY

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:25.945
WAY TOO MUCH I MEAN WE JUST HAD

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:27.513
A BILL LAST YEAR WHERE. IF

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.782
UNDER STAFFING RATIOS ARE MET

00:12:29.849 --> 00:12:32.685
WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIE- IT

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:34.653
IN THE FIRST FIVE VIOLATIONS

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.187
FIFTEEN THOUSAND THE NEXT

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.056
FOUNDATION IS THIRTY THOUSAND

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.891
FOOT FIFTY THOUSAND IS TERRIBLY

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.627
HIGH MY OTHER QUESTION IS I

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:45.464
DON'T BELIEVE THE SOBER LIVING

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.766
HOMES ARE REGULATED BY. DH CS.

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.401
OKAY BUT DH CS IS THE ONE WHO

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:52.304
WOULD BE FINING THEM. THAT

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.306
SEEMS THAT SEEMS A LITTLE THE

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:56.275
THEY WOULD BE THE ENFORCEMENT

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:58.544
OUR HOUSE THEY ARE FOR THE RTF

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.646
OKAY THEY WOULD HAVE THAT ALL

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:03.649
RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL OR WHEN

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.451
SOMEONE ACTUALLY COMPLAINED SIR

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:08.787
OUR- OFFENSE A COMPLAINT ABOUT

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:09.788
ONE THAT'S OPERATING THAT WAY

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:12.191
OKAY I WONDER IF THEY ARE THE

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.959
BEST AGENCY TO BE THE

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.060
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SINCE THEY

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.996
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.031
THOSE HOMES. I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:19.565
I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR A

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.867
BETTER ONE BUT- I REALLY

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.302
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING-

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.204
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:26.672
KEEP WORKING ON IT BECAUSE I

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.174
CAN'T SUPPORT IT LIKE IN ITS

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.076
CURRENT FORM TODAY- BUT AGAIN I

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.547
APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE-BILL AND MAYBE WE CAN KEEP

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:35.181
MARK. WORKING ON AND FIGURE OUT

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:43.055
A WAY FORWARD. QUESTION OKAY.

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.456
AND AGAIN CENTER BATES I

00:13:44.523 --> 00:13:47.159
APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:50.129
I KNOW THE YOU KNOW WITH HER.

00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:52.198
EARLIER IN THE STATE TIME SINCE

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:53.032
THEN TO TODAY UNFORTUNATELY

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:54.967
AND- NOT SHUTTERS SUFFICIENT

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:58.804
PROGRESS A- YES AND I SUPPOSE

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.072
THIS IN THE BEGINNING THAT THE

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.875
CHALLENGE. IS I THINK

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.378
FUNDAMENTALLY IS THAT WE CAN'T-

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:08.480
BASICALLY SAY WELL THESE ARE

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.015
SOBER LIVING HOMES AND THESE

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.384
ARE. OTHER HOUSES RIGHT SO

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.687
WHATEVER RULE WE APPLY HAS TO

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:16.388
APPLY ACROSS ALL LIVING

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.690
SITUATIONS THAT'S WHAT THE FHA

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:20.159
SAYS AND I'M AFRAID THIS BILL I

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.460
THINK THAT IS ALSO SOME ISSUES

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.630
ABOUT LIKE THE AMOUNT I THINK

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.197
THE FINES BUT EXCESSIVE AND

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.766
SARAH. AT CURRENT LAW DOES

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:28.801
ALLOW US TO GO SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.536
IF THERE'S A RESIDENTIAL

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:31.103
TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH IS

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.973
LICENSED BY DTS. THEN WE FIND

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:38.410
OUT THAT THEY ARE- MAKING OR

00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:40.813
ACCEPTING PAYMENTS. FROM OTHERS

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:44.049
FOR PATIENT BROKERING. THAT'S

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:45.651
THE ENTITY THAT IS ACTUALLY

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:48.120
LICENSED AND CAN BE PUNISHED

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.255
AND HAVE THE LICENSE THE

00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.523
REMOVED SO NUTS BECAUSE IT

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.992
TAKES TWO TO TANGO RIGHT SO YOU

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.660
HAVE TO HAVE- YET OF SOMEONE

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.427
WHO'S SENDING THE MINES ON

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:57.863
ACCEPTING THE MONEY SO- SO

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.865
FORTUNATELY THAT IS EXISTING

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.701
LAW I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:03.836
TO TAKE ANY APPROACH ON THE

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:05.170
HOME SIDE WE HAVE TO THINK

00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:07.072
ABOUT THINGS THAT APPLY EQUALLY

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:10.909
TO. ALL HOUSES. OR POTENTIALLY

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:13.379
BE YOU KNOW- IF THERE'S AN

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.347
INDIVIDUAL BUT NOT AS A HOME

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:18.250
RIGHT BECAUSE- AS MUCH AS WE

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:20.185
MIGHT WANT TO STAY SOBER LIVING

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.053
HOMES IN ANY TRIED TO

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.454
COMMERCIAL BUT THEN IT PAYS

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:24.490
REYES THAT DISTINCTION ABOUT

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:25.424
WILL THAT BY DEFINITION WHAT'S

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.226
COMMERCIAL RIGHT IF YOU'RE

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:28.861
RENTING IT TO PEOPLE DOES THAT

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:29.528
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE A

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.698
COMMERCIAL- BUT I JUST RENTING

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.000
TO SOMEONE WHO IS RE AIRING AT-

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.735
DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:39.705
YOU KNOW- AND HOW MANY OF THEM

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:41.473
HAVE TO THE INTERNET SITUATION-

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.776
SO. I DO THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:46.912
ISSUE THAT IS ON STONE RESOLVED

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.315
IN THIS BILL IS IT'S- CONFLICT

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.582
WITH SIR FEDERAL LAW AND ALSO

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.484
CIVIL RIGHTS ABOUT SAYING THAT.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.186
AGAIN THESE ARE ON LICENSE

00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.020
FACILITIES SO THE PART OF

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:56.989
HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IT'S NOT

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:57.890
LIKE YOU CAN TAKE AWAY THEIR

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.591
LICENSE- THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.560
WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.329
HAVE TO THEY'RE NOT REGISTERED

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:05.731
AND I KNOW PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.032
BUT AGAIN THESE ARE HOMES.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.200
THESE ARE NOT TREATED AS SOON

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.068
AS THE TIP OVER INTO BEING A

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.003
TREATMENT FACILITY. THEN THERE

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.471
ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT RATE

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.972
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY GO AFTER SO

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:16.008
IF SOMEONE IS. TREATING IS

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:18.477
ENGAGING IN TREATMENT. WE CAN

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:20.879
THEN- GO OVER TO THEM FOR BEING

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.147
UNLICENSED AND PUNISH THEM FOR

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.082
THAT IF THEY MAKE PAYMENTS TO

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.983
IN ESSENCE FACILITY AND WE CAN

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.885
GO AFTER THE LICENSE FACILITY

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:29.455
ITSELF. TO SAY WHY ARE YOU

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:30.389
ACCEPTING PAYMENTS YOU SHUT UP

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.057
PATIENT PROGRAM SHOULD NOT BE

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.058
ACCEPTING OR GRANT GIVING

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.394
PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE. TO ANYBODY

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.396
FOR PATIENTS RIGHT SO- SO WE DO

00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:38.897
HAVE THINGS IN PLACE MAYBE

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.566
THERE'S THINGS WE CAN TWEAK

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:41.734
ABOUT THAT ARE THINGS WE CAN DO

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.069
TO HELP SUPPORT- TO PROVIDE

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.004
MORE RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:47.940
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY ET TO

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:50.209
THAT- SO WE DO HAVE TOOLS TO DO

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:52.077
THAT. MAYBE YOU CAN FEEL WAYS

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:56.048
DANCE THOSE BUT I AM AFRAID

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.883
THAT THE WAY THE BILL IS

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.352
CURRENTLY IT'S STILL. AND FORTY

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:05.858

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.862
SPORT. BECAUSE OF THAT BUT I DO

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:10.896
