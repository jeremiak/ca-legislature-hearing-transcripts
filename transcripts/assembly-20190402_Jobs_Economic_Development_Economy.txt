AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AEROSPACE I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS HOME. TO MAJOR AEROSPACE COMPANIES LIKE BOEING NORTHROP GRUMMAN AND SPACEX. AS WELL AS A VAST NETWORK NETWORK OF SMALLER COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE THE INDUSTRY SUPPLY CHAIN. HOWEVER OTHER STATES LIKE TEXAS AND FLORIDA ARE AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO LEARN THESE COMPANIES AND JOBS TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY WE NEED THIS COMMISSION TO SUPPORT GROW AND CHAMPION AEROSPACE INNOVATION AND JOBS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BILL WITH CO AUTHORS FROM BOTH PARTIES -- AND IDEA WOULD TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. IS THERE ANYONE WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF TODAY'S BILL HERE. TO DO THAT THEY CAN REACH.

FORTY FIVE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M SCOTT MALTA I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS WE SUPPORT THE BILL. MANAGER MY NAME IS AL THE BILL. AND I AM -- NEVER SPACE EXECUTIVE -- THIRTY PLUS YEARS AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT IS BEING DONE I JUST CAN NOT SUPPORTED IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND I HAVE SOME COMMENTS IF I MAY ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT TAUGHT. WE CAN ADDRESS OUT SOON AS WE FINISH WITH THE SUPPORT. VERY WELL THANK YOU. SIR JOHNSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MELISSA MCCARTHY WITH AIRCRAFT OWNERS AND PILOTS ASSOCIATION REPRESENT -- OVER -- THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AIRCRAFT OWNERS AND PILOTS -- NATIONWIDE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW WE SUPPORT THE BILL -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE -- SOME TYPE OF NATIONAL -- REPRESENTATION SO THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE COMPARISON TO STATES WHERE THIS HAS WORKED AND WHERE THIS HAS NOT WORKED SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT -- BUT WE DO SUPPORT THAT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN. CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANYONE ELSE WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE A ANYONE WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. I GUESS YOU FIGURED OUT I WAS GOING TO TALK FOR A LONG TIME -- NOT A GERMAN -- MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- I REALLY APPLAUD THE EFFORTS BY A BY THE HONORABLE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ITS IT'S TRULY NEEDED -- COMMISSION. AND I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS THAT -- THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE -- MY CONCERN IS IS IS AS FOLLOWS -- I TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT BUT THE CURRENTS OF THE COMMISSION AS IT IS RIGHT NOWIS GOING TO CAUSES A LOT OF CHALLENGES SEE THAT. ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE -- AEROSPACE AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND AS SUCH I WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO BE LOOKED AT SEPARATELY. YOU HAVE A MANUFACTURING SECTOR VERSUS A SERVICE ORIENTED INDUSTRY THE AIRPORTS AND WHATNOT. ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT ANIMALS THE THE ONLY THING IN COMMON IS THAT THEY BOTH FLY AIRCRAFT. AND SO I THINK REALLY THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE AT THE TWO INDUSTRIES VERY MUCH SEPARATELY. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS -- THE FUNDING ALSO NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED BY THE STATE IN THE SAME MANNER IT IS PROVIDED FOR IN THE INTEREST AIR SPACE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HOWEVER AIRSPACE HAPPENS TO BE LARGER THAN ENTERTAINMENT. AND AGRICULTURE INDUSTRIES COMBINED. BUT THAT SINK IN FOR JUST A SECOND. ENTERTAINMENT AGRICULTURE IS SMALLER THAN AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. AND WE HAVE A COMMISSION ON ON ENTERTAINMENT BUT AS YET WE DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO SUPPORT OUR AIRSPACE INDUSTRY. THE LIKELIHOOD OF INDUSTRY SUPPORTING THIS ARE FUNDING THIS IS VERY VERY SLIM. RUN THE RISK OF HAVING A PAY TO PLAY SITUATION AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE A PART OF IF THE COMMISSION IS TO SERVE TWO MASTERS TO INDUSTRIES. AND THE THE THIS COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO FUND IT. THE PLAYERS TO FIND IT. HOW LONG WILL THEY FUNDED IF MONIES ARE SENT US -- SPENT ON THE OPPOSITE INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN. SO YOU HAVE LET'S SAY AN AIRSPACE PRIME. ACTUALLY FINDING THIS AND THEN ALL THOSE MONIES GET FUNDED TO GET UTILIZED IN AND BUILDING SOME NEW AIRPORTS ARE UPDATING OUR AIRPORTS WHICH I I AGREE ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED. BUT HOW LONG IS LIKE FINDING GOING TO BE AVAILABLE IF THAT'S THE CASE -- THE COMMISSION MEMBER MEMBERSHIP MUST BE MADE UP OF SEASON AIRSPACE EXECUTIVES WITH TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE MANAGED COMPANIES WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE POLITICAL APPOINT APPOINTEES ON SUCH A DESPERATELY NEEDED COMMISSION. SOMETIME AGO I AM I MADE SOME -- SEA LEVEL FOCUS GROUPS ON AEROSPACE COMPANIES SPECIFICALLY SEA LEVEL. HERE IS TO JUST SAID THAT THE COUPLE OF A OF ITEMS -- THEY ARE CITY STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHICH DIFFER SO IT'S EASIER. CORD IMPORT CHEAPER TO PAY THE FINES AND TO TRY TO MEET THEM ALL. THIS IS ONE OF THE CIOS TELL ME. I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY SOMEBODY JUST TO MEET ALL REGULATIONS I JUST PAY THE FINE. EPA'S FORCING COMPANIES TO MOVE OUT OF STATE WE NEED TO BE FIRM AND HAVING A CLEAN STATE. BUT BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT WILL BE COULD BE FLEXIBLE LÃ . I THINK THAT IS A SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT HI HOW CAN BE BE REASONABLE ABOUT SOME THE CHANGE OR BE IMPOSED ON INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO KEEP ON HERE WHILE STILL MAINTAINING IT COMING STATE. WORKMAN'S COMP IS INCREDIBLY HIGH INCOMES UP AS THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT FROM MANY FACTORS THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MUCH THE SAME AS OSHA. 8290% OF COMPANIES ARE SMALL AND THAT LESS THAN FIVE MILLION RANGE AND IT AND THEIR AND THEIR EMPLOYEES OF COURSE. SO WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THEM COMPETITIVE AND STAY IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE MUCH CHANGE A REGULATORY NOT MIND SET OF I'VE GOT YOU HERE'S THE FINE? TWO HOW CAN WE HELP YOU MAKE YOU SUCCEED. THAT'S AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE NEED TO TO DO IT JUST A COUPLE MORE COMMENTS AND I'LL BE DONE. THIS CAN ALL BE MANAGED TO WRIGGLE BIZ AND ALL WE ASK IS THAT ANOTHER SEASON EXECUTIVE RUNS IT SO THAT IT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE CALIFORNIA HAS A VIBRANT ECONOMY. AS IN THE TOP FIVE OR SO ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD AND IT IS PARTLY BECAUSE OF AIR SPACE NOT IN SPITE OF IT. WE NEED TO NURTURE IT BACK TO HEALTH OR ELSE OTHER STATES AND MEXICO WILL HAPPILY TAKEN IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RECOGNIZING THE PRESENTS A QUORUM SECRETARY CAME PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAIR CERVANTES. CHAU CERVANTES HERE BY SIR CUNNINGHAM. CHAO [inaudible] CHEN. CHEN PRESENT RAMOS. ALMOST PRESENT REAVIS SMITH. SMITH PRESENT MANAGER WITH A QUORUM. AT THIS TIME I DO WANT TO GIVE OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS SHOULD THERE BE ANY [inaudible] ASSEMBLY MENTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS OUR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS -- BILL UP -- I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WHEN I STARTED BRINGING -- THIS AN OFFICE THAT THERE'S SO MANY AEROSPACE ENGINEERS -- IN MY DISTRICT SO WHEN THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF FUNDING MECHANISM 50% COMING FROM THE STATE 50% COMING FROM OUTSIDE -- ENTITIES -- DO YOU FORESEE A POSSIBILITY IN THE FUTURE THAT THE 50% COMING FROM OUTSIDE ENTITIES COULD ON BE UP AND DOWN BECAUSE I ASSUME THAT. IS -- TO SELF INTEREST -- INITIATIVES INVOLVED -- THEY MADE NO LONGER WISH TO PARTAKE IN FUNDING THE COMMISSION THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN FOR YOUR QUESTION. YOU KNOW THE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO BE OF A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. AND IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT A PARTNERSHIP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S GOT. SOME SKIN IN THE GAME YOU KNOW AND AND THIS GOT A LITTLE HISTORY ALSO THE LAST YEAR -- WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS BILL? OUR LAST SESSION. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT -- TO EXPAND ANY STATE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMISSION AND SO THAT IS WHY. LAST SESSION WHEN INTRODUCED THIS BILL WE STARTED WITH THE WE WE WOULD YOU KNOW Q. HEARING. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WANTED TO GET SOME COMMISSION I MEAN THIS MAY NOT BE PERFECT I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT -- THERE THERE MAY BE CONCERNS ABOUT -- ABOUT -- THEY DID THE PRIVATE FUNDING OF THIS COMMISSION BUT IN A NUMBER ONE IT'S IT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING -- TO MAKE THIS A A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN NUMBER TWO BECAUSE OF THAT HISTORY THE RELUCTANCE OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT LEAST IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION -- NOT WANTING -- TO TO TO TO FIND -- THAT THIS COMMISSION. AND NOW I'M JUST TRYING TO BE -- PRAGMATIC HERE I I BELIEVE THAT -- AND AEROSPACE COMMISSION THAT ADDRESSES MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY BY THIS -- PREVIOUS GENTLEMAN -- WOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THIS COMMISSION BUT YOU KNOW A COMMISSION THAT IS HALF FUNDED BY THE STATE AND HALF OF FUNDED BY. BY BY PRIVATE -- TO BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS BETTER THAN NO COMMISSION -- NUMBER TWO THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED -- TO FRANKLY WE WE WE NEED TO HAVE A IS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR STEP UP ON THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IF IF -- IF -- THE INDUSTRY WANTS THE STATE TO CHAMPION THIS THIS -- A COMMISSION THAN WERE ASKING YOU KNOW TO MEET HALFWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I LOVE THE IDEA OF HAVING A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS I THINK IT'S GREAT. RECENT INJURY GETTING BOTH -- INTERESTS ON THE TABLE. IF THERE ARE OUTSIDE PRIVATE ENTITIES ARE COMMON TO SUPPORT COMMISSION FINANCIALLY WOULD THEY BE BARRED FROM SITTING ON THE COMMISSION ITSELF. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT QUESTION OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT. TO HAVE -- AS THE GENTLEMAN INDICATED THAT A PAY TO PLAY SITUATION -- YOU KNOW -- SO WE WE DO HAVE LIMITATIONS IN THE BILL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE THE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE COMMISSION THAT ANYONE SINGLE ENTITY CAN. CAN BE -- CONTRIBUTING TO BETTER YOU KNOW WE WE WE'RE ENGAGE IN THOSE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK BED BUT CLEARLY WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY -- NOT ONLY -- YOU KNOW -- TWO EIGHTY ANY APPEARANCE OF ANY PAY TO PLAY SITUATION. ONE FINAL QUESTION I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR ANSWERS -- HOW WERE THE COMMISSION -- APPOINTEES DECIDED I AM SURE IT'S SO ONGOING CONVERSATION FOR INSTANCE -- IS THERE ANY INTEREST OF LOOKING AT COMMISSION IS TO HAVE A BACKGROUND IN C. PORTS. EXCEPT FOR A WELL WE WE DO A SPECIFIED IN IN THE AND THE BILL HOW -- THE THE GOVERNOR THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WILL -- MAKE THEAPPOINTMENTS TO THE COMMISSION -- AND WE SPECIFY WHAT BACKGROUNDS IN A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE HAVE A YOU KNOW A A HEALTHY AND ROBUST MIX OF REPRESENTATION FROM THE LARGE -- FROM THE SMALL MEDIUM SIZE -- FROM UNIVERSITIES FROM -- FROM AIRPORTS -- AND AS WELL AS FROM LABOR AND SO -- WE YOU KNOW HAVE TRIED -- TO ENSURE THAT -- EVERY STAKEHOLDER AND AND INDUSTRY HAS A SEAT ON THE COMMISSION -- BUT I AM OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOU -- ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS ARE I THINK THIS IS A A GOOD BILL AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT -- AS A MOVES TOWARD THOSE CHANGES SO -- WILL BE ANSWERED I LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BILL -- HOWEVER TODAY I WILL BE LÃNG AWFUL CERTAINLY RESERVE MY RIGHT TO SUPPORT THE BILL IS REALLY WANT TO GET THERE -- AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET THERE IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE WITH.

SEVEN FOUR TO ESTABLISH IS THE OFFICE OF PLAYSPACE ECONOMIC STRATEGIES WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT WALL CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY RANKED HAVING THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE FOR WHICH THE ECONOMIC SECURITY REMAINS OUT OF REACH. ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC IN COMPLEX CHALLENGES FACED BY NEIGHBORHOODS THESE NEIGHBORHOOD REQUIRE DEEP ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WORK WITHOUT STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL OR REGIONAL LEVELS RE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES COULD BYPASS. HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS OF OUR STATE. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN FOUR TWO CALLS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW CENTERS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WHICH WOULD CHARGE WITHIN WHICH THEY WILL BE CHARGED WITH ASSISTING COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE BEEN FEDERALLY DESIGNED AS OPPORTUNITIES OWNS PROMISES OWNS OR ANY OTHER GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AREAS. THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY REASONS JUST SAP WISH THE OFFICE A PLACE BASS ECONOMIC STRATEGIES FIRST THE STATE CURRENTLY LACKS A CENTRAL POINT OF CONTACT. FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS TO ENGAGE WITH THE STATE. AND SECONDLY IN ORDER TO COMPETITIVELY ATTRACT OPPORTUNITIES ON INVESTMENT LEADERSHIP -- THIS LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE WILL HAVE. TO HAPPEN. ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF A PLACE BASED MODEL IS THAT IT BUILDS UPON THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF A COMMUNITY AND EXISTING PHYSICAL AND SOCIETAL AS ASSETS IN CLOSING BY STRENGTHENING IN AREAS LOCAL IDENTITY AND HIGHLIGHTING IS EXISTING RESOURCES. WILL BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO BRING IN OUR MORE ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. UP TO PARITY TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE I'M HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS PAT FONG COULD YOU SHE COULD YOU START WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS PAT PHONE KUSHIDA AND I'M PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN PACIFIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR HISTORY THE CHAMBERS THE LARGEST STATEWIDE AT THE CHAMBER IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WORK CONSISTENTLY TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY -- IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- WE OPERATE. WE ARE CHAMBER. BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE ADVOCATE AND WE DO A LOT OF POLICY WOULD BE AT BUT WE ACTUALLY OPERATE MORE LIKE AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENTITY WE OPERATE TO FEDERAL CENTERS. THE CENTERS ARE FOCUSED ON BUILDING MINORITY BUSINESS CAPACITY IN GLOBAL EXPORT TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONTRACTING WITH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION -- WE ALSO -- ARE -- AN AFFILIATE NETWORK AFFILIATE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S SPDC -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS REQUIRE -- ATTENTION VERTICALLY AROUND HOW WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK -- CREATING REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY STANDING UP AN OPPORTUNITY FUND HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE CAN TRACK INVESTMENT TO THESE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES. FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS OF WORK A VITAL TO EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WANTS TO COMPETE AND EXPAND AND WE WE KNOW. THAT NOT ALL NOT ALL LOCAL ECONOMIES DEVELOPED -- EQUALLY. COM AND CAL ASIAN CHAMBERS ONE OF THE STATE'S KEY PARTNERS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THIS BILL STANCE TO HELP AND SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ARE NOW MAJORITY MINORITY STATE AND WE KNOW THAT ALL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS ITS LOCAL. AND SOME REGIONAL ECONOMIES ARE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE HAVE AN INCLUSIVE. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY STRATEGY THAT ENABLES OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- THE ABILITY TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY THANK YOU. YEAH A FRIEND SOLO WITH A CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT. MY JOB IS TO GIVE YOU A QUICK BACKDROP ABOUT THE BILLS THAT YOU'RE ALL GOING TO BE SEEING THROUGH THE REST OF THE SESSION. THE DEAL WITH THIS QUESTION OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND HOW THEY COULD BE MAXIMIZED. INCREASE INVESTMENT IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THIS CAME OUT OF A CHANGE TO FEDERAL TAX LAW. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO TRY TO FREE UP STRANDED RESOURCES FROM CAPITAL GAINS -- WHERE AN OF THE SALE OF AN ASSET WAS CREATED AND THAT MONEY WAS STRANDED SIMPLY BECAUSE FEDERAL TAX -- A RATES WERE TOO HIGH SO WE HAVE THIS NEW -- OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WILL IN CALIFORNIA THEY BEGIN TO TRY TO CAPTURE THIS RESOURCE WHICH IS A PRIVATE EQUITY RESOURCE THAT WILL HELP BOLSTER OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THE CALIFORNIA FORWARD. AND THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT LAST YEAR SPENT A GOOD BIT OF TIME THINKING THROUGH. WHAT WHAT WOULD HELP MAXIMIZE THIS AND CAME UP WITH BASICALLY FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS THEIR OUTLINED ON PAGE OF FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS OF L. A. B.? FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE ALL GIVE THE SERGEANT -- THE OUTLINE OF A FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER AGAIN TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE THIS NEAR FIVE PIECES YOU'RE GOING TO BE SEEING PORTIONS OF IT IN THE COMMITTEES ACTIVITY -- EACH OF YOU HAVE SOME NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES OWNS IN YOUR DISTRICTS SO IT'S GOING TO BE OUR IMPORTANT FOR YOU BECAUSE LEGISLATORS OF POLICYMAKERS. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO MAXIMIZE THAT RESOURCE. AND SO OF THOSE ARE FOR ITEMS QUICKLY ONE OF THEM IS. TO GET THE JOB -- EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS TO BEGIN TO FOCUS ON HOW THEY CAN PROVIDE EXISTING RESOURCES WEATHER'S FINANCING RESOURCES OR OTHERS. THAT WILL FOCUS ON BENEFITS TO OPPORTUNITIES ON THE SECOND WOULD IS PROBABLY THE ONE THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE MOST ATTENTION TO IS ABOUT HOW STATE TAX LAW OUGHT TO CONFORM. A DO DO NOT BE OVERWHELMED BY THAT DEBATE IN THAT THAT'S THE ONLY ISSUE HERE IT'S NOT. THERE ARE OTHERS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS -- IT'S NOT IN THE PURVIEW AT THE MOMENT OF THE TAX COMMITTEES IT'S IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT YOU SHOULD PAY SOME ATTENTION TO HOW. THE STATE WILL CONFORM IT'S TAX LAW -- TO THIS -- TREATMENT OF OUR CAPITAL GAINS RESOURCES -- THE THIRD IS THE QUESTION OF LOCAL CAPACITY -- WHAT'S THE CHAIR INDICATED IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS -- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE IN ORDER THEM -- MAXIMIZE THAT RESOURCE THERE IS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDATIONS TO PUT RESOURCES INTO COMMUNITIES ARE LIVING GIVE YOU GOT A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE THE CITY OF STOCKTON. I GOT A GRANT FROM THE ROCKEFELLER -- IN THEIR SO CALLED ACCELERATOR PROGRAM AND THEY'RE GETTING ORGANIZED IN ORDER TO ATTRACT CAPITAL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR IS GOING ON IN SAN JOSE -- WE NEED TO HAVE A BROADER A CENTER RESOURCES FOR IT OF REGULATORY ISSUES ARE ALWAYS A QUESTION -- THEY AND FINALLY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS HOW DOES THE STATE MEASURE THE RESULTS OF THAT INVESTMENT. THOSE FIVE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT THE THE ECONOMIC SUMMER CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NEEDED TO BE PART OF A BROADER -- SET A POLICY CHOICES AND OF THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE SEEING BITS AND PIECES OF THOSE ARE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THAT SORT OF OVERALL -- OBJECTIVE TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OPPORTUNITY ZONE INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE SUPPORTERS THAT I WILL ALLOW THEM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS AREA -- BLAKE CHRISTIAN ATTACKS PARTNER WITH H. C. VI T. IN LONG BEACH I'VE BEEN A PRACTICING CPA FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS -- THIS THIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL TAX DIVERSIFICATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY CAREER FRANKLY. AND WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS JUST OUR FIRM. SO IT'S IT'S AMAZINGLY POPULAR MUCH MORE SO THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE -- AND IF IT FILLS A HOLE THAT WAS LEFT BY -- CALIFORNIA ELIMINATING THE REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND IT'S TO ME IT'S KIND OF THE PERFECT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TOOL -- THE YOU KNOW SO I THINK WAS VERY WELL CRAFTED I AGREE -- WITH MISTER SILVER THAT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TRANSPARENCY IN THERE ARE SOME BILLS I THINK ON THE SENATE SIDE TO INCREASE -- MEASURING THEIR COMMUNITY IMPACT AND I'M I'M ALL FOR THAT -- THE DID JUST JUST -- MY FINAL COMMENT IS. HI IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE ARE THERE BE CALIFORNIA CONFORMITY AND I KNOW THAT -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS ANNOUNCED SOME YOU KNOW SOME LIMITED PROJECTS GREEN PROJECTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- OF THAT BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WILL WILL DEPLOY IN THE NEXT NEXT COUPLE MONTHS -- WITHIN OUR FIRM -- HALF OF THAT IS GOING OUT OF STATE BECAUSE OF THE NON CONFORMITY -- A TAX A CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER CAN DO A PROJECT IN ANOTHER STATE AND NOT INCREASE THEIR CALIFORNIA TAX BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY TAXED ON IT. AND HOWEVER. TAXPAYERS IN OTHER STATES ARE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT WILL INCREASE THEIR THEIR NET TAX SO. ANYWAY THE CONFORMITY IT IS IS A REAL HIGH PRIORITY AND I KNOW CENTER HERTZBERG IS -- HAS INTRODUCED LEGISLATION SO WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT OUT BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THE HOUSE TO LOOK AT THAT ALSO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME HERE -- I MET HORTON I'M WITH -- THE MILKEN INSTITUTE MILKEN INSTITUTE IS A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT ECONOMIC POLICY THINK TANK. AND WHILE WE CAN'T. NECESSARILY SUPPORTTHE BILL IN NAME THE CONCEPT OF A CENTRALIZED -- VEHICLE AROUND PLACE BASED INVESTMENTS -- AND AND THAT SUPPORTS A FRAMEWORK AROUND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS ANOTHER COMMUNITY FINANCE TOOLS I WOULD ECHO -- THE SENTIMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY SHARED HERE AND AND THERE'S A GOOD SUMMARY HERE ON ON PAGE SEVEN OF OF THE STAFF REPORT FOR SOME. FORTY TWO AS WHAT FRED SAID -- YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW THE FEDERAL REGULATION SHAPE UP AT THAT TREASURY WHAT WHAT THE STATE CAN DO IS REALLY CLEAN IN ON THIS CONCEPT OF A A SHOVEL READY PROJECT PIPELINE WHETHER THAT COMES FROM OUR EXISTING. PROJECTS THAT THAT ARE AT OUR BOND ISSUERS OR FOR OUR OUR OUR NPOS WE CAN MOBILIZE THOSE -- TO UP TO FIND A RETURN NOT JUST FROM INVESTORS STANDPOINT BUT THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHT OUR PRIORITIES FROM COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WHETHER THAT BE HOUSING -- INFRASTRUCTURE RENEWABLE ENERGY PLAYS WE WE CAN KIND OF UP.

SMALL BUSINESSES FORM A VITAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S JOBS IN COMMERCIAL NETWORK AND I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT SMALL BUSINESSES WILL CREATE. OVER 50% OF THE NEW JOBS WILL BE WOULD BE -- CREATED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE NEXT DECADE. HOWEVER IT'S VERY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR CALIFORNIA IF A SMALL BUSINESSES TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX LABYRINTH OF REGULATIONS. THAT EXIST BOTH HERE AND IN OTHER STATES AND CAL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE A UNIQUE DISADVANTAGE COMPARED WITH LARGE BUSINESSES BECAUSE THEY TO OFF OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE FULL TIME COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL NECESSARY. TO BE AWARE AND TO COMPLY WITH THOSE REGULATIONS. THIS BILL AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE THE SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY FAIRNESS ACT CREATES A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED -- EXEMPTION THAT ALLOWS. STATE AGENCIES THE DISCRETION TO WAIVE OR REDUCE PENALTIES ARE LEVIED AGAINST SMALL BUSINESSES AND I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY FROM WHEN THIS BILL WAS CRAFTED THAT. I THINK WILL ILLUSTRATE WHY THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS SO CUTE. I SPOKE WITH A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN BACK OF BILL CALIFORNIA SHE OWNED A RESTAURANT LOCATED IN A HUNDRED YEAR OLD BUILDING. SHE I HAD AN INSPECTION ONE DAY WERE FIVE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES CAME TO HER BUSINESS AND INSPECTED NOT ONLY FOR FOOD PREPARATION BUT ALSO THE PREMISES -- SHE PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS ALL OF THE FOOD PREPARATION INSPECTIONS HOWEVER. THE AGENCIES DID HIGHLIGHT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE PROMISE THAT SHE WAS ON MOST OF THEM RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE BUILDING WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. AND SO SHE WAS ISSUED A LEVER IN DIFFERENT CITATIONS. I'LL TELL YOU THE THE NIT PICKING US OF THE CITATIONS ARE ONE OF THE CITATIONS WAS -- FOR A TWENTY FIVE CENT. COVER MISSING ON A AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET. AND THE FINE FOR THAT ONE CITATION WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FINES FOR THE CITATIONS WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT SO SHE WAS FORCED TO CLOSE OUR BUSINESS. AND WHEN SHE TOLD ME THIS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HER FACE AND SHE JUST. COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING LIKE A TWENTY FIVE CENT PLASTIC ELECTRIC OUTLET COVER WAS GOING TO FORCE HER TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES IN CLOSER BUSINESS. SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO TAKE CARE OF I DON'T TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT. ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES NOT TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ATTENTION INTENT HERE WE'RE TRYING. TO A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED ABILITY TO GIVE DISCRETION TO STATE AGENCIES WERE NOT FORCING STATE AGENCIES NOT TO FIND BUSINESSES -- WE'RE GIVING THEM DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE FINES OR ELIMINATE THE FINES IF THEY FEEL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANTED AND WE'VE GIVEN THEM SOME GUIDANCE ON WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT WARRANTED FOR EXAMPLE A FIRST TIME OFFENDER. WHEN THE IT -- VIOLATION WAS INADVERTENT WHEN THE VIOLATION WAS RELATIVELY MINOR WHEN THE BUSINESS COOPERATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND WHEN THE VIOLATION WAS CORRECTED. AND THOSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING THIS IN A TO BE CLEAR THESE AGENCIES. ARE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ALREADY WANT TO REDUCE THE FINES NOTE NO STATE AGENCY WANTS TO LEVY A FINE ON A BUSINESS THAT'S SO ONEROUS. THAT THAT BUSINESSES IS FORCED TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BUT RIGHT NOW WITH HANDCUFF THEM BECAUSE STATE LAW -- IS VERY STRICT ON WHAT THE FINES AND PENALTIES HAVE TO BE AND SO THEY HAVE NO DISCRETION RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST GIVING THEM THAT DISCRETION WITH A. B.. FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE SO WITHOUT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. ARE THERE ARE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEN UNDER THERE WEREN'T ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS -- WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AND I I THINK WE JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THIS SORT OF UNDERLYING TENSION THIS CREATES WHERE YOU HAVE STATE REGULATORS WHO WERE. TRYING TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND MAYBE -- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ARE TRYING TO COMPLY BUT WE DON'T KIND IT WANT TO CREATE A A A WAY OUT FOR THEM -- YOU KNOW IF IF THEY'RE JUST BEING NEGLIGENT THANK YOU. VENTURE MEMBERS MIKE WE OWE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION APOLOGIZED WERE GETTING EARLIER IN THE COMMITTEE LATE -- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE. A WAY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO EVADE. PENALTIES -- FOR WORKER HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS I'M AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD ARRAY IS SMALL BUSINESSES COMPRISE OF 90% OF ALL BUSINESS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE UP -- THE EMPLOYEE ABOUT HALF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR WORK FORCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT LIABILITY ON THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND THE STATE. AND IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS MADE UP OF SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDUSTRIES LIKE CONSTRUCTION JANITORIAL. AGRICULTURAL -- MOST OF THESE ARE COMPRISED OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THEY ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS -- ENDED ANOTHER THING WORTH NOTING IS THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE STRETCHED THIN -- THAT LABOR AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TODAY ENOUGH STAFF TO DO THE TO TO COVER ALL THESE BUSINESSES ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES ARE ALSO STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT -- EIGHT CAL CAL OSHA IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN HAD IT WITH CITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR NOT HAVING ENOUGH STAFF TO DEAL WITH WORKER TO WORKER COMPLAINTS UNTIMELY WAY. SO -- IT HAVING CLEAR VIOLATIONS HAVING CLEAR PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS IS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- WORKERS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR PUBLIC ARE SAFE AND IT CREATING THE SORT OF LOOPHOLE OR A WAY FOR STATE AGENCIES TO GET OUT OF COMPLYING WITH THE FLU -- VIOLATIONS THEY'VE SUFFERED IS A BAD THING -- AND IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING AGAIN THAT IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT WE HAD A A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WHO I WAS STATEMENT MAYBE DIDN'T NECESSARILY CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT WORKER SAFETY ARE UNDERFUNDED UNDERSTAFFED -- ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND LABOR AGENCIES SO THE BROAD IMPACT THIS BILL COULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW THESE AGENCIES TO REDUCE WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH PENALTIES FOR WORKER SAFETY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS MADE EVEN DOWN TO ZERO HE KNOWS. BUT WE CAN'T JUST LOOK UNDER THE LANDS OF THE IMPACT OF IT RIGHT NOW WITH THE SORT OF PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATURE AND THE CURRENT GOVERNOR WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND SEE HOW CAN THIS BILL BE USED AND WE'VE WE'VE. WE FEEL THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED. WAIT ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD RESPOND. TO THE GENTLEMAN'S -- ARGUMENT THERE AS I UNDERSTOOD IT HE'S SO MAKING. TWO MAIN POINTS ONE IS THAT -- SOMEHOW YOUR BILL WILL ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES AS THE FINE -- TO ESCAPE LIABILITY AS OPPOSED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAW AND REGULATION -- AND HIS AND OTHER POINT IS THAT. IN SO DOING I THINK THAT WILL UNDERMINE WORKER PROTECTIONS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND SUCH OVER THE LONG RUN I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD -- RESPOND TO THOSE TWO POINTS SURE WELL OUR I AM CERTAINLY VERY COGNIZANT THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS STATE REGULATION EXIST IS TO ENSURE WORKER SAFETY AND CONSUMER SAFETY SO WE WERE NOT TRYING TO JEOPARDIZE THOSE. AT ALL AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE SO NARROWLY CRAFTED THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A BUSINESS COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF UNDER THIS IT HAS TO BE. A A FIRST TIME OFFENSE. IT HAS TO BE A MINOR VIOLATION WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETHING THAT MAJOR WITH THAT AFFECTED WORKER SAFETY I DON'T DO NOT THINK WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS. THE BUSINESS HAS TO COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION WHICH MEANS IF THEY'RE TRYING -- TO TO OBSCURE THE FACT THAT THE VIOLATION EXISTED THEY DON'T QUALIFY AND THE VIOLATION MUST HAVE BEEN CORRECTED WHICH MEANS THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S REALLY HARD TO ARGUE. THAT A SMALL BUSINESS SHOULD BE FINED. POTENTIALLY A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND AND AND TO BE CLEAR THIS THIS. BILL WOULD NOT. REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO ELIMINATE THE FINE IF THE BUSINESS COULD PAY THE FINE THEN% THE FULL AMOUNT OF FINE COULD STILL BE ASSESSED IF -- THE STATE AGENCY DETERMINES THAT PERHAPS A 50% REDUCTION IN THE FINE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD BARELY BE EMPOWERED TO DO THAT. AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS. THE ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TO THRIVE MORE BECAUSE I THINK THE OPPOSITE IS VERY WE CLEARLY TRUE. THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN LABOR FEDERATION THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF WORKER SAFETY VIOLATIONS BUT IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE UNDERGROUND THAT THOSE VIOLATIONS ARE NOT CAUGHT THERE NOT BEING FIND RIGHT NOW SO. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL COULD POSSIBLY BE CONSTRUED -- TO EXPAND THEIR RANKS IN FACT I THINK IT WOULD REDUCE THEIR RANKS BY HOPEFULLY BRING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND AND INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I JUST HAD MORE GENERAL COMMENT IT -- IT OCCURS TO ME SOME OF THESE. RUN A SMALL BUSINESS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AND PROBABLY MORE PERMANENTLY REPRESENTED SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM -- I THINK YOU'RE GETTING A REALLY. VIABLE ISSUE I MEAN THE READ THE REALITY IS IF IF YOU'RE. IF YOU'RE WALMART ARE YOUR STARBUCKS OR YOU'RE A MAJOR CORPORATION YOU HAVE THE MONEY. TO HIRE LAND USE LAWYERS YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE OTHER LAWYERS YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FINES IF YOU GET FIND YOU HAVE THE MONEY. TO HIRE CONSULTANTS TO TELL YOU HOW TO NOT GET FINE YOU HAVE RESOURCES THAT CAN ALLOW YOU -- THE THE ABILITY TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE UNDER POTENTIALLY UNDER AND TO TAKE REMEDIAL ACTION -- STE A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS OR JUST SIMPLY NOT IN THAT -- CIRCUMSTANCE AND I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF REPRESENTING SOMEBODY WHO'S HIT WITH THE CIVIL PENALTY OR A LAWSUIT. AND THEY'RE GOING. EITHER I PAY THAT OR A P. THAT SETTLEMENT RIGHT PAY THAT FINE OR A WAY OFF. MARY AND JOHN AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO WALK SOMEBODY THROUGH THAT -- EXPERIENCE A CAN BE CRUSHING IT CAN BE CRUSHING TO SMALL BUSINESS AND I DON'T THINK LOOK. I'M A 100% ON BOARD WITH WORKER SAFETY CONSUMER PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BUT THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF REGULATIONS. ON SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA YOU'VE THAT I THINK THAT IS ON ALMOST UNDENIABLE. BOB SO THIS BUILDS ON AN EFFORT I'VE BEEN MAKING SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH MY SMALL BUSINESS WAYS ON BILL THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE STEP -- I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOU'RE TRYING TO NARROWLY TAILOR SOMETHING THAT GETS A REAL ISSUE AND THAT'S LIKE GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE BEFORE YOU BRING THE HOUSE DOWN ON A MOM AND POP. GIVE PEOPLE THE CHANCE TO BRING. THEIR MINOR VIOLATIONS IN THE COMPLIANCE -- AND AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD STEP UNHAPPY SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH -- I ECHO THE THE SENTIMENT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN I SPEAK WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN MY COMMUNITY RESOUNDINGLY. THEY WANT TO BE COMPLIANT THEY SIMPLY ARE OVERWHELMED OFTEN BY THE TASK AT HAND AND SO I THINK ON THE WAY THIS HAS BEEN CRAFTED IN A VERY TARGETED WAY SPEAKS TO THAT. SPEAKS TO THE IDEA OF GETTING TO YES FOR BOTH PARTIES CONCERNED AND FIND COMPLIANCE WITH STILL KEEPING OUR SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITIES THRIVING SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. WELL I WILL CLOSE BY THINKING IN THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORD AND BUT ALSO LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AFTER READING THE BILL -- AND JACK THEN READING WHAT QUALIFIES FOR PENALTY REDUCTION IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS -- THAT WERE POSED EARLIER I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK IF WE HAVE A MOTION.
